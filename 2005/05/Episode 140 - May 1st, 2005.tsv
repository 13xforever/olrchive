533990	537633	And we are still trying to get used to our new audio setup tonight, you guys.
537653	540795	So if our mics sound kind of weird, then we apologize.
540835	542496	We're trying to get used to this new studio.
543097	543977	And we're not quite there yet.
543997	545818	Yes.
546359	547099	Do you know me?
547660	548500	I am so famous.
548941	550382	We're going to talk about how we're famous.
550922	551663	We definitely have that.
553166	555308	Who isn't here tonight is Loki.
555928	556909	He's not here yet.
556949	560371	We're hoping he gets here a little bit later in the show, but he's not here right now.
560811	564814	So filling in in the meantime, we have the one and only, LikeyStyle.
565868	568510	The whiter and skinnier version of Loki.
570051	570832	Yeah, something like that.
571032	573994	Actually, try this microphone, because for some reason this one's really quiet.
574194	574775	Can you hear me now?
575095	575755	Yeah, good.
576116	579698	That one I shouldn't use because it makes my voice too loud, but this one is just fine.
579718	581140	There we go.
581460	581920	Alright, good.
582080	583661	You've got like chicken grease all over it now.
583681	584022	What the hell?
584682	587825	I licked it, actually, because I do that to things that I believe are mine.
587865	589186	I lick them so nobody touches them.
589206	590006	You mark your territory?
590127	590327	Yeah.
590547	592549	You know how when somebody asks, hey, can I have a bite of that?
592569	593069	You're like, sure.
593089	594930	Still want one?
595351	596612	At least you didn't take a piss on it.
597372	598393	Yeah, at least I'm not like a dog.
598453	599194	Yeah.
600435	603137	Also joining us, say hello to Miss DDR Angel.
604838	605239	Hi.
606540	606980	I'm here.
607320	607781	Now what?
608882	609262	I don't know.
609542	609903	Now what?
609943	610363	You tell me.
611280	611780	It's Ong!
612321	615163	Also joining us, say hello to the Ice Princess.
615663	616104	Hello!
616364	617485	God, we haven't seen you in forever.
618482	619862	Yeah, like, hi, I'm done, okay.
622003	624144	Queenie, as always, what can you say?
624324	627625	Usually when I stick something phallic in his face, he doesn't shy away from it.
627885	629045	Oh, alright.
630406	633587	We're gonna go to a quick break after this break of some opening music.
634367	635608	We got a lot to talk about tonight.
636268	645691	First off, I want to apologize if there wasn't a new intro tonight, but I've just been very, very busy with, like, moving and the Lion King, because I went and saw Lion King today.
645711	646111	Okay.
647481	649343	I saw the Lion King, I can die now.
649523	651905	Uh, question, Lion King came out years ago.
652005	654608	No, no, no, the play, stupid, the play.
655809	657731	Oh, because of course, I knew there was a play.
657991	660233	Oh my god, crawl out of that hole you've been in.
661114	662356	Fine, fine.
662616	663316	Doesn't work with me.
663977	667841	We'll be back after this break.
668061	668902	Oh god, here he is.
670373	671514	We were wondering where you were.
671714	676936	Well, maybe you're fucking up... Oh, I'm sorry.
677757	678397	I'm sorry.
679338	680538	I'm not in a fucking good mood.
680698	681339	I'm sorry.
682239	682759	What's going on?
683680	684960	I'm fucking tired!
685320	688742	I was just asleep because I've been driving all goddamn weekend!
689302	690483	I'm so damn tired!
690703	692724	And then I get here... Oh, there's a parking!
692764	695005	I'm just gonna park four fucking blocks away!
695626	696366	That'll be fun!
696386	698287	Alright, anyway, commercial break.
698775	700135	Yeah, we'll be back after this.
701036	703097	Featuring some firsts!
703497	706118	Some DDR and Guitar Freaks and Keyboard Mania.
706158	707158	Some Bobani firsts!
707958	709799	Since it is the first episode in the new studio.
709819	710679	We'll be back after this.

1067575	1073782	Gaming Radio, so uncensored that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.
1076244	1077605	Orange Lounge Radio.
1079507	1082971	Hey guys, we're back here with more Orange Lounge Radio.
1084642	1086483	Starting off in our brand new studio.
1087164	1091347	We picked up and moved the things from Folsom, and now we are in a town called Rancho Cordova.
1091387	1096850	It's all still Sacramento, so for those of you guys who are curious where we're at, we just moved down the freeway a little bit, that's all.
1098611	1104635	And I apologize because our audio levels are a little bit screwy tonight, and I really don't know the best way to fix them.
1105576	1110980	So we're just going to kind of adjust them as we go along tonight, because I know it sounds a little weird.
1111020	1112821	I think I sound very amplified, I don't know.
1113516	1118358	You're always amped up I know Jamie sounds great I always sound great
1119373	1120413	I don't know, maybe it was just the mics.
1120734	1126936	We kind of played mic roulette, too, a little bit to try and bring some quiet people up and some loud people down, but now I'm, like, too loud.
1127316	1127656	It's weird.
1128336	1128637	I don't know.
1128917	1129037	Anyway.
1129057	1131197	Turn yourself down.
1131257	1131878	Which one am I?
1132018	1132858	I don't even know which one I am.
1133238	1134219	Hello, hello, hello, hello.
1134299	1134979	Now I'm too quiet.
1135239	1135679	Hello!
1135699	1136159	Oops.
1137940	1139160	This is awesome radio.
1139360	1139741	I know.
1140141	1141221	Check, check, check.
1141281	1141761	Okay, fine.
1142141	1144162	You're listening to mic check radio.
1145323	1145503	Yeah.
1146563	1150550	Imagine that, that we got nominated for that live 365 award thing.
1150590	1151091	Two of them.
1151692	1153234	And the award show... Can I nominate you?
1153294	1154797	The award show was last night.
1154817	1155618	The name is what?
1155638	1155818	Ultraman?
1155838	1155878	No.
1156059	1158543	To retrieve my thermal container from the...
1159477	1161898	Stop distracting me over there.
1162118	1164258	So we were nominated for two Best of Life Use 5 awards.
1164278	1166199	So we went to the little shindig they had last night.
1166839	1170180	And I think we looked pretty hot, I've got to say.
1171040	1172060	We were certainly unique.
1172361	1173321	I looked very drunk.
1176802	1178322	All these random people keep coming in here.
1179383	1183264	Anyway, we're trying to do radio.
1188170	1191231	I'm just going to close my eyes so I can't see people keep coming into the studio.
1193031	1194811	The Best of Life 365 Awards were last night.
1194831	1195692	We went to the Shindig.
1196012	1198212	We didn't win, but that's okay.
1198452	1210474	We're cool with it because, you know, when we looked at the chat room, because they actually had the chat room being projected on the nearby wall so we could see the chat and see people talking about, you know, the awards and stuff.
1210754	1214095	When we looked in the chat room, there was like six or seven people yelling, Oh, hello!
1215743	1217587	Just screaming little fanboys and fangirls.
1218007	1219289	And that was so cool to see.
1219410	1224899	So I really appreciate you guys that joined us there in spirit last night and were yelling things.
1225996	1228759	Probably offending other broadcasters, but that's okay.
1229119	1231442	Some of them need their feathers ruffled a little bit, honestly.
1232503	1233985	But actually we met some very cool people.
1234145	1235947	We met some very awesome other broadcasters.
1236187	1236667	We sure did.
1237128	1238609	So we were very happy about that.
1239530	1245076	And then we also met some, well we didn't really meet them, but we also saw some people that were kind of jerks.
1245216	1247499	And we had no idea how they were winning awards, but that's alright.
1250669	1251830	That's the nature of the business.
1252051	1252752	Them's the breaks.
1253773	1254474	So we had those.
1254634	1256416	And we will break them in the future.
1257037	1260280	So we had a good time, and thanks, you guys, for getting us nominated.
1260701	1263524	Even though we didn't win, it was still cool, and we'll just try again next year.
1266368	1267569	Also, we're famous.
1268730	1272533	To anybody who saw us in the paper here recently and is tuning in because of it, welcome.
1272773	1275275	I swear our shows are usually not this disorganized.
1275695	1284301	But it's interesting because the article that ran in the Sacramento Bee, which is our local paper, pretty big paper around here, it talks about how we do the show every week in our Folsom apartment.
1284741	1288464	But when they interviewed us, it was like five weeks ago or so.
1288484	1289344	It was a little while ago.
1290105	1291146	So we've moved since then.
1291206	1292647	So we've had to been dealing with all that.
1293347	1294608	So we're not actually in Folsom anymore.
1294628	1295549	We're still in the Sacramento area.
1296634	1297596	But the story was very nice.
1297616	1298497	It was a very lovely article.
1298517	1299538	What did you guys think?
1300559	1301100	I thought it was nice.
1302221	1303102	It was nice.
1303443	1304384	I was sort of in the shot.
1307978	1309079	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1338120	1341302	Yeah, it just added to the excitement of this entire week, NBA.
1342102	1347145	He was the first comment on my live stream, he's like, I love how the only picture of me is above my foot, and I started laughing.
1348046	1348686	That was funny.
1350647	1358252	I think it would have been cool if they had actually put a picture that had him in it, but... Oh, that would have been nice, but no, that's never going to happen.
1360464	1365248	All right, well, what we're going to do now, we're going to start off the show as we usually do, although we got some tangents there, but that's all right.
1365268	1366609	I just want to talk about those things real quick.
1366629	1372013	We're going to be doing a little bit of how is your week, how is your day, where we go around and find out what's going on in people's lives.
1372573	1374294	So, and I know everybody's got a lot to say.
1374354	1376035	We weren't live last week.
1376096	1376696	We were taped.
1376736	1377737	We still had a new show.
1378517	1379498	My week was complete and utter shit.
1379518	1383461	And when I say complete and utter shit, the only way it could have been worse is if a house fell on my car, which I expected it to do on Friday.
1383541	1386684	Wednesday, I actually got up in a really good mood.
1386704	1387064	I was all happy.
1405737	1409238	Go out and my trunk is open and my window is rolled down.
1409699	1416881	They stole the CD player out of my car, the fuckers, including a really good Gorillaz compilation CD that I put together to listen to in my car.
1418302	1422643	But they didn't take anything else, which I should be grateful for because my Bond CD was in my car too.
1424444	1428666	But it just, you know, it was sort of like the icing on the cake for me that day.
1428686	1432907	I was stressed out for school and I finally just ended up staying home that day because I was too stressed.
1433948	1434388	Next day.
1435305	1442750	I get in my car, I'm driving to work, and this guy driving a taxi van pulls out in front of me and I run into him.
1444023	1455933	Um, I have, um, pretty, uh, bad muscle contusion, which, um, in, like, normal people's terms is a big bad bruise around my hip, um, and a pinched nerve.
1456974	1463179	And now I'm on Vicodin, Flexerol, and 800 milligrams of Ibuprofen and lots of alcohol to make me feel better.
1464240	1464320	Um...
1466942	1473728	I still need to find out, because it's totally not my fault, but I need to get the guy's insurance company to pay for the damages to my car.
1473848	1474849	I can't drive my car.
1476210	1482276	We can probably hammer the fender back into some kind of shape that I can drive it in now, although my alignment's a little bit off.
1482816	1486520	But it's not undriveable except the fact that the fender keeps rubbing against my right tire.
1487520	1488441	Um, nobody was hurt.
1488801	1498224	Um, well, I was hurt, but the other guy was nice, too, so I don't want to hear anyone saying, oh, well, that fucker this, or, you know, fuck him, because he was a nice guy.
1498384	1500745	He really was, and I feel bad for him, too.
1501205	1502105	Oh, thank you.
1502125	1504126	I got a yay for me being on Vicodin again.
1505086	1509228	I do actually do pretty damn good writing when I'm on Vicodin, so maybe I'll start writing again.
1510308	1510388	Um...
1513143	1519007	And then it was just a whole bunch of just different crap.
1519027	1530916	But it's been a really weird weekend because I got made moderator on the Gorillas Unofficial Board, which is one of the big ones there, run by a really cool crew there.
1532097	1537781	I also... We went to the Live 365 Awards where...
1540951	1542452	We were going to go over that later.
1542772	1546355	I won something on the little bingo thing that I did.
1546915	1549277	I'll go over that later, too.
1550038	1554441	And something else good happened, but for the life of me, I can't remember what it is.
1555561	1558424	It's like I can't remember my life anymore unless I read my damn live journal.
1559945	1568511	Other than that, though, I've been a weird combination of either going from incredibly elated to just super depressed over everything, so...
1569426	1571507	If I'm in a weird mood, blame the Vicodin.
1573028	1574908	Alright.
1574928	1576609	Yeah, and I didn't play anything.
1578570	1580331	Okay.
1580471	1581671	Let's go over to Loki.
1581731	1582211	How was your week?
1582251	1582812	How was your day?
1583052	1583592	Dare I ask?
1585063	1588186	Well, this last three weeks have sucked.
1589568	1590669	It's been just busy.
1590809	1592450	I haven't actually had time to rest.
1592951	1597516	My new job's just stressful as hell, and I'm just tired.
1598597	1603101	Yesterday, I drove 200 miles to San Francisco.
1603542	1606625	Today, I drove 200 miles to Oakland.
1607626	1613512	And mind you, this was about seven hours after I drove to San Francisco and back.
1614973	1623742	So I got back today and I'm tired and just hungry because I haven't eaten that much today and yesterday and...
1624803	1625803	Just sucks.
1625984	1627905	And then this week is going to suck more.
1627925	1631588	It's just one big huge thing of suckage.
1631728	1636071	And then Comcast decided, you know, hey, we're not going to hook up the cable right.
1636151	1638093	And then, you know, that didn't work all week.
1638173	1640715	So I couldn't actually play Final Fantasy XI or anything.
1641415	1642256	So that sucked.
1642816	1644318	So I can get back to that finally.
1644898	1647800	And then, what else?
1648421	1649261	I don't know.
1649321	1650743	Not really much of anything.
1650763	1653685	And then Jonas didn't show up with food.
1655526	1659047	Yeah, he was going to come tonight and bring food, and he's probably the only person in town that didn't show up tonight.
1659467	1659987	That's alright, though.
1660067	1664989	You know, if you make a commitment to bring food, goddammit, he better show up.
1666129	1667470	Because I count on this food.
1669210	1669551	I don't know.
1670671	1672171	So, yeah, it sucked.
1672191	1676933	Today I got to hang out with Nelly's grandparents, who can't speak any English, in fact.
1677433	1679634	They go, we can't speak English.
1679774	1681495	And English was the first thing they said to me.
1682295	1682955	So I was like, okay.
1683296	1684816	And they're all, you can't speak English?
1685817	1689818	Because they didn't know how to say, you know, can you speak Russian?
1689898	1691319	So they're like, you can't.
1692419	1693600	Or, can you speak English?
1694520	1696821	And then she kind of shook her head, like, no, that's not right.
1697141	1697341	No.
1697361	1699682	It's like, ah, wrong words!
1701003	1703324	And then she, oh, that was interesting.
1703344	1704504	Tetris?
1704524	1705024	Tetris?
1708903	1713884	No, that's not the international... It's the international game of peace, didn't you know?
1714664	1719226	You should have whipped out your copy of Tetris and been all, Do you understand, Tetris?
1720106	1723947	No, instead I played Ridge Racer and it's getting goddamn hard now.
1724207	1731749	Once you beat Pro Circuit 18, that's pretty much the actual official end of the game.
1732109	1734369	And then from there on, it's all really hard shit.
1735470	1737150	So I got to beat the devil car today.
1737899	1741101	That sucked, because it just uses nitros constantly.
1741581	1745203	But I rock, and I beat it four times, so I eventually got that.
1745623	1749165	Then I unlocked the Super Rally X car, which is all pixelated.
1749565	1750846	It has blocky wheels.
1751286	1751806	It's funny.
1752427	1753287	So I got that, too.
1753467	1753927	That was fun.
1754248	1755528	We have a comment from the chatroom.
1757409	1759731	www.orangelandradio.com Click on chat.
1759771	1763232	Legend of Zaku says, Loki, I dare you to take some of Jamie's Vicodin.
1764613	1766234	I can't swallow pills, so no.
1767256	1772040	Yeah, she's shouting no from the bathroom Yeah, she's shouting no from the bathroom
1786212	1792854	Okay, I said to myself, because I was exhausted, you know, after driving all day and just, it just sucked.
1793354	1796015	So I laid down, like, I'm just going to lay down for a second.
1796616	1804358	My mom calls me at like 6.15, says, hey, you know, she's trying to talk to me about the newspaper article because I left a message for her.
1804378	1806319	I'm like, oh shit, I got to go.
1806339	1808800	I'm supposed to be at the show already.
1809440	1809840	Damn it.
1810421	1817446	So then I get here, I have to park way the fuck down the road, and for some reason I thought Rob's apartment number was like something else than it was.
1817466	1820088	So I'm walking around going, where the fuck is it?
1820188	1821929	All these goddamn buildings look the same!
1822509	1823230	Oh, this sucks!
1823410	1824911	I live in total suburban apartment.
1824931	1827613	So then I walk down to the end, I'm like, okay, count the buildings.
1829154	1830375	Oh, okay, here we go, here we go.
1830948	1832809	And then so, yeah, but that sucked.
1836232	1837033	I'm just tired.
1837293	1838073	I'm really tired.
1838093	1850262	You know, we'll get into that all later, you know, about all the wonderful things that you encounter while driving, long distances, mainly bad drivers, you know, all that to come later on.
1850783	1851123	Lovely.
1851643	1851963	All right.
1852584	1853264	Who else is in here?
1853324	1856547	Let's go over to Arcadian42 who joined us, snuck in there a little bit.
1856587	1857107	How was your week?
1857127	1858048	How was your day, sir?
1859166	1862007	Last week I went to Jamie's party that was last Saturday.
1862027	1863807	It was pretty fun to go down there.
1864747	1869028	To MGL and Dave and Buster's.
1869048	1870569	They didn't go until since last year.
1871329	1872269	Played games and stuff like that.
1872689	1874210	Most of this week was just work.
1875330	1878711	Getting prepared for our boat loss to go to Europe for three weeks.
1880751	1882132	And so that was that.
1883092	1887393	Other than that, on Friday I went and saw Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, which is a pretty good movie.
1888033	1888353	It was a
1888783	1891945	That was a very good adaption of the books.
1893806	1897269	Sort of draws from all the books, but mostly, of course, follows the first one.
1898510	1902332	And then yesterday didn't do much, and today didn't do much, and game here.
1904754	1909537	Alright, let's go over to Ice Queen, if he can take a minute away from PictoChat.
1909557	1910298	How was your week, how was your day?
1910928	1913209	Oh, it was just wonderfully entertaining.
1914369	1917610	Actually, the past three weeks have been, you know, pretty much wonderfully entertaining.
1918251	1925713	I have, in the last three weeks, spent over $1,000 on my truck, that piece of shit that has no grill, whatever you call it, on the front.
1926213	1930115	So you look at the front of the truck and you see the radiator, which is absolutely lovely.
1931195	1935456	After that, I pretty much just have been working.
1935837	1936617	Lovely new job.
1937495	1940536	I'm a paper pusher for 10 bucks an hour, woohoo.
1943416	1944376	Other than that, not much.
1944516	1948157	Oh yeah, I decided to try to get clever with my computer.
1948517	1953698	It's had some viruses on there that aren't being detected and fixed by the Norton antivirus.
1954038	1965461	So I went in there on Friday night and followed an online chat, or an online FAQ regarding how to fix this specific virus, the isass.exe.
1966141	1966781	Yeah, and...
1967888	1980237	Not knowing any better, the fact told me that I should go ahead and go into the safe mode under administrator and change the permissions for the user to deny.
1980938	1997010	Well, me not being any more aware than I was, I went ahead and did that, which then locked up all of my Windows files, no longer had access to explorer.exe as the process, so I have no desktop, had no start menu.
1997873	2003014	and I had no access to the MS config feature, which would not allow me to go back in and change my permissions.
2003054	2007515	So I spent the whole weekend pretty much just going through my computer.
2008736	2009696	Neil, you are a dork.
2010936	2017198	Anyway, I went through and actually Neil helped me out quite a bit, did most of the work.
2017238	2020779	He went in, added the software back in there and got everything working again.
2020819	2026660	So now I'm just waiting on the operating system to load back up and hopefully I'll have my computer
2027589	2029390	Oh, and yeah, World of Warcraft.
2029450	2030390	I started playing that.
2030430	2031490	That game rocks.
2032110	2037872	It's better than Final Fantasy XI, only because you can actually solo and not have to worry about it.
2038592	2039553	So yes, it does.
2039613	2040933	Brad said that doesn't make a game better.
2041493	2042053	Oh, it does.
2042494	2043214	I am antisocial.
2043234	2043814	I hate people.
2044594	2046575	I'm still waiting for Ragnarok 2.
2047355	2052157	Then it makes the game more suited for you, because other people like to play multiplayer.
2052197	2056618	The only games suited for antisocial people are those that are offline.
2058522	2059803	Oh, you mean just all other video games?
2060023	2060223	Yes.
2061063	2061303	Okay.
2061384	2065205	You can play Ragnarok Online completely antisocial, because I leveled myself into the 80s.
2065446	2065626	Yeah.
2065726	2066186	By myself.
2066326	2070208	Oh, Ragnarok Online's the ultimate solo online RPG.
2072449	2078792	I don't know, actually, this Guild Wars game everybody's been talking about sounds like a very solo-friendly game.
2079073	2080713	The Blue Burst beta will be out in a few weeks.
2081814	2083615	But do we get to play Blue Burst?
2084575	2084956	No, US beta.
2086021	2087683	Do we have to pay monthly fees to play it?
2087883	2088483	Not for the beta.
2088944	2089084	Oh.
2089784	2090065	Okay.
2090385	2091126	Well, anyway.
2092627	2093207	What are you doing?
2093227	2096010	You're sitting there playing as DS, and you should be doing a radio show.
2096791	2098892	I wanted to join the PictoChat orgy, so shoot me.
2098932	2099633	Hey, don't go anywhere.
2099653	2100033	How was your week?
2100053	2100514	How was your day?
2100654	2101094	Like you still?
2102596	2103336	Oh, fabulous.
2104337	2107400	Um, no, it's been kind of sucky, uh,
2108760	2118143	Me and the Rice Princess both have jobs now, and it's kind of hard to, when you only have one vehicle, to get everybody where they need to go.
2118223	2128226	So we've been looking for a car, and every single time we go to go check out a car, it is apparent within a few minutes that the people do not know what they're talking about and do not know how to take care of their vehicles.
2128907	2130567	So, yeah.
2131868	2132528	So far, no luck.
2134391	2136392	Oh, I went and saw Hitchhiker's Guide also today.
2136992	2137733	We both went and saw it.
2138373	2138893	And it was good.
2139213	2139533	Liked it.
2141374	2144355	I think it's a sci-fi movie for even non-sci-fi fans.
2144775	2145716	Like, even they would like it.
2146316	2148677	My favorite part, and it's a big spoiler.
2149537	2150498	I feel like a sofa.
2150538	2151318	I think I'm a sofa.
2153699	2155980	That one's pretty funny, but I love the whale.
2156360	2158181	Yes, yes, the whale.
2158221	2158941	It's not a spoiler.
2161007	2164488	Well, no, I doubt anybody, like, not many, many people have read this book.
2164508	2166129	It's kind of a cult thing.
2167249	2167449	Yeah.
2167469	2170290	A bunch of people have read Hedgehog, Crash Guard.
2170470	2178113	Yeah, like, but, when you say a bunch of people have read it, it's like, nothing compared to, like, how many people have read the Bible.
2178753	2189257	You know, just because, like, a few thousand people here and there have read a book, that may be more than I have ever met in my life, but hey, it's... Yeah, it's not a huge thing, so, whatever.
2190751	2195956	I just wanted to share with the chat room that they're not the only ones who feel like they have not seen the movie because I have not seen the movie.
2196176	2197858	So don't feel too left out, you guys.
2198438	2199259	I'll see it eventually.
2199519	2200480	Did you see Kung Fu Hustle?
2201461	2201942	Oh my god!
2202042	2203143	Go see Kung Fu Hustle now!
2203904	2211170	Honestly, if I had to choose between movies to see, the one I went and saw, The Hitchhiker's Guide, I would have rather seen Kung Fu Hustle.
2211931	2214894	No, I haven't seen Kung Fu Hustle yet, but I saw Hitchhiker's Guide and...
2215692	2218275	Oh, Kung Fu Hustle's friggin' awesome.
2218375	2219356	You know what I want to see?
2219877	2223561	What I would like to see is not paying $10 to go to a goddamn movie.
2223661	2224462	That's what I would like to see.
2224602	2225523	I didn't pay for it.
2225623	2226544	Like, you need to do that.
2226564	2231950	You just go find the attractive-looking gay guy at the movie theater place and just say, Hey...
2233423	2235984	Yeah, because that's the universal mating call, you know.
2236344	2239085	Hey, what the fuck is wrong with you?
2239866	2245368	Anyway, my week and my day, it's just been very busy with all the moving stuff that's going on.
2247568	2248549	What more can be said?
2248689	2256632	I'm just so busy, but I'm so happy to have it all done, and I'm finally moved in here, and I'm getting comfortable in here and all that, and
2257799	2263504	Finally, things will settle down, and then E3 is just around the corner, and then we get to go into panic mode again, so that should be exciting.
2264024	2264765	We'll see what happens.
2265926	2266226	Alright.
2267107	2273171	Anyway, what we're going to do now, and I'm still adjusting the sound levels, kind of as we go along here, so I apologize.
2274472	2275573	Is this my mic here?
2276014	2276354	I don't know.
2277315	2278496	Maybe you should figure it out.
2279116	2279597	I don't know.
2279757	2280598	I'm so lost.
2280698	2288988	Anyway, what we're going to do now is we're going to take a break and we're going to play some new poppin' music during this break.
2289028	2289789	It's brand new.
2289829	2291070	We haven't played this on the station yet.
2291471	2292432	It's Poppin' Music 12.
2293988	2298469	Although it's really Papa Music Iroha, but it's just freaking Papa Music 12.
2298509	2302690	They're just trying to give it new names so that you'll forget that there's so damn many of these games.
2303130	2303830	Like 2DX.
2304190	2306331	Yeah, but there's a lot of good music in this one.
2307871	2311852	Starting off with a remix of Star Mine, it's pretty interesting, so I'm going to start off with that.
2311992	2314293	Also in this, you're going to hear some new Akira Yamaoka.
2315353	2320594	A remix of the theme from Goemon is in here, and then a new Good Cool song is in here as well.
2321015	2322635	So we're going to hear all that during this break.
2323235	2331436	and we'll be back with more Orange Lounge Radio Orange Lounge Radio

2822435	2823556	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2843158	2843618	Move this way.
2843658	2844599	No, no, don't hit the wall.
2844639	2845059	Don't do it.
2845179	2847201	I greatly appreciate the presence of the chair in here.
2847321	2847661	That's nice.
2847701	2849262	And then behind DarkSakura.
2849282	2853064	Now, she doesn't let us put her on the webcam, so we can't really show you, but maybe we'll take a picture or something later.
2853404	2857667	But you can see the Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back poster that says, All you motherfuckers are going to pay.
2857707	2858708	You are the ones who are the ball lickers.
2858968	2862310	We have that right behind Jamie's chair, appropriately enough, I think, for her.
2862630	2864611	You are the ones who are the ball lickers.
2864751	2865171	Thank you.
2866552	2871375	Anyway, so during the break there, we were listening to some music from the new pop and music, Uroha.
2871755	2872296	What do you guys think?
2874383	2874943	DarkSakura.
2875323	2875924	It sucked.
2875964	2877825	It sucked.
2878245	2879545	The Starmine remix, you guys didn't like it?
2880386	2881566	I thought it was cute.
2882247	2883087	I don't think it's that bad.
2884548	2885508	I didn't hear the Starmine one.
2885528	2886469	I only saw the Goemon one.
2887069	2887289	What?
2887529	2888870	The Goemon one was excellent.
2888890	2890450	What did you think of the Kiriyamaoka track?
2890751	2891851	There's two of them in pop music.
2891891	2892311	I played one.
2894632	2897714	It was that second song that played in between the Goemon and the first one.
2898854	2900375	No, it's the other one, not Ryusei Honey.
2900743	2909066	I couldn't pass that song for the longest time because of the crack baby I had to have somebody hold a towel over the video and then I could pass it
2929608	2930549	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2960922	2961162	Yeah.
2961262	2962323	Well, unless you're in the play.
2963024	2964065	Yeah, unless you're in the play.
2964686	2967448	I think it's bugging the hell out of you just because you can actually hear your voice now.
2967969	2970191	It's different, and I don't like different things.
2970311	2971192	That's my problem.
2972333	2973374	Hey, you, you're different.
2973434	2973775	Get out.
2974615	2975256	Let's beat him up.
2975296	2975797	He's different.
2978059	2978319	All right.
2978639	2980101	You're not wearing a silly hat.
2981033	2982314	DarkSakura's birthday party
3003167	3009996	But we went over to Milpitas Golf Land to play and I saw Drum Mania V and I was like, hey, it's Drum Mania and I fucking suck at it, so I'm gonna go over here to Guitar Freaks.
3010297	3013842	I didn't even bother to check out V. So, how is the V series?
3013882	3014783	I haven't even really looked at it.
3015754	3019957	Well, I only really got one play in because I was running low on time there.
3020218	3025382	So I only got one play at Guitar Freaks V. They didn't have Drum Mania V at our golf land up here in Roseville.
3026883	3028364	So that's unfortunate.
3029025	3030446	I prefer Drum Mania over Guitar Freaks.
3030466	3030866	So whatever.
3030926	3032808	I got to play one game of Guitar Freaks V.
3033448	3038611	The song selection, I think, is better than some of the previous ones.
3038831	3044415	Because to me, after Guitar Freaks 5, the song selection has kind of gone downhill.
3044475	3047776	I mean, when they got rid of... Was it...
3049458	3050258	Haru's Spring
3066773	3068154	So it's good.
3068514	3070475	The videos are definitely nice.
3070715	3077139	They added that nice quality full motion video and things like that that was in 2DX.
3077699	3081181	That's nice, but you don't really have time to sit there and look at the videos when you're playing the game.
3081301	3087365	So it's not really a very interesting new addition or useful addition.
3087825	3091229	Other than that, you know, it seems like it's pretty much just the same old Guitar Freaks.
3091269	3105645	It's got, looks like the resolution looks higher, you know, it looks more clear, so you're looking at the notes, look like they scroll smoother, and it's like the fifth mix of Guitar Freaks, basically, like GDR fifth mix, you know, how they added that.
3106486	3108188	I mean, but other than that, it's no real big
3108632	3117240	Woo-ha, wow, awesome new Guitar Freaks, so... I'll have to go check out the Drum Mania V first before I can give my final answer.
3117260	3118121	Because I want to play a session.
3118161	3119522	I haven't played a session in a long time.
3121584	3122205	I know, what's up with that?
3122225	3128310	Like, Golfland and all those places don't really have, like, the session mode like they used to, and the session was so cool when they had it, and now it's gone.
3129231	3134516	Yeah, they really should get a Keyboard Mania V to go with the Guitar Freaks Drum Mania, because...
3135165	3138307	The Keyboard Mania may not have been nearly as popular as the other games.
3139047	3141048	It was fun to have the four-person session.
3141248	3142809	That was always good times.
3143990	3145251	I still want Sax Mania.
3146091	3147352	Sax Mania, oh yeah.
3148432	3148892	Or what was it?
3148913	3149533	Sax Freaks.
3149613	3150393	What was the other one?
3150453	3152975	It was the Head Mania?
3153775	3155156	The pole that you just, yeah, anyway.
3155666	3156486	Sax Machine.
3157527	3157787	Anyway.
3158607	3165790	Arcadian42, I know you're big on the Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania series, so I'm curious, you at Milpitas Golf Line got to check out Drum Mania Vs, so I'm kind of curious what you thought.
3167031	3169232	That's pretty much similar, it seems.
3170292	3173454	I didn't really notice the videos or anything, just because I wasn't really looking at them.
3173494	3175194	I was looking through the song list.
3175214	3176655	Song list seems pretty good.
3177355	3182277	I noticed there was a lot of older songs that they brought back from various older mixes.
3182978	3183458	So, like,
3184167	3186908	Void, and what was the other one I really noticed?
3188468	3189208	Crap, I can't remember.
3189348	3190949	Wild Ride, which only showed up in one.
3190969	3194630	It was like a special track in one of them that only showed up in that one.
3194650	3195850	It was like seventh mix, I think.
3197951	3199651	And, yeah, it seemed pretty good.
3200391	3204292	The way they do the song select, it only shows like five or six songs at a time.
3204312	3207813	It makes it harder to see what songs are in it, so that was probably the bad thing about it.
3209194	3210574	But otherwise, it seemed pretty cool.
3211806	3219134	I'd have to play it more, because I only played it twice, and then we had to run off to Dave & Buster's, so I didn't get to have that much chance to play it.
3219415	3225742	I haven't been to Roseville Golf Land in like two months, so I can't really comment on Guitar Freaks V yet.
3227124	3228225	But, yeah, it seemed all right.
3230662	3237744	You know what's interesting is that while you guys were checking out V, I was actually checking out 11th Mix of Guitar Freaks finally for the first time.
3238264	3243766	And it's fun, it's very pink, but you know, I had a good time and I played it, so you know, what can I say.
3243886	3246666	Did you check out any of those Guitar Freaks, Guitar Mania?
3246846	3247567	I played Beat Mania.
3248087	3248847	You were playing Beat Mania?
3249087	3249747	Beat Mania the final?
3250007	3250187	Yeah.
3250307	3251328	Was that the first time you checked that out?
3251768	3251908	No.
3252228	3252488	Oh, okay.
3252508	3252628	Yeah.
3253308	3258210	You know, one game, though, I want to kind of transition to this topic because there was another game you got to check out for the first time.
3258230	3258650	Oh, God.
3259670	3260230	Tell us about it.
3260490	3262451	I played the retard game, I mean, in the groove.
3263851	3265732	And no holds barred from you, apparently.
3267093	3267973	It had good music.
3268553	3270814	Everything else about it was utter and complete ripoff.
3271214	3274535	I also don't like that you can't go backwards in the menus.
3275091	3279813	I realized that for the first time as well the other day when I fucked one of my modifiers severely.
3279913	3280834	I could not go back.
3281414	3285696	Unless there's a way you do it differently than DDR, but I figured everything else was the same as DDR.
3286236	3288978	So the way you would move back would be the same, and it doesn't work.
3289198	3289998	It was just really stupid.
3290018	3290759	Here's how you go back.
3290799	3292539	You fail your first song and put more coins in.
3295241	3297142	What an ingenious idea on how to make more money.
3297602	3300763	It really wasn't that much of an... It wasn't really an innovation at all.
3301023	3302024	And the songs were longer.
3303010	3307651	which in some cases was okay, but overall, the steps were awful.
3307811	3308632	I mean, really awful.
3308672	3310232	It felt like playing a Korean mix.
3311332	3312953	Korean third?
3313853	3320315	There were some good steps in Korean third, but I'm talking about how many jumps there were in everything, which I really hate doing.
3322215	3326597	It was like playing Konami of Hawaii steps.
3328197	3329097	That's how it was.
3329878	3331418	That's a bad inside reference.
3332884	3337169	So, but you don't mean like Ultramix 2 steps, because those... I mean like Panomics.
3338571	3343477	Oh, or like, um, uh, Service, or, I keep saying Service, Songpacks 1 through 6.
3343837	3344097	Yes.
3344478	3344598	Okay.
3344658	3345379	Like playing those.
3345559	3345840	Okay.
3346914	3348155	I keep saying Service Pack.
3348335	3350657	I always say Service Pack because I get it confused with Microsoft.
3350917	3352258	Songpacks 1 through 6 then.
3352678	3352938	Yeah.
3353058	3353338	Yeah.
3353699	3357101	That's how, that's, it was Konami of Hawaii Steps.
3357481	3362785	You know, I've actually played in the groove probably two times, at least two times this week, if not three.
3363025	3363285	I don't know.
3363325	3363886	I've lost count.
3364526	3366968	I'm warming up to it a little more.
3367915	3369656	But, I don't know.
3370636	3377239	So, I still, I'm like, I feel like this is just something to hold me over until the real thing is back.
3377579	3385983	I feel like I've gone from regular soda to diet soda, and I'm still trying to get used to that nasty aftertaste that you get from diet soda.
3386443	3387463	That's kind of how it is.
3387563	3392045	And like, I'm like, you know, as soon as they come out with a new flavor of soda, I'm going to go right back to it.
3392785	3394246	That's how I feel about this whole thing.
3396546	3400330	Once they put the cocaine back in the Coca-Cola, you'll be ready to go.
3402252	3404574	Then you won't need the diet because the cocaine will take care of that for you.
3404714	3405915	Well, so here's the interesting thing.
3405975	3407957	What do you think it's going to be like on PlayStation 2?
3409779	3411080	I haven't put much thought into it.
3411741	3413022	It's not like I'm going to waste my money on it.
3413382	3414203	Well, here's the interesting thing.
3414263	3416905	You might want to start thinking about it because guess where we're going on Wednesday?
3417426	3418547	You and I. That's true.
3418627	3419148	There's that.
3420242	3427468	So somehow we have managed to get an invite to the In The Groove premiere party in San Francisco.
3428268	3431251	So we're going to go check out the In The Groove on PlayStation 2.
3431911	3432772	And here's the great thing.
3433312	3435334	The invite said, now, I haven't told you this.
3435374	3438156	I was waiting for the show to tell you this, specifically on the show.
3438937	3439597	Free drinks.
3440638	3441599	Oh, cool, liquor!
3443220	3448424	Now, what I'm curious about is what if for every drink you have to say something nice about In The Groove?
3450427	3450707	Lame.
3452007	3452988	I like this song.
3453008	3454988	This song's cool, too.
3455008	3457208	It doesn't suck that much.
3457268	3458729	I need to download this song.
3460969	3467951	Which is interesting because one of the... My biggest problem within the group is that I... Like, half the songs don't do it for me.
3468651	3472712	Like, I'm not as big on the song list, but... I like the hip-hoppy ones, actually.
3473552	3476553	See, that... I guess that's where we differ because I don't care for those tracks.
3476573	3478113	The trance I can do without because trance is...
3479420	3487248	See, I actually like the really stupid, dancey covers of Mouth and Torn and all that stuff.
3487508	3491732	I want innovation in music, and all trance is is rehashing.
3491913	3492693	That's all it is.
3493054	3495136	Let's add some synthesizer to it and call it music.
3496724	3498346	Here's the issue with trance.
3498406	3501970	It's all just disco sped up with lots of synthesizers.
3503071	3507876	Disco, you know, well, there's a lot of dancing involved in disco, so I guess it works.
3507957	3511821	But there's just not a lot of talented trance artists out there.
3511841	3514504	You gotta go to the very select few artists like...
3515541	3518082	One I'm really big on right now, Yuzo Koshiro.
3518302	3520963	He does an awesome soundtrack for that One Gun Midnight Maximum.
3522124	3524865	Yeah, just very few good artists will do trance well.
3524925	3527746	So most of the time you're just going to find shitty trance tracks.
3527886	3531127	Yeah, like just about what you find on every single compilation out there.
3531267	3531908	Yeah, exactly.
3533028	3541672	And to me, my favorite trance, the songs that I think are actually good trance songs are done by artists who don't technically, they don't really do trance typically.
3541852	3542312	They do normal...
3542592	3545037	Like Delirium, there's a song I'm really loving.
3545217	3546018	Maybe I'll tell you about it later.
3546038	3546359	Whatever.
3548453	3551314	Yeah, his microphone's on, but these mics are acting very weird.
3551334	3551614	I don't know.
3551674	3556735	I think it's because this one's a cardio, so it depends on... It's because Rob's too loud and Brad's too quiet.
3557635	3558235	That's what it is.
3558395	3559636	I can't make them both work.
3559656	3561496	There's no perfect medium, you know?
3561516	3562036	No, there isn't.
3562416	3570238	It's either you talk too close to the mic, you being Rob, because obviously pointing does not really, you know, show its way through radio.
3570978	3572019	There's the camera.
3572059	3572619	They can see it.
3573259	3574379	You're pointing at the camera.
3574419	3575279	You're pointing at the audience.
3575299	3575499	You!
3575659	3576080	Camera!
3576340	3577560	You are talking too loud.
3577620	3577700	No...
3578300	3588308	No, honestly, because I'm talking and I'm starting to, like, you know, static out and I'm not even hitting a peak yellow yet, which means that there's something too loud somewhere.
3588588	3591770	I don't even know what the hell you guys did to this board here.
3591790	3595773	I don't know where to... You jinxed it with Judo Curse.
3595873	3596394	I don't know.
3597915	3601638	But anyways... Check the levels going into the computer.
3601658	3602378	I checked.
3602538	3603639	Look at the hardware in the computer.
3603739	3604060	Jeez.
3607043	3607423	Anyways.
3607663	3608704	Turn down the mic boost.
3609824	3613146	What we might want to do is maybe do a mic shuffle back to the mics we used to have.
3613886	3614226	I don't know.
3614386	3615447	Mic shuffle.
3617167	3620089	I'm on the mic that I used to be on and I'm still fine.
3620509	3620929	I don't know.
3621069	3622009	It's just... It's nothing.
3622029	3622770	I'm not going to worry about it.
3622830	3625411	It's something that I turned up and I'm trying to... Moving forward.
3625551	3626431	Yeah, moving on.
3626491	3627052	I'm sorry.
3627132	3628832	It's just, you know, the sound issues are important.
3628892	3630053	If they can't hear us, you know...
3630552	3632053	If they can't hear us, they can turn up the radio.
3632073	3639916	If you're just joining us, we are doing our first show in the brand new studio, so we've got audio issues tonight, but hopefully we will be able to make everything work out.
3640017	3642298	So just bear with us, and we'll get through this.
3642478	3644419	It also could be that these headphones suck.
3644659	3646039	It might be, so I'm not going to worry about it.
3646680	3651382	The chat room has been yelling when levels are fine, I don't know, so maybe you want to pay attention to that.
3651402	3652302	Yeah, but it's on delay.
3652642	3653663	Yeah, I know, it doesn't help.
3654571	3656553	Alright, let's try leaving the audio here.
3656653	3658094	Let's switch back and just see what happens.
3658114	3659315	It looks like our audio is okay now.
3659516	3659856	I don't know.
3660296	3660837	It's hard to tell.
3662779	3663439	So we'll see what happens.
3665842	3666382	Moving on.
3667303	3669665	So we have that In The Groove thing going on Wednesday.
3670286	3674550	Let's try to think what else is going on in the Bomani world right now.
3680379	3687481	Anything, DarkSakura, that you would like to see in the In the Groove release on PlayStation 2 that you didn't see in the arcade game?
3691082	3691882	Lack of suckage.
3696384	3702726	It didn't 100% suck, but honestly, it's not DDR, you know?
3703666	3705587	It's like a big rip-off of DDR.
3705667	3706587	I can't get into it.
3707119	3711222	I cannot look at that game without thinking, wow, they totally bid on DDR.
3712883	3714043	Sorry, that's how I feel.
3716925	3717866	Oops, my mic was off, sorry.
3718046	3719166	That's alright, you're welcome to your opinion.
3722388	3726451	What we're going to do now, let's move into talking about last week's show.
3726491	3732634	And last week's show, we actually had not one, but two cage matches that took place last week.
3732654	3736697	And it was a tape show, and I hope you guys were able to tune in and check it out.
3737407	3740669	And in that, we did two cage matches.
3741210	3745152	The first cage match was talking about the ultimate cage match.
3745552	3752557	In other words, we've had three songs that have been retired from Orange Lounge cage match, meaning they won four weeks in a row.
3752917	3759822	So we decided to face off each of those songs against each other and see what the ultimate cage match victor would be.
3760142	3762784	So are you guys curious to hear which song won that?
3763864	3764125	Sure.
3764545	3766026	Alright, based off your votes...
3766824	3770526	on OrangeLoungeRadio.com because that's the way we voted in both cage matches this week.
3770947	3786896	The winning song of the ultimate cage match, meaning that this is just like the best song I guess you guys think we've played in the past hundred episodes we've been doing the cage match, is... Echo Image with Come Back.
3786916	3787096	Woo!
3790899	3794762	That was our ultimate cage match, because we did each song that got retired.
3795342	3796303	Pay attention, like you still.
3797984	3801067	Alright, so Echo Image will come back was the winner.
3802788	3812195	Also, we did another cage match, and that cage match was choosing which song should be banned from Orange Lounge Radio forever.
3812736	3813076	Okay?
3813556	3814997	And we let you guys vote on that.
3816318	3818440	And it's what we call a reverse cage match.
3820733	3822955	And you guys picked a winner.
3822995	3825116	I guess really more appropriately, it would probably be a loser.
3826517	3830739	But the songs that were up were Britney Spears with My Prerogative.
3831780	3832660	And that was Jamie's pick.
3832680	3837943	And then I picked DJ Speedo featuring Wild Side with the Catch-Up song.
3838524	3843827	And then Loki picked Kids Bop Kids doing Bring Me to Life with Corky.
3845828	3846528	Wake me up.
3847068	3847869	Wake me up!
3850120	3853562	Alright, do you guys want to know what song is being banned from Orange Laundry Radio forever?
3855263	3855664	Here it is.
3862128	3868432	So, Kids Bop Kids, Bring Me To Life, banned from the station forever.
3868552	3870573	Good riddance, you piece of shit song.
3872534	3872754	Yes.
3873655	3875216	Do you have a cage match pick today already?
3876297	3876677	Yes, I do.
3879087	3879988	Is it that Delirium thing?
3880488	3881769	I told you I put that song in already.
3882990	3883230	Yes.
3883850	3884330	Long time ago.
3888573	3889953	Oh, maybe I'm confused.
3889973	3890254	Whatever.
3890374	3890674	Who cares?
3892055	3892675	Alright, anyway.
3892695	3892735	Um...
3895762	3900725	What we're going to do now, we're going to go to a break, then we're going to come back and get into a couple other topics in tonight's cage match.
3901145	3911230	I figured to humor the discussion we've been having, I'll actually, and our chat room has kind of been asking for this for a little while, so I'm actually going to play some music from In the Groove for you guys.
3912491	3917814	So, enjoy, and we'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio. ...
4034273	4035895	Thank you for watching!
4066760	4068386	Thanks for watching!
4110481	4124555	Charlie's body lets me die So please take care of yourself Don't give away everything you own Cause no one will give you back The innocence that you have lost Charlie, you're still getting a sister of mine
4152158	4153099	Thanks for watching!
4410815	4419278	Hey guys, we're back with more Orange Lounge Radio.
4419318	4423920	Yeah, the new promos was something else on the list of things to do that didn't get done, but we've just been busy.
4423960	4431342	You heard about our dramatic week, so, you know, we'll just get past it and, you know, do something more constructive later on.
4431662	4438105	We are going to open up the Skype line very, very soon, so head on over to www.orangeloungeradio.com and click on Interact With Us.
4438145	4439105	If you have no clue...
4439551	4443834	What I'm talking about, because that's the only way you guys are going to get to call in and interact with our station.
4444374	4446955	First, though, I want to point out the songs that we played in that break.
4446995	4455420	We played Banzai with Anubis, Missing Heart, Charlene, Smiley with Shusha, and Ka with Dawn.
4455580	4458782	Now, here's the interesting thing about Dawn.
4459703	4460944	And I hope I still have this.
4461024	4462124	I hope I didn't get rid of it.
4462184	4463265	I'll be pissed if I did.
4464005	4465907	I probably did and didn't even realize it.
4467327	4468148	Shoot, I think I did.
4469405	4471346	Let me run a search real quick.
4471366	4479050	Well, we actually used to spin the song Dawn on our station like a long time ago when we first started.
4479391	4485294	And it was one of those, this isn't in a Bomani game yet, but it will be someday, we think.
4485655	4488656	And heaven forbid, it actually did show up in a game.
4489057	4494420	Although it wasn't really a Bomani game, it was more of a, you know, one of Bomani game, but I don't know.
4496380	4497482	Wannabe Monty, get it?
4497562	4498203	Wannabe Monty?
4498384	4498844	Wannabe?
4499986	4501189	I read that on a forum somewhere.
4501209	4501850	I thought it was funny.
4504194	4505236	Darn, I wish we had it.
4506164	4508605	I think I actually, oh no no, I do have it, listen to this, listen to this.
4508945	4511206	This is dated July 23rd, 2002.
4512666	4514707	This file's dated July 23rd, 2002.
4515667	4517447	That's three years ago.
4518008	4523089	And now, an original work that could one day very well be in a Bomani game.
4523609	4526330	This is Kiel with the song Dawn.
4526650	4532812	If you like what you hear, visit www.amcast.com slash K-E-E-L.
4534774	4543576	See, that was like, I don't know how long ago, July 2002, and I don't even know if that website exists anymore, and he changed his name and all that stuff too, so very interesting.
4543916	4550077	So, let's see, we played that before it was in a music rhythm game.
4550177	4555378	I think we've had, what, three songs from our cage match that ended up in a music rhythm game that we played here first, so, you know.
4556298	4557578	I just like thinking we're cool.
4558198	4559698	Inflate my ego here a little bit, please.
4561819	4562099	All right.
4563041	4564605	Anyway, let's do this.
4564625	4570257	We're going to open up the Skype line, so go ahead and give us a call, and we'll hear from what you have to say.
4570277	4573123	If you want to talk to us about what we let him talk to us about tonight.
4575778	4579001	In The Groove, The Award Show, if you guys were listening last night.
4579101	4580563	Just whatever's on your mind.
4580623	4581203	I really don't care.
4581343	4587549	We need to talk about Renee Sebastian and her chef, you know, Miss Chef is what I'd like to call her.
4587789	4588390	Yeah, what was it?
4588670	4591233	Those artists that played in the Live 365 Awards.
4591293	4599460	Now, I had a lot of respect for those folks because they were very passionate and very talented, unlike a lot of folks I see on the television.
4599981	4600201	But...
4601115	4602056	I'm so in love with you
4617851	4623876	I want you to lay me down, and start screwing me up and down, and then you're gonna come into me.
4623996	4627119	I swear to God, that was one of the lyrics, like, you're gonna come into me.
4627459	4629501	And I was like, oh my God, this chick is foul.
4629601	4631363	And the gospel people were there too.
4631383	4633925	What's great about the song is it went on too long.
4634005	4642192	It's like, and then I want you up and down, up and down, around, up, down, up and around, in, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
4642512	4647134	Suddenly she was singing DDR Steps and how to find her G-spot.
4647734	4649135	Anyway, we're going to take a call.
4649175	4650155	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
4650175	4650515	Who's this?
4651595	4656917	Emerging from the shadows of Imani style, your resident 2DX bastard, DarkLionXVI is here.
4657538	4659618	Alright, alright, alright.
4659698	4661059	Everyone doesn't need their own intro.
4661099	4664460	We're not going to do this WWE style.
4665761	4669202	It's Kinsville with the Rock is Cookin' and just play the music.
4669242	4670242	Anyways, go ahead.
4670783	4671203	Whatever.
4673937	4675278	You just got told, what Emma?
4675358	4676178	He said, what Emma?
4677819	4678799	What's on your mind, Siggy?
4681080	4683461	Congratulations on your new studio.
4684261	4684741	Thank you.
4684841	4690103	It's actually kind of a little bit of a downgrade, but the apartment itself is very, very nice.
4690203	4692204	So, you know, I'm very happy with it.
4692304	4695045	And we like being cozy, don't we, kids?
4695565	4697526	I can reach out and touch Jamie in the studio.
4700187	4700587	My knee.
4701227	4703188	That was the sound that she made when I touched her knee.
4705225	4706105	No, we like it.
4706145	4706426	It's cool.
4706446	4707706	We're going to do a lot of good things here.
4709287	4709687	So thank you.
4710447	4710707	Yeah.
4711007	4711968	What else is on your mind, buddy?
4712548	4720872	Well, you know, last Friday I was able to play 2DX Red, and I was able to pass three Level 8 plus songs.
4724353	4724813	Which ones?
4725894	4729535	The three songs are Take It Easy, Setsugekka, and Rainbow Rainbow.
4730796	4732637	So wait, you played them and passed them?
4732677	4733657	Yeah, I passed them all.
4734420	4735360	Well, you big stud.
4738081	4746103	Are you one of those folks on Bomani style that gets into those, you know, those pissing contests about, you know, I pass this, or yo, I pass this.
4746383	4750604	I pass this blindfolded with one hand, and I'm better than Lisu, and da-ba-da-ba-da.
4751905	4753145	No, I'm not one of those.
4753405	4754045	Okay, good, good.
4754125	4757966	I just want to say... If you were, we'd have to shoot you.
4760532	4766735	But yeah, I just want to have my say about Drum Mania V. You want to say something about Drum Mania Guitar Freaks V?
4767456	4767676	Yeah.
4767856	4768376	What's on your mind?
4769377	4773999	Well, yeah, there's some new stuff on Drum Mania V, as everybody's saying.
4774519	4780202	And yeah, they have the, like, sorting it out.
4780302	4784264	They have a folder 80D or something like that.
4784865	4785665	It's really interesting.
4787146	4790507	I haven't seen the game myself yet, so I can't really comment, but okay.
4792528	4796929	I hope to play it someday, but I refuse to go to Roosevelt Golf Land to look at it, because that place is a dump.
4797309	4799970	But, someday.
4801991	4802731	Anything else on your mind?
4803411	4805072	Well, that's kind of it.
4805532	4806512	How's Nightstyle coming?
4806532	4808713	Have you cleared everything yet, or you still got some songs to go?
4809533	4811794	Well, I can do bad one-handed.
4813826	4814826	What are you doing?
4815407	4817388	But I haven't made any double A's yet.
4817888	4819128	Yeah, what do you do with the other hand?
4820209	4820449	What?
4821329	4823010	Well, because you play bag one-handed.
4823050	4824090	What does the other hand do?
4825011	4826331	Well, the scratch, of course.
4826751	4827432	Oh, okay.
4827712	4828292	That's boring.
4829833	4830593	That's two hands.
4830613	4833934	LankyStyle's calling you out saying that that's two hands if you use one for scratching.
4835755	4837356	One hand is actually, you know, just bring the keys.
4837476	4838096	Well, two hands.
4839997	4842698	I know, a lot of people play... Well, like, I play with, like...
4843927	4850070	6 fingers when I play usually because I just use my thumb to hit the first two keys and I use my hand for the rest of them.
4850350	4851510	So I play 6 finger.
4851590	4852851	Is that worth something?
4853771	4854471	Yeah, 6 finger.
4855472	4857753	Is 6 finger 2DX playing worth anything on the forums?
4857773	4861034	Like if I go post, I go, hey guys, I'm a 6 finger 2DX player.
4861254	4862375	Who wants to touch me?
4862675	4864996	I play 1 finger when I watch people pass those in others.
4865416	4866056	No, 1 finger.
4866076	4868977	Guess which finger that is.
4870218	4871538	Now what do you do with the other 9 fingers?
4875953	4881877	Well, the others are busy being held down while the one is gloriously extended in all of my fuck you glory.
4882657	4889042	And then the other one is usually, uh, usually, uh, I don't know, getting money.
4889062	4889462	I don't know.
4890905	4891486	Getting a dollar.
4891786	4892206	Getting a dollar.
4892566	4892907	All right.
4893007	4894708	Put a dollar in the token machine to play something else.
4894969	4896069	We're just messing with you, Siggy.
4896090	4897651	That's cool that you... That's all right.
4897691	4898151	That's all right.
4898191	4899172	We're teasing, you know.
4899192	4900673	That's cool that you're doing the one-handed thing.
4901474	4914706	I think that's kind of a nice way to play it because, you know... It leaves your other hand free for things like Doritos and... Or when you play Keyboard Mania, you're going to want to be able to do as much of that kind of note thing with one hand as possible.
4914966	4915947	That's the one thing I always know.
4915987	4917488	Have you played much Keyboard Mania at all?
4918362	4921324	Well, I have played Keyboard Mania twice back at MGL.
4921524	4921684	Right.
4921964	4924285	And you really have to do the one hand.
4924685	4932870	If you're going to play on the expert levels, you have to be able to do things with one hand up here while you're doing a completely different note pattern down here, just like a normal piano playing, really.
4933310	4934771	So that's one thing I noticed.
4934811	4935071	I don't know.
4936007	4941268	Yeah, the only problem I have with Keyboard Mania is you don't know which fingers to press.
4941728	4949310	They should have that, like which fingers to press, like three as in the middle finger or one for the thumb.
4950310	4953111	Oh, like a guide as to, you know, what... Yeah, it's a guide.
4953971	4958372	Yeah, you kind of have to know piano and they teach you that stuff in piano.
4959204	4961226	But that would be cool if Keyboard Mania would show that stuff.
4961426	4963708	I mean, hey, what a great sales piece.
4963748	4967711	They could sell Keyboard Mania as a piano teaching device, which I guess they did.
4968432	4971354	It did get a limited release, but come on.
4971795	4973997	Who do you know that owns Keyboard Mania for a PC?
4974597	4975418	Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp.
4975438	4976159	No one, that's right.
4978521	4980462	They could mass market that if they wanted to.
4980662	4985987	They should just bring, I don't know, whatever.
4987774	4991257	They should have keyboard mania, like literally typing mania.
4992698	4993659	They have that in Japan.
4994480	4995541	The beat mania, da-da-da.
4997883	4999565	And that's what I said when I played it, da-da-da.
4999745	4999985	Anyway.
5000906	5003089	All right, we're going to let you go, Stiggy, but thanks so much for calling in.
5003129	5003769	Have a good one, okay?
5004270	5004470	Yeah.
5004690	5005251	All right, later.
5005851	5006071	Later.
5006272	5006952	Do you have an outro?
5007933	5008133	No.
5008534	5009214	Okay, bye.
5010342	5010642	Later.
5011203	5015326	I figured since he had this big introduction that he might have something to say as he's leaving, but I guess not.
5015667	5017048	Let's see what our next caller has to say.
5017088	5018068	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
5018849	5020050	Hey, SSJ100, Matt here.
5020170	5021691	Hello, SSJ100, Matt here.
5021751	5022272	What's on your mind?
5023653	5023973	Nothing.
5023993	5028617	I was ready to give my In the Groove review.
5029098	5029538	Oh, goody.
5029698	5030178	Let's hear it.
5030959	5032620	Well, you know, I actually got to try it.
5032660	5034262	It took me months to get it here, but...
5036527	5040851	Anyways, at first, when I first played it about three times, I hated it.
5042472	5047876	I hated the fact of bombs and other stuff, but I figured out you could take those off.
5048677	5051419	You know, actually, when you play it a bunch of times, it's not that bad.
5052440	5054181	Like, you started to warm up to it a little bit?
5054241	5057424	Like, at first, you're like, this sucks, I hate it, but I can't stop playing it, right?
5058585	5058785	Yeah.
5059534	5061355	That's kind of how I felt for a little bit.
5061656	5063197	Well, I was okay with it when I first played.
5063437	5064258	I was just neutral.
5064578	5074025	I was like, this isn't as great as all the people on the internet say it is, but it's not as bad as a lot of people on the internet say it is either, so I'm just going to stop paying attention to what I read on the internet.
5074806	5077328	Yeah.
5077388	5080630	Now I just switch off between that and DDR.
5080850	5083472	So you have both In The Groove and DDR at your local arcade?
5084413	5084613	Yeah.
5084794	5086675	Do you notice if one is more popular than the other?
5088243	5089945	Right now, In the Groove is way more popular.
5090205	5092527	Now I can get on the DDR all the time now.
5093208	5115187	You know what's interesting is that that's kind of the first I've really heard of that, because a lot of arcades I've been to, even when I went and saw In the Groove in New Jersey, like last year when it was being beta tested or whatever, there were more people on DDR Extreme than In the Groove, and I thought that was kind of interesting, because I was like, dude, this is like one of two places in the nation where you can actually play this game, and there's still more people playing DDR.
5116580	5121420	And even when I go to the local bowling alley that has more games, I see more kids on DDR
5122862	5131646	I think the reason for that is that in the groove, despite the fact that it's a technically good game and it's got good music and stuff, it's just ugly.
5132186	5133667	It's a really ugly game.
5134707	5138129	Sorry to the folks that designed the graphics, but it's kind of ugly.
5138189	5142411	DDR has that warm, saccharine, happy, crack vibe, right?
5142731	5147373	Whereas in the groove it has that, I'm industrial and I don't want anything to do with you vibe.
5147413	5148353	I think maybe that's it.
5148393	5149534	It's too Americanized.
5150914	5151275	Maybe.
5151955	5152235	I don't know.
5153666	5154026	I don't know.
5154366	5155967	So that's why I think more people are his own.
5156327	5156987	So what would you say?
5157027	5159848	If he gave In the Groove a score on a scale of 1 to 5, what would you say?
5160408	5164789	Well, when I first played it, I gave it about a 6, and now it's kind of like an 8 or so.
5165050	5165770	On a scale of 1 to 5?
5166230	5166810	That's incredible.
5166830	5167410	1 to 5?
5167550	5169191	I thought you said 1 to 10.
5169271	5169431	Oh, 1 to 10.
5169731	5170551	Well, that's fine.
5171832	5174432	Doesn't matter, but... All right.
5174592	5175113	Well, what else?
5175433	5176473	Anything else you wanted to share with us?
5178230	5181776	Um, not really, just congratulations on the new, uh, place.
5182196	5183178	Thank you, we appreciate it.
5183198	5186683	We hope we can get all our sound working and everything, although I think, I think everything's cool now.
5187965	5188726	And, uh, yep.
5189367	5189667	Alright.
5190128	5191970	Well, thanks, have a good one, thanks for calling in.
5192852	5193132	Later.
5195302	5196583	It's always nice to hear from folks.
5196643	5201545	Okay, what we're going to do, we're going to go into the Orange Lounge cage match right now.
5201605	5204206	If you didn't get through, try back again later.
5204226	5205807	A lot of you guys just keep hammering us.
5205847	5207827	You just call again and again and again until you get through.
5209068	5211749	You can stop doing that because we're not taking any more calls until the cage match is over.
5213410	5216031	But thanks for trying, and we'll get to you guys later.
5216051	5219372	I know a lot of you guys have some things to say, and we'll get into some more of the money news a little later.
5219392	5222794	But we've got some business to settle, such as tonight's cage match.
5226462	5227823	Do you have a Cage Match song tonight, Loki?
5228063	5228363	Oh, goody.
5228823	5229003	Good.
5229023	5231124	Well, let's see.
5231164	5232125	We're starting fresh.
5232845	5236647	So, as a reminder, the way the Cage Match works, we play three songs for you guys.
5237027	5245491	You guys vote on your favorite song, and the winning song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's Bomani Music & More program.
5245871	5247332	Alright, so we're starting fresh.
5247692	5248913	There's no old songs.
5248953	5251694	We're doing three brand new songs this week.
5252054	5253475	And I guess we'll start with my song.
5254946	5255947	I'll do my song first tonight.
5255967	5258569	So you're going to hear them all in their entirety.
5258609	5266194	Remember, the only way you can vote is to actually be in our chat room over at www.orangeloungeradio.com.
5267155	5276942	The song I decided to put in tonight's cage match, when I first heard this song, I was like, this song kind of reminds me of Erotic, but without so much cheese.
5277763	5278924	Like, I don't know, it's not so...
5281061	5282242	In the name of, in the name of love
5364295	5368160	In the name of love In the name of, in the name of love
5406533	5407774	Thank you for watching!
5435861	5436617	Thanks for watching!
5519234	5521395	All right, that was song number one in tonight's cage match.
5521415	5524056	That was Jet Set in the name of love.
5524236	5525757	Let's go around and see what we think.
5525797	5527378	But remember, it's not our vote that counts.
5527418	5527898	It's yours.
5527998	5529219	You've got to be in the chat room to play.
5529379	5530599	www.orangehunter.com.
5531019	5531600	Click on chat.
5531640	5531920	Jamie.
5532600	5533100	It gets a one.
5533701	5535581	It has no originality to it.
5535721	5536522	Nothing innovative.
5537282	5539123	It sounds like the same rehash.
5540023	5540423	No offense.
5540463	5541344	I mean, it was perky.
5542144	5545186	And if I wanted to make myself really happy, I guess I'd listen to it again.
5545726	5548327	But there was no innovation to it.
5549039	5549640	Nothing new.
5550800	5551881	Okay, I'll be nice to three.
5552842	5553682	Alright, Loki.
5554243	5558526	Well, I'll be nice because I don't like Aqua or anything that tries to beat Aqua.
5559226	5575238	I honestly don't like the whole happy, you know, you got one guy that sings really deep and then the girl's like... But it reminded me of sort of like the woman's voice is out of place and the guy sounds like a member of, you know...
5576249	5585035	The Bloodhound Gang, so I just, I didn't really know, it didn't really feel right to me, but because it's trying to be happy, and I'm not happy, it gets a 2.
5586355	5602025	Alright, my thoughts, I think that that song is, you know, it's like you take the Ironic and Aqua songs, which are like so happy to the point of nauseousness, and I think that song kind of strips a lot of that fakeness off, so I think you guys are
5602398	5605779	Just kind of closing yourself off to it, because it is a little bit formulaic, but whatever.
5606779	5611060	I think it's decent, so I give it a 9, because it puts me in a good mood, makes me happy.
5611560	5611801	Angel?
5616502	5617082	Uh, 4.
5618182	5618782	Any reason why?
5620023	5623164	It's kind of, like, awkward, but it's missing something.
5623764	5624284	Alright.
5624824	5625364	Arcadian42?
5625464	5626885	It's heavy.
5627045	5627645	It was bouncy.
5627805	5628405	It was generic.
5628425	5628405	5.
5628825	5630026	Alright.
5630866	5631686	And, LankyStyle?
5633638	5633919	What?
5634599	5635499	What did you think of that song?
5635519	5636180	What are we doing here?
5636940	5637360	Forget it.
5637801	5638161	Alright.
5639282	5639942	Just rank the song.
5639962	5640342	What do you think?
5640422	5640842	One to ten.
5643784	5644084	Six.
5646085	5646486	Alright.
5647666	5648647	Let's move on.
5648727	5650268	Song number two is Jamie's Pick.
5650308	5651769	What did you pick for us tonight, Jamie?
5652649	5655331	I've been wanting to put this in like a month ago, but I kept winning.
5656331	5657832	It's Gorillaz, Feel Good Inc.
5658092	5659613	I know it's been playing on the radio, but...
5660515	5663397	I really, really like this song a whole bunch.
5663657	5666518	I really like everything they've been doing with music.
5666558	5667399	It's been innovative.
5667439	5667959	It's been new.
5667979	5671461	It's been taking the whole pop genre in a different direction.
5672481	5674603	And this one just has a really sexy bass line, too.
5674723	5676043	So I want that this ends.
5677464	5677764	All right.
5678164	5678485	Here it is.
5678525	5680666	Song number two, Gorillaz, Feel Good Inc.
5680906	5681126	Enjoy.
5748950	5750933	Thanks for watching!
5802253	5802933	S, Actdeft,
5831420	5832882	Thank you for watching!
5906109	5909351	Song number two there, Gorillaz with Feel Good Inc.
5909671	5910651	How'd you guys feel?
5910671	5912953	Did that make you feel good or make you feel sick?
5913053	5914133	Let's see, DarkSakura.
5914534	5917155	I've been listening to this song for two months and haven't gotten sick of it yet.
5917735	5919816	So, uh, it gets a ten automatically.
5919856	5921737	The whole album gets a fifty million.
5921838	5922478	So, yeah.
5923018	5924139	Buy Demon Days when it comes out.
5925239	5925540	Loki.
5931283	5931983	I had no mic.
5933164	5935005	Um, no, it has a good bass line.
5935465	5935505	Um,
5936425	5938826	I don't know, it's just, it's okay.
5939487	5940407	I mean, I like Gorillaz.
5941087	5942128	I love their older stuff.
5942968	5947350	It's just, there's parts of the song I didn't like, and other parts are okay.
5947530	5952633	So it just gets like a 7 or 8-ish, you know, 8 I guess.
5954714	5958037	Um, that song is kind of like a big cake to me.
5958457	5960698	Like you've got frost, like it's a multi-layered cake.
5960719	5966042	You've got this really like nice frosting, and then there's like really sweet stuff in the middle, like the fruit stuff in the middle.
5966062	5967083	What kind of frosting are we talking about?
5967323	5969124	Like, strawberry frosting.
5969345	5969485	Oh!
5970205	5970866	Oh, oh.
5971266	5972727	You had me going with frosting.
5972747	5973147	Okay, okay.
5973187	5973808	Cream cheese.
5974008	5975149	How about chocolate frosting?
5975709	5976329	Chocolate frosting?
5976390	5977370	How did I get that point?
5977510	5980072	And then like in the middle is like, I don't know, like extra chocolate.
5980092	5980332	I don't know.
5980352	5981052	So it's really sweet.
5981092	5984714	My point is, it's really sweet, like, but the rest of it's kind of cake.
5984754	5985275	It's just cake.
5985735	5991438	You know, like, because that song is kind of like three things combined, it feels like to me, like there's different elements of it.
5991518	5996541	Or it's like you got a good cake and then they throw in that stupid custard filling and it's like, oh, goddamn!
5996881	5997421	That's more like it.
5997441	5998582	Why did you ruin a good cake?
5998622	6006624	That's kind of like it, because like there's two elements to that song I really, like especially one, like the slow parts of the song, I really, really, really like.
6006644	6007845	The slow parts are very blur.
6008465	6010005	Yeah, see I like blur, I think that's why.
6010246	6012726	But then like the De La Soul stuff, that's like the custard.
6012926	6013947	I'm not, I'm not dead on it.
6013967	6015427	See, that's what, I like the opposite.
6015547	6019149	I like the De La Soul stuff, but I hated the slow parts.
6019409	6021009	Well, then I feel the opposite.
6021229	6022670	But the score is still the same, I give it an 8.
6023070	6023270	Angel.
6024861	6028984	Yeah, I look good as well, so I will give it an 8.
6029824	6030284	Alright.
6030324	6034607	Not just because I'm copying you, but not really because I'm copying you, but... Just because you're copying us.
6034647	6035047	Arcadian.
6035147	6035507	Okay.
6037529	6039250	I like Boston Cream Pie.
6039630	6039810	Good.
6040791	6041231	Yeah!
6041451	6043412	Boston Cream Pie is cake with custard.
6043893	6044653	Yeah, so it's good.
6045193	6046334	And Y'all Can Realize Rock 2.
6046874	6046334	9.
6048095	6049996	Alright, uh, LankyStyle.
6050837	6050917	Um...
6052345	6056929	I don't think it makes me feel good, it makes me feel pretty ink, you know, incorporated.
6058190	6064155	No, you know what, I hate gorillas, like, they're always the source of any problem in like a sci-fi story.
6065015	6066416	Gorillas are monkeys too, right?
6066636	6071440	No, those are, you're thinking of monkeys are not gorillas.
6072701	6073962	They're apes, they're simians, right?
6073982	6075143	The monkeys had Mickey Dolenz!
6077005	6078306	And Davy Jones.
6078366	6079206	Exactly, Bradley.
6079487	6081028	However, Congo was a bad movie.
6082586	6085407	Gorillas learn sign language and talk to us.
6085427	6087707	Gorillas are smart, except for QD.
6087847	6089868	And apparently they can sing through a megaphone.
6091988	6098090	And they also, you know, take women and run up the Empire Stability.
6098210	6099871	They run them up the Empire Stability.
6099891	6103792	Man, that is... Will you please give the song a rating so we can finish this goddamn segment?
6103812	6105272	Okay, hold on, a little back...
6106142	6110384	I think this is the only good song on the new album.
6110485	6112866	I've listened to the whole thing and I'm not impressed.
6112906	6116068	The last album was much better in my opinion.
6116688	6117769	But it's still a good song.
6117789	6119469	Like I said, it's the best song on the album.
6119710	6121170	So it gets, for me, an 8.
6122351	6123792	But it's going to get old for me really quick.
6123812	6126353	I've already listened to it like four times and I'm still kind of like, hmm.
6126893	6129515	I did like the slow parts better than the rest of it.
6129615	6130155	I prefer blur.
6132695	6135258	Alright, let's get into the last song of tonight's cage match.
6135438	6136239	Loki, what'd you pick?
6137840	6140082	Well, I hope this is what's on this track here.
6145207	6151894	Well, hopefully this is, oh my god, I'm saying hopefully, a Paul Terry track.
6151994	6157559	Hopefully this is the song from the Midnight Tune 2 soundtrack.
6159764	6161225	Wangan Midnight Maximum 2 and 2.
6161685	6162326	Yeah, that song.
6162626	6163747	Or that CD.
6163887	6165308	Anyway, it's an awesome game.
6165388	6169631	It's sort of an Initial D-ish type thing.
6169731	6171112	It's got pretty cool music in it.
6171452	6172733	But then there's Paul Terry.
6173233	6176636	And Paul Terry, honestly, I hate Paul Terry.
6176776	6177176	I hate her.
6177216	6180959	But I think it's the Paul Terry-Nyoki combo that I hate.
6181199	6183040	It's Paul Terry-Nyoki that is bad.
6183060	6186182	Paul Terry, other artists, that's okay.
6186383	6188244	And this is a song that she sings in.
6189784	6191585	Okay, I don't remember the original artist.
6192806	6194908	It's Yuzo Koshiro, featuring Politary.
6194928	6201552	Okay, anyway, the guy that did music for Actraiser, and so this is the song, Nothing Can Live Forever.
6202072	6206134	Yuzo Koshiro, featuring Politary, Nothing Can Live Forever, song number three.
6206154	6207755	I am crossing my fingers, I hope this is the right studio.
6207775	6208456	Enjoy, me too.
6214259	6215700	The time has come to say
6229462	6230923	Thank you for watching
6260496	6261897	I'm approaching my truth.
6395270	6397174	Thanks for watching!
6427333	6434237	Thanks for watching!
6482130	6483084	Thanks for watching!
6553484	6555786	Okay, that was song number three in tonight's cage match.
6555846	6561970	That was Yuzo Koshiro featuring Paula Terry with Nothing Can Live Forever.
6562010	6565652	Will that song live forever in your memory or is it going to die right now?
6565732	6566072	Jamie?
6569054	6571696	I don't like Paula Terry because she can't hold a key to save her life.
6573337	6574318	It was still pretty good.
6574358	6576179	I mean, it's too trance for my taste.
6577220	6579982	But overall, it presented...
6581164	6584045	It presented an image, that's all I can say.
6584085	6592049	I like music that presents a picture, and that one I definitely got a feeling from, so it gets an 8 from me.
6593650	6604515	You know, the song, I like the beginning part with her sort of singing over it, because it's kind of like, you know, it kind of builds you up for it, but then the song kind of is like...
6604949	6606109	I don't know, it's an okay song.
6606269	6611171	It's what I had because I haven't cut down certain other songs that I need to be submitting to the cage match.
6611711	6613612	But, uh, so it gets an 8.
6613652	6618553	That's the best I'm gonna give it because... But, you gotta check out the whole soundtrack, it's really cool.
6620514	6623775	Um, I like the first minute, and then the other four I fell asleep.
6624335	6624595	I give it a 6.
6625575	6625855	Angel.
6628116	6631437	It was pretty cool, um, I'll be nice and give it a 7.
6632077	6633918	Because I don't know what else to give it, whatever.
6635350	6635930	Arcadian.
6637491	6638091	It was alright.
6639231	6640352	I wasn't all that impressed.
6640392	6642232	I haven't listened to the soundtrack yet.
6642672	6643593	But I'll give it a 6.
6644433	6645093	Lanky Style.
6646053	6651335	I'm one of the weird people who believes that Paul Terry can only do good when she's coupled with a Balani artist.
6651695	6656017	So, I'm not hugely a big fan of this song.
6656237	6659098	The rest, pretty much the rest of that soundtrack is awesome.
6659138	6661098	Just one kind of video of the team.
6661118	6662339	So, I'm going with that.
6662359	6662499	Just
6664764	6665884	Alright, let's recap.
6665944	6668405	It's about time to vote, but first let's recap.
6668485	6672606	Remember, you're going to send a private message to Sky with your vote, but here are the songs you can vote for tonight.
6672666	6676087	Song number one is Jet Set, In the Name of Love.
6679908	6687770	And song number two you can vote for tonight is Gorillaz with Feel Good Inc.
6688671	6689951	It's my chocolate attack.
6697573	6701595	And song number three you can vote for tonight is Yozo Koshiro.
6702435	6703616	Did I get that right this time?
6703976	6704636	It's close enough.
6704856	6705376	Close enough.
6705677	6706697	Featuring Paul and Terry.
6706757	6707517	I did that from memory.
6708137	6709098	Yozo Koshiro.
6709118	6709378	Sorry.
6709818	6711879	Featuring Paul and Terry with Nothing Can Live Forever.
6724560	6726862	Place vote now.
6727002	6729883	Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.
6729903	6732645	Song number one, song number two, song number three.
6732665	6734266	Wait, and a surprise fourth song.
6735067	6736107	No.
6736728	6737588	Sky the game.
6737688	6738709	No twist here, sorry.
6739309	6744052	All right, this is the part of the show where I would always ask, Loki, what's going on in the sim scene?
6744153	6747615	I don't know if you've been keeping tabs on what's going on, but what's up, Loki?
6750430	6751191	Not a much.
6752592	6754853	Honestly, really nothing going on.
6755654	6758816	There's only a couple things I'd like to mention.
6760217	6767182	First off, as far as simpacks being released, not really too much this week.
6767943	6775588	However, there's this wonderful site that someone created because, I don't know if you remember, DDRAmerica.com, the old Belmonte Torrent site...
6777216	6777797	Alt-Control-Delete.com
6796393	6804359	BitTorrentTracker, and you've got some of the poppin' music soundtracks, and some 2DX.
6804639	6806180	It's mainly soundtrack rips right now.
6807401	6810063	So, I guess that's something worth mentioning.
6811564	6813706	Chatroom is yelling, BMS contest.
6814106	6817649	And I guess this is something I think... Oh, yeah, but my cell's BMS contest.
6817669	6818789	They have that going on right now.
6820991	6821852	You sound excited.
6823004	6824144	I mean, come on now, folks.
6824204	6828406	I mean, really, I guess it could be cool.
6829026	6840651	I mean, but I just, you know, with the Japanese doing BMS files, I don't think USF is just going to be up to par with it.
6840731	6844092	I'm sorry, the Japanese have, like, got you beat by a lot.
6845758	6847019	That's my opinion on this stuff.
6847059	6855649	I mean, you play Japanese BMS files and you're like, holy crap, this stuff could have been in Beatmania or in 2DX or something.
6855689	6857471	It's just really high quality stuff.
6857762	6862203	Well, also there's more of a team mentality from what I understand.
6862483	6864384	It's set up like a professional production crew.
6864464	6873267	I bet if more of the American producers of the BMS files got together and put the same kind of effort into it, they could come up with a quality product.
6873287	6873947	It's like a food mix.
6874127	6877208	A food mix is a perfect example of production quality.
6877648	6879328	I mean, that's just top-notch stuff right there.
6879548	6885110	You could honestly, if they had the permission, you could release a DDR mix of all food mix stuff, and it would...
6886161	6887722	You wouldn't have to really change anything to it.
6887842	6888862	It would look great.
6889683	6895525	And that's what's really cool about... And BMS stuff is exactly the same.
6895585	6897566	They do all their remixing stuff on there.
6898026	6902288	The production quality is incredibly awesome.
6902448	6912212	And even with stuff they only have movie files playing in the background, it's all just stop motion with bitmaps and JPEGs and stuff.
6912392	6913713	And it still looks incredible.
6913893	6914193	It's just...
6915296	6916337	I don't even know how to describe it.
6916397	6916877	It's awesome.
6916917	6920320	This is like where Onuken and stuff got its start, is with BMS files.
6921100	6924503	And you really... I'm sorry, the U.S.
6924563	6925684	is not going to be able to come close.
6926064	6933870	They can try, but I already have high standards for BMS files, and I'm afraid, like most everything else that the U.S.
6933950	6935491	does as far as sim files go...
6936058	6937119	I'm gonna be disappointed.
6937659	6942303	But, hey, you know, I'd like to still see what comes of this because it'll be interesting.
6942323	6945486	There's gotta be at least one quality file that comes with it.
6945526	6949049	Oh yeah, I'm sure there's gonna be some good stuff, but there's gonna be some crap stuff too.
6949209	6952352	I don't have the patience to make a StepMania file, let alone a BMS file.
6952652	6955935	You know, I bet the three of us could get together and do a really good...
6956758	6957359	BMS.
6958220	6961704	There's better things we could spend our time doing, like eating.
6961944	6962264	Sleeping.
6962925	6963385	Sleeping.
6965528	6966268	Yeah, yeah.
6966949	6968691	Or working on our station or something.
6968751	6969572	Doing promos.
6971094	6971394	All right.
6971654	6972315	We don't do those.
6974158	6977801	But yeah, so there's nothing really going on as far as that item is concerned.
6980744	6981184	What else?
6981544	6984947	Oh, yeah, there's some more boss files released by DJ Pato.
6985568	6989911	Who, like most other people, call themselves DJ, is not a DJ.
6990792	6993314	And boss files are retarded, I like to mention.
6995396	6997418	For those who don't know what boss files are, they're incredibly hard...
7000014	7005817	and DWIs that are basically Beatmania for Stepmania, which is just crap.
7006097	7007938	It's crap, it's crap, it's crap.
7008358	7008958	Don't play them.
7009919	7018723	Yeah, man, that's like the number one problem with Stepmania files out there on the internet is they're all trying to be Beatmania because nobody plays Stepmania with an actual dance pad.
7018743	7026587	They're all using their fingers, and when they AAA songs, they're taking screen gaps of it and posting how big their internet penis is because they AAA'd a song with their fingers on a dance game.
7028311	7031474	And then they complain because a lot of the ten-footers and stuff are too easy.
7031494	7033536	Well, yeah, because you're using your fingers, dumbass.
7033636	7034376	Try using your feet.
7036118	7036618	Exactly.
7037039	7037279	Anyway.
7038980	7040642	Alright, you guys want to hear who won tonight's cage match?
7041322	7041663	Sure!
7042640	7053068	All right, you know what's interesting is that last week I think we had the most number of votes I've ever seen in a cage match in recent memory, and this week we have some of the least number of votes in a cage match in recent memory, so I don't know what's up.
7053708	7054148	Family guy.
7054489	7054729	Huh?
7055049	7055509	Family guy.
7055709	7056790	Is it because of family guy?
7057090	7058371	Come on, people.
7058491	7060273	It was leaked to the internet like two weeks ago.
7060293	7062234	I know, I've had it on my PC all week.
7063135	7066517	You can get a torrent later or stop being cheap and buy a TiVo.
7066857	7068719	We are far more important than that damn show.
7068739	7070480	They'll just cancel it again, and you'll be sad.
7071540	7073121	Oh man, that show's awesome.
7073342	7075203	But our show's awesomer.
7075403	7076424	That's right, we're awesomer.
7076965	7084491	Alright, anyway, tonight's cage match winner is... In the name... Not in the name of love, my bad.
7084531	7085792	Nothing can live forever.
7085812	7086592	Oh my god.
7087753	7089455	I thought gorillas would have won the game.
7089495	7091076	Yuzo Koshiro.
7092992	7101135	I don't know, maybe on another night where everybody was voting, but tonight we only had... Oh my god, I was expecting this was a filler song until I picked a good one.
7101415	7102235	Eh, it always works that way.
7102255	7106957	Just wait until after we get back from E3 and the Demon Days album is actually released so I can put that one song in.
7107317	7109617	Because I can't put it in before the album's out.
7110618	7111498	Out of support for the band.
7112781	7114822	I have to say it wasn't a bad song.
7115663	7117283	You could play it.
7118024	7119864	I will actually go ahead and say it was a bad song.
7123086	7124166	I could, but I won't.
7124186	7126287	I know right away it was a bad song.
7126307	7127268	That's why I put it in.
7128848	7131470	I can't see how you could call my song repetitive and then put that in.
7132210	7133631	I could play it, but I won't.
7133891	7135411	Out of respect for my favorite band.
7137032	7137572	I could play it.
7138873	7139373	I'm teasing.
7139873	7140113	Anyway,
7142130	7142530	Let's see.
7143111	7143791	What are we going to do now?
7143952	7146834	Actually, I want to do the DDR Freak Post of the Week.
7146854	7149176	Because this is exciting.
7149216	7154840	By the way, DDR Freak does run our Rewinds every Friday night over on The Freak.
7155301	7156782	So you guys should check that out.
7157623	7163207	If you ever miss part of this show, so if you must skip us and go watch Family Guy...
7164808	7168010	I suppose you could catch up with us on Friday night over on DDR Free.
7168170	7171732	We're on the same week now, so tonight's show you will hear this Friday.
7171752	7172833	You don't have to wait a week anymore.
7173153	7177215	Granted, folks, I mean, you could download this DVD quality on the internet.
7177596	7178496	It's on my PSP.
7178696	7179977	We watched it yesterday.
7179997	7181778	Yes, I watched it on Loki's PSP already.
7181838	7184760	Okay, and granted, it was very funny.
7185580	7187982	It's still the same level of funny as it used to be.
7188002	7193725	Oh, yeah, it's really funny, and I highly recommend it, but because it's against our show, I'm sorry, but you can't go.
7195094	7195774	Exactly, folks.
7195814	7196535	They'll rerun it.
7197075	7198176	Yeah, they'll rerun it.
7198636	7200097	You can get it on BitTorrent.
7200417	7202378	You can get it TiVo, stopping cheap.
7202538	7203639	Set your VCR.
7205900	7208522	Or tape us, I suppose, but it's a little harder to tape the internet.
7208622	7212844	Or buy Satellite and, you know, watch it East Coast time.
7212864	7213224	There you go.
7213304	7215326	There you go, because East Coast people saw it before our show was on.
7215486	7215866	Exactly.
7216086	7219228	Anyway, let's get to the DDR Freak Post of the Week.
7222072	7227216	A bunch of crazies over there on DDR Freak.
7227396	7227896	No, I'm kidding.
7228476	7230037	There's some really great people on DDR Freak.
7230057	7233200	But once in a while, you get a few loonies that make very interesting posts.
7233520	7236522	And tonight's DDR Freak Post of the Week was suggested to me by one of our chatters.
7236982	7240965	I want to say it was LXLDubes that suggested this one.
7241185	7243466	And if it wasn't you and it was somebody else, I apologize to that person.
7243587	7244067	I think it was him.
7246048	7246248	What?
7247289	7247369	Oh.
7247829	7250251	Hey, Post of the Week, this is not TurboGrafx segment.
7250271	7251292	This is DDR Freak Post of the Week.
7251312	7251492	Sorry.
7253929	7254610	Subject.
7255270	7256571	The subject for this post.
7257392	7259094	DDR Fairy Tales.
7259794	7263618	You know, I came so close to locking that damn thread, and then I thought, nah.
7263938	7264438	Here it is.
7265079	7265799	Here's the post.
7266400	7268722	I just thought this would be a funny idea.
7269382	7274727	Try to make a random fairy tale out of as many DDR song titles as possible.
7275147	7275648	Good luck.
7276989	7280252	Well, okay, that post isn't that great, but let's see some of the replies.
7282419	7288625	Once upon a time, in the kingdom of Max 300, there was a noble prince named Jam Jam Reggae.
7290967	7293289	Okay, Yam Yam Ragu.
7294210	7295752	What the hell was that?
7296192	7298674	I don't know anybody named Jam Jam Reggae, do you?
7299315	7300456	Makes no sense whatsoever.
7302918	7303539	Uh, let's see.
7304481	7315308	Once upon a time, a prince upon a star, which is a Beatmania song, not a DDR song, visited the Queens, Jamaica, again, Beatmania, not DDR, where he met a man named Gamble.
7315388	7321311	If you want to get technical, you know, they were in a club mix, whatever.
7321892	7323293	Again, he met a man named Gamble.
7323433	7324773	But these songs weren't made famous.
7325794	7326955	They were first in Beatmania.
7326975	7327255	Shut up.
7327851	7331153	This man had a lovely senorita named Nori Nori Nori.
7331553	7336156	Then they all died because they got ran over by a cowgirl going maximum overdrive.
7336256	7336696	The end.
7339518	7344581	Honestly, these share the same place in my heart as with those three-word stories.
7346522	7352046	There was one that went on for like a whole page, and if you think I'm reading it, you're freaking crazy.
7353226	7354187	I'll read one more here.
7355128	7355528	Let's see.
7359362	7363325	Yeah, this was Alex L. Dubes that recommended it because he made a post in here.
7363345	7365807	It says, DDR fairy tales, ooh, ooh, let me try.
7366087	7368189	There once was a village of people who had no life.
7368229	7370651	And what a surprise, there was a DDR machine in the village.
7373092	7373793	That one's good.
7374493	7376835	You know what we need to actually do instead of the fairy tales?
7376875	7378036	We need DDR limericks.
7378957	7379637	Dirty ones.
7380017	7381338	Dirty DDR limericks?
7381739	7381959	Yeah.
7381979	7382059	Yeah.
7382887	7384788	Well, this one starts out, it might sound dirty.
7384808	7386450	Here's the last one I'm going to read.
7386890	7389652	Once upon a time, there was a man named Max, period.
7390212	7392374	He went up to a La Senorita.
7392754	7394395	Buenos dias, he yelled.
7397177	7399819	I think buenos dias should be a DDR song.
7400780	7401820	Buenos dias!
7404803	7405503	Oh my god.
7405863	7410006	They needed a Spanish version of Max.
7410607	7410867	What?
7411007	7412448	They needed a Spanish version of Max.
7416706	7417147	I'm sorry.
7417427	7418588	He went up to a La Senorita.
7418628	7419849	Buenos dias, he yelled.
7420209	7421811	He then offered her some candy.
7422551	7426314	All of a sudden, in a wild rush, she began to scream, waka laka.
7426855	7428356	Max yelled, don't break down.
7428816	7430357	Wait a minute, she screamed.
7430598	7431799	You have broken my heart.
7432359	7435081	He then began to feel like he hit a dead end.
7435562	7438084	You've been cheating on me, huh, Max, period, she screamed.
7438786	7440747	I like to share my love, he responded.
7441107	7442448	Nothing gonna stop, he added.
7442889	7444670	She then said, make love to me.
7445290	7447331	The reflex took over and they banged.
7447651	7448732	The end of the century.
7450773	7451734	Okay, that one's good.
7451814	7452394	That one's good.
7453495	7455716	That one wins a lack of angst for me.
7458478	7460719	The reflex took over and, well, they banged.
7461840	7462540	Buenos dias!
7463281	7464462	Buenos dias!
7471836	7474096	I love the way people write on DDR free.
7474496	7476857	The reflex took over and, you know, they banged.
7480778	7481578	Did she bang?
7483179	7487900	Comment from our chat room and VXJasonXV really wants me to read this because he's posted it three times.
7488420	7493242	I thought it was a fairy tale, not a retardation and bastardization of song titles.
7494402	7495683	Come on, Jason.
7495723	7496583	Buenos dias.
7498460	7500480	Fairy Tailgate because it's a song.
7503481	7504201	Let's go to break.
7507462	7509422	In this break, we're going to hear... You know what?
7509482	7512102	Now that I've said... Oh, wait.
7513003	7514343	We've got to talk about something.
7514363	7514883	Alright, what?
7515723	7518764	Remember that we posted something about Karaoke Revolution?
7519444	7521104	Alright, what do you want to say about Karaoke Revolution?
7521844	7524164	There's that song from Dirty Dancing in it.
7524585	7526665	And I'm scared because there's a Karaoke Revolution 4.
7527762	7528082	The end.
7557395	7558737	Buenos dias, Max 300.
7558797	7560459	Buenos dias, El Bimbo.
7560780	7562422	We'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge.
7587368	7588408	Thanks for watching!
7622000	7623320	Thanks for watching!
7662798	7663861	Thanks for watching!
7743703	7744612	Now this is...
7776531	7777892	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
7813488	7813908	Check it out.
7862722	7867816	Why do you cry when you're happy It's just something special
7939813	7944614	From StepSquad to OrangeLounge, this PDR sucks!
7944994	7949676	Holler!
7950616	7960358	P-T-P-O Hi, we're back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 140 in progress.
7961139	7965720	And we're going to get into the FUs of the week relatively shortly, but first... Cool.
7966607	7966988	SILENT HILL Um...
7984694	7988516	Really, my updates are just from over the week.
7989136	7991538	The basic story, of course, has been out on the web for some time.
7992318	7993398	They're in pre-production now.
7994979	7997420	For the Silent Hill movie, correct?
7997521	8000702	So far, cast is Radha Mitchell from Finding Neverland.
8001042	8004304	Sean Bean is in it as her character's husband.
8006165	8008506	For Lord of the Rings fans, he was Boromir.
8009387	8013609	And then somebody named Jodell Ferlin as the daughter in the movie.
8014921	8020684	But there's a... They were saying in this one article, and I'll link it in the chat room in just a moment.
8022625	8031469	They had the production cost, I think it's... It's expected to top $25,000 per day during the shoot.
8032129	8035491	So it's going to be, of course, several million dollars to produce this movie.
8035511	8036511	They've got big hopes for it.
8037772	8039193	There are pictures out on the net...
8040106	8044108	Trying to find the link I had that had like 60 some odd pre-production pictures.
8044128	8047830	There actually is a link on OrangeScienceRadio.com and the story we ran earlier this week has a link to it.
8048251	8049631	If it's still valid, which I think it is.
8050092	8050932	Actually, I do believe it is.
8051913	8055274	But I'm also going to copy this article for the chat room.
8055375	8056075	It's really good.
8057696	8062418	And it's talking about actually the town that they're filming it in and how the people are reacting to it.
8064259	8064840	Very cool.
8065340	8065700	There it is.
8065820	8067641	I'm looking forward to that movie very much.
8067841	8068302	It should be...
8070606	8072727	I'm hoping that they stay loyal to the games.
8073128	8076129	If they stay loyal to the games, it'll be so cool.
8077110	8079711	But if they try to do the Resident Evil thing, it's going to suck.
8080091	8083593	So I really hope they don't turn it into like zombie horror action film.
8085414	8087596	But, you know, kind of that subtle mess with your mind.
8087676	8091198	I think it's going to stay with the way the games are, honestly.
8091758	8093299	I'm hopeful from the pictures.
8093459	8093819	I'm very hopeful.
8093839	8095540	It doesn't seem like it's exactly the same.
8095660	8099282	Because you know how in the games everybody is linked to the whole...
8104250	8111593	This one seems almost like it would be an innocent bystander just caught up in what's going on, from what I can tell.
8112294	8112974	It's looking pretty cool.
8114175	8115275	I'm hoping it comes out soon.
8115295	8117476	I know it's not out until next year, but you never know what might happen.
8118237	8118657	I need this.
8119678	8122380	Alright, it's time for the FUs of the week, boys and girls.
8122440	8128464	If you want to send in an FU of the week, send your private message to Sky in the chat room with whatever you want to give an FU to.
8128504	8131666	Please keep them short, as we've got a lot of people that probably want to get their FUs in.
8132106	8134808	If your FU goes on and on and on, you will get cut off!
8135649	8136249	Just like that.
8136669	8138090	We don't have to read your FU anyway.
8139091	8141112	But we will, because we know you're angsty like us.
8141473	8145015	So DarkSakura, why is it that we do the FUs of the week every single week?
8146936	8148177	Because Jamie can't have chocolate.
8165728	8169911	Fuck you to car accidents and all the shit that's happened in my car, god damn it.
8170731	8174093	You know, I loved my CD player even though it was a piece of shit.
8174853	8177735	And I loved my car even though it's also a piece of shit.
8178590	8180931	But I didn't need to be in the goddamn accident.
8181171	8187712	I certainly am tired of not being able to walk up a damn flight of stairs because my hip hurts like in excruciating pain.
8187732	8191413	This is after Vicodin and Flexerol, so fuck the whole thing.
8191453	8192793	This is what I'm angsty about.
8193534	8199835	And also, I hate taking the medication anyway because it makes my head feel all funny.
8200095	8203776	And when my head feels funny, I tend to say weird things and tend to just go off on people.
8204235	8223475	and I went off on people at work and that's not good so I ended up going home because I went off on people um just I hate feeling like this I hate the crap that's happening in my car and honestly I wish that someone would just run into my car with a semi so that their insurance would buy me a brand new fucking car
8224565	8228526	Also, F you to my apartment complex and the stupid bitch that manages it.
8228886	8234828	She doesn't do her job for shit and keeps letting these wannabe thug gangsters move in next door.
8235489	8237309	And it's no longer a safe place to live.
8237389	8244372	I also fucking hate the stupid cost of houses in this state, especially in Sacramento.
8244572	8246432	The Bay Area, of course, is a lot more expensive.
8246953	8248873	But it's hard to find a house for under $350,000.
8249393	8254155	And if we have to move out to Yuba City to freaking have a house
8254730	8262052	that is worth a damn and not have to, you know, pay everything for the rest of our lives to have this house, then so be it.
8262092	8269235	You know, I'll put up with the extra drive, but I did find a cute house, though, but it's small and they want a bunch for it.
8269935	8271395	It's just a nightmare, you know.
8272516	8274116	I fucking hate growing up now.
8274876	8276597	Isn't this going to be nice to have a house?
8277397	8280898	Oh, life's going to suck when you grow up, when you grow up, when you grow up.
8283019	8283099	Ugh.
8286327	8293833	All of you kids in the chatroom, you have no right to complain about living with your parents because you don't have to pay for shit.
8294953	8299417	If I hear you bitching one more time, I'm going to come to your house and slap you upside the head.
8299657	8302700	Unless you aren't paying the mortgage by yourself, then you can't bitch.
8302900	8303681	Or pay rent.
8304902	8307183	And even then, you can move out when you're fucking 18.
8308308	8310969	Although I don't recommend it, live with your parents as long as you can.
8311049	8313070	Milk them for every cent they're worth.
8313830	8316411	Because it's such when you have to do it all by yourself.
8317812	8318152	I'm done.
8319593	8320073	Loki.
8324795	8326516	Chocolate good.
8328316	8328937	No, but anyways.
8329317	8330397	Now the chocolate's gone.
8332558	8333679	I need more chocolate.
8333899	8334379	Now.
8334739	8335059	That.
8335539	8335840	Anyways.
8337395	8345266	No, I was, um, I'm very pissed off at the fact of just my weekends being, in general, like, too busy for me.
8345306	8348271	I don't even get a chance to actually, like, relax during the whole weekend.
8349673	8350534	No other peanut butter cups.
8350694	8351695	I hate peanut butter cups.
8352076	8353418	I like expensive chocolates.
8357340	8359802	I like non-expensive chocolates that used to be expensive.
8360202	8364946	Anyways, um... So fuck you to goddamn weekends being too damn long.
8365286	8371011	And fuck you to having to drive... Just... Stressful, okay?
8373192	8373653	Thank you!
8374754	8375454	I get more chocolates.
8376475	8377696	Um... Anyways...
8378086	8381088	Fuck you to bad drivers, because they're everywhere.
8381728	8382609	Everywhere, everywhere.
8382669	8389514	I was coming home from dropping off Rob yesterday, and this guy zips past me at like 50 miles an hour faster than where I'm going.
8389754	8392836	Granted, I'm going about 75 on the freeway.
8393176	8396598	He's just all... No, I was in the car when that happened.
8396718	8397599	That guy was crazy.
8397839	8399340	Yeah, I don't even know what that was.
8399560	8400841	I mean, that was just nuts.
8402338	8406280	People, honestly, I mean, I see, I'm going like, you know, 75 or something.
8406340	8411522	I consider that pretty, you know, that's some pretty good speeding right there.
8411542	8414924	I mean, you don't want to go crazy because, you know, there's a lot of cars out there.
8415004	8416985	But there's people that are zooming past me, you know.
8417560	8431761	Just like, nothing, you know, I don't understand why everyone's in such a hurry nowadays, and it was funny though, today, one person did just like the same thing, you know, zoomed right past me, and then a cop car zoomed right past me and pulled the sucker over.
8432522	8433143	Oh, that was great.
8434464	8443354	Um, then, um, what was that, I was gonna say, um, fuck you to, uh, Live365 for not giving me more, uh, free crap.
8443875	8447259	I like free crap, and all I got was a stupid t-shirt that I'm probably not gonna wear.
8448041	8449643	Last year we had a lot more free crap.
8449884	8451346	We got a lot more free crap last year.
8451386	8453429	I was very disappointed at the lack of free crap this year.
8453449	8457074	I'm just like, I'm trying to figure out why, what exactly cost the $20.
8457755	8459177	What am I getting for this $20?
8459217	8459938	That's what I want to know.
8459978	8464485	You got to see that girl sing those dirty ass lyrics about that guy being up all in her.
8466010	8470233	Yeah, but I wasn't that guy all up in her, so it wasn't really, you know, worth the $20.
8470293	8472275	That's what I'm trying to say.
8472295	8477238	If you'd gotten a chance to go up all in her, and she wrote that song about you, would it have been worth the $20?
8477278	8478479	That would have been worth the $20.
8479500	8480420	I got two things.
8480741	8482442	One, I've got a bunch of free crap coming.
8482462	8483643	You can have it free.
8483843	8486985	I'll drop it in the toilet or something if you want.
8487005	8487806	Two, hold on, two.
8488328	8493913	You guys have to pay to go to the awards, even though you are on the ballot, so to speak.
8494273	8496294	Let's play a fun game, LankyStyle.
8496535	8498977	Let's play how much was each ticket.
8499017	8504021	No, better yet, let's play how much did it cost for all three of us to go to the awards ceremony.
8504501	8505202	Guess now.
8505222	8505202	$100.
8505582	8505662	Less.
8509099	8509539	75.
8509239	8509539	Less.
8510019	8510740	Well, this is no fun.
8510780	8511460	He's guessing high.
8512120	8513100	I'm including gas.
8513380	8513741	Okay.
8513761	8513881	No, no.
8513921	8514561	Oh, well, shit.
8514601	8515201	If you're including gas.
8515221	8515881	Okay, just the tickets?
8515901	8516521	Just the tickets.
8516541	8517062	Tickets alone.
8517082	8517062	60.
8518022	8518362	Bingo.
8518382	8518362	$60.
8518462	8519322	Because you said 20.
8519682	8520183	I got that.
8520203	8520483	Oh, sorry.
8520923	8521783	I forgot you knew math.
8522883	8523884	Anyways.
8524004	8531646	Also, fuck you to the Embassy Suites Hotel having their stupid... Okay, now their wireless...
8532057	8536100	Internet there or whatever that was that I was trying to jump onto with my PSP.
8536520	8539742	It was, you know, password free, but it wasn't letting me connect for some reason.
8539782	8540622	That pissed me off.
8540723	8542083	Damn those protected internets.
8542103	8550789	Because I wanted to jump onto the chat room that was in the Live365 and write dirty stuff, but I couldn't do that, so that made me sad.
8552870	8557053	And then fuck you to Oakland for sucking, for being really ghetto.
8557713	8558514	I hate Oakland.
8559544	8566609	And, uh, um, also, fuck you to Comcast for taking a week to fix my internet.
8567729	8568090	You suck.
8568530	8573513	But at least the guy that we got, that came out and fixed it, knew what was going on, so that's always good.
8573533	8575114	You get one of those, like, every now and then.
8575134	8576715	A Comcast employee knew what they were doing?
8577175	8579537	Hey, hey, you know they happen every now and then.
8580578	8584040	I guess for, uh, it's chaos theory.
8584060	8585301	Yep, exactly.
8585361	8585881	Exactly.
8586755	8588956	So, there are the few, the select few.
8589216	8591477	Yeah, we love Comcast, we really do.
8591557	8593258	Please don't pull the plug, please don't pull the plug.
8595218	8601801	Oh, and also, fuck you, Zach B., for just putting a picture of my leg.
8603502	8605102	I can understand, okay.
8605142	8606903	Be glad at least your leg got in there.
8606943	8611645	It was a good shot, it was an action shot, but the next page they have a picture of Rob's face.
8612485	8613606	I'm like, what about my face?
8614196	8615137	No one knows what I look like.
8615337	8616498	I am just a floating leg.
8616738	8618720	Well, it's semi-transparent, mind you.
8618740	8620621	That just goes to prove I'm sexier.
8622143	8622743	I'm just kidding.
8622843	8623784	I don't... I'm sorry.
8623804	8625726	Did you see the way I looked in that picture, though?
8625806	8629529	I'm like... I don't know if it was just me or not, but he looked like a freaking Sasquatch.
8630319	8633202	I swear, his eyebrows look... Yeah, Rob.
8633602	8640288	No, it's just like, I don't know what it was, but your eyebrows looked especially white in the picture, so you look like... I had big, bushy eyebrows.
8640448	8648535	You don't have... Okay, for anybody who hasn't seen Rob, which I'm pretty sure... Well, I'm on the camera right now, so it's dark as hell in here, so they can't see anything.
8648555	8649956	Like, you don't have white eyebrows.
8650586	8655689	I don't know what happened with that picture, but it looked like you seriously had no eyebrows, because they looked like they were shaving off and everything.
8655709	8658611	Well, maybe they had to Photoshop me, because my hideous face!
8658951	8662833	They're like, this guy's actually better looking than most radio personalities.
8662853	8663894	We've got to make him look bad.
8668136	8672179	Using crime technology, we're going to age him to look like Sasquatch.
8673640	8674280	Moving on.
8685478	8689660	An F you to the fact that moving out took me like three weeks to do, but I'm very happy it's over now.
8689680	8693521	An F you to the fact that we probably won't get the deposit back because landlords are cunts.
8693901	8695922	Actually, our old landlords are pretty decent.
8696042	8696782	I can't knock them.
8696822	8697462	They were decent.
8697982	8700303	But we'll see if we get the deposit back or not.
8700723	8704064	And I may be back here in three weeks saying that they are bitches, but we'll see.
8705985	8707806	So, yeah, F you to that.
8708266	8713308	And F you to the fact that I really don't feel like I had a vacation, even though I've had three days off of work.
8713328	8714488	So I've had like a five-day weekend.
8714813	8716214	I don't feel like I had a vacation at all.
8717195	8719596	I'm still tired, and I'm like, oh my god, I have to go to work tomorrow?
8719616	8720197	Life sucks!
8720557	8721778	I hate being a grown-up!
8721918	8722438	I hate it!
8723879	8726801	Let's see what other people in our room have to say for the FUs of the week.
8726821	8729043	We'll start it off with, uh, where are we gonna go?
8729103	8729483	Arcadian42.
8729563	8738029	Uh, fuck you to my computer being old and slow, and can't really afford a new one right now.
8738669	8742772	Hopefully soon, but, you know, I put myself in more debt than I am right now.
8743948	8747291	Oh well, and fuck you to the next week because it's going to be slow at work.
8747811	8749172	I'll be bored half the time.
8750513	8752314	And, eh, I get it.
8752534	8753095	That's about it.
8756497	8757018	Ice Queen.
8758339	8759159	That's Princess Bitch.
8760320	8761861	Whatever, you're the biggest queen of them all.
8764183	8764683	That's true.
8766705	8767045	I don't know.
8768126	8769647	Sorry, somebody... Give the FUs.
8769947	8771068	Stop screaming like a bitch.
8771989	8772189	Okay.
8772762	8780007	Fuck you to Toyotas for being pieces of shit and trying to rip me off for 900 freaking dollars and having to take my fucking three weeks in a row.
8780467	8781208	Yeah, that too.
8783750	8784390	Well, I had to.
8784590	8787152	Anyway, so yeah, fuck you to that.
8787192	8795358	Fuck you to people who write up facts on how to get rid of viruses and tell you to do shit that's going to fuck up your computer because I'm still waiting on having mine completely fixed.
8796999	8800221	And fuck you to everybody who makes more money than me, which is just about everybody.
8800582	8801462	Okay, that's it.
8802023	8802223	Angel.
8804275	8807557	There are a few online classes because they're boring, but hey, whatever, I'm getting my shit done.
8807697	8814341	So, um, yeah, and work is, okay, but work is work.
8814701	8815601	Um, I will shut up now.
8815641	8816042	Bye-bye.
8816342	8817642	Alright, BlankyStyle.
8820044	8830049	Uh, just, uh, fuck you to people who don't take care of your cars, and you post them online saying, oh, there's nothing wrong with it, I swear, and then you totally sound like a dipshit on the phone who doesn't know what the fuck you're talking about.
8830309	8832691	I guess that should be a big red flag and make me wonder, you know, why...
8833803	8834764	Yeah, okay.
8834804	8835785	Rob, you're...
8861272	8862413	You don't need to go there.
8862493	8862793	Really?
8862813	8865274	Yeah, remember when you got those tires a little while back?
8865414	8865954	Oh, shit.
8865994	8868575	Remember how good that car ran after you got new tires on it?
8868595	8871016	Maybe you should get some new ones now.
8871056	8871876	Or get them rotated.
8872557	8873817	You have to get your tires rotated?
8873837	8876118	You should rotate them after so many miles.
8877198	8880320	I heard once, like, I heard this rumor that some cars you have to put air in your tires.
8880380	8880760	Is that true?
8881929	8885752	Well, some of them actually have a totally solid center, like a cream fill.
8886293	8887193	Oh, like a Twinkie.
8887234	8887914	Yeah, like a Twinkie.
8887974	8889195	Yeah, I think I have Twinkie tires.
8889235	8890997	Yeah, you won't need to fill those with air.
8891017	8894319	Gosh, people.
8894940	8895881	Mmm, Twinkie.
8896802	8901606	Honestly, Twinkie tires would be the best invention ever, at least if, you know, your tire pulls a flat.
8901946	8902727	Oh, yeah!
8902827	8903908	Twinkie filling!
8904568	8906250	Woohoo!
8906390	8908852	Mmm, I'm full of Twinkie goodness.
8908872	8910233	Mmm, this is a delicious flat.
8911246	8920468	Now I just need to make a deep fryer big enough so I can fry them whenever I'm... It reminds me of that one Spamusement, which, by the way, is the best online comic of all time, Spamusement.
8920528	8922049	Just hang up, don't listen to the show anymore.
8922109	8924029	It says something about, are you man enough for this?
8924509	8927150	And then it's like a deep-fried truck.
8927170	8930771	What was it, like, I don't remember what it was, like, Dale Earnhardt Jr.
8930851	8935932	on a flatbed with a fishing pole, deep-fried with country gravy.
8938073	8939533	God, it was Spamusement.
8940356	8943377	S-P-A-M-U-S-C Spamusement.
8943537	8945178	Just take amusement and put SP on it.
8945778	8946058	Alright.
8946578	8947458	Anyway, moving on.
8948579	8950919	DarkSakura, I have one more F you before we get to the chatroom F yous.
8951459	8955041	Just back to the other thing I was saying before.
8956061	8964163	For everybody who, and this actually goes a lot broader, for all of you people who bitch about the situation you're in, fucking make it change!
8964584	8969285	You know who just do nothing but complain about it when there are ways to make it better?
8969710	8977093	and then they don't do it because it's effort or it'll wreck the boat or stop bitching.
8978174	8979595	Take control of your fucking life.
8980575	8980875	I'm done.
8982376	8984697	I actually forgot one more F you myself.
8985217	8991760	F you to the fact that to go see The Lion King, it costs $75 to sit in the first tier.
8992100	8997983	I was in the first balcony, $75 seats, and for that price, you would expect that there would be some nudity.
8998860	8999621	and there was no nudity.
8999641	9000463	Whoa, nudity where?
9000723	9001484	In the Lion King.
9002145	9003327	I don't think that's gonna be it.
9004389	9008231	Very upset at the lack of nudity in The Lion King, considering how much was paid to go see it.
9008291	9010853	Unless it was, uh, what's his name, uh, the guy that did Hairspray?
9011794	9013374	If you were to do The Lion King, yeah.
9013555	9018578	Well, you know, I realize that everybody brought their kids, and they were selling t-shirts that said Baby's First Musical and stuff.
9018998	9019858	I wanted nudity!
9019999	9021660	Were you hoping for Simba's shaved balls?
9022860	9023621	If nothing else.
9024341	9026903	Or, you know, or Mufasa and whatever.
9027023	9029304	I wanted to see Mufasa's Mufasa!
9029344	9032226	Mufasa's like, it's time to make a baby.
9033343	9034244	Roar!
9034764	9035344	Roar!
9035444	9037466	Alright, Ice Queen, yeah, one last FU.
9039267	9040007	No, yes, no.
9041668	9047011	My last FU was to Effort, because I heard Jamie's FUs, and fuck Effort, screw that.
9047111	9050413	I want to live and be rich and not have to move a freaking muscle.
9050833	9053715	I want to win the lottery and be just a complete leech off society.
9053735	9055216	You could be like that lady in Florida.
9055236	9055916	That is my dream.
9056577	9057597	But see, there's a difference.
9058178	9059399	You're not complaining about it.
9059459	9061700	I'm talking about to the people who say, I live...
9062299	9063620	I was just not complaining.
9063640	9067283	He doesn't call you at 9 o'clock at night.
9068324	9069565	My life sucks.
9069665	9070406	What did you do today?
9071407	9071867	Nothing.
9071907	9073189	I thought about paying a bill.
9074690	9081856	I'm just talking about all the people who live with their parents and say, Oh, my parents don't respect me.
9082256	9084098	And they make me do this.
9084258	9084618	And they're 30.
9086115	9090039	My parents bought me the old model SUV because they don't love me.
9090099	9093723	My parents want me to stop whoring out and go back to junior high.
9095044	9098708	My mommy yells at me, but I'm going to go out and buy an iPod.
9100390	9101832	Let's go to the chatroom, FU, shall we?
9103033	9104454	Started off with Miklatov.
9104695	9108819	Miklatov says, FU to not welcoming a cute boy's advances because I suck.
9109861	9110861	F you to being sick all week.
9111041	9112962	F you to E3 being too far away.
9113062	9114462	And F you to general boredom.
9114782	9118863	Miklatov, if you were here, I would not be shunning your advances, so you don't have to worry about that.
9119363	9120243	Oh, how nice are you.
9121183	9123904	Illusion says F you to a boring weekend.
9123944	9124424	That's it.
9124524	9125484	Not angsty this week.
9125644	9129945	Oh, and F you to About Schmidt for horribly depressing me by saying how significant life is.
9130965	9133186	And F you to the Live365 Awards.
9133526	9135346	You guys were O-L robbed.
9136367	9136647	Get it?
9136807	9137307	O-L-R.
9137467	9137967	O-L robbed.
9138107	9138327	Get it?
9142299	9166968	Zaku says, F you to the drunk tards in another apartment in my apartment complex who thought that the place needed a more loud cowbell last night F you to having to work off the books to make a living and F you to having to put off finding a summer job till after finals when there probably won't be any good jobs left Jaded2005 says, F you to this guy who keeps calling me and waking me up
9169198	9176780	DarkLionXVI says, F you to Spring Valley High School for suspending my cousin and his friend just because they were victims of a gang fight.
9177460	9185982	My cousin's the one who got hit in the head with a hammer and his friend saved his life, yet they were suspended and were about to face expulsion.
9186322	9189203	This is all over the local news and I hope they're embarrassed about it.
9189943	9191203	Were they trying to reenact, like,
9191710	9193552	Never mind, I don't want to go there.
9194192	9199636	F you to WYN Las Vegas for being the most disappointing opening on the strip.
9200037	9202699	Too many flowers on the inside and it's almost like the Bellagio.
9202739	9204881	The only good thing about that place is the damn poker room.
9205701	9210505	F you to KVVU Fox 5 Las Vegas for misspelling my cousin's last name.
9212507	9217751	DarkTetsuya says, F you to whatever was causing my loss of appetite about a week and a half ago.
9219453	9221054	That would probably be Roseanne Naked.
9223366	9223867	That's it.
9224507	9226707	You guys are kind of not angsty tonight.
9227628	9229048	I thought I was plenty angsty.
9229248	9233109	Well, no, you guys are plenty angsty, but I mean like the chat room.
9233429	9235129	They didn't vote and they weren't angsty.
9235149	9235870	What's wrong with you guys?
9237130	9239731	I think we're background noise for a lot of people tonight.
9240091	9241771	They're watching Family Guy.
9242931	9243252	Damn them.
9243272	9244212	We should just spoil it.
9244572	9245712	No, we better not do that.
9245752	9246712	Everybody dies.
9246752	9247633	Yeah, everybody dies.
9247833	9248453	The boat sinks.
9248693	9248933	Sorry.
9251107	9252907	Peter and... Stewie's gay.
9256948	9258149	Peter and Lois have sex.
9258669	9259369	Multiple times.
9261209	9262550	Alright, we're going to go to a quick break.
9262570	9266271	Then we're going to come back and do some Ask Orange Lounge.
9266411	9270052	I know it's been a little while since we've given you guys an opportunity to ask us questions.
9270472	9272172	But we've been gone a couple weeks and we're back.
9272572	9274433	So you're going to Ask Orange Lounge.
9274453	9278034	So send a private message to Sky in the chat room with any questions that you may have.
9278654	9279274	In this break...

9761921	9771169	The Orange Lounge Radio With the Ping Pong Ball
9791004	9795586	We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, and as promised, we're going to get into a little bit of Ask Orange Lounge.
9795606	9802010	This is where you guys get to direct the future of the show by asking us questions about what you would like to hear us talk about.
9802430	9803851	See, we're interactive like that.
9804191	9807133	So, here we go with some Ask Orange Lounge.
9814236	9817218	Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid questions.
9817711	9820892	What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?
9821392	9828394	It would be nice if I could concentrate, but the people in the kitchen are making so much goddamn noise that I can't think straight.
9833956	9835396	Song number one.
9835456	9836536	See, I can't think straight today.
9837577	9839577	Jaded2005 with question number one.
9840057	9843558	Me and my girlfriend have never seen you guys' faces.
9843778	9845499	What do you guys look like?
9849517	9851638	Folks from the kitchen saying they look like whores.
9851759	9854280	Well, the question wasn't about the folks in the kitchen, it's about us in here.
9854601	9855441	What do we look like?
9857162	9858463	We're damn sexy!
9858483	9863567	There's pictures of us online?
9863667	9876916	I look like Tom Cruise, and Matt looks like Matt Damon, and DarkSakura looks like Angelina Jolie, just like her.
9879372	9881693	I'm just, I'm making stuff up so that they, you know, can fantasize.
9881713	9887216	Well, at least she doesn't look like a freaking toothpick, like Nicole Kidman's turned herself into, anorexic.
9888456	9895239	Um, actually, if you guys want to see our pictures, we do have a picture gallery, if you're a registered user of OrangeOnTrader.com, and we don't spam you, there's no reason not to sign up.
9895599	9899581	Just head on over, and you'll see the picture galleries, and you can actually see pictures of us at E3.
9899921	9902562	So there's like plenty of pictures there, uh, from last year's E3.
9902743	9908045	Even Jamie, who's typically camera shy, can be seen in those pictures, if you know where to look.
9909204	9911346	Alright, question number two from Illusion.
9911846	9914829	Illusion would like to know, and perhaps Jamie you can answer this one for Illusion.
9915289	9918172	Illusion would like to know, why do women have breasts?
9920134	9923497	Genetically to provide sustenance for the child.
9925618	9927961	And to bring home a paycheck at the end of the day.
9929862	9930343	Stop.
9931444	9933305	It's for feeding babies.
9934006	9934987	It is for feeding babies.
9936610	9939051	and old four year old men who pay enough.
9941591	9942271	Just shut up.
9947612	9951553	And sometimes kittens because I saw that once on a Japanese TV show.
9953854	9954154	Okay.
9955534	9956114	Moving on.
9957354	9958955	Yeah, they do say breast milk is best.
9959155	9960955	Only on this show would somebody ask that question.
9961015	9962195	Why do women have boobies?
9963876	9964556	Ask your mama.
9964596	9965636	Dear Orange Lounge,
9966314	9967035	What's sex?
9968377	9969698	Why do I have a pee-pee?
9972662	9977528	Mikotov would like to know, what are you most looking forward to at E3 this year?
9979972	9980392	Uh, Loki.
9981193	9981654	Sleeping.
9984118	9985238	You're just going to sleep through E3?
9985278	9986659	That's the plan?
9986679	9990041	Sleeping after walking around during E3.
9990121	9990661	Oh, I see.
9990861	9992202	Honestly, you get tired.
9992662	9997164	No, but what I want to see, I want to see Sinbad being ignored again.
9999505	10001446	Tell the Sinbad story for those new listeners.
10002227	10006049	We saw Sinbad at E3 last year, and he waved, and no one cared.
10006069	10008370	Everyone was just like, Who's that guy?
10008410	10009070	Who's that guy?
10009410	10009991	It's Sinbad.
10010531	10010611	Oh.
10012265	10012986	Poor guy.
10013887	10015989	Say, look at me!
10016510	10017531	Hi!
10017551	10018592	Hi?
10018612	10018652	Hi?
10021615	10024138	Poor Sinbad.
10024178	10030065	What I'm most looking forward to at E3 this year is the fact that there's going to be DDR with Mario.
10030285	10032087	I think that's going to be a fun game to check out.
10032563	10037530	and I'm also looking forward to seeing what Nintendo turns out with the new Zelda and possibly a new console.
10037591	10038111	Possibly.
10038532	10042518	And I'm looking forward to actually seeing progress on the Nintendo DS.
10042818	10043679	I'm looking forward to that as well.
10044941	10045382	DarkSakura.
10045662	10047445	I'm looking forward to ogling over the Marines.
10048851	10050732	There will be lots of men in uniform.
10051772	10062675	I am expecting, I'm hoping this year with metrosexuality pushing more and more, as much as that word is stupid, pushing more and more into our culture, I'm looking for booth boys this year instead of booth babes.
10062715	10063776	I want some booth boys this year.
10065196	10066456	When I say boys, 18 and over, please.
10066476	10069577	With the general demographic of being Nuri...
10072858	10076939	You know, late 20s... That's starting to be more and more bullshit, though.
10077079	10079939	Women are starting to play games more and more and more and more and more.
10080200	10081740	I mean, that's been a long time coming.
10082080	10082340	Right.
10082720	10083860	Next thing you know, they'll want to vote.
10084260	10089721	Okay, honestly... This is your cue to tear into them.
10092262	10092802	Repeat, please.
10094322	10095782	I tend to ignore what he says.
10095882	10096982	Oh, allow me to repeat.
10097223	10099763	He said, next thing you know, they'll want to vote.
10102373	10103974	The ferrets haven't been unpacked yet, sorry.
10105954	10115196	Oh, in fact, actually, while you're at it, while you're at it, Illusion had the answer to his question from earlier, why do women have breasts?
10115236	10120658	He sent another message that says, the correct answer was, so you got something to look at when you're talking to them.
10125639	10126299	Where's the webcam?
10126880	10128540	The webcam's over there, but it's very dark.
10130128	10132210	I'm up here, not down there, now go away.
10134151	10135892	That's it, mastectomy.
10138193	10142596	And some women aren't just not up here and not down there, they're down a little bit lower.
10143956	10144337	Like grandma?
10144357	10145377	Those are people in their 60s.
10147419	10147799	Saggy.
10147939	10148999	I don't look at grandma's breasts.
10149019	10151041	That is the result of bra burning in the 70s.
10153280	10154741	Honestly, yeah.
10154781	10156082	What was the point of that?
10156423	10157023	I mean, honestly.
10157043	10159425	We're not going to be considered by bras.
10160706	10161687	Oh, yay.
10162308	10168193	Because they saw that as a symbol of, you know, men keeping their fit on women.
10168213	10172576	But the whole thing, bras are there to support your boobs so you're not saggy.
10173077	10174818	I know some men that like to wear bras.
10175379	10176099	They're like, they're like.
10176119	10177761	Because they got tits.
10179389	10180611	They won't hold us back!
10180711	10182273	Now spray us with that hose!
10182494	10182614	Oh.
10186620	10187081	Anyways.
10187722	10190326	I gotta play the sexist role on this show.
10190346	10190446	It's
10192486	10196207	Oh, right, all right, the role, the role that you fit into.
10196267	10210131	Okay, honestly, I've been talking to, you know, my fiancée, and she says that women are not bad drivers, but every time I see a goddamn, you know, crazy bitch on the road, it's always some stupid woman on her cell phone driving an SUV.
10210512	10213072	I can't help it if they keep perpetuating the stereotype.
10213672	10215113	I got stuck behind...
10215934	10218938	An old man driving an SUV talking on his cell phone.
10218978	10219438	Exactly.
10219678	10221701	They fall into the old people category.
10221941	10223102	Was he burning his bra?
10223323	10225685	He was burning his pampers.
10225705	10226927	I don't know.
10227267	10229089	Whatever it is the old men wear depends.
10230791	10231592	Old men are nasty.
10233063	10239145	By the way, my new roommate is looking in on the room right now, kind of going, what the hell are these people doing right now?
10239765	10240685	Can we interview you, please?
10241105	10244066	Don't you agree women suck at driving?
10245586	10246427	This is my new roommate.
10246447	10246787	Say hello.
10246927	10247627	Hello.
10247927	10250828	How much DDR do you play?
10250868	10251888	How familiar are you with DDR?
10252686	10256669	Um, well, I just, like, played the game that my sister bought.
10257130	10261253	Which is DDR Extreme on PS2.
10261433	10262033	And it was fun.
10262994	10266317	What do you think about the fact that your roommate does this crazy internet radio program?
10266777	10272341	It's craziness with a capital K. Um, no, I think it's cool.
10273482	10275483	This is the first time I've seen you do it, so it's cool.
10275704	10276684	Are we nerds or what?
10277325	10277365	Um...
10277873	10278874	You're a crazy nerd.
10278914	10282456	I like that you're entertaining the guests out in the kitchen who have long since abandoned the show.
10283096	10283897	That's cool, yeah.
10283937	10284877	Now tell them to keep it down out there.
10284897	10285698	We're trying to do a show in here.
10285898	10286538	Keep it down.
10286658	10288319	Oh, okay, I'll go that way.
10288699	10288920	Whoa.
10289540	10290320	What the hell was that noise?
10291521	10291881	That was weird.
10291921	10292582	Anyway, sorry.
10292702	10293482	It must be interference.
10294603	10295163	Whoa, okay.
10296064	10296384	Okay.
10296564	10297064	All right, well.
10297304	10298465	All right, well, nice seeing you.
10298485	10298705	Okay.
10299386	10300767	Get out of the room that you pay rent for.
10300787	10301367	No, I'm just kidding.
10302347	10303088	No, but honestly.
10305051	10310112	I mean, like I said, there are the slight few, just like good Comcast cable, you know.
10310372	10311172	I drive well.
10311712	10312852	I said the slight few.
10313052	10316113	People don't pull out in front of me in their taxi van.
10316273	10316993	Exactly.
10317213	10318233	I beeped at this guy.
10318553	10325475	I was like, beep, beep, and I ended up having to swerve into the other lane, and then I slid because of the freaking, you know, rain.
10325575	10327675	You know, everyone knows that taxi drivers suck.
10327695	10328915	I've actually wanted to do that.
10328975	10333156	Instead of actually honking my horn, rolling down the window, and sticking my head out and yelling, beep, beep.
10333616	10335237	Because I think people would notice me more then.
10335437	10337999	As you hit something and your head gets taken off.
10338259	10339640	Hey, you sucker!
10340060	10341541	I'm about to run into your ass!
10341602	10343703	Extend your left arm out.
10344604	10346365	Extend your middle finger up.
10349527	10352069	Anyways, we totally sidestepped whatever that question was.
10352269	10354130	I'm going to post pictures of my car in the chatroom.
10354410	10355351	Ninst has a question.
10356351	10358393	Ninst says he's kind of stretching for a question here.
10358453	10359534	Skip it if you've got a better one.
10359574	10360034	Well, we don't.
10361011	10365537	I'm going to be getting another 2DX game soon, so 7th style or 8th style?
10367140	10367220	8th.
10367240	10369122	8th.
10369262	10369863	I say 7th.
10371265	10377654	That's actually a toss-up because I like what's on 7th, but I really like what's on 8th, so... Get 6th.
10377674	10377734	8th.
10380478	10381098	I like Seventh.
10381278	10382519	I'm going to be the lone hold-up for Seventh.
10382539	10385740	Although, honestly, in Eighth Style, you get a lot of the good Seventh Style songs.
10385820	10390722	But, but, but, but, Beauty of Silence, Sound of Goodbye, but, but, but, you know, that's just me.
10392462	10393322	I don't play 2DX.
10395743	10398384	Lastly, a question, because we didn't get any more than this.
10398444	10399705	Legend of Zaku has this.
10399765	10400665	Oh, this is beautiful.
10401305	10408748	After stumbling through the Errand in Japan forums, I managed to find a thread that has what appears to be a link for a DDR movie in production.
10410111	10413453	Here's the link of the story since the main site is down and then he gave a link here.
10413893	10416375	What chances do you give this so-called movie in the works?
10416415	10418036	So I looked at the link he gave and here it is.
10419037	10423419	Dance Dance Revolution is the name of the popular video game created by the well-known game company Konami.
10423840	10427622	The current team consists... Okay, right there, you know it's a fake.
10428262	10428883	You can tell, right?
10428923	10430844	What is wrong with the first sentence that makes this a fake?
10432545	10432965	Konami.
10434146	10434866	It's not Konami.
10434886	10435207	What?
10435747	10435867	What?
10436855	10438517	It says, well-known game company, Konami.
10438797	10440378	Konami does much more than just video games.
10440819	10441920	Much, much more than just video games.
10442300	10442600	Remember?
10442760	10443841	They create slot machines.
10444061	10446644	Oh, yeah, but primarily they're known for the video games.
10446664	10449246	But I'm saying, if this were an official press release, that wouldn't say that.
10449847	10450267	I don't think.
10450647	10452049	It would say something like game publishers.
10452249	10453590	Either that or these people are just stupid.
10454070	10457774	The current team consists of two members so far, and I'm not even going to read their names.
10458334	10459275	Creator and directors.
10459355	10460236	Two guys I've never heard of.
10460816	10462978	We started Dance Dance Revolution the movie in 2005.
10464858	10466580	Alrighty then, time for the storyline.
10466600	10470683	18-year-old Emi Toshiba's lifelong dream was to become a professional dancer.
10471264	10474527	One day, she sees a flyer on a liquor store's window announcing a dance contest.
10474627	10479251	As she runs for the big-time winner with her partner, Rage, they meet some new friends, rivals, and conflicts.
10479411	10485916	As Emi is settling into her new surroundings, she and her new friends gradually become aware that not all is quite right in the contest.
10486217	10489760	Something sinister is lurking deep in the shadows of the dancing stage.
10490575	10493496	The movie is all about competition, love, and accepting others as they are.
10493536	10496097	So if you like drama, comedy, and DDR, this is the movie for you!
10497237	10503019	The plans, we're going to produce the movie in 2007 or 2008, depending on when we'll get enough money for the production.
10503479	10505819	Depending on when we graduate from college.
10507620	10508640	You know what, it's not going to happen.
10508660	10510801	That's like a plot of maybe an anime for it.
10512719	10515299	It sounds like Emmy of Rage Liquor Store.
10515860	10516740	Oh my god!
10517060	10518360	I want to be dancer!
10518580	10523821	Emmy, by the way, is going to be played by a big-breasted Asian chick in order to sell tickets.
10523881	10524381	I'll watch it.
10526141	10528102	Honestly, I don't care what it's about.
10528162	10535283	You can just get that chick from BMX XXX, the one that strips down naked and is dressed up like a schoolgirl.
10535763	10537163	That'll get me to see that movie.
10537743	10541284	That's all you need to show is her dressed up like a schoolgirl stripping down naked.
10542469	10544933	In the trailer, that will sell tickets.
10545594	10547857	Hell, they should just make BMX XXX the movie.
10548057	10548638	That would be better.
10550320	10553484	Every six months, the topic of DDR the movie is coming up.
10554906	10556589	Stop believing it!
10557370	10558951	There's only one way this will happen.
10559051	10569896	Until it is posted on IMDB or announced by a reputable has a reputation, right?
10570357	10572678	One of the big five movie production companies.
10572698	10573558	You know who's going to do this?
10573598	10576060	Even if it's Lionsgate, wait for them to announce it.
10576120	10576800	You know who's going to?
10577080	10578341	Now Lionsgate's not all bad.
10578361	10578961	I know, I know.
10578981	10579801	Don't be knocking Lionsgate.
10579821	10580862	I'm not going to knock Lionsgate.
10580882	10592087	I was just going to say, you know who would stoop this low, Uyval?
10592507	10598290	He would do this because he's like, ooh, an excuse to have another rave on an island.
10601308	10601328	10K...
10612956	10615357	Oh, God, don't start on that again.
10615397	10616997	That's another fanboy thing, though.
10617037	10620178	I mean, with all due respect to the folks that created it, come on.
10620358	10621178	But here's the thing, though.
10621658	10622938	That's the only way that it would work.
10623458	10626159	And the whole focus of it's not really on DDR.
10626179	10629760	They play DDR in it, but that's not really the focus of it.
10630120	10632740	But I like the setup that they do for the tournament.
10632760	10634361	The tournament setup was kind of cool.
10634781	10635961	It made it look cool.
10636141	10638062	That's the only way that it would work.
10638582	10639262	None of this, like...
10639858	10640679	Bloodsport DDR Edition
10666624	10669385	I think now would be a good time to end Ask Orange Lounge.
10669405	10670085	What do you guys think?
10671145	10672186	I think not.
10673426	10676207	Actually, I'm being linked to something in the chatroom.
10676247	10678268	It is something that's on Internet Movie Database.
10679448	10681289	Let's see, I think this is what I think it is.
10681889	10683189	Hold on, I'm trying to load the link right now.
10683770	10685050	It's in the chatroom.
10685070	10686911	Yeah, Dance Dance Documentary.
10689291	10689651	I don't know.
10689691	10693073	It's something that folks... What is this?
10693553	10694213	It's a DVD...
10695947	10696848	It's a documentary.
10698689	10699329	Eh, big deal.
10699550	10700250	I mean, no offense.
10700710	10701911	I think I was in one of these.
10702091	10703392	I got interviewed for one of these.
10703412	10707976	They wanted me to wear the Dr. Dick hat, the orange hat, and I wouldn't do it because I knew it was being made for a movie.
10708696	10711698	I don't know if that's the one or if it was some other college project or something.
10711718	10713079	Yeah, it was a college project.
10713100	10713620	I don't know.
10715171	10716352	This isn't the same thing.
10716432	10717833	Documentaries are one thing.
10717893	10721276	Documentaries, you know, a lot of people unfortunately don't see.
10721336	10728121	It's a lot of projects that, you know, I'm sure they're fine films, but, you know, we're talking about like a fiction type thing.
10728161	10730122	Big budget, basically, movie here.
10730763	10732144	Even a million dollars could be a big budget.
10732164	10736467	I don't think anyone's going to actually be... See, here's the problem with this whole movie idea.
10737288	10741691	Maybe like, you know, a fan movie, possibly...
10742578	10743519	Big budget movie?
10743739	10743899	No.
10743979	10752905	Because even if DDR is uber popular, it doesn't lend itself to a movie at all, and you can't make a movie.
10752945	10757268	That's like Tetris the movie, and I know everyone likes joking about that.
10757688	10758449	It's impossible.
10759289	10766054	You have to make a movie where DDR is an element, but not the main force behind it.
10766774	10770317	You could do a buddy movie that somehow has DDR.
10770337	10771297	They like to play DDR.
10772489	10773270	Here's an example.
10773892	10774412	The Wizard.
10776075	10776917	That's not Nintendo.
10776957	10777999	The Wizard was gay.
10778159	10779962	Okay, that's not... Hey!
10780142	10782206	Okay, now that movie was good in the 80s.
10783911	10784672	It's so bad.
10784852	10785892	It did have Christian Slater.
10786153	10786433	Okay?
10786573	10794598	Now, granted, now, that's the only way that this type of thing would work, is where it's like an element of it, you know, but that's not the main storyline.
10794658	10798241	You know, it's not just, oh, look at us, we're playing DDR all the time.
10798401	10803984	I mean, like the Wizard, they had some more crap, like the stupid kid, like, California!
10804725	10805385	I hated him.
10807246	10808527	But yeah, something like that.
10808567	10809488	And then they had the Power Glove.
10810429	10810729	So bad.
10810749	10811009	Yeah.
10812809	10816713	That's the end of another fabulous episode of Orange Lounge Radio, boys and girls.
10816753	10819815	Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts, starting with Angel.
10821056	10821817	Angel, your final thought.
10823538	10825099	I've been too quiet this episode.
10825139	10825600	I'm sorry.
10826420	10826981	That's okay.
10827501	10828922	Arcadian42, your final thought.
10830584	10833086	I'm gonna... Loki, your final thought.
10834126	10836268	I'm not sexist or racist.
10836348	10837529	I just play one on the radio.
10838950	10840151	My final thought is...
10843615	10847617	That does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live.
10847637	10851460	Orange Lounge Radio Live is an Orange Lounge Radio production.

11009161	11010042	That was wonderful.
11010062	11010682	Bravo.
11010863	11011403	I loved that.
11011423	11012084	That was great.
11012224	11013105	Well, it was pretty good.
11013205	11014226	Well, it wasn't bad.
11014346	11015967	Well, there were parts of it that weren't very good, though.
11015987	11016808	It could have been a lot better.
11017008	11017889	I didn't really like it.
11017969	11018930	It was pretty terrible.
11018990	11019610	It was bad.
11019691	11020291	It was awful.
11020311	11021292	It was terrible.
11021312	11021933	Get him away.
11021973	11022493	Hey, boo.
11022533	11023014	Boo.
11024375	11027838	Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.
11041804	11045648	Yeah, after that one, I think we know that we definitely need to rotate the FU music.
11046629	11047550	That's going to be great.
11048471	11053936	I will work my butt off to get the new intro done, but first, the playlist shuffle is happening tomorrow.
11054156	11055457	I've got to get that done.
11055517	11057359	I'll hopefully get it done tonight after the show.
11057539	11058220	But not for that.
11058821	11059021	But...
11059778	11060579	I'm working on that.
11061240	11066044	Orange Lounge Radio is going to change and stuff, and we were serious, so it's going to happen.
11066064	11067225	Hopefully the website soon, too.
11067265	11068266	I just need new graphics.
11068827	11070108	I'm working on it.
11070589	11072631	I just can't think.
11072731	11073592	I'm trying to.
11075013	11075954	I'm in school!
11079377	11083582	Alright, boys and girls, thanks a bunch for tuning in tonight and listening to and supporting Orange Lounge Radio.
11083622	11083982	We love
