[SPEAKER_05]: For another week, we are here with the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, our podcast dedicated to what's going on in the gamer world.

[SPEAKER_05]: This is information that gamers really want to know about.

00:32.269 --> 00:34.310
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, this week we're famous.

00:34.970 --> 00:35.790
[SPEAKER_05]: Famous!

00:35.830 --> 00:36.351
[SPEAKER_05]: Famous!

00:36.391 --> 00:37.131
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you know me?

00:37.531 --> 00:38.411
[SPEAKER_05]: I am so famous.

00:38.591 --> 00:39.372
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Rob Roberts.

00:39.392 --> 00:40.132
[SPEAKER_05]: You might know me as Sky.

00:40.172 --> 00:43.793
[SPEAKER_05]: The famous voices you hear behind me is the lovely Dark Sakura, known as Jamie Summers.

00:43.813 --> 00:45.114
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because I'm an internet celebrity.

00:46.074 --> 00:47.374
[SPEAKER_05]: And the one and only Loki.

00:48.075 --> 00:49.075
[SPEAKER_05]: Just call me The Foot.

00:50.287 --> 00:51.288
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:13.405 --> 01:14.586
[SPEAKER_05]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

01:36.280 --> 01:41.124
[SPEAKER_03]: At least, you know, they picked the most toned part of my body to take a picture of my foot.

01:41.384 --> 01:42.985
[SPEAKER_03]: Although your feet were kind of curving funny.

01:43.005 --> 01:43.746
[SPEAKER_03]: That was very interesting.

01:44.246 --> 01:45.267
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what happened there.

01:45.387 --> 01:47.569
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just... I don't know.

01:47.769 --> 01:51.893
[SPEAKER_05]: So big thanks to Sackbee for filling our media horror ego.

01:51.953 --> 01:52.593
[SPEAKER_05]: We do love that.

01:53.114 --> 01:57.757
[SPEAKER_05]: And if anybody else wants to, you know, help us inflate our media horror ego, send us a message.

01:58.378 --> 02:01.560
[SPEAKER_05]: They sold six more papers the other day.

02:01.580 --> 02:02.321
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

02:03.415 --> 02:09.716
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, did you guys know that last week we were 1up.com's audio blog of the day at some point last week?

02:10.076 --> 02:11.917
[SPEAKER_00]: We're even more of an internet celebrity now.

02:11.977 --> 02:12.797
[SPEAKER_05]: That was just awesome.

02:12.817 --> 02:14.137
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you guys over at 1up.com.

02:14.677 --> 02:17.378
[SPEAKER_05]: I think 1up.com is a neat, neat idea.

02:17.478 --> 02:18.778
[SPEAKER_05]: I love their community stuff.

02:18.798 --> 02:21.759
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm not just saying that because they made us audio blog of the day.

02:21.799 --> 02:24.039
[SPEAKER_05]: I've actually been a member of the community for longer.

02:24.419 --> 02:25.160
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's neat.

02:25.380 --> 02:26.360
[SPEAKER_05]: I was very happy about that.

02:26.640 --> 02:27.820
[SPEAKER_05]: It's nice to be respected by your peers.

02:27.960 --> 02:31.401
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, with all these blogs and everything, I'm thinking about starting up a new one on MySpace.

02:32.245 --> 02:32.705
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.

02:32.725 --> 02:34.426
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting up at Orange Lounge on MySpace.

02:34.446 --> 02:38.889
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, actually, I just found out today at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, we have the capability to do blogs there.

02:39.049 --> 02:39.829
[SPEAKER_05]: We just don't.

02:40.310 --> 02:40.830
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I don't know.

02:40.850 --> 02:41.610
[SPEAKER_05]: We may have to do something.

02:41.770 --> 02:42.251
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see, though.

02:42.271 --> 02:42.531
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

02:42.911 --> 02:47.734
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, enough about us inflating our egos, although we have to take time to inflate our egos once in a while.

02:48.494 --> 02:52.336
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you want to help inflate our egos, you could vote for us on Podcast Alley.

02:52.516 --> 02:58.399
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, just do a search for Orange and then vote us on Orange Lounge Radio on PodcastAlley.com.

02:58.960 --> 02:59.060
[SPEAKER_05]: And...

02:59.704 --> 03:00.845
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

03:28.101 --> 03:32.963
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I did play a little Luminous, but eh.

03:33.023 --> 03:35.464
[SPEAKER_00]: I watched Dan beat Metal Gear Acid.

03:35.824 --> 03:36.565
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, how was that?

03:37.025 --> 03:38.385
[SPEAKER_00]: He said that game was trippy and hard.

03:39.006 --> 03:42.507
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think of Metal Gear Acid compared to the rest of the series lately?

03:42.607 --> 03:45.148
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not into card games, and I'm not into strategy games.

03:45.208 --> 03:48.730
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more like a real-time strategy, and I don't like those type of things.

03:48.950 --> 03:51.030
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, you're welcome to it.

03:51.050 --> 03:54.872
[SPEAKER_00]: If you like Fire Emblem and like Metal Gear, you'll like this game.

03:54.892 --> 03:57.113
[SPEAKER_04]: Fair enough.

03:57.605 --> 03:58.125
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really it.

03:58.325 --> 03:58.886
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, how about you?

03:59.326 --> 04:03.747
[SPEAKER_03]: First, I'd like to say Metal Gear Acid reminds me of Phantasy Star... Was it a 4?

04:03.907 --> 04:05.348
[SPEAKER_03]: Phantasy Star Online 4?

04:06.288 --> 04:07.389
[SPEAKER_05]: It was Volume 3.

04:07.489 --> 04:07.789
[SPEAKER_03]: Volume 3.

04:09.230 --> 04:10.410
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, the card game.

04:10.450 --> 04:11.670
[SPEAKER_03]: We all remember how that worked.

04:11.771 --> 04:13.771
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it worked about just the same for Metal Gear Acid.

04:13.791 --> 04:17.153
[SPEAKER_05]: Funny enough, with Phantasy Star 4, now they're going back to what worked in 1 and 2.

04:17.333 --> 04:17.873
[SPEAKER_05]: Funny enough.

04:18.253 --> 04:21.994
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the card game to things... Ah, you know what?

04:22.955 --> 04:23.675
[SPEAKER_03]: Buy cards.

04:24.015 --> 04:25.756
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're going to play a card game, play a card game.

04:26.175 --> 04:28.797
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't play a game that's a video game that's a card game.

04:29.357 --> 04:30.958
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just redundant.

04:31.198 --> 04:31.898
[SPEAKER_03]: That's too much.

04:32.639 --> 04:38.042
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, my week, I played one game, and that one game would be Ridge Racer for the PSP.

04:38.642 --> 04:47.247
[SPEAKER_03]: And I went through about, oh man, like 13 of the World Tour things.

04:47.328 --> 04:50.029
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm now on Pro 20, I think.

04:50.689 --> 04:53.051
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just unlocked the RallyX car.

04:53.948 --> 04:55.429
[SPEAKER_03]: by beating the minigame.

04:55.449 --> 04:57.009
[SPEAKER_03]: We got 50,000 points on that.

04:57.149 --> 05:03.912
[SPEAKER_03]: So I got the Rally-X car, which is so awesome because the Rally-X car is all pixelated just like, you know, the actual game.

05:03.992 --> 05:07.714
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you use the Nitro Boost, it does these little pixelated clouds behind you.

05:08.734 --> 05:10.915
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, just like it did in Rally-X if you played the old game.

05:10.935 --> 05:11.956
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, like the smoke screen.

05:12.236 --> 05:17.158
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was, I think, it's just little details like that Namco throws in that's awesome.

05:19.069 --> 05:23.870
[SPEAKER_03]: The race before they had the race, what they called, I guess, the devil car or something like that.

05:24.591 --> 05:25.651
[SPEAKER_03]: And that sucked.

05:25.711 --> 05:26.491
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a one-on-one race.

05:26.551 --> 05:36.514
[SPEAKER_03]: But see, what's really awesome is once you get past Pro 18, it's all like kind of challenge mode type stuff where you have like one-on-one races with stuff to unlock special cars and whatnot.

05:36.674 --> 05:37.714
[SPEAKER_03]: And those are really cool.

05:37.734 --> 05:39.935
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've been playing this game like all week.

05:40.015 --> 05:41.795
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's held my attention that long.

05:41.855 --> 05:43.776
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a really, really good game.

05:44.436 --> 05:44.636
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.

05:44.696 --> 05:45.136
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything else then?

05:47.343 --> 05:48.584
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all I played this week.

05:48.764 --> 05:49.824
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't played anything else.

05:50.604 --> 05:53.665
[SPEAKER_05]: I have kind of a different story than you do for my gaming week.

05:53.725 --> 05:54.686
[SPEAKER_05]: You were on PSP.

05:54.746 --> 05:55.506
[SPEAKER_05]: I was on DS.

05:55.986 --> 05:58.467
[SPEAKER_05]: I picked up a new game called Polarium for the DS.

05:58.827 --> 05:59.547
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a puzzle game.

05:59.627 --> 06:00.867
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been looking at that one, too.

06:00.887 --> 06:01.527
[SPEAKER_05]: Were you looking at that?

06:02.388 --> 06:03.508
[SPEAKER_00]: That and Mercury for PSP.

06:04.628 --> 06:06.589
[SPEAKER_05]: I picked up Polarium because I'm a big puzzle game fan.

06:06.689 --> 06:07.289
[SPEAKER_05]: I loved Luminous.

06:07.309 --> 06:08.469
[SPEAKER_05]: This goes back to Tetris.

06:11.226 --> 06:39.223
[SPEAKER_05]: Yoshi's Cookie and Tetris Attack and those types of games too so I picked up Polarium which is basically the concept of Polarium is that you have all these squares so at first glance you might think it's kind of like Luminous but it has nothing to do with it really their games aren't the same at all but you use the stylus you draw lines and that's how you're changing you're swapping tiles and I know that sounds really simple but because you can only draw the lines so fast you actually have to think ahead about how you're going to draw the lines so it sounds like a pretty killer concept huh um

06:40.616 --> 06:43.258
[SPEAKER_05]: Polarium held my attention for about an hour, and then I was done with it.

06:44.058 --> 06:45.779
[SPEAKER_05]: I was very disappointed with Polarium.

06:46.039 --> 06:47.060
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just me personally.

06:47.800 --> 06:50.322
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought the graphics were boring as heck.

06:51.322 --> 06:53.523
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought it sounded like garbage.

06:54.624 --> 06:58.886
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought the puzzles were kind of interesting, but I just didn't like the concept.

06:58.966 --> 07:00.347
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I take that back.

07:00.939 --> 07:02.700
[SPEAKER_05]: I like the idea of the game.

07:03.141 --> 07:05.222
[SPEAKER_05]: It kind of makes you go, hmm, could this be a fun puzzle game?

07:05.242 --> 07:06.903
[SPEAKER_05]: But the execution didn't like it.

07:07.144 --> 07:08.384
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't recommend this game.

07:08.625 --> 07:09.265
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't like it at all.

07:09.585 --> 07:11.687
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially when you put it next to a game such as Luminous.

07:12.928 --> 07:16.330
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think this might be in some ways DS's answer to Luminous.

07:16.851 --> 07:19.292
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you think of it that way, you're really going to be disappointed.

07:19.352 --> 07:23.535
[SPEAKER_00]: This is nothing like... I think Mercury is also going to blow it out of the water too.

07:24.056 --> 07:26.377
[SPEAKER_05]: Luminous, the bar has been set so high with Luminous, I think.

07:27.258 --> 07:29.860
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm thinking that Mercury is going to be pretty big though.

07:30.903 --> 07:31.864
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm curious about Mercure.

07:31.884 --> 07:35.346
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm also curious about... I'm not giving up on DS just yet because I'm very, very curious about Meteos.

07:35.506 --> 07:36.747
[SPEAKER_05]: I've heard a lot of good things about that.

07:37.207 --> 07:38.948
[SPEAKER_03]: I want Smart Bomb.

07:39.208 --> 07:40.329
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I've been waiting for.

07:40.349 --> 07:44.131
[SPEAKER_05]: But Polarium was just... Polarium is the type of game I would have expected.

07:44.151 --> 07:46.513
[SPEAKER_05]: You know how they have third-party publishers?

07:46.983 --> 07:49.005
[SPEAKER_05]: DS is going to lose this battle unless things start changing fast.

08:14.529 --> 08:16.109
[SPEAKER_03]: These games are not impressive.

08:16.229 --> 08:20.610
[SPEAKER_03]: I know at E3 they're going to announce that stupid internet connectivity or whatever like that.

08:21.110 --> 08:24.351
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty solid.

08:24.391 --> 08:25.351
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what's going to happen.

08:26.152 --> 08:36.414
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think it's going to matter at this point because pretty soon the PSP's already got internet connectivity and they're going to have a web browser probably for that coming out this year.

08:36.594 --> 08:42.355
[SPEAKER_05]: If the revolution blows everything else out of the water, does the DS have a chance?

08:44.753 --> 08:45.433
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

08:45.934 --> 08:52.076
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to probably do a redesign of it just like they did with the Advance, and it's going to be another game system to buy.

08:52.096 --> 08:55.337
[SPEAKER_05]: All they need to do is to start putting out some more of their franchise games that are good.

08:55.377 --> 08:57.317
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, the Metroid demo was pretty nice.

08:57.357 --> 08:58.618
[SPEAKER_05]: They should put out the Metroid game.

08:58.638 --> 08:59.298
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't understand.

08:59.318 --> 09:02.759
[SPEAKER_05]: I know they're probably trying to finish it, but... Okay, okay, here's what I don't understand.

09:02.779 --> 09:04.900
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, yeah, you ported Mario 64.

09:05.040 --> 09:05.520
[SPEAKER_03]: Good for you.

09:07.060 --> 09:08.501
[SPEAKER_03]: Why didn't you make a new Mario game?

09:08.821 --> 09:09.941
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, this is what I'm wondering.

09:10.041 --> 09:10.922
[SPEAKER_03]: Why didn't you make a new game?

09:11.142 --> 09:11.942
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

09:13.424 --> 09:17.467
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I mean, they altered Mario 64, so it's almost like a whole different game when you play Yoshi and stuff.

09:17.487 --> 09:18.488
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll get the Game Boy Advance, though.

09:18.508 --> 09:20.409
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all it was for the most part, is ported games.

09:20.769 --> 09:23.190
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody got Pac-Pix out in Japan, and that's not fair.

09:24.851 --> 09:27.273
[SPEAKER_05]: Pac-Pix is coming out here very, very soon, though, which is exciting.

09:28.294 --> 09:29.634
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let's... No, let's go.

09:29.675 --> 09:29.935
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

09:30.155 --> 09:33.557
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I still want the Pac-Man Marble Madness type game.

09:34.537 --> 09:35.297
[SPEAKER_00]: That needs to hurry up.

09:35.338 --> 09:36.378
[SPEAKER_05]: Pack and roll.

10:04.588 --> 10:05.889
[SPEAKER_05]: VIRTUAL BOY PART 2 VIRTUAL BOY PART 2

10:28.035 --> 10:28.636
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty much.

10:28.656 --> 10:30.097
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's have a migraine.

10:30.397 --> 10:31.758
[SPEAKER_00]: You can pay $30 for it.

10:31.798 --> 10:33.400
[SPEAKER_05]: The Virtual Boy was kind of a cool idea, though.

10:33.700 --> 10:34.441
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it really was.

10:34.781 --> 10:38.244
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's the first thing my brain goes to when I hear about this revolution.

10:38.464 --> 10:41.727
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a good idea too early in its time.

10:41.787 --> 10:42.788
[SPEAKER_00]: It had fun commercials.

10:43.288 --> 10:45.110
[SPEAKER_03]: The Virtual Boy, it was a great idea.

10:45.631 --> 10:47.752
[SPEAKER_03]: Monochrome red, that was a bad point.

10:47.873 --> 10:50.595
[SPEAKER_03]: And the fact that it wasn't really that much of a portable machine.

10:50.615 --> 10:53.017
[SPEAKER_03]: You had to kind of sit it down on a table to be able to use it.

10:53.778 --> 10:54.919
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was the problem.

10:55.882 --> 11:09.368
[SPEAKER_05]: Now before you laugh this story off, consider that, and this is what the article goes on to say, consider that there have been recent patents filed by Nintendo that kind of support that this is possibly the direction.

11:09.448 --> 11:13.330
[SPEAKER_05]: Now obviously nothing's confirmed until Nintendo says something themselves, but speculate.

11:13.370 --> 11:16.932
[SPEAKER_03]: I am going to say that this is probably the case, and here's why I think that.

11:17.776 --> 11:20.157
[SPEAKER_03]: They have been very quiet about the revolution.

11:20.217 --> 11:21.337
[SPEAKER_03]: They haven't said anything.

11:21.397 --> 11:22.598
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is what's going to happen.

11:22.918 --> 11:26.939
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to have all this, like, you know, everyone's like, oh, PS3, you know, Xbox 360.

11:26.979 --> 11:29.860
[SPEAKER_03]: Then it's all, bam, revolution.

11:29.920 --> 11:39.563
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the Xbox 360 and the PS3, as far as, you know, improving the graphics and stuff, they haven't really done anything new.

11:40.743 --> 11:45.645
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's also Nintendo's been known for gimmicky type of things.

11:46.977 --> 11:47.498
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be interesting.

11:47.518 --> 11:52.940
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm looking forward to seeing if this is true or not and how this is all going to play out.

11:55.081 --> 11:57.242
[SPEAKER_05]: It's hard to say until I see it in action, you know what I mean?

11:57.463 --> 12:03.305
[SPEAKER_05]: The concept sounds interesting, although I really hope they've learned the mistakes from Virtual Boy and that this won't cause seizures and headaches.

12:04.186 --> 12:07.467
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm wondering if this new 3D stuff, if we'll see a Power Glove 2?

12:09.268 --> 12:09.769
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

12:10.009 --> 12:12.870
[SPEAKER_00]: You know that Nintendo licensed the Palm OS.

12:13.951 --> 12:14.231
[SPEAKER_01]: Hmm.

12:14.847 --> 12:22.634
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, actually, there's supposed to be making a cartridge to where you can run the Palm OS software on your DS.

12:22.974 --> 12:27.218
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be very interesting to see how the DS and the Revolution work together with the 3D projection things.

12:27.238 --> 12:28.920
[SPEAKER_05]: Will I be able to poke things with my stylus?

12:29.400 --> 12:38.148
[SPEAKER_03]: No, basically what the 3D projection is, it's going to be stereoscopic 3D, basically just like if you go into an IMAX movie and you have your glasses projected.

12:38.616 --> 12:40.017
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what you're going to get with this.

12:40.098 --> 12:42.700
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be 3D with glasses, I think.

12:42.740 --> 12:47.184
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're talking about 3D glasses, not actual hologram projection?

12:47.384 --> 12:50.567
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we're a little early for holograms.

12:50.587 --> 12:52.208
[SPEAKER_05]: But that would be revolutionary, would it not?

12:52.268 --> 12:53.169
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it would.

12:53.529 --> 12:56.352
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess, would that mean they would not need a TV for that or something?

12:56.932 --> 12:57.272
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

12:57.773 --> 12:58.173
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

12:58.233 --> 12:58.734
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

12:58.774 --> 13:00.495
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, hey, whatever they want to do.

13:00.555 --> 13:02.437
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if they've got holograms, hey.

13:03.923 --> 13:08.206
[SPEAKER_05]: Since Namco got brought up a little earlier in the show several times, I have a couple Namco stories tonight.

13:08.446 --> 13:11.328
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know this always makes DarkSakura happy because she's a big Namco fan.

13:13.049 --> 13:19.853
[SPEAKER_05]: What is happening is that Namco is going to be releasing a brand new compilation, yes, another one, for their 50th anniversary.

13:20.313 --> 13:28.237
[SPEAKER_05]: They are collecting 14 arcade titles and putting it out on PS2, GameCube, Xbox, PC, and GBA.

13:28.298 --> 13:32.260
[SPEAKER_05]: It's coming out in August and it's called the 50th Anniversary Arcade Collection.

13:33.052 --> 13:33.853
[SPEAKER_05]: Pac-Man, Ms.

13:33.893 --> 13:42.538
[SPEAKER_05]: Pac-Man, Galaga, Galaxian, Dig Dug, Pole Positions 1 and 2, Rally X, Rolling Thunder, and more, including Xevious, Mappy, etc.

13:42.578 --> 13:42.958
[SPEAKER_05]: Mappy!

13:44.279 --> 13:45.760
[SPEAKER_05]: Been there, done that, with all this.

13:45.800 --> 13:45.940
[SPEAKER_05]: Mappy!

13:46.260 --> 13:48.501
[SPEAKER_05]: Why can't I just go out and get the PlayStation 1 discs?

13:48.661 --> 13:49.442
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, what big deal?

13:49.462 --> 13:51.363
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they need to do what Sega did.

13:52.744 --> 13:53.885
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, with the Sega Ages.

13:54.365 --> 13:56.046
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of people were disappointed in Sega Ages, though.

13:56.066 --> 13:57.667
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, a lot of people were stupid.

13:59.423 --> 14:00.404
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't need RallyX.

14:00.564 --> 14:03.906
[SPEAKER_03]: RallyX is part of Ridge Racer for the PSP.

14:04.906 --> 14:08.729
[SPEAKER_00]: I could put in Tekken 5 and play Starblade until I'm giddy.

14:09.389 --> 14:10.169
[SPEAKER_00]: Which I'm already giddy.

14:10.610 --> 14:15.953
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a huge retro fan, don't get me wrong, but this is thoroughly uninteresting to me.

14:16.153 --> 14:16.473
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

14:17.274 --> 14:23.037
[SPEAKER_05]: They could do all the interviews in the world they want to, but I feel like I did this already ten years ago when the PlayStation came out, and

14:24.025 --> 14:31.031
[SPEAKER_05]: These games are great, and they hold a space in the arcade game greats of all time, but I'm just not interested in playing them.

14:31.071 --> 14:33.113
[SPEAKER_03]: I have another retro story.

14:33.193 --> 14:34.454
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, sure.

14:34.894 --> 14:45.543
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, this is, now, all of you might remember those wonderful, you know, the straight, you hook them up to the TV type of console systems, the flashbacks, what they call them.

14:45.959 --> 14:48.203
[SPEAKER_03]: Asteroids Breakout, Centipede, Lunar Lander, Millipede, Missile Command, Pong

14:59.349 --> 15:02.651
[SPEAKER_03]: But amongst 30 others total.

15:02.951 --> 15:07.834
[SPEAKER_03]: Now the flashbacks are the actual console, not the joystick that you plug in.

15:07.874 --> 15:08.715
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like the old Atari.

15:08.755 --> 15:09.495
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like a console.

15:09.776 --> 15:13.618
[SPEAKER_03]: This one, though, it's going to be great because it's going to be wood grain, just like the old ones.

15:13.638 --> 15:14.779
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

15:14.859 --> 15:23.965
[SPEAKER_05]: We were just talking about this because I remember we were talking about the Atari contest and that game Ninja Garden that got created in 24 hours is going to be in this, at least per that last story.

15:23.985 --> 15:24.205
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

15:24.605 --> 15:28.089
[SPEAKER_05]: and we were talking about the wood, I believe Jamie said something about it needs to be in the wood grain.

15:28.429 --> 15:30.692
[SPEAKER_05]: That is so cool if it is coming out in the wood grain.

15:30.732 --> 15:31.733
[SPEAKER_05]: Coming out this summer.

15:32.013 --> 15:33.295
[SPEAKER_00]: That totally would make me happy.

15:33.315 --> 15:35.537
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe people from Atari were listening to this, huh?

15:35.758 --> 15:37.640
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, this summer, this summer for about $30.

15:37.720 --> 15:38.601
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, $30 for Neoclassical Games?

15:41.201 --> 15:44.765
[SPEAKER_00]: Addressing this at Classic Gaming Expo, because you know that's coming up in a couple months.

15:44.865 --> 15:45.546
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't that weird?

15:45.606 --> 15:52.973
[SPEAKER_05]: I just slammed Namco on the been there, done that attitude, and now here I am getting all giddy about the woodgrain Atari.

15:53.213 --> 15:56.257
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all about, you know, how you execute it.

15:56.297 --> 15:57.157
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really what it is.

15:57.218 --> 15:57.858
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess you're right.

15:57.938 --> 15:58.419
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess you're right.

15:58.439 --> 16:03.144
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they've released these Namco collections before, and now they're just releasing it on a new system.

16:03.784 --> 16:08.686
[SPEAKER_03]: And, for example, I have one of the Namco collections for the GBA already.

16:09.006 --> 16:11.327
[SPEAKER_03]: They already have these games out in the GBA.

16:11.407 --> 16:14.249
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just re-releasing the same damn thing again.

16:14.409 --> 16:21.652
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, one thing, though, about those Namco collections on PS1, you do need to keep in mind that at least two of those are considered ultra-rare now.

16:22.292 --> 16:26.974
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot find the M, nor can you find the O. Actually, I take that back.

16:27.034 --> 16:28.535
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the A and the C. I take that back.

16:29.434 --> 16:31.515
[SPEAKER_00]: Which I actually, I think I have all of them now.

16:31.915 --> 16:35.157
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they've released the restricted symbol in Japan.

16:37.278 --> 16:39.059
[SPEAKER_00]: So actually, those are collector's items.

16:40.039 --> 16:43.121
[SPEAKER_00]: People are not going to be able to find those games on PS1.

16:43.261 --> 16:46.622
[SPEAKER_05]: But not a lot of those games are part of this compilation.

16:46.963 --> 16:50.784
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, even so, they're getting... I never saw Mappy released on one.

16:51.325 --> 16:52.665
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought Mappy was in the first one.

16:53.406 --> 16:54.126
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that I recall.

16:54.246 --> 16:54.566
[SPEAKER_00]: My bad.

16:55.006 --> 16:55.967
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, it probably was.

16:56.227 --> 16:58.048
[SPEAKER_00]: But even so, you know...

16:58.812 --> 16:59.152
[SPEAKER_00]: Namco Story

17:19.810 --> 17:23.233
[SPEAKER_05]: Another series now going from very old Namco to very new Namco.

17:23.313 --> 17:24.414
[SPEAKER_05]: Katamari Damacy 2.

17:25.235 --> 17:26.155
[SPEAKER_05]: Details released.

17:26.215 --> 17:28.817
[SPEAKER_00]: Nina Daisuke's Katamari Damacy.

17:29.718 --> 17:31.620
[SPEAKER_05]: Translates to We Love Katamari.

17:32.220 --> 17:34.382
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is... Actually, they changed the title for the US.

17:34.442 --> 17:34.762
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I'm sorry.

17:34.782 --> 17:37.284
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Everybody Loves Katamari Damacy in Japan.

17:37.304 --> 17:38.966
[SPEAKER_00]: And here it's We Love Katamari Damacy.

17:39.146 --> 17:39.867
[SPEAKER_05]: I just got served.

17:40.007 --> 17:40.287
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

17:40.887 --> 17:43.149
[SPEAKER_05]: It is going to be called We Love Katamari in North America.

17:43.710 --> 17:45.852
[SPEAKER_05]: And so this game is coming out here for sure.

17:45.952 --> 17:48.734
[SPEAKER_05]: There was still a little bit of a question mark, but it is coming out here.

17:50.201 --> 17:55.904
[SPEAKER_05]: Some great screenshots circulating out there on the internet, and it will be out in 2005, they're saying.

17:56.344 --> 18:03.527
[SPEAKER_05]: New locations, new objects, Eiffel Tower's been spotted, cats, trees, junk, humans.

18:03.567 --> 18:04.647
[SPEAKER_00]: Not to mention the new play modes.

18:05.188 --> 18:11.650
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, and apparently the co-op mode now is in better levels than just like, it was like an arena in the first one.

18:11.970 --> 18:14.151
[SPEAKER_00]: That was more of a versus.

18:14.371 --> 18:18.273
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, for the first one to even have that kind of versus mode in it.

18:18.809 --> 18:22.812
[SPEAKER_05]: was cool, but now Katamari 2 is going to expand on that, and I think that's cool.

18:23.613 --> 18:26.755
[SPEAKER_00]: So this one where you actually, to solve the level, you have to work together.

18:27.256 --> 18:27.656
[SPEAKER_05]: Very cool.

18:28.056 --> 18:29.677
[SPEAKER_05]: And you get to play as some of the cousins, too.

18:29.697 --> 18:30.038
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, you do.

18:30.058 --> 18:30.798
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is very great.

18:31.799 --> 18:38.544
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the cousins, I mean, there was all these great concepts in Katamari Namashi 1, but they didn't get to develop much of them, I think.

18:38.644 --> 18:44.809
[SPEAKER_05]: So Katamari, I think it's going to be one of those games that, it's going to be one of the big franchise games of the next decade.

18:45.297 --> 18:52.179
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to see if it expands bigger than that immediate area, if we actually end up with a world expansion as the camera moves out.

18:52.619 --> 18:53.619
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see, we'll see.

18:54.679 --> 19:00.201
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, we're getting a lot of E3 news because E3 is just around the corner, so lots and lots of E3 news.

19:00.541 --> 19:04.002
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a concert that's going to be happening before E3, the Final Fantasy concert.

19:04.062 --> 19:12.144
[SPEAKER_05]: It's More Friends, music from Final Fantasy, and announced, and I am very, very excited about this, not only are the Black Mages going to be playing...

19:12.711 --> 19:21.175
[SPEAKER_05]: But Amiko Shiratori and Riki are going to be there singing their theme songs from Final Fantasy IX and Final Fantasy X. Excellent.

19:21.215 --> 19:22.636
[SPEAKER_05]: Are going to be there singing the songs live.

19:22.856 --> 19:23.536
[SPEAKER_05]: And get this.

19:24.276 --> 19:29.619
[SPEAKER_05]: The opera from Final Fantasy VI is being performed with opera singers.

19:31.119 --> 19:32.100
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it's going to be great.

19:32.280 --> 19:33.621
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm so excited about this one.

19:33.641 --> 19:34.061
[SPEAKER_05]: Getting chills.

19:34.201 --> 19:34.561
[SPEAKER_05]: Get this.

19:35.141 --> 19:39.083
[SPEAKER_05]: Tickets still available because this is at the Universal Amphitheater.

19:39.123 --> 19:40.864
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess they changed the name to Gibson Amphitheater.

19:41.577 --> 19:42.658
[SPEAKER_05]: Formally the Universal Amphitheater.

19:42.698 --> 19:44.159
[SPEAKER_05]: Tickets are still available because it's so big.

19:44.680 --> 19:45.660
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the day before, right?

19:45.821 --> 19:46.361
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's Monday.

19:46.541 --> 19:47.182
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the Monday before.

19:47.242 --> 19:47.722
[SPEAKER_05]: May 16th.

19:48.222 --> 19:48.863
[SPEAKER_05]: Very, very soon.

19:49.383 --> 19:49.784
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotta work.

19:50.344 --> 19:50.985
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, bummer.

19:51.805 --> 19:53.086
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm really hoping that they tape it.

19:53.366 --> 19:56.649
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, this is going to be... They haven't even done this in Japan yet.

19:56.669 --> 19:57.610
[SPEAKER_05]: This is going to be huge.

19:58.350 --> 20:00.332
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope they tape it and do a DVD or something.

20:01.471 --> 20:02.452
[SPEAKER_05]: More E3 news.

20:02.832 --> 20:04.192
[SPEAKER_05]: Squeenix, we'll move on with them.

20:04.232 --> 20:06.614
[SPEAKER_05]: They announced what games are going to be showing at E3.

20:07.394 --> 20:12.516
[SPEAKER_05]: Final Fantasy VII, Dirge of Cerebrus is going to be one of their big titles that they're going to be showing.

20:13.137 --> 20:16.478
[SPEAKER_05]: Final Fantasy XII, yet again, because it didn't come out like it was supposed to.

20:17.679 --> 20:19.740
[SPEAKER_05]: Dragon Quest VIII, Journey of the Cursed King.

20:20.530 --> 20:23.052
[SPEAKER_05]: Full Metal Alchemist 2, Curse of the Crimson Elixir.

20:23.112 --> 20:25.694
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully that one's going to be better than the first one.

20:25.734 --> 20:28.376
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently curses are the big thing in the role playing games this year.

20:28.397 --> 20:28.757
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

20:29.277 --> 20:31.779
[SPEAKER_05]: Kingdom Hearts 2, I'm hoping for a playable.

20:32.380 --> 20:33.000
[SPEAKER_05]: That'd be great.

20:33.040 --> 20:34.261
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to see a playable Kingdom Hearts 2.

20:35.222 --> 20:39.105
[SPEAKER_05]: Romancing Saga, can't say I'm a fan of the Saga series.

20:39.185 --> 20:40.066
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, sorry.

20:40.086 --> 20:41.387
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried, I tried to.

20:41.727 --> 20:45.190
[SPEAKER_05]: But Front Mission Online, they're going to expand the online series.

20:45.950 --> 20:49.931
[SPEAKER_00]: Front Missions started with the Super Nintendo back when.

20:50.151 --> 20:53.732
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting enough, Squeenix is saying that they are, and we call them Squeenix.

20:53.772 --> 20:57.973
[SPEAKER_05]: We know it's Square Enix or Squeenix, but we call them Squeenix.

20:58.673 --> 21:02.074
[SPEAKER_05]: On the PC, they have Final Fantasy XI as a game they're going to be showing off.

21:02.494 --> 21:05.075
[SPEAKER_05]: Very strange, considering this game is a couple years old now.

21:05.135 --> 21:09.936
[SPEAKER_05]: So are they going to be showing off the new patches, or could there be a new expansion in the works?

21:10.176 --> 21:10.576
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope so.

21:10.596 --> 21:12.377
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's probably the new patches.

21:13.061 --> 21:17.764
[SPEAKER_03]: And from what I've heard, I know last year they had like a ballista tournament type thing going on.

21:18.065 --> 21:25.790
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is going to be the same tournament as they were having in some Hawaii location where it's kind of like a boss battle type thing.

21:26.690 --> 21:27.931
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's what they're doing with this one.

21:28.331 --> 21:28.652
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

21:29.332 --> 21:31.013
[SPEAKER_05]: Eidos announced their lineup as well.

21:31.554 --> 21:37.838
[SPEAKER_05]: What's going to be interesting is that they're going to be showing the games Hitman, Blood Money, 25 to Life, Commando Strike Force, and...

21:38.579 --> 22:07.030
[SPEAKER_05]: Laura Croft, Tomb Raider Legend I thought that they had officially said no more Tomb Raider games Nope, I saw pictures There are pictures online I think Tomb Raider is done There are pictures online and Laura Croft has bigger boobs as usual I don't doubt that it's really happening I mean Tomb Raider was such a huge franchise but I think it's kind of done I have no interest in Tomb Raider Can you guess where those pictures are at?

22:08.300 --> 22:08.480
[SPEAKER_03]: M.T.V.

22:08.500 --> 22:08.640
[SPEAKER_03]: M.T.V.

22:38.178 --> 22:38.519
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

22:38.619 --> 22:39.499
[SPEAKER_00]: Cookie Cutter TV.

22:39.800 --> 22:42.662
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that there's better sites, but who knows?

22:42.842 --> 22:45.184
[SPEAKER_05]: They might do something to impress me later on, so we'll see.

22:45.905 --> 22:46.165
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

22:47.526 --> 22:48.006
[SPEAKER_05]: I have faith.

22:50.288 --> 22:51.429
[SPEAKER_05]: E3, also one last story.

22:51.509 --> 22:57.794
[SPEAKER_05]: Yahoo is going to be doing a mobile show, and they're going to be showing Yahoo Poker.

22:57.834 --> 23:02.738
[SPEAKER_05]: They're trying to do this whole cross-platform PC mobile thing, so that should be interesting.

23:03.959 --> 23:06.502
[SPEAKER_05]: Yahoo Poker, because Texas Hold'em is the big thing right now.

23:07.677 --> 23:08.137
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll see.

23:09.198 --> 23:10.659
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, Orange Lounge Radio.

23:10.739 --> 23:21.424
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not just here to talk about gaming, but we're also here to better your life because, you know, if we talked about games all the time, we would have no time to go out and illegally gamble.

23:21.964 --> 23:24.445
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're here to better your life with some advice.

23:24.545 --> 23:27.247
[SPEAKER_05]: Who better than DarkSakura with her advice column?

23:27.267 --> 23:31.149
[SPEAKER_05]: And DarkSakura, what do you have to share with us tonight?

23:32.449 --> 23:35.491
[SPEAKER_00]: Today's bit of advice is how to wrestle free from an alligator.

23:37.839 --> 23:43.280
[SPEAKER_00]: 1.

23:38.039 --> 23:43.280
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were on land, try to get on the alligator's back and put downward pressure on its neck.

23:43.661 --> 23:45.501
[SPEAKER_00]: This will force the head and jaws down.

23:46.901 --> 23:45.501
2.

23:47.381 --> 23:48.642
[SPEAKER_00]: Close the alligator's eyes.

23:48.762 --> 23:50.422
[SPEAKER_00]: This will usually make it more sedate.

23:51.262 --> 23:50.422
3.

23:51.382 --> 23:53.183
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were attacked, go for the eyes and nose.

23:53.283 --> 23:58.264
[SPEAKER_00]: Use any weapon you have or your fist.

23:59.624 --> 24:03.025
[SPEAKER_00]: If its jaws are closed on something you want to remove, for example, a limb.

24:03.706 --> 24:05.086
[SPEAKER_00]: Tap or punch it on the snout.

24:05.207 --> 24:07.767
[SPEAKER_00]: Alligators often open their mouths when tapped lightly.

24:08.168 --> 24:12.569
[SPEAKER_00]: They may drop whatever it is they have taken hold of and back off.

24:13.069 --> 24:17.211
[SPEAKER_00]: If the alligator gets you in its jaws, you must prevent it from shaking you or rolling over.

24:17.571 --> 24:20.172
[SPEAKER_00]: These instinctual actions cause severe tissue damage.

24:20.652 --> 24:24.413
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to keep the mouth clamped shut so the alligator does not begin shaking.

24:25.453 --> 24:30.235
[SPEAKER_00]: Seek medical attention immediately, even for a small cut or bruise, to treat infection.

24:30.655 --> 24:33.176
[SPEAKER_00]: Alligators have a huge number of pathogens in their mouth.

24:34.235 --> 24:35.535
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know what I always say?

24:35.855 --> 24:36.115
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

24:36.836 --> 24:39.956
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't go freaking swimming in the swamp in Florida.

24:41.497 --> 24:42.057
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for that.

24:43.437 --> 24:44.317
[SPEAKER_05]: Always lovely advice.

24:46.798 --> 24:53.559
[SPEAKER_05]: How many of you guys know, quick survey, how many of you guys actually played Neopets previously?

24:54.000 --> 24:54.740
[SPEAKER_01]: Jamie's got her hand raised.

24:54.760 --> 24:55.540
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a long ass time ago.

24:55.560 --> 24:57.060
[SPEAKER_05]: Weren't you into Neopets for a little bit, Loki?

24:57.080 --> 24:58.361
[SPEAKER_05]: Or at least your girlfriend was, wasn't she?

24:58.501 --> 24:59.701
[SPEAKER_05]: My fiance is.

25:02.429 --> 25:03.970
[SPEAKER_05]: I played Neopets for a little while.

25:03.990 --> 25:05.030
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to think way back.

25:05.450 --> 25:10.252
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the closest thing I had that was close to Neopets would have been my Pocket Station.

25:10.872 --> 25:17.594
[SPEAKER_05]: You know that Neopets has been this slowly huge growing thing online, and now they sell this stuff at Claire's and all that stuff.

25:17.914 --> 25:23.196
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, a long time ago, Sony said that they were going to make a Neopets game, but then it just disappeared.

25:23.256 --> 25:23.977
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, guess what?

25:25.097 --> 25:28.778
[SPEAKER_05]: It's coming out now, or at least some new version of the Neopets game.

25:29.278 --> 25:29.719
[SPEAKER_05]: August of 2005...

25:31.218 --> 25:53.229
[SPEAKER_05]: Neopets, The Darkest Fairy The 3D action adventure will follow the characters as they journey through the realm of Neopia I wonder if my Neopets are dead So they're saying it's going to be a third person action adventure You know what's sad?

25:55.130 --> 26:00.193
[SPEAKER_03]: Almost practically every game coming out for the PS2 is action adventure

26:01.246 --> 26:02.467
[SPEAKER_03]: Make More Puzzle Games for the PS2 and Xbox

26:26.431 --> 26:28.552
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, here's an interesting story that ties into that.

26:28.732 --> 26:30.173
[SPEAKER_05]: And games that we used to play.

26:30.253 --> 26:31.774
[SPEAKER_05]: At least I know I did used to play this.

26:32.315 --> 26:33.595
[SPEAKER_05]: But this game got bigger and bigger.

26:33.695 --> 26:37.878
[SPEAKER_05]: Puzzle Pirates is now going to be... This used to be something you could only really get on the internet.

26:38.318 --> 26:39.299
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be in stores.

26:39.359 --> 26:40.659
[SPEAKER_05]: It's coming out in stores this week.

26:41.080 --> 26:42.000
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be on the shelves.

26:42.440 --> 26:45.062
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's kind of interesting that Puzzle Pirates kind of got bigger like that.

26:46.743 --> 26:48.044
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's going to be selling for $20.

26:49.545 --> 26:50.725
[SPEAKER_05]: Monthly subscription fee $9.95.

26:52.573 --> 26:54.194
[SPEAKER_05]: Puzzle games you can see in Puzzle Pirates.

26:54.294 --> 27:02.297
[SPEAKER_05]: Sword fighting, drinking, sailing, bilge pumping, carpentry, gunnery, distilling, and randomly they have spades in there.

27:02.757 --> 27:09.120
[SPEAKER_05]: And what's interesting about Puzzle Pirates is that it's like the Puzzle Fighter 2 inspired game, the Bejeweled inspired game.

27:10.081 --> 27:13.482
[SPEAKER_05]: But I kind of had fun with Puzzle Pirates when I played it.

27:14.022 --> 27:20.685
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought the interface needed work, but again, before I get the hate mail from the Puzzle Pirates community, it was like two years ago and they were still baiting it when I played it.

27:20.973 --> 27:25.035
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm sure a lot's changed and it's probably polished now, so I probably should go back and check it out.

27:26.396 --> 27:28.337
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm glad the game's been successful.

27:28.457 --> 27:29.798
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was a neat idea.

27:30.438 --> 27:32.259
[SPEAKER_05]: But people are going way too far with the pirate thing.

27:32.339 --> 27:34.780
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, they have conventions where they all go and they dress up as pirates.

27:35.020 --> 27:35.240
[SPEAKER_00]: Arr!

27:35.440 --> 27:36.141
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

27:36.161 --> 27:38.262
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost scary like some of the furry stuff.

27:38.322 --> 27:40.043
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, worship Johnny Depp and stuff.

27:40.063 --> 27:40.363
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

27:44.642 --> 27:46.823
[SPEAKER_05]: Movie Studios and their UMDs.

27:46.883 --> 27:48.683
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, the UMDs are getting bigger and bigger.

27:48.803 --> 27:59.767
[SPEAKER_05]: Fox is very, very close to committing, and the rumor is saying that their lineup would initially include Dodgeball, iRobot, Super Troopers, Predator, and Napoleon Dynamite.

28:00.527 --> 28:01.388
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, that's cool.

28:01.668 --> 28:03.108
[SPEAKER_05]: Universal, thinking about it.

28:03.228 --> 28:06.410
[SPEAKER_05]: Paramount is investigating it right now.

28:06.510 --> 28:09.851
[SPEAKER_05]: So UMDs look like it could be taking off.

28:10.271 --> 28:10.551
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't know.

28:10.922 --> 28:12.423
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, I'd say you're the expert on this.

28:12.443 --> 28:13.104
[SPEAKER_05]: This is your industry.

28:13.144 --> 28:14.185
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think?

28:14.205 --> 28:16.006
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, they're trying to go this route.

28:16.406 --> 28:18.368
[SPEAKER_03]: They're trying to push this stuff way too much.

28:18.548 --> 28:20.269
[SPEAKER_03]: I have not seen sales figures on UMD.

28:20.309 --> 28:21.290
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it really doing that well?

28:22.010 --> 28:23.251
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, to be honest.

28:23.331 --> 28:26.514
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I haven't really had anyone requesting UMD movies.

28:26.674 --> 28:37.282
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just trying to push it on these people, but honestly... See, because as far as PSPs go, rental-wise, there's not that many stores renting games for that stuff right now.

28:37.742 --> 28:38.663
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they're...

28:39.401 --> 28:39.961
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

28:56.736 --> 28:58.757
[SPEAKER_03]: that you have a DVD for.

28:58.797 --> 28:59.457
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't get it either.

28:59.577 --> 29:00.177
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't get it.

29:00.337 --> 29:03.438
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they're looking for the portable convenience, but you know what?

29:03.458 --> 29:04.658
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got portable convenience.

29:04.718 --> 29:06.439
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a laptop.

29:06.899 --> 29:11.940
[SPEAKER_03]: The only way I can think that this would be probably better is those people that buy portable DVD players.

29:13.260 --> 29:17.241
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you can buy PSP for your kids because they're all, Mommy, Mommy, I want it!

29:17.421 --> 29:19.802
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they have the movies, too, that they can watch.

29:20.242 --> 29:24.163
[SPEAKER_03]: But nowadays, too, you also have all these SUVs and stuff with TVs in their car.

29:25.155 --> 29:30.120
[SPEAKER_03]: Really, what it comes down to is kids need to learn to sit still and shut up and sleep during car rides.

29:30.280 --> 29:38.828
[SPEAKER_03]: I have not heard anything about sales figures on the... I don't know how well they're doing, but apparently, I think... I don't know if it's going to take off, though.

29:38.968 --> 29:42.592
[SPEAKER_03]: I really... I'm really worrying about this.

29:42.612 --> 29:43.913
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, because it's just like people...

29:44.366 --> 29:51.031
[SPEAKER_03]: We're telling me months back, yeah, DVHS is gonna be the revolution, it's gonna hit the video industry, boo!

29:51.611 --> 29:55.654
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said from day one, I'm like, this thing is gonna fail faster than Laserdisc.

29:56.314 --> 29:59.577
[SPEAKER_03]: And watch, and guess what?

30:00.537 --> 30:01.858
[SPEAKER_03]: DVHS, what's that?

30:02.018 --> 30:04.140
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's right, it's not being made anymore.

30:04.850 --> 30:06.671
[SPEAKER_05]: I would really like to hear from our listeners.

30:06.751 --> 30:10.814
[SPEAKER_05]: If you are somebody who is supporting the UMD and you're buying movies on UMD, we want to know why.

30:11.134 --> 30:13.336
[SPEAKER_05]: Send us an email, 2go at orangelawnradio.com.

30:13.596 --> 30:16.098
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm not, you know, we're not trying to say, like, oh, you're a bad person for doing it.

30:16.118 --> 30:17.579
[SPEAKER_05]: We just want to know, you know, what's the draw?

30:17.599 --> 30:18.339
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the appeal to you?

30:18.399 --> 30:18.980
[SPEAKER_05]: Because we don't see it.

30:19.020 --> 30:23.162
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I got Spider-Man 2 with my PSP because I got the neat little bundle thing.

30:24.383 --> 30:27.225
[SPEAKER_03]: I would never see myself actually buying this or paying for this.

30:28.226 --> 30:30.787
[SPEAKER_03]: And it really, I don't know.

30:30.827 --> 30:33.009
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just not anything I would spend money on.

30:34.470 --> 30:34.630
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

30:36.642 --> 30:38.003
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, did you have anything you wanted to add?

30:38.563 --> 30:41.646
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm actually looking for the sales figures.

30:41.706 --> 30:46.410
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that there would be a financial report out already, but I haven't found one yet.

30:46.510 --> 30:48.131
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I'm sure we'll see something on the next show.

30:48.151 --> 30:49.793
[SPEAKER_03]: Studios, here's what you need to be doing.

30:49.993 --> 30:52.115
[SPEAKER_03]: And trust me, this is the greatest idea right here.

30:52.675 --> 31:01.463
[SPEAKER_03]: Because everybody, at least this is what I've been using my large memory stick for, TV episodes.

31:02.589 --> 31:03.009
[SPEAKER_03]: and so on.

31:28.170 --> 31:32.112
[SPEAKER_03]: 15 minutes, I watch my robot chickens, and I watch my family guy.

31:32.612 --> 31:33.132
[SPEAKER_03]: And there you go.

31:33.192 --> 31:36.214
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just enough time to sit down and watch this really quick.

31:36.314 --> 31:37.294
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, I see where you're going with that.

31:37.414 --> 31:38.215
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, okay.

31:38.675 --> 31:39.255
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting idea.

31:39.775 --> 31:40.976
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I think they need to be doing.

31:41.016 --> 31:44.558
[SPEAKER_03]: TV shows instead of movies in UMD format.

31:44.598 --> 31:45.858
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the internet's doing it already.

31:46.118 --> 31:47.559
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you just said, you've already done it.

31:48.089 --> 31:50.010
[SPEAKER_05]: The Silent Hill Movie has begun filming.

32:16.933 --> 32:19.934
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

32:38.317 --> 32:44.383
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the scenes from the actual game are showing up in the movie, so they're definitely having that tie.

32:44.423 --> 32:50.468
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, it's actually already looking better to be better associated with the universe than, say, the Resident Evil movies were.

32:50.888 --> 32:52.290
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's looking very good so far.

32:52.330 --> 32:54.271
[SPEAKER_00]: They've definitely got the feel down.

32:55.372 --> 33:04.561
[SPEAKER_00]: So far on the cast they have, I guess it's pronounced Radha Mitchell from Finding Neverland as Rose, who is the main character.

33:05.260 --> 33:07.201
[SPEAKER_00]: As her daughter, they have Jodell Ferlin.

33:07.241 --> 33:11.422
[SPEAKER_00]: And as her husband, they have Sean Bean, who was Boromir in Fellowship of the Rings.

33:11.682 --> 33:13.362
[SPEAKER_05]: And Yui Bull is not directing this, right?

33:13.702 --> 33:13.962
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, no.

33:14.242 --> 33:14.562
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, no.

33:14.582 --> 33:14.922
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, phew.

33:15.262 --> 33:15.523
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, no.

33:16.483 --> 33:18.363
[SPEAKER_00]: I had who it was a moment ago.

33:18.463 --> 33:20.364
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to say it was the guy that did Brotherhood of the Wolf.

33:20.444 --> 33:21.264
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you're correct.

33:21.284 --> 33:22.584
[SPEAKER_05]: Kristoff something.

33:23.404 --> 33:23.664
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

33:24.605 --> 33:29.106
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I really have high hopes for this.

33:29.286 --> 33:32.687
[SPEAKER_05]: And I hope, I kind of hope that Akira Yamaoka gets to do the music.

33:32.747 --> 33:33.927
[SPEAKER_00]: To really keep it up, yeah.

33:36.122 --> 33:39.624
[SPEAKER_05]: Christoph Gans is the director.

33:42.486 --> 33:44.067
[SPEAKER_00]: Production company Davis Films.

33:46.629 --> 33:48.030
[SPEAKER_00]: Roger Avery is the scripting.

33:48.670 --> 33:52.893
[SPEAKER_00]: Makeup by Paul Jones, who did Resident Evil Apocalypse.

33:53.654 --> 33:54.855
[SPEAKER_00]: But he's doing the gore effects.

33:55.075 --> 33:59.718
[SPEAKER_00]: And the guy who did Underworld is doing the creatures.

34:00.526 --> 34:05.470
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I guess, although I don't know how much I'd want this movie to have in common with Underworld.

34:05.490 --> 34:08.713
[SPEAKER_00]: The budget at present is $45 to $50 million.

34:08.733 --> 34:10.414
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a lot of faith in this movie.

34:10.434 --> 34:12.877
[SPEAKER_00]: That's about $25,000 a day for production.

34:14.778 --> 34:15.879
[SPEAKER_05]: I have high hopes for this movie.

34:15.899 --> 34:17.761
[SPEAKER_05]: I really hope they get it right.

34:18.581 --> 34:21.184
[SPEAKER_03]: Really, we need a good video game movie.

34:21.204 --> 34:22.164
[SPEAKER_05]: We really do.

34:22.365 --> 34:24.106
[SPEAKER_05]: Please don't screw this up, you guys.

34:24.566 --> 34:25.127
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty please.

34:25.592 --> 34:26.513
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for watching!

34:39.827 --> 34:40.567
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's wrap it up.

34:40.868 --> 34:43.149
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go around and give everybody's final words for tonight.

34:43.209 --> 34:44.329
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, one last thing I did want to add.

34:44.710 --> 34:48.692
[SPEAKER_05]: If you notice our sound is a little bit different tonight, that's because we're actually in a new studio.

34:49.092 --> 34:51.153
[SPEAKER_05]: So we had to kind of redo everything.

34:51.473 --> 34:52.834
[SPEAKER_05]: We went through a move here locally.

34:53.674 --> 34:54.995
[SPEAKER_05]: So we redid all our chords.

34:55.015 --> 34:56.356
[SPEAKER_05]: So our sound is a little different.

34:57.036 --> 34:58.037
[SPEAKER_05]: Tell us what you guys think.

34:58.197 --> 34:59.898
[SPEAKER_05]: If you think we should tweak it or whatever.

35:00.398 --> 35:02.119
[SPEAKER_05]: 2go at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.

35:02.159 --> 35:02.799
[SPEAKER_05]: T-O-G-O.

35:03.140 --> 35:06.301
[SPEAKER_00]: So you thought that you got rid of something from the old studio.

35:06.401 --> 35:07.502
[SPEAKER_05]: No, you found it, didn't you?

35:09.063 --> 35:10.263
[SPEAKER_05]: A little stuffed ferret.

35:10.863 --> 35:11.303
[SPEAKER_05]: Hooray.

35:11.463 --> 35:13.184
[SPEAKER_00]: They found a way back.

35:13.944 --> 35:16.164
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought I buried that in the deepest, darkest box.

35:16.244 --> 35:16.804
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, anyway.

35:17.505 --> 35:18.665
[SPEAKER_03]: Final thoughts, Loki.

35:19.405 --> 35:24.226
[SPEAKER_03]: I forgot to mention this on the three-hour show that we do, but here's something I'd like to mention.

35:24.246 --> 35:25.186
[SPEAKER_03]: Fine.

35:25.386 --> 35:30.847
[SPEAKER_03]: I went to see the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, the movie that came out recently, and there's people wearing towels.

35:31.327 --> 35:37.648
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, granted, I know that this is part of the book, and people, you know, they're fans of the book, and they want to dress up for stuff.

35:38.342 --> 35:40.143
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a big problem with this.

35:40.543 --> 35:41.643
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a movie.

35:41.743 --> 35:43.024
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a convention.

35:43.104 --> 35:44.564
[SPEAKER_03]: It does not require cosplay.

35:44.664 --> 35:47.105
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate the people that dress up like Star Wars characters.

35:47.145 --> 35:47.626
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, wait a minute.

35:47.666 --> 35:52.107
[SPEAKER_03]: As someone who did Rocky Horror Picture Show a couple times... Okay, there's a little difference.

35:52.307 --> 35:56.429
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a difference between participating in the movie and going to watch a movie in costume.

35:56.509 --> 35:57.509
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, that's a little different.

35:58.370 --> 36:00.390
[SPEAKER_05]: Star Wars is not a participation movie.

36:00.430 --> 36:01.791
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's not a participation movie.

36:01.811 --> 36:06.953
[SPEAKER_03]: And all these people dress up and they're in character and stuff like that.

36:07.349 --> 36:12.671
[SPEAKER_03]: and I have problems with that, the Matrix people and the Lord of the Rings people because you all do this.

36:12.751 --> 36:15.492
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have the Star Wars people with their lightsabers.

36:15.872 --> 36:16.312
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

36:16.452 --> 36:18.372
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate these people and they're so annoying.

36:18.693 --> 36:22.914
[SPEAKER_03]: They are goddamn annoying and they just, ugh.

36:22.954 --> 36:23.514
[SPEAKER_05]: They bug me.

36:23.614 --> 36:30.536
[SPEAKER_05]: The hardcore people ruined the Phantom Menace for me because they cheered at every reference and I was missing dialogue because they just would not be quiet.

36:30.696 --> 36:32.237
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have to say something in their favor.

36:32.397 --> 36:32.657
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

36:33.297 --> 36:35.918
[SPEAKER_00]: When we were in line for the Phantom Menace, it's actually better than the movie.

36:36.596 --> 36:39.638
[SPEAKER_00]: This was at the theater in Roseville with the trees everywhere.

36:40.059 --> 36:46.123
[SPEAKER_00]: And people pulled out of line, brought out their lightsabers, and had an impromptu duel under the trees with the lights behind them.

36:46.163 --> 36:48.685
[SPEAKER_00]: So all you saw was their silhouettes and the glowing lightsaber.

36:49.285 --> 36:50.346
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was better than the movie.

36:51.267 --> 36:53.549
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to admit, though, that's pretty geeky.

36:53.569 --> 36:55.230
[SPEAKER_00]: That was geeky, but it was awesome.

36:55.270 --> 36:57.151
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think either one of them got laid that night?

36:57.972 --> 36:58.432
[SPEAKER_00]: Who cares?

36:58.472 --> 36:59.273
[SPEAKER_00]: They were cool for five minutes.

36:59.293 --> 37:00.133
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I love?

37:00.574 --> 37:01.935
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the people that wait in line.

37:02.858 --> 37:05.639
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, your final thought My final thought is I have a headache

37:31.960 --> 37:57.008
