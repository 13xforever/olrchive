00:19.000 --> 00:21.000
Hello, everybody, again for another week.

00:21.000 --> 00:25.000
We are here with the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition,

00:25.000 --> 00:29.000
our podcast dedicated to what's going on in the gamer world.

00:29.000 --> 00:33.100
this is information the gamers really want to know about and you know this

00:33.100 --> 00:39.020
week we're famous famous famous do you know me I am so famous my name is Rob

00:39.020 --> 00:41.720
Roberts you might know me as sky the famous voices you hear behind me is the

00:41.720 --> 00:45.620
lovely dark Sakura no it's Jamie Summers because I'm an internet celebrity and

00:45.620 --> 00:51.800
the one and only Loki just call me the foot yes our egos are a little big this

00:51.800 --> 00:54.940
week because we were in the local paper they did a nice lovely article on

00:54.940 --> 00:59.980
Podcasting and we were one of the three podcasts from the area featured in it. We were very happy

01:00.840 --> 01:03.520
Except for Loki because all they showed was a picture of his foot

01:04.720 --> 01:07.600
Because we were playing DDR for those of you guys haven't seen the article

01:07.600 --> 01:12.360
It's it's it's it has a picture of Loki playing DDR while we're taping

01:12.360 --> 01:17.400
It's actually the articles a little bit of a stretch because it says it's about the podcast

01:17.400 --> 01:20.180
But they actually took pictures while we were taping our three-hour program

01:20.180 --> 01:25.360
So, um, Loki was playing DDR and we were commenting on it and you can see, uh, DarkSakura sitting

01:25.360 --> 01:29.180
on our laptop looking on and I'm just saying something, I don't know, and then you see

01:29.180 --> 01:30.180
Loki's foot.

01:30.180 --> 01:31.180
This is kind of funny.

01:31.180 --> 01:32.180
The precious.

01:32.180 --> 01:33.180
Not the foot.

01:33.180 --> 01:34.180
The foot's not the precious.

01:34.180 --> 01:35.180
No, the laptop's the precious.

01:35.180 --> 01:36.180
It's the laptop.

01:36.180 --> 01:37.180
But, uh, yeah.

01:37.180 --> 01:41.180
At least, you know, they picked the most toned part of my body to take a picture of my foot.

01:41.180 --> 01:44.160
Although your feet were kind of curving funny, that was very interesting.

01:44.160 --> 01:47.820
I don't know what happened there, I was just, I don't know.

01:47.820 --> 01:51.960
So big thanks to SACB for filling our media horror ego.

01:51.960 --> 01:53.220
We do love that.

01:53.220 --> 01:57.880
And if anybody else wants to help us inflate our media horror ego, send us a message.

01:57.880 --> 01:58.880
ToGo.

01:58.880 --> 01:59.880
T-O-G-O.

01:59.880 --> 02:03.600
They sold six more papers the other day.

02:03.600 --> 02:09.140
Also did you guys know that last week we were OneUp.com's audio blog of the day at some

02:09.140 --> 02:10.140
point last week?

02:10.140 --> 02:12.060
We're even more of an internet celebrity now.

02:12.060 --> 02:13.060
That was just awesome.

02:13.060 --> 02:14.940
So thank you guys over at OneUp.com.

02:14.940 --> 02:17.300
I think OneUp.com is a neat idea.

02:17.300 --> 02:20.920
I love their community stuff, and I'm not just saying that because they, you know, made

02:20.920 --> 02:21.920
this audio blog of the day.

02:21.920 --> 02:24.520
I've actually been a member of the community for longer, so.

02:24.520 --> 02:25.520
But it's neat.

02:25.520 --> 02:26.720
I was very happy about that.

02:26.720 --> 02:27.960
It's nice to be respected by your peers.

02:27.960 --> 02:30.960
Well, you know, with all these blogs and everything, I'm thinking about starting up a new one on

02:30.960 --> 02:31.960
MySpace.

02:31.960 --> 02:32.960
Oh, okay.

02:32.960 --> 02:34.480
Starting up the Orange Lounge on MySpace.

02:34.480 --> 02:37.840
You know, actually, I just found out today at orangeloungeradio.com, we have the capability

02:37.840 --> 02:39.080
to do blogs there.

02:39.080 --> 02:40.360
We just don't.

02:40.360 --> 02:41.880
So I don't know, we may have to do something.

02:41.880 --> 02:42.880
We'll see, though.

02:42.880 --> 02:43.880
We'll see.

02:43.880 --> 02:45.520
Anyway, enough about us inflating our egos.

02:45.520 --> 02:49.520

02:49.520 --> 02:53.440

like to score big oh who doesn't all right anyway on to the games we've only

03:08.280 --> 03:12.160
got a half hour so let's talk about the games Dark Sakura I know it's been a

03:12.160 --> 03:16.160
crazy week for you and you got a lot of stuff going on but have you managed to

03:16.160 --> 03:21.700
get any gaming done during your week this week no not really just

03:21.700 --> 03:24.200
unfortunately had a lot of stuff going on the person I've had lots of real-life

03:24.200 --> 03:32.080
drama going on so I've been focusing on that no I did play a little luminous but

03:32.080 --> 03:37.700
I watched Dan beat Metal Gear acid okay how was that he said that game was

03:37.700 --> 03:41.260
trippy and hard what do you think of Metal Gear acid compared to with the

03:41.260 --> 03:48.260
I'm not into card games, and I'm not into strategy games. It's more like a real-time strategy, and I don't like those type of things.

03:48.260 --> 03:55.260
So, you know, you're, please welcome to it. If you like Fire Emblem, and, like, Metal Gear, you'll like this game.

03:56.260 --> 03:57.260
Fair enough.

03:57.260 --> 03:58.260
That's really it.

03:58.260 --> 03:59.260
Loki, how about you?

03:59.260 --> 04:05.260
First, I'd like to say, Metal Gear Acid reminds me of Phantasy Star, was it a 4? Phantasy Star Online 4?

04:05.260 --> 04:07.260
Uh, it was a volume 3.

04:07.260 --> 04:08.260
Volume 3.

04:08.260 --> 04:13.240
Yes, the card game. We all remember how that worked. Well, it worked about just the same

04:13.240 --> 04:13.920
for Mellow Your Eyes.

04:13.920 --> 04:17.460
Funny enough with Phantasy Star IV, now they're going back to what worked in 1 and 2. Funny

04:17.460 --> 04:17.940
enough.

04:17.940 --> 04:24.540
Yeah, yeah. The card game thing? Ah, you know what? Buy cards. If you're going to play a

04:24.540 --> 04:29.480
card game, play a card game. Don't play a game that's a video game that's a card game.

04:29.480 --> 04:36.480
That's just redundant. That's too much. Anyways, my week, I played one game and that one game

04:36.480 --> 04:43.480
would be Ridge Racer for the PSP. And I went through about, oh man, like 13 of the World

04:45.880 --> 04:52.880
Tour things. I'm now on pro 20 I think. And I just unlocked the Rally-X car by beating

04:54.960 --> 04:59.680
the minigame. We got 50,000 points on that. So I got the Rally-X car which is so awesome

04:59.680 --> 05:04.200
because the Rally-X car is all pixelated just like, you know, the actual game. And when

05:04.200 --> 05:08.160
you use the nitro boost, it does these little pixelated clouds behind you.

05:08.160 --> 05:10.920
Oh, just like it did in rally X if you played the old school game.

05:10.920 --> 05:11.920
Yeah, like the smokescreen.

05:11.920 --> 05:19.040
And that was, I think, it's just little details like that Namco throws in, it's awesome.

05:19.040 --> 05:23.480
The race before that had the race, what they called, I guess the devil car or something

05:23.480 --> 05:24.760
like that.

05:24.760 --> 05:25.760
And that sucked.

05:25.760 --> 05:26.760
It was a one-on-one race.

05:26.760 --> 05:30.920
But see, what's really awesome is once you get past pro 18, it's all like kind of challenge

05:30.920 --> 05:35.960
mode type stuff where you have like one-on-one races with stuff to unlock special cars and

05:35.960 --> 05:40.520
whatnot and those are really cool i've been playing this game like all week i mean it's

05:40.520 --> 05:46.120
held my attention that long it's just really really good game cool anything else then um

05:46.920 --> 05:51.720
you know that's all i played this week i haven't played anything else um i have kind of a different

05:51.720 --> 05:57.080
story than you do for my gaming week uh you were on psp i was on ds i picked up a new game called

05:57.080 --> 06:01.640
Polarium for the DS. It's a puzzle game. I'm looking at that one too. Were you looking at that?

06:01.640 --> 06:07.040
That and Mercury for PSV. I picked up Polarium because I'm a big puzzle game fan. I like those

06:07.040 --> 06:12.240
kinds. I love Luminous and you know this goes back to Tetris, Yoshi's Cookie and

06:12.240 --> 06:16.640
Tetris Attack and those types of games too. So I picked up Polarium which is

06:16.640 --> 06:21.660
basically the concept of Polarium is that you have all these squares so at

06:21.660 --> 06:24.280
first glance you might think it's kind of like Luminous but has nothing to do

06:24.280 --> 06:27.080
with it really their games aren't the same at all but you use the stylus you

06:27.080 --> 06:31.400
draw lines and that's how you you're changing you're swapping tiles and I

06:31.400 --> 06:34.480
know that sounds really simple but because you can only draw the lines so

06:34.480 --> 06:37.760
fast you actually have to think ahead about how you're gonna draw the lines so

06:37.760 --> 06:41.880
it sounds like a pretty killer concept huh I polarium held my attention for

06:41.880 --> 06:45.720
about an hour and then I was done with it I was very disappointed with polarium

06:45.720 --> 06:51.560
that's just me personally I thought the graphics were boring as heck I thought

06:51.560 --> 06:56.060
the sound it sounded like garbage I thought the puzzles were kind of

06:56.060 --> 07:01.180
interesting but I just didn't like the concept I mean I take that back I like

07:01.180 --> 07:05.220
the idea of the game it kind of makes you go could this be a fun puzzle game

07:05.220 --> 07:09.100
but the execution didn't like it I can't recommend this game I don't like it at

07:09.100 --> 07:13.060
all especially when you put it next to a game such as luminous you know and I

07:13.060 --> 07:17.380
think this might be in some ways DS's answer to luminous but if you think of

07:17.380 --> 07:21.280
it that way you're really gonna be disappointed this is nothing I think

07:21.280 --> 07:25.080
mercury is also gonna blow it out of the water to luminous the bar has been set

07:25.080 --> 07:29.320
so high with luminous I think I did I'm thinking that mercury is gonna be pretty

07:29.320 --> 07:33.320
big though I'm curious about mercury I'm also curious about I'm not giving up on

07:33.320 --> 07:36.000
DS just yet because I'm very very curious about medios I've heard a lot of

07:36.000 --> 07:40.300
good things about that I just want smart bomb that's what I've been waiting for

07:40.300 --> 07:44.800
polarium was just polarium is the type of game I would have expected like you

07:44.800 --> 07:46.800
You know how they have like third-party publishers?

07:46.800 --> 07:51.240
Like I always expected Plarium to come out like from a fourth-party publisher on the

07:51.240 --> 07:52.240
Super Nintendo.

07:52.240 --> 07:53.560
That's what I did the graphics for.

07:53.560 --> 07:56.800
Honestly, some of these games for the DS are starting to be like rushed.

07:56.800 --> 07:58.440
Plarium felt like a tech demo.

07:58.440 --> 07:59.440
It did.

07:59.440 --> 08:00.440
It seriously, it's like rushed.

08:00.440 --> 08:01.440
It's like Zookeeper.

08:01.440 --> 08:02.440
Come on now.

08:02.440 --> 08:04.040
It's a flash game that they threw on the DS.

08:04.040 --> 08:06.320
That is like a dumb excuse.

08:06.320 --> 08:09.840
Hey, they actually put Snood on the Game Boy Advance.

08:09.840 --> 08:14.560
DS is going to lose this battle unless things start changing fast.

08:14.560 --> 08:16.120
These games are not impressive, they're not.

08:16.120 --> 08:20.560
I know at E3 they're going to announce that stupid internet connectivity or whatever like

08:20.560 --> 08:21.560
that.

08:21.560 --> 08:22.560
We think, but...

08:22.560 --> 08:26.000
It's pretty solid that's what's going to happen.

08:26.000 --> 08:30.800
I don't think it's going to matter at this point because pretty soon, what is it, the

08:30.800 --> 08:35.120
PSP's already got internet connectivity and they're going to have a web browser probably

08:35.120 --> 08:36.600
for that coming out this year.

08:36.600 --> 08:44.680
If the revolution blows everything else out of the water, does the DS have a chance?

08:44.680 --> 08:45.680
I don't know.

08:45.680 --> 08:50.200
They're going to probably do a redesign of it just like they did with Advance and it's

08:50.200 --> 08:52.200
going to be another game system to buy.

08:52.200 --> 08:55.460
All they need to do is start putting out some more of their franchise games that are good.

08:55.460 --> 08:57.400
Like the Metroid demo was pretty nice.

08:57.400 --> 08:59.200
They should put out the Metroid game.

08:59.200 --> 09:01.240
I know they're probably trying to finish it, but...

09:01.240 --> 09:02.240
Okay, okay.

09:02.240 --> 09:03.240
Here's what I don't understand.

09:03.240 --> 09:09.160
ported Mario 64, good for you, um, why didn't you make a new Mario game? I mean, that's

09:09.160 --> 09:13.800
why I'm wondering, why didn't you make a new game? I mean, that's what they did. Well,

09:13.800 --> 09:16.960
I mean, they altered Mario 64, so it's almost like a whole different game when you play

09:16.960 --> 09:20.280
Yoshi and stuff. Look at the game, Wade Manso, that's all it was for the most part, is ported

09:20.280 --> 09:25.640
games. I've already got Pac-Pix out in Japan, and that's not fair. Pac-Pix is coming out

09:25.640 --> 09:30.400
here very, very soon though, which is exciting. Alright, let's, no, let's go, I'm sorry. Actually,

09:30.400 --> 09:35.640
still want the pac-man marble madness type game that needs to hurry up and a

09:35.640 --> 09:39.160
once more for our listener oh that's right we talked about this on show a

09:39.160 --> 09:42.440
couple weeks ago the pack and roll one yeah we definitely need that soon the

09:42.440 --> 09:46.680
lack of marble madness in the world soon I want to stop tonight's gaming news

09:46.680 --> 09:49.240
actually talking about the revolution because there's a big rumor going around

09:49.240 --> 09:52.240
about revolution right now this is actually slash dotted earlier this week

09:52.240 --> 09:57.440
from games slash dot org and they say that actually IGN I guess they're in

09:57.440 --> 10:03.800
turn reporting this. They saying that this person Brooke Burgess of Broken

10:03.800 --> 10:07.600
Saints has said something about the Nintendo Revolution console and this is

10:07.600 --> 10:15.240
that 3D projection is the big revolution. It's 3D projecting and yes

10:15.240 --> 10:20.680
it's just like it sounds. It's gonna project images in 3D. Virtual Boy part 2?

10:20.680 --> 10:23.860
I know that was the first thing I thought of too is like didn't the Virtual

10:23.860 --> 10:28.180
boy fail miserably? You mean the great red headache machine?

10:28.180 --> 10:31.820
Pretty much! Let's have a migraine! You can pay 30 bucks for it!

10:31.820 --> 10:36.200
The Virtual Boy was kind of a cool idea though. I mean, it really was. But that's the first

10:36.200 --> 10:38.420
thing my brain goes to when I hear about this revolution.

10:38.420 --> 10:43.260
It was a good idea too early in its time. It had fun commercials.

10:43.260 --> 10:48.380
The Virtual Boy, it was a great idea. Monochrome red, that was a bad point. And the fact that

10:48.380 --> 10:52.220
it wasn't really that much of a portable machine, you had to kind of like sit it down on a table

10:52.220 --> 10:55.920
to be able to use it. So that was the problem.

10:55.920 --> 11:02.920
Now before you laugh this story off, consider that, and this is what the article goes on

11:03.100 --> 11:07.080
to say, consider that there have been recent patents filed by Nintendo that kind of support

11:07.080 --> 11:11.640
that this is possibly the direction. Obviously nothing is confirmed until Nintendo says something

11:11.640 --> 11:13.160
themselves, but speculatively...

11:13.160 --> 11:18.120
I am going to say that this is probably the case, and here's why I think that. They have

11:18.120 --> 11:22.040
been very quiet about the revolution. They haven't said anything, and this is what's

11:22.040 --> 11:26.160
gonna happen. You're gonna have all this, like, you know, everyone's like, oh, PS3,

11:26.160 --> 11:33.160
you know, Xbox 360. Then it's all BAM! Revolution. Because the Xbox 360 and the PS3, as far as

11:33.160 --> 11:41.840
you know, improving the graphics and stuff, they haven't really done anything new. But

11:41.840 --> 11:45.840
it's also, Nintendo's been known for gimmicky type of things.

11:45.840 --> 11:50.400
It'll be interesting, I'm looking forward to seeing if this is true or not and how this

11:50.400 --> 11:55.140
is all gonna play out.

11:55.140 --> 11:57.460
It's hard to say until I see it in action, you know what I mean?

11:57.460 --> 12:01.100
The concept sounds interesting, although I really hope they've learned the mistakes from

12:01.100 --> 12:04.120
Virtual Boy and that this won't cause seizures and headaches, but...

12:04.120 --> 12:08.200
I'm wondering if this new 3D stuff, if we'll see a Power Girl 2?

12:08.200 --> 12:10.040
We'll see.

12:10.040 --> 12:17.300
know that Nintendo licensed the Palm OS. Yeah, actually there's a note they're

12:17.300 --> 12:21.260
supposed to be making a cartridge to where you can run the Palm OS software

12:21.260 --> 12:25.340
on your DS. It's gonna be very interesting to see how the DS and the Revolution

12:25.340 --> 12:28.340
work together if the 3D projection thing is cool. Will I be able to poke things with

12:28.340 --> 12:32.980
my stylus? No, basically what the 3D projection is it's gonna be

12:32.980 --> 12:36.800
stereoscopic 3D basically just like if you go into an IMAX movie and you have

12:36.800 --> 12:41.640
your glasses that's what you're gonna get with this it's gonna be 3d with

12:41.640 --> 12:45.160
glasses I think so you're talking about 3d glasses not actual like hologram

12:45.160 --> 12:50.780
projection I think we're a little I think we're a little early for but that

12:50.780 --> 12:53.920
would be revolutionary would it not yeah I would but then though I guess would

12:53.920 --> 12:56.960
that mean that would not need a TV for that or something I don't know I don't

12:56.960 --> 13:00.800
know we'll see whatever I mean hey and whatever they want to do I mean if

13:00.800 --> 13:05.240
they've got you know holograms hey um since Namco got brought up a little

13:05.240 --> 13:08.600
earlier in the show several times. I have a couple Namco stories tonight and I

13:08.600 --> 13:13.280
know this always makes Dark Soccer happy because she's a big Namco fan. What is

13:13.280 --> 13:17.880
happening is that Namco is going to be releasing a brand new compilation, yes

13:17.880 --> 13:23.680
another one, for their 50th anniversary. They are collecting 14 arcade titles and

13:23.680 --> 13:29.320
putting it out on PS2, GameCube, Xbox, PC, and GBA. It's coming out in August and

13:29.320 --> 13:34.760
it's called the 50th Anniversary Arcade Collection. Pac-Man, Ms. Pac-Man, Galaga,

13:34.760 --> 13:40.620
Galaxian, Dig Dug, Pole Positions 1 and 2, Rally-X, Rolling Thunder, and more, including

13:40.620 --> 13:42.960
Xevious, Mappy, etc, etc.

13:42.960 --> 13:43.960
Mappy!

13:43.960 --> 13:45.800
Been there, done that, with all this?

13:45.800 --> 13:46.800
Mappy!

13:46.800 --> 13:48.640
Why can't I just go out and get the PlayStation 1 discs?

13:48.640 --> 13:49.640
I mean, what-

13:49.640 --> 13:50.640
Well, they need to-

13:50.640 --> 13:51.640
Big deal.

13:51.640 --> 13:52.640
They need to do what SEGA did.

13:52.640 --> 13:53.640
And-

13:53.640 --> 13:54.640
Like, with the SEGA ages.

13:54.640 --> 13:56.440
A lot of people were disappointed in SEGA ages, though.

13:56.440 --> 13:59.320
A lot of people were stupid.

13:59.320 --> 14:04.680
I don't need Rally-X. Rally-X is part of, um, Ridge Racer for the PSV.

14:04.680 --> 14:10.500
I could put in Tekken 5 and play Starblade until I'm giddy, which I'm already giddy.

14:10.500 --> 14:16.060
I'm a huge retro fan, don't get me wrong, but this is thoroughly uninteresting to me.

14:16.060 --> 14:20.140
I don't know, they could do all the interviews in the world they want to, but I feel like

14:20.140 --> 14:24.820
I did this already ten years ago when the PlayStation came out, and these games are

14:24.820 --> 14:30.260
great and they hold a space in the arcade game greats of all time, but I'm just not

14:30.260 --> 14:31.260
interested in playing them again.

14:31.260 --> 14:38.220
another another retro story okay sure actually this is now all you might

14:38.220 --> 14:42.540
remember those wonderful you know the straight you hook them up to the TV type

14:42.540 --> 14:47.620
of console systems the flashbacks what they call them oh sure sure yeah okay

14:47.620 --> 14:51.060
well they're coming out with the flashback 2.0 mm-hmm and so I'm gonna

14:51.060 --> 14:56.540
basically have more 2600 games including asteroids breakout centipede lunar

14:56.540 --> 15:02.980
Lander, Millipede, Missile Command, and Pong, but amongst three others total.

15:02.980 --> 15:07.780
Now the flashbacks are the actual console, not the like joystick that you plug in.

15:07.780 --> 15:08.780
It looks like the old Atari.

15:08.780 --> 15:09.860
It looks like a console.

15:09.860 --> 15:13.120
This one though, it's going to be great because it's going to be wood grain, just like the

15:13.120 --> 15:14.120
old ones.

15:14.120 --> 15:15.120
Alright!

15:15.120 --> 15:18.660
We were just talking about this because I remember we were talking about the Atari contest

15:18.660 --> 15:23.300
and that game Ninja Garden that got created in 24 hours is going to be in this, at least

15:23.300 --> 15:24.660
per the last story.

15:24.660 --> 15:28.020
We were talking about the wood you believe Jamie said something about it needs to be in the wood grain

15:28.020 --> 15:31.020
That is so cool. If it is coming out in the wood grain coming up

15:31.020 --> 15:36.540
Hey, man, that totally would make me happy maybe people from Atari were listening to this, huh? Yeah summer

15:36.540 --> 15:39.140
Yeah summer for about 30 bucks. Hey 30 bucks for

15:41.100 --> 15:45.420
Addressing it is a classic gaming expo because you do know that's coming up in a couple months. Isn't that weird?

15:45.420 --> 15:52.140
I just slammed Namco on the been there done that attitude and now here I am getting all giddy about the wood grain

15:52.140 --> 15:57.140
It's all about, you know, how you execute it. That's really what it is.

15:57.140 --> 15:58.140
I guess you're right. I guess you're right.

15:58.140 --> 16:03.140
Because they've released these Namco collections before and now they're just releasing it on a new system.

16:03.140 --> 16:08.140
And for example, I have one of the Namco collections for the GBA already.

16:08.140 --> 16:14.140
They already have these games out in the GBA. It's just re-releasing the same damn thing again.

16:14.140 --> 16:21.140
Well, also one thing though about those Namco collections on PS1, you do need to keep in mind that at least two of those are considered ultra rare now.

16:21.140 --> 16:26.820
air now you cannot find the M nor can you find the O actually I think that

16:26.820 --> 16:31.000
back it was the A and the C I take that back which I actually I think I have all

16:31.000 --> 16:37.380
of them now and then they've released the restricted symbol in Japan so

16:37.380 --> 16:42.060
actually those are collectors items people are not going to be able to find

16:42.060 --> 16:45.980
those games on ps1 but not a lot of those games are a part of this

16:45.980 --> 16:50.060
compilation so you know even so they're getting you know I've never saw Mappy

16:50.060 --> 16:53.740
released on one I thought maybe it was in the first one oh I guess not that I

16:53.740 --> 16:59.380
recall my bad um actually it probably was but even so you know these are full

16:59.380 --> 17:04.580
arcade versions it's a lot of them in one package you know I'm gonna have it

17:04.580 --> 17:08.780
you know playing Xevious at home and then go ahead and play a mappy and then

17:08.780 --> 17:12.620
pack land if I want to of course I could play pack land on my turbo graphics but

17:12.620 --> 17:19.980
still it's pretty cool fair enough um another Namco story another

17:19.980 --> 17:24.980
series now going from very old to Namco to very new Namco Katamari Dimashii to

17:24.980 --> 17:30.860
details released Nina Daisuke Katamari Dimashii translates to we love

17:30.860 --> 17:34.980
Katamari and it is actually they changed the title for the oh I'm sorry they did

17:34.980 --> 17:38.580
it's everybody loves Katamari Dimashii in Japan here it's we love Katamari

17:38.580 --> 17:42.580
Dimashii I just got served all right it is gonna be called we love Katamari in

17:42.580 --> 17:46.480
North America and so this game is coming out here for sure there was still a

17:46.480 --> 17:50.640
little bit of a question mark but it is coming out here for sure some great

17:50.640 --> 17:55.280
screenshots circulating out there on the internet and it will be out in 2005

17:55.280 --> 18:02.160
they're saying new locations new objects Eiffel Tower has been spotted cats trees

18:02.160 --> 18:09.960
junk yes and apparently the co-op mode now is in better levels than just like

18:09.960 --> 18:14.880
it was like an arena in the first one that was more of a versus yeah but the

18:14.880 --> 18:20.380
first one to even have that kind of versus mode in it was cool but now

18:20.380 --> 18:24.060
Katamari 2 is gonna expand on that and I think that's cool and this one we

18:24.060 --> 18:28.500
actually to solve the level you have to work together very cool and you get to

18:28.500 --> 18:32.700
play as some of the cousins too which is great so because the cousins I mean

18:32.700 --> 18:36.140
there was all these great concepts in Katamari to mashi one but they didn't

18:36.140 --> 18:40.400
get to develop much of them, I think. So Katamari, I think, is going to be one of those games

18:40.400 --> 18:45.060
that it's going to be one of the big franchise games of the next decade.

18:45.060 --> 18:49.700
I'd love to see how, if it expands bigger than that immediate area, if we actually end

18:49.700 --> 18:52.700
up with a world expansion as the camera moves out.

18:52.700 --> 18:58.220
We'll see, we'll see. Alright, we're getting a lot of E3 news, because E3 is just around

18:58.220 --> 19:02.420
the corner, so lots and lots of E3 news. There's a concert that's going to be happening before

19:02.420 --> 19:06.460
E3 the Final Fantasy concert is more friends music from Final Fantasy and

19:06.460 --> 19:11.060
announced and I am very very excited about this not only are the black mage

19:11.060 --> 19:16.580
is going to be playing but amico Shiratori and Riki are going to be there

19:16.580 --> 19:21.420
singing their theme songs from Final Fantasy 9 and Final Fantasy 10 are going

19:21.420 --> 19:26.340
to be there singing the songs live and get this the opera from Final Fantasy 6

19:26.340 --> 19:33.140
is being performed with opera singers oh it's gonna be great I'm so excited about

19:33.140 --> 19:37.660
this one chills get this tickets still available because this is at the

19:37.660 --> 19:40.380
amphitheater Universal amphitheater I guess they changed name the Gibson

19:40.380 --> 19:43.340
amphitheater formerly the Universal amphitheater tickets are still available

19:43.340 --> 19:47.660
because it's so big so right yeah it's Monday it's the Monday before May 16th

19:47.660 --> 19:53.520
very very soon gotta work Oh bummer I'm really hoping that they tape it I mean

19:53.520 --> 19:56.600
they've got this is gonna be here they haven't even done this in Japan yet

19:56.600 --> 20:02.280
doesn't be huge I hope they tape it and do a DVD or something more e3 news

20:02.280 --> 20:05.480
squeamix and we'll move on with them they announced what games are gonna be

20:05.480 --> 20:11.460
showing at e3 Final Fantasy 7 dirge of cerebras is gonna be one of their big

20:11.460 --> 20:15.280
titles that they're gonna be showing Final Fantasy 12 yet again because it

20:15.280 --> 20:19.360
didn't come out like it was supposed to Dragon Quest 8 journey of the cursed

20:19.360 --> 20:24.360
King, Full Metal Alchemist 2, Curse of the Crimson Elixir, hopefully that one's gonna

20:24.360 --> 20:26.040
be better than the first one.

20:26.040 --> 20:29.360
Apparently curses are the big thing in the role playing games this year, we'll see.

20:29.360 --> 20:34.000
Kingdom Hearts 2, I'm hoping for a playable, that'd be great, I wanna see a playable Kingdom

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
Hearts 2.

20:35.000 --> 20:40.600
A Romancing Saga, can't say I'm a fan of the Saga series, yeah, sorry.

20:40.600 --> 20:41.880
I tried, I tried too.

20:41.880 --> 20:46.880
But Front Mission Online, they're gonna expand the online series.

20:46.880 --> 20:50.680
missions like started with the Super Nintendo back when. Interesting enough

20:50.680 --> 20:54.200
Squeenix is saying that they are we and we call them Squeenix we know it's you

20:54.200 --> 20:59.560
know Square Enix or Squeenix but we call them Squeenix. On the PC they have

20:59.560 --> 21:03.000
Final Fantasy 11 as a game they're going to be showing off very strange

21:03.000 --> 21:06.200
considering this game is a couple years old now so they're are they gonna be

21:06.200 --> 21:10.120
showing off the new patches or could there be a new expansion in the works I

21:10.120 --> 21:14.680
hope so. I think probably patches and from what I've heard I know last year

21:14.680 --> 21:19.920
They have like a ballista tournament type thing going on. I think this is gonna be the same tournament as

21:20.920 --> 21:26.400
They're having some Hawaii location where it's kind of like boss battle type thing. Hmm

21:26.400 --> 21:30.820
I think that's what they're doing with this one. We'll see I dose announced their lineup as well

21:31.160 --> 21:37.680
what's going to be interesting is that they're going to be showing the games hitman blood money 25 to life commando strike force and

21:37.680 --> 21:40.440
And, Lara Croft Tomb Raider Legend.

21:40.440 --> 21:42.280
The life was last year too.

21:42.280 --> 21:44.840
Well, that's another line up for this year.

21:44.840 --> 21:47.760
So, Lara Croft Tomb Raider Legend.

21:47.760 --> 21:50.600
I thought that they had officially said no more Tomb Raider games, but I guess...

21:50.600 --> 21:51.600
I saw pictures.

21:51.600 --> 21:52.600
We would only be so lucky.

21:52.600 --> 21:53.600
There are pictures online.

21:53.600 --> 21:55.000
I just, I think Tomb Raider's done.

21:55.000 --> 21:58.760
There are pictures online and Lara Croft has bigger boobs as usual.

21:58.760 --> 22:00.400
I don't doubt that it's really happening.

22:00.400 --> 22:03.960
I mean, Tomb Raider was such a huge franchise, but I think it's kind of done.

22:03.960 --> 22:05.400
I have no interest in Tomb Raider.

22:05.400 --> 22:12.400
you guess where those pictures are at? Where? MTV. Oh my gosh. Their brand new gamer site.

22:12.400 --> 22:18.580
Yes, MTV Games launched this week. They have a brand new gaming site. They get pretty much

22:18.580 --> 22:23.620
all their news from GameSpot. There's not a whole lot, but I guess we'll see what happens

22:23.620 --> 22:30.620
with it. Yet another thing MTV can stop showing music videos for, huh? This is music television.

22:30.620 --> 22:37.540
They should really change it to like pop culture television or something like that. I mean, how about to subliminal television?

22:37.540 --> 22:39.540
I don't know cookie cutter TV. I

22:40.400 --> 22:46.400
Think that there's better sites, but who knows they might do something to impress me later on. So we'll see, right? I

22:47.240 --> 22:49.240
have faith

22:49.720 --> 22:53.920
E3 also one last story. Yahoo is going to be doing a mobile

22:53.920 --> 22:58.800
mobile show and they're going to be showing Yahoo poker. They're trying to do this whole

22:58.800 --> 23:05.400
cross platform PC mobile thing. So that should be interesting, Yahoo poker, because Texas

23:05.400 --> 23:08.720
Hold'em is the big thing right now. So we'll see.

23:08.720 --> 23:13.540
All right, Orange Lounge Radio, we're not just here to talk about gaming, but we're

23:13.540 --> 23:18.400
also here to better your life because you know, if we talked about games all the time,

23:18.400 --> 23:23.660
we would have no time to go out and illegally gamble. So we're here to better your life

23:23.660 --> 23:27.540
with some advice who better than Dark Sakura with her advice column and Dark

23:27.540 --> 23:33.860
Sakura what do you have to share with us tonight today's bit of advice is how to

23:33.860 --> 23:39.940
wrestle free from an alligator number one if you were on land try to get on

23:39.940 --> 23:44.360
the alligators back and put downward pressure on its neck this will force the

23:44.360 --> 23:49.540
head and jaws down number two close the alligators eyes this will usually make

23:49.540 --> 23:53.360
it more sedate three if you were attacked go for the eyes and nose use

23:53.360 --> 23:59.680
Use any weapon you have or your fist.

23:59.680 --> 24:04.400
If its jaws are closed on something you want to remove, for example, a limb, tap or punch

24:04.400 --> 24:05.560
it on the snout.

24:05.560 --> 24:08.240
Alligators often open their mouths when tapped lightly.

24:08.240 --> 24:13.120
They may drop whatever it is they have taken hold of and back off.

24:13.120 --> 24:16.840
If the alligator gets you in its jaws, you must prevent it from shaking you or rolling

24:16.840 --> 24:17.840
over.

24:17.840 --> 24:20.780
These instinctual actions cause severe tissue damage.

24:20.780 --> 24:25.180
Try to keep the mouth clamped shut so the alligator does not begin shaking.

24:25.180 --> 24:26.180
6.

24:26.180 --> 24:31.000
Seek medical attention immediately, even for a small cut or bruise to treat infection.

24:31.000 --> 24:34.480
Alligators have a huge number of pathogens in their mouth.

24:34.480 --> 24:36.480
But you know what I always say?

24:36.480 --> 24:37.480
What?

24:37.480 --> 24:41.680
Don't go freakin' swimming in the swamp in Florida!

24:41.680 --> 24:43.660
Thank you for that.

24:43.660 --> 24:46.900
Always lovely advice.

24:46.900 --> 24:49.400
How many of you guys know, quick survey.

24:49.400 --> 24:55.960
many of you guys actually played Neopets previously? Jamie's got her hand raised. Weren't you into

24:55.960 --> 25:02.320
Neopets for a little bit, or at least your girlfriend was, wasn't she? My fiance is.

25:02.320 --> 25:06.200
I played Neopets for a little while. I'm trying to think way back. I think the closest thing

25:06.200 --> 25:11.920
I had that was close to Neopets would have been my pocket station. You know that Neopets

25:11.920 --> 25:16.360
has been like this slowly like huge growing thing online and now they sell this stuff

25:16.360 --> 25:20.680
at Claire's and all that stuff well you know a long time ago Sony said that they

25:20.680 --> 25:24.080
were gonna make a Neopets game but then it just disappeared well guess what

25:24.080 --> 25:29.740
it's coming out now or at least some new version of the Neopets game August of

25:29.740 --> 25:40.000
2005 Neopets the darkest fairy the 3d action adventure will follow the

25:40.000 --> 25:46.240
characters as they journey through the realm of Neopia so should be Neopets are

25:46.240 --> 25:52.360
dead. So you're saying it's going to be a third person action adventure. You know what's

25:52.360 --> 26:01.600
sad is almost practically every game coming out for the PS2 is action adventure. You know

26:01.600 --> 26:06.620
what's funny is I had a customer, because I actually sell video games now, I had a customer

26:06.620 --> 26:14.400
looking for puzzle games coming out for the PS2 or Xbox. Nada. I think there was one that's

26:14.400 --> 26:15.960
coming out in like 2007.

26:15.960 --> 26:16.960
Wow.

26:16.960 --> 26:17.960
2007?

26:17.960 --> 26:18.960
Yeah.

26:18.960 --> 26:20.440
The console is still going to be going by then?

26:20.440 --> 26:23.360
So here's what you need to do, developers.

26:23.360 --> 26:26.560
Make more puzzle games for the PS2 and Xbox.

26:26.560 --> 26:30.240
Well here's an interesting story that ties into that and the games that we used to play.

26:30.240 --> 26:33.960
At least I know I used to play this, but this game got bigger and bigger.

26:33.960 --> 26:37.140
Puzzle Pirates is now going to be, this used to be something you could only really get

26:37.140 --> 26:38.360
on the internet.

26:38.360 --> 26:39.400
It's going to be in stores.

26:39.400 --> 26:41.140
It's coming out in stores this week.

26:41.140 --> 26:42.480
It's going to be on the shelves.

26:42.480 --> 26:46.840
So that's kind of interesting that Puzzle Pirates kind of got bigger like that.

26:46.840 --> 26:52.800
And it's going to be selling for $20, monthly subscription fee $9.95.

26:52.800 --> 26:58.200
Puzzle games you can see in Puzzle Pirates, sword fighting, drinking, sailing, bilge pumping,

26:58.200 --> 27:02.880
carpentry, gunnery, distilling, and randomly they have spades in there.

27:02.880 --> 27:07.080
And what's interesting about Puzzle Pirates is that it's like the Puzzle Fighter II inspired

27:07.080 --> 27:10.140
game, the Bejeweled inspired game.

27:10.140 --> 27:13.500
But I actually, I kind of had fun with Puzzle Pirates when I played it.

27:13.500 --> 27:17.420
I thought the interface needed work, but again, before I get the hate mail from the Puzzle

27:17.420 --> 27:21.020
Pirates community, it was like two years ago and they were still baiting it when I played,

27:21.020 --> 27:24.340
so I'm sure a lot's changed and it's probably polished now, so I probably should go back

27:24.340 --> 27:26.460
and check it out.

27:26.460 --> 27:31.020
But I'm glad the game's been successful, I think it was a neat idea, but people are going

27:31.020 --> 27:34.020
way too far with the pirate thing, like they have conventions where they all go and they

27:34.020 --> 27:35.020
dress up as pirates.

27:35.020 --> 27:36.020
Arr!

27:36.020 --> 27:37.020
Yeah.

27:37.020 --> 27:38.260
That was scary, like some of the furry stuff.

27:38.260 --> 27:44.580
I don't know, worship Johnny Depp and stuff, I don't know.

27:44.580 --> 27:46.900
Movie studios and their UMDs.

27:46.900 --> 27:48.740
Hey, the UMDs are getting bigger and bigger.

27:48.740 --> 27:51.180
Fox is very, very close to committing,

27:51.180 --> 27:54.340
and the rumor is saying that their lineup would initially

27:54.340 --> 27:58.620
include Dodgeball, iRobot, Super Troopers, Predator,

27:58.620 --> 28:00.460
and Napoleon Dynamite.

28:00.460 --> 28:01.500
Hey, that's cool.

28:01.500 --> 28:03.220
Universal, thinking about it.

28:03.220 --> 28:06.460
Paramount is investigating it right now.

28:06.460 --> 28:09.980
So UMDs look like it could be taken off?

28:09.980 --> 28:10.780
Don't know.

28:10.780 --> 28:12.460
Loki, I'd say you're the expert on this.

28:12.460 --> 28:13.140
This is your industry.

28:13.140 --> 28:13.800
What do you think?

28:13.800 --> 28:14.300
Yep.

28:14.300 --> 28:16.380
They're trying to go this route.

28:16.380 --> 28:18.420
They're trying to push this stuff way too much.

28:18.420 --> 28:20.300
I have not seen sales figures on UMD.

28:20.300 --> 28:21.940
Is it really doing that well?

28:21.940 --> 28:22.620
I don't know.

28:22.620 --> 28:23.300
I'll be honest.

28:23.300 --> 28:26.140
I mean, I haven't really had anyone requesting UMD movies.

28:26.140 --> 28:28.100
They were just trying to push it on these people.

28:28.100 --> 28:34.340
But honestly, see, because as far as PSPs go, rental-wise,

28:34.340 --> 28:37.660
there's not that many stores renting games for that stuff right now

28:37.660 --> 28:39.160
because they're

28:39.160 --> 28:43.100
the market right now the people there they're not really going to spend the

28:43.100 --> 28:47.660
money on these things uh... so it's not what i think probably after the summer

28:47.660 --> 28:49.580
you're going to see UMD movies everywhere

28:49.580 --> 28:50.700
but the thing is

28:50.700 --> 28:52.700
and i still don't understand this

28:52.700 --> 28:56.540
why are you buying a movie for your psp

28:56.540 --> 29:00.220
that you have on your have a dvd i don't get it either i don't get it

29:00.220 --> 29:03.620
maybe they're looking for the portable convenience but you know what i've got

29:03.620 --> 29:07.940
portable convenience I have a laptop but even I could the only way I can think

29:07.940 --> 29:10.780
that this would be probably better it's like you know those people that buy

29:10.780 --> 29:17.220
portable DVD players then you can buy a PSP for your kids because they're you

29:17.220 --> 29:20.340
know and then you know they have the movies too that they can watch but

29:20.340 --> 29:24.340
nowadays too you also have all these SUVs and stuff with TVs in their car

29:24.340 --> 29:28.420
really what it comes down to is kids need to learn to sit still and shut up

29:28.420 --> 29:32.340
and sleep during car rides I have not heard anything about sales figures on

29:32.340 --> 29:33.560
on the

29:33.560 --> 29:37.100
i don't know how well they're doing but really what i think

29:37.100 --> 29:39.940
i don't know if it's gonna take off though i i

29:39.940 --> 29:41.040
really

29:41.040 --> 29:44.340
i'm really worrying about this i mean cuz it's like people

29:44.340 --> 29:48.040
were telling me months back he added deviate just is going to be the

29:48.040 --> 29:51.460
revolution is going to hit the video is removed

29:51.460 --> 29:55.980
and i said from day one of my this thing is going to fail faster than laserdisc

29:55.980 --> 29:58.020
and what watch

29:58.020 --> 29:59.180
and on

29:59.180 --> 30:00.220
guess what

30:00.220 --> 30:04.700
Uh, DVHS? What's that? Oh, that's right. It's not being made anymore.

30:04.700 --> 30:07.660
I would really like to hear from our listeners. If you are somebody who is

30:07.660 --> 30:11.060
supporting the UMD and you're buying movies on UMD, we want to know why!

30:11.060 --> 30:14.580
Send us an email to go at orangelaundry.com. And I'm not, you know, we're not trying to say,

30:14.580 --> 30:17.340
like, oh, you're a bad person for doing it. We just want to know, you know, what's, what's the

30:17.340 --> 30:20.500
draw? What's the appeal to you? Because we don't see it. I mean, I got Spider-Man 2 with

30:20.500 --> 30:24.300
my PSP, because I got the neat little bundle thing.

30:24.300 --> 30:29.340
I would never see myself actually buying this, or paying for this, um, and

30:29.340 --> 30:33.140
it really it I don't know it's just not anything I would spend money on

30:33.140 --> 30:36.540
right I

30:36.540 --> 30:40.540
dark soccer did you have anything you want to add? well I'm actually looking for

30:40.540 --> 30:44.060
the sales figures I thought that there would be a financial report out already

30:44.060 --> 30:45.340
but I haven't

30:45.340 --> 30:48.500
found one yet here okay I'm sure we'll see something on the next one. Studios

30:48.500 --> 30:51.820
here's what you need to be doing and trust me this is the greatest idea right

30:51.820 --> 30:52.260
here

30:52.260 --> 30:57.340
because everybody at least this is what I've been using my you know large

30:57.340 --> 31:00.600
of memory stick for TV

31:00.600 --> 31:05.720
episodes like for example perfect format for the UMD's

31:05.720 --> 31:10.080
like Aqua Teen Hunger Force. But wait a minute couldn't you do the same thing with

31:10.080 --> 31:14.320
DVDs and TV box sets? Exactly but here's the thing though

31:14.320 --> 31:18.440
is not many people have the time to sit down and watch

31:18.440 --> 31:22.040
a three-hour movie or two-hour movie you know on the go

31:22.040 --> 31:25.960
you have like 15 minutes between your class you know 15 minutes here

31:25.960 --> 31:31.840
30 minutes here maybe 15 minutes I watch my robot chickens and I watch my family

31:31.840 --> 31:35.940
guy and there you go that's just enough time to sit down and watch this really

31:35.940 --> 31:39.200
quick all right I see where you're going with that okay okay interesting idea

31:39.200 --> 31:44.160
that's what I think they need to be doing TV shows instead of movies in UMD

31:44.160 --> 31:46.800
format because the Internet's doing it already like you just said you've

31:46.800 --> 31:52.560
already done it exactly went the controversial way about doing yeah I mean

31:52.560 --> 31:57.240
But honestly, I think that's what they're going to try to do is an online service too

31:57.240 --> 32:00.440
where you download media to your memory stick.

32:00.440 --> 32:03.080
Are you saying you would actually pay for a service like this?

32:03.080 --> 32:05.340
No, I would not pay for a service like this.

32:05.340 --> 32:06.340
But most people would.

32:06.340 --> 32:07.340
Hell no.

32:07.340 --> 32:11.560
If you can do it for free, why the hell would I even pay for a service like this?

32:11.560 --> 32:16.360
Lastly, speaking of movies and such, the Silent Hill movie has begun filming.

32:16.360 --> 32:19.560
I'm a big fan of Silent Hill.

32:19.560 --> 32:21.240
Dark Soccer, I know you're a big fan of Silent Hill.

32:21.240 --> 32:23.240
What do you think about this movie news?

32:23.240 --> 32:24.240
Tell us about what's going on.

32:24.240 --> 32:31.240
Well, just checking, I'm actually using UpcomingHorrorMovies.com, they actually have a pretty good timeline

32:31.240 --> 32:37.200
listed on the site, they have already started, they're in pre-production right now, started

32:37.200 --> 32:38.200
some filming.

32:38.200 --> 32:43.600
A lot of the scenes from the actual game are showing up in the movie, so they're definitely

32:43.600 --> 32:47.540
having that tie-in factor there, it's actually already looking better to be, you know, better

32:47.540 --> 32:51.100
associated with the universe than say the Resident Evil movies were but it's

32:51.100 --> 32:56.580
looking very good so far they've definitely got the feel down so far on

32:56.580 --> 33:01.420
the cast they have I guess it's pronounced Radha Mitchell from Finding

33:01.420 --> 33:06.260
Neverland as Rose who is the main character as her daughter they have

33:06.260 --> 33:10.100
Jodelle Ferlin and as her husband they have Sean Bean who was Boromir in

33:10.100 --> 33:14.460
Fellowship of the Rings and you we bowl is not directing this right oh no oh no

33:14.460 --> 33:20.060
few I know I had I want to say it was the guy that did Brotherhood of the

33:20.060 --> 33:28.940
Wolf yes Kristoff something I don't know so I I have I really have high hopes for

33:28.940 --> 33:32.820
this and I hope I I kind of hope that a kiriyama mocha gets to be written by

33:32.820 --> 33:37.280
Roger Avery does it say anything about who's doing the music I really hope they

33:37.280 --> 33:43.140
get it off guns is the director is the direct ah okay um a production company

33:43.140 --> 33:50.700
Davis films Roger Avery is the scripting makeup by Paul Jones who did Resident

33:50.700 --> 33:54.780
Evil apocalypse that's just makeup I mean but he's doing the gore effects

33:54.780 --> 33:58.940
that's cool that's cool all right so and the guy who did underworld is doing the

33:58.940 --> 34:04.580
creatures well I guess although I don't know how much I'd want this movie to

34:04.580 --> 34:09.780
have in common with underworld is 45 to 50 million dollars that's a lot of faith

34:09.780 --> 34:14.940
in this movie. That's pretty cool. That's about $25,000 a day for production. I have

34:14.940 --> 34:19.700
high hopes for this movie. I really hope they get it right. I think this is, really we need

34:19.700 --> 34:25.420
a good video game movie. We really do. Please don't screw this up, you guys. Pretty please.

34:25.420 --> 34:29.740
I like what I'm hearing so far. I like that the folks have been on some of those big sites

34:29.740 --> 34:32.160
saying that they're gonna... Because I think people need to know that video game movie

34:32.160 --> 34:37.540
can be done well, then that way we both can get out of work. We'll see what happens. We'll

34:37.540 --> 34:38.380
We'll keep you guys posted.

34:38.380 --> 34:40.940
Anyway, we're running over, so let's wrap it up.

34:40.940 --> 34:42.900
Let's go around and give everybody's final words

34:42.900 --> 34:43.740
for tonight.

34:43.740 --> 34:44.660
Oh, one last thing I did want to add.

34:44.660 --> 34:46.820
If you notice our sound is a little bit different tonight,

34:46.820 --> 34:49.060
that's because we're actually in a new studio,

34:49.060 --> 34:51.480
so we had to kind of redo everything.

34:51.480 --> 34:53.640
We went through a move here locally,

34:53.640 --> 34:55.060
so we redid all our chords.

34:55.060 --> 34:57.060
So our sound is a little different.

34:57.060 --> 34:58.180
Tell us what you guys think,

34:58.180 --> 35:00.180
if you think we should tweak it or whatever,

35:00.180 --> 35:03.180
togo at orangelaungeradio.com, T-O-G-O.

35:03.180 --> 35:05.280
So you thought, though, that you got rid of something

35:05.280 --> 35:06.380
from the old studio.

35:06.380 --> 35:08.380
Oh no, you found it, didn't you?

35:09.380 --> 35:10.380
Stuffed ferret.

35:10.380 --> 35:11.380
Hooray.

35:11.380 --> 35:13.380
They found a way back.

35:13.380 --> 35:16.380
I thought I buried that in the deepest, darkest box.

35:16.380 --> 35:17.380
All right, anyway.

35:17.380 --> 35:18.380
Final thoughts.

35:18.380 --> 35:19.380
Logie.

35:19.380 --> 35:23.380
I forgot to mention this on the three hour show that we do, but here's something I'd

35:23.380 --> 35:24.380
like to mention.

35:24.380 --> 35:25.380
Fine.

35:25.380 --> 35:29.380
People, I went to see the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, the movie that came out recently,

35:29.380 --> 35:31.380
and there's people wearing towels.

35:31.380 --> 35:35.380
Now granted, I know that this is part of the book and people, you know, they're fans of

35:35.380 --> 35:41.820
book and they want to dress up for stuff. I have a big problem with this. It's a movie.

35:41.820 --> 35:46.060
It's not a convention. It does not require cosplay. I hate the people that dress up like

35:46.060 --> 35:49.340
Star Wars characters. Now wait a minute, as someone who did Rocky Horror Picture Show

35:49.340 --> 35:54.980
a couple times. Okay, there's a difference between participating in the movie and going

35:54.980 --> 35:58.740
to watch a movie in costume. Okay, that's a little different. Okay. Okay. Star Wars

35:58.740 --> 36:04.000
is not a participation movie. It's not a participation movie. It's like, and all these people dress

36:04.000 --> 36:09.320
up and they're like in character and stuff like that and I have problems with that the

36:09.320 --> 36:13.340
Matrix people and the Lord of the Rings people because you all do this and we have the Star

36:13.340 --> 36:18.640
Wars people with their lightsabers exactly I hate these people and they're so annoying

36:18.640 --> 36:25.040
they are goddamn annoying and they just I get the bug me the hardcore people ruined

36:25.040 --> 36:29.080
the Phantom Menace for me because they cheered at every reference I was missing dialogue

36:29.080 --> 36:32.900
because they just would not be quiet I do have to say something in their favor okay

36:32.900 --> 36:35.900
When we were in line for the Phantom Menace is actually better than the movie

36:36.180 --> 36:41.180
This was at the theater in Roseville with the trees everywhere and people pulled out of line

36:41.180 --> 36:46.100
Brought out their lightsabers and had an impromptu duel under the trees with the lights behind him

36:46.100 --> 36:50.300
So all you saw was their silhouettes and the glowing lightsaber and that was better than the movie

36:50.820 --> 36:55.100
You have to admit though. That's pretty good. You know what I was geeky, but it was off

36:55.100 --> 36:57.100
Do you think either one of them got laid that night?

36:57.100 --> 36:59.100
Who cares? They were cool for five minutes.

36:59.100 --> 37:05.100
You know what I love? I love the people that wait in line for like, you know, 30 days or whatever.

37:05.100 --> 37:07.100
I don't even know how many days these people are.

37:07.100 --> 37:11.100
And then what I would do is I would walk up past them and go,

37:11.100 --> 37:13.100
Ha! I fandangled my tickets.

37:13.100 --> 37:17.100
But they do it for charity, so you have to cut them a little slack.

37:17.100 --> 37:21.100
No, no, no, no. Some people may do it for charity. Not everyone does it for charity.

37:21.100 --> 37:24.100
Anyway, that was a heck of a final thought.

37:24.100 --> 37:25.100
Alright, I'm done.

37:25.100 --> 37:32.180
