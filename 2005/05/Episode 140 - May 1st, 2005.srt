[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, something like that.

35
00:09:31,032 --> 00:09:33,994
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, try this microphone, because for some reason this one's really quiet.

36
00:09:34,194 --> 00:09:34,775
[SPEAKER_29]: Can you hear me now?

37
00:09:35,095 --> 00:09:35,755
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, good.

38
00:09:36,116 --> 00:09:39,698

[SPEAKER_02]: What the hell?

43
00:09:44,682 --> 00:09:47,825
[SPEAKER_02]: I licked it, actually, because I do that to things that I believe are mine.

44
00:09:47,865 --> 00:09:49,186
[SPEAKER_02]: I lick them so nobody touches them.

45

00:09:50,127 --> 00:09:50,327

51
00:09:57,372 --> 00:09:58,393

00:10:18,482 --> 00:10:19,862
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, like, hi, I'm done, okay.

65
00:10:22,003 --> 00:10:24,144
[SPEAKER_29]: Queenie, as always, what can you say?

66
00:10:24,324 --> 00:10:27,625
[SPEAKER_29]: Usually when I stick something phallic in his face, he doesn't shy away from it.

67
00:10:27,885 --> 00:10:29,045
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, alright.

68
00:10:30,406 --> 00:10:33,587
[SPEAKER_02]: We're gonna go to a quick break after this break of some opening music.

69
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,608
[SPEAKER_02]: We got a lot to talk about tonight.

70
00:10:36,268 --> 00:10:45,691
[SPEAKER_02]: First off, I want to apologize if there wasn't a new intro tonight, but I've just been very, very busy with, like, moving and the Lion King, because I went and saw Lion King today.

71
00:10:45,711 --> 00:10:46,111
[SPEAKER_29]: Okay.

72
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:49,343
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw the Lion King, I can die now.

73
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:51,905
[SPEAKER_29]: Uh, question, Lion King came out years ago.

74
00:10:52,005 --> 00:10:54,608
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no, the play, stupid, the play.

75
00:10:55,809 --> 00:10:57,731
[SPEAKER_29]: Oh, because of course, I knew there was a play.

76
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:00,233
[SPEAKER_30]: Oh my god, crawl out of that hole you've been in.

77
00:11:01,114 --> 00:11:02,356
[SPEAKER_30]: Fine, fine.

78
00:11:02,616 --> 00:11:03,316
[SPEAKER_30]: Doesn't work with me.

79
00:11:03,977 --> 00:11:07,841
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll be back after this break.

80
00:11:08,061 --> 00:11:08,902
[SPEAKER_30]: Oh god, here he is.

81
00:11:10,373 --> 00:11:11,514
[SPEAKER_30]: We were wondering where you were.

82
00:11:11,714 --> 00:11:16,936
[SPEAKER_30]: Well, maybe you're fucking up... Oh, I'm sorry.

83
00:11:17,757 --> 00:11:18,397
[SPEAKER_30]: I'm sorry.

84
00:11:19,338 --> 00:11:20,538
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not in a fucking good mood.

85
00:11:20,698 --> 00:11:21,339
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.

86
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:22,759
[SPEAKER_25]: What's going on?

87
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,960
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm fucking tired!

88
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:28,742
[SPEAKER_08]: I was just asleep because I've been driving all goddamn weekend!

89
00:11:29,302 --> 00:11:30,483
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm so damn tired!

90
00:11:30,703 --> 00:11:32,724
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I get here... Oh, there's a parking!

91
00:11:32,764 --> 00:11:35,005
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just gonna park four fucking blocks away!

92
00:11:35,626 --> 00:11:36,366
[SPEAKER_09]: That'll be fun!

93
00:11:36,386 --> 00:11:38,287

Thanks for watching!

105
00:17:47,575 --> 00:17:53,782
[SPEAKER_30]: Gaming Radio, so uncensored that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.

106
00:17:56,244 --> 00:17:57,605
[SPEAKER_30]: Orange Lounge Radio.

107
00:17:59,507 --> 00:18:02,971
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey guys, we're back here with more Orange Lounge Radio.

108
00:18:04,642 --> 00:18:06,483
[SPEAKER_02]: Starting off in our brand new studio.

109
00:18:07,164 --> 00:18:11,347
[SPEAKER_02]: We picked up and moved the things from Folsom, and now we are in a town called Rancho Cordova.

110
00:18:11,387 --> 00:18:16,850
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all still Sacramento, so for those of you guys who are curious where we're at, we just moved down the freeway a little bit, that's all.

111
00:18:18,611 --> 00:18:24,635
[SPEAKER_02]: And I apologize because our audio levels are a little bit screwy tonight, and I really don't know the best way to fix them.

112
00:18:25,576 --> 00:18:30,980
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're just going to kind of adjust them as we go along tonight, because I know it sounds a little weird.

113
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,821
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I sound very amplified, I don't know.

114
00:18:33,516 --> 00:18:38,358
[SPEAKER_02]: You're always amped up I know Jamie sounds great I always sound great

115
00:18:39,373 --> 00:18:40,413
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, maybe it was just the mics.

116
00:18:40,734 --> 00:18:46,936
[SPEAKER_02]: We kind of played mic roulette, too, a little bit to try and bring some quiet people up and some loud people down, but now I'm, like, too loud.

117
00:18:47,316 --> 00:18:47,656
[SPEAKER_02]: It's weird.

118
00:18:48,336 --> 00:18:48,637
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

119
00:18:48,917 --> 00:18:49,037
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

120
00:18:49,057 --> 00:18:51,197
[SPEAKER_02]: Turn yourself down.

121
00:18:51,257 --> 00:18:51,878
[SPEAKER_02]: Which one am I?

122
00:18:52,018 --> 00:18:52,858
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know which one I am.

123
00:18:53,238 --> 00:18:54,219
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, hello, hello, hello.

124
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:54,979
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I'm too quiet.

125
00:18:55,239 --> 00:18:55,679
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello!

126
00:18:55,699 --> 00:18:56,159
[SPEAKER_02]: Oops.

127
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:59,160
[SPEAKER_20]: This is awesome radio.

128
00:18:59,360 --> 00:18:59,741
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

129
00:19:00,141 --> 00:19:01,221
[SPEAKER_02]: Check, check, check.

130
00:19:01,281 --> 00:19:01,761
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, fine.

131
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,162
[SPEAKER_02]: You're listening to mic check radio.

132
00:19:05,323 --> 00:19:05,503
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

133
00:19:06,563 --> 00:19:10,550
[SPEAKER_02]: Imagine that, that we got nominated for that live 365 award thing.

134
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:11,091
[SPEAKER_02]: Two of them.

135
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:13,234
[SPEAKER_02]: And the award show... Can I nominate you?

136
00:19:13,294 --> 00:19:14,797
[SPEAKER_02]: The award show was last night.

137
00:19:14,817 --> 00:19:15,618
[SPEAKER_27]: The name is what?

138
00:19:15,638 --> 00:19:15,818
[SPEAKER_27]: Ultraman?

139
00:19:15,838 --> 00:19:15,878
[SPEAKER_27]: No.

140
00:19:16,059 --> 00:19:18,543
[SPEAKER_27]: To retrieve my thermal container from the...

141
00:19:19,477 --> 00:19:21,898
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop distracting me over there.

142
00:19:22,118 --> 00:19:24,258
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were nominated for two Best of Life Use 5 awards.

143
00:19:24,278 --> 00:19:26,199
[SPEAKER_02]: So we went to the little shindig they had last night.

144
00:19:26,839 --> 00:19:30,180
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we looked pretty hot, I've got to say.

145
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,060
[SPEAKER_02]: We were certainly unique.

146
00:19:32,361 --> 00:19:33,321
[SPEAKER_20]: I looked very drunk.

147
00:19:36,802 --> 00:19:38,322
[SPEAKER_02]: All these random people keep coming in here.

148
00:19:39,383 --> 00:19:43,264
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, we're trying to do radio.

149
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:51,231
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to close my eyes so I can't see people keep coming into the studio.

150
00:19:53,031 --> 00:19:54,811
[SPEAKER_02]: The Best of Life 365 Awards were last night.

151
00:19:54,831 --> 00:19:55,692
[SPEAKER_02]: We went to the Shindig.

152
00:19:56,012 --> 00:19:58,212
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't win, but that's okay.

153
00:19:58,452 --> 00:20:10,474
[SPEAKER_02]: We're cool with it because, you know, when we looked at the chat room, because they actually had the chat room being projected on the nearby wall so we could see the chat and see people talking about, you know, the awards and stuff.

154
00:20:10,754 --> 00:20:14,095
[SPEAKER_02]: When we looked in the chat room, there was like six or seven people yelling, Oh, hello!

155
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:17,587
[SPEAKER_02]: Just screaming little fanboys and fangirls.

156
00:20:18,007 --> 00:20:19,289
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was so cool to see.

157
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:24,899
[SPEAKER_02]: So I really appreciate you guys that joined us there in spirit last night and were yelling things.

158
00:20:25,996 --> 00:20:28,759
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably offending other broadcasters, but that's okay.

159
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:31,442
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them need their feathers ruffled a little bit, honestly.

160
00:20:32,503 --> 00:20:33,985
[SPEAKER_02]: But actually we met some very cool people.

161
00:20:34,145 --> 00:20:35,947
[SPEAKER_02]: We met some very awesome other broadcasters.

162
00:20:36,187 --> 00:20:36,667
[SPEAKER_19]: We sure did.

163
00:20:37,128 --> 00:20:38,609
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were very happy about that.

164
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:45,076
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we also met some, well we didn't really meet them, but we also saw some people that were kind of jerks.

165
00:20:45,216 --> 00:20:47,499
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had no idea how they were winning awards, but that's alright.

166
00:20:50,669 --> 00:20:51,830
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the nature of the business.

167
00:20:52,051 --> 00:20:52,752
[SPEAKER_02]: Them's the breaks.

168
00:20:53,773 --> 00:20:54,474
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had those.

169
00:20:54,634 --> 00:20:56,416
[SPEAKER_20]: And we will break them in the future.

170
00:20:57,037 --> 00:21:00,280
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had a good time, and thanks, you guys, for getting us nominated.

171
00:21:00,701 --> 00:21:03,524
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though we didn't win, it was still cool, and we'll just try again next year.

172
00:21:06,368 --> 00:21:07,569
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, we're famous.

173
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:12,533
[SPEAKER_02]: To anybody who saw us in the paper here recently and is tuning in because of it, welcome.

174
00:21:12,773 --> 00:21:15,275
[SPEAKER_02]: I swear our shows are usually not this disorganized.

175
00:21:15,695 --> 00:21:24,301
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's interesting because the article that ran in the Sacramento Bee, which is our local paper, pretty big paper around here, it talks about how we do the show every week in our Folsom apartment.

176
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:28,464
[SPEAKER_02]: But when they interviewed us, it was like five weeks ago or so.

177
00:21:28,484 --> 00:21:29,344
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a little while ago.

178
00:21:30,105 --> 00:21:31,146
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've moved since then.

179
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:32,647
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've had to been dealing with all that.

180
00:21:33,347 --> 00:21:34,608
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're not actually in Folsom anymore.

181
00:21:34,628 --> 00:21:35,549
[SPEAKER_02]: We're still in the Sacramento area.

182
00:21:36,634 --> 00:21:37,596
[SPEAKER_02]: But the story was very nice.

183
00:21:37,616 --> 00:21:38,497
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a very lovely article.

184
00:21:38,517 --> 00:21:39,538
[SPEAKER_02]: What did you guys think?

185
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:41,100
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was nice.

186
00:21:42,221 --> 00:21:43,102
[SPEAKER_02]: It was nice.

187
00:21:43,443 --> 00:21:44,384
[SPEAKER_20]: I was sort of in the shot.

188
00:21:47,978 --> 00:21:49,079
[SPEAKER_02]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

189
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:21,302
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it just added to the excitement of this entire week, NBA.

190
00:22:22,102 --> 00:22:27,145
[SPEAKER_19]: He was the first comment on my live stream, he's like, I love how the only picture of me is above my foot, and I started laughing.

191
00:22:28,046 --> 00:22:28,686
[SPEAKER_19]: That was funny.

192
00:22:30,647 --> 00:22:38,252
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it would have been cool if they had actually put a picture that had him in it, but... Oh, that would have been nice, but no, that's never going to happen.

193
00:22:40,464 --> 00:22:45,248
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well, what we're going to do now, we're going to start off the show as we usually do, although we got some tangents there, but that's all right.

194
00:22:45,268 --> 00:22:46,609
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to talk about those things real quick.

195
00:22:46,629 --> 00:22:52,013
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to be doing a little bit of how is your week, how is your day, where we go around and find out what's going on in people's lives.

196
00:22:52,573 --> 00:22:54,294
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and I know everybody's got a lot to say.

197
00:22:54,354 --> 00:22:56,035
[SPEAKER_02]: We weren't live last week.

198
00:22:56,096 --> 00:22:56,696
[SPEAKER_02]: We were taped.

199
00:22:56,736 --> 00:22:57,737
[SPEAKER_02]: We still had a new show.

200
00:22:58,517 --> 00:22:59,498
[SPEAKER_02]: My week was complete and utter shit.

201
00:22:59,518 --> 00:23:03,461
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I say complete and utter shit, the only way it could have been worse is if a house fell on my car, which I expected it to do on Friday.

202
00:23:03,541 --> 00:23:06,684
[SPEAKER_02]: Wednesday, I actually got up in a really good mood.

203
00:23:06,704 --> 00:23:07,064
[SPEAKER_02]: I was all happy.

204
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:29,238
[SPEAKER_20]: Go out and my trunk is open and my window is rolled down.

205
00:23:29,699 --> 00:23:36,881
[SPEAKER_20]: They stole the CD player out of my car, the fuckers, including a really good Gorillaz compilation CD that I put together to listen to in my car.

206
00:23:38,302 --> 00:23:42,643
[SPEAKER_20]: But they didn't take anything else, which I should be grateful for because my Bond CD was in my car too.

207
00:23:44,444 --> 00:23:48,666
[SPEAKER_20]: But it just, you know, it was sort of like the icing on the cake for me that day.

208
00:23:48,686 --> 00:23:52,907
[SPEAKER_20]: I was stressed out for school and I finally just ended up staying home that day because I was too stressed.

209
00:23:53,948 --> 00:23:54,388
[SPEAKER_20]: Next day.

210
00:23:55,305 --> 00:24:02,750
[SPEAKER_20]: I get in my car, I'm driving to work, and this guy driving a taxi van pulls out in front of me and I run into him.

211
00:24:04,023 --> 00:24:15,933
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, I have, um, pretty, uh, bad muscle contusion, which, um, in, like, normal people's terms is a big bad bruise around my hip, um, and a pinched nerve.

212
00:24:16,974 --> 00:24:23,179
[SPEAKER_20]: And now I'm on Vicodin, Flexerol, and 800 milligrams of Ibuprofen and lots of alcohol to make me feel better.

213
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:24,320
[SPEAKER_20]: Um...

214
00:24:26,942 --> 00:24:33,728
[SPEAKER_20]: I still need to find out, because it's totally not my fault, but I need to get the guy's insurance company to pay for the damages to my car.

215
00:24:33,848 --> 00:24:34,849
[SPEAKER_20]: I can't drive my car.

216
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:42,276
[SPEAKER_20]: We can probably hammer the fender back into some kind of shape that I can drive it in now, although my alignment's a little bit off.

217
00:24:42,816 --> 00:24:46,520
[SPEAKER_20]: But it's not undriveable except the fact that the fender keeps rubbing against my right tire.

218
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,441
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, nobody was hurt.

219
00:24:48,801 --> 00:24:58,224
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, well, I was hurt, but the other guy was nice, too, so I don't want to hear anyone saying, oh, well, that fucker this, or, you know, fuck him, because he was a nice guy.

220
00:24:58,384 --> 00:25:00,745
[SPEAKER_20]: He really was, and I feel bad for him, too.

221
00:25:01,205 --> 00:25:02,105
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, thank you.

222
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:04,126
[SPEAKER_20]: I got a yay for me being on Vicodin again.

223
00:25:05,086 --> 00:25:09,228
[SPEAKER_20]: I do actually do pretty damn good writing when I'm on Vicodin, so maybe I'll start writing again.

224
00:25:10,308 --> 00:25:10,388
[SPEAKER_20]: Um...

225
00:25:13,143 --> 00:25:19,007
[SPEAKER_20]: And then it was just a whole bunch of just different crap.

226
00:25:19,027 --> 00:25:30,916
[SPEAKER_20]: But it's been a really weird weekend because I got made moderator on the Gorillas Unofficial Board, which is one of the big ones there, run by a really cool crew there.

227
00:25:32,097 --> 00:25:37,781
[SPEAKER_20]: I also... We went to the Live 365 Awards where...

228
00:25:40,951 --> 00:25:42,452
[SPEAKER_20]: We were going to go over that later.

229
00:25:42,772 --> 00:25:46,355
[SPEAKER_20]: I won something on the little bingo thing that I did.

230
00:25:46,915 --> 00:25:49,277
[SPEAKER_20]: I'll go over that later, too.

231
00:25:50,038 --> 00:25:54,441
[SPEAKER_20]: And something else good happened, but for the life of me, I can't remember what it is.

232
00:25:55,561 --> 00:25:58,424
[SPEAKER_20]: It's like I can't remember my life anymore unless I read my damn live journal.

233
00:25:59,945 --> 00:26:08,511
[SPEAKER_20]: Other than that, though, I've been a weird combination of either going from incredibly elated to just super depressed over everything, so...

234
00:26:09,426 --> 00:26:11,507
[SPEAKER_20]: If I'm in a weird mood, blame the Vicodin.

235
00:26:13,028 --> 00:26:14,908
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

236
00:26:14,928 --> 00:26:16,609
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, and I didn't play anything.

237
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:20,331
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

238
00:26:20,471 --> 00:26:21,671
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go over to Loki.

239
00:26:21,731 --> 00:26:22,211
[SPEAKER_02]: How was your week?

240
00:26:22,251 --> 00:26:22,812
[SPEAKER_02]: How was your day?

241
00:26:23,052 --> 00:26:23,592
[SPEAKER_02]: Dare I ask?

242
00:26:25,063 --> 00:26:28,186
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this last three weeks have sucked.

243
00:26:29,568 --> 00:26:30,669
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been just busy.

244
00:26:30,809 --> 00:26:32,450
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't actually had time to rest.

245
00:26:32,951 --> 00:26:37,516
[SPEAKER_02]: My new job's just stressful as hell, and I'm just tired.

246
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:43,101
[SPEAKER_02]: Yesterday, I drove 200 miles to San Francisco.

247
00:26:43,542 --> 00:26:46,625
[SPEAKER_02]: Today, I drove 200 miles to Oakland.

248
00:26:47,626 --> 00:26:53,512
[SPEAKER_02]: And mind you, this was about seven hours after I drove to San Francisco and back.

249
00:26:54,973 --> 00:27:03,742
[SPEAKER_02]: So I got back today and I'm tired and just hungry because I haven't eaten that much today and yesterday and...

250
00:27:04,803 --> 00:27:05,803
[SPEAKER_02]: Just sucks.

251
00:27:05,984 --> 00:27:07,905
[SPEAKER_02]: And then this week is going to suck more.

252
00:27:07,925 --> 00:27:11,588
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just one big huge thing of suckage.

253
00:27:11,728 --> 00:27:16,071
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Comcast decided, you know, hey, we're not going to hook up the cable right.

254
00:27:16,151 --> 00:27:18,093
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, that didn't work all week.

255
00:27:18,173 --> 00:27:20,715
[SPEAKER_02]: So I couldn't actually play Final Fantasy XI or anything.

256
00:27:21,415 --> 00:27:22,256
[SPEAKER_02]: So that sucked.

257
00:27:22,816 --> 00:27:24,318
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can get back to that finally.

258
00:27:24,898 --> 00:27:27,800
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, what else?

259
00:27:28,421 --> 00:27:29,261
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

260
00:27:29,321 --> 00:27:30,743
[SPEAKER_02]: Not really much of anything.

261
00:27:30,763 --> 00:27:33,685
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Jonas didn't show up with food.

262
00:27:35,526 --> 00:27:39,047
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he was going to come tonight and bring food, and he's probably the only person in town that didn't show up tonight.

263
00:27:39,467 --> 00:27:39,987
[SPEAKER_02]: That's alright, though.

264
00:27:40,067 --> 00:27:44,989
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if you make a commitment to bring food, goddammit, he better show up.

265
00:27:46,129 --> 00:27:47,470
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I count on this food.

266
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:49,551
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

267
00:27:50,671 --> 00:27:52,171
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, it sucked.

268
00:27:52,191 --> 00:27:56,933
[SPEAKER_02]: Today I got to hang out with Nelly's grandparents, who can't speak any English, in fact.

269
00:27:57,433 --> 00:27:59,634
[SPEAKER_02]: They go, we can't speak English.

270
00:27:59,774 --> 00:28:01,495
[SPEAKER_02]: And English was the first thing they said to me.

271
00:28:02,295 --> 00:28:02,955
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was like, okay.

272
00:28:03,296 --> 00:28:04,816
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're all, you can't speak English?

273
00:28:05,817 --> 00:28:09,818
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they didn't know how to say, you know, can you speak Russian?

274
00:28:09,898 --> 00:28:11,319
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're like, you can't.

275
00:28:12,419 --> 00:28:13,600
[SPEAKER_02]: Or, can you speak English?

276
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,821
[SPEAKER_02]: And then she kind of shook her head, like, no, that's not right.

277
00:28:17,141 --> 00:28:17,341
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

278
00:28:17,361 --> 00:28:19,682
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, ah, wrong words!

279
00:28:21,003 --> 00:28:23,324
[SPEAKER_02]: And then she, oh, that was interesting.

280
00:28:23,344 --> 00:28:24,504
[SPEAKER_02]: Tetris?

281
00:28:24,524 --> 00:28:25,024
[SPEAKER_02]: Tetris?

282
00:28:28,903 --> 00:28:33,884
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's not the international... It's the international game of peace, didn't you know?

283
00:28:34,664 --> 00:28:39,226
[SPEAKER_02]: You should have whipped out your copy of Tetris and been all, Do you understand, Tetris?

284
00:28:40,106 --> 00:28:43,947
[SPEAKER_02]: No, instead I played Ridge Racer and it's getting goddamn hard now.

285
00:28:44,207 --> 00:28:51,749
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you beat Pro Circuit 18, that's pretty much the actual official end of the game.

286
00:28:52,109 --> 00:28:54,369
[SPEAKER_02]: And then from there on, it's all really hard shit.

287
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:57,150
[SPEAKER_02]: So I got to beat the devil car today.

288
00:28:57,899 --> 00:29:01,101
[SPEAKER_02]: That sucked, because it just uses nitros constantly.

289
00:29:01,581 --> 00:29:05,203
[SPEAKER_02]: But I rock, and I beat it four times, so I eventually got that.

290
00:29:05,623 --> 00:29:09,165
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I unlocked the Super Rally X car, which is all pixelated.

291
00:29:09,565 --> 00:29:10,846
[SPEAKER_02]: It has blocky wheels.

292
00:29:11,286 --> 00:29:11,806
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funny.

293
00:29:12,427 --> 00:29:13,287
[SPEAKER_02]: So I got that, too.

294
00:29:13,467 --> 00:29:13,927
[SPEAKER_02]: That was fun.

295
00:29:14,248 --> 00:29:15,528
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a comment from the chatroom.

296
00:29:17,409 --> 00:29:19,731
[SPEAKER_02]: www.orangelandradio.com Click on chat.

297
00:29:19,771 --> 00:29:23,232
[SPEAKER_02]: Legend of Zaku says, Loki, I dare you to take some of Jamie's Vicodin.

298
00:29:24,613 --> 00:29:26,234
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't swallow pills, so no.

299
00:29:27,256 --> 00:29:32,040
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, she's shouting no from the bathroom Yeah, she's shouting no from the bathroom

300
00:29:46,212 --> 00:29:52,854
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I said to myself, because I was exhausted, you know, after driving all day and just, it just sucked.

301
00:29:53,354 --> 00:29:56,015
[SPEAKER_02]: So I laid down, like, I'm just going to lay down for a second.

302
00:29:56,616 --> 00:30:04,358
[SPEAKER_02]: My mom calls me at like 6.15, says, hey, you know, she's trying to talk to me about the newspaper article because I left a message for her.

303
00:30:04,378 --> 00:30:06,319
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, oh shit, I got to go.

304
00:30:06,339 --> 00:30:08,800
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm supposed to be at the show already.

305
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:09,840
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn it.

306
00:30:10,421 --> 00:30:17,446
[SPEAKER_02]: So then I get here, I have to park way the fuck down the road, and for some reason I thought Rob's apartment number was like something else than it was.

307
00:30:17,466 --> 00:30:20,088
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm walking around going, where the fuck is it?

308
00:30:20,188 --> 00:30:21,929
[SPEAKER_02]: All these goddamn buildings look the same!

309
00:30:22,509 --> 00:30:23,230
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, this sucks!

310
00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:24,911
[SPEAKER_02]: I live in total suburban apartment.

311
00:30:24,931 --> 00:30:27,613
[SPEAKER_02]: So then I walk down to the end, I'm like, okay, count the buildings.

312
00:30:29,154 --> 00:30:30,375
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay, here we go, here we go.

313
00:30:30,948 --> 00:30:32,809
[SPEAKER_02]: And then so, yeah, but that sucked.

314
00:30:36,232 --> 00:30:37,033
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just tired.

315
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:38,073
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really tired.

316
00:30:38,093 --> 00:30:50,262
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we'll get into that all later, you know, about all the wonderful things that you encounter while driving, long distances, mainly bad drivers, you know, all that to come later on.

317
00:30:50,783 --> 00:30:51,123
[SPEAKER_02]: Lovely.

318
00:30:51,643 --> 00:30:51,963
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

319
00:30:52,584 --> 00:30:53,264
[SPEAKER_02]: Who else is in here?

320
00:30:53,324 --> 00:30:56,547
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go over to Arcadian42 who joined us, snuck in there a little bit.

321
00:30:56,587 --> 00:30:57,107
[SPEAKER_02]: How was your week?

322
00:30:57,127 --> 00:30:58,048
[SPEAKER_02]: How was your day, sir?

323
00:30:59,166 --> 00:31:02,007
[SPEAKER_26]: Last week I went to Jamie's party that was last Saturday.

324
00:31:02,027 --> 00:31:03,807
[SPEAKER_26]: It was pretty fun to go down there.

325
00:31:04,747 --> 00:31:09,028
[SPEAKER_26]: To MGL and Dave and Buster's.

326
00:31:09,048 --> 00:31:10,569
[SPEAKER_26]: They didn't go until since last year.

327
00:31:11,329 --> 00:31:12,269
[SPEAKER_26]: Played games and stuff like that.

328
00:31:12,689 --> 00:31:14,210
[SPEAKER_26]: Most of this week was just work.

329
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:18,711
[SPEAKER_26]: Getting prepared for our boat loss to go to Europe for three weeks.

330
00:31:20,751 --> 00:31:22,132
[SPEAKER_26]: And so that was that.

331
00:31:23,092 --> 00:31:27,393
[SPEAKER_26]: Other than that, on Friday I went and saw Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, which is a pretty good movie.

332
00:31:28,033 --> 00:31:28,353
[SPEAKER_26]: It was a

333
00:31:28,783 --> 00:31:31,945
[SPEAKER_26]: That was a very good adaption of the books.

334
00:31:33,806 --> 00:31:37,269
[SPEAKER_26]: Sort of draws from all the books, but mostly, of course, follows the first one.

335
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:42,332
[SPEAKER_26]: And then yesterday didn't do much, and today didn't do much, and game here.

336
00:31:44,754 --> 00:31:49,537
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's go over to Ice Queen, if he can take a minute away from PictoChat.

337
00:31:49,557 --> 00:31:50,298
[SPEAKER_02]: How was your week, how was your day?

338
00:31:50,928 --> 00:31:53,209
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, it was just wonderfully entertaining.

339
00:31:54,369 --> 00:31:57,610
[SPEAKER_22]: Actually, the past three weeks have been, you know, pretty much wonderfully entertaining.

340
00:31:58,251 --> 00:32:05,713
[SPEAKER_22]: I have, in the last three weeks, spent over $1,000 on my truck, that piece of shit that has no grill, whatever you call it, on the front.

341
00:32:06,213 --> 00:32:10,115
[SPEAKER_22]: So you look at the front of the truck and you see the radiator, which is absolutely lovely.

342
00:32:11,195 --> 00:32:15,456
[SPEAKER_22]: After that, I pretty much just have been working.

343
00:32:15,837 --> 00:32:16,617
[SPEAKER_22]: Lovely new job.

344
00:32:17,495 --> 00:32:20,536
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm a paper pusher for 10 bucks an hour, woohoo.

345
00:32:23,416 --> 00:32:24,376
[SPEAKER_22]: Other than that, not much.

346
00:32:24,516 --> 00:32:28,157
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh yeah, I decided to try to get clever with my computer.

347
00:32:28,517 --> 00:32:33,698
[SPEAKER_22]: It's had some viruses on there that aren't being detected and fixed by the Norton antivirus.

348
00:32:34,038 --> 00:32:45,461
[SPEAKER_22]: So I went in there on Friday night and followed an online chat, or an online FAQ regarding how to fix this specific virus, the isass.exe.

349
00:32:46,141 --> 00:32:46,781
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, and...

350
00:32:47,888 --> 00:33:00,237
[SPEAKER_22]: Not knowing any better, the fact told me that I should go ahead and go into the safe mode under administrator and change the permissions for the user to deny.

351
00:33:00,938 --> 00:33:17,010
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, me not being any more aware than I was, I went ahead and did that, which then locked up all of my Windows files, no longer had access to explorer.exe as the process, so I have no desktop, had no start menu.

352
00:33:17,873 --> 00:33:23,014
[SPEAKER_22]: and I had no access to the MS config feature, which would not allow me to go back in and change my permissions.

353
00:33:23,054 --> 00:33:27,515
[SPEAKER_22]: So I spent the whole weekend pretty much just going through my computer.

354
00:33:28,736 --> 00:33:29,696
[SPEAKER_22]: Neil, you are a dork.

355
00:33:30,936 --> 00:33:37,198
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyway, I went through and actually Neil helped me out quite a bit, did most of the work.

356
00:33:37,238 --> 00:33:40,779
[SPEAKER_22]: He went in, added the software back in there and got everything working again.

357
00:33:40,819 --> 00:33:46,660
[SPEAKER_22]: So now I'm just waiting on the operating system to load back up and hopefully I'll have my computer

358
00:33:47,589 --> 00:33:49,390
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, and yeah, World of Warcraft.

359
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:50,390
[SPEAKER_22]: I started playing that.

360
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:51,490
[SPEAKER_22]: That game rocks.

361
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:57,872
[SPEAKER_22]: It's better than Final Fantasy XI, only because you can actually solo and not have to worry about it.

362
00:33:58,592 --> 00:33:59,553
[SPEAKER_22]: So yes, it does.

363
00:33:59,613 --> 00:34:00,933
[SPEAKER_22]: Brad said that doesn't make a game better.

364
00:34:01,493 --> 00:34:02,053
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, it does.

365
00:34:02,494 --> 00:34:03,214
[SPEAKER_22]: I am antisocial.

366
00:34:03,234 --> 00:34:03,814
[SPEAKER_22]: I hate people.

367
00:34:04,594 --> 00:34:06,575
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm still waiting for Ragnarok 2.

368
00:34:07,355 --> 00:34:12,157
[SPEAKER_29]: Then it makes the game more suited for you, because other people like to play multiplayer.

369
00:34:12,197 --> 00:34:16,618
[SPEAKER_29]: The only games suited for antisocial people are those that are offline.

370
00:34:18,522 --> 00:34:19,803
[SPEAKER_29]: Oh, you mean just all other video games?

371
00:34:20,023 --> 00:34:20,223
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

372
00:34:21,063 --> 00:34:21,303
[SPEAKER_29]: Okay.

373
00:34:21,384 --> 00:34:25,205
[SPEAKER_20]: You can play Ragnarok Online completely antisocial, because I leveled myself into the 80s.

374
00:34:25,446 --> 00:34:25,626
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah.

375
00:34:25,726 --> 00:34:26,186
[SPEAKER_29]: By myself.

376
00:34:26,326 --> 00:34:30,208
[SPEAKER_29]: Oh, Ragnarok Online's the ultimate solo online RPG.

377
00:34:32,449 --> 00:34:38,792
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't know, actually, this Guild Wars game everybody's been talking about sounds like a very solo-friendly game.

378
00:34:39,073 --> 00:34:40,713
[SPEAKER_20]: The Blue Burst beta will be out in a few weeks.

379
00:34:41,814 --> 00:34:43,615
[SPEAKER_29]: But do we get to play Blue Burst?

380
00:34:44,575 --> 00:34:44,956
[SPEAKER_20]: No, US beta.

381
00:34:46,021 --> 00:34:47,683
[SPEAKER_29]: Do we have to pay monthly fees to play it?

382
00:34:47,883 --> 00:34:48,483
[SPEAKER_20]: Not for the beta.

383
00:34:48,944 --> 00:34:49,084
[SPEAKER_29]: Oh.

384
00:34:49,784 --> 00:34:50,065
[SPEAKER_29]: Okay.

385
00:34:50,385 --> 00:34:51,126
[SPEAKER_29]: Well, anyway.

386
00:34:52,627 --> 00:34:53,207
[SPEAKER_29]: What are you doing?

387
00:34:53,227 --> 00:34:56,010
[SPEAKER_29]: You're sitting there playing as DS, and you should be doing a radio show.

388
00:34:56,791 --> 00:34:58,892
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to join the PictoChat orgy, so shoot me.

389
00:34:58,932 --> 00:34:59,633
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, don't go anywhere.

390
00:34:59,653 --> 00:35:00,033
[SPEAKER_02]: How was your week?

391
00:35:00,053 --> 00:35:00,514
[SPEAKER_02]: How was your day?

392
00:35:00,654 --> 00:35:01,094
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you still?

393
00:35:02,596 --> 00:35:03,336
[SPEAKER_29]: Oh, fabulous.

394
00:35:04,337 --> 00:35:07,400
[SPEAKER_29]: Um, no, it's been kind of sucky, uh,

395
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:18,143
[SPEAKER_29]: Me and the Rice Princess both have jobs now, and it's kind of hard to, when you only have one vehicle, to get everybody where they need to go.

396
00:35:18,223 --> 00:35:28,226
[SPEAKER_29]: So we've been looking for a car, and every single time we go to go check out a car, it is apparent within a few minutes that the people do not know what they're talking about and do not know how to take care of their vehicles.

397
00:35:28,907 --> 00:35:30,567
[SPEAKER_29]: So, yeah.

398
00:35:31,868 --> 00:35:32,528
[SPEAKER_29]: So far, no luck.

399
00:35:34,391 --> 00:35:36,392
[SPEAKER_29]: Oh, I went and saw Hitchhiker's Guide also today.

400
00:35:36,992 --> 00:35:37,733
[SPEAKER_29]: We both went and saw it.

401
00:35:38,373 --> 00:35:38,893
[SPEAKER_29]: And it was good.

402
00:35:39,213 --> 00:35:39,533
[SPEAKER_29]: Liked it.

403
00:35:41,374 --> 00:35:44,355
[SPEAKER_29]: I think it's a sci-fi movie for even non-sci-fi fans.

404
00:35:44,775 --> 00:35:45,716
[SPEAKER_29]: Like, even they would like it.

405
00:35:46,316 --> 00:35:48,677
[SPEAKER_02]: My favorite part, and it's a big spoiler.

406
00:35:49,537 --> 00:35:50,498
[SPEAKER_29]: I feel like a sofa.

407
00:35:50,538 --> 00:35:51,318
[SPEAKER_29]: I think I'm a sofa.

408
00:35:53,699 --> 00:35:55,980
[SPEAKER_02]: That one's pretty funny, but I love the whale.

409
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,181
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes, yes, the whale.

410
00:35:58,221 --> 00:35:58,941
[SPEAKER_29]: It's not a spoiler.

411
00:36:01,007 --> 00:36:04,488
[SPEAKER_29]: Well, no, I doubt anybody, like, not many, many people have read this book.

412
00:36:04,508 --> 00:36:06,129
[SPEAKER_29]: It's kind of a cult thing.

413
00:36:07,249 --> 00:36:07,449
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah.

414
00:36:07,469 --> 00:36:10,290
[SPEAKER_19]: A bunch of people have read Hedgehog, Crash Guard.

415
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:18,113
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah, like, but, when you say a bunch of people have read it, it's like, nothing compared to, like, how many people have read the Bible.

416
00:36:18,753 --> 00:36:29,257
[SPEAKER_29]: You know, just because, like, a few thousand people here and there have read a book, that may be more than I have ever met in my life, but hey, it's... Yeah, it's not a huge thing, so, whatever.

417
00:36:30,751 --> 00:36:35,956
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to share with the chat room that they're not the only ones who feel like they have not seen the movie because I have not seen the movie.

418
00:36:36,176 --> 00:36:37,858
[SPEAKER_02]: So don't feel too left out, you guys.

419
00:36:38,438 --> 00:36:39,259
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll see it eventually.

420
00:36:39,519 --> 00:36:40,480
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you see Kung Fu Hustle?

421
00:36:41,461 --> 00:36:41,942
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh my god!

422
00:36:42,042 --> 00:36:43,143
[SPEAKER_25]: Go see Kung Fu Hustle now!

423
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:51,170
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, if I had to choose between movies to see, the one I went and saw, The Hitchhiker's Guide, I would have rather seen Kung Fu Hustle.

424
00:36:51,931 --> 00:36:54,894
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I haven't seen Kung Fu Hustle yet, but I saw Hitchhiker's Guide and...

425
00:36:55,692 --> 00:36:58,275
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Kung Fu Hustle's friggin' awesome.

426
00:36:58,375 --> 00:36:59,356
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I want to see?

427
00:36:59,877 --> 00:37:03,561
[SPEAKER_02]: What I would like to see is not paying $10 to go to a goddamn movie.

428
00:37:03,661 --> 00:37:04,462
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I would like to see.

429
00:37:04,602 --> 00:37:05,523
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't pay for it.

430
00:37:05,623 --> 00:37:06,544
[SPEAKER_29]: Like, you need to do that.

431
00:37:06,564 --> 00:37:11,950
[SPEAKER_29]: You just go find the attractive-looking gay guy at the movie theater place and just say, Hey...

432
00:37:13,423 --> 00:37:15,984
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because that's the universal mating call, you know.

433
00:37:16,344 --> 00:37:19,085
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, what the fuck is wrong with you?

434
00:37:19,866 --> 00:37:25,368
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, my week and my day, it's just been very busy with all the moving stuff that's going on.

435
00:37:27,568 --> 00:37:28,549
[SPEAKER_02]: What more can be said?

436
00:37:28,689 --> 00:37:36,632
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just so busy, but I'm so happy to have it all done, and I'm finally moved in here, and I'm getting comfortable in here and all that, and

437
00:37:37,799 --> 00:37:43,504
[SPEAKER_02]: Finally, things will settle down, and then E3 is just around the corner, and then we get to go into panic mode again, so that should be exciting.

438
00:37:44,024 --> 00:37:44,765
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see what happens.

439
00:37:45,926 --> 00:37:46,226
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

440
00:37:47,107 --> 00:37:53,171
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, what we're going to do now, and I'm still adjusting the sound levels, kind of as we go along here, so I apologize.

441
00:37:54,472 --> 00:37:55,573
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this my mic here?

442
00:37:56,014 --> 00:37:56,354
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

443
00:37:57,315 --> 00:37:58,496
[SPEAKER_25]: Maybe you should figure it out.

444
00:37:59,116 --> 00:37:59,597
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

445
00:37:59,757 --> 00:38:00,598
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so lost.

446
00:38:00,698 --> 00:38:08,988
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, what we're going to do now is we're going to take a break and we're going to play some new poppin' music during this break.

447
00:38:09,028 --> 00:38:09,789
[SPEAKER_02]: It's brand new.

448
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:11,070
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't played this on the station yet.

449
00:38:11,471 --> 00:38:12,432
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Poppin' Music 12.

450
00:38:13,988 --> 00:38:18,469
[SPEAKER_02]: Although it's really Papa Music Iroha, but it's just freaking Papa Music 12.

451
00:38:18,509 --> 00:38:22,690
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just trying to give it new names so that you'll forget that there's so damn many of these games.

452
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:23,830
[SPEAKER_02]: Like 2DX.

453
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:26,331
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but there's a lot of good music in this one.

454
00:38:27,871 --> 00:38:31,852
[SPEAKER_02]: Starting off with a remix of Star Mine, it's pretty interesting, so I'm going to start off with that.

455
00:38:31,992 --> 00:38:34,293
[SPEAKER_02]: Also in this, you're going to hear some new Akira Yamaoka.

456
00:38:35,353 --> 00:38:40,594
[SPEAKER_02]: A remix of the theme from Goemon is in here, and then a new Good Cool song is in here as well.

457
00:38:41,015 --> 00:38:42,635
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to hear all that during this break.

458
00:38:43,235 --> 00:38:51,436
[SPEAKER_02]: and we'll be back with more Orange Lounge Radio Orange Lounge Radio

Thanks for watching!

463
00:42:44,724 --> 00:42:45,344
[SPEAKER_17]: Goyodam!

464
00:42:45,604 --> 00:42:45,984
[SPEAKER_17]: Goyodam!

465
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:39,313
Thank you for watching.

466
00:44:20,131 --> 00:44:21,369
Thanks for watching!

467
00:45:55,081 --> 00:45:56,349
[SPEAKER_06]: Subtitles by the Amara.org community

468
00:46:33,577 --> 00:46:39,381
[SPEAKER_01]: Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio Because real radio makes Captain Jack cry

469
00:46:43,834 --> 00:46:44,514
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Lounge Radio

470
00:47:02,435 --> 00:47:03,556
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

471
00:47:23,158 --> 00:47:23,618
[SPEAKER_02]: Move this way.

472
00:47:23,658 --> 00:47:24,599
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, don't hit the wall.

473
00:47:24,639 --> 00:47:25,059
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't do it.

474
00:47:25,179 --> 00:47:27,201
[SPEAKER_20]: I greatly appreciate the presence of the chair in here.

475
00:47:27,321 --> 00:47:27,661
[SPEAKER_02]: That's nice.

476
00:47:27,701 --> 00:47:29,262
[SPEAKER_02]: And then behind DarkSakura.

477
00:47:29,282 --> 00:47:33,064
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, she doesn't let us put her on the webcam, so we can't really show you, but maybe we'll take a picture or something later.

478
00:47:33,404 --> 00:47:37,667
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can see the Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back poster that says, All you motherfuckers are going to pay.

479
00:47:37,707 --> 00:47:38,708
[SPEAKER_02]: You are the ones who are the ball lickers.

480
00:47:38,968 --> 00:47:42,310
[SPEAKER_02]: We have that right behind Jamie's chair, appropriately enough, I think, for her.

481
00:47:42,630 --> 00:47:44,611
[SPEAKER_20]: You are the ones who are the ball lickers.

482
00:47:44,751 --> 00:47:45,171
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

483
00:47:46,552 --> 00:47:51,375
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, so during the break there, we were listening to some music from the new pop and music, Uroha.

484
00:47:51,755 --> 00:47:52,296
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you guys think?

485
00:47:54,383 --> 00:47:54,943
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.

486
00:47:55,323 --> 00:47:55,924
[SPEAKER_02]: It sucked.

487
00:47:55,964 --> 00:47:57,825
[SPEAKER_02]: It sucked.

488
00:47:58,245 --> 00:47:59,545
[SPEAKER_02]: The Starmine remix, you guys didn't like it?

489
00:48:00,386 --> 00:48:01,566
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was cute.

490
00:48:02,247 --> 00:48:03,087
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't think it's that bad.

491
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:05,508
[SPEAKER_29]: I didn't hear the Starmine one.

492
00:48:05,528 --> 00:48:06,469
[SPEAKER_29]: I only saw the Goemon one.

493
00:48:07,069 --> 00:48:07,289
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

494
00:48:07,529 --> 00:48:08,870
[SPEAKER_02]: The Goemon one was excellent.

495
00:48:08,890 --> 00:48:10,450
[SPEAKER_02]: What did you think of the Kiriyamaoka track?

496
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:11,851
[SPEAKER_02]: There's two of them in pop music.

497
00:48:11,891 --> 00:48:12,311
[SPEAKER_02]: I played one.

498
00:48:14,632 --> 00:48:17,714
[SPEAKER_02]: It was that second song that played in between the Goemon and the first one.

499
00:48:18,854 --> 00:48:20,375
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's the other one, not Ryusei Honey.

500
00:48:20,743 --> 00:48:29,066
[SPEAKER_29]: I couldn't pass that song for the longest time because of the crack baby I had to have somebody hold a towel over the video and then I could pass it

501
00:48:49,608 --> 00:48:50,549
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

502
00:49:20,922 --> 00:49:21,162
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah.

503
00:49:21,262 --> 00:49:22,323
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, unless you're in the play.

504
00:49:23,024 --> 00:49:24,065
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah, unless you're in the play.

505
00:49:24,686 --> 00:49:27,448
[SPEAKER_29]: I think it's bugging the hell out of you just because you can actually hear your voice now.

506
00:49:27,969 --> 00:49:30,191
[SPEAKER_30]: It's different, and I don't like different things.

507
00:49:30,311 --> 00:49:31,192
[SPEAKER_30]: That's my problem.

508
00:49:32,333 --> 00:49:33,374
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, you, you're different.

509
00:49:33,434 --> 00:49:33,775
[SPEAKER_02]: Get out.

510
00:49:34,615 --> 00:49:35,256
[SPEAKER_29]: Let's beat him up.

511
00:49:35,296 --> 00:49:35,797
[SPEAKER_29]: He's different.

512
00:49:38,059 --> 00:49:38,319
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

513
00:49:38,639 --> 00:49:40,101
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not wearing a silly hat.

514
00:49:41,033 --> 00:49:42,314
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura's birthday party

515
00:50:03,167 --> 00:50:09,996
[SPEAKER_02]: But we went over to Milpitas Golf Land to play and I saw Drum Mania V and I was like, hey, it's Drum Mania and I fucking suck at it, so I'm gonna go over here to Guitar Freaks.

516
00:50:10,297 --> 00:50:13,842
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't even bother to check out V. So, how is the V series?

517
00:50:13,882 --> 00:50:14,783
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't even really looked at it.

518
00:50:15,754 --> 00:50:19,957
[SPEAKER_29]: Well, I only really got one play in because I was running low on time there.

519
00:50:20,218 --> 00:50:25,382
[SPEAKER_29]: So I only got one play at Guitar Freaks V. They didn't have Drum Mania V at our golf land up here in Roseville.

520
00:50:26,883 --> 00:50:28,364
[SPEAKER_29]: So that's unfortunate.

521
00:50:29,025 --> 00:50:30,446
[SPEAKER_29]: I prefer Drum Mania over Guitar Freaks.

522
00:50:30,466 --> 00:50:30,866
[SPEAKER_29]: So whatever.

523
00:50:30,926 --> 00:50:32,808
[SPEAKER_29]: I got to play one game of Guitar Freaks V.

524
00:50:33,448 --> 00:50:38,611
[SPEAKER_29]: The song selection, I think, is better than some of the previous ones.

525
00:50:38,831 --> 00:50:44,415
[SPEAKER_29]: Because to me, after Guitar Freaks 5, the song selection has kind of gone downhill.

526
00:50:44,475 --> 00:50:47,776
[SPEAKER_29]: I mean, when they got rid of... Was it...

527
00:50:49,458 --> 00:50:50,258
[SPEAKER_29]: Haru's Spring

528
00:51:06,773 --> 00:51:08,154
[SPEAKER_29]: So it's good.

529
00:51:08,514 --> 00:51:10,475
[SPEAKER_29]: The videos are definitely nice.

530
00:51:10,715 --> 00:51:17,139
[SPEAKER_29]: They added that nice quality full motion video and things like that that was in 2DX.

531
00:51:17,699 --> 00:51:21,181
[SPEAKER_29]: That's nice, but you don't really have time to sit there and look at the videos when you're playing the game.

532
00:51:21,301 --> 00:51:27,365
[SPEAKER_29]: So it's not really a very interesting new addition or useful addition.

533
00:51:27,825 --> 00:51:31,229
[SPEAKER_29]: Other than that, you know, it seems like it's pretty much just the same old Guitar Freaks.

534
00:51:31,269 --> 00:51:45,645
[SPEAKER_29]: It's got, looks like the resolution looks higher, you know, it looks more clear, so you're looking at the notes, look like they scroll smoother, and it's like the fifth mix of Guitar Freaks, basically, like GDR fifth mix, you know, how they added that.

535
00:51:46,486 --> 00:51:48,188
[SPEAKER_29]: I mean, but other than that, it's no real big

536
00:51:48,632 --> 00:51:57,240
[SPEAKER_29]: Woo-ha, wow, awesome new Guitar Freaks, so... I'll have to go check out the Drum Mania V first before I can give my final answer.

537
00:51:57,260 --> 00:51:58,121
[SPEAKER_29]: Because I want to play a session.

538
00:51:58,161 --> 00:51:59,522
[SPEAKER_29]: I haven't played a session in a long time.

539
00:52:01,584 --> 00:52:02,205
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, what's up with that?

540
00:52:02,225 --> 00:52:08,310
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, Golfland and all those places don't really have, like, the session mode like they used to, and the session was so cool when they had it, and now it's gone.

541
00:52:09,231 --> 00:52:14,516
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah, they really should get a Keyboard Mania V to go with the Guitar Freaks Drum Mania, because...

542
00:52:15,165 --> 00:52:18,307
[SPEAKER_29]: The Keyboard Mania may not have been nearly as popular as the other games.

543
00:52:19,047 --> 00:52:21,048
[SPEAKER_29]: It was fun to have the four-person session.

544
00:52:21,248 --> 00:52:22,809
[SPEAKER_29]: That was always good times.

545
00:52:23,990 --> 00:52:25,251
[SPEAKER_20]: I still want Sax Mania.

546
00:52:26,091 --> 00:52:27,352
[SPEAKER_29]: Sax Mania, oh yeah.

547
00:52:28,432 --> 00:52:28,892
[SPEAKER_29]: Or what was it?

548
00:52:28,913 --> 00:52:29,533
[SPEAKER_20]: Sax Freaks.

549
00:52:29,613 --> 00:52:30,393
[SPEAKER_29]: What was the other one?

550
00:52:30,453 --> 00:52:32,975
[SPEAKER_29]: It was the Head Mania?

551
00:52:33,775 --> 00:52:35,156
[SPEAKER_29]: The pole that you just, yeah, anyway.

552
00:52:35,666 --> 00:52:36,486
[SPEAKER_02]: Sax Machine.

553
00:52:37,527 --> 00:52:37,787
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

554
00:52:38,607 --> 00:52:45,790
[SPEAKER_02]: Arcadian42, I know you're big on the Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania series, so I'm curious, you at Milpitas Golf Line got to check out Drum Mania Vs, so I'm kind of curious what you thought.

555
00:52:47,031 --> 00:52:49,232
[SPEAKER_26]: That's pretty much similar, it seems.

556
00:52:50,292 --> 00:52:53,454
[SPEAKER_26]: I didn't really notice the videos or anything, just because I wasn't really looking at them.

557
00:52:53,494 --> 00:52:55,194
[SPEAKER_26]: I was looking through the song list.

558
00:52:55,214 --> 00:52:56,655
[SPEAKER_26]: Song list seems pretty good.

559
00:52:57,355 --> 00:53:02,277
[SPEAKER_26]: I noticed there was a lot of older songs that they brought back from various older mixes.

560
00:53:02,978 --> 00:53:03,458
[SPEAKER_26]: So, like,

561
00:53:04,167 --> 00:53:06,908
[SPEAKER_26]: Void, and what was the other one I really noticed?

562
00:53:08,468 --> 00:53:09,208
[SPEAKER_26]: Crap, I can't remember.

563
00:53:09,348 --> 00:53:10,949
[SPEAKER_26]: Wild Ride, which only showed up in one.

564
00:53:10,969 --> 00:53:14,630
[SPEAKER_26]: It was like a special track in one of them that only showed up in that one.

565
00:53:14,650 --> 00:53:15,850
[SPEAKER_26]: It was like seventh mix, I think.

566
00:53:17,951 --> 00:53:19,651
[SPEAKER_26]: And, yeah, it seemed pretty good.

567
00:53:20,391 --> 00:53:24,292
[SPEAKER_26]: The way they do the song select, it only shows like five or six songs at a time.

568
00:53:24,312 --> 00:53:27,813
[SPEAKER_26]: It makes it harder to see what songs are in it, so that was probably the bad thing about it.

569
00:53:29,194 --> 00:53:30,574
[SPEAKER_26]: But otherwise, it seemed pretty cool.

570
00:53:31,806 --> 00:53:39,134
[SPEAKER_26]: I'd have to play it more, because I only played it twice, and then we had to run off to Dave & Buster's, so I didn't get to have that much chance to play it.

571
00:53:39,415 --> 00:53:45,742
[SPEAKER_26]: I haven't been to Roseville Golf Land in like two months, so I can't really comment on Guitar Freaks V yet.

572
00:53:47,124 --> 00:53:48,225
[SPEAKER_26]: But, yeah, it seemed all right.

573
00:53:50,662 --> 00:53:57,744
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what's interesting is that while you guys were checking out V, I was actually checking out 11th Mix of Guitar Freaks finally for the first time.

574
00:53:58,264 --> 00:54:03,766
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's fun, it's very pink, but you know, I had a good time and I played it, so you know, what can I say.

575
00:54:03,886 --> 00:54:06,666
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you check out any of those Guitar Freaks, Guitar Mania?

576
00:54:06,846 --> 00:54:07,567
[SPEAKER_02]: I played Beat Mania.

577
00:54:08,087 --> 00:54:08,847
[SPEAKER_02]: You were playing Beat Mania?

578
00:54:09,087 --> 00:54:09,747
[SPEAKER_02]: Beat Mania the final?

579
00:54:10,007 --> 00:54:10,187
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

580
00:54:10,307 --> 00:54:11,328
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that the first time you checked that out?

581
00:54:11,768 --> 00:54:11,908
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

582
00:54:12,228 --> 00:54:12,488
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

583
00:54:12,508 --> 00:54:12,628
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

584
00:54:13,308 --> 00:54:18,210
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, one game, though, I want to kind of transition to this topic because there was another game you got to check out for the first time.

585
00:54:18,230 --> 00:54:18,650
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, God.

586
00:54:19,670 --> 00:54:20,230
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell us about it.

587
00:54:20,490 --> 00:54:22,451
[SPEAKER_20]: I played the retard game, I mean, in the groove.

588
00:54:23,851 --> 00:54:25,732
[SPEAKER_02]: And no holds barred from you, apparently.

589
00:54:27,093 --> 00:54:27,973
[SPEAKER_20]: It had good music.

590
00:54:28,553 --> 00:54:30,814
[SPEAKER_20]: Everything else about it was utter and complete ripoff.

591
00:54:31,214 --> 00:54:34,535
[SPEAKER_20]: I also don't like that you can't go backwards in the menus.

592
00:54:35,091 --> 00:54:39,813
[SPEAKER_02]: I realized that for the first time as well the other day when I fucked one of my modifiers severely.

593
00:54:39,913 --> 00:54:40,834
[SPEAKER_02]: I could not go back.

594
00:54:41,414 --> 00:54:45,696
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless there's a way you do it differently than DDR, but I figured everything else was the same as DDR.

595
00:54:46,236 --> 00:54:48,978
[SPEAKER_02]: So the way you would move back would be the same, and it doesn't work.

596
00:54:49,198 --> 00:54:49,998
[SPEAKER_29]: It was just really stupid.

597
00:54:50,018 --> 00:54:50,759
[SPEAKER_29]: Here's how you go back.

598
00:54:50,799 --> 00:54:52,539
[SPEAKER_29]: You fail your first song and put more coins in.

599
00:54:55,241 --> 00:54:57,142
[SPEAKER_02]: What an ingenious idea on how to make more money.

600
00:54:57,602 --> 00:55:00,763
[SPEAKER_20]: It really wasn't that much of an... It wasn't really an innovation at all.

601
00:55:01,023 --> 00:55:02,024
[SPEAKER_20]: And the songs were longer.

602
00:55:03,010 --> 00:55:07,651
[SPEAKER_20]: which in some cases was okay, but overall, the steps were awful.

603
00:55:07,811 --> 00:55:08,632
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, really awful.

604
00:55:08,672 --> 00:55:10,232
[SPEAKER_20]: It felt like playing a Korean mix.

605
00:55:11,332 --> 00:55:12,953
[SPEAKER_20]: Korean third?

606
00:55:13,853 --> 00:55:20,315
[SPEAKER_20]: There were some good steps in Korean third, but I'm talking about how many jumps there were in everything, which I really hate doing.

607
00:55:22,215 --> 00:55:26,597
[SPEAKER_20]: It was like playing Konami of Hawaii steps.

608
00:55:28,197 --> 00:55:29,097
[SPEAKER_20]: That's how it was.

609
00:55:29,878 --> 00:55:31,418
[SPEAKER_29]: That's a bad inside reference.

610
00:55:32,884 --> 00:55:37,169
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but you don't mean like Ultramix 2 steps, because those... I mean like Panomics.

611
00:55:38,571 --> 00:55:43,477
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, or like, um, uh, Service, or, I keep saying Service, Songpacks 1 through 6.

612
00:55:43,837 --> 00:55:44,097
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

613
00:55:44,478 --> 00:55:44,598
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

614
00:55:44,658 --> 00:55:45,379
[SPEAKER_02]: Like playing those.

615
00:55:45,559 --> 00:55:45,840
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

616
00:55:46,914 --> 00:55:48,155
[SPEAKER_02]: I keep saying Service Pack.

617
00:55:48,335 --> 00:55:50,657
[SPEAKER_02]: I always say Service Pack because I get it confused with Microsoft.

618
00:55:50,917 --> 00:55:52,258
[SPEAKER_02]: Songpacks 1 through 6 then.

619
00:55:52,678 --> 00:55:52,938
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

620
00:55:53,058 --> 00:55:53,338
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

621
00:55:53,699 --> 00:55:57,101
[SPEAKER_20]: That's how, that's, it was Konami of Hawaii Steps.

622
00:55:57,481 --> 00:56:02,785
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I've actually played in the groove probably two times, at least two times this week, if not three.

623
00:56:03,025 --> 00:56:03,285
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

624
00:56:03,325 --> 00:56:03,886
[SPEAKER_02]: I've lost count.

625
00:56:04,526 --> 00:56:06,968
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm warming up to it a little more.

626
00:56:07,915 --> 00:56:09,656
[SPEAKER_02]: But, I don't know.

627
00:56:10,636 --> 00:56:17,239
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I still, I'm like, I feel like this is just something to hold me over until the real thing is back.

628
00:56:17,579 --> 00:56:25,983
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I've gone from regular soda to diet soda, and I'm still trying to get used to that nasty aftertaste that you get from diet soda.

629
00:56:26,443 --> 00:56:27,463
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of how it is.

630
00:56:27,563 --> 00:56:32,045
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, I'm like, you know, as soon as they come out with a new flavor of soda, I'm going to go right back to it.

631
00:56:32,785 --> 00:56:34,246
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how I feel about this whole thing.

632
00:56:36,546 --> 00:56:40,330
[SPEAKER_29]: Once they put the cocaine back in the Coca-Cola, you'll be ready to go.

633
00:56:42,252 --> 00:56:44,574
[SPEAKER_20]: Then you won't need the diet because the cocaine will take care of that for you.

634
00:56:44,714 --> 00:56:45,915
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, so here's the interesting thing.

635
00:56:45,975 --> 00:56:47,957
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think it's going to be like on PlayStation 2?

636
00:56:49,779 --> 00:56:51,080
[SPEAKER_20]: I haven't put much thought into it.

637
00:56:51,741 --> 00:56:53,022
[SPEAKER_20]: It's not like I'm going to waste my money on it.

638
00:56:53,382 --> 00:56:54,203
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, here's the interesting thing.

639
00:56:54,263 --> 00:56:56,905
[SPEAKER_02]: You might want to start thinking about it because guess where we're going on Wednesday?

640
00:56:57,426 --> 00:56:58,547
[SPEAKER_20]: You and I. That's true.

641
00:56:58,627 --> 00:56:59,148
[SPEAKER_20]: There's that.

642
00:57:00,242 --> 00:57:07,468
[SPEAKER_02]: So somehow we have managed to get an invite to the In The Groove premiere party in San Francisco.

643
00:57:08,268 --> 00:57:11,251
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to go check out the In The Groove on PlayStation 2.

644
00:57:11,911 --> 00:57:12,772
[SPEAKER_02]: And here's the great thing.

645
00:57:13,312 --> 00:57:15,334
[SPEAKER_02]: The invite said, now, I haven't told you this.

646
00:57:15,374 --> 00:57:18,156
[SPEAKER_02]: I was waiting for the show to tell you this, specifically on the show.

647
00:57:18,937 --> 00:57:19,597
[SPEAKER_02]: Free drinks.

648
00:57:20,638 --> 00:57:21,599
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, cool, liquor!

649
00:57:23,220 --> 00:57:28,424
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, what I'm curious about is what if for every drink you have to say something nice about In The Groove?

650
00:57:30,427 --> 00:57:30,707
[SPEAKER_02]: Lame.

651
00:57:32,007 --> 00:57:32,988
[SPEAKER_20]: I like this song.

652
00:57:33,008 --> 00:57:34,988
[SPEAKER_20]: This song's cool, too.

653
00:57:35,008 --> 00:57:37,208
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't suck that much.

654
00:57:37,268 --> 00:57:38,729
[SPEAKER_20]: I need to download this song.

655
00:57:40,969 --> 00:57:47,951
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is interesting because one of the... My biggest problem within the group is that I... Like, half the songs don't do it for me.

656
00:57:48,651 --> 00:57:52,712
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I'm not as big on the song list, but... I like the hip-hoppy ones, actually.

657
00:57:53,552 --> 00:57:56,553
[SPEAKER_02]: See, that... I guess that's where we differ because I don't care for those tracks.

658
00:57:56,573 --> 00:57:58,113
[SPEAKER_20]: The trance I can do without because trance is...

659
00:57:59,420 --> 00:58:07,248
[SPEAKER_02]: See, I actually like the really stupid, dancey covers of Mouth and Torn and all that stuff.

660
00:58:07,508 --> 00:58:11,732
[SPEAKER_20]: I want innovation in music, and all trance is is rehashing.

661
00:58:11,913 --> 00:58:12,693
[SPEAKER_20]: That's all it is.

662
00:58:13,054 --> 00:58:15,136
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's add some synthesizer to it and call it music.

663
00:58:16,724 --> 00:58:18,346
[SPEAKER_29]: Here's the issue with trance.

664
00:58:18,406 --> 00:58:21,970
[SPEAKER_29]: It's all just disco sped up with lots of synthesizers.

665
00:58:23,071 --> 00:58:27,876
[SPEAKER_29]: Disco, you know, well, there's a lot of dancing involved in disco, so I guess it works.

666
00:58:27,957 --> 00:58:31,821
[SPEAKER_29]: But there's just not a lot of talented trance artists out there.

667
00:58:31,841 --> 00:58:34,504
[SPEAKER_29]: You gotta go to the very select few artists like...

668
00:58:35,541 --> 00:58:38,082
[SPEAKER_29]: One I'm really big on right now, Yuzo Koshiro.

669
00:58:38,302 --> 00:58:40,963
[SPEAKER_29]: He does an awesome soundtrack for that One Gun Midnight Maximum.

670
00:58:42,124 --> 00:58:44,865
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah, just very few good artists will do trance well.

671
00:58:44,925 --> 00:58:47,746
[SPEAKER_29]: So most of the time you're just going to find shitty trance tracks.

672
00:58:47,886 --> 00:58:51,127
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, like just about what you find on every single compilation out there.

673
00:58:51,267 --> 00:58:51,908
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah, exactly.

674
00:58:53,028 --> 00:59:01,672
[SPEAKER_29]: And to me, my favorite trance, the songs that I think are actually good trance songs are done by artists who don't technically, they don't really do trance typically.

675
00:59:01,852 --> 00:59:02,312
[SPEAKER_29]: They do normal...

676
00:59:02,592 --> 00:59:05,037
[SPEAKER_29]: Like Delirium, there's a song I'm really loving.

677
00:59:05,217 --> 00:59:06,018
[SPEAKER_29]: Maybe I'll tell you about it later.

678
00:59:06,038 --> 00:59:06,359
[SPEAKER_29]: Whatever.

679
00:59:08,453 --> 00:59:11,314
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, his microphone's on, but these mics are acting very weird.

680
00:59:11,334 --> 00:59:11,614
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

681
00:59:11,674 --> 00:59:16,735
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's because this one's a cardio, so it depends on... It's because Rob's too loud and Brad's too quiet.

682
00:59:17,635 --> 00:59:18,235
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what it is.

683
00:59:18,395 --> 00:59:19,636
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't make them both work.

684
00:59:19,656 --> 00:59:21,496
[SPEAKER_29]: There's no perfect medium, you know?

685
00:59:21,516 --> 00:59:22,036
[SPEAKER_02]: No, there isn't.

686
00:59:22,416 --> 00:59:30,238
[SPEAKER_02]: It's either you talk too close to the mic, you being Rob, because obviously pointing does not really, you know, show its way through radio.

687
00:59:30,978 --> 00:59:32,019
[SPEAKER_29]: There's the camera.

688
00:59:32,059 --> 00:59:32,619
[SPEAKER_29]: They can see it.

689
00:59:33,259 --> 00:59:34,379
[SPEAKER_29]: You're pointing at the camera.

690
00:59:34,419 --> 00:59:35,279
[SPEAKER_29]: You're pointing at the audience.

691
00:59:35,299 --> 00:59:35,499
[SPEAKER_02]: You!

692
00:59:35,659 --> 00:59:36,080
[SPEAKER_02]: Camera!

693
00:59:36,340 --> 00:59:37,560
[SPEAKER_02]: You are talking too loud.

694
00:59:37,620 --> 00:59:37,700
[SPEAKER_02]: No...

695
00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:48,308
[SPEAKER_02]: No, honestly, because I'm talking and I'm starting to, like, you know, static out and I'm not even hitting a peak yellow yet, which means that there's something too loud somewhere.

696
00:59:48,588 --> 00:59:51,770
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know what the hell you guys did to this board here.

697
00:59:51,790 --> 00:59:55,773
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know where to... You jinxed it with Judo Curse.

698
00:59:55,873 --> 00:59:56,394
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

699
00:59:57,915 --> 01:00:01,638
[SPEAKER_29]: But anyways... Check the levels going into the computer.

700
01:00:01,658 --> 01:00:02,378
[SPEAKER_29]: I checked.

701
01:00:02,538 --> 01:00:03,639
[SPEAKER_29]: Look at the hardware in the computer.

702
01:00:03,739 --> 01:00:04,060
[SPEAKER_29]: Jeez.

703
01:00:07,043 --> 01:00:07,423
[SPEAKER_29]: Anyways.

704
01:00:07,663 --> 01:00:08,704
[SPEAKER_29]: Turn down the mic boost.

705
01:00:09,824 --> 01:00:13,146
[SPEAKER_02]: What we might want to do is maybe do a mic shuffle back to the mics we used to have.

706
01:00:13,886 --> 01:00:14,226
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

707
01:00:14,386 --> 01:00:15,447
[SPEAKER_02]: Mic shuffle.

708
01:00:17,167 --> 01:00:20,089
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm on the mic that I used to be on and I'm still fine.

709
01:00:20,509 --> 01:00:20,929
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

710
01:00:21,069 --> 01:00:22,009
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just... It's nothing.

711
01:00:22,029 --> 01:00:22,770
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to worry about it.

712
01:00:22,830 --> 01:00:25,411
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something that I turned up and I'm trying to... Moving forward.

713
01:00:25,551 --> 01:00:26,431
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, moving on.

714
01:00:26,491 --> 01:00:27,052
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

715
01:00:27,132 --> 01:00:28,832
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, you know, the sound issues are important.

716
01:00:28,892 --> 01:00:30,053
[SPEAKER_02]: If they can't hear us, you know...

717
01:00:30,552 --> 01:00:32,053
[SPEAKER_20]: If they can't hear us, they can turn up the radio.

718
01:00:32,073 --> 01:00:39,916
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're just joining us, we are doing our first show in the brand new studio, so we've got audio issues tonight, but hopefully we will be able to make everything work out.

719
01:00:40,017 --> 01:00:42,298
[SPEAKER_02]: So just bear with us, and we'll get through this.

720
01:00:42,478 --> 01:00:44,419
[SPEAKER_02]: It also could be that these headphones suck.

721
01:00:44,659 --> 01:00:46,039
[SPEAKER_02]: It might be, so I'm not going to worry about it.

722
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:51,382
[SPEAKER_02]: The chat room has been yelling when levels are fine, I don't know, so maybe you want to pay attention to that.

723
01:00:51,402 --> 01:00:52,302
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but it's on delay.

724
01:00:52,642 --> 01:00:53,663
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know, it doesn't help.

725
01:00:54,571 --> 01:00:56,553
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's try leaving the audio here.

726
01:00:56,653 --> 01:00:58,094
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's switch back and just see what happens.

727
01:00:58,114 --> 01:00:59,315
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like our audio is okay now.

728
01:00:59,516 --> 01:00:59,856
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

729
01:01:00,296 --> 01:01:00,837
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard to tell.

730
01:01:02,779 --> 01:01:03,439
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll see what happens.

731
01:01:05,842 --> 01:01:06,382
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on.

732
01:01:07,303 --> 01:01:09,665
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have that In The Groove thing going on Wednesday.

733
01:01:10,286 --> 01:01:14,550
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's try to think what else is going on in the Bomani world right now.

734
01:01:20,379 --> 01:01:27,481
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything, DarkSakura, that you would like to see in the In the Groove release on PlayStation 2 that you didn't see in the arcade game?

735
01:01:31,082 --> 01:01:31,882
[SPEAKER_20]: Lack of suckage.

736
01:01:36,384 --> 01:01:42,726
[SPEAKER_20]: It didn't 100% suck, but honestly, it's not DDR, you know?

737
01:01:43,666 --> 01:01:45,587
[SPEAKER_20]: It's like a big rip-off of DDR.

738
01:01:45,667 --> 01:01:46,587
[SPEAKER_20]: I can't get into it.

739
01:01:47,119 --> 01:01:51,222
[SPEAKER_20]: I cannot look at that game without thinking, wow, they totally bid on DDR.

740
01:01:52,883 --> 01:01:54,043
[SPEAKER_20]: Sorry, that's how I feel.

741
01:01:56,925 --> 01:01:57,866
[SPEAKER_02]: Oops, my mic was off, sorry.

742
01:01:58,046 --> 01:01:59,166
[SPEAKER_02]: That's alright, you're welcome to your opinion.

743
01:02:02,388 --> 01:02:06,451
[SPEAKER_02]: What we're going to do now, let's move into talking about last week's show.

744
01:02:06,491 --> 01:02:12,634
[SPEAKER_02]: And last week's show, we actually had not one, but two cage matches that took place last week.

745
01:02:12,654 --> 01:02:16,697
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was a tape show, and I hope you guys were able to tune in and check it out.

746
01:02:17,407 --> 01:02:20,669
[SPEAKER_02]: And in that, we did two cage matches.

747
01:02:21,210 --> 01:02:25,152
[SPEAKER_02]: The first cage match was talking about the ultimate cage match.

748
01:02:25,552 --> 01:02:32,557
[SPEAKER_02]: In other words, we've had three songs that have been retired from Orange Lounge cage match, meaning they won four weeks in a row.

749
01:02:32,917 --> 01:02:39,822
[SPEAKER_02]: So we decided to face off each of those songs against each other and see what the ultimate cage match victor would be.

750
01:02:40,142 --> 01:02:42,784
[SPEAKER_02]: So are you guys curious to hear which song won that?

751
01:02:43,864 --> 01:02:44,125
[SPEAKER_25]: Sure.

752
01:02:44,545 --> 01:02:46,026
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, based off your votes...

753
01:02:46,824 --> 01:02:50,526
[SPEAKER_02]: on OrangeLoungeRadio.com because that's the way we voted in both cage matches this week.

754
01:02:50,947 --> 01:03:06,896
[SPEAKER_02]: The winning song of the ultimate cage match, meaning that this is just like the best song I guess you guys think we've played in the past hundred episodes we've been doing the cage match, is... Echo Image with Come Back.

755
01:03:06,916 --> 01:03:07,096
[SPEAKER_13]: Woo!

756
01:03:10,899 --> 01:03:14,762
[SPEAKER_02]: That was our ultimate cage match, because we did each song that got retired.

757
01:03:15,342 --> 01:03:16,303
[SPEAKER_02]: Pay attention, like you still.

758
01:03:17,984 --> 01:03:21,067
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so Echo Image will come back was the winner.

759
01:03:22,788 --> 01:03:32,195
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, we did another cage match, and that cage match was choosing which song should be banned from Orange Lounge Radio forever.

760
01:03:32,736 --> 01:03:33,076
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay?

761
01:03:33,556 --> 01:03:34,997
[SPEAKER_02]: And we let you guys vote on that.

762
01:03:36,318 --> 01:03:38,440
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's what we call a reverse cage match.

763
01:03:40,733 --> 01:03:42,955
[SPEAKER_02]: And you guys picked a winner.

764
01:03:42,995 --> 01:03:45,116
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess really more appropriately, it would probably be a loser.

765
01:03:46,517 --> 01:03:50,739
[SPEAKER_02]: But the songs that were up were Britney Spears with My Prerogative.

766
01:03:51,780 --> 01:03:52,660
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was Jamie's pick.

767
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:57,943
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I picked DJ Speedo featuring Wild Side with the Catch-Up song.

768
01:03:58,524 --> 01:04:03,827
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Loki picked Kids Bop Kids doing Bring Me to Life with Corky.

769
01:04:05,828 --> 01:04:06,528
[SPEAKER_02]: Wake me up.

770
01:04:07,068 --> 01:04:07,869
[SPEAKER_15]: Wake me up!

771
01:04:10,120 --> 01:04:13,562
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, do you guys want to know what song is being banned from Orange Laundry Radio forever?

772
01:04:15,263 --> 01:04:15,664
[SPEAKER_02]: Here it is.

773
01:04:22,128 --> 01:04:28,432
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Kids Bop Kids, Bring Me To Life, banned from the station forever.

774
01:04:28,552 --> 01:04:30,573
[SPEAKER_02]: Good riddance, you piece of shit song.

775
01:04:32,534 --> 01:04:32,754
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

776
01:04:33,655 --> 01:04:35,216
[SPEAKER_29]: Do you have a cage match pick today already?

777
01:04:36,297 --> 01:04:36,677
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I do.

778
01:04:39,087 --> 01:04:39,988
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it that Delirium thing?

779
01:04:40,488 --> 01:04:41,769
[SPEAKER_02]: I told you I put that song in already.

780
01:04:42,990 --> 01:04:43,230
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

781
01:04:43,850 --> 01:04:44,330
[SPEAKER_02]: Long time ago.

782
01:04:48,573 --> 01:04:49,953
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, maybe I'm confused.

783
01:04:49,973 --> 01:04:50,254
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

784
01:04:50,374 --> 01:04:50,674
[SPEAKER_02]: Who cares?

785
01:04:52,055 --> 01:04:52,675
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, anyway.

786
01:04:52,695 --> 01:04:52,735
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

787
01:04:55,762 --> 01:05:00,725
[SPEAKER_02]: What we're going to do now, we're going to go to a break, then we're going to come back and get into a couple other topics in tonight's cage match.

788
01:05:01,145 --> 01:05:11,230
[SPEAKER_02]: I figured to humor the discussion we've been having, I'll actually, and our chat room has kind of been asking for this for a little while, so I'm actually going to play some music from In the Groove for you guys.

789
01:05:12,491 --> 01:05:17,814
[SPEAKER_02]: So, enjoy, and we'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio. ...

790
01:07:14,273 --> 01:07:15,895
Thank you for watching!

791
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:48,386
Thanks for watching!

792
01:08:30,481 --> 01:08:44,555
[SPEAKER_11]: Charlie's body lets me die So please take care of yourself Don't give away everything you own Cause no one will give you back The innocence that you have lost Charlie, you're still getting a sister of mine

793
01:09:12,158 --> 01:09:13,099
Thanks for watching!

794
01:13:30,815 --> 01:13:39,278
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey guys, we're back with more Orange Lounge Radio.

795
01:13:39,318 --> 01:13:43,920
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the new promos was something else on the list of things to do that didn't get done, but we've just been busy.

796
01:13:43,960 --> 01:13:51,342
[SPEAKER_02]: You heard about our dramatic week, so, you know, we'll just get past it and, you know, do something more constructive later on.

797
01:13:51,662 --> 01:13:58,105
[SPEAKER_02]: We are going to open up the Skype line very, very soon, so head on over to www.orangeloungeradio.com and click on Interact With Us.

798
01:13:58,145 --> 01:13:59,105
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have no clue...

799
01:13:59,551 --> 01:14:03,834
[SPEAKER_02]: What I'm talking about, because that's the only way you guys are going to get to call in and interact with our station.

800
01:14:04,374 --> 01:14:06,955
[SPEAKER_02]: First, though, I want to point out the songs that we played in that break.

801
01:14:06,995 --> 01:14:15,420
[SPEAKER_02]: We played Banzai with Anubis, Missing Heart, Charlene, Smiley with Shusha, and Ka with Dawn.

802
01:14:15,580 --> 01:14:18,782
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, here's the interesting thing about Dawn.

803
01:14:19,703 --> 01:14:20,944
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hope I still have this.

804
01:14:21,024 --> 01:14:22,124
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope I didn't get rid of it.

805
01:14:22,184 --> 01:14:23,265
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be pissed if I did.

806
01:14:24,005 --> 01:14:25,907
[SPEAKER_02]: I probably did and didn't even realize it.

807
01:14:27,327 --> 01:14:28,148
[SPEAKER_02]: Shoot, I think I did.

808
01:14:29,405 --> 01:14:31,346
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me run a search real quick.

809
01:14:31,366 --> 01:14:39,050
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we actually used to spin the song Dawn on our station like a long time ago when we first started.

810
01:14:39,391 --> 01:14:45,294
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was one of those, this isn't in a Bomani game yet, but it will be someday, we think.

811
01:14:45,655 --> 01:14:48,656
[SPEAKER_02]: And heaven forbid, it actually did show up in a game.

812
01:14:49,057 --> 01:14:54,420
[SPEAKER_02]: Although it wasn't really a Bomani game, it was more of a, you know, one of Bomani game, but I don't know.

813
01:14:56,380 --> 01:14:57,482
[SPEAKER_02]: Wannabe Monty, get it?

814
01:14:57,562 --> 01:14:58,203
[SPEAKER_02]: Wannabe Monty?

815
01:14:58,384 --> 01:14:58,844
[SPEAKER_02]: Wannabe?

816
01:14:59,986 --> 01:15:01,189
[SPEAKER_02]: I read that on a forum somewhere.

817
01:15:01,209 --> 01:15:01,850
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was funny.

818
01:15:04,194 --> 01:15:05,236
[SPEAKER_02]: Darn, I wish we had it.

819
01:15:06,164 --> 01:15:08,605
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I actually, oh no no, I do have it, listen to this, listen to this.

820
01:15:08,945 --> 01:15:11,206
[SPEAKER_02]: This is dated July 23rd, 2002.

821
01:15:12,666 --> 01:15:14,707
[SPEAKER_02]: This file's dated July 23rd, 2002.

822
01:15:15,667 --> 01:15:17,447
[SPEAKER_02]: That's three years ago.

823
01:15:18,008 --> 01:15:23,089
[SPEAKER_01]: And now, an original work that could one day very well be in a Bomani game.

824
01:15:23,609 --> 01:15:26,330
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Kiel with the song Dawn.

825
01:15:26,650 --> 01:15:32,812
[SPEAKER_01]: If you like what you hear, visit www.amcast.com slash K-E-E-L.

826
01:15:34,774 --> 01:15:43,576
[SPEAKER_02]: See, that was like, I don't know how long ago, July 2002, and I don't even know if that website exists anymore, and he changed his name and all that stuff too, so very interesting.

827
01:15:43,916 --> 01:15:50,077
[SPEAKER_02]: So, let's see, we played that before it was in a music rhythm game.

828
01:15:50,177 --> 01:15:55,378
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we've had, what, three songs from our cage match that ended up in a music rhythm game that we played here first, so, you know.

829
01:15:56,298 --> 01:15:57,578
[SPEAKER_02]: I just like thinking we're cool.

830
01:15:58,198 --> 01:15:59,698
[SPEAKER_02]: Inflate my ego here a little bit, please.

831
01:16:01,819 --> 01:16:02,099
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

832
01:16:03,041 --> 01:16:04,605
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, let's do this.

833
01:16:04,625 --> 01:16:10,257
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to open up the Skype line, so go ahead and give us a call, and we'll hear from what you have to say.

834
01:16:10,277 --> 01:16:13,123
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to talk to us about what we let him talk to us about tonight.

835
01:16:15,778 --> 01:16:19,001
[SPEAKER_02]: In The Groove, The Award Show, if you guys were listening last night.

836
01:16:19,101 --> 01:16:20,563
[SPEAKER_02]: Just whatever's on your mind.

837
01:16:20,623 --> 01:16:21,203
[SPEAKER_02]: I really don't care.

838
01:16:21,343 --> 01:16:27,549
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to talk about Renee Sebastian and her chef, you know, Miss Chef is what I'd like to call her.

839
01:16:27,789 --> 01:16:28,390
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, what was it?

840
01:16:28,670 --> 01:16:31,233
[SPEAKER_02]: Those artists that played in the Live 365 Awards.

841
01:16:31,293 --> 01:16:39,460
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I had a lot of respect for those folks because they were very passionate and very talented, unlike a lot of folks I see on the television.

842
01:16:39,981 --> 01:16:40,201
[SPEAKER_02]: But...

843
01:16:41,115 --> 01:16:42,056
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so in love with you

844
01:16:57,851 --> 01:17:03,876
[SPEAKER_08]: I want you to lay me down, and start screwing me up and down, and then you're gonna come into me.

845
01:17:03,996 --> 01:17:07,119
[SPEAKER_08]: I swear to God, that was one of the lyrics, like, you're gonna come into me.

846
01:17:07,459 --> 01:17:09,501
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was like, oh my God, this chick is foul.

847
01:17:09,601 --> 01:17:11,363
[SPEAKER_08]: And the gospel people were there too.

848
01:17:11,383 --> 01:17:13,925
[SPEAKER_02]: What's great about the song is it went on too long.

849
01:17:14,005 --> 01:17:22,192
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, and then I want you up and down, up and down, around, up, down, up and around, in, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

850
01:17:22,512 --> 01:17:27,134
[SPEAKER_02]: Suddenly she was singing DDR Steps and how to find her G-spot.

851
01:17:27,734 --> 01:17:29,135
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, we're going to take a call.

852
01:17:29,175 --> 01:17:30,155
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

853
01:17:30,175 --> 01:17:30,515
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's this?

854
01:17:31,595 --> 01:17:36,917
[SPEAKER_28]: Emerging from the shadows of Imani style, your resident 2DX bastard, DarkLionXVI is here.

855
01:17:37,538 --> 01:17:39,618
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, alright, alright.

856
01:17:39,698 --> 01:17:41,059
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone doesn't need their own intro.

857
01:17:41,099 --> 01:17:44,460
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not going to do this WWE style.

858
01:17:45,761 --> 01:17:49,202
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Kinsville with the Rock is Cookin' and just play the music.

859
01:17:49,242 --> 01:17:50,242
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, go ahead.

860
01:17:50,783 --> 01:17:51,203
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

861
01:17:53,937 --> 01:17:55,278
[SPEAKER_02]: You just got told, what Emma?

862
01:17:55,358 --> 01:17:56,178
[SPEAKER_02]: He said, what Emma?

863
01:17:57,819 --> 01:17:58,799
[SPEAKER_28]: What's on your mind, Siggy?

864
01:18:01,080 --> 01:18:03,461
[SPEAKER_28]: Congratulations on your new studio.

865
01:18:04,261 --> 01:18:04,741
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

866
01:18:04,841 --> 01:18:10,103
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually kind of a little bit of a downgrade, but the apartment itself is very, very nice.

867
01:18:10,203 --> 01:18:12,204
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I'm very happy with it.

868
01:18:12,304 --> 01:18:15,045
[SPEAKER_02]: And we like being cozy, don't we, kids?

869
01:18:15,565 --> 01:18:17,526
[SPEAKER_02]: I can reach out and touch Jamie in the studio.

870
01:18:20,187 --> 01:18:20,587
[SPEAKER_08]: My knee.

871
01:18:21,227 --> 01:18:23,188
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the sound that she made when I touched her knee.

872
01:18:25,225 --> 01:18:26,105
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we like it.

873
01:18:26,145 --> 01:18:26,426
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cool.

874
01:18:26,446 --> 01:18:27,706
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to do a lot of good things here.

875
01:18:29,287 --> 01:18:29,687
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you.

876
01:18:30,447 --> 01:18:30,707
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

877
01:18:31,007 --> 01:18:31,968
[SPEAKER_02]: What else is on your mind, buddy?

878
01:18:32,548 --> 01:18:40,872
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, you know, last Friday I was able to play 2DX Red, and I was able to pass three Level 8 plus songs.

879
01:18:44,353 --> 01:18:44,813
[SPEAKER_28]: Which ones?

880
01:18:45,894 --> 01:18:49,535
[SPEAKER_28]: The three songs are Take It Easy, Setsugekka, and Rainbow Rainbow.

881
01:18:50,796 --> 01:18:52,637
[SPEAKER_02]: So wait, you played them and passed them?

882
01:18:52,677 --> 01:18:53,657
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I passed them all.

883
01:18:54,420 --> 01:18:55,360
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you big stud.

884
01:18:58,081 --> 01:19:06,103
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you one of those folks on Bomani style that gets into those, you know, those pissing contests about, you know, I pass this, or yo, I pass this.

885
01:19:06,383 --> 01:19:10,604
[SPEAKER_30]: I pass this blindfolded with one hand, and I'm better than Lisu, and da-ba-da-ba-da.

886
01:19:11,905 --> 01:19:13,145
[SPEAKER_28]: No, I'm not one of those.

887
01:19:13,405 --> 01:19:14,045
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, good, good.

888
01:19:14,125 --> 01:19:17,966
[SPEAKER_28]: I just want to say... If you were, we'd have to shoot you.

889
01:19:20,532 --> 01:19:26,735
[SPEAKER_28]: But yeah, I just want to have my say about Drum Mania V. You want to say something about Drum Mania Guitar Freaks V?

890
01:19:27,456 --> 01:19:27,676
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah.

891
01:19:27,856 --> 01:19:28,376
[SPEAKER_02]: What's on your mind?

892
01:19:29,377 --> 01:19:33,999
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, yeah, there's some new stuff on Drum Mania V, as everybody's saying.

893
01:19:34,519 --> 01:19:40,202
[SPEAKER_28]: And yeah, they have the, like, sorting it out.

894
01:19:40,302 --> 01:19:44,264
[SPEAKER_28]: They have a folder 80D or something like that.

895
01:19:44,865 --> 01:19:45,665
[SPEAKER_28]: It's really interesting.

896
01:19:47,146 --> 01:19:50,507
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't seen the game myself yet, so I can't really comment, but okay.

897
01:19:52,528 --> 01:19:56,929
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope to play it someday, but I refuse to go to Roosevelt Golf Land to look at it, because that place is a dump.

898
01:19:57,309 --> 01:19:59,970
[SPEAKER_02]: But, someday.

899
01:20:01,991 --> 01:20:02,731
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything else on your mind?

900
01:20:03,411 --> 01:20:05,072
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's kind of it.

901
01:20:05,532 --> 01:20:06,512
[SPEAKER_02]: How's Nightstyle coming?

902
01:20:06,532 --> 01:20:08,713
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you cleared everything yet, or you still got some songs to go?

903
01:20:09,533 --> 01:20:11,794
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, I can do bad one-handed.

904
01:20:13,826 --> 01:20:14,826
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you doing?

905
01:20:15,407 --> 01:20:17,388
[SPEAKER_02]: But I haven't made any double A's yet.

906
01:20:17,888 --> 01:20:19,128
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, what do you do with the other hand?

907
01:20:20,209 --> 01:20:20,449
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

908
01:20:21,329 --> 01:20:23,010
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, because you play bag one-handed.

909
01:20:23,050 --> 01:20:24,090
[SPEAKER_02]: What does the other hand do?

910
01:20:25,011 --> 01:20:26,331
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, the scratch, of course.

911
01:20:26,751 --> 01:20:27,432
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

912
01:20:27,712 --> 01:20:28,292
[SPEAKER_02]: That's boring.

913
01:20:29,833 --> 01:20:30,593
[SPEAKER_02]: That's two hands.

914
01:20:30,613 --> 01:20:33,934
[SPEAKER_02]: LankyStyle's calling you out saying that that's two hands if you use one for scratching.

915
01:20:35,755 --> 01:20:37,356
[SPEAKER_28]: One hand is actually, you know, just bring the keys.

916
01:20:37,476 --> 01:20:38,096
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, two hands.

917
01:20:39,997 --> 01:20:42,698
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, a lot of people play... Well, like, I play with, like...

918
01:20:43,927 --> 01:20:50,070
[SPEAKER_02]: 6 fingers when I play usually because I just use my thumb to hit the first two keys and I use my hand for the rest of them.

919
01:20:50,350 --> 01:20:51,510
[SPEAKER_02]: So I play 6 finger.

920
01:20:51,590 --> 01:20:52,851
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that worth something?

921
01:20:53,771 --> 01:20:54,471
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, 6 finger.

922
01:20:55,472 --> 01:20:57,753
[SPEAKER_02]: Is 6 finger 2DX playing worth anything on the forums?

923
01:20:57,773 --> 01:21:01,034
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if I go post, I go, hey guys, I'm a 6 finger 2DX player.

924
01:21:01,254 --> 01:21:02,375
[SPEAKER_02]: Who wants to touch me?

925
01:21:02,675 --> 01:21:04,996
[SPEAKER_20]: I play 1 finger when I watch people pass those in others.

926
01:21:05,416 --> 01:21:06,056
[SPEAKER_20]: No, 1 finger.

927
01:21:06,076 --> 01:21:08,977
[SPEAKER_20]: Guess which finger that is.

928
01:21:10,218 --> 01:21:11,538
[SPEAKER_02]: Now what do you do with the other 9 fingers?

929
01:21:15,953 --> 01:21:21,877
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, the others are busy being held down while the one is gloriously extended in all of my fuck you glory.

930
01:21:22,657 --> 01:21:29,042
[SPEAKER_20]: And then the other one is usually, uh, usually, uh, I don't know, getting money.

931
01:21:29,062 --> 01:21:29,462
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know.

932
01:21:30,905 --> 01:21:31,486
[SPEAKER_02]: Getting a dollar.

933
01:21:31,786 --> 01:21:32,206
[SPEAKER_20]: Getting a dollar.

934
01:21:32,566 --> 01:21:32,907
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

935
01:21:33,007 --> 01:21:34,708
[SPEAKER_20]: Put a dollar in the token machine to play something else.

936
01:21:34,969 --> 01:21:36,069
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just messing with you, Siggy.

937
01:21:36,090 --> 01:21:37,651
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool that you... That's all right.

938
01:21:37,691 --> 01:21:38,151
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all right.

939
01:21:38,191 --> 01:21:39,172
[SPEAKER_20]: We're teasing, you know.

940
01:21:39,192 --> 01:21:40,673
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool that you're doing the one-handed thing.

941
01:21:41,474 --> 01:21:54,706
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's kind of a nice way to play it because, you know... It leaves your other hand free for things like Doritos and... Or when you play Keyboard Mania, you're going to want to be able to do as much of that kind of note thing with one hand as possible.

942
01:21:54,966 --> 01:21:55,947
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the one thing I always know.

943
01:21:55,987 --> 01:21:57,488
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you played much Keyboard Mania at all?

944
01:21:58,362 --> 01:22:01,324
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I have played Keyboard Mania twice back at MGL.

945
01:22:01,524 --> 01:22:01,684
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

946
01:22:01,964 --> 01:22:04,285
[SPEAKER_02]: And you really have to do the one hand.

947
01:22:04,685 --> 01:22:12,870
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're going to play on the expert levels, you have to be able to do things with one hand up here while you're doing a completely different note pattern down here, just like a normal piano playing, really.

948
01:22:13,310 --> 01:22:14,771
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's one thing I noticed.

949
01:22:14,811 --> 01:22:15,071
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

950
01:22:16,007 --> 01:22:21,268
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, the only problem I have with Keyboard Mania is you don't know which fingers to press.

951
01:22:21,728 --> 01:22:29,310
[SPEAKER_28]: They should have that, like which fingers to press, like three as in the middle finger or one for the thumb.

952
01:22:30,310 --> 01:22:33,111
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, like a guide as to, you know, what... Yeah, it's a guide.

953
01:22:33,971 --> 01:22:38,372
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you kind of have to know piano and they teach you that stuff in piano.

954
01:22:39,204 --> 01:22:41,226
[SPEAKER_02]: But that would be cool if Keyboard Mania would show that stuff.

955
01:22:41,426 --> 01:22:43,708
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, hey, what a great sales piece.

956
01:22:43,748 --> 01:22:47,711
[SPEAKER_02]: They could sell Keyboard Mania as a piano teaching device, which I guess they did.

957
01:22:48,432 --> 01:22:51,354
[SPEAKER_02]: It did get a limited release, but come on.

958
01:22:51,795 --> 01:22:53,997
[SPEAKER_02]: Who do you know that owns Keyboard Mania for a PC?

959
01:22:54,597 --> 01:22:55,418
[SPEAKER_02]: Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp.

960
01:22:55,438 --> 01:22:56,159
[SPEAKER_02]: No one, that's right.

961
01:22:58,521 --> 01:23:00,462
[SPEAKER_02]: They could mass market that if they wanted to.

962
01:23:00,662 --> 01:23:05,987
[SPEAKER_02]: They should just bring, I don't know, whatever.

963
01:23:07,774 --> 01:23:11,257
[SPEAKER_02]: They should have keyboard mania, like literally typing mania.

964
01:23:12,698 --> 01:23:13,659
[SPEAKER_02]: They have that in Japan.

965
01:23:14,480 --> 01:23:15,541
[SPEAKER_02]: The beat mania, da-da-da.

966
01:23:17,883 --> 01:23:19,565
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what I said when I played it, da-da-da.

967
01:23:19,745 --> 01:23:19,985
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

968
01:23:20,906 --> 01:23:23,089
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, we're going to let you go, Stiggy, but thanks so much for calling in.

969
01:23:23,129 --> 01:23:23,769
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a good one, okay?

970
01:23:24,270 --> 01:23:24,470
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

971
01:23:24,690 --> 01:23:25,251
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, later.

972
01:23:25,851 --> 01:23:26,071
[SPEAKER_02]: Later.

973
01:23:26,272 --> 01:23:26,952
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have an outro?

974
01:23:27,933 --> 01:23:28,133
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

975
01:23:28,534 --> 01:23:29,214
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, bye.

976
01:23:30,342 --> 01:23:30,642
[SPEAKER_02]: Later.

977
01:23:31,203 --> 01:23:35,326
[SPEAKER_02]: I figured since he had this big introduction that he might have something to say as he's leaving, but I guess not.

978
01:23:35,667 --> 01:23:37,048
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see what our next caller has to say.

979
01:23:37,088 --> 01:23:38,068
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

980
01:23:38,849 --> 01:23:40,050
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, SSJ100, Matt here.

981
01:23:40,170 --> 01:23:41,691
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, SSJ100, Matt here.

982
01:23:41,751 --> 01:23:42,272
[SPEAKER_02]: What's on your mind?

983
01:23:43,653 --> 01:23:43,973
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing.

984
01:23:43,993 --> 01:23:48,617
[SPEAKER_03]: I was ready to give my In the Groove review.

985
01:23:49,098 --> 01:23:49,538
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, goody.

986
01:23:49,698 --> 01:23:50,178
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's hear it.

987
01:23:50,959 --> 01:23:52,620
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, I actually got to try it.

988
01:23:52,660 --> 01:23:54,262
[SPEAKER_03]: It took me months to get it here, but...

989
01:23:56,527 --> 01:24:00,851
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, at first, when I first played it about three times, I hated it.

990
01:24:02,472 --> 01:24:07,876
[SPEAKER_03]: I hated the fact of bombs and other stuff, but I figured out you could take those off.

991
01:24:08,677 --> 01:24:11,419
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, actually, when you play it a bunch of times, it's not that bad.

992
01:24:12,440 --> 01:24:14,181
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you started to warm up to it a little bit?

993
01:24:14,241 --> 01:24:17,424
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, at first, you're like, this sucks, I hate it, but I can't stop playing it, right?

994
01:24:18,585 --> 01:24:18,785
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

995
01:24:19,534 --> 01:24:21,355
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of how I felt for a little bit.

996
01:24:21,656 --> 01:24:23,197
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I was okay with it when I first played.

997
01:24:23,437 --> 01:24:24,258
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just neutral.

998
01:24:24,578 --> 01:24:34,025
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, this isn't as great as all the people on the internet say it is, but it's not as bad as a lot of people on the internet say it is either, so I'm just going to stop paying attention to what I read on the internet.

999
01:24:34,806 --> 01:24:37,328
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1000
01:24:37,388 --> 01:24:40,630
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I just switch off between that and DDR.

1001
01:24:40,850 --> 01:24:43,472
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have both In The Groove and DDR at your local arcade?

1002
01:24:44,413 --> 01:24:44,613
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1003
01:24:44,794 --> 01:24:46,675
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you notice if one is more popular than the other?

1004
01:24:48,243 --> 01:24:49,945
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now, In the Groove is way more popular.

1005
01:24:50,205 --> 01:24:52,527
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I can get on the DDR all the time now.

1006
01:24:53,208 --> 01:25:15,187
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what's interesting is that that's kind of the first I've really heard of that, because a lot of arcades I've been to, even when I went and saw In the Groove in New Jersey, like last year when it was being beta tested or whatever, there were more people on DDR Extreme than In the Groove, and I thought that was kind of interesting, because I was like, dude, this is like one of two places in the nation where you can actually play this game, and there's still more people playing DDR.

1007
01:25:16,580 --> 01:25:21,420
[SPEAKER_02]: And even when I go to the local bowling alley that has more games, I see more kids on DDR

1008
01:25:22,862 --> 01:25:31,646
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the reason for that is that in the groove, despite the fact that it's a technically good game and it's got good music and stuff, it's just ugly.

1009
01:25:32,186 --> 01:25:33,667
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a really ugly game.

1010
01:25:34,707 --> 01:25:38,129
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry to the folks that designed the graphics, but it's kind of ugly.

1011
01:25:38,189 --> 01:25:42,411
[SPEAKER_02]: DDR has that warm, saccharine, happy, crack vibe, right?

1012
01:25:42,731 --> 01:25:47,373
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas in the groove it has that, I'm industrial and I don't want anything to do with you vibe.

1013
01:25:47,413 --> 01:25:48,353
[SPEAKER_20]: I think maybe that's it.

1014
01:25:48,393 --> 01:25:49,534
[SPEAKER_20]: It's too Americanized.

1015
01:25:50,914 --> 01:25:51,275
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.

1016
01:25:51,955 --> 01:25:52,235
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1017
01:25:53,666 --> 01:25:54,026
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1018
01:25:54,366 --> 01:25:55,967
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why I think more people are his own.

1019
01:25:56,327 --> 01:25:56,987
[SPEAKER_02]: So what would you say?

1020
01:25:57,027 --> 01:25:59,848
[SPEAKER_02]: If he gave In the Groove a score on a scale of 1 to 5, what would you say?

1021
01:26:00,408 --> 01:26:04,789
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, when I first played it, I gave it about a 6, and now it's kind of like an 8 or so.

1022
01:26:05,050 --> 01:26:05,770
[SPEAKER_03]: On a scale of 1 to 5?

1023
01:26:06,230 --> 01:26:06,810
[SPEAKER_03]: That's incredible.

1024
01:26:06,830 --> 01:26:07,410
[SPEAKER_03]: 1 to 5?

1025
01:26:07,550 --> 01:26:09,191
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought you said 1 to 10.

1026
01:26:09,271 --> 01:26:09,431
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, 1 to 10.

1027
01:26:09,731 --> 01:26:10,551
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's fine.

1028
01:26:11,832 --> 01:26:14,432
[SPEAKER_03]: Doesn't matter, but... All right.

1029
01:26:14,592 --> 01:26:15,113
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, what else?

1030
01:26:15,433 --> 01:26:16,473
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else you wanted to share with us?

1031
01:26:18,230 --> 01:26:21,776
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, not really, just congratulations on the new, uh, place.

1032
01:26:22,196 --> 01:26:23,178
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, we appreciate it.

1033
01:26:23,198 --> 01:26:26,683
[SPEAKER_02]: We hope we can get all our sound working and everything, although I think, I think everything's cool now.

1034
01:26:27,965 --> 01:26:28,726
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, yep.

1035
01:26:29,367 --> 01:26:29,667
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1036
01:26:30,128 --> 01:26:31,970
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thanks, have a good one, thanks for calling in.

1037
01:26:32,852 --> 01:26:33,132
[SPEAKER_02]: Later.

1038
01:26:35,302 --> 01:26:36,583
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always nice to hear from folks.

1039
01:26:36,643 --> 01:26:41,545
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, what we're going to do, we're going to go into the Orange Lounge cage match right now.

1040
01:26:41,605 --> 01:26:44,206
[SPEAKER_02]: If you didn't get through, try back again later.

1041
01:26:44,226 --> 01:26:45,807
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of you guys just keep hammering us.

1042
01:26:45,847 --> 01:26:47,827
[SPEAKER_02]: You just call again and again and again until you get through.

1043
01:26:49,068 --> 01:26:51,749
[SPEAKER_02]: You can stop doing that because we're not taking any more calls until the cage match is over.

1044
01:26:53,410 --> 01:26:56,031
[SPEAKER_02]: But thanks for trying, and we'll get to you guys later.

1045
01:26:56,051 --> 01:26:59,372
[SPEAKER_02]: I know a lot of you guys have some things to say, and we'll get into some more of the money news a little later.

1046
01:26:59,392 --> 01:27:02,794
[SPEAKER_02]: But we've got some business to settle, such as tonight's cage match.

1047
01:27:06,462 --> 01:27:07,823
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have a Cage Match song tonight, Loki?

1048
01:27:08,063 --> 01:27:08,363
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, goody.

1049
01:27:08,823 --> 01:27:09,003
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.

1050
01:27:09,023 --> 01:27:11,124
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's see.

1051
01:27:11,164 --> 01:27:12,125
[SPEAKER_02]: We're starting fresh.

1052
01:27:12,845 --> 01:27:16,647
[SPEAKER_02]: So, as a reminder, the way the Cage Match works, we play three songs for you guys.

1053
01:27:17,027 --> 01:27:25,491
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys vote on your favorite song, and the winning song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's Bomani Music & More program.

1054
01:27:25,871 --> 01:27:27,332
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so we're starting fresh.

1055
01:27:27,692 --> 01:27:28,913
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no old songs.

1056
01:27:28,953 --> 01:27:31,694
[SPEAKER_02]: We're doing three brand new songs this week.

1057
01:27:32,054 --> 01:27:33,475
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess we'll start with my song.

1058
01:27:34,946 --> 01:27:35,947
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll do my song first tonight.

1059
01:27:35,967 --> 01:27:38,569
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're going to hear them all in their entirety.

1060
01:27:38,609 --> 01:27:46,194
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember, the only way you can vote is to actually be in our chat room over at www.orangeloungeradio.com.

1061
01:27:47,155 --> 01:27:56,942
[SPEAKER_02]: The song I decided to put in tonight's cage match, when I first heard this song, I was like, this song kind of reminds me of Erotic, but without so much cheese.

1062
01:27:57,763 --> 01:27:58,924
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I don't know, it's not so...

1063
01:28:01,061 --> 01:28:02,242
[SPEAKER_02]: In the name of, in the name of love

1064
01:29:24,295 --> 01:29:28,160
In the name of love In the name of, in the name of love

1065
01:30:06,533 --> 01:30:07,774
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for watching!

1066
01:30:35,861 --> 01:30:36,617
Thanks for watching!

1067
01:31:59,234 --> 01:32:01,395
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, that was song number one in tonight's cage match.

1068
01:32:01,415 --> 01:32:04,056
[SPEAKER_02]: That was Jet Set in the name of love.

1069
01:32:04,236 --> 01:32:05,757
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go around and see what we think.

1070
01:32:05,797 --> 01:32:07,378
[SPEAKER_02]: But remember, it's not our vote that counts.

1071
01:32:07,418 --> 01:32:07,898
[SPEAKER_02]: It's yours.

1072
01:32:07,998 --> 01:32:09,219
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to be in the chat room to play.

1073
01:32:09,379 --> 01:32:10,599
[SPEAKER_02]: www.orangehunter.com.

1074
01:32:11,019 --> 01:32:11,600
[SPEAKER_02]: Click on chat.

1075
01:32:11,640 --> 01:32:11,920
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie.

1076
01:32:12,600 --> 01:32:13,100
[SPEAKER_20]: It gets a one.

1077
01:32:13,701 --> 01:32:15,581
[SPEAKER_20]: It has no originality to it.

1078
01:32:15,721 --> 01:32:16,522
[SPEAKER_20]: Nothing innovative.

1079
01:32:17,282 --> 01:32:19,123
[SPEAKER_20]: It sounds like the same rehash.

1080
01:32:20,023 --> 01:32:20,423
[SPEAKER_20]: No offense.

1081
01:32:20,463 --> 01:32:21,344
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, it was perky.

1082
01:32:22,144 --> 01:32:25,186
[SPEAKER_20]: And if I wanted to make myself really happy, I guess I'd listen to it again.

1083
01:32:25,726 --> 01:32:28,327
[SPEAKER_20]: But there was no innovation to it.

1084
01:32:29,039 --> 01:32:29,640
[SPEAKER_20]: Nothing new.

1085
01:32:30,800 --> 01:32:31,881
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, I'll be nice to three.

1086
01:32:32,842 --> 01:32:33,682
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, Loki.

1087
01:32:34,243 --> 01:32:38,526
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'll be nice because I don't like Aqua or anything that tries to beat Aqua.

1088
01:32:39,226 --> 01:32:55,238
[SPEAKER_02]: I honestly don't like the whole happy, you know, you got one guy that sings really deep and then the girl's like... But it reminded me of sort of like the woman's voice is out of place and the guy sounds like a member of, you know...

1089
01:32:56,249 --> 01:33:05,035
[SPEAKER_02]: The Bloodhound Gang, so I just, I didn't really know, it didn't really feel right to me, but because it's trying to be happy, and I'm not happy, it gets a 2.

1090
01:33:06,355 --> 01:33:22,025
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, my thoughts, I think that that song is, you know, it's like you take the Ironic and Aqua songs, which are like so happy to the point of nauseousness, and I think that song kind of strips a lot of that fakeness off, so I think you guys are

1091
01:33:22,398 --> 01:33:25,779
[SPEAKER_02]: Just kind of closing yourself off to it, because it is a little bit formulaic, but whatever.

1092
01:33:26,779 --> 01:33:31,060
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's decent, so I give it a 9, because it puts me in a good mood, makes me happy.

1093
01:33:31,560 --> 01:33:31,801
[SPEAKER_30]: Angel?

1094
01:33:36,502 --> 01:33:37,082
[SPEAKER_19]: Uh, 4.

1095
01:33:38,182 --> 01:33:38,782
[SPEAKER_30]: Any reason why?

1096
01:33:40,023 --> 01:33:43,164
[SPEAKER_19]: It's kind of, like, awkward, but it's missing something.

1097
01:33:43,764 --> 01:33:44,284
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright.

1098
01:33:44,824 --> 01:33:45,364
[SPEAKER_30]: Arcadian42?

1099
01:33:45,464 --> 01:33:46,885
[SPEAKER_30]: It's heavy.

1100
01:33:47,045 --> 01:33:47,645
[SPEAKER_26]: It was bouncy.

1101
01:33:47,805 --> 01:33:48,405
[SPEAKER_26]: It was generic.

1102
01:33:48,425 --> 01:33:48,405
5.

1103
01:33:48,825 --> 01:33:50,026
[SPEAKER_30]: Alright.

1104
01:33:50,866 --> 01:33:51,686
[SPEAKER_02]: And, LankyStyle?

1105
01:33:53,638 --> 01:33:53,919
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1106
01:33:54,599 --> 01:33:55,499
[SPEAKER_02]: What did you think of that song?

1107
01:33:55,519 --> 01:33:56,180
[SPEAKER_02]: What are we doing here?

1108
01:33:56,940 --> 01:33:57,360
[SPEAKER_02]: Forget it.

1109
01:33:57,801 --> 01:33:58,161
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

1110
01:33:59,282 --> 01:33:59,942
[SPEAKER_20]: Just rank the song.

1111
01:33:59,962 --> 01:34:00,342
[SPEAKER_20]: What do you think?

1112
01:34:00,422 --> 01:34:00,842
[SPEAKER_20]: One to ten.

1113
01:34:03,784 --> 01:34:04,084
[SPEAKER_30]: Six.

1114
01:34:06,085 --> 01:34:06,486
[SPEAKER_30]: Alright.

1115
01:34:07,666 --> 01:34:08,647
[SPEAKER_30]: Let's move on.

1116
01:34:08,727 --> 01:34:10,268
[SPEAKER_30]: Song number two is Jamie's Pick.

1117
01:34:10,308 --> 01:34:11,769
[SPEAKER_30]: What did you pick for us tonight, Jamie?

1118
01:34:12,649 --> 01:34:15,331
[SPEAKER_20]: I've been wanting to put this in like a month ago, but I kept winning.

1119
01:34:16,331 --> 01:34:17,832
[SPEAKER_20]: It's Gorillaz, Feel Good Inc.

1120
01:34:18,092 --> 01:34:19,613
[SPEAKER_20]: I know it's been playing on the radio, but...

1121
01:34:20,515 --> 01:34:23,397
[SPEAKER_20]: I really, really like this song a whole bunch.

1122
01:34:23,657 --> 01:34:26,518
[SPEAKER_20]: I really like everything they've been doing with music.

1123
01:34:26,558 --> 01:34:27,399
[SPEAKER_20]: It's been innovative.

1124
01:34:27,439 --> 01:34:27,959
[SPEAKER_20]: It's been new.

1125
01:34:27,979 --> 01:34:31,461
[SPEAKER_20]: It's been taking the whole pop genre in a different direction.

1126
01:34:32,481 --> 01:34:34,603
[SPEAKER_20]: And this one just has a really sexy bass line, too.

1127
01:34:34,723 --> 01:34:36,043
[SPEAKER_20]: So I want that this ends.

1128
01:34:37,464 --> 01:34:37,764
[SPEAKER_30]: All right.

1129
01:34:38,164 --> 01:34:38,485
[SPEAKER_30]: Here it is.

1130
01:34:38,525 --> 01:34:40,666
[SPEAKER_30]: Song number two, Gorillaz, Feel Good Inc.

1131
01:34:40,906 --> 01:34:41,126
[SPEAKER_30]: Enjoy.

1132
01:35:48,950 --> 01:35:50,933
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks for watching!

1133
01:36:42,253 --> 01:36:42,933
S, Actdeft,

1134
01:37:11,420 --> 01:37:12,882
Thank you for watching!

1135
01:38:26,109 --> 01:38:29,351
[SPEAKER_02]: Song number two there, Gorillaz with Feel Good Inc.

1136
01:38:29,671 --> 01:38:30,651
[SPEAKER_02]: How'd you guys feel?

1137
01:38:30,671 --> 01:38:32,953
[SPEAKER_02]: Did that make you feel good or make you feel sick?

1138
01:38:33,053 --> 01:38:34,133
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, DarkSakura.

1139
01:38:34,534 --> 01:38:37,155
[SPEAKER_20]: I've been listening to this song for two months and haven't gotten sick of it yet.

1140
01:38:37,735 --> 01:38:39,816
[SPEAKER_20]: So, uh, it gets a ten automatically.

1141
01:38:39,856 --> 01:38:41,737
[SPEAKER_20]: The whole album gets a fifty million.

1142
01:38:41,838 --> 01:38:42,478
[SPEAKER_20]: So, yeah.

1143
01:38:43,018 --> 01:38:44,139
[SPEAKER_20]: Buy Demon Days when it comes out.

1144
01:38:45,239 --> 01:38:45,540
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki.

1145
01:38:51,283 --> 01:38:51,983
[SPEAKER_02]: I had no mic.

1146
01:38:53,164 --> 01:38:55,005
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, no, it has a good bass line.

1147
01:38:55,465 --> 01:38:55,505
[SPEAKER_02]: Um,

1148
01:38:56,425 --> 01:38:58,826
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, it's just, it's okay.

1149
01:38:59,487 --> 01:39:00,407
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I like Gorillaz.

1150
01:39:01,087 --> 01:39:02,128
[SPEAKER_02]: I love their older stuff.

1151
01:39:02,968 --> 01:39:07,350
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, there's parts of the song I didn't like, and other parts are okay.

1152
01:39:07,530 --> 01:39:12,633
[SPEAKER_02]: So it just gets like a 7 or 8-ish, you know, 8 I guess.

1153
01:39:14,714 --> 01:39:18,037
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, that song is kind of like a big cake to me.

1154
01:39:18,457 --> 01:39:20,698
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you've got frost, like it's a multi-layered cake.

1155
01:39:20,719 --> 01:39:26,042
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got this really like nice frosting, and then there's like really sweet stuff in the middle, like the fruit stuff in the middle.

1156
01:39:26,062 --> 01:39:27,083
[SPEAKER_02]: What kind of frosting are we talking about?

1157
01:39:27,323 --> 01:39:29,124
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, strawberry frosting.

1158
01:39:29,345 --> 01:39:29,485
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh!

1159
01:39:30,205 --> 01:39:30,866
[SPEAKER_30]: Oh, oh.

1160
01:39:31,266 --> 01:39:32,727
[SPEAKER_30]: You had me going with frosting.

1161
01:39:32,747 --> 01:39:33,147
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, okay.

1162
01:39:33,187 --> 01:39:33,808
[SPEAKER_30]: Cream cheese.

1163
01:39:34,008 --> 01:39:35,149
[SPEAKER_02]: How about chocolate frosting?

1164
01:39:35,709 --> 01:39:36,329
[SPEAKER_02]: Chocolate frosting?

1165
01:39:36,390 --> 01:39:37,370
[SPEAKER_02]: How did I get that point?

1166
01:39:37,510 --> 01:39:40,072
[SPEAKER_02]: And then like in the middle is like, I don't know, like extra chocolate.

1167
01:39:40,092 --> 01:39:40,332
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1168
01:39:40,352 --> 01:39:41,052
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really sweet.

1169
01:39:41,092 --> 01:39:44,714
[SPEAKER_02]: My point is, it's really sweet, like, but the rest of it's kind of cake.

1170
01:39:44,754 --> 01:39:45,275
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just cake.

1171
01:39:45,735 --> 01:39:51,438
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like, because that song is kind of like three things combined, it feels like to me, like there's different elements of it.

1172
01:39:51,518 --> 01:39:56,541
[SPEAKER_02]: Or it's like you got a good cake and then they throw in that stupid custard filling and it's like, oh, goddamn!

1173
01:39:56,881 --> 01:39:57,421
[SPEAKER_02]: That's more like it.

1174
01:39:57,441 --> 01:39:58,582
[SPEAKER_02]: Why did you ruin a good cake?

1175
01:39:58,622 --> 01:40:06,624
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of like it, because like there's two elements to that song I really, like especially one, like the slow parts of the song, I really, really, really like.

1176
01:40:06,644 --> 01:40:07,845
[SPEAKER_20]: The slow parts are very blur.

1177
01:40:08,465 --> 01:40:10,005
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, see I like blur, I think that's why.

1178
01:40:10,246 --> 01:40:12,726
[SPEAKER_02]: But then like the De La Soul stuff, that's like the custard.

1179
01:40:12,926 --> 01:40:13,947
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not, I'm not dead on it.

1180
01:40:13,967 --> 01:40:15,427
[SPEAKER_02]: See, that's what, I like the opposite.

1181
01:40:15,547 --> 01:40:19,149
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the De La Soul stuff, but I hated the slow parts.

1182
01:40:19,409 --> 01:40:21,009
[SPEAKER_30]: Well, then I feel the opposite.

1183
01:40:21,229 --> 01:40:22,670
[SPEAKER_30]: But the score is still the same, I give it an 8.

1184
01:40:23,070 --> 01:40:23,270
[SPEAKER_30]: Angel.

1185
01:40:24,861 --> 01:40:28,984
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, I look good as well, so I will give it an 8.

1186
01:40:29,824 --> 01:40:30,284
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

1187
01:40:30,324 --> 01:40:34,607
[SPEAKER_19]: Not just because I'm copying you, but not really because I'm copying you, but... Just because you're copying us.

1188
01:40:34,647 --> 01:40:35,047
[SPEAKER_19]: Arcadian.

1189
01:40:35,147 --> 01:40:35,507
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

1190
01:40:37,529 --> 01:40:39,250
[SPEAKER_25]: I like Boston Cream Pie.

1191
01:40:39,630 --> 01:40:39,810
[SPEAKER_25]: Good.

1192
01:40:40,791 --> 01:40:41,231
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah!

1193
01:40:41,451 --> 01:40:43,412
[SPEAKER_20]: Boston Cream Pie is cake with custard.

1194
01:40:43,893 --> 01:40:44,653
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, so it's good.

1195
01:40:45,193 --> 01:40:46,334
[SPEAKER_25]: And Y'all Can Realize Rock 2.

1196
01:40:46,874 --> 01:40:46,334
9.

1197
01:40:48,095 --> 01:40:49,996
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, uh, LankyStyle.

1198
01:40:50,837 --> 01:40:50,917
[SPEAKER_29]: Um...

1199
01:40:52,345 --> 01:40:56,929
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't think it makes me feel good, it makes me feel pretty ink, you know, incorporated.

1200
01:40:58,190 --> 01:41:04,155
[SPEAKER_29]: No, you know what, I hate gorillas, like, they're always the source of any problem in like a sci-fi story.

1201
01:41:05,015 --> 01:41:06,416
[SPEAKER_29]: Gorillas are monkeys too, right?

1202
01:41:06,636 --> 01:41:11,440
[SPEAKER_20]: No, those are, you're thinking of monkeys are not gorillas.

1203
01:41:12,701 --> 01:41:13,962
[SPEAKER_29]: They're apes, they're simians, right?

1204
01:41:13,982 --> 01:41:15,143
[SPEAKER_20]: The monkeys had Mickey Dolenz!

1205
01:41:17,005 --> 01:41:18,306
[SPEAKER_20]: And Davy Jones.

1206
01:41:18,366 --> 01:41:19,206
[SPEAKER_29]: Exactly, Bradley.

1207
01:41:19,487 --> 01:41:21,028
[SPEAKER_30]: However, Congo was a bad movie.

1208
01:41:22,586 --> 01:41:25,407
[SPEAKER_30]: Gorillas learn sign language and talk to us.

1209
01:41:25,427 --> 01:41:27,707
[SPEAKER_29]: Gorillas are smart, except for QD.

1210
01:41:27,847 --> 01:41:29,868
[SPEAKER_29]: And apparently they can sing through a megaphone.

1211
01:41:31,988 --> 01:41:38,090
[SPEAKER_02]: And they also, you know, take women and run up the Empire Stability.

1212
01:41:38,210 --> 01:41:39,871
[SPEAKER_02]: They run them up the Empire Stability.

1213
01:41:39,891 --> 01:41:43,792
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, that is... Will you please give the song a rating so we can finish this goddamn segment?

1214
01:41:43,812 --> 01:41:45,272
[SPEAKER_29]: Okay, hold on, a little back...

1215
01:41:46,142 --> 01:41:50,384
[SPEAKER_29]: I think this is the only good song on the new album.

1216
01:41:50,485 --> 01:41:52,866
[SPEAKER_29]: I've listened to the whole thing and I'm not impressed.

1217
01:41:52,906 --> 01:41:56,068
[SPEAKER_29]: The last album was much better in my opinion.

1218
01:41:56,688 --> 01:41:57,769
[SPEAKER_29]: But it's still a good song.

1219
01:41:57,789 --> 01:41:59,469
[SPEAKER_29]: Like I said, it's the best song on the album.

1220
01:41:59,710 --> 01:42:01,170
[SPEAKER_29]: So it gets, for me, an 8.

1221
01:42:02,351 --> 01:42:03,792
[SPEAKER_29]: But it's going to get old for me really quick.

1222
01:42:03,812 --> 01:42:06,353
[SPEAKER_29]: I've already listened to it like four times and I'm still kind of like, hmm.

1223
01:42:06,893 --> 01:42:09,515
[SPEAKER_29]: I did like the slow parts better than the rest of it.

1224
01:42:09,615 --> 01:42:10,155
[SPEAKER_29]: I prefer blur.

1225
01:42:12,695 --> 01:42:15,258
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's get into the last song of tonight's cage match.

1226
01:42:15,438 --> 01:42:16,239
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, what'd you pick?

1227
01:42:17,840 --> 01:42:20,082
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I hope this is what's on this track here.

1228
01:42:25,207 --> 01:42:31,894
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, hopefully this is, oh my god, I'm saying hopefully, a Paul Terry track.

1229
01:42:31,994 --> 01:42:37,559
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully this is the song from the Midnight Tune 2 soundtrack.

1230
01:42:39,764 --> 01:42:41,225
[SPEAKER_29]: Wangan Midnight Maximum 2 and 2.

1231
01:42:41,685 --> 01:42:42,326
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that song.

1232
01:42:42,626 --> 01:42:43,747
[SPEAKER_02]: Or that CD.

1233
01:42:43,887 --> 01:42:45,308
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, it's an awesome game.

1234
01:42:45,388 --> 01:42:49,631
[SPEAKER_02]: It's sort of an Initial D-ish type thing.

1235
01:42:49,731 --> 01:42:51,112
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got pretty cool music in it.

1236
01:42:51,452 --> 01:42:52,733
[SPEAKER_02]: But then there's Paul Terry.

1237
01:42:53,233 --> 01:42:56,636
[SPEAKER_02]: And Paul Terry, honestly, I hate Paul Terry.

1238
01:42:56,776 --> 01:42:57,176
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate her.

1239
01:42:57,216 --> 01:43:00,959
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think it's the Paul Terry-Nyoki combo that I hate.

1240
01:43:01,199 --> 01:43:03,040
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Paul Terry-Nyoki that is bad.

1241
01:43:03,060 --> 01:43:06,182
[SPEAKER_02]: Paul Terry, other artists, that's okay.

1242
01:43:06,383 --> 01:43:08,244
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a song that she sings in.

1243
01:43:09,784 --> 01:43:11,585
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I don't remember the original artist.

1244
01:43:12,806 --> 01:43:14,908
[SPEAKER_30]: It's Yuzo Koshiro, featuring Politary.

1245
01:43:14,928 --> 01:43:21,552
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, anyway, the guy that did music for Actraiser, and so this is the song, Nothing Can Live Forever.

1246
01:43:22,072 --> 01:43:26,134
[SPEAKER_02]: Yuzo Koshiro, featuring Politary, Nothing Can Live Forever, song number three.

1247
01:43:26,154 --> 01:43:27,755
[SPEAKER_02]: I am crossing my fingers, I hope this is the right studio.

1248
01:43:27,775 --> 01:43:28,456
[SPEAKER_02]: Enjoy, me too.

1249
01:43:34,259 --> 01:43:35,700
The time has come to say

1250
01:43:49,462 --> 01:43:50,923
Thank you for watching

1251
01:44:20,496 --> 01:44:21,897
I'm approaching my truth.

1252
01:46:35,270 --> 01:46:37,174
Thanks for watching!

1253
01:47:07,333 --> 01:47:14,237
Thanks for watching!

1254
01:48:02,130 --> 01:48:03,084
Thanks for watching!

1255
01:49:13,484 --> 01:49:15,786
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, that was song number three in tonight's cage match.

1256
01:49:15,846 --> 01:49:21,970
[SPEAKER_02]: That was Yuzo Koshiro featuring Paula Terry with Nothing Can Live Forever.

1257
01:49:22,010 --> 01:49:25,652
[SPEAKER_02]: Will that song live forever in your memory or is it going to die right now?

1258
01:49:25,732 --> 01:49:26,072
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie?

1259
01:49:29,054 --> 01:49:31,696
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't like Paula Terry because she can't hold a key to save her life.

1260
01:49:33,337 --> 01:49:34,318
[SPEAKER_20]: It was still pretty good.

1261
01:49:34,358 --> 01:49:36,179
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, it's too trance for my taste.

1262
01:49:37,220 --> 01:49:39,982
[SPEAKER_20]: But overall, it presented...

1263
01:49:41,164 --> 01:49:44,045
[SPEAKER_20]: It presented an image, that's all I can say.

1264
01:49:44,085 --> 01:49:52,049
[SPEAKER_20]: I like music that presents a picture, and that one I definitely got a feeling from, so it gets an 8 from me.

1265
01:49:53,650 --> 01:50:04,515
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the song, I like the beginning part with her sort of singing over it, because it's kind of like, you know, it kind of builds you up for it, but then the song kind of is like...

1266
01:50:04,949 --> 01:50:06,109
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, it's an okay song.

1267
01:50:06,269 --> 01:50:11,171
[SPEAKER_02]: It's what I had because I haven't cut down certain other songs that I need to be submitting to the cage match.

1268
01:50:11,711 --> 01:50:13,612
[SPEAKER_02]: But, uh, so it gets an 8.

1269
01:50:13,652 --> 01:50:18,553
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the best I'm gonna give it because... But, you gotta check out the whole soundtrack, it's really cool.

1270
01:50:20,514 --> 01:50:23,775
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I like the first minute, and then the other four I fell asleep.

1271
01:50:24,335 --> 01:50:24,595
[SPEAKER_02]: I give it a 6.

1272
01:50:25,575 --> 01:50:25,855
[SPEAKER_02]: Angel.

1273
01:50:28,116 --> 01:50:31,437
[SPEAKER_19]: It was pretty cool, um, I'll be nice and give it a 7.

1274
01:50:32,077 --> 01:50:33,918
[SPEAKER_19]: Because I don't know what else to give it, whatever.

1275
01:50:35,350 --> 01:50:35,930
[SPEAKER_02]: Arcadian.

1276
01:50:37,491 --> 01:50:38,091
[SPEAKER_27]: It was alright.

1277
01:50:39,231 --> 01:50:40,352
[SPEAKER_27]: I wasn't all that impressed.

1278
01:50:40,392 --> 01:50:42,232
[SPEAKER_27]: I haven't listened to the soundtrack yet.

1279
01:50:42,672 --> 01:50:43,593
[SPEAKER_27]: But I'll give it a 6.

1280
01:50:44,433 --> 01:50:45,093
[SPEAKER_02]: Lanky Style.

1281
01:50:46,053 --> 01:50:51,335
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm one of the weird people who believes that Paul Terry can only do good when she's coupled with a Balani artist.

1282
01:50:51,695 --> 01:50:56,017
[SPEAKER_29]: So, I'm not hugely a big fan of this song.

1283
01:50:56,237 --> 01:50:59,098
[SPEAKER_29]: The rest, pretty much the rest of that soundtrack is awesome.

1284
01:50:59,138 --> 01:51:01,098
[SPEAKER_29]: Just one kind of video of the team.

1285
01:51:01,118 --> 01:51:02,339
[SPEAKER_29]: So, I'm going with that.

1286
01:51:02,359 --> 01:51:02,499
[SPEAKER_29]: Just

1287
01:51:04,764 --> 01:51:05,884
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's recap.

1288
01:51:05,944 --> 01:51:08,405
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about time to vote, but first let's recap.

1289
01:51:08,485 --> 01:51:12,606
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember, you're going to send a private message to Sky with your vote, but here are the songs you can vote for tonight.

1290
01:51:12,666 --> 01:51:16,087
[SPEAKER_02]: Song number one is Jet Set, In the Name of Love.

1291
01:51:19,908 --> 01:51:27,770
[SPEAKER_13]: And song number two you can vote for tonight is Gorillaz with Feel Good Inc.

1292
01:51:28,671 --> 01:51:29,951
[SPEAKER_04]: It's my chocolate attack.

1293
01:51:37,573 --> 01:51:41,595
[SPEAKER_02]: And song number three you can vote for tonight is Yozo Koshiro.

1294
01:51:42,435 --> 01:51:43,616
[SPEAKER_02]: Did I get that right this time?

1295
01:51:43,976 --> 01:51:44,636
[SPEAKER_26]: It's close enough.

1296
01:51:44,856 --> 01:51:45,376
[SPEAKER_02]: Close enough.

1297
01:51:45,677 --> 01:51:46,697
[SPEAKER_02]: Featuring Paul and Terry.

1298
01:51:46,757 --> 01:51:47,517
[SPEAKER_02]: I did that from memory.

1299
01:51:48,137 --> 01:51:49,098
[SPEAKER_02]: Yozo Koshiro.

1300
01:51:49,118 --> 01:51:49,378
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

1301
01:51:49,818 --> 01:51:51,879
[SPEAKER_02]: Featuring Paul and Terry with Nothing Can Live Forever.

1302
01:52:04,560 --> 01:52:06,862
[SPEAKER_02]: Place vote now.

1303
01:52:07,002 --> 01:52:09,883
[SPEAKER_02]: Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.

1304
01:52:09,903 --> 01:52:12,645
[SPEAKER_02]: Song number one, song number two, song number three.

1305
01:52:12,665 --> 01:52:14,266
[SPEAKER_29]: Wait, and a surprise fourth song.

1306
01:52:15,067 --> 01:52:16,107
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1307
01:52:16,728 --> 01:52:17,588
[SPEAKER_29]: Sky the game.

1308
01:52:17,688 --> 01:52:18,709
[SPEAKER_02]: No twist here, sorry.

1309
01:52:19,309 --> 01:52:24,052
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, this is the part of the show where I would always ask, Loki, what's going on in the sim scene?

1310
01:52:24,153 --> 01:52:27,615
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you've been keeping tabs on what's going on, but what's up, Loki?

1311
01:52:30,430 --> 01:52:31,191
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a much.

1312
01:52:32,592 --> 01:52:34,853
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, really nothing going on.

1313
01:52:35,654 --> 01:52:38,816
[SPEAKER_02]: There's only a couple things I'd like to mention.

1314
01:52:40,217 --> 01:52:47,182
[SPEAKER_02]: First off, as far as simpacks being released, not really too much this week.

1315
01:52:47,943 --> 01:52:55,588
[SPEAKER_02]: However, there's this wonderful site that someone created because, I don't know if you remember, DDRAmerica.com, the old Belmonte Torrent site...

1316
01:52:57,216 --> 01:52:57,797
[SPEAKER_02]: Alt-Control-Delete.com

1317
01:53:16,393 --> 01:53:24,359
[SPEAKER_02]: BitTorrentTracker, and you've got some of the poppin' music soundtracks, and some 2DX.

1318
01:53:24,639 --> 01:53:26,180
[SPEAKER_02]: It's mainly soundtrack rips right now.

1319
01:53:27,401 --> 01:53:30,063
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I guess that's something worth mentioning.

1320
01:53:31,564 --> 01:53:33,706
[SPEAKER_02]: Chatroom is yelling, BMS contest.

1321
01:53:34,106 --> 01:53:37,649
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess this is something I think... Oh, yeah, but my cell's BMS contest.

1322
01:53:37,669 --> 01:53:38,789
[SPEAKER_02]: They have that going on right now.

1323
01:53:40,991 --> 01:53:41,852
[SPEAKER_02]: You sound excited.

1324
01:53:43,004 --> 01:53:44,144
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, come on now, folks.

1325
01:53:44,204 --> 01:53:48,406
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, really, I guess it could be cool.

1326
01:53:49,026 --> 01:54:00,651
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, but I just, you know, with the Japanese doing BMS files, I don't think USF is just going to be up to par with it.

1327
01:54:00,731 --> 01:54:04,092
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, the Japanese have, like, got you beat by a lot.

1328
01:54:05,758 --> 01:54:07,019
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my opinion on this stuff.

1329
01:54:07,059 --> 01:54:15,649
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you play Japanese BMS files and you're like, holy crap, this stuff could have been in Beatmania or in 2DX or something.

1330
01:54:15,689 --> 01:54:17,471
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just really high quality stuff.

1331
01:54:17,762 --> 01:54:22,203
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, also there's more of a team mentality from what I understand.

1332
01:54:22,483 --> 01:54:24,384
[SPEAKER_20]: It's set up like a professional production crew.

1333
01:54:24,464 --> 01:54:33,267
[SPEAKER_20]: I bet if more of the American producers of the BMS files got together and put the same kind of effort into it, they could come up with a quality product.

1334
01:54:33,287 --> 01:54:33,947
[SPEAKER_20]: It's like a food mix.

1335
01:54:34,127 --> 01:54:37,208
[SPEAKER_02]: A food mix is a perfect example of production quality.

1336
01:54:37,648 --> 01:54:39,328
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's just top-notch stuff right there.

1337
01:54:39,548 --> 01:54:45,110
[SPEAKER_02]: You could honestly, if they had the permission, you could release a DDR mix of all food mix stuff, and it would...

1338
01:54:46,161 --> 01:54:47,722
[SPEAKER_02]: You wouldn't have to really change anything to it.

1339
01:54:47,842 --> 01:54:48,862
[SPEAKER_02]: It would look great.

1340
01:54:49,683 --> 01:54:55,525
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what's really cool about... And BMS stuff is exactly the same.

1341
01:54:55,585 --> 01:54:57,566
[SPEAKER_02]: They do all their remixing stuff on there.

1342
01:54:58,026 --> 01:55:02,288
[SPEAKER_02]: The production quality is incredibly awesome.

1343
01:55:02,448 --> 01:55:12,212
[SPEAKER_02]: And even with stuff they only have movie files playing in the background, it's all just stop motion with bitmaps and JPEGs and stuff.

1344
01:55:12,392 --> 01:55:13,713
[SPEAKER_02]: And it still looks incredible.

1345
01:55:13,893 --> 01:55:14,193
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just...

1346
01:55:15,296 --> 01:55:16,337
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know how to describe it.

1347
01:55:16,397 --> 01:55:16,877
[SPEAKER_02]: It's awesome.

1348
01:55:16,917 --> 01:55:20,320
[SPEAKER_02]: This is like where Onuken and stuff got its start, is with BMS files.

1349
01:55:21,100 --> 01:55:24,503
[SPEAKER_02]: And you really... I'm sorry, the U.S.

1350
01:55:24,563 --> 01:55:25,684
[SPEAKER_02]: is not going to be able to come close.

1351
01:55:26,064 --> 01:55:33,870
[SPEAKER_02]: They can try, but I already have high standards for BMS files, and I'm afraid, like most everything else that the U.S.

1352
01:55:33,950 --> 01:55:35,491
[SPEAKER_02]: does as far as sim files go...

1353
01:55:36,058 --> 01:55:37,119
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna be disappointed.

1354
01:55:37,659 --> 01:55:42,303
[SPEAKER_02]: But, hey, you know, I'd like to still see what comes of this because it'll be interesting.

1355
01:55:42,323 --> 01:55:45,486
[SPEAKER_02]: There's gotta be at least one quality file that comes with it.

1356
01:55:45,526 --> 01:55:49,049
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, I'm sure there's gonna be some good stuff, but there's gonna be some crap stuff too.

1357
01:55:49,209 --> 01:55:52,352
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have the patience to make a StepMania file, let alone a BMS file.

1358
01:55:52,652 --> 01:55:55,935
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, I bet the three of us could get together and do a really good...

1359
01:55:56,758 --> 01:55:57,359
[SPEAKER_20]: BMS.

1360
01:55:58,220 --> 01:56:01,704
[SPEAKER_02]: There's better things we could spend our time doing, like eating.

1361
01:56:01,944 --> 01:56:02,264
[SPEAKER_02]: Sleeping.

1362
01:56:02,925 --> 01:56:03,385
[SPEAKER_02]: Sleeping.

1363
01:56:05,528 --> 01:56:06,268
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, yeah.

1364
01:56:06,949 --> 01:56:08,691
[SPEAKER_02]: Or working on our station or something.

1365
01:56:08,751 --> 01:56:09,572
[SPEAKER_02]: Doing promos.

1366
01:56:11,094 --> 01:56:11,394
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1367
01:56:11,654 --> 01:56:12,315
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't do those.

1368
01:56:14,158 --> 01:56:17,801
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, so there's nothing really going on as far as that item is concerned.

1369
01:56:20,744 --> 01:56:21,184
[SPEAKER_02]: What else?

1370
01:56:21,544 --> 01:56:24,947
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, there's some more boss files released by DJ Pato.

1371
01:56:25,568 --> 01:56:29,911
[SPEAKER_02]: Who, like most other people, call themselves DJ, is not a DJ.

1372
01:56:30,792 --> 01:56:33,314
[SPEAKER_02]: And boss files are retarded, I like to mention.

1373
01:56:35,396 --> 01:56:37,418
[SPEAKER_02]: For those who don't know what boss files are, they're incredibly hard...

1374
01:56:40,014 --> 01:56:45,817
[SPEAKER_02]: and DWIs that are basically Beatmania for Stepmania, which is just crap.

1375
01:56:46,097 --> 01:56:47,938
[SPEAKER_02]: It's crap, it's crap, it's crap.

1376
01:56:48,358 --> 01:56:48,958
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't play them.

1377
01:56:49,919 --> 01:56:58,723
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man, that's like the number one problem with Stepmania files out there on the internet is they're all trying to be Beatmania because nobody plays Stepmania with an actual dance pad.

1378
01:56:58,743 --> 01:57:06,587
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all using their fingers, and when they AAA songs, they're taking screen gaps of it and posting how big their internet penis is because they AAA'd a song with their fingers on a dance game.

1379
01:57:08,311 --> 01:57:11,474
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they complain because a lot of the ten-footers and stuff are too easy.

1380
01:57:11,494 --> 01:57:13,536
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, because you're using your fingers, dumbass.

1381
01:57:13,636 --> 01:57:14,376
[SPEAKER_02]: Try using your feet.

1382
01:57:16,118 --> 01:57:16,618
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

1383
01:57:17,039 --> 01:57:17,279
[SPEAKER_25]: Anyway.

1384
01:57:18,980 --> 01:57:20,642
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, you guys want to hear who won tonight's cage match?

1385
01:57:21,322 --> 01:57:21,663
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure!

1386
01:57:22,640 --> 01:57:33,068
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, you know what's interesting is that last week I think we had the most number of votes I've ever seen in a cage match in recent memory, and this week we have some of the least number of votes in a cage match in recent memory, so I don't know what's up.

1387
01:57:33,708 --> 01:57:34,148
[SPEAKER_02]: Family guy.

1388
01:57:34,489 --> 01:57:34,729
[SPEAKER_02]: Huh?

1389
01:57:35,049 --> 01:57:35,509
[SPEAKER_02]: Family guy.

1390
01:57:35,709 --> 01:57:36,790
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it because of family guy?

1391
01:57:37,090 --> 01:57:38,371
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on, people.

1392
01:57:38,491 --> 01:57:40,273
[SPEAKER_02]: It was leaked to the internet like two weeks ago.

1393
01:57:40,293 --> 01:57:42,234
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, I've had it on my PC all week.

1394
01:57:43,135 --> 01:57:46,517
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get a torrent later or stop being cheap and buy a TiVo.

1395
01:57:46,857 --> 01:57:48,719
[SPEAKER_02]: We are far more important than that damn show.

1396
01:57:48,739 --> 01:57:50,480
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll just cancel it again, and you'll be sad.

1397
01:57:51,540 --> 01:57:53,121
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man, that show's awesome.

1398
01:57:53,342 --> 01:57:55,203
[SPEAKER_02]: But our show's awesomer.

1399
01:57:55,403 --> 01:57:56,424
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right, we're awesomer.

1400
01:57:56,965 --> 01:58:04,491
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, anyway, tonight's cage match winner is... In the name... Not in the name of love, my bad.

1401
01:58:04,531 --> 01:58:05,792
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing can live forever.

1402
01:58:05,812 --> 01:58:06,592
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god.

1403
01:58:07,753 --> 01:58:09,455
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought gorillas would have won the game.

1404
01:58:09,495 --> 01:58:11,076
[SPEAKER_02]: Yuzo Koshiro.

1405
01:58:12,992 --> 01:58:21,135
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, maybe on another night where everybody was voting, but tonight we only had... Oh my god, I was expecting this was a filler song until I picked a good one.

1406
01:58:21,415 --> 01:58:22,235
[SPEAKER_02]: Eh, it always works that way.

1407
01:58:22,255 --> 01:58:26,957
[SPEAKER_20]: Just wait until after we get back from E3 and the Demon Days album is actually released so I can put that one song in.

1408
01:58:27,317 --> 01:58:29,617
[SPEAKER_20]: Because I can't put it in before the album's out.

1409
01:58:30,618 --> 01:58:31,498
[SPEAKER_20]: Out of support for the band.

1410
01:58:32,781 --> 01:58:34,822
[SPEAKER_20]: I have to say it wasn't a bad song.

1411
01:58:35,663 --> 01:58:37,283
[SPEAKER_02]: You could play it.

1412
01:58:38,024 --> 01:58:39,864
[SPEAKER_02]: I will actually go ahead and say it was a bad song.

1413
01:58:43,086 --> 01:58:44,166
[SPEAKER_18]: I could, but I won't.

1414
01:58:44,186 --> 01:58:46,287
[SPEAKER_02]: I know right away it was a bad song.

1415
01:58:46,307 --> 01:58:47,268
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I put it in.

1416
01:58:48,848 --> 01:58:51,470
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't see how you could call my song repetitive and then put that in.

1417
01:58:52,210 --> 01:58:53,631
[SPEAKER_20]: I could play it, but I won't.

1418
01:58:53,891 --> 01:58:55,411
[SPEAKER_20]: Out of respect for my favorite band.

1419
01:58:57,032 --> 01:58:57,572
[SPEAKER_02]: I could play it.

1420
01:58:58,873 --> 01:58:59,373
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm teasing.

1421
01:58:59,873 --> 01:59:00,113
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway,

1422
01:59:02,130 --> 01:59:02,530
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

1423
01:59:03,111 --> 01:59:03,791
[SPEAKER_02]: What are we going to do now?

1424
01:59:03,952 --> 01:59:06,834
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I want to do the DDR Freak Post of the Week.

1425
01:59:06,854 --> 01:59:09,176
[SPEAKER_02]: Because this is exciting.

1426
01:59:09,216 --> 01:59:14,840
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, DDR Freak does run our Rewinds every Friday night over on The Freak.

1427
01:59:15,301 --> 01:59:16,782
[SPEAKER_02]: So you guys should check that out.

1428
01:59:17,623 --> 01:59:23,207
[SPEAKER_02]: If you ever miss part of this show, so if you must skip us and go watch Family Guy...

1429
01:59:24,808 --> 01:59:28,010
[SPEAKER_02]: I suppose you could catch up with us on Friday night over on DDR Free.

1430
01:59:28,170 --> 01:59:31,732
[SPEAKER_02]: We're on the same week now, so tonight's show you will hear this Friday.

1431
01:59:31,752 --> 01:59:32,833
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to wait a week anymore.

1432
01:59:33,153 --> 01:59:37,215
[SPEAKER_02]: Granted, folks, I mean, you could download this DVD quality on the internet.

1433
01:59:37,596 --> 01:59:38,496
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on my PSP.

1434
01:59:38,696 --> 01:59:39,977
[SPEAKER_02]: We watched it yesterday.

1435
01:59:39,997 --> 01:59:41,778
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I watched it on Loki's PSP already.

1436
01:59:41,838 --> 01:59:44,760
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, and granted, it was very funny.

1437
01:59:45,580 --> 01:59:47,982
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still the same level of funny as it used to be.

1438
01:59:48,002 --> 01:59:53,725
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, it's really funny, and I highly recommend it, but because it's against our show, I'm sorry, but you can't go.

1439
01:59:55,094 --> 01:59:55,774
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly, folks.

1440
01:59:55,814 --> 01:59:56,535
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll rerun it.

1441
01:59:57,075 --> 01:59:58,176
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they'll rerun it.

1442
01:59:58,636 --> 02:00:00,097
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get it on BitTorrent.

1443
02:00:00,417 --> 02:00:02,378
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get it TiVo, stopping cheap.

1444
02:00:02,538 --> 02:00:03,639
[SPEAKER_02]: Set your VCR.

1445
02:00:05,900 --> 02:00:08,522
[SPEAKER_02]: Or tape us, I suppose, but it's a little harder to tape the internet.

1446
02:00:08,622 --> 02:00:12,844
[SPEAKER_02]: Or buy Satellite and, you know, watch it East Coast time.

1447
02:00:12,864 --> 02:00:13,224
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

1448
02:00:13,304 --> 02:00:15,326
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go, because East Coast people saw it before our show was on.

1449
02:00:15,486 --> 02:00:15,866
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

1450
02:00:16,086 --> 02:00:19,228
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, let's get to the DDR Freak Post of the Week.

1451
02:00:22,072 --> 02:00:27,216
[SPEAKER_02]: A bunch of crazies over there on DDR Freak.

1452
02:00:27,396 --> 02:00:27,896
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm kidding.

1453
02:00:28,476 --> 02:00:30,037
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some really great people on DDR Freak.

1454
02:00:30,057 --> 02:00:33,200
[SPEAKER_02]: But once in a while, you get a few loonies that make very interesting posts.

1455
02:00:33,520 --> 02:00:36,522
[SPEAKER_02]: And tonight's DDR Freak Post of the Week was suggested to me by one of our chatters.

1456
02:00:36,982 --> 02:00:40,965
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to say it was LXLDubes that suggested this one.

1457
02:00:41,185 --> 02:00:43,466
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it wasn't you and it was somebody else, I apologize to that person.

1458
02:00:43,587 --> 02:00:44,067
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was him.

1459
02:00:46,048 --> 02:00:46,248
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1460
02:00:47,289 --> 02:00:47,369
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh.

1461
02:00:47,829 --> 02:00:50,251
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Post of the Week, this is not TurboGrafx segment.

1462
02:00:50,271 --> 02:00:51,292
[SPEAKER_02]: This is DDR Freak Post of the Week.

1463
02:00:51,312 --> 02:00:51,492
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

1464
02:00:53,929 --> 02:00:54,610
[SPEAKER_02]: Subject.

1465
02:00:55,270 --> 02:00:56,571
[SPEAKER_02]: The subject for this post.

1466
02:00:57,392 --> 02:00:59,094
[SPEAKER_02]: DDR Fairy Tales.

1467
02:00:59,794 --> 02:01:03,618
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, I came so close to locking that damn thread, and then I thought, nah.

1468
02:01:03,938 --> 02:01:04,438
[SPEAKER_02]: Here it is.

1469
02:01:05,079 --> 02:01:05,799
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the post.

1470
02:01:06,400 --> 02:01:08,722
[SPEAKER_02]: I just thought this would be a funny idea.

1471
02:01:09,382 --> 02:01:14,727
[SPEAKER_02]: Try to make a random fairy tale out of as many DDR song titles as possible.

1472
02:01:15,147 --> 02:01:15,648
[SPEAKER_02]: Good luck.

1473
02:01:16,989 --> 02:01:20,252
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, okay, that post isn't that great, but let's see some of the replies.

1474
02:01:22,419 --> 02:01:28,625
[SPEAKER_30]: Once upon a time, in the kingdom of Max 300, there was a noble prince named Jam Jam Reggae.

1475
02:01:30,967 --> 02:01:33,289
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, Yam Yam Ragu.

1476
02:01:34,210 --> 02:01:35,752
[SPEAKER_30]: What the hell was that?

1477
02:01:36,192 --> 02:01:38,674
[SPEAKER_30]: I don't know anybody named Jam Jam Reggae, do you?

1478
02:01:39,315 --> 02:01:40,456
[SPEAKER_30]: Makes no sense whatsoever.

1479
02:01:42,918 --> 02:01:43,539
[SPEAKER_30]: Uh, let's see.

1480
02:01:44,481 --> 02:01:55,308
[SPEAKER_02]: Once upon a time, a prince upon a star, which is a Beatmania song, not a DDR song, visited the Queens, Jamaica, again, Beatmania, not DDR, where he met a man named Gamble.

1481
02:01:55,388 --> 02:02:01,311
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to get technical, you know, they were in a club mix, whatever.

1482
02:02:01,892 --> 02:02:03,293
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, he met a man named Gamble.

1483
02:02:03,433 --> 02:02:04,773
[SPEAKER_02]: But these songs weren't made famous.

1484
02:02:05,794 --> 02:02:06,955
[SPEAKER_02]: They were first in Beatmania.

1485
02:02:06,975 --> 02:02:07,255
[SPEAKER_02]: Shut up.

1486
02:02:07,851 --> 02:02:11,153
[SPEAKER_02]: This man had a lovely senorita named Nori Nori Nori.

1487
02:02:11,553 --> 02:02:16,156
[SPEAKER_02]: Then they all died because they got ran over by a cowgirl going maximum overdrive.

1488
02:02:16,256 --> 02:02:16,696
[SPEAKER_02]: The end.

1489
02:02:19,518 --> 02:02:24,581
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, these share the same place in my heart as with those three-word stories.

1490
02:02:26,522 --> 02:02:32,046
[SPEAKER_02]: There was one that went on for like a whole page, and if you think I'm reading it, you're freaking crazy.

1491
02:02:33,226 --> 02:02:34,187
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll read one more here.

1492
02:02:35,128 --> 02:02:35,528
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

1493
02:02:39,362 --> 02:02:43,325
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, this was Alex L. Dubes that recommended it because he made a post in here.

1494
02:02:43,345 --> 02:02:45,807
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, DDR fairy tales, ooh, ooh, let me try.

1495
02:02:46,087 --> 02:02:48,189
[SPEAKER_02]: There once was a village of people who had no life.

1496
02:02:48,229 --> 02:02:50,651
[SPEAKER_02]: And what a surprise, there was a DDR machine in the village.

1497
02:02:53,092 --> 02:02:53,793
[SPEAKER_20]: That one's good.

1498
02:02:54,493 --> 02:02:56,835
[SPEAKER_20]: You know what we need to actually do instead of the fairy tales?

1499
02:02:56,875 --> 02:02:58,036
[SPEAKER_20]: We need DDR limericks.

1500
02:02:58,957 --> 02:02:59,637
[SPEAKER_20]: Dirty ones.

1501
02:03:00,017 --> 02:03:01,338
[SPEAKER_02]: Dirty DDR limericks?

1502
02:03:01,739 --> 02:03:01,959
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

1503
02:03:01,979 --> 02:03:02,059
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

1504
02:03:02,887 --> 02:03:04,788
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this one starts out, it might sound dirty.

1505
02:03:04,808 --> 02:03:06,450
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the last one I'm going to read.

1506
02:03:06,890 --> 02:03:09,652
[SPEAKER_02]: Once upon a time, there was a man named Max, period.

1507
02:03:10,212 --> 02:03:12,374
[SPEAKER_02]: He went up to a La Senorita.

1508
02:03:12,754 --> 02:03:14,395
[SPEAKER_02]: Buenos dias, he yelled.

1509
02:03:17,177 --> 02:03:19,819
[SPEAKER_30]: I think buenos dias should be a DDR song.

1510
02:03:20,780 --> 02:03:21,820
[SPEAKER_30]: Buenos dias!

1511
02:03:24,803 --> 02:03:25,503
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god.

1512
02:03:25,863 --> 02:03:30,006
[SPEAKER_08]: They needed a Spanish version of Max.

1513
02:03:30,607 --> 02:03:30,867
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1514
02:03:31,007 --> 02:03:32,448
[SPEAKER_02]: They needed a Spanish version of Max.

1515
02:03:36,706 --> 02:03:37,147
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

1516
02:03:37,427 --> 02:03:38,588
[SPEAKER_02]: He went up to a La Senorita.

1517
02:03:38,628 --> 02:03:39,849
[SPEAKER_02]: Buenos dias, he yelled.

1518
02:03:40,209 --> 02:03:41,811
[SPEAKER_02]: He then offered her some candy.

1519
02:03:42,551 --> 02:03:46,314
[SPEAKER_02]: All of a sudden, in a wild rush, she began to scream, waka laka.

1520
02:03:46,855 --> 02:03:48,356
[SPEAKER_02]: Max yelled, don't break down.

1521
02:03:48,816 --> 02:03:50,357
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait a minute, she screamed.

1522
02:03:50,598 --> 02:03:51,799
[SPEAKER_02]: You have broken my heart.

1523
02:03:52,359 --> 02:03:55,081
[SPEAKER_02]: He then began to feel like he hit a dead end.

1524
02:03:55,562 --> 02:03:58,084
[SPEAKER_02]: You've been cheating on me, huh, Max, period, she screamed.

1525
02:03:58,786 --> 02:04:00,747
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to share my love, he responded.

1526
02:04:01,107 --> 02:04:02,448
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing gonna stop, he added.

1527
02:04:02,889 --> 02:04:04,670
[SPEAKER_02]: She then said, make love to me.

1528
02:04:05,290 --> 02:04:07,331
[SPEAKER_02]: The reflex took over and they banged.

1529
02:04:07,651 --> 02:04:08,732
[SPEAKER_02]: The end of the century.

1530
02:04:10,773 --> 02:04:11,734
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, that one's good.

1531
02:04:11,814 --> 02:04:12,394
[SPEAKER_20]: That one's good.

1532
02:04:13,495 --> 02:04:15,716
[SPEAKER_20]: That one wins a lack of angst for me.

1533
02:04:18,478 --> 02:04:20,719
[SPEAKER_30]: The reflex took over and, well, they banged.

1534
02:04:21,840 --> 02:04:22,540
[SPEAKER_30]: Buenos dias!

1535
02:04:23,281 --> 02:04:24,462
[SPEAKER_15]: Buenos dias!

1536
02:04:31,836 --> 02:04:34,096
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the way people write on DDR free.

1537
02:04:34,496 --> 02:04:36,857
[SPEAKER_02]: The reflex took over and, you know, they banged.

1538
02:04:40,778 --> 02:04:41,578
[SPEAKER_02]: Did she bang?

1539
02:04:43,179 --> 02:04:47,900
[SPEAKER_02]: Comment from our chat room and VXJasonXV really wants me to read this because he's posted it three times.

1540
02:04:48,420 --> 02:04:53,242
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was a fairy tale, not a retardation and bastardization of song titles.

1541
02:04:54,402 --> 02:04:55,683
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on, Jason.

1542
02:04:55,723 --> 02:04:56,583
[SPEAKER_02]: Buenos dias.

1543
02:04:58,460 --> 02:05:00,480
[SPEAKER_02]: Fairy Tailgate because it's a song.

1544
02:05:03,481 --> 02:05:04,201
[SPEAKER_30]: Let's go to break.

1545
02:05:07,462 --> 02:05:09,422
[SPEAKER_02]: In this break, we're going to hear... You know what?

1546
02:05:09,482 --> 02:05:12,102
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that I've said... Oh, wait.

1547
02:05:13,003 --> 02:05:14,343
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got to talk about something.

1548
02:05:14,363 --> 02:05:14,883
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, what?

1549
02:05:15,723 --> 02:05:18,764
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember that we posted something about Karaoke Revolution?

1550
02:05:19,444 --> 02:05:21,104
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, what do you want to say about Karaoke Revolution?

1551
02:05:21,844 --> 02:05:24,164
[SPEAKER_02]: There's that song from Dirty Dancing in it.

1552
02:05:24,585 --> 02:05:26,665
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm scared because there's a Karaoke Revolution 4.

1553
02:05:27,762 --> 02:05:28,082
[SPEAKER_02]: The end.

1554
02:05:57,395 --> 02:05:58,737
[SPEAKER_02]: Buenos dias, Max 300.

1555
02:05:58,797 --> 02:06:00,459
[SPEAKER_02]: Buenos dias, El Bimbo.

1556
02:06:00,780 --> 02:06:02,422
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge.

1557
02:06:27,368 --> 02:06:28,408
Thanks for watching!

1558
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:03,320
Thanks for watching!

1559
02:07:42,798 --> 02:07:43,861
Thanks for watching!

1560
02:09:03,703 --> 02:09:04,612
[SPEAKER_13]: Now this is...

1561
02:09:36,531 --> 02:09:37,892
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1562
02:10:13,488 --> 02:10:13,908
Check it out.

1563
02:11:02,722 --> 02:11:07,816
[SPEAKER_13]: Why do you cry when you're happy It's just something special

1564
02:12:19,813 --> 02:12:24,614
[SPEAKER_13]: From StepSquad to OrangeLounge, this PDR sucks!

1565
02:12:24,994 --> 02:12:29,676
[SPEAKER_13]: Holler!

1566
02:12:30,616 --> 02:12:40,358
[SPEAKER_02]: P-T-P-O Hi, we're back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 140 in progress.

1567
02:12:41,139 --> 02:12:45,720
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to get into the FUs of the week relatively shortly, but first... Cool.

1568
02:12:46,607 --> 02:12:46,988
[SPEAKER_02]: SILENT HILL Um...

1569
02:13:04,694 --> 02:13:08,516
[SPEAKER_20]: Really, my updates are just from over the week.

1570
02:13:09,136 --> 02:13:11,538
[SPEAKER_20]: The basic story, of course, has been out on the web for some time.

1571
02:13:12,318 --> 02:13:13,398
[SPEAKER_20]: They're in pre-production now.

1572
02:13:14,979 --> 02:13:17,420
[SPEAKER_02]: For the Silent Hill movie, correct?

1573
02:13:17,521 --> 02:13:20,702
[SPEAKER_20]: So far, cast is Radha Mitchell from Finding Neverland.

1574
02:13:21,042 --> 02:13:24,304
[SPEAKER_20]: Sean Bean is in it as her character's husband.

1575
02:13:26,165 --> 02:13:28,506
[SPEAKER_20]: For Lord of the Rings fans, he was Boromir.

1576
02:13:29,387 --> 02:13:33,609
[SPEAKER_20]: And then somebody named Jodell Ferlin as the daughter in the movie.

1577
02:13:34,921 --> 02:13:40,684
[SPEAKER_20]: But there's a... They were saying in this one article, and I'll link it in the chat room in just a moment.

1578
02:13:42,625 --> 02:13:51,469
[SPEAKER_20]: They had the production cost, I think it's... It's expected to top $25,000 per day during the shoot.

1579
02:13:52,129 --> 02:13:55,491
[SPEAKER_20]: So it's going to be, of course, several million dollars to produce this movie.

1580
02:13:55,511 --> 02:13:56,511
[SPEAKER_20]: They've got big hopes for it.

1581
02:13:57,772 --> 02:13:59,193
[SPEAKER_20]: There are pictures out on the net...

1582
02:14:00,106 --> 02:14:04,108
[SPEAKER_20]: Trying to find the link I had that had like 60 some odd pre-production pictures.

1583
02:14:04,128 --> 02:14:07,830
[SPEAKER_02]: There actually is a link on OrangeScienceRadio.com and the story we ran earlier this week has a link to it.

1584
02:14:08,251 --> 02:14:09,631
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's still valid, which I think it is.

1585
02:14:10,092 --> 02:14:10,932
[SPEAKER_20]: Actually, I do believe it is.

1586
02:14:11,913 --> 02:14:15,274
[SPEAKER_20]: But I'm also going to copy this article for the chat room.

1587
02:14:15,375 --> 02:14:16,075
[SPEAKER_20]: It's really good.

1588
02:14:17,696 --> 02:14:22,418
[SPEAKER_20]: And it's talking about actually the town that they're filming it in and how the people are reacting to it.

1589
02:14:24,259 --> 02:14:24,840
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool.

1590
02:14:25,340 --> 02:14:25,700
[SPEAKER_02]: There it is.

1591
02:14:25,820 --> 02:14:27,641
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking forward to that movie very much.

1592
02:14:27,841 --> 02:14:28,302
[SPEAKER_02]: It should be...

1593
02:14:30,606 --> 02:14:32,727
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hoping that they stay loyal to the games.

1594
02:14:33,128 --> 02:14:36,129
[SPEAKER_02]: If they stay loyal to the games, it'll be so cool.

1595
02:14:37,110 --> 02:14:39,711
[SPEAKER_02]: But if they try to do the Resident Evil thing, it's going to suck.

1596
02:14:40,091 --> 02:14:43,593
[SPEAKER_02]: So I really hope they don't turn it into like zombie horror action film.

1597
02:14:45,414 --> 02:14:47,596
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, kind of that subtle mess with your mind.

1598
02:14:47,676 --> 02:14:51,198
[SPEAKER_20]: I think it's going to stay with the way the games are, honestly.

1599
02:14:51,758 --> 02:14:53,299
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hopeful from the pictures.

1600
02:14:53,459 --> 02:14:53,819
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm very hopeful.

1601
02:14:53,839 --> 02:14:55,540
[SPEAKER_20]: It doesn't seem like it's exactly the same.

1602
02:14:55,660 --> 02:14:59,282
[SPEAKER_20]: Because you know how in the games everybody is linked to the whole...

1603
02:15:04,250 --> 02:15:11,593
[SPEAKER_20]: This one seems almost like it would be an innocent bystander just caught up in what's going on, from what I can tell.

1604
02:15:12,294 --> 02:15:12,974
[SPEAKER_20]: It's looking pretty cool.

1605
02:15:14,175 --> 02:15:15,275
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hoping it comes out soon.

1606
02:15:15,295 --> 02:15:17,476
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's not out until next year, but you never know what might happen.

1607
02:15:18,237 --> 02:15:18,657
[SPEAKER_20]: I need this.

1608
02:15:19,678 --> 02:15:22,380
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, it's time for the FUs of the week, boys and girls.

1609
02:15:22,440 --> 02:15:28,464
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to send in an FU of the week, send your private message to Sky in the chat room with whatever you want to give an FU to.

1610
02:15:28,504 --> 02:15:31,666
[SPEAKER_02]: Please keep them short, as we've got a lot of people that probably want to get their FUs in.

1611
02:15:32,106 --> 02:15:34,808
[SPEAKER_02]: If your FU goes on and on and on, you will get cut off!

1612
02:15:35,649 --> 02:15:36,249
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like that.

1613
02:15:36,669 --> 02:15:38,090
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have to read your FU anyway.

1614
02:15:39,091 --> 02:15:41,112
[SPEAKER_02]: But we will, because we know you're angsty like us.

1615
02:15:41,473 --> 02:15:45,015
[SPEAKER_02]: So DarkSakura, why is it that we do the FUs of the week every single week?

1616
02:15:46,936 --> 02:15:48,177
[SPEAKER_20]: Because Jamie can't have chocolate.

1617
02:16:05,728 --> 02:16:09,911
[SPEAKER_20]: Fuck you to car accidents and all the shit that's happened in my car, god damn it.

1618
02:16:10,731 --> 02:16:14,093
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, I loved my CD player even though it was a piece of shit.

1619
02:16:14,853 --> 02:16:17,735
[SPEAKER_20]: And I loved my car even though it's also a piece of shit.

1620
02:16:18,590 --> 02:16:20,931
[SPEAKER_20]: But I didn't need to be in the goddamn accident.

1621
02:16:21,171 --> 02:16:27,712
[SPEAKER_20]: I certainly am tired of not being able to walk up a damn flight of stairs because my hip hurts like in excruciating pain.

1622
02:16:27,732 --> 02:16:31,413
[SPEAKER_20]: This is after Vicodin and Flexerol, so fuck the whole thing.

1623
02:16:31,453 --> 02:16:32,793
[SPEAKER_20]: This is what I'm angsty about.

1624
02:16:33,534 --> 02:16:39,835
[SPEAKER_20]: And also, I hate taking the medication anyway because it makes my head feel all funny.

1625
02:16:40,095 --> 02:16:43,776
[SPEAKER_20]: And when my head feels funny, I tend to say weird things and tend to just go off on people.

1626
02:16:44,235 --> 02:17:03,475
[SPEAKER_20]: and I went off on people at work and that's not good so I ended up going home because I went off on people um just I hate feeling like this I hate the crap that's happening in my car and honestly I wish that someone would just run into my car with a semi so that their insurance would buy me a brand new fucking car

1627
02:17:04,565 --> 02:17:08,526
[SPEAKER_20]: Also, F you to my apartment complex and the stupid bitch that manages it.

1628
02:17:08,886 --> 02:17:14,828
[SPEAKER_20]: She doesn't do her job for shit and keeps letting these wannabe thug gangsters move in next door.

1629
02:17:15,489 --> 02:17:17,309
[SPEAKER_20]: And it's no longer a safe place to live.

1630
02:17:17,389 --> 02:17:24,372
[SPEAKER_20]: I also fucking hate the stupid cost of houses in this state, especially in Sacramento.

1631
02:17:24,572 --> 02:17:26,432
[SPEAKER_20]: The Bay Area, of course, is a lot more expensive.

1632
02:17:26,953 --> 02:17:28,873
[SPEAKER_20]: But it's hard to find a house for under $350,000.

1633
02:17:29,393 --> 02:17:34,155
[SPEAKER_20]: And if we have to move out to Yuba City to freaking have a house

1634
02:17:34,730 --> 02:17:42,052
[SPEAKER_20]: that is worth a damn and not have to, you know, pay everything for the rest of our lives to have this house, then so be it.

1635
02:17:42,092 --> 02:17:49,235
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, I'll put up with the extra drive, but I did find a cute house, though, but it's small and they want a bunch for it.

1636
02:17:49,935 --> 02:17:51,395
[SPEAKER_20]: It's just a nightmare, you know.

1637
02:17:52,516 --> 02:17:54,116
[SPEAKER_20]: I fucking hate growing up now.

1638
02:17:54,876 --> 02:17:56,597
[SPEAKER_20]: Isn't this going to be nice to have a house?

1639
02:17:57,397 --> 02:18:00,898
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, life's going to suck when you grow up, when you grow up, when you grow up.

1640
02:18:03,019 --> 02:18:03,099
[SPEAKER_20]: Ugh.

1641
02:18:06,327 --> 02:18:13,833
[SPEAKER_20]: All of you kids in the chatroom, you have no right to complain about living with your parents because you don't have to pay for shit.

1642
02:18:14,953 --> 02:18:19,417
[SPEAKER_20]: If I hear you bitching one more time, I'm going to come to your house and slap you upside the head.

1643
02:18:19,657 --> 02:18:22,700
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless you aren't paying the mortgage by yourself, then you can't bitch.

1644
02:18:22,900 --> 02:18:23,681
[SPEAKER_20]: Or pay rent.

1645
02:18:24,902 --> 02:18:27,183
[SPEAKER_20]: And even then, you can move out when you're fucking 18.

1646
02:18:28,308 --> 02:18:30,969
[SPEAKER_20]: Although I don't recommend it, live with your parents as long as you can.

1647
02:18:31,049 --> 02:18:33,070
[SPEAKER_20]: Milk them for every cent they're worth.

1648
02:18:33,830 --> 02:18:36,411
[SPEAKER_20]: Because it's such when you have to do it all by yourself.

1649
02:18:37,812 --> 02:18:38,152
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm done.

1650
02:18:39,593 --> 02:18:40,073
[SPEAKER_30]: Loki.

1651
02:18:44,795 --> 02:18:46,516
[SPEAKER_30]: Chocolate good.

1652
02:18:48,316 --> 02:18:48,937
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but anyways.

1653
02:18:49,317 --> 02:18:50,397
[SPEAKER_02]: Now the chocolate's gone.

1654
02:18:52,558 --> 02:18:53,679
[SPEAKER_02]: I need more chocolate.

1655
02:18:53,899 --> 02:18:54,379
[SPEAKER_02]: Now.

1656
02:18:54,739 --> 02:18:55,059
[SPEAKER_02]: That.

1657
02:18:55,539 --> 02:18:55,840
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways.

1658
02:18:57,395 --> 02:19:05,266
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I was, um, I'm very pissed off at the fact of just my weekends being, in general, like, too busy for me.

1659
02:19:05,306 --> 02:19:08,271
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even get a chance to actually, like, relax during the whole weekend.

1660
02:19:09,673 --> 02:19:10,534
[SPEAKER_02]: No other peanut butter cups.

1661
02:19:10,694 --> 02:19:11,695
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate peanut butter cups.

1662
02:19:12,076 --> 02:19:13,418
[SPEAKER_02]: I like expensive chocolates.

1663
02:19:17,340 --> 02:19:19,802
[SPEAKER_02]: I like non-expensive chocolates that used to be expensive.

1664
02:19:20,202 --> 02:19:24,946
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, um... So fuck you to goddamn weekends being too damn long.

1665
02:19:25,286 --> 02:19:31,011
[SPEAKER_02]: And fuck you to having to drive... Just... Stressful, okay?

1666
02:19:33,192 --> 02:19:33,653
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you!

1667
02:19:34,754 --> 02:19:35,454
[SPEAKER_02]: I get more chocolates.

1668
02:19:36,475 --> 02:19:37,696
[SPEAKER_02]: Um... Anyways...

1669
02:19:38,086 --> 02:19:41,088
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck you to bad drivers, because they're everywhere.

1670
02:19:41,728 --> 02:19:42,609
[SPEAKER_02]: Everywhere, everywhere.

1671
02:19:42,669 --> 02:19:49,514
[SPEAKER_02]: I was coming home from dropping off Rob yesterday, and this guy zips past me at like 50 miles an hour faster than where I'm going.

1672
02:19:49,754 --> 02:19:52,836
[SPEAKER_02]: Granted, I'm going about 75 on the freeway.

1673
02:19:53,176 --> 02:19:56,598
[SPEAKER_02]: He's just all... No, I was in the car when that happened.

1674
02:19:56,718 --> 02:19:57,599
[SPEAKER_02]: That guy was crazy.

1675
02:19:57,839 --> 02:19:59,340
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't even know what that was.

1676
02:19:59,560 --> 02:20:00,841
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that was just nuts.

1677
02:20:02,338 --> 02:20:06,280
[SPEAKER_02]: People, honestly, I mean, I see, I'm going like, you know, 75 or something.

1678
02:20:06,340 --> 02:20:11,522
[SPEAKER_02]: I consider that pretty, you know, that's some pretty good speeding right there.

1679
02:20:11,542 --> 02:20:14,924
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you don't want to go crazy because, you know, there's a lot of cars out there.

1680
02:20:15,004 --> 02:20:16,985
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's people that are zooming past me, you know.

1681
02:20:17,560 --> 02:20:31,761
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like, nothing, you know, I don't understand why everyone's in such a hurry nowadays, and it was funny though, today, one person did just like the same thing, you know, zoomed right past me, and then a cop car zoomed right past me and pulled the sucker over.

1682
02:20:32,522 --> 02:20:33,143
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that was great.

1683
02:20:34,464 --> 02:20:43,354
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, then, um, what was that, I was gonna say, um, fuck you to, uh, Live365 for not giving me more, uh, free crap.

1684
02:20:43,875 --> 02:20:47,259
[SPEAKER_02]: I like free crap, and all I got was a stupid t-shirt that I'm probably not gonna wear.

1685
02:20:48,041 --> 02:20:49,643
[SPEAKER_02]: Last year we had a lot more free crap.

1686
02:20:49,884 --> 02:20:51,346
[SPEAKER_02]: We got a lot more free crap last year.

1687
02:20:51,386 --> 02:20:53,429
[SPEAKER_02]: I was very disappointed at the lack of free crap this year.

1688
02:20:53,449 --> 02:20:57,074
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just like, I'm trying to figure out why, what exactly cost the $20.

1689
02:20:57,755 --> 02:20:59,177
[SPEAKER_02]: What am I getting for this $20?

1690
02:20:59,217 --> 02:20:59,938
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I want to know.

1691
02:20:59,978 --> 02:21:04,485
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to see that girl sing those dirty ass lyrics about that guy being up all in her.

1692
02:21:06,010 --> 02:21:10,233
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but I wasn't that guy all up in her, so it wasn't really, you know, worth the $20.

1693
02:21:10,293 --> 02:21:12,275
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I'm trying to say.

1694
02:21:12,295 --> 02:21:17,238
[SPEAKER_02]: If you'd gotten a chance to go up all in her, and she wrote that song about you, would it have been worth the $20?

1695
02:21:17,278 --> 02:21:18,479
[SPEAKER_02]: That would have been worth the $20.

1696
02:21:19,500 --> 02:21:20,420
[SPEAKER_29]: I got two things.

1697
02:21:20,741 --> 02:21:22,442
[SPEAKER_29]: One, I've got a bunch of free crap coming.

1698
02:21:22,462 --> 02:21:23,643
[SPEAKER_29]: You can have it free.

1699
02:21:23,843 --> 02:21:26,985
[SPEAKER_29]: I'll drop it in the toilet or something if you want.

1700
02:21:27,005 --> 02:21:27,806
[SPEAKER_29]: Two, hold on, two.

1701
02:21:28,328 --> 02:21:33,913
[SPEAKER_29]: You guys have to pay to go to the awards, even though you are on the ballot, so to speak.

1702
02:21:34,273 --> 02:21:36,294
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's play a fun game, LankyStyle.

1703
02:21:36,535 --> 02:21:38,977
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's play how much was each ticket.

1704
02:21:39,017 --> 02:21:44,021
[SPEAKER_02]: No, better yet, let's play how much did it cost for all three of us to go to the awards ceremony.

1705
02:21:44,501 --> 02:21:45,202
[SPEAKER_02]: Guess now.

1706
02:21:45,222 --> 02:21:45,202
$100.

1707
02:21:45,582 --> 02:21:45,662
[SPEAKER_02]: Less.

1708
02:21:49,099 --> 02:21:49,539
[SPEAKER_02]: 75.

1709
02:21:49,239 --> 02:21:49,539
[SPEAKER_02]: Less.

1710
02:21:50,019 --> 02:21:50,740
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this is no fun.

1711
02:21:50,780 --> 02:21:51,460
[SPEAKER_02]: He's guessing high.

1712
02:21:52,120 --> 02:21:53,100
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm including gas.

1713
02:21:53,380 --> 02:21:53,741
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1714
02:21:53,761 --> 02:21:53,881
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no.

1715
02:21:53,921 --> 02:21:54,561
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, well, shit.

1716
02:21:54,601 --> 02:21:55,201
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're including gas.

1717
02:21:55,221 --> 02:21:55,881
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, just the tickets?

1718
02:21:55,901 --> 02:21:56,521
[SPEAKER_02]: Just the tickets.

1719
02:21:56,541 --> 02:21:57,062
[SPEAKER_02]: Tickets alone.

1720
02:21:57,082 --> 02:21:57,062
60.

1721
02:21:58,022 --> 02:21:58,362
[SPEAKER_02]: Bingo.

1722
02:21:58,382 --> 02:21:58,362
$60.

1723
02:21:58,462 --> 02:21:59,322
[SPEAKER_29]: Because you said 20.

1724
02:21:59,682 --> 02:22:00,183
[SPEAKER_29]: I got that.

1725
02:22:00,203 --> 02:22:00,483
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, sorry.

1726
02:22:00,923 --> 02:22:01,783
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot you knew math.

1727
02:22:02,883 --> 02:22:03,884
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways.

1728
02:22:04,004 --> 02:22:11,646
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, fuck you to the Embassy Suites Hotel having their stupid... Okay, now their wireless...

1729
02:22:12,057 --> 02:22:16,100
[SPEAKER_02]: Internet there or whatever that was that I was trying to jump onto with my PSP.

1730
02:22:16,520 --> 02:22:19,742
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, you know, password free, but it wasn't letting me connect for some reason.

1731
02:22:19,782 --> 02:22:20,622
[SPEAKER_02]: That pissed me off.

1732
02:22:20,723 --> 02:22:22,083
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn those protected internets.

1733
02:22:22,103 --> 02:22:30,789
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I wanted to jump onto the chat room that was in the Live365 and write dirty stuff, but I couldn't do that, so that made me sad.

1734
02:22:32,870 --> 02:22:37,053
[SPEAKER_02]: And then fuck you to Oakland for sucking, for being really ghetto.

1735
02:22:37,713 --> 02:22:38,514
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate Oakland.

1736
02:22:39,544 --> 02:22:46,609
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, um, also, fuck you to Comcast for taking a week to fix my internet.

1737
02:22:47,729 --> 02:22:48,090
[SPEAKER_02]: You suck.

1738
02:22:48,530 --> 02:22:53,513
[SPEAKER_02]: But at least the guy that we got, that came out and fixed it, knew what was going on, so that's always good.

1739
02:22:53,533 --> 02:22:55,114
[SPEAKER_02]: You get one of those, like, every now and then.

1740
02:22:55,134 --> 02:22:56,715
[SPEAKER_02]: A Comcast employee knew what they were doing?

1741
02:22:57,175 --> 02:22:59,537
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, hey, you know they happen every now and then.

1742
02:23:00,578 --> 02:23:04,040
[SPEAKER_20]: I guess for, uh, it's chaos theory.

1743
02:23:04,060 --> 02:23:05,301
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, exactly.

1744
02:23:05,361 --> 02:23:05,881
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

1745
02:23:06,755 --> 02:23:08,956
[SPEAKER_02]: So, there are the few, the select few.

1746
02:23:09,216 --> 02:23:11,477
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we love Comcast, we really do.

1747
02:23:11,557 --> 02:23:13,258
[SPEAKER_02]: Please don't pull the plug, please don't pull the plug.

1748
02:23:15,218 --> 02:23:21,801
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and also, fuck you, Zach B., for just putting a picture of my leg.

1749
02:23:23,502 --> 02:23:25,102
[SPEAKER_08]: I can understand, okay.

1750
02:23:25,142 --> 02:23:26,903
[SPEAKER_08]: Be glad at least your leg got in there.

1751
02:23:26,943 --> 02:23:31,645
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a good shot, it was an action shot, but the next page they have a picture of Rob's face.

1752
02:23:32,485 --> 02:23:33,606
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, what about my face?

1753
02:23:34,196 --> 02:23:35,137
[SPEAKER_02]: No one knows what I look like.

1754
02:23:35,337 --> 02:23:36,498
[SPEAKER_02]: I am just a floating leg.

1755
02:23:36,738 --> 02:23:38,720
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's semi-transparent, mind you.

1756
02:23:38,740 --> 02:23:40,621
[SPEAKER_02]: That just goes to prove I'm sexier.

1757
02:23:42,143 --> 02:23:42,743
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just kidding.

1758
02:23:42,843 --> 02:23:43,784
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't... I'm sorry.

1759
02:23:43,804 --> 02:23:45,726
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you see the way I looked in that picture, though?

1760
02:23:45,806 --> 02:23:49,529
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm like... I don't know if it was just me or not, but he looked like a freaking Sasquatch.

1761
02:23:50,319 --> 02:23:53,202
[SPEAKER_22]: I swear, his eyebrows look... Yeah, Rob.

1762
02:23:53,602 --> 02:24:00,288
[SPEAKER_29]: No, it's just like, I don't know what it was, but your eyebrows looked especially white in the picture, so you look like... I had big, bushy eyebrows.

1763
02:24:00,448 --> 02:24:08,535
[SPEAKER_29]: You don't have... Okay, for anybody who hasn't seen Rob, which I'm pretty sure... Well, I'm on the camera right now, so it's dark as hell in here, so they can't see anything.

1764
02:24:08,555 --> 02:24:09,956
[SPEAKER_29]: Like, you don't have white eyebrows.

1765
02:24:10,586 --> 02:24:15,689
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't know what happened with that picture, but it looked like you seriously had no eyebrows, because they looked like they were shaving off and everything.

1766
02:24:15,709 --> 02:24:18,611
[SPEAKER_29]: Well, maybe they had to Photoshop me, because my hideous face!

1767
02:24:18,951 --> 02:24:22,833
[SPEAKER_29]: They're like, this guy's actually better looking than most radio personalities.

1768
02:24:22,853 --> 02:24:23,894
[SPEAKER_29]: We've got to make him look bad.

1769
02:24:28,136 --> 02:24:32,179
[SPEAKER_02]: Using crime technology, we're going to age him to look like Sasquatch.

1770
02:24:33,640 --> 02:24:34,280
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on.

1771
02:24:45,478 --> 02:24:49,660
[SPEAKER_02]: An F you to the fact that moving out took me like three weeks to do, but I'm very happy it's over now.

1772
02:24:49,680 --> 02:24:53,521
[SPEAKER_02]: An F you to the fact that we probably won't get the deposit back because landlords are cunts.

1773
02:24:53,901 --> 02:24:55,922
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, our old landlords are pretty decent.

1774
02:24:56,042 --> 02:24:56,782
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't knock them.

1775
02:24:56,822 --> 02:24:57,462
[SPEAKER_02]: They were decent.

1776
02:24:57,982 --> 02:25:00,303
[SPEAKER_02]: But we'll see if we get the deposit back or not.

1777
02:25:00,723 --> 02:25:04,064
[SPEAKER_02]: And I may be back here in three weeks saying that they are bitches, but we'll see.

1778
02:25:05,985 --> 02:25:07,806
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, F you to that.

1779
02:25:08,266 --> 02:25:13,308
[SPEAKER_02]: And F you to the fact that I really don't feel like I had a vacation, even though I've had three days off of work.

1780
02:25:13,328 --> 02:25:14,488
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've had like a five-day weekend.

1781
02:25:14,813 --> 02:25:16,214
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't feel like I had a vacation at all.

1782
02:25:17,195 --> 02:25:19,596
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm still tired, and I'm like, oh my god, I have to go to work tomorrow?

1783
02:25:19,616 --> 02:25:20,197
[SPEAKER_02]: Life sucks!

1784
02:25:20,557 --> 02:25:21,778
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate being a grown-up!

1785
02:25:21,918 --> 02:25:22,438
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate it!

1786
02:25:23,879 --> 02:25:26,801
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see what other people in our room have to say for the FUs of the week.

1787
02:25:26,821 --> 02:25:29,043
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll start it off with, uh, where are we gonna go?

1788
02:25:29,103 --> 02:25:29,483
[SPEAKER_02]: Arcadian42.

1789
02:25:29,563 --> 02:25:38,029
[SPEAKER_26]: Uh, fuck you to my computer being old and slow, and can't really afford a new one right now.

1790
02:25:38,669 --> 02:25:42,772
[SPEAKER_26]: Hopefully soon, but, you know, I put myself in more debt than I am right now.

1791
02:25:43,948 --> 02:25:47,291
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh well, and fuck you to the next week because it's going to be slow at work.

1792
02:25:47,811 --> 02:25:49,172
[SPEAKER_26]: I'll be bored half the time.

1793
02:25:50,513 --> 02:25:52,314
[SPEAKER_26]: And, eh, I get it.

1794
02:25:52,534 --> 02:25:53,095
[SPEAKER_26]: That's about it.

1795
02:25:56,497 --> 02:25:57,018
[SPEAKER_02]: Ice Queen.

1796
02:25:58,339 --> 02:25:59,159
[SPEAKER_22]: That's Princess Bitch.

1797
02:26:00,320 --> 02:26:01,861
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever, you're the biggest queen of them all.

1798
02:26:04,183 --> 02:26:04,683
[SPEAKER_25]: That's true.

1799
02:26:06,705 --> 02:26:07,045
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know.

1800
02:26:08,126 --> 02:26:09,647
[SPEAKER_22]: Sorry, somebody... Give the FUs.

1801
02:26:09,947 --> 02:26:11,068
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop screaming like a bitch.

1802
02:26:11,989 --> 02:26:12,189
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

1803
02:26:12,762 --> 02:26:20,007
[SPEAKER_22]: Fuck you to Toyotas for being pieces of shit and trying to rip me off for 900 freaking dollars and having to take my fucking three weeks in a row.

1804
02:26:20,467 --> 02:26:21,208
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, that too.

1805
02:26:23,750 --> 02:26:24,390
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, I had to.

1806
02:26:24,590 --> 02:26:27,152
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyway, so yeah, fuck you to that.

1807
02:26:27,192 --> 02:26:35,358
[SPEAKER_22]: Fuck you to people who write up facts on how to get rid of viruses and tell you to do shit that's going to fuck up your computer because I'm still waiting on having mine completely fixed.

1808
02:26:36,999 --> 02:26:40,221
[SPEAKER_22]: And fuck you to everybody who makes more money than me, which is just about everybody.

1809
02:26:40,582 --> 02:26:41,462
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, that's it.

1810
02:26:42,023 --> 02:26:42,223
[SPEAKER_02]: Angel.

1811
02:26:44,275 --> 02:26:47,557
[SPEAKER_19]: There are a few online classes because they're boring, but hey, whatever, I'm getting my shit done.

1812
02:26:47,697 --> 02:26:54,341
[SPEAKER_19]: So, um, yeah, and work is, okay, but work is work.

1813
02:26:54,701 --> 02:26:55,601
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, I will shut up now.

1814
02:26:55,641 --> 02:26:56,042
[SPEAKER_19]: Bye-bye.

1815
02:26:56,342 --> 02:26:57,642
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, BlankyStyle.

1816
02:27:00,044 --> 02:27:10,049
[SPEAKER_29]: Uh, just, uh, fuck you to people who don't take care of your cars, and you post them online saying, oh, there's nothing wrong with it, I swear, and then you totally sound like a dipshit on the phone who doesn't know what the fuck you're talking about.

1817
02:27:10,309 --> 02:27:12,691
[SPEAKER_29]: I guess that should be a big red flag and make me wonder, you know, why...

1818
02:27:13,803 --> 02:27:14,764
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah, okay.

1819
02:27:14,804 --> 02:27:15,785
[SPEAKER_29]: Rob, you're...

1820
02:27:41,272 --> 02:27:42,413
[SPEAKER_29]: You don't need to go there.

1821
02:27:42,493 --> 02:27:42,793
[SPEAKER_19]: Really?

1822
02:27:42,813 --> 02:27:45,274
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah, remember when you got those tires a little while back?

1823
02:27:45,414 --> 02:27:45,954
[SPEAKER_29]: Oh, shit.

1824
02:27:45,994 --> 02:27:48,575
[SPEAKER_29]: Remember how good that car ran after you got new tires on it?

1825
02:27:48,595 --> 02:27:51,016
[SPEAKER_29]: Maybe you should get some new ones now.

1826
02:27:51,056 --> 02:27:51,876
[SPEAKER_29]: Or get them rotated.

1827
02:27:52,557 --> 02:27:53,817
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to get your tires rotated?

1828
02:27:53,837 --> 02:27:56,118
[SPEAKER_29]: You should rotate them after so many miles.

1829
02:27:57,198 --> 02:28:00,320
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard once, like, I heard this rumor that some cars you have to put air in your tires.

1830
02:28:00,380 --> 02:28:00,760
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that true?

1831
02:28:01,929 --> 02:28:05,752
[SPEAKER_29]: Well, some of them actually have a totally solid center, like a cream fill.

1832
02:28:06,293 --> 02:28:07,193
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, like a Twinkie.

1833
02:28:07,234 --> 02:28:07,914
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah, like a Twinkie.

1834
02:28:07,974 --> 02:28:09,195
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think I have Twinkie tires.

1835
02:28:09,235 --> 02:28:10,997
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah, you won't need to fill those with air.

1836
02:28:11,017 --> 02:28:14,319
[SPEAKER_29]: Gosh, people.

1837
02:28:14,940 --> 02:28:15,881
[SPEAKER_02]: Mmm, Twinkie.

1838
02:28:16,802 --> 02:28:21,606
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, Twinkie tires would be the best invention ever, at least if, you know, your tire pulls a flat.

1839
02:28:21,946 --> 02:28:22,727
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah!

1840
02:28:22,827 --> 02:28:23,908
[SPEAKER_09]: Twinkie filling!

1841
02:28:24,568 --> 02:28:26,250
[SPEAKER_09]: Woohoo!

1842
02:28:26,390 --> 02:28:28,852
[SPEAKER_29]: Mmm, I'm full of Twinkie goodness.

1843
02:28:28,872 --> 02:28:30,233
[SPEAKER_29]: Mmm, this is a delicious flat.

1844
02:28:31,246 --> 02:28:40,468
[SPEAKER_29]: Now I just need to make a deep fryer big enough so I can fry them whenever I'm... It reminds me of that one Spamusement, which, by the way, is the best online comic of all time, Spamusement.

1845
02:28:40,528 --> 02:28:42,049
[SPEAKER_29]: Just hang up, don't listen to the show anymore.

1846
02:28:42,109 --> 02:28:44,029
[SPEAKER_02]: It says something about, are you man enough for this?

1847
02:28:44,509 --> 02:28:47,150
[SPEAKER_29]: And then it's like a deep-fried truck.

1848
02:28:47,170 --> 02:28:50,771
[SPEAKER_29]: What was it, like, I don't remember what it was, like, Dale Earnhardt Jr.

1849
02:28:50,851 --> 02:28:55,932
[SPEAKER_29]: on a flatbed with a fishing pole, deep-fried with country gravy.

1850
02:28:58,073 --> 02:28:59,533
[SPEAKER_29]: God, it was Spamusement.

1851
02:29:00,356 --> 02:29:03,377
[SPEAKER_02]: S-P-A-M-U-S-C Spamusement.

1852
02:29:03,537 --> 02:29:05,178
[SPEAKER_02]: Just take amusement and put SP on it.

1853
02:29:05,778 --> 02:29:06,058
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

1854
02:29:06,578 --> 02:29:07,458
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, moving on.

1855
02:29:08,579 --> 02:29:10,919
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, I have one more F you before we get to the chatroom F yous.

1856
02:29:11,459 --> 02:29:15,041
[SPEAKER_20]: Just back to the other thing I was saying before.

1857
02:29:16,061 --> 02:29:24,163
[SPEAKER_20]: For everybody who, and this actually goes a lot broader, for all of you people who bitch about the situation you're in, fucking make it change!

1858
02:29:24,584 --> 02:29:29,285
[SPEAKER_20]: You know who just do nothing but complain about it when there are ways to make it better?

1859
02:29:29,710 --> 02:29:37,093
[SPEAKER_20]: and then they don't do it because it's effort or it'll wreck the boat or stop bitching.

1860
02:29:38,174 --> 02:29:39,595
[SPEAKER_20]: Take control of your fucking life.

1861
02:29:40,575 --> 02:29:40,875
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm done.

1862
02:29:42,376 --> 02:29:44,697
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually forgot one more F you myself.

1863
02:29:45,217 --> 02:29:51,760
[SPEAKER_02]: F you to the fact that to go see The Lion King, it costs $75 to sit in the first tier.

1864
02:29:52,100 --> 02:29:57,983
[SPEAKER_02]: I was in the first balcony, $75 seats, and for that price, you would expect that there would be some nudity.

1865
02:29:58,860 --> 02:29:59,621
[SPEAKER_02]: and there was no nudity.

1866
02:29:59,641 --> 02:30:00,463
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoa, nudity where?

1867
02:30:00,723 --> 02:30:01,484
[SPEAKER_02]: In the Lion King.

1868
02:30:02,145 --> 02:30:03,327
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think that's gonna be it.

1869
02:30:04,389 --> 02:30:08,231
[SPEAKER_02]: Very upset at the lack of nudity in The Lion King, considering how much was paid to go see it.

1870
02:30:08,291 --> 02:30:10,853
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless it was, uh, what's his name, uh, the guy that did Hairspray?

1871
02:30:11,794 --> 02:30:13,374
[SPEAKER_30]: If you were to do The Lion King, yeah.

1872
02:30:13,555 --> 02:30:18,578
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, I realize that everybody brought their kids, and they were selling t-shirts that said Baby's First Musical and stuff.

1873
02:30:18,998 --> 02:30:19,858
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted nudity!

1874
02:30:19,999 --> 02:30:21,660
[SPEAKER_22]: Were you hoping for Simba's shaved balls?

1875
02:30:22,860 --> 02:30:23,621
[SPEAKER_02]: If nothing else.

1876
02:30:24,341 --> 02:30:26,903
[SPEAKER_02]: Or, you know, or Mufasa and whatever.

1877
02:30:27,023 --> 02:30:29,304
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to see Mufasa's Mufasa!

1878
02:30:29,344 --> 02:30:32,226
[SPEAKER_02]: Mufasa's like, it's time to make a baby.

1879
02:30:33,343 --> 02:30:34,244
[SPEAKER_02]: Roar!

1880
02:30:34,764 --> 02:30:35,344
[SPEAKER_13]: Roar!

1881
02:30:35,444 --> 02:30:37,466
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, Ice Queen, yeah, one last FU.

1882
02:30:39,267 --> 02:30:40,007
[SPEAKER_02]: No, yes, no.

1883
02:30:41,668 --> 02:30:47,011
[SPEAKER_22]: My last FU was to Effort, because I heard Jamie's FUs, and fuck Effort, screw that.

1884
02:30:47,111 --> 02:30:50,413
[SPEAKER_22]: I want to live and be rich and not have to move a freaking muscle.

1885
02:30:50,833 --> 02:30:53,715
[SPEAKER_22]: I want to win the lottery and be just a complete leech off society.

1886
02:30:53,735 --> 02:30:55,216
[SPEAKER_20]: You could be like that lady in Florida.

1887
02:30:55,236 --> 02:30:55,916
[SPEAKER_22]: That is my dream.

1888
02:30:56,577 --> 02:30:57,597
[SPEAKER_20]: But see, there's a difference.

1889
02:30:58,178 --> 02:30:59,399
[SPEAKER_20]: You're not complaining about it.

1890
02:30:59,459 --> 02:31:01,700
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm talking about to the people who say, I live...

1891
02:31:02,299 --> 02:31:03,620
[SPEAKER_22]: I was just not complaining.

1892
02:31:03,640 --> 02:31:07,283
[SPEAKER_02]: He doesn't call you at 9 o'clock at night.

1893
02:31:08,324 --> 02:31:09,565
[SPEAKER_30]: My life sucks.

1894
02:31:09,665 --> 02:31:10,406
[SPEAKER_30]: What did you do today?

1895
02:31:11,407 --> 02:31:11,867
[SPEAKER_30]: Nothing.

1896
02:31:11,907 --> 02:31:13,189
[SPEAKER_30]: I thought about paying a bill.

1897
02:31:14,690 --> 02:31:21,856
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm just talking about all the people who live with their parents and say, Oh, my parents don't respect me.

1898
02:31:22,256 --> 02:31:24,098
[SPEAKER_20]: And they make me do this.

1899
02:31:24,258 --> 02:31:24,618
[SPEAKER_18]: And they're 30.

1900
02:31:26,115 --> 02:31:30,039
[SPEAKER_02]: My parents bought me the old model SUV because they don't love me.

1901
02:31:30,099 --> 02:31:33,723
[SPEAKER_02]: My parents want me to stop whoring out and go back to junior high.

1902
02:31:35,044 --> 02:31:38,708
[SPEAKER_20]: My mommy yells at me, but I'm going to go out and buy an iPod.

1903
02:31:40,390 --> 02:31:41,832
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go to the chatroom, FU, shall we?

1904
02:31:43,033 --> 02:31:44,454
[SPEAKER_02]: Started off with Miklatov.

1905
02:31:44,695 --> 02:31:48,819
[SPEAKER_02]: Miklatov says, FU to not welcoming a cute boy's advances because I suck.

1906
02:31:49,861 --> 02:31:50,861
[SPEAKER_02]: F you to being sick all week.

1907
02:31:51,041 --> 02:31:52,962
[SPEAKER_02]: F you to E3 being too far away.

1908
02:31:53,062 --> 02:31:54,462
[SPEAKER_02]: And F you to general boredom.

1909
02:31:54,782 --> 02:31:58,863
[SPEAKER_22]: Miklatov, if you were here, I would not be shunning your advances, so you don't have to worry about that.

1910
02:31:59,363 --> 02:32:00,243
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, how nice are you.

1911
02:32:01,183 --> 02:32:03,904
[SPEAKER_02]: Illusion says F you to a boring weekend.

1912
02:32:03,944 --> 02:32:04,424
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

1913
02:32:04,524 --> 02:32:05,484
[SPEAKER_02]: Not angsty this week.

1914
02:32:05,644 --> 02:32:09,945
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and F you to About Schmidt for horribly depressing me by saying how significant life is.

1915
02:32:10,965 --> 02:32:13,186
[SPEAKER_02]: And F you to the Live365 Awards.

1916
02:32:13,526 --> 02:32:15,346
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys were O-L robbed.

1917
02:32:16,367 --> 02:32:16,647
[SPEAKER_02]: Get it?

1918
02:32:16,807 --> 02:32:17,307
[SPEAKER_02]: O-L-R.

1919
02:32:17,467 --> 02:32:17,967
[SPEAKER_02]: O-L robbed.

1920
02:32:18,107 --> 02:32:18,327
[SPEAKER_02]: Get it?

1921
02:32:22,299 --> 02:32:46,968
[SPEAKER_02]: Zaku says, F you to the drunk tards in another apartment in my apartment complex who thought that the place needed a more loud cowbell last night F you to having to work off the books to make a living and F you to having to put off finding a summer job till after finals when there probably won't be any good jobs left Jaded2005 says, F you to this guy who keeps calling me and waking me up

1922
02:32:49,198 --> 02:32:56,780
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkLionXVI says, F you to Spring Valley High School for suspending my cousin and his friend just because they were victims of a gang fight.

1923
02:32:57,460 --> 02:33:05,982
[SPEAKER_02]: My cousin's the one who got hit in the head with a hammer and his friend saved his life, yet they were suspended and were about to face expulsion.

1924
02:33:06,322 --> 02:33:09,203
[SPEAKER_02]: This is all over the local news and I hope they're embarrassed about it.

1925
02:33:09,943 --> 02:33:11,203
[SPEAKER_02]: Were they trying to reenact, like,

1926
02:33:11,710 --> 02:33:13,552
[SPEAKER_02]: Never mind, I don't want to go there.

1927
02:33:14,192 --> 02:33:19,636
[SPEAKER_02]: F you to WYN Las Vegas for being the most disappointing opening on the strip.

1928
02:33:20,037 --> 02:33:22,699
[SPEAKER_02]: Too many flowers on the inside and it's almost like the Bellagio.

1929
02:33:22,739 --> 02:33:24,881
[SPEAKER_02]: The only good thing about that place is the damn poker room.

1930
02:33:25,701 --> 02:33:30,505
[SPEAKER_02]: F you to KVVU Fox 5 Las Vegas for misspelling my cousin's last name.

02:33:32,507 --> 02:33:37,751
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkTetsuya says, F you to whatever was causing my loss of appetite about a week and a half ago.

1932
02:33:39,453 --> 02:33:41,054
[SPEAKER_02]: That would probably be Roseanne Naked.

1933
02:33:43,366 --> 02:33:43,867
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

1934
02:33:44,507 --> 02:33:46,707
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are kind of not angsty tonight.

1935
02:33:47,628 --> 02:33:49,048
[SPEAKER_20]: I thought I was plenty angsty.

1936
02:33:49,248 --> 02:33:53,109
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, no, you guys are plenty angsty, but I mean like the chat room.

1937
02:33:53,429 --> 02:33:55,129
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't vote and they weren't angsty.

1938
02:33:55,149 --> 02:33:55,870
[SPEAKER_02]: What's wrong with you guys?

1939
02:33:57,130 --> 02:33:59,731
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're background noise for a lot of people tonight.

1940
02:34:00,091 --> 02:34:01,771
[SPEAKER_20]: They're watching Family Guy.

1941
02:34:02,931 --> 02:34:03,252
[SPEAKER_20]: Damn them.

1942
02:34:03,272 --> 02:34:04,212
[SPEAKER_02]: We should just spoil it.

1943
02:34:04,572 --> 02:34:05,712
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we better not do that.

1944
02:34:05,752 --> 02:34:06,712
[SPEAKER_20]: Everybody dies.

1945
02:34:06,752 --> 02:34:07,633
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, everybody dies.

1946
02:34:07,833 --> 02:34:08,453
[SPEAKER_02]: The boat sinks.

1947
02:34:08,693 --> 02:34:08,933
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

1948
02:34:11,107 --> 02:34:12,907
[SPEAKER_02]: Peter and... Stewie's gay.

1949
02:34:16,948 --> 02:34:18,149
[SPEAKER_02]: Peter and Lois have sex.

1950
02:34:18,669 --> 02:34:19,369
[SPEAKER_02]: Multiple times.

1951
02:34:21,209 --> 02:34:22,550
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, we're going to go to a quick break.

1952
02:34:22,570 --> 02:34:26,271
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we're going to come back and do some Ask Orange Lounge.

1953
02:34:26,411 --> 02:34:30,052
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's been a little while since we've given you guys an opportunity to ask us questions.

1954
02:34:30,472 --> 02:34:32,172
[SPEAKER_02]: But we've been gone a couple weeks and we're back.

1955
02:34:32,572 --> 02:34:34,433
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're going to Ask Orange Lounge.

02:43:11,004 --> 02:43:15,586
[SPEAKER_02]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, and as promised, we're going to get into a little bit of Ask Orange Lounge.

1970
02:43:15,606 --> 02:43:22,010
[SPEAKER_02]: This is where you guys get to direct the future of the show by asking us questions about what you would like to hear us talk about.

1971
02:43:22,430 --> 02:43:23,851
[SPEAKER_02]: See, we're interactive like that.

1972
02:43:24,191 --> 02:43:27,133
[SPEAKER_02]: So, here we go with some Ask Orange Lounge.

1973
02:43:34,236 --> 02:43:37,218
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid questions.

1974
02:43:37,711 --> 02:43:40,892
[SPEAKER_02]: What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?

1975
02:43:41,392 --> 02:43:48,394
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be nice if I could concentrate, but the people in the kitchen are making so much goddamn noise that I can't think straight.

1976
02:43:53,956 --> 02:43:55,396
[SPEAKER_02]: Song number one.

1977
02:43:55,456 --> 02:43:56,536
[SPEAKER_02]: See, I can't think straight today.

1978
02:43:57,577 --> 02:43:59,577
[SPEAKER_02]: Jaded2005 with question number one.

1979
02:44:00,057 --> 02:44:03,558
[SPEAKER_02]: Me and my girlfriend have never seen you guys' faces.

1980
02:44:03,778 --> 02:44:05,499
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you guys look like?

1981
02:44:09,517 --> 02:44:11,638
[SPEAKER_02]: Folks from the kitchen saying they look like whores.

1982
02:44:11,759 --> 02:44:14,280
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the question wasn't about the folks in the kitchen, it's about us in here.

1983
02:44:14,601 --> 02:44:15,441
[SPEAKER_02]: What do we look like?

1984
02:44:17,162 --> 02:44:18,463
[SPEAKER_20]: We're damn sexy!

1985
02:44:18,483 --> 02:44:23,567
[SPEAKER_02]: There's pictures of us online?

1986
02:44:23,667 --> 02:44:36,916
[SPEAKER_02]: I look like Tom Cruise, and Matt looks like Matt Damon, and DarkSakura looks like Angelina Jolie, just like her.

1987
02:44:39,372 --> 02:44:41,693
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just, I'm making stuff up so that they, you know, can fantasize.

1988
02:44:41,713 --> 02:44:47,216
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, at least she doesn't look like a freaking toothpick, like Nicole Kidman's turned herself into, anorexic.

1989
02:44:48,456 --> 02:44:55,239
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, actually, if you guys want to see our pictures, we do have a picture gallery, if you're a registered user of OrangeOnTrader.com, and we don't spam you, there's no reason not to sign up.

1990
02:44:55,599 --> 02:44:59,581
[SPEAKER_02]: Just head on over, and you'll see the picture galleries, and you can actually see pictures of us at E3.

1991
02:44:59,921 --> 02:45:02,562
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's like plenty of pictures there, uh, from last year's E3.

1992
02:45:02,743 --> 02:45:08,045
[SPEAKER_02]: Even Jamie, who's typically camera shy, can be seen in those pictures, if you know where to look.

1993
02:45:09,204 --> 02:45:11,346
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, question number two from Illusion.

1994
02:45:11,846 --> 02:45:14,829
[SPEAKER_02]: Illusion would like to know, and perhaps Jamie you can answer this one for Illusion.

1995
02:45:15,289 --> 02:45:18,172
[SPEAKER_02]: Illusion would like to know, why do women have breasts?

1996
02:45:20,134 --> 02:45:23,497
[SPEAKER_20]: Genetically to provide sustenance for the child.

1997
02:45:25,618 --> 02:45:27,961
[SPEAKER_02]: And to bring home a paycheck at the end of the day.

1998
02:45:29,862 --> 02:45:30,343
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop.

1999
02:45:31,444 --> 02:45:33,305
[SPEAKER_02]: It's for feeding babies.

2000
02:45:34,006 --> 02:45:34,987
[SPEAKER_20]: It is for feeding babies.

2001
02:45:36,610 --> 02:45:39,051
[SPEAKER_30]: and old four year old men who pay enough.

2002
02:45:41,591 --> 02:45:42,271
[SPEAKER_19]: Just shut up.

2003
02:45:47,612 --> 02:45:51,553
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes kittens because I saw that once on a Japanese TV show.

2004
02:45:53,854 --> 02:45:54,154
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

2005
02:45:55,534 --> 02:45:56,114
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on.

2006
02:45:57,354 --> 02:45:58,955
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, they do say breast milk is best.

2007
02:45:59,155 --> 02:46:00,955
[SPEAKER_02]: Only on this show would somebody ask that question.

2008
02:46:01,015 --> 02:46:02,195
[SPEAKER_20]: Why do women have boobies?

2009
02:46:03,876 --> 02:46:04,556
[SPEAKER_02]: Ask your mama.

2010
02:46:04,596 --> 02:46:05,636
[SPEAKER_02]: Dear Orange Lounge,

2011
02:46:06,314 --> 02:46:07,035
[SPEAKER_02]: What's sex?

2012
02:46:08,377 --> 02:46:09,698
[SPEAKER_08]: Why do I have a pee-pee?

2013
02:46:12,662 --> 02:46:17,528
[SPEAKER_02]: Mikotov would like to know, what are you most looking forward to at E3 this year?

2014
02:46:19,972 --> 02:46:20,392
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, Loki.

2015
02:46:21,193 --> 02:46:21,654
[SPEAKER_02]: Sleeping.

2016
02:46:24,118 --> 02:46:25,238
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just going to sleep through E3?

2017
02:46:25,278 --> 02:46:26,659
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the plan?

2018
02:46:26,679 --> 02:46:30,041
[SPEAKER_02]: Sleeping after walking around during E3.

2019
02:46:30,121 --> 02:46:30,661
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I see.

2020
02:46:30,861 --> 02:46:32,202
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, you get tired.

2021
02:46:32,662 --> 02:46:37,164
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but what I want to see, I want to see Sinbad being ignored again.

2022
02:46:39,505 --> 02:46:41,446
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell the Sinbad story for those new listeners.

2023
02:46:42,227 --> 02:46:46,049
[SPEAKER_02]: We saw Sinbad at E3 last year, and he waved, and no one cared.

2024
02:46:46,069 --> 02:46:48,370
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone was just like, Who's that guy?

2025
02:46:48,410 --> 02:46:49,070
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's that guy?

2026
02:46:49,410 --> 02:46:49,991
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Sinbad.

2027
02:46:50,531 --> 02:46:50,611
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh.

2028
02:46:52,265 --> 02:46:52,986
[SPEAKER_02]: Poor guy.

2029
02:46:53,887 --> 02:46:55,989
[SPEAKER_02]: Say, look at me!

2030
02:46:56,510 --> 02:46:57,531
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi!

2031
02:46:57,551 --> 02:46:58,592
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi?

2032
02:46:58,612 --> 02:46:58,652
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi?

2033
02:47:01,615 --> 02:47:04,138
[SPEAKER_02]: Poor Sinbad.

2034
02:47:04,178 --> 02:47:10,065
[SPEAKER_02]: What I'm most looking forward to at E3 this year is the fact that there's going to be DDR with Mario.

2035
02:47:10,285 --> 02:47:12,087
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's going to be a fun game to check out.

2036
02:47:12,563 --> 02:47:17,530
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'm also looking forward to seeing what Nintendo turns out with the new Zelda and possibly a new console.

2037
02:47:17,591 --> 02:47:18,111
[SPEAKER_02]: Possibly.

2038
02:47:18,532 --> 02:47:22,518
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm looking forward to actually seeing progress on the Nintendo DS.

2039
02:47:22,818 --> 02:47:23,679
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking forward to that as well.

2040
02:47:24,941 --> 02:47:25,382
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.

2041
02:47:25,662 --> 02:47:27,445
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm looking forward to ogling over the Marines.

2042
02:47:28,851 --> 02:47:30,732
[SPEAKER_20]: There will be lots of men in uniform.

2043
02:47:31,772 --> 02:47:42,675
[SPEAKER_02]: I am expecting, I'm hoping this year with metrosexuality pushing more and more, as much as that word is stupid, pushing more and more into our culture, I'm looking for booth boys this year instead of booth babes.

2044
02:47:42,715 --> 02:47:43,776
[SPEAKER_02]: I want some booth boys this year.

2045
02:47:45,196 --> 02:47:46,456
[SPEAKER_02]: When I say boys, 18 and over, please.

2046
02:47:46,476 --> 02:47:49,577
[SPEAKER_02]: With the general demographic of being Nuri...

2047
02:47:52,858 --> 02:47:56,939
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, late 20s... That's starting to be more and more bullshit, though.

2048
02:47:57,079 --> 02:47:59,939
[SPEAKER_02]: Women are starting to play games more and more and more and more and more.

2049
02:48:00,200 --> 02:48:01,740
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's been a long time coming.

2050
02:48:02,080 --> 02:48:02,340
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

2051
02:48:02,720 --> 02:48:03,860
[SPEAKER_02]: Next thing you know, they'll want to vote.

2052
02:48:04,260 --> 02:48:09,721
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, honestly... This is your cue to tear into them.

2053
02:48:12,262 --> 02:48:12,802
[SPEAKER_20]: Repeat, please.

2054
02:48:14,322 --> 02:48:15,782
[SPEAKER_20]: I tend to ignore what he says.

2055
02:48:15,882 --> 02:48:16,982
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, allow me to repeat.

2056
02:48:17,223 --> 02:48:19,763
[SPEAKER_02]: He said, next thing you know, they'll want to vote.

2057
02:48:22,373 --> 02:48:23,974
[SPEAKER_02]: The ferrets haven't been unpacked yet, sorry.

2058
02:48:25,954 --> 02:48:35,196
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, in fact, actually, while you're at it, while you're at it, Illusion had the answer to his question from earlier, why do women have breasts?

2059
02:48:35,236 --> 02:48:40,658
[SPEAKER_02]: He sent another message that says, the correct answer was, so you got something to look at when you're talking to them.

2060
02:48:45,639 --> 02:48:46,299
[SPEAKER_18]: Where's the webcam?

2061
02:48:46,880 --> 02:48:48,540
[SPEAKER_02]: The webcam's over there, but it's very dark.

2062
02:48:50,128 --> 02:48:52,210
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm up here, not down there, now go away.

2063
02:48:54,151 --> 02:48:55,892
[SPEAKER_18]: That's it, mastectomy.

2064
02:48:58,193 --> 02:49:02,596
[SPEAKER_02]: And some women aren't just not up here and not down there, they're down a little bit lower.

2065
02:49:03,956 --> 02:49:04,337
[SPEAKER_02]: Like grandma?

2066
02:49:04,357 --> 02:49:05,377
[SPEAKER_20]: Those are people in their 60s.

2067
02:49:07,419 --> 02:49:07,799
[SPEAKER_02]: Saggy.

2068
02:49:07,939 --> 02:49:08,999
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't look at grandma's breasts.

2069
02:49:09,019 --> 02:49:11,041
[SPEAKER_20]: That is the result of bra burning in the 70s.

2070
02:49:13,280 --> 02:49:14,741
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, yeah.

2071
02:49:14,781 --> 02:49:16,082
[SPEAKER_02]: What was the point of that?

2072
02:49:16,423 --> 02:49:17,023
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, honestly.

2073
02:49:17,043 --> 02:49:19,425
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not going to be considered by bras.

2074
02:49:20,706 --> 02:49:21,687
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yay.

2075
02:49:22,308 --> 02:49:28,193
[SPEAKER_20]: Because they saw that as a symbol of, you know, men keeping their fit on women.

2076
02:49:28,213 --> 02:49:32,576
[SPEAKER_20]: But the whole thing, bras are there to support your boobs so you're not saggy.

2077
02:49:33,077 --> 02:49:34,818
[SPEAKER_02]: I know some men that like to wear bras.

2078
02:49:35,379 --> 02:49:36,099
[SPEAKER_20]: They're like, they're like.

2079
02:49:36,119 --> 02:49:37,761
[SPEAKER_20]: Because they got tits.

2080
02:49:39,389 --> 02:49:40,611
[SPEAKER_02]: They won't hold us back!

2081
02:49:40,711 --> 02:49:42,273
[SPEAKER_02]: Now spray us with that hose!

2082
02:49:42,494 --> 02:49:42,614
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh.

2083
02:49:46,620 --> 02:49:47,081
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways.

2084
02:49:47,722 --> 02:49:50,326
[SPEAKER_02]: I gotta play the sexist role on this show.

2085
02:49:50,346 --> 02:49:50,446
[SPEAKER_02]: It's

2086
02:49:52,486 --> 02:49:56,207
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, right, all right, the role, the role that you fit into.

2087
02:49:56,267 --> 02:50:10,131
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, honestly, I've been talking to, you know, my fiancée, and she says that women are not bad drivers, but every time I see a goddamn, you know, crazy bitch on the road, it's always some stupid woman on her cell phone driving an SUV.

2088
02:50:10,512 --> 02:50:13,072
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't help it if they keep perpetuating the stereotype.

2089
02:50:13,672 --> 02:50:15,113
[SPEAKER_20]: I got stuck behind...

2090
02:50:15,934 --> 02:50:18,938
[SPEAKER_20]: An old man driving an SUV talking on his cell phone.

2091
02:50:18,978 --> 02:50:19,438
[SPEAKER_20]: Exactly.

2092
02:50:19,678 --> 02:50:21,701
[SPEAKER_20]: They fall into the old people category.

2093
02:50:21,941 --> 02:50:23,102
[SPEAKER_02]: Was he burning his bra?

2094
02:50:23,323 --> 02:50:25,685
[SPEAKER_20]: He was burning his pampers.

2095
02:50:25,705 --> 02:50:26,927
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know.

2096
02:50:27,267 --> 02:50:29,089
[SPEAKER_20]: Whatever it is the old men wear depends.

2097
02:50:30,791 --> 02:50:31,592
[SPEAKER_02]: Old men are nasty.

2098
02:50:33,063 --> 02:50:39,145
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, my new roommate is looking in on the room right now, kind of going, what the hell are these people doing right now?

2099
02:50:39,765 --> 02:50:40,685
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we interview you, please?

2100
02:50:41,105 --> 02:50:44,066
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't you agree women suck at driving?

2101
02:50:45,586 --> 02:50:46,427
[SPEAKER_02]: This is my new roommate.

2102
02:50:46,447 --> 02:50:46,787
[SPEAKER_02]: Say hello.

2103
02:50:46,927 --> 02:50:47,627
[SPEAKER_21]: Hello.

2104
02:50:47,927 --> 02:50:50,828
[SPEAKER_02]: How much DDR do you play?

2105
02:50:50,868 --> 02:50:51,888
[SPEAKER_02]: How familiar are you with DDR?

2106
02:50:52,686 --> 02:50:56,669
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, well, I just, like, played the game that my sister bought.

2107
02:50:57,130 --> 02:51:01,253
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is DDR Extreme on PS2.

2108
02:51:01,433 --> 02:51:02,033
[SPEAKER_21]: And it was fun.

2109
02:51:02,994 --> 02:51:06,317
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think about the fact that your roommate does this crazy internet radio program?

2110
02:51:06,777 --> 02:51:12,341
[SPEAKER_21]: It's craziness with a capital K. Um, no, I think it's cool.

2111
02:51:13,482 --> 02:51:15,483
[SPEAKER_21]: This is the first time I've seen you do it, so it's cool.

2112
02:51:15,704 --> 02:51:16,684
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we nerds or what?

2113
02:51:17,325 --> 02:51:17,365
[SPEAKER_21]: Um...

2114
02:51:17,873 --> 02:51:18,874
[SPEAKER_21]: You're a crazy nerd.

2115
02:51:18,914 --> 02:51:22,456
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that you're entertaining the guests out in the kitchen who have long since abandoned the show.

2116
02:51:23,096 --> 02:51:23,897
[SPEAKER_21]: That's cool, yeah.

2117
02:51:23,937 --> 02:51:24,877
[SPEAKER_02]: Now tell them to keep it down out there.

2118
02:51:24,897 --> 02:51:25,698
[SPEAKER_02]: We're trying to do a show in here.

2119
02:51:25,898 --> 02:51:26,538
[SPEAKER_21]: Keep it down.

2120
02:51:26,658 --> 02:51:28,319
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, okay, I'll go that way.

2121
02:51:28,699 --> 02:51:28,920
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoa.

2122
02:51:29,540 --> 02:51:30,320
[SPEAKER_02]: What the hell was that noise?

2123
02:51:31,521 --> 02:51:31,881
[SPEAKER_02]: That was weird.

2124
02:51:31,921 --> 02:51:32,582
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, sorry.

2125
02:51:32,702 --> 02:51:33,482
[SPEAKER_02]: It must be interference.

2126
02:51:34,603 --> 02:51:35,163
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoa, okay.

2127
02:51:36,064 --> 02:51:36,384
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

2128
02:51:36,564 --> 02:51:37,064
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well.

2129
02:51:37,304 --> 02:51:38,465
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, well, nice seeing you.

2130
02:51:38,485 --> 02:51:38,705
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

2131
02:51:39,386 --> 02:51:40,767
[SPEAKER_02]: Get out of the room that you pay rent for.

2132
02:51:40,787 --> 02:51:41,367
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm just kidding.

2133
02:51:42,347 --> 02:51:43,088
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but honestly.

2134
02:51:45,051 --> 02:51:50,112
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, like I said, there are the slight few, just like good Comcast cable, you know.

2135
02:51:50,372 --> 02:51:51,172
[SPEAKER_20]: I drive well.

2136
02:51:51,712 --> 02:51:52,852
[SPEAKER_20]: I said the slight few.

2137
02:51:53,052 --> 02:51:56,113
[SPEAKER_20]: People don't pull out in front of me in their taxi van.

2138
02:51:56,273 --> 02:51:56,993
[SPEAKER_19]: Exactly.

2139
02:51:57,213 --> 02:51:58,233
[SPEAKER_20]: I beeped at this guy.

2140
02:51:58,553 --> 02:52:05,475
[SPEAKER_20]: I was like, beep, beep, and I ended up having to swerve into the other lane, and then I slid because of the freaking, you know, rain.

2141
02:52:05,575 --> 02:52:07,675
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, everyone knows that taxi drivers suck.

2142
02:52:07,695 --> 02:52:08,915
[SPEAKER_02]: I've actually wanted to do that.

2143
02:52:08,975 --> 02:52:13,156
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead of actually honking my horn, rolling down the window, and sticking my head out and yelling, beep, beep.

2144
02:52:13,616 --> 02:52:15,237
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I think people would notice me more then.

2145
02:52:15,437 --> 02:52:17,999
[SPEAKER_02]: As you hit something and your head gets taken off.

2146
02:52:18,259 --> 02:52:19,640
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, you sucker!

2147
02:52:20,060 --> 02:52:21,541
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm about to run into your ass!

2148
02:52:21,602 --> 02:52:23,703
[SPEAKER_08]: Extend your left arm out.

2149
02:52:24,604 --> 02:52:26,365
[SPEAKER_08]: Extend your middle finger up.

2150
02:52:29,527 --> 02:52:32,069
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, we totally sidestepped whatever that question was.

2151
02:52:32,269 --> 02:52:34,130
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm going to post pictures of my car in the chatroom.

2152
02:52:34,410 --> 02:52:35,351
[SPEAKER_02]: Ninst has a question.

2153
02:52:36,351 --> 02:52:38,393
[SPEAKER_02]: Ninst says he's kind of stretching for a question here.

2154
02:52:38,453 --> 02:52:39,534
[SPEAKER_02]: Skip it if you've got a better one.

2155
02:52:39,574 --> 02:52:40,034
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we don't.

2156
02:52:41,011 --> 02:52:45,537
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to be getting another 2DX game soon, so 7th style or 8th style?

2157
02:52:47,140 --> 02:52:47,220
[SPEAKER_02]: 8th.

2158
02:52:47,240 --> 02:52:49,122
[SPEAKER_02]: 8th.

2159
02:52:49,262 --> 02:52:49,863
[SPEAKER_02]: I say 7th.

2160
02:52:51,265 --> 02:52:57,654
[SPEAKER_19]: That's actually a toss-up because I like what's on 7th, but I really like what's on 8th, so... Get 6th.

2161
02:52:57,674 --> 02:52:57,734
[SPEAKER_02]: 8th.

2162
02:53:00,478 --> 02:53:01,098
[SPEAKER_02]: I like Seventh.

2163
02:53:01,278 --> 02:53:02,519
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to be the lone hold-up for Seventh.

2164
02:53:02,539 --> 02:53:05,740
[SPEAKER_02]: Although, honestly, in Eighth Style, you get a lot of the good Seventh Style songs.

2165
02:53:05,820 --> 02:53:10,722
[SPEAKER_02]: But, but, but, but, Beauty of Silence, Sound of Goodbye, but, but, but, you know, that's just me.

2166
02:53:12,462 --> 02:53:13,322
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't play 2DX.

2167
02:53:15,743 --> 02:53:18,384
[SPEAKER_02]: Lastly, a question, because we didn't get any more than this.

2168
02:53:18,444 --> 02:53:19,705
[SPEAKER_02]: Legend of Zaku has this.

2169
02:53:19,765 --> 02:53:20,665
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, this is beautiful.

2170
02:53:21,305 --> 02:53:28,748
[SPEAKER_02]: After stumbling through the Errand in Japan forums, I managed to find a thread that has what appears to be a link for a DDR movie in production.

2171
02:53:30,111 --> 02:53:33,453
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the link of the story since the main site is down and then he gave a link here.

2172
02:53:33,893 --> 02:53:36,375
[SPEAKER_02]: What chances do you give this so-called movie in the works?

2173
02:53:36,415 --> 02:53:38,036
[SPEAKER_02]: So I looked at the link he gave and here it is.

2174
02:53:39,037 --> 02:53:43,419
[SPEAKER_02]: Dance Dance Revolution is the name of the popular video game created by the well-known game company Konami.

2175
02:53:43,840 --> 02:53:47,622
[SPEAKER_02]: The current team consists... Okay, right there, you know it's a fake.

2176
02:53:48,262 --> 02:53:48,883
[SPEAKER_02]: You can tell, right?

2177
02:53:48,923 --> 02:53:50,844
[SPEAKER_02]: What is wrong with the first sentence that makes this a fake?

2178
02:53:52,545 --> 02:53:52,965
[SPEAKER_02]: Konami.

2179
02:53:54,146 --> 02:53:54,866
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not Konami.

2180
02:53:54,886 --> 02:53:55,207
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

2181
02:53:55,747 --> 02:53:55,867
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

2182
02:53:56,855 --> 02:53:58,517
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, well-known game company, Konami.

2183
02:53:58,797 --> 02:54:00,378
[SPEAKER_02]: Konami does much more than just video games.

2184
02:54:00,819 --> 02:54:01,920
[SPEAKER_02]: Much, much more than just video games.

2185
02:54:02,300 --> 02:54:02,600
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember?

2186
02:54:02,760 --> 02:54:03,841
[SPEAKER_02]: They create slot machines.

2187
02:54:04,061 --> 02:54:06,644
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, yeah, but primarily they're known for the video games.

2188
02:54:06,664 --> 02:54:09,246
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm saying, if this were an official press release, that wouldn't say that.

2189
02:54:09,847 --> 02:54:10,267
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think.

2190
02:54:10,647 --> 02:54:12,049
[SPEAKER_02]: It would say something like game publishers.

2191
02:54:12,249 --> 02:54:13,590
[SPEAKER_02]: Either that or these people are just stupid.

2192
02:54:14,070 --> 02:54:17,774
[SPEAKER_02]: The current team consists of two members so far, and I'm not even going to read their names.

2193
02:54:18,334 --> 02:54:19,275
[SPEAKER_02]: Creator and directors.

2194
02:54:19,355 --> 02:54:20,236
[SPEAKER_02]: Two guys I've never heard of.

2195
02:54:20,816 --> 02:54:22,978
[SPEAKER_02]: We started Dance Dance Revolution the movie in 2005.

2196
02:54:24,858 --> 02:54:26,580
[SPEAKER_02]: Alrighty then, time for the storyline.

2197
02:54:26,600 --> 02:54:30,683
[SPEAKER_02]: 18-year-old Emi Toshiba's lifelong dream was to become a professional dancer.

2198
02:54:31,264 --> 02:54:34,527
[SPEAKER_02]: One day, she sees a flyer on a liquor store's window announcing a dance contest.

2199
02:54:34,627 --> 02:54:39,251
[SPEAKER_02]: As she runs for the big-time winner with her partner, Rage, they meet some new friends, rivals, and conflicts.

2200
02:54:39,411 --> 02:54:45,916
[SPEAKER_02]: As Emi is settling into her new surroundings, she and her new friends gradually become aware that not all is quite right in the contest.

2201
02:54:46,217 --> 02:54:49,760
[SPEAKER_02]: Something sinister is lurking deep in the shadows of the dancing stage.

2202
02:54:50,575 --> 02:54:53,496
[SPEAKER_02]: The movie is all about competition, love, and accepting others as they are.

2203
02:54:53,536 --> 02:54:56,097
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you like drama, comedy, and DDR, this is the movie for you!

2204
02:54:57,237 --> 02:55:03,019
[SPEAKER_02]: The plans, we're going to produce the movie in 2007 or 2008, depending on when we'll get enough money for the production.

2205
02:55:03,479 --> 02:55:05,819
[SPEAKER_02]: Depending on when we graduate from college.

2206
02:55:07,620 --> 02:55:08,640
[SPEAKER_20]: You know what, it's not going to happen.

2207
02:55:08,660 --> 02:55:10,801
[SPEAKER_20]: That's like a plot of maybe an anime for it.

2208
02:55:12,719 --> 02:55:15,299
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like Emmy of Rage Liquor Store.

2209
02:55:15,860 --> 02:55:16,740
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god!

2210
02:55:17,060 --> 02:55:18,360
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to be dancer!

2211
02:55:18,580 --> 02:55:23,821
[SPEAKER_02]: Emmy, by the way, is going to be played by a big-breasted Asian chick in order to sell tickets.

2212
02:55:23,881 --> 02:55:24,381
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll watch it.

2213
02:55:26,141 --> 02:55:28,102
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, I don't care what it's about.

2214
02:55:28,162 --> 02:55:35,283
[SPEAKER_02]: You can just get that chick from BMX XXX, the one that strips down naked and is dressed up like a schoolgirl.

2215
02:55:35,763 --> 02:55:37,163
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll get me to see that movie.

2216
02:55:37,743 --> 02:55:41,284
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all you need to show is her dressed up like a schoolgirl stripping down naked.

2217
02:55:42,469 --> 02:55:44,933
[SPEAKER_02]: In the trailer, that will sell tickets.

2218
02:55:45,594 --> 02:55:47,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell, they should just make BMX XXX the movie.

2219
02:55:48,057 --> 02:55:48,638
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be better.

2220
02:55:50,320 --> 02:55:53,484
[SPEAKER_02]: Every six months, the topic of DDR the movie is coming up.

2221
02:55:54,906 --> 02:55:56,589
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop believing it!

2222
02:55:57,370 --> 02:55:58,951
[SPEAKER_02]: There's only one way this will happen.

2223
02:55:59,051 --> 02:56:09,896
[SPEAKER_02]: Until it is posted on IMDB or announced by a reputable has a reputation, right?

2224
02:56:10,357 --> 02:56:12,678
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the big five movie production companies.

2225
02:56:12,698 --> 02:56:13,558
[SPEAKER_02]: You know who's going to do this?

2226
02:56:13,598 --> 02:56:16,060
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if it's Lionsgate, wait for them to announce it.

2227
02:56:16,120 --> 02:56:16,800
[SPEAKER_02]: You know who's going to?

2228
02:56:17,080 --> 02:56:18,341
[SPEAKER_02]: Now Lionsgate's not all bad.

2229
02:56:18,361 --> 02:56:18,961
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, I know.

2230
02:56:18,981 --> 02:56:19,801
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't be knocking Lionsgate.

2231
02:56:19,821 --> 02:56:20,862
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to knock Lionsgate.

2232
02:56:20,882 --> 02:56:32,087
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just going to say, you know who would stoop this low, Uyval?

2233
02:56:32,507 --> 02:56:38,290
[SPEAKER_02]: He would do this because he's like, ooh, an excuse to have another rave on an island.

2234
02:56:41,308 --> 02:56:41,328
[SPEAKER_19]: 10K...

2235
02:56:52,956 --> 02:56:55,357
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, God, don't start on that again.

2236
02:56:55,397 --> 02:56:56,997
[SPEAKER_02]: That's another fanboy thing, though.

2237
02:56:57,037 --> 02:57:00,178
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, with all due respect to the folks that created it, come on.

2238
02:57:00,358 --> 02:57:01,178
[SPEAKER_02]: But here's the thing, though.

2239
02:57:01,658 --> 02:57:02,938
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the only way that it would work.

2240
02:57:03,458 --> 02:57:06,159
[SPEAKER_02]: And the whole focus of it's not really on DDR.

2241
02:57:06,179 --> 02:57:09,760
[SPEAKER_02]: They play DDR in it, but that's not really the focus of it.

2242
02:57:10,120 --> 02:57:12,740
[SPEAKER_02]: But I like the setup that they do for the tournament.

2243
02:57:12,760 --> 02:57:14,361
[SPEAKER_02]: The tournament setup was kind of cool.

2244
02:57:14,781 --> 02:57:15,961
[SPEAKER_02]: It made it look cool.

2245
02:57:16,141 --> 02:57:18,062
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the only way that it would work.

2246
02:57:18,582 --> 02:57:19,262
[SPEAKER_02]: None of this, like...

2247
02:57:19,858 --> 02:57:20,679
[SPEAKER_02]: Bloodsport DDR Edition

2248
02:57:46,624 --> 02:57:49,385
[SPEAKER_02]: I think now would be a good time to end Ask Orange Lounge.

2249
02:57:49,405 --> 02:57:50,085
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you guys think?

2250
02:57:51,145 --> 02:57:52,186
[SPEAKER_02]: I think not.

2251
02:57:53,426 --> 02:57:56,207
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I'm being linked to something in the chatroom.

2252
02:57:56,247 --> 02:57:58,268
[SPEAKER_02]: It is something that's on Internet Movie Database.

2253
02:57:59,448 --> 02:58:01,289
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, I think this is what I think it is.

2254
02:58:01,889 --> 02:58:03,189
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on, I'm trying to load the link right now.

2255
02:58:03,770 --> 02:58:05,050
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in the chatroom.

2256
02:58:05,070 --> 02:58:06,911
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Dance Dance Documentary.

2257
02:58:09,291 --> 02:58:09,651
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

2258
02:58:09,691 --> 02:58:13,073
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something that folks... What is this?

2259
02:58:13,553 --> 02:58:14,213
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a DVD...

2260
02:58:15,947 --> 02:58:16,848
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a documentary.

2261
02:58:18,689 --> 02:58:19,329
[SPEAKER_02]: Eh, big deal.

2262
02:58:19,550 --> 02:58:20,250
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, no offense.

2263
02:58:20,710 --> 02:58:21,911
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I was in one of these.

2264
02:58:22,091 --> 02:58:23,392
[SPEAKER_02]: I got interviewed for one of these.

2265
02:58:23,412 --> 02:58:27,976
[SPEAKER_02]: They wanted me to wear the Dr. Dick hat, the orange hat, and I wouldn't do it because I knew it was being made for a movie.

2266
02:58:28,696 --> 02:58:31,698
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if that's the one or if it was some other college project or something.

2267
02:58:31,718 --> 02:58:33,079
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was a college project.

2268
02:58:33,100 --> 02:58:33,620
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know.

2269
02:58:35,171 --> 02:58:36,352
[SPEAKER_02]: This isn't the same thing.

2270
02:58:36,432 --> 02:58:37,833
[SPEAKER_02]: Documentaries are one thing.

2271
02:58:37,893 --> 02:58:41,276
[SPEAKER_02]: Documentaries, you know, a lot of people unfortunately don't see.

2272
02:58:41,336 --> 02:58:48,121
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot of projects that, you know, I'm sure they're fine films, but, you know, we're talking about like a fiction type thing.

2273
02:58:48,161 --> 02:58:50,122
[SPEAKER_02]: Big budget, basically, movie here.

2274
02:58:50,763 --> 02:58:52,144
[SPEAKER_02]: Even a million dollars could be a big budget.

2275
02:58:52,164 --> 02:58:56,467
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think anyone's going to actually be... See, here's the problem with this whole movie idea.

2276
02:58:57,288 --> 02:59:01,691
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe like, you know, a fan movie, possibly...

2277
02:59:02,578 --> 02:59:03,519
[SPEAKER_02]: Big budget movie?

2278
02:59:03,739 --> 02:59:03,899
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

2279
02:59:03,979 --> 02:59:12,905
[SPEAKER_02]: Because even if DDR is uber popular, it doesn't lend itself to a movie at all, and you can't make a movie.

2280
02:59:12,945 --> 02:59:17,268
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like Tetris the movie, and I know everyone likes joking about that.

2281
02:59:17,688 --> 02:59:18,449
[SPEAKER_02]: It's impossible.

2282
02:59:19,289 --> 02:59:26,054
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to make a movie where DDR is an element, but not the main force behind it.

2283
02:59:26,774 --> 02:59:30,317
[SPEAKER_02]: You could do a buddy movie that somehow has DDR.

2284
02:59:30,337 --> 02:59:31,297
[SPEAKER_02]: They like to play DDR.

2285
02:59:32,489 --> 02:59:33,270
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's an example.

2286
02:59:33,892 --> 02:59:34,412
[SPEAKER_02]: The Wizard.

2287
02:59:36,075 --> 02:59:36,917
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not Nintendo.

2288
02:59:36,957 --> 02:59:37,999
[SPEAKER_02]: The Wizard was gay.

2289
02:59:38,159 --> 02:59:39,962
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, that's not... Hey!

2290
02:59:40,142 --> 02:59:42,206
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, now that movie was good in the 80s.

2291
02:59:43,911 --> 02:59:44,672
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so bad.

2292
02:59:44,852 --> 02:59:45,892
[SPEAKER_02]: It did have Christian Slater.

2293
02:59:46,153 --> 02:59:46,433
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay?

2294
02:59:46,573 --> 02:59:54,598
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, granted, now, that's the only way that this type of thing would work, is where it's like an element of it, you know, but that's not the main storyline.

2295
02:59:54,658 --> 02:59:58,241
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's not just, oh, look at us, we're playing DDR all the time.

2296
02:59:58,401 --> 03:00:03,984
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, like the Wizard, they had some more crap, like the stupid kid, like, California!

2297
03:00:04,725 --> 03:00:05,385
[SPEAKER_02]: I hated him.

2298
03:00:07,246 --> 03:00:08,527
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, something like that.

2299
03:00:08,567 --> 03:00:09,488
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they had the Power Glove.

2300
03:00:10,429 --> 03:00:10,729
[SPEAKER_02]: So bad.

2301
03:00:10,749 --> 03:00:11,009
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

2302
03:00:12,809 --> 03:00:16,713
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the end of another fabulous episode of Orange Lounge Radio, boys and girls.

2303
03:00:16,753 --> 03:00:19,815
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts, starting with Angel.

2304
03:00:21,056 --> 03:00:21,817
[SPEAKER_02]: Angel, your final thought.

2305
03:00:23,538 --> 03:00:25,099
[SPEAKER_19]: I've been too quiet this episode.

2306
03:00:25,139 --> 03:00:25,600
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm sorry.

2307
03:00:26,420 --> 03:00:26,981
[SPEAKER_02]: That's okay.

2308
03:00:27,501 --> 03:00:28,922
[SPEAKER_02]: Arcadian42, your final thought.

2309
03:00:30,584 --> 03:00:33,086
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna... Loki, your final thought.

2310
03:00:34,126 --> 03:00:36,268
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sexist or racist.

2311
03:00:36,348 --> 03:00:37,529
[SPEAKER_02]: I just play one on the radio.

2312
03:00:38,950 --> 03:00:40,151
[SPEAKER_02]: My final thought is...

2313
03:00:43,615 --> 03:00:47,617
[SPEAKER_20]: That does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live.

2314
03:00:47,637 --> 03:00:51,460
[SPEAKER_20]: Orange Lounge Radio Live is an Orange Lounge Radio production.

2317
03:03:14,194 --> 03:03:16,056
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for watching!

2318
03:03:29,161 --> 03:03:30,042
[SPEAKER_24]: That was wonderful.

2319
03:03:30,062 --> 03:03:30,682
[SPEAKER_24]: Bravo.

2320
03:03:30,863 --> 03:03:31,403
[SPEAKER_24]: I loved that.

2321
03:03:31,423 --> 03:03:32,084
[SPEAKER_24]: That was great.

2322
03:03:32,224 --> 03:03:33,105
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, it was pretty good.

2323
03:03:33,205 --> 03:03:34,226
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, it wasn't bad.

2324
03:03:34,346 --> 03:03:35,967
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, there were parts of it that weren't very good, though.

2325
03:03:35,987 --> 03:03:36,808
[SPEAKER_24]: It could have been a lot better.

2326
03:03:37,008 --> 03:03:37,889
[SPEAKER_24]: I didn't really like it.

2327
03:03:37,969 --> 03:03:38,930
[SPEAKER_24]: It was pretty terrible.

2328
03:03:38,990 --> 03:03:39,610
[SPEAKER_24]: It was bad.

2329
03:03:39,691 --> 03:03:40,291
[SPEAKER_24]: It was awful.

2330
03:03:40,311 --> 03:03:41,292
[SPEAKER_24]: It was terrible.

2331
03:03:41,312 --> 03:03:41,933
[SPEAKER_24]: Get him away.

2332
03:03:41,973 --> 03:03:42,493
[SPEAKER_24]: Hey, boo.

2333
03:03:42,533 --> 03:03:43,014
[SPEAKER_24]: Boo.

2334
03:03:44,375 --> 03:03:47,838
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.

2335
03:04:01,804 --> 03:04:05,648
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, after that one, I think we know that we definitely need to rotate the FU music.

2336
03:04:06,629 --> 03:04:07,550
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to be great.

2337
03:04:08,471 --> 03:04:13,936
[SPEAKER_02]: I will work my butt off to get the new intro done, but first, the playlist shuffle is happening tomorrow.

2338
03:04:14,156 --> 03:04:15,457
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got to get that done.

2339
03:04:15,517 --> 03:04:17,359
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll hopefully get it done tonight after the show.

2340
03:04:17,539 --> 03:04:18,220
[SPEAKER_02]: But not for that.

2341
03:04:18,821 --> 03:04:19,021
[SPEAKER_14]: But...

2342
03:04:19,778 --> 03:04:20,579
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm working on that.

2343
03:04:21,240 --> 03:04:26,044
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Lounge Radio is going to change and stuff, and we were serious, so it's going to happen.

2344
03:04:26,064 --> 03:04:27,225
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully the website soon, too.

2345
03:04:27,265 --> 03:04:28,266
[SPEAKER_02]: I just need new graphics.

2346
03:04:28,827 --> 03:04:30,108
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm working on it.

2347
03:04:30,589 --> 03:04:32,631
[SPEAKER_08]: I just can't think.

2348
03:04:32,731 --> 03:04:33,592
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to.

2349
03:04:35,013 --> 03:04:35,954
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm in school!

2350
03:04:39,377 --> 03:04:43,582
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, boys and girls, thanks a bunch for tuning in tonight and listening to and supporting Orange Lounge Radio.

2351
03:04:43,622 --> 03:04:43,982
[SPEAKER_02]: We love
