00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,640
Orange Islands Radio Live episode 140 is coming to you right after this song from Distance

3
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:45,640
sounds time after time.

4
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:23,640
You're all it to me, call it it to me

5
00:01:53,640 --> 00:02:00,640
Flash back, warm nights, almost left behind

6
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,640
Single piece of memory

7
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,640
Time after sometimes you picked me

8
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:16,640
I'm walking too far ahead, you're calling to me

9
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:22,640
I can't hear what you said, can you see

10
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:28,640
Go slow, and I fall behind

11
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,640
And a second hand unwinds if lost

12
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:35,640
You can look and you will find it

13
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,640
And I love the time

14
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,640
If you fall I will catch you

15
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,640
I'll be with you

16
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,640
Time after time

17
00:02:53,640 --> 00:03:00,640
After my picture phase and darkness has turned to grey

18
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:07,640
Watching through windows, you're wondering if I'm okay

19
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:15,640
Secrets stolen, deep inside, ape inside

20
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:18,640
The drum beats out of time

21
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:25,640
Plus you can run and you will find it, time after time

22
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:32,640
If you fall I will catch you, I'll be with you, time after time

23
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,640
If you're lost, you can look and you will find me

24
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,640
Time after time

25
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:44,640
If we fall, I will catch you while we wait

26
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,640
Time after time

27
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:45,640
Call it it to me

28
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:41,920

Tag's done.

128
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:05,200
hey guys we're back here with more orange lounge radio starting off in our

129
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:10,040
brand new studio we picked up and moved the things from Folsom and now we are in

130
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:13,280
a town called Rancho Cordova it's all still Sacramento so you know for those

131
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,060
you guys are curious where we're at we're just moved down the freeway a

132
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:20,920
little bit that's all so and I apologize because our audio levels are a little

133
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:26,000
bit screwy tonight and I really don't know the best way to fix them so we're

134
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,840
just gonna kind of adjust them as we go along tonight because I know it sounds a

135
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:34,100
little weird I think I sound very amplified I don't know you want it you

136
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:39,620
want always amped up I know Jamie sounds great I always sound great I don't know

137
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:42,940
maybe it's just the mics we kind of played mic roulette to a little bit to

138
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:46,420
try and bring some quiet people up and some loud people down but now I'm like

139
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:51,800
too loud it's weird I don't know anyway turn yourself down where which one am I

140
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:56,020
I don't even know which one I hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Oops

141
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:03,960
This is awesome radio. I know that check check. Okay, fine. You're listening to mic check radio

142
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,560
Yeah

143
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:12,320
Imagine that that we got nominated for that live 365 award thing two of them and the award show

144
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,840
The award show was last night

145
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:23,360
what Ultraman stop distracting me over there so we're nominated for two best of

146
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:27,160
life these five awards so we went to the little shindig they had last night and I

147
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:32,320
think we I think we looked pretty hot I gotta say we were certainly unique no

148
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:41,800
that's very drunk all these random people keep coming in here hi um is that

149
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:49,880
Anyway we're trying to do radio. I'm just gonna close my eyes so I can't see

150
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:54,760
people keep coming into the studio. The best of the Y365 awards were last night.

151
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:59,720
We went to the shindig. We didn't win but that's okay. We're cool with it because

152
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:04,600
you know when we when we looked at the chat room because they actually had the

153
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:08,480
chat room being projected on the nearby wall so we could see the chat and see

154
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,520
people talking about you know the awards and stuff. When we looked in the chat

155
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:16,720
room there was like six or seven people yelling like just screaming little fan

156
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,680
boys and fangirls and that was so cool to see so I really appreciate you guys

157
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:26,400
that joined us there in spirit last night and were yelling things probably

158
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,120
offending other broadcasters but that's okay some of them need their feathers

159
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:33,800
ruffled a little bit honestly but actually we met some very cool people

160
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:37,960
we met some very awesome other broadcasters I sure did so we were very

161
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:42,220
happy about that and then we also met some well we didn't really meet them but

162
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:46,100
we also saw some people that were kind of kind of jerks and we had no idea how

163
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:51,780
they were winning awards but that's all right that's the nature of the business

164
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:57,300
them's the breaks so we had those and we will break them in the future so we had

165
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:01,000
a good time and thanks you guys for getting us nominated even though we

166
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,620
didn't win it was still cool and we'll just try again next year all right um

167
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:11,340
also we're famous to anybody who saw us in the paper here recently and is tuning

168
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:15,140
in because of it welcome I swear our shows are usually not this disorganized

169
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:18,980
but it's interesting because the article that ran in the Sacramento Bee which is

170
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:22,620
our local paper pretty big paper around here it talks about how we do the show

171
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:26,760
every week in our Folsom apartment but when they interviewed us it was like

172
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:31,300
five weeks ago or so it was a little while ago so we've moved since then so

173
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:34,580
we've had been dealing with all that so we're not actually in Folsom anymore

174
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:39,700
We're still in the Sacramento area, but the story was very nice. It's a very lovely article. What'd you guys think? I?

175
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:41,700
Thought it was nice

176
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:47,060
It was nice. That's what was bigger than everything sort of in the shot

177
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:52,560
Your foot was very beautiful for those of you guys who haven't seen it yet. They put a giant picture

178
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:58,160
It's on the front page of the scene section, which is you know, like the I guess entertainment what's going on around town

179
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:04,160
Second front page huge picture that takes up like a quarter of the page. It's huge. It's Matt's foot

180
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:10,640
With me and Jamie looking on in the background. It's just this ginormous foot. It looks like a Monty Python sketch seriously

181
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,840
so

182
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:17,020
Matt was very elated to see that picture and show all his friends look my foot

183
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:21,160
Yeah, I just added to the excitement of this entire weekend. Yay

184
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:26,320
He was the first comment on my live show. He's like, I love how the only picture of me is both my foot

185
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:31,720
I started laughing that was funny I think it would have been cool if they

186
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:36,360
had actually put a picture that had a minute but yeah that would have been

187
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:41,620
nice but no that's never gonna happen all right well what we're gonna do now

188
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:44,800
we're gonna start the show so usually do although we got some tangents there

189
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,720
that's all right I just want to talk about those things real quick we're

190
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,960
going to be doing a little bit of how is your week how is your day where we go

191
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:53,640
around and find out what's going on in people's lives so and I know everybody's

192
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:58,780
got a lot to say. We weren't live last week, we were taped, we still had a new show, um,

193
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:01,700
and I hope you guys are tuning in, because there were two cage matches to vote on last

194
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:06,220
week, and we're gonna talk about the winners of those very shortly. Um, but first, a little

195
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:09,580
chance to catch up on the past two weeks, and your day. So start off with the lovely

196
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:15,940
Dark Sakura. My week was complete and utter shit. And when I say complete and utter shit,

197
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:19,160
the only way it could have been worse is if a house fell on my car, which I expected it

198
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:25,760
to do on Friday. Wednesday I actually got up in a really good mood and I was all happy.

199
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:30,960
Go out and my trunk is open and my window is rolled down. They stole the CD player out

200
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:35,900
of my car, the fuckers, including a really good Gorillaz compilation CD that I put together

201
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:40,640
to listen to in my car. But they didn't take anything else, which I should be grateful

202
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:47,160
for because my Bond CD was in my car too. But it just, you know, it was sort of like

203
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:50,240
the icing on the cake for me that day I was stressed out for school and I

204
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:54,320
finally just ended up staying home that day because I was too stressed. Next day

205
00:23:54,320 --> 00:24:01,680
I get in my car I'm driving to work and this guy driving a taxi van pulls out in

206
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:09,680
front of me and I run into him. I have pretty bad muscle contusion which in

207
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:15,800
like normal people's terms is a big bad bruise around my hip and a pinched nerve

208
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:22,800
And now I'm on Vicodin, Flexeril, and 800mg of Ibuprofen and lots of alcohol to make me

209
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:26,480
feel better.

210
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:31,080
I still need to find out, because it's totally not my fault, but I need to get the guy's

211
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:33,720
insurance company to pay for the damages to my car.

212
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,240
I can't drive my car.

213
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:40,000
We can probably hammer the fender back into some kind of shape that I can drive it in

214
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,480
now, although my alignment is a little bit off.

215
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,160
but it's not undriveable except the fact that the fender keeps rubbing against my right

216
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,160
tire.

217
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:52,240
Um, nobody was hurt, um, well, I was hurt, but the other guy was nice too, so I don't

218
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:57,360
want to hear anyone saying, oh, well that fucker this, or, you know, fuck him, because

219
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,360
he was a nice guy.

220
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:01,000
He really was, and I feel bad for him too.

221
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,800
Oh, thank you, I got a yea from me being on Vicodin again.

222
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:08,880
I do actually do pretty damn good writing when I'm on Vicodin, so maybe I'll start writing

223
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:19,240
again um and then it was just a whole bunch of just different crap but it's

224
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:24,320
been a really weird weekend because I got made a moderator on the gorillas

225
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:30,640
unofficial board which is one of the big ones there run by a really cool crew

226
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:41,760
there I also we went to the live 365 awards and where we were gonna go over

227
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:47,160
that later I won something on the list a little bingo thing that they did I'll go

228
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:53,380
over that later too and something else good happened but for the life of me I

229
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:57,440
can't remember what it is it's like I can't remember my life anymore unless I

230
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:03,320
read my damn live journal other than that though it's been I've been a weird

231
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:07,120
combination of either going from incredibly elated to just super

232
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:14,840
depressed over everything so if I'm in a weird mood blame the Vicodin all right

233
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:22,160
yeah and I didn't play anything okay let's go over to Loki how was your week

234
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:29,860
how was your day dare I ask well this last three weeks have sucked it's been

235
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:34,820
just busy I haven't actually had time to rest my new jobs just stressful as hell

236
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:44,180
and I'm just tired yesterday I drove 200 miles to the San Francisco today I drove

237
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:51,260
200 miles to Oakland Oakland and mind you this was about seven hours after I

238
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:55,020
I drove to San Francisco and back.

239
00:26:55,020 --> 00:27:02,120
So I got back today and I'm tired and just I'm hungry because I haven't eaten that much

240
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:09,540
today and yesterday and it just sucks and then this week is going to suck more.

241
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:14,940
Just one big huge thing of suckage and then Comcast decided, you know, hey we're not going

242
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:18,940
to hook up the cable right and then, you know, that didn't work all week so I couldn't actually

243
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:24,280
play final fantasy 11 or anything that sucked so I can get back to that finally

244
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:33,260
and then what else no not really much of anything then Jonas didn't show up with

245
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:37,860
food yeah he was gonna come tonight and bring food he's probably the only person

246
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:41,860
in town that didn't show up tonight that's all right though you know if you

247
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:46,900
make a commitment to bring food god damn it you better show up because I count on

248
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:53,500
this food no I don't know so yeah that it sucked today I got to hang out with

249
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:58,700
Nellie's grandparents who can't speak any English in fact they go we can't

250
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:03,100
speak English and English are the first thing they said to me so they okay and

251
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:06,980
they're all you can't speak English and because they didn't know how to say you

252
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:13,700
know can't can you speak Russian so they like you can't or can you speak English

253
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:18,980
and then she kind of like shook her head like no that's alright no like ah wrong

254
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:30,460
words yeah and then she was interesting Tetris no that's not the international

255
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:35,220
it's the international game of peace didn't you know you should have whipped

256
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:40,960
out your copy of Tetris and been all do you understand Tetris no instead I

257
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:47,040
I played Ridge Racer and it's getting goddamn hard now, since I, once you beat, um, um,

258
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:52,320
Pro Circuit, um, 18, that's pretty much the actual official end of the game, and then

259
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:59,200
from there on it's all really hard shit. So I got the Beat the Devil car today. That sucked,

260
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:04,760
because it just uses nitros constantly, but I rock and I beat it four times, so I eventually

261
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:10,260
got that. Then I unlocked the Super Rally X car, which is all pixelated. It has blocky

262
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:14,940
wheels that's funny so I got that too that was fun we have a comment from the

263
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:20,560
chat room www www.orangelandtrader.com click on chat legend is that who says

264
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:26,500
Loki I dare you to take some of Jamie's Vicodin I can't swallow pills so no I

265
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:31,620
don't think Jamie would give any of it up anyway oh she is she shouting no for

266
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:35,820
the bathroom I don't like fucking pills I'm fine I don't have a headache I'm

267
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:41,420
just starving so I'll eat some later I thought about stuff because honestly

268
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:47,260
before we came here okay I got back at my house at about 530 okay I said to

269
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:52,460
myself because I was exhausted you know after driving all day and just it just

270
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:56,900
sucked so I laid down like I'm just gonna lay down for a second my mom

271
00:29:56,900 --> 00:30:01,980
calls me at like 615 says hey yeah she's trying to talk to me about the

272
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:06,900
a newspaper article because I left a message for her. I'm like, aw shit, I gotta go. I'm

273
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:12,500
supposed to be at the show already. Damn it. So then I get here, I have to park way the

274
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:16,700
fuck down the road, and for some reason I thought Rob's apartment number was like something

275
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:21,220
else than it was, so I'm walking around going, where the fuck is it? All these goddamn buildings

276
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:27,140
look the same! Aw, this sucks! So then I walk down to the end, I'm like, okay, count the

277
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:36,300
buildings that okay here you go here you go and then so yeah but that's not I'm

278
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:41,340
just tired I'm really tired you know it we'll get into that all later you know

279
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:46,020
about all the wonderful things that you encounter while driving long distances

280
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:53,140
mainly bad drivers yeah all that to come later on lovely all right who else is in

281
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:56,540
here let's go over to Arcadian 42 who joined us snuck in there a little bit

282
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:58,540
How was your week? How was your day sir?

283
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:03,880
Last week we went to Jamie's party. That was last Saturday. It's pretty fun to go down there and

284
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:06,180
to

285
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:08,020
MGL and

286
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:14,060
Dave and Buster's they didn't go till since last year played games and stuff like that. Most of the week was just work

287
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:19,420
getting the prepared for their boss to go to Europe for three weeks and

288
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:22,500
So that was that

289
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:28,500
Other than that, on Friday I went and saw Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, which is a pretty good movie.

290
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:38,500
That was a very good adaptation of the books. Sort of draws from all of the books, but mostly, of course, Paul is the first one.

291
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:44,500
And then yesterday he didn't do much, and today he didn't do much, and he came here.

292
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:50,500
Alright, let's go over to Ice Queen, if he can take a minute away from PictoChat. How was your week, how was your day?

293
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:54,580
Oh, it was just wonderfully entertaining.

294
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:58,140
Actually the past three weeks have been, you know, pretty much wonderfully entertaining.

295
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:02,900
I have, in the last three weeks, spent over $1,000 on my truck, that piece of shit that

296
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:06,260
has no grill, whatever you call it, on the front.

297
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:09,780
So you look at the front of the truck and you see the radiator, which is absolutely

298
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:11,340
lovely.

299
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:17,420
After that, I pretty much just have been working, lovely new job.

300
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:23,340
I'm a paper pusher for $10 an hour, woohoo.

301
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:26,140
Other than that, not much, oh yeah.

302
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:28,620
I decided to try to get clever with my computer.

303
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:34,080
It's had some viruses on there that aren't being detected and fixed by the Norton Antivirus.

304
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:41,680
So I went in there on Friday night and followed an online chat, or an online FAQ regarding

305
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:46,820
how to fix this specific virus, the ISASS.EXE.

306
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:54,160
And not knowing any better, the fact told me that I should go ahead and go into the

307
00:32:54,160 --> 00:33:00,740
safe mode, under administrator, and change the permissions for the user to deny.

308
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:06,060
Well, me not being any more aware than I was, I went ahead and did that, which then locked

309
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:14,220
up all of my Windows files, no longer had access to explorer.exe as the process, so

310
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:20,740
So I have no desktop, had no start menu, and I had no access to the MS Config feature,

311
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:23,100
which would not allow me to go back in and change my permissions.

312
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:27,940
So I spent the whole weekend pretty much just going through my computer.

313
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:31,100
Neil, you are a dork.

314
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:36,580
Anyway, I went through and actually Neil helped me out quite a bit.

315
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:37,580
Did most of the work.

316
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:40,860
He went in, added the software back in there and got everything working again.

317
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:46,860
So now I'm just waiting on the operating system to load back up, and hopefully I'll have my computer.

318
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:51,860
Oh, and yeah, World of Warcraft, I started playing that. That game rocks.

319
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:57,860
It's better than Final Fantasy XI, only because you can actually solo and not have to worry about it.

320
00:33:57,860 --> 00:34:01,860
So yes, it does. Brett said that doesn't make a game better? Oh, it does.

321
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:03,860
I am antisocial, I hate people.

322
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:05,860
I'm still waiting for Ragnarok 2.

323
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:06,860
I'd rather build things up on my own, thank you.

324
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:11,280
Then it makes the game more suited for you, but other people like to play multiplayer

325
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:16,800
With the only games suited for antisocial people are those that are offline. Oh

326
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,200
You mean just all other video games. Yes

327
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:25,960
Okay, you can play Ragnarok online completely antisocial because I leveled myself into the 80s. Yeah by myself

328
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:30,160
Oh that Ragnarok online is the ultimate solo world online RPG

329
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:38,160
I don't know, actually this Guild Wars game everybody's been talking about sounds like a very solo-friendly game.

330
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:40,160
Blue Burst Beta will be out in a few weeks.

331
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:43,160
But do we get to play Blue Burst?

332
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:45,160
No, no, US Beta.

333
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:47,160
Do we have to pay monthly fees to play it?

334
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,160
Not for the Beta.

335
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:51,160
Oh, okay. Well, anyway.

336
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:56,160
What are you doing? You said you're playing as DS and you should be doing a radio show.

337
00:34:56,160 --> 00:35:01,160
I wanted to join the Picto chat orgy so shoot me. Hey, don't go anywhere. How was your week? How was your day? Thank you, Stow.

338
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:07,160
Oh, fabulous. Um, no, it's been kind of sucky.

339
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:18,160
We have, uh, me and, uh, the Rice Princess are, both have jobs now and, uh, it's kind of hard to, when you only have one vehicle, to get everybody where they need to go.

340
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,220
So we've been looking for a car and every single time we go

341
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,020
To go check out a car

342
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:27,460
It is apparent within a few minutes that the people do not know what they're talking about and do not know how to take care

343
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:29,460
of their vehicles, so

344
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,460
Yeah

345
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:36,280
So far no luck. So pretty shitty. Oh, I went and saw Hitchhiker's Guide also today

346
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:39,500
We did we both went and saw it and it was good liked it

347
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:44,180
So yeah, I think it's a sci-fi movie for even non sci-fi fans

348
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:50,020
like even they would like it my favorite part and it's a big spoiler I feel like

349
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:55,860
a soap I think I'm a sofa uh-huh that one's pretty funny but I love the whale

350
00:35:55,860 --> 00:36:03,580
yes yes the whale it's not a spoiler I doubt anybody like not many many people

351
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:09,660
have read this book it's kind of a cult thing yeah bunch of people's redhead

352
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:17,660
Yeah, like, but, when you say a bunch of people have read it, it's like, nothing compared to how many people have read the Bible.

353
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:29,660
You know, just because a few thousand people here and there have read a book, that may be more than I have ever met in my life, but hey, it's, yeah, it's not a huge thing, so, whatever.

354
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:37,660
I just wanted to share with the chatroom that they're not the only ones who feel like they have not seen the movie because I have not seen the movie, so don't feel too left out, you guys.

355
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:42,460
you guys. I'll see it eventually. Did you see Kung Fu Hustle? Oh my god! Go see Kung

356
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:47,140
Fu Hustle now! Honestly, if I had to choose between movies to see, and then when I went

357
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:51,100
and saw The Hitchhiker's Guide, I would have rather seen Kung Fu Hustle. Just because-

358
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:54,740
You haven't seen it? No, I haven't seen Kung Fu Hustle yet, but I saw Hitchhiker's Guide

359
00:36:54,740 --> 00:37:00,260
and then, oh, Kung Fu Hustle is friggin' awesome. You know what I want to see? What I would

360
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:04,820
like to see is not paying $10 to go to a goddamn movie. That's what I would like to see. I

361
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:11,820
Like, you need to do that. You just go find the attractive looking gay guy at the movie theater place and just say, hey.

362
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:18,820
Yeah, because that's the universal mating call, you know. It's, hey. What the fuck is wrong with you?

363
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:24,820
Anyway, my week and my date, just been very busy with all the moving stuff that's going on.

364
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:32,820
What more can be said? I'm just so busy, but I'm so happy to have it all done.

365
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:36,340
and I'm finally moved in here and I'm getting comfortable in here and all that

366
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:40,700
and finally things will settle down and then e3 is just around the corner and

367
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:44,300
then we get to go into panic mode again so that should be exciting we'll see

368
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:50,260
what happens all right anyway what we're gonna do now and I'm I'm still adjusting

369
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:55,540
the sound levels kind of as we go along here so I apologize is this my mic here

370
00:37:55,540 --> 00:38:00,780
I don't know maybe you should figure that out I don't know I'm so lost all

371
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:05,620
Alright, anyway, what we're going to do now is we're going to take a break and we're going

372
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:09,100
to play some new popin' music during this break.

373
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:10,100
It's brand new.

374
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:11,580
We haven't played this on the station yet.

375
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:17,940
It's Popin' Music 12, although it's really Popin' Music Iroha, but it's just frickin'

376
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:19,060
Popin' Music 12.

377
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:22,100
They're just trying to give it new names so that you'll forget that there's so damn many

378
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:23,100
of these games.

379
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:24,100
Like 2DX?

380
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:25,100
Yeah.

381
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:28,140
But there's a lot of good music in this one.

382
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:31,420
off with a remix of Star Mine. It's pretty interesting, so I'm gonna start

383
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:36,020
off with that. Also in this, you're gonna hear some new Akira Yamaoka, a remix of

384
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:40,220
the theme from Goemon is in here, and then the new Good Cool song is in here

385
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:43,980
as well. So we're gonna hear all that during this break, and we'll be back with

386
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:50,980
more Orange Lounge Radio!

387
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:45,980
One, two, three, four!

388
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:15,980
You

389
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:55,500

🎵Kusuto ni🎵

396
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:37,660
I used to shake it, you used to screw me, we used to dive into the light.

397
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:44,660
You're just a shaking, you're just a grooving, we're just a shining silver line

398
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:49,660
Kie kaketa naku no ki wo kurau

399
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:51,660
Love is sweet as

400
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:56,660
Sayou ga oshi e te kureru

401
00:44:58,660 --> 00:45:01,660
Omoite mano se naku re ni

402
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:05,660
Watsu e mona wo shinai yori

403
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:39,660
Just a-shakin', just a-groovin', just a-divin' to the life

404
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:58,660
Jumpin', jumpin', rushin' down all around, everybody get up, you can't get down, no

405
00:45:58,660 --> 00:46:05,660
I am so shaking, you're just a prune, we have to start each other's lives

406
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:09,660
I'm just a-shakin', you're on the prowlin' heart

407
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:13,660
It's just fine, it's just fine

408
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:50,900
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 140, and we're in our brand new studio.

409
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:54,020
It's kind of interesting because it's a little bit smaller than what we were dealing with

410
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:57,980
before, but, you know, that's the way things go sometimes.

411
00:46:57,980 --> 00:46:58,980
Yeah?

412
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:02,780
Oh, it's just a throwback to when the show first started.

413
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:03,780
Kind of.

414
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:06,580
It's a throwback to studio number one, which we were in for about the first, what, 50 episodes

415
00:47:06,580 --> 00:47:07,580
or so?

416
00:47:07,580 --> 00:47:09,580
I've got a much comfier chair.

417
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:14,460
Did you notice, by the way, we actually put the big, green, comfy chair in here just for

418
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:15,460
you, Darkstalker?

419
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:16,460
Yes, and I appreciate it.

420
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:17,460
Thank you very much.

421
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:18,460
No problem.

422
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:20,960
It was a bitch moving it in here, although, really, all I did was yell at, you know, Brad

423
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:25,100
and Bugs, too, you know, move this way, no, no, don't hit the wall, don't do it.

424
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:27,380
I greatly appreciate the presence of the chair in here.

425
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:28,380
It's nice.

426
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:31,180
And then, behind Darkstalker, now, she doesn't let us put her on the webcam, so we can't

427
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:34,420
really show you, but maybe we'll take a picture or something later, but you can see the Jay

428
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:37,860
and Silent Bob Strike Back poster that says, all you motherfuckers are gonna pay, you are

429
00:47:37,860 --> 00:47:39,020
the ones who are the bollikers.

430
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:42,700
We have that right behind Jamie's chair, appropriately enough, I think, for her.

431
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:44,940
You are the ones who are the ball lickers.

432
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:45,940
Thank you.

433
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:50,100
Anyway, um, so during the break there we were listening to some music from, uh, the new

434
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:51,100
pop music, Yeroha.

435
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:52,100
What do you guys think?

436
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:53,100
Dark Sucker.

437
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:54,100
It sucked.

438
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:55,100
It sucked.

439
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:56,100
Very ass-worthy.

440
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:59,900
The Star Mine remake, you guys didn't like it?

441
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:02,140
I thought it was cute.

442
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:04,500
I don't think it's that bad.

443
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:05,500
I didn't hear the Star Mine one.

444
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:06,500
I only saw the Go-Emon one.

445
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:07,500
What?

446
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:08,500
The Go-Emon one.

447
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:13,500
I didn't hear it, but what was it playing?

448
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:18,500
Did it say Honey?

449
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:20,500
No, it's the other one, not Ryusei Honey.

450
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:22,500
Oh, the rock one.

451
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:23,500
Yeah, the rock one.

452
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:26,500
That is my least favorite Kiryamuka track ever, so don't ask.

453
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:29,500
I enjoy it more than 250 BPM, that's for damn sure.

454
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:34,500
Strangely enough, 250 BPM has warmed on me. I like it now. I hate that, whatever that new song is, sorry.

455
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:40,460
Sorry, I can't stand 250 BPM and I hate the crack baby in the video, too. I've always hated that so

456
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:48,340
Somebody hold a towel over the video and then I could pass it

457
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:53,560
If you do if it does sound like our audio levels are being fucked with don't adjust your settings

458
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:54,500
There's nothing you guys are doing

459
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:57,860
We are fucking with our audio to try and get the sound that we used to have in the old studio

460
00:48:57,980 --> 00:49:00,760
Because like when I have the headphones on it's really bugging the hell out of me

461
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:02,760
So I have Loki our tech expert

462
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:07,520
Gauging the audio right now, so he's sitting there listening carefully and trained little knobs

463
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:11,760
So you can tell we were very well prepared for tonight's show, but what can I say?

464
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:14,760
I had to go see the Lion King today, so I had no time to prepare because you know

465
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:17,160
It's not every day you get to go see the Lion King

466
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:22,560
Yeah, well unless you're in the play

467
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:25,640
Yeah, unless you're in the play. I think it's bugging the hell out of you

468
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:29,960
Just because you could actually hear your voice now, and it's different, and I don't like different things

469
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:35,400
that's my problem hey you you're different get out let's beat him up he's

470
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:42,680
different all right you're not wearing a silly hat so while we were talking about

471
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:45,600
games hey oh I thought you were leaving I'm like don't worry yet because I want

472
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:49,000
to ask you about guitar freaks and drum mania V because you got a chance you

473
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:53,880
said you played drum mania V or guitar freaks V all right tell it because I

474
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:58,720
haven't played either one I saw drum mania V at MGL when I went over there

475
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:01,320
for Dark Chakra's birthday which I want to talk about your birthday party a little more

476
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:05,400
in detail than we got into earlier. But we went over to Milpitas Golf Land to play and

477
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:09,200
I saw Drumania V and I was like hey it's Drumania and I fucking suck at it so I'm gonna go over

478
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:13,840
here to Guitar Freaks. I didn't even bother to check out V. So how is the V series? I

479
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:18,680
haven't even really looked at it. Well I only really got one play in because I was running

480
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:22,720
low on time there so I only got one play at Guitar Freaks V. They didn't have Drumania

481
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:29,940
via our golf land up here in Roseville. So, that's unfortunate. I prefer Drummania over

482
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:35,060
Guitar Freaks. So whatever, I gotta play one game of Guitar Freaks V. The song selection,

483
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:43,020
I think, is better than some of the previous ones. To me, after Guitar Freaks V, the song

484
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:50,980
selection has kind of gone downhill. I mean, when they got rid of, was it, frickin' Spring.

485
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:52,980
Hotter Spring

486
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:26,980
So it's not really a very interesting new addition or useful addition.

487
00:51:26,980 --> 00:51:30,980
Other than that, it seems like it's pretty much just the same old Guitar Freaks.

488
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:35,980
It looks like the resolution looks higher, it looks more clear.

489
00:51:35,980 --> 00:51:38,980
So you're looking at the notes look like they scroll smoother.

490
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:45,980
It's like the fifth mix of Guitar Freaks basically, like GGR fifth mix, how they added that.

491
00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:51,980
I mean, but other than that, it's no real big woo-ha, wow, awesome new Guitar Freaks, so...

492
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:56,980
I'll have to go check out the Drummania V first before I can give my final answer,

493
00:51:56,980 --> 00:52:00,980
because I want to play a session. I haven't played a session in a long time, so...

494
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:04,980
I know, what's up with that? Like, Golfland and all those places don't really have, like, the session mode like they used to,

495
00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:08,980
and the session was so cool when they had it, and now it's gone.

496
00:52:08,980 --> 00:52:13,980
Yeah, they really should get a Keyboardmania V to go with the Guitar Freaks Drummania,

497
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:18,180
because the keyboard mania may not have been nearly as popular as the other games

498
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:23,300
um it was fun to have the four-person session that was always good times I

499
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:29,940
still want sax mania mania oh yeah or what was the axe freaks what was the

500
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:35,860
other one if it's the head mania the pole that you just yeah anyway sax

501
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:40,620
machine anyway uh Arkadia 42 I know you're big on the guitar freaks and

502
00:52:40,620 --> 00:52:46,620
So I'm curious, you at Milpitas Golf only got to check out Drawmania V, so I'm kind of curious what you thought.

503
00:52:46,620 --> 00:52:53,620
That's pretty much similar it seems. I didn't really notice the videos or anything just because I wasn't really looking at them.

504
00:52:53,620 --> 00:52:56,620
I was just looking through the song list. The song list seems pretty good.

505
00:52:56,620 --> 00:53:02,620
I noticed there was a lot of older songs that they brought back from various older mixes.

506
00:53:02,620 --> 00:53:06,900
like void and what was the other one I really noticed like

507
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:11,140
oh crap I can't remember like wild ride which only showed up in one

508
00:53:11,140 --> 00:53:14,740
was like a special track in one of them that only showed up and that one was

509
00:53:14,740 --> 00:53:18,220
like seventh mix I think and

510
00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:22,620
yeah it seemed pretty good the way they do the song select

511
00:53:22,620 --> 00:53:25,740
only shows like five or six songs at a time it makes it harder to see what

512
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:29,500
songs are in it so that was probably the bad thing about it but

513
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:31,740
Otherwise, it seemed pretty cool.

514
00:53:31,740 --> 00:53:33,380
I'd have to play it more, because I only played it twice,

515
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:37,100
and then we had to run off to Dave and Buster's.

516
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:39,380
So I didn't get to have that much chance to play it, and I

517
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:42,820
haven't been to Roseville Golf Land in like two months, so

518
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:47,020
can't really comment on Guitar Freaks V yet.

519
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:50,540
But yeah, seemed all right.

520
00:53:50,540 --> 00:53:52,940
You know what's interesting is that while you guys were

521
00:53:52,940 --> 00:53:55,820
checking out V, I was actually checking out 11th Mix of

522
00:53:55,820 --> 00:53:58,140
Guitar Freaks finally for the first time.

523
00:53:58,140 --> 00:53:58,980
And it's fun.

524
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:03,680
It's very pink, but you know, I had a good time and I played it. So, you know, what can I say?

525
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:06,180
Did you check out any of those to go traffic?

526
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:12,580
You mean yeah, you might beat me in the final. Yeah, was that the first time you check that out? No. Oh, okay

527
00:54:12,860 --> 00:54:14,060
You know one game though

528
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:18,140
I want to kind of transition to this topic because I there was another game you got to check out for the first time

529
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:22,380
Tell us about it. I played the retard game. I mean in the groove

530
00:54:23,380 --> 00:54:25,700
It's no holds barred from you apparently

531
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:34,700
It has good music. Everything else about it was utter and complete ripoff. I also don't like that you can't go backwards in the menus.

532
00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:48,700
I realized that for the first time as well the other day when I fucked one of my modifiers severely. I could not go back. Unless there's a way you do it differently than DDR, but I figured everything else was the same as DDR. So the way you would move back would be the same and it doesn't work.

533
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:49,700
It was just really stupid.

534
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:52,700
Guess how you go back, you fail your first song and put more coins in.

535
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:57,700
What an ingenious idea, how to make more money.

536
00:54:57,700 --> 00:55:00,700
It really wasn't that much of an... it wasn't really an innovation at all.

537
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:04,700
And the songs were longer, which in some cases was okay.

538
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:08,700
But overall, the steps were awful. I mean, really awful.

539
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:10,700
It felt like playing like a Korean mix.

540
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:18,700
There were some good steps in Korean third, but I'm talking about how many jumps there were and everything.

541
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:26,700
which I really hate doing, and it just, you know, it was like playing, like, um, like, uh, Konami of Hawaii's steps.

542
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:29,700
That's how it was.

543
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:32,700
That's a bad inside reference.

544
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:35,700
So, but you don't mean, like, UltraMix 2 steps, because those...

545
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:37,700
I mean, like, Konami's.

546
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:43,700
Oh, or like, um, uh, service, or, I keep saying services, song packs one through six.

547
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:45,700
Yes, like playing those.

548
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:52,700
Okay. I keep saying service pack. I always say service pack because I get it confused with Microsoft. Song packs one through six then.

549
00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:57,700
Yeah. That's how, that's, it was Konami of Hawaii steps.

550
00:55:57,700 --> 00:56:04,700
You know, I've actually played In the Groove probably two times, at least two times this week if not three. I don't know, I've lost count.

551
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:13,400
I'm warming up to it a little more but I don't know so I still I'm like I feel

552
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:17,860
like this is just something to hold me over until the real thing is back I feel

553
00:56:17,860 --> 00:56:22,580
like I've gone from regular soda to diet soda and I'm still trying to get used to

554
00:56:22,580 --> 00:56:27,660
that nasty aftertaste that you get from diet soda that's kind of how it is and

555
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:31,100
like I'm like you know as soon as they come out with a new flavor of soda I'm

556
00:56:31,100 --> 00:56:36,780
gonna go right back to it that's how I feel about this whole thing once they

557
00:56:36,780 --> 00:56:42,700
put the cocaine back in the coca-cola you'll be very rare to go you'll need

558
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:45,280
the diet because the cocaine will take care of that for you well so here's the

559
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:49,100
interesting thing what do you think it's going to be like on PlayStation 2 I

560
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:52,980
haven't put much thought into it it's not like I'm gonna waste my money on it

561
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:55,780
well here's the issue you might want to start thinking about it because guess

562
00:56:55,780 --> 00:56:57,940
where we're going on Wednesday, you and I.

563
00:56:57,940 --> 00:57:00,540
That's true, there's that.

564
00:57:00,540 --> 00:57:05,220
Somehow, we have managed to get an invite to the In The

565
00:57:05,220 --> 00:57:08,140
Group premiere party in San Francisco.

566
00:57:08,140 --> 00:57:10,620
So we're going to go check out the In The Group on

567
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:13,220
PlayStation 2, and here's the great thing.

568
00:57:13,220 --> 00:57:15,340
The invite said, no, I haven't told you this.

569
00:57:15,340 --> 00:57:17,740
I was waiting for the show to tell you this, specifically on

570
00:57:17,740 --> 00:57:20,380
the show, free drinks.

571
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:23,100
Oh, cool, liquor.

572
00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:26,700
Now what I'm curious about is what if for every drink you

573
00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:30,340
have to say something nice about In The Groove?

574
00:57:30,340 --> 00:57:31,900
Lame.

575
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:33,860
I like this song.

576
00:57:33,860 --> 00:57:35,700
This song's cool too.

577
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:37,220
It doesn't suck that much.

578
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:40,900
I need to download this song.

579
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:44,700
Which is interesting because my biggest problem with In The

580
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:49,020
Groove is that half the songs don't do it for me.

581
00:57:49,020 --> 00:57:50,940
I'm not as big on the song list.

582
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:52,940
I like the hip-hoppy ones, actually.

583
00:57:52,940 --> 00:57:56,940
See that? No, I guess that's where we differ, because I don't care for those tracks.

584
00:57:56,940 --> 00:57:58,940
The trance I can do without, because trance is...

585
00:57:58,940 --> 00:58:06,940
See, I actually like the really, like, stupid, uh, dance-y covers of, like, mouth and torn and all that stuff.

586
00:58:06,940 --> 00:58:12,940
I want innovation in music, and all trance is is rehashing. That's all it is.

587
00:58:12,940 --> 00:58:15,940
Let's add some synthesizer to it and call it music.

588
00:58:15,940 --> 00:58:21,060
here's the issue with trance is it's all just disco sped up with lots of

589
00:58:21,060 --> 00:58:26,900
synthesizers disco you know well there's a lot of dancing and involved in disco

590
00:58:26,900 --> 00:58:31,540
so I guess it works but there's just not a lot of talented trance artists out

591
00:58:31,540 --> 00:58:36,820
there you got to go to the very select few artists like one I'm really big on

592
00:58:36,820 --> 00:58:40,140
right now Yuzo Koshiro he does an awesome soundtrack for that one gun

593
00:58:40,140 --> 00:58:45,660
Midnight Maximum yeah just very few good artists will do trance well so most of

594
00:58:45,660 --> 00:58:48,900
time you're just gonna find shitty trance tracks if you're yeah like just

595
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:54,180
badly fine on every single compilation out there yeah exactly and in to me that

596
00:58:54,180 --> 00:58:57,340
my favorite trance the songs that I think that are actually good trance

597
00:58:57,340 --> 00:59:01,140
songs are done by artists who don't technically they don't really do trance

598
00:59:01,140 --> 00:59:04,980
typically they do normal like delirium there's this song I'm really loving

599
00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:10,260
yeah I'll tell you about later whatever yeah his microphones on but these mics

600
00:59:10,260 --> 00:59:12,940
are acting very weird I don't know I think it's because this was a cardio

601
00:59:12,940 --> 00:59:16,940
It's because Rob's too loud and Brad's too quiet.

602
00:59:16,940 --> 00:59:19,940
That's what it is. I can't make them both work.

603
00:59:19,940 --> 00:59:21,940
There's no perfect medium, you know?

604
00:59:21,940 --> 00:59:25,940
No, there isn't. It's either you talk too close to the mic of you being Rob,

605
00:59:25,940 --> 00:59:29,940
because obviously pointing does not really, you know, show its way through radio.

606
00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:32,940
Well, there's the camera. They can see it.

607
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:34,940
You're pointing at the camera. You're pointing at the audience.

608
00:59:34,940 --> 00:59:37,940
You! Camera! You are talking too loud.

609
00:59:37,940 --> 00:59:42,020
no honestly cuz I'm talking and I'm starting to like

610
00:59:42,020 --> 00:59:45,240
you know static out and I'm not even hitting the peak yellow yet

611
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:48,420
which am I something to do out somewhere I got

612
00:59:48,420 --> 00:59:52,020
I don't even know what the hell you guys did the support here I don't know

613
00:59:52,020 --> 00:59:52,660
where to

614
00:59:52,660 --> 00:59:56,860
you jinx it would show to curse I don't know

615
00:59:56,860 --> 01:00:00,420
but anyway check check the levels going into the

616
01:00:00,420 --> 01:00:03,620
go to the computer check look at the hardware in the computer

617
01:00:03,620 --> 01:00:07,500
me me me yeah he anyways

618
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:09,500
Turn down the mic boost.

619
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:13,500
What we might want to do is maybe do a mic shuffle back to the mics we used to have.

620
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:14,500
I don't know.

621
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:15,500
Mic shuffle...

622
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:16,500
Alright.

623
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:20,500
I'm on the mic that I used to be on and I'm still fine.

624
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:21,500
I don't know. It's just...

625
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:22,500
It's nothing. I'm not gonna worry about it.

626
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:24,500
It's something that I turned up and I'm trying to...

627
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:25,500
Moving forward.

628
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:26,500
Yeah, moving on.

629
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:28,500
I'm sorry. It's just, you know, the sound issues are important.

630
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:30,500
If they can't hear us, you know.

631
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:31,500
If they can't hear us, they can turn up the radio.

632
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:35,500
So if you're just joining us, we are doing our first show in the brand new studio,

633
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:39,100
so we've got audio issues tonight but hopefully we will be able to you know

634
01:00:39,100 --> 01:00:42,540
make everything work out so just bear with us and we'll get through this it

635
01:00:42,540 --> 01:00:45,900
also could be that these headphones suck it might be so I'm not gonna worry about

636
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:50,220
it the chat room has been yelling like when levels are fine I don't know so

637
01:00:50,220 --> 01:00:55,120
maybe you want to pay attention to them it's on delay yeah all right whatever

638
01:00:55,120 --> 01:00:58,100
let's try leaving the audio here let's switch back and just see what happens

639
01:00:58,100 --> 01:01:03,220
looks like our audio is okay now I don't know it's hard to tell so we'll see what

640
01:01:03,220 --> 01:01:11,220
happens. Moving on, so we have that In the Groove thing going on Wednesday. Let's try

641
01:01:11,220 --> 01:01:21,900
and think what else is going on in the Bhumani world right now. Anything Dark Sakura that

642
01:01:21,900 --> 01:01:26,660
you would like to see in the In the Groove release on PlayStation 2 that you didn't see

643
01:01:26,660 --> 01:01:28,160
in the arcade game?

644
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:33,160
Um, a lack of suckage.

645
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:44,160
I mean, it didn't 100% suck, but honestly, it's not DDR, you know?

646
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:45,600
It's like a big rip-off of DDR.

647
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:47,060
I can't get into it.

648
01:01:47,060 --> 01:01:51,560
I cannot look at that game without thinking, wow, they totally bid on DDR.

649
01:01:51,560 --> 01:01:52,560
Sorry.

650
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:55,560
That's how I feel.

651
01:01:55,560 --> 01:01:58,040
Whoops, my mic was off, sorry.

652
01:01:58,040 --> 01:01:59,280
That's all right, you're welcome to your opinion.

653
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:05,400
What we're going to do now, let's move into talking about

654
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:06,480
last week's show.

655
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:10,520
And last week's show, we actually had not one, but two

656
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:12,640
cage matches that took place last week.

657
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:13,880
And it was a tape show.

658
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:17,160
And I hope you guys are able to tune in and check it out.

659
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:21,160
And in that, we did two cage matches.

660
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:24,120
The first cage match was talking about the

661
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:25,480
ultimate cage match.

662
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:30,480
In other words, we've had three songs that have been retired from Orange Lounge

663
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:32,840
Cage Match, meaning they won four weeks in a row.

664
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:37,280
So we decided to face off each of those songs against each other and see what

665
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:40,040
the ultimate Cage Match victor would be.

666
01:02:40,040 --> 01:02:43,800
So you guys curious to hear which song won that?

667
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:44,480
Sure.

668
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:48,680
All right, based off your votes on orangeloungeradio.com, because that's

669
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:53,040
why we voted in both Cage Matches this week, the winning song of the ultimate

670
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:56,800
cage match meaning that this is just like the best song I guess you guys

671
01:02:56,800 --> 01:02:59,380
think we've played in the past hundred episodes we've been doing the cage match

672
01:02:59,380 --> 01:03:01,680
is

673
01:03:04,100 --> 01:03:13,200
echo image with comeback that was our ultimate cage match because we did each

674
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:19,820
song that got retired pay attention like you still all right so echo image will

675
01:03:19,820 --> 01:03:26,220
comeback was the winner also we did another cage match and that cage match

676
01:03:26,220 --> 01:03:32,940
was choosing which song should be banned from orange lounge radio forever okay

677
01:03:32,940 --> 01:03:38,300
and we let you guys vote on that and it's what we call a reverse cage match

678
01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:44,300
and you guys picked a winner I guess really more appropriately would

679
01:03:44,300 --> 01:03:50,020
probably be a loser but the if the songs that were up were Britney Spears with my

680
01:03:50,020 --> 01:03:54,780
prerogative and that was Jamie's pick and then I picked a DJ speedo featuring

681
01:03:54,780 --> 01:04:00,100
wild side with the ketchup song I'm sorry J and then Loki picked kids bop

682
01:04:00,100 --> 01:04:10,980
kids doing bring me to life with Corky wake me up all right you guys want to

683
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:15,380
You know what song is being banned from Orange Launch Radio Forever?

684
01:04:15,380 --> 01:04:22,180
Here it is.

685
01:04:22,180 --> 01:04:29,340
So, Kids Bop Kids, Bring Me To Life, Banned From The Station, Forever, good riddance,

686
01:04:29,340 --> 01:04:31,340

Yes.

688
01:04:32,340 --> 01:04:35,660
Do you have a cage match picked today already?

689
01:04:35,660 --> 01:04:37,660
Yes, I do.

690
01:04:37,660 --> 01:04:40,420
Tuba, isn't that the lyrium thing?

691
01:04:40,420 --> 01:04:49,600

692
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:56,560

694
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:02,980
topics and into tonight's cage match I figured to I humored the discussion

695
01:05:02,980 --> 01:05:06,720
we've been having all actually and our chat room has kind of been asking for

696
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:10,400

697
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:19,720

698
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:12,400

01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:42,400
I'll tear you down

700
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:45,400
Where the people are bleeding deep

Better stay out, Charlie

702
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:24,400
I saw you last night in your fancy outfit

703
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:28,400
I'm the man in the dark streets

704
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:31,400
With the touch to George's body

705
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:33,400
Let's meet the eyes

706
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:36,400
So please take care of yourself

707
01:08:37,400 --> 01:08:40,400
Don't give away everything you own

708
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:43,400
Someone will give you back

709
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:46,400
You understand that you have loved

710
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:51,400
Charlene, you're still killing the sister of mine

711
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:55,400
Better stay off the drugs and the wine

712
01:08:55,400 --> 01:08:58,400
Don't be lost in the danger we see

713
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:00,400
My sister Charlene

714
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:03,400
Stay out Charlene

715
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:07,400
Just beware of the dark side of town

716
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:10,400
There's no passion inside to turn you down

717
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:14,400
We're the people of need in need

718
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:17,600
You better stay up, Charlene

719
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:20,600
I'll see you, Charlene!

720
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:37,040

01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:40,740
guys we're back with more orange laundry yeah the new promos was something else

722
01:13:40,740 --> 01:13:44,020
on the list of things to do that didn't get done but we've just been busy you

723
01:13:44,020 --> 01:13:48,460
We heard about our dramatic week, so we'll just get past

724
01:13:48,460 --> 01:13:51,620
it and do something more constructive later on.

725
01:13:51,620 --> 01:13:54,020
We are going to open up the Skype line very, very soon.

726
01:13:54,020 --> 01:13:57,140
So head on over to www.orangelauncherator.com and

727
01:13:57,140 --> 01:13:59,820
click on Interact With Us if you have no clue what I'm

728
01:13:59,820 --> 01:14:00,420
talking about.

729
01:14:00,420 --> 01:14:01,820
Because that's the only way you guys are going to get to

730
01:14:01,820 --> 01:14:04,380
call in and interact with our station.

731
01:14:04,380 --> 01:14:06,500
First, though, I want to point out the songs that we played

732
01:14:06,500 --> 01:14:07,040
in that break.

733
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:11,220
We played Banzai with Anubis, Missing Heart, Charlene,

734
01:14:11,220 --> 01:14:15,500
Smiley with Shusha and Ka with Don.

735
01:14:15,500 --> 01:14:19,660
Now, here's the interesting thing about Don.

736
01:14:19,660 --> 01:14:20,940
And I hope I still have this.

737
01:14:20,940 --> 01:14:22,140
I hope I didn't get rid of it.

738
01:14:22,140 --> 01:14:23,900
I'll be pissed if I did.

739
01:14:23,900 --> 01:14:27,060
I probably did and didn't even realize it.

740
01:14:27,060 --> 01:14:29,340
Shoot, I think I did.

741
01:14:29,340 --> 01:14:31,300
Let me run a search real quick.

742
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:35,180
Well, we actually used to spin the song Don on our station a

743
01:14:35,180 --> 01:14:39,260
long time ago when we first started.

744
01:14:39,260 --> 01:14:43,180
And it was one of those, this isn't in a Bimani game yet,

745
01:14:43,180 --> 01:14:45,420
but it will be someday, we think.

746
01:14:45,420 --> 01:14:48,900
And heaven forbid, it actually did show up in a game.

747
01:14:48,900 --> 01:14:50,740
Although it wasn't really a Bimani game.

748
01:14:50,740 --> 01:14:52,660
It was more of a, you know, one a Bimani game.

749
01:14:52,660 --> 01:14:56,300
But I don't know.

750
01:14:56,300 --> 01:14:57,500
Wannabeemani, get it?

751
01:14:57,500 --> 01:14:58,260
Wannabeemani?

752
01:14:58,260 --> 01:14:59,900
Wannabe?

753
01:14:59,900 --> 01:15:01,180
I read that on a forum somewhere.

754
01:15:01,180 --> 01:15:04,100
I thought it was funny.

755
01:15:04,100 --> 01:15:06,060
Darn, I wish we had it.

756
01:15:06,060 --> 01:15:07,340
I think I actually, oh, no, no.

757
01:15:07,340 --> 01:15:07,860
I do have it.

758
01:15:07,860 --> 01:15:08,260
Listen to this.

759
01:15:08,260 --> 01:15:08,860
Listen to this.

760
01:15:08,860 --> 01:15:13,140
This is dated July 23rd, 2002.

761
01:15:13,140 --> 01:15:16,260
This file's dated July 23rd, 2002.

762
01:15:16,260 --> 01:15:17,860
That's three years ago.

763
01:15:17,860 --> 01:15:22,060
And now, an original work that could one day very well be in

764
01:15:22,060 --> 01:15:23,580
a Bomani game.

765
01:15:23,580 --> 01:15:26,540
This is Keel with the song Dawn.

766
01:15:26,540 --> 01:15:31,660
If you like what you hear, visit www.amcast.com slash

767
01:15:31,660 --> 01:15:34,740
K-E-E-L.

768
01:15:34,740 --> 01:15:36,700
See, that was like, I don't know how long ago.

769
01:15:36,700 --> 01:15:37,900
July 2002.

770
01:15:37,900 --> 01:15:39,960
And I don't even know if that website exists anymore.

771
01:15:39,960 --> 01:15:41,720
And he changed his name and all that stuff, too.

772
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:43,800
So very interesting.

773
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:46,000
So let's see.

774
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:50,080
We played that before it was in a music rhythm game.

775
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:52,480
I think we've had, what, three songs from our cage match that

776
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:54,220
ended up in a music rhythm game that we

777
01:15:54,220 --> 01:15:56,220
played here first.

778
01:15:56,220 --> 01:15:58,060
I just like thinking we're cool.

779
01:15:58,060 --> 01:16:01,760
Inflate my ego here a little bit, please.

780
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:02,960
All right.

781
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:04,640
Anyway, let's do this.

782
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:05,920
We're going to open up the Skype line.

783
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:10,300
And so go ahead and give us a call and we'll hear from what you have to say.

784
01:16:10,300 --> 01:16:15,800
If you want to talk to us about, what will we let them talk to us about tonight?

785
01:16:15,800 --> 01:16:19,520
In the Groove, the award show if you guys were listening last night, just whatever is

786
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:20,520
on your mind.

787
01:16:20,520 --> 01:16:21,520
You need to talk.

788
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:22,520
I really don't care.

789
01:16:22,520 --> 01:16:27,040
We need to talk about Renee, Sebastian, and her chef, you know, Mrs. Chef is what I'd

790
01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:28,040
like to call.

791
01:16:28,040 --> 01:16:31,320
Yeah, what was that, those artists that played in the Live 365 Awards.

792
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:38,320
I had a lot of respect for those folks because they were very passionate and very talented unlike a lot of folks

793
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:39,560
I see on the television

794
01:16:39,560 --> 01:16:45,880
But I don't know if I totally was into all the music because that one girl the first girl to sang

795
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:52,360
She was totally like chef like her first two songs were very like, you know, like Norah Jones ish, but better like

796
01:16:52,360 --> 01:17:03,280
I want you to lay me down, and start screwing me up and down, and then you're gonna come

797
01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:04,280
into me.

798
01:17:04,280 --> 01:17:07,520
I swear to God that was one of the lyrics, like, you're gonna come into me.

799
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:09,680
And I was like, oh my God, this chick is foul.

800
01:17:09,680 --> 01:17:11,520
And the gospel people were there too.

801
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:14,080
What's great about the song is it went on too long.

802
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:22,080
She's like, and then I want you up and down, up and down, around, up, down, up and around and ooh, ah, ooh, ah, ah, ah.

803
01:17:22,080 --> 01:17:29,080
Suddenly she was singing DDR steps and how to find her G-spot, actually. Anyway, we're going to take a call.

804
01:17:29,080 --> 01:17:31,080
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

805
01:17:31,080 --> 01:17:37,080
Emerging from the shadows of the Mani style, your resident 2DX bastard DarklionXVI is here.

806
01:17:37,080 --> 01:17:43,880
Alright, alright, alright. No one, everyone doesn't need their own intro, like, you know, we're not gonna do this, like, WWE style, or,

807
01:17:43,880 --> 01:17:50,580
Ooh! Ooh! It's Kinsmell with The Rock Is Cookin'! And then just play the music, and, or anyways, go ahead.

808
01:17:50,580 --> 01:17:51,580
Whatever.

809
01:17:53,580 --> 01:17:56,580
You just got told, whatever, he said, whatever.

810
01:17:57,580 --> 01:17:59,080
What's on your mind, Ziggy?

811
01:17:59,580 --> 01:18:03,580
Yeah. Uh, congratulations on, uh, on your new studio.

812
01:18:03,580 --> 01:18:06,780
thank you it's actually kind of a little bit of a downgrade

813
01:18:06,780 --> 01:18:10,940
but the apartment itself is very very nice so you know we're

814
01:18:10,940 --> 01:18:14,100
I'm I'm very happy with it and we like being cozy

815
01:18:14,100 --> 01:18:17,620
don't we kids I can reach out and touch Jamie in the studio

816
01:18:17,620 --> 01:18:20,700
my knee

817
01:18:20,700 --> 01:18:26,380
that was the sound that she made when I touched her knee no we like it it's cool

818
01:18:26,380 --> 01:18:27,820
we're gonna do a lot of good things here

819
01:18:27,820 --> 01:18:32,100
so thank you yeah what else is on your mind buddy

820
01:18:32,100 --> 01:18:41,100
Well, you know, last Friday I was able to play 2DX Red and I, you know, I was able to pass three level 8 plus songs.

821
01:18:42,100 --> 01:18:44,100
Oh, which one?

822
01:18:45,100 --> 01:18:49,100
The three songs are Take It Easy, Setsugekka, and Rainbow Rainbow.

823
01:18:50,100 --> 01:18:52,100
So wait, you played them past them or you just...

824
01:18:52,100 --> 01:18:53,100
Yeah, I passed them all.

825
01:18:54,100 --> 01:18:55,100
Well, you big stud.

826
01:18:55,100 --> 01:19:03,160
Are you one of those folks on Bamani style that gets into those, you know, those pissing

827
01:19:03,160 --> 01:19:07,600
contests about, you know, I passed this, or yo, I passed this, I passed this blindfolded

828
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:11,280
with one hand and I'm better than Lisu and dubba dubba duh.

829
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:13,280
No, I'm not one of those.

830
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:14,280
Okay, good, good.

831
01:19:14,280 --> 01:19:20,640
I just want to say, if you were, we'd have to shoot you.

832
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:24,160
But yeah, I just want to have my say about Germania V.

833
01:19:24,160 --> 01:19:27,400
Wait, you want to say something about Drummania Guitar Freaks V?

834
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:29,320
Yeah. What's on your mind?

835
01:19:29,320 --> 01:19:34,360
Well, uh, yeah, there's some new stuff on Drummania V, as everybody's saying.

836
01:19:34,360 --> 01:19:38,480
And, uh, yeah, they, you know, they have the, like, uh,

837
01:19:38,480 --> 01:19:41,560
sorting it out, they have, like, they have, uh,

838
01:19:41,560 --> 01:19:44,820
folder 80D or something like that.

839
01:19:44,820 --> 01:19:46,840
It's really interesting.

840
01:19:46,840 --> 01:19:52,360
I haven't seen the game myself yet, so I can't really comment, but okay.

841
01:19:52,360 --> 01:19:56,020
I hope to play it someday, but I refuse to go to Roosevelt Golf Land to look at it because

842
01:19:56,020 --> 01:20:02,180
that place is a dump, but someday.

843
01:20:02,180 --> 01:20:03,180
Anything else on your mind?

844
01:20:03,180 --> 01:20:05,580
Well, that's kind of it.

845
01:20:05,580 --> 01:20:06,580
How's night style coming?

846
01:20:06,580 --> 01:20:09,460
Have you cleared everything yet, or you still have some songs to go?

847
01:20:09,460 --> 01:20:11,380
Well, I can do bag one-handed.

848
01:20:11,380 --> 01:20:15,460
What are you doing with it?

849
01:20:15,460 --> 01:20:17,500
But I haven't made any double A's yet.

850
01:20:17,500 --> 01:20:19,660
Yeah, what do you do with the other hand?

851
01:20:19,660 --> 01:20:20,660
What?

852
01:20:20,660 --> 01:20:24,220
Well, because you play bag one-handed. What does the other hand do?

853
01:20:24,220 --> 01:20:27,500
Well, it's the scratch, of course. Oh, okay.

854
01:20:27,500 --> 01:20:30,220
That's boring.

855
01:20:30,220 --> 01:20:34,020
Lankystyle's calling you out saying that that's two hands if you use one for scratching.

856
01:20:34,020 --> 01:20:38,220
One hand is actually, you know, just bring keys, it's all two hands.

857
01:20:38,220 --> 01:20:41,580
I know, a lot of people play, well like,

858
01:20:41,580 --> 01:20:45,980
I play with like six fingers when I play, usually,

859
01:20:45,980 --> 01:20:50,140
because I just use my thumb to hit the first two keys and I use my hand for the rest of them.

860
01:20:50,140 --> 01:20:52,980
So I play six finger. Is that worth something?

861
01:20:52,980 --> 01:20:57,740
Yeah, six finger. Is six finger 2DX playing worth anything on the forums?

862
01:20:57,740 --> 01:20:59,180
Like if I go post, I go, hey guys,

863
01:20:59,180 --> 01:21:02,500
I'm a six finger 2DX player. Who wants to touch me?

864
01:21:02,500 --> 01:21:06,820
I play one finger when I watch people pass those and others.

865
01:21:06,820 --> 01:21:10,140
No, one finger. Guess what finger that is?

866
01:21:10,140 --> 01:21:14,140
Now what do you do with the other nine fingers?

867
01:21:14,140 --> 01:21:15,860
Nine?

868
01:21:15,860 --> 01:21:18,940
Well the others are busy being held down while the one is

869
01:21:18,940 --> 01:21:21,980
gloriously extended in all of my fuck you glory

870
01:21:21,980 --> 01:21:26,900
and then the other one is usually a usually a

871
01:21:26,900 --> 01:21:31,580
I don't know, getting money, I don't know. Getting a dollar.

872
01:21:31,580 --> 01:21:34,780
Get a dollar. Alright. Put a dollar in the token machine to play something else.

873
01:21:34,780 --> 01:21:38,180
We're just messing with you, Siggy, that's cool that you... That's alright, that's alright.

874
01:21:38,180 --> 01:21:40,940
Alright. We're teasing, you know. That's cool that you're doing the one-handed thing.

875
01:21:40,940 --> 01:21:45,180
I think that's kind of a nice way to play because you know... And lose your other hand free for things like

876
01:21:45,180 --> 01:21:46,660
Doritos and...

877
01:21:46,660 --> 01:21:50,500
Or when you play keyboard mania, you're going to want to

878
01:21:50,500 --> 01:21:53,920
be able to do as much of that kind of note thing with one

879
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:54,900
hand as possible.

880
01:21:54,900 --> 01:21:55,860
That's the one thing I always know.

881
01:21:55,860 --> 01:21:58,300
Have you played much keyboard mania at all?

882
01:21:58,300 --> 01:22:01,420
Well, I have played keyboard mania twice back at MGL.

883
01:22:01,420 --> 01:22:01,820
Right.

884
01:22:01,820 --> 01:22:04,580
And you really have to do the one hand.

885
01:22:04,580 --> 01:22:06,980
If you're going to play on the expert levels, you have to be

886
01:22:06,980 --> 01:22:09,660
able to do things with one hand up here while you're

887
01:22:09,660 --> 01:22:11,380
doing a completely different note pattern down here, just

888
01:22:11,380 --> 01:22:13,180
like a normal piano playing, really.

889
01:22:13,180 --> 01:22:14,740
So that's one thing I noticed.

890
01:22:14,740 --> 01:22:15,940
I don't know.

891
01:22:15,940 --> 01:22:21,700
Yeah, the only problem I have with keyboard mania is you don't know which fingers to press.

892
01:22:21,700 --> 01:22:27,780
They should have that, like which fingers to press, like three as in the middle finger

893
01:22:27,780 --> 01:22:30,140
or one for the thumb.

894
01:22:30,140 --> 01:22:32,420
Oh, like a guide as to, you know, what...

895
01:22:32,420 --> 01:22:33,900
Yeah, it's a guide.

896
01:22:33,900 --> 01:22:39,140
Yeah, you kind of have to know piano and they teach you that stuff in piano.

897
01:22:39,140 --> 01:22:41,340
But that would be cool if keyboard mania would show that stuff.

898
01:22:41,340 --> 01:22:43,700
I mean, hey, what a great sales piece.

899
01:22:43,700 --> 01:22:47,700
They could sell keyboard mania as a piano teaching device, which I guess they did.

900
01:22:47,700 --> 01:22:50,540
I didn't hear, they did get a limited release.

901
01:22:50,540 --> 01:22:54,020
But come on, how many people, who do you know that owns keyboard mania for PC?

902
01:22:54,500 --> 01:22:55,700
Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp, no one.

903
01:22:55,700 --> 01:22:56,140
That's right.

904
01:22:57,580 --> 01:23:00,420
So they could, they could mass market that if they wanted to.

905
01:23:00,420 --> 01:23:06,020
But they should just bring, I don't know, whatever.

906
01:23:07,140 --> 01:23:11,220
They should, they should have keyboard mania, like literally, you know, typing mania.

907
01:23:11,220 --> 01:23:15,620
They have that in Japan. The BeatMania da da da.

908
01:23:15,620 --> 01:23:19,660
And that's what I said when I played it. Da da da.

909
01:23:19,660 --> 01:23:23,820
Anyway. Alright, we're gonna let you guys take it, but thanks so much for calling in. Have a good one, okay?

910
01:23:23,820 --> 01:23:27,020
Yeah. Alright, later. Later. Do you have an outro?

911
01:23:27,020 --> 01:23:30,700
No. Okay. Bye. Later.

912
01:23:30,700 --> 01:23:34,100
I figured since he had this big introduction that he might have something to say as he's

913
01:23:34,100 --> 01:23:35,400
leaving, but I guess not.

914
01:23:35,400 --> 01:23:40,100
Let's see what our next caller has to say. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Hey, SSJ100, Matt here.

915
01:23:40,100 --> 01:23:43,540
Hello SSJ100, Matt here, what's on your mind?

916
01:23:43,540 --> 01:23:48,980
Nothing, I was ready to give my In The Groove review.

917
01:23:48,980 --> 01:23:50,980
Oh goody, let's hear it.

918
01:23:50,980 --> 01:23:52,580
Well, you know, I actually got to try it.

919
01:23:52,580 --> 01:23:57,300
It took him months to get it here, but anyways, at first,

920
01:23:57,300 --> 01:24:02,420
when I first played it about three times, I hated it.

921
01:24:02,420 --> 01:24:06,660
I hated the fact of like bombs and other stuff.

922
01:24:06,660 --> 01:24:08,620
Figured out you could take those off.

923
01:24:08,620 --> 01:24:12,360
you know actually when you played a bunch of times it's not that bad

924
01:24:12,360 --> 01:24:15,460
like you started to warm up to it a little bit like at first you're like this sucks

925
01:24:15,460 --> 01:24:19,500
i hate it but i can't stop playing it right

926
01:24:19,500 --> 01:24:20,800
that's kinda how i felt

927
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:23,300
for a little bit i was ok with it when i first played

928
01:24:23,300 --> 01:24:24,520
i was just neutral

929
01:24:24,520 --> 01:24:25,420
I was like

930
01:24:25,420 --> 01:24:28,480
this isn't as great as all the people on the internet say it is

931
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:32,000
but it's not as bad as a lot of people on the internet say it is either so i'm

932
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:36,760
just gonna stop paying attention to what i read on the internet

933
01:24:36,760 --> 01:24:40,720
Now I just switch off between that and DDR.

934
01:24:40,720 --> 01:24:44,320
So you have both In the Groove and DDR at your local arcade?

935
01:24:44,320 --> 01:24:44,720
Yeah.

936
01:24:44,720 --> 01:24:48,040
Do you notice if one is more popular than the other?

937
01:24:48,040 --> 01:24:50,120
Well, right now In the Groove is way more popular.

938
01:24:50,120 --> 01:24:53,120
Now I can get on the DDR all the time now.

939
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:55,680
You know what's interesting is that that's kind of the first

940
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:56,480
I've really heard of that.

941
01:24:56,480 --> 01:24:59,520
Because a lot of arcades I've been to, even when I went and

942
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:02,640
saw In the Groove in New Jersey last year when it was

943
01:25:02,640 --> 01:25:06,360
being beta tested or whatever, there were more people on DDR

944
01:25:06,360 --> 01:25:10,300
extreme than in the groove and I thought that was kind of interesting because I was like

945
01:25:10,300 --> 01:25:13,720
dude this is like one of two places in the nation where you can actually play this game

946
01:25:13,720 --> 01:25:18,600
and there's still more people playing DDR and even when I go to the local bowling alley

947
01:25:18,600 --> 01:25:24,380
that has more games I see more kids on DDR and I think the reason for that is that in

948
01:25:24,380 --> 01:25:29,240
the groove you know despite the fact that it's a technically good game and it's got

949
01:25:29,240 --> 01:25:35,080
you know good music and stuff it's just ugly it's a really like ugly game sorry to the

950
01:25:35,080 --> 01:25:39,960
the folks that designed the graphics, but it's kind of ugly. Like, DDR has that warm,

951
01:25:39,960 --> 01:25:45,560
saccharine, like, happy, crack vibe, right? Where as In the Groove has that, I'm industrial

952
01:25:45,560 --> 01:25:51,200
and I don't want anything to do with you vibe. I think maybe that's it. It's too Americanized.

953
01:25:51,200 --> 01:25:56,040
Maybe. I don't know. Is that, I don't know. So that's why I think more people are always

954
01:25:56,040 --> 01:25:59,400
on. So what would you say, if you gave In the Groove a score on a scale of one to five,

955
01:25:59,400 --> 01:26:03,120
what would you say? Well, when I first played it, I gave it about a six, and now it's like

956
01:26:03,120 --> 01:26:06,960
kind of like an eight or so. On a scale of one to five? That's incredible.

957
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:10,680
One to five, but I thought you said one to ten. Oh, one to ten. Well, that's fine.

958
01:26:10,680 --> 01:26:14,560
Doesn't matter, but. Alright.

959
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:19,080
Well, what else? Anything else you want to share with us?

960
01:26:19,080 --> 01:26:23,260
Not really, just congratulations on the new place. Thank you, we appreciate it. We

961
01:26:23,260 --> 01:26:25,800
hope we can get all our sound working and everything, although I think

962
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:28,440
everything's cool now.

963
01:26:28,440 --> 01:26:32,060
Yep. Alright. Well, thanks to Ablai. Have a good one. Thanks for calling in.

964
01:26:32,060 --> 01:26:35,220
Later.

965
01:26:35,220 --> 01:26:36,660
It's always nice to hear from folks.

966
01:26:36,660 --> 01:26:38,940
OK, what we're going to do, we're going to go into the

967
01:26:38,940 --> 01:26:41,580
Orange Lounge cage match right now.

968
01:26:41,580 --> 01:26:44,260
If you didn't get through, try back again later.

969
01:26:44,260 --> 01:26:45,860
A lot of you guys just keep hammering us.

970
01:26:45,860 --> 01:26:49,060
You just call again and again until they get through.

971
01:26:49,060 --> 01:26:50,460
You can stop doing that, because we're not taking any

972
01:26:50,460 --> 01:26:53,340
more calls until the cage match is over.

973
01:26:53,340 --> 01:26:55,220
But thanks for trying.

974
01:26:55,220 --> 01:26:56,060
And we'll get to you guys later.

975
01:26:56,060 --> 01:26:57,580
I know a lot of you guys have some things to say.

976
01:26:57,580 --> 01:26:59,420
And we'll get into some more Bahmani news a little later.

977
01:26:59,420 --> 01:27:02,640
We got some business to settle such as tonight's cage match

978
01:27:06,020 --> 01:27:09,180
Do you have a cage match on tonight Logan? Oh goody good. Oh

979
01:27:10,380 --> 01:27:14,700
Let's see. We're starting fresh. So as a reminder the way to cage match works

980
01:27:14,700 --> 01:27:16,580

983
01:27:28,420 --> 01:27:32,980

986
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:48,960
over at www.orange lounge radio.com the song I decided to put in tonight's cage

987
01:27:48,960 --> 01:27:53,500
match when I first heard this song I was like this song kind of reminds me of

988
01:27:53,500 --> 01:27:58,860
Of Erotic but without so much cheese like I don't know it's not so

989
01:28:01,020 --> 01:28:05,500
Stupid I don't know. I I just I thought the song was slightly better. It's more like aqua to me

990
01:28:05,580 --> 01:28:07,580
I don't know. It's like a mix of the two. We'll see

991
01:28:08,460 --> 01:28:12,620
All right. Yeah, I know you're excited about this. Anyway, here it is song number one tonight my pick. This is

When you close to me by my side, I feel the love I can hide

We're together, side by side

1017
01:30:58,640 --> 01:31:02,640
Cause I can't get enough

1018
01:31:02,640 --> 01:31:06,640

01:31:13,640 --> 01:31:20,640
In the name of, in the name of love

1021
01:31:43,640 --> 01:32:03,400
All right that was song number one in tonight's cage match that was jet set in the name of

1022
01:32:03,400 --> 01:32:04,400
love.

1023
01:32:04,400 --> 01:32:07,500
Let's go around and see what we think but remember it's not our vote that counts it's

1024
01:32:07,500 --> 01:32:11,600
yours you've got to be in the chat room and play www.orangetouch.com click on chat.

1025
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:17,880
Jamie. It gets one. It has no originality to it, nothing innovative. It sounds like

1026
01:32:17,880 --> 01:32:23,520
the same rehash. No offense, I mean, it was perky, and if I wanted to make myself really

1027
01:32:23,520 --> 01:32:29,960
happy, I guess I'd listen to it again. But there was no innovation to it. Nothing new.

1028
01:32:29,960 --> 01:32:36,720
Okay, I'll be nice with three. Alright. Logi. I'll not be nice because I don't like Aqua

1029
01:32:36,720 --> 01:32:39,000
or anything that tries to beat Aqua out here.

1030
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:43,280
I honestly don't like the whole happy, you know,

1031
01:32:43,280 --> 01:32:45,120
you got one guy that's, you know,

1032
01:32:45,120 --> 01:32:47,160
singing really deep and then the girls,

1033
01:32:47,160 --> 01:32:48,960
ah da da da, you know, so.

1034
01:32:48,960 --> 01:32:50,680
But it reminded me of sort of like

1035
01:32:50,680 --> 01:32:52,240
the woman's voice is out of place

1036
01:32:52,240 --> 01:32:56,240
and the guy found like a member of, you know,

1037
01:32:56,240 --> 01:32:58,320
the Bloodhound Gang, so I just,

1038
01:32:58,320 --> 01:33:00,360
I didn't really know, it didn't really feel right to me.

1039
01:33:00,360 --> 01:33:03,440
But because it's trying to be happy

1040
01:33:03,440 --> 01:33:05,200
and I'm not happy, it gets a two.

1041
01:33:05,200 --> 01:33:12,760
all right my thoughts I think that that song is you know it's like you take the

1042
01:33:12,760 --> 01:33:17,520
ironic and aqua songs which are like so happy to the point of nauseousness and I

1043
01:33:17,520 --> 01:33:21,560
think that song kind of strips a lot of that fakeness off so I think you guys

1044
01:33:21,560 --> 01:33:25,440
are kind of closing yourself off to it because it is a little bit formulaic but

1045
01:33:25,440 --> 01:33:30,400
whatever I think it's decent so I give it a 9 because it puts me in a good

1046
01:33:30,400 --> 01:33:43,400
make me happy. Angel. Uh, 4. Any reason why? It's kind of like awkward, but it's missing something.

1047
01:33:43,400 --> 01:33:52,400
Alright. Yeah. Uh, kdn42. It's happy. It was bouncy. It was generic. 5. Alright. And likeystyle.

1048
01:33:52,400 --> 01:33:58,400
Alright, what? What'd you think of that song? What are we doing here? Forget it. Alright.

1049
01:33:58,400 --> 01:34:00,760
Let's rank the song. What do you think? One to ten?

1050
01:34:05,520 --> 01:34:07,280
All right

1051
01:34:07,280 --> 01:34:11,640
Let's move on song number two is Jamie's pick. What'd you pick for us tonight, Jamie?

1052
01:34:11,640 --> 01:34:15,160
Um, I've been wanting to put this in like a month ago, but I kept winning

1053
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:19,800
It's Gorillaz Feel Good Inc. I know it's been playing on the radio, but I

1054
01:34:20,400 --> 01:34:27,360
Really really like this song a whole bunch. It's it's I really like everything they've been doing with music. It's been innovative

1055
01:34:27,360 --> 01:34:31,760
it's been new it's been taking the whole pop genre in a different direction so

1056
01:34:31,760 --> 01:34:37,560
and this one it just has a really sexy bass line too so I want that it's in all

1057
01:34:37,560 --> 01:34:41,560
Alright, here it is, song number two, Gorillaz Feel Good Inc. Enjoy.

1058
01:35:07,560 --> 01:35:23,560
The city's breaking down on the camel's back They just have to go cause they don't know where

1059
01:35:23,560 --> 01:35:30,560
So while you fill the streets, there's a billion to see You won't get out of the county cause you're nearly free

1060
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:33,760
You got a new horizon, it's ephemeral style

1061
01:35:33,760 --> 01:35:37,260
A melancholy town where we never smile

1062
01:35:37,260 --> 01:35:41,260
And all I wanna hear is the message beating my dreams

1063
01:35:41,260 --> 01:35:44,560
They got a kisser cause I don't get sleep, no

1064
01:35:48,060 --> 01:35:51,260
We mail, we mail for the land

1065
01:35:51,260 --> 01:35:54,760
The forever hanging land

1066
01:35:54,760 --> 01:35:58,260
Take it or leave it on your stride

1067
01:35:58,260 --> 01:36:03,260
It is taking for all in and love forever

1068
01:36:03,260 --> 01:36:06,760
Love is free, let's turn forever

1069
01:36:06,760 --> 01:36:08,760
You and me

1070
01:36:08,760 --> 01:36:11,760
Windmill, windmill for the mind

1071
01:36:11,760 --> 01:36:16,260
It's everybody in

1072
01:36:18,260 --> 01:36:20,760
Laughing, gasping, hazmat, fat cat

1073
01:36:20,760 --> 01:36:22,760
Lining them up like abstract

1074
01:36:22,760 --> 01:36:24,260
Play these ponies at track

1075
01:36:24,260 --> 01:36:26,260
It's my chocolate attack

1076
01:36:26,260 --> 01:36:27,760
Shoot, I'm steppin' in harder to skip

1077
01:37:27,760 --> 01:37:31,760
Kick it all out on your stride

1078
01:37:31,760 --> 01:37:34,760
It is taking for all

1079
01:37:34,760 --> 01:37:37,760
It's our love forever, love is free

1080
01:37:37,760 --> 01:37:41,760
Let's turn forever, you and me

1081
01:37:41,760 --> 01:37:44,760
Windmill, windmill for the land

1082
01:37:44,760 --> 01:37:49,760
It's everybody else

1083
01:37:52,760 --> 01:37:54,760
Go shop, see the dish

1084
01:37:54,760 --> 01:37:57,420
The fire captain said his baby watching Savagreen.

1085
01:37:57,420 --> 01:37:59,420
Ha ha ha ha ha!

1086
01:37:59,420 --> 01:38:01,420
Go shop, see the dude.

1087
01:38:01,420 --> 01:38:04,420
The fire captain said his baby watching Savagreen.

1088
01:38:04,420 --> 01:38:06,420
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

1089
01:38:06,420 --> 01:38:22,420
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

1090
01:38:25,420 --> 01:38:29,420
Song number two there, Guerrillaz with Feel Good Inc.

1091
01:38:29,420 --> 01:38:30,420
How did you guys feel?

1092
01:38:30,420 --> 01:38:32,420
Did that make you feel good or make you feel sick?

1093
01:38:32,420 --> 01:38:36,100
sick let's see Dark Sakura I've been listening to this song for two months

1094
01:38:36,100 --> 01:38:40,460
and haven't gotten sick of it yet so it gets a 10 automatically the whole album

1095
01:38:40,460 --> 01:38:44,420
gets a 50 million so yeah by demon days when it comes out

1096
01:38:44,420 --> 01:38:47,420
lucky

1097
01:38:49,940 --> 01:38:58,260
okay I had no mic no I have a good baseline I don't know it's just it's

1098
01:38:58,260 --> 01:39:04,900
Okay, I mean I like gorillas. I love their older stuff. It's just there's parts of the song

1099
01:39:04,900 --> 01:39:09,660
I didn't like then the other parts are okay, so it just gets like a seven or eight

1100
01:39:11,700 --> 01:39:13,700
Eight I guess

1101
01:39:13,900 --> 01:39:15,500
um

1102
01:39:15,500 --> 01:39:20,620
That song is kind of like a big cake to me like you've got frost like it's a multi-layer cake

1103
01:39:20,620 --> 01:39:22,540
You've got this really like nice frosting

1104
01:39:22,540 --> 01:39:26,180
And then there's like really sweet stuff in the middle like the fruit kind of well

1105
01:39:26,180 --> 01:39:32,500
you know we're talking like strawberry frosting oh no you had me going at frost

1106

1108
01:39:39,780 --> 01:39:43,780
chocolate so it's really sweet my point is it's really sweet like but the rest

1109
01:39:43,780 --> 01:39:47,380
of it's kind of cake it's just cake you know like because that song is kind of

1110
01:39:47,380 --> 01:39:51,620
like three things combined it feels like to me like there's different elements or

1111
01:39:51,620 --> 01:39:54,900
it's like you got a good cake and then they throw in that stupid custard

1112
01:39:54,900 --> 01:39:58,660
and he's like, oh god damn you, how did you ruin a good cake?

1113
01:39:58,660 --> 01:40:01,600
That's kind of like it, because there's two elements to that song,

1114
01:40:01,600 --> 01:40:04,860
I really, especially one of the slow parts to the song,

1115
01:40:04,860 --> 01:40:06,640
I really, really, really like.

1116
01:40:06,640 --> 01:40:08,020
The slow parts are very blur.

1117
01:40:08,020 --> 01:40:10,200
Yeah, see I like blur, I think that's why.

1118
01:40:10,200 --> 01:40:12,960
But then like the Day of the Soul stuff, that's like the custard.

1119
01:40:12,960 --> 01:40:14,420
I'm not good on it.

1120
01:40:14,420 --> 01:40:15,440
See, I like the opposite.

1121
01:40:15,440 --> 01:40:19,320
I like the Day of the Soul stuff, but I hated the slow parts.

1122
01:40:19,320 --> 01:40:22,960
Then I feel the opposite, but the score is still the same, I give it an 8.

1123
01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:24,820
Angel.

1124
01:40:24,820 --> 01:40:26,820
yeah I look good as well

1125
01:40:26,820 --> 01:40:28,820
so I will give it an 8

1126
01:40:28,820 --> 01:40:30,820
alright

1127
01:40:30,820 --> 01:40:32,820
not just because I'm copping you but not because I'm helping you

1128
01:40:32,820 --> 01:40:34,820
but just because you're copping us

1129
01:40:34,820 --> 01:40:36,820
arkadian

1130
01:40:36,820 --> 01:40:38,820
I like Boston cream pie

1131
01:40:38,820 --> 01:40:40,820
good

1132
01:40:40,820 --> 01:40:42,820
yeah Boston cream pie is cake with custard

1133
01:40:42,820 --> 01:40:44,820
yeah custard

1134
01:40:44,820 --> 01:40:46,820
and not grill is rock 2

1135
01:40:46,820 --> 01:40:48,820
9

1136
01:40:48,820 --> 01:40:50,820
alright uh lanky style

1137
01:40:50,820 --> 01:40:52,820
um

1138
01:40:52,820 --> 01:40:56,820
I don't think it makes me feel good, it makes me feel pretty ink, you know, but it's incorporated.

1139
01:40:56,820 --> 01:41:04,820
Um, no, you know what, I hate gorillas, like, they're always the source of any problem in, like, a sci-fi story.

1140
01:41:04,820 --> 01:41:06,820
Gorillas are monkeys too, right?

1141
01:41:06,820 --> 01:41:11,820
No, those are, you're thinking of, uh, uh, monkeys are not gorillas.

1142
01:41:11,820 --> 01:41:13,820
Okay, well, they're apes, they're simians, right?

1143
01:41:13,820 --> 01:41:16,820
The monkeys had Mickey Dolenz!

1144
01:41:16,820 --> 01:41:17,820
And Davey Jones.

1145
01:41:17,820 --> 01:41:19,820
Go over into this, exactly, Bradley.

1146
01:41:19,820 --> 01:41:21,820
However, Congo was a bad movie.

1147
01:41:21,820 --> 01:41:27,820
Gorillaz learn sign language and talk to us. Gorillaz are smart, except for QD.

1148
01:41:27,820 --> 01:41:30,820
And apparently they can sing through a megaphone.

1149
01:41:30,820 --> 01:41:37,820
And they also, you know, take women and run up the Empire's Day segment.

1150
01:41:37,820 --> 01:41:40,820
They run them up the Empire's Day building. Man, that is...

1151
01:41:40,820 --> 01:41:43,820
Will you please give the song a rating so we can finish this goddamn segment?

1152
01:41:43,820 --> 01:41:46,820
Okay, hold on. A little backstory here.

1153
01:41:46,820 --> 01:41:52,820
Um, no, really. I think this is the only good song on the new album. I've listened to the whole thing and I'm not impressed.

1154
01:41:52,820 --> 01:41:55,820
The last album was much better in my opinion.

1155
01:41:55,820 --> 01:42:01,820
Um, but it's still a good song. Like I said, it's the best song on the album, so it gets for me an 8.

1156
01:42:01,820 --> 01:42:06,820
Um, but it's gonna get old for me really quick. I've already listened to it like 4 times, but I'm still kinda like, hmm.

1157
01:42:06,820 --> 01:42:11,820
I did like the slow parts better than the rest of it. It's, I prefer blur.

1158
01:42:11,820 --> 01:42:12,820
Alright.

1159
01:42:12,820 --> 01:42:17,940
Let's get into the last song of tonight's cage match, Loki what did you pick?

1160
01:42:17,940 --> 01:42:28,820
Well I hope this is what's on this track here, uh, well hopefully this is um, oh my god I'm

1161
01:42:28,820 --> 01:42:35,160
saying hopefully a polytery track, anyway, hopefully this is the song from um, the Midnight

1162
01:42:35,160 --> 01:42:39,780
Tune 2 soundtrack.

1163
01:42:39,780 --> 01:42:45,140
I got midnight maximum soon too. Yeah, that's not or that that that CD. Anyway, it's an awesome game

1164
01:42:45,140 --> 01:42:49,460
It's like a it's sort of a initial D ish type thing

1165
01:42:49,460 --> 01:42:51,100
It's got pretty cool music in it

1166
01:42:51,100 --> 01:42:57,940
But then there's Paul Terry and Paul Terry, you know, honestly, um, I hate Paul Terry I hear but it's a face

1167
01:42:57,940 --> 01:43:01,460
The Paul Terry Niocchi combo that Paul Terry now see that it's bad

1168
01:43:04,260 --> 01:43:08,220
Other artists that's okay. And this is a song that she sings in

1169
01:43:08,220 --> 01:43:14,940
Um, okay, I don't remember the original artist, um, it's Yuzo Koshiro, featuring Polteri.

1170
01:43:14,940 --> 01:43:21,180
A guy that did music for Actraiser, and so this is the, um, song, um, Nothing Can Live

1171
01:43:21,180 --> 01:43:22,180
Forever.

1172
01:43:22,180 --> 01:43:26,020
Yuzo Koshiro featuring Polteri, Nothing Can Live Forever, song number three.

1173
01:43:26,020 --> 01:43:27,820
I am crossing my fingers, I hope this is the right studio.

1174
01:43:27,820 --> 01:43:28,820
Enjoy.

1175
01:43:28,820 --> 01:43:43,820
The time has come to say goodbye

1176
01:43:43,820 --> 01:43:55,820
Because nothing can be forever

1177
01:43:55,820 --> 01:44:04,820
But I'll keep calling out for you

1178
01:44:14,820 --> 01:44:18,820
I see the air stirring and churning

1179
01:44:18,820 --> 01:44:23,820
Cheer the speed of the chains

1180
01:44:23,820 --> 01:44:27,820
I am reaching my truth.

1181
01:45:53,820 --> 01:45:57,820
I refuse to take your cover, love

1182
01:46:04,820 --> 01:46:06,820
Can't catch up

1183
01:46:12,820 --> 01:46:16,820
I don't mind if I'm not the one in love for you

1184
01:46:16,820 --> 01:46:30,820
The time must come to say goodbye

1185
01:46:30,820 --> 01:46:40,820
Because nothing can keep me forever

1186
01:46:40,820 --> 01:46:47,820
But I keep going on and on

1187
01:47:10,820 --> 01:47:12,820
You

1188
01:48:40,820 --> 01:48:45,820
the

1189
01:48:45,820 --> 01:48:50,820
the

1190
01:48:50,820 --> 01:48:55,820
the

1191
01:48:55,820 --> 01:49:00,820
the

1192
01:49:00,820 --> 01:49:05,820
the

1193
01:49:05,820 --> 01:49:15,980
Okay, that was song number three in tonight's cage match.

1194
01:49:15,980 --> 01:49:22,140
That was Yuzo Koshiro featuring Polteri with Nothing Can Live Forever.

1195
01:49:22,140 --> 01:49:28,980
Will that song live forever in your memory or is it going to die right now, Jamie?

1196
01:49:28,980 --> 01:49:33,360
I don't like Polteri because she can't hold a key to save her life.

1197
01:49:33,360 --> 01:49:51,360
It was still pretty good. I mean, it's too trance for my taste, but overall it presented an image. That's what I can say. I like music that presents a picture, and that one I definitely got a feeling from, so it gets an eight from me.

1198
01:49:51,360 --> 01:49:53,220
Logie

1199
01:49:53,220 --> 01:49:58,140
You know this song I like her to be gained her with her like first thing you know over it

1200
01:49:58,340 --> 01:50:00,340
It's kind of like you know

1201
01:50:00,500 --> 01:50:05,960
It kind of built job for but then the song has like but I don't know it's an okay song

1202
01:50:05,980 --> 01:50:11,020
But I had because I haven't cut down certain other songs that I need to be submitting to the cage match

1203
01:50:11,300 --> 01:50:12,460
but uh

1204
01:50:12,460 --> 01:50:14,820
So it gets an eight that's the best

1205
01:50:14,820 --> 01:50:18,460
I'm gonna give it because but you got to check out the whole soundtrack really cool

1206
01:50:18,460 --> 01:50:24,460
Um, I like the first minute, and then the other four I fell asleep. I gave it a six.

1207
01:50:24,460 --> 01:50:25,460
Angel.

1208
01:50:25,460 --> 01:50:33,460
It was pretty cool, um, I'll be nice and give it a seven. Because I don't know what else

1209
01:50:33,460 --> 01:50:35,460
to give it, whatever.

1210
01:50:35,460 --> 01:50:36,460
Arcadian.

1211
01:50:36,460 --> 01:50:41,460
Eh, it was alright. I wasn't all that impressed. I haven't listened to the soundtrack yet,

1212
01:50:41,460 --> 01:50:43,460
but I'll give it a six.

1213
01:50:43,460 --> 01:50:44,460
Lanky style.

1214
01:50:44,460 --> 01:50:51,700
Thank you, so I'm one of the weird people who believe that voluntary can only do good when she couples with a belonging artist artist

Close enough.

1223
01:51:46,300 --> 01:51:50,700

1227
01:52:16,540 --> 01:52:18,540
No twist here, sorry.

1228
01:52:18,540 --> 01:52:23,540
Alright, this is the part of the show where I would always ask Loki what's going on in the sim scene.

1229
01:52:23,540 --> 01:52:27,540
I don't know if you've been keeping tabs on what's going on, but what's up, Loki?

1230
01:52:27,540 --> 01:52:38,540
Not that much. Honestly, really nothing going on. There's only like a couple things I'd like to mention.

1231
01:52:38,540 --> 01:52:55,540
First off, as far as sim packs being released, not really too much this week. However, there's this wonderful site that someone created because I don't know if you remember ddramerica.com, the old Bomani Torrent site.

1232
01:52:55,540 --> 01:53:05,540
No kidding, I was trying to fix that. Actually, it went down a while ago because sharing copied stuff is bad.

1233
01:53:05,540 --> 01:53:26,540
But anyways, there's this new one now called alt-control-delete-dot-com, and, uh, it's starting off to be a new, uh, Bimani, um, BitTorrent tracker, and you've got some of the, um, pop-in music, um, soundtracks, and, um, some 2DX, it's mainly soundtrack rips right now.

1234
01:53:26,540 --> 01:53:30,540
So, I guess that's something worth mentioning.

1235
01:53:30,540 --> 01:53:36,300
that room is yelling BMS contest and I guess something I think oh yeah but my

1236
01:53:36,300 --> 01:53:43,140
cells BMS contest they have that going on right now you sound excited I mean

1237
01:53:43,140 --> 01:53:50,820
come on now folks I mean really I guess it could be cool I mean cuz but I I just

1238
01:53:50,820 --> 01:53:59,660
you know what the Japanese doing BMS files I I don't think us it's just gonna

1239
01:53:59,660 --> 01:54:04,220
be up to par with it I'm sorry the Japanese have like got you beat by a lot

1240
01:54:04,220 --> 01:54:09,420
that that's my opinion on this stuff I mean you play Japanese BMS files and

1241
01:54:09,420 --> 01:54:15,180
you're like holy crap this stuff is like could have been in Beatmania or in 2dx

1242
01:54:15,180 --> 01:54:18,980
or something it's just really high quality stuff well also there there's

1243
01:54:18,980 --> 01:54:23,220
more of a team mentality to from what I understand it's set up like a

1244
01:54:23,220 --> 01:54:29,060
professional production crew I bet if more of the American producers of the

1245
01:54:29,060 --> 01:54:32,580
the BMS files got together and put the same kind of effort into it, they could come up

1246
01:54:32,580 --> 01:54:33,580
with a quality product.

1247
01:54:33,580 --> 01:54:34,580
Look at Food Mix.

1248
01:54:34,580 --> 01:54:37,540
Food Mix is a perfect example of like production quality.

1249
01:54:37,540 --> 01:54:39,620
I mean that's just top notch stuff right there.

1250
01:54:39,620 --> 01:54:43,440
You could honestly, if you know, they had the permission, you could release a DDR mix

1251
01:54:43,440 --> 01:54:47,860
of all Food Mix stuff and it would, you wouldn't have to really change anything to it.

1252
01:54:47,860 --> 01:54:49,780
It would look great.

1253
01:54:49,780 --> 01:54:55,620
And that's what's, you know, really cool about, you know, and BMS stuff is exactly the same.

1254
01:54:55,620 --> 01:54:57,980
They do all their remixing stuff on there.

1255
01:54:57,980 --> 01:55:02,340
The production quality is incredibly awesome.

1256
01:55:02,340 --> 01:55:05,760
And even with stuff, they only have movie files playing in

1257
01:55:05,760 --> 01:55:06,220
the background.

1258
01:55:06,220 --> 01:55:12,340
It's all just stop motion with bitmaps and jpegs and stuff.

1259
01:55:12,340 --> 01:55:15,300
And it still looks incredible.

1260
01:55:15,300 --> 01:55:16,380
I don't even know how to describe it.

1261
01:55:16,380 --> 01:55:16,900
It's awesome.

1262
01:55:16,900 --> 01:55:19,140
This is where OnoKen and stuff got its start,

1263
01:55:19,140 --> 01:55:20,940
is with the BMS files.

1264
01:55:20,940 --> 01:55:25,820
And, you really, I'm sorry, the U.S. is not gonna be able to come close.

1265
01:55:25,820 --> 01:55:31,580
They can try, but I've already had high standards for BMS files, and I'm afraid,

1266
01:55:31,580 --> 01:55:36,000
you know, like most everything else that the U.S. does, as far as SIM files go,

1267
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:39,220
I'm gonna be disappointed. But, hey, you know,

1268
01:55:39,220 --> 01:55:43,180
I'd like to still see what comes of this, too, because it'll be interesting.

1269
01:55:43,180 --> 01:55:46,780
You can get some- There's gotta be at least one quality file that comes with it. Oh yeah, I'm sure there's gonna be some

1270
01:55:46,780 --> 01:55:50,420
some good stuff, but there's gonna be some crap stuff, too. I don't have the patience to make a

1271
01:55:50,420 --> 01:55:54,140
step mania file let alone a BMS file you know I bet the three of us could get

1272
01:55:54,140 --> 01:55:59,820
together and do a really good BMS I would better things we spend our time

1273
01:55:59,820 --> 01:56:08,620
doing like eating sleeping sleeping or working on our station or something

1274
01:56:08,620 --> 01:56:15,580
doing promos all right and we don't do those but yeah so there's nothing really

1275
01:56:15,580 --> 01:56:23,100
going on as far as that is concerned what else oh yeah there's some more boss

1276
01:56:23,100 --> 01:56:29,180
files released by DJ pedo who like most other people I call themselves DJ is not

1277
01:56:29,180 --> 01:56:35,860
a DJ and boss files are retarded I like to mention you know for those who don't

1278
01:56:35,860 --> 01:56:41,840
know boss files are they're incredibly hard hard DWIs they're basically beat

1279
01:56:41,840 --> 01:56:48,520
media for step mania which it's just crap it's crap it's crap it's crap don't

1280
01:56:48,520 --> 01:56:53,440
play them yeah man that's not the number one problem with step mania files out

1281
01:56:53,440 --> 01:56:56,880
there on the internet as they're all trying to be be mania because nobody

1282
01:56:56,880 --> 01:56:59,840
plays step mania with an actual dance pad they're all using their fingers so

1283
01:56:59,840 --> 01:57:02,500
when they triple-a songs are taking screen caps of it and posting how big

1284
01:57:02,500 --> 01:57:06,080
their internet penis is because they triple-a to song with their fingers on a

1285
01:57:06,080 --> 01:57:10,520
dance game and then they complain because a lot of the ten footers and

1286
01:57:10,520 --> 01:57:14,080
stuff are too easy. Well, yeah, because you're using your fingers, dumbass. Try using your

1287
01:57:14,080 --> 01:57:21,240
feet. Exactly. Anyway. All right, you guys, let me hear who won tonight's cage match.

1288
01:57:21,240 --> 01:57:25,280
Show up! All right, you know what's interesting is that last week I think we had the most

1289
01:57:25,280 --> 01:57:29,440
number of votes I've ever seen in a cage match in a recent memory, and this week we have

1290
01:57:29,440 --> 01:57:32,600
some of the least number of votes in a cage match in a recent memory, so I don't know

1291
01:57:32,600 --> 01:57:38,520
what's up. Family guy. Huh? Family guy. Is it because of family guy? Come on, people.

1292
01:57:38,520 --> 01:57:43,200
was leaked to the internet like two weeks ago. I know, I've had an emergency all week.

1293
01:57:43,200 --> 01:57:48,000
You can get a torrent later or stop being cheap and buy a TiVo. We are far more important

1294
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:52,460
than that damn show. They'll just cancel it again, and you'll be sad. Oh man, that show's

1295
01:57:52,460 --> 01:57:57,780
awesome. Alright. But our show's awesomer. That's right, we're awesomer. Alright, anyway,

1296
01:57:57,780 --> 01:58:04,780
tonight's cage match winner is... In the name, or, not in the name of love, my bad, nothing

1297
01:58:04,780 --> 01:58:11,780
can live forever. Oh my god. I thought Gorillaz would have won. Yuzo Koshiro. I don't know,

1298
01:58:13,360 --> 01:58:17,140
maybe on another night where everybody was voting, but tonight we only had. Oh my god,

1299
01:58:17,140 --> 01:58:21,100
that's just like hardcore listeners voting. This was a filler song until I picked a good

1300
01:58:21,100 --> 01:58:24,640
one. Eh, it always works that way. Just wait until after we get back from E3 and the Demon

1301
01:58:24,640 --> 01:58:28,140
Days album is actually released so I can put that one song in. Mm-hmm. Because I can't

1302
01:58:28,140 --> 01:58:33,860
put it in before the album's out. Out of support for the band. Alright. Actually, I have to

1303
01:58:33,860 --> 01:58:39,620
it wasn't a bad song. You could play it. I will actually go ahead and say it was a bad

1304
01:58:39,620 --> 01:58:47,620
song. I could, but I won't. I know right away that it was a bad song. That's why I put it

1305
01:58:47,620 --> 01:58:53,180
in. I can't see how you can call my song repetitive and then put that in. I could play it, but

1306
01:58:53,180 --> 01:59:02,180
I won't, out of respect for my favorite band. I could play it. I'm teasing. Alright, anyway,

1307
01:59:02,180 --> 01:59:04,820
Let's see, what are we going to do now?

1308
01:59:04,820 --> 01:59:08,420
Actually, I want to do the DDR Freak post of the week,

1309
01:59:08,420 --> 01:59:09,240
because this is exciting.

1310
01:59:09,240 --> 01:59:13,940
By the way, DDR Freak does run our rewinds every Friday night

1311
01:59:13,940 --> 01:59:17,600
over on The Freak, so you guys should check that out.

1312
01:59:17,600 --> 01:59:22,100
If you ever miss part of this show, so if you must skip us

1313
01:59:22,100 --> 01:59:25,980
and go watch Family Guy, then I suppose you could catch up

1314
01:59:25,980 --> 01:59:28,140
with us on Friday night over on DDR Freak.

1315
01:59:28,140 --> 01:59:31,100
We're on the same week now, so tonight's show you will hear

1316
01:59:31,100 --> 01:59:33,100
this friday you have to wait a week anymore

1317
01:59:33,100 --> 01:59:36,500
credit books and you could download this dvd quality

1318
01:59:36,500 --> 01:59:37,460
on the internet

1319
01:59:37,460 --> 01:59:42,860
uh... my psp we watched it yesterday if i watched a lucky psp already okay and

1320
01:59:42,860 --> 01:59:45,420
granted it was very funny

1321
01:59:45,420 --> 01:59:49,580
it's still the same level of funny as it all yeah it's it's really funny and i

1322
01:59:49,580 --> 01:59:53,540
highly recommend it but not because it's against our show i'm sorry but you can't

1323
01:59:53,540 --> 01:59:55,100
go

1324
01:59:55,100 --> 01:59:57,060
exactly but we tried

1325
01:59:57,060 --> 01:59:58,380
Yeah, they'll re-run it.

1326
01:59:58,380 --> 02:00:00,340
You can get it on BitTorrent.

1327
02:00:00,340 --> 02:00:05,780
You can get a TiVo, stop being cheap, set your VCR.

1328
02:00:05,780 --> 02:00:07,100
Or tape us, I suppose.

1329
02:00:07,100 --> 02:00:08,460
But it's a little harder to tape the internet.

1330
02:00:08,460 --> 02:00:12,820
Or buy satellite and watch it East Coast time.

1331
02:00:12,820 --> 02:00:13,260
There you go.

1332
02:00:13,260 --> 02:00:13,580
There you go.

1333
02:00:13,580 --> 02:00:15,500
Because the East Coast people saw it before our show was on.

1334
02:00:15,500 --> 02:00:15,940
Exactly.

1335
02:00:15,940 --> 02:00:19,300
Anyway, let's get to the DER Freak post of the week.

1336
02:00:19,300 --> 02:00:29,180
A bunch of crazies over there on DER Freak. No, I'm kidding. There's some really great

1337
02:00:29,180 --> 02:00:32,820
people on DER Freak, but once in a while you get a few loonies that make very interesting

1338
02:00:32,820 --> 02:00:36,880
posts. And tonight's DER Freak post of the week was suggested to me by one of our chatters.

1339
02:00:36,880 --> 02:00:42,180
I want to say it was, uh, LXLdubes that suggested this one, and if it wasn't you and it was

1340
02:00:42,180 --> 02:00:48,580
somebody else, I apologize to that person. I think it was him. What? Oh. Hey. Post of

1341
02:00:48,580 --> 02:00:53,580
This is the week, this is not Turbo Graphic Segment, this is DDR Free Post of the Week, sorry.

1342
02:00:53,580 --> 02:00:57,580
Subject! The subject for this post.

1343
02:00:57,580 --> 02:00:59,580
DDR Fairy Tales.

1344
02:00:59,580 --> 02:01:03,580
You know, I came so close to locking that damn thread, and then I thought, nah.

1345
02:01:03,580 --> 02:01:06,580
Here it is. Here's the post.

1346
02:01:06,580 --> 02:01:09,580
I just thought this would be a funny idea.

1347
02:01:09,580 --> 02:01:14,580
Try to make a random fairy tale out of as many DDR song titles as possible.

1348
02:01:14,580 --> 02:01:16,580
Good luck!

1349
02:01:16,580 --> 02:01:20,580
Well, okay, that post isn't that great, but let's see some of the replies.

1350
02:01:21,580 --> 02:01:28,580
Once upon a time in the kingdom of Max 300, there was a noble prince named Jam Jam Reggae.

1351
02:01:30,580 --> 02:01:33,580
Okay, Yam Yam Ragu.

1352
02:01:34,580 --> 02:01:38,580
What the hell was that? I don't know anybody named Jam Jam Reggae, do you?

1353
02:01:38,580 --> 02:01:40,580
Makes no sense whatsoever.

1354
02:01:40,580 --> 02:01:48,980
Uh, let's see. Once upon a time, a prince upon a star, which is a Beatmania song, not

1355
02:01:48,980 --> 02:01:54,740
a DDR song, visited the Queens, Jamaica, again Beatmania, not DDR, where he met a man named

1356
02:01:54,740 --> 02:02:01,580
Gamble. If you want to get technical, you know, they were, um, in a club mix, whatever.

1357
02:02:01,580 --> 02:02:06,320
Again, he met a man named Gamble. But these songs weren't made famous. They were first

1358
02:02:06,320 --> 02:02:07,800
to beat mania, shut up.

1359
02:02:07,800 --> 02:02:11,520
This man had a lovely senorita named Nori Nori Nori.

1360
02:02:11,520 --> 02:02:14,600
Then they all died because they got ran over by a cowgirl

1361
02:02:14,600 --> 02:02:16,240
going maximum overdrive.

1362
02:02:16,240 --> 02:02:19,480
The end.

1363
02:02:19,480 --> 02:02:23,240
Honestly, these share same place in my heart as with

1364
02:02:23,240 --> 02:02:26,160
those three word stories.

1365
02:02:26,160 --> 02:02:27,680
I think I should have lost it.

1366
02:02:27,680 --> 02:02:30,040
There was one that went on for like a whole page, and if you

1367
02:02:30,040 --> 02:02:33,200
think I'm reading it, you're freaking crazy.

1368
02:02:33,200 --> 02:02:35,120
I'll read one more here.

1369
02:02:35,120 --> 02:02:36,360
Let's see.

1370
02:02:39,360 --> 02:02:42,240
Yeah, this was Alex L. Dubes that recommended it, because

1371
02:02:42,240 --> 02:02:43,360
he made a post in here.

1372
02:02:43,360 --> 02:02:44,920
It says, DDR fairy tales.

1373
02:02:44,920 --> 02:02:46,080
Ooh, ooh, let me try.

1374
02:02:46,080 --> 02:02:48,240
There once was a village of people who had no life.

1375
02:02:48,240 --> 02:02:49,560
And what a surprise, there was a DDR

1376
02:02:49,560 --> 02:02:52,800
machine in the village.

1377
02:02:52,800 --> 02:02:54,440
That one's good.

1378
02:02:54,440 --> 02:02:56,280
You know what we need to actually do instead of the

1379
02:02:56,280 --> 02:02:56,880
fairy tales?

1380
02:02:56,880 --> 02:02:58,960
We need DDR limericks.

1381
02:02:58,960 --> 02:03:00,000
Dirty ones.

1382
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:01,720
Dirty DDR limericks?

1383
02:03:01,720 --> 02:03:02,880
Yeah.

1384
02:03:02,880 --> 02:03:04,840
Well, this one starts out, it might sound dirty.

1385
02:03:04,840 --> 02:03:06,080
Here's the last one I'm gonna read.

1386
02:03:06,080 --> 02:03:10,200
Once upon a time there was a man named Max, period.

1387
02:03:10,200 --> 02:03:12,800
He went up to a La Señorita.

1388
02:03:12,800 --> 02:03:14,800
Buenos dias, he helped.

1389
02:03:14,800 --> 02:03:20,800
I think Buenos dias should be a DDR song.

1390
02:03:20,800 --> 02:03:24,760
Buenos dias!

1391
02:03:24,760 --> 02:03:25,880
Oh my God.

1392
02:03:25,880 --> 02:03:30,600
They needed a Spanish version of Max.

1393
02:03:30,600 --> 02:03:31,000
What?

1394
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:32,600
They needed a Spanish version of Max.

1395
02:03:36,760 --> 02:03:37,440
I'm sorry.

1396
02:03:37,440 --> 02:03:38,640
He went up to a La Senorita.

1397
02:03:38,640 --> 02:03:40,200
Buenos dias, he yelled.

1398
02:03:40,200 --> 02:03:42,440
He then offered her some candy.

1399
02:03:42,440 --> 02:03:45,440
All of a sudden, in a wild rush, she began to scream,

1400
02:03:45,440 --> 02:03:46,840
waka, waka.

1401
02:03:46,840 --> 02:03:48,760
Max yelled, don't break down.

1402
02:03:48,760 --> 02:03:50,640
Wait a minute, she screamed.

1403
02:03:50,640 --> 02:03:52,360
You have broken my heart.

1404
02:03:52,360 --> 02:03:55,560
He then began to feel like he hit a dead end.

1405
02:03:55,560 --> 02:03:58,760
You've been cheating on me, huh, Max, period, she screamed.

1406
02:03:58,760 --> 02:04:01,080
I like to share my love, he responded.

1407
02:04:01,080 --> 02:04:02,880
Nothing gonna stop, he added.

1408
02:04:02,880 --> 02:04:05,320
She then said, make love to me.

1409
02:04:05,320 --> 02:04:07,660
The reflex took over and they banged.

1410
02:04:07,660 --> 02:04:09,040
The end of the century.

1411
02:04:10,800 --> 02:04:13,520
Okay, that one's good, that one's good.

1412
02:04:13,520 --> 02:04:16,020
That one wins a lack of angst for me.

1413
02:04:18,520 --> 02:04:21,000
The reflex took over and, well, they banged.

1414
02:04:21,920 --> 02:04:23,380
Buenos dias.

1415
02:04:23,380 --> 02:04:40,900
I love the way people write on DDR free. The reflex took over and you know they banged.

1416
02:04:40,900 --> 02:04:46,800
Did she bang? Comment from our chat room and VX JasonXV really wants me to read this because

1417
02:04:46,800 --> 02:04:52,460
he's posted it three times. I thought it was a fairy tale, not a retardation and bastardization

1418
02:04:52,460 --> 02:05:00,380
song titles come on jason buenos dias uh fairy tale get it because it's a song

1419
02:05:03,260 --> 02:05:04,060
let's go break

1420
02:05:06,780 --> 02:05:10,860
uh in this break we're gonna hear you know what now that i've uh said buenos

1421
02:05:12,860 --> 02:05:17,740
we gotta talk about something all right what um remember that we posted something about

1422
02:05:17,740 --> 02:05:22,060
Alright, what do you want to say about Karaoke Revolution?

1423
02:05:22,060 --> 02:05:26,620
There's that song from Dirty Dancing in it, and I'm scared because there's a Karaoke Revolution

1424
02:05:26,620 --> 02:05:27,780
4.

1425
02:05:27,780 --> 02:05:28,780
The end.

1426
02:05:28,780 --> 02:05:35,460
Okay, Karaoke Revolution is, they're gonna have, I had the time of my life.

1427
02:05:35,460 --> 02:05:38,860
I'm not gonna sing the whole thing, that's the most you're gonna get from me, but you

1428
02:05:38,860 --> 02:05:40,740
know that song.

1429
02:05:40,740 --> 02:05:44,340
Hopefully at E3 we'll get to see some Karaoke Revolution 4, and we'll make Loki play.

1430
02:05:44,340 --> 02:05:47,060
And hopefully at E3 we will not see Patrick Swayze.

1431
02:05:47,060 --> 02:05:52,300
Hopefully all right. We'll be back, but buenos dias has me in a mambo a go-go mood

1432
02:05:52,300 --> 02:05:56,380
So we're gonna play some mambo music this break, so we'll start it off with el bimbo

1433
02:05:56,380 --> 02:06:02,120
Buenos dias Max 300, buenos dias El Bimbo, we'll be back after this with more Orange

1434
02:06:02,120 --> 02:06:09,120
lounge.

1435
02:06:32,120 --> 02:06:36,120
The

1436
02:06:36,120 --> 02:06:40,120
The

1437
02:06:40,120 --> 02:06:44,120
The

1438
02:06:44,120 --> 02:06:48,120
The

1439
02:06:48,120 --> 02:06:52,120
The

1440
02:06:52,120 --> 02:06:56,120
The

1441
02:06:56,120 --> 02:07:00,120
The

1442
02:07:30,120 --> 02:07:31,120
Hey!

1443
02:07:31,120 --> 02:07:32,120
Hey!

1444
02:07:32,120 --> 02:07:33,120
Hey!

1445
02:07:33,120 --> 02:07:34,120
Hey!

1446
02:07:34,120 --> 02:07:35,120
Hey!

1447
02:07:35,120 --> 02:07:37,120
You

1448
02:08:35,120 --> 02:08:51,100
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, nine, nine, ten.

1449
02:09:51,100 --> 02:09:53,100
Oh

1450
02:10:51,100 --> 02:10:58,100
Why do you cry when you're happy, it's just something special

1451
02:10:58,100 --> 02:11:05,100
Why do you see what I don't see starting in the blue sky

1452
02:11:05,100 --> 02:11:09,100
It's just something special

1453
02:11:09,100 --> 02:11:12,100
Now that you see what I've done

1454
02:11:12,100 --> 02:11:17,100
Stay talking in the blue sky

1455
02:11:17,100 --> 02:11:20,100
There is so much to come

1456
02:11:20,100 --> 02:11:24,100
It's all a destination

1457
02:11:24,100 --> 02:11:27,100
And have a sip into a really deep

1458
02:11:27,100 --> 02:11:31,100
And you'll see that with the beer

1459
02:11:31,100 --> 02:11:33,100
Check, check, check

1460
02:11:33,100 --> 02:11:46,100
Check, one two check, check, check, one two check, check, check, one two check, check, check, one two check

1461
02:11:46,100 --> 02:11:52,400
Check, check, check, check, check, one two check, check, one two check, sound check check check

1462
02:11:54,200 --> 02:12:01,100
There is so much to hide in my collection

1463
02:12:01,100 --> 02:12:08,100
And have a seat in who I really think you'll be without me today

1464
02:12:10,100 --> 02:12:12,100
Are you with me all the way?

1465
02:12:13,100 --> 02:12:15,100
I'm happy today

1466
02:12:20,100 --> 02:12:24,100
For the best part of Orange Lab, this PDR sucks!

1467
02:12:25,100 --> 02:12:26,100
Holla!

1468
02:12:26,100 --> 02:12:27,100
Stop, stop, stop, stop!

1469
02:12:27,100 --> 02:12:28,100
We want to learn more!

1470
02:12:28,100 --> 02:12:29,100
That's right, PS!

1471
02:12:29,100 --> 02:12:42,100
Hi, we're back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 140 in progress, and we're

1472
02:12:42,100 --> 02:12:47,300
going to get into the FUs of the week relatively shortly, but first, I know we usually talk

1473
02:12:47,300 --> 02:12:50,900
about DDR a whole lot on this show, but we know you guys are into some other games too,

1474
02:12:50,900 --> 02:12:54,820
because you check out our podcast, which we talk about other games, and I know one game

1475
02:12:54,820 --> 02:12:59,780
series that Konami also does that's very popular is Silent Hill, and Jamie's going to give

1476
02:12:59,780 --> 02:13:02,580
us an update on something that's going on in the Silent Hill world.

1477
02:13:02,580 --> 02:13:09,420
Really, my updates are just from over the week. They've got the, you know, the basic

1478
02:13:09,420 --> 02:13:15,020
story of course has been out on the web for some time. They're in pre-production now.

1479
02:13:15,020 --> 02:13:17,580
For the Silent Hill movie, correct? Yes.

1480
02:13:17,580 --> 02:13:23,660
So far cast is Radha Mitchell from Finding Neverland. Sean Bean is in it as her character's

1481
02:13:23,660 --> 02:13:31,660
husband. For Lord of the Rings fans, he was Boromir. And then somebody named Jodelle Fairland

1482
02:13:31,660 --> 02:13:38,980
as the daughter in the movie. But they were saying in this one article, and I'll link

1483
02:13:38,980 --> 02:13:46,660
it in the chat room in just a moment, they had the production cost, I think it's expected

1484
02:13:46,660 --> 02:13:52,020
the top $25,000 per day during the shoot.

1485
02:13:52,020 --> 02:13:54,580
So it's going to be, of course, several million dollars

1486
02:13:54,580 --> 02:13:55,500
to produce this movie.

1487
02:13:55,500 --> 02:13:57,780
They've got big hopes for it.

1488
02:13:57,780 --> 02:13:59,260
There are pictures out on the net.

1489
02:13:59,260 --> 02:14:02,820
I'm trying to find the link I had that had, like, 60-some

1490
02:14:02,820 --> 02:14:04,140
odd pre-production picture.

1491
02:14:04,140 --> 02:14:06,020
There actually is a link on orangehelmsradio.com in the

1492
02:14:06,020 --> 02:14:08,340
story we ran earlier this week that has a link to it, if

1493
02:14:08,340 --> 02:14:09,980
it's still valid, which I think it is.

1494
02:14:09,980 --> 02:14:11,820
Actually, I do believe it is.

1495
02:14:11,820 --> 02:14:15,300
But I'm also going to copy this article for the chat room.

1496
02:14:15,300 --> 02:14:17,580
It's really good.

1497
02:14:17,580 --> 02:14:19,460
And it's talking about actually the town that they're

1498
02:14:19,460 --> 02:14:24,180
filming it in and how the people are reacting to it.

1499
02:14:24,180 --> 02:14:25,300
Very cool.

1500
02:14:25,300 --> 02:14:25,700
There it is.

1501
02:14:25,700 --> 02:14:27,740
I'm looking forward to that movie very much.

1502
02:14:27,740 --> 02:14:33,020
It should be, I'm hoping that they stay loyal to the games.

1503
02:14:33,020 --> 02:14:37,020
If they stay loyal to the games, it'll be so cool.

1504
02:14:37,020 --> 02:14:39,220
But if they try to do the Resident Evil thing, it's

1505
02:14:39,220 --> 02:14:40,020
going to suck.

1506
02:14:40,020 --> 02:14:42,060
So I really hope they don't turn it into like zombie

1507
02:14:42,060 --> 02:14:47,940
horror action film but you know kind of that subtle like mess with I think it's

1508
02:14:47,940 --> 02:14:52,940
gonna stay with the with the way the games are on I'm it I'm hopeful from the

1509
02:14:52,940 --> 02:14:56,420
pictures I mean it seemed like it's exactly the same because you know how in

1510
02:14:56,420 --> 02:15:04,560
the games everybody is linked to the whole rebirth thing you know this one

1511
02:15:04,560 --> 02:15:09,300
seems almost like it would be some like an innocent bystander just caught up in

1512
02:15:09,300 --> 02:15:14,700
what's going on from what I can tell it's looking pretty cool I'm hoping it

1513
02:15:14,700 --> 02:15:17,180
comes out soon I know it's not out so next year but you never know what might

1514
02:15:17,180 --> 02:15:22,500
happen I need this all right it's time for the F use the week boys and girls if

1515
02:15:22,500 --> 02:15:26,140
you want to send in an F you of the week send your private message to sky in the

1516
02:15:26,140 --> 02:15:29,540
chat room with whatever you want to give an F you to please keep them short as

1517
02:15:29,540 --> 02:15:32,620
we've got a lot of people that probably want to get their F use in if your F you

1518
02:15:32,620 --> 02:15:37,260
goes on and on non you will get cut off just like that we don't have to read

1519
02:15:37,260 --> 02:15:41,860
your f-you anyway but we will because we know you're angsty like us so dark

1520
02:15:41,860 --> 02:15:47,140
Sakura why is it that we do the F use of the week every single week and because

1521
02:15:47,140 --> 02:15:50,060
Jamie can't have chocolate

1522
02:15:50,060 --> 02:16:10,780
Fuck you to car accidents and all the shit that's happened to my car, god damn it.

1523
02:16:10,780 --> 02:16:14,920
You know, I loved my CD player even though it was a piece of shit.

1524
02:16:14,920 --> 02:16:18,880
And I loved my car even though it's also a piece of shit.

1525
02:16:18,880 --> 02:16:21,020
But I didn't need to be in the goddamn accident.

1526
02:16:21,020 --> 02:16:25,180
I certainly am tired of not being able to walk up a damn flight of stairs because my

1527
02:16:25,180 --> 02:16:27,820
hip hurts like in excruciating pain.

1528
02:16:27,820 --> 02:16:31,520
This is after Vicodin and Flexerol, so fuck the whole thing.

1529
02:16:31,520 --> 02:16:33,600
This is what I'm angsty about.

1530
02:16:33,600 --> 02:16:40,160
And also, I hate taking the medication anyway because it makes my head feel all funny.

1531
02:16:40,160 --> 02:16:44,300
And when my head feels funny, I tend to say weird things instead of just go off on people.

1532
02:16:44,300 --> 02:16:47,760
And I went off on people at work, and that's not good.

1533
02:16:47,760 --> 02:16:53,080
So I ended up going home because I went off on people.

1534
02:16:53,080 --> 02:16:54,780
I hate feeling like this.

1535
02:16:54,780 --> 02:16:56,900
I hate the crap that's happening in my car.

1536
02:16:56,900 --> 02:17:01,560
And honestly I wish that someone would just run into my car with a semi so that their

1537
02:17:01,560 --> 02:17:03,960
insurance would buy me a brand new fucking car.

1538
02:17:03,960 --> 02:17:08,920
I also F you to my apartment complex and the stupid bitch that manages it.

1539
02:17:08,920 --> 02:17:14,040
She doesn't do her job for shit and keeps letting these wannabe thug gangsters move

1540
02:17:14,040 --> 02:17:15,040
in next door.

1541
02:17:15,040 --> 02:17:17,320
And it's no longer a safe place to live.

1542
02:17:17,320 --> 02:17:22,680
I also fucking hate the stupid, uh, cost of houses in this, uh, state,

1543
02:17:23,080 --> 02:17:26,440
especially in Sacramento and the Bay area, of course, is a lot more expensive,

1544
02:17:26,880 --> 02:17:29,920
but it's hard to find a house for under $350,000.

1545
02:17:30,280 --> 02:17:31,240
And you know,

1546
02:17:31,240 --> 02:17:35,920
if we have to move out to Yuba city to freaking have a house that is worth a damn

1547
02:17:36,160 --> 02:17:37,360
and not have to, you know,

1548
02:17:37,760 --> 02:17:42,040
pay everything for the rest of our lives to have this house, then so be it,

1549
02:17:42,040 --> 02:17:46,600
you know, I'll put up with the extra drive, but I did find a cute house though,

1550
02:17:46,600 --> 02:17:53,560
but it's small and they want a bunch for it it's just a nightmare you know i fucking hate growing

1551
02:17:53,560 --> 02:17:59,240
up now even though it's gonna be nice to have a house oh life's gonna suck when you grow up

1552
02:17:59,240 --> 02:18:09,640
when you grow up when you grow up uh you know it's just all of you kids in the chat room you have no

1553
02:18:09,640 --> 02:18:15,240
right to complain about living with your parents because you don't have to pay for shit if i hear

1554
02:18:15,240 --> 02:18:18,920
Here you bitching one more time, I'm going to come to your house and slap you upside

1555
02:18:18,920 --> 02:18:19,920
of the head.

1556
02:18:19,920 --> 02:18:22,960
Unless you aren't paying the mortgage by yourself, then you can't bitch.

1557
02:18:22,960 --> 02:18:24,960
Or pay rent.

1558
02:18:24,960 --> 02:18:27,560
And even then, you can move out when you're fucking 18.

1559
02:18:27,560 --> 02:18:31,720
Although I don't recommend it, live with your parents as long as you can, milk them for

1560
02:18:31,720 --> 02:18:37,800
every cent they're worth, because it sucks when you have to do it all by yourself.

1561
02:18:37,800 --> 02:18:39,520
I'm done.

1562
02:18:39,520 --> 02:18:40,520
Loki.

1563
02:18:40,520 --> 02:18:47,520
Ahh, chocolate gooood.

1564
02:18:47,520 --> 02:18:52,520
No, anyways, now the chocolate's gone.

1565
02:18:52,520 --> 02:18:55,520
I need more chocolate! Now that!

1566
02:18:55,520 --> 02:19:05,520
Anyways, um, no, I was, um, I'm very pissed off at the fact of my weekends being, in general, too busy for me.

1567
02:19:05,520 --> 02:19:09,520
I don't even get a chance to actually relax during the whole weekend.

1568
02:19:09,520 --> 02:19:11,920
No, those are peanut butter cups. I hate peanut butter cups.

1569
02:19:11,920 --> 02:19:13,920
I like expensive chocolates.

1570
02:19:15,920 --> 02:19:16,820
Ugh...

1571
02:19:16,820 --> 02:19:20,120
I-I like non-expensive chocolates that used to be expensive.

1572
02:19:20,120 --> 02:19:21,820
Anyways, um...

1573
02:19:21,820 --> 02:19:25,120
So, fuck you to goddamn weekends being too damn long,

1574
02:19:25,120 --> 02:19:27,320
and fuck you to having to drive...

1575
02:19:29,020 --> 02:19:30,120
Just...

1576
02:19:30,120 --> 02:19:31,320
Stressful, okay?

1577
02:19:31,320 --> 02:19:32,120
Ooh!

1578
02:19:33,120 --> 02:19:34,620
Thank you!

1579
02:19:34,620 --> 02:19:36,220
I got more chocolates.

1580
02:19:36,220 --> 02:19:37,320
Um...

1581
02:19:37,320 --> 02:19:38,020
Anyway...

1582
02:19:38,020 --> 02:19:41,220
Fuck you to bad drivers, because they're everywhere.

1583
02:19:41,220 --> 02:19:45,460
Everywhere, everywhere. I was coming home from dropping off Rob yesterday,

1584
02:19:45,460 --> 02:19:49,580
and this guy is just passing me at like 50 miles an hour faster than where I'm going.

1585
02:19:49,580 --> 02:19:52,900
Granted, I'm going about 75 on the freeway.

1586
02:19:52,900 --> 02:19:56,660
He's just all, shoo! Like, all- No, I was in the car when that happened.

1587
02:19:56,660 --> 02:20:00,860
That guy was crazy. Yeah, I don't even know what that was. I mean, that was just nuts.

1588
02:20:00,860 --> 02:20:04,100
People, honestly, I mean, I see-

1589
02:20:04,100 --> 02:20:07,860
I'm going like, you know, 75 or something. I consider that pretty, you know,

1590
02:20:07,860 --> 02:20:12,820
um you know that's some pretty good speeding right there i mean you don't want to go crazy

1591
02:20:12,820 --> 02:20:17,380
because you know there's a lot of cars out there but there's people are zooming past me you know

1592
02:20:17,380 --> 02:20:22,660
just like nothing you know i don't understand why everyone's in such a hurry nowadays and it

1593
02:20:22,660 --> 02:20:28,740
was funny though today one person did just like a the same thing you know zoomed right past me

1594
02:20:28,740 --> 02:20:35,860
that cop car zoomed right past me and pulled the sucker over oh that was great um then um

1595
02:20:35,860 --> 02:20:43,820
Well, I was gonna say, um, fuck you to Live365 for not giving me more free crap.

1596
02:20:43,820 --> 02:20:48,300
I like free crap and all I got was a stupid t-shirt that I'm probably not gonna wear.

1597
02:20:48,300 --> 02:20:49,980
Last year we had a lot more free crap.

1598
02:20:49,980 --> 02:20:53,140
We got a lot more free crap last year, I was very disappointed at the lack of free crap

1599
02:20:53,140 --> 02:20:54,140
this year.

1600
02:20:54,140 --> 02:20:58,260
I'm just like, I'm trying to figure out why, what exactly cost the twenty, what am I getting

1601
02:20:58,260 --> 02:20:59,380
for this twenty dollars?

1602
02:20:59,380 --> 02:21:00,380
That's what I wanna know.

1603
02:21:00,380 --> 02:21:04,380
You got to see that girl sing those dirty ass lyrics about that guy being up all in

1604
02:21:04,380 --> 02:21:05,380
her.

1605
02:21:05,380 --> 02:21:12,380
Yeah, but I wasn't that guy all up in her, so it wasn't really, you know, worth the $20, that's what I'm trying to say.

1606
02:21:12,380 --> 02:21:17,380
If you'd gotten a chance to go up all in her, and she wrote that song about you, would it have been worth the $20?

1607
02:21:17,380 --> 02:21:19,380
That would have been worth the $20.

1608
02:21:19,380 --> 02:21:26,380
I got two things. One, I've got a bunch of free crap coming, you can have it. Three, I'll drop it in the toilet or something if you want.

1609
02:21:26,380 --> 02:21:34,380
Two, hold on, two, you guys have to pay to go to the awards, even though you are on the ballot, so to speak?

1610
02:21:34,380 --> 02:21:39,620
play a fun game lanky style let's play how much was each ticket no better yet

1611
02:21:39,620 --> 02:21:43,860
let's play how much did it cost for all three of us to go to the award ceremony

1612
02:21:43,860 --> 02:21:52,140
guess now hundred dollars less 75 less well this is no fun he's guessing hi I'm

1613
02:21:52,140 --> 02:21:56,520
including gasps okay no no oh well shit if you're gonna take just the tickets

1614
02:21:56,520 --> 02:22:02,160

1615
02:22:02,160 --> 02:22:09,740

02:22:09,740 --> 02:22:14,700

02:22:14,700 --> 02:22:19,140
jump onto with my PSP it was no password free but it wasn't let me connect for

1618
02:22:19,140 --> 02:22:22,420
some reason that pissed me off damn those protected internet because I

1619
02:22:22,420 --> 02:22:27,620
wanted to jump onto the chat room that was in the live 365 and write dirty

1620
02:22:27,620 --> 02:22:34,560
stuff but I couldn't do that and so that made me sad and then fuck you for to

1622
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:49,280

1625
02:22:57,240 --> 02:23:00,560
Hey, hey, you know they happen every now and then.

1626
02:23:00,560 --> 02:23:05,120
I guess for, uh, it's Chaos Theory.

1627
02:23:05,120 --> 02:23:06,760
Yep, exactly.

1628
02:23:06,760 --> 02:23:09,240
So there are the few, the select few.

1629
02:23:09,240 --> 02:23:11,560
Yeah, we, we love Comcast, we really do.

1630
02:23:11,560 --> 02:23:15,160
Please don't pull the plug, please don't pull the plug.

1631
02:23:15,160 --> 02:23:19,240
Oh, and um, um, also, um, fuck you, Zach B.

1632
02:23:19,240 --> 02:23:23,000
for just putting a picture of my leg.

1633
02:23:23,000 --> 02:23:25,160
And, uh, I can, I, I can understand, okay.

1634
02:23:25,160 --> 02:23:27,200
Be glad at least your leg got in there.

1635
02:23:27,200 --> 02:23:31,000
good shot, you know, it was an action shot, but you know, the next page they have a picture

1636
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:35,840
of Rob's face. I'm like, what about my face? No one knows what I look like. I am just a

1637
02:23:35,840 --> 02:23:42,120
floating leg. Well, it's semi-transparent, mind you. That just goes to prove I'm sexier.

1638
02:23:42,120 --> 02:23:45,760
I'm just kidding, I don't... Did you see the way I looked in that picture, though? I'm

1639
02:23:45,760 --> 02:23:48,400
like, eehh, I look like Corky. I don't know, it was just me or not, but he looked like

1640
02:23:48,400 --> 02:23:54,080
a freakin' sasquatch. I swear, he looked, his eyebrows looked, yeah, raw. No, no, it's just

1641
02:23:54,080 --> 02:23:58,580
I don't know what it was, but your eyebrows looked especially white in the picture, so you look like that.

1642
02:23:58,580 --> 02:24:00,580
I had big, bushy eyebrows.

1643
02:24:00,580 --> 02:24:05,580
You don't have, okay, for anybody who hasn't seen Rob, which I'm pretty sure all of our listeners...

1644
02:24:05,580 --> 02:24:08,580
Well, I'm on the cam right now, so it's dark as hell in here, so they can't see anything.

1645
02:24:08,580 --> 02:24:10,580
Like, you don't have white eyebrows.

1646
02:24:10,580 --> 02:24:13,580
I don't know what happened with that picture, but it looked like you seriously had no eyebrows,

1647
02:24:13,580 --> 02:24:15,580
because they looked like they were shaving off in that picture.

1648
02:24:15,580 --> 02:24:17,580
Well, maybe they had to photoshop me, because...

1649
02:24:17,580 --> 02:24:19,080
My hideous face!

1650
02:24:19,080 --> 02:24:22,580
They're like, this guy's actually better looking than most radio personalities.

1651
02:24:22,580 --> 02:24:24,580
We got to make him look bad

1652
02:24:27,860 --> 02:24:34,100
Using crime technology, we're gonna eat him to look like sasquatch moving on

1653
02:24:44,940 --> 02:24:49,900
An F you to the fact that moving out took me like three weeks to do but I'm very happy it's over now an F

1654
02:24:49,900 --> 02:24:53,140
to the fact that we probably won't get the deposit back because landlords are

1655
02:24:53,140 --> 02:24:56,900
cunts. Actually, our old landlords are pretty decent, I can't knock them, they

1656
02:24:56,900 --> 02:25:01,480
were decent, but we'll see if we get the deposit back or not. And I may be back

1657
02:25:01,480 --> 02:25:07,560
here in three weeks saying that they are bitches but we'll see, so...yeah if you did

1658
02:25:07,560 --> 02:25:11,540
that, and if you did the fact that I really don't feel like I had a vacation

1659
02:25:11,540 --> 02:25:14,620
even though I've had three days off of works I've had like a five-day weekend I

1660
02:25:14,620 --> 02:25:18,700
don't feel like I had a vacation at all. I'm so tired and I'm like, oh my god I

1661
02:25:18,700 --> 02:25:22,380
I have to go to work tomorrow life sucks. I hate being a grown-up. I hate it

1662
02:25:23,500 --> 02:25:26,780
Let's see what other people in our room have to say for the F use of the week

1663
02:25:26,780 --> 02:25:29,880
We'll start it off with where we gonna go Arcadia 42

1664
02:25:33,160 --> 02:25:35,680
Fuck you to my computer being old and slow and

1665
02:25:36,340 --> 02:25:43,100
Can't really afford a new one right now. Hopefully soon, but I put myself in more debt. I'm in right now. Oh

1666
02:25:43,100 --> 02:25:47,300
Oh well. And fuck you to the next week, because it's gonna be so low at work.

1667
02:25:47,300 --> 02:25:51,300
I'll be bored half the time. And, nah.

1668
02:25:51,300 --> 02:25:56,300
I get it. That's about it.

1669
02:25:56,300 --> 02:25:59,300
Ice Queen. That's Princess Bitch.

1670
02:25:59,300 --> 02:26:04,100
Whatever. You're the biggest queen of them all.

1671
02:26:04,100 --> 02:26:06,300
That's true.

1672
02:26:06,300 --> 02:26:11,100
I don't know. Sorry, somebody... Give the FUs! Stop screaming like a bitch.

1673
02:26:11,100 --> 02:26:15,780
okay fuck you to Toyota's for being pieces of shit and trying to rip me off

1674
02:26:15,780 --> 02:26:23,860

1677
02:26:32,160 --> 02:26:37,260

Okay, that's it.

02:26:42,020 --> 02:26:44,020
Angel.

1681
02:26:44,020 --> 02:26:48,020
I feed it online classes because they're boring, but hey, whatever, I'm getting my shit done.

1682
02:26:48,020 --> 02:26:50,020
So, um...

1683
02:26:50,020 --> 02:26:52,020
Yeah...

1684
02:26:52,020 --> 02:26:54,020
Work is... Okay.

1685
02:26:54,020 --> 02:26:56,020
Work is work. Um, I will shut up now. Bye-bye.

1686
02:26:56,020 --> 02:26:58,020
Alright. Lanky style.

1687
02:27:00,020 --> 02:27:04,020
Uh, just, uh, fuck you to people who don't take care of your cars, and you post them online, saying,

1688
02:27:04,020 --> 02:27:08,420
Oh, there's nothing wrong with it I swear and then you totally sound like a dipshit on the phone

1689
02:27:08,420 --> 02:27:12,860
Who doesn't know what the fuck you're talking about? I guess that should be a big red flag and make me wonder, you know, why?

1690
02:27:14,020 --> 02:27:17,980
so we go check out these cars and we're gonna go buy them and they're like

1691
02:27:18,460 --> 02:27:21,620
they don't change the oil for like 10,000 miles and

1692
02:27:22,260 --> 02:27:23,380
Yeah

1693
02:27:23,380 --> 02:27:25,380
People just don't know how to take care of their cars

1694
02:27:25,420 --> 02:27:27,420
We yeah

1695
02:27:27,420 --> 02:27:33,420
Loki supposed to change your oil. Yeah, you're not supposed to run the same oil in it for you know ever

1696
02:27:33,980 --> 02:27:36,380
Eventually, it gets pretty nasty doesn't do its job

1697
02:27:37,300 --> 02:27:39,300
Yeah, okay

1698
02:27:42,020 --> 02:27:44,380
Really yeah, remember when you got those tires

1699
02:27:52,180 --> 02:27:54,300
Yeah, you have to get your tires rotated you should I

1700
02:27:54,300 --> 02:27:56,300
I

1701
02:27:56,940 --> 02:28:00,740
Heard once like I heard this rumor that some cars you have to put air in your tires. Is that true?

1702
02:28:01,500 --> 02:28:07,140
Well, some of them actually have a totally solid Center like a cream filled. Oh like a Twinkie

1703
02:28:07,140 --> 02:28:10,900
Yeah, I think I have Twinkie tires. Yeah, you won't need to fill those with air

1704
02:28:15,140 --> 02:28:16,540
Twinkie

1705
02:28:16,540 --> 02:28:22,300
Honestly Twinkie tires with the best invention ever at least if you know, you're tired pull the flyer. Oh, yeah

1706
02:28:22,300 --> 02:28:24,300
Yeah! Twinkie filly!

1707
02:28:24,300 --> 02:28:26,300
Woohoo!

1708
02:28:26,300 --> 02:28:29,300
Mmm! I'm full of twinkie goodness.

1709
02:28:29,300 --> 02:28:31,300
This is a delicious flat.

1710
02:28:31,300 --> 02:28:34,300
Now I just need to make a deep fryer big enough so I can fry them whenever I'm done.

1711
02:28:34,300 --> 02:28:36,300
It reminds me of that one Spamusement.

1712
02:28:36,300 --> 02:28:39,300
Which, by the way, is the best online comic of all time, Spamusement.

1713
02:28:39,300 --> 02:28:40,300
Yeah, Spamuse is awesome.

1714
02:28:40,300 --> 02:28:42,300
Just hang up, don't listen to the show anymore.

1715
02:28:42,300 --> 02:28:44,300
It says something about, are you man enough for this?

1716
02:28:44,300 --> 02:28:47,300
And then it's like a deep-fried truck.

1717
02:28:47,300 --> 02:28:56,300
What was it like, I don't remember what it was, like, Dale Earnhardt Jr. on a flatbed with a fishing pole, deep fried with country gravy.

1718
02:28:58,300 --> 02:29:05,300
It was amusement. S-P-A-M-U-S-P. Spam-musement. Just take amusement and put SP on it.

1719
02:29:05,300 --> 02:29:05,800
Yeah.

1720
02:29:05,800 --> 02:29:07,300
Alright. Anyway, moving on.

1721
02:29:07,300 --> 02:29:08,300
Amusement SP.

1722
02:29:08,300 --> 02:29:11,300
DarkSakura, I have one more after you before we get to the chatroom, if yous.

1723
02:29:11,300 --> 02:29:15,220
just back to the the other thing I was saying before

1724
02:29:15,220 --> 02:29:19,020
for everybody who and this actually goes a lot broader

1725
02:29:19,020 --> 02:29:22,380
for all of you people who bitch about the situation you're in

1726
02:29:22,380 --> 02:29:27,740
fucking make a change you know who just do nothing but complain about it when there

1727
02:29:27,740 --> 02:29:30,780
are ways to make it better and then they don't do it

1728
02:29:30,780 --> 02:29:34,420
because it's effort or it'll rock the boat

1729
02:29:34,420 --> 02:29:39,660
or as a da da da stop bitching take control of your fucking life

1730
02:29:39,660 --> 02:29:44,780
I'm done. I actually forgot one more F.U. of myself.

1731
02:29:44,780 --> 02:29:49,980
F.U. to the fact that to go see the Lion King, it cost $75

1732
02:29:49,980 --> 02:29:53,420
to sit in the first tier. I was in the first balcony,

1733
02:29:53,420 --> 02:29:58,100
$75 seats, and for that price, you would expect that there would be some nudity.

1734
02:29:58,100 --> 02:30:01,540
And there was no nudity. Yo, nudity where? In the Lion King.

1735
02:30:01,540 --> 02:30:06,700
I don't think that's nudity. I was very upset at the lack of nudity in the Lion King

1736
02:30:06,700 --> 02:30:10,700
considering how much was paid unless it was uh what's his name uh the guy that did hairspray

1737
02:30:11,580 --> 02:30:16,300
if you did you liking well you know i realized that everybody brought their kids and they were

1738
02:30:16,300 --> 02:30:20,860
selling t-shirts that said baby's first musical stuff i wanted nudity were you hoping for simba's

1739
02:30:20,860 --> 02:30:28,460
shaved balls if nothing else or you know where or mufasa and whatever i wanted to see mufasa's

1740
02:30:28,460 --> 02:30:32,140
Mufasa. That's all. Mufasa's like, it's time to make a baby.

1741
02:30:35,580 --> 02:30:39,900
All right, Ice Queen, do you want one last F.U.? No, yes, no.

1742
02:30:41,500 --> 02:30:44,940
My last F.U. was to Effort because I heard Jamie's F.U.s and

1743
02:30:45,580 --> 02:30:50,620
fuck Effort. Screw that. I want to live and be rich and not have to move a freaking muscle.

1744
02:30:50,620 --> 02:30:54,700
I want to win the lottery and be just a complete leech on the side. You could be like that lady

1745
02:30:54,700 --> 02:30:55,700
in Florida.

1746
02:30:55,700 --> 02:30:56,700
That's my dream.

1747
02:30:56,700 --> 02:30:58,260
But see, there's a difference.

1748
02:30:58,260 --> 02:30:59,420
You're not complaining about it.

1749
02:30:59,420 --> 02:31:01,260
I'm talking about to the people who say, I live...

1750
02:31:01,260 --> 02:31:04,460
I was gonna say, I was just not complaining.

1751
02:31:04,460 --> 02:31:10,740
He doesn't call you at, you know, nine o'clock at night, my life sucks, what'd you do today?

1752
02:31:10,740 --> 02:31:13,500
Uh, nothing, I thought about paying a bill.

1753
02:31:13,500 --> 02:31:18,740
Now, I'm just talking about all the people who live with, who live with their parents

1754
02:31:18,740 --> 02:31:24,980
and say, oh my parents don't respect me, and they make me do this, and they're 30.

1755
02:31:26,020 --> 02:31:30,020
My parents bought me the old model SUV because they don't love me.

1756
02:31:30,020 --> 02:31:33,620
My parents want me to stop whoring out and go back to junior high.

1757
02:31:34,980 --> 02:31:38,660
My mom, my mommy yells at me, but I'm gonna go out and buy an iPod.

1758
02:31:40,260 --> 02:31:41,860
Let's go to the chat room, shall we?

1759
02:31:42,900 --> 02:31:45,300
Started off with Miklatov, and Miklatov says,

1760
02:31:45,300 --> 02:31:48,940
FU to not welcoming a cute boys advances because I suck

1761
02:31:48,940 --> 02:31:53,980
FU to being sick all week, FU to E3 being too far away and FU to general

1762
02:31:53,980 --> 02:31:54,620
boredom

1763
02:31:54,620 --> 02:31:58,260
Miklotov if you were here I would not be shunning your advances so you don't have to

1764
02:31:58,260 --> 02:31:58,920
worry about that

1765
02:31:58,920 --> 02:32:01,940
aww how nice are you. Illusion

1766
02:32:01,940 --> 02:32:05,500
says FU to a boring weekend that's it not angsty this week

1767
02:32:05,500 --> 02:32:09,420
oh and FU to about Schmidt for horribly depressing me by saying how significant

1768
02:32:09,420 --> 02:32:10,100
life is

1769
02:32:10,100 --> 02:32:13,260
and FU to the live 365 awards

1770
02:32:13,260 --> 02:32:20,260
You guys were O.L. Robbed. Get it? O.L.R. O.L. Robbed. Get it?

1771
02:32:22,220 --> 02:32:26,260
Zaku says, F you to the drunk tards in another apartment in my apartment complex

1772
02:32:26,260 --> 02:32:29,820
who thought that the place needed a more loud cowbell last night.

1773
02:32:29,820 --> 02:32:32,820
F you to having to work off the books to make a living

1774
02:32:32,820 --> 02:32:37,900
and F you to having to put off finding a summer job till after finals

1775
02:32:37,900 --> 02:32:42,980
when there probably won't be any good jobs left.

1776
02:32:42,980 --> 02:32:47,140
2005 says F you to this guy who keeps calling me and waking me up

1777
02:32:47,140 --> 02:32:50,580
dark lion xvi

1778
02:32:50,580 --> 02:32:54,360
says F you to spring valley high school for spending my cousin and his friend

1779
02:32:54,360 --> 02:32:59,020
just because they were victims of a gang fight my cousins the one who got hit in

1780
02:32:59,020 --> 02:33:00,100
the head with a hammer

1781
02:33:00,100 --> 02:33:04,380
and his friend saved his life yet they were not yet they were suspended and

1782
02:33:04,380 --> 02:33:06,140
were about to face expulsion

1783
02:33:06,140 --> 02:33:09,300
this is all over the local news and I hope they're embarrassed about it

1784
02:33:09,300 --> 02:33:14,060
Were they trying to reenact when Mario gets the- nevermind I don't wanna go there.

1785
02:33:14,060 --> 02:33:19,340
F-U to WY- WY- WY- WIN-LAS VEGAS, sorry, for being the most disappointing opening on the

1786
02:33:19,340 --> 02:33:20,340
strip.

1787
02:33:20,340 --> 02:33:22,780
Too many flowers on the inside and it's almost like the Bellagio.

1788
02:33:22,780 --> 02:33:25,520
The only good thing about that place is the damn poker room.

1789
02:33:25,520 --> 02:33:32,500
F-U to KVVU-Fox5 Las Vegas for misspelling my cousin's last name.

1790
02:33:32,500 --> 02:33:37,420
DarkTetsuya says, F-U to whatever was causing my loss of appetite about a week and a half

1791
02:33:37,420 --> 02:33:38,420
ago.

1792
02:33:38,420 --> 02:33:42,600
That would probably be Roseanne naked.

1793
02:33:42,600 --> 02:33:46,800
That's it! You guys are kinda not, not angsty tonight.

1794
02:33:46,800 --> 02:33:51,240
I thought I was plenty angsty. Well no, not you, you guys are, you guys are plenty

1795
02:33:51,240 --> 02:33:53,200
angsty, but I mean like the chat room.

1796
02:33:53,200 --> 02:33:56,400
They didn't vote and they weren't angsty. What's wrong with you guys?

1797
02:33:56,400 --> 02:33:59,800
I think we're background noise for a lot of people tonight.

1798
02:33:59,800 --> 02:34:03,640
I noticed, you know... They're watching Family Guy. Damn them. We should just

1799
02:34:03,640 --> 02:34:06,720
spoil it. No, we, we better not do that. Everybody dies!

1800
02:34:06,720 --> 02:34:11,060
Yeah, everybody dies, the boat sinks, sorry.

1801
02:34:11,060 --> 02:34:12,160
Peter and...

1802
02:34:12,160 --> 02:34:16,900
Suey's gay.

1803
02:34:16,900 --> 02:34:21,160
Peter and Lois have sex, multiple times.

1804
02:34:21,160 --> 02:34:24,680
Alright, we're gonna go to a quick break, then we're gonna come back and do some

1805
02:34:24,680 --> 02:34:28,560
Ask Orange Lounge. I know it's been a little while since we've given you guys an

1806
02:34:28,560 --> 02:34:30,360
opportunity to ask us questions,

1807
02:34:30,360 --> 02:34:34,400
but we've been gone a couple weeks, so we're back. So you're gonna Ask Orange Lounge,

1808
02:34:34,400 --> 02:34:39,220
So send a private message to Sky in the chatroom with any questions that you may have in this break

1809
02:34:39,700 --> 02:34:45,540
Because I got yelled at it for not playing it last break. We're gonna play from Papa music ago, huh? We're gonna play

1810
02:34:46,120 --> 02:34:48,280
You see honey, so we'll start off with that break

1811
02:34:48,280 --> 02:34:51,900
And we'll do some other pop music 12 stuff since we have it and it's new it's new

1812
02:34:51,900 --> 02:34:57,660
We'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio. Don't go anywhere.

1813
02:36:21,900 --> 02:36:24,900
Give me a lotta, too, lotta, too, lotta

1814
02:36:24,900 --> 02:36:28,900
Baby, baby

1815
02:39:58,900 --> 02:39:59,900
Whoa!

1816
02:39:59,900 --> 02:40:01,880
Whoa!

1817
02:40:01,880 --> 02:40:03,880
Whoa!

1818
02:40:03,880 --> 02:40:05,860
Whoa!

1819
02:40:05,860 --> 02:40:08,860
Whoa!

1820
02:40:08,860 --> 02:40:09,860
Whoa!

1821
02:40:09,860 --> 02:40:12,360
Whoa!

1822
02:40:12,360 --> 02:40:14,840
Whoa!

1823
02:40:14,840 --> 02:40:16,840
Whoa!

1824
02:40:16,840 --> 02:40:19,840
Whoa!

1825
02:40:19,840 --> 02:40:23,840
Whoa!

1826
02:40:23,840 --> 02:40:26,340
Whoa!

1827
02:40:26,340 --> 02:40:27,840
Whoa!

1828
02:40:27,840 --> 02:40:55,340
Thank you very much.

1829
02:42:57,840 --> 02:43:14,540
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio and as promised we're going to get into a little

1830
02:43:14,540 --> 02:43:15,540
bit of Ask Orange Lounge.

1831
02:43:15,540 --> 02:43:20,720
This is where you guys get to direct the future of the show by asking us questions about what

1832
02:43:20,720 --> 02:43:22,500
you would like to hear us talk about.

1833
02:43:22,500 --> 02:43:24,260
See we're interactive like that.

1834
02:43:24,260 --> 02:43:34,420
So here we go with some Ask Orange Lounge.

1835
02:43:34,420 --> 02:43:39,660
Let's Ask Orange Lounge, some stupid question, what will we find out this week on Orange

1836
02:43:39,660 --> 02:43:40,660
Lounge Radio?

1837
02:43:40,660 --> 02:43:46,080
It would be nice if I could concentrate, but the people in the kitchen are making so much

1838
02:43:46,080 --> 02:43:48,280
Goddamn noise that I can't think straight

1839
02:43:53,600 --> 02:43:56,640
Song or song number one. See I can't think straight today, uh

1840
02:43:57,280 --> 02:44:03,440
Jaded 2005 with question number one me and my girlfriend have never seen you guys's faces

1841
02:44:03,440 --> 02:44:05,440
What do you guys look like?

1842
02:44:09,160 --> 02:44:13,420
Folks from the kitchen saying they look like whores. Well, the question wasn't about the folks in the kitchen

1843
02:44:13,420 --> 02:44:23,580
it's about us in here. What do we look like? We're damn sexy! There's pictures of us online.

1844
02:44:23,580 --> 02:44:35,780
I look like Tom Cruise, and Matt looks like Matt Damon, and Dark Sakura looks like Angelina

1845
02:44:35,780 --> 02:44:41,980
Jolie, just like her. I'm making stuff up so that they can fantasize. Well at least

1846
02:44:41,980 --> 02:44:47,980
What does it look like a freakin' toothpick like Nicole Kidman's turned herself into, anorexic?

1847
02:44:47,980 --> 02:44:52,980
Um, actually, if you guys want to see our pictures, we do have a picture gallery if you're a registered user of orangeisontrated.com.

1848
02:44:52,980 --> 02:44:59,980
But we don't spam you, there's no reason not to sign up. Just head on over and you'll see the picture galleries and you can actually see pictures of us at E3.

1849
02:44:59,980 --> 02:45:08,980
So there's like plenty of pictures there from last year's E3. Even Jamie, who's typically camera shy, can be seen in those pictures if you know where to look.

1850
02:45:08,980 --> 02:45:11,580
Alright, question number two from Allusion.

1851
02:45:11,580 --> 02:45:14,980
Allusion would like to know, and perhaps Jamie you can answer this one for Allusion.

1852
02:45:14,980 --> 02:45:18,380
Allusion would like to know, why do women have breasts?

1853
02:45:19,980 --> 02:45:23,780
Genetically to provide sustenance for the child.

1854
02:45:25,380 --> 02:45:28,180
And to bring home a paycheck at the end of the day.

1855
02:45:29,780 --> 02:45:30,580
Stop.

1856
02:45:31,180 --> 02:45:33,580
It's for feeding babies.

1857
02:45:33,780 --> 02:45:35,180
It is for feeding babies.

1858
02:45:35,180 --> 02:45:39,100
and for entertaining four year old men who pay enough

1859
02:45:39,100 --> 02:45:42,300
just shut up

1860
02:45:42,300 --> 02:45:49,300
and sometimes kittens because I saw that once on a Japanese TV show

1861
02:45:51,620 --> 02:45:56,220
okay moving on

1862
02:45:56,220 --> 02:46:00,540
yeah they just say breast milk is best only on this show would somebody ask that

1863
02:46:00,540 --> 02:46:02,220
question why do women have boobies

1864
02:46:02,220 --> 02:46:05,820
Hey, ask your mama. Dear Orange Lounge,

1865
02:46:05,820 --> 02:46:09,780
what's sex? Why do I have a pee pee?

1866
02:46:09,780 --> 02:46:14,340
Mikotov would like to know

1867
02:46:14,340 --> 02:46:17,660
what are you most looking forward to at E3 this year?

1868
02:46:17,660 --> 02:46:21,860
Uh, Loki. Sleeping.

1869
02:46:21,860 --> 02:46:25,700
You're just gonna sleep through E3?

1870
02:46:25,700 --> 02:46:30,740
Sleeping after walking around during E3? Oh, I see.

1871
02:46:30,740 --> 02:46:32,580
Honestly, you get tired.

1872
02:46:32,580 --> 02:46:35,080
No, but, um, what I wanna see...

1873
02:46:35,080 --> 02:46:37,580
I wanna see Sinbad being ignored again.

1874
02:46:37,580 --> 02:46:42,180
Tell the Sinbad story for those new listeners.

1875
02:46:42,180 --> 02:46:46,680
We saw Sinbad at E3 last year and he waved and, like, no one cared.

1876
02:46:46,680 --> 02:46:47,740
Everyone was just like,

1877
02:46:47,740 --> 02:46:49,340
Who's that guy? Who's that guy?

1878
02:46:49,340 --> 02:46:51,540
It's Sinbad.

1879
02:46:51,540 --> 02:46:53,780
Oh. He's not funny. Poor guy.

1880
02:46:53,780 --> 02:46:55,520
Say, look at me!

1881
02:46:55,520 --> 02:46:57,120
Hi!

1882
02:46:57,120 --> 02:46:58,160
Hi?

1883
02:46:58,160 --> 02:46:59,440
Hi?

1884
02:46:59,440 --> 02:47:03,840
Oh, poor Sinbad.

1885
02:47:03,840 --> 02:47:07,320
Well, what I'm most looking forward to at E3 this year is

1886
02:47:07,320 --> 02:47:10,160
the fact that there's going to be DDR with Mario.

1887
02:47:10,160 --> 02:47:12,360
I think that's going to be a fun game to check out.

1888
02:47:12,360 --> 02:47:15,360
And I'm also looking forward to seeing what Nintendo turns

1889
02:47:15,360 --> 02:47:17,520
out with the new Zelda and possibly a new console,

1890
02:47:17,520 --> 02:47:18,420
possibly.

1891
02:47:18,420 --> 02:47:21,640
And I'm looking forward to actually seeing progress on

1892
02:47:21,640 --> 02:47:22,720
the Nintendo DS.

1893
02:47:22,720 --> 02:47:24,880
I'm looking forward to that as well.

1894
02:47:24,880 --> 02:47:25,560
Dark Sakura.

1895
02:47:25,560 --> 02:47:28,800
I'm looking forward to ogling over the Marines.

1896
02:47:28,800 --> 02:47:30,840
There will be lots of men in uniform.

1897
02:47:30,840 --> 02:47:34,700
I'm expecting, I'm hoping this year with metrosexuality

1898
02:47:34,700 --> 02:47:38,360
pushing more and more, as much as that word is stupid, pushing more and more into our culture,

1899
02:47:38,360 --> 02:47:41,660
I'm looking for booth boys this year

1900
02:47:41,660 --> 02:47:45,040
instead of booth babes. I want some booth boys this year.

1901
02:47:45,040 --> 02:47:49,120
When I say boys, 18 and over please. With the general demographic of being

1902
02:47:49,120 --> 02:47:52,640
neri,

1903
02:47:52,640 --> 02:47:57,000
you know, late twenties. That's starting to be more and more bullshit though.

1904
02:47:57,000 --> 02:48:00,080
women are started to play games more and more and more more more

1905
02:48:00,080 --> 02:48:03,960
I mean that's been a long time coming right next thing you know they'll want to vote

1906
02:48:03,960 --> 02:48:08,920
okay um honestly this is your cue to tear into them

1907
02:48:08,920 --> 02:48:12,840
repeat please

1908
02:48:12,840 --> 02:48:15,840
I can't ignore what he says

1909
02:48:15,840 --> 02:48:18,840
allow me to repeat he said next thing you know

1910
02:48:18,840 --> 02:48:24,040
they'll want to vote the ferrets haven't been unpacked yet sorry

1911
02:48:24,040 --> 02:48:26,040
Oh shit.

1912
02:48:26,040 --> 02:48:27,040
Oh, in fact, actually...

1913
02:48:27,040 --> 02:48:28,040
That's more real on the floor.

1914
02:48:28,040 --> 02:48:30,040
While you're at it, while you're at it, uh,

1915
02:48:30,040 --> 02:48:33,040
Illusion had the answer to his question from earlier,

1916
02:48:33,040 --> 02:48:35,040
why do women have breasts?

1917
02:48:35,040 --> 02:48:37,040
He sent another message that says,

1918
02:48:37,040 --> 02:48:38,040
the correct answer was,

1919
02:48:38,040 --> 02:48:41,040
so you got something to look at when you're talking to them.

1920
02:48:45,040 --> 02:48:46,040
Where's the webcam?

1921
02:48:46,040 --> 02:48:49,040
The webcam's over there, but it's very dark.

1922
02:48:49,040 --> 02:48:50,040
Fuck.

1923
02:48:50,040 --> 02:48:53,040
I'm up here, not down there, now go away.

1924
02:48:53,040 --> 02:48:56,040
That's it, mastectomy.

1925
02:48:56,040 --> 02:48:59,400
And some women aren't just

1926
02:48:59,400 --> 02:49:02,720
not up here and not down there, they're down a little bit lower.

1927
02:49:02,720 --> 02:49:06,400
Those are people in their 60s.

1928
02:49:06,400 --> 02:49:11,600
I don't look at grandma's breasts. That is the result of bra burning in the 70s.

1929
02:49:11,600 --> 02:49:16,200
Honestly, yeah. What was the point of that?

1930
02:49:16,200 --> 02:49:20,240
I mean, honestly, we aren't going to be considered by bras.

1931
02:49:20,240 --> 02:49:27,520
oh yeah because they saw that as a symbol of of you know men keeping their

1932
02:49:27,520 --> 02:49:31,520
fit on women but the whole thing bras are there to support your boobs so you're

1933
02:49:31,520 --> 02:49:36,040
not saggy yeah I know some men that like to wear bras they're like they're like

1934
02:49:36,040 --> 02:49:47,240
got to know they won't hold us back now spray us with that hose oh anyways I

1935
02:49:47,240 --> 02:49:52,240
I gotta play the, you know, the sexist role on this show, you know, it's, it's...

1936
02:49:52,240 --> 02:49:56,240
Oh, right, alright, the role, the, the role that you fit into.

1937
02:49:56,240 --> 02:50:02,240
Okay, honestly, I've been talking to, you know, my fiancé, and she says that women are not bad drivers.

1938
02:50:02,240 --> 02:50:10,240
But every time I see a goddamn, you know, crazy bitch on the road, it's always some stupid woman on her cellphone, driving an SUV.

1939
02:50:10,240 --> 02:50:13,240
I can't help it if they keep her graduated stereotype.

1940
02:50:13,240 --> 02:50:19,000
I got stuck behind an old man driving an SUV talking on his cell phone.

1941
02:50:19,000 --> 02:50:21,440
Exactly. They fall into the old people category.

1942
02:50:21,440 --> 02:50:23,440
Was he burning his bra?

1943
02:50:23,440 --> 02:50:25,940
He was burning his pampers.

1944
02:50:25,940 --> 02:50:29,240
I don't know. Whatever it is, the old man wear depends.

1945
02:50:29,240 --> 02:50:31,840
Old men are nasty.

1946
02:50:31,840 --> 02:50:36,440
By the way, my new roommate is looking in on the room right now,

1947
02:50:36,440 --> 02:50:39,240
kind of going, what the hell are these people doing right now?

1948
02:50:39,240 --> 02:50:41,240
Can we interview you, please? Please?

1949
02:50:41,240 --> 02:50:42,540
Come be, give him a microphone.

1950
02:50:42,540 --> 02:50:45,540
Don't you agree with mint-sucky driving?

1951
02:50:45,540 --> 02:50:46,440
This is my new roommate.

1952
02:50:46,440 --> 02:50:46,940
Say hello.

1953
02:50:46,940 --> 02:50:47,440
Hello.

1954
02:50:47,440 --> 02:50:50,840
And now you, how much DDR do you play?

1955
02:50:50,840 --> 02:50:53,000
How familiar are you with DDR?

1956
02:50:53,000 --> 02:50:58,120
Well, I just played the game that my sister bought the other week.

1957
02:50:58,120 --> 02:51:01,320
Which is DDR Extreme on PS2.

1958
02:51:01,320 --> 02:51:02,320
And it was fun.

1959
02:51:02,320 --> 02:51:04,680
What do you think about the fact that your roommate does

1960
02:51:04,680 --> 02:51:06,660
this crazy internet radio program?

1961
02:51:06,660 --> 02:51:11,040
It's craziness with capital K.

1962
02:51:11,040 --> 02:51:15,600
No I think it's cool. This is the first time I've seen you do it so it's cool.

1963
02:51:15,600 --> 02:51:17,040
Are we nerds or what?

1964
02:51:17,040 --> 02:51:18,880
Um, you're crazy nerds.

1965
02:51:18,880 --> 02:51:22,560
I like that you're entertaining the guests out in the kitchen who have long since abandoned the show.

1966
02:51:22,560 --> 02:51:23,760
So that's cool.

1967
02:51:23,760 --> 02:51:25,840
Now tell them to keep it down out there. We're trying to do a show in here.

1968
02:51:25,840 --> 02:51:28,560
Keep it down. Oh okay I'll go that way.

1969
02:51:28,560 --> 02:51:33,520
Whoa what the hell was that noise? That was weird. Anyway sorry it must be interference.

1970
02:51:34,480 --> 02:51:35,120
Whoa okay.

1971
02:51:35,920 --> 02:51:36,480
Okay.

1972
02:51:36,480 --> 02:51:37,200
All right well.

1973
02:51:37,200 --> 02:51:38,400
All right well nice seeing you.

1974
02:51:38,400 --> 02:51:41,320
Okay, get out of the room that you pay rent for. No, I'm just kidding

1975
02:51:41,900 --> 02:51:43,900
No, but honestly, I

1976
02:51:44,740 --> 02:51:49,980
Mean there are like I said, there are the slight few just like good Comcast cable, you know

1977
02:51:49,980 --> 02:51:55,740
I said well when said the slight few people don't pull out in front of me in their taxi van

1978
02:51:56,420 --> 02:51:58,900
Exactly. I think that this guy I was like

1979
02:51:59,500 --> 02:52:04,820
And I ended up having to swim into the other lane and then I slid because of the freaking you know

1980
02:52:04,820 --> 02:52:08,860
rain you know everyone knows the taxi drivers I've actually wanted to do that

1981
02:52:08,860 --> 02:52:11,940
instead of actually honking my horn rolling down the window and sticking my

1982
02:52:11,940 --> 02:52:15,180
head out and yelling beep beep because I think people would notice me more than

1983
02:52:15,180 --> 02:52:25,340
as you hit something in your head is taking your left arm out extend your

1984
02:52:25,340 --> 02:52:31,940
middle finger up anyways we totally like sidestep whatever that question was

1985
02:52:31,940 --> 02:52:34,340
I'm going to post pictures of my car in the chatroom.

1986
02:52:34,340 --> 02:52:36,260
Nintz has a question.

1987
02:52:36,260 --> 02:52:38,380
Nintz says he's kind of stretching for a question here.

1988
02:52:38,380 --> 02:52:39,880
Skip it if you've got a better one.

1989
02:52:39,880 --> 02:52:40,900
Well, we don't.

1990
02:52:40,900 --> 02:52:43,100
I'm going to be getting another 2DX game soon.

1991
02:52:43,100 --> 02:52:45,540
So seventh style or eighth style?

1992
02:52:45,540 --> 02:52:46,780
Eighth.

1993
02:52:46,780 --> 02:52:49,140
Eighth.

1994
02:52:49,140 --> 02:52:51,140
I say seventh.

1995
02:52:51,140 --> 02:52:53,620
That's actually a toss-up, because I like what's on seventh.

1996
02:52:53,620 --> 02:52:57,380
But I really like what's on eighth, so.

1997
02:52:57,380 --> 02:52:58,220
Get sixth.

1998
02:52:58,220 --> 02:53:00,420
Eighth.

1999
02:53:00,420 --> 02:53:01,220
I like seventh.

2000
02:53:01,220 --> 02:53:02,520
I'm going to be the lone holdup for 7th.

2001
02:53:02,520 --> 02:53:04,740
Although, honestly, in 8th style, you get a lot of the

2002
02:53:04,740 --> 02:53:05,780
good 7th style songs.

2003
02:53:05,780 --> 02:53:08,380
But, but, but, but, beauty of silence, sound of goodbye.

2004
02:53:08,380 --> 02:53:12,400
But, but, but, you know, that's just me.

2005
02:53:12,400 --> 02:53:15,660
I don't play 2DX.

2006
02:53:15,660 --> 02:53:17,580
Lastly, a question, because we didn't get

2007
02:53:17,580 --> 02:53:18,380
any more other than this.

2008
02:53:18,380 --> 02:53:19,700
Legend of Zaku has this.

2009
02:53:19,700 --> 02:53:21,140
Oh, this is beautiful.

2010
02:53:21,140 --> 02:53:23,500
After stumbling through the Aaron and Japan forums, I

2011
02:53:23,500 --> 02:53:26,420
managed to find a thread that has what appears to be a link

2012
02:53:26,420 --> 02:53:30,020
for a DDR movie in production.

2013
02:53:30,020 --> 02:53:33,580
Here's the link of the story since the main site is down and then he gave a link here.

2014
02:53:33,580 --> 02:53:36,980
What chances do you give this so-called movie in the works? So I looked at the

2015
02:53:36,980 --> 02:53:38,180
link he gave you. Here it is.

2016
02:53:38,180 --> 02:53:42,140
Dance Dance Revolution is the name of the popular video game created by the well-known

2017
02:53:42,140 --> 02:53:43,520
game company Konami.

2018
02:53:43,520 --> 02:53:47,740
The current team consists... Okay, right there, you know it's a fake.

2019
02:53:47,740 --> 02:53:50,920
You can tell right... What is wrong with the first sentence that makes this a fake?

2020
02:53:50,920 --> 02:53:54,940
Konami. It's not Konami.

2021
02:53:54,940 --> 02:53:58,600
Oh. What? It says well-known game company Konami.

2022
02:53:58,600 --> 02:54:02,040
Konami does much more than just video games. Much, much more than just video games.

2023
02:54:02,040 --> 02:54:03,880
Remember? They create slot machines.

2024
02:54:03,880 --> 02:54:06,600
Well, yeah, but primarily they're known for the video games.

2025
02:54:06,600 --> 02:54:10,360
But I'm saying if this were an official press release, that wouldn't say that. I don't think.

2026
02:54:10,360 --> 02:54:12,200
It would say something like game publishers or something like that.

2027
02:54:12,200 --> 02:54:13,880
Either that or these people are just stupid.

2028
02:54:13,880 --> 02:54:17,640
The current team consists of two members so far, and I'm not even going to read their names.

2029
02:54:18,200 --> 02:54:20,600
Creator and directors. Two guys I've never heard of.

2030
02:54:20,600 --> 02:54:23,640
We started Dance Dance Revolution the movie in 2005.

2031
02:54:23,640 --> 02:54:29,000
All righty then, time for the storyline. 18-year-old Emi Toshiba's lifelong dream

2032
02:54:29,000 --> 02:54:32,960
was to become a professional dancer. One day she sees a flyer on a liquor store's

2033
02:54:32,960 --> 02:54:36,200
window announcing a dance contest. As she runs for the big-time winner with her

2034
02:54:36,200 --> 02:54:40,240
partner Rage, they meet some new friends, rivals, and conflicts. As Emi is settling

2035
02:54:40,240 --> 02:54:43,600
into her new surroundings, she and her new friends gradually become aware that

2036
02:54:43,600 --> 02:54:48,200
not all is quite right in the contest. Something sinister is lurking deep in

2037
02:54:48,200 --> 02:54:52,380
the shadows of the dancing stage. The movie is all about competition, love, and

2038
02:54:52,380 --> 02:54:55,440
accepting others as they are so if you like drama comedy and DDR this is the

2039
02:54:55,440 --> 02:55:00,220
movie for you the plans we're gonna produce the movie in 2007 or 2008

2040
02:55:00,220 --> 02:55:04,460
depending on when we'll get enough money for the production depending on when we

2041
02:55:04,460 --> 02:55:09,660
graduate from college you know it's not gonna happen that's like a plot of maybe

2042
02:55:09,660 --> 02:55:17,140
an anime for it it sounds like any of rage liquor store

2043
02:55:17,140 --> 02:55:18,500
I'd love to be a dancer!

2044
02:55:18,500 --> 02:55:23,860
Ami, by the way, is gonna be played by a big-breasted Asian chick in order to sell tickets.

2045
02:55:23,860 --> 02:55:24,500
I'll watch it.

2046
02:55:24,500 --> 02:55:28,900
Honestly, I don't care what it's about, you can just get...

2047
02:55:28,900 --> 02:55:32,740
Get that chick from BMX XXX, the one that

2048
02:55:32,740 --> 02:55:37,300
strips down naked and is dressed up like a schoolgirl, that'll get me to see that movie.

2049
02:55:37,300 --> 02:55:41,460
That's all you need to show is her dressed up like a schoolgirl stripping down naked

2050
02:55:41,460 --> 02:55:44,980
in the trailer that will sell tickets.

2051
02:55:44,980 --> 02:55:48,740
Hell, they should just make BMX XXX the movie. That would be better.

2052
02:55:48,740 --> 02:55:53,540
Every six months, the topic of DDR the movie is coming up.

2053
02:55:53,540 --> 02:55:56,740
Stop believing it!

2054
02:55:56,740 --> 02:56:01,700
There's only one way this will happen. Until it is posted on IMDB or

2055
02:56:01,700 --> 02:56:03,020
announced by a

2056
02:56:03,020 --> 02:56:06,500
resp... what's the word? Reputable? Respectable?

2057
02:56:06,500 --> 02:56:09,980
I don't know. Reputable has a reputation, right?

2058
02:56:09,980 --> 02:56:14,780
One of the big five movie productions. You know who's gonna do this? Even if it's Lionsgate!

2059
02:56:14,780 --> 02:56:18,420
wait for them to announce it you know who's gonna know why he's all bad

2060
02:56:18,420 --> 02:56:22,200
you know I don't know why I'm not gonna know I am is I'm just gonna say I'm you

2061
02:56:22,200 --> 02:56:23,180
know who would

2062
02:56:23,180 --> 02:56:27,460
you would you know steep this no soup this low

2063
02:56:27,460 --> 02:56:32,260
mmm evil he would

2064
02:56:32,260 --> 02:56:35,460
he would do this because he is like ooh

2065
02:56:35,460 --> 02:56:38,460
excuse to have another rave on an island

2066
02:56:38,460 --> 02:56:42,660
that movie was so bad

2067
02:56:42,660 --> 02:56:46,660
Didn't we talk a long time ago about possible plots for a DDR movie and we actually came

2068
02:56:46,660 --> 02:56:47,660
up with something decent?

2069
02:56:47,660 --> 02:56:49,660
I just don't remember what it was.

2070
02:56:49,660 --> 02:56:51,660
I know that's very useful to you guys out there.

2071
02:56:51,660 --> 02:56:52,660
10k commotion.

2072
02:56:52,660 --> 02:56:55,580
Oh god, don't start on that again.

2073
02:56:55,580 --> 02:56:57,020
That's another fanboy thing though.

2074
02:56:57,020 --> 02:56:59,820
I mean with all due respect to the folks that created it.

2075
02:56:59,820 --> 02:57:00,820
Come on.

2076
02:57:00,820 --> 02:57:01,900
But here's the thing though.

2077
02:57:01,900 --> 02:57:06,240
That's the only way that it would work and the whole focus of it is not really on DDR.

2078
02:57:06,240 --> 02:57:10,260
They play DDR in it but it's not really, that's not really the focus of it.

2079
02:57:10,260 --> 02:57:15,860
I like the setup that they do for like the tournament. The tournament setup was kind of cool. It made it look cool

2080
02:57:15,860 --> 02:57:17,940
That's that's the only way that we would work

2081
02:57:18,180 --> 02:57:22,960
None of this like because I I sense where they're going at this we're gonna use the DDR

2082
02:57:23,180 --> 02:57:26,780
Characters and they're gonna discover evil robots and yeah

2083
02:57:27,500 --> 02:57:28,780
No

2084
02:57:28,780 --> 02:57:35,740
They're secret agents and then rage is played by Jean-Claude Van Damme and all hell breaks loose

2085
02:57:35,740 --> 02:57:42,740
Please support TDR Edition.

2086
02:57:42,740 --> 02:57:46,740
We'll resurrect Raul Julian and kill him off again.

2087
02:57:46,740 --> 02:57:50,740
I think now would be a good time to end Ask Orange Lounge. What do you guys think?

2088
02:57:50,740 --> 02:57:53,740
I think not.

2089
02:57:53,740 --> 02:57:59,740
Actually I'm being linked to something in the channel. It is something that's on the Internet Movie Database.

2090
02:57:59,740 --> 02:58:02,740
Let's see, I think this is what I think it is.

2091
02:58:02,740 --> 02:58:10,100
link right now. It's in the chat. Yeah, Dance Dance Documentary. I don't know. It's something

2092
02:58:10,100 --> 02:58:20,700
that folks... What is this? It's a DVD. It's a documentary. Eh, big deal. I mean, no offense.

2093
02:58:20,700 --> 02:58:24,220
I think I was in one of these. I got interviewed for one of these. They wanted me to wear the

2094
02:58:24,220 --> 02:58:27,600
Dr. Dick hat, the orange hat, and I wouldn't do it because I knew it was being made for

2095
02:58:27,600 --> 02:58:31,960
a movie. I don't know if that's the one or if it was some other college project or something.

2096
02:58:31,960 --> 02:58:35,120
there was a call for the clatter

2097
02:58:35,120 --> 02:58:39,360
this isn't the same thing documentaries are one thing documentaries uh... you

2098
02:58:39,360 --> 02:58:43,880
know a lot of people unfortunately don't see it's a lot of projects that you know

2099
02:58:43,880 --> 02:58:47,920
i'm sure they're fine films but you know we're talking about like a fiction type

2100
02:58:47,920 --> 02:58:48,940
a big budget

2101
02:58:48,940 --> 02:58:49,640
basically

2102
02:58:49,640 --> 02:58:50,720
movie here

2103
02:58:50,720 --> 02:58:54,160
even a million dollars to be found out the game was going to actually be here's

2104
02:58:54,160 --> 02:58:57,240
the problem with this whole uh... movie idea

2105
02:58:57,240 --> 02:58:58,440
maybe like

2106
02:58:58,440 --> 02:58:59,920
you know i

2107
02:58:59,920 --> 02:59:01,040
fan movie

2108
02:59:01,040 --> 02:59:19,040
possibly. Big budget movie? No, because even if it was, you know, even if DDR is like uber popular, it doesn't lend itself to a movie at all, and you can't make a movie. That's like Tetris the movie, and I know everyone likes playing that, you know, joking about that. It's impossible.

2109
02:59:19,040 --> 02:59:26,040
You have to make a movie where DDR is an element, but not the main force behind it.

2110
02:59:26,040 --> 02:59:32,040
Like, you could do a, I don't know, a buddy movie that somehow has DDR, like they go, they like to play DDR.

2111
02:59:32,040 --> 02:59:34,040
Example. Here's an example.

2112
02:59:34,040 --> 02:59:36,040
The Wizard.

2113
02:59:36,040 --> 02:59:37,040
That's not an intentional-

2114
02:59:37,040 --> 02:59:38,040
The Wizard was gay.

2115
02:59:38,040 --> 02:59:39,040
Okay, that's not an-

2116
02:59:39,040 --> 02:59:40,040
Hey!

2117
02:59:40,040 --> 02:59:43,040
Okay, now that movie was good in the 80s.

2118
02:59:43,040 --> 02:59:45,040
It's so bad.

2119
02:59:45,040 --> 02:59:46,040
It did have Christian Slater.

2120
02:59:46,040 --> 03:00:08,520
Okay, now granted, now that's the only way that this type of thing would work is where it's like an element of it, you know, but that's not the main storyline, you know, it's not just, oh, look at us, we're playing DDR all the time. I mean, like the wizard, they had some more crap, like that stupid kid like, California. I hated him. But yeah, something like that.

2121
03:00:08,520 --> 03:00:09,480
And then they have the power glove.

2122
03:00:10,240 --> 03:00:10,760
So bad.

2123
03:00:10,800 --> 03:00:11,040
Yeah.

2124
03:00:11,040 --> 03:00:17,040
That's the end of another fabulous episode of Orange Lounge Radio, boys and girls.

2125
03:00:17,040 --> 03:00:21,040
Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts, starting with Angel.

2126
03:00:21,040 --> 03:00:23,040
Angel, your final thought.

2127
03:00:23,040 --> 03:00:26,040
I've been too quiet this episode, I'm sorry.

2128
03:00:26,040 --> 03:00:30,040
That's okay. Arcadian 42, your final thought.

2129
03:00:30,040 --> 03:00:32,040
I'm gonna...

2130
03:00:32,040 --> 03:00:34,040
Loki, your final thought.

2131
03:00:34,040 --> 03:00:38,040
I'm not sexist or racist, I just play one on the radio.

2132
03:00:38,040 --> 03:00:48,280
my final thought is air dark Sakura reject false icons and move out of your

2133
03:00:48,280 --> 03:00:56,560
parents house and the final word of tonight's show goes to Loki

2134
03:00:59,680 --> 03:01:06,760
that does it for another episode of orange lounge radio live orange lounge

I loved that! Oh, it was great!

2151
03:03:32,760 --> 03:03:34,760
Well, it was pretty good. Well, it wasn't bad.

2152
03:03:34,760 --> 03:03:36,760
Well, there were parts of it that weren't very good, though. It could have been a lot better.

2153
03:03:36,760 --> 03:03:38,760
I didn't really like it. It was pretty terrible.

2154
03:03:38,760 --> 03:03:45,760
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.

2155
