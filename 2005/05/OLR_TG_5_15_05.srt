Hi!

00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,640
Hello, how are you?

15
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,640
Creaky.

16
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,640
Creaky?

17
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,640
What's wrong?

18
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:06,480
It was just my throat's going.

19
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,680
Yeah, you had to talk a lot more tonight, huh?

20
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,680
Yeah.

21
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,680
During the three hour program.

22
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,240
I had to fill up for Loki's loud butt.

23
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:17,280
Yeah, Loki is not here taping the podcast with us right now because he actually, this

24
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,080
is interesting, in order for him to be freed up for the week so he can go to E3, he has

25
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,360
to spend time with a woman.

26
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:28,000
so that's cute though so sweet yeah so hopefully he's having fun he'll be back

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,700
of course for the shows live for me three wednesday thursday friday which

28
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:35,160
he's very excited about as well before we get into tonight's news i want to

29
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:40,200
state that we're going to be fielding questions for the and I want to give you

30
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,960
the guys the email address you can start sending your questions now because we'll

31
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:48,880
be fielding questions for our show it's the email address is e3 at orange lounge

32
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:54,880
radio dot com e3 at orange lounge radio dot com and if you send us emails to

33
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,720
that address you maybe want to know about a certain game that we don't talk

34
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:02,720
about on Wednesday's podcast send us an email there and we'll go check it out

35
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:06,240
now we won't be able to do every email but we'll try to get as many as we can

36
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,280
we'll go check it out and give you the answers Thursday or Friday's podcast so

37
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,160
it'd be a great way for those of you guys that unfortunately can't be there

38
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:17,580
in person to kind of live vicariously through us so before we get into the big

39
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:23,420
E3 news dark sacro, how was your gaming week? What kind of games? Did you play PSO blue burst?

40
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:28,740
Just a couple of nights this week me too. Honestly, I can just state my gaming week right here

41
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:32,740
I've been all about this PSO blue burst beta. It's exciting, isn't it?

42
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:41,740
You know like that you can resize the window it's all pretty cool I've been really enjoying and it runs so beautifully. Oh, yeah

43
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:47,540
Oh my gosh, what do you think of PSO blue burst as compared to PSO on the Xbox GameCube, etc?

44
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:51,140
what are there any other platforms you've played it on I miss the the chat

45
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:57,020
honestly and yes there just is something about playing PSO with a controller in

46
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:02,220
front of your big TV with the Xbox and everything a bit overall is not too bad

47
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:06,560
I do miss you know you don't have on the beta right now we don't have that

48
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:14,140
access to episode 2 we don't have access to I think it's V harden up but it's

49
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:18,160
It's kind of hard to bitch too much because it's free right now.

50
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:24,520
You can play this game absolutely free www.psobb.com and you can sign up for an account and play

51
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:28,360
and it's free right now through June 10th and of course it'll be one of those things

52
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31,980
where if you want to continue you'll have to buy the legit game but from what I'm seeing

53
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:37,120
so far I'm almost ready to quit other MMOs I'm on to play this more.

54
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,120
This and other MMOs.

55
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,640
I'm about to axe Final Fantasy XI.

56
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,560
I've heard so many good things about Guild Wars 2 I want to get in on that.

57
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,200
I kind of want to try that too.

58
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,000
I think the MMOs are shifting.

59
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,960
Unless some Final Fantasy XI news comes out at E3 that just knocks my socks off, and I

60
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:55,160
still can't get World of Warcraft to even install on my computer, so I can't even check

61
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,160
that one out still.

62
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:59,840
I've only been able to watch other people play.

63
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,240
Those games are going to get pushed aside for these new ones if nothing changes soon.

64
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,240
So we'll see.

65
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,240
We'll see.

66
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,240
Seriously.

67
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,240
So that was pretty much your gaming week, huh?

68
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,240
Yeah, pretty much.

69
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,240
Pretty much mine too.

70
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,940
That about sums it up.

71
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:12,360
Let's get into some gaming news this week.

72
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:16,240
Usually this is kind of a dead week because it's kind of the calm before the storm, and

73
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,480
there's a lot of big secrets still to Comedy 3.

74
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,880
For instance, what is Nintendo going to say about the revolution?

75
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,280
What will we find out about PlayStation 3?

76
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:28,720
And rumors are that ads are already showing up over LA, cryptic ads about the PlayStation

77
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,720
3.

78
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,540
We'll see next week's show for sure.

79
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:36,680
But of course, Xbox kind of decided to get the jumpstart by having their MTV special

80
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,680
earlier this week.

81
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,100
Did you watch the special by chance?

82
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,100
I don't have MTV.

83
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,840
Oh yeah, you don't have cable.

84
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:46,900
I don't watch MTV either, so I'm kind of at the school of thought where I'm just going

85
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:52,580
to check it out because I'm lucky and blessed where I get to go to E3 next week so I can

86
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:54,060
just wait.

87
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:58,100
However, from what I've read on the internet, because lots of sites have been covering this,

88
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:02,900
you know, 1UP.com, GameSpot.com, all those sites, pretty much no surprises.

89
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:06,740
A lot of stuff that the speculation, it is the white system, it's thinner.

90
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:10,300
I was surprised though because the screenshots I've seen, and a lot of people have been echoing

91
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:15,900
The screenshots that have been released, not that much more impressive than Xbox One.

92
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:19,420
But I think we have to remember we're still looking at prototypes, and, you know, these

93
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:23,260
are the launch games, too, so the system can only get better from here, so I am excited

94
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:24,900
to see what the future brings.

95
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:28,900
I think all the next-gen systems are going to look damn good, though, so they're all

96
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,900
going to look near video quality.

97
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:35,780
So I don't think it's going to be a graphical contest so much as it's going to be a quality

98
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:38,500
of game contest, and...

99
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:44,500
You know, I was looking at the new releases for the Xbox 360, now that looked hot.

100
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,500
They had screen captures.

101
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,500
What kind of stuff?

102
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,500
You know what? Give me a second.

103
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,500
There was...

104
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,500
You have to ask me where my brains are working.

105
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,500
Are there particular games that you saw on a list that were coming out soon?

106
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,500
That's what I'm trying to remember.

107
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,500
Oh, like Ghost Recon 2, I think?

108
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,500
I didn't care about Ghost Recon.

109
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:14,500
I'll let you think about it for a minute, but a lot of the stuff that we found out about

110
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,460
Xbox 360 was stuff we kind of already had speculated about.

111
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,900
The power button scan is changeable.

112
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:24,400
Xbox Live is going to have a gold and a silver platform, so that's good that Xbox Live will

113
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,880
be free for some people.

114
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,960
One thing we're still not sure on though is backwards compatibility.

115
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,420
Nobody's really said one way or the other.

116
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:34,820
Now there's rumors and there's screen caps out there that are supposed to prove rumors

117
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:39,880
and everything, but we don't know anything concrete for sure absolutely just yet on that

118
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:43,460
and that's one thing I'm definitely looking forward to hearing about.

119
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:49,340
But Xbox 360 looks exciting, I gotta admit, as exciting as Xbox 360 looks, I'm excited

120
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:52,500
about the competition as well, I wanna see what Playstation and Nintendo have to come

121
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,300
up with as well, it's gonna be an exciting show.

122
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:58,540
Need for Speed was the one I was thinking of, that one actually looks pretty good.

123
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:00,540
And I'm actually looking forward to seeing Quake 4.

124
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:02,700
Oh yes, Quake 4, that's a good one.

125
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:05,580
Perfect Dark Zero. That was the one.

126
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:08,580
Oh, those are all very sexy games, so it is going to have a very nice lineup.

127
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:10,860
Perfect Dark was a Nintendo franchise, though, wasn't it?

128
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,060
Yeah, very strange, huh?

129
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,220
It was on the 64.

130
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:15,660
But it was a rare game, and I think they parted ways with it.

131
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:19,140
Yeah, rare is, though, working with...

132
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:23,100
Yeah, I remember that story a long time ago, so very interesting there.

133
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:26,700
One other interesting thing, I think, about the Xbox 360 that we heard this week

134
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:30,020
from Bill Gates himself in Time magazine.

135
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:34,860
He says, the next version of Halo will not, repeat, not be ready in time for the launch

136
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:39,720
of Xbox 360, however, it will be a part of the second wave.

137
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:46,140
The day Sony launches the new PlayStation, they will walk right into Halo 3.

138
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:49,100
Very interesting counter move.

139
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:52,820
Because Microsoft wants to get up the jump on next-gen gaming, which some say could hurt

140
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:56,660
them, this is the interesting twist they'll have, and I think a lot of us have seen this

141
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:57,860
coming a mile away.

142
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:02,320
They're going to release Halo 3 probably same week, same day as PlayStation 3 just to punch

143
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,880
them in the stomach basically.

144
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,260
Interesting tactic.

145
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:10,600
I think for us hardcore gamers that have money to spend, well not that I necessarily have

146
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,620
money to spend, but I'll find money somehow.

147
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:16,060
I'll probably get all these systems anyway, sad but true.

148
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,620
You know what my house is like.

149
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:22,340
But let's, the normal person that, you know, can't, you know, college kid that can't afford

150
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:25,500
necessarily all these systems, it's going to make the decision kind of tough.

151
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:29,500
I think, I think it'll really depend on Sony's launch titles

152
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,580
and I hope Nintendo's learning their lesson after the DS with launch titles

153
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:33,340
as well. They need

154
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:36,340
any stronger launch titles because I was not impressed with DS launch.

155
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:40,740
Yeah. But hopefully Revolution will have some strong strong launch titles. We'll see.

156
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:45,460
Very interesting there. Speaking of Nintendo, Revolution is confirmed for

157
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:48,620
2006, although that may not be the name, it's still the working name.

158
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:53,780
Revolution is still what we're looking at. 2006, it will play DVDs and they are

159
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:54,420
saying

160
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:58,980
backwards compatible they're already saying GameCube games will play good

161
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:02,260
I think that's a good I think especially with when you think

162
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:05,900
Zelda is gonna come out now towards the tail end of GameCube's release

163
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:09,020
Zelda could actually sell revolutions who knows

164
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:12,140
absolutely and you know the Nintendo way of doing things they'll put something

165
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:16,100
extra in it if you're on a revolution or something you remember like the

166
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:20,100
the color Game Boy Zelda's if you play them on an advance you got a special shop

167
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:23,100
Yeah. All sorts of that kind of stuff.

168
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:26,600
Um, while we're speaking of E3 and things that we're going to be seeing at E3,

169
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,600
DarkSucker, I'm kind of curious, what things are you looking forward to seeing at E3?

170
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,100
Um...

171
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:35,100
Uh, the new Katamari Damacy.

172
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,100
Hopefully.

173
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,100
It is, I want to see more on that.

174
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,600
Um...

175
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,100
Really, it's, I'm just going to see what I see as I see it.

176
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:48,100
I've tried not to read into any of the hype.

177
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:53,100
I've tried not to look toward anything. I want to go, and I want to be surprised.

178
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,100
Ooh.

179
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:58,100
And I want the skyline to be back over at the Namco area.

180
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:01,100
I'm sorry to spoil some things for you on this show, then, but you know I have-

181
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:06,100
It's fine, I knew it, but I still want to go in and go, oh, you know.

182
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,100
At least you've been staying away from screenshots. That can be a big one.

183
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:11,100
Except for some of the 360 stuff, because they were hot.

184
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:14,100
Um, Sega, I know you love Sega.

185
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,100
Sega!

186
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:20,740
Sega Z3 lineups announced. They'll be showing Phantasy Star Universe, Gunstar Superheroes,

187
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:23,880
Ooooh, I saw a video of that!

188
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:28,880
Some titles for the 360, Condemned Criminal Origins and Full Auto. Of course, you can

189
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:33,520
expect to see a lot of this. Shadow the Hedgehog will probably be the title. They're pushing

190
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,720
more than anything this year.

191
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,600
Yeah, but it's not Sonic.

192
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:43,600
I know, but that's Sega. Any comments on that? I'm excited about Phantasy Star Universe.

193
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:51,920
universe I'm all about PSO again now take it um let's see also a story we

194
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,800
were talking about previously you know how Namco likes to license just all this

195
00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:00,080
stuff they license what the peanuts and palm pie all the stuff guess what they

196
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:06,840
license now curious George although what they've actually licensed here is that

197
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:10,280
they've licensed based off the new picture that's coming out I didn't even

198
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:13,580
know this is coming out until I read the story but Universal Pictures is doing an

199
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:21,940
animated film on Curious George so you'll be seeing something from Namco

200
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:26,620
in game form a game to coincide with the movies release no doubt that sounds fun

201
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:30,500
should be interesting yeah should be interesting I don't normally like games

202
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:35,740
based off of movies although I do wish they make a Kill Bill game but but we'll

203
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:41,660
see we'll see anyway let's do this orange launch radio we are not just here

204
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:45,500
to talk about games all the time because if we talked about games all the time we

205
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,700
would have no time to go to Disneyland which by the way we're gonna do this

206
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:51,620
week that's gonna be we have to take a lot of pictures of Disneyland very excited

207
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:56,780
about that so to acknowledge that there is more to life than just games Dark

208
00:11:56,780 --> 00:12:01,300
Sakura is here to give you her advice column Dark Sakura what is tonight's

209
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:06,580
advice column all about today's piece of advice is how to survive if you are

210
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:11,420
stopped by the police. Wait, how to survive if you're stopped by the police?

211
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:18,340
Okay. Jackson! Wow, okay. First of all, don't let Sting open his mouth. No! Okay.

212
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:22,740
Number one, pull over immediately. Put hazard lights on, turn off the radio, and

213
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:26,660
cut the engine. Roll down the window. Keep hands in plain sight. Make sure your

214
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:32,260
passenger's hands are also in view. Two, address the officer as officer. Three, tell

215
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,260
Tell the truth.

216
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:35,900
Do not claim you didn't do it, even if you did.

217
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:36,900
4.

218
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:39,140
Don't argue with the officer.

219
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:42,580
Don't give any reason for the officer to take an interest in your case, which may encourage

220
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:44,780
the officer to appear in court.

221
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:48,940
Many defendants succeed in court because the officer is not present.

222
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:49,940
5.

223
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:51,540
Choose your test wisely.

224
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:55,140
If stopped for driving under the influence of alcohol and given the choice of a breath,

225
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:58,940
blood, or urine test, choose blood only if you're certain you're innocent.

226
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:03,460
Ensure choose the urine test the least accurate or the breath test do not admit anything

227
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:08,380
Six contacts a lawyer if you fail any tests in our charge remain silent and call lawyer

228
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,120
What's your final piece of advice?

229
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:14,120
Is don't freaking go driving a Davis

230
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,620
Nobody outside of NorCal is gonna get that show

231
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:26,500
Which by the way the police have nothing better to do in that town than pull you over for everything

232
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:30,100
You know, typically your advice columns are a little out there.

233
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,800
Let's face it, your advice columns are a little out there usually, like you know,

234
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:37,000
how to avoid the piranhas was one, but this was actually some practical advice.

235
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,100
So, thank you.

236
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:42,400
You know, piranha advice is practical.

237
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,900
Okay, maybe not for me, but maybe for someone else.

238
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:48,200
Never know when you're gonna go swimming in a river in Brazil.

239
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:51,900
All right, well, that was actually some practical advice, especially when you consider that

240
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,600
we're going to be going to LA next week.

241
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,800
Yeah, we'll probably need that.

242
00:13:55,800 --> 00:14:00,480
and the Rodney King thing and all, I mean, who can't we all just get along?

243
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,600
Final Fantasy VII Advent Children has a date.

244
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:08,700
This is neat. I like this. I like when things come out worldwide at the same

245
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:09,280
time.

246
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:15,440
Japan and the US currently being, I think, rumored. I'm not sure if this is

247
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,360
confirmed,

248
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:20,360
but it does look like we are gonna head towards a near simultaneous release

249
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:24,860
September 14th in Japan for sure, and I believe they're saying US as well

250
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:29,860
is gonna hit that day as well. UMD maybe not that same day but shortly thereafter.

251
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:33,180
So that's exciting. I'm definitely looking forward to Advent Children

252
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:36,260
and Squeenix's booth at E3 I'm looking forward to as well.

253
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:39,860
Kingdom Hearts 2 even though I wasn't a fan of the first one necessarily and I

254
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:41,620
know that sounds... Kingdom Hearts 2 is like

255
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:44,660
hot. The trailer is... I watched the trailer.

256
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:47,860
Well actually let me... I like watching

257
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:50,980
Kingdom Hearts. I like watching people play Kingdom Hearts. I don't like playing

258
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:53,340
Kingdom Hearts myself because I get frustrated with the camera and stuff.

259
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:59,260
Supposed to fix the gummy ship. Oh, right made a lot more fun, but it's all about seeing seeing Mickey. Oh

260
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,780
As the king, you know, he's in the trailer and he's in there in the black gear

261
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:13,260
Also speaking of black Ninja Gaiden black coming out very soon

262
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:19,940
It's gonna be shown at e3 this week coming out on the Xbox. Of course Ninja Gaiden on the Xbox was

263
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:25,580
huge it some say it it helped revive the Xbox and kind of bring it up into second

264
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:30,240
place so very exciting about what is going to be released very soon on Xbox

265
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:36,720
Ninja Gaiden black so it's gonna have more of like an entry-level difficulty

266
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,960
setting on it a lot of people complain that the first Ninja Gaiden was a little

267
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:46,880
too hard so that's good a new 50 mission mission mode that should be interesting

268
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:53,880
and downloadable hurricane packs via Xbox Live. Very interesting, huh?

269
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:58,880
That's pretty cool. I thought that was pretty fun, too.

270
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:04,880
Too bad, though, that Kunoichi wasn't as good, or Nightshade, as it was over here.

271
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,880
I'll have to be honest, I didn't play Ninja Gaiden on Xbox. I just heard it was good.

272
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:13,880
Well, it was pretty good. It was all about dashing back and forth.

273
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:20,480
Mm-hmm. Xbox Live, you know that they have the arcade thing on Xbox Live where you can

274
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,920
download these games like Bejeweled, Super Collapse...

275
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,080
Pac-Man!

276
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:28,600
I think, is Pac-Man, Namco Vintage stuff? Yeah, so Pac-Man's in there.

277
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,880
We downloaded Pac-Man once.

278
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:33,920
Azuma and a lot of those things you'll see on PopCap. It actually, they released their

279
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:38,440
fifteenth game this week. Crazy, huh? And they're going to be rolling it out into Europe

280
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:41,800
and Asia. What do you think of the Xbox Live Arcade? For me, it's kind of like...

281
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:47,000
Pac-Man. Yeah, but isn't Pac-Man old? I mean, don't get me wrong, I have a lot of respect

282
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,820
for Pac-Man, I didn't think it was old. I'm such a retro gamer, it was just cool playing

283
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:56,580
Pac-Man on the Xbox. If you have any feedback on the Orange Launch Radio 2 Go edition, send

284
00:16:56,580 --> 00:17:02,000
us an email, togo, t-o-g-o at orangelaungeradio.com. Any interesting emails lately you want to

285
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,600
share with us? Give me a second. Well, it's alright, if you don't have any off the top

286
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:11,760
of your head. Well, no, actually, I haven't really had too much of an opportunity to

287
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:16,200
to give much attention to it last week because, again, I was getting ready.

288
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:20,120
I had two weeks' worth of homework to finish in a week.

289
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:32,680
But it was just, you know, for everybody that we hear from, we have David who goes

290
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:41,360
by Warrior Bob email on the 10th sent me an email saying that he actually agreed

291
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,360
with my little rant there about how parents should do their job.

292
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:47,360
Oh yes, your rant last week, I remember that.

293
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:51,840
I got some feedback on the 1UP.com community too that they were, you know, they liked it

294
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,840
too, so.

295
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:53,840
Huh.

296
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:58,960
Well, you know, I know I get vocal, and I know I get really into what I'm saying, and

297
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,440
believe it or not, I'm not like this all the time.

298
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:08,360
I do get bitchy moments, but I'm not just like, all the damn time, but that is something

299
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:11,200
I feel very strongly about, you know.

300
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:19,200
you don't want to piss off Jamie I'm just teasing I cut you but uh but um but

301
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,160
it was cool to get that kind of feedback in here that kind of agreement from

302
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:27,800
listeners and that gives me a little bit more hope I think that people are

303
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:32,240
conscious of this now and are trying to encourage other people to start taking

304
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,100
and responsibility for themselves and for their kids.

305
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:39,800
And also, hates Bi-Rite too.

306
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,280
I hate Bi-Rite.

307
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,620
I told my friend Julie about this,

308
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:46,920
and we laughed, and we laughed.

309
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,820
So the news last week about Bi-Rite going under,

310
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:52,300
because Better Business Bureau shut them down.

311
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,140
Interesting.

312
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,480
All right.

313
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:59,400
This is the audio equivalent of me pointing and laughing.

314
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:13,720
I think this is actually really exciting news, much more exciting news than people are making

315
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,720
it out to be.

316
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:20,320
iTunes is now carrying music from Final Fantasy, and when I say iTunes is carrying music from

317
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:24,360
Final Fantasy, I mean they are carrying like the Japanese import albums.

318
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:29,480
They're carrying the 220-2002 live concert CD.

319
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:34,680
They're carrying the original four-disc soundtracks for the later games, Final Fantasy X.

320
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:37,520
They're carrying the Black Mages album, both of them.

321
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:41,480
This is stuff you couldn't get in the U.S. before, and now you can buy them on iTunes.

322
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:45,080
What I think is exciting about this is that this is hopefully going to be a trend, and

323
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:48,840
we're going to see other game companies start to release their game music legitimately on

324
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:49,840
iTunes.

325
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,800
Now I know there are legitimate methods out there, but you know what?

326
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:56,800
not reward the people who bring us the music? And, you know, sometimes getting the music

327
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,640
illegitimately can kind of be a pain in the ass, because, you know, people aren't seating

328
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:04,960
on BitTorrent or WinMX or NAQ, whatever it is. It's worth the 99 cents just to pull the

329
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:09,040
song right away, I think. Especially considering that these CDs cost usually twice as much

330
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:12,320
to import. So that's kind of exciting news. What do you think about that? I know you're

331
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,720
not a big iTunes user, but...

332
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:19,660
I'm not an iTunes user at all. On the converse, you, you know, try to download a 14-track

333
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:28,740
CD and you end up paying $14 for this 14-track CD. You know what $14 can do? It can buy me

334
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:35,340
lunch and dinner. Instead, I can go out, oh wait, I already have those CDs.

335
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:40,580
But that's how much you'd buy if you bought it at the record store too, you know? Usually

336
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:45,460
iTunes, if you buy something like an album, it's typically not as if you bought it all

337
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:48,980
one try. So typically it's a discounted price for the whole album. I don't think I've ever

338
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:55,400
seen any like above 1299 so it's actually a I was reading some of the

339
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:59,200
British gaming news it's actually a game coming out I'm interested I was gonna I

340
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,040
was gonna ask you what's going on for our UK fans who are listening what's

341
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,460
going on in the British gaming world I haven't found too much different from

342
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:09,840
what I read last week and I did however find some news that hip games is

343
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:16,380
releasing Call of Cthulhu destiny's end hmm as a survival horror game who we

344
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:20,300
like survival horror games. And where I actually never did read any of the

345
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:26,300
Lovecraft, you know, stories. I do know of Cthulhu because I've played Call of Cthulhu

346
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:34,240
roleplay, and I'm actually looking forward to a Call of Cthulhu game. But you can play

347
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:41,520
as either a character named Emily or Jacob, who go back to this town called

348
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:48,360
N's mouth to check these ruins there so you are playing as one or the other hmm

349
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:53,480
and it's supposed to be pretty unique you know I consider if it's if it's

350
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:59,120
based off of you know Lovecraft it's gonna blow Resident Evil and Silent Hill

351
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:07,720
away. I love Silent Hill. That's fighting words. But if they do it right because the Cthulhu stuff is

352
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:12,160
like really freaking spooky I don't know I still love my silent hill I'm so

353
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:18,440
excited about the movie but no no coke through any release date let me see are

354
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:22,480
we gonna get that here I hope so that's not just a UK I've never heard of hip

355
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:27,640
games I'm scheduled to lunch in 2006 this is gonna be next year hope we get

356
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:33,600
it all right and lastly tonight with e3 coming next week and us podcasting from

357
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:37,280
there one thing that people always talk about it e3 and you see on the TV

358
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:42,160
The Booth Babes at E3, Dark Soccer, I know you're excited about the Booth Babes.

359
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,120
I need me some Booth boys.

360
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:46,720
Well, this is interesting.

361
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:52,700
Age Tech has launched an anti-Booth Babe campaign.

362
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:56,760
They believe that Booth Babes take attention away from the games and they want to take

363
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:00,120
the focus back to where it should be.

364
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:03,840
They're refusing in fact to have Booth Babes at the show and what they're going to do,

365
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:09,540
going to hire 10 unattractive women to work their booth. Gee, if I were one of those women

366
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:11,680
right now, I'd feel real good about myself.

367
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,960
I'd be kind of insulted.

368
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:18,200
I know, me too. That's kind of like, I'm like with the story, I'm like, okay, okay, cool,

369
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:25,120
okay, and then I'm like, oh, well, you assholes. Well, whatever. H-Tech, of course, they make

370
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:31,160
video games and hardware for console systems. They launched anti-boothbabes.com. All they

371
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:35,520
have right now though is an order form for a free t-shirt but perhaps by the

372
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:40,420
time you hear this podcast they may have something a little more age text anti

373
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:43,600
babes as they're calling them they're gonna hand out granny panties that have

374
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:48,000
age text logos on it that is funny now that's kind of funny see that story goes

375
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,360
like cool suck cool I don't know I don't why don't they just have booth guys

376
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:57,280
there's a booth boys I don't know I don't get it maybe because the Marines

377
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:00,200
are gonna be there and that they're considered the Marines are gonna be

378
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:07,120
there exactly okay I'm I'm I'm gonna try and get my picture with as many booth

379
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:12,640

00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:56,680
oh, excuse me, and everything,

398
00:24:56,680 --> 00:25:00,320
and we gotta do three, so I'm excited about that.

399
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:03,400
That's it, my final thought would be,

400
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:06,680
it's gonna be a wild ride, and I'm Disneyland.

401
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,440
I'm so excited about Disneyland.

402
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:12,000
Eating at the, whatever, the Boo Bayou place.

403
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,400
I wanna find the Tiki Tiki Tiki room, for one.

404
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,240
But the other thing I wanna find,

405
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,180
I wanna find the place that sells liquor.

406
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:19,980
Even though it's supposed to be invite only, I don't care.

407
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:20,960
I'm getting an invite.

408
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:21,800
Liquor.

409
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,840
Dark Soccer, your final thought.

410
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,860
Reject false icons.

411
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:26,040
