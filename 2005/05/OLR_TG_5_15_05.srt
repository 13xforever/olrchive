00:00:00,558 --> 00:00:03,781
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, week of May 16th, 2005.

2
00:00:04,001 --> 00:00:13,829
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello once again, and welcome to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your home, gamers, for what you really want to know about.

3
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:15,070
[SPEAKER_00]: We're excited because

4
00:00:30,711 --> 00:00:37,881
[SPEAKER_03]: We're packing, actually we're very stressed because we're packing our bags, getting ready to go to E3 next week where we are going to be podcasting each day from the show.

5
00:00:37,941 --> 00:00:40,084
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can look for something on our feed Wednesday, Thursday, Friday night.

6
00:00:40,484 --> 00:00:46,432
[SPEAKER_03]: Technical problems aside, hopefully nothing comes up, but we think we have something worked out where we're going to be able to podcast.

7
00:00:47,619 --> 00:00:49,221
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, Jamie Summers, Creaky, DismanthroatsGoing

8
00:01:06,783 --> 00:01:07,624
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

9
00:01:33,078 --> 00:01:33,599
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

10
00:01:47,876 --> 00:02:02,866
[SPEAKER_03]: E3 at OrangeLoungeRadio.com E3 at OrangeLoungeRadio.com And if you send us emails to that address, maybe you want to know about a certain game that we don't talk about on Wednesday's podcast, send us an email there and we'll go check it out.

11
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:06,268
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we won't be able to do every email, but we'll try to get as many as we can.

12
00:02:06,488 --> 00:02:09,110
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll go check it out and give you the answers Thursday or Friday's podcast.

13
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:14,273
[SPEAKER_03]: So it would be a great way for those of you guys that unfortunately can't be there in person to kind of live vicariously through us.

14
00:02:14,513 --> 00:02:14,633
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

15
00:02:16,462 --> 00:02:17,042
[SPEAKER_03]: PSO Blue Burst Beta

16
00:02:38,749 --> 00:02:39,450
[SPEAKER_02]: PSO on the Xbox, GameCube, etc.

17
00:03:01,152 --> 00:03:02,233
[SPEAKER_02]: But overall, it's not too bad.

18
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:08,057
[SPEAKER_02]: I do miss, you know, you don't have, on the beta right now, we don't have access to Episode 2.

19
00:03:08,638 --> 00:03:12,701
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have access to, I think it's V Harden Up.

20
00:03:13,686 --> 00:03:18,068
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's kind of hard to bitch too much because it's free right now.

21
00:03:18,128 --> 00:03:19,789
[SPEAKER_03]: You can play this game absolutely free.

22
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:24,631
[SPEAKER_03]: www.psobb.com And you can sign up for an account and play.

23
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:26,932
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's free right now through June 10th.

24
00:03:27,232 --> 00:03:31,254
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course it'll be one of those things where if you want to continue, you'll have to buy the legit game.

25
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:35,576
[SPEAKER_03]: But from what I'm seeing so far, I'm almost ready to quit other MMOs I'm on.

26
00:03:35,962 --> 00:03:38,164
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm about to axe Final Fantasy XI I kinda wanna try that too

27
00:03:59,723 --> 00:04:03,110
[SPEAKER_03]: Those games are going to get pushed aside for these new ones if nothing changes soon.

28
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:04,332
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll see.

29
00:04:04,353 --> 00:04:04,834
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously.

30
00:04:05,275 --> 00:04:06,617
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was pretty much your gaming week, huh?

31
00:04:06,898 --> 00:04:07,700
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, pretty much.

32
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:08,542
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty much mine, too.

33
00:04:08,842 --> 00:04:09,504
[SPEAKER_03]: About sums it up.

34
00:04:10,074 --> 00:04:11,354
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

35
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,080
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have MTV.

36
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:35,661
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't watch TV.

37
00:05:01,556 --> 00:05:02,678
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

38
00:05:12,908 --> 00:05:18,032
[SPEAKER_03]: Not that much more impressive than Xbox One, but I think we have to remember we're still looking at prototypes.

39
00:05:18,472 --> 00:05:22,495
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, these are the launch games, too, so the system can only get better from here.

40
00:05:22,555 --> 00:05:24,537
[SPEAKER_03]: So I am excited to see what the future brings.

41
00:05:25,017 --> 00:05:30,481
[SPEAKER_03]: I think all the next-gen systems are going to look damn good, though, so they're all going to look near video quality.

42
00:05:30,841 --> 00:05:37,366
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't think it's going to be a graphical contest so much as it's going to be a quality-of-game contest and...

43
00:05:38,782 --> 00:05:42,365
[SPEAKER_02]: I was looking at the new releases for the Xbox 360.

44
00:05:43,305 --> 00:05:44,426
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that looked hot.

45
00:05:44,926 --> 00:05:46,067
[SPEAKER_02]: They had screen captures.

46
00:05:46,327 --> 00:05:47,248
[SPEAKER_03]: What kind of stuff?

47
00:05:48,869 --> 00:05:49,489
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

48
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:51,030
[SPEAKER_02]: Give me a second.

49
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:57,454
[SPEAKER_02]: There was... You have to ask me when my brain's not working.

50
00:05:57,494 --> 00:06:00,296
[SPEAKER_03]: Particular games that you saw on a list that were coming out soon?

51
00:06:01,457 --> 00:06:02,457
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I'm trying to remember.

52
00:06:02,718 --> 00:06:05,700
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, like Ghost Recon 2, I think.

53
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,140
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't care about Ghost Recon.

54
00:06:07,261 --> 00:06:07,521
[SPEAKER_03]: It was...

55
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:13,193
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, I'll let you think about it for a minute.

56
00:06:13,213 --> 00:06:17,096
[SPEAKER_03]: But a lot of the stuff that we found out about Xbox 360 was stuff we kind of already had speculated about.

57
00:06:17,421 --> 00:06:19,322
[SPEAKER_03]: The power button scan is changeable.

58
00:06:19,802 --> 00:06:25,284
[SPEAKER_03]: Xbox Live is going to have a gold and a silver platform, so that's good that Xbox Live will be free for some people.

59
00:06:25,825 --> 00:06:28,686
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing we're still not sure on, though, is backwards compatibility.

60
00:06:28,746 --> 00:06:30,327
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody's really said one way or the other.

61
00:06:30,367 --> 00:06:39,891
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, there's rumors and there's screen caps out there that are supposed to prove rumors and everything, but we don't know anything concrete for sure absolutely just yet on that.

62
00:06:39,951 --> 00:06:42,032
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's one thing I'm definitely looking forward to hearing about.

63
00:06:43,308 --> 00:06:43,808
[SPEAKER_03]: Xbox 360, Quake 4

64
00:07:00,931 --> 00:07:02,392
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yes, Quake 4, that's a good one.

65
00:07:02,652 --> 00:07:03,652
[SPEAKER_02]: And Perfect Dark Zero.

66
00:07:04,293 --> 00:07:04,973
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the one.

67
00:07:05,713 --> 00:07:06,974
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, those are all very sexy games.

68
00:07:06,994 --> 00:07:08,435
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is going to have a very nice lineup.

69
00:07:08,455 --> 00:07:11,016
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect Dark was a Nintendo franchise, though, wasn't it?

70
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:11,956
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, very strange, huh?

71
00:07:12,077 --> 00:07:12,477
[SPEAKER_02]: It was on the 64.

72
00:07:13,197 --> 00:07:15,998
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was a Rare game, and I think they parted ways with it.

73
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:21,241
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Rare is, though, working with... Yeah, I remember that story a long time ago.

74
00:07:21,361 --> 00:07:22,582
[SPEAKER_03]: So, very interesting there.

75
00:07:23,382 --> 00:07:29,285
[SPEAKER_03]: One other interesting thing, I think, about the Xbox 360 that we heard this week, from Bill Gates himself, in Time Magazine...

76
00:07:30,069 --> 00:07:35,613
[SPEAKER_03]: He says, the next version of Halo will not, repeat, not be ready in time for the launch of Xbox 360.

77
00:07:36,074 --> 00:07:38,836
[SPEAKER_03]: However, it will be a part of the second wave.

78
00:07:39,897 --> 00:07:44,661
[SPEAKER_03]: The day Sony launches the new PlayStation, they will walk right into Halo 3.

79
00:07:46,002 --> 00:07:48,484
[SPEAKER_03]: Very interesting counter move.

80
00:07:48,884 --> 00:07:55,669
[SPEAKER_03]: Because Microsoft wants to get up the jump on next-gen gaming, which some say could hurt them, this is the interesting twist they'll have.

81
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:57,451
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think a lot of us could have seen this coming a mile away.

82
00:07:57,824 --> 00:08:03,525
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to release Halo 3 probably same week, same day as PlayStation 3 just to punch them in the stomach, basically.

83
00:08:04,505 --> 00:08:05,505
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting tactic.

84
00:08:06,386 --> 00:08:12,487
[SPEAKER_03]: I think for us hardcore gamers that have money to spend, well, not that I necessarily have money to spend, but I'll find money somehow.

85
00:08:12,687 --> 00:08:14,687
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll probably get all these systems anyway.

86
00:08:16,007 --> 00:08:17,187
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what my house is like.

87
00:08:17,507 --> 00:08:25,309
[SPEAKER_03]: But the normal person, college kid that can't afford necessarily all these systems, it's going to make the decision kind of tough.

88
00:08:25,749 --> 00:08:26,029
[SPEAKER_03]: I think...

89
00:08:26,994 --> 00:08:32,999
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it'll really depend on Sony's launch titles, and I hope Nintendo's learned their lesson after the DS with launch titles as well.

90
00:08:33,019 --> 00:08:36,242
[SPEAKER_03]: They need stronger launch titles, because I was not impressed with DS launch.

91
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:36,762
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

92
00:08:37,263 --> 00:08:40,185
[SPEAKER_03]: But hopefully Revolution will have some strong, strong launch titles.

93
00:08:40,245 --> 00:08:40,625
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

94
00:08:41,806 --> 00:08:42,627
[SPEAKER_03]: Very interesting there.

95
00:08:42,687 --> 00:08:47,531
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of Nintendo, Revolution is confirmed for 2006, although that may not be the name.

96
00:08:47,571 --> 00:08:48,492
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still the working name.

97
00:08:49,353 --> 00:08:50,994
[SPEAKER_03]: Revolution is still what we're looking at.

98
00:08:51,454 --> 00:08:50,994
2006.

99
00:08:51,615 --> 00:08:54,297
[SPEAKER_03]: It will play DVDs, and they are saying...

100
00:08:54,915 --> 00:08:55,755
[SPEAKER_03]: backwards compatible.

101
00:08:55,815 --> 00:08:58,516
[SPEAKER_03]: They're already saying GameCube games will play.

102
00:08:58,616 --> 00:08:58,856
[SPEAKER_03]: Good.

103
00:08:59,057 --> 00:09:05,759
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's a good thing, especially when you think Zelda is going to come out now towards the tail end of GameCube's release.

104
00:09:06,359 --> 00:09:08,260
[SPEAKER_03]: Zelda could actually sell revolutions.

105
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:08,960
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows?

106
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:09,620
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, absolutely.

107
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,441
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know the Nintendo way of doing things.

108
00:09:11,461 --> 00:09:14,822
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll put something extra in it if you're on a revolution or something.

109
00:09:15,082 --> 00:09:17,703
[SPEAKER_03]: You remember like the color Game Boy Zeldas?

110
00:09:17,783 --> 00:09:19,924
[SPEAKER_03]: If you played them on an advance, you got a special shop.

111
00:09:20,284 --> 00:09:20,644
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

112
00:09:20,765 --> 00:09:21,945
[SPEAKER_03]: All sorts of that kind of stuff.

113
00:09:23,775 --> 00:09:29,399
[SPEAKER_03]: While we're speaking of E3 and things that we're going to be seeing at E3, DarkSakura, I'm kind of curious, what things are you looking forward to seeing at E3?

114
00:09:31,781 --> 00:09:33,322
[SPEAKER_02]: The new Katamari Damashii.

115
00:09:35,183 --> 00:09:35,644
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully.

116
00:09:37,345 --> 00:09:38,426
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to see more on that.

117
00:09:42,049 --> 00:09:45,131
[SPEAKER_02]: Really, I'm just going to see what I see as I see it.

118
00:09:45,571 --> 00:09:47,333
[SPEAKER_02]: I've tried not to read into any of the hype.

119
00:09:48,053 --> 00:09:50,235
[SPEAKER_02]: I've tried not to look toward anything.

120
00:09:50,315 --> 00:09:52,477
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to go and I want to be surprised.

121
00:09:53,437 --> 00:09:54,538
[SPEAKER_03]: Saga!

122
00:10:15,171 --> 00:10:16,832
[SPEAKER_03]: Sega Z3 lineups announced.

123
00:10:16,852 --> 00:10:27,756
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll be showing Phantasy Star Universe, Gunstar Super Heroes, some titles for the 360, Condemned, Criminal Origins, and Full Auto.

124
00:10:28,356 --> 00:10:30,117
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, you can expect to see a lot of this.

125
00:10:30,497 --> 00:10:34,558
[SPEAKER_03]: Shadow the Hedgehog will probably be the title they're pushing more than anything this year.

126
00:10:34,578 --> 00:10:36,479
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but it's not Sonic.

127
00:10:36,759 --> 00:10:39,100
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, but that's Sega.

128
00:10:41,055 --> 00:10:41,455
[SPEAKER_03]: Curious George

129
00:11:04,378 --> 00:11:09,899
[SPEAKER_03]: Although what they've actually licensed here is that they've licensed based off the new picture that's coming out.

130
00:11:09,939 --> 00:11:15,160
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't even know this was coming out until I read the story, but Universal Pictures is doing an animated film on Curious George.

131
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,401
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Curious George.

132
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:19,081
[SPEAKER_02]: And the man in the yellow hat.

133
00:11:20,261 --> 00:11:23,162
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll be seeing something from Namco in game form.

134
00:11:23,462 --> 00:11:25,922
[SPEAKER_03]: A game to coincide with the movie's release, no doubt.

135
00:11:26,002 --> 00:11:28,663
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds fun.

136
00:11:29,263 --> 00:11:33,224
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't normally like games based off of movies, although I do wish they'd make a Kill Bill game.

137
00:11:33,905 --> 00:11:35,526
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, what is tonight's advice column all about?

138
00:12:04,073 --> 00:12:07,575
[SPEAKER_02]: Today's piece of advice is how to survive if you are stopped by the police.

139
00:12:08,976 --> 00:12:11,098
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, how to survive if you're stopped by the police?

140
00:12:11,999 --> 00:12:12,759
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

141
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,120
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, okay.

142
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:16,582
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, don't let Sting open his mouth.

143
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:17,643
No.

144
00:12:18,103 --> 00:12:18,363
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

145
00:12:18,903 --> 00:12:20,665
[SPEAKER_02]: Number one, pull over immediately.

146
00:12:20,825 --> 00:12:23,387
[SPEAKER_02]: Put hazard lights on, turn off the radio, and cut the engine.

147
00:12:23,427 --> 00:12:24,187
[SPEAKER_02]: Roll down the window.

148
00:12:24,627 --> 00:12:25,848
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep hands in plain sight.

149
00:12:26,249 --> 00:12:28,170
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure your passenger's hands are also in view.

150
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,952
[SPEAKER_02]: Two, address the officer as officer.

151
00:12:31,933 --> 00:12:32,714
[SPEAKER_02]: 3.

152
00:12:32,073 --> 00:12:32,714
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell the truth.

153
00:12:33,194 --> 00:12:35,075
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't claim you didn't do it, even if you did.

154
00:12:36,215 --> 00:12:35,075
4.

155
00:12:36,896 --> 00:12:38,396
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't argue with the officer.

156
00:12:38,957 --> 00:12:44,179
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't give any reason for the officer to take an interest in your case, which may encourage the officer to appear in court.

157
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:48,361
[SPEAKER_02]: Many defendants succeed in court because the officer is not present.

158
00:12:49,761 --> 00:12:50,962
[SPEAKER_02]: Choose your test wisely.

159
00:12:51,462 --> 00:12:58,385
[SPEAKER_02]: If stopped for driving under the influence of alcohol and given the choice of a breath, blood, or urine test, choose blood only if you're certain you're innocent.

160
00:12:58,885 --> 00:13:02,167
[SPEAKER_02]: If unsure, choose the urine test, the least accurate, or the breath test.

161
00:13:02,487 --> 00:13:03,707
[SPEAKER_02]: Do not admit anything.

162
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:03,707
6.

163
00:13:04,508 --> 00:13:05,368
[SPEAKER_02]: Contact a lawyer.

164
00:13:05,828 --> 00:13:08,549
[SPEAKER_02]: If you fail any test and are charged, remain silent and call a lawyer.

165
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:10,590
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your final piece of advice?

166
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:14,152
[SPEAKER_02]: Final piece of advice is don't freaking go driving in Davis.

167
00:13:16,869 --> 00:13:20,411
[SPEAKER_03]: The People's Republic of Davis.

168
00:13:20,871 --> 00:13:22,832
[SPEAKER_02]: Abandon hope, all ye who enter here.

169
00:13:22,852 --> 00:13:23,232
[SPEAKER_03]: For everything.

170
00:13:23,272 --> 00:13:23,453
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I've...

171
00:13:39,272 --> 00:13:41,673
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, poor advice is practical.

172
00:13:41,753 --> 00:13:44,754
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, maybe not for me, but maybe for someone else.

173
00:13:45,154 --> 00:13:48,115
[SPEAKER_03]: Never know when you're going to go swimming in a river in Brazil.

174
00:13:48,255 --> 00:13:52,856
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, well, that was actually some practical advice, especially when you consider that we're going to be going to L.A.

175
00:13:52,876 --> 00:13:53,436
[SPEAKER_03]: next week.

176
00:13:54,357 --> 00:13:55,637
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we'll probably need that.

177
00:13:56,017 --> 00:13:57,197
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Rodney King thing and all.

178
00:13:58,378 --> 00:14:00,298
[SPEAKER_02]: Can't we all just get along?

179
00:14:01,619 --> 00:14:04,540
[SPEAKER_03]: Final Fantasy VII Advent Children has a date.

180
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,500
[SPEAKER_03]: This is neat.

181
00:14:06,027 --> 00:14:06,587
[SPEAKER_03]: I like this.

182
00:14:06,647 --> 00:14:09,148
[SPEAKER_03]: I like when things come out worldwide at the same time.

183
00:14:09,589 --> 00:14:11,910
[SPEAKER_03]: Japan and the U.S.

184
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:14,891
[SPEAKER_03]: currently being, I think, rumored.

185
00:14:14,911 --> 00:14:20,274
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure if this is confirmed, but it does look like we are going to head towards a near simultaneous release.

186
00:14:20,614 --> 00:14:22,695
[SPEAKER_03]: September 14th in Japan, for sure.

187
00:14:23,015 --> 00:14:24,315
[SPEAKER_03]: And I believe they're saying U.S.

188
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:26,036
[SPEAKER_03]: as well is going to hit that day as well.

189
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:29,658
[SPEAKER_03]: UMD, maybe not that same day, but shortly thereafter.

190
00:14:30,325 --> 00:14:31,005
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's exciting.

191
00:14:31,465 --> 00:14:33,086
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm definitely looking forward to Advent Children.

192
00:14:33,566 --> 00:14:36,747
[SPEAKER_03]: And Squeenix's booth at E3 I'm looking forward to as well.

193
00:14:36,847 --> 00:14:37,287
[SPEAKER_03]: Kingdom Hearts 2.

194
00:14:37,747 --> 00:14:39,707
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though I wasn't a fan of the first one necessarily.

195
00:14:39,767 --> 00:14:42,088
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that sounds... Kingdom Hearts 2 is like hot.

196
00:14:42,728 --> 00:14:44,528
[SPEAKER_02]: The trailer is... I watched the trailer.

197
00:14:45,449 --> 00:14:46,569
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, let me put it this way.

198
00:14:46,649 --> 00:14:48,609
[SPEAKER_03]: I like watching Kingdom Hearts.

199
00:14:48,749 --> 00:14:50,210
[SPEAKER_03]: I like watching people play Kingdom Hearts.

200
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:53,351
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like playing Kingdom Hearts myself because I get frustrated with the camera and stuff.

201
00:14:53,371 --> 00:14:55,011
[SPEAKER_02]: They were supposed to fix the gummy ship.

202
00:14:55,211 --> 00:14:55,531
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, hooray.

203
00:14:55,551 --> 00:14:56,351
[SPEAKER_02]: It made it a lot more fun.

204
00:14:56,631 --> 00:14:59,072
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's all about seeing Mickey.

205
00:15:00,563 --> 00:15:01,664
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, as the king and what have you?

206
00:15:01,704 --> 00:15:02,605
[SPEAKER_02]: No, he's in the trailer.

207
00:15:03,205 --> 00:15:03,385
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh.

208
00:15:03,465 --> 00:15:04,806
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's in there in the black gear.

209
00:15:06,368 --> 00:15:07,969
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

210
00:15:07,989 --> 00:15:08,069
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh.

211
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:13,593
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, speaking of black, Ninja Gaiden Black coming out very soon.

212
00:15:14,514 --> 00:15:17,677
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be shown at E3 this week coming out on the Xbox.

213
00:15:18,057 --> 00:15:21,059
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, Ninja Gaiden on the Xbox was huge.

214
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:25,803
[SPEAKER_03]: Some say it helped revive the Xbox and kind of bring it up into second place.

215
00:15:26,143 --> 00:15:27,825
[SPEAKER_03]: So very exciting about what is...

216
00:15:28,524 --> 00:15:30,285
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be released very soon on Xbox.

217
00:15:30,786 --> 00:15:32,107
[SPEAKER_03]: Ninja Gaiden Black.

218
00:15:33,968 --> 00:15:37,351
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's going to have more of an entry-level difficulty setting on it.

219
00:15:37,411 --> 00:15:41,494
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people complained that the first Ninja Gaiden was a little too hard, so that's good.

220
00:15:42,394 --> 00:15:45,076
[SPEAKER_03]: A new 50-mission mission mode.

221
00:15:45,997 --> 00:15:46,878
[SPEAKER_03]: That should be interesting.

222
00:15:47,398 --> 00:15:52,322
[SPEAKER_03]: And downloadable hurricane packs via Xbox Live.

223
00:15:53,062 --> 00:15:53,723
[SPEAKER_03]: Very interesting, huh?

224
00:15:55,267 --> 00:15:55,527
[SPEAKER_02]: Pac-Man!

225
00:16:25,434 --> 00:16:27,556
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's Namco Vintage stuff.

226
00:16:27,596 --> 00:16:28,557
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, Pac-Man's in there.

227
00:16:28,697 --> 00:16:29,658
[SPEAKER_03]: We downloaded Pac-Man once.

228
00:16:30,038 --> 00:16:32,840
[SPEAKER_03]: Zuma and a lot of those things you'll see on PopCap.

229
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:35,522
[SPEAKER_03]: They released their 15th game this week.

230
00:16:36,143 --> 00:16:36,703
[SPEAKER_03]: Crazy, huh?

231
00:16:36,983 --> 00:16:38,925
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're going to be rolling it out into Europe and Asia.

232
00:16:39,265 --> 00:16:40,866
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think of the Xbox Live Arcade?

233
00:16:40,926 --> 00:16:42,528
[SPEAKER_03]: For me, it's kind of like... Pac-Man!

234
00:16:43,008 --> 00:16:45,030
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but isn't Pac-Man old?

235
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:47,572
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't get me wrong, I have a lot of respect for Pac-Man.

236
00:16:47,592 --> 00:16:49,113
[SPEAKER_02]: He was such a retro gamer.

237
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:50,914
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just cool playing Pac-Man on the Xbox.

238
00:16:51,355 --> 00:16:51,555
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

239
00:16:53,809 --> 00:17:02,276
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have any feedback on the Orange Lounge Radio to-go edition, send us an email togotojo at orangeloungeradio.com Any interesting emails lately you want to share with us?

240
00:17:02,756 --> 00:17:03,337
[SPEAKER_03]: Give me a second.

241
00:17:04,358 --> 00:17:04,758
[SPEAKER_03]: It's alright.

242
00:17:04,798 --> 00:17:05,959
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't have any off the top of your head.

243
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:06,559
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, no.

244
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:16,067
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I haven't really had too much of an opportunity to give much attention to it last week because, again, I was getting ready.

245
00:17:16,307 --> 00:17:20,090
[SPEAKER_02]: I had two weeks worth of homework to finish in a week.

246
00:17:21,691 --> 00:17:21,912
[SPEAKER_02]: But...

247
00:17:23,382 --> 00:17:44,386
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just, um, you know, for everybody that we hear from, uh, we have, uh, David, who, uh, who goes by, uh, WarriorBob, uh, email on, uh, on the 10th, sent me an email saying that he, uh, actually agreed with, uh, my little rant there about how parents should do their job.

248
00:17:44,406 --> 00:17:46,027
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yes, your rant last week.

249
00:17:46,087 --> 00:17:46,707
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember that.

250
00:17:46,747 --> 00:17:52,028
[SPEAKER_03]: That was, I got, I got some feedback on the 1up.com community, too, that they were, you know, they liked it, too, so.

251
00:17:52,108 --> 00:17:52,308
[SPEAKER_03]: Huh.

252
00:17:53,464 --> 00:17:58,145
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, I know I get vocal, and I know I get really into what I'm saying.

253
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:01,166
[SPEAKER_02]: And believe it or not, I'm not like this all the time.

254
00:18:01,846 --> 00:18:06,868
[SPEAKER_02]: I do get bitchy moments, but I'm not just like, all the damn time.

255
00:18:07,368 --> 00:18:09,888
[SPEAKER_02]: But that is something I feel very strongly about.

256
00:18:11,149 --> 00:18:12,249
[SPEAKER_03]: And you don't want to piss off Jamie.

257
00:18:13,389 --> 00:18:14,030
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just teasing.

258
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:16,830
[SPEAKER_02]: I cut you.

259
00:18:17,891 --> 00:18:22,812
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was cool to get that kind of feedback and hear that kind of agreement from listeners, and

260
00:18:23,812 --> 00:18:34,520
[SPEAKER_02]: That gives me a little bit more hope, I think, that people are conscious of this now and are trying to encourage other people to start taking responsibility for themselves and for their kids.

261
00:18:35,261 --> 00:18:38,984
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, hates Byright too.

262
00:18:39,004 --> 00:18:40,585
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate Byright.

263
00:18:41,426 --> 00:18:45,249
[SPEAKER_02]: I told my friend Julie about this and we laughed.

264
00:18:45,629 --> 00:18:46,890
[SPEAKER_02]: And we laughed.

265
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:49,172
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's the news last week about Byright going under.

266
00:18:49,844 --> 00:18:52,045
[SPEAKER_03]: because Better Business Bureau shut them down.

267
00:18:52,285 --> 00:18:52,666
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

268
00:18:55,007 --> 00:18:59,129
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the audio equivalent of me pointing and laughing.

269
00:19:00,933 --> 00:19:02,494
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep those emails coming in.

270
00:19:02,534 --> 00:19:03,494
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks a lot for your feedback.

271
00:19:03,514 --> 00:19:04,815
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I will answer them at work.

272
00:19:05,155 --> 00:19:07,076
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, when I get home.

273
00:19:07,636 --> 00:19:07,996
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

274
00:19:08,116 --> 00:19:10,117
[SPEAKER_03]: Toogo, T-O-G-O, at orangelegendary.com.

275
00:19:10,617 --> 00:19:14,218
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is actually really exciting news, much more exciting news than people are making it out to be.

276
00:19:14,899 --> 00:19:18,260
[SPEAKER_03]: iTunes is now carrying music from Final Fantasy.

277
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:24,222
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I say iTunes is carrying music from Final Fantasy, I mean they are carrying, like, the Japanese import albums.

278
00:19:24,262 --> 00:19:26,063
[SPEAKER_03]: They're carrying the 220-2002 live concert CD.

279
00:19:29,364 --> 00:19:37,150
[SPEAKER_03]: They're carrying the original four-disc soundtracks for the later games, Final Fantasy X. They're carrying the Black Mages albums, both of them.

280
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:38,812
[SPEAKER_03]: This is stuff you couldn't get in the U.S.

281
00:19:38,852 --> 00:19:40,773
[SPEAKER_03]: before, and now you can buy them on iTunes.

282
00:19:41,414 --> 00:19:49,340
[SPEAKER_03]: What I think is exciting about this is that this is hopefully going to be a trend, and we're going to see other game companies start to release their game music legitimately on iTunes.

283
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:51,962
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I know there are legitimate methods out there, but you know what?

284
00:19:52,754 --> 00:19:54,756
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not reward the people who bring us the music?

285
00:19:54,876 --> 00:20:02,742
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, sometimes getting the music illegitimately can kind of be a pain in the ass because, you know, people aren't CDing on BitTorrent or WinMX or NQ, whatever it is.

286
00:20:03,282 --> 00:20:09,648
[SPEAKER_03]: It's worth the 99 cents just to pull the song right away, I think, especially considering that these CDs cost usually twice as much to import.

287
00:20:10,328 --> 00:20:11,209
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's kind of exciting news.

288
00:20:11,229 --> 00:20:11,889
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think about that?

289
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:13,311
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you're not a big iTunes user.

290
00:20:13,911 --> 00:20:15,572
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not an iTunes user at all.

291
00:20:16,233 --> 00:20:18,254
[SPEAKER_02]: On the converse, you try to download a 14-track CD.

292
00:20:21,164 --> 00:20:25,246
[SPEAKER_02]: and you end up paying $14 for this 14-track CD.

293
00:20:26,087 --> 00:20:27,407
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what $14 can do?

294
00:20:28,028 --> 00:20:29,569
[SPEAKER_02]: It can buy me lunch and dinner.

295
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:35,392
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead, I can go out, oh wait, I already have those CDs.

296
00:20:35,812 --> 00:20:39,174
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's how much you'd buy if you bought it at the record store, too.

297
00:20:39,354 --> 00:20:45,918
[SPEAKER_03]: Usually iTunes, if you buy something like an album, it's typically not as if you bought it all one try.

298
00:20:45,938 --> 00:20:48,399
[SPEAKER_03]: So typically it's a discounted price for the whole album.

299
00:20:48,459 --> 00:20:49,840
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think I've ever seen any above $12.99.

300
00:20:54,298 --> 00:20:56,479
[SPEAKER_02]: I was reading some of the British gaming news.

301
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,121
[SPEAKER_02]: There's actually a game coming out I'm interested in.

302
00:20:59,181 --> 00:21:01,923
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to ask you what's going on for our UK fans who are listening.

303
00:21:01,943 --> 00:21:03,163
[SPEAKER_03]: What's going on in the British gaming world?

304
00:21:03,323 --> 00:21:05,725
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't found too much different from what I read last week.

305
00:21:06,757 --> 00:21:15,760
[SPEAKER_02]: I did, however, find some news that Hip Games is releasing Call of Cthulhu Destiny's End as a survival horror game.

306
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,320
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, we like survival horror games.

307
00:21:18,001 --> 00:21:22,822
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually never did read any of the Lovecraft stories.

308
00:21:23,862 --> 00:21:26,963
[SPEAKER_02]: I do know of Cthulhu because I've played Call of Cthulhu roleplay.

309
00:21:27,964 --> 00:21:32,005
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm actually looking forward to a Call of Cthulhu game.

310
00:21:33,331 --> 00:21:34,632
[SPEAKER_02]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

311
00:22:01,208 --> 00:22:02,629
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, I love Silent Hill.

312
00:22:02,649 --> 00:22:03,610
[SPEAKER_03]: Them's fighting words.

313
00:22:04,411 --> 00:22:09,934
[SPEAKER_02]: But if they do it right, because the Cthulhu stuff is like really freaking spooky.

314
00:22:10,315 --> 00:22:14,278
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, I still love my Silent Hill, I'm still excited about the movie, but I don't know.

315
00:22:14,758 --> 00:22:15,438
[SPEAKER_02]: Call Cthulhu.

316
00:22:15,658 --> 00:22:17,200
[SPEAKER_03]: Any release date that we see?

317
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,281
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we going to get that here?

318
00:22:19,741 --> 00:22:19,982
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope so.

319
00:22:20,002 --> 00:22:21,503
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope that's not just a UK exclusive.

320
00:22:21,563 --> 00:22:23,044
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never heard of Hip Games.

321
00:22:24,064 --> 00:22:27,026
[SPEAKER_02]: Scheduled to launch in 2006, so this is going to be next year.

322
00:22:27,307 --> 00:22:27,767
[SPEAKER_03]: Hope we get it.

323
00:22:28,476 --> 00:22:39,924
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, and lastly tonight, with E3 coming next week and us podcasting from there, one thing that people always talk about at E3 and you see on the TV, the booth babes at E3.

324
00:22:40,264 --> 00:22:42,226
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, I know you're excited about the booth babes.

325
00:22:42,246 --> 00:22:43,607
[SPEAKER_03]: I need me some booth boys.

326
00:22:44,227 --> 00:22:45,848
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, this is interesting.

327
00:22:46,889 --> 00:22:51,953
[SPEAKER_03]: AgeTech has launched an anti-booth babe campaign.

328
00:22:52,654 --> 00:22:58,798
[SPEAKER_03]: They believe that booth babes take attention away from the games, and they want to take the focus back to where it should be.

329
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:06,943
[SPEAKER_03]: They are refusing, in fact, to have booth babes at the show, and what they're going to do, they're going to hire ten unattractive women to work their booth.

330
00:23:07,743 --> 00:23:11,805
[SPEAKER_03]: Gee, if I were one of those women right now, I'd feel real good about myself.

331
00:23:11,825 --> 00:23:12,966
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be kind of insulted.

332
00:23:13,026 --> 00:23:13,947
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, me too.

333
00:23:14,687 --> 00:23:20,410
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of like, up, I'm like, with the story, I'm like, okay, okay, cool, okay, and then I'm like, oh, well, you assholes.

334
00:23:20,751 --> 00:23:21,011
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

335
00:23:22,864 --> 00:23:23,524
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, whatever.

336
00:23:24,124 --> 00:23:26,905
[SPEAKER_03]: AgeTech, of course, they make video games and hardware for console systems.

337
00:23:26,945 --> 00:23:29,626
[SPEAKER_03]: They launched AntiBoothBabes.com.

338
00:23:31,007 --> 00:23:33,968
[SPEAKER_03]: All they have right now, though, is an order form for a free t-shirt.

339
00:23:34,048 --> 00:23:37,989
[SPEAKER_03]: But perhaps by the time you hear this podcast, they may have something a little more.

340
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:44,811
[SPEAKER_03]: AgeTech's AntiBabes, as they're calling them, they're going to hand out granny panties that have AgeTech's logos on it.

341
00:23:45,171 --> 00:23:46,072
[SPEAKER_03]: That is funny.

342
00:23:46,152 --> 00:23:46,992
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, that's kind of funny.

343
00:23:47,032 --> 00:23:49,453
[SPEAKER_03]: See, that story goes like, cool, suck, cool.

344
00:23:49,593 --> 00:23:49,873
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

345
00:23:50,593 --> 00:23:52,374
[SPEAKER_03]: Why don't they just have BoothGuys?

346
00:23:53,288 --> 00:23:54,168
[SPEAKER_02]: Any Booth Boys?

347
00:23:54,809 --> 00:23:55,149
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

348
00:23:55,849 --> 00:23:56,249
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't get it.

349
00:23:56,469 --> 00:23:59,050
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe because the Marines are going to be there, and they're considered the Booth Boys.

350
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:00,491
[SPEAKER_02]: The Marines are going to be there.

351
00:24:00,551 --> 00:24:01,051
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

352
00:24:03,032 --> 00:24:03,512
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

353
00:24:04,252 --> 00:24:09,034
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to try and get my picture with as many Booth Babes as possible again this year, by the way.

354
00:24:10,274 --> 00:24:13,515
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to make, like, the Rob and his harem gallery.

355
00:24:14,016 --> 00:24:14,736
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.

356
00:24:14,836 --> 00:24:15,276
[SPEAKER_03]: You know it.

357
00:24:17,717 --> 00:24:20,619
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, that's going to do it for tonight's Orange Launch Radio To Go edition.

[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, assuming you can read.

363
00:24:46,191 --> 00:24:47,012
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you can.

364
00:24:47,052 --> 00:24:48,693
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you can read and not just listen.

365
00:24:50,434 --> 00:24:50,814
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's it.

366
00:24:50,854 --> 00:24:56,777
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of a shorter show tonight, I know, but we've got so much we've got to prepare for and Loki's not here and everything.

367
00:24:57,537 --> 00:24:59,378
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got to do three, so I'm excited about that.

368
00:25:00,339 --> 00:25:00,639
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

369
00:25:01,099 --> 00:25:06,142
[SPEAKER_03]: My final thought would be it's going to be a wild ride and Disneyland.

370
00:25:06,723 --> 00:25:08,303
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so excited about Disneyland.

371
00:25:08,483 --> 00:25:11,965
[SPEAKER_01]: Eating at the Boo Bayou place.

372
00:25:12,045 --> 00:25:12,906
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to find

373
00:25:13,717 --> 00:25:15,177
[SPEAKER_03]: The Tiki Tiki Tiki Room for one.

374
00:25:15,377 --> 00:25:17,338
[SPEAKER_03]: But the other thing, I want to find a place that sells liquor.

375
00:25:18,258 --> 00:25:19,578
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though it's supposed to be invite only.

376
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:19,939
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care.

377
00:25:19,959 --> 00:25:21,359
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm getting an invite.

378
00:25:21,539 --> 00:25:22,439
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, your final thought.

379
00:25:22,839 --> 00:25:23,900
[SPEAKER_02]: Reject false icons.

380
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,000
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, have a good one guys.

381
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:28,461
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see you next from E3.

382
00:25:28,701 --> 00:25:29,181
[SPEAKER_03]: So excited.

383
00:25:30,701 --> 00:25:34,322
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the end of another Orange Lounge Radio to go edition.

384
00:25:34,582 --> 00:25:41,564
