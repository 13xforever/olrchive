56858	85263	On tonight's episode of Orange Lounge Radio, episode 144 All three of us are back together again For the first time in a couple weeks And it's really the first time we're all together since E3 And although you guys are probably sick of hearing about it We're not done talking about E3 So we'll probably have a little bit more on that Only a little bit though, because we have other stories to move on to tonight Including what happens when Konami puts up a seemingly important poll
86314	89596	Of course, somebody's gotta go and fuck it up for everybody else.
90457	92018	We'll have more after this.

123788	128092	You're listening to Orange Line Radio Live.
128112	129474	This is not a talk radio.
129514	130535	It's so much more.
151489	152394	Oh, God.
152635	153358	Call me Daddy.
156853	160355	Orange Lounge may contain adult content.
160896	164658	Orange Lounge may contain many four-letter words.
165419	168921	Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity.
169241	175685	Orange Lounge may contain plenty of... Just kidding.
175785	179508	Orange Lounge Radio will not contain any of that in this episode.
179808	181429	Well, isn't that special?
185985	204437	Orange Lounge Radio Live is a fully interactive program via our website at www.orangeloungeradio.com And now, here are your hosts for Orange Lounge Radio Live, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.
206859	209160	We are live!
209861	210801	And this is episode number 144! 144!
213322	220688	For this, May the 29th of 2005, you're tuned in to Orange Lounge Radio, radio that gamers really want.
221028	229714	And this is Orange Lounge Radio Live, your home for all the news and discussion on rhythm and music games, as well as the gamer community and the pop culture world.
230215	236179	We're plugged in and fully interactive through our website at www.orangeloungeradio.com.
236580	238561	My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky.
238681	240903	Joining me, as always, are my awesome co-hosts,
241303	246091	In this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm, say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
255436	260141	Random News, and apparently they're taking a vigilante justice against online scam fights.
260321	263264	I've heard about that, and that's almost worth talking about a little later tonight.
263464	263824	I agree.
263945	267868	The intro does say we don't have to just talk about rhythm and music games.
268429	273494	This is why we changed my little script here in the beginning, because now we can talk about the pop culture world when we feel like it.
273995	274495	And we do.
274855	276157	Yeah.
276457	276897	Often.
277298	278419	Hey, I haven't introduced you yet.
278479	278839	Be quiet.
280506	282187	You're not here until we introduce you.
282888	285369	Not that Orange Lounge Radio doesn't ever get random anyway.
286150	287030	That's random.
287050	288051	That's why people know us.
288151	288931	No.
289312	291933	Alright, let me introduce the one and only Techmaster Loki.
292634	293734	I don't want to talk now.
294175	294955	Oh, I see how it is.
295335	296256	You're going to be like that, huh?
296876	297477	Exactly.
298017	298297	Fine.
298718	299098	Whatever.
299858	303981	Alright, we should have a... It's going to be a mediocre show tonight.
304981	305842	It'll be a slightly average.
305862	306883	You're never mediocre!
308271	309532	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
331267	336069	I hope it's not the weird remix It's not that freaky remix that was on the I think so, I think it is
363105	367069	It's related to Dead EDR, so we have to give it its three seconds of glory.
368551	368891	Alright.
370512	373755	It's one of Miklatov's favorites, too, so if he heard you saying this, he'd probably cry.
373775	375497	I know, and I didn't like it.
375817	376558	Alright.
376758	378060	I like the original.
378940	380682	And I hate the Yorain remix, too.
381042	382524	Well, we're not playing the Yorain remix.
382824	383545	Thank God.
383665	385727	I don't know, maybe at the end of the show, just for you.
386648	387028	We'll see.
388380	390044	All right, so we got all that fun stuff coming up.
390265	395236	And, if you want to, I have some of the Dance Stage Unleashed 2 tracks.
395437	396860	Oh, yes, we have to do some of those as well.
397625	405813	Dancing Stage Unleashed 2, and, and, and, that song that I brought that's sorta kinda, it's Borderline Remix.
406153	407775	It's the Metal Gear Acid song, right?
407955	408235	Yeah.
408295	409096	Ooh, we gotta hear that.
409316	412499	I think a lot of our fanboys and fangirls would appreciate that.
412540	416103	They would like to hear it, and it's not quite a remix.
416263	421088	I kinda thought about remixing it, and I'm kinda on, you know... Alright, way to hype it up.
421368	421888	Way to hype it up.
421968	424290	It's really awesome, I just, you know, see what I mean?
424490	429354	It's one of those songs that's so awesome, it's like, you know, I don't know if I want to touch it, because I don't want to make it worse than it is.
429514	435058	See what I mean about tonight being a real, just average show, because Loki's just like, yeah, I got this song, it's okay.
435798	437379	It is never average!
439641	441002	Damn it, you're supposed to make us look good.
441022	441582	Alright, I know.
442483	444024	Well, I know I always look good.
445424	447165	And you're looking okay with that haircut.
447185	447826	You're looking average.
447846	449607	My haircut... Loki, you look okay.
449867	451428	Actually, Loki, you're a little bit below average.
451468	453609	But luckily, I'm here to bring you up.
454270	456091	My haircut is bad.
456792	457732	Ah, no, I like the haircut.
457772	458553	It's too short.
459753	460934	But it's very, very red.

469711	471853	A potpourri of Bomani music for you guys.
472594	476079	Starting it off with some Rainbow Flyer because I haven't heard that song in a while and I like that one.
476259	477941	Remember 2DX8 style Rainbow Flyer?
478361	478782	It's cute.
479903	480264	Yeah.

945060	946742	OrangeLoungeRadio.com It's 5.30 in your head.
946802	947202	No, it's not.
949845	950205	Damn it.
950325	951086	I hate it when I do that.
951767	952607	Orange Lounge Radio.
953028	954049	We're on the air.
954089	954309	What?
954329	955570	I hate when you do that, too.
955911	956151	I know.
956171	957672	You really buzz the shit out of me.
957752	960335	I really... I have screwed up the show so much.
961096	961656	It's okay.
961776	963058	But it's an okay show today.
963098	965320	Next week, we're replacing Rob with a tuna.
966834	967534	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
992128	992448	Onion Flavored
1015780	1018422	Never any alcoholic drinks at the Orange Lawn Radio staff meetings ever.
1018602	1020263	Just onions.
1021064	1028069	So I queued it up to start at 4, so I had the whole playlist and my player program ready to go, and I started it at the top of the list.
1028710	1045102	Well, the problem was that the top of my screen wasn't really the top of the list, so I actually started at 4 o'clock, what was supposed to be at 4.30, and so everything ran like a half hour early, which caused a great panic when we got home from the staff meeting, and I realized, oh crap, the pre-show's almost over, but it's only 6 o'clock.
1047321	1048602	One of many ways I'm screwing up tonight.
1048902	1049823	Yeah, thank you, chatroom.
1049983	1051164	Chatroom's saying, uh, FIRED!
1052125	1052405	For me.
1052565	1052865	Thank you.
1053366	1053886	Appreciate that.
1055487	1061031	Um... Speaking of chatroom, www.orangeloungeradio.com Click on chat.
1061091	1061692	You should join us.
1061732	1063573	It's always a happy, skippy, good time.
1063893	1066595	We have a special guest who joined us there during the first break as well.
1066615	1067576	Can we get him a microphone?
1067656	1068617	Do I have to give him mine here?
1069938	1072460	The one and only Arcadian42, ladies and gentlemen.
1072660	1073100	Hello.
1073300	1073861	How are you doing?
1074281	1074962	I'm doing okay.
1075222	1076123	My computer's not.
1076163	1076683	That's why I'm here.
1077068	1081232	Wow, I'm liking this new studio because on the new mic you're actually really loud.
1081612	1081933	Alright.
1081953	1082613	Which is good.
1083154	1083554	Awesome.
1084215	1086497	I think he's loud only because we broke the mic.
1087378	1087818	Maybe.
1088959	1092883	You gotta watch the yelling tonight, Loki, because you might blow out somebody's speakers.
1093604	1095746	Oh no, I'll just get distorted beyond all hell.
1096326	1099089	I mean, because obviously you can't get louder than this, you know.
1099665	1100826	That's set to go.
1101006	1102107	So, whatever.
1102507	1102808	Alright.
1103088	1104829	We are going to get into How Is Your Week, How Is Your Day.
1104869	1110534	But first, I think it's very important that we do an Orange Lounge Radio News Update.
1110594	1112515	Because this is big news.
1112736	1113716	This is really big news.
1114877	1117860	Hey, this isn't a music update.
1118060	1120942	Orange Lounge Radio News Update.
1123124	1124165	You are too loud.
1125025	1125986	Actually, we're all too loud.
1127127	1127828	Effective...
1129102	1130343	May 28th-ish?
1130944	1131364	28th?
1131464	1137570	Earlier this week, effective earlier this week, both DarkSakura and I have quit Final Fantasy XI.
1139298	1140259	Yes, we have.
1140299	1143100	Got up and left and quit for good.
1143420	1145201	Yeah, screw that game.
1145601	1146882	Hey, screw off.
1147262	1151364	Leaving poor Loki all by himself in the world of Vanadil.
1152425	1153986	And he's enjoying every second of it.
1154026	1155226	Yeah, screw off.
1155347	1157948	Yeah, but we have PS Opium to keep us happy.
1158328	1158708	You know what?
1158928	1161750	And it's weird because I'm not even that into Blue Burst.
1161790	1164932	Like, it's cool and all, but let's face it, Jamie.
1165772	1168774	It's freaking PSO, again.
1169955	1171075	For the fourth time.
1171195	1174577	Yeah, but I can play it while doing my homework and actually get to a different window.
1174617	1176498	But Jamie, did they give us new classes?
1176658	1177219	No.
1177339	1179200	Did they give us new skins for our characters?
1179360	1180060	No.
1180421	1183422	Did they give us the type of voice support that Xbox Live had?
1183862	1184163	No.
1184223	1184463	Eventually.
1186044	1186504	Eventually?
1186524	1187124	They're working on it.
1187144	1189646	Okay, well we don't have it yet, so not yet, okay?
1191158	1197820	The only cool thing about PSO Bloober so far, other than the fact that it is PSO, and PSO is a pretty decent game, you can play it in a window.
1197940	1200181	So I can talk on aim.
1200501	1203762	Feasibly, you can cyber sex and play PSO at the same time, if you're into that.
1204423	1205663	Not that I would know anything about that.
1206223	1207584	Me neither.
1208384	1209884	Well, you can do that with Final Fantasy II.
1209924	1214406	In fact, you can actually play two sessions of Final Fantasy at the same time.
1214946	1216447	I don't know why you'd want to, but you could.
1217307	1219068	One on the PlayStation 2 and one on the PC?
1219248	1219868	No, two on the PC.
1223137	1223497	I heard about that!
1241055	1246057	But I, you mean, you know, and a lot of people go, how can they kill Morpheus?
1246197	1250839	Well, easy, here's how you can kill Morpheus, because you can make him come back, just like they're going to make Neo come back.
1250879	1254141	Well, and then the other thing is that, what are you worried about, a new movie?
1254541	1256682	Ha, not going to happen, sorry.
1258663	1261864	I know this is a newsflash to anybody, but the third Matrix movie sucked.
1262124	1264305	Therefore, there will not be any more Matrix movies.
1264325	1266486	Actually, correction, the second movie sucked.
1266986	1270108	The third movie was just kind of... Let's face it, as a whole...
1270911	1271371	It sucked.
1274914	1275995	It's kind of like Tonight Show.
1276035	1276456	It's average.
1291970	1293071	Comment from our chatroom there.
1293331	1297253	I'm apparently pissing off some of the Final Fantasy XI fans with my... Damn straight!
1297473	1299153	But see, here's where the kicker is.
1299213	1303275	Because he gave me all of his stuff, and he's like, don't sell this because I might come back.
1303575	1305236	First thing I did is sold all of it.
1307077	1310779	Ass.
1310819	1311639	Mic check.
1312099	1315341	And people wonder why I didn't give my stuff away.
1315621	1316281	I just quit.
1317282	1317762	That's fine.
1317842	1319703	Because when I come back, they'll have PvP.
1321682	1322603	I'm never coming back.
1322663	1323263	I've decided.
1323643	1324824	Okay, but here's the thing.
1324884	1331767	Somebody jaded 2005 saying, PSO and Final Fantasy, both are good, so don't quit one and go solely to another.
1332367	1334748	I'm actually not solely playing Phantasy Star Online.
1334788	1335909	I'm also playing Guild Wars.
1336769	1339551	And I'm going to be quitting all of it when Ragnarok 2 comes out.
1340611	1342032	Actually, here's...
1343485	1344646	Here's the idea behind it.
1344746	1350150	Guild Wars, a lot of my friends are into right now, and I basically got bullied into checking it out.
1350611	1353433	And I do like the idea that you don't have to pay a monthly fee.
1353733	1361179	I gotta admit, that's a big draw, because Final Fantasy XI, here I am paying $15.95 a month for three characters I'm never gonna use, right?
1363122	1365324	Why do you have three characters?
1365785	1367146	I had two of them.
1378935	1380457	And I wasn't, what, 18?
1380777	1384921	So I had my main character, my mule, and then I had a character on another server.
1385222	1389146	Because you can't server hop in Final Fantasy XI, so once you're on one server, you're stuck on it.
1389546	1396333	So, somebody who I've been getting to know lately happens to have a level 75 character and really wants to play with me.
1396713	1397894	Except he's on another server.
1397934	1399876	Well, he quit the game too, anyway, so it doesn't really matter.
1400637	1400777	So...
1401958	1413375	It's just one of those things where it's like, I've been playing it since October of 2003, I'm sick of logging on to the game every day just to farm because the economy is all fucked up because they won't do anything about the gill sellers.
1413876	1414257	I'm done.
1414377	1415779	I'm not having fun with the game anymore.
1415839	1416700	It's just, I'm sorry.
1418377	1420018	Is Final Fantasy XI a bad game?
1420118	1426021	No, it's one of the best MMOs I've ever played, but it's unfortunately just kind of starting to go down the tubes in my eyes.
1426722	1428222	I'm just not interested in it anymore.
1428343	1430864	There's probably things on there that still interest other people.
1432225	1433105	I, for one, am done.
1434206	1436467	I met some great people on Final Fantasy XI, though.
1437227	1437647	Is that the door?
1437667	1438668	Can you check?
1439844	1447310	You know, I just didn't have... And I don't like that you're pretty much forced to play with other people, because that pisses me the fuck off.
1447370	1450692	Yeah, who would want to interact with other people in an online game?
1450772	1451313	In an MMO.
1452334	1462501	Well, no, the thing I liked about Ragnarok and PSO is that I could solo all I wanted to, and if I wanted to interact with other people, I could.
1462882	1465884	Final Fantasy XI forces you to interact with other people.
1467984	1469604	How was your week?
1469645	1470945	How was your day, Dark Sakura?
1493426	1502638	I changed my entire function at work, so I'm having to remember shit from three years ago that has changed since then.
1504520	1508441	and it's just a big freaking pain in the ass.
1509621	1511382	On top of that, I'm still without my car.
1511502	1518684	Dan tried to hammer my fender back into shape and tore off my tire cover to try to get it to work or drive it.
1518724	1523545	Now my alignment is off to where when my wheel is straight, I turn rather sharply to the left.
1523605	1524705	You have a donut car.
1524766	1525446	That's awesome.
1526666	1527646	A car that does donuts.
1528346	1528827	Oh, yeah.
1529627	1533808	So my car is no longer considered safe to drive and I may be buying a new car, which is kind of cool.
1534426	1535567	E3 last week in Disneyland in my sunburn
1555598	1556058	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1584998	1589279	That's also one name away from Adam West, which makes it top of cool.
1589459	1591159	And his name is also a delicious dish.
1591799	1592479	Sorry, you're weak.
1593480	1597920	Another notable thing that happened this week is the release of Demon Days.
1599361	1599961	Gorillas.
1601921	1606082	Which made me very happy because I have the UK and the US version now, which is the same damn thing.
1606862	1612063	And of course, I was a big dumbass and didn't cancel one of my things at the time, so I have them both.
1612083	1613003	It's like a Game Boy.
1615310	1615710	I guess.
1616271	1616791	Totally.
1616871	1619313	It's like her buying Demon Days is like a Game Boy.
1619333	1622355	It's like she got the same damn thing but just like different shrink wrap colors.
1622375	1623136	She pulled a Game Boy.
1623916	1635245	They're actually exactly the same so the way that I have to tell the difference apart on them is because they have big fold over covers you know in each direction so you can have one of their faces on the front so one of them has Murdoch and the other one has 2D.
1637386	1638627	I've been squealy fangirl.
1639048	1642390	And my Japanese EP arrived for Feel Good Inc.
1642430	1644712	and it has a bunch of songs on it so I'm very happy.
1645623	1652306	I watched a ton of movies this week, none of which were any good.
1652346	1660429	I started it off with watching the original Star Wars trilogy because I have to get rid of the five movies out of the way.
1672301	1679012	Before Nelly will go see the third movie, and I want to see the third movie, but I'm not like, ooh, I have to go see it right away.
1680151	1681832	So I watched the original Star Wars trilogy.
1681872	1683592	Do you have the crap version or the good version?
1684072	1688433	I have the redone version, so... Okay, which redone version do you have?
1688493	1691254	The THX remastered or the ones with all the crap added into it?
1691374	1691934	All the crap.
1692675	1693375	I'm very sorry.
1693415	1694595	I'll copy my laser discs for you.
1694655	1695315	No, I don't want them.
1695616	1695996	Trust me.
1696656	1697096	I don't want them.
1697676	1698336	You have the crap.
1698576	1699077	I don't care.
1699097	1706619	I don't really care because no amount of crap added or subtracted from the last, you know, episode six, man.
1707851	1709532	What were they thinking, Ewoks?
1709652	1711633	Come on, that was the most retarded thing.
1711994	1716076	It was little Asian teddy bears that were attacking everything.
1716136	1717477	It was like a goddamn nightmare.
1717497	1718657	Jedi was my favorite of them.
1718777	1719818	It should have been Domo-kun.
1721079	1722440	Oh my god, that would have been actually cool.
1722600	1725541	Let me put my Star Wars fandom into perspective for you all, okay?
1725922	1734807	I got invited to a Star Wars marathon last night where they were going to watch the original trilogy in the original, I don't know, the good form or whatever you guys call it, back-to-back-to-back.
1735547	1744799	and you know, it was going to be fun and there's going to be, you know, food and stuff and it was with some of my really, really good friends and I said, no, I don't want to fucking watch Star Wars again.
1746221	1748103	That is my Star Wars fandom, ladies and gentlemen.
1748164	1753871	I actually really do want to go put in my laser just so I can get the bad taste of episodes one and two out of my mouth.
1754226	1764794	Let me just put it this way, I mean, it was, first off, Yoda was really strange looking as a puppet, and that was the best part, because it was just like, it was like the Muppets, that's what it reminded me of, the Muppets.
1765454	1770858	And the whole Ewok thing was just retarded, it's just, I was like, why the hell did he do this?
1771358	1774080	I just wanted, I just kept making fun of the movie the entire time.
1774641	1776302	And then, um, so anyways, watch that.
1776322	1778764	Then today, for some reason, I watched, um...
1779504	1780164	Running Man.
1780685	1786887	And the best part about that, and I didn't even realize it, is Richard Dawson is the goddamn host of Running Man.
1787087	1789968	You realize the average age of our listeners is like 15, 16.
1790369	1798772	Richard Dawson was the guy that used to be part of Match Game, and he was also part of the Family Feud back in the day.
1798832	1799993	He was actually a good host.
1800393	1801113	He's pretty funny.
1801673	1804114	But I just didn't realize, I'm like, dude, that's Richard Dawson.
1804134	1804695	That's awesome.
1805475	1808176	And then, for some reason, I watched Wild Wild West, or at least
1808476	1808977	Wild Wild West
1819475	1821418	That old one with Will Smith from a few years ago?
1821478	1823180	It's fucking racist as hell.
1824001	1838659	Like, they're just making, like, you know, the one guy calls him a coon, the other guy... Basically, the one villain doesn't have legs anymore, got his legs cut off or something, so Will Smith makes fun of him for being, you know, cripple, and then, you know, the other guy makes fun of him for being, you know...
1839579	1840280	Black Person.
1841080	1842921	And so, that was really interesting.
1843201	1843962	Oh yeah, that's so nice.
1844242	1860932	Anyway, so besides all the movies, actually the week was okay, I've been just doing more work stuff, you know, game accounts and whatnot, and then I was playing Final Fantasy XI, I'm level 58 now, my Black Mage, and that's awesome.
1862803	1867848	And that's pretty much it as far as gaming and stuff goes.
1867889	1875056	I was so bored today at Nelly's parents' house because they had their family over that is actually playing cell phone game Worms.
1875957	1880942	And for some reason, the AI always commits suicide, and I don't know why.
1882023	1882343	That's all.
1884321	1884641	All right.
1885721	1886582	Bradley, how was your week?
1886602	1886942	How was your day?
1887142	1892624	Actually, before I forget, I was at Dimple, by the way, and I found another Guitar Wolf something or the other, but I forgot what it was.
1894524	1894965	That's okay.
1897485	1898486	Bradley, how was your week?
1898506	1898926	How was your day?
1900146	1901187	Our week was all right.
1902067	1903367	Work went pretty fast this week.
1904068	1905948	Sometimes it's like really slow.
1906629	1908749	This week actually felt like it went pretty fast.
1908809	1913831	And then, yay, this weekend is the first full three-day weekend I get for the year.
1915765	1916205	This is good.
1916846	1920429	And then today, I was playing on here, and it stopped.
1920549	1921029	It went off.
1921870	1931919	That was because the power supply fan had been batty for the past year or so, and then it finally decided to stop, and then it burned itself out.
1932719	1935582	So I had to go to Fry's and pick up a new one and put that in.
1935742	1942367	And then when I restarted it, the network card driver died.
1944807	1945367	for some reason.
1945587	1950730	So it wanted me to reinstall, but my floppy disk drive doesn't work anymore.
1950850	1952731	It's been dead for two or three years.
1953832	1959595	So I came over here so you can see if they would probably burn me a disk or something.
1960716	1961576	And that'll happen.
1962717	1963577	And that's about all.
1964078	1967920	I played Devil May Cry because I've only played a little bit of that.
1967940	1972022	That's one of the games I got when I bought the PS2 from Jamie's friend.
1973022	1973802	I hardly ever played it.
1973822	1976123	I only played the first level until now.
1978304	1978604	That's it.
1979084	1979424	Alrighty.
1979904	1980765	My week and my day.
1981245	1988107	I went TV shopping yesterday because you know how sometimes when you have extra money it's like, oh damn, I got money to burn right now.
1988147	1988907	I gotta buy something.
1988967	1997710	So I had this urge to go out and buy a new TV because my credit card is at a zero balance right now so I'm like, I can afford to buy something nice for myself.
1998031	1999031	So I went to go look at TVs.
1999611	2001992	I really couldn't find anything
2002984	2003244	Http://bit.ly
2018383	2029327	Like, they have, like, somewhat reasonable HDTVs for, like, I don't know, $600 or something, but it seemed like one of those kinds that would break after a year, and I don't want to buy a TV if it's just going to break after a year.
2029767	2036070	And then the problem is, and I think this is why people are afraid to go up to HDTV, there's too damn many types of TVs.
2036350	2041992	There's the widescreen, and there's the plasma, and there's the projection, and the LCD, and then there's 4x3s.
2043292	2047433	It is too overwhelming, and I consider myself somewhat technically inclined.
2047493	2054075	I mean, I know how to, you know, do a radio show on the internet with friends, you know, but I can't figure out what TV I want.
2055216	2056716	Is that freaking sad, or what?
2058017	2060217	Well, stop watching TV, just download it all on your computer.
2060697	2063558	But see, this is the thing, I'm not buying a TV for TV.
2064639	2066639	I'm buying a TV for my DVDs and games.
2067479	2069120	Laser pointer for iPod?
2070248	2072049	No, I'm not getting a laser pointer for my iPhone.
2072609	2075050	No, I'm sorry, this just... Anyway.
2076270	2080511	You know, we actually are going to be buying a... We want to get a widescreen TV.
2081252	2082392	You know what all I'm going to use it for?
2082412	2083932	Video games.
2084513	2084773	Yeah.
2086013	2088594	And Dan's all like, I can watch this movie, I can watch this movie.
2089254	2091375	We haven't discussed a single TV show.
2091855	2093735	All he watches is that 70s show.
2094336	2098497	And all I watch is basically all day watching him play Fire Emblem.
2103098	2103698	Here's the thing.
2105058	2109479	Sure, I could tell by walking in there which one of those TVs was the prettiest TV.
2109539	2116421	Of course, that huge 52-inch widescreen LCD plasma super-duper HDTV was obviously the best one.
2116941	2125683	But let's face it, boys and girls, I'm doing a radio show on the Internet, not on New York over-the-air radio.
2125723	2129484	I don't quite have a lot of money to spend on nice TVs.
2130584	2147143	so I have to find something that's in the middle somewhere where it's a nice TV but affordable and I think just right now is a bad time for TVs because I think they're going to come down in price by the end of the year at least that's what I hope is that there'll be a price war this Christmas and they'll come down I even saw a story on Yahoo the other day it said they were going to come down in price soon enough so
2149165	2160249	Alright, anyway, so instead of getting the TV, I ended up buying a DVD kit for my Xbox because it's just a long story about the setup of our house, but I needed one, trust me.
2161090	2167012	And F Microsoft for having to, you have to buy a DVD kit to turn your Xbox into a DVD player, that sucks.
2167392	2170954	But I must admit it is a very nice DVD player because you can do Zoom and all that stuff, so it's cool.
2171814	2173855	I also picked up Fable for the Xbox.
2174824	2175445	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
2194975	2196517	That was pretty much my week and my day.
2198020	2201666	Going back to work this week was good because I got to get back into the swing of things.
2202106	2207836	It was kind of refreshing, believe it or not, to go back to work after being in LA for a week and stay out of place and everything.
2207876	2208277	So it was nice.
2210655	2214279	Let's move on to some Bomani-related things.
2214779	2219544	We are going to do a premiere of a brand new DDR Ultramix 3 song.
2219925	2224730	Funny enough, go figure, this is a song that originally showed up in our cage match.
2225811	2228154	And if you might remember DDR Ultramix 2...
2229375	2229455	D.D.R.
2250911	2253952	So, maybe our cage matches were something after all.
2254012	2256493	So tune in tonight because there might be a new DDR song in it.
2256913	2259574	Anyway, here's this new song that's announced for DDR Ultramix 3.
2260074	2261815	It was not in the E3 demo.
2263095	2268477	It was actually announced by the artist himself on his website, our old buddy Middyhead, who we interviewed a little while ago.
2268497	2269678	We've got to get him back on the show.
2270018	2273039	Because he's got not only this, but he's got the Jelly Kiss remix.
2273599	2277720	And he said on his site that there is something else as well.
2277820	2279421	So, here it is.
2280379	2282644	Midi Head, a brand new song for Ultramix 3.
2282685	2284850	You're going to be dancing to this one in the fall.
2285932	2287516	Raise Your Hands is the name of this song.
2287576	2289641	And we'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.
2385225	2385887	Thanks for watching!
2454742	2465188	Light in the mist as a DJ assist, shouting out to the fans Raise your hands, raise your hands Raise your hands, raise your hands Raise your hands
2501171	2501812	Thanks for watching!
2547950	2549471	We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
2569546	2575630	Um, that will be edited down a little bit, and I think that's going to be a pretty kick-butt song when it's edited down.
2575890	2578512	I love the beat in that song, so it's going to be neat, I think.
2579092	2583335	Um, if they edit out the singing.
2586217	2587497	Burn all our bridges, alright.
2589619	2592641	Um... It was really good, honestly it was.
2592901	2593101	Yeah.
2593942	2595202	And it does sound better than Politary.
2595783	2596003	Mm-hmm.
2596567	2597428	So that's something.
2597889	2598029	Yep.
2598690	2599010	Alright.
2599651	2601313	So I wanted to play that for you guys out there.
2602515	2605960	Orange Lounge Radio giving you new Bomani music as soon as we can dig it up.
2607260	2610102	Play a new song from the new song pack from Xbox.
2610142	2611603	Actually, I think it's two song packs to go.
2611623	2612464	We're a little late on it.
2612804	2622651	But let's face it, boys and girls, at least me was in the middle of the move with the new studio and everything, so I didn't have a chance to get on Xbox Live previously and check out the song pack.
2623051	2625833	Although I have to say, after downloading it, I kind of dig it.
2626033	2627394	I like the new song packs.
2627754	2629195	So, good stuff.
2629476	2629876	Good stuff.
2630751	2634494	Alright, let's move on to something else going on in the Millennium community right now.
2634534	2635755	Kind of a big story this week.
2636435	2643801	A lot of exposure happening for the new games, thanks to E3, for the new DDR.
2643821	2646103	And of course, Beatmania is even getting out there.
2646423	2650846	Some people are kind of questioning, is this Beatmania thing going to catch on here in the US?
2650906	2653428	It was a big risk in a way Konami was taking.
2654409	2659493	Jason Ian has been trying to get Beatmania over here for a long, long time, and it took this long, finally.
2660133	2660734	Let's come out here.
2662835	2666837	In fact, Game Informer, isn't that Game Stomps Magazine?
2666877	2676003	Game Informer Online put Beatmania number 9 on its top 10 list of E3 showstoppers.
2676343	2684488	That's not bad when you consider you've got, oh, I don't know, three new consoles and new technologies and the new Zelda and everything else to compete with.
2684808	2687810	That's really a pretty good showing for a little game from Japan.
2689707	2694251	CNN, talking about Karaoke Revolution Party, as well as MSNBC.
2695232	2714108	Very interesting that Karaoke Revolution Party seems to get a lot of the attention, but, you know, I think for those of us not in the hardcore, I can kind of see where Karaoke Revolution is more of an accessible game, because everybody can at least try to sing, but not everybody can really dance.
2715982	2718723	Some people just can't dance, but everybody can try and sing.
2720223	2721304	It's a game you play with your voice.
2724485	2732027	So, because of all this exposure, Konami, for whatever reason, decided to put this poll on their site.
2733367	2739569	And so they're actually asking on their site, which upcoming music game are you most looking forward to?
2740563	2745727	Karaoke Revolution Party, Beatmania, DDR Extreme 2, or DDR Ultramix 3?
2747188	2749210	Which one of these four do you guys think would be in the lead?
2752132	2757577	Oh, I already know the answer to this, but... Well, then let me ask DarkSakura, which one of these three do you think would be in the lead?
2757717	2758297	The list?
2758758	2763401	Karaoke Revolution Party, Beatmania, DDR Extreme 2, or DDR Ultramix 3?
2764082	2766344	Well, personally, I put Beatmania at the top of the list.
2768177	2773159	Beatmania is currently in third place with 4% of the vote.
2776680	2778300	Here's what happened, boys and girls.
2778340	2782962	There was a pretty legit thing going on where all the results were really somewhat neck and neck.
2783262	2785843	Beatmania and DDR Extreme 2 leading for a little bit.
2786603	2787023	And then...
2788186	2798370	Somebody decided to launch a script because currently DDR Ultramix 3 has 73% of the vote with 83,096 votes.
2800110	2804592	I think that's more people than are registered on DDR Freak, if I'm not mistaking.
2804712	2805552	Do you believe you're right?
2806593	2808793	So somehow this puzzles me.
2811074	2813435	The 83,000 people voted for Ultramix 3.
2813675	2814155	Yeah, right.
2814535	2814935	Yeah, right.
2814975	2816336	Somebody out there is running a script.
2818143	2825105	Why would somebody feel the need to run a script to put false votes in this poll?
2826045	2827666	For Ultramix 3, nonetheless?
2828266	2840529	I mean, don't get me wrong, I think the DDR Ultramix games are some of the best things that have happened to us forever, but we all knew, going into E3, we all knew that it was inevitable we would get an Ultramix 3 and an Extreme 2.
2840709	2844490	What we didn't know, we didn't know we were getting Beatmania here in the U.S.,
2845202	2849306	For the record, 53,163 members of DDR Freak.
2849547	2849887	Thank you.
2850248	2855954	So over 30,000 more people than are registered on DDR Freak placed to vote for Ultramix 3.
2856755	2857015	Right.
2857295	2857716	Yeah, right.
2857956	2858356	Let me see.
2858456	2860639	I bet if I reloaded this frame right now...
2864758	2865218	Oh, never mind.
2865599	2866739	They did stop running this script.
2866779	2867760	Okay, I don't see it anymore.
2868301	2879529	But for a while, some of the message boards were saying, dude, every time you click reload on the poll results, you can see that Ultramix 3 jumps up by like five or six votes each time.
2879809	2881350	So obviously somebody was running a script.
2884491	2886032	But why did you feel the need to run a script?
2886072	2891236	We did not know that Beatmania was going to be coming before E3, so this is something we should be backing.
2891536	2893977	Same thing with Karaoke Revolution Party, in a way.
2894097	2904384	I know it's kind of the stepchild of the Bomani series, for those of us that are core, you know, been into the games for a long time, but that sing and dance thing, we weren't expecting that, really.
2904444	2905325	At least I wasn't.
2906806	2912570	I was just expecting Karaoke Revolution Volume 4 with just, you know, more songs, same old shit, different game, right?
2914008	2918126	but now we get karaoke revolution party which is you know being a little bit innovative so that's kinda neat
2920236	2922277	But somebody felt the need out there to run a script.
2922317	2933440	By the way, somebody out there apparently decided that they're sad that Karaoke Revolution is falling behind because they're running a script for Karaoke Revolution Party voting as well, which is up to now 20% of the vote.
2933980	2934840	23,724 votes.
2935020	2945283	I somehow doubt that's legit, especially when you consider that DDR Extreme 2, which probably sells better the series Extreme than any of these games, DDR Extreme 2, 2,129 votes.
2945303	2946143	1% of the vote.
2950629	2951651	Yeah, right.
2953575	2957443	So do you think a Konami rep is going to look at this and go, yeah, this makes sense.
2958424	2961826	Do you think a Konami rep even gives a shit about this poll, honestly?
2962247	2967150	This is the part that surprised me, is that it was like the news on like half the Bomani sites out there.
2967170	2971854	Not that I blame them, because it is kind of cool that Konami's putting it on their front page.
2972234	2974456	But I think people read into it way too much.
2974516	2982622	I think people assume that, oh my gosh, because Konami put this on their front page poll, this is gonna make or break the future of Bomani Games.
2983002	2983082	No.
2984207	2985948	All these games were shown at E3.
2986329	2993314	All these games had press releases and release dates, even though some of them weren't so specific, release dates were attached to them.
2993794	2998938	Unlike some games shown at E3, Duke Nukem Forever, these games will come out eventually.
2999478	3001539	You had Duke Nukem Forever at E3 this year?
3001579	3002580	Years ago, they did.
3002840	3005602	I was going to say, wow, they actually had it shown?
3006043	3011967	You don't have to vote for this game over and over and over again for it to show up.
3013325	3016766	This poll is not going to make or break the future of the Ultramix series.
3016826	3017746	I hate to break it to you.
3018166	3021247	This poll is not going to make or break the Beatmania series.
3021987	3026568	So take a little rest in that, those of you guys that are pissed off that Beatmania has only got 4% of the vote.
3026808	3027428	Nobody cares.
3028108	3029469	You want to know what Konami cares about?
3029929	3032989	When the game comes out, they want people to buy it.
3034190	3035710	And you can't run a script for that.
3036997	3040439	So if you truly support the games, I hope you're going to buy them when they come out.
3040819	3044441	Because if not enough people buy Beatmania when it comes out, you know what they're going to say?
3045181	3048303	They're going to say the same thing they said with Guitar Freaks in Japan.
3049003	3049384	Fuck it.
3051145	3051905	Your thoughts on this.
3051985	3052265	Loki.
3053366	3054907	This is just an opinion poll.
3054947	3055747	Who gives a crap?
3056708	3057308	It doesn't matter.
3057348	3058048	It doesn't mean anything.
3058108	3061330	It's just... Ooh, let's see what the opinion is.
3061650	3063191	Just like on the Ear Freak polls.
3063251	3063811	I mean, come on.
3063831	3064792	Those don't mean anything.
3065700	3066501	It's the same damn thing.
3066541	3076487	And we don't want to belittle, and the polls on our website, they don't mean anything either, honestly, and I hate to belittle it, but the honest thing is, it's just something, it's a fun poll.
3076927	3081370	It's just, you know, how many of you guys in the room thought the last Star Wars movie sucked?
3081630	3084191	You know, and then, you know, you poll, and it's fun.
3084332	3084692	Oh, really?
3085372	3086473	Who knew I was in the minority?
3086753	3089695	It's a teehee fun poll, all these polls on websites.
3092512	3094853	This is in the MTV Video Game Awards, folks.
3094993	3095334	Oh, yeah.
3095554	3097034	You remember this years ago?
3097835	3099596	Halo and Dance Dance Revolution.
3099616	3103798	Didn't J-Dog from DDR Freak, of all people, write the script that did this?
3106479	3109581	For the... Like, remember... When was it?
3109641	3112082	It was either 2005... I want to say it was going into 2004.
3114326	3116087	Thank you for watching!
3135212	3143980	and in the end, according to the website, DDR was number one and we were all, yeah, DDR is going to be number one on the top 20 countdown, yeah.
3144360	3144920	Guess what?
3145801	3148984	When it was actually put out on TV, guess where DDR landed on the poll?
3149785	3152827	Last place, 20th, last place.
3153207	3155429	Your voting on the website didn't mean shit.
3156650	3159673	Now, the intentions back then were good.
3159953	3162195	I don't think that, anyway.
3162799	3163019	What?
3163460	3164180	No, finish your thought.
3164981	3167023	Well, the intentions back then were different.
3167623	3171387	Because MTV, that's different.
3171467	3172908	You don't know what they're going to do.
3172988	3176071	So I understand why people... MTV is synonymous with crap anyway.
3176091	3177152	Well, yeah, I understand that.
3177172	3188082	Their whole thinking, which was just insane anyways, was like, if it gets on MTV as number one, then maybe Konami will realize, well, the fans love it, and they'll put it on Arcade Mix.
3188402	3195027	Yeah, Konami will realize the fans love it when stores are sold out of it and you can't find it on shelves anywhere.
3195448	3196328	That's when they'll know.
3196709	3203814	For instance, Katamari Damacy, do you think we'd ever be seeing a sequel if that game wasn't impossible to find?
3205075	3205275	No.
3206436	3208558	That game is selling like mad.
3208598	3211160	That's why there's going to be a sequel to Katamari Damacy.
3213180	3219449	No MTV poll, no poll over at Namco's site or anything had to dictate that new game coming out.
3221432	3224657	Numbers, money, that's what they look at as the bottom line.
3224677	3225779	I think we've covered the poll thing enough.
3227766	3231689	I don't even want to dedicate this much effort into talking about this.
3231710	3235953	But it just irritates me that somebody, I mean, why would somebody do this?
3235993	3239176	They'd be like, hey, look at how big my internet penis is.
3239256	3241538	It takes up 73% of the screen right now.
3241858	3243439	Nobody will ever be as big as Jason's.
3245821	3246382	Recognize.
3250819	3254740	Just remember, if you think this poll is going to do any good, just watch what happened on the MTV thing.
3255240	3257761	The answers are already predetermined.
3257781	3262442	So this is what's going to happen if they allow internet voting for presidents?
3263422	3263982	Absolutely.
3264002	3267743	That's why it'll never happen, at least in the next 20 years.
3271804	3272464	But who knows?
3272504	3273684	I've been proven wrong before.
3273704	3274424	We'll see what happens.
3276405	3277385	How about a break time, kids?
3278922	3279544	How about it?
3288069	3288909	At least I liked it.
3288969	3293450	I don't know what my co-hosts will think, but I'm entitled to my Wii song once in a while, I think.
3293830	3297191	So this is Vanilla Ninja with Liar is what we're going to start off this break with.
3297651	3301852	And then also in this break, we'll play other stuff, too.
3303512	3304132	Some potpourri.
3304412	3306513	And then when we come back from this break, some more Bomani news.
3306533	3312354	Tonight's cage match, of course, your calls via the Skype line, www.orangeloungeradio.com.
3313014	3316215	Click on Interact With Us, and we'll start taking some calls via Skype when we come back.
3316275	3316775	Sound good?
3317962	3318462	Yeah!
3318482	3322624	Alright, we'll be back after this from Guitar Freaks, Drum Mania V, Manila Ninja, Liar.
3349543	3356267	I'm feeling about to feel in love, I'm really good at hiding on the road, you know
3373562	3377689	If you wanna lie to me again, the rhythm of your fate is on the end Just go there, and stay there, lie down
3391505	3401871	I'm feeling about to be in love I'm growing to the heart of all the world There's no way, there's no way If you wanna like me again Then if you want to take it all, yeah, just come with me
3455945	3457446	Can you be a fantasy?
3457466	3459547	Give me ecstasy Can you be a fantasy?
3483991	3484572	Thanks for watching!
3521978	3534967	And the heat of the night, the night And the heat of the night, the night Why did our feelings die in action When we fought for satisfaction But our hearts end at the well Save me
3551117	3551539	What?
3551779	3553386	The love of magic
3646613	3647755	Thanks for watching!
3689065	3693067	This is the way we rock, this is the way we ride, as we demonstrate, as we demonstrate.
3693087	3695249	From the steps wide to arms loud, this DDR sucks!
3719109	3719470	TGP-O
3727307	3732588	We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio and episode number 144 for you guys.
3732848	3740270	You know, it's kind of sad because it is a three-day weekend and typically on the three-day weekends we do our drunk shows, but you may notice we're not doing that tonight.
3740290	3742690	That's because Jamie and I are going clubbing after tonight's show.
3742770	3743691	We're getting our goth on.
3743711	3746571	Because we don't get to go out on Sunday nights very often, so we're going to go out tonight.
3746651	3748412	And Loki, well, I don't know what his excuse is.
3748492	3750092	Oh yeah, he drove over here so he can't really drink.
3751192	3751972	He'll go club seals.
3752613	3754433	Yeah, he'll go club seals instead of clubbing.
3754993	3756193	I'm going to have me some Guinness.
3757034	3759915	I totally want to drink at the club, man.
3760255	3761015	I can have one drink.
3761155	3763295	You can have one and then not drink anything for three hours.
3763456	3764536	That's pretty much what I get to do.
3764736	3765336	Drink a lot of water.
3766236	3770838	Because it takes, I think, two hours for a high metabolism to oxidize alcohol.
3771118	3773398	For a big guy like me, though, my body can handle a lot.
3774159	3774559	Lightweight.
3774779	3775879	You're lightweight and you know it.
3775919	3776679	Not anymore.
3777420	3778020	Not anymore.
3778380	3779180	Maybe in college.
3780621	3781641	Maybe before I was 21.
3784136	3784816	Oh yeah, hi kids.
3785236	3786817	I don't know, man.
3786957	3790678	I remember you falling out of the chair during all the drunk shows.
3790698	3793099	Yeah, I seem to recall the last drunk show we had.
3793679	3800181	I was lying down in the hallway, kicking the wall, trying to run up the wall, and I was yelling, I'm in the Matrix, I'm in the Matrix.
3800901	3806442	And I don't even remember how we got to that on our radio show, but this was on air.
3806462	3808303	I remember eating half a box of waffles.
3808783	3810124	Which I paid you back for.
3810284	3810624	Finally.
3810725	3811925	I remember you paid me back.
3811986	3816229	I bought you a big old box of industrial-sized waffles.
3816369	3817109	And they were eaten.
3817450	3818991	So we'll have to do another drunk show sometime.
3819011	3820532	I'm happy because I got a toaster today.
3821172	3822273	A bagel-sized toaster.
3822293	3824635	And I hate bagels, but still a toaster.
3824855	3826016	They're good for cooking waffles in.
3826737	3826937	Yes.
3827277	3832181	You know, my friend told me that he was going to get me as a housewarming present a Hello Kitty toaster.
3833001	3833702	I'm still waiting.
3833722	3835103	What the hell is up with Hello Kitty?
3835143	3836004	I swear to God, it's like...
3837295	3838756	It's almost like the Nazi Revolution.
3838796	3841077	I mean, it's like they have everything Hello Kitty.
3841197	3843958	It's just, Hello Kitty is going to take over the world.
3844679	3845659	Sanrio World!
3846400	3848621	Did you play the Hello Kitty Roller Rescue at E3?
3848801	3849941	No, but I saw you play it.
3850001	3850742	So cute!
3851622	3852823	So cute!
3853023	3853923	So cute!
3859326	3860827	I like the suggestion from our chatroom.
3861147	3862668	Drunk podcast episode!
3863772	3866174	Yeah, it'd be really great for us with all the additional exposure.
3866194	3867775	We could bring the recorder, though, to the club.
3869317	3870477	What are we going to get at the club?
3870998	3871899	Nobody talks.
3871979	3872759	It's Gothic night.
3872779	3873440	Nobody talks.
3874261	3876202	They act pretentious and ignore each other.
3876322	3877163	At the club.
3877463	3881867	Can you actually hear someone talking four inches away from you at the club?
3882387	3883028	Yeah, seriously.
3885750	3889133	Yes, boys and girls, Jamie and I go to the Goth Club on Sunday nights.
3890229	3891829	I go every week on Thursday.
3891949	3894390	Now, don't knock it till you tried it.
3894970	3901851	I know that, you know, a lot of you guys are in, like, high school, college, and you probably... Either you are a goth kid... You're emo!
3901971	3902892	Stop crying, emo kid!
3902952	3905352	Either you are a goth kid or you make fun of the goth kids.
3905792	3909513	So... Give him a break.
3911093	3913754	Honestly, folks, you should be dating the goth kids.
3914654	3919175	I mean, because they're the ones that later on down the road end up being really slutty.
3920490	3921251	Now stop.
3922191	3925094	Hey, I am only going off of personal experience, okay?
3925114	3928056	Okay, I knew a goth girl.
3928096	3933680	She wasn't very popular in high school, but she got out of high school, pierced like crazy, and then became a stripper.
3934361	3935161	Was she pierced?
3936262	3936602	Uh-huh.
3936723	3937003	Wow.
3938581	3938941	Every place.
3939222	3950835	But anyways, um, yeah, so that was actually the last time I went to the goth club was with this chick, and, um, because when I went there, then, um, some guy was trying to proposition me for sex.
3953999	3957103	Like, they wanted to take me home and give me money and
3958345	3959086	Have their way with me.
3959246	3961528	And that was the end of the golf club.
3965270	3966832	Have I ever taken you to the gay club?
3967232	3967452	No.
3967772	3968913	Oh, you need to go sometime.
3969173	3970054	I like karaoke there.
3970314	3971755	Even though I don't sing anything, I just watch.
3972716	3973617	I sing.
3973837	3975178	We need this to be like a mission.
3975198	3976699	We need to take Loki to the gay bar.
3976960	3979001	I know that Nellie wants to go.
3979461	3980042	I know she does.
3983581	3984162	I don't really care.
3984182	3986884	It's not like it's going to be like, oh my god, homosexuals!
3986904	3987204	Oh no!
3987304	3988305	I know you only lived with one.
3988325	3989887	I would just be like, oh whatever, I'm bored.
3990127	3991588	You only lived with one for how long?
3993830	3994310	Seriously.
3994691	3996773	You didn't catch gay from living with me, did you?
3997693	3998294	I don't think so.
3998714	3999455	I caught gay from you.
4000216	4001217	Remember the Pepsi bong?
4003719	4006661	This is years ago at our first March Madness.
4008183	4008703	And, uh...
4010146	4018172	It was Shiggle selling these huge things that look like a big bone, but I call them the Pepsi bong.
4019233	4022415	And I was passing it to Rob to take a drink.
4022476	4023817	I was like, I don't have any diseases.
4024317	4026759	And then he took a drink, passed it back, and I started drinking it.
4026779	4028120	And he goes, I do, I have gays.
4028180	4030742	I was like, oh my god, I caught gay.
4030762	4031502	And then I hugged Irene.
4034687	4037209	Yeah, very excellent point made in the chat room.
4037589	4040712	You guys should not tease the goth kids, you people that listen to the show.
4041152	4042674	You should not be teasing the goth kids.
4042974	4044155	You fucking play DDR.
4045136	4045396	Yep.
4047017	4049119	Correction, I do not play DDR.
4051021	4052062	I just do a radio show.
4052082	4053222	What, you play in the groove?
4053623	4054403	That's even worse.
4054423	4056425	I don't play in the groove.
4057046	4061830	No, honestly, but I think doing a radio show about DDR is probably worse than playing DDR.
4063407	4066048	Let me do a quick imitation of Jamie and I at the goth club.
4071189	4074691	Oh, Jamie, I'm feeling so gothic.
4076351	4078192	I'm so gothic, Jamie.
4078412	4079292	Okay, you know what?
4079332	4091036	That when the night comes, so do I. Jamie, I'm so gothic, bats fly out of my ass.
4093706	4095207	I could make a comment about that.
4095707	4099548	Let's go on the dance floor and swing our hands about.
4100149	4106051	Let's close our eyes and let our hands move freely above in the air and let the music flow into our body.
4106311	4109373	Let's see how many people we can pile in the cage.
4110233	4112554	Oh, I get so turned on by cages.
4113114	4115735	I'm gonna make out with that thing over there.
4116295	4119337	I can't tell if it's man or woman but it has a cute corset.
4119617	4121278	Oh, that's Jessica's purse.
4123107	4146265	I will make love to it even so I'm feeling so tragic I'm going to go outside and contemplate jumping off the curb I'm going to slit my wrists and then go to work tomorrow That's emo Oh, I'm sorry That's emo Anyways You know what I do?
4146946	4151990	I sit on the bench and get drunk That's what I do And then I watch everybody, I'm like
4152970	4154651	I'm too fucking drunk to move.
4154971	4155571	That's what I do.
4156472	4159213	The golf club for me is all about planning my outfit.
4159493	4161274	Because I get to be as eccentric as I want to be.
4161594	4165696	I'm thinking about wearing my I hate myself and I want to die shirt from English.com tonight.
4165716	4166756	Because that's always a fun choice.
4166776	4169878	I have my, uh, the one that you bought me.
4170678	4171518	Oh yeah, the reviver.
4171538	4174200	It would be fun to go to the golf club wearing all white.
4174700	4175100	People do.
4177461	4181623	I've seen, dude, you have to go to see the guy that dresses up like Michael Jackson.
4184150	4204220	that guy is my fucking hero one glove and the hat and everything and he fucking moonwalks to goth music that's awesome that's so weird that is awesome I gotta dress up like Pee Wee Herman and go there or something no actually no I don't sigh
4206576	4211440	Oh yeah, we talk about video games on this show once in a while, don't we?
4211460	4212761	What was that on Saturday Night Live?
4212821	4215383	I don't know, I don't watch that.
4215423	4216224	That was great.
4236824	4237906	That actually amused me to no end.
4250829	4252130	I think Sarah Michelle Gellar.
4252150	4254891	That one was great.
4255491	4256452	Robert Downey Jr.
4256492	4257232	was the one I remember.
4257292	4257532	Anyway.
4257672	4258293	That was great.
4258553	4263455	We're going to open up the Skype line now to try and steer us back on to talking about games.
4263515	4267657	I'm going to open up the Skype line, www.orangelandreda.com and click on interact with us.
4268077	4270218	Funny thing is though, okay, this is the other thing.
4270438	4271559	Before I got off on the...
4273482	4275223	Thank you for watching!
4292047	4296330	Also, what's interesting is that... Oh, that's the cool thing about the fact that my friend brought over Star Wars.
4296510	4299511	He brought me a big thing of vodka and I have orange juice at home.
4300112	4313739	Because it's part of a three-day weekend, Memorial Day weekend, we typically have less listeners on three-day weekend because people decide they can go out and get a life because it's, you know, another weekend night or something.
4313799	4316680	I don't know where you kids get off thinking that.
4316801	4317641	Wherever they can.
4320903	4321223	All right.
4323720	4331907	Well, the skypline's open, and I'm noticing, per our list, there's a whopping two people online, so I'm not thinking the skypline's going to be a good idea tonight.
4331927	4334008	We might have to go back in the goth talk again.
4334749	4335369	No, you know what?
4335389	4336510	We'll get Paris Hilton chat.
4336610	4338011	House of Wax just came out, you know.
4338532	4342135	You know, I heard that movie kind of sucked, but I heard that she doesn't die quick enough.
4342435	4344837	I actually had free tickets to that, and I threw them away.
4345580	4349243	I just want to download the scene where she dies so that I can cheat in the industry for making that.
4349263	4352546	I don't know why you would, because that seems like an awful lot of work to me, but I guess you could do that.
4352566	4354648	Have you seen the new Paris Hilton commercial?
4371337	4374178	Yeah, why are people getting an uproar with that?
4374258	4378160	It's just Paris Hilton being stupid and slutty with a burger.
4378700	4385223	Is it just me, or is she really the wrong person to be selling, let's wait here, hamburgers?
4386043	4388324	Does the bitch look like she eats anything?
4388644	4388984	No.
4389385	4392926	She seems more of like a sausage hot dog type person to me.
4393026	4396207	I don't know if she can handle... The burger is bigger than she is, okay?
4396287	4397148	Honestly, folks.
4397848	4399569	The burger is bigger than she is.
4400373	4403654	She'd be like, oh my god, can you cut that lettuce in half, please?
4403675	4405015	That is way too much for me.
4406116	4407136	Like, oh my god!
4408257	4412438	The whole thing was just an excuse to use her tagline, that's hot.
4413619	4414920	Which isn't even really a tagline.
4415280	4416200	Why does she have a tagline?
4416260	4417161	Why does she have a show?
4417541	4419422	All she's done is like, oh, there we go.
4421563	4422663	Saved by a phone call.
4422683	4424124	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4425066	4429028	Thank freaking God, stop the Paris Hilton crap.
4429168	4431469	Actually, it was kind of inadvertent.
4431509	4436050	We actually didn't mean to start doing the Paris Hilton chat, but I had to get that out about the commercial.
4438191	4439212	You could have spared all of us.
4439272	4439892	You really could have.
4439912	4440292	I'm sorry.
4440332	4441332	Hi, Jason, how are you?
4441353	4442493	Hi, Rob.
4442553	4446274	Now, this is the man with the internet penis, ladies and gentlemen.
4447155	4449236	No scripting on Konami polls needed.
4449676	4452037	He just keeps pressing the vote button over and over and over again.
4452877	4453498	Oh yeah, it's me.
4453658	4454078	I'm sorry.
4456100	4456200	No.
4456420	4457681	Did you write the script, Jason?
4458201	4458402	No.
4458502	4458782	Did you?
4459422	4459522	No.
4459542	4459963	Are you lying?
4460543	4460683	No.
4460763	4460984	Alright.
4461664	4462184	What's on your mind?
4463566	4468429	Um, I, well, I had Paris Hilton on my mind and I really wanted it out, so.
4468890	4471452	Who hasn't had Paris Hilton sitting on their head, huh?
4472136	4473417	Well, me until now.
4474718	4475618	Thanks, Rob.
4475678	4476078	I'm sorry.
4476459	4479421	See, now we're even getting other people calling in, but those people will have to wait because you're online.
4479441	4480401	No, it's alright.
4481402	4483083	We haven't talked to you since E3 was over.
4483123	4486285	What did you think of the old E3 and Konami's showing at E3?
4487125	4490728	Everybody was taunting me because I couldn't go, and it made me really, really sad.
4490828	4491948	Go tell them to go to hell.
4492909	4494010	Oh, believe me, I already did.
4494170	4494690	Oh, that's good.
4495402	4495883	That's mean.
4495904	4496825	That's a mean thing to do.
4496845	4497747	Well, you'll go next year.
4497968	4498409	It'll be fine.
4498449	4499150	Oh, damn straight.
4499190	4499551	You better.
4500252	4501114	I'll definitely go.
4501375	4502978	What do you think of Konami's lineup this year?
4503820	4506144	I want to see a full thing of the Groovaloos.
4507701	4509763	Oh, yeah, you know, I'm surprised.
4509783	4512945	There was like a minute-long clip that showed up on LiveJournal.
4513025	4515688	I know that Mel got a video of it.
4515908	4516728	Did Mel get a video of it?
4516748	4517209	At some point.
4517289	4521012	I don't know what he's doing with the video or where it went, but he got a video.
4521032	4522493	Mel works for us now, right?
4522813	4524174	So maybe we can hook something up.
4525215	4526176	Maybe we can hook something up.
4526816	4530239	I will ask Mel about that just for you, Jason, if he did get a video of that.
4530559	4532181	I'm surprised Shane didn't get a video of that.
4532221	4533502	Miklatov, Miklatov.
4534580	4536482	How many times did the Groovaloos perform throughout the whole thing?
4536502	4538044	I think it was like three, four, and three.
4538124	4539706	So it was like ten times they performed.
4540086	4542208	Mikltov was at least at seven of them.
4542529	4542969	At least.
4544471	4545312	I took a bunch of pictures.
4545732	4546112	You did?
4546232	4548034	Which you can see on orangeonjournal.com.
4548215	4549356	Oh, what a lovely plug.
4549676	4551378	Lots of Groovaloos pictures on orangeonjournal.com.
4551438	4552459	And the Q1 grinned at me.
4553160	4553961	He was upside down.
4556604	4557304	You're all cute.
4557464	4560945	That's a good reminder that our E3 picture galleries are coming online.
4561285	4561665	Get this.
4562025	4564026	We're only through two days of the show.
4565626	4567606	500 pictures already on the site.
4569067	4570807	And only one of them with me in it.
4571947	4574388	And we wonder why we're having bandwidth issues right now.
4577868	4580169	I smile every time I see an iPod commercial now.
4580749	4581089	Why is that?
4582311	4587512	Were you the one that told me that the Groovaloos were the iPod commercial mosaic people?
4587552	4587672	Yes.
4587712	4588572	That's what I was told anyway.
4588592	4590953	The Groovaloos are the iPod shadow dancers.
4591473	4596093	And the thing is that they are also going to be the shadow dancers in one of the new DDRs.
4597214	4604155	We never got a clear answer whether it was Ultramix 3 or Extreme 2, but one of them, the Groovaloos are actually being modeled.
4604535	4605335	Is it Ultramix 3?
4605975	4608816	That's what they kept saying at the show, but then I heard someone at the end say, no, it's Extreme 2.
4609496	4610736	So nobody seems to know.
4611511	4615056	Are they going to be the competitive dancers in the quest mode in Ultramix 3 perhaps?
4629844	4632946	What little bit I played of quest mode, it wasn't really set up like that.
4633066	4636268	It was very similar to Mission, in a way.
4636869	4637329	It was a thought.
4637349	4638690	Yeah, that was a good thought.
4638710	4639710	It would be an interesting one.
4640071	4640391	Very good.
4641131	4646475	By the way, also included in DarkSakura's pictures, tons of screen caps.
4646735	4649297	You want to see what the song banners for some of the new songs look like?
4649397	4649877	She got it.
4650417	4651698	Got all of them for DDR Mario.
4652018	4653519	Yeah, you want to see DDR Mario?
4654820	4655241	Go look.
4655421	4655881	It's all there.
4656468	4657209	Yeah, you people.
4657470	4661076	Go look at our website and don't put us over bandwidth.
4661116	4662799	Yeah, don't forget to look into that, Jason.
4663039	4663640	I'm working on that.
4663781	4664462	I'm already working on it.
4664482	4664863	Kisses.
4665444	4665724	All right.
4667387	4668549	Anything else you want to share with our listeners?
4669421	4670802	I just wanted you guys to stop.
4672563	4673004	That's fine.
4673244	4674625	We'll go off the air right now.
4674745	4676046	We got a goth club to get to.
4676086	4678148	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
4678728	4685053	We got coffins to sleep in and, you know, familiars to cast and, you know.
4685113	4685973	Okay, you know what?
4686254	4687895	Stop talking about my private life.
4691958	4692338	All right.
4693979	4695841	I guess we'll hang up and let somebody else call in now, Jason.
4696354	4701457	I still want I Feel Toy Remix to be in Beatmania USA.
4701717	4703899	I think that would make a very, very good crossover.
4704099	4706840	I'll play I Feel Toy Remix just for you later, and you can imagine it.
4707381	4707761	How's that sound?
4707781	4708862	That would make me very happy.
4709022	4709682	All right, we'll do that.
4710323	4711003	Thank you, Rob.
4711043	4711823	You're welcome.
4711863	4712544	Bye, Jamie.
4712584	4713084	Bye, Matt.
4713564	4713805	Bye.
4713845	4715386	No, you cannot leave us.
4715566	4717007	You must come up here and visit.
4717707	4718507	Oh, God, I want to.
4719688	4720629	We kidnap.
4721209	4721489	All right.
4721930	4725912	Come to our dog castle, where we all gossip.
4726974	4727934	Bye, Jason.
4728314	4728815	Bye, Rob.
4730095	4732876	You know who the original old school goth is?
4734876	4735296	Elvira?
4735777	4735897	No.
4736977	4739658	One, two, ah, ah, ah.
4740658	4744279	Three, four, ah, ah, ah.
4745039	4745579	You know what?
4745860	4746940	We had Count Chocula, too.
4747480	4748080	Oh, that's true.
4748120	4749180	Count Chocula was goth.
4749200	4750441	Hi, you're on Orange and Orange Radio.
4751448	4752129	Hey, it's Dukes.
4752449	4753610	Hey, Dukes, what's up?
4754631	4757815	I'm bored and listening to you guys talk about the gods.
4758435	4758776	Yeah.
4759156	4763620	And it was so funny, like, as you guys were talking about that, I was watching, I was reading Maddox.
4763741	4764501	You guys ever heard of that guy?
4765002	4768586	Is that the one that makes fun of the preschool refrigerator art on his site?
4768626	4769707	Yeah, a lot more than that.
4769787	4770668	Yeah, that guy, that guy.
4770688	4771068	Okay.
4771148	4772490	Yeah, that's a pretty funny site.
4773621	4776202	Yeah, I was reading and he was talking about the gods, and it's so funny.
4776222	4778262	He just, like, destroys them.
4778422	4779942	It's hilarious.
4780042	4780822	I don't want to hear that.
4781042	4782043	Sorry, I don't want to hear it.
4782063	4789704	To be fair, we're only teasing, you know, we like everybody equally.
4789804	4790584	Except emo kids.
4790764	4791505	I mean, hi!
4791605	4793085	No, no, no.
4793845	4795125	I'm against emo kids also.
4795145	4795565	It's pretty funny.
4795605	4798266	Remember, down the road, not across the street.
4799361	4801403	I have a couple funny stories about the emo kids.
4802263	4807246	I know that, like, the arcade I go to normally, there's this kid who was just sitting on the ground, right?
4807987	4811609	And some cop guy just came up and told him, oh, you can't sit there.
4811930	4815012	So this kid just looks at the cop like, shoot him.
4816092	4818854	So he's like, God, okay, whatever, you know, I'll stand up.
4818894	4820475	And he starts, like, crying and runs away.
4820595	4821776	Like, what the hell?
4821916	4822957	You know what I don't understand?
4823017	4824838	This is one of those generational things.
4824878	4826599	This is when I really begin to feel old.
4826799	4828981	Because back in my day, they didn't have emo kids.
4831547	4832668	But this is why I don't understand.
4832788	4834468	Everybody says emo sucks.
4834589	4835309	Emo kids suck.
4835669	4838590	I've never heard anybody say, I'm an emo kid.
4839030	4839591	Leave me alone.
4841451	4844112	Nobody ever says, I want to be emo when I grow up.
4845013	4845573	Seriously.
4845693	4847194	Where are the emo kids?
4847514	4849054	Where are these people that suck?
4849395	4852336	I think you all are making fun of something that doesn't even exist.
4853527	4854007	Okay, no.
4854167	4858049	Okay, if you want to see the emo kids, just like walk around, I guess, like a mall or something.
4858309	4859950	And look for kids looking at the floor all the time.
4859970	4860530	Walk in the Hot Topic.
4861811	4862051	No, no.
4862071	4864932	When I shop at Hot Topic, they've got video game shirts.
4864972	4865312	Come on.
4866293	4866993	And cool pants.
4867453	4869394	You've got to admit Hot Topic has cool pants.
4869574	4870915	You don't have to be emo to know that.
4871855	4872816	Yeah, they're pretty cool.
4872956	4874437	And I don't even like Hot Topic much.
4877558	4877898	All right.
4879539	4881760	Anything gaming related you wanted to share with us?
4882406	4884968	Yes, I got a bunch of AAAs today.
4885269	4886130	I'm happy.
4886550	4887611	Oh, congratulations.
4887971	4890734	Now, how many new AAAs did you get?
4891354	4898261	I got AAA on Holic, AAA on Waka Laka, AAA on Sexy Planet, and I passed PSMO on Shuffle.
4903018	4904619	But that's not a triple A. You just passed it.
4904939	4906479	No, I passed it, but that's awesome.
4906679	4907599	Okay, yeah, I know, I know.
4907800	4908400	So that's four.
4908680	4911941	So, your DDR penis grew by a whole four centimeters.
4911981	4912601	How does it feel?
4913461	4913982	It feels great.
4914202	4914542	Alright.
4915802	4916082	Okay.
4916422	4916742	Alright.
4916882	4917543	I'll see you guys later.
4917583	4918343	Go hump something.
4918583	4920144	See ya.
4920164	4920424	Bye.
4920444	4920704	Bye.
4922684	4923485	That's wonderful.
4924545	4928066	I would, you know, Dr. Drew or something.
4928726	4929667	Yeah, go hump something.
4930467	4930847	For better.
4931994	4934375	Well, he's got his penis grew by four centimeters.
4934455	4935436	It's time to go hump something.
4936297	4937978	Maybe he saw the new parasol pin.
4939058	4939979	No, he AAA'd.
4940019	4940719	Weren't you listening?
4941480	4942420	Oh, I'm sorry.
4943261	4947203	I was looking for something that actually made, you know, I don't know.
4947443	4953887	You ever sign up for one of those sites like NNR or GrooveStats, I think is another one for in the groove.
4954307	4960491	Any of those sites where you can compare your DDR scores and you can issue challenges to each other and stuff like that?
4962870	4968874	Challenge 1, go outside.
4969334	4970996	Challenge 1, run around the track.
4971356	4972617	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4975399	4975799	Hello.
4977640	4978321	Housekeeping.
4980462	4983444	Welcome to my castle.
4983945	4984465	Candygram.
4985325	4987027	You are on the Orange Lounge.
4987047	4989789	No, seriously, you there?
4989829	4990229	Can you hear us?
4991021	4992102	That would be a negative.
4992843	4994144	Well, it's one of our regular callers.
4994424	4994965	Oh, he hung up.
4997347	5003712	If you kids are unsure if your Skype is working or not, give Echo123 a call, and you can always test to make sure your Skype's working.
5003732	5008877	You can't add Echo123 to your buddy list, but you can give Echo123 a call.
5009538	5013541	So give Echo123 a call, and you can test if your Skype is working and see what you sound like.
5015022	5015363	Amazing.
5016872	5019074	Because people are fundamentally stupid.
5039932	5040653	Well, I don't know.
5040693	5042355	I mean, a lot of people do this.
5042675	5059452	Like, if I were to sign up for something like that, I would do it for myself to track my own records because I believe it's the one place where In The Groove really is superior to DDR is the memory support where the memory card on PlayStation, that whole link thing, eh, not so hot.
5059752	5061995	But the USB In The Groove is awesome.
5062395	5083256	and so really with that you don't need a freaking website to track your scores but on DDR you kind of do so I could see myself signing up for a website strictly to track my scores on DDR to watch my own improvement because it feels good to watch yourself improve but the whole like challenging other people and like OMG I got one more great than you and all that stuff I don't get that who cares why who cares
5085290	5097915	No matter how good you are at DDR, or at 2DX, or at Poppin' Music, or at any of these games, or at goth dancing, or whatever, there will always be somebody better than you, somewhere out there.
5097975	5100656	You may not know it, but somebody out there is better than you.
5103237	5108899	And the person who's the best in the world, there's somebody better than them, at something else.
5111020	5114421	That was my motivational thought for today.
5117648	5120390	Regardless, somebody out there is better than you, so stop trying.
5123612	5123912	Alright.
5125353	5127394	Let's go to the cage match tonight, boys and girls.
5127454	5129015	We'll do more Skype calls later.
5129235	5134178	I think people are afraid to call in now because I wasn't really making fun of that last guy.
5134198	5135679	I mean, I was kind of congratulating him.
5135699	5138161	I don't know what your guys' problem is.
5138281	5138921	Wah, wah, wah.
5141710	5141990	Alright.
5143151	5145073	Um... We gotta go to the cage match.
5145093	5149757	But in order for me to go to the cage match, I've gotta find Loki's song that he wanted played.
5153400	5154901	I hope I can find it, or we're in trouble.
5155042	5156223	Do you remember what the file name was?
5158024	5161427	Um, I believe it started with a D. Uh-oh.
5164710	5165250	Oh, God.
5165290	5166351	Do I have to look it up again?
5168033	5168413	Maybe.
5168553	5169234	This isn't good.
5169955	5170775	It's two letters.
5170856	5173877	It starts off as something something and then dash.
5173917	5176458	I will look for that so that we don't waste too much show.
5177399	5180120	I'm going to reorder things a little bit.
5180541	5184103	Let's go into playing that song from Silent Hill 4.
5185543	5188885	And this is one of the songs that's in the new song pack.
5189005	5190525	I don't remember if it's song pack 10 or 11.
5190765	5192346	I think it's song pack 10 this song shows up in.
5192646	5194007	And it's really weird, you guys.
5194027	5195267	This is a really weird song.
5196268	5198489	And that's kind of the reason I want to play this.
5198629	5200290	They should put a dog song in there.
5201070	5204851	So that you can hear kind of how weird some of these DDR songs are getting.
5205132	5207933	So this is Waverer, the slide mix.
5208753	5210674	And we'll be back after this with the cage match.
5263726	5264426	DarkSakura.com
5303499	5304782	Thank you for watching!
5334046	5334747	Thanks for watching!
5393479	5394039	Waiverer, The Slide Mix
5418766	5422888	But you can't say there isn't a little variety in your USDDR games, so there you have it.
5424148	5424509	All right.
5426689	5433192	Before we get into tonight's cage match, I thought we'd go ahead and let Loki do a sim update if you have something for us, Loki.
5433352	5434233	That's a good question.
5434413	5439575	I don't think we do, though, but at least last time I checked, which was yesterday.
5441096	5442036	But let's give it a... Oh!
5442376	5442857	I forgot.
5443097	5444317	Actually, I forgot one the other day.
5446058	5448199	Not that you really care, but guess what?
5448817	5453948	Debt Mania, Alpha something or other, Release Candidate 3
5456284	5457564	And what can you expect in that?
5457845	5458385	I don't know.
5458565	5459465	Not much different.
5459566	5462627	But hey, it's a new version of Step Mania.
5463127	5463748	And you know what?
5463808	5466910	I completely forgot that they were even updating that thing to be honest.
5467370	5468490	Because it's been that long.
5469231	5470371	But yeah, new version.
5470391	5471952	Get it at stepmania.com.
5473273	5474834	Be sure to upgrade it.
5474954	5478236	And I think there might be a driver missing so you might have to download that too.
5478336	5480457	But it's not that hard to find.
5480497	5481257	I found it pretty quick.
5481958	5482338	But anyways.
5483859	5485500	Let's see what's going on in the sim scene.
5485520	5493022	Because I know as far as UK stuff, DDRUK hasn't released the official packs yet, but I think they're getting pretty close there.
5493062	5502566	They have to just tweak a few things on them, because they actually ripped all the music and the images and all that stuff using a certain program.
5503266	5505627	But let's see here.
5506587	5510889	Well, I'm not having much high hopes here for the fan mix stuff, but...
5513260	5513400	No.
5514101	5514421	Nothing.
5514681	5514961	Nada.
5517422	5519663	Pretty much Siberia Style 2.6 came out.
5520344	5522905	That was the one that was very similar to Techno Fiend.
5523365	5524946	I actually downloaded it and tried it out.
5525066	5525746	It's pretty cool.
5526107	5529348	It actually works with this release, Candidate 3, so that's pretty nice.
5530009	5536952	And then D3 Mix 2.5, four songs have been announced for that, but they haven't really launched anything.
5537713	5537833	And...
5539554	5546263	Really, if you want all the news, like, you know, up to date and everything, there's a website, B-Music Report, that you can go to.
5546944	5548646	And really, there's nothing there.
5549187	5550688	Ooh, wait a second.
5551470	5551910	Hold on.
5555335	5555775	Uh...
5558005	5560085	Hmm, what have we here?
5561266	5563106	Apparently, I would be wrong.
5564286	5566907	No, actually, they did announce something.
5566927	5570287	It looks like there's screenshots of FoonMix 2.
5571548	5573108	That's kind of neat.
5574148	5576888	Just basically some screenshots to show you what's going to be coming up.
5577109	5585130	And if it's not a surprise, it's up to the same quality as the original FoonMix, if not better.
5586698	5592082	So, take a look at that, and more to come soon enough.
5594644	5596945	Oh, a video.
5598046	5599287	There's a video of FunMix.
5600508	5601709	We'll check that out.
5601789	5603290	Videos will make great radio, by the way.
5603730	5606733	Well, I'm not going to play the video, because it's on a different computer.
5606753	5610775	But anyways, if you're interested, you can go to http://funmix.com
5614431	5620055	That's F-O-O-N-M-I-X dot nothing dot S-H.
5620956	5630803	I don't know what you know about these mixes here, but Laser123454321 in our chatroom is yelling about DDR9 Red has some early release version that's out.
5630943	5636387	DDR9 Red is basically the 2DX Red skin for, or theme for...
5638793	5641275	Stepmania, and DDR Extreme VS4.
5641595	5643136	I don't know what that one's all about.
5643317	5644638	It's just a DDR Extreme skin.
5645118	5645498	Oh, fun.
5646299	5647039	More skins.
5648401	5649982	Skins, skins, yeah, yeah, yeah.
5651043	5653264	Honestly, folks, stick with Siberia style 2.6.
5653545	5654946	It's the best one out there.
5656414	5657815	Alright, let's go into tonight's cage match boys and girls.
5672947	5673667	www.orangeloungeradio.com
5691388	5693570	Last week, we didn't have a cage match actually.
5693610	5699995	For the first time in about 100 episodes, we did not hold a cage match of any sort because we were too busy talking about E3.
5700115	5704499	So, by default, this song ended up getting a second week in rotation.
5705680	5706440	Imagine that.
5706540	5707381	So, we'll see.
5707421	5710804	Will it survive one more week and get closer to retirement?
5711605	5713346	On a personal note, I really hope not.
5713486	5714347	But we'll find out.
5715007	5717269	Darth Punk is song number one.
5717389	5719051	Ted Koppel's Gin and Juice.
5720182	5724263	You voted it in, here it is, a clip, because it did win last time.
5724703	5726863	And then you'll get to hear two new songs in their entirety.
5726883	5728363	Here it is, Ted Koppel, Gin & Juice.
5728604	5730684	Ain't leaving till six in the morning.
5731484	5732484	So what you wanna do?
5732704	5735885	Shit, I've got a pocket full of rubbers and my homeboys do too.
5736585	5743226	So turn off the lights and close the doors, but... Yeah, so we gon' smoke an ounce to this.
5743426	5746687	Jeez up, hose down while you motherfuckers bounce to this.
5750083	5754405	I'm Ted Koppel, and this is Laid Back.
5754745	5763749	Sources close to the White House today confirm that the president is laid back.
5766209	5770950	Now that I got me some Seagram's Gin, everybody got they cups, but they ain't chipped in.
5771411	5773611	Now this types of shit happens all the time.
5773651	5776112	You gotta get yours, but fool, I gotta get mine.
5776532	5779313	Everything is fine when you're listening to the T.E.D.
5779413	5782874	I got the cultivatin' music that be captivatin' he who listens.
5783354	5789257	To the words that I speak as I take me a drink to the middle of the street and get to mackin' this bitch named Katie.
5789277	5789837	Katie, correct?
5790017	5791698	She used to be the homeboy's lady.
5791818	5792378	Oh, that bitch?
5792818	5798461	Eighty degrees when I tell that bitch, please raise up off these NUTs cause you get none of these at ease.
5799581	5803303	As I mob with the dog pound field that breathes biatch, I'm just.
5805784	5810126	Earthquakes rocked Tokyo, Japan today as residents were laid back.
5815177	5820521	Residents in a small New England town are terrified as a mass murderer is laid back.
5820541	5824945	All right, that was a clip of song number one, Darth Punk, Ted Koppel's Gin and Juice.
5836210	5837771	Didn't that originate on something awful?
5839231	5840451	I'm getting a nod, yes.
5841191	5841592	Yes, it is.
5841692	5842572	Oh, that site's fun.
5842712	5846193	I hated putting that into the fortune cookie so many times.
5846473	5850214	That site is fun for the whole family.
5850614	5850914	It is.
5851154	5852414	Yeah, definitely.
5852434	5854915	They should be showing that website in Mormon churches everywhere.
5855455	5857115	All right, let's move on to song number two.
5857475	5859656	Song number two is my pick, my pick.
5861036	5863557	And I picked this song because it's a cover of ABBA.
5864560	5866061	and I can't get enough ABBA covers.
5866381	5867982	And this is actually from a new song.
5868022	5876465	I think it's supposed to showcase like unknown dance artists because it was called like Future Dance or something like that and I never heard of anybody on the CD.
5876826	5878186	And this mist was actually pretty good.
5878226	5878867	I kind of liked it.
5878907	5882488	It's a little different considering the original song is very slow.
5882548	5883529	I like what they did with this.
5884489	5889051	So this is DJ Tom Del Sar with The Winner Takes It All, 2005.
5889091	5889311	Enjoy.
5897567	5898828	Thanks for watching!
5979597	5983761	Thinking I'd be strong then But I wasn't true Playing Bible Groove
6022307	6030995	Like I used to kiss you Does it feel the same When she calls your name Somewhere deep inside You must know I miss you But what can I say Rules must be obeyed
6078025	6106290	I don't wanna talk If it makes you feel sad And I understand You've come to shake my hand I apologize If it makes you feel bad Seeing me so tense No self confidence But you see
6107786	6114367	The winner takes it all The winner takes it all The winner takes it all The winner takes it all
6161505	6163827	Alrighty, that's song number two in tonight's cage match.
6164227	6166929	DJ Tom Del Sar, the winner takes it all, 2005.
6167349	6172913	Did that song take it all, or are you gonna, uh, I don't know, take a crap on it?
6172953	6173553	I don't know, let's see.
6173713	6174414	DarkSakura!
6174454	6177616	That song was really good for me to take a big ol' shit on.
6177636	6179477	I mean, it wasn't too bad.
6179557	6180818	It's, again, trance.
6181418	6183760	A very generic trance mix of that.
6183920	6186462	And the original was so good, I guess, you know, I like ABBA.
6187222	6190364	But that gets a five, it was just mediocre.
6190805	6191305	Not exciting.
6192849	6196932	I could have sworn I've heard that song before, like, just as another transfer.
6197132	6199473	It's very similar to Erotic's version.
6199773	6203676	It's not, they do some different things with the vocals, but it's somewhat similar.
6204396	6205677	That just didn't do much.
6205917	6206758	It's just average.
6207198	6207878	It's a six.
6208739	6209139	Bradley.
6211100	6212221	Yeah, I'm set, Carter Fields.
6219638	6236582	I like it, it's ABBA, and since ABBA's a bunch of fuckers and they're never gonna reunite, that's the best thing we're gonna get, so, um, I like it, my only issue with it is I think it's a little bit long, which is kinda weird, because the original song was long, and that was fine, but this one was just a little too long for me, so...
6237182	6238023	I give it an 8.
6239184	6243687	Alright, let's go on to song number 3, DarkSakura, what did you pick for us tonight?
6243828	6246950	I've been wanting to put this song in the cage match for the past three months.
6248071	6252254	Finally, now that Demon Days has been released, I can legally put this song in the cage match.
6252815	6256258	So it's Gorillaz with Dare, which is actually going to be the next single.
6257559	6263223	Alright, here it is, a sneak peek at the next single from Gorillaz, and it's Jamie's cage match pick, Dare, song number 3.
6263463	6263684	Enjoy!
6265290	6283153	It's coming out, it's coming out, it's coming out, it's coming out, it's coming out, it's coming out, it's coming out.
6283253	6283793	It's there.
6283873	6288914	It's there.
6288974	6291655	You've got the pressure on you.
6291695	6292135	You just...
6512523	6515990	All right, song number three in tonight's cage match, Gorilla's Dare.
6516711	6518875	I dare you to tell me if you liked it or hated it.
6518915	6519597	DarkSakura.
6519797	6520138	Ten.
6521621	6522021	Of course.
6522041	6522482	Gorilla's.
6522683	6523143	Any reason?
6524289	6527591	Actually, this is one of the better tracks on the new CD.
6528091	6537635	It's definitely the most upbeat track on the whole CD, because most everything else is really dark, but this was really cool, and it was, uh, what's his name from the Happy Mondays?
6538576	6540977	One of the other collaborators on that track.
6542158	6542878	Pretty cool.
6543818	6544599	Alright, uh, Loki.
6547080	6548240	It was pretty funky.
6548260	6549141	I give it an 8.
6550982	6551302	That's it?
6551442	6551782	Funky?
6552122	6551782	8?
6552522	6552883	That's it.
6553043	6553503	Alright, Bradley.
6555410	6556692	I like the gorillas.
6556792	6562538	On one track it didn't really catch my attention very well.
6562939	6564401	I'll give it a 7 for now.
6567189	6567590	You know what?
6567610	6568690	I actually really like that song.
6568770	6575952	And if I think more of the Gorillaz music sounded like that, I'd probably be as much of a fan as Jamie is.
6576032	6580073	So I kind of wish they'd do more of that sound.
6580253	6584334	So I'm kind of excited that it's the next single because some of the remixes ought to be good.
6584434	6585854	So I will give that song...
6588275	6593237	At the same time, though, I'm starting to get a little burned out on gorillas and gorillas-related things in the cage match.
6593337	6595498	So I really hope... I've been waiting for three months to put that together.
6595578	6596018	I know.
6596218	6597379	And by the way, it was Shawn Ryder.
6597619	6601440	That's why I'm going to give it a bye, and I'm not going to dock at any point.
6601741	6602741	So I'm going to go ahead and give it a nine.
6603817	6609842	Alright, let's go ahead and recap, and then it'll be your turn to vote.
6610022	6612064	So here it is, the three songs you can vote for tonight.
6612124	6616608	Song number one, last week's winner, Darth Punk, Ted Koppel's Gin and Juice.
6617068	6620271	Today confirms that the president is laid back.
6623655	6626898	Song number two, DJ Tom Delsar, The Winner Takes It All, 2005.
6626958	6635207	And song number three you can vote for tonight is Gorilla's Dare.
6649961	6653442	All right, place vote now.
6653582	6660545	Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote for song number one, song number two, or song number three.
6660565	6664326	We'll tally them up and let you know who won.
6664446	6665707	So send that private message in now.
6666747	6667687	You don't have much time.
6668328	6669228	No dilly-dallying.
6671775	6672255	Yes, Loki.
6673056	6674837	I'd like to mention I did watch the video.
6676618	6686063	It's of a new song called Manhole, and that's like, you know, manhole in street, not as in, you know, something else.
6686923	6690685	Anyways, oh man, Food Mix 2 looks awesome.
6690825	6700230	The interface is really cool, and the videos are just about as good as they were last time, so definitely one to try out once it comes out.
6701192	6703593	But in the meantime, you'll just have to live vicariously through the video.
6703653	6706135	The weird thing about that video, on what website can they get the video on?
6706635	6728788	This is on, uh, it's http://foodmix.nothing.sh And there'll be a link on top there, it'll say, um... So that's foodmix.nothing.sh Yeah, that's shh, shh, shh, it.
6730839	6731419	Exactly.
6732320	6737584	And they basically have a 20 meg video you can download, plus five screen captures.
6738464	6747671	And you can check out the brand new song, which is pretty good, but I didn't get to listen to it when it was playing because we had other music going at the same time.
6748351	6750493	But it looks pretty cool.
6751274	6751894	And go check it out.
6753607	6760972	Now, what amazed me most about that video, the little bits that I saw kind of watching over your shoulder there, is that it appears that it has solo steps.
6761832	6762372	Well, yeah.
6762412	6765414	How many people actually take the time to create solo steps?
6767696	6769337	Oh, now you're playing it over there, huh?
6770357	6776381	Well, I'm playing the music, but it's got this, like, little pig bunny thing running around the background, and it looks pretty cool.
6777600	6779521	I really like the way Foon Mix is put together.
6779561	6782223	I think it is one of the superior mixes.
6782243	6787467	Of course, I haven't looked at a whole lot, but I think it is one of the better ones out there.
6790329	6792050	This is a weird song too.
6792070	6795152	Can you put the mic up to the speakers so they can hear a little bit of that?
6816671	6817151	Interesting.
6817892	6818552	A little funky.
6819072	6819953	What's the name of that song?
6821214	6821774	Manhole.
6822114	6823295	That's just bizarre.
6823315	6823755	Manhole.
6823896	6824916	And look, it's a manhole.
6825817	6829479	Yeah, there's a manhole, but what's great, though, is I'm going to fast forward it here into the end.
6830600	6831120	Tee hee.
6832041	6832681	Manhole.
6834262	6835503	But they have a really cool thing.
6836564	6838165	Like a little spinny flower thing, and then...
6841098	6843759	And then they have like, they're just the backgrounds and stuff.
6843779	6846239	They have a lot of animation going on the menus and stuff.
6846259	6847539	And that's what's pretty cool about it.
6848419	6849080	I think at least.
6851120	6851780	It looks pretty cool.
6852860	6854501	Anyways, so just go check it out.
6855801	6858941	Alrighty, last call for cage match votes.
6859202	6861582	Get those in right now or your vote won't count.
6862082	6865903	I don't think we talked about this a whole lot last week.
6865943	6866503	Pump it up.
6867438	6869500	The brand new thing coming out there.
6869600	6871001	Mad Catz is publishing it.
6871602	6876686	A whole shitload of songs is going to be in the new release of Pump It Up coming out here in the U.S.
6877047	6880510	Now, I know a lot of the DDR Freak people went and got to take a look at this.
6880530	6881991	Did you go to DarkSakura?
6882592	6882852	No.
6883232	6883352	Oh.
6884053	6885154	I don't care about Pump It Up.
6885354	6885494	Oh.
6886755	6889058	I would have gone just to check it out, but okay.
6890639	6892461	But what about Run To You?
6893932	6894933	It's not even in there.
6895333	6900075	What's the point anymore?
6900435	6905377	They've drained the lifeblood from Pump It Up in the form of Run To You.
6906258	6908299	I recommend that for the next break, by the way.
6908439	6910540	At least they have Beethoven's Virus.
6911560	6917203	Beethoven's Virus is a really... People whore the shit out of that song, but it's still really good.
6917363	6918243	It's kind of tough, too.
6918323	6919504	And they do have Funky Tonight.
6920307	6921027	So that's kind of cool.
6921127	6923028	Yeah, but no DJ Doc.
6923088	6924369	But this is what's really interesting.
6924709	6926890	They actually put K-pop in a U.S.
6926950	6927310	release.
6927370	6928271	I think that's kind of neat.
6928851	6930032	I don't know why, but I think that's neat.
6930972	6934034	But of course, then again, if you look at DDR, they do have some J-pop songs.
6934074	6937515	They don't bother translating, like, the B4U stuff, you know, which is kind of neat.
6937755	6940957	Need to put in, like, you know, some more M-flow.
6942758	6943458	You know, it's not K-pop.
6943538	6944439	Well, this is really weird.
6944519	6946099	And then they mix that with U.S.
6946119	6946179	pop.
6948047	6953211	Elvis, A Little Less Conversation Why does A Little Less Conversation have to be in every single music game?
6953291	6953611	I don't know.
6953892	6958655	Earth, Wind & Fire, Let's Groove, The Crystal Method, Name of the Game Okay, that's pretty awesome.
6960577	6962178	Sugarhill Gang, Rapper's Delight
6963146	6966249	I am glad that they have... That's actually pretty sweet right there.
6966309	6967770	And then a bunch of other songs I've never heard of.
6968371	6970973	They need to put Name of the Game in fucking DDR.
6971553	6973735	Make like a hardcore DDR mix.
6973795	6974936	Didn't they have Busy Child?
6974976	6977479	Or what song was in Max 2?
6977519	6978199	Was it Busy Child?
6978540	6979400	It was Busy Child.
6979480	6982123	But Name of the Game has, you know, the kick-ass...
6982543	6983384	Name of the game.
6983724	6985665	That song needs to be in Beatmania.
6985685	6989087	If you want to put licensed songs in Beatmania, that song right there.
6989107	6991028	Because it has tons of crazy scratching.
6991048	6992329	And it would be perfect.
6993270	6993730	Perfect.
6994550	6994831	Alright.
6995851	6997452	You kids want to hear who won tonight's Cage Match?
6997933	6998713	Yes, please.
6998793	6999494	Yes, let's.
6999754	7001195	Alright.
7001295	7005297	It was another one that came down to one freaking vote.
7006198	7010000	So if you think your votes don't count, you're full of crap.
7011513	7014139	Your votes count more than the US elections.
7016223	7019004	Your votes count more than any of ours, too, remember.
7019645	7025767	Because even though we rate the songs here, we go all Simon Cowell on them, they don't really count in the end.
7025867	7026807	It's your votes that count.
7027367	7033810	So the winning song by one vote... Oh, yes, I want to mention something real quick.
7033970	7041893	Since you mentioned Simon Cowell, a brand new American Idol type thing that's going to be going on, but dancing this time.
7043823	7044464	Oh, hooray!
7044524	7045344	I'm so excited.
7045384	7047706	Do you think any DDR players will be in on that?
7047987	7048227	Nope.
7048327	7048567	No.
7049107	7049428	Alright.
7049548	7059036	I just thought I'd mention it because, you know, one, it delays finding out who won, and two, it sort of had, you know, you know, a little bit of... Can I get to the cage much longer now?
7059136	7059396	I guess.
7062939	7063499	Gorillas.
7063880	7064160	Dare.
7068784	7069804	I love you, chat room.
7070205	7071565	One vote over the ABBA cover.
7071885	7072665	I love you, chat room.
7072905	7073586	Hey, good.
7073626	7076207	People had the good taste not to vote for Ted Koppel.
7076247	7077007	Yes, Ted Koppel.
7077167	7080688	And then on the other side of that, the Ted Koppel song got one vote.
7081308	7082109	I wonder who voted.
7083549	7086650	We need to find that person and beat them upside the head with a wet roll of newspaper.
7087730	7095613	They actually said in their vote, and I already closed the window so I forget who did it, but they actually said in their vote, I'm voting for it because nobody else is going to.
7096694	7097494	How prophetic.
7098843	7100824	We have ourselves a psychic in here.
7102726	7103066	All right.
7105167	7105448	Okay.
7108650	7109710	I am happy.
7109851	7118196	I am pleased as punch, to quote an old expression from the 50s, I am pleased as punch that gin and juice is out of there now.
7119617	7124501	and the heavens parted and the choir of angels came forth and said, woohoo!
7124561	7126823	Loki, don't you ever do that again.
7127523	7128144	Oh, don't worry.
7128384	7129325	It's coming back.
7129545	7130906	I'll stick the puppy dogs on you.
7131166	7134709	Oh, we'll make a remix of that in Girls or something, you know.
7134909	7135529	Oh, Christ.
7138112	7140155	No, anyways, speaking of remixes.
7141376	7142778	Let's go to a break, boys and girls.
7143119	7143880	Let's play my song!
7143960	7145822	Yeah, let's play, what song am I gonna play?
7145842	7148886	I was gonna do the dancing stage stuff, but we can do your song.
7148907	7150829	You can play the dancing stage stuff then, that's fine.
7150869	7154093	Alright, what song, oh, all of these on here that I haven't...
7155077	7155618	Okay, wow.
7155898	7157279	Okay, so we got this Blondie song.
7157359	7159280	Well, here, here, I'll pick some good ones out for you.
7159480	7159921	Okay, please do.
7160001	7163343	Okay, let's do... Is this the, oh, is this that song that I think it is?
7163624	7163964	It is.
7163984	7164484	Yes, I want that one.
7164524	7167026	Except there's no, not really many lyrics in that.
7167387	7169888	And then, um, Get It On.
7169908	7170529	Okay.
7170549	7171029	That'd be good.
7171950	7174132	And... So we're gonna play I See You Baby, Get It On.
7174332	7176594	And maybe, um, Some Girls Are Supergirl.
7176614	7177494	Yeah, that's supergirl.
7177534	7179676	And then we'll do four, so alright as well?
7180417	7182138	Um, oh, oh, oh, um, actually Circles.
7182918	7185879	Okay, so we're going to hear music, and what's the name of this game again?
7186199	7190060	Dancing Stage Unleashed 2, it's your European version of Ultramix 2.
7190520	7191820	Oh, very cool, very good.
7192481	7204424	Alright, here it is, started off with I See You Baby, and then we're going to get into Get It On, that sounds hot, Some Girls, and Circles, so this is the Europe version of Ultramix 2.
7204704	7208925	So let's see if it is yet another release over there that has better songs than us.
7209385	7209745	We'll see.
7209785	7210165	Probably.
7210345	7211066	We'll see, here we go.
7211406	7212186	We'll be back after this.
7213410	7214713	This is the house that Funk builds.
7215374	7216596	Group of Mata style.
7252621	7253982	Thank you for watching!
7291105	7292147	Oh, this party's got it going.
7292487	7292708	Oh!
7292848	7293188	And... Woo!
7293288	7293369	Oh!
7293429	7293649	What?

7666760	7675226	Gaming Radio, so uncensored that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.
7675426	7676767	Orange Lounge Radio.
7677427	7678048	Packed Guns.
7680205	7681325	We're back, boys and girls.
7682206	7682826	So what do you think?
7682866	7686948	Did the Brits get better on the Xbox second mix?
7687528	7688288	Sounds a lot better.
7689008	7689909	They got some fun stuff.
7690869	7691229	You know what?
7691529	7694310	I agree that they have some fun stuff, but I don't think they have it any better.
7694711	7696111	I just think it's the same.
7696251	7700773	I prefer that to... I'm not going to say it because I'm nice.
7703614	7703894	Loki?
7705155	7705575	I don't know.
7706797	7710760	I like some of their club music, but I don't like the Blondie.
7711200	7712761	Blondie can stay far away.
7713161	7714362	Blondie's cool.
7714502	7716903	Yeah, Blondie's cool in the 80s.
7717464	7718544	Blondie's not cool now.
7720285	7720886	I don't know.
7721846	7725789	Remember Maria from the late 90s when they reunited?
7726429	7727290	Maria!
7727370	7729231	That was a neat video.
7732434	7737236	I don't know, I actually do think the top of Blondie's popularity was about Rapture.
7738057	7739157	Rapture.
7742258	7744619	That's a little stupid rap about the aliens.
7745459	7751362	Do you know that Rapture was like the first rap song or whatever to top the billboard or something like that?
7751722	7753943	It like was a pop song that had rap in it.
7754043	7757844	I know, but they say it was the first rap song to ever top the charts.
7757984	7760205	I'm like, dude, when I think of rap,
7760575	7761516	I don't think a Debra Harry.
7763056	7764537	It's all about Grandmaster Flash.
7764697	7765598	I think a Tupac.
7767799	7768820	No, no, no, no.
7768860	7769960	You need to go older.
7771081	7775123	It's all about the message.
7776524	7779326	How about Flava Flav when he used to wear the huge clock around his neck?
7779966	7783148	I had some Public Enemy in the pre-show.
7783228	7783648	I know, I know.
7783768	7784749	I put 911 as a joke in there.
7784789	7785650	Flava Flav!
7787000	7791746	Then he started hanging out with Brigitte Nielsen, who wondered about the house naked.
7792347	7794389	That was my Flava Flav impersonation, by the way.
7794409	7795370	Flava Flav!
7796071	7799035	Okay, I'm going to go hide behind the chair now.
7799435	7801418	Come on, tell me that's not a good impression.
7802674	7803674	FLAVOR FLAVE!
7819269	7820530	What's the first two?
7820770	7821611	That's a good question.
7824054	7826676	In what sense that's used on web portals?
7826976	7831220	Ginormous was number one and Confuzzled was number two.
7831541	7832502	Me so Confuzzled.
7833122	7834543	Followed by Chillax.
7834644	7835865	What the hell did they scan?
7835885	7837386	I've never heard that one.
7837586	7839928	Chillax, which means chill out slash relax.
7840694	7841734	I'm going to go chillax.
7842134	7843195	Never heard it.
7843615	7845015	Cognitive dysplasia.
7845195	7846996	Where the hell did they get these words?
7847036	7849156	Did they scan people's live journals or something?
7849176	7850116	No, it was a contest.
7850136	7851337	DDR freak!
7853257	7860199	Cognitive dysplasia was the feeling that you have before you even leave the house that you're going to forget something about...
7860879	7861259	You're right.
7861299	7863440	That's a total DDR freak post.
7864100	7866141	Cosmic is actually a word.
7866401	7871062	Can someone explain for me why they won't put Japanese songs on American DDR?
7871082	7871862	I'm so confuzzled.
7872782	7873303	I don't know.
7873343	7874983	Then they have... OMG reads back.
7875103	7876864	Followed by number six is gription.
7877864	7879464	You know, my tires need gription.
7881025	7886767	Phonecrastinate means putting off answering the phone until it displays on caller ID.
7887487	7888047	Slickery.
7888647	7902230	Having a surface that is wet or icy, Snert, snow that is dirty, and Linguini, a person incapable of producing neoglyisms or something.
7902470	7902970	Alright, who cares?
7902990	7903531	Whatever the hell it is.
7903591	7904151	You know what?
7904391	7906231	That was stupid.
7907051	7908652	Skype line's open, boys and girls.
7908952	7910692	Call us, www.orangellinger.com.
7910712	7911613	Click on Interact With Us.
7913513	7917354	If you're really confuzzled at everything that's going on... You have cognitive dysplasia.
7918502	7921183	I like that, um, you know, those two words there.
7923605	7934390	And if you've ever tried to eat and snert, if you've ever tried to eat snirty, if you've ever tried to eat yellow snirty, we want to hear from you.
7936591	7937632	Snert's not a fucking word.
7937672	7938973	Who the hell comes up with this stuff?
7939313	7941914	I've never heard anyone use the word snert ever.
7942574	7942955	Ever.
7943975	7944495	Ever.
7944515	7946196	Alright, be quiet, we got a call.
7946236	7947297	Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.
7947816	7948136	Hey.
7948736	7949256	Hey, what's up?
7949276	7949636	Who's this?
7949877	7951197	It's BlackDevilRx.
7951317	7952357	Hello, BlackDevilRx.
7952377	7953037	What's on your mind?
7954338	7958259	Confuzzled should be stricken from the English language forever.
7959179	7961039	You know, I tend to agree.
7961059	7962640	Confuzzled is kind of a weird word.
7963340	7967161	I'm trying to think of other things I see in blogs way too much that ought to be banned.
7968201	7968561	Like what?
7969301	7969801	I don't know.
7969921	7975763	How about just... How about overusage of exclamation points?
7975903	7976243	I don't know.
7976283	7976383	Hmm.
7978322	7981303	How about LeetSpeak?
7981383	7982083	I want the number 3.
7982823	7984623	Just the number 3 to be banned.
7986484	7989684	We'll go around and break everybody's 3 keys so they can't type Leet.
7989784	7991464	They can't use LeetSpeak at all.
7991564	7992545	They'll just do 2 plus 1.
7995025	7996545	Anything on your mind gaming-wise?
7997786	7998326	No, not much.
7998806	8000586	I'm kind of waiting for UM3 to come out.
8001046	8002066	Oh yeah, Ultramix 3?
8002146	8003507	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
8003527	8005247	What did you think of the Midihead song we played earlier?
8005703	8006504	Oh, it was awesome.
8006624	8007586	I love Middyhead so much.
8007886	8009368	He's good stuff.
8009489	8010190	Good stuff.
8010410	8011031	Black Devil Rex.
8011531	8012453	Ooh, hi.
8013314	8013614	Hello.
8013735	8020084	So how can you tolerate the not staying on key, sounding like a gargled gravel?
8020104	8020144	Um...
8021966	8025427	Sorry, I don't know, it's probably this mic system I have, it's really old.
8025968	8027688	No, no, she's not talking about you.
8027908	8029949	I'm talking about me.
8030829	8031069	Okay.
8031590	8032730	Kind of misunderstood there.
8032790	8037412	I realize DarkSakura can be pretty blunt with people, but she does have tact.
8038512	8039833	Your voice sounds like crap.
8040673	8042014	No, I'm not that bad.
8044582	8044963	I don't know.
8045803	8046905	I'm gonna be nice.
8047105	8048466	She's making fun of Midi Head.
8048827	8049127	Nice.
8049427	8051910	I'm not making fun of him, I just don't think he can sing very well.
8053049	8054269	He should get somebody who can sing.
8054289	8057450	Well, he sold records and CDs, and he makes money.
8057470	8059230	It's always Paul and Terry, but what's her excuse?
8059710	8061711	You gotta go out and buy a MIDI head CD.
8061731	8066791	You know, people still buy, you know, crap like Britney Spears, and she can't sing either.
8067031	8067692	Touché.
8068012	8071832	Oh, worse than that, people watch that freaking show on UPN.
8072332	8074713	What is it, Britney and... No, no, no, wait, wait, wait, stop, stop, what?
8074773	8075893	Nobody watches UPN.
8077193	8077413	Ever.
8077473	8078233	Wrestling's on?
8078253	8079033	Uh-uh, uh-uh.
8079314	8081634	I watch Girlfriends every Monday night, okay?
8083246	8084067	I'm just kidding, I don't.
8084747	8085768	But I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
8085788	8087409	Oh my god, I just watched the WB.
8087429	8089671	Oh god.
8090892	8094134	Excuse me, weren't you a Buffy fan, if I recall?
8094594	8098357	I like Buffy, and I only watched UPN because Buffy went to UPN.
8098917	8099898	I don't like Angel.
8102100	8102820	I don't like Angel.
8102940	8103781	Angel's a whiny bitch.
8105142	8107884	Anyway, before we got there on TV chat, what was that?
8107944	8109125	Oh yeah, the Britney thing.
8109225	8110866	Apparently on this show, what?
8112489	8112849	Nothing?
8113330	8114511	I thought we were talking about MidiHead.
8114931	8116052	I'm just laughing at what she said.
8116612	8118814	How did we get from MidiHead to UPN?
8119174	8121116	Hold on, I'm not done talking about Britney Spears yet.
8121496	8126560	Britney Spears, apparently on her show, reveals herself to be a total nymphomaniac.
8126841	8128482	Like she always talks about sex.
8128802	8130824	That would be hot if she wasn't pregnant.
8133487	8137889	But since she's pregnant and fat and nasty... And she's smoking too, right?
8138330	8139390	She's a fucking baby killer.
8139410	8142592	And that would also be original if Madonna hadn't done it 15 years ago.
8142612	8144173	You can't have a baby genius.
8144373	8147915	The baby needs to grow up to be a pop star, so she has to smoke at an early age.
8147935	8149396	Well, her little sister's giving it a go.
8150056	8152017	I have a friend who went to high school with Britney Spears.
8152697	8153218	In New Orleans.
8153458	8153858	I'm sorry.
8154278	8154658	So was he.
8156239	8156619	Anyway.
8157460	8158641	Hi, Black Devil Rex.
8158661	8160181	You called to talk about games?
8160281	8160982	Still here.
8162441	8164824	This is what we do to our callers, don't worry about it.
8171093	8176781	Yeah, so hopefully no Britney on Ultramix 3, although the Extreme 2 kids are getting some Britney, but it's going to be covered.
8177302	8177963	Huh?
8178564	8179345	People got angry.
8180346	8181087	Oh my god!
8181448	8182469	Oops, I did it again!
8199842	8200302	and Ninja Rep.
8227970	8228651	Yeah, Ninja Rap.
8228971	8229452	It's up there.
8230353	8232135	It's up there in the big pile of suck.
8232356	8234158	Go Ninja, Go Ninja, Go.
8234538	8237762	Oh, and you know what rhymes with Go Ninja, Go Ninja, Go?
8238243	8240125	Konami, Konami, Yo.
8241728	8243109	I know, that's what I was thinking.
8243129	8247711	I swear to God, at E3, the announcer guy would be, Konami, Konami, yo!
8247991	8252394	And then they'd all of us going, I was just moving my mouth going, this sucks, this sucks, yo.
8253134	8256056	And I was thinking, go ninja, go ninja, go!
8256116	8258177	I just said, ninja, ninja rap.
8265475	8267636	Thank you for depressing us, BlackDevilRx, with your phone call.
8267656	8268256	You're welcome.
8268456	8269576	You are so welcome.
8270637	8272957	We like some distraction here.
8273258	8274958	You're getting us in the mood for the goth club.
8275158	8279860	Digression is our middle, no, lounge is our middle name.
8280080	8285001	I'm going to wear all black, and I'm going to listen to depressing music.
8285201	8289263	I'm Osriel, the Prince of Sorrow.
8289283	8293044	Okay, the joke is about an hour and a half ago.
8294204	8295505	Goth Talk still cracks me up.
8296325	8298286	I'm on joke Hawaiian time.
8298326	8299547	Hey, our caller's trying to speak.
8299587	8300067	Let him speak.
8300527	8301348	No, no, no, no, no.
8301388	8302188	I'm just, no.
8302608	8303048	I'm finished.
8303869	8304729	You don't want to speak?
8305069	8306610	Well, you could sing or something.
8306630	8307110	I don't know.
8308451	8308711	Sing.
8308831	8309652	Serenade us!
8310912	8311492	I command.
8311512	8312853	He's making fun of goth people.
8313914	8315134	I can't hear him.
8315254	8316575	He's saying keep making fun of goth people.
8316595	8317675	Yeah, you're getting quiet all of a sudden.
8317695	8319296	We're not making fun of goth people.
8319316	8321417	We're making fun of people who make fun of goth people.
8322238	8322578	Like you.
8324460	8325661	Wow, that was nice.
8326281	8326542	Hi.
8327122	8327542	All right.
8327862	8330124	We're going to let you go before DarkSakura says something really mean.
8330144	8332145	Honestly, we're not having an Asian drink.
8332746	8333366	I'm not being mean.
8333386	8334007	Am I being mean?
8334687	8334867	No.
8335388	8335648	See?
8336188	8336529	All right.
8336589	8337429	You got served.
8340151	8342313	Wow, that joke was like a couple years ago.
8342913	8343754	I know it was great.
8344294	8346015	All right, BlackDevilRx, you're bringing the show down.
8346055	8346596	I need to let you go.
8347156	8347736	Okay, fine.
8347897	8348337	No, I'm kidding.
8348357	8349998	What do you want to say?
8351459	8353000	Go beat Mania U.S.
8355071	8355891	Yeah, I agree.
8355951	8357532	Go Beatmania US.
8358652	8361893	Go right on the store shelves and into my house as soon as possible.
8363673	8364433	Shut up, Jamie.
8365374	8365754	Alright.
8369395	8370695	Have a good one, BlackDevilRx.
8370715	8371575	We'll talk to you later, alright?
8371595	8372115	Alright, I will.
8372275	8372535	Later.
8372856	8373116	Bye.
8373156	8373376	Bye.
8375916	8382098	I bet it's got to be really amusing to be somebody calling into this show and just really not knowing what you're in for when you come and speak to us.
8387316	8388177	Let's go to another call.
8388297	8391559	This is like one of those times that we need a random call from, like, Travis.
8391599	8392259	Hold on, hold on.
8392719	8393680	Travis, call us!
8393800	8395621	Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle Fan Club, you're on the air.
8396901	8398062	Hey, Sky, Siggy here.
8398222	8398762	Hey, what's up?
8400103	8400863	Go, Siggy!
8400883	8401624	Go, Siggy!
8401684	8401964	Go!
8401984	8403825	Oh, I'll need to stop that!
8405866	8407287	We don't have to!
8408522	8411624	I'm getting sick and tired of hearing that ninja rap already.
8411964	8414125	It's been over... Come here and make us!
8414245	8414766	Damn!
8416707	8417467	Oh, what a good start.
8417547	8420369	I like it when the callers berate us once in a while.
8421069	8425012	Yeah, they better be ready to receive as good as they give.
8427073	8428674	Alright, Siggy, what's on your mind?
8429314	8434137	Well, the money-wise, I finally... Who cares about the money?
8434157	8435438	I'm sorry.
8436331	8440633	I finally AAA'd the most common another, which is Commento di Adieu.
8440653	8442674	Ah, okay, good.
8443474	8448997	Yeah, and I've beaten some anothers as well, like Stoic and Murmurtwins.
8449257	8451498	Now, Stoic is some scary shit on another.
8452118	8453099	You're telling me.
8454540	8455240	Well, good for you.
8455281	8458603	So now your 2DX penis has just grown by about three centimeters.
8458643	8459503	So congratulations.
8459603	8460204	Go hump something.
8461565	8461905	Thank you.
8462965	8469369	And non-Bimani-wise, I'm planning to enter this Friday's World Series of Poker No Limit Hold'em Tournament.
8470070	8470410	Really?
8471151	8472692	Yeah.
8473832	8475053	Well, you live in Vegas, right?
8475573	8475794	Yeah.
8475934	8477915	So that's going to be very interesting being there.
8478075	8479556	They got a prize or something?
8480991	8483772	I think the top price is $350,000.
8483812	8484072	Shit!
8484112	8494314	That's just only for the minor No Limit Hold'em tournament, but the main event is going to be about $5 million.
8495894	8496215	Wow.
8497255	8498555	$5 million for poker?
8499055	8499935	I'm in the wrong job.
8500375	8501116	I can play poker.
8501896	8503496	Not that good.
8504156	8505196	I can play strip poker.
8505237	8506497	I play strip poker for free.
8508123	8513145	Well, strip poker is based on five-card... Draw?
8513686	8514406	Yeah, five-card draw.
8514506	8516547	And the tournament's Texas Hold'em?
8516747	8517167	Or what is it?
8517527	8518508	Texas Hold'em, no limit.
8518708	8521749	Yeah, see, Texas Hold'em's like the big game right now because of all the TV shows.
8521789	8523450	No one likes playing strip poker with me because I win.
8525311	8525831	All the time.
8525851	8528092	I, you know, beat them in poker and they're naked.
8528592	8531213	Fucking women, you know, they don't want to play strip poker correctly.
8531333	8533594	I mean, they just like... I agree.
8533674	8534295	Fucking women.
8536617	8537377	I was just waiting for that.
8537397	8539978	Well they freaking take off their clothes and they put a towel on.
8540158	8541158	You can't do that.
8541858	8543379	That's not the point of the game.
8544759	8550441	Oh damn, speaking of strip poker, it's been over a decade since I've played strip poker on a computer.
8552341	8555782	Oh my gosh, remember the old strip poker games on Apple II?
8557701	8559222	Oh and Illusion, screw you!
8559242	8560162	What did he say now?
8585424	8588826	Yeah, tune in to see me lose on Series of Poker?
8588846	8589667	Well, screw you!
8591348	8593409	Well, you win that money, just to show him.
8593690	8596131	And then you buy him something ugly.
8598373	8599293	Like Britney Spears.
8599454	8606258	Now, if you are able to buy this, or I'm sorry, if you're able to win this tournament, you will buy us a studio, right?
8607659	8608120	I don't know.
8608560	8609981	I haven't thought about it.
8610041	8614424	Well, first thing in mind is I might move to a new house.
8615194	8616615	Well, I suppose that's got to be done too.
8616655	8618876	I'm thinking I need to become friends with Michael Jackson.
8619596	8620297	Ah, no way.
8620317	8621798	You're not old, or you're too old.
8623138	8623579	Why?
8623839	8624919	I can understand him.
8628041	8628982	I'm not even going to go there.
8631623	8633064	Alright, anything else on your mind, Siggy?
8633632	8642194	Well, nothing much else, but yeah, I really wanted... Hey, the song I gave you earlier, you should play that.
8642654	8643334	I'll think about it.
8643794	8644294	I'll think about it.
8644314	8644794	That's a good point.
8644874	8645775	Play my song.
8646235	8647375	Oh yeah, I gotta play Loki's song.
8647395	8649555	I don't know if I'm gonna have time, because I promised Loki I'd play it.
8649695	8653576	Oh yeah, if you have some room, play Virocana.
8653636	8655337	We'll see if we can squeeze it in somewhere.
8655977	8656197	Yeah.
8656597	8656877	Alright.
8657997	8659137	Alright, we're gonna let you go now.
8659558	8659818	Alright.
8659978	8660438	Alright, later.
8660998	8661458	Later.
8662003	8664425	Alright, let's see if we have time for one more call.
8664525	8670729	In the meantime, this clip here is supposed to have, I think, a clip of Genie in a Bottle in it?
8670809	8671169	I don't know.
8671289	8673911	Somebody had posted this over on The Freak, so now I'm all curious.
8674231	8677593	Because I think this has a clip of the Genie in a Bottle mix that's on DDR Extreme.
8678114	8683858	And if not, it'll be movie time, and a good chance for us to make fun of some... E3 Cam!
8683938	8685018	It's the Fan Cam!
8685078	8685859	Fan Cam!
8686219	8686880	Oh, it's...
8689580	8690581	I'm sorry, Jamie, I'm trying.
8690601	8691702	Why does he have a helmet on?
8691722	8692743	Oh, that's right, that's that guy I saw.
8692763	8694424	Oh, you can hear the genie in a bottle thing.
8694444	8694584	Uh-oh.
8694624	8695345	Oh, shit, I broke it.
8695445	8695605	Okay.
8714823	8716004	Uh, no, yeah, let's skip it.
8716064	8719566	The tutorial's being skipped, and then they get, okay, here's the genie in a bottle, if you want to hear what this sounds like.
8720126	8720747	Alright, guys.
8724409	8726470	Joel the fan cam does DDR.
8731012	8731973	I can't hear this for shit.
8740045	8742227	No, I'm turning this off because you can't hear it for crap.
8742627	8745889	If you want to check this out, though, it's on E3insider.com.
8745909	8747110	Just do a search for DDR.
8747170	8750012	And if you turn up your speakers really, really loud, you can hear it.
8750052	8752053	And you can hear what the new Genie in a Bottle and DDR sounds like.
8752493	8754695	And supposedly, it's actually surprisingly good.
8754715	8760298	Honestly, folks, if you want to know what Genie in a Bottle sounds like, just imagine a Dance Mania cover.
8760438	8761739	That's what it is, basically.
8762740	8763120	Pretty much.
8764657	8764938	All right.
8767300	8769923	We're going to get into the FUs of the week very shortly here.
8770683	8771945	I don't see anybody else calling in.
8772005	8775628	So we will do Loki's song and then we're going to do the FUs of the week.
8775648	8780233	So start sending in the FUs of the week right now and we'll get to that.
8781314	8783076	But Loki, what are we playing here from you?
8783456	8785277	Well, this is right here, like I said before.
8785377	8787979	It's not really a remix.
8788039	8792362	It's just kind of, I extended the song a bit, and I added some samples on top of it.
8792842	8802569	I thought about remixing it, but then I figured out that the song, the portions I have of the song, because it's only a minute long, really, the original, I didn't have enough to work with to make something.
8802689	8805951	So, this is whatever crap it is.
8806051	8808653	And I don't know what the actual title of the song is, so I called it Acid.
8808753	8808853	It's
8809448	8814171	Basically, the theme that they had playing in the trailer for Metal Gear Acid 2, and it was fucking awesome.
8814251	8817452	Every time I heard the song at the Kanai booth, I'm like, I gotta get this song.
8817592	8818533	I gotta get this song.
8818593	8819513	I gotta get this song.
8819593	8820914	So, I found it.
8821695	8822695	I sort of extended it.
8823075	8823756	It's pretty cool.
8824436	8824616	Enjoy.
8845645	8846333	Metal Gear
8887619	8888188	Metal Gear
8928410	8929230	That was wonderful.
8930971	8932391	We're back on Orange Launch Radio, by the way.
8932691	8932972	Loki.
8934072	8935352	So anything else you want to say about that mix?
8935672	8936413	No, not really.
8936853	8937413	It's just awesome.
8937753	8939894	I just needed to make a version of it that could play in my car.
8940114	8940594	That's about it.
8941835	8942215	Who knows?
8942295	8944555	I might work on that later, maybe to add something.
8944876	8953879	I am, however, going to work on something because there's another song that I liked in another trailer, and I found the trailer today for Coated Arms that's going to be a remix of Trip Machine eventually.
8953979	8957300	But this is just something for now.
8957560	8958020	It's just fun.
8959807	8960928	This is because I like that song.
8960948	8965812	Well, yep, I picked different music again this week because I just cannot decide.
8990509	8992970	Big SU goes to bloating.
8994551	8995932	I'm not going to say anything more about that.
8996993	9000114	An SU goes to my car being completely undriveable now.
9000254	9004117	My fiancé, bless him, tried to hammer the fender back into place.
9005497	9008919	Well, I can drive it if I want to go left all the time.
9009720	9011100	Yeah, it's undriveable.
9011601	9012041	Unsafe.
9013162	9013522	Sigh.
9015413	9030609	Um, also, um, you know, she was a nice lady, has always done a great job doing my haircut, but my hair got cut way too short, and then I, you know, my scalp is still red from dyeing it, so, big F you to that, too.
9030629	9030669	Um...
9034131	9037294	F you to my nerves and F you to me putting off stuff that needs to get done.
9037515	9042480	And that's really... Oh yeah, and a big ol' F you to my work for changing all of my damn job duties.
9042740	9043741	Whoa, it's an E3!
9044081	9045943	Yeah, big fuck off to that.
9045963	9046824	Okay, I'm done.
9049066	9049427	Loki.
9052104	9064333	First off, fuck you to everybody that's not on Final Fantasy XI because, you know, it's very quiet when I come online to play, you know, late at night and there's just me.
9064913	9066154	I can't really talk to myself.
9066294	9066935	It's not fun.
9067535	9069657	And everyone else is Japanese and that doesn't work.
9070677	9071478	So that sucks.
9072539	9073179	You'll get over it.
9073780	9074560	Or you'll quit too.
9075061	9075921	I'm not quitting.
9076001	9078763	I have dedicated too much time to my character.
9078783	9081185	I will stay on until that game stops working.
9082461	9086124	or I become level 75 in every single job and have finished every single bit of that game.
9086705	9087806	And then I'll sell my character.
9089287	9090368	And make some mad cash.
9090748	9101117	Anyways, um, then, uh, also, just, basically, you know, fuck you to Robot Chicken for sucking the last few weeks, and fuck you to the fact that I missed Family Guy tonight.
9102678	9103339	Oh, it's not on?
9103879	9104140	Oh, well.
9104600	9105221	Never mind, then.
9106342	9108964	Family Guy is not on tonight, so listen to Orange on Radio.
9111059	9111219	Anyway.
9111239	9113620	And if you heard that, you already are listening to Orntown Radio.
9113880	9117321	And also, um, fuck you to Arnold Schwarzenegger, because he can act.
9118121	9122263	And, um, he can't really govern either, so I don't really know what his talent is yet.
9122603	9123543	He can lift weights!
9124183	9125384	He should be a weightlifter.
9125804	9126204	The end.
9126744	9133327	Um, and also, um, fuck you to everyone that's seen this new commercial with, um, Paris Hilton is too scantily clad.
9133607	9133947	Honestly...
9134927	9138670	Whatever, it's just blatant, you know, sex sells, you know, burger commercial.
9139190	9140752	I don't see anything wrong with that, to be honest.
9141052	9143394	Hell, if she's gonna be a whore, let her be a whore on TV.
9143414	9146036	At least she's, you know, scantily clad and stuff and showing off her body.
9146856	9150019	Big deal, you know, honestly, because that's her only talent.
9150179	9153642	So, just let her, you know, let her work her talent.
9154349	9158170	You know, eventually she's gonna do mainstream porn and that'll be, uh, happy.
9158810	9167552	And, um, finally, um, I'd like to mention, um, a fuck you to, uh, Patrick Swayze for being just all weird.
9167992	9173673	Because he's coming to our work next week and signing autographs, so I'm actually gonna get an autograph of his for some reason.
9174293	9183515	And, um, but he doesn't want anyone to, he doesn't want to sign anything that has to do with older projects he's worked on, i.e., like, you know, um,
9184187	9187349	Dirty Dancin' or something like that, and he doesn't want you to touch him in any way.
9188490	9190731	Aw, so you can't give Patrick Swayze a hug?
9191512	9192472	Or shake his hand or anything?
9192512	9193113	He's like, AH!
9193753	9195034	You know, just like, but anyways.
9195414	9197115	Yeah, Patrick Swayze's coming to my work.
9197575	9198296	That's awesome.
9198996	9200917	But, you know, I just don't really care either.
9201158	9209583	I'm hoping, the best person that came to our work, actually the two best people, Pauly Shore and, um, oh god, Rob Schneider.
9210403	9210904	My favorites.
9211684	9212264	Alright, I'm done.
9212344	9213165	I don't really have anything.
9221195	9225679	and F you to me feeling selfish because I'm not getting what I want and that makes me very sad.
9227980	9232584	And just F you to general blahness that I've kind of been dealing with the past few days.
9233485	9236487	And F you to feeling an utter lack of something.
9237408	9241571	And not being sure there's a lot that you can do about it.
9243232	9245794	But yeah, I guess that's it.
9246335	9247155	Was that cryptic enough?
9247215	9247516	I don't know.
9247756	9248616	Alright, let's move on.
9248676	9248997	Bradley.
9252226	9258891	Fuck you to my computer being old and my power supply burning out and causing all this computer drama.
9259431	9267917	Hopefully I can sort of push money around somewhere to, or at least to build a skeleton computer or something new.
9269298	9271059	I'm hopefully going to do that soon.
9272139	9272760	That's about all.
9274861	9277803	Alright, let's go on to the chatroom FUs.
9277983	9279004	Dynamite Rage!
9283188	9285649	Chimera wants to give an FU to GOTS.
9287369	9290610	Just remember, if you make fun of GOTS, you still play DDR.
9290910	9291710	I would be Chimera.
9292951	9293791	Close Chimera.
9293831	9294671	Close Chimera.
9295811	9298272	The CH is a hard K sound.
9299572	9299892	Whatever.
9300613	9304154	Laser123454321 says, FU to Copyright Enforcement.
9305834	9307874	Yeah, that sucks when you want to steal someone else's work.
9308335	9309655	And FU to New Orleans.
9310451	9312853	Yeah, fuck it, MPAA is shutting down some foreign sites.
9313714	9314134	Bitches.
9314534	9316696	Especially the TV ones, like, you get new shows.
9317557	9323281	MPQ says, F you to myself for forgetting last week that forum drama is retarded.
9324963	9326464	Aw, I want more details on that one.
9328185	9332789	Dark Knight says, F you to working this weekend, including Monday and missing out on the cookouts.
9336815	9343058	Ninst says, F you to half the people I went to Anime North with as they forgot about Mimos of Saturday.
9343819	9354645	F you to the MyBank, I think that meant say, Ninst says F you to MyBank, as I was unable to draw money for my account this weekend from ATMs and I can't find out why till Tuesday.
9360248	9364290	DarkTetsuya says, F you to Trip Machine, Survivor, Light.
9364790	9366151	I can't seem to get it triple A'd.
9370678	9393533	OMG It's Doobz says F you to finals for being so damn hard to study for F you to DDR players that live in Ohio for being so friggin good and last F you to you Sky for being sarcastic on my Skype call don't hate on me and my four centimeter penis I think he meant plus four centimeter penis but isn't it funnier when I say four centimeter penis
9395393	9401535	You know, that's funny, it's like, you know, like Final Fantasy, penis plus one, you know, penis plus four centimeters.
9404516	9409578	Oh, and F you to Florida, because I have to move this summer, and I don't know anyone who plays DDR at North.
9412950	9416114	BlackDevilerX says F you to my mic system for being jacked up.
9416174	9417475	I keep hearing myself echo.
9418056	9419478	F you to finals in two weeks.
9420018	9423643	F you to DarkSakura for taking my god-given voice away.
9423743	9424363	No, just kidding.
9424423	9424944	I was being mean.
9425785	9427687	F you to missing the first 15 minutes of the show.
9428188	9431432	F you in general that I haven't been able to listen to the show in so long.
9436385	9443668	and Illusion says, F you to having to fix all the bugs and not knowing how to have an exit function in my new game, Oblivion.
9444448	9452231	F you to having to censor Dammit Janet at karaoke last night saying, Janet, Janet, I love you, instead of the real lyric, Dammit Janet, I love you.
9453152	9455533	They should have censored it to fucking Janet.
9456173	9457233	Fuck off, bitch!
9458054	9460875	Oh well, we still get to do Rock Your Picture Show music, and that's the last one.
9461055	9461495	That's good.
9462950	9469053	Alright, yeah, I agree that what you should do, Illusion, is your very last night at karaoke at that place.
9469273	9488544	First off, stop going to a family-friendly establishment for karaoke, but I understand you're probably not old enough to get into a bar yet, so you can keep doing that for now, but then when you're old enough to get to a bar, do your last hurrah at karaoke, and when you've got the mic in your hand, on the very last Dammit Janet, go, fuck off, bitch, I wanna screw, and then just walk out before they throw you out.
9489637	9489917	Run.
9490417	9491158	What are they going to do?
9491258	9492338	Turn the mics off on you?
9492438	9492859	Oh, no.
9493039	9494720	Ow, my freaking ears.
9497101	9498561	My ears are bleeding.
9498581	9501903	I heard naughty words, and I'm going to go to hell for it.
9502784	9506005	I want to have sex with prostitutes now, Mommy.
9512028	9513289	Because I saw it on TV.
9513919	9521463	That's the nice thing about karaoke, where I go to karaoke, is that you can replace the lyrics with, fuck off, bitch, I wanna screw, and then they laugh.
9522304	9527026	I was remembering the touch-a-touch-a line, that was funny.
9527266	9528507	Oh, fuck-a-fuck-a-fuck me?
9528827	9532870	No, you went up there and... Oh, yeah, who was singing it, Jessica?
9532890	9533330	Jessica was.
9533430	9538733	Yeah, Jessica, a guana girl was up on stage singing touch-a-touch-a-touch me, so I walked up on stage and grabbed her boobs.
9543547	9544588	That cracks me up.
9549632	9550453	Anyways, oh yeah.
9550573	9552815	Did we mention that we sometimes use foul language on this show?
9553456	9555437	This is your program because I need language.
9557760	9558840	We gave the disclaimer.
9559321	9561823	If people are offended by it, you heard the disclaimer.
9562003	9562564	Fuck off.
9562784	9563244	Yeah.
9566047	9566387	Alright.
9567688	9569110	We're going to do another quickie break here.
9569470	9570631	I love internet radio!
9571581	9575624	Just an uber quick break here, and then we're going to come back with Ask Orange Lounge.
9575664	9579607	So you guys have a few minutes to get in your questions for Ask Orange Lounge.
9579647	9581548	You can ask us anything you want, within reason.
9582829	9585631	And send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your question.
9585671	9588794	It's your chance to direct the show the way you want.
9589634	9593537	We'll be back after this, featuring some music from DDR Solo.
9594558	9597460	Because I kind of want to strut my funky stuff right about now.
9598020	9598961	So we'll be back after this.
9601715	9602370	Come on, come on!
9706454	9707596	Thanks for watching!
9778032	9780055	Love and Peace is our fight.
9807592	9808817	I will follow only you
9867360	9876711	And now, let's listen in to an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting as they debate some of the new programming coming to Orange Lounge Radio.
9877459	9881540	Jamie, I have a suggestion about some of the music in our Bomani Music and More program.
9881560	9882521	Can we talk about that?
9882801	9885141	No subject will ever be taboo.
9885442	9889063	Well, I was thinking maybe we should move Pump Up the Volume from Tuesday Nights.
9889603	9892144	Except, of course, a subject that was just under discussion.
9892644	9897985	Okay, well, what would you think if maybe we cut back on some of the tack music we play on the station?
9898546	9899826	I collect your fucking head.
9901801	9903302	Just like this fucker here.
9904383	9908067	Oh my god, why did you do that to Loki?
9908367	9911730	The holic thing on episode 69 was just a joke!
9912671	9919117	Now if any of you sons of bitches got anything else to say, now's the fucking time!
9920338	9924061	Orange Lounge Radio, where everybody has a say.
9929560	9931381	We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
9931441	9933962	Loki's saying nobody gets the Episode 69 thing anymore.
9934262	9934983	You're probably right.
9935843	9937784	I wasn't even here for Episode 69.
9940606	9943927	Which, in a way, kind of makes it funnier when you consider all the holic thing, you know?
9944167	9946769	But, anyway.
9946829	9949430	We actually have quite a few questions tonight for Ask Orange Lounge.
9949470	9953612	Usually I'm having to beg and plead for questions, but people just want to know shit tonight, so this is good.
9954513	9955053	Let's get to it. ...
9961570	9964532	Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.
9965012	9968234	What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?
9968654	9973737	We've got a lot of questions and only 10 minutes left of show, so we better hurry through.
9973757	9975658	These questions are somewhere getting left in the dust.
9981882	9982282	Illusion.
9983898	9990026	Question for Loki, you often do remixes of Babani songs, but do you do any original songs?
9990687	9992369	And if you do, would you ever release a CD?
9993624	9997566	Um, I do original songs, but it's been a looong time.
9998626	10000527	We've played some of them on the station before.
10000547	10002547	It was a long time ago when you did original stuff.
10002647	10003468	Why'd you stop?
10003808	10008389	It's just, I was using old programs like EJ and stuff, and I- Lazy.
10008990	10015712	No, not lazy, it's just the sound samples I didn't really want to work with, and I tried to upgrade programs and stuff to something that would be more fun to work with.
10016613	10018473	I don't know, I- I don't know.
10018813	10019113	We'll see.
10020014	10020274	Maybe.
10021636	10028538	Well, now, you did put together a compilation CD, but you only did like two or three copies of the CD, right?
10028578	10030739	Well, yeah, because I have all the files.
10030799	10035180	Originally, it was going to be one of those create-your-own-CD-type situations on like a website.
10035540	10038681	Of course, web hosting, you know, it's not too reliable, so, yeah.
10040345	10041386	Yeah, I hate that.
10041506	10044107	I just can't find any websites with unlimited bandwidth or anything.
10044768	10046629	Alright, let's move on.
10046669	10049951	Jin4576 says, Namco Cross Capcom came out in Japan recently.
10050291	10052052	Do you think that it will come out here in the US?
10052592	10053013	Of course.
10053173	10053813	My answer is yes.
10054073	10055154	Yes, it definitely will come out here.
10055194	10056455	In fact, I think it's already been announced.
10057015	10058856	They just didn't show it at E3 for whatever reason.
10059617	10061958	So, I expect you'll probably see it, what, Christmas time?
10061978	10062639	What do you think?
10062859	10063159	Probably.
10063179	10063699	Does that sound good?
10064280	10065080	Yeah, I like that idea.
10066401	10067041	It'll come out here.
10067862	10069903	I think that's too big a game to not come out here.
10071388	10077731	Laser123454321 wants to know, what would be a good licensed song for Beatmania USA?
10080612	10082392	Well, like I said before, name of the game.
10083193	10083773	That'd be good.
10085253	10095918	There's a lot of stuff that would lend itself pretty well to... You can even do, like, if you want to really get obscure, you can do the Beck remixes with the 8-bit remixes for his stuff.
10096178	10097898	Oh, the Ghetto Chip Malfunction and stuff like that?
10097918	10099059	You can get some of that in there.
10101499	10103260	Thanks for watching!
10118064	10118504	Exactly!
10118705	10119925	Oh my god, MIDI head stuff.
10120005	10122287	I mean, that's, I think, where they should go.
10122427	10123088	And ToeJam.
10123188	10124489	I bet ToeJam's gonna be in there.
10124529	10133315	Just because it's, you know, a different drum song, and it was in, you know, the 2DX... Technically, Big Idea is in a different drum.
10133435	10134656	But I know what you're saying.
10135216	10136878	It was a US song, and now it's in Happy Sky.
10137138	10137318	Yeah.
10137438	10137938	Yeah, who knows.
10138779	10139219	That'd be neat.
10140060	10144023	I, personally, I really want Echo Image Skulk.
10144723	10145964	Or at least some Echo Image song.
10146384	10146805	That'd be cool.
10147506	10157192	Kymera, since I got criticized for my pronunciation, wants to know, Yo, do you think it would be ethical to cheat friends of their souls, like in a game of high stakes poker?
10157873	10158413	Absolutely not.
10158453	10160835	If they're stupid enough to bet it, then they're stupid enough to lose it.
10160875	10164517	Like if you're going to sell your soul for a donut, I mean... Or sell your soul for $5.
10164617	10165398	Or sell it on eBay.
10165418	10166759	That would be a fucking good donut.
10168143	10169985	Also, shouldn't Maddox get his own forums?
10185821	10187862	I hate Cameron Diaz I hate Cameron Diaz too
10210448	10212849	It's because of that stupid MTV show that she does now.
10213469	10214830	An MTV show?
10215630	10216070	Yeah.
10216550	10219971	She goes to all the parts of the world that are poor.
10220291	10223873	Like, you know, Africa and the Amazon and blah blah blah.
10223893	10228154	Look, he doesn't need forums because people talk about him on other forums.
10228574	10230275	Look, we're talking about him now.
10230335	10232396	This is free publicity he didn't pay for.
10233716	10234496	He doesn't need forums.
10235517	10236737	It would just be annoying, trust me.
10236897	10237557	He wouldn't do it.
10238638	10239198	I wouldn't want him.
10239625	10240886	Yeah, I wouldn't do it.
10241767	10245530	Chubs wants to know, what is the circumference of your left wrist?
10246110	10246991	Well, that's a good question.
10247331	10251594	I don't have one of those bendy rulers, though, like a fabric ruler that you would use to measure fabric that can bend around.
10251634	10253236	I don't have one of those, so I can't really measure it.
10254356	10257139	I know this is radio, but it's about that big.
10257959	10258660	Well, let's see here.
10259200	10266166	Okay, now everyone knows that if you point your finger like a gun, that is how big your penis is, supposedly, okay?
10266366	10266546	What?
10266566	10266706	What?
10266726	10266886	What?
10268974	10269515	Supposedly.
10269535	10271338	I don't have to worry about that.
10271358	10272580	Hold on, I'm looking at something here.
10272960	10273421	Oh, never mind.
10275484	10278950	So I would say roughly the circumference... Hold on, I need to go in the bathroom for a minute.
10282168	10284509	I would say mine's about 7 inches around.
10284549	10285810	Yeah, I'd say about that too.
10286450	10286870	My wrist.
10287070	10287571	Let's see.
10287931	10288611	Who cares?
10288991	10291913	My thumb is just touching my index finger.
10292793	10297695	You're supposed to use your index finger between your knuckles.
10297795	10299196	I'd say 12 inches.
10300857	10301617	Forget it.
10301757	10302157	12 inches.
10302898	10304338	Can you lick your elbow?
10304759	10305159	Forget it.
10313223	10319844	Dark Knight wants to know, oh Sky, I finally got an MP3 player that can handle multiple episodes of Orange Lounge Radio to go now.
10320304	10324165	So the only thing I worry about now is losing it because it's a small house MP3 player.
10325746	10327546	Put it on a string and wear it around your neck.
10327946	10330206	That's the only way I don't lose things is to wear it around my neck.
10330246	10331607	That's what I have to do with my work badge.
10331947	10337348	If I did not wear my work badge around my damn neck, I would lose it.
10337668	10341169	I don't care if I look stupid wearing my work badge around my neck or I look like a girl or something.
10341629	10344950	I've never lost the damn thing and I've never had to pay the $10 replacement fee.
10345010	10345550	So there you have it.
10345610	10346951	If you don't want to lose it, wear it around your neck.
10348671	10348951	Agree?
10349051	10349471	Disagree?
10350992	10351472	No comment?
10351652	10353532	Put a giant freaking chain on it.
10354473	10354933	Duct tape!
10354953	10356373	Duct tape it to your forehead.
10356913	10358254	You will never lose it again.
10358714	10361174	Also, when you pull the duct tape off, you'll have big red welts.
10362395	10362835	Go welts.
10364471	10366592	Whoops, that actually wasn't supposed to be a question on air.
10366612	10367513	That was a question to me.
10368633	10369874	That was a private question to me.
10371555	10381240	For those of you that like to have private conversations with a host during the show, that's fine and good, but just keep in mind if we're in the middle of a segment where I'm soliciting private messages, you might get caught in the middle.
10382001	10382581	Just a warning.
10383743	10391769	It's a good thing he didn't send something that says like, oh man, I just cheated on somebody or I don't know, whatever it is.
10392630	10394171	I go and read that all the time.
10394371	10396512	Oh my god, I secretly read Britney Spears.
10396532	10403237	Hey, remember that one time that Ryan's girlfriend called in for Ryan and Ryan wasn't here and she, you know.
10404178	10405939	Oh, I just shot myself in the foot.
10406079	10406400	Yeah.
10408300	10413306	OMGitsDoobz wants to know, why do all goths think they are vampires?
10413986	10415708	That is bullshit, okay?
10415768	10416669	That is bullshit.
10417210	10419212	Some of them think they're succubuses.
10420213	10421374	Succubi, thank you.
10421434	10422716	Succubi, whatever.
10423617	10425699	I have never once thought I was a vampire.
10426240	10427721	Or a succubus.
10427821	10429003	Some of them think they're...
10429543	10430924	Free!
10431165	10434547	Okay, you need to drop that, because that is old joke, okay?
10439492	10440453	Why is it so funny?
10440533	10440973	I don't know.
10441073	10442935	Oh, because she's a fat cow, that's why.
10444676	10451302	Of course, for those that don't remember, this is dating back to the old LiveJournal community on LiveJournal.
10451502	10456245	This is just more of a case of people making fun of what they don't understand.
10456665	10459067	She could become a fat cow like that.
10459307	10462849	No, the stupid bitch deserved it because she really was an idiot.
10463449	10468272	But I'm referring to this whole, oh, let's make fun of everybody who's goth or whatever.
10468632	10469193	You know what?
10470077	10473919	Don't poke fun at what you don't understand because it just makes you look like a big weirdo.
10473939	10475699	Why do all DDR players think they're Asian?
10476219	10477420	I can ask the same thing.
10477440	10477500	See?
10477620	10478300	And they don't.
10478620	10479141	Exactly.
10479261	10484883	Unless they happen to... Hey, honestly, I'm defending the goths here, okay?
10485023	10487764	SuicideGirls.com is fucking hot, okay?
10488164	10490065	Those goth chicks... Shut up, shut up, shut up.
10491125	10493147	Oh, now he has more questions here.
10493728	10499653	Oh, and why is Paris Hilton so famous for making a porn video?
10500094	10505398	I wish I could get a girl famous for having sex with me, just so I can say, do me, there's a future in it.
10509442	10509983	Oh, yeah.
10510503	10512165	Do me, there's a future in it.
10513786	10514707	Do me now!
10514727	10516709	I don't know.
10518183	10520547	Honestly, she's famous probably because she's rich.
10520688	10521770	Because their parents are rich.
10522811	10526017	She's famous because she blew her way to the top, literally.
10526478	10531427	DarkTetsuya wants to know, if Konami were to make a new challenge remix, what song would you like to see?
10536380	10537281	Cowgirl Survivor.
10537321	10537841	No, shut up.
10538342	10538982	Shut up right now.
10539002	10541765	A new challenge remix.
10541905	10542585	Oh, like Oni.
10542605	10547449	Yeah, remember back in Max 2 when they were trying to keep the series fresh, you know?
10547650	10549551	Well, then I fucking want Butterfly Oni.
10549751	10550852	No, I guess we already have that.
10550872	10551233	You can't do that.
10551253	10551893	It's a licensed song.
10552053	10552694	Ah, shut up.
10554916	10556297	Can we do Ultramix 2 stuff?
10557638	10558079	I suppose.
10558099	10558819	How about Gyrus?
10559980	10560721	I guess you could do that.
10561001	10561521	That's what I want.
10561541	10562042	I want Gyrus.
10562463	10566145	No, what they should honestly do is like, you know, I don't know.
10566586	10569908	I thought the whole idea with doing those Oni remixes was a cool idea.
10569928	10571569	I mean, it kept the series fresh.
10571609	10575231	It was like, ooh, that's kind of neat, you know, because they remixed all these songs.
10575291	10576632	And then they just said, you know what?
10576792	10578173	We just don't care anymore.
10579794	10583777	Let's give them another erotic song and put some eye toy support in there.
10584778	10585498	It won't know different.
10585558	10586119	I'll shut them up.
10587620	10591222	We'll change the color of the interface and then we'll tell them that we're starting over and we'll stop.
10594506	10605273	I think it's time to put the nail in the coffin of this lovely program known as Orange Lounge Radio and this mediocre show we had tonight.
10605753	10607354	I hope you found it to be as okay as I did.
10609534	10612375	Download our podcast, which is sure to be ten times better.
10613135	10613615	No, I'm kidding.
10614255	10614575	I kid.
10614675	10615596	Our show's awesome.
10615936	10616696	We're the best thing ever.
10616996	10619197	And so, you know, congratulations.
10619217	10619777	You're a part of it.
10620397	10626539	Final thoughts, Bradley, the loud mouth who can't shut up during our show so we can do a show here.
10626579	10627519	Bradley, your final thought.
10631520	10634741	Yeah, goodbye and good fish and all of that.
10635814	10639376	And my final thought is, I hate myself and I want to die.
10663922	10666084	And I gotta go get that shirt out of the dryer so I can wear it tonight.
10666705	10668567	And I have to go back to my castle.
10669788	10670569	DarkSakura.
10672331	10673252	I hate my life.
10673873	10678278	Every day I polish my revolver and I shoot my head like a rock star.
10679645	10684208	Alright, the final word of the show, I'm taking it tonight, because I don't get the final show often enough.
10684628	10687310	Tonight's final word, one word to sum it all up, you guys.
