1
00:01:00,922 --> 00:01:17,494
[SPEAKER_05]: The following live program is a special presentation of Orange Lounge Radio.

2
00:01:19,475 --> 00:01:23,438
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, you know, typically this week would be the calm before the storm.

3
00:01:23,838 --> 00:01:28,922
[SPEAKER_25]: Very quiet week before E3, when all the companies would announce their new stuff.

4
00:01:29,932 --> 00:01:31,853
[SPEAKER_25]: But boy, we didn't luck out that way this week.

5
00:01:31,913 --> 00:01:37,536
[SPEAKER_25]: I thought I'd be able to nap through tonight's show, but did things just explode this week or what?

6
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:45,561
[SPEAKER_25]: Just mass hysteria throughout the Bomani community this week.

7
00:01:45,601 --> 00:01:49,463
[SPEAKER_25]: If you've been living under a rock somewhere, I guess we'll have to explain it to you.

8
00:01:49,823 --> 00:01:51,084
[SPEAKER_25]: And it's not just one thing.

9
00:01:51,124 --> 00:01:54,686
[SPEAKER_25]: I realize one thing has been dominating the news this week, but there's more to it than that.

10
00:01:56,129 --> 00:01:57,689
[SPEAKER_25]: And I think that's going to be the running theme tonight.

11
00:01:57,709 --> 00:01:59,290
[SPEAKER_25]: There's more to it than it seems.

12
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:01,571
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the other thing is, I told you.

13
00:02:03,491 --> 00:02:04,591
[SPEAKER_25]: But did you let me know?

14
00:02:04,752 --> 00:02:06,212
[SPEAKER_25]: So there's two themes tonight.

15
00:02:07,072 --> 00:02:10,613
[SPEAKER_25]: Look closer than it seems, and Jamie told you so.

16
00:02:10,633 --> 00:02:11,734
[SPEAKER_25]: Exactly.

17
00:02:13,794 --> 00:02:15,455
[SPEAKER_25]: Orange Lounge, episode 142, right after this.

18
00:02:31,927 --> 00:02:37,328
[SPEAKER_23]: Orange Lounge Radio is presented in the TMI sound format.

19
00:03:03,815 --> 00:03:04,195
Oh, God.

[SPEAKER_09]: Call me Daddy.

21
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:28,532
[SPEAKER_06]: Orange Lounge may contain adult content.

22

[SPEAKER_06]: Orange Lounge may contain many four-letter words.

23
00:03:33,595 --> 00:03:36,696
[SPEAKER_06]: Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity.

24
00:03:37,397 --> 00:03:43,840
[SPEAKER_06]: Orange Lounge may contain plenty of... Just kidding.

25
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:47,662
[SPEAKER_24]: Orange Lounge Radio will not contain any of that in this episode.

26
00:03:47,762 --> 00:03:49,603
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, isn't that special?

27
00:03:54,173 --> 00:04:12,550

34
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:55,796
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, everyone!

35
00:04:58,218 --> 00:04:59,479
[SPEAKER_25]: You're very perky tonight.

36
00:04:59,979 --> 00:05:01,040
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm such a faker.

37
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:03,081
[SPEAKER_25]: As opposed to the fucking bitch you were last week.

38
00:05:03,522 --> 00:05:04,082
[SPEAKER_25]: Just kidding.

39
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:08,326
[SPEAKER_25]: I just wanted that reaction.

40
00:05:11,363 --> 00:05:12,744
[SPEAKER_25]: Aw, I love you.

41
00:05:12,824 --> 00:05:14,566
[SPEAKER_25]: Aw, I love you.

42
00:05:14,626 --> 00:05:15,267
[SPEAKER_25]: You know I love you.

43
00:05:15,727 --> 00:05:16,307
[SPEAKER_25]: I loved you.

44
00:05:17,689 --> 00:05:18,349
[SPEAKER_25]: I loved you.

45
00:05:18,589 --> 00:05:18,830
[SPEAKER_25]: What?

46
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:19,350
[SPEAKER_25]: What?

47
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:19,811
[SPEAKER_13]: What?

48
00:05:19,831 --> 00:05:19,971
[SPEAKER_13]: What?

49
00:05:19,991 --> 00:05:20,131
[SPEAKER_13]: What?

50
00:05:20,151 --> 00:05:20,271
[SPEAKER_13]: What?

51
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:20,431
[SPEAKER_13]: What?

52
00:05:20,451 --> 00:05:20,591
[SPEAKER_25]: What?

53
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:21,672
[SPEAKER_25]: What?

54
00:05:21,972 --> 00:05:22,513
[SPEAKER_13]: What?

55
00:05:23,834 --> 00:05:25,195
[SPEAKER_25]: Look, it's a three-hour show, lady.

56
00:05:25,215 --> 00:05:27,157
[SPEAKER_25]: We got a lot to talk about tonight.

57
00:05:27,657 --> 00:05:27,918
[SPEAKER_25]: All right.

58
00:05:28,598 --> 00:05:31,241
[SPEAKER_25]: Tech Master Loki on vacation tonight, actually.

59
00:05:32,642 --> 00:05:38,347
[SPEAKER_25]: From what I understand, the woman is making him put out tonight so that he can attend E3 next week.

60
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:41,410
[SPEAKER_25]: or something like that.

61
00:05:42,051 --> 00:05:46,293
[SPEAKER_25]: I think it's actually not as crude as I put it, but you know.

62
00:05:46,613 --> 00:05:51,715
[SPEAKER_03]: I think she'd be thanking us for taking him off her hands for a while.

63
00:05:51,795 --> 00:05:52,555
[SPEAKER_25]: Just kidding.

64
00:05:52,575 --> 00:05:55,417
[SPEAKER_25]: The politically correct version of that story doesn't equal as good ratings.

65
00:05:55,737 --> 00:06:02,900
[SPEAKER_25]: So what's very interesting about tonight's show is that it's just DarkSakura and I. There are no special guests here.

66
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,720
[SPEAKER_25]: Flashback!

67
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:07,462
[SPEAKER_25]: As of yet, do we still have the folks coming that you were mentioning earlier?

68
00:06:08,007 --> 00:06:08,867
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know.

69
00:06:08,927 --> 00:06:09,908
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't have a confirmation.

70
00:06:09,968 --> 00:06:10,548
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, we don't know.

71
00:06:10,668 --> 00:06:12,609
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't want to go eat at a buffet at the casino.

72
00:06:12,629 --> 00:06:14,109
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, that's a good place.

73
00:06:14,149 --> 00:06:14,489
[SPEAKER_25]: So anyway.

74
00:06:14,989 --> 00:06:17,050
[SPEAKER_25]: So it's just going to be DarkSakura and I tonight, feeling the love.

75
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:22,532
[SPEAKER_25]: Which kind of works out because I know everybody and their mom wants to get on the Skype line tonight.

76
00:06:24,072 --> 00:06:27,173
[SPEAKER_25]: Because of some news story that was going on.

77
00:06:27,273 --> 00:06:29,774
[SPEAKER_25]: Something about... Something about like...

78
00:06:30,754 --> 00:06:31,735
[SPEAKER_25]: A jaw suit?

79
00:06:31,895 --> 00:06:32,655
[SPEAKER_25]: Or a raw suit?

80
00:06:32,755 --> 00:06:33,156
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know.

81
00:06:33,276 --> 00:06:33,896
[SPEAKER_25]: Something like that.

82
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:35,137
[SPEAKER_02]: Raw suit!

83
00:06:36,178 --> 00:06:36,938
[SPEAKER_02]: Raw suit up!

84
00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:41,842
[SPEAKER_25]: This is going to be an interesting show tonight.

85
00:06:41,862 --> 00:06:45,384
[SPEAKER_25]: So definitely check out our Skype line, www.orangelaunchradio.com.

00:06:47,746 --> 00:06:55,371
[SPEAKER_25]: And we'll be back after a quick break to talk about many things going on this week, including, you know... That.

88
00:06:55,752 --> 00:06:56,052
[SPEAKER_25]: That.

89
00:06:56,072 --> 00:06:56,152
[SPEAKER_25]: That.

90
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:00,011
[SPEAKER_25]: of which we say, you got served.

91
00:07:00,532 --> 00:07:00,932
[SPEAKER_25]: Literally.

92
00:07:01,873 --> 00:07:03,354
[SPEAKER_02]: Bitch, I told you so.

93
00:07:04,454 --> 00:07:05,475
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright, we'll be back after this.

94
00:07:05,515 --> 00:07:07,336
[SPEAKER_25]: In this break, some potpourri.

95
00:07:08,037 --> 00:07:08,617
[SPEAKER_25]: Some potpourri.

96
00:07:08,998 --> 00:07:10,298
[SPEAKER_02]: In frilly pastel colors.

97
00:07:10,338 --> 00:07:16,222
[SPEAKER_25]: And in fact, we're going to have Bimani coexisting with some like one or two in the groove songs.

98
00:07:16,483 --> 00:07:18,164
[SPEAKER_25]: The way some people would like to see it.

99
00:07:19,184 --> 00:07:19,665
[SPEAKER_25]: But we'll see.

100
00:07:19,685 --> 00:07:22,126
[SPEAKER_02]: Can't we all just get along?

101
00:07:22,146 --> 00:07:23,447
[SPEAKER_25]: We'll find out.

102
00:07:24,128 --> 00:07:25,228
[SPEAKER_25]: We'll be back after this.

103
00:07:25,629 --> 00:07:26,129
[SPEAKER_25]: Starting off

104
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:33,168
[SPEAKER_25]: from Keyboard Mania, Sensation I'm feeling a sensation and I gotta go clean up so we'll be back after this

105
00:09:15,189 --> 00:09:15,430
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

106
00:10:56,928 --> 00:10:57,149
Thank you.

107
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:28,843
[SPEAKER_17]: My name is Susha.

108
00:12:29,345 --> 00:12:30,208
[SPEAKER_17]: I give you my kiss.

00:14:31,483 --> 00:14:35,804
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Lounge Radio is proud to present a celebrity interview.

110
00:14:36,664 --> 00:14:38,325
[SPEAKER_25]: Can you introduce yourself for our listeners?

111
00:14:38,785 --> 00:14:39,605
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm Miss Cleo.

112
00:14:40,145 --> 00:14:41,745
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, it's great to have you on the show today.

113
00:14:42,085 --> 00:14:43,226
[SPEAKER_19]: Hello, how are you today?

114
00:14:43,726 --> 00:14:44,666
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm great, thanks.

115
00:14:44,846 --> 00:14:45,866
[SPEAKER_19]: Did you have a question?

116
00:14:46,286 --> 00:14:52,207
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, yes, actually I wanted to know... Can I please have your first name only and your birth date, please?

117
00:14:53,328 --> 00:14:57,929
[SPEAKER_25]: Uh, well, no, I actually just wanted to know what you thought of Orange Lounge Radio.

118
00:14:58,189 --> 00:14:59,009
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright, go ahead.

119
00:14:59,417 --> 00:15:02,599
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, what do you think of Loki, one of the three hosts of Orange Lounge Radio?

120
00:15:02,939 --> 00:15:03,839
[SPEAKER_19]: Is he incarcerated?

121
00:15:04,459 --> 00:15:05,820
[SPEAKER_25]: Uh, actually, no, he's not.

122
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,121
[SPEAKER_25]: But what do you think of the ever-ranty DarkSakura?

123
00:15:08,281 --> 00:15:09,562
[SPEAKER_19]: Hi, dear, how are you?

124
00:15:10,142 --> 00:15:10,862
[SPEAKER_19]: I love you.

125
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:12,603
[SPEAKER_25]: I see you two must know each other.

126
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:14,004
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, what do you think of Skye?

127
00:15:14,304 --> 00:15:16,225
[SPEAKER_19]: Did he used to play football when he was in high school?

128
00:15:16,485 --> 00:15:17,926
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, actually, no, he didn't.

129
00:15:19,146 --> 00:15:21,007
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, what do you think of Intern Zero?

130
00:15:21,447 --> 00:15:24,769
[SPEAKER_19]: I want you to really remember the pill, all right?

131
00:15:25,319 --> 00:15:27,279
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm seeing some forgetting, possibly.

132
00:15:27,579 --> 00:15:30,520
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'm seeing a new baby in the next three months.

133
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:31,660
[SPEAKER_25]: Right.

134
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:34,881
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, well, thanks for being on Orange Lounge Radio today.

135
00:15:35,021 --> 00:15:40,062
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, I don't mean to sidetrack your question here, but who are all of these nosy people?

136
00:15:40,322 --> 00:15:43,642
[SPEAKER_19]: Outside influences I'm seeing around you by the moon card.

137
00:15:43,822 --> 00:15:44,762
[SPEAKER_05]: Get away from me.

138
00:15:47,283 --> 00:15:52,104
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Lounge Radio, helping to free your mind and spirit.

139
00:15:52,584 --> 00:15:53,404
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm Miss Cleo.

140
00:15:53,764 --> 00:15:54,444
[SPEAKER_19]: I love you.

141
00:15:57,597 --> 00:15:58,157
[SPEAKER_25]: I love you.

142
00:16:28,273 --> 00:16:28,653
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

143
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:37,799
[SPEAKER_25]: So, the only thing that's keeping us sane tonight is just acting a little crazy, so you'll have to excuse... I don't know about you.

144
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:39,680
[SPEAKER_25]: Listen, barnyard.

145
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:45,103
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know if it's just me, but I've been kind of like in a weird funk all week.

146
00:16:47,684 --> 00:16:49,225
[SPEAKER_25]: Why don't I just talk to myself tonight?

147
00:16:49,865 --> 00:16:50,746
[SPEAKER_25]: Sorry.

148
00:16:51,887 --> 00:16:54,208
[SPEAKER_02]: No, well, I don't blame you.

149
00:16:55,718 --> 00:17:04,464
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know, tonight is supposed to be the show, we're packing during the show, the Survivor finale's on and I'm having to miss it.

150
00:17:04,885 --> 00:17:06,566
[SPEAKER_02]: You reality TV whore.

151
00:17:06,586 --> 00:17:12,931
[SPEAKER_25]: I know, and don't freaking spoil it for me in the chat room, I swear to God that'll be like an instant ban for life if you spoil it for me.

152
00:17:13,151 --> 00:17:14,332
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody die!

153
00:17:14,952 --> 00:17:15,612
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, everybody die.

154
00:17:15,652 --> 00:17:16,333
[SPEAKER_02]: Hurricane!

155
00:17:16,713 --> 00:17:17,334
[SPEAKER_25]: That's how it ends.

156
00:17:18,775 --> 00:17:19,755
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to televise it too.

157
00:17:20,676 --> 00:17:21,777
[SPEAKER_25]: And then Loki's not even here.

158
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:24,851
[SPEAKER_02]: I have enough anger for this show.

159
00:17:24,871 --> 00:17:25,251
[SPEAKER_25]: Petite love.

160
00:17:25,271 --> 00:17:26,632
[SPEAKER_25]: We want ice cream.

161
00:17:26,672 --> 00:17:27,393
[SPEAKER_25]: We have to acknowledge it.

162
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:28,213
[SPEAKER_25]: We just... We...

163
00:17:52,921 --> 00:17:58,023
[SPEAKER_25]: It was supposed to be that everything is quiet the week before E3, and now just the shit hit the fan.

164
00:17:58,423 --> 00:17:58,903
[SPEAKER_25]: Seriously.

165
00:17:59,303 --> 00:17:59,904
[SPEAKER_25]: In so many ways.

166
00:18:00,864 --> 00:18:03,265
[SPEAKER_02]: The shit hitting the fan had excellent timing.

167
00:18:04,985 --> 00:18:05,285
[SPEAKER_25]: Anyway.

168
00:18:06,526 --> 00:18:10,407
[SPEAKER_25]: Let's talk about How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day?

169
00:18:10,447 --> 00:18:11,828
[SPEAKER_25]: We always do start off the show this way.

170
00:18:12,148 --> 00:18:14,388
[SPEAKER_25]: I was a little worried about doing How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day?

171
00:18:14,428 --> 00:18:18,510
[SPEAKER_25]: Because usually we have a studio full of like ten people, and we would have never gotten to the lawsuit stuff.

172
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:20,731
[SPEAKER_25]: But since it's just you and I, I suppose we have the time.

173
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:21,831
[SPEAKER_25]: So, How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day?

174
00:18:22,529 --> 00:18:26,430
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, first of all, to be grammatically correct, that would be you and me.

175
00:18:28,771 --> 00:18:29,232
[SPEAKER_14]: Whatever.

176
00:18:30,652 --> 00:18:32,393
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, that is one of my grammatical pet peeves.

177
00:18:33,133 --> 00:18:34,634
[SPEAKER_02]: But everybody does it somewhere.

178
00:18:36,154 --> 00:18:41,696
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, my week has been homework, homework, homework, homework, and homework.

179
00:18:41,736 --> 00:18:43,657
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been doing two weeks of homework in one week.

180
00:18:44,797 --> 00:18:49,259
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I finished... What the fuck did I do?

181
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:51,620
[SPEAKER_02]: I did, um...

182
00:18:53,951 --> 00:18:56,433
[SPEAKER_02]: My color harmony painting, I finished that.

183
00:18:56,574 --> 00:18:57,014
[SPEAKER_02]: Turned it in.

184
00:18:57,434 --> 00:18:57,795
[SPEAKER_02]: Gotta be.

185
00:19:00,697 --> 00:19:01,278
[SPEAKER_25]: Excuse me.

186
00:19:01,338 --> 00:19:01,678
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

187
00:19:02,419 --> 00:19:03,480
[SPEAKER_02]: I burped off camera.

188
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:07,984
[SPEAKER_02]: What the hell are you talking about?

189
00:19:08,004 --> 00:19:09,686
[SPEAKER_02]: I cut out a bunch of pictures for my montage.

190
00:19:09,726 --> 00:19:10,707
[SPEAKER_02]: I still have a few more to do.

191
00:19:13,009 --> 00:19:14,150
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is my final on Monday.

192
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:17,733
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to do fan art as my digital illustration.

193
00:19:17,813 --> 00:19:18,694
[SPEAKER_02]: How cool is that?

194
00:19:19,881 --> 00:19:24,644
[SPEAKER_02]: I was up until 5am writing a tutorial on how to make live journal icons in PaintShop Pro.

195
00:19:25,585 --> 00:19:27,226
[SPEAKER_02]: My tutorial looks pretty damn good, by the way.

196
00:19:30,689 --> 00:19:33,771
[SPEAKER_02]: Had Adventures at Target at closing time.

197
00:19:35,652 --> 00:19:41,756
[SPEAKER_28]: I went to Rapture on Thursday, which was very fun.

198
00:19:41,856 --> 00:19:43,157
[SPEAKER_28]: Rapture.

199
00:19:43,838 --> 00:19:45,579
[SPEAKER_28]: Not in the blondie sense, this is in the...

200
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:49,932
[SPEAKER_28]: Hi, let's all wear black and listen to industrial music and get very drunk.

201
00:19:50,632 --> 00:19:51,352
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really fun.

202
00:19:51,392 --> 00:19:51,972
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a good time.

203
00:19:55,014 --> 00:19:57,415
[SPEAKER_02]: I drank whiskey for the first time in like a year.

204
00:19:57,695 --> 00:19:58,235
[SPEAKER_02]: It was good.

205
00:19:59,515 --> 00:20:00,116
[SPEAKER_02]: And Guinness.

206
00:20:00,736 --> 00:20:01,696
[SPEAKER_02]: Guinness and whiskey.

207
00:20:02,457 --> 00:20:03,337
[SPEAKER_02]: Makes me happy, girl.

208
00:20:07,939 --> 00:20:10,300
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just been getting ready for E3, really.

209
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:14,161
[SPEAKER_02]: Getting stuff together, getting crap off my laptop.

210
00:20:14,862 --> 00:20:15,722
[SPEAKER_02]: Went to Fry's today.

211
00:20:16,664 --> 00:20:17,764
[SPEAKER_02]: I bought Pulp Fiction on DVD today

212
00:20:44,271 --> 00:20:52,175
[SPEAKER_02]: It was $14 for the special edition, but I already had it on Laserdisc, the four disc set.

213
00:20:52,555 --> 00:20:56,577
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I have and watch Laserdiscs, and our Laserdisc player still works.

214
00:20:57,938 --> 00:21:07,563
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, and I went to, not Fry's, but to Dimple Records, it's one of the local resale places, you know, used records and stuff.

215
00:21:08,344 --> 00:21:12,986
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, records are those big discs that are hiding in your parents' garage.

216
00:21:13,979 --> 00:21:15,300
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't Copy That Floppy

217
00:21:38,004 --> 00:21:38,764
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't remember.

218
00:21:38,784 --> 00:21:41,786
[SPEAKER_25]: I can't even remember our own shows inside jokes.

219
00:21:41,906 --> 00:21:44,227
[SPEAKER_28]: Do not copy the CD!

220
00:21:44,607 --> 00:21:46,829
[SPEAKER_10]: You'll go to hell if you do!

221
00:21:48,149 --> 00:21:50,791
[SPEAKER_25]: The reference I'm making, of course, is to an old Captain Jack CD.

222
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:51,991
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm going to have to find this now.

223
00:21:54,172 --> 00:21:55,693
[SPEAKER_02]: Which, of course, is funny since you have it copied.

224
00:21:56,854 --> 00:21:57,354
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, exactly.

225
00:21:57,394 --> 00:21:59,415
[SPEAKER_02]: That is irony.

226
00:21:59,495 --> 00:22:04,538
[SPEAKER_02]: I also spent the week downloading a bunch of Radiohead and The Bees.

227
00:22:05,387 --> 00:22:09,628
[SPEAKER_02]: and Super Furry Animals, which everybody got to hear at the beginning of my show on Tuesday.

228
00:22:09,968 --> 00:22:14,569
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, of course, no show on Tuesday because I will be in a car.

229
00:22:16,089 --> 00:22:16,910
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, can't do that.

230
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:20,410
[SPEAKER_25]: Can I interrupt for one sec?

231
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:20,630
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

232
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:21,331
[SPEAKER_25]: Please?

233
00:22:21,411 --> 00:22:21,651
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay.

234
00:22:23,631 --> 00:22:32,593
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey folks, this was CG Radio presenting you Captain Jack's Greatest Summer Hits.

235
00:22:33,251 --> 00:23:01,868
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep the spirit, the sun is shining wherever you are And don't forget, copy kills music So, don't copy, buy our records Bye-bye, the party never ends Copy kills music Thank you, Captain Jack Ow, music dead Copied Ironically, that was copied from the original album I can't think of anything else, so I'm just not going to say anything

236
00:23:02,307 --> 00:23:03,789
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm going to caress the ferret.

237
00:23:06,632 --> 00:23:14,740
[SPEAKER_25]: By the way, you need to figure out which ferret is being sacrificed to the giant Katamari at E3, because one of them will be stuck on the Katamari at E3.

238
00:23:16,322 --> 00:23:16,882
[SPEAKER_25]: Get over it.

239
00:23:18,644 --> 00:23:19,685
[SPEAKER_25]: For those of you guys that haven't heard...

240
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,421
[SPEAKER_25]: E3 Catamari Ball X-Rated Clothing

241
00:23:43,729 --> 00:23:45,915
[SPEAKER_25]: Aferit onto the Katamari at E3.

242
00:23:45,935 --> 00:23:47,519
[SPEAKER_25]: We'll take a picture and of course post it on the net.

243
00:23:47,539 --> 00:23:48,802
[SPEAKER_02]: We should put business cards on there too.

244
00:23:49,443 --> 00:23:51,569
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm putting Reject False Icon stickers on there.

245
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:55,211
[SPEAKER_25]: And we might put one of our media handouts on there as well.

246
00:23:55,251 --> 00:23:57,372
[SPEAKER_25]: We're set for E3 this year.

247
00:23:58,252 --> 00:24:04,774
[SPEAKER_25]: DarkSakura has twice the business cards she had last year, because she was the only one of us to give away all her business cards by the end of the second day.

248
00:24:04,894 --> 00:24:06,254
[SPEAKER_25]: And I gave away some of yours.

249
00:24:06,294 --> 00:24:09,555
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, and she started giving away mine, and I only had like five left.

250
00:24:09,915 --> 00:24:12,876
[SPEAKER_25]: So Jamie now has twice as many cards at least this year.

251
00:24:12,956 --> 00:24:14,216
[SPEAKER_25]: And you know I whore us out.

252
00:24:14,376 --> 00:24:16,277
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh yeah, so I'm excited about that.

253
00:24:17,344 --> 00:24:20,566
[SPEAKER_25]: Anyway, sorry, um, my week and my day.

254
00:24:20,786 --> 00:24:24,088
[SPEAKER_25]: I played a lot of PSO Blue Burst, because that's in beta right now.

255
00:24:24,128 --> 00:24:24,988
[SPEAKER_02]: I played that too.

256
00:24:25,028 --> 00:24:26,629
[SPEAKER_25]: And that makes it, yeah, we all played.

257
00:24:26,709 --> 00:24:30,331
[SPEAKER_25]: Me, you, Miklatov, and one of your friends from the Gorillas boards, right?

258
00:24:30,451 --> 00:24:31,012
[SPEAKER_25]: We were all playing.

259
00:24:31,372 --> 00:24:34,994
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, um, well, my character is like super gothy for a while.

260
00:24:36,335 --> 00:24:39,336
[SPEAKER_25]: Ooh, sorry, I just, I really like this thought from the chat room.

261
00:24:39,456 --> 00:24:42,298
[SPEAKER_25]: MPQ is asking, put Ultra Kate on the Katamari.

262
00:24:43,151 --> 00:24:43,893
[SPEAKER_25]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

263
00:24:54,971 --> 00:24:56,052
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I wanted to do?

264
00:24:56,192 --> 00:24:56,433
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

265
00:24:56,793 --> 00:25:05,400
[SPEAKER_02]: If I have one of those little PDF files of the Prince cutouts, if I can take my X-Acto knife to it, if someone can put it together, we can actually stick the Prince on there.

266
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,721
[SPEAKER_25]: Let's install Linux on the Katamari.

267
00:25:08,062 --> 00:25:08,682
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah!

268
00:25:09,163 --> 00:25:11,144
[SPEAKER_02]: We should put like a big Linux penguin on it.

269
00:25:11,164 --> 00:25:13,486
[SPEAKER_25]: Or as Petra said, put NetBSD.

270
00:25:13,806 --> 00:25:19,491
[SPEAKER_25]: But I think Linux is really the one that, you know... We should put the Linux penguin on it.

271
00:25:20,191 --> 00:25:20,452
[SPEAKER_25]: Maybe.

272
00:25:20,532 --> 00:25:22,093
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, chatroom, okay, chatroom.

273
00:25:23,477 --> 00:25:28,761
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, go ahead and PM me with suggestions for what should go on the Katamari.

274
00:25:29,402 --> 00:25:31,023
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll, uh, we'll, uh...

275
00:25:32,148 --> 00:25:33,569
[SPEAKER_25]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

276
00:25:58,363 --> 00:26:01,264
[SPEAKER_25]: We have an email address set up so you can send us questions.

277
00:26:01,644 --> 00:26:11,568
[SPEAKER_25]: If you want us to be the investigative reporters and go investigate a game for you and find out some details and bring back or you just have a question about E3 in general or you want a picture with something, I don't know.

278
00:26:12,068 --> 00:26:16,470
[SPEAKER_25]: You're going to send us an email and then we will do that and give you the answer on the podcast.

279
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:18,031
[SPEAKER_02]: Kalamari on the Katamari.

280
00:26:19,791 --> 00:26:20,051
[SPEAKER_25]: Anyway.

281
00:26:22,172 --> 00:26:24,453
[SPEAKER_25]: We should do a list list tonight even though it's just us.

282
00:26:25,205 --> 00:26:25,665
[SPEAKER_25]: Just us?

283
00:26:25,825 --> 00:26:27,466
[SPEAKER_25]: We could have my roommate participate.

284
00:26:27,487 --> 00:26:29,268
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to participate in the listless tonight?

285
00:26:30,268 --> 00:26:32,590
[SPEAKER_25]: My roommate has no idea what he's in for.

286
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:33,751
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes.

287
00:26:34,151 --> 00:26:35,011
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay.

288
00:26:35,031 --> 00:26:35,372
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.

289
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:36,572
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, then we'll have to think of something.

290
00:26:36,772 --> 00:26:39,414
[SPEAKER_25]: But you have to remember... We need to do things to put on the Katamari.

291
00:26:39,534 --> 00:26:42,996
[SPEAKER_25]: Chris, well, see, but Chris, do you even know what Katamari Damashii is, Chris?

292
00:26:43,016 --> 00:26:44,037
[SPEAKER_25]: Um, yeah.

293
00:26:44,057 --> 00:26:44,517
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, he does know.

294
00:26:44,858 --> 00:26:45,378
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, he does know.

295
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:46,490
[SPEAKER_08]: I do know.

296
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:49,572
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, so then maybe we can do that as a listless later tonight.

297
00:26:49,993 --> 00:26:51,093
[SPEAKER_25]: We'll get somebody on Skype, too.

298
00:26:51,133 --> 00:26:52,294
[SPEAKER_25]: In fact, I already have somebody of mine.

299
00:26:52,314 --> 00:26:54,075
[SPEAKER_25]: We'll get a special guest on Skype.

300
00:26:54,795 --> 00:26:55,616
[SPEAKER_02]: We can do this.

301
00:26:55,736 --> 00:27:01,079
[SPEAKER_02]: Who needs that angry person with his spiky hair and trench coat?

302
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:02,901
[SPEAKER_25]: He's probably getting laid right now.

303
00:27:05,002 --> 00:27:05,222
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

304
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:07,640
[SPEAKER_25]: Crickets, Crickets, Tricks, Tricks

305
00:27:35,703 --> 00:27:42,705
[SPEAKER_25]: But you also took my class ring, which was in a front compartment in the car, and then a Commodore 64 monitor, which I don't know why it was in the backseat.

306
00:27:42,785 --> 00:27:43,506
[SPEAKER_25]: It just was, okay?

307
00:27:43,566 --> 00:27:43,986
[SPEAKER_25]: Just shut up.

308
00:27:45,026 --> 00:27:48,908
[SPEAKER_25]: So, yeah, my car barcode got broken into.

309
00:27:48,948 --> 00:27:49,368
[SPEAKER_25]: That sucks.

310
00:27:49,608 --> 00:27:57,130
[SPEAKER_25]: You know what else sucks is calling the police department to file the report, and then you ask them, have you heard of any others, any other break-ins in the area last night?

311
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:58,651
[SPEAKER_25]: And they go, well, you know...

312
00:28:00,683 --> 00:28:06,648
[SPEAKER_25]: We're really understaffed right now and I haven't gotten to the messages from last night yet because we're all volunteers here and I'm the only one here.

313
00:28:07,028 --> 00:28:11,612
[SPEAKER_25]: And I'm just like, I feel safe here in lovely California.

314
00:28:11,632 --> 00:28:13,174
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially for a complex of this size.

315
00:28:14,955 --> 00:28:15,616
[SPEAKER_25]: No, it's the city.

316
00:28:15,656 --> 00:28:17,037
[SPEAKER_25]: It was the city's police department.

317
00:28:18,298 --> 00:28:20,480
[SPEAKER_25]: The city is staffed by volunteers.

318
00:28:21,441 --> 00:28:22,362
[SPEAKER_25]: That's retarded.

319
00:28:25,544 --> 00:28:26,045
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm going to cry.

320
00:28:27,048 --> 00:28:31,390
[SPEAKER_25]: So, by the way, if Orange Launch Radio, if we get shot or something and we die, you'll know why.

321
00:28:31,771 --> 00:28:33,492
[SPEAKER_25]: Because the police is staffed by volunteers.

322
00:28:33,832 --> 00:28:37,954
[SPEAKER_02]: Send all angry letters to Sacramento City PD, blah blah blah, blah blah blah.

323
00:28:39,795 --> 00:28:42,697
[SPEAKER_25]: Anyway, that's my week and my day, pretty much.

324
00:28:43,737 --> 00:28:44,678
[SPEAKER_25]: How was your week and your day?

325
00:28:45,718 --> 00:28:46,139
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, great.

326
00:28:46,859 --> 00:28:49,140
[SPEAKER_25]: Let's talk about the big news this week.

327
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,561
[SPEAKER_25]: Huge news, let's just get into it.

328
00:28:51,601 --> 00:28:54,283
[SPEAKER_25]: I know a lot of you guys are tuning in tonight because you want to hear our thoughts on it.

329
00:28:54,955 --> 00:29:01,716
[SPEAKER_25]: In case you've been living under a rock or something, I'm going to play for you guys our first news break.

330
00:29:01,756 --> 00:29:06,677
[SPEAKER_25]: We actually did a news break earlier this week because we actually had some new news.

331
00:29:07,938 --> 00:29:09,858
[SPEAKER_25]: So, let's see if I can find it.

332
00:29:12,118 --> 00:29:13,459
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm well prepared for this right now.

333
00:29:14,679 --> 00:29:15,499
[SPEAKER_25]: Give me just a minute, guys.

334
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,300
[SPEAKER_25]: We apologize for this technical break.

335
00:29:23,041 --> 00:29:24,041
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't, but Rob does.

336
00:29:24,261 --> 00:29:24,621
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn it.

337
00:29:25,965 --> 00:29:27,026
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm all embarrassed and stuff.

338
00:29:27,166 --> 00:29:28,667
[SPEAKER_25]: I thought I had that file ready to go.

339
00:29:29,708 --> 00:29:30,088
[SPEAKER_25]: There it is.

340
00:29:30,168 --> 00:29:30,688
[SPEAKER_25]: All right, here we go.

341
00:29:30,708 --> 00:29:31,509
[SPEAKER_03]: The spirit laughed at you.

342
00:29:31,549 --> 00:29:36,472
[SPEAKER_25]: Here was the news break, our very first Orange Lounge Radio news break from earlier this week that tells the story of what's been going on.

343
00:29:37,893 --> 00:29:40,214
[SPEAKER_25]: Orange Lounge Radio news break.

344
00:29:41,615 --> 00:29:44,657
[SPEAKER_25]: Sky here with an Orange Lounge Radio news update for this May 11, 2005.

345
00:29:46,542 --> 00:29:57,777
[SPEAKER_25]: Orange Lounge Radio has learned that Konami of Japan has filed an injunction against Roxor Games, claiming trademark and patent infringement against Dance Dance Revolution with Roxor's own game, In the Groove.

346
00:29:58,237 --> 00:30:00,901
[SPEAKER_25]: In a press release posted on Konami of Japan's website...

347
00:30:01,206 --> 00:30:01,946
[SPEAKER_25]: Yada, yada, yada, yada.

348
00:30:02,066 --> 00:30:03,126
[SPEAKER_25]: Plug for the website.

349
00:30:03,166 --> 00:30:04,787
[SPEAKER_25]: You're obviously already there.

350
00:30:04,847 --> 00:30:04,887
[SPEAKER_25]: So...

351
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:37,956
[SPEAKER_25]: That was the first bit of news that came out, is that Konami of Japan put that press release on their site that says, you know, we've finally discovered that there's this game in the U.S.

352
00:30:39,698 --> 00:30:42,880
[SPEAKER_25]: that might be kind of infringing on some of our rights here.

353
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,081
[SPEAKER_02]: At that point, I fell out of my chair.

354
00:30:46,142 --> 00:30:46,882
[SPEAKER_25]: Laughing or what?

355
00:30:46,923 --> 00:30:48,444
[SPEAKER_02]: Laughing my ass off.

356
00:30:48,744 --> 00:30:49,024
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay.

357
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:57,005
[SPEAKER_25]: But I want to get your clear thoughts later, because you're not really an in-the-groove hater, because you were just here last week saying, it's not that bad.

358
00:30:57,205 --> 00:30:57,465
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

359
00:30:57,525 --> 00:30:57,726
[SPEAKER_25]: Right?

360
00:30:58,366 --> 00:30:59,527
[SPEAKER_25]: But I was still laughing my ass off.

361
00:30:59,707 --> 00:31:01,089
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah.

362
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:16,163
[SPEAKER_25]: And then a little later in the day, actually, what happened over on DDR Freak is that Cutris, one of the admins over there, actually dug up, like, all smoke and gun style, managed to dig up the actual copy of

363
00:31:17,356 --> 00:31:21,439
[SPEAKER_25]: Actual copy, like you would see on thesmokinggun.com when celebrities get busted and stuff.

364
00:31:21,859 --> 00:31:24,021
[SPEAKER_25]: You dug up the actual copy of the injunction.

365
00:31:24,961 --> 00:31:25,562
[SPEAKER_25]: That's cool.

366
00:31:25,662 --> 00:31:28,304
[SPEAKER_25]: Now I could sit here and read the whole damn thing, but it's boring as hell.

367
00:31:28,804 --> 00:31:29,905
[SPEAKER_02]: I read it over on DDR Freak.

368
00:31:29,985 --> 00:31:30,485
[SPEAKER_02]: And what did you think?

369
00:31:31,226 --> 00:31:40,072
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, well, being that I did just get out of the business class last semester, a lot of it, you know, see, this is everything that I had pointed out.

370
00:31:40,672 --> 00:31:44,175
[SPEAKER_02]: They are using freaking DDR cabinets, which are a patent of Konami.

371
00:31:45,383 --> 00:31:48,225
[SPEAKER_02]: They had no legal precedent to use it.

372
00:31:48,945 --> 00:32:01,853
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing is that I think where Konami is getting the big issue from this is that with all those other little two bit ones, they're not going to make a whole bunch of money on it.

373
00:32:01,873 --> 00:32:03,374
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not trying to mass market it.

374
00:32:03,454 --> 00:32:07,096
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's at the point that Endergroove is trying to go to the home market.

375
00:32:08,138 --> 00:32:10,960
[SPEAKER_25]: I think you're hitting on a big thing here, because I know a lot of what I've been reading.

376
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:13,222
[SPEAKER_25]: And this news just exploded on the internet.

377
00:32:13,262 --> 00:32:17,185
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, god, the DDR Freak thread hit like 300 posts in a day.

378
00:32:17,205 --> 00:32:17,926
[SPEAKER_25]: It was insane.

379
00:32:19,367 --> 00:32:20,128
[SPEAKER_25]: They're lit up.

380
00:32:20,248 --> 00:32:20,888
[SPEAKER_25]: The boards are lit up.

381
00:32:21,149 --> 00:32:23,410
[SPEAKER_25]: And people are going, go Konami, go!

382
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:27,714
[SPEAKER_25]: And then people are saying, you know, fuck Konami for killing in the groove.

383
00:32:27,754 --> 00:32:29,515
[SPEAKER_25]: And people are saying, boycott Konami!

384
00:32:29,555 --> 00:32:31,277
[SPEAKER_25]: And people are saying, boycott the boycotters!

385
00:32:31,357 --> 00:32:33,538
[SPEAKER_25]: And it's just very polarizing.

386
00:32:33,678 --> 00:32:34,439
[SPEAKER_13]: I boycott you!

387
00:32:34,859 --> 00:32:35,120
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah.

388
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:35,540
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

389
00:32:35,871 --> 00:32:37,273
[SPEAKER_25]: So I decided to boycott the thread.

390
00:32:37,333 --> 00:32:39,155
[SPEAKER_25]: No, actually I didn't.

391
00:32:39,275 --> 00:32:41,218
[SPEAKER_25]: It's like my soap opera.

392
00:32:41,258 --> 00:32:42,479
[SPEAKER_25]: I've been checking it every day.

393
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:45,843
[SPEAKER_25]: Every day, religiously, like every hour on the hour for updates.

394
00:32:46,164 --> 00:32:47,826
[SPEAKER_02]: Next on As the Arrow Flies.

395
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:51,570
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, as Jamie said earlier in the show, I'm a reality TV whore.

396
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:52,752
[SPEAKER_25]: This is as good as it gets.

397
00:32:53,673 --> 00:32:55,455
[SPEAKER_25]: Which company is going to get voted off the planet?

398
00:32:56,038 --> 00:33:15,778
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the thing that I really liked is that when they were speaking of the cabinet, they pulled up the full schematics of the damn cabinet and outlined each point and how each point is particular specifically to an EDR machine, which is why I think that there wasn't an issue with the pump-it-up machines because they were different enough to bypass EDR.

399
00:33:16,445 --> 00:33:17,245
[SPEAKER_25]: Here's the interesting thing.

400
00:33:17,285 --> 00:33:20,266
[SPEAKER_25]: You've brought up a couple points I really want to emphasize because I feel very similar.

401
00:33:20,406 --> 00:33:27,548
[SPEAKER_25]: A lot of people, when this news first came out, said, STFU, before the documents came out, people were saying, shut the F up.

402
00:33:27,928 --> 00:33:29,828
[SPEAKER_25]: This has nothing to do with the home version.

403
00:33:29,868 --> 00:33:32,869
[SPEAKER_25]: The home version release will not be affected by this.

404
00:33:33,149 --> 00:33:43,391
[SPEAKER_25]: This is strictly about the arcade, and this is only going to affect In the Groove arcade cabinets, and it will have nothing to do with In the Groove 2 because this is all about In the Groove 1.

405
00:33:44,932 --> 00:33:45,432
[SPEAKER_25]: I say wrong.

406
00:33:45,836 --> 00:33:48,718
[SPEAKER_25]: I'd say this has everything to do with the home version.

407
00:33:48,938 --> 00:33:53,180
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they're putting this out right before they're getting the releases done.

408
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,101
[SPEAKER_25]: The timing is crazy.

409
00:33:55,542 --> 00:34:03,546
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, really, at first, the timing of this almost makes it look like Konami has Rockstar by the balls right now, basically, with the In the Groove home release coming out.

410
00:34:03,566 --> 00:34:06,268
[SPEAKER_25]: Poor Red Octane, really, who kind of is caught in the middle of this now.

411
00:34:06,688 --> 00:34:11,311
[SPEAKER_25]: Nowhere named in the lawsuit, but, you know, all this money invested in a last-bush premiere party.

412
00:34:11,691 --> 00:34:11,891
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, yeah.

413
00:34:13,143 --> 00:34:17,345
[SPEAKER_25]: So they've got Rockstar by the balls right now, just before E3 when this is supposed to be unveiled.

414
00:34:18,285 --> 00:34:25,048
[SPEAKER_25]: Obviously, probably what they're trying to do is get this to settle out of court, which I can say with probably 98% certainty will probably happen.

415
00:34:25,528 --> 00:34:27,448
[SPEAKER_25]: I can't honestly see this going to court.

416
00:34:27,749 --> 00:34:32,670
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm wondering, though, with such a small company, Rockstar's basically just getting off the ground.

417
00:34:33,551 --> 00:34:40,794
[SPEAKER_25]: Where are they going to get the kind of money to... They have that other game, Tux Racer or something, but who'd have heard of that before this?

418
00:34:41,254 --> 00:34:41,294
[SPEAKER_25]: No.

419
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:44,346
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, just getting off the ground.

420
00:34:46,608 --> 00:34:54,995
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing, you know, is that they could be sitting on perhaps, you know... And this is speculation.

421
00:34:55,075 --> 00:35:00,359
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been trying to think of all kinds of things that might be the background motive.

422
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:05,603
[SPEAKER_02]: Because basically, Konami of America is pulled out of the arcade market as far as EDR is concerned.

423
00:35:06,044 --> 00:35:07,385
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't necessarily mean...

424
00:35:08,055 --> 00:35:14,400
[SPEAKER_02]: that the powers that be at the main place in Japan might not be thinking, hey, we can market over there too.

425
00:35:16,622 --> 00:35:18,583
[SPEAKER_25]: What do you think about this argument that's coming from a lot?

426
00:35:18,644 --> 00:35:26,670
[SPEAKER_25]: And I'm kind of trying hard not to take sides here because I respect what In The Groove tried to do.

427
00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:34,136
[SPEAKER_25]: It tried to revive a dying arcade dance scene and it was put together by fans.

428
00:35:35,317 --> 00:35:35,517
[SPEAKER_25]: But

429
00:35:36,507 --> 00:35:37,809
[SPEAKER_25]: So I respect the game for that.

430
00:35:37,929 --> 00:35:41,672
[SPEAKER_25]: And even though I've said negative things about the game before, I've also said positive things about the game.

431
00:35:41,692 --> 00:35:44,134
[SPEAKER_25]: And I've always said In the Groove is a great first release.

432
00:35:44,575 --> 00:35:48,298
[SPEAKER_25]: It's not as bad as the haters say, but it's not as good as the people who lavish praise upon it say.

433
00:35:48,318 --> 00:35:50,340
[SPEAKER_25]: There's room for improvement, but they have some great ideas.

434
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:51,621
[SPEAKER_02]: Opinions are opinions.

435
00:35:51,661 --> 00:35:52,241
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, exactly.

436
00:35:52,522 --> 00:35:53,582
[SPEAKER_25]: And I respect what they're doing.

437
00:35:54,243 --> 00:35:56,865
[SPEAKER_25]: But this honestly doesn't come as any surprise to me.

438
00:35:57,106 --> 00:36:03,051
[SPEAKER_25]: I think, unfortunately, I can't say so much about the staff, the folks there.

439
00:36:04,707 --> 00:36:06,528
[SPEAKER_25]: But at least the community has been very arrogant.

440
00:36:08,169 --> 00:36:10,430
[SPEAKER_25]: Very arrogant ever since the release of In the Groove.

441
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:12,871
[SPEAKER_25]: You know, people have asked, is this legal?

442
00:36:13,291 --> 00:36:14,232
[SPEAKER_25]: And people say, yes it is.

443
00:36:14,252 --> 00:36:14,892
[SPEAKER_25]: Shut the fuck up.

444
00:36:14,972 --> 00:36:15,252
[SPEAKER_25]: Lock.

445
00:36:15,412 --> 00:36:16,913
[SPEAKER_02]: That has put me off.

446
00:36:17,549 --> 00:36:33,658
[SPEAKER_25]: much more than the game itself that attitude put me off so bad and that's why I can't help but kind of grin a little bit that this is happening and I'm sorry and I apologize to the folks that have worked so hard on this game but that arrogance that such ass arrogance

447
00:36:34,451 --> 00:36:39,394
[SPEAKER_25]: To see that get called out to the bike racks three o'clock after school is satisfying.

448
00:36:39,734 --> 00:36:44,876
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to be quoted on this on every last single in the groove board that those assholes post on.

449
00:36:45,477 --> 00:36:47,318
[SPEAKER_02]: I fucking term all of you.

450
00:36:47,578 --> 00:36:49,999
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, you're not the only one that told me this would happen.

451
00:36:50,599 --> 00:36:52,700
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, but I have ego, okay?

452
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:53,861
[SPEAKER_02]: I told you!

453
00:36:56,542 --> 00:37:03,948
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can stick your nose up in the air as much as you want to, but it's going to be shaved off by the low-flying airplane that is Konami.

454
00:37:05,029 --> 00:37:06,630
[SPEAKER_25]: We can say I told you so on a million things.

455
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:16,037
[SPEAKER_25]: Now, I know I said, at least a couple months ago on the show, when Red Octane first announced they were going to publish in the groove for home, I said, Konami's going to notice.

456
00:37:16,718 --> 00:37:18,159
[SPEAKER_25]: Didn't I say something like that?

457
00:37:18,179 --> 00:37:21,221
[SPEAKER_25]: I said, if Konami's going to make a move, now's the time.

458
00:37:21,502 --> 00:37:22,903
[SPEAKER_25]: Because in the groove is now...

459
00:37:23,592 --> 00:37:25,153
[SPEAKER_25]: Steppin' on Konami's turf.

460
00:37:25,533 --> 00:37:34,356
[SPEAKER_25]: Konami, obviously, even though people say Konami does shit for their fans, they do shit for DDR, that's a load of crap.

461
00:37:34,636 --> 00:37:43,779
[SPEAKER_25]: When you consider that there are three DDR games, not one, not two, three, more games than we've ever seen at E3 are going to be shown next week.

462
00:37:45,099 --> 00:37:50,721
[SPEAKER_02]: I can name a person who has worked his ass off for all of the US fans of DDR.

463
00:37:51,301 --> 00:37:54,423
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I honestly have to give big kudos to Jason Enos.

464
00:37:54,523 --> 00:37:54,803
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.

465
00:37:54,823 --> 00:38:01,847
[SPEAKER_02]: Without him, we would still be paying, you know, 70 bucks to import the damn game and 80 bucks per dance pad.

466
00:38:02,688 --> 00:38:05,349
[SPEAKER_02]: And instead, now we get unique mixes.

467
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:08,871
[SPEAKER_02]: Japanese players are importing our mixes.

468
00:38:09,272 --> 00:38:09,672
[SPEAKER_25]: Absolutely.

469
00:38:10,012 --> 00:38:11,213
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it's the other way around.

470
00:38:11,293 --> 00:38:18,177
[SPEAKER_25]: And really, Festival, it's some, you know, this is debatable, but Festival in some ways was a copy of Ultramix, which was made here.

471
00:38:18,577 --> 00:38:18,837
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

472
00:38:20,038 --> 00:38:20,298
[SPEAKER_25]: Anyway.

473
00:38:20,863 --> 00:38:22,345
[SPEAKER_02]: Now the market belongs to us.

474
00:38:22,505 --> 00:38:24,348
[SPEAKER_25]: I say bullshit.

475
00:38:24,388 --> 00:38:26,210
[SPEAKER_25]: Konami doesn't care about their American audience.

476
00:38:26,691 --> 00:38:30,616
[SPEAKER_25]: Now, okay, granted you've got the arcade scene, and yes, the arcade scene was hurting.

477
00:38:31,124 --> 00:38:32,285
[SPEAKER_25]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

478
00:38:53,877 --> 00:39:04,007
[SPEAKER_25]: But, somebody phrased it this way on a web board or something, and it does make sense, is that if Konami and Andomero settled out of court, neither one has to say what the terms of that settlement were.

479
00:39:04,468 --> 00:39:09,393
[SPEAKER_25]: Although, I'll tell you what, and so maybe, maybe, maybe that was part of the settlement.

480
00:39:09,853 --> 00:39:10,754
[SPEAKER_25]: But we don't know for sure.

481
00:39:11,715 --> 00:39:17,761
[SPEAKER_25]: And it really, it looks like Konami got the better end of the deal, because if you look at the press release on Konami's site, now granted it's spun by Konami...

482
00:39:18,858 --> 00:39:20,939
[SPEAKER_25]: It says that Andamiro actually ended up paying them.

483
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:25,483
[SPEAKER_25]: So I find it very hard to believe that it's Andamiro keeping Konami out of the U.S.

484
00:39:25,563 --> 00:39:26,224
[SPEAKER_25]: arcade market.

485
00:39:26,304 --> 00:39:27,685
[SPEAKER_25]: I think it's just the fact that the U.S.

486
00:39:27,745 --> 00:39:30,448
[SPEAKER_25]: arcade market kind of stinks right now.

487
00:39:30,828 --> 00:39:33,310
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, on top of that, they closed down their arcade division.

488
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:36,953
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, but they still have put out silent scopes and stuff.

489
00:39:36,993 --> 00:39:40,176
[SPEAKER_25]: If they really wanted to do it, they could, but it would have to be something where

490
00:39:42,234 --> 00:39:43,715
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know, the cost has to be justified.

491
00:39:43,815 --> 00:39:47,037
[SPEAKER_25]: And I've said this on an earlier show, and I still stick by this.

492
00:39:47,517 --> 00:40:04,109
[SPEAKER_25]: I think the reason why you see Xtreme in arcades, and Konami kind of turns its back on it, even though it's not supposed to be in the US, I think the reason why you see it in the arcades is because, hey, licensing music in the US is a whole lot more difficult than it is in Japan.

493
00:40:05,584 --> 00:40:07,205
[SPEAKER_25]: The folks in Japan don't care.

494
00:40:07,265 --> 00:40:16,353
[SPEAKER_25]: You've got all these bands, Captain Jack, for the more recent games, with all the folks on Dance Mania, Wildside, whatever, that would never have been heard in the U.S.

495
00:40:16,393 --> 00:40:17,433
[SPEAKER_25]: if it wasn't for DDR.

496
00:40:17,794 --> 00:40:19,215
[SPEAKER_25]: So none of them care.

497
00:40:19,395 --> 00:40:22,378
[SPEAKER_02]: They had that big agreement with Toshiba EMI.

498
00:40:23,078 --> 00:40:23,859
[SPEAKER_25]: Exactly.

499
00:40:23,959 --> 00:40:31,225
[SPEAKER_25]: And so I think Konami kind of turns its back because it's cheaper to just let folks bring it over here and then make money off the home releases.

500
00:40:33,199 --> 00:40:34,400
[SPEAKER_02]: All that is, is publicity.

501
00:40:34,861 --> 00:40:36,842
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were going to be imported anyway.

502
00:40:36,862 --> 00:40:37,823
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how I see it.

503
00:40:37,903 --> 00:40:40,285
[SPEAKER_25]: That's also a very interesting point you bring up, is about the publicity.

504
00:40:40,325 --> 00:40:47,351
[SPEAKER_25]: Because people say, well if Konami doesn't give a shit about the arcade machines anymore, then why is this such a big deal?

505
00:40:47,732 --> 00:40:49,133
[SPEAKER_25]: Publicity is the big thing.

506
00:40:49,213 --> 00:41:01,123
[SPEAKER_25]: Because if you consider that what Indigroove was in its first release, what Indigroove was, was a conversion kit that would allow you to change a DDR machine into an Indigroove machine.

507
00:41:01,812 --> 00:41:10,975
[SPEAKER_25]: Theoretically, what they would want to do, you have to admit, this is a goal of RockSource in the end, is that they want every DDR machine changed into an in-the-groove machine.

508
00:41:11,095 --> 00:41:15,236
[SPEAKER_25]: Thusly, DDR has no exposure and no presence in the arcades anymore.

509
00:41:15,636 --> 00:41:18,597
[SPEAKER_25]: Thusly, there's no free advertising for the home releases.

510
00:41:19,318 --> 00:41:19,938
[SPEAKER_25]: And you know what?

511
00:41:20,078 --> 00:41:24,139
[SPEAKER_25]: Even though DDR Extreme is two years old, people still play it all the time.

512
00:41:24,179 --> 00:41:26,780
[SPEAKER_25]: It is still huge exposure for Konami.

513
00:41:28,858 --> 00:41:38,827
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, this is the equivalent of saying that you're wearing a t-shirt that advertises one thing.

514
00:41:39,327 --> 00:41:41,970
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the equivalent of Rockstar coming up and spray painting the t-shirt.

515
00:41:41,990 --> 00:41:44,171
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can't see the logo.

516
00:41:45,012 --> 00:41:45,733
[SPEAKER_25]: And a lot of people...

517
00:41:46,178 --> 00:41:47,539
[SPEAKER_25]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

518
00:42:09,949 --> 00:42:13,534
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, I was going to say something about In The Groove and the community and what people say.

519
00:42:13,874 --> 00:42:17,539
[SPEAKER_02]: In The Groove community, you should all pile together and give me a dollar each.

520
00:42:19,581 --> 00:42:20,623
[SPEAKER_25]: Damn, I lost my train of thought.

521
00:42:21,143 --> 00:42:21,544
[SPEAKER_10]: Derail!

522
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:25,481
[SPEAKER_25]: Let's look over some key quotes.

523
00:42:43,035 --> 00:42:55,139
[SPEAKER_25]: Quote, according to instructions provided with Defendants in the game Groove Kits, the purchaser is instructed to remove the original main circuit board from the DDR game and replace it with Defendants in the Groove game circuit board.

524
00:42:55,639 --> 00:42:59,820
[SPEAKER_25]: So that's one of the big things they're hitting on, of course, is the fact that, and people were kind of wondering...

525
00:43:01,863 --> 00:43:04,184
[SPEAKER_25]: How's Konami going to get Rockstar on this?

526
00:43:04,204 --> 00:43:05,584
[SPEAKER_25]: And then it came down to the hardware thing.

527
00:43:05,964 --> 00:43:10,666
[SPEAKER_25]: And I think hardware versus software is a huge issue here.

528
00:43:11,266 --> 00:43:15,648
[SPEAKER_25]: Because I know we had the in-the-groove scene always going, it's legal, it's legal, it's legal.

529
00:43:16,308 --> 00:43:20,749
[SPEAKER_25]: Unfortunately, I think they were more concerned with the software end of it.

530
00:43:21,529 --> 00:43:25,771
[SPEAKER_25]: And the software part of it probably is legal, because you'd barely see it mentioned in the lawsuit.

531
00:43:25,811 --> 00:43:27,812
[SPEAKER_25]: But the hardware part of it... Whoops.

532
00:43:28,812 --> 00:43:28,972
[SPEAKER_25]: So...

533
00:43:29,605 --> 00:43:30,206
[SPEAKER_25]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

534
00:43:43,593 --> 00:43:52,357
[SPEAKER_25]: Defendant provides materials bearing its own name and or trademarks to purchasers of the In the Groove game to be placed over the plaintiff's marks and other identifying material on the DDR game.

535
00:43:52,797 --> 00:43:58,520
[SPEAKER_25]: On information and belief, purchasers fail to cover plaintiff's marks and or other identifying material in all instances.

536
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:05,803
[SPEAKER_25]: The In the Groove game, as refitted by purchasers, therefore displays both plaintiff's marks and defendant's name and or trademarks.

537
00:44:07,284 --> 00:44:10,005
[SPEAKER_25]: And a lot of people say in the scene here, they say...

538
00:44:11,889 --> 00:44:14,390
[SPEAKER_25]: How can you confuse DDR and In The Groove?

539
00:44:14,470 --> 00:44:15,530
[SPEAKER_25]: They're so different.

540
00:44:16,090 --> 00:44:19,151
[SPEAKER_25]: And to which I say, it's not all about you.

541
00:44:20,971 --> 00:44:22,671
[SPEAKER_25]: We are a small part.

542
00:44:22,771 --> 00:44:23,912
[SPEAKER_25]: We're a loyal part.

543
00:44:23,952 --> 00:44:24,952
[SPEAKER_25]: We're an essential part.

544
00:44:24,992 --> 00:44:28,233
[SPEAKER_25]: But we're a small part of the dance game music scene.

545
00:44:28,273 --> 00:44:28,893
[SPEAKER_25]: We really are.

546
00:44:30,213 --> 00:44:36,674
[SPEAKER_25]: As I was talking about last week, when we were talking about Oops I Did It Again being on DDR Extreme 2, the reason why that's there is not for you.

547
00:44:36,714 --> 00:44:38,915
[SPEAKER_25]: It's for the 10-year-old girls having slumber parties.

548
00:44:39,475 --> 00:44:39,675
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

549
00:44:40,712 --> 00:44:50,074
[SPEAKER_25]: So it is the normal person who is having a birthday party in an arcade that doesn't know the difference any better between one machine to another does think that that game is DDR.

550
00:44:50,394 --> 00:44:58,916
[SPEAKER_25]: Case in point, you might remember that our very own Loki, and, you know, even though this was questionable, whatever, actually installed, like, a Stepmania thing in a cabinet.

551
00:44:59,396 --> 00:44:59,596
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

552
00:44:59,816 --> 00:45:06,358
[SPEAKER_25]: Now, he didn't make money off of it, which is probably why, you know, everything, you know, and it was only one machine, so, you know, everything...

553
00:45:07,210 --> 00:45:32,313
[SPEAKER_25]: Whatever, and it's gone now, so it doesn't matter But he installed Stepmania, and it was re-skinned And it had the mines, because it was the newer version of Stepmania It was different, and he put it up and running And we all went to Roseville Golf Land one day to check it out And I overheard some girl that just looked like she was there She said to some person that was there, yeah, this is the new DDR, let's go play it It wasn't the new DDR, it looked like DDR though

554
00:45:34,013 --> 00:45:38,836
[SPEAKER_25]: and it had DDR written on the machine still because they had been too lazy to put the new marquee up.

555
00:45:39,337 --> 00:45:50,124
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know the other thing that I was thinking that Konami needs to really watch out for is the acronym DDR and Dance Dance Revolution becoming a generic term.

556
00:45:52,385 --> 00:46:02,832
[SPEAKER_02]: In the 80s, I'm going to use this as an example, Xerox released an ad that said something to the effect of Xerox is not a generic term

557
00:46:03,644 --> 00:46:07,567
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure that you're only using Xerox products when you say, I'm going to Xerox something.

558
00:46:07,747 --> 00:46:11,811
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if someone says, I'm going to Xerox something, they're thinking, oh, you're just going to go over to the copy machine, right?

559
00:46:12,792 --> 00:46:13,152
[SPEAKER_10]: Right, right.

560
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:20,558
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, the term refrigerator was actually a brand name, and now it's a generic term.

561
00:46:22,139 --> 00:46:25,522
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Frigidaire, that actually has become a household generic.

562
00:46:27,784 --> 00:46:31,007
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just all, you know, Weedeater, that's now a generic.

563
00:46:31,587 --> 00:46:32,408
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we...

564
00:46:33,052 --> 00:46:38,036
[SPEAKER_02]: Think of our dancing games, and the first thing that we all think of now is DDR.

565
00:46:39,517 --> 00:46:49,645
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that what it is, another point is that they may not want the average player to confuse in the group with DDR, to have it become a generic.

566
00:46:49,905 --> 00:46:54,009
[SPEAKER_25]: That's a very interesting point, and I don't think I've seen that point brought up anywhere yet.

567
00:46:54,129 --> 00:46:55,150
[SPEAKER_25]: That's very interesting.

568
00:46:56,190 --> 00:46:56,471
[SPEAKER_02]: Because...

569
00:46:58,620 --> 00:47:04,363
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, there were quite a few lawsuits concerning generics that people have actually lost.

570
00:47:04,503 --> 00:47:04,764
[SPEAKER_25]: Very good.

571
00:47:05,184 --> 00:47:09,306
[SPEAKER_25]: Oreo, Kleenex, Band-Aid, Aspirin, Coke, Trojan.

572
00:47:10,967 --> 00:47:12,708
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know about Trojan, but the rest of them work.

573
00:47:12,728 --> 00:47:13,588
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you guys in chat.

574
00:47:14,169 --> 00:47:18,331
[SPEAKER_02]: Aspirin was, that's correct, I think, cicatrice, aspirin was a trademark before World War II.

575
00:47:19,051 --> 00:47:24,854
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, okay, another one, you know, Motrin.

576
00:47:26,315 --> 00:47:27,656
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we think of that for ibuprofen.

577
00:47:30,383 --> 00:47:56,473
[SPEAKER_02]: so many things that we consider they were individual brandings before DDR is easily going on that path because we think what's the first thing that you're going to think of when someone starts naming off different dancing games the average person is going to go back and think DDR because that is where it all came from

578
00:47:57,065 --> 00:47:57,926
[SPEAKER_25]: NeonFM NeonFM

579
00:48:23,337 --> 00:48:24,579
[SPEAKER_25]: It's like comparing Sonic to Mario.

580
00:48:24,599 --> 00:48:24,639
[SPEAKER_25]: Uh...

581
00:48:39,076 --> 00:48:39,656
[SPEAKER_25]: And I'm like, no.

582
00:48:39,716 --> 00:48:40,616
[SPEAKER_25]: I beg to differ.

583
00:48:40,696 --> 00:48:43,797
[SPEAKER_25]: This is like comparing Mario to Gianna Sisters.

584
00:48:44,198 --> 00:48:51,200
[SPEAKER_25]: And for those of you that don't know what Gianna Sisters was, it was a game that came out on the Commodore 64 in, I think, 88 or so, a couple years after Mario was out.

585
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:55,941
[SPEAKER_25]: And it was very much like Mario, except they changed it to girls.

586
00:48:56,321 --> 00:48:57,061
[SPEAKER_25]: But this is the thing.

587
00:48:57,382 --> 00:48:58,722
[SPEAKER_25]: This is the irony.

588
00:48:59,282 --> 00:49:01,543
[SPEAKER_25]: The music was better in Gianna Sisters.

589
00:49:01,903 --> 00:49:12,085
[SPEAKER_25]: Gianna Sisters had slightly new elements, but it still had things that looked like Goombas, and still had things that looked like Turtles, and you still got mushroom-like power-ups.

590
00:49:13,105 --> 00:49:14,925
[SPEAKER_25]: Gianna Sisters lost and got pulled from the market.

591
00:49:15,665 --> 00:49:18,766
[SPEAKER_02]: Another point, Pac-Man and Casey Crazy Chase.

592
00:49:19,146 --> 00:49:19,866
[SPEAKER_25]: Or Casey Munchkin.

593
00:49:19,886 --> 00:49:21,427
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it was Casey Crazy Chase.

594
00:49:21,447 --> 00:49:22,367
[SPEAKER_25]: I thought it was Casey Munchkin.

595
00:49:23,907 --> 00:49:28,768
[SPEAKER_02]: For people who don't know, there was a system that came out in the early 80s called the Odyssey 2, which I own one,

596
00:49:29,623 --> 00:49:30,644
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have a TV to play it.

597
00:49:31,044 --> 00:49:33,425
[SPEAKER_02]: But there was a game that came out called Casey Crazy Chase.

598
00:49:34,186 --> 00:49:36,507
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically it was freaking Pac-Man.

599
00:49:37,288 --> 00:49:43,071
[SPEAKER_02]: Just, you know, really crappy graphics because they didn't have a way to do graphics exactly the same as they were in the arcade.

600
00:49:43,591 --> 00:49:45,612
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, not like today where home games are better.

601
00:49:46,653 --> 00:49:53,357
[SPEAKER_02]: But still, you know, now they actually pulled a bunch of copies and destroyed them.

602
00:49:53,996 --> 00:50:10,554
[SPEAKER_02]: so that's why if you happen to see an Odyssey 2 cartridge for KC Crazy Chase I suggest you buy it because that would be holding a piece of gaming rarity right there very interesting one of the resolution pieces that Konami wants is they want these things destroyed yep

603
00:50:11,553 --> 00:50:14,855
[SPEAKER_25]: So if in the groove home version comes out, buy it right away.

604
00:50:14,995 --> 00:50:17,576
[SPEAKER_25]: No matter how you feel about the game, buy it right away because it could.

605
00:50:18,436 --> 00:50:24,159
[SPEAKER_25]: We don't know how this is going to affect the home version, but I do want to point this out because a lot of people are saying this is not going to affect the release of the home version.

606
00:50:24,799 --> 00:50:25,580
[SPEAKER_25]: I beg to differ.

607
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:27,921
[SPEAKER_25]: I think this thing is going to get delayed if nothing else.

608
00:50:28,061 --> 00:50:28,781
[SPEAKER_25]: I could be wrong.

609
00:50:29,201 --> 00:50:34,564
[SPEAKER_25]: Granted, as somebody pointed out to me this week when I had a really big ego and I was like, I called this, I called this.

610
00:50:34,824 --> 00:50:36,985
[SPEAKER_25]: When they released the home version, they were going to get sued.

611
00:50:37,958 --> 00:50:41,922
[SPEAKER_25]: Somebody said, Rob, you also said that in the Groove Home version was No Way in Hell ever coming out.

612
00:50:41,942 --> 00:50:43,723
[SPEAKER_25]: I was like, okay, good point.

613
00:50:44,924 --> 00:50:50,749
[SPEAKER_25]: So if this does come out, it would be interesting, but I could almost say with certainty this has to get delayed, at least.

614
00:50:51,009 --> 00:50:54,833
[SPEAKER_25]: Red Octane has got to be scared a little bit right now, or at least waiting to see what comes next.

615
00:50:55,373 --> 00:51:02,479
[SPEAKER_02]: If anybody is, I actually would love to get a statement, an official statement from the folks at Rockstar.

616
00:51:02,499 --> 00:51:02,860
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't we all?

617
00:51:03,756 --> 00:51:10,842
[SPEAKER_25]: The official statement, if you go into the Indigroove forums right now, is a locked thread where somebody said, what's with this lawsuit?

618
00:51:10,863 --> 00:51:17,909
[SPEAKER_25]: And somebody basically said, we have no comment at this time, we are not discussing legal issues on this forum, all further posts on this will be deleted.

619
00:51:18,149 --> 00:51:19,090
[SPEAKER_25]: Not locked, deleted.

620
00:51:19,870 --> 00:51:21,652
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm paraphrasing there, that's not the exact quote.

621
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:28,663
[SPEAKER_02]: Then apparently their attorney has called for silence prior to... Well, probably they don't know what to do.

622
00:51:28,843 --> 00:51:35,165
[SPEAKER_25]: Remember, the folks that worked on this game... Now, granted, Rockstar Games has been in this a little while before, but with what?

623
00:51:35,205 --> 00:51:36,806
[SPEAKER_25]: They're a small-scale company.

624
00:51:37,146 --> 00:51:41,047
[SPEAKER_25]: The folks that made In the Groove were DDR fans to begin with.

625
00:51:41,527 --> 00:51:43,528
[SPEAKER_25]: They don't know what the hell they've gotten themselves into.

626
00:51:43,548 --> 00:51:45,549
[SPEAKER_02]: This has kind of got to be a slap in the face to them, too.

627
00:51:45,949 --> 00:51:49,230
[SPEAKER_25]: They'll never play DDR again, granted, I would assume.

628
00:51:49,310 --> 00:51:50,391
[SPEAKER_25]: But at the same time...

629
00:51:51,385 --> 00:51:52,366
[SPEAKER_25]: You're paying for that arrogance.

630
00:51:52,446 --> 00:51:52,886
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm sorry.

631
00:51:54,587 --> 00:51:57,510
[SPEAKER_25]: Maybe not necessarily the staff, but you didn't discipline the scene.

632
00:51:57,650 --> 00:52:03,134
[SPEAKER_25]: And the scene has been incredibly arrogant with this whole thing.

633
00:52:03,194 --> 00:52:04,595
[SPEAKER_02]: We do a little radio station.

634
00:52:04,755 --> 00:52:09,298
[SPEAKER_02]: How much research did I put in to see if Originals was copyrighted in the States?

635
00:52:10,699 --> 00:52:14,002
[SPEAKER_02]: I did the research for our name.

636
00:52:14,202 --> 00:52:19,786
[SPEAKER_02]: How are they going to get away with not doing any research prior to making the product?

637
00:52:20,376 --> 00:52:22,157
[SPEAKER_02]: That is just good business.

638
00:52:22,317 --> 00:52:24,137
[SPEAKER_25]: Konami also knows about us and they don't care.

639
00:52:24,638 --> 00:52:26,678
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but we also do good things for Konami.

640
00:52:26,699 --> 00:52:27,099
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, we do.

641
00:52:27,459 --> 00:52:27,639
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

642
00:52:28,519 --> 00:52:32,061
[SPEAKER_25]: But... You know, we talk about them negatively sometimes, but it's fair.

643
00:52:32,201 --> 00:52:33,641
[SPEAKER_25]: Everything's fair, I think, and we do.

644
00:52:33,881 --> 00:52:35,282
[SPEAKER_25]: We try to bring you both sides of the story.

645
00:52:35,722 --> 00:52:36,082
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

646
00:52:36,822 --> 00:52:43,245
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, but on top of that, how could they have not, you know, a little bit of homework?

647
00:52:44,586 --> 00:52:46,886
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it shouldn't have even required the homework.

648
00:52:47,127 --> 00:52:48,227
[SPEAKER_02]: They should have known.

649
00:52:49,096 --> 00:52:54,380
[SPEAKER_02]: There were patents out and copyrights not just for the game itself, you know, for content.

650
00:52:54,740 --> 00:52:55,861
[SPEAKER_02]: There was for concept.

651
00:52:56,101 --> 00:52:57,322
[SPEAKER_02]: There was for the hardware.

652
00:52:57,382 --> 00:52:59,903
[SPEAKER_02]: There was for everything else involved with it, marketing.

653
00:52:59,943 --> 00:53:04,767
[SPEAKER_25]: The weird thing is, is there was this giant assumption in the scene that Andamiro held that patent.

654
00:53:05,127 --> 00:53:09,290
[SPEAKER_25]: But that was proven wrong when Cutress posted those documents that clearly show a U.S.

655
00:53:09,350 --> 00:53:13,653
[SPEAKER_25]: patent for the machine, the sensors, the screen, even though the screen looked a little different.

656
00:53:14,193 --> 00:53:15,194
[SPEAKER_25]: Everything has a U.S.

657
00:53:15,254 --> 00:53:17,355
[SPEAKER_25]: patent by Konami, not Andamiro, Konami.

658
00:53:17,896 --> 00:53:17,996
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

659
00:53:18,016 --> 00:53:18,296
[SPEAKER_25]: Oops.

660
00:53:19,793 --> 00:53:24,095
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, no, you know, and if they had done their homework, they would have found that out.

661
00:53:24,675 --> 00:53:32,257
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually, there are online patent registries where they would actually have the name, the hardware, everything, you can find that all online.

662
00:53:32,918 --> 00:53:35,559
[SPEAKER_02]: For the, what's the patent office?

663
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:43,161
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to think what the... What handles, I'll find it out later.

664
00:53:43,461 --> 00:53:44,482
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll see if I can't get it online.

665
00:53:46,422 --> 00:53:47,923
[SPEAKER_02]: It would have just taken, you know,

666
00:53:49,161 --> 00:53:50,962
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no mercy to people who do stupid stuff.

667
00:54:16,982 --> 00:54:17,803
[SPEAKER_25]: It's their first time.

668
00:54:18,324 --> 00:54:19,585
[SPEAKER_25]: This whole thing, think about it.

669
00:54:19,925 --> 00:54:27,412
[SPEAKER_25]: You've created this game from the ground up and suddenly somebody wants to buy it, put it in arcades, release it on the PS2, all in the scope of a year.

670
00:54:28,073 --> 00:54:30,575
[SPEAKER_25]: Heads are spinning at the folks who created this game right now.

671
00:54:30,855 --> 00:54:32,417
[SPEAKER_25]: You know, we all make dumb mistakes.

672
00:54:34,338 --> 00:54:36,120
[SPEAKER_02]: I still don't think it's excusable.

673
00:54:37,813 --> 00:54:40,794
[SPEAKER_02]: On top of that, this lawsuit would be on Red Octane's head.

674
00:54:41,394 --> 00:54:42,555
[SPEAKER_02]: Red Octane should have known better.

675
00:54:43,215 --> 00:54:44,556
[SPEAKER_02]: They should have known better.

676
00:54:44,956 --> 00:54:53,480
[SPEAKER_02]: Seeing as how they market the actual physical dance pads, the games, they should have known.

677
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:54,801
[SPEAKER_02]: But software versus hardware.

678
00:54:55,461 --> 00:54:58,803
[SPEAKER_25]: The lawsuit's not really about... It is and it isn't about the software.

679
00:54:58,823 --> 00:55:03,946
[SPEAKER_25]: The lawsuit's specifically not about the software, but I say it's being done in response to the software.

680
00:55:04,286 --> 00:55:06,407
[SPEAKER_25]: So I think Red Octane probably...

681
00:55:07,099 --> 00:55:08,020
[SPEAKER_25]: And they're probably right.

682
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:12,903
[SPEAKER_25]: Had the hardware not been all screwy the way that In the Groove became in arcades, it probably would have been okay.

683
00:55:13,724 --> 00:55:14,424
[SPEAKER_25]: So I can't fault them.

684
00:55:14,444 --> 00:55:21,370
[SPEAKER_02]: The only way that they're going to get around at least any future arcade releases, sorry, they're going to have to build themselves a new cabinet and change their interface.

685
00:55:22,430 --> 00:55:22,651
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay.

686
00:55:23,131 --> 00:55:24,732
[SPEAKER_25]: Our chat room is saying shut up already.

687
00:55:24,772 --> 00:55:25,653
[SPEAKER_25]: We're getting confused.

688
00:55:25,673 --> 00:55:27,514
[SPEAKER_25]: There's too much chat going on.

689
00:55:27,554 --> 00:55:27,814
[SPEAKER_25]: All right.

690
00:55:28,255 --> 00:55:29,456
[SPEAKER_25]: Get over it first off.

691
00:55:29,876 --> 00:55:32,318
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, so what happens next?

692
00:55:32,438 --> 00:55:33,198
[SPEAKER_25]: What do you think?

693
00:55:33,258 --> 00:55:35,460
[SPEAKER_25]: What's your predicted resolution of what will happen?

694
00:55:38,188 --> 00:55:39,209
[SPEAKER_02]: The injunction is going to stay.

695
00:55:40,569 --> 00:55:45,212
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is how ideally it should go.

696
00:55:45,752 --> 00:55:50,195
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm thinking, I'm going to do this from the Konami standpoint, and then I'm going to do it from the Roxborough standpoint.

697
00:55:50,936 --> 00:55:54,578
[SPEAKER_02]: Ideally for Konami, the home release of In the Groove will not happen.

698
00:55:55,278 --> 00:56:01,422
[SPEAKER_02]: The injunction will stay, because part of this injunction right now is to protect their interest before there is a court case.

699
00:56:02,802 --> 00:56:03,903
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to cease production.

700
00:56:04,924 --> 00:56:05,144
[SPEAKER_02]: Now,

701
00:56:06,184 --> 00:56:11,227
[SPEAKER_02]: I also think that they are going to have to pay X amount of dollar for every in-the-groove kit sold.

702
00:56:13,148 --> 00:56:18,111
[SPEAKER_02]: And they can actually assess punitive damages as well.

703
00:56:18,992 --> 00:56:21,293
[SPEAKER_02]: Which are basically like being spanked.

704
00:56:21,934 --> 00:56:23,635
[SPEAKER_02]: You did a bad thing, we're going to spank you now.

705
00:56:24,695 --> 00:56:30,679
[SPEAKER_02]: They also have the right to assess profits lost.

706
00:56:32,899 --> 00:56:36,102
[SPEAKER_02]: As in any, because these are full Japanese machines.

707
00:56:36,522 --> 00:56:37,943
[SPEAKER_02]: Konami of Japan has lost money.

708
00:56:40,165 --> 00:56:42,567
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's essentially how it is, because these machines have to be paid for.

709
00:56:42,787 --> 00:56:46,590
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, but these machines aren't supposed to be, quote unquote, in the U.S., so what happens there?

710
00:56:46,610 --> 00:56:47,471
[SPEAKER_25]: That's kind of a gray area.

711
00:56:47,691 --> 00:56:48,992
[SPEAKER_25]: Could be Rockstar Saving Grace, too.

712
00:56:49,012 --> 00:56:56,018
[SPEAKER_02]: That could be, but also, again, as these machines are publicity, that may have cost them in sales of the home versions.

713
00:56:56,940 --> 00:56:58,161
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

714
00:57:25,803 --> 00:57:29,446
[SPEAKER_02]: and again, I'm thinking from a legal standpoint, this might be what they can get away with.

715
00:57:30,527 --> 00:57:36,011
[SPEAKER_02]: The software may be permissible, given that it was built from the ground up.

716
00:57:37,232 --> 00:57:52,223
[SPEAKER_02]: This also has to do with a little bit of trade secret, but it would have to be proven through some type of reverse engineering that the home software is not a complete duplicate of

717
00:57:52,834 --> 00:57:54,275
[SPEAKER_02]: of DDR.

718
00:57:54,896 --> 00:57:57,118
[SPEAKER_02]: If they pull that off, the home release will still happen.

719
00:57:58,159 --> 00:58:01,222
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, they're not going to make it out with the hardware issue.

720
00:58:01,922 --> 00:58:05,366
[SPEAKER_02]: They, I think, can get away with releasing future editions.

721
00:58:05,906 --> 00:58:14,294
[SPEAKER_02]: They are going to have to create a unique cabinet and the boards and sell them as a joint unit, the way that Pump It Up goes.

722
00:58:16,337 --> 00:58:19,580
[SPEAKER_25]: Any future releases will have to continue to use that platform only and be upgrades for that unit only.

723
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:22,182
[SPEAKER_25]: That is the only way that they're going to be able to continue to release any arcade releases.

724
00:58:38,675 --> 00:58:40,836
[SPEAKER_02]: For the first one, I'm sorry, they're fucked.

725
00:58:41,996 --> 00:58:42,756
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to have to pay.

726
00:58:44,117 --> 00:58:45,717
[SPEAKER_02]: And this could ruin them.

727
00:58:46,198 --> 00:58:48,558
[SPEAKER_02]: This seriously could financially ruin them.

728
00:58:49,559 --> 00:58:53,640
[SPEAKER_02]: This could also, however, put them in a more public light.

729
00:58:55,681 --> 00:58:58,042
[SPEAKER_02]: A negative event can turn into positive publicity.

730
00:58:58,082 --> 00:59:01,743
[SPEAKER_25]: That is a very interesting side point is that a negative event can be publicity.

731
00:59:01,803 --> 00:59:04,364
[SPEAKER_25]: This whole thing could be publicity for them.

732
00:59:04,444 --> 00:59:07,545
[SPEAKER_25]: Although, when you look out on the big gaming websites, it's not...

733
00:59:08,519 --> 00:59:09,219
[SPEAKER_25]: That huge deal.

734
00:59:09,239 --> 00:59:13,020
[SPEAKER_25]: I think most game sites ran a little side story on it, but no major things.

735
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:26,924
[SPEAKER_02]: So if they are permitted to release the home version, if they are permitted to go through within the group too, with this little bit of controversy going on... Example, Madonna's sex book.

736
00:59:27,984 --> 00:59:28,244
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay?

737
00:59:29,491 --> 00:59:30,812
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the first thing that came to my mind.

738
00:59:30,912 --> 00:59:31,172
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay.

739
00:59:31,552 --> 00:59:32,992
[SPEAKER_02]: The book was banned.

740
00:59:33,032 --> 00:59:33,793
[SPEAKER_02]: She was sued.

741
00:59:34,213 --> 00:59:34,933
[SPEAKER_02]: All this crap.

742
00:59:35,373 --> 00:59:37,554
[SPEAKER_02]: And how popular did that make her?

743
00:59:37,674 --> 00:59:37,974
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

744
00:59:38,175 --> 00:59:38,415
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, yeah.

745
00:59:38,455 --> 00:59:38,715
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

746
00:59:39,815 --> 00:59:41,876
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to compare the groove to Madonna.

747
00:59:41,916 --> 00:59:43,137
[SPEAKER_02]: That was cool.

748
00:59:43,157 --> 00:59:43,957
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is funny.

749
00:59:44,457 --> 00:59:47,018
[SPEAKER_25]: Get into the groove, boy, you've got to prove.

750
00:59:47,058 --> 00:59:48,199
[SPEAKER_25]: I still think of that song every time I see it.

751
00:59:48,219 --> 00:59:49,719
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that song is public domain now.

752
00:59:50,419 --> 00:59:50,660
[SPEAKER_25]: Maybe.

753
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:50,980
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know.

754
00:59:52,567 --> 00:59:54,948
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm kind of similar to your thoughts on this.

755
00:59:56,548 --> 01:00:06,110
[SPEAKER_25]: Because I think this lawsuit is a direct response to the home release, I think that the home release, and I could be wrong, I think the home release will be affected.

756
01:00:06,210 --> 01:00:08,130
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't think this is going to go to court.

757
01:00:08,150 --> 01:00:09,631
[SPEAKER_25]: I think Rockstar and Konami are going to settle.

758
01:00:10,051 --> 01:00:15,132
[SPEAKER_25]: And I think as part of the terms, they're going to recall, but I doubt any of them will be recalled, really.

759
01:00:15,152 --> 01:00:17,552
[SPEAKER_25]: They're going to recall the box or kits or whatever.

760
01:00:18,092 --> 01:00:21,333
[SPEAKER_25]: I think that In The Groove will be stopped.

761
01:00:22,014 --> 01:00:50,864
[SPEAKER_25]: or delayed heavily and Konami will be given a chunk of the profit from the game and I think also as part of it I bet you anything they're going to have to settle where they can't really market the game it's going to have to come out quietly but who knows I might just be thinking crazy but I think that's probably what's going to happen I think though this is my other crazy prediction now tape me in case I'm right I think In The Groove 2 will still come out in arcades under a new name I don't think it'll be called In The Groove 2 anymore

762
01:00:51,087 --> 01:00:52,327
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also the other thing.

763
01:00:53,328 --> 01:00:57,869
[SPEAKER_02]: Konami could obtain any rights to the In the Groove franchise.

764
01:00:59,169 --> 01:00:59,810
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also that.

765
01:01:00,110 --> 01:01:00,450
[SPEAKER_20]: We'll see.

766
01:01:01,910 --> 01:01:07,032
[SPEAKER_02]: And therefore, again, receive a percentage of the profits.

767
01:01:09,933 --> 01:01:10,213
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright.

768
01:01:11,073 --> 01:01:11,373
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm done.

769
01:01:11,613 --> 01:01:13,354
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't want to talk about the lawsuit right now anymore.

770
01:01:13,374 --> 01:01:14,714
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm done with my side of the story.

771
01:01:15,534 --> 01:01:17,655
[SPEAKER_25]: Honestly, when all is said and done, I just...

772
01:01:18,653 --> 01:01:20,295
[SPEAKER_25]: Let the courts figure it out.

773
01:01:20,315 --> 01:01:22,157
[SPEAKER_25]: We're all trying to be lawyers right now.

774
01:01:22,317 --> 01:01:28,483
[SPEAKER_25]: The truth is, we don't really know everything going on because we're not behind the closed doors right now.

775
01:01:28,543 --> 01:01:31,746
[SPEAKER_25]: We don't know what Rakshasa's side of the case is, so we can't really make judgments.

776
01:01:32,266 --> 01:01:35,089
[SPEAKER_25]: But I want to kind of close this segment with this thought.

777
01:01:36,130 --> 01:01:39,933
[SPEAKER_25]: Those of you guys that are saying boycott Konami over this, shut the fuck up.

778
01:01:40,314 --> 01:01:40,754
[SPEAKER_25]: Seriously.

779
01:01:41,095 --> 01:01:43,477
[SPEAKER_25]: There would have been no In The Groove if it wasn't for DDR.

780
01:01:44,187 --> 01:01:46,209
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, that is a case in point.

781
01:01:46,330 --> 01:01:48,712
[SPEAKER_25]: Absolutely, they would never have been in the group if it wasn't for DDR.

782
01:01:49,714 --> 01:01:52,156
[SPEAKER_25]: Konami has not abandoned their US audience.

783
01:01:52,417 --> 01:01:53,598
[SPEAKER_25]: Konami of Japan?

784
01:01:54,059 --> 01:01:54,659
[SPEAKER_25]: Eh, maybe.

785
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:55,340
[SPEAKER_25]: But you know what?

786
01:01:55,360 --> 01:02:00,266
[SPEAKER_25]: People in Konami of America are working their ass off to bring you three new games at E3 this year.

787
01:02:01,610 --> 01:02:02,450
[SPEAKER_25]: Seriously, shut up.

788
01:02:02,911 --> 01:02:04,651
[SPEAKER_25]: Boycotting Konami is not going to do anything.

789
01:02:05,452 --> 01:02:07,213
[SPEAKER_25]: Honestly, go ahead and boycott.

790
01:02:07,233 --> 01:02:07,953
[SPEAKER_25]: Get off my machine.

791
01:02:09,193 --> 01:02:13,415
[SPEAKER_02]: The five of you who would be boycotting this, you're not going to make a dent.

792
01:02:13,575 --> 01:02:14,696
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, it's not going to work.

793
01:02:14,896 --> 01:02:15,296
[SPEAKER_25]: Go ahead.

794
01:02:15,736 --> 01:02:17,137
[SPEAKER_25]: We're probably just adding fuel to their fire.

795
01:02:17,217 --> 01:02:17,657
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't care.

796
01:02:17,677 --> 01:02:19,718
[SPEAKER_25]: You're a little boycott.

797
01:02:19,738 --> 01:02:22,219
[SPEAKER_25]: You have no respect for where you got your game from.

798
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:25,921
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if they do some stupid little boycott...

799
01:02:26,684 --> 01:02:28,466
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just going to open the door.

800
01:02:30,007 --> 01:02:31,748
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, well, I need to see what this is.

801
01:02:32,709 --> 01:02:33,290
[SPEAKER_02]: You're helping.

802
01:02:33,770 --> 01:02:34,151
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

803
01:02:35,111 --> 01:02:40,016
[SPEAKER_25]: You know, honestly, if you want to make a point, get the hell off the DDR boards and start one for In the Groove 2.

804
01:02:40,056 --> 01:02:43,619
[SPEAKER_25]: Because I think In the Groove 2 will happen under a new name.

805
01:02:43,739 --> 01:02:46,061
[SPEAKER_25]: So go figure that one out.

806
01:02:46,221 --> 01:02:47,562
[SPEAKER_03]: You should go back to Spider Stomp.

807
01:02:48,503 --> 01:02:50,224
[SPEAKER_03]: Get out your power pad, play some Dance Aerobics.

808
01:02:51,325 --> 01:02:52,546
[SPEAKER_25]: We'll be back after this break.

809
01:02:52,666 --> 01:02:54,428
[SPEAKER_25]: Your calls on this whole thing.

810
01:02:55,356 --> 01:02:57,544
[SPEAKER_25]: Your calls on the whole thing when we come back after this.

811
01:03:55,345 --> 01:03:59,509
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

812
01:04:25,656 --> 01:04:26,259
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks for watching!

813
01:06:13,705 --> 01:06:14,247
DarkSakura

814
01:07:51,732 --> 01:07:53,097
Thanks for watching!

815
01:09:28,564 --> 01:09:29,804
Thanks for watching!

816
01:10:03,857 --> 01:10:05,337
Thanks for watching!

817
01:11:21,238 --> 01:11:23,359
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

818
01:11:47,722 --> 01:11:48,262
[SPEAKER_25]: TAC ElectroTunes

819
01:12:06,291 --> 01:12:07,612
[SPEAKER_25]: Whatever, TakuTak, same to me.

820
01:12:07,912 --> 01:12:09,433
[SPEAKER_25]: Rio and StarMind, sorry that's it off.

821
01:12:09,773 --> 01:12:12,635
[SPEAKER_25]: We're going to go right into taking calls on the Skype line.

822
01:12:12,675 --> 01:12:20,419
[SPEAKER_25]: If you want more information, www.OrangeLoungeRadio.com Click on Interact With Us and get the more information on the Skype line.

823
01:12:20,819 --> 01:12:21,580
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes, DarkSakura?

824
01:12:22,740 --> 01:12:26,022
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I'm just marveling at how delicious this black cherry soda is.

825
01:12:26,182 --> 01:12:27,463
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright, let's get to our first call.

826
01:12:27,503 --> 01:12:29,404
[SPEAKER_25]: Hello, caller, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

827
01:12:30,905 --> 01:12:31,165
[SPEAKER_25]: Boo.

828
01:12:31,805 --> 01:12:32,906
[SPEAKER_25]: Boo, who's this?

829
01:12:35,089 --> 01:12:36,430
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, don't play dumb, Rob.

830
01:12:36,470 --> 01:12:36,910
[SPEAKER_25]: Come on.

831
01:12:36,950 --> 01:12:37,670
[SPEAKER_25]: Not too bad.

832
01:12:37,730 --> 01:12:38,751
[SPEAKER_25]: How about you?

833
01:12:56,256 --> 01:13:00,619
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, my brain has been broken and repaired several times trying to go through that thread.

834
01:13:01,099 --> 01:13:06,583
[SPEAKER_21]: I've sworn off posting it a couple of times and then ended up having to come back to correct people yet again.

835
01:13:07,544 --> 01:13:10,005
[SPEAKER_25]: How many warning points would you say you've given out in that thread?

836
01:13:11,366 --> 01:13:21,392
[SPEAKER_21]: Actually, I think I've only dished out two different warnings and one of them somebody is complaining about incessantly because he says that it wasn't merited at all.

837
01:13:22,093 --> 01:13:25,335
[SPEAKER_21]: He said that basically the reason the lawsuit existed was

838
01:13:25,845 --> 01:13:34,847
[SPEAKER_21]: was that they were about to put out a new arcade version and that he saw something about it in a California arcade, somebody showing him pictures on a laptop.

839
01:13:34,947 --> 01:13:38,468
[SPEAKER_21]: And I'm just like, how exactly do you think that's legitimate?

840
01:13:39,148 --> 01:13:40,248
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, that's a little weird.

841
01:13:40,468 --> 01:13:54,791
[SPEAKER_25]: Or it kind of goes back to, and somebody had called in, I don't remember if it was last week or the week before, talking about somebody had posted in their live journal that, I don't know, their uncle's sister's brother had posted something about the new machine is coming out for sure this year.

842
01:13:55,991 --> 01:13:57,092
[SPEAKER_21]: I think that was Cucumber.

843
01:13:57,132 --> 01:14:00,455
[SPEAKER_21]: I think he said they were gearing up for a location test in September.

844
01:14:00,715 --> 01:14:05,719
[SPEAKER_25]: No offense against the dude, but I mean, why should I believe him?

845
01:14:05,759 --> 01:14:06,520
[SPEAKER_25]: I guess is what I'm saying.

846
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:08,021
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, no offense, but why should I believe him?

847
01:14:10,143 --> 01:14:21,993
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I don't really have any idea what kind of trust he gets in the community, although nobody seems to have been debunking it over at Aaron in Japan where everyone's elite.

848
01:14:23,494 --> 01:14:23,935
[SPEAKER_21]: Who knows?

849
01:14:25,137 --> 01:14:25,397
[SPEAKER_25]: Right on.

850
01:14:25,417 --> 01:14:27,077
[SPEAKER_25]: So what are your thoughts on this whole thing?

851
01:14:27,358 --> 01:14:31,839
[SPEAKER_25]: I remember that you were the one that actually dug up what really happened.

852
01:14:31,999 --> 01:14:33,459
[SPEAKER_25]: What did you think as you were reading it all?

853
01:14:34,839 --> 01:14:45,342
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, I guess I have a little bit of an interest in it to begin with because I've kind of taken it as a personal cause to be debunking all of these rumors with the history of the series and everything.

854
01:14:46,642 --> 01:14:49,283
[SPEAKER_25]: That Andamiro, those Andamiro's rumors and stuff?

855
01:14:49,443 --> 01:14:49,703
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, yeah.

856
01:14:49,723 --> 01:14:50,663
[SPEAKER_25]: They bug the hell out of me.

857
01:14:51,764 --> 01:14:52,504
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I just...

858
01:14:54,245 --> 01:15:05,551
[SPEAKER_21]: I really can't believe that people would think that as part of settling a lawsuit where you have the upper hand that you would offer to back out of the business market and not go back.

859
01:15:06,092 --> 01:15:07,072
[SPEAKER_25]: Exactly, exactly.

860
01:15:09,554 --> 01:15:13,016
[SPEAKER_25]: So what do you think is going to happen of this whole thing?

861
01:15:13,036 --> 01:15:17,258
[SPEAKER_25]: Do you think Konami has Rockstar's nuts here or what do you think might happen as of this?

862
01:15:18,719 --> 01:15:21,200
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, I could see it going a couple of different ways.

863
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:21,840
[SPEAKER_21]: I think the

864
01:15:23,587 --> 01:15:30,830
[SPEAKER_21]: The odds are definitely not in Roxor's favor, but this happens to be one special case.

865
01:15:31,610 --> 01:15:36,912
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm not generally the sort of person that seems to be privy to inside information or anything like that.

866
01:15:37,072 --> 01:15:40,294
[SPEAKER_21]: Usually I'm always hearing about things after the fact.

867
01:15:40,374 --> 01:15:50,278
[SPEAKER_21]: Not only was I happy to find out about this before anyone else, since I got word directly from ZipTie over at Konami, but basically...

868
01:15:51,300 --> 01:15:57,404
[SPEAKER_21]: There's a couple of things that we've learned which could end up turning this entire thing on its ear.

869
01:15:57,804 --> 01:16:02,748
[SPEAKER_21]: So I wouldn't have any preconceived notions with regards to how this is going to go.

870
01:16:03,228 --> 01:16:08,451
[SPEAKER_21]: All the fanboys need to die right now.

871
01:16:09,932 --> 01:16:15,636
[SPEAKER_25]: If I'm hearing you right, you say that there are things that we don't know about that could turn this whole thing upside down.

872
01:16:17,048 --> 01:16:20,909
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, and I'm not saying it's going to tilt it in any one direction or the other.

873
01:16:21,809 --> 01:16:32,572
[SPEAKER_21]: It's just... Well, basically, it's going to end up being the equivalent, I think, of somebody running in the courtroom and saying, Konami, I am your father.

874
01:16:34,093 --> 01:16:34,993
[SPEAKER_25]: Very interesting.

875
01:16:35,393 --> 01:16:35,933
[SPEAKER_21]: No!

876
01:16:36,253 --> 01:16:37,814
[SPEAKER_10]: That's not possible!

877
01:16:39,436 --> 01:16:45,658
[SPEAKER_21]: Which is basically the same thing I say about all the In The Groove fanboys that want to disown In The Groove from DDR.

878
01:16:46,038 --> 01:16:50,800
[SPEAKER_21]: Basically, Konami just comes over and says, No, Rocksaur, I am your father.

879
01:16:53,341 --> 01:17:00,783
[SPEAKER_25]: And that's exactly what I was saying about those people that are like, Oh my god, let's boycott Konami because they're evil assholes and da-da-da-da-da.

880
01:17:01,024 --> 01:17:06,706
[SPEAKER_25]: You know, if someone stole your shit and then repainted it a different color and put it out, you'd probably be pretty pissed off too.

881
01:17:07,166 --> 01:17:07,866
[SPEAKER_25]: You know, even if you...

882
01:17:08,442 --> 01:17:13,185
[SPEAKER_25]: I think you've even said something along the lines before about how with the community

883
01:17:20,620 --> 01:17:24,262
[SPEAKER_21]: It's DDR when it's convenient, and it's not DDR when it's convenient

884
01:17:44,705 --> 01:17:47,807
[SPEAKER_21]: I want to completely underscore something you said earlier.

885
01:17:47,947 --> 01:17:48,267
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

886
01:17:48,367 --> 01:17:49,407
[SPEAKER_21]: Just to make this clear.

887
01:17:49,607 --> 01:17:50,508
[SPEAKER_24]: Good, that'll make me feel good.

888
01:17:51,428 --> 01:17:53,609
[SPEAKER_21]: I have not had a chance to play in the groove yet.

889
01:17:54,230 --> 01:17:56,491
[SPEAKER_21]: I am very much looking forward to my chance.

890
01:17:56,991 --> 01:17:58,572
[SPEAKER_21]: It looks really nice to me.

891
01:17:58,712 --> 01:18:05,195
[SPEAKER_21]: I saw some people playing it at Anime Boston last month when I was in town for that, and it looks very slick.

892
01:18:06,015 --> 01:18:07,756
[SPEAKER_21]: It has some very good production quality.

893
01:18:08,576 --> 01:18:13,739
[SPEAKER_21]: I think that all the new modifiers and everything, yeah, they're step mania, but give me a bit.

894
01:18:14,774 --> 01:18:17,896
[SPEAKER_21]: I think it's something that DDR has needed for a while.

895
01:18:18,457 --> 01:18:21,860
[SPEAKER_21]: Basically it expands on DDR quite a bit and I really appreciate that.

896
01:18:22,380 --> 01:18:24,782
[SPEAKER_21]: I think it's really nice to carry the torch for the series.

897
01:18:25,383 --> 01:18:30,287
[SPEAKER_21]: The only thing that's ever really stopped me from having any serious interest in the game is the community.

898
01:18:30,847 --> 01:18:32,168
[SPEAKER_21]: There are some really good people there.

899
01:18:32,208 --> 01:18:37,973
[SPEAKER_21]: I've talked to several of the Rocksware employees and do talk to them on a regular basis and they're really great guys.

900
01:18:38,434 --> 01:18:38,754
[SPEAKER_21]: I just

901
01:18:39,742 --> 01:18:44,646
[SPEAKER_21]: There are some people in the community that just really need their sticks pulled out of their ass.

902
01:18:44,666 --> 01:18:49,130
[SPEAKER_25]: Their representation on the internet sucks, sadly, for them.

903
01:18:49,210 --> 01:18:57,358
[SPEAKER_25]: Because I'll tell you, at that in-the-group, I was kind of wincing walking in the door of that in-the-group premiere party because I thought people were going to beat me down with sticks.

904
01:18:57,378 --> 01:18:59,940
[SPEAKER_25]: But then I realized nobody listens to this show, so I was okay with it.

905
01:19:00,300 --> 01:19:03,964
[SPEAKER_25]: But I still thought that I was going to be confronted with just extreme asshole-ism.

906
01:19:05,169 --> 01:19:06,971
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I can definitely understand that.

907
01:19:06,991 --> 01:19:07,652
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, there's...

908
01:19:29,808 --> 01:19:40,150
[SPEAKER_21]: I think part of the problem is just that the people that are really big fans of In The Groove these days are in some ways really resentful of Konami for having, quote-unquote, abandoned them.

909
01:19:40,430 --> 01:19:45,691
[SPEAKER_21]: And so now they're being rebellious teenagers, if it were.

910
01:19:45,831 --> 01:19:58,933
[SPEAKER_25]: Do you think that that might be more fuel on this boycott fire, where if they feel abandoned by Konami, and now for Konami to suddenly go, wait a minute, even though I abandoned you, I'm going to sue this other game that's come out?

911
01:19:59,994 --> 01:20:02,135
[SPEAKER_21]: Why do people completely ignore the home versions?

912
01:20:22,304 --> 01:20:23,384
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, there's no bar to raise.

913
01:20:23,624 --> 01:20:24,345
[SPEAKER_25]: Exactly.

914
01:20:24,665 --> 01:20:27,505
[SPEAKER_25]: Although, I swear to God, Red Octane is thinking about doing one.

915
01:20:27,545 --> 01:20:30,146
[SPEAKER_25]: They're trying to see how they can do one at a good price.

916
01:20:30,406 --> 01:20:32,507
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, they're going to have to to support in the groove.

917
01:20:33,407 --> 01:20:34,867
[SPEAKER_25]: Your groove bar, 2.0.

918
01:20:36,408 --> 01:20:45,210
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I'm really glad that they're adding the novice system to the home version because that is something that appears to be greatly neglected.

919
01:20:45,330 --> 01:20:47,431
[SPEAKER_21]: I haven't looked over a lot of the step charts myself.

920
01:20:47,970 --> 01:20:55,792
[SPEAKER_21]: But I did get the impression that not a whole lot of pain was put into making of the light and standard steps.

921
01:20:56,472 --> 01:20:59,752
[SPEAKER_21]: Forgive me for not remembering the correct difficulty specifiers here.

922
01:21:00,212 --> 01:21:07,954
[SPEAKER_21]: But basically that's something that I know personally the step authors for Ultramix 2 put a lot of effort into.

923
01:21:08,294 --> 01:21:12,935
[SPEAKER_21]: They wanted to make sure that it was going to be fun to dance and play regardless of what level you're on.

924
01:21:13,862 --> 01:21:20,105
[SPEAKER_21]: There are quite a few songs I can think of on Trick, which are perfectly fun to play, and I don't have to be doing a 7 or 8 foot.

925
01:21:20,705 --> 01:21:30,230
[SPEAKER_25]: I think a lot of the reason, too, that the Ultramix 2 steps were so darn good was because Ultramix 1 really screwed some steps up, especially when it came to the song packs.

926
01:21:31,110 --> 01:21:37,193
[SPEAKER_25]: So I think they really learned from their mistakes, and they almost overcompensated the steps were so damn good.

927
01:21:37,313 --> 01:21:37,873
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, really.

928
01:21:39,134 --> 01:21:40,574
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, not a whole lot wrong with that.

929
01:21:40,774 --> 01:21:42,275
[SPEAKER_25]: No, we all win from that, I guess.

930
01:21:44,771 --> 01:21:47,833
[SPEAKER_25]: So I guess it's going to be a very interesting E3.

931
01:21:48,833 --> 01:21:50,634
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know if Rockstar is one.

932
01:21:50,714 --> 01:21:54,577
[SPEAKER_25]: I haven't checked the E3 list, but I'm sure Red Octane is one of the scheduled exhibitors.

933
01:21:54,897 --> 01:21:56,258
[SPEAKER_25]: It's going to be very interesting.

934
01:21:56,358 --> 01:22:00,040
[SPEAKER_25]: I want to go by their booth Wednesday morning and see if there's any mention of In the Groove.

935
01:22:00,340 --> 01:22:01,681
[SPEAKER_25]: I think it's going to be very interesting.

936
01:22:02,061 --> 01:22:05,143
[SPEAKER_25]: What do you think is going to come at E3 from those companies?

937
01:22:06,564 --> 01:22:08,125
[SPEAKER_21]: I haven't heard the latest word.

938
01:22:08,145 --> 01:22:10,226
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm sure Michael Wynn has his

939
01:22:11,986 --> 01:22:12,947
[SPEAKER_21]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

940
01:22:34,383 --> 01:22:40,207
[SPEAKER_21]: But yeah, we're going to be going over there so that we can take a look at the forthcoming release of Pump It Up Exceed.

941
01:22:40,347 --> 01:22:42,589
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, I was going to hit on this a little later in the show.

942
01:22:42,609 --> 01:22:44,870
[SPEAKER_25]: I'll go into more detail later, but you're right.

943
01:22:44,930 --> 01:22:47,612
[SPEAKER_25]: MadCatz has announced that they are going to be the ones publishing.

944
01:22:48,073 --> 01:22:50,494
[SPEAKER_25]: And you're right, the cringe was the first thing I did.

945
01:22:50,534 --> 01:22:55,318
[SPEAKER_25]: Actually, my very first thought was, I hope they don't fuck it up like they did their GameCube release.

946
01:22:56,718 --> 01:22:59,319
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't have a whole lot of background in the Pump It Up scene.

947
01:22:59,399 --> 01:23:04,141
[SPEAKER_25]: I actually have an exceed in a movie theater about an hour from me, and that's all that I've really played of it.

948
01:23:04,181 --> 01:23:07,402
[SPEAKER_25]: But CJ Iwakura made a post on our thread on DDR Freak

949
01:23:22,697 --> 01:23:28,902
[SPEAKER_21]: where he basically had indicated that the bundled pad is going to be the exact same one that came out with the Konami release.

950
01:23:29,342 --> 01:23:38,850
[SPEAKER_21]: So regardless of the fact that it is Mad Catz publishing the game, hopefully those of you who are pumpers out there won't have anything really to worry about.

951
01:23:39,451 --> 01:23:39,771
[SPEAKER_25]: Phew.

952
01:23:41,280 --> 01:23:42,161
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, but I don't know.

953
01:23:42,201 --> 01:23:52,047
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm still a little nervous about having to buy a new dance pad just because the arrows are all different and stuff anyway, which is why In The Groove, had it been released on the home, would have been kind of a nice addition to the library.

954
01:23:52,327 --> 01:23:54,469
[SPEAKER_25]: But with Pump It Up, it's like, great, I've got to get another mat.

955
01:23:55,350 --> 01:24:07,938
[SPEAKER_25]: But if it's a good, solid mat, then, you know, and it's a reasonable price, which I think $60 is what they're currently asking for, it is somewhat reasonable, excuse me, considering everything you get, then, yeah, I'll probably check it out.

956
01:24:08,823 --> 01:24:18,291
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I think that's about the standard price, because if I remember correctly, the DDR bundles that Konami has been putting out lately with the Mark II softpad, those are $60, I'm pretty sure.

957
01:24:18,511 --> 01:24:20,013
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, they're about $60 as well.

958
01:24:21,374 --> 01:24:22,915
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, anything else you want to share with us, Cutris?

959
01:24:23,416 --> 01:24:25,437
[SPEAKER_25]: Very interesting perspective, enjoy having you on the show.

960
01:24:25,457 --> 01:24:26,698
[SPEAKER_25]: You've got to call in more often, buddy.

961
01:24:27,879 --> 01:24:31,262
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, now that I actually have a working setup, perhaps I'll do just that.

962
01:24:31,502 --> 01:24:32,523
[SPEAKER_25]: There you go.

963
01:24:33,284 --> 01:24:35,486
[SPEAKER_25]: Let's meet up at E3, since you're going to be going next week, right?

964
01:24:36,460 --> 01:24:37,801
[SPEAKER_21]: Absolutely.

965
01:24:37,821 --> 01:24:48,169
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know if Shane gave you the schedule or anything that we've kind of got tentative so far, but I definitely want to make sure that I get to hang out with you guys a lot.

966
01:24:48,309 --> 01:24:54,373
[SPEAKER_25]: I have heard the DDR Freak mod schedule loosely, what's going on, obviously, because DarkSakura is a big part of that.

967
01:24:54,673 --> 01:24:57,996
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know if that includes you and Shane or what, but send me an email.

968
01:24:58,036 --> 01:24:58,716
[SPEAKER_25]: We'll work something out.

969
01:24:59,917 --> 01:25:00,257
[SPEAKER_21]: Absolutely.

970
01:25:00,317 --> 01:25:01,478
[SPEAKER_25]: One more quick question before we go.

971
01:25:01,498 --> 01:25:02,519
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay.

972
01:25:03,465 --> 01:25:06,706
[SPEAKER_25]: non-music game related thing you're most looking forward to seeing at E3?

973
01:25:09,467 --> 01:25:18,769
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, if you had said non-Bimani, then I probably could have answered that right off because I'm really demanding some information about Jam with the Band.

974
01:25:19,829 --> 01:25:25,511
[SPEAKER_21]: But I guess in that vein, I'm really looking forward to whatever Nintendo has set up for the DS.

975
01:25:25,551 --> 01:25:26,091
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm actually a

976
01:25:26,884 --> 01:25:35,406
[SPEAKER_21]: Since I'm not sure if they're going to be offering downloadables for some of their games, or if they're just going to be sending out demos for Mario Kart DS and whatnot...

977
01:25:50,230 --> 01:25:53,132
[SPEAKER_25]: How great is it going to be to just be able to download it and play it on your own damn DS?

978
01:25:53,332 --> 01:25:56,013
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, that's going to be absolutely fantastic.

979
01:25:56,333 --> 01:25:57,634
[SPEAKER_21]: Not to have to wait in line.

980
01:25:57,994 --> 01:26:02,376
[SPEAKER_21]: And just because of the way this is working, I'm not taking any chances here.

981
01:26:02,716 --> 01:26:06,778
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm bringing both mine and my wife's DS with me and all the games.

982
01:26:07,058 --> 01:26:08,559
[SPEAKER_21]: So I'm totally confiscating all of that.

983
01:26:08,579 --> 01:26:09,660
[SPEAKER_25]: You're all ready to go.

984
01:26:10,420 --> 01:26:11,281
[SPEAKER_25]: You're all ready to go.

985
01:26:11,421 --> 01:26:11,901
[SPEAKER_25]: Absolutely.

986
01:26:11,921 --> 01:26:13,101
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm going to bring all my stuff too.

987
01:26:14,082 --> 01:26:15,282
[SPEAKER_25]: We'll have to have a DS war or something.

988
01:26:15,302 --> 01:26:18,264
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm bringing my 8th style because I must hunt my hero down.

989
01:26:18,846 --> 01:26:19,727
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, Akira, if he's there?

990
01:26:19,987 --> 01:26:20,527
[SPEAKER_25]: I hope so.

991
01:26:21,088 --> 01:26:23,310
[SPEAKER_25]: Loki said he's bringing his PSP.

992
01:26:23,350 --> 01:26:25,451
[SPEAKER_25]: He's not taking any chances because he knows PSP's online.

993
01:26:25,471 --> 01:26:27,373
[SPEAKER_25]: He says they could have something surprising.

994
01:26:27,393 --> 01:26:28,554
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm bringing my PSP, too.

995
01:26:29,334 --> 01:26:34,158
[SPEAKER_25]: I said you're a brave man to bring all that crap with you to L.A., especially after my car got broken into this week, but we'll see.

996
01:26:35,159 --> 01:26:35,639
[SPEAKER_25]: All right, buddy.

997
01:26:35,659 --> 01:26:41,303
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, I'm going to let you go so we can get to some more calls, but thank you very much for calling in, and we'll see you at E3, all right?

998
01:26:42,264 --> 01:26:42,704
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, sir.

999
01:26:42,744 --> 01:26:43,425
[SPEAKER_21]: Thanks for having me.

1000
01:26:43,485 --> 01:26:43,665
[SPEAKER_21]: All right.

1001
01:26:43,685 --> 01:26:44,246
[SPEAKER_25]: Have a good one, buddy.

1002
01:26:45,567 --> 01:26:45,767
[SPEAKER_25]: Bye-bye.

1003
01:26:45,807 --> 01:26:46,007
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

1004
01:26:47,915 --> 01:26:49,056
[SPEAKER_25]: Cutress from DDR Freak.

1005
01:26:49,596 --> 01:26:56,280
[SPEAKER_25]: www.ddrfreak.com Also the home of our replays that we do Friday nights over on DDR Freak Radio.

1006
01:26:56,320 --> 01:26:56,861
[SPEAKER_25]: So check it out.

1007
01:26:56,881 --> 01:26:59,422
[SPEAKER_25]: They've been very supportive of us in about the past year or so.

1008
01:27:00,183 --> 01:27:01,844
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, you know, really ever since the beginning.

1009
01:27:02,084 --> 01:27:02,884
[SPEAKER_25]: We've got to work together.

1010
01:27:02,964 --> 01:27:04,385
[SPEAKER_25]: But just even more so.

1011
01:27:04,425 --> 01:27:05,986
[SPEAKER_25]: Like I've really been feeling the love the past year.

1012
01:27:06,126 --> 01:27:06,807
[SPEAKER_25]: So it's great.

1013
01:27:07,587 --> 01:27:08,047
[SPEAKER_25]: Let's move on.

1014
01:27:08,067 --> 01:27:08,708
[SPEAKER_25]: Let's take another call.

1015
01:27:09,768 --> 01:27:11,690
[SPEAKER_25]: This person's been calling in for like an hour now.

1016
01:27:11,750 --> 01:27:12,250
[SPEAKER_25]: Sorry, dude.

1017
01:27:12,270 --> 01:27:12,650
[SPEAKER_25]: What's up?

1018
01:27:12,690 --> 01:27:13,531
[SPEAKER_25]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge.

1019
01:27:15,017 --> 01:27:18,138
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, this is SSJ100Mad and Sephiroth1215.

1020
01:27:18,178 --> 01:27:18,678
[SPEAKER_25]: Two of you!

1021
01:27:20,438 --> 01:27:20,578
[SPEAKER_25]: Ah!

1022
01:27:20,798 --> 01:27:21,199
[SPEAKER_25]: Amazing.

1023
01:27:21,219 --> 01:27:23,359
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know if we can handle that much input, but we'll try.

1024
01:27:23,419 --> 01:27:23,719
[SPEAKER_25]: What's up?

1025
01:27:23,759 --> 01:27:25,319
[SPEAKER_25]: What's your guys' thoughts on the lawsuit?

1026
01:27:27,180 --> 01:27:27,800
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, I don't know.

1027
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:30,141
[SPEAKER_27]: I think Rockstar had this coming.

1028
01:27:30,161 --> 01:27:39,743
[SPEAKER_25]: I think they planned it out already, so... Wait, so you think Rockstar... Are you saying this whole thing is just smoke and mirrors and that Rockstar has planned this all along?

1029
01:27:41,365 --> 01:27:43,066
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't know, they can't be this stupid.

1030
01:27:43,106 --> 01:27:44,787
[SPEAKER_27]: They had to have known this was going to happen.

1031
01:27:45,927 --> 01:27:48,408
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm going to go back to what I said earlier about Rockstar's lawyers.

1032
01:27:48,448 --> 01:28:05,076
[SPEAKER_25]: I think when they were clearing everything and seeing if everything was okay with this, they were probably focusing on the software element of it because you have to admit, the software looks a lot like DDR and they weren't focusing enough on the hardware part of it and somebody really, really fucked up.

1033
01:28:06,601 --> 01:28:07,562
[SPEAKER_27]: Someone didn't get the memo.

1034
01:28:07,942 --> 01:28:08,943
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, someone didn't get the memo.

1035
01:28:09,023 --> 01:28:10,023
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know, but I could be wrong.

1036
01:28:10,064 --> 01:28:11,024
[SPEAKER_25]: We'll see.

1037
01:28:11,224 --> 01:28:14,506
[SPEAKER_25]: Unfortunately, the community has been too arrogant to fill me in any other way.

1038
01:28:16,287 --> 01:28:22,791
[SPEAKER_02]: Got their head shoved way up their asses to the point that they're tasting like tonsil or something.

1039
01:28:22,811 --> 01:28:28,675
[SPEAKER_27]: I know, but this whole thing kind of sucks that people who pre-owned it like Sephiroth right over here.

1040
01:28:30,196 --> 01:28:33,398
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, the folks that pre-ordered it from Red Octane have no idea what's going to happen?

1041
01:28:34,855 --> 01:28:36,877
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, I know, that's got to be kind of weird.

1042
01:28:36,937 --> 01:28:58,774
[SPEAKER_25]: In fact, somebody was actually mentioning to me in the chat room in private message, I hope Dark Knight doesn't mind me reading this, but he said that he actually went over to a GameStop Sunday and they told him it's going to come out May 26th and no info from the lawsuit had reached them yet about it, but I say don't hold your breath because GameStop, electronic boutiques and stuff, never write with this crap, especially when things are getting delayed.

1043
01:28:59,474 --> 01:29:02,116
[SPEAKER_25]: Sorry, but you cannot count on that May 26th date.

1044
01:29:02,196 --> 01:29:04,018
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll have the word as soon as GameStop gets it.

1045
01:29:05,017 --> 01:29:10,302
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, because you had the luxury of being with the manager of the GameStop and everything.

1046
01:29:11,222 --> 01:29:11,783
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, definitely.

1047
01:29:11,883 --> 01:29:17,087
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, now GameStop's owned EB, so... Well, that's true.

1048
01:29:17,107 --> 01:29:21,591
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but that was pretty cool.

1049
01:29:21,771 --> 01:29:22,972
[SPEAKER_25]: Any other thoughts on the lawsuit?

1050
01:29:23,072 --> 01:29:24,193
[SPEAKER_25]: Any other things you want to share with us?

1051
01:29:26,475 --> 01:29:29,398
[SPEAKER_27]: Nope, just good to be home back in New York, and...

1052
01:29:30,646 --> 01:29:31,286
[SPEAKER_27]: Have a good time.

1053
01:29:58,254 --> 01:29:58,794
[SPEAKER_27]: We got a lot.

1054
01:29:58,974 --> 01:29:59,735
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright, sounds good.

1055
01:29:59,775 --> 01:30:01,316
[SPEAKER_25]: How about your friend who's there?

1056
01:30:02,897 --> 01:30:03,757
[SPEAKER_25]: Pass the mic or something.

1057
01:30:04,117 --> 01:30:04,418
[SPEAKER_25]: Hello?

1058
01:30:05,818 --> 01:30:06,139
[SPEAKER_25]: Hold on.

1059
01:30:06,439 --> 01:30:06,699
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay.

1060
01:30:07,640 --> 01:30:08,100
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes, sir.

1061
01:30:09,781 --> 01:30:10,121
[SPEAKER_25]: Hello?

1062
01:30:10,741 --> 01:30:11,042
[SPEAKER_25]: Hi.

1063
01:30:11,422 --> 01:30:12,662
[SPEAKER_25]: And this is Seproth?

1064
01:30:13,023 --> 01:30:14,924
[SPEAKER_25]: No, this is... Is this Seproth?

1065
01:30:14,944 --> 01:30:15,304
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, yeah.

1066
01:30:16,104 --> 01:30:16,785
[SPEAKER_25]: Hey, how you doing?

1067
01:30:17,245 --> 01:30:18,486
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm good.

1068
01:30:18,566 --> 01:30:20,147
[SPEAKER_26]: Your thoughts on the lawsuit?

1069
01:30:21,938 --> 01:30:33,047
[SPEAKER_26]: Um, yeah, you know, I think they really just screwed up on how they put the game on the DDR machines, but otherwise I think everything else should have been fine.

1070
01:30:33,067 --> 01:30:36,990
[SPEAKER_26]: That should be like the main thing that Konami should have just sued for.

1071
01:30:37,210 --> 01:30:41,694
[SPEAKER_25]: It's almost like they learned their lesson within the group too, but it's like, too late, whoops.

1072
01:30:42,697 --> 01:30:45,178
[SPEAKER_26]: So, yeah, you got a good point there.

1073
01:30:45,398 --> 01:30:46,298
[SPEAKER_25]: Anything else you want to share with us?

1074
01:30:46,318 --> 01:30:47,198
[SPEAKER_26]: That sucks.

1075
01:30:48,339 --> 01:30:49,119
[SPEAKER_26]: No, not really.

1076
01:30:49,499 --> 01:30:49,779
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay.

1077
01:30:50,539 --> 01:30:51,080
[SPEAKER_26]: All right, well.

1078
01:30:51,260 --> 01:30:58,802
[SPEAKER_26]: Except for, yeah, I'm pretty pissed that, you know, I pre-ordered that in the groove with the Astro Burner pad bundle.

1079
01:30:59,242 --> 01:31:01,884
[SPEAKER_25]: You won't be disappointed with the Afterburner pad, I'll tell you that.

1080
01:31:02,304 --> 01:31:04,826
[SPEAKER_25]: I have good things to say about the Afterburner pad, it's marvelous.

1081
01:31:05,646 --> 01:31:07,127
[SPEAKER_25]: But yeah, unfortunately.

1082
01:31:07,347 --> 01:31:15,352
[SPEAKER_25]: You know what though, Red Octane, from what I've seen, they're a decent company, and they'll do something for you when they give you your money back, if it comes to that.

1083
01:31:15,432 --> 01:31:22,736
[SPEAKER_25]: Hopefully it won't, something will be able to happen, or Indigroove can still come out in some capacity, but time will tell.

1084
01:31:22,876 --> 01:31:25,278
[SPEAKER_25]: I think we'll find out shortly after E3 what's going to happen.

1085
01:31:26,244 --> 01:31:34,486
[SPEAKER_25]: or I don't know, we could find out next week because what a good time to release that kind of news during E3 when there's so much other stuff to divert people's attention.

1086
01:31:34,926 --> 01:31:36,366
[SPEAKER_25]: It'll kind of be a good time, you know.

1087
01:31:37,146 --> 01:31:38,286
[SPEAKER_25]: Everybody's looking over here.

1088
01:31:38,366 --> 01:31:39,267
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, by the way, we settled.

1089
01:31:39,907 --> 01:31:40,427
[SPEAKER_25]: So we'll see.

1090
01:31:42,687 --> 01:31:43,528
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, hopefully.

1091
01:31:43,688 --> 01:31:43,988
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright.

1092
01:31:44,488 --> 01:31:48,208
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, I'm going to let you go so we can get some more calls but thank you guys both for calling in, alright?

1093
01:31:49,269 --> 01:31:49,929
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, no problem.

1094
01:31:50,049 --> 01:31:55,570
[SPEAKER_25]: And I like this idea, by the way, of the Orange Lounge Radio listening parties so you guys keep it up.

1095
01:31:57,756 --> 01:31:58,377
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright, later.

1096
01:32:00,098 --> 01:32:00,379
[SPEAKER_25]: Bye.

1097
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:03,702
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't think he knew what to think of that comment.

1098
01:32:05,223 --> 01:32:06,084
[SPEAKER_25]: Let's go to this call.

1099
01:32:06,124 --> 01:32:07,425
[SPEAKER_25]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1100
01:32:08,706 --> 01:32:09,126
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, what's up?

1101
01:32:09,186 --> 01:32:10,207
[SPEAKER_14]: It's Ranma from New York.

1102
01:32:10,227 --> 01:32:11,528
[SPEAKER_25]: Hello, Ranma from New York.

1103
01:32:12,809 --> 01:32:14,811
[SPEAKER_25]: We just got off the phone with some folks from New York.

1104
01:32:15,351 --> 01:32:16,993
[SPEAKER_25]: Did you hear what I said to the other guys from New York?

1105
01:32:18,601 --> 01:32:19,381
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, I did.

1106
01:32:19,562 --> 01:32:21,503
[SPEAKER_14]: And when you come to New York, I'm going to show you around.

1107
01:32:21,723 --> 01:32:21,963
[SPEAKER_25]: All right.

1108
01:32:22,203 --> 01:32:26,705
[SPEAKER_25]: Actually, I have a really good friend, one of my best friends in the whole wide world, lives in Connecticut.

1109
01:32:26,965 --> 01:32:29,046
[SPEAKER_25]: But that's just a hop, skip it, or jump away from NYC.

1110
01:32:29,106 --> 01:32:30,067
[SPEAKER_25]: So we're looking into it.

1111
01:32:31,328 --> 01:32:32,248
[SPEAKER_25]: Sweet, sweet.

1112
01:32:32,608 --> 01:32:33,229
[SPEAKER_25]: So what's on your mind?

1113
01:32:34,489 --> 01:32:34,949
[SPEAKER_14]: Not much.

1114
01:32:35,210 --> 01:32:40,692
[SPEAKER_14]: One thing about this whole lawsuit thing, I think Rockstar had a pretty good idea of what was going to happen when they did this.

1115
01:32:40,852 --> 01:32:42,193
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, put it in a DDR machine.

1116
01:32:42,393 --> 01:32:42,894
[SPEAKER_14]: Save money.

1117
01:32:43,094 --> 01:32:43,734
[SPEAKER_14]: Look what I got you.

1118
01:32:46,603 --> 01:32:47,364
[SPEAKER_25]: Maybe you got a good point.

1119
01:32:47,424 --> 01:32:54,050
[SPEAKER_25]: Rockstar being the startup it was, just kind of did this as a cost-saving thing, not really thinking about the ramifications of what it could have.

1120
01:32:54,850 --> 01:32:55,571
[SPEAKER_25]: Interesting perspective.

1121
01:32:55,591 --> 01:32:56,031
[SPEAKER_25]: Basically.

1122
01:32:56,692 --> 01:32:57,112
[SPEAKER_25]: Interesting.

1123
01:32:58,493 --> 01:33:00,055
[SPEAKER_25]: What are your personal thoughts on the lawsuit?

1124
01:33:00,075 --> 01:33:01,376
[SPEAKER_25]: What do you think will happen because of this?

1125
01:33:02,902 --> 01:33:08,889
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll wait.

1126
01:33:09,470 --> 01:33:14,336
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll personally wait because I know as soon as I say I want my money back, the game comes out and I won't have the money for it.

1127
01:33:16,518 --> 01:33:19,422
[SPEAKER_25]: So you actually pre-ordered it at this Anime Expo?

1128
01:33:20,816 --> 01:33:21,656
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, Anime Boston.

1129
01:33:21,756 --> 01:33:22,517
[SPEAKER_25]: Anime Boston.

1130
01:33:22,597 --> 01:33:25,818
[SPEAKER_25]: And that must have been last weekend before this whole news came out, right?

1131
01:33:26,498 --> 01:33:28,118
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, that's right, because you gave us your wrap-up last week.

1132
01:33:28,138 --> 01:33:28,858
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1133
01:33:28,938 --> 01:33:29,219
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay.

1134
01:33:30,199 --> 01:33:31,559
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, man, that's crappy timing.

1135
01:33:31,599 --> 01:33:32,620
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm sorry to hear that happen to you.

1136
01:33:33,680 --> 01:33:34,180
[SPEAKER_14]: That's okay.

1137
01:33:34,240 --> 01:33:34,740
[SPEAKER_14]: It's okay.

1138
01:33:34,840 --> 01:33:35,140
[SPEAKER_25]: All right.

1139
01:33:36,201 --> 01:33:37,661
[SPEAKER_25]: One other thing before we go to another call.

1140
01:33:39,182 --> 01:33:41,222
[SPEAKER_25]: Thing you are most looking forward to hearing about from E3?

1141
01:33:43,443 --> 01:33:44,563
[SPEAKER_14]: Nintendo Revolution.

1142
01:33:44,723 --> 01:33:50,145
[SPEAKER_14]: And before I go, I'm posting a link from my website to the whole Nintendo World Extravaganza Saturday.

1143
01:33:51,105 --> 01:33:53,447
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, the opening of the store.

1144
01:33:54,288 --> 01:33:56,049
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to hear about that.

1145
01:33:56,149 --> 01:33:56,990
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, tell us more about that.

1146
01:33:57,030 --> 01:33:57,930
[SPEAKER_25]: How was the opening of the store?

1147
01:33:58,851 --> 01:34:00,732
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, I got to about 9.30ish.

1148
01:34:00,812 --> 01:34:01,733
[SPEAKER_14]: It was kind of quiet.

1149
01:34:01,853 --> 01:34:05,116
[SPEAKER_14]: When they picked up some friends, we got back around 11ish.

1150
01:34:05,456 --> 01:34:06,977
[SPEAKER_14]: It was jam-packed.

1151
01:34:07,297 --> 01:34:10,960
[SPEAKER_14]: Almost every other person was walking around with a DS, nothing but chats.

1152
01:34:11,340 --> 01:34:16,544
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm walking up and down the lines taking pictures, and there were two people with PSPs that were getting booed.

1153
01:34:17,441 --> 01:34:17,941
Oh, okay.

1154
01:34:46,892 --> 01:34:47,973
[SPEAKER_25]: Wow, interesting.

1155
01:34:48,753 --> 01:34:52,415
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, well, wow, definitely check out that site and look at the pictures there.

1156
01:34:52,595 --> 01:34:56,657
[SPEAKER_25]: One other thing I want to... Did they have DS downloadable or anything there?

1157
01:34:57,197 --> 01:34:57,417
[SPEAKER_25]: No.

1158
01:34:58,138 --> 01:34:58,718
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, bummer.

1159
01:34:58,758 --> 01:34:59,759
[SPEAKER_25]: I was kind of hoping they would.

1160
01:35:00,099 --> 01:35:01,960
[SPEAKER_25]: Give us a sign of what's going to come up for V3.

1161
01:35:03,641 --> 01:35:12,825
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know, but one funny thing was they were handing out free DS silos as you walked in, and they also had little bottles of Nintendo World Water for you to drink.

1162
01:35:13,045 --> 01:35:14,746
[SPEAKER_25]: Nintendo World Water.

1163
01:35:15,086 --> 01:35:15,687
[SPEAKER_25]: That's awesome.

1164
01:35:15,727 --> 01:35:15,887
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1165
01:35:16,769 --> 01:35:19,290
[SPEAKER_25]: Pikachu Beetle Pikachu Beetle Pikachu Beetle Pikachu Beetle

1166
01:35:46,710 --> 01:35:47,911
[SPEAKER_25]: Is that from his picture down there?

1167
01:35:47,971 --> 01:35:49,112
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, that's cute.

1168
01:35:49,172 --> 01:35:53,416
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright, we're going to do another call because there's another person who's been trying to get in and call, so we're going to take this call.

1169
01:35:53,737 --> 01:35:54,978
[SPEAKER_25]: Hello, you're on Orange Dance Radio.

1170
01:35:56,179 --> 01:35:56,459
[SPEAKER_25]: Hello.

1171
01:35:56,800 --> 01:35:57,280
[SPEAKER_22]: Hi, who's this?

1172
01:35:58,321 --> 01:35:59,042
[SPEAKER_22]: This is Jaded.

1173
01:35:59,582 --> 01:36:00,063
[SPEAKER_25]: Jaded!

1174
01:36:00,283 --> 01:36:00,803
[SPEAKER_25]: What's on your mind?

1175
01:36:02,685 --> 01:36:03,566
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, nothing much.

1176
01:36:04,175 --> 01:36:06,437
[SPEAKER_25]: What do you think about this whole lawsuit going on right now?

1177
01:36:06,537 --> 01:36:07,677
[SPEAKER_25]: Konami versus Roxxor?

1178
01:36:07,697 --> 01:36:11,900
[SPEAKER_22]: I just think right now it's too early to make any kind of intelligent decisions.

1179
01:36:11,940 --> 01:36:12,501
[SPEAKER_25]: You know what?

1180
01:36:12,901 --> 01:36:14,142
[SPEAKER_25]: You bring up a damn good point.

1181
01:36:14,262 --> 01:36:22,567
[SPEAKER_25]: And even from somebody who's been sitting here yapping about it for about the past hour, it really is too early to make an informed decision about everything.

1182
01:36:22,627 --> 01:36:27,931
[SPEAKER_25]: Although, I gotta hand it off, because of the DDR Freak releasing the actual documents...

1183
01:36:28,311 --> 01:36:32,458
[SPEAKER_25]: That helped immensely in trying to figure out, you know, where's Konami coming from on this whole thing.

1184
01:36:32,779 --> 01:36:42,795
[SPEAKER_25]: And I think it actually took some of the evilness, the big bad Konami-ness, like, I think it kind of took some of that out because people looked at it and went, you know, well, they kind of do have a point.

1185
01:36:44,349 --> 01:36:45,610
[SPEAKER_25]: They kind of do have a point.

1186
01:36:45,830 --> 01:36:48,732
[SPEAKER_22]: Right now, it's just too early.

1187
01:36:49,192 --> 01:36:54,715
[SPEAKER_22]: Everybody is saying that it's going to go several different ways.

1188
01:36:55,836 --> 01:36:59,178
[SPEAKER_22]: Right now, I'm just personally not believing anything.

1189
01:36:59,778 --> 01:37:01,659
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm just personally thinking that it's too early.

1190
01:37:01,859 --> 01:37:05,261
[SPEAKER_25]: You just have your hands over your ears going, I can't hear you, I can't hear you.

1191
01:37:08,003 --> 01:37:09,704
[SPEAKER_25]: Have you pre-ordered in the groove?

1192
01:37:10,729 --> 01:37:11,210
[SPEAKER_25]: No, I haven't.

1193
01:37:11,250 --> 01:37:16,863
[SPEAKER_25]: I was just curious if you were one of those customers, because I know if I was one of those people that had pre-ordered in the groove, I'd probably be a lot like that right now.

1194
01:37:17,223 --> 01:37:18,025
[SPEAKER_25]: I did not just waste $40.

1195
01:37:18,105 --> 01:37:19,308
[SPEAKER_25]: La, la, la, la, la.

1196
01:37:19,368 --> 01:37:19,569
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah.

1197
01:37:21,877 --> 01:37:22,357
[SPEAKER_25]: Dark Day Dark Day

1198
01:37:49,276 --> 01:37:51,040
[SPEAKER_25]: Um, nevermind, I just turned on a light in here.

1199
01:37:51,240 --> 01:37:52,583
[SPEAKER_25]: Our webcam, OrangeLensRadio.com.

1200
01:37:53,224 --> 01:37:56,510
[SPEAKER_25]: Um, thing you're most looking forward to hearing about from E3 next week?

1201
01:37:58,052 --> 01:38:01,753
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm just looking forward to the Final Fantasy Advent Children news.

1202
01:38:27,199 --> 01:38:27,400
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah.

1203
01:38:28,182 --> 01:38:29,425
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm hoping they do that again this year.

1204
01:38:30,007 --> 01:38:32,553
[SPEAKER_25]: I wish they'd just screen the whole damn movie so we could see it.

1205
01:38:32,974 --> 01:38:33,857
[SPEAKER_25]: But I know that won't happen.

1206
01:38:34,157 --> 01:38:35,922
[SPEAKER_25]: Because they know that a lot of the fanboys are going to be there.

1207
01:38:39,206 --> 01:38:47,629
[SPEAKER_22]: The reason why I'm interested in this is that it's been delayed multiple times, and frankly, I'm waiting for something to happen.

1208
01:38:47,849 --> 01:38:48,369
[SPEAKER_25]: Very true.

1209
01:38:48,449 --> 01:39:00,292
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, I know that we had posted a story earlier that you, being a big fan of Advent Children, probably have already heard this, but for those that didn't hear about this yet, actually, they did announce that there was going to be a date for this.

1210
01:39:00,952 --> 01:39:25,392
[SPEAKER_25]: and it's going to be simultaneous, if I remember right, between the US and Japan so those of you that sometimes feel shafted that Squeenix always gives Japan the good stuff weeks before, or I'm sorry, months, even a year before we get it let's see, the date is September 14th, 2005 simultaneous release in America and Japan UMD release, not a part of that, this is only the DVD but that should be cool right

1211
01:39:27,183 --> 01:39:35,827
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright, well thanks for calling and you know what, thanks for bringing up a point that, you know, we really don't know what the hell we're talking about in some aspects with this.

1212
01:39:36,248 --> 01:39:37,228
[SPEAKER_25]: So we'll see what happens.

1213
01:39:38,369 --> 01:39:39,669
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright, have a good one.

1214
01:39:40,009 --> 01:39:40,890
[SPEAKER_25]: It was nice talking to you.

1215
01:39:41,010 --> 01:39:41,990
[SPEAKER_25]: Nice talking to you, thanks for calling.

1216
01:39:42,791 --> 01:39:43,011
[SPEAKER_25]: Later.

1217
01:39:43,331 --> 01:39:43,471
[SPEAKER_25]: Bye.

1218
01:39:44,972 --> 01:39:45,632
[SPEAKER_25]: That was nice.

1219
01:39:47,233 --> 01:39:48,653
[SPEAKER_25]: A nice young man there calling in.

1220
01:39:48,893 --> 01:39:49,354
[SPEAKER_25]: That was good.

1221
01:39:49,454 --> 01:39:49,754
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright.

1222
01:39:50,566 --> 01:39:51,747
[SPEAKER_25]: and Intelligence Perspective.

1223
01:39:51,787 --> 01:39:52,288
[SPEAKER_25]: We like that.

1224
01:40:11,611 --> 01:40:12,852
[SPEAKER_25]: So we were lucky in that.

1225
01:40:12,892 --> 01:40:16,475
[SPEAKER_25]: So we do have a full-blown regular cage match for you guys tonight.

1226
01:40:16,975 --> 01:40:21,078
[SPEAKER_25]: So without further ado, let's get into the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match.

1227
01:40:21,298 --> 01:40:23,740
[SPEAKER_25]: For those of you guys still trying to get in on the Skype line, no worries.

1228
01:40:23,820 --> 01:40:26,022
[SPEAKER_25]: We will take more calls a little later in the show.

1229
01:40:26,102 --> 01:40:27,903
[SPEAKER_25]: So just be patient.

1230
01:40:28,103 --> 01:40:28,964
[SPEAKER_25]: Sorry you didn't get through yet.

1231
01:40:30,405 --> 01:40:30,725
[SPEAKER_25]: All right.

1232
01:40:31,542 --> 01:40:34,343
[SPEAKER_25]: Remember, the way the cage match works, you have to be in our chat room.

1233
01:40:34,663 --> 01:40:38,124
[SPEAKER_25]: www.orangeloungeradio.com Click on chat.

1234
01:40:38,504 --> 01:40:41,205
[SPEAKER_25]: The way this works, we play three songs for you guys.

1235
01:40:41,565 --> 01:40:49,188
[SPEAKER_25]: You pick your favorite, and the winning song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's Gaming Music and More program.

1236
01:40:49,588 --> 01:40:53,892
[SPEAKER_25]: which plays 24 hours a day, 7 days a week on this station when we aren't live.

1237
01:40:54,393 --> 01:40:55,874
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright, let's get into it.

1238
01:40:55,894 --> 01:41:03,682
[SPEAKER_25]: Last week in the cage match, Jamie had put a song in, and you know that right now Jamie is all about the gorillas.

1239
01:41:04,835 --> 01:41:05,996
[SPEAKER_25]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1240
01:41:23,411 --> 01:41:30,617
[SPEAKER_25]: This was interesting because last week a little bit of controversy because the song is very quirky and a lot of people either loved it or they hated it.

1241
01:41:30,917 --> 01:41:37,282
[SPEAKER_25]: But what happened last week is that it was up against two trance songs which ended up kind of splitting the vote a little bit causing this one to win.

1242
01:41:37,302 --> 01:41:38,523
[SPEAKER_25]: I think it would be a fair thing to say.

1243
01:41:38,963 --> 01:41:41,065
[SPEAKER_25]: So we shall see if it hangs on again tonight.

1244
01:41:41,485 --> 01:41:42,746
[SPEAKER_25]: Here it is, song number one.

1245
01:41:42,886 --> 01:41:44,688
[SPEAKER_25]: Only a clip because it won last week.

1246
01:41:45,068 --> 01:41:47,490
[SPEAKER_25]: Damon Albren with a rappy song.

1247
01:41:47,950 --> 01:41:50,852
[SPEAKER_25]: How appropriate considering the PSO blue burst I've been doing this week.

1248
01:41:51,152 --> 01:41:51,732
[SPEAKER_10]: All rappy.

1249
01:41:51,972 --> 01:41:52,312
[SPEAKER_25]: All right.

1250
01:41:53,053 --> 01:41:54,854
[SPEAKER_25]: Damon Albrin, a rappy song, the remix.

1251
01:41:54,954 --> 01:41:55,274
[SPEAKER_25]: Enjoy.

1252
01:41:55,294 --> 01:41:56,274
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1253
01:42:56,537 --> 01:42:58,221
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you for watching!

1254
01:43:41,758 --> 01:43:42,799
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you for watching!

1255
01:44:54,619 --> 01:44:56,702
[SPEAKER_25]: Correct me if I'm wrong, you've misplaced Loki's song.

1256
01:45:07,208 --> 01:45:07,628
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, shut up.

1257
01:45:07,648 --> 01:45:08,689
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright, so there it was.

1258
01:45:08,709 --> 01:45:11,491
[SPEAKER_25]: Song number one, Damon Auburn with a rappy song, the remix.

1259
01:45:11,791 --> 01:45:13,672
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, here we go into song number two tonight.

1260
01:45:13,752 --> 01:45:14,532
[SPEAKER_25]: It's my pick.

1261
01:45:15,073 --> 01:45:19,735
[SPEAKER_25]: And this comes off that same dance compilation that I've been putting songs from in lately.

1262
01:45:19,916 --> 01:45:21,116
[SPEAKER_25]: And Jamie's already rolling her eyes.

1263
01:45:21,396 --> 01:45:22,417
[SPEAKER_25]: But here's the weird thing.

1264
01:45:23,177 --> 01:45:25,519
[SPEAKER_25]: I believe this is actually Ayumi Hanasaki.

1265
01:45:26,255 --> 01:45:46,856
[SPEAKER_25]: Who showed up on this compilation If it sounds like she's holding her nose, then it is I think it is But she's simply being credited as IU And if it's not her, then it sure sounds like her So I'm picking this song because I like it The song is called Appears So here it is, IU with Appears And I'm going to refer to it as IU because that's the way it's credited on the CD So enjoy

1266
01:46:27,479 --> 01:46:29,000
Thank you for watching.

1267
01:46:29,020 --> 01:46:30,621
[SPEAKER_13]: See you next time.

1268
01:47:54,711 --> 01:47:57,895
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for watching.

1269
01:47:57,935 --> 01:47:58,816
[SPEAKER_13]: See you next time.

1270
01:49:33,380 --> 01:49:33,980
[SPEAKER_25]: I.U.

1271
01:49:34,060 --> 01:49:35,501
[SPEAKER_25]: with Appears.

1272
01:49:35,721 --> 01:49:37,181
[SPEAKER_25]: Definitely, definitely Ayumi Hamasaki.

1273
01:49:37,221 --> 01:49:37,902
[SPEAKER_25]: You can't argue that.

1274
01:49:38,242 --> 01:49:40,563
[SPEAKER_25]: So I don't know why they build her or something else in Europe, but whatever.

1275
01:49:40,663 --> 01:49:43,964
[SPEAKER_02]: Because her dance in Europe is put out as I.U.

1276
01:49:44,024 --> 01:49:45,744
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, that makes sense.

1277
01:49:46,265 --> 01:49:46,605
[SPEAKER_25]: All right.

1278
01:49:48,305 --> 01:49:49,065
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to rate them.

1279
01:49:49,086 --> 01:49:49,626
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, yeah, we have to.

1280
01:49:49,666 --> 01:49:50,406
[SPEAKER_25]: I was just going to move.

1281
01:49:50,766 --> 01:49:51,206
[SPEAKER_25]: Move on.

1282
01:49:51,846 --> 01:49:53,627
[SPEAKER_25]: Dear Rob, rate.

1283
01:49:53,907 --> 01:49:55,548
[SPEAKER_25]: DarkSakura, what did you think of that?

1284
01:49:57,048 --> 01:49:58,669
[SPEAKER_02]: Ayumi's voice annoys me.

1285
01:49:59,548 --> 01:50:01,029
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry because she's so nasally.

1286
01:50:01,569 --> 01:50:13,395
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really like a bunch of her stuff, and I really liked her for a while, but I can't get too excited about Ayumi Hamasaki just because she's been there, done that, you know.

1287
01:50:13,435 --> 01:50:14,236
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still solid.

1288
01:50:14,496 --> 01:50:15,957
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still trance.

1289
01:50:16,057 --> 01:50:16,697
[SPEAKER_02]: It gets a seven.

1290
01:50:18,358 --> 01:50:23,280
[SPEAKER_25]: I feel a little bit similar where I'm like, well, it's another Ayumi song, but God, I love her trance stuff.

1291
01:50:23,541 --> 01:50:25,221
[SPEAKER_25]: I just love those mixes.

1292
01:50:25,682 --> 01:50:26,442
[SPEAKER_25]: They make me happy.

1293
01:50:26,502 --> 01:50:27,082
[SPEAKER_25]: I give it a nine.

1294
01:50:27,703 --> 01:50:28,003
[SPEAKER_25]: All right.

1295
01:50:28,914 --> 01:50:29,835
[SPEAKER_25]: I know exactly what this is.

1296
01:50:29,855 --> 01:50:31,717
[SPEAKER_25]: I have no idea what to expect.

1297
01:50:31,737 --> 01:50:34,019
[SPEAKER_25]: Here it is, song number three, Loki's Gin and Juice, Ted Koppel.

1298
01:51:15,386 --> 01:51:25,633
[SPEAKER_12]: With so much drama in the ABC, it's kinda hard being Ted K.O.P., but I, somehow, someway, keep coming up with funky-ass shit like every single day.

1299
01:51:26,093 --> 01:51:32,137
[SPEAKER_12]: May I kick a little something for the G's and make a few N's as I breeze through.

1300
01:51:32,437 --> 01:51:35,839
[SPEAKER_12]: Two in the morning and the party's still jumping cause my mama ain't home.

1301
01:51:35,920 --> 01:51:41,183
[SPEAKER_12]: I got bitches in the living room getting it on, and they ain't leaving till six in the morning.

1302
01:51:41,974 --> 01:51:43,015
[SPEAKER_12]: So what you wanna do?

1303
01:51:43,195 --> 01:51:46,378
[SPEAKER_12]: Shit, I've got a pocket full of rubbers and my homeboys do too.

1304
01:51:47,099 --> 01:51:53,725
[SPEAKER_12]: So turn off the lights and close the doors, but... Yeah, so we gon' smoke an ounce to this.

1305
01:51:53,925 --> 01:51:57,268
[SPEAKER_12]: Jeez up, hose down while you motherfuckers bounce to this.

1306
01:52:00,592 --> 01:52:03,855
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm Ted Koppel and this is Laid Back.

1307
01:52:09,693 --> 01:52:15,196
[SPEAKER_12]: Sources close to the White House today confirm that the president is laid back.

1308
01:52:15,896 --> 01:52:21,459
[SPEAKER_12]: Now that I got me some Seagram's Gin, everybody got they cups, but they ain't chipped in.

1309
01:52:21,920 --> 01:52:24,121
[SPEAKER_12]: Now this types of shit happens all the time.

1310
01:52:24,161 --> 01:52:26,642
[SPEAKER_12]: You gotta get yours, but fool, I gotta get mine.

1311
01:52:27,042 --> 01:52:29,804
[SPEAKER_12]: Everything is fine when you're listening to the T.E.D.

1312
01:52:29,924 --> 01:52:33,426
[SPEAKER_12]: I got the cultivatin' music that be captivatin' he who listens.

1313
01:52:33,866 --> 01:52:39,769
[SPEAKER_12]: To the words that I speak as I take me a drink to the middle of the street and get to mackin' this bitch named Katie.

1314
01:52:39,789 --> 01:52:40,330
[SPEAKER_12]: Katie Curran?

1315
01:52:40,530 --> 01:52:42,231
[SPEAKER_12]: She used to be the homeboy's lady.

1316
01:52:42,351 --> 01:52:42,891
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, that bitch?

1317
01:52:43,311 --> 01:52:48,954
[SPEAKER_12]: Eighty degrees when I tell that bitch, please raise up off these NUTs cause you get none of these at ease.

1318
01:52:50,075 --> 01:52:53,817
[SPEAKER_12]: As I mob with the dog pound, feel the breeze, biatch, I'm just.

1319
01:52:56,298 --> 01:53:00,641
[SPEAKER_12]: Earthquakes rocked Tokyo, Japan today as residents were laid back.

1320
01:53:05,689 --> 01:53:11,118
[SPEAKER_12]: Residents in a small New England town are terrified as a mass murderer is laid back.

1321
01:53:11,158 --> 01:53:13,922
With my mind on the money and the money on the line.

1322
01:53:14,466 --> 01:53:22,933
[SPEAKER_12]: Later on that day, my homie Sam Donaldson came through with a gang of Tanqueray and a fat-ass J of some bubonic chronic that made me choke.

1323
01:53:23,053 --> 01:53:26,616
[SPEAKER_12]: Shit, this ain't no joke, I had to back up off of it and sit my cup down.

1324
01:53:27,056 --> 01:53:31,880
[SPEAKER_12]: Tanqueray and chronic, yeah, I'm fucked up now, but it ain't no stoppin', I'm still poppin'.

1325
01:53:32,200 --> 01:53:39,846
[SPEAKER_12]: Sam got some bitches from the city of Compton to serve me, not with a cherry on top, cause when I bust my nut, I'm raisin' up off the cot.

1326
01:53:40,166 --> 01:53:42,328
[SPEAKER_12]: But don't get upset, girl, that's just how it goes.

1327
01:53:42,388 --> 01:53:43,308
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't love you, hoes.

1328
01:53:43,368 --> 01:53:52,075
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm out the door, and I'll be... Residents of Baghdad fired shots wildly into the air as protesters were laid back.

1329
01:53:52,095 --> 01:53:53,295
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm Ted Koppel, and this is Laid Back.

1330
01:54:08,030 --> 01:54:09,371
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, now here's a question.

1331
01:54:09,531 --> 01:54:14,493
[SPEAKER_12]: What is the BH?

1332
01:54:14,913 --> 01:54:15,754
[SPEAKER_12]: Right, see, exactly.

1333
01:54:15,814 --> 01:54:17,835
[SPEAKER_12]: I just don't, I don't understand.

1334
01:54:17,875 --> 01:54:19,796
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't, I don't know what that word is.

1335
01:54:20,736 --> 01:54:22,057
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that, is that how it's pronounced?

1336
01:54:22,497 --> 01:54:23,417
[SPEAKER_12]: Right, yeah.

1337
01:54:23,837 --> 01:54:26,919
[SPEAKER_12]: I just, I, I just, I don't understand.

1338
01:54:36,570 --> 01:54:40,594
[SPEAKER_25]: Sound number three, Darth Punk, Ted Koppel's Gin and Juice.

1339
01:54:41,394 --> 01:54:44,037
[SPEAKER_25]: Juicy or not juicy?

1340
01:54:44,097 --> 01:54:45,518
[SPEAKER_02]: Juicy like a wet fart.

1341
01:54:46,439 --> 01:54:47,680
[SPEAKER_25]: What'd you think, DarkSakura?

1342
01:54:47,840 --> 01:54:51,183
[SPEAKER_02]: The first time I heard that, I thought it was intensely retarded.

1343
01:54:51,484 --> 01:54:54,186
[SPEAKER_02]: He wanted me to put it as a fortune cookie, and I refused to.

1344
01:54:55,688 --> 01:54:57,389
[SPEAKER_02]: So it gets a big whopping .5.

1345
01:54:59,583 --> 01:55:25,228
[SPEAKER_25]: Just cause I like how he does the blah blah blah blah and leaves back Cause I thought that part was funny You know, Loki played that for me too, saying it was like the funniest thing he'd ever heard And I was like, this is not the funniest thing I've ever heard Jokes that Diane Mita Zoda makes on G4 can be funnier than this, I'm sorry If you're gonna be funny and do a parody song, be funny I give that song a zero, it's awful

1346
01:55:26,167 --> 01:55:27,688
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright, let's recap.

1347
01:55:27,728 --> 01:55:29,849
[SPEAKER_25]: But it's not up to us, it's up to you guys.

1348
01:55:29,909 --> 01:55:30,889
[SPEAKER_25]: Maybe you thought it was funny.

1349
01:55:31,450 --> 01:55:31,850
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know.

1350
01:55:32,370 --> 01:55:34,991
[SPEAKER_25]: So here it is, the three songs you get to vote for tonight.

1351
01:55:35,091 --> 01:55:39,093
[SPEAKER_25]: Song number one, Damon Albrin, a rappy song.

1352
01:55:39,354 --> 01:55:39,874
[SPEAKER_25]: The remix.

1353
01:55:47,057 --> 01:55:50,119
[SPEAKER_25]: And song number two you can vote for tonight is IU with Appears.

1354
01:55:59,349 --> 01:56:03,672
[SPEAKER_25]: and song number three you can vote for tonight, Darth Punk, Ted Koppel's Gin and Juice.

1355
01:56:07,475 --> 01:56:12,139
[SPEAKER_12]: George is close to the White House today, confirmed that the president is laid back.

1356
01:56:12,859 --> 01:56:14,541
[SPEAKER_25]: There, I got a laid back in there for you, Jamie.

1357
01:56:14,701 --> 01:56:15,461
[SPEAKER_25]: I liked that one.

1358
01:56:15,501 --> 01:56:17,343
[SPEAKER_25]: That's all I like about the song.

1359
01:56:17,383 --> 01:56:19,344
[SPEAKER_25]: Place vote now.

1360
01:56:19,445 --> 01:56:22,787
[SPEAKER_25]: Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.

1361
01:56:22,847 --> 01:56:23,428
[SPEAKER_25]: Hurry, hurry.

1362
01:56:23,468 --> 01:56:25,529
[SPEAKER_25]: We'll add him up and let you know who the winner is.

1363
01:56:26,390 --> 01:56:26,470
[SPEAKER_25]: Um...

1364
01:56:27,404 --> 01:56:27,944
[SPEAKER_25]: You know what?

1365
01:56:28,004 --> 01:56:33,086
[SPEAKER_25]: He sounds like... You remember the two Muppets that sat up in the balcony and made fun of all the other Muppets on the Muppet Show?

1366
01:56:33,527 --> 01:56:34,667
[SPEAKER_25]: That's what he sounds like in that.

1367
01:56:34,987 --> 01:56:37,288
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it's... Laid back!

1368
01:56:39,889 --> 01:56:42,890
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah.

1369
01:56:44,691 --> 01:56:45,811
[SPEAKER_25]: Don't vote for Holic.

1370
01:56:45,911 --> 01:56:48,012
[SPEAKER_25]: Votes for Holic are thrown out, okay?

1371
01:56:48,993 --> 01:56:51,134
[SPEAKER_25]: There's always a movement in the chatroom to vote for Holic.

1372
01:56:51,454 --> 01:56:56,996
[SPEAKER_25]: Remember, the winning song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio.

1373
01:56:57,611 --> 01:57:01,374
[SPEAKER_25]: Holic is in permanent rotation already on Orange Lounge Radio.

1374
01:57:01,654 --> 01:57:03,556
[SPEAKER_25]: You don't need to vote it into rotation.

1375
01:57:03,656 --> 01:57:04,357
[SPEAKER_25]: It does no good.

1376
01:57:06,599 --> 01:57:07,720
[SPEAKER_25]: Just wanted to make that clear.

1377
01:57:08,580 --> 01:57:16,467
[SPEAKER_25]: I realize some of you like to vote for Holic when you feel that the rest of our songs were crappy or something like that, but just deal.

1378
01:57:18,146 --> 01:57:25,068
[SPEAKER_25]: Anyway, this is the part of the show where Loki would typically give us the sim scene update and tell us what's going on in the sim scene.

1379
01:57:25,489 --> 01:57:28,570
[SPEAKER_25]: However, I have no idea what's going on in the sim scene right now.

1380
01:57:29,130 --> 01:57:33,471
[SPEAKER_25]: A bunch of stuff happened, but not really, because it's sims.

1381
01:57:33,571 --> 01:57:41,254
[SPEAKER_25]: I'll bet you what, probably this lawsuit has people freaked out about making any sims right now.

1382
01:57:41,934 --> 01:57:45,416
[SPEAKER_25]: A bunch of crappy Max remixes were released on Mamani Style, what can I say?

1383
01:57:47,529 --> 01:57:47,929
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no.

1384
01:57:48,029 --> 01:57:54,392
[SPEAKER_02]: ParanoiaMax.5007 Let's talk about the real thing, shall we?

1385
01:57:54,412 --> 01:57:55,132
[SPEAKER_25]: The real deal.

1386
01:57:55,172 --> 01:57:55,812
[SPEAKER_25]: The real thing.

1387
01:57:56,833 --> 01:57:58,013
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, in the groove.

1388
01:57:58,173 --> 01:57:58,574
[SPEAKER_25]: No, no, no.

1389
01:57:58,774 --> 01:57:59,514
[SPEAKER_25]: Even better than that.

1390
01:57:59,954 --> 01:58:04,116
[SPEAKER_25]: Konami has launched something on their website.

1391
01:58:04,256 --> 01:58:09,898
[SPEAKER_25]: And what it is, it is a teaser pic for a brand new DDR.

1392
01:58:10,038 --> 01:58:16,481
[SPEAKER_25]: And you can see it on our website at www.orangeloungeradio.com And in this video it appears to have...

1393
01:58:17,188 --> 01:58:19,510
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm sorry, not a video, sorry, a picture.

1394
01:58:19,610 --> 01:58:23,253
[SPEAKER_25]: It appears to have maybe some captures from new videos or something.

1395
01:58:23,953 --> 01:58:26,255
[SPEAKER_25]: But it does indicate that a new DDR is coming out.

1396
01:58:26,575 --> 01:58:29,677
[SPEAKER_25]: However, in the corner, it says it's coming out on PlayStation 2.

1397
01:58:30,358 --> 01:58:33,000
[SPEAKER_25]: So I think people got excited at first that this is a new arcade mix.

1398
01:58:33,620 --> 01:58:34,340
[SPEAKER_25]: It doesn't look like it.

1399
01:58:34,381 --> 01:58:39,985
[SPEAKER_25]: This is probably Japan's version of whatever we're getting with Xtreme 2.

1400
01:58:40,305 --> 01:58:43,167
[SPEAKER_25]: Such as Festival was like our DDR Xtreme.

1401
01:58:43,860 --> 01:58:47,161
[SPEAKER_25]: This is probably their version of what we're going to get as Xtreme 2.

1402
01:58:49,522 --> 01:58:52,322
[SPEAKER_25]: And of course, we talked about Xtreme 2 a little bit last week.

1403
01:58:52,503 --> 01:58:53,863
[SPEAKER_25]: EyeToy stuff coming back.

1404
01:58:55,783 --> 01:59:00,685
[SPEAKER_25]: It's going to have the Oops I Did It Again rumored online play and all that fun stuff.

1405
01:59:00,705 --> 01:59:02,205
[SPEAKER_25]: We'll know more, of course, next week.

1406
01:59:03,746 --> 01:59:10,648
[SPEAKER_25]: It doesn't seem like any big surprise that this would be ported to Japan as well and be coming out there.

1407
01:59:11,128 --> 01:59:11,208
[SPEAKER_25]: Or

1408
01:59:11,894 --> 01:59:15,324
[SPEAKER_25]: Maybe we're getting the port, it's hard to say, but no surprise, really.

1409
01:59:15,825 --> 01:59:19,035
[SPEAKER_25]: Things you would like to see in the next PlayStation release of DDR, Jamie, anything?

1410
01:59:20,618 --> 01:59:25,580
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't really say, you know, because the one thing I wanted was freaking Dance Magic.

1411
01:59:26,141 --> 01:59:27,721
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want Dance Magic mode to come back.

1412
01:59:28,161 --> 01:59:42,608
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, you know what, and what you almost kind of said, is that In The Groove has a mode like that, although not as many people play it as you'd think, and it was going to be in the home release and everything, and now it's not, well, we don't know yet, but now it's questionable if it's coming or not.

1413
01:59:44,569 --> 01:59:46,870
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know...

1414
01:59:48,015 --> 01:59:50,577
[SPEAKER_02]: DDR doesn't make you a better dancer, so that's one thing out, you know.

1415
01:59:54,559 --> 02:00:00,562
[SPEAKER_02]: I really can't think of anything else that they could really... There's that, you know, dinky little RPG mode thing, right?

1416
02:00:01,683 --> 02:00:02,383
[SPEAKER_25]: That's in Ultramix 3.

1417
02:00:02,423 --> 02:00:03,484
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Ultramix 3.

1418
02:00:04,344 --> 02:00:06,866
[SPEAKER_25]: No, I can't... I really hope they're demoing that.

1419
02:00:06,926 --> 02:00:08,127
[SPEAKER_02]: DDR Whack-A-Mole!

1420
02:00:09,487 --> 02:00:12,889
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, that would be... They need to put DDR Whack-A-Mole in.

1421
02:00:13,830 --> 02:00:15,591
[SPEAKER_25]: Wouldn't the makers of Spider Stomps sue him?

1422
02:00:16,912 --> 02:00:18,453
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's not really whack-a-mole.

1423
02:00:18,533 --> 02:00:20,053
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, because it's moles and not spiders.

1424
02:00:20,514 --> 02:00:22,154
[SPEAKER_02]: And they don't pop up out of the ground.

1425
02:00:22,635 --> 02:00:30,278
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're actually stepping on the thing itself, but there's no TV on Spider Stump either.

1426
02:00:30,358 --> 02:00:31,098
[SPEAKER_02]: So, aha!

1427
02:00:31,419 --> 02:00:32,659
[SPEAKER_02]: I know my legal crap.

1428
02:00:32,739 --> 02:00:33,720
[SPEAKER_25]: It's in a different cabinet.

1429
02:00:35,260 --> 02:00:36,401
[SPEAKER_02]: No infringement there, no?

1430
02:00:37,461 --> 02:00:37,981
[SPEAKER_25]: Not at all.

1431
02:00:39,262 --> 02:00:40,403
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, um...

1432
02:00:42,012 --> 02:00:43,833
[SPEAKER_25]: Loki popped into chat really fast.

1433
02:00:43,873 --> 02:00:47,455
[SPEAKER_25]: I guess he managed to tear himself away for a little bit to listen to the little show.

1434
02:00:47,495 --> 02:00:47,835
[SPEAKER_25]: Hi.

1435
02:00:49,196 --> 02:00:54,139
[SPEAKER_25]: He says, and I quote, nothing much is happening in the sim scene, just more crappy sim files.

1436
02:00:54,599 --> 02:00:55,360
[SPEAKER_25]: See, I called it.

1437
02:00:56,020 --> 02:01:00,063
[SPEAKER_25]: You know what, we ought to just fire Loki because I'm able to do the sim scene report myself every week.

1438
02:01:00,543 --> 02:01:01,023
[SPEAKER_25]: No, I'm kidding.

1439
02:01:01,103 --> 02:01:01,764
[SPEAKER_25]: We would never do that.

1440
02:01:02,404 --> 02:01:03,164
[SPEAKER_25]: He'll be back next week.

1441
02:01:03,224 --> 02:01:04,665
[SPEAKER_25]: He'll be with us for the podcast as well.

1442
02:01:06,366 --> 02:01:08,988
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright, last call for the cage match votes, you guys.

1443
02:01:09,028 --> 02:01:09,628
[SPEAKER_25]: Get them in here.

1444
02:01:10,849 --> 02:01:10,929
[SPEAKER_25]: Um,

1445
02:01:11,431 --> 02:01:17,614
[SPEAKER_25]: Also, what we're going to do next break, I think we're going to try and do that list list, except my roommate is getting cold feet now.

1446
02:01:17,654 --> 02:01:18,375
[SPEAKER_25]: He doesn't want to do it.

1447
02:01:18,815 --> 02:01:23,838
[SPEAKER_02]: So how about we have two, we can't do two Skype lines, can we?

1448
02:01:23,858 --> 02:01:24,898
[SPEAKER_25]: No, we'll just have three people.

1449
02:01:24,918 --> 02:01:26,219
[SPEAKER_25]: We'll do a three-person list.

1450
02:01:26,319 --> 02:01:30,801
[SPEAKER_02]: One person in PM and one person on Skype line.

1451
02:01:30,842 --> 02:01:32,963
[SPEAKER_25]: So one person in private message and one person on Skype line.

1452
02:01:32,983 --> 02:01:34,704
[SPEAKER_25]: All right, I'll try to figure out who those people are going to be.

1453
02:01:35,024 --> 02:01:36,565
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm picking people I want.

1454
02:01:37,185 --> 02:01:37,905
[SPEAKER_02]: Trivia question.

1455
02:01:38,065 --> 02:01:38,706
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an easy one.

1456
02:01:38,926 --> 02:01:39,146
[SPEAKER_25]: All right.

1457
02:01:40,410 --> 02:01:41,411
[SPEAKER_02]: Who is my favorite?

1458
02:01:41,571 --> 02:01:41,871
[SPEAKER_25]: No, no, no.

1459
02:01:42,011 --> 02:01:42,391
[SPEAKER_25]: No, no, no.

1460
02:01:42,871 --> 02:01:43,652
[SPEAKER_25]: No question.

1461
02:01:43,672 --> 02:01:44,752
[SPEAKER_25]: I want to pick up people who are doing it.

1462
02:01:45,173 --> 02:01:45,753
[SPEAKER_02]: If that's okay.

1463
02:01:45,933 --> 02:01:46,613
[SPEAKER_02]: No, seriously.

1464
02:01:46,653 --> 02:01:48,474
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that we should give a fair opportunity.

1465
02:01:48,914 --> 02:01:49,315
[SPEAKER_25]: All right.

1466
02:01:49,355 --> 02:01:52,756
[SPEAKER_25]: How about we Skype in somebody I want and we'll let somebody from the chat room do it?

1467
02:01:52,776 --> 02:01:52,897
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1468
02:01:53,057 --> 02:01:54,217
[SPEAKER_02]: So the trivia question... Wait, wait, wait.

1469
02:01:54,317 --> 02:01:56,458
[SPEAKER_25]: Don't give the trivia question yet because I'm still... Well, I want them to think about it.

1470
02:01:56,478 --> 02:01:57,639
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm telling you in cage match votes.

1471
02:01:57,679 --> 02:01:58,900
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't want them to send it in yet.

1472
02:01:59,060 --> 02:01:59,280
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay.

1473
02:01:59,300 --> 02:02:00,741
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, don't... All right.

1474
02:02:05,285 --> 02:02:06,165
[SPEAKER_25]: Hold on, I'll finish up.

1475
02:02:06,445 --> 02:02:07,746
[SPEAKER_25]: Any thoughts you have for us, Jamie?

1476
02:02:07,766 --> 02:02:10,607
[SPEAKER_25]: Why don't you tell us about some of the spit-off programming we have here on Orange Lounge Radio?

1477
02:02:11,067 --> 02:02:14,888
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, on Monday, we happen to have Diversion that starts at a net moon time to me.

1478
02:02:15,329 --> 02:02:15,769
[SPEAKER_02]: Seven o'clock.

1479
02:02:16,129 --> 02:02:17,509
[SPEAKER_25]: Actually, Diversion got cancelled.

1480
02:02:17,930 --> 02:02:18,330
What?

1481
02:02:18,770 --> 02:02:19,730
[SPEAKER_02]: Diversion's cancelled, remember?

1482
02:02:19,750 --> 02:02:20,691
[SPEAKER_02]: You didn't tell me this stuff.

1483
02:02:20,991 --> 02:02:21,311
[SPEAKER_25]: Sorry.

1484
02:02:22,331 --> 02:02:24,372
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what I get for sleeping through a board meeting.

1485
02:02:25,152 --> 02:02:25,912
[SPEAKER_25]: Fuck.

1486
02:02:26,193 --> 02:02:30,874
[SPEAKER_25]: Coming soon to Orange Lounge Radio, the Dance Mania show is coming to Monday nights to replace Diversion.

1487
02:02:30,914 --> 02:02:31,074
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes.

1488
02:02:36,087 --> 02:02:37,907
[SPEAKER_28]: You better drink Diet Coke.

1489
02:02:59,192 --> 02:03:05,640
[SPEAKER_02]: The actual show will start at 7.30 and the concept is requesting stuff but people don't request shit so I just end up playing whatever.

1490
02:03:06,821 --> 02:03:10,285
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course no show this week because I will again be in a car on my way to E3.

1491
02:03:10,746 --> 02:03:16,473
[SPEAKER_02]: However, I will be coming back and uh

1492
02:03:17,779 --> 02:03:21,922
[SPEAKER_02]: Filling your head with, I think, an anime marathon, I'm thinking this time.

1493
02:03:22,443 --> 02:03:33,451
[SPEAKER_02]: The last time, see, I've noticed that my pre-shows have been turning into sort of repeat performances of what you might hear on Pump Up the Volume.

1494
02:03:33,591 --> 02:03:36,373
[SPEAKER_02]: So, if you like what you hear on the pre-show, be sure to tune in.

1495
02:03:37,782 --> 02:03:39,163
[SPEAKER_25]: All right, let's do the cage match winner.

1496
02:03:39,363 --> 02:03:39,643
[SPEAKER_25]: You ready?

1497
02:03:39,663 --> 02:03:40,563
[SPEAKER_28]: We don't have another show.

1498
02:03:40,723 --> 02:03:42,464
[SPEAKER_25]: No, we don't have another show right now.

1499
02:03:42,744 --> 02:03:43,785
[SPEAKER_25]: It's just me.

1500
02:03:43,885 --> 02:03:45,765
[SPEAKER_25]: It's the Jamie show.

1501
02:03:45,825 --> 02:03:48,907
[SPEAKER_25]: Jamie's by herself, and then we're going to have a whole lot of new programming at the end of the month.

1502
02:03:49,047 --> 02:03:49,487
[SPEAKER_25]: I promise.

1503
02:03:49,627 --> 02:03:51,768
[SPEAKER_02]: But I still love you, and I will stay constant.

1504
02:03:51,988 --> 02:03:52,368
[SPEAKER_25]: All right.

1505
02:03:53,289 --> 02:03:54,069
[SPEAKER_25]: I, however, do not.

1506
02:03:54,689 --> 02:03:55,270
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, here we go.

1507
02:03:55,810 --> 02:03:57,771
[SPEAKER_25]: The winning song of tonight's cage match.

1508
02:03:58,231 --> 02:03:58,571
[SPEAKER_25]: You ready?

1509
02:03:59,371 --> 02:04:01,972
[SPEAKER_25]: Tonight's winning song is... A tie.

1510
02:04:03,713 --> 02:04:05,514
[SPEAKER_25]: Song number one that tied in tonight's cage match.

1511
02:04:08,078 --> 02:04:09,038
[SPEAKER_25]: IU appears.

1512
02:04:10,879 --> 02:04:12,740
[SPEAKER_25]: Kind of a given considering the crowd we got here.

1513
02:04:12,800 --> 02:04:14,861
[SPEAKER_25]: Song number three that tied in tonight's cage match.

1514
02:04:17,082 --> 02:04:19,683
[SPEAKER_12]: What the fuck?

1515
02:04:19,803 --> 02:04:20,183
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

1516
02:04:20,703 --> 02:04:21,863
[SPEAKER_25]: Ted Koppel's Gin and Juice.

1517
02:04:21,883 --> 02:04:30,007
[SPEAKER_25]: Before you say anything, Jamie, let me remind folks, in case of a tie, the host whose song did not make the tie gets to break the tie.

1518
02:04:30,067 --> 02:04:32,668
[SPEAKER_25]: That being said, Jamie, tough decision here.

1519
02:04:32,908 --> 02:04:33,648
[SPEAKER_24]: What are you going to go with?

1520
02:04:47,159 --> 02:04:48,380
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to torture you.

1521
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:51,801
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to see you crack and bleeding under my whip.

1522
02:04:52,422 --> 02:04:53,442
[SPEAKER_02]: You get Ted Koppel.

1523
02:04:55,643 --> 02:04:57,104
[SPEAKER_25]: Jamie votes for Ted Koppel.

1524
02:04:57,204 --> 02:04:58,844
[SPEAKER_12]: I cannot believe that the song you gave a .5

1525
02:05:08,715 --> 02:05:09,235
[SPEAKER_25]: The demon is hot.

1526
02:05:21,656 --> 02:05:23,077
[SPEAKER_25]: Dude, he's older and still hot.

1527
02:05:23,258 --> 02:05:26,040
[SPEAKER_25]: Dude, you lucked out with that win last week.

1528
02:05:27,101 --> 02:05:30,745
[SPEAKER_25]: Even you have to admit, considering the chatroom's reaction, you lucked out with that win last week.

1529
02:05:31,646 --> 02:05:41,135
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but I have to make sure that I put in a song that won't win next week because the week after is the week after.

1530
02:05:41,655 --> 02:05:43,277
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, that was a strategic vote.

1531
02:05:43,317 --> 02:05:44,197
[SPEAKER_25]: That's what you were doing.

1532
02:05:44,237 --> 02:05:45,739
[SPEAKER_25]: You did that so that you could win next week.

1533
02:05:46,511 --> 02:05:53,374
[SPEAKER_02]: But I did want to make an announcement because I think I can legally get away with it as I'm going to be playing the entirety of Demon Days on the 23rd.

1534
02:05:53,994 --> 02:05:55,535
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it will have been released in the UK.

1535
02:05:57,076 --> 02:05:57,436
[SPEAKER_25]: Super.

1536
02:06:01,478 --> 02:06:03,338
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't get you, Jamie, by the way.

1537
02:06:03,378 --> 02:06:05,319
[SPEAKER_02]: I am a woman!

1538
02:06:06,660 --> 02:06:09,161
[SPEAKER_25]: And by rights... Alright, woman, I don't get you.

1539
02:06:09,801 --> 02:06:14,783
[SPEAKER_02]: I can change my mind and do everything I can to confuse men.

1540
02:06:15,144 --> 02:06:15,784
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright, I'm done.

1541
02:06:16,992 --> 02:06:18,193
[SPEAKER_25]: Um, here we go.

1542
02:06:18,213 --> 02:06:19,734
[SPEAKER_25]: The power of estrogen.

1543
02:06:19,774 --> 02:06:20,695
[SPEAKER_25]: Let's, list, list.

1544
02:06:21,456 --> 02:06:25,459
[SPEAKER_25]: Let's remind... Shut up.

1545
02:06:26,380 --> 02:06:26,800
[SPEAKER_25]: List, list.

1546
02:06:27,200 --> 02:06:27,661
[SPEAKER_10]: Make me!

1547
02:06:28,888 --> 02:06:37,475
[SPEAKER_25]: The way this list works, we are going to come up with the definitive list of things for Orange Lounge Radio to stick on the E3 Katamari.

1548
02:06:37,575 --> 02:06:38,996
[SPEAKER_25]: The definitive list, okay?

1549
02:06:39,297 --> 02:06:51,407
[SPEAKER_25]: The way it works, myself, Jamie, and two mystery guests will be coming up with a list of four items each, and then we each take one off the list.

1550
02:06:51,467 --> 02:06:53,669
[SPEAKER_25]: And you guys get to vote on the definitive list.

1551
02:06:53,689 --> 02:06:54,990
[SPEAKER_25]: We'll explain it as we move on.

1552
02:06:56,130 --> 02:06:59,511
[SPEAKER_25]: In order for us to get to that point, though, we need a contestant from chat.

1553
02:07:00,151 --> 02:07:01,311
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm going to get somebody on Skype.

1554
02:07:01,371 --> 02:07:03,311
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm going to handpick one of our guests to get on Skype.

1555
02:07:04,111 --> 02:07:07,072
[SPEAKER_25]: But we are going to have a contest in the chat room to see who gets in there.

1556
02:07:07,092 --> 02:07:11,013
[SPEAKER_25]: So the first person to answer this correctly is going to be doing the other list.

1557
02:07:11,313 --> 02:07:15,953
[SPEAKER_25]: But please don't answer unless you have some ideas for this list list, because I don't want you sitting there going, I don't know.

1558
02:07:16,194 --> 02:07:16,774
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll tell you what.

1559
02:07:17,194 --> 02:07:20,594
[SPEAKER_02]: Send the PM to me so that Rob is not inundated with PMs.

1560
02:07:20,774 --> 02:07:21,214
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, thank you.

1561
02:07:21,414 --> 02:07:23,215
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm in the chat room at DarkSakura SSF.

1562
02:07:23,575 --> 02:07:24,235
[SPEAKER_02]: The question...

1563
02:07:25,265 --> 02:07:27,207
[SPEAKER_02]: Who is my favorite member of Gorillaz?

1564
02:07:27,247 --> 02:07:29,749
[SPEAKER_02]: Who is my favorite member of the band?

1565
02:07:40,717 --> 02:07:42,998
[SPEAKER_25]: Favorite member of the animated band Gorillaz.

1566
02:07:43,059 --> 02:07:45,440
[SPEAKER_25]: If you've been paying attention to this show in the past few weeks, you should know.

1567
02:07:45,680 --> 02:07:50,183
[SPEAKER_25]: First person to send that correctly over private message to Jamie will get the privilege.

1568
02:07:50,743 --> 02:07:52,304
[SPEAKER_25]: Listeners never get this privilege.

1569
02:07:52,625 --> 02:07:53,525
[SPEAKER_25]: This is a special night.

1570
02:07:53,545 --> 02:07:54,566
[SPEAKER_25]: You're lucky Loki's not here.

1571
02:07:54,946 --> 02:07:56,807
[SPEAKER_25]: To participate in Listless with us.

1572
02:07:56,847 --> 02:07:58,648
[SPEAKER_25]: Meanwhile, I'm going to hook up somebody over Skype.

1573
02:07:58,728 --> 02:08:00,229
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm going to find somebody on Skype.

1574
02:08:00,770 --> 02:08:07,594
[SPEAKER_25]: And we will be back after this featuring some music from... Well, more potpourri, I think.

1575
02:08:07,614 --> 02:08:09,035
[SPEAKER_25]: But we're going to start it off with Burning Heat.

1576
02:08:10,168 --> 02:08:12,170
[SPEAKER_25]: Because that song, Gin and Juice, gives me burning heat.

1577
02:08:13,312 --> 02:08:14,393
[SPEAKER_03]: Gives me burning itch.

1578
02:08:14,573 --> 02:08:15,154
[SPEAKER_25]: All right, here we go.

1579
02:08:15,174 --> 02:08:15,875
[SPEAKER_25]: We'll be back after this.

1580
02:09:16,460 --> 02:09:17,822
Thanks for watching!

1581
02:10:00,970 --> 02:10:01,871
Thanks for watching!

1582
02:11:42,225 --> 02:11:46,647
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm finding it hard to believe we're in heaven.

1583
02:14:23,385 --> 02:14:27,412
[SPEAKER_13]: Days when I couldn't live my life without you

1584
02:14:53,407 --> 02:14:53,827
[SPEAKER_25]: Hello?

1585
02:14:54,628 --> 02:14:55,628
[SPEAKER_25]: Hello, is this thing on?

1586
02:14:55,689 --> 02:14:56,209
[SPEAKER_25]: Testing.

1587
02:14:57,390 --> 02:14:58,250
[SPEAKER_25]: Testing, one, two.

1588
02:14:58,831 --> 02:15:02,793
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking in the index, but I don't see anything for how to run a radio show.

1589
02:15:02,893 --> 02:15:03,354
[SPEAKER_25]: Hello?

1590
02:15:04,034 --> 02:15:05,495
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't understand this.

1591
02:15:05,515 --> 02:15:06,876
[SPEAKER_03]: Does this thing work?

1592
02:15:06,896 --> 02:15:08,497
[SPEAKER_03]: This thing reads like stereo instructions.

1593
02:15:08,557 --> 02:15:09,178
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this on?

1594
02:15:09,198 --> 02:15:09,778
[SPEAKER_03]: What the hell?

1595
02:15:12,340 --> 02:15:16,102
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge Radio, broke down ghetto Bomani Radio.

1596
02:15:16,122 --> 02:15:16,723
[SPEAKER_13]: What the f***?

1597
02:15:19,844 --> 02:15:26,026
[SPEAKER_25]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, and we are going to do some listless.

1598
02:15:26,786 --> 02:15:27,526
[SPEAKER_25]: Yay!

1599
02:15:28,567 --> 02:15:31,127
[SPEAKER_25]: So, the way listless works, just a quick reminder.

1600
02:15:33,348 --> 02:15:34,268
[SPEAKER_25]: We're doing three, just three.

1601
02:15:34,608 --> 02:15:41,110
[SPEAKER_25]: We are each going to pick our top three, myself, DarkSakura, and who is your winner, DarkSakura?

1602
02:15:41,350 --> 02:15:42,911
[SPEAKER_02]: Our winner is Ranma!

1603
02:15:43,031 --> 02:15:45,992
[SPEAKER_25]: Ranma, okay, and then we're going to get somebody special here on the Skype line right now.

1604
02:15:48,193 --> 02:15:49,633
[SPEAKER_25]: Doop-a-doop-a-doo, just waiting for the phone.

1605
02:15:51,511 --> 02:15:52,131
[SPEAKER_25]: One ringy dingy.

1606
02:15:52,291 --> 02:15:52,692
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello?

1607
02:15:53,112 --> 02:15:53,612
[SPEAKER_25]: Hello?

1608
02:15:54,072 --> 02:15:55,333
[SPEAKER_25]: Is this Miklatov?

1609
02:15:57,494 --> 02:15:57,934
[SPEAKER_25]: Hello?

1610
02:15:58,054 --> 02:15:58,955
[SPEAKER_25]: Hello, Miklatov?

1611
02:16:00,315 --> 02:16:00,895
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah?

1612
02:16:01,016 --> 02:16:01,576
[SPEAKER_25]: Can you hear me?

1613
02:16:06,098 --> 02:16:06,878
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know if he can hear me.

1614
02:16:07,178 --> 02:16:07,599
[SPEAKER_25]: Are you there?

1615
02:16:08,619 --> 02:16:09,239
[SPEAKER_08]: I can hear you.

1616
02:16:09,920 --> 02:16:11,360
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, but you can't hear yourself?

1617
02:16:13,721 --> 02:16:14,042
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

1618
02:16:14,442 --> 02:16:15,422
[SPEAKER_08]: What are you talking about?

1619
02:16:15,562 --> 02:16:16,343
[SPEAKER_25]: Can you hear me?

1620
02:16:16,643 --> 02:16:17,603
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm confused.

1621
02:16:17,943 --> 02:16:18,984
[SPEAKER_02]: He can hear us.

1622
02:16:19,664 --> 02:16:20,505
[SPEAKER_02]: We can hear him.

1623
02:16:20,565 --> 02:16:21,085
[SPEAKER_02]: We're good.

1624
02:16:21,753 --> 02:16:22,453
[SPEAKER_08]: I can hear you.

1625
02:16:22,653 --> 02:16:23,213
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, good.

1626
02:16:24,234 --> 02:16:24,654
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, good.

1627
02:16:25,094 --> 02:16:26,775
[SPEAKER_25]: You just freaked me out for a little bit there.

1628
02:16:26,915 --> 02:16:27,295
[SPEAKER_25]: Damn.

1629
02:16:27,555 --> 02:16:27,895
[SPEAKER_25]: All right.

1630
02:16:28,915 --> 02:16:29,375
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.

1631
02:16:29,735 --> 02:16:30,316
[SPEAKER_25]: That's all right.

1632
02:16:30,516 --> 02:16:31,236
[SPEAKER_25]: How are you doing, sir?

1633
02:16:32,436 --> 02:16:33,317
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm doing pretty well.

1634
02:16:33,657 --> 02:16:35,897
[SPEAKER_25]: Looking forward to E3 next week?

1635
02:16:38,518 --> 02:16:39,018
[SPEAKER_08]: To what?

1636
02:16:39,238 --> 02:16:41,159
[SPEAKER_25]: Are you looking forward to E3 next week?

1637
02:16:42,499 --> 02:16:42,699
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1638
02:16:43,400 --> 02:16:45,380
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay.

1639
02:16:45,880 --> 02:16:48,081
[SPEAKER_08]: You're breaking up because you're on the computer.

1640
02:16:48,401 --> 02:16:48,661
[SPEAKER_25]: Hold on.

1641
02:16:49,141 --> 02:16:49,721
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, I'm sorry.

1642
02:16:49,822 --> 02:16:50,022
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1643
02:16:50,382 --> 02:16:51,362
[SPEAKER_08]: Now I think I can hear you better.

1644
02:16:51,590 --> 02:16:52,692
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, there you go.

1645
02:16:54,434 --> 02:16:56,056
[SPEAKER_25]: Are you going to stick things on the Katamari?

1646
02:16:57,538 --> 02:16:57,738
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1647
02:16:58,038 --> 02:16:59,060
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, good.

1648
02:16:59,100 --> 02:16:59,761
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully we will.

1649
02:16:59,981 --> 02:17:00,261
[SPEAKER_25]: All right.

1650
02:17:00,522 --> 02:17:03,806
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, we're going to get your top three, but you have to wait your turn.

1651
02:17:03,846 --> 02:17:04,727
[SPEAKER_25]: So you have your list ready?

1652
02:17:05,608 --> 02:17:06,089
[SPEAKER_08]: It's my turn?

1653
02:17:06,429 --> 02:17:07,350
[SPEAKER_25]: No, it's not your turn yet.

1654
02:17:08,251 --> 02:17:08,972
[SPEAKER_25]: I'll let you know when.

1655
02:17:08,992 --> 02:17:10,915
[SPEAKER_25]: You're going to give us your answers, okay?

1656
02:17:10,935 --> 02:17:11,015
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay.

1657
02:17:12,421 --> 02:17:12,882
[SPEAKER_25]: VOTE ONE OFF

1658
02:17:31,539 --> 02:17:38,723
[SPEAKER_25]: So then after each one song has been voted off, we will have a list of eight, because we'll have two from each person left.

1659
02:17:39,003 --> 02:17:45,247
[SPEAKER_25]: We'll have a list of eight, and then the chat room gets to vote on their favorite to come up with a top three list.

1660
02:17:45,567 --> 02:17:46,468
[SPEAKER_25]: So tonight's list list...

1661
02:17:47,395 --> 02:17:54,057
[SPEAKER_25]: Things we want to stick on the Katamari at E3, or should I say things we should stick on the Katamari at E3.

1662
02:17:54,417 --> 02:17:55,177
[SPEAKER_25]: I'll go first.

1663
02:17:55,757 --> 02:17:59,698
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm actually stealing ideas from the chat room tonight because I think they actually have some decent ideas.

1664
02:18:00,178 --> 02:18:08,200
[SPEAKER_25]: And my number three pick is Calamari, as somebody said, because I think the phrase sticking Calamari on the Katamari, it's kind of cute.

1665
02:18:08,460 --> 02:18:12,001
[SPEAKER_25]: And it sounds like it actually could be a song in Katamari Damacy 2.

1666
02:18:12,521 --> 02:18:14,082
[SPEAKER_25]: So I'm saying Calamari.

1667
02:18:15,402 --> 02:18:15,682
[SPEAKER_25]: All right.

1668
02:18:17,506 --> 02:18:22,268
[SPEAKER_25]: Miklatov, what's your number three pick for things that you want to stick on the Katamari?

1669
02:18:24,009 --> 02:18:31,452
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I would like to put Mad Catz on the Katamari, just so it could be rolled away and shot off into space so they don't have anything to do with Pump It Up.

1670
02:18:32,332 --> 02:18:36,634
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, so he's going to stick the entire company of Mad Catz.

1671
02:18:36,654 --> 02:18:37,174
[SPEAKER_08]: All of Mad Catz.

1672
02:18:37,294 --> 02:18:38,334
[SPEAKER_08]: All of Mad Catz.

1673
02:18:38,394 --> 02:18:39,035
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I wanted.

1674
02:18:39,295 --> 02:18:45,337
[SPEAKER_25]: So you're going to have to get the prints to roll up a big Katamari first, and we're just going to roll over the Mad Catz building.

1675
02:18:46,598 --> 02:18:47,318
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1676
02:18:48,058 --> 02:18:49,259
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, hopefully it's Mad Catz.

1677
02:18:49,319 --> 02:18:50,500
[SPEAKER_08]: It shouldn't be that big.

1678
02:18:50,520 --> 02:18:53,242
[SPEAKER_08]: I can get a little binky-sized one.

1679
02:18:53,642 --> 02:18:54,502
[SPEAKER_25]: I have no idea why.

1680
02:18:54,543 --> 02:18:57,745
[SPEAKER_25]: He didn't send me a reason why, but he wants to put a Mustang on there.

1681
02:19:20,174 --> 02:19:36,781
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright A little bit of dinner there, sorry Jamie, your number three pick The Gorilla's Jeep, spelled G-E-E-P The Gorilla's Jeep, why the Jeep?

1682
02:19:37,102 --> 02:19:46,086
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, at least what's left of it since it's apparently smashed all of the basement under the car park You do understand it's a cartoon, right?

1683
02:19:48,127 --> 02:19:48,627
[SPEAKER_11]: You shut up!

1684
02:19:51,315 --> 02:19:51,755
[SPEAKER_25]: All right.

1685
02:19:52,796 --> 02:19:53,136
[SPEAKER_25]: Let's see.

1686
02:19:53,196 --> 02:19:54,597
[SPEAKER_25]: Did Ranma tell me why the Mustang?

1687
02:19:55,198 --> 02:19:55,618
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, okay.

1688
02:19:55,678 --> 02:19:57,979
[SPEAKER_25]: He says, Mustang cars rock.

1689
02:19:58,240 --> 02:19:58,660
[SPEAKER_25]: I love them.

1690
02:19:59,260 --> 02:20:00,001
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, they do.

1691
02:20:00,341 --> 02:20:00,621
[SPEAKER_25]: All right.

1692
02:20:01,882 --> 02:20:02,422
[SPEAKER_25]: Let's see.

1693
02:20:03,123 --> 02:20:05,865
[SPEAKER_25]: My number two pick for something I want to put on the Katamari.

1694
02:20:06,285 --> 02:20:15,491
[SPEAKER_25]: My number two pick is, originally I said, let's take all of Lanky Styles' Paula's Terry CDs and put them on the Katamari so we can be rid of them forever.

1695
02:20:16,708 --> 02:20:19,551
[SPEAKER_25]: But actually somebody in the chat room came up with something better, so I went with this.

1696
02:20:20,011 --> 02:20:25,416
[SPEAKER_25]: Put all of the shitty Max 300 remixes on one CD and put it on the Katamari.

1697
02:20:26,116 --> 02:20:29,319
[SPEAKER_25]: So all the shitty Max remixes, let's just roll them away.

1698
02:20:29,479 --> 02:20:34,343
[SPEAKER_25]: So shitty Max 300 remix CD is my number two pick.

1699
02:20:36,485 --> 02:20:38,046
[SPEAKER_25]: Mik Latav, what's your number two pick?

1700
02:20:40,488 --> 02:20:43,651
[SPEAKER_08]: I would want to put the tiniest picture...

1701
02:20:44,432 --> 02:20:49,414
[SPEAKER_08]: of a bear I could on the Katamari, and you would understand it if you've played the game.

1702
02:20:51,355 --> 02:20:55,616
[SPEAKER_25]: So if you've actually played the game, you'll understand why he wants to put the tiniest picture of a bear.

1703
02:20:55,736 --> 02:20:58,197
[SPEAKER_28]: That really pissed me off when making the Ursa Major.

1704
02:21:00,478 --> 02:21:00,798
[SPEAKER_25]: All right.

1705
02:21:02,719 --> 02:21:09,521
[SPEAKER_25]: Number two from Ranma, I'm reading it from the chatroom, he wants to put, he's going to put a Big Mac with cheese on the Katamari.

1706
02:21:10,154 --> 02:21:13,037
[SPEAKER_25]: Although you have to remember, no food is supposed to be on the... No, did they say no food?

1707
02:21:13,377 --> 02:21:13,937
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess they did.

1708
02:21:14,318 --> 02:21:14,878
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't think they did.

1709
02:21:14,898 --> 02:21:18,261
[SPEAKER_25]: I think they only said clothes and X-rated things, but... No, I think foods included.

1710
02:21:18,361 --> 02:21:20,563
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, well, I said calamari, so we'll let them say Big Mac.

1711
02:21:20,983 --> 02:21:24,346
[SPEAKER_25]: Big Mac, because it would be fun to roll it and see if it is edible.

1712
02:21:25,147 --> 02:21:25,247
[SPEAKER_25]: Ew.

1713
02:21:27,569 --> 02:21:27,689
[SPEAKER_25]: Ew.

1714
02:21:29,130 --> 02:21:30,431
[SPEAKER_25]: All right, Jamie, what's your number two?

1715
02:21:30,592 --> 02:21:31,472
[SPEAKER_25]: The retard ferret.

1716
02:21:34,235 --> 02:21:34,335
[SPEAKER_10]: Me.

1717
02:21:37,304 --> 02:21:39,786
[SPEAKER_25]: And the retard ferret is the one that keeps making the same noise over and over.

1718
02:21:39,906 --> 02:21:41,707
[SPEAKER_25]: We actually are going to put that on the Katamari, by the way.

1719
02:21:41,868 --> 02:21:42,048
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes.

1720
02:21:42,248 --> 02:21:42,468
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay.

1721
02:21:43,909 --> 02:21:45,190
[SPEAKER_25]: My number one choice.

1722
02:21:46,471 --> 02:21:46,791
[SPEAKER_25]: Here it is.

1723
02:21:46,851 --> 02:21:49,253
[SPEAKER_25]: My number one choice for things I want to put on the Katamari.

1724
02:21:49,674 --> 02:21:55,198
[SPEAKER_25]: I want to put a copy of Katamari Damacy on the Katamari, just to be ironic.

1725
02:21:55,478 --> 02:21:56,259
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be funny.

1726
02:21:56,899 --> 02:21:57,980
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we could do that.

1727
02:21:58,600 --> 02:22:02,303
[SPEAKER_02]: Not like actually put the game on there, but like do like a blank CD-R with the label on it.

1728
02:22:02,703 --> 02:22:03,244
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be funny.

1729
02:22:03,507 --> 02:22:05,488
[SPEAKER_25]: I want to put a bumble ball on it, because it looks like a Katamari.

1730
02:22:05,508 --> 02:22:05,788
[SPEAKER_25]: A bumble ball?

1731
02:22:05,808 --> 02:22:07,108
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, he's right, they do look like a Katamari.

1732
02:22:07,128 --> 02:22:09,389
[SPEAKER_25]: They totally look like Katamaris.

1733
02:22:09,769 --> 02:22:10,889
[SPEAKER_25]: See, he's being ironic, too.

1734
02:22:10,989 --> 02:22:11,869
[SPEAKER_25]: Good pick, Miklatov.

1735
02:22:29,387 --> 02:22:31,449
[SPEAKER_25]: Um, Ranma, number one.

1736
02:22:32,109 --> 02:22:35,051
[SPEAKER_25]: He wants to put a Nintendo DS on the Katamari.

1737
02:22:35,652 --> 02:22:36,272
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay.

1738
02:22:36,452 --> 02:22:39,034
[SPEAKER_25]: Because the DS is too awesome not to put on there.

1739
02:22:39,554 --> 02:22:42,537
[SPEAKER_25]: I say that that's about the only good thing your DS can do right now.

1740
02:22:42,837 --> 02:22:43,557
[SPEAKER_10]: Ah!

1741
02:22:44,118 --> 02:22:45,359
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm taking my DS with me.

1742
02:22:45,679 --> 02:22:47,560
[SPEAKER_25]: No, I know, E3 will change our minds.

1743
02:22:47,620 --> 02:22:49,902
[SPEAKER_25]: The Nintendo DS will be beautiful after E3.

1744
02:22:50,022 --> 02:22:54,365
[SPEAKER_25]: Um, but right now I'm kind of pissed because, like, you call Polarium a game?

1745
02:22:56,767 --> 02:22:57,167
[SPEAKER_25]: All right.

1746
02:22:57,611 --> 02:23:00,252
[SPEAKER_25]: What's your number one, DarkSakura?

1747
02:23:00,532 --> 02:23:03,113
[SPEAKER_02]: A gigantic, huge mungus.

1748
02:23:03,973 --> 02:23:05,193
[SPEAKER_02]: Reject false icon sticker.

1749
02:23:05,413 --> 02:23:08,374
[SPEAKER_25]: Reject false icon sticker, and why is that?

1750
02:23:09,095 --> 02:23:21,118
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the giant Katamari will probably be made up of a bunch of false icons, and what better to put on it than a big sticker that tells them that they should all go do something useful, like be a real star.

1751
02:23:21,138 --> 02:23:22,159
[SPEAKER_25]: There you go.

1752
02:23:22,279 --> 02:23:22,679
[SPEAKER_25]: All right.

1753
02:23:23,411 --> 02:23:26,813
[SPEAKER_25]: Listen carefully, Miklatov and Ranma in the chatroom.

1754
02:23:26,853 --> 02:23:33,257
[SPEAKER_25]: Listen carefully because you have to figure out which one of these you want to vote off of the list.

1755
02:23:33,737 --> 02:23:35,478
[SPEAKER_25]: One of these you have to vote off the list.

1756
02:23:37,880 --> 02:23:38,520
[SPEAKER_25]: I will start.

1757
02:23:38,560 --> 02:23:39,081
[SPEAKER_25]: Did I start?

1758
02:23:39,481 --> 02:23:39,921
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, I did.

1759
02:23:40,241 --> 02:23:40,562
[SPEAKER_25]: Here it is.

1760
02:23:40,662 --> 02:23:51,028
[SPEAKER_25]: Calamari, Mad Catz, Mustang, Gorilla's Jeep, Shitty Max 300 Remix CD, Tiniest Picture of a Bear,

1761
02:23:51,801 --> 02:24:01,766
[SPEAKER_25]: Big Mac with Cheese, Retard Ferret, a copy of Katamari Damacy, Bumble Ball, Nintendo DS, and a Reject False Icon sticker.

1762
02:24:02,927 --> 02:24:04,788
[SPEAKER_25]: I am going to take off this list... Huh?

1763
02:24:04,928 --> 02:24:05,268
[SPEAKER_25]: A huge one.

1764
02:24:05,288 --> 02:24:05,528
[SPEAKER_25]: A huge one.

1765
02:24:05,729 --> 02:24:06,049
[SPEAKER_25]: A big one.

1766
02:24:06,929 --> 02:24:10,231
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm going to take off a Big Mac with Cheese, because that's just kind of weird.

1767
02:24:10,311 --> 02:24:12,612
[SPEAKER_25]: Sorry, Ranma, but I don't even like McDonald's to begin with.

1768
02:24:12,932 --> 02:24:14,874
[SPEAKER_25]: Except I do like that walnut salad they have now.

1769
02:24:14,914 --> 02:24:15,714
[SPEAKER_25]: It's actually kind of yummy.

1770
02:24:15,974 --> 02:24:16,915
[SPEAKER_02]: The Cobb salad's pretty good.

1771
02:24:17,135 --> 02:24:17,275
[SPEAKER_25]: Mm-hmm.

1772
02:24:17,775 --> 02:24:18,075
[SPEAKER_25]: All right.

1773
02:24:18,255 --> 02:24:19,116
[SPEAKER_25]: Meek Latav, you there?

1774
02:24:19,136 --> 02:24:21,097
[SPEAKER_25]: I thought...

1775
02:24:21,499 --> 02:24:21,999
[SPEAKER_25]: Miklatov?

1776
02:24:23,040 --> 02:24:23,280
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1777
02:24:23,521 --> 02:24:24,842
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, what are you taking off the list?

1778
02:24:26,123 --> 02:24:26,943
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, a Mustang.

1779
02:24:27,344 --> 02:24:28,264
[SPEAKER_25]: The Mustang!

1780
02:24:28,324 --> 02:24:29,185
[SPEAKER_25]: Why the Mustang?

1781
02:24:30,566 --> 02:24:32,087
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't make any sense to me.

1782
02:24:32,668 --> 02:24:34,089
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, poor Ranma.

1783
02:24:34,189 --> 02:24:36,131
[SPEAKER_25]: Like, his whole list just almost got axed.

1784
02:24:36,291 --> 02:24:36,611
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright.

1785
02:24:37,472 --> 02:24:43,256
[SPEAKER_25]: Um, Ranma hasn't sent me which one he's going to vote off yet, so I guess, Jamie, you're going to be next.

1786
02:24:43,316 --> 02:24:43,977
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me see the list.

1787
02:24:47,339 --> 02:24:47,740
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

1788
02:24:47,760 --> 02:24:47,800
[SPEAKER_25]: Um...

1789
02:24:50,342 --> 02:24:51,363
[SPEAKER_25]: DarkSakura, here it is.

1790
02:24:51,724 --> 02:24:52,945
[SPEAKER_25]: Do you need that a little bigger there?

1791
02:24:53,185 --> 02:24:53,926
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't highlight it, please.

1792
02:24:54,106 --> 02:24:54,447
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, sorry.

1793
02:24:55,187 --> 02:24:55,888
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't need it bigger.

1794
02:24:55,968 --> 02:24:56,569
[SPEAKER_02]: Just don't highlight it.

1795
02:24:56,769 --> 02:24:57,049
[SPEAKER_02]: My bad.

1796
02:24:58,071 --> 02:25:04,337
[SPEAKER_28]: Uh... Uh... God.

1797
02:25:04,358 --> 02:25:06,600
[SPEAKER_28]: You know what?

1798
02:25:06,720 --> 02:25:09,163
[SPEAKER_28]: Take off Mad Catz, because then... Aww.

1799
02:25:10,203 --> 02:25:10,723
[SPEAKER_02]: The Nintendo DS.

1800
02:25:38,451 --> 02:25:39,172

1801
02:25:54,694 --> 02:26:08,063
[SPEAKER_25]: a shitty Max 300 remix CD, the tiniest picture of a bear, the retard ferret, a copy of Katamari Damacy, Bumble Ball, Nintendo DS, and a large reject false icon stickers.

1802
02:26:08,403 --> 02:26:09,964
[SPEAKER_25]: Place your vote now.

1803
02:26:10,264 --> 02:26:15,027
[SPEAKER_25]: Send a private message to Sky with what you want to be at the top of this definitive list.

1804
02:26:15,587 --> 02:26:16,688
[SPEAKER_25]: Thanks for playing, Mikotov.

1805
02:26:16,728 --> 02:26:17,308
[SPEAKER_25]: Appreciate it.

1806
02:26:18,269 --> 02:26:18,789
[SPEAKER_08]: No problem.

1807
02:26:18,909 --> 02:26:21,511
[SPEAKER_25]: Hey, what are your plans for E3 next week?

1808
02:26:21,531 --> 02:26:22,672
[SPEAKER_25]: What do you hope to see at the show?

1809
02:26:24,485 --> 02:26:28,328
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm actually really looking forward to going to play Phantasy Star Universe.

1810
02:26:28,348 --> 02:26:30,109
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't know it was going to be there.

1811
02:26:30,449 --> 02:26:31,570
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, his voice is kind of quiet.

1812
02:26:31,590 --> 02:26:31,890
[SPEAKER_25]: Sorry, guys.

1813
02:26:31,930 --> 02:26:34,072
[SPEAKER_25]: It's Phantasy Star Universe is what he said.

1814
02:26:34,272 --> 02:26:35,633
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking forward to that as well.

1815
02:26:35,653 --> 02:26:37,494
[SPEAKER_02]: We played PSO Blueburst with us last night.

1816
02:26:38,174 --> 02:26:38,815
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, it was fun.

1817
02:26:38,855 --> 02:26:39,335
[SPEAKER_02]: Good times.

1818
02:26:39,535 --> 02:26:40,436
[SPEAKER_02]: It was awesome.

1819
02:26:40,736 --> 02:26:41,136
[SPEAKER_25]: It was good.

1820
02:26:41,276 --> 02:26:44,218
[SPEAKER_25]: Now that I'm in the caves, I can level more faster.

1821
02:26:44,238 --> 02:26:47,140
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for letting me leech all the loot because I was poor.

1822
02:26:47,180 --> 02:26:48,921
[SPEAKER_02]: It's okay.

1823
02:26:49,061 --> 02:26:50,382
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm poor now because I have 75 Meseta.

1824
02:26:53,874 --> 02:26:57,978
[SPEAKER_25]: If I didn't have to pack tonight, I would totally play more.

1825
02:26:58,338 --> 02:26:59,819
[SPEAKER_02]: I get to pack tomorrow.

1826
02:27:00,160 --> 02:27:01,521
[SPEAKER_02]: My ass is playing.

1827
02:27:01,721 --> 02:27:03,903
[SPEAKER_25]: 24 hours from now, I will be at the More Friends concert.

1828
02:27:04,283 --> 02:27:04,704
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

1829
02:27:04,744 --> 02:27:06,525
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't give a rat's ass.

1830
02:27:06,565 --> 02:27:07,006
[SPEAKER_24]: Go to hell.

1831
02:27:07,186 --> 02:27:07,586
[SPEAKER_25]: Go to hell.

1832
02:27:08,427 --> 02:27:08,847
[SPEAKER_25]: All right.

1833
02:27:09,868 --> 02:27:11,249
[SPEAKER_25]: Anything else you want to share with our listeners?

1834
02:27:11,509 --> 02:27:13,431
[SPEAKER_08]: Not really.

1835
02:27:13,451 --> 02:27:13,651
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1836
02:27:13,671 --> 02:27:14,172
[SPEAKER_08]: Then I'm hanging up.

1837
02:27:14,212 --> 02:27:16,694
[SPEAKER_08]: Go back to play some Guild Wars probably.

1838
02:27:16,814 --> 02:27:17,154
[SPEAKER_25]: All right.

1839
02:27:17,194 --> 02:27:17,535
[SPEAKER_25]: Have fun.

1840
02:27:17,555 --> 02:27:18,295
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm hanging up on you.

1841
02:27:19,336 --> 02:27:19,436
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1842
02:27:19,456 --> 02:27:19,817
[SPEAKER_25]: All right.

1843
02:27:19,837 --> 02:27:19,997
[SPEAKER_25]: Bye.

1844
02:27:22,086 --> 02:27:23,347
[SPEAKER_25]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1845
02:27:48,212 --> 02:27:51,833
[SPEAKER_25]: By the way, which also got brought up in there, before we go to break, we should mention this real briefly.

1846
02:27:52,134 --> 02:27:53,514
[SPEAKER_25]: It's been mentioned twice in the show now.

1847
02:27:53,594 --> 02:27:59,256
[SPEAKER_25]: MadCatz will be publishing Pump It Up, to which some of us go, Oh, God.

1848
02:27:59,276 --> 02:28:04,218
[SPEAKER_28]: It gets the DMV size.

1849
02:28:06,499 --> 02:28:07,559
[SPEAKER_25]: Exactly, exactly.

1850
02:28:08,800 --> 02:28:11,581
[SPEAKER_25]: I just hope they don't fuck it up somehow.

1851
02:28:11,681 --> 02:28:12,841
[SPEAKER_25]: I just blew our listeners.

1852
02:28:14,082 --> 02:28:14,742
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm such a hoe.

1853
02:28:14,942 --> 02:28:15,222
[SPEAKER_25]: Hot.

1854
02:28:16,334 --> 02:28:17,555
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright, we'll be back after this.

1855
02:28:17,655 --> 02:28:19,336
[SPEAKER_25]: More Potpourri here in this break.

1856
02:28:19,376 --> 02:28:21,096
[SPEAKER_25]: Started off with one of Jamie's favorite songs.

1857
02:28:21,296 --> 02:28:22,117
[SPEAKER_25]: I know this for a fact.

1858
02:28:22,697 --> 02:28:24,718
[SPEAKER_25]: And we'll be back after this with more Orange Lines Radio.

1859
02:28:24,738 --> 02:28:26,259
[SPEAKER_25]: The definitive list and the FUs of the week.

1860
02:28:26,399 --> 02:28:27,259
[SPEAKER_25]: All when we come back.

1861
02:28:27,920 --> 02:28:28,300

02:29:49,353 --> 02:29:50,833
I just did not have love for you

1866
02:30:21,953 --> 02:30:43,352
I need to know, I need to know, I need to know how you feel I gotta know, I gotta know, I gotta know if it's real I need to know, I need to know, I need to know how you feel I gotta know, I gotta know, I gotta know if it's real I need to know how you feel I just didn't find my love for you

1867

I'm giving all my heart to you, my love I justify my love for you I'm giving you my heart, my soul, my love I justify my love for you I justify my love for you I'm giving all my heart to you, my love I justify my love for you I'm giving you my heart, my soul

1868
02:31:16,698 --> 02:31:17,979
Music Music Music Music

1869
02:32:31,279 --> 02:32:32,621
Thanks for watching!

1870
02:33:02,036 --> 02:33:02,438
[SPEAKER_13]: and many more.

1871

Thanks for watching!

1872
02:34:02,667 --> 02:34:03,429
Thanks for watching!

1873
02:35:01,864 --> 02:35:05,185
The Orange Lounge Radio with the ping pong ball.

1874
02:35:05,205 --> 02:35:05,385
Woo!

1875
02:35:31,581 --> 02:35:33,983
[SPEAKER_25]: Hi, we're back on Orange Lounge Radio.

1876
02:35:35,264 --> 02:35:38,848
[SPEAKER_25]: I was just barking E3 quarters to DarkSakura there during break.

1877
02:35:40,349 --> 02:35:40,870
[SPEAKER_25]: Sorry.

1878
02:35:41,510 --> 02:35:42,171
[SPEAKER_25]: You know I love ya.

1879
02:35:43,132 --> 02:35:44,133
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm just giving a heads up.

1880
02:35:44,273 --> 02:35:45,994
[SPEAKER_25]: I do not want chaos like last year.

1881
02:35:46,335 --> 02:35:48,397
[SPEAKER_25]: I was pissed off after that night last year.

1882
02:35:51,989 --> 02:35:57,411
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't get... I don't... Despite my on-air persona, I don't get bitchy in real life that often.

1883
02:35:57,451 --> 02:35:59,152
[SPEAKER_25]: But that got me really bitchy.

1884
02:35:59,532 --> 02:36:01,253
[SPEAKER_02]: So just... You're funny when you're bitchy.

1885
02:36:02,333 --> 02:36:05,234
[SPEAKER_02]: You are damn hilarious when you are bitchy.

1886
02:36:05,254 --> 02:36:06,695
[SPEAKER_25]: Because I get totally faggy.

1887
02:36:06,735 --> 02:36:07,915
[SPEAKER_25]: And I can say that because I am a fag.

1888
02:36:08,235 --> 02:36:10,536
[SPEAKER_25]: I get totally faggy, you know, when I'm bitchy.

1889
02:36:10,596 --> 02:36:12,277
[SPEAKER_25]: And just like, uh-uh, uh-uh.

1890
02:36:13,337 --> 02:36:13,597
[SPEAKER_25]: Anyway.

1891
02:36:14,598 --> 02:36:15,238
[SPEAKER_25]: Girl.

1892
02:36:15,938 --> 02:36:17,138
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm just not going through that again.

1893
02:36:18,699 --> 02:36:20,700
[SPEAKER_02]: I have that stuck in my head because I listen to...

1894
02:36:21,545 --> 02:36:23,206
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1895
02:36:42,904 --> 02:36:47,325
[SPEAKER_25]: Let's reveal the definitive list as voted on by you guys.

1896
02:36:47,385 --> 02:36:48,886
[SPEAKER_25]: Here it is, the definitive list.

1897
02:36:49,306 --> 02:36:53,267
[SPEAKER_25]: Top things you want to see stuck on the giant Katamari ball at E3.

1898
02:36:53,367 --> 02:36:57,088
[SPEAKER_25]: Number three, reject false icon sticker.

1899
02:36:57,108 --> 02:37:00,749
[SPEAKER_25]: A very large reject false icon sticker.

1900
02:37:01,709 --> 02:37:05,670
[SPEAKER_25]: Number two, a shitty Max 300 remix CD.

1901
02:37:07,270 --> 02:37:10,531
[SPEAKER_25]: And the number one thing you would like to have...

1902
02:37:11,345 --> 02:37:16,366
[SPEAKER_25]: Stuck on the Katamari Dimashiball at E3 is a copy of Katamari Dimashiball.

1903
02:37:16,786 --> 02:37:18,307
[SPEAKER_28]: You guys are so ironic.

1904
02:37:18,367 --> 02:37:18,967
[SPEAKER_28]: I love you all.

1905
02:37:19,627 --> 02:37:24,688
[SPEAKER_25]: It's like Ray Yane on your wedding day.

1906
02:37:25,288 --> 02:37:26,288
[SPEAKER_28]: A little too ironic.

1907
02:37:26,828 --> 02:37:27,348
[SPEAKER_25]: Don't you think?

1908
02:37:28,829 --> 02:37:30,349
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, a little too wrath.

1909
02:37:30,949 --> 02:37:31,249
[SPEAKER_28]: Sorry.

1910
02:37:33,910 --> 02:37:34,410
[SPEAKER_28]: But not really.

1911
02:37:35,130 --> 02:37:37,351
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm sorry, but if you can have your gorillas thing...

1912
02:37:39,775 --> 02:37:45,218
[SPEAKER_25]: Then I'm entitled to this little clip that makes me think of what just happened there in Listless.

1913
02:37:45,998 --> 02:37:54,082
[SPEAKER_02]: You are such an Alanis whore.

1914
02:37:54,803 --> 02:37:56,744
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you guys should hear Rob at karaoke.

1915
02:37:57,444 --> 02:38:05,128
[SPEAKER_02]: He gets on stage and the question that passes through the entire karaoke room, Which Alanis song is it this week, Rob?

1916
02:38:06,168 --> 02:38:06,489
Cho-Chi.

1917
02:38:08,169 --> 02:38:09,830
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, yeah, yeah.

1918
02:38:38,951 --> 02:38:42,213
[SPEAKER_25]: But see, and isn't it unfortunate, it doesn't have the same ring to it.

1919
02:38:42,973 --> 02:38:49,137
[SPEAKER_25]: And then, that's funny, because the way that goes is that MPQ goes, that song isn't ironic, it's just unfortunate, and dudes go, it's not a tumor.

1920
02:38:52,179 --> 02:38:52,739
[SPEAKER_25]: Girl.

1921
02:38:54,280 --> 02:38:55,541
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't do it the way she does.

1922
02:38:55,761 --> 02:38:57,022
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, girl.

1923
02:38:57,582 --> 02:38:58,182
[SPEAKER_25]: Girl.

1924
02:38:58,923 --> 02:39:00,243
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, girl.

1925
02:39:02,765 --> 02:39:07,648
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, now that we've lost half our audience there, hey, at least we're not talking about the damn lawsuit anymore.

1926
02:39:07,728 --> 02:39:07,988
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay.

1927
02:39:09,607 --> 02:39:10,708
[SPEAKER_25]: Here we go, FUs of the Week.

1928
02:39:10,728 --> 02:39:12,008
[SPEAKER_25]: And you have a new FU song.

1929
02:39:12,568 --> 02:39:14,969
[SPEAKER_25]: You couldn't just stick with one, could you, DarkSakura?

1930
02:39:14,989 --> 02:39:15,529
[SPEAKER_25]: You have a new one.

1931
02:39:15,869 --> 02:39:18,029
[SPEAKER_02]: Because people butched about my last one.

1932
02:39:18,129 --> 02:39:21,170
[SPEAKER_02]: I used it for other things on the show, so I found something more appropriate.

1933
02:39:21,190 --> 02:39:21,870
[SPEAKER_25]: All right, here we go.

1934
02:39:22,270 --> 02:39:24,791
[SPEAKER_25]: And Jamie, why do we do the FUs every single week?

1935
02:39:25,591 --> 02:39:26,311
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we can.

1936
02:39:35,797 --> 02:39:42,485
[SPEAKER_02]: What better to illustrate my wrath than to use Dan's ear, a.k.a.

1937
02:39:42,565 --> 02:39:43,886
[SPEAKER_02]: the wrath of God.

1938
02:39:46,229 --> 02:39:48,031
[SPEAKER_02]: Girl, I can't do it.

1939
02:39:48,432 --> 02:39:51,976
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, big F you to the bitches who broke into Rob's car.

1940
02:39:52,877 --> 02:39:53,237
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

1941
02:39:53,457 --> 02:39:53,978
[SPEAKER_28]: You're welcome.

1942
02:39:57,498 --> 02:40:04,283
[SPEAKER_02]: FU to missing out on homemade banana, not banana, coconut cream pie with extra coconut in it.

1943
02:40:04,683 --> 02:40:07,725
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a bite of it that was hot.

1944
02:40:09,747 --> 02:40:20,074
[SPEAKER_02]: And then FU to being so weak in Blue Burst that like one damn hit from the dragon put me down to four hit points.

1945
02:40:21,035 --> 02:40:22,135
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to level some more.

1946
02:40:22,516 --> 02:40:24,997
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and damn expensive to play FOMORO.

1947
02:40:25,097 --> 02:40:25,838
[SPEAKER_02]: God, you have to...

1948
02:40:26,437 --> 02:40:34,302
[SPEAKER_02]: Buy this and buy that and buy your... And I miss my hacked item from the Xbox one.

1949
02:40:34,362 --> 02:40:35,843
[SPEAKER_02]: I carry around a giant pink purse.

1950
02:40:37,104 --> 02:40:37,984
[SPEAKER_02]: So I miss that too.

1951
02:40:38,885 --> 02:40:39,985
[SPEAKER_25]: I want to carry a pink purse.

1952
02:40:41,106 --> 02:40:41,927
[SPEAKER_02]: Eventually, maybe.

1953
02:40:45,729 --> 02:40:46,770
[SPEAKER_02]: I miss how rap is too.

1954
02:40:47,950 --> 02:40:49,811
[SPEAKER_02]: And F you to Loki's song.

1955
02:40:50,672 --> 02:40:54,514
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it is annoying and I picked it just to annoy our listeners.

1956
02:40:54,654 --> 02:40:55,395
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I love you all.

1957
02:40:56,232 --> 02:40:56,512
[SPEAKER_02]: A little.

1958
02:40:58,052 --> 02:40:59,413
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not really too angsty, you know.

1959
02:40:59,433 --> 02:41:00,993
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been in a fantastic... Oh, yeah.

1960
02:41:01,413 --> 02:41:04,534
[SPEAKER_25]: An FU... This song gets really quiet, by the way, towards the end.

1961
02:41:05,134 --> 02:41:06,654
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll have to pick something else.

1962
02:41:06,674 --> 02:41:07,314
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm going to loop it.

1963
02:41:07,594 --> 02:41:09,915
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck you to having to pick another song, damn it.

1964
02:41:11,615 --> 02:41:20,317
[SPEAKER_02]: Um... Oh, yeah, and an FU to FreeMP3Player.com or whatever it is.

1965
02:41:20,597 --> 02:41:23,578
[SPEAKER_02]: Because now I have to wait for them to verify it again.

1966
02:41:23,598 --> 02:41:23,638
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1967
02:41:26,258 --> 02:41:28,760
[SPEAKER_02]: My man wouldn't let me buy a mini-disc player.

1968
02:41:29,720 --> 02:41:34,143
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think that there should be a PayPal account or something set up.

1969
02:41:34,503 --> 02:41:37,745
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called the Buy DarkSakura, a mini-disc player fund.

1970
02:41:39,747 --> 02:41:40,587
[SPEAKER_02]: Wouldn't that be awesome?

1971
02:41:41,928 --> 02:41:42,428
[SPEAKER_25]: For you.

1972
02:41:42,829 --> 02:41:43,949
[SPEAKER_02]: I need a mini-disc player.

1973
02:41:44,990 --> 02:41:46,211
[SPEAKER_02]: Chatroom, you love me, right?

1974
02:41:47,231 --> 02:41:48,432
[SPEAKER_02]: Buy me one, please.

1975
02:41:49,133 --> 02:41:49,613
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I'm done.

1976
02:41:50,734 --> 02:41:51,854
[SPEAKER_25]: Let's get to Loki's FU.

1977
02:41:51,894 --> 02:41:52,775
[SPEAKER_25]: He actually sent me one.

1978
02:41:57,406 --> 02:41:59,767
[SPEAKER_25]: I wish I could read these like Loki does his FUs.

1979
02:42:03,789 --> 02:42:04,349
[SPEAKER_25]: Just kidding.

1980
02:42:05,950 --> 02:42:09,812
[SPEAKER_25]: Loki's FU this week is towards German spammers.

1981
02:42:10,452 --> 02:42:14,554
[SPEAKER_25]: I've been getting tons of German spam all day on my Yahoo account.

1982
02:42:16,575 --> 02:42:17,416
[SPEAKER_25]: That's his only FU.

1983
02:42:18,996 --> 02:42:21,057
[SPEAKER_25]: It's not as funny when I read them, I'm sorry guys.

1984
02:42:21,398 --> 02:42:22,178
[SPEAKER_25]: But now it's my turn.

1985
02:42:26,129 --> 02:42:30,591
[SPEAKER_25]: My FU goes to the little motherfucker with no balls that broke into my car this week.

1986
02:42:30,651 --> 02:42:31,151
[SPEAKER_25]: Fuck you.

1987
02:42:31,571 --> 02:42:34,652
[SPEAKER_25]: I got the last laugh in the end because that fucking stereo you stole was broken.

1988
02:42:35,012 --> 02:42:36,433
[SPEAKER_25]: Fuck you for stealing my class ring.

1989
02:42:36,453 --> 02:42:38,214
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't give a fuck if I hated high school.

1990
02:42:38,254 --> 02:42:39,494
[SPEAKER_25]: You had no right to take that shit.

1991
02:42:39,854 --> 02:42:42,876
[SPEAKER_25]: Why do people on this planet think that they can take shit that's not theirs?

1992
02:42:42,976 --> 02:42:43,456
[SPEAKER_25]: I hate you.

1993
02:42:43,556 --> 02:42:43,896
[SPEAKER_25]: Die.

1994
02:42:46,275 --> 02:42:50,516
[SPEAKER_25]: F you to the fact that I wasn't able to take a trip to the Bay Area this weekend because I was kind of looking forward to it.

1995
02:42:50,576 --> 02:42:52,516
[SPEAKER_25]: But there's just more important shit that's got to be done.

1996
02:42:52,716 --> 02:42:54,657
[SPEAKER_25]: F you to all the stress that comes before E3.

1997
02:42:55,037 --> 02:42:59,498
[SPEAKER_25]: F you to all the work that I'm going to have to be doing at E3 next week because I'm just supposed to go there and play games all day.

1998
02:42:59,518 --> 02:43:02,138
[SPEAKER_25]: But no, I'm going to slave my butt off for you guys.

1999
02:43:02,218 --> 02:43:07,200
[SPEAKER_25]: So, you know, I hope that you guys just kiss my ass after this because, you know, we're going to work it for you.

2000
02:43:08,000 --> 02:43:08,520
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm just kidding.

2001
02:43:08,540 --> 02:43:09,380
[SPEAKER_25]: I do it because I love you guys.

2002
02:43:09,847 --> 02:43:11,228
[SPEAKER_25]: But damn, E3's a lot of work.

2003
02:43:11,428 --> 02:43:17,293
[SPEAKER_25]: An FU to stress, an FU to the fact that I'm short on money right now because of a glitch and stuff I don't want to talk about.

2004
02:43:17,734 --> 02:43:18,394
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, that's it.

2005
02:43:20,656 --> 02:43:21,517
[SPEAKER_25]: That's my FUs of the week.

2006
02:43:21,977 --> 02:43:23,159
[SPEAKER_25]: Let's get to the chatroom FUs of the week.

2007
02:43:28,323 --> 02:43:30,145
[SPEAKER_25]: This is the Captain Jack cover of Holiday, by the way.

2008
02:43:31,265 --> 02:43:37,591
[SPEAKER_25]: Mikhail Tov would like to give his first FU to his computer for randomly freezing when he's in the middle of Guild Wars or Phantasy Star Blue Burst.

2009
02:43:38,055 --> 02:43:40,878
[SPEAKER_25]: Second FU is for that horrible American dad show.

2010
02:43:41,398 --> 02:43:47,584
[SPEAKER_25]: The only redeeming factor on it, which isn't even enough to make me watch it, is Greg and Terry because they are adorable.

2011
02:43:47,964 --> 02:43:50,847
[SPEAKER_25]: And finally, FU to my car making funny funky noises.

2012
02:43:53,032 --> 02:44:00,298
[SPEAKER_25]: MPQ says, I somehow expect half the people to F you the Konami vs. Rockstar thing, so I'm going with something different.

2013
02:44:00,658 --> 02:44:03,640
[SPEAKER_25]: Fuck Colors and 2DX, I will never beat that fucking song.

2014
02:44:04,041 --> 02:44:08,344
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh yeah, and F you to kicking and screaming, total waste of money, I walked out, it was so bad.

2015
02:44:10,085 --> 02:44:15,650
[SPEAKER_25]: Doob says, F you to Brazilian people who play MMORPGs because they can't speak proper English.

2016
02:44:16,390 --> 02:44:22,315
[SPEAKER_25]: F you to being a high school freshman because when I think, yay, school is almost over, I think, oh crap, three more years left.

2017
02:44:22,830 --> 02:44:24,511
[SPEAKER_03]: You just need to learn to speak Portuguese.

2018
02:44:24,931 --> 02:44:27,152
[SPEAKER_25]: I think we should just stick doobs in a trash can.

2019
02:44:27,813 --> 02:44:29,413
[SPEAKER_02]: No, because he's a Gorillaz fan now.

2020
02:44:29,433 --> 02:44:31,775
[SPEAKER_25]: You know how we used to do to freshmen in high schools?

2021
02:44:31,795 --> 02:44:33,355
[SPEAKER_25]: You'd stick them in a trash can, you'd can them.

2022
02:44:34,036 --> 02:44:36,457
[SPEAKER_03]: We'd tell them that there was a pool under the gym.

2023
02:44:37,778 --> 02:44:40,519
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they'd pass us to use it, and then an elevator passed.

2024
02:44:41,419 --> 02:44:43,540
[SPEAKER_25]: Even though your school was on one floor?

2025
02:44:43,921 --> 02:44:44,581
[SPEAKER_03]: We were two floors.

2026
02:44:45,493 --> 02:44:48,817
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, our school's only one floor, and people would sell elevator passes.

2027
02:44:49,358 --> 02:44:54,583
[SPEAKER_25]: Ranma says, F you to my coworkers for screwing me out of my time off for an amazement on Memorial Day weekend.

2028
02:44:54,964 --> 02:44:57,026
[SPEAKER_25]: Don't say shit when I put the screws to you.

2029
02:44:58,267 --> 02:44:58,828
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, girl.

2030
02:45:00,610 --> 02:45:05,756
[SPEAKER_25]: Dark Knight says, a big F you to singlehood, and, um, that's it.

2031
02:45:08,971 --> 02:45:18,256
[SPEAKER_25]: LemonLimeJump says, F you to the Domino's cheeseburger pizza for being really disgusting.

2032
02:45:18,436 --> 02:45:20,757
[SPEAKER_25]: I could have told you that without eating the damn thing.

2033
02:45:22,278 --> 02:45:24,539
[SPEAKER_25]: I think even those cheeseburger hot pockets are disgusting.

2034
02:45:24,559 --> 02:45:25,339
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know if you've ever had one.

2035
02:45:25,359 --> 02:45:25,820
[SPEAKER_25]: They're gross.

2036
02:45:26,860 --> 02:45:30,062
[SPEAKER_25]: I enjoy a good cheeseburger and I love pizza, but that thing's gross.

2037
02:45:30,202 --> 02:45:30,582
[SPEAKER_25]: Avoid.

2038
02:45:33,841 --> 02:45:38,085
[SPEAKER_25]: Uh, Ninst says, oh, no, never mind, he's, uh, sending me messages on PSO.

2039
02:45:38,685 --> 02:45:42,609
[SPEAKER_25]: Uh, Jin4576 says, F you to Kingston, New York, Cyber Station.

2040
02:45:42,889 --> 02:45:46,172
[SPEAKER_25]: Your DDR-EX machine is in such bad condition and you don't care.

2041
02:45:46,632 --> 02:45:50,816
[SPEAKER_25]: The pad is on a tilt and you think that putting tiles on the bottom of the pad will fix it.

2042
02:45:51,116 --> 02:45:55,540
[SPEAKER_25]: Here's some advice, get a new machine or actually try to fix the machine and not half-ass it.

2043
02:45:57,998 --> 02:46:02,440
[SPEAKER_25]: And Illusion would like to say, F you to the whole tricky business with Konami and Roxor.

2044
02:46:02,800 --> 02:46:04,441
[SPEAKER_25]: Did Roxor do something illegal?

2045
02:46:04,781 --> 02:46:05,021
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes.

2046
02:46:05,081 --> 02:46:06,301
[SPEAKER_25]: Do they deserve to be sued?

2047
02:46:06,641 --> 02:46:06,902
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes.

2048
02:46:07,242 --> 02:46:10,083
[SPEAKER_25]: But couldn't they have sued them a week after the game was released or something?

2049
02:46:10,883 --> 02:46:12,944
[SPEAKER_25]: Fuck whoever predicted that F you, you jerk.

2050
02:46:13,184 --> 02:46:14,645
[SPEAKER_25]: It wasn't Miklatov, by the way, Illusion.

2051
02:46:14,665 --> 02:46:15,365
[SPEAKER_25]: It was the guy after him.

2052
02:46:16,825 --> 02:46:17,206
[SPEAKER_25]: And that's it.

2053
02:46:17,226 --> 02:46:18,066
[SPEAKER_25]: That was the last F you.

2054
02:46:19,206 --> 02:46:20,347
[SPEAKER_25]: I just want to add to that, though.

2055
02:46:20,447 --> 02:46:23,068
[SPEAKER_25]: You do know that lawsuits aren't written overnight, right?

2056
02:46:24,477 --> 02:46:29,621
[SPEAKER_25]: and the rumor going around is that this thing has actually been planned for months and it's just funny timing or something.

2057
02:46:29,721 --> 02:46:30,062
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know.

2058
02:46:31,603 --> 02:46:32,003
[SPEAKER_25]: I like that.

2059
02:46:32,043 --> 02:46:34,845
[SPEAKER_25]: LemonLimeJump in the chatroom says, Reject Grote's Pizza.

2060
02:46:36,407 --> 02:46:36,887
[SPEAKER_25]: That's good.

2061
02:46:37,007 --> 02:46:37,508
[SPEAKER_25]: That's really good.

2062
02:46:38,488 --> 02:46:38,789
[SPEAKER_25]: All right.

2063
02:46:40,191 --> 02:46:46,876
[SPEAKER_25]: One thing we want to tell you guys about, because we're getting towards the end of the show, we're going to do some Ask Orange Lounge real quick, because we know it's kind of the E3 edition.

2064
02:46:47,376 --> 02:46:50,138
[SPEAKER_25]: So send us your questions for Ask Orange Lounge right now.

2065
02:46:50,158 --> 02:46:52,039
[SPEAKER_25]: We're going to do a quick break, then we'll come back and answer those.

2066
02:46:53,040 --> 02:46:55,921
[SPEAKER_25]: What we do want to say, though, we have an email address set up.

2067
02:46:56,082 --> 02:47:00,424
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, actually, no, I've got to make one tweak to it, and then we will give you the email address.

2068
02:47:00,585 --> 02:47:01,165
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm just kidding.

2069
02:47:01,405 --> 02:47:03,506
[SPEAKER_25]: We will give you that email address when we come back from this break.

2070
02:47:03,526 --> 02:47:04,347
[SPEAKER_25]: How's that sound?

2071
02:47:06,408 --> 02:47:07,329
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, I'm with it tonight.

2072
02:47:08,109 --> 02:47:09,430
[SPEAKER_28]: You are so there.

2073
02:47:09,711 --> 02:47:11,412
[SPEAKER_28]: You know, you were just so on the ball.

2074
02:47:11,572 --> 02:47:11,873
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

2075
02:47:12,353 --> 02:47:12,633
[SPEAKER_28]: Whatever.

2076
02:47:12,653 --> 02:47:14,035
[SPEAKER_28]: You were on the ball, then you fell off.

2077
02:47:14,055 --> 02:47:15,736
[SPEAKER_25]: We're going to take a quick two-song break.

2078
02:47:15,756 --> 02:47:16,697
[SPEAKER_25]: Just a quick two-song break.

2079
02:47:16,717 --> 02:47:18,699
[SPEAKER_25]: We'll be back with Ask Orange Lounge.

2080
02:47:19,059 --> 02:47:25,605
[SPEAKER_25]: Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your Ask Orange Lounge question, and we will be back after this.

2081
02:47:25,685 --> 02:47:29,289
[SPEAKER_25]: Start it off with a little bit of a... I think this could be an anthem song for Jamie.

2082
02:47:29,609 --> 02:47:29,849
[SPEAKER_10]: Ooh.

2083
02:47:30,430 --> 02:47:31,471
[SPEAKER_25]: It's Bad Girls.

2084
02:47:32,952 --> 02:47:33,072
[SPEAKER_25]: Ah.

2085
02:47:33,092 --> 02:47:33,793
[SPEAKER_25]: We'll be back after this.

2086
02:50:36,095 --> 02:50:37,716
[SPEAKER_17]: Hi, this is Mel B of RTF.

2087
02:50:38,077 --> 02:50:42,981
[SPEAKER_17]: And for an extra $1.99 a minute, my girlfriend Mel B can join us on all the fun together.

2088
02:50:43,841 --> 02:50:49,806
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey, if you're a broke ass like I am, why don't you come to one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to and still the fun is just as great.

2089
02:50:50,126 --> 02:50:51,988
[SPEAKER_16]: It's Orange Lounge Radio Sunday nights.

2090
02:50:52,574 --> 02:50:57,317
[SPEAKER_16]: Kick it with me and you just might realize the best things in life are free

2091
02:51:18,231 --> 02:51:19,372
[SPEAKER_10]: Welcome!

2092
02:51:19,392 --> 02:51:19,932
[SPEAKER_25]: Welcome!

2093
02:51:20,433 --> 02:51:26,377
[SPEAKER_25]: Melby, actually, he will not be joining the on-air staff because he can't because of where he is physically.

2094
02:51:26,918 --> 02:51:32,762
[SPEAKER_25]: But he will be joining our news staff on OrangeLaunchRadio.com and bringing us news and articles and observations.

2095
02:51:33,343 --> 02:51:39,988
[SPEAKER_25]: And unfortunately, this kind of comes at the cost of DDR Spot, the site he used to work for, is gone.

2096
02:51:40,188 --> 02:51:40,548
[SPEAKER_25]: Bye-bye.

2097
02:51:40,989 --> 02:51:41,849
[SPEAKER_25]: So sorry, DDR Spot.

2098
02:51:41,869 --> 02:51:42,069
[SPEAKER_25]: Bye-bye.

2099
02:51:43,130 --> 02:51:55,033
[SPEAKER_25]: I will hold on to my t-shirt forever even though it's three sizes too big so let's get to some Ask Orange Lounge we don't have a little bit of show left here so let's get to some Ask Orange Lounge

2100
02:52:12,529 --> 02:52:14,971
[SPEAKER_25]: Question from the chat room, will Mel be on the show later?

2101
02:52:15,431 --> 02:52:22,575
[SPEAKER_25]: He will be on the show as much as he can, but unfortunately since he lives like a well over a two hour drive away, it doesn't happen very often.

2102
02:52:22,655 --> 02:52:23,736
[SPEAKER_25]: But we do appreciate when he's here.

2103
02:52:23,936 --> 02:52:26,497
[SPEAKER_25]: We'll try to get him at least on Skype a little more often.

2104
02:52:27,358 --> 02:52:28,219
[SPEAKER_25]: Give us some perspective.

2105
02:52:28,559 --> 02:52:29,900
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright, here we go.

2106
02:52:36,505 --> 02:52:43,210
[SPEAKER_25]: Let's Ask Orange Lounge Some stupid question What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?

2107
02:52:43,570 --> 02:52:50,496
[SPEAKER_25]: Will we find out that we are so very tired because all this prepping for E3 has us really stressed out?

2108
02:52:54,259 --> 02:52:56,400
[SPEAKER_25]: That's the most karaoke I do on this show, by the way.

2109
02:52:56,420 --> 02:53:01,364
[SPEAKER_25]: Illusion wants to know, has anyone seen the movie Crash yet?

2110
02:53:02,225 --> 02:53:02,545
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

2111
02:53:02,565 --> 02:53:02,605
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

2112
02:53:03,115 --> 02:53:04,355
[SPEAKER_25]: I have not, but I want to.

2113
02:53:04,395 --> 02:53:08,597
[SPEAKER_25]: I've heard good things about it, because Illusion, you won't shut up when you tell me about the movie and you say it's good.

2114
02:53:08,877 --> 02:53:14,118
[SPEAKER_25]: But actually, I think my roommate's family or something went to go see it, and they said it was very good.

2115
02:53:14,378 --> 02:53:14,998
[SPEAKER_25]: So I want to see it.

2116
02:53:15,218 --> 02:53:16,399
[SPEAKER_25]: And I saw the trailer, and it looked good.

2117
02:53:16,419 --> 02:53:17,679
[SPEAKER_28]: I want to see Unleashed.

2118
02:53:18,299 --> 02:53:21,420
[SPEAKER_25]: I was actually going to try and go see Crash like two nights ago, but it was too late.

2119
02:53:21,560 --> 02:53:22,701
[SPEAKER_25]: Like, all the theaters were closed.

2120
02:53:23,961 --> 02:53:24,121
[SPEAKER_25]: Man.

2121
02:53:26,089 --> 02:53:31,533
[SPEAKER_25]: Doobs says, were you a jock quarterback giving swirlies to nerds back in high school?

2122
02:53:31,954 --> 02:53:34,676
[SPEAKER_25]: Or an energetic cheerleader, as LemonLimeJump said.

2123
02:53:35,276 --> 02:53:35,997
[SPEAKER_25]: I was neither.

2124
02:53:36,117 --> 02:53:36,978
[SPEAKER_25]: I was a band geek.

2125
02:53:37,118 --> 02:53:38,119
[SPEAKER_25]: I was a band geek too.

2126
02:53:38,199 --> 02:53:41,141
[SPEAKER_25]: Not only was I a band geek, I was in yearbook and student council.

2127
02:53:41,181 --> 02:53:43,243
[SPEAKER_25]: So I guess that kind of makes me a cheerleader.

2128
02:53:43,443 --> 02:53:45,805
[SPEAKER_02]: I was on the chess team and on pep squad.

2129
02:53:46,005 --> 02:53:48,007
[SPEAKER_25]: You have to remember that my role in...

2130
02:53:48,849 --> 02:53:52,070
[SPEAKER_25]: Ranma wants to know, favorite Nintendo character and why?

2131
02:54:20,746 --> 02:54:21,786
[SPEAKER_25]: Link, he's just hot.

2132
02:54:21,806 --> 02:54:22,186
[SPEAKER_25]: Older Link.

2133
02:54:22,206 --> 02:54:23,047
[SPEAKER_25]: That's funny.

2134
02:54:23,067 --> 02:54:23,207
[SPEAKER_25]: Melee 2.

2135
02:54:23,247 --> 02:54:26,708
[SPEAKER_25]: If they do Melee 2, I'm hoping that's like a surprise announcement at E3.

2136
02:54:26,788 --> 02:54:27,248
[SPEAKER_25]: I would just die.

2137
02:54:51,804 --> 02:54:58,249
[SPEAKER_25]: Um, now just tell me... LemonLimeJump wants to know, now just tell me, Liege... Is that a mistype?

2138
02:54:58,289 --> 02:54:58,569
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know.

2139
02:54:58,869 --> 02:55:01,931
[SPEAKER_25]: Just tell me, just how do we know the Earth to be banana-shaped?

2140
02:55:04,233 --> 02:55:05,774
[SPEAKER_28]: Um, I can illustrate that with sheep bladders.

2141
02:55:07,575 --> 02:55:08,716
[SPEAKER_25]: Is that a Hitchhiker's Reference?

2142
02:55:09,076 --> 02:55:09,977
[SPEAKER_28]: No, it's Monty Python.

2143
02:55:10,017 --> 02:55:10,697
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, Monty Python.

2144
02:55:12,158 --> 02:55:12,518
[SPEAKER_28]: My bad.

2145
02:55:15,220 --> 02:55:15,761
[SPEAKER_25]: That's it!

2146
02:55:16,541 --> 02:55:17,562
[SPEAKER_25]: We have all the, um...

2147
02:55:18,957 --> 02:55:20,818
[SPEAKER_25]: We have all the questions we got from our listeners.

2148
02:55:20,998 --> 02:55:21,978
[SPEAKER_25]: That wasn't a whole lot tonight.

2149
02:55:21,998 --> 02:55:22,719
[SPEAKER_25]: They're kind of quiet.

2150
02:55:23,139 --> 02:55:23,719
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

2151
02:55:23,799 --> 02:55:24,460
[SPEAKER_25]: I was going to take that.

2152
02:55:24,720 --> 02:55:27,241
[SPEAKER_25]: This one poor person has been calling into the Skype line like all night long.

2153
02:55:27,261 --> 02:55:27,701
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's take it.

2154
02:55:27,921 --> 02:55:30,522
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, I was going to take it, but he's not on now.

2155
02:55:30,682 --> 02:55:31,423
[SPEAKER_02]: Person call.

2156
02:55:31,743 --> 02:55:33,223
[SPEAKER_25]: You have one minute.

2157
02:55:33,384 --> 02:55:34,304
[SPEAKER_25]: Maybe I should just call him.

2158
02:55:34,564 --> 02:55:35,164
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, go for it.

2159
02:55:35,364 --> 02:55:35,785
[SPEAKER_25]: Sure, why not?

2160
02:55:35,805 --> 02:55:36,505
[SPEAKER_25]: We'll see what happens.

2161
02:55:39,866 --> 02:55:40,847
[SPEAKER_25]: We'll see if he picks up.

2162
02:55:43,608 --> 02:55:43,768
[SPEAKER_25]: Hello?

2163
02:55:43,988 --> 02:55:44,348
[SPEAKER_25]: Hello?

2164
02:55:47,270 --> 02:55:47,550
[SPEAKER_25]: Hello?

2165
02:55:51,297 --> 02:55:54,719
[SPEAKER_25]: We're calling you because you've been calling us all night long and we felt bad.

2166
02:55:57,380 --> 02:55:58,320
[SPEAKER_25]: Please say something.

2167
02:56:00,201 --> 02:56:00,401
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey.

2168
02:56:00,661 --> 02:56:01,361
[SPEAKER_25]: Hey, you're there.

2169
02:56:01,501 --> 02:56:01,822
[SPEAKER_25]: Hi.

2170
02:56:03,302 --> 02:56:03,943
[SPEAKER_25]: Hi, who's this?

2171
02:56:06,964 --> 02:56:08,044
[SPEAKER_15]: RPGKing7.

2172
02:56:08,304 --> 02:56:09,745

02:58:28,559 --> 02:58:29,080
[SPEAKER_25]: You're right.

2205
02:58:29,160 --> 02:58:30,521
[SPEAKER_02]: Good thing I'm not from California.

2206
02:58:30,541 --> 02:58:34,524

2207
02:58:36,325 --> 02:58:39,047
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, it's this process they make you go through, actually.

2213
02:58:55,450 --> 02:58:56,251
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay.

2214
02:58:56,491 --> 02:59:10,277
[SPEAKER_25]: If you want to send us an email, if you want to send us an email and ask us a question about E3, you have something specific you want us to find at the show, what you have to do is send an email to E3...

2215
02:59:11,949 --> 02:59:15,831
[SPEAKER_25]: at OrangeLoungeRadio.com You've got to wait about two minutes.

2216
02:59:15,871 --> 02:59:18,592
[SPEAKER_25]: Don't send it just yet because I'm actually creating the account as we speak.

2217
02:59:18,952 --> 02:59:26,194
[SPEAKER_25]: Send an email to E3 at OrangeLoungeRadio.com This is the email we're going to be checking at E3 and answering the questions on our podcast.

2220
02:59:37,699 --> 02:59:40,420

2221
02:59:40,987 --> 02:59:43,329
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm a mini-disc player and reject false icons.

2222
02:59:54,989 --> 02:59:59,012
[SPEAKER_25]: You know, this whole thing is that happened with the lawsuit and everything.

2223
02:59:59,072 --> 03:00:02,974
[SPEAKER_25]: It's all about protecting what is, you know, Konami.

2224
03:00:03,014 --> 03:00:04,615
[SPEAKER_25]: It's protecting Konami's patents.

2225
03:00:05,136 --> 03:00:10,339
[SPEAKER_25]: And it's all about, you know, what Konami, you know, came up with and everything and people infringing on that.

2226
03:00:12,200 --> 03:00:16,863
[SPEAKER_25]: Very interesting, the kinds of things that, you know, were patented in this whole thing.

2227
03:00:17,243 --> 03:00:17,604
[SPEAKER_25]: Very interesting.

2228
03:00:17,624 --> 03:00:19,905
[SPEAKER_25]: It would be very interesting to see, like, all the different things that Konami's patented.

2229
03:00:21,646 --> 03:00:22,747
[SPEAKER_25]: In regards to DDR, of course.

2230
03:00:23,968 --> 03:00:24,488
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright, that's it.

2231
03:00:25,120 --> 03:00:25,941
[SPEAKER_25]: Have a good one, you guys.

2232
03:00:26,401 --> 03:00:27,302
[SPEAKER_25]: Final word of the show.

2233
03:00:27,362 --> 03:00:30,446
[SPEAKER_25]: I guess since it's just me and you, I'll give it to you because I don't want it.

2234
03:00:38,194 --> 03:00:43,059
[SPEAKER_04]: That does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live.

2238
03:01:09,952 --> 03:01:13,674
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, it's okay to ask the big questions in life.

2239
03:01:14,682 --> 03:01:16,023
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't expect any answers.

2240
03:01:16,083 --> 03:01:20,325
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, don't take it all too... No, wait a minute.

2241
03:01:20,805 --> 03:01:24,006
[SPEAKER_00]: You should always think... No, that's wrong.

2242
03:01:25,447 --> 03:01:29,929
[SPEAKER_00]: No, actually, I don't think I've learned anything.

2243
03:01:31,670 --> 03:01:33,311
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is a lesson in itself.

2244
03:01:36,452 --> 03:01:39,934
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.
