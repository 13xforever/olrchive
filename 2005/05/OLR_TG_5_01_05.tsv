3314	14183	You're tuned in to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your podcast home for all the latest video game news and gamer chat.
14443	17906	Now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.
19605	20965	Hello everybody again.
21106	29188	For another week, we are here with the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, our podcast dedicated to what's going on in the gamer world.
29428	31529	This is information that gamers really want to know about.
32269	34310	And, you know, this week we're famous.
34970	35790	Famous!
35830	36351	Famous!
36391	37131	Do you know me?
37531	38411	I am so famous.
38591	39372	My name is Rob Roberts.
39392	40132	You might know me as Sky.
40172	43793	The famous voices you hear behind me is the lovely Dark Sakura, known as Jamie Summers.
43813	45114	It's because I'm an internet celebrity.
46074	47374	And the one and only Loki.
48075	49075	Just call me The Foot.
50287	51288	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
73405	74586	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
96280	101124	At least, you know, they picked the most toned part of my body to take a picture of my foot.
101384	102985	Although your feet were kind of curving funny.
103005	103746	That was very interesting.
104246	105267	I don't know what happened there.
105387	107569	I was just... I don't know.
107769	111893	So big thanks to Sackbee for filling our media horror ego.
111953	112593	We do love that.
113114	117757	And if anybody else wants to, you know, help us inflate our media horror ego, send us a message.
118378	121560	They sold six more papers the other day.
121580	122321	That's right.
123415	129716	Also, did you guys know that last week we were 1up.com's audio blog of the day at some point last week?
130076	131917	We're even more of an internet celebrity now.
131977	132797	That was just awesome.
132817	134137	So thank you guys over at 1up.com.
134677	137378	I think 1up.com is a neat, neat idea.
137478	138778	I love their community stuff.
138798	141759	And I'm not just saying that because they made us audio blog of the day.
141799	144039	I've actually been a member of the community for longer.
144419	145160	But it's neat.
145380	146360	I was very happy about that.
146640	147820	It's nice to be respected by your peers.
147960	151401	Well, you know, with all these blogs and everything, I'm thinking about starting up a new one on MySpace.
152245	152705	Oh, okay.
152725	154426	Starting up at Orange Lounge on MySpace.
154446	158889	You know, actually, I just found out today at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, we have the capability to do blogs there.
159049	159829	We just don't.
160310	160830	So, I don't know.
160850	161610	We may have to do something.
161770	162251	We'll see, though.
162271	162531	We'll see.
162911	167734	Anyway, enough about us inflating our egos, although we have to take time to inflate our egos once in a while.
168494	172336	And if you want to help inflate our egos, you could vote for us on Podcast Alley.
172516	178399	You know, just do a search for Orange and then vote us on Orange Lounge Radio on PodcastAlley.com.
178960	179060	And...
179704	180845	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
208101	212963	No, I did play a little Luminous, but eh.
213023	215464	I watched Dan beat Metal Gear Acid.
215824	216565	Okay, how was that?
217025	218385	He said that game was trippy and hard.
219006	222507	What do you think of Metal Gear Acid compared to the rest of the series lately?
222607	225148	I'm not into card games, and I'm not into strategy games.
225208	228730	It's more like a real-time strategy, and I don't like those type of things.
228950	231030	So, you know, you're welcome to it.
231050	234872	If you like Fire Emblem and like Metal Gear, you'll like this game.
234892	237113	Fair enough.
237605	238125	That's really it.
238325	238886	Loki, how about you?
239326	243747	First, I'd like to say Metal Gear Acid reminds me of Phantasy Star... Was it a 4?
243907	245348	Phantasy Star Online 4?
246288	247389	It was Volume 3.
247489	247789	Volume 3.
249230	250410	Yes, the card game.
250450	251670	We all remember how that worked.
251771	253771	Well, it worked about just the same for Metal Gear Acid.
253791	257153	Funny enough, with Phantasy Star 4, now they're going back to what worked in 1 and 2.
257333	257873	Funny enough.
258253	261994	Yeah, the card game to things... Ah, you know what?
262955	263675	Buy cards.
264015	265756	If you're going to play a card game, play a card game.
266175	268797	Don't play a game that's a video game that's a card game.
269357	270958	That's just redundant.
271198	271898	That's too much.
272639	278042	Anyways, my week, I played one game, and that one game would be Ridge Racer for the PSP.
278642	287247	And I went through about, oh man, like 13 of the World Tour things.
287328	290029	I'm now on Pro 20, I think.
290689	293051	And I just unlocked the RallyX car.
293948	295429	by beating the minigame.
295449	297009	We got 50,000 points on that.
297149	303912	So I got the Rally-X car, which is so awesome because the Rally-X car is all pixelated just like, you know, the actual game.
303992	307714	And when you use the Nitro Boost, it does these little pixelated clouds behind you.
308734	310915	Oh, just like it did in Rally-X if you played the old game.
310935	311956	Yeah, like the smoke screen.
312236	317158	And that was, I think, it's just little details like that Namco throws in that's awesome.
319069	323870	The race before they had the race, what they called, I guess, the devil car or something like that.
324591	325651	And that sucked.
325711	326491	It was a one-on-one race.
326551	336514	But see, what's really awesome is once you get past Pro 18, it's all like kind of challenge mode type stuff where you have like one-on-one races with stuff to unlock special cars and whatnot.
336674	337714	And those are really cool.
337734	339935	And I've been playing this game like all week.
340015	341795	I mean, it's held my attention that long.
341855	343776	It's just a really, really good game.
344436	344636	Cool.
344696	345136	Anything else then?
347343	348584	That's all I played this week.
348764	349824	I haven't played anything else.
350604	353665	I have kind of a different story than you do for my gaming week.
353725	354686	You were on PSP.
354746	355506	I was on DS.
355986	358467	I picked up a new game called Polarium for the DS.
358827	359547	It's a puzzle game.
359627	360867	I've been looking at that one, too.
360887	361527	Were you looking at that?
362388	363508	That and Mercury for PSP.
364628	366589	I picked up Polarium because I'm a big puzzle game fan.
366689	367289	I loved Luminous.
367309	368469	This goes back to Tetris.
371226	399223	Yoshi's Cookie and Tetris Attack and those types of games too so I picked up Polarium which is basically the concept of Polarium is that you have all these squares so at first glance you might think it's kind of like Luminous but it has nothing to do with it really their games aren't the same at all but you use the stylus you draw lines and that's how you're changing you're swapping tiles and I know that sounds really simple but because you can only draw the lines so fast you actually have to think ahead about how you're going to draw the lines so it sounds like a pretty killer concept huh um
400616	403258	Polarium held my attention for about an hour, and then I was done with it.
404058	405779	I was very disappointed with Polarium.
406039	407060	That's just me personally.
407800	410322	I thought the graphics were boring as heck.
411322	413523	I thought it sounded like garbage.
414624	418886	I thought the puzzles were kind of interesting, but I just didn't like the concept.
418966	420347	I mean, I take that back.
420939	422700	I like the idea of the game.
423141	425222	It kind of makes you go, hmm, could this be a fun puzzle game?
425242	426903	But the execution didn't like it.
427144	428384	I can't recommend this game.
428625	429265	I don't like it at all.
429585	431687	Especially when you put it next to a game such as Luminous.
432928	436330	And I think this might be in some ways DS's answer to Luminous.
436851	439292	But if you think of it that way, you're really going to be disappointed.
439352	443535	This is nothing like... I think Mercury is also going to blow it out of the water too.
444056	446377	Luminous, the bar has been set so high with Luminous, I think.
447258	449860	I'm thinking that Mercury is going to be pretty big though.
450903	451864	I'm curious about Mercure.
451884	455346	I'm also curious about... I'm not giving up on DS just yet because I'm very, very curious about Meteos.
455506	456747	I've heard a lot of good things about that.
457207	458948	I want Smart Bomb.
459208	460329	That's what I've been waiting for.
460349	464131	But Polarium was just... Polarium is the type of game I would have expected.
464151	466513	You know how they have third-party publishers?
466983	469005	DS is going to lose this battle unless things start changing fast.
494529	496109	These games are not impressive.
496229	500610	I know at E3 they're going to announce that stupid internet connectivity or whatever like that.
501110	504351	It's pretty solid.
504391	505351	That's what's going to happen.
506152	516414	I don't think it's going to matter at this point because pretty soon the PSP's already got internet connectivity and they're going to have a web browser probably for that coming out this year.
516594	522355	If the revolution blows everything else out of the water, does the DS have a chance?
524753	525433	I don't know.
525934	532076	They're going to probably do a redesign of it just like they did with the Advance, and it's going to be another game system to buy.
532096	535337	All they need to do is to start putting out some more of their franchise games that are good.
535377	537317	Like, the Metroid demo was pretty nice.
537357	538618	They should put out the Metroid game.
538638	539298	I don't understand.
539318	542759	I know they're probably trying to finish it, but... Okay, okay, here's what I don't understand.
542779	544900	Okay, yeah, you ported Mario 64.
545040	545520	Good for you.
547060	548501	Why didn't you make a new Mario game?
548821	549941	I mean, this is what I'm wondering.
550041	550922	Why didn't you make a new game?
551142	551942	I don't know.
553424	557467	Well, I mean, they altered Mario 64, so it's almost like a whole different game when you play Yoshi and stuff.
557487	558488	We'll get the Game Boy Advance, though.
558508	560409	That's all it was for the most part, is ported games.
560769	563190	Everybody got Pac-Pix out in Japan, and that's not fair.
564851	567273	Pac-Pix is coming out here very, very soon, though, which is exciting.
568294	569634	All right, let's... No, let's go.
569675	569935	I'm sorry.
570155	573557	Actually, I still want the Pac-Man Marble Madness type game.
574537	575297	That needs to hurry up.
575338	576378	Pack and roll.
604588	605889	VIRTUAL BOY PART 2 VIRTUAL BOY PART 2
628035	628636	Pretty much.
628656	630097	Let's have a migraine.
630397	631758	You can pay $30 for it.
631798	633400	The Virtual Boy was kind of a cool idea, though.
633700	634441	I mean, it really was.
634781	638244	But that's the first thing my brain goes to when I hear about this revolution.
638464	641727	It was a good idea too early in its time.
641787	642788	It had fun commercials.
643288	645110	The Virtual Boy, it was a great idea.
645631	647752	Monochrome red, that was a bad point.
647873	650595	And the fact that it wasn't really that much of a portable machine.
650615	653017	You had to kind of sit it down on a table to be able to use it.
653778	654919	So that was the problem.
655882	669368	Now before you laugh this story off, consider that, and this is what the article goes on to say, consider that there have been recent patents filed by Nintendo that kind of support that this is possibly the direction.
669448	673330	Now obviously nothing's confirmed until Nintendo says something themselves, but speculate.
673370	676932	I am going to say that this is probably the case, and here's why I think that.
677776	680157	They have been very quiet about the revolution.
680217	681337	They haven't said anything.
681397	682598	And this is what's going to happen.
682918	686939	You're going to have all this, like, you know, everyone's like, oh, PS3, you know, Xbox 360.
686979	689860	Then it's all, bam, revolution.
689920	699563	Because the Xbox 360 and the PS3, as far as, you know, improving the graphics and stuff, they haven't really done anything new.
700743	705645	But it's also Nintendo's been known for gimmicky type of things.
706977	707498	It'll be interesting.
707518	712940	I'm looking forward to seeing if this is true or not and how this is all going to play out.
715081	717242	It's hard to say until I see it in action, you know what I mean?
717463	723305	The concept sounds interesting, although I really hope they've learned the mistakes from Virtual Boy and that this won't cause seizures and headaches.
724186	727467	I'm wondering if this new 3D stuff, if we'll see a Power Glove 2?
729268	729769	We'll see.
730009	732870	You know that Nintendo licensed the Palm OS.
733951	734231	Hmm.
734847	742634	Yeah, actually, there's supposed to be making a cartridge to where you can run the Palm OS software on your DS.
742974	747218	It's going to be very interesting to see how the DS and the Revolution work together with the 3D projection things.
747238	748920	Will I be able to poke things with my stylus?
749400	758148	No, basically what the 3D projection is, it's going to be stereoscopic 3D, basically just like if you go into an IMAX movie and you have your glasses projected.
758616	760017	That's what you're going to get with this.
760098	762700	It's going to be 3D with glasses, I think.
762740	767184	So you're talking about 3D glasses, not actual hologram projection?
767384	770567	I think we're a little early for holograms.
770587	772208	But that would be revolutionary, would it not?
772268	773169	Yeah, it would.
773529	776352	I guess, would that mean they would not need a TV for that or something?
776932	777272	I don't know.
777773	778173	We'll see.
778233	778734	Whatever.
778774	780495	I mean, hey, whatever they want to do.
780555	782437	I mean, if they've got holograms, hey.
783923	788206	Since Namco got brought up a little earlier in the show several times, I have a couple Namco stories tonight.
788446	791328	And I know this always makes DarkSakura happy because she's a big Namco fan.
793049	799853	What is happening is that Namco is going to be releasing a brand new compilation, yes, another one, for their 50th anniversary.
800313	808237	They are collecting 14 arcade titles and putting it out on PS2, GameCube, Xbox, PC, and GBA.
808298	812260	It's coming out in August and it's called the 50th Anniversary Arcade Collection.
813052	813853	Pac-Man, Ms.
813893	822538	Pac-Man, Galaga, Galaxian, Dig Dug, Pole Positions 1 and 2, Rally X, Rolling Thunder, and more, including Xevious, Mappy, etc.
822578	822958	Mappy!
824279	825760	Been there, done that, with all this.
825800	825940	Mappy!
826260	828501	Why can't I just go out and get the PlayStation 1 discs?
828661	829442	I mean, what big deal?
829462	831363	Well, they need to do what Sega did.
832744	833885	Like, with the Sega Ages.
834365	836046	A lot of people were disappointed in Sega Ages, though.
836066	837667	Well, a lot of people were stupid.
839423	840404	I don't need RallyX.
840564	843906	RallyX is part of Ridge Racer for the PSP.
844906	848729	I could put in Tekken 5 and play Starblade until I'm giddy.
849389	850169	Which I'm already giddy.
850610	855953	I'm a huge retro fan, don't get me wrong, but this is thoroughly uninteresting to me.
856153	856473	I don't know.
857274	863037	They could do all the interviews in the world they want to, but I feel like I did this already ten years ago when the PlayStation came out, and
864025	871031	These games are great, and they hold a space in the arcade game greats of all time, but I'm just not interested in playing them.
871071	873113	I have another retro story.
873193	874454	Okay, sure.
874894	885543	Actually, this is, now, all of you might remember those wonderful, you know, the straight, you hook them up to the TV type of console systems, the flashbacks, what they call them.
885959	888203	Asteroids Breakout, Centipede, Lunar Lander, Millipede, Missile Command, Pong
899349	902651	But amongst 30 others total.
902951	907834	Now the flashbacks are the actual console, not the joystick that you plug in.
907874	908715	It looks like the old Atari.
908755	909495	It looks like a console.
909776	913618	This one, though, it's going to be great because it's going to be wood grain, just like the old ones.
913638	914779	All right.
914859	923965	We were just talking about this because I remember we were talking about the Atari contest and that game Ninja Garden that got created in 24 hours is going to be in this, at least per that last story.
923985	924205	Exactly.
924605	928089	and we were talking about the wood, I believe Jamie said something about it needs to be in the wood grain.
928429	930692	That is so cool if it is coming out in the wood grain.
930732	931733	Coming out this summer.
932013	933295	That totally would make me happy.
933315	935537	Maybe people from Atari were listening to this, huh?
935758	937640	Yeah, this summer, this summer for about $30.
937720	938601	Hey, $30 for Neoclassical Games?
941201	944765	Addressing this at Classic Gaming Expo, because you know that's coming up in a couple months.
944865	945546	Isn't that weird?
945606	952973	I just slammed Namco on the been there, done that attitude, and now here I am getting all giddy about the woodgrain Atari.
953213	956257	It's all about, you know, how you execute it.
956297	957157	That's really what it is.
957218	957858	I guess you're right.
957938	958419	I guess you're right.
958439	963144	Because they've released these Namco collections before, and now they're just releasing it on a new system.
963784	968686	And, for example, I have one of the Namco collections for the GBA already.
969006	971327	They already have these games out in the GBA.
971407	974249	It's just re-releasing the same damn thing again.
974409	981652	Also, one thing, though, about those Namco collections on PS1, you do need to keep in mind that at least two of those are considered ultra-rare now.
982292	986974	You cannot find the M, nor can you find the O. Actually, I take that back.
987034	988535	It was the A and the C. I take that back.
989434	991515	Which I actually, I think I have all of them now.
991915	995157	And then they've released the restricted symbol in Japan.
997278	999059	So actually, those are collector's items.
1000039	1003121	People are not going to be able to find those games on PS1.
1003261	1006622	But not a lot of those games are part of this compilation.
1006963	1010784	Well, even so, they're getting... I never saw Mappy released on one.
1011325	1012665	I thought Mappy was in the first one.
1013406	1014126	Not that I recall.
1014246	1014566	My bad.
1015006	1015967	Actually, it probably was.
1016227	1018048	But even so, you know...
1018812	1019152	Namco Story
1039810	1043233	Another series now going from very old Namco to very new Namco.
1043313	1044414	Katamari Damacy 2.
1045235	1046155	Details released.
1046215	1048817	Nina Daisuke's Katamari Damacy.
1049718	1051620	Translates to We Love Katamari.
1052220	1054382	And it is... Actually, they changed the title for the US.
1054442	1054762	Oh, I'm sorry.
1054782	1057284	It's Everybody Loves Katamari Damacy in Japan.
1057304	1058966	And here it's We Love Katamari Damacy.
1059146	1059867	I just got served.
1060007	1060287	All right.
1060887	1063149	It is going to be called We Love Katamari in North America.
1063710	1065852	And so this game is coming out here for sure.
1065952	1068734	There was still a little bit of a question mark, but it is coming out here.
1070201	1075904	Some great screenshots circulating out there on the internet, and it will be out in 2005, they're saying.
1076344	1083527	New locations, new objects, Eiffel Tower's been spotted, cats, trees, junk, humans.
1083567	1084647	Not to mention the new play modes.
1085188	1091650	Yes, and apparently the co-op mode now is in better levels than just like, it was like an arena in the first one.
1091970	1094151	That was more of a versus.
1094371	1098273	Yeah, for the first one to even have that kind of versus mode in it.
1098809	1102812	was cool, but now Katamari 2 is going to expand on that, and I think that's cool.
1103613	1106755	So this one where you actually, to solve the level, you have to work together.
1107256	1107656	Very cool.
1108056	1109677	And you get to play as some of the cousins, too.
1109697	1110038	Yes, you do.
1110058	1110798	Which is very great.
1111799	1118544	Because the cousins, I mean, there was all these great concepts in Katamari Namashi 1, but they didn't get to develop much of them, I think.
1118644	1124809	So Katamari, I think it's going to be one of those games that, it's going to be one of the big franchise games of the next decade.
1125297	1132179	I'd love to see if it expands bigger than that immediate area, if we actually end up with a world expansion as the camera moves out.
1132619	1133619	We'll see, we'll see.
1134679	1140201	Alright, we're getting a lot of E3 news because E3 is just around the corner, so lots and lots of E3 news.
1140541	1144002	There's a concert that's going to be happening before E3, the Final Fantasy concert.
1144062	1152144	It's More Friends, music from Final Fantasy, and announced, and I am very, very excited about this, not only are the Black Mages going to be playing...
1152711	1161175	But Amiko Shiratori and Riki are going to be there singing their theme songs from Final Fantasy IX and Final Fantasy X. Excellent.
1161215	1162636	Are going to be there singing the songs live.
1162856	1163536	And get this.
1164276	1169619	The opera from Final Fantasy VI is being performed with opera singers.
1171119	1172100	Oh, it's going to be great.
1172280	1173621	I'm so excited about this one.
1173641	1174061	Getting chills.
1174201	1174561	Get this.
1175141	1179083	Tickets still available because this is at the Universal Amphitheater.
1179123	1180864	I guess they changed the name to Gibson Amphitheater.
1181577	1182658	Formally the Universal Amphitheater.
1182698	1184159	Tickets are still available because it's so big.
1184680	1185660	It's the day before, right?
1185821	1186361	Yeah, it's Monday.
1186541	1187182	It's the Monday before.
1187242	1187722	May 16th.
1188222	1188863	Very, very soon.
1189383	1189784	Gotta work.
1190344	1190985	Oh, bummer.
1191805	1193086	I'm really hoping that they tape it.
1193366	1196649	I mean, this is going to be... They haven't even done this in Japan yet.
1196669	1197610	This is going to be huge.
1198350	1200332	I hope they tape it and do a DVD or something.
1201471	1202452	More E3 news.
1202832	1204192	Squeenix, we'll move on with them.
1204232	1206614	They announced what games are going to be showing at E3.
1207394	1212516	Final Fantasy VII, Dirge of Cerebrus is going to be one of their big titles that they're going to be showing.
1213137	1216478	Final Fantasy XII, yet again, because it didn't come out like it was supposed to.
1217679	1219740	Dragon Quest VIII, Journey of the Cursed King.
1220530	1223052	Full Metal Alchemist 2, Curse of the Crimson Elixir.
1223112	1225694	Hopefully that one's going to be better than the first one.
1225734	1228376	Apparently curses are the big thing in the role playing games this year.
1228397	1228757	We'll see.
1229277	1231779	Kingdom Hearts 2, I'm hoping for a playable.
1232380	1233000	That'd be great.
1233040	1234261	I want to see a playable Kingdom Hearts 2.
1235222	1239105	Romancing Saga, can't say I'm a fan of the Saga series.
1239185	1240066	Yeah, sorry.
1240086	1241387	I tried, I tried to.
1241727	1245190	But Front Mission Online, they're going to expand the online series.
1245950	1249931	Front Missions started with the Super Nintendo back when.
1250151	1253732	Interesting enough, Squeenix is saying that they are, and we call them Squeenix.
1253772	1257973	We know it's Square Enix or Squeenix, but we call them Squeenix.
1258673	1262074	On the PC, they have Final Fantasy XI as a game they're going to be showing off.
1262494	1265075	Very strange, considering this game is a couple years old now.
1265135	1269936	So are they going to be showing off the new patches, or could there be a new expansion in the works?
1270176	1270576	I hope so.
1270596	1272377	I think it's probably the new patches.
1273061	1277764	And from what I've heard, I know last year they had like a ballista tournament type thing going on.
1278065	1285790	I think this is going to be the same tournament as they were having in some Hawaii location where it's kind of like a boss battle type thing.
1286690	1287931	I think that's what they're doing with this one.
1288331	1288652	We'll see.
1289332	1291013	Eidos announced their lineup as well.
1291554	1297838	What's going to be interesting is that they're going to be showing the games Hitman, Blood Money, 25 to Life, Commando Strike Force, and...
1298579	1327030	Laura Croft, Tomb Raider Legend I thought that they had officially said no more Tomb Raider games Nope, I saw pictures There are pictures online I think Tomb Raider is done There are pictures online and Laura Croft has bigger boobs as usual I don't doubt that it's really happening I mean Tomb Raider was such a huge franchise but I think it's kind of done I have no interest in Tomb Raider Can you guess where those pictures are at?
1328300	1328480	M.T.V.
1328500	1328640	M.T.V.
1358178	1358519	I don't know.
1358619	1359499	Cookie Cutter TV.
1359800	1362662	I think that there's better sites, but who knows?
1362842	1365184	They might do something to impress me later on, so we'll see.
1365905	1366165	Right.
1367526	1368006	I have faith.
1370288	1371429	E3, also one last story.
1371509	1377794	Yahoo is going to be doing a mobile show, and they're going to be showing Yahoo Poker.
1377834	1382738	They're trying to do this whole cross-platform PC mobile thing, so that should be interesting.
1383959	1386502	Yahoo Poker, because Texas Hold'em is the big thing right now.
1387677	1388137	So we'll see.
1389198	1390659	All right, Orange Lounge Radio.
1390739	1401424	We're not just here to talk about gaming, but we're also here to better your life because, you know, if we talked about games all the time, we would have no time to go out and illegally gamble.
1401964	1404445	So we're here to better your life with some advice.
1404545	1407247	Who better than DarkSakura with her advice column?
1407267	1411149	And DarkSakura, what do you have to share with us tonight?
1412449	1415491	Today's bit of advice is how to wrestle free from an alligator.
1417839	1423280	1.
1418039	1423280	If you were on land, try to get on the alligator's back and put downward pressure on its neck.
1423661	1425501	This will force the head and jaws down.
1426901	1425501	2.
1427381	1428642	Close the alligator's eyes.
1428762	1430422	This will usually make it more sedate.
1431262	1430422	3.
1431382	1433183	If you were attacked, go for the eyes and nose.
1433283	1438264	Use any weapon you have or your fist.
1439624	1443025	If its jaws are closed on something you want to remove, for example, a limb.
1443706	1445086	Tap or punch it on the snout.
1445207	1447767	Alligators often open their mouths when tapped lightly.
1448168	1452569	They may drop whatever it is they have taken hold of and back off.
1453069	1457211	If the alligator gets you in its jaws, you must prevent it from shaking you or rolling over.
1457571	1460172	These instinctual actions cause severe tissue damage.
1460652	1464413	Try to keep the mouth clamped shut so the alligator does not begin shaking.
1465453	1470235	Seek medical attention immediately, even for a small cut or bruise, to treat infection.
1470655	1473176	Alligators have a huge number of pathogens in their mouth.
1474235	1475535	But you know what I always say?
1475855	1476115	What?
1476836	1479956	Don't go freaking swimming in the swamp in Florida.
1481497	1482057	Thank you for that.
1483437	1484317	Always lovely advice.
1486798	1493559	How many of you guys know, quick survey, how many of you guys actually played Neopets previously?
1494000	1494740	Jamie's got her hand raised.
1494760	1495540	It was a long ass time ago.
1495560	1497060	Weren't you into Neopets for a little bit, Loki?
1497080	1498361	Or at least your girlfriend was, wasn't she?
1498501	1499701	My fiance is.
1502429	1503970	I played Neopets for a little while.
1503990	1505030	I'm trying to think way back.
1505450	1510252	I think the closest thing I had that was close to Neopets would have been my Pocket Station.
1510872	1517594	You know that Neopets has been this slowly huge growing thing online, and now they sell this stuff at Claire's and all that stuff.
1517914	1523196	Well, you know, a long time ago, Sony said that they were going to make a Neopets game, but then it just disappeared.
1523256	1523977	Well, guess what?
1525097	1528778	It's coming out now, or at least some new version of the Neopets game.
1529278	1529719	August of 2005...
1531218	1553229	Neopets, The Darkest Fairy The 3D action adventure will follow the characters as they journey through the realm of Neopia I wonder if my Neopets are dead So they're saying it's going to be a third person action adventure You know what's sad?
1555130	1560193	Almost practically every game coming out for the PS2 is action adventure
1561246	1562467	Make More Puzzle Games for the PS2 and Xbox
1586431	1588552	Well, here's an interesting story that ties into that.
1588732	1590173	And games that we used to play.
1590253	1591774	At least I know I did used to play this.
1592315	1593595	But this game got bigger and bigger.
1593695	1597878	Puzzle Pirates is now going to be... This used to be something you could only really get on the internet.
1598318	1599299	It's going to be in stores.
1599359	1600659	It's coming out in stores this week.
1601080	1602000	It's going to be on the shelves.
1602440	1605062	So that's kind of interesting that Puzzle Pirates kind of got bigger like that.
1606743	1608044	And it's going to be selling for $20.
1609545	1610725	Monthly subscription fee $9.95.
1612573	1614194	Puzzle games you can see in Puzzle Pirates.
1614294	1622297	Sword fighting, drinking, sailing, bilge pumping, carpentry, gunnery, distilling, and randomly they have spades in there.
1622757	1629120	And what's interesting about Puzzle Pirates is that it's like the Puzzle Fighter 2 inspired game, the Bejeweled inspired game.
1630081	1633482	But I kind of had fun with Puzzle Pirates when I played it.
1634022	1640685	I thought the interface needed work, but again, before I get the hate mail from the Puzzle Pirates community, it was like two years ago and they were still baiting it when I played it.
1640973	1645035	So I'm sure a lot's changed and it's probably polished now, so I probably should go back and check it out.
1646396	1648337	But I'm glad the game's been successful.
1648457	1649798	I think it was a neat idea.
1650438	1652259	But people are going way too far with the pirate thing.
1652339	1654780	Like, they have conventions where they all go and they dress up as pirates.
1655020	1655240	Arr!
1655440	1656141	Yeah.
1656161	1658262	Almost scary like some of the furry stuff.
1658322	1660043	I don't know, worship Johnny Depp and stuff.
1660063	1660363	I don't know.
1664642	1666823	Movie Studios and their UMDs.
1666883	1668683	Hey, the UMDs are getting bigger and bigger.
1668803	1679767	Fox is very, very close to committing, and the rumor is saying that their lineup would initially include Dodgeball, iRobot, Super Troopers, Predator, and Napoleon Dynamite.
1680527	1681388	Hey, that's cool.
1681668	1683108	Universal, thinking about it.
1683228	1686410	Paramount is investigating it right now.
1686510	1689851	So UMDs look like it could be taking off.
1690271	1690551	Don't know.
1690922	1692423	Loki, I'd say you're the expert on this.
1692443	1693104	This is your industry.
1693144	1694185	What do you think?
1694205	1696006	Yep, they're trying to go this route.
1696406	1698368	They're trying to push this stuff way too much.
1698548	1700269	I have not seen sales figures on UMD.
1700309	1701290	Is it really doing that well?
1702010	1703251	I don't know, to be honest.
1703331	1706514	I mean, I haven't really had anyone requesting UMD movies.
1706674	1717282	We're just trying to push it on these people, but honestly... See, because as far as PSPs go, rental-wise, there's not that many stores renting games for that stuff right now.
1717742	1718663	Because they're...
1719401	1719961	DarkSakura.com
1736736	1738757	that you have a DVD for.
1738797	1739457	I don't get it either.
1739577	1740177	I don't get it.
1740337	1743438	Maybe they're looking for the portable convenience, but you know what?
1743458	1744658	I've got portable convenience.
1744718	1746439	I have a laptop.
1746899	1751940	The only way I can think that this would be probably better is those people that buy portable DVD players.
1753260	1757241	Then you can buy PSP for your kids because they're all, Mommy, Mommy, I want it!
1757421	1759802	And then they have the movies, too, that they can watch.
1760242	1764163	But nowadays, too, you also have all these SUVs and stuff with TVs in their car.
1765155	1770120	Really, what it comes down to is kids need to learn to sit still and shut up and sleep during car rides.
1770280	1778828	I have not heard anything about sales figures on the... I don't know how well they're doing, but apparently, I think... I don't know if it's going to take off, though.
1778968	1782592	I really... I'm really worrying about this.
1782612	1783913	I mean, because it's just like people...
1784366	1791031	We're telling me months back, yeah, DVHS is gonna be the revolution, it's gonna hit the video industry, boo!
1791611	1795654	And I said from day one, I'm like, this thing is gonna fail faster than Laserdisc.
1796314	1799577	And watch, and guess what?
1800537	1801858	DVHS, what's that?
1802018	1804140	Oh, that's right, it's not being made anymore.
1804850	1806671	I would really like to hear from our listeners.
1806751	1810814	If you are somebody who is supporting the UMD and you're buying movies on UMD, we want to know why.
1811134	1813336	Send us an email, 2go at orangelawnradio.com.
1813596	1816098	And I'm not, you know, we're not trying to say, like, oh, you're a bad person for doing it.
1816118	1817579	We just want to know, you know, what's the draw?
1817599	1818339	What's the appeal to you?
1818399	1818980	Because we don't see it.
1819020	1823162	I mean, I got Spider-Man 2 with my PSP because I got the neat little bundle thing.
1824383	1827225	I would never see myself actually buying this or paying for this.
1828226	1830787	And it really, I don't know.
1830827	1833009	It's just not anything I would spend money on.
1834470	1834630	Right.
1836642	1838003	DarkSakura, did you have anything you wanted to add?
1838563	1841646	Well, I'm actually looking for the sales figures.
1841706	1846410	I thought that there would be a financial report out already, but I haven't found one yet.
1846510	1848131	Okay, I'm sure we'll see something on the next show.
1848151	1849793	Studios, here's what you need to be doing.
1849993	1852115	And trust me, this is the greatest idea right here.
1852675	1861463	Because everybody, at least this is what I've been using my large memory stick for, TV episodes.
1862589	1863009	and so on.
1888170	1892112	15 minutes, I watch my robot chickens, and I watch my family guy.
1892612	1893132	And there you go.
1893192	1896214	That's just enough time to sit down and watch this really quick.
1896314	1897294	Alright, I see where you're going with that.
1897414	1898215	Okay, okay.
1898675	1899255	Interesting idea.
1899775	1900976	That's what I think they need to be doing.
1901016	1904558	TV shows instead of movies in UMD format.
1904598	1905858	Because the internet's doing it already.
1906118	1907559	Like you just said, you've already done it.
1908089	1910010	The Silent Hill Movie has begun filming.
1936933	1939934	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1958317	1964383	A lot of the scenes from the actual game are showing up in the movie, so they're definitely having that tie.
1964423	1970468	In fact, it's actually already looking better to be better associated with the universe than, say, the Resident Evil movies were.
1970888	1972290	But it's looking very good so far.
1972330	1974271	They've definitely got the feel down.
1975372	1984561	So far on the cast they have, I guess it's pronounced Radha Mitchell from Finding Neverland as Rose, who is the main character.
1985260	1987201	As her daughter, they have Jodell Ferlin.
1987241	1991422	And as her husband, they have Sean Bean, who was Boromir in Fellowship of the Rings.
1991682	1993362	And Yui Bull is not directing this, right?
1993702	1993962	Oh, no.
1994242	1994562	Oh, no.
1994582	1994922	Oh, phew.
1995262	1995523	Oh, no.
1996483	1998363	I had who it was a moment ago.
1998463	2000364	I want to say it was the guy that did Brotherhood of the Wolf.
2000444	2001264	Yes, you're correct.
2001284	2002584	Kristoff something.
2003404	2003664	I don't know.
2004605	2009106	So, I really have high hopes for this.
2009286	2012687	And I hope, I kind of hope that Akira Yamaoka gets to do the music.
2012747	2013927	To really keep it up, yeah.
2016122	2019624	Christoph Gans is the director.
2022486	2024067	Production company Davis Films.
2026629	2028030	Roger Avery is the scripting.
2028670	2032893	Makeup by Paul Jones, who did Resident Evil Apocalypse.
2033654	2034855	But he's doing the gore effects.
2035075	2039718	And the guy who did Underworld is doing the creatures.
2040526	2045470	Well, I guess, although I don't know how much I'd want this movie to have in common with Underworld.
2045490	2048713	The budget at present is $45 to $50 million.
2048733	2050414	That's a lot of faith in this movie.
2050434	2052877	That's about $25,000 a day for production.
2054778	2055879	I have high hopes for this movie.
2055899	2057761	I really hope they get it right.
2058581	2061184	Really, we need a good video game movie.
2061204	2062164	We really do.
2062365	2064106	Please don't screw this up, you guys.
2064566	2065127	Pretty please.
2065592	2066513	Thank you for watching!
2079827	2080567	Let's wrap it up.
2080868	2083149	Let's go around and give everybody's final words for tonight.
2083209	2084329	Oh, one last thing I did want to add.
2084710	2088692	If you notice our sound is a little bit different tonight, that's because we're actually in a new studio.
2089092	2091153	So we had to kind of redo everything.
2091473	2092834	We went through a move here locally.
2093674	2094995	So we redid all our chords.
2095015	2096356	So our sound is a little different.
2097036	2098037	Tell us what you guys think.
2098197	2099898	If you think we should tweak it or whatever.
2100398	2102119	2go at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
2102159	2102799	T-O-G-O.
2103140	2106301	So you thought that you got rid of something from the old studio.
2106401	2107502	No, you found it, didn't you?
2109063	2110263	A little stuffed ferret.
2110863	2111303	Hooray.
2111463	2113184	They found a way back.
2113944	2116164	I thought I buried that in the deepest, darkest box.
2116244	2116804	All right, anyway.
2117505	2118665	Final thoughts, Loki.
2119405	2124226	I forgot to mention this on the three-hour show that we do, but here's something I'd like to mention.
2124246	2125186	Fine.
2125386	2130847	I went to see the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, the movie that came out recently, and there's people wearing towels.
2131327	2137648	Now, granted, I know that this is part of the book, and people, you know, they're fans of the book, and they want to dress up for stuff.
2138342	2140143	I have a big problem with this.
2140543	2141643	It's a movie.
2141743	2143024	It's not a convention.
2143104	2144564	It does not require cosplay.
2144664	2147105	I hate the people that dress up like Star Wars characters.
2147145	2147626	Now, wait a minute.
2147666	2152107	As someone who did Rocky Horror Picture Show a couple times... Okay, there's a little difference.
2152307	2156429	There's a difference between participating in the movie and going to watch a movie in costume.
2156509	2157509	Okay, that's a little different.
2158370	2160390	Star Wars is not a participation movie.
2160430	2161791	No, it's not a participation movie.
2161811	2166953	And all these people dress up and they're in character and stuff like that.
2167349	2172671	and I have problems with that, the Matrix people and the Lord of the Rings people because you all do this.
2172751	2175492	And we have the Star Wars people with their lightsabers.
2175872	2176312	Exactly.
2176452	2178372	I hate these people and they're so annoying.
2178693	2182914	They are goddamn annoying and they just, ugh.
2182954	2183514	They bug me.
2183614	2190536	The hardcore people ruined the Phantom Menace for me because they cheered at every reference and I was missing dialogue because they just would not be quiet.
2190696	2192237	I do have to say something in their favor.
2192397	2192657	Okay.
2193297	2195918	When we were in line for the Phantom Menace, it's actually better than the movie.
2196596	2199638	This was at the theater in Roseville with the trees everywhere.
2200059	2206123	And people pulled out of line, brought out their lightsabers, and had an impromptu duel under the trees with the lights behind them.
2206163	2208685	So all you saw was their silhouettes and the glowing lightsaber.
2209285	2210346	And that was better than the movie.
2211267	2213549	You have to admit, though, that's pretty geeky.
2213569	2215230	That was geeky, but it was awesome.
2215270	2217151	Do you think either one of them got laid that night?
2217972	2218432	Who cares?
2218472	2219273	They were cool for five minutes.
2219293	2220133	You know what I love?
2220574	2221935	I love the people that wait in line.
2222858	2225639	DarkSakura, your final thought My final thought is I have a headache
2251960	2277008	and my final thought would be here take two of these and call me in the morning alright thank you guys so much for downloading us subscribing to us and checking us out we will see you next time on the Orange Lounge Radio to go edition have a good one that's the end of another Orange Lounge Radio to go edition this podcast is a proud part of www.orangeloungeradio.com see you next update
