1
00:00:00,589 --> 00:00:07,934
[SPEAKER_22]: It's like that, y'all, but we don't quit, you keep on rockin', cause this is it!

2
00:00:39,113 --> 00:00:44,869
[SPEAKER_05]: The following live program is a special presentation of Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:56,858 --> 00:01:25,263
[SPEAKER_27]: On tonight's episode of Orange Lounge Radio, episode 144 All three of us are back together again For the first time in a couple weeks And it's really the first time we're all together since E3 And although you guys are probably sick of hearing about it We're not done talking about E3 So we'll probably have a little bit more on that Only a little bit though, because we have other stories to move on to tonight Including what happens when Konami puts up a seemingly important poll

4
00:01:26,314 --> 00:01:29,596
[SPEAKER_27]: Of course, somebody's gotta go and fuck it up for everybody else.

5
00:01:30,457 --> 00:01:32,018
[SPEAKER_27]: We'll have more after this.

6
00:01:43,787 --> 00:01:49,191
[SPEAKER_23]: Orange Lounge Radio is presented in the TMI sound format.

7
00:02:03,788 --> 00:02:08,092
You're listening to Orange Line Radio Live.

8
00:02:08,112 --> 00:02:09,474
This is not a talk radio.

9
00:02:09,514 --> 00:02:10,535
It's so much more.

10
00:02:31,489 --> 00:02:32,394
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, God.

11
00:02:32,635 --> 00:02:33,358
[SPEAKER_25]: Call me Daddy.

12
00:02:36,853 --> 00:02:40,355
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge may contain adult content.

13
00:02:40,896 --> 00:02:44,658
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge may contain many four-letter words.

14
00:02:45,419 --> 00:02:48,921
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity.

15
00:02:49,241 --> 00:02:55,685
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge may contain plenty of... Just kidding.

16
00:02:55,785 --> 00:02:59,508
[SPEAKER_27]: Orange Lounge Radio will not contain any of that in this episode.

17
00:02:59,808 --> 00:03:01,429
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, isn't that special?

18
00:03:05,985 --> 00:03:24,437
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Lounge Radio Live is a fully interactive program via our website at www.orangeloungeradio.com And now, here are your hosts for Orange Lounge Radio Live, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.

19
00:03:26,859 --> 00:03:29,160
[SPEAKER_27]: We are live!

20
00:03:29,861 --> 00:03:30,801
[SPEAKER_27]: And this is episode number 144! 144!

21
00:03:33,322 --> 00:03:40,688
[SPEAKER_27]: For this, May the 29th of 2005, you're tuned in to Orange Lounge Radio, radio that gamers really want.

22
00:03:41,028 --> 00:03:49,714
[SPEAKER_27]: And this is Orange Lounge Radio Live, your home for all the news and discussion on rhythm and music games, as well as the gamer community and the pop culture world.

23
00:03:50,215 --> 00:03:56,179
[SPEAKER_27]: We're plugged in and fully interactive through our website at www.orangeloungeradio.com.

24
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,561
[SPEAKER_27]: My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky.

25
00:03:58,681 --> 00:04:00,903
[SPEAKER_27]: Joining me, as always, are my awesome co-hosts,

26
00:04:01,303 --> 00:04:06,091
[SPEAKER_27]: In this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm, say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

27
00:04:15,436 --> 00:04:20,141
[SPEAKER_21]: Random News, and apparently they're taking a vigilante justice against online scam fights.

28
00:04:20,321 --> 00:04:23,264
[SPEAKER_27]: I've heard about that, and that's almost worth talking about a little later tonight.

29
00:04:23,464 --> 00:04:23,824
[SPEAKER_21]: I agree.

30
00:04:23,945 --> 00:04:27,868
[SPEAKER_27]: The intro does say we don't have to just talk about rhythm and music games.

31
00:04:28,429 --> 00:04:33,494
[SPEAKER_27]: This is why we changed my little script here in the beginning, because now we can talk about the pop culture world when we feel like it.

32
00:04:33,995 --> 00:04:34,495
[SPEAKER_27]: And we do.

33
00:04:34,855 --> 00:04:36,157
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah.

34
00:04:36,457 --> 00:04:36,897
[SPEAKER_27]: Often.

35
00:04:37,298 --> 00:04:38,419
[SPEAKER_27]: Hey, I haven't introduced you yet.

36
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:38,839
[SPEAKER_27]: Be quiet.

37
00:04:40,506 --> 00:04:42,187
[SPEAKER_27]: You're not here until we introduce you.

38
00:04:42,888 --> 00:04:45,369
[SPEAKER_27]: Not that Orange Lounge Radio doesn't ever get random anyway.

39
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:47,030
[SPEAKER_27]: That's random.

40
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:48,051
[SPEAKER_27]: That's why people know us.

41
00:04:48,151 --> 00:04:48,931
[SPEAKER_27]: No.

42
00:04:49,312 --> 00:04:51,933
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright, let me introduce the one and only Techmaster Loki.

43
00:04:52,634 --> 00:04:53,734
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't want to talk now.

44
00:04:54,175 --> 00:04:54,955
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, I see how it is.

45
00:04:55,335 --> 00:04:56,256
[SPEAKER_27]: You're going to be like that, huh?

46
00:04:56,876 --> 00:04:57,477
[SPEAKER_27]: Exactly.

47
00:04:58,017 --> 00:04:58,297
[SPEAKER_27]: Fine.

48
00:04:58,718 --> 00:04:59,098
[SPEAKER_27]: Whatever.

49
00:04:59,858 --> 00:05:03,981
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright, we should have a... It's going to be a mediocre show tonight.

50
00:05:04,981 --> 00:05:05,842
[SPEAKER_27]: It'll be a slightly average.

51
00:05:05,862 --> 00:05:06,883
[SPEAKER_27]: You're never mediocre!

52
00:05:08,271 --> 00:05:09,532
[SPEAKER_27]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

53
00:05:31,267 --> 00:05:36,069
[SPEAKER_27]: I hope it's not the weird remix It's not that freaky remix that was on the I think so, I think it is

54
00:06:03,105 --> 00:06:07,069
[SPEAKER_27]: It's related to Dead EDR, so we have to give it its three seconds of glory.

55
00:06:08,551 --> 00:06:08,891
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright.

56
00:06:10,512 --> 00:06:13,755
[SPEAKER_27]: It's one of Miklatov's favorites, too, so if he heard you saying this, he'd probably cry.

57
00:06:13,775 --> 00:06:15,497
[SPEAKER_21]: I know, and I didn't like it.

58
00:06:15,817 --> 00:06:16,558
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright.

59
00:06:16,758 --> 00:06:18,060
[SPEAKER_21]: I like the original.

60
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:20,682
[SPEAKER_27]: And I hate the Yorain remix, too.

61
00:06:21,042 --> 00:06:22,524
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, we're not playing the Yorain remix.

62
00:06:22,824 --> 00:06:23,545
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank God.

63
00:06:23,665 --> 00:06:25,727
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't know, maybe at the end of the show, just for you.

64
00:06:26,648 --> 00:06:27,028
[SPEAKER_27]: We'll see.

65
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,044
[SPEAKER_27]: All right, so we got all that fun stuff coming up.

66
00:06:30,265 --> 00:06:35,236
[SPEAKER_26]: And, if you want to, I have some of the Dance Stage Unleashed 2 tracks.

67
00:06:35,437 --> 00:06:36,860
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, yes, we have to do some of those as well.

68
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:45,813
[SPEAKER_26]: Dancing Stage Unleashed 2, and, and, and, that song that I brought that's sorta kinda, it's Borderline Remix.

69
00:06:46,153 --> 00:06:47,775
[SPEAKER_27]: It's the Metal Gear Acid song, right?

70
00:06:47,955 --> 00:06:48,235
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah.

71
00:06:48,295 --> 00:06:49,096
[SPEAKER_27]: Ooh, we gotta hear that.

72
00:06:49,316 --> 00:06:52,499
[SPEAKER_27]: I think a lot of our fanboys and fangirls would appreciate that.

73
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:56,103
[SPEAKER_26]: They would like to hear it, and it's not quite a remix.

74
00:06:56,263 --> 00:07:01,088
[SPEAKER_26]: I kinda thought about remixing it, and I'm kinda on, you know... Alright, way to hype it up.

75
00:07:01,368 --> 00:07:01,888
[SPEAKER_26]: Way to hype it up.

76
00:07:01,968 --> 00:07:04,290
[SPEAKER_26]: It's really awesome, I just, you know, see what I mean?

77
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:09,354
[SPEAKER_26]: It's one of those songs that's so awesome, it's like, you know, I don't know if I want to touch it, because I don't want to make it worse than it is.

78
00:07:09,514 --> 00:07:15,058
[SPEAKER_27]: See what I mean about tonight being a real, just average show, because Loki's just like, yeah, I got this song, it's okay.

79
00:07:15,798 --> 00:07:17,379
[SPEAKER_27]: It is never average!

80
00:07:19,641 --> 00:07:21,002
[SPEAKER_21]: Damn it, you're supposed to make us look good.

81
00:07:21,022 --> 00:07:21,582
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright, I know.

82
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:24,024
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, I know I always look good.

83
00:07:25,424 --> 00:07:27,165
[SPEAKER_27]: And you're looking okay with that haircut.

84
00:07:27,185 --> 00:07:27,826
[SPEAKER_27]: You're looking average.

85
00:07:27,846 --> 00:07:29,607
[SPEAKER_27]: My haircut... Loki, you look okay.

86
00:07:29,867 --> 00:07:31,428
[SPEAKER_27]: Actually, Loki, you're a little bit below average.

87
00:07:31,468 --> 00:07:33,609
[SPEAKER_27]: But luckily, I'm here to bring you up.

88
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:36,091
[SPEAKER_21]: My haircut is bad.

89
00:07:36,792 --> 00:07:37,732
[SPEAKER_27]: Ah, no, I like the haircut.

90
00:07:37,772 --> 00:07:38,553
[SPEAKER_27]: It's too short.

91
00:07:39,753 --> 00:07:40,934
[SPEAKER_27]: But it's very, very red.

00:07:49,711 --> 00:07:51,853
[SPEAKER_27]: A potpourri of Bomani music for you guys.

96
00:07:52,594 --> 00:07:56,079
[SPEAKER_27]: Starting it off with some Rainbow Flyer because I haven't heard that song in a while and I like that one.

97
00:07:56,259 --> 00:07:57,941
[SPEAKER_27]: Remember 2DX8 style Rainbow Flyer?

98
00:07:58,361 --> 00:07:58,782
[SPEAKER_27]: It's cute.

99
00:07:59,903 --> 00:08:00,264
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah.

100
00:08:00,764 --> 00:08:03,628

111
00:15:46,802 --> 00:15:47,202
[SPEAKER_27]: No, it's not.

112
00:15:49,845 --> 00:15:50,205
[SPEAKER_27]: Damn it.

113
00:15:50,325 --> 00:15:51,086
[SPEAKER_27]: I hate it when I do that.

114
00:15:51,767 --> 00:15:52,607
[SPEAKER_27]: Orange Lounge Radio.

115
00:15:53,028 --> 00:15:54,049
[SPEAKER_27]: We're on the air.

116
00:15:54,089 --> 00:15:54,309
[SPEAKER_27]: What?

117
00:15:54,329 --> 00:15:55,570
[SPEAKER_21]: I hate when you do that, too.

118
00:15:55,911 --> 00:15:56,151
[SPEAKER_27]: I know.

119
00:15:56,171 --> 00:15:57,672
[SPEAKER_21]: You really buzz the shit out of me.

120
00:15:57,752 --> 00:16:00,335
[SPEAKER_27]: I really... I have screwed up the show so much.

121
00:16:01,096 --> 00:16:01,656
[SPEAKER_27]: It's okay.

122
00:16:01,776 --> 00:16:03,058
[SPEAKER_27]: But it's an okay show today.

123
00:16:03,098 --> 00:16:05,320
[SPEAKER_21]: Next week, we're replacing Rob with a tuna.

124
00:16:06,834 --> 00:16:07,534
[SPEAKER_27]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

125
00:16:32,128 --> 00:16:32,448
[SPEAKER_27]: Onion Flavored

126
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:58,422
[SPEAKER_27]: Never any alcoholic drinks at the Orange Lawn Radio staff meetings ever.

127
00:16:58,602 --> 00:17:00,263
[SPEAKER_27]: Just onions.

128
00:17:01,064 --> 00:17:08,069
[SPEAKER_27]: So I queued it up to start at 4, so I had the whole playlist and my player program ready to go, and I started it at the top of the list.

129
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:25,102
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, the problem was that the top of my screen wasn't really the top of the list, so I actually started at 4 o'clock, what was supposed to be at 4.30, and so everything ran like a half hour early, which caused a great panic when we got home from the staff meeting, and I realized, oh crap, the pre-show's almost over, but it's only 6 o'clock.

130
00:17:27,321 --> 00:17:28,602
[SPEAKER_27]: One of many ways I'm screwing up tonight.

131
00:17:28,902 --> 00:17:29,823
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, thank you, chatroom.

132
00:17:29,983 --> 00:17:31,164
[SPEAKER_27]: Chatroom's saying, uh, FIRED!

133
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:32,405
[SPEAKER_27]: For me.

134
00:17:32,565 --> 00:17:32,865
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

135
00:17:33,366 --> 00:17:33,886

140
00:17:46,615 --> 00:17:47,576
[SPEAKER_27]: Can we get him a microphone?

141
00:17:47,656 --> 00:17:48,617
[SPEAKER_27]: Do I have to give him mine here?

142
00:17:49,938 --> 00:17:52,460
[SPEAKER_27]: The one and only Arcadian42, ladies and gentlemen.

143
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:53,100
[SPEAKER_24]: Hello.

144
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:53,861
[SPEAKER_24]: How are you doing?

145
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:54,962
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm doing okay.

146
00:17:55,222 --> 00:17:56,123
[SPEAKER_24]: My computer's not.

147
00:17:56,163 --> 00:17:56,683
[SPEAKER_24]: That's why I'm here.

148
00:17:57,068 --> 00:18:01,232
[SPEAKER_27]: Wow, I'm liking this new studio because on the new mic you're actually really loud.

149
00:18:01,612 --> 00:18:01,933
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright.

150
00:18:01,953 --> 00:18:02,613
[SPEAKER_27]: Which is good.

151
00:18:03,154 --> 00:18:03,554
[SPEAKER_27]: Awesome.

152
00:18:04,215 --> 00:18:06,497
[SPEAKER_27]: I think he's loud only because we broke the mic.

153
00:18:07,378 --> 00:18:07,818
[SPEAKER_27]: Maybe.

154
00:18:08,959 --> 00:18:12,883
[SPEAKER_27]: You gotta watch the yelling tonight, Loki, because you might blow out somebody's speakers.

155
00:18:13,604 --> 00:18:15,746
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh no, I'll just get distorted beyond all hell.

156
00:18:16,326 --> 00:18:19,089
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, because obviously you can't get louder than this, you know.

157
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:20,826
[SPEAKER_26]: That's set to go.

158
00:18:21,006 --> 00:18:22,107
[SPEAKER_26]: So, whatever.

159
00:18:22,507 --> 00:18:22,808
[SPEAKER_26]: Alright.

160
00:18:23,088 --> 00:18:24,829
[SPEAKER_27]: We are going to get into How Is Your Week, How Is Your Day.

161
00:18:24,869 --> 00:18:30,534
[SPEAKER_27]: But first, I think it's very important that we do an Orange Lounge Radio News Update.

162
00:18:30,594 --> 00:18:32,515
[SPEAKER_27]: Because this is big news.

163
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:33,716
[SPEAKER_27]: This is really big news.

164
00:18:34,877 --> 00:18:37,860
[SPEAKER_27]: Hey, this isn't a music update.

165
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:40,942
[SPEAKER_27]: Orange Lounge Radio News Update.

166
00:18:43,124 --> 00:18:44,165
[SPEAKER_26]: You are too loud.

167
00:18:45,025 --> 00:18:45,986
[SPEAKER_26]: Actually, we're all too loud.

168
00:18:47,127 --> 00:18:47,828
[SPEAKER_27]: Effective...

169
00:18:49,102 --> 00:18:50,343
[SPEAKER_27]: May 28th-ish?

170
00:18:50,944 --> 00:18:51,364
[SPEAKER_27]: 28th?

171
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:57,570
[SPEAKER_27]: Earlier this week, effective earlier this week, both DarkSakura and I have quit Final Fantasy XI.

172
00:18:59,298 --> 00:19:00,259
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, we have.

173
00:19:00,299 --> 00:19:03,100
[SPEAKER_27]: Got up and left and quit for good.

174
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:05,201
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, screw that game.

175
00:19:05,601 --> 00:19:06,882
[SPEAKER_27]: Hey, screw off.

176
00:19:07,262 --> 00:19:11,364
[SPEAKER_27]: Leaving poor Loki all by himself in the world of Vanadil.

177
00:19:12,425 --> 00:19:13,986
[SPEAKER_26]: And he's enjoying every second of it.

178
00:19:14,026 --> 00:19:15,226
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, screw off.

179
00:19:15,347 --> 00:19:17,948
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, but we have PS Opium to keep us happy.

180
00:19:18,328 --> 00:19:18,708
[SPEAKER_27]: You know what?

181
00:19:18,928 --> 00:19:21,750
[SPEAKER_27]: And it's weird because I'm not even that into Blue Burst.

182
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:24,932
[SPEAKER_27]: Like, it's cool and all, but let's face it, Jamie.

183
00:19:25,772 --> 00:19:28,774
[SPEAKER_27]: It's freaking PSO, again.

184
00:19:29,955 --> 00:19:31,075
[SPEAKER_27]: For the fourth time.

185
00:19:31,195 --> 00:19:34,577
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, but I can play it while doing my homework and actually get to a different window.

186
00:19:34,617 --> 00:19:36,498
[SPEAKER_27]: But Jamie, did they give us new classes?

187
00:19:36,658 --> 00:19:37,219
[SPEAKER_27]: No.

188
00:19:37,339 --> 00:19:39,200
[SPEAKER_27]: Did they give us new skins for our characters?

189
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,060
[SPEAKER_27]: No.

190
00:19:40,421 --> 00:19:43,422
[SPEAKER_27]: Did they give us the type of voice support that Xbox Live had?

191
00:19:43,862 --> 00:19:44,163
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

192
00:19:44,223 --> 00:19:44,463
[SPEAKER_08]: Eventually.

193
00:19:46,044 --> 00:19:46,504
[SPEAKER_27]: Eventually?

194
00:19:46,524 --> 00:19:47,124
[SPEAKER_27]: They're working on it.

195
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:49,646
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, well we don't have it yet, so not yet, okay?

196
00:19:51,158 --> 00:19:57,820
[SPEAKER_27]: The only cool thing about PSO Bloober so far, other than the fact that it is PSO, and PSO is a pretty decent game, you can play it in a window.

197
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:00,181
[SPEAKER_27]: So I can talk on aim.

198
00:20:00,501 --> 00:20:03,762
[SPEAKER_27]: Feasibly, you can cyber sex and play PSO at the same time, if you're into that.

199
00:20:04,423 --> 00:20:05,663
[SPEAKER_27]: Not that I would know anything about that.

200
00:20:06,223 --> 00:20:07,584
[SPEAKER_26]: Me neither.

201
00:20:08,384 --> 00:20:09,884
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, you can do that with Final Fantasy II.

202
00:20:09,924 --> 00:20:14,406
[SPEAKER_26]: In fact, you can actually play two sessions of Final Fantasy at the same time.

203
00:20:14,946 --> 00:20:16,447
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't know why you'd want to, but you could.

204
00:20:17,307 --> 00:20:19,068
[SPEAKER_26]: One on the PlayStation 2 and one on the PC?

205
00:20:19,248 --> 00:20:19,868
[SPEAKER_26]: No, two on the PC.

206
00:20:23,137 --> 00:20:23,497
[SPEAKER_27]: I heard about that!

207
00:20:41,055 --> 00:20:46,057
[SPEAKER_27]: But I, you mean, you know, and a lot of people go, how can they kill Morpheus?

208
00:20:46,197 --> 00:20:50,839
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, easy, here's how you can kill Morpheus, because you can make him come back, just like they're going to make Neo come back.

209
00:20:50,879 --> 00:20:54,141
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, and then the other thing is that, what are you worried about, a new movie?

210
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:56,682
[SPEAKER_27]: Ha, not going to happen, sorry.

211
00:20:58,663 --> 00:21:01,864
[SPEAKER_27]: I know this is a newsflash to anybody, but the third Matrix movie sucked.

212
00:21:02,124 --> 00:21:04,305
[SPEAKER_26]: Therefore, there will not be any more Matrix movies.

213
00:21:04,325 --> 00:21:06,486
[SPEAKER_26]: Actually, correction, the second movie sucked.

214
00:21:06,986 --> 00:21:10,108
[SPEAKER_26]: The third movie was just kind of... Let's face it, as a whole...

215
00:21:10,911 --> 00:21:11,371
[SPEAKER_27]: It sucked.

216
00:21:14,914 --> 00:21:15,995
[SPEAKER_27]: It's kind of like Tonight Show.

217
00:21:16,035 --> 00:21:16,456
[SPEAKER_27]: It's average.

218
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:33,071
[SPEAKER_27]: Comment from our chatroom there.

219
00:21:33,331 --> 00:21:37,253
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm apparently pissing off some of the Final Fantasy XI fans with my... Damn straight!

220
00:21:37,473 --> 00:21:39,153
[SPEAKER_26]: But see, here's where the kicker is.

221
00:21:39,213 --> 00:21:43,275
[SPEAKER_26]: Because he gave me all of his stuff, and he's like, don't sell this because I might come back.

222
00:21:43,575 --> 00:21:45,236
[SPEAKER_26]: First thing I did is sold all of it.

223
00:21:47,077 --> 00:21:50,779
[SPEAKER_27]: Ass.

224
00:21:50,819 --> 00:21:51,639
[SPEAKER_27]: Mic check.

225
00:21:52,099 --> 00:21:55,341
[SPEAKER_21]: And people wonder why I didn't give my stuff away.

226
00:21:55,621 --> 00:21:56,281
[SPEAKER_21]: I just quit.

227
00:21:57,282 --> 00:21:57,762
[SPEAKER_27]: That's fine.

228
00:21:57,842 --> 00:21:59,703
[SPEAKER_27]: Because when I come back, they'll have PvP.

229
00:22:01,682 --> 00:22:02,603
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm never coming back.

230
00:22:02,663 --> 00:22:03,263
[SPEAKER_21]: I've decided.

231
00:22:03,643 --> 00:22:04,824
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, but here's the thing.

232
00:22:04,884 --> 00:22:11,767
[SPEAKER_27]: Somebody jaded 2005 saying, PSO and Final Fantasy, both are good, so don't quit one and go solely to another.

233
00:22:12,367 --> 00:22:14,748
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm actually not solely playing Phantasy Star Online.

234
00:22:14,788 --> 00:22:15,909
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm also playing Guild Wars.

235
00:22:16,769 --> 00:22:19,551
[SPEAKER_21]: And I'm going to be quitting all of it when Ragnarok 2 comes out.

236
00:22:20,611 --> 00:22:22,032
[SPEAKER_27]: Actually, here's...

237
00:22:23,485 --> 00:22:24,646
[SPEAKER_27]: Here's the idea behind it.

238
00:22:24,746 --> 00:22:30,150
[SPEAKER_27]: Guild Wars, a lot of my friends are into right now, and I basically got bullied into checking it out.

239
00:22:30,611 --> 00:22:33,433
[SPEAKER_27]: And I do like the idea that you don't have to pay a monthly fee.

240
00:22:33,733 --> 00:22:41,179
[SPEAKER_27]: I gotta admit, that's a big draw, because Final Fantasy XI, here I am paying $15.95 a month for three characters I'm never gonna use, right?

241
00:22:43,122 --> 00:22:45,324
[SPEAKER_27]: Why do you have three characters?

242
00:22:45,785 --> 00:22:47,146
[SPEAKER_27]: I had two of them.

243
00:22:58,935 --> 00:23:00,457
[SPEAKER_27]: And I wasn't, what, 18?

244
00:23:00,777 --> 00:23:04,921
[SPEAKER_27]: So I had my main character, my mule, and then I had a character on another server.

245
00:23:05,222 --> 00:23:09,146
[SPEAKER_27]: Because you can't server hop in Final Fantasy XI, so once you're on one server, you're stuck on it.

246
00:23:09,546 --> 00:23:16,333
[SPEAKER_27]: So, somebody who I've been getting to know lately happens to have a level 75 character and really wants to play with me.

247
00:23:16,713 --> 00:23:17,894
[SPEAKER_27]: Except he's on another server.

248
00:23:17,934 --> 00:23:19,876
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, he quit the game too, anyway, so it doesn't really matter.

249
00:23:20,637 --> 00:23:20,777
[SPEAKER_27]: So...

250
00:23:21,958 --> 00:23:33,375
[SPEAKER_27]: It's just one of those things where it's like, I've been playing it since October of 2003, I'm sick of logging on to the game every day just to farm because the economy is all fucked up because they won't do anything about the gill sellers.

251
00:23:33,876 --> 00:23:34,257
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm done.

252
00:23:34,377 --> 00:23:35,779
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm not having fun with the game anymore.

253
00:23:35,839 --> 00:23:36,700
[SPEAKER_27]: It's just, I'm sorry.

254
00:23:38,377 --> 00:23:40,018
[SPEAKER_27]: Is Final Fantasy XI a bad game?

255
00:23:40,118 --> 00:23:46,021
[SPEAKER_27]: No, it's one of the best MMOs I've ever played, but it's unfortunately just kind of starting to go down the tubes in my eyes.

256
00:23:46,722 --> 00:23:48,222
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm just not interested in it anymore.

257
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:50,864
[SPEAKER_27]: There's probably things on there that still interest other people.

258
00:23:52,225 --> 00:23:53,105
[SPEAKER_27]: I, for one, am done.

259
00:23:54,206 --> 00:23:56,467
[SPEAKER_27]: I met some great people on Final Fantasy XI, though.

260
00:23:57,227 --> 00:23:57,647
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that the door?

261
00:23:57,667 --> 00:23:58,668
[SPEAKER_13]: Can you check?

262
00:23:59,844 --> 00:24:07,310
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, I just didn't have... And I don't like that you're pretty much forced to play with other people, because that pisses me the fuck off.

263
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:10,692
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, who would want to interact with other people in an online game?

264
00:24:10,772 --> 00:24:11,313
[SPEAKER_26]: In an MMO.

265
00:24:12,334 --> 00:24:22,501
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, no, the thing I liked about Ragnarok and PSO is that I could solo all I wanted to, and if I wanted to interact with other people, I could.

266
00:24:22,882 --> 00:24:25,884
[SPEAKER_21]: Final Fantasy XI forces you to interact with other people.

267
00:24:27,984 --> 00:24:29,604
[SPEAKER_21]: How was your week?

268
00:24:29,645 --> 00:24:30,945
[SPEAKER_21]: How was your day, Dark Sakura?

269
00:24:53,426 --> 00:25:02,638
[SPEAKER_21]: I changed my entire function at work, so I'm having to remember shit from three years ago that has changed since then.

270
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:08,441
[SPEAKER_21]: and it's just a big freaking pain in the ass.

271
00:25:09,621 --> 00:25:11,382
[SPEAKER_21]: On top of that, I'm still without my car.

272
00:25:11,502 --> 00:25:18,684
[SPEAKER_21]: Dan tried to hammer my fender back into shape and tore off my tire cover to try to get it to work or drive it.

273
00:25:18,724 --> 00:25:23,545
[SPEAKER_21]: Now my alignment is off to where when my wheel is straight, I turn rather sharply to the left.

274
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:24,705
[SPEAKER_26]: You have a donut car.

275
00:25:24,766 --> 00:25:25,446
[SPEAKER_26]: That's awesome.

276
00:25:26,666 --> 00:25:27,646
[SPEAKER_26]: A car that does donuts.

277
00:25:28,346 --> 00:25:28,827
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, yeah.

278
00:25:29,627 --> 00:25:33,808
[SPEAKER_21]: So my car is no longer considered safe to drive and I may be buying a new car, which is kind of cool.

279
00:25:34,426 --> 00:25:35,567
[SPEAKER_27]: E3 last week in Disneyland in my sunburn

280
00:25:55,598 --> 00:25:56,058
[SPEAKER_27]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

281
00:26:24,998 --> 00:26:29,279
[SPEAKER_27]: That's also one name away from Adam West, which makes it top of cool.

282
00:26:29,459 --> 00:26:31,159
[SPEAKER_21]: And his name is also a delicious dish.

283
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:32,479
[SPEAKER_27]: Sorry, you're weak.

284
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:37,920
[SPEAKER_21]: Another notable thing that happened this week is the release of Demon Days.

285
00:26:39,361 --> 00:26:39,961
[SPEAKER_21]: Gorillas.

286
00:26:41,921 --> 00:26:46,082
[SPEAKER_21]: Which made me very happy because I have the UK and the US version now, which is the same damn thing.

287
00:26:46,862 --> 00:26:52,063
[SPEAKER_21]: And of course, I was a big dumbass and didn't cancel one of my things at the time, so I have them both.

288
00:26:52,083 --> 00:26:53,003
[SPEAKER_21]: It's like a Game Boy.

289
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:55,710
[SPEAKER_21]: I guess.

290
00:26:56,271 --> 00:26:56,791
[SPEAKER_27]: Totally.

291
00:26:56,871 --> 00:26:59,313
[SPEAKER_27]: It's like her buying Demon Days is like a Game Boy.

292
00:26:59,333 --> 00:27:02,355
[SPEAKER_27]: It's like she got the same damn thing but just like different shrink wrap colors.

293
00:27:02,375 --> 00:27:03,136
[SPEAKER_27]: She pulled a Game Boy.

294
00:27:03,916 --> 00:27:15,245
[SPEAKER_21]: They're actually exactly the same so the way that I have to tell the difference apart on them is because they have big fold over covers you know in each direction so you can have one of their faces on the front so one of them has Murdoch and the other one has 2D.

295
00:27:17,386 --> 00:27:18,627
[SPEAKER_21]: I've been squealy fangirl.

296
00:27:19,048 --> 00:27:22,390
[SPEAKER_21]: And my Japanese EP arrived for Feel Good Inc.

297
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:24,712
[SPEAKER_21]: and it has a bunch of songs on it so I'm very happy.

298
00:27:25,623 --> 00:27:32,306
[SPEAKER_21]: I watched a ton of movies this week, none of which were any good.

299
00:27:32,346 --> 00:27:40,429
[SPEAKER_26]: I started it off with watching the original Star Wars trilogy because I have to get rid of the five movies out of the way.

300
00:27:52,301 --> 00:27:59,012
[SPEAKER_26]: Before Nelly will go see the third movie, and I want to see the third movie, but I'm not like, ooh, I have to go see it right away.

301
00:28:00,151 --> 00:28:01,832
[SPEAKER_26]: So I watched the original Star Wars trilogy.

302
00:28:01,872 --> 00:28:03,592
[SPEAKER_21]: Do you have the crap version or the good version?

303
00:28:04,072 --> 00:28:08,433
[SPEAKER_26]: I have the redone version, so... Okay, which redone version do you have?

304
00:28:08,493 --> 00:28:11,254
[SPEAKER_21]: The THX remastered or the ones with all the crap added into it?

305
00:28:11,374 --> 00:28:11,934
[SPEAKER_26]: All the crap.

306
00:28:12,675 --> 00:28:13,375
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm very sorry.

307
00:28:13,415 --> 00:28:14,595
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll copy my laser discs for you.

308
00:28:14,655 --> 00:28:15,315
[SPEAKER_26]: No, I don't want them.

309
00:28:15,616 --> 00:28:15,996
[SPEAKER_26]: Trust me.

310
00:28:16,656 --> 00:28:17,096
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't want them.

311
00:28:17,676 --> 00:28:18,336
[SPEAKER_26]: You have the crap.

312
00:28:18,576 --> 00:28:19,077
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't care.

313
00:28:19,097 --> 00:28:26,619
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't really care because no amount of crap added or subtracted from the last, you know, episode six, man.

314
00:28:27,851 --> 00:28:29,532
[SPEAKER_26]: What were they thinking, Ewoks?

315
00:28:29,652 --> 00:28:31,633
[SPEAKER_26]: Come on, that was the most retarded thing.

316
00:28:31,994 --> 00:28:36,076
[SPEAKER_26]: It was little Asian teddy bears that were attacking everything.

317
00:28:36,136 --> 00:28:37,477
[SPEAKER_26]: It was like a goddamn nightmare.

318
00:28:37,497 --> 00:28:38,657
[SPEAKER_26]: Jedi was my favorite of them.

319
00:28:38,777 --> 00:28:39,818
[SPEAKER_27]: It should have been Domo-kun.

320
00:28:41,079 --> 00:28:42,440
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh my god, that would have been actually cool.

321
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,541
[SPEAKER_27]: Let me put my Star Wars fandom into perspective for you all, okay?

322
00:28:45,922 --> 00:28:54,807
[SPEAKER_27]: I got invited to a Star Wars marathon last night where they were going to watch the original trilogy in the original, I don't know, the good form or whatever you guys call it, back-to-back-to-back.

323
00:28:55,547 --> 00:29:04,799
[SPEAKER_27]: and you know, it was going to be fun and there's going to be, you know, food and stuff and it was with some of my really, really good friends and I said, no, I don't want to fucking watch Star Wars again.

324
00:29:06,221 --> 00:29:08,103
[SPEAKER_27]: That is my Star Wars fandom, ladies and gentlemen.

325
00:29:08,164 --> 00:29:13,871
[SPEAKER_21]: I actually really do want to go put in my laser just so I can get the bad taste of episodes one and two out of my mouth.

326
00:29:14,226 --> 00:29:24,794
[SPEAKER_26]: Let me just put it this way, I mean, it was, first off, Yoda was really strange looking as a puppet, and that was the best part, because it was just like, it was like the Muppets, that's what it reminded me of, the Muppets.

327
00:29:25,454 --> 00:29:30,858
[SPEAKER_26]: And the whole Ewok thing was just retarded, it's just, I was like, why the hell did he do this?

328
00:29:31,358 --> 00:29:34,080
[SPEAKER_26]: I just wanted, I just kept making fun of the movie the entire time.

329
00:29:34,641 --> 00:29:36,302
[SPEAKER_26]: And then, um, so anyways, watch that.

330
00:29:36,322 --> 00:29:38,764
[SPEAKER_26]: Then today, for some reason, I watched, um...

331
00:29:39,504 --> 00:29:40,164
[SPEAKER_26]: Running Man.

332
00:29:40,685 --> 00:29:46,887
[SPEAKER_26]: And the best part about that, and I didn't even realize it, is Richard Dawson is the goddamn host of Running Man.

333
00:29:47,087 --> 00:29:49,968
[SPEAKER_26]: You realize the average age of our listeners is like 15, 16.

334
00:29:50,369 --> 00:29:58,772
[SPEAKER_26]: Richard Dawson was the guy that used to be part of Match Game, and he was also part of the Family Feud back in the day.

335
00:29:58,832 --> 00:29:59,993
[SPEAKER_26]: He was actually a good host.

336
00:30:00,393 --> 00:30:01,113
[SPEAKER_26]: He's pretty funny.

337
00:30:01,673 --> 00:30:04,114
[SPEAKER_26]: But I just didn't realize, I'm like, dude, that's Richard Dawson.

338
00:30:04,134 --> 00:30:04,695
[SPEAKER_26]: That's awesome.

339
00:30:05,475 --> 00:30:08,176
[SPEAKER_26]: And then, for some reason, I watched Wild Wild West, or at least

340
00:30:08,476 --> 00:30:08,977
[SPEAKER_26]: Wild Wild West

341
00:30:19,475 --> 00:30:21,418
[SPEAKER_26]: That old one with Will Smith from a few years ago?

342
00:30:21,478 --> 00:30:23,180
[SPEAKER_26]: It's fucking racist as hell.

343
00:30:24,001 --> 00:30:38,659
[SPEAKER_26]: Like, they're just making, like, you know, the one guy calls him a coon, the other guy... Basically, the one villain doesn't have legs anymore, got his legs cut off or something, so Will Smith makes fun of him for being, you know, cripple, and then, you know, the other guy makes fun of him for being, you know...

344
00:30:39,579 --> 00:30:40,280
[SPEAKER_26]: Black Person.

345
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,921
[SPEAKER_26]: And so, that was really interesting.

346
00:30:43,201 --> 00:30:43,962
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh yeah, that's so nice.

347
00:30:44,242 --> 00:31:00,932
[SPEAKER_26]: Anyway, so besides all the movies, actually the week was okay, I've been just doing more work stuff, you know, game accounts and whatnot, and then I was playing Final Fantasy XI, I'm level 58 now, my Black Mage, and that's awesome.

348
00:31:02,803 --> 00:31:07,848
[SPEAKER_26]: And that's pretty much it as far as gaming and stuff goes.

349
00:31:07,889 --> 00:31:15,056
[SPEAKER_26]: I was so bored today at Nelly's parents' house because they had their family over that is actually playing cell phone game Worms.

350
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:20,942
[SPEAKER_26]: And for some reason, the AI always commits suicide, and I don't know why.

351
00:31:22,023 --> 00:31:22,343
[SPEAKER_26]: That's all.

352
00:31:24,321 --> 00:31:24,641
[SPEAKER_26]: All right.

353
00:31:25,721 --> 00:31:26,582
[SPEAKER_26]: Bradley, how was your week?

354
00:31:26,602 --> 00:31:26,942
[SPEAKER_26]: How was your day?

355
00:31:27,142 --> 00:31:32,624
[SPEAKER_21]: Actually, before I forget, I was at Dimple, by the way, and I found another Guitar Wolf something or the other, but I forgot what it was.

356
00:31:34,524 --> 00:31:34,965
[SPEAKER_26]: That's okay.

357
00:31:37,485 --> 00:31:38,486
[SPEAKER_27]: Bradley, how was your week?

358
00:31:38,506 --> 00:31:38,926
[SPEAKER_27]: How was your day?

359
00:31:40,146 --> 00:31:41,187
[SPEAKER_24]: Our week was all right.

360
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:43,367
[SPEAKER_24]: Work went pretty fast this week.

361
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:45,948
[SPEAKER_24]: Sometimes it's like really slow.

362
00:31:46,629 --> 00:31:48,749
[SPEAKER_24]: This week actually felt like it went pretty fast.

363
00:31:48,809 --> 00:31:53,831
[SPEAKER_24]: And then, yay, this weekend is the first full three-day weekend I get for the year.

364
00:31:55,765 --> 00:31:56,205
[SPEAKER_24]: This is good.

365
00:31:56,846 --> 00:32:00,429
[SPEAKER_24]: And then today, I was playing on here, and it stopped.

366
00:32:00,549 --> 00:32:01,029
[SPEAKER_24]: It went off.

367
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:11,919
[SPEAKER_24]: That was because the power supply fan had been batty for the past year or so, and then it finally decided to stop, and then it burned itself out.

368
00:32:12,719 --> 00:32:15,582
[SPEAKER_24]: So I had to go to Fry's and pick up a new one and put that in.

369
00:32:15,742 --> 00:32:22,367
[SPEAKER_24]: And then when I restarted it, the network card driver died.

370
00:32:24,807 --> 00:32:25,367
[SPEAKER_24]: for some reason.

371
00:32:25,587 --> 00:32:30,730
[SPEAKER_24]: So it wanted me to reinstall, but my floppy disk drive doesn't work anymore.

372
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:32,731
[SPEAKER_24]: It's been dead for two or three years.

373
00:32:33,832 --> 00:32:39,595
[SPEAKER_24]: So I came over here so you can see if they would probably burn me a disk or something.

374
00:32:40,716 --> 00:32:41,576
[SPEAKER_24]: And that'll happen.

375
00:32:42,717 --> 00:32:43,577
[SPEAKER_24]: And that's about all.

376
00:32:44,078 --> 00:32:47,920
[SPEAKER_24]: I played Devil May Cry because I've only played a little bit of that.

377
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:52,022
[SPEAKER_24]: That's one of the games I got when I bought the PS2 from Jamie's friend.

378
00:32:53,022 --> 00:32:53,802
[SPEAKER_24]: I hardly ever played it.

379
00:32:53,822 --> 00:32:56,123
[SPEAKER_24]: I only played the first level until now.

380
00:32:58,304 --> 00:32:58,604
[SPEAKER_24]: That's it.

381
00:32:59,084 --> 00:32:59,424
[SPEAKER_27]: Alrighty.

382
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:00,765
[SPEAKER_27]: My week and my day.

383
00:33:01,245 --> 00:33:08,107
[SPEAKER_27]: I went TV shopping yesterday because you know how sometimes when you have extra money it's like, oh damn, I got money to burn right now.

384
00:33:08,147 --> 00:33:08,907
[SPEAKER_27]: I gotta buy something.

385
00:33:08,967 --> 00:33:17,710
[SPEAKER_27]: So I had this urge to go out and buy a new TV because my credit card is at a zero balance right now so I'm like, I can afford to buy something nice for myself.

386
00:33:18,031 --> 00:33:19,031
[SPEAKER_27]: So I went to go look at TVs.

387
00:33:19,611 --> 00:33:21,992
[SPEAKER_27]: I really couldn't find anything

388
00:33:22,984 --> 00:33:23,244
[SPEAKER_27]: Http://bit.ly

389
00:33:38,383 --> 00:33:49,327
[SPEAKER_27]: Like, they have, like, somewhat reasonable HDTVs for, like, I don't know, $600 or something, but it seemed like one of those kinds that would break after a year, and I don't want to buy a TV if it's just going to break after a year.

390
00:33:49,767 --> 00:33:56,070
[SPEAKER_27]: And then the problem is, and I think this is why people are afraid to go up to HDTV, there's too damn many types of TVs.

391
00:33:56,350 --> 00:34:01,992
[SPEAKER_27]: There's the widescreen, and there's the plasma, and there's the projection, and the LCD, and then there's 4x3s.

392
00:34:03,292 --> 00:34:07,433
[SPEAKER_27]: It is too overwhelming, and I consider myself somewhat technically inclined.

393
00:34:07,493 --> 00:34:14,075
[SPEAKER_27]: I mean, I know how to, you know, do a radio show on the internet with friends, you know, but I can't figure out what TV I want.

394
00:34:15,216 --> 00:34:16,716
[SPEAKER_27]: Is that freaking sad, or what?

395
00:34:18,017 --> 00:34:20,217
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, stop watching TV, just download it all on your computer.

396
00:34:20,697 --> 00:34:23,558
[SPEAKER_27]: But see, this is the thing, I'm not buying a TV for TV.

397
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:26,639
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm buying a TV for my DVDs and games.

398
00:34:27,479 --> 00:34:29,120
[SPEAKER_21]: Laser pointer for iPod?

399
00:34:30,248 --> 00:34:32,049
[SPEAKER_27]: No, I'm not getting a laser pointer for my iPhone.

400
00:34:32,609 --> 00:34:35,050
[SPEAKER_21]: No, I'm sorry, this just... Anyway.

401
00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:40,511
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, we actually are going to be buying a... We want to get a widescreen TV.

402
00:34:41,252 --> 00:34:42,392
[SPEAKER_21]: You know what all I'm going to use it for?

403
00:34:42,412 --> 00:34:43,932
[SPEAKER_27]: Video games.

404
00:34:44,513 --> 00:34:44,773
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

405
00:34:46,013 --> 00:34:48,594
[SPEAKER_21]: And Dan's all like, I can watch this movie, I can watch this movie.

406
00:34:49,254 --> 00:34:51,375
[SPEAKER_21]: We haven't discussed a single TV show.

407
00:34:51,855 --> 00:34:53,735
[SPEAKER_21]: All he watches is that 70s show.

408
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:58,497
[SPEAKER_21]: And all I watch is basically all day watching him play Fire Emblem.

409
00:35:03,098 --> 00:35:03,698
[SPEAKER_27]: Here's the thing.

410
00:35:05,058 --> 00:35:09,479
[SPEAKER_27]: Sure, I could tell by walking in there which one of those TVs was the prettiest TV.

411
00:35:09,539 --> 00:35:16,421
[SPEAKER_27]: Of course, that huge 52-inch widescreen LCD plasma super-duper HDTV was obviously the best one.

412
00:35:16,941 --> 00:35:25,683
[SPEAKER_27]: But let's face it, boys and girls, I'm doing a radio show on the Internet, not on New York over-the-air radio.

413
00:35:25,723 --> 00:35:29,484
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't quite have a lot of money to spend on nice TVs.

414
00:35:30,584 --> 00:35:47,143
[SPEAKER_27]: so I have to find something that's in the middle somewhere where it's a nice TV but affordable and I think just right now is a bad time for TVs because I think they're going to come down in price by the end of the year at least that's what I hope is that there'll be a price war this Christmas and they'll come down I even saw a story on Yahoo the other day it said they were going to come down in price soon enough so

415
00:35:49,165 --> 00:36:00,249
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright, anyway, so instead of getting the TV, I ended up buying a DVD kit for my Xbox because it's just a long story about the setup of our house, but I needed one, trust me.

416
00:36:01,090 --> 00:36:07,012
[SPEAKER_27]: And F Microsoft for having to, you have to buy a DVD kit to turn your Xbox into a DVD player, that sucks.

417
00:36:07,392 --> 00:36:10,954
[SPEAKER_27]: But I must admit it is a very nice DVD player because you can do Zoom and all that stuff, so it's cool.

418
00:36:11,814 --> 00:36:13,855
[SPEAKER_27]: I also picked up Fable for the Xbox.

419
00:36:14,824 --> 00:36:15,445
[SPEAKER_27]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

420
00:36:34,975 --> 00:36:36,517
[SPEAKER_27]: That was pretty much my week and my day.

421
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:41,666
[SPEAKER_27]: Going back to work this week was good because I got to get back into the swing of things.

422
00:36:42,106 --> 00:36:47,836
[SPEAKER_27]: It was kind of refreshing, believe it or not, to go back to work after being in LA for a week and stay out of place and everything.

423
00:36:47,876 --> 00:36:48,277
[SPEAKER_27]: So it was nice.

424
00:36:50,655 --> 00:36:54,279
[SPEAKER_27]: Let's move on to some Bomani-related things.

425
00:36:54,779 --> 00:36:59,544
[SPEAKER_27]: We are going to do a premiere of a brand new DDR Ultramix 3 song.

426
00:36:59,925 --> 00:37:04,730
[SPEAKER_27]: Funny enough, go figure, this is a song that originally showed up in our cage match.

427
00:37:05,811 --> 00:37:08,154
[SPEAKER_27]: And if you might remember DDR Ultramix 2...

428
00:37:09,375 --> 00:37:09,455
[SPEAKER_27]: D.D.R.

429
00:37:30,911 --> 00:37:33,952
[SPEAKER_27]: So, maybe our cage matches were something after all.

430
00:37:34,012 --> 00:37:36,493
[SPEAKER_27]: So tune in tonight because there might be a new DDR song in it.

431
00:37:36,913 --> 00:37:39,574
[SPEAKER_27]: Anyway, here's this new song that's announced for DDR Ultramix 3.

432
00:37:40,074 --> 00:37:41,815
[SPEAKER_27]: It was not in the E3 demo.

433
00:37:43,095 --> 00:37:48,477
[SPEAKER_27]: It was actually announced by the artist himself on his website, our old buddy Middyhead, who we interviewed a little while ago.

434
00:37:48,497 --> 00:37:49,678
[SPEAKER_27]: We've got to get him back on the show.

435
00:37:50,018 --> 00:37:53,039
[SPEAKER_27]: Because he's got not only this, but he's got the Jelly Kiss remix.

436
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:57,720
[SPEAKER_27]: And he said on his site that there is something else as well.

437
00:37:57,820 --> 00:37:59,421
[SPEAKER_27]: So, here it is.

438
00:38:00,379 --> 00:38:02,644
[SPEAKER_27]: Midi Head, a brand new song for Ultramix 3.

439
00:38:02,685 --> 00:38:04,850
[SPEAKER_27]: You're going to be dancing to this one in the fall.

440
00:38:05,932 --> 00:38:07,516
[SPEAKER_27]: Raise Your Hands is the name of this song.

441
00:38:07,576 --> 00:38:09,641
[SPEAKER_27]: And we'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.

442
00:39:45,225 --> 00:39:45,887
Thanks for watching!

443
00:40:54,742 --> 00:41:05,188
Light in the mist as a DJ assist, shouting out to the fans Raise your hands, raise your hands Raise your hands, raise your hands Raise your hands

444
00:41:41,171 --> 00:41:41,812
Thanks for watching!

445
00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:29,471
[SPEAKER_27]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

446
00:42:49,546 --> 00:42:55,630
[SPEAKER_27]: Um, that will be edited down a little bit, and I think that's going to be a pretty kick-butt song when it's edited down.

447
00:42:55,890 --> 00:42:58,512
[SPEAKER_27]: I love the beat in that song, so it's going to be neat, I think.

448
00:42:59,092 --> 00:43:03,335
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, if they edit out the singing.

449
00:43:06,217 --> 00:43:07,497
[SPEAKER_27]: Burn all our bridges, alright.

450
00:43:09,619 --> 00:43:12,641
[SPEAKER_21]: Um... It was really good, honestly it was.

451
00:43:12,901 --> 00:43:13,101
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah.

452
00:43:13,942 --> 00:43:15,202
[SPEAKER_21]: And it does sound better than Politary.

453
00:43:15,783 --> 00:43:16,003
[SPEAKER_27]: Mm-hmm.

454
00:43:16,567 --> 00:43:17,428
[SPEAKER_21]: So that's something.

455
00:43:17,889 --> 00:43:18,029
[SPEAKER_27]: Yep.

456
00:43:18,690 --> 00:43:19,010
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright.

457
00:43:19,651 --> 00:43:21,313
[SPEAKER_27]: So I wanted to play that for you guys out there.

458
00:43:22,515 --> 00:43:25,960
[SPEAKER_27]: Orange Lounge Radio giving you new Bomani music as soon as we can dig it up.

459
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:30,102
[SPEAKER_27]: Play a new song from the new song pack from Xbox.

460
00:43:30,142 --> 00:43:31,603
[SPEAKER_27]: Actually, I think it's two song packs to go.

461
00:43:31,623 --> 00:43:32,464
[SPEAKER_27]: We're a little late on it.

462
00:43:32,804 --> 00:43:42,651
[SPEAKER_27]: But let's face it, boys and girls, at least me was in the middle of the move with the new studio and everything, so I didn't have a chance to get on Xbox Live previously and check out the song pack.

463
00:43:43,051 --> 00:43:45,833
[SPEAKER_27]: Although I have to say, after downloading it, I kind of dig it.

464
00:43:46,033 --> 00:43:47,394
[SPEAKER_27]: I like the new song packs.

465
00:43:47,754 --> 00:43:49,195
[SPEAKER_27]: So, good stuff.

466
00:43:49,476 --> 00:43:49,876
[SPEAKER_27]: Good stuff.

467
00:43:50,751 --> 00:43:54,494
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright, let's move on to something else going on in the Millennium community right now.

468
00:43:54,534 --> 00:43:55,755
[SPEAKER_27]: Kind of a big story this week.

469
00:43:56,435 --> 00:44:03,801
[SPEAKER_27]: A lot of exposure happening for the new games, thanks to E3, for the new DDR.

470
00:44:03,821 --> 00:44:06,103
[SPEAKER_27]: And of course, Beatmania is even getting out there.

471
00:44:06,423 --> 00:44:10,846
[SPEAKER_27]: Some people are kind of questioning, is this Beatmania thing going to catch on here in the US?

472
00:44:10,906 --> 00:44:13,428
[SPEAKER_27]: It was a big risk in a way Konami was taking.

473
00:44:14,409 --> 00:44:19,493
[SPEAKER_27]: Jason Ian has been trying to get Beatmania over here for a long, long time, and it took this long, finally.

474
00:44:20,133 --> 00:44:20,734
[SPEAKER_27]: Let's come out here.

475
00:44:22,835 --> 00:44:26,837
[SPEAKER_27]: In fact, Game Informer, isn't that Game Stomps Magazine?

476
00:44:26,877 --> 00:44:36,003
[SPEAKER_27]: Game Informer Online put Beatmania number 9 on its top 10 list of E3 showstoppers.

477
00:44:36,343 --> 00:44:44,488
[SPEAKER_27]: That's not bad when you consider you've got, oh, I don't know, three new consoles and new technologies and the new Zelda and everything else to compete with.

478
00:44:44,808 --> 00:44:47,810
[SPEAKER_27]: That's really a pretty good showing for a little game from Japan.

479
00:44:49,707 --> 00:44:54,251
[SPEAKER_27]: CNN, talking about Karaoke Revolution Party, as well as MSNBC.

480
00:44:55,232 --> 00:45:14,108
[SPEAKER_27]: Very interesting that Karaoke Revolution Party seems to get a lot of the attention, but, you know, I think for those of us not in the hardcore, I can kind of see where Karaoke Revolution is more of an accessible game, because everybody can at least try to sing, but not everybody can really dance.

481
00:45:15,982 --> 00:45:18,723
[SPEAKER_27]: Some people just can't dance, but everybody can try and sing.

482
00:45:20,223 --> 00:45:21,304
[SPEAKER_27]: It's a game you play with your voice.

483
00:45:24,485 --> 00:45:32,027
[SPEAKER_27]: So, because of all this exposure, Konami, for whatever reason, decided to put this poll on their site.

484
00:45:33,367 --> 00:45:39,569
[SPEAKER_27]: And so they're actually asking on their site, which upcoming music game are you most looking forward to?

485
00:45:40,563 --> 00:45:45,727
[SPEAKER_27]: Karaoke Revolution Party, Beatmania, DDR Extreme 2, or DDR Ultramix 3?

486
00:45:47,188 --> 00:45:49,210
[SPEAKER_27]: Which one of these four do you guys think would be in the lead?

487
00:45:52,132 --> 00:45:57,577
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, I already know the answer to this, but... Well, then let me ask DarkSakura, which one of these three do you think would be in the lead?

488
00:45:57,717 --> 00:45:58,297
[SPEAKER_27]: The list?

489
00:45:58,758 --> 00:46:03,401
[SPEAKER_27]: Karaoke Revolution Party, Beatmania, DDR Extreme 2, or DDR Ultramix 3?

490
00:46:04,082 --> 00:46:06,344
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, personally, I put Beatmania at the top of the list.

491
00:46:08,177 --> 00:46:13,159
[SPEAKER_27]: Beatmania is currently in third place with 4% of the vote.

492
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:18,300
[SPEAKER_27]: Here's what happened, boys and girls.

493
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:22,962
[SPEAKER_27]: There was a pretty legit thing going on where all the results were really somewhat neck and neck.

494
00:46:23,262 --> 00:46:25,843
[SPEAKER_27]: Beatmania and DDR Extreme 2 leading for a little bit.

495
00:46:26,603 --> 00:46:27,023
[SPEAKER_27]: And then...

496
00:46:28,186 --> 00:46:38,370
[SPEAKER_27]: Somebody decided to launch a script because currently DDR Ultramix 3 has 73% of the vote with 83,096 votes.

497
00:46:40,110 --> 00:46:44,592
[SPEAKER_27]: I think that's more people than are registered on DDR Freak, if I'm not mistaking.

498
00:46:44,712 --> 00:46:45,552
[SPEAKER_27]: Do you believe you're right?

499
00:46:46,593 --> 00:46:48,793
[SPEAKER_27]: So somehow this puzzles me.

500
00:46:51,074 --> 00:46:53,435
[SPEAKER_27]: The 83,000 people voted for Ultramix 3.

501
00:46:53,675 --> 00:46:54,155
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, right.

502
00:46:54,535 --> 00:46:54,935
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, right.

503
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:56,336
[SPEAKER_27]: Somebody out there is running a script.

504
00:46:58,143 --> 00:47:05,105
[SPEAKER_27]: Why would somebody feel the need to run a script to put false votes in this poll?

505
00:47:06,045 --> 00:47:07,666
[SPEAKER_27]: For Ultramix 3, nonetheless?

506
00:47:08,266 --> 00:47:20,529
[SPEAKER_27]: I mean, don't get me wrong, I think the DDR Ultramix games are some of the best things that have happened to us forever, but we all knew, going into E3, we all knew that it was inevitable we would get an Ultramix 3 and an Extreme 2.

507
00:47:20,709 --> 00:47:24,490
[SPEAKER_27]: What we didn't know, we didn't know we were getting Beatmania here in the U.S.,

508
00:47:25,202 --> 00:47:29,306
[SPEAKER_21]: For the record, 53,163 members of DDR Freak.

509
00:47:29,547 --> 00:47:29,887
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

510
00:47:30,248 --> 00:47:35,954
[SPEAKER_27]: So over 30,000 more people than are registered on DDR Freak placed to vote for Ultramix 3.

511
00:47:36,755 --> 00:47:37,015
[SPEAKER_27]: Right.

512
00:47:37,295 --> 00:47:37,716
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, right.

513
00:47:37,956 --> 00:47:38,356
[SPEAKER_27]: Let me see.

514
00:47:38,456 --> 00:47:40,639
[SPEAKER_27]: I bet if I reloaded this frame right now...

515
00:47:44,758 --> 00:47:45,218
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, never mind.

516
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:46,739
[SPEAKER_27]: They did stop running this script.

517
00:47:46,779 --> 00:47:47,760
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, I don't see it anymore.

518
00:47:48,301 --> 00:47:59,529
[SPEAKER_27]: But for a while, some of the message boards were saying, dude, every time you click reload on the poll results, you can see that Ultramix 3 jumps up by like five or six votes each time.

519
00:47:59,809 --> 00:48:01,350
[SPEAKER_27]: So obviously somebody was running a script.

520
00:48:04,491 --> 00:48:06,032
[SPEAKER_27]: But why did you feel the need to run a script?

521
00:48:06,072 --> 00:48:11,236
[SPEAKER_27]: We did not know that Beatmania was going to be coming before E3, so this is something we should be backing.

522
00:48:11,536 --> 00:48:13,977
[SPEAKER_27]: Same thing with Karaoke Revolution Party, in a way.

523
00:48:14,097 --> 00:48:24,384
[SPEAKER_27]: I know it's kind of the stepchild of the Bomani series, for those of us that are core, you know, been into the games for a long time, but that sing and dance thing, we weren't expecting that, really.

524
00:48:24,444 --> 00:48:25,325
[SPEAKER_27]: At least I wasn't.

525
00:48:26,806 --> 00:48:32,570
[SPEAKER_27]: I was just expecting Karaoke Revolution Volume 4 with just, you know, more songs, same old shit, different game, right?

526
00:48:34,008 --> 00:48:38,126
[SPEAKER_27]: but now we get karaoke revolution party which is you know being a little bit innovative so that's kinda neat

527
00:48:40,236 --> 00:48:42,277
[SPEAKER_27]: But somebody felt the need out there to run a script.

528
00:48:42,317 --> 00:48:53,440
[SPEAKER_27]: By the way, somebody out there apparently decided that they're sad that Karaoke Revolution is falling behind because they're running a script for Karaoke Revolution Party voting as well, which is up to now 20% of the vote.

529
00:48:53,980 --> 00:48:54,840
[SPEAKER_27]: 23,724 votes.

530
00:48:55,020 --> 00:49:05,283
[SPEAKER_27]: I somehow doubt that's legit, especially when you consider that DDR Extreme 2, which probably sells better the series Extreme than any of these games, DDR Extreme 2, 2,129 votes.

531
00:49:05,303 --> 00:49:06,143
[SPEAKER_27]: 1% of the vote.

532
00:49:10,629 --> 00:49:11,651
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, right.

533
00:49:13,575 --> 00:49:17,443
[SPEAKER_27]: So do you think a Konami rep is going to look at this and go, yeah, this makes sense.

534
00:49:18,424 --> 00:49:21,826
[SPEAKER_27]: Do you think a Konami rep even gives a shit about this poll, honestly?

535
00:49:22,247 --> 00:49:27,150
[SPEAKER_27]: This is the part that surprised me, is that it was like the news on like half the Bomani sites out there.

536
00:49:27,170 --> 00:49:31,854
[SPEAKER_27]: Not that I blame them, because it is kind of cool that Konami's putting it on their front page.

537
00:49:32,234 --> 00:49:34,456
[SPEAKER_27]: But I think people read into it way too much.

538
00:49:34,516 --> 00:49:42,622
[SPEAKER_27]: I think people assume that, oh my gosh, because Konami put this on their front page poll, this is gonna make or break the future of Bomani Games.

539
00:49:43,002 --> 00:49:43,082
[SPEAKER_27]: No.

540
00:49:44,207 --> 00:49:45,948
[SPEAKER_27]: All these games were shown at E3.

541
00:49:46,329 --> 00:49:53,314
[SPEAKER_27]: All these games had press releases and release dates, even though some of them weren't so specific, release dates were attached to them.

542
00:49:53,794 --> 00:49:58,938
[SPEAKER_27]: Unlike some games shown at E3, Duke Nukem Forever, these games will come out eventually.

543
00:49:59,478 --> 00:50:01,539
[SPEAKER_27]: You had Duke Nukem Forever at E3 this year?

544
00:50:01,579 --> 00:50:02,580
[SPEAKER_27]: Years ago, they did.

545
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:05,602
[SPEAKER_27]: I was going to say, wow, they actually had it shown?

546
00:50:06,043 --> 00:50:11,967
[SPEAKER_27]: You don't have to vote for this game over and over and over again for it to show up.

547
00:50:13,325 --> 00:50:16,766
[SPEAKER_27]: This poll is not going to make or break the future of the Ultramix series.

548
00:50:16,826 --> 00:50:17,746
[SPEAKER_27]: I hate to break it to you.

549
00:50:18,166 --> 00:50:21,247
[SPEAKER_27]: This poll is not going to make or break the Beatmania series.

550
00:50:21,987 --> 00:50:26,568
[SPEAKER_27]: So take a little rest in that, those of you guys that are pissed off that Beatmania has only got 4% of the vote.

551
00:50:26,808 --> 00:50:27,428
[SPEAKER_27]: Nobody cares.

552
00:50:28,108 --> 00:50:29,469
[SPEAKER_27]: You want to know what Konami cares about?

553
00:50:29,929 --> 00:50:32,989
[SPEAKER_27]: When the game comes out, they want people to buy it.

554
00:50:34,190 --> 00:50:35,710
[SPEAKER_27]: And you can't run a script for that.

555
00:50:36,997 --> 00:50:40,439
[SPEAKER_27]: So if you truly support the games, I hope you're going to buy them when they come out.

556
00:50:40,819 --> 00:50:44,441
[SPEAKER_27]: Because if not enough people buy Beatmania when it comes out, you know what they're going to say?

557
00:50:45,181 --> 00:50:48,303
[SPEAKER_27]: They're going to say the same thing they said with Guitar Freaks in Japan.

558
00:50:49,003 --> 00:50:49,384
[SPEAKER_27]: Fuck it.

559
00:50:51,145 --> 00:50:51,905
[SPEAKER_27]: Your thoughts on this.

560
00:50:51,985 --> 00:50:52,265
[SPEAKER_27]: Loki.

561
00:50:53,366 --> 00:50:54,907
[SPEAKER_26]: This is just an opinion poll.

562
00:50:54,947 --> 00:50:55,747
[SPEAKER_26]: Who gives a crap?

563
00:50:56,708 --> 00:50:57,308
[SPEAKER_26]: It doesn't matter.

564
00:50:57,348 --> 00:50:58,048
[SPEAKER_26]: It doesn't mean anything.

565
00:50:58,108 --> 00:51:01,330
[SPEAKER_26]: It's just... Ooh, let's see what the opinion is.

566
00:51:01,650 --> 00:51:03,191
[SPEAKER_26]: Just like on the Ear Freak polls.

567
00:51:03,251 --> 00:51:03,811
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, come on.

568
00:51:03,831 --> 00:51:04,792
[SPEAKER_26]: Those don't mean anything.

569
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:06,501
[SPEAKER_26]: It's the same damn thing.

570
00:51:06,541 --> 00:51:16,487
[SPEAKER_27]: And we don't want to belittle, and the polls on our website, they don't mean anything either, honestly, and I hate to belittle it, but the honest thing is, it's just something, it's a fun poll.

571
00:51:16,927 --> 00:51:21,370
[SPEAKER_27]: It's just, you know, how many of you guys in the room thought the last Star Wars movie sucked?

572
00:51:21,630 --> 00:51:24,191
[SPEAKER_27]: You know, and then, you know, you poll, and it's fun.

573
00:51:24,332 --> 00:51:24,692
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, really?

574
00:51:25,372 --> 00:51:26,473
[SPEAKER_27]: Who knew I was in the minority?

575
00:51:26,753 --> 00:51:29,695
[SPEAKER_27]: It's a teehee fun poll, all these polls on websites.

576
00:51:32,512 --> 00:51:34,853
[SPEAKER_26]: This is in the MTV Video Game Awards, folks.

577
00:51:34,993 --> 00:51:35,334
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, yeah.

578
00:51:35,554 --> 00:51:37,034
[SPEAKER_27]: You remember this years ago?

579
00:51:37,835 --> 00:51:39,596
[SPEAKER_27]: Halo and Dance Dance Revolution.

580
00:51:39,616 --> 00:51:43,798
[SPEAKER_27]: Didn't J-Dog from DDR Freak, of all people, write the script that did this?

581
00:51:46,479 --> 00:51:49,581
[SPEAKER_27]: For the... Like, remember... When was it?

582
00:51:49,641 --> 00:51:52,082
[SPEAKER_27]: It was either 2005... I want to say it was going into 2004.

583
00:51:54,326 --> 00:51:56,087
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you for watching!

584
00:52:15,212 --> 00:52:23,980
[SPEAKER_27]: and in the end, according to the website, DDR was number one and we were all, yeah, DDR is going to be number one on the top 20 countdown, yeah.

585
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:24,920
[SPEAKER_27]: Guess what?

586
00:52:25,801 --> 00:52:28,984
[SPEAKER_27]: When it was actually put out on TV, guess where DDR landed on the poll?

587
00:52:29,785 --> 00:52:32,827
[SPEAKER_27]: Last place, 20th, last place.

588
00:52:33,207 --> 00:52:35,429
[SPEAKER_27]: Your voting on the website didn't mean shit.

589
00:52:36,650 --> 00:52:39,673
[SPEAKER_27]: Now, the intentions back then were good.

590
00:52:39,953 --> 00:52:42,195
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't think that, anyway.

591
00:52:42,799 --> 00:52:43,019
[SPEAKER_27]: What?

592
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:44,180
[SPEAKER_27]: No, finish your thought.

593
00:52:44,981 --> 00:52:47,023
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, the intentions back then were different.

594
00:52:47,623 --> 00:52:51,387
[SPEAKER_27]: Because MTV, that's different.

595
00:52:51,467 --> 00:52:52,908
[SPEAKER_27]: You don't know what they're going to do.

596
00:52:52,988 --> 00:52:56,071
[SPEAKER_21]: So I understand why people... MTV is synonymous with crap anyway.

597
00:52:56,091 --> 00:52:57,152
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, yeah, I understand that.

598
00:52:57,172 --> 00:53:08,082
[SPEAKER_26]: Their whole thinking, which was just insane anyways, was like, if it gets on MTV as number one, then maybe Konami will realize, well, the fans love it, and they'll put it on Arcade Mix.

599
00:53:08,402 --> 00:53:15,027
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, Konami will realize the fans love it when stores are sold out of it and you can't find it on shelves anywhere.

600
00:53:15,448 --> 00:53:16,328
[SPEAKER_27]: That's when they'll know.

601
00:53:16,709 --> 00:53:23,814
[SPEAKER_27]: For instance, Katamari Damacy, do you think we'd ever be seeing a sequel if that game wasn't impossible to find?

602
00:53:25,075 --> 00:53:25,275
[SPEAKER_27]: No.

603
00:53:26,436 --> 00:53:28,558
[SPEAKER_27]: That game is selling like mad.

604
00:53:28,598 --> 00:53:31,160
[SPEAKER_27]: That's why there's going to be a sequel to Katamari Damacy.

605
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:39,449
[SPEAKER_27]: No MTV poll, no poll over at Namco's site or anything had to dictate that new game coming out.

606
00:53:41,432 --> 00:53:44,657
[SPEAKER_26]: Numbers, money, that's what they look at as the bottom line.

607
00:53:44,677 --> 00:53:45,779
[SPEAKER_26]: I think we've covered the poll thing enough.

608
00:53:47,766 --> 00:53:51,689
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't even want to dedicate this much effort into talking about this.

609
00:53:51,710 --> 00:53:55,953
[SPEAKER_27]: But it just irritates me that somebody, I mean, why would somebody do this?

610
00:53:55,993 --> 00:53:59,176
[SPEAKER_27]: They'd be like, hey, look at how big my internet penis is.

611
00:53:59,256 --> 00:54:01,538
[SPEAKER_27]: It takes up 73% of the screen right now.

612
00:54:01,858 --> 00:54:03,439
[SPEAKER_21]: Nobody will ever be as big as Jason's.

613
00:54:05,821 --> 00:54:06,382
[SPEAKER_27]: Recognize.

614
00:54:10,819 --> 00:54:14,740
[SPEAKER_27]: Just remember, if you think this poll is going to do any good, just watch what happened on the MTV thing.

615
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:17,761
[SPEAKER_27]: The answers are already predetermined.

616
00:54:17,781 --> 00:54:22,442
[SPEAKER_26]: So this is what's going to happen if they allow internet voting for presidents?

617
00:54:23,422 --> 00:54:23,982
[SPEAKER_26]: Absolutely.

618
00:54:24,002 --> 00:54:27,743
[SPEAKER_26]: That's why it'll never happen, at least in the next 20 years.

619
00:54:31,804 --> 00:54:32,464
[SPEAKER_27]: But who knows?

620
00:54:32,504 --> 00:54:33,684
[SPEAKER_27]: I've been proven wrong before.

621
00:54:33,704 --> 00:54:34,424
[SPEAKER_27]: We'll see what happens.

622
00:54:36,405 --> 00:54:37,385
[SPEAKER_27]: How about a break time, kids?

623
00:54:38,922 --> 00:54:39,544
[SPEAKER_27]: How about it?

624
00:54:48,069 --> 00:54:48,909
[SPEAKER_27]: At least I liked it.

625
00:54:48,969 --> 00:54:53,450
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't know what my co-hosts will think, but I'm entitled to my Wii song once in a while, I think.

626
00:54:53,830 --> 00:54:57,191
[SPEAKER_27]: So this is Vanilla Ninja with Liar is what we're going to start off this break with.

627
00:54:57,651 --> 00:55:01,852
[SPEAKER_27]: And then also in this break, we'll play other stuff, too.

628
00:55:03,512 --> 00:55:04,132
[SPEAKER_27]: Some potpourri.

629
00:55:04,412 --> 00:55:06,513
[SPEAKER_27]: And then when we come back from this break, some more Bomani news.

630
00:55:06,533 --> 00:55:12,354
[SPEAKER_27]: Tonight's cage match, of course, your calls via the Skype line, www.orangeloungeradio.com.

631
00:55:13,014 --> 00:55:16,215
[SPEAKER_27]: Click on Interact With Us, and we'll start taking some calls via Skype when we come back.

632
00:55:16,275 --> 00:55:16,775
[SPEAKER_27]: Sound good?

633
00:55:17,962 --> 00:55:18,462
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah!

634
00:55:18,482 --> 00:55:22,624
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright, we'll be back after this from Guitar Freaks, Drum Mania V, Manila Ninja, Liar.

635
00:55:49,543 --> 00:55:56,267
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm feeling about to feel in love, I'm really good at hiding on the road, you know

636
00:56:13,562 --> 00:56:17,689
If you wanna lie to me again, the rhythm of your fate is on the end Just go there, and stay there, lie down

637
00:56:31,505 --> 00:56:41,871
I'm feeling about to be in love I'm growing to the heart of all the world There's no way, there's no way If you wanna like me again Then if you want to take it all, yeah, just come with me

638
00:57:35,945 --> 00:57:37,446
Can you be a fantasy?

639
00:57:37,466 --> 00:57:39,547
Give me ecstasy Can you be a fantasy?

640
00:58:03,991 --> 00:58:04,572
Thanks for watching!

641
00:58:41,978 --> 00:58:54,967
[SPEAKER_18]: And the heat of the night, the night And the heat of the night, the night Why did our feelings die in action When we fought for satisfaction But our hearts end at the well Save me

642
00:59:11,117 --> 00:59:11,539
[SPEAKER_18]: What?

643
00:59:11,779 --> 00:59:13,386
[SPEAKER_18]: The love of magic

644
01:00:46,613 --> 01:00:47,755
Thanks for watching!

645
01:01:29,065 --> 01:01:33,067
This is the way we rock, this is the way we ride, as we demonstrate, as we demonstrate.

646
01:01:33,087 --> 01:01:35,249
From the steps wide to arms loud, this DDR sucks!

647
01:01:59,109 --> 01:01:59,470
[SPEAKER_15]: TGP-O

648
01:02:07,307 --> 01:02:12,588
[SPEAKER_27]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio and episode number 144 for you guys.

649
01:02:12,848 --> 01:02:20,270
[SPEAKER_27]: You know, it's kind of sad because it is a three-day weekend and typically on the three-day weekends we do our drunk shows, but you may notice we're not doing that tonight.

650
01:02:20,290 --> 01:02:22,690
[SPEAKER_27]: That's because Jamie and I are going clubbing after tonight's show.

651
01:02:22,770 --> 01:02:23,691
[SPEAKER_27]: We're getting our goth on.

652
01:02:23,711 --> 01:02:26,571
[SPEAKER_27]: Because we don't get to go out on Sunday nights very often, so we're going to go out tonight.

653
01:02:26,651 --> 01:02:28,412
[SPEAKER_27]: And Loki, well, I don't know what his excuse is.

654
01:02:28,492 --> 01:02:30,092
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh yeah, he drove over here so he can't really drink.

655
01:02:31,192 --> 01:02:31,972
[SPEAKER_27]: He'll go club seals.

656
01:02:32,613 --> 01:02:34,433
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, he'll go club seals instead of clubbing.

657
01:02:34,993 --> 01:02:36,193
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm going to have me some Guinness.

658
01:02:37,034 --> 01:02:39,915
[SPEAKER_27]: I totally want to drink at the club, man.

659
01:02:40,255 --> 01:02:41,015
[SPEAKER_27]: I can have one drink.

660
01:02:41,155 --> 01:02:43,295
[SPEAKER_21]: You can have one and then not drink anything for three hours.

661
01:02:43,456 --> 01:02:44,536
[SPEAKER_27]: That's pretty much what I get to do.

662
01:02:44,736 --> 01:02:45,336
[SPEAKER_21]: Drink a lot of water.

663
01:02:46,236 --> 01:02:50,838
[SPEAKER_21]: Because it takes, I think, two hours for a high metabolism to oxidize alcohol.

664
01:02:51,118 --> 01:02:53,398
[SPEAKER_27]: For a big guy like me, though, my body can handle a lot.

665
01:02:54,159 --> 01:02:54,559
[SPEAKER_27]: Lightweight.

666
01:02:54,779 --> 01:02:55,879
[SPEAKER_27]: You're lightweight and you know it.

667
01:02:55,919 --> 01:02:56,679
[SPEAKER_27]: Not anymore.

668
01:02:57,420 --> 01:02:58,020
[SPEAKER_27]: Not anymore.

669
01:02:58,380 --> 01:02:59,180
[SPEAKER_27]: Maybe in college.

670
01:03:00,621 --> 01:03:01,641
[SPEAKER_27]: Maybe before I was 21.

671
01:03:04,136 --> 01:03:04,816
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh yeah, hi kids.

672
01:03:05,236 --> 01:03:06,817
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't know, man.

673
01:03:06,957 --> 01:03:10,678
[SPEAKER_26]: I remember you falling out of the chair during all the drunk shows.

674
01:03:10,698 --> 01:03:13,099
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, I seem to recall the last drunk show we had.

675
01:03:13,679 --> 01:03:20,181
[SPEAKER_27]: I was lying down in the hallway, kicking the wall, trying to run up the wall, and I was yelling, I'm in the Matrix, I'm in the Matrix.

676
01:03:20,901 --> 01:03:26,442
[SPEAKER_27]: And I don't even remember how we got to that on our radio show, but this was on air.

677
01:03:26,462 --> 01:03:28,303
[SPEAKER_21]: I remember eating half a box of waffles.

678
01:03:28,783 --> 01:03:30,124
[SPEAKER_21]: Which I paid you back for.

679
01:03:30,284 --> 01:03:30,624
[SPEAKER_21]: Finally.

680
01:03:30,725 --> 01:03:31,925
[SPEAKER_26]: I remember you paid me back.

681
01:03:31,986 --> 01:03:36,229
[SPEAKER_21]: I bought you a big old box of industrial-sized waffles.

682
01:03:36,369 --> 01:03:37,109
[SPEAKER_27]: And they were eaten.

683
01:03:37,450 --> 01:03:38,991
[SPEAKER_27]: So we'll have to do another drunk show sometime.

684
01:03:39,011 --> 01:03:40,532
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm happy because I got a toaster today.

685
01:03:41,172 --> 01:03:42,273
[SPEAKER_26]: A bagel-sized toaster.

686
01:03:42,293 --> 01:03:44,635
[SPEAKER_26]: And I hate bagels, but still a toaster.

687
01:03:44,855 --> 01:03:46,016
[SPEAKER_27]: They're good for cooking waffles in.

688
01:03:46,737 --> 01:03:46,937
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

689
01:03:47,277 --> 01:03:52,181
[SPEAKER_27]: You know, my friend told me that he was going to get me as a housewarming present a Hello Kitty toaster.

690
01:03:53,001 --> 01:03:53,702
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm still waiting.

691
01:03:53,722 --> 01:03:55,103
[SPEAKER_26]: What the hell is up with Hello Kitty?

692
01:03:55,143 --> 01:03:56,004
[SPEAKER_26]: I swear to God, it's like...

693
01:03:57,295 --> 01:03:58,756
[SPEAKER_26]: It's almost like the Nazi Revolution.

694
01:03:58,796 --> 01:04:01,077
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, it's like they have everything Hello Kitty.

695
01:04:01,197 --> 01:04:03,958
[SPEAKER_26]: It's just, Hello Kitty is going to take over the world.

696
01:04:04,679 --> 01:04:05,659
[SPEAKER_27]: Sanrio World!

697
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:08,621
[SPEAKER_27]: Did you play the Hello Kitty Roller Rescue at E3?

698
01:04:08,801 --> 01:04:09,941
[SPEAKER_27]: No, but I saw you play it.

699
01:04:10,001 --> 01:04:10,742
[SPEAKER_18]: So cute!

700
01:04:11,622 --> 01:04:12,823
[SPEAKER_18]: So cute!

701
01:04:13,023 --> 01:04:13,923
[SPEAKER_18]: So cute!

702
01:04:19,326 --> 01:04:20,827
[SPEAKER_27]: I like the suggestion from our chatroom.

703
01:04:21,147 --> 01:04:22,668
[SPEAKER_27]: Drunk podcast episode!

704
01:04:23,772 --> 01:04:26,174
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, it'd be really great for us with all the additional exposure.

705
01:04:26,194 --> 01:04:27,775
[SPEAKER_21]: We could bring the recorder, though, to the club.

706
01:04:29,317 --> 01:04:30,477
[SPEAKER_27]: What are we going to get at the club?

707
01:04:30,998 --> 01:04:31,899
[SPEAKER_27]: Nobody talks.

708
01:04:31,979 --> 01:04:32,759
[SPEAKER_27]: It's Gothic night.

709
01:04:32,779 --> 01:04:33,440
[SPEAKER_27]: Nobody talks.

710
01:04:34,261 --> 01:04:36,202
[SPEAKER_27]: They act pretentious and ignore each other.

711
01:04:36,322 --> 01:04:37,163
[SPEAKER_26]: At the club.

712
01:04:37,463 --> 01:04:41,867
[SPEAKER_26]: Can you actually hear someone talking four inches away from you at the club?

713
01:04:42,387 --> 01:04:43,028
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, seriously.

714
01:04:45,750 --> 01:04:49,133
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, boys and girls, Jamie and I go to the Goth Club on Sunday nights.

715
01:04:50,229 --> 01:04:51,829
[SPEAKER_27]: I go every week on Thursday.

716
01:04:51,949 --> 01:04:54,390
[SPEAKER_27]: Now, don't knock it till you tried it.

717
01:04:54,970 --> 01:05:01,851
[SPEAKER_27]: I know that, you know, a lot of you guys are in, like, high school, college, and you probably... Either you are a goth kid... You're emo!

718
01:05:01,971 --> 01:05:02,892
[SPEAKER_27]: Stop crying, emo kid!

719
01:05:02,952 --> 01:05:05,352
[SPEAKER_27]: Either you are a goth kid or you make fun of the goth kids.

720
01:05:05,792 --> 01:05:09,513
[SPEAKER_27]: So... Give him a break.

721
01:05:11,093 --> 01:05:13,754
[SPEAKER_26]: Honestly, folks, you should be dating the goth kids.

722
01:05:14,654 --> 01:05:19,175
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, because they're the ones that later on down the road end up being really slutty.

723
01:05:20,490 --> 01:05:21,251
[SPEAKER_26]: Now stop.

724
01:05:22,191 --> 01:05:25,094
[SPEAKER_26]: Hey, I am only going off of personal experience, okay?

725
01:05:25,114 --> 01:05:28,056
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, I knew a goth girl.

726
01:05:28,096 --> 01:05:33,680
[SPEAKER_26]: She wasn't very popular in high school, but she got out of high school, pierced like crazy, and then became a stripper.

727
01:05:34,361 --> 01:05:35,161
[SPEAKER_26]: Was she pierced?

728
01:05:36,262 --> 01:05:36,602
[SPEAKER_26]: Uh-huh.

729
01:05:36,723 --> 01:05:37,003
[SPEAKER_26]: Wow.

730
01:05:38,581 --> 01:05:38,941
[SPEAKER_26]: Every place.

731
01:05:39,222 --> 01:05:50,835
[SPEAKER_26]: But anyways, um, yeah, so that was actually the last time I went to the goth club was with this chick, and, um, because when I went there, then, um, some guy was trying to proposition me for sex.

732
01:05:53,999 --> 01:05:57,103
[SPEAKER_26]: Like, they wanted to take me home and give me money and

733
01:05:58,345 --> 01:05:59,086
[SPEAKER_26]: Have their way with me.

734
01:05:59,246 --> 01:06:01,528
[SPEAKER_26]: And that was the end of the golf club.

735
01:06:05,270 --> 01:06:06,832
[SPEAKER_27]: Have I ever taken you to the gay club?

736
01:06:07,232 --> 01:06:07,452
[SPEAKER_27]: No.

737
01:06:07,772 --> 01:06:08,913
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, you need to go sometime.

738
01:06:09,173 --> 01:06:10,054
[SPEAKER_21]: I like karaoke there.

739
01:06:10,314 --> 01:06:11,755
[SPEAKER_21]: Even though I don't sing anything, I just watch.

740
01:06:12,716 --> 01:06:13,617
[SPEAKER_27]: I sing.

741
01:06:13,837 --> 01:06:15,178
[SPEAKER_27]: We need this to be like a mission.

742
01:06:15,198 --> 01:06:16,699
[SPEAKER_27]: We need to take Loki to the gay bar.

743
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:19,001
[SPEAKER_27]: I know that Nellie wants to go.

744
01:06:19,461 --> 01:06:20,042
[SPEAKER_27]: I know she does.

745
01:06:23,581 --> 01:06:24,162
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't really care.

746
01:06:24,182 --> 01:06:26,884
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not like it's going to be like, oh my god, homosexuals!

747
01:06:26,904 --> 01:06:27,204
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh no!

748
01:06:27,304 --> 01:06:28,305
[SPEAKER_17]: I know you only lived with one.

749
01:06:28,325 --> 01:06:29,887
[SPEAKER_27]: I would just be like, oh whatever, I'm bored.

750
01:06:30,127 --> 01:06:31,588
[SPEAKER_27]: You only lived with one for how long?

751
01:06:33,830 --> 01:06:34,310
[SPEAKER_27]: Seriously.

752
01:06:34,691 --> 01:06:36,773
[SPEAKER_27]: You didn't catch gay from living with me, did you?

753
01:06:37,693 --> 01:06:38,294
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't think so.

754
01:06:38,714 --> 01:06:39,455
[SPEAKER_17]: I caught gay from you.

755
01:06:40,216 --> 01:06:41,217
[SPEAKER_21]: Remember the Pepsi bong?

756
01:06:43,719 --> 01:06:46,661
[SPEAKER_21]: This is years ago at our first March Madness.

757
01:06:48,183 --> 01:06:48,703
[SPEAKER_21]: And, uh...

758
01:06:50,146 --> 01:06:58,172
[SPEAKER_21]: It was Shiggle selling these huge things that look like a big bone, but I call them the Pepsi bong.

759
01:06:59,233 --> 01:07:02,415
[SPEAKER_21]: And I was passing it to Rob to take a drink.

760
01:07:02,476 --> 01:07:03,817
[SPEAKER_21]: I was like, I don't have any diseases.

761
01:07:04,317 --> 01:07:06,759
[SPEAKER_21]: And then he took a drink, passed it back, and I started drinking it.

762
01:07:06,779 --> 01:07:08,120
[SPEAKER_21]: And he goes, I do, I have gays.

763
01:07:08,180 --> 01:07:10,742
[SPEAKER_21]: I was like, oh my god, I caught gay.

764
01:07:10,762 --> 01:07:11,502
[SPEAKER_21]: And then I hugged Irene.

765
01:07:14,687 --> 01:07:17,209
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, very excellent point made in the chat room.

766
01:07:17,589 --> 01:07:20,712
[SPEAKER_27]: You guys should not tease the goth kids, you people that listen to the show.

767
01:07:21,152 --> 01:07:22,674
[SPEAKER_27]: You should not be teasing the goth kids.

768
01:07:22,974 --> 01:07:24,155
[SPEAKER_27]: You fucking play DDR.

769
01:07:25,136 --> 01:07:25,396
[SPEAKER_13]: Yep.

770
01:07:27,017 --> 01:07:29,119
[SPEAKER_26]: Correction, I do not play DDR.

771
01:07:31,021 --> 01:07:32,062
[SPEAKER_26]: I just do a radio show.

772
01:07:32,082 --> 01:07:33,222
[SPEAKER_27]: What, you play in the groove?

773
01:07:33,623 --> 01:07:34,403
[SPEAKER_27]: That's even worse.

774
01:07:34,423 --> 01:07:36,425
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't play in the groove.

775
01:07:37,046 --> 01:07:41,830
[SPEAKER_26]: No, honestly, but I think doing a radio show about DDR is probably worse than playing DDR.

776
01:07:43,407 --> 01:07:46,048
[SPEAKER_27]: Let me do a quick imitation of Jamie and I at the goth club.

777
01:07:51,189 --> 01:07:54,691
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, Jamie, I'm feeling so gothic.

778
01:07:56,351 --> 01:07:58,192
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm so gothic, Jamie.

779
01:07:58,412 --> 01:07:59,292
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, you know what?

780
01:07:59,332 --> 01:08:11,036
[SPEAKER_19]: That when the night comes, so do I. Jamie, I'm so gothic, bats fly out of my ass.

781
01:08:13,706 --> 01:08:15,207
[SPEAKER_21]: I could make a comment about that.

782
01:08:15,707 --> 01:08:19,548
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's go on the dance floor and swing our hands about.

783
01:08:20,149 --> 01:08:26,051
[SPEAKER_26]: Let's close our eyes and let our hands move freely above in the air and let the music flow into our body.

784
01:08:26,311 --> 01:08:29,373
[SPEAKER_26]: Let's see how many people we can pile in the cage.

785
01:08:30,233 --> 01:08:32,554
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, I get so turned on by cages.

786
01:08:33,114 --> 01:08:35,735
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm gonna make out with that thing over there.

787
01:08:36,295 --> 01:08:39,337
[SPEAKER_26]: I can't tell if it's man or woman but it has a cute corset.

788
01:08:39,617 --> 01:08:41,278
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, that's Jessica's purse.

789
01:08:43,107 --> 01:09:06,265
[SPEAKER_19]: I will make love to it even so I'm feeling so tragic I'm going to go outside and contemplate jumping off the curb I'm going to slit my wrists and then go to work tomorrow That's emo Oh, I'm sorry That's emo Anyways You know what I do?

790
01:09:06,946 --> 01:09:11,990
[SPEAKER_21]: I sit on the bench and get drunk That's what I do And then I watch everybody, I'm like

791
01:09:12,970 --> 01:09:14,651
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm too fucking drunk to move.

792
01:09:14,971 --> 01:09:15,571
[SPEAKER_21]: That's what I do.

793
01:09:16,472 --> 01:09:19,213
[SPEAKER_27]: The golf club for me is all about planning my outfit.

794
01:09:19,493 --> 01:09:21,274
[SPEAKER_27]: Because I get to be as eccentric as I want to be.

795
01:09:21,594 --> 01:09:25,696
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm thinking about wearing my I hate myself and I want to die shirt from English.com tonight.

796
01:09:25,716 --> 01:09:26,756
[SPEAKER_27]: Because that's always a fun choice.

797
01:09:26,776 --> 01:09:29,878
[SPEAKER_21]: I have my, uh, the one that you bought me.

798
01:09:30,678 --> 01:09:31,518
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh yeah, the reviver.

799
01:09:31,538 --> 01:09:34,200
[SPEAKER_26]: It would be fun to go to the golf club wearing all white.

800
01:09:34,700 --> 01:09:35,100
[SPEAKER_21]: People do.

801
01:09:37,461 --> 01:09:41,623
[SPEAKER_27]: I've seen, dude, you have to go to see the guy that dresses up like Michael Jackson.

802
01:09:44,150 --> 01:10:04,220
[SPEAKER_27]: that guy is my fucking hero one glove and the hat and everything and he fucking moonwalks to goth music that's awesome that's so weird that is awesome I gotta dress up like Pee Wee Herman and go there or something no actually no I don't sigh

803
01:10:06,576 --> 01:10:11,440
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh yeah, we talk about video games on this show once in a while, don't we?

804
01:10:11,460 --> 01:10:12,761
[SPEAKER_17]: What was that on Saturday Night Live?

805
01:10:12,821 --> 01:10:15,383
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know, I don't watch that.

806
01:10:15,423 --> 01:10:16,224
[SPEAKER_26]: That was great.

807
01:10:36,824 --> 01:10:37,906
[SPEAKER_17]: That actually amused me to no end.

808
01:10:50,829 --> 01:10:52,130
[SPEAKER_21]: I think Sarah Michelle Gellar.

809
01:10:52,150 --> 01:10:54,891
[SPEAKER_27]: That one was great.

810
01:10:55,491 --> 01:10:56,452
[SPEAKER_27]: Robert Downey Jr.

811
01:10:56,492 --> 01:10:57,232
[SPEAKER_27]: was the one I remember.

812
01:10:57,292 --> 01:10:57,532
[SPEAKER_27]: Anyway.

813
01:10:57,672 --> 01:10:58,293
[SPEAKER_21]: That was great.

814
01:10:58,553 --> 01:11:03,455
[SPEAKER_27]: We're going to open up the Skype line now to try and steer us back on to talking about games.

815
01:11:03,515 --> 01:11:07,657
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm going to open up the Skype line, www.orangelandreda.com and click on interact with us.

816
01:11:08,077 --> 01:11:10,218
[SPEAKER_27]: Funny thing is though, okay, this is the other thing.

817
01:11:10,438 --> 01:11:11,559
[SPEAKER_27]: Before I got off on the...

818
01:11:13,482 --> 01:11:15,223
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you for watching!

819
01:11:32,047 --> 01:11:36,330
[SPEAKER_26]: Also, what's interesting is that... Oh, that's the cool thing about the fact that my friend brought over Star Wars.

820
01:11:36,510 --> 01:11:39,511
[SPEAKER_26]: He brought me a big thing of vodka and I have orange juice at home.

821
01:11:40,112 --> 01:11:53,739
[SPEAKER_27]: Because it's part of a three-day weekend, Memorial Day weekend, we typically have less listeners on three-day weekend because people decide they can go out and get a life because it's, you know, another weekend night or something.

822
01:11:53,799 --> 01:11:56,680
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't know where you kids get off thinking that.

823
01:11:56,801 --> 01:11:57,641
[SPEAKER_27]: Wherever they can.

824
01:12:00,903 --> 01:12:01,223
[SPEAKER_27]: All right.

825
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:11,907
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, the skypline's open, and I'm noticing, per our list, there's a whopping two people online, so I'm not thinking the skypline's going to be a good idea tonight.

826
01:12:11,927 --> 01:12:14,008
[SPEAKER_27]: We might have to go back in the goth talk again.

827
01:12:14,749 --> 01:12:15,369
[SPEAKER_26]: No, you know what?

828
01:12:15,389 --> 01:12:16,510
[SPEAKER_26]: We'll get Paris Hilton chat.

829
01:12:16,610 --> 01:12:18,011
[SPEAKER_26]: House of Wax just came out, you know.

830
01:12:18,532 --> 01:12:22,135
[SPEAKER_26]: You know, I heard that movie kind of sucked, but I heard that she doesn't die quick enough.

831
01:12:22,435 --> 01:12:24,837
[SPEAKER_26]: I actually had free tickets to that, and I threw them away.

832
01:12:25,580 --> 01:12:29,243
[SPEAKER_21]: I just want to download the scene where she dies so that I can cheat in the industry for making that.

833
01:12:29,263 --> 01:12:32,546
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't know why you would, because that seems like an awful lot of work to me, but I guess you could do that.

834
01:12:32,566 --> 01:12:34,648
[SPEAKER_26]: Have you seen the new Paris Hilton commercial?

835
01:12:51,337 --> 01:12:54,178
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, why are people getting an uproar with that?

836
01:12:54,258 --> 01:12:58,160
[SPEAKER_26]: It's just Paris Hilton being stupid and slutty with a burger.

837
01:12:58,700 --> 01:13:05,223
[SPEAKER_27]: Is it just me, or is she really the wrong person to be selling, let's wait here, hamburgers?

838
01:13:06,043 --> 01:13:08,324
[SPEAKER_27]: Does the bitch look like she eats anything?

839
01:13:08,644 --> 01:13:08,984
[SPEAKER_26]: No.

840
01:13:09,385 --> 01:13:12,926
[SPEAKER_26]: She seems more of like a sausage hot dog type person to me.

841
01:13:13,026 --> 01:13:16,207
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't know if she can handle... The burger is bigger than she is, okay?

842
01:13:16,287 --> 01:13:17,148
[SPEAKER_26]: Honestly, folks.

843
01:13:17,848 --> 01:13:19,569
[SPEAKER_26]: The burger is bigger than she is.

844
01:13:20,373 --> 01:13:23,654
[SPEAKER_26]: She'd be like, oh my god, can you cut that lettuce in half, please?

845
01:13:23,675 --> 01:13:25,015
[SPEAKER_26]: That is way too much for me.

846
01:13:26,116 --> 01:13:27,136
[SPEAKER_26]: Like, oh my god!

847
01:13:28,257 --> 01:13:32,438
[SPEAKER_27]: The whole thing was just an excuse to use her tagline, that's hot.

848
01:13:33,619 --> 01:13:34,920
[SPEAKER_26]: Which isn't even really a tagline.

849
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:36,200
[SPEAKER_26]: Why does she have a tagline?

850
01:13:36,260 --> 01:13:37,161
[SPEAKER_26]: Why does she have a show?

851
01:13:37,541 --> 01:13:39,422
[SPEAKER_27]: All she's done is like, oh, there we go.

852
01:13:41,563 --> 01:13:42,663
[SPEAKER_27]: Saved by a phone call.

853
01:13:42,683 --> 01:13:44,124
[SPEAKER_27]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

854
01:13:45,066 --> 01:13:49,028
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank freaking God, stop the Paris Hilton crap.

855
01:13:49,168 --> 01:13:51,469
[SPEAKER_27]: Actually, it was kind of inadvertent.

856
01:13:51,509 --> 01:13:56,050
[SPEAKER_27]: We actually didn't mean to start doing the Paris Hilton chat, but I had to get that out about the commercial.

857
01:13:58,191 --> 01:13:59,212
[SPEAKER_28]: You could have spared all of us.

858
01:13:59,272 --> 01:13:59,892
[SPEAKER_28]: You really could have.

859
01:13:59,912 --> 01:14:00,292
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm sorry.

860
01:14:00,332 --> 01:14:01,332
[SPEAKER_27]: Hi, Jason, how are you?

861
01:14:01,353 --> 01:14:02,493
[SPEAKER_28]: Hi, Rob.

862
01:14:02,553 --> 01:14:06,274
[SPEAKER_27]: Now, this is the man with the internet penis, ladies and gentlemen.

863
01:14:07,155 --> 01:14:09,236
[SPEAKER_27]: No scripting on Konami polls needed.

864
01:14:09,676 --> 01:14:12,037
[SPEAKER_21]: He just keeps pressing the vote button over and over and over again.

865
01:14:12,877 --> 01:14:13,498
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh yeah, it's me.

866
01:14:13,658 --> 01:14:14,078
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm sorry.

867
01:14:16,100 --> 01:14:16,200
[SPEAKER_27]: No.

868
01:14:16,420 --> 01:14:17,681
[SPEAKER_27]: Did you write the script, Jason?

869
01:14:18,201 --> 01:14:18,402
[SPEAKER_27]: No.

870
01:14:18,502 --> 01:14:18,782
[SPEAKER_27]: Did you?

871
01:14:19,422 --> 01:14:19,522
[SPEAKER_27]: No.

872
01:14:19,542 --> 01:14:19,963
[SPEAKER_27]: Are you lying?

873
01:14:20,543 --> 01:14:20,683
[SPEAKER_27]: No.

874
01:14:20,763 --> 01:14:20,984
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright.

875
01:14:21,664 --> 01:14:22,184
[SPEAKER_27]: What's on your mind?

876
01:14:23,566 --> 01:14:28,429
[SPEAKER_28]: Um, I, well, I had Paris Hilton on my mind and I really wanted it out, so.

877
01:14:28,890 --> 01:14:31,452
[SPEAKER_27]: Who hasn't had Paris Hilton sitting on their head, huh?

878
01:14:32,136 --> 01:14:33,417
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, me until now.

879
01:14:34,718 --> 01:14:35,618
[SPEAKER_28]: Thanks, Rob.

880
01:14:35,678 --> 01:14:36,078
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm sorry.

881
01:14:36,459 --> 01:14:39,421
[SPEAKER_27]: See, now we're even getting other people calling in, but those people will have to wait because you're online.

882
01:14:39,441 --> 01:14:40,401
[SPEAKER_27]: No, it's alright.

883
01:14:41,402 --> 01:14:43,083
[SPEAKER_27]: We haven't talked to you since E3 was over.

884
01:14:43,123 --> 01:14:46,285
[SPEAKER_27]: What did you think of the old E3 and Konami's showing at E3?

885
01:14:47,125 --> 01:14:50,728
[SPEAKER_28]: Everybody was taunting me because I couldn't go, and it made me really, really sad.

886
01:14:50,828 --> 01:14:51,948
[SPEAKER_27]: Go tell them to go to hell.

887
01:14:52,909 --> 01:14:54,010
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, believe me, I already did.

888
01:14:54,170 --> 01:14:54,690
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, that's good.

889
01:14:55,402 --> 01:14:55,883
[SPEAKER_27]: That's mean.

890
01:14:55,904 --> 01:14:56,825
[SPEAKER_27]: That's a mean thing to do.

891
01:14:56,845 --> 01:14:57,747
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, you'll go next year.

892
01:14:57,968 --> 01:14:58,409
[SPEAKER_27]: It'll be fine.

893
01:14:58,449 --> 01:14:59,150
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, damn straight.

894
01:14:59,190 --> 01:14:59,551
[SPEAKER_27]: You better.

895
01:15:00,252 --> 01:15:01,114
[SPEAKER_28]: I'll definitely go.

896
01:15:01,375 --> 01:15:02,978
[SPEAKER_27]: What do you think of Konami's lineup this year?

897
01:15:03,820 --> 01:15:06,144
[SPEAKER_28]: I want to see a full thing of the Groovaloos.

898
01:15:07,701 --> 01:15:09,763
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, yeah, you know, I'm surprised.

899
01:15:09,783 --> 01:15:12,945
[SPEAKER_27]: There was like a minute-long clip that showed up on LiveJournal.

900
01:15:13,025 --> 01:15:15,688
[SPEAKER_26]: I know that Mel got a video of it.

901
01:15:15,908 --> 01:15:16,728
[SPEAKER_26]: Did Mel get a video of it?

902
01:15:16,748 --> 01:15:17,209
[SPEAKER_26]: At some point.

903
01:15:17,289 --> 01:15:21,012
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't know what he's doing with the video or where it went, but he got a video.

904
01:15:21,032 --> 01:15:22,493
[SPEAKER_27]: Mel works for us now, right?

905
01:15:22,813 --> 01:15:24,174
[SPEAKER_27]: So maybe we can hook something up.

906
01:15:25,215 --> 01:15:26,176
[SPEAKER_27]: Maybe we can hook something up.

907
01:15:26,816 --> 01:15:30,239
[SPEAKER_27]: I will ask Mel about that just for you, Jason, if he did get a video of that.

908
01:15:30,559 --> 01:15:32,181
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm surprised Shane didn't get a video of that.

909
01:15:32,221 --> 01:15:33,502
[SPEAKER_27]: Miklatov, Miklatov.

910
01:15:34,580 --> 01:15:36,482
[SPEAKER_27]: How many times did the Groovaloos perform throughout the whole thing?

911
01:15:36,502 --> 01:15:38,044
[SPEAKER_27]: I think it was like three, four, and three.

912
01:15:38,124 --> 01:15:39,706
[SPEAKER_27]: So it was like ten times they performed.

913
01:15:40,086 --> 01:15:42,208
[SPEAKER_27]: Mikltov was at least at seven of them.

914
01:15:42,529 --> 01:15:42,969
[SPEAKER_27]: At least.

915
01:15:44,471 --> 01:15:45,312
[SPEAKER_21]: I took a bunch of pictures.

916
01:15:45,732 --> 01:15:46,112
[SPEAKER_27]: You did?

917
01:15:46,232 --> 01:15:48,034
[SPEAKER_21]: Which you can see on orangeonjournal.com.

918
01:15:48,215 --> 01:15:49,356
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, what a lovely plug.

919
01:15:49,676 --> 01:15:51,378
[SPEAKER_27]: Lots of Groovaloos pictures on orangeonjournal.com.

920
01:15:51,438 --> 01:15:52,459
[SPEAKER_21]: And the Q1 grinned at me.

921
01:15:53,160 --> 01:15:53,961
[SPEAKER_21]: He was upside down.

922
01:15:56,604 --> 01:15:57,304
[SPEAKER_27]: You're all cute.

923
01:15:57,464 --> 01:16:00,945
[SPEAKER_27]: That's a good reminder that our E3 picture galleries are coming online.

924
01:16:01,285 --> 01:16:01,665
[SPEAKER_27]: Get this.

925
01:16:02,025 --> 01:16:04,026
[SPEAKER_27]: We're only through two days of the show.

926
01:16:05,626 --> 01:16:07,606
[SPEAKER_27]: 500 pictures already on the site.

927
01:16:09,067 --> 01:16:10,807
[SPEAKER_27]: And only one of them with me in it.

928
01:16:11,947 --> 01:16:14,388
[SPEAKER_27]: And we wonder why we're having bandwidth issues right now.

929
01:16:17,868 --> 01:16:20,169
[SPEAKER_28]: I smile every time I see an iPod commercial now.

930
01:16:20,749 --> 01:16:21,089
[SPEAKER_27]: Why is that?

931
01:16:22,311 --> 01:16:27,512
[SPEAKER_28]: Were you the one that told me that the Groovaloos were the iPod commercial mosaic people?

932
01:16:27,552 --> 01:16:27,672
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes.

933
01:16:27,712 --> 01:16:28,572
[SPEAKER_27]: That's what I was told anyway.

934
01:16:28,592 --> 01:16:30,953
[SPEAKER_27]: The Groovaloos are the iPod shadow dancers.

935
01:16:31,473 --> 01:16:36,093
[SPEAKER_27]: And the thing is that they are also going to be the shadow dancers in one of the new DDRs.

936
01:16:37,214 --> 01:16:44,155
[SPEAKER_27]: We never got a clear answer whether it was Ultramix 3 or Extreme 2, but one of them, the Groovaloos are actually being modeled.

937
01:16:44,535 --> 01:16:45,335
[SPEAKER_27]: Is it Ultramix 3?

938
01:16:45,975 --> 01:16:48,816
[SPEAKER_27]: That's what they kept saying at the show, but then I heard someone at the end say, no, it's Extreme 2.

939
01:16:49,496 --> 01:16:50,736
[SPEAKER_27]: So nobody seems to know.

940
01:16:51,511 --> 01:16:55,056
[SPEAKER_27]: Are they going to be the competitive dancers in the quest mode in Ultramix 3 perhaps?

941
01:17:09,844 --> 01:17:12,946
[SPEAKER_27]: What little bit I played of quest mode, it wasn't really set up like that.

942
01:17:13,066 --> 01:17:16,268
[SPEAKER_27]: It was very similar to Mission, in a way.

943
01:17:16,869 --> 01:17:17,329
[SPEAKER_27]: It was a thought.

944
01:17:17,349 --> 01:17:18,690
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, that was a good thought.

945
01:17:18,710 --> 01:17:19,710
[SPEAKER_28]: It would be an interesting one.

946
01:17:20,071 --> 01:17:20,391
[SPEAKER_27]: Very good.

947
01:17:21,131 --> 01:17:26,475
[SPEAKER_27]: By the way, also included in DarkSakura's pictures, tons of screen caps.

948
01:17:26,735 --> 01:17:29,297
[SPEAKER_27]: You want to see what the song banners for some of the new songs look like?

949
01:17:29,397 --> 01:17:29,877
[SPEAKER_27]: She got it.

950
01:17:30,417 --> 01:17:31,698
[SPEAKER_27]: Got all of them for DDR Mario.

951
01:17:32,018 --> 01:17:33,519
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, you want to see DDR Mario?

952
01:17:34,820 --> 01:17:35,241
[SPEAKER_27]: Go look.

953
01:17:35,421 --> 01:17:35,881
[SPEAKER_27]: It's all there.

954
01:17:36,468 --> 01:17:37,209
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, you people.

955
01:17:37,470 --> 01:17:41,076
[SPEAKER_28]: Go look at our website and don't put us over bandwidth.

956
01:17:41,116 --> 01:17:42,799
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, don't forget to look into that, Jason.

957
01:17:43,039 --> 01:17:43,640
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm working on that.

958
01:17:43,781 --> 01:17:44,462
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm already working on it.

959
01:17:44,482 --> 01:17:44,863
[SPEAKER_27]: Kisses.

960
01:17:45,444 --> 01:17:45,724
[SPEAKER_27]: All right.

961
01:17:47,387 --> 01:17:48,549
[SPEAKER_27]: Anything else you want to share with our listeners?

962
01:17:49,421 --> 01:17:50,802
[SPEAKER_28]: I just wanted you guys to stop.

963
01:17:52,563 --> 01:17:53,004
[SPEAKER_27]: That's fine.

964
01:17:53,244 --> 01:17:54,625
[SPEAKER_27]: We'll go off the air right now.

965
01:17:54,745 --> 01:17:56,046
[SPEAKER_27]: We got a goth club to get to.

966
01:17:56,086 --> 01:17:58,148
[SPEAKER_27]: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

967
01:17:58,728 --> 01:18:05,053
[SPEAKER_27]: We got coffins to sleep in and, you know, familiars to cast and, you know.

968
01:18:05,113 --> 01:18:05,973
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, you know what?

969
01:18:06,254 --> 01:18:07,895
[SPEAKER_21]: Stop talking about my private life.

970
01:18:11,958 --> 01:18:12,338
[SPEAKER_27]: All right.

971
01:18:13,979 --> 01:18:15,841
[SPEAKER_27]: I guess we'll hang up and let somebody else call in now, Jason.

972
01:18:16,354 --> 01:18:21,457
[SPEAKER_28]: I still want I Feel Toy Remix to be in Beatmania USA.

973
01:18:21,717 --> 01:18:23,899
[SPEAKER_28]: I think that would make a very, very good crossover.

974
01:18:24,099 --> 01:18:26,840
[SPEAKER_27]: I'll play I Feel Toy Remix just for you later, and you can imagine it.

975
01:18:27,381 --> 01:18:27,761
[SPEAKER_27]: How's that sound?

976
01:18:27,781 --> 01:18:28,862
[SPEAKER_28]: That would make me very happy.

977
01:18:29,022 --> 01:18:29,682
[SPEAKER_27]: All right, we'll do that.

978
01:18:30,323 --> 01:18:31,003
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, Rob.

979
01:18:31,043 --> 01:18:31,823
[SPEAKER_27]: You're welcome.

980
01:18:31,863 --> 01:18:32,544
[SPEAKER_28]: Bye, Jamie.

981
01:18:32,584 --> 01:18:33,084
[SPEAKER_28]: Bye, Matt.

982
01:18:33,564 --> 01:18:33,805
[SPEAKER_28]: Bye.

983
01:18:33,845 --> 01:18:35,386
[SPEAKER_28]: No, you cannot leave us.

984
01:18:35,566 --> 01:18:37,007
[SPEAKER_17]: You must come up here and visit.

985
01:18:37,707 --> 01:18:38,507
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, God, I want to.

986
01:18:39,688 --> 01:18:40,629
[SPEAKER_17]: We kidnap.

987
01:18:41,209 --> 01:18:41,489
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

988
01:18:41,930 --> 01:18:45,912
[SPEAKER_17]: Come to our dog castle, where we all gossip.

989
01:18:46,974 --> 01:18:47,934
[SPEAKER_27]: Bye, Jason.

990
01:18:48,314 --> 01:18:48,815
[SPEAKER_28]: Bye, Rob.

991
01:18:50,095 --> 01:18:52,876
[SPEAKER_27]: You know who the original old school goth is?

992
01:18:54,876 --> 01:18:55,296
[SPEAKER_27]: Elvira?

993
01:18:55,777 --> 01:18:55,897
[SPEAKER_27]: No.

994
01:18:56,977 --> 01:18:59,658
[SPEAKER_27]: One, two, ah, ah, ah.

995
01:19:00,658 --> 01:19:04,279
[SPEAKER_27]: Three, four, ah, ah, ah.

996
01:19:05,039 --> 01:19:05,579
[SPEAKER_21]: You know what?

997
01:19:05,860 --> 01:19:06,940
[SPEAKER_21]: We had Count Chocula, too.

998
01:19:07,480 --> 01:19:08,080
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, that's true.

999
01:19:08,120 --> 01:19:09,180
[SPEAKER_27]: Count Chocula was goth.

1000
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:10,441
[SPEAKER_27]: Hi, you're on Orange and Orange Radio.

1001
01:19:11,448 --> 01:19:12,129
[SPEAKER_27]: Hey, it's Dukes.

1002
01:19:12,449 --> 01:19:13,610
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, Dukes, what's up?

1003
01:19:14,631 --> 01:19:17,815
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm bored and listening to you guys talk about the gods.

1004
01:19:18,435 --> 01:19:18,776
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah.

1005
01:19:19,156 --> 01:19:23,620
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was so funny, like, as you guys were talking about that, I was watching, I was reading Maddox.

1006
01:19:23,741 --> 01:19:24,501
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys ever heard of that guy?

1007
01:19:25,002 --> 01:19:28,586
[SPEAKER_27]: Is that the one that makes fun of the preschool refrigerator art on his site?

1008
01:19:28,626 --> 01:19:29,707
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, a lot more than that.

1009
01:19:29,787 --> 01:19:30,668
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that guy, that guy.

1010
01:19:30,688 --> 01:19:31,068
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1011
01:19:31,148 --> 01:19:32,490
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, that's a pretty funny site.

1012
01:19:33,621 --> 01:19:36,202
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I was reading and he was talking about the gods, and it's so funny.

1013
01:19:36,222 --> 01:19:38,262
[SPEAKER_07]: He just, like, destroys them.

1014
01:19:38,422 --> 01:19:39,942
[SPEAKER_07]: It's hilarious.

1015
01:19:40,042 --> 01:19:40,822
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to hear that.

1016
01:19:41,042 --> 01:19:42,043
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, I don't want to hear it.

1017
01:19:42,063 --> 01:19:49,704
[SPEAKER_27]: To be fair, we're only teasing, you know, we like everybody equally.

1018
01:19:49,804 --> 01:19:50,584
[SPEAKER_21]: Except emo kids.

1019
01:19:50,764 --> 01:19:51,505
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, hi!

1020
01:19:51,605 --> 01:19:53,085
[SPEAKER_27]: No, no, no.

1021
01:19:53,845 --> 01:19:55,125
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm against emo kids also.

1022
01:19:55,145 --> 01:19:55,565
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty funny.

1023
01:19:55,605 --> 01:19:58,266
[SPEAKER_21]: Remember, down the road, not across the street.

1024
01:19:59,361 --> 01:20:01,403
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a couple funny stories about the emo kids.

1025
01:20:02,263 --> 01:20:07,246
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that, like, the arcade I go to normally, there's this kid who was just sitting on the ground, right?

1026
01:20:07,987 --> 01:20:11,609
[SPEAKER_07]: And some cop guy just came up and told him, oh, you can't sit there.

1027
01:20:11,930 --> 01:20:15,012
[SPEAKER_07]: So this kid just looks at the cop like, shoot him.

1028
01:20:16,092 --> 01:20:18,854
[SPEAKER_07]: So he's like, God, okay, whatever, you know, I'll stand up.

1029
01:20:18,894 --> 01:20:20,475
[SPEAKER_07]: And he starts, like, crying and runs away.

1030
01:20:20,595 --> 01:20:21,776
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, what the hell?

1031
01:20:21,916 --> 01:20:22,957
[SPEAKER_27]: You know what I don't understand?

1032
01:20:23,017 --> 01:20:24,838
[SPEAKER_27]: This is one of those generational things.

1033
01:20:24,878 --> 01:20:26,599
[SPEAKER_27]: This is when I really begin to feel old.

1034
01:20:26,799 --> 01:20:28,981
[SPEAKER_27]: Because back in my day, they didn't have emo kids.

1035
01:20:31,547 --> 01:20:32,668
[SPEAKER_27]: But this is why I don't understand.

1036
01:20:32,788 --> 01:20:34,468
[SPEAKER_27]: Everybody says emo sucks.

1037
01:20:34,589 --> 01:20:35,309
[SPEAKER_27]: Emo kids suck.

1038
01:20:35,669 --> 01:20:38,590
[SPEAKER_27]: I've never heard anybody say, I'm an emo kid.

1039
01:20:39,030 --> 01:20:39,591
[SPEAKER_27]: Leave me alone.

1040
01:20:41,451 --> 01:20:44,112
[SPEAKER_27]: Nobody ever says, I want to be emo when I grow up.

1041
01:20:45,013 --> 01:20:45,573
[SPEAKER_27]: Seriously.

1042
01:20:45,693 --> 01:20:47,194
[SPEAKER_27]: Where are the emo kids?

1043
01:20:47,514 --> 01:20:49,054
[SPEAKER_27]: Where are these people that suck?

1044
01:20:49,395 --> 01:20:52,336
[SPEAKER_27]: I think you all are making fun of something that doesn't even exist.

1045
01:20:53,527 --> 01:20:54,007
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, no.

1046
01:20:54,167 --> 01:20:58,049
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, if you want to see the emo kids, just like walk around, I guess, like a mall or something.

1047
01:20:58,309 --> 01:20:59,950
[SPEAKER_07]: And look for kids looking at the floor all the time.

1048
01:20:59,970 --> 01:21:00,530
[SPEAKER_07]: Walk in the Hot Topic.

1049
01:21:01,811 --> 01:21:02,051
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no.

1050
01:21:02,071 --> 01:21:04,932
[SPEAKER_27]: When I shop at Hot Topic, they've got video game shirts.

1051
01:21:04,972 --> 01:21:05,312
[SPEAKER_27]: Come on.

1052
01:21:06,293 --> 01:21:06,993
[SPEAKER_27]: And cool pants.

1053
01:21:07,453 --> 01:21:09,394
[SPEAKER_27]: You've got to admit Hot Topic has cool pants.

1054
01:21:09,574 --> 01:21:10,915
[SPEAKER_27]: You don't have to be emo to know that.

1055
01:21:11,855 --> 01:21:12,816
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, they're pretty cool.

1056
01:21:12,956 --> 01:21:14,437
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't even like Hot Topic much.

1057
01:21:17,558 --> 01:21:17,898
[SPEAKER_27]: All right.

1058
01:21:19,539 --> 01:21:21,760
[SPEAKER_27]: Anything gaming related you wanted to share with us?

1059
01:21:22,406 --> 01:21:24,968
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I got a bunch of AAAs today.

1060
01:21:25,269 --> 01:21:26,130
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm happy.

1061
01:21:26,550 --> 01:21:27,611
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, congratulations.

1062
01:21:27,971 --> 01:21:30,734
[SPEAKER_27]: Now, how many new AAAs did you get?

1063
01:21:31,354 --> 01:21:38,261
[SPEAKER_07]: I got AAA on Holic, AAA on Waka Laka, AAA on Sexy Planet, and I passed PSMO on Shuffle.

1064
01:21:43,018 --> 01:21:44,619
[SPEAKER_27]: But that's not a triple A. You just passed it.

1065
01:21:44,939 --> 01:21:46,479
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I passed it, but that's awesome.

1066
01:21:46,679 --> 01:21:47,599
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, yeah, I know, I know.

1067
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:48,400
[SPEAKER_27]: So that's four.

1068
01:21:48,680 --> 01:21:51,941
[SPEAKER_27]: So, your DDR penis grew by a whole four centimeters.

1069
01:21:51,981 --> 01:21:52,601
[SPEAKER_27]: How does it feel?

1070
01:21:53,461 --> 01:21:53,982
[SPEAKER_27]: It feels great.

1071
01:21:54,202 --> 01:21:54,542
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright.

1072
01:21:55,802 --> 01:21:56,082
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1073
01:21:56,422 --> 01:21:56,742
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright.

1074
01:21:56,882 --> 01:21:57,543
[SPEAKER_27]: I'll see you guys later.

1075
01:21:57,583 --> 01:21:58,343
[SPEAKER_27]: Go hump something.

1076
01:21:58,583 --> 01:22:00,144
[SPEAKER_27]: See ya.

1077
01:22:00,164 --> 01:22:00,424
[SPEAKER_26]: Bye.

1078
01:22:00,444 --> 01:22:00,704
[SPEAKER_26]: Bye.

1079
01:22:02,684 --> 01:22:03,485
[SPEAKER_26]: That's wonderful.

1080
01:22:04,545 --> 01:22:08,066
[SPEAKER_26]: I would, you know, Dr. Drew or something.

1081
01:22:08,726 --> 01:22:09,667
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, go hump something.

1082
01:22:10,467 --> 01:22:10,847
[SPEAKER_26]: For better.

1083
01:22:11,994 --> 01:22:14,375
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, he's got his penis grew by four centimeters.

1084
01:22:14,455 --> 01:22:15,436
[SPEAKER_27]: It's time to go hump something.

1085
01:22:16,297 --> 01:22:17,978
[SPEAKER_26]: Maybe he saw the new parasol pin.

1086
01:22:19,058 --> 01:22:19,979
[SPEAKER_27]: No, he AAA'd.

1087
01:22:20,019 --> 01:22:20,719
[SPEAKER_27]: Weren't you listening?

1088
01:22:21,480 --> 01:22:22,420
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, I'm sorry.

1089
01:22:23,261 --> 01:22:27,203
[SPEAKER_26]: I was looking for something that actually made, you know, I don't know.

1090
01:22:27,443 --> 01:22:33,887
[SPEAKER_27]: You ever sign up for one of those sites like NNR or GrooveStats, I think is another one for in the groove.

1091
01:22:34,307 --> 01:22:40,491
[SPEAKER_27]: Any of those sites where you can compare your DDR scores and you can issue challenges to each other and stuff like that?

1092
01:22:42,870 --> 01:22:48,874
[SPEAKER_26]: Challenge 1, go outside.

1093
01:22:49,334 --> 01:22:50,996
[SPEAKER_27]: Challenge 1, run around the track.

1094
01:22:51,356 --> 01:22:52,617
[SPEAKER_27]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1095
01:22:55,399 --> 01:22:55,799
[SPEAKER_27]: Hello.

1096
01:22:57,640 --> 01:22:58,321
[SPEAKER_19]: Housekeeping.

1097
01:23:00,462 --> 01:23:03,444
[SPEAKER_19]: Welcome to my castle.

1098
01:23:03,945 --> 01:23:04,465
[SPEAKER_19]: Candygram.

1099
01:23:05,325 --> 01:23:07,027
[SPEAKER_27]: You are on the Orange Lounge.

1100
01:23:07,047 --> 01:23:09,789
[SPEAKER_27]: No, seriously, you there?

1101
01:23:09,829 --> 01:23:10,229
[SPEAKER_27]: Can you hear us?

1102
01:23:11,021 --> 01:23:12,102
[SPEAKER_27]: That would be a negative.

1103
01:23:12,843 --> 01:23:14,144
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, it's one of our regular callers.

1104
01:23:14,424 --> 01:23:14,965
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, he hung up.

1105
01:23:17,347 --> 01:23:23,712
[SPEAKER_27]: If you kids are unsure if your Skype is working or not, give Echo123 a call, and you can always test to make sure your Skype's working.

1106
01:23:23,732 --> 01:23:28,877
[SPEAKER_27]: You can't add Echo123 to your buddy list, but you can give Echo123 a call.

1107
01:23:29,538 --> 01:23:33,541
[SPEAKER_27]: So give Echo123 a call, and you can test if your Skype is working and see what you sound like.

1108
01:23:35,022 --> 01:23:35,363
[SPEAKER_27]: Amazing.

1109
01:23:36,872 --> 01:23:39,074
[SPEAKER_27]: Because people are fundamentally stupid.

1110
01:23:59,932 --> 01:24:00,653
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, I don't know.

1111
01:24:00,693 --> 01:24:02,355
[SPEAKER_27]: I mean, a lot of people do this.

1112
01:24:02,675 --> 01:24:19,452
[SPEAKER_27]: Like, if I were to sign up for something like that, I would do it for myself to track my own records because I believe it's the one place where In The Groove really is superior to DDR is the memory support where the memory card on PlayStation, that whole link thing, eh, not so hot.

1113
01:24:19,752 --> 01:24:21,995
[SPEAKER_27]: But the USB In The Groove is awesome.

1114
01:24:22,395 --> 01:24:43,256
[SPEAKER_27]: and so really with that you don't need a freaking website to track your scores but on DDR you kind of do so I could see myself signing up for a website strictly to track my scores on DDR to watch my own improvement because it feels good to watch yourself improve but the whole like challenging other people and like OMG I got one more great than you and all that stuff I don't get that who cares why who cares

1115
01:24:45,290 --> 01:24:57,915
[SPEAKER_27]: No matter how good you are at DDR, or at 2DX, or at Poppin' Music, or at any of these games, or at goth dancing, or whatever, there will always be somebody better than you, somewhere out there.

1116
01:24:57,975 --> 01:25:00,656
[SPEAKER_27]: You may not know it, but somebody out there is better than you.

1117
01:25:03,237 --> 01:25:08,899
[SPEAKER_27]: And the person who's the best in the world, there's somebody better than them, at something else.

1118
01:25:11,020 --> 01:25:14,421
[SPEAKER_27]: That was my motivational thought for today.

1119
01:25:17,648 --> 01:25:20,390
[SPEAKER_27]: Regardless, somebody out there is better than you, so stop trying.

1120
01:25:23,612 --> 01:25:23,912
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright.

1121
01:25:25,353 --> 01:25:27,394
[SPEAKER_27]: Let's go to the cage match tonight, boys and girls.

1122
01:25:27,454 --> 01:25:29,015
[SPEAKER_27]: We'll do more Skype calls later.

1123
01:25:29,235 --> 01:25:34,178
[SPEAKER_27]: I think people are afraid to call in now because I wasn't really making fun of that last guy.

1124
01:25:34,198 --> 01:25:35,679
[SPEAKER_27]: I mean, I was kind of congratulating him.

1125
01:25:35,699 --> 01:25:38,161
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't know what your guys' problem is.

1126
01:25:38,281 --> 01:25:38,921
[SPEAKER_27]: Wah, wah, wah.

1127
01:25:41,710 --> 01:25:41,990
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright.

1128
01:25:43,151 --> 01:25:45,073
[SPEAKER_27]: Um... We gotta go to the cage match.

1129
01:25:45,093 --> 01:25:49,757
[SPEAKER_27]: But in order for me to go to the cage match, I've gotta find Loki's song that he wanted played.

1130
01:25:53,400 --> 01:25:54,901
[SPEAKER_27]: I hope I can find it, or we're in trouble.

1131
01:25:55,042 --> 01:25:56,223
[SPEAKER_27]: Do you remember what the file name was?

1132
01:25:58,024 --> 01:26:01,427
[SPEAKER_26]: Um, I believe it started with a D. Uh-oh.

1133
01:26:04,710 --> 01:26:05,250
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, God.

1134
01:26:05,290 --> 01:26:06,351
[SPEAKER_26]: Do I have to look it up again?

1135
01:26:08,033 --> 01:26:08,413
[SPEAKER_27]: Maybe.

1136
01:26:08,553 --> 01:26:09,234
[SPEAKER_27]: This isn't good.

1137
01:26:09,955 --> 01:26:10,775
[SPEAKER_26]: It's two letters.

1138
01:26:10,856 --> 01:26:13,877
[SPEAKER_26]: It starts off as something something and then dash.

1139
01:26:13,917 --> 01:26:16,458
[SPEAKER_27]: I will look for that so that we don't waste too much show.

1140
01:26:17,399 --> 01:26:20,120
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm going to reorder things a little bit.

1141
01:26:20,541 --> 01:26:24,103
[SPEAKER_27]: Let's go into playing that song from Silent Hill 4.

1142
01:26:25,543 --> 01:26:28,885
[SPEAKER_27]: And this is one of the songs that's in the new song pack.

1143
01:26:29,005 --> 01:26:30,525
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't remember if it's song pack 10 or 11.

1144
01:26:30,765 --> 01:26:32,346
[SPEAKER_27]: I think it's song pack 10 this song shows up in.

1145
01:26:32,646 --> 01:26:34,007
[SPEAKER_27]: And it's really weird, you guys.

1146
01:26:34,027 --> 01:26:35,267
[SPEAKER_27]: This is a really weird song.

1147
01:26:36,268 --> 01:26:38,489
[SPEAKER_27]: And that's kind of the reason I want to play this.

1148
01:26:38,629 --> 01:26:40,290
[SPEAKER_27]: They should put a dog song in there.

1149
01:26:41,070 --> 01:26:44,851
[SPEAKER_27]: So that you can hear kind of how weird some of these DDR songs are getting.

1150
01:26:45,132 --> 01:26:47,933
[SPEAKER_27]: So this is Waverer, the slide mix.

1151
01:26:48,753 --> 01:26:50,674
[SPEAKER_27]: And we'll be back after this with the cage match.

1152
01:27:43,726 --> 01:27:44,426
DarkSakura.com

1153
01:28:23,499 --> 01:28:24,782
Thank you for watching!

1154
01:28:54,046 --> 01:28:54,747
Thanks for watching!

1155
01:29:53,479 --> 01:29:54,039
[SPEAKER_27]: Waiverer, The Slide Mix

1156
01:30:18,766 --> 01:30:22,888
[SPEAKER_27]: But you can't say there isn't a little variety in your USDDR games, so there you have it.

1157
01:30:24,148 --> 01:30:24,509
[SPEAKER_27]: All right.

1158
01:30:26,689 --> 01:30:33,192
[SPEAKER_27]: Before we get into tonight's cage match, I thought we'd go ahead and let Loki do a sim update if you have something for us, Loki.

1159
01:30:33,352 --> 01:30:34,233
[SPEAKER_27]: That's a good question.

1160
01:30:34,413 --> 01:30:39,575
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't think we do, though, but at least last time I checked, which was yesterday.

1161
01:30:41,096 --> 01:30:42,036
[SPEAKER_26]: But let's give it a... Oh!

1162
01:30:42,376 --> 01:30:42,857
[SPEAKER_26]: I forgot.

1163
01:30:43,097 --> 01:30:44,317
[SPEAKER_26]: Actually, I forgot one the other day.

1164
01:30:46,058 --> 01:30:48,199
[SPEAKER_26]: Not that you really care, but guess what?

1165
01:30:48,817 --> 01:30:53,948
[SPEAKER_26]: Debt Mania, Alpha something or other, Release Candidate 3

1166
01:30:56,284 --> 01:30:57,564
[SPEAKER_26]: And what can you expect in that?

1167
01:30:57,845 --> 01:30:58,385
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't know.

1168
01:30:58,565 --> 01:30:59,465
[SPEAKER_26]: Not much different.

1169
01:30:59,566 --> 01:31:02,627
[SPEAKER_26]: But hey, it's a new version of Step Mania.

1170
01:31:03,127 --> 01:31:03,748
[SPEAKER_26]: And you know what?

1171
01:31:03,808 --> 01:31:06,910
[SPEAKER_26]: I completely forgot that they were even updating that thing to be honest.

1172
01:31:07,370 --> 01:31:08,490
[SPEAKER_26]: Because it's been that long.

1173
01:31:09,231 --> 01:31:10,371
[SPEAKER_26]: But yeah, new version.

1174
01:31:10,391 --> 01:31:11,952
[SPEAKER_26]: Get it at stepmania.com.

1175
01:31:13,273 --> 01:31:14,834
[SPEAKER_26]: Be sure to upgrade it.

1176
01:31:14,954 --> 01:31:18,236
[SPEAKER_26]: And I think there might be a driver missing so you might have to download that too.

1177
01:31:18,336 --> 01:31:20,457
[SPEAKER_26]: But it's not that hard to find.

1178
01:31:20,497 --> 01:31:21,257
[SPEAKER_26]: I found it pretty quick.

1179
01:31:21,958 --> 01:31:22,338
[SPEAKER_26]: But anyways.

1180
01:31:23,859 --> 01:31:25,500
[SPEAKER_26]: Let's see what's going on in the sim scene.

1181
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:33,022
[SPEAKER_26]: Because I know as far as UK stuff, DDRUK hasn't released the official packs yet, but I think they're getting pretty close there.

1182
01:31:33,062 --> 01:31:42,566
[SPEAKER_26]: They have to just tweak a few things on them, because they actually ripped all the music and the images and all that stuff using a certain program.

1183
01:31:43,266 --> 01:31:45,627
[SPEAKER_26]: But let's see here.

1184
01:31:46,587 --> 01:31:50,889
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, I'm not having much high hopes here for the fan mix stuff, but...

1185
01:31:53,260 --> 01:31:53,400
[SPEAKER_26]: No.

1186
01:31:54,101 --> 01:31:54,421
[SPEAKER_26]: Nothing.

1187
01:31:54,681 --> 01:31:54,961
[SPEAKER_26]: Nada.

1188
01:31:57,422 --> 01:31:59,663
[SPEAKER_26]: Pretty much Siberia Style 2.6 came out.

1189
01:32:00,344 --> 01:32:02,905
[SPEAKER_26]: That was the one that was very similar to Techno Fiend.

1190
01:32:03,365 --> 01:32:04,946
[SPEAKER_26]: I actually downloaded it and tried it out.

1191
01:32:05,066 --> 01:32:05,746
[SPEAKER_26]: It's pretty cool.

1192
01:32:06,107 --> 01:32:09,348
[SPEAKER_26]: It actually works with this release, Candidate 3, so that's pretty nice.

1193
01:32:10,009 --> 01:32:16,952
[SPEAKER_26]: And then D3 Mix 2.5, four songs have been announced for that, but they haven't really launched anything.

1194
01:32:17,713 --> 01:32:17,833
[SPEAKER_26]: And...

1195
01:32:19,554 --> 01:32:26,263
[SPEAKER_26]: Really, if you want all the news, like, you know, up to date and everything, there's a website, B-Music Report, that you can go to.

1196
01:32:26,944 --> 01:32:28,646
[SPEAKER_26]: And really, there's nothing there.

1197
01:32:29,187 --> 01:32:30,688
[SPEAKER_26]: Ooh, wait a second.

1198
01:32:31,470 --> 01:32:31,910
[SPEAKER_26]: Hold on.

1199
01:32:35,335 --> 01:32:35,775
[SPEAKER_26]: Uh...

1200
01:32:38,005 --> 01:32:40,085
[SPEAKER_26]: Hmm, what have we here?

1201
01:32:41,266 --> 01:32:43,106
[SPEAKER_26]: Apparently, I would be wrong.

1202
01:32:44,286 --> 01:32:46,907
[SPEAKER_26]: No, actually, they did announce something.

1203
01:32:46,927 --> 01:32:50,287
[SPEAKER_26]: It looks like there's screenshots of FoonMix 2.

1204
01:32:51,548 --> 01:32:53,108
[SPEAKER_26]: That's kind of neat.

1205
01:32:54,148 --> 01:32:56,888
[SPEAKER_26]: Just basically some screenshots to show you what's going to be coming up.

1206
01:32:57,109 --> 01:33:05,130
[SPEAKER_26]: And if it's not a surprise, it's up to the same quality as the original FoonMix, if not better.

1207
01:33:06,698 --> 01:33:12,082
[SPEAKER_26]: So, take a look at that, and more to come soon enough.

1208
01:33:14,644 --> 01:33:16,945
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, a video.

1209
01:33:18,046 --> 01:33:19,287
[SPEAKER_26]: There's a video of FunMix.

1210
01:33:20,508 --> 01:33:21,709
[SPEAKER_26]: We'll check that out.

1211
01:33:21,789 --> 01:33:23,290
[SPEAKER_27]: Videos will make great radio, by the way.

1212
01:33:23,730 --> 01:33:26,733
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, I'm not going to play the video, because it's on a different computer.

1213
01:33:26,753 --> 01:33:30,775
[SPEAKER_26]: But anyways, if you're interested, you can go to http://funmix.com

1214
01:33:34,431 --> 01:33:40,055
[SPEAKER_26]: That's F-O-O-N-M-I-X dot nothing dot S-H.

1215
01:33:40,956 --> 01:33:50,803
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't know what you know about these mixes here, but Laser123454321 in our chatroom is yelling about DDR9 Red has some early release version that's out.

1216
01:33:50,943 --> 01:33:56,387
[SPEAKER_26]: DDR9 Red is basically the 2DX Red skin for, or theme for...

1217
01:33:58,793 --> 01:34:01,275
[SPEAKER_27]: Stepmania, and DDR Extreme VS4.

1218
01:34:01,595 --> 01:34:03,136
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't know what that one's all about.

1219
01:34:03,317 --> 01:34:04,638
[SPEAKER_26]: It's just a DDR Extreme skin.

1220
01:34:05,118 --> 01:34:05,498
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, fun.

1221
01:34:06,299 --> 01:34:07,039
[SPEAKER_26]: More skins.

1222
01:34:08,401 --> 01:34:09,982
[SPEAKER_26]: Skins, skins, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1223
01:34:11,043 --> 01:34:13,264
[SPEAKER_26]: Honestly, folks, stick with Siberia style 2.6.

1224
01:34:13,545 --> 01:34:14,946
[SPEAKER_26]: It's the best one out there.

1225
01:34:16,414 --> 01:34:17,815
[SPEAKER_26]: Alright, let's go into tonight's cage match boys and girls.

1226
01:34:32,947 --> 01:34:33,667
[SPEAKER_27]: www.orangeloungeradio.com

1227
01:34:51,388 --> 01:34:53,570
[SPEAKER_27]: Last week, we didn't have a cage match actually.

1228
01:34:53,610 --> 01:34:59,995
[SPEAKER_27]: For the first time in about 100 episodes, we did not hold a cage match of any sort because we were too busy talking about E3.

1229
01:35:00,115 --> 01:35:04,499
[SPEAKER_27]: So, by default, this song ended up getting a second week in rotation.

1230
01:35:05,680 --> 01:35:06,440
[SPEAKER_27]: Imagine that.

1231
01:35:06,540 --> 01:35:07,381
[SPEAKER_27]: So, we'll see.

1232
01:35:07,421 --> 01:35:10,804
[SPEAKER_27]: Will it survive one more week and get closer to retirement?

1233
01:35:11,605 --> 01:35:13,346
[SPEAKER_27]: On a personal note, I really hope not.

1234
01:35:13,486 --> 01:35:14,347
[SPEAKER_27]: But we'll find out.

1235
01:35:15,007 --> 01:35:17,269
[SPEAKER_27]: Darth Punk is song number one.

1236
01:35:17,389 --> 01:35:19,051
[SPEAKER_27]: Ted Koppel's Gin and Juice.

1237
01:35:20,182 --> 01:35:24,263
[SPEAKER_27]: You voted it in, here it is, a clip, because it did win last time.

1238
01:35:24,703 --> 01:35:26,863
[SPEAKER_27]: And then you'll get to hear two new songs in their entirety.

1239
01:35:26,883 --> 01:35:28,363
[SPEAKER_27]: Here it is, Ted Koppel, Gin & Juice.

1240
01:35:28,604 --> 01:35:30,684
[SPEAKER_01]: Ain't leaving till six in the morning.

1241
01:35:31,484 --> 01:35:32,484
[SPEAKER_01]: So what you wanna do?

1242
01:35:32,704 --> 01:35:35,885
[SPEAKER_01]: Shit, I've got a pocket full of rubbers and my homeboys do too.

1243
01:35:36,585 --> 01:35:43,226
[SPEAKER_01]: So turn off the lights and close the doors, but... Yeah, so we gon' smoke an ounce to this.

1244
01:35:43,426 --> 01:35:46,687
[SPEAKER_01]: Jeez up, hose down while you motherfuckers bounce to this.

1245
01:35:50,083 --> 01:35:54,405
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Ted Koppel, and this is Laid Back.

1246
01:35:54,745 --> 01:36:03,749
[SPEAKER_01]: Sources close to the White House today confirm that the president is laid back.

1247
01:36:06,209 --> 01:36:10,950
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that I got me some Seagram's Gin, everybody got they cups, but they ain't chipped in.

1248
01:36:11,411 --> 01:36:13,611
[SPEAKER_01]: Now this types of shit happens all the time.

1249
01:36:13,651 --> 01:36:16,112
[SPEAKER_01]: You gotta get yours, but fool, I gotta get mine.

1250
01:36:16,532 --> 01:36:19,313
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything is fine when you're listening to the T.E.D.

1251
01:36:19,413 --> 01:36:22,874
[SPEAKER_01]: I got the cultivatin' music that be captivatin' he who listens.

1252
01:36:23,354 --> 01:36:29,257
[SPEAKER_01]: To the words that I speak as I take me a drink to the middle of the street and get to mackin' this bitch named Katie.

1253
01:36:29,277 --> 01:36:29,837
[SPEAKER_01]: Katie, correct?

1254
01:36:30,017 --> 01:36:31,698
[SPEAKER_01]: She used to be the homeboy's lady.

1255
01:36:31,818 --> 01:36:32,378
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that bitch?

1256
01:36:32,818 --> 01:36:38,461
[SPEAKER_01]: Eighty degrees when I tell that bitch, please raise up off these NUTs cause you get none of these at ease.

1257
01:36:39,581 --> 01:36:43,303
[SPEAKER_01]: As I mob with the dog pound field that breathes biatch, I'm just.

1258
01:36:45,784 --> 01:36:50,126
[SPEAKER_01]: Earthquakes rocked Tokyo, Japan today as residents were laid back.

1259
01:36:55,177 --> 01:37:00,521
[SPEAKER_01]: Residents in a small New England town are terrified as a mass murderer is laid back.

1260
01:37:00,541 --> 01:37:04,945
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, that was a clip of song number one, Darth Punk, Ted Koppel's Gin and Juice.

1261
01:37:16,210 --> 01:37:17,771
[SPEAKER_27]: Didn't that originate on something awful?

1262
01:37:19,231 --> 01:37:20,451
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm getting a nod, yes.

1263
01:37:21,191 --> 01:37:21,592
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, it is.

1264
01:37:21,692 --> 01:37:22,572
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, that site's fun.

1265
01:37:22,712 --> 01:37:26,193
[SPEAKER_21]: I hated putting that into the fortune cookie so many times.

1266
01:37:26,473 --> 01:37:30,214
[SPEAKER_27]: That site is fun for the whole family.

1267
01:37:30,614 --> 01:37:30,914
[SPEAKER_15]: It is.

1268
01:37:31,154 --> 01:37:32,414
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, definitely.

1269
01:37:32,434 --> 01:37:34,915
[SPEAKER_27]: They should be showing that website in Mormon churches everywhere.

1270
01:37:35,455 --> 01:37:37,115
[SPEAKER_27]: All right, let's move on to song number two.

1271
01:37:37,475 --> 01:37:39,656
[SPEAKER_27]: Song number two is my pick, my pick.

1272
01:37:41,036 --> 01:37:43,557
[SPEAKER_27]: And I picked this song because it's a cover of ABBA.

1273
01:37:44,560 --> 01:37:46,061
[SPEAKER_27]: and I can't get enough ABBA covers.

1274
01:37:46,381 --> 01:37:47,982
[SPEAKER_27]: And this is actually from a new song.

1275
01:37:48,022 --> 01:37:56,465
[SPEAKER_27]: I think it's supposed to showcase like unknown dance artists because it was called like Future Dance or something like that and I never heard of anybody on the CD.

1276
01:37:56,826 --> 01:37:58,186
[SPEAKER_27]: And this mist was actually pretty good.

1277
01:37:58,226 --> 01:37:58,867
[SPEAKER_27]: I kind of liked it.

1278
01:37:58,907 --> 01:38:02,488
[SPEAKER_27]: It's a little different considering the original song is very slow.

1279
01:38:02,548 --> 01:38:03,529
[SPEAKER_27]: I like what they did with this.

1280
01:38:04,489 --> 01:38:09,051
[SPEAKER_27]: So this is DJ Tom Del Sar with The Winner Takes It All, 2005.

1281
01:38:09,091 --> 01:38:09,311
[SPEAKER_27]: Enjoy.

1282
01:38:17,567 --> 01:38:18,828
Thanks for watching!

1283
01:39:39,597 --> 01:39:43,761
[SPEAKER_18]: Thinking I'd be strong then But I wasn't true Playing Bible Groove

1284
01:40:22,307 --> 01:40:30,995
[SPEAKER_18]: Like I used to kiss you Does it feel the same When she calls your name Somewhere deep inside You must know I miss you But what can I say Rules must be obeyed

1285
01:41:18,025 --> 01:41:46,290
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't wanna talk If it makes you feel sad And I understand You've come to shake my hand I apologize If it makes you feel bad Seeing me so tense No self confidence But you see

1286
01:41:47,786 --> 01:41:54,367
[SPEAKER_18]: The winner takes it all The winner takes it all The winner takes it all The winner takes it all

1287
01:42:41,505 --> 01:42:43,827
[SPEAKER_27]: Alrighty, that's song number two in tonight's cage match.

1288
01:42:44,227 --> 01:42:46,929
[SPEAKER_27]: DJ Tom Del Sar, the winner takes it all, 2005.

1289
01:42:47,349 --> 01:42:52,913
[SPEAKER_27]: Did that song take it all, or are you gonna, uh, I don't know, take a crap on it?

1290
01:42:52,953 --> 01:42:53,553
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't know, let's see.

1291
01:42:53,713 --> 01:42:54,414
[SPEAKER_27]: DarkSakura!

1292
01:42:54,454 --> 01:42:57,616
[SPEAKER_21]: That song was really good for me to take a big ol' shit on.

1293
01:42:57,636 --> 01:42:59,477
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, it wasn't too bad.

1294
01:42:59,557 --> 01:43:00,818
[SPEAKER_21]: It's, again, trance.

1295
01:43:01,418 --> 01:43:03,760
[SPEAKER_21]: A very generic trance mix of that.

1296
01:43:03,920 --> 01:43:06,462
[SPEAKER_21]: And the original was so good, I guess, you know, I like ABBA.

1297
01:43:07,222 --> 01:43:10,364
[SPEAKER_21]: But that gets a five, it was just mediocre.

1298
01:43:10,805 --> 01:43:11,305
[SPEAKER_21]: Not exciting.

1299
01:43:12,849 --> 01:43:16,932
[SPEAKER_26]: I could have sworn I've heard that song before, like, just as another transfer.

1300
01:43:17,132 --> 01:43:19,473
[SPEAKER_27]: It's very similar to Erotic's version.

1301
01:43:19,773 --> 01:43:23,676
[SPEAKER_27]: It's not, they do some different things with the vocals, but it's somewhat similar.

1302
01:43:24,396 --> 01:43:25,677
[SPEAKER_26]: That just didn't do much.

1303
01:43:25,917 --> 01:43:26,758
[SPEAKER_26]: It's just average.

1304
01:43:27,198 --> 01:43:27,878
[SPEAKER_26]: It's a six.

1305
01:43:28,739 --> 01:43:29,139
[SPEAKER_26]: Bradley.

1306
01:43:31,100 --> 01:43:32,221
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, I'm set, Carter Fields.

1307
01:43:39,638 --> 01:43:56,582
[SPEAKER_27]: I like it, it's ABBA, and since ABBA's a bunch of fuckers and they're never gonna reunite, that's the best thing we're gonna get, so, um, I like it, my only issue with it is I think it's a little bit long, which is kinda weird, because the original song was long, and that was fine, but this one was just a little too long for me, so...

1308
01:43:57,182 --> 01:43:58,023
[SPEAKER_27]: I give it an 8.

1309
01:43:59,184 --> 01:44:03,687
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright, let's go on to song number 3, DarkSakura, what did you pick for us tonight?

1310
01:44:03,828 --> 01:44:06,950
[SPEAKER_21]: I've been wanting to put this song in the cage match for the past three months.

1311
01:44:08,071 --> 01:44:12,254
[SPEAKER_21]: Finally, now that Demon Days has been released, I can legally put this song in the cage match.

1312
01:44:12,815 --> 01:44:16,258
[SPEAKER_21]: So it's Gorillaz with Dare, which is actually going to be the next single.

1313
01:44:17,559 --> 01:44:23,223
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright, here it is, a sneak peek at the next single from Gorillaz, and it's Jamie's cage match pick, Dare, song number 3.

1314
01:44:23,463 --> 01:44:23,684
[SPEAKER_27]: Enjoy!

1315
01:44:25,290 --> 01:44:43,153
[SPEAKER_18]: It's coming out, it's coming out, it's coming out, it's coming out, it's coming out, it's coming out, it's coming out.

1316
01:44:43,253 --> 01:44:43,793
It's there.

1317
01:44:43,873 --> 01:44:48,914
[SPEAKER_18]: It's there.

1318
01:44:48,974 --> 01:44:51,655
[SPEAKER_18]: You've got the pressure on you.

1319
01:44:51,695 --> 01:44:52,135
[SPEAKER_18]: You just...

1320
01:48:32,523 --> 01:48:35,990
[SPEAKER_27]: All right, song number three in tonight's cage match, Gorilla's Dare.

1321
01:48:36,711 --> 01:48:38,875
[SPEAKER_27]: I dare you to tell me if you liked it or hated it.

1322
01:48:38,915 --> 01:48:39,597
[SPEAKER_27]: DarkSakura.

1323
01:48:39,797 --> 01:48:40,138
[SPEAKER_27]: Ten.

1324
01:48:41,621 --> 01:48:42,021
[SPEAKER_27]: Of course.

1325
01:48:42,041 --> 01:48:42,482
[SPEAKER_21]: Gorilla's.

1326
01:48:42,683 --> 01:48:43,143
[SPEAKER_27]: Any reason?

1327
01:48:44,289 --> 01:48:47,591
[SPEAKER_21]: Actually, this is one of the better tracks on the new CD.

1328
01:48:48,091 --> 01:48:57,635
[SPEAKER_21]: It's definitely the most upbeat track on the whole CD, because most everything else is really dark, but this was really cool, and it was, uh, what's his name from the Happy Mondays?

1329
01:48:58,576 --> 01:49:00,977
[SPEAKER_21]: One of the other collaborators on that track.

1330
01:49:02,158 --> 01:49:02,878
[SPEAKER_25]: Pretty cool.

1331
01:49:03,818 --> 01:49:04,599
[SPEAKER_26]: Alright, uh, Loki.

1332
01:49:07,080 --> 01:49:08,240
[SPEAKER_26]: It was pretty funky.

1333
01:49:08,260 --> 01:49:09,141
[SPEAKER_26]: I give it an 8.

1334
01:49:10,982 --> 01:49:11,302
[SPEAKER_26]: That's it?

1335
01:49:11,442 --> 01:49:11,782
[SPEAKER_26]: Funky?

1336
01:49:12,122 --> 01:49:11,782
8?

1337
01:49:12,522 --> 01:49:12,883
[SPEAKER_27]: That's it.

1338
01:49:13,043 --> 01:49:13,503
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright, Bradley.

1339
01:49:15,410 --> 01:49:16,692
[SPEAKER_24]: I like the gorillas.

1340
01:49:16,792 --> 01:49:22,538
[SPEAKER_24]: On one track it didn't really catch my attention very well.

1341
01:49:22,939 --> 01:49:24,401
[SPEAKER_24]: I'll give it a 7 for now.

1342
01:49:27,189 --> 01:49:27,590
[SPEAKER_27]: You know what?

1343
01:49:27,610 --> 01:49:28,690
[SPEAKER_27]: I actually really like that song.

1344
01:49:28,770 --> 01:49:35,952
[SPEAKER_27]: And if I think more of the Gorillaz music sounded like that, I'd probably be as much of a fan as Jamie is.

1345
01:49:36,032 --> 01:49:40,073
[SPEAKER_27]: So I kind of wish they'd do more of that sound.

1346
01:49:40,253 --> 01:49:44,334
[SPEAKER_27]: So I'm kind of excited that it's the next single because some of the remixes ought to be good.

1347
01:49:44,434 --> 01:49:45,854
[SPEAKER_27]: So I will give that song...

1348
01:49:48,275 --> 01:49:53,237
[SPEAKER_27]: At the same time, though, I'm starting to get a little burned out on gorillas and gorillas-related things in the cage match.

1349
01:49:53,337 --> 01:49:55,498
[SPEAKER_21]: So I really hope... I've been waiting for three months to put that together.

1350
01:49:55,578 --> 01:49:56,018
[SPEAKER_27]: I know.

1351
01:49:56,218 --> 01:49:57,379
[SPEAKER_21]: And by the way, it was Shawn Ryder.

1352
01:49:57,619 --> 01:50:01,440
[SPEAKER_27]: That's why I'm going to give it a bye, and I'm not going to dock at any point.

1353
01:50:01,741 --> 01:50:02,741
[SPEAKER_27]: So I'm going to go ahead and give it a nine.

1354
01:50:03,817 --> 01:50:09,842
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright, let's go ahead and recap, and then it'll be your turn to vote.

1355
01:50:10,022 --> 01:50:12,064
[SPEAKER_27]: So here it is, the three songs you can vote for tonight.

1356
01:50:12,124 --> 01:50:16,608
[SPEAKER_27]: Song number one, last week's winner, Darth Punk, Ted Koppel's Gin and Juice.

1357
01:50:17,068 --> 01:50:20,271
[SPEAKER_01]: Today confirms that the president is laid back.

1358
01:50:23,655 --> 01:50:26,898
[SPEAKER_27]: Song number two, DJ Tom Delsar, The Winner Takes It All, 2005.

1359
01:50:26,958 --> 01:50:35,207
[SPEAKER_18]: And song number three you can vote for tonight is Gorilla's Dare.

1360
01:50:49,961 --> 01:50:53,442
[SPEAKER_27]: All right, place vote now.

1361
01:50:53,582 --> 01:51:00,545
[SPEAKER_27]: Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote for song number one, song number two, or song number three.

1362
01:51:00,565 --> 01:51:04,326
[SPEAKER_27]: We'll tally them up and let you know who won.

1363
01:51:04,446 --> 01:51:05,707
[SPEAKER_27]: So send that private message in now.

1364
01:51:06,747 --> 01:51:07,687
[SPEAKER_27]: You don't have much time.

1365
01:51:08,328 --> 01:51:09,228
[SPEAKER_27]: No dilly-dallying.

1366
01:51:11,775 --> 01:51:12,255
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, Loki.

1367
01:51:13,056 --> 01:51:14,837
[SPEAKER_26]: I'd like to mention I did watch the video.

1368
01:51:16,618 --> 01:51:26,063
[SPEAKER_26]: It's of a new song called Manhole, and that's like, you know, manhole in street, not as in, you know, something else.

1369
01:51:26,923 --> 01:51:30,685
[SPEAKER_26]: Anyways, oh man, Food Mix 2 looks awesome.

1370
01:51:30,825 --> 01:51:40,230
[SPEAKER_26]: The interface is really cool, and the videos are just about as good as they were last time, so definitely one to try out once it comes out.

1371
01:51:41,192 --> 01:51:43,593
[SPEAKER_26]: But in the meantime, you'll just have to live vicariously through the video.

1372
01:51:43,653 --> 01:51:46,135
[SPEAKER_27]: The weird thing about that video, on what website can they get the video on?

1373
01:51:46,635 --> 01:52:08,788
[SPEAKER_26]: This is on, uh, it's http://foodmix.nothing.sh And there'll be a link on top there, it'll say, um... So that's foodmix.nothing.sh Yeah, that's shh, shh, shh, it.

1374
01:52:10,839 --> 01:52:11,419
[SPEAKER_26]: Exactly.

1375
01:52:12,320 --> 01:52:17,584
[SPEAKER_26]: And they basically have a 20 meg video you can download, plus five screen captures.

1376
01:52:18,464 --> 01:52:27,671
[SPEAKER_26]: And you can check out the brand new song, which is pretty good, but I didn't get to listen to it when it was playing because we had other music going at the same time.

1377
01:52:28,351 --> 01:52:30,493
[SPEAKER_26]: But it looks pretty cool.

1378
01:52:31,274 --> 01:52:31,894
[SPEAKER_26]: And go check it out.

1379
01:52:33,607 --> 01:52:40,972
[SPEAKER_27]: Now, what amazed me most about that video, the little bits that I saw kind of watching over your shoulder there, is that it appears that it has solo steps.

1380
01:52:41,832 --> 01:52:42,372
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, yeah.

1381
01:52:42,412 --> 01:52:45,414
[SPEAKER_27]: How many people actually take the time to create solo steps?

1382
01:52:47,696 --> 01:52:49,337
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, now you're playing it over there, huh?

1383
01:52:50,357 --> 01:52:56,381
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, I'm playing the music, but it's got this, like, little pig bunny thing running around the background, and it looks pretty cool.

1384
01:52:57,600 --> 01:52:59,521
[SPEAKER_26]: I really like the way Foon Mix is put together.

1385
01:52:59,561 --> 01:53:02,223
[SPEAKER_27]: I think it is one of the superior mixes.

1386
01:53:02,243 --> 01:53:07,467
[SPEAKER_27]: Of course, I haven't looked at a whole lot, but I think it is one of the better ones out there.

1387
01:53:10,329 --> 01:53:12,050
[SPEAKER_26]: This is a weird song too.

1388
01:53:12,070 --> 01:53:15,152
[SPEAKER_27]: Can you put the mic up to the speakers so they can hear a little bit of that?

1389
01:53:36,671 --> 01:53:37,151
[SPEAKER_27]: Interesting.

1390
01:53:37,892 --> 01:53:38,552
[SPEAKER_27]: A little funky.

1391
01:53:39,072 --> 01:53:39,953
[SPEAKER_27]: What's the name of that song?

1392
01:53:41,214 --> 01:53:41,774
[SPEAKER_27]: Manhole.

1393
01:53:42,114 --> 01:53:43,295
[SPEAKER_27]: That's just bizarre.

1394
01:53:43,315 --> 01:53:43,755
[SPEAKER_21]: Manhole.

1395
01:53:43,896 --> 01:53:44,916
[SPEAKER_21]: And look, it's a manhole.

1396
01:53:45,817 --> 01:53:49,479
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, there's a manhole, but what's great, though, is I'm going to fast forward it here into the end.

1397
01:53:50,600 --> 01:53:51,120
[SPEAKER_26]: Tee hee.

1398
01:53:52,041 --> 01:53:52,681
[SPEAKER_26]: Manhole.

1399
01:53:54,262 --> 01:53:55,503
[SPEAKER_26]: But they have a really cool thing.

1400
01:53:56,564 --> 01:53:58,165
[SPEAKER_26]: Like a little spinny flower thing, and then...

1401
01:54:01,098 --> 01:54:03,759
[SPEAKER_26]: And then they have like, they're just the backgrounds and stuff.

1402
01:54:03,779 --> 01:54:06,239
[SPEAKER_26]: They have a lot of animation going on the menus and stuff.

1403
01:54:06,259 --> 01:54:07,539
[SPEAKER_26]: And that's what's pretty cool about it.

1404
01:54:08,419 --> 01:54:09,080
[SPEAKER_26]: I think at least.

1405
01:54:11,120 --> 01:54:11,780
[SPEAKER_26]: It looks pretty cool.

1406
01:54:12,860 --> 01:54:14,501
[SPEAKER_26]: Anyways, so just go check it out.

1407
01:54:15,801 --> 01:54:18,941
[SPEAKER_27]: Alrighty, last call for cage match votes.

1408
01:54:19,202 --> 01:54:21,582
[SPEAKER_27]: Get those in right now or your vote won't count.

1409
01:54:22,082 --> 01:54:25,903
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't think we talked about this a whole lot last week.

1410
01:54:25,943 --> 01:54:26,503
[SPEAKER_27]: Pump it up.

1411
01:54:27,438 --> 01:54:29,500
[SPEAKER_27]: The brand new thing coming out there.

1412
01:54:29,600 --> 01:54:31,001
[SPEAKER_27]: Mad Catz is publishing it.

1413
01:54:31,602 --> 01:54:36,686
[SPEAKER_27]: A whole shitload of songs is going to be in the new release of Pump It Up coming out here in the U.S.

1414
01:54:37,047 --> 01:54:40,510
[SPEAKER_27]: Now, I know a lot of the DDR Freak people went and got to take a look at this.

1415
01:54:40,530 --> 01:54:41,991
[SPEAKER_27]: Did you go to DarkSakura?

1416
01:54:42,592 --> 01:54:42,852
[SPEAKER_21]: No.

1417
01:54:43,232 --> 01:54:43,352
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh.

1418
01:54:44,053 --> 01:54:45,154
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't care about Pump It Up.

1419
01:54:45,354 --> 01:54:45,494
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh.

1420
01:54:46,755 --> 01:54:49,058
[SPEAKER_27]: I would have gone just to check it out, but okay.

1421
01:54:50,639 --> 01:54:52,461
[SPEAKER_27]: But what about Run To You?

1422
01:54:53,932 --> 01:54:54,933
[SPEAKER_27]: It's not even in there.

1423
01:54:55,333 --> 01:55:00,075
[SPEAKER_27]: What's the point anymore?

1424
01:55:00,435 --> 01:55:05,377
[SPEAKER_21]: They've drained the lifeblood from Pump It Up in the form of Run To You.

1425
01:55:06,258 --> 01:55:08,299
[SPEAKER_21]: I recommend that for the next break, by the way.

1426
01:55:08,439 --> 01:55:10,540
[SPEAKER_27]: At least they have Beethoven's Virus.

1427
01:55:11,560 --> 01:55:17,203
[SPEAKER_21]: Beethoven's Virus is a really... People whore the shit out of that song, but it's still really good.

1428
01:55:17,363 --> 01:55:18,243
[SPEAKER_21]: It's kind of tough, too.

1429
01:55:18,323 --> 01:55:19,504
[SPEAKER_27]: And they do have Funky Tonight.

1430
01:55:20,307 --> 01:55:21,027
[SPEAKER_27]: So that's kind of cool.

1431
01:55:21,127 --> 01:55:23,028
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, but no DJ Doc.

1432
01:55:23,088 --> 01:55:24,369
[SPEAKER_27]: But this is what's really interesting.

1433
01:55:24,709 --> 01:55:26,890
[SPEAKER_27]: They actually put K-pop in a U.S.

1434
01:55:26,950 --> 01:55:27,310
[SPEAKER_27]: release.

1435
01:55:27,370 --> 01:55:28,271
[SPEAKER_27]: I think that's kind of neat.

1436
01:55:28,851 --> 01:55:30,032
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't know why, but I think that's neat.

1437
01:55:30,972 --> 01:55:34,034
[SPEAKER_27]: But of course, then again, if you look at DDR, they do have some J-pop songs.

1438
01:55:34,074 --> 01:55:37,515
[SPEAKER_27]: They don't bother translating, like, the B4U stuff, you know, which is kind of neat.

1439
01:55:37,755 --> 01:55:40,957
[SPEAKER_27]: Need to put in, like, you know, some more M-flow.

1440
01:55:42,758 --> 01:55:43,458
[SPEAKER_26]: You know, it's not K-pop.

1441
01:55:43,538 --> 01:55:44,439
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, this is really weird.

1442
01:55:44,519 --> 01:55:46,099
[SPEAKER_27]: And then they mix that with U.S.

1443
01:55:46,119 --> 01:55:46,179
[SPEAKER_27]: pop.

1444
01:55:48,047 --> 01:55:53,211
[SPEAKER_26]: Elvis, A Little Less Conversation Why does A Little Less Conversation have to be in every single music game?

1445
01:55:53,291 --> 01:55:53,611
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't know.

1446
01:55:53,892 --> 01:55:58,655
[SPEAKER_27]: Earth, Wind & Fire, Let's Groove, The Crystal Method, Name of the Game Okay, that's pretty awesome.

1447
01:56:00,577 --> 01:56:02,178
[SPEAKER_27]: Sugarhill Gang, Rapper's Delight

1448
01:56:03,146 --> 01:56:06,249
[SPEAKER_26]: I am glad that they have... That's actually pretty sweet right there.

1449
01:56:06,309 --> 01:56:07,770
[SPEAKER_27]: And then a bunch of other songs I've never heard of.

1450
01:56:08,371 --> 01:56:10,973
[SPEAKER_26]: They need to put Name of the Game in fucking DDR.

1451
01:56:11,553 --> 01:56:13,735
[SPEAKER_26]: Make like a hardcore DDR mix.

1452
01:56:13,795 --> 01:56:14,936
[SPEAKER_27]: Didn't they have Busy Child?

1453
01:56:14,976 --> 01:56:17,479
[SPEAKER_27]: Or what song was in Max 2?

1454
01:56:17,519 --> 01:56:18,199
[SPEAKER_27]: Was it Busy Child?

1455
01:56:18,540 --> 01:56:19,400
[SPEAKER_26]: It was Busy Child.

1456
01:56:19,480 --> 01:56:22,123
[SPEAKER_26]: But Name of the Game has, you know, the kick-ass...

1457
01:56:22,543 --> 01:56:23,384
[SPEAKER_26]: Name of the game.

1458
01:56:23,724 --> 01:56:25,665
[SPEAKER_26]: That song needs to be in Beatmania.

1459
01:56:25,685 --> 01:56:29,087
[SPEAKER_26]: If you want to put licensed songs in Beatmania, that song right there.

1460
01:56:29,107 --> 01:56:31,028
[SPEAKER_26]: Because it has tons of crazy scratching.

1461
01:56:31,048 --> 01:56:32,329
[SPEAKER_26]: And it would be perfect.

1462
01:56:33,270 --> 01:56:33,730
[SPEAKER_26]: Perfect.

1463
01:56:34,550 --> 01:56:34,831
[SPEAKER_26]: Alright.

1464
01:56:35,851 --> 01:56:37,452
[SPEAKER_27]: You kids want to hear who won tonight's Cage Match?

1465
01:56:37,933 --> 01:56:38,713
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, please.

1466
01:56:38,793 --> 01:56:39,494
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, let's.

1467
01:56:39,754 --> 01:56:41,195
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright.

1468
01:56:41,295 --> 01:56:45,297
[SPEAKER_27]: It was another one that came down to one freaking vote.

1469
01:56:46,198 --> 01:56:50,000
[SPEAKER_27]: So if you think your votes don't count, you're full of crap.

1470
01:56:51,513 --> 01:56:54,139
[SPEAKER_26]: Your votes count more than the US elections.

1471
01:56:56,223 --> 01:56:59,004
[SPEAKER_27]: Your votes count more than any of ours, too, remember.

1472
01:56:59,645 --> 01:57:05,767
[SPEAKER_27]: Because even though we rate the songs here, we go all Simon Cowell on them, they don't really count in the end.

1473
01:57:05,867 --> 01:57:06,807
[SPEAKER_27]: It's your votes that count.

1474
01:57:07,367 --> 01:57:13,810
[SPEAKER_27]: So the winning song by one vote... Oh, yes, I want to mention something real quick.

1475
01:57:13,970 --> 01:57:21,893
[SPEAKER_26]: Since you mentioned Simon Cowell, a brand new American Idol type thing that's going to be going on, but dancing this time.

1476
01:57:23,823 --> 01:57:24,464
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, hooray!

1477
01:57:24,524 --> 01:57:25,344
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm so excited.

1478
01:57:25,384 --> 01:57:27,706
[SPEAKER_27]: Do you think any DDR players will be in on that?

1479
01:57:27,987 --> 01:57:28,227
[SPEAKER_27]: Nope.

1480
01:57:28,327 --> 01:57:28,567
[SPEAKER_27]: No.

1481
01:57:29,107 --> 01:57:29,428
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright.

1482
01:57:29,548 --> 01:57:39,036
[SPEAKER_26]: I just thought I'd mention it because, you know, one, it delays finding out who won, and two, it sort of had, you know, you know, a little bit of... Can I get to the cage much longer now?

1483
01:57:39,136 --> 01:57:39,396
[SPEAKER_26]: I guess.

1484
01:57:42,939 --> 01:57:43,499
[SPEAKER_27]: Gorillas.

1485
01:57:43,880 --> 01:57:44,160
[SPEAKER_27]: Dare.

1486
01:57:48,784 --> 01:57:49,804
[SPEAKER_21]: I love you, chat room.

1487
01:57:50,205 --> 01:57:51,565
[SPEAKER_27]: One vote over the ABBA cover.

1488
01:57:51,885 --> 01:57:52,665
[SPEAKER_21]: I love you, chat room.

1489
01:57:52,905 --> 01:57:53,586
[SPEAKER_21]: Hey, good.

1490
01:57:53,626 --> 01:57:56,207
[SPEAKER_21]: People had the good taste not to vote for Ted Koppel.

1491
01:57:56,247 --> 01:57:57,007
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, Ted Koppel.

1492
01:57:57,167 --> 01:58:00,688
[SPEAKER_27]: And then on the other side of that, the Ted Koppel song got one vote.

1493
01:58:01,308 --> 01:58:02,109
[SPEAKER_21]: I wonder who voted.

1494
01:58:03,549 --> 01:58:06,650
[SPEAKER_21]: We need to find that person and beat them upside the head with a wet roll of newspaper.

1495
01:58:07,730 --> 01:58:15,613
[SPEAKER_27]: They actually said in their vote, and I already closed the window so I forget who did it, but they actually said in their vote, I'm voting for it because nobody else is going to.

1496
01:58:16,694 --> 01:58:17,494
[SPEAKER_21]: How prophetic.

1497
01:58:18,843 --> 01:58:20,824
[SPEAKER_21]: We have ourselves a psychic in here.

1498
01:58:22,726 --> 01:58:23,066
[SPEAKER_27]: All right.

1499
01:58:25,167 --> 01:58:25,448
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay.

1500
01:58:28,650 --> 01:58:29,710
[SPEAKER_27]: I am happy.

1501
01:58:29,851 --> 01:58:38,196
[SPEAKER_27]: I am pleased as punch, to quote an old expression from the 50s, I am pleased as punch that gin and juice is out of there now.

1502
01:58:39,617 --> 01:58:44,501
[SPEAKER_21]: and the heavens parted and the choir of angels came forth and said, woohoo!

1503
01:58:44,561 --> 01:58:46,823
[SPEAKER_27]: Loki, don't you ever do that again.

1504
01:58:47,523 --> 01:58:48,144
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, don't worry.

1505
01:58:48,384 --> 01:58:49,325
[SPEAKER_26]: It's coming back.

1506
01:58:49,545 --> 01:58:50,906
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll stick the puppy dogs on you.

1507
01:58:51,166 --> 01:58:54,709
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, we'll make a remix of that in Girls or something, you know.

1508
01:58:54,909 --> 01:58:55,529
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, Christ.

1509
01:58:58,112 --> 01:59:00,155
[SPEAKER_26]: No, anyways, speaking of remixes.

1510
01:59:01,376 --> 01:59:02,778
[SPEAKER_26]: Let's go to a break, boys and girls.

1511
01:59:03,119 --> 01:59:03,880
[SPEAKER_27]: Let's play my song!

1512
01:59:03,960 --> 01:59:05,822
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, let's play, what song am I gonna play?

1513
01:59:05,842 --> 01:59:08,886
[SPEAKER_27]: I was gonna do the dancing stage stuff, but we can do your song.

1514
01:59:08,907 --> 01:59:10,829
[SPEAKER_26]: You can play the dancing stage stuff then, that's fine.

1515
01:59:10,869 --> 01:59:14,093
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright, what song, oh, all of these on here that I haven't...

1516
01:59:15,077 --> 01:59:15,618
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, wow.

1517
01:59:15,898 --> 01:59:17,279
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, so we got this Blondie song.

1518
01:59:17,359 --> 01:59:19,280
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, here, here, I'll pick some good ones out for you.

1519
01:59:19,480 --> 01:59:19,921
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, please do.

1520
01:59:20,001 --> 01:59:23,343
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, let's do... Is this the, oh, is this that song that I think it is?

1521
01:59:23,624 --> 01:59:23,964
[SPEAKER_26]: It is.

1522
01:59:23,984 --> 01:59:24,484
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes, I want that one.

1523
01:59:24,524 --> 01:59:27,026
[SPEAKER_26]: Except there's no, not really many lyrics in that.

1524
01:59:27,387 --> 01:59:29,888
[SPEAKER_26]: And then, um, Get It On.

1525
01:59:29,908 --> 01:59:30,529
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay.

1526
01:59:30,549 --> 01:59:31,029
[SPEAKER_26]: That'd be good.

1527
01:59:31,950 --> 01:59:34,132
[SPEAKER_27]: And... So we're gonna play I See You Baby, Get It On.

1528
01:59:34,332 --> 01:59:36,594
[SPEAKER_26]: And maybe, um, Some Girls Are Supergirl.

1529
01:59:36,614 --> 01:59:37,494
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, that's supergirl.

1530
01:59:37,534 --> 01:59:39,676
[SPEAKER_27]: And then we'll do four, so alright as well?

1531
01:59:40,417 --> 01:59:42,138
[SPEAKER_26]: Um, oh, oh, oh, um, actually Circles.

1532
01:59:42,918 --> 01:59:45,879
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, so we're going to hear music, and what's the name of this game again?

1533
01:59:46,199 --> 01:59:50,060
[SPEAKER_26]: Dancing Stage Unleashed 2, it's your European version of Ultramix 2.

1534
01:59:50,520 --> 01:59:51,820
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, very cool, very good.

1535
01:59:52,481 --> 02:00:04,424
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright, here it is, started off with I See You Baby, and then we're going to get into Get It On, that sounds hot, Some Girls, and Circles, so this is the Europe version of Ultramix 2.

1536
02:00:04,704 --> 02:00:08,925
[SPEAKER_27]: So let's see if it is yet another release over there that has better songs than us.

1537
02:00:09,385 --> 02:00:09,745
[SPEAKER_27]: We'll see.

1538
02:00:09,785 --> 02:00:10,165
[SPEAKER_27]: Probably.

1539
02:00:10,345 --> 02:00:11,066
[SPEAKER_27]: We'll see, here we go.

1540
02:00:11,406 --> 02:00:12,186
[SPEAKER_27]: We'll be back after this.

1541
02:00:13,410 --> 02:00:14,713
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the house that Funk builds.

1542
02:00:15,374 --> 02:00:16,596

[SPEAKER_18]: This is the How That Funk Feels, group of my style.

02:07:55,426 --> 02:07:56,767
[SPEAKER_25]: Orange Lounge Radio.

1561

[SPEAKER_25]: Packed Guns.

[SPEAKER_27]: We're back, boys and girls.

1563
02:08:02,206 --> 02:08:02,826
[SPEAKER_27]: So what do you think?

1564
02:08:02,866 --> 02:08:06,948
[SPEAKER_27]: Did the Brits get better on the Xbox second mix?

1565
02:08:07,528 --> 02:08:08,288
[SPEAKER_21]: Sounds a lot better.

1566
02:08:09,008 --> 02:08:09,909
[SPEAKER_21]: They got some fun stuff.

1567
02:08:10,869 --> 02:08:11,229
[SPEAKER_27]: You know what?

1568
02:08:11,529 --> 02:08:14,310
[SPEAKER_27]: I agree that they have some fun stuff, but I don't think they have it any better.

1569
02:08:14,711 --> 02:08:16,111
[SPEAKER_27]: I just think it's the same.

1570
02:08:16,251 --> 02:08:20,773
[SPEAKER_21]: I prefer that to... I'm not going to say it because I'm nice.

1571
02:08:23,614 --> 02:08:23,894
[SPEAKER_27]: Loki?

1572
02:08:25,155 --> 02:08:25,575
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't know.

1573
02:08:26,797 --> 02:08:30,760
[SPEAKER_26]: I like some of their club music, but I don't like the Blondie.

1574
02:08:31,200 --> 02:08:32,761
[SPEAKER_26]: Blondie can stay far away.

1575
02:08:33,161 --> 02:08:34,362
[SPEAKER_15]: Blondie's cool.

1576
02:08:34,502 --> 02:08:36,903
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, Blondie's cool in the 80s.

1577
02:08:37,464 --> 02:08:38,544
[SPEAKER_26]: Blondie's not cool now.

1578
02:08:40,285 --> 02:08:40,886
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't know.

1579
02:08:41,846 --> 02:08:45,789
[SPEAKER_27]: Remember Maria from the late 90s when they reunited?

1580
02:08:46,429 --> 02:08:47,290
[SPEAKER_17]: Maria!

1581
02:08:47,370 --> 02:08:49,231
[SPEAKER_21]: That was a neat video.

1582
02:08:52,434 --> 02:08:57,236
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know, I actually do think the top of Blondie's popularity was about Rapture.

1583
02:08:58,057 --> 02:08:59,157
[SPEAKER_21]: Rapture.

1584
02:09:02,258 --> 02:09:04,619
[SPEAKER_21]: That's a little stupid rap about the aliens.

1585
02:09:05,459 --> 02:09:11,362
[SPEAKER_27]: Do you know that Rapture was like the first rap song or whatever to top the billboard or something like that?

1586
02:09:11,722 --> 02:09:13,943
[SPEAKER_21]: It like was a pop song that had rap in it.

1587
02:09:14,043 --> 02:09:17,844
[SPEAKER_27]: I know, but they say it was the first rap song to ever top the charts.

1588
02:09:17,984 --> 02:09:20,205
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm like, dude, when I think of rap,

1589
02:09:20,575 --> 02:09:21,516
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't think a Debra Harry.

1590
02:09:23,056 --> 02:09:24,537
[SPEAKER_27]: It's all about Grandmaster Flash.

1591
02:09:24,697 --> 02:09:25,598
[SPEAKER_21]: I think a Tupac.

1592
02:09:27,799 --> 02:09:28,820
[SPEAKER_21]: No, no, no, no.

1593
02:09:28,860 --> 02:09:29,960
[SPEAKER_21]: You need to go older.

1594
02:09:31,081 --> 02:09:35,123
[SPEAKER_21]: It's all about the message.

1595
02:09:36,524 --> 02:09:39,326
[SPEAKER_27]: How about Flava Flav when he used to wear the huge clock around his neck?

1596
02:09:39,966 --> 02:09:43,148
[SPEAKER_21]: I had some Public Enemy in the pre-show.

1597
02:09:43,228 --> 02:09:43,648
[SPEAKER_27]: I know, I know.

1598
02:09:43,768 --> 02:09:44,749
[SPEAKER_21]: I put 911 as a joke in there.

1599
02:09:44,789 --> 02:09:45,650
[SPEAKER_21]: Flava Flav!

1600
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:51,746
[SPEAKER_21]: Then he started hanging out with Brigitte Nielsen, who wondered about the house naked.

1601
02:09:52,347 --> 02:09:54,389
[SPEAKER_27]: That was my Flava Flav impersonation, by the way.

1602
02:09:54,409 --> 02:09:55,370
[SPEAKER_21]: Flava Flav!

1603
02:09:56,071 --> 02:09:59,035
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, I'm going to go hide behind the chair now.

1604
02:09:59,435 --> 02:10:01,418
[SPEAKER_27]: Come on, tell me that's not a good impression.

1605
02:10:02,674 --> 02:10:03,674
[SPEAKER_17]: FLAVOR FLAVE!

1606
02:10:19,269 --> 02:10:20,530
[SPEAKER_26]: What's the first two?

1607
02:10:20,770 --> 02:10:21,611
[SPEAKER_26]: That's a good question.

1608
02:10:24,054 --> 02:10:26,676
[SPEAKER_26]: In what sense that's used on web portals?

1609
02:10:26,976 --> 02:10:31,220
[SPEAKER_26]: Ginormous was number one and Confuzzled was number two.

1610
02:10:31,541 --> 02:10:32,502
[SPEAKER_26]: Me so Confuzzled.

1611
02:10:33,122 --> 02:10:34,543
[SPEAKER_26]: Followed by Chillax.

1612
02:10:34,644 --> 02:10:35,865
[SPEAKER_26]: What the hell did they scan?

1613
02:10:35,885 --> 02:10:37,386
[SPEAKER_26]: I've never heard that one.

1614
02:10:37,586 --> 02:10:39,928
[SPEAKER_26]: Chillax, which means chill out slash relax.

1615
02:10:40,694 --> 02:10:41,734
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm going to go chillax.

1616
02:10:42,134 --> 02:10:43,195
[SPEAKER_21]: Never heard it.

1617
02:10:43,615 --> 02:10:45,015
[SPEAKER_26]: Cognitive dysplasia.

1618
02:10:45,195 --> 02:10:46,996
[SPEAKER_26]: Where the hell did they get these words?

1619
02:10:47,036 --> 02:10:49,156
[SPEAKER_26]: Did they scan people's live journals or something?

1620
02:10:49,176 --> 02:10:50,116
[SPEAKER_26]: No, it was a contest.

1621
02:10:50,136 --> 02:10:51,337
[SPEAKER_26]: DDR freak!

1622
02:10:53,257 --> 02:11:00,199
[SPEAKER_26]: Cognitive dysplasia was the feeling that you have before you even leave the house that you're going to forget something about...

1623
02:11:00,879 --> 02:11:01,259
[SPEAKER_27]: You're right.

1624
02:11:01,299 --> 02:11:03,440
[SPEAKER_27]: That's a total DDR freak post.

1625
02:11:04,100 --> 02:11:06,141
[SPEAKER_27]: Cosmic is actually a word.

1626
02:11:06,401 --> 02:11:11,062
[SPEAKER_27]: Can someone explain for me why they won't put Japanese songs on American DDR?

1627
02:11:11,082 --> 02:11:11,862
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm so confuzzled.

1628
02:11:12,782 --> 02:11:13,303
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't know.

1629
02:11:13,343 --> 02:11:14,983
[SPEAKER_26]: Then they have... OMG reads back.

1630
02:11:15,103 --> 02:11:16,864
[SPEAKER_26]: Followed by number six is gription.

1631
02:11:17,864 --> 02:11:19,464
[SPEAKER_26]: You know, my tires need gription.

1632
02:11:21,025 --> 02:11:26,767
[SPEAKER_26]: Phonecrastinate means putting off answering the phone until it displays on caller ID.

1633
02:11:27,487 --> 02:11:28,047
[SPEAKER_26]: Slickery.

1634
02:11:28,647 --> 02:11:42,230
[SPEAKER_26]: Having a surface that is wet or icy, Snert, snow that is dirty, and Linguini, a person incapable of producing neoglyisms or something.

1635
02:11:42,470 --> 02:11:42,970
[SPEAKER_26]: Alright, who cares?

1636
02:11:42,990 --> 02:11:43,531
[SPEAKER_21]: Whatever the hell it is.

1637
02:11:43,591 --> 02:11:44,151
[SPEAKER_21]: You know what?

1638
02:11:44,391 --> 02:11:46,231
[SPEAKER_27]: That was stupid.

1639
02:11:47,051 --> 02:11:48,652
[SPEAKER_27]: Skype line's open, boys and girls.

1640
02:11:48,952 --> 02:11:50,692
[SPEAKER_27]: Call us, www.orangellinger.com.

1641
02:11:50,712 --> 02:11:51,613
[SPEAKER_27]: Click on Interact With Us.

1642
02:11:53,513 --> 02:11:57,354
[SPEAKER_27]: If you're really confuzzled at everything that's going on... You have cognitive dysplasia.

1643
02:11:58,502 --> 02:12:01,183
[SPEAKER_26]: I like that, um, you know, those two words there.

1644
02:12:03,605 --> 02:12:14,390
[SPEAKER_27]: And if you've ever tried to eat and snert, if you've ever tried to eat snirty, if you've ever tried to eat yellow snirty, we want to hear from you.

1645
02:12:16,591 --> 02:12:17,632
[SPEAKER_26]: Snert's not a fucking word.

1646
02:12:17,672 --> 02:12:18,973
[SPEAKER_26]: Who the hell comes up with this stuff?

1647
02:12:19,313 --> 02:12:21,914
[SPEAKER_26]: I've never heard anyone use the word snert ever.

1648
02:12:22,574 --> 02:12:22,955
[SPEAKER_27]: Ever.

1649
02:12:23,975 --> 02:12:24,495
[SPEAKER_27]: Ever.

1650
02:12:24,515 --> 02:12:26,196
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright, be quiet, we got a call.

1651
02:12:26,236 --> 02:12:27,297
[SPEAKER_27]: Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.

1652
02:12:27,816 --> 02:12:28,136
[SPEAKER_27]: Hey.

1653
02:12:28,736 --> 02:12:29,256
[SPEAKER_27]: Hey, what's up?

1654
02:12:29,276 --> 02:12:29,636
[SPEAKER_27]: Who's this?

1655
02:12:29,877 --> 02:12:31,197
[SPEAKER_09]: It's BlackDevilRx.

1656
02:12:31,317 --> 02:12:32,357
[SPEAKER_27]: Hello, BlackDevilRx.

1657
02:12:32,377 --> 02:12:33,037
[SPEAKER_27]: What's on your mind?

1658
02:12:34,338 --> 02:12:38,259
[SPEAKER_09]: Confuzzled should be stricken from the English language forever.

1659
02:12:39,179 --> 02:12:41,039
[SPEAKER_27]: You know, I tend to agree.

1660
02:12:41,059 --> 02:12:42,640
[SPEAKER_27]: Confuzzled is kind of a weird word.

1661
02:12:43,340 --> 02:12:47,161
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm trying to think of other things I see in blogs way too much that ought to be banned.

1662
02:12:48,201 --> 02:12:48,561
[SPEAKER_09]: Like what?

1663
02:12:49,301 --> 02:12:49,801
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't know.

1664
02:12:49,921 --> 02:12:55,763
[SPEAKER_27]: How about just... How about overusage of exclamation points?

1665
02:12:55,903 --> 02:12:56,243
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't know.

1666
02:12:56,283 --> 02:12:56,383
[SPEAKER_27]: Hmm.

1667
02:12:58,322 --> 02:13:01,303
[SPEAKER_27]: How about LeetSpeak?

1668
02:13:01,383 --> 02:13:02,083
[SPEAKER_27]: I want the number 3.

1669
02:13:02,823 --> 02:13:04,623
[SPEAKER_27]: Just the number 3 to be banned.

1670
02:13:06,484 --> 02:13:09,684
[SPEAKER_27]: We'll go around and break everybody's 3 keys so they can't type Leet.

1671
02:13:09,784 --> 02:13:11,464
[SPEAKER_27]: They can't use LeetSpeak at all.

1672
02:13:11,564 --> 02:13:12,545
[SPEAKER_27]: They'll just do 2 plus 1.

1673
02:13:15,025 --> 02:13:16,545
[SPEAKER_27]: Anything on your mind gaming-wise?

1674
02:13:17,786 --> 02:13:18,326
[SPEAKER_09]: No, not much.

1675
02:13:18,806 --> 02:13:20,586
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm kind of waiting for UM3 to come out.

1676
02:13:21,046 --> 02:13:22,066
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh yeah, Ultramix 3?

1677
02:13:22,146 --> 02:13:23,507
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1678
02:13:23,527 --> 02:13:25,247
[SPEAKER_27]: What did you think of the Midihead song we played earlier?

1679
02:13:25,703 --> 02:13:26,504
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, it was awesome.

1680
02:13:26,624 --> 02:13:27,586
[SPEAKER_09]: I love Middyhead so much.

1681
02:13:27,886 --> 02:13:29,368
[SPEAKER_27]: He's good stuff.

1682
02:13:29,489 --> 02:13:30,190
[SPEAKER_27]: Good stuff.

1683
02:13:30,410 --> 02:13:31,031
[SPEAKER_09]: Black Devil Rex.

1684
02:13:31,531 --> 02:13:32,453
[SPEAKER_21]: Ooh, hi.

1685
02:13:33,314 --> 02:13:33,614
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello.

1686
02:13:33,735 --> 02:13:40,084
[SPEAKER_21]: So how can you tolerate the not staying on key, sounding like a gargled gravel?

1687
02:13:40,104 --> 02:13:40,144
[SPEAKER_21]: Um...

1688
02:13:41,966 --> 02:13:45,427
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, I don't know, it's probably this mic system I have, it's really old.

1689
02:13:45,968 --> 02:13:47,688
[SPEAKER_27]: No, no, she's not talking about you.

1690
02:13:47,908 --> 02:13:49,949
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm talking about me.

1691
02:13:50,829 --> 02:13:51,069
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay.

1692
02:13:51,590 --> 02:13:52,730
[SPEAKER_27]: Kind of misunderstood there.

1693
02:13:52,790 --> 02:13:57,412
[SPEAKER_27]: I realize DarkSakura can be pretty blunt with people, but she does have tact.

1694
02:13:58,512 --> 02:13:59,833
[SPEAKER_27]: Your voice sounds like crap.

1695
02:14:00,673 --> 02:14:02,014
[SPEAKER_21]: No, I'm not that bad.

1696
02:14:04,582 --> 02:14:04,963
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know.

1697
02:14:05,803 --> 02:14:06,905
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm gonna be nice.

1698
02:14:07,105 --> 02:14:08,466
[SPEAKER_26]: She's making fun of Midi Head.

1699
02:14:08,827 --> 02:14:09,127
[SPEAKER_21]: Nice.

1700
02:14:09,427 --> 02:14:11,910
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm not making fun of him, I just don't think he can sing very well.

1701
02:14:13,049 --> 02:14:14,269
[SPEAKER_21]: He should get somebody who can sing.

1702
02:14:14,289 --> 02:14:17,450
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, he sold records and CDs, and he makes money.

1703
02:14:17,470 --> 02:14:19,230
[SPEAKER_21]: It's always Paul and Terry, but what's her excuse?

1704
02:14:19,710 --> 02:14:21,711
[SPEAKER_09]: You gotta go out and buy a MIDI head CD.

1705
02:14:21,731 --> 02:14:26,791
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, people still buy, you know, crap like Britney Spears, and she can't sing either.

1706
02:14:27,031 --> 02:14:27,692
[SPEAKER_27]: Touché.

1707
02:14:28,012 --> 02:14:31,832
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, worse than that, people watch that freaking show on UPN.

1708
02:14:32,332 --> 02:14:34,713
[SPEAKER_27]: What is it, Britney and... No, no, no, wait, wait, wait, stop, stop, what?

1709
02:14:34,773 --> 02:14:35,893
[SPEAKER_26]: Nobody watches UPN.

1710
02:14:37,193 --> 02:14:37,413
[SPEAKER_27]: Ever.

1711
02:14:37,473 --> 02:14:38,233
[SPEAKER_27]: Wrestling's on?

1712
02:14:38,253 --> 02:14:39,033
[SPEAKER_27]: Uh-uh, uh-uh.

1713
02:14:39,314 --> 02:14:41,634
[SPEAKER_27]: I watch Girlfriends every Monday night, okay?

1714
02:14:43,246 --> 02:14:44,067
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm just kidding, I don't.

1715
02:14:44,747 --> 02:14:45,768
[SPEAKER_27]: But I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

1716
02:14:45,788 --> 02:14:47,409
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh my god, I just watched the WB.

1717
02:14:47,429 --> 02:14:49,671
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh god.

1718
02:14:50,892 --> 02:14:54,134
[SPEAKER_27]: Excuse me, weren't you a Buffy fan, if I recall?

1719
02:14:54,594 --> 02:14:58,357
[SPEAKER_21]: I like Buffy, and I only watched UPN because Buffy went to UPN.

1720
02:14:58,917 --> 02:14:59,898
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't like Angel.

1721
02:15:02,100 --> 02:15:02,820
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't like Angel.

1722
02:15:02,940 --> 02:15:03,781
[SPEAKER_21]: Angel's a whiny bitch.

1723
02:15:05,142 --> 02:15:07,884
[SPEAKER_27]: Anyway, before we got there on TV chat, what was that?

1724
02:15:07,944 --> 02:15:09,125
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh yeah, the Britney thing.

1725
02:15:09,225 --> 02:15:10,866
[SPEAKER_27]: Apparently on this show, what?

1726
02:15:12,489 --> 02:15:12,849
[SPEAKER_27]: Nothing?

1727
02:15:13,330 --> 02:15:14,511
[SPEAKER_27]: I thought we were talking about MidiHead.

1728
02:15:14,931 --> 02:15:16,052
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm just laughing at what she said.

1729
02:15:16,612 --> 02:15:18,814
[SPEAKER_08]: How did we get from MidiHead to UPN?

1730
02:15:19,174 --> 02:15:21,116
[SPEAKER_27]: Hold on, I'm not done talking about Britney Spears yet.

1731
02:15:21,496 --> 02:15:26,560
[SPEAKER_27]: Britney Spears, apparently on her show, reveals herself to be a total nymphomaniac.

1732
02:15:26,841 --> 02:15:28,482
[SPEAKER_27]: Like she always talks about sex.

1733
02:15:28,802 --> 02:15:30,824
[SPEAKER_26]: That would be hot if she wasn't pregnant.

1734
02:15:33,487 --> 02:15:37,889
[SPEAKER_26]: But since she's pregnant and fat and nasty... And she's smoking too, right?

1735
02:15:38,330 --> 02:15:39,390
[SPEAKER_21]: She's a fucking baby killer.

1736
02:15:39,410 --> 02:15:42,592
[SPEAKER_27]: And that would also be original if Madonna hadn't done it 15 years ago.

1737
02:15:42,612 --> 02:15:44,173
[SPEAKER_26]: You can't have a baby genius.

1738
02:15:44,373 --> 02:15:47,915
[SPEAKER_26]: The baby needs to grow up to be a pop star, so she has to smoke at an early age.

1739
02:15:47,935 --> 02:15:49,396
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, her little sister's giving it a go.

1740
02:15:50,056 --> 02:15:52,017
[SPEAKER_21]: I have a friend who went to high school with Britney Spears.

1741
02:15:52,697 --> 02:15:53,218
[SPEAKER_21]: In New Orleans.

1742
02:15:53,458 --> 02:15:53,858
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm sorry.

1743
02:15:54,278 --> 02:15:54,658
[SPEAKER_21]: So was he.

1744
02:15:56,239 --> 02:15:56,619
[SPEAKER_27]: Anyway.

1745
02:15:57,460 --> 02:15:58,641
[SPEAKER_27]: Hi, Black Devil Rex.

1746
02:15:58,661 --> 02:16:00,181
[SPEAKER_27]: You called to talk about games?

1747
02:16:00,281 --> 02:16:00,982
[SPEAKER_27]: Still here.

1748
02:16:02,441 --> 02:16:04,824
[SPEAKER_27]: This is what we do to our callers, don't worry about it.

1749
02:16:11,093 --> 02:16:16,781
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, so hopefully no Britney on Ultramix 3, although the Extreme 2 kids are getting some Britney, but it's going to be covered.

1750
02:16:17,302 --> 02:16:17,963
[SPEAKER_27]: Huh?

1751
02:16:18,564 --> 02:16:19,345
[SPEAKER_09]: People got angry.

1752
02:16:20,346 --> 02:16:21,087
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my god!

1753
02:16:21,448 --> 02:16:22,469
[SPEAKER_09]: Oops, I did it again!

1754
02:16:39,842 --> 02:16:40,302
[SPEAKER_27]: and Ninja Rep.

1755
02:17:07,970 --> 02:17:08,651
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, Ninja Rap.

1756
02:17:08,971 --> 02:17:09,452
[SPEAKER_21]: It's up there.

1757
02:17:10,353 --> 02:17:12,135
[SPEAKER_27]: It's up there in the big pile of suck.

1758
02:17:12,356 --> 02:17:14,158
[SPEAKER_27]: Go Ninja, Go Ninja, Go.

1759
02:17:14,538 --> 02:17:17,762
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, and you know what rhymes with Go Ninja, Go Ninja, Go?

1760
02:17:18,243 --> 02:17:20,125
[SPEAKER_27]: Konami, Konami, Yo.

1761
02:17:21,728 --> 02:17:23,109
[SPEAKER_27]: I know, that's what I was thinking.

1762
02:17:23,129 --> 02:17:27,711
[SPEAKER_27]: I swear to God, at E3, the announcer guy would be, Konami, Konami, yo!

1763
02:17:27,991 --> 02:17:32,394
[SPEAKER_07]: And then they'd all of us going, I was just moving my mouth going, this sucks, this sucks, yo.

1764
02:17:33,134 --> 02:17:36,056
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was thinking, go ninja, go ninja, go!

1765
02:17:36,116 --> 02:17:38,177
[SPEAKER_26]: I just said, ninja, ninja rap.

1766
02:17:45,475 --> 02:17:47,636
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you for depressing us, BlackDevilRx, with your phone call.

1767
02:17:47,656 --> 02:17:48,256
[SPEAKER_21]: You're welcome.

1768
02:17:48,456 --> 02:17:49,576
[SPEAKER_18]: You are so welcome.

1769
02:17:50,637 --> 02:17:52,957
[SPEAKER_21]: We like some distraction here.

1770
02:17:53,258 --> 02:17:54,958
[SPEAKER_27]: You're getting us in the mood for the goth club.

1771
02:17:55,158 --> 02:17:59,860
[SPEAKER_21]: Digression is our middle, no, lounge is our middle name.

1772
02:18:00,080 --> 02:18:05,001
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm going to wear all black, and I'm going to listen to depressing music.

1773
02:18:05,201 --> 02:18:09,263
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm Osriel, the Prince of Sorrow.

1774
02:18:09,283 --> 02:18:13,044
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, the joke is about an hour and a half ago.

1775
02:18:14,204 --> 02:18:15,505
[SPEAKER_21]: Goth Talk still cracks me up.

1776
02:18:16,325 --> 02:18:18,286
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm on joke Hawaiian time.

1777
02:18:18,326 --> 02:18:19,547
[SPEAKER_26]: Hey, our caller's trying to speak.

1778
02:18:19,587 --> 02:18:20,067
[SPEAKER_26]: Let him speak.

1779
02:18:20,527 --> 02:18:21,348
[SPEAKER_21]: No, no, no, no, no.

1780
02:18:21,388 --> 02:18:22,188
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just, no.

1781
02:18:22,608 --> 02:18:23,048
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm finished.

1782
02:18:23,869 --> 02:18:24,729
[SPEAKER_21]: You don't want to speak?

1783
02:18:25,069 --> 02:18:26,610
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, you could sing or something.

1784
02:18:26,630 --> 02:18:27,110
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know.

1785
02:18:28,451 --> 02:18:28,711
[SPEAKER_09]: Sing.

1786
02:18:28,831 --> 02:18:29,652
[SPEAKER_21]: Serenade us!

1787
02:18:30,912 --> 02:18:31,492
[SPEAKER_21]: I command.

1788
02:18:31,512 --> 02:18:32,853
[SPEAKER_09]: He's making fun of goth people.

1789
02:18:33,914 --> 02:18:35,134
[SPEAKER_27]: I can't hear him.

1790
02:18:35,254 --> 02:18:36,575
[SPEAKER_27]: He's saying keep making fun of goth people.

1791
02:18:36,595 --> 02:18:37,675
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, you're getting quiet all of a sudden.

1792
02:18:37,695 --> 02:18:39,296
[SPEAKER_21]: We're not making fun of goth people.

1793
02:18:39,316 --> 02:18:41,417
[SPEAKER_21]: We're making fun of people who make fun of goth people.

1794
02:18:42,238 --> 02:18:42,578
[SPEAKER_21]: Like you.

1795
02:18:44,460 --> 02:18:45,661
[SPEAKER_27]: Wow, that was nice.

1796
02:18:46,281 --> 02:18:46,542
[SPEAKER_21]: Hi.

1797
02:18:47,122 --> 02:18:47,542
[SPEAKER_27]: All right.

1798
02:18:47,862 --> 02:18:50,124
[SPEAKER_27]: We're going to let you go before DarkSakura says something really mean.

1799
02:18:50,144 --> 02:18:52,145
[SPEAKER_27]: Honestly, we're not having an Asian drink.

1800
02:18:52,746 --> 02:18:53,366
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm not being mean.

1801
02:18:53,386 --> 02:18:54,007
[SPEAKER_21]: Am I being mean?

1802
02:18:54,687 --> 02:18:54,867
[SPEAKER_21]: No.

1803
02:18:55,388 --> 02:18:55,648
[SPEAKER_21]: See?

1804
02:18:56,188 --> 02:18:56,529
[SPEAKER_27]: All right.

1805
02:18:56,589 --> 02:18:57,429
[SPEAKER_21]: You got served.

1806
02:19:00,151 --> 02:19:02,313
[SPEAKER_26]: Wow, that joke was like a couple years ago.

1807
02:19:02,913 --> 02:19:03,754
[SPEAKER_09]: I know it was great.

1808
02:19:04,294 --> 02:19:06,015
[SPEAKER_27]: All right, BlackDevilRx, you're bringing the show down.

1809
02:19:06,055 --> 02:19:06,596
[SPEAKER_27]: I need to let you go.

1810
02:19:07,156 --> 02:19:07,736
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, fine.

1811
02:19:07,897 --> 02:19:08,337
[SPEAKER_27]: No, I'm kidding.

1812
02:19:08,357 --> 02:19:09,998
[SPEAKER_27]: What do you want to say?

1813
02:19:11,459 --> 02:19:13,000
[SPEAKER_09]: Go beat Mania U.S.

1814
02:19:15,071 --> 02:19:15,891
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, I agree.

1815
02:19:15,951 --> 02:19:17,532
[SPEAKER_27]: Go Beatmania US.

1816
02:19:18,652 --> 02:19:21,893
[SPEAKER_27]: Go right on the store shelves and into my house as soon as possible.

1817
02:19:23,673 --> 02:19:24,433
[SPEAKER_27]: Shut up, Jamie.

1818
02:19:25,374 --> 02:19:25,754
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright.

1819
02:19:29,395 --> 02:19:30,695
[SPEAKER_27]: Have a good one, BlackDevilRx.

1820
02:19:30,715 --> 02:19:31,575
[SPEAKER_27]: We'll talk to you later, alright?

1821
02:19:31,595 --> 02:19:32,115
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, I will.

1822
02:19:32,275 --> 02:19:32,535
[SPEAKER_09]: Later.

1823
02:19:32,856 --> 02:19:33,116
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye.

1824
02:19:33,156 --> 02:19:33,376
[SPEAKER_27]: Bye.

1825
02:19:35,916 --> 02:19:42,098
[SPEAKER_27]: I bet it's got to be really amusing to be somebody calling into this show and just really not knowing what you're in for when you come and speak to us.

1826
02:19:47,316 --> 02:19:48,177
[SPEAKER_28]: Let's go to another call.

1827
02:19:48,297 --> 02:19:51,559
[SPEAKER_26]: This is like one of those times that we need a random call from, like, Travis.

1828
02:19:51,599 --> 02:19:52,259
[SPEAKER_26]: Hold on, hold on.

1829
02:19:52,719 --> 02:19:53,680
[SPEAKER_27]: Travis, call us!

1830
02:19:53,800 --> 02:19:55,621
[SPEAKER_27]: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle Fan Club, you're on the air.

1831
02:19:56,901 --> 02:19:58,062
[SPEAKER_27]: Hey, Sky, Siggy here.

1832
02:19:58,222 --> 02:19:58,762
[SPEAKER_27]: Hey, what's up?

1833
02:20:00,103 --> 02:20:00,863
[SPEAKER_25]: Go, Siggy!

1834
02:20:00,883 --> 02:20:01,624
[SPEAKER_25]: Go, Siggy!

1835
02:20:01,684 --> 02:20:01,964
[SPEAKER_25]: Go!

1836
02:20:01,984 --> 02:20:03,825
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, I'll need to stop that!

1837
02:20:05,866 --> 02:20:07,287
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't have to!

1838
02:20:08,522 --> 02:20:11,624
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm getting sick and tired of hearing that ninja rap already.

1839
02:20:11,964 --> 02:20:14,125
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been over... Come here and make us!

1840
02:20:14,245 --> 02:20:14,766
[SPEAKER_06]: Damn!

1841
02:20:16,707 --> 02:20:17,467
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, what a good start.

1842
02:20:17,547 --> 02:20:20,369
[SPEAKER_27]: I like it when the callers berate us once in a while.

1843
02:20:21,069 --> 02:20:25,012
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, they better be ready to receive as good as they give.

1844
02:20:27,073 --> 02:20:28,674
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright, Siggy, what's on your mind?

1845
02:20:29,314 --> 02:20:34,137
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the money-wise, I finally... Who cares about the money?

1846
02:20:34,157 --> 02:20:35,438
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

1847
02:20:36,331 --> 02:20:40,633
[SPEAKER_06]: I finally AAA'd the most common another, which is Commento di Adieu.

1848
02:20:40,653 --> 02:20:42,674
[SPEAKER_27]: Ah, okay, good.

1849
02:20:43,474 --> 02:20:48,997
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and I've beaten some anothers as well, like Stoic and Murmurtwins.

1850
02:20:49,257 --> 02:20:51,498
[SPEAKER_27]: Now, Stoic is some scary shit on another.

1851
02:20:52,118 --> 02:20:53,099
[SPEAKER_06]: You're telling me.

1852
02:20:54,540 --> 02:20:55,240
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, good for you.

1853
02:20:55,281 --> 02:20:58,603
[SPEAKER_27]: So now your 2DX penis has just grown by about three centimeters.

1854
02:20:58,643 --> 02:20:59,503
[SPEAKER_27]: So congratulations.

1855
02:20:59,603 --> 02:21:00,204
[SPEAKER_27]: Go hump something.

1856
02:21:01,565 --> 02:21:01,905
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1857
02:21:02,965 --> 02:21:09,369
[SPEAKER_06]: And non-Bimani-wise, I'm planning to enter this Friday's World Series of Poker No Limit Hold'em Tournament.

1858
02:21:10,070 --> 02:21:10,410
[SPEAKER_27]: Really?

1859
02:21:11,151 --> 02:21:12,692
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah.

1860
02:21:13,832 --> 02:21:15,053
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, you live in Vegas, right?

1861
02:21:15,573 --> 02:21:15,794
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1862
02:21:15,934 --> 02:21:17,915
[SPEAKER_27]: So that's going to be very interesting being there.

1863
02:21:18,075 --> 02:21:19,556
[SPEAKER_27]: They got a prize or something?

1864
02:21:20,991 --> 02:21:23,772
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the top price is $350,000.

1865
02:21:23,812 --> 02:21:24,072
[SPEAKER_06]: Shit!

1866
02:21:24,112 --> 02:21:34,314
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just only for the minor No Limit Hold'em tournament, but the main event is going to be about $5 million.

1867
02:21:35,894 --> 02:21:36,215
[SPEAKER_27]: Wow.

1868
02:21:37,255 --> 02:21:38,555
[SPEAKER_27]: $5 million for poker?

1869
02:21:39,055 --> 02:21:39,935
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm in the wrong job.

1870
02:21:40,375 --> 02:21:41,116
[SPEAKER_27]: I can play poker.

1871
02:21:41,896 --> 02:21:43,496
[SPEAKER_06]: Not that good.

1872
02:21:44,156 --> 02:21:45,196
[SPEAKER_27]: I can play strip poker.

1873
02:21:45,237 --> 02:21:46,497
[SPEAKER_27]: I play strip poker for free.

1874
02:21:48,123 --> 02:21:53,145
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, strip poker is based on five-card... Draw?

1875
02:21:53,686 --> 02:21:54,406
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, five-card draw.

1876
02:21:54,506 --> 02:21:56,547
[SPEAKER_27]: And the tournament's Texas Hold'em?

1877
02:21:56,747 --> 02:21:57,167
[SPEAKER_27]: Or what is it?

1878
02:21:57,527 --> 02:21:58,508
[SPEAKER_27]: Texas Hold'em, no limit.

1879
02:21:58,708 --> 02:22:01,749
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, see, Texas Hold'em's like the big game right now because of all the TV shows.

1880
02:22:01,789 --> 02:22:03,450
[SPEAKER_26]: No one likes playing strip poker with me because I win.

1881
02:22:05,311 --> 02:22:05,831
[SPEAKER_26]: All the time.

1882
02:22:05,851 --> 02:22:08,092
[SPEAKER_26]: I, you know, beat them in poker and they're naked.

1883
02:22:08,592 --> 02:22:11,213
[SPEAKER_26]: Fucking women, you know, they don't want to play strip poker correctly.

1884
02:22:11,333 --> 02:22:13,594
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, they just like... I agree.

1885
02:22:13,674 --> 02:22:14,295
[SPEAKER_26]: Fucking women.

1886
02:22:16,617 --> 02:22:17,377
[SPEAKER_26]: I was just waiting for that.

1887
02:22:17,397 --> 02:22:19,978
[SPEAKER_26]: Well they freaking take off their clothes and they put a towel on.

1888
02:22:20,158 --> 02:22:21,158
[SPEAKER_26]: You can't do that.

1889
02:22:21,858 --> 02:22:23,379
[SPEAKER_26]: That's not the point of the game.

1890
02:22:24,759 --> 02:22:30,441
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh damn, speaking of strip poker, it's been over a decade since I've played strip poker on a computer.

1891
02:22:32,341 --> 02:22:35,782
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh my gosh, remember the old strip poker games on Apple II?

1892
02:22:37,701 --> 02:22:39,222
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh and Illusion, screw you!

1893
02:22:39,242 --> 02:22:40,162
[SPEAKER_27]: What did he say now?

1894
02:23:05,424 --> 02:23:08,826
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, tune in to see me lose on Series of Poker?

1895
02:23:08,846 --> 02:23:09,667
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, screw you!

1896
02:23:11,348 --> 02:23:13,409
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, you win that money, just to show him.

1897
02:23:13,690 --> 02:23:16,131
[SPEAKER_27]: And then you buy him something ugly.

1898
02:23:18,373 --> 02:23:19,293
[SPEAKER_27]: Like Britney Spears.

1899
02:23:19,454 --> 02:23:26,258
[SPEAKER_27]: Now, if you are able to buy this, or I'm sorry, if you're able to win this tournament, you will buy us a studio, right?

1900
02:23:27,659 --> 02:23:28,120
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1901
02:23:28,560 --> 02:23:29,981
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't thought about it.

1902
02:23:30,041 --> 02:23:34,424
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, first thing in mind is I might move to a new house.

1903
02:23:35,194 --> 02:23:36,615
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, I suppose that's got to be done too.

1904
02:23:36,655 --> 02:23:38,876
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm thinking I need to become friends with Michael Jackson.

1905
02:23:39,596 --> 02:23:40,297
[SPEAKER_06]: Ah, no way.

1906
02:23:40,317 --> 02:23:41,798
[SPEAKER_26]: You're not old, or you're too old.

1907
02:23:43,138 --> 02:23:43,579
[SPEAKER_26]: Why?

1908
02:23:43,839 --> 02:23:44,919
[SPEAKER_27]: I can understand him.

1909
02:23:48,041 --> 02:23:48,982
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm not even going to go there.

1910
02:23:51,623 --> 02:23:53,064
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright, anything else on your mind, Siggy?

1911
02:23:53,632 --> 02:24:02,194
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, nothing much else, but yeah, I really wanted... Hey, the song I gave you earlier, you should play that.

1912
02:24:02,654 --> 02:24:03,334
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll think about it.

1913
02:24:03,794 --> 02:24:04,294
[SPEAKER_27]: I'll think about it.

1914
02:24:04,314 --> 02:24:04,794
[SPEAKER_27]: That's a good point.

1915
02:24:04,874 --> 02:24:05,775
[SPEAKER_27]: Play my song.

1916
02:24:06,235 --> 02:24:07,375
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh yeah, I gotta play Loki's song.

1917
02:24:07,395 --> 02:24:09,555
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't know if I'm gonna have time, because I promised Loki I'd play it.

1918
02:24:09,695 --> 02:24:13,576
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, if you have some room, play Virocana.

1919
02:24:13,636 --> 02:24:15,337
[SPEAKER_27]: We'll see if we can squeeze it in somewhere.

1920
02:24:15,977 --> 02:24:16,197
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1921
02:24:16,597 --> 02:24:16,877
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright.

1922
02:24:17,997 --> 02:24:19,137
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright, we're gonna let you go now.

1923
02:24:19,558 --> 02:24:19,818
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright.

1924
02:24:19,978 --> 02:24:20,438
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright, later.

1925
02:24:20,998 --> 02:24:21,458
[SPEAKER_27]: Later.

1926
02:24:22,003 --> 02:24:24,425
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright, let's see if we have time for one more call.

1927
02:24:24,525 --> 02:24:30,729
[SPEAKER_27]: In the meantime, this clip here is supposed to have, I think, a clip of Genie in a Bottle in it?

1928
02:24:30,809 --> 02:24:31,169
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't know.

1929
02:24:31,289 --> 02:24:33,911
[SPEAKER_27]: Somebody had posted this over on The Freak, so now I'm all curious.

1930
02:24:34,231 --> 02:24:37,593
[SPEAKER_27]: Because I think this has a clip of the Genie in a Bottle mix that's on DDR Extreme.

1931
02:24:38,114 --> 02:24:43,858
[SPEAKER_27]: And if not, it'll be movie time, and a good chance for us to make fun of some... E3 Cam!

1932
02:24:43,938 --> 02:24:45,018
[SPEAKER_27]: It's the Fan Cam!

1933
02:24:45,078 --> 02:24:45,859
[SPEAKER_27]: Fan Cam!

1934
02:24:46,219 --> 02:24:46,880
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, it's...

1935
02:24:49,580 --> 02:24:50,581
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm sorry, Jamie, I'm trying.

1936
02:24:50,601 --> 02:24:51,702
[SPEAKER_08]: Why does he have a helmet on?

1937
02:24:51,722 --> 02:24:52,743
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, that's right, that's that guy I saw.

1938
02:24:52,763 --> 02:24:54,424
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, you can hear the genie in a bottle thing.

1939
02:24:54,444 --> 02:24:54,584
[SPEAKER_26]: Uh-oh.

1940
02:24:54,624 --> 02:24:55,345
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, shit, I broke it.

1941
02:24:55,445 --> 02:24:55,605
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay.

1942
02:25:14,823 --> 02:25:16,004
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, no, yeah, let's skip it.

1943
02:25:16,064 --> 02:25:19,566
[SPEAKER_27]: The tutorial's being skipped, and then they get, okay, here's the genie in a bottle, if you want to hear what this sounds like.

1944
02:25:20,126 --> 02:25:20,747
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, guys.

1945
02:25:24,409 --> 02:25:26,470
[SPEAKER_12]: Joel the fan cam does DDR.

1946
02:25:31,012 --> 02:25:31,973
[SPEAKER_27]: I can't hear this for shit.

1947
02:25:40,045 --> 02:25:42,227
[SPEAKER_27]: No, I'm turning this off because you can't hear it for crap.

1948
02:25:42,627 --> 02:25:45,889
[SPEAKER_27]: If you want to check this out, though, it's on E3insider.com.

1949
02:25:45,909 --> 02:25:47,110
[SPEAKER_27]: Just do a search for DDR.

1950
02:25:47,170 --> 02:25:50,012
[SPEAKER_27]: And if you turn up your speakers really, really loud, you can hear it.

1951
02:25:50,052 --> 02:25:52,053
[SPEAKER_27]: And you can hear what the new Genie in a Bottle and DDR sounds like.

1952
02:25:52,493 --> 02:25:54,695
[SPEAKER_27]: And supposedly, it's actually surprisingly good.

1953
02:25:54,715 --> 02:26:00,298
[SPEAKER_26]: Honestly, folks, if you want to know what Genie in a Bottle sounds like, just imagine a Dance Mania cover.

1954
02:26:00,438 --> 02:26:01,739
[SPEAKER_26]: That's what it is, basically.

1955
02:26:02,740 --> 02:26:03,120
[SPEAKER_27]: Pretty much.

1956
02:26:04,657 --> 02:26:04,938
[SPEAKER_27]: All right.

1957
02:26:07,300 --> 02:26:09,923
[SPEAKER_27]: We're going to get into the FUs of the week very shortly here.

1958
02:26:10,683 --> 02:26:11,945
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't see anybody else calling in.

1959
02:26:12,005 --> 02:26:15,628
[SPEAKER_27]: So we will do Loki's song and then we're going to do the FUs of the week.

1960
02:26:15,648 --> 02:26:20,233
[SPEAKER_27]: So start sending in the FUs of the week right now and we'll get to that.

1961
02:26:21,314 --> 02:26:23,076
[SPEAKER_27]: But Loki, what are we playing here from you?

1962
02:26:23,456 --> 02:26:25,277
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, this is right here, like I said before.

1963
02:26:25,377 --> 02:26:27,979
[SPEAKER_26]: It's not really a remix.

1964
02:26:28,039 --> 02:26:32,362
[SPEAKER_26]: It's just kind of, I extended the song a bit, and I added some samples on top of it.

1965
02:26:32,842 --> 02:26:42,569
[SPEAKER_26]: I thought about remixing it, but then I figured out that the song, the portions I have of the song, because it's only a minute long, really, the original, I didn't have enough to work with to make something.

1966
02:26:42,689 --> 02:26:45,951
[SPEAKER_26]: So, this is whatever crap it is.

1967
02:26:46,051 --> 02:26:48,653
[SPEAKER_26]: And I don't know what the actual title of the song is, so I called it Acid.

1968
02:26:48,753 --> 02:26:48,853
[SPEAKER_26]: It's

1969
02:26:49,448 --> 02:26:54,171
[SPEAKER_26]: Basically, the theme that they had playing in the trailer for Metal Gear Acid 2, and it was fucking awesome.

1970
02:26:54,251 --> 02:26:57,452
[SPEAKER_26]: Every time I heard the song at the Kanai booth, I'm like, I gotta get this song.

1971
02:26:57,592 --> 02:26:58,533
[SPEAKER_26]: I gotta get this song.

1972
02:26:58,593 --> 02:26:59,513
[SPEAKER_26]: I gotta get this song.

1973
02:26:59,593 --> 02:27:00,914
[SPEAKER_26]: So, I found it.

1974
02:27:01,695 --> 02:27:02,695
[SPEAKER_26]: I sort of extended it.

1975
02:27:03,075 --> 02:27:03,756
[SPEAKER_26]: It's pretty cool.

1976
02:27:04,436 --> 02:27:04,616
[SPEAKER_26]: Enjoy.

1977
02:27:25,645 --> 02:27:26,333
Metal Gear

1978
02:28:07,619 --> 02:28:08,188
Metal Gear

1979
02:28:48,410 --> 02:28:49,230
[SPEAKER_27]: That was wonderful.

1980
02:28:50,971 --> 02:28:52,391
[SPEAKER_27]: We're back on Orange Launch Radio, by the way.

1981
02:28:52,691 --> 02:28:52,972
[SPEAKER_27]: Loki.

1982
02:28:54,072 --> 02:28:55,352
[SPEAKER_27]: So anything else you want to say about that mix?

1983
02:28:55,672 --> 02:28:56,413
[SPEAKER_26]: No, not really.

1984
02:28:56,853 --> 02:28:57,413
[SPEAKER_26]: It's just awesome.

1985
02:28:57,753 --> 02:28:59,894
[SPEAKER_26]: I just needed to make a version of it that could play in my car.

1986
02:29:00,114 --> 02:29:00,594
[SPEAKER_26]: That's about it.

1987
02:29:01,835 --> 02:29:02,215
[SPEAKER_26]: Who knows?

1988
02:29:02,295 --> 02:29:04,555
[SPEAKER_26]: I might work on that later, maybe to add something.

1989
02:29:04,876 --> 02:29:13,879
[SPEAKER_26]: I am, however, going to work on something because there's another song that I liked in another trailer, and I found the trailer today for Coated Arms that's going to be a remix of Trip Machine eventually.

1990
02:29:13,979 --> 02:29:17,300
[SPEAKER_26]: But this is just something for now.

1991
02:29:17,560 --> 02:29:18,020
[SPEAKER_26]: It's just fun.

1992
02:29:19,807 --> 02:29:20,928
[SPEAKER_26]: This is because I like that song.

1993
02:29:20,948 --> 02:29:25,812
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, yep, I picked different music again this week because I just cannot decide.

1994
02:29:50,509 --> 02:29:52,970
[SPEAKER_21]: Big SU goes to bloating.

1995
02:29:54,551 --> 02:29:55,932
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm not going to say anything more about that.

1996
02:29:56,993 --> 02:30:00,114
[SPEAKER_21]: An SU goes to my car being completely undriveable now.

1997
02:30:00,254 --> 02:30:04,117
[SPEAKER_21]: My fiancé, bless him, tried to hammer the fender back into place.

1998
02:30:05,497 --> 02:30:08,919
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, I can drive it if I want to go left all the time.

1999
02:30:09,720 --> 02:30:11,100
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, it's undriveable.

2000
02:30:11,601 --> 02:30:12,041
[SPEAKER_21]: Unsafe.

2001
02:30:13,162 --> 02:30:13,522
[SPEAKER_21]: Sigh.

2002
02:30:15,413 --> 02:30:30,609
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, also, um, you know, she was a nice lady, has always done a great job doing my haircut, but my hair got cut way too short, and then I, you know, my scalp is still red from dyeing it, so, big F you to that, too.

2003
02:30:30,629 --> 02:30:30,669
[SPEAKER_21]: Um...

2004
02:30:34,131 --> 02:30:37,294
[SPEAKER_21]: F you to my nerves and F you to me putting off stuff that needs to get done.

2005
02:30:37,515 --> 02:30:42,480
[SPEAKER_21]: And that's really... Oh yeah, and a big ol' F you to my work for changing all of my damn job duties.

2006
02:30:42,740 --> 02:30:43,741
[SPEAKER_21]: Whoa, it's an E3!

2007
02:30:44,081 --> 02:30:45,943
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, big fuck off to that.

2008
02:30:45,963 --> 02:30:46,824
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, I'm done.

2009
02:30:49,066 --> 02:30:49,427
[SPEAKER_26]: Loki.

2010
02:30:52,104 --> 02:31:04,333
[SPEAKER_26]: First off, fuck you to everybody that's not on Final Fantasy XI because, you know, it's very quiet when I come online to play, you know, late at night and there's just me.

2011
02:31:04,913 --> 02:31:06,154
[SPEAKER_26]: I can't really talk to myself.

2012
02:31:06,294 --> 02:31:06,935
[SPEAKER_26]: It's not fun.

2013
02:31:07,535 --> 02:31:09,657
[SPEAKER_26]: And everyone else is Japanese and that doesn't work.

2014
02:31:10,677 --> 02:31:11,478
[SPEAKER_26]: So that sucks.

2015
02:31:12,539 --> 02:31:13,179
[SPEAKER_26]: You'll get over it.

2016
02:31:13,780 --> 02:31:14,560
[SPEAKER_26]: Or you'll quit too.

2017
02:31:15,061 --> 02:31:15,921
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm not quitting.

2018
02:31:16,001 --> 02:31:18,763
[SPEAKER_26]: I have dedicated too much time to my character.

2019
02:31:18,783 --> 02:31:21,185
[SPEAKER_26]: I will stay on until that game stops working.

2020
02:31:22,461 --> 02:31:26,124
[SPEAKER_26]: or I become level 75 in every single job and have finished every single bit of that game.

2021
02:31:26,705 --> 02:31:27,806
[SPEAKER_26]: And then I'll sell my character.

2022
02:31:29,287 --> 02:31:30,368
[SPEAKER_26]: And make some mad cash.

2023
02:31:30,748 --> 02:31:41,117
[SPEAKER_26]: Anyways, um, then, uh, also, just, basically, you know, fuck you to Robot Chicken for sucking the last few weeks, and fuck you to the fact that I missed Family Guy tonight.

2024
02:31:42,678 --> 02:31:43,339
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, it's not on?

2025
02:31:43,879 --> 02:31:44,140
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, well.

2026
02:31:44,600 --> 02:31:45,221
[SPEAKER_27]: Never mind, then.

2027
02:31:46,342 --> 02:31:48,964
[SPEAKER_27]: Family Guy is not on tonight, so listen to Orange on Radio.

2028
02:31:51,059 --> 02:31:51,219
[SPEAKER_26]: Anyway.

2029
02:31:51,239 --> 02:31:53,620
[SPEAKER_21]: And if you heard that, you already are listening to Orntown Radio.

2030
02:31:53,880 --> 02:31:57,321
[SPEAKER_26]: And also, um, fuck you to Arnold Schwarzenegger, because he can act.

2031
02:31:58,121 --> 02:32:02,263
[SPEAKER_26]: And, um, he can't really govern either, so I don't really know what his talent is yet.

2032
02:32:02,603 --> 02:32:03,543
[SPEAKER_26]: He can lift weights!

2033
02:32:04,183 --> 02:32:05,384
[SPEAKER_26]: He should be a weightlifter.

2034
02:32:05,804 --> 02:32:06,204
[SPEAKER_26]: The end.

2035
02:32:06,744 --> 02:32:13,327
[SPEAKER_26]: Um, and also, um, fuck you to everyone that's seen this new commercial with, um, Paris Hilton is too scantily clad.

2036
02:32:13,607 --> 02:32:13,947
[SPEAKER_26]: Honestly...

2037
02:32:14,927 --> 02:32:18,670
[SPEAKER_26]: Whatever, it's just blatant, you know, sex sells, you know, burger commercial.

2038
02:32:19,190 --> 02:32:20,752
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't see anything wrong with that, to be honest.

2039
02:32:21,052 --> 02:32:23,394
[SPEAKER_26]: Hell, if she's gonna be a whore, let her be a whore on TV.

2040
02:32:23,414 --> 02:32:26,036
[SPEAKER_26]: At least she's, you know, scantily clad and stuff and showing off her body.

2041
02:32:26,856 --> 02:32:30,019
[SPEAKER_26]: Big deal, you know, honestly, because that's her only talent.

2042
02:32:30,179 --> 02:32:33,642
[SPEAKER_26]: So, just let her, you know, let her work her talent.

2043
02:32:34,349 --> 02:32:38,170
[SPEAKER_26]: You know, eventually she's gonna do mainstream porn and that'll be, uh, happy.

2044
02:32:38,810 --> 02:32:47,552
[SPEAKER_26]: And, um, finally, um, I'd like to mention, um, a fuck you to, uh, Patrick Swayze for being just all weird.

2045
02:32:47,992 --> 02:32:53,673
[SPEAKER_26]: Because he's coming to our work next week and signing autographs, so I'm actually gonna get an autograph of his for some reason.

2046
02:32:54,293 --> 02:33:03,515
[SPEAKER_26]: And, um, but he doesn't want anyone to, he doesn't want to sign anything that has to do with older projects he's worked on, i.e., like, you know, um,

2047
02:33:04,187 --> 02:33:07,349
[SPEAKER_26]: Dirty Dancin' or something like that, and he doesn't want you to touch him in any way.

2048
02:33:08,490 --> 02:33:10,731
[SPEAKER_26]: Aw, so you can't give Patrick Swayze a hug?

2049
02:33:11,512 --> 02:33:12,472
[SPEAKER_26]: Or shake his hand or anything?

2050
02:33:12,512 --> 02:33:13,113
[SPEAKER_26]: He's like, AH!

2051
02:33:13,753 --> 02:33:15,034
[SPEAKER_26]: You know, just like, but anyways.

2052
02:33:15,414 --> 02:33:17,115
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, Patrick Swayze's coming to my work.

2053
02:33:17,575 --> 02:33:18,296
[SPEAKER_26]: That's awesome.

2054
02:33:18,996 --> 02:33:20,917
[SPEAKER_26]: But, you know, I just don't really care either.

2055
02:33:21,158 --> 02:33:29,583
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm hoping, the best person that came to our work, actually the two best people, Pauly Shore and, um, oh god, Rob Schneider.

2056
02:33:30,403 --> 02:33:30,904
[SPEAKER_26]: My favorites.

2057
02:33:31,684 --> 02:33:32,264
[SPEAKER_26]: Alright, I'm done.

2058
02:33:32,344 --> 02:33:33,165
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't really have anything.

2059
02:33:41,195 --> 02:33:45,679
[SPEAKER_27]: and F you to me feeling selfish because I'm not getting what I want and that makes me very sad.

2060
02:33:47,980 --> 02:33:52,584
[SPEAKER_27]: And just F you to general blahness that I've kind of been dealing with the past few days.

2061
02:33:53,485 --> 02:33:56,487
[SPEAKER_27]: And F you to feeling an utter lack of something.

2062
02:33:57,408 --> 02:34:01,571
[SPEAKER_27]: And not being sure there's a lot that you can do about it.

2063
02:34:03,232 --> 02:34:05,794
[SPEAKER_27]: But yeah, I guess that's it.

2064
02:34:06,335 --> 02:34:07,155
[SPEAKER_27]: Was that cryptic enough?

2065
02:34:07,215 --> 02:34:07,516
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't know.

2066
02:34:07,756 --> 02:34:08,616
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright, let's move on.

2067
02:34:08,676 --> 02:34:08,997
[SPEAKER_27]: Bradley.

2068
02:34:12,226 --> 02:34:18,891
[SPEAKER_24]: Fuck you to my computer being old and my power supply burning out and causing all this computer drama.

2069
02:34:19,431 --> 02:34:27,917
[SPEAKER_24]: Hopefully I can sort of push money around somewhere to, or at least to build a skeleton computer or something new.

2070
02:34:29,298 --> 02:34:31,059
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm hopefully going to do that soon.

2071
02:34:32,139 --> 02:34:32,760
[SPEAKER_27]: That's about all.

2072
02:34:34,861 --> 02:34:37,803
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright, let's go on to the chatroom FUs.

2073
02:34:37,983 --> 02:34:39,004
[SPEAKER_27]: Dynamite Rage!

2074
02:34:43,188 --> 02:34:45,649
[SPEAKER_27]: Chimera wants to give an FU to GOTS.

2075
02:34:47,369 --> 02:34:50,610
[SPEAKER_27]: Just remember, if you make fun of GOTS, you still play DDR.

2076
02:34:50,910 --> 02:34:51,710
[SPEAKER_21]: I would be Chimera.

2077
02:34:52,951 --> 02:34:53,791
[SPEAKER_27]: Close Chimera.

2078
02:34:53,831 --> 02:34:54,671
[SPEAKER_22]: Close Chimera.

2079
02:34:55,811 --> 02:34:58,272
[SPEAKER_21]: The CH is a hard K sound.

2080
02:34:59,572 --> 02:34:59,892
[SPEAKER_27]: Whatever.

2081
02:35:00,613 --> 02:35:04,154
[SPEAKER_27]: Laser123454321 says, FU to Copyright Enforcement.

2082
02:35:05,834 --> 02:35:07,874
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, that sucks when you want to steal someone else's work.

2083
02:35:08,335 --> 02:35:09,655
[SPEAKER_27]: And FU to New Orleans.

2084
02:35:10,451 --> 02:35:12,853
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, fuck it, MPAA is shutting down some foreign sites.

2085
02:35:13,714 --> 02:35:14,134
[SPEAKER_24]: Bitches.

2086
02:35:14,534 --> 02:35:16,696
[SPEAKER_24]: Especially the TV ones, like, you get new shows.

2087
02:35:17,557 --> 02:35:23,281
[SPEAKER_27]: MPQ says, F you to myself for forgetting last week that forum drama is retarded.

2088
02:35:24,963 --> 02:35:26,464
[SPEAKER_27]: Aw, I want more details on that one.

2089
02:35:28,185 --> 02:35:32,789
[SPEAKER_27]: Dark Knight says, F you to working this weekend, including Monday and missing out on the cookouts.

2090
02:35:36,815 --> 02:35:43,058
[SPEAKER_27]: Ninst says, F you to half the people I went to Anime North with as they forgot about Mimos of Saturday.

2091
02:35:43,819 --> 02:35:54,645
[SPEAKER_27]: F you to the MyBank, I think that meant say, Ninst says F you to MyBank, as I was unable to draw money for my account this weekend from ATMs and I can't find out why till Tuesday.

2092
02:36:00,248 --> 02:36:04,290
[SPEAKER_27]: DarkTetsuya says, F you to Trip Machine, Survivor, Light.

2093
02:36:04,790 --> 02:36:06,151
[SPEAKER_27]: I can't seem to get it triple A'd.

2094
02:36:10,678 --> 02:36:33,533
[SPEAKER_27]: OMG It's Doobz says F you to finals for being so damn hard to study for F you to DDR players that live in Ohio for being so friggin good and last F you to you Sky for being sarcastic on my Skype call don't hate on me and my four centimeter penis I think he meant plus four centimeter penis but isn't it funnier when I say four centimeter penis

2095
02:36:35,393 --> 02:36:41,535
[SPEAKER_26]: You know, that's funny, it's like, you know, like Final Fantasy, penis plus one, you know, penis plus four centimeters.

2096
02:36:44,516 --> 02:36:49,578
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, and F you to Florida, because I have to move this summer, and I don't know anyone who plays DDR at North.

2097
02:36:52,950 --> 02:36:56,114
[SPEAKER_27]: BlackDevilerX says F you to my mic system for being jacked up.

2098
02:36:56,174 --> 02:36:57,475
[SPEAKER_27]: I keep hearing myself echo.

2099
02:36:58,056 --> 02:36:59,478
[SPEAKER_27]: F you to finals in two weeks.

2100
02:37:00,018 --> 02:37:03,643
[SPEAKER_27]: F you to DarkSakura for taking my god-given voice away.

2101
02:37:03,743 --> 02:37:04,363
[SPEAKER_27]: No, just kidding.

2102
02:37:04,423 --> 02:37:04,944
[SPEAKER_27]: I was being mean.

2103
02:37:05,785 --> 02:37:07,687
[SPEAKER_27]: F you to missing the first 15 minutes of the show.

2104
02:37:08,188 --> 02:37:11,432
[SPEAKER_27]: F you in general that I haven't been able to listen to the show in so long.

2105
02:37:16,385 --> 02:37:23,668
[SPEAKER_27]: and Illusion says, F you to having to fix all the bugs and not knowing how to have an exit function in my new game, Oblivion.

2106
02:37:24,448 --> 02:37:32,231
[SPEAKER_27]: F you to having to censor Dammit Janet at karaoke last night saying, Janet, Janet, I love you, instead of the real lyric, Dammit Janet, I love you.

2107
02:37:33,152 --> 02:37:35,533
[SPEAKER_27]: They should have censored it to fucking Janet.

2108
02:37:36,173 --> 02:37:37,233
[SPEAKER_27]: Fuck off, bitch!

2109
02:37:38,054 --> 02:37:40,875
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh well, we still get to do Rock Your Picture Show music, and that's the last one.

2110
02:37:41,055 --> 02:37:41,495
[SPEAKER_16]: That's good.

2111
02:37:42,950 --> 02:37:49,053
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright, yeah, I agree that what you should do, Illusion, is your very last night at karaoke at that place.

2112
02:37:49,273 --> 02:38:08,544
[SPEAKER_27]: First off, stop going to a family-friendly establishment for karaoke, but I understand you're probably not old enough to get into a bar yet, so you can keep doing that for now, but then when you're old enough to get to a bar, do your last hurrah at karaoke, and when you've got the mic in your hand, on the very last Dammit Janet, go, fuck off, bitch, I wanna screw, and then just walk out before they throw you out.

2113
02:38:09,637 --> 02:38:09,917
[SPEAKER_27]: Run.

2114
02:38:10,417 --> 02:38:11,158
[SPEAKER_27]: What are they going to do?

2115
02:38:11,258 --> 02:38:12,338
[SPEAKER_27]: Turn the mics off on you?

2116
02:38:12,438 --> 02:38:12,859
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, no.

2117
02:38:13,039 --> 02:38:14,720
[SPEAKER_17]: Ow, my freaking ears.

2118
02:38:17,101 --> 02:38:18,561
[SPEAKER_17]: My ears are bleeding.

2119
02:38:18,581 --> 02:38:21,903
[SPEAKER_17]: I heard naughty words, and I'm going to go to hell for it.

2120
02:38:22,784 --> 02:38:26,005
[SPEAKER_17]: I want to have sex with prostitutes now, Mommy.

2121
02:38:32,028 --> 02:38:33,289
[SPEAKER_17]: Because I saw it on TV.

2122
02:38:33,919 --> 02:38:41,463
[SPEAKER_27]: That's the nice thing about karaoke, where I go to karaoke, is that you can replace the lyrics with, fuck off, bitch, I wanna screw, and then they laugh.

2123
02:38:42,304 --> 02:38:47,026
[SPEAKER_21]: I was remembering the touch-a-touch-a line, that was funny.

2124
02:38:47,266 --> 02:38:48,507
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, fuck-a-fuck-a-fuck me?

2125
02:38:48,827 --> 02:38:52,870
[SPEAKER_27]: No, you went up there and... Oh, yeah, who was singing it, Jessica?

2126
02:38:52,890 --> 02:38:53,330
[SPEAKER_27]: Jessica was.

2127
02:38:53,430 --> 02:38:58,733
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, Jessica, a guana girl was up on stage singing touch-a-touch-a-touch me, so I walked up on stage and grabbed her boobs.

2128
02:39:03,547 --> 02:39:04,588
[SPEAKER_21]: That cracks me up.

2129
02:39:09,632 --> 02:39:10,453
[SPEAKER_27]: Anyways, oh yeah.

2130
02:39:10,573 --> 02:39:12,815
[SPEAKER_27]: Did we mention that we sometimes use foul language on this show?

2131
02:39:13,456 --> 02:39:15,437
[SPEAKER_27]: This is your program because I need language.

2132
02:39:17,760 --> 02:39:18,840
[SPEAKER_21]: We gave the disclaimer.

2133
02:39:19,321 --> 02:39:21,823
[SPEAKER_21]: If people are offended by it, you heard the disclaimer.

2134
02:39:22,003 --> 02:39:22,564
[SPEAKER_27]: Fuck off.

2135
02:39:22,784 --> 02:39:23,244
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

2136
02:39:26,047 --> 02:39:26,387
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright.

2137
02:39:27,688 --> 02:39:29,110
[SPEAKER_27]: We're going to do another quickie break here.

2138
02:39:29,470 --> 02:39:30,631
[SPEAKER_17]: I love internet radio!

2139
02:39:31,581 --> 02:39:35,624
[SPEAKER_27]: Just an uber quick break here, and then we're going to come back with Ask Orange Lounge.

2140
02:39:35,664 --> 02:39:39,607
[SPEAKER_27]: So you guys have a few minutes to get in your questions for Ask Orange Lounge.

2141
02:39:39,647 --> 02:39:41,548
[SPEAKER_27]: You can ask us anything you want, within reason.

2142
02:39:42,829 --> 02:39:45,631
[SPEAKER_27]: And send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your question.

2143
02:39:45,671 --> 02:39:48,794
[SPEAKER_27]: It's your chance to direct the show the way you want.

2144
02:39:49,634 --> 02:39:53,537
[SPEAKER_27]: We'll be back after this, featuring some music from DDR Solo.

2145
02:39:54,558 --> 02:39:57,460
[SPEAKER_27]: Because I kind of want to strut my funky stuff right about now.

2146
02:39:58,020 --> 02:39:58,961
[SPEAKER_27]: So we'll be back after this.

2147
02:40:01,715 --> 02:40:02,370
[SPEAKER_27]: Come on, come on!

2148
02:41:46,454 --> 02:41:47,596
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

2149
02:42:58,032 --> 02:43:00,055
[SPEAKER_18]: Love and Peace is our fight.

2150
02:43:27,592 --> 02:43:28,817
I will follow only you

2151
02:44:27,360 --> 02:44:36,711
[SPEAKER_05]: And now, let's listen in to an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting as they debate some of the new programming coming to Orange Lounge Radio.

2152
02:44:37,459 --> 02:44:41,540
[SPEAKER_27]: Jamie, I have a suggestion about some of the music in our Bomani Music and More program.

2153
02:44:41,560 --> 02:44:42,521
[SPEAKER_27]: Can we talk about that?

2154
02:44:42,801 --> 02:44:45,141
[SPEAKER_10]: No subject will ever be taboo.

2155
02:44:45,442 --> 02:44:49,063
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, I was thinking maybe we should move Pump Up the Volume from Tuesday Nights.

2156
02:44:49,603 --> 02:44:52,144
[SPEAKER_27]: Except, of course, a subject that was just under discussion.

2157
02:44:52,644 --> 02:44:57,985
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, well, what would you think if maybe we cut back on some of the tack music we play on the station?

2158
02:44:58,546 --> 02:44:59,826
[SPEAKER_10]: I collect your fucking head.

2159
02:45:01,801 --> 02:45:03,302
[SPEAKER_16]: Just like this fucker here.

2160
02:45:04,383 --> 02:45:08,067
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh my god, why did you do that to Loki?

2161
02:45:08,367 --> 02:45:11,730
[SPEAKER_16]: The holic thing on episode 69 was just a joke!

2162
02:45:12,671 --> 02:45:19,117
[SPEAKER_10]: Now if any of you sons of bitches got anything else to say, now's the fucking time!

2163
02:45:20,338 --> 02:45:24,061
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Lounge Radio, where everybody has a say.

2164
02:45:29,560 --> 02:45:31,381
[SPEAKER_27]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

2165
02:45:31,441 --> 02:45:33,962
[SPEAKER_27]: Loki's saying nobody gets the Episode 69 thing anymore.

2166
02:45:34,262 --> 02:45:34,983
[SPEAKER_27]: You're probably right.

2167
02:45:35,843 --> 02:45:37,784
[SPEAKER_21]: I wasn't even here for Episode 69.

2168
02:45:40,606 --> 02:45:43,927
[SPEAKER_27]: Which, in a way, kind of makes it funnier when you consider all the holic thing, you know?

2169
02:45:44,167 --> 02:45:46,769
[SPEAKER_27]: But, anyway.

2170
02:45:46,829 --> 02:45:49,430
[SPEAKER_27]: We actually have quite a few questions tonight for Ask Orange Lounge.

2171
02:45:49,470 --> 02:45:53,612
[SPEAKER_27]: Usually I'm having to beg and plead for questions, but people just want to know shit tonight, so this is good.

2172
02:45:54,513 --> 02:45:55,053
[SPEAKER_27]: Let's get to it. ...

2173
02:46:01,570 --> 02:46:04,532
[SPEAKER_27]: Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.

2174
02:46:05,012 --> 02:46:08,234
[SPEAKER_27]: What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?

2175
02:46:08,654 --> 02:46:13,737
[SPEAKER_27]: We've got a lot of questions and only 10 minutes left of show, so we better hurry through.

2176
02:46:13,757 --> 02:46:15,658
[SPEAKER_27]: These questions are somewhere getting left in the dust.

2177
02:46:21,882 --> 02:46:22,282
[SPEAKER_27]: Illusion.

2178
02:46:23,898 --> 02:46:30,026
[SPEAKER_27]: Question for Loki, you often do remixes of Babani songs, but do you do any original songs?

2179
02:46:30,687 --> 02:46:32,369
[SPEAKER_27]: And if you do, would you ever release a CD?

2180
02:46:33,624 --> 02:46:37,566
[SPEAKER_26]: Um, I do original songs, but it's been a looong time.

2181
02:46:38,626 --> 02:46:40,527
[SPEAKER_26]: We've played some of them on the station before.

2182
02:46:40,547 --> 02:46:42,547
[SPEAKER_27]: It was a long time ago when you did original stuff.

2183
02:46:42,647 --> 02:46:43,468
[SPEAKER_26]: Why'd you stop?

2184
02:46:43,808 --> 02:46:48,389
[SPEAKER_26]: It's just, I was using old programs like EJ and stuff, and I- Lazy.

2185
02:46:48,990 --> 02:46:55,712
[SPEAKER_26]: No, not lazy, it's just the sound samples I didn't really want to work with, and I tried to upgrade programs and stuff to something that would be more fun to work with.

2186
02:46:56,613 --> 02:46:58,473
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't know, I- I don't know.

2187
02:46:58,813 --> 02:46:59,113
[SPEAKER_26]: We'll see.

2188
02:47:00,014 --> 02:47:00,274
[SPEAKER_26]: Maybe.

2189
02:47:01,636 --> 02:47:08,538
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, now, you did put together a compilation CD, but you only did like two or three copies of the CD, right?

2190
02:47:08,578 --> 02:47:10,739
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, yeah, because I have all the files.

2191
02:47:10,799 --> 02:47:15,180
[SPEAKER_26]: Originally, it was going to be one of those create-your-own-CD-type situations on like a website.

2192
02:47:15,540 --> 02:47:18,681
[SPEAKER_26]: Of course, web hosting, you know, it's not too reliable, so, yeah.

2193
02:47:20,345 --> 02:47:21,386
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, I hate that.

2194
02:47:21,506 --> 02:47:24,107
[SPEAKER_26]: I just can't find any websites with unlimited bandwidth or anything.

2195
02:47:24,768 --> 02:47:26,629
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright, let's move on.

2196
02:47:26,669 --> 02:47:29,951
[SPEAKER_27]: Jin4576 says, Namco Cross Capcom came out in Japan recently.

2197
02:47:30,291 --> 02:47:32,052
[SPEAKER_27]: Do you think that it will come out here in the US?

2198
02:47:32,592 --> 02:47:33,013
[SPEAKER_27]: Of course.

2199
02:47:33,173 --> 02:47:33,813
[SPEAKER_27]: My answer is yes.

2200
02:47:34,073 --> 02:47:35,154
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, it definitely will come out here.

2201
02:47:35,194 --> 02:47:36,455
[SPEAKER_27]: In fact, I think it's already been announced.

2202
02:47:37,015 --> 02:47:38,856
[SPEAKER_27]: They just didn't show it at E3 for whatever reason.

2203
02:47:39,617 --> 02:47:41,958
[SPEAKER_27]: So, I expect you'll probably see it, what, Christmas time?

2204
02:47:41,978 --> 02:47:42,639
[SPEAKER_27]: What do you think?

2205
02:47:42,859 --> 02:47:43,159
[SPEAKER_27]: Probably.

2206
02:47:43,179 --> 02:47:43,699
[SPEAKER_15]: Does that sound good?

2207
02:47:44,280 --> 02:47:45,080
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, I like that idea.

2208
02:47:46,401 --> 02:47:47,041
[SPEAKER_27]: It'll come out here.

2209
02:47:47,862 --> 02:47:49,903
[SPEAKER_27]: I think that's too big a game to not come out here.

2210
02:47:51,388 --> 02:47:57,731
[SPEAKER_27]: Laser123454321 wants to know, what would be a good licensed song for Beatmania USA?

2211
02:48:00,612 --> 02:48:02,392
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, like I said before, name of the game.

2212
02:48:03,193 --> 02:48:03,773
[SPEAKER_26]: That'd be good.

2213
02:48:05,253 --> 02:48:15,918
[SPEAKER_26]: There's a lot of stuff that would lend itself pretty well to... You can even do, like, if you want to really get obscure, you can do the Beck remixes with the 8-bit remixes for his stuff.

2214
02:48:16,178 --> 02:48:17,898
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, the Ghetto Chip Malfunction and stuff like that?

2215
02:48:17,918 --> 02:48:19,059
[SPEAKER_26]: You can get some of that in there.

2216
02:48:21,499 --> 02:48:23,260
[SPEAKER_26]: Thanks for watching!

2217
02:48:38,064 --> 02:48:38,504
[SPEAKER_26]: Exactly!

2218
02:48:38,705 --> 02:48:39,925
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh my god, MIDI head stuff.

2219
02:48:40,005 --> 02:48:42,287
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, that's, I think, where they should go.

2220
02:48:42,427 --> 02:48:43,088
[SPEAKER_26]: And ToeJam.

2221
02:48:43,188 --> 02:48:44,489
[SPEAKER_26]: I bet ToeJam's gonna be in there.

2222
02:48:44,529 --> 02:48:53,315
[SPEAKER_26]: Just because it's, you know, a different drum song, and it was in, you know, the 2DX... Technically, Big Idea is in a different drum.

2223
02:48:53,435 --> 02:48:54,656
[SPEAKER_27]: But I know what you're saying.

2224
02:48:55,216 --> 02:48:56,878
[SPEAKER_27]: It was a US song, and now it's in Happy Sky.

2225
02:48:57,138 --> 02:48:57,318
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah.

2226
02:48:57,438 --> 02:48:57,938
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, who knows.

2227
02:48:58,779 --> 02:48:59,219
[SPEAKER_27]: That'd be neat.

2228
02:49:00,060 --> 02:49:04,023
[SPEAKER_27]: I, personally, I really want Echo Image Skulk.

2229
02:49:04,723 --> 02:49:05,964
[SPEAKER_27]: Or at least some Echo Image song.

2230
02:49:06,384 --> 02:49:06,805
[SPEAKER_27]: That'd be cool.

2231
02:49:07,506 --> 02:49:17,192
[SPEAKER_27]: Kymera, since I got criticized for my pronunciation, wants to know, Yo, do you think it would be ethical to cheat friends of their souls, like in a game of high stakes poker?

2232
02:49:17,873 --> 02:49:18,413
[SPEAKER_21]: Absolutely not.

2233
02:49:18,453 --> 02:49:20,835
[SPEAKER_21]: If they're stupid enough to bet it, then they're stupid enough to lose it.

2234
02:49:20,875 --> 02:49:24,517
[SPEAKER_27]: Like if you're going to sell your soul for a donut, I mean... Or sell your soul for $5.

2235
02:49:24,617 --> 02:49:25,398
[SPEAKER_26]: Or sell it on eBay.

2236
02:49:25,418 --> 02:49:26,759
[SPEAKER_21]: That would be a fucking good donut.

2237
02:49:28,143 --> 02:49:29,985
[SPEAKER_26]: Also, shouldn't Maddox get his own forums?

2238
02:49:45,821 --> 02:49:47,862
[SPEAKER_27]: I hate Cameron Diaz I hate Cameron Diaz too

2239
02:50:10,448 --> 02:50:12,849
[SPEAKER_26]: It's because of that stupid MTV show that she does now.

2240
02:50:13,469 --> 02:50:14,830
[SPEAKER_26]: An MTV show?

2241
02:50:15,630 --> 02:50:16,070
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah.

2242
02:50:16,550 --> 02:50:19,971
[SPEAKER_26]: She goes to all the parts of the world that are poor.

2243
02:50:20,291 --> 02:50:23,873
[SPEAKER_26]: Like, you know, Africa and the Amazon and blah blah blah.

2244
02:50:23,893 --> 02:50:28,154
[SPEAKER_27]: Look, he doesn't need forums because people talk about him on other forums.

2245
02:50:28,574 --> 02:50:30,275
[SPEAKER_27]: Look, we're talking about him now.

2246
02:50:30,335 --> 02:50:32,396
[SPEAKER_27]: This is free publicity he didn't pay for.

2247
02:50:33,716 --> 02:50:34,496
[SPEAKER_27]: He doesn't need forums.

2248
02:50:35,517 --> 02:50:36,737
[SPEAKER_26]: It would just be annoying, trust me.

2249
02:50:36,897 --> 02:50:37,557
[SPEAKER_26]: He wouldn't do it.

2250
02:50:38,638 --> 02:50:39,198
[SPEAKER_26]: I wouldn't want him.

2251
02:50:39,625 --> 02:50:40,886
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, I wouldn't do it.

2252
02:50:41,767 --> 02:50:45,530
[SPEAKER_27]: Chubs wants to know, what is the circumference of your left wrist?

2253
02:50:46,110 --> 02:50:46,991
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, that's a good question.

2254
02:50:47,331 --> 02:50:51,594
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't have one of those bendy rulers, though, like a fabric ruler that you would use to measure fabric that can bend around.

2255
02:50:51,634 --> 02:50:53,236
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't have one of those, so I can't really measure it.

2256
02:50:54,356 --> 02:50:57,139
[SPEAKER_27]: I know this is radio, but it's about that big.

2257
02:50:57,959 --> 02:50:58,660
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, let's see here.

2258
02:50:59,200 --> 02:51:06,166
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, now everyone knows that if you point your finger like a gun, that is how big your penis is, supposedly, okay?

2259
02:51:06,366 --> 02:51:06,546
[SPEAKER_26]: What?

2260
02:51:06,566 --> 02:51:06,706
[SPEAKER_26]: What?

2261
02:51:06,726 --> 02:51:06,886
[SPEAKER_26]: What?

2262
02:51:08,974 --> 02:51:09,515
[SPEAKER_26]: Supposedly.

2263
02:51:09,535 --> 02:51:11,338
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't have to worry about that.

2264
02:51:11,358 --> 02:51:12,580
[SPEAKER_26]: Hold on, I'm looking at something here.

2265
02:51:12,960 --> 02:51:13,421
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, never mind.

2266
02:51:15,484 --> 02:51:18,950
[SPEAKER_26]: So I would say roughly the circumference... Hold on, I need to go in the bathroom for a minute.

2267
02:51:22,168 --> 02:51:24,509
[SPEAKER_21]: I would say mine's about 7 inches around.

2268
02:51:24,549 --> 02:51:25,810
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, I'd say about that too.

2269
02:51:26,450 --> 02:51:26,870
[SPEAKER_21]: My wrist.

2270
02:51:27,070 --> 02:51:27,571
[SPEAKER_27]: Let's see.

2271
02:51:27,931 --> 02:51:28,611
[SPEAKER_27]: Who cares?

2272
02:51:28,991 --> 02:51:31,913
[SPEAKER_27]: My thumb is just touching my index finger.

2273
02:51:32,793 --> 02:51:37,695
[SPEAKER_21]: You're supposed to use your index finger between your knuckles.

2274
02:51:37,795 --> 02:51:39,196
[SPEAKER_26]: I'd say 12 inches.

2275
02:51:40,857 --> 02:51:41,617
[SPEAKER_26]: Forget it.

2276
02:51:41,757 --> 02:51:42,157
[SPEAKER_26]: 12 inches.

2277
02:51:42,898 --> 02:51:44,338
[SPEAKER_26]: Can you lick your elbow?

2278
02:51:44,759 --> 02:51:45,159
[SPEAKER_26]: Forget it.

2279
02:51:53,223 --> 02:51:59,844
[SPEAKER_27]: Dark Knight wants to know, oh Sky, I finally got an MP3 player that can handle multiple episodes of Orange Lounge Radio to go now.

2280
02:52:00,304 --> 02:52:04,165
[SPEAKER_27]: So the only thing I worry about now is losing it because it's a small house MP3 player.

2281
02:52:05,746 --> 02:52:07,546
[SPEAKER_27]: Put it on a string and wear it around your neck.

2282
02:52:07,946 --> 02:52:10,206
[SPEAKER_27]: That's the only way I don't lose things is to wear it around my neck.

2283
02:52:10,246 --> 02:52:11,607
[SPEAKER_27]: That's what I have to do with my work badge.

2284
02:52:11,947 --> 02:52:17,348
[SPEAKER_27]: If I did not wear my work badge around my damn neck, I would lose it.

2285
02:52:17,668 --> 02:52:21,169
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't care if I look stupid wearing my work badge around my neck or I look like a girl or something.

2286
02:52:21,629 --> 02:52:24,950
[SPEAKER_27]: I've never lost the damn thing and I've never had to pay the $10 replacement fee.

2287
02:52:25,010 --> 02:52:25,550
[SPEAKER_27]: So there you have it.

2288
02:52:25,610 --> 02:52:26,951
[SPEAKER_27]: If you don't want to lose it, wear it around your neck.

2289
02:52:28,671 --> 02:52:28,951
[SPEAKER_27]: Agree?

2290
02:52:29,051 --> 02:52:29,471
[SPEAKER_27]: Disagree?

2291
02:52:30,992 --> 02:52:31,472
[SPEAKER_27]: No comment?

2292
02:52:31,652 --> 02:52:33,532
[SPEAKER_26]: Put a giant freaking chain on it.

2293
02:52:34,473 --> 02:52:34,933
[SPEAKER_26]: Duct tape!

2294
02:52:34,953 --> 02:52:36,373
[SPEAKER_21]: Duct tape it to your forehead.

2295
02:52:36,913 --> 02:52:38,254
[SPEAKER_21]: You will never lose it again.

2296
02:52:38,714 --> 02:52:41,174
[SPEAKER_21]: Also, when you pull the duct tape off, you'll have big red welts.

2297
02:52:42,395 --> 02:52:42,835
[SPEAKER_27]: Go welts.

2298
02:52:44,471 --> 02:52:46,592
[SPEAKER_27]: Whoops, that actually wasn't supposed to be a question on air.

2299
02:52:46,612 --> 02:52:47,513
[SPEAKER_27]: That was a question to me.

2300
02:52:48,633 --> 02:52:49,874
[SPEAKER_27]: That was a private question to me.

2301
02:52:51,555 --> 02:53:01,240
[SPEAKER_27]: For those of you that like to have private conversations with a host during the show, that's fine and good, but just keep in mind if we're in the middle of a segment where I'm soliciting private messages, you might get caught in the middle.

2302
02:53:02,001 --> 02:53:02,581
[SPEAKER_27]: Just a warning.

2303
02:53:03,743 --> 02:53:11,769
[SPEAKER_27]: It's a good thing he didn't send something that says like, oh man, I just cheated on somebody or I don't know, whatever it is.

2304
02:53:12,630 --> 02:53:14,171
[SPEAKER_27]: I go and read that all the time.

2305
02:53:14,371 --> 02:53:16,512
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh my god, I secretly read Britney Spears.

2306
02:53:16,532 --> 02:53:23,237
[SPEAKER_26]: Hey, remember that one time that Ryan's girlfriend called in for Ryan and Ryan wasn't here and she, you know.

2307
02:53:24,178 --> 02:53:25,939
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, I just shot myself in the foot.

2308
02:53:26,079 --> 02:53:26,400
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah.

2309
02:53:28,300 --> 02:53:33,306
[SPEAKER_27]: OMGitsDoobz wants to know, why do all goths think they are vampires?

2310
02:53:33,986 --> 02:53:35,708
[SPEAKER_27]: That is bullshit, okay?

2311
02:53:35,768 --> 02:53:36,669
[SPEAKER_21]: That is bullshit.

2312
02:53:37,210 --> 02:53:39,212
[SPEAKER_26]: Some of them think they're succubuses.

2313
02:53:40,213 --> 02:53:41,374
[SPEAKER_21]: Succubi, thank you.

2314
02:53:41,434 --> 02:53:42,716
[SPEAKER_26]: Succubi, whatever.

2315
02:53:43,617 --> 02:53:45,699
[SPEAKER_21]: I have never once thought I was a vampire.

2316
02:53:46,240 --> 02:53:47,721
[SPEAKER_27]: Or a succubus.

2317
02:53:47,821 --> 02:53:49,003
[SPEAKER_27]: Some of them think they're...

2318
02:53:49,543 --> 02:53:50,924
[SPEAKER_21]: Free!

2319
02:53:51,165 --> 02:53:54,547
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, you need to drop that, because that is old joke, okay?

2320
02:53:59,492 --> 02:54:00,453
[SPEAKER_26]: Why is it so funny?

2321
02:54:00,533 --> 02:54:00,973
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't know.

2322
02:54:01,073 --> 02:54:02,935
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, because she's a fat cow, that's why.

2323
02:54:04,676 --> 02:54:11,302
[SPEAKER_27]: Of course, for those that don't remember, this is dating back to the old LiveJournal community on LiveJournal.

2324
02:54:11,502 --> 02:54:16,245
[SPEAKER_21]: This is just more of a case of people making fun of what they don't understand.

2325
02:54:16,665 --> 02:54:19,067
[SPEAKER_26]: She could become a fat cow like that.

2326
02:54:19,307 --> 02:54:22,849
[SPEAKER_21]: No, the stupid bitch deserved it because she really was an idiot.

2327
02:54:23,449 --> 02:54:28,272
[SPEAKER_21]: But I'm referring to this whole, oh, let's make fun of everybody who's goth or whatever.

2328
02:54:28,632 --> 02:54:29,193
[SPEAKER_21]: You know what?

2329
02:54:30,077 --> 02:54:33,919
[SPEAKER_21]: Don't poke fun at what you don't understand because it just makes you look like a big weirdo.

2330
02:54:33,939 --> 02:54:35,699
[SPEAKER_27]: Why do all DDR players think they're Asian?

2331
02:54:36,219 --> 02:54:37,420
[SPEAKER_27]: I can ask the same thing.

2332
02:54:37,440 --> 02:54:37,500
[SPEAKER_21]: See?

2333
02:54:37,620 --> 02:54:38,300
[SPEAKER_21]: And they don't.

2334
02:54:38,620 --> 02:54:39,141
[SPEAKER_21]: Exactly.

2335
02:54:39,261 --> 02:54:44,883
[SPEAKER_26]: Unless they happen to... Hey, honestly, I'm defending the goths here, okay?

2336
02:54:45,023 --> 02:54:47,764
[SPEAKER_26]: SuicideGirls.com is fucking hot, okay?

2337
02:54:48,164 --> 02:54:50,065
[SPEAKER_26]: Those goth chicks... Shut up, shut up, shut up.

2338
02:54:51,125 --> 02:54:53,147
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, now he has more questions here.

2339
02:54:53,728 --> 02:54:59,653
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, and why is Paris Hilton so famous for making a porn video?

2340
02:55:00,094 --> 02:55:05,398
[SPEAKER_27]: I wish I could get a girl famous for having sex with me, just so I can say, do me, there's a future in it.

2341
02:55:09,442 --> 02:55:09,983
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, yeah.

2342
02:55:10,503 --> 02:55:12,165
[SPEAKER_27]: Do me, there's a future in it.

2343
02:55:13,786 --> 02:55:14,707
[SPEAKER_26]: Do me now!

2344
02:55:14,727 --> 02:55:16,709
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't know.

2345
02:55:18,183 --> 02:55:20,547
[SPEAKER_26]: Honestly, she's famous probably because she's rich.

2346
02:55:20,688 --> 02:55:21,770
[SPEAKER_26]: Because their parents are rich.

2347
02:55:22,811 --> 02:55:26,017
[SPEAKER_27]: She's famous because she blew her way to the top, literally.

2348
02:55:26,478 --> 02:55:31,427
[SPEAKER_27]: DarkTetsuya wants to know, if Konami were to make a new challenge remix, what song would you like to see?

2349
02:55:36,380 --> 02:55:37,281
[SPEAKER_27]: Cowgirl Survivor.

2350
02:55:37,321 --> 02:55:37,841
[SPEAKER_27]: No, shut up.

2351
02:55:38,342 --> 02:55:38,982
[SPEAKER_27]: Shut up right now.

2352
02:55:39,002 --> 02:55:41,765
[SPEAKER_27]: A new challenge remix.

2353
02:55:41,905 --> 02:55:42,585
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, like Oni.

2354
02:55:42,605 --> 02:55:47,449
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, remember back in Max 2 when they were trying to keep the series fresh, you know?

2355
02:55:47,650 --> 02:55:49,551
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, then I fucking want Butterfly Oni.

2356
02:55:49,751 --> 02:55:50,852
[SPEAKER_27]: No, I guess we already have that.

2357
02:55:50,872 --> 02:55:51,233
[SPEAKER_26]: You can't do that.

2358
02:55:51,253 --> 02:55:51,893
[SPEAKER_26]: It's a licensed song.

2359
02:55:52,053 --> 02:55:52,694
[SPEAKER_27]: Ah, shut up.

2360
02:55:54,916 --> 02:55:56,297
[SPEAKER_27]: Can we do Ultramix 2 stuff?

2361
02:55:57,638 --> 02:55:58,079
[SPEAKER_27]: I suppose.

2362
02:55:58,099 --> 02:55:58,819
[SPEAKER_27]: How about Gyrus?

2363
02:55:59,980 --> 02:56:00,721
[SPEAKER_26]: I guess you could do that.

2364
02:56:01,001 --> 02:56:01,521
[SPEAKER_27]: That's what I want.

2365
02:56:01,541 --> 02:56:02,042
[SPEAKER_27]: I want Gyrus.

2366
02:56:02,463 --> 02:56:06,145
[SPEAKER_26]: No, what they should honestly do is like, you know, I don't know.

2367
02:56:06,586 --> 02:56:09,908
[SPEAKER_26]: I thought the whole idea with doing those Oni remixes was a cool idea.

2368
02:56:09,928 --> 02:56:11,569
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, it kept the series fresh.

2369
02:56:11,609 --> 02:56:15,231
[SPEAKER_26]: It was like, ooh, that's kind of neat, you know, because they remixed all these songs.

2370
02:56:15,291 --> 02:56:16,632
[SPEAKER_26]: And then they just said, you know what?

2371
02:56:16,792 --> 02:56:18,173
[SPEAKER_26]: We just don't care anymore.

2372
02:56:19,794 --> 02:56:23,777
[SPEAKER_26]: Let's give them another erotic song and put some eye toy support in there.

2373
02:56:24,778 --> 02:56:25,498
[SPEAKER_26]: It won't know different.

2374
02:56:25,558 --> 02:56:26,119
[SPEAKER_26]: I'll shut them up.

2375
02:56:27,620 --> 02:56:31,222
[SPEAKER_26]: We'll change the color of the interface and then we'll tell them that we're starting over and we'll stop.

2376
02:56:34,506 --> 02:56:45,273
[SPEAKER_27]: I think it's time to put the nail in the coffin of this lovely program known as Orange Lounge Radio and this mediocre show we had tonight.

2377
02:56:45,753 --> 02:56:47,354
[SPEAKER_27]: I hope you found it to be as okay as I did.

2378
02:56:49,534 --> 02:56:52,375
[SPEAKER_27]: Download our podcast, which is sure to be ten times better.

2379
02:56:53,135 --> 02:56:53,615
[SPEAKER_27]: No, I'm kidding.

2380
02:56:54,255 --> 02:56:54,575
[SPEAKER_27]: I kid.

2381
02:56:54,675 --> 02:56:55,596
[SPEAKER_27]: Our show's awesome.

2382
02:56:55,936 --> 02:56:56,696
[SPEAKER_27]: We're the best thing ever.

2383
02:56:56,996 --> 02:56:59,197
[SPEAKER_27]: And so, you know, congratulations.

2384
02:56:59,217 --> 02:56:59,777
[SPEAKER_27]: You're a part of it.

2385
02:57:00,397 --> 02:57:06,539
[SPEAKER_27]: Final thoughts, Bradley, the loud mouth who can't shut up during our show so we can do a show here.

2386
02:57:06,579 --> 02:57:07,519
[SPEAKER_27]: Bradley, your final thought.

2387
02:57:11,520 --> 02:57:14,741
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, goodbye and good fish and all of that.

2388
02:57:15,814 --> 02:57:19,376
[SPEAKER_26]: And my final thought is, I hate myself and I want to die.

2389
02:57:43,922 --> 02:57:46,084
[SPEAKER_27]: And I gotta go get that shirt out of the dryer so I can wear it tonight.

2390
02:57:46,705 --> 02:57:48,567
[SPEAKER_26]: And I have to go back to my castle.

2391
02:57:49,788 --> 02:57:50,569
[SPEAKER_27]: DarkSakura.

2392
02:57:52,331 --> 02:57:53,252
[SPEAKER_21]: I hate my life.

2393
02:57:53,873 --> 02:57:58,278
[SPEAKER_21]: Every day I polish my revolver and I shoot my head like a rock star.

2394
02:57:59,645 --> 02:58:04,208
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright, the final word of the show, I'm taking it tonight, because I don't get the final show often enough.

2395
02:58:04,628 --> 02:58:07,310
[SPEAKER_27]: Tonight's final word, one word to sum it all up, you guys.

2396
02:58:08,691 --> 02:58:21,560

[SPEAKER_27]: Alright, the last word of the show is... Snurdy.

2398
02:58:26,778 --> 02:58:31,640
[SPEAKER_29]: That does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live.

2402
02:59:02,509 --> 02:59:29,667
[SPEAKER_10]: What a thrill With darkness and silence through the night What a thrill I'm searching and I'll melt into you What a fear in my heart But you're so supreme

2403
02:59:34,048 --> 02:59:51,392

[SPEAKER_21]: I can't do it today.

2411
