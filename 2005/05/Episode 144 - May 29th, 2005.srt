1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
It's like that y'all, but we don't quit You keep on rock shot, cause this is it

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:56,920
The following live program is a special presentation of Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:02,640
On tonight's episode of Orange Lounge Radio, episode 144, all three of us are back together

4
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,840
again for the first time in a couple weeks, and it's really the first time we're all together

5
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,520
since E3, and although you guys are probably sick of hearing about it, we're not done talking

6
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,520
about E3.

7
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,920
So we'll probably have a little bit more on that, only a little bit though, because we

8
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:23,140
have other stories to move on to tonight, including what happens when Konami puts up

9
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:26,360
a seemingly important poll.

10
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:30,520
Of course, somebody's gotta go and fuck it up for everybody else.

11
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:37,520
We'll have more after this.

12
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:09,200
AHHHoooooo

13
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:16,880
theme music

14
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:01,260
You're mentioning the oh man Senior

15
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:18,240
P

16
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:30,880
R

17
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,880
Oh, God!

18
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,880
Heh heh heh heh heh! Call me daddy!

19
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:40,880
Orange Lounge may contain adult content.

20
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:44,880
Orange Lounge may contain many four-letter words.

21
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:48,880
Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity.

22
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,880
Orange Lounge may contain plenty of...

23
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,880
...bluh-uh-bluh-truh-bluh-caw-key.

24
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:59,880
Just kidding! Orange Lounge Radio will not contain any of that in this episode.

25
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,880
Well, isn't that special?

26
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:16,880
Orange Lounge Radio Live is a fully interactive program via our website at www.orangeloungeradio.com

27
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:24,880
And now, here are your hosts for Orange Lounge Radio Live, Dark Sakura, Skye, and Loki

28
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:37,120
We are live, and this is episode number 144 for this May the 29th of 2005.

29
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,600
You're tuned in to Orange Lounge Radio, radio that gamers really want, and this is Orange

30
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:46,600
Lounge Radio Live, your home for all the news and discussion on rhythm and music games as

31
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:50,300
well as the gamer community and the pop culture world.

32
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:56,620
We're plugged in and fully interactive through our website at www.orangeloungeradio.com.

33
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:57,620
My name is Rob Roberts.

34
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:58,620
You might know me as Sky.

35
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:02,700
Joining me, as always, are my awesome co-hosts in this corner, the Happiest Bunny on the

36
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,700
Farm.

37
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,540
Say hello to Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

38
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:09,300
Yo, what up?

39
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,300
What is up?

40
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:18,360
I just happened to be peeking through random news and apparently they're taking a vigilante

41
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,220
justice against online scam fight.

42
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:23,340
I've heard about that and that's almost worth talking about a little later tonight.

43
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:23,840
I agree.

44
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,380
The intro does say we don't have to just talk about rhythm and music games.

45
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:30,620
This is why we changed my little script here in the beginning,

46
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:33,900
because now we can talk about the pop culture world when we feel like it.

47
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:34,780
And we do.

48
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:35,080
Yeah.

49
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:35,580
Often.

50
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:36,080
Orange Lounge.

51
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,380
How does that stop this before?

52
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:38,380
Hey, I haven't introduced you yet.

53
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:38,880
Be quiet.

54
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,460
Yeah.

55
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:42,780
You're not here until we introduce you.

56
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:46,020
Not that Orange Lounge Radio doesn't ever get random anyway.

57
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,020
But that's random.

58
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,060
That's why people know us.

59
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,100
That's what we do a lot of.

60
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:49,660
All right.

61
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:52,540
let me introduce the one and only tech master loki

62
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,020
i don't want to talk now

63
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:55,340
oh i see how it is

64
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:56,940
you're going to be like that huh?

65
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,780
exactly

66
00:04:58,780 --> 00:04:59,700
fine whatever

67
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:03,980
all right uh... we should have uh... it's going to be a mediocre show tonight

68
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:08,140
i don't know it'll be a slightly average

69
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:11,300
it'll be a five out of ten show tonight i think

70
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,980
my burps are five out of ten

71
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:17,660
no we we have some fun stuff for you guys we actually have some kind of premiers for you

72
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:18,900
guys tonight

73
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:32,900
This is going to be an interesting trend here on Orange Lawn Radio. Last week we were the first to play for you guys the Polopsian dance, I don't even remember the name of it now, whatever, and then the bootleg of Jelly Kiss that Loki took from E3.

74
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:40,900
And it's going to continue tonight. A brand new UltraMix 3 song that wasn't even in the demo was announced this week. We're going to play that for you guys.

75
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:45,900
And we're going to play, um, some of you guys have probably heard this by now, but we're going to play it anyway.

76
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:51,900
We're going to play Waver, one of the new songs from Songpack 11, which is in Silent Hill as well.

77
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,900
I hope it's not the weird remix.

78
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,900
It is a very weird song.

79
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:58,900
It's not that freaky remix that was on the...

80
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,900
I think so. I think it is.

81
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,900
Ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.

82
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:07,900
It's related to Dead DDR, so we have to give it its three seconds of glory.

83
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:13,900
Alright, it's one of Megalotov's favorites too, so if he heard you saying this, he'd probably cry.

84
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:20,900
No, I didn't like it. I like the original. And I hate the Urine remix too.

85
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,900
Well, we're not playing the Urine remix yet.

86
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:23,900
Thank God.

87
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:27,900
I don't know, maybe at the end of the show just for you. We'll see.

88
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,900
Alright, so we got all that fun stuff coming up.

89
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:34,900
And, if you want to, I have some of the Dancing Stage Unleashed 2 tracks.

90
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:40,820
track. Oh yes, we have to do some of those as well. Dancing Stage Unleashed 2. And, and,

91
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:46,560
and that song that I brought that's sorta kinda, it's borderline remixed. It's the Metal

92
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,320
Gear Acid song, right? Yeah. Oh, we gotta hear that. I think a lot of our fanboys and

93
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:56,140
fangirls would appreciate that. They would like to hear it, and it's not quite a remix.

94
00:06:56,140 --> 00:07:01,440
I kinda thought about remixing it, and I'm kinda on, you know. Way to hype it up. Way

95
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,680
hype it up it's really awesome i just you know that i mean it's one of those songs that's so

96
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,800
awesome it's like you know i don't know if i want to touch it because i don't want to make it worse

97
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,960
than it is see what i mean about tonight being a real just average show because loki's just like

98
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:20,720
yeah i got this song it's okay it is never average damn it you're supposed to make it

99
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:27,200
all right i know well i know i always look good and you're looking okay with that haircut you're

100
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,200
You're looking average.

101
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,200
My haircut looks like it sucks.

102
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,200
Loki, you look okay.

103
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,400
Actually, Loki, you're a little bit below average, but luckily I'm here to bring you

104
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,400
up.

105
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,880
My haircut is bad.

106
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,800
Ah, no, I like the haircut.

107
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,800
It's too short.

108
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,120
But it's very, very red.

We'll be back after this break featuring just some potpourri, a potpourri of Bomani music

111
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:55,160
for you guys, starting it off with some Rainbow Flyer, because I haven't heard that song in

112
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,280
a while and I like that one.

113
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:00,760
Remember 2DX8-style Rainbow Flyer? It's cute.

114
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:07,760
and we have knocking at the door so we'll figure that one out and we'll be back after this

115
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:50,760
Today, I'll be talking about my life in the city, yeah

116
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:56,760
Today, I'll be talking about my life in the city with you

that orangeloungeradio.com.

120
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,760
It's 5.38.

121
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:47,760
No it's not.

122
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:51,960
Damn it, I hate it when I do that.

123
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:52,960
Orange Lounge Radio.

124
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:53,960
We're on the...

125
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:54,960
2.

126
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:55,960
What?

127
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,960
Really buzzed the shit out of me.

128
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,960
I really, I have screwed up the show so much.

129
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,960
You know, it's just, it's okay.

130
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,960
But it's an okay show.

131
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,960
Next week we're replacing Rob with a tuna.

132
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,960
Seriously, the tuna might do better.

133
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:08,960
That's the sad thing.

134
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,960
No, here's the thing.

135
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,960
Next week, Rob will become a stapler.

136
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,960
Next week, the role of Rob will be played by Rob.

137
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,960
Hey, okay, that's enough.

138
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:22,960
The weird thing is, like, I queued up the pre-show extra long tonight

139
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:26,340
long tonight because usually what we do, this is the whole

140
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:27,640
idea behind the pre-show.

141
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:30,860
We have the pre-show go at 5.30 so that it gives you time

142
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:33,240
to connect to the station so that you don't get dumped

143
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,800
right before we go live.

144
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,960
See, it's kind of like to draw you in because we have to,

145
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,480
when we go from the basic broadcast to live, we have to

146
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,480
dump all the listeners to do that, right?

147
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:44,120
So we go live with a pre-show at 5.30.

148
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,840
Well, tonight we actually went live at 4 because we're having

149
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,240
an Orange Lounge staff meeting.

150
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,480
Very important stuff, by the way.

151
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:52,200
Very important stuff at the Orange Lounge staff meetings.

152
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:52,840
Very important.

153
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:53,720
Onion flavored.

154
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,720
Yes.

155
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:58,640
Never any alcoholic drinks at the Orange Laundry radio staff meetings ever.

156
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:01,080
Just onions.

157
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:03,040
So I queued it up to start at four.

158
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,320
So I had the whole playlist in my player program ready to go.

159
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,760
And I started it at the top of the list.

160
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:12,720
Well, the problem was that the top of my screen wasn't really the top of the list.

161
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,280
So I actually started at four o'clock, what was supposed to be at 4.30.

162
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:20,000
And so everything ran like a half hour early, which caused a great panic when we

163
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,880
got home from the staff meeting and I realized, oh, crap.

164
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:27,320
The pre-show's almost over, but it's only 6 o'clock.

165
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:28,920
One of many ways I'm screwing up tonight.

166
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,040
Yeah, thank you, chat room.

167
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,600
Chat room's saying, fire for me.

168
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,480
Thank you.

169
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,720
Appreciate that.

170
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,320
Speaking of chat room, www.orangeloungeradio.com.

171
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,120
Click on Chat.

172
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:41,880
You should join us.

173
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,800
It's always a happy, skippy, good time.

174
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,760
We have a special guest who joined us there during the

175
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,640
first break as well.

176
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,720
Can we get him a microphone?

177
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,960
Do I have to give him mine here?

178
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,640
The one and only RKDN42, ladies and gentlemen.

179
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,640
Hello.

180
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,640
How are you doing?

181
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,640
I'm doing okay.

182
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,640
My computer is not.

183
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,640
That's why I'm here.

184
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,640
Wow.

185
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,320
I'm liking this new studio because on the new mic you're actually really loud.

186
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,320
All right.

187
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,320
Which is good.

188
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,320
Awesome.

189
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,400
I think he's loud only because we broke the mic.

190
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,000
Maybe.

191
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,920
You gotta watch the yelling tonight, Loki, because you might blow out somebody's speakers.

192
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:13,920
Oh, no.

193
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,920
I'll just get the story to Beyond All Hell.

194
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:21,920
Yeah, I mean, because obviously you can't get louder than this, you know, that it's set to go. So, whatever.

195
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:33,920
All right. We are going to get into How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day, but first I think it's very important that we do an Orange Lounge Radio news update, because this is big news. This is really big news.

196
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,920
La la.

197
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,920
Hey, this isn't a music update.

198
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:41,920
Orange Lounge Radio news update.

199
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,920
You are too loud.

200
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:52,060
actually we're all too loud effective may 28th ish 28 earlier this week

201
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:58,420
effective earlier this week both dark Sakura and I have quit Final Fantasy 11

202
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:03,260
yes we have got up and left and quit for good

203
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:10,420
yes good Britain leaving hey screw off leaving poor Loki all by himself in the

204
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:15,460
world of an ideal and he's enjoying every second of it yeah screw off yeah

205
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:19,940
but we have PS opium to keep us happy you know what and it's weird because I'm

206
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:24,940
not even that into bluebirds like it's cool and all but let's face it Jamie

207
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:32,180
it's freaking PSO again I like for the fourth time yeah but I can play it while

208
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:35,540
doing my homework and actually get to a different window but Jamie did they give

209
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:41,400
us new classes? No. Did they give us new skins for our characters? No. Did they give us the

210
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:46,880
type of voice support that Xbox Live had? No. Eventually. Eventually? They're working

211
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:52,540
on it. Okay, well we don't have it yet, so not yet, okay? The only cool thing about PSO

212
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:56,900
Blue Burst so far, other than the fact that it is PSO, and PSO is a pretty decent game,

213
00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:01,900
you can play it in a window. So I can talk on aim. You can, feasibly, you can cybersex

214
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:05,460
and play PSO at the same time, if you're into that. Not that I would know anything about

215
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:06,460
that.

216
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:07,460
Me neither.

217
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:08,460
But I'm just saying.

218
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:13,120
Well, you can do that with Final Fantasy II. In fact, you can actually play two sessions

219
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:17,060
of Final Fantasy at the same time. I don't know why you'd want to, but you could.

220
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:19,140
The one on the PlayStation 2, the one on the PC.

221
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:20,140
Knows who on the PC.

222
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:26,820
Well, maybe that's for, like, husband and wife living together who both want to play.

223
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:27,820
No, it's for hackers.

224
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:38,820
Anywho, basically Warner solidified my not joining up with Matrix online because they killed off Morpheus.

225
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:45,820
I heard about that, but I mean, you know, and a lot of people go, how can they kill Morpheus?

226
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:50,820
Well, easy. Here's how you can kill Morpheus because you can make him come back, just like they're going to make Neo come back.

227
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:54,820
Well, and then the other thing is that what are you worried about, a new movie?

228
00:20:54,820 --> 00:21:00,660
not gonna happen sorry I I know this is a new slash anybody but the third

229
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:04,600
matrix movie sucked therefore there will not be any more matrix movie actually

230
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:08,980
correction the second movie sucked the third movie was just kind of let's face

231
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:16,540
it as a whole it sucked yeah it's kind of like tonight's show it's yeah it's

232
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:21,340
average yes but that but but Rob but what we've all all of his movies suck

233
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:23,540
Yet, for some reason, they keep making them.

234
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:25,340
Eh? Eh?

235
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:29,740
Warner Brothers? I mean, come on, the Matrix franchise makes more money than Catwoman.

236
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:31,340
Eh, whatever.

237
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:36,540
Uh, comment from our chatroom there. I'm apparently pissing off some of the Final Fantasy XI fans with my, uh...

238
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:41,740
Damn straight! But see, here's what the kicker is, because he gave me all of his stuff, and he's like,

239
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:45,340
Don't sell this, because I might come back. First thing I did is sold all of it.

240
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:47,340
Ass.

241
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:55,100
And no one, you know, people wonder why I didn't get rid of my stuff, gave my stuff

242
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,100
away.

243
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,100
I just quit.

244
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,100
That's fine.

245
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,100
That's fine.

246
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:01,460
Because when I come back, they'll have PVP.

247
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:02,660
I'm never coming back.

248
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:03,660
I've decided.

249
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:04,660
Okay.

250
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:05,660
But here's the thing.

251
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:10,660
Somebody jaded 2005 saying, PSO and Final Fantasy, both are good, so don't quit one

252
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:12,260
and go solely to another.

253
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:14,780
I'm actually not solely playing Phantasy Star online.

254
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:16,860
I'm also playing Guild Wars.

255
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:20,860
And I'm going to be quitting all of it when Ragnarok 2 comes out.

256
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:24,980
Actually, here's the idea behind it.

257
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:29,820
Guild Wars, a lot of my friends are into right now, and I basically got bullied into checking

258
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:30,820
it out.

259
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:33,660
And I do like the idea that you don't have to pay a monthly fee.

260
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:35,320
I got to admit, that's a big draw.

261
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:40,340
Because Final Fantasy XI, here I am paying $15.95 a month for three characters I'm never

262
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:41,340
going to use.

263
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:42,340
Right?

264
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:44,100
Or I haven't been using for the past two months.

265
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,640
Why do you have three characters?

266
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:51,320
I had, because everybody knows in order to play Final Fantasy 11, if you want to be good,

267
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,460
eventually you're going to have to have a mule.

268
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:55,840
You can get through the first 30 levels with no mule, but eventually you're going to have

269
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:56,840
to have a mule for all your crap.

270
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:57,840
I had two of them.

271
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,840
Yeah, exactly.

272
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,820
And I was in, what, 18?

273
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:05,380
So I had my main character, my mule, and then I had a character on another server, because

274
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:08,820
you can't server hop in Final Fantasy 11, so once you're on one server you're stuck

275
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:09,820
on it.

276
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:15,180
So somebody who I've been getting to know lately happens to have a level 75 character

277
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:18,420
and really wants to play with me except he's on another server well he quit the

278
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:22,680
game too anyway so it doesn't really matter so it's just one of those things

279
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:27,240
where it's like I've been playing it since October of 2003 I'm sick of logging

280
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:31,280
on to the game every day just to farm it because the economy is all fucked up

281
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,820
because they won't do anything about the guild sellers I'm done I'm not having

282
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:39,620
fun with the game anymore it's just I'm sorry am I is Final Fantasy 11 a bad

283
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:43,660
game no it's one of the best MMOs I've ever played but it's unfortunately just

284
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:48,500
kinda starting to go down the tubes in my eyes. I'm just not interested in it anymore.

285
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:54,100
There's probably things on there that still interest other people. I, for one, am done.

286
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:59,900
I met some great people on Final Fantasy XI, though.

287
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:03,840
You know, I just didn't have, you know, and I don't like that you're pretty much forced

288
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:07,540
to play with other people, because that pisses me the fuck off.

289
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:11,540
Who'd want to interact with other people? In an online game.

290
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:19,540
Well, no, the thing I liked about Ragnarok and PSO is that I could solo all I wanted

291
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:22,740
to, and if I wanted to interact with other people, I could.

292
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:26,940
Final Fantasy XI forces you to interact with other people.

293
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:27,940
Yeah.

294
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:30,900
But I don't like that at all.

295
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:34,780
Well, see, that never bothered me because, you know, it's an MMO.

296
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:36,880
You kind of expect that, so.

297
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,100
But I understand what you're saying.

298
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:41,300
Guild Wars, you can play by yourself or you can play with other people.

299
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:43,620
World of Warcraft, that's a big draw for those people too.

300
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:44,620
Alright, anyway.

301
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:49,180
Sorry, oh yeah, we talk about rhythm and music games on the show once in a while, don't we?

302
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:52,780
How was your week, how was your day, Dr. Sakura?

303
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:59,220
My week was busy, and they changed my entire function at work, so I'm having to remember

304
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:07,860
shit from three years ago that has changed since then, and it's just a big freaking pain

305
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:08,860
in the ass.

306
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:18,860
On top of that, I'm still without my car. Dan tried to hammer my fender back into shape, and tore off my tire cover to try to get it to where I could drive it.

307
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:23,860
Now my alignment is off to where when my wheel is straight, I turn rather sharply to the left.

308
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:25,860
Do you have a donut car? That's awesome.

309
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:27,860
A car that does donuts.

310
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:28,860
Oh, yeah.

311
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:33,860
So my car is no longer considered safe to drive, and I may be buying a new car, which is kind of cool.

312
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:37,860
Sorry, Loki, just had me thinking of a car made out of donuts.

313
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:40,860
The Twinbee is being retired!

314
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:43,860
It has been stomped on by the great salamander cult.

315
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:46,860
Known as the stupid taxi driver company.

316
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:51,860
Of course, there was E3 last week.

317
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:53,860
In Disneyland.

318
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:54,860
In my sunburn.

319
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:57,860
Oh, that's right, you weren't here for last week's show, so we haven't really heard-

320
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:58,860
Heck no! I was tired!

321
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:01,860
We haven't really heard your E3 perspective yet.

322
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:04,860
Oh, they did if they listened to the podcast.

323
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:08,840
Which a lot of freaking people did this week, by the way.

324
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,380
Not just this current week, but all previous weeks.

325
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:14,760
We got big exposure on this ipodr.org site.

326
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:17,760
Adam Curry posted about us.

327
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,760
That's cool.

328
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,320
I love his hair.

329
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,160
And he's one name away from Tim Curry, so that's even cooler.

330
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,960
That's very cool.

331
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:29,560
And that's also one name away from Adam West, which makes it like top of cool.

332
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,680
And his name is also a delicious dish.

333
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,720
Sorry, you're weak.

334
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:42,000
Another notable thing that happened this week is the release of Demon Days, Guilas.

335
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,520
Which made me very happy because I have the UK and the US version now, which is the same

336
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,520
damn thing!

337
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:51,320
And of course, I was a big dumbass and didn't cancel one of my things at the time, so I

338
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,320
have them both.

339
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,240
It's like a Game Boy.

340
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,240
I guess?

341
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,240
Totally.

342
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,240
It's like, her buying Demon Days is like a Game Boy.

343
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:02,280
It's like she got the same damn thing, but just like different shrink wrap colors.

344
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:15,280
They're actually exactly the same, so the way that I have to tell the difference apart on them is because they have big fold over covers in each direction so you can have one of their faces on the front, so one of them has Murdock and the other one has 2D.

345
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:27,280
I've been Squealy Fangirl. And my Japanese EP arrived for Feel Good Inc. and it has a bunch of songs on it, so I'm very happy. Been in happy fangirl mode lately.

346
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:31,280
If I'm done.

347
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:34,280
Loki, should we make bets on when she gets burned out on it?

348
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,280
As if.

349
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:40,280
I don't care. Alright. Loki, how was your week? How was your day?

350
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:45,280
I watched a ton of movies this week, none of which were any good.

351
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:52,280
I started off with watching the original Star Wars trilogy because I have to get rid of the five movies out of the way

352
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:55,900
before nellie will go see the third movie and i want to see the third movie

353
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:57,580
but you know i'm not like

354
00:27:57,580 --> 00:28:00,100
who i have to go see right away so

355
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:11,060
so what's the original

356
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:12,600
do it all the crap

357
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:16,300
i'm very sorry i'll copy might as well for you know i don't want to trust me

358
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:17,640
i don't want

359
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:20,620
you have to cap i i don't care i don't really care because

360
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:27,620
No amount of crap added or subtracted from the last episode six, man.

361
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:31,820
What were they thinking, Ewoks? Come on. That was the most retarded thing.

362
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:36,020
It was little Asian teddy bears that were attacking everything.

363
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:37,020
It was like a goddamn nightmare.

364
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:38,660
Yeah, Jedi was my favorite of them.

365
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:42,500
It should have been Domo-Kun. Oh my god, that would have been actually cool.

366
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:45,740
Let me put my Star Wars fandom into perspective for you all, okay?

367
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:49,980
I got invited to a Star Wars marathon last night where they were going to watch the original

368
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:54,020
trilogy in the original, like, I don't know, the good form or whatever you guys call it,

369
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:58,620
back to back to back. And, you know, it was going to be fun, and there's going to be,

370
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:02,180
you know, food and stuff, and it was with some of my really, really good friends, and

371
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:07,380
I said, no, I don't want to fucking watch Star Wars again. That is my Star Wars fandom,

372
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:08,380
ladies and gentlemen.

373
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:12,740
I actually really do want to go put in my laser just so I can get the bad taste of episodes

374
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:14,020
one and two out of my mouth.

375
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:18,260
Let me just put it this way, I mean, it was, first off, Yoda was really strange looking

376
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:22,900
as a puppet, and that was the best part, because it was just like, it was like The Muppets.

377
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:27,700
That's what it reminded me of, The Muppets. And the whole Ewok thing was just retarded.

378
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:32,460
It's just, I was like, why the hell did he do this? I just wanted, I just kept making

379
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:36,680
fun of the movie the entire time. And then, um, so anyways, watch that. And then today

380
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:42,540
for some reason I watched, um, Running Man. And the best part about that, and I didn't

381
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:47,780
even realize it, is Richard Dawson is the goddamn host of Running Man. He realized the

382
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:52,980
the average age of our listeners. Okay, okay. Richard Dawson was the guy that used to be

383
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:58,860
part of Match Game and he was also part of the family feud. Back in the day, okay, he

384
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:03,300
was actually a good host. He's pretty funny. But I just didn't realize, I'm like, dude,

385
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:07,860
that's Richard Dawson. That's awesome. And then for some reason I watched Wild Wild West,

386
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:13,380
or at least part of it, and that movie is Racist as Hell. I mean, they're just like,

387
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:17,580
you know, throwing racist jokes back and forth throughout the entire movie. One movie? Wild

388
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:24,100
Wild West. That old one with Will Smith from a few years ago? It's fucking racist as hell.

389
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:28,580
Like they're just making like, you know, the one guy calls him a coon, the other guy, basically

390
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:32,820
the one, you know, villain that doesn't have legs anymore, got his legs cut off or something,

391
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:36,780
so Will Smith makes fun of him for being, you know, crippled, and then, you know, the

392
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:42,260
other guy makes fun of him for being, you know, a black person. And so, that was really

393
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:45,820
interesting. Oh, that's nice. Oh yeah, that's so nice. Anyways, so besides all the movies,

394
00:30:45,820 --> 00:31:01,820
Um, actually, the week was okay, I've been just doing more work stuff, um, no game accounts and whatnot, and um, then I was playing Final Fantasy XI, I'm level 58 now, I'm my black mage, and that's awesome.

395
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:07,820
And that's pretty much it, as far as, you know, gaming and stuff goes.

396
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:11,820
I was so bored today at Nellie's parents' house, because they had their family over,

397
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:14,820
that I was actually playing cell phone game Worms.

398
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:21,820
And for some reason, the AI always commits suicide, and I don't know why.

399
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:23,820
That's all.

400
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:26,820
All right. Bradley, how was your recession?

401
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:29,820
Actually, before I forget, I was at Dimple, by the way,

402
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:33,820
I found another guitar with something or the other, but I forgot what it was.

403
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:36,820
That's okay.

404
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:39,820
Bradley, how was your week? How was your day?

405
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:43,820
Our week was alright. Work went pretty fast this week.

406
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:48,820
Sometimes it was really slow. This week actually felt like it went pretty fast.

407
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:54,820
And then, yay, this weekend is the first full three-day weekend I get for the year.

408
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:56,820
This is good.

409
00:31:56,820 --> 00:32:01,820
And then today, I was playing on the computer and it stopped. It went off.

410
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:08,820
That was because the power supply at Fan-In had been bad for the past year or so.

411
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:12,820
And then it finally decided to stop and then it burned itself out.

412
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:15,820
So I had to go to Fries and pick up a new one and put that in.

413
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:25,820
And then when I tried to restart it, the network driver, the number card driver died for some reason.

414
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:30,820
So it wanted me to reinstall, but my floppy disk drive doesn't work anymore.

415
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:33,820
It's been dead for two or three years.

416
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:37,820
So I came over here so you can see if they would...

417
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:40,820
Rob would burn me a disk or something.

418
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:42,820
And that all happened.

419
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:43,820
And that's about all.

420
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:47,820
I played Devil May Cry because I've only played a little bit of that.

421
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:52,820
And that's one of the games I got when I bought the PS2 from Jamie's friend.

422
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:56,220
I hardly ever played it, didn't, I only played like the first level until now.

423
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:59,540
That's it. Alrighty.

424
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:03,180
My week and my day. Um, I went TV shopping yesterday because

425
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:06,900
you know how sometimes when you have extra money it's like, oh damn, I got, I got

426
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:09,500
money to burn right now. I gotta buy something. So I,

427
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:14,480
I had this urge to go out and buy a new TV. Because my credit card's at a zero

428
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:17,780
balance right now, so I'm like, I can afford to buy something nice for myself.

429
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:21,020
So I went to go look at TVs. I really couldn't find

430
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:24,860
anything that seemed worthwhile to me

431
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:28,140
because I think we're at this real phase in televisions right now where like

432
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:30,380
we're on the verge of HDTV

433
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:33,540
to come out like really really soon

434
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:37,940
but the problem is that HDTVs are still like way too expensive

435
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:42,900
like they have like somewhat reasonable HDTVs for like I don't know $600 or

436
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:43,300
something

437
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:47,060
but it seemed like one of those kinds that would break after a year

438
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:49,460
and I don't want to buy a TV if it's just gonna break after a year

439
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:54,160
And then the problem is, and I think this is why people are afraid to go up to HDTV,

440
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:59,060
there's too damn many types of TVs. There's the widescreen, and there's the plasma,

441
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:02,860
and there's the projection, and the LCD, and then there's 4x3s.

442
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:07,460
It is too overwhelming, and I consider myself somewhat technically inclined.

443
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:11,960
I mean, I know how to, you know, do a radio show on the internet with friends, you know,

444
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:16,860
but I can't figure out what TV I want. Is that freaking sad, or what?

445
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:20,860
Stop watching TV. Just download it all on your computer.

446
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:24,860
But see, this is the thing. I'm not buying a TV for TV.

447
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:28,860
I'm buying a TV for my DVDs and games. Laser pointer for iPod?

448
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:32,860
No, I'm not getting a laser pointer for iPod.

449
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:36,860
No, I'm sorry. This just...anyway.

450
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:40,860
You know, we actually are going to be buying a...we want to get a widescreen TV.

451
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:44,860
You know what all I'm going to use it for? Video games.

452
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:49,260
And Dan's all like, I can watch this movie, I can watch this movie.

453
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:51,920
We haven't discussed a single TV show.

454
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:57,780
All he watches is that 70s show, and all I watch is basically all day watching him play

455
00:34:57,780 --> 00:35:03,240
Fire Emblem.

456
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:08,280
Here's the thing is that, sure, I could tell by walking in there which one of those TVs

457
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,520
was the prettiest TV.

458
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:15,860
Of course, that huge 52-inch widescreen LCD plasma super duper HDTV was obviously the

459
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:17,100
best one.

460
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:24,740
But let's face it, boys and girls, I'm doing a radio show on the Internet, not on New York

461
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:25,740
over-the-air radio.

462
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:30,640
I don't quite have a lot of money to spend on nice TVs.

463
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:34,100
So I have to find something that's in the middle somewhere where it's a nice TV but

464
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:35,100
affordable.

465
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:37,700
And I think just right now is a bad time for TVs because I think they're going to come

466
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:39,020
down in price by the end of the year.

467
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:42,840
At least that's what I hope, is that there'll be a price war this Christmas, and they'll

468
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:43,840
come down.

469
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:46,280
I even saw a story on Yahoo the other day, it said they were going to come down in price

470
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,280
soon enough.

471
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:56,200
All right, anyway, so instead of getting the TV, I ended up buying a DVD kit for my Xbox

472
00:35:56,200 --> 00:36:01,200
because it's just a long story about the setup of our house, but I needed one, trust me.

473
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:06,160
And F Microsoft for having to, you have to buy a DVD kit to turn your Xbox into a DVD

474
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,500
player, that sucks.

475
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:10,680
But I must admit it is a very nice DVD player, because you can do Zoom and all that stuff,

476
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:11,680
so it's cool.

477
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:17,320
I also picked up Fable for the Xbox, because it's on sale, so it's not $50 now, it's only

478
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,560
$30, so I figured what the hell, I'll pick it up.

479
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,080
And it's kind of fun.

480
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:25,840
It's the only video game I've played in a long time where I can truly aspire to be a

481
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:29,360
gay whore, and maybe succeed at it.

482
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:32,040
I don't know, it's still too early, I'm only two hours into it.

483
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:35,040
So we'll see.

484
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:38,040
That was pretty much my week in my day, was yesterday shopping.

485
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:40,960
Going back to work this week was good, because I got to get back

486
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:41,760
into the swing of things.

487
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,440
And it was kind of refreshing, believe it or not, to go back to

488
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:47,080
work after being in LA for a week, just out of

489
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:47,880
place and everything.

490
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:48,760
So it was nice.

491
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,680
Anyway.

492
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:54,760
Let's move on to some Bamani-related things.

493
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:58,160
We are going to do a premiere of a brand new DDR

494
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,840
UltraMix III song.

495
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:03,480
Funny enough, go figure, this is a song that originally

496
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:09,480
showed up in our cage match and if you might remember DDR Ultra Mix 2 we

497
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:12,840
called three of those songs in our cage match before they were ever announced we

498
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:16,240
had no inside knowledge or anything but we played After All by Delirium the

499
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:20,120
Svensson and Gielin mix we played the right mix in our cage match once and we

500
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:24,760
played Wherever You Are by Lava in our cage match once and that was in and then

501
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:29,440
what was the other one I'm in Heaven, Jason Evans and Holly James also showed up in

502
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,880
in DDR.

503
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:34,040
So maybe our cage matches were something after all.

504
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,540
So tune in tonight, because there might be

505
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:36,920
a new DDR song in it.

506
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,400
Anyway, here's this new song that's

507
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,080
announced for DDR UltraMix III.

508
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:43,040
It was not in the E3 demo.

509
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,600
It was actually announced by the artist himself on his

510
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,000
website, our old buddy Midi Head, who we interviewed a

511
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:48,560
little while ago.

512
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,100
We've got to get him back on the show, because he's got not

513
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:53,440
only this, but he's got the Jelly Kiss remix.

514
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:56,480
And he said on his site that there is

515
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,800
something else as well.

516
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:03,440
So, here it is, Midihead, a brand new song for Ultramix 3, you're going to be dancing

517
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:08,040
to this one in the fall, Raise Your Hands is the name of this song, and we'll be back

518
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:10,040
after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.

519
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:46,040
Welcome to the new revolution, gonna find a solution to the convolution

520
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:53,040
We're gathered in a strong dedication to the new revelation of the dancing nation

521
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:57,040
80 hertz on the floor as the crowd's on the raw

522
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:00,040
In the starting boom blast pull your ribcage

523
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:04,040
Landing lights in the mist as the knee changes

524
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:08,040
Cutting out to the band, raise your hand

525
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:45,040
It's time to take a stand, there's nobody to give a hand, but I've had to walk our

526
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:47,040
constitution.

527
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:53,040
80 hertz on the floor as the crowd starts to roar, feel the sounding moon flash through

528
00:40:53,040 --> 00:41:00,040
your rib cage, landing lights in the mist as the DJ assists, shouting out to the band,

529
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,040
Raise your hand

530
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:05,100
Raise your hand

531
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:09,720
Raise your hand

532
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:12,140
Raise your hand

533
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:43,140
Hey!

534
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:44,140
Hey!

535
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:45,140
Hey!

536
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:46,140
Hey!

537
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:47,140
Hey!

538
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:48,140
Hey!

539
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:49,140
Hey!

540
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:50,140
Hey!

541
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:51,140
Hey!

542
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:52,140
Hey!

543
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:53,140
Hey!

544
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:54,140
Hey!

545
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:55,140
Hey!

546
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:56,140
Hey!

547
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:31,140
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio. That was Minnie Head, Raise Your Hands.

548
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:35,140
That's going to be on DDR UltraMix III, of course edited down.

549
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:39,140
Unless there was this secret about long version songs, but I somehow highly doubt

550
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:43,140
those are ever coming back as the DDR songs seem to get a little larger.

551
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:48,140
Because it seems like the average length of an UltraMix II song was about at least a minute forty-five.

552
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:52,140
So, that will be edited down a little bit.

553
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:55,760
think I think that's gonna be a pretty kick-butt song when it's edited down it

554
00:42:55,760 --> 00:43:02,840
I'd love to beat in that song so it's gonna be neat I think if they edit out

555
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:11,360
the singing burn all our bridges all right I believe it was real it was

556
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:16,160
really good honestly it was yeah and he just found better than voluntary mm-hmm

557
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:21,080
so that's something yeah all right so I wanted to play that for you guys out

558
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:26,760
there. Orange Lounge Radio, giving you new Bomani music as soon as we can dig it up.

559
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:31,320
We'll play a new song from the new song pack from Xbox. Actually, I think it's two song

560
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:36,440
packs to go. We're a little late on it. But let's face it, boys and girls, we've, at least

561
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:39,920
me, was in the middle of the move with the new studio and everything, so I didn't have

562
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:43,440
a chance to get on Xbox Live previously and check out the song pack. Although, I have

563
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:49,440
to say, after downloading it, I kind of dig it. I like the new song packs. So, good stuff.

564
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:53,720
good stuff. Alright, let's move on to something else going on in the Balenci

565
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:59,040
community right now. Kind of a big story this week. A lot of exposure happening

566
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:05,160
for the new games thanks to E3 for the new DDR and of course Beatmania is

567
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:08,960
even getting out there. Some people are kind of questioning is this Beatmania

568
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:13,000
thing gonna catch on here in the US? It was a big risk in a way Konami was

569
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:17,520
taking. Jason Ian has been trying to get Beatmania over here for a long long

570
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:22,840
time and it took this long, finally, to come out here.

571
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:27,560
In fact, Game Informer, isn't that Game Stops magazine, what do they call it, Game Informer?

572
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:36,480
Game Informer Online put Beatmania number nine on its top ten list of E3 showstoppers.

573
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:40,560
That's not bad when you consider, you know, you've got, oh, I don't know, three new consoles

574
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:44,940
and new technologies and the new Zelda and everything else to compete with.

575
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:50,980
really a pretty good showing for a little game from Japan. CNN talking about

576
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:56,340
karaoke revolution party as well as MSNBC. Very interesting the karaoke

577
00:44:56,340 --> 00:45:01,060
revolution party seems to get a lot of the attention but you know I think for

578
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:06,100
those of us not in the hardcore I can kind of see where karaoke revolution is

579
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:12,700
more of an accessible game because everybody can at least try to sing but

580
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:15,980
Not everybody can really dance.

581
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:17,960
Some people just can't dance, but everybody

582
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:20,240
can try and sing.

583
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:24,500
It's a game you play with your voice.

584
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:29,500
So because of all this exposure, Konami, for whatever reason,

585
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:33,340
decided to put this poll on their site.

586
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:35,860
And so they're actually asking on their site,

587
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:40,620
which upcoming music game are you most looking forward to?

588
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:47,280
Karaoke Revolution Party, Beatmania, DDR Extreme 2, or DDR Ultramix 3?

589
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:49,620
Which one of these four do you guys think would be in the lead?

590
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:54,620
Oh, I already know the answer to this, but, um...

591
00:45:54,620 --> 00:45:57,340
Well then let me ask DarkSakura, which one of these three do you think would be in the

592
00:45:57,340 --> 00:45:58,340
lead?

593
00:45:58,340 --> 00:45:59,340
Or four?

594
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:00,340
The list?

595
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:04,140
Karaoke Revolution Party, Beatmania, DDR Extreme 2, or DDR Ultramix 3?

596
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:08,420
Well personally I put Beatmania at the top of the list.

597
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:16,860
Beatmania is currently in third place with four percent of the vote.

598
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:18,420
Here's what happened boys and girls.

599
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:22,500
There was a pretty legit thing going on where all the results were really somewhat neck

600
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:29,020
and neck Beatmania and DDR Extreme 2 leading for a little bit and then somebody decided

601
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:38,340
to launch a script because currently DDR UltraMix 3 has 73 percent of the vote with 83,096 votes

602
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:44,100
I think that's more people than are registered on DDR Freak, if I'm not

603
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:52,100
mistaking. Do you believe you're right? So somehow this puzzles me. The 83,000

604
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:55,700
people voted for UltraMix 3. Yeah right. Yeah right. Somebody out there is

605
00:46:55,700 --> 00:47:02,820
running a script. Why would somebody feel the need to run a script to put

606
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:10,540
false votes in this poll for Ultramix 3 nonetheless. I mean, don't get me wrong, I think the DDR

607
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:14,580
Ultramix games are some of the best things that have happened to us forever, but we all

608
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:20,140
knew going into E3, we all knew that it was inevitable we would get an Ultramix 3 in an

609
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:24,180
Extreme 2. What we didn't know, we didn't know we were getting Beatmania here in the

610
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:25,180
US.

611
00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:26,180
For the record?

612
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:27,180
What?

613
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:29,740
53,163 members of DDR Freak.

614
00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:30,740
Thank you.

615
00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:35,460
So, over, yeah, over 30,000 more people than are registered on DER free place to vote for

616
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:36,460
UltraMix 3.

617
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:37,460
Right.

618
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:38,460
Yeah, right.

619
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:39,460
Let me see.

620
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:45,620
I bet if I reloaded this frame right now, oh, never mind.

621
00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:46,620
They did stop running this script.

622
00:47:46,620 --> 00:47:47,620
Okay.

623
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:48,620
I don't see it anymore.

624
00:47:48,620 --> 00:47:53,140
But for a while, some of the message boards were saying, dude, every time you click reload

625
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:59,180
on the poll results, you can see that UltraMix 3 jumps up by like five or six votes each

626
00:47:59,180 --> 00:48:05,540
time. So obviously somebody was running a script. But why did you feel the need to

627
00:48:05,540 --> 00:48:08,460
run a script? We did not know that Beatmania was going to be coming before

628
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:12,500
E3, so this is something we should be backing. Same thing with Karaoke

629
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:16,980
Revolution Party in a way. I know it's kind of the stepchild of the Bomani

630
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:20,660
series for those of us that are core, you know, have been into the games for a long

631
00:48:20,660 --> 00:48:24,860
time, but that sing and dance thing, we weren't expecting that really. At least I

632
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:29,980
wasn't I was just expecting karaoke revolution volume 4 would just you know

633
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:35,420
more songs same old shit different game right but now we get karaoke revolution

634
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:39,340
party which is you know being a little bit innovative so that's kind of neat

635
00:48:39,340 --> 00:48:43,440
but somebody felt the need out there to run a script by the way somebody out

636
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:46,660
there apparently decided that they're sad the karaoke revolutions falling

637
00:48:46,660 --> 00:48:49,780
behind because they're running a script for karaoke revolution party voting as

638
00:48:49,780 --> 00:48:56,660
well which is up to now 20% of the vote 23,724 votes I somehow doubt that's

639
00:48:56,660 --> 00:49:01,780
legit especially when you consider the DDR extreme 2 which probably sells

640
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:08,780
better the series extreme than any of these games DDR extreme 2 2129 votes 1%

641
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:16,020
of the vote yeah right so do you think a Konami reps gonna look at this and go

642
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:20,900
yeah this makes sense. Do you think a Konami rep even gives a shit about this

643
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:24,600
poll honestly? This is the part that surprised me is that it was like the

644
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:28,420
news on like half the Bahmani sites out there not that I blame them because it

645
00:49:28,420 --> 00:49:32,900
is kind of cool that Konami's putting it on their front page but I think people

646
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:37,500
read into it way too much I think people assume that oh my gosh because Konami

647
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:41,820
put this on their front page poll this is gonna make or break the future of

648
00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:48,020
of Bomani Games. No. All these games were shown at E3. All these games had press releases

649
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:53,020
and release dates, even though some of them weren't so specific, release dates were attached

650
00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:58,900
to them. Unlike some games shown at E3, Duke Nukem Forever, these games will come out eventually.

651
00:49:58,900 --> 00:49:59,900
You don't...

652
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:01,780
You had Duke Nukem Forever at E3 this year?

653
00:50:01,780 --> 00:50:02,780
Years ago they did.

654
00:50:02,780 --> 00:50:06,140
I was gonna say, wow, they actually had a show...

655
00:50:06,140 --> 00:50:09,500
You don't have to vote for this game

656
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:13,340
over and over and over again for it to show up.

657
00:50:13,340 --> 00:50:15,340
This poll is not going to make or break

658
00:50:15,340 --> 00:50:16,860
the future of the UltraMix series.

659
00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:18,180
I hate to break it to you.

660
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:21,980
This poll is not going to make or break the BeatMania series.

661
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:23,900
So take a little rest in that, those of you

662
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:25,820
guys that are pissed off that BeatMania's only

663
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:26,820
got 4% of the vote.

664
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:28,180
Nobody cares.

665
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:29,940
You want to know what Konami cares about?

666
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:34,220
When the game comes out, they want people to buy it.

667
00:50:34,220 --> 00:50:39,100
you can't run a script for that so if you truly support the games I hope

668
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:42,380
you're gonna buy them when they come out because if not enough people buy beat

669
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:45,800
mania when it comes out you know what they're gonna say they're gonna say the

670
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:51,820
same thing they said with guitar freaks in Japan fuck it your thoughts on this

671
00:50:51,820 --> 00:50:57,380
Loki this is just an opinion poll who gives a crap it doesn't matter it

672
00:50:57,380 --> 00:51:01,900
doesn't mean anything it's just ooh let's see what the opinion is just like

673
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:06,980
on Dear Freak polls. I mean, come on, those don't mean anything. It's the same damn thing.

674
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:10,540
We don't want to belittle, and the polls on our website, they don't mean anything either,

675
00:51:10,540 --> 00:51:15,300
honestly, and I hate to belittle it, but the honest thing is, it's just something, it's

676
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:20,260
a fun poll. It's just, you know, how many of you guys in the room thought the last Star

677
00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:24,740
Wars movie sucked? You know, and then, you know, you poll, and it's fun. Oh, really,

678
00:51:24,740 --> 00:51:29,580
huh, huh, who knew I was in the minority? It's a teehee fun poll, all these polls on

679
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:34,900
This isn't the MTV Video Game Awards, folks.

680
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:35,900
Oh, yeah.

681
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:36,900
You remember this?

682
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:37,900
Years ago?

683
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:39,540
Halo and Dance Dance Revolution.

684
00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:44,980
Didn't J-Dog from DDR Freak, of all people, write the script that did this?

685
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:47,860
For the...

686
00:51:47,860 --> 00:51:48,860
Like remember...

687
00:51:48,860 --> 00:51:49,860
Oh, when was it?

688
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:50,860
It was either 2005...

689
00:51:50,860 --> 00:51:51,860
I think it was...

690
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:58,900
I want to say it was going into 2004 that MTV was going to do a special, the Top 20

691
00:51:58,900 --> 00:52:05,380
games of all time or something and DDR was nominated so they built a script on

692
00:52:05,380 --> 00:52:08,980
DDR Freak for everybody to run that would vote over and over and over in

693
00:52:08,980 --> 00:52:12,700
this poll and then like the Halo kids caught on as well so they all started

694
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:16,820
running the script and it was this big war and in the end according to the

695
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:22,100
website DDR was number one and we were all yeah DDR is gonna be number one on

696
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:27,340
the top 20 countdown yeah guess what when it was actually put out on TV

697
00:52:27,340 --> 00:52:33,980
me, guess where DDR landed on the poll. Last place, 20th, last place. Your voting on the

698
00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:39,980
website didn't mean shit. Now, the intentions back then were good.

699
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:45,820
I don't think that, anyway. What? No, finish it off. Well, the intentions

700
00:52:45,820 --> 00:52:52,620
back then were different because MTV, that's different. You don't know what they're going

701
00:52:52,620 --> 00:52:56,220
to do. So I understand why people... MTV is synonymous with crap anyway.

702
00:52:56,220 --> 00:53:00,220
Their whole thinking, which was just insane anyways, was like,

703
00:53:00,220 --> 00:53:05,220
if it gets on MTV as number one, then maybe Konami will realize,

704
00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:08,220
whoa, the fans love it! And they'll put it on arcade mix.

705
00:53:08,220 --> 00:53:13,220
Yeah, Konami will realize the fans love it when stores are sold out of it

706
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:16,220
and you can't find it on shelves anywhere. That's when they'll know.

707
00:53:16,220 --> 00:53:21,220
For instance, Katamari Damacy, do you think we'd ever be seeing a sequel

708
00:53:21,220 --> 00:53:24,220
if that game wasn't impossible to find?

709
00:53:24,220 --> 00:53:30,460
No. That game is selling, like, mad. That's why, you know, there's going to be a sequel

710
00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:38,340
to Katamari Damacy. No MTV poll, no poll over at Namco's site or anything had to dictate

711
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:39,420
that new game coming out.

712
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:41,780
All right, I think we're...

713
00:53:41,780 --> 00:53:44,700
Numbers, money, that's what they look at as the bottom line.

714
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:46,700
I think we've covered the poll thing enough.

715
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:48,140
It just irritates me.

716
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:51,660
I don't even want to dedicate this much effort into talking about this.

717
00:53:51,660 --> 00:53:56,060
It just irritates me that somebody, I mean, why would somebody do this?

718
00:53:56,060 --> 00:54:01,280
They'd be like, hey, look at how big my internet penis is, it takes up 73% of the screen right

719
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:02,280
now.

720
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:06,300
Nobody will ever be as big as Jason's.

721
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:10,980
Recognize.

722
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:13,860
Just remember, if you think this poll is going to do any good, just watch what happened on

723
00:54:13,860 --> 00:54:15,260
the MTV thing.

724
00:54:15,260 --> 00:54:17,580
The answers are already predetermined.

725
00:54:17,580 --> 00:54:22,580
Is this what's going to happen if they allow internet voting for presidents?

726
00:54:22,580 --> 00:54:27,580
Absolutely, that's why it'll never happen, at least in the next 20 years.

727
00:54:27,580 --> 00:54:34,580
But, who knows, I've been proven wrong before, we'll see what happens.

728
00:54:34,580 --> 00:54:37,580
How about a break time, kids?

729
00:54:37,580 --> 00:54:40,580
How about it?

730
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:46,580
I've been craving to hear a song from GuitarFreaksV ever since I played it, because it's awesome.

731
00:54:46,580 --> 00:54:51,140
at least I liked it I don't know I don't know what my co-host will think but I'm

732
00:54:51,140 --> 00:54:55,340
entitled to my we song once in a while I think so this is vanilla ninja with

did i have to have a song for the cage mouse

740
00:55:36,580 --> 00:55:39,580
I've always found the place to be

741
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:44,580
So far from this fallen sea

742
00:55:45,580 --> 00:55:48,580
Like tears on a bowing wave

743
00:55:48,580 --> 00:55:52,580
A shadow up my face

744
00:55:53,580 --> 00:55:55,580
Your kisses turn from hot to cold

745
00:55:55,580 --> 00:55:57,580
And I've felt like a center bone

746
00:55:57,580 --> 00:55:59,580
Cheeseburger with dirty men

747
00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:02,580
Looking for love that they never will get

748
00:56:02,580 --> 00:56:07,020
I'm feeling about to feel alone

749
00:56:07,020 --> 00:56:09,200
I'm feeling so high on the road

750
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:13,580
You know it, you know it

751
00:56:13,580 --> 00:56:16,260
If you wanna lie to me again

752
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:18,360
The reason why my face is on the end

753
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:22,500
Just go there and say there

754
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:30,040
Yeah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

755
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:41,040
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

756
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:45,040
Feel the thoughts, you feel the love I'm going through the heart and all the bones

757
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:52,040
There's no way, there's no way If you wanna like me again

758
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:54,040
Don't think you have to take it all again

759
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:56,040
Just roll it

760
00:56:56,040 --> 00:56:58,040
And save it

761
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:48,560
Can you be your fantasy?

762
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:49,560
Give me ecstasy

763
00:58:49,560 --> 00:59:04,560
Why little feelings die of action When we fought for satisfaction

764
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:10,560
But our hearts and as always, saved me

765
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:15,560
Why? Little love, all this magic

766
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:19,560
Making you kind of tragic

767
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:23,560
We were here for the best

768
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:27,560
In the heat of the night

769
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:30,560
Marching close to the fire

770
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:34,560
And the power of our hearts

771
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:37,560
As we fight inside

772
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:44,560
And the heat of the night was too close to the fire

773
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:51,560
And the power of our hearts made us live by this fire

774
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:58,560
And the heat of the night

775
00:59:58,560 --> 01:00:05,560
The heat of the night

776
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:07,560
In the heat of the night

777
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:20,560
This just sounds

778
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:23,560
This just sounds

779
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:30,560
This just sounds

780
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:32,560
Everybody wants a piece of the pie

781
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:34,560
Ota mia means to I

782
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:32,560
This is the way we rock, this is the way we ride

783
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:35,300
As we demonstrate, as we demonstrate,

784
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:37,520
Everybody wants to be a son of mine,

785
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:39,020
Most of me that meets the eye,

786
01:01:39,020 --> 01:01:41,020
Cause those are the kind of people that I know that fight,

787
01:01:41,020 --> 01:01:43,020
Cause I, my, them is right,

788
01:01:43,020 --> 01:01:44,300
This is the way we dance,

789
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:45,560
This is the way we rock,

790
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:47,060
This is the way we ride,

791
01:01:47,060 --> 01:01:49,560
As we demonstrate, as we demonstrate,

792
01:01:53,560 --> 01:01:56,560
To the steps of the orange path,

793
01:01:56,560 --> 01:01:58,560
This media sucks,

794
01:01:58,560 --> 01:02:00,560
All of us,

795
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:12,920
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio and episode number 144 for you guys.

796
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:16,320
You know it's kind of sad because it is a three day weekend and typically on the three

797
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:20,440
day weekends we do our drunk shows, but you may notice we're not doing that tonight.

798
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:22,640
That's because Jamie and I are going clubbing after tonight's show.

799
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:23,840
We're getting our goth on.

800
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:26,520
Because we don't get to go out Sunday nights very often so we're going to go out tonight

801
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:28,480
and Loki, well I don't know what his excuse is.

802
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:30,480
Oh yeah, he drove over here so he can't really drink.

803
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:32,480
So, he'll go club seals.

804
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:34,480
Yeah, he'll go club seals instead of clubbing.

805
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:36,480
I'm gonna have me some Guinness.

806
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:39,480
I totally want a drink at the club, man.

807
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:41,480
I can have one drink.

808
01:02:41,480 --> 01:02:43,480
You can have one and then not drink anything for three hours.

809
01:02:43,480 --> 01:02:44,480
That's pretty much what I get to do.

810
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:45,480
Drink a lot of water.

811
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:50,480
Because it takes, I think, two hours for a high metabolism to oxidize alcohol.

812
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:53,480
For a big guy like me, though, my body can handle a lot, so...

813
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:55,480
Lightweight. You're lightweight and you know it.

814
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:56,480
Not anymore.

815
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:57,480
Not anymore.

816
01:02:57,480 --> 01:03:07,480
anymore I may be in college maybe before I was 21 oh yeah hi kids I remember you

817
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:11,640
falling out of the chair during all the okay drunk show yeah I seem to recall

818
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:16,280
the last drunk show he had I was lying down in the hallway kicking the wall

819
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:19,680
trying to run up the wall and I was yelling I'm in the matrix I'm in the

820
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:25,680
matrix and I don't even remember how we got to that on our radio show but this

821
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:30,680
I remember eating half a box of waffles, which I paid you back for!

822
01:03:30,680 --> 01:03:31,680
I remember you paid me back.

823
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:35,680
I bought you a big ol' box of industrial sized waffles.

824
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:36,680
And they were eaten.

825
01:03:36,680 --> 01:03:38,680
So we'll have to do another drunk show sometime.

826
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:40,680
I'm happy because I got a toaster today.

827
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:41,680
A bagel-sized toaster.

828
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:44,680
And I hate bagels, but it's still a toaster.

829
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:46,680
But they're good for cooking waffles in.

830
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:47,680
Yes.

831
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:52,680
You know, my friend told me that he was going to get me, as a housewarming present, a Hello Kitty toaster.

832
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:53,680
I'm still waiting.

833
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:54,680
What the hell is up with Hello Kitty?

834
01:03:54,680 --> 01:03:59,240
Hello Kitty, I swear to God, it's like, it's almost like the Nazi revolution, I mean, it's

835
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:03,640
like they have everything Hello Kitty, it's just, Hello Kitty is going to take over the

836
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:04,640
world.

837
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:05,640
Sign me around!

838
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:08,680
Did you play the Hello Kitty Roller Rescue at E3?

839
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:10,680
No, but I saw you play it.

840
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:11,680
So cute!

841
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:12,680
So cute!

842
01:04:12,680 --> 01:04:13,680
So cute!

843
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:21,040
Yeah, I like the suggestion from our chatroom.

844
01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:22,720
Drunk podcast episode!

845
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:26,720
Yeah, that'd be really great for us with all the additional exposure that's been getting

846
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:27,720
lately.

847
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:28,720
We could bring the recorder, though, to the club.

848
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:31,320
But what are we going to get at the club?

849
01:04:31,320 --> 01:04:32,320
Nobody talks.

850
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:33,320
It's Gothic night.

851
01:04:33,320 --> 01:04:34,320
Nobody talks.

852
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:36,360
They act pretentious and ignore each other.

853
01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:37,600
At the club.

854
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:42,480
Can you actually hear someone talking four inches away from you at the club?

855
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:43,480
No.

856
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:44,480
Seriously.

857
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:45,480
And this is...

858
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:46,480
Yes.

859
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:50,000
Yes, boys and girls, Jamie and I go to the Goth club on Sunday nights.

860
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,960
I go every week on Thursday.

861
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:54,840
Now don't knock it till you've tried it.

862
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:58,920
I know that a lot of you guys are in high school, college, and you probably...

863
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:00,400
Either you are a goth kid...

864
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:01,400
You're emo!

865
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:02,840
Stop crying, emo kid!

866
01:05:02,840 --> 01:05:05,840
Either you are a goth kid or you make fun of the goth kids.

867
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:09,640
So give them a break.

868
01:05:09,640 --> 01:05:11,120
Roll down your pants.

869
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:16,560
Honestly folks, you should be dating the goth kids, because they're the ones that later

870
01:05:16,560 --> 01:05:20,640
on down the road end up being really slutty.

871
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:26,640
Stop. Hey, I don't want to go off of personal experience, okay?

872
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:33,640
Okay, I knew a goth girl. She wasn't very popular in high school, but she got out of high school, pierced like crazy, and then became a stripper.

873
01:05:33,640 --> 01:05:35,640
Was she pierced?

874
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:36,640
Uh-huh.

875
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:37,640
Wow.

876
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:50,640
I replaced. But anyways, um, yeah, so that was actually the last time I went to the goth club, was with this chick, and, um, because when I went there, then, um, some guy was trying to proposition me for sex.

877
01:05:53,640 --> 01:06:01,640
Like, they wanted to take me home and give me money and have their way with me, and that was the end of the goth club.

878
01:06:01,640 --> 01:06:06,920
Have I ever taken you to the gay club?

879
01:06:06,920 --> 01:06:10,160
No. Oh, you need to go sometime. I like karaoke there,

880
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:13,680
even though I don't sing anything. I just watch. I sing.

881
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:16,840
We need this to be like a mission. We need to take Loki to the gay bar.

882
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:20,160
I know that Nellie wants to go. I know she does.

883
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:24,920
I don't really care. It's not like it's going to be like,

884
01:06:24,920 --> 01:06:27,920
Oh my God! Homosexuals! Oh no!

885
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:29,920
I was just like, whatever, I'm bored.

886
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:31,920
You only lived with one for how long?

887
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:36,920
Seriously. You didn't catch Gay from living with me, did you?

888
01:06:36,920 --> 01:06:37,920
I don't think so.

889
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:38,920
Okay, good.

890
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:41,920
I caught Gay from you. Remember the Pepsi bong?

891
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:46,920
This is years ago at our first March Madness.

892
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:55,920
It was Shiggle selling these huge things that looked like a big bone,

893
01:06:55,920 --> 01:07:02,480
bone, but I called it the Pepsi bong. And I was passing it to Rob to take a drink. I

894
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:06,400
was like, I don't have any diseases. And then he took a drink, passed it back, and I started

895
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:10,880
drinking it. He goes, I do. I have gay. I was like, oh my God, I caught gay. And then

896
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:15,360
I hugged Irene.

897
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:19,680
Very excellent point made in the chat room. You guys should not tease the goth kids, you

898
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:23,320
people that listen to the show. You should not be teasing the goth kids. You fucking

899
01:07:23,320 --> 01:07:32,600
play DDR. Yup. Correction, I do not play DDR. I just do a radio show. What, you play in

900
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:38,380
the groove? That's even worse. I don't play in the groove. No, honestly, but I think doing

901
01:07:38,380 --> 01:07:44,700
a radio show about DDR is probably worse than playing DDR. Let me do a quick imitation of

902
01:07:44,700 --> 01:07:57,240
Jamie and I at the goth club oh Jamie I'm feeling so gothic I'm so gothic

903
01:07:57,240 --> 01:08:08,620
Jamie okay you know why that when the night comes so do I Jamie I'm so gothic

904
01:08:08,620 --> 01:08:16,940
bats fly out of my ass I could make a comment about that let's go on the dance

905
01:08:16,940 --> 01:08:22,700
floor and swing our hands about let's close our eyes and let our hands move

906
01:08:22,700 --> 01:08:26,760
really above in the air and let the music flow into our body let's see how

907
01:08:26,760 --> 01:08:33,700
many people we can pile in the cage oh I get so turned on by cages I'm gonna make

908
01:08:33,700 --> 01:08:38,420
out with that thing over there I can't tell if it's man or woman but it has a

909
01:08:38,420 --> 01:08:45,420
a kid's course. Oh, that's Jessica's purse! I will make love to it even so. I'm feeling

910
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:55,500
so tragic, I'm gonna go outside and contemplate jumping! Off the curb. I'm going to slit my

911
01:08:56,860 --> 01:09:03,860
wrists and then go to work tomorrow. That's emo. Oh, I'm sorry. That's emo. Anyways. You

912
01:09:03,860 --> 01:09:08,540
Anyways, you know what I do. I sit on the bench and get drunk

913
01:09:09,180 --> 01:09:15,460
That's what I do. And then I watch everybody. I'm like, I'm too fucking drunk to move. That's what I do

914
01:09:16,060 --> 01:09:21,280
The golf club for me is all about planning my outfit because I get to be as eccentric as I want to be

915
01:09:21,280 --> 01:09:27,180
I'm thinking about wearing my I hate myself and I want to die shirt from English calm tonight because that's always a fun choice my

916
01:09:27,180 --> 01:09:30,180
I, uh, the one that you bought me.

917
01:09:30,180 --> 01:09:32,180
Oh yeah, the revolver.

918
01:09:32,180 --> 01:09:34,180
You have to go to the little goth club wearing all white.

919
01:09:34,180 --> 01:09:36,180
People do.

920
01:09:36,180 --> 01:09:42,180
I've seen, dude, you have to go to see the guy that dresses up like Michael Jackson.

921
01:09:42,180 --> 01:09:44,180
Why?

922
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:46,180
That guy is my fucking hero.

923
01:09:46,180 --> 01:09:51,180
One glove and the hat and everything and he fucking moonwalks to goth music.

924
01:09:51,180 --> 01:09:53,180
That's awesome.

925
01:09:53,180 --> 01:09:55,180
That is so weird.

926
01:09:55,180 --> 01:09:56,180
That is awesome.

927
01:09:56,180 --> 01:10:01,180
dress up like Pee Wee Herman and go there or something. No, actually, no I don't.

928
01:10:06,180 --> 01:10:13,180
Oh, hey, hey! Oh, I feel so good being in this club! I'm on Ro-Rock and I'm one of my

929
01:10:13,180 --> 01:10:22,180
lovesome children. I know, he's still innocent until proven guilty. Oh, yeah, we talk about

930
01:10:22,180 --> 01:10:25,680
We talk about video games on this show once in a while, don't we?

931
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:28,180
What was that on Saturday Night Live?

932
01:10:28,180 --> 01:10:29,180
I don't know, I don't watch that.

933
01:10:29,180 --> 01:10:30,180
Goth Talk.

934
01:10:30,180 --> 01:10:31,180
Goth Talk.

935
01:10:31,180 --> 01:10:32,180
That was great.

936
01:10:32,180 --> 01:10:37,180
I'm as the only piece of shit so sorry.

937
01:10:37,180 --> 01:10:40,180
I'm almost, loads ago they first denied shade.

938
01:10:40,180 --> 01:10:42,180
Yes.

939
01:10:42,180 --> 01:10:43,180
I just remember when...

940
01:10:43,180 --> 01:10:47,180
Prom of Doom.

941
01:10:47,180 --> 01:10:48,180
Alright.

942
01:10:48,180 --> 01:10:50,180
That actually amused me to no end.

943
01:10:50,180 --> 01:10:52,500
Didn't they have Sarah Michelle Gellar on that one?

944
01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:53,860
I think Sarah Michelle Gellar.

945
01:10:53,860 --> 01:10:54,860
That one was great.

946
01:10:54,860 --> 01:10:57,420
And Robert Downey Jr. was the one I remember.

947
01:10:57,420 --> 01:10:58,420
Anyway.

948
01:10:58,420 --> 01:10:59,420
That was great.

949
01:10:59,420 --> 01:11:03,340
We're going to open up the Skype line now to try and steer us back on to talking about

950
01:11:03,340 --> 01:11:04,340
games.

951
01:11:04,340 --> 01:11:08,260
I'm going to open up the Skype line www.orangelaunchrater.com and click on interact with us.

952
01:11:08,260 --> 01:11:15,060
Funny thing is though, okay, this is the other thing, before I got off on the topic of the

953
01:11:15,060 --> 01:11:16,060
golf club.

954
01:11:16,060 --> 01:11:17,060
Tangent?

955
01:11:17,060 --> 01:11:19,900
Yeah, that slight little tangent there that only took us 20 minutes to talk about.

956
01:11:19,900 --> 01:11:24,700
Or as BlackDevil or X says, goth digression.

957
01:11:24,700 --> 01:11:28,220
Before we got off on the goth digression, we were talking about tonight's show and how,

958
01:11:28,220 --> 01:11:31,140
you know, it's mediocre because we're not drinking tonight.

959
01:11:31,140 --> 01:11:33,340
Well, also what's interesting is that...

960
01:11:33,340 --> 01:11:36,580
Oh, that's the cool thing about the fact that my friend brought over Star Wars.

961
01:11:36,580 --> 01:11:40,580
He brought me a big thing of vodka and I have orange juice at home.

962
01:11:40,580 --> 01:11:46,140
Because it's part of a three-day weekend, Memorial Day weekend, we typically have less

963
01:11:46,140 --> 01:11:49,920
listeners on three-day weekend because people decide they can go out and get a

964
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:54,020
life because it's you know another weekend night or something I don't know

965
01:11:54,020 --> 01:12:04,040
where you kids get off thinking that wherever they can all right well the

966
01:12:04,040 --> 01:12:08,780
skype lines open and I'm noticing per our list there's a whopping two people

967
01:12:08,780 --> 01:12:11,980
online so I'm not thinking the sky point it's gonna be a good idea tonight we

968
01:12:11,980 --> 01:12:15,900
might have to go back in the goth talk again no you know what we'll get Paris

969
01:12:15,900 --> 01:12:18,460
Hilton Chat. House of Wax just came out, you know.

970
01:12:18,460 --> 01:12:22,300
You know, I heard that movie kind of sucked, but I heard that she doesn't die quick enough.

971
01:12:22,300 --> 01:12:25,500
I actually had free tickets to that, and I threw them away.

972
01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:29,460
I just want to download the scene where she dies so that I can shoot in the industry for

973
01:12:29,460 --> 01:12:30,460
working out.

974
01:12:30,460 --> 01:12:34,620
You know what else I saw actually online while I was doing research for Feel 3 or 3Feel,

975
01:12:34,620 --> 01:12:39,420
whatever that's called? They actually have CGI Paris Hilton nude models that you can

976
01:12:39,420 --> 01:12:44,340
get to actually create your own CGI Paris Hilton porn. I don't know why you would, because

977
01:12:44,340 --> 01:12:48,740
that seems like an awful lot of work to me but I guess you could do that have

978
01:12:48,740 --> 01:12:53,260
you seen the new Paris Hilton commercial yeah why are people getting up like an

979
01:12:53,260 --> 01:12:57,100
uproar with that it's just you know Paris Hilton being stupid and slutty and

980
01:12:57,100 --> 01:13:02,180
you know with a burger is it just me or is she really the wrong person to be

981
01:13:02,180 --> 01:13:08,060
selling let's wait here hamburgers does the bitch look like she eats anything

982
01:13:08,060 --> 01:13:13,620
no she seems more like a sausage hotdog type person to me I don't know if she

983
01:13:13,620 --> 01:13:18,980
can handle the burger is bigger than she is okay honestly folks the burger is bigger than

984
01:13:18,980 --> 01:13:24,340
she is she'd be like oh my god can you cut that lettuce in half please that is way too

985
01:13:24,340 --> 01:13:32,140
much for me like oh my god the whole thing was just an excuse to use her tagline that's

986
01:13:32,140 --> 01:13:37,860
hot which isn't even really a tag why does she have a tech why she have a show all she's

987
01:13:37,860 --> 01:13:43,340
done is like, oh, there we go. Saved by a phone call. Hi, you're on Orange

988
01:13:43,340 --> 01:13:48,460
Lounge Radio. Thank frickin' God, stop the Paris Hilton

989
01:13:48,460 --> 01:13:51,900
crap. Actually, it was kind of inadvertent. We actually

990
01:13:51,900 --> 01:13:55,420
didn't mean to start doing the Paris Hilton chat, but I just, I had to get that out about

991
01:13:55,420 --> 01:13:58,220
the commercial. All right.

992
01:13:58,220 --> 01:13:59,820
You could have spared all of us, you really could have.

993
01:13:59,820 --> 01:14:03,900
I'm sorry. Hi, Jason, how are you? Hi, Rob, I'm pretty good.

994
01:14:03,900 --> 01:14:07,180
This is the man with the internet penis, ladies and gentlemen.

995
01:14:07,180 --> 01:14:09,700
No scripting on Konami polls needed.

996
01:14:09,700 --> 01:14:12,340
He just keeps pressing the vote button over and over and over again.

997
01:14:12,340 --> 01:14:13,580
Oh yeah, it's me.

998
01:14:13,580 --> 01:14:14,580
I'm sorry.

999
01:14:14,580 --> 01:14:15,580
I'm not...

1000
01:14:15,580 --> 01:14:16,580
Uh, no.

1001
01:14:16,580 --> 01:14:17,900
Did you write the script, Jason?

1002
01:14:17,900 --> 01:14:18,900
No.

1003
01:14:18,900 --> 01:14:19,900
Did you?

1004
01:14:19,900 --> 01:14:20,900
No.

1005
01:14:20,900 --> 01:14:21,900
Are you lying?

1006
01:14:21,900 --> 01:14:22,900
Nope.

1007
01:14:22,900 --> 01:14:23,900
What's on your mind?

1008
01:14:23,900 --> 01:14:24,900
Um...

1009
01:14:24,900 --> 01:14:25,900
I...

1010
01:14:25,900 --> 01:14:28,920
Well, I had Paris Hilton on my mind, never wanted it out, so...

1011
01:14:28,920 --> 01:14:32,100
Who hasn't had Paris Hilton sitting on their head, huh?

1012
01:14:32,100 --> 01:14:34,620
well me until now

1013
01:14:34,620 --> 01:14:38,020
since you wrote the site now i see now even getting other people calling into

1014
01:14:38,020 --> 01:14:40,620
those people have to wait to show my figure not the right

1015
01:14:40,620 --> 01:14:43,700
uh... you we haven't talked to you since he three was over what do you think of

1016
01:14:43,700 --> 01:14:47,060
the old e three and konami's showing eighty three

1017
01:14:47,060 --> 01:14:50,820
everybody was talking to you because i couldn't go and people are all that

1018
01:14:50,820 --> 01:14:52,780
don't tell them to go to hell

1019
01:14:52,780 --> 01:14:55,160
uh... believe me i think it's not good

1020
01:14:55,160 --> 01:14:58,540
that that to me that the main thing to do we'll go next year will be filed

1021
01:14:58,540 --> 01:15:00,480
answer it better

1022
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:03,620
definitely go what do you think of konami's the lineup this year

1023
01:15:03,620 --> 01:15:07,320
i want to see a full thing of the group of loose

1024
01:15:07,320 --> 01:15:11,280
all with that you know you know i'm surprised there was like a minute long

1025
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:14,760
clip that show i don't know i know that i are now

1026
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:18,200
got a video of it did not get a deal that way i don't know what he's doing

1027
01:15:18,200 --> 01:15:20,320
with the video or where it went

1028
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:25,160
but he got a video works for us now right so maybe we can have something up

1029
01:15:25,160 --> 01:15:26,440
maybe we can have something up

1030
01:15:26,440 --> 01:15:30,440
I will ask Mel about that just for you, Jason, if he did get a video of that.

1031
01:15:30,440 --> 01:15:32,440
I'm surprised Shane didn't get a video of that.

1032
01:15:32,440 --> 01:15:36,440
Mikolatov, how many times did the Groovles perform throughout the whole thing?

1033
01:15:36,440 --> 01:15:38,440
I think it was like three, four, and three.

1034
01:15:38,440 --> 01:15:40,440
So it was like ten times they performed.

1035
01:15:40,440 --> 01:15:42,440
Mikolatov was at least at seven of them.

1036
01:15:42,440 --> 01:15:44,440
At least.

1037
01:15:44,440 --> 01:15:45,440
I took a bunch of pictures.

1038
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:46,440
You did?

1039
01:15:46,440 --> 01:15:48,440
Which you can see on Orange on Dream.

1040
01:15:48,440 --> 01:15:49,440
Oh, what a lovely plug.

1041
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:51,440
Lots of Groovles' pictures on Orange on Dream.

1042
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:53,440
And the Q-in grinned at me.

1043
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:55,440
He was upside down.

1044
01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:57,680
You're all cute.

1045
01:15:57,680 --> 01:16:01,440
That's a good reminder that our E3 picture galleries are coming online.

1046
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:02,440
Get this.

1047
01:16:02,440 --> 01:16:09,640
We're only through two days of the show, 500 pictures already on the site, and only one

1048
01:16:09,640 --> 01:16:12,020
of them with me in it.

1049
01:16:12,020 --> 01:16:17,840
And we wonder why we're having bandwidth issues right now.

1050
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:20,800
I smile every time I see an iPod commercial now.

1051
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:21,800
Why is that?

1052
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:26,800
Were you the one that told me that the Grooviloos were the iPod commercial Mosaic people as well?

1053
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:31,960
Yes, that's what I was told anyway. The Grooviloos are the iPod shadow dancers. And the thing

1054
01:16:31,960 --> 01:16:37,680
is that they are also going to be the shadow dancers in one of the new DDRs. We never got

1055
01:16:37,680 --> 01:16:42,100
a clear answer whether it was UltraMix 3 or Extreme 2, but one of them, the Grooviloos

1056
01:16:42,100 --> 01:16:46,900
are actually UltraMix 3 modeled. Is it UltraMix 3? That's what they kept saying at the show,

1057
01:16:46,900 --> 01:16:51,560
but then I heard someone at the end say, no, it's Extreme 2. So nobody seems to know. But

1058
01:16:51,560 --> 01:16:55,900
But the Grooviloos are being motion captured for, or somehow the moves are being inspired

1059
01:16:55,900 --> 01:16:56,900
by that.

1060
01:16:56,900 --> 01:17:00,140
So that's, if you like the dancing in the iPod commercials, you're going to see it on

1061
01:17:00,140 --> 01:17:02,020
your ditter game pretty soon.

1062
01:17:02,020 --> 01:17:09,140
Are they going to be the competitive dancers in the quest mode in UltraMix 3 perhaps?

1063
01:17:09,140 --> 01:17:10,140
I don't know.

1064
01:17:10,140 --> 01:17:13,080
What little bit I played of quest mode, it wasn't really set up like that.

1065
01:17:13,080 --> 01:17:17,200
It was just, it was very similar to Mission in a way, kind of.

1066
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:18,200
It was a thought.

1067
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:19,200
Yeah, that was a good thought.

1068
01:17:19,200 --> 01:17:20,200
Interesting one.

1069
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:21,200
Very good.

1070
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:26,820
By the way, also included in Dark Sakura's pictures, tons of screen caps.

1071
01:17:26,820 --> 01:17:29,480
You want to see what the song banners for some of the new songs look like?

1072
01:17:29,480 --> 01:17:30,480
She got it.

1073
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:31,920
Got all of them for DDR Mario.

1074
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:34,880
Yeah, you want to see DDR Mario?

1075
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:35,880
Go look.

1076
01:17:35,880 --> 01:17:36,880
It's all there.

1077
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:37,880
Yeah, you people.

1078
01:17:37,880 --> 01:17:38,880
Have fun.

1079
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:40,680
Go look at our website and don't put us over bandwidth.

1080
01:17:40,680 --> 01:17:43,040
Yeah, don't forget to look into that, Jason.

1081
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:44,040
I'm working on that.

1082
01:17:44,040 --> 01:17:45,040
I'm already working on it.

1083
01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:46,040
Kisses.

1084
01:17:46,040 --> 01:17:47,040
All right.

1085
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:49,280
Anything else you want to share with our listeners?

1086
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:51,140
i'd just wanted you guys to stop

1087
01:17:51,140 --> 01:17:52,160
it

1088
01:17:52,160 --> 01:17:56,060
well if that's fine what will go off the air right now we are we are not going to

1089
01:17:56,060 --> 01:17:58,420
do no no no no no no no no no

1090
01:17:58,420 --> 01:18:00,940
we got confidence to sleep in them you know

1091
01:18:00,940 --> 01:18:05,740
uh... familiar says the millions to cast and uh... you know i think you know i

1092
01:18:05,740 --> 01:18:08,380
don't have to be talking about my private life

1093
01:18:08,380 --> 01:18:11,740
uh...

1094
01:18:11,740 --> 01:18:13,480
all right

1095
01:18:13,480 --> 01:18:16,280
uh... i guess we'll hang up and let somebody else call now jason

1096
01:18:16,280 --> 01:18:21,620
I still want I Feel Toy Remix to be in BeatMania USA.

1097
01:18:21,620 --> 01:18:24,060
I think that would make a very, very good crossover.

1098
01:18:24,060 --> 01:18:27,140
I'll play I Feel Toy Remix just for you later, and you can imagine it.

1099
01:18:27,140 --> 01:18:28,140
How's that sound?

1100
01:18:28,140 --> 01:18:29,140
That would make me very happy.

1101
01:18:29,140 --> 01:18:30,140
All right, we'll do that.

1102
01:18:30,140 --> 01:18:31,140
Thank you, Rob.

1103
01:18:31,140 --> 01:18:32,140
You're welcome.

1104
01:18:32,140 --> 01:18:33,140
See you.

1105
01:18:33,140 --> 01:18:34,140
Bye, Jamie.

1106
01:18:34,140 --> 01:18:35,140
Bye, Matt.

1107
01:18:35,140 --> 01:18:36,140
Bye, Rob.

1108
01:18:36,140 --> 01:18:37,140
No, you cannot leave us.

1109
01:18:37,140 --> 01:18:38,140
You must come up here and visit.

1110
01:18:38,140 --> 01:18:39,140
Oh, God, I want to.

1111
01:18:39,140 --> 01:18:40,140
We kidnapped.

1112
01:18:40,140 --> 01:18:41,140
All right.

1113
01:18:41,140 --> 01:18:46,140
Come to our dog castle, where we are.

1114
01:18:46,140 --> 01:18:48,140
Bye, Jason.

1115
01:18:48,140 --> 01:18:50,140
Bye, Rob.

1116
01:18:50,140 --> 01:18:53,140
You know who the original old school goth is?

1117
01:18:53,140 --> 01:18:55,140
Elvira?

1118
01:18:55,140 --> 01:18:56,140
No.

1119
01:18:56,140 --> 01:18:57,140
One!

1120
01:18:57,140 --> 01:18:58,140
Two!

1121
01:18:58,140 --> 01:18:59,140
Ah!

1122
01:18:59,140 --> 01:19:00,140
Ah!

1123
01:19:00,140 --> 01:19:01,140
Ah!

1124
01:19:01,140 --> 01:19:02,140
Three!

1125
01:19:02,140 --> 01:19:03,140
Four!

1126
01:19:03,140 --> 01:19:04,140
Ah!

1127
01:19:04,140 --> 01:19:05,140
Ah!

1128
01:19:05,140 --> 01:19:06,140
Ah!

1129
01:19:06,140 --> 01:19:07,140
You know what?

1130
01:19:07,140 --> 01:19:08,140
We had Count Chocula too.

1131
01:19:08,140 --> 01:19:09,140
Oh, that's true.

1132
01:19:09,140 --> 01:19:10,140
Count Chocula was goth.

1133
01:19:10,140 --> 01:19:11,140
Hi!

1134
01:19:11,140 --> 01:19:12,140
You're on Orange is Odd's radio.

1135
01:19:12,140 --> 01:19:13,140
Hey, it's Doobs.

1136
01:19:13,140 --> 01:19:14,140
Hey, Doobs.

1137
01:19:14,140 --> 01:19:15,140
What's up?

1138
01:19:15,140 --> 01:19:25,140
I was just bored and listening to you guys talk about the Goths, and it was so funny. As you guys were talking about that, I was reading Maddox. You guys ever heard of that guy?

1139
01:19:25,140 --> 01:19:29,140
Is that the one that makes fun of the pre-school freaker art on his site?

1140
01:19:29,140 --> 01:19:31,140
Yeah, that guy. That guy. He's hilarious.

1141
01:19:31,140 --> 01:19:33,140
Yeah, that's a pretty funny site.

1142
01:19:33,140 --> 01:19:39,140
Yeah, I was reading and he was talking about the Goths, and it's so funny. He just destroys them. It's hilarious.

1143
01:19:39,140 --> 01:19:50,140
Okay, now, to be fair, we're only teasing, you know, we like everybody equally.

1144
01:19:50,140 --> 01:19:52,140
Except emo kids. I mean, hi!

1145
01:19:52,140 --> 01:19:54,140
No, no, no.

1146
01:19:54,140 --> 01:19:56,140
I'm against the emo kids also, it's really funny.

1147
01:19:56,140 --> 01:19:59,140
Remember, down the road, not across the street!

1148
01:19:59,140 --> 01:20:02,140
I have a couple funny stories about the emo kids.

1149
01:20:02,140 --> 01:20:08,140
I know that, like, there's this arcade I go to normally, there's this kid who is just sitting on the ground, right?

1150
01:20:08,140 --> 01:20:11,900
And some cop guy just came up and told him, oh, you can't sit there.

1151
01:20:11,900 --> 01:20:16,180
So this kid just looks at the cop like, shoot him.

1152
01:20:16,180 --> 01:20:18,940
So he's like, god, OK, whatever, you know, I'll send you up.

1153
01:20:18,940 --> 01:20:21,940
And he starts like crying and runs away, like, what the hell?

1154
01:20:21,940 --> 01:20:23,020
You know what I don't understand?

1155
01:20:23,020 --> 01:20:24,900
This is one of those generational things.

1156
01:20:24,900 --> 01:20:26,860
This is when I really begin to feel old.

1157
01:20:26,860 --> 01:20:31,580
Because back in my day, they didn't have emo kids.

1158
01:20:31,580 --> 01:20:32,740
But this is why I don't understand.

1159
01:20:32,740 --> 01:20:34,540
Everybody says emo sucks.

1160
01:20:34,540 --> 01:20:35,620
Emo kids suck.

1161
01:20:35,620 --> 01:20:37,780
I've never heard anybody say,

1162
01:20:37,780 --> 01:20:39,060
I'm an emo kid,

1163
01:20:39,060 --> 01:20:41,380
leave me alone.

1164
01:20:41,380 --> 01:20:44,420
Nobody ever says that. I want to be emo when I grow up.

1165
01:20:44,420 --> 01:20:47,380
Seriously. Where are the emo kids?

1166
01:20:47,380 --> 01:20:49,260
Where are these people that suck?

1167
01:20:49,260 --> 01:20:53,500
I think you all are making fun of something that doesn't even exist.

1168
01:20:53,500 --> 01:20:57,140
Okay, no. Okay, if you want to see the emo kids, just like walk around I guess like a

1169
01:20:57,140 --> 01:20:58,260
mall or something

1170
01:20:58,260 --> 01:21:01,820
and look for kids looking at the floor all the time.

1171
01:21:01,820 --> 01:21:05,820
Can I shop at Hot Topic? They've got video game shirts, come on.

1172
01:21:05,820 --> 01:21:11,820
And Cool Pants. You've got to admit Hot Topic has cool pants. You don't have to be emo to know that.

1173
01:21:11,820 --> 01:21:16,820
Yeah, they're pretty cool. And I don't even like Hot Topic much.

1174
01:21:16,820 --> 01:21:21,820
Alright. Anything gaming related you wanted to share with us?

1175
01:21:21,820 --> 01:21:26,820
Yes. I got a bunch of triple A's today. I'm happy.

1176
01:21:26,820 --> 01:21:30,820
Congratulations. Now, how many new triple-A's did you get?

1177
01:21:30,820 --> 01:21:36,820
I got a triple-A on Holik, a triple-A Wakalaka, a triple-A on Sexy Planet.

1178
01:21:36,820 --> 01:21:38,820
That's not Megamix.

1179
01:21:38,820 --> 01:21:42,820
And I passed PSMO on Shuffle.

1180
01:21:42,820 --> 01:21:44,820
But that's not a triple-A. You just passed it.

1181
01:21:44,820 --> 01:21:46,820
No, I passed it, but that's awesome.

1182
01:21:46,820 --> 01:21:48,820
Okay, I know. So that's four.

1183
01:21:48,820 --> 01:21:52,820
So, your DDR penis grew by a whole four centimeters. How does it feel?

1184
01:21:52,820 --> 01:21:54,820
It feels great.

1185
01:21:54,820 --> 01:22:00,820
Okay. Alright. I'll see you guys later. Go hump something. See ya. Bye. Bye.

1186
01:22:00,820 --> 01:22:09,820
That's wonderful. I would, you know, Dr. Drew or something. Yeah, go hump something.

1187
01:22:09,820 --> 01:22:15,820
For better. Well, he's got his penis grew by four centimeters. It's time to go hump something.

1188
01:22:15,820 --> 01:22:20,820
Maybe he saw the new parasol pin. No, he triple A'd, weren't you listening?

1189
01:22:20,820 --> 01:22:25,860
Oh, I'm sorry. I was looking for something that actually made, you know...

1190
01:22:25,860 --> 01:22:30,300
I don't know. You ever sign up for one of those sites like NNR

1191
01:22:30,300 --> 01:22:33,900
or Groovestats, I think is another one for In the Groovestats?

1192
01:22:33,900 --> 01:22:37,700
Any of those sites where you can compare your DDR scores

1193
01:22:37,700 --> 01:22:40,660
and you can issue challenges to each other and stuff like that?

1194
01:22:40,660 --> 01:22:44,780
Challenge one, go outside.

1195
01:22:44,780 --> 01:22:50,660
Challenge one, run around the track.

1196
01:22:50,660 --> 01:23:04,180
track. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Hello? Housekeeping? Welcome to my castle.

1197
01:23:04,180 --> 01:23:12,860
Candygram. You are on the Orange Lounge. Seriously, you there? Can you hear us? I would be a negative.

1198
01:23:12,860 --> 01:23:18,420
Well, it's one of our regular callers. Oh, he hung up. If you kids are unsure if your

1199
01:23:18,420 --> 01:23:22,500
Skype is working or not give a echo one two three a call and you can always test

1200
01:23:22,500 --> 01:23:26,060
to make sure your schedule you can't add echo one two three three to your buddy

1201
01:23:26,060 --> 01:23:31,140
list but you can give echo one two three a call so give echo one two three a call

1202
01:23:31,140 --> 01:23:34,380
and you can test if your Skype is working and see what you sound like

1203
01:23:34,380 --> 01:23:41,460
amazing all right let's go to our cage match for tonight boys and girls oh wait

1204
01:23:41,460 --> 01:23:45,140
no no let's not because I was I was not done with the NNR and group stat thing

1205
01:23:45,140 --> 01:23:51,420
it okay please explain to me what the point is about all these challenges and

1206
01:23:51,420 --> 01:23:55,220
stuff like OMG I'm gonna challenge you on this song and I'm gonna be better

1207
01:23:55,220 --> 01:23:59,340
than you on this song I have no idea because people are fundamentally stupid

1208
01:23:59,340 --> 01:24:04,460
well I don't know I mean a lot of people do this like if I were to sign up for

1209
01:24:04,460 --> 01:24:09,500
something like that I would do it for myself to track my own records because I

1210
01:24:09,500 --> 01:24:14,060
believe it's the one place where in the groove really is superior to DER is the

1211
01:24:14,060 --> 01:24:19,820
memory support, where the memory card on PlayStation, that whole link thing, eh, not so hot. But

1212
01:24:19,820 --> 01:24:24,860
the USB in the groove is awesome. And so really with that, you don't need a freaking website

1213
01:24:24,860 --> 01:24:29,500
to track your scores, but on DDR you kind of do. So I could see myself signing up for

1214
01:24:29,500 --> 01:24:33,700
websites strictly to track my scores on DDR, to watch my own improvement, because it feels

1215
01:24:33,700 --> 01:24:37,780
good to watch yourself improve. But the whole like challenging other people and like OMG,

1216
01:24:37,780 --> 01:24:43,340
I got one more great than you and all that stuff, I don't get that. Who cares? Who cares?

1217
01:24:43,340 --> 01:24:47,340
No matter how good you are

1218
01:24:47,340 --> 01:24:51,660
at DDR, or at 2DX, or at Pop'n Music, or at any of these games,

1219
01:24:51,660 --> 01:24:56,620
or at Goth Dancing, or whatever, there will always be somebody better than you

1220
01:24:56,620 --> 01:25:00,740
somewhere out there. You may not know it, but somebody out there is better than you.

1221
01:25:00,740 --> 01:25:05,180
And the person who's the best in the world,

1222
01:25:05,180 --> 01:25:08,980
there's somebody better than them at something else.

1223
01:25:08,980 --> 01:25:12,460
That was my

1224
01:25:12,460 --> 01:25:19,260
motivational thought for today regardless somebody out there is better

1225
01:25:19,260 --> 01:25:27,180
than you so stop trying all right let's go to the cage match tonight boys and

1226
01:25:27,180 --> 01:25:30,880
girls we'll do more Skype calls later I think people are afraid to call in now

1227
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:34,860
because I I wasn't really making fun of that last guy I mean I was kind of

1228
01:25:34,860 --> 01:25:41,980
congratulating him I don't know what you guys problem is way away away all right

1229
01:25:41,980 --> 01:25:49,980
Um, we gotta go to the cage match. But in order for me to go to the cage match, I've gotta find, uh, Loki's song that he wanted played.

1230
01:25:52,980 --> 01:25:56,980
I hope I can find it, or we're in trouble. Do you remember what the file name was?

1231
01:25:57,980 --> 01:25:59,980
Um, I believe it started with a D.

1232
01:26:00,980 --> 01:26:01,980
Uh-oh.

1233
01:26:03,980 --> 01:26:06,980
Oh, God. Do I have to look it up again?

1234
01:26:06,980 --> 01:26:12,660
maybe this isn't good it's two letters it starts off as something something and

1235
01:26:12,660 --> 01:26:16,220
then dash all right let me I will look for that so that we don't waste too much

1236
01:26:16,220 --> 01:26:20,060
show let's just like I'm worried about I'm gonna reorder things a little bit

1237
01:26:20,060 --> 01:26:26,180
let's go into playing that song from Silent Hill 4 and this is one of the

1238
01:26:26,180 --> 01:26:30,540
songs that's in the new song packer I don't remember if it's song pack 10 or

1239
01:26:30,540 --> 01:26:33,740
11 I think it's on pack 10 this song shows up in and it's really weird you

1240
01:26:33,740 --> 01:26:38,460
you guys. This is a really weird song. And that's kind of the reason I want to play this.

1241
01:26:38,460 --> 01:26:44,340
They should put a dog song in there. So that you can hear kind of how weird some of these

1242
01:26:44,340 --> 01:26:50,180
DDR songs are getting. So this is Waver, the slide mix. And we'll be back after this with

1243
01:26:50,180 --> 01:26:57,180
the cage match

1244
01:29:50,180 --> 01:29:57,060
Believe it or not, that's from the new DDR song pack.

1245
01:29:57,060 --> 01:29:58,060
One of the new ones.

1246
01:29:58,060 --> 01:29:59,880
It's Waver, the slide mix.

1247
01:29:59,880 --> 01:30:02,000
Very odd Akira track there.

1248
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:03,000
You know what?

1249
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:07,060
The original was so much better, but totally not danceable.

1250
01:30:07,060 --> 01:30:09,040
It works for Silent Hill, I guess.

1251
01:30:09,040 --> 01:30:12,860
I could see that in a Silent Hill game, but for DDR, that's kind of weird.

1252
01:30:12,860 --> 01:30:16,920
But I have to admit, it was actually not so bad to dance to.

1253
01:30:16,920 --> 01:30:17,920
It's just different.

1254
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:23,920
But you can't say there isn't a little variety in your USDDR games, so there you have it.

1255
01:30:23,920 --> 01:30:30,600
Alright, um, before we get into tonight's cage match, I thought we'd go ahead and let

1256
01:30:30,600 --> 01:30:32,920
Loki do a sim update if you have something for us.

1257
01:30:32,920 --> 01:30:33,920
Loki?

1258
01:30:33,920 --> 01:30:34,920
That's a good question.

1259
01:30:34,920 --> 01:30:41,440
I don't think we do though, but at least last time I checked, which was yesterday, um, let's

1260
01:30:41,440 --> 01:30:42,440
give it a- oh!

1261
01:30:42,440 --> 01:30:47,880
I forgot, actually, I forgot one the other day, um, not that you really care, but guess

1262
01:30:47,880 --> 01:30:56,520
what step mania alpha something or other release candidate 3 came out and what

1263
01:30:56,520 --> 01:31:01,200
can you expect in that I don't know not much different but hey it's a new

1264
01:31:01,200 --> 01:31:05,280
version of step mania and I know what I completely forgot that they're even

1265
01:31:05,280 --> 01:31:10,320
updating that thing to be honest because it's been that long but yeah new version

1266
01:31:10,320 --> 01:31:15,800
get at stepmania.com be sure to you know upgrade it and I think there might be a

1267
01:31:15,800 --> 01:31:20,440
driver missing so you might have to download that too but um it's not that hard to find

1268
01:31:20,440 --> 01:31:25,640
i found it pretty quick but anyways um let's see what's going on in the sim scene because

1269
01:31:25,640 --> 01:31:31,880
i know as far as um uk stuff um ddr uk hasn't released the official packs yet but i think

1270
01:31:31,880 --> 01:31:37,280
they're getting pretty close there they have to just tweak a few things on um on them because

1271
01:31:37,280 --> 01:31:42,040
they actually ripped all the music and the images and all that stuff um using a certain

1272
01:31:42,040 --> 01:31:49,920
program but um let's see here well I'm not having much high hopes here for the

1273
01:31:49,920 --> 01:32:00,720
fan mix stuff but no nothing nada pretty much Siberia style 2.6 came out that was

1274
01:32:00,720 --> 01:32:04,720
the one that was very similar to techno fiend I actually downloaded and tried it

1275
01:32:04,720 --> 01:32:08,680
out it's pretty cool it actually works with this release candidate 3 so that's

1276
01:32:08,680 --> 01:32:14,200
pretty nice and then d3mix 2.5 four songs have been announced for that but

1277
01:32:14,200 --> 01:32:21,220
they haven't really launched anything and really if you want all the news like

1278
01:32:21,220 --> 01:32:26,220
no up-to-date and everything there's a website be music report they can go to

1279
01:32:26,220 --> 01:32:41,180
And really, there's nothing there. Ooh, wait a second. Hold on. Hmm, what have we here?

1280
01:32:41,180 --> 01:32:47,660
Apparently, I would be wrong. No, actually, they did announce something, or it looks like

1281
01:32:47,660 --> 01:32:55,540
there's screenshots of Food Mix 2. That's kind of neat. Just basically some screenshots

1282
01:32:55,540 --> 01:32:59,720
to show you what's going to be coming up, and if it's not a surprise, you know, it's

1283
01:32:59,720 --> 01:33:09,260
up to the same quality as the original Food Mix, if not better. So, take a look at that,

1284
01:33:09,260 --> 01:33:20,820
and more to come soon enough. Oh, a video. There's a video of Food Mix. So, we'll check

1285
01:33:20,820 --> 01:33:21,820
that out.

1286
01:33:21,820 --> 01:33:23,820
The videos will make great radio, by the way.

1287
01:33:23,820 --> 01:33:26,820
Well, I'm not going to play the video because it's on a different computer.

1288
01:33:26,820 --> 01:33:27,820
All right.

1289
01:33:27,820 --> 01:33:33,820
But anyways, if you're interested, you can go to http colon slash slash phone mix.

1290
01:33:33,820 --> 01:33:40,820
That's f-o-o-n-m-i-x dot nothing dot s-h.

1291
01:33:40,820 --> 01:33:45,820
I don't know what you know about these mixes here, but Laser123454321 in our chat room

1292
01:33:45,820 --> 01:33:50,820
is yelling about DDR9 Red has some early release version that's out.

1293
01:33:50,820 --> 01:33:59,820
DDR9 Red is basically the 2DX Red skin for, um, or theme for, um, StepMania.

1294
01:33:59,820 --> 01:34:02,820
And DDR Extreme VS4. I don't know what that one's all about.

1295
01:34:02,820 --> 01:34:04,820
It's just the DDR Extreme skin.

1296
01:34:04,820 --> 01:34:08,820
Oh, fun. More skins! More things to change in the workflow.

1297
01:34:08,820 --> 01:34:10,820
Skins, skins, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1298
01:34:10,820 --> 01:34:15,820
Honestly, folks, just stick with Siberia Style 2.6. It's the best one out there.

1299
01:34:15,820 --> 01:34:22,820
Actually, Technofeen, they were supposed to be doing some interesting stuff with that, so I'd have to check into that, too.

1300
01:34:22,820 --> 01:34:25,820
Because I know there's a few versions coming out, different colors and stuff.

1301
01:34:25,820 --> 01:34:27,820
So, it'll be interesting.

1302
01:34:27,820 --> 01:34:30,820
Alright, let's go into tonight's cage match, boys and girls.

1303
01:34:32,820 --> 01:34:35,820
The way the cage match works, we put three songs up against each other.

1304
01:34:35,820 --> 01:34:40,820
Last week's winner and two brand new ones. One song from each of us.

1305
01:34:40,820 --> 01:34:50,820
You have to be in our chat room to play www.orangeloungeradio.com, click on chat because it's your votes that determine who wins.

1306
01:34:50,820 --> 01:34:59,820
Last week we didn't have a cage match actually. For the first time in about 100 episodes we did not hold a cage match of any sort because we were too busy talking about E3.

1307
01:34:59,820 --> 01:35:06,300
so by default this song ended up getting a second week in rotation imagine that

1308
01:35:06,300 --> 01:35:11,660
so we'll see will it survive one more week and get closer to retirement on a

1309
01:35:11,660 --> 01:35:14,460
personal note I really hope not but we'll find out

1310
01:35:14,460 --> 01:35:20,860
Darth Punk is song number one Ted Koppel's gin and juice you voted it in

1311
01:35:20,860 --> 01:35:25,660
here it is a clip because it did win last time and then you'll get to hear

1312
01:35:25,660 --> 01:35:32,660
two new songs in their entirety. Here it is, Ted Koppel.

1313
01:35:55,660 --> 01:36:06,260
George's close to the White House today confirmed that the President is laid back

1314
01:36:06,260 --> 01:36:10,660
Now that I got me some Seagram's gin Everybody got they cups but they ain't chipped

1315
01:36:10,660 --> 01:36:13,660
in Now this types of shit happens all the time

1316
01:36:13,660 --> 01:36:18,300
You gotta get yours but fool I gotta get mine Everything is fine when you're listening to

1317
01:36:18,300 --> 01:36:21,820
the T.E.D. I got the cultivating music that be captivating

1318
01:36:21,820 --> 01:36:26,780
who listens to the words that I speak as I take me a drink to the middle of the

1319
01:36:26,780 --> 01:36:30,720
street and get to mackin' this bitch named Katie. Katie current? She used to be the

1320
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:35,620
homeboy's lady. Oh that bitch? 80 degrees when I tell that bitch please raise up off these

1321
01:36:35,620 --> 01:36:41,260
NUTs cause you get none of these at ease. As I mob with the dog pound field

1322
01:36:41,260 --> 01:36:45,180
that breathes biatch, I'm just.

1323
01:36:45,180 --> 01:36:55,900
earthquakes rocks Tokyo Japan today as residents were laid back residents in a

1324
01:36:55,900 --> 01:37:04,380
small New England town are terrified as a mass murderer is laid back later on

1325
01:37:04,380 --> 01:37:12,460
that day my homies all right that was a clip of song number one Darth Punk Ted

1326
01:37:12,460 --> 01:37:20,420
couple's gin and juice. Didn't that originate on something awful? I'm getting a nod, yes.

1327
01:37:20,420 --> 01:37:25,780
Yes, it is. Oh, that site's fun. I have vetoed putting that into the fortune cookie so many

1328
01:37:25,780 --> 01:37:33,100
times. That site is fun for the whole family. It is. Yeah, definitely. They should be showing

1329
01:37:33,100 --> 01:37:37,260
that website in Mormon churches everywhere. Alright, let's move on to song number two.

1330
01:37:37,260 --> 01:37:40,940
Song number two is my pick, my pick.

1331
01:37:40,940 --> 01:37:44,500
And I picked this song because it's a cover of ABBA.

1332
01:37:44,500 --> 01:37:46,340
And I can't get enough ABBA covers.

1333
01:37:46,340 --> 01:37:48,020
And this is actually from a new song.

1334
01:37:48,020 --> 01:37:50,940
I think it's supposed to showcase, like,

1335
01:37:50,940 --> 01:37:53,400
unknown dance artists, because it was called, like,

1336
01:37:53,400 --> 01:37:54,980
Future Dance or something like that.

1337
01:37:54,980 --> 01:37:56,780
And I never heard of anybody on the CD.

1338
01:37:56,780 --> 01:37:58,220
And this miss was actually pretty good.

1339
01:37:58,220 --> 01:37:59,020
I kind of liked it.

1340
01:37:59,020 --> 01:38:00,720
It's a little different, considering

1341
01:38:00,720 --> 01:38:02,540
the original song is very slow.

1342
01:38:02,540 --> 01:38:04,400
I liked what they did with this.

1343
01:38:04,400 --> 01:38:10,200
So this is DJ Tom Delsar with The Winner Takes It All 2005.

1344
01:38:10,200 --> 01:38:10,700
Enjoy!

1345
01:38:40,200 --> 01:38:47,200
I don't wanna talk About the things we've gone through

1346
01:38:47,200 --> 01:38:54,200
Oh, it's hurting me Now it's history

1347
01:38:54,200 --> 01:39:01,200
I've played all my cards If that's what you've done too

1348
01:39:01,200 --> 01:39:08,200
Nothing more to say No more race to play

1349
01:39:08,200 --> 01:39:12,200
The winner takes it all

1350
01:39:12,200 --> 01:39:15,200
We're lost and in small

1351
01:39:15,200 --> 01:39:19,200
Besides the victory

1352
01:39:19,200 --> 01:39:22,200
That's heard after me

1353
01:39:22,200 --> 01:39:26,200
I was in your love

1354
01:39:26,200 --> 01:39:29,200
Thinking I'd be lonely

1355
01:39:29,200 --> 01:39:33,200
I figured it'd make sense

1356
01:39:33,200 --> 01:39:36,200
Building me a fan

1357
01:39:36,200 --> 01:39:43,200
Building me a home, thinking I'd be strong there

1358
01:39:43,200 --> 01:39:50,200
But I was a fool, playing by the rules

1359
01:39:50,200 --> 01:39:57,200
The gas makes no one die, and my love's cold as ice

1360
01:39:57,200 --> 01:40:05,200
And someone's way down here, losing someone's ear

1361
01:40:05,200 --> 01:40:08,200
And it just takes it all

1362
01:40:08,200 --> 01:40:12,200
To make you have to fall

1363
01:40:12,200 --> 01:40:15,200
It seems I'm in this place

1364
01:40:15,200 --> 01:40:19,200
Why should I complain?

1365
01:40:21,200 --> 01:40:24,200
But tell me does she kiss

1366
01:40:24,200 --> 01:40:28,200
Like I used to kiss you

1367
01:40:28,200 --> 01:40:31,200
Does it feel the same

1368
01:40:31,200 --> 01:40:35,200
And when she calls your name

1369
01:40:35,200 --> 01:40:38,200
Somewhere deep inside

1370
01:40:38,200 --> 01:40:42,200
You must know I miss you

1371
01:40:42,200 --> 01:40:45,200
But what can I say?

1372
01:40:45,200 --> 01:40:49,200
Roots must be your bae

1373
01:40:49,200 --> 01:40:52,200
The churches when you die

1374
01:40:52,200 --> 01:40:56,200
The lights are clear by

1375
01:40:56,200 --> 01:40:59,200
The canes of the storm

1376
01:40:59,200 --> 01:41:06,200
Always sayin' love, the pain is gone again

1377
01:41:06,200 --> 01:41:13,200
Love won't understand, the same thing I just saw

1378
01:41:13,200 --> 01:41:17,200
The way that makes it all

1379
01:41:17,200 --> 01:41:24,200
I don't wanna talk, if it makes you feel sad

1380
01:41:24,200 --> 01:41:31,200
And I understand You've come to shake my hand

1381
01:41:31,200 --> 01:41:38,200
I apologize If it makes you feel bad

1382
01:41:38,200 --> 01:41:45,200
Seeing me so tense No self-confidence

1383
01:41:45,200 --> 01:41:47,200
But you'll see

1384
01:41:47,200 --> 01:41:54,200
The winner takes it all

1385
01:41:54,200 --> 01:42:02,200
The winner takes it all

1386
01:42:02,200 --> 01:42:06,200
oh

1387
01:42:06,200 --> 01:42:10,200
me

1388
01:42:10,200 --> 01:42:14,200
oh

1389
01:42:14,200 --> 01:42:18,200
me

1390
01:42:18,200 --> 01:42:22,200
oh

1391
01:42:22,200 --> 01:42:26,200
oh

1392
01:42:26,200 --> 01:42:30,200
me

1393
01:42:30,200 --> 01:42:46,640
Alrighty, that's song number two in tonight's cage match, DJ Tom Del Sar, the winner takes

1394
01:42:46,640 --> 01:42:47,640
it all 2005.

1395
01:42:47,640 --> 01:42:52,920
Did that song take it all or are you going to, I don't know, take a crap on it?

1396
01:42:52,920 --> 01:42:53,920
I don't know.

1397
01:42:53,920 --> 01:42:54,920
Let's see, Dark Sakura.

1398
01:42:54,920 --> 01:42:57,680
That song was really good for me to take a big old shit on.

1399
01:42:57,680 --> 01:43:03,680
I mean, it wasn't too bad. It's, again, trance. A very generic trance mix of that.

1400
01:43:03,680 --> 01:43:06,680
And the original was so good, I guess, you know, I like Gaba.

1401
01:43:06,680 --> 01:43:11,680
But that gets a five. It was just mediocre. Not exciting.

1402
01:43:11,680 --> 01:43:12,680
Loki.

1403
01:43:12,680 --> 01:43:16,680
I could've sworn I've heard that song before, like, just as another trance riff.

1404
01:43:16,680 --> 01:43:20,680
It's very similar to Erotic's version. It's not...

1405
01:43:20,680 --> 01:43:23,680
They do some different things with the vocals, but it's somewhat similar.

1406
01:43:23,680 --> 01:43:30,680
p0k3smot42o i like it, its abun, since aba is a bunch of fuckers and they are never going to reunite thats the best thing we are going to get

1407
01:43:53,680 --> 01:43:57,920
and that was fine, but this one was just a little too long for me, so I give it an eight.

1408
01:43:58,560 --> 01:44:03,680
Uh, all right, let's go on to song number three, Dark Sakura. What'd you pick for us tonight?

1409
01:44:03,680 --> 01:44:06,800
I've been wanting to put this song in the cage match for the past three months.

1410
01:44:07,920 --> 01:44:12,640
Finally, now that Demon Days has been released, I can legally put this song in the cage match,

1411
01:44:12,640 --> 01:44:16,160
so it's Gorillaz with Dare, which is actually going to be the next single.

1412
01:44:17,360 --> 01:44:20,800
All right, here it is, a sneak peek at the next single from Gorillaz, and it's Jamie's

1413
01:44:20,800 --> 01:44:27,800
cage match pick, DARE song number three. Enjoy!

1414
01:44:50,800 --> 01:44:58,800
On you, you just think that that's what you really want

1415
01:44:58,800 --> 01:45:02,800
Hold it down, baby

1416
01:45:04,800 --> 01:45:08,800
Just feel the moment when you feel

1417
01:45:08,800 --> 01:45:14,800
Jump back and forth, feel like you really want

1418
01:45:14,800 --> 01:45:16,800
I can't get enough

1419
01:45:22,800 --> 01:45:24,800
Never take no harm

1420
01:45:24,800 --> 01:45:26,800
Never take no harm

1421
01:45:29,800 --> 01:45:31,800
It's a day

1422
01:45:31,800 --> 01:45:36,800
Call me up, call me up, call me up, call me up, call me up

1423
01:45:36,800 --> 01:45:37,800
It's a day

1424
01:45:45,800 --> 01:45:46,800
It's a day

1425
01:45:54,800 --> 01:45:57,800
You've got depression on you

1426
01:45:57,800 --> 01:46:08,800
You just make it, that's what you do baby, hold it down, yeah

1427
01:46:09,800 --> 01:46:23,800
Just feel the moment, just like before, feel like you were laying yourself, working out

1428
01:46:53,800 --> 01:46:56,800
It's comin' up, it's comin' up, it's comin' up

1429
01:46:56,800 --> 01:46:59,800
It's the goal

1430
01:46:59,800 --> 01:47:03,800
You've got to press it on you

1431
01:47:03,800 --> 01:47:09,800
You just think it's that's what you do, baby

1432
01:47:09,800 --> 01:47:15,800
Hold it down, yeah

1433
01:47:15,800 --> 01:47:19,800
Jump real slow and move it

1434
01:47:19,800 --> 01:47:27,800
Come back before you feel like you were letting yourself work it out

1435
01:47:31,800 --> 01:47:34,800
You've got the pressure on you

1436
01:47:35,800 --> 01:47:40,800
You just appreciate that's what you do baby

1437
01:47:41,800 --> 01:47:44,800
Hoping that I will stay

1438
01:47:44,800 --> 01:48:00,800
Jump with it all and move it Jump back and forth, it feels like you will make yourself work it out

1439
01:48:14,800 --> 01:48:36,360
All right, song number three in tonight's cage match, Gorillaz Dare.

1440
01:48:36,360 --> 01:48:39,080
I dare you to tell me if you liked it or hated it.

1441
01:48:39,080 --> 01:48:40,080
Dark Sakura.

1442
01:48:40,080 --> 01:48:41,080
Ten.

1443
01:48:41,080 --> 01:48:42,080
Of course.

1444
01:48:42,080 --> 01:48:43,080
Gorillaz.

1445
01:48:43,080 --> 01:48:44,080
Any reason?

1446
01:48:44,080 --> 01:48:48,080
Actually, this is one of the better tracks on the new CD.

1447
01:48:48,080 --> 01:48:53,080
It's definitely the most upbeat track on the whole CD, because most everything else is really dark.

1448
01:48:53,080 --> 01:48:56,080
But this one was really cool, and it was...

1449
01:48:56,080 --> 01:49:02,080
What's-his-name from the Happy Mondays is one of the other collaborators on that track.

1450
01:49:02,080 --> 01:49:04,080
It's pretty cool.

1451
01:49:04,080 --> 01:49:07,080
All right, Loki.

1452
01:49:07,080 --> 01:49:11,080
It was pretty funky. I'd give it an 8.

1453
01:49:11,080 --> 01:49:17,400
it funky eight that's it all right Bradley I like the girl is on one on one

1454
01:49:17,400 --> 01:49:23,200
track it didn't really get didn't really catch my attention very well I'll give

1455
01:49:23,200 --> 01:49:29,160
it a seven for now um I you know what I actually really like that song and if I

1456
01:49:29,160 --> 01:49:35,040
think more of the gorillas music sounded like that I'd probably be as much of a

1457
01:49:35,040 --> 01:49:41,600
a fan as Jamie is so I kind of wish they do more of that sound so I'm kind of

1458
01:49:41,600 --> 01:49:44,120
excited that it's the next single because some of the remixes ought to be

1459
01:49:44,120 --> 01:49:49,920
good so I will give that song I'm at the same time though I'm starting to get a

1460
01:49:49,920 --> 01:49:52,880
little burned out on gorillas and gorillas related things in the cage

1461
01:49:52,880 --> 01:49:58,680
match so I really hope I know it was Sean Ryder that's why that's why I'm

1462
01:49:58,680 --> 01:50:02,200
gonna give it a five but and I'm not gonna dock at any point so I'm gonna go

1463
01:50:02,200 --> 01:50:09,200
ahead and give it a nine. Alright, let's go ahead and recap, and then it will be your

1464
01:50:09,280 --> 01:50:13,080
turn to vote. So here it is, the three songs you can vote for tonight. Song number one,

1465
01:50:13,080 --> 01:50:16,760
last week's winner, Darth Punk, Ted Koppel's Gin and Juice.

1466
01:50:16,760 --> 01:50:21,760
Well, today confirmed that the President is laid back with the mind of the money and the

1467
01:50:21,760 --> 01:50:23,800
money of the money. Now that I guess.

1468
01:50:23,800 --> 01:50:27,800
Song number two, DJ Tom Delsar, The Winner Takes It All, 2005.

1469
01:50:27,800 --> 01:50:40,160
And song number three you can vote for tonight is Gorillaz Dare.

1470
01:50:40,160 --> 01:50:54,200
All right place votes now send a private

1471
01:50:54,200 --> 01:51:00,080
message to Sky in the chatroom with your vote for song number one, song number two, or song

1472
01:51:00,080 --> 01:51:05,320
number three. We'll tally him up and let you know who won. So send that private message

1473
01:51:05,320 --> 01:51:09,240
in now. You don't have much time. No dilly dallying.

1474
01:51:09,240 --> 01:51:14,240
Oh. Yes, Loki. I'd like to mention I did watch

1475
01:51:14,240 --> 01:51:22,840
the video. It's of a new song called Manhole, and that's like, you know, Manhole in street.

1476
01:51:22,840 --> 01:51:30,760
know not as in, you know, something else. Anyways, it, oh man, FoodMix2 looks awesome.

1477
01:51:30,760 --> 01:51:37,240
The interface is really cool and the videos are just about as good as they were last time,

1478
01:51:37,240 --> 01:51:42,320
so definitely one to try out once it comes out. But in the meantime, you'll just have

1479
01:51:42,320 --> 01:51:45,400
to live vicariously through the video. The weird thing about that video, on what website

1480
01:51:45,400 --> 01:51:53,120
can they get the video on? This is on, it's http colon slash slash food mix and that's

1481
01:51:53,120 --> 01:52:02,200
F-O-O-N-M-I-X, all one word, dot nothing dot S-H and there'll be the link on the top there

1482
01:52:02,200 --> 01:52:12,440
it'll say, so that's food mix dot nothing dot shh, yeah, that's shh, shh, shh, it. Exactly.

1483
01:52:12,440 --> 01:52:18,600
And they basically have a 20 meg video you can download plus five screen captures.

1484
01:52:18,600 --> 01:52:23,940
And you can check out the brand new song which is pretty good but I didn't get to listen

1485
01:52:23,940 --> 01:52:28,480
to it when it was playing because we had other music going at the same time.

1486
01:52:28,480 --> 01:52:31,360
But it looks pretty cool.

1487
01:52:31,360 --> 01:52:33,640
And go check it out.

1488
01:52:33,640 --> 01:52:36,960
Now what amazed me most about that video, the little bits that I saw kind of watching

1489
01:52:36,960 --> 01:52:41,920
over your shoulder there is that it appears that it has solo steps.

1490
01:52:41,920 --> 01:52:47,680
Oh yeah, how many people actually take the time to create solo steps?

1491
01:52:47,680 --> 01:52:50,360
Oh, now you're playing it over there, huh?

1492
01:52:50,360 --> 01:52:54,400
Well, I'm playing the music, but it's got this, like, little pig-bunny thing

1493
01:52:54,400 --> 01:52:57,560
ring around the background and looks pretty cool.

1494
01:52:57,560 --> 01:52:59,600
I really like the way Food Mix is put together.

1495
01:52:59,600 --> 01:53:02,280
I think it is one of the superior mixes.

1496
01:53:02,280 --> 01:53:04,360
Of course, I haven't looked at a whole lot,

1497
01:53:04,360 --> 01:53:10,320
but I think it is one of the better ones out there.

1498
01:53:10,320 --> 01:53:12,720
This is a weird song, too.

1499
01:53:12,720 --> 01:53:19,720
Can you put the mic up to the speakers so they can hear a little bit of that?

1500
01:53:36,600 --> 01:53:37,840
Interesting.

1501
01:53:37,840 --> 01:53:39,040
A little funky.

1502
01:53:39,040 --> 01:53:41,080
what's the name of that song

1503
01:53:41,080 --> 01:53:42,100
manhole

1504
01:53:42,100 --> 01:53:45,320
that's just bizarre manhole

1505
01:53:45,320 --> 01:53:49,200
and uh... yeah there's a manhole but it was great though and I'm going to fast forward it here into like the

1506
01:53:49,200 --> 01:53:50,320
end

1507
01:53:50,320 --> 01:53:51,600
teehee

1508
01:53:51,600 --> 01:53:54,280
manhole

1509
01:53:54,280 --> 01:53:56,400
but they have like really cool thing

1510
01:53:56,400 --> 01:54:01,000
like a little spinny flower thing and then

1511
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:04,280
and then uh... they have like they're just their backgrounds and stuff they have a lot of

1512
01:54:04,280 --> 01:54:08,320
animation going on the menus and stuff and that's what's pretty cool about it

1513
01:54:08,320 --> 01:54:11,040
I think at least.

1514
01:54:11,040 --> 01:54:12,800
It looks pretty cool.

1515
01:54:12,800 --> 01:54:15,720
Anyways, so just go check it out.

1516
01:54:15,720 --> 01:54:21,720
Alrighty, last call for CAGEMATCH votes. Get those in right now or your vote won't count.

1517
01:54:21,720 --> 01:54:23,920
Na na na na na.

1518
01:54:23,920 --> 01:54:27,320
I don't think we talked about this a whole lot last week. Pump It Up,

1519
01:54:27,320 --> 01:54:31,440
the brand new thing coming out there, Mad Catz is publishing it.

1520
01:54:31,440 --> 01:54:35,600
A whole shitload of songs is going to be in the new release of Pump It Up

1521
01:54:35,600 --> 01:54:36,920
coming out here in the US.

1522
01:54:36,920 --> 01:54:42,380
Now, I know a lot of the DDR Freak people went and got to take a look at this. Did you go, too, Dark Sakura?

1523
01:54:42,380 --> 01:54:43,940
No.

1524
01:54:43,940 --> 01:54:46,620
I don't care about Pump It Up.

1525
01:54:46,620 --> 01:54:49,580
I would have gone, just to check it out, but okay.

1526
01:54:49,580 --> 01:54:51,460
Um...

1527
01:54:51,460 --> 01:54:53,380
But what about Run To You?

1528
01:54:53,380 --> 01:54:56,920
Bounce With Me, Bounce With Me. Not even in there. I know, and it's not even in there. And that's the

1529
01:54:56,920 --> 01:54:58,320
first thing I noticed, too. I'm like,

1530
01:54:58,320 --> 01:55:04,180
where the fuck is Run To You? What's the point anymore? What's the point? How can you have Pump It Up? They've drained the lifeblood from Pump It Up

1531
01:55:04,180 --> 01:55:06,120
in the form of Run To You.

1532
01:55:06,120 --> 01:55:08,120
I recommend that for the next break, by the way.

1533
01:55:08,120 --> 01:55:11,120
At least they have Beethoven's Virus.

1534
01:55:11,120 --> 01:55:13,120
Beethoven's Virus is a really...

1535
01:55:13,120 --> 01:55:15,120
Even if it used to be a ringtone on my phone.

1536
01:55:15,120 --> 01:55:17,120
People whore the shit out of that song, but it's still really good.

1537
01:55:17,120 --> 01:55:18,120
It's kind of tough, too.

1538
01:55:18,120 --> 01:55:20,120
And they do have Funky Tonight.

1539
01:55:20,120 --> 01:55:21,120
So that's kind of cool.

1540
01:55:21,120 --> 01:55:23,120
Yeah, but no DJ Dot.

1541
01:55:23,120 --> 01:55:24,120
But this is what's really interesting.

1542
01:55:24,120 --> 01:55:27,120
They actually put K-pop in a US release.

1543
01:55:27,120 --> 01:55:28,120
I think that's kind of neat.

1544
01:55:28,120 --> 01:55:30,120
I don't know why, but I think that's neat.

1545
01:55:30,120 --> 01:55:34,120
But of course, then again, if you look at DDR, they do have some J-pop songs.

1546
01:55:34,120 --> 01:55:37,560
they don't bother translating like the B4U stuff, you know, it's kind of neat.

1547
01:55:37,560 --> 01:55:43,560
You need to put in like, you know, some more inflow. You know, it's not capable.

1548
01:55:43,560 --> 01:55:50,160
Well this is really weird, and then they mix that with US pop. Elvis, A Little Less Conversation.

1549
01:55:50,160 --> 01:55:53,200
Why does A Little Less Conversation have to be in every single music game?

1550
01:55:53,200 --> 01:55:57,560
I don't know. Earth Wind and Fire, Let's Groove, The Crystal Method, Name of the Game.

1551
01:55:57,560 --> 01:56:00,480
Okay, that's pretty awesome.

1552
01:56:00,480 --> 01:56:03,040
Sugarhill Gang, Rapper's Delight.

1553
01:56:03,040 --> 01:56:06,380
I am glad that they have, that's actually pretty sweet right there.

1554
01:56:06,380 --> 01:56:08,400
And then a bunch of other songs I've never heard of.

1555
01:56:08,400 --> 01:56:11,640
They need to put Name of the Game in fucking DDR.

1556
01:56:11,640 --> 01:56:13,280
Make like a hardcore DDR mix.

1557
01:56:13,280 --> 01:56:17,560
Well didn't they have Busy Child or what song was in Max 2?

1558
01:56:17,560 --> 01:56:18,560
Was it Busy Child?

1559
01:56:18,560 --> 01:56:19,560
It was Busy Child.

1560
01:56:19,560 --> 01:56:24,920
But Name of the Game has, you know, the kickass, Name of the Game, that song needs to be in

1561
01:56:24,920 --> 01:56:25,920
Beatmania.

1562
01:56:25,920 --> 01:56:29,960
If you want to put licensed songs in Beatmania, that song right there, cause it has tons of

1563
01:56:29,960 --> 01:56:33,960
crazy scratching and that would be perfect. Perfect.

1564
01:56:33,960 --> 01:56:37,960
Alright. You kids want to hear who won tonight's cage match?

1565
01:56:37,960 --> 01:56:41,960
Yes please, yes let's. Alright. Uh, it was another one

1566
01:56:41,960 --> 01:56:45,960
that came down to one freaking vote.

1567
01:56:45,960 --> 01:56:49,960
So if you think your votes don't count, you're full of crap.

1568
01:56:49,960 --> 01:56:53,960
Your votes count more than the US elections.

1569
01:56:53,960 --> 01:56:57,960
Your votes count more than any of ours

1570
01:56:57,960 --> 01:57:02,720
too, remember. Because even though we rate the songs here, we go all Simon Cowell on

1571
01:57:02,720 --> 01:57:07,960
them, they don't really count in the end. It's your votes that count. So the winning

1572
01:57:07,960 --> 01:57:12,960
song by one vote... Oh, yes, I want to mention something real quick.

1573
01:57:12,960 --> 01:57:19,600
Since you mentioned Simon Cowell, brand new American Idol type thing that's going to be

1574
01:57:19,600 --> 01:57:25,960
going on, but dancing this time. Oh, hooray, I'm so excited. Do you think any

1575
01:57:25,960 --> 01:57:30,800
DDR players will be in on that nope no all right I just thought I'd mention it

1576
01:57:30,800 --> 01:57:35,580
because you know one it delays finding out who won and two it sort of had you

1577
01:57:35,580 --> 01:57:41,360
know you know a little bit of can I get to the cage much want to know I guess

1578
01:57:42,440 --> 01:57:52,240
gorillas dare one love you chat room one vote over the abbot cover I love you

1579
01:57:52,240 --> 01:57:55,800
chat room hey good people didn't have the good taste not to vote for Ted

1580
01:57:55,800 --> 01:58:01,200
Yes, Ted Koppel, and then on the other side of that, the Ted Koppel song got one vote.

1581
01:58:01,200 --> 01:58:03,600
I wonder who voted.

1582
01:58:03,600 --> 01:58:07,720
We need to find that person and be the other side of the hill with the wet-rolled-up newspaper.

1583
01:58:07,720 --> 01:58:11,600
They actually said in their vote, and I already closed the window, so I forget who did it,

1584
01:58:11,600 --> 01:58:15,960
but they actually said in their vote, I'm voting for it because nobody else is going

1585
01:58:15,960 --> 01:58:16,960
to vote.

1586
01:58:16,960 --> 01:58:18,860
How prophetic.

1587
01:58:18,860 --> 01:58:21,920
We have ourselves a psychic in here.

1588
01:58:21,920 --> 01:58:27,920
Alright, um, okay.

1589
01:58:27,920 --> 01:58:35,680
I am happy, I am pleased as punch, to quote an old expression from the 50s, I am pleased

1590
01:58:35,680 --> 01:58:39,720
as punch that Jin and Jus is the fuck out of there now.

1591
01:58:39,720 --> 01:58:44,720
And the heavens parted, and the choir of angels came forth and said, woohoo!

1592
01:58:44,720 --> 01:58:47,040
Loki, don't you ever do that again!

1593
01:58:47,040 --> 01:58:49,480
Oh, don't worry, it's coming back.

1594
01:58:49,480 --> 01:58:51,080
I'll stick the puppy dogs on you.

1595
01:58:51,080 --> 01:58:54,760
Oh, we'll make a remix of that and girls or something, you know?

1596
01:58:54,760 --> 01:58:58,000
Oh, Christ.

1597
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:01,340
No, anyways. Speaking of remixes.

1598
01:59:01,340 --> 01:59:05,240
Let's go to a break, boys and girls. Let's play my song! Yeah, what song am I going to play?

1599
01:59:05,240 --> 01:59:08,920
I was going to do the dancing stage stuff, but we can do your song.

1600
01:59:08,920 --> 01:59:12,200
You can play the dancing stage stuff then, that's fine. Alright, what song?

1601
01:59:12,200 --> 01:59:15,880
Oh, all of these on here that I haven't... Okay, wow.

1602
01:59:15,880 --> 01:59:19,400
Okay, so we got this Blondie song. Here, I'll pick some good ones out for you.

1603
01:59:19,400 --> 01:59:21,960
Okay, please do. Okay, let's do... Is this the...

1604
01:59:21,960 --> 01:59:25,600
Oh, is this that song that I think it is? It is? Yes, I want that one. Except there's no...

1605
01:59:25,600 --> 01:59:29,240
not really many lyrics in that. Oh, sucks. And then, um...

1606
01:59:29,240 --> 01:59:33,460
Get It On. Okay. That'd be good. And... So we're gonna play I See You Baby,

1607
01:59:33,460 --> 01:59:36,720
Get It On. And maybe, um, Some Girls Are Super...

1608
01:59:36,720 --> 01:59:40,080
Yeah, that's super good. And then, we'll do Four. So, All Right as well?

1609
01:59:40,080 --> 01:59:43,800
Um, oh, oh, oh, um, actually Circles. Okay.

1610
01:59:43,800 --> 01:59:46,440
So we're gonna hear music, and what's the name of this game again? I can never...

1611
01:59:46,440 --> 01:59:51,560
Stage Unleashed 2 it's your European version of Ultramix 2. Oh very cool, very

1612
01:59:51,560 --> 01:59:56,220

1613
01:59:56,220 --> 02:00:03,360

1614
02:00:03,360 --> 02:00:07,740

1615
02:00:07,740 --> 02:00:11,620

This is the house that funk feels, group of mama style

Oh my god, look who's screaming

1630
02:02:35,620 --> 02:02:37,620
The stairs looking firewood

1631
02:02:37,620 --> 02:02:41,620
No color, people hop on the road

1632
02:02:41,620 --> 02:02:43,620
But it truly outtakes you

1633
02:02:43,620 --> 02:02:45,620
It's real fucking loud

1634
02:02:45,620 --> 02:02:48,620
I wanna hear my voice over the radio

02:02:48,620 --> 02:02:52,620

1658
02:04:10,980 --> 02:04:11,980
He calls me when he wants

1659
02:04:11,980 --> 02:04:12,980
Hey!

1660
02:04:12,980 --> 02:04:13,980
I've got a pair of zippered boobs

1661
02:04:13,980 --> 02:04:14,980
I go and shake my hair and loose

1662
02:04:14,980 --> 02:04:15,980
I never take my eyes off you

1663
02:04:15,980 --> 02:04:16,980
Oh no no, oh no no

1664
02:04:16,980 --> 02:04:17,980
No I don't think so

1665
02:04:17,980 --> 02:04:18,980
Oh no no no

1666
02:04:18,980 --> 02:04:19,980
I'm waking up

1667
02:04:19,980 --> 02:04:20,980
I'm waking up

1668
02:04:20,980 --> 02:04:21,980
I'm waking up

1669
02:04:21,980 --> 02:04:22,980
I'm waking up

1670
02:04:22,980 --> 02:04:23,980
I'm waking up

1671
02:04:23,980 --> 02:04:24,980
I'm waking up

1672
02:04:24,980 --> 02:04:31,980
I don't shake my hair, I don't lose I never take my eyes off you

1673
02:04:31,980 --> 02:04:35,980
I don't know, I don't know, no I don't think so

1674
02:04:35,980 --> 02:04:39,980
Ooh, love don't always get like the one I wanna

1675
02:04:39,980 --> 02:04:44,980
All I think you get is the other

1676
02:04:44,980 --> 02:04:47,980
Dreams are number one, let's forget them

1677
02:04:47,980 --> 02:04:52,980
It's the only way to make you feel better

1678
02:04:56,980 --> 02:04:59,980
Get loose and fancy free

1679
02:05:03,980 --> 02:05:06,980
My baby waits for me

1680
02:05:10,980 --> 02:05:13,980
He likes to put his own red coat on

1681
02:05:13,980 --> 02:05:17,980
He wants to tell me the things he's done

1682
02:05:17,980 --> 02:05:20,980
Such a strange way of having fun

1683
02:05:20,980 --> 02:05:22,980
No, no, no, oh, no, no

1684
02:05:22,980 --> 02:05:24,980
Anyway we go

1685
02:05:24,980 --> 02:05:27,980
Ooh, love can always get worse

1686
02:05:27,980 --> 02:05:29,980
And on and on

1687
02:05:29,980 --> 02:05:31,980
It seems to get way too bad

1688
02:05:31,980 --> 02:05:33,980
All you can say is

1689
02:05:33,980 --> 02:05:35,980
Love can always get worse

1690
02:05:35,980 --> 02:05:37,980
All you can say is

1691
02:05:37,980 --> 02:05:39,980
Love can always get worse

1692
02:05:39,980 --> 02:05:42,980
Love can always get worse

1693
02:05:42,980 --> 02:05:50,180
All that we need to get is the other other dreams of number one

1694
02:05:50,180 --> 02:05:56,980
Less forever it's the only way to make you feel better

1695
02:05:56,980 --> 02:05:58,980
You're just my good time

1696
02:05:58,980 --> 02:06:19,980
You're just my good time You're just my bad time

1697
02:06:28,980 --> 02:06:30,980
You got me screaming my calls

1698
02:06:32,980 --> 02:06:34,980
Seeing nowhere at all

1699
02:06:35,980 --> 02:06:37,980
You got me so obsessed

1700
02:06:39,980 --> 02:06:41,980
And way over my head

1701
02:06:44,980 --> 02:06:46,980
Just one good try

1702
02:06:48,980 --> 02:06:50,980
Just one good try

1703
02:06:51,980 --> 02:06:53,980
Just one good try

1704
02:06:55,980 --> 02:06:56,980
Just one good try

1705
02:06:56,980 --> 02:07:01,980
Didn't mean to make you paranoid When I'm the lady of the boy

1706
02:07:01,980 --> 02:07:06,980
Have to leave you like a boy Don't have to over-analyze

1707
02:07:06,980 --> 02:07:11,980
I'll just have fun with other guys You should listen to this advice

1708
02:07:11,980 --> 02:07:19,980
You're just my good time You're just my poor time

1709
02:07:19,980 --> 02:07:25,980
You're just my good time You're just my poor time

1710
02:07:25,980 --> 02:07:43,980
You're just my good time You're just my good time

1711
02:07:55,980 --> 02:07:57,980
radio

1712
02:07:59,820 --> 02:08:01,780
We're back boys and girls

1713
02:08:01,780 --> 02:08:03,780
So what do you think did the Brits get better?

1714
02:08:04,740 --> 02:08:09,780
On the Xbox second mix it sounds a lot better. They got some fun stuff

1715
02:08:10,460 --> 02:08:14,100
You know I agreed that they have some fun stuff, but I don't think they have it any better

1716
02:08:14,100 --> 02:08:17,580
I just think it's I think it's the same. I prefer that to

1717
02:08:19,220 --> 02:08:21,220
I'm not gonna say cause I'm nice

1718
02:08:21,220 --> 02:08:22,220
Bucky?

1719
02:08:22,220 --> 02:08:23,220
I don't know.

1720
02:08:23,220 --> 02:08:28,220
I like some of their club music, but I don't like the Blondie.

1721
02:08:28,220 --> 02:08:30,220
Blondie can stay far away.

1722
02:08:30,220 --> 02:08:31,220
Blondie's cool.

1723
02:08:31,220 --> 02:08:34,220
Yeah, Blondie's cool in the 80s.

1724
02:08:34,220 --> 02:08:37,220
Blondie's not cool now.

1725
02:08:37,220 --> 02:08:39,220
I don't know.

1726
02:08:39,220 --> 02:08:41,220
Remember Maria?

1727
02:08:41,220 --> 02:08:44,220
From the late 90s when they reunited?

1728
02:08:44,220 --> 02:08:45,220
Maria!

1729
02:08:45,220 --> 02:08:47,220
I don't need video.

1730
02:08:47,220 --> 02:08:57,220
I don't know, I actually do think the top of Blondie's popularity was about Rapture.

1731
02:08:57,220 --> 02:08:58,220
Rapture.

1732
02:08:58,220 --> 02:09:05,500
It's a little stupid rap about the aliens.

1733
02:09:05,500 --> 02:09:10,660
Do you know that Rapture was like the first rap song or whatever to top the billboard

1734
02:09:10,660 --> 02:09:11,660
or something like that?

1735
02:09:11,660 --> 02:09:13,940
It like was a pop song that had rap in it.

1736
02:09:13,940 --> 02:09:17,940
I know, but they say it was the first rap song to ever top the charts.

1737
02:09:17,940 --> 02:09:21,940
I'm like, dude, when I think of rap, I don't think of Debra Harry.

1738
02:09:21,940 --> 02:09:25,940
It's all about Grandmaster Flash. I think of Tupac.

1739
02:09:25,940 --> 02:09:29,940
No, no, no, no, you need to go older.

1740
02:09:29,940 --> 02:09:33,940
It's all about the message.

1741
02:09:33,940 --> 02:09:39,940
How about, um, the dude, how about Flava Flav when he used to wear the huge clock around his neck?

1742
02:09:39,940 --> 02:09:42,940
I had, I had some, um, public enemy in the pre-show.

1743
02:09:42,940 --> 02:09:43,940
Oh, I know, I know.

1744
02:09:43,940 --> 02:09:44,940
I put 9-1-1 as a joke in there.

1745
02:09:44,940 --> 02:09:46,940
Flavor Flav!

1746
02:09:46,940 --> 02:09:51,940
Then he started hanging out with Brigitte Nielsen, who wondered about the house naked.

1747
02:09:51,940 --> 02:09:53,940
That was my Flavor Flav impersonation, by the way.

1748
02:09:53,940 --> 02:09:55,940
Flavor Flav!

1749
02:09:55,940 --> 02:09:58,940
Okay, I'm gonna go hide behind the chair now, thank you.

1750
02:09:58,940 --> 02:10:01,940
Come on, tell me, tell me that's not a good impression.

1751
02:10:01,940 --> 02:10:03,940
Flavor Flav!

1752
02:10:03,940 --> 02:10:04,940
Well, I'm traumatized now.

1753
02:10:04,940 --> 02:10:06,940
Hey, to get you to stop saying Flavor Flav,

1754
02:10:06,940 --> 02:10:15,980
slave, I'd like to interject this random moment of trivia. I've just read that Woot, W-0-0-T,

1755
02:10:15,980 --> 02:10:18,140
is the third favorite non-dictionary word.

1756
02:10:18,140 --> 02:10:20,740
What's the first two?

1757
02:10:20,740 --> 02:10:21,740
That's a good question.

1758
02:10:21,740 --> 02:10:26,940
In what sense that's used on web tools?

1759
02:10:26,940 --> 02:10:31,500
Ginormous was number one and confuzzled was number two.

1760
02:10:31,500 --> 02:10:32,500
Me so confuzzled.

1761
02:10:32,500 --> 02:10:34,540
Followed by Chillax.

1762
02:10:34,540 --> 02:10:35,740
What the hell did they scan?

1763
02:10:35,740 --> 02:10:36,740
I've never heard that one.

1764
02:10:36,740 --> 02:10:40,700
Chill, chillax which means chill out slash relax.

1765
02:10:40,700 --> 02:10:42,300
I'm going to go chillax.

1766
02:10:42,300 --> 02:10:43,300
Never heard it.

1767
02:10:43,300 --> 02:10:44,300
Did they, did they.

1768
02:10:44,300 --> 02:10:45,380
Cognitive dysplasia.

1769
02:10:45,380 --> 02:10:47,140
Where the hell did they get these words?

1770
02:10:47,140 --> 02:10:49,100
Did they scam people's live journals or something?

1771
02:10:49,100 --> 02:10:50,260
No, it was a contest.

1772
02:10:50,260 --> 02:10:51,260
It was like.

1773
02:10:51,260 --> 02:10:52,260
DDR freak.

1774
02:10:52,260 --> 02:10:58,900
Um, cognitive dysplasia was um, the feeling that you have before you even leave the house

1775
02:10:58,900 --> 02:11:01,020
that you're going to forget something about.

1776
02:11:01,020 --> 02:11:02,020
You're right.

1777
02:11:02,020 --> 02:11:03,740
That's a total DDR freak post.

1778
02:11:03,740 --> 02:11:06,540
But cognitive is actually a word.

1779
02:11:06,540 --> 02:11:11,300
Can someone explain for me why they won't put Japanese songs on American DDR? I'm so

1780
02:11:11,300 --> 02:11:12,300
confuzzled.

1781
02:11:12,300 --> 02:11:15,060
I don't know. Then they have OMG REACH PACK.

1782
02:11:15,060 --> 02:11:22,020
Followed by number six is GRIPTION. You know, my tires need GRIPTION, and PHONECRASTINATE

1783
02:11:22,020 --> 02:11:28,860
means putting off answering the phone until it displays on caller ID. SLICKERY, having

1784
02:11:28,860 --> 02:11:39,260
a service that is wet or icy, snurt, snow that is dirty, and lingweeny, a person incapable

1785
02:11:39,260 --> 02:11:42,300
of producing neoglisms or something like that.

1786
02:11:42,300 --> 02:11:43,300
Alright, who cares?

1787
02:11:43,300 --> 02:11:44,300
Whatever the hell it is.

1788
02:11:44,300 --> 02:11:45,300
You know what?

1789
02:11:45,300 --> 02:11:46,300
That was stupid.

1790
02:11:46,300 --> 02:11:47,300
Whatever.

1791
02:11:47,300 --> 02:11:49,060
Skyplines open, boys and girls.

1792
02:11:49,060 --> 02:11:50,060

1795
02:11:53,540 --> 02:11:55,700
If you're really confuzzled at everything that's going on.

1796
02:11:55,700 --> 02:11:58,420
You have cognitive dysplasia.

1797
02:11:58,420 --> 02:12:03,700
I like that, you know, those two words there.

1798
02:12:03,700 --> 02:12:11,700
And if you've ever tried to eat and snurt, if you've ever tried to eat snurt-y, if you've

1799
02:12:11,700 --> 02:12:14,780
ever tried to eat yellow snurt-y, we want to hear from you.

1800
02:12:14,780 --> 02:12:19,100
Snurt's not a fucking word, who the hell comes up with this stuff?

1801
02:12:19,100 --> 02:12:22,420
I've never heard anyone use the word snurt ever.

1802
02:12:22,420 --> 02:12:23,420
Ever.

1803
02:12:23,420 --> 02:12:24,420
Ever.

1804
02:12:24,420 --> 02:12:26,220
Alright, be quiet, we gotta call.

1805
02:12:26,220 --> 02:12:27,780
Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio.

1806
02:12:27,780 --> 02:12:30,420
Hey. Hey, what's up? Who's this?

1807
02:12:30,420 --> 02:12:33,480
BlackDevilRx. Hello, BlackDevilRx. What's on your mind?

1808
02:12:33,480 --> 02:12:38,800
Um, confuzzled should be stricken from the English language.

1809
02:12:38,800 --> 02:12:42,900
You know, I tend to agree. Confuzzled is kind of a weird word.

1810
02:12:42,900 --> 02:12:47,240
I'm trying to think of other things I see in blogs way too much that ought to be banned.

1811
02:12:47,240 --> 02:12:49,240
Like what?

1812
02:12:49,240 --> 02:12:53,720
I don't know. How about just...

1813
02:12:53,720 --> 02:12:58,280
How about over usage of exclamation points? I don't know.

1814
02:12:58,280 --> 02:12:59,920
How about leet speak?

1815
02:12:59,920 --> 02:13:05,160
I want the number three, just the number three to be panned.

1816
02:13:05,160 --> 02:13:09,760
We'll go around and break everybody's three keys so they can't type leet.

1817
02:13:09,760 --> 02:13:13,200
They can't use leet speak at all.

1818
02:13:13,200 --> 02:13:17,200
Anything on your mind gaming wise?

1819
02:13:17,200 --> 02:13:20,920
No, not much. I'm kind of waiting for you on three to come out.

1820
02:13:20,920 --> 02:13:23,000
normally out three three

1821
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:25,620
yeah yeah what do you think that they had some of the earlier

1822
02:13:25,620 --> 02:13:28,760
uh... we've gotten a lot of many had so much he's

1823
02:13:28,760 --> 02:13:29,480
good stuff

1824
02:13:29,480 --> 02:13:30,400
it's a lot

1825
02:13:30,400 --> 02:13:33,320
but it works

1826
02:13:33,320 --> 02:13:35,000
so how can you tolerate

1827
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:38,540
though the not staying on key

1828
02:13:38,540 --> 02:13:40,740
family key gravel gravel

1829
02:13:40,740 --> 02:13:41,860
uh...

1830
02:13:41,860 --> 02:13:45,900
sorry i don't know it's probably just my system i have it's really old

1831
02:13:45,900 --> 02:13:50,660
no he did she's not talking about you know she's going to happen

1832
02:13:50,660 --> 02:13:51,580
okay

1833
02:13:51,580 --> 02:13:56,300
i didn't understand that i realize dark soccer could be pretty blunt with people

1834
02:13:56,300 --> 02:14:00,420
but she does have to act

1835
02:14:00,420 --> 02:14:04,460
but but but but but but but but

1836
02:14:04,460 --> 02:14:05,740
i don't know

1837
02:14:05,740 --> 02:14:08,740
and and and and be nice she's making fun of me head

1838
02:14:08,740 --> 02:14:13,020
nice i'm not making fun of him i just don't think he can sing very well

1839
02:14:13,020 --> 02:14:17,260
He should get somebody who can sing. Well he has sold records and CD's and he makes money.

1840
02:14:17,260 --> 02:14:20,340
It's called Paula Carey but what's her excuse?

1841
02:14:20,340 --> 02:14:24,620
Go out and buy a MIDI head CD. People still buy, you know,

1842
02:14:24,620 --> 02:14:29,140
crap like Britney Spears and she can't sing either. Touché. Oh, worse than that.

1843
02:14:29,140 --> 02:14:32,300
People watch that freaking show on UPN.

1844
02:14:32,300 --> 02:14:36,080
What is it, Britney? No, no, no, wait, wait, wait, stop, stop, stop. Nobody watches UPN.

1845
02:14:36,080 --> 02:14:43,000
Ever. Wrestling's on? Uh-uh-uh. I watch Girlfriends every Monday night, okay?

1846
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:46,480
I'm just kidding I don't okay but I'm kidding I'm kidding oh my god I just

1847
02:14:46,480 --> 02:14:54,760
watched the WB oh god excuse me um weren't you a Buffy fan if I recall if I

1848
02:14:54,760 --> 02:15:02,440
like Buffy and I only watch UPN because Buffy went to UPN oh my I don't like angel I don't like

1849
02:15:02,440 --> 02:15:07,960
angel angels a whiny bitch anyway before we got there on TV chat what was that oh

1850
02:15:07,960 --> 02:15:10,960
Oh yeah, the Britney thing. Apparently on this show, what?

1851
02:15:10,960 --> 02:15:12,960
Nothing?

1852
02:15:12,960 --> 02:15:14,960
I thought we were talking about midiheads.

1853
02:15:14,960 --> 02:15:16,960
I'm just laughing at what she said.

1854
02:15:16,960 --> 02:15:18,960
How did we get the midihead to UPN?

1855
02:15:18,960 --> 02:15:20,960
Hold on, I'm not done talking about Britney Spears yet.

1856
02:15:20,960 --> 02:15:26,960
Britney Spears, apparently on her show, reveals herself to be a total nymphomaniac.

1857
02:15:26,960 --> 02:15:28,960
Like she always talks about sex.

1858
02:15:28,960 --> 02:15:30,960
That would be hard if she wasn't pregnant.

1859
02:15:32,960 --> 02:15:35,960
But since she's pregnant and fat and nasty...

1860
02:15:35,960 --> 02:15:36,960
And that would also be...

1861
02:15:36,960 --> 02:15:38,460
And she's smoking too, right?

1862
02:15:38,460 --> 02:15:39,460
She's a fucking baby killer.

1863
02:15:39,460 --> 02:15:42,840
And that would also be original if Madonna hadn't done it 15 years ago.

1864
02:15:42,840 --> 02:15:44,440
You can't have a baby genius.

1865
02:15:44,440 --> 02:15:47,920
The baby needs to grow up to be a pop star, so she has to smoke at an early age.

1866
02:15:47,920 --> 02:15:49,920
Well, her little sister's giving it a go.

1867
02:15:49,920 --> 02:15:52,740
I have a friend who went to high school with Britney Spears.

1868
02:15:52,740 --> 02:15:53,740
In New Orleans.

1869
02:15:53,740 --> 02:15:54,740
I'm sorry.

1870
02:15:54,740 --> 02:15:55,740
So was he.

1871
02:15:55,740 --> 02:15:56,740
Anyway.

1872
02:15:56,740 --> 02:16:00,280
Hi, Black Devil or X, you called to talk about games?

1873
02:16:00,280 --> 02:16:01,280
Still here.

1874
02:16:01,280 --> 02:16:05,280
This is what we do to our callers, don't worry about it.

1875
02:16:09,280 --> 02:16:13,280
Yeah, so hopefully no Britney on Ultramix 3, although

1876
02:16:13,280 --> 02:16:17,280
the Extreme 2 kids are getting some Britney, but it's gonna be covered.

1877
02:16:17,280 --> 02:16:21,280
Huh? People got angry. Oh my god!

1878
02:16:21,280 --> 02:16:25,280
Oops, I did it again! Oh no!

1879
02:16:25,280 --> 02:16:29,280
You know, I think somebody in that thread actually put it best when they said, well if you think about it

1880
02:16:29,280 --> 02:16:33,840
I did it again is so old now like it's getting to be like you know five over

1881
02:16:33,840 --> 02:16:37,560
five years old the song if you can believe it the song is so old now it's

1882
02:16:37,560 --> 02:16:42,660
getting into that stage where it's funny to make fun of it again you know it's

1883
02:16:42,660 --> 02:16:47,400
funny to bring it back for nostalgia value kind of like like vanilla ice is

1884
02:16:47,400 --> 02:16:54,000
right now as well yeah reality show there you go under pressure yeah the

1885
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:59,000
Vanilla Ice got to, you know, bow Madonna in her sex book.

1886
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:02,000
Okay, thank you, randomness!

1887
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:06,000
That is a good point. He has scored some cool points from that.

1888
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:08,000
And Ninja Rap.

1889
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:10,000
Yeah, Ninja Rap. That's up there.

1890
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:12,000
It's up there in the big pile of suck!

1891
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:14,000
Go Ninja! Go Ninja! Go!

1892
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:18,000
Oh, and you know what rhymes with Go Ninja! Go Ninja! Go!

1893
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:21,000
Konami! Konami! Yo!

1894
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:23,000
I know that's what I was thinking.

1895
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:25,000
I swear to God at E3, the announcer guy would be,

1896
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:27,000
KONAMI, KONAMI, YO!

1897
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:29,000
And then they got all of us going,

1898
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:31,000
I was just moving my mouth going,

1899
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:33,000
this sucks, this sucks, yo.

1900
02:17:33,000 --> 02:17:36,000
And I was thinking, go ninja, go ninja, go!

1901
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:38,000
I just said, ninja, ninja rap.

1902
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:48,000
Thank you for depressing us, BlackDevilRx, with your phone call.

1903
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:50,000
You're welcome. You are so welcome.

1904
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:53,000
We like us from the distraction here.

1905
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:55,000
You're getting us in the mood for the goth club.

1906
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:57,000
Digression is our middle name.

1907
02:17:57,000 --> 02:18:00,000
No, lounge is our middle name.

1908
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:05,000
I'm going to wear all black and I'm going to listen to depressing music.

1909
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:10,000
I'm a real abyss prince and a sorrow.

1910
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:14,000
Okay, the joke is about an hour and a half ago.

1911
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:16,000
Goth talk still cracks me up.

1912
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:18,000
I'm on joke Hawaiian time.

1913
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:20,000
Our caller's trying to speak, let's speak.

1914
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:22,000
No, no, no, I'm just...

1915
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:23,000
I'm finished.

1916
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:25,000
You don't want to speak?

1917
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:27,000
Well, you could sing or something, I don't know.

1918
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:29,000
Thanks.

1919
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:30,000
Serenade us!

1920
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:31,000
I command.

1921
02:18:31,000 --> 02:18:33,000
Making fun of goth people.

1922
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:35,000
I can't hear him.

1923
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:36,000
He's saying keep making fun of goth people.

1924
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:37,000
Yeah, you're getting quiet all of a sudden.

1925
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:39,000
We're not making fun of goth people.

1926
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:41,000
We're making fun of people who make fun of goth people.

1927
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:43,000
Like you.

1928
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:46,000

02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:35,000
Later. Bye.

1945
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:42,000
I bet it's gotta be really amusing to be somebody calling into this show and just really not knowing what you're in for when you come and speak to us.

1946
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:48,000
Let's get another call.

1947
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:51,000
This is like one of those times that we need a random call from like Travis.

1948
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:52,000
Hold on, hold on.

1949
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:53,000
Travis, call us!

1950
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:56,000

Go Siggy, go Siggy, go!

1954
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:04,000
Oh, will you stop that?

1955
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:08,000
We don't have to.

1956
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:12,000
I'm getting sick and tired hearing that ninja rap already.

1957
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:14,000
Come here and make us!

1958
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:16,000
Damn!

1959
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:21,000
Oh, what a good start. I like it when the callers berate us once in a while.

1960
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:25,000
Yeah, but they better be ready to receive as good as they give.

1961
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:27,000
Uh-huh.

1962
02:20:27,000 --> 02:20:29,000
Alright. Siggy, what's on your mind?

1963
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:33,000
Well, uh, bimani-wise, uh, I finally, uh, on 2DX, I finally...

1964
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:35,000
Who cares if it's bimani?

1965
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:36,000
Sorry.

1966
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:41,000
I finally triple-a'd the most common another, which is, uh, Komonta the Adieu.

1967
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:43,000
Ah, okay, good.

1968
02:20:43,000 --> 02:20:49,000
Yeah, and, uh, I've beaten some, yeah, I've beaten some, uh, anothers as well, like Stoic and, uh, Murmur Twins.

1969
02:20:49,000 --> 02:20:51,000
Now, Stoic is some scary shit on another.

1970
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:54,000
Oh, you're telling me.

1971
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:59,680

02:21:01,720 --> 02:21:03,040
Thank you.

2050
02:24:30,180 --> 02:24:34,180
I don't know. Somebody had posted this over on The Freak, so now I'm all curious.

2051
02:24:34,180 --> 02:24:37,180
because i think this is a clip of the genie in a bottle mix that's on d r

2052
02:24:37,180 --> 02:24:38,000
extreme

2053
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:40,200
and if not it'll be movie time

02:24:42,380 --> 02:24:43,780

02:25:02,760 --> 02:25:06,640

02:25:06,640 --> 02:25:08,200
you both should i broke it

2064
02:25:08,200 --> 02:25:14,360

02:25:20,100 --> 02:25:24,340

joel the fan cam does the d r

2069
02:25:30,940 --> 02:25:37,940
I can't hear this for shit.

2070
02:25:39,500 --> 02:25:42,540
No. No, I'm turning this off, because you can't hear it for crap.

2071
02:25:42,540 --> 02:25:46,380
If you want to check this out, though, it's on E3Insider.com. Just do a

2072
02:25:46,380 --> 02:25:49,780
search for DDR, and if you, like, turn up your speakers really, really loud, you can

2073
02:25:49,780 --> 02:25:52,360
hear it. You can hear what the new Genium bottle and DDR sounds like.

2074
02:25:52,360 --> 02:25:55,020
And, supposedly, it's actually surprisingly good.

2075
02:25:55,020 --> 02:25:59,080
Honestly, folks, if you want to know what Genium bottle sounds like, just imagine

2076
02:25:59,080 --> 02:26:02,720
a dance media cover. That's what it is, basically.

2077
02:26:02,720 --> 02:26:04,560
Pretty much.

2078
02:26:04,560 --> 02:26:05,960
All right.

2079
02:26:05,960 --> 02:26:07,260
Um...

2080
02:26:07,260 --> 02:26:11,400
We're going to get into the FUs of the Week very shortly here. I don't see anybody else

2081
02:26:11,400 --> 02:26:18,360
calling in, so we will do Loki's song, and then we're going to do the FUs of the Week. So start sending in the FUs of the Week right now.

2082
02:26:18,360 --> 02:26:19,480
And, um...

2083
02:26:19,480 --> 02:26:20,960
We'll get to that.

2084
02:26:20,960 --> 02:26:25,200
But, Loki, what are we playing here from you? Well, this is right here, like I said before.

2085
02:26:25,200 --> 02:26:26,720
It's not a...

2086
02:26:26,720 --> 02:26:31,840
really a remix. It's just kind of, I extended the song a bit and I added some samples on

2087
02:26:31,840 --> 02:26:36,920
top of it. I thought about remixing it, but then I figured out that the song, the portions

2088
02:26:36,920 --> 02:26:41,280
I have of the song, because it's only a minute long really, the original, I didn't have enough

2089
02:26:41,280 --> 02:26:46,560
to work with to make something. So, this is whatever crap it is. And I don't know what

2090
02:26:46,560 --> 02:26:50,840
the actual title of the song is, so I called it Acid. It's basically the theme that they

2091
02:26:50,840 --> 02:26:54,360
had playing in the trailer for Metal Gear Acid 2, and it was fucking awesome. Every

2092
02:26:54,360 --> 02:26:57,840
Every time I heard this song at the Kanae booth I'm like, I gotta get this song, I gotta

2093
02:26:57,840 --> 02:26:59,640
get this song, I gotta get this song.

2094
02:26:59,640 --> 02:27:06,640
So, I found it. I sort of extended it. It's pretty cool. Enjoy.

2095
02:27:59,640 --> 02:28:06,560
with the

2096
02:28:06,560 --> 02:28:16,120
me

2097
02:28:16,120 --> 02:28:23,200
the

2098
02:28:23,200 --> 02:28:51,080
That was wonderful.

2099
02:28:51,080 --> 02:28:55,800
back on orange launch radio by the way loki so anything else you want to say about that mix no

2100
02:28:55,800 --> 02:29:00,200
not really it's just awesome i just needed to make a version of it that could play in my car that's

2101
02:29:00,200 --> 02:29:06,200
about it who knows i might work on that later maybe to add something i am however going to work

2102
02:29:06,200 --> 02:29:10,440
on something because there's another song that i liked in another trailer and i found the trailer

2103
02:29:10,440 --> 02:29:16,680
today for coated arms that's going to be a remix of trip machine eventually but um this is just

2104
02:29:16,680 --> 02:29:24,400
something for now it's just fun just because I like that song all right we're

2105
02:29:24,400 --> 02:29:28,440
now going to get into a segment we do every single week here at the orange

2108
02:29:37,280 --> 02:29:44,280
Grr, argh.

2109
02:29:44,640 --> 02:29:49,440
Well, yep, I picked different music again this week because I just cannot decide.

2110
02:29:49,440 --> 02:29:53,120
Big SU goes to bloating.

2111
02:29:53,120 --> 02:29:59,280
I'm not going to say anything more about that. Um, an SU goes to my car being completely

2112
02:29:59,280 --> 02:30:04,160
un-driveable now. My fiancee, bless him, tried to hammer the fender back into place.

2113
02:30:04,160 --> 02:30:09,160
Well, I can drive it if I want to go left all the time.

2114
02:30:09,160 --> 02:30:12,160
Yeah, it's undriveable. Unsafe.

2115
02:30:12,160 --> 02:30:14,160
Sigh.

2116
02:30:14,160 --> 02:30:18,160
Um, also, um, you know, she was a nice lady.

2117
02:30:18,160 --> 02:30:21,160
Has always done a great job doing my haircut.

2118
02:30:21,160 --> 02:30:24,160
But, my hair got cut way too short.

2119
02:30:24,160 --> 02:30:28,160
And then, uh, you know, my scalp is still red from dyeing it.

2120
02:30:28,160 --> 02:30:31,160
So, big F you to that, too.

2121
02:30:31,160 --> 02:30:47,160
Um, F you to my nerves, and F you to me putting off stuff that needs to get done, and that's really, oh yeah, and a big ol' F you to my work for changing all of my damn job duties, while I was at E3! Yeah, big fuck off to that. Okay, I'm done.

2122
02:30:47,160 --> 02:31:07,160
First off, fuck you to everybody that's not on Final Fantasy XI because, you know, it's very quiet when I come online to play, you know, late at night and there's just me. I can't really talk to myself. It's not fun. And everyone else is Japanese and that doesn't work. So that sucks.

2123
02:31:07,160 --> 02:31:10,160
And everyone else is Japanese and that doesn't work.

2124
02:31:10,160 --> 02:31:12,160
So that sucks.

2125
02:31:12,160 --> 02:31:13,160
You'll get over it.

2126
02:31:13,160 --> 02:31:15,160
Or you'll quit too.

2127
02:31:15,160 --> 02:31:19,160
I'm not quitting. I have dedicated too much time to my character.

2128
02:31:19,160 --> 02:31:22,160
I will stay on until that game stops working.

2129
02:31:22,160 --> 02:31:26,160
Or I become level 75 in every single job and have finished every single bit of that game.

2130
02:31:26,160 --> 02:31:29,160
And then I'll sell my character.

2131
02:31:29,160 --> 02:31:31,160
And make some mad cash.

2132
02:31:31,160 --> 02:31:41,160
Um, then, uh, also, just, basically, you know, fuck you to Robot Chicken for sucking the last few weeks, and fuck you to the fact that I missed Family Guy tonight.

2133
02:31:41,160 --> 02:31:49,160
Oh, it's not on? Oh well. Never mind then! Family Guy is not on tonight, so listen to Arnold Schwarzenegger's radio.

2134
02:31:49,160 --> 02:31:51,160
Anyway.

2135
02:31:51,160 --> 02:31:54,160
And if you heard that, you already are listening to Arnold Schwarzenegger's radio.

2136
02:31:54,160 --> 02:32:06,160
Also, um, fuck you to Arnold Schwarzenegger, because he can act. And, um, he can't really govern either, so I don't really know what his talent is yet. He can lift weights! He should be a weightlifter. The end.

2137
02:32:06,160 --> 02:32:19,160
Um, and also, um, fuck you to everyone that's saying that this new commercial with, um, Paris Hilton is too scantily clad. Honestly, whatever. It's just blatant, you know, sex sells, you know, burger commercial.

2138
02:32:19,160 --> 02:32:21,040
I don't see anything wrong with that, to be honest.

2139
02:32:21,040 --> 02:32:23,400
Hell, if she's gonna be a whore, let her be a whore on TV.

2140
02:32:23,400 --> 02:32:26,800
At least she's, you know, scandal-clad and stuff and showing off her body.

2141
02:32:26,800 --> 02:32:29,040
Big deal, you know, honestly, cause that's what she...

2142
02:32:29,040 --> 02:32:32,440
That's her only talent, so just let her, you know...

2143
02:32:32,440 --> 02:32:34,360
Let her work her talent.

2144
02:32:34,360 --> 02:32:38,640
You know, eventually she's gonna do mainstream porn and that'll be, uh, happy.

2145
02:32:38,640 --> 02:32:40,280
And, um...

2146
02:32:40,280 --> 02:32:44,800
Finally, um, I'd like to mention, um, a fuck you to...

2147
02:32:44,800 --> 02:32:48,000
Uh, Patrick Swayze for being just all weird.

2148
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:51,400
because he's coming to our work next week and signing autographs

2149
02:32:51,400 --> 02:32:54,040
so I'm actually going to get an autograph of his for some reason

2150
02:32:54,040 --> 02:32:59,200
and um... but he doesn't want anyone to sign anything that has to do with

2151
02:32:59,200 --> 02:33:00,960
older projects he's worked

2152
02:33:00,960 --> 02:33:03,160
worked on i.e. like you know

2153
02:33:03,160 --> 02:33:04,080
um...

2154
02:33:04,080 --> 02:33:08,240
dirty dancing or something like that and he doesn't want you to touch him in any way

2155
02:33:08,240 --> 02:33:11,440
aww so you can't give Patrick Swayze a hug

2156
02:33:11,440 --> 02:33:13,720
or shake his hand or anything he's like AHHH

2157
02:33:13,720 --> 02:33:15,440
you know it's like

2158
02:33:15,440 --> 02:33:18,440
Yeah, Patrick Swayze has come into my work. That's awesome.

2159
02:33:18,440 --> 02:33:21,440
But, you know, I just don't really care either. I'm hoping...

2160
02:33:21,440 --> 02:33:24,440
The best person that came to our work, actually, the two best people,

2161
02:33:24,440 --> 02:33:27,440
Pauly Shore and, um...

2162
02:33:27,440 --> 02:33:31,440
Oh, God, uh, Rob Schneider. My favorites.

2163
02:33:31,440 --> 02:33:33,440
Alright, I'm done. I don't really have anything.

2164
02:33:33,440 --> 02:33:44,660
an F you to me feeling selfish because I'm not getting what I want and that

2165
02:33:44,660 --> 02:33:51,260
makes me very sad and just F you to general blondness I've kind of been

2166
02:33:51,260 --> 02:33:56,420
dealing with the past few days and F you to feeling an utter lack of something

2167
02:33:56,420 --> 02:34:01,420
kostjamrh Yeah, I guess that's it. Was that cryptic enough? I don't know. Alright, let's move on. Bradley.

2168
02:34:26,420 --> 02:34:30,100
a skeleton computer or something new.

2169
02:34:30,100 --> 02:34:32,100
I'm hopefully going to do that soon.

2170
02:34:32,100 --> 02:34:35,820
That's about all.

2171
02:34:35,820 --> 02:34:37,980
Alright, let's go on to the chat room FUs.

2172
02:34:37,980 --> 02:34:43,140
Dynamite rage!

2173

Chimaera

2174
02:34:44,300 --> 02:34:47,380
wants to give an FU to Goths.

2175
02:34:47,380 --> 02:34:50,900
Just remember, if you make fun of Goths, you still play DDR.

2176
02:34:50,900 --> 02:34:52,980
That would be Chimaera.

2177
02:34:52,980 --> 02:34:56,740

2210
02:37:31,320 --> 02:37:32,320
I love you.

2211
02:37:32,320 --> 02:37:33,320
No, no, no, no, no.

2212
02:37:33,320 --> 02:37:35,320
They should have censored it and said, fucking Janet.

2213
02:37:35,320 --> 02:37:36,320
Oh well.

2214
02:37:36,320 --> 02:37:37,320
Fuck off, bitch.

2215
02:37:37,320 --> 02:37:41,320
Oh well, we still get to do Rock Your Picture Show music, and that's the last one.

2216
02:37:41,320 --> 02:37:42,320
That's good.

2217
02:37:42,320 --> 02:37:43,320
All right.

2218
02:37:43,320 --> 02:37:48,840
Yeah, I agree that what you should do, Illusion, is your very last night at karaoke at that

2219
02:37:48,840 --> 02:37:49,840
place.

2220
02:37:49,840 --> 02:37:52,800
First off, stop going to a family friendly establishment for karaoke, but I understand

2221
02:37:52,800 --> 02:37:55,840
you're probably not old enough to get into a bar yet, so you can keep doing that for

2222
02:37:55,840 --> 02:37:56,840
now.

2223
02:37:56,840 --> 02:37:59,520
But then when you're old enough to get to a bar, do your last hurrah at karaoke, and

2224
02:37:59,520 --> 02:38:04,400
you've got the mic in your hand on the very last Dammit Janet go fuck off bitch

2225
02:38:04,400 --> 02:38:10,640
I want to screw and then just walk out before they throw you out run what are

2226
02:38:10,640 --> 02:38:14,680
they gonna do turn the mics off on you Oh No's

2227
02:38:16,160 --> 02:38:24,340
my ears are bleeding I heard body hurts and I'm going to go to hell for it I want to have sex with

2228
02:38:24,340 --> 02:38:31,340
It's the prostitutes now, Mommy!

2229
02:38:32,020 --> 02:38:33,900
Because I saw it on TV.

2230
02:38:33,900 --> 02:38:37,260
That's the nice thing about karaoke, where I go to karaoke, is that you can replace

2231
02:38:37,260 --> 02:38:38,460
the lyrics with

2232
02:38:38,460 --> 02:38:42,860
fuck off, bitch, I want to screw, and then they laugh.

2233
02:38:42,860 --> 02:38:47,160
I was remembering the toucha toucha one. That was funny.

2234
02:38:47,160 --> 02:38:50,860
Oh, fucka fucka fuck me? No, you went up there and confused me.

2235
02:38:50,860 --> 02:38:58,860
Oh yeah, who was singing it, Jessica? Jessica was. Yeah, Jessica, uh, Iguana Girl was up on stage singing Touch a Touch a Touch Me, so I walked up on stage and grabbed her boobs.

2236
02:38:58,860 --> 02:39:04,860
That cracked me up.

2237
02:39:04,860 --> 02:39:12,860
Anyways, oh yeah. Did we mention that we sometimes use foul language on this show?

2238
02:39:12,860 --> 02:39:15,860
This is your program, it's not any language.

2239
02:39:15,860 --> 02:39:21,860
We gave the disclaimer. If people are offended by it, you heard the disclaimer.

2240
02:39:21,860 --> 02:39:24,860
Fuck off. Yeah.

2241
02:39:24,860 --> 02:39:28,860
Alright. We're going to do another quickie break here.

2242
02:39:28,860 --> 02:39:30,860
I love internet radio!

2243
02:39:30,860 --> 02:39:34,860
Just an uber quick break here, and then we're going to come back with Ask Orange Lounge.

2244
02:39:34,860 --> 02:39:38,860
So you guys have a few minutes to get in your questions for Ask Orange Lounge.

2245
02:39:38,860 --> 02:39:41,860
You can ask us anything you want, within reason.

2246
02:39:41,860 --> 02:39:46,460
and send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your question. It's your chance

2247
02:39:46,460 --> 02:39:47,820
to direct the show

2248
02:39:47,820 --> 02:39:52,020
the way you want. We'll be back after this featuring some music from

2249
02:39:52,020 --> 02:39:55,060

2263

Come on now, get up and dance, dance in your pants

2264
02:41:07,060 --> 02:41:09,060
Can't be someone you don't feel

2265
02:41:09,060 --> 02:41:11,060
Ready to be who the monster's gonna be

02:41:13,060 --> 02:41:16,060
Get up, stand up, touch up, touch up, jump up

02:41:16,060 --> 02:41:20,060
Get up, stand up, touch up, touch up, jump up

02:41:20,060 --> 02:41:21,780
Get up, stand up.

Love and peace is our fight

All for one, come together friends We have to take the chance

2350
02:44:12,980 --> 02:44:27,460
Come together friends, we gotta take big steps tonight.

2351
02:44:27,460 --> 02:44:33,660
And now, let's listen in to an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting as they debate some of

2352
02:44:33,660 --> 02:44:37,020
the new programming coming to Orange Lounge Radio.

2353
02:44:37,020 --> 02:44:41,660
Um, Jamie, I have a suggestion about some of the music in our Bamani Music & More program.

2354
02:44:41,660 --> 02:44:42,900
Can we talk about that?

2355
02:44:42,900 --> 02:44:47,460
subject will ever be taboo. Well I was thinking maybe we should move pump up

2356
02:44:47,460 --> 02:44:51,600
the volume from Tuesday nights. Except of course the subject that was just on our

2357
02:44:51,600 --> 02:44:56,340
discussion. Okay well what would you think if maybe we cut back on some of

2358
02:44:56,340 --> 02:45:02,480
the tack music we play on the station? I collect your fucking head. Just like this

2359
02:45:02,480 --> 02:45:07,400
fucker here. Oh my god why did you do that to

2360
02:45:07,400 --> 02:45:12,400
Loki, the holic thing on episode 69 was just a joke!

2361
02:45:12,400 --> 02:45:19,400
Now if any of you sons of bitches got anything else to say, now's the fucking time!

2362
02:45:19,400 --> 02:45:24,400
Orange Lounge Radio, where everybody has a say.

2363
02:45:29,400 --> 02:45:31,400
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

2364
02:45:31,400 --> 02:45:35,400
Loki's saying nobody gets the episode 69 thing anymore. You're probably right.

2365
02:45:35,400 --> 02:45:40,760
I wasn't even here for episode 69.

2366
02:45:40,760 --> 02:45:44,360
Which in a way kind of makes it funnier when you consider all the holic thing, you know,

2367
02:45:44,360 --> 02:45:45,360
but anyway.

2368
02:45:45,360 --> 02:45:49,440
Let's get, we actually have quite a few questions tonight for Ask Orange Lounge.

2369
02:45:49,440 --> 02:45:53,160
Usually I'm having to beg and plead for questions, but people just want to know shit tonight,

2370
02:45:53,160 --> 02:45:54,680
so this is good.

2371
02:45:54,680 --> 02:46:01,800
Let's get to it.

2372
02:46:01,800 --> 02:46:03,520
Let's Ask Orange Lounge.

2373
02:46:03,520 --> 02:46:09,580
stupid question what will we find out this week on r's not r's radio we've got a lot

2374
02:46:09,580 --> 02:46:14,340
of questions and only ten minutes left of show so we better hurry through these questions

2375
02:46:14,340 --> 02:46:25,340
or some are getting left in the dust illusion wants to know question for loki you

2376
02:46:25,340 --> 02:46:31,660
often do remixes of babani songs but do you do any original songs if you do would you

2377
02:46:31,660 --> 02:46:38,660
ever released a CD? Um, I do original songs, but it's been a long time. We've played some

2378
02:46:39,080 --> 02:46:43,560
of them on this station before. A long time ago when you did original stuff. Why'd you

2379
02:46:43,560 --> 02:46:50,020
stop? It's just, I was using old programs like EJ and stuff. Lazy. No, not lazy, it's

2380
02:46:50,020 --> 02:46:53,600
just the sound samples I didn't really want to work with, and I tried to upgrade programs

2381
02:46:53,600 --> 02:46:58,600
and stuff to something that would be more fun to work with. I don't know, I don't know.

2382
02:46:58,600 --> 02:46:59,600
We'll see.

2383
02:46:59,600 --> 02:47:00,600
Maybe.

2384
02:47:00,600 --> 02:47:06,680
Well, now, you did put together a compilation CD, but it was only, like, you only did, like,

2385
02:47:06,680 --> 02:47:08,600
two or three copies of the CD, right?

2386
02:47:08,600 --> 02:47:10,760
Well, yeah, because I have all the files.

2387
02:47:10,760 --> 02:47:14,600
Originally, it was going to be one of those create-your-own-CD-type situations on, like,

2388
02:47:14,600 --> 02:47:15,600
a website.

2389
02:47:15,600 --> 02:47:19,480
Of course, web hosting, you know, it's not too reliable, so, meh.

2390
02:47:19,480 --> 02:47:21,480
Yeah, I hate that.

2391
02:47:21,480 --> 02:47:24,280
I just can't find any websites with, like, unlimited bandwidth or anything.

2392
02:47:24,280 --> 02:47:25,560
All right, let's move on.

2393
02:47:25,560 --> 02:47:30,320
Jin4576 says Namco Cross Capcom came out in Japan recently.

2394
02:47:30,320 --> 02:47:32,540
Do you think that it will come out here in the U.S.?

2395
02:47:32,540 --> 02:47:33,380
Of course.

2396
02:47:33,380 --> 02:47:34,220
My answer is yes.

2397
02:47:34,220 --> 02:47:35,260
Yes, it definitely will come out here.

2398
02:47:35,260 --> 02:47:37,060
In fact, I think it's already been announced.

2399
02:47:37,060 --> 02:47:39,600
They just didn't show it at E3 for whatever reason.

2400
02:47:39,600 --> 02:47:42,280
So I expect you'll probably see it at what, Christmas time?

2401
02:47:42,280 --> 02:47:43,120
What do you think?

2402
02:47:43,120 --> 02:47:43,940
Probably.

2403
02:47:43,940 --> 02:47:44,780
Does that sound good?

2404
02:47:44,780 --> 02:47:46,360
Yeah, I like that idea.

2405
02:47:46,360 --> 02:47:47,860
It'll come out here.

2406
02:47:47,860 --> 02:47:50,320
I think that's too big a game to not come out here.

2407
02:47:51,320 --> 02:47:53,960
Laser123454321 wants to know,

2408
02:47:53,960 --> 02:47:57,960
What would be a good licensed song for Beatmania USA?

2409
02:48:23,960 --> 02:48:28,540
what they could do that would actually work pretty well. Just do some Guitar Freaks crossovers

2410
02:48:28,540 --> 02:48:33,380
or something like that. I mean, they've already got the files. I mean, like, the actual samples

2411
02:48:33,380 --> 02:48:34,380
and stuff.

2412
02:48:34,380 --> 02:48:37,980
How about just take some of the different drum stuff? Echo Image, Midi Head, Hello.

2413
02:48:37,980 --> 02:48:42,520
Exactly. Oh, my God. Midi Head stuff. I mean, that's, I think, where they should go. And

2414
02:48:42,520 --> 02:48:47,880
Toe Jam. I bet Toe Jam's going to be in there. Just because it's, you know, a different drum

2415
02:48:47,880 --> 02:48:51,120
song and it was in, you know, the 2DX.

2416
02:48:51,120 --> 02:48:56,780
A big idea is a different drum, but I know I know what you're saying. It was the u.s. Song and now it's in happy sky

2417
02:48:56,780 --> 02:48:58,460
Yeah, yeah, who knows?

2418
02:48:58,460 --> 02:49:05,840
We need I up personally ill I I really want echo image skulk or at least some echo image song

2419
02:49:06,000 --> 02:49:07,440
That'd be cool

2420
02:49:07,440 --> 02:49:11,020
Chimera since I got criticized for my pronunciation wants to know

2421
02:49:11,560 --> 02:49:17,000
Yo, do you think it would be ethical to cheat friends of their souls like in a game of high-stakes poker?

2422
02:49:17,000 --> 02:49:21,000
Absolutely not. If they're stupid enough to bet it, then they're stupid enough to lose it.

2423
02:49:21,000 --> 02:49:23,000
Like, if you're going to sell your soul for a donut, I mean...

2424
02:49:23,000 --> 02:49:25,000
Or sell your soul for $5?

2425
02:49:25,000 --> 02:49:26,000
Or sell it on eBay?

2426
02:49:26,000 --> 02:49:27,000
It'll be a fucking good donut.

2427
02:49:27,000 --> 02:49:33,000
Well, technically, your soul's not free to sell, actually, because it's, you know, it's just energy field around you.

2428
02:49:33,000 --> 02:49:39,000
So it's really impossible to sell that, because I don't think you know a way to transfer it away from you in the first place.

2429
02:49:41,000 --> 02:49:44,000
Also, shouldn't Maddox get his own forums?

2430
02:49:44,000 --> 02:49:49,080
No. I wasn't aware he didn't have them. But you know what, he doesn't need them.

2431
02:49:49,080 --> 02:49:53,760
Maddox, he doesn't care about people's input and stuff, and he would just annoy the hell out of them.

2432
02:49:53,760 --> 02:49:58,600
Honestly, he has a book coming out, okay? He has a book deal coming out, so just

2433
02:49:58,600 --> 02:50:01,880
read the book. Honestly, I read his site all the time

2434
02:50:01,880 --> 02:50:05,480
just because it's funny, and I agree with his point of view. Like, for example,

2435
02:50:05,480 --> 02:50:09,480
his latest one, I Hate Cameron Diaz. I hate Cameron Diaz, too.

2436
02:50:09,480 --> 02:50:12,960
It's because of that stupid MTV show that she does now.

2437
02:50:12,960 --> 02:50:20,400
And if you show yeah, she goes to all the parts of the world that are that are poor like

2438
02:50:20,400 --> 02:50:23,840
You know Africa and the Amazon and blah blah blah

2439
02:50:23,880 --> 02:50:31,280
He doesn't need forums because people talk about him on other forums. Look we're talking about him now. This is free publicity

2440
02:50:31,280 --> 02:50:33,280
He didn't pay for

2441
02:50:33,280 --> 02:50:37,880
He didn't need forms. It would just be annoying. Trust me. He wouldn't do it. I

2442
02:50:38,440 --> 02:50:40,840
Wouldn't want him. Yeah, I wouldn't do it

2443
02:50:40,840 --> 02:50:45,680
Chubbs wants to know, what is the circumference of your left wrist?

2444
02:50:45,680 --> 02:50:49,020
Well, that's a good question. I don't have one of those bendy rulers, though, like a

2445
02:50:49,020 --> 02:50:51,800
fabric ruler that you would use to measure fabric that can, like, bend around. I don't

2446
02:50:51,800 --> 02:50:56,760
have one of those, so I can't really measure it. I know this is radio, but it's about that

2447
02:50:56,760 --> 02:50:57,760
big.

2448
02:50:57,760 --> 02:51:02,680
Well, let's see here. Okay. Now, everyone knows that, you know, if you point your finger

2449
02:51:02,680 --> 02:51:06,040
like a gun, that is how big your penis is, supposedly, okay?

2450
02:51:06,040 --> 02:51:07,040
What?

2451
02:51:07,040 --> 02:51:08,040
So if that's...

2452
02:51:08,040 --> 02:51:09,040
What?

2453
02:51:09,040 --> 02:51:10,040
Supposedly.

2454
02:51:10,040 --> 02:51:15,520
Hold on, hold on, I'm looking at something here, oh never mind.

2455
02:51:15,520 --> 02:51:22,080
So I would say roughly the circumference, well I need to go in the bathroom for a minute.

2456
02:51:22,080 --> 02:51:24,600
I would say mine's about 7 inches around.

2457
02:51:24,600 --> 02:51:26,480
Yeah, I'd say about that too.

2458
02:51:26,480 --> 02:51:27,480
My wrist.

2459
02:51:27,480 --> 02:51:28,480
Let's see, if it's...

2460
02:51:28,480 --> 02:51:29,480
Who cares?

2461
02:51:29,480 --> 02:51:32,800
My thumb is just touching my index finger, so...

2462
02:51:32,800 --> 02:51:37,680
You're supposed to use your, from your index finger from your knuckle, between your knuckles

2463
02:51:37,680 --> 02:51:40,680
I'd say 12 inches.

2464
02:51:40,680 --> 02:51:41,680
Forget it.

2465
02:51:41,680 --> 02:51:42,680
12 inches length.

2466
02:51:42,680 --> 02:51:43,680
You're right.

2467
02:51:43,680 --> 02:51:44,680
Did I say, can you lick your elbow?

2468
02:51:44,680 --> 02:51:45,680
Forget it.

2469
02:51:45,680 --> 02:51:46,680
Um.

2470
02:51:46,680 --> 02:51:47,680
Ahh.

2471
02:51:47,680 --> 02:51:57,680
Dark Knight wants to know, oh Sky, I finally got an MP3 player that can handle multiple

2472
02:51:57,680 --> 02:52:00,360
episodes of Orange Lounge Radio 2 Go now.

2473
02:52:00,360 --> 02:52:05,840
So the only thing I worry about now is losing it because it's a small-ass MP3 player.

2474
02:52:05,840 --> 02:52:09,280
put it on a string and wear it around your neck. That's the only way I don't lose things

2475
02:52:09,280 --> 02:52:13,660
is to wear it around my neck. That's what I have to do with my work badge. If I did

2476
02:52:13,660 --> 02:52:18,720
not wear my work badge around my damn neck, I would lose it. I don't care if I look stupid

2477
02:52:18,720 --> 02:52:21,940
wearing my work badge around my neck or I look like a girl or something. I've never

2478
02:52:21,940 --> 02:52:25,400
lost a damn thing and I've never had to pay the $10 replacement fee. So there you have

2479
02:52:25,400 --> 02:52:31,420
it. If you don't want to lose it, wear it around your neck. Agree? Disagree? No comment?

2480
02:52:31,420 --> 02:52:36,980
Put a giant freaking chain on it. Duct tape. Duct tape. Duct tape it to your forehead.

2481
02:52:36,980 --> 02:52:41,020
You will never lose it again. Also, when you pull the duct tape off, you'll have big red

2482
02:52:41,020 --> 02:52:46,780
welts. Go welts. Whoops, that actually wasn't supposed to be a question on air. That was

2483
02:52:46,780 --> 02:52:52,460
a question to me. That was a private question to me. For those of you that like to have

2484
02:52:52,460 --> 02:52:56,220
private conversations with a host during the show, that's fine and good. But just keep

2485
02:52:56,220 --> 02:53:00,300
in mind, if we're in the middle of a segment where I'm soliciting private messages, you

2486
02:53:00,300 --> 02:53:05,220
might get caught in the middle. Just a warning. It's a good thing he didn't send something

2487
02:53:05,220 --> 02:53:12,580
that says like, oh man, I just, I just cheated on somebody or I don't know whatever it is.

2488
02:53:12,580 --> 02:53:15,900
I go and read that on here. Yeah, we read that one time. Oh my god, I secretly read

2489
02:53:15,900 --> 02:53:19,700
Brittany's first part. Hey, remember that one time that Ryan's girlfriend called in

2490
02:53:19,700 --> 02:53:25,900
for Ryan and Ryan wasn't here and just, you know. Oh, I just shot myself in the foot.

2491
02:53:25,900 --> 02:53:34,200
Omgitsdoobs wants to know, why do all goths think they are vampires?

2492
02:53:34,200 --> 02:53:35,200
That is bullshit!

2493
02:53:35,200 --> 02:53:39,360
Some of them think they are succubuses.

2494
02:53:39,360 --> 02:53:47,920
I have never once thought I was a vampire, or a succubus.

2495
02:53:47,920 --> 02:53:51,080
Some of them think they're freeeeeee!

2496
02:53:51,080 --> 02:53:55,040
Okay, you need to drop that, because that is old joke, okay?

2497
02:53:55,040 --> 02:53:59,040
And Ross gets together and say on the very server!

2498
02:53:59,040 --> 02:54:00,880
Oh, why is that so funny? I don't know!

2499
02:54:00,880 --> 02:54:04,480
Oh, because she's a fat cow! That's why!

2500
02:54:04,480 --> 02:54:09,760
Of course, for those that don't remember, this is dating back to the old livejournal community.

2501
02:54:09,760 --> 02:54:10,520
You know what?

2502
02:54:10,520 --> 02:54:11,420
On livejournal.

2503
02:54:11,420 --> 02:54:16,260
This is just more of a case of people making fun of what they don't understand.

2504
02:54:16,260 --> 02:54:19,140
I learned that she can become a fat cow like that.

2505
02:54:19,140 --> 02:54:23,380
I'm not talking about the stupid bitch she deserved because she really was an idiot.

2506
02:54:23,380 --> 02:54:27,480
But I'm referring to this whole, oh let's make fun of everybody who's

2507
02:54:27,480 --> 02:54:28,600
goth or whatever.

2508
02:54:28,600 --> 02:54:29,940
You know what?

2509
02:54:29,940 --> 02:54:33,660
Don't poke fun at what you don't understand because it just makes you look like a big weirdo.

2510
02:54:33,660 --> 02:54:36,160
Why do all DDR players think they're Asian?

2511
02:54:36,160 --> 02:54:38,580
I can ask the same thing.

2512
02:54:38,580 --> 02:54:41,300
See? And they don't. Unless they happen to...

2513
02:54:41,300 --> 02:54:46,500
but i honestly am i'm defending the goth here okay suicide girls dot com is

2514
02:54:46,500 --> 02:54:48,100

2515
02:54:48,100 --> 02:54:50,980
the goth chicks nearly seven seven ninety

2516
02:54:50,980 --> 02:54:53,600
oh now he has more questions here

2517
02:54:53,600 --> 02:54:56,500
oh and why is paris this is again from omg it's dupes

2518
02:54:56,500 --> 02:54:59,940
oh and why is paris hilton so famous for making a porn video

2519
02:54:59,940 --> 02:55:03,860
i wish i could get a girl famous for having sex with me just so i can say

2520
02:55:03,860 --> 02:55:06,740
doomy there's a future in it

2521
02:55:06,740 --> 02:55:08,300
it

2522
02:55:08,300 --> 02:55:11,180
uh... yeah

2523
02:55:11,180 --> 02:55:13,780
There's a future in it.

2524
02:55:13,780 --> 02:55:18,100
DO ME NOW!

2525
02:55:18,100 --> 02:55:22,720
Honestly, she's famous probably because she's rich, because her parents are rich.

2526
02:55:22,720 --> 02:55:24,680
She's famous because she

2527
02:55:24,680 --> 02:55:26,460
blew her way to the top, literally.

2528
02:55:26,460 --> 02:55:30,660
DarkTetsuya wants to know, if Konami were to make a new challenge remix, what song

2529
02:55:30,660 --> 02:55:36,320
would you like to see?

2530
02:55:36,320 --> 02:55:40,200
Cowgirl Survivor. No, shut up! Shut up right now!

2531
02:55:40,200 --> 02:55:47,200
I need a challenge remix. Oh, like Oni. Yeah, remember back in Max 2 when they were trying to keep the series fresh, you know?

2532
02:55:47,200 --> 02:55:51,200
Well, then I fucking want Butterfly Oni. No, I guess we already had that.

2533
02:55:51,200 --> 02:55:53,200
You can't do that, the lights didn't show. Ah, shut up.

2534
02:55:53,200 --> 02:55:57,200
Can we do UltraMix 2 stuff?

2535
02:55:57,200 --> 02:55:59,200
I suppose. How about Gyruss?

2536
02:55:59,200 --> 02:56:01,200
I guess you could do that.

2537
02:56:01,200 --> 02:56:02,200
That's what I want. I want Gyruss.

2538
02:56:02,200 --> 02:56:06,200
No, what they should honestly do is like, you know, I don't know.

2539
02:56:06,200 --> 02:56:18,200
I thought the whole idea with doing those Oni remixes was a cool idea. I mean, it kept the series fresh. It was like, ooh, that's kind of neat, you know, because they remixed, you know, all these songs, and then they just said, you know what, we just don't care anymore.

2540
02:56:19,200 --> 02:56:26,200
Let's give them another erotic song and put some iToy support in there. You won't know the difference. I'll shut them up.

2541
02:56:27,200 --> 02:56:31,200
We'll change the color of the interface, and then we'll tell them that we're starting over and we'll stop.

2542
02:56:31,200 --> 02:56:42,400
I think it's time to put the nail in the coffin of this lovely program known as Orange

2543
02:56:42,400 --> 02:56:45,720
Lounge Radio and this mediocre show we had tonight.

2544
02:56:45,720 --> 02:56:49,640
I hope you found it to be as okay as I did.

2545
02:56:49,640 --> 02:56:52,680
Download our podcast, which is sure to be ten times better.

2546
02:56:52,680 --> 02:56:53,680
No, I'm kidding.

2547
02:56:53,680 --> 02:56:54,680
I kid.

2548
02:56:54,680 --> 02:56:55,680
Our show's awesome.

2549
02:56:55,680 --> 02:56:57,080
We're the best thing ever.

2550
02:56:57,080 --> 02:57:00,680
And so, you know, congratulations, you're a part of it.

2551
02:57:00,680 --> 02:57:07,680
Your final thoughts, Bradley. The loudmouth who can't shut up during our show so we can do a show here. Bradley, your final thought.

2552
02:57:10,680 --> 02:57:14,680
Uh, yeah, goodbye. And good fish and stuff like that.

2553
02:57:15,680 --> 02:57:16,680
Loki.

2554
02:57:17,680 --> 02:57:26,680
You know, the brand new trailer for Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is quite creepy and I want to see where the world's now. I don't want to wait until the end of the month.

2555
02:57:26,680 --> 02:57:30,080
Dark Sakura

2556
02:57:30,080 --> 02:57:34,360
These people are pissing me off

2557
02:57:34,360 --> 02:57:38,840
Reject ball psychons. Fucking make fun of Britney Spears!

2558
02:57:38,840 --> 02:57:42,600
And my final thought is I hate myself and I want to die

2559
02:57:42,600 --> 02:57:46,120
And I gotta go get that shirt out of the dryer so I can wear it tonight

2560
02:57:46,120 --> 02:57:49,680
And I have to go back to my castle

2561
02:57:49,680 --> 02:57:53,680
Dark Sakura

2562
02:57:53,680 --> 02:57:58,680
Every day I polish my revolver, and I shoot my head, like a rock star.

2563
02:57:58,680 --> 02:58:04,680
Alright, the final word of the show, I'm taking it tonight, because I don't get the final show often enough.

2564
02:58:04,680 --> 02:58:07,680
Tonight's final word, one word to sum it all up, you guys.

2565
02:58:07,680 --> 02:58:14,680
Oh yes, before I give you the final word, don't forget, check out our website, check out our podcast, vote for us on Podcast Alley, vote for us on Live 365,

2566
02:58:14,680 --> 02:58:21,680

2567
02:58:21,680 --> 02:58:27,000
Alright, the last word of the show is snirty.

2568
02:58:27,000 --> 02:58:32,720
That does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live.

2569

And now, here is your fortune cookie message of the day.

2572
02:59:15,560 --> 02:59:33,560
I'm searching and I'll melt into you What a fear in my heart, but you're so supreme

2573
02:59:33,560 --> 02:59:43,560
I'd give my life, not for honor, but for you

2574
02:59:44,560 --> 02:59:55,560
In my time, there'll be no one else

2575
02:59:55,560 --> 03:00:05,560
Just cry, miss the way I fly to see you

2576
03:00:05,560 --> 03:00:16,560
I'm still in a tree-snake-eater

2577
03:00:16,560 --> 03:00:22,560
Someday you'll go through the rain

2578
03:00:22,560 --> 03:00:27,560
Someday you'll feed on a tree frog

2579
03:00:27,560 --> 03:00:33,060
It's your deal, the trial, to survive

2580
03:00:33,060 --> 03:00:39,060
For the day we see new light

2581
03:00:39,060 --> 03:00:42,060
I give my life

2582
03:00:42,060 --> 03:00:50,060
Not for honor, but for you

2583
03:00:50,060 --> 03:01:01,140
In my time, there'll be no one else

2584
03:01:01,140 --> 03:01:11,140
Crying, it's the way I'd like to be, ooh

2585
03:01:11,140 --> 03:01:23,140
I'm still in a dream, Snake Eater

2586
03:01:23,140 --> 03:01:52,860

2587
03:01:53,140 --> 03:02:22,100

2589
03:02:27,380 --> 03:02:31,420
You didn't put the retarded ferret on the katamari.

2590
03:02:31,420 --> 03:02:33,100
My bad.

2591
03:02:33,100 --> 03:02:37,520
I can't do it today.

2592
03:02:37,520 --> 03:02:40,600
Aw, poor thing, alright, we're leaving.

2593
03:02:40,600 --> 03:02:44,140
We'll see you later, have a good one, we'll see you next week.

2594
03:02:44,140 --> 03:02:45,140
Bye!

2595
03:02:45,140 --> 03:02:47,860

2596
03:02:47,860 --> 03:02:48,860

Bye.
