169	2831	Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, week of May 30th, 2005.
2931	14101	You're tuned in to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your podcast home for all the latest video game news and gamer chat.
14341	17824	Now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.
19673	24476	Hello, once again, everybody, and a happy Memorial Day week to you guys.
25196	27017	Hope you had fun with your three-day weekend.
27417	30739	Some of you guys downloading this on Monday, maybe you're still enjoying that three-day weekend.
31279	35582	Let us not forget the veterans that gave us this day and fought for our country.
35962	38563	Don't forget the masses of the retail.
40464	42565	Those who have to work on Memorial Day.
42625	43646	That too, that too.
44206	48909	The voice you hear back there is my lovely co-host, Jamie Summers, Dark Sakura.
49383	50164	Yo, yo, yo.
71420	75341	No Skype in here, because Skype cuts out too much for us, so we can't do the Skype thing.
75381	77422	Yeah, we're not like, you know, from yesterday.
77482	78863	We were freshly purchased today.
80063	80743	Big thank you.
81103	81703	Big thank you.
81804	91487	Starting off the show tonight, before we get into any games whatsoever, big, big thank you to iPotter.org and the one and only Adam Curry for, I guess, noticing us this week.
91507	91987	Best hair.
92589	92829	Ever.
93150	93850	I agreed.
94631	96692	When I think of the 80s, I will always think of that hair.
97053	102917	But seriously, we got noticed on iPodder.org this week, which is really weird because we didn't submit anything over there.
102977	106780	So I don't know if one of our fans did it or what, but we just showed up on there suddenly.
106840	114026	And usually I'm pretty good about submitting our show to like, you know, Podcast Alley, Podcast Pickle, Podcast This, Podcast That, whatever shows up.
114046	115507	They have a Podcast Pickle?
115527	116447	Yes, believe it or not.
116768	116888	It's...
117646	118687	They got podcast everything.
118747	119287	It's the new thing.
119387	128393	They should do like from Jay and Silent Bob, podcastpoopshoot.com Somebody is probably registering it as we speak.
128773	136558	But regardless, for whatever reason, we never got submitted to iPodder.org until this week, and it was huge for our traffic.
136638	138339	So welcome to all our new subscribers.
138799	141161	Just a quick FYI, what we are, what we do.
141881	144463	Orange Lounge Radio, we've been around for like three years.
144483	146284	We've only been podcasting since January.
147265	162744	Internet radio station that runs live 24 hours a day, 7 days a week Dedicated to rhythm and music gaming But this is part of our expansion into other video games We want to talk about other games and other gamings And video games that don't suck And news that you guys really want to know about So that's what we're all about
163144	185796	and we just want to produce for you guys like a 30-40 minute show something long enough for you guys to listen to while you're commuting just to keep you up on all the news and all that stuff so and sometimes we like to argue and bicker back and forth and we do sometimes we do some things shut up we do bitch we do some things that are outside of games sometimes as well like Dark Sakura's advice column which we'll get to a little later exactly but first off
186216	186877	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
201338	201678	What's up?
201718	202539	How was your gaming week?
204180	207663	I played PSO Blueburst for like four hours yesterday.
208404	210625	I quit Final Fantasy XI yesterday.
210726	213027	Yes, I quit Final Fantasy XI finally as well.
213288	217731	And the clouds parted and the angels came down and sang and it was pretty groovy.
219232	221294	And I played some Silent Hill 3.
221714	222715	I'm close to the end.
223413	225475	I'm in the hospital right now.
225915	226496	Oh, very cool.
226956	227396	You know what, though?
227437	229839	You know you're addicted to MMOs, though, seriously.
230199	233442	When you quit Final Fantasy XI and then freaking sign up for Guild Wars.
233562	235864	I mean, did I really accomplish anything?
236224	238926	Did you really accomplish anything going from Final Fantasy XI to Blue Burst?
239067	246233	Yeah, but with Blue Burst, it's windowed and I can do other crap while my little femoral is... femoral is...
247926	252850	And I don't really see it as necessarily leaving one game for another.
252970	257232	I just kind of see it as, I'm bored with this toy and I want a new toy now.
257833	262316	I've always gone back to PSO, but when Ragnarok 2 comes out, oh, you better watch.
262336	264177	Yeah, what is this, the fourth time on PSO?
264197	268520	You got Dreamcast, GameCube, Xbox, now PC.
269501	274604	Yeah, but the Dreamcast one pissed me off because it wouldn't work with the broadband converter they had.
275482	282084	I didn't own a Dreamcast until years later when they were like $50 and I only bought it so I could emulate Nintendo games on it.
282345	287506	But then I discovered that Soul Calibur is really cool and I kind of went back and rediscovered all these Dreamcast games.
287927	291228	Soul Calibur is all about playing that game with the damn fishing rod.
292088	293749	Because the fishing rod is analog.
294869	296930	And when you sling it, it hits buttons.
297370	298710	The triggers inside are buttons.
299171	301832	So Rod Calibur is the most fun ever.
302292	302512	Wow.
303459	303900	Step on the Cat
324116	324797	She likes it.
324817	325658	Is that a Flash game?
326018	326659	No, no.
326879	328321	It's when Shermie is on the floor.
328341	330343	Is that going to be an Xbox 360 launch title?
330423	331244	And you step on her.
331424	332165	Not very hard.
332625	337891	And she just flattens herself like this big ball of cat fat and looks up and goes, meow.
338672	339393	Okay, you can go.
339793	339973	Meow.
340053	340754	And she scatters off.
342227	344129	Step on the Cat, her favorite thing.
344809	346190	Loki, what games have you been playing?
348011	352214	Actually, I've played Final Fantasy XI because you old people suck.
352494	353695	Addict, addict.
353895	356657	Oh yeah, well at least I'm not leaving for another MMO, okay?
357017	358558	At least he's low.
358578	360639	I don't know if that's better or worse, but anyways.
361059	366223	So yeah, I have my character who's level 58 now, finally, and I bought new armor.
366977	368178	We'll play FFXI for food
395492	398535	Oh no no, we'll give head for Final Fantasy, I don't know.
398775	400417	Alright, let it finish.
400878	401598	We got news to get to.
401779	407084	Anyways, so I play Final Fantasy, I play a little bit of my cell phone game, Worms.
407104	408285	Yeah, you remember that game, Worms?
408646	410988	Well, it doesn't really transition well over to the cell phone.
411008	412830	A lot of games don't, FYI.
412950	418156	For some reason, they just get pissed off that I'm kicking their ass, and they just...
418766	419787	They just commit suicide.
419827	422768	They just walk right off the screen into the water and die.
422788	425830	And I'm like, what the hell kind of AI is that?
425890	431093	Seriously, mobile games now is all about the retro factor.
432113	433794	Or it's like Bejeweled on your phone.
434655	436736	It's like, whoa, $5 for this piece of crap.
436756	437376	Yay.
437576	438717	Bejeweled came on my phone.
438737	442819	Yeah, so I played that, and that's pretty much it.
442859	444840	Really haven't played much as far as games this week.
445373	445633	All right.
446814	453080	Myself, I actually picked up a copy of Fable because Fable was running on sale, $30.
453801	456963	And it was one of those Xbox games where everybody was like, dude, if you have an Xbox, you have to have Fable.
457163	457664	You have to have it.
457984	459666	Because it's like the one RPG.
460737	462979	I think if you hang around in the town too long they chase you off
487043	492792	It depends on if you're good or bad, but you can completely play the game as a good guy or you can completely play as a bad guy.
493192	496617	So you kind of forge your own path, which is kind of neat.
497458	501965	And you can have the people refer to you as Arseface because you get to choose your own title later on.
502705	506007	And your character changes in appearance depending on whether you're good or bad.
506107	509769	And if you have your arm cut off, they call you stubby or something.
509969	511370	Graphics, pretty nice.
511570	515012	But the only problem I noticed with Fable is that sometimes it's a little bit skippy.
515592	517093	Kind of like has some loading skips.
517593	520975	Awful long loading times in between areas though for such small areas.
521575	526318	I'm kind of nitpicking a little bit though because honestly, the cutscene graphics are really great.
527218	530620	I really am impressed with the graphics mostly, but just the little skips were a little bit annoying.
530640	532702	The sound is awesome, the sound in the game.
533082	539045	It's got its own original score, I think, that was done by Danny Elfman, at least one of the songs, but the rest of the music really fits into that.
539405	543168	The only problem I had with the sound, though, is that sometimes it was overbearing.
544248	550412	Like, for instance, this one scene, I'm trying to get trained on magic, and I can't even hear the guy talking because all I can hear is the waterfall behind me.
550973	554294	So, the sound kind of gets annoying sometimes, but the score is really great.
554354	556534	Like, they could release the score as a CD and probably sell it.
557254	558995	But overall, I think the game's kind of fun.
559295	560875	It has a lot of fun stuff going for it.
561535	567017	So I'd probably give it, like, I don't know, like, I'd give it an above-average score, like a 3 out of 5 stars.
568157	568937	I'm not sure yet, though.
568957	570477	I still gotta really play a little more with it.
570497	573298	I'm only, like, two hours into it, so the verdict's still out, but I'm having fun with it.
573538	574698	Actually, I did get a new game.
575019	575399	What'd you get?
575719	576859	Well, Dan bought me Technic Beat.
577559	578039	Oh, what'd you think?
578259	579020	I haven't played it yet.
580200	582081	I watched you play and I'm like, oh, Technic Beat.
582521	583601	Tell us about it next week then.
584482	586242	It's still sitting on my desk.
586703	592045	For those just tuning in, I give Smart Bomb a 1 out of 5 because it sucks ass.
592185	592805	And why is that?
593125	600908	Because, first off, the game has such long loading times and the puzzles are fucking hard and it makes you want to actually throw your PSP.
601348	601648	DarkSakura.com
618570	618890	DarkSakura
636358	637740	and X-Button, I believe.
638400	640642	And you play it basically vertically.
641063	648730	And there's also another game called Star Soldier, which is going to be coming out, which is also played that way, just like the old school vertical shooter games.
648850	650291	That was Star Soldier.
650331	652373	Wasn't that a Sega CD game?
652914	653294	I don't know.
653314	653935	I have no idea.
653955	653995	No...
655891	656652	There was a game.
656692	658753	Actually, no, I'm thinking TurboGrafxDuo.
658773	660114	There was a game called Star Soldier.
660134	661575	Well, maybe this is it.
663056	664957	Hudson did a lot of games for TurboGrafx, didn't they?
665177	683010	Right, and they did a parody version called Star Parodia, which you could play as Twinby, or you could play as Bomberman, because Hudson also did Bomberman, or you could play as a flying PC engine.
683757	686719	I just think the idea of the PSP on its side is cute.
686879	687339	I don't know why.
687999	689060	But it's not innovative.
689160	691021	Bandai already did that with the WonderSwan.
691401	694743	But how many people in America played the WonderSwan?
695063	695824	You and who else?
696923	697483	Thank you for watching!
714508	717570	So it's not a new idea, but it's something a lot of people haven't seen.
717930	718190	Yeah.
718330	718630	Granted.
719130	719391	Alright.
720031	722352	Anyway, let's move on to some actual gaming news.
723292	735219	Following up from E3, you guys remember when we went to the Final Fantasy concert, that guy who was emceeing, he's a voice actor in the game, and he said that he would be at E3 that Wednesday, because he was the voice of Tidus in the game.
735799	739281	I never saw him there, but of course I wasn't hanging out at the Square Enix booth the whole time.
739761	741882	But I remember whispering to Loker, I said, I
742062	744844	I might have missed it, but again, the E3 is so packed and crowded, I don't know.
769179	777242	The Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists are trying to negotiate a new agreement with game publishers regarding voice acting.
777622	783844	Basically what it comes down to is that right now voice actors are paid a one-time fee up front for their services.
784656	785856	But no, no, no.
785916	790258	Voice actors want some type of payment based on the successes of the game.
790318	791378	Like, you know, residuals.
791698	794039	If the game sells so many copies, we want a cut of it.
794059	794699	They want royalties.
794959	795600	Yeah, basically.
796080	797320	So what do you think?
797600	798441	Does that sound fair?
798461	799141	They're entitled.
799901	805003	It's their talent being lent to the, you know, it happens to regular stage actors.
806187	812374	They still make money off, you know, like, I was watching some special about Greece, and they still get a regular check.
813175	813415	Yeah.
813776	815698	For any money that the movie still makes.
816793	819014	It's only like a dollar or so, but they still get it.
819134	820155	Still something.
820175	822456	I think that the same should apply to the voice actors.
822896	835721	You know, what about the flip side of this, where a lot of folks say, and I tend to think about this a little bit too, whereas you have the voice actors in movie-based games, where the game just isn't the same without the original voice actor.
835761	837762	Take, for instance, I don't know, Buffy in the Buffy game.
838183	839463	She wasn't in it.
839623	841104	It wasn't Sarah Michelle Gellar, right?
841204	842464	Right, but everybody else was there.
842544	843245	Did that kind of...
843965	846887	Did that one voice not being right kind of detract from the game?
847067	847528	I don't know.
847848	848509	Maybe, I don't know.
848549	849790	She sounded just like her.
850190	851491	Then let me think of a better example.
851551	854913	Say you were trying to replace Marlon Brando in the upcoming Godfather game.
855034	856275	That just wouldn't be the same, right?
856295	857195	I don't know, maybe.
857235	858096	It's debatable.
858116	858636	Not necessarily.
858756	864681	Here's an example, kind of an old example, but Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis, it was not Harrison Ford doing Indiana Jones voice, still fair.
864821	865381	Felt fine to me.
887691	890313	I don't know, is that an option?
890373	892135	Can they really break the union thing?
892175	899321	Are they going to set themselves up for a real... I think what it comes down to is they need to actually be negotiating their contract a little bit better.
900142	900982	That's what it comes down to.
901223	903665	If you want to get paid by royalties, don't take the job then.
903745	905706	Okay, then let me kind of rephrase my question this way.
905806	907948	How important is voice acting in a game to you?
908529	912212	Pretty important since a lot of the games are reliant on that to go along with the visual.
913704	914565	Night Trap 3 points out of 100
937708	939788	That's how much I care about it.
940108	940869	It really doesn't matter.
941069	942829	Good voice acting, to me, can make or break a game.
943049	947630	I think voice acting can make a good game better, but I don't think it can save a game.
947990	950011	I mean, a crappy game is still a crappy game.
950071	955012	You could have the guy who does all the movie trailers, who has the sexiest voice in the world.
955032	955992	Or Mr. Movie Phone.
956672	957472	Yeah, the Movie Phone guy.
957512	959673	You could have either of them in the game, and if the game sucks, the game sucks.
960613	966374	You know, though, especially, though, for games that are ported over from Japanese games where they redid all the voices...
967455	968256	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
996153	997694	Why do we have to fight all the time, guys?
998174	999155	Can't we all just get along?
999695	1000196	How about a hug?
1000376	1001276	Sorry, Rob, that doesn't work.
1001516	1002037	How about a hug?
1002477	1005919	Can't the voice actors in the gaming publishing companies just hug?
1009001	1010502	Xbox 360's on the way.
1010522	1013503	$300 is the rumored price point.
1014124	1017786	I always thought 360 would probably be what they'd charge for it.
1017826	1020047	You know, ha ha ha, get it, Xbox 360, 360.
1020728	1022529	And they're still saying that that's a possibility.
1023297	1026998	But the $300 is kind of the target price point for the new system.
1027399	1030280	So based on what you saw at E3, is this worth $300?
1030340	1030620	Fuck yes.
1030640	1031840	Really?
1033141	1034021	It was brilliant.
1034361	1034681	Really?
1034941	1035141	Yes.
1035441	1037342	I paid $300 for my PlayStation 2.
1038142	1038603	Might as well.
1039043	1040643	I paid $400 for my JPS 2.
1040823	1042704	Allow me to be the first to say no.
1043004	1044325	I will wait for the first price cut.
1044585	1050267	I am more... I'm not really sold on any of the launch titles yet.
1051107	1056051	My opinion could change, but there is nothing on the Xbox that's making me go, I have to have this system when it launches.
1056451	1057532	Do I want the system?
1057652	1058773	Yes, eventually.
1058813	1059254	Wait, wait, wait.
1060134	1061415	Here's what's selling it for me.
1061636	1061936	Alright.
1062136	1062336	What?
1062496	1063477	DOA Volleyball 2.
1065258	1067680	I know it's not announced, but it's coming.
1068941	1069542	It will be good.
1069702	1071003	I'm looking forward to DOA 4.
1072104	1073465	I'm actually looking forward to Quake 4.
1073985	1074586	It looks pretty cool.
1075967	1077548	Half-Life 2 is on it.
1077668	1078989	I'm honestly more excited about PS3.
1079915	1080215	Right now.
1080416	1082358	And so I feel like I want to save my money and get a PS3.
1082438	1083920	I did also go to the PS3 demo.
1083940	1086323	Well, you know I'm going to have them both, so it doesn't matter.
1086423	1095393	Honestly, when it gets down to about the Xbox 360 time, we'll already have the game room at my work and we'll have a 360 there, so I really don't need to buy one.
1095513	1097256	Here's what I'll bet they'll do.
1097476	1098998	I'll bet you anything this is what happens.
1099318	1100019	Although I could be wrong.
1101343	1102843	They'll sell the system for like $300.
1103344	1105004	They'll do like a bare bones thing for $300.
1105564	1118028	But if you buy the 360, they'll do some kind of cheap little time where it's like, you know, the 360 pack or something that'll go for $360 and it comes with a game and like Xbox Live for so many months or something, you know, additional.
1118048	1120008	It'll come with a game.
1120048	1121409	It'll come with another controller.
1121449	1122029	It'll come with...
1122509	1124791	Brand new game skins!
1125011	1125831	Woo!
1125851	1127252	That new power button thing.
1127312	1133137	I do think that they are being smart with how they're combating the PS3 release because they're going to be doing Halo 3.
1134117	1134938	That is smart.
1135238	1136259	That is very smart.
1136399	1139401	It is, but I think the hardcore gamers are not going to be affected.
1139441	1141462	I did stay in line, though, for both demos.
1143104	1144605	And I have to say, though, that...
1145569	1153454	You know, the Xbox 360, I'm really looking forward to a lot, because not only is it a system, but it's also a multimedia docking station.
1153574	1156116	And they even showed a picture of a PSP hooking up to it.
1156756	1159618	Anything, basically, that's USB firewire is going to hook up to it.
1159778	1160299	And that...
1161119	1166664	All it's going to be is just, oh look, I can download my MP3s that I bought on Xbox Live to my PC.
1184522	1192262	My MP3 player, which I think you're right where it's going to an entertainment system, not just gaming.
1193431	1201537	They're also showing this one about designing your own shirts on there, having them shipped out as a t-shirt and you can sell them through the Xbox system.
1201557	1202237	They had it on there.
1202477	1209122	Are they going to be crappy like a certain nameless site which does a lot of shirt printing for people and then the shirts wash out after they're washed?
1209222	1209602	I don't know.
1209662	1210683	It didn't say anything about that.
1210863	1219368	It was saying though that you can market your art, you can show your designs, you can share, you can create a community real-time chat.
1219649	1222490	Wow, you know, last time I checked I thought that's what the internet was for.
1223771	1228835	Why do I have to pay $300 for this console that I can do on the internet for free?
1229735	1231256	No, sorry, I'm not going to do that.
1231676	1232397	I don't give a crap.
1232557	1234678	A gaming console is a gaming console is a gaming console.
1234718	1236640	It's not a multimedia device.
1236880	1238981	If I wanted a multimedia device, I'd buy a media PC.
1239081	1241122	Oh wait, no, I'm not going to touch that either because they're expensive.
1241143	1242463	How about a big whatever to all of that?
1242864	1245445	A system is only good as the games that are on it.
1246186	1246646	There you go.
1246746	1252630	Of course, though, I was more impressed with the PS3 demo and I really don't want to be a hoarder Sony, but
1253234	1253394	What?
1253414	1253994	The controller.
1280322	1282982	The controller is going to be mappable.
1283022	1285783	Basically, it's a custom controller.
1285823	1288644	Every game that you play is going to be a brand new controller.
1289724	1290164	We'll see.
1290584	1297345	I think that it's going to be like that... What was that Atari thing where you hooked it to your head and then you blink and it makes a move left?
1297465	1299265	That's retarded.
1299325	1302046	Please don't.
1302146	1303526	Duke Nukem forever.
1304946	1306467	Forever before it comes out.
1307207	1307307	Um...
1308240	1314346	The message boards on Duke Nukem Forever's website, located... I don't even know where it is.
1314366	1315227	3D Realms' site.
1315487	1318751	On their message board, they're teasing it.
1318771	1328981	15 enemies supposed to be showing up in there, and they're saying, they're swearing, a ton is done, we have hundreds of props that you can place in the world, and the artists just continue to pump stuff out.
1330495	1332697	Alright, they're saying they're going to show it at next year's E3.
1332717	1335861	I have two words for that.
1335961	1337082	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1337582	1339224	Let's see the goods, people.
1339384	1340165	Let's see the goods.
1341467	1343649	But it makes me sad we haven't had a Duke Nukem.
1343669	1345311	Yeah, just like the Phantom.
1345351	1346191	Where'd the Phantom go?
1346211	1346652	Oh, that's right.
1346832	1347713	It's not there.
1347753	1348274	In the trash.
1348394	1348674	Alright.
1348934	1350876	Yeah, but the Gizmondo's still hanging about.
1352738	1353139	Alright.
1353760	1356861	Let's get to the advice column.
1356901	1362944	Because, you know, if we sat here and we talked about games all day long, we'd have no time to go out and go to golf clubs.
1363464	1368366	So we have to fill your heads with useless...
1370875	1376320	Today's advice is how to survive in Whitewater Rapids after falling out of your raft.
1376340	1377361	Number one.
1397580	1401843	If you were thrown from the raft, lie on your back, face up with your feet facing downstream.
1403604	1401843	2.
1404344	1407066	If your raft is still accessible, swim for it and hold on.
1407346	1410909	Even if it is upside down, it can still provide protection from rocks and other obstacles.
1412790	1410909	3.
1413270	1415131	Be aware of the current and of river conditions.
1415552	1419374	If you get to a calm area between rapids, vigorously swim for the shore.
1420715	1419374	4.
1421175	1426879	Be prepared for a hole in the river where water recirculates, creating a whirlpool that can pull you under.
1427739	1432602	If you are caught in a hole, plunge your feet down as far as you can and actively swim to the bottom.
1432942	1435323	You will soon be pulled from the hole by the current.
1435783	1437124	But my final piece of advice?
1437364	1437584	Yes?
1438765	1440646	Just don't go whitewater rafting.
1441967	1444148	Go, like, hiking or something.
1444468	1445809	At least the bears are kinder.
1448270	1448910	Thank you for that.
1449531	1452232	Useful, very useful piece of information.
1452372	1453673	Everybody on the internet can use.
1453893	1455834	The bears are more afraid of you than they are of them.
1456154	1457215	Yeah, so throw sticks at them.
1459042	1461404	Loki, you were playing the Matrix Online for what, like a week?
1462624	1462865	Yep.
1463045	1466127	You were a big fan of the Matrix movies, even the second and third ones, right?
1466867	1468368	I still watch them.
1468668	1476694	I would have liked the second movie to have been what I read as the preview script, but apparently they punked it down.
1477274	1480016	So how do you feel about this in the Matrix Online this week?
1480276	1481397	They offed Morpheus!
1481994	1483835	I think it's too early to be doing this, to be honest.
1483875	1499948	Because, I mean, granted, the game, everyone loved the fact that the main characters were in it and stuff, and I thought that they could drag it a little longer, but just giving the basic description of what happened, you know, apparently it looks like, I guess, Morpheus... I got it.
1500148	1500608	Oh, you got it?
1500628	1500868	Okay.
1500968	1507333	Well, anyways, Morpheus is basically, one of the plotlines, or storylines through this, is he's searching for Neo's body.
1507373	1508114	He's trying to get...
1508294	1510576	Neo back, because I think he thinks he's alive or something like that.
1510616	1525466	Anyways, so he's trying to recover Neo's body from the machines, but when the machines refuse to return Neo's remains, Morpheus began rampaging through Mega City, which is the city that this all takes place in, deadening code bombs strong enough to threaten the Matrix itself.
1525846	1529509	The machines responded by sending an assassin after Morpheus.
1529549	1531350	The assassin succeeded and Morpheus was killed.
1532667	1543892	and basically now there's a new story arc, I guess, where players in the game are now have the opportunity to investigate the circumstances of Morpheus' death and participate in the new Matrix saga.
1543972	1546794	So now they're trying to figure out who the assassin is, I guess.
1546894	1547314	I guess.
1547634	1549575	And really there's like three sides to this.
1549815	1550856	You have like, you have the...
1551736	1552657	We got a weird buzzing.
1552677	1553257	Sorry about that, guys.
1553677	1562982	You have the Zionist groups or whatever, and then you've got the, I guess, the Machines, and then some other... And the One-Armed Man.
1563542	1564242	Yeah, the One-Armed Man.
1564822	1572806	But basically, what it comes down to is at any time during this whole thing, they could just say, oh, we're going to resurrect him, and he's back.
1572886	1574547	So, you know, whatever.
1574667	1576328	I think it's a little really do that, just
1578703	1579703	It was his sister.
1579863	1584466	It's always their sister that kills them.
1584586	1589128	I won Matrix Online right there.
1590108	1590729	Well, guess what?
1590749	1593210	They've killed off all of them already, so who's left?
1594814	1595415	I couldn't tell you.
1596596	1597216	Jada Pinkett?
1599238	1599398	No.
1601380	1601741	All right.
1603442	1605304	Let's talk about this article.
1605504	1606785	I think this one's kind of interesting.
1607386	1618856	I was looking at Slashdot earlier this week, and they actually linked to somebody's blog, and this is on a site called corpnews.com, and somebody's just talking about E3, and I'm just going to kind of just
1619056	1620257	E3 is no longer useful as a trade show
1641096	1665477	The folks that work at the Best Buy, the EB Games, the CompUSA That it's become more about these booth babes and showing things off And that it's not very professional And the only place that you can find the professionalism Is to go to the upstairs area where it's nice and quiet And they're basically saying that a lot of the game companies have gotten a little more And I'm sorry, I'm paraphrasing If you want to read the complete story, go to the website Um
1667101	1670123	They're basically saying that a lot of the companies are getting very stingy.
1670423	1676527	Quote, companies like Vivendi and EA will ask for a name right off the bat before admitting you to their corporate Shangri-La.
1676827	1687994	Blizzard was running World of Warcraft media demos on the noisy show floor, and Nintendo did not even have enough press kits for all media, saying, we only give those out to major media outlets.
1688294	1688814	I got one.
1689234	1692276	Yeah, and I'm thinking DarkSakra got one somehow.
1692476	1693557	Major media outlets.
1693697	1695278	Then again, I did get mine on Wednesday.
1696372	1696853	Oh, maybe.
1696873	1700557	We're a major media outlet, right?
1700577	1707464	Well, the thing is that once we get our paperwork back, we're going to be up there.
1708325	1709186	We can only get bigger.
1710227	1713630	So it's good that they're willing to give us growing people.
1713650	1715312	Granted, folks, we cover the news.
1715552	1717915	I mean, the gaming news better than, say, you know,
1718519	1719319	Fox News
1733786	1734887	To get them excited.
1735447	1737629	It's basically word of mouth advertising is what they're trying to do.
1738370	1742333	And then for the ones who are true media, they're saving the real juicy bits.
1742853	1749618	Like when I got to play Popocoros or seeing the new Front Mission, that was pretty cool.
1750579	1753560	or the Call of Cthulhu demo that they were showing.
1755220	1761361	There's also where you talk to their reps, find out, hey, this is what's going on.
1761461	1762201	These are our dates.
1762261	1763182	This is what it's going to do.
1763402	1765102	This is what our business is looking like.
1765522	1775664	I do agree that you're going to, that's why they have those press rooms so that you can go up and get figures, get the business side of things, get dates, things like that.
1776164	1779165	See the stuff that they're not going to put out on the main floor.
1779745	1783307	I really do think that the main floor is a method of advertising.
1784547	1786348	But that's not always the way it used to be.
1786608	1788849	If you think about it, it's really ballooned in the past few years.
1788869	1794771	And I think that's what this guy's kind of trying to say because he's saying he's been for like the past six years and just he's kind of watched this whole thing evolve.
1794811	1797992	And that's what I think the core thing is, is that E3's really evolved.
1798293	1803875	I mean, if you think about it, even just like four years ago, did it seem like E3 was such this big deal that like
1804375	1808797	TV stations were broadcasting live and the internet was lit up with talk and all that.
1808877	1813979	Sure, you heard about E3 and you read about it in magazines, but was it really such a freaking big deal as it is now?
1814120	1816581	I mean, now it's like the holiday of gamers, it seems like.
1816621	1818622	That's how things are and the companies are catering to it.
1818662	1819882	I think it's pretty smart on their end.
1820142	1821003	Yeah, it's interesting.
1821143	1821723	Loki, any thoughts?
1821897	1830199	I agree with some of the aspects like when he's talking about like basically your fry cooks of the video game industry getting into E3.
1830819	1835621	Granted that there are these people getting into E3 and this is why you have your three hour waits to go see stuff.
1835981	1848204	It's because of all these nobodies that are entering into E3 that have really no business being there other than the fact that oh I work for a video game or a game store or I work at a store that sells games or
1848604	1852228	I think that the retailers need to actually have some sort of signed release.
1852268	1859016	If it's not management, then the general everybody else would need a signed release form to go with it.
1859136	1860437	You provide that with your credentials.
1861218	1866464	There's also the people, though, who get in once, and then every year they get their new invite.
1868208	1870251	I got mine this year the same way.
1870512	1877264	Do you think that's because maybe the attendance thing is a selling point of the whole show so they want more people to go even if it's cheapening the show?
1877404	1878226	It is advertisement.
1879448	1880690	It puts money in their pockets.
1882310	1887691	And there's still all those people who are willing to go out there and shell out the 300 some odd dollars it costs for a badge.
1888271	1890112	I think there will be changes next year.
1890152	1892852	I think it's inevitable there will be some type of change next year.
1892952	1893813	But who knows?
1893893	1894793	I've been proven wrong before.
1895933	1896293	Alright.
1897093	1897674	Moving on.
1898314	1899334	I thought this was interesting.
1899614	1901775	1up.com actually ran this story earlier this week.
1901795	1902515	I thought it was cute.
1902535	1902815	80 year old
1904329	1905089	Thank you for watching!
1922040	1922820	Thank you for watching!
1941529	1948752	and she got a call from gaming legend Billy Mitchell who offered to loan her a Qbert machine to practice and win back the title.
1949152	1952614	So gaming grandma's back to reclaim the Qbert throne.
1952814	1955795	I was going to laugh if she was playing Halo 2 or something like that, you know.
1956916	1958056	I'm going to get you!
1958136	1962118	In general, because I suck at Qbert and I played a whole crap load of it on my Clicca Vision.
1963104	1963505	Me too.
1963525	1964285	Can you imagine?
1964365	1970850	I mean, it's bad enough getting fragged by the 12-year-olds on Xbox Live who then proceed to tease you and, you know, call you names.
1971150	1972851	Can you imagine getting shot by Grandma?
1975574	1976054	You know what?
1976114	1977015	Unfortunately, yes.
1977455	1982158	I remember back when I had my Nintendo and my mother played it more than I did.
1983379	1986362	Granted, my mother is only 17 years older than I am, but still.
1986742	1991445	The only game I could ever get my mother to play with me was Family Feud on the Commodore 64.
1992665	1995566	My mom was like freaking awesome at Super Mario Brothers.
1995706	1997027	Yeah, that's all foreign to me.
1997067	2001168	My parents... And she would regularly kick my ass at Dr. Mario.
2001368	2006930	But it's weird because my dad now watches G4 because he loved tech TV.
2007371	2012672	And although he's been kind of ticked off at the fact that when G4 kind of ate tech TV, all the shows got lost.
2013033	2014713	He's still... It's like he clings to it.
2015514	2019275	So I think because of that, he's picked up all this gaming knowledge, which is kind of impressive.
2019555	2020115	That's cute.
2020435	2020916	It is cute.
2020956	2021356	It's very cute.
2021376	2021896	My dad's cute.
2023550	2025291	Loki, is this going to be you someday?
2025311	2026891	80-year-old gaming grandpa?
2027331	2027551	Yeah.
2029072	2032092	Seriously, I'm going to be the coolest dad on the block.
2032232	2034393	I have my own goddamn video game cabinet.
2034953	2036434	How many dads can say that?
2037134	2040475	I remember the days before we had this hologram shit.
2041315	2042896	When I'm old, though.
2042976	2045776	I'll be in line as the 80-year-old grandpa.
2046216	2047197	Oh, you're getting a free kid?
2047357	2048777	Fuck that, give it for me!
2049357	2051158	I will still aspire...
2052264	2058038	to yell at kids who are walking on my lawn while I'm playing the PSP or something. 5.0.
2061570	2062890	My future, they won't be wearing pants.
2062910	2064091	Get off my lawn!
2064771	2066892	Give me back my video game!
2087978	2094962	I think the reason why the gaming site felt the need to run this story is that number three was Woot.
2096082	2096923	I hate that word.
2097483	2098023	Woot!
2098323	2100084	I'm surprised Pwned isn't on there.
2100605	2101665	I'm surprised that too.
2101705	2102606	Some other highlights.
2102626	2103406	This list is retarded.
2103506	2105067	Number one, Ginormous.
2105859	2106779	I use that word all the time.
2106799	2107260	I do use that.
2107400	2107980	I use it too.
2108020	2111441	Number two, confuzzled, whatever you want to say, confused and puzzled.
2111962	2120445	And lastly, one I think is too good to pass up, number nine, snert, snow that is dirty, which is a word I never heard before seeing that poll.
2120686	2123227	But then again, we live in California, so maybe that's what it's about.
2123487	2123987	All right.
2125708	2126108	All right.
2126208	2128029	I've got a couple more, just real quick.
2128109	2128749	Oh, yes, I'm sorry.
2128789	2131190	You had a couple stories from another website you wanted to share.
2131210	2131410	What's up?
2131430	2132591	Well, I just want to share these.
2133686	2140467	The Game Boy Micro, the brand new Game Boy Advance that they're getting you to buy, is going to be marketed as a media player.
2140788	2144248	Honestly, why do you really want to watch movies on a one-inch screen?
2144328	2146249	But whatever.
2146429	2150570	Basically, it's the Game Boy Micro bundled with the Play-Anne adapter.
2150850	2161312	For those who don't know, it uses the little SD cards to actually be able to play movies, and it plugs into your Game Boy Advance player, or your Game Boy Micro in this case.
2162413	2168379	So basically, it's a $70 value that they're going to be marketing with that.
2168479	2170822	So yeah, 2-inch screen movies.
2171182	2172483	You think that's going to be popular?
2172503	2173865	I don't know.
2174446	2179171	If you want to see what the Game Boy Micro looks like, you can go to OrangeZoneRadio.com and check out my pictures of E3.
2179602	2180222	There you go.
2180363	2180863	Nice plug.
2180883	2182384	He's so small.
2182964	2184165	It is really little, though.
2184585	2187787	I can't imagine playing a role-playing game where you have to read text on it, though.
2189248	2192991	Imagine trying to play Fire Emblem on that thing where you have to move your little tiny characters on it.
2193091	2194091	I can't imagine that.
2194332	2196533	I don't get the Game Boy Micro, but whatever.
2196733	2197714	I mean, whatever.
2198955	2200255	There could be worse things.
2200275	2201056	Like the Virtual Boy.
2201076	2201917	It didn't look too bad.
2203301	2205942	A couple other things, now we go to the PSP side of things.
2206822	2217624	Heavy.com, those folks behind the wonderful stuff like Pimp My Weapon and the music that sucks, they have new PSP content you can download from their website.
2217984	2220245	So go check that out, and that's Heavy.com.
2220965	2228867	And also, on the underground front here, they have the Rin version 1.18, which is the brand new Game Boy...
2229447	2253537	Color Emulator and they're working on right now a working version of SNES 9X which is the Super Nintendo Emulator to work on the version 1.5 PSPs which are all the US ones because currently all the ones that they have right now only work on the Japanese models the first launch ones which are version 1.0 that reminds me of the other thing I've been playing this week Final Fantasy 6 ROM translated by fans
2254611	2255032	Saken Densetsu 3
2270886	2271546	I heard about that.
2271787	2272467	I played it.
2272507	2273007	It's excellent.
2273107	2274848	I also miss playing the Car Ranger game.
2275228	2284552	And the final story I will leave you with is, and this is my thing saying that no copyright protection scheme is perfect.
2285253	2291395	There will be a loader in the near future to be able to play games off the memory cards on the PSP.
2291755	2292216	It's coming.
2292416	2294797	It'll be here soon and nothing's going to stop it.
2296418	2298559	Well, that sounds like fighting words.
2299259	2299519	All right.

2313664	2315085	Final thoughts, you guys, Loki.
2316665	2322926	I got to get me some more Final Fantasy XI time under my belt because I've been slacking lately.
2323947	2326947	And my final thought is it's clubbing time, DarkSakura.
2326967	2329288	I reject false MMOs.
