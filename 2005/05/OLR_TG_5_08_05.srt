00:00:29,616 --> 00:00:30,457

00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:36,661
[SPEAKER_02]: Say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

10
00:00:36,921 --> 00:00:38,862
[SPEAKER_03]: Yo, yo, yo, what up, my homies?

11
00:00:39,123 --> 00:00:39,563
[SPEAKER_03]: What up?

12
00:00:39,903 --> 00:00:40,523
[SPEAKER_02]: Girl, what up?

13
00:00:41,804 --> 00:00:43,966
[SPEAKER_03]: Ceiling, Sky, my cue.

14
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:47,652
[SPEAKER_02]: Not your voice tonight, you're not perky tonight.

15
00:00:48,032 --> 00:00:48,732
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi!

16
00:00:48,933 --> 00:00:49,813
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's much better.

17
00:00:49,833 --> 00:00:50,554
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god!

18
00:00:51,054 --> 00:00:54,717
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you're primed and ready for G4 now, thank you.

19
00:00:55,758 --> 00:00:57,159
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm not on enough drugs, thank you.

20
00:00:57,279 --> 00:00:59,140
[SPEAKER_02]: Say hello to Loki as well.

21
00:00:59,560 --> 00:00:59,861
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi.

22
00:01:00,321 --> 00:01:00,981
[SPEAKER_01]: How you doing, sir?

23
00:01:01,582 --> 00:01:04,444
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking for this... I'm trying to find this one game.

24
00:01:04,904 --> 00:01:08,027
[SPEAKER_01]: My friend at work was telling me about this crappy truck game.

25
00:01:08,067 --> 00:01:08,447
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like this

26
00:01:08,919 --> 00:01:10,220
[SPEAKER_01]: Diesel Truck Racing Game

27
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:28,251
[SPEAKER_01]: I know what you're talking about.

28
00:01:28,271 --> 00:01:29,152
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen it before somewhere.

29
00:01:29,192 --> 00:01:29,693
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to download it.

30
00:01:48,741 --> 00:01:50,242
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't actually want to buy it.

31
00:01:50,282 --> 00:01:50,902
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to download it.

32
00:01:50,982 --> 00:01:52,723
[SPEAKER_02]: I call that a Walmart game.

33
00:01:53,043 --> 00:02:02,447
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason why I call that a Walmart game is if you've ever been to Walmart, which I'm sure most people have if they have them in your area, if you go into the Walmart arcade, quote unquote, what do they always have?

34
00:02:02,787 --> 00:02:04,608
[SPEAKER_02]: They have the crane game that you can play.

35
00:02:05,148 --> 00:02:08,010
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they always have some type of hunting game.

36
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:08,710
[SPEAKER_02]: Deer Hunter.

37
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:09,170
[SPEAKER_02]: Deer Hunter.

38
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:11,992
[SPEAKER_02]: And then usually they'll have like an 18-wheeler game.

39
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:14,213
[SPEAKER_03]: But the Sega 18-wheeler game was good.

40
00:02:15,273 --> 00:02:16,914
[SPEAKER_02]: But Walmart doesn't have the Sega 18-wheeler game.

41
00:02:16,934 --> 00:02:17,434
[SPEAKER_02]: Because Walmart's...

42
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:21,503
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not big on Walmart, but we won't get into those reasons here on this program because we're going to talk about games.

43
00:02:40,819 --> 00:02:41,039
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

44
00:02:41,059 --> 00:02:43,221
[SPEAKER_03]: Ranma is my favorite store.

45
00:02:43,521 --> 00:02:45,183
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to read more about it, read my blog.

46
00:02:45,503 --> 00:02:45,783
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

47
00:02:46,504 --> 00:02:47,705
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about games.

48
00:02:48,426 --> 00:02:49,547
[SPEAKER_02]: And your games, actually.

49
00:02:49,567 --> 00:02:50,888
[SPEAKER_02]: The games that you've been playing this week.

50
00:02:51,408 --> 00:02:51,889
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.

51
00:02:52,649 --> 00:02:55,892
[SPEAKER_03]: I played Metal Slug X last night on the MAME with my man.

52
00:02:56,493 --> 00:02:56,993
[SPEAKER_03]: And we beat it.

53
00:02:57,033 --> 00:02:57,874
[SPEAKER_03]: The game's freaking hard.

54
00:02:57,914 --> 00:02:59,716
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's kind of cool walking around as a zombie.

55
00:03:00,656 --> 00:03:01,978
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, your mic was acting up there a little bit.

56
00:03:02,898 --> 00:03:03,359
[SPEAKER_02]: We got you, though.

57
00:03:03,379 --> 00:03:04,860
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I need to discipline it.

58
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:05,941
[SPEAKER_03]: Get me a ruler.

59
00:03:06,181 --> 00:03:06,922
[SPEAKER_03]: Smack that ass.

60
00:03:07,382 --> 00:03:08,043
[SPEAKER_01]: Wasn't it, mommy?

61
00:03:08,687 --> 00:03:10,949
[SPEAKER_03]: Metal Slug X Metal Slug X

62
00:03:33,174 --> 00:03:35,075
[SPEAKER_03]: and it still has all the Pole Position logos and all that.

63
00:03:35,095 --> 00:03:36,576
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll put pictures on it up on the web.

64
00:03:36,677 --> 00:03:37,057
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to.

65
00:03:37,077 --> 00:03:38,038
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be great.

66
00:03:38,198 --> 00:03:45,323
[SPEAKER_03]: But we played Metal Slug X last night and I'm hoping to convince them to play through some Space Harrier with me.

67
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:48,505
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you put infinite credits in Space Harrier and it's on.

68
00:03:48,545 --> 00:03:49,706
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that game lasts forever.

69
00:03:50,747 --> 00:03:51,807
[SPEAKER_03]: Or maybe some Blazing Star.

70
00:03:53,349 --> 00:03:53,849
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds like fun.

71
00:03:54,049 --> 00:03:55,210
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything else besides the retro?

72
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:57,452
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, widescreen Pong.

73
00:03:58,492 --> 00:03:58,812
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

74
00:03:59,473 --> 00:04:00,153
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, how about you?

75
00:04:00,534 --> 00:04:02,215
[SPEAKER_01]: Isn't it like scary that

76
00:04:02,885 --> 00:04:10,475
[SPEAKER_01]: 2 out of 3 people in this studio have a MAME cabinet in their... Rub it in a little more, why don't ya?

77
00:04:10,515 --> 00:04:11,877
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what we could do for you?

78
00:04:12,117 --> 00:04:16,983
[SPEAKER_03]: We could get you one of those mini Mac things.

79
00:04:17,644 --> 00:04:17,944
[SPEAKER_03]: You know? $500.

80
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:21,790
[SPEAKER_03]: Get you a cabinet that they're throwing away for $100.

81
00:04:22,151 --> 00:04:24,012
[SPEAKER_03]: We could build you a MAME for under $800.

82
00:04:24,432 --> 00:04:26,313
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, I live upstairs.

83
00:04:26,514 --> 00:04:27,134
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, dudette.

84
00:04:27,214 --> 00:04:28,155
[SPEAKER_02]: I live upstairs.

85
00:04:28,175 --> 00:04:28,995
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not hauling a MAME.

86
00:04:29,015 --> 00:04:30,596
[SPEAKER_03]: You can carry a gutted machine upstairs.

87
00:04:30,656 --> 00:04:31,377
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not that heavy.

88
00:04:31,757 --> 00:04:34,419
[SPEAKER_03]: We had two pole position machines in my living room.

89
00:04:34,499 --> 00:04:35,600
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all about Barcade.

90
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,342
[SPEAKER_02]: If I want to get the MAME cabinet in here, I'm going to have to get rid of your chair.

91
00:04:38,762 --> 00:04:38,882
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

92
00:04:40,147 --> 00:04:44,768
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, our next project is getting one of those cocktail machines, the table-looking ones.

93
00:04:44,989 --> 00:04:46,289
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that I would have in the house.

94
00:04:46,389 --> 00:04:51,170
[SPEAKER_02]: I would get rid of the kitchen table, even though it's my roommate's, and have the cocktail cabinet.

95
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:51,951
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be rock.

96
00:04:52,011 --> 00:04:54,131
[SPEAKER_03]: But we're planning on doing that as our next meme.

97
00:04:54,851 --> 00:04:55,191
[SPEAKER_03]: Sweet.

98
00:04:55,952 --> 00:04:57,272
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, Loki, your gaming week.

99
00:04:58,592 --> 00:05:05,655
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried Super Monkey Ball Deluxe for the PlayStation 2, and I'm here to say that it sucks ass.

100
00:05:07,035 --> 00:05:07,155
[SPEAKER_01]: It's

101
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:37,608
[SPEAKER_01]: Super Monkey Ball lends itself to make it look like oh yeah it's a cool kids game people might like it you go and play it and you're like what the fuck this sucks it's hard and it sucks I didn't like it and it was boring and I just didn't like it then I looked at I haven't really opened it up yet Area 51 the brand new game so maybe I'll play that I don't really know it's like all these first person shooters that are coming out nowadays it's really big whoop you know

102
00:05:38,052 --> 00:05:40,854
[SPEAKER_01]: Final Fantasy XI Final Fantasy XI Final Fantasy XI Final Fantasy XI

103
00:06:04,648 --> 00:06:13,052
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I waited for the last thing to die at the end of our chain, and I fake disconnected.

104
00:06:13,593 --> 00:06:13,953
[SPEAKER_01]: Lovely.

105
00:06:15,093 --> 00:06:17,134
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I don't know.

106
00:06:17,154 --> 00:06:18,555
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what I've been doing.

107
00:06:18,595 --> 00:06:21,897
[SPEAKER_01]: That and a lot of Ridge Racer for the PSP and Luminous.

108
00:06:21,957 --> 00:06:22,397
[SPEAKER_01]: Again?

109
00:06:22,997 --> 00:06:26,139
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been playing Ridge... I beat Pac-Man, finally.

110
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:29,141
[SPEAKER_01]: And I beat... What was it?

111
00:06:29,201 --> 00:06:29,721
[SPEAKER_01]: I still have the...

112
00:06:30,211 --> 00:06:32,011
[SPEAKER_01]: Beat the Angel car a little bit.

113
00:06:32,051 --> 00:06:34,472
[SPEAKER_01]: I played it a few times and it's still really hard.

114
00:06:34,892 --> 00:06:36,192
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't the Pac-Man car cool though?

115
00:06:36,692 --> 00:06:37,193
[SPEAKER_01]: Not really.

116
00:06:37,253 --> 00:06:39,833
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not as good as the one from Ridge Racer 4.

117
00:06:40,393 --> 00:06:43,094
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of Pac-Man, I have to get this off my chest before we get much further.

118
00:06:43,114 --> 00:06:44,974
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you know your Pac-Pix game came out this week?

119
00:06:45,374 --> 00:06:47,735
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, but that's not the one that I was really interested in.

120
00:06:48,135 --> 00:06:50,876
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I was listening to a previous podcast and you said something about the Pac-Pix game.

121
00:06:51,696 --> 00:06:54,777
[SPEAKER_03]: I want Pac-Pix, but I want the freaking Marble Madness looking one.

122
00:06:54,837 --> 00:06:55,737
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'll pack and roll.

123
00:06:55,857 --> 00:06:56,417
[SPEAKER_03]: Pack and roll.

124
00:06:57,838 --> 00:06:59,820
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, Loki, anything else?

125
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:02,541
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyways, yeah, just Ridge Racer and Luminous.

126
00:07:02,702 --> 00:07:05,543
[SPEAKER_01]: I unlocked two more skins today.

127
00:07:06,504 --> 00:07:13,909
[SPEAKER_01]: But as you know, really Luminous, it comes down to I don't have enough time to play it, so I can't really get that far in the game.

128
00:07:14,129 --> 00:07:17,051
[SPEAKER_01]: But, I don't know, Ridge Racer, I like it.

129
00:07:17,491 --> 00:07:21,294
[SPEAKER_01]: I was actually looking at maybe getting some more games coming out pretty soon.

130
00:07:21,314 --> 00:07:21,354
[SPEAKER_01]: Um...

131
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:28,001
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, they have, like, I don't really know what the hell it is with the PSP and the games coming out.

132
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:32,864
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, for example, you know, you have Metal Gear Solid and people are like, oh, yeah, Metal Gear Solid, awesome.

133
00:07:33,164 --> 00:07:34,885
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait, it's a card game, turn-based card game.

134
00:07:34,906 --> 00:07:35,526
[SPEAKER_01]: What the fuck?

135
00:07:35,626 --> 00:07:36,446
[SPEAKER_02]: Metal Gear Acid.

136
00:07:36,867 --> 00:07:39,328
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually plays more like one of those old-school strategy games.

137
00:07:39,348 --> 00:07:40,049
[SPEAKER_01]: What the hell is this?

138
00:07:40,529 --> 00:07:43,991
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you go, like, oh, Armored Core's coming out.

139
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:44,532
[SPEAKER_01]: Yay!

140
00:07:45,072 --> 00:07:46,173
[SPEAKER_01]: Mech Combat, yay!

141
00:07:47,053 --> 00:07:48,914
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I don't get to control them.

142
00:07:49,895 --> 00:07:50,235
[SPEAKER_01]: Boo.

143
00:07:50,675 --> 00:07:51,096
[SPEAKER_01]: That sucks.

144
00:07:51,116 --> 00:07:51,456
[SPEAKER_01]: That sucks.

145
00:07:52,039 --> 00:07:58,661
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I had games like that, or they actually had games for the PlayStation, you know, come out like that, and they sucked.

146
00:07:59,221 --> 00:08:01,621
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, where you had to create the AI for them and stuff.

147
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:02,521
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not fun.

148
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:04,942
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to play, you know, mech combat against each other.

149
00:08:04,962 --> 00:08:09,123
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to, like, oh, I'm going to program the coolest mech out there, blah, blah, blah.

150
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:13,304
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, so, before I ramble too much, you know, I was looking... Too late.

151
00:08:14,264 --> 00:08:14,704
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever.

152
00:08:14,724 --> 00:08:16,325
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, you know, I was looking at Mercury.

153
00:08:16,345 --> 00:08:21,666
[SPEAKER_01]: I might get that, but, you know, I'm waiting for Smart Bomb, which should be coming out pretty soon.

154
00:08:22,307 --> 00:08:23,467
[SPEAKER_03]: and I actually did play another game.

155
00:08:23,587 --> 00:08:23,867
[SPEAKER_01]: What else?

156
00:08:24,408 --> 00:08:27,669
[SPEAKER_03]: I played the Midway Collection and played Tempest on it.

157
00:08:28,869 --> 00:08:29,289
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait a minute.

158
00:08:29,369 --> 00:08:30,670
[SPEAKER_02]: Tempest isn't in the Midway Collection.

159
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:31,470
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't it?

160
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:32,030
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

161
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:34,191
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't Tempest... Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

162
00:08:34,211 --> 00:08:34,751
[SPEAKER_02]: The Atari one.

163
00:08:34,771 --> 00:08:35,111
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

164
00:08:35,151 --> 00:08:35,551
[SPEAKER_02]: Atari.

165
00:08:35,631 --> 00:08:38,072
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I played Tempest on it which was pretty cool.

166
00:08:38,332 --> 00:08:38,512
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.

167
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:40,493
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Tempest is awesome.

168
00:08:40,533 --> 00:08:42,374
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you just go back and forth just like with Trackball?

169
00:08:42,674 --> 00:08:44,315
[SPEAKER_02]: Tempest is awesome, but Tempest 2000 was better.

170
00:08:45,096 --> 00:08:46,837
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all about the music in Tempest 2000.

171
00:08:47,057 --> 00:08:47,497
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

172
00:08:47,717 --> 00:08:48,838
[SPEAKER_02]: Super Zapper Recharge.

173
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:49,939
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

174
00:08:49,999 --> 00:08:50,359
[SPEAKER_02]: What else?

175
00:08:50,719 --> 00:08:52,100
[SPEAKER_02]: What was my gaming week like?

176
00:08:53,661 --> 00:08:58,384
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I did one of these interesting things where I bought a game without actually having the console.

177
00:08:58,444 --> 00:08:59,705
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if any of you have ever done this.

178
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:04,588
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually bought a copy of Luminous this week, even though I personally don't own a PSP yet because I'm poor.

179
00:09:04,608 --> 00:09:05,449
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

180
00:09:06,149 --> 00:09:19,902
[SPEAKER_02]: My friend actually went and we were out and about the other night and he decided he wanted to get a PSP but he couldn't really afford because you know when you go to buy a game system, you buy the game system and then you buy the game and the memory card and whatever else comes with it.

181
00:09:19,962 --> 00:09:21,444
[SPEAKER_02]: So pretty soon you're making a pretty big investment.

182
00:09:21,484 --> 00:09:22,765
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't really get a PSP for $250.

183
00:09:23,246 --> 00:09:26,569
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to put in $350 if you want to get everything good with it.

184
00:09:27,037 --> 00:09:29,879
[SPEAKER_02]: So he decided he was going to buy it all, but he was only going to get one game.

185
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:31,160
[SPEAKER_02]: He decided to get Darkstalkers.

186
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:33,522
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, dude, you can't have a PSP and not have Luminous.

187
00:09:33,962 --> 00:09:35,423
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was like, you know what?

188
00:09:35,464 --> 00:09:36,284
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to buy Luminous.

189
00:09:36,364 --> 00:09:37,545
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to get a PSP soon enough.

190
00:09:37,765 --> 00:09:39,607
[SPEAKER_02]: So I bought Luminous like the sucker I am.

191
00:09:39,947 --> 00:09:40,868
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I let him borrow it.

192
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:47,593
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if any of you guys have ever done that before, but that's just crazy me, I guess.

193
00:09:48,013 --> 00:09:54,298
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I had money to burn, and I don't know why I would buy that and just not buy a PSP, but whatever.

194
00:09:54,318 --> 00:09:55,179
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a moment of weakness.

195
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:55,679
[SPEAKER_02]: What can I say?

196
00:09:55,984 --> 00:09:57,426
[SPEAKER_02]: But at least I have a copy of Luminous now.

197
00:09:59,267 --> 00:10:03,151
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, this week, I got to go to my very first video game premiere, which was kind of cool.

198
00:10:04,052 --> 00:10:13,883
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a party for Red Octane's In the Groove, which is kind of, it's very, very similar to Dance Dance Revolution, and in fact, if you are a member of the

199
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:15,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Music Gaming Community.

200
00:10:15,877 --> 00:10:18,899
[SPEAKER_02]: You probably have seen these debates going back and forth.

201
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:21,121
[SPEAKER_02]: Is In The Groove too much like DDR or what?

202
00:10:21,782 --> 00:10:26,645
[SPEAKER_02]: All those arguments aside, I had a really good time at the show, which took place in San Francisco.

203
00:10:27,386 --> 00:10:28,647
[SPEAKER_02]: They really know how to throw a party.

204
00:10:28,667 --> 00:10:29,187
[SPEAKER_02]: It was great.

205
00:10:29,287 --> 00:10:30,188
[SPEAKER_02]: Open bar and everything.

206
00:10:30,709 --> 00:10:32,150
[SPEAKER_02]: The game itself looks very smooth.

207
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:35,272
[SPEAKER_02]: It made a great transition from the arcade to the home version.

208
00:10:35,292 --> 00:10:37,774
[SPEAKER_02]: I was very impressed with the new dance pads that showed up as well.

209
00:10:38,334 --> 00:10:40,336
[SPEAKER_02]: Red Octane's new afterburner pad, awesome.

210
00:10:40,576 --> 00:10:41,957
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was pretty happy with that.

211
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:48,012
[SPEAKER_02]: So, if you are a fan of In the Groove, you're not going to be disappointed by the home release, what can I say?

212
00:10:48,632 --> 00:10:53,613
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was pretty much my gaming week, not a whole lot else outside of that that I haven't already been playing and talked about on a previous show.

213
00:10:54,614 --> 00:10:57,555
[SPEAKER_02]: So, why don't we get into some gaming news.

214
00:10:57,615 --> 00:11:06,317
[SPEAKER_02]: First off, since we were talking about the music games, and a lot of people know us because of our music and gaming affiliation that our 24-hour stream has over on Live365, we

215
00:11:09,051 --> 00:11:16,717
[SPEAKER_02]: There actually were some leaks this week that DDR Extreme 2 and Ultramix 3 are confirmed and going to be shown at E3 this year.

216
00:11:16,757 --> 00:11:26,964
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's pretty cool because Ultramix 3 has some interesting new modes in it, such as quest mode, where it sounds like you're going to have a story where you go around and meet other DDR characters.

217
00:11:27,885 --> 00:11:29,126
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of a first for a home release.

218
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:29,746
[SPEAKER_02]: Should be interesting.

219
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:33,249
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I've been actually asking for that.

220
00:11:33,309 --> 00:11:34,890
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think it'd be interesting.

221
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:35,190
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean,

222
00:11:37,145 --> 00:11:45,492
[SPEAKER_01]: How bad can it be?

223
00:11:46,353 --> 00:11:47,494
[SPEAKER_02]: Dance, Dance, Dance bad?

224
00:11:47,714 --> 00:11:48,055
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

225
00:11:48,075 --> 00:11:48,475
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

226
00:11:49,436 --> 00:11:51,158
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even remember Dance, Dance, Dance old.

227
00:11:51,998 --> 00:11:52,339
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

228
00:11:52,479 --> 00:12:00,526
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, Extreme 2, getting a lot of raised eyebrows because the article that was leaked on GamePro confirms that

229
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:04,239
[SPEAKER_02]: Genie in a Bottle, and Oops I Did It Again are going to be in it.

230
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:10,562
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of us hardcore music game fans are like, oh god, oh god no, oh god.

231
00:12:11,643 --> 00:12:22,028
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're kind of hoping that those are the only two really, really commercial songs in it to sell the game, and then the rest are going to be like cool new stuff, you know, from not well-known artists, you know.

232
00:12:22,418 --> 00:12:22,778
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

233
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:25,100
[SPEAKER_02]: Did they confirm that it was a purple interface?

234
00:12:25,941 --> 00:12:26,641
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we don't know yet.

235
00:12:26,661 --> 00:12:27,021
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know.

236
00:12:27,402 --> 00:12:28,483
[SPEAKER_02]: Inside joke.

237
00:12:28,783 --> 00:12:29,163
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

238
00:12:29,703 --> 00:12:35,328
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, Red Octane announcing not only are they publishing in the group, but they're going to do a new harmonics game later this year, Guitar Hero.

239
00:12:35,968 --> 00:12:39,351
[SPEAKER_02]: So now you can dance at home and you can play the guitar at home.

240
00:12:39,611 --> 00:12:40,171
[SPEAKER_02]: How cool is that?

241
00:12:41,192 --> 00:12:41,993
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can sing at home.

242
00:12:42,373 --> 00:12:46,456
[SPEAKER_02]: You can be a one-man band, dance, sing, and play the guitar, but not all at once.

243
00:12:46,576 --> 00:12:46,756
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly?

244
00:12:46,776 --> 00:12:47,957
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless you have multiple systems.

245
00:12:48,598 --> 00:12:49,939
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be pretty smart.

246
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:51,660
[SPEAKER_01]: No, honestly, think about this.

247
00:12:52,449 --> 00:13:05,957
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd be really cool, land-wise, to link these games together for, like, you know, kind of like they did with the arcade with Drum Mania and Guitar Freaks, to be able to land these, like, different games together or whatever and be able to play, like, a song.

248
00:13:05,977 --> 00:13:13,742
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, one person sings the lyrics, the other person plays the guitar, the other one, you know, does, you know, whatever, you know, a keyboard or something.

249
00:13:14,302 --> 00:13:15,043
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't they do that?

250
00:13:15,323 --> 00:13:16,323
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what they need to be doing.

251
00:13:17,324 --> 00:13:17,984
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't complain.

252
00:13:18,004 --> 00:13:18,645
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be kind of neat.

253
00:13:18,685 --> 00:13:19,746
[SPEAKER_02]: It's my idea, Pat and Penny.

254
00:13:20,506 --> 00:13:20,786
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

255
00:13:21,647 --> 00:13:21,747
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

256
00:13:22,697 --> 00:13:23,118
[SPEAKER_02]: Video Games Live

257
00:13:38,506 --> 00:13:44,090
[SPEAKER_02]: This is being put together by Tommy Talarco, who you guys might know from the television and other stuff.

258
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:45,751
[SPEAKER_02]: He's done music for games, right?

259
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:47,072
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, goody.

260
00:13:47,092 --> 00:13:47,112
[SPEAKER_02]: G4.

261
00:13:47,172 --> 00:13:47,432
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

262
00:13:47,852 --> 00:13:50,174
[SPEAKER_02]: And the Clear Channel Music Group are putting this thing together.

263
00:13:51,174 --> 00:13:58,159
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be starting off with a July 6th show at the Hollywood Bowl, and it'll go on some other venues announced in Denver and Boston.

264
00:13:58,579 --> 00:14:06,364
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll be doing some music, playing Halo, Metal Gear Solid music, and then, interestingly enough, they also mention...

265
00:14:06,784 --> 00:14:10,847
[SPEAKER_02]: Donkey Kong, and Pong Pong didn't have music, did it?

266
00:14:11,328 --> 00:14:26,859
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no idea what they mean by music from Pong but it's in there, so go figure Also interesting to note, Final Fantasy will have its music played even though Final Fantasy is doing their own concert so I don't know if they had the license or whatever they're doing They're being sneaky

267
00:14:27,426 --> 00:14:35,372
[SPEAKER_02]: But also, they're going to say, not only is it the orchestra playing the music, but choirs and laser shows and footage of games.

268
00:14:35,512 --> 00:14:36,773
[SPEAKER_02]: Freaking laser shows.

269
00:14:38,174 --> 00:14:40,516
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, goody, laser shows.

270
00:14:40,936 --> 00:14:45,980
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be like, you ever been to one of those shows where they play Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon to Wizard of Oz?

271
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:46,720
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

272
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:47,501
[SPEAKER_02]: Freaking lasers.

273
00:14:48,061 --> 00:14:50,223
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they ill-tempered video games?

274
00:14:53,211 --> 00:14:54,432
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, so that should be interesting.

275
00:14:54,552 --> 00:14:56,093
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you guys have any interest in checking this out?

276
00:14:56,273 --> 00:15:00,376
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I'm going to the Final Fantasy concert, as is Loki, the more friends.

277
00:15:00,576 --> 00:15:02,637
[SPEAKER_02]: Does this sound like something we ought to be getting tickets for, too?

278
00:15:03,518 --> 00:15:05,479
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm going to the art show, thank you.

279
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:09,742
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I'm going clubbing, and then I'm getting some chicken and waffles.

280
00:15:10,863 --> 00:15:13,204
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but this is something that's touring the country.

281
00:15:13,244 --> 00:15:14,105
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just E3.

282
00:15:14,585 --> 00:15:19,889
[SPEAKER_02]: So that being said, is it something... Hypothetically, if this came to San Francisco, would you go?

283
00:15:20,389 --> 00:15:20,509
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

284
00:15:20,829 --> 00:15:21,550
[SPEAKER_03]: If somebody drives me.

285
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:25,851
[SPEAKER_01]: I would not go because Tommy Talarco is attached to it.

286
00:15:26,251 --> 00:15:30,134
[SPEAKER_01]: Tommy Talarco for me is like Bobby Flay on the goddamn Food Network.

287
00:15:30,414 --> 00:15:33,837
[SPEAKER_01]: And for anyone that knows me, you know how much I hate Bobby Flay.

288
00:15:34,178 --> 00:15:39,062
[SPEAKER_01]: I will actually sit there and watch Bobby Flay's show and scowl at him the entire time.

289
00:15:39,422 --> 00:15:42,484
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though he can't see me through the TV, but I will do it anyways.

290
00:15:43,165 --> 00:15:46,428
[SPEAKER_01]: And I friggin' hate him because he's a little whiny bastard.

291
00:15:46,868 --> 00:15:47,529
[SPEAKER_01]: And guess what?

292
00:15:47,569 --> 00:15:50,231
[SPEAKER_01]: Tommy Talarco is a little whiny bastard just as well.

293
00:15:50,311 --> 00:15:51,612
[SPEAKER_01]: He is the Bobby Flay

294
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:53,816
[SPEAKER_01]: MTV Movie Awards

295
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:23,575
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, you might be thinking, what the heck do movie awards have to do with video games?

296
00:16:23,715 --> 00:16:27,878
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't know, it's just like, what the heck does music have to do with MTV anymore?

297
00:16:28,418 --> 00:16:29,078
[SPEAKER_02]: Good question.

298
00:16:29,479 --> 00:16:34,062
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, MTV Music Awards, I'm sorry, the Movie Awards will be adding a category.

299
00:16:34,602 --> 00:16:37,244
[SPEAKER_02]: Best Video Game Based on a Movie.

300
00:16:38,184 --> 00:16:39,065
[SPEAKER_02]: That is great.

301
00:16:39,885 --> 00:16:46,890
[SPEAKER_02]: The nominees for Best Video Game Based on a Movie, Spider-Man 2, Chronicles of Riddick, Escape from Butcher Bay,

302
00:16:47,523 --> 00:16:48,744
[SPEAKER_02]: Harry Potter and the Prisoner

303
00:17:09,807 --> 00:17:10,167
[SPEAKER_02]: Geeks.

304
00:17:10,447 --> 00:17:12,247
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolute Harry Potter geeks.

305
00:17:12,808 --> 00:17:14,308
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that that's bad, I'm just saying, they're geeks.

306
00:17:14,428 --> 00:17:19,309
[SPEAKER_03]: I only bought one Harry Potter game, and it was awful, but it seemed like it was based more off the book than off the movie.

307
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:21,289
[SPEAKER_01]: I was not a fan of the Quidditch game.

308
00:17:21,309 --> 00:17:23,949
[SPEAKER_01]: Why isn't Grand Theft Auto nominated?

309
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:27,010
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's best video game based on a movie.

310
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:31,931
[SPEAKER_02]: Vice City was based on Miami Vice, a TV show.

311
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:36,952
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it was based on Miami Vice, and it was also based on... Oh, God.

312
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:37,012
[SPEAKER_01]: Um...

313
00:17:40,222 --> 00:17:41,763
[SPEAKER_01]: Al Pacino movie.

314
00:17:41,863 --> 00:17:42,343
[SPEAKER_01]: Scarface?

315
00:17:42,543 --> 00:17:45,564
[SPEAKER_01]: Scarface, yeah, exactly.

316
00:17:45,664 --> 00:17:47,485
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, unfortunately, it's a little bit of a stretch.

317
00:17:47,805 --> 00:17:48,445
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, darn.

318
00:17:48,965 --> 00:17:52,987
[SPEAKER_02]: Thankfully, they didn't do best movie based on a video game.

319
00:17:53,387 --> 00:17:57,188
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe they were going to try and do it, but then they realized, gee, what came out this year?

320
00:17:58,029 --> 00:18:00,830
[SPEAKER_02]: Alone in the Dark, Resident Evil Apocalypse.

321
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:02,970
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the other one?

322
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:04,531
[SPEAKER_02]: Was there another one?

323
00:18:05,311 --> 00:18:06,492
[SPEAKER_02]: The island one, Alone in the Dark.

324
00:18:06,512 --> 00:18:07,112
[SPEAKER_01]: Alone in the Dark.

325
00:18:09,144 --> 00:18:12,345
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they thought, we really want to give an award to one of these crappy games?

326
00:18:12,365 --> 00:18:13,405
[SPEAKER_01]: Please do not.

327
00:18:13,705 --> 00:18:16,846
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to hear an award winning Alone in the Dark.

328
00:18:17,006 --> 00:18:18,146
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that would be horrible.

329
00:18:18,366 --> 00:18:18,586
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

330
00:18:18,866 --> 00:18:19,626
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we don't need that, man.

331
00:18:19,646 --> 00:18:20,727
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm making any more movies.

332
00:18:21,607 --> 00:18:26,288
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of movies, what do you think about this, Loki?

333
00:18:26,328 --> 00:18:29,349
[SPEAKER_02]: The PSP UMD format has been cracked.

334
00:18:30,169 --> 00:18:33,530
[SPEAKER_02]: You can now read the files off of the UMD disks for the PSP.

335
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:38,731
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is, let's see, coming off a story that actually Engadget ran.

336
00:18:39,626 --> 00:18:40,848
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, that they did this.

337
00:18:40,948 --> 00:18:42,890
[SPEAKER_02]: And now ISO's popping up all over the internet.

338
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:43,331
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think?

339
00:18:43,351 --> 00:18:44,912
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's three of them.

340
00:18:45,012 --> 00:18:47,776
[SPEAKER_01]: There's, um, Wipeout, the USA version.

341
00:18:47,856 --> 00:18:49,738
[SPEAKER_01]: There's Ridge Racer, the Japanese version.

342
00:18:49,758 --> 00:18:55,324
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's some other tower of some... Vampire Chronicles.

343
00:18:55,464 --> 00:18:56,506
[SPEAKER_01]: Vampire Chronicles, yeah.

344
00:18:57,507 --> 00:18:57,587
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh...

345
00:18:58,513 --> 00:19:00,555
[SPEAKER_01]: I already have the ISO for the white belt.

346
00:19:00,575 --> 00:19:01,816
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but what can you do with it?

347
00:19:01,856 --> 00:19:06,960
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the USDs are in those little case things and you can't really burn... It was kind of smart what Sony did there.

348
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,261
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet they did it just to combat piracy.

349
00:19:08,281 --> 00:19:10,082
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, here's what you can do with it, okay?

350
00:19:10,102 --> 00:19:11,403
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, okay.

351
00:19:11,443 --> 00:19:16,267
[SPEAKER_01]: You can take the files and try the reverse engineering, which is going to be close to impossible.

352
00:19:16,728 --> 00:19:23,353
[SPEAKER_01]: You can rip some of the, like... I'm sure some of the graphics from it, but that's really useless crap anyways, you know?

353
00:19:24,177 --> 00:19:33,661
[SPEAKER_01]: You can look at... There are individual files in there that... They're basically these files called ELF files or whatever.

354
00:19:35,161 --> 00:19:40,443
[SPEAKER_01]: They're basically like executables or whatever, and you can probably try to create something out of that.

355
00:19:40,663 --> 00:19:45,285
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, the whole reason I think that they ripped Wipeout is because they're looking for the web browser.

356
00:19:45,805 --> 00:19:46,806
[SPEAKER_02]: Wasn't ELF a band?

357
00:19:48,286 --> 00:19:48,706
[SPEAKER_01]: Forget it.

358
00:19:49,066 --> 00:19:51,207
[SPEAKER_03]: That was ELO, Electric Light Orchestra.

359
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:53,188
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I'm thinking EMF.

360
00:19:53,868 --> 00:19:54,268
[SPEAKER_01]: Nevermind.

361
00:19:54,468 --> 00:19:54,888
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever.

362
00:19:55,108 --> 00:19:55,468
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways.

363
00:19:55,969 --> 00:19:58,109
[SPEAKER_01]: But, this is just a step.

364
00:19:58,209 --> 00:20:19,634
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, because later on this week, actually, or last week, I should say, right after this story came out, they actually announced that they had run code on the Japanese PSP, the version 1.0, because all the US ones are shipped version 1.5, where the whole is covered.

365
00:20:19,714 --> 00:20:22,435
[SPEAKER_01]: But basically, this guy who actually has one of the...

366
00:20:24,737 --> 00:20:33,321
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the development kits, he created his own Hello World program and it runs off of a memory card.

367
00:20:35,742 --> 00:20:37,342
[SPEAKER_02]: Any other interesting hack stories going on?

368
00:20:39,103 --> 00:20:41,284
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, the Nintendo DS.

369
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:50,527
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been saying it, and there's actually the joke out there about installing Linux on Dead Badger, but now it's Linux for the DS.

370
00:20:51,048 --> 00:20:51,888
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.

371
00:20:52,288 --> 00:20:53,609
[SPEAKER_01]: They have successfully...

372
00:20:55,063 --> 00:21:00,185
[SPEAKER_01]: Booted a kernel on there, and for those who don't know, that's like the operating system type thing.

373
00:21:00,605 --> 00:21:07,669
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're actually running this shell called Sash, and simple text games are on there.

374
00:21:07,749 --> 00:21:13,411
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, all those old, like, you know, things, Zork or whatever, you know, that type of thing.

375
00:21:14,452 --> 00:21:18,153
[SPEAKER_01]: But, yeah, there's information on that on themodgods.com.

376
00:21:18,193 --> 00:21:19,714
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a whole thing on it, and...

377
00:21:20,373 --> 00:21:21,834
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really follow the Linux thing.

378
00:21:21,995 --> 00:21:26,098
[SPEAKER_02]: That would only be cool if Zork was one of the text games that they ported.

379
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:29,301
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I might consider... They have Zork as a 404 message.

380
00:21:30,823 --> 00:21:31,844
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, but anyways.

381
00:21:31,864 --> 00:21:34,106
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's what's going on there.

382
00:21:34,406 --> 00:21:45,116
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it'll be cool just because you can do an actual soft keyboard on there using the touchscreen versus trying to type on the...

383
00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:47,580
[SPEAKER_01]: PSP is just crap.

384
00:22:14,787 --> 00:22:16,288
[SPEAKER_02]: Only one game cart needed.

385
00:22:16,848 --> 00:22:17,588
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of neat.

386
00:22:18,509 --> 00:22:28,574
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there are eight players, they'll actually use both DS screens during the game to kind of spread things out a little bit because it might get kind of crowded with eight people on one screen.

387
00:22:29,094 --> 00:22:32,195
[SPEAKER_02]: So it should be interesting.

388
00:22:32,395 --> 00:22:35,237
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully it can restore my faith in the DS a little bit.

389
00:22:35,277 --> 00:22:35,617
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

390
00:22:35,897 --> 00:22:39,519
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's anywhere near as cool as Super Bomberman 2 was, I'll have it.

391
00:22:40,139 --> 00:22:41,860
[SPEAKER_02]: June 21st is the date we'll find out.

392
00:22:43,911 --> 00:23:01,359
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's go ahead and let DarkSakura present her advice column because, you know, we here at Orange Lounge Radio, we're not just here to talk about games, but we're also here to better your life because if we talked about video games all the time, we'd have no time to go out and get our hair did.

393
00:23:01,759 --> 00:23:04,821
[SPEAKER_02]: So, DarkSakura, it's your turn to give us your advice column.

394
00:23:05,101 --> 00:23:07,562
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you going to talk to us about tonight, my friend?

395
00:23:08,615 --> 00:23:11,137
[SPEAKER_03]: Today's advice is how to treat a severed limb.

396
00:23:12,278 --> 00:23:17,422
[SPEAKER_03]: Number one, locate any individual bleeding arteries on the stump.

397
00:23:17,922 --> 00:23:19,723
[SPEAKER_03]: Two, pinch off the large arteries.

398
00:23:20,504 --> 00:23:22,025
[SPEAKER_03]: Three, apply a tourniquet.

399
00:23:22,425 --> 00:23:28,610
[SPEAKER_03]: Choose a strip of material at least an inch wide, tie it around the stump as close to the end as possible so it will not fall off when tightened.

400
00:23:29,251 --> 00:23:32,293
[SPEAKER_03]: Tie it moderately tight, tighten just enough to stop most of the bleeding.

401
00:23:32,393 --> 00:23:33,474
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep pinching the arteries.

402
00:23:34,535 --> 00:23:37,517
[SPEAKER_03]: Four, tie off the ends of any blood vessels being pinched.

403
00:23:38,098 --> 00:23:43,519
[SPEAKER_03]: Use fishing line, dental floss, or heavy thread and a sewing needle if available to carefully tie off arteries.

404
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:43,519
5.

405
00:23:44,459 --> 00:23:45,539
[SPEAKER_03]: Clean the stump thoroughly.

406
00:23:46,539 --> 00:23:45,539
6.

407
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:47,720
[SPEAKER_03]: Loosen the tourniquet.

408
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,720
[SPEAKER_03]: As pressure from the tourniquet decreases, check your ties.

409
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:53,481
[SPEAKER_03]: If bleeding is just moderate, you can remove the tourniquet.

410
00:23:53,901 --> 00:23:58,261
[SPEAKER_03]: In order to preserve tissue at the stump, do not leave a tourniquet applied for more than 90 minutes.

411
00:23:59,122 --> 00:23:58,261
7.

412
00:23:59,442 --> 00:24:00,202
[SPEAKER_03]: Dress the stump.

413
00:24:00,662 --> 00:24:05,023
[SPEAKER_03]: Tightly cover the end of the stump with clean cloth or gauze.

414
00:24:05,683 --> 00:24:07,343
[SPEAKER_03]: Now my final advice though... Yes?

415
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:10,310
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop playing with those branch cutters.

416
00:24:14,793 --> 00:24:16,334
[SPEAKER_02]: Clean the stump thoroughly.

417
00:24:17,134 --> 00:24:21,056
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, you don't want any, you know, axe shavings on it or something.

418
00:24:21,276 --> 00:24:21,416
[SPEAKER_02]: Ew.

419
00:24:21,837 --> 00:24:23,057
[SPEAKER_03]: Or chainsaw oil.

420
00:24:24,878 --> 00:24:28,580
[SPEAKER_02]: Ew, now I'm thinking about the end of Fargo, and I'm getting all grossed.

421
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:32,923
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never seen that, but, you know, they had on a... Well, I just wrote it for you, but it's all right.

422
00:24:32,943 --> 00:24:33,863
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I'll ever see it.

423
00:24:34,243 --> 00:24:36,985
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, they had on the Darwin Awards.

424
00:24:37,711 --> 00:24:43,098
[SPEAKER_03]: There was two guys, brothers, and they had this bright idea that one would cut off the other's leg with a chainsaw.

425
00:24:43,158 --> 00:24:43,839
[SPEAKER_03]: Hilarious!

426
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:45,061
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, of course he died.

427
00:24:46,563 --> 00:24:49,466
[SPEAKER_02]: But if he had heard your advice, maybe he wouldn't have died.

428
00:24:50,648 --> 00:24:51,369
[SPEAKER_03]: Nah, I doubt it.

429
00:24:51,409 --> 00:24:55,895
[SPEAKER_03]: He cut through a major artery in the leg, and that's one of the ones that's like cutting one in your neck.

430
00:24:57,062 --> 00:24:59,183
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just trying to promote your column over here.

431
00:24:59,243 --> 00:25:01,804
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, but I still don't like stupid people to breed.

432
00:25:02,585 --> 00:25:04,986
[SPEAKER_02]: Really, your column will do no good for stupid people.

433
00:25:05,406 --> 00:25:08,627
[SPEAKER_03]: This is how to preserve the lives of intelligent people.

434
00:25:10,168 --> 00:25:13,029
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about another big story that was going on in the gaming world.

435
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:17,452
[SPEAKER_02]: Namco has merged with Bandai.

436
00:25:17,592 --> 00:25:21,433
[SPEAKER_02]: Bandai has bought Japanese developer and publisher Namco.

437
00:25:22,234 --> 00:25:22,954
[SPEAKER_02]: Very interesting.

438
00:25:23,034 --> 00:25:24,755
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be named the new company

439
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:50,443
[SPEAKER_02]: Namco Bandai Holdings and it is official as of September 29th 2005 and I believe this makes them the third largest don't quote me on that third largest gaming company well you know this also means that means that what we get out of this is a new Dragon Ball Z game with the Tekken 5 engine be interesting but I don't know I always thought maybe this is me personally maybe I'm just not

440
00:25:50,956 --> 00:25:54,338
[SPEAKER_02]: Giving enough respect to Bandai, but I always kind of preferred what Namco put out.

441
00:25:54,378 --> 00:25:57,879
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm a little sad that Bandai bought Namco and not the other way around.

442
00:25:57,979 --> 00:26:00,280
[SPEAKER_03]: If you play imports, though, it's all about Bandai.

443
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:03,102
[SPEAKER_03]: They put out all the DBZ games.

444
00:26:03,662 --> 00:26:08,204
[SPEAKER_03]: Bon Presto put out this game that it's a lot like Guardian Heroes.

445
00:26:09,685 --> 00:26:12,606
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe that's what it is, because I play some imports, but I don't play a lot.

446
00:26:12,686 --> 00:26:13,426
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what this means?

447
00:26:14,767 --> 00:26:19,089
[SPEAKER_01]: That in the next Tekken game, you might have a hidden character that is Hello Kitty.

448
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:21,021
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true.

449
00:26:21,301 --> 00:26:23,786
[SPEAKER_03]: You may have Goku in Tekken.

450
00:26:24,427 --> 00:26:28,295
[SPEAKER_03]: If we could have Gon in Tekken 3, just think about it.

451
00:26:28,315 --> 00:26:29,617
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to hold my breath for help.

452
00:26:29,637 --> 00:26:30,639
[SPEAKER_02]: That's Maru in Tekken 5.

453
00:26:30,719 --> 00:26:30,820
[SPEAKER_02]: That

454
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,121
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello Kitty Fighting Game.

455
00:26:35,162 --> 00:26:37,223
[SPEAKER_02]: The concept kind of scares me a little.

456
00:26:37,383 --> 00:26:38,464
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it would be awesome.

457
00:26:38,484 --> 00:26:39,845
[SPEAKER_01]: They really need to do that.

458
00:26:39,865 --> 00:26:41,326
[SPEAKER_01]: It would just be cool.

459
00:26:41,547 --> 00:26:44,989
[SPEAKER_01]: I choose Twinkle Twinkle Twinkle Twin Stars.

460
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:50,554
[SPEAKER_01]: No, what would be great is to do the Hello Kitty Fighting Game and make it as violent as like Tekken 5 or something.

461
00:26:51,054 --> 00:26:55,078
[SPEAKER_02]: The Twin Stars would be about as effective as the Ice Climbers in Smash Bros.

462
00:26:55,118 --> 00:26:57,800
[SPEAKER_02]: Melee and everybody hates playing the Ice Climbers.

463
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,541
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know anybody that enjoys playing the Ice Climbers.

464
00:26:59,561 --> 00:26:59,681
[SPEAKER_02]: No way.

465
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:01,763
[SPEAKER_03]: Dan plays the Ice Climbers and he's awesome with them.

466
00:27:01,923 --> 00:27:05,805
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, he's a freak of nature or something because nobody's good with the ice climbers.

467
00:27:05,905 --> 00:27:07,746
[SPEAKER_03]: We have ice climbers on our nest.

468
00:27:08,987 --> 00:27:09,987
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, dude, that game was awesome.

469
00:27:10,027 --> 00:27:10,468
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't get me wrong.

470
00:27:10,788 --> 00:27:11,028
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

471
00:27:12,529 --> 00:27:24,735
[SPEAKER_02]: If you guys have any feedback on our show, you want to write us and tell us that you are an ice climbers player, I don't know, send us an email, togo, T-O-G-O, at orangeloungeradio.com, and we might read some of your letters on the show.

472
00:27:25,154 --> 00:27:32,703
[SPEAKER_02]: Now one thing that we have been getting in the mailbox is that we have been getting a lot of response from folks overseas actually.

473
00:27:33,003 --> 00:27:33,664
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes we have.

474
00:27:35,085 --> 00:27:41,613
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually as a result now we're going to start covering a little bit more of the UK Europe news for them.

475
00:27:42,921 --> 00:27:43,941
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's start it off.

476
00:27:44,361 --> 00:27:47,762
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, you have agreed to kind of head up the UK scene.

477
00:27:47,782 --> 00:27:49,403
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's going on for our friends overseas?

478
00:27:49,523 --> 00:27:58,625
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, first and foremost, because I know there's been an issue of debate because for a while there was one thing being said by Sony and Amazon had a different date for the release dates of the PSP.

479
00:27:59,065 --> 00:28:01,506
[SPEAKER_03]: Now both of them are completely in sync.

480
00:28:01,886 --> 00:28:04,087
[SPEAKER_03]: The PSP will be available for £179 on 1st of September.

481
00:28:09,189 --> 00:28:24,498
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be a value pack that consists of the system, a pouch, 32MB memory stick, duo, a battery pack, headphones with remote control, AC adapter, wrist strap, cloth, and a sampler disc.

482
00:28:24,818 --> 00:28:33,182
[SPEAKER_03]: You can also go to yrpsp.com and order a copy of Spider-Man 2 that will be shipped to you for free.

483
00:28:33,202 --> 00:28:35,664
[SPEAKER_02]: That's an interesting way of doing it.

484
00:28:35,764 --> 00:28:35,964
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

485
00:28:36,508 --> 00:28:38,771
[SPEAKER_03]: Amazon UK is taking pre-orders at £179.

486
00:28:38,891 --> 00:28:40,534
[SPEAKER_03]: I also do have a few release dates for GameCube.

487
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:53,734
[SPEAKER_03]: This month, coming up on the 20th, we have Fairly OddParents Shadow Showdown, an Animaniacs game with an announced date.

488
00:28:53,834 --> 00:28:55,435
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, they're still making Animaniacs games?

489
00:28:55,495 --> 00:28:55,976
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know that.

490
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:57,316
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why.

491
00:28:57,477 --> 00:28:58,497
[SPEAKER_01]: No one watches that anymore.

492
00:28:58,517 --> 00:29:01,259
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it even on TV anymore?

493
00:29:01,659 --> 00:29:02,320
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

494
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:03,080
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, yeah.

495
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,421
[SPEAKER_01]: It must be big in Britain.

496
00:29:04,501 --> 00:29:05,782
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:18,321
[SPEAKER_01]: This game has a mini-game where you take the woman's nipples and they're actually the analog controls and you can play around with that.

510
00:30:18,801 --> 00:30:19,722
[SPEAKER_01]: It's awesome.

511
00:30:20,582 --> 00:30:21,502

528
00:30:53,206 --> 00:30:55,408
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, see, this is the nice thing for you folks overseas.

529
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:56,989
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, you know, whereas for us in...

530
00:30:58,290 --> 00:31:01,851
[SPEAKER_02]: Here in America, it's kind of interesting to hear the delay of games.

531
00:31:01,931 --> 00:31:09,014
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, sometimes we bitch and complain about how long games take to come over from Japan, but man, you're in Britain, you've got to wait for the PAL translation and everything.

532
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:09,574
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes forever.

533
00:31:10,735 --> 00:31:17,997
[SPEAKER_02]: So we kind of get to hear about that, but it's kind of interesting if you're on the other side of it and you're in Britain listening to this, we can already tell you which games suck, so just skip them.

534
00:31:18,117 --> 00:31:20,038
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm telling you, don't buy Polarium.

535
00:31:20,278 --> 00:31:20,558
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't.

572
00:33:29,282 --> 00:33:38,189
[SPEAKER_03]: So, hey, if we can distract a gamer from the games just for long enough, that totally is awesome.

00:33:38,389 --> 00:33:38,649
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, great.

574
00:33:38,669 --> 00:33:39,490

[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

585
00:34:44,985 --> 00:34:47,147
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we'll see what happens with that.

586
00:34:47,227 --> 00:34:48,268
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, and guess what?

587
00:34:48,548 --> 00:34:52,071
[SPEAKER_01]: They came up with a brand new original idea for a webcam.

588
00:34:53,172 --> 00:34:54,533
[SPEAKER_01]: My ad is very ugly.

589
00:34:55,273 --> 00:34:58,336
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, their brand new controller, um,

590
00:34:58,993 --> 00:35:00,574
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that'd be kind of weird.

591
00:35:00,614 --> 00:35:00,894
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

592
00:35:15,219 --> 00:35:15,799
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

593
00:35:15,819 --> 00:35:15,879
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.

594
00:35:45,504 --> 00:35:47,209
[SPEAKER_03]: It's ridiculous.

595
00:35:47,991 --> 00:35:54,328
[SPEAKER_03]: All this is is another example of parents not doing their damn jobs and expecting the government to do it for them.

596
00:35:55,417 --> 00:35:58,438
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the only reason this is going to pass is because they're lazy asses.

597
00:35:58,458 --> 00:36:00,619
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why we have censorship.

598
00:36:00,639 --> 00:36:03,920
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why the FCC is as rampant as it is these days.

599
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:07,861
[SPEAKER_03]: It's because they do not want to take responsibility.

600
00:36:08,041 --> 00:36:17,084
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're going to breed a child, they need to make you sign a fucking contract that says, I am going to raise my child and have some type of control over what they do.

601
00:36:18,284 --> 00:36:19,665
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what being a parent is.

602
00:36:19,765 --> 00:36:22,025
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not about lobbying the government to do it for you.

603
00:36:22,366 --> 00:36:23,606
[SPEAKER_03]: That's called being fucking lazy.

604
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:46,913
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have a, I don't know, I'm like, I totally see that point of it, and I'm not saying this is something that, like, needs to happen, but it's kind of one of those things where it's like, it doesn't totally bug me because, you know, we shouldn't sell violent video games to minors, but why do, it's, yeah, I think you're right where the parents have to really have a more active role in what their minors are buying, really.

605
00:36:48,927 --> 00:36:58,435
[SPEAKER_03]: I think having the rating system is good because then you're giving them a way to understand what type of game it is that they're purchasing for their child.

606
00:36:58,455 --> 00:37:01,017
[SPEAKER_02]: But I find it very interesting that they will pass a law for this.

607
00:37:01,117 --> 00:37:16,689
[SPEAKER_02]: However, they've never passed a law that says a movie theater must make sure that there is a child 17 or when a child 17 or younger is coming in that there is a guardian with them or they will be arrested because that crap happens all the time where kids get into R-rated movies.

608
00:37:17,582 --> 00:37:18,923
[SPEAKER_02]: Why are you picking on the video game industry?

609
00:37:18,983 --> 00:37:19,283
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

610
00:37:19,723 --> 00:37:23,525
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe there is a law on the books, but you and I know nobody enforces that law.

611
00:37:23,765 --> 00:37:25,686
[SPEAKER_02]: When we were kids, we got narrated movies all the time.

612
00:37:26,306 --> 00:37:34,190
[SPEAKER_03]: But the thing is, and this actually is directly affecting my life, because my fiance manages a GameStop.

613
00:37:35,691 --> 00:37:46,416
[SPEAKER_03]: What if some kid comes in and one of his employees sells the game and then it gets back to GameStop corporate when their parent raises a big fit on it and they fire him as the manager?

614
00:37:47,529 --> 00:37:52,994
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's just... You know, this is just more of a case of people sticking their nose where it doesn't belong.

615
00:37:53,495 --> 00:37:57,899
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if you want to stick your nose somewhere, shove it right back up your ass where it's been for the last 50 years.

616
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:00,542
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a very passionate subject for you.

617
00:38:01,403 --> 00:38:01,763
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

618
00:38:02,704 --> 00:38:04,265
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll probably get some emails on that one.

619
00:38:04,305 --> 00:38:04,686
[SPEAKER_02]: Good job.

620
00:38:04,746 --> 00:38:05,046
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

621
00:38:05,226 --> 00:38:07,068
[SPEAKER_03]: I welcome emails on that, okay?

622
00:38:07,248 --> 00:38:08,690
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, just... I want...

623
00:38:09,272 --> 00:38:10,653
[SPEAKER_03]: to hear from your parents.

624
00:38:11,113 --> 00:38:15,114
[SPEAKER_03]: And I will tell them exactly how I feel and why they're being retards.

625
00:38:15,374 --> 00:38:16,695
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy Mother's Day, by the way.

626
00:38:16,995 --> 00:38:18,175
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, happy Mother's Day.

627
00:38:19,296 --> 00:38:19,536
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

628
00:38:20,956 --> 00:38:24,318
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's move on to just a couple of last stories here.

629
00:38:24,458 --> 00:38:27,019
[SPEAKER_02]: EverQuest 2 is expanding.

630
00:38:27,039 --> 00:38:31,300
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a brand new expansion pack coming out called Desert of Flames.

631
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:35,862
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, 40 new creatures, 12 new zones, and you can advance to level 60.

632
00:38:36,778 --> 00:38:37,398
[SPEAKER_02]: and DarkSakura.

633
00:39:07,066 --> 00:39:07,406
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura

634
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:32,262
[SPEAKER_02]: We've talked about import gaming, especially on our live three-hour program that we have Sunday nights over on OrangeLawsRadio.com.

635
00:39:33,183 --> 00:39:39,925
[SPEAKER_02]: We've talked about places where you should buy import games and places where you should not buy import games because we're into import gaming.

636
00:39:40,425 --> 00:39:43,387
[SPEAKER_02]: What types of sites on the Internet would you recommend?

637
00:39:43,727 --> 00:39:46,248
[SPEAKER_02]: And keep in mind we're not being sponsored by anybody.

638
00:39:46,288 --> 00:39:47,468
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just personal opinion.

639
00:39:48,809 --> 00:39:49,709
[SPEAKER_02]: What sites would you recommend?

640
00:39:50,057 --> 00:39:52,960
[SPEAKER_03]: and NCSX, first and foremost, Japan Video Games.

641
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:55,062
[SPEAKER_03]: PlayAsia's been decent to me.

642
00:39:55,122 --> 00:39:57,083
[SPEAKER_03]: I do know people who've had problems with them.

643
00:39:58,104 --> 00:40:00,286
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually have had good experience with Lixang, too.

644
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:05,030
[SPEAKER_03]: But NCSX just sits at the top of them, of all of them.

645
00:40:05,431 --> 00:40:07,953
[SPEAKER_03]: Japan Video Games is another pretty good one.

646
00:40:07,973 --> 00:40:11,256
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where I ordered my Beatmania 2, my Drumania.

647
00:40:11,376 --> 00:40:14,759
[SPEAKER_02]: They're the only import company I've bought from, actually, and I don't have any complaints.

648
00:40:14,779 --> 00:40:15,079
[SPEAKER_02]: They're good.

649
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:15,460
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

650
00:40:16,021 --> 00:40:22,745
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, but if you say there was one that you would never recommend to anybody and you would say, forget it, don't ever do this, what would you say?

651
00:40:22,985 --> 00:40:23,365
[SPEAKER_02]: Buy right.

652
00:40:23,686 --> 00:40:24,006
[SPEAKER_02]: And why?

653
00:40:25,346 --> 00:40:29,009
[SPEAKER_03]: They have stolen money from me, not delivered promised product.

654
00:40:30,069 --> 00:40:33,451
[SPEAKER_03]: I ordered, and I specified, Japanese Tekken 4.

655
00:40:33,972 --> 00:40:38,454
[SPEAKER_03]: They sent me the Asian release, and then when I emailed them, it says, we didn't make any such promise.

656
00:40:38,854 --> 00:40:39,735
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, guess what?

657
00:40:40,575 --> 00:40:51,058
[SPEAKER_02]: The Better Business Bureau and the North Carolina Attorney General's Office have taken action against Buy Right Video Games and they have closed their doors and ceased operations as a result.

658
00:40:51,398 --> 00:40:51,958
[SPEAKER_02]: Woo-hoo!

659
00:40:52,818 --> 00:40:58,280
[SPEAKER_02]: Buy Right Video Games, of course, sold used antique and imported games and they were doing refurbished systems and stuff.

660
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:04,301
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's interesting because if you check out the website fatwallet.com, a bunch of people were just complaining about this.

661
00:41:04,341 --> 00:41:09,943
[SPEAKER_02]: They've been complaining about just what Jamie said there, bad service, misrepresenting themselves, and stealing your money.

662
00:41:10,905 --> 00:41:15,509
[SPEAKER_02]: So one quote said that they ordered a Saturn and it was cracked.

663
00:41:15,829 --> 00:41:17,070
[SPEAKER_02]: Soul Calibur didn't work.

664
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:18,051
[SPEAKER_02]: Crazy.

665
00:41:19,272 --> 00:41:20,753
[SPEAKER_02]: Better Business Bureau says this.

666
00:41:21,233 --> 00:41:29,480
[SPEAKER_02]: Based on BBB files, this company has an unsatisfactory record due to unanswered complaints concerning delivery problems and product dissatisfaction.

667
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:34,744
[SPEAKER_02]: The Bureau has processed 414 complaints about this company in the last 36 months.

668
00:41:35,024 --> 00:41:35,725
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you one of those?

669
00:41:36,403 --> 00:41:37,504
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

670
00:41:37,784 --> 00:41:40,346
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I actually never got my thing to the Better Business Bureau.

671
00:41:40,746 --> 00:41:42,087
[SPEAKER_03]: I have the letter prepared.

672
00:41:43,268 --> 00:41:49,932
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm actually hoping that they are doing a class action lawsuit because I'm going to get in on that.

673
00:41:51,093 --> 00:41:52,454
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this is interesting, too, is that

674
00:41:53,276 --> 00:42:07,327
[SPEAKER_02]: On April 12th, the North Carolina Attorney General's Office told Buy Right Video Games basically to request that they do not take orders, inform customers of the business status, and they have to provide a telephone number for customers to contact them in case of complaints.

675
00:42:07,748 --> 00:42:08,468
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, guess what?

676
00:42:08,989 --> 00:42:12,351
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't comply because as of April 26th, they shut them down.

677
00:42:12,912 --> 00:42:13,172
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.

678
00:42:13,632 --> 00:42:14,032
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

679
00:42:14,132 --> 00:42:15,694
[SPEAKER_02]: So we say, good riddance.

680
00:42:15,994 --> 00:42:17,275
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to email them and gloat.

681
00:42:19,753 --> 00:42:21,734
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's going to do it for another podcast.

682
00:42:21,774 --> 00:42:25,615
[SPEAKER_02]: Any parting words from Loki over there, who's been kind of quiet this last bit of show?

683
00:42:25,755 --> 00:42:29,896
[SPEAKER_01]: What was the thing about the two guys that were making movies?

684
00:42:30,076 --> 00:42:32,997
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I ended up skipping that because we were running long, but I'll mention it real quick.

685
00:42:33,037 --> 00:42:36,259
[SPEAKER_02]: Clive Barker, John Woo, getting together to do this project.

686
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:37,339
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called Demonic.

687
00:42:37,859 --> 00:42:43,361
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically what it is, they're going to be simultaneously doing a next-gen console game and film.

688
00:42:43,851 --> 00:42:44,251
[SPEAKER_02]: Silent Hill Movie

689
00:43:13,459 --> 00:43:13,939
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fine.

690
00:43:14,039 --> 00:43:14,259
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

691
00:43:14,299 --> 00:43:14,719
[SPEAKER_02]: Parting words?

692
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:16,920
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hot in here.

693
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:18,321
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

694
00:43:18,421 --> 00:43:18,921
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura?

695
00:43:20,762 --> 00:43:21,642
[SPEAKER_03]: Reject false icons.

696
00:43:22,142 --> 00:43:26,964
[SPEAKER_02]: And my parting words are visit the website, orangelaunchradio.com, and subscribe to the podcast.
