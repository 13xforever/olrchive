00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,260
Yo, yo, yo, what up my homies?

10
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:41,480

11
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:45,840
Ceiling, Sky, my cue.

12
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,920
Not your voice tonight, you're not perky tonight.

13
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:48,920
Hi!

14
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:49,920
Aw, that's much better.

15
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,920
Oh my God!

16
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:55,120
Aw, you're primed and ready for G4 now, thank you.

17
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,360
No, I'm not on enough drugs, thank you.

18
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,440
Say hello to Loki as well.

19
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,440
Hi. How you doing, sir?

20
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,940
I'm looking for this...

21
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:04,440
I'm trying to find this one game.

22
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,940
My friend at work was telling me about this crappy truck game.

23
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:11,940
It's like this diesel truck racing game that's for the PC.

24
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:13,940
Badass Mother Truckers? Is that it?

25
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:18,440
No, it's not one of the main ones you would know.

26
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,940
18 Wheeler Madness.

27
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:21,940
It's not 18 Wheeler Madness or anything like that.

28
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:23,940
But apparently the physics in the game suck.

29
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:27,940
Like, for example, the truck you race against doesn't move at all

30
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:33,340
So you automatically win no matter what your acceleration. There's no cap to it

31
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:38,300
So eventually you'll start going like an infinite amount of speed. I've heard of this game yet

32
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:42,300
I have no I mean I didn't like say oh I should remember this game

33
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:46,320
So I didn't you know memorize the name, but I know what you're talking about. I've seen it before somewhere

34
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,320
I want to download it

35
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,120
I don't actually want to buy it

36
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:55,540
I call that a Walmart game and the reason why I call that a Walmart game is if you've ever been to Walmart

37
00:01:55,540 --> 00:02:00,480
Which I'm sure you know most people have if they have them in your area if you go into the Walmart arcade

38
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,640
Quote-unquote, what do they always have they have the crane game that you can play and then they always have

39
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:11,840
Excuse me some type of hunting game here and deer hunter and then usually they'll have like an 18-wheeler game

40
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,060
But the Sega 18-wheeler game was good

41
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,880
But Walmart doesn't have the Sega 18-wheeler game

42
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,180
Yeah, you know we don't have Kmart anymore to call them the ghetto so we have Walmart now

43
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:26,980
I guess well there there are Kmart still around. It's just you know Kmart. I actually like

44
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:31,420
Walmart except I only like Walmart in the south where they have Super Walmart

45
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,700
You can buy your groceries for half the cost of the grocery store

46
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:39,300
I'm I'm not big on Walmart, but we won't get into those reasons here on this program because we're gonna talk about games

47
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:45,720
Sorry, well my is my favorite store you you want to read more about it read my blog whatever

48
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:51,860
Let's talk about games and your games actually the games that you've been playing this week dark Sakura

49
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:56,980
I played Metal Slug X last night on the maim with my man, and we beat it

50
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:59,500
I think it's freaking hard, but it's kind of cool walking around as a zombie

51
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:06,740
Sorry your mic was acting up there a little bit. We got you though. I need to discipline it. Get me a ruler smack that ass

52
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:09,460
Mummy, well he played um

53
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:12,060
Metal Slug X last night on the maim

54
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:15,540
Dan and I did we beat it we beat it with

55
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:20,360
Like authority and when you say you played it on the maim you mean one of those we have

56
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:25,160
not one of those maim cabinets we have a pole position that we put a computer in

57
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:31,640
and are playing maim on it with a hand-built um joystick rig everything

58
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:35,160
that's awesome and it still has all the pole position logos and all that I'll

59
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:38,880
put pictures up on it up on the web you need to be great um but we played a

60
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:44,040
Metal Slug X last night and I'm hoping to convince them to play through some

61
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:48,040
space Harrier with me because you put infinite credits in space Harrier and

62
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:53,500
it's on because that game lasts forever or maybe some blazing star hmm sounds

63
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:59,820
like fun anything else beside the retro um widescreen pong all right Loki how

64
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:06,220

65
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:11,020
a main cabinet in there rub it in a little more why don't you know what we

66
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:16,380
could do for you we could get you we could get you a one of those mini Mac

67
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:21,420
things you know five hundred dollars get you a cabinet that they're thrown away

68
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:26,260
for a hundred we could build you a main for under 800 dude I live upstairs or

69
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:30,460
sorry do debt I live upstairs we're not hauling a very a gutted machine upstairs

70
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:34,340
it's not that heavy we had a pole position machines all in my living room

71
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:37,540
you know what a barcade if I want to get the main cabinet in here I'm gonna have

72
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:41,940
to get rid of your chair no you know actually our next project is getting one

73
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:45,980
of those cocktail machines the table looking ones now that I would have in

74
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:49,940
the house. I would get rid of the kitchen table even though it's my roommate's and have

75
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:54,020
the cocktail cabinet. That would be rock. But we're planning on doing that as our next

76
00:04:54,020 --> 00:05:00,820
meme. Sweet. Anyway, Loki, your gaming week. Um, I tried Super Monkey Ball Deluxe for the

77
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:09,720
Playstation 2 and I'm here to say that it sucks ass. It's, Super Monkey Ball lends itself

78
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:14,180
to make it look like, oh yeah, it's a cool kids game, people might like it. You go and

79
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:19,820
you're like, what the fuck? This sucks. It's hard and it sucks. I didn't like it and it

80
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:27,820
was boring and I just didn't like it. Then I looked at, I haven't really opened it up

81
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:32,940
yet, Area 51, a brand new game, so maybe I'll play that. I don't really know. It's like

82
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:37,420
all these first person shooters that are coming out nowadays. It's really a big whoop, you

83
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:41,540
know. But I played Final Fantasy XI for a little bit last night. I played with some

84
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:47,600
Japanese people and then I got tired and I didn't want to be you know giving them

85
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:53,320
a 30-minute notice so I just fake disconnected and left shame on you hey I

86
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:58,180
was playing for four hours I was that like one last original players you know

87
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:01,640
from the party I'm like screw it you know I'm not gonna give them any more

88
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:06,260
notice cuz I'm like falling asleep my computer so I waited for the you know

89
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:13,080
the last thing to die at you know the end of our chain and I fake disconnected

90
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:19,300
lovely so I don't know that's what's been what I've been doing that and a lot

91
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:24,500
of Ridge Racer for the PSP and luminous again I've been playing Ridge I beat

92
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:31,900
Pac-man finally and I beat was it I still have to beat the angel car a little

93
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:35,680
bit I played it a few times and it's still really hard isn't the Pac-man car

94
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:40,780
cool though. Not really. It's not as good as the one from Ridge Racer 4. Speaking of

95
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:44,020
Pac-Man, I have to get this off my chest before we get much further. Did you know your Pac-Pix

96
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:47,940
game came out this week? I know, but that's not the one that I was really interested in.

97
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:50,940
Oh, I was listening to a previous podcast and you said something about the Pac-Pix game,

98
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:54,700
so I'm happy to let you know. I want Pac-Pix, but I want the freaking Marble Madness looking

99
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:59,180
one. Yeah, okay. Pack and roll. Pack and roll. Yeah. Because it's like Marble Madness. Sorry,

100
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:04,220
Logan. Anything else? So anyways, yeah, just Ridge Racer and Luminous. I unlocked two more

101
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:06,340
uh... skins today

102
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:10,380
but as you know it really luminous it comes down to I don't have enough time

103
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:13,260
to play it so I can't really get that far

104
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:15,760
in the game but um

105
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:19,380
I don't know, Ridge Racer I like it. I was actually looking at some maybe getting some more

106
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:20,420
games coming

107
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:22,940
out pretty soon uh...

108
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:26,740
I don't really know what the hell it is with the PSP

109
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:29,220
and the games coming out like for example

110
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:33,100
you know you have Metal Gear Solid and people are like oh yeah Metal Gear Solid awesome

111
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,300
Wait, it's a card game, turn-based card game, what the f-

112
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,800
You mean Metal Gear Acid?

113
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,300
It actually plays more like one of those old school strategy games.

114
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,400
What the hell is this?

115
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:46,800
And then, then, then you go like, oh, armored core's coming out, yay, mech combat, yay.

116
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,800
Oh, I don't get to control them.

117
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,000
Boo, that sucks.

118
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:59,200
You know, I had games like that, or they actually had games through the PlayStation, you know, come out like that, and they sucked.

119
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,600
You know, where you have to create the AI for them and stuff.

120
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:05,120
that's not fun you want to play you know mech combat against each other you don't

121
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,760
want to like oh i'm gonna program the coolest mech

122
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:12,240
out there blah blah blah anyways so before i ramble too much you

123
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,760
know i was looking too late whatever hey you know i was looking at

124
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:20,800
mercury i might get that but you know yeah i'm waiting for smart bomb which

125
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,440

126
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:28,000
what else i played the uh midway collection and played tempest on it

127
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,120
uh wait a minute tempest is in the midway collection

128
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:31,620
Isn't it?

129
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:32,120
Yeah.

130
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:32,620
Isn't it?

131
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:33,620
It'll be Atari.

132
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:34,120
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

133
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:34,620
The Atari one.

134
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:35,120
I'm sorry.

135
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:35,620
Atari.

136
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:36,120
Whatever, whatever.

137
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,120
Yeah, I played Tempest on it, which was pretty cool.

138
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:38,620
Cool.

139
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:39,620
Yeah, you-

140
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:40,620
Tempest is awesome.

141
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,620
You just go back and forth, just like with the trackball.

142
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,620
Tempest is awesome, but Tempest 2000 was better.

143
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:46,620
It's all about the music in Tempest 2000.

144
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:47,620
Let's see.

145
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:49,120
Super Zapper Recharge.

146
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:49,620
Let's see.

147
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:50,620
What else?

148
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:52,620
What was my gaming week like?

149
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:58,120
You know, I did one of these interesting things where I bought a game without actually having the console.

150
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,620
I don't know if any of you have ever done this.

151
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:04,540
I actually bought a copy of luminous this week, even though I personally don't own a PSP yet because I'm poor

152
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:12,420
My friend actually went and we were out and about the other night and he decided he wanted to get a PSP

153
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:16,660
But he couldn't really afford because you know when you go to buy a game system you buy the game system

154
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:19,900
And then you buy the game and the memory card and then whatever else goes with it

155
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,460
So pretty soon you're making a pretty big investment

156
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:25,460
You can't really get a PSP for 250 you have to put in 350 if you want to get you know

157
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,580
Everything good with it

158
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:29,800
So he decided he was gonna buy it all but he was only gonna get one game

159
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:33,480
He decided to get dark stalkers and I'm like, dude, you can't have a PSP and not have luminous

160
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:37,480
So I was like, you know what? I'm gonna buy luminous. I'm gonna get a PSP soon enough

161
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:41,000
So I bought luminous like the sucker I am and so I let him borrow it. I

162
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:48,440
Don't know if any of you guys have ever done that before but that's um, this is crazy me I guess I guess I had

163
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,360
them

164
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:54,240
Money to burn and I don't know why I would buy that and just not buy a PSP, but whatever

165
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:59,480
it was a moment of weakness, what can I say, but at least I have a copy of Luminous now.

166
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:04,040
Also this week I got to go to my very first video game premiere, which was kind of cool.

167
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:10,460
It was a party for Red Octane's In The Groove, which is kind of, it's very, very similar

168
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:15,780
to Dance Dance Revolution, and in fact if you are a member of the music gaming community

169
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:20,160
you probably have seen these debates going back and forth, is In The Groove too much

170
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,840
like DDR what all those arguments aside I had a really good time at the show

171
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:28,800
which took place in San Francisco they really know how to throw a party it was

172
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,360
great open bar and everything the game itself looks very smooth and made a

173
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:36,160
great transition from the arcade to the home version I was very impressed with

174
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,540
the new dance pads that showed up as well red octane's new afterburner pad

175
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:45,960
awesome so I was pretty happy with that so if you are a fan of in the groove

176
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,920
you're not gonna be disappointed by the home release what can I say and that was

177
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:51,680
pretty much my gaming week not a whole lot else outside of that that I haven't

178
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:56,280
already been playing and talked about on a previous show so why don't we get into

179
00:10:56,280 --> 00:11:00,360
some gaming news first off since we're talking about the music games and a lot

180
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:05,200
of people know us because of our music and gaming affiliation that our 24-hour

181
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:10,960
stream has over on live 365 there actually were some leaks this week that

182
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:16,520
DDR extreme 2 and ultra mix 3 are confirmed and gonna be shown at e3 this

183
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:20,800
And it's pretty cool because UltraMix 3 has some interesting new modes in it, such as

184
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:25,620
Quest Mode, where it sounds like you're going to have a story where you go around and meet

185
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:28,000
other DDR characters.

186
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,240
Kind of a first for a home release.

187
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,240
Should be interesting.

188
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,240
Logan?

189
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:34,960
Yeah, I've been actually asking for that, you know, I think it'd be interesting.

190
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:41,240
I mean, I've played Quest Modes in all the weird games, like everything from Tabal to,

191
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:44,460
you know, Gun Bullet 2 or Point Blank 2.

192
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:46,320
How bad can it be, huh?

193
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,400
dance dance dance bad I don't know we'll see

194
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:53,040
I don't even remember dance dance dance old um let's see also

195
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,640
extreme 2 getting a lot of raised eyebrows because

196
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:00,680
the article that was leaked on game pro confirms that

197
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:04,360
genie in a bottle and oops I did it again are gonna be in it

198
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,880
and a lot of us some hardcore music game fans are like

199
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:12,960
oh god oh god no oh god but we're kinda hoping that

200
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:16,680
those are the only two really really commercial songs in it to sell the game

201
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,200
and then the rest are gonna be like cool

202
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:22,400
uh... new stuff you know from not well-known artists you know

203
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,880
we'll see they confirm that it was a purple interface

204
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,040
we don't know you know we don't know inside joke

205
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,580
uh... let's see

206
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:32,800
also red octane announcing not only the publishing in the group they're into a

207
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,880
new harmonics game later this year guitar hero

208
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,660
so

209
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:39,580
now you can dance at home and you can play the guitar at home

210
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:41,120
how cool is that

211
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:48,480
And you can sing at home. You can be a one-man band, dance, sing, and play the guitar, but not all at once, unless you have multiple systems.

212
00:12:48,480 --> 00:13:01,760
That would be pretty smart. No, think about this. That'd be really cool. Land-wise, to link these games together for, like, you know, kind of like they did with the arcade with Drummania and Guitar Freaks,

213
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:05,480
to be able to land these like different games together or whatever and be able to play like

214
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:09,200
a song you know one person sings the lyrics the other person plays the guitar the other

215
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:14,800
one you know does you know whatever you know a keyboard or something why don't they do

216
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,640
that that this is what they need to be doing i i wouldn't complain it'll be kind of neat

217
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:24,840
it's my idea pat and penny all right um let's get into some game news tonight uh starting

218
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:28,280
off we'll talk about something music related not necessarily music game related but the

219
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:34,640
other way around game games music that the music from the games they're going

220
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:40,320
to be doing a tour called video games live this is being put together by Tommy

221
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,720
Tolarko who you guys might know from the television and other stuff he's done

222
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:49,520
music for games ready g4 man and the Clear Channel music group are putting

223
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:54,180
this thing together it's going to be starting off with a July 6 show at the

224
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:57,640
Hollywood Bowl and it'll go on some other venues announced in Denver and

225
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:03,720
Boston they'll be doing some music playing Halo Metal Gear Solid music and

226
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:10,060
then interestingly enough they also mention Donkey Kong and Pong. Pong didn't

227
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:15,080
have music did it? I have no idea what they mean by music from Pong but it's in

228
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:20,280
there so go figure. Also interesting to note Final Fantasy will have its music

229
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,900
played even though Final Fantasy is doing their own concert so I don't know

230
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:28,200
if they had the license or whatever they're doing they're being sneaky but also they're

231
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:34,760
gonna say not only is it the orchestra playing the music but choirs and laser shows and footage

232
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:41,900
of games freaking laser shows oh goody laser shows it'll be all it'll be like you ever

233
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:45,500
been to one of those shows where they play Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon to Wizard

234
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:53,780
of Oz no freaking lasers are they ill-tempered video games anyway so that

235
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:56,360
should be interesting do you guys have any interest in checking this out I know

236
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:00,880
I'm going to the Final Fantasy concert as is Loki the more friends does this

237
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,040
sound like something we ought to be getting tickets for to or no no I'm

238
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:08,960
going to the art show thank you and then I'm going clubbing and then I'm getting

239
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:12,680
some chicken and waffles no but this is not taking but this is something that's

240
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:17,560
in the country it's not just e3 so that being said would is it something if

241
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:21,080
hypothetically if this came to san francisco would you go no if somebody

242
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:26,920
drives me i would not go because tommy telarco is attached to it tommy telarco

243
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:31,320
for me is like bobby flay on the goddamn food network and for anyone that knows

244
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:35,800
me you know how much i hate bobby flay i will actually sit there and watch

245
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:40,360
bobby flay's show and scowl at him the entire time even though he can't see me

246
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:45,400
through the TV, but I will do it anyways. And I friggin' hate him because he's a little

247
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:50,760
whiny bastard. And guess what? Tommy DeLargo is a little whiny bastard just as well. He's

248
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:56,200
the Bobby Flay of G4. Are you calling him out at the bike racks after school? I think

249
00:15:56,200 --> 00:16:00,960
you are. You know, I don't care. That's fighting words, Loki. He made, he made, you know, game

250
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:06,280
music a long time ago. Good for him. You know, wow, he had a job. Okay, now he's reviewing

251
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:13,280
games for G4. Guess what? I don't care.

252
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:18,560
Another thing that most of us don't care about but it's worth mentioning anyway, MTV's Movie

253
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:23,480
Awards. Now you might be thinking, what the heck do movie awards have to do with video

254
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:27,560
games? Well, I don't know, it's just like what the heck does music have to do with MTV

255
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:33,280
anymore? Good question. Well, MTV Music Awards, I'm sorry, the Movie Awards will be adding

256
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:40,960
a category best video game based on a movie that is great the nominees for

257
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:45,760
best video game based on a movie spider-man 2 chronicles of Riddick

258
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:51,160
escape from butcher Bay Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Van Helsing and

259
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:56,600
the Incredibles I'm sure that the game for Van Helsing has to be a lot better

260
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:00,600
than the movie I'm sure it was too I wasn't much I did not play a single one

261
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:04,760
of these games no I take that back I played it like 10 minutes of Harry

262
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:08,600
Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban it's about it because I have all my friends

263
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:13,520
are Harry Potter geeks absolute Harry Potter geeks not that that's bad I'm

264
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,760
just saying they're geeks I only bought one Harry Potter game and it was awful

265
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:20,420
but it seemed like it was based more off the book than off the movie I was not a

266
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:26,000
fan of the why is in Grand Theft Auto nominated because it's best video game

267
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,600
based on a movie

268
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:32,620
vice city was based on uh... miami vice now when he shown will have based on

269
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:36,280
miami vice and it was also based on uh...

270
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,140
uh... god uh...

271
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,140
uh...

272
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:45,360
alpachino movie uh... scarface scarface exit

273
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,840
i think unfortunately it's a little bit of a stretch um... there

274
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:53,620
thankfully they wouldn't they didn't do best movie based on a video game maybe

275
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:56,880
Maybe they were going to try and do it, but then they realized, gee, what came out this

276
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,880
year?

277
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:03,100
Um, Alone in the Dark, Resident Evil Apocalypse, um, what's the other one?

278
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,100
Was there another one?

279
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,100
There was another one?

280
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,100
The, the, the island one.

281
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,100
Alone in the Dark.

282
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:09,200
Alone in the Dark.

283
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,300
And then they thought, we really want to give an award to one of these crappy games?

284
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:16,820
Please do not, do not, I don't want to hear award winning Alone in the Dark.

285
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:18,300
Yeah, that would be horrible.

286
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,300
No.

287
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,180
No, we don't need that man making any more movies.

288
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:24,860
Speaking of movies,

289
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:30,060
what do you think about this, Loki? The PSP UMD format has been cracked.

290
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:34,020
You can now read the files off of the UMD disks for the PSP.

291
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:39,180
And this is, let's see, coming off a story that actually in Gadgetran

292
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:42,980
that they did this, and now ISO's popping up all over the internet.

293
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:47,700
What do you think? There's three of them. There's Wipeout, the USA version,

294
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,900
there's Ridge Racer, the Japanese version, and then there's

295
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:54,020
some other tower of some...

296
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:57,220
vampire chronicles, the gas tower.

297
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:00,380
I already have the ISO for the white belt.

298
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:03,500
Yeah, but what can you do with it? Because the USDs are in those little case

299
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,420
things and you can't really burn...

300
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:08,540
it was kind of smart what Sony did there. I bet they did it just to combat piracy.

301
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:10,980
Well, here's what you can do with it, okay?

302
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:14,180
You can take the files and try the reverse engineering,

303
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:19,500
which is going to be close to impossible. You can rip some of the, like,

304
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:24,240
I'm sure some of the graphics from it, but that's really useless crap anyways, you know.

305
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:31,060
You can look at, there are individual files in there that, they're basically these files

306
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:37,600
called ELF files or whatever, and they're basically like executables or whatever, and

307
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:41,100
you can probably try to create something out of that.

308
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:44,440
Basically the whole reason I think that they ripped Wipeout is because they're looking

309
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,000
for the web browser.

310
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,320
Wasn't ELF a band?

311
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,320
Forget it.

312
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,360
E.L.O., Electric Light Orchestra.

313
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,000
Or maybe I'm thinking EMF.

314
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Never mind.

315
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Whatever.

316
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Anyways.

317
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:04,680
But this is just a step, because later on this week actually, or last week I should

318
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:10,720
say, right after this story came out, they actually announced that they had run code

319
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:16,920
on the Japanese PSP, the version 1.0, because all the US ones are shipped version 1.5, where

320
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:27,180
the hole is covered but basically this guy who actually has one of the development kits

321
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:35,800
he created his own like you know hello world program and it runs off of a memory card.

322
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:39,240
Any other interesting hack stories going on?

323
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:45,400
Yes the Nintendo DS we've been saying it you know and there's actually you know the joke

324
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:52,320
out there about installing Linux on Dead Badger, but now it's Linux for the DS, that's right.

325
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:58,680
They have successfully booted a kernel on there, and for those who don't know that's

326
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:05,740
like the operating system type of thing, and are actually running this shell called SASH,

327
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:11,000
and simple text games are on there, so you know, all those old like, you know, things

328
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,880
Zork or whatever you know that type of thing

329
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:18,400
uh... but yeah there's some information on that on the mod gods dot com they have

330
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,320
a whole thing on it and uh...

331
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:24,640
I don't really follow the Linux thing that much. That would only be cool if Zork was one of

332
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,480
the text games that they ported

333
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,720
then I might consider. They have Zork as a 404 message

334
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,360
I don't know but anyways

335
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:35,940
uh... yeah that's what's going on there it's still you know

336
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:39,400
I think it'll be cool because just because you can do an actual like soft

337
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,560
keyboard on there

338
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:44,560
using the touch screen and, you know, versus, you know, trying to

339
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,880
type on the

340
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:49,960
the PSP is just crap. Honestly, I hate to say it, but nothing is cool on the DS

341
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:53,640
right now. Honestly, I'm getting to that point where I'm getting really fed up with the lack of

342
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:56,000
quality games on the DS right now.

343
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
It's sad.

344
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,640
I don't know what else to say. Nintendo better impress me at E3 or I'm not even

345
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,160
going to talk about DS anymore.

346
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,880
Might be just selling mine.

347
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:04,640
We'll see.

348
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,720
Well, there are, there is hope.

349
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:11,760
Bomberman is going to be coming on to the DS, and that's kind of an interesting concept,

350
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:16,920
because they're actually going to have eight-way wireless multiplayer, only one game cart needed.

351
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,800
So that's kind of neat.

352
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:24,220
Because there are eight players, they'll actually use both DS screens during the game to kind

353
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:27,980
of spread things out a little bit, because it might get kind of crowded with eight people

354
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,140
on one screen.

355
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:35,520
So it should be interesting, hopefully can restore my faith in the DS a little bit, we'll

356
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,520
see.

357
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:39,680
nearest school Super Bomberman 2 was I'll get I'll have it

358
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:46,660
well June 21st is the date we'll find out all right um let's go ahead and let

359
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:51,540
Dark Sakura present her advice column because you know we here at Orange

360
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:54,780
Lounge Radio we're not just here to talk about games but we're also here to

361
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:59,540
better your life because if we talked about video games all the time we'd have

362
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:03,860
no time to go out and get our hair did so Dark Sakura it's your turn to give us

363
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:07,860
What are you going to talk to us about tonight, my friend?

364
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:10,860
Today's advice is how to treat a severed limb.

365
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:16,860
Number one, locate any individual bleeding arteries on the stump.

366
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:19,860
Two, pinch off the large arteries.

367
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:23,860
Three, apply a tourniquet. Choose a strip of material at least an inch wide.

368
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:28,860
Tie it around the stump as close to the end as possible so it will not fall off when tightened.

369
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:32,380
tie it moderately tight tighten just enough to stop most of the bleeding

370
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:37,660
keep pinching the arteries. Four, tie off the ends of any blood vessels being pinched

371
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:41,300
use fishing line dental floss or heavy thread and a sewing needle if

372
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,100
available to

373
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:45,680
carefully tie off arteries. Five, clean the stump thoroughly.

374
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:50,340
Six, loosen the tourniquet. As pressure from the tourniquet decreases check your

375
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:50,860
ties

376
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:54,620
if bleeding is just moderate you can remove the tourniquet. In order to preserve

377
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:57,880
tissue at the stump do not leave a tourniquet applied for more than 90

378
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:58,460
minutes.

379
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:05,460
Seven, dress the stump. Tightly cover the end of the stump with clean cloth or gauze.

380
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:10,460
Now my final advice though, is stop playing with those branch cutters.

381
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:16,460
Clean the stump thoroughly.

382
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:20,460
Well yeah, you don't want any axe shavings on it or something.

383
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:21,460
Ew.

384
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,460
Or chainsaw oil.

385
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:28,460
You know, now I'm thinking about the end of Fargo and I'm getting all grossed.

386
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:30,460
I've never seen that, but you know, they had on a...

387
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:32,460
Well, I just wrote it for you, but it's alright.

388
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:33,460
Like I'll ever see it.

389
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:36,460
But you know, they had on the Darwin Awards.

390
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:42,460
There was two guys' brothers and they had this bright idea that one would cut off the other's leg with a chainsaw.

391
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:43,460
Hilarious!

392
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:45,460
Well, of course he died.

393
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:49,460
But not if he had heard your advice. Maybe he wouldn't have died.

394
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:53,680
Nah, I doubt it. He cut through a major artery in the leg and that's one of the ones that's

395
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,040
like

396
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:58,940
cutting your, you know, one in your neck. I was just trying to promote your column over here.

397
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:04,020
You know, but I still don't like stupid people to breed, so. Yeah, really your column will do no

398
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:05,060
good for stupid people.

399
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:08,780
So anyway. This is how to preserve the lives of intelligent people.

400
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:13,100
Um, let's talk about another big story that was going on in the gaming world.

401
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:16,580
Namco has merged with

402
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:21,580
Bandai Bandai has bought Japanese developer and publisher Namco

403
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:24,900
very interesting it's gonna be named the new company

404
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:29,820
Namco Bandai Holdings and it is official as of September 29th

405
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:33,540
2005 and I believe this makes them the

406
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:36,700
third largest, don't quote me on that third largest gaming company

407
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:41,060
well you know this also means huh that means that what we get out of this

408
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:44,220
is a new Dragon Ball Z game with the Tekken 5 engine

409
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:49,660
be interesting but I don't know I always thought maybe this is me personally

410
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:50,540
maybe I'm just not

411
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:54,100
giving enough respect to Bandai but I always kinda preferred what Namco put

412
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:55,020
out so I'm a little

413
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:59,340
sad that Bandai bought Namco and not the other way around. If you play imports though it's

414
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:00,380
all about Bandai

415
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:05,740
They put out all the DBZ games, Bonpresto put out

416
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:10,600
this game that it's a lot like Guardian Heroes. Maybe that's what it is because I

417
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,100
play some imports but I don't play

418
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:16,380
a lot you know this means so hmm that in the next Tekken game

419
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:19,220
you might have a hidden character that is Hello Kitty

420
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:22,340
that's true you may have a

421
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:26,580
Goku in Tekken if we can have Gon in Tekken 3

422
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:31,340
just think about it. I'm not going to hold my breath for Hello... That's Maru in Tekken 5

423
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:36,100
Hello Kitty fighting game the concept kind of

424
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:39,980
scares me a little. I think it would be awesome they really need to do that

425
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:41,380
It would just be cool.

426
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:44,980
I choose Twinkle Stars as the Twin Stars!

427
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:50,480
No, what would be great is to do the Hello Kitty fighting game and make it as violent as like Tekken 5 or something.

428
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:55,480
The Twin Stars would be about as effective as the Ice Climbers in Smash Bros. Melee,

429
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,980
and everybody hates playing the Ice Climbers. I don't know anybody that didn't play the Ice Climbers.

430
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:01,980
No way! Dan plays the Ice Climbers, and he's awesome with them.

431
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:05,480
Well, he's a freak of nature or something, because nobody's good with the Ice Climbers.

432
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:08,480
But we have Ice Climbers on our nest.

433
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,000
Oh, dude, that game was awesome. Don't get me wrong. All right

434
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,480
If you guys have any feedback on our show you want to write us and tell us that you are a nice climbers player

435
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,440
I don't know

436
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,400
Send us an email to go to at orange lounge radio

437
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:22,780
calm and

438
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:27,320
We might read some of your letters on the show now one thing that we have been getting in the mailbox

439
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:33,520
Is that we have been getting a lot of response from folks overseas actually. Yes, we have

440
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:40,000
Yeah, actually as a result now weíre going to start covering a little bit more of the

441
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,960
UK Europe news for them.

442
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:47,960
So letís start it off, Dark Sakura you have agreed to kind of head up the UK scene, so

443
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,640
whatís going on for our friends overseas?

444
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:53,560
Well first and foremost because I know thereís been an issue of debate because for a while

445
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:57,460
there was one thing being said by Sony and Amazon had a different date for the release

446
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:59,120
dates of the PSP.

447
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,960
Now both of them are completely in sync.

448
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:09,360
The PSP will be available for 179 pounds on 1st of September.

449
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:16,060
It's going to be a value pack that consists of the system, a pouch, 32 megabyte memory

450
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:23,700
stick duo, a battery pack, headphones with remote control, AC adapter, wrist strap, cloth,

451
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:24,900
and a sampler disc.

452
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:32,120
You can also go to URPSP.com, Y-O-U-R-P-S-P dot com and order a copy of Spiderman 2 that

453
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,880
will be shipped to you for free.

454
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:42,420
Amazon UK is taking pre-orders at £179.

455
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:47,040
I also do have a few release dates for GameCube.

456
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:51,960
This month coming up on the 20th we have Fairly Odd Parents Shadow Showdown, an Animaniacs

457
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,840
game with an unannounced date.

458
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,040
Dude, they're still making Animaniacs games? I didn't know that.

459
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:58,540
I don't know why. No one watches that anymore.

460
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:01,340
Is it even on TV anymore?

461
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:03,140
No. Actually, yeah.

462
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:05,440
It must be big in Britain. I don't know.

463
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,640
June 2005 for GameCube.

464
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,440
Donkey Konga 2 hitsong parade.

465
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,140
Ah, very cool.

466
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:12,840
Medal of Honor, European assault.

467
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:15,340
Killer 7, Batman Begins.

468
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:19,040
Something struck me as ironic about the European assault game.

469
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,140
Why do you think I snorted?

470
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:20,440
Yeah, I know.

471
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:24,440
July 2005, on the first we have Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six 4 Lockdown.

472
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:30,440
Um, lastly they're on fourth quarter, we have Rats, Rock, Angels, and Prince of Persia 3.

473
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,440
Oh, hurrah.

474
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:35,440

in

493
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:01,820
here in America it's kinda interesting to hear the delay of games

494
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:04,560
unfortunately, you know, sometimes we bitch and complain about how long games

495
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:07,880
take to come over from Japan, but man, you know, you're in Britain, you gotta wait for the

496
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,720
PAL translation and everything, it takes forever.

497
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:13,420
So we kinda get to hear about that, but it's kind of interesting if you're on the

498
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:15,240
other side of it and you're in Britain listening to this,

499
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:18,920

our email. Yes. We actually did get some good email.

529
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:18,180
Lee wrote in and said that we make his LA drive a lot easier to deal with.

530
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:22,580
Oh, thank you. Thank you very much. And also heard from

531
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:26,940
Tommy who says he enjoys our podcasts and

532
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:31,160
you know, that we hold his attention. So hey, if we can hold your attention...

533
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:37,760
if we can distract a gamer from the games just for long enough that totally

534
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:41,160
is awesome yeah great you for writing in thank you we appreciate the support you

535
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:46,600
guys are awesome that's great all right um let's see the Xbox 360 we've got news

536
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:51,500
on that it is coming out in November basically what happened is that Bill

537
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:54,320
Gates was kind of the one that accidentally spilled the news on that a

538
00:33:54,320 --> 00:34:00,720
little bit MTV's confirming it November is the month for the Xbox 360 and early

539
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:05,540
Pictures have been leaked and are hitting the internet. Of course that MTV special is this week

540
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:11,520
I probably won't be watching because you know, I we're we're lucky enough to get to go to e3 next week

541
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,280
So let's check it out then

542
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:18,520
but see folks on honestly if they've they've made the console bigger

543
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:28,200
But why it's it's white and virginal it is it is bigger it looks the size of now

544
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:35,200
now my Comcast receiver and that sucker is huge. I mean, that's like, this is like one

545
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:42,260
and a half Xbox size-wise. It's almost, it is almost the size of a PC case. Alright.

546
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,600
Well, we'll see what happens with that.

547
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,960
That's maybe because it is a PC.

548
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:54,100
Oh, and guess what? They came up with a brand new original idea for a webcam. My ad is very

549
00:34:54,100 --> 00:35:01,360
ugly and their brand new controller has like a trackball in it there's some

550
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:05,860
people are seeing trackballs some people are thinking it might be a gyroscope oh

551
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:09,580
that'd be kind of weird so when you tilt the controller does weird shit but

552
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:12,880
honestly I think it's just a little stupid logo thing that probably does

553
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:19,320
nothing all right let's move on and talk about a story that affects us we

554
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:22,540
actually based our show out of California there's an interesting build

555
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:28,100
going on in California, it will ban the sale of violent video games to minors, and the

556
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:33,580
law so far has passed review by a 6-4 vote, which means now it goes to the assembly.

557
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:37,600
After the assembly, it goes to the Senate, and if it passes both there, which we kind

558
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:43,620
of expect it will, it means that it will be illegal to sell violent video games to minors.

559
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:45,620
You know what?

560
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:48,060
It's ridiculous.

561
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:52,940
All this is, is another example of parents not doing their damn jobs and expecting the

562
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:55,600
government to do it for them.

563
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:58,580
That's the only reason this is going to pass is because of their lazy asses.

564
00:35:58,580 --> 00:35:59,580
They're wanting...

565
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:00,780
That's why we have censorship.

566
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:05,820
That's why the FCC is as rampant as it is these days, is because they do not want to

567
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:08,060
take responsibility.

568
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:12,080
If you're going to breed a child, they need to make you sign a fucking contract that says,

569
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:18,520
I am going to raise my child and have some type of control over what they do.

570
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:22,480
That's what being a parent is, it's not about lobbying the government to do it for you.

571
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,440
That's called being fucking lazy.

572
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:30,160
I don't have a, I don't know, I'm like, I totally see that point of it, and I'm not

573
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:33,360
saying this is something that like needs to happen, but it's kind of one of those things

574
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:37,400
where it's like it doesn't totally bug me because, you know, we shouldn't sell violent

575
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:43,960
video games to minors, but I think you're right, where the parents have to really have

576
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:48,360
a more active role in what their minors are buying, really, so...

577
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:53,800
You know, it's good, I think having the rating system is good, because then you're giving

578
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:58,520
them a way to understand what type of game it is that they're purchasing for their child.

579
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:01,880
But I find it very interesting that they will pass a law for this, however, they've never

580
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:08,200
passed a law that says a movie theater must make sure that there is a child 17

581
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:12,440
or when a child 17 or younger is coming in there is a guardian with them or they

582
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:16,040
will be arrested because that crap happens all the time where kids get into

583
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:19,240
R-rated movies so why are you picking on the video game industry I don't know

584
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:23,440
maybe there is a law on the books but you and I know nobody enforces that law

585
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:27,080
when we were kids we got an R-rated movies all the time but the thing is is

586
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:33,640
And this actually is directly affecting, you know, my life because my fiance manages a

587
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:35,360
GameStop.

588
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:41,000
You know, what if some kid comes in and one of his employees sells the game and then it

589
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:45,440
gets back to GameStop corporate when their parent raises a big fit on it and they fire,

590
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,440
you know, him as the manager.

591
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,440
Yeah, it's just...

592
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:53,560
You know, this is just more of a case of people sticking their nose where it doesn't belong.

593
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:56,640
You know, if you want to stick your nose somewhere, shove it right back up your ass where it's

594
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:01,800
been for the last 50 years it's a very passionate subject for you all right

595
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:06,200
we'll probably get some emails on that one good job all right I welcome emails

596
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:11,720
on that okay all right just I want to hear from your parents and I will tell

597
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:16,500
them exactly how I feel and why they're being retards happy Mother's Day by the

598
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:23,760
way happy Mother's Day all right um let's move on to just a couple of last

599
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:28,540
stories here ever quest 2 is expanding there's a brand new expansion pack

600
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:34,800

can advance to level 60 30 bucks for this pack coming out September 12th the

602
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:42,940
only reason I bring this up is because I wanted to mention that I saw ever quest

603
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:48,620
2 for sale at a big store here the other day and it was only 20 bucks and I was

604
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:54,260
kinda tempted and then I was like dude it's ever quest I know that's how they

605
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:58,020
get you but you know before we know you'll be slash pizza eating all the

606
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:01,460
time you know the MMO I really want to check out because people are not

607
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:04,300
shutting up about this and everybody I've talked to says it's fabulous

608
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:10,540
Guild Wars I kind of want to play world of war crack yeah I've heard things

609
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:14,780
about that too but Guild Wars is now the one I'm really hearing about I have to

610
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:18,380
say I'm kind of sort of interested you know what I'm just waiting for Ragnarok

611
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:20,180
two to come out and I'll be happy.

612
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:22,140
We'll see.

613
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:25,380
And lastly, one last story.

614
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:30,200
Dark Sakura, we've talked about import gaming, especially on our live three-hour program

615
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:33,260
that we have Sunday nights over on OrangeLawsRadio.com.

616
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:36,980
We've talked about places where you should buy import games and places where you should

617
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:40,580
not buy import games because we're into import gaming.

618
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:43,820
What types of sites on the internet would you recommend?

619
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:46,340
And keep in mind we're not being sponsored by anybody.

620
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:48,880
This is just personal opinion.

621
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:49,880
What sites would you recommend?

622
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:53,500
NCSX, first and foremost, Japan Video Games.

623
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:55,100
Play Asia has been decent to me.

624
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:57,740
I do know people who have had problems with them.

625
00:39:57,740 --> 00:40:04,660
I actually have had good experience with Lixang, too, but NCSX just sits at the top of all

626
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:05,660
of them.

627
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:08,060
Japan Video Games is another pretty good one.

628
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:11,480
It's where I ordered my Beatmania to, not my Drawmania.

629
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:14,820
They're the only import company I've bought from, actually, and I don't have any complaints.

630
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:15,820
They're good.

631
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:20,780
Okay, but if you say there was one that you would never recommend to anybody and you would

632
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:23,020
say forget it, don't ever do this, what would you say?

633
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:24,020
Buy right.

634
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:25,020
And why?

635
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:29,860
They have stolen money from me, not delivered, promised product.

636
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:35,940
I ordered and I specified Japanese Tekken 4, they sent me the Asian release and then

637
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:38,940
when I emailed them and said, we didn't make any such promise.

638
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:40,600
Well guess what?

639
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:45,140
The Better Business Bureau and the North Carolina Attorney General's Office have taken action

640
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:50,380
against BuyRight Video Games and they have closed their doors and ceased operations as

641
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:52,820
a result.

642
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:57,300
BuyRight Video Games of course sold used antique and imported games and they were doing refurbished

643
00:40:57,300 --> 00:41:02,180
systems and stuff but it's interesting because if you check out the website fatwallet.com

644
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:06,020
a bunch of people were just complaining about this, they've been complaining about just

645
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:10,980
what Jamie said there, bad service, misrepresenting themselves and stealing your money.

646
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:18,420
So one quote said that they ordered a Saturn and it was cracked, Soul Caliber didnít work,

647
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:19,420
crazy.

648
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:24,520
Better Business Bureau says this, ìBased on BBB files, this company has an unsatisfactory

649
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:29,860
record due to unanswered complaints concerning delivery problems and product dissatisfaction.

650
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:35,040
The Bureau has processed 414 complaints about this company in the last 36 months.

651
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,040
Are you one of those?î

652
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:42,000
Yep, no, actually, um, no, I actually never got my thing to the Better Business Bureau don't I have the letter prepared

653
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
I'm actually I was gonna

654
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:49,840
I'm actually hoping that they are doing a class-action lawsuit because I'm gonna get in on that

655
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:57,560
Hmm. Well, this is interesting too is that on April 12th the North Carolina Attorney General's Office told by right video games

656
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,960
Basically to request that they do not take orders

657
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:04,440
inform customers of the business status and they have to provide a telephone

658
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:09,040
number for customers to contact them in case of complaints well guess what they

659
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:14,240
didn't comply because as of April 26th they shut them down good interesting so

660
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:20,760
we say good riddance I want to email them and gloat so that's gonna do it for

661
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:24,360
another podcast any parting words from Loki over there who's been kind of quiet

662
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:29,440
this last bit of show what was the thing about the two guys that were making

663
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:32,320
movie oh I ended up skipping that because we're running long but I'll

664
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:36,040
mention it real quick Clive Barker John will getting together to do this project

665
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:40,000
it's called demonic and basically what it is they're gonna be simultaneously

666
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:46,240
doing a next-gen console game and film at the same time so John will it's

667
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:49,000
interesting because he's been getting his hand in a lot of video games movies

668
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:54,640
lately not just Metroid spy hunter and now this so hey better him than you a

669
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,500
Ball as far as I'm concerned.

670
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:59,080
Five Barker, that's just awesome.

671
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:03,220
So this should be interesting, it'll be a horror action game.

672
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:06,560
But that's interesting because in 2006 we should also be getting the Silent Hill movie,

673
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,560
so we'll see, we'll see.

674
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:09,560
Silent Hill movie.

675
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:11,960
Alright, are you happy I brought that up now?

676
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:12,960
Loki?

677
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:13,960
That's fine.

678
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:16,320
Alright, parting words?

679
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:17,320

681
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:19,320

682
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:22,180
