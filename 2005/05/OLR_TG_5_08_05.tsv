229	3092	Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, week of May 9th, 2005.
3412	14103	You're tuned in to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your podcast home for all the latest video game news and gamer chat.
14363	17787	Now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.
19249	20370	Hello, everybody.
20850	29196	Once again, welcome to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your home for what you, the gamer, really want to know about.
29616	30457	My name is Rob Roberts.
30517	31577	You might know me as Sky.
31677	33699	Joining me, as always, my awesome co-hosts.
34239	36661	Say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
36921	38862	Yo, yo, yo, what up, my homies?
39123	39563	What up?
39903	40523	Girl, what up?
41804	43966	Ceiling, Sky, my cue.
45710	47652	Not your voice tonight, you're not perky tonight.
48032	48732	Hi!
48933	49813	Oh, that's much better.
49833	50554	Oh my god!
51054	54717	Oh, you're primed and ready for G4 now, thank you.
55758	57159	No, I'm not on enough drugs, thank you.
57279	59140	Say hello to Loki as well.
59560	59861	Hi.
60321	60981	How you doing, sir?
61582	64444	I'm looking for this... I'm trying to find this one game.
64904	68027	My friend at work was telling me about this crappy truck game.
68067	68447	It's like this
68919	70220	Diesel Truck Racing Game
87230	88251	I know what you're talking about.
88271	89152	I've seen it before somewhere.
89192	89693	I want to download it.
108741	110242	I don't actually want to buy it.
110282	110902	I just want to download it.
110982	112723	I call that a Walmart game.
113043	122447	And the reason why I call that a Walmart game is if you've ever been to Walmart, which I'm sure most people have if they have them in your area, if you go into the Walmart arcade, quote unquote, what do they always have?
122787	124608	They have the crane game that you can play.
125148	128010	And then they always have some type of hunting game.
128070	128710	Deer Hunter.
128730	129170	Deer Hunter.
129310	131992	And then usually they'll have like an 18-wheeler game.
132332	134213	But the Sega 18-wheeler game was good.
135273	136914	But Walmart doesn't have the Sega 18-wheeler game.
136934	137434	Because Walmart's...
138100	141503	I'm not big on Walmart, but we won't get into those reasons here on this program because we're going to talk about games.
160819	161039	Sorry.
161059	163221	Ranma is my favorite store.
163521	165183	You want to read more about it, read my blog.
165503	165783	Whatever.
166504	167705	Let's talk about games.
168426	169547	And your games, actually.
169567	170888	The games that you've been playing this week.
171408	171889	DarkSakura.
172649	175892	I played Metal Slug X last night on the MAME with my man.
176493	176993	And we beat it.
177033	177874	The game's freaking hard.
177914	179716	But it's kind of cool walking around as a zombie.
180656	181978	Sorry, your mic was acting up there a little bit.
182898	183359	We got you, though.
183379	184860	Well, I need to discipline it.
185320	185941	Get me a ruler.
186181	186922	Smack that ass.
187382	188043	Wasn't it, mommy?
188687	190949	Metal Slug X Metal Slug X
213174	215075	and it still has all the Pole Position logos and all that.
215095	216576	I'll put pictures on it up on the web.
216677	217057	You need to.
217077	218038	That'd be great.
218198	225323	But we played Metal Slug X last night and I'm hoping to convince them to play through some Space Harrier with me.
225683	228505	Because you put infinite credits in Space Harrier and it's on.
228545	229706	Because that game lasts forever.
230747	231807	Or maybe some Blazing Star.
233349	233849	Sounds like fun.
234049	235210	Anything else besides the retro?
235690	237452	Um, widescreen Pong.
238492	238812	Alright.
239473	240153	Loki, how about you?
240534	242215	Isn't it like scary that
242885	250475	2 out of 3 people in this studio have a MAME cabinet in their... Rub it in a little more, why don't ya?
250515	251877	You know what we could do for you?
252117	256983	We could get you one of those mini Mac things.
257644	257944	You know? $500.
260029	261790	Get you a cabinet that they're throwing away for $100.
262151	264012	We could build you a MAME for under $800.
264432	266313	Dude, I live upstairs.
266514	267134	Sorry, dudette.
267214	268155	I live upstairs.
268175	268995	We're not hauling a MAME.
269015	270596	You can carry a gutted machine upstairs.
270656	271377	It's not that heavy.
271757	274419	We had two pole position machines in my living room.
274499	275600	It's all about Barcade.
275900	278342	If I want to get the MAME cabinet in here, I'm going to have to get rid of your chair.
278762	278882	No.
280147	284768	Actually, our next project is getting one of those cocktail machines, the table-looking ones.
284989	286289	Now that I would have in the house.
286389	291170	I would get rid of the kitchen table, even though it's my roommate's, and have the cocktail cabinet.
291230	291951	That would be rock.
292011	294131	But we're planning on doing that as our next meme.
294851	295191	Sweet.
295952	297272	Anyway, Loki, your gaming week.
298592	305655	I tried Super Monkey Ball Deluxe for the PlayStation 2, and I'm here to say that it sucks ass.
307035	307155	It's
307990	337608	Super Monkey Ball lends itself to make it look like oh yeah it's a cool kids game people might like it you go and play it and you're like what the fuck this sucks it's hard and it sucks I didn't like it and it was boring and I just didn't like it then I looked at I haven't really opened it up yet Area 51 the brand new game so maybe I'll play that I don't really know it's like all these first person shooters that are coming out nowadays it's really big whoop you know
338052	340854	Final Fantasy XI Final Fantasy XI Final Fantasy XI Final Fantasy XI
364648	373052	So, I waited for the last thing to die at the end of our chain, and I fake disconnected.
373593	373953	Lovely.
375093	377134	So, I don't know.
377154	378555	So that's what I've been doing.
378595	381897	That and a lot of Ridge Racer for the PSP and Luminous.
381957	382397	Again?
382997	386139	I've been playing Ridge... I beat Pac-Man, finally.
386479	389141	And I beat... What was it?
389201	389721	I still have the...
390211	392011	Beat the Angel car a little bit.
392051	394472	I played it a few times and it's still really hard.
394892	396192	Isn't the Pac-Man car cool though?
396692	397193	Not really.
397253	399833	It's not as good as the one from Ridge Racer 4.
400393	403094	Speaking of Pac-Man, I have to get this off my chest before we get much further.
403114	404974	Did you know your Pac-Pix game came out this week?
405374	407735	I know, but that's not the one that I was really interested in.
408135	410876	Oh, I was listening to a previous podcast and you said something about the Pac-Pix game.
411696	414777	I want Pac-Pix, but I want the freaking Marble Madness looking one.
414837	415737	Yeah, I'll pack and roll.
415857	416417	Pack and roll.
417838	419820	Sorry, Loki, anything else?
419980	422541	So anyways, yeah, just Ridge Racer and Luminous.
422702	425543	I unlocked two more skins today.
426504	433909	But as you know, really Luminous, it comes down to I don't have enough time to play it, so I can't really get that far in the game.
434129	437051	But, I don't know, Ridge Racer, I like it.
437491	441294	I was actually looking at maybe getting some more games coming out pretty soon.
441314	441354	Um...
443038	448001	I don't know, they have, like, I don't really know what the hell it is with the PSP and the games coming out.
448041	452864	Like, for example, you know, you have Metal Gear Solid and people are like, oh, yeah, Metal Gear Solid, awesome.
453164	454885	Wait, it's a card game, turn-based card game.
454906	455526	What the fuck?
455626	456446	Metal Gear Acid.
456867	459328	It actually plays more like one of those old-school strategy games.
459348	460049	What the hell is this?
460529	463991	And then you go, like, oh, Armored Core's coming out.
464131	464532	Yay!
465072	466173	Mech Combat, yay!
467053	468914	Oh, I don't get to control them.
469895	470235	Boo.
470675	471096	That sucks.
471116	471456	That sucks.
472039	478661	You know, I had games like that, or they actually had games for the PlayStation, you know, come out like that, and they sucked.
479221	481621	You know, where you had to create the AI for them and stuff.
481881	482521	That's not fun.
482541	484942	You want to play, you know, mech combat against each other.
484962	489123	You don't want to, like, oh, I'm going to program the coolest mech out there, blah, blah, blah.
490083	493304	Anyways, so, before I ramble too much, you know, I was looking... Too late.
494264	494704	Whatever.
494724	496325	Hey, you know, I was looking at Mercury.
496345	501666	I might get that, but, you know, I'm waiting for Smart Bomb, which should be coming out pretty soon.
502307	503467	and I actually did play another game.
503587	503867	What else?
504408	507669	I played the Midway Collection and played Tempest on it.
508869	509289	Wait a minute.
509369	510670	Tempest isn't in the Midway Collection.
511250	511470	Isn't it?
511730	512030	Yeah.
512850	514191	Isn't Tempest... Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
514211	514751	The Atari one.
514771	515111	I'm sorry.
515151	515551	Atari.
515631	518072	Yeah, I played Tempest on it which was pretty cool.
518332	518512	Cool.
519252	520493	Yeah, Tempest is awesome.
520533	522374	Did you just go back and forth just like with Trackball?
522674	524315	Tempest is awesome, but Tempest 2000 was better.
525096	526837	It's all about the music in Tempest 2000.
527057	527497	Let's see.
527717	528838	Super Zapper Recharge.
529559	529939	Let's see.
529999	530359	What else?
530719	532100	What was my gaming week like?
533661	538384	You know, I did one of these interesting things where I bought a game without actually having the console.
538444	539705	I don't know if any of you have ever done this.
540166	544588	I actually bought a copy of Luminous this week, even though I personally don't own a PSP yet because I'm poor.
544608	545449	Okay.
546149	559902	My friend actually went and we were out and about the other night and he decided he wanted to get a PSP but he couldn't really afford because you know when you go to buy a game system, you buy the game system and then you buy the game and the memory card and whatever else comes with it.
559962	561444	So pretty soon you're making a pretty big investment.
561484	562765	You can't really get a PSP for $250.
563246	566569	You have to put in $350 if you want to get everything good with it.
567037	569879	So he decided he was going to buy it all, but he was only going to get one game.
569919	571160	He decided to get Darkstalkers.
571180	573522	And I'm like, dude, you can't have a PSP and not have Luminous.
573962	575423	So I was like, you know what?
575464	576284	I'm going to buy Luminous.
576364	577545	I'm going to get a PSP soon enough.
577765	579607	So I bought Luminous like the sucker I am.
579947	580868	And so I let him borrow it.
583390	587593	I don't know if any of you guys have ever done that before, but that's just crazy me, I guess.
588013	594298	I guess I had money to burn, and I don't know why I would buy that and just not buy a PSP, but whatever.
594318	595179	It was a moment of weakness.
595199	595679	What can I say?
595984	597426	But at least I have a copy of Luminous now.
599267	603151	Also, this week, I got to go to my very first video game premiere, which was kind of cool.
604052	613883	It was a party for Red Octane's In the Groove, which is kind of, it's very, very similar to Dance Dance Revolution, and in fact, if you are a member of the
614656	615857	Music Gaming Community.
615877	618899	You probably have seen these debates going back and forth.
618919	621121	Is In The Groove too much like DDR or what?
621782	626645	All those arguments aside, I had a really good time at the show, which took place in San Francisco.
627386	628647	They really know how to throw a party.
628667	629187	It was great.
629287	630188	Open bar and everything.
630709	632150	The game itself looks very smooth.
632170	635272	It made a great transition from the arcade to the home version.
635292	637774	I was very impressed with the new dance pads that showed up as well.
638334	640336	Red Octane's new afterburner pad, awesome.
640576	641957	So I was pretty happy with that.
643510	648012	So, if you are a fan of In the Groove, you're not going to be disappointed by the home release, what can I say?
648632	653613	And that was pretty much my gaming week, not a whole lot else outside of that that I haven't already been playing and talked about on a previous show.
654614	657555	So, why don't we get into some gaming news.
657615	666317	First off, since we were talking about the music games, and a lot of people know us because of our music and gaming affiliation that our 24-hour stream has over on Live365, we
669051	676717	There actually were some leaks this week that DDR Extreme 2 and Ultramix 3 are confirmed and going to be shown at E3 this year.
676757	686964	And it's pretty cool because Ultramix 3 has some interesting new modes in it, such as quest mode, where it sounds like you're going to have a story where you go around and meet other DDR characters.
687885	689126	Kind of a first for a home release.
689146	689746	Should be interesting.
690687	693249	Yeah, I've been actually asking for that.
693309	694890	You know, I think it'd be interesting.
694910	695190	I mean,
697145	705492	How bad can it be?
706353	707494	Dance, Dance, Dance bad?
707714	708055	I don't know.
708075	708475	We'll see.
709436	711158	I don't even remember Dance, Dance, Dance old.
711998	712339	Let's see.
712479	720526	Also, Extreme 2, getting a lot of raised eyebrows because the article that was leaked on GamePro confirms that
721178	724239	Genie in a Bottle, and Oops I Did It Again are going to be in it.
724640	730562	And a lot of us hardcore music game fans are like, oh god, oh god no, oh god.
731643	742028	But we're kind of hoping that those are the only two really, really commercial songs in it to sell the game, and then the rest are going to be like cool new stuff, you know, from not well-known artists, you know.
742418	742778	We'll see.
742958	745100	Did they confirm that it was a purple interface?
745941	746641	No, we don't know yet.
746661	747021	We don't know.
747402	748483	Inside joke.
748783	749163	Let's see.
749703	755328	Also, Red Octane announcing not only are they publishing in the group, but they're going to do a new harmonics game later this year, Guitar Hero.
755968	759351	So now you can dance at home and you can play the guitar at home.
759611	760171	How cool is that?
761192	761993	And you can sing at home.
762373	766456	You can be a one-man band, dance, sing, and play the guitar, but not all at once.
766576	766756	Honestly?
766776	767957	Unless you have multiple systems.
768598	769939	That would be pretty smart.
770339	771660	No, honestly, think about this.
772449	785957	That'd be really cool, land-wise, to link these games together for, like, you know, kind of like they did with the arcade with Drum Mania and Guitar Freaks, to be able to land these, like, different games together or whatever and be able to play, like, a song.
785977	793742	You know, one person sings the lyrics, the other person plays the guitar, the other one, you know, does, you know, whatever, you know, a keyboard or something.
794302	795043	Why don't they do that?
795323	796323	This is what they need to be doing.
797324	797984	I wouldn't complain.
798004	798645	It would be kind of neat.
798685	799746	It's my idea, Pat and Penny.
800506	800786	All right.
801647	801747	Um...
802697	803118	Video Games Live
818506	824090	This is being put together by Tommy Talarco, who you guys might know from the television and other stuff.
824450	825751	He's done music for games, right?
825791	827072	Oh, goody.
827092	827112	G4.
827172	827432	Yeah.
827852	830174	And the Clear Channel Music Group are putting this thing together.
831174	838159	It's going to be starting off with a July 6th show at the Hollywood Bowl, and it'll go on some other venues announced in Denver and Boston.
838579	846364	They'll be doing some music, playing Halo, Metal Gear Solid music, and then, interestingly enough, they also mention...
846784	850847	Donkey Kong, and Pong Pong didn't have music, did it?
851328	866859	I have no idea what they mean by music from Pong but it's in there, so go figure Also interesting to note, Final Fantasy will have its music played even though Final Fantasy is doing their own concert so I don't know if they had the license or whatever they're doing They're being sneaky
867426	875372	But also, they're going to say, not only is it the orchestra playing the music, but choirs and laser shows and footage of games.
875512	876773	Freaking laser shows.
878174	880516	Oh, goody, laser shows.
880936	885980	It'll be like, you ever been to one of those shows where they play Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon to Wizard of Oz?
886240	886720	No.
886780	887501	Freaking lasers.
888061	890223	Are they ill-tempered video games?
893211	894432	Anyway, so that should be interesting.
894552	896093	Do you guys have any interest in checking this out?
896273	900376	I know I'm going to the Final Fantasy concert, as is Loki, the more friends.
900576	902637	Does this sound like something we ought to be getting tickets for, too?
903518	905479	No, I'm going to the art show, thank you.
906660	909742	And then I'm going clubbing, and then I'm getting some chicken and waffles.
910863	913204	No, but this is something that's touring the country.
913244	914105	It's not just E3.
914585	919889	So that being said, is it something... Hypothetically, if this came to San Francisco, would you go?
920389	920509	No.
920829	921550	If somebody drives me.
922588	925851	I would not go because Tommy Talarco is attached to it.
926251	930134	Tommy Talarco for me is like Bobby Flay on the goddamn Food Network.
930414	933837	And for anyone that knows me, you know how much I hate Bobby Flay.
934178	939062	I will actually sit there and watch Bobby Flay's show and scowl at him the entire time.
939422	942484	Even though he can't see me through the TV, but I will do it anyways.
943165	946428	And I friggin' hate him because he's a little whiny bastard.
946868	947529	And guess what?
947569	950231	Tommy Talarco is a little whiny bastard just as well.
950311	951612	He is the Bobby Flay
952375	953816	MTV Movie Awards
979712	983575	Now, you might be thinking, what the heck do movie awards have to do with video games?
983715	987878	Well, I don't know, it's just like, what the heck does music have to do with MTV anymore?
988418	989078	Good question.
989479	994062	Well, MTV Music Awards, I'm sorry, the Movie Awards will be adding a category.
994602	997244	Best Video Game Based on a Movie.
998184	999065	That is great.
999885	1006890	The nominees for Best Video Game Based on a Movie, Spider-Man 2, Chronicles of Riddick, Escape from Butcher Bay,
1007523	1008744	Harry Potter and the Prisoner
1029807	1030167	Geeks.
1030447	1032247	Absolute Harry Potter geeks.
1032808	1034308	Not that that's bad, I'm just saying, they're geeks.
1034428	1039309	I only bought one Harry Potter game, and it was awful, but it seemed like it was based more off the book than off the movie.
1040069	1041289	I was not a fan of the Quidditch game.
1041309	1043949	Why isn't Grand Theft Auto nominated?
1044490	1047010	Because it's best video game based on a movie.
1047850	1051931	Vice City was based on Miami Vice, a TV show.
1052051	1056952	Well, it was based on Miami Vice, and it was also based on... Oh, God.
1056972	1057012	Um...
1060222	1061763	Al Pacino movie.
1061863	1062343	Scarface?
1062543	1065564	Scarface, yeah, exactly.
1065664	1067485	I think, unfortunately, it's a little bit of a stretch.
1067805	1068445	Oh, darn.
1068965	1072987	Thankfully, they didn't do best movie based on a video game.
1073387	1077188	Maybe they were going to try and do it, but then they realized, gee, what came out this year?
1078029	1080830	Alone in the Dark, Resident Evil Apocalypse.
1082390	1082970	What's the other one?
1083050	1084531	Was there another one?
1085311	1086492	The island one, Alone in the Dark.
1086512	1087112	Alone in the Dark.
1089144	1092345	And then they thought, we really want to give an award to one of these crappy games?
1092365	1093405	Please do not.
1093705	1096846	I don't want to hear an award winning Alone in the Dark.
1097006	1098146	Yeah, that would be horrible.
1098366	1098586	No.
1098866	1099626	No, we don't need that, man.
1099646	1100727	I'm making any more movies.
1101607	1106288	Speaking of movies, what do you think about this, Loki?
1106328	1109349	The PSP UMD format has been cracked.
1110169	1113530	You can now read the files off of the UMD disks for the PSP.
1114170	1118731	And this is, let's see, coming off a story that actually Engadget ran.
1119626	1120848	Um, that they did this.
1120948	1122890	And now ISO's popping up all over the internet.
1122990	1123331	What do you think?
1123351	1124912	Yeah, there's three of them.
1125012	1127776	There's, um, Wipeout, the USA version.
1127856	1129738	There's Ridge Racer, the Japanese version.
1129758	1135324	And then there's some other tower of some... Vampire Chronicles.
1135464	1136506	Vampire Chronicles, yeah.
1137507	1137587	Uh...
1138513	1140555	I already have the ISO for the white belt.
1140575	1141816	Yeah, but what can you do with it?
1141856	1146960	Because the USDs are in those little case things and you can't really burn... It was kind of smart what Sony did there.
1147040	1148261	I bet they did it just to combat piracy.
1148281	1150082	Well, here's what you can do with it, okay?
1150102	1151403	Oh, okay.
1151443	1156267	You can take the files and try the reverse engineering, which is going to be close to impossible.
1156728	1163353	You can rip some of the, like... I'm sure some of the graphics from it, but that's really useless crap anyways, you know?
1164177	1173661	You can look at... There are individual files in there that... They're basically these files called ELF files or whatever.
1175161	1180443	They're basically like executables or whatever, and you can probably try to create something out of that.
1180663	1185285	Basically, the whole reason I think that they ripped Wipeout is because they're looking for the web browser.
1185805	1186806	Wasn't ELF a band?
1188286	1188706	Forget it.
1189066	1191207	That was ELO, Electric Light Orchestra.
1192208	1193188	Maybe I'm thinking EMF.
1193868	1194268	Nevermind.
1194468	1194888	Whatever.
1195108	1195468	Anyways.
1195969	1198109	But, this is just a step.
1198209	1219634	I mean, because later on this week, actually, or last week, I should say, right after this story came out, they actually announced that they had run code on the Japanese PSP, the version 1.0, because all the US ones are shipped version 1.5, where the whole is covered.
1219714	1222435	But basically, this guy who actually has one of the...
1224737	1233321	One of the development kits, he created his own Hello World program and it runs off of a memory card.
1235742	1237342	Any other interesting hack stories going on?
1239103	1241284	Yes, the Nintendo DS.
1241824	1250527	We've been saying it, and there's actually the joke out there about installing Linux on Dead Badger, but now it's Linux for the DS.
1251048	1251888	That's right.
1252288	1253609	They have successfully...
1255063	1260185	Booted a kernel on there, and for those who don't know, that's like the operating system type thing.
1260605	1267669	And we're actually running this shell called Sash, and simple text games are on there.
1267749	1273411	So, you know, all those old, like, you know, things, Zork or whatever, you know, that type of thing.
1274452	1278153	But, yeah, there's information on that on themodgods.com.
1278193	1279714	They have a whole thing on it, and...
1280373	1281834	I don't really follow the Linux thing.
1281995	1286098	That would only be cool if Zork was one of the text games that they ported.
1286619	1289301	Then I might consider... They have Zork as a 404 message.
1290823	1291844	I don't know, but anyways.
1291864	1294106	Yeah, that's what's going on there.
1294406	1305116	I think it'll be cool just because you can do an actual soft keyboard on there using the touchscreen versus trying to type on the...
1306139	1307580	PSP is just crap.
1334787	1336288	Only one game cart needed.
1336848	1337588	So that's kind of neat.
1338509	1348574	Because there are eight players, they'll actually use both DS screens during the game to kind of spread things out a little bit because it might get kind of crowded with eight people on one screen.
1349094	1352195	So it should be interesting.
1352395	1355237	Hopefully it can restore my faith in the DS a little bit.
1355277	1355617	We'll see.
1355897	1359519	If it's anywhere near as cool as Super Bomberman 2 was, I'll have it.
1360139	1361860	June 21st is the date we'll find out.
1363911	1381359	Alright, let's go ahead and let DarkSakura present her advice column because, you know, we here at Orange Lounge Radio, we're not just here to talk about games, but we're also here to better your life because if we talked about video games all the time, we'd have no time to go out and get our hair did.
1381759	1384821	So, DarkSakura, it's your turn to give us your advice column.
1385101	1387562	What are you going to talk to us about tonight, my friend?
1388615	1391137	Today's advice is how to treat a severed limb.
1392278	1397422	Number one, locate any individual bleeding arteries on the stump.
1397922	1399723	Two, pinch off the large arteries.
1400504	1402025	Three, apply a tourniquet.
1402425	1408610	Choose a strip of material at least an inch wide, tie it around the stump as close to the end as possible so it will not fall off when tightened.
1409251	1412293	Tie it moderately tight, tighten just enough to stop most of the bleeding.
1412393	1413474	Keep pinching the arteries.
1414535	1417517	Four, tie off the ends of any blood vessels being pinched.
1418098	1423519	Use fishing line, dental floss, or heavy thread and a sewing needle if available to carefully tie off arteries.
1424319	1423519	5.
1424459	1425539	Clean the stump thoroughly.
1426539	1425539	6.
1426840	1427720	Loosen the tourniquet.
1428360	1430720	As pressure from the tourniquet decreases, check your ties.
1431180	1433481	If bleeding is just moderate, you can remove the tourniquet.
1433901	1438261	In order to preserve tissue at the stump, do not leave a tourniquet applied for more than 90 minutes.
1439122	1438261	7.
1439442	1440202	Dress the stump.
1440662	1445023	Tightly cover the end of the stump with clean cloth or gauze.
1445683	1447343	Now my final advice though... Yes?
1448950	1450310	Stop playing with those branch cutters.
1454793	1456334	Clean the stump thoroughly.
1457134	1461056	Well, yeah, you don't want any, you know, axe shavings on it or something.
1461276	1461416	Ew.
1461837	1463057	Or chainsaw oil.
1464878	1468580	Ew, now I'm thinking about the end of Fargo, and I'm getting all grossed.
1468660	1472923	I've never seen that, but, you know, they had on a... Well, I just wrote it for you, but it's all right.
1472943	1473863	Like I'll ever see it.
1474243	1476985	But, you know, they had on the Darwin Awards.
1477711	1483098	There was two guys, brothers, and they had this bright idea that one would cut off the other's leg with a chainsaw.
1483158	1483839	Hilarious!
1484420	1485061	Well, of course he died.
1486563	1489466	But if he had heard your advice, maybe he wouldn't have died.
1490648	1491369	Nah, I doubt it.
1491409	1495895	He cut through a major artery in the leg, and that's one of the ones that's like cutting one in your neck.
1497062	1499183	I was just trying to promote your column over here.
1499243	1501804	I know, but I still don't like stupid people to breed.
1502585	1504986	Really, your column will do no good for stupid people.
1505406	1508627	This is how to preserve the lives of intelligent people.
1510168	1513029	Let's talk about another big story that was going on in the gaming world.
1513490	1517452	Namco has merged with Bandai.
1517592	1521433	Bandai has bought Japanese developer and publisher Namco.
1522234	1522954	Very interesting.
1523034	1524755	It's going to be named the new company
1525160	1550443	Namco Bandai Holdings and it is official as of September 29th 2005 and I believe this makes them the third largest don't quote me on that third largest gaming company well you know this also means that means that what we get out of this is a new Dragon Ball Z game with the Tekken 5 engine be interesting but I don't know I always thought maybe this is me personally maybe I'm just not
1550956	1554338	Giving enough respect to Bandai, but I always kind of preferred what Namco put out.
1554378	1557879	So I'm a little sad that Bandai bought Namco and not the other way around.
1557979	1560280	If you play imports, though, it's all about Bandai.
1561101	1563102	They put out all the DBZ games.
1563662	1568204	Bon Presto put out this game that it's a lot like Guardian Heroes.
1569685	1572606	Maybe that's what it is, because I play some imports, but I don't play a lot.
1572686	1573426	You know what this means?
1574767	1579089	That in the next Tekken game, you might have a hidden character that is Hello Kitty.
1580540	1581021	That's true.
1581301	1583786	You may have Goku in Tekken.
1584427	1588295	If we could have Gon in Tekken 3, just think about it.
1588315	1589617	I'm not going to hold my breath for help.
1589637	1590639	That's Maru in Tekken 5.
1590719	1590820	That
1593800	1595121	Hello Kitty Fighting Game.
1595162	1597223	The concept kind of scares me a little.
1597383	1598464	I think it would be awesome.
1598484	1599845	They really need to do that.
1599865	1601326	It would just be cool.
1601547	1604989	I choose Twinkle Twinkle Twinkle Twin Stars.
1605110	1610554	No, what would be great is to do the Hello Kitty Fighting Game and make it as violent as like Tekken 5 or something.
1611054	1615078	The Twin Stars would be about as effective as the Ice Climbers in Smash Bros.
1615118	1617800	Melee and everybody hates playing the Ice Climbers.
1617840	1619541	I don't know anybody that enjoys playing the Ice Climbers.
1619561	1619681	No way.
1619701	1621763	Dan plays the Ice Climbers and he's awesome with them.
1621923	1625805	Well, he's a freak of nature or something because nobody's good with the ice climbers.
1625905	1627746	We have ice climbers on our nest.
1628987	1629987	Oh, dude, that game was awesome.
1630027	1630468	Don't get me wrong.
1630788	1631028	All right.
1632529	1644735	If you guys have any feedback on our show, you want to write us and tell us that you are an ice climbers player, I don't know, send us an email, togo, T-O-G-O, at orangeloungeradio.com, and we might read some of your letters on the show.
1645154	1652703	Now one thing that we have been getting in the mailbox is that we have been getting a lot of response from folks overseas actually.
1653003	1653664	Yes we have.
1655085	1661613	Actually as a result now we're going to start covering a little bit more of the UK Europe news for them.
1662921	1663941	So let's start it off.
1664361	1667762	DarkSakura, you have agreed to kind of head up the UK scene.
1667782	1669403	So what's going on for our friends overseas?
1669523	1678625	Well, first and foremost, because I know there's been an issue of debate because for a while there was one thing being said by Sony and Amazon had a different date for the release dates of the PSP.
1679065	1681506	Now both of them are completely in sync.
1681886	1684087	The PSP will be available for £179 on 1st of September.
1689189	1704498	It's going to be a value pack that consists of the system, a pouch, 32MB memory stick, duo, a battery pack, headphones with remote control, AC adapter, wrist strap, cloth, and a sampler disc.
1704818	1713182	You can also go to yrpsp.com and order a copy of Spider-Man 2 that will be shipped to you for free.
1713202	1715664	That's an interesting way of doing it.
1715764	1715964	Okay.
1716508	1718771	Amazon UK is taking pre-orders at £179.
1718891	1720534	I also do have a few release dates for GameCube.
1726910	1733734	This month, coming up on the 20th, we have Fairly OddParents Shadow Showdown, an Animaniacs game with an announced date.
1733834	1735435	Dude, they're still making Animaniacs games?
1735495	1735976	I didn't know that.
1736276	1737316	I don't know why.
1737477	1738497	No one watches that anymore.
1738517	1741259	Is it even on TV anymore?
1741659	1742320	No.
1742420	1743080	Actually, yeah.
1743280	1744421	It must be big in Britain.
1744501	1745782	I don't know.
1745842	1754787	June 2005 for GameCube, Donkey Konga 2, Hit Song Parade, Medal of Honor, European Assault, Killer7, Batman Begins, and
1755230	1757392	Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six 4 Lockdown Bratz Rock Angels Prince of Persia 3 Closes Window
1776752	1785558	Next up on PC, we have Star Wars Galaxies Episode 3, Asheron's Call 2, that's on the 6th.
1786138	1790601	Coming up, Space Rangers Imperial Glory, Deep Sea Tycoon 2, Bard's Tale on the 27th.
1790641	1793063	Skip it.
1794004	1799487	And next month we've got Roller Coaster Tycoon, blah blah blah, and more blah blah blah blah blah.
1800208	1802129	And second quarter, ER the game.
1802429	1803950	And Seven Sins is coming out.
1804338	1806318	Seven Sins is coming out, yes indeed.
1806439	1808339	Wait, but she's reading the British chart right now.
1808399	1810119	That's coming out there too.
1810159	1811000	Seven Sins.
1811680	1818321	This game has a mini-game where you take the woman's nipples and they're actually the analog controls and you can play around with that.
1818801	1819722	It's awesome.
1820582	1821502	Okay, next up.
1821922	1823523	We have for the Nintendo DS.
1824243	1825683	The 5th we have Star Wars Episode 3.
1826543	1828904	We have Yoshi's Touch and Go on the 6th.
1828964	1829704	Pack Picks on the 20th.
1829724	1831144	Skip Yoshi's Touch and Go.
1831905	1833605	27th Need for Speed Underground 2.
1834355	1836937	June 2005, we've got another DS.
1837017	1837897	It's a temporary title.
1838478	1839558	Ultimate Card Games.
1840679	1842020	Anything else coming out good?
1842380	1843481	GoldenEye in July.
1843621	1845402	Bomberman DS on the 1st of July.
1846102	1848063	And August, Puyo Pot Fever.
1848904	1849684	Which just came out here.
1849844	1850025	Yeah.
1850885	1853166	Which I have to get, because I am a Puyo Puyo fangirl.
1853206	1855408	Now, see, this is the nice thing for you folks overseas.
1855488	1856989	Now, you know, whereas for us in...
1858290	1861851	Here in America, it's kind of interesting to hear the delay of games.
1861931	1869014	Unfortunately, sometimes we bitch and complain about how long games take to come over from Japan, but man, you're in Britain, you've got to wait for the PAL translation and everything.
1869034	1869574	It takes forever.
1870735	1877997	So we kind of get to hear about that, but it's kind of interesting if you're on the other side of it and you're in Britain listening to this, we can already tell you which games suck, so just skip them.
1878117	1880038	And I'm telling you, don't buy Polarium.
1880278	1880558	Don't.
1882219	1885460	Also, just to mention, Castlevania DS will be out third quarter.
1887932	1888692	for the PS2.
1888752	1891354	I'm just going to pick out the stuff that doesn't look really sucky.
1892194	1894356	Ghost of the Shell Standalone Complex on the 6th.
1894836	1898518	Tenchu, Fatal Shadows, Seven Sins, which we were just mentioning.
1899539	1902321	Alien Hominid for PS2 coming out on the 27th.
1902401	1903982	Hasn't that game been out here for like two years?
1904842	1906043	No, not even two years.
1906503	1908604	NARC is to be announced.
1909485	1915789	We have June 2005, Destroy All Humans, Batman Begins, Medal of Honor, Yu Yu Hakusho, Dark Tournament.
1916622	1922185	and King of Fighters Maximum Impact, which I'm actually going to be getting very soon because I like King of Fighters.
1924126	1943718	Last two sections to go, Xbox, Star Wars Episode 3, blah, blah, blah, Area 51, Alien Hominid, WrestleMania 21, next month, Capcom Fighting Jam, Destroy All Humans, Cold War, Conquer, Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, and...
1944708	1947249	Later on, there's going to be some worms.
1947929	1948270	Whatever.
1948990	1950190	You know, my fiance really liked worms.
1950250	1951351	Oh, yeah, there's Cricket 2005.
1952711	1953011	Awesome.
1953352	1954912	Yeah.
1955132	1959394	And, last but not least, on the Game Boy Advance, we have Kingdom Hearts Chain of Memories coming out.
1959994	1961055	Finally, you guys.
1961155	1961595	Get that.
1961855	1962215	Good job.
1962395	1963456	Herbie Fully Loaded.
1963476	1964636	Don't bother.
1964656	1965817	Which is, you know, Herbie Lovebug.
1966417	1967217	Koala Brothers.
1967617	1969018	Next month, WarioWare Twisted.
1970301	1980166	Mega Man Battle Network 5, Dragon Ball Z Advanced Adventures, Mario Party Advance, Batman Begins, July we have Fantastic Four, and coming up fourth quarter is Prince of Persia 3.
1980206	1985488	Oh, and they get the Shaman King eventually.
1986769	1988410	Alright.
1988530	1993492	Speaking though of our email, we actually did get some good email.
1993952	1998074	Lee wrote in and said that we make his LA drive a lot easier to deal with.
1998613	1999134	Oh, thank you.
1999354	1999834	Thank you very much.
2000615	2004738	And also heard from Tommy.
2004758	2009181	He says he enjoys our podcasts and that we hold his attention.
2009282	2018189	So, hey, if we can distract a gamer from the games just for long enough, that totally is awesome.
2018389	2018649	Yeah, great.
2018669	2019490	Thank you for writing in.
2019690	2020090	Thank you.
2020150	2021031	We appreciate the support.
2021071	2021671	You guys are awesome.
2021972	2022352	That's great.
2022901	2023021	XBOX 360
2043652	2071834	of course that MTV special is this week I probably won't be watching because we're lucky enough to get to go to E3 next week so we'll just check it out then honestly folks honestly they've made the console bigger it looks like a freaking PS2 but white it's white and virginal it is bigger it looks the size of now my Comcast receiver and that sucker
2072475	2073015	is huge.
2073176	2078080	I mean, that's like, this is like one and a half Xbox size-wise.
2079621	2083184	It's almost, it is almost the size of a PC case.
2084305	2084665	Alright.
2084985	2087147	Well, we'll see what happens with that.
2087227	2088268	Oh, and guess what?
2088548	2092071	They came up with a brand new original idea for a webcam.
2093172	2094533	My ad is very ugly.
2095273	2098336	And, um, their brand new controller, um,
2098993	2100574	Oh, that'd be kind of weird.
2100614	2100894	All right.
2115219	2115799	You know what?
2115819	2115879	Hmm.
2145504	2147209	It's ridiculous.
2147991	2154328	All this is is another example of parents not doing their damn jobs and expecting the government to do it for them.
2155417	2158438	That's the only reason this is going to pass is because they're lazy asses.
2158458	2160619	That's why we have censorship.
2160639	2163920	That's why the FCC is as rampant as it is these days.
2164380	2167861	It's because they do not want to take responsibility.
2168041	2177084	If you're going to breed a child, they need to make you sign a fucking contract that says, I am going to raise my child and have some type of control over what they do.
2178284	2179665	That's what being a parent is.
2179765	2182025	It's not about lobbying the government to do it for you.
2182366	2183606	That's called being fucking lazy.
2184520	2206913	I don't have a, I don't know, I'm like, I totally see that point of it, and I'm not saying this is something that, like, needs to happen, but it's kind of one of those things where it's like, it doesn't totally bug me because, you know, we shouldn't sell violent video games to minors, but why do, it's, yeah, I think you're right where the parents have to really have a more active role in what their minors are buying, really.
2208927	2218435	I think having the rating system is good because then you're giving them a way to understand what type of game it is that they're purchasing for their child.
2218455	2221017	But I find it very interesting that they will pass a law for this.
2221117	2236689	However, they've never passed a law that says a movie theater must make sure that there is a child 17 or when a child 17 or younger is coming in that there is a guardian with them or they will be arrested because that crap happens all the time where kids get into R-rated movies.
2237582	2238923	Why are you picking on the video game industry?
2238983	2239283	I don't know.
2239723	2243525	Maybe there is a law on the books, but you and I know nobody enforces that law.
2243765	2245686	When we were kids, we got narrated movies all the time.
2246306	2254190	But the thing is, and this actually is directly affecting my life, because my fiance manages a GameStop.
2255691	2266416	What if some kid comes in and one of his employees sells the game and then it gets back to GameStop corporate when their parent raises a big fit on it and they fire him as the manager?
2267529	2272994	Yeah, it's just... You know, this is just more of a case of people sticking their nose where it doesn't belong.
2273495	2277899	You know, if you want to stick your nose somewhere, shove it right back up your ass where it's been for the last 50 years.
2278780	2280542	That's a very passionate subject for you.
2281403	2281763	All right.
2282704	2284265	We'll probably get some emails on that one.
2284305	2284686	Good job.
2284746	2285046	All right.
2285226	2287068	I welcome emails on that, okay?
2287248	2288690	All right, just... I want...
2289272	2290653	to hear from your parents.
2291113	2295114	And I will tell them exactly how I feel and why they're being retards.
2295374	2296695	Happy Mother's Day, by the way.
2296995	2298175	Yeah, happy Mother's Day.
2299296	2299536	All right.
2300956	2304318	Let's move on to just a couple of last stories here.
2304458	2307019	EverQuest 2 is expanding.
2307039	2311300	There's a brand new expansion pack coming out called Desert of Flames.
2311660	2315862	Ooh, 40 new creatures, 12 new zones, and you can advance to level 60.
2316778	2317398	and DarkSakura.
2347066	2347406	DarkSakura
2366880	2372262	We've talked about import gaming, especially on our live three-hour program that we have Sunday nights over on OrangeLawsRadio.com.
2373183	2379925	We've talked about places where you should buy import games and places where you should not buy import games because we're into import gaming.
2380425	2383387	What types of sites on the Internet would you recommend?
2383727	2386248	And keep in mind we're not being sponsored by anybody.
2386288	2387468	This is just personal opinion.
2388809	2389709	What sites would you recommend?
2390057	2392960	and NCSX, first and foremost, Japan Video Games.
2393380	2395062	PlayAsia's been decent to me.
2395122	2397083	I do know people who've had problems with them.
2398104	2400286	I actually have had good experience with Lixang, too.
2402108	2405030	But NCSX just sits at the top of them, of all of them.
2405431	2407953	Japan Video Games is another pretty good one.
2407973	2411256	That's where I ordered my Beatmania 2, my Drumania.
2411376	2414759	They're the only import company I've bought from, actually, and I don't have any complaints.
2414779	2415079	They're good.
2415340	2415460	Yeah.
2416021	2422745	Okay, but if you say there was one that you would never recommend to anybody and you would say, forget it, don't ever do this, what would you say?
2422985	2423365	Buy right.
2423686	2424006	And why?
2425346	2429009	They have stolen money from me, not delivered promised product.
2430069	2433451	I ordered, and I specified, Japanese Tekken 4.
2433972	2438454	They sent me the Asian release, and then when I emailed them, it says, we didn't make any such promise.
2438854	2439735	Well, guess what?
2440575	2451058	The Better Business Bureau and the North Carolina Attorney General's Office have taken action against Buy Right Video Games and they have closed their doors and ceased operations as a result.
2451398	2451958	Woo-hoo!
2452818	2458280	Buy Right Video Games, of course, sold used antique and imported games and they were doing refurbished systems and stuff.
2458600	2464301	But it's interesting because if you check out the website fatwallet.com, a bunch of people were just complaining about this.
2464341	2469943	They've been complaining about just what Jamie said there, bad service, misrepresenting themselves, and stealing your money.
2470905	2475509	So one quote said that they ordered a Saturn and it was cracked.
2475829	2477070	Soul Calibur didn't work.
2477590	2478051	Crazy.
2479272	2480753	Better Business Bureau says this.
2481233	2489480	Based on BBB files, this company has an unsatisfactory record due to unanswered complaints concerning delivery problems and product dissatisfaction.
2489840	2494744	The Bureau has processed 414 complaints about this company in the last 36 months.
2495024	2495725	Are you one of those?
2496403	2497504	Yep.
2497784	2500346	No, I actually never got my thing to the Better Business Bureau.
2500746	2502087	I have the letter prepared.
2503268	2509932	I'm actually hoping that they are doing a class action lawsuit because I'm going to get in on that.
2511093	2512454	Well, this is interesting, too, is that
2513276	2527327	On April 12th, the North Carolina Attorney General's Office told Buy Right Video Games basically to request that they do not take orders, inform customers of the business status, and they have to provide a telephone number for customers to contact them in case of complaints.
2527748	2528468	Well, guess what?
2528989	2532351	They didn't comply because as of April 26th, they shut them down.
2532912	2533172	Good.
2533632	2534032	Interesting.
2534132	2535694	So we say, good riddance.
2535994	2537275	I want to email them and gloat.
2539753	2541734	So that's going to do it for another podcast.
2541774	2545615	Any parting words from Loki over there, who's been kind of quiet this last bit of show?
2545755	2549896	What was the thing about the two guys that were making movies?
2550076	2552997	Oh, I ended up skipping that because we were running long, but I'll mention it real quick.
2553037	2556259	Clive Barker, John Woo, getting together to do this project.
2556319	2557339	It's called Demonic.
2557859	2563361	And basically what it is, they're going to be simultaneously doing a next-gen console game and film.
2563851	2564251	Silent Hill Movie
2593459	2593939	That's fine.
2594039	2594259	All right.
2594299	2594719	Parting words?
2596280	2596920	It's hot in here.
2597380	2598321	All right.
2598421	2598921	DarkSakura?
2600762	2601642	Reject false icons.
2602142	2606964	And my parting words are visit the website, orangelaunchradio.com, and subscribe to the podcast.
