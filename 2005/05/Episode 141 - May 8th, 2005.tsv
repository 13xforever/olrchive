477927	479508	In this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm.
479569	480910	Say hello to Miss Jamie Summers.
480950	482391	You know her better as Dark Sakura.
482931	486394	I wouldn't say I'm the happiest bunny on the farm today, but I'm pretty damn happy.
487955	491317	You're kind of a... I'm the most carnivorous bunny on the farm.
492018	492658	Alright, fair enough.
493559	495861	I've been eating nothing but meat all day and I feel violent.
496940	499221	You're not going to hurt anything during this show, are you?
499581	500721	No, I'll wait until after the show.
500801	502302	You wouldn't hurt a ferret, would you?
502362	503982	Give me a ferret!
504342	504862	Hey, baby.
507083	509584	Also joining us, say hello to the one, the only, Loki.
510444	514065	Also remember, it's the most motherly, you know, read.
514165	515425	I was going to get there.
515645	516525	I was going to get there.
516545	517686	Hey, just saying.
518666	524928	I did that stuff yesterday because, you know, I don't want to interfere with today, you know, my sleeping and going to fries and whatnot.
525328	525628	Now, just
526474	529657	Take a moment to thank the womb where you were cooked.
533439	534860	You don't have to think about it that way if you don't want to.
534901	537623	Anyway, also joining us tonight, we have some special guests.
537663	542166	Say hello to somebody who was at the show a couple months ago, but he's back tonight.
542326	542907	Say hello to...
543843	544743	I don't know how to introduce you.
544763	545784	Toadie?
545844	546424	Pirate Power?
546464	546724	I don't know.
546744	547465	What do we call you?
547505	552407	You could call me... I guess go by Toadie because that's what I'm on on like all 70,000 forums I'm on.
552607	553307	Alright, Toadie.
553407	553847	How are you?
554968	556088	I think I'm getting sick.
556148	557389	Everybody I know is sick.
557429	558529	Get the hell away from me.
558889	561190	I'm a good four feet, so I think we're good.
561631	561991	I know.
562011	566893	We're in the news studio now, though, so it's all... I could reach out and hug everyone right now in this news studio.
568214	575196	You can check out the new webcam over at www.orange.com Of course, the only person you can see is me right now, but we'll try to get it around.
576016	579638	Also, say hello to, and there's a reason you're here tonight, Tony.
579858	580118	Yes.
580158	582258	And we're going to talk about that when we get into the show.
582278	583019	Sounds good.
583079	587100	I mean, we like having you here for no reason in particular, but tonight you have a very specific reason for being here.
587220	587480	Okay.
587580	587740	Yes.
587840	588720	I'll try not to let you down.
588901	589161	All right.
589401	591501	And also joining us tonight, say hello to Bug.
592142	592482	Hello.
593562	594322	And how are you, sir?
595303	596643	I'm doing great, sir.
598674	610280	Our resident tech geek bugged, because then when you get tech guru Loki and tech geek bugged in the same room, it's just, I don't know, it's just all... It's like a board collective.
610320	612342	Yeah, it's 20 degrees of dork in here right now.
612842	616184	Anyway, all sorts of interesting things we're going to talk about on tonight's show.
617504	625329	I got to check out that In The Groove premiere party, so I definitely want to talk about that, and of course the reason Toadie's here, he went to it too, so...
626368	631251	Unfortunately, DarkSakura and Loki were unable to make it, so somebody's going to be so unfortunate.
633292	634333	Well, we'll get into that later.
634613	638635	So the question is, have I been swayed on in the group?
639176	640937	I've been on the fence for a long time.
640997	642878	So the question is, have I been swayed on in the group?
642898	643859	And what do I think of the home version?
644259	644699	We'll see.
644919	645340	We'll see.
646320	649362	Also, so much news going on in the Mamani world.
650322	651683	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
672498	680001	Starting this break, I figured since we're going to be talking about Extreme 2 at some point tonight, we should play some music from the first DDR Extreme that was released in the US.
680041	684062	So here's some music, and we'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.
684282	684602	See you then.
702057	702978	Thanks for watching!
793486	796527	New Sky 2 Forever, the green grass blows and the wind is dancing
815843	827272	It would be a much better sight with you with me If you hadn't met me, I'd be fine on my own, baby Never felt so lonely when you came along
834877	837079	So now what should I do?
837199	851691	I'm strung out, addicted to you My body aches, now that you're gone My supplies fell through Glad they gave me everything you had and more You craved my happiness When you made me feel joy and made you smile
862546	863809	Thank you for watching!
909421	915523	I was into Cuba, now I'm stuck Diving, knowing it was you I keep on trying
971999	994468	Looking out a dirty old window Down below the cars in the city go rushing by I sit here alone and I wonder why Friday night and everyone I can feel the heat but it's soothing heading down I saw
1030680	1031581	Thanks for watching!
1078743	1083143	Hi, we're back with Orange Lounge Radio.
1083524	1085584	In that break, you heard some Kids in America.
1085644	1087304	Before that, Four Strings with Diving.
1087704	1091125	Heather, You're Not Here, originally famous in Silent Hill 3, but then you got to dance to it.
1091205	1094146	And then Funk Boogie, all from DDR Extreme USA.
1095376	1096357	DarkSakra My week has been...
1123149	1123709	Interesting.
1125330	1129472	I've basically been in a lot of pain all week, but most of it doped up on Vicodin.
1130572	1130812	Woohoo!
1131412	1131953	And Flexerol.
1131993	1133593	Not woohoo for pain, but woohoo for Vicodin.
1133813	1135234	Yeah.
1135474	1138355	I've managed to go two days until today without taking any Vicodin.
1139616	1142517	And then I started to hurt really bad again, so I took some more.
1143777	1145818	But it was all just work, school crap.
1146118	1152181	I was going to go to the end of the group thing, and instead said that I can get out of my final, which is the first day of E3.
1153747	1158208	I gave up going to the in-the-group thing because my education is more important.
1158608	1159509	Listen to all of this.
1159649	1161949	Your education is more important than video games.
1163950	1164470	Ignorant people.
1165510	1172232	Well, now, what if you're going to go to one of those schools that you see in the G4 commercial that, you know, learn about how to play games for a living.
1172292	1173372	Games, games, games, games, games.
1175553	1175933	No comment.
1176273	1177053	Okay.
1179034	1179294	But...
1181656	1181876	What?
1181916	1182016	What?
1182036	1182136	What?
1182156	1182236	What?
1204816	1211400	and then went to Rapture, which was basically goth industrial and had a really good time.
1212221	1215303	I see a little bit of that reflected in your pre-show selections for this evening.
1215343	1216423	It was a little bit angsty.
1216904	1217084	No.
1217144	1219125	I wouldn't say angsty, but more it was tragic.
1219285	1220846	Your playlist was tragic.
1221046	1222467	I had some Britpop in there.
1222987	1224328	A little bit, but it was tragic Britpop.
1225329	1226209	How is it tragic?
1226289	1227090	I'm just messing with you.
1228920	1231101	I don't see how Pet Shop Boys gets very tragic.
1231361	1233662	Well, yeah, they do have some kind of angsty stuff.
1233682	1236524	Because a guy whines when he sings.
1239185	1246568	Anyway, I've been in a good mood since then, except Friday I heard back from the other guy's insurance company.
1247048	1248849	Well, that taxi cab company's insurance company.
1249169	1252311	Tried to call the stupid guy back because he left a message on my voicemail.
1252351	1254732	And this relates to your car accident from a couple weeks ago, for those who missed it.
1255249	1257310	and he never called me back.
1257390	1264354	He apparently never came back to his desk and I need the money so if they flat out refuse to pay me, I'm suing them.
1265755	1268776	I've already talked about getting an accident attorney.
1269637	1272038	And you know me, I will rip them.
1272498	1273819	Coming soon to Court TV.
1274159	1274659	Seriously.
1275019	1277101	But no, I'm going to give them... Take them on Judge Judy.
1277481	1277621	No.
1279652	1282174	See, I have this thing called A Sense of Pride.
1282294	1283515	Okay, how about Texas Justice?
1286018	1286838	Don't even go there.
1287979	1290161	Have you ever watched Texas Justice?
1290922	1291623	I don't watch TV.
1291923	1293645	Is that where the loser gets hanged?
1294666	1296707	I think they play it just before cops.
1298449	1301732	And you can just tell what the target audience is for this power hour.
1303073	1303734	Anyway, sorry.
1304555	1304675	No.
1305861	1307423	But I'm going to give him a fair opportunity.
1307483	1310125	I'm going to get a copy of the police report, have it full out.
1313469	1319516	There's no way they really can't pay me because he was fully at fault, you know, pulled out in front of me when I had the right of way.
1320096	1323500	I wasn't on my cell phone and my headlights were on so there's nothing they can do.
1325657	1325777	Ouch.
1325797	1325877	Yeah.
1353524	1355485	They didn't give me Vicodin, then they gave me Codeine.
1356966	1358387	That sounded like I was drunk for days.
1359168	1364111	But, um... But, uh... I had a lot of fun yesterday.
1364291	1368534	I completely went off my diet and had fish and chips, and then I had ice cream, and then went to Hot Topic.
1369195	1370095	I'm sorry, Instagoth.
1370976	1371856	To do some shopping.
1373718	1375699	Beer's... It was pretty good.
1375719	1377160	Cider.
1377180	1377500	Cider.
1377940	1379221	That's... What was that stuff called?
1379341	1380082	That apple cider.
1380882	1381123	That was, uh...
1382810	1383751	Blackthorn Dry Cider
1398448	1418580	and today I did my homework for my technical writing class I have to write a tutorial and actually the whole tutorial is not due for two weeks I have to review somebody else's tutorial but I'm just going to do everything at once but my tutorial is on how to make live journal icons using PaintShark Pro 8 are you going to post that on the interweb for anybody to see when it's done?
1418921	1425545	sure, why not I'm hopefully going to have it finished by the end of the week and I'll put it up on the web you can see my homework
1426383	1427344	and tomorrow I get to paint.
1427604	1427724	Cool.
1427744	1428964	I was supposed to do it today, but eh.
1429805	1435928	I went to bed at 4 a.m., sorry, 4.30 in the morning and got up at half past noon, so yeah.
1437589	1437869	Okay, done.
1438409	1438629	All right.
1439410	1441191	Let's move on to Loki.
1441671	1442571	Loki, sir, how was your week?
1442611	1443072	How was your day?
1443172	1443872	Put down the luminous.
1444192	1445053	Hey, okay, okay.
1445613	1447394	I'm getting further now that I actually have time to play.
1448575	1449695	No, my day was okay.
1449775	1453117	I went to Fry's to buy a bunch of supplies for my
1454777	1456238	We'll get into that stuff later.
1457678	1462281	Fry's rocks, but I try not to go there too much because I spend too much money.
1463342	1467485	And then I went to a movie this week.
1467545	1471227	I went and saw Kingdom of Heaven, and that was Kingdom of Boring.
1471648	1473649	It looked like Kingdom of Boring from the trailer.
1473689	1474870	I can't believe you actually went.
1474910	1479173	This was Father-Son time, so I went because he wanted to see the movie.
1479473	1482875	Did it have any true historical reference to it?
1483487	1483867	It did.
1484147	1487128	Apparently the fighting, everything but the fighting was accurate.
1487748	1488488	Okay, I have to see it.
1489608	1496570	But really, it's just like, it was like, I've never actually sat through a movie where I said, okay, is it over yet?
1496950	1500010	Because it just kept going and I really wanted it to end.
1500050	1501871	The battles were anticlimactic.
1502351	1508932	I mean, I can sense that Ridley Scott was trying to make it climactic, but it was just a
1509687	1510708	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1529966	1531287	Anything else is happening, you know.
1531487	1534428	My friend won free passes to see the Kingdom of Heaven.
1534488	1538190	She actually entered an amateur strip contest, and that was part of the prize that she won.
1538250	1538870	Go figure.
1539370	1540111	Poor bastard.
1540691	1541771	Is that punishment or something?
1541871	1542452	I don't know.
1542472	1545153	It was like, you should know better than taking your clothes off in public.
1545393	1546573	You have to go see Kingdom of Heaven.
1546754	1549515	I think I want to see it, though, just because I'm a big history nut.
1549795	1550495	You know, it's too bad.
1550875	1553677	She had those advanced screening passes, and she was like, I don't want to go.
1553997	1556458	So she tried to give them to me, and I was like, I don't want to go.
1557349	1557789	E3 Oh, that's fair.
1586300	1587941	Oh, I got a free game, another one, Area 51, and I have not played it.
1614573	1616233	and Contemplating Selling.
1616333	1622655	Yes, Area 51's been remade again, but this time it's not a shooting game, it's a first-person shooter.
1622995	1625215	Oh, just what we need, another first-person shooting game.
1625976	1626536	I'm so happy.
1626716	1632177	Oh, honestly, yeah, there's like so many goddamn first-person shooters out there, it's not even funny, but whatever.
1632337	1637298	So, yeah, that's pretty much all I've been doing, and just, you know, cleaning house and stuff.
1638874	1639314	Fun stuff.
1639454	1641715	I got to play Final Fantasy online the other day.
1642035	1642635	So it's finally.
1643315	1643635	Finally.
1643675	1644015	That's good.
1644035	1646516	I've been, like, having withdrawals.
1647736	1648076	Very cool.
1649436	1649676	All right.
1650036	1650396	Addict.
1652317	1654577	My week and my day was okay.
1654797	1657418	I was kind of busy this weekend because a friend of mine was in town.
1657438	1658078	And you know what's funny?
1658118	1665380	Because we went to GameStop the other night, and he had, like, $100 worth of credit that he could turn in to buy stuff.
1665400	1666600	He just had it lying around.
1666640	1666920	I don't know.
1667219	1670440	I don't know how you just happen to have $100 worth of credit just lying around.
1670520	1671001	Oh, look here.
1671341	1674282	But no, he decided he wanted to get a PSP.
1674982	1677723	And I was like, if you're going to get a PSP, you have to buy Luminous.
1678363	1685386	But I think he was kind of starting to realize that when you get a PSP, not only do you have to start buying the PSP, then you've got to buy a memory stick, then you've got to buy a game.
1685486	1687107	And it really starts to add up pretty quickly.
1687127	1689648	You're not going to throw down $250 when you first get a PSP.
1689668	1691329	You're going to end up throwing down more like $300 or $350.
1692785	1698069	So he decided he wanted to get Darkstalkers, and lucky him, he actually found a used PSP.
1698509	1702572	Somebody had just traded it in that morning, so he ended up getting one of those, so lucky him.
1702752	1710338	And it appeared to be in great shape, and it already had like a memory stick in it that was like 200-something megs, so it was kind of nice.
1710718	1711138	That's not bad.
1711158	1713280	You know the one gigs are supposed to be out at GameStop.
1713640	1717042	It was like about the best one you can get, so he got a really sweet deal on that.
1717943	1720765	But anyway, the point is that I was like, you have to play Luminous.
1721158	1722438	But he was like, I don't really have the money.
1722458	1723299	So I'm like, okay, you know what?
1723319	1724319	I'm going to get a PSP eventually.
1724379	1725279	I'm just going to buy Luminous.
1725700	1729021	So now I have a copy of Luminous with no system to play it on because he took it home with him.
1730861	1731842	So, oh well.
1732982	1734262	I figure I'll get a PSP eventually.
1734282	1736023	I just have to wait for the E3 stuff to settle down.
1736043	1736623	So we'll see what happens.
1737203	1739684	Otherwise, my week was just really busy with work.
1740584	1745726	I'm looking forward to next week and E3 and everything just so I can take my mind off my real job.
1746466	1748407	Not that I dislike my real job because I love my job, but
1749011	1751312	I'm looking forward to playing with this job for a little while.
1751452	1751872	It'll be fun.
1752492	1752932	And that's it.
1752972	1754272	I'll talk about the rest of my week in a little bit.
1755233	1756473	Let's talk to Toadie.
1756553	1757973	What's up with your week and your day?
1759394	1760114	Well, let's see.
1760154	1763415	First of all, I was driving around about half the day without my wallet.
1763455	1766076	That was really fun because I didn't know where the hell I left that.
1766156	1769837	I thought it might have been in some Mexican restaurant in like West Sacramento.
1770077	1771277	So that kind of freaked me out.
1772998	1773778	Oh, that place is good.
1774058	1774578	Yeah.
1775336	1776297	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1804980	1806181	So I was like, hell with that!
1806621	1808322	And you love children, right?
1808582	1811363	Roseville Golf Land teaches you how to be a real good babysitter.
1811463	1812244	Oh yes, yes.
1812304	1816406	I actually have a group of little kids down there that want to kick my ass.
1816566	1817426	It's really funny.
1819107	1821489	Children are fine with the proper preparation and sauces.
1821889	1822129	Yes.
1823567	1824948	Get some basil going on there.
1824968	1825728	Wait, wait, wait.
1826008	1827028	You have kids?
1827829	1829009	Well, okay, I say kids.
1829109	1832391	I think they're like 17 or 18, but they're like 5 feet tall.
1832491	1833091	Okay, okay.
1833271	1833851	I don't really know.
1833871	1834752	And they want to kick your ass?
1835052	1835292	Yes.
1835952	1837133	Did you fail them or something?
1837533	1837793	No.
1838153	1839013	Oh.
1839153	1847237	I don't know if it's because the Sacramento area is so anti-bar rape or not, and I'm like the biggest bar rapist in the entire area.
1848657	1850298	Big enough to be on a registry?
1850318	1850398	Yeah.
1850808	1851508	I think so.
1852109	1855050	I think I could get on Megan's Law for Bar Rapist.
1855170	1861112	Bugged, I know you're not too familiar with the DDR lingo, but when he says Bar Rapist, he doesn't mean that he goes into bars and rapes people.
1861392	1862312	He's talking about DDR.
1862632	1863673	Like you hold on to the bar.
1864513	1865653	I got that, ah, look.
1868014	1869715	At least now that you know about it anyway.
1870115	1871055	Keep it that way.
1872516	1874277	But that's about it for me.
1875797	1876097	Alright.
1876718	1877558	Bugged, how was your week?
1877578	1877918	How was your day?
1879076	1882618	I got to deal with Pepsi Corporate Office on Wednesday.
1882718	1883118	Very nice.
1883679	1885199	Yeah, they came out for a physical inventory.
1885239	1886180	My boss never showed.
1886280	1887641	The owner of the company never showed.
1888361	1897146	They were more pissed that they didn't show than we were like 400 cases off, which is .0015% deviance.
1897166	1897646	400 cases?
1897726	1898887	How many sodas are in a case?
1899547	1900608	There's 12 cans per case.
1900848	1902509	Oh, that's not too bad, I guess.
1902609	1903089	But still, wow.
1903109	1903650	Out of 272,000, 400 ain't crap, I think.
1907616	1911779	We ended up going up to Yuba City, In-N-Out, and the Rusty Duck.
1912460	1913440	That is good food.
1913460	1914601	What the hell is the Rusty Duck?
1914921	1917143	It's kind of like a hunting lodge for rich weirdos.
1918864	1922947	Or, well, it seems like a hunting lodge for rich weirdos, but it's got really good food.
1923247	1923587	Wow.
1925128	1925448	Okay.
1927249	1928850	And that was pretty much it.
1929571	1935015	I wore my Fugitive t-shirt yesterday, or Friday, whatever the hell that day was, to give my boss the bad news.
1935035	1936355	It says, Fugitive, you never saw me.
1938058	1940279	Drop the paperwork off and ran the fuck home.
1941760	1947142	Isn't it amazing what effect shirts can have on people's reactions to you?
1947442	1948683	I didn't tell them what it was all about.
1949063	1950083	Here's the paperwork.
1950604	1951404	Walked right on out and...
1952571	1953131	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1976102	1983185	I changed one of my pictures on Myspace to actually one of the pictures from the Live 365 Awards where I'm wearing one of those shirts that says tough guys wear pink.
1983665	1985405	And it's one of, you know, it's this typical Hot Topic shirt.
1985926	1992248	And I swear to God, like the day after I changed my picture, the next day I logged on and like 15 girls had all sent me a friend request.
1993188	1994189	And none of them were over 18.
1994309	1997570	Lucky bastard.
1997590	1997810	What?
1998330	1998970	Lucky bastard.
1998990	1999871	You like him young, huh?
2000291	2000911	Damn right.
2000971	2003532	If I wanted to be like a, you know,
2004255	2009478	and Pedophilia Act or whatever they call them, Child Molester, MySpace would be heaven.
2009658	2010158	It's great.
2010819	2011819	Honestly, seriously.
2011879	2017442	So if that's what you're into as underage girls, just dress metrosexual and sign up for MySpace.
2017803	2018663	I got it covered.
2020544	2021825	You've got the metrosexual thing down.
2021845	2024226	How many friend requests from little girls do you get on MySpace?
2024426	2027168	Well, see, everybody lies about their age, so you can't tell.
2027228	2031910	So if they're 19, 16, you take off three years every single time.
2031950	2032931	About three years is around.
2032951	2033091	Yeah.
2033840	2034140	All right.
2036262	2045489	I don't lie on my age, but... I don't either, but... I mean, I just think it's funny, but I actually accepted all their frame requests because then they all leave me comments going, Oh, thanks for adding me!
2045769	2046370	Oh, yeah.
2046430	2048572	And I'm like, Oh, that makes my ego feel good.
2048692	2050513	Yeah, I'm like, I'm a MySpace friends whore.
2050533	2051934	I'll just add, like, random people.
2051954	2052475	I don't know who they are.
2052495	2053596	I don't really care either.
2054016	2056498	It's like, I'm not actually on there to meet people, you know?
2057699	2060281	My sister on MySpace has a thousand friends.
2060961	2061842	One thousand friends.
2061862	2062382	Damn.
2062743	2063043	I'm like...
2064195	2064395	Freezepop
2080214	2081175	has the thing on MySpace.
2081475	2082536	I have Mr. T on mine.
2082817	2091965	Mr. T. I love how they have, like, the really crap, like, you can have people randomly leave, like, clips of video and stuff.
2092005	2092505	And images.
2092585	2093246	I do that all the time.
2093286	2094507	I leave images on people's journals.
2095048	2095388	It's fun.
2096349	2105417	But, yeah, I mean, yeah, that's the worst, is my sister, because she has a thousand friends, if you load up her page, there's five videos that play all at the same time.
2106338	2106438	Oof.
2106863	2110585	and one of them is like a bum begging for money and the other one's like a skateboarding video.
2110645	2111845	Yeah, it's like bum fights or something.
2111885	2112185	Nice.
2112265	2115487	And the other one's like a skateboarding video and then some death rock song.
2115927	2118108	MySpace is where the internet goes to die.
2118288	2118968	It really is.
2119108	2123630	But sometimes you just want to feel cheap.
2123870	2124270	Yeah.
2124531	2127572	I don't know what the allure of MySpace is because really... Everybody has one.
2127692	2129053	It's an ugly site.
2129453	2131634	There's no point to MySpace, really.
2132114	2132314	But...
2133343	2135666	yet I feel strangely attracted to it.
2135786	2136968	It's like the Fox Network.
2138449	2139050	That was low.
2139571	2140612	I don't know how to explain it.
2141473	2143596	Speaking of Fox Network, Family Guy in an Hour?
2144437	2147620	Don't tell people that because then they'll turn this show off to go listen to it.
2148181	2149002	That's why there's TiVo.
2149062	2151385	That's why you have TiVo and why you have BitTorrent.
2152759	2153319	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2174378	2175058	MySpace, yeah.
2175778	2176218	End of story.
2176258	2176618	Enough said.
2177699	2179939	Notice how Orange Lounge does not have a community on MySpace.
2179959	2183059	We have a community on just about every other website out there, but we do not have one on MySpace.
2183420	2185480	Although, I think Jamie had hinted about starting one.
2185980	2188500	I'm planning on doing that since I actually have some free time to do that.
2189141	2191241	Now, I'm surprised that you're on MySpace.
2191361	2191701	Aren't you?
2191761	2193581	I joined it for some gorillas thing.
2193661	2196402	Yeah, but have you actually looked at some of the other people's profiles on there?
2196722	2197382	Oh, scary.
2197402	2198702	Let me send you my sister's page.
2199462	2200763	But, you know what?
2200903	2203443	I barely look at it, only when I remember to.
2204036	2204736	Thank you for watching!
2219364	2224267	But, Geocities, man, hosted some ugly ass websites.
2224648	2225628	I mean, seriously.
2225989	2232233	And it would be like, you know, page dedicated to Britney Spears and it has like the MIDI file embedded in the page.
2232613	2234734	No, let's see.
2234774	2236756	Hey, you guys should see if my page is still up.
2236956	2243480	It's www.geocities.com slash nightmare underscore hunter.
2243900	2244261	And then...
2245787	2247388	Do you have many files embedded in your page?
2247528	2251851	No, but I had a page dedicated to stupid people and how I hated them.
2252011	2252832	Oh, now I have to look.
2253953	2254813	I had stories.
2256574	2263038	Geocities.com My friend on the East Coast just recently made a page dedicated to her new car.
2264239	2265780	This is Geocities for you.
2265820	2268162	She actually made the font color match her car.
2269583	2271244	Anyway, so it's Nightmare underscore Hunter?
2272024	2272224	Yeah.
2272244	2273025	Let me see if I can find it.
2273885	2274906	I know this is great radio.
2275697	2277358	I don't even know if it's still up anymore.
2277378	2279839	I used to have a Lemmings page too.
2280079	2280579	Yep, there it is.
2280599	2282020	Oh my god, it's really there.
2283500	2284040	Wow.
2284641	2285641	Oh, this is great.
2286521	2288562	Last update, September 26th, 01.
2289503	2290803	Added DDR page.
2290843	2292644	Let's see what links he has on the DDR page.
2293144	2294325	I had sim files at the time.
2294465	2300007	You have a Club Tropicana DWI and a Quake 2 theme DWI.
2300894	2303515	And then this is great, and you see this shit on Geocities pages all the time.
2303975	2305436	Links to BMS files.
2305836	2306376	Nothing under it.
2307116	2308377	That's because I erased them.
2310418	2311718	Where's the stupid people page?
2311898	2313219	Encounters with stupid people.
2313739	2314219	Let's see.
2314919	2318641	Warning, the following are actual encounters with actual stupid people.
2320021	2321602	August 25th, Saturday.
2322082	2325243	Location, Roseville Galleria Electronics Boutique.
2325643	2327064	Case name, Stupid Clerk.
2328331	2330013	It was Saturday in the late afternoon.
2330433	2333015	I'd never been to the Galleria before, so I thought, what the hell?
2333456	2338160	I was looking for a Dex drive for my PlayStation so that I could upload my PlayStation saves to this site.
2338800	2342043	Anyways, I found this third-party device called the MP Exchanger.
2342444	2345366	So I walk up to the counter to pay, and I was greeted with stupidity.
2345766	2348229	Here's an approximate dialogue of the conversation.
2348928	2351109	Clerk, so you find everything alright?
2351189	2352030	Looks down at my purchase.
2352370	2353131	Me, yeah.
2353611	2356113	Clerk, man, I was waiting for this thing to sell.
2356193	2358354	I have no idea why anyone would need this for.
2358454	2360495	I have no idea how it works or if it works.
2360916	2364398	Me, it copies game saves to your PC off a memory card.
2364498	2367860	Clerk, okay, would you like to buy insurance in case you break it within a year?
2368340	2368661	No!
2369761	2370562	Clerk, giggles.
2370742	2371362	Okay, that'll be $5,000.
2371422	2371642	Giggles.
2371662	2371702	Me...
2377026	2380668	Me, looks at the cash register display then hands the moron the correct amount of money, $29.95.
2382149	2383370	Clerk, hands me the receipt.
2383730	2384930	Let me know if that thing works.
2385190	2386551	Me, walking out of the store.
2387051	2387772	Whatever.
2390603	2392163	How old were you when you wrote this?
2392183	2392523	21, probably?
2392823	2393083	Yeah.
2393264	2393984	Whatever!
2394004	2397444	I don't think I actually went like that, but, you know.
2397704	2399145	Well, that's what you put, whatever.
2399785	2402885	Moral of the story, and by the way, moral is M-O-R-A-L-E.
2403145	2405426	Okay, I was, you know, I don't care.
2405666	2406526	Morale?
2406566	2407386	No, wait, no, I'm kidding.
2407446	2408466	Never mind, I'm thinking something else.
2409146	2411407	When you see it in all fables, it's always morale of the story.
2411707	2412707	I swear to God, that's what you see.
2414227	2414447	No.
2414567	2416488	I swear, like, I had books, and that's what it said.
2416708	2417348	Never mind, forget it.
2417368	2417448	Ugh.
2418959	2424985	Moral of the story, when dealing with the I think I'm funny clerk type, it's best to just ignore any attempt they make to make you laugh.
2425365	2427587	Failure to do so will only prolong the torture.
2429208	2430189	That's wonderful advice.
2431130	2432151	The more you know.
2432511	2433452	Okay, anyway.
2433933	2437996	The other one on there is some stupid guy at Burger King or like McDonald's or something.
2440519	2440639	Sigh.
2441018	2443720	Well, if you want to check that out, you can visit his old website there.
2443760	2444461	It's fucking great.
2444901	2446543	Anyway, it sucks.
2446583	2448344	I want to see what other sites you have linked on here.
2448404	2450866	I want to see what the cool sites were to visit back in 2001.
2450906	2452688	I don't think I have any links.
2452708	2454029	Oh, you don't have a links page.
2454109	2455250	Everybody had a links page.
2455530	2456491	I didn't have a links page.
2458072	2459093	You have a WhoAmI.
2460595	2463177	Your birth date on here, by the way, is listed as 9-11-01.
2463217	2463537	Good job.
2468852	2470693	I didn't want them to know how old I was.
2471433	2471693	And that's 01.
2472314	2474515	I'm like, you know, a hundred-some years old, man.
2474655	2475775	I'm fucking awesome.
2477096	2477396	Alright.
2477476	2481958	Mine's still floating around somewhere on the internet, although GeoCities finally deleted it.
2482579	2485180	But I have DarkSakura's Mostly Evil Shrine.
2485680	2486901	I saw that years ago.
2487521	2487901	That was me.
2487921	2488242	That's funny.
2488882	2492244	And then I had two, uh, a Best of Move and a Best of Move 2 site.
2492464	2495105	They're actually still up on the anime web turnpike.
2495762	2514613	you know what's funny is all these people in our chat room right now over at www.orangehunter.com they're all looking up their Geocities pages right now and all I see in the chat room right now is this OMG my site's still up OMG OMG I can't believe it's still there I haven't updated my site in like four years I'm surprised that's even up that's great alright
2515717	2519559	Cody, by the way, your girlfriend is in chat and wants to know that your girlfriend's listening.
2520259	2525081	Uh, yeah, I also just got a text a second ago that said, Bad Andrew, yes, I'm listening.
2525101	2526161	And I'm just like, oh, shit.
2526361	2526702	Uh-oh.
2527082	2529002	Yeah, gotta watch what I say.
2529022	2530843	He didn't mean anything by the underage girl thing.
2530963	2531263	Yeah.
2531343	2532384	It's all underage boys.
2532744	2533264	I'm kidding.
2533584	2534465	Wait, wait, wait.
2534485	2534545	Uh...
2536112	2540834	Anyway, Toadie, as long as you have the microphone, let's talk about our fabulous party we went to.
2540874	2541374	What night was it?
2541394	2542035	Wednesday, Tuesday?
2542055	2543075	Wednesday night.
2543235	2545036	So how did you get hooked up with this?
2545056	2551059	We went to our very first video game premiere, and it was for In the Groove, the new dancing game coming out on PlayStation 2.
2551859	2558262	The controversial dancing game, I guess I really should say, because it seems like the dance game community is really divided over this In the Groove game.
2559002	2560303	If you've been living under a rock...
2560994	2575594	in the groove is this game that was created by and I think it's fair to say fans of the DDR series are folks that made this game but what they wanted to do was kind of improve on what they felt DDR was lacking on but it's in no way like DDR ever
2576557	2577718	No way at all.
2577738	2582360	But it's a completely different game, even though it has four arrows that scroll up that you dance to.
2583081	2586563	In DDR machines, mind you, the upgrade, it's nothing like DDR.
2586643	2593607	It's Mario versus, that's the greatest argument I read, is that DDR versus in the group, it's like Mario versus Sonic.
2594708	2596008	Oh, yikes.
2596228	2600691	You don't put a new sticker on your Nintendo case and suddenly turn it into Sonic.
2600711	2601592	But that's another story, forget it.
2602652	2603953	Despite how you feel about the game.
2605040	2609062	We got to go to this party, and you got hooked up through ITG Freak?
2609083	2610623	I got up ITG Freak, yeah.
2610864	2617207	And DDR Freak was kind enough to hook us up with passes, because we don't count as a legitimate media source in the industry or something.
2617247	2619269	It's a shame.
2620049	2621650	We haven't really worked with Red Octane in the past.
2621670	2623511	I don't even think they know who we are, so it's cool.
2624632	2632977	Actually, they do know who we are, because they offered us a partnership deal a few years ago when I was hosting Shaft.
2634437	2635258	How did I miss that?
2636078	2638560	I think we tried to do the whole Red Octane thing out of the head.
2638780	2639601	They know about us now.
2639841	2641162	Some of them might be listening even.
2641202	2641743	Hi, Red Octane.
2641763	2642003	Hi.
2642983	2643184	Anyway.
2643744	2644965	I swear we're not going to bash this game.
2645045	2645465	Anyway, no.
2645525	2649368	I have things to say about it, but I'll ask Tony first.
2649388	2651590	How was your drive down, and what did you think when you got there?
2651850	2656072	Well, we would have been on time, but, you know, hour of traffic.
2656132	2660734	And then when we actually got to San Francisco, we were like, oh, hey, look, it's the Fifth Street Garage.
2660754	2669779	So we ended up going down ten blocks because there were no left turns on any of them and down about another five streets and another ten blocks back to get to the parking garage.
2670259	2671339	That was a pain in the ass.
2671399	2679203	And then we were, I hope this guy's not listening, but there was this creepy-ass guy that just, like, approached me and my guest as we were walking up
2679710	2686814	and just started asking us about music fees and royalties and how much he should charge Red Octane and stuff like that for his music.
2687274	2688435	And it's like, get away from me.
2688475	2689075	I don't know you.
2689115	2689875	Please don't touch me.
2690016	2690316	You know what?
2690356	2691276	There might be a reason for that.
2692097	2693898	It has to do with something else Red Octane mentioned this week.
2694438	2696099	I'll get to that in a minute.
2696199	2697380	I was very confused.
2697600	2700781	And he gave me his phone number when he left, which made me even more confused.
2700901	2701222	Hot.
2701702	2702502	Grant, call him!
2702822	2703923	Grant, call him!
2703943	2704743	You want to call him right now?
2704844	2705524	I should have brought it.
2705544	2706644	You want to call him right now on the show?
2707005	2707085	No.
2708232	2711753	I wish I brought it with me, you know, but... Alright.
2713214	2716455	Alright, well, okay, so you got there, and what did you think when you got to the thing?
2717135	2724337	Well, the place was a lot smaller than I thought it was going to be, but I think they were honestly expecting a lot more people to show up.
2726081	2729682	I was actually surprised that there weren't as many people as I thought.
2729742	2731723	Don't get me wrong, I kind of liked it that way.
2731743	2733664	It was a really nice vibe there.
2734505	2736305	I didn't really personally know a lot of people there.
2736325	2740007	I did run into a few people in the scene, such as yourself and a couple of people from other websites.
2740507	2745490	Believe it or not, even though we're all quote-unquote competing websites, we all sit down and have drinks.
2745570	2745870	It's fun.
2747031	2749132	And good people that run the other websites in the community.
2750828	2760192	But if you think about it, like, DDR Freak had 10 passes to give away, but Monty Stone had 10 passes to give away, and the group Freak had 10 passes to give away, and if they all bring a guest, that's 60 people right there.
2760312	2762533	There was maybe 60 people in the entire place.
2762613	2765755	I know, I kind of was like, wow, and Red Octane had a lot of people there.
2766255	2766495	Yeah.
2766515	2770457	Like, most of the people there were from Red Octane, it seemed, or some type of press or something.
2770477	2772298	Well, if I can rant here for a second.
2772318	2772478	Sure.
2772498	2774299	This is something I saw on DDR Freak anyway.
2775279	2776860	What I kept seeing was all these, like, 15-year-olds...
2777748	2778688	Why won't they let me in?
2778728	2782209	Why won't they just let us have a pass that doesn't let us have alcohol or something like that?
2782229	2785190	It's like, well, you're completely missing the point of what this is.
2785790	2788711	The employees want to go down there and just get fucking wasted.
2788771	2793673	You know, they just, we completed a game, we're going to have a party, and they don't want to have to deal with 15-year-olds.
2793873	2798394	I'm sorry to say it, but I mean, that's... I talked to a bunch of Red Octane employees there.
2799194	2799775	You know what?
2799975	2800555	I'm kind of...
2802310	2803291	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2831227	2833689	One of the rotten apples would get in there and fuck it all up.
2834130	2840094	Not to say that everybody over 21 is perfect, but luckily we lucked out.
2840135	2841115	Everybody there was very cool.
2841155	2842556	I didn't run into anybody I disliked.
2843377	2847561	And trust me, there's people over 21 that are stupid that I'm glad stayed far away from this.
2848141	2851784	But I think there's just a certain maturity level expectation.
2853265	2854486	And that's just the way life is.
2854686	2855827	I'm sorry to say it.
2856248	2858870	But someday you will have this conversation with...
2860265	2860905	Other teenagers.
2861025	2862645	So, you know, I don't know what else to say.
2862805	2866746	Yeah, more than anything else, I mean, there were so many Red Octane and Rockstar employees there.
2866786	2874548	I mean, it was basically a party for them, not really for the fans of the game, so... Yeah, that's what I thought was also interesting about this.
2875248	2879208	The party really wasn't for hardcore in-the-groove players.
2879589	2886190	I think that was the number one misconception about this, was that, oh, it was going to be the best of the best in-the-groove players showing off this game.
2886710	2887510	Whereas, in fact...
2888328	2890231	Most people were just average.
2890331	2894136	Tony was probably one of the best players there, and there was only a handful.
2894176	2898801	I could probably count them on one hand, how many 10, 11, 12 foot players were at this thing.
2899663	2903247	I mean, when people are looking at me and going, this guy is good, come on.
2903808	2904729	Oh, you got moves.
2904809	2905189	I've seen them.
2910087	2916631	So, yeah, so what I loved about it, though, is that there was an open bar, and the club was very posh.
2917111	2917732	It was nice.
2918232	2920033	Honestly, these guys know how to throw a party.
2920633	2920893	Oh, I agree.
2920913	2925176	Despite how you may feel about In the Groove, the party was awesome.
2925196	2925916	That was brilliant.
2926136	2928418	Free sushi, all that stuff.
2928498	2928978	Oh, my gosh.
2928998	2929859	Drink all night.
2930139	2931980	In the Groove totally knows... I'm sorry, Red Octane.
2932000	2932700	Stop rubbing it in.
2933321	2933561	Sorry.
2935453	2937114	Red Octane totally knows how to buy my love.
2937434	2937894	Honestly.
2937954	2939315	Oh yeah, I had a great time.
2939375	2943557	If they could buy off my opinion on this game, this would have been a great party to do it.
2943637	2944938	It would have been Driver 3.
2945918	2946198	What?
2947439	2950340	If they could buy off your opinion on this game, that game would have been Driver 3?
2950381	2952181	Yeah, I would have been giving Driver 3 reviews of the game.
2952221	2954262	But okay, as far as the feelings for the game myself.
2954302	2957604	Okay, so I got to check out the home version of In the Groove on PlayStation 2.
2958284	2963207	And as you guys know, I've always been... And when I first reviewed In the Groove, this is what I said about it.
2963909	2969255	It's not as bad as the people who are saying In the Groove should die and go away is saying.
2969295	2970096	It's not that bad.
2970876	2977683	But it's not as good as what the people who are saying OMG, DDR is dead forever, ITG for life is saying.
2978164	2979265	It's somewhere in the middle.
2979866	2984550	That is how I still feel about this game even after seeing it at the show.
2985071	2985932	I was actually...
2987356	2991879	More impressed, I didn't think the game would translate as well to the PlayStation 2 as it did.
2992359	2998422	Because you have to consider that a lot of this game was kind of homebrew, really.
2998903	3003305	Step Mania was a homebrew thing, and it kind of evolved from that, right?
3003625	3004666	So a lot of this game was homebrew.
3004706	3009568	It actually translates very well and very smoothly into a PlayStation 2 game, so I was pretty impressed with that.
3011192	3033039	as far as the game itself though it's it's it's in the groove you already have an opinion on this game honestly there's nothing I'm gonna say that's gonna change your mind one way or the other if you've played in the groove in the arcade you like it you're gonna like the home release if you don't like it you're not gonna like it so I I would recommend in the groove to dance game fans but I still would say if it's your first game
3034068	3035649	I don't know, you may want to weigh your options a little bit.
3035689	3038011	I think DDR has some more beginner accessible things.
3038351	3041573	I think in the groove is always going to be more for the hardcore niche player.
3041613	3048217	That's my... Actually, the home version actually added a new training slash beginners mode that's not available in the arcade.
3048297	3048778	Right, right.
3049058	3055022	I did notice that, but I was still... I don't know, it's still... I don't know what it is.
3055162	3056523	In the groove, it just doesn't have that...
3058144	3058665	DarkSakura
3078007	3086850	I mean, and I know that might sound a little bit belittling, but it really is kind of a compliment that it is actually holding my attention for a new DDR.
3086910	3092512	Because, you know, it's unfortunate that Konami has kind of slowed down on the arcade stuff at least.
3092652	3094253	But this home version is a whole other world.
3094273	3095593	We're going to get into later in the show.
3096094	3097814	This is going to be a huge year for Dance Game.
3097834	3099615	That is now four Dance Games.
3100302	3104252	After this week, we know for sure there are four dance games coming out this year, and they all want your attention.
3104753	3107620	But honestly, most people that listen to this show are going to buy all four anyway.
3108222	3108543	I think.
3108643	3108944	I don't know.
3108984	3109465	Probably.
3109485	3109826	Probably.
3111751	3120918	The biggest compliment that I had of the game, and I really want to credit Red Octane for doing this, is that they kept the timing windows in the game the same as the arcade.
3121418	3122259	Yeah, that was cool.
3122359	3132047	That is my absolute biggest criticism whatsoever of all the home versions for DDR games, because you actually get used to playing on those and you go to the arcade and you just suck.
3133851	3134871	You know, you're terrible.
3134911	3138253	You're just off by a couple milliseconds and you start great attacking everything.
3138273	3139493	And you're like, what the hell's going on?
3139554	3140894	At home, I'm triple A-ing this.
3141895	3144336	So I'm really, really glad that they kept that the same.
3144376	3147297	It's actually going to be able to improve your ability in the arcade.
3149267	3158698	I'll tell you one thing I really liked, and this was something that really surprised me about the party, because I did not think I would be as impressed by this as I was, was Red Octane's Metal Pad.
3159099	3161361	Yes, I was wondering if you were going to cover the Afterburner.
3161381	3163684	The Afterburner is amazing.
3164085	3166307	I thought it was, it's great.
3166828	3168290	It's the best Metal Pad I've played on.
3169226	3170407	But of course, I haven't played on that many.
3170567	3171427	But it's the best.
3171547	3172527	It's so responsive.
3172628	3173148	It's smooth.
3173328	3173988	It's great.
3174328	3180671	Well, I own two personalized Cobalt Fluxes, and I can easily say that I would rather have two Afterburners.
3181151	3185533	Do you know the other thing I noticed about the Afterburners, which is awesome, the way they lock together?
3185753	3188034	So you can kind of play doubles with the pads locked together.
3188415	3190776	The only thing the Afterburner is missing, seriously, is a bar.
3191336	3198239	Yes, I was actually talking to a guy named Atma, who works for Red Octane, and they actually have development going on for that.
3198959	3203581	I don't know if it'll actually go through or not, but I was offering some suggestions, of course, because it's the bar.
3203761	3204161	Right, right.
3204421	3207142	Now, and you can't play these games without the bar, as you found out.
3207242	3208743	It's quite difficult for me.
3209163	3213504	And that's going to be a problem for this game coming home, but interesting creative solutions.
3213584	3215265	Now, you tried something.
3215765	3216866	It didn't work too well.
3217326	3217846	I tried.
3218846	3220967	What did you try to do as a bar replacement at the party?
3221087	3225789	Well, since I didn't really have any chairs there, I basically just grabbed one of these metal bar stools.
3226431	3228212	I saw my ass on the picture gallery multiple times.
3228232	3228512	Yes, DarkSakura.
3256142	3259024	I was in the other room at that moment, but I heard Afterburner.
3259705	3262847	Not only are they ripping off DDR, now they're ripping off Sega.
3265349	3266630	Okay, well, well, well, wait.
3266690	3272374	I think we all know that this is not... The new Afterburner pad has nothing to do with everybody's favorite jet-flying game.
3272594	3272934	No, I know.
3273055	3275676	I know, but this just makes me want to hook up my 32X.
3276337	3276917	I know, you're teasing.
3278573	3284275	But the Afterburner pads, honestly, I was more impressed with the Afterburner pads than anything else in the show.
3284295	3285055	I thought they were great.
3285135	3290756	Yeah, is that the first metal pad that really has a system of, like, the depressed arrows like the Arcade?
3291036	3296758	I know the Cobalt Flux is completely flat, and I've had, like, a MyMyBox, which was pretty much flat also.
3296958	3298858	I'm going to ask our expert here, because I don't know, really.
3298918	3300219	Your pads that you built had it.
3300679	3304540	My pads rock, that's why, because I put my hard, you know...
3306151	3310754	I put a lot of hard effort into getting them, well, built.
3313095	3315897	Working, it's a little different.
3316157	3317018	But my pads rock.
3317298	3318038	They weigh a ton.
3319900	3323362	But as far as depressors, most of them are like flat and they're lame.
3323742	3326604	Like, I remember those old metal pads you can get off of eBay or whatever.
3326624	3328845	I don't even remember where I bought metal pads from.
3328865	3332607	I ended up selling them to someone and the first time I stepped on it, it bent.
3333588	3333868	I'm like,
3334540	3335460	Why did it bend?
3335800	3336521	That's weird.
3336821	3338121	Because it's made of tinfoil.
3339622	3344943	I'm sorry if I sound like I was knocking your metal pads, Loki, but these pads actually worked for more than 15 minutes.
3345523	3347764	Because mine aren't groundy, you dumbass.
3347884	3348264	Shit.
3348284	3352766	Once I put that wire on, man, those fucking pads are going to rock.
3352966	3355767	Dude, but these pads at the show, they were taking abuse.
3355827	3357647	I saw girls in heels playing on these pads.
3357987	3360568	They were taking a lot of abuse, and they were still holding up great.
3361028	3361628	Stupid women.
3362549	3363129	Stop it!
3364065	3364826	DDR is dead!
3364846	3366267	If you still play DDR, you're a fag!
3391072	3392294	Thank you for watching!
3402038	3403519	I don't care how you spin it.
3403940	3407642	In the Groove is a deviation of the DDR game.
3408103	3415848	You cannot spin this any other way that I will believe you that this is not some type of at least inspired by DDR.
3415909	3417270	You cannot spin it.
3417530	3419631	Had there been no DDR, there would be no In the Groove.
3419831	3420312	Absolutely.
3420332	3420732	Period.
3420832	3421713	End of sentence.
3421753	3422593	That sums it up there.
3423274	3424695	And these kids out there that are just
3425293	3429515	saying, you know, DDR is dead, have no respect for where In The Groove came from.
3429876	3432177	Hello, DDR fans, build In The Groove!
3435179	3435459	I'm done.
3436239	3441742	And they also built stupid, uh, what was it, that dancing stage, um, Unleashed or whatever.
3443623	3449667	Oh, well, stupid Konami, they can't get anything right as far as, like, you know, the new, uh, arcade games.
3449727	3451908	I mean, I swear, you know,
3452856	3453236	I don't know.
3454597	3458580	I'm really curious to see what they're going to come up with for this year's E3.
3460801	3461202	EyeToy.
3461222	3462823	That was a great idea.
3463143	3464144	Let's do that again.
3464164	3464564	You know what?
3464604	3466666	I think people were way too harsh on the EyeToy thing.
3466766	3468567	Oh, yeah.
3468607	3470048	Wait, wait, wait.
3470088	3470488	Hold on.
3470528	3471049	Hold on a minute.
3471709	3472990	I don't want to get too far off topic here.
3473010	3474051	I'm not done within the groove yet.
3474111	3476192	But the EyeToy thing, look at it this way.
3476772	3480395	For those of us that are into DDR and all that stuff, it was kind of silly.
3481033	3483934	But let's face it, DDR was not just made for us.
3484094	3487316	It was also made for nine-year-old girls to have at their slumber parties.
3487476	3488256	Like it or not.
3489076	3492097	And this is a topic I'm going to bring back later when we start talking about Xtreme 2.
3493038	3496499	Nine-year-old girls in their slumber parties think this iToy shit's hilarious.
3497099	3498120	Not that I know firsthand.
3498140	3500941	I've just, you know, heard things and read about them on certain internet websites.
3502302	3503703	iToy was not made for you.
3504223	3505484	It was not made for you, the fan.
3505624	3508687	It was made to make DDR more accessible and more showy and flashy.
3509147	3513550	And that's why DDR does so well, because it's such a showy, flashy game.
3513590	3517513	And that's something that In the Groove, by the way, completely lacks, is showiness and flashiness.
3517813	3522276	In the Groove looks like this industrial, sad, sad, gothic thing.
3523697	3527240	Not to knock the game quality, because it's a fun game, but it looks bad.
3527340	3528120	It looks too American.
3528180	3529841	Yeah, sadly, it looks too American.
3530482	3530682	Anyway.
3531870	3543440	Yeah, because I love the eye toy game where you hit the stupid ball around and you spend like 15 minutes trying to get the ball to go where you want it to go and it sucks and it's so frustrating.
3543620	3549725	I'm already pissed off at Sonic Team for not doing a real Knights game and instead doing Knights in that eye toy collection.
3550905	3551066	What?
3552207	3557751	Yeah, I remember that Sega collection thing that they were doing the eye toy with at E3.
3558291	3558532	Uh-huh.
3559032	3560273	Well, there's a Knights game in it.
3561178	3562379	Why couldn't they just make Knights?
3563340	3565041	I'm sorry, I had to rant about iToy.
3565101	3567563	Yeah, why couldn't they just freaking make Samba on PS2?
3567583	3574508	Dude, Sonic Team just needs to be given a whole shitload of money and do nothing but make games that I tell them to.
3574748	3581373	Okay, and of course we have somebody in our chatroom right now that says, SSJ100Matt says, iToy games equal great games to play with your penis.
3583014	3585096	You always know somebody's gotta be the jokester.
3586277	3586457	Ass!
3586977	3588638	Alright, that'll make that work.
3588778	3589479	Back to In The Groove.
3593255	3593576	I know.
3593976	3596858	Back to In the Groove for a minute, alright, before we get on all these other tangents.
3596898	3597639	Alright, so In the Groove.
3598139	3599000	Do I recommend the game?
3599901	3601963	If you like In the Groove, yes.
3602123	3604745	If you don't know how you feel about it, at least check it out.
3605005	3605966	Form your own opinion.
3606006	3607227	Don't listen to people on the internet.
3607447	3608729	That is my opinion on In the Groove.
3608769	3609990	Don't listen to people on the internet.
3610010	3611731	Play the game for yourself and form your own opinion.
3612332	3612652	There it is.
3613873	3615494	Honestly, you know what this is right here?
3615674	3619658	Okay, this is the equivalent of, like, say...
3620618	3637641	Okay, you've got, you know, like your hair care products and stuff like that, okay, and you've got, you know, for women they have their conditioner and stuff, and then, you know, guys won't buy that crap because they're like, that's gay, I'm not gonna play that, I'm not gonna put that gay shit in my hair, so then they come up with like something cool, EXTREME GEL!
3638121	3640162	Okay, so you buy this extreme gel.
3640182	3643903	It's basically the same damn thing as the women's product, but repackaged, so you buy it.
3644083	3645344	This is what In The Groove is.
3645464	3650405	In The Groove is the Dance Dance Revolution game that you can play and not feel gay about.
3650805	3651686	That's what it is.
3653306	3658368	That is quite possibly the best analogy for this whole damn thing I've ever heard in my entire life.
3658448	3659128	Congratulations.
3659208	3659789	Hats off to you.
3661109	3662850	People should post that on every forum.
3663910	3664610	That's all it is.
3664650	3665370	That's really what it is.
3665390	3666071	You better copyright that.
3666091	3666871	You better copyright it.
3667313	3669315	It's the men's suave of the dancing world.
3670196	3671798	It's pH balance for a guy.
3671858	3673981	Exactly, they have that crap now.
3674381	3676003	pH balance for my ass.
3676724	3679867	If it wasn't pH balance, you know, just put that shit on.
3679887	3681129	Oh my god, it burns!
3682250	3683532	Anyways, yeah.
3684112	3685554	Toadie, your thoughts.
3687034	3690516	Well, I've already kind of been an ITG fanboy.
3690536	3694638	I mean, the first time I played it, I really thought it was pretty much just gimmicky bullshit.
3694698	3696959	You know, I'm like, mines, you know, what the fuck is this?
3697079	3697919	Who cares, you know?
3698379	3700500	I actually tried to do my first hand plant the other day.
3700520	3702061	I will never do that again.
3702281	3704762	I burst a couple veins in my hand.
3704842	3705663	I threw out my back.
3706863	3707323	All right.
3707704	3709624	But, I mean, the more I played it, the more I liked it.
3709664	3712746	And, like I said, they're not making any more DDR, so, I mean, I'm going to keep playing it.
3712826	3715087	But, I mean, I was impressed with the home version.
3716646	3720588	They got some stuff from ITG2 on here, so it should be pretty good.
3721309	3723570	They didn't fuck with the timing windows, so I'm happy.
3725031	3725932	I got it pre-ordered.
3726432	3728053	You know what, I'm going to pick it up.
3728834	3732296	My opinion of In the Groove is, even though I say I'm on the fence, it's favorable.
3732456	3735918	I think it's only going to be like $30, so I'm going to pick it up.
3736739	3737159	Why not?
3737679	3739260	The DDR games aren't going to be out until fall.
3739861	3740861	I'm going to pick up these games.
3741502	3743103	I think most people will.
3745806	3747686	I will soon, jerk.
3748174	3748414	RedOctane
3776833	3778015	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3790839	3792640	Hit me up offline and I'll give you the address.
3792981	3795122	But that rumor as it stands is completely false.
3795202	3797784	We got shirts and keychains and other cute little things.
3797844	3798425	Lots of beer.
3799125	3800486	And alcohol, which was great.
3801187	3802608	Like I said, Red Octane, No South Road Party.
3802628	3803769	I thought that bar was very cool.
3804709	3807632	I loved how we took over the media room at one point towards the end of the evening.
3807712	3808652	I had a great time.
3808692	3809353	Met some good people.
3810334	3817539	Honestly, I think what this did, it made me a little more favorable of the In The Groove community as a whole because I know now that there are good people around.
3817919	3833122	I think between that and the news that Red Octane came out with later in the week, I'm actually really respecting what Red Octane's trying to do.
3834107	3834748	RedOctane
3863436	3865737	Anyway, for now, I think what we'll do is we'll do a little bit of a break.
3865977	3868278	Oh, actually, I want to respond to some chatroom comments before we get a break.
3869679	3875081	One thing somebody said, Kuwabara, and I'm sorry if I mispronounced that, said, I don't feel gay when I play DDR.
3875462	3876302	Well, you know, okay.
3877205	3881206	And that's true, you shouldn't, because dance games do not have a sexuality.
3881546	3887388	I think Loki's comment, though, you have to remember, is more towards what the general public views these games as.
3887508	3901413	We, as you folks who are geeky enough to tune into a music station that is towards these dance games, and, you know, us in the community, we know it's not gay, and we know, we have fun with it, but you have to remember, the average, you know, Joe Q. Jock guy that comes to an arcade,
3901894	3902034	R.V.G.O.
3921451	3923533	Yeah, but they don't exactly call you queer.
3924173	3927837	But no, but they still get up and act asshole-ish on the machine.
3928217	3932320	So, my favorite circumstance is when I went up to these guys and said, Okay, I'll pay.
3932821	3933622	But I picked the songs.
3935723	3937005	And what was it that I picked?
3937045	3938966	It was something fairly vicious, What Rhythm And Police.
3938986	3940067	Yeah, it was something pretty mean.
3940408	3940628	Yeah.
3940648	3941028	It was cool.
3941168	3943931	And they just stopped there and went, Ugh.
3944933	3947536	I won't challenge anybody unless it's for like $40 a game.
3947576	3948757	I'm like, don't waste my time.
3950338	3953181	You want to play a five-time tournament winner?
3953201	3954102	$40 a game, asshole.
3954122	3954783	That's what you're doing.
3954823	3956224	I'm not wasting my time with you.
3956725	3961129	But my whole point with this was that I showed them just exactly how stupid they were being.
3961149	3961970	Yeah, it's great.
3962070	3965133	And then usually those other people that they get up and do that, I have them kicked out of the arcade.
3965153	3965974	You made a kid cry once.
3966414	3967595	That was the most beautiful thing ever.
3967695	3968775	It wasn't just you, but everybody.
3968955	3974718	Because you did something, and then we all gathered around, and we were like, yeah, do it, do it, do it, you stupid kid, do it.
3975058	3977279	And he ran off into the bathroom, and you know he was crying.
3978120	3988745	Well, like, when we were playing Pot of Potta, those people who were getting back there, and the one that knocked me in the shoulder, you know, doing fake whatever, I had, like, seven people kicked out of the arcade that night.
3989758	3990318	Wow.
3990658	3998861	I used to be, until I stopped, because I stopped going right after that, I used to have people kicked out of the arcade every time I was there because I wouldn't stand for it.
3999341	4007484	I would not stand to go into an arcade and see people acting like complete stupid idiots when the whole purpose of going to an arcade is to enjoy yourself and have a good time.
4007524	4007804	Yeah.
4008644	4008985	All right.
4009885	4010185	All right.
4010760	4014343	Anyway, what we're going to do now, we're going to go to a break because we've been sitting here for a while dishing on In The Groove.
4014363	4019287	We're going to come back and we're going to talk about now what Konami's up to because everything has just hit the fan this week.
4019587	4028334	It was seriously like you could see the tumbleweed flying across, you know, the Bomani scene has been dead and now just seriously, like over the weekend, bam, it all hit.
4028694	4031556	So we're going to talk about what now Konami's up to right after this break.
4031936	4037521	In this break, since we've been talking a little bit about In The Groove, I figured I'd humor the In The Groove fans with some music from In The Groove.
4037561	4040403	And in case you haven't actually played the game, you can hear what some of the music sounds like.
4040663	4045145	So we're going to start it off with some Nina with Fly With Me, and we'll be back with more Orange Lounge Radio after this.
4078679	4080360	Thank you for watching!
4118992	4124238	The Bright in the Sky Finding your way to my home Come play with me
4152204	4152986	and many more.
4212782	4229348	Don't promise me a world that you can't figure out Don't promise me freedom Don't promise me a bridge
4230948	4244663	That you can't cross alone Don't promise me a life That you cannot turn on Don't promise me
4260234	4261114	Thanks for watching!
4302631	4304560	I've got MC confusion, I'm front a lot
4328780	4329561	Thank you for watching!
4348840	4350122	Thank you for watching!
4374071	4374651	on the mic.
4374832	4376793	Must be, yo, isn't Wendy Ron so tight?
4376893	4378894	You're having difficulty dredging out your brain.
4378914	4380835	The fact of which MC was that?
4380855	4381996	Which MC was that?
4382036	4383077	I can't recollect.
4383157	4387259	I heard him on the internet and it was MC Front or something but I didn't hit save.
4387299	4388520	Which MC was that?
4388580	4389241	I couldn't say.
4390662	4391322	I couldn't say.
4393516	4411136	StepUp, Poindex, The Axe Model, then you're all about to pull the MC name out the jar And whoever gets closest wins an iron-sided die and a gift certificate to prize, yo The moniker is MC Front a lot, I got a plus one bag, an earth core hip hop And my mail list busted, hundreds on famous, it's unbelievable nobody know what my name is
4419128	4421269	We are the damage of the sun
4456488	4460772	We are the landings for the sun We roll like hammocks from the sun We are the landings from the sun
4510231	4511732	We are the lemmings on the run.
4546192	4551996	Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.
4568044	4577086	Actually, now, Konami's kind of been trying to keep secrets about what they're going to be doing at... Oh, never mind, I thought you guys were talking to me.
4579847	4582428	They've been trying to keep quiet about some of the things they're going to be doing at E3.
4582948	4584128	You know, they like to surprise us.
4584228	4590810	I think in Konami's list... If they were trying to be quiet about it, why did they give it to GamePro?
4591010	4592991	Let me get there for a minute, damn you.
4593531	4593851	Alright.
4595094	4603499	So, usually, you know, they don't announce their stuff until it's getting closer to E3 time and, you know, they save most of their stuff for the show.
4603939	4605580	But this year, some of the stuff's gotten out early.
4607321	4607581	What's that?
4607721	4613324	IGN already blew the lid on the DDR with Mario is definitely going to be showing up.
4613444	4614985	And Karaoke Revolution 4.
4615285	4616866	And they also blew the lid on Karaoke Revolution 4.
4617666	4623916	and now what happened this week is that GamePro magazine, their website... Remember last year?
4623956	4624457	Yeah, I know.
4624537	4625378	That happened last year too.
4625398	4625759	Shame, shame.
4625779	4628563	Well, they spoiled all the unlocks on DDR Extreme last year.
4629004	4632089	And now what they did this year is they actually blew the lid on...
4633206	4634207	Some big things going on.
4634267	4637528	They actually have Ultramix 3 and Extreme 2.
4637828	4645532	And some very observant observers over on DDRFreak.com actually found these while they were surfing through GamePro's site.
4645552	4650054	So the first one that we have details leaked on was Ultramix 3.
4651035	4654817	Now again, I think most people assumed both these games were going to be coming.
4655097	4655658	Thanks for watching!
4672959	4676121	So I think Ultramix 3 especially are very curious to see what's going to happen with that.
4676621	4689987	So on the GamePro article, basically it reveals that there will be over 100 minutes of energetic dance music, and it's going to have over 65 songs, and I'm assuming that the downloads will still be accessible as well.
4690847	4700712	In fact, it does say it's compatible with all previous download song packs from DDR and DDR Ultramix 2, so that's 60 more songs right there, so that's 125 songs if you already have all these packs.
4701332	4701873	from the start.
4702213	4704855	Here are some of the new modes they're going to have in DDR Ultimix 3.
4705015	4706096	Freestyle mode.
4706637	4714042	And that will allow you to dance just the way you want to to any song in the game while rewarding you for doing different combinations.
4714463	4715564	It's like a freestyle mode.
4715604	4724411	So I think that just means you get to dance with no arrows, but maybe, I don't know if it's like a recording mode or it's rewarding you for doing certain things.
4724711	4730716	Like I think that's the impression I'm getting from it is that if you do certain step combos during it, you get rewarded.
4732003	4732744	Interesting, huh?
4733104	4733764	Yeah, no idea.
4733804	4737427	We can't really tell from the names alone, but that's pretty much all the article gives us right there.
4737947	4740309	So, there was that.
4741169	4741810	And, let's see.
4743811	4745452	Also, there's going to have quest mode.
4746053	4749975	Quest mode is basically, it's like a story mode now for DDR.
4750015	4752517	So, DDR is now getting... Yes, Toadie?
4753598	4754258	No, continue.
4754859	4756720	Quest mode, basically now... Yes?
4757501	4759362	Didn't they do this with Dance, Dance, Dance?
4759382	4759442	Yes.
4760053	4762394	Yeah, but how many people in this area know what that is?
4762554	4765375	I mean, seriously, how many people in the scene know what Dance Dance Dance is, even?
4765676	4766896	It was a really crappy game.
4767056	4768577	But now it's getting this quest mode.
4768877	4776961	You can travel virtually from city to city and build the ultimate dance team by completing challenging songs and routines along the way.
4777541	4780962	So it's basically a quest mode for DDR, like a story mode.
4781242	4782303	It's Pokemon DDR!
4782363	4784664	It's You Got Served the game.
4786945	4787485	Wow.
4788145	4789186	That makes me sad.
4789795	4790656	You know what, though?
4791858	4793019	It's cute, I guess.
4793220	4794421	I mean, it's cute.
4795042	4796404	I'm jaded, though, but...
4797267	4798347	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4821034	4824756	There's a whole library of dancing characters out there that haven't really been on the Xbox yet.
4824796	4832181	So I'm thinking maybe putting two and two together, that's probably what Story Mode is going to encompass is more of those characters.
4832201	4833862	And I'm hoping more original characters.
4833882	4842187	And I'm really, really hoping, because this is Konami of Hawaii, we will finally see the DDR PC characters cross over onto console.
4842807	4843568	And that's right.
4844268	4848791	They need to travel to San Francisco in Quest Mode and meet Betty and Mr. Spanky.
4851624	4852265	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4868462	4869403	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4890359	4892861	Jukebox Mode is another mode that's going to be in this game.
4893281	4901826	Jukebox Mode, this is a quote from the article, Jukebox Mode turns your Xbox into a music machine, allowing players to enjoy more than 65 tracks from the game.
4902947	4903287	Whatever.
4903787	4917296	It kind of sounds like a throwaway mode, but, well, you know, with DDR having the full screen videos and everything, maybe there will be more full screen videos in Ultramix, because there's only been like one video in each game.
4917336	4919257	We had to do that thing, which was...
4920029	4922331	Really, really homoerotic, by the way.
4922932	4925515	And then Tough Enough by Vanilla Ninja and Ultramix 2.
4926956	4928738	So hopefully there'll be more actual videos.
4928798	4931200	Even if not, think about it, 2DX6 style had a mode like this.
4932662	4935465	And it was well-received, so maybe there'll be something like that.
4936849	4937349	So we'll see.
4937709	4954393	Of course there will be workout mode and of course edit mode and we're just going to assume here and assume that it still has the be able to upload your own steps because it does say you can't upload content so we are assuming that to mean that you get to do your own steps again as well as online tournaments and Xbox Live Play.
4956154	4958534	So any thoughts on Ultramix 3?
4958894	4963055	Things that Ultramix 3 needs that Ultramix 2 and 1 didn't have?
4963616	4965036	It needs a Pocari Sweat Dispenser.
4965979	4967160	Come on, realistically.
4967460	4968941	Maybe in story mode you might see it.
4973445	4983012	You know, it's hard to think of new and innovative things to do with DDR in general.
4984633	4986214	Except they need freaking dance magic.
4988420	4994411	I want a first-person shooter minigame in this because every game should have a first-person shooter aspect to it.
4994451	4998739	Well, maybe in quest mode there'll be a, you know... I'm going to throw arrows at you.
4999420	5000923	Konami should take a cue from Namco.
5001553	5004594	You know, your loading screens, you can play little, you know, old Konami games.
5004634	5005455	You could play Gradius.
5005855	5009757	I was freaking playing the hell out of Starblade on the Tekken 5.
5009917	5012578	You could totally do Pac-Man or something on that pad.
5012918	5015880	You know, um... But that's more midway.
5016040	5018841	Ultramix had some real shitloading times, too, in the very beginning.
5018881	5020022	It takes forever for the game to boot.
5020242	5024604	And I don't know if it's because you go through, like, five copyright screens before you finally get to the actual game.
5025184	5030249	They're not all copyrighted, but you get one copyrighted screen, one screen that says Bomani, one screen that says all this garbage.
5030409	5036975	Like Yaya Kung Fu and Super Konami World and Castlevania.
5038976	5047704	Here's my thing, though, with Ultramix 3 is that I really, really, really hope they keep up their relationship with a different drummer.
5048484	5076922	and I've been saying this every place I possibly can because I really want to see this happen because I think the different drum music that we had in Ultramix 2 was seriously like the best thing to happen to DDR since DDR I don't know it was the best so I really hope they are going to continue that relationship with a different drum or at least even if not that label specifically that whole idea of finding independent musicians who make just as damn good music as anybody else and put it in the game to make big honestly
5077854	5081998	You know, honestly, I just forgot what I was going to say.
5082799	5083179	Okay.
5084140	5094771	I was sort of just, it's trying to wrap my mind around a whole, I guess, RPG mode in a DDR game.
5095983	5098906	I still have flashbacks to Dance Dance Dance, and that game was horrible.
5111164	5112385	This is going to suck.
5113005	5117187	And now I believe Ultramix 2 is the best home release we've had on any system, period.
5119308	5121790	And it kind of stank at E3 last year.
5121890	5125792	So it's going to be interesting to see exactly how much we get to see this year at E3.
5125832	5127073	I don't know.
5127253	5127573	We'll see.
5127973	5138900	and also, you know, another good thing that Ultramix has been pretty good on is providing us with new, like, 10s for those folks that like the challenge and just, you know, and I'm looking at you, Toadie, the people that just can't enjoy DDR without there being 10-footers in it.
5138960	5145104	Well, it's not that I can't enjoy it, it's the fact that you'll come out with some new song and you'll make it a 7-footer.
5145464	5151568	I mean, during, I was with Loki when we were testing out DDR Extreme US and I think it was...
5153382	5159561	And I think I AAA'd like half of the new songs on the first try with the bigger timing windows and I'm like, okay, now what?
5160637	5161878	What am I going to do with this?
5163760	5165521	Add a challenge difficulty or something.
5165541	5167783	I mean, you have four difficulties to work with.
5167983	5171506	You can make one of those difficult to suit everybody.
5171806	5180032	You have to remember, though, Tony, on the bell of players that these games are made to, you could imagine it on a graph that looks like an upside-down U, a bell curve.
5180392	5182954	You are way on the bottom over here.
5183014	5185296	You are one of the few that they need to cater to.
5186137	5188078	Just make a challenge difficulty.
5188699	5188999	It's
5189488	5191449	I'll design the damn steps myself.
5191469	5192029	I mean, come on.
5192069	5194750	There's more than enough people that would be willing to do it.
5195190	5195551	You know?
5195651	5197531	You have four difficulties or whatever.
5197591	5200072	Just make one hard one.
5200473	5200873	We'll see.
5200913	5201273	We'll see.
5201373	5204074	Anyway, so we will see what happens with quest mode a little later on.
5204134	5207335	Of course, as we get more details, we'll post it to our website, orangelaundry.com.
5207856	5208996	DDR Freak as well.
5209156	5211237	They've got lots and lots of news on this stuff.
5211317	5214218	And all the other sites out there, I'm sure, are reporting on this as well.
5214538	5216999	Speaking of DDR Freak, I want to mention this at some point during the show.
5217340	5217900	Friday nights...
5218540	5221121	on DDR Freak Radio are actually replays of this show.
5221221	5225602	So to those of you guys who are actually hearing this the first time on Friday Night DDR Freak, hello, and thanks for listening.
5226662	5230063	So check that out over on The Freak, as we so lovingly call it here on this show.
5232164	5235085	Anything else on Ultramix you guys want to add in?
5235245	5235465	Okay.
5236505	5239906	We're going to talk about Extreme 2, but first we're going to have ourselves a little bit of a cage match.
5239926	5241127	We've got to get to that at some point tonight.
5241347	5243087	Can you believe how fast this show is going by tonight?
5243627	5245528	This is what happens when you actually have news to talk about.
5247112	5250053	Midnight Tune 2 or something like that.
5274500	5278924	It's some arcade racing game, and it was Nothing Lives Forever.
5279744	5284508	Starring Paul O'Terry, and it was a guy that did the music from Act Raiders.
5285129	5285930	Alright, sounds good.
5287192	5290396	Okay, so we're going to play a clip from this one because it was last week's winner.
5290416	5292899	And then it's going to go up against two brand new songs.
5293279	5295482	And you guys, in our chatroom, get to vote.

5304813	5306794	This one's been sitting here for a long time.
5397196	5399703	Thank you for watching!
5429424	5432907	I am the reacher What you need?
5483221	5485623	Alright, that was a clip there of song number one.
5485663	5488424	That was Politary, Nothing Lives Forever.
5488985	5491326	Alright, song number two is my song tonight.
5492147	5498371	And, you know, lately I've been kind of downloading these random British trance and dance compilations.
5498411	5500232	I'm just like, I just want more dance music.
5500272	5500952	Gimme, gimme, gimme.
5501713	5504454	So, I found this one and I kind of like this one.
5504514	5506496	It's a little bit poppy, but...
5507336	5514244	I just like it, so I'm putting it in the cage match, because I think you guys will like it too, and I think this is like total DDR songs, so we'll see.
5514364	5520450	This artist is named Diamond, somebody I've never heard of, but this is the artist Diamond, and the song is Reason.
5520530	5521031	Enjoy, you guys.
5541056	5561438	Something in the air, I don't know why You were hardly there when I was on my own There's something about you that makes me cry
5657560	5658822	Thanks for watching!
5728754	5732435	All right, boys and girls, that was song number two tonight, Diamond with Reason.
5732495	5736616	Let's go around and see what everybody thought, if they had a reason to love it or a reason to despise it.
5737016	5737576	DarkSakura.
5739217	5742717	I hate to say it was pretty generic, not too exciting.
5743778	5750719	It was good, it was solid, but generic, so it gets a five and a half.
5751462	5751942	Five and a half.
5752563	5752823	Loki.
5753644	5754164	It was okay.
5754624	5769135	It reminded me of the bass line, it reminded me of something from Run Lola Run, but then it sounded like some other song I heard of, and so it's, I don't know, it's just kind of, it's not bad, it just sounds familiar.
5770176	5772738	And then, so I give it a seven.
5773206	5779890	And then I give the porn on my PSP a 10 Which you were putting on cam during that song Yes I did You know what I think the familiarity is?
5779930	5782011	Somebody pointed this out in the chatroom Who said this?
5782051	5801643	Because I totally agree with what they said I apologize to who said this because I can't Oh, Fireboma said It has a very Lasco feeling to it Oh no, Zaku said it first Legend of Zaku said it has a very Lasco sound to it I kind of agree It sounds like them Which is interesting because Lasco actually had a song on this exact same CD But it sounded like totally unlike them So go figure
5802383	5803183	Anyway, I like it.
5803264	5803884	It's poppy.
5804104	5807065	I think somebody said they could sing along to it.
5807105	5807865	I feel the same way.
5808105	5810626	It's a drive in my car and sing and feel happy and pretty.
5811347	5811847	So I give it an 8.
5813447	5813707	Toadie.
5816348	5818889	I was in the bathroom and I missed about half the song.
5819750	5821130	It sounded pretty generic to me.
5821150	5824632	Like I said, I only caught the last third of it or so.
5825612	5828493	But... I don't know.
5828533	5830854	It didn't strike me as anything particularly...
5832074	5832755	Outstanding.
5832795	5833696	I'll give it a six.
5834537	5834917	Alrighty.
5835098	5839803	But... I was in the kitchen and it sounded like standard pop.
5840925	5842406	And, yeah, nothing terribly exciting.
5842486	5842767	Six.
5844128	5846591	It's definitely driving the car, singing along, be gay, all that.
5846611	5847692	Yeah, yeah, thanks.
5848634	5849435	I do that too, just...
5850100	5850640	You be gay?
5850941	5851241	Alright.
5851902	5852582	Gayest and happy.
5853002	5853543	Yes, exactly.
5853623	5854043	Alright, alright.
5854764	5856786	Anyway, let's move on.
5856986	5859208	There is one more song you guys get to vote for tonight.
5859248	5859628	Here it is.
5859768	5860749	It's Jamie's pick.
5860769	5862170	Jamie, what did you pick for us tonight?
5862810	5866393	I'm sure people have heard this on my Tuesday show, Plug Plug.
5866674	5874260	But this is a song off of the CD called Demo Crazy, which was by Damon Auburn of Blur, also the guy behind Gorillaz.
5875034	5876034	Big surprise, huh?
5876875	5880696	But this is a remix of a song off of that album called A Rappy Song.
5881197	5882137	It's really out there.
5882317	5884598	You know, the title alone makes me think of PSO.
5884918	5885378	Am I just a nerd?
5885398	5885939	All rappies?
5886419	5889240	Am I just a nerd because I think of rag rappies?
5889500	5892321	Well, the thing is... Keep in mind, I haven't heard the song yet.
5892421	5893342	How's this for nerdy?
5893862	5896823	There actually is... Oh, your mic just went off.
5897748	5898028	Hello?
5898088	5898449	There you are.
5898969	5904534	There is an item called an Alrapi that you could use to boost your stats and the developers were using it for game testing.
5904955	5905095	Oh.
5905435	5906636	And I've got some.
5907857	5908157	Cheater.
5908418	5910099	I cheated PSO and I'm proud of it.
5910420	5911200	Alright, here we go.
5911260	5914924	Song number three tonight, Damon Albrin with A Rapi Song, the remix.
5914964	5915184	Enjoy.
5934649	5936090	Thank you for watching!
5998458	6006022	I can't believe you have to stay behind me, go beyond and talk to me baby, tell me why, so now your people can try to follow me, programming your fear to die.
6041676	6042597	Thank you for watching!
6115458	6119941	Song number three, Damon Albren with a Rappi song, the remix.
6120341	6122222	Did you think it was Rappi or Crappi?
6122642	6123323	DarkSakura.
6124543	6127385	I'm just really pissed off at the people who are being fucking rude about all of these songs.
6128306	6132208	So I'm giving it... Don't let them ruffle your feathers.
6132288	6135530	No, the thing is that I see this week after week, and this is bullshit.
6136050	6139772	You know, we are doing this show for you people, and the least you can do is be nice, okay?
6140373	6143755	So I give the chat room a negative 50, and I give my song a 10.
6144634	6145655	All right, Loki.
6146336	6147417	I didn't care for this song.
6148719	6149139	Not at all.
6150842	6151382	Gets a four.
6153805	6155067	I thought it was kind of quirky.
6156328	6158370	I don't know, it had a nice groove to it, though.
6158411	6163817	I can't say I didn't like it, because I thought it was kind of groovy and it made me bounce, so that's worth something, so I give it a seven.
6164277	6164538	Toadie.
6165782	6166823	Yeah, I got to agree with that.
6166843	6171606	I mean, it was pretty damn weird, but I noticed I was sitting there, like, you know, bouncing, you know, my head to it.
6172526	6174267	Yeah, it's quirky.
6174448	6176549	Yeah, it was something I think I could listen to.
6176589	6177009	I'd give it an 8.
6177309	6177990	I liked that one.
6178410	6178730	Alrighty.
6179111	6179351	Bug!
6182453	6182873	I'd give it a 7.
6183133	6185455	It was definitely something you can bop along to.
6186135	6186435	Alright.
6187196	6187556	Alright!
6188058	6192279	That being said, let's recap the three songs you can vote for tonight in tonight's cage match.
6192319	6197980	Song number one you can vote for is Politary with No One Lives Forever, I think.
6198920	6199240	Yes!
6199580	6200200	Okay, thank you.
6203221	6203741	Where's my clip?
6203761	6204601	There we go.
6212362	6216443	All right, and song number two you can vote for tonight is Diamond with Reason.
6227550	6231673	And song number three you can vote for tonight is Damon Albren with a rappy song.
6232214	6234676	Alright guys, place vote now.
6234716	6237037	Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.
6237057	6240140	Song number one, song number two, or song number three.
6254602	6259464	Hurry, hurry, hurry, get your votes in now, because we don't leave the window open very long, so send those in.
6260324	6263745	If you're not sure how to do that, ask somebody in chat, they will help you out, because they're nice.
6264445	6267987	Alright, this is the part of the show where I usually ask Loki what's going on in the sim scene.
6268027	6269507	So, Loki, what's going on in the sim scene?
6269787	6271648	As far as I'm aware, nothing.
6272608	6276190	And I'm double-checking to make sure, you know, that that's not the case.
6277170	6278871	I would hope that there's something going on.
6281551	6282072	Anyways...
6284710	6306054	No, really, um, I don't think there is anything going on as far as, um, releases go, because I was checking the other day for, um, some brand new, you know, the food mix stuff, see if there's any, um, you know, new stuff for that, but, um, no, no, there, there wasn't, so, but like I said, I'm double checking right now.
6307014	6307915	I should have done this earlier.
6309495	6313656	Um, whatever, you know, honestly, it doesn't matter.
6314416	6314516	Um,
6316127	6318469	But anyways, let's see here.
6320551	6323533	You might check out DDRUK since they're still coming about.
6323853	6330759	And I'm sure they're working on still the... What was it?
6333881	6336083	The brand new SimFiles 4, I think.
6336263	6339305	I think they're finishing up Ultramix 2 or something.
6339346	6341287	They're the song packs for Ultramix 2.
6342048	6343048	Last time I checked.
6343409	6343509	Um...
6345606	6352748	But really, other than that, you're not going to find much new stuff out there because there really isn't that much new stuff coming around.
6352888	6357849	I'm seeing if there's any developments in the food mix thing here.
6358209	6358629	I wish.
6358969	6360409	Food mix 2 needs to come out.
6361209	6363210	Needs to come out now.
6363290	6364970	Are they actually doing a food mix 2?
6365370	6365590	Yep.
6365910	6366570	Oh, hot.
6368371	6369911	I reported that a while ago.
6370631	6371251	No, but anyways.
6372352	6372852	I forgot.
6372952	6373612	Okay, kill me.
6374992	6376572	No, here's what's going on.
6376913	6382254	Looks like DDRCNC style selection from Beat Mario.
6384294	6387435	Their webpage is updated, whatever that's supposed to mean.
6388576	6389036	I don't know.
6389056	6390556	It doesn't say anything.
6390716	6391836	So guess what, folks?
6391916	6393297	That means nothing's going on.
6393697	6394057	Nada.
6394497	6397678	Just some more shitty sim files, Bavani style.
6399195	6400755	But hey, you can't blame it on myself.
6400955	6404836	How many Max remixes posted in the last day?
6405296	6406797	Let's find out, shall we?
6407737	6414718	No, honestly, um... I haven't seen that many Max remixes lately.
6414738	6417079	I actually haven't seen any Max remixes lately.
6417099	6424480	I think they may be just not even trying to make them with any structure whatsoever.
6424580	6427121	The ones I've seen have been like these stupid boss files.
6428389	6436893	and those are really crappy, but just for shits and giggles, let's see how many Max remixes there are since the last time we broadcast.
6437473	6438033	I vote 20.
6439614	6439854	You think 20?
6440034	6440194	Okay.
6443856	6445317	And the winner is...
6447472	6451956	Starion Survivor Max Starion Survivor Max
6475862	6482447	Starion, Survivor, Rizla, Max, Deep, Dynamite, Max Attack, Trip Machine, Climax, Max Period,
6489349	6502056	Max420, LOL, DJ, OB, VI, DJ Vicious, eat your heart out, some joke file, and Max Unlimited, edit, and then Max Wipeout version 2.
6503857	6505818	Honestly, folks, none of this stuff's worth downloading.
6506518	6508019	Just save your time.
6509180	6510801	Do something more constructive like download porn.
6511021	6511341	Seriously.
6511781	6516784	Honestly, there's a lot more porn out there than sim files, and you know what?
6516824	6518805	With porn, you can never get bad porn, so that's
6519431	6520092	That's good to know.
6521473	6521794	All right.
6522715	6523155	Anything else?
6524297	6529243	I say, you know, make porn, not, you know, bad Maxim files.
6529403	6532286	That's what... Actually, no, I don't want to see anyone making porn.
6532667	6534028	Please don't make your own porn.
6534228	6534669	Don't, don't.
6535029	6536631	Especially considering most of you are under 18.
6536731	6537672	Don't do that!
6538113	6539394	That would be illegal.
6539515	6539795	All right.
6540137	6542199	We are going to open up the Skype line in a little bit, guys.
6542259	6544601	I want to start talking about Xtreme 2 a little bit, though.
6544621	6547544	But if you do want to get in on the Skype line, let me tell you this.
6547945	6550767	I know that tons of people want to get in tonight.
6550948	6552009	So be ready.
6552669	6553830	www.
6553910	6557654	I've actually got emails of people that want to get in, like, or wanting me to open it up special for them.
6557714	6559436	So you're going to have to go against them.
6559676	6561498	www.OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
6561578	6563820	Click on Interact With Us and get your program ready.
6565640	6568341	Anyway, I want to talk about Extreme 2 real quick.
6568421	6576863	Now, the person that found DDR Ultramix 3 was this person, Tep, over on DDR Freak.
6577363	6591567	And then after Tep found out about the Ultramix 3, one of the admins over there, Cutris, actually went over and started kind of, I guess, scouring GamePro's site a little bit and found out that GamePro also spilled the beans on Extreme 2!
6592387	6592627	Oops.
6594082	6606691	Oops, they did it again, and I say that for a reason, because one of the big shockers in this article is that Dance Dance Revolution Extreme 2 will have Genie in a Bottle and Oops, I Did It Again as confirmed songs.
6610613	6616177	Now, I know this thrills DarkSakura to no end here, considering how she feels about that type of music.
6616197	6617198	Isn't that Jenny in a Bottle?
6617918	6618959	It's not Jenny in a Bottle.
6618979	6620440	How about Shit in a Bag?
6622401	6623242	Set that on fire.
6625969	6629570	Alright, so that was one big revolution, or revolution, revelation made.
6630570	6633531	Again, they're saying over 100 minutes of dance music going to be in there.
6634312	6647216	And they're saying, this is what GamePro is saying now, keep in mind that I believe it was them or somebody said this last year and it didn't really happen, but they are saying PlayStation 2 owners will be able to go head-to-head with a new online feature.
6647717	6648737	So the online thing,
6650469	6657152	The Online Thing doing so well in Ultramix 2 that now it's going to be a part of Extreme 2 as well.
6657672	6658732	Very interesting, I think.
6661193	6663654	As if you didn't know enough stupid people on Xbox Live.
6663734	6667296	Now you get to meet them on PlayStation 2, which opens up a whole new world of stupid people.
6669147	6683400	And then that's about it, although we do know that iToySupport is coming back, and as well... Yeah, iToySupport's coming back, and let's see... Workout mode is coming as well, and you get to do your own steps in edit mode, of course, as well.
6683861	6684902	So, that's about it.
6684942	6690387	The online mode being the biggest thing about that, as well as the Genie in a Bottle and Oops, I Did It Again.
6690807	6691028	So...
6692429	6694090	This goes back to what I said earlier.
6694110	6695531	Remember I said I'd mention this again.
6695952	6698674	Remember, boys and girls, DDR Extreme is not made for you.
6698914	6702597	It's made partially for you, and you'll get something out of it.
6702617	6704158	You'll get your Sakura, I'm sure.
6704559	6708301	I don't know anything for sure, but I think it's a given that Sakura will probably show up in this one.
6709002	6712845	But now, for the Slumber Party girls, they're going to have genie in a bottle and oops, I did it again.
6712985	6713205	Deal.
6713646	6721692	And you also have to remember that none of these girls usually, I shouldn't say none, a very small percentage of these nine-year-old Slumber Party girls are going to play on heavy, but...
6722247	6727352	Konami is going to give them 7 foot steps with 200 steps on heavy anyway.
6727832	6731116	Wouldn't it be comedy gold though if they made Genie in a Bottle like a 10 footer?
6731276	6733017	I would actually probably buy the game.
6735560	6736461	Just as a joke.
6738177	6739578	But this is interesting.
6739618	6741938	If it's online, then people can create their own steps.
6741958	6745260	So you know there's going to be 10-foot steps out there to oops, I did it again, but they'll be crap.
6745580	6750421	It'll be like finger-finger revolution stuff where it's like, oops, I did it again.
6750701	6753182	Let's make no sense.
6753402	6758344	Just a big string of 16th notes that go in random, no sensical order whatsoever.
6758884	6760525	Much like many in the groove 12-footers.
6761705	6764426	Or they'll just go in and add triplets, which don't go to anything.
6766167	6766347	So...
6768396	6769116	Very interesting.
6770817	6772198	It was actually EGM.
6772718	6773579	Thank you for the tip there.
6773939	6778041	EGM was actually the one that said that online play would be included last year, and they were wrong.
6778301	6779582	But now GamePro is saying it this year.
6780182	6783144	And hopefully, I don't know.
6783164	6784845	Do you think online play is a good thing for DDR?
6784865	6785465	I think it's a bad thing.
6787246	6789068	Are you asking me that specifically?
6789808	6791089	Or are you asking the chat room?
6792209	6794171	I guess anybody in the room that wants to answer that.
6794711	6796672	We'll do the Skype line thing later for those who want to ask.
6797273	6804557	Well, it's pretty much impossible for them to tell who's using a controller and who's using a pad.
6804617	6811661	I mean, it's really not worth my time to try and put forth a bunch of... Well, now Xbox Live will tell you who's using a controller.
6811721	6816243	I was actually under the impression that they had some sort of system that allowed them to bypass that.
6817424	6820065	I think everybody will hack anything.
6820085	6820165	Yeah.
6820589	6821570	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6843306	6845288	For 99% of players, it's not going to matter.
6845388	6848370	Yeah, I mean, I guess for the people that can't get out to an arcade, it's great.
6848410	6849891	I mean, for me, I would never use it.
6849931	6853073	I'd just rather go to my local arcade or whatever and play people.
6853274	6866103	But this is interesting because this kind of ties into what you were talking about in the last show, Loki, is you were talking about this is where DDR is going, is that because the arcades are dying and nobody seems to care anymore, online mode is where it's going to.
6866203	6868004	So does this news surprise you at all, Loki?
6868045	6868605	I'm kind of curious.
6869265	6869966	No, but...
6870185	6873207	Then again, they need more things to be on their network adapter.
6873868	6875889	After all, they don't want to be like the GameCube.
6877751	6878551	Well, now, who knows?
6878591	6883535	There might be some big thing that comes down with DDR with Mario, which is the one game we didn't get a new news on this week.
6884496	6885817	Very soon, though.
6885917	6886557	Think about it, guys.
6886597	6887938	We're only a week and a half away.
6887958	6893102	Honestly, folks, do you really think you're going to get online play with anything on the GameCube?
6893322	6893562	No.
6893903	6895204	You'll get LAN play.
6895744	6896805	Hello, LAN play.
6898346	6898926	Enjoy me.
6899127	6899727	Maybe, maybe.
6900652	6902892	Yeah, I wouldn't expect to get online play of DDR with Mario.
6902913	6905633	It would be very weird because DDR with Mario.
6905673	6907193	Stupid kids don't know how to use the internet.
6907213	6908234	What the hell are we talking about?
6910394	6910714	Alright.
6910994	6911434	Honestly.
6912355	6913095	Damn Mario.
6913235	6915515	Fucking A. Why doesn't he plumb something?
6915535	6923757	I mean, honestly, he's been doing a lot of, like, macking on princesses and, like, smashing turtles, but I haven't actually seen him, you know, unclog a toilet.
6925488	6927090	He just unclogs the princess all the time.
6927710	6931454	No, they unclog the pipes of all of those monsters in Mario Brothers.
6931534	6932375	He cleans her pipes.
6932395	6933336	He cleans her pipes.
6935538	6937359	Waxes.
6937600	6938440	With his plunger.
6939802	6940082	God.
6941308	6942469	We've sunk that low.
6942589	6943110	Yes, we have.
6943770	6947713	All right, I think that's a sign that we probably should reveal the cage match winner.
6947733	6949454	Are you guys ready to hear about the cage match winner tonight?
6949774	6950174	I don't care.
6950215	6950575	Why not?
6950955	6953897	Tons of people voted in tonight's cage match.
6953957	6956239	I think this is one of the largest turnouts we've had in a while.
6956659	6960442	And the winning song won by only two votes, if you can believe that.
6960742	6961702	You want to hear the song that won?
6963283	6963804	We'll see.
6965605	6967707	Damon Aldrin with a crappy song.
6967807	6968267	Oh, shit!
6970100	6972022	No, I'm really fucking surprised.
6972802	6973182	You know what?
6973263	6981349	I think what happened, because the other songs had the exact same number of votes, I think the trance vote got split and it allowed the quirk thing to go through.
6981689	6987634	Either that or after you spanked everybody in the chat room, they voted for you out of fear.
6988034	6992177	No, seriously, all I wanted was for people just to be a little bit more open.
6992277	6993398	And it wasn't just for me.
6993438	6995760	They were bitching about everything that went through.
6995780	6997462	So I was like, stop bitching.
6997522	6998342	Just listen.
6998763	6999063	You know what?
7000219	7001860	People will bitch about everything.
7001920	7002800	So the internet's for us.
7002820	7003260	You know what?
7003881	7005702	As an internet celebrity, you're going to have to deal with this.
7007082	7007502	I know.
7008323	7012005	There's going to be paparazzi out there that are going to photograph you when you're feeling fat.
7012025	7018468	But like any celebrity, I have to throw a temper tantrum every so often so they can be on the cover of the star.
7018508	7018868	Okay.
7019428	7022970	And then I can sue them for money for something.
7023010	7023770	You know what we need?
7023850	7026151	We need like an internet version of the star.
7027012	7027932	And we should be in it.
7028692	7030593	It has to be a flattering story.
7030813	7032514	No fat pictures of me.
7033275	7034695	Nude sunbathing or anything like that.
7036016	7038798	How about we make a website called fakenews.com?
7039078	7040379	They probably already have it.
7040419	7041439	That's why we're not going to make it.
7042100	7043060	Alright, let me check.
7043200	7045722	Hey, moviepoopshoot.com is still around.
7045742	7046242	Oh my god.
7048775	7056462	Alright, we're going to go to a break, and when we come back from this break, it's your show, boys and girls, and I always fear this part of the show when I let it be their show.
7056522	7056742	Ha!
7057062	7058984	There is no fakenews.com.
7059224	7060765	We will make it happen.
7061226	7062567	Somebody's going to get to it before you.
7062647	7062987	We'll see.
7064471	7065633	Anyway guys, we're going to go to a break.
7065653	7069478	When we come back, it's your show because we are going to open up the Skype line right after this.
7069958	7076527	In this break though, you get music from, I figure since we've done a lot of home stuff tonight, we're going to do Ultramix 2 in this break.
7076627	7079711	So enjoy this selection of music from Ultramix 2 and we'll be back after this.

7525626	7526867	Orange Lounge Radio.
7527187	7529349	We put your thing down, flip it, and reverse it.
7529369	7531110	God, that's lame.
7531170	7532911	All right, we're back here.
7540334	7567954	with Orange Lounge Radio and it's your turn boys and girls we're going to open up the skype line for you guys to get in and call and give us your opinion on what's going on if you want more information on how to get in www.orangeloungeradio.com and click on interact with us and you too can be on the skype line let's take our first call hello you're on Orange Lounge Radio hello Sky it's El Mullet calling hello El Mullet how are you
7571127	7572349	Good, how about yourself?
7572549	7575753	Good, I think we have a little bit of a delay, so start talking.
7575793	7576454	What's on your mind?
7579898	7587607	Well, basically, now that we've got the news on Extreme 2 and Ultramix 3, I'm starting to get pretty pumped for this year's E3.
7589071	7591232	I am absolutely pumped for this year's E3.
7591272	7608263	When you consider that we have Extreme 2 and we have Ultramix 3 and we have DDR with Mario and we have Karaoke Revolution 4 and we have God knows whatever Red Octane's going to show and whatever Korean crap shows up in Kenshiya Hall, this is going to be a beautiful E3 for us music gamers.
7608283	7608824	I'm very happy.
7611826	7615488	This is going to be the best year for music games period.
7616429	7618430	And I do have something to say for all the
7619557	7621578	Yes, what would you like to say?
7623680	7645733	I was going to say anything, what I wanted to say to all the naysayers, to all the people who decided to come out and bitch right out of the gate as soon as the announcements were made, shut up, you don't know what's going to be on these games outside of Genie and Oops, and that's two songs out of a possible 65 plus song mix, shut up.
7648081	7652482	I agree, I agree, those people just need to sit down and shut up until we have more information on the game.
7652842	7658004	You want to know why no company wants to release information on games before E3?
7658364	7673708	It's because this is what people do with, you know, any game that has a loyal fan base, is that people start just tearing the shit apart, and they dream up this own list in their head of everything they want, or the game's gonna suck, and then, you know, they're disappointed because the developers have a different vision.
7674049	7675149	So, you want to know why
7675889	7678932	Everybody keeps it in their pants until E3.
7678972	7679513	This is why.
7679853	7680714	It's a perfect example.
7680994	7684738	Go look at the thread and everybody bitching.
7688521	7688922	Any thoughts?
7689843	7695168	Why can't it be like arcades that have all my favorite songs on them?
7695588	7698290	Where's my Max Period from the other home version?
7699150	7701231	God, some people piss me off.
7701411	7703471	This game better have Sakura.
7703631	7706232	I'm not buying this game unless Sakura is in it.
7707553	7708433	Jesus, people.
7708533	7713174	Sakura is like the most horrid song in DDR Extreme.
7713995	7716555	I will not buy this game unless Sakura is not in it.
7716735	7716976	Ha!
7718256	7718836	Got you.
7720417	7721657	Sakura makes everything cool.
7724444	7728807	I want as much licensed mainstream crap as humanly possible.
7730008	7740254	I want to see people so pissed off at this year's song list that steam is coming out of their ears while I sit back, copy of Extreme 2, laughing my ass off.
7740615	7740915	That's right.
7740955	7744177	You know what kind of... Let's dream for a minute here.
7744257	7748340	Let's think about if I were to make DDR Extreme 2.
7749100	7750061	Let's think for a minute here.
7750641	7751782	What types of songs...
7752879	7756703	What I want to put in Extreme 2, let me think, I'm going to make my mix here for a minute here.
7758425	7763650	Let's see, so I would definitely have Oops I Did It Again, and Genie in a Bottle would definitely have to be in this.
7764491	7769156	And I was trying to queue up some musical stuff, but my thing is frozen.
7769176	7770498	There we go, there we go, thank you.
7771018	7771639	Okay, let's see.
7771659	7774502	Uh-oh, did the feed drop?
7777351	7778772	I think we're still here.
7779152	7779853	I'm still with you.
7779873	7781634	There may be a delay, but I'm still with you.
7781795	7784957	I think we had a spot of downtime there, but we're back.
7785338	7785798	Who cares?
7785818	7787540	We were just, like, rambling.
7789722	7794406	The internet declined your request of making a custom DVR mix.
7795427	7795947	Sorry, Rob.
7796308	7797048	Yeah, I guess so.
7797128	7798810	The internet just didn't want that to happen.
7799030	7799370	My bad.
7799410	7800812	Oh, this must not happen!
7801711	7805284	I think it was live 365 because we never disconnected.
7809704	7810725	I'm not sure what happened there, guys.
7810765	7812826	All right, let's just keep rolling here because the archives are going.
7813947	7820511	So I guess if you want to hear what happened during the chaos moment there, just listen to the DDR Freak archive because it'll all be there.
7821452	7824493	Actually, I think if any of you guys are on the net, I need you to stop what you're doing.
7824654	7826155	Stop your uploads and stop whatever you're doing.
7826215	7827535	Close any programs that are connected to the internet.
7827575	7829537	Oh, man, so much for my six-bit torrent.
7829577	7830517	We need all the bandwidth right now.
7831418	7831638	Is it?
7831838	7832479	Okay, all right.
7833459	7834340	We never disconnected.
7834580	7835300	It's live 365.
7835340	7836221	They've done this to me, too.
7836401	7836661	Okay.
7836881	7838082	It's the goddamn government.
7838122	7839163	They're hacksering us.
7841576	7845217	I am showing the stations up on the air and streaming, so it's just going to take them a minute to get in.
7845397	7847437	Oh my god, they shut off the monitor!
7847577	7848417	Let's do this.
7848557	7848917	Let's go.
7849057	7850978	Mullet, why don't I give you a call right back?
7851158	7852298	We're going to go to a music break, okay?
7854218	7854818	Mullet, are you still there?
7855658	7856579	They killed Mullet!
7856819	7857659	Oh my god!
7858099	7859919	Okay, we're going to go to a music break and come right back, okay?
7859979	7860779	I'm not dead!
7861539	7862280	We'll call you back.
7864800	7867180	Okay, so we're going to go to a music break real quick here.
7867280	7870741	If you guys are with us, we are going to go to a break here while everything is...
7871129	7873591	being burned and destroyed and it's awful.
7873751	7875332	Oh my god, the choppers.
7875452	7879555	Oh no, the government guys with their cell phones are going to signal us to death.
7880576	7881717	I think I have a very... DP reference.
7881737	7881877	Cancer!
7884110	7890355	I have a very appropriate song for this break, too, and it's actually topical, so people reconnecting during this downtime will find this to be hilarious.
7890395	7897601	See, perhaps, though, they were just thinking that, you know, ET wanted the phone home, so they were just providing him with the walkie-talkie that he could do that with.
7898081	7900763	They were just trying to be helpful instead of hurtful.
7901564	7903405	Let's take a minute out and come back, okay?
7904046	7904566	Ah, fine.
7948690	7970738	I think I did it again I made you believe We're more than just friends Oh baby
7988045	7990897	I played with your heart Got lost in this game Oh baby
8040976	8041838	Thanks for watching!
8087597	8090600	All right, we are back here on Orange Launch Radio, and an appropriate choice there.
8090660	8094284	We played the fifth mix version of Oops, I Did It Again during our little downtime there.
8095085	8095866	Sorry about that.
8095986	8096807	I don't know what happened.
8096887	8108659	I think a combination of Live 365 did a net fart, and then I was trying to launch iTunes because I was going to do a gag because Elmullet and I were talking about songs that we would like to see on DDR Extreme 2.
8108859	8110521	Surprise, an Apple product crashing.
8111710	8117755	So actually, what I'm going to do now, I know a lot of you guys are actually calling in, but I do want to give Elmullet a proper chance to say goodbye.
8117775	8118795	So we're calling him right back.
8118835	8119696	Hi, Elmullet, you there?
8121557	8122258	I'm here, Sky.
8122298	8122758	How's it going?
8122858	8123099	Good.
8123159	8124960	I think we still have a little bit of that delay, but that's okay.
8124980	8126441	Elmullet, live from the Middle East.
8128162	8129764	So I don't know what happened there.
8130024	8136368	But actually, I have to say, the best comment, one of the best comments I've ever seen in our chat room came during that break.
8136849	8140652	And somebody said, who has a dark tetsuya, said, it's the rapture.
8144139	8147440	Like we'd be the ones disappearing during the rapture.
8148080	8149420	All right, anyway, so El Mullet.
8151080	8158001	In my dream fantasy extreme, too, I was going to get to, I was going to do audio clips, but iTunes decided to kill my computer.
8158942	8165863	We have, I would have, oops, I did it again, Genie in a Bottle, My Prerogative, the New My New My A song has to be in there for sure.
8166523	8169263	Venga Boys, We Like to Party, definitely would be in there as well.
8169603	8170864	Alice DJ, Better Off Alone.
8171804	8172304	Madonna...
8173484	8176106	Old School Madonna and New School Madonna would definitely have to be in it.
8176607	8178188	And let's see, what else would be in there?
8178388	8180149	Somebody told me, because you know that.
8180169	8183391	Yeah, somebody told me that you had a boyfriend who looked like a girlfriend and all that stuff.
8184052	8188475	And then we would definitely have to have all of the American Idols as well.
8188575	8189576	Oh my God, we need Clay.
8190116	8190556	And Clay.
8190576	8191257	Because he's hot.
8192357	8193058	Clay is hot.
8193078	8193979	If I was invisible.
8194299	8194499	Step.
8195143	8195763	Oh, it'd be great.
8195803	8200244	And they'd all have ten-footers, and so, you know, it'd be invisible.
8200484	8200724	Anyway.
8201065	8201705	I'll tell you this.
8201765	8206966	If I'm interrupting, there would be fifth mix.
8207466	8210967	It would all be fifth mix plus random add-ons.
8212608	8213448	I like the idea.
8213468	8213928	It would be glorious.
8214188	8214928	I like the idea of DDR2.
8214948	8218609	I would be the only one who would buy the copy because, well, let's face it.
8221870	8222050	Yeah.
8222810	8223351	Go lag.
8223631	8225913	I know, we have horrible, horrible lag tonight.
8226293	8227534	So, oh well.
8227594	8230037	Yeah, I agree with the idea that Fifth Mix would rock.
8231118	8232299	Let's just pour Fifth Mix in.
8232359	8234240	Let's try to get all the original versions of song, too.
8234300	8236102	Let's get the original, like, tribal dance and all that stuff.
8236122	8236522	That'd be great.
8237443	8239065	But we have to have the new My New My A song in there.
8239085	8239325	Come on.
8240496	8243638	I'm sorry, I'm going to have to go.
8243678	8244719	This delay is horrible.
8244799	8245579	I'll try this again.
8245599	8246019	That's all right.
8246039	8246820	Have a good one, Mollet.
8246860	8247680	Very, very sorry.
8247700	8248060	That's all right.
8248080	8248681	Have a good one, Mollet.
8248881	8250502	Take care, and I'll plug it for him.
8250582	8254184	InsidePulse.com is super duper, so visit it.
8254564	8256145	I know what song needs to be in there.
8256225	8256425	What?
8257786	8258607	The Muppet one.
8259187	8259447	Manamana.
8259567	8260127	Manamana.
8265339	8266600	That's in a commercial now.
8267060	8270703	Alright, we are taking calls on our Skype line, www.orangeloungeradio.com.
8270743	8273985	Click on interact with us if you are interested in giving us a call.
8275506	8276807	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
8277948	8278709	Legend of Zaku.
8278989	8280590	Hello, Legend of Zaku, what's on your mind, buddy?
8281731	8284212	Well, I just got a few things I managed to find.
8284493	8288515	I don't know, I'm just trying to perpetuate the rumor cycle a little bit.
8288916	8289836	Oh, Christ, what's up?
8289856	8290557	I hope you have a link right now.
8291792	8294394	I'm posting up a link right now from a person's live journal.
8294414	8298437	Apparently, this is going to sound strange, but just bear with me.
8299318	8309066	It seems that this guy who's posting on his live journal basically, you know, heard some information a while back, and I mean like about maybe two or three years ago.
8310683	8313986	They were going to bring back a new DDR Arcade mix this year.
8314666	8323213	And the reason why he posted it is because a second person heard about this and it wasn't from the poster's source.
8325434	8325775	Sky?
8325915	8327316	Okay, yeah, no, no, I'm with you here.
8327716	8328837	I'm here, I'm with you.
8329057	8329858	I'm just listening to you.
8329878	8331059	Yeah, but I posted up the link.
8331299	8334021	Alright, I'm going to look at this link.
8334301	8335662	Yeah, that's pretty much it.
8335682	8336663	That's why he posted it.
8337907	8344891	Okay, so, they said years ago that this was supposed to be the year that DDR comes back, and let's see, I'm gonna, let's, da-da-da-da-da.
8346306	8347907	This comes from some guy's journal.
8347947	8349167	I've seen this guy around DDR3.
8349208	8350308	Cucumber is the name.
8350708	8352729	New DDR arcade makes its debut in September.
8352789	8354630	Rumor, rumor, rumor.
8355710	8363614	My first source said that an individual who has direct ties to Konami of Japan heard straight from them that DDR Extreme 2 will be previewed at Tokyo Game Show in September.
8364014	8369916	They've supposedly changed the hardware to make the game unbootlegable, although I doubt it took since December 2002 to do that.
8370336	8372797	My second source said there will be a location test in October.
8373818	8373898	Um...
8375518	8375858	I doubt it.
8376038	8376479	Whatever.
8376619	8380321	I mean, honestly, I've got to tell you, Zaku, it's another rumor to me.
8380721	8384823	It seems like every three months somebody's got the rumor they have a friend who knows Konami of Japan.
8386590	8390935	Yeah, but the fact that a second person found out would mean that, you know, two things.
8391275	8394619	A, that the rumor is probably, you know, spread to some other person.
8394699	8398303	Or B, there might be a second person who might have found a credible source.
8398383	8399344	So it could go either way.
8399585	8400946	Well, you're right.
8401266	8402788	Any of these rumors could go either way.
8402828	8406712	There's tons of things out there on the internet that are probably rumors now that will turn to fact later on.
8406753	8407073	You don't know.
8407633	8409514	I hope it's true.
8409914	8411554	I would love it if this news were true.
8411634	8412314	I hope it's true.
8412994	8419016	The unbootlegable part is kind of sad because that means we probably won't see the machines here, but something tells me we'll see them one way or another.
8419996	8420776	I hope it's true.
8420916	8422097	I don't know what else I can add to that.
8422197	8424257	There's no such thing as unbootlegable anything.
8424297	8424617	Yeah, I know.
8424797	8425538	Everything's pirateable.
8425578	8430959	But I hope it's true, and I don't know what else to say.
8431809	8433810	I mean, the signs are pretty clear right now.
8433930	8442915	Politary is saying some stuff about recording a new song, and this, you know, I don't know whether or not it's adding up to something, but it's out there.
8443375	8450219	It might not be true at first, but you know, it might be something that might be the basis for an official word.
8450299	8452460	It ever does come to that point.
8452600	8471188	I see how it also adds up together, you're right, the Politary and Naoki thing kind of going along with this makes everything kind of look add up, but also you have to realize, with three new games coming out in the US this year, three new DDR games and a Karaoke Revolution game, which, you know, it wouldn't surprise me if Naoki ever did something for that, you know, it's very possible that the Politary thing is for one of these games.
8471988	8473989	But still, I mean, we just have to look at the possibilities.
8474169	8474929	I hope you're right.
8475189	8475730	I hope you're right.
8475750	8476570	I hope this guy's right.
8478692	8505557	I hope I'm right, I mean, I just, you know, the only thing I'm, I don't know, maybe Konami might pull something out of their ass in E3 that might shock us all, that might shock us all and keep, and basically surprise the hell out of us, or, you know, maybe it might be when they drop the, when they release the new DDR games, I don't know, maybe some edit mode for some future arcade mix, now that they've already, you know, now that they have, you know, USB mode working, thank you Gran Turismo 4 for that.
8505657	8507357	You know what, it would, you know, it,
8509377	8512478	It wouldn't be an E3 if somebody doesn't drop a bombshell.
8512598	8516319	So I would love it for it to be to Konami, but who knows.
8516539	8521800	Konami may have had it all already blown already from GamePro, thank you.
8521880	8522580	So who knows.
8523100	8527321	Yeah, but they might have saved some of the stuff that hasn't seen light yet.
8527901	8533682	And basically everything's ready for them to do almost about anything beyond the home release.
8534478	8536220	as per saying a new arcade mix.
8536401	8538543	They already have a third-party distributor up.
8539464	8543649	It shouldn't be that hard to add USB slots to replace the memory card slots.
8543669	8543969	You know what?
8544049	8546933	I'm glad you brought... The Gran Turismo 4 is probably the first game to...
8547355	8556242	I'm glad you brought the USB thing up because I'll tell you what, one thing that is really getting me into In The Groove and the arcade is the USB support.
8556282	8557303	It is phenomenal.
8557343	8560285	I actually picked up a jump drive so I could check out what this does.
8560706	8564509	I'll tell you what, the In The Groove USB support damn near sells that game to me.
8564849	8566030	It is that good.
8566090	8568432	The USB support is phenomenal in that game.
8568652	8570876	Almost as good as the Stepmania USB stick.
8570936	8572218	Oh, oh, I'm sorry.
8572438	8573480	That's the same damn thing.
8573520	8574081	I don't care.
8574301	8575963	But this is something that's actually in the arcade.
8575984	8576504	You know what I mean?
8576564	8577105	It's different.
8577165	8578708	It's not... Shut up.
8579366	8604724	I wouldn't be surprised if Konami threw that in for their, you know, if they decided to continue to be on the arcades Konami should put mines in their game and show the in the groove folks how it feels Except they won't be mines, they'll be super bad stuff, or they'll be bombs or something, you know And stick it to the in the groove folks and let them know how it feels a little bit But don't take the hand plants idea, leave it in that other game
8606837	8611822	Konami has the ability to wipe them out for all they care, but they're just waiting.
8612082	8614044	They're waiting to see how In The Groove does.
8614585	8619049	And then they'll probably bring out their big guns just to hold on to their market.
8619209	8620971	That's my prediction right there.
8621932	8622893	They're playing the waiting game.
8623153	8624174	That's all they do.
8624354	8626316	It's going to be a very interesting E3.
8626396	8630981	I would love nothing more than for Konami and Red Octane to be right across from each other, but we know it won't happen.
8631261	8636404	Yes, as rivals, just holding fists like, like, like as if, you know, like a Mortal Kombat versus Green.
8636604	8637204	You know what, though?
8637645	8646209	Despite, despite anything negative I've said about in the groove in the past, competition benefits all of us in the long run.
8646810	8649051	So, I think that's it right there.
8649211	8650411	Competition will benefit us all.
8650431	8652052	Yeah, that basically spurs innovation.
8652433	8655234	Alright, I'm cutting, I'm, You have someone to go after.
8655834	8657255	Alright, I'm cutting you off now, Zaku.
8657555	8658136	Closing time.
8658436	8660017	You don't have to go home, but you can't stay here, buddy.
8660117	8660557	Alright, bye.
8662085	8662445	All right.
8663165	8665106	Nice quote of a song there.
8665126	8665606	You're right.
8665686	8666086	Thank you.
8666486	8667126	What, what, what, what?
8667306	8675468	I have a cousin who knows a guy who knows a girl who's dating a guy who knows somebody at Konami.
8675588	8676208	No, get this.
8676288	8677968	Okay, this is great.
8678128	8681089	The new arcade system, it's going to have this little thing in the background.
8681149	8683450	It's actually going to be like some sort of score telling thing.
8684330	8689971	If you do really good in it, you get contacted by aliens that actually take you up in their starship
8690751	8696535	to go serve other aliens a la, like, The Last Starfighter.
8698757	8699598	It's fucking awesome.
8699658	8701799	Konami is taking on the universe, man!
8701939	8702500	Loki, shut up.
8702520	8703120	We got another call.
8703621	8704621	You're on Orange Lounge Radio.
8707103	8708704	Hello?
8708965	8709265	Hi.
8710165	8712747	Did you have to talk to your mom there in the background or something?
8712807	8714589	It sounded like you were talking to somebody in the background.
8718271	8719112	Hi, someone else.
8719172	8719753	Alright, what's up?
8719793	8720253	What's on your mind?
8722243	8726484	Actually, the first question I have is about the Astro Printer pad.
8727204	8727484	Okay.
8727844	8741188	Now, I mean, originally I was going to get the bundle for Ending Groove with the Ignition pad, but now, I mean, I saw these screenshots that you guys showed, and you say it's probably, you know, like the best metal pad to get.
8741208	8742748	The Cobalt Flux, at least.
8743388	8745429	I haven't played Cobalt Flux, so I can't give an opinion on that.
8746029	8746889	And save up more money.
8754295	8756978	I have a Cobalt Flux and I just played on the Afterburner.
8757418	8760701	I would honestly rather save the $100 and just play on the Afterburner.
8760741	8763224	I actually prefer the Afterburner over the Cobalt Flux.
8763984	8774466	We also got to play on Ignition 3.0, which is basically the new Ignition, it's just now they've taken the arrows and they've de-DDR'd them, and they're just these generic orange arrows now, and it also has USB support.
8774706	8778667	The Ignition 3.0 honestly did nothing for me that Ignition 2.0 didn't already do.
8779007	8782208	So Ignition 3.0 is the exact same as all the other Ignitions they put out.
8782528	8789109	But After Burner, if you've got the money to drop, you really have to evaluate, how much will I use this thing?
8790208	8797792	And if you think you're going to use it a lot, it's something you're going to play every day or every other day, make a part of your exercise routine, yes, I say it's worth the money.
8797832	8805955	But if you honestly evaluate how much you play DDR, and see, for somebody like me, even though I talk a lot about DDR, how much do I actually go play it at home?
8806096	8807596	I don't actually play at home a whole lot.
8807936	8809117	I prefer to go to the arcades.
8809377	8812298	So for me, I don't see the point in getting a metal stage.
8812399	8815320	I would rather have the ignition pad because it's not worth it to me.
8815740	8821524	But if you don't get to play DDR in the arcades a lot or whatever, and you think you're going to play this a lot at home, I say go for it.
8822305	8822985	You won't regret it.
8824566	8829249	Yeah, yeah, I definitely don't get to play it as much in arcades, so that's what I'm thinking about.
8829269	8830150	Alright.
8830190	8832852	But then again, I'm thinking, how long does it last?
8834528	8835989	You know, that's a good question.
8836009	8841731	I don't know, I'm not Red Octane, but I know it took a lot of abuse in the group night.
8841791	8847294	People were playing with shoes on and heels and everything and playing the crazy songs and it seemed to hold up.
8847374	8849695	Yeah, the arrows are not acrylic.
8849735	8853877	I'm pretty sure there's some form of plexiglass, so they're not going to smash if you step on them 20 times.
8855137	8864350	So I just, I don't know though, but you have to look, I've had ignition pads that die after six to nine months, so I'm hoping it's not the same thing with the afterburner, especially considering that kind of investment.
8864671	8868036	But unfortunately, until these things hit the market, we won't know how long they really last.
8868236	8869598	So nobody can really say.
8870019	8871581	You're taking a little bit of a gamble.
8872021	8887780	I would say if Red Octane has some reasonable type, and I'm not familiar with Red Octane directly, I've always bought their products in stores when I've bought their products, but if they have some type of warranty replacement program as long as it's reasonable, I say go for it, because you don't know how long these things are going to last.
8889662	8890483	Yeah, yeah, right.
8890603	8891943	I'll probably get it then, thanks.
8892223	8892784	Alright, no problem.
8892804	8893404	Anything else for us?
8894925	8896146	Um, probably.
8896186	8900848	I mean, I have a lot of opinions now in the group since I actually finally got to play it last week.
8901068	8901789	Alright, what do you think?
8901809	8904831	So, I mean, it's pretty interesting.
8905151	8914116	Like, I don't like how it's such a... It's not as varied as DDR is with the music, which is probably my biggest problem.
8914356	8914496	Mm-hmm.
8916047	8917528	But otherwise, it looks pretty good.
8917568	8919889	I mean, the difficulty is really hard, but whatever.
8921150	8925452	I'm willing to dish out money for the home version anyway, just for something new to play.
8925852	8928914	Yeah, I mean, it's going to be, what, $30, I think?
8929054	8930575	Don't quote me on that.
8930595	8930975	$40 at most.
8931955	8932856	And you get a t-shirt.
8934797	8935337	Whatever.
8935497	8937538	A keychain.
8937658	8943941	People that are dedicated to these games enough to be tuning into this show are probably not going to regret the purchase, honestly.
8944482	8945102	Just go for it.
8946437	8947418	Yeah, definitely.
8947738	8950720	Alright, well I'm going to let you go so we can take some more calls, but thanks for calling in, alright?
8951761	8956064	There will be a day where I will review in the group someday.
8956985	8958766	Alright, let's take one more call here.
8959907	8961288	Hi, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.
8962389	8962949	Hey guys.
8963450	8964691	Hello, is this Angel?
8965551	8965852	Yep.
8966032	8966752	What's on your mind?
8966972	8967973	You're not here tonight!
8969214	8969754	I know.
8969855	8970315	What's going on?
8971542	8972503	Sicker than crap.
8973904	8974564	Sorry to hear it.
8974924	8977846	Well, I know that you feel better, first off.
8977886	8978627	Rest up and feel better.
8979247	8979768	What did you think?
8979788	8989094	Because you had to go to the In The Groove party because I had to beg somebody to go with me because Jamie had to... Matt had to work and Jamie had the school thing, so I was begging LiveJournal and you took it up.
8989494	8990275	So you had to go.
8990435	8990875	What did you think?
8992456	8993677	I thought it was awesome.
8994057	8997600	It's going to give me something to do while I'm waiting for...
8999469	9002251	Extreme 2 and Ultramix 3.
9003291	9004572	It's just going to be a filler.
9005492	9007753	I like both games differently.
9007813	9009214	I like DDR for DDR.
9009234	9011195	I like in the group for in the group.
9011275	9021501	So I'm not going to sit there and knock it because I'm still getting exercise and I'm still liking the music that either game offers.
9023021	9024782	I think that's a very fair way to look at it.
9024822	9025303	You know what?
9025343	9025603	It's just...
9026883	9028784	Bitch and cry and moan all you want.
9028864	9035346	Both these games are out there and they're going to be available, so why not eat them up and just enjoy what both games have to offer.
9036647	9046151	And I'm glad that you guys liked the Afterburner because I wanted to try it, but I was just not wearing the right shoes that day, so I was just like, eh, I don't want to kill myself.
9047591	9051733	So I might actually end up buying that with the games.
9051913	9054274	Yeah, it's going to be interesting.
9054294	9054974	Oh, and you forgot...
9055902	9057062	Yeah, yeah, Angel?
9058983	9064804	You forgot the little spoof about you and the bar when Pirate was trying to play.
9064824	9067625	That was pretty funny when we all raided the press room.
9067665	9068925	Oh, God, that's right.
9068985	9069805	Okay, remember this?
9069945	9078947	Okay, because they took the stool away from Toadie, what I ended up doing when we were in the media room is you decided you were going to play some insane song.
9079307	9083691	So I was like, here, hold on to my hand, and you can use my hand as the bar, and he did it.
9083911	9084351	It worked.
9084611	9086052	This is how people are going to have to do it at home.
9086092	9091417	He held on to my hand, not in a homosexual way, but he held on to my hand as the bar, and he played, and it actually worked.
9091737	9096401	Well, the guys, whoever was dancing next to you, I didn't know him, but you... I think his name was Andre.
9096421	9097161	He's from Oregon.
9097421	9101404	Okay, well, he did the same thing, and I actually snapped a picture of it.
9101424	9101805	Yeah, I saw that one.
9101845	9105728	Somebody commented on the website about that, like, dude, is somebody using a hand as the bar?
9105768	9108170	Yes, because we... And I would like to say that was my idea.
9108190	9108270	Yeah.
9108690	9109150	Copyright.
9109210	9110431	That was my idea.
9110972	9111412	Patent pending.
9111432	9112052	That was great.
9113133	9113333	Yay.
9113733	9114073	All right.
9114794	9117756	Anyway, hide a pirate and hide everyone there.
9117996	9119217	I'm sorry I'm not there, but hey.
9119417	9120558	Yeah, feel better.
9120618	9123299	I take it we're not meeting at CCL on Tuesday.
9124420	9126041	Actually, I... I will be there.
9126281	9127062	I think we are.
9127142	9128362	Talk to your girlfriend.
9128502	9128943	Okay.
9129083	9129343	All right.
9129423	9129783	Will do.
9130163	9130404	All right.
9130444	9131104	Have a good one, Angel.
9131244	9131744	Thanks for calling.
9131965	9132205	All right.
9132285	9132705	Bye, guys.
9132725	9133145	Bye.
9133285	9133726	Have a good one.
9136007	9136887	Yeah, it was arm raping.
9136927	9137528	It was pretty hot.
9137668	9138188	It was hot.
9138468	9139528	One other thing I've got to say.
9139688	9142829	I noticed, because sometimes I look at people chatting on different forums.
9143210	9151132	How many different places did you say, Rob took three pictures of my ass and put them on the Horizons Radio Gallery for you all to see?
9151852	9153993	I think I put it on two different places.
9154013	9155594	It was on my LiveJournal and then...
9157035	9159297	I know I commented on the Orange Lounge site.
9159317	9160017	That might have been it.
9160057	9164400	It just seemed like everywhere I was reading you said something about, God, Rob takes all these pictures of my ass.
9165000	9166822	Well, I mean, it is a nice ass.
9167362	9168343	It doesn't even exist.
9168383	9169964	I don't even have one at my body weight.
9170524	9171004	You know what?
9171024	9175067	I was just trying to get pictures of ham plants because I was actually going to do something with no ham plants.
9175087	9175627	I don't believe you.
9175647	9175988	You're right.
9176028	9176828	It was all about your ass.
9176888	9177188	All right.
9178049	9179010	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
9179050	9179690	Personal on Skyline.
9182830	9183651	Greetings from New York.
9183731	9184651	It's the one and only Ranma.
9184691	9185392	How are you guys doing?
9185572	9185832	Good.
9185872	9186513	How are you, Ranma?
9186533	9186993	What's on your mind?
9189855	9190175	Pretty good.
9190495	9194298	I want to give you my quick Anime Boston review wrap-up in like 14 minutes.
9194818	9197680	Make it really, really, really quick because you're actually breaking up a little bit.
9197720	9200102	Your voice is breaking there, so make it quick.
9203226	9204487	Crap, I'm gonna make it really quick.
9204547	9205908	Anime Boss was great.
9206008	9207269	I'm gonna play DD on Forever.
9207490	9209211	The Tokyo Game Action guys say hi.
9209571	9211893	And, um, the masquerade kind of sucked.
9211933	9216016	It seems if you made your own costume, but you wore shoes, you automatically disqualified.
9216877	9217177	What?
9217237	9217878	You wore shoes?
9217898	9219039	You got the... What the hell?
9221241	9221501	Whatever.
9222852	9224412	Well, you know what?
9224432	9227973	We need to get out to some anime cons and get our name out there some more.
9228273	9229233	I need to go or something.
9229273	9230214	We need to get a little room.
9230614	9231734	I want to travel to the East Coast.
9231994	9233934	Some East Coast person fly us out there.
9233974	9236215	We'll do a table thing or whatever.
9236255	9236775	It'll be fun.
9236955	9242616	Dude, if y'all fly out to the East Coast, y'all can stay in my room for free.
9242956	9244637	You promise not to take advantage of us, right?
9245677	9246057	Never.
9246277	9246577	All right.
9246917	9247397	Sounds good.
9247417	9249158	We've got to get an opportunity to cosplay.
9250518	9250738	Yeah.
9251277	9252159	Thank you for the offer.
9252199	9252861	We appreciate it.
9254044	9256750	Anyway, buddy, because you're kind of breaking up, I'm going to let you go.
9256830	9257672	But have a good one, okay?
9258975	9259296	You too.
9259396	9260058	Alright, bye.

9557978	9558860	Thanks for watching!
9616056	9616937	Thanks for watching!
9647113	9655725	Hiho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter V, the letter A, and the number 59.
9661135	9674343	We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, and now it's time for that part of the show where we get a little bit angsty, and we do the FUs of the week, which, by the way, we have new background music for tonight, all of us.
9674543	9675224	Yay!
9675324	9676624	I already missed my old one.
9676684	9678005	If you were getting sick of those songs.
9678185	9680787	Well, you know, I could start it off with your old one and then get into the new one.
9680987	9681687	That's okay.
9681747	9682928	I do kind of like the way it started.
9683188	9685130	This one starts off and changes.
9685230	9685790	All right, we'll do that.
9686350	9690652	Um, okay, so, why is it we do the FUs of the week every single week, DarkSakura?
9690972	9691732	Eh, fuck it.
9707139	9713682	My FU goes toward, um, this Tittle Insurance Company, it's spelled T-I-T-T-L-E.
9714420	9721044	And when I first looked, I was like, well, no, I was thinking maybe it's title, and they misspelled it, but no.
9722885	9734612	Anyway, this, and actually, I transferred from person to person, then to another claims company, then to another claims company here in Sacramento, and it's just been stupid.
9734652	9737673	He calls me and says, well, call me back, blah, blah, blah.
9737693	9740255	So I leave him two fucking messages, and he never calls me back, the bastard.
9741596	9741796	So...
9742847	9745968	I'm gonna have to wait again to find out when I get my damn money to fix my damn car.
9747048	9751469	Um, my fiance was supposed to hammer my, uh, fender back into place so that I could at least drive it.
9752990	9753830	No, it rained.
9754350	9754850	Sorry!
9756171	9759832	Um... You know, I just really miss having a car.
9760372	9764173	I-I feel like... Like my left arm's been cut off.
9764273	9767434	You know, you can function without a left arm, but it fucking sucks.
9768154	9768875	And that's how I feel.
9770175	9770255	Um...
9772977	9781983	Uh, apart from that, um, you know, fuck the people who have no sense of adventure and don't like anything new.
9782583	9784424	Because you don't fucking give it a chance!
9786365	9786985	Okay, I'm done.
9788106	9789887	And now we move on to Loki.
9793269	9793890	Anyways...
9796704	9797564	I love this song.
9800826	9805668	First FU goes to Epson and their wonderful printers and ink.
9806368	9814191	Did you know, and this is an unknown fact here, did you know it's actually cheaper to buy a new printer than to buy cartridges for said printer?
9815396	9816277	That's pretty sad.
9817357	9822640	And what's great, though, is they actually have their cartridges.
9822780	9826822	It literally would have cost me like 60 bucks to actually buy a cartridge.
9826842	9829063	You know, cartridges for this stupid printer.
9829423	9831484	And the printers have, the cartridges have timed...
9832765	9837888	This, like, programming is basically timed, so after a certain amount of time, whether you're using it or not, it'll say it's empty.
9838449	9839429	Thank you, Epson!
9839750	9841651	Appreciate your wonderful product there.
9842171	9843192	Well, guess what, folks?
9843792	9845133	I ain't gonna play by that.
9845453	9853779	So, um, I bought new, cheaper cartridges, and I bought a- and I also got a program for free that locks in the value so that it will just work until it's done.
9856580	9860503	Also, fuck you too, stupid people driving your cars, cause-
9860984	9865986	For some reason, you just don't understand what that stupid little flashy light is that's on the corner of your cars.
9866026	9866306	Guess what?
9866326	9867147	It's a turn signal.
9868047	9871048	People use it to signal when they're changing lanes.
9871909	9873449	Maybe you should learn how to do that.
9873609	9873970	Thank you.
9876072	9882475	Fuck you to Ridley Scott for wasting two and a half hours of my life with a crappy movie called Kingdom of Heaven.
9883075	9886937	Should have known that it was going to suck when the word heaven was in the title.
9887257	9888457	But you know what?
9888698	9889158	Guess what?
9889318	9890078	The movie sucked.
9890118	9896081	It's basically if you took all the battles from Lord of the Rings and made them anticlimactic, that would be the movie.
9897061	9897521	Enjoy.
9898282	9898762	It sucked.
9899881	9906283	And then, finally, um, fuck you to, um, the really crappy party you had in Final Fantasy XI.
9906423	9913764	I've been, like, not playing for, like, a while now, and I finally got back into playing, and the first thing I get is a party that lasts for two battles, and then it's over.
9915765	9918225	Fucking sucked ass.
9919326	9924347	And then, um... Finally, um...
9926787	9930849	Fuck you to Fox for having Family Guy at 8 o'clock because I want to watch it and I'm going to miss it.
9931169	9932430	Fuck you to people who don't have a TiVo.
9933490	9934311	Actually, wait, that would be me.
9934411	9934891	You know what?
9934931	9937492	Some of us aren't reliant on television for our sense of entertainment.
9937652	9938713	Yeah, and I don't need TiVo.
9938813	9939513	I have BitTorrent.
9940934	9941214	I'm done.
9942315	9942875	Alright, my turn.
9947695	9966558	I would like to give an F you to a general like just being tired and exhaustedness this weekend because I've been doing stuff like the past couple weeks in a row so I just you know I finally just kind of hit I was like I hit the point where I'm like I don't want to do anything at all ever except stay at home and lie in bed all day
9967229	9983460	so that's kind of the weekend I have so F you to laziness F you to the fact that we were a little bit disorganized in making E3 plans so we're kind of stuck in a not so great hotel but that's alright because at least we're going so I'm very happy about that by the way I am going for sure absolutely by the way I forgot to tell you thanks I found out so
9984243	9987024	and maybe this time the hooker will see Brad again.
9987184	9987964	Yeah, that would be great.
9988965	9990645	So, let's see.
9990765	9991245	Is that about it?
9991725	9998548	And F you to the fact that I have not one, not two, but three classes to teach next week and one of them is on a Saturday.
9998968	10000148	F you to working on Saturdays.
10000168	10001268	That's a horrible, horrible fate.
10002369	10006050	That anybody who works a Monday through Friday age five job should not have to do is working Saturday.
10006838	10007559	Amen to that!
10007599	10008379	I did that last week.
10008519	10009840	So, FU to Saturday working.
10010100	10013002	But then, I get the whole next week off, so I guess I can't bitch too much.
10013302	10013803	What can I say?
10015384	10019847	Alright, let's go over to Toadie and find out Toadie's FUs for tonight.
10020507	10022969	First one, from the Wednesday night.
10023169	10029873	Fuck pretty much the entire city of San Francisco for having like a transportation system that doesn't make any fucking sense.
10030674	10036518	Why do I have to drive like ten blocks down streets that don't make me make a left-hand turn?
10037148	10065827	Just to get to a parking garage that charges me $11 For like, oh, three hours and five minutes Kiss my ass, I wanted those two dollars back Anyway, uh, and then the other one I have is, uh Fuck California's statutory rape laws Going back to the Myspace thing earlier I wish I just lived, you know, a hundred miles away in Nevada Sixteen years old and you're done with it This is bullshit over here, I'm sorry I'm good Alright, that's it, I, no, no
10066144	10074357	Fuck you to Sega for having Super Monkey Ball Deluxe be such a crappy game.
10074598	10074878	The end.
10076821	10078304	Let's get to the chatroom, shall we?
10079268	10097241	Angel says F you to being so sick that I hardly have energy to do much of anything F you to the rain on Wednesday while Sky and I were in the city oh yes because we weren't prepared don't okay that's all I forgot we got rained on on Wednesday that sucked Illusion says F you to people that are complaining about oops I did it again being an EX2 it's all about oops three snaps
10098499	10102863	FU to Family Guy for distracting me from the show and probably keeping me from even hearing the FUs.
10102923	10103143	Hey!
10103584	10104144	Get a VCR.
10104785	10106266	FU to anyone that doesn't see Crash.
10106306	10106986	It was amazing.
10107046	10108768	It's got to have a Best Picture nomination locked.
10108848	10111911	Okay, that's not really an FU, but more of me whoring Crash out.
10112972	10116815	Jin4576 says, FU to Finals Week and work sucking.
10117495	10121399	Ranma says, FU to the DDR fanboys and girls that are beefing about In The Groove.
10121719	10122380	It's just a game.
10122420	10122860	Relax.
10122920	10125602	Just because you suck at In The Groove, that don't give you the right to bitch.
10125803	10126143	Bring it.
10126693	10128875	It's already been broughten, sir or ma'am.
10129415	10131457	MPQ says, A big F you to children.
10131937	10132678	I hate children.
10132718	10137301	My sister has to take care of this doll thing for a school project and it drives me insane.
10137721	10138142	I hate it.
10138502	10140784	If it didn't cost $500, I would have broken it already.
10140864	10142525	I absolutely despise children.
10145487	10154494	AUKY says, My F yous of the week are, I didn't get to go to the launch party and then I ended up getting sick anyway.
10155315	10155555	Dope.
10157443	10161866	Alex L. Dubes says, my FU goes to my parents for leaving to Melbourne without me.
10162326	10165068	Because of them, I didn't get to play on the in-the-groove machine they have there.
10165168	10167490	I think it's the only one they have in Florida.
10170391	10174534	RPG King says, FU to only seeing my girlfriend once a week for the past month.
10174574	10176595	Hopefully that will change as we get closer to the summer.
10177316	10180378	Also, FU to bar huggers at our local DDR tourney.
10180658	10182099	They need to be weaned off the bar.
10182319	10182639	Toady?
10183080	10183560	Shut up.
10186257	10211885	the official bar whore of Orange Lounge Radio SSJ100 Matt to my cell phone about to break FU super glue is holding it together right now and I can't afford a new phone and my warranty is shot duct tape is the universal solution to the Red Sox and FU father and son team who heckled me in the parking lot for wearing a Yankee jersey screw them go Yanks FU to time for not going fast enough because I can't wait to go back home to New York on Friday
10213959	10239731	Legend of Zaku says F you to the murder of a discreet math final I have to take tomorrow morning F you to nearly killing my old ignition pad when repairing it only to make the fixed arrows a lot more stiffer at least I still have my uber elite BNS ignition pad and F you to moving back home and having to put up with dial up again meaning I won't be listening to your show or be on Skype for that matter until I either get back on campus in the fall or get broadband this and he got cut off but I'm assuming it's summer
10241554	10243656	Dark Tetsuya says F you to Sure West.
10243696	10247839	Our phone line has been in and out of commission the past few days, thus limiting my internet.
10249080	10252742	And lastly, Dark Knight says my F you is to depression, end of line.
10253142	10255084	Oh, and F you to being broke and not having a car.
10258546	10258947	The end.
10259127	10260188	You guys are so angsty.
10263110	10263510	I'm proud.
10263690	10264891	We must talk about something.
10265296	10266256	Okay, what, Loki, what's up?
10266596	10271938	Well, we didn't talk about Red Octane's... We didn't, I was just about to get to it, if you'd hold on.
10272738	10275159	Well, I don't know where you're going, there's no set plan.
10276019	10278699	Yeah, you're right, that's the wonderful thing about this show, is that there's no set plan.
10279200	10280740	Orange Lounge Radio, no set plan.
10282900	10285621	Orange Lounge Radio and the Bush presidency.
10286001	10286681	Eh, we don't have a plan.
10291341	10311506	Guitar Hero is the new game that Red Octane announced this week but this is interesting because we're not sure to what extent they actually meant to announce this because they actually ended up taking down their website for it so they're kind of trying to pretend it didn't exist I think it's one of those cases where it was an E3 surprise it was supposed to be a surprise at E3 and surprise!
10311586	10317628	Somebody leaked your website out so now the whole internet knows about it so, oh well
10318415	10321979	Red Octane is going to be doing Guitar Hero for PlayStation 2 in the fall of this year.
10323460	10338213	It's interesting, by the way, to note that Red Octane for a long time, and I don't know if they still are, but at least I know previously when the Guitar Freaks games were big on PlayStation 2, they were doing five-button guitar controllers that were for use with the Guitar Freaks.
10339315	10342036	So it's very interesting that they're doing this.
10342096	10344557	Is this a game to try and promote sales of those controllers?
10344857	10346297	Or will it be a whole new controller?
10346337	10347177	We don't know just yet.
10347517	10351299	But I do know a lot of people have bitched about the fact that there have been no new Guitar Freak games.
10351759	10354219	And not to say that this game is going to be a Guitar Freak's clone.
10354279	10356120	We don't know, but we can kind of...
10356720	10363504	Basing my judgment only on their website and just how it looked, they put a lot of detail on that website.
10364084	10367066	And if that same amount of detail is in the game, it should be really good.
10367286	10368147	Well, here's what's interesting.
10368187	10374070	For those of you guys that are assuming that because Red Octane's putting it out means it's going to be like in the groove, you'd be wrong.
10374390	10377572	Because Harmonix is actually the folks that's developing me into this game.
10377872	10385457	Harmonix did, I almost said in the groove, a frequency and amplitude and they helped with Karaoke Revolution and
10386377	10387238	And what else did they do?
10387258	10388998	And there's another big one I'm not thinking of.
10389298	10394880	But Harmonix, you know, they've put out... Frequency and Apple II especially were games that kind of were underrated.
10395340	10397421	So it'll be very interesting to see what they come up with for this.
10397661	10405444	Plus, they must have their own studio or something, because they get these great original stuff, and then Karaoke Revolution had a lot of stuff as well.
10405604	10407964	They redid cover songs, but it was all pretty good.
10408425	10409205	So it should be interesting.
10409805	10417750	Now, they had a website at GuitarHeroGame.com, but it got taken down as soon as the website, you know, DDR Freak put out a press release on this, too.
10417810	10424375	And I believe it was either Games Are Fun or somebody had said it first.
10425335	10427957	I think it was Games Are Fun originally put the story out there.
10428798	10428978	So...
10430089	10431150	Everybody got a hold of this.
10431750	10432991	But this is the other interesting thing.
10433031	10435653	Now, this goes back to way in the beginning of the show.
10435713	10438796	You were talking about some guy was giving you their card and talking about Red Octane.
10439136	10447342	They also have a site called BAGuitarHero.com, which also got taken down, but they're actually having a contest to get bands in the game.
10447822	10448743	Uh-huh.
10448943	10454467	So maybe the guy you were talking to was one of these folks trying to get their music in the new Guitar Hero game.
10454748	10456309	I still think he was macking on me.
10456629	10457610	Maybe, but you never know.
10457790	10458090	Okay.
10458230	10458490	All right.
10460536	10461917	What is this game going to include?
10461977	10470642	Well, the site indicated before it got taken down that it would have songs made famous by Jimi Hendrix, Red Hot Chili Peppers, and White Zombie.
10470943	10475546	Of course, when they say the term made famous by, you can pick up that it's going to be covers.
10476126	10479348	But, you know, Karaoke Revolution, the covers weren't.
10479926	10480927	I don't know, man.
10480967	10481788	White Zombie's pretty awesome.
10481848	10483029	I hope they have this game playable there.
10497438	10497999	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10515270	10519012	Kenchia Hall, by the way, for those that are unfamiliar with E3, they basically have two huge halls.
10519032	10521434	What is it, West Hall and Main Hall?
10521494	10521774	I don't know.
10521814	10522554	Main Hall, West.
10522714	10523235	Main Hall, West Hall.
10523435	10527778	Main Hall is where Xbox was last year and all the other big developers.
10528998	10531440	Places like Electronic Arts.
10533801	10534742	Who else is in there?
10535162	10535843	Engage.
10536043	10537444	Engage.
10537464	10538024	Konami.
10538485	10539185	And the U.S.
10539305	10539546	Army.
10539726	10541327	Yeah, all those folks were in the Bain Hall.
10541907	10547051	The West Hall is another huge hall, and that's where Nintendo and Sony were last year, and where presumably these guys are going to be again.
10547832	10555017	And then some other, like, you know, not quite as big, but pretty big stuff, like 1up.com, I think, was in there, and Tech TV, when they were still around, had a booth in there.
10555057	10560281	And some of the folks that put out the plug your joystick into the TV thing, they were all in there.
10560301	10562263	Sega and Acclaim into little side rooms.
10562443	10567287	And then there's little side rooms, and that's where Sega, Acclaim, Atari, where they all were, like rooms along the way.
10567848	10572292	And then you have this place called Kensha Hall, and if you don't know where it is, you'll miss it.
10572732	10574013	It's underneath the main hall.
10574053	10575575	You go downstairs, and there's this other place.
10575895	10577677	And that's where they kind of stuck all the Korean games.
10578736	10580116	There was like Korean Alley.
10580256	10583317	And peripherals and stuff, and that's where some of the cool stuff was.
10583377	10591740	Yeah, what's interesting about Kenshiya Hall is that even though people joke about it and say it's a place where games go to die, it's one of the more interesting places at E3, it's really your hidden gems area.
10592440	10597741	That's where Classic Gaming Expo is doing a little preview, that's where the X-Tango game was, whatever happened to that?
10598121	10600222	O2 Jam, all that stuff was down there.
10602628	10604591	So it'll be interesting to see what Kensha Hall has this year.
10605291	10606633	Maybe Red Octane.
10606793	10611860	The competing company, the guy that I talked to from some other company and I don't remember who it was.
10611880	10613502	Yeah, whatever happened with the speakers.
10613842	10617867	Yeah, and then there was the guy who said they would send us the speakers to review on the show and we didn't get any.
10618508	10618768	Oh well.
10619910	10620130	Bummer.
10621249	10625093	Alright, so of course now that you guys have been asking in chat, will Orange Lounge be going again?
10625133	10625353	Yes.
10625673	10627855	Will we be taking pictures and putting them on the website?
10627915	10628476	Hell yes.
10628516	10629837	We're going to take tons and tons of pictures.
10630077	10632139	I am getting pictures with Booth Babes this time.
10632379	10632960	Son of a bitch.
10633060	10634801	I am not being the one holding the camera.
10635242	10635682	No, no, no.
10636142	10637383	I have to get the Booth Babe pictures.
10637404	10637864	It's not fair.

10746151	10746332	What?
10746452	10746672	What?
10746712	10746852	What?
10747012	10747232	What?
10747272	10747412	What?
10747512	10747712	What?
10747732	10747872	What?

10752422	10763850	I have a MySpace account.
10778228	10785836	and only one person is, well, two people have friended me, one person being you and one person being some chick.
10785876	10786597	Wait, what is this, 1UP?
10787273	10788254	No, Myspace.
10788334	10788774	Oh, Myspace.
10788894	10789254	Oh, okay.
10789575	10794938	You know, if I had known I made ones, you should... My Myspace name is LokiOLR.
10794999	10796460	Did you put your picture on there?
10797560	10797881	No.
10797901	10798601	See, that's why.
10798781	10801983	Put a picture of you looking metrosexual and you'll have women from everywhere.
10802544	10804265	I don't have any metrosexual pictures.
10805286	10806206	We can fix that.
10807407	10811170	We'll get you a little button-up shirt and paint your nails or something.
10812071	10814272	Yeah, just wear what Andrew's wearing.
10816434	10816734	All right.
10818346	10819287	Okay, whatever.
10819968	10825072	Anyway, look, if you want to be popular, you've got to be metrosexual, because, you know, homos sell.
10825152	10825853	That's what it is.
10830857	10832058	And I am homo, so I can say that.
10832318	10832698	It's okay.
10833940	10836822	Okay, definitely, when we're making gay jokes, you know this show's over.
10836902	10839064	So please put the nail in the coffin of this show.
10839104	10841806	Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
10841846	10843768	We'll start it off with Toadie, your final thought.
10845333	10847554	What exactly is this my final thought on?
10847714	10849154	Just, you know, whatever you want.
10849314	10850615	It's like Jerry Springer.
10850635	10852475	At the end of every show, he would give you his final thoughts.
10852555	10853215	What's your final thought?
10853355	10857297	Okay, I'm eagerly anticipating the ITG home version.
10858317	10863819	I hope that Konami doesn't fuck up the new Extreme 2 like they fucked up the other one.
10864239	10866900	I'm pretty sure that's already been covered on previous shows.
10868860	10872301	And... Yeah, I think that's it.
10873422	10873802	I'm good.
10874162	10874542	All right.
10875263	10876203	Loki, your final thought.
10878644	10880304	Work, work, work.
10880924	10883945	I'm hoping to play more Final Fantasy XI this week.
10884125	10885965	God damn it, I need to get back in my routine.
10886525	10889166	It's just, you know, the woman wants attention.
10889746	10890706	You know how that is.
10891146	10893046	And, I don't know.
10893126	10898527	It's just like, I had to play last night from like, you know, 10 to 2 a.m.
10898607	10899608	And I started getting tired.
10899628	10901988	You know what else is really awesome?
10902575	10903376	Golden Grahams.
10903756	10909039	And I bet you guys didn't know this, but if you pour enough water into a toilet, it will eventually flush itself.
10911301	10911801	Now you know.
10911821	10913622	That's pretty fucking cool.
10913642	10915103	And you know what my final thought is?
10915163	10916324	You know what else is pretty cool?
10916724	10917644	It's Golden Girls.
10918805	10919386	Cheesecake.
10920046	10921287	DarkSakura.
10921507	10922087	Oh, yeah.

10922988	10923408	That's hot.
10923808	10924789	DarkSakura, your final thought.
10926163	10933608	Uh... I'm going to be doing some gaming this week before going to E3, just because I have to get back into the gamer mindset.
10934008	10938611	Last night, Dan and I, on our main machine, beat Metal Slug X. That game is fucking hard.
10939551	10940072	I gotta play that.
10940952	10942553	Metal Slug X was pretty damn awesome, though.
10942573	10943974	We got turned into zombies the whole game.
10944014	10944454	It was great.
10945375	10947356	Um... And... Well, mummies, really.
10948677	10952539	Um... And then, uh... I plan on doing some PSO tomorrow.
