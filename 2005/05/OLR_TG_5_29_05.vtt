00:00.169 --> 00:02.831
[SPEAKER_00]: Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, week of May 30th, 2005.

00:02.931 --> 00:14.101
[SPEAKER_02]: You're tuned in to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your podcast home for all the latest video game news and gamer chat.

00:14.341 --> 00:17.824
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.

00:19.673 --> 00:24.476
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, once again, everybody, and a happy Memorial Day week to you guys.

00:25.196 --> 00:27.017
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you had fun with your three-day weekend.

00:27.417 --> 00:30.739
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you guys downloading this on Monday, maybe you're still enjoying that three-day weekend.

00:31.279 --> 00:35.582
[SPEAKER_00]: Let us not forget the veterans that gave us this day and fought for our country.

00:35.962 --> 00:38.563
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't forget the masses of the retail.

00:40.464 --> 00:42.565
[SPEAKER_03]: Those who have to work on Memorial Day.

00:42.625 --> 00:43.646
[SPEAKER_00]: That too, that too.

00:44.206 --> 00:48.909
[SPEAKER_00]: The voice you hear back there is my lovely co-host, Jamie Summers, Dark Sakura.

00:49.383 --> 00:50.164
[SPEAKER_03]: Yo, yo, yo.

01:11.420 --> 01:15.341
[SPEAKER_00]: No Skype in here, because Skype cuts out too much for us, so we can't do the Skype thing.

01:15.381 --> 01:17.422
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we're not like, you know, from yesterday.

01:17.482 --> 01:18.863
[SPEAKER_03]: We were freshly purchased today.

01:20.063 --> 01:20.743
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thank you.

01:21.103 --> 01:21.703
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thank you.

01:21.804 --> 01:31.487
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting off the show tonight, before we get into any games whatsoever, big, big thank you to iPotter.org and the one and only Adam Curry for, I guess, noticing us this week.

01:31.507 --> 01:31.987
[SPEAKER_03]: Best hair.

01:32.589 --> 01:32.829
[SPEAKER_03]: Ever.

01:33.150 --> 01:33.850
[SPEAKER_00]: I agreed.

01:34.631 --> 01:36.692
[SPEAKER_00]: When I think of the 80s, I will always think of that hair.

01:37.053 --> 01:42.917
[SPEAKER_00]: But seriously, we got noticed on iPodder.org this week, which is really weird because we didn't submit anything over there.

01:42.977 --> 01:46.780
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know if one of our fans did it or what, but we just showed up on there suddenly.

01:46.840 --> 01:54.026
[SPEAKER_00]: And usually I'm pretty good about submitting our show to like, you know, Podcast Alley, Podcast Pickle, Podcast This, Podcast That, whatever shows up.

01:54.046 --> 01:55.507
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a Podcast Pickle?

01:55.527 --> 01:56.447
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, believe it or not.

01:56.768 --> 01:56.888
[SPEAKER_00]: It's...

01:57.646 --> 01:58.687
[SPEAKER_00]: They got podcast everything.

01:58.747 --> 01:59.287
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the new thing.

01:59.387 --> 02:08.393
[SPEAKER_03]: They should do like from Jay and Silent Bob, podcastpoopshoot.com Somebody is probably registering it as we speak.

02:08.773 --> 02:16.558
[SPEAKER_00]: But regardless, for whatever reason, we never got submitted to iPodder.org until this week, and it was huge for our traffic.

02:16.638 --> 02:18.339
[SPEAKER_00]: So welcome to all our new subscribers.

02:18.799 --> 02:21.161
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a quick FYI, what we are, what we do.

02:21.881 --> 02:24.463
[SPEAKER_00]: Orange Lounge Radio, we've been around for like three years.

02:24.483 --> 02:26.284
[SPEAKER_00]: We've only been podcasting since January.

02:27.265 --> 02:42.744
[SPEAKER_00]: Internet radio station that runs live 24 hours a day, 7 days a week Dedicated to rhythm and music gaming But this is part of our expansion into other video games We want to talk about other games and other gamings And video games that don't suck And news that you guys really want to know about So that's what we're all about

02:43.144 --> 03:05.796
[SPEAKER_00]: and we just want to produce for you guys like a 30-40 minute show something long enough for you guys to listen to while you're commuting just to keep you up on all the news and all that stuff so and sometimes we like to argue and bicker back and forth and we do sometimes we do some things shut up we do bitch we do some things that are outside of games sometimes as well like Dark Sakura's advice column which we'll get to a little later exactly but first off

03:06.216 --> 03:06.877
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

03:21.338 --> 03:21.678
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up?

03:21.718 --> 03:22.539
[SPEAKER_00]: How was your gaming week?

03:24.180 --> 03:27.663
[SPEAKER_03]: I played PSO Blueburst for like four hours yesterday.

03:28.404 --> 03:30.625
[SPEAKER_03]: I quit Final Fantasy XI yesterday.

03:30.726 --> 03:33.027
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I quit Final Fantasy XI finally as well.

03:33.288 --> 03:37.731
[SPEAKER_03]: And the clouds parted and the angels came down and sang and it was pretty groovy.

03:39.232 --> 03:41.294
[SPEAKER_03]: And I played some Silent Hill 3.

03:41.714 --> 03:42.715
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm close to the end.

03:43.413 --> 03:45.475
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm in the hospital right now.

03:45.915 --> 03:46.496
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, very cool.

03:46.956 --> 03:47.396
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what, though?

03:47.437 --> 03:49.839
[SPEAKER_00]: You know you're addicted to MMOs, though, seriously.

03:50.199 --> 03:53.442
[SPEAKER_00]: When you quit Final Fantasy XI and then freaking sign up for Guild Wars.

03:53.562 --> 03:55.864
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, did I really accomplish anything?

03:56.224 --> 03:58.926
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you really accomplish anything going from Final Fantasy XI to Blue Burst?

03:59.067 --> 04:06.233
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but with Blue Burst, it's windowed and I can do other crap while my little femoral is... femoral is...

04:07.926 --> 04:12.850
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't really see it as necessarily leaving one game for another.

04:12.970 --> 04:17.232
[SPEAKER_00]: I just kind of see it as, I'm bored with this toy and I want a new toy now.

04:17.833 --> 04:22.316
[SPEAKER_03]: I've always gone back to PSO, but when Ragnarok 2 comes out, oh, you better watch.

04:22.336 --> 04:24.177
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, what is this, the fourth time on PSO?

04:24.197 --> 04:28.520
[SPEAKER_00]: You got Dreamcast, GameCube, Xbox, now PC.

04:29.501 --> 04:34.604
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but the Dreamcast one pissed me off because it wouldn't work with the broadband converter they had.

04:35.482 --> 04:42.084
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't own a Dreamcast until years later when they were like $50 and I only bought it so I could emulate Nintendo games on it.

04:42.345 --> 04:47.506
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I discovered that Soul Calibur is really cool and I kind of went back and rediscovered all these Dreamcast games.

04:47.927 --> 04:51.228
[SPEAKER_03]: Soul Calibur is all about playing that game with the damn fishing rod.

04:52.088 --> 04:53.749
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the fishing rod is analog.

04:54.869 --> 04:56.930
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you sling it, it hits buttons.

04:57.370 --> 04:58.710
[SPEAKER_03]: The triggers inside are buttons.

04:59.171 --> 05:01.832
[SPEAKER_03]: So Rod Calibur is the most fun ever.

05:02.292 --> 05:02.512
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.

05:03.459 --> 05:03.900
[SPEAKER_00]: Step on the Cat

05:24.116 --> 05:24.797
[SPEAKER_00]: She likes it.

05:24.817 --> 05:25.658
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that a Flash game?

05:26.018 --> 05:26.659
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no.

05:26.879 --> 05:28.321
[SPEAKER_03]: It's when Shermie is on the floor.

05:28.341 --> 05:30.343
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that going to be an Xbox 360 launch title?

05:30.423 --> 05:31.244
[SPEAKER_03]: And you step on her.

05:31.424 --> 05:32.165
[SPEAKER_03]: Not very hard.

05:32.625 --> 05:37.891
[SPEAKER_03]: And she just flattens herself like this big ball of cat fat and looks up and goes, meow.

05:38.672 --> 05:39.393
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, you can go.

05:39.793 --> 05:39.973
[SPEAKER_03]: Meow.

05:40.053 --> 05:40.754
[SPEAKER_03]: And she scatters off.

05:42.227 --> 05:44.129
[SPEAKER_03]: Step on the Cat, her favorite thing.

05:44.809 --> 05:46.190
[SPEAKER_01]: Loki, what games have you been playing?

05:48.011 --> 05:52.214
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I've played Final Fantasy XI because you old people suck.

05:52.494 --> 05:53.695
[SPEAKER_01]: Addict, addict.

05:53.895 --> 05:56.657
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, well at least I'm not leaving for another MMO, okay?

05:57.017 --> 05:58.558
[SPEAKER_01]: At least he's low.

05:58.578 --> 06:00.639
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if that's better or worse, but anyways.

06:01.059 --> 06:06.223
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I have my character who's level 58 now, finally, and I bought new armor.

06:06.977 --> 06:08.178
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll play FFXI for food

06:35.492 --> 06:38.535
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh no no, we'll give head for Final Fantasy, I don't know.

06:38.775 --> 06:40.417
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, let it finish.

06:40.878 --> 06:41.598
[SPEAKER_01]: We got news to get to.

06:41.779 --> 06:47.084
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, so I play Final Fantasy, I play a little bit of my cell phone game, Worms.

06:47.104 --> 06:48.285
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you remember that game, Worms?

06:48.646 --> 06:50.988
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it doesn't really transition well over to the cell phone.

06:51.008 --> 06:52.830
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of games don't, FYI.

06:52.950 --> 06:58.156
[SPEAKER_01]: For some reason, they just get pissed off that I'm kicking their ass, and they just...

06:58.766 --> 06:59.787
[SPEAKER_01]: They just commit suicide.

06:59.827 --> 07:02.768
[SPEAKER_01]: They just walk right off the screen into the water and die.

07:02.788 --> 07:05.830
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, what the hell kind of AI is that?

07:05.890 --> 07:11.093
[SPEAKER_00]: Seriously, mobile games now is all about the retro factor.

07:12.113 --> 07:13.794
[SPEAKER_00]: Or it's like Bejeweled on your phone.

07:14.655 --> 07:16.736
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, whoa, $5 for this piece of crap.

07:16.756 --> 07:17.376
[SPEAKER_01]: Yay.

07:17.576 --> 07:18.717
[SPEAKER_01]: Bejeweled came on my phone.

07:18.737 --> 07:22.819
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so I played that, and that's pretty much it.

07:22.859 --> 07:24.840
[SPEAKER_01]: Really haven't played much as far as games this week.

07:25.373 --> 07:25.633
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

07:26.814 --> 07:33.080
[SPEAKER_00]: Myself, I actually picked up a copy of Fable because Fable was running on sale, $30.

07:33.801 --> 07:36.963
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was one of those Xbox games where everybody was like, dude, if you have an Xbox, you have to have Fable.

07:37.163 --> 07:37.664
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to have it.

07:37.984 --> 07:39.666
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's like the one RPG.

07:40.737 --> 07:42.979
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if you hang around in the town too long they chase you off

08:07.043 --> 08:12.792
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on if you're good or bad, but you can completely play the game as a good guy or you can completely play as a bad guy.

08:13.192 --> 08:16.617
[SPEAKER_00]: So you kind of forge your own path, which is kind of neat.

08:17.458 --> 08:21.965
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can have the people refer to you as Arseface because you get to choose your own title later on.

08:22.705 --> 08:26.007
[SPEAKER_01]: And your character changes in appearance depending on whether you're good or bad.

08:26.107 --> 08:29.769
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you have your arm cut off, they call you stubby or something.

08:29.969 --> 08:31.370
[SPEAKER_00]: Graphics, pretty nice.

08:31.570 --> 08:35.012
[SPEAKER_00]: But the only problem I noticed with Fable is that sometimes it's a little bit skippy.

08:35.592 --> 08:37.093
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of like has some loading skips.

08:37.593 --> 08:40.975
[SPEAKER_00]: Awful long loading times in between areas though for such small areas.

08:41.575 --> 08:46.318
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of nitpicking a little bit though because honestly, the cutscene graphics are really great.

08:47.218 --> 08:50.620
[SPEAKER_00]: I really am impressed with the graphics mostly, but just the little skips were a little bit annoying.

08:50.640 --> 08:52.702
[SPEAKER_00]: The sound is awesome, the sound in the game.

08:53.082 --> 08:59.045
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got its own original score, I think, that was done by Danny Elfman, at least one of the songs, but the rest of the music really fits into that.

08:59.405 --> 09:03.168
[SPEAKER_00]: The only problem I had with the sound, though, is that sometimes it was overbearing.

09:04.248 --> 09:10.412
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, for instance, this one scene, I'm trying to get trained on magic, and I can't even hear the guy talking because all I can hear is the waterfall behind me.

09:10.973 --> 09:14.294
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the sound kind of gets annoying sometimes, but the score is really great.

09:14.354 --> 09:16.534
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, they could release the score as a CD and probably sell it.

09:17.254 --> 09:18.995
[SPEAKER_00]: But overall, I think the game's kind of fun.

09:19.295 --> 09:20.875
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a lot of fun stuff going for it.

09:21.535 --> 09:27.017
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd probably give it, like, I don't know, like, I'd give it an above-average score, like a 3 out of 5 stars.

09:28.157 --> 09:28.937
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure yet, though.

09:28.957 --> 09:30.477
[SPEAKER_00]: I still gotta really play a little more with it.

09:30.497 --> 09:33.298
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm only, like, two hours into it, so the verdict's still out, but I'm having fun with it.

09:33.538 --> 09:34.698
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I did get a new game.

09:35.019 --> 09:35.399
[SPEAKER_00]: What'd you get?

09:35.719 --> 09:36.859
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Dan bought me Technic Beat.

09:37.559 --> 09:38.039
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, what'd you think?

09:38.259 --> 09:39.020
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't played it yet.

09:40.200 --> 09:42.081
[SPEAKER_03]: I watched you play and I'm like, oh, Technic Beat.

09:42.521 --> 09:43.601
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell us about it next week then.

09:44.482 --> 09:46.242
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still sitting on my desk.

09:46.703 --> 09:52.045
[SPEAKER_01]: For those just tuning in, I give Smart Bomb a 1 out of 5 because it sucks ass.

09:52.185 --> 09:52.805
[SPEAKER_00]: And why is that?

09:53.125 --> 10:00.908
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, first off, the game has such long loading times and the puzzles are fucking hard and it makes you want to actually throw your PSP.

10:01.348 --> 10:01.648
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura.com

10:18.570 --> 10:18.890
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura

10:36.358 --> 10:37.740
[SPEAKER_01]: and X-Button, I believe.

10:38.400 --> 10:40.642
[SPEAKER_01]: And you play it basically vertically.

10:41.063 --> 10:48.730
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's also another game called Star Soldier, which is going to be coming out, which is also played that way, just like the old school vertical shooter games.

10:48.850 --> 10:50.291
[SPEAKER_03]: That was Star Soldier.

10:50.331 --> 10:52.373
[SPEAKER_03]: Wasn't that a Sega CD game?

10:52.914 --> 10:53.294
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

10:53.314 --> 10:53.935
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no idea.

10:53.955 --> 10:53.995
[SPEAKER_00]: No...

10:55.891 --> 10:56.652
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a game.

10:56.692 --> 10:58.753
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, no, I'm thinking TurboGrafxDuo.

10:58.773 --> 11:00.114
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a game called Star Soldier.

11:00.134 --> 11:01.575
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, maybe this is it.

11:03.056 --> 11:04.957
[SPEAKER_00]: Hudson did a lot of games for TurboGrafx, didn't they?

11:05.177 --> 11:23.010
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, and they did a parody version called Star Parodia, which you could play as Twinby, or you could play as Bomberman, because Hudson also did Bomberman, or you could play as a flying PC engine.

11:23.757 --> 11:26.719
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think the idea of the PSP on its side is cute.

11:26.879 --> 11:27.339
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why.

11:27.999 --> 11:29.060
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's not innovative.

11:29.160 --> 11:31.021
[SPEAKER_03]: Bandai already did that with the WonderSwan.

11:31.401 --> 11:34.743
[SPEAKER_00]: But how many people in America played the WonderSwan?

11:35.063 --> 11:35.824
[SPEAKER_00]: You and who else?

11:36.923 --> 11:37.483
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for watching!

11:54.508 --> 11:57.570
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not a new idea, but it's something a lot of people haven't seen.

11:57.930 --> 11:58.190
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

11:58.330 --> 11:58.630
[SPEAKER_00]: Granted.

11:59.130 --> 11:59.391
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright.

12:00.031 --> 12:02.352
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, let's move on to some actual gaming news.

12:03.292 --> 12:15.219
[SPEAKER_00]: Following up from E3, you guys remember when we went to the Final Fantasy concert, that guy who was emceeing, he's a voice actor in the game, and he said that he would be at E3 that Wednesday, because he was the voice of Tidus in the game.

12:15.799 --> 12:19.281
[SPEAKER_00]: I never saw him there, but of course I wasn't hanging out at the Square Enix booth the whole time.

12:19.761 --> 12:21.882
[SPEAKER_00]: But I remember whispering to Loker, I said, I

12:22.062 --> 12:24.844
[SPEAKER_00]: I might have missed it, but again, the E3 is so packed and crowded, I don't know.

12:49.179 --> 12:57.242
[SPEAKER_00]: The Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists are trying to negotiate a new agreement with game publishers regarding voice acting.

12:57.622 --> 13:03.844
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically what it comes down to is that right now voice actors are paid a one-time fee up front for their services.

13:04.656 --> 13:05.856
[SPEAKER_00]: But no, no, no.

13:05.916 --> 13:10.258
[SPEAKER_00]: Voice actors want some type of payment based on the successes of the game.

13:10.318 --> 13:11.378
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, residuals.

13:11.698 --> 13:14.039
[SPEAKER_00]: If the game sells so many copies, we want a cut of it.

13:14.059 --> 13:14.699
[SPEAKER_03]: They want royalties.

13:14.959 --> 13:15.600
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, basically.

13:16.080 --> 13:17.320
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do you think?

13:17.600 --> 13:18.441
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that sound fair?

13:18.461 --> 13:19.141
[SPEAKER_03]: They're entitled.

13:19.901 --> 13:25.003
[SPEAKER_03]: It's their talent being lent to the, you know, it happens to regular stage actors.

13:26.187 --> 13:32.374
[SPEAKER_03]: They still make money off, you know, like, I was watching some special about Greece, and they still get a regular check.

13:33.175 --> 13:33.415
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

13:33.776 --> 13:35.698
[SPEAKER_03]: For any money that the movie still makes.

13:36.793 --> 13:39.014
[SPEAKER_03]: It's only like a dollar or so, but they still get it.

13:39.134 --> 13:40.155
[SPEAKER_00]: Still something.

13:40.175 --> 13:42.456
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that the same should apply to the voice actors.

13:42.896 --> 13:55.721
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what about the flip side of this, where a lot of folks say, and I tend to think about this a little bit too, whereas you have the voice actors in movie-based games, where the game just isn't the same without the original voice actor.

13:55.761 --> 13:57.762
[SPEAKER_00]: Take, for instance, I don't know, Buffy in the Buffy game.

13:58.183 --> 13:59.463
[SPEAKER_00]: She wasn't in it.

13:59.623 --> 14:01.104
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't Sarah Michelle Gellar, right?

14:01.204 --> 14:02.464
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, but everybody else was there.

14:02.544 --> 14:03.245
[SPEAKER_00]: Did that kind of...

14:03.965 --> 14:06.887
[SPEAKER_00]: Did that one voice not being right kind of detract from the game?

14:07.067 --> 14:07.528
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

14:07.848 --> 14:08.509
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe, I don't know.

14:08.549 --> 14:09.790
[SPEAKER_00]: She sounded just like her.

14:10.190 --> 14:11.491
[SPEAKER_00]: Then let me think of a better example.

14:11.551 --> 14:14.913
[SPEAKER_00]: Say you were trying to replace Marlon Brando in the upcoming Godfather game.

14:15.034 --> 14:16.275
[SPEAKER_00]: That just wouldn't be the same, right?

14:16.295 --> 14:17.195
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, maybe.

14:17.235 --> 14:18.096
[SPEAKER_01]: It's debatable.

14:18.116 --> 14:18.636
[SPEAKER_01]: Not necessarily.

14:18.756 --> 14:24.681
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's an example, kind of an old example, but Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis, it was not Harrison Ford doing Indiana Jones voice, still fair.

14:24.821 --> 14:25.381
[SPEAKER_01]: Felt fine to me.

14:47.691 --> 14:50.313
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, is that an option?

14:50.373 --> 14:52.135
[SPEAKER_00]: Can they really break the union thing?

14:52.175 --> 14:59.321
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they going to set themselves up for a real... I think what it comes down to is they need to actually be negotiating their contract a little bit better.

15:00.142 --> 15:00.982
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what it comes down to.

15:01.223 --> 15:03.665
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to get paid by royalties, don't take the job then.

15:03.745 --> 15:05.706
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, then let me kind of rephrase my question this way.

15:05.806 --> 15:07.948
[SPEAKER_00]: How important is voice acting in a game to you?

15:08.529 --> 15:12.212
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty important since a lot of the games are reliant on that to go along with the visual.

15:13.704 --> 15:14.565
[SPEAKER_03]: Night Trap 3 points out of 100

15:37.708 --> 15:39.788
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how much I care about it.

15:40.108 --> 15:40.869
[SPEAKER_01]: It really doesn't matter.

15:41.069 --> 15:42.829
[SPEAKER_03]: Good voice acting, to me, can make or break a game.

15:43.049 --> 15:47.630
[SPEAKER_00]: I think voice acting can make a good game better, but I don't think it can save a game.

15:47.990 --> 15:50.011
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, a crappy game is still a crappy game.

15:50.071 --> 15:55.012
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have the guy who does all the movie trailers, who has the sexiest voice in the world.

15:55.032 --> 15:55.992
[SPEAKER_03]: Or Mr. Movie Phone.

15:56.672 --> 15:57.472
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the Movie Phone guy.

15:57.512 --> 15:59.673
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have either of them in the game, and if the game sucks, the game sucks.

16:00.613 --> 16:06.374
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, though, especially, though, for games that are ported over from Japanese games where they redid all the voices...

16:07.455 --> 16:08.256
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

16:36.153 --> 16:37.694
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do we have to fight all the time, guys?

16:38.174 --> 16:39.155
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't we all just get along?

16:39.695 --> 16:40.196
[SPEAKER_00]: How about a hug?

16:40.376 --> 16:41.276
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, Rob, that doesn't work.

16:41.516 --> 16:42.037
[SPEAKER_00]: How about a hug?

16:42.477 --> 16:45.919
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't the voice actors in the gaming publishing companies just hug?

16:49.001 --> 16:50.502
[SPEAKER_00]: Xbox 360's on the way.

16:50.522 --> 16:53.503
[SPEAKER_00]: $300 is the rumored price point.

16:54.124 --> 16:57.786
[SPEAKER_00]: I always thought 360 would probably be what they'd charge for it.

16:57.826 --> 17:00.047
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, ha ha ha, get it, Xbox 360, 360.

17:00.728 --> 17:02.529
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're still saying that that's a possibility.

17:03.297 --> 17:06.998
[SPEAKER_00]: But the $300 is kind of the target price point for the new system.

17:07.399 --> 17:10.280
[SPEAKER_00]: So based on what you saw at E3, is this worth $300?

17:10.340 --> 17:10.620
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck yes.

17:10.640 --> 17:11.840
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?

17:13.141 --> 17:14.021
[SPEAKER_03]: It was brilliant.

17:14.361 --> 17:14.681
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?

17:14.941 --> 17:15.141
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

17:15.441 --> 17:17.342
[SPEAKER_01]: I paid $300 for my PlayStation 2.

17:18.142 --> 17:18.603
[SPEAKER_01]: Might as well.

17:19.043 --> 17:20.643
[SPEAKER_03]: I paid $400 for my JPS 2.

17:20.823 --> 17:22.704
[SPEAKER_00]: Allow me to be the first to say no.

17:23.004 --> 17:24.325
[SPEAKER_00]: I will wait for the first price cut.

17:24.585 --> 17:30.267
[SPEAKER_00]: I am more... I'm not really sold on any of the launch titles yet.

17:31.107 --> 17:36.051
[SPEAKER_00]: My opinion could change, but there is nothing on the Xbox that's making me go, I have to have this system when it launches.

17:36.451 --> 17:37.532
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I want the system?

17:37.652 --> 17:38.773
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, eventually.

17:38.813 --> 17:39.254
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait, wait, wait.

17:40.134 --> 17:41.415
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's what's selling it for me.

17:41.636 --> 17:41.936
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

17:42.136 --> 17:42.336
[SPEAKER_01]: What?

17:42.496 --> 17:43.477
[SPEAKER_01]: DOA Volleyball 2.

17:45.258 --> 17:47.680
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's not announced, but it's coming.

17:48.941 --> 17:49.542
[SPEAKER_01]: It will be good.

17:49.702 --> 17:51.003
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking forward to DOA 4.

17:52.104 --> 17:53.465
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm actually looking forward to Quake 4.

17:53.985 --> 17:54.586
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks pretty cool.

17:55.967 --> 17:57.548
[SPEAKER_00]: Half-Life 2 is on it.

17:57.668 --> 17:58.989
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm honestly more excited about PS3.

17:59.915 --> 18:00.215
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now.

18:00.416 --> 18:02.358
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I feel like I want to save my money and get a PS3.

18:02.438 --> 18:03.920
[SPEAKER_03]: I did also go to the PS3 demo.

18:03.940 --> 18:06.323
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know I'm going to have them both, so it doesn't matter.

18:06.423 --> 18:15.393
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, when it gets down to about the Xbox 360 time, we'll already have the game room at my work and we'll have a 360 there, so I really don't need to buy one.

18:15.513 --> 18:17.256
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's what I'll bet they'll do.

18:17.476 --> 18:18.998
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll bet you anything this is what happens.

18:19.318 --> 18:20.019
[SPEAKER_00]: Although I could be wrong.

18:21.343 --> 18:22.843
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll sell the system for like $300.

18:23.344 --> 18:25.004
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll do like a bare bones thing for $300.

18:25.564 --> 18:38.028
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you buy the 360, they'll do some kind of cheap little time where it's like, you know, the 360 pack or something that'll go for $360 and it comes with a game and like Xbox Live for so many months or something, you know, additional.

18:38.048 --> 18:40.008
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll come with a game.

18:40.048 --> 18:41.409
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll come with another controller.

18:41.449 --> 18:42.029
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll come with...

18:42.509 --> 18:44.791
[SPEAKER_01]: Brand new game skins!

18:45.011 --> 18:45.831
[SPEAKER_01]: Woo!

18:45.851 --> 18:47.252
[SPEAKER_01]: That new power button thing.

18:47.312 --> 18:53.137
[SPEAKER_03]: I do think that they are being smart with how they're combating the PS3 release because they're going to be doing Halo 3.

18:54.117 --> 18:54.938
[SPEAKER_03]: That is smart.

18:55.238 --> 18:56.259
[SPEAKER_03]: That is very smart.

18:56.399 --> 18:59.401
[SPEAKER_00]: It is, but I think the hardcore gamers are not going to be affected.

18:59.441 --> 19:01.462
[SPEAKER_03]: I did stay in line, though, for both demos.

19:03.104 --> 19:04.605
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have to say, though, that...

19:05.569 --> 19:13.454
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the Xbox 360, I'm really looking forward to a lot, because not only is it a system, but it's also a multimedia docking station.

19:13.574 --> 19:16.116
[SPEAKER_03]: And they even showed a picture of a PSP hooking up to it.

19:16.756 --> 19:19.618
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything, basically, that's USB firewire is going to hook up to it.

19:19.778 --> 19:20.299
[SPEAKER_03]: And that...

19:21.119 --> 19:26.664
[SPEAKER_03]: All it's going to be is just, oh look, I can download my MP3s that I bought on Xbox Live to my PC.

19:44.522 --> 19:52.262
[SPEAKER_00]: My MP3 player, which I think you're right where it's going to an entertainment system, not just gaming.

19:53.431 --> 20:01.537
[SPEAKER_03]: They're also showing this one about designing your own shirts on there, having them shipped out as a t-shirt and you can sell them through the Xbox system.

20:01.557 --> 20:02.237
[SPEAKER_03]: They had it on there.

20:02.477 --> 20:09.122
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they going to be crappy like a certain nameless site which does a lot of shirt printing for people and then the shirts wash out after they're washed?

20:09.222 --> 20:09.602
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

20:09.662 --> 20:10.683
[SPEAKER_03]: It didn't say anything about that.

20:10.863 --> 20:19.368
[SPEAKER_03]: It was saying though that you can market your art, you can show your designs, you can share, you can create a community real-time chat.

20:19.649 --> 20:22.490
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, you know, last time I checked I thought that's what the internet was for.

20:23.771 --> 20:28.835
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do I have to pay $300 for this console that I can do on the internet for free?

20:29.735 --> 20:31.256
[SPEAKER_01]: No, sorry, I'm not going to do that.

20:31.676 --> 20:32.397
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't give a crap.

20:32.557 --> 20:34.678
[SPEAKER_01]: A gaming console is a gaming console is a gaming console.

20:34.718 --> 20:36.640
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a multimedia device.

20:36.880 --> 20:38.981
[SPEAKER_01]: If I wanted a multimedia device, I'd buy a media PC.

20:39.081 --> 20:41.122
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh wait, no, I'm not going to touch that either because they're expensive.

20:41.143 --> 20:42.463
[SPEAKER_03]: How about a big whatever to all of that?

20:42.864 --> 20:45.445
[SPEAKER_03]: A system is only good as the games that are on it.

20:46.186 --> 20:46.646
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.

20:46.746 --> 20:52.630
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, though, I was more impressed with the PS3 demo and I really don't want to be a hoarder Sony, but

20:53.234 --> 20:53.394
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

20:53.414 --> 20:53.994
[SPEAKER_03]: The controller.

21:20.322 --> 21:22.982
[SPEAKER_01]: The controller is going to be mappable.

21:23.022 --> 21:25.783
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, it's a custom controller.

21:25.823 --> 21:28.644
[SPEAKER_01]: Every game that you play is going to be a brand new controller.

21:29.724 --> 21:30.164
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see.

21:30.584 --> 21:37.345
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that it's going to be like that... What was that Atari thing where you hooked it to your head and then you blink and it makes a move left?

21:37.465 --> 21:39.265
[SPEAKER_00]: That's retarded.

21:39.325 --> 21:42.046
[SPEAKER_00]: Please don't.

21:42.146 --> 21:43.526
[SPEAKER_00]: Duke Nukem forever.

21:44.946 --> 21:46.467
[SPEAKER_00]: Forever before it comes out.

21:47.207 --> 21:47.307
[SPEAKER_00]: Um...

21:48.240 --> 21:54.346
[SPEAKER_00]: The message boards on Duke Nukem Forever's website, located... I don't even know where it is.

21:54.366 --> 21:55.227
[SPEAKER_00]: 3D Realms' site.

21:55.487 --> 21:58.751
[SPEAKER_00]: On their message board, they're teasing it.

21:58.771 --> 22:08.981
[SPEAKER_00]: 15 enemies supposed to be showing up in there, and they're saying, they're swearing, a ton is done, we have hundreds of props that you can place in the world, and the artists just continue to pump stuff out.

22:10.495 --> 22:12.697
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, they're saying they're going to show it at next year's E3.

22:12.717 --> 22:15.861
[SPEAKER_00]: I have two words for that.

22:15.961 --> 22:17.082
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

22:17.582 --> 22:19.224
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see the goods, people.

22:19.384 --> 22:20.165
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see the goods.

22:21.467 --> 22:23.649
[SPEAKER_00]: But it makes me sad we haven't had a Duke Nukem.

22:23.669 --> 22:25.311
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, just like the Phantom.

22:25.351 --> 22:26.191
[SPEAKER_01]: Where'd the Phantom go?

22:26.211 --> 22:26.652
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's right.

22:26.832 --> 22:27.713
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not there.

22:27.753 --> 22:28.274
[SPEAKER_00]: In the trash.

22:28.394 --> 22:28.674
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright.

22:28.934 --> 22:30.876
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but the Gizmondo's still hanging about.

22:32.738 --> 22:33.139
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright.

22:33.760 --> 22:36.861
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get to the advice column.

22:36.901 --> 22:42.944
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, if we sat here and we talked about games all day long, we'd have no time to go out and go to golf clubs.

22:43.464 --> 22:48.366
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to fill your heads with useless...

22:50.875 --> 22:56.320
[SPEAKER_03]: Today's advice is how to survive in Whitewater Rapids after falling out of your raft.

22:56.340 --> 22:57.361
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one.

23:17.580 --> 23:21.843
[SPEAKER_03]: If you were thrown from the raft, lie on your back, face up with your feet facing downstream.

23:23.604 --> 23:21.843
2.

23:24.344 --> 23:27.066
[SPEAKER_03]: If your raft is still accessible, swim for it and hold on.

23:27.346 --> 23:30.909
[SPEAKER_03]: Even if it is upside down, it can still provide protection from rocks and other obstacles.

23:32.790 --> 23:30.909
3.

23:33.270 --> 23:35.131
[SPEAKER_03]: Be aware of the current and of river conditions.

23:35.552 --> 23:39.374
[SPEAKER_03]: If you get to a calm area between rapids, vigorously swim for the shore.

23:40.715 --> 23:39.374
4.

23:41.175 --> 23:46.879
[SPEAKER_03]: Be prepared for a hole in the river where water recirculates, creating a whirlpool that can pull you under.

23:47.739 --> 23:52.602
[SPEAKER_03]: If you are caught in a hole, plunge your feet down as far as you can and actively swim to the bottom.

23:52.942 --> 23:55.323
[SPEAKER_03]: You will soon be pulled from the hole by the current.

23:55.783 --> 23:57.124
[SPEAKER_03]: But my final piece of advice?

23:57.364 --> 23:57.584
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes?

23:58.765 --> 24:00.646
[SPEAKER_03]: Just don't go whitewater rafting.

24:01.967 --> 24:04.148
[SPEAKER_03]: Go, like, hiking or something.

24:04.468 --> 24:05.809
[SPEAKER_03]: At least the bears are kinder.

24:08.270 --> 24:08.910
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for that.

24:09.531 --> 24:12.232
[SPEAKER_00]: Useful, very useful piece of information.

24:12.372 --> 24:13.673
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody on the internet can use.

24:13.893 --> 24:15.834
[SPEAKER_01]: The bears are more afraid of you than they are of them.

24:16.154 --> 24:17.215
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so throw sticks at them.

24:19.042 --> 24:21.404
[SPEAKER_00]: Loki, you were playing the Matrix Online for what, like a week?

24:22.624 --> 24:22.865
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.

24:23.045 --> 24:26.127
[SPEAKER_00]: You were a big fan of the Matrix movies, even the second and third ones, right?

24:26.867 --> 24:28.368
[SPEAKER_01]: I still watch them.

24:28.668 --> 24:36.694
[SPEAKER_01]: I would have liked the second movie to have been what I read as the preview script, but apparently they punked it down.

24:37.274 --> 24:40.016
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you feel about this in the Matrix Online this week?

24:40.276 --> 24:41.397
[SPEAKER_00]: They offed Morpheus!

24:41.994 --> 24:43.835
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's too early to be doing this, to be honest.

24:43.875 --> 24:59.948
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, I mean, granted, the game, everyone loved the fact that the main characters were in it and stuff, and I thought that they could drag it a little longer, but just giving the basic description of what happened, you know, apparently it looks like, I guess, Morpheus... I got it.

25:00.148 --> 25:00.608
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you got it?

25:00.628 --> 25:00.868
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

25:00.968 --> 25:07.333
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, anyways, Morpheus is basically, one of the plotlines, or storylines through this, is he's searching for Neo's body.

25:07.373 --> 25:08.114
[SPEAKER_01]: He's trying to get...

25:08.294 --> 25:10.576
[SPEAKER_01]: Neo back, because I think he thinks he's alive or something like that.

25:10.616 --> 25:25.466
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, so he's trying to recover Neo's body from the machines, but when the machines refuse to return Neo's remains, Morpheus began rampaging through Mega City, which is the city that this all takes place in, deadening code bombs strong enough to threaten the Matrix itself.

25:25.846 --> 25:29.509
[SPEAKER_01]: The machines responded by sending an assassin after Morpheus.

25:29.549 --> 25:31.350
[SPEAKER_01]: The assassin succeeded and Morpheus was killed.

25:32.667 --> 25:43.892
[SPEAKER_01]: and basically now there's a new story arc, I guess, where players in the game are now have the opportunity to investigate the circumstances of Morpheus' death and participate in the new Matrix saga.

25:43.972 --> 25:46.794
[SPEAKER_01]: So now they're trying to figure out who the assassin is, I guess.

25:46.894 --> 25:47.314
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess.

25:47.634 --> 25:49.575
[SPEAKER_01]: And really there's like three sides to this.

25:49.815 --> 25:50.856
[SPEAKER_01]: You have like, you have the...

25:51.736 --> 25:52.657
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a weird buzzing.

25:52.677 --> 25:53.257
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry about that, guys.

25:53.677 --> 26:02.982
[SPEAKER_01]: You have the Zionist groups or whatever, and then you've got the, I guess, the Machines, and then some other... And the One-Armed Man.

26:03.542 --> 26:04.242
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the One-Armed Man.

26:04.822 --> 26:12.806
[SPEAKER_01]: But basically, what it comes down to is at any time during this whole thing, they could just say, oh, we're going to resurrect him, and he's back.

26:12.886 --> 26:14.547
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, whatever.

26:14.667 --> 26:16.328
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a little really do that, just

26:18.703 --> 26:19.703
[SPEAKER_00]: It was his sister.

26:19.863 --> 26:24.466
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always their sister that kills them.

26:24.586 --> 26:29.128
[SPEAKER_01]: I won Matrix Online right there.

26:30.108 --> 26:30.729
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, guess what?

26:30.749 --> 26:33.210
[SPEAKER_01]: They've killed off all of them already, so who's left?

26:34.814 --> 26:35.415
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't tell you.

26:36.596 --> 26:37.216
[SPEAKER_00]: Jada Pinkett?

26:39.238 --> 26:39.398
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

26:41.380 --> 26:41.741
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

26:43.442 --> 26:45.304
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about this article.

26:45.504 --> 26:46.785
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this one's kind of interesting.

26:47.386 --> 26:58.856
[SPEAKER_00]: I was looking at Slashdot earlier this week, and they actually linked to somebody's blog, and this is on a site called corpnews.com, and somebody's just talking about E3, and I'm just going to kind of just

26:59.056 --> 27:00.257
[SPEAKER_00]: E3 is no longer useful as a trade show

27:21.096 --> 27:45.477
[SPEAKER_00]: The folks that work at the Best Buy, the EB Games, the CompUSA That it's become more about these booth babes and showing things off And that it's not very professional And the only place that you can find the professionalism Is to go to the upstairs area where it's nice and quiet And they're basically saying that a lot of the game companies have gotten a little more And I'm sorry, I'm paraphrasing If you want to read the complete story, go to the website Um

27:47.101 --> 27:50.123
[SPEAKER_00]: They're basically saying that a lot of the companies are getting very stingy.

27:50.423 --> 27:56.527
[SPEAKER_00]: Quote, companies like Vivendi and EA will ask for a name right off the bat before admitting you to their corporate Shangri-La.

27:56.827 --> 28:07.994
[SPEAKER_00]: Blizzard was running World of Warcraft media demos on the noisy show floor, and Nintendo did not even have enough press kits for all media, saying, we only give those out to major media outlets.

28:08.294 --> 28:08.814
[SPEAKER_03]: I got one.

28:09.234 --> 28:12.276
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and I'm thinking DarkSakra got one somehow.

28:12.476 --> 28:13.557
[SPEAKER_01]: Major media outlets.

28:13.697 --> 28:15.278
[SPEAKER_03]: Then again, I did get mine on Wednesday.

28:16.372 --> 28:16.853
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, maybe.

28:16.873 --> 28:20.557
[SPEAKER_00]: We're a major media outlet, right?

28:20.577 --> 28:27.464
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the thing is that once we get our paperwork back, we're going to be up there.

28:28.325 --> 28:29.186
[SPEAKER_03]: We can only get bigger.

28:30.227 --> 28:33.630
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's good that they're willing to give us growing people.

28:33.650 --> 28:35.312
[SPEAKER_01]: Granted, folks, we cover the news.

28:35.552 --> 28:37.915
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the gaming news better than, say, you know,

28:38.519 --> 28:39.319
[SPEAKER_01]: Fox News

28:53.786 --> 28:54.887
[SPEAKER_03]: To get them excited.

28:55.447 --> 28:57.629
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically word of mouth advertising is what they're trying to do.

28:58.370 --> 29:02.333
[SPEAKER_03]: And then for the ones who are true media, they're saving the real juicy bits.

29:02.853 --> 29:09.618
[SPEAKER_03]: Like when I got to play Popocoros or seeing the new Front Mission, that was pretty cool.

29:10.579 --> 29:13.560
[SPEAKER_03]: or the Call of Cthulhu demo that they were showing.

29:15.220 --> 29:21.361
[SPEAKER_03]: There's also where you talk to their reps, find out, hey, this is what's going on.

29:21.461 --> 29:22.201
[SPEAKER_03]: These are our dates.

29:22.261 --> 29:23.182
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what it's going to do.

29:23.402 --> 29:25.102
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what our business is looking like.

29:25.522 --> 29:35.664
[SPEAKER_03]: I do agree that you're going to, that's why they have those press rooms so that you can go up and get figures, get the business side of things, get dates, things like that.

29:36.164 --> 29:39.165
[SPEAKER_03]: See the stuff that they're not going to put out on the main floor.

29:39.745 --> 29:43.307
[SPEAKER_03]: I really do think that the main floor is a method of advertising.

29:44.547 --> 29:46.348
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's not always the way it used to be.

29:46.608 --> 29:48.849
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think about it, it's really ballooned in the past few years.

29:48.869 --> 29:54.771
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's what this guy's kind of trying to say because he's saying he's been for like the past six years and just he's kind of watched this whole thing evolve.

29:54.811 --> 29:57.992
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I think the core thing is, is that E3's really evolved.

29:58.293 --> 30:03.875
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you think about it, even just like four years ago, did it seem like E3 was such this big deal that like

30:04.375 --> 30:08.797
[SPEAKER_00]: TV stations were broadcasting live and the internet was lit up with talk and all that.

30:08.877 --> 30:13.979
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, you heard about E3 and you read about it in magazines, but was it really such a freaking big deal as it is now?

30:14.120 --> 30:16.581
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, now it's like the holiday of gamers, it seems like.

30:16.621 --> 30:18.622
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how things are and the companies are catering to it.

30:18.662 --> 30:19.882
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's pretty smart on their end.

30:20.142 --> 30:21.003
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's interesting.

30:21.143 --> 30:21.723
[SPEAKER_00]: Loki, any thoughts?

30:21.897 --> 30:30.199
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree with some of the aspects like when he's talking about like basically your fry cooks of the video game industry getting into E3.

30:30.819 --> 30:35.621
[SPEAKER_01]: Granted that there are these people getting into E3 and this is why you have your three hour waits to go see stuff.

30:35.981 --> 30:48.204
[SPEAKER_01]: It's because of all these nobodies that are entering into E3 that have really no business being there other than the fact that oh I work for a video game or a game store or I work at a store that sells games or

30:48.604 --> 30:52.228
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that the retailers need to actually have some sort of signed release.

30:52.268 --> 30:59.016
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's not management, then the general everybody else would need a signed release form to go with it.

30:59.136 --> 31:00.437
[SPEAKER_03]: You provide that with your credentials.

31:01.218 --> 31:06.464
[SPEAKER_03]: There's also the people, though, who get in once, and then every year they get their new invite.

31:08.208 --> 31:10.251
[SPEAKER_03]: I got mine this year the same way.

31:10.512 --> 31:17.264
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that's because maybe the attendance thing is a selling point of the whole show so they want more people to go even if it's cheapening the show?

31:17.404 --> 31:18.226
[SPEAKER_03]: It is advertisement.

31:19.448 --> 31:20.690
[SPEAKER_03]: It puts money in their pockets.

31:22.310 --> 31:27.691
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's still all those people who are willing to go out there and shell out the 300 some odd dollars it costs for a badge.

31:28.271 --> 31:30.112
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there will be changes next year.

31:30.152 --> 31:32.852
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's inevitable there will be some type of change next year.

31:32.952 --> 31:33.813
[SPEAKER_00]: But who knows?

31:33.893 --> 31:34.793
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been proven wrong before.

31:35.933 --> 31:36.293
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright.

31:37.093 --> 31:37.674
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving on.

31:38.314 --> 31:39.334
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought this was interesting.

31:39.614 --> 31:41.775
[SPEAKER_00]: 1up.com actually ran this story earlier this week.

31:41.795 --> 31:42.515
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it was cute.

31:42.535 --> 31:42.815
[SPEAKER_00]: 80 year old

31:44.329 --> 31:45.089
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for watching!

32:02.040 --> 32:02.820
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for watching!

32:21.529 --> 32:28.752
[SPEAKER_00]: and she got a call from gaming legend Billy Mitchell who offered to loan her a Qbert machine to practice and win back the title.

32:29.152 --> 32:32.614
[SPEAKER_00]: So gaming grandma's back to reclaim the Qbert throne.

32:32.814 --> 32:35.795
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to laugh if she was playing Halo 2 or something like that, you know.

32:36.916 --> 32:38.056
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to get you!

32:38.136 --> 32:42.118
[SPEAKER_03]: In general, because I suck at Qbert and I played a whole crap load of it on my Clicca Vision.

32:43.104 --> 32:43.505
[SPEAKER_00]: Me too.

32:43.525 --> 32:44.285
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you imagine?

32:44.365 --> 32:50.850
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's bad enough getting fragged by the 12-year-olds on Xbox Live who then proceed to tease you and, you know, call you names.

32:51.150 --> 32:52.851
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you imagine getting shot by Grandma?

32:55.574 --> 32:56.054
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

32:56.114 --> 32:57.015
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, yes.

32:57.455 --> 33:02.158
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember back when I had my Nintendo and my mother played it more than I did.

33:03.379 --> 33:06.362
[SPEAKER_03]: Granted, my mother is only 17 years older than I am, but still.

33:06.742 --> 33:11.445
[SPEAKER_00]: The only game I could ever get my mother to play with me was Family Feud on the Commodore 64.

33:12.665 --> 33:15.566
[SPEAKER_03]: My mom was like freaking awesome at Super Mario Brothers.

33:15.706 --> 33:17.027
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's all foreign to me.

33:17.067 --> 33:21.168
[SPEAKER_03]: My parents... And she would regularly kick my ass at Dr. Mario.

33:21.368 --> 33:26.930
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's weird because my dad now watches G4 because he loved tech TV.

33:27.371 --> 33:32.672
[SPEAKER_00]: And although he's been kind of ticked off at the fact that when G4 kind of ate tech TV, all the shows got lost.

33:33.033 --> 33:34.713
[SPEAKER_00]: He's still... It's like he clings to it.

33:35.514 --> 33:39.275
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think because of that, he's picked up all this gaming knowledge, which is kind of impressive.

33:39.555 --> 33:40.115
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cute.

33:40.435 --> 33:40.916
[SPEAKER_00]: It is cute.

33:40.956 --> 33:41.356
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very cute.

33:41.376 --> 33:41.896
[SPEAKER_00]: My dad's cute.

33:43.550 --> 33:45.291
[SPEAKER_00]: Loki, is this going to be you someday?

33:45.311 --> 33:46.891
[SPEAKER_00]: 80-year-old gaming grandpa?

33:47.331 --> 33:47.551
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

33:49.072 --> 33:52.092
[SPEAKER_01]: Seriously, I'm going to be the coolest dad on the block.

33:52.232 --> 33:54.393
[SPEAKER_01]: I have my own goddamn video game cabinet.

33:54.953 --> 33:56.434
[SPEAKER_01]: How many dads can say that?

33:57.134 --> 34:00.475
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember the days before we had this hologram shit.

34:01.315 --> 34:02.896
[SPEAKER_01]: When I'm old, though.

34:02.976 --> 34:05.776
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be in line as the 80-year-old grandpa.

34:06.216 --> 34:07.197
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you're getting a free kid?

34:07.357 --> 34:08.777
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck that, give it for me!

34:09.357 --> 34:11.158
[SPEAKER_00]: I will still aspire...

34:12.264 --> 34:18.038
[SPEAKER_00]: to yell at kids who are walking on my lawn while I'm playing the PSP or something. 5.0.

34:21.570 --> 34:22.890
[SPEAKER_00]: My future, they won't be wearing pants.

34:22.910 --> 34:24.091
[SPEAKER_02]: Get off my lawn!

34:24.771 --> 34:26.892
[SPEAKER_02]: Give me back my video game!

34:47.978 --> 34:54.962
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the reason why the gaming site felt the need to run this story is that number three was Woot.

34:56.082 --> 34:56.923
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate that word.

34:57.483 --> 34:58.023
[SPEAKER_00]: Woot!

34:58.323 --> 35:00.084
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm surprised Pwned isn't on there.

35:00.605 --> 35:01.665
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm surprised that too.

35:01.705 --> 35:02.606
[SPEAKER_00]: Some other highlights.

35:02.626 --> 35:03.406
[SPEAKER_03]: This list is retarded.

35:03.506 --> 35:05.067
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one, Ginormous.

35:05.859 --> 35:06.779
[SPEAKER_00]: I use that word all the time.

35:06.799 --> 35:07.260
[SPEAKER_00]: I do use that.

35:07.400 --> 35:07.980
[SPEAKER_00]: I use it too.

35:08.020 --> 35:11.441
[SPEAKER_00]: Number two, confuzzled, whatever you want to say, confused and puzzled.

35:11.962 --> 35:20.445
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly, one I think is too good to pass up, number nine, snert, snow that is dirty, which is a word I never heard before seeing that poll.

35:20.686 --> 35:23.227
[SPEAKER_00]: But then again, we live in California, so maybe that's what it's about.

35:23.487 --> 35:23.987
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

35:25.708 --> 35:26.108
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

35:26.208 --> 35:28.029
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a couple more, just real quick.

35:28.109 --> 35:28.749
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yes, I'm sorry.

35:28.789 --> 35:31.190
[SPEAKER_00]: You had a couple stories from another website you wanted to share.

35:31.210 --> 35:31.410
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up?

35:31.430 --> 35:32.591
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I just want to share these.

35:33.686 --> 35:40.467
[SPEAKER_01]: The Game Boy Micro, the brand new Game Boy Advance that they're getting you to buy, is going to be marketed as a media player.

35:40.788 --> 35:44.248
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, why do you really want to watch movies on a one-inch screen?

35:44.328 --> 35:46.249
[SPEAKER_01]: But whatever.

35:46.429 --> 35:50.570
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, it's the Game Boy Micro bundled with the Play-Anne adapter.

35:50.850 --> 36:01.312
[SPEAKER_01]: For those who don't know, it uses the little SD cards to actually be able to play movies, and it plugs into your Game Boy Advance player, or your Game Boy Micro in this case.

36:02.413 --> 36:08.379
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, it's a $70 value that they're going to be marketing with that.

36:08.479 --> 36:10.822
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, 2-inch screen movies.

36:11.182 --> 36:12.483
[SPEAKER_01]: You think that's going to be popular?

36:12.503 --> 36:13.865
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

36:14.446 --> 36:19.171
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to see what the Game Boy Micro looks like, you can go to OrangeZoneRadio.com and check out my pictures of E3.

36:19.602 --> 36:20.222
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.

36:20.363 --> 36:20.863
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice plug.

36:20.883 --> 36:22.384
[SPEAKER_01]: He's so small.

36:22.964 --> 36:24.165
[SPEAKER_03]: It is really little, though.

36:24.585 --> 36:27.787
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't imagine playing a role-playing game where you have to read text on it, though.

36:29.248 --> 36:32.991
[SPEAKER_03]: Imagine trying to play Fire Emblem on that thing where you have to move your little tiny characters on it.

36:33.091 --> 36:34.091
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't imagine that.

36:34.332 --> 36:36.533
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't get the Game Boy Micro, but whatever.

36:36.733 --> 36:37.714
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, whatever.

36:38.955 --> 36:40.255
[SPEAKER_00]: There could be worse things.

36:40.275 --> 36:41.056
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the Virtual Boy.

36:41.076 --> 36:41.917
[SPEAKER_03]: It didn't look too bad.

36:43.301 --> 36:45.942
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple other things, now we go to the PSP side of things.

36:46.822 --> 36:57.624
[SPEAKER_01]: Heavy.com, those folks behind the wonderful stuff like Pimp My Weapon and the music that sucks, they have new PSP content you can download from their website.

36:57.984 --> 37:00.245
[SPEAKER_01]: So go check that out, and that's Heavy.com.

37:00.965 --> 37:08.867
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, on the underground front here, they have the Rin version 1.18, which is the brand new Game Boy...

37:09.447 --> 37:33.537
[SPEAKER_01]: Color Emulator and they're working on right now a working version of SNES 9X which is the Super Nintendo Emulator to work on the version 1.5 PSPs which are all the US ones because currently all the ones that they have right now only work on the Japanese models the first launch ones which are version 1.0 that reminds me of the other thing I've been playing this week Final Fantasy 6 ROM translated by fans

37:34.611 --> 37:35.032
[SPEAKER_03]: Saken Densetsu 3

37:50.886 --> 37:51.546
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard about that.

37:51.787 --> 37:52.467
[SPEAKER_03]: I played it.

37:52.507 --> 37:53.007
[SPEAKER_03]: It's excellent.

37:53.107 --> 37:54.848
[SPEAKER_03]: I also miss playing the Car Ranger game.

37:55.228 --> 38:04.552
[SPEAKER_01]: And the final story I will leave you with is, and this is my thing saying that no copyright protection scheme is perfect.

38:05.253 --> 38:11.395
[SPEAKER_01]: There will be a loader in the near future to be able to play games off the memory cards on the PSP.

38:11.755 --> 38:12.216
[SPEAKER_01]: It's coming.

38:12.416 --> 38:14.797
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be here soon and nothing's going to stop it.

38:16.418 --> 38:18.559
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that sounds like fighting words.

38:19.259 --> 38:19.519
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

[SPEAKER_00]: Final thoughts, you guys, Loki.

38:36.665 --> 38:42.926
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to get me some more Final Fantasy XI time under my belt because I've been slacking lately.

38:43.947 --> 38:46.947
[SPEAKER_00]: And my final thought is it's clubbing time, DarkSakura.

38:46.967 --> 38:49.288
[SPEAKER_03]: I reject false MMOs.

38:50.692 --> 38:53.676
