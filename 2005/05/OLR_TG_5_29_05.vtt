01:01.240 --> 01:02.520
Yeah, whatever.

01:02.520 --> 01:05.440
We're all here, live in the flesh, in the fresh.

01:05.440 --> 01:06.600
In the frat.

01:06.600 --> 01:07.920
I thought you said in the frat.

01:07.920 --> 01:08.520
We're fresh.

01:08.520 --> 01:10.480
We're fresh here at Orange Laundry in the flesh.

01:10.480 --> 01:11.360
Yo, yo, yo.

01:11.360 --> 01:14.200
No Skype in here, because Skype cuts out too much for us,

01:14.200 --> 01:15.480
so we can't do the Skype thing.

01:15.480 --> 01:17.460
Yeah, we're not like from yesterday.

01:17.460 --> 01:20.000
We were freshly purchased today.

01:20.000 --> 01:20.880
Big thank you.

01:20.880 --> 01:22.760
Big thank you, starting off the show tonight.

01:22.760 --> 01:25.280
Before we get into any games whatsoever, big, big thank you

01:25.280 --> 01:29.420
to iPotter.org and the one and only Adam Curry for, I guess,

01:29.420 --> 01:31.660
noticing us this week.

01:31.660 --> 01:32.940
Best hair ever.

01:32.940 --> 01:34.580
I agree.

01:34.580 --> 01:36.980
When I think of the 80s, I will always think of that hair.

01:36.980 --> 01:39.740
But seriously, we got noticed on iPotter.org this week,

01:39.740 --> 01:42.440
which is really weird because we didn't submit anything

01:42.440 --> 01:42.940
over there.

01:42.940 --> 01:45.020
So I don't know if one of our fans did it or what,

01:45.020 --> 01:46.820
but we just showed up on there suddenly.

01:46.820 --> 01:49.280
And usually I'm pretty good about submitting our show

01:49.280 --> 01:52.740
to like Podcast Alley, Podcast Pickle, Podcast this,

01:52.740 --> 01:54.140
Podcast that, whatever shows up.

01:54.140 --> 01:58.720
have a podcast pick yes believe it or not it's it they got podcast everything

01:58.720 --> 02:05.480
it's it's the new thing like a from J inside about podcast poop shoot yes

02:05.480 --> 02:10.840
somebody is probably registering it as we speak but regardless for whatever

02:10.840 --> 02:14.780
reason we never got submitted to ipod or dot org until this week and it was huge

02:14.780 --> 02:20.560
for our traffic so welcome to all our new subscribers just a quick FYI what we

02:20.560 --> 02:24.640
what we do, Orange Lounge Radio, we've been around for like three years, we've

02:24.640 --> 02:29.240
only been podcasting since January, internet radio station that runs live 24

02:29.240 --> 02:33.240
hours a day, seven days a week, dedicated to rhythm and music gaming, but this is

02:33.240 --> 02:36.440
part of our expansion into other video games. We want to talk about other games

02:36.440 --> 02:40.680
and other gamings and video games that don't suck and news that you guys really

02:40.680 --> 02:44.080
want to know about. So that's what we're all about and we just want to produce

02:44.080 --> 02:47.560
for you guys like a 30-40 minute show, something long enough for you guys to

02:47.560 --> 02:50.840
listen to while you're commuting just to keep you up on all the news and all that

02:50.840 --> 02:55.120
stuff so and sometimes we like to argue and bicker back and forth and we do

02:55.120 --> 02:59.960
sometimes we do some things shut up we do bitch we do some things that are

02:59.960 --> 03:03.720
outside of games sometimes as well like dark soccer's advice column which we'll

03:03.720 --> 03:07.760
get to a little later exactly but first off strictly the games welcome back dark

03:07.760 --> 03:11.360
soccer you weren't here last week no I was busy being coma actually I was busy

03:11.360 --> 03:14.760
being submitted to episode 3 so this is the first time a lot of the iPod or

03:14.760 --> 03:18.480
folks get to hear your lovely voice so unless they download a previous episode

03:18.480 --> 03:24.000
that's right which I hope they did what's up how was your gaming week I

03:24.000 --> 03:30.040
played PSO blue burst for like four hours yesterday I quit Final Fantasy 11

03:30.040 --> 03:35.480
yesterday as I quit Final Fantasy 11 finally as well and the clouds came down

03:35.480 --> 03:42.120
and saying and it was pretty groovy and I played um some Silent Hill 3 I'm close

03:42.120 --> 03:45.760
to the end, and then the hospital right now.

03:45.760 --> 03:47.000
Oh, very cool.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
You know what though?

03:48.000 --> 03:52.340
You know you're addicted to MMOs though, seriously, when you quit Final Fantasy XI and then freaking

03:52.340 --> 03:53.480
sign up for Guild Wars.

03:53.480 --> 03:56.280
I mean, did I really accomplish anything?

03:56.280 --> 03:59.040
Did you really accomplish anything going from Final Fantasy XI to Blue Burst?

03:59.040 --> 04:05.960
Yeah, but with Blue Burst, it's windowed and I can do other crap while my little Fenerwhirl

04:05.960 --> 04:09.080
is regenerating her TP.

04:09.080 --> 04:13.800
I don't really see it as necessarily leaving one game for another, I just kind of see it

04:13.800 --> 04:17.760
as I'm bored with this toy and I want a new toy now.

04:17.760 --> 04:22.520
I've always gone back to PSO, but when Ragnarok 2 comes out, oh, you better watch.

04:22.520 --> 04:24.280
What is this, the fourth time on PSO?

04:24.280 --> 04:28.800
You got Dreamcast, GameCube, Xbox, now PC.

04:28.800 --> 04:34.000
Yeah, but the Dreamcast one pissed me off because it wouldn't work with the broadband

04:34.000 --> 04:35.040
converter they had.

04:35.040 --> 04:40.080
I didn't own a Dreamcast until years later when they were like $50, and I only bought

04:40.080 --> 04:42.400
it so I could emulate Nintendo games on it.

04:42.400 --> 04:46.000
But then I discovered that Soul Calibur is really cool, and I kind of went back and rediscovered

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
all these Dreamcast games.

04:48.000 --> 04:51.520
Soul Calibur is all about playing that game with the damn fishing rod.

04:51.520 --> 04:54.920
Because the fishing rod is analog.

04:54.920 --> 04:57.380
And when you sling it, it hits buttons.

04:57.380 --> 04:59.240
The triggers inside are buttons.

04:59.240 --> 05:02.600
So, rod caliber is the most fun ever.

05:02.600 --> 05:03.600
Wow.

05:03.600 --> 05:07.860
like people who play like Tekken with their DDR mats and I tried playing Soul

05:07.860 --> 05:12.960
Calibur with my DDR pad the only analog button on the Dreamcast dance pad is the

05:12.960 --> 05:17.080
Konami logo and it's only left and right that's odd all right all right anyway

05:17.080 --> 05:25.040
any other games you played this week step on the cat that's it is that a

05:25.040 --> 05:29.200
flash game all right no was when sure me is on the floor that gonna be an Xbox

05:29.200 --> 05:33.920
360 launch title and you step on her not very hard and she just flattens herself

05:33.920 --> 05:40.080
like this big ball of cat fat and looks up and goes no okay you can go yeah when

05:40.080 --> 05:45.520
she scatters off Loki step on the cat her favorite thing Loki white games

05:45.520 --> 05:50.840
you've been playing um actually I played Final Fantasy 11 because you all people

05:50.840 --> 05:51.840
Suck.

05:51.840 --> 05:57.000
Oh yeah, well at least I'm not leaving for another MMO, okay?

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
Sheesh.

05:58.000 --> 06:01.120
I don't know if that's better or worse, but anyways.

06:01.120 --> 06:07.600
So yeah, I have my character who's level 58 now, finally, and I bought new armor today,

06:07.600 --> 06:12.320
just a corpse plus one, because I will not settle for the ordinary armor, I have to have

06:12.320 --> 06:13.560
the plus one armor.

06:13.560 --> 06:19.000
You ever seen that shirt on the internet that says, I'm not a dork, I'm a level 12 paladin?

06:19.000 --> 06:20.520
That's what you're reminding me of right now.

06:20.520 --> 06:24.360
You're gonna be on the street one day with one of those cardboard pieces of thing.

06:24.360 --> 06:29.880
If you want to get technical, I am a level 12 paladin, but I play a level 58 black mage

06:29.880 --> 06:30.880
to be honest.

06:30.880 --> 06:31.880
My bad.

06:31.880 --> 06:33.880
We'll play FFXi for food.

06:33.880 --> 06:38.560
Oh no no, we'll give head for Final Fantasy, I don't know.

06:38.560 --> 06:39.560
Alright, let him finish.

06:39.560 --> 06:40.900
We'll give head for Final Fantasy.

06:40.900 --> 06:41.900
We got news to get to.

06:41.900 --> 06:47.200
Anyways, so I play Final Fantasy, I play a little bit of my cell phone game Worms, yeah

06:47.200 --> 06:48.200
you remember that game Worms?

06:48.200 --> 06:54.000
Well, it doesn't really transition well over to the cell phone a lot of games don't FYI for some reason

06:54.000 --> 06:59.380
I'm like they did he just get pissed off that I'm kicking their ass and they just they just committed suicide

06:59.400 --> 07:02.580
They just walk right off the screen into the water and die

07:02.580 --> 07:05.420
I'm like, what the hell kind of AI is that?

07:05.940 --> 07:11.240
Seriously, this is awesome mobile games now is all about the retro factor or

07:11.240 --> 07:14.520
or it's like bejeweled on your phone.

07:14.520 --> 07:17.520
It's like $5 for this piece of crap, yay.

07:17.520 --> 07:21.520
Bejeweled came on my phone as well. Yeah, so I played that and

07:21.520 --> 07:25.040
that's pretty much it. Really haven't played much as far as games this week.

07:25.040 --> 07:28.280
Alright. Myself, I actually

07:28.280 --> 07:31.280
picked up a copy of Fable because Fable was running

07:31.280 --> 07:35.360
on sale, $30, and it was one of those Xbox games where everybody was like,

07:35.360 --> 07:37.080
dude, if you have an Xbox, you have to have Fable.

07:37.080 --> 07:40.480
You have to have it. Because, like, you know, it's like the one RPG,

07:40.480 --> 07:44.080
classic RPG they have on Xbox. So I picked it up and

07:44.080 --> 07:49.720
it's kinda neat. I really really like the concept behind Fable where you can

07:49.720 --> 07:53.680
kinda forge your own destiny kinda thing. Like it's the first game I've ever

07:53.680 --> 07:56.600
played where you can aspire to be a gay whore

07:56.600 --> 08:00.120
if you want. And the game will still reward you for that. You can have your

08:00.120 --> 08:01.200
twelve houses with

08:01.200 --> 08:06.040
boyfriends if you want. I think if you hang around in the towns too long they chase

08:06.040 --> 08:06.640
you off.

08:06.640 --> 08:16.640
It depends on if you're good or bad, but you can completely play the game as a good guy or you can completely play as a bad guy, so you kind of forge your own path, which is kind of nice.

08:16.640 --> 08:22.640
And you can have the people refer to you as R-Space, because you get to choose your own title later on.

08:22.640 --> 08:25.640
And your character changes in appearance, depending on whether you're good or bad.

08:25.640 --> 08:28.640
Yeah, if you have your arm cut off, they call you stubby or something.

08:28.640 --> 08:34.080
Yeah, graphics, pretty nice, but the only problem I noticed with Fable is that sometimes

08:34.080 --> 08:38.440
it's a little bit skippy, like kind of like has some loading skips, awful long loading

08:38.440 --> 08:41.280
times in between areas though for such small areas.

08:41.280 --> 08:45.400
I'm kind of nitpicking a little bit though because honestly the cutscene graphics are

08:45.400 --> 08:47.120
really great.

08:47.120 --> 08:50.640
I really am impressed with the graphics mostly, but just little skips were a little bit annoying.

08:50.640 --> 08:55.240
The sound is awesome, the sound in the game, it's got its own like original score I think

08:55.240 --> 08:58.400
that was done by Danny Elfman, at least one of the songs, but the rest of the music really

08:58.400 --> 08:59.400
fits into that.

08:59.400 --> 09:04.360
The only problem I had with the sound though is that sometimes it was overbearing.

09:04.360 --> 09:07.800
Like for instance this one scene I'm trying to get trained on magic and I can't even hear

09:07.800 --> 09:11.040
the guy talking because all I can hear is the waterfall behind me.

09:11.040 --> 09:14.400
So the sound kind of gets annoying sometimes, but the score is really great.

09:14.400 --> 09:17.320
Like they could release the score as a CD and probably sell it.

09:17.320 --> 09:21.580
But overall I think the game's kind of fun, it has a lot of fun stuff going for it.

09:21.580 --> 09:25.760
So I'd probably give it like, I don't know, I'd give it an above average score, like a

09:25.760 --> 09:27.960
3 out of 5 stars.

09:27.960 --> 09:30.960
I'm not sure yet though I still gotta really play a little more with it I'm only like two

09:30.960 --> 09:33.720
hours into it so the verdict's still out but I'm having fun with it.

09:33.720 --> 09:34.720
Actually I did get a new game.

09:34.720 --> 09:35.800
What'd you get?

09:35.800 --> 09:36.800
Well Dan bought me Technic Beat.

09:36.800 --> 09:37.800
Oh what'd you think?

09:37.800 --> 09:38.800
I haven't played it yet.

09:38.800 --> 09:39.800
I played it.

09:39.800 --> 09:40.800
Oh well.

09:40.800 --> 09:42.600
I watched you play and I'm like oh Technic Beat.

09:42.600 --> 09:44.600
Tell us about it next week then.

09:44.600 --> 09:45.600
That'll work.

09:45.600 --> 09:46.720
It's still sitting on my desk.

09:46.720 --> 09:52.360
For those just tuning in I give Smart Bomb a 1 out of 5 because it sucks ass.

09:52.360 --> 09:53.500
Why is that?

09:53.500 --> 09:58.340
Because first off, the game has such long loading times and the puzzles are fucking

09:58.340 --> 10:02.440
hard and it makes you want to actually throw your PSP, which is never a feeling you should

10:02.440 --> 10:05.960
have with a PSP because they're expensive and if you throw it, it'll probably break.

10:05.960 --> 10:09.720
So I'm actually returning the game back because I don't want it.

10:09.720 --> 10:13.460
Speaking of the PSP, before we get into game news, this is one I want to know about.

10:13.460 --> 10:17.120
What was that game you were showing me, it was like a pinball game, but you played the

10:17.120 --> 10:20.800
PSP on its side, where it's like vertical up and down with some pinball game?

10:20.800 --> 10:27.680
It's actually this game called, it's two brand new games actually coming out from Hudson.

10:27.680 --> 10:31.440
And there's one, it's a pinball game, which is simply called pinball right now, and you

10:31.440 --> 10:36.600
actually hold the PSP on its right side, so basically you'd be using the triangle and

10:36.600 --> 10:41.160
X button, I believe, and you play it basically vertically.

10:41.160 --> 10:44.140
And there's also another game called Star Soldier, which is going to be coming out,

10:44.140 --> 10:48.980
which is also played that way, just like the old school vertical shooter games.

10:48.980 --> 10:56.040
Star Soldier wasn't that a Sega CD game I don't know I have no idea I know there

10:56.040 --> 10:59.180
was a game actually no I'm thinking turbo graphics duo there was a game

10:59.180 --> 11:03.680
called Star Soldier no maybe this is it and Hudson Hudson Hudson did a lot of

11:03.680 --> 11:10.040
games for graphics didn't they right and they did a a parody version called Star

11:10.040 --> 11:17.360
Parodia which you could play as Twinbee or you could play as a as a Bomberman

11:17.360 --> 11:24.020
because Hudson also did Bomberman or you could play as a flying PC engine I just

11:24.020 --> 11:28.400
think the idea of the PSP on its side is cute I don't know why but it's not

11:28.400 --> 11:32.600
innovative Bondi already did that with the WonderSwan but who how many people

11:32.600 --> 11:37.940
in America played the WonderSwan because you and who else okay now we're gonna

11:37.940 --> 11:43.220
get some emails but like Klonoa on WonderSwan we all know Klonoa it's like

11:43.220 --> 11:46.980
one of the key things that they still need to make more of but you um switch

11:46.980 --> 11:50.020
Besides, when you played that, depending on the level, you'd have vertical levels where

11:50.020 --> 11:54.580
you'd keep climbing up, and you would turn your Wonderswan around and play that way.

11:54.580 --> 11:58.060
So it's not a new idea, but it's something a lot of people haven't seen.

11:58.060 --> 11:59.060
Yeah.

11:59.060 --> 12:00.060
Granted.

12:00.060 --> 12:01.060
So, alright.

12:01.060 --> 12:03.620
Anyway, let's move on to some actual gaming news.

12:03.620 --> 12:07.620
Following up from E3, you guys remember when we went to the Final Fantasy concert, that

12:07.620 --> 12:12.380
guy who was emceeing, he's a voice actor in the game, and he said that he would be at

12:12.380 --> 12:15.540
E3 that Wednesday, because he was the voice of Tidus in the game.

12:15.540 --> 12:19.240
I never saw him there, but of course I wasn't hanging out at the Square Enix booth the whole

12:19.240 --> 12:20.240
time.

12:20.240 --> 12:24.080
But I remember whispering to Loker, I said, I bet you anything, it's about the upcoming

12:24.080 --> 12:25.940
voice actor strike.

12:25.940 --> 12:28.240
Because you know, just kind of the way he was phrasing things and stuff.

12:28.240 --> 12:33.800
And sure enough, game voice actors were out there picketing at E3.

12:33.800 --> 12:36.620
So I guess I assumed that he was going to be in the show.

12:36.620 --> 12:40.960
I wonder if they were picketing using, you know, the voices of the characters and stuff,

12:40.960 --> 12:41.960
because that would be great.

12:41.960 --> 12:44.920
You know, I didn't even see them anywhere.

12:44.920 --> 12:49.120
I might have missed it, but again, the E3 is so packed and crowded, I don't know.

12:49.120 --> 12:52.460
But the Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists

12:52.460 --> 12:58.100
are trying to negotiate a new agreement with game publishers regarding voice acting.

12:58.100 --> 13:02.940
Basically what it comes down to is that right now voice actors are paid a one-time fee upfront

13:02.940 --> 13:08.780
for their services, but no, no, no, voice actors want some type of payment based on

13:08.780 --> 13:13.220
the successes of the game, like, you know, residuals, if the game sells so many copies

13:13.220 --> 13:14.220
we want to cut it.

13:14.220 --> 13:19.920
royalties basically so what do you think is that sound fair they're entitled it's

13:19.920 --> 13:26.280
their talent being lent to the you know it happens to regular stage actors they

13:26.280 --> 13:31.040
still make money off you know like I was watching some special about Greece and

13:31.040 --> 13:36.000
they still get a regular check yeah for any money that the movie still makes

13:36.000 --> 13:40.760
only like a dollar or so but they still get it still something even I think that

13:40.760 --> 13:43.760
the same should apply to the voice actors you know what about the flip

13:43.760 --> 13:47.620
side of this where some a lot of folks say and I tend to think about this a

13:47.620 --> 13:52.160
little bit too where whereas you have the voice actors in movie based games

13:52.160 --> 13:55.880
where the game just isn't the same without the original voice actor take

13:55.880 --> 13:59.300
for instance I don't know Buffy and the Buffy game wasn't the same it wasn't in

13:59.300 --> 14:02.420
it it wasn't the Sarah Michelle Gellar right right but everybody else is there

14:02.420 --> 14:06.580
did that kind did did that one voice not being right kind of detract from the

14:06.580 --> 14:10.640
game I don't know maybe I don't know she sounded just like her well then let me

14:10.640 --> 14:13.740
think of a better example say you were trying to replace Marlon Brando in the

14:13.740 --> 14:17.420
upcoming Godfather game. That just wouldn't be the same, right? I don't know, maybe it's debatable.

14:17.420 --> 14:21.900
Not necessarily. Here's an example, kind of an old example, but Indiana Jones The Fate of Atlantis,

14:21.900 --> 14:25.500
it was not Harrison Ford doing Indiana Jones voice, still felt fine to me.

14:25.500 --> 14:31.740
True. So some folks say that, you know, does it really, really have to be the actual actor's

14:31.740 --> 14:38.060
voice? And the thing is why some people say, you know, you could probably find fanboys and girls

14:38.060 --> 14:43.660
that would be willing to do the voice acting for you for free or for minimum wage. So do you think

14:43.660 --> 14:49.160
do it I know and I said you're going I do it too but I don't know is that a is

14:49.160 --> 14:53.280
that an option can they really break the union thing are they gonna set themselves

14:53.280 --> 14:58.040
up for real comes down to is they need to actually be negotiating their

14:58.040 --> 15:01.880
contract a little bit better that's what it comes down to if you want to get paid

15:01.880 --> 15:05.160
by royalties don't take the job then okay then let me kind of rephrase my

15:05.160 --> 15:09.200
question this way how important is voice acting in a game to you pretty important

15:09.200 --> 15:12.320
since a lot of the games are reliant on that to go along with the visual

15:12.320 --> 15:15.320
especially need good voice acting

15:15.320 --> 15:18.920
but even now I say even when there's bad voice acting you can make a game great

15:18.920 --> 15:20.280
case in point Resident Evil

15:20.280 --> 15:23.280
yeah or Castlevania

15:23.280 --> 15:26.680
psychic zone evil zone that was it

15:26.680 --> 15:30.440
honestly though if the game as a whole were like

15:30.440 --> 15:34.960
a hundred okay the voice acting would probably be fall under about three

15:34.960 --> 15:38.640
to me three points out of a hundred that's how much it paid

15:38.640 --> 15:42.240
you know how much I care about it really is a man good voice acting to me to make

15:42.240 --> 15:42.920
a break a game

15:42.920 --> 15:46.040
I think the voice acting to make a good game better

15:46.040 --> 15:49.960
but I don't think you can save a game I mean a crappy game still a crappy game

15:49.960 --> 15:50.720
you could have

15:50.720 --> 15:55.080
the guy who does all the movie trailers who has the sexiest voice in the world

15:55.080 --> 15:56.120
mister movie phone

15:56.120 --> 15:58.880
or we get the movie phone guy you could have either than the game at the game

15:58.880 --> 15:59.760
sucks the game sucks

15:59.760 --> 16:03.200
you know though especially though for

16:03.200 --> 16:06.520
games that are ported over from Japanese is where they redid all the voices

16:06.520 --> 16:11.160
half the time I expect it to be awful, so I like to be pleasantly surprised when there's

16:11.160 --> 16:14.440
good voice acting in it.

16:14.440 --> 16:20.480
And nowadays, I expect there to be good voice acting, and if there's not, I'm disappointed.

16:20.480 --> 16:25.080
So I think that they should be rewarded for the quality of their work, but I do think

16:25.080 --> 16:29.640
that because they do put so much work, it's acting the same as anything on the stage,

16:29.640 --> 16:31.120
and they should be rewarded for it.

16:31.120 --> 16:33.440
Okay, well I can go with that.

16:33.440 --> 16:36.200
Regardless though, here's the bottom line.

16:36.200 --> 16:37.880
Why do we have to fight all the time, guys?

16:37.880 --> 16:39.760
Can't we all just get along?

16:39.760 --> 16:40.760
How about a hug?

16:40.760 --> 16:41.760
Sorry, Rob, that doesn't work.

16:41.760 --> 16:42.760
How about a hug?

16:42.760 --> 16:49.020
Can't the voice actors in the gaming publishing companies just hug?

16:49.020 --> 16:51.240
Xbox 360 is on the way.

16:51.240 --> 16:53.720
$300 is the rumored price point.

16:53.720 --> 16:58.980
I always thought 360 would probably be what they'd charge for it, you know, ha ha ha,

16:58.980 --> 17:00.800
get it, Xbox 360, 360.

17:00.800 --> 17:05.000
they're still saying that that's a possibility but that 300 is kind of the

17:05.000 --> 17:09.980
target price point for the new system so based on what you saw at e3 is this

17:09.980 --> 17:17.300
worth $300 like yes it was brilliant really yes I paid 300 from my PlayStation

17:17.300 --> 17:22.820
2 might as well I paid 400 for my jps to allow me to be the first to say no I

17:22.820 --> 17:28.620
will wait for the first price cut I am more I've just I'm not really sold on

17:28.620 --> 17:33.380
any of the launch titles yet my opinion could change but there is nothing on the

17:33.380 --> 17:36.960
xbox that's making me go I have to have this system when it launches do I want

17:36.960 --> 17:41.700
the system yes eventually wait wait here here's what's selling it for me all

17:41.700 --> 17:49.460
right what do a volleyball too I know it's not but it's coming it will be good

17:49.460 --> 17:52.980
I'm looking forward to do a for and then I've been actually looking forward to

17:52.980 --> 17:58.220
quake for it looks pretty cool I'm more excited to is on it I'm honestly more

17:58.220 --> 18:02.100
excited about PS3 right now, and so I feel like I want to save my money and get a PS3.

18:02.100 --> 18:05.780
I did also go to the PS3 demo, well you know I'm going to have them both, so it doesn't

18:05.780 --> 18:06.780
matter.

18:06.780 --> 18:12.260
Honestly, when it gets down to about the Xbox 360 time, we'll already have the game room

18:12.260 --> 18:15.660
at my work, and we'll have a 360 there, so I really don't need to buy one.

18:15.660 --> 18:19.440
Here's what I'll bet they'll do, I'll bet you anything this is what happens, although

18:19.440 --> 18:21.460
I could be wrong.

18:21.460 --> 18:25.940
They'll sell the system for like $300, they'll do like a bare bones thing for $300, but if

18:25.940 --> 18:31.220
buy the 360, they'll do some kind of cheap little time where it's like the 360 pack or

18:31.220 --> 18:36.660
something that'll go for $360 and it comes with a game and like Xbox Live for so many

18:36.660 --> 18:39.020
months or something, you know, a pretty controller.

18:39.020 --> 18:43.820
It'll come with a game, it'll come with another controller, it'll come with brand new game

18:43.820 --> 18:44.820
skins!

18:44.820 --> 18:45.820
Woo!

18:45.820 --> 18:47.180
And new power button things.

18:47.180 --> 18:51.020
I do think that they are being smart with how they're combating the PS3 release because

18:51.020 --> 18:52.900
they're going to be doing Halo 3.

18:52.900 --> 18:54.300
Yeah, we talked about that on a previous show.

18:54.300 --> 18:55.300
That is smart.

18:55.300 --> 18:56.300
That is very smart.

18:56.300 --> 18:59.440
Yeah, it is, but I think the hardcore gamer is not going to be affected.

18:59.440 --> 19:00.440
Honestly.

19:00.440 --> 19:03.200
I did stay in line though for both demos.

19:03.200 --> 19:08.520
And I have to say though that, you know, the Xbox 360, I'm really looking forward to a

19:08.520 --> 19:13.640
lot, because not only is it a system, but it's also a multimedia docking station.

19:13.640 --> 19:16.960
And it even showed a picture of a PSP hooking up to it.

19:16.960 --> 19:19.880
Anything basically that's USB firewire is going to hook up to it.

19:19.880 --> 19:25.040
And that lends more use than just a video game system.

19:25.040 --> 19:28.040
meant to be an all-encompassing entertainment system.

19:28.040 --> 19:31.520
Well, I've said this before, the next generation of gaming is about more than just gaming.

19:31.520 --> 19:35.000
How would you like to watch your UMD movies on an HDTV?

19:35.000 --> 19:38.580
You can't watch your UMD movies on HDTV with this thing.

19:38.580 --> 19:43.140
All it's going to be is just, oh look, I can now load my MP3s that I bought with on Xbox

19:43.140 --> 19:45.980
Live to my MP3 player.

19:45.980 --> 19:46.980
I think you're right.

19:46.980 --> 19:48.400
There's a lot more than that though.

19:48.400 --> 19:53.280
It's going to an entertainment system, not just gaming.

19:53.280 --> 19:58.640
They're also showing this one about designing your own shirts on there, having them shipped

19:58.640 --> 20:01.600
out as a t-shirt, and you can sell them through the Xbox system.

20:01.600 --> 20:02.600
They had them on there.

20:02.600 --> 20:06.580
Are they going to be crappy, like a certain nameless site, which does a lot of shirt printing

20:06.580 --> 20:09.080
for people, and then the shirts wash out after they wash out?

20:09.080 --> 20:10.080
I don't know.

20:10.080 --> 20:15.200
It didn't say anything about that, but it's saying, though, that you can market your art,

20:15.200 --> 20:19.520
you can show your designs, you can share, you can create a community real-time chat.

20:19.520 --> 20:20.520
Wow.

20:20.520 --> 20:22.520
Last time I checked, I thought that's what the internet was for.

20:22.520 --> 20:27.800
I mean, why do I have to pay $300 for this console that I can do what, you know, I can

20:27.800 --> 20:28.960
do on the internet for free?

20:28.960 --> 20:31.600
Uh, no, sorry, I'm not gonna do that.

20:31.600 --> 20:32.600
I don't give crap.

20:32.600 --> 20:34.760
A gaming console is a gaming console is a gaming console.

20:34.760 --> 20:36.640
It's not a multimedia, you know, device.

20:36.640 --> 20:38.840
If I wanted a multimedia device, I'll buy a media PC.

20:38.840 --> 20:41.280
Oh, wait, no, I'm not gonna touch that either because they're expensive and you just...

20:41.280 --> 20:42.760
How about a big whatever to all of that?

20:42.760 --> 20:45.360
A system is only good as the games that are on it.

20:45.360 --> 20:46.360
There you go.

20:46.360 --> 20:47.360
There you go.

20:47.360 --> 20:50.480
Of course, though, I was more impressed with the PS3 demo and, you know, I really liked

20:50.480 --> 20:55.520
don't want to be a hoarder Sony but watching Jin sweat just made me all

20:55.520 --> 21:00.520
gushy I know I'm holding out for Nintendo's revolution laugh at me now

21:00.520 --> 21:05.000
but I'll tell you what when those first screenshots come out of Mario and link

21:05.000 --> 21:10.360
on the revolution your boner will be nice had they put forth the goods at e3

21:10.360 --> 21:14.920
I I think I think they could I think that might have shot him in the foot I

21:14.920 --> 21:20.360
don't think it did I already knew it's revolutionary what the controller the

21:20.360 --> 21:25.280
controller is going to be mappable basically it's your it's a custom

21:25.280 --> 21:29.840
controller every game that you play is going to be a brand new controller we'll

21:29.840 --> 21:33.240
see I think that it's going to be like that what was that Atari thing where you

21:33.240 --> 21:36.960
hooked it to your head and then it you know you blink in it makes a move left

21:36.960 --> 21:40.440
you lift your right that's retarded retarded please don't all right all

21:40.440 --> 21:49.720
right Duke Nukem forever forever before it comes out the message boards on Duke

21:49.720 --> 21:57.680
Nukem Forever's website located on their message board they're teasing it

21:57.680 --> 22:01.800
15 enemies supposed to be showing up in there they and they're pre they're

22:01.800 --> 22:06.080
saying they're swearing a ton is done we have hundreds of props you can place in

22:06.080 --> 22:11.040
the world and the artists just continue to pump stuff out all right they're

22:11.040 --> 22:17.720
saying they're gonna show it at next year's e3 huh yeah yeah yeah yeah let's

22:17.720 --> 22:22.760
see the goods people let's see the goods but it makes me sad we haven't had a Duke

22:22.760 --> 22:26.840
Duke Nukem yeah it's like phantom where'd the phantom go that's right it's

22:26.840 --> 22:32.760
not in the trash all right yeah but the gizmondo is still hanging about all

22:32.760 --> 22:38.120
right let's get to the advice column because you know if we sat here and we

22:38.120 --> 22:42.640
talked about games all day long we'd have no time to go out and go to golf

22:42.640 --> 22:53.200
clubs so we have we have to fill your heads with useless or useless I'm sorry

22:53.200 --> 22:59.880
solid information bad MC tonight yeah useful knowledge that you can use out

22:59.880 --> 23:03.480
there in the real world so go outside once in a while or use the games here

23:03.480 --> 23:11.680
you go dark sacral what are we learning about tonight today's advice is how to

23:11.680 --> 23:17.560
survive in whitewater rapids after falling out of your raft. Number one, if

23:17.560 --> 23:20.960
you were thrown from the raft, lie on your back face up with your feet facing

23:20.960 --> 23:27.480
downstream. Two, if your raft is still accessible swim for it and hold on. Even

23:27.480 --> 23:30.280
if it is upside down it can still provide protection from rocks and other

23:30.280 --> 23:36.040
obstacles. Three, be aware of the current and of river conditions. If you get to a

23:36.040 --> 23:40.240
calm area between rapids vigorously swim for the shore.

23:40.240 --> 23:41.240
4.

23:41.240 --> 23:46.000
Be prepared for a hole in the river where water recirculates, creating a whirlpool that

23:46.000 --> 23:47.800
can pull you under.

23:47.800 --> 23:52.160
If you are caught in a hole, plunge your feet down as far as you can and actively swim to

23:52.160 --> 23:53.160
the bottom.

23:53.160 --> 23:55.400
You will soon be pulled from the hole by the current.

23:55.400 --> 23:58.000
But my final piece of advice?

23:58.000 --> 23:59.000
Yes.

23:59.000 --> 24:02.040
Just don't go whitewater rafting.

24:02.040 --> 24:04.160
Go like hiking or something.

24:04.160 --> 24:06.160
At least the bears are kinder.

24:08.160 --> 24:09.160
Thank you for that.

24:09.160 --> 24:10.160
Remember, the bears?

24:10.160 --> 24:12.160
Useful, very useful piece of information.

24:12.160 --> 24:14.160
Everybody on the internet can use.

24:14.160 --> 24:16.160
The bears are more afraid of you than they are of them.

24:16.160 --> 24:18.160
Yeah, sit those sticks at them.

24:19.160 --> 24:22.160
Loki, you were playing the Matrix online for what, like a week?

24:22.160 --> 24:23.160
Yup.

24:23.160 --> 24:26.160
You were a big fan of the Matrix movies, even the second and third ones, right?

24:26.160 --> 24:28.160
I still watch them.

24:28.160 --> 24:33.160
I would have liked the second movie to have been what I read as the preview script.

24:33.160 --> 24:39.880
But apparently they they punked it down. Yeah, so how do you feel about this in the matrix online this week?

24:39.880 --> 24:41.360
They offed Morpheus

24:41.360 --> 24:46.880
I think it's too early to be doing this to be honest because I mean granted the game everyone loved

24:46.880 --> 24:48.340
You know the fact that you know

24:48.340 --> 24:52.440
The main characters were in it and stuff and I thought that they could drag down longer

24:52.440 --> 24:59.340
But it just giving the you know, the basic description of what happened, you know, apparently it looks like I guess Morpheus

24:59.340 --> 25:02.520
I got it. Oh, you got it. Okay. Well anyways Morpheus is basically

25:02.520 --> 25:07.400
one of the plot lines, or storylines through this, is he's searching for Neo's body.

25:07.400 --> 25:10.760
He's trying to get Neo back, because I think he thinks he's alive or something like that.

25:10.760 --> 25:15.080
Anyways, so he's trying to recover Neo's body from the machines, but when the machines refused

25:15.080 --> 25:19.880
to return Neo's remains, Morpheus began rampaging through Mega City, which is the city that

25:19.880 --> 25:25.840
this all takes place in, detonating code bombs strong enough to threaten the Matrix itself.

25:25.840 --> 25:29.520
The machines responded by sending an assassin after Morpheus.

25:29.520 --> 25:32.880
the assassin succeeded and Morpheus was killed.

25:32.880 --> 25:37.640
And basically now there's a new story arc, I guess, where players in the game are now

25:37.640 --> 25:44.080
able to investigate the circumstances of Morpheus' death and participate in the new Matrix saga.

25:44.080 --> 25:46.840
So now they're trying to figure out who the assassin is, I guess.

25:46.840 --> 25:47.840
I guess.

25:47.840 --> 25:49.920
And really there's like three sides to this.

25:49.920 --> 25:53.780
You have like, you have the, you got a weird buzzing, sorry about that guys, alright.

25:53.780 --> 26:01.620
have the Zionist groups or whatever and then you've got the I guess the machines and then

26:01.620 --> 26:02.620
some other.

26:02.620 --> 26:03.620
And the one-armed man.

26:03.620 --> 26:04.980
Yeah the one-armed man.

26:04.980 --> 26:10.300
But basically what it comes down to is at any time during this whole thing they could

26:10.300 --> 26:14.620
just say oh we're going to resurrect him and he's back so you know whatever.

26:14.620 --> 26:18.500
I think it's a little early to do that just because I don't know how long they're playing

26:18.500 --> 26:19.500
the run.

26:19.500 --> 26:20.500
It was his sister.

26:20.500 --> 26:22.900
It's always their sister that kills them.

26:22.900 --> 26:31.100
Well honestly, okay, other than Neo, Trinity, and Morpheus, well guess what, they've killed

26:31.100 --> 26:34.660
off all of them already, so who's left?

26:34.660 --> 26:36.660
So I couldn't tell you.

26:36.660 --> 26:37.660
Jadapinkit?

26:37.660 --> 26:38.660
No.

26:38.660 --> 26:45.420
Alright, let's talk about this article.

26:45.420 --> 26:47.080
I think this one's kind of interesting.

26:47.080 --> 26:52.180
I was looking at Slashdot earlier this week and they actually linked to somebody's blog,

26:52.180 --> 26:57.820
And this is on a site called corpnews.com and somebody is just talking about E3 and

26:57.820 --> 27:00.900
I'm just going to kind of skim through this article, read you guys some quotes on the

27:00.900 --> 27:01.900
blog.

27:01.900 --> 27:06.620
If you want to check this out, corpnews.com slash node slash 37, title's called Where

27:06.620 --> 27:10.620
Have All the Flowers Gone?

27:10.620 --> 27:15.700
And it's saying E3 is no longer useful as a trade show.

27:15.700 --> 27:19.000
And then the person goes on to talk about how they feel that it's just kind of inundated

27:19.000 --> 27:21.080
with so many people there.

27:21.080 --> 27:25.520
the folks that work at the Best Buy, the EB Games, the CompUSA, that it's become more

27:25.520 --> 27:31.040
about these booth babes and showing things off, and that it's not very professional.

27:31.040 --> 27:36.440
The only place that you can find the professionalism is to go to the upstairs area where it's nice

27:36.440 --> 27:38.440
and quiet.

27:38.440 --> 27:41.780
And they're basically saying that a lot of the game companies have gotten a little more

27:41.780 --> 27:47.200
and I'm sorry, I'm paraphrasing, if you want to read the complete story, go to the website.

27:47.200 --> 27:51.120
You're basically saying that a lot of the companies are getting very stingy.

27:51.120 --> 27:55.040
Companies like Vivendi and EA will ask for a name right off the bat before admitting

27:55.040 --> 27:56.840
you to their corporate Shangri-La.

27:56.840 --> 28:01.800
Blizzard was running World of Warcraft media demos on the noisy show floor, and Nintendo

28:01.800 --> 28:07.080
did not even have enough press kits for all media, saying, we only give those out to major

28:07.080 --> 28:08.080
media outlets.

28:08.080 --> 28:09.080
I got one.

28:09.080 --> 28:12.720
Yeah, and I'm thinking Dark Sakura got one somehow.

28:12.720 --> 28:13.720
Major media outlets.

28:13.720 --> 28:15.840
Then again, I did get mine on Wednesday.

28:15.840 --> 28:17.840
Oh, maybe.

28:17.840 --> 28:19.840
Well, we're a major media outlet, right?

28:19.840 --> 28:27.840
Well, the thing is that, you know, once we get our paperwork back, we're gonna be up there.

28:27.840 --> 28:29.840
We can only get bigger.

28:29.840 --> 28:33.840
So, it's good that they're willing to give us, you know, growing people.

28:33.840 --> 28:39.840
Granted, folks, we cover the news, I mean, the gaming news better than, like, say, you know, Fox News or something like that.

28:39.840 --> 28:44.620
Okay, well, us aside, even though I love to talk about us as well, what do you think?

28:44.620 --> 28:48.540
Is E3 still a useful trade show, or has it become a joke?

28:48.540 --> 28:52.020
They've started understanding that it is the everyday people who are getting there, so

28:52.020 --> 28:56.820
they show just enough to get them excited to, it's basically word of mouth advertising

28:56.820 --> 28:58.460
is what they're trying to do.

28:58.460 --> 29:04.560
And then, for the ones who are true media, they're saving the real juicy bits, like when

29:04.560 --> 29:10.560
When I got to play Papakaros, or seeing the new front mission, that was pretty cool.

29:10.560 --> 29:19.720
Or the Call of Cthulhu demo that they were showing, where you talk to their reps, find

29:19.720 --> 29:21.600
out, hey, this is what's going on.

29:21.600 --> 29:22.600
These are our dates.

29:22.600 --> 29:23.600
This is what it's going to do.

29:23.600 --> 29:25.280
This is what our business is looking like.

29:25.280 --> 29:30.560
I do agree that that's why they have those press rooms, so that you can go up and get

29:30.560 --> 29:36.220
Get figures, get the business side of things, get dates, things like that.

29:36.220 --> 29:39.540
See the stuff that they're not going to put out on the main floor.

29:39.540 --> 29:44.660
I really do think that the main floor is a method of advertising.

29:44.660 --> 29:46.340
But that's not always the way it used to be.

29:46.340 --> 29:49.340
If you think about it, it's really ballooned in the past few years and I think that's what

29:49.340 --> 29:52.120
this guy is kind of trying to say because he's saying he's been for like the past six

29:52.120 --> 29:55.920
years and just he's kind of watched this whole thing evolve and that's what I think the core

29:55.920 --> 29:58.180
thing is, is that E3 has really evolved.

29:58.180 --> 30:02.320
I mean, if you think about it, even just like four years ago, did it seem like E3 was such

30:02.320 --> 30:07.640
this big deal that, like, TV stations were broadcasting live and the internet was lit

30:07.640 --> 30:08.960
up with talk and all that?

30:08.960 --> 30:12.280
Sure, you know, you heard about E3 and you read about it in magazines, but was it really

30:12.280 --> 30:14.080
such a freaking big deal as it is now?

30:14.080 --> 30:16.760
I mean, now it's like the holiday of gamers, it seems like.

30:16.760 --> 30:18.640
That's how things are and the companies are catering to it.

30:18.640 --> 30:20.160
I think it's pretty smart on their end.

30:20.160 --> 30:21.160
Yeah, it's interesting.

30:21.160 --> 30:22.160
Loki, any thoughts?

30:22.160 --> 30:26.480
I agree with some of the aspects, like, when he's talking about, like, basically your fry

30:26.480 --> 30:32.400
cooks of the video game industry getting into E3. Granted, there are these people getting

30:32.400 --> 30:36.480
into E3, and this is why you have your three hour waits to go see stuff. It's because of

30:36.480 --> 30:41.440
all these nobodies that are entering into E3 that have really no business being there

30:41.440 --> 30:46.880
other than the fact that, oh, I work for a video game, or a game store, or I work at

30:46.880 --> 30:48.520
a store that sells games.

30:48.520 --> 30:52.640
I think that the retailers need to actually have some sort of signed release. If it's

30:52.640 --> 30:57.180
not management, then you know, the general everybody else

30:57.180 --> 30:59.080
would need like a signed release form to go with it.

30:59.080 --> 31:01.140
You provide that with your credentials.

31:01.140 --> 31:04.600
There's also the people though who get in once

31:04.600 --> 31:08.440
and then every year they get their new invite automatically.

31:08.440 --> 31:10.320
I got mine last, you know, this year the same way.

31:10.320 --> 31:12.960
And do you think that's because maybe the attendance thing

31:12.960 --> 31:14.440
is a selling point of the whole show

31:14.440 --> 31:15.900
so they want more people to go

31:15.900 --> 31:17.320
even if it's cheapening the show?

31:17.320 --> 31:19.040
It is advertisement.

31:19.040 --> 31:20.980
It puts money in their pockets.

31:20.980 --> 31:24.900
things to think about. And there's still all those people who are willing to go out there

31:24.900 --> 31:27.800
and shell out the three hundred some odd dollars it costs for a badge.

31:27.800 --> 31:31.460
I think there will be changes next year. I think it's inevitable there will be

31:31.460 --> 31:33.260
some type of change next year but

31:33.260 --> 31:36.340
who knows, I've been proven wrong before. Alright.

31:36.340 --> 31:40.700
Moving on. I thought this was interesting. 1up.com actually ran this

31:40.700 --> 31:42.540
story earlier this week. I thought it was cute.

31:42.540 --> 31:46.420
80-year-old playing video games. 80-year-old Doris

31:46.420 --> 31:49.840
Self, living in Florida, for Lauderdale to be specific.

31:49.840 --> 31:54.400
She is, I guess, the self-proclaimed oldest gamer.

31:54.400 --> 32:01.560
She was the Qbert champion in 1984 with a score of 1,112,300 points.

32:01.560 --> 32:06.240
She was the oldest video game champ in the world at 58 years old.

32:06.240 --> 32:11.280
Unfortunately, the claim of oldest gamer was lost recently to a 72-year-old

32:11.280 --> 32:13.320
living in New Hampshire, John Lawton.

32:13.320 --> 32:17.000
But now she's being motivated to get back into it.

32:17.000 --> 32:21.200
She says she's sad when she lost the title she held for 20 years

32:21.200 --> 32:25.000
and she got a call from gaming legend Billy Mitchell who offered to loan her

32:25.000 --> 32:26.520
a Qbert machine

32:26.520 --> 32:31.480
to practice and win back the title. So gaming grandma's back to reclaim the

32:31.480 --> 32:32.000
Qbert

32:32.000 --> 32:35.920
throne. I was going to laugh if she was playing Halo 2 or something like that, you know.

32:35.920 --> 32:42.240
I'm going to get you! I'm going to get you in general because I suck at Qbert and I played a whole crap load of it on my Cliquavision.

32:42.240 --> 32:46.480
oh me too can you imagine I mean it's it's bad enough getting fragged by the

32:46.480 --> 32:50.440
12 year olds on Xbox live who then proceed to tease you and you know call

32:50.440 --> 32:56.680
you names can you imagine getting shot by grandma you know what unfortunately

32:56.680 --> 33:01.720
yes I remember back when I had my Nintendo and my mother played it more

33:01.720 --> 33:07.160
than I did granted my mother is only 17 years older than I am but still the only

33:07.160 --> 33:11.400
game I could ever get my mother to play with me was family feud on the Commodore

33:11.400 --> 33:16.560
64 my mom was like freaking awesome at Super Mario Brothers yeah that's all

33:16.560 --> 33:21.440
foreign to me my parents and she regularly kick my ass at dr. Mario but

33:21.440 --> 33:27.720
it's weird because my dad now watches g4 because he loved tech TV and although

33:27.720 --> 33:31.920
he's been kind of ticked off the fact that when g4 kind of ate tech TV all the

33:31.920 --> 33:36.560
shows got lost he still it's like he clings to it so I think because of that

33:36.560 --> 33:40.000
he's picked up all this gaming knowledge which is kind of impressive that's cute

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
It is cute. It's very cute. My dad's cute

33:43.320 --> 33:47.440
Loki is this gonna be used someday 80 year old gaming grandpa. Yeah

33:48.980 --> 33:51.960
Seriously, I'm gonna have like I'm gonna be the coolest dad on the block

33:51.960 --> 33:54.400
I have my own goddamn video game cabinet

33:54.520 --> 34:00.360
How many dads can say that but I I remember the days before we had this hologram shit

34:00.920 --> 34:05.720
When I am only having I'll be I'll be in line as the 80 year old grandpa

34:05.720 --> 34:10.900
Oh, you're getting free kid fuck that gift for me. I will still aspire

34:11.840 --> 34:18.020
To yell at kids who are taught or who are walking on my lawn while I'm playing the PSP or something

34:19.160 --> 34:21.160
5.0

34:21.160 --> 34:23.160
My future they won't be wearing

34:24.000 --> 34:28.200
All right, let me back my video game a last story for you guys tonight

34:28.200 --> 34:33.860
We actually talked about this a little bit on the three-hour program on orange launch radio.com this week that airs Sunday nights

34:33.860 --> 34:38.900
um this was too funny to pass up though for whatever reason games dot slash dot

34:38.900 --> 34:44.340
dot org posted this story it's about what is your favorite word that's not in

34:44.340 --> 34:49.060
the dictionary and it was a poll run by Miriam Webster I think the reason why

34:49.060 --> 34:56.620
the gaming site felt the need to run this story is that number three was woot

34:56.620 --> 35:01.980
woot I'm surprised pwned isn't on there I'm surprised that too some other

35:01.980 --> 35:02.980
Other highlights.

35:02.980 --> 35:03.980
This list is retarded.

35:03.980 --> 35:05.720
Number one, ginormous.

35:05.720 --> 35:06.720
I use that word all the time.

35:06.720 --> 35:07.720
I do use that.

35:07.720 --> 35:08.720
I use it too.

35:08.720 --> 35:12.020
Number two, confusled, confuzzled, whatever you want to say, confused and puzzled.

35:12.020 --> 35:18.260
And lastly, one I think is too good to pass up, number nine, snurt, snow that is dirty,

35:18.260 --> 35:20.740
which is a word I never heard before seeing that poll.

35:20.740 --> 35:23.860
But then again, we live in California, so maybe that's what it's about.

35:23.860 --> 35:24.860
All right.

35:24.860 --> 35:25.860
All right.

35:25.860 --> 35:27.980
I got a couple more, just real quick.

35:27.980 --> 35:28.980
Oh yes, I'm sorry.

35:28.980 --> 35:31.340
You had a couple stories from another website you wanted to share.

35:31.340 --> 35:33.720
Well, I just want to share these.

35:33.720 --> 35:38.820
The Game Boy Micro, the brand new Game Boy Advance that they're getting you to buy, is

35:38.820 --> 35:40.780
going to be marketed as a media player.

35:40.780 --> 35:45.140
Honestly, why do you really want to watch movies on a one-inch screen, but whatever,

35:45.140 --> 35:46.140
hey.

35:46.140 --> 35:50.940
Okay, it's going to be basically, it's the Game Boy Micro bundled with the Playan adapter,

35:50.940 --> 35:51.940
for those who don't know.

35:51.940 --> 35:58.180
It uses the little SD cards to actually be able to play movies, and it plugs into your

35:58.180 --> 36:02.500
Game Boy Advance Player, or your Game Boy Micro in this case.

36:02.500 --> 36:09.740
So basically, it's a $70 value that they're going to be marking with that, so yeah, two

36:09.740 --> 36:10.740
inch screen movies.

36:10.740 --> 36:12.660
You think that's going to be popular?

36:12.660 --> 36:13.660
I don't know.

36:13.660 --> 36:14.660
I mean, people...

36:14.660 --> 36:18.100
If you want to see what the Game Boy Micro looks like, you can go to orangejonesradio.com

36:18.100 --> 36:19.700
and check out my pictures of E3.

36:19.700 --> 36:20.700
There you go.

36:20.700 --> 36:21.700
Nice plug.

36:21.700 --> 36:22.700
It's so small!

36:22.700 --> 36:24.260
It is really little, though.

36:24.260 --> 36:28.100
I can't imagine playing a role-playing game where you have to read text on it, though.

36:28.100 --> 36:29.100
Oh man, I can't imagine.

36:29.100 --> 36:32.220
Imagine trying to play Fire Emblem on that thing where you have to move your little tiny

36:32.220 --> 36:33.220
characters on it.

36:33.220 --> 36:34.220
I can't imagine.

36:34.220 --> 36:36.660
Anyways, I don't get the Game Boy Micro, but whatever.

36:36.660 --> 36:39.060
I mean, whatever.

36:39.060 --> 36:41.100
There could be worse things, like the Virtual Boy.

36:41.100 --> 36:42.980
It didn't look too bad.

36:42.980 --> 36:47.060
A couple other things, now to go to the PSP side of things.

36:47.060 --> 36:53.340
Heavy.com, those folks behind the wonderful stuff like Pimp My Weapon and The Music That

36:53.340 --> 36:58.060
Sucks, they have new PSP content you can download from their website.

36:58.060 --> 37:03.580
go check that out and that's heavy.com and also on the underground front here

37:03.580 --> 37:10.100
they have the Rin version 1.18 which is the brand new Game Boy Color emulator

37:10.100 --> 37:16.060
and they're working on right now working version of SNES 9x which is the Super

37:16.060 --> 37:21.500
Nintendo emulator to work on the version 1.5 PSP's which are all the US ones

37:21.500 --> 37:25.480
because currently all the ones that they have right now only work on the Japanese

37:25.480 --> 37:29.760
models the first launch ones which are version 1.0 that reminds me of the other

37:29.760 --> 37:34.600
thing I've been playing this week Final Fantasy 6 ROM translated by fans that's

37:34.600 --> 37:38.120
cool stuff I can't believe guys take that much dedication to put that kind of

37:38.120 --> 37:40.320
stuff together that's awesome you know that I've been thinking about getting

37:40.320 --> 37:46.080
back into that I had started on was second and said to three there's I I

37:46.080 --> 37:50.080
couldn't get into that there's a fully translated bomb down to the graphics oh

37:50.080 --> 37:53.960
yeah I heard about that but I played it it's excellent now awesome is playing

37:53.960 --> 37:55.480
the car ranger game.

37:55.480 --> 38:03.280
And the final story I will leave you with is, and this is my thing saying that no copyright

38:03.280 --> 38:08.080
protection scheme is perfect, there will be a loader in the near future to be able to

38:08.080 --> 38:11.820
play games off the memory cards on the PSP.

38:11.820 --> 38:12.820
It's coming.

38:12.820 --> 38:15.800
It'll be here soon and nothing's going to stop it.

38:15.800 --> 38:18.640
Well, them sounds like fighting words.

38:18.640 --> 38:22.880
