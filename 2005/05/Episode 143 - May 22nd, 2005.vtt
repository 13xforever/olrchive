WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:27.920
Turn around, look at what you see

00:27.920 --> 00:35.920
In the face, the mirror of your dreams

00:35.920 --> 00:42.920
We are not here, hidden in the light

00:42.920 --> 00:45.920
Lifting on the pages

00:45.920 --> 00:53.920
With the answer to our never ending story

01:23.920 --> 01:27.920
To fall behind the clouds

01:27.920 --> 01:30.920
And then another rainbow

01:30.920 --> 01:37.920
Is the answer to our never ending story

01:42.920 --> 01:48.920
Story

02:18.920 --> 02:38.920
Shine my bear, for she may fade away And I'm your hand, the brother when you die

02:38.920 --> 02:41.920
Why won't you keep the secret?

02:41.920 --> 02:45.920
We'll fall behind the clouds

02:45.920 --> 02:48.920
Then along the rainbow

02:48.920 --> 02:53.920
Is the answer to another end

03:23.920 --> 03:38.420
Ooh, ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh, ooh

03:53.920 --> 04:15.840

04:28.340 --> 04:31.820
your way through crowds and stomp all over people to get to things you had to

04:31.820 --> 04:36.580
wait three freaking hours the line if you want to play Zelda and unfortunately

04:36.580 --> 04:42.180
not all the cast members made it out alive yes unfortunately not all of us

04:42.180 --> 04:47.580
made it out of e3 alive no we'll have more details on all of that when we come

04:47.580 --> 04:51.980
back but I'll tell you what tonight it is all about the music games at e3 and

04:51.980 --> 04:58.980
So it was a hell of a show, surprises that just blew the roof off and smacked you up.

04:58.980 --> 05:03.980
We'll talk more about that when we start the show after these opening credits.

05:03.980 --> 05:04.980
We'll be back.

07:22.700 --> 07:27.700
My name is Rob Roberts. You might know me as Sky. Joining me, as always, are my awesome co-hosts.

07:27.700 --> 07:32.700
In this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm is Jamie Summers. You know her better as Dark Sakura.

07:32.700 --> 07:37.700
No, I'm kidding. She's actually not here tonight. She died at E3. It's so sad.

07:37.700 --> 07:42.700
No, I'm kidding. She didn't die at E3.

07:42.700 --> 07:47.700
She just, she, she extended her vacation a little bit.

07:47.700 --> 07:56.700
You see, some of us went to E3 a couple days before it started, and some of us decided to stay a couple days after it was over.

07:56.700 --> 08:02.700
So, Jamie is on her way back this afternoon, or I'm sorry, this evening actually from LA, so she's not here.

08:02.700 --> 08:05.700
But who is here is the one and only Loki!

08:05.700 --> 08:08.700
I am here and I have pizza. That's always good.

08:08.700 --> 08:11.700
I did slash pizza and I got my Pizza Hut.

08:11.700 --> 08:16.700
by slash pizza means I drove my car over to the Taco Bell slash Pizza Hut

08:16.700 --> 08:17.300
Express

08:17.300 --> 08:20.400
and got myself pizza the old-fashioned way

08:20.400 --> 08:24.080
not the EverQuest way hell no I'm not gonna

08:24.080 --> 08:27.940
sign up for EverQuest just to get that lazy besides there's no Pizza Hut near my house

08:27.940 --> 08:28.740
that makes me sad

08:28.740 --> 08:32.340
you know speaking of EverQuest this is completely off subject but

08:32.340 --> 08:35.720
we actually I actually got to meet some of our quote unquote

08:35.720 --> 08:39.500
competitors although not really because you know all of us online radio stations are

08:39.500 --> 08:43.740
people in the same industry. Yeah, people in the same industry. I met the folks from

08:43.740 --> 08:50.220
MMO Radio who talk about nothing but EverQuest and, uh, what are the other, I don't even

08:50.220 --> 08:57.080
know, World of Warcraft and Guild Wars and all those types of games 24-7, so. If you

08:57.080 --> 09:01.260
think it's weird that there's stations out there dedicated to DDR, just know that there's

09:01.260 --> 09:06.800
other stations out there dedicated to other types of games. Anyway, we got a fun show

09:06.800 --> 09:11.120
for you guys tonight. It's just me and Loki. We actually don't have any other guests tonight.

09:11.120 --> 09:16.040
I know Rice Princess is actually here around. She's watching movies with my roommate, though,

09:16.040 --> 09:18.600
so I don't know if we'll be able to get her on, but maybe we'll get her...

09:18.600 --> 09:19.600
She's watching Fargo.

09:19.600 --> 09:22.840
Are they watching Fargo? Why? Why are they watching Fargo, of all things?

09:22.840 --> 09:27.360
I guess they want to, I don't know, watch someone get thrown through a wood chipper.

09:27.360 --> 09:31.040
How about watching a movie that wasn't really overrated? That sounds like fun.

10:01.040 --> 10:08.000
new song to play for you guys from EX2 and we have a bootleg copy of a song

10:08.000 --> 10:11.200
from Ultra Big Street this is too cool I can't wait to hear how this turns out

10:11.200 --> 10:14.680
we'll be back with more details on that after this started off with a little bit

10:14.680 --> 10:21.680
your rain will be back

10:44.680 --> 10:51.680
I cry out of my head

10:51.680 --> 10:57.680
And I don't know what I found

10:57.680 --> 11:08.680
Over and over, I feel it break me down

11:08.680 --> 11:18.680
Waiting for a gentle way, a gentle way, a gentle way

11:18.680 --> 11:23.680
On the sidewalk, on the city, on my streets just a whisper

11:23.680 --> 11:28.680
Busy people, going nowhere, they've been soaking the rain

11:28.680 --> 11:33.680
No compassion, nothing matters, my resistance is waning

11:33.680 --> 11:42.680
Like a flower in a basement waiting for our love, yeah

11:42.680 --> 12:09.480
Look at this summer baby, that's my philosophy It's all rubberneck and fancy, but that's

12:09.480 --> 12:18.480
Some people say I'm wasting time, but they don't really know

12:18.480 --> 12:23.480
Like what I see, see what I've got to give me

12:23.480 --> 12:25.480
Such a tall head, head, head

12:25.480 --> 12:31.480
Sitting on the back porch, all by myself

12:31.480 --> 12:39.480
Oh, King Mary Jane, I'm with somebody else, baby

12:39.480 --> 12:42.480
Stop, look and listen, baby

12:42.480 --> 12:45.480
That's my philosophy

12:45.480 --> 12:49.480
It's called rubbernecking, baby

12:49.480 --> 12:53.480
That's alright with me, yeah

12:53.480 --> 12:55.480
Hey, hey, hey, baby

12:55.480 --> 13:00.480
That's alright with me, yeah

13:30.480 --> 13:58.480
We're going downtown, oh yeah We're going downtown, oh yeah

13:58.480 --> 14:13.400
Don't, don't, don't don't stop the beat Can't, can't, can't control my feet

14:13.400 --> 14:17.400
P-P-P-People in the street Come on everybody move your feet

14:17.400 --> 14:21.320
Don't stop, don't stop the beat I can't stop, can't stop the beat

14:21.320 --> 14:23.520
I won't stop, won't stop the beat no

14:23.520 --> 14:25.520
Let's go!

15:23.520 --> 15:30.520
You were right to make me free

15:30.520 --> 15:38.520
That you're the need to live

15:38.520 --> 15:44.520
You were right to make me free

15:44.520 --> 15:52.520
Never thought you'd come to me

16:52.520 --> 17:00.520
Gaming Radio, so uncensored, that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.

17:00.520 --> 17:02.520
Moo-caw-key.

17:02.520 --> 17:04.520
Orange Lounge Radio.

17:04.520 --> 17:06.520
Pack's done.

17:06.520 --> 17:15.520
Hello everybody, we are back on Orange Lounge Radio, and that break, arguably one of the best remixes ever done for DDR, Midihead, in my eyes.

17:15.520 --> 17:19.160
in my eyes. Before that, Junior Senior, Move Your Feet,

17:19.160 --> 17:23.920
Elvis, Rubberneckin from Ultramix 2, and the Kiryamaoka with Your Rain, The Rage Mix

17:23.920 --> 17:24.400
from

17:24.400 --> 17:29.680
DDR Extreme USA. Remember when it was like a really huge deal because we were

17:29.680 --> 17:30.640
like the first

17:30.640 --> 17:35.280
place that had that song and we played it and like we made everybody wait for

17:35.280 --> 17:37.720
like two and a half hours before we finally played the song.

17:37.720 --> 17:43.400
Which one? The Your Rain, The Rage Mix. Oh yeah. We're hoping we get to do that again this year.

17:43.400 --> 17:46.520
We're actually kind of excited because we think we might have some hookups this year

17:46.520 --> 17:50.480
where we'll get to debut some of the new songs for you guys, so we're very excited about

17:50.480 --> 17:51.480
that.

17:51.480 --> 17:52.480
Yay.

17:52.480 --> 17:56.480
So, anyway, yes we have a lot of E3 to talk about tonight.

17:56.480 --> 18:00.720
Just Loki and I here tonight, DarkSakura has the night off, she's on her way back from

18:00.720 --> 18:01.720
L.A. right now.

18:01.720 --> 18:06.840
Her and some folks from DRFreak went over to Disneyland yesterday, and I was actually

18:06.840 --> 18:11.040
originally going to go with them, but I had to back out at the last minute, basically,

18:11.040 --> 18:15.760
Because I'm in a bit of a financial situation right now so I couldn't afford to go to Disneyland

18:15.760 --> 18:17.200
among some other things going on.

18:17.200 --> 18:18.200
You're better off.

18:18.200 --> 18:19.440
I mean, it's overrated.

18:19.440 --> 18:22.040
Well, I have some good memories from when I was a kid.

18:22.040 --> 18:23.800
So I was like, eh, I kind of want to go to Disneyland.

18:23.800 --> 18:25.000
It'd be cute.

18:25.000 --> 18:28.360
And plus it made my mom really jealous because I told my mom I was going to go to Disneyland.

18:28.360 --> 18:30.360
She was like, I want to go.

18:30.360 --> 18:31.640
What are you going to do?

18:31.640 --> 18:36.520
So I was going to have fun being able to rub that in her face, but I didn't end up going.

18:36.520 --> 18:37.840
So that's all right.

18:37.840 --> 18:38.840
It happens.

18:38.840 --> 18:42.380
had a pretty good time at E3, so I guess that's that.

18:42.380 --> 18:45.140
All right, so how about a little bit of how was your

18:45.140 --> 18:47.700
week, how was your day, except for the fact that we're going

18:47.700 --> 18:50.300
to talk about E3 a little later.

18:50.300 --> 18:53.140
So is there anything you want to share outside of E3 for how

18:53.140 --> 18:54.460
was your week, how was your day, low key?

18:54.460 --> 18:58.220
Well, let's start off with, first off, we

18:58.220 --> 18:58.980
drove down there.

18:58.980 --> 19:01.220
That was eight hours of fun.

19:01.220 --> 19:07.860
And then we got there, and we went and saw the More Friends

19:07.860 --> 19:11.460
concert, and, well...

19:11.460 --> 19:14.220
Yeah, more friends, more music from Final Fantasy.

19:14.220 --> 19:16.460
It was Snap, Crackle, and Poppin' Fun.

19:16.460 --> 19:18.020
That's what it was.

19:18.020 --> 19:21.460
I think that's the best way to describe the concert, was Snap, Crackle, Pop.

19:21.460 --> 19:22.460
That's a good one.

19:22.460 --> 19:23.460
Let's just put it this way, okay?

19:23.460 --> 19:30.060
If you were to have, like, say, they had complete retards working their audio.

19:30.060 --> 19:31.060
That's what it was.

19:31.060 --> 19:34.820
Because, you know, the singers would be singing, you can't hear them, or the mics wouldn't

19:34.820 --> 19:35.820
be turned on.

19:35.820 --> 19:39.780
It's like they honestly like they got some tech guy out of high school to do it

19:40.440 --> 19:44.940
You know, it was awful as far as audio goes. It was cool

19:44.940 --> 19:47.860
You know the black mages were cool and everything

19:47.860 --> 19:51.700
But it just wasn't mixed right and it's just it didn't sound good at all

19:51.700 --> 19:59.180
Like it's especially the end where they like combined the rock band with the orchestra with the choir. It's just drowned out everything

19:59.180 --> 20:01.180
It's just awful

20:01.620 --> 20:03.760
In that sense, but it was a cool concert

20:03.760 --> 20:20.760
And then we went to Arcade Infinity, and I played the tambourine game except it sucked, only because they didn't have the thing on the floor, told you where to stand, so I couldn't tell where the sensors were, so I, you know, kept losing. But I got to play Night of Fire on tambourines, and I looked like a complete dumbass.

20:20.760 --> 20:25.760
Is it just me, or is the tambourine game the gayest game ever made? And I can say that because I am gay.

20:25.760 --> 20:31.840
because I am gay it's exactly like some of the amigo it's just but I mean don't

20:31.840 --> 20:37.880
you look a little bit fruity playing that game I guess I can trust me I

20:37.880 --> 20:41.840
looked over you look pretty fruity playing that game I guess I hey okay I

20:41.840 --> 20:46.040
had played dance maniacs all day I had to get my dance maniacs Phil and after

20:46.040 --> 20:50.360
my hands started hurting from hitting the damn sensors on accident I decided

20:50.360 --> 20:53.400
to just go ahead and play the tambourine game since it was there you know try it

20:53.400 --> 21:00.720
out and no it wasn't good it sucked and this is arcade infinity of course that

21:00.720 --> 21:03.780
has this game and you know a lot of people know arcade infinity because it's

21:03.780 --> 21:08.460
like you know the home of all these import games and it's the babani capital

21:08.460 --> 21:12.980
of the world and stuff is it just me or is arcade infinity slowly losing its

21:12.980 --> 21:17.140
charm a little bit as the years go yeah it's slowly losing its charm I did get

21:17.140 --> 21:21.240
to play some guitar freaks V that was kind of cool and I got to play who was

21:21.240 --> 21:29.240
What was that one song? Well, Misery Lou had played that, and then whatever that heavy metal song that was in that.

21:29.240 --> 21:35.240
The only one I remember I actually really like, I hate to admit this, I really like the Vanilla Ninja song that's in Guitar Freaks. I need to copy it.

21:35.240 --> 21:43.240
I played that too. But anyways, the heavy metal one that was completely obnoxious, I played that about three times. Really loud.

21:43.240 --> 21:48.240
because the guitar freaks there, it's really loud. It's just extremely loud.

21:48.240 --> 21:53.240
It's so unexpected, coming from playing at Golf Land where everything's quiet.

21:53.240 --> 21:59.240
I got to play a little bit of Papa Music Yoha when I was there, and it pissed me off

21:59.240 --> 22:02.240
because when I started the game I just went into, you know, I can't read Japanese,

22:02.240 --> 22:05.240
I don't know what the different modes are, so I just went into the first mode,

22:05.240 --> 22:09.240
the default mode, and it's some type of beginner warm-up mode, so I couldn't pick

22:09.240 --> 22:13.320
pick from hardly any of the songs so I got kind of frustrated I mean I got to

22:13.320 --> 22:17.280
play Gradius full speed in the first game but it was on like easy mode and

22:17.280 --> 22:20.240
you know I'm already decent enough at pop music where I can play a lot of

22:20.240 --> 22:24.800
stuff on hyper so finally I figured out the only way you can really pick from

22:24.800 --> 22:27.080
any song is you have to go into challenge mode but that just kind of

22:27.080 --> 22:30.200
ticked me off that I lost a dollar because I didn't know better I also

22:30.200 --> 22:33.920
played a game of 2d x-red did you play any 2d x-red nope don't play 2d oh well

22:33.920 --> 22:39.040
I it was fun I guess I was able to play injection of love and that made me happy

22:39.040 --> 22:48.300
happy. What else did I play? Nothing, really. They had taken out my GalsPentate game from

22:48.300 --> 22:55.220
AI, so that made me sad. Yeah, really, that was all I played, was dance maniacs and guitar

22:55.220 --> 23:01.440
freaks there. I don't care to touch Poppy Music, just because... I mean, honestly, why

23:01.440 --> 23:07.620
are they making Poppy Music 13? It's the same fucking game all over. It's just, oh, look,

23:07.620 --> 23:12.380
changed it now it's a different theme it's got a game it's got a rabid fan

23:12.380 --> 23:16.400
base and apparently it's still doing very well in Japan so I don't get it

23:16.400 --> 23:22.260
don't know what to tell you I don't get it but yeah so I played that as fun and

23:22.260 --> 23:25.900
then you know of course you know Wednesday Thursday Friday and we

23:25.900 --> 23:31.740
actually did the e3 thing a little bit of highlights though of non e3 stuff we

23:31.740 --> 23:36.500
did fight it okay now get this we fought our way through an audio slave concert

23:36.500 --> 23:43.500
to go to Hooters. Yes, this is true. We fought our way through a concert in the middle of

23:43.500 --> 23:49.840
Hollywood in Highland to go to Hooters to eat. I guess they were taping the Jimmy Kimmel

23:49.840 --> 23:54.840
show or something. All these people were out there because, you know, free Audioslave concert.

23:54.840 --> 23:58.780
And I'm going to be honest, guys, I didn't even know who Audioslave was, really, until

23:58.780 --> 24:03.020
I looked up and the guy was singing Spoon Man and I was like, oh, it's the guy from

24:03.020 --> 24:06.860
Soundgarden he must have like a new band and finally I figured it out I mean how's

24:06.860 --> 24:12.820
that apparently their new album came out that day okay apparently that's what I

24:12.820 --> 24:16.980
read but I get it but yeah so we had to fight our way through a crowd so that we

24:16.980 --> 24:20.660
could go to Hooters because they don't have Hooters in Sacramento so it's a big

24:20.660 --> 24:24.460
deal for us to get to go to Hooters it was who terrific yeah and honestly

24:24.460 --> 24:29.660
what's the big deal with Hooters why are they have a I know we I don't like to

24:29.660 --> 24:32.020
talk about local stuff a lot but they're making a big stink about putting a

24:32.020 --> 24:34.500
Hooters here in Sacramento because they're saying you know it's gonna crap

24:34.500 --> 24:38.300
the children. What's the big deal? I've seen bigger horror waitresses at Chili's

24:38.300 --> 24:42.940
than I saw at Hooters. If you want to talk about a big horror selling burgers, look at

24:42.940 --> 24:49.620
the new Paris Hilton Carl's Jr. commercial. Come on. Is that... and oh man I

24:49.620 --> 24:53.780
can't believe that she's just like... did you know and I'm not sure if you're

24:53.780 --> 24:57.940
aware of this that's actually gonna be on TV and I saw this last night before

24:57.940 --> 25:01.140
they're... you know they have the commercials before the movies and stuff

25:01.140 --> 25:03.140
They were trailering get this

25:03.660 --> 25:05.660
It was I want to be a Hilton

25:05.660 --> 25:12.620
It's gonna be a new reality show where the mother is actually gonna try to eat like it's refined making them refined

25:12.620 --> 25:16.900
I'm like, yeah and like your daughter's really refined refined improper my ass

25:18.020 --> 25:22.460
So, um, yeah, it's gonna be a new reality show coming to TV. That's crap

25:22.460 --> 25:28.380
I wish the Hilton's would just disappear honestly all of them your hotels get affected by aliens

25:28.380 --> 25:33.980
and their hotels are not that good. Actually, I stayed in the Hilton once. It was nice.

25:33.980 --> 25:40.340
But that's because my work paid for it. When I have to pay for it, I stay at Motel 6 in

25:40.340 --> 25:48.260
the ghetto part of Hollywood. We didn't have any run-ins with former reality TV stars this

25:48.260 --> 25:54.660
time at the Motel 6 like we did last year. All the celebrity sightings this year were

25:54.660 --> 26:00.260
from far away. And a culmination of everybody that was in our group, I think we saw Gary

26:00.260 --> 26:08.180
Coleman, Sinbad again. We saw Jason Mewes and the Waynes brothers.

26:08.180 --> 26:10.060
At E3, not at our hotel.

26:10.060 --> 26:17.300
At E3, yeah right, at our hotel, my ass. Although, our hotel is a step up from Jersey.

26:17.300 --> 26:24.020
But that's pretty much all that really happened. It's just not too much exciting stuff, really.

26:24.020 --> 26:31.660
of walking, feet tired. We're on G4 TV. Oh yeah. If you guys haven't heard the podcast

26:31.660 --> 26:37.420
yet, which by the way, we were doing podcasts every day from E3, and you can download this

26:37.420 --> 26:42.400
at www.orangelandradio.com. Click on Orange Island Radio To Go edition. We actually did

26:42.400 --> 26:47.700
live broadcasts Wednesday, Thursday, Friday from E3. And I believe it's Thursday's edition

26:47.700 --> 26:52.060
we talked about this because it happened on Thursday. We're standing in line to get autographs.

26:52.060 --> 26:56.260
Yeah, we're standing in line to get autographs for my dad, okay? It's for my dad.

26:56.260 --> 27:00.360
I, you know, I'm not starstruck or any of that stuff, you know.

27:00.360 --> 27:03.580
It's not a big deal to me, but my dad really loves the

27:03.580 --> 27:07.040
Attack of the Show, because he's loved the screensaver since the beginning, so I thought,

27:07.040 --> 27:10.620
okay, that'll be a nice gift. If only this were, like, last year or something and

27:10.620 --> 27:13.680
Leo Laporte hadn't been fired yet, then I'd be starstruck, but

27:13.680 --> 27:17.600
maybe me too a little bit, maybe me too a little bit. Because Leo's awesome, Leo.

27:17.600 --> 27:24.840
But, anyway, so, yeah, we were waiting in line and they were filming G4TV.com up on

27:24.840 --> 27:29.440
their little, like, platform there, because they were doing a lot of filming at E3, and

27:29.440 --> 27:34.640
so they're filming an episode of that, and they actually were, you know, filming the

27:34.640 --> 27:39.520
line as we were waiting to get in, just for bumpers for the commercials when you come

27:39.520 --> 27:45.840
in, you know, they do a little, you know, talking over the picture and whatnot.

27:45.840 --> 27:50.840
basically they filmed us for quite a long time on that actually it's funny

27:50.840 --> 27:53.600
somebody in the chair room says were you guys in one of the panning shots below

27:53.600 --> 27:59.240
the platform thing yes that was it yeah so we're down there and we're in a

27:59.240 --> 28:04.000
couple of them and I hear Brad and Irene are also in one for another show too

28:04.000 --> 28:08.760
because they were in the live crowd shot or something at the very end so I

28:08.760 --> 28:15.240
don't know but it's interesting I thought it's pretty cool and I slipped

28:15.240 --> 28:22.080
them Kevin and Sarah one of our media samplers while I was there as well so

28:22.080 --> 28:26.360
we're trying to figure out if like he actually listened to it which we kind of

28:26.360 --> 28:29.840
doubt because you know the people probably slip him all sorts of weird

28:29.840 --> 28:33.280
shit and he doesn't you know he didn't care so we're wondering if one of the

28:33.280 --> 28:36.760
interns is listening to it or if one of the bums who found it in the trash out

28:36.760 --> 28:43.000
back ended up listening to it we don't know I don't know whatever but that yeah

28:43.000 --> 28:49.000
Yeah, that was pretty much our E3, I believe. That pretty much sums it up, other than actual E3 stuff.

28:49.000 --> 29:06.000
Yeah. Uh, let's see. What kind of stuff did I do over the week? Pretty much the same thing, because we were pretty much hanging out together all the week, except I haven't had a car the past couple days, which kind of sucks, so I haven't been able to really go anywhere, because my car's getting repaired from the break-in when they stole my stereo a couple weeks ago.

29:06.000 --> 29:11.600
Um, funny E3 stories, I don't really have a whole lot to add to that except for me almost

29:11.600 --> 29:15.460
passing out because I had to wait for 45 minutes to get a damn hamburger and one of those lines

29:15.460 --> 29:21.940
downstairs to, where there's food. Man, E3 is just so freaking crowded and they don't

29:21.940 --> 29:26.840
have enough stuff to handle everybody, it seems like. I wonder if they actually put

29:26.840 --> 29:30.460
a limit on how many people can go to that. They obviously don't. It really seems like

29:30.460 --> 29:31.460
anybody can go.

29:31.460 --> 29:59.460
Pretty much. I mean, Sinbad's in there. I mean, come on, Sinbad? He's not in the industry. Nor is Gary Coleman. Although, I could see maybe that he, you know, would get one of those legacy passes. I don't know if he'd been there. He'd get invites anyways. Gary Coleman, I think, was in a game, like, a couple years ago. It's possible. I don't know. But, I don't know. I think it's just kind of cool to see that they actually have interest in that kind of stuff, though. That's kind of neat.

29:59.460 --> 30:05.960
Where was Elijah Wood? I thought he was this huge gamer because he was on MTV promoting the Xbox 360.

30:05.960 --> 30:09.960
Where was he at E3? That's what I want to know.

30:09.960 --> 30:11.460
I have no idea.

30:11.460 --> 30:20.960
I guess he had better things to do, more important than gaming stuff because he was such a hardcore gamer.

30:20.960 --> 30:25.960
You know, apparently, I don't know if this is just a rumor or what have you,

30:25.960 --> 30:29.000
but one of my friends posted in LiveJournal about this,

30:29.000 --> 30:31.840
that the Xbox 360, because you got me thinking about that,

30:31.840 --> 30:34.460
that you couldn't really see the consoles

30:34.460 --> 30:35.300
at the Microsoft booth.

30:35.300 --> 30:37.540
You couldn't see the consoles at all.

30:37.540 --> 30:39.760
You just saw them running and you saw the controllers,

30:39.760 --> 30:40.920
but you didn't see the actual console.

30:40.920 --> 30:42.440
Yep, the consoles were there.

30:42.440 --> 30:44.880
But no, he said he looked into one,

30:44.880 --> 30:46.720
like he looked into one of the cases,

30:46.720 --> 30:49.440
and he saw a frickin' Power Mac G5 in there.

30:49.440 --> 30:51.800
Not an Xbox 360.

30:51.800 --> 30:54.840
So isn't that ironic if there's some secret Apple

30:54.840 --> 30:59.640
Microsoft teaming up thing. Well, first off, yes, the G5 processors are in there.

30:59.640 --> 31:04.480
Second of all, the test kits look like a G5. And third of all, there were the

31:04.480 --> 31:09.240
actual Xbox 360s there. They were just... it was built... Some of them were there.

31:09.240 --> 31:13.500
Pretty much it was like a... looked like this white kind of pedestal thing, and

31:13.500 --> 31:18.880
then there was a little cutout, and the 360 was in that cutout. But that was it.

31:18.880 --> 31:23.560
But yeah, they were actually there, and it was probably running off of development

31:23.560 --> 31:28.320
kits, which they've had the pictures online for them. They look like G5s. They pretty

31:28.320 --> 31:34.800
much are G5s, but it's because it runs off the same chipset, PowerPC stuff, so.

31:34.800 --> 31:35.800
Crazy.

31:35.800 --> 31:36.800
Yeah.

31:36.800 --> 31:38.720
Did you actually get to play anything for Xbox 360?

31:38.720 --> 31:42.400
No, I watched people play stuff.

31:42.400 --> 31:45.880
I played one game. I played that Top Spin 2, the tennis game.

31:45.880 --> 31:52.000
I watched people play, what was it, Knee for Speed, Most Wanted, and that looked pretty

31:52.000 --> 31:53.000
cool.

31:53.000 --> 31:59.240
I also, what was it, I was watching demos for different things, but it was just like,

31:59.240 --> 32:00.240
it was cool.

32:00.240 --> 32:01.600
I mean, really good graphics.

32:01.600 --> 32:06.280
I did go online, though, and watch the rest of those, pretty much everything that you

32:06.280 --> 32:10.640
would have to wait in line for, for the PS3, and that looks pretty cool.

32:10.640 --> 32:16.920
like the issue of the new Gran Turismo game mock-up, the re-rendered Final Fantasy 7 intro,

32:16.920 --> 32:23.040
the Spider-Man, Doctor Octopus stuff, and just the amount of details on there is pretty

32:23.040 --> 32:24.040
amazing.

32:24.040 --> 32:26.040
That'll be interesting.

32:26.040 --> 32:30.720
Okay, so now that's it for How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day, because I have nothing really

32:30.720 --> 32:35.520
to add to what Loki adds, so let's talk about the music games.

32:35.520 --> 32:38.760
This is honestly the biggest year for Music Games Z3.

32:38.760 --> 32:39.760
Oh yeah.

32:39.760 --> 32:43.880
So, starting off, the big surprise that just blew everybody out of the water, and people

32:43.880 --> 32:49.320
were like, OMG, it's finally happening, Beatmania USA.

32:49.320 --> 32:53.280
Now Loki, I know you're not a really big Beatmania fan, but even you must have been impressed

32:53.280 --> 32:54.280
by this news.

32:54.280 --> 32:55.280
What did you think?

32:55.280 --> 32:59.160
I just thought, ooh, yay, it's Beatmania.

32:59.160 --> 33:01.160
I'm gonna go play DDR now.

33:01.160 --> 33:06.040
No, it was just like, I was hoping there'd be some different songs in there other than

33:06.040 --> 33:09.160
just like really old Konami originals.

33:09.160 --> 33:10.820
But you know, it's the test location stuff.

33:10.820 --> 33:15.260
But it did look pretty good for test location, like, you know, the E3 demo version or whatever.

33:15.260 --> 33:18.460
It looked pretty polished and stuff.

33:18.460 --> 33:21.860
And honestly, I don't know why people judge that as the final product, because it wasn't...

33:21.860 --> 33:27.260
I mean, if anyone remembers UltraMix 2 last year and how much it sucked, oh my God.

33:27.260 --> 33:28.260
But yeah, this...

33:28.260 --> 33:31.260
Yeah, and then UltraMix 2 ends up being one of the best games they ever put out, arguably.

33:31.260 --> 33:35.380
Yeah, it's just, it's mid, you know, it's not even finished yet.

33:35.380 --> 33:37.020
It's just partial.

33:37.020 --> 33:41.900
So it was pretty good for what it was, you know, um, at least the controllers will be

33:41.900 --> 33:43.860
hopefully cheaper to bring in.

33:43.860 --> 33:44.860
That's, I'm sure...

33:44.860 --> 33:46.820
Yeah, that's something where everybody wins.

33:46.820 --> 33:50.360
Even if you're not a fan of BeatMania in the US and you're against the idea and you're

33:50.360 --> 33:54.300
like I don't get the point because I have every Japanese mix anyway, at least you're

33:54.300 --> 33:58.720
gonna win with this because there's gonna be controllers available now in the US.

33:58.720 --> 34:02.220
Of course there's still gonna be people who bitch when they won't release the arcade style

34:02.220 --> 34:03.220
controllers here.

34:03.220 --> 34:06.260
And I heard, I heard that they're gonna be redesigned too.

34:06.260 --> 34:12.060
Yeah, you know, the ones that we played at, at E3, they actually have the new Konami logo on them,

34:12.060 --> 34:15.160
and I don't remember the controller I have having the new Konami logo on it,

34:15.160 --> 34:18.960
but I think it's some type of new pressing of the Japanese controllers,

34:18.960 --> 34:21.960
because they still said on the turntable itself,

34:21.960 --> 34:27.660
I actually have a picture of them that I'm going to be putting in the Orange Launch Radio galleries in the next couple days,

34:27.660 --> 34:31.060
it actually says BeatMania 2DX on the little turntable,

34:31.060 --> 34:33.960
so that makes me, because of the fact that they're not calling it 2DX here,

34:33.960 --> 34:36.720
because there hasn't been a BeatMania 1 technically.

34:36.720 --> 34:40.600
I mean, granted, we had Hip Hop Mania a year ago, but I think they're just overlooking

34:40.600 --> 34:41.600
that.

34:41.600 --> 34:45.420
And also because, you know, obviously, the new modes, it doesn't really need to be 2DX,

34:45.420 --> 34:51.120
because it's kind of BeatMania and 2DX in 1, so, I mean, you don't really need to call

34:51.120 --> 34:52.940
it that, so.

34:52.940 --> 34:56.120
But it looked pretty cool.

34:56.120 --> 35:01.400
As far as, you know, I didn't actually play it, because 1, it's just, you know, there's

35:01.400 --> 35:06.400
a line of people playing it, and two, I'm just not even good at Beatmania, so I said

35:06.400 --> 35:09.820
no, I'm not gonna touch this, but it looked cool.

35:09.820 --> 35:12.800
It was interesting though, because they were actually plugging Beatmania, if you watch

35:12.800 --> 35:16.100
the little trailer, because Konami at their booth, they show trailers for all the games

35:16.100 --> 35:19.540
that are coming out, so you know, you'd have the DDR trailer, and the Beatmania, and the

35:19.540 --> 35:23.980
Castlevania, and the We Are The Winx, We Are The Winx, that trailer as well, those are

35:23.980 --> 35:24.980
all playing.

35:24.980 --> 35:29.020
What's interesting about the Beatmania trailer, is that it actually said, bringing the arcade

35:29.020 --> 35:30.540
experience home.

35:30.540 --> 35:34.380
There were USA cabinets, though. But not for 2DX. There was, remember, Hip-Hop Mania.

35:34.380 --> 35:38.020
Right, there was Hip-Hop Mania, which I thought was kind of weird, because, okay, A, the game

35:38.020 --> 35:42.060
is not being called Hip-Hop Mania, and let me be the first to say, thank God they aren't

35:42.060 --> 35:45.940
calling it Hip-Hop Mania, because I, for one, would have been really disappointed if they

35:45.940 --> 35:47.440
did. Well, they can't call it Hip-Hop Mania just

35:47.440 --> 35:50.980
because it would confuse people. How about the fact that there was no hip-hop

35:50.980 --> 35:56.820
songs in the demo, really? Maybe one. That's a stretch. But most of it's trance and, you

35:56.820 --> 36:00.960
you know, they can't really call it hip hop mania. But it's interesting that they said

36:00.960 --> 36:04.560
in the draft, bringing the arcade experience home, or, you know, bringing the arcade hit

36:04.560 --> 36:08.040
home. Even the announcer guy was saying, hey, it's an arcade hit, and they're bringing it

36:08.040 --> 36:09.040
home.

36:09.040 --> 36:12.200
I heard a rumor, and of course this is just a rumor, and I think it's another fake song

36:12.200 --> 36:18.340
that's floating around the internet, that there was a song that's going to be in Happy

36:18.340 --> 36:23.800
Sky that's going to be in the US one also. And it's a DJ Amuro track.

36:23.800 --> 36:30.720
Yeah, but I listen to the mp3 of it or what it was supposedly and it no it's a fan

36:30.720 --> 36:32.840
It's not even a good fan made one

36:32.840 --> 36:38.760
It was just you know it has piano in it, so I guess that makes it a DJ Murrow track or whatever I can lame

36:38.760 --> 36:39.920
but um

36:39.920 --> 36:44.920
I'm sure they'll do stuff like that because obviously they haven't listened any licensed stuff

36:44.920 --> 36:47.160
And you never know there might be licensed stuff in there

36:48.640 --> 36:53.040
Possibly it's gonna be a little weird for them to get licensed songs in there because the fact that you know an artist is gonna

36:53.040 --> 36:57.840
to have to give up key samples and all this stuff, but it worked in amplitude, so there's

36:57.840 --> 37:00.080
no reason it can't happen because amplitude isn't good stuff.

37:00.080 --> 37:02.480
It worked in amplitude, and I'll see after the figure.

37:02.480 --> 37:06.520
The other thing is they've got a good relationship with a different drum.

37:06.520 --> 37:08.920
I know a few artists on there that probably wouldn't mind doing that.

37:08.920 --> 37:12.440
I would love to see some different drum artists turn up on BeatMeAniI.

37:12.440 --> 37:14.800
Well hey, already you've got ToeJam.

37:14.800 --> 37:16.520
How much you want to bet ToeJam is in the US one?

37:16.520 --> 37:18.440
Because they'll be an easy transplant for you.

37:18.440 --> 37:23.120
It's going to be in a brand new mix, Happy Sky, and you know, it was in already Ultra

37:23.120 --> 37:24.120
Mix 2.

37:24.120 --> 37:26.160
That would be a pretty easy sell, I would think.

37:26.160 --> 37:27.520
Oh, we'll see.

37:27.520 --> 37:32.440
Anyway, you guys, actually on our website, www.orangelandsradio.com, I actually posted

37:32.440 --> 37:37.280
up an E3 preview of BeatMania USA, and there's actually screenshots from the actual game

37:37.280 --> 37:41.640
and everything, so you can check that out, and as part of it, it actually has the song

37:41.640 --> 37:42.640
list.

37:42.640 --> 37:45.640
If you guys want to check out the songs that are going to show up, these were the songs

37:45.640 --> 37:49.580
that were in the demo, but you know, granted that if they're in the demo they're probably

37:49.580 --> 37:54.360
going to end up in the full game, 99% certainty. The seven key songs you're going to see in

37:54.360 --> 38:01.380
BeatMania USA, Dancing into the Night, Nothing Ain't Stoppin', I Was the One, Shining Polaris

38:01.380 --> 38:07.240
and In My Eyes. Now, a lot of people were complaining at E3 because the difficulty level

38:07.240 --> 38:13.080
was very easy. In My Eyes was showing up as a flashing seven, but the note patterns were

38:13.080 --> 38:18.220
something you would see in a beginner note chart. I guarantee you guys this is not the

38:18.220 --> 38:22.120
way the final release is going to be. I guarantee it. It's not going to be like this. You're

38:22.120 --> 38:25.160
going to see the same level of difficulty you see in the Japanese mixes. The reason

38:25.160 --> 38:30.680
why, now this part I'm speculating, the reason why it was done this way, I speculate, is

38:30.680 --> 38:40.380
because you've got people that have never seen this game before at E3. 99% of the people

38:40.380 --> 38:44.740
in attendance at E3 probably never saw this game before. Probably only 1% of the people

38:44.740 --> 38:49.140
in attendance did. So I think it was something probably to make the game very easily accessible

38:49.140 --> 38:54.620
to them. So I don't think people should get too worked up over the fact that the note

38:54.620 --> 39:00.640
patterns were easy. If you look at the screenshots we posted on OrangeLaunchRadio.com, you can

39:00.640 --> 39:07.220
actually see the very first screenshot has a more dense note pattern than anything that

39:07.220 --> 39:11.840
was in the demo now granted it's in light 7 mode but still it's a more me

39:11.840 --> 39:16.120
all the songs on e3 appeared to be a beginner mode so even to have my light

39:16.120 --> 39:19.800
seven no charts in there I think shows you that there's more to come this is a

39:19.800 --> 39:24.400
very very early build just to kind of show off the game I wouldn't take

39:24.400 --> 39:30.040
anything in this too much as gospel you know what I mean exactly so so stop

39:30.040 --> 39:36.500
getting worked up over the fact that you know it's it was an easy mode um let's

39:36.500 --> 39:43.140
Let's see, also if you put the game, now this is where we get something really interesting

39:43.140 --> 39:48.580
and really different from the Japanese releases and I think honestly this is a throw to the

39:48.580 --> 39:49.580
fans.

39:49.580 --> 39:52.280
I don't think this is something they had to do, I think this is something that they did

39:52.280 --> 39:57.620
for the fans is they actually put in five key mode typically in Japan, for those of

39:57.620 --> 40:02.580
you guys that haven't played these games before, in five key mode it's the seven key songs

40:02.580 --> 40:07.700
But they just put the 6th and 7th key on autoplay, so you only have 5 keys.

40:07.700 --> 40:11.140
And the reason why there is a 5 key mode is because the original Beatmania only had a

40:11.140 --> 40:12.140
5 key mode.

40:12.140 --> 40:14.580
It was a 5 key design.

40:14.580 --> 40:18.740
So what they've done for the US release is they're actually putting, when you go into

40:18.740 --> 40:23.420
5 key mode, instead of having 6 and 7 just be autoplay and it's the same list of songs,

40:23.420 --> 40:24.540
no no.

40:24.540 --> 40:32.160
You're actually gonna get a completely different list of 5 key songs from the 5 key games.

40:32.160 --> 40:37.880
So it's kind of a way for us to catch up on what we missed on Japanese 5 key releases.

40:37.880 --> 40:41.320
So really in reality you're getting two games in one.

40:41.320 --> 40:42.320
Kinda.

40:42.320 --> 40:45.440
You see what I mean?

40:45.440 --> 40:51.960
The five key songs that are going to be available in the demo anyway, La Bossa Nova de February,

40:51.960 --> 41:00.440
Overblast, Hunting for You, Metal Gear Solid Main Theme, and Paranoia Max Dirty Mix.

41:00.440 --> 41:05.120
I'm sure they'll have it where you can download or not download, but they'll have more note charts

41:05.120 --> 41:11.440
I'm sure they'll open up in seven key and stuff. So eventually probably everything will be played all over, you know

41:11.440 --> 41:13.600
May have different note charts for you know

41:14.120 --> 41:16.120
Seven and five or something like that

41:16.680 --> 41:18.720
So it'll be interesting. Yeah, so

41:19.800 --> 41:21.940
I'm very excited about this now again

41:21.940 --> 41:26.520
This is a very early build that we saw at e3 the actual release of this game is not coming until

41:26.520 --> 41:32.200
until 2006. So, we do have a little ways to wait. A lot can happen between now and then

41:32.200 --> 41:36.840
as well. From what I'm hearing though, it's going to be early 2006, like first quarter,

41:36.840 --> 41:40.920
but you never know what might happen with these games. It could be first or second,

41:40.920 --> 41:44.880
but I would say you're definitely going to see this game first half of next year coming

41:44.880 --> 41:50.200
out. So, it should be exciting. Now, one thing that it's kind of getting slammed for is that

41:50.200 --> 41:53.760
the early press release on it and the one sheet that was sent to the press about the

41:53.760 --> 41:57.440
the game states that there's going to be 50 songs in the mix.

41:57.440 --> 41:59.840
And people are saying, well, if there's different song lists

41:59.840 --> 42:04.320
for 5-key and 7-key, that means there's going to be 25 songs

42:04.320 --> 42:05.320
in 5-key and 7-key.

42:05.320 --> 42:07.400
That's kind of eh.

42:07.400 --> 42:10.200
And I have to admit, if it's only going to be 25 songs in

42:10.200 --> 42:11.920
7-key mode, that's a little bit eh.

42:11.920 --> 42:15.180
So I'm hoping that maybe, now nobody said it's going to be

42:15.180 --> 42:16.200
split right down the middle.

42:16.200 --> 42:18.040
I think one thing that could be interesting is perhaps

42:18.040 --> 42:21.560
there's only 10 songs in 5-key mode, 40 in 7-key mode.

42:21.560 --> 42:24.060
I think that's something that's kind of feasible.

42:24.060 --> 42:24.940
We'll see what happens.

42:24.940 --> 42:26.260
And I think that might be a little more satisfying.

42:26.260 --> 42:28.160
And also, I mean, it doesn't mean that they're going to be

42:28.160 --> 42:29.100
stuck in those modes.

42:29.100 --> 42:33.260
Like I said, it's not going to take that much effort to make

42:33.260 --> 42:37.340
another note chart for one song that was a five key to

42:37.340 --> 42:37.820
seven key.

42:37.820 --> 42:39.060
I mean, it's not that hard.

42:39.060 --> 42:41.860
It's just a little editing.

42:41.860 --> 42:43.940
So I don't see why that would be a problem.

42:46.860 --> 42:48.860
So anyway, it'll be interesting to see what kind of

42:48.860 --> 42:50.300
songs we get in this game as well.

42:50.300 --> 42:56.300
Obviously the interface is night-style's interface, but we're seeing songs that date, you know, all the way back to early, early mixes.

42:56.300 --> 43:02.300
Shining Polaris is, what, fifth-style? It was on fourth-style consumer. It was a fourth-style consumer track.

43:02.300 --> 43:05.300
So that goes a little ways back, but then you have...

43:05.300 --> 43:06.300
Dirty Mix.

43:06.300 --> 43:10.300
In My Eyes was a little bit, what, fifth-style? I'm having a hard time remembering some of this stuff.

43:10.300 --> 43:11.300
Fourth, I think.

43:11.300 --> 43:12.300
Yeah, oof.

43:12.300 --> 43:19.300
So, we should expect to see songs from a wide variety of the different Konami styles.

43:19.300 --> 43:23.880
What would be very cool though, and I hope they do and I don't know if they're gonna end up doing this or not

43:23.920 --> 43:28.100
But I'm hoping in five key mode we get at least one or two songs

43:28.580 --> 43:35.280
From seventh mix or the final because those mixes were never released in Japan. So if we got some of those songs

43:35.960 --> 43:41.220
That would be very cool. It'd be kind of like a that would be a really nice thing for Konami to do for the US

43:41.220 --> 43:46.980
Audience I think would be to give us like at least one or two songs from seventh mix or the final to show that they care

43:46.980 --> 43:53.460
But we'll see. Let's see what happens. All right. So that's about that on BeatMania

43:53.460 --> 43:59.060
USA. Anything else you want to add on that? No. Okay. So we will take your calls later

43:59.060 --> 44:04.860
over the Skype line if you guys want to talk about BeatMania USA. Pretty nice surprise

44:04.860 --> 44:10.060
though, huh? That was a nice surprise. Let's talk about some of the stuff that was actually

44:10.060 --> 44:16.300
going on at Konami's booth. It wasn't just a bunch of games being, let me take that back.

44:16.300 --> 44:21.860
You have the games being shown, right? You had Ultramix 3 and Extreme 2 and Beatmania.

44:21.860 --> 44:25.780
What some of you folks may not realize is that these games, I'm sorry, Karaoke Revolution

44:25.780 --> 44:32.600
Party as well, these games were the center stage at Konami's booth. They were the featured

44:32.600 --> 44:39.400
games by Konami this year. Yeah. Not only that, they had this huge setup with this light-up

44:39.400 --> 44:44.580
wall and this, they called it Club Revolution and these, these were the centerpiece games

44:44.580 --> 44:46.020
that Konami was featuring this year.

44:46.020 --> 44:48.420
Not only were they featuring the games live on center stage,

44:48.420 --> 44:50.500
they actually hired, this is something a lot of people

44:50.500 --> 44:51.660
haven't talked about on the forum,

44:51.660 --> 44:53.140
so I want to make this very clear.

44:53.140 --> 44:55.760
They actually hired this dance troupe,

44:55.760 --> 44:58.460
this really famous dance troupe called the Groovilloos

44:58.460 --> 45:01.200
to come in and do about 10 shows

45:01.200 --> 45:02.400
throughout the three days of E3,

45:02.400 --> 45:04.520
maybe a little more, 10 to 12 shows,

45:04.520 --> 45:06.800
kind of showing off DDR.

45:06.800 --> 45:09.420
The Groovilloos were famous because they're actually

45:09.420 --> 45:11.580
the shadow dancers in the iPod commercials,

45:11.580 --> 45:13.180
and they've been in a ton of music videos,

45:13.180 --> 45:21.300
And they're also the same people that are motion-captured for the dancers for Ultra

45:21.300 --> 45:22.300
Mix 3.

45:22.300 --> 45:24.500
Yes, they're actually going to be motion-captured dancers.

45:24.500 --> 45:27.740
It's a little unclear which game, because some people were saying Ultra Mix 3, and some

45:27.740 --> 45:28.980
people were saying Extreme 2.

45:28.980 --> 45:32.180
I think it's Ultra Mix 2, I want to say.

45:32.180 --> 45:33.700
You mean Ultra Mix 3?

45:33.700 --> 45:37.740
No, I think they actually started with probably Ultra Mix 2, because if you remember, they

45:37.740 --> 45:42.820
changed the whole, they re-motion-captured everything for Ultra Mix 2, remember?

45:42.820 --> 45:47.700
Well, regardless, one of the new games, maybe both for all we know, has the Groovaleus being

45:47.700 --> 45:51.780
motion-captured on it, so if you like that dancing in the iPod commercial, that's what

45:51.780 --> 45:55.580
Emmy and the new characters, blues and stuff, that's what they're going to look like.

45:55.580 --> 45:57.280
I mean, it's going to be awesome.

45:57.280 --> 46:00.900
So going back to what I was saying, the Groovaleus were doing this little show, and the show

46:00.900 --> 46:05.380
they did, now they didn't just get up there and play DDR, they actually did a freestyle

46:05.380 --> 46:09.580
thing, they didn't actually have the games running, they weren't actually doing their

46:09.580 --> 46:16.020
dancing on DDR, but what I thought was really cool, what they did, they used music from

46:16.020 --> 46:21.140
the various DDR games, and they even did a throwback to Beatmania. They did this thing

46:21.140 --> 46:26.740
with Metal Gear Solid, the mix there that's in Beatmania, and they actually were all dancing

46:26.740 --> 46:30.700
and the guy had his Beatmania controller, like an air guitar, and he was scratching

46:30.700 --> 46:34.700
on it. I know it sounds a little bit cheesy, but trust me, this was very cool, and they

46:34.700 --> 46:37.580
They got huge crowds around Konami's booth.

46:37.580 --> 46:38.940
Huge crowds checking this out.

46:38.940 --> 46:40.200
These people dancing.

46:40.200 --> 46:42.300
And it was really good promotion for the games.

46:42.300 --> 46:46.080
One thing I thought was very interesting is that they highlighted all the games.

46:46.080 --> 46:49.920
So they actually got one of the girls from the Groovilews would sing like Karaoke Revolution

46:49.920 --> 46:50.920
Party.

46:50.920 --> 46:54.220
One of the songs featured in Karaoke Revolution Party is Crazy in Love.

46:54.220 --> 46:56.420
So she actually got up there and started singing from Crazy in Love.

46:56.420 --> 46:59.580
And the other guy also sang, you know, Play That Funky Music White Boy.

46:59.580 --> 47:00.580
That's right.

47:00.580 --> 47:01.580
But this is the thing.

47:01.580 --> 47:03.660
Karaoke Revolution Party is going to have this new mode we'll talk about a little later

47:03.660 --> 47:07.540
called Sing and Dance Mode, where you can sing and dance at the same time, when she

47:07.540 --> 47:11.880
was doing the sing and dance, if you watched her, the dance she was doing lined up with

47:11.880 --> 47:15.840
the arrows. So in a way, even though she wasn't playing the actual game, they actually showed

47:15.840 --> 47:19.980
the video, the Karaoke Revolution Party video, I mean they had it all synced up, and the

47:19.980 --> 47:25.420
dance she was doing was the exact same dance that was on the screen. It was awesome. So,

47:25.420 --> 47:29.980
my point, the reason why I'm telling you all this, those of you folks that said that Konami

47:29.980 --> 47:34.880
does not support their U.S. audience can now officially shut the fuck up.

47:34.880 --> 47:41.880
Seriously, you got served at E3. The Gruvaloos served you. They did. You just

47:42.420 --> 47:49.420
got served. Konami has thrown all of their support by highlighting Karaoke Revolution

47:49.540 --> 47:56.540
Party, DDR, two of them, and now Beatmania, all coming out in the U.S. If you still, after

47:56.540 --> 48:01.540
If you still, after all of this, think that Konami does not support their U.S. audience

48:01.540 --> 48:05.780
when it comes to these music games, nothing is going to satisfy you.

48:05.780 --> 48:06.780
Nothing.

48:06.780 --> 48:09.200
So, honestly, quit.

48:09.200 --> 48:10.660
Just quit.

48:10.660 --> 48:12.560
Nothing they do is going to satisfy you.

48:12.560 --> 48:13.980
Go away.

48:13.980 --> 48:15.300
We don't need to hear from you anymore.

48:15.300 --> 48:16.300
Quit.

48:16.300 --> 48:17.460
Do us all a favor.

48:17.460 --> 48:23.420
Because it is obvious and apparent that Konami obviously invested a lot of money into this

48:23.420 --> 48:29.060
stuff and that they are throwing their full support behind these new games so

48:29.060 --> 48:34.540
so shut up I wanted one of the songs that they were playing there and I don't

48:34.540 --> 48:38.500
know what it is someone told me though that was the music from one of the menus

48:38.500 --> 48:41.580
which is pretty cool yeah actually the very first song the

48:41.580 --> 48:44.820
groove loose did was supposedly some type of stage select music or something

48:44.820 --> 48:49.540
I wanted it because I can remix it with no limit it would work perfect but I

48:49.540 --> 48:53.980
can't find it because it's only in their little dance thing and that makes me sad

48:53.980 --> 49:04.500
but it's alright soon enough but anyways I was gonna say for the um I know we

49:04.500 --> 49:07.660
haven't really touched on this yet extreme 2 and stuff but this is kind of

49:07.660 --> 49:12.900
a little off the topic of Japanese DDR you know we had the little thing where

49:12.900 --> 49:16.100
they're saying you know oh hey it's a new mix of the teaser things you're

49:16.100 --> 49:35.100
It's extreme 2. Now I know everyone is like, well yeah, of course it's extreme 2, but we know this for a fact, because the exact same footage of which they have a still on their website teasing it, the exact same footage was in the intro for DDR extreme 2. So, it's a fact. It's extreme 2 that they're plugging there.

49:35.100 --> 49:45.100
There's obviously other information that we'll cover probably a little bit later in the show regarding Xtreme 2, at least rumors, and that sort of thing.

49:45.100 --> 49:48.100
But anyways, DDR.

49:48.100 --> 49:52.100
Yeah, actually I think we're going to take a break at this point. We're going to come back and do some DDR.

49:52.100 --> 49:58.100
We're going to talk about Xtreme 2, and I think before we come back and talk about Xtreme 2, I'm actually going to play one of the brand new songs from Xtreme 2.

49:58.100 --> 50:01.420
This is a premiere. I don't think anybody else has played this song yet.

50:01.420 --> 50:04.940
So this is a brand new premiere for you guys.

50:04.940 --> 50:09.620
I just have to find it here. Let's see, we're gonna do this.

50:09.620 --> 50:13.940
Also, later in the show, we will talk, we're not gonna just talk about Konami.

50:13.940 --> 50:15.780
There were other music games there at the show.

50:15.780 --> 50:19.220
Yes, I do want to bring you guys up to speed on what's going on within the groove.

50:19.220 --> 50:22.660
Very interesting what went on at Red Octane's booth. Very, very interesting.

50:22.660 --> 50:24.780
So I want to talk about that. And I have played it.

50:24.780 --> 50:28.060
Yeah, and Loki finally got to play in the groove for the first time.

50:28.060 --> 50:31.980
so he has some things he wants to say about In a Groove. We have some

50:31.980 --> 50:35.620
interesting things to say about Guitar Hero, we'll get into that,

50:35.620 --> 50:39.300
and what else? There's other music games there. Actually, I'm gonna tell you guys about a

50:39.300 --> 50:40.060
music game.

50:40.060 --> 50:44.060
I think everybody completely missed because it's on a platform you would have

50:44.060 --> 50:45.100
never expected.

50:45.100 --> 50:48.540
When I was going through my press kits, I discovered this, that there's actually a

50:48.540 --> 50:49.700
brand new music game.

50:49.700 --> 50:54.580
Nobody even noticed, I think. So we're gonna talk about that all when we come back.

50:54.580 --> 50:58.260
For now though, let's get into the song from

50:58.260 --> 51:01.780
EX2. Okay, this is the song. This song is

51:01.780 --> 51:05.740
Naoto Suzuki featuring Martha, and the song is called

51:05.740 --> 51:08.780
and I'm gonna mispronounce this first word here

51:08.780 --> 51:12.340
Polovcian

51:12.340 --> 51:17.380
Dances and Chorus. This is a brand new song that's going to be in DDR Extreme 2.

51:17.380 --> 51:21.100
I actually only have the full mix, so this is about a five minute song, but you

51:21.100 --> 51:23.380
can expect to see about a minute and a half, two minute edit.

51:23.380 --> 51:26.380
This song was in the demo. It had its own video with it.

51:26.380 --> 51:31.380
The deal is, is this is actually from a new game coming out that Konami's putting out called OZ.

51:31.380 --> 51:34.380
And that's really all I know, is that it's some new game that Konami's putting out.

51:34.380 --> 51:35.380
It looks spiffy from the video, though.

51:35.380 --> 51:39.380
The video looked pretty hot. It looks like a Castlevania-ish title-ish.

51:39.380 --> 51:42.380
And it'll be nice to actually hear the music since the bass that they had around there.

51:42.380 --> 51:43.380
Yeah.

51:43.380 --> 51:45.380
It was a little too loud and I couldn't hear it, but yeah.

51:45.380 --> 51:50.380
So here it is, you guys. World premiere for you guys here on Orange Lounge Radio from DDR Extreme 2.

51:50.380 --> 51:56.220
This is the full version of Polovstian, and I'm sorry, I'm totally butchering that word,

51:56.220 --> 51:59.720
Polovstian Dances and Chorus.

51:59.720 --> 52:00.720
We'll be back after this.

52:00.720 --> 52:26.720
🎶🎶🎶

56:00.720 --> 56:01.720
Hey!

56:01.720 --> 56:02.720
Hey!

56:02.720 --> 56:03.720
Hey!

56:03.720 --> 56:04.720
Hey!

56:04.720 --> 56:05.720
Hey!

56:05.720 --> 56:06.720
Hey!

56:36.720 --> 56:38.720
You

57:06.720 --> 57:15.320
Hi-ho, Kermit the Frog here informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio

57:15.320 --> 57:19.240
is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.

57:19.240 --> 57:24.040
Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

57:24.040 --> 57:28.240
Alright, we are back and that was one of the brand new songs from DDR Extreme 2.

57:28.240 --> 57:32.520
The full version there, Palovstian Dances and Chorus.

57:32.520 --> 57:33.840
So should be interesting.

57:33.840 --> 57:36.240
Now remember that's going to be trimmed to DDR length.

57:36.240 --> 57:39.200
So if you guys kind of thought, it's a little bit repetitive there and kind of get slow

57:39.200 --> 57:43.160
in some parts, don't forget they're going to trim it so that it's more DDR friendly.

57:43.160 --> 57:45.960
So you can kind of, you know, the fast parts there with the vocal, that's probably what

57:45.960 --> 57:47.720
you're going to see in the final release.

57:47.720 --> 57:54.020
Honestly, I did play that song in the demo, but it was so darn loud at E3 that I couldn't,

57:54.020 --> 57:55.440
could barely hear the song.

57:55.440 --> 58:00.100
So I couldn't tell you what parts of it specifically are in there, sorry.

58:00.100 --> 58:04.520
So but I do, I do remember it was fun and it had a pretty sweet video, so it's exciting

58:04.520 --> 58:11.540
that they're going to other games other than just Silent Hill for some of their music.

58:11.540 --> 58:15.520
So Konami's tapping into some of their other games. It's kind of cool. And then we'll get

58:15.520 --> 58:19.740
into Ultramix 3, which actually has a song from Castlevania in it, which was originally

58:19.740 --> 58:23.920
in Keyboard Mania. We'll get to that in a little bit. So let's talk about some of the

58:23.920 --> 58:28.540
DDRs. We'll start off with Extreme 2, since we played the song there in that break. We

58:28.540 --> 58:32.600
will open up the Skype line in a little bit here for you guys to call in if you have questions

58:32.600 --> 58:37.600
for us about E3, some other things. Let's talk about Xtreme 2 first off. What did you

58:37.600 --> 58:39.600
think of Xtreme 2? You got a chance to play it, right?

58:39.600 --> 58:44.140
It was cool. I liked it. I'll probably be buying it.

58:44.140 --> 58:48.820
What are some of the differences between Xtreme 2 and Xtreme 1?

58:48.820 --> 58:51.840
First off, the interface went back to the old style.

58:51.840 --> 58:58.000
Yes, now it doesn't, not meaning that it copies Xtreme 1's interface, but that Konami basically

58:58.000 --> 59:03.360
got the hint that you guys didn't like the interface in Xtreme USA, so they've changed

59:03.360 --> 59:05.480
it back to that style of...

59:05.480 --> 59:06.480
The standard song wheel.

59:06.480 --> 59:09.720
Yeah, the song wheel that you guys are familiar with since DDR Max.

59:09.720 --> 59:10.720
Yeah.

59:10.720 --> 59:11.720
So, rest easy.

59:11.720 --> 59:13.120
It's gonna stick with that, so.

59:13.120 --> 59:16.880
A lot more modes in this time.

59:16.880 --> 59:22.520
I actually got to play the Xtreme 2 in two different locations.

59:22.520 --> 59:26.760
The first one being at Konami's booth, which had, you know, free play mode was the only

59:26.760 --> 59:32.600
thing available on it at the moment. I was able to actually play a few songs on there.

59:32.600 --> 59:39.880
I tried playing on, what was it, doubles and stuff, but once again Konami only had soft

59:39.880 --> 59:49.040
pads, so that was no good. And then I got to play again on the Sony Entertainment booth.

59:49.040 --> 59:54.440
I got to play the iToy support, and by the way, there is a new iToy coming out. It looks

59:54.440 --> 01:00:01.280
a lot smaller, looked pretty cool. And I got to try the new Hands and Feet mode, which

01:00:01.280 --> 01:00:09.160
now is available in all difficulties. Unfortunately, it hasn't gotten any better. It just throws

01:00:09.160 --> 01:00:11.320
out hands in random spots.

01:00:11.320 --> 01:00:16.520
Well, now you could get Hands and Feet harder songs in before in Extreme 1, but it was kind

01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:21.800
of a pain to do it. You had to kind of set things weird to get it, but I remember playing

01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:25.480
maximizer like heavy on hands and feets and it was stupid. But I thought hands and feet

01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:29.800
didn't, or if you played it on heavy it did not have the hands. I could swear there was

01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:33.320
a way you could get them in there, it's been so long since I played. But regardless it's

01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:37.640
a lot easier to figure out in Extreme 2, it's more logical the way they have it set up.

01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:40.700
They need to put it in edit mode, that's all I'm saying, that's the only thing they need

01:00:40.700 --> 01:00:46.120
to do and that option will be awesome because if you can do your own hand motions and set

01:00:46.120 --> 01:00:51.320
up, you know, that would be a really incredible thing to do because it'll be a lot of fun.

01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:55.960
I know their hands charts are a little bit on the easy side, all of them being one-footers.

01:00:55.960 --> 01:00:59.340
So yeah, I need a little something harder.

01:00:59.340 --> 01:01:04.220
Now the interesting thing is I actually played in the heat of the night, heavy, over at Sony's

01:01:04.220 --> 01:01:07.400
booth where they had the iToy thing set up because they didn't have the iToy thing set

01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:08.400
up at Konami's booth.

01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:11.480
They weren't really selling the iToy thing.

01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:15.920
In fact, I don't think anybody mentioned the iToy thing at Konami's booth.

01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:19.400
This was something more at Sony's and they were kind of whoring out was the iToy thing.

01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:21.320
and they had it set up in their itoy area.

01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:24.160
The big push for Extreme 2 at Konami's booth

01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:25.680
was the online support.

01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:28.320
So this is definitely not a rumor anymore.

01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:30.440
You will be online with Extreme 2,

01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:32.040
because this is what they were selling,

01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:33.960
is that you're going to be able to do the online mode.

01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:35.600
And then the feature I'm going to do later this week,

01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:38.080
we actually have screenshots from the online mode that'll

01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:41.240
show you kind of what it looks like.

01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:43.480
So over at Sony's booth, I actually

01:01:43.480 --> 01:01:46.320
played in the heat of the night heavy with hands and feet.

01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:48.440
Huge crowd of people watching.

01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:49.160
Did you see that?

01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:52.120
just like tons of people that the reason why I was able to do in the heat of the

01:01:52.120 --> 01:01:55.040
night heavy because it has a very easy step pattern for a heavy song it's a

01:01:55.040 --> 01:01:58.320
very logical seven-footer it's just doo doo doo doo doo doo doo you know do you

01:01:58.320 --> 01:02:01.220
just basically run him back and forth on the pad so it's very easy to do the

01:02:01.220 --> 01:02:04.980
hands you just kind of throw up your hands once in a while people love it I

01:02:04.980 --> 01:02:12.700
tried doing what I did go try doing undo twa on on that and once again Sony

01:02:12.700 --> 01:02:18.360
softpad came to the rescue and failed me and here's why because I was playing

01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:21.920
hands and feet mode and it was pretty hard as it was to coordinate myself to

01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:26.480
do hands on under 12 because it has a really strange step pattern to it and

01:02:26.480 --> 01:02:34.680
then the damn pad stuck to my shoe yay love those soft pads honestly Konami

01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:38.880
needs to make some better hard pads if not I don't care if they're as good as

01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:42.120
the red octane pads but please so they at least have something else that they

01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:48.640
and demo at E3 next year because, God, I hate those soft pads. I hate them. I hate them.

01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:52.880
I hate them. You can't play anything. You fail everything. It sucks. They suck. I don't

01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:59.680
know how I got started on those pads, but they suck. So, give me something better.

01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:04.400
All right. Let's talk about some of the songs that are actually going to be in DDR Extreme

01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:10.780
2. A lot of people very excited that Erotic is finally making its way into a U.S. mix.

01:03:10.780 --> 01:03:14.700
And this is very interesting, just because a lot of people, especially previously, were

01:03:14.700 --> 01:03:17.480
like, you know, well, in the grooves, the only way we're ever going to see erotic songs

01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:18.480
at home.

01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:20.220
And then Konami kind of pulls this one out.

01:03:20.220 --> 01:03:22.540
Oh, nope, we're going to put In the Heat of the Night on there.

01:03:22.540 --> 01:03:24.260
That's kind of interesting.

01:03:24.260 --> 01:03:26.320
I'm not trying to slam one way or the other.

01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:30.060
It's just interesting that the timing, the timing always seems to work out that way,

01:03:30.060 --> 01:03:31.060
right?

01:03:31.060 --> 01:03:32.060
Doesn't it?

01:03:32.060 --> 01:03:35.180
It doesn't always seem like somebody's yelling about something and then Konami says, oh,

01:03:35.180 --> 01:03:36.580
here you go.

01:03:36.580 --> 01:03:37.580
I don't know.

01:03:37.580 --> 01:03:38.580
Exactly.

01:03:38.580 --> 01:03:45.340
Um, let's talk about some of the songs that are going to be in DDR Extreme 2.

01:03:45.340 --> 01:03:47.660
Erotic and Heat of the Night, of course, as we mentioned.

01:03:47.660 --> 01:03:49.660
Genie in a Bottle, but it's a cover of it.

01:03:49.660 --> 01:03:53.100
It's by the NC featuring NRG Factory.

01:03:53.100 --> 01:03:58.420
So I'm wondering if that isn't one of those karaoke revolution crossovers.

01:03:58.420 --> 01:03:59.420
No.

01:03:59.420 --> 01:04:00.420
It really?

01:04:00.420 --> 01:04:05.180
It was kind of a clubby, imagine, you remember how Oops I Did It Again was kind of clubby?

01:04:05.180 --> 01:04:06.180
Yeah.

01:04:06.180 --> 01:04:07.180
It's like that.

01:04:07.180 --> 01:04:08.180
Huh.

01:04:08.180 --> 01:04:12.340
I listened to the, I didn't play it, hell no, I'm not touching that song, but I listened

01:04:12.340 --> 01:04:16.340
to the little, you know, loop that they have there when you're playing, you know, in the

01:04:16.340 --> 01:04:22.040
song selection screen, and it listened, it sounded just like, oops, I did it again.

01:04:22.040 --> 01:04:24.160
So that was kind of cool.

01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:28.980
Sean Paul with Get Busy, now again, I don't listen to a whole lot of mainstream music,

01:04:28.980 --> 01:04:32.620
so I had no idea that this was a pretty big song.

01:04:32.620 --> 01:04:34.740
I really had the video for it.

01:04:34.740 --> 01:04:36.740
Yeah, and the video was in it.

01:04:36.740 --> 01:04:38.960
1998 from Naoki.

01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:42.460
Now, the rest of this song list, a lot of these read-like

01:04:42.460 --> 01:04:43.900
songs that people were complaining

01:04:43.900 --> 01:04:45.660
were in Extreme 1.

01:04:45.660 --> 01:04:49.540
Le More et la Liberté by Naoki Underground.

01:04:49.540 --> 01:04:51.820
Une de Trois, of course, is mentioned.

01:04:51.820 --> 01:04:53.140
And then some other songs as well.

01:04:53.140 --> 01:04:57.520
Can Be Real, Vision F. La Bamba from DDR Extreme, of

01:04:57.520 --> 01:04:58.460
course, showed up there.

01:04:58.460 --> 01:05:00.940
A new song by Sotav called Saturday Night

01:05:00.940 --> 01:05:02.620
Love was in there as well.

01:05:02.620 --> 01:05:03.780
I played that a little bit.

01:05:03.780 --> 01:05:05.220
I didn't quite hear it, though.

01:05:05.220 --> 01:05:06.380
Yeah, it was hard to hear.

01:05:06.380 --> 01:05:09.980
Too loud.

01:05:09.980 --> 01:05:12.380
Tons of characters are going to show up in Xtreme 2 as well.

01:05:12.380 --> 01:05:15.880
Did you see the new character select screen on some of the screenshots that are online?

01:05:15.880 --> 01:05:16.880
Pretty big.

01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:18.540
Crazy amounts of characters in there.

01:05:18.540 --> 01:05:22.100
Rumor is, and I didn't see this and I haven't seen this in the press release either, but

01:05:22.100 --> 01:05:25.140
I was reading in some of the forums, rumor is that it's supposed to have some type of

01:05:25.140 --> 01:05:29.640
like store mode where you earn points and buy things with the points.

01:05:29.640 --> 01:05:36.880
I guess. I mean, that sounds sort of like the mode that they had in Extreme for the

01:05:36.880 --> 01:05:44.700
Japanese one, I think. No, it wasn't Extreme. It was Festival Mix. Remember where you could

01:05:44.700 --> 01:05:49.240
actually customize your characters a little bit? Sounds very similar to that.

01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:52.960
Yeah. In fact, it sounds like a lot of this is actually very similar to, like, we're getting

01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:58.060
kind of like Festival with some new stuff as well.

01:05:58.060 --> 01:06:01.940
One of the screenshots that actually we got in the press kit actually revealed some other

01:06:01.940 --> 01:06:04.300
songs that weren't in the demo.

01:06:04.300 --> 01:06:08.540
And the other songs that weren't actually in the demo were B-Lovin' by D-Crew is going

01:06:08.540 --> 01:06:09.540
to show up in the game as well.

01:06:09.540 --> 01:06:12.180
So you remember B-Lovin' from DDR Extreme.

01:06:12.180 --> 01:06:19.020
And then Yuzo Koshiro featuring Julie Rugard with a song called You Gotta Move It.

01:06:19.020 --> 01:06:21.880
So those songs are going to show up in DDR Extreme as well.

01:06:21.880 --> 01:06:24.460
So it should be interesting.

01:06:24.460 --> 01:06:31.780
DDR Extreme 2 also having a Mission Mode thing in it, or I guess it's like Dance Master Mode,

01:06:31.780 --> 01:06:33.980
where you're kind of like climbing around this tree.

01:06:33.980 --> 01:06:38.540
Again, these are things that were not available in the demo that they had at E3.

01:06:38.540 --> 01:06:41.180
These are just things we're getting off the screenshots that were available in the press

01:06:41.180 --> 01:06:42.180
kit.

01:06:42.180 --> 01:06:48.100
A very souped up version of Mission Mode called Dance Master Mode.

01:06:48.100 --> 01:06:54.180
And then just some, of course, new backgrounds and new screens.

01:06:54.180 --> 01:06:58.100
grading system, it kind of clicks around and makes a little like beep, beep, beep, beep,

01:06:58.100 --> 01:06:59.100
beep.

01:06:59.100 --> 01:07:00.860
When it's scrolling through the different grades, it kind of sounds like the Price is

01:07:00.860 --> 01:07:03.080
Right wheel or something, I don't know.

01:07:03.080 --> 01:07:08.900
And then there's an online play that you, we can see the options on the screenshot,

01:07:08.900 --> 01:07:14.660
head to head, ranking challenge, practice, data options, and logout.

01:07:14.660 --> 01:07:17.860
What's really interesting though about the screenshot, and I don't get this, but at the

01:07:17.860 --> 01:07:25.540
very top it says 32 weeks from beginning 144 minutes until the end. I have no idea

01:07:25.540 --> 01:07:29.420
what that's supposed to mean. That's like how long you've been playing online or

01:07:29.420 --> 01:07:35.260
what that's supposed to mean? Who knows? I don't know. There was, for example, see

01:07:35.260 --> 01:07:39.220
right there, that's the shot. Obviously, you know, we can't... Yeah, I'm actually

01:07:39.220 --> 01:07:43.980
scanning through some of the screen... Whoa! What was that? That was weird, I don't know.

01:07:43.980 --> 01:07:46.660
We're actually scanning through some of the screenshots in the press kit right now and

01:07:46.660 --> 01:07:52.220
you actually can see screens that are in that teaser that was on the Japanese

01:07:52.220 --> 01:07:56.740
site so this is this game for those of you that are interested in what's coming

01:07:56.740 --> 01:07:59.620
next in Japan it's going to be a port of extreme 2 as if you couldn't figure that

01:07:59.620 --> 01:08:06.100
out already yeah and I just wanted to point something out here too and I heard

01:08:06.100 --> 01:08:10.660
this and I have to see it in my screenshots there but apparently in one

01:08:10.660 --> 01:08:17.460
the backgrounds here we have a familiar little background I'm trying to find it

01:08:17.460 --> 01:08:20.900
here thank God they didn't have the pictures of those people dancing with

01:08:20.900 --> 01:08:23.820
the eye toy like they did last year and you've gone through all the pictures now

01:08:23.820 --> 01:08:28.900
okay wait wait apparently and I didn't see this but apparently someone saw like

01:08:28.900 --> 01:08:32.780
a video that was on a website or whatever it had the familiar dancing

01:08:32.780 --> 01:08:40.380
bears you know those familiar dancing bears from Romeo and Juliet oh yeah and

01:08:40.380 --> 01:08:42.380
and someone thought that that song might be in there.

01:08:42.380 --> 01:08:43.180
I hope not, because that's awesome.

01:08:43.180 --> 01:08:46.180
But I think, weren't they in the video to be lovin'?

01:08:46.180 --> 01:08:49.340
I think they were, so I think people are smoking crack,

01:08:49.340 --> 01:08:50.780
but you know, whatever.

01:08:50.780 --> 01:08:52.340
We'll see, we'll see.

01:08:52.340 --> 01:08:54.580
All right, so that's going to do it

01:08:54.580 --> 01:08:56.060
for us talking about Xtreme 2.

01:08:56.060 --> 01:08:59.140
Let's move on to talking about the other dance game.

01:08:59.140 --> 01:09:01.620
Oh, and I'd like to mention, their Xtreme 2

01:09:01.620 --> 01:09:03.260
logo does look very nice.

01:09:03.260 --> 01:09:05.380
It does.

01:09:05.380 --> 01:09:06.940
I was very disappointed it wasn't purple.

01:09:06.940 --> 01:09:08.220
Yeah, you didn't get your purple interface.

01:09:08.220 --> 01:09:09.300
It's a very bluish green.

01:09:09.300 --> 01:09:12.740
It was, yeah, it was, it looked nice, though.

01:09:12.740 --> 01:09:14.220
All right, let's move on to talk about the other

01:09:14.220 --> 01:09:15.900
dancing game Konami was showing off.

01:09:15.900 --> 01:09:18.800
They were not showing DDR with Mario at Konami's booth,

01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:20.180
by the way, but we will get into that.

01:09:20.180 --> 01:09:22.580
They like to disavow all knowledge of DDR with Mario.

01:09:22.580 --> 01:09:24.940
It's DDR Mario Mix is actually what they're calling it,

01:09:24.940 --> 01:09:27.380
and it didn't show up until you actually walked over

01:09:27.380 --> 01:09:28.520
to Nintendo's booth.

01:09:28.520 --> 01:09:30.380
In fact, I have kind of a funny story.

01:09:30.380 --> 01:09:31.260
We'll get into that a little bit,

01:09:31.260 --> 01:09:33.400
but let's talk Ultra Mix 3.

01:09:33.400 --> 01:09:35.380
What'd you think of Ultra Mix 3, Loki?

01:09:35.380 --> 01:09:36.220
That was cool.

01:09:36.220 --> 01:09:37.740
I liked it, I played it.

01:09:37.740 --> 01:09:43.780
It was interesting, did a lot of weird things with it, all of which we'll mention.

01:09:43.780 --> 01:09:47.860
The first thing I noticed, obviously the interface hasn't really changed much, it is now kind

01:09:47.860 --> 01:09:48.860
of an aqua theme.

01:09:48.860 --> 01:09:49.860
Yeah, it's like water.

01:09:49.860 --> 01:09:51.260
But that's cool, though.

01:09:51.260 --> 01:09:54.420
That's cool because it's not some generic, like, woo, look, it's background videos.

01:09:54.420 --> 01:09:57.340
No, this is all, like, you know, actually water themed.

01:09:57.340 --> 01:09:59.660
It looked pretty cool.

01:09:59.660 --> 01:10:00.940
Good song list so far.

01:10:00.940 --> 01:10:07.540
Again, an early, early build because a lot of stuff changed from UltraMix II's E3 show.

01:10:07.540 --> 01:10:10.580
Remember guys, Ultramix 2 at last year's E3 sucked.

01:10:10.580 --> 01:10:14.180
We dogged on it and said it was going to be a horrible mix, and it turns out it was one

01:10:14.180 --> 01:10:15.940
of the best mixes they ever released.

01:10:15.940 --> 01:10:22.180
The preview for Ultramix 3 this year was actually really kick-ass, and so it's amazing to think

01:10:22.180 --> 01:10:24.620
what this is going to become when it's actually released.

01:10:24.620 --> 01:10:28.220
But if there's a lot of negative feedback to the Aqua theme or some of the characters,

01:10:28.220 --> 01:10:29.780
this stuff could change.

01:10:29.780 --> 01:10:32.100
But there was no Hoochie Mama Emmy this time to speak of.

01:10:32.100 --> 01:10:34.380
In fact, it looks like the characters are actually different, some of them.

01:10:34.380 --> 01:10:38.460
disappointments I had the character select you can only select characters

01:10:38.460 --> 01:10:43.220
with L and R can't do that on a pad so you're stuck with the default character

01:10:43.220 --> 01:10:50.100
interesting then what else there was some pretty cool new songs that were on

01:10:50.100 --> 01:10:54.140
there we have a new MIDI head remix that was in there yes and we're gonna

01:10:54.140 --> 01:10:57.140
actually play that very soon MIDI head is going to do a new remix it's called

01:10:57.140 --> 01:11:03.500
jelly kiss MIDI heads smack mix also in UltraMix 3 we're gonna have Akumajo

01:11:03.500 --> 01:11:08.060
Dracula medley that is the Castlevania songs compilation that is in keyboard

01:11:08.060 --> 01:11:13.140
mania is crossing over I have been begging for this song for two years and

01:11:13.140 --> 01:11:17.100
it's finally there I would like to think that I am directly responsible for the

01:11:17.100 --> 01:11:20.020
song being in there but I'll just keep and for all you people that were

01:11:20.020 --> 01:11:25.760
bitching and moaning before yes you're damn stupid max ripoff song Sakura is in

01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:29.260
there yeah Sakura is showing up in ultra mix 3 which has a lot of people bitching

01:11:29.260 --> 01:11:32.980
that it's not showing up in Xtreme 2 yet, but a lot can change.

01:11:32.980 --> 01:11:38.340
God, people, are you never happy? Honestly, that song is just a stupid Max remix. I mean,

01:11:38.340 --> 01:11:44.420
come on, folks. Just, you know, just because it's in UltraMix 3 does not mean it's not

01:11:44.420 --> 01:11:48.660
gonna show up in Xtreme 2. We just don't know yet. It's a limited song list. Another song

01:11:48.660 --> 01:11:53.020
people have been bitching about for forever, finally coming to the USA after years and

01:11:53.020 --> 01:11:56.060
years, Butterfly, Smile DK.

01:11:56.060 --> 01:12:00.060
I had to laugh, that was funny, cause um, oh god, I can't remember.

01:12:00.060 --> 01:12:02.060
Didn't people say, oh smile decay hates Konami now?

01:12:02.060 --> 01:12:05.060
Who was that freestyling Kyle Snyder's routine?

01:12:05.060 --> 01:12:06.060
Lil B.

01:12:06.060 --> 01:12:09.060
Lil B, yeah he was up there, that was funny.

01:12:09.060 --> 01:12:11.060
So Butterfly is going to be in UltraMix 3.

01:12:11.060 --> 01:12:13.060
Finally, like how many home releases is this later?

01:12:13.060 --> 01:12:15.060
Eleven home mixes later or something?

01:12:15.060 --> 01:12:16.060
We get Butterfly.

01:12:16.060 --> 01:12:18.060
Uh, Breakdown would be for you.

01:12:18.060 --> 01:12:21.060
Togo featuring Sana Miracle Moon, LED light style.

01:12:21.060 --> 01:12:23.060
Daikonkai is going to show up.

01:12:23.060 --> 01:12:25.060
You guys love to whore that song out.

01:12:25.060 --> 01:12:33.520
Firefly, Be For You, Destiny Lovers, The Legend of Max, Emotion, Kiss Me All Night Long, Eversnow,

01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:34.860
and Candy Star.

01:12:34.860 --> 01:12:39.140
Pretty impressive song list so far, lots of songs playable in the UltraMix 3 demo.

01:12:39.140 --> 01:12:43.260
Other things different about UltraMix, there was a brand new freestyle mode.

01:12:43.260 --> 01:12:45.340
Yeah, kind of interesting.

01:12:45.340 --> 01:12:46.760
I got to play that.

01:12:46.760 --> 01:12:47.760
It was very interesting.

01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:52.700
Basically, there are no arrows, but the way it works is, it's even kind of very strange.

01:12:52.700 --> 01:12:55.640
kind of got this thing on the bottom of the screen it looks like kind of like a

01:12:55.640 --> 01:13:00.000
heart meter and it's going across and there's a line in the middle line is

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:05.400
basically on the quarter note for every you know beat so basically what you need

01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:11.000
to do the object of that is I guess I don't know how they grade you on it but

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:16.120
you basically it's like variety and like how fast you step and stuff and

01:13:16.120 --> 01:13:21.760
basically how in like tune with the song you're stepping and stuff and they grade

01:13:21.760 --> 01:13:28.300
you on like variety or like it's like intensity and stuff like that and they

01:13:28.300 --> 01:13:31.660
give you a grading at the end but you basically can do whatever you want and

01:13:31.660 --> 01:13:35.420
you get this like and if you count your calories as you burn yeah so it's very

01:13:35.420 --> 01:13:39.260
interesting it's gonna be a very neat kind of addition like it sounds sounded

01:13:39.260 --> 01:13:43.580
kind of lame it's like oh it's like you know why don't you try some hold notes

01:13:43.580 --> 01:13:47.100
or something like that and it was very strange that was something new that was

01:13:47.100 --> 01:13:53.340
in there. And then the brand new thing, which is really strange, quest mode. Quest mode

01:13:53.340 --> 01:13:59.180
is more interesting than I thought it would be. Quest mode actually seems very similar

01:13:59.180 --> 01:14:04.900
to the mission mode that's showing up in Xtreme 2, except instead of just this giant tree,

01:14:04.900 --> 01:14:10.020
you have this states and capitals map. So you have a map of the states of the union

01:14:10.020 --> 01:14:15.300
with all the various capitals, and you start quest mode in Orange Lounge's home of Sacramento.

01:14:15.300 --> 01:14:18.400
Thank you very much. And that was done for us, by the way. No, I'm kidding.

01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:21.760
And what's also great about that is you have to pick up your

01:14:21.760 --> 01:14:25.980
dance crew, I guess, along the way. I only played a little bit of quest mode and I didn't

01:14:25.980 --> 01:14:28.560
really... it looked like you had to earn a certain amount of points to

01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:32.760
capture a state or something. It looked a little cheesy, but

01:14:32.760 --> 01:14:37.040
you know, it adds some replay value to UltraMix 3. What the heck, right? And it'll

01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:39.240
probably be a method to unlock some new songs.

01:14:39.240 --> 01:14:42.480
Hey, it's creative. Why not, huh? It's not bad.

01:14:42.480 --> 01:14:45.040
It's not bad. It's not as cheesy as you would think.

01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:46.720
It's pretty cool.

01:14:46.720 --> 01:14:50.080
So if you live in a state capital, you'll be able to play in your

01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:54.880
home ground on the quest mode in UltraMix 3.

01:14:54.880 --> 01:14:57.880
Let's get into this. We actually have

01:14:57.880 --> 01:15:01.080
a E3 bootleg exclusive,

01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:06.200
and you know this is Loki's fault. Loki, what did you do here? I recorded the MIDI Head

01:15:06.200 --> 01:15:07.680
remix with

01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:11.200
this really crappy mic and a really crappy digital

01:15:11.200 --> 01:15:12.760
recorder that I have

01:15:12.760 --> 01:15:16.760
and therefore you get this really crappy quality recording

01:15:16.760 --> 01:15:20.160
but it's the only one you're going to hear unless you were there

01:15:20.160 --> 01:15:23.640
and we have to preface this, the reason why we had to record this for you guys is

01:15:23.640 --> 01:15:25.200
the Jelly Kiss remix

01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:26.400
is very hot

01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:29.160
it is very hot, it is

01:15:29.160 --> 01:15:33.000
incredible at his remixes, he's so good at remixing the songs

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:36.920
I played this song about twenty five times while I was there

01:15:36.920 --> 01:15:38.200
so um...

01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:41.160
honestly I wish I had a better mix for you

01:15:41.160 --> 01:15:44.920
because this doesn't do it justice but it's still hot. This will just have to

01:15:44.920 --> 01:15:46.920
kind of at least you can get an idea but

01:15:46.920 --> 01:15:51.060
trust me, guys, this is a very crappy quality. This is like crappy

01:15:51.060 --> 01:15:52.920
location test quality, okay?

01:15:52.920 --> 01:15:58.180
This is like Beatmania 2DX test location

01:15:58.180 --> 01:16:02.440
with a microphone, okay? At least I actually had a microphone and then just used the

01:16:02.440 --> 01:16:04.400
microphone on the tape recorder

01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:07.840
because that would have sucked even worse. Let's see how bad this is because I haven't heard how bad the

01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:11.600
quality though it's pretty bad all right well let's see well I might have to cut

01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:15.200
this off if it's too bad I don't come on you got all right all right a minute like

01:16:15.200 --> 01:16:18.560
fine it's a minute 47 seconds if you don't like the quality you just turn

01:16:18.560 --> 01:16:22.120
down your speakers but trust me you guys this song is so hot

01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:25.580
Jelly Kiss, Midi Head, Smack Mix, bootleg version

01:16:25.580 --> 01:16:27.580
Orange launch radio exclusive

01:17:55.580 --> 01:17:57.580
It's all in here!

01:18:12.920 --> 01:18:16.360
Honestly guys, that recording doesn't do the song justice,

01:18:16.360 --> 01:18:19.940
But you could hear you could hear that the remix is really good

01:18:19.960 --> 01:18:22.480
You could at least get an idea of what it sounds like.

01:18:22.480 --> 01:18:29.220
It's not great, but you know, I tried the best I could to clean that up and it just was not yet doing me any good

01:18:29.220 --> 01:18:32.820
Please don't base your opinion of that song off that recording

01:18:32.820 --> 01:18:38.160
but at least that's really for the hardcore fans to wet your appetite a little bit for the real thing gives you an idea of what's

01:18:38.160 --> 01:18:43.460
Gonna sound like and it sounded really cool when I heard it. I was like, ah, I gotta play this so it'll be cool

01:18:43.460 --> 01:18:45.540
I don't doubt it. But uh

01:18:45.540 --> 01:18:51.180
again guys it was like what a $20 digital recorder how much was like a

01:18:51.180 --> 01:18:55.900
little cheap digital digital recorder was a little bit more than $20 but

01:18:55.900 --> 01:19:00.100
wasn't much but yeah the mic was like ten bucks I mean come on oh yeah the

01:19:00.100 --> 01:19:03.860
mic oh gosh it was that same microphone we use for our podcasts away from home

01:19:03.860 --> 01:19:08.460
$10 mic see like if I had professional recording equipment actually what I

01:19:08.460 --> 01:19:12.580
would have preferred to do but obviously I had no access to do this would be to

01:19:12.580 --> 01:19:17.020
pull one of the audio connectors out of the speaker and actually hook it up directly to

01:19:17.020 --> 01:19:22.820
it. Ideally, you know, if I had known somebody that worked there that would let me do that,

01:19:22.820 --> 01:19:27.620
that'd be awesome, because I would have had the tools to do that. But yeah, right, like

01:19:27.620 --> 01:19:30.460
they're actually going to let me bootleg this song.

01:19:30.460 --> 01:19:34.220
What you did was crazy enough. I couldn't believe, because there was a Konami person

01:19:34.220 --> 01:19:38.340
that walked right by you as you were doing that. I couldn't believe that they were cool

01:19:38.340 --> 01:19:40.020
with it. I not only did that once, I did that twice,

01:19:40.020 --> 01:19:46.300
Because the first time, somehow my erase button got stuck down, so it got erased the first

01:19:46.300 --> 01:19:47.300
time.

01:19:47.300 --> 01:19:50.960
And I did that, the first time was on the stage, I did that right there.

01:19:50.960 --> 01:19:58.220
So no one really cared, but I really wish I had a plug that could have just gotten a

01:19:58.220 --> 01:20:00.220
game copy of it.

01:20:00.220 --> 01:20:04.100
Some folks in the chat room are begging us to put that bootleg copy up somewhere.

01:20:04.100 --> 01:20:09.460
I'll have to think about it, because I really don't want people to think that this is what

01:20:09.460 --> 01:20:14.340
the song is actually going to sound like because it will be much better. Hopefully, Midihead,

01:20:14.340 --> 01:20:17.860
he likes to put these things up on his site. Hopefully, he'll do something for the fans

01:20:17.860 --> 01:20:18.860
over there.

01:20:18.860 --> 01:20:19.860
We'll beg.

01:20:19.860 --> 01:20:23.580
We'll say, we'll beg and plead. Everybody go to Midihead's site and beg and plead. But

01:20:23.580 --> 01:20:26.780
he might not be able to. Don't beg too much, because if he says he can't, then he can't.

01:20:26.780 --> 01:20:30.540
I mean, Konami might be wanting to put this on a V-Rare later or something, so.

01:20:30.540 --> 01:20:32.340
Oh, it will be on a V-Rare, I'm sure.

01:20:32.340 --> 01:20:37.020
He might not be able to do it, so don't bug him too much. If he says no, leave him alone.

01:20:37.020 --> 01:20:39.500
But if there's even a possibility, he might do it.

01:20:39.500 --> 01:20:42.340
Bug him.

01:20:42.340 --> 01:20:44.420
All right.

01:20:44.420 --> 01:20:45.460
Let's go to a break.

01:20:45.460 --> 01:20:47.580
Let's do a break, because we need to stretch a

01:20:47.580 --> 01:20:49.380
little bit here.

01:20:49.380 --> 01:20:51.180
Just a rundown of the different modes that are going

01:20:51.180 --> 01:20:53.300
to be in UltraMix 3 as well before we get a break.

01:20:53.300 --> 01:20:56.980
Party mode, freestyle, quest mode, workout mode, challenge

01:20:56.980 --> 01:21:00.820
mode, playing online, Xbox Live, training mode, edit mode,

01:21:00.820 --> 01:21:02.700
jukebox mode, which is something we didn't mention,

01:21:02.700 --> 01:21:03.940
but it wasn't playable in the demo.

01:21:03.940 --> 01:21:04.440
That's why.

01:21:04.440 --> 01:21:07.720
But we imagine it's just the videos and nothing else.

01:21:07.720 --> 01:21:09.440
Kind of like 2Box Mode and 2DX.

01:21:09.440 --> 01:21:11.960
And options, of course.

01:21:11.960 --> 01:21:14.600
I love playing the options mode.

01:21:14.600 --> 01:21:15.780
We're going to go to a break.

01:21:15.780 --> 01:21:18.280
And when we come back from this break, what we're going to do

01:21:18.280 --> 01:21:20.880
is we're going to talk a little bit about DDR with Mario, or

01:21:20.880 --> 01:21:23.240
DDR Mario Mix, as they're going to call it in the US.

01:21:23.240 --> 01:21:24.560
We're going to talk about In the Groove.

01:21:24.560 --> 01:21:26.800
I still want to talk In the Groove.

01:21:26.800 --> 01:21:28.800
And we want to get Loki's thoughts on

01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:30.200
In the Groove as well.

01:21:30.200 --> 01:21:32.520
And we're going to take your call from Step Line.

01:21:32.520 --> 01:21:37.520
Also, Loki tries a bunch of different hardpads in succession, making him very tired.

01:21:37.520 --> 01:21:42.520
Alright, yeah, yeah, that's, oh yeah, we gotta talk about that. Some of the other

01:21:42.520 --> 01:21:46.520
Kenshiya Hall tour that we did, little Kenshiya Hall tour that we did.

01:21:46.520 --> 01:21:52.520
And, yeah, I want to also touch on how I almost got in trouble a few times at the

01:21:52.520 --> 01:21:58.520
Infinity Gaming booth with their Feel 3.

01:21:58.520 --> 01:22:02.760
we'll talk about that. So in this break I thought what we could do is actually do

01:22:02.760 --> 01:22:05.960
some music from UltraMix 3 because we actually have a lot of the songs

01:22:05.960 --> 01:22:11.000
already in rotation on Orange Lounge Radio, our music program that runs 24

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.320
hours a day seven days a week, we're not here, so we're gonna play some of the

01:22:13.320 --> 01:22:15.880
songs that are gonna be featured in UltraMix 3 in case you guys haven't

01:22:15.880 --> 01:22:20.440
heard them yet. And should we also mention that one of our cast members is

01:22:20.440 --> 01:22:26.160
no longer with us? Yes, we should mention this, one of our cast members is no

01:22:26.160 --> 01:22:31.120
longer with the show they are they have been snatched up by the katamari yes

01:22:31.120 --> 01:22:35.560
they have been stuck on the giant katamari and gone forever and that is

01:22:35.560 --> 01:22:40.480
one of our ferrets and it's actually the ferret in question is the ferret that

01:22:40.480 --> 01:22:45.320
was broken and Loki actually operated on him it was one of the ones I operated on

01:22:45.320 --> 01:22:49.080
and it's also one of the ones that it's one of Jamie's favorites the one it's

01:22:49.080 --> 01:22:54.500
all you know it's all which made me even happier to get rid of it sorry Jamie if

01:22:54.500 --> 01:22:57.980
So now we have old ferrets still here, but the new ferret.

01:22:57.980 --> 01:23:02.680
We still do have one of the ferrets here, and this is Jamie's absolute favorite ferret.

01:23:02.680 --> 01:23:04.260
So he's still here.

01:23:04.260 --> 01:23:07.620
Hmm, actually that might be the old one, or the new one.

01:23:07.620 --> 01:23:09.060
Isn't this the old school ferret?

01:23:09.060 --> 01:23:10.060
I thought that was the new one.

01:23:10.060 --> 01:23:11.060
Was that the very first ferret?

01:23:11.060 --> 01:23:12.060
I don't remember.

01:23:12.060 --> 01:23:14.060
Yeah, that might be the old one.

01:23:14.060 --> 01:23:15.060
I think it is.

01:23:15.060 --> 01:23:16.060
Whatever.

01:23:16.060 --> 01:23:17.060
All right.

01:23:17.060 --> 01:23:18.060
So one of the ferrets is gone.

01:23:18.060 --> 01:23:20.060
I like our chat room.

01:23:20.060 --> 01:23:21.620

01:23:21.620 --> 01:23:23.500

01:24:13.380 --> 01:24:13.880

01:24:13.880 --> 01:24:14.380

01:24:14.380 --> 01:24:14.880

01:24:14.880 --> 01:24:15.380

01:24:15.380 --> 01:24:15.880

01:24:17.880 --> 01:24:18.380
22

01:24:18.380 --> 01:24:18.880
23

01:24:18.880 --> 01:24:19.380
24

01:24:19.380 --> 01:24:19.880

01:24:37.380 --> 01:24:39.380
Yeah

01:25:37.380 --> 01:26:00.900
🎵

01:28:07.380 --> 01:28:09.380
Oh

01:29:07.380 --> 01:29:25.380
Music

01:29:37.380 --> 01:29:44.380
Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

01:30:07.380 --> 01:30:12.460
to play it just because, I don't know, it just wasn't my thing. You know, it looked

01:30:12.460 --> 01:30:18.780
a little easy. It looked kind of very Disney-ravish, and I just didn't want to touch it. But it

01:30:18.780 --> 01:30:24.340
looked interesting, different. This is the thing about DDR Mario Mix. They actually weren't

01:30:24.340 --> 01:30:27.620
showing this at Konami's booth. You actually had to go over to Nintendo's booth to see

01:30:27.620 --> 01:30:32.580
this. And what's really interesting is I asked somebody at Konami's booth, who I know kind

01:30:32.580 --> 01:30:36.940
of well, what's up with DDR with Mario? And they were like, oh, it's a Japanese-only release.

01:30:36.940 --> 01:30:41.260
I'm like, okay. Then I walk over to Nintendo's booth and there it is. They're showing it.

01:30:41.260 --> 01:30:44.060
I'm like, you lied to me. Too many people lied to me this E3.

01:30:44.060 --> 01:30:45.540
You're a dirty liar.

01:30:45.540 --> 01:30:54.540
Too many dirty liars at E3. But we actually went over to the Nintendo booth and ended

01:30:54.540 --> 01:30:58.420
up seeing DDR with Mario. And I actually got to play, and this is the weird thing about

01:30:58.420 --> 01:31:02.280
DDR with Mario. I played a song, I want to say it was like the Hammer Brothers medley

01:31:02.280 --> 01:31:06.340
or something, it was a song I played. It's so loud at E3 you can't hear the song anyway.

01:31:06.340 --> 01:31:10.900
played it and I played it on very hard mode which is only one step below the

01:31:10.900 --> 01:31:15.340
hardest mode that's in there super hard I played it on very hard and not every

01:31:15.340 --> 01:31:18.820
song even has super hard steps in fact very hard was as high as the hammer

01:31:18.820 --> 01:31:22.940
brothers song went I would say it was about the equivalent of a five-footer

01:31:22.940 --> 01:31:29.980
and I triple-a'd it my first try hmm so that's about the skill level you're

01:31:29.980 --> 01:31:34.020
gonna see on DDR Mario mix okay and I'm not one of those people that can like

01:31:34.020 --> 01:31:40.580
AAA every song, okay? I've AAA'd some songs, but nothing that crazy. So DDR Mario

01:31:40.580 --> 01:31:46.880
mix is definitely not for the hardcore DDR player, unless you happen to be a fan

01:31:46.880 --> 01:31:50.740
of Mario as well. Then, you know, then you might like this mix because it's gonna

01:31:50.740 --> 01:31:56.860
have a lot of songs especially for you in this. But as far as, you know, the DDR

01:31:56.860 --> 01:32:00.460
person that's looking for the next 10 footer and is hoping that it's gonna be

01:32:00.460 --> 01:32:04.740
the, you know, star medley in Mario is going to be a 10-footer, I highly doubt it.

01:32:04.740 --> 01:32:07.020
This is a mix that's going to be for kids, mostly.

01:32:07.020 --> 01:32:08.020
Yeah.

01:32:08.020 --> 01:32:09.020
Yeah.

01:32:09.020 --> 01:32:15.100
Um, let's look at, um, some of the songs that are going to be in Dance Dance Revolution

01:32:15.100 --> 01:32:16.100
with Mario.

01:32:16.100 --> 01:32:19.500
It was really, did you actually take a look at the song list at all?

01:32:19.500 --> 01:32:23.500
Um, a little bit, not, very briefly.

01:32:23.500 --> 01:32:26.820
But did you see any songs in there that weren't from a Mario game?

01:32:26.820 --> 01:32:27.820
No.

01:32:27.820 --> 01:32:31.560
DDR Mario mix but with Nintendo putting this out you would still think you'd get

01:32:31.560 --> 01:32:38.340
maybe I don't know a Donkey Kong song or a Zelda song or something no all Mario

01:32:38.340 --> 01:32:44.340
songs starring Wario boo boogie rollercoasting hammer dance blooper bop

01:32:44.340 --> 01:32:49.300
in the whirlpool fishing frenzy jump jump jump destruction dance garden boogie

01:32:49.300 --> 01:32:54.420
underground Mozart here we go up down left right always smiling rendezvous on

01:32:54.420 --> 01:33:01.220
Ice, Deep Freeze, Cabin Freezer, Cabin Fever, and Frozen Pipes are the songs in

01:33:01.220 --> 01:33:07.260
Dance Mystery Revolution of Mario. Also should be noted about DDR Mario mix, only

01:33:07.260 --> 01:33:10.780
going to be like 30 songs at most. It's not going to be a very big mix at all.

01:33:10.780 --> 01:33:16.860
Yeah. So this is, this is something you're gonna get for your five or seven year

01:33:16.860 --> 01:33:21.380
old cousin that wants to get into DDR. Unless you are a Nintendo addict, a

01:33:21.380 --> 01:33:23.940
Nintendo junkie, there's nothing wrong with that. I love Nintendo. You know what,

01:33:23.940 --> 01:33:25.940
This is not for you.

01:33:53.940 --> 01:33:59.020
Jungle Beat where it uses the DDR pad, but it's not a music game. Yeah

01:34:00.020 --> 01:34:04.260
So I'm hoping hopefully something like that will come out justifying this purchase

01:34:04.560 --> 01:34:10.980
You know, I I don't want to knock this because I think you know Nintendo has always been they do a lot of kid-friendly things

01:34:11.160 --> 01:34:13.260
So I think this is gonna be a good thing

01:34:13.260 --> 01:34:16.360
I'm not gonna sit here and knock this mix because I think it's gonna be a good thing

01:34:16.360 --> 01:34:19.900
I think a lot of the Mario music is very good. I think it's gonna be a fun thing

01:34:19.900 --> 01:34:24.540
I think if you have a lot of parties and you have friends over that don't play DDR very much

01:34:24.540 --> 01:34:26.860
This is going to be a mix that can really

01:34:27.460 --> 01:34:31.380
Enable them to get into DDR a little more Nintendo knows one thing

01:34:31.380 --> 01:34:32.800
It's how to make a party game

01:34:32.800 --> 01:34:37.800
And so I don't doubt that one bit that any sort of party mode on that would be perfect

01:34:37.820 --> 01:34:43.260
So I'm not gonna say, you know, DDR Mario mix sucks because it doesn't it's just different

01:34:43.260 --> 01:34:49.580
It's not for you hardcore players. It's for kids and you know people that you know

01:34:49.580 --> 01:34:52.700
or not familiar with DDR, but maybe are Nintendo fans.

01:34:52.700 --> 01:34:55.340
I think this could expose DDR to a whole new audience, which

01:34:55.340 --> 01:34:56.220
is a good thing.

01:34:56.220 --> 01:34:58.420
Definitely.

01:34:58.420 --> 01:35:01.660
Questions from our chat room.

01:35:01.660 --> 01:35:05.940
So does Nintendo have a release time frame for DDR Mario Mix?

01:35:08.860 --> 01:35:11.960
We don't know of anything, because we didn't get a

01:35:11.960 --> 01:35:13.260
Nintendo press kit.

01:35:13.260 --> 01:35:15.220
But Jamie's in our chat right now, and I'm wondering if she

01:35:15.220 --> 01:35:17.500
was able to schmooze her way to get a press kit.

01:35:17.500 --> 01:35:19.500
We think by end of year.

01:35:19.500 --> 01:35:22.500
Hasn't everything we've been reading saying like October, November time frame-ish?

01:35:22.500 --> 01:35:26.500
By the way, UltraMix 3 and Extreme 2 are looking at the same time frame.

01:35:26.500 --> 01:35:28.500
Will be released, you know, end of year-ish.

01:35:28.500 --> 01:35:31.500
Definitely in time for the holiday season.

01:35:31.500 --> 01:35:34.500
I do remember Nintendogs is out August 22nd.

01:35:34.500 --> 01:35:35.500
That's the one thing I did here.

01:35:35.500 --> 01:35:37.500
Nintendogs, by the way.

01:35:37.500 --> 01:35:42.500
On the podcast, I named Nintendogs my favorite game of the whole damn show.

01:35:42.500 --> 01:35:43.500
Nintendogs is gonna rock.

01:35:43.500 --> 01:35:45.500
I can't wait for that game.

01:35:45.500 --> 01:35:54.500
gonna be friggin awesome so cute I just love dogs no but really um I can't wait

01:35:54.500 --> 01:36:00.780
for that Mario Kart advanced or not advanced so DS kind of disappointed me

01:36:00.780 --> 01:36:08.600
but um anyways um let's see here I was just gonna check real quick check some

01:36:08.600 --> 01:36:13.300
of the websites online see if we can answer that question yeah if I can't

01:36:13.300 --> 01:36:18.220
figure out when it's coming out, nope to be announced 2005. It's gonna be out this

01:36:18.220 --> 01:36:22.860
year I would say bank on October November that time frame I think that's

01:36:22.860 --> 01:36:26.500
a good it's got to be out for the holiday season honestly. By the way if

01:36:26.500 --> 01:36:29.660
you're a Nintendo fan another title not to miss that's coming out next month

01:36:29.660 --> 01:36:36.900
Meteos. Awesome puzzle game, awesome puzzle game. Let's see what are the

01:36:36.900 --> 01:36:40.420
Bomani games? I think that's it I think that's all the official Bomani

01:36:40.420 --> 01:36:45.620
releases that are coming out, so that takes us to the one of the money. So down

01:36:45.620 --> 01:36:50.420
in Kenshia Hall, low-key, Kenshia Hall. What do you think of Kenshia Hall this year?

01:36:50.420 --> 01:36:54.380
Kenshia Hall blew. It was a little weak compared to last year, and a lot of that

01:36:54.380 --> 01:36:58.620
was because Game Infinity got promoted to West Hall. So Game Infinity wasn't

01:36:58.620 --> 01:37:02.900
in Kenshia Hall this year. But there were some interesting things there.

01:37:02.900 --> 01:37:09.220
One exhibitor that was in Kenshia Hall was GetUpMove.com. They weren't

01:37:09.220 --> 01:37:13.620
listed in the program as Red Octane, they were actually listed as GetUpMove.com.

01:37:13.620 --> 01:37:14.620
This is the interesting thing.

01:37:14.620 --> 01:37:17.460
We went by the booth a couple times because when you're at E3, you end up walking the

01:37:17.460 --> 01:37:18.460
floor several times.

01:37:18.460 --> 01:37:20.740
You walk by the booths several times.

01:37:20.740 --> 01:37:26.580
When we went by the booth on Wednesday, all they had set up were the metal pads and no

01:37:26.580 --> 01:37:30.580
TVs and they had boxes for in the groove, display boxes.

01:37:30.580 --> 01:37:36.620
They were kind of promoting in the groove but nothing to show.

01:37:36.620 --> 01:37:38.660
So I was kind of like, well, that's kind of weird.

01:37:38.660 --> 01:37:41.860
I was a little surprised. I was like, wouldn't you want to show off your game that's coming

01:37:41.860 --> 01:37:46.680
out really soon? And I asked. I flat out asked the guy. I said, you know, I know there's

01:37:46.680 --> 01:37:50.520
things that have happened in the past few weeks that possibly have delayed the home

01:37:50.520 --> 01:37:54.460
release. What can you tell me about the release date of the home release? And he told me that

01:37:54.460 --> 01:38:02.660
he could say it was pushed back a little bit, but mid-June is the target release now. And

01:38:02.660 --> 01:38:06.500
he didn't say it was pushed back because of what was going on. In fact, the ref told me.

01:38:06.500 --> 01:38:10.540
Yeah, if I were to guess, I would say it's probably not because of that.

01:38:10.540 --> 01:38:14.380
It's probably because of the USB support that they were trying to fix.

01:38:14.380 --> 01:38:16.460
That would be my guess.

01:38:16.460 --> 01:38:17.460
I don't know.

01:38:17.460 --> 01:38:20.860
I think the people are saying it's because of Sony's delay or something.

01:38:20.860 --> 01:38:21.860
I don't know.

01:38:21.860 --> 01:38:24.860
We don't really know what the delay is, but we don't think it's related to the lawsuit

01:38:24.860 --> 01:38:28.340
anymore, which I guess I was proven wrong from last week.

01:38:28.340 --> 01:38:32.300
I was convinced that this was going to delay the home release, but hey, I was wrong.

01:38:32.300 --> 01:38:33.300
But you know what?

01:38:33.300 --> 01:38:37.240
said, I would love nothing more than to be proven wrong on it because I think the home

01:38:37.240 --> 01:38:40.380
release should come out, so it looks like it's coming out.

01:38:40.380 --> 01:38:47.580
And from what the rep had told me, they are going ahead with it because they feel that

01:38:47.580 --> 01:38:53.300
the lawsuit is more to do with the refitting of DDR arcade cabinets.

01:38:53.300 --> 01:38:57.180
Red Octane was named nowhere in that suit, so they are proceeding with the home release

01:38:57.180 --> 01:39:01.180
because they feel that the lawsuit is strictly aimed at the arcade releases.

01:39:01.180 --> 01:39:07.380
so they're gonna release this sucker in mid-June. My advice? If you want this game, buy it

01:39:07.380 --> 01:39:10.720
as soon as it comes out. If you don't want this game, don't buy it. But if you want this

01:39:10.720 --> 01:39:14.980
game, buy it as soon as it comes out. And I think you should at least check it out.

01:39:14.980 --> 01:39:18.500
You know, it's different. Loki, you got to check it out for the first time. What'd you

01:39:18.500 --> 01:39:19.500
think?

01:39:19.500 --> 01:39:26.860
Uh, well, it's everything I said it was. It's a damn ripoff of DDR, and it sucked. The end.

01:39:26.860 --> 01:39:34.620
Really I played it it sucked the note charts sucked the music sucked the graphics sucked and even the pads

01:39:34.620 --> 01:39:36.620
They played it on the brand new

01:39:37.020 --> 01:39:41.780
You know metal pads by red octane sucked. They killed my ankles

01:39:41.980 --> 01:39:49.060
It's the rubbery parts that were inset were inset too far and they were too rubbery and they actually there's no

01:39:49.180 --> 01:39:53.920
It's good for sticking to the pad, but it's not good if you want to actually do any freestyling or stuff on it

01:39:53.920 --> 01:40:10.920
I did not like their new pads, I thought they stunk, I would not spend my money on them, and I would not even touch nor play ever again in The Groove or in The Groove 2 or any sort of incarnation of In The Groove. It sucked ass and I do not support it at all.

01:40:12.920 --> 01:40:14.920
Now tell us how you really feel.

01:40:14.920 --> 01:40:21.920
Oh, okay. Here's how I really feel. I think that the interface is playing such as a stupid port of StepMania to the PlayStation 2.

01:40:21.920 --> 01:40:26.920
So all you people that want to play StepMania on the PlayStation 2, there you go. Here it is. Enjoy.

01:40:26.920 --> 01:40:30.920
But as far as wanting original music, you're not going to find it in The Groove.

01:40:30.920 --> 01:40:35.920
In The Groove is just a bunch of rehashed, really amateurish music that you're going to find there.

01:40:35.920 --> 01:40:38.920
Oh, sure. There's some good, you know, licensed songs in there. Good. Play those.

01:40:38.920 --> 01:40:41.920
That's about all you're going to enjoy as far as In The Groove goes.

01:40:41.920 --> 01:40:46.920
But hey if you want the you know something harder for you there you go enjoy that but guess what you're gonna have to shell

01:40:46.920 --> 01:40:50.760
out money for a nice metal pad in order to play those hard songs because guess what a

01:40:51.040 --> 01:40:52.740
Soft pad ain't gonna do it for you

01:40:52.740 --> 01:40:55.980
And you know what I don't think that those ignition pads are going to do it for you either

01:40:55.980 --> 01:41:01.480
So have fun playing a game, but I'm sure that unless you are a hardcore in the groove player

01:41:01.480 --> 01:41:03.480
You're gonna be disappointed with this so

01:41:03.880 --> 01:41:05.320
enjoy

01:41:05.320 --> 01:41:08.320
Wow, I was wondering when you were gonna rant this show I

01:41:09.320 --> 01:41:11.080
you know what I I

01:41:11.080 --> 01:41:15.080
Let me just put it this way, there's better music games coming out this year, don't waste your money.

01:41:15.080 --> 01:41:17.080
I didn't have the...

01:41:18.080 --> 01:41:22.080
When I first played In the Groove, I wasn't like, OMG this is the best thing ever,

01:41:22.080 --> 01:41:25.080
but I wasn't like anti-In the Groove like you were.

01:41:25.080 --> 01:41:32.080
It just grew on me, I think you should give it another chance, because In the Groove, it grew on me, as I played it more and more.

01:41:32.080 --> 01:41:38.080
I'm sorry though, but these people are going, oh it's not DDR! No, it is DDR, it's exactly DDR.

01:41:38.080 --> 01:41:44.960
I, I can't argue with you there. It's, it's, it's very, very much DDR. But, um, the dance

01:41:44.960 --> 01:41:50.680
pads, I completely disagree. I think the afterburners are great. I loved playing on them. I don't,

01:41:50.680 --> 01:41:53.600
that's where I don't get it. Because I thought they were great.

01:41:53.600 --> 01:41:57.480
Okay, the afterburners are okay pads. They just have a fatal flaw in it, and that's that

01:41:57.480 --> 01:42:01.520
they're inset too far. Raise them up just a few millimeters and you'll be perfect. They'll

01:42:01.520 --> 01:42:07.040
be a great pad. It's just right now, they're too far, so you're gonna, you're playing on

01:42:07.040 --> 01:42:11.360
it's awkward because they're inset too far, and that's why. I didn't like them. I played

01:42:11.360 --> 01:42:15.560
on a lot of different hardpads. There's, trust me, there are pads worse than the afterburners

01:42:15.560 --> 01:42:20.520
there, and we played on those right afterwards. Yeah, now, now, you, even though you're knocking

01:42:20.520 --> 01:42:25.560
on the afterburners, what happened after you left Red Octane's booth? You went to DDR Games

01:42:25.560 --> 01:42:30.640
booth, and you played on that metal pad, which has a bar, by the way, so this would be great

01:42:30.640 --> 01:42:34.640
for you and the Groove players, except... Except the thing is flat, and you can't tell

01:42:34.640 --> 01:42:38.440
where you are. It's soft pad syndrome. You basically float all over the pad and you miss

01:42:38.440 --> 01:42:42.440
stuff. Not only that, but it wasn't very sensitive at all. That's the other thing I didn't like

01:42:42.440 --> 01:42:46.120
about the afterburner. It didn't seem sensitive at all. Now, I was testing it to see...

01:42:46.120 --> 01:42:49.760
Is it maybe, is it maybe just that the afterburner was worn out from all the people playing on

01:42:49.760 --> 01:42:56.120
it? It's possible... When I played at the premiere, I thought the pads were pristine.

01:42:56.120 --> 01:43:00.640
I thought they were awesome pads. My, my complaints with it would be that one, the arrows are

01:43:00.640 --> 01:43:04.200
rubbery. They should be just like a metal type thing. Because honestly, if you're playing

01:43:04.200 --> 01:43:08.200
shoes you're still gonna get grip but if you want to actually slide on them you

01:43:08.200 --> 01:43:13.680
can actually do that as well they that I think would be beneficial for them the

01:43:13.680 --> 01:43:17.600
reason why it that the rubbery is that you stick too much and so it kills your

01:43:17.600 --> 01:43:21.440
ankles when you do that because it's just not quite like plexiglass and you

01:43:21.440 --> 01:43:25.800
get the same syndrome if you like play on some a pad that's sticky the same

01:43:25.800 --> 01:43:29.400
thing and this goes for the arcade mixes you'll get the same problem because it

01:43:29.400 --> 01:43:34.000
sticks too much and it doesn't you know give as much as you would on a normal

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:44.000
Alright, we're going to talk about the other dance pads that we saw in Kenshiya Hall in a little bit, but I'm going to actually just shift gears real quick here, because we actually have a special guest on our Skype line right now. Who is this?

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.000
Just my ass.

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:49.000
Hello, Dark Sakura, how are you?

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.000
Exhausted.

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:52.000
Yeah?

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:53.000
Tired.

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:54.000
Been in the car all day.

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:58.000
Yeah, I know how that feels. It kind of sucks driving in the car all day long. How was Disneyland?

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:05.040
Disneyland was pretty fun. They turned off the fast pass at Roger Rabbit though, that

01:44:05.040 --> 01:44:09.080
kind of made me upset. But other than that, it went on Indiana Jones twice.

01:44:09.080 --> 01:44:11.920
Very cool. What was the best ride you rode while you were there?

01:44:11.920 --> 01:44:16.300
Indiana Jones, without a doubt. Heck yeah. So we've been talking about E3

01:44:16.300 --> 01:44:20.800
tonight. Of course, obviously, that's what this show's been about. What were your impressions?

01:44:20.800 --> 01:44:25.200
Oh, we went to Timbuktu. What were your impressions of some of the stuff

01:44:25.200 --> 01:44:30.280
at E3. We've talked about Beatmania and the Konami DDRs and we were moving into In the

01:44:30.280 --> 01:44:32.760
Groove. What were your thoughts on some of those games?

01:44:32.760 --> 01:44:37.320
Beatmania, of course, was great. Actually, can you believe I got my first AAA on the

01:44:37.320 --> 01:44:42.160
stage in front of like a bajillion people? Hey, good deal.

01:44:42.160 --> 01:44:49.500
As far as the other stuff, of course, Katamari Damacy was cool. Call of Cthulhu was really

01:44:49.500 --> 01:44:55.420
freaking awesome. And I got to play Popocalist, which is a new...Adject got the license on

01:44:55.420 --> 01:45:03.060
that one, and they announced it at E3, and it was pretty awesome. It's a 2D RPG game.

01:45:03.060 --> 01:45:06.860
For anyone who's into the import scene or into anime, they probably are very familiar

01:45:06.860 --> 01:45:11.940
with this one, since it's very, very big. But I got to play a PSP debug, too. They're

01:45:11.940 --> 01:45:12.940
pretty heavy.

01:45:12.940 --> 01:45:16.140
All right. Now, by the way, I just want to add, for those of you guys listening at home

01:45:16.140 --> 01:45:20.480
right now. If you hear Jamie breaking up a little bit, don't adjust your speakers. It's

01:45:20.480 --> 01:45:24.240
just we're having a little issue with Skype. But we can still understand you, Jamie. It's

01:45:24.240 --> 01:45:28.360
just there's some weird skips in your voice. I don't know what's going on. Just Skype.

01:45:28.360 --> 01:45:33.360
I actually turned off the show. Oh, maybe that'll help. Okay. No, I already did. Oh,

01:45:33.360 --> 01:45:40.160
hmm. Alright, well. I already did. We'll see. What about the dance games coming out? DDR

01:45:40.160 --> 01:45:45.160
Xtreme Mix 3, Xtreme 2, DDR Mario Mix.

01:45:45.160 --> 01:45:49.160
Well, I looked at the game, actually I focused on the Mario one in particular.

01:45:49.160 --> 01:45:52.160
I took a bunch of pictures, they'll be up on the site soon.

01:45:52.160 --> 01:45:59.160
But as far as the other, I really didn't get to play them because of the injury to my hip from my car accident.

01:45:59.160 --> 01:46:03.160
I tried to play and it just ended up hurting way too badly.

01:46:03.160 --> 01:46:06.160
Although I do like the new mix of Jelly Kiss, that was pretty cool.

01:46:06.160 --> 01:46:09.160
We actually played Loki's bootleg earlier.

01:46:09.160 --> 01:46:10.160
It wasn't so bad.

01:46:10.160 --> 01:46:11.160
Did you say Loki's booty?

01:46:11.160 --> 01:46:12.160
No.

01:46:12.160 --> 01:46:13.160
Loki's bootleg.

01:46:13.160 --> 01:46:14.800
Oh.

01:46:14.800 --> 01:46:15.800
We did not play my ass.

01:46:15.800 --> 01:46:17.400
It broke up and it sounded like booty.

01:46:17.400 --> 01:46:20.840
No, we did not play Loki's booty.

01:46:20.840 --> 01:46:23.420
What did you think of, now did you go down to Kenshi Hall?

01:46:23.420 --> 01:46:26.480
We were just talking about some of the stuff we saw in Kenshi Hall.

01:46:26.480 --> 01:46:27.480
Yeah.

01:46:27.480 --> 01:46:28.480
Red Octane's.

01:46:28.480 --> 01:46:31.360
The Red Octane's paths were ass-worthy.

01:46:31.360 --> 01:46:33.000
I played on the DDR game.

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:34.000
Ha!

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:35.000
I don't get this.

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:36.000
I out-voted here.

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:37.960
I thought the After Burner paths were awesome.

01:46:37.960 --> 01:46:44.960
You know what? If they wanted to do a good pad, then Konami needs to re-release the DX pad for the U.S.

01:46:44.960 --> 01:46:52.960
Apart from that, I have not played on a single metal pad, other than ones that are homemade that have withstood my, you know, exacting standards.

01:46:52.960 --> 01:46:56.960
I don't get it. You know what? I didn't play on the E3 metal pad, I don't think.

01:46:56.960 --> 01:47:02.960
The DDR game ones were better, and those were injury-inflicting, as I'm sure Iguana Girl's foot will demonstrate.

01:47:02.960 --> 01:47:06.960
I totally have to disagree there. I thought those DDR game ones were kind of booty.

01:47:06.960 --> 01:47:13.040
But there was a delay on them. All right. All right, and they are very easy to injure yourself on

01:47:13.040 --> 01:47:16.800
I think it's ironic though that the DER game ones are the one that have the bar

01:47:17.160 --> 01:47:21.560
When red octane ought to be putting a bar on their pads if they're releasing in the groove, don't you think?

01:47:22.280 --> 01:47:27.920
Well, you know what the bar shouldn't be included at all because that just encourages people to rape it

01:47:27.920 --> 01:47:32.520
Oh, yeah, that's the other thing. I hate them making a flood of the bar. Okay, I

01:47:32.520 --> 01:47:40.180
Going back, I don't want to start another bar issue on the show, but I still say if

01:47:40.180 --> 01:47:44.200
the bar wasn't something that should have been used, then they wouldn't have put it

01:47:44.200 --> 01:47:45.200
on the thing.

01:47:45.200 --> 01:47:47.400
So, I'm okay with people bar reading.

01:47:47.400 --> 01:47:51.200
Well, yeah, but that goes to the same people who complain about using speed modifiers on

01:47:51.200 --> 01:47:52.200
DDR.

01:47:52.200 --> 01:47:54.200
If they didn't want it used, they wouldn't have put it in the damn game.

01:47:54.200 --> 01:47:55.200
Right.

01:47:55.200 --> 01:47:59.560
Of course, many people say, well, you know, oh, it shouldn't be there, blah, blah, blah.

01:47:59.560 --> 01:48:04.080
use your speed modifiers in 2DX, as well as using them in DDR.

01:48:04.080 --> 01:48:08.120
Right, and what's wrong with using the bar? Because the bar's there.

01:48:08.120 --> 01:48:12.200
Because it's a cop-out, it means you're weak.

01:48:12.200 --> 01:48:13.880
I disagree, but that's fine.

01:48:13.880 --> 01:48:20.000
You are weak and you rely on the bar for your support. You should stand on your own feet and

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:22.440
beat the game yourself.

01:48:22.440 --> 01:48:26.380
Any other E3? How was your week? How was your day outside of E3?

01:48:26.380 --> 01:48:28.620
I got sunburned.

01:48:28.620 --> 01:48:33.460
at Disneyland? I put some like everywhere except I forgot that my neckline

01:48:33.460 --> 01:48:37.340
with that shirt is just a little bit lower than I was thinking of because

01:48:37.340 --> 01:48:41.540
I have this really cool shirt but it sags just a little bit because it's just enough too big

01:48:41.540 --> 01:48:45.940
and so I didn't put any on my neckline and I was, my shoulder was getting sore and I

01:48:45.940 --> 01:48:46.780
thought it was from

01:48:46.780 --> 01:48:49.980
the shoulder strap on the camera rubbing up against my

01:48:49.980 --> 01:48:54.140
skin. Turned out I was sunburned and it's actually a little swollen.

01:48:54.140 --> 01:49:01.140
Did you do anything else in LA besides Disneyland and E3?

01:49:01.140 --> 01:49:08.140
We went to AI. I played lots of pop music, you know, huh?

01:49:08.140 --> 01:49:13.140
Actually, I just played all the Goonies and all the anime stuff.

01:49:13.140 --> 01:49:17.140
I thought Iroha was a little overrated, but that's just me.

01:49:17.140 --> 01:49:28.640
I played Beatmania 3's 7th final deal, just because I was waiting for Edo hot and it was

01:49:28.640 --> 01:49:33.920
really hard to hear and it wasn't all that much fun.

01:49:33.920 --> 01:49:38.540
We went to Roscoe's house for chicken and waffles on Wednesday and I had been really

01:49:38.540 --> 01:49:43.420
good on my eating all day because I was going to have some grits and country gravy.

01:49:43.420 --> 01:49:45.420
Believe it or not, the grits were substandard.

01:49:45.420 --> 01:49:52.420
Not good grits. However, the chicken livers were pretty awesome, and so was the chicken gravy.

01:49:52.420 --> 01:49:59.420
I had fried chicken liver. Say what you will, fried chicken liver's good. It's like my comfort food.

01:49:59.420 --> 01:50:03.420
I don't know. I don't think I'm brave enough to try one, but maybe someday.

01:50:03.420 --> 01:50:04.420
I used to eat the livers all the time.

01:50:04.420 --> 01:50:05.420
Then we went to karaoke.

01:50:05.420 --> 01:50:07.420
Did you sing anything at karaoke?

01:50:07.420 --> 01:50:09.420
I actually did, believe it or not.

01:50:09.420 --> 01:50:12.480
They had a that you could choose Chinese

01:50:13.640 --> 01:50:15.080
Indonesian

01:50:15.080 --> 01:50:17.080
Japanese Korean and

01:50:17.520 --> 01:50:23.080
English songs and I actually went on the Japanese list and found the opening Tulane on the

01:50:24.200 --> 01:50:28.380
Japanese list there was a bunch of other songs that sort of half new in Japanese, but this one was all in English

01:50:28.380 --> 01:50:29.580
So I sang it

01:50:29.580 --> 01:50:33.620
Hmm if it was if it was at the place on Thursday, I would sing that one but

01:50:33.620 --> 01:50:40.620
Anything else you want to share about E3? Things you saw at E3? Stuff you want to share with our listeners?

01:50:40.620 --> 01:50:48.620
I saw the PS3 demo and the Xbox 360 demo and I took a bajillion pictures of the PlayStation 3.

01:50:48.620 --> 01:50:55.620
The demos were pretty cool. There's like a motocross game that had a pretty excellent demo to it.

01:50:55.620 --> 01:51:02.620
They did a demonstration for the new Tekken thing with Jin and he was all sweaty and I was like, ooh, sweaty Jin.

01:51:02.620 --> 01:51:04.620
Yeah, pictures of that online.

01:51:04.620 --> 01:51:06.620
I played the crap out of Nintendogs.

01:51:06.620 --> 01:51:08.620
I played Frisbee with the puppies.

01:51:08.620 --> 01:51:10.620
They have Sweaty Gin online.

01:51:10.620 --> 01:51:12.620
Huh?

01:51:12.620 --> 01:51:14.620
A picture of Sweaty Gin online.

01:51:14.620 --> 01:51:16.620
Oooh.

01:51:16.620 --> 01:51:20.620
It's on IGN and it's super big so you can see all the sweat and pores and everything.

01:51:20.620 --> 01:51:22.620
Oh, hooray.

01:51:22.620 --> 01:51:24.620
Are you on the site yet? Do you know?

01:51:24.620 --> 01:51:28.620
I haven't checked. I've been home for all of two and a half hours.

01:51:28.620 --> 01:51:30.620
Oh, we'll have to check some of that out and let us know.

01:51:30.620 --> 01:51:37.620
It was long enough for me to post my picture, which I'm going to link in the chatroom, of the Reject False Icon sticker on Pac-Man's mouth.

01:51:37.620 --> 01:51:38.620
Okay.

01:51:40.620 --> 01:51:42.620
I put lots of stuff on the Katamari.

01:51:43.620 --> 01:51:49.620
Yeah, I actually ended up putting that sticker on because you put all this other stuff on there. You were like, you didn't want to keep doing it.

01:51:49.620 --> 01:51:54.620
I ended up getting four mouse pads, and I gave one to Iguana Girl because she didn't get one.

01:51:54.620 --> 01:52:03.620
I gave one to Julie because she was nice and babysat my big fat cat, and I kept two for myself. I'm going to take one to work.

01:52:03.620 --> 01:52:13.620
Oh, I actually managed to snag three, and I am going to give one to somebody, but the other one I'm actually going to give away on the show at a later date.

01:52:13.620 --> 01:52:19.620
Well, I've still got stuff to add to the bag of swag. You haven't mentioned that to our listeners.

01:52:19.620 --> 01:52:21.620
I haven't. Why don't you go ahead and tell them.

01:52:21.620 --> 01:52:25.620
tell them. Well, we're planning on doing a contest. We're not really sure how we're

01:52:25.620 --> 01:52:30.200
gonna make you embarrass yourselves for stuff, but you know a lot of this swag is

01:52:30.200 --> 01:52:34.860
going for bucks on eBay. I found out the slimes are going for $40 apiece. The what

01:52:34.860 --> 01:52:38.860
is going for $40? The slimes that they were giving out at the square picture

01:52:38.860 --> 01:52:44.380
thing. Oh my gosh. Really? Yeah, you can like just order them from Japan for like five bucks. I'm gonna sell mine now.

01:52:44.380 --> 01:52:49.780
How much are those BeatMania t-shirts going for? Oh, I'll tell you what, we've got

01:52:49.780 --> 01:52:53.780
I got Julie over here on eBay right now. Do you see any of the BeatMania t-shirts up there?

01:52:53.780 --> 01:52:55.780
Let me take a look here.

01:52:55.780 --> 01:52:57.780
She's actually found one.

01:52:57.780 --> 01:52:59.780
Let me see how much it is on eBay.

01:52:59.780 --> 01:53:02.780
Yeah, like I'm ever going to give mine to anybody.

01:53:02.780 --> 01:53:13.780
I know. I had people giving me pouty faces and puppy dog eyes for my BeatMania shirt and I said this is the one thing I'm keeping for myself.

01:53:13.780 --> 01:53:17.780
Now, I got yelled at for getting a Karaoke Revolution shirt for somebody else

01:53:17.780 --> 01:53:20.500
because I had this total bitch yell at me saying,

01:53:20.500 --> 01:53:22.580
you dug your claws into me to get that shirt out of there,

01:53:22.580 --> 01:53:23.460
you'd start me with your nails.

01:53:23.460 --> 01:53:24.380
I didn't even touch her.

01:53:24.380 --> 01:53:25.840
I don't know what the hell she was smoking.

01:53:25.840 --> 01:53:27.780
And then her boyfriend called me an asshole.

01:53:27.780 --> 01:53:29.580
And I didn't appreciate that because I'm

01:53:29.580 --> 01:53:30.880
trying to do something nice for someone else,

01:53:30.880 --> 01:53:33.820
because I ended up giving that t-shirt to somebody else.

01:53:33.820 --> 01:53:34.460
People suck.

01:53:34.460 --> 01:53:35.100
I hate them.

01:53:35.100 --> 01:53:37.860
The DS trailer for Twilight Princess

01:53:37.860 --> 01:53:39.980
is going for $76 right now.

01:53:39.980 --> 01:53:41.020
Oh my gosh.

01:53:41.020 --> 01:53:43.060
Yeah, if you've got a press kit from Nintendo,

01:53:43.060 --> 01:53:45.140
they actually have a DS cartridge with a Zelda trailer

01:53:45.140 --> 01:53:45.660
on it.

01:53:45.660 --> 01:53:49.660
The Metal Gear Solid, um, ooh, what is this?

01:53:49.660 --> 01:53:54.660
Um, we're still looking for this shirt. Someone put their stupid Tylenol Ouch shirt on.

01:53:54.660 --> 01:53:55.660
Okay, you know those...

01:53:55.660 --> 01:53:58.660
We're giving out free massages at the Tylenol Ouch booth.

01:53:58.660 --> 01:53:59.660
Right.

01:53:59.660 --> 01:54:01.660
I had a really cute, uh, cute mess over here.

01:54:01.660 --> 01:54:05.660
You know those, those, um, glossy things that they were giving out for free at Konami's booth?

01:54:05.660 --> 01:54:10.660
Uh, Metal Gear Solid 4, those are going for $10 a piece.

01:54:10.660 --> 01:54:12.660
I got two of those.

01:54:12.660 --> 01:54:13.660
I have two of those as well.

01:54:13.660 --> 01:54:14.660
Maybe we should put one on eBay.

01:54:14.660 --> 01:54:18.700
Or maybe we should put one in the bag. Yes, we're gonna give away a bag of swag

01:54:18.700 --> 01:54:21.860
Which it could end up being be worth hundreds of dollars

01:54:22.380 --> 01:54:26.680
By the time we don't want the promo. We love caught the Mario mouse pad five dollars

01:54:28.140 --> 01:54:31.720
Wow, yes stylus for Mario Kart ten dollars

01:54:31.720 --> 01:54:35.420
I will try to get a picture of the beat mania sure a little later. Basically all it is

01:54:36.180 --> 01:54:42.820
I'll tell you what. I have mine still rolled up. I took a picture of it in the bag. Uh-huh, and I'll try to

01:54:42.820 --> 01:54:47.380
to resize and put that picture up and post it in the chat room before we go.

01:54:47.380 --> 01:54:51.060
Good. We're going to dinner and going to see episode 3. That's cool. So yeah, some

01:54:51.060 --> 01:54:54.140
folks in the chat room want to see that BeatMania shirt. It's basically a black

01:54:54.140 --> 01:54:58.220
shirt with the orange BeatMania logo. It's nothing like super special, but... It has a

01:54:58.220 --> 01:55:02.020
little Konami one in the front over like where your heart would be. It's a freaking BeatMania shirt.

01:55:02.020 --> 01:55:12.260
If I had one. It's a freaking BeatMania shirt. What more do you need? In the USA. It looks really cool. It was really cool. But now, as soon as we find a way, you know, a way to

01:55:12.260 --> 01:55:16.140
to properly embarrass our listeners to get swag.

01:55:16.140 --> 01:55:20.340
We are compiling a bag of swag for you guys, and we will

01:55:20.340 --> 01:55:22.300
send that to whoever the lucky winner is.

01:55:22.300 --> 01:55:25.060
You don't have to go on eBay like some people do, because

01:55:25.060 --> 01:55:27.940
I'm laughing at whoever's bidding on some of this crap,

01:55:27.940 --> 01:55:30.100
although I'm sort of getting ideas now to take

01:55:30.100 --> 01:55:32.660
advantage of it.

01:55:32.660 --> 01:55:35.940
And according to Julie, hardly any of it's being bid on.

01:55:35.940 --> 01:55:40.820
Yeah, I think people are expecting more from eBay than

01:55:40.820 --> 01:55:41.740
they're actually going to get.

01:55:41.740 --> 01:55:59.740
You know, I went off earlier and people said in the chatroom I was actually sounding like you because I was just, I went off for a few minutes on Konami supporting their US audience and what they did at E3 really shows that they support their US audience by bringing in the Grooveloos and stuff.

01:55:59.740 --> 01:56:03.740
I was going to ask, what was your opinion on the Grooveloos and what they were doing?

01:56:03.740 --> 01:56:06.740
I thought that they were cool and one of them was on Roundhouse.

01:56:06.740 --> 01:56:10.740
He wasn't actually dancing though, he was the MC guy.

01:56:10.740 --> 01:56:12.740
Yeah. Well, I remembered him.

01:56:12.740 --> 01:56:13.740
Yeah.

01:56:13.740 --> 01:56:19.740
I remembered, you know, once it was mentioned to me, I was like, oh yeah, that is him, isn't it?

01:56:19.740 --> 01:56:23.740
But no, I was really impressed with them. They were great.

01:56:23.740 --> 01:56:29.740
You know, and it was just even, you know, and there were people, you know, you know, one of them won the giveaway.

01:56:29.740 --> 01:56:30.740
Yeah.

01:56:30.740 --> 01:56:36.740
And there were people complaining. I actually came back and heard about that later, about them complaining about them winning.

01:56:36.740 --> 01:56:42.740
They don't work for Konami, they were employed by Konami simply for E3.

01:56:42.740 --> 01:56:49.740
You know that they actually ended up, the powers that be at Konami, ended up vetoing that win and somebody else walked away with it.

01:56:49.740 --> 01:56:51.740
Oh, that's really crappy.

01:56:51.740 --> 01:56:55.740
Which, by the way, the most unenthusiastic winners ever, by the way.

01:56:55.740 --> 01:56:59.740
Konami, not only did they bring in the Groovles, we forgot to completely mention this,

01:56:59.740 --> 01:57:05.260
they actually gave away every day a 30-inch high-definition television set,

01:57:05.260 --> 01:57:08.500
all of their revolution games, and

01:57:08.500 --> 01:57:12.040
what else was it? It was a DVD? No, it was a sound system.

01:57:12.040 --> 01:57:16.020
A Logitech, super nice surround sound system. Every day they gave one of these away.

01:57:16.020 --> 01:57:20.180
Two of the most unenthusiastic winners I've ever seen in my life.

01:57:20.180 --> 01:57:24.980
Oh, I found my pictures of the Cybersex game. But this is just another example about how Konami

01:57:24.980 --> 01:57:28.820
supports their US audience because they gave away thousands of dollars in prizes

01:57:28.820 --> 01:57:39.220
promote DDR. All right. There's a 360 faceplate that someone got and that's

01:57:39.220 --> 01:57:43.580
going for $100 on eBay right now. Yeah I heard about that, the 360 faceplate.

01:57:43.580 --> 01:57:50.060
Micro erasers are going for money too. I saw those. Anything else you want to

01:57:50.060 --> 01:57:59.060
share with us Dark Sakura? Really, haha, I got to go to E3. No seriously, it was really

01:57:59.060 --> 01:58:05.340
good. I got very worn out walking all over the place. Now I'm sunburned from Disneyland.

01:58:05.340 --> 01:58:10.020
But in about two minutes, you guys should be able to check out the picture of the Beat

01:58:10.020 --> 01:58:15.340
Mania shirt in my swag bag. Somebody posted somebody else at the show wearing one, but

01:58:15.340 --> 01:58:18.860
go ahead and post your picture anyway. Give them a nice chance to. Mine's actually the

01:58:18.860 --> 01:58:23.700
rolled up one also my free copy of the magic the gathering uh...

01:58:23.700 --> 01:58:25.600
online uh... card game

01:58:25.600 --> 01:58:26.880
okay

01:58:26.880 --> 01:58:31.620
and the way that i'll be talking and uh... academy mouse

01:58:31.620 --> 01:58:36.120
and actually i don't have i gave away my spare stylus and so he's got an

01:58:36.120 --> 01:58:37.700
extra something

01:58:37.700 --> 01:58:38.720
uh...

01:58:38.720 --> 01:58:42.640
but we've got we've got some stuff that we can throw in the bag and uh...

01:58:42.640 --> 01:58:47.420
i did by the way check the nintendo uh... press kit which i did get a copy of

01:58:47.420 --> 01:58:50.180
There's actually autographed stickers in there by Miyamoto.

01:58:50.180 --> 01:58:50.680
Oh, cool.

01:58:50.680 --> 01:58:52.940
Were you able to look up, if you have a Nintendo press kit,

01:58:52.940 --> 01:58:54.940
I don't know if you have any information on DDR Mario Mix.

01:58:54.940 --> 01:58:55.020
I looked at the tape.

01:58:55.020 --> 01:58:55.780
The tape's not there.

01:58:55.780 --> 01:58:56.740
Oh, for Mario Mix?

01:58:56.740 --> 01:58:57.240
No.

01:58:57.240 --> 01:59:00.660
And though I have it right here, let me get to that page one more time.

01:59:00.660 --> 01:59:02.900
It was really fast.

01:59:02.900 --> 01:59:04.220
It got a large page.

01:59:04.220 --> 01:59:07.020
Donkey Konga 2.

01:59:07.020 --> 01:59:07.860
Hey, here we go.

01:59:07.860 --> 01:59:08.740
Read you what it says.

01:59:08.740 --> 01:59:10.060
I played Donkey Konga 2.

01:59:10.060 --> 01:59:11.980
You know what song I played in Donkey Konga 2?

01:59:11.980 --> 01:59:14.820
Headstrong, which is some rock song.

01:59:14.820 --> 01:59:17.100
I was like, what the hell is this doing in Donkey Konga?

01:59:17.100 --> 01:59:18.340
but it was cool, whatever.

01:59:18.340 --> 01:59:21.220
Well, let me read the little blurb on here, okay?

01:59:21.220 --> 01:59:22.060
Okay.

01:59:22.060 --> 01:59:23.740
Mario must recover the stolen music keys

01:59:23.740 --> 01:59:25.480
before the unstable power of music

01:59:25.480 --> 01:59:27.740
destroys the entire Mushroom Kingdom.

01:59:27.740 --> 01:59:30.660
Shake your thing to over 25 dance flavored songs

01:59:30.660 --> 01:59:33.540
from classic Nintendo themes to familiar favorites

01:59:33.540 --> 01:59:35.260
and recover the missing keys.

01:59:35.260 --> 01:59:37.860
With five difficulty levels, dancers of all abilities

01:59:37.860 --> 01:59:39.060
can get into the groove.

01:59:39.060 --> 01:59:40.460
The special workout feature tracks

01:59:40.460 --> 01:59:42.560
the calories burn while playing, strut your moves

01:59:42.560 --> 01:59:44.240
and break a sweat to the beat.

01:59:44.240 --> 01:59:45.080
No date.

01:59:45.080 --> 01:59:45.920
Hmm, interesting.

01:59:45.920 --> 01:59:51.000
Do you remember being told sometime this fall? Yeah, I'm I'm almost positive. We're gonna see October November

01:59:54.120 --> 02:00:00.240
I got to meet him. Oh, did you I thought I ran into him actually I was he does actually walking away from konami

02:00:00.960 --> 02:00:02.520
I'm not gonna be able to get the picture

02:00:02.520 --> 02:00:05.600
He says because we actually need to go because we get to eat before going to that's fine

02:00:05.600 --> 02:00:11.620
All right, um, but I did get to meet him and I got to you know, I actually we were about to collide

02:00:11.620 --> 02:00:17.800
So I said, you know saying I'm gonna sigh and he's really surprised and said thank you and have a good time

02:00:18.440 --> 02:00:23.440
Awesome. Well, good job. You know, um, did you get chance to meet Togo? No, I didn't

02:00:23.440 --> 02:00:25.840
Oh, I I got a picture with Togo. He was cool

02:00:26.600 --> 02:00:28.600
so

02:00:32.560 --> 02:00:34.560
All right, have fun

02:00:34.560 --> 02:00:40.560
Um, but, uh, I'm sorry I can't be at this show tonight. We only got back, I only got back later.

02:00:40.560 --> 02:00:42.560
Hey, I have one more thing to add, Jamie.

02:00:42.560 --> 02:00:43.560
Yeah.

02:00:43.560 --> 02:00:51.560
Um, it was just announced today on, uh, PSP Hacker that someone's working on a PC Engine emulator for the PSP.

02:00:51.560 --> 02:00:53.560
PC Engine emulator for the PSP.

02:00:53.560 --> 02:00:54.560
Yeah.

02:00:54.560 --> 02:00:55.560
I've gotta see this.

02:00:55.560 --> 02:01:01.560
I thought you'd like that. Alright. We're gonna let you go, uh, Jamie, but have fun at the movie, okay?

02:01:01.560 --> 02:01:02.560
Alright, have a good time.

02:01:02.560 --> 02:01:03.560
Alright, we'll see you next time.

02:01:03.560 --> 02:01:05.560
Bye bye, we'll see you next week, right?

02:01:05.560 --> 02:01:07.560
We'll see you next week?

02:01:07.560 --> 02:01:09.560
Yep, and reject Pausegones.

02:01:09.560 --> 02:01:11.560
Alright, see ya! Bye.

02:01:11.560 --> 02:01:17.560
Alright, that was DarkSakura, who's not here tonight, but she was able to bless us with her presents anyway.

02:01:17.560 --> 02:01:19.560
One way or another.

02:01:19.560 --> 02:01:23.560
Let's see, what we're going to do is we're going to take a break.

02:01:23.560 --> 02:01:27.560
Karaoke Party we still have to talk about a little bit, because we haven't really...

02:01:27.560 --> 02:01:30.560
Somebody in the chat room is asking about it right now, we never really did get to that.

02:01:30.560 --> 02:01:35.560
So we'll talk about Karaoke Party. I want to talk about a new music game coming to your cell phone.

02:01:35.560 --> 02:01:39.560
I hinted about this one earlier. It's a brand new music game coming to your cell phone.

02:01:39.560 --> 02:01:42.560
I'll talk about that when we come back after a quick break.

02:01:42.560 --> 02:01:44.560
So let's do that break.

02:01:44.560 --> 02:01:50.560
And we'll start it off with In the Heat of the Night, which is going to be in DDR Extreme 2.

02:01:50.560 --> 02:01:52.560
And we'll be back with more...

02:01:52.560 --> 02:01:55.560
This is just going to be a potpourri break, I think.

02:01:55.560 --> 02:02:00.560
And we'll be back with more Orange Lawns radio after this.

02:02:00.560 --> 02:02:02.560
In the heat of the night

02:02:07.560 --> 02:02:09.560
In the heat of the night

02:02:15.560 --> 02:02:20.560
Why did our feelings die in action

02:02:20.560 --> 02:02:23.560
When we fought satisfaction

02:02:23.560 --> 02:02:29.560
But our hearts and heads always saved me

02:02:29.560 --> 02:02:34.560
Why? There's a love of all it's magic

02:02:34.560 --> 02:02:38.560
It's a cute kind of tragic

02:02:38.560 --> 02:02:42.560
We were here for the best

02:02:42.560 --> 02:02:46.560
In the heat of the night

02:02:46.560 --> 02:02:49.560
We're too close to the fire

02:02:49.560 --> 02:02:53.560
And the power of our hearts

02:02:53.560 --> 02:02:56.560
Makes me cry inside

02:02:56.560 --> 02:03:03.560
In the heat of the night, marching close to the fire

02:03:03.560 --> 02:03:10.560
And the power of our hearts, made of me by desire

02:03:10.560 --> 02:03:14.560
In the heat of the night

02:03:17.560 --> 02:03:21.560
In the heat of the night

02:03:21.560 --> 02:03:28.560
And the hate of the night

02:03:28.560 --> 02:03:30.560
You

02:03:58.560 --> 02:04:06.560
I want to save you all

02:04:06.560 --> 02:04:09.560
Here, we can party

02:04:09.560 --> 02:04:12.560
On those hills on me

02:04:12.560 --> 02:04:15.560
I know you feel

02:04:15.560 --> 02:04:19.560
Like a rainbow

02:04:19.560 --> 02:04:22.560
Needing bigger than you I

02:04:22.560 --> 02:04:25.560
Needing better than I

02:04:55.560 --> 02:05:02.560
And I don't know who you really make you hide

02:05:02.560 --> 02:05:06.560
We're living under power

02:05:32.560 --> 02:05:56.560
Let me be your fantasy, it's me, ecstasy

02:07:56.560 --> 02:08:00.560
Floyd's snake, Floyd's snake, can you hear what I'm saying?

02:08:00.560 --> 02:08:03.560
Well this time they took a man that wants to backtrack.

02:08:03.560 --> 02:08:07.560
I'm gonna kick your ass, beat him, kill him all.

02:08:07.560 --> 02:08:13.560
Down, what am I gonna do?

02:08:16.560 --> 02:08:19.560
Have you ever seen cool damn like this?

02:08:19.560 --> 02:08:33.560
Orange Lounge Radio. We put your thing down, flip it and reverse it.

02:08:33.560 --> 02:08:48.560
We are back and we are going to open up the Skype line you guys, so you guys can call in and talk to us and ask us questions and give us your feedback on what you think about the various releases of E3 as well.

02:08:48.560 --> 02:08:54.560
So we're going to get to that. If you want more details on how you can be a part of that, www.orangelaunchradio.com

02:08:54.560 --> 02:08:56.560
Click on interact with us.

02:08:56.560 --> 02:09:05.560
But first, I want to give you guys a few notes on some other little game releases that they had at E3 on some other games that are coming out.

02:09:05.560 --> 02:09:07.560
Guitar Hero.

02:09:07.560 --> 02:09:12.560
Guitar Hero, they weren't showing anything at Red Octane's booth to the public.

02:09:12.560 --> 02:09:16.560
And, in fact, when I asked about it, or when Loki asked about it, we kind of got the run-around

02:09:16.560 --> 02:09:20.080
just saying, oh, well, we'll have more information out soon to the press, I can't say anything

02:09:20.080 --> 02:09:21.080
right now, da-da-da.

02:09:21.080 --> 02:09:25.640
Well, it turns out they're actually showing the game behind closed doors, and one of our

02:09:25.640 --> 02:09:28.480
staffers got back there anyway, na-na-na-na-na.

02:09:28.480 --> 02:09:30.520
So we can tell you about Guitar Hero.

02:09:30.520 --> 02:09:32.960
Loki, I'll let you talk about this one.

02:09:32.960 --> 02:09:34.240
You're a big guitar fan.

02:09:34.240 --> 02:09:38.060
Well, this game, it's very similar to Amplitude.

02:09:38.060 --> 02:09:42.200
There's actually some wonderful screenshots online right now.

02:09:42.200 --> 02:09:46.140
looks like amplitude. In the middle you've got all your stuff, it's kind of coming towards

02:09:46.140 --> 02:09:50.140
you. I wouldn't say it's exactly like amplitude so much as it's amplitude and karaoke revolution

02:09:50.140 --> 02:09:55.300
kind of combining with each other. Because you have to remember harmonics also helps

02:09:55.300 --> 02:09:59.200
with making karaoke revolution so it's kind of obvious that, you know. It's sort of like,

02:09:59.200 --> 02:10:03.620
it's more like amplitude only because the stuff's coming towards you. It's that sort

02:10:03.620 --> 02:10:08.200
of perspective. However, it is like karaoke revolution because on the side there's like

02:10:08.200 --> 02:10:11.440
a meter that's, you know, kind of a crowd meter, very similar to

02:10:11.440 --> 02:10:15.680
Karaoke Revolution, and basically it's five keys.

02:10:15.680 --> 02:10:20.320
However, depending on what difficulty you play, it's anywhere from three to five keys.

02:10:20.320 --> 02:10:24.960
And I thought that was kind of cool. And now the songs that are going to be in it,

02:10:24.960 --> 02:10:29.220
very similar to what Harmonics did before when they released Karaoke Revolution,

02:10:29.220 --> 02:10:33.820
they were actually doing covers of classic songs. They get these guys to go

02:10:33.820 --> 02:10:35.040
in the studio and re-record them.

02:10:35.040 --> 02:11:04.960
Same deal for Guitar Hero, is what's going to happen. Same deal for Guitar Hero, except for the ones, obviously, that are, you know, that beaguitarhero.com. Right, beaguitarhero.com. If you have a friend who's in a band who might appreciate some exposure from being in this game, or you're one of these people, have them go check out the site, beaguitarhero.com. Now, considering how much you went off on Red Octane a little bit earlier, does this redeem them a little bit, you think? Well, I wasn't going off on Red Octane. I was going off on Rock Surf for the really crappy game. Red Octane, they're doing no bad.

02:11:04.960 --> 02:11:09.240
bad, because they're trying to actually distribute a dance game, which I give them credit for

02:11:09.240 --> 02:11:12.440
that, because at least they're trying to do something. I wish they'd picked a better game,

02:11:12.440 --> 02:11:18.080
but hey, when there's nothing else out there other than DDR, what are you going to do?

02:11:18.080 --> 02:11:21.880
But as far as them actually distributing this game, this is actually a very good move for

02:11:21.880 --> 02:11:26.500
them, because there are no other Guitar Freaks type games, and I think this will actually

02:11:26.500 --> 02:11:31.520
exceed Guitar Freaks, which isn't that hard, since Guitar Freaks really hasn't changed

02:11:31.520 --> 02:11:37.360
much since like Fifth Mix, so. But hey, it's more of a challenge, and there is the same

02:11:37.360 --> 02:11:42.540
stuff in there that you would expect from Guitar Freaks, and it looks like they've actually

02:11:42.540 --> 02:11:47.940
kind of got some hold notes in place, and from what I hear, the controller, even though

02:11:47.940 --> 02:11:53.680
it has five key, it actually allows you to slide your hand along the different buttons

02:11:53.680 --> 02:11:59.780
to be able to hit them easier, so it's actually like playing a guitar, which is nice. So,

02:11:59.780 --> 02:12:09.780
But I managed to squeeze a little more information out of the guy when we were there asking him questions, all of course very vague answers.

02:12:09.780 --> 02:12:16.780
I asked him if there was going to be a drum hero type game and they're all, we're working on something.

02:12:16.780 --> 02:12:21.780
And also, so maybe a drum game coming soon?

02:12:21.780 --> 02:12:22.780
Possibly.

02:12:22.780 --> 02:12:24.780
Possibly.

02:12:24.780 --> 02:12:31.780
So, that's something, and definitely there's some pretty cool shots, like I said, online,

02:12:31.780 --> 02:12:33.780
and we'll probably have some more on our website soon enough.

02:12:33.780 --> 02:12:36.780
We're hoping we can get some more exclusive shots for our website very soon, we'll see.

02:12:36.780 --> 02:12:41.780
And we're going to have those probably, and it looks very similar to Karrick Revolution,

02:12:41.780 --> 02:12:47.780
just like, because you've got the CG guy on stage, the crowd, very similar, so it'll be interesting.

02:12:47.780 --> 02:12:52.780
Very interesting. Another game out there, Tycho Drummaster, you remember this game,

02:12:52.780 --> 02:12:56.060
this game. It was actually shown for the first time at last year's E3.

02:12:56.060 --> 02:13:00.300
Taiko Drum Master, of course, was released before Christmas last year.

02:13:00.300 --> 02:13:05.140
So it's had some limited success. It's been doing pretty good, I think.

02:13:05.140 --> 02:13:08.260
Folks enjoy it. It's kind of a different sort of music game title.

02:13:08.260 --> 02:13:12.580
Well now, Taiko Drum Master is available for your cell phone.

02:13:12.580 --> 02:13:16.180
This is something that they were showing at E3. Namco actually has a lot of cell

02:13:16.180 --> 02:13:17.700
phone games they're doing now,

02:13:17.700 --> 02:13:21.380
and one of their series they're pushing is Arcade Classics.

02:13:21.380 --> 02:13:25.420
The folks at NamcoCell were actually very nice to me and I've got to admit

02:13:25.420 --> 02:13:28.500
you know and they didn't have to be nice me for me to say this but their cell

02:13:28.500 --> 02:13:29.220
phone games

02:13:29.220 --> 02:13:32.380
are pretty nice considering that they're cell phone games

02:13:32.380 --> 02:13:35.600
I mean in the end they're still games on your cell phone

02:13:35.600 --> 02:13:39.320
they're not gonna knock your socks off it's not going to be a Game Boy quality

02:13:39.320 --> 02:13:39.840
game

02:13:39.840 --> 02:13:43.420
but for a cell phone game they're pretty cool. And in other news

02:13:43.420 --> 02:13:46.460
the N-Gage arena, empty. Yeah

02:13:46.460 --> 02:13:51.100
the sad thing is these Namco things running on Java on a cell phone

02:13:51.100 --> 02:13:53.260
is better than anything I've seen on an N-Gage.

02:13:53.260 --> 02:13:57.860
And I honestly, I did walk through the N-Gage booth, I checked it out.

02:13:57.860 --> 02:14:00.980
They're releasing a new version of the N-Gage, N-Gage 2 I guess.

02:14:00.980 --> 02:14:04.740
I played Civilization on N-Gage and couldn't figure out what the heck I was doing.

02:14:04.740 --> 02:14:08.300
It's just, it's interesting.

02:14:08.300 --> 02:14:13.300
I know there are other competitors out there that are not exactly N-Gage and not exactly

02:14:13.300 --> 02:14:18.100
a Sony product that are portable, that are probably doing better than they are, so.

02:14:18.100 --> 02:14:25.600
But hey, whatever, you know, they refuse to die, so at least let them, you know, try, but, yeah.

02:14:25.600 --> 02:14:26.600
Interesting.

02:14:26.600 --> 02:14:28.400
Um, so Tyco Drum Master, how's this work?

02:14:28.400 --> 02:14:31.900
It looks like you actually used four and six to hit the different drums on your cell phone.

02:14:31.900 --> 02:14:34.600
You used four and six with five being a drum roll.

02:14:34.600 --> 02:14:36.200
We actually have a video of this game.

02:14:36.200 --> 02:14:40.000
Unfortunately, it doesn't have any sound, but we will post the video to our website a little later.

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:42.200
I'm going to do a little mini feature on this game.

02:14:42.200 --> 02:14:44.600
I don't think this is something that's going to appeal to everybody,

02:14:44.600 --> 02:14:49.280
But you know for those you guys that have wanted a music game to take with you on your cell phone something to do with

02:14:49.280 --> 02:14:56.000
Your board taiko drum master has a dozen songs from the original release now granted. It's a cell phone

02:14:56.000 --> 02:15:01.840
so it's not gonna be the same quality, but still you know, it's something and it has the animation still and everything and

02:15:02.640 --> 02:15:07.940
Same types of rolls and combos and everything you remember for the original taiko drum master. This is available now

02:15:08.160 --> 02:15:12.860
They're saying per their press release. It's available now. So check it out. See if your carrier has this

02:15:12.860 --> 02:15:18.100
I imagine it's not available through all carriers, but I do know I'm a Sprint user myself and

02:15:18.100 --> 02:15:22.700
we do have Namco releases on our cell phone, so I believe this should be there, so I'm

02:15:22.700 --> 02:15:24.300
going to look for it.

02:15:24.300 --> 02:15:33.180
I have AT&T, and I know they carry Namco stuff, however I'm not buying any of it because it's

02:15:33.180 --> 02:15:36.100
way too damn expensive and they charge me like way too much money.

02:15:36.100 --> 02:15:37.620
Aren't they only like five bucks for the game?

02:15:37.620 --> 02:15:39.100
At least Sprint only charges like five bucks a game.

02:15:39.100 --> 02:15:40.820
Yeah, they're five dollars for the game.

02:15:40.820 --> 02:15:47.820
They don't charge you, they don't tell you that the download data was also included or not included with that.

02:15:47.820 --> 02:15:56.820
Like for example, I downloaded a 300K picture that was on a website that I was looking for movie tickets on Fandango, thank you.

02:15:56.820 --> 02:16:02.820
And the picture cost me $7. Thank you AT&T, I will never use your web feature again.

02:16:02.820 --> 02:16:09.820
Someone in our chat room is saying that it's only on Verizon and available for a specific number of phones.

02:16:09.820 --> 02:16:15.820
of phones. I didn't see anything in their release that indicated that, but I, the lady

02:16:15.820 --> 02:16:20.220
at Namco was kind enough to give me her card, so I will write her and ask. Find out, because

02:16:20.220 --> 02:16:22.780
maybe they're going to port it to others in the future, I don't know. I will write her

02:16:22.780 --> 02:16:32.500
and find out. That's what I will do. Alright, let's see. What else do we have? What was

02:16:32.500 --> 02:16:35.780
the other game I wanted to talk about? Karaoke Revolution Party. Did you look at this at

02:16:35.780 --> 02:16:38.260
at all, Loki? I know you're a big Karaoke Revolution fan.

02:16:38.260 --> 02:16:43.660
Oh yeah, don't you know me? I'm the huge karaoke fan. No, I stayed far, far, far, far away

02:16:43.660 --> 02:16:50.260
from this game. Yes, far away. I did not touch this game. I did not look at this game. I

02:16:50.260 --> 02:16:56.460
stayed far away like it was my kryptonite and I was Superman.

02:16:56.460 --> 02:17:00.300
Well, what have you heard about Karaoke Revolution Party? Did you see the new sing and dance

02:17:00.300 --> 02:17:02.180
mode where you can sing and dance at the same time?

02:17:02.180 --> 02:17:05.420
Oh yeah, that'll be fun. Not only will I sound like an idiot,

02:17:05.420 --> 02:17:10.020
I'll look like one too. Alright, well for those of you guys that actually enjoy

02:17:10.020 --> 02:17:11.620
Karaoke Revolution, I

02:17:11.620 --> 02:17:16.340
enjoy the game. You will now be able to sing and dance. Here's the crazy thing.

02:17:16.340 --> 02:17:20.660
It's coming out on Xbox, PlayStation 2,

02:17:20.660 --> 02:17:25.700
and GameCube. GameCube will be getting a Karaoke Revolution release for the first

02:17:25.700 --> 02:17:27.300
time, so that was kind of a big news

02:17:27.300 --> 02:17:31.100
right there. You will be able to get this on GameCube. A little bit unclear if the

02:17:31.100 --> 02:17:34.380
Sing and Dance will be in the GameCube version, but they will get at least the

02:17:34.380 --> 02:17:39.460
Sing part. I think they will get the Dance part as well, we'll see. Some of the

02:17:39.460 --> 02:17:44.940
songs that were in it, the only ones I remember were Crazy in Love, Material

02:17:44.940 --> 02:17:50.800
Girl was in it, because I actually did that one, Endless Love, Endless Love, Play

02:17:50.800 --> 02:17:57.260
That Funky Music White Boy. The interface has changed, this is why they're not

02:17:57.260 --> 02:17:59.980
calling it Karaoke Revolution 4, but they're actually calling it Karaoke

02:17:59.980 --> 02:18:03.100
Revolution Party, because they actually went and did some remodeling to the interface.

02:18:03.100 --> 02:18:07.140
There's now a create your own character mode in it as well, and of course the singing and

02:18:07.140 --> 02:18:08.140
dancing.

02:18:08.140 --> 02:18:11.560
So you can actually sing on easy and dance on hard.

02:18:11.560 --> 02:18:15.520
About the hardest it gets is a seven-footer, but trust me, you guys, it is a lot harder

02:18:15.520 --> 02:18:16.820
than it sounds.

02:18:16.820 --> 02:18:19.780
Those of you guys that think you will be able to just do a seven-footer and sing at the

02:18:19.780 --> 02:18:23.580
same time, it is not as easy as you would think.

02:18:23.580 --> 02:18:24.580
It's going to be hard.

02:18:24.580 --> 02:18:28.740
Unless you really know the song, like, I know my material girl, okay?

02:18:28.740 --> 02:18:31.500
So I was able to easily do the sing and dance mode because I

02:18:31.500 --> 02:18:33.500
already know the lyrics and the melody and everything.

02:18:33.500 --> 02:18:34.820
I didn't really need the bars.

02:18:34.820 --> 02:18:37.700
Because the way the dance mode works, it doesn't look like

02:18:37.700 --> 02:18:38.540
normal DDR.

02:18:38.540 --> 02:18:41.860
If you've ever played Karaoke Revolution, the bars scroll

02:18:41.860 --> 02:18:45.020
horizontally across the bottom of the screen, and then it

02:18:45.020 --> 02:18:45.860
guides your pitch.

02:18:45.860 --> 02:18:48.740
Well, the arrows show up, and they scroll horizontally at

02:18:48.740 --> 02:18:50.140
the bottom of the screen as well.

02:18:50.140 --> 02:18:53.220
So it's a little different.

02:18:53.220 --> 02:18:55.420
All right.

02:18:55.420 --> 02:18:59.420
So, let's go ahead and open up the Skype line.

02:18:59.420 --> 02:19:00.420
Okay.

02:19:00.420 --> 02:19:01.420
Oh, maybe not just yet.

02:19:01.420 --> 02:19:04.420
I just had a few other things I wanted to cover.

02:19:04.420 --> 02:19:08.420
It's not E3 related, but it is DDR related.

02:19:08.420 --> 02:19:11.420
Dancing Stage Unleashed 2.

02:19:11.420 --> 02:19:16.420
It was released recently, actually last week.

02:19:16.420 --> 02:19:21.420
Basically, for those who don't know, that is the UK version of UltraMix 2.

02:19:21.420 --> 02:19:37.420
And pretty much it's the same stuff that we had in UltraMix II, of course new licensed stuff, with stuff featuring like I See You Baby, which I have no idea what that is, Hot Stuff, Hip Teens Don't Wear Blue Jeans.

02:19:37.420 --> 02:19:43.420
Is that that I See You Baby, Shakin' That Ass, isn't that song? I bet it's that song.

02:19:43.420 --> 02:19:51.620
is that song, A Talent Called Malice, Circles, Get It On, and Hanging on the Telephone, which

02:19:51.620 --> 02:19:55.920
is very interesting enough.

02:19:55.920 --> 02:20:04.620
We actually do have, well, DDRUK being the ones that are on top of the ripping of different

02:20:04.620 --> 02:20:07.340
like stuff for the Sims scene.

02:20:07.340 --> 02:20:10.500
So all the official stuff, we're already out for that, even though it was released like

02:20:10.500 --> 02:20:12.800
the other week.

02:20:12.800 --> 02:20:16.800
So, we'll have some of that stuff to play for you guys pretty soon.

02:20:16.800 --> 02:20:21.800
And I See You Baby is the one you think it is, and it's a Fat Boy Slim radio edit.

02:20:21.800 --> 02:20:23.800
That's going to be pretty interesting.

02:20:23.800 --> 02:20:27.800
But yeah, we'll have some of those songs available for you pretty soon, actually.

02:20:27.800 --> 02:20:28.800
Sounds good.

02:20:28.800 --> 02:20:29.800
Maybe even a show.

02:20:29.800 --> 02:20:33.800
Also, I want to put out there that song pack 11, I don't know if it's out, but at least

02:20:33.800 --> 02:20:36.800
it's been announced that it's coming out.

02:20:36.800 --> 02:20:40.800
I have not been able to get on Xbox Live in a couple weeks, so I have not seen myself.

02:20:40.800 --> 02:20:45.200
I'm sure somebody in the chat room will correct me, however, one way or the other.

02:20:45.200 --> 02:20:50.920
Yeah, it's going to be actually featuring, what was it, Diamond Jealousy by Kiryamoga,

02:20:50.920 --> 02:21:00.160
that's hot, Guilty by DJ Setup, Helpless by Teko, Hold On Me by Tiger Yamamoto, which

02:21:00.160 --> 02:21:07.720
was also in DDR Extreme, and Open the PA by Akira Ishihara.

02:21:07.720 --> 02:21:11.540
And that's the one we had no idea what game that's from.

02:21:11.540 --> 02:21:13.900
It's a transplant of some sort, but we don't know from where it's from.

02:21:13.900 --> 02:21:14.900
I have no idea.

02:21:14.900 --> 02:21:16.060
I don't recognize it.

02:21:16.060 --> 02:21:17.540
It's not from Dance Maniacs.

02:21:17.540 --> 02:21:19.320
It's not from Para.

02:21:19.320 --> 02:21:21.720
It's probably Beat Mania or Beat Mania 2, yeah.

02:21:21.720 --> 02:21:26.020
Maybe somebody in the chat room will know where that is, but yeah.

02:21:26.020 --> 02:21:27.020
All right.

02:21:27.020 --> 02:21:29.140
Now, can we open up the Skype line?

02:21:29.140 --> 02:21:30.140
Yes.

02:21:30.140 --> 02:21:31.140
All right.

02:21:31.140 --> 02:21:32.140
Let's do that.

02:21:32.140 --> 02:21:33.140
Let's take some calls.

02:21:33.140 --> 02:21:35.820
If you want to call in on the Skype line, www.orangeloungeradio.com.

02:21:44.820 --> 02:21:48.820
any comments on a lot of the various news that comes out lately because

02:21:48.820 --> 02:21:52.660
there's been a lot of freaking news lately go ahead and let us know what's

02:21:52.660 --> 02:22:00.300
going on let's take a call hi you're on orange launch radio who's this this is

02:22:00.300 --> 02:22:05.380
RPG King 7 up in Canada hello RPGs got in hello yeah I'm super well you you've

02:22:05.380 --> 02:22:09.140
been hammering us all night, so I'm not surprised you got in. No, that's all right. What's on

02:22:09.140 --> 02:22:10.140
your mind, bud?

02:22:10.140 --> 02:22:16.580
Well, I wish I had gotten down to E3. I'm really jealous of you guys that you got up,

02:22:16.580 --> 02:22:21.460
got to go there, but you live on the west coast. I'm out here on the east coast.

02:22:21.460 --> 02:22:25.780
Well, here it is. If you want to know what E3 is like, you're up in Canada, right?

02:22:25.780 --> 02:22:26.780
Yeah.

02:22:26.780 --> 02:22:30.300
Start walking to L.A., and when you get to L.A., you'll know what it feels like to be

02:22:30.300 --> 02:22:33.300
at E3.

02:22:33.300 --> 02:22:37.580
Because you do nothing but walk around all day and occasionally stopping to play a video

02:22:37.580 --> 02:22:38.580
game.

02:22:38.580 --> 02:22:45.660
Okay, well, first thing I wanted to ask about is Castlevania Dawn of Sorrow for the DS.

02:22:45.660 --> 02:22:46.660
Yes.

02:22:46.660 --> 02:22:50.340
Well, what did you find out there or did you find anything out?

02:22:50.340 --> 02:22:54.020
They had a demo running and I think it was actually, I think the game's pretty much complete.

02:22:54.020 --> 02:22:55.740
I think it's going to be released almost imminently.

02:22:55.740 --> 02:22:57.140
I did check it out.

02:22:57.140 --> 02:23:01.700
It's pretty neat because what you get to do is it looks like Symphony of the Night.

02:23:01.700 --> 02:23:02.700
It looks amazing.

02:23:02.700 --> 02:23:06.620
Sound, I couldn't tell you because you can't hear a damn thing inside E3.

02:23:06.620 --> 02:23:08.860
But it looks very similar to Symphony of the Night.

02:23:08.860 --> 02:23:12.320
Basically you play on the bottom part of the screen and the top part of the screen is typically

02:23:12.320 --> 02:23:15.580
what would have been your sub-screen in Symphony of the Night.

02:23:15.580 --> 02:23:18.420
You can flip it back and forth though between that and your map.

02:23:18.420 --> 02:23:21.660
So that's kind of cool because I think that's sort of the type of game that DS was really

02:23:21.660 --> 02:23:23.540
made for.

02:23:23.540 --> 02:23:28.700
what you do is as you move through the game, when you get to certain points, you discover

02:23:28.700 --> 02:23:33.300
these magic seals, and the magic seals are what you're supposed to do to defeat the boss.

02:23:33.300 --> 02:23:37.660
So like the first one was very easy. The first magic seal in the demo I played was just a

02:23:37.660 --> 02:23:42.420
little V shape. You just draw a V, okay? So it teaches you how to draw the seal, and then

02:23:42.420 --> 02:23:46.480
what happens is when you go and fight the boss, when you beat the boss, the seal flies

02:23:46.480 --> 02:23:50.380
up on the screen and you have to draw the seal like you learned it. And if you don't

02:23:50.380 --> 02:23:56.380
If you don't do it, you don't beat the boss, and I think you have to do it all over.

02:23:56.380 --> 02:23:59.380
That actually sounds pretty cool, yeah. Nice use of the stylus.

02:23:59.380 --> 02:24:05.380
Yeah, and I think it's using the stylus without being kind of cheesy about it, like a lot of DS games to date have been.

02:24:05.380 --> 02:24:12.380
I think this will satisfy a lot of folks that have been wanting some new Castlevania that looks more like Symphony of the Night.

02:24:12.380 --> 02:24:19.380
This falls right along with the Castlevania Advance games. I think this will be a great addition to the series.

02:24:19.380 --> 02:24:22.380
And it continues the storyline of Aria of Sorrow as well, so.

02:24:22.380 --> 02:24:25.380
Yeah, which is really cool, because Aria of Sorrow is one of my favorite ones.

02:24:25.380 --> 02:24:29.380
Ah, and something the chat room is saying is actually due out at the end of October.

02:24:29.380 --> 02:24:31.380
I would have guessed that it would have been out a lot sooner,

02:24:31.380 --> 02:24:34.380
because the game looked almost complete from what we saw,

02:24:34.380 --> 02:24:37.380
but I guess it wasn't, but it looked pretty well done,

02:24:37.380 --> 02:24:40.380
so maybe they're just waiting on it, I don't know.

02:24:40.380 --> 02:24:45.380
Yeah, I was excited to hear that 1998 and Into the Heat and the Night

02:24:45.380 --> 02:24:47.380
are going to be on Xtreme 2, because those are, hands down,

02:24:47.380 --> 02:24:51.380
Two of my favorite songs on the Arcade Mixes, Extreme and Fifth Mix.

02:24:51.380 --> 02:24:53.380
I'm really excited to hear those are going to be on it.

02:24:53.380 --> 02:24:56.380
Yeah, you could hear the giant hooray.

02:24:56.380 --> 02:24:58.380
Well, it was kind of a mixed reaction.

02:24:58.380 --> 02:25:01.380
It was a hooray and dope kind of coming from the crowd

02:25:01.380 --> 02:25:03.380
when you saw that In the Heat of the Night was on Extreme 2.

02:25:03.380 --> 02:25:05.380
You know, because the people that like Erotic,

02:25:05.380 --> 02:25:06.380
yay, you know, finally we get Erotic.

02:25:06.380 --> 02:25:09.380
And then the other people that hate Erotic are like, nah.

02:25:09.380 --> 02:25:12.380
But I, for one, am happy about it, so.

02:25:12.380 --> 02:25:15.380
Okay, I also want to ask you about Phantasy Star Universe.

02:25:15.380 --> 02:25:17.340
I'm sure you've covered a lot of this on the podcast.

02:25:17.340 --> 02:25:19.460
I've only gotten to listen to the Wednesday podcast.

02:25:19.460 --> 02:25:20.460
A little bit.

02:25:20.460 --> 02:25:23.660
We talked about it a little bit.

02:25:23.660 --> 02:25:24.940
I played one of them.

02:25:24.940 --> 02:25:26.660
I think it was Fantasy Star Universe I played.

02:25:26.660 --> 02:25:28.660
I heard they were showing another one in the Sega Theater.

02:25:28.660 --> 02:25:29.160
I don't know.

02:25:29.160 --> 02:25:32.820
But I did play Fantasy Star Universe a little bit.

02:25:32.820 --> 02:25:35.520
It's very different from the online,

02:25:35.520 --> 02:25:40.540
like the way it moves is very different, a lot more action

02:25:40.540 --> 02:25:43.420
packed, I think, than the previous Fantasy Star Online,

02:25:43.420 --> 02:25:44.540
at least the one I played.

02:25:44.540 --> 02:25:49.620
I actually did a fight with a dragon, and I was playing with three other computer-controlled

02:25:49.620 --> 02:25:53.540
players, and I really couldn't get a sense of whether this one was supposed to be online

02:25:53.540 --> 02:25:58.280
or what the deal is, but the party I had was computer-controlled, and we were all just

02:25:58.280 --> 02:26:03.300
beating up on this thing, and it was pretty challenging.

02:26:03.300 --> 02:26:09.820
A lot more action-packed than I think the Phantasy Star Online was.

02:26:09.820 --> 02:26:11.140
Just kind of different.

02:26:11.140 --> 02:26:13.380
Don't go into it expecting Phantasy Star Online 2.

02:26:13.380 --> 02:26:16.120
They've changed some things in it a little bit.

02:26:16.120 --> 02:26:17.120
But I liked it.

02:26:17.120 --> 02:26:18.860
It was just kind of fast-paced, and I liked that.

02:26:18.860 --> 02:26:21.820
I think there need to be more fast-paced online games.

02:26:21.820 --> 02:26:23.780
Oh, cool.

02:26:23.780 --> 02:26:27.300
Because one thing I've always didn't like about Phantasy Star Online is it's a little

02:26:27.300 --> 02:26:28.300
slow.

02:26:28.300 --> 02:26:30.700
At least in my opinion, it's kind of slow.

02:26:30.700 --> 02:26:33.220
I think you'll be satisfied with Phantasy Star Universe then.

02:26:33.220 --> 02:26:35.460
They've really kind of upped the pace a little bit.

02:26:35.460 --> 02:26:38.620
I also wanted to go with Kingdom Hearts 2.

02:26:38.620 --> 02:26:39.620
Looks amazing.

02:26:39.620 --> 02:26:46.980
following all the games on GameStop and GameTrailers.com, both of them have gotten really good E3 coverage

02:26:46.980 --> 02:26:48.300
over the few days.

02:26:48.300 --> 02:26:52.580
Right, yeah. Kingdom Hearts 2 I checked out as well. Did you play Kingdom Hearts 2 at

02:26:52.580 --> 02:26:53.580
all, Logie?

02:26:53.580 --> 02:26:54.580
No.

02:26:54.580 --> 02:26:58.460
No, he's saying no. Kingdom Hearts 2 I actually played, they had two, actually four levels

02:26:58.460 --> 02:27:04.100
playable in the E3 demo. Two boss battles and two levels, and both were either the Mulan

02:27:04.100 --> 02:27:08.220
levels or the Hercules levels that you could play. The one I chose to play was the Hercules

02:27:08.220 --> 02:27:11.220
and you actually have Auron in your party when you're playing.

02:27:11.220 --> 02:27:14.220
It has this new mode called drive mode,

02:27:14.220 --> 02:27:16.220
where I guess you're building up this meter as you're playing.

02:27:16.220 --> 02:27:18.220
I couldn't really see how it was working,

02:27:18.220 --> 02:27:22.220
but I had not one, but two Squenix reps come up to me and point this mode out.

02:27:22.220 --> 02:27:24.220
Like, you have to try this.

02:27:24.220 --> 02:27:27.220
And I guess what you do in drive is it's kind of similar to,

02:27:27.220 --> 02:27:29.220
think, the overdrive from Final Fantasy VII,

02:27:29.220 --> 02:27:32.220
where for a brief period of time you can be uber powerful.

02:27:32.220 --> 02:27:37.220
Well, what you do is you actually fuse with one of the other characters in your party when you drive.

02:27:37.220 --> 02:27:41.060
So, I actually fused with Auron and I just became this total badass.

02:27:41.060 --> 02:27:44.980
I had like two, I had the Keyblade and another blade and I was just going around wailing

02:27:44.980 --> 02:27:48.220
on everybody, just beating up all these things.

02:27:48.220 --> 02:27:54.060
So, the drive mode is a pretty cool addition as well as now I notice you use the triangle

02:27:54.060 --> 02:27:57.580
button that pops up, like you usually use it to open chests and stuff.

02:27:57.580 --> 02:28:00.820
You use it for more things in this, so kind of interesting.

02:28:00.820 --> 02:28:05.400
So, and the camera didn't bug the hell out of me like it did in Kingdom Hearts 1.

02:28:05.400 --> 02:28:09.080
So I'm actually pretty excited about Kingdom Hearts 2.

02:28:09.080 --> 02:28:11.080
So it looks good.

02:28:11.080 --> 02:28:13.560
Zelda Twilight Princess.

02:28:13.560 --> 02:28:14.560
We have to get it now.

02:28:14.560 --> 02:28:15.560
I don't care.

02:28:15.560 --> 02:28:16.560
We gotta have it now.

02:28:16.560 --> 02:28:18.920
You know, the interesting thing about Zelda Twilight Princess, and as I'm sure you've

02:28:18.920 --> 02:28:23.680
probably heard online one way or another, three hour wait at the show if you wanted

02:28:23.680 --> 02:28:24.680
to see this game.

02:28:24.680 --> 02:28:28.780
You had to wait in a three hour line, and only the first two days they had t-shirts.

02:28:28.780 --> 02:28:32.140
They actually ran out halfway through the third day.

02:28:32.140 --> 02:28:34.560
From what I hear, the game looks phenomenal.

02:28:34.560 --> 02:28:37.880
I did not want to wait in the line.

02:28:37.880 --> 02:28:43.040
All I know is that it is Link that turns into the wolf because we saw an extra clip of that,

02:28:43.040 --> 02:28:45.120
and what can I say?

02:28:45.120 --> 02:28:49.320
It's everything you Zelda fanboys and girls are wanting it to be, and I include myself

02:28:49.320 --> 02:28:50.320
in that.

02:28:50.320 --> 02:28:53.640
I'm looking forward to the game myself.

02:28:53.640 --> 02:28:56.440
It's the game they should have released three years ago if they wanted the GameCube to be

02:28:56.440 --> 02:28:59.520
super successful, but hey, better late than never, right?

02:28:59.520 --> 02:29:00.520
Right.

02:29:00.520 --> 02:29:01.520
All right.

02:29:01.520 --> 02:29:03.520
Well, we're going to let you go so we can get some other calls in, all right?

02:29:03.520 --> 02:29:04.520
Okay, all right.

02:29:04.520 --> 02:29:06.800
No problem. Thanks for calling. Have a good one. Thanks

02:29:07.440 --> 02:29:11.000
All right, so some e3 questions there some various things. I'm actually surprised

02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:16.320
I actually played all the games he called in to ask about because I didn't play that many games

02:29:16.320 --> 02:29:21.720
There was a whole lot there. I didn't see if you guys have any questions. You can give us a call on the skype line

02:29:29.040 --> 02:29:34.400
But it allows you to call us for free. We like free things free. All right, let's go to another call

02:29:34.400 --> 02:29:36.240
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

02:29:36.240 --> 02:29:36.720
Hey, Sky.

02:29:36.720 --> 02:29:37.280
Siggy here.

02:29:37.280 --> 02:29:37.960
Hello, Siggy.

02:29:37.960 --> 02:29:39.160
What's on your mind?

02:29:39.160 --> 02:29:41.920
Well, I'm about to beat Mania USA.

02:29:41.920 --> 02:29:43.920
I knew you'd have something to say about this.

02:29:43.920 --> 02:29:44.680
Yeah.

02:29:44.680 --> 02:29:47.200
Big credits to Jason Enos for that.

02:29:47.200 --> 02:29:47.960
Absolutely.

02:29:47.960 --> 02:29:50.480
You know, I actually had a chance to talk with Jason Enos.

02:29:50.480 --> 02:29:52.360
We didn't get an interview with him this year.

02:29:52.360 --> 02:29:54.760
I talked to him off the record about some things.

02:29:54.760 --> 02:29:56.320
I don't want to talk about everything

02:29:56.320 --> 02:29:58.000
we talked about on air.

02:29:58.000 --> 02:30:01.040
But one thing I mentioned was that, you know what?

02:30:01.040 --> 02:30:01.920
Way to go.

02:30:01.920 --> 02:30:03.960
I'm so happy that B Manian is here.

02:30:03.960 --> 02:30:06.120
and you're going to make a lot of people very happy with this.

02:30:06.120 --> 02:30:09.240
And his response to me was something like, yeah, well,

02:30:09.240 --> 02:30:10.960
you know, I've been trying for six years,

02:30:10.960 --> 02:30:11.920
and it's finally here.

02:30:11.920 --> 02:30:13.720
So I'm happy, too.

02:30:13.720 --> 02:30:16.960
So absolutely, send Jason Enos some flowers

02:30:16.960 --> 02:30:20.520
if you kids are happy about this, because this is great.

02:30:20.520 --> 02:30:21.260
Yeah.

02:30:21.260 --> 02:30:25.440
And when I saw the song list for Five Piece,

02:30:25.440 --> 02:30:27.800
oh, old school beat mania.

02:30:27.800 --> 02:30:31.360
Is that not a cool feature for us in the US to have?

02:30:31.360 --> 02:30:32.080
Is that not cool?

02:30:32.080 --> 02:30:33.000
Oh, hell yes.

02:30:33.000 --> 02:30:39.800
I mean, what a way to acknowledge the American audience and the fact that, okay, yeah, you

02:30:39.800 --> 02:30:43.640
missed some things in Japan, but we're going to give this to you and it will allow you

02:30:43.640 --> 02:30:48.440
to catch up and maybe, you know, hey, you know, might make some of the Japanese players

02:30:48.440 --> 02:30:49.440
a little jealous.

02:30:49.440 --> 02:30:51.680
Hey, we get to play five key songs in a 2DX interface.

02:30:51.680 --> 02:30:53.640
That's kind of cool.

02:30:53.640 --> 02:30:54.640
Little bit.

02:30:54.640 --> 02:30:55.640
It's a little bit.

02:30:55.640 --> 02:31:10.640
Yeah, I recently saw a picture on GDR Freak. Someone posted the greetings for some Light 7 song, and like 167,000 points for a AAA. That's kind of ridiculous.

02:31:10.640 --> 02:31:17.640
You know, I, again, I wouldn't, I heard of that too and I saw that picture as well, and I AAA'd a song as well.

02:31:17.640 --> 02:31:28.640
I wouldn't take those ranking things as gospel just yet. It is an early build. The thing was stuck in beginner mode, really, even though it didn't look like it.

02:31:28.640 --> 02:31:34.840
Yeah, I don't know how much they're going to futz with the grading system.

02:31:34.840 --> 02:31:36.360
It's too early to tell.

02:31:36.360 --> 02:31:40.560
I kind of would think they wouldn't touch it at all, and maybe just the fact that they

02:31:40.560 --> 02:31:45.980
were doing what they did by putting the beginner songs in there was what caused those mathematical

02:31:45.980 --> 02:31:49.600
things to come up with triple A's and what have you.

02:31:49.600 --> 02:31:50.800
But we'll see.

02:31:50.800 --> 02:31:52.120
I don't really know.

02:31:52.120 --> 02:31:56.580
It's too early to tell with the grades, but I wouldn't assume that they're going to dumb

02:31:56.580 --> 02:32:03.340
it down just yet yeah so we'll see let me you know let me correct you some of

02:32:03.340 --> 02:32:08.020
the pronunciation yes just only one song pronunciation it's a la bossa nova de

02:32:08.020 --> 02:32:11.860
Fabian yes yeah thank you you know I'm horrible pronunciation la bossa nova de

02:32:11.860 --> 02:32:17.540
Fabian I need to get my French there you go all right in a shining Polaris you

02:32:17.540 --> 02:32:21.340
know Polaris and a polarity are the same I don't say Polaris I don't know why I

02:32:21.340 --> 02:32:24.340
I think a polarium or something, I don't know.

02:32:24.340 --> 02:32:26.340
It has something to do with polarity.

02:32:26.340 --> 02:32:28.340
It's a potato-potato thing, though, I think.

02:32:28.340 --> 02:32:30.340
Yeah.

02:32:30.340 --> 02:32:34.340
Anything else you want to share? Other E3 things? Observations?

02:32:34.340 --> 02:32:37.340
Well, just only Beatmania. I'm just happy with that.

02:32:37.340 --> 02:32:42.340
I know. A lot of us people that have been 2DX fans for a long time,

02:32:42.340 --> 02:32:44.340
and I've just been a casual 2DX fan,

02:32:44.340 --> 02:32:46.340
a lot of you guys are being very hardcore,

02:32:46.340 --> 02:32:48.340
a lot more hardcore than I am.

02:32:48.340 --> 02:32:50.340
I think this is great that you guys are finally getting this.

02:32:50.340 --> 02:32:54.700
getting this you know all of us are are getting this

02:32:54.700 --> 02:32:58.380
what i haven't really been checking a whole lot of web forums and stuff what

02:32:58.380 --> 02:33:02.940
is the reaction to this been has it been overwhelmingly positive like about time

02:33:02.940 --> 02:33:05.740
or are the skeptics already ready to

02:33:05.740 --> 02:33:07.140
set fire to this next

02:33:07.140 --> 02:33:10.180
what do you think that you know i haven't been reading you know on both of

02:33:10.180 --> 02:33:14.060
your pick and money style there have been you know like mixed reactions

02:33:14.060 --> 02:33:16.820
but mostly leaning towards a positive side

02:33:16.820 --> 02:33:45.820
That, you know, it's surprisingly enough, and I hate saying this, but it really, that does kind of surprise me because I figured most of the fanboys would be ready to tear into this, but I think by Konami keeping this a secret as long as they did, what they were able to do with this is that they were actually able to kind of set the standard the way they wanted to by unveiling this at E3 and showing us all these cool new features.

02:33:45.820 --> 02:33:50.620
think if they had announced this a month ago and said we are going to show this at E3,

02:33:50.620 --> 02:33:54.500
and I think this is the reason why this didn't happen, people would have made up what they

02:33:54.500 --> 02:33:59.520
wanted to be in the game, and they would have been disappointed when they didn't get that.

02:33:59.520 --> 02:34:03.500
So I think by Konami unveiling it, you know, by keeping it a secret and then unveiling

02:34:03.500 --> 02:34:06.660
it at the very end and showing this is what you are going to get, look at all these amazing

02:34:06.660 --> 02:34:10.500
things, it kind of curved that a little bit, and I think it kind of helped the reaction

02:34:10.500 --> 02:34:11.500
overall.

02:34:11.500 --> 02:34:14.040
So I can't blame Konami at all for trying to keep this a secret, and they did.

02:34:14.040 --> 02:34:19.480
This obviously has been worked on for quite some time, and actually, something we were

02:34:19.480 --> 02:34:23.480
actually clued in on, but we wanted to keep it a secret, but I can talk about it now.

02:34:23.480 --> 02:34:27.800
I gave you guys a hint last week about it, though, but actually, Konami registered the

02:34:27.800 --> 02:34:31.080
patent for Beatmania some time ago in the U.S.

02:34:31.080 --> 02:34:32.080
Oh, I read that.

02:34:32.080 --> 02:34:33.080
I read that.

02:34:33.080 --> 02:34:34.080
Yeah, yeah.

02:34:34.080 --> 02:34:42.000
So, somebody had asked me to talk about it on this show, but kind of knowing that Konami,

02:34:42.000 --> 02:34:45.340
if they were going to put out this game, would want to keep it a secret, I decided, you know,

02:34:45.340 --> 02:34:48.800
we should, or we all decided really, that we should just kind of wait and see what happens

02:34:48.800 --> 02:34:55.800
with it, because otherwise people will just start making stuff up. So, um, it's a good

02:34:56.560 --> 02:35:03.560
thing. Well, anything else you want to share? Well, nothing much else. I just want to share

02:35:05.920 --> 02:35:10.800
something, one of our comments in the chatroom, MPQ says, no matter how much it sucks, buy

02:35:10.800 --> 02:35:14.800
Just so Konami knows, people will buy Beatmania here.

02:35:14.800 --> 02:35:19.800
Oh yeah, about the controller, you know, the US release of the controller,

02:35:19.800 --> 02:35:25.800
were you the one who mentioned like some improvements that would happen?

02:35:25.800 --> 02:35:32.800
Rumors abound that there will be improvements to help curb the sticky key thing that goes on,

02:35:32.800 --> 02:35:34.800
but nothing is set in stone yet.

02:35:34.800 --> 02:35:38.800
But we do know they will release their own controllers here stateside.

02:35:38.800 --> 02:35:43.800
The ones they showed at E3 were simply 2DX controllers from Japan, which, you know, makes sense.

02:35:43.800 --> 02:35:48.800
The DDR with Mario and Matt was the same thing they have in Japan too, so...

02:35:48.800 --> 02:35:54.800
I think we will see some improvements made to the controller, because they're gonna have to redo the controller anyway

02:35:54.800 --> 02:36:00.800
to get the 2DX logo off the turntable, so why not fix the sticky key thing while you're at it?

02:36:00.800 --> 02:36:03.800
I would say that we're gonna see some improvements.

02:36:03.800 --> 02:36:13.800
It would be nice if they put micro switches on it, like cheap micro switches, not exactly from the arcade type of micro switches, to prevent the sticking.

02:36:13.800 --> 02:36:18.800
That's an interesting thought, completely changed the way that the buttons kind of, the sensor system basically.

02:36:18.800 --> 02:36:23.800
So, that would be interesting, I'd be interested to see that.

02:36:23.800 --> 02:36:28.800
Yeah, and if they do put micro switches, I would buy it, I would buy it definitely.

02:36:28.800 --> 02:36:34.280
All right, yeah, I think what's interesting is that a lot of it, you know, and I need

02:36:34.280 --> 02:36:40.320
a new 2DX controller very badly for my import copies, but now that I've heard that Beat

02:36:40.320 --> 02:36:44.500
Mania is coming out in the USA, I'm just kind of going to wait for the U.S. controllers

02:36:44.500 --> 02:36:47.560
to come out, because there's no sense of paying $100 to import a controller now when they're

02:36:47.560 --> 02:36:52.600
going to release them here, probably $40, $50, much, I don't know, don't take my word

02:36:52.600 --> 02:36:53.600
on that.

02:36:53.600 --> 02:36:55.960
I mean, who knows how much these things are going to cost, but it will be cheaper than

02:36:55.960 --> 02:36:57.720
importing it, that's for sure.

02:36:57.720 --> 02:37:12.720
Yeah, and speaking of BeatMe and setting that aside, about PlayStation 3, I read from either IGN or GameSpot that they have six USB ports, which is, you know, like, are they really replacing the old controller port for that?

02:37:12.720 --> 02:37:15.720
I didn't read up on PS3. What do you know about PS3?

02:37:15.720 --> 02:37:20.720
It had a lot of USB ports. I know just for the pictures of it, it's got a buttload of...

02:37:20.720 --> 02:37:23.720
Well, it's also got a bunch of weird things to it.

02:37:23.720 --> 02:37:29.720
For one, it's got two HDTV outs on it, so you can actually have two HDTV setups.

02:37:29.720 --> 02:37:33.720
One for the actual game plan, one for, like, almost like a dual screen...

02:37:33.720 --> 02:37:34.720
Like a DS, basically.

02:37:34.720 --> 02:37:36.720
Like a DS, yeah.

02:37:36.720 --> 02:37:43.680
It's gonna have, I saw three Ethernet ports on there, now I don't know what the hell that's

02:37:43.680 --> 02:37:48.440
about either, but it's just a lot of weird stuff on there, and I'm actually pulling up

02:37:48.440 --> 02:37:56.240
the picture right now for my reference, but I remember also, I don't know, it just looked

02:37:56.240 --> 02:38:00.120
interesting, and I know that it's gonna be Wi-Fi as well, but I don't see why you need

02:38:00.120 --> 02:38:03.840
so many damn USB ports, but then again, I don't know why you need so many damn USB ports

02:38:03.840 --> 02:38:04.840
on a computer.

02:38:04.840 --> 02:38:09.060
going to be that we do know that every next-gen system is going to be wireless and their controllers

02:38:09.060 --> 02:38:13.800
and stuff, so I kind of assume that the USB ports are for four for controllers and two

02:38:13.800 --> 02:38:16.960
for whatever USB stuff you want to put in.

02:38:16.960 --> 02:38:22.920
Well, here's a good shot of the back here right now, and I see, I count them, three

02:38:22.920 --> 02:38:28.640
Ethernet ports, two USB ports, the AV out, which is like, you know, your standard AV

02:38:28.640 --> 02:38:34.480
out, the digital audio out, the two HDTV outs, that's only on the back, then you've got,

02:38:34.480 --> 02:38:38.340
And I honestly don't know why there's three ethernet ports, that makes no sense to me,

02:38:38.340 --> 02:38:40.080
but whatever.

02:38:40.080 --> 02:38:45.960
And then as far as front ports go, I remember there's at least a couple USB ports that are

02:38:45.960 --> 02:38:49.960
underneath this like little cover thing on the front.

02:38:49.960 --> 02:38:54.980
I'm trying to see if I can get a picture here, but anyways, yeah, so there's like a ton of

02:38:54.980 --> 02:38:55.980
stuff on there.

02:38:55.980 --> 02:38:58.400
I don't know why, but I'm sure they've got a reason for it.

02:38:58.400 --> 02:39:01.820
I think, okay, you have to remember with the next-gen systems too what everybody is doing,

02:39:01.820 --> 02:39:02.820
not just Microsoft.

02:39:02.820 --> 02:39:05.500
Microsoft's kind of been saying they're going to do this.

02:39:05.500 --> 02:39:08.740
They're going to expand and not just be about gaming, right?

02:39:08.740 --> 02:39:12.580
Microsoft wants to be an entertainment center where you can download music and do things

02:39:12.580 --> 02:39:13.580
like that.

02:39:13.580 --> 02:39:15.900
So I think you're going to see us on a lot of the next-gen systems that there's more

02:39:15.900 --> 02:39:20.160
things to plug in there for your media setup at home than just your controllers.

02:39:20.160 --> 02:39:22.260
And I think that's kind of what this is all about on PS3.

02:39:22.260 --> 02:39:26.740
Yeah, and then I saw, you know, and then I read they're going to replace memory cards

02:39:26.740 --> 02:39:29.900
with the memory stick duos for, you know, like a...

02:39:29.900 --> 02:39:31.420
I don't think they would do that.

02:39:31.420 --> 02:39:33.300
probably use speed drives of anything.

02:39:33.300 --> 02:39:34.140
Oh, who knows?

02:39:34.140 --> 02:39:35.820
We'll see.

02:39:35.820 --> 02:39:37.780
All right, Siggy, we're going to let you go so we can just

02:39:37.780 --> 02:39:39.380
get to some other stuff on the show.

02:39:39.380 --> 02:39:39.700
Yeah.

02:39:39.700 --> 02:39:41.180
But have a good one, buddy, OK?

02:39:41.180 --> 02:39:41.980
All right, later.

02:39:41.980 --> 02:39:42.980
Later.

02:39:42.980 --> 02:39:45.780
I do know what some of those USB ports are going to be used for.

02:39:45.780 --> 02:39:47.980
Interfacing with your PSP.

02:39:47.980 --> 02:39:50.220
Yeah, well, that and wireless is going to be what's

02:39:50.220 --> 02:39:51.140
going to be poor, too.

02:39:51.140 --> 02:39:52.100
You can bet on that.

02:39:52.100 --> 02:39:53.820
Can you guys imagine a member of the pocket station?

02:39:53.820 --> 02:39:56.220
Yeah, but I've met most of you that don't remember that.

02:39:56.220 --> 02:39:58.500
But that's what they're going to do, and we'll see.

02:39:58.500 --> 02:40:00.900
All right, what we're going to do now is we're

02:40:00.900 --> 02:40:04.500
actually not tonight going to have a cage match. We actually kind of ran out of time

02:40:04.500 --> 02:40:08.840
and also, even though DarkSakara was able to send me her file, we're just running out

02:40:08.840 --> 02:40:12.040
of time. We don't have time to do it. We figured you guys would want to know the E3 coverage

02:40:12.040 --> 02:40:18.700
more than that. So, we'll table the cage match to next week, but we can't possibly get through

02:40:18.700 --> 02:40:24.400
a show without doing some FUs of the week. So, let's get into the FUs of the week if

02:40:24.400 --> 02:40:32.800
we can here. Loki, I did get some from Jamie, so I'll go ahead and start off with hers,

02:40:32.800 --> 02:40:38.040
FUs of the Week here. So, here we go. If you guys want to send in your FUs of the Week,

02:40:38.040 --> 02:40:41.840
send a private message to Skye in the chat room. And after the FUs of the Week, we'll

02:40:41.840 --> 02:40:47.040
go back to the Skype line and do some Ask Orange Lounge, actually, as well. So, here

02:40:47.040 --> 02:40:52.200
we go, the FUs of the Week. Why is it, Loki, that we do the FUs of the Week? Because we

02:40:52.200 --> 02:40:53.200
Well, we have to.

02:40:53.200 --> 02:40:54.200
Alright.

02:40:54.200 --> 02:41:08.920
Dark Sakura would like to say an F.U. to drama and sunburns and the fast pass being turned

02:41:08.920 --> 02:41:12.200
off for Roger Rabbit.

02:41:12.200 --> 02:41:13.200
Alright.

02:41:13.200 --> 02:41:16.200
Loki, your F.U.s of the week.

02:41:16.200 --> 02:41:24.040
My first F.U. goes to Audioslave for having this giant concert in the middle of Hollywood

02:41:24.040 --> 02:41:27.400
and Highlands, and that really sucked.

02:41:27.400 --> 02:41:37.640
And also, fuck you to E3, or mainly just the convention hall, for stopping accepting credit

02:41:37.640 --> 02:41:40.020
cards after a certain time.

02:41:40.020 --> 02:41:43.560
And it's like during the middle of lunch rush, they're just like, yeah, we just don't want

02:41:43.560 --> 02:41:54.560
We're gonna do credit cards, we're gonna do cash only. Of course you don't realize that until after you've gotten your food so you're fucked if you don't have, uh, cash. Luckily I've, you know, had cash so that was no problem.

02:41:54.560 --> 02:42:06.560
Um, and basically also fuck you to Motel 6 for their crappy beds cause they're just uncomfortable as hell. And, um, yeah, that's pretty much it.

02:42:06.560 --> 02:42:14.560
Fuck you to Rockstar for not actually showing any of their games and wasting a big space in E3.

02:42:14.560 --> 02:42:20.560
And also to Nintendo for not having a revolution there because I wanted to see that.

02:42:20.560 --> 02:42:24.560
That's it. My turn.

02:42:24.560 --> 02:42:35.400
F you to that bitch at Konami's booth, not working there, somebody who is an observer,

02:42:35.400 --> 02:42:40.260
that said I tried to dig my nails into her over a t-shirt and she whined and complained

02:42:40.260 --> 02:42:42.560
like a little baby and got her boyfriend mad at me.

02:42:42.560 --> 02:42:46.600
I was so stunned that somebody would be so trite that I didn't even know what to say

02:42:46.600 --> 02:42:47.600
back.

02:42:47.600 --> 02:42:51.540
But if I could say anything back, I would say something along these lines.

02:42:51.540 --> 02:42:56.820
Your girlfriend is lying to you about me digging my nails into her, she is making it up.

02:42:56.820 --> 02:43:02.520
She's probably lying to you about being monogamous with you as well.

02:43:02.520 --> 02:43:06.720
So screw you lady and stupid boyfriend, how dare you call me an asshole.

02:43:06.720 --> 02:43:11.160
I wish my posse was there to beat you up.

02:43:11.160 --> 02:43:17.880
Also I'd like to give an F you to $8 hamburgers at E3 that aren't even that good.

02:43:17.880 --> 02:43:21.920
having to wait in line for 45 minutes I'm not even kidding 45 minutes to get a

02:43:21.920 --> 02:43:27.800
freaking hamburger it's horrible so an F you to the fact that the next two days

02:43:27.800 --> 02:43:33.000
I had to eat lunch at 1030 if I wanted to avoid lines horrible and even then we

02:43:33.000 --> 02:43:35.760
had to wait like what 15 minutes for a pizza that one day because I kept

02:43:35.760 --> 02:43:40.320
dropping them yeah the second day we got pizza dumb bitch there didn't even

02:43:40.320 --> 02:43:44.160
understand how to cook pizza which was quite funny because I love just watching

02:44:14.160 --> 02:44:19.620
MPQ says F you to my wireless mouse the receiver broke now I have this mouse

02:44:19.620 --> 02:44:22.700
that works perfectly except for the fact that it can't be plugged into the

02:44:22.700 --> 02:44:27.100
computer also an F you to shaza on the money style you're being a retard you're

02:44:27.100 --> 02:44:32.540
pissing everyone off stop being stupid or go away I avoid web form drama very

02:44:32.540 --> 02:44:39.420
much so I don't know what to tell you on that one um let's see next step you comes

02:44:39.420 --> 02:44:45.580
from Ronchan. F you to my job for cutting my hours again. Screw you guys, I'm going

02:44:45.580 --> 02:44:55.320
to an amazement this weekend. Miklatov says F you to moving, the end. And illusion says

02:44:55.320 --> 02:45:01.060
F you to the never ending star testing that was stretched over this entire month. It's

02:45:01.060 --> 02:45:04.780
still not done. F you to in the groove being pushed back, though they say it doesn't have

02:45:04.780 --> 02:45:08.380
to do with the lawsuit and by they I mean VX Jason XB.

02:45:08.380 --> 02:45:12.860
Illusion if you've been listening earlier in the show, I talked to a Red Octane rep

02:45:12.860 --> 02:45:15.500
and they said it doesn't have anything to do with the lawsuit.

02:45:15.500 --> 02:45:18.860
FU to no cage match, oh screw you.

02:45:18.860 --> 02:45:21.740
There is so time left, there's an hour left in the show.

02:45:21.740 --> 02:45:27.460
I don't know what clock you're looking at but I see there's 15 minutes left.

02:45:27.460 --> 02:45:29.500
And god we're not in that time zone.

02:45:29.500 --> 02:45:32.780
Crouton 6 says FU to Loki for hating in the groove.

02:45:32.780 --> 02:45:36.780
Oh yeah, well fuck in the groove for sucking.

02:45:36.780 --> 02:45:41.780
Darkknight says, F you to early morning meetings at work and poor road trip planning.

02:45:41.780 --> 02:45:45.780
Having to schedule some time off for a racing event that was actually moved to next weekend.

02:45:45.780 --> 02:45:50.780
And having to work Saturday, missing the cookout of cookouts. Damn you to hell, Job!

02:45:52.780 --> 02:45:57.780
Rychan says, F you to cheap power supplies that die on Friday the 13th. Ooh, that's a sign.

02:45:57.780 --> 02:46:02.780
Yeah, the power supply sucked. I guess so. Alright, that's it. That's all the FUs we got.

02:46:02.780 --> 02:46:07.780
So, there you have it. Oh, one more. One late one that just came in. Lemon Line Jump.

02:46:07.780 --> 02:46:12.780
FU to myself for making myself sick. I ruined my own Monday.

02:46:12.780 --> 02:46:17.780
How do you ruin your own Monday? Alright.

02:46:17.780 --> 02:46:22.780
I guess what we're going to do

02:46:22.780 --> 02:46:26.860
is do a quick break, then we'll come back and do some Ask Orange Lounge

02:46:26.860 --> 02:46:31.660
because I'm sure you guys have some questions after E3. And to make Loki

02:46:31.660 --> 02:46:36.340
very happy with me, I think what we'll actually do in this break is play some music from

02:46:36.340 --> 02:46:36.860
In the Groove.

02:46:36.860 --> 02:46:42.260
Whatever, I don't care. So we'll be back after this quick break, just a couple

02:46:42.260 --> 02:46:43.620
songs here, and then we're going to do some

02:46:43.620 --> 02:46:47.760
Ask Orange Lounge. So send your questions over to Skye in the chat room, and we'll be back

02:46:47.760 --> 02:46:54.760
after this.

02:47:17.760 --> 02:47:28.760
There will be like a fire in the sky for me

02:47:28.760 --> 02:47:36.760
Finding your way to my home, my body

02:47:36.760 --> 02:48:04.760
Free like a bird in the sky

02:48:34.760 --> 02:48:36.760
Come play with me

02:49:06.760 --> 02:49:13.760
We made the last step, we're ready to go We made the last step, we're ready to go

02:49:36.760 --> 02:49:39.760
Please remember not to suffer after forty minutes that's the end of ever

02:49:39.760 --> 02:49:43.760
Please remember not summer after forty minutes that's the end of ever

02:49:43.760 --> 02:49:44.760
Please remember not summer after forty minutes that's the end of ever

02:49:44.760 --> 02:49:45.760
Please remember not summer after forty minutes that's the end of ever

02:49:45.760 --> 02:49:45.760
Please remember not summer after forty minutes that's the end of ever

02:49:45.760 --> 02:49:46.260
Please remember not summer after forty minutes that's the end of ever

02:49:46.260 --> 02:49:51.760
Please remember not summer after forty minutes that's the end of ever

02:49:51.760 --> 02:49:53.760
Please remember not summer after forty minutes that's the end of ever

02:49:53.760 --> 02:49:55.760
I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready

02:50:53.760 --> 02:51:04.480
After this song, we'll be having a Let Them Move marathon.

02:51:04.480 --> 02:51:05.480
Nooooooo!

02:51:05.480 --> 02:51:07.640
Just kidding.

02:51:07.640 --> 02:51:11.160
Orange Lounge Radio, crap-free Bhavani radio.

02:51:11.160 --> 02:51:15.900
Hello, we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio Live, wrapping things up here with a little

02:51:15.900 --> 02:51:17.040
bit of Ask Orange Lounge.

02:51:17.040 --> 02:51:23.100
In that break, you heard some In the Groove music, Nina with Fly With Me and Mind Reflection

02:51:23.100 --> 02:51:27.400
with Remember December was that last one. That's a fan favorite, believe it or not.

02:51:27.400 --> 02:51:32.100
I do not care for that song at all, but the fans asked me to play it, so I do. So there

02:51:32.100 --> 02:51:35.640
you have it. I do like the Fly With Me song, though. I do like that one. I just don't like

02:51:35.640 --> 02:51:42.680
Remember December, personally. Let's get into Ask Orange Lounge, where you guys, the listeners,

02:51:42.680 --> 02:51:46.920
get to control the show by sending us questions, and we answer them. It's just that simple.

02:51:46.920 --> 02:51:53.920
it's really it's really an easy concept honestly

02:51:55.600 --> 02:51:58.760
let's ask orange lounge some stupid question

02:51:58.760 --> 02:52:02.600
what will we find out this week on orange lounge radio

02:52:02.600 --> 02:52:06.320
I hope they have some questions to ask us about E3

02:52:06.320 --> 02:52:09.840
and not so much random stuff this week because that gets annoying

02:52:09.840 --> 02:52:13.800
I like how you add the extra syllable and orange

02:52:13.800 --> 02:52:18.800
Or Eng... Or Enza!

02:52:18.800 --> 02:52:23.800
Look, that's the best thing I gotta do by improvising here.

02:52:23.800 --> 02:52:28.800
Hey, at least you had better grammar than that one distribution company.

02:52:28.800 --> 02:52:36.800
Crouton6 wants to know, is there any known way to hook up my $400 2DX arcade style controller to a freaking PS3?

02:52:36.800 --> 02:52:42.600
Um, if PS3 is backwards compatible, which I believe they have said it will be PS2 and PS1 backwards compatible,

02:52:42.600 --> 02:52:47.980
you can bet that there will be some type of converter that will turn one of the USB ports into a regular controller port.

02:52:47.980 --> 02:52:51.760
Guaranteed. There's gotta be something. I mean, otherwise you can't be backwards compatible, so...

02:52:51.760 --> 02:52:57.400
Well, yes you can, because you can still play the old games with the, um, DualShock sort of controllers.

02:52:57.400 --> 02:53:03.760
But here's the thing, though, what you can do that I know they have this, too, is some sort of Wi-Fi thing that you plug into,

02:53:03.760 --> 02:53:07.240
um, your normal controllers and it's just like, you know, basically...

02:53:07.240 --> 02:53:10.960
There'll be a way.

02:53:10.960 --> 02:53:15.120
Yeah, there'll be a way. There's gotta be something. That's why you need to save your old

02:53:15.120 --> 02:53:16.640
PS2 and don't sell it.

02:53:16.640 --> 02:53:20.840
Uh, Illusion wants to know, were we supposed to set our watches an hour

02:53:20.840 --> 02:53:22.560
forward daylight savings time?

02:53:22.560 --> 02:53:26.400
About three weeks ago that happened, didn't it?

02:53:26.400 --> 02:53:30.920
Spring forward, fall back, right? Yeah, we did that a while ago. What the hell, dude?

02:53:30.920 --> 02:53:34.920
Alright, he says, I wasn't here for the first hour or two hours. I don't know. I'm lost in time.

02:53:34.920 --> 02:53:38.920
I really don't know when I came in. Anyway, can you guys give me a quick summary on what happened?

02:53:38.920 --> 02:53:42.920
Okay, for those of you who joined late,

02:53:42.920 --> 02:53:46.920
we talked about E3 and what we did. Well, actually, no, we can't tell you, but what you

02:53:46.920 --> 02:53:50.920
can do is you can check into the reruns that we play on DDR Freak Radio.

02:53:50.920 --> 02:53:54.920
There you go! Friday! There you go! There you go! Nice plug there. You can listen to

02:53:54.920 --> 02:53:58.920
the rewind on DDR Freak Radio Friday nights. Um, just to sum

02:53:58.920 --> 02:54:03.920
We talked BeatMania, USA, and the DDRs. We played a song that's going to be in DDR Extreme 2.

02:54:03.920 --> 02:54:06.920
And we gave away a million dollars and you didn't win.

02:54:06.920 --> 02:54:10.920
And we played the bootleg copy of the new MIDI head mix from UltraMix 3.

02:54:10.920 --> 02:54:14.920
And what was that song from Extreme 2, Plovotlian Dance and Chorus, something like that?

02:54:14.920 --> 02:54:15.920
I'm not even going to try to pronounce it.

02:54:15.920 --> 02:54:17.920
We played it.

02:54:17.920 --> 02:54:24.920
Darkknight says, Sky, was the G4 bit with you guys for G4tv.com show or another show?

02:54:24.920 --> 02:54:27.920
Where you're going to see it, from what I understand, if they even use it, which I don't know,

02:54:27.920 --> 02:54:36.420
It's G4TV.com, the show, and it's like when they're coming back from commercial, they'll probably show the booth and we're clapping.

02:54:36.420 --> 02:54:41.420
And I'm wearing a bright ass green shirt and a t-shirt, so you can't miss me.

02:54:41.420 --> 02:54:44.420
And then Loki's standing right next to me, and I don't remember what you were wearing that day.

02:54:44.420 --> 02:54:45.420
I don't remember either.

02:54:45.420 --> 02:54:48.420
And Mikotov was standing with us as well, so you could see him too.

02:54:48.420 --> 02:54:55.420
I don't remember, no, I think the last day I wore, it was like a, just a normal shirt.

02:54:55.420 --> 02:54:59.420
But yeah, I had a bag. An Xbox 360 bag.

02:54:59.420 --> 02:55:03.420
I think I had one too. Um, let's see.

02:55:03.420 --> 02:55:07.420
MPQ, should I bother going to episode 3? Do you think it's worth the trouble?

02:55:07.420 --> 02:55:11.420
I haven't seen episode 3. I'm not, like, huge on Star Wars.

02:55:11.420 --> 02:55:15.420
I will see the movie, but I'm gonna wait until the frenzy dies down.

02:55:15.420 --> 02:55:19.420
Yes, it's worth the trouble from what I hear.

02:55:19.420 --> 02:55:23.420
It's what the fans have been looking for. I mean, and also, in other news,

02:55:23.420 --> 02:55:29.420
War of the Worlds is supposed to be what people were expecting for Independence Day and signs.

02:55:29.420 --> 02:55:32.420
In other words, it's not going to disappoint you.

02:55:32.420 --> 02:55:34.420
New trailer online, by the way.

02:55:34.420 --> 02:55:38.420
Oh, really? It looks spiffy. We'll have to look into that.

02:55:38.420 --> 02:55:39.420
Alright, let's see.

02:55:39.420 --> 02:55:50.420
VidPowah, on a scale of 1 sucktastic to 10 fantastic, rate your overall E3 experience.

02:55:50.420 --> 02:55:52.420
I give mine a seven.

02:55:54.420 --> 02:55:56.420
Honestly, I give mine about a six.

02:55:57.420 --> 02:56:02.420
I had a good time overall, but I think I was a little more into it last year than I was.

02:56:02.420 --> 02:56:04.420
It was just too crowded this year, and I was just too tired.

02:56:04.420 --> 02:56:07.420
I had too much other stuff going on, other drama, too, that I don't need to talk about on a radio show.

02:56:07.420 --> 02:56:09.420
It's too much media-only stuff.

02:56:10.420 --> 02:56:15.420
Honestly, if they want just media only coming in there, don't invite everyone else. Just invite the media.

02:56:17.420 --> 02:56:18.420
But invite us, still, please.

02:56:18.420 --> 02:56:21.920
Well, we're media now. Yeah, we're gonna be media next year, we hope.

02:56:21.920 --> 02:56:25.920
Ranchan says, okay, Sky, or Ronchan maybe, sorry.

02:56:25.920 --> 02:56:29.920
Ronchan says, okay, Sky, please explain the ferret, because I'm lost.

02:56:29.920 --> 02:56:31.420
And, so we'll do that.

02:56:31.420 --> 02:56:37.420
Uh, the ferret is basically these little toys that we bought a long time ago.

02:56:37.420 --> 02:56:40.920
No, one of them was given to me as a Christmas present, like, years ago.

02:56:40.920 --> 02:56:42.420
Years ago, before we were even...

02:56:42.420 --> 02:56:44.920
We've been doing Orange Lounge Radio for, like, three years.

02:56:44.920 --> 02:56:47.420
And one of these... Okay, stop it.

02:56:47.420 --> 02:56:51.420
One of those was given to me like three years ago and Jamie found it one show

02:56:51.420 --> 02:56:54.420
like it was sitting on my dresser or something and she started playing with it

02:56:54.420 --> 02:56:56.420
and she was giggling and thought it was the cutest thing ever

02:56:56.420 --> 02:56:59.420
and she hasn't stopped since.

02:56:59.420 --> 02:57:01.420
It was like two years ago.

02:57:01.420 --> 02:57:04.420
And then one day, just to be funny, I bought about six of them.

02:57:04.420 --> 02:57:05.420
Oh, I hate you.

02:57:05.420 --> 02:57:08.420
And I repaired them because they had dead batteries

02:57:08.420 --> 02:57:10.420
so I had to cut them open and repair them

02:57:10.420 --> 02:57:13.420
and then one of them got stuck on the Katamari.

02:57:13.420 --> 02:57:15.420
Where did you find?

02:57:15.420 --> 02:57:19.620
Those they were what people want to buy them. You're not going to find them anywhere. They're called

02:57:20.260 --> 02:57:23.160
Scoosies is what they're called. It's like s see

02:57:24.340 --> 02:57:30.540
Use easy or ie or z ie you can find them on eBay. They're kind of expensive

02:57:31.180 --> 02:57:34.800
But that those are where I found them. I found them at discount toy stores

02:57:34.800 --> 02:57:35.420
basically

02:57:35.420 --> 02:57:36.740
the discount

02:57:36.740 --> 02:57:42.780
Outlet store for KB and I bought what it was left and there was hardly anything left and they were dead

02:57:42.780 --> 02:57:48.060
I like I like Dark Knight summary there. She uses the ferret to annoy sky to death. Yep. You got it

02:57:48.120 --> 02:57:50.120
Yep, you can find them on eBay

02:57:50.480 --> 02:57:55.720
Okay, Ron Chan also wants to know Loki your favorite Nintendo character my favorite Nintendo character

02:57:56.680 --> 02:57:58.680
I

02:57:59.340 --> 02:58:01.340
Don't know

02:58:02.800 --> 02:58:06.280
We'll just say Zelda I get our link link thinks kind of cool

02:58:06.280 --> 02:58:10.720
I don't have a really favorite Nintendo character. Let's let you want to include

02:58:10.720 --> 02:58:18.400
include Super Joe from Bionic Commando, because technically he was on Nintendo.

02:58:18.400 --> 02:58:22.640
My favorite would be, without a doubt, the Eggplant Wizard, but not from the cartoon.

02:58:22.640 --> 02:58:28.540
Not the cartoon Eggplant. That guy was disgusting. The Eggplant Wizard, as portrayed in the original

02:58:28.540 --> 02:58:33.160
8-bit Icarus, was awesome. If not the Eggplant, and that's why they need to make a new kid

02:58:33.160 --> 02:58:37.800
Icarus, please, please Nintendo, pretty, pretty please with sugar on top. I don't care. Put

02:58:37.800 --> 02:58:45.360
on the DS. I don't care. Just make me a new one. King Hippo, a close second. King Hippo

02:58:45.360 --> 02:58:52.340
was a badass. Doobs is asking, what happened with Kingdom Hearts 2? I think it's too late

02:58:52.340 --> 02:58:55.440
for a question. No, you're not too late for a question, but I did talk about Kingdom Hearts

02:58:55.440 --> 02:59:00.920
2 with a previous caller, so I hope you were listening. Again, Kingdom Hearts 2, it's like

02:59:00.920 --> 02:59:04.760
Kingdom Hearts 1, but with a better camera and orans in it, which is very cool.

02:59:04.760 --> 02:59:06.760
And it looks like the graphics are upgraded, too.

02:59:06.760 --> 02:59:08.760
And overdrive mode, or drive mode.

02:59:08.760 --> 02:59:11.760
It's really amazing, actually, what they've done with that engine.

02:59:11.760 --> 02:59:14.760
Like, thousands of characters on the screen at one time.

02:59:14.760 --> 02:59:16.760
You know, it's pretty nice.

02:59:16.760 --> 02:59:20.760
So yeah, pretty awesome game. Definitely get it when it comes in.

02:59:20.760 --> 02:59:22.760
All right.

02:59:22.760 --> 02:59:26.760
And that's it. That's all the questions we got tonight for Ask Orange Lounge.

02:59:26.760 --> 02:59:29.760
So, doo doo doo doo doo doo. I guess that's it.

02:59:29.760 --> 02:59:32.760
Oh, Doobs is confessing he wasn't there. He was gone.

02:59:32.760 --> 02:59:36.960
Oh, that was the best part, too. You just reminded me. Remember when they were having

02:59:36.960 --> 02:59:43.680
all the technical issues with more friends and the one guitarist from the Black Manges

02:59:43.680 --> 02:59:48.160
all doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo on the guitar? That was awesome.

02:59:48.160 --> 02:59:52.660
That was pretty awesome. One other thing I want to mention, this is a question that came

02:59:52.660 --> 02:59:56.320
up way earlier in the show, I want to say it was Dork or somebody in our chat room said

02:59:56.320 --> 03:00:01.560
this, wants to know why on GameSpot when he's looking at all the BeatMania pictures he sees

03:00:01.560 --> 03:00:05.400
these random pictures that have nothing to do with BeatMania. Well let me put it

03:00:05.400 --> 03:00:09.640
this way, this is what happens. A lot of these websites out there, GameSpot, IGN,

03:00:09.640 --> 03:00:14.400
all those big guys, they're lazy and what they do, all they do is they just upload

03:00:14.400 --> 03:00:18.520
everything from the press kit onto their site as screenshots, okay? Now we all do

03:00:18.520 --> 03:00:22.400
it, all of us in the media do it, because the media kit screenshots are all we've

03:00:22.400 --> 03:00:25.600
got to go off of. But what Konami did with their press kit, which is very

03:00:25.600 --> 03:00:30.640
interesting, is they actually included all these concept art pieces or

03:00:30.640 --> 03:00:35.200
fragments of the animations you see in the video. Which I will be using for my own

03:00:35.200 --> 03:00:39.960
reference. Here's the thing, they are in Photoshop format, super high quality. If

03:00:39.960 --> 03:00:43.520
you want to build a website, get your hands one way or another on a Konami

03:00:43.520 --> 03:00:47.940
press kit because they've got these great Beatmania concepts, just the

03:00:47.940 --> 03:00:52.340
industrial things, the spinning things you see, all that stuff. It would also be

03:00:52.340 --> 03:00:58.600
awesome to do with that, to make your own Beatmania skin for Stepmania. I'm not

03:00:58.600 --> 03:01:00.740
doing it. I ain't putting that effort in.

03:01:00.740 --> 03:01:05.320
So that's why you see it in there, because they didn't realize that those were not game

03:01:05.320 --> 03:01:10.240
screenshots, but it's just concept art and pieces. It's for you to use, like if you want

03:01:10.240 --> 03:01:14.860
to make like a BeatMania themed webpage, seriously, that's exactly what it's for. At least my

03:01:14.860 --> 03:01:16.480
impression. So that's kind of cool.

03:01:16.480 --> 03:01:21.380
You know, I'm really sad that none of the trailer videos on there, that they were running

03:01:21.380 --> 03:01:26.320
that little reel, because I wanted that, because the music in it was awesome, and I wanted

03:01:26.320 --> 03:01:28.320
to steal the music.

03:01:28.320 --> 03:01:35.320
This is going to be the last question from our chat room here.

03:01:35.320 --> 03:01:40.320
Multiple people are asking me this, so all you guys want to know.

03:01:40.320 --> 03:01:46.320
Did they ever show Jam with the Band for the Nintendo DS?

03:01:46.320 --> 03:01:48.320
I didn't see it anywhere.

03:01:48.320 --> 03:01:49.320
Nope.

03:01:49.320 --> 03:01:50.320
I didn't see it.

03:01:50.320 --> 03:01:51.320
I didn't see it either.

03:01:51.320 --> 03:01:52.320
I guess they didn't show it.

03:01:52.320 --> 03:01:55.320
Unless I somehow completely missed it, which is possible.

03:01:55.320 --> 03:01:57.320
We did play a music game on Gizmondo.

03:01:57.320 --> 03:01:59.320
Yeah, what was that Gizmondo music game you played real quick?

03:01:59.320 --> 03:02:00.320
I don't remember.

03:02:00.320 --> 03:02:01.320
It was some guitar game.

03:02:01.320 --> 03:02:02.320
It was kind of weird.

03:02:02.320 --> 03:02:07.320
It's like a guitar game, sort of like, I don't even know how to compare it,

03:02:07.320 --> 03:02:11.320
but it's very, it's like a rhythm music game with action game mixed in it.

03:02:11.320 --> 03:02:12.320
It was kind of weird.

03:02:12.320 --> 03:02:13.320
Dark Sakura actually played it a little more.

03:02:13.320 --> 03:02:15.320
Maybe she could fill you in on it next week.

03:02:15.320 --> 03:02:16.320
Don't forget to ask.

03:02:16.320 --> 03:02:17.320
Last, last one real quick.

03:02:17.320 --> 03:02:19.320
Doobs wants to know, if you didn't talk about this already,

03:02:19.320 --> 03:02:21.320
what happened with the Katamari?

03:02:21.320 --> 03:02:22.320
We don't know.

03:02:22.320 --> 03:02:23.320
We imagine they rolled it out the door.

03:02:23.320 --> 03:02:26.040
It's probably sitting in Namco's big office somewhere.

03:02:26.040 --> 03:02:27.160
They probably think it's funny.

03:02:27.160 --> 03:02:28.120
But our media sampler's on there.

03:02:28.120 --> 03:02:30.960
Our media sampler's on there, and then a few inches away, the ferret.

03:02:30.960 --> 03:02:34.280
Yeah, so kind of funny.

03:02:34.280 --> 03:02:36.240
Which we'll have pictures of that online soon, hopefully.

03:02:36.240 --> 03:02:36.920
It'll be interesting.

03:02:36.920 --> 03:02:38.880
I'd be curious to know what they are going to do with that katamari.

03:02:38.880 --> 03:02:44.120
Oh, I did check out my camera and the pictures that it took, and they all suck.

03:02:44.120 --> 03:02:49.680
So not much in, pretty much everything that we have that I took a picture of, we have a

03:02:49.680 --> 03:02:51.160
better copy in the press kit.

03:02:51.160 --> 03:02:57.160
Jamie said something. Jamie said something that she took something like 600 pictures.

03:02:57.160 --> 03:03:03.160
It's insane. Oh Lord. I took like 70 or 80 at most. She took like 600.

03:03:03.160 --> 03:03:07.160
I took 117. I deleted most of them. Oh! You know what else I want to say?

03:03:07.160 --> 03:03:13.160
Hello to our French listeners, if any folks from France. You know that I actually sent some of my pictures a couple days ago to that.

03:03:13.160 --> 03:03:18.160
Remember I had like a misrouted email from some French Nintendo site and now I've been talking to the guy?

03:03:18.160 --> 03:03:23.660
They actually put them up on their site. I think it's like P-Nintendo.com or something, and it stands for something in French.

03:03:23.660 --> 03:03:24.660
I don't know. I don't speak French.

03:03:24.660 --> 03:03:29.160
But they actually put the pictures I sent up, the Nintendo-specific ones.

03:03:29.160 --> 03:03:32.160
So we've actually been getting a lot of hits today because of that.

03:03:32.160 --> 03:03:36.160
So hello to any of our new listeners who might be French, coming from the French Nintendo site.

03:03:36.160 --> 03:03:39.160
And I don't speak it, so I'm not going to even try to pronounce the name of the site.

03:03:39.160 --> 03:03:41.160
But we appreciate the shout-out nonetheless.

03:03:41.160 --> 03:03:44.660
The last French I learned was back in sixth grade, and I can't remember.

03:03:44.660 --> 03:03:49.020
The only thing I know how to say is, uh, what are you doing this weekend, and I'm sure that's

03:03:49.020 --> 03:03:52.340
useful in some instance, but, uh...

03:03:52.340 --> 03:03:53.340
Alright.

03:03:53.340 --> 03:03:54.340
Um...

03:03:54.340 --> 03:03:55.340
That's it.

03:03:55.340 --> 03:03:56.340
We gotta wrap up the show, you guys.

03:03:56.340 --> 03:03:59.340
Uh, some folks in the chatroom are asking about the sex game, they wanna hear your story

03:03:59.340 --> 03:04:00.340
with the sex game.

03:04:00.340 --> 03:04:03.620
I'm gonna have to tell you guys, go to the podcast, cause it's all in the podcast, uh,

03:04:03.620 --> 03:04:05.140
Thursday and Friday's edition.

03:04:05.140 --> 03:04:06.140
You can talk about it.

03:04:06.140 --> 03:04:08.620
Uh, their website, unfortunately, does not have anything about the game, or at least

03:04:08.620 --> 03:04:12.740
it's all in Korean and I couldn't figure it out, so, no.

03:04:12.740 --> 03:04:16.040
I will purchase the game because I actually told Nellie about it and she wanted to play

03:04:16.040 --> 03:04:17.200
it.

03:04:17.200 --> 03:04:18.880
Even after I told her about the Purrfuls.

03:04:18.880 --> 03:04:21.640
So I don't know if that's going to be interesting.

03:04:21.640 --> 03:04:25.440
Alright, we are out of here you guys.

03:04:25.440 --> 03:04:27.680
Final thought, Loki.

03:04:27.680 --> 03:04:30.440
I drank too much water.

03:04:30.440 --> 03:04:36.160
And my final thought is, I'm hungry and I feel like a, I feel like one of those McDonald's

03:04:36.160 --> 03:04:38.960
fruit and walnut salads for some weird ass reason.

03:04:38.960 --> 03:04:40.720
Ice cream would be really good too though.

03:04:40.720 --> 03:04:42.040
I gotta eat yogurt.

03:04:42.040 --> 03:04:44.680
I got this thing of yogurt and it's getting old.

03:04:44.680 --> 03:04:46.960
Final word of the show.

03:04:46.960 --> 03:04:47.760
Good night, everybody.

03:04:47.760 --> 03:04:48.520
Have a good one.

03:04:48.520 --> 03:04:50.920
And we'll see you next week with More Orange Lounge.

03:04:50.920 --> 03:04:51.800
Dark Sakura will be back.

03:04:51.800 --> 03:04:53.800
We hope to have guests in the studio as well.

03:04:53.800 --> 03:04:56.880
Don't forget to check out our podcast and other live shows.

03:04:56.880 --> 03:04:59.400
There will be a surprise live show this week as well.

03:04:59.400 --> 03:05:01.400
That's all I'm going to say.

03:05:01.400 --> 03:05:01.880
Tune in.

03:05:01.880 --> 03:05:03.440
Maybe our live journal community will have more

03:05:03.440 --> 03:05:04.200
information on that.

03:05:04.200 --> 03:05:04.880
We'll see.

03:05:04.880 --> 03:05:06.600
And tonight's Fortune Cookie.

03:05:06.600 --> 03:05:09.040
Dark Sakura didn't send me a new one just yet, so you get a

03:05:09.040 --> 03:05:11.880
classic Fortune Cookie from our archives that I love.

03:05:11.880 --> 03:05:13.560
Final word of the show, Loki.

03:05:13.560 --> 03:05:15.200
One word that sums it all up.

03:05:15.200 --> 03:05:17.240
Beatmania.

03:05:17.240 --> 03:05:19.880
That does it for another episode of

03:05:19.880 --> 03:05:22.800
Orange Lounge Radio Live.

03:05:22.800 --> 03:05:25.600
Orange Lounge Radio Live is an Orange

03:05:25.600 --> 03:05:27.800

Exactly. The number three, which is how many joints I've smoked today.
