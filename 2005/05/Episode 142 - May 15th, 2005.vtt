WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.320
Think you're getting used to what you've got

00:05.320 --> 00:10.320
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

00:35.320 --> 00:42.320
The following live program is a special presentation of our program.

01:05.320 --> 01:07.320
Orange Lounge Radio

01:19.320 --> 01:23.640
Well, you know typically this week would be the calm before the storm

01:23.640 --> 01:28.280
very quiet week before E3 when all the you know companies would announce their

01:28.280 --> 01:29.080
new stuff

01:29.080 --> 01:33.040
but boy we didn't luck out that way this week I thought I'd be able to nap through

01:33.040 --> 01:34.360
tonight's show but

01:34.360 --> 01:37.640
Did things just explode this week or what?

01:37.640 --> 01:44.640
Just mass hysteria throughout the Bahmani community this week. If you've been living

01:46.200 --> 01:49.560
under a rock somewhere, I guess we'll have to explain it to you.

01:49.560 --> 01:53.080
And it's not just one thing. I realize one thing has been dominating the news

01:53.080 --> 01:54.760
this week, but there's more to it than that.

01:54.760 --> 01:58.920
And I think that's gonna be the running theme tonight. There's more to it than it seems.

01:58.920 --> 02:01.680
I think the other thing is, I told you

02:01.680 --> 02:07.240
So there's two themes tonight.

02:07.240 --> 02:12.040
Look closer than it seems and Jamie told you so.

02:12.040 --> 02:13.040
Exactly.

02:13.040 --> 02:17.040
Orange Lounge Episode 142, right after this.

02:17.040 --> 02:24.040
Orange Lounge Radio is presented in the TMI sound format.

02:47.040 --> 03:15.040
You're mentioning the Orange Line Radium Line, the Montauk Radium Line, so much more.

03:15.040 --> 03:17.040
Oh

03:19.520 --> 03:21.520
God

03:21.840 --> 03:23.840
Call me daddy

03:24.720 --> 03:28.080
Orange lounge they contain adult content

03:28.800 --> 03:32.560
Orange lounge may contain many four-letter words

03:33.360 --> 03:36.360
Orange lounge may contain a scene of nudity

03:37.160 --> 03:39.720
Orange lounge may contain plenty of

03:39.720 --> 03:46.720
Just kidding, Orange Lounge Radio will not contain any of that.

03:46.960 --> 03:47.960
In this episode...

03:47.960 --> 03:54.400
Well, isn't that special?

You're tuned into Orange Lounge Radio, radio that gamers really want, and this is Orange

04:31.120 --> 04:36.400

as Sky. Joining me, as always, are my awesome co-hosts. In this corner, the happiest bunny

04:51.600 --> 04:54.680
on the farm is Jamie Summers, better known as Dark Sakura.

04:54.680 --> 04:56.680
Hi, everyone!

04:56.680 --> 04:59.680
You're very perky tonight.

04:59.680 --> 05:01.680
I'm such a faker.

05:01.680 --> 05:03.680
As opposed to the fucking bitch you were last week.

05:03.680 --> 05:05.680
Just kidding.

05:05.680 --> 05:08.680
I just wanted that reaction.

05:08.680 --> 05:12.680
Aw, I love you.

05:12.680 --> 05:15.680
Aw, I love you. You know I love you.

05:15.680 --> 05:17.680
I love you.

05:17.680 --> 05:18.680
I love you.

05:18.680 --> 05:21.680
What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What?

05:21.680 --> 05:27.680
Look, it's a three-hour show, lady. We've got a lot to talk about tonight.

05:27.680 --> 05:33.680
All right. Tech Mask the Loki, on vacation tonight, actually. From what I understand,

05:33.680 --> 05:40.680
the woman is making him put out tonight so that he can attend E3 next week. Or something

05:40.840 --> 05:46.680
like that. I think it's actually not as crude as I put it, but, you know.

05:46.680 --> 05:49.680
I think they should be thanking us for taking them off their hands for a while.

05:51.680 --> 05:52.680
Just kidding.

05:52.680 --> 05:55.680
The politically correct version of that story doesn't equal as good ratings.

05:55.680 --> 06:01.680
So what's very interesting about tonight's show is that it's just Dark Sakura Night.

06:01.680 --> 06:02.680
There are no special guests here.

06:02.680 --> 06:03.680
Flashback.

06:03.680 --> 06:07.680
As of yet, do we still have the folks coming that you were mentioning earlier?

06:07.680 --> 06:09.680
I don't know. I don't have a confirmation.

06:09.680 --> 06:10.680
Okay, we don't know.

06:10.680 --> 06:12.680
I didn't want to go eat at the buffet at the casino.

06:12.680 --> 06:14.680
Oh, that's a good place though. Anyway.

06:14.680 --> 06:33.680
So it's just going to be Dark Sakura Night tonight, feeling the love, which is kind of works out because I know everybody and their mom wants to get on the skype line tonight, um, because of some, some news story that was going on, something about, something about like a jaw suit or a raw suit, I don't know, something like that.

06:33.680 --> 06:39.680
Raw suit! Raw suit though!

06:39.680 --> 06:45.320

07:11.100 --> 07:16.980
to have Bamani coexisting with some, like one or two In The Groove songs. The way some

07:16.980 --> 07:21.640
people would like to see it. But we'll see. Can't we all just get along? Can't we all

07:21.640 --> 07:26.960

Orange Lounge Radio is proud to present a celebrity interview.

14:35.920 --> 14:39.680
Can you introduce yourself for our listeners? I'm Miss Cleo.

14:39.680 --> 14:43.320
Oh, it's great to have you on the show today. Hello, how are you today?

14:43.320 --> 14:46.600
I'm great, thanks. Did you have a question? Well,

14:46.600 --> 14:50.180
yes, actually I wanted to know... Can I please have your first name

14:50.180 --> 14:53.520

14:53.520 --> 14:58.020
Well, no. I actually just wanted to know what you thought of Orange Lounge Radio.

14:58.020 --> 14:59.020
Alright, go ahead.

14:59.020 --> 15:02.520
Well, what do you think of Loki, one of the three hosts of Orange Lounge Radio?

15:02.520 --> 15:04.020
Is he incarcerated?

15:04.020 --> 15:08.020
Uh, actually, no he's not. But what do you think of the ever-ranty Dark Sakura?

15:08.020 --> 15:09.520
Hi, dear. How are you?

15:09.520 --> 15:11.020
I love you.

15:11.020 --> 15:14.020
I see you two must know each other. Well, what do you think of Skye?

15:14.020 --> 15:16.020
Did he used to play football when he was in high school?

15:16.020 --> 15:18.020
Well, actually, no he didn't.

15:19.020 --> 15:21.020
Well, what do you think of Intern Zero?

15:21.020 --> 15:23.020
I want you to really remember

15:23.020 --> 15:28.420

15:43.940 --> 15:52.900

15:52.900 --> 15:54.900
Cleo, I love you!

16:22.900 --> 16:24.900
I remember when, like, third Korean was the shit.

16:24.900 --> 16:28.900
Thank you.

16:28.900 --> 16:35.900
Um, so the only thing that's keeping us sane tonight is just acting a little crazy, so you'll have to excuse me.

16:35.900 --> 16:37.900
I don't know about you.

16:37.900 --> 16:39.900
Listen, barnyard.

16:39.900 --> 16:45.900
I don't know if it's just me, but I've been kind of like in a weird funk all week.

16:45.900 --> 16:49.900
Why don't I just talk to myself tonight?

16:49.900 --> 16:51.900
Sorry.

16:51.900 --> 16:55.660
No, I don't blame you.

16:55.660 --> 16:56.300
Like, I don't know.

16:56.300 --> 16:57.900
Tonight is supposed to be the show.

16:57.900 --> 17:01.500
Like, you know, we're packing during the show.

17:01.500 --> 17:05.020
The Survivor finale's on, and I'm having to miss it.

17:05.020 --> 17:06.660
You reality TV whore.

17:06.660 --> 17:07.180
I know.

17:07.180 --> 17:09.540
And just don't freaking spoil it for me in the chat room.

17:09.540 --> 17:12.060
I swear to God, that'll be like an instant ban for life

17:12.060 --> 17:13.060
if you spoil it for me.

17:13.060 --> 17:14.940
Everybody die!

17:14.940 --> 17:15.900
Yeah, everybody die.

17:15.900 --> 17:16.780
Hurricane!

17:16.780 --> 17:18.820
That's how it ends.

17:18.820 --> 17:19.820
You have to televise it too.

17:19.820 --> 17:21.820
And then Loki's not even here.

17:21.820 --> 17:22.820
So it's kind of weird.

17:22.820 --> 17:24.820
I have enough anger for this show.

17:24.820 --> 17:25.820
I know you do.

17:25.820 --> 17:28.820
And there's no reason you and I can't do a show just by ourselves, you know, feeling

17:28.820 --> 17:29.820
the love.

17:29.820 --> 17:30.820
Plutonic love.

17:30.820 --> 17:31.820
But...

17:31.820 --> 17:32.820
Patitos!

17:32.820 --> 17:37.820
It's like, couldn't I run a rerun tonight?

17:37.820 --> 17:38.820
Do we really have to do a show?

17:38.820 --> 17:42.820
I know, doesn't that make people excited about the show to hear me talk about how I'd rather

17:42.820 --> 17:43.820
be somewhere else?

17:43.820 --> 17:45.820
Dear chat room, we want ice cream.

17:45.820 --> 17:47.820
But there's just too much other crap going on.

17:47.820 --> 17:55.260
crap going on. We have to acknowledge it. It was supposed to be that everything is quiet

17:55.260 --> 18:00.900
the week before E3 and now just the shit hit the fan. Seriously. In so many ways.

18:00.900 --> 18:09.900
The shit hitting the fan had excellent timing. Anyway, let's talk about How Was Your Week?

18:09.900 --> 18:13.160
How Was Your Day? We always do start off the show this way. I was a little worried about

18:13.160 --> 18:15.840
doing How Was Your Week? How Was Your Day? because usually we have a studio full of like

18:15.840 --> 18:19.480
10 people and we would have never gotten to the lawsuit stuff but this is just you

18:19.480 --> 18:22.920
and I suppose we have the time so how was your week how was your day now first

18:22.920 --> 18:29.840
of all to be grammatically correct that would be you and me whatever ha

18:29.840 --> 18:35.400
actually that is one of my grammatical pet peeves but everybody does it somewhere

18:35.400 --> 18:41.920
okay my week has been homework homework homework homework and homework I've been

18:41.920 --> 18:53.040
doing two weeks of homework in one week I finished what the fuck did I do I did

18:53.040 --> 19:01.920
my color harmony painting I finished that turned it in gotta be thank you I

19:01.920 --> 19:08.720
burped off camera what the hell are you talking about I cut out a bunch of

19:08.720 --> 19:14.320
pictures for my montage, I still have a few more to do, which is my final on Monday.

19:14.320 --> 19:17.840
I got to do fan art as my digital illustration.

19:17.840 --> 19:19.840
How cool is that?

19:19.840 --> 19:24.340
I was up until 5 a.m. writing a tutorial on how to make live journal icons in PaintShop

19:24.340 --> 19:25.340
Pro.

19:25.340 --> 19:30.920
My tutorial looks pretty damn good by the way.

19:30.920 --> 19:35.320
Had adventures at Target at closing time.

19:35.320 --> 19:42.320
I went to Rapture on Thursday, which was very fun.

19:42.320 --> 19:43.960
Rapture.

19:43.960 --> 19:48.840
Not in the blondie sense, this is in the hi, let's all wear black and listen to industrial

19:48.840 --> 19:50.640
music and get very drunk.

19:50.640 --> 19:54.560
It was really fun, I had a good time.

19:54.560 --> 19:59.600
I drank whiskey for the first time in like a year, it was good.

19:59.600 --> 20:08.840
Guinness Guinness and whiskey makes me happy girl um it's just been getting

20:08.840 --> 20:14.320
ready for e3 really getting stuff together getting crap off my laptop

20:14.320 --> 20:19.640
which fries today by the data cable fries is fun fries is like going to the

20:19.640 --> 20:26.000
zoo because you can look at electronics in their natural habitat see the mating

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
call of the USB cable.

20:28.000 --> 20:29.000
Data!

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
Data!

20:30.000 --> 20:35.440
MP3 players are damn expensive, by the way.

20:35.440 --> 20:37.000
Damn expensive.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
Even for the little dinky ones.

20:39.000 --> 20:40.000
Stupid.

20:40.000 --> 20:48.160
I bought Pulp Fiction on DVD today, which was $14 for the special edition, but I already

20:48.160 --> 20:52.440
had it on LaserDisc, the four disc set.

20:52.440 --> 20:57.360
Yes, I have and watch laserdiscs, and our laserdisc player still works.

20:57.360 --> 21:05.400
Oh yeah, and I went to, not Fry's, but to Dimple Records, it's one of the local resale

21:05.400 --> 21:11.340
places, you know, used records and stuff, and yeah, records are those big discs that

21:11.340 --> 21:14.680
are hiding in your parents' garage.

21:14.680 --> 21:19.280
But I found the Captain Jack CD, and that's pretty cool, it's like the old one.

21:19.280 --> 21:22.080
Yeah, this is the Captain Jack CD, uh, The Mission.

21:22.080 --> 21:23.780
I'll try to put this up on cam a little later.

21:23.780 --> 21:28.980
Um, but we're gonna play a couple tr- uh, at least one, maybe two tracks from the CD a little later on.

21:28.980 --> 21:30.780
So, this should be fun.

21:30.780 --> 21:34.280
And remember, kids, don't copy that floppy.

21:34.280 --> 21:36.080
Or what did- what did he always say?

21:36.080 --> 21:37.780
Don't copy music?

21:37.780 --> 21:39.080
Don't remember, I-

21:39.080 --> 21:41.780
Man, I can't even remember our own show's inside jokes.

21:41.780 --> 21:44.480
Do not copy the CD!

21:44.480 --> 21:47.080
You go to hell if you do!

21:47.080 --> 21:52.080
And the reference I'm making, of course, is to an old Captain Jack CD. I'm going to have to find this now.

21:52.080 --> 21:56.080
Which, of course, is funny since you have it copied.

21:56.080 --> 21:57.080
Yeah, exactly.

21:57.080 --> 21:59.080
That is irony.

21:59.080 --> 22:06.080
I also spent the week downloading a bunch of Radiohead and the Bees and Super Furry Animals,

22:06.080 --> 22:10.080
which everybody got to hear at the beginning of my show on Tuesday.

22:10.080 --> 22:16.080
By the way, of course, no show on Tuesday because I will be in a car.

22:16.080 --> 22:18.080
Sorry, can't do that.

22:18.080 --> 22:19.080
Um...

22:19.080 --> 22:20.080
Can I interrupt for one sec?

22:20.080 --> 22:21.080
No.

22:21.080 --> 22:22.080
Please?

22:22.080 --> 22:23.080
Okay.

22:23.080 --> 22:25.080
Really, Japanese tourists.

22:25.080 --> 22:33.080
Hey folks, this was CJ Radio presenting you Captain Jack's Greatest Summer Heads.

22:33.080 --> 22:40.080
Keep the spirit, the sun is shining wherever you are, and don't forget, coffee kills music.

22:40.080 --> 22:43.080
So, don't coffee, buy our records.

22:43.080 --> 22:46.080
Five, five, party never ends.

22:46.080 --> 22:49.080
Copy kills music. Thank you, Captain Jack.

22:49.080 --> 22:51.080
Ow. Ow. Music dead.

22:51.080 --> 22:54.080
Copied.

22:54.080 --> 22:58.080
Ironically, that was copied from the original album.

22:58.080 --> 23:02.080
I can't think of anything else, so I'm just not going to say anything.

23:02.080 --> 23:06.080
I'm going to caress the ferret.

23:06.080 --> 23:10.080
By the way, you need to figure out which ferret is being sacrificed

23:10.080 --> 23:16.440
to the giant katamari at E3 because one of them will be stuck on the katamari at E3.

23:16.440 --> 23:18.700
Get over it.

23:18.700 --> 23:19.700
For those of you guys that haven't heard...

23:19.700 --> 23:20.700
Retard!

23:20.700 --> 23:23.700
Yeah, we'll find the retarded ferret, and that's the one we're going to katamari.

23:23.700 --> 23:30.220
For those of you guys that haven't heard, E3 is going to have a giant katamari ball

23:30.220 --> 23:34.120
where people can put whatever they want onto it, well, within reason.

23:34.120 --> 23:35.700
You can't put, like, you know, X-rated things.

23:35.700 --> 23:39.640
I think they said no clothing, so I can't put a pair of dirty underwear on there or

23:39.640 --> 23:44.160
things like that so we've decided that we will be sticking the ferret a ferret

23:44.160 --> 23:47.560
onto the katamari at e3 and we'll take a picture and of course post on we should

23:47.560 --> 23:51.280
put the business cards on there too and I'm putting reject false icon stickers

23:51.280 --> 23:55.320
on there and we might put one of our about media handouts on there as well we

23:55.320 --> 23:59.800
have this is we're set for e3 this year we dark Sakura has twice the business

23:59.800 --> 24:02.720
card she had last year because she was the only one of us to give away all her

24:02.720 --> 24:06.920
business cards by the end of the second day and I gave away some yeah and she

24:06.920 --> 24:09.960
She started giving away mine, and I only have like five left.

24:09.960 --> 24:13.020
So Jamie now has twice as many cards at least this year.

24:13.020 --> 24:14.520
And you know I whore us out.

24:14.520 --> 24:15.520
Oh yeah.

24:15.520 --> 24:17.160
So I'm excited about that.

24:17.160 --> 24:19.780
Anyway, sorry.

24:19.780 --> 24:20.780
My week and my day.

24:20.780 --> 24:24.120
I played a lot of PSO Blue Burst, because that's in beta right now.

24:24.120 --> 24:25.120
I played that too.

24:25.120 --> 24:26.120
And that makes it, yeah, we all played.

24:26.120 --> 24:27.120
At level 6.

24:27.120 --> 24:30.500
Me, you, Miklotov, and one of your friends from the Gorillaz boards, right?

24:30.500 --> 24:31.500
We were all playing.

24:31.500 --> 24:32.500
Yeah.

24:32.500 --> 24:36.160
Well, my character is like super gothy for a while.

24:36.160 --> 24:39.440
Ooh, sorry, I just, I really like this thought from the chat room.

24:39.440 --> 24:43.240
MPQ is asking, put UltraCade on the Katamari.

24:43.240 --> 24:47.760
That's a good idea, but we don't want to stink up the Katamari with stinky UltraCade.

24:47.760 --> 24:50.320
We should print out some pictures of us kicking UltraCades.

24:50.320 --> 24:55.000
And then Illusion says, uh, you should put a Katamari on the Katamari.

24:55.000 --> 24:56.200
You know what I wanted to do?

24:56.200 --> 24:57.200
What?

24:57.200 --> 25:01.560
If I have one of those little PDF files of the print cutouts, if we can, if I can take

25:01.560 --> 25:05.080
my X-Acto knife to it, if someone can put it together, we can actually stick the prints

25:05.080 --> 25:06.080
on there.

25:06.080 --> 25:08.080
We should install Linux on the Katamari.

25:08.080 --> 25:11.080
Yeah! We should put like a big Linux penguin on it.

25:11.080 --> 25:14.080
Or as Tetris said, put NetBSD.

25:14.080 --> 25:18.080
But I think Linux is really the one that, you know, yeah.

25:18.080 --> 25:20.080
We should put the Linux penguin on it.

25:20.080 --> 25:21.080
Maybe.

25:21.080 --> 25:24.080
Hey, chat room. Okay, chat room.

25:24.080 --> 25:29.080
Go ahead and PM me with suggestions for what should go on the Katamari.

25:29.080 --> 25:33.080
And we'll think.

25:33.080 --> 25:36.360
e3 email address specifically set up for your guys's questions because we are

25:36.360 --> 25:39.760
going to be podcasting every day from e3 I don't think we're doing anything on

25:39.760 --> 25:42.520
Tuesday the night before but we're gonna do something Wednesday Thursday Friday

25:42.520 --> 25:46.800
night so make sure you're subscribed and checking the iPod or feed we've made

25:46.800 --> 25:50.560
podcast more than that if we have time it just kind of depends what's gonna

25:50.560 --> 25:54.480
happen but we are going to be giving you updates from e3 here's the thing

25:54.480 --> 25:58.480
unfortunately I know a lot of you guys can't be there for whatever reason we

25:58.480 --> 26:02.460
have an email address set up so you can send us questions if you want us to be

26:02.460 --> 26:07.460
the investigative reporters and go investigate a game for you and find out some details and

26:07.460 --> 26:11.180
bring back or you just have a question about E3 in general or you want a picture with something,

26:11.180 --> 26:12.180
I don't know.

26:12.180 --> 26:15.940
You're going to send us an email and then we will do that and give you the answer on

26:15.940 --> 26:16.940
the podcast.

26:16.940 --> 26:19.940
Calamari on the Calamari.

26:19.940 --> 26:22.220
Anyway.

26:22.220 --> 26:25.380
We should do a list list tonight even though it's just us.

26:25.380 --> 26:26.380
Just us?

26:26.380 --> 26:27.380
We could have my roommate participate.

26:27.380 --> 26:30.340
Do you want to participate in a list list tonight?

26:30.340 --> 26:33.340
My roommate has no idea what he's in for.

26:33.340 --> 26:34.340
Yes.

26:34.340 --> 26:35.340
Okay.

26:35.340 --> 26:36.340
Cool.

26:36.340 --> 26:37.340
Well, then we'll have to think of something.

26:37.340 --> 26:38.340
But you have to remember...

26:38.340 --> 26:39.340
We need to do things to put on the Katamari.

26:39.340 --> 26:40.340
Chris?

26:40.340 --> 26:43.340
Well, see, but Chris, do you even know what Katamari Damacy is, Chris?

26:43.340 --> 26:44.340
Um, yes.

26:44.340 --> 26:45.340
Oh, he does know.

26:45.340 --> 26:46.340
Okay, he does know.

26:46.340 --> 26:47.340
I do know.

26:47.340 --> 26:49.340
Okay, so then maybe we can do that as a list list later tonight.

26:49.340 --> 26:50.340
Oh, that's a good idea.

26:50.340 --> 26:51.340
We'll get somebody on Skype, too.

26:51.340 --> 26:52.340
In fact, I already have somebody in mind.

26:52.340 --> 26:53.340
We'll get a special guest on Skype.

26:53.340 --> 26:54.340
Okay.

26:54.340 --> 26:55.340
So we will...

26:55.340 --> 26:56.340
We can do this.

26:56.340 --> 26:57.340
We can totally do this.

26:57.340 --> 27:02.380
angry person yeah with his spiky hair and trench coat who's probably getting

27:02.380 --> 27:08.900
laid right now okay cricket anyway like it's true what else did I do this week I

27:08.900 --> 27:12.860
am I was lethargic all week on oh my car got broken in two that was my the

27:12.860 --> 27:17.580
highlight of my way that you deserve to be a bit out of it this week yeah my car

27:17.580 --> 27:21.540
got broken into Wednesday night I think it was Wednesday night my car got broken

27:21.540 --> 27:26.380
in two and they took my stereo but here's the ironic thing I've actually

27:26.380 --> 27:30.660
been using an iPod with the auxiliary cable on my stereo because the CD

27:30.660 --> 27:36.360
player's broken hahaha you stole a broken stereo you stupid asshole but you

27:36.360 --> 27:39.580
also took my class ring which was in a front compartment in the car and then a

27:39.580 --> 27:43.220
Commodore 64 monitor which I don't know why it was in the backseat it just was

27:43.220 --> 27:49.780
okay just shut up so yeah my car broke out got broken into that sucks you know

27:49.780 --> 27:53.260
what else sucks is calling the police department to file the report and then

27:53.260 --> 27:56.660
you ask them have you heard of any others any other break-ins in the area

27:56.660 --> 28:02.500
last night and they go well you know we're really understaffed right now and

28:02.500 --> 28:04.900
I haven't gotten to the messages from last night yet because we're all

28:04.900 --> 28:09.500
volunteers here and I'm the only one here and I'm just like I feel safe here

28:09.500 --> 28:16.260
and lovely. Especially for a complex of this size. No it was the city it was the city's

28:16.260 --> 28:20.660
Police Department. The city is staffed by volunteers.

28:20.660 --> 28:26.140
That's retarded. I'm gonna cry.

28:26.140 --> 28:30.700
So, by the way, if Orange Launch Radio, if we get shot or something and we die,

28:30.700 --> 28:34.620
you'll know why. Because the police is staffed by volunteers. Send all angry

28:34.620 --> 28:36.860
letters to Sacramento City PD,

28:36.860 --> 28:40.140
blah blah blah, blah blah blah. Anyway,

28:40.140 --> 28:44.780
that's my week and my day, pretty much. How was your week and your day?

28:44.780 --> 28:51.560
Okay, great. Let's talk about the big news this week. Huge news, let's just get into

28:51.560 --> 28:53.980
it. I know a lot of you guys are tuning in tonight because you want to hear our thoughts

28:53.980 --> 28:59.880
on it. In case you've been living under a rock or something, I'm going to play for you

28:59.880 --> 29:04.560
guys our first news break. We actually did a news break earlier this week because we

29:04.560 --> 29:14.760
actually had some new news. So, if I can find it. I'm well prepared for this right now.

29:14.760 --> 29:23.920
just a minute guys we apologize for this technical break I don't the Rob does

29:23.920 --> 29:28.760
damn it I'm all embarrassed and stuff I thought I had that final ready to go

29:28.760 --> 29:32.400
there it is all right here we go fair it laughs at you here was the news break

29:32.400 --> 29:34.760
our very first orange on radio news break from earlier this week that tells

29:34.760 --> 29:42.240
the story of what's been going on orange lounge radio news break guy here with an

29:42.240 --> 29:46.560
Orange Lounge Radio news update for this May 11, 2005.

29:46.560 --> 29:51.360
Orange Lounge Radio has learned that Konami of Japan has filed an injunction against Roxor

29:51.360 --> 29:56.400
Games, claiming trademark and patent infringement against Dance Dance Revolution with Roxor's

29:56.400 --> 29:57.760
own game, In the Groove.

29:57.760 --> 30:03.080
In a press release posted on Konami of Japan's website, Konami claims, quote, the present

30:03.080 --> 30:09.060
lawsuit complains that Roxor's game's refitting of DDR arcade games has been done in an infringing

30:09.060 --> 30:10.680
and unfair way.

30:10.680 --> 30:15.260
will continue to take any legal measures necessary to protect Konami's intellectual property

30:15.260 --> 30:19.220
rights in DDR and other Konami products."

30:19.220 --> 30:22.820
For more information on this story as it develops, visit www.

30:22.820 --> 30:25.900
Yada yada yada yada, plug for the website, you're obviously already there.

30:25.900 --> 30:31.500
So that was the first bit of news that came out as the Konami of Japan put that press

30:31.500 --> 30:36.460
release on their site that says, you know, we've finally discovered that there's this

30:36.460 --> 30:43.020
game in the U.S. that might be kind of infringing on some of our rights here.

30:43.020 --> 30:47.140
At that point I fell out of my chair. Laughing or what?

30:47.140 --> 30:52.500
Laughing my ass off. Okay. But I want to get your clear thoughts later

30:52.500 --> 30:56.020
because you're not really an in the groove hater because you were just here last week

30:56.020 --> 30:57.460
saying it's not that bad. Yeah.

30:57.460 --> 31:04.240
Right? But I was still laughing my ass off. Yeah. And then a little later in the day actually

31:04.240 --> 31:09.680
what happened over on DDR Freak is that, um, Cutrus, one of the admins over there, actually

31:09.680 --> 31:18.020
dug up, like, all smoking gun style, managed to dig up the actual copy, actual copy, like

31:18.020 --> 31:22.300
you would see on thesmokinggun.com when, like, celebrities get busted and stuff, dug up the

31:22.300 --> 31:27.200
actual copy of the injunction. That's cool. Now, I could sit here and read the whole damn

31:27.200 --> 31:31.280
thing, but it's boring as hell. Well, I read it over on DDR Freak. And what'd you think?

31:31.280 --> 31:36.720
You know, well being that I did just get out of a business law class last semester, a lot

31:36.720 --> 31:40.320
of it, you know, see this is everything that I had pointed out.

31:40.320 --> 31:44.280
They are using freaking DDR cabinets which are a patent of Konami.

31:44.280 --> 31:49.000
You know, they had no legal precedent to use it.

31:49.000 --> 31:54.840
The thing is that I think where Konami is getting, you know, the big issue from this

31:54.840 --> 32:00.560
is that, you know, with all those other little two bit ones, you know, they're not going

32:00.560 --> 32:03.440
make a whole bunch of money on it they're not trying to mass market it I

32:03.440 --> 32:06.520
think it's at the point that in the groove is trying to go to the home

32:06.520 --> 32:10.560
market you think you're hitting on a big thing here because I know a lot of what

32:10.560 --> 32:13.720
I've been reading and this this news just exploded on the internet I mean God

32:13.720 --> 32:18.960
the DDR freak thread hit like 300 posts in a day it was insane this is the

32:18.960 --> 32:23.680
they're lit up the boards are lit up and people are going go Konami go and then

32:23.680 --> 32:27.800
people are saying you know fuck Konami for you know killing in the groove and

32:27.800 --> 32:31.600
people say boycott Konami and people saying boycott the boycotters and just

32:31.600 --> 32:37.720
very polarizing. I boycott you. Yeah. So I decided to boycott the threat. No, actually I

32:37.720 --> 32:42.360
didn't. It's like it's like my soap opera. I've been checking it every day.

32:42.360 --> 32:47.000
Every day. Religiously. Like every hour on the hour for updates. Next on As the

32:47.000 --> 32:50.920
Arrow Flies. I mean as Jamie said earlier in the show I'm a reality news or reality

32:50.920 --> 32:55.080
TV whore. This is as good as it gets. Which company is gonna get voted off the

32:55.080 --> 33:00.320
planet? Well, the thing that I really, you know, liked is that when they were speaking

33:00.320 --> 33:05.640
of the cabinet, they pulled up the full schematics of the damn cabinet and outlined each point

33:05.640 --> 33:10.680
and how each point is particular specifically to a DDR machine, which is why I think that

33:10.680 --> 33:15.000
there wasn't an issue with the Pump It Up machines, because they were different enough

33:15.000 --> 33:18.820
to bypass. Here's the interesting thing. You've brought up a couple points I really want to

33:18.820 --> 33:22.560
emphasize because I feel very similar. A lot of people, when this news first came out,

33:22.560 --> 33:28.320
said, S-T-F-U, before the documents came out, people were saying shut the F up, this has

33:28.320 --> 33:33.240
nothing to do with the home version, the home version release will not be affected by this,

33:33.240 --> 33:37.680
this is strictly about the arcade, and this is only going to affect In the Groove arcade

33:37.680 --> 33:42.960
cabinets and it will have nothing to do with In the Groove 2 because this is all about

33:42.960 --> 33:48.800
In the Groove 1. I say wrong. I say this has everything to do with the home version.

33:48.800 --> 33:53.200
Because they're putting this out right before they're getting the releases done.

33:53.200 --> 33:55.480
The timing is crazy.

33:55.480 --> 34:00.200
I mean, really, at first the timing of this almost makes it look like Konami has Rockstar

34:00.200 --> 34:03.720
by the Balls right now, basically, with the in-the-groove home release coming out.

34:03.720 --> 34:06.740
Poor Red Octane, really, who kind of is caught in the middle of this now.

34:06.740 --> 34:10.740
Nowhere named in the lawsuit, but you know, all this money invested in the last bus premiere

34:10.740 --> 34:11.740
party.

34:11.740 --> 34:12.740
Oh yeah.

34:12.740 --> 34:16.920
So, they've got Rockstar by the Balls right now just before E3 when this is supposed to

34:16.920 --> 34:17.920
be unveiled.

34:17.920 --> 34:21.040
obviously probably what they're trying to do is get this to settle out of court

34:21.040 --> 34:24.240
which I could say with probably ninety-eight percent certainty will

34:24.240 --> 34:25.160
probably happen

34:25.160 --> 34:30.360
I can't honestly see this going to court. I'm wondering though with such a small company

34:30.360 --> 34:34.440
you know, Rockstar's basically just getting off the ground, where are they going to get the

34:34.440 --> 34:35.520
kind of money to

34:35.520 --> 34:40.000
they have that other game, uh, Tux Racer or something but I mean who'd have heard of

34:40.000 --> 34:41.760
that before this, you know

34:41.760 --> 34:45.520
like I said, just getting off the ground

34:45.520 --> 34:54.000
The other thing, you know, is that they could be sitting on perhaps, you know, and this

34:54.000 --> 34:55.000
is speculation.

34:55.000 --> 35:00.520
I've been trying to think of all kinds of things that might be the background motive.

35:00.520 --> 35:05.480
Because basically Konami of America is pulled out of the arcade market as far as EDR is

35:05.480 --> 35:06.480
concerned.

35:06.480 --> 35:12.280
It doesn't necessarily mean that the powers that be at the main place in Japan might not

35:12.280 --> 35:16.560
I'd be thinking, hey, we can market over there, too.

35:16.560 --> 35:18.360
What do you think about this argument that's coming from a

35:18.360 --> 35:22.120
lot, and I'm kind of trying hard not to take sides here,

35:22.120 --> 35:27.200
because I respect what In the Groove tried to do.

35:27.200 --> 35:32.680
It tried to revive a dying arcade dance scene, and it was

35:32.680 --> 35:36.160
put together by fans.

35:36.160 --> 35:37.880
And so I respect the game for that.

35:37.880 --> 35:40.020
And even though I've said negative things about the game

35:40.020 --> 35:41.500
before, I've also said positive things about the

35:41.500 --> 35:44.660
And I've always said, In the Groove is a great first release.

35:44.660 --> 35:47.840
It's not as bad as the haters say, but it's not as good as the people who lavish praise

35:47.840 --> 35:48.840
upon it say.

35:48.840 --> 35:51.180
There's room for improvement, but they have some great ideas.

35:51.180 --> 35:52.180
Opinions are opinions.

35:52.180 --> 35:53.180
Yeah, exactly.

35:53.180 --> 35:54.360
And I respect what they're doing.

35:54.360 --> 35:56.960
But this honestly doesn't come as any surprise to me.

35:56.960 --> 36:04.820
I think, unfortunately, I can't say so much about the staff, the folks there.

36:04.820 --> 36:08.440
But at least the community has been very arrogant.

36:08.440 --> 36:10.800
Very arrogant ever since the release of In the Groove.

36:10.800 --> 36:13.400
You know, people would ask, is this legal?

36:13.400 --> 36:14.400
And people say, yes it is.

36:14.400 --> 36:15.400
Shut the fuck up.

36:15.400 --> 36:16.400
Lock.

36:16.400 --> 36:19.240
That has put me off much more than the game itself.

36:19.240 --> 36:20.240
Absolutely.

36:20.240 --> 36:22.980
That attitude put me off so bad.

36:22.980 --> 36:26.680
And that's why I can't help but kind of grin a little bit that this is happening.

36:26.680 --> 36:27.680
Oh, yeah.

36:27.680 --> 36:28.680
And I'm sorry.

36:28.680 --> 36:30.660
And I apologize to the folks that have worked so hard on this game.

36:30.660 --> 36:37.500
But that arrogance, that such ass arrogance, to see that get called out to the bike racks

36:37.500 --> 36:39.560
three o'clock after school is satisfying.

36:39.560 --> 36:44.240
I want to be quoted on this on every last single in-the-groove board that those assholes

36:44.240 --> 36:45.240
post on.

36:45.240 --> 36:47.680
I fucking told all of you!

36:47.680 --> 36:50.360
Well, you're not the only one that told me this would happen.

36:50.360 --> 36:51.360
I know.

36:51.360 --> 36:52.360
But I'm...

36:52.360 --> 36:53.360
I have ego, okay?

36:53.360 --> 36:55.560
I told you!

36:55.560 --> 37:00.280
And you can stick your nose up in the air as much as you want to, but it's going to

37:00.280 --> 37:05.080
be shaved off by the low-flying airplane that is Konami.

37:05.080 --> 37:07.480
We can say I told you so on a million things.

37:07.480 --> 37:12.320
Um, what I know I said at least a couple months ago on the show when Red Octane first announced

37:12.320 --> 37:16.080
they were going to publish In the Groove for home, I said, Konami's going to notice.

37:16.080 --> 37:19.960
Isn't that, didn't I say something like that, I said, Konami's, if Konami's going to make

37:19.960 --> 37:21.680
a move, now's the time.

37:21.680 --> 37:25.800
Because In the Groove is now stepping on Konami's turf.

37:25.800 --> 37:31.520
Konami, obviously, even though people say Konami does shit for their fans, they do shit

37:31.520 --> 37:34.720
for DDR, that's a load of crap.

37:34.720 --> 37:39.880
And you consider that there are three DDR games, not one, not two, three.

37:39.880 --> 37:44.000
More games than we've ever seen at E3 are going to be shown next week.

37:44.000 --> 37:45.000
Three games.

37:45.000 --> 37:51.360
I can name a person who has worked his ass off for all of the U.S. fans of DDR.

37:51.360 --> 37:56.360
You know, I honestly have to give big kudos to Jason Enos, because without him, we would

37:56.360 --> 38:02.840
still be paying, you know, 70 bucks to import damn game, and 80 bucks per dance pad.

38:02.840 --> 38:09.160
and instead now we get unique mixes. Japanese players are importing our mixes.

38:09.160 --> 38:10.160
Absolutely. And Ultra Mix.

38:10.160 --> 38:11.160
Now it's the other way around.

38:11.160 --> 38:15.200
And really, it's Festival, it's some, you know, this is debatable, but Festival in some

38:15.200 --> 38:18.080
ways was a copy of Ultra Mix, which was made here.

38:18.080 --> 38:19.080
Yeah.

38:19.080 --> 38:20.080
Yeah.

38:20.080 --> 38:21.080
Anyway.

38:21.080 --> 38:22.360
Because now the market belongs to us.

38:22.360 --> 38:27.720
I say, bullshit, Konami doesn't care about their American audience. Now, okay, granted

38:27.720 --> 38:32.800
you've got the arcade scene, and yes, the arcade scene was hurting, but I guess if you're

38:32.800 --> 38:35.880
Konami you have to make a decision, is this really cost effective for us to be doing,

38:35.880 --> 38:36.880
yada yada yada.

38:36.880 --> 38:40.880
And then people are throwing out all this Andamiro crap and the Andamiro lawsuit is

38:40.880 --> 38:44.060
what kept Konami out of the U.S. for a long time.

38:44.060 --> 38:49.160
The only thing that could even remotely prove this, I have yet to see a legal document that

38:49.160 --> 38:54.140
shows that this settlement would keep Konami out of USDDR forever.

38:54.140 --> 38:57.920
But somebody phrased it this way on a web board or something and it does make sense

38:57.920 --> 39:02.820
is that if Konami and Andamiro settled out of court, neither one has to say what the

39:02.820 --> 39:08.300
terms of that settlement were. Although I'll tell you what, and so maybe, maybe, maybe

39:08.300 --> 39:12.760
that was part of the settlement, but we don't know for sure. And it really, it looks like

39:12.760 --> 39:15.900
Konami got the better end of the deal because if you look at the press release on Konami's

39:15.900 --> 39:20.940
site, now granted it's spun by Konami, it says that Andamiro actually ended up paying

39:20.940 --> 39:25.460
them. So I find it very hard to believe that it's Andamiro keeping Konami out of the U.S.

39:25.460 --> 39:30.220
arcade market. I think it's just the fact that the US arcade market kind of stinks right

39:30.220 --> 39:31.220
now.

39:31.220 --> 39:33.540
Well, I'm glad that they closed down their arcade division.

39:33.540 --> 39:38.180
Yeah, but they still have put out silent scopes and stuff. If they really wanted to do it,

39:38.180 --> 39:43.700
they could, but it would have to be something where, I don't know, the cost has to be justified.

39:43.700 --> 39:48.420
And I've said this on an earlier show, and I still stick by this. I think the reason

39:48.420 --> 39:54.380
why you see Extreme in arcades and Konami kind of turns its back on it, even though

39:54.380 --> 39:57.820
it's not supposed to be in the U.S. I think the reason why you see it in the arcades is

39:57.820 --> 40:03.660
because, hey, licensing music in the U.S. is a whole lot more difficult than it is in

40:03.660 --> 40:10.020
Japan. People, the folks in Japan don't care. You've got all these bands, Captain Jack,

40:10.020 --> 40:14.500
well I don't, for the more recent games with all the folks on Dance Mania, Wild Side, whatever,

40:14.500 --> 40:19.420
that would never have been heard in the U.S. if it wasn't for DDR. So, none of them care.

40:19.420 --> 40:22.780
They had that big, they had that big agreement with Toshiba EMI.

40:22.780 --> 40:27.980
Exactly, you know, and so I think Konami kind of turns its back because it's cheaper to

40:27.980 --> 40:33.260
just let folks bring it over here and then make money off the home releases.

40:33.260 --> 40:38.120
All that is is publicity, and then we're going to be imported anyway, that's how I see it.

40:38.120 --> 40:40.920
That's also a very interesting point you bring up is about the publicity, because people

40:40.920 --> 40:46.760
say, well if Konami doesn't give a shit about the arcade machines anymore, then why is this

40:46.760 --> 40:48.320
such a big deal?

40:48.320 --> 40:55.160
is the big thing. Because if you consider that what In the Groove was in its first release,

40:55.160 --> 41:00.100
what In the Groove was, was a conversion kit that would allow you to change a DDR machine

41:00.100 --> 41:04.660
into an In the Groove machine. Theoretically what they would want to do, you have to admit,

41:04.660 --> 41:10.020
this is a goal of Rock Source in the end, is that they want every DDR machine changed

41:10.020 --> 41:14.920
into an In the Groove machine. Thusly, DDR has no exposure and no presence in the arcades

41:14.920 --> 41:20.240
anymore. Thusly, there's no free advertising for the home releases. And you know what?

41:20.240 --> 41:25.080
Even though DDR Extreme is two years old, people still play it all the time. It is still

41:25.080 --> 41:35.080
huge exposure for Konami. Basically this is, you know, the equivalent of, you know, saying

41:35.080 --> 41:40.280
that you're wearing a t-shirt, you know, that advertises one thing, this is the equivalent

41:40.280 --> 41:45.080
coming up and spray painting the t-shirt. So you can't see the logo.

41:45.080 --> 41:49.680
And a lot of people, this is a weird argument, a lot of people, and this is that arrogance

41:49.680 --> 41:54.120
in the in the group scene again, now please, when I bash on the in the group scene, I've

41:54.120 --> 41:57.800
met some wonderful people from the scene. I'm not talking about everybody. I'm talking

41:57.800 --> 42:03.720
about people that have tunnel vision when it comes to their game, okay? And now I totally

42:03.720 --> 42:09.000
lost my train of thought. Forget it. Damn it. I hate the way I do that.

42:09.000 --> 42:13.000
Yeah, but I was going to say something about In the Groove and the community and when people

42:13.000 --> 42:14.000
say...

42:14.000 --> 42:18.000
In the Groove community, you should all probably gather and give me a dollar each.

42:18.000 --> 42:23.000
Damn, I lost my train of thought.

42:23.000 --> 42:24.000
Derail.

42:24.000 --> 42:25.840
Let's look over some key quotes.

42:25.840 --> 42:30.000
Over on OrangelaungeRadio.com, I actually posted some quotes from the lawsuit.

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
I keep calling it a lawsuit, but it's really not.

42:32.000 --> 42:33.000
It's an injunction.

42:33.000 --> 42:36.000
By the way, we have a poll going on on OrangelaungeRadio.com right now.

42:36.000 --> 42:37.640
We'd really like to hear your opinion.

42:37.640 --> 42:38.640
It's about this whole thing.

42:38.640 --> 42:43.380
check it out. It's in the upper right corner of orangelaundry.com. Quote,

42:43.380 --> 42:47.340
according to instructions provided with defendants, Roxor's in the game

42:47.340 --> 42:50.420
groove kits, the purchaser is instructed to remove the original main circuit

42:50.420 --> 42:54.380
board from the DDR game and replace it with defendants in the groove game

42:54.380 --> 42:57.660
circuit board. So that's one of the big things they're hitting on, of course, is

42:57.660 --> 43:02.780
the fact that, and people were kind of wondering, how's Konami gonna get

43:02.780 --> 43:06.140
Roxor on this? Is, you know, and then it came down to the hardware thing. And I

43:06.140 --> 43:11.300
I think hardware versus software is a huge issue here,

43:11.300 --> 43:14.060
because I know we had the in the groove scene always going,

43:14.060 --> 43:16.260
it's legal, it's legal, it's legal.

43:16.260 --> 43:19.380
Unfortunately, I think they were more concerned

43:19.380 --> 43:21.540
with the software end of it.

43:21.540 --> 43:23.300
And the software part of it probably

43:23.300 --> 43:24.860
is legal, because you'd barely see

43:24.860 --> 43:26.060
it mentioned in the lawsuit.

43:26.060 --> 43:28.780
But the hardware part of it, whoops.

43:28.780 --> 43:29.900
So I don't know.

43:29.900 --> 43:31.980
But maybe they, you know, I'm not Roxor.

43:31.980 --> 43:34.020
Roxor has yet to release a rebuttal for this.

43:34.020 --> 43:35.540
Maybe they did investigate this.

43:35.540 --> 43:40.580
But when I read it, when I read Konami's thing, I go, makes sense.

43:40.580 --> 43:43.600
Makes sense.

43:43.600 --> 43:46.820
Defendant provides materials bearing its own name and or trademarks

43:46.820 --> 43:50.100
to purchasers of the in the groove game to be placed over the plaintiff's marks

43:50.100 --> 43:52.740
and other identifying material on the DDR game.

43:52.740 --> 43:55.220
On information and belief, purchasers fail to cover

43:55.220 --> 43:59.020
plaintiff's marks and or other identifying material in all instances.

43:59.020 --> 44:01.380
The in the groove game, as refitted by purchasers,

44:01.380 --> 44:04.580
therefore displays both plaintiff's marks and defendant's name

44:04.580 --> 44:07.280
and or trademarks.

44:07.280 --> 44:12.440
And a lot of people say in the scene here, they say, how can

44:12.440 --> 44:14.520
you confuse DDR and in the groove?

44:14.520 --> 44:16.060
They're so different.

44:16.060 --> 44:20.840
And to which I say, it's not all about you.

44:20.840 --> 44:22.760
We are a small part.

44:22.760 --> 44:24.000
We're a loyal part.

44:24.000 --> 44:25.040
We're an essential part.

44:25.040 --> 44:28.320
But we're a small part of the dance game music scene.

44:28.320 --> 44:30.160
We really are.

44:30.160 --> 44:32.320
As I was talking about last week when we were talking

44:32.320 --> 44:35.000
Oops, I did it again being on DDR Extreme 2.

44:35.000 --> 44:38.800
The reason why that's there is not for you, it's for the 10-year-old girls having slumber

44:38.800 --> 44:39.800
parties.

44:39.800 --> 44:40.800
Yep.

44:40.800 --> 44:45.680
So, it is the normal person who is having a birthday party in an arcade that doesn't

44:45.680 --> 44:49.400
know the difference any better between one machine to another does think that that game

44:49.400 --> 44:50.400
is DDR.

44:50.400 --> 44:55.000
Case in point, you might remember that our very own Loki, and you know, even though this

44:55.000 --> 44:59.320
was questionable, whatever, actually installed like a step mania thing in a cabinet.

44:59.320 --> 45:00.320
Yeah.

45:00.320 --> 45:04.200
make money off of it which is probably why you know everything you know and it

45:04.200 --> 45:08.720
was only one machine so you know everything whatever and it's gone now so

45:08.720 --> 45:13.400
doesn't matter but he installed step mania and it was reskinned and it had

45:13.400 --> 45:16.960
the mines because it was the newer version of step mania hella stuff it was

45:16.960 --> 45:21.040
different and he put it up and running and we all went to Roseville Golf Land

45:21.040 --> 45:24.280
one day to check it out and I overheard some girl that just looked like she was

45:24.280 --> 45:27.760
there I don't know she said to some person that was there yeah this is the

45:27.760 --> 45:32.860
new DDR let's go play it it wasn't the new DDR it looked like look like DDR

45:32.860 --> 45:37.060
though and it had DDR written on the machine still because they had been too

45:37.060 --> 45:41.020
lazy to put the new marquee up well you know the other thing that I was thinking

45:41.020 --> 45:47.500
that Konami needs to really watch out for is the words the acronym DDR and

45:47.500 --> 45:53.460
dance dance revolution becoming a generic term in the 80s I'm gonna use

45:53.460 --> 46:01.900
Just as an example, Xerox released an ad that said something to the effect of Xerox is not

46:01.900 --> 46:06.740
a generic term, make sure that you're only using Xerox products when you say I'm going

46:06.740 --> 46:07.740
to Xerox something.

46:07.740 --> 46:11.180
Because someone says, I'm going to Xerox something, and you're just going to go over to the copy

46:11.180 --> 46:12.180
machine, right?

46:12.180 --> 46:13.180
Right, right.

46:13.180 --> 46:20.140
Well, you know, the term refrigerator was actually a brand name, and now it's a generic

46:20.140 --> 46:21.140
term.

46:21.140 --> 46:27.820
You know, Frigidaire, that actually has become a household generic.

46:27.820 --> 46:31.580
It's just all, you know, Weed Eater, that's now a generic.

46:31.580 --> 46:37.540
You know, we think of our dancing games, and the first thing that we all think of now is

46:37.540 --> 46:39.540
DDR.

46:39.540 --> 46:45.260
And I think that what it is, another point is that they may not want one per, you know,

46:45.260 --> 46:50.100
the average player to confuse in the group with DDR, to have it become a generic.

46:50.100 --> 46:53.860
That's a very interesting point, and I don't think I've seen that point brought up anywhere

46:53.860 --> 46:54.860
yet.

46:54.860 --> 46:55.860
That's very interesting.

46:55.860 --> 47:03.380
Because actually there were quite a few lawsuits concerning generics that people have actually

47:03.380 --> 47:04.380
lost.

47:04.380 --> 47:05.380
Very good.

47:05.380 --> 47:08.380
Oreo, Kleenex, Band-Aid, Aspirin, Coke, Trojan.

47:08.380 --> 47:12.880
I don't know about Trojan, but the rest of them work.

47:12.880 --> 47:14.420
Thank you guys in chat.

47:14.420 --> 47:15.420
Aspirin was...

47:15.420 --> 47:16.420
That's correct.

47:16.420 --> 47:26.340
Aspirin was a trademark before World War II, you know, okay, another one, you know, Motrin,

47:26.340 --> 47:34.060
now we think of that for Ibuprofen, you know, so many things that we, you know, that we

47:34.060 --> 47:43.140
consider were, they were individual brandings before, DDR is easily going on that path,

47:43.140 --> 47:54.140
Because we think, you know, what's the first thing that you're going to think of when someone starts naming off different dancing games or think, you always still, the average person that's going to go back and think, DDR.

47:54.140 --> 47:57.140
Because that is where it all came from.

47:57.140 --> 48:03.140
Well if Neon FM has anything to say about it when they come out, they might change their mind or pump it up, you know, those guys too.

48:03.140 --> 48:07.140
But Neon FM I think is going about this the right way, they're building their cabinet from scratch.

48:07.140 --> 48:09.140
So they're not going to get the same problem.

48:09.140 --> 48:14.080
And that's why I think that Endemero had a platform to stand on, huh?

48:14.080 --> 48:16.160
Because their machine was unique.

48:16.160 --> 48:23.480
It was the same concept, but I don't think you can sue on a similar concept.

48:23.480 --> 48:26.000
It's very interesting because a lot of folks in the...

48:26.000 --> 48:28.300
This is what I was going to say earlier when I got derailed.

48:28.300 --> 48:32.840
People in the in the Groove scene, they always say, this is not a copy of a game.

48:32.840 --> 48:36.400
You can't say that in the Groove and DDR are the same game because it's like comparing

48:36.400 --> 48:39.140
Sonic to Mario.

48:39.140 --> 48:40.140
And I'm like, no.

48:40.140 --> 48:41.140
I beg to differ.

48:41.140 --> 48:44.260
This is like comparing Mario to Gianna Sisters.

48:44.260 --> 48:46.620
And for those of you that don't know what Gianna Sisters was, it was a game that came

48:46.620 --> 48:52.000
out on the Commodore 64 in, I think, 88 or so, a couple years after Mario was out.

48:52.000 --> 48:56.400
And it was very much like Mario, except they changed it to girls.

48:56.400 --> 48:59.320
But this is the thing, this is the irony.

48:59.320 --> 49:01.840
The music was better in Gianna Sisters.

49:01.840 --> 49:07.460
Giana Sisters had, um, new, like, slightly new elements, but it still had things that

49:07.460 --> 49:10.640
looked like Goombas, and still had things that looked like Turtles, and you still got,

49:10.640 --> 49:13.040
you know, Mushroom-like power-ups.

49:13.040 --> 49:15.440
Giana Sisters lost, and got pulled from the market.

49:15.440 --> 49:17.240
Another point?

49:17.240 --> 49:18.840
Pac-Man and KC Crazy Chase.

49:18.840 --> 49:19.840
Or KC Munchkin, also.

49:19.840 --> 49:20.840
No, it was KC Crazy Chase.

49:20.840 --> 49:22.840
I thought it was KC Munchkin.

49:22.840 --> 49:23.840
Okay.

49:23.840 --> 49:27.460
Um, for people who don't know, there was a system that came out in the early 80s called

49:27.460 --> 49:29.320
The Odyssey 2, which I own one.

49:29.320 --> 49:32.520
I don't have TV to play it. But there was a game that came out called

49:32.520 --> 49:36.640
KC Crazy Chase. And basically it was freaking Pac-Man.

49:36.640 --> 49:41.120
Just, you know, really crappy graphics because they didn't have a way to do

49:41.120 --> 49:44.680
graphics exactly the same as they were in the arcade. You know, not like today where

49:44.680 --> 49:48.300
home games are better. But still, you know,

49:48.300 --> 49:51.980
now they actually pulled a bunch of copies

49:51.980 --> 49:57.500
and destroyed them. So that's why if you happen to see a Odyssey 2 cartridge

49:57.500 --> 50:04.020
for KC Crazy Chase, I suggest you buy it, because that would be holding a piece of gaming

50:04.020 --> 50:05.020
rarity right there.

50:05.020 --> 50:06.020
Very interesting.

50:06.020 --> 50:10.140
One of the resolution pieces that Konami wants is they want these things destroyed.

50:10.140 --> 50:11.600
Yep.

50:11.600 --> 50:15.020
So if In the Groove home version comes out, buy it right away.

50:15.020 --> 50:18.480
No matter how you feel about the game, buy it right away, because it could.

50:18.480 --> 50:21.020
We don't know how this is going to affect the home version, but I do want to point this

50:21.020 --> 50:23.620
out, because a lot of people are saying this is not going to affect the release of the

50:23.620 --> 50:24.620
home version.

50:24.620 --> 50:25.620
I beg to differ.

50:25.620 --> 50:27.960
I think this thing is going to get delayed if nothing else.

50:27.960 --> 50:32.580
I could be wrong, granted as somebody pointed out to me this week when I had a really big

50:32.580 --> 50:34.920
ego and I was like, I called this, I called this.

50:34.920 --> 50:38.160
When they released the home version, they were going to get sued.

50:38.160 --> 50:41.200
Somebody said, Rob, you also said that in the group home version was no way in hell

50:41.200 --> 50:42.200
ever coming out.

50:42.200 --> 50:44.960
I was like, okay, good point.

50:44.960 --> 50:49.480
So if this does come out, it would be interesting, but I could almost say with certainty this

50:49.480 --> 50:51.120
has to get delayed, at least.

50:51.120 --> 50:54.360
Red Octane has got to be scared a little bit right now, or at least waiting to see what

50:54.360 --> 50:55.360
comes next.

50:55.360 --> 51:02.120
If anybody is, I actually would love to get a statement, an official statement from the

51:02.120 --> 51:03.800
folks at Rockstar.

51:03.800 --> 51:08.000
The official statement on, if you go into the Indigrew forums right now, is a locked

51:08.000 --> 51:13.040
thread where somebody said, what's with this lawsuit, and somebody basically said, we have

51:13.040 --> 51:16.840
no comment at this time, we are not discussing legal issues on this forum, all further posts

51:16.840 --> 51:19.800
on this will be deleted, not locked, deleted.

51:19.800 --> 51:22.160
I'm paraphrasing there, that's not the exact quote.

51:22.160 --> 51:27.160
And apparently their attorney has called for silence prior to...

51:27.160 --> 51:31.160
Well, probably they don't know what to do. Remember, the folks that worked on this game...

51:31.160 --> 51:35.160
Now, granted, Roxor Games has been in this a little while before, but with what?

51:35.160 --> 51:37.160
They're a small-scale company.

51:37.160 --> 51:41.160
The folks that made In the Groove were DDR fans to begin with.

51:41.160 --> 51:43.160
They don't know what the hell they've gotten themselves into.

51:43.160 --> 51:45.160
There's got to be a slap in the face to them, too.

51:45.160 --> 51:49.160
They'll never play DDR again, granted, I would assume.

51:49.160 --> 52:00.660
But at the same time, you're paying for that arrogance. I'm sorry. You guys, maybe not necessarily the staff, but you didn't discipline the scene. And the scene has been incredibly arrogant with this whole thing.

52:00.660 --> 52:04.620
Well, and you know, this is, this is, you know, we do a little radio station.

52:04.620 --> 52:10.380
How much research did I put in to see if Orazos was copyrighted in the States?

52:10.380 --> 52:13.700
You know, I did the research for our name.

52:13.700 --> 52:18.060
You know, how are they not going, how are they going to get away with not doing any

52:18.060 --> 52:20.500
research prior to making the product?

52:20.500 --> 52:22.720
That is just good business sense.

52:22.720 --> 52:24.500
Konami also knows about us and they don't care.

52:24.500 --> 52:26.740
Yeah, but we also do good things for Konami.

52:26.740 --> 52:27.740
Yeah, we do.

52:27.740 --> 52:28.740
Yeah.

52:28.740 --> 52:33.740
We talk about them negatively sometimes, but it's fair. Everything's fair, I think, and we do.

52:33.740 --> 52:35.740
We try to bring you both sides of the story.

52:35.740 --> 52:43.740
Exactly. But on top of that, how could they have not, you know, a little bit of homework?

52:43.740 --> 52:50.740
It shouldn't have even required the homework. They should have known that there were patents out and copyrights

52:50.740 --> 52:56.740
not just for the game itself, for the content, there was for concept, there was for the hardware,

52:56.740 --> 53:00.300
hardware there was for everything else involved with it marketing the weird

53:00.300 --> 53:03.500
thing is is there was this giant assumption in the scene that and amiro

53:03.500 --> 53:07.580
held that patent but that was proven wrong when Cutris posted those documents

53:07.580 --> 53:12.460
that clearly show a US patent for the machine the sensors the screen even

53:12.460 --> 53:15.860
though the screen looked a little different everything has a US patent by

53:15.860 --> 53:22.420
Konami not an amiro konami oops well don't you and if they had done their

53:22.420 --> 53:26.620
homework they would have found that out and actually and there are online patent

53:26.620 --> 53:55.140
I don't know how I feel about people being stupid.

53:55.140 --> 53:58.780
I have no mercy to people who do stupid stuff.

53:58.780 --> 53:59.860
You know what, though?

53:59.860 --> 54:04.700
I give them a little leeway because they were probably told it was okay by somebody who

54:04.700 --> 54:05.700
didn't do the work.

54:05.700 --> 54:06.700
No.

54:06.700 --> 54:09.140
When you're doing business, you do not trust on what you are told.

54:09.140 --> 54:10.380
You do the research yourself.

54:10.380 --> 54:11.380
But they've never...

54:11.380 --> 54:14.820
You know, I understand that, but this is unfortunately a tough lesson learned because these people

54:14.820 --> 54:16.740
didn't ever get into it before.

54:16.740 --> 54:17.740
You know?

54:17.740 --> 54:18.740
It's their first time.

54:18.740 --> 54:22.900
This whole thing, think about it, you've created this game from the ground up and suddenly

54:22.900 --> 54:27.900
Somebody wants to buy it, put it in arcades, release it on the PS2, all in the scope of a year.

54:27.900 --> 54:30.740
Heads are spinning at the folks who created this game right now.

54:30.740 --> 54:34.220
You know, we all make dumb mistakes.

54:34.220 --> 54:36.700
I still don't think it's excusable.

54:36.700 --> 54:37.660
I do not th-

54:37.660 --> 54:39.140
On top of that,

54:39.140 --> 54:41.300
this should also be on Red Octane's head.

54:41.300 --> 54:43.160
Red Octane should have known better.

54:43.160 --> 54:44.820
They should have known better.

54:44.820 --> 54:47.480
Seeing as how they market, um,

54:47.480 --> 54:49.660
the actual physical

54:49.660 --> 54:51.160
dance pads,

54:51.160 --> 54:54.920
the games they should have known. But software versus hardware.

54:54.920 --> 54:59.160
The lawsuit's not really about it. It is and it isn't about the software. The lawsuit's

54:59.160 --> 55:00.920
specifically not about the software,

55:00.920 --> 55:04.060
but I say it's being done in response to the software.

55:04.060 --> 55:08.760
So I think Red Octane probably, and they're probably right, had the hardware

55:08.760 --> 55:12.280
not been all screwy the way that In the Groove became an arcade, it probably would have

55:12.280 --> 55:13.040
been okay.

55:13.040 --> 55:16.960
So I can't fault them. The only way that they're going to get around at least any

55:16.960 --> 55:21.120
future arcade releases, is they're going to have to build themselves a new cabinet and change their own

55:21.120 --> 55:25.560
face okay our chat room is saying shut up already we're getting confused

55:25.560 --> 55:30.560
there's too much not going on all right yeah get over it first off but okay so

55:30.560 --> 55:35.040
what happens next what do you think what's your predicted resolution of what

55:35.040 --> 55:45.120
will happen the injection is gonna stay I think this is how ideally it should go

55:45.120 --> 55:48.560
and I'm thinking I'm going to do this from the Konami standpoint and then

55:48.560 --> 55:50.860
I'm going to do it from the Roxbury standpoint.

55:50.860 --> 55:55.340
Ideally for Konami, the home release of In the Groove will not happen.

55:55.340 --> 55:59.080
The injunction will stay, because part of this injunction right now is to protect their

55:59.080 --> 56:02.940
interests before there is a court case.

56:02.940 --> 56:05.000
They're going to cease production.

56:05.000 --> 56:10.200
Now I also think that they are going to have to pay X amount of dollar for every In the

56:10.200 --> 56:13.320
Groove kit sold.

56:13.320 --> 56:22.000
they can actually assess punitive damages as well, which are basically like being spanked.

56:22.000 --> 56:24.720
You did a bad thing, we're going to spank you now.

56:24.720 --> 56:35.620
They also have the right to assess profits lost, as in, because these are full Japanese

56:35.620 --> 56:36.620
machines.

56:36.620 --> 56:41.880
Konami of Japan has lost money, and that's essentially how it is because these machines

56:41.880 --> 56:42.880
have to be paid for.

56:42.880 --> 56:45.960
No, but these machines aren't supposed to be, quote unquote, in the U.S.

56:45.960 --> 56:46.960
So what happens there?

56:46.960 --> 56:47.960
That's kind of a gray area.

56:47.960 --> 56:48.960
Could be Roxor saving grays, too.

56:48.960 --> 56:49.960
Who knows?

56:49.960 --> 56:50.960
That could be.

56:50.960 --> 56:55.680
But also, again, as these machines are publicity, that may have cost them in sales of the home

56:55.680 --> 57:00.480
version because they're no longer having that presence to market.

57:00.480 --> 57:07.040
So we're looking at Roxor being sued for punitive damages, which I actually think is going to

57:07.040 --> 57:08.320
go through.

57:08.320 --> 57:14.480
We're going to see them sued for just, you know, the overall copyright infringement.

57:14.480 --> 57:17.280
We're also going to see them sued for loss of profit.

57:17.280 --> 57:19.280
That's how I see it happening.

57:19.280 --> 57:22.840
For Konami, that would be how it should go.

57:22.840 --> 57:28.560
Now, for Rockzor, and again, I'm thinking from a legal standpoint, this might be what

57:28.560 --> 57:35.440
they can get away with, the software may be permissible given that it was built from the

57:35.440 --> 57:41.560
ground up and it there was no this also has to do with a little bit of trade

57:41.560 --> 57:47.720
secret you know but it would have to be proven through some type of reverse

57:47.720 --> 57:52.160
engineering that this is not that the home software is not a complete duplicate

57:52.160 --> 57:59.280
of DDR if they pull that off the home release will still happen now they're

57:59.280 --> 58:03.600
not gonna make it out with the hardware issue they I think can get away with

58:03.600 --> 58:14.600
With releasing future editions, they are going to have to create a unique cabinet and the boards and sell them as a joint unit, the way that Pump It Up goes.

58:15.600 --> 58:16.600
And then any future releases...

58:16.600 --> 58:23.600
Which In The Groove 2 is projected to be anyway, with the Animiro built cabinets and everything, where Animiro knows what they're doing, is involved and wants to be involved and everything.

58:23.600 --> 58:31.600
Any future releases will have to continue to use that platform only and be upgrades for that unit only.

58:31.600 --> 58:37.600
That is the only way that they're going to be able to continue to release any arcade releases.

58:37.600 --> 58:42.600
For the first one, I'm sorry, they're fucked. They're going to have to pay.

58:42.600 --> 58:48.600
And this could ruin them. This seriously could financially ruin them.

58:48.600 --> 58:53.600
This could also, however, put them in a more public light.

58:53.600 --> 58:57.600
A negative event can turn into positive publicity.

58:57.600 --> 59:01.600
That is a very interesting side point, is that a negative event can be publicity.

59:01.600 --> 59:03.600
This whole thing could be publicity for them.

59:03.600 --> 59:08.600
Although, when you look out on the big gaming websites, it's not that huge a deal.

59:08.600 --> 59:12.600
I think most game sites ran a little side story on it, but no major things.

59:12.600 --> 59:16.600
So if they are permitted to release the home version,

59:16.600 --> 59:20.000
If they are permitted to go through within the groove to

59:21.120 --> 59:24.400
With you know this little bit of controversy going on

59:25.240 --> 59:27.240
example Madonna's sex book

59:27.680 --> 59:29.000
Okay

59:29.000 --> 59:32.700
It's the first thing that came in on mine. Okay. They were banned

59:32.700 --> 59:38.880
She was sued all this crap and how popular did that make her? Oh, yeah. Yeah, I

59:39.560 --> 59:42.400
Got to compare in the group did about Donna. That was cool

59:42.400 --> 59:47.240
Here's my, which is funny, and get into the groove, boy, you've got to prove, I still

59:47.240 --> 59:48.240
think of that song every time I see it.

59:48.240 --> 59:50.080
Isn't there a song that's public domain now?

59:50.080 --> 59:52.240
Maybe, I don't know.

59:52.240 --> 59:54.320
I'm kind of similar to your thoughts on this.

59:54.320 --> 59:59.800
I think that, but I'm a little, because I think this lawsuit is a direct response to

59:59.800 --> 01:00:04.960
the home release, I think that the home release, and I could be wrong, I think the home release

01:00:04.960 --> 01:00:05.960
will be affected.

01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:08.120
I think as part of this, I don't think this is going to go to court.

01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:11.920
I think Rockstar and Konami are going to settle, and I think as part of the terms, they're

01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:15.240
They're gonna recall, but I doubt any of them will be recalled, really.

01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:17.960
They're gonna recall the box or kits or whatever.

01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:24.880
I think that In the Groove will be stopped or delayed heavily, and Konami will be given

01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:28.080
a chunk of the profit from the game.

01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:32.040
And I think also as part of it, I bet you anything, they're gonna have to settle where

01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:33.720
they can't really market the game.

01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:35.740
It's gonna have to come out quietly.

01:00:35.740 --> 01:00:36.740
But who knows?

01:00:36.740 --> 01:00:39.480
I mean, that, I might just be thinking crazy, but I think that's probably what's gonna happen.

01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:44.120
I think though, now this is my other crazy prediction, now tape me in case I'm right.

01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:49.140
I think In the Groove 2 will still come out in arcades under a new name.

01:00:49.140 --> 01:00:51.260
I don't think it'll be called In the Groove 2 anymore.

01:00:51.260 --> 01:00:53.420
There's also the other thing.

01:00:53.420 --> 01:00:59.320
Konami could obtain any rights to the In the Groove franchise.

01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:00.320
There's also that.

01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:02.020
We'll see.

01:01:02.020 --> 01:01:09.020
and therefore, again, receive a percentage of the profits.

01:01:09.020 --> 01:01:13.780
Alright, I'm done. I don't want to talk about the lawsuit right now anymore. I'm done with

01:01:13.780 --> 01:01:19.960
my side of the story. Honestly, when all is said and done, I just...we'll let the courts

01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:25.320
figure it out. We're all trying to be lawyers right now. The truth is, we don't really know

01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:28.820
everything going on because we're not behind the closed doors right now. We don't know

01:01:28.820 --> 01:01:33.360
know what Rockstar's side of the case is, so we can't really make judgments. But I want

01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:37.460
to kind of close this segment with this thought. Those of you guys that are saying boycott

01:01:37.460 --> 01:01:42.640
Konami over this, shut the fuck up. Seriously. There would have been no In the Groove if

01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:47.240
it wasn't for DDR. I mean, that is a case and point. Absolutely there would have never

01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:52.860
been In the Groove if it wasn't for DDR. Konami has not abandoned their US audience. Konami

01:01:52.860 --> 01:01:57.280
of Japan, eh, maybe. But you know what? People in Konami of America are working their ass

01:01:57.280 --> 01:02:03.620
off to bring you three new games at E3 this year. Seriously, shut up. Boycotting Konami

01:02:03.620 --> 01:02:09.220
is not going to do anything. Honestly, go ahead and boycott, get off my machine. Shorter

01:02:09.220 --> 01:02:13.900
line for... The five of you who would be boycotting this, you're not going to make a dent. Sorry,

01:02:13.900 --> 01:02:17.180
it's not going to work. Go ahead and, we're probably just adding fuel to their fire, I

01:02:17.180 --> 01:02:22.980
don't care. Your little boycott... You have no respect for where you got your game from.

01:02:22.980 --> 01:02:28.300
says that if they do some stupid little boycott that's just gonna open the door

01:02:28.300 --> 01:02:35.320
for me oh why oh well I need to see what this is you're helping sorry you know

01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:38.900
and it honestly if you want to make a point get the hell off the DDR boards

01:02:38.900 --> 01:02:43.340
and start one for in the group I think in the group two will happen under a new

01:02:43.340 --> 01:02:49.020
name so go go figure that one out you go back to spider stomp get out your power

01:02:49.020 --> 01:02:56.020
We'll be back after this break. Your calls on this whole thing. Your calls on the whole

01:02:56.020 --> 01:03:03.020
whole thing when we come back after this.

01:03:26.020 --> 01:03:33.020
Far away on the other side, she was caught in the middle of the desert fire

01:03:33.020 --> 01:03:36.020
And she couldn't find how to push through

01:03:36.020 --> 01:03:40.020
A dream that was full in the evening

01:03:40.020 --> 01:03:44.020
Carried away by a moonlight shed, shed of stone

01:03:44.020 --> 01:03:47.020
The sorrow and grieving

01:03:47.020 --> 01:03:51.020
Carried away by a moonlight shed, shed of stone

01:03:51.020 --> 01:03:54.020
Oh, what's the feeling when it comes?

01:03:54.020 --> 01:03:57.020
Far away on the other side

01:03:57.020 --> 01:04:00.520
He was shot six times by a man on the run

01:04:00.520 --> 01:04:04.520
And she couldn't find how he pushed through

01:04:04.520 --> 01:04:07.520
I said, I said, I prayed

01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:11.020
I need you in heaven one day

01:04:11.020 --> 01:04:14.520
Falling in the morning

01:04:14.520 --> 01:04:18.020
Carried away by a moonlight shed

01:04:18.020 --> 01:04:21.520
I watched your vision burning

01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:24.120
Get in the way, by the moonlight

01:04:54.120 --> 01:05:00.120
This is the end of the video, thank you so much for watching, and I'll see you in the next one.

01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:26.120
Why?

01:05:30.120 --> 01:05:32.120
Why?

01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:37.120
Why?

01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:43.120
Why?

01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:48.120
Why?

01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:51.120
Why?

01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:55.120
and

01:05:55.120 --> 01:05:59.120
and

01:05:59.120 --> 01:06:03.120
and

01:06:03.120 --> 01:06:07.120
and

01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:11.120
and

01:06:11.120 --> 01:06:15.120
and

01:06:15.120 --> 01:06:19.120
on

01:10:19.120 --> 01:10:20.120
Hey!

01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:21.120
Hey!

01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:22.120
Hey!

01:10:22.120 --> 01:10:23.120
Hey!

01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:24.120
Hey!

01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:25.120
Hey!

01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:26.120
Hey!

01:10:26.120 --> 01:10:27.120
Hey!

01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:28.120
Hey!

01:10:28.120 --> 01:10:33.120
...

01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:38.120
...

01:10:38.120 --> 01:10:43.120
...

01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:48.120
...

01:10:48.120 --> 01:10:53.120
...

01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:43.560
Easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song, Orange Lounge Radio.

01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:47.800
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:11:47.800 --> 01:11:49.220
Hope you enjoyed that break.

01:11:49.220 --> 01:11:54.900
We had some music there from DJ Amuro with A, or Ace,

01:11:54.900 --> 01:11:56.220
however you want to call it.

01:11:56.220 --> 01:12:00.980
And also on that break, we had a little bit of Naoki with Blue

01:12:00.980 --> 01:12:02.620
Impulse, or Aoi Shado.

01:12:02.620 --> 01:12:05.100
Before that, Tak, Electro-Tune, starting to set off.

01:12:05.100 --> 01:12:06.340
Tako Ryu.

01:12:06.340 --> 01:12:07.940
Whatever, Tako Tak, same to me.

01:12:07.940 --> 01:12:09.780
Ryu and Star Mine, starting to set off.

01:12:09.780 --> 01:12:11.220
We're going to go right in to taking some

01:12:11.220 --> 01:12:12.700
calls on the Skype line.

01:12:12.700 --> 01:12:16.180

Click on interact with us and get the more information on the skype line.

01:12:20.580 --> 01:12:21.580
What?

01:12:21.580 --> 01:12:22.580
Yes, Dark Sakura?

01:12:22.580 --> 01:12:23.580
I'm sorry.

01:12:23.580 --> 01:12:26.100
I'm just marveling at how delicious this black cherry soda is.

01:12:26.100 --> 01:12:27.100
All right.

01:12:27.100 --> 01:12:28.100
Let's get to our first call.

01:12:28.100 --> 01:12:29.100
Hello?

01:12:29.100 --> 01:12:30.100
Caller, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:12:30.100 --> 01:12:31.100
Boo.

01:12:31.100 --> 01:12:32.100
Boo!

01:12:32.100 --> 01:12:33.100
Who's this?

01:12:33.100 --> 01:12:36.580
Oh, don't play dumb, Rob.

01:12:36.580 --> 01:12:37.580
Come on.

01:12:37.580 --> 01:12:38.580
Okay.

01:12:38.580 --> 01:12:39.580
Fine.

01:12:39.580 --> 01:12:42.580
I previously arranged this call with Cutress from DDR Freak.

01:12:42.580 --> 01:12:43.580
How are you, sir?

01:12:43.580 --> 01:12:44.580
Not too bad.

01:12:44.580 --> 01:12:45.580
How about you?

01:12:45.580 --> 01:12:51.320
Good, um, you know exhausted after that hour hour of bitching and complaining about the lawsuit

01:12:51.320 --> 01:12:54.200
But that's nothing compared to what's going on on DDR free gay

01:12:55.840 --> 01:13:00.480
Yeah, my brain has been broken repaired several times trying to go through that thread

01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:06.480
I I've sworn off posting in a couple of times and then and ended up having to come back to correct people yet again

01:13:07.100 --> 01:13:09.960
How many warning points would you say you've given out in that thread?

01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:14.400
actually, I think I've only dished out two different warnings and

01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:20.640
And one of them, somebody is complaining about incessantly because he says that it wasn't

01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:22.120
merited at all.

01:13:22.120 --> 01:13:27.480
He said that basically the reason the lawsuit existed was that they were about to put out

01:13:27.480 --> 01:13:33.240
a new arcade version and that he saw something about it in a California arcade.

01:13:33.240 --> 01:13:37.640
Somebody's showing him pictures on a laptop and I'm just like, how exactly do you think

01:13:37.640 --> 01:13:38.640
that's legitimate?

01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:40.560
Yeah, that's a little weird.

01:13:40.560 --> 01:13:43.920
Or it kind of goes back to when somebody had called in, I don't remember if it was last

01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:47.680
week or the week before talking about somebody had posted in their live journal that, I don't

01:13:47.680 --> 01:13:53.800
know, their uncle's sister's brother had posted something about the new machine is coming

01:13:53.800 --> 01:13:54.800
out for sure this year.

01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:59.400
Oh, no, I think that was Cucumber. I think he said they were gearing up for a location

01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:00.560
test in September.

01:14:00.560 --> 01:14:05.920
You know, no offense against the dude, but, I mean, why should I believe him, I guess

01:14:05.920 --> 01:14:10.200
is what I'm saying. I mean, no offense, but why should I believe him?

01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:16.200
Yeah, I don't really have any idea what kind of trust he gets in the community,

01:14:16.200 --> 01:14:23.200
although nobody seems to have been debunking it over at Air and in Japan, where everyone's elite.

01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:25.200
Who knows?

01:14:25.200 --> 01:14:27.200
Right on. So what are your thoughts on this whole thing?

01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:32.200
I remember that you were the one that actually dug up what really happens.

01:14:32.200 --> 01:14:35.200
What did you think as you were reading it all?

01:14:35.200 --> 01:14:39.560
I guess I have a little bit of an interest in it to begin with because I've kind of taken

01:14:39.560 --> 01:14:44.800
it as a personal cause to be debunking all of these rumors with the history of the series

01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:46.800
and everything.

01:14:46.800 --> 01:14:49.280
That and the Miro, those and the Miro's rumors and stuff?

01:14:49.280 --> 01:14:50.280
Oh yeah.

01:14:50.280 --> 01:14:52.280
They bugged the hell out of me.

01:14:52.280 --> 01:14:57.160
Yeah, I just, I really can't believe that people would think that as part of settling

01:14:57.160 --> 01:15:04.240
a lawsuit where you have the upper hand that you would offer to back out of the business

01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:06.000
market and not go back.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.880
Exactly, exactly.

01:15:08.880 --> 01:15:13.000
So what do you think is going to happen of this whole thing?

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.600
Do you think Konami has RockSore's nuts here?

01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:18.640
Or what do you think might happen as of this?

01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:21.200
Well, I could see it going a couple of different ways.

01:15:21.200 --> 01:15:26.680
I think the odds are definitely not in RockSore's favor.

01:15:26.680 --> 01:15:31.360
But this happens to be one special case.

01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:33.240
I'm not generally the sort of person

01:15:33.240 --> 01:15:36.920
that seems to be privy to inside information or anything like that.

01:15:36.920 --> 01:15:39.400
Usually I'm always hearing about things after the fact.

01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:43.800
So not only not only was I happy to find out about this before anyone else,

01:15:43.800 --> 01:15:47.800
since I got word directly from ZipTie over at Konami.

01:15:48.240 --> 01:15:53.800
But basically, there's a couple of things that we've learned

01:15:53.800 --> 01:15:57.520
which could end up turning this entire thing on its ear.

01:15:57.680 --> 01:16:00.880
So I wouldn't have any preconceived notions

01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:05.880
with regards to how this is going to go, all the fanboys need to die right now.

01:16:05.880 --> 01:16:10.880
So you, if I'm hearing you right,

01:16:10.880 --> 01:16:15.880
you say that there are things that we don't know about that could turn this whole thing upside down.

01:16:15.880 --> 01:16:20.880
Yeah, and I'm not saying that's going to tilt it in any one direction or the other.

01:16:20.880 --> 01:16:25.880
It's just, well basically

01:16:25.880 --> 01:16:30.980
it's going to end up being the equivalent, I think, of somebody running in the courtroom and saying,

01:16:30.980 --> 01:16:34.180
Kanami, I am your father.

01:16:34.180 --> 01:16:35.480
Very interesting.

01:16:35.480 --> 01:16:39.280
No! That's not possible!

01:16:39.280 --> 01:16:46.180
Which is basically the same thing I say about all the in-the-groove fanboys that want to disown in-the-groove from DDR.

01:16:46.180 --> 01:16:53.480
Basically, Kanami just comes over and says, no, Roxor, I am your father.

01:16:53.480 --> 01:16:56.480
And that's exactly what I was saying about those people that are like,

01:16:56.480 --> 01:17:01.480
oh my god, boycott Konami because they're evil assholes and da da da da da da.

01:17:01.480 --> 01:17:05.480
You know, if someone stole your shit and then repainted it a different color and put it out,

01:17:05.480 --> 01:17:07.480
you'd probably be pretty pissed off too.

01:17:07.480 --> 01:17:11.480
You know, even if you turned your head and forgot about it for a few years or whatever.

01:17:11.480 --> 01:17:16.480
It just irritates me. That attitude irritates me.

01:17:16.480 --> 01:17:20.480
I think you've even said something along the lines before about how with the community,

01:17:20.480 --> 01:17:24.160
It's DDR when it's convenient, and it's not DDR when it's convenient.

01:17:24.160 --> 01:17:28.960
Yes, thank you. I have said that quote about the way in the groove people feel is that

01:17:28.960 --> 01:17:33.120
it's DDR when it's convenient for it to be DDR when it's like, you know, trying to get it more

01:17:33.120 --> 01:17:37.440
exposure or people are trying to explain the game. Well, it's like DDR. But then, you know,

01:17:37.440 --> 01:17:40.720
heaven forbid something like this comes up and it's like, oh my God, there's nothing like DDR.

01:17:40.720 --> 01:17:43.600
It's a completely different game. It's Mario and Sonic.

01:17:44.320 --> 01:17:47.840
Yeah, I want to completely underscore something you said earlier.

01:17:47.840 --> 01:17:48.240
Okay.

01:17:48.240 --> 01:17:49.440
Just to make this clear.

01:17:49.440 --> 01:17:50.400
Good. That'll make me feel good.

01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:56.400
I have not had a chance to play In The Groove yet. I am very much looking forward to my chance.

01:17:56.400 --> 01:18:03.400
It looks really nice to me. I saw some people playing it at Anime Boston last month when I was in town for that.

01:18:03.400 --> 01:18:07.400
And it looks very slick. It has some very good production quality.

01:18:07.400 --> 01:18:13.400
I think that all the new modifiers and everything, yeah, there's StepMania, but give me a bit.

01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:19.640
a bit. I think it's something that DER has needed for a while. Basically, it expands

01:18:19.640 --> 01:18:23.780
on DER quite a bit and I really appreciate that. I think it's really nice to carry the

01:18:23.780 --> 01:18:28.620
torch for the series. The only thing that's ever really stopped me from having any serious

01:18:28.620 --> 01:18:32.560
interest in the game is the community. There are some really good people there. I've talked

01:18:32.560 --> 01:18:37.040
to several of the Rock Store employees and do talk to them on a regular basis and they're

01:18:37.040 --> 01:18:42.960
really great guys. There are some people in the community that just really need their

01:18:42.960 --> 01:18:44.780
sticks pulled out of their ass?

01:18:44.780 --> 01:18:50.760
Their representation on the internet sucks, sadly for them, because I'll tell you, at

01:18:50.760 --> 01:18:54.960
that in the group, I was kind of like wincing walking in the door of that in the group from

01:18:54.960 --> 01:18:58.000
your party because I thought people were going to beat me down with sticks, but then I realized

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:01.360
nobody listens to this show, so I was okay with it, but I still thought that I was going

01:19:01.360 --> 01:19:10.000
to be confronted with just extreme assholism, but actually, I met wonderful people, I had

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:14.000
I had a great time at the show, and I'm not just saying that because there was free booze and stuff.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:20.000
I had a great time, great people. I would have never guessed that this could have been about In the Groove based on the people I met.

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:28.000
Because from the representation on the internet, I was expecting to just walk into Melrose Place.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:35.000
Yeah, I think part of the problem is just that the people that are really big fans of In the Groove these days

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:40.540
were, in some ways, really resentful of Konami for having, quote-unquote, abandoned them.

01:19:40.540 --> 01:19:45.900
And so, now they're being rebellious teenagers, rebellious teenagers, if it were.

01:19:45.900 --> 01:19:50.060
Do you think that that might be more fuel on this boycott fire, where if they feel abandoned

01:19:50.060 --> 01:19:55.660
by Konami, and now for Konami to suddenly go, wait a minute, even though I abandoned you,

01:19:55.660 --> 01:19:58.740
I'm going to, you know, beat this, you know, I'm going to sue this other game that's come

01:19:58.740 --> 01:19:59.740
out?

01:19:59.740 --> 01:20:02.980
Yeah, that's exactly it. It's feeding right into it.

01:20:02.980 --> 01:20:07.620
Why do people completely ignore the home versions? That's what I'm wondering.

01:20:07.620 --> 01:20:12.580
Well, uh, it's probably for a minor reason because of the differences with the hardware.

01:20:12.580 --> 01:20:16.980
You know, it's just not as easy to play at home sometimes, even if you've got a cobalt

01:20:16.980 --> 01:20:18.780
plus. Especially in the groove, thank you.

01:20:18.780 --> 01:20:22.740
Especially when you stay still. Yeah. Uh, I mean, basically, yeah, there's

01:20:22.740 --> 01:20:26.460
no bar to rave. Exactly. Although, I swear to God, Red Octane

01:20:26.460 --> 01:20:30.460
is thinking about doing one. They're trying to see how they can do one at a good price.

01:20:30.460 --> 01:20:33.420
I mean, they're going to have to to support in the groove.

01:20:33.420 --> 01:20:36.460
Your groove bar, 2.0.

01:20:36.460 --> 01:20:38.660
Yeah, I'm really glad that they're

01:20:38.660 --> 01:20:41.800
adding the novice system to the home version,

01:20:41.800 --> 01:20:43.840
because that is something that appears

01:20:43.840 --> 01:20:45.340
to be greatly neglected.

01:20:45.340 --> 01:20:47.980
I haven't looked over a lot of the step charts myself,

01:20:47.980 --> 01:20:51.540
but I did get the impression that not a whole lot of pain

01:20:51.540 --> 01:20:56.460
was put into making of the light and standard steps.

01:20:56.460 --> 01:20:58.980
Forgive me for not remembering the correct difficulty

01:20:58.980 --> 01:21:00.220
specifiers here.

01:21:00.220 --> 01:21:04.740
But basically, that's something that I know, personally, the

01:21:04.740 --> 01:21:08.340
step authors for Ultramix 2 put a lot of effort into.

01:21:08.340 --> 01:21:10.180
They wanted to make sure that it was going to be fun to

01:21:10.180 --> 01:21:13.380
dance and play, regardless of what level you're on.

01:21:13.380 --> 01:21:16.340
I mean, there are quite a few songs I can think of on Trick,

01:21:16.340 --> 01:21:18.820
which are perfectly fun to play, and I don't have to be

01:21:18.820 --> 01:21:20.660
doing a seven or eight foot.

01:21:20.660 --> 01:21:23.560
I think a lot of the reason, too, that the Ultramix 2 steps

01:21:23.560 --> 01:21:28.060
were so darn good was because Ultramix 1 really screwed some

01:21:28.060 --> 01:21:33.140
steps up especially when it came to the song packs so I think they like really

01:21:33.140 --> 01:21:36.420
learned from their mistakes and they almost like overcompensated the steps

01:21:36.420 --> 01:21:44.900
were so damn good I mean really no yeah we all win from that I guess hmm so I

01:21:44.900 --> 01:21:50.060
guess it's gonna be a very interesting e3 if that cuz if I don't know if rock

01:21:50.060 --> 01:21:53.580
store is what I haven't checked the e3 list but I'm sure red octane is one of

01:21:53.580 --> 01:21:57.140
the scheduled exhibitors it's gonna be very interesting I want to go by their

01:21:57.140 --> 01:22:00.300
booth wednesday morning and see if there's any mention of in the group

01:22:00.300 --> 01:22:02.040
i think it'd be very interesting

01:22:02.040 --> 01:22:02.840
what do you think

01:22:02.840 --> 01:22:06.480
was going to come in three from that those companies

01:22:06.480 --> 01:22:11.960
i haven't heard the latest word i'm sure michael when passes that

01:22:11.960 --> 01:22:13.280
has to do with rather

01:22:13.280 --> 01:22:14.460
book right now

01:22:14.460 --> 01:22:18.160
but last i heard yes they were going to have any three present

01:22:18.160 --> 01:22:22.680
and all also not only are we going to be you know heading over to the red octane

01:22:22.680 --> 01:22:29.640
booth and also the Konami booth, but I'm trying to make arrangements with MadCats right now,

01:22:29.640 --> 01:22:35.160
and I know some of you are probably just groaning or gritting your teeth now, but yeah, we're

01:22:35.160 --> 01:22:39.320
going to be going over there so that we can take a look at the forthcoming release of

01:22:39.320 --> 01:22:40.320
Pump It Up Exceed.

01:22:40.320 --> 01:22:43.520
Yeah, I was going to hit on this a little later in the show, I'll go into more detail

01:22:43.520 --> 01:22:48.120
later, but you're right, MadCats has announced that they are going to be the ones publishing,

01:22:48.120 --> 01:22:50.680
and you're right, the cringe was the first thing I did.

01:22:50.680 --> 01:22:56.740
my very first thought was, I hope they don't fuck it up like they did their GameCube release.

01:22:56.740 --> 01:23:00.340
But luckily they aren't writing it, so it's hard for them, I mean Mastiff I guess is the

01:23:00.340 --> 01:23:04.660
ones writing it, and TechnicBeat was cool, so, but I just, I'm like, oh god Mad Cats,

01:23:04.660 --> 01:23:08.060
oh god. To kiss of death.

01:23:08.060 --> 01:23:13.540
I don't have a whole lot of background in the Pump It Up scene, I actually have an exceed

01:23:13.540 --> 01:23:17.480
in a movie theater about an hour from me and that's all that I've really played of it,

01:23:17.480 --> 01:23:24.360
But CJ Iwakura made a post on our thread on DDR Freak where he basically had indicated

01:23:24.360 --> 01:23:29.400
that the bundled pad is going to be the exact same one that came out with the Konami release.

01:23:29.400 --> 01:23:35.800
So regardless of the fact that it is Mad Catz publishing the game, hopefully those of you

01:23:35.800 --> 01:23:39.200
who are pumpers out there won't have anything really to worry about.

01:23:39.200 --> 01:23:40.200
Phew.

01:23:40.200 --> 01:23:45.160
I mean, but I don't know, I'm still a little nervous about having to buy a new dance pad

01:23:45.160 --> 01:23:48.160
just because the arrows are all different and stuff anyway which is why

01:23:48.160 --> 01:23:51.040
in the groove had it been released on the home would have been kind of a nice

01:23:51.040 --> 01:23:54.040
addition to the library but we'll pump it up it's like great I got to get another

01:23:54.040 --> 01:24:00.240
mat but if it's a good solid mat then you know and it's it's a reasonable

01:24:00.240 --> 01:24:03.760
price which I think $60 is what they're currently asking for it is is somewhat

01:24:03.760 --> 01:24:07.280
reasonable concern excuse me considering everything you get them yeah I'll

01:24:07.280 --> 01:24:10.800
probably check it out yeah I think that's about the standard price because

01:24:10.800 --> 01:24:14.560
if I remember correctly the DDR bundles that Konami has been putting out lately

01:24:14.560 --> 01:24:18.440
with the Mark II soft pad, those are $60, I'm pretty sure.

01:24:18.440 --> 01:24:20.800
Yeah, they're about $60 as well.

01:24:20.800 --> 01:24:22.560
Well, anything else you want to share with us,

01:24:22.560 --> 01:24:24.560
Cutrus, very interesting perspective.

01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:25.800
Enjoy having you on the show.

01:24:25.800 --> 01:24:27.800
You've got to call in more often, buddy.

01:24:27.800 --> 01:24:30.400
Well, now that I actually have a working setup, perhaps

01:24:30.400 --> 01:24:31.400
I'll do just that.

01:24:31.400 --> 01:24:32.080
There you go.

01:24:32.080 --> 01:24:34.560
You should, let's meet up at E3, so you're going

01:24:34.560 --> 01:24:36.280
to be going next week, right?

01:24:36.280 --> 01:24:37.960
Absolutely.

01:24:37.960 --> 01:24:40.480
I don't know if Shane gave you the schedule or anything

01:24:40.480 --> 01:24:42.640
that we've kind of got tentative so far,

01:24:42.640 --> 01:24:48.160
but I definitely want to make sure that I get to hang out with you guys a lot.

01:24:48.160 --> 01:24:53.600
I have heard the DDR Freak mod schedule loosely what's going on obviously because Dark Sakura

01:24:53.600 --> 01:24:54.600
is a big part of that.

01:24:54.600 --> 01:24:58.240
I don't know if that includes you and Shane or what, but send me an email, we'll work

01:24:58.240 --> 01:24:59.240
something out.

01:24:59.240 --> 01:25:00.240
Absolutely.

01:25:00.240 --> 01:25:06.040
One more quick question before we go, non-music game related thing you're most looking forward

01:25:06.040 --> 01:25:08.040
to seeing at E3?

01:25:08.040 --> 01:25:19.040
Well, if you had said non-Bimani, then I probably could have answered that right off, because I'm really demanding some information about Jam with the Band.

01:25:19.040 --> 01:25:26.040
But I guess in that vein, I'm really looking forward to whatever Nintendo has set up for the DS.

01:25:26.040 --> 01:25:35.040
Since I'm not sure if they're going to be offering downloadables for some of their games, or if they're just going to be sending out demos for like Mario Kart DS and whatnot.

01:25:35.040 --> 01:25:39.720
Yeah, I have a feeling it's going to be download demos and maybe like you can get some crappy

01:25:39.720 --> 01:25:44.040
puzzles for Pallarium or something like download as well, but I think the majority of it will

01:25:44.040 --> 01:25:48.480
probably be demos because the way E3 is, you know, you sometimes have to wait in line to

01:25:48.480 --> 01:25:50.280
play the games.

01:25:50.280 --> 01:25:52.880
How great is it going to be to just be able to download it and play it on your own damn

01:25:52.880 --> 01:25:53.880
DS?

01:25:53.880 --> 01:25:54.880
I think that's going to be neat.

01:25:54.880 --> 01:25:58.080
Yeah, that's going to be absolutely fantastic, you know, not to have to wait in line.

01:25:58.080 --> 01:26:02.640
And just because of the way this is working, I'm not taking any chances here.

01:26:02.640 --> 01:26:07.760
I'm bringing both mine and my wife's DS with me and all the games, so I'm totally

01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:08.760
confiscating all of that.

01:26:08.760 --> 01:26:10.520
You're all ready to go.

01:26:10.520 --> 01:26:11.520
You're all ready to go.

01:26:11.520 --> 01:26:12.520
Absolutely.

01:26:12.520 --> 01:26:13.520
I'm going to bring all my stuff too.

01:26:13.520 --> 01:26:15.280
So, we'll have to have a DS War or something.

01:26:15.280 --> 01:26:18.440
I'm bringing my 8th style because I must hunt my hero down.

01:26:18.440 --> 01:26:19.880
Oh, Akira, if he's there?

01:26:19.880 --> 01:26:20.880
If he's there.

01:26:20.880 --> 01:26:21.880
I hope so.

01:26:21.880 --> 01:26:23.440
Loki has said he's bringing his PSP.

01:26:23.440 --> 01:26:26.800
He's not taking any chances because he knows PSP's online and says they could have something

01:26:26.800 --> 01:26:27.800
surprising.

01:26:27.800 --> 01:26:28.800
I'm bringing my PSP too.

01:26:28.800 --> 01:26:32.200
I said, you're a brave man to bring all that crap with you to LA, especially after my car

01:26:32.200 --> 01:26:37.900
All right, buddy, well, I'm going to let you go so we can get some more calls, but thank

01:26:37.900 --> 01:26:41.640
you very much for calling in, and we'll see you at E3, all right?

01:26:41.640 --> 01:26:42.640
Yes, sir.

01:26:42.640 --> 01:26:43.640
Thanks for having me.

01:26:43.640 --> 01:26:44.640
All right.

01:26:44.640 --> 01:26:45.640
Have a good one, buddy.

01:26:45.640 --> 01:26:46.640
Bye-bye.

01:26:46.640 --> 01:26:47.640
You, too.

01:26:47.640 --> 01:26:54.720
Tetris from DDR Freak, www.ddrfreak.com, also the home of our replays that we do Friday

01:26:54.720 --> 01:26:56.960
nights over on DDR Freak Radio, so check it out.

01:26:56.960 --> 01:27:00.900
They've been very supportive of us in about the past year or so, so, well, you know, really

01:27:00.900 --> 01:27:05.460
ever since the beginning, but just even more so, like I've really been feeling the love

01:27:05.460 --> 01:27:10.220
the past year, so it's great. Let's move on, let's take another call. This person's been

01:27:10.220 --> 01:27:15.180
calling in for like an hour now. Sorry dude, what's up? Hi, you're on Orange Lounge. Yeah,

01:27:15.180 --> 01:27:21.660
this is SSJ100 Matt in Separoth 1215. Two of you? Ahh! Amazing, I don't know if we can

01:27:21.660 --> 01:27:25.300
handle that much input, but we'll try. What's up, what's your guys' thoughts on the lawsuit?

01:27:25.300 --> 01:27:31.620
Well, I don't know, I think Roxor had this coming, I think they planned it out already,

01:27:31.620 --> 01:27:32.620
so.

01:27:32.620 --> 01:27:37.740
Wait, so you think Roxor, are you saying this whole thing is just, is smoke and mirrors

01:27:37.740 --> 01:27:41.300
and that Roxor has planned this all along?

01:27:41.300 --> 01:27:45.860
I don't know, they can't be this stupid, they had to have known this was going to happen.

01:27:45.860 --> 01:27:50.180
I'm going to go back to what I said earlier about Roxor's lawyers, I think they, when

01:27:50.180 --> 01:27:55.180
they were clearing everything and seeing if everything was okay with this, they were probably

01:27:55.180 --> 01:27:59.420
focusing on the software element of it, because you have to admit, the software looks a lot

01:27:59.420 --> 01:28:04.220
like DDR, and they weren't focusing enough on the hardware part of it, and somebody really,

01:28:04.220 --> 01:28:06.260
really fucked up.

01:28:06.260 --> 01:28:07.260
But...

01:28:07.260 --> 01:28:08.260
Someone didn't get the memo.

01:28:08.260 --> 01:28:09.260
Yeah, someone didn't get the memo.

01:28:09.260 --> 01:28:10.260
I don't know.

01:28:10.260 --> 01:28:11.260
But I could be wrong.

01:28:11.260 --> 01:28:12.260
We'll see.

01:28:12.260 --> 01:28:13.260
We'll see.

01:28:13.260 --> 01:28:16.360
Unfortunately, the community has been too arrogant to fill me in any other way, so...

01:28:16.360 --> 01:28:22.220
Got their head shoved way up their asses to the point that they're tasting, like, tonsil

01:28:22.220 --> 01:28:23.220
or something.

01:28:23.220 --> 01:28:28.020
I know, but this whole thing kind of sucks that people who pre-owned it like Sephiroth

01:28:28.020 --> 01:28:29.020
right over here.

01:28:29.020 --> 01:28:33.860
Oh, yeah, that folks that pre-ordered it from Red Octane have no idea what's going to happen?

01:28:33.860 --> 01:28:34.860
Mm-hmm.

01:28:34.860 --> 01:28:35.860
Yeah, I know.

01:28:35.860 --> 01:28:36.860
That's got to be kind of weird.

01:28:36.860 --> 01:28:39.660
In fact, somebody was actually mentioning to me in the chat room in private message.

01:28:39.660 --> 01:28:42.820
I hope Dark Knight doesn't mind me reading this, but he said that he actually went over

01:28:42.820 --> 01:28:47.740
to a GameStop Sunday, and they told him it's going to come out May 26th, and no info from

01:28:47.740 --> 01:28:49.780
the lawsuit had reached them yet about it.

01:28:49.780 --> 01:28:58.780
But I say don't hold your breath, because GameStop, electronic fatigue and stuff, never write with this crap, especially when things are getting delayed.

01:28:58.780 --> 01:29:02.780
Sorry, but you cannot count on that May 26 date.

01:29:02.780 --> 01:29:04.780
I'll have the word as soon as GameStop gets it.

01:29:04.780 --> 01:29:11.780
Yeah, because you have the luxury of being with the manager of the GameStop and everything, but yeah, definitely.

01:29:11.780 --> 01:29:15.780
Well, now GameStop's owned EB, so...

01:29:15.780 --> 01:29:17.780
Well, that's true.

01:29:17.780 --> 01:29:18.780
Yeah.

01:29:18.780 --> 01:29:21.780
But that was pretty cool.

01:29:21.780 --> 01:29:22.780
Any other thoughts on the lawsuit?

01:29:22.780 --> 01:29:25.780
Any other things you want to share with us?

01:29:25.780 --> 01:29:26.780
Nope.

01:29:26.780 --> 01:29:31.780
It's good to be home back in New York and have a good time.

01:29:31.780 --> 01:29:32.780
One of these days we're going to get back.

01:29:32.780 --> 01:29:37.780
Actually, I am looking at another East Coast trip within the next, oh, I don't know, six

01:29:37.780 --> 01:29:38.780
months.

01:29:38.780 --> 01:29:40.780
I'll be going back to the East Coast and I definitely want to check out some New York

01:29:40.780 --> 01:29:41.780
stuff.

01:29:41.780 --> 01:29:46.280
You guys have to throw a big tournament for me around Labor Day, okay?

01:29:46.280 --> 01:29:50.280
I think we will. I think me, Ron, and the other New Yorker people will do it.

01:29:50.280 --> 01:29:54.780
Sounds good to me. I am definitely looking into the possibilities of doing something like that around Labor Day-ish.

01:29:54.780 --> 01:29:57.780
So, I want to see what New York's got to offer.

01:29:57.780 --> 01:29:59.280
We got a lot.

01:29:59.280 --> 01:30:05.780
Alright, sounds good. How about your friend who's there? Pass the mic or something. Hello?

01:30:05.780 --> 01:30:06.780
Yeah, hold on.

01:30:06.780 --> 01:30:09.780
Okay. Yes, sir!

01:30:09.780 --> 01:30:10.780
Hello?

01:30:10.780 --> 01:30:14.780
Hi, and this is Sephiroth, or, no, this is, this is Sephiroth?

01:30:14.780 --> 01:30:15.780
Yeah, yeah.

01:30:15.780 --> 01:30:17.780
Hey, how ya doin'?

01:30:17.780 --> 01:30:18.780
I'm good.

01:30:18.780 --> 01:30:20.780
Your thoughts on the lawsuit?

01:30:20.780 --> 01:30:29.100
Um, yeah, you know, I think, they really just screwed up on how they put the, uh, the game

01:30:29.100 --> 01:30:33.060
on the DDR machines and wrote it, but otherwise I think everything else should have been fine.

01:30:33.060 --> 01:30:34.060
Yeah, it's-

01:30:34.060 --> 01:30:37.300
That should be, like, the main thing that Konami should have just sued for.

01:30:37.300 --> 01:30:40.860
It's almost like they learned their lesson within the Groove too, but it's like, too

01:30:40.860 --> 01:30:41.860
late!

01:30:41.860 --> 01:30:42.860
Whoops!

01:30:42.860 --> 01:30:43.860
So.

01:30:43.860 --> 01:30:44.860
Yeah.

01:30:44.860 --> 01:30:45.860
Yeah.

01:30:45.860 --> 01:30:46.860
You got a good point there.

01:30:46.860 --> 01:30:47.860
Anything else you want to share with us?

01:30:47.860 --> 01:30:48.860
That sucks.

01:30:48.860 --> 01:30:49.860
No, not really.

01:30:49.860 --> 01:30:50.860
Okay.

01:30:50.860 --> 01:30:51.860
Alright, well.

01:30:51.860 --> 01:30:56.940
Except for, yeah, I'm pretty pissed that, you know, I pre-ordered that in the Groove

01:30:56.940 --> 01:30:59.300
with the afterburner pad bundle.

01:30:59.300 --> 01:31:01.940
You won't be disappointed with the afterburner pad, I'll tell you that.

01:31:01.940 --> 01:31:05.900
I have good things to say about the afterburner pad, it's marvelous.

01:31:05.900 --> 01:31:07.420
But yeah, unfortunately.

01:31:07.420 --> 01:31:08.420
You know what though?

01:31:08.420 --> 01:31:12.220
Red Octane, from what I've seen, they're a decent company and they'll do something for

01:31:12.220 --> 01:31:15.740
you when they give you your money back if it comes to that.

01:31:15.740 --> 01:31:17.200
Hopefully it won't.

01:31:17.200 --> 01:31:20.420
Something will be able to happen or In the Groove can still come out in some capacity,

01:31:20.420 --> 01:31:22.820
but time will tell.

01:31:22.820 --> 01:31:26.300
I think we'll find out shortly after E3 what's going to happen.

01:31:26.300 --> 01:31:30.140
Or I don't know, we could find out next week because what a good time to release that kind

01:31:30.140 --> 01:31:34.460
of news during E3 when there's so much other stuff to divert people's attention.

01:31:34.460 --> 01:31:40.360
It'll kind of be a good time, you know, everybody's looking over here. Oh, by the way, we settled so we'll see

01:31:42.320 --> 01:31:46.500
Yeah, hopefully, all right, well I'm gonna let you go so we get some new more calls

01:31:46.500 --> 01:31:48.500
But thank you guys both for calling in. All right

01:31:48.940 --> 01:31:53.540
Okay, and I like this idea by the way of the orange lounge radio listening parties

01:31:54.260 --> 01:31:56.260
So you guys keep it up?

01:31:56.820 --> 01:31:58.820
All right. All right later

01:31:58.820 --> 01:32:03.780
I don't think he knew what to think of that comment.

01:32:03.780 --> 01:32:07.540
Let's go to this call. Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio.

01:32:07.540 --> 01:32:12.820
Hey, what's up? It's Ronma from New York. Hello, Ronma from New York.

01:32:12.820 --> 01:32:17.180
We just got off the phone with some folks from New York. Did you hear what I said to the other guys from New York?

01:32:17.180 --> 01:32:21.540
Yes, I did, and when you come to New York, I'm going to show you around.

01:32:21.540 --> 01:32:25.940
Alright, I'm actually, actually, I have a really good friend, one of my best friends in the whole wide world lives in

01:32:25.940 --> 01:32:26.780
Connecticut,

01:32:26.780 --> 01:32:30.180
but that's just a hop, skip, and a jump away from NYC, so we're looking into it.

01:32:30.180 --> 01:32:33.340
Sweet, sweet. So what's on your mind?

01:32:33.340 --> 01:32:36.940
Not much. One thing about this whole lawsuit thing,

01:32:36.940 --> 01:32:40.740
I think Rockstar had a pretty good idea what was going to happen when they did this.

01:32:40.740 --> 01:32:43.820
Hey, put it in a DDR machine. Save money. Look where that got you.

01:32:43.820 --> 01:32:49.060
Yeah, maybe you got a good point. Rockstar being the startup it was,

01:32:49.060 --> 01:32:52.660
just kind of did this as a cost-saving thing, not really thinking about the

01:32:52.660 --> 01:32:54.180
ramifications of what it could have.

01:32:54.180 --> 01:32:57.220
Interesting perspective. Basically. Interesting.

01:32:57.220 --> 01:33:00.860
What are your personal thoughts on the lawsuit? What do you think will happen

01:33:00.860 --> 01:33:01.540
because of this?

01:33:01.540 --> 01:33:06.060
I think it's going to settle out even though one of the people that was at Anime

01:33:06.060 --> 01:33:08.220
Boston that did drop 40 bucks on it.

01:33:08.220 --> 01:33:12.260
I'll wait. I'll personally wait because I know as soon as I say I want my money back

01:33:12.260 --> 01:33:16.380
the game comes out and I won't have the money for it.

01:33:16.380 --> 01:33:19.660
So you actually pre-ordered it at this Anime Expo?

01:33:19.660 --> 01:33:21.660
Yeah, Anime Boston.

01:33:21.660 --> 01:33:25.660
Anime Boston. And that must have been last weekend before this whole news came out, right?

01:33:25.660 --> 01:33:27.660
Oh, that's right, because you gave us your wrap-up last week.

01:33:27.660 --> 01:33:28.660
Yeah.

01:33:28.660 --> 01:33:29.660
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay.

01:33:29.660 --> 01:33:30.660
Mm-hmm.

01:33:30.660 --> 01:33:32.660
Oh, man, that's crappy timing. I'm sorry to hear that happen to you.

01:33:32.660 --> 01:33:34.660
It's okay. It's okay.

01:33:34.660 --> 01:33:37.660
All right. One other thing before we go to another call.

01:33:37.660 --> 01:33:41.660
Thing you are most looking forward to hearing about from E3?

01:33:41.660 --> 01:33:47.660
Nintendo Revolution. And before I go, I'm posting a link from my website,

01:33:47.660 --> 01:33:50.300
the whole Nintendo World Extravaganza Saturday.

01:33:50.300 --> 01:33:53.660
Oh, the opening of the store.

01:33:53.660 --> 01:33:58.060
I want to hear about that. Yeah, tell us more about that. How was the opening of the store?

01:33:58.060 --> 01:34:01.820
Okay, I got to about nine thirty-ish. It was kind of quiet.

01:34:01.820 --> 01:34:05.220
When they picked up some friends, we got back around eleven-ish.

01:34:05.220 --> 01:34:09.820
It was jam-packed. Almost every other person was walking around with a DS,

01:34:09.820 --> 01:34:14.220
nothing but chats. I'm walking up and down the lines taking pictures,

01:34:14.220 --> 01:34:16.700
and there were two people with PSPs that were getting booed.

01:34:16.700 --> 01:34:19.980
Hahahaha, two people with PSPs.

01:34:19.980 --> 01:34:23.700
I'd be like point, point, point. That's funny.

01:34:23.700 --> 01:34:26.860
How crazy were the DS Picto chat rooms?

01:34:26.860 --> 01:34:30.300
That's what I want to know. How many penises were drawn on Picto chat rooms?

01:34:30.300 --> 01:34:34.020
It was so pervert to the point where Loki would just smile.

01:34:34.020 --> 01:34:37.660
Hahahaha. There's like a Naruto one on here.

01:34:37.660 --> 01:34:42.580
That's cool. Yes there is. And you'll see a picture of the

01:34:42.580 --> 01:34:46.700
the Game Boy from from the Gulf War. Oh,

01:34:46.700 --> 01:34:49.860
wow, interesting. Okay, well, um,

01:34:49.860 --> 01:34:52.860
wow, definitely check out that site and look at the pictures there. Um,

01:34:52.860 --> 01:34:56.180
one other thing I want to, did they have DS downloadable anything

01:34:56.180 --> 01:34:59.900
there? No. Aw, bummer, I was kinda hoping they would.

01:34:59.900 --> 01:35:04.900
Give us a sign of what's gonna come up from E3. I don't know, but one funny thing was they

01:35:04.900 --> 01:35:05.740
were handing out

01:35:05.740 --> 01:35:09.540
free DS stylus as you walked in, and they also had

01:35:09.540 --> 01:35:12.940
Little bottles of Nintendo World Water for you to drink.

01:35:12.940 --> 01:35:15.540
Nintendo World Water. That's awesome.

01:35:15.540 --> 01:35:16.540
Yes.

01:35:17.540 --> 01:35:20.540
Refreshing. I hope they have Nintendo Water next week. We'll see.

01:35:20.540 --> 01:35:22.540
Ooh, a Famicom.

01:35:22.540 --> 01:35:25.040
Well, thank you for sharing that with us. It sounds exciting. I wish we could have been there.

01:35:25.040 --> 01:35:28.540
You know what? That is a place I'm going to have to visit when I go to New York.

01:35:28.540 --> 01:35:29.540
The Nintendo World Center.

01:35:29.540 --> 01:35:30.040
Sweet.

01:35:30.040 --> 01:35:31.540
And I'm buying myself a Pikachu.

01:35:32.540 --> 01:35:34.040
Yeah, Pikachu BO!

01:35:34.540 --> 01:35:35.040
Cheers!

01:35:35.040 --> 01:35:37.540
Well, thank you very much for calling in, Rama. I hope you have a good week, okay?

01:35:37.540 --> 01:35:41.300
You two see you on PSO? Alright, see ya. Bye.

01:35:41.300 --> 01:35:45.540
Pikachu Beetle! Look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look!

01:35:45.540 --> 01:35:48.860
Is that from his picture? It's the Pikachu Beetle!

01:35:48.860 --> 01:35:52.340
Alright, we're going to do another call because there's another person who's been trying to get in and

01:35:52.340 --> 01:35:56.540
call, so we're going to take this call. Hello, you're on Orange is the House Radio.

01:35:56.540 --> 01:36:00.180
Hi, who's this? This is Jaded. Jaded!

01:36:00.180 --> 01:36:03.820
What's on your mind? Oh, nothing much.

01:36:03.820 --> 01:36:06.240
What do you think about this whole lawsuit going on right

01:36:06.240 --> 01:36:07.700
now, Konami versus Rockstar?

01:36:07.700 --> 01:36:10.900
I just think right now it's too early to make any kind of

01:36:10.900 --> 01:36:11.980
intelligent decision.

01:36:11.980 --> 01:36:12.860
You know what?

01:36:12.860 --> 01:36:14.240
You bring up a damn good point.

01:36:14.240 --> 01:36:16.620
And even from somebody who's been sitting here and yapping

01:36:16.620 --> 01:36:20.700
about it for about the past hour, it really is too early

01:36:20.700 --> 01:36:22.620
to make an informed decision about everything.

01:36:22.620 --> 01:36:24.180
Although, I got to hand it off.

01:36:24.180 --> 01:36:27.300
Because of the DDR Freak releasing the actual

01:36:27.300 --> 01:36:30.260
documents, that helped immensely in trying to figure

01:36:30.260 --> 01:36:32.780
out where's Konami coming from on this whole thing.

01:36:32.780 --> 01:36:35.600
And I think it actually took some of the evilness,

01:36:35.600 --> 01:36:39.740
the big bad Konami-ness, I think it took some of that out

01:36:39.740 --> 01:36:41.780
because people looked at it and went, well,

01:36:41.780 --> 01:36:44.380
they kind of do have a point.

01:36:44.380 --> 01:36:45.820
They kind of do have a point.

01:36:45.820 --> 01:36:49.180
Right now, it's just too early.

01:36:49.180 --> 01:36:51.820
Everybody is saying that it's going

01:36:51.820 --> 01:36:55.060
to go several different ways.

01:36:55.060 --> 01:36:58.340
And right now, I'm just personally not

01:36:58.340 --> 01:36:59.780
believing anything.

01:36:59.780 --> 01:37:01.940
I'm just personally thinking that it's too early.

01:37:01.940 --> 01:37:08.180
have your hands over your ears going I can't hear you I can't hear you have you

01:37:08.180 --> 01:37:12.160
have you pre-ordered in the groove no I have I was curious if you were one of

01:37:12.160 --> 01:37:15.060
those customers because I know if I was one of those people that have pre-ordered

01:37:15.060 --> 01:37:18.640
in the groove I'd probably be a lot like that right now I did not just waste $40

01:37:18.640 --> 01:37:23.640
la la la la la yeah so be interesting although I wouldn't panic if you guys

01:37:23.640 --> 01:37:27.440
ordered in the groove pre-ordered and it doesn't come out for whatever reason

01:37:27.440 --> 01:37:30.920
although I I seriously think it will it'll just be delayed but if the game

01:37:30.920 --> 01:37:34.520
and more to come out. I'm sure Red Octane will be very good about refunding everybody's

01:37:34.520 --> 01:37:40.160
money or, you know, doing nice things. And maybe you'll even get a free tattoo. So, those

01:37:40.160 --> 01:37:45.520
temporary tattoos. I should have worn my Red Octane shirt tonight. It's been a nice night

01:37:45.520 --> 01:37:48.000
for me to wear it, although you can't see crap on the webcam, because it's a dark day.

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:53.840
But anyway, um, it reminds me I should turn on a light in here. Our webcam, orangeonsradio.com.

01:37:53.840 --> 01:37:57.960
Thing you're most looking forward to hearing about from E3 next week?

01:37:57.960 --> 01:38:01.960
I'm just looking forward to the Final Fantasy Advent Children news.

01:38:01.960 --> 01:38:09.960
Ah, me too. You remember last year they really hyped this up that they were going to be showing the big movies at E3

01:38:09.960 --> 01:38:13.960
and that's when we got our first glimpse at Kingdom Hearts 2 and the Advent Children.

01:38:13.960 --> 01:38:20.960
I haven't really heard a whole lot about that this year. I'm kind of hoping Squeenix kind of does that where they have like the movie show again.

01:38:20.960 --> 01:38:24.960
You remember that Dark Sakura where you had to get the ticket and go into the show and see the movies?

01:38:24.960 --> 01:38:26.960
This time I'm going to actually go through the whole thing.

01:38:26.960 --> 01:38:31.200
Yeah, I'm hoping they do that again this year. I wish they'd just screen the whole

01:38:31.200 --> 01:38:32.640
damn movie so we could see it,

01:38:32.640 --> 01:38:36.000
but I know that won't happen, because they know that a lot of the fanboys are gonna be there.

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.840
So, I'm looking forward to this too.

01:38:38.840 --> 01:38:42.600
The reason why I'm interested in this is that

01:38:42.600 --> 01:38:47.240
it's been delayed multiple times and, frankly, I'm waiting for something to

01:38:47.240 --> 01:38:47.760
happen.

01:38:47.760 --> 01:38:51.840
Very true. Well, I know that we had posted a story earlier that you, being a

01:38:51.840 --> 01:38:54.960
big fan of Advent Children, probably have already heard this, but for those that

01:38:54.960 --> 01:38:56.360
didn't hear about this yet,

01:38:56.360 --> 01:39:01.280
Actually, they did announce that there was going to be a date for this, and it's going

01:39:01.280 --> 01:39:04.600
to be simultaneous, if I remember right, between the U.S. and Japan.

01:39:04.600 --> 01:39:08.060
So those of you that sometimes feel shafted that Squeenix always gives Japan the good

01:39:08.060 --> 01:39:18.140
stuff months, even a year before we get it, let's see, the date is September 14, 2005.

01:39:18.140 --> 01:39:20.420
Simultaneous release in America and Japan.

01:39:20.420 --> 01:39:22.540
UMD release, not a part of that.

01:39:22.540 --> 01:39:24.540
This is only the DVD.

01:39:24.540 --> 01:39:25.540
But that should be cool.

01:39:25.540 --> 01:39:29.420
So, alright, well thanks for calling and

01:39:29.420 --> 01:39:33.220
you know what, thanks for bringing up a point that, you know, we really don't know

01:39:33.220 --> 01:39:35.980
what the hell we're talking about in some aspects with this.

01:39:35.980 --> 01:39:39.740
So we'll see what happens. Alright. Have a good one.

01:39:39.740 --> 01:39:43.180
It was nice talking to you. Nice talking to you. Thanks for calling. Later.

01:39:43.180 --> 01:39:48.780
Bye. That was nice. A nice young man there calling in.

01:39:48.780 --> 01:39:52.380
That was good. Alright. An intelligence perspective. We like that.

01:39:52.380 --> 01:39:56.580
We are very lucky that we have a lot of very intelligent listeners that listen to this show, aren't we?

01:39:56.580 --> 01:39:58.080
I would say so.

01:39:58.080 --> 01:39:58.680
Alright.

01:39:58.680 --> 01:39:59.780
And the pharaoh agrees.

01:40:01.580 --> 01:40:05.180
Um, what we're gonna do now is actually, I think we'll go into the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match

01:40:05.180 --> 01:40:08.280
because you know it's already almost like 8.30 and we haven't even gotten to the Cage Match yet.

01:40:08.280 --> 01:40:09.980
Did Loki send us something?

01:40:09.980 --> 01:40:10.980
Actually, he did.

01:40:10.980 --> 01:40:11.480
Okay.

01:40:11.480 --> 01:40:16.580
So, we were lucky in that. So, we do have a full-blown regular Cage Match for you guys tonight.

01:40:16.580 --> 01:40:21.080
So, without further ado, let's get into the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match.

01:40:21.080 --> 01:40:29.080
For those of you guys still trying to get in on the Skype line, no worries, we will take more calls a little later in the show, so just be patient. Sorry you didn't get through yet.

01:40:30.080 --> 01:40:38.080
Alright. Remember, the way the cage match works, you have to be in our chat room. www.orangeloungeradio.com. Click on chat.

01:40:38.080 --> 01:40:41.060
The way this works we play three songs for you guys

01:40:41.180 --> 01:40:49.220
You pick your favorite and the winning song goes into rotation all week long on orange lounge radios gaming music and more program

01:40:49.220 --> 01:40:53.700
Which plays 24 hours a day seven days a week on this station when we aren't live

01:40:53.940 --> 01:40:57.060
All right, let's get into it last week in the cage match

01:40:57.980 --> 01:41:03.660
Jamie had put a song in and you know that right now Jamie is all about the gorillas

01:41:03.660 --> 01:41:12.660
So she kinda took that, she didn't put a Gorillaz song in here, but she did something that you could say was perhaps inspired a little bit by the Gorillaz fandom.

01:41:12.660 --> 01:41:13.660
I don't know.

01:41:13.660 --> 01:41:14.660
A little bit.

01:41:14.660 --> 01:41:16.660
Well, I can't help it that Damon's awesome.

01:41:16.660 --> 01:41:21.660
Yeah, but I liked Damon Auburn before Blur, really. I mean before Gorillaz because of Blur, so.

01:41:21.660 --> 01:41:30.660
But this was interesting because last week a little bit of controversy because the song is very quirky and a lot of people either loved it or they hated it.

01:41:30.660 --> 01:41:34.600
But what happened last week is that it was up against two trance songs, which ended up

01:41:34.600 --> 01:41:37.280
kind of splitting the vote a little bit, causing this one to win.

01:41:37.280 --> 01:41:39.000
I think it will be a fair thing to say.

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.560
So we shall see if it hangs on again tonight.

01:41:41.560 --> 01:41:42.560
Here it is.

01:41:42.560 --> 01:41:43.560
Song number one.

01:41:43.560 --> 01:41:45.100
Only a clip because it won last week.

01:41:45.100 --> 01:41:47.980
Damon Allbrin with a rappy song.

01:41:47.980 --> 01:41:51.080
How appropriate considering the PSO blue burst I've been doing this week.

01:41:51.080 --> 01:41:52.080
All rappy.

01:41:52.080 --> 01:41:53.080
All right.

01:41:53.080 --> 01:41:54.380
Damon Allbrin, a rappy song.

01:41:54.380 --> 01:41:55.380
The remix.

01:41:55.380 --> 01:41:56.380
Enjoy.

01:41:56.380 --> 01:42:01.380
It is a rapping song, but I've got something ticking

01:42:01.380 --> 01:42:06.380
It won't be there, I'm overwhelmed, I choose to stay

01:42:06.380 --> 01:42:11.380
I come back in my bag, I'm drinking all the sunshine today

01:42:11.380 --> 01:42:15.380
I'm drinking my faith, and all my words

01:42:15.380 --> 01:42:18.380
Just shut up with no face

01:42:18.380 --> 01:42:21.380
I'll waste a few, I'll give you a dance

01:42:21.380 --> 01:42:24.380
I'm falling

01:42:41.380 --> 01:42:42.380
I

01:42:42.380 --> 01:42:43.380
I

01:42:43.380 --> 01:42:44.380
I

01:42:44.380 --> 01:42:45.380
I

01:42:45.380 --> 01:42:46.380
I

01:42:46.380 --> 01:42:47.380
I

01:42:47.380 --> 01:42:48.380
I

01:42:48.380 --> 01:42:49.380
I

01:42:49.380 --> 01:42:53.180
I'ma take a moment to put myself in the feeling that your body can't survive

01:42:53.180 --> 01:42:55.780
Becoming a slave to the rhythm, there's no way that you can stop me

01:42:55.780 --> 01:42:57.980
Now I'd like to see you thrive

01:42:57.980 --> 01:43:00.580
Cause I'm already long, so don't be scared for me, baby

01:43:00.580 --> 01:43:02.780
Let's blow your tears to the ground

01:43:02.780 --> 01:43:04.380
I can't believe you have to stay behind me

01:43:04.380 --> 01:43:06.180
Throw me your eyes off of me, baby

01:43:06.180 --> 01:43:07.580
Tell me why

01:43:07.580 --> 01:43:09.780
So now your team won't let you free, don't follow me

01:43:09.780 --> 01:43:12.380
Don't grab me, you'll seem to die

01:43:12.380 --> 01:43:14.780
But best believe I'ma breathe and break ground

01:43:14.780 --> 01:43:17.180
Before I die

01:43:17.180 --> 01:43:20.180
And I will never get real for my love, oh that's my life

01:43:21.180 --> 01:43:24.180
I go from hotel to the club, come to the club

01:43:24.180 --> 01:43:28.180
And to my room and hopefully, I look to chat and

01:43:29.180 --> 01:43:32.180
She looks friendly through my camera lens

01:43:32.180 --> 01:43:37.180
And that's the reason I wasn't in my story when we were young again

01:43:39.180 --> 01:43:40.180
I look like I

01:43:40.180 --> 01:43:42.180
I like the white skin and the white hair

01:43:42.180 --> 01:43:44.180
I like the glasses, the zips, the way they style their hair

01:43:44.180 --> 01:43:47.180
I like that crimp look, what they do with their fangs

01:43:47.180 --> 01:43:49.180
I like them pricks, but I still like the fangs

01:43:49.180 --> 01:43:52.180
So stop, chase those guys, I'm putting it up

01:43:52.180 --> 01:43:55.180
Put aside a motherfucking prize, it's gonna get engraving

01:43:55.180 --> 01:43:59.180
Think you're on a limit, can't stay awake, even if you're kidding.

01:44:25.180 --> 01:44:54.860
Alright, you

01:44:54.860 --> 01:44:58.040
You got a long clip there actually you guys you guys lucked out with a long clip there

01:44:58.040 --> 01:45:02.880
because I screwed up and I've misplaced Loki's cage match song for tonight so I gotta find

01:45:02.880 --> 01:45:03.880
it.

01:45:03.880 --> 01:45:04.880
Correct me if I'm wrong.

01:45:04.880 --> 01:45:05.880
Yes.

01:45:05.880 --> 01:45:06.880
You've misplaced Loki's song.

01:45:06.880 --> 01:45:07.880
Oh shut up.

01:45:07.880 --> 01:45:08.880
Alright so there it was.

01:45:08.880 --> 01:45:09.880
Song number one.

01:45:09.880 --> 01:45:11.080
Damon Auburn with a rappy song.

01:45:11.080 --> 01:45:12.080
The remix.

01:45:12.080 --> 01:45:13.880
Okay here we go into song number two tonight.

01:45:13.880 --> 01:45:15.200
It's my pick.

01:45:15.200 --> 01:45:19.860
And this comes off that same dance compilation that I've been putting songs from in lately

01:45:19.860 --> 01:45:21.360
and Jamie's already rolling her eyes.

01:45:21.360 --> 01:45:23.080
But here's the weird thing.

01:45:23.080 --> 01:45:27.280
I believe this is actually Ayumi Hamasaki, who showed up on this compilation.

01:45:27.280 --> 01:45:29.240
If it sounds like she's holding her nose, then it is.

01:45:29.240 --> 01:45:30.620
I think it is.

01:45:30.620 --> 01:45:33.720
But she's simply being credited as IU.

01:45:33.720 --> 01:45:36.880
And if it's not her, then it sure sounds like her.

01:45:36.880 --> 01:45:39.740
So I'm picking this song because I like it.

01:45:39.740 --> 01:45:41.820
The song is called Appears.

01:45:41.820 --> 01:45:42.820
So here it is.

01:45:42.820 --> 01:45:43.820
IU with Appears.

01:45:43.820 --> 01:45:46.560
And I'm going to refer to it as IU because that's the way it's credited on the CD.

01:45:46.560 --> 01:45:48.560
So enjoy!

01:49:46.560 --> 01:49:48.560
We have to rate them.

01:49:48.560 --> 01:49:51.560
Oh yeah, I was just going to move. Move on.

01:49:51.560 --> 01:49:53.560
Dear Rob, rate.

01:49:53.560 --> 01:49:55.560
Dark Sakura, what did you think of that?

01:49:55.560 --> 01:50:00.560
Ayumi's voice annoys me. Sorry, because she's so nasally.

01:50:00.560 --> 01:50:05.560
And I really like a bunch of her stuff, and I really liked her for a while.

01:50:05.560 --> 01:50:12.560
But I can't get too excited about Ayumi Hamasaki just because she's been there been that, you know.

01:50:12.560 --> 01:50:16.560
Um, it's still solid. It's still trance. Um, 8 gives a 7.

01:50:17.560 --> 01:50:26.560
Um, I feel a little bit similar where I'm like, well, it's another Yumi song, but God, I love her trance stuff. I just love those mixes. They make me happy. I give it a 9.

01:50:27.560 --> 01:50:36.560
Alright, song number 3 is Loki's Pick, and he specifically told me he's putting this in because he couldn't think of anything better, and this is what he figured out at the last minute.

01:50:36.560 --> 01:50:38.560
I know exactly what this is.

01:50:38.560 --> 01:50:40.560
So this is...

01:50:40.560 --> 01:50:42.560
Darth Punk is the name of this.

01:50:42.560 --> 01:50:45.560
It says, Ted Koppel's Gin and Juice.

01:50:46.560 --> 01:50:49.560
I have no idea what to expect.

01:50:49.560 --> 01:50:56.560
Here it is, song number three, LOKI's, Jin and Juu's, Ted Goble.

01:50:56.560 --> 01:51:22.320
With so much drama in the ABC, it's kinda hard being Ted K.O.P., but I, somehow, someway,

01:51:22.320 --> 01:51:26.120
keep coming up with funky ass shit like every single day.

01:51:26.120 --> 01:51:32.040
May I kick a little something for the G's and make a few ends as I breeze through.

01:51:32.040 --> 01:51:35.880
Two in the morning and the party's still jumping cause my mama ain't home.

01:51:35.880 --> 01:51:40.680
I got bitches in the living room getting it on and they ain't leaving till six in the

01:51:40.680 --> 01:51:42.080
morning.

01:51:42.080 --> 01:51:43.080
So what you wanna do?

01:51:43.080 --> 01:51:47.200
Shit, I've got a pocket full of rubbers and my homeboys do too.

01:51:47.200 --> 01:51:49.640
So turn off the lights and close the doors.

01:51:49.640 --> 01:51:50.640
But...

01:51:50.640 --> 01:51:56.320
Yeah, so we gon' smoke an ounce to this G's up, hoes down, while you motherfuckers

01:51:56.320 --> 01:51:57.320
bounce to bits

01:51:57.320 --> 01:52:00.320
Rollin' down the street, gettin' up, gettin' in

01:52:00.320 --> 01:52:03.800
I'm Ted Drapo, and this is Laid Back

01:52:03.800 --> 01:52:07.120
With my mind on my money and my money on my mind

01:52:07.120 --> 01:52:09.800
Rollin' down the street, gettin' up, gettin' in

01:52:09.800 --> 01:52:14.160
The watches close to the White House today confirmed that the President is Laid Back

01:52:14.160 --> 01:52:16.760
With my mind on my money and my money on my money

01:52:16.760 --> 01:52:21.160
Now that I got me some Seagram's gin Everybody got they cups but they ain't chipped

01:52:24.160 --> 01:52:26.960
You gotta get yours but fool I gotta get mine

01:52:26.960 --> 01:52:29.840
Everything is fine when you're listening to the T.E.D.

01:52:29.840 --> 01:52:33.840
I got the cultivating music that be captivating he who listens

01:52:33.840 --> 01:52:38.360
To the words that I speak as I take me a drink To the middle of the street and get to mackin'

01:52:38.360 --> 01:52:42.240
this bitch named Katie She used to be the homeboys lady

01:52:42.240 --> 01:52:47.600
80 degrees, when I tell that bitch, please raise up off these NUTs, cause you get none

01:52:47.600 --> 01:52:50.120
of these at ease.

01:52:50.120 --> 01:52:56.240
As I mob with the dog pound field that breathes biatch, I'm just...

01:52:56.240 --> 01:53:06.120
Earthquakes rock Tokyo, Japan today as residents were laid back.

01:53:06.120 --> 01:53:10.880
Residents in a small New England town are terrified as a mass murderer is laid back.

01:53:10.880 --> 01:53:19.660
Later on that day, my homie Sam Donaldson came through with a gang of Tanqueray

01:53:19.660 --> 01:53:22.940
And a fat-ass J of some boob on a chronic that made me choke

01:53:22.940 --> 01:53:26.980
Shit, this ain't no joke, I had to back up off of it and sit my cup down

01:53:26.980 --> 01:53:29.340
Tanqueray and Chronic, yeah, I'm fucked up now

01:53:29.340 --> 01:53:34.420
But it ain't no stoppin', I'm still poppin' Sam got some bitches from the city of Compton

01:53:34.420 --> 01:53:37.860
to serve me Not with a cherry on top, cause when I bust

01:53:37.860 --> 01:53:40.180
my nut I'm raisin' up off the cot

01:53:40.180 --> 01:53:46.180
But don't get upset, girl, that's just how it goes. I don't love you hoes, I'm out the door and I'll be.

01:53:46.180 --> 01:53:52.180
Residents of Baghdad fired shots wildly into the air as protesters were laid back.

01:53:52.180 --> 01:53:55.180
With my mind on the money and the money on the buy.

01:53:55.180 --> 01:53:59.180
They're rolling down the street, don't hear me at all.

01:53:59.180 --> 01:54:02.180
I'm Ted Koppel and this is Laid Back.

01:54:02.180 --> 01:54:05.180
With my mind on the money and the money on the buy.

01:54:05.180 --> 01:54:08.180
They're rolling down the street, don't hear me at all.

01:54:08.180 --> 01:54:12.180
Okay, now here's a question. What do you say, B-H?

01:54:12.180 --> 01:54:13.180
B-H?

01:54:13.180 --> 01:54:15.180
With my mind on the money and the money...

01:54:15.180 --> 01:54:20.180
Right, see, exactly. I just don't... I don't understand. I don't... I don't know what that word is.

01:54:20.180 --> 01:54:22.180
Is that... is that how it's pronounced?

01:54:22.180 --> 01:54:23.180
B-H?

01:54:23.180 --> 01:54:27.180
Right, yeah. I just... I... I just... I don't understand.

01:54:27.180 --> 01:54:51.540
The first time I heard that I thought it was intensely retarded.

01:54:51.540 --> 01:54:55.760
He wanted me to put it as a fortune cookie and I refused to.

01:54:55.760 --> 01:54:59.760
So it gets a big whoppin'.5.

01:54:59.760 --> 01:55:03.760
Just because I like how he does the blah blah blah blah and lays back.

01:55:03.760 --> 01:55:07.760
You know, Loki played that for me too, saying it was like the funniest thing he'd ever heard, and I was like,

01:55:07.760 --> 01:55:11.760
this is not the funniest thing I've ever heard.

01:55:11.760 --> 01:55:15.760
Jokes that Diane Mita-Zoda makes on G4 can be funnier

01:55:15.760 --> 01:55:19.760
than this, I'm sorry. If you're gonna be funny and do a parody

01:55:19.760 --> 01:55:23.760
song, be funny. I give that

01:55:23.760 --> 01:55:35.320
The three songs you get to vote for tonight.

01:55:35.320 --> 01:55:39.440
Song number one, Damon Albron, a rappy song.

01:55:39.440 --> 01:55:47.240
The remix.

01:55:47.240 --> 01:55:54.240
Song number two you can vote for tonight is I.U. with Appears.

01:55:59.200 --> 01:56:02.480
And song number three you can vote for tonight, Darth Punk,

01:56:02.480 --> 01:56:07.440
Ted Koppel's Gin and Juice.

01:56:07.440 --> 01:56:12.760
George's close to the White House today confirmed that the President is laid back.

01:56:12.760 --> 01:56:14.760
I got a laid back in there for you, Jamie.

01:56:14.760 --> 01:56:17.760
I liked that one. That's not all I like about the song.

01:56:17.760 --> 01:56:22.760
Place vote now. Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.

01:56:22.760 --> 01:56:25.760
Hurry, hurry. We'll add him up and let you know who the winner is.

01:56:25.760 --> 01:56:28.760
Um, you know what? He sounds like one of...

01:56:28.760 --> 01:56:33.760
You remember the two Muppets that sat up in the balcony and made fun of all the other Muppets on the Muppet show?

01:56:33.760 --> 01:56:34.760
That's what he sounds like in that.

01:56:34.760 --> 01:56:36.760
Yeah, it's...

01:56:36.760 --> 01:56:39.760
Laid back? Ah ha ha ha!

01:56:39.760 --> 01:56:41.760
Yeah.

01:56:41.760 --> 01:56:45.880
Don't vote for Hollick.

01:56:45.880 --> 01:56:50.020
Votes for Hollick are thrown out, okay? There's always a movement in the

01:56:50.020 --> 01:56:51.200
chat room to vote for Hollick.

01:56:51.200 --> 01:56:57.240
Remember, the winning song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:56:57.240 --> 01:57:01.480
Hollick is in permanent rotation already on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:57:01.480 --> 01:57:04.480
You don't need to vote it into rotation. It does no good.

01:57:04.480 --> 01:57:07.840
Okay, just wanted to make that clear.

01:57:07.840 --> 01:57:11.720
I realize some of you like to vote for Holik when you feel that the rest of our

01:57:11.720 --> 01:57:12.360
songs were

01:57:12.360 --> 01:57:16.580
crappy or something like that, but just deal.

01:57:16.580 --> 01:57:22.000
Anyway, this is the part of the show where Loki would typically give us the

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:25.160
Sim Scene update and tell us what's going on in the Sim Scene.

01:57:25.160 --> 01:57:28.720
However, I have no idea what's going on in the Sim Scene right now.

01:57:28.720 --> 01:57:33.480
So... Uh, a bunch of stuff happened, but not really, because it's Sims.

01:57:33.480 --> 01:57:40.480
I'll bet you what, probably this lawsuit has people freaked out about making any sims right now.

01:57:40.480 --> 01:57:47.480
I bet, a bunch of crappy Max remixes were released on Maimani style, what can I say?

01:57:47.480 --> 01:57:52.480
No, no, no. ParanoiaMax.5007

01:57:52.480 --> 01:57:56.480
Let's talk about the real thing, shall we? The real deal, the real thing.

01:57:56.480 --> 01:57:58.480
Yeah, in the groove!

01:57:58.480 --> 01:57:59.480
No, no, no. Even better than that.

01:57:59.480 --> 01:58:06.080
Konami has launched something on their website and what it is it is a teaser

01:58:06.080 --> 01:58:12.520
pic for a brand new DDR and you can see it on our website at www.orangeloungeradio.com

01:58:12.520 --> 01:58:18.760
In this video it appears to have, I'm sorry it's not a video, sorry

01:58:18.760 --> 01:58:23.200
a picture it appears to have maybe some captures from new videos or something

01:58:23.200 --> 01:58:28.720
but it does indicate that a new DDR is coming out however in the corner it says

01:58:28.720 --> 01:58:32.140
coming out on PlayStation 2. So I think people got excited at first that this is a

01:58:32.140 --> 01:58:37.780
new arcade mix. It doesn't look like it. This is probably Japan's version of

01:58:37.780 --> 01:58:43.100
whatever we're getting with Xtreme 2, such as Festival was like our DDR Xtreme.

01:58:43.100 --> 01:58:49.720
This is probably their version of what we're gonna get as Xtreme 2. And of

01:58:49.720 --> 01:58:54.900
course we talked about Xtreme 2 a little bit last week. IToy stuff coming back.

01:58:54.900 --> 01:58:58.420
it's gonna have the oops I did it again

01:58:58.420 --> 01:59:02.340
rumored online play and all that fun stuff. We'll know more of course next week

01:59:02.340 --> 01:59:07.140
it doesn't seem like any big surprise that

01:59:07.140 --> 01:59:10.820
this would be ported to Japan as well and be coming out there

01:59:10.820 --> 01:59:14.060
or maybe we're getting the port it's hard to say but

01:59:14.060 --> 01:59:18.020
no surprise really. Things you would like to see in the next PlayStation release

01:59:18.020 --> 01:59:19.140
of DDR? Jamie anything?

01:59:19.140 --> 01:59:23.780
I can't really say you know because the one thing I wanted

01:59:23.780 --> 01:59:27.860
was freaking Dance Magic. I just want Dance Magic mode to come back.

01:59:27.860 --> 01:59:32.540
Yeah, you know what, and you almost kind of said, is that In the Groove has a mode like that,

01:59:32.540 --> 01:59:36.220
although not as many people play it as you'd think,

01:59:36.220 --> 01:59:39.500
and it was going to be in the home release and everything, and now it's not...

01:59:39.500 --> 01:59:42.700
well, we don't know yet, but now it's questionable if it's coming or not.

01:59:42.700 --> 01:59:47.140
Well, you know,

01:59:47.140 --> 01:59:50.740
DDR doesn't make you a better dancer, so that's one thing out, you know.

01:59:50.740 --> 02:00:00.740
I really can't think of anything else that they could really, there's that, you know, dinky little RPG mode thing, right?

02:00:00.740 --> 02:00:02.740
And that's in Ultramix 3.

02:00:02.740 --> 02:00:04.740
Oh, Ultramix 3. No, I can't.

02:00:04.740 --> 02:00:06.740
I really hope they're demoing that.

02:00:06.740 --> 02:00:12.740
DDR whack-a-mole! Oh my god, that would be, they need to put DDR whack-a-mole in.

02:00:12.740 --> 02:00:15.740
Wouldn't the makers of spider stomps to them?

02:00:15.740 --> 02:00:17.740
But that's not really whack-a-mole.

02:00:17.740 --> 02:00:19.740
Oh, because it's moles and not spiders.

02:00:19.740 --> 02:00:26.240
And they don't pop up out of the ground and you're not you're actually stepping on the thing itself

02:00:26.240 --> 02:00:33.480
But this is the the there's no TV on spider-stomp either. So aha. I know my legal crap. It's in a different cabinet

02:00:34.800 --> 02:00:40.040
No infringement there. No, not at all. Okay, um

02:00:41.800 --> 02:00:47.600
Loki popped into chat really fast. I guess he managed to tear himself away for a little bit to listen to the little show. Hi

02:00:47.600 --> 02:00:53.060
he says and I quote nothing much is happening in the sim scene just more

02:00:53.060 --> 02:00:57.420
crappy sim files see I called it you know what we ought to just fire Loki

02:00:57.420 --> 02:01:01.020
because I'm able to do the sim scene report myself every week no I'm kidding

02:01:01.020 --> 02:01:03.860
we would never do that he'll be back next week he'll be with us for the

02:01:03.860 --> 02:01:08.220
podcast as well all right last call for the cage match

02:01:08.220 --> 02:01:14.180
votes you guys get him in here also what we're gonna do next break I think we're

02:01:14.180 --> 02:01:18.660
to try and do that list list except my roommate is getting cold feet now he doesn't want to do it

02:01:18.660 --> 02:01:24.740
so so how about we have to uh we can't do two skype lines you know we'll just have three people

02:01:24.740 --> 02:01:30.500
we'll do a three person list one put one person in chat in uh p.m okay and one person on skype

02:01:30.500 --> 02:01:33.620
line so one person in private message and one person on skype line all right i'll try to figure

02:01:33.620 --> 02:01:38.740
out who those people are gonna be i'm picking trivia question trivia question it's an easy one

02:01:38.740 --> 02:01:40.740
Who is my favorite?

02:01:40.740 --> 02:01:44.740
No, no, no. No, no, no. No question. I want to pick the people who are doing it, if that's okay.

02:01:44.740 --> 02:01:47.740
No, seriously. I think that we should give a fair opportunity.

02:01:47.740 --> 02:01:51.740
All right. How about we Skype in somebody I want and we'll let somebody from the chatroom do it?

02:01:51.740 --> 02:01:53.740
Okay. So the trivia question...

02:01:53.740 --> 02:01:54.740
Wait, wait, wait. Don't give the trivia question yet because I'm still...

02:01:54.740 --> 02:01:55.740
Well, I want them to think about it.

02:01:55.740 --> 02:01:57.740
I'm tallying cage match votes. I don't want them to send it in yet.

02:01:57.740 --> 02:01:58.740
Well, don't...

02:01:58.740 --> 02:02:02.740
All right.

02:02:02.740 --> 02:02:06.740
Hold on. I'll finish up. Any thoughts you have for us, Jamie?

02:02:06.740 --> 02:02:11.740
Well, on Monday, we happen to have Diversion that starts at a noon time to me.

02:02:11.740 --> 02:02:12.740
7 o'clock?

02:02:12.740 --> 02:02:13.740
Actually, Diversion got cancelled.

02:02:13.740 --> 02:02:14.740
What?

02:02:14.740 --> 02:02:15.740
Diversion's cancelled, remember?

02:02:15.740 --> 02:02:16.740
You should have told me this stuff.

02:02:16.740 --> 02:02:17.740
Sorry.

02:02:17.740 --> 02:02:21.740
This is what I get for sleeping through a board meeting.

02:02:21.740 --> 02:02:22.740
Fuck.

02:02:22.740 --> 02:02:29.740
Coming soon to Orange Lounge Radio, the Dance Mania show is coming to Monday nights through

02:02:29.740 --> 02:02:31.740
a plane to Diversion.

02:02:31.740 --> 02:02:32.740
Yes.

02:02:32.740 --> 02:02:38.180
You better drink diet coke.

02:02:38.180 --> 02:02:39.180
Sorry.

02:02:39.180 --> 02:02:46.460
Tuesday, my show, which has been going strong since its conception that I started by accident

02:02:46.460 --> 02:02:47.460
when I got bored.

02:02:47.460 --> 02:02:53.940
Pump Up the Volume will continue pre-show as always starts at a quarter to seven just

02:02:53.940 --> 02:02:59.220
because I got really bored and started playing early one day and it stuck.

02:02:59.220 --> 02:03:03.780
The actual show will start at 7.30, and the concept is requesting stuff, but people don't

02:03:03.780 --> 02:03:05.780
request shit, so I just end up playing whatever.

02:03:05.780 --> 02:03:14.420
Of course, no show this week, because I will, again, be in a car on my way to E3, however,

02:03:14.420 --> 02:03:21.420
I will be coming back and filling your head with, I think, an anime marathon, I'm thinking

02:03:21.420 --> 02:03:22.420
this time.

02:03:22.420 --> 02:03:28.540
The last time, see, this, uh, I've noticed that the, uh, my pre-shows have been turning

02:03:28.540 --> 02:03:34.360
into sort of repeat performances of what you might hear on Pump Up the Volume. So, if you

02:03:34.360 --> 02:03:36.340
like what you hear on the pre-show, be sure to tune in.

02:03:36.340 --> 02:03:39.660
Alright, let's do the Cage Match winner. You ready?

02:03:39.660 --> 02:03:40.660
We don't have another show.

02:03:40.660 --> 02:03:42.660
No, we don't have another show right now.

02:03:42.660 --> 02:03:45.820
It's just me! It's the Jamie show!

02:03:45.820 --> 02:03:48.540
Jamie's by herself, and then we're gonna have a whole lot of new programming at the end

02:03:48.540 --> 02:03:49.540
of the month. I promise.

02:03:49.540 --> 02:03:51.860
But I still love you, and I will stay constant.

02:03:51.860 --> 02:03:55.420
I, however, do not. Okay, here we go.

02:03:55.420 --> 02:03:58.740
The winning song of tonight's cage match. Ready?

02:03:58.740 --> 02:04:02.060
Tonight's winning song is... a tie.

02:04:02.060 --> 02:04:05.700
Song number one that tied in tonight's cage match.

02:04:05.700 --> 02:04:08.540
IU

02:04:08.540 --> 02:04:13.860
appears. Kind of a given considering the crowd we got here. Song number three that tied

02:04:13.860 --> 02:04:14.980
in tonight's cage match.

02:04:14.980 --> 02:04:19.060
What the fuck?

02:04:19.060 --> 02:04:21.060
Okay.

02:04:21.060 --> 02:04:30.060
Ted Koppel's Gin and Juice, before you say anything, Jamie, let me remind folks, in case of a tie, the host whose song did not make the tie gets to break the tie.

02:04:30.060 --> 02:04:34.060
That being said, Jamie, tough decision here. What are you going to go with?

02:04:39.060 --> 02:04:41.060
Harlech.

02:04:41.060 --> 02:04:43.060
You can't vote for Harlech!

02:04:43.060 --> 02:04:48.500
You know what chat room, I'm going to torture you.

02:04:48.500 --> 02:04:52.500
I'm going to see you crack and bleeding under my whip.

02:04:52.500 --> 02:04:55.600
You get Ted Koppel.

02:04:55.600 --> 02:04:56.860
Jamie votes for Ted Koppel.

02:04:56.860 --> 02:05:04.340
Tortures flew to the White House today, confirmed that the President is late.

02:05:04.340 --> 02:05:10.360
I cannot believe that the song you gave a.5 to got your vote over the song that got

02:05:10.360 --> 02:05:12.920
the 7.

02:05:12.920 --> 02:05:15.580
I thought I had that win in the bag.

02:05:15.580 --> 02:05:18.920
Damn you.

02:05:18.920 --> 02:05:21.640
The Damon is hot.

02:05:21.640 --> 02:05:26.120
Dude, he's older and still hot. Dude, you lucked out with that win last week.

02:05:26.120 --> 02:05:29.460
Even you have to admit, even you have to admit, considering the Chairwoman's reaction, you

02:05:29.460 --> 02:05:31.520
lucked out with that win last week, so...

02:05:31.520 --> 02:05:32.680
Yeah, but...

02:05:32.680 --> 02:05:36.640
You weren't getting to it, Sarah. I have to make sure that I put in a song that won't win next week,

02:05:36.640 --> 02:05:40.020
because the week after is the week...

02:05:40.020 --> 02:05:41.460
is after...

02:05:41.460 --> 02:05:44.880
all that was a strategic vote that's what you were doing you did that so you

02:05:44.880 --> 02:05:46.380
could win next week

02:05:46.380 --> 02:05:49.740
but but i did want to make an announcement as i think i can legally get

02:05:49.740 --> 02:05:53.060
away with it as i'm going to be playing the entirety of demon days on the twenty

02:05:53.060 --> 02:05:53.960
third

02:05:53.960 --> 02:05:56.920
because it will have been released in uk

02:05:56.920 --> 02:06:01.400
super

02:06:01.400 --> 02:06:04.080
i don't get you jamie by the way i'm still i'm still

02:06:04.080 --> 02:06:06.560
and a woman

02:06:06.560 --> 02:06:09.540
and i write all right woman i don't get you

02:06:09.540 --> 02:06:14.540
I can change my mind and do everything I can to confuse men.

02:06:14.540 --> 02:06:16.540
Alright, alright, I'm done, I'm done.

02:06:16.540 --> 02:06:18.540
Um, here we go.

02:06:18.540 --> 02:06:19.540
The power of estrogen.

02:06:19.540 --> 02:06:21.540
Let's, listless.

02:06:21.540 --> 02:06:23.540
Let's remind...

02:06:24.540 --> 02:06:25.540
Shut up.

02:06:25.540 --> 02:06:26.540
Listless.

02:06:26.540 --> 02:06:28.540
Make me!

02:06:28.540 --> 02:06:37.540
The way listless works, we are going to come up with the definitive list of things for Orange Lounge Radio to stick on the E3 Katamari.

02:06:37.540 --> 02:06:38.540
The definitive list, okay?

02:06:38.540 --> 02:06:44.000
Okay, the way it works, we, myself, Jamie, and two mystery guests will be coming up with

02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:49.640
a list of four, is it four items or three, I'm sorry, three items each, and then we each

02:06:49.640 --> 02:06:53.800
take one off the list, and you guys get to vote on the defendant list.

02:06:53.800 --> 02:06:56.160
We'll explain it as we move on.

02:06:56.160 --> 02:07:00.120
In order for us to get to that point though, we need a contestant from chat.

02:07:00.120 --> 02:07:04.200
I'm going to get somebody on Skype, I'm going to hand pick one of our guests to get on Skype,

02:07:04.200 --> 02:07:07.160
but we are going to have a contest in the chat room to see who gets in there.

02:07:07.160 --> 02:07:10.680
the first person to answer this correctly is going to be doing the other

02:07:10.680 --> 02:07:14.240
list but you please don't answer unless you have some ideas for this list list

02:07:14.240 --> 02:07:16.720
because I don't want you sitting there going I don't know I'll tell you what

02:07:16.720 --> 02:07:21.400
send the p.m. to me so that Rob is not inundated with p.m.s okay thank you I'm

02:07:21.400 --> 02:07:27.480
in the chat room is dark Sakura SSF the question is that already Oh amazing and

02:07:27.480 --> 02:07:33.920
beautiful chat room that I use the terms loosely oh who is my favorite member of

02:07:33.920 --> 02:07:34.920
Gorillaz.

02:07:34.920 --> 02:07:41.080
Who is my favorite member of the band, the animated band themselves?

02:07:41.080 --> 02:07:44.020
Favorite member of the animated band Gorillaz, and if you've been paying attention to this

02:07:44.020 --> 02:07:45.840
show in the past few weeks, you should know.

02:07:45.840 --> 02:07:51.120
First person to send that correctly over private message to Jamie will get the privilege, listeners

02:07:51.120 --> 02:07:55.840
never get this privilege, this is a special night, your lucky Loki's not here, to participate

02:07:55.840 --> 02:07:56.840
in Listless with us.

02:07:56.840 --> 02:08:00.840
Meanwhile, I'm going to hook up somebody over Skype, I'm going to find somebody on Skype.

02:08:00.840 --> 02:08:07.680
We will be back after this, featuring some music from, um, well, no, more potpourri, I think.

02:08:07.680 --> 02:08:12.240
But we're gonna start it off with Burning Heat, because that song, Genna Juice, gives me burning heat.

02:08:13.240 --> 02:08:14.480
Gives me burning itch.

02:08:14.480 --> 02:08:16.480
Alright, here we go. We'll be back after this.

02:09:44.480 --> 02:09:46.480
You

02:11:14.480 --> 02:11:41.880
Baby, you're all that I want When you look back, I know that you're all

02:11:41.880 --> 02:11:53.880
When you're lying here in my eyes I'm finding it hard to believe we're in heaven

02:11:53.880 --> 02:12:20.400
Oh, I'm thinking about our younger years There was only you and me

02:12:20.400 --> 02:12:24.400
We were young and wild and free

02:12:25.400 --> 02:12:29.400
Now nothing can take you away from me

02:12:30.400 --> 02:12:33.400
We've been through that road before

02:12:34.400 --> 02:12:36.400
That's over now

02:12:37.400 --> 02:12:41.400
Keep me coming back for more

02:12:42.400 --> 02:12:44.400
Baby you're all that I want

02:12:45.400 --> 02:12:47.400
When you're lying here in my head

02:12:47.400 --> 02:12:54.400
I'm finding it hard to believe we're in heaven

02:12:54.400 --> 02:12:58.400
And while there's all that I need

02:12:58.400 --> 02:13:02.400
And I'm falling down in your heart

02:13:02.400 --> 02:13:05.400
It isn't too hard to see

02:13:05.400 --> 02:13:12.400
We're in heaven

02:13:42.400 --> 02:13:59.400
Mmm, still I whisper all my lips The feeling in my fingertips is boiling at my skin

02:13:59.400 --> 02:14:14.400
Leave me one of my thoughts, feelin' as if I've been just the colder you've been

02:14:14.400 --> 02:14:22.400
Days goodbye and still I think of you

02:14:22.400 --> 02:14:28.400
Days when I couldn't live my life without you

02:14:29.400 --> 02:14:31.400
Without you

02:14:31.400 --> 02:14:57.720
Hello, hello, is this thing on testing?

02:14:57.720 --> 02:14:58.720
Testing one, two.

02:14:58.720 --> 02:15:02.720
I'm looking in the index, but I don't see anything for how to run a radio show.

02:15:02.720 --> 02:15:05.720
Hello? I don't understand this.

02:15:05.720 --> 02:15:06.720
This thing works.

02:15:06.720 --> 02:15:08.720
This thing reads like stereo instructions.

02:15:08.720 --> 02:15:09.720
Is this on?

02:15:09.720 --> 02:15:10.720
What the hell?

02:15:11.720 --> 02:15:13.720
Orange Lounge Radio.

02:15:13.720 --> 02:15:15.720
Broke-down ghetto bimani radio.

02:15:15.720 --> 02:15:17.720
What the f***?

02:15:19.720 --> 02:15:26.720
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, and we are going to do some list lists.

02:15:26.720 --> 02:15:27.720
Yay!

02:15:27.720 --> 02:15:31.280
So, the way Listless works, just a quick reminder.

02:15:31.280 --> 02:15:34.360
Huh? We're doing three, just three.

02:15:34.360 --> 02:15:37.960
We are each going to pick our top three, myself,

02:15:37.960 --> 02:15:41.160
DarkSakura, and who is the year winner, DarkSakura?

02:15:41.160 --> 02:15:45.180
Our winner is Ranma! Ranma, okay, and then we're going to get somebody special here on the

02:15:45.180 --> 02:15:46.140
Skype line right now.

02:15:46.140 --> 02:15:49.840
Doopie doopie doo, just waiting for the phone.

02:15:49.840 --> 02:15:53.880
One ringy dingy. Hello?

02:15:53.880 --> 02:15:55.880
Is this, uh, Miklotov?

02:15:55.880 --> 02:15:57.880
Hello?

02:15:57.880 --> 02:15:59.880
Hello? Miklotov?

02:15:59.880 --> 02:16:00.880
Yeah?

02:16:00.880 --> 02:16:02.880
Can you hear me?

02:16:05.880 --> 02:16:07.880
I don't know if he can hear me. Are you there?

02:16:07.880 --> 02:16:09.880
I can hear you.

02:16:09.880 --> 02:16:11.880
Okay, but you can't hear yourself?

02:16:13.880 --> 02:16:15.880
What? What are you talking about?

02:16:15.880 --> 02:16:16.880
Can you hear me?

02:16:16.880 --> 02:16:17.880
I'm confused.

02:16:17.880 --> 02:16:19.880
He can hear us!

02:16:19.880 --> 02:16:21.880
We can hear him. We're good.

02:16:21.880 --> 02:16:27.880
Okay, good. You just freaked me out for a little bit there. Damn. All right.

02:16:27.880 --> 02:16:29.880
I'm sorry.

02:16:29.880 --> 02:16:31.880
That's all right. How you doing, sir?

02:16:31.880 --> 02:16:33.880
I'm doing pretty well.

02:16:33.880 --> 02:16:35.880
Looking forward to E3 next week?

02:16:35.880 --> 02:16:38.880
To what?

02:16:38.880 --> 02:16:40.880
Are you looking forward to E3 next week?

02:16:40.880 --> 02:16:42.880
Yeah.

02:16:42.880 --> 02:16:44.880
Okay.

02:16:44.880 --> 02:16:47.880
You're breaking up because you're on the computer.

02:16:47.880 --> 02:16:49.880
Oh, I'm sorry.

02:16:49.880 --> 02:16:51.880
Okay, now I think I can hear you better.

02:16:51.880 --> 02:16:53.880
Okay, there you go.

02:16:53.880 --> 02:16:56.880
Are you going to stick things on the Katamari?

02:16:56.880 --> 02:16:57.880
Yeah.

02:16:57.880 --> 02:16:58.880
Okay, good.

02:16:58.880 --> 02:16:59.880
I plan, I hopefully will.

02:16:59.880 --> 02:17:00.880
All right.

02:17:00.880 --> 02:17:03.880
Well, we're going to get your top three, but you have to wait your turn.

02:17:03.880 --> 02:17:04.880
So you have your list ready?

02:17:04.880 --> 02:17:05.880
It's my turn?

02:17:05.880 --> 02:17:07.880
No, it's not your turn yet.

02:17:07.880 --> 02:17:08.880
I'll let you know when.

02:17:08.880 --> 02:17:11.880
You're going to give us your answers, okay?

02:17:11.880 --> 02:17:12.880
Okay.

02:17:12.880 --> 02:17:14.880
See, this is why we don't do the Skype thing very often.

02:17:14.880 --> 02:17:15.880
No, I'm kidding.

02:17:15.880 --> 02:17:16.880
I'm kidding.

02:17:16.880 --> 02:17:18.880
Okay, let's start off with Jamie.

02:17:18.880 --> 02:17:22.320
oh actually I gotta explain this one more time how this works we will name

02:17:22.320 --> 02:17:29.000
our top three and then after we each give our top three each one of us gets

02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:35.580
to vote one off so then after each one song has been voted off we will have a

02:17:35.580 --> 02:17:39.640
list of eight because we'll have two from each person left while the list of

02:17:39.640 --> 02:17:44.160
eight and then the chat room gets to vote on their favorite to come up with a

02:17:44.160 --> 02:17:50.760
top three list. So tonight's list list, things we want to stick on the Katamari at E3 or

02:17:50.760 --> 02:17:56.180
should I say things we should stick on the Katamari at E3. I'll go first. I'm actually

02:17:56.180 --> 02:18:00.240
stealing ideas from the chatroom tonight because I think they actually have some decent ideas

02:18:00.240 --> 02:18:06.300
and my number three pick is Kalamari, as somebody said because I think the phrase sticking Kalamari

02:18:06.300 --> 02:18:11.580
on the Katamari is kind of cute and it sounds like it actually could be a song in Katamari

02:18:11.580 --> 02:18:20.420
Yamashi 2. So I'm saying Calamari. Alright. Miklatov, what's your number three pick for

02:18:20.420 --> 02:18:26.180
things that you want to stick on the Katamari? Well, I would like to put Mad Catz on the

02:18:26.180 --> 02:18:30.100
Katamari, just so it could be rolled away and shot off into space so they don't have

02:18:30.100 --> 02:18:35.880
anything to do with Pump It Up. Okay. So he's going to stick the entire company

02:18:35.880 --> 02:18:39.340
of Mad Catz. All of Mad Catz. That's what I wanted.

02:18:39.340 --> 02:18:43.660
So you're going to have to get the prince to roll up a big katamari first, and we're

02:18:43.660 --> 02:18:45.620
just going to roll over the Mad Catz building.

02:18:45.620 --> 02:18:46.620
Yeah, yeah.

02:18:46.620 --> 02:18:50.540
Well, hopefully, if it's Mad Catz, it shouldn't be that big.

02:18:50.540 --> 02:18:53.660
I can get a little binky-sized one.

02:18:53.660 --> 02:18:54.660
All right, good.

02:18:54.660 --> 02:18:57.380
Mad Catz will be stuck on the katamari by Mikolatov.

02:18:57.380 --> 02:18:58.380
Excellent.

02:18:58.380 --> 02:19:01.380
All right, let's see.

02:19:01.380 --> 02:19:04.100
Ranma's number three.

02:19:04.100 --> 02:19:08.300
His number three pick that he wants to put on the katamari, he being the contest winner

02:19:08.300 --> 02:19:12.640
from our channel, by the way. Rama would like to put a Mustang on the katamari. I have no

02:19:12.640 --> 02:19:15.640
idea why. He didn't send me a reason why, but he wants to put a Mustang on there.

02:19:15.640 --> 02:19:32.640
All right. A little bit of dead air there, sorry. Jamie, your number three pick.

02:19:32.640 --> 02:19:37.060
The Gorilla's Jeep, spelled G-E-E-P. The Gorilla's Jeep. Why the Jeep?

02:19:37.060 --> 02:19:43.060
Well, at least what's left of it, since it's apparently smashed all over the basement under the car park.

02:19:44.060 --> 02:19:46.060
You do understand it's a cartoon, right?

02:19:48.060 --> 02:19:49.060
You shut up!

02:19:51.060 --> 02:19:55.060
Alright, um, let's see, did Raman tell me why the Mustang?

02:19:55.060 --> 02:19:59.060
Oh, okay, he says, Mustang cars rock. I love them.

02:19:59.060 --> 02:20:00.060
Yes, they do.

02:20:00.060 --> 02:20:01.060
Alright.

02:20:01.060 --> 02:20:06.060
Um, let's see, my number two pick for something I want to put on the Katamari.

02:20:06.060 --> 02:20:13.180
My number two pick is, originally I said let's take all of Lanky Style's Paulus Terry CDs

02:20:13.180 --> 02:20:17.420
and put them on the Katamari so we can be rid of them forever, but actually somebody

02:20:17.420 --> 02:20:20.220
in the chat room came up with something better, so I went with this.

02:20:20.220 --> 02:20:26.180
Put all of the Shitty Max 300 remixes on one CD and put it on the Katamari.

02:20:26.180 --> 02:20:29.540
So all the Shitty Max remixes, let's just roll them away.

02:20:29.540 --> 02:20:36.500
So ShittyMax300RemixCD is my number two pick.

02:20:36.500 --> 02:20:40.220
Meek Latov, what's your number two pick?

02:20:40.220 --> 02:20:47.700
I would want to put the tiniest picture of a bear I could on the Katamari, and you would

02:20:47.700 --> 02:20:51.420
understand it if you played the game.

02:20:51.420 --> 02:20:54.680
So if you've actually played the game, you'll understand why he wants to put the tiniest

02:20:54.680 --> 02:20:55.940
picture of a bear.

02:20:55.940 --> 02:21:04.160
really pissed me off when making the Ursa major. Alright, number 2 from Rama, I'm reading

02:21:04.160 --> 02:21:10.300
it from the chat room, he's going to put a Big Mac with cheese on the katamari. Although

02:21:10.300 --> 02:21:13.340
you have to remember, no food is supposed to be on the katamari. Did they say no food?

02:21:13.340 --> 02:21:16.820
I think so. I don't think they did, I think they only said clothes and x-rated things.

02:21:16.820 --> 02:21:20.280
No, I don't think food's included. Oh well, I said katamari, so we'll let them say Big

02:21:20.280 --> 02:21:27.280
Mac. Big Mac because it would be fun to roll it and see if it is edible. Ew. Ew. Alright,

02:21:29.400 --> 02:21:36.400
Jamie, what's your number two? The Retard Ferret. And the Retard Ferret is the one that

02:21:38.440 --> 02:21:41.440
keeps making the same noise over and over. We actually are going to put that on the Katamari,

02:21:41.440 --> 02:21:48.100
by the way. Yes. Okay. Uh, my number one choice. Here it is. My number one choice for things

02:21:48.100 --> 02:21:53.980
I want to put on the Katamari. I want to put a copy of Katamari Damacy on the Katamari

02:21:53.980 --> 02:21:55.580
just to be ironic.

02:21:55.580 --> 02:22:00.140
That would be funny. You know, we could do that. Not like actually put the game on there,

02:22:00.140 --> 02:22:03.540
but like do like a blank CD-R with the label on it. That would be funny.

02:22:03.540 --> 02:22:06.300
Yeah, because they would so love pirated versions of their...

02:22:06.300 --> 02:22:08.300
No, a blank CD-R, I said.

02:22:08.300 --> 02:22:09.700
Oh, okay, okay.

02:22:09.700 --> 02:22:13.840
Miklotov, your number one pick for something that should be on the Katamari.

02:22:13.840 --> 02:22:19.400
I want to put a bumble ball on it, because it looks like a katamari.

02:22:19.400 --> 02:22:20.400
A bumble ball?

02:22:20.400 --> 02:22:22.960
Oh my god, he's right, they do look like a katamari.

02:22:22.960 --> 02:22:24.680
They totally look like katamaris.

02:22:24.680 --> 02:22:26.920
See, he's being ironic too.

02:22:26.920 --> 02:22:29.240
Good pick, Miggletove.

02:22:29.240 --> 02:22:32.140
Rama, number one.

02:22:32.140 --> 02:22:38.920
He wants to put a Nintendo DS on the katamari, because the DS is too awesome not to put on

02:22:38.920 --> 02:22:39.920
there.

02:22:39.920 --> 02:22:46.880
that that's about the only good thing your DS can do right now I know e3 will

02:22:46.880 --> 02:22:51.520
change our minds the Nintendo DS will be beautiful after e3 but right now I'm

02:22:51.520 --> 02:22:58.000
kind of pissed because like you call polarium a game all right what's your

02:22:58.000 --> 02:23:05.920
number one dark Sakura a gigantic huge mungus reject false icon sticker reject

02:23:05.920 --> 02:23:12.340
false icons sticker and why is that because when it the giant katamari will

02:23:12.340 --> 02:23:16.360
probably be made up of a bunch of false icons and what better to put on it than

02:23:16.360 --> 02:23:20.400
a big sticker it doesn't that they should all go do something useful like

02:23:20.400 --> 02:23:24.280
be a real star there you go all right now listen carefully

02:23:24.280 --> 02:23:28.160
Miklotov and Rama in the chat room listen carefully because you have to

02:23:28.160 --> 02:23:33.940
figure out which one of these you want to vote off of the list okay one of

02:23:33.940 --> 02:23:40.360
these, you have to vote off the list. I will start. Did I start? Yeah, I did. Uh, here

02:23:40.360 --> 02:23:50.600
it is. Calamari, Mad Cats, Mustang, Gorilla's Jeep, Shitty Max 300 Remix CD, Tiniest Picture

02:23:50.600 --> 02:23:59.340
of a Bear, Big Mac with Cheese, Retard Ferret, a copy of Katamari Damacy, Bumble Ball, Nintendo

02:23:59.340 --> 02:24:02.820
DS, and a Reject False Icon sticker.

02:24:02.820 --> 02:24:10.340
I am going to take off a big mac with cheese because that's just kind of weird.

02:24:10.340 --> 02:24:14.180
Sorry, Ranma, but I don't even like McDonald's to begin with, except I do like that walnut

02:24:14.180 --> 02:24:15.180
salad they have now.

02:24:15.180 --> 02:24:16.180
It's actually kind of yummy.

02:24:16.180 --> 02:24:17.180
The cob salad's pretty good.

02:24:17.180 --> 02:24:18.180
All right.

02:24:18.180 --> 02:24:19.180
Miklotov, you there?

02:24:19.180 --> 02:24:20.180
Miklotov?

02:24:20.180 --> 02:24:21.180
Yeah.

02:24:21.180 --> 02:24:22.180
Okay.

02:24:22.180 --> 02:24:26.380
What are you taking off the list?

02:24:26.380 --> 02:24:27.380
A Mustang.

02:24:27.380 --> 02:24:28.380
The Mustang.

02:24:28.380 --> 02:24:29.380
Why the Mustang?

02:24:29.380 --> 02:24:32.380
It doesn't make any sense to me.

02:24:32.380 --> 02:24:43.380
Okay, poor Ranma. Like, his whole list just almost got axed. Alright, um, Ranma hasn't sent me which one he's gonna vote off yet, so I guess, Jamie, you're gonna be next.

02:24:43.380 --> 02:24:44.380
Let me see the list.

02:24:46.380 --> 02:24:47.380
Bye.

02:24:47.380 --> 02:24:53.380
Sorry. Um, Dark Sakura, here it is. Do you need that a little bigger there?

02:24:53.380 --> 02:24:54.380
Um, don't highlight it, please.

02:24:54.380 --> 02:24:55.380
Oh, sorry.

02:24:55.380 --> 02:24:56.380
I didn't need it bigger. Just don't highlight it.

02:24:56.380 --> 02:24:57.380
My bad.

02:24:57.380 --> 02:24:59.380
Uh...

02:25:03.380 --> 02:25:05.380
Uh, God.

02:25:06.380 --> 02:25:08.380
You know what? Take off mad cats because then...

02:25:08.380 --> 02:25:10.380
Aww.

02:25:10.380 --> 02:25:14.380
Because I would rather see them explode instead of, you know, not be...

02:25:14.380 --> 02:25:18.380
They would be stardust and not a star, okay?

02:25:20.380 --> 02:25:25.380
Alright, that's good. Oh no, Rama just said the same thing in his private message.

02:25:25.380 --> 02:25:30.280
Huh, okay. Okay. Okay. You can leave his on. I'll pick another. Okay, fine. Then Rama took mad cats off

02:25:30.280 --> 02:25:32.960
I guess is the way that works. Okay, then what are you taking off Jamie?

02:25:36.200 --> 02:25:40.080
The Nintendo DS. You just axed Rama's whole list.

02:25:42.360 --> 02:25:44.360
Okay, okay, what?

02:25:45.240 --> 02:25:49.300
Kalamari, because that shit will stink. That's true. Kalamari will stink. All right.

02:25:50.160 --> 02:25:54.200
Okay, so here we are. Here it is. Here's the list. Gorilla's Jeep.

02:25:54.200 --> 02:25:57.320
a shitty Max 300 remix CD,

02:25:57.320 --> 02:26:01.160
the tiniest picture of a bear, the retard ferret,

02:26:01.160 --> 02:26:04.480
a copy of Katamari Damacy, Bumble Ball,

02:26:04.480 --> 02:26:08.200
Nintendo DS, and a large reject false icon stickers.

02:26:08.200 --> 02:26:13.000
Place your vote now, send a private message to Sky with what you want to be at

02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:13.640
the top

02:26:13.640 --> 02:26:17.440
of this definitive list. Thanks for playing, Mikl Tov. Appreciate it.

02:26:17.440 --> 02:26:22.920
Hey, what are your plans for E3 next week? What do you hope to see at the show?

02:26:22.920 --> 02:26:28.920
Um, I'm actually really looking forward to going to play Fantasy Star Universe.

02:26:28.920 --> 02:26:30.920
I didn't know it was going to be there.

02:26:30.920 --> 02:26:33.920
Yeah, his voice is kind of quiet. Sorry guys, it's Fantasy Star Universe is what he said.

02:26:33.920 --> 02:26:35.920
I'm looking forward to that as well.

02:26:35.920 --> 02:26:37.920
He played PSL Blue Burst with us last night.

02:26:37.920 --> 02:26:39.920
Yeah, it was fun. Good times.

02:26:39.920 --> 02:26:40.920
It was awesome.

02:26:40.920 --> 02:26:44.920
It was good. And now that I'm in the caves, I can like level more faster.

02:26:44.920 --> 02:26:47.920
Thank you for letting me leech all the loot, because I was poor.

02:26:47.920 --> 02:26:49.920
It's okay.

02:26:49.920 --> 02:26:57.760
have to play again. If I didn't have to pack tonight, I would totally play more.

02:26:57.760 --> 02:27:03.440
I get to pack tomorrow. My ass is playing. 24 hours from now, I will be at the More Friends

02:27:03.440 --> 02:27:10.060
concert. You know what, I don't get to pack. Go to hell. Go to hell. Alright, anything

02:27:10.060 --> 02:27:15.960
else you want to share with our listeners? Not really. Go back to play some Guild Wars

02:27:15.960 --> 02:27:18.320
probably. Alright, have fun. I'm hanging up on you.

02:27:18.320 --> 02:27:22.640
Okay. All right, bye. Well, that was fun.

02:27:22.640 --> 02:27:25.700
It's good to have him on the show, even if his phone is insanely quiet. I don't know

02:27:25.700 --> 02:27:26.380
why that is.

02:27:26.380 --> 02:27:29.420
It's just our connection. It's a bad connection. Okay.

02:27:29.420 --> 02:27:32.920
What we're gonna do now is we're gonna go to a quick break and we're gonna come up with

02:27:32.920 --> 02:27:36.420
that definitive list and then we will get into the FUs of the Week as well.

02:27:36.420 --> 02:27:36.980
However,

02:27:36.980 --> 02:27:40.740
please do not send in your FUs of the Week yet or they will get lost

02:27:40.740 --> 02:27:43.980
with the votes for listless. So,

02:27:43.980 --> 02:27:45.980
We're going to go to a break

02:27:47.780 --> 02:27:51.700
By the way, which also got brought up in there before we go to break we should mention this real briefly

02:27:51.700 --> 02:27:59.060
It's been mentioned twice in the show. Now mad cats will be publishing pump it up to which some of us go. Oh god

02:28:01.800 --> 02:28:04.560
It gets the DMV sighs, yeah

02:28:04.560 --> 02:28:11.640

02:28:11.640 --> 02:28:17.460

songs I know this for a fact and we'll be back after this with more orange on

02:28:24.460 --> 02:28:28.220

Yup, get finisher votes, last call for votes on listless.

I just need my love for you I need to know, I need to know, I need to

02:30:54.740 --> 02:30:56.880
I used to fly my love for you

02:30:58.140 --> 02:31:00.560
I used to fly my love for you

02:31:01.580 --> 02:31:04.680
I'm giving all my heart to you my love

02:31:05.140 --> 02:31:07.500
I used to fly my love for you

02:31:08.460 --> 02:31:11.540
I'm giving you my heart and soul my love

02:31:11.840 --> 02:31:14.360
I used to fly my love for you

02:31:15.340 --> 02:31:18.360
I'm giving all my heart to you my love

02:31:18.780 --> 02:31:20.940
I used to fly my love for you

02:31:20.940 --> 02:31:27.940
I'm giving you my heart and all of my love I used to live in love with you

02:34:50.940 --> 02:35:14.540
to do for you?

02:35:14.540 --> 02:35:34.100
Hi, we're back on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:35:34.100 --> 02:35:39.500
I was just barking E3 orders to Dark Sakura there during break.

02:35:39.500 --> 02:35:40.500
Sorry.

02:35:40.500 --> 02:35:43.100
You know I love you.

02:35:43.100 --> 02:35:44.180
I'm just giving a heads up.

02:35:44.180 --> 02:35:48.520
I do not want chaos like last year. I was pissed off after that night last year.

02:35:48.520 --> 02:35:51.860
What?

02:35:51.860 --> 02:35:56.700
I don't get, I don't, despite my on-air persona, I don't get bitchy in real life

02:35:56.700 --> 02:35:58.020
that often, but that

02:35:58.020 --> 02:36:01.380
got me really bitchy, so just... You're funny when you're bitchy.

02:36:01.380 --> 02:36:07.220
You are damn hilarious when you're bitchy. Because I get totally faggy, and I can say that

02:36:07.220 --> 02:36:07.980
because I am a fag.

02:36:07.980 --> 02:36:11.220
I get totally faggy, you know, when I'm bitchy and just like

02:36:11.220 --> 02:36:13.220
Uh-uh, uh-uh.

02:36:13.220 --> 02:36:14.500
Anyway.

02:36:14.500 --> 02:36:15.980
Girl.

02:36:15.980 --> 02:36:18.540
Just not going through that again.

02:36:18.540 --> 02:36:23.260
I have that stuck in my head because I listened to that newer

02:36:23.260 --> 02:36:24.780
Margaret Cho thing that you sent me.

02:36:24.780 --> 02:36:25.860
Oh, the Florida Master.

02:36:25.860 --> 02:36:28.180
Yeah, and I'm like, girl.

02:36:28.180 --> 02:36:29.300
Oh, girl.

02:36:32.660 --> 02:36:35.300
Oh my god, Shane knew exactly what I was talking about.

02:36:35.300 --> 02:36:39.140
He just posted it in the chat room.

02:36:39.140 --> 02:36:41.020
Yes, you're right, Shane, by the way.

02:36:41.020 --> 02:36:46.560
Okay, um, let's reveal the winner, or I'm sorry, the definitive list as voted on by

02:36:46.560 --> 02:36:47.560
you guys.

02:36:47.560 --> 02:36:49.560
Here it is, the definitive list.

02:36:49.560 --> 02:36:53.560
Top things you want to see stuck on the giant Katamari ball at E3.

02:36:53.560 --> 02:36:57.080
Number three, reject false icon sticker.

02:36:57.080 --> 02:36:59.080
A very large reject false icon sticker.

02:36:59.080 --> 02:37:00.400
Ooh, gorillas!

02:37:00.400 --> 02:37:01.920
Alright.

02:37:01.920 --> 02:37:07.360
Number two, a shitty Max 300 remix CD.

02:37:07.360 --> 02:37:13.160
And the number one thing you would like to have stuck on the Katamari Damacy Ball at

02:37:13.160 --> 02:37:16.200
E3 is a copy of Katamari Damacy.

02:37:16.200 --> 02:37:19.720
You guys are so ironic, I love you all.

02:37:19.720 --> 02:37:24.960
It's like Ray-yain on your wedding day.

02:37:24.960 --> 02:37:26.960
I'm a little too ironic.

02:37:26.960 --> 02:37:27.960
Don't you think?

02:37:27.960 --> 02:37:35.060
Yeah, a little too rough, sorry, but not really.

02:37:35.060 --> 02:37:42.060
I'm sorry, but if you can have your Gorillaz thing, then I'm entitled to this little clip

02:37:42.840 --> 02:37:47.840
that makes me think of what just happened there in Liz Liz.

02:37:47.840 --> 02:37:54.840
You are such an Atlanta tour. No, you guys should hear Robert Karaoke. He gets on stage

02:37:58.460 --> 02:38:04.300
in the question that passes through the entire karaoke room. Which Atlanta song is it this

02:38:04.300 --> 02:38:08.300
Next week, Rob!

02:38:08.300 --> 02:38:11.300
It's like rain, yeah.

02:38:11.300 --> 02:38:13.300
Okay, you have to do this one next time.

02:38:13.300 --> 02:38:14.300
I will.

02:38:14.300 --> 02:38:16.300
No, next time won't be it, Rocky.

02:38:16.300 --> 02:38:17.300
She's right, though.

02:38:17.300 --> 02:38:20.300
Yeah, it's gonna be like three weeks before I get to do karaoke.

02:38:20.300 --> 02:38:24.300
Unless something happens at E3, but I don't know.

02:38:24.300 --> 02:38:26.300
I need details on that, so whatever.

02:38:26.300 --> 02:38:29.300
Okay, anyway.

02:38:29.300 --> 02:38:31.300
That song isn't ironic.

02:38:31.300 --> 02:38:33.300
It's just unfortunate.

02:38:33.300 --> 02:38:34.300
It says MPQ.

02:38:34.300 --> 02:38:43.060
But see, and isn't it unfortunate, it doesn't have the same ring to it.

02:38:43.060 --> 02:38:46.940
And then, that's funny, because the way that goes is that MPQ goes, that song isn't ironic,

02:38:46.940 --> 02:38:51.100
it's just unfortunate, and dudes go, it's not a tumor.

02:38:51.100 --> 02:38:54.180
Girl.

02:38:54.180 --> 02:38:56.380
I can't do it the way she does.

02:38:56.380 --> 02:38:58.380
Oh, girl.

02:38:58.380 --> 02:38:59.380
Girl.

02:38:59.380 --> 02:39:01.380
Oh, girl.

02:39:01.380 --> 02:39:07.380
Yeah, now that we've lost half our audience there. Hey, at least we're not talking about the damn lawsuit anymore.

02:39:07.380 --> 02:39:15.380
Okay, um, here we go. FUs of the Week. And you have a new FU song. You couldn't just stick with one, could you, DarkSakura? You have a new one.

02:39:15.380 --> 02:39:20.380
Because people butched about my last one. I used it for other things on the show, so I found something more appropriate.

02:39:20.380 --> 02:39:24.380
Alright, here we go. And Jamie, why do we do the FUs every single week?

02:39:24.380 --> 02:39:29.380
every single week. Because we can.

02:39:29.380 --> 02:39:36.380
What better to illustrate my wrath than to use this era, a.k.a. the wrath of God.

02:39:44.020 --> 02:39:51.020
Girl. I can't do it. Okay. Big F you to the bitches who broke into Rob's car.

02:39:51.020 --> 02:40:00.860
into Rob's car. Thank you. You're welcome. Um, F you to missing out on homemade banana,

02:40:00.860 --> 02:40:08.540
oh not banana, coconut cream pie with extra coconut in it. I had a bite of it that was

02:40:08.540 --> 02:40:17.420
hot. Um, and then um, F you to uh, being so weak in blue burst that like one damn hit

02:40:17.420 --> 02:40:20.880
from the dragon put me down to four! Hit points!

02:40:20.880 --> 02:40:22.440
I have to level some more.

02:40:22.440 --> 02:40:26.400
You know, it's damn expensive to play as Romaro. God, you have to

02:40:26.400 --> 02:40:30.920
buy this, and buy that, and buy your...

02:40:30.920 --> 02:40:32.560
And I miss my, uh,

02:40:32.560 --> 02:40:36.640
hacked item from the Xbox one. I carry around a giant pink purse.

02:40:36.640 --> 02:40:38.840
So I miss that too.

02:40:38.840 --> 02:40:40.480
I want to carry a pink purse.

02:40:40.480 --> 02:40:43.140
Uh, eventually maybe?

02:40:43.140 --> 02:40:45.640
Um...

02:40:45.640 --> 02:40:47.800
I miss how rap used to.

02:40:47.800 --> 02:40:51.480
And F you to Loki's song,

02:40:51.480 --> 02:40:57.600
because it is annoying and I picked it just to annoy our listeners, because I love you all a little.

02:40:57.600 --> 02:41:01.680
And I'm not really too angsty, you know, I've been in a fantast- oh yeah.

02:41:01.680 --> 02:41:05.020
And F you- This song gets really quiet, by the way, towards the end.

02:41:05.020 --> 02:41:07.560
Well, fuck off to pick something else. I'm gonna loop it.

02:41:07.560 --> 02:41:14.000
Fuck you to having to pick another song, dammit.

02:41:14.000 --> 02:41:29.000
I have to wait for them to verify it again, and one man won't let me buy a mini disc player.

02:41:29.000 --> 02:41:34.000
You know, I think there should be a paypal account or something set up.

02:41:34.000 --> 02:41:38.000
It's called the Buy Dark Sakura Mini Disc Player Fund.

02:41:38.000 --> 02:41:41.000
Wouldn't that be awesome?

02:41:41.000 --> 02:41:46.280
for you. I need a mini disc player. Chat room, you love me right?

02:41:46.280 --> 02:41:49.640
Buy me one, please? Okay, I'm done.

02:41:49.640 --> 02:41:52.880
Let's get to Loki's FU. He actually sent me one.

02:41:52.880 --> 02:41:59.880
I wish I could read these like Loki does his FUs.

02:41:59.920 --> 02:42:03.560
I like your FUs.

02:42:03.560 --> 02:42:07.760
Just kidding. Loki's FU this week is

02:42:07.760 --> 02:42:13.320
towards German spammers I've been getting tons of German spam all day

02:42:13.320 --> 02:42:17.560
on my Yahoo account. That's his only FU.

02:42:17.560 --> 02:42:21.200
It's not as funny when I read them I'm sorry guys

02:42:21.200 --> 02:42:26.000
but now it's my turn.

02:42:26.000 --> 02:42:30.200
My FU goes to the little mother fucker with no balls that broke into my car this

02:42:30.200 --> 02:42:31.320
week fuck you

02:42:31.320 --> 02:42:34.720
I got the last laugh in the end because that fucking stereo you stole was broken

02:42:34.720 --> 02:42:39.720
Fuck you for stealing my class ring. I don't give a fuck if I hated high school. You had no right to take that shit.

02:42:39.720 --> 02:42:44.720
Why do people on this planet think that they can take shit that's not theirs? I hate you. Die.

02:42:44.720 --> 02:42:50.720
F you to the fact that I wasn't able to take a trip to the Bay Area this weekend because I was kind of looking forward to it.

02:42:50.720 --> 02:42:54.720
But there's just more important shit that's got to be done. F you to all the stress that comes before E3.

02:42:54.720 --> 02:42:59.720
F you to all the work that I'm going to have to be doing at E3 next week because I'm just supposed to go there and play games all day.

02:42:59.720 --> 02:43:07.720
No, I'm going to slave my butt off for you guys, so, you know, I hope that you guys just kiss my ass after this, because, you know, we're going to work it for you.

02:43:07.720 --> 02:43:17.720
I'm just kidding. I do it because I love you guys. But, damn, E3 is a lot of work. And F you to stress, and F you to the fact that I'm short on money right now because of a glitch and stuff I don't want to talk about.

02:43:17.720 --> 02:43:23.720
Yeah, that's it. That's my FUs of the Week. Let's get to the chatroom at FUs of the Week.

02:43:23.720 --> 02:43:31.280
This is the Captain Jack cover of Holiday by the way.

02:43:31.280 --> 02:43:34.920
Mikl Tov would like to give his first F.U. to his computer for randomly freezing when

02:43:34.920 --> 02:43:38.320
he's in the middle of Guild Wars or a Phantasy Star Blue Burst.

02:43:38.320 --> 02:43:41.440
Second F.U. is for that horrible American Dad show.

02:43:41.440 --> 02:43:46.040
The only redeeming factor on it, which isn't even enough to make me watch it, is Greg and

02:43:46.040 --> 02:43:48.000
Terry because they are adorable.

02:43:48.000 --> 02:43:53.040
And finally F.U. to my car making funny, funky noises.

02:43:53.040 --> 02:43:59.160
MPQ says, uh, I somehow expect half the people to F you the Konami vs. Rock Store thing,

02:43:59.160 --> 02:44:03.280
so I'm going with something different. Fuck Colors and 2DX, I will never beat that fucking

02:44:03.280 --> 02:44:07.800
song. Oh yeah, an F you to kicking and screaming, total waste of money, I walked out, it was

02:44:07.800 --> 02:44:10.160
so bad.

02:44:10.160 --> 02:44:16.400
Doob says, F you to Brazilian people who play MMORPGs because they can't speak proper English.

02:44:16.400 --> 02:44:19.880
F you to being a high school freshman because when I think, yay, school is almost over,

02:44:19.880 --> 02:44:22.920
I think, oh crap, three more years left.

02:44:22.920 --> 02:44:24.920
We just need to learn to speak Portuguese.

02:44:24.920 --> 02:44:27.920
I think we should just stick doobs in a trash can.

02:44:27.920 --> 02:44:29.920
No, because he's a Gorillas fan now.

02:44:29.920 --> 02:44:31.920
You know how we used to do to freshmen in high school,

02:44:31.920 --> 02:44:33.920
is you'd stick them in the trash can and you'd can them?

02:44:33.920 --> 02:44:37.920
We'd tell them that there was a pool under the gym,

02:44:37.920 --> 02:44:40.920
and so then pass us to use it, and then an elevator pass.

02:44:40.920 --> 02:44:43.920
Even though your school was on one floor?

02:44:43.920 --> 02:44:44.920
We were two floors.

02:44:44.920 --> 02:44:48.920
Oh, our school was only one floor, and people would sell elevator passes.

02:44:48.920 --> 02:44:54.520
Rama says F you to my co-workers for screwing me out of my time off for an amazement on Memorial Day weekend

02:44:54.600 --> 02:44:57.200
Don't say shit when I put the screws to you. Oh

02:44:58.120 --> 02:45:00.120
girl

02:45:00.280 --> 02:45:02.760
Dark Knight says a big F you to singlehood and

02:45:05.040 --> 02:45:07.040
That's it

02:45:08.720 --> 02:45:12.220
Lemon lime I just got to screw you giant screw you sky in the chair

02:45:12.220 --> 02:45:18.220
Lemon Lime Jumps says, F you to the Domino's Cheeseburger Pizza for being really disgusting.

02:45:18.220 --> 02:45:21.220
I could have told you that without eating the damn thing.

02:45:21.220 --> 02:45:26.220
I think even those cheeseburger hot pockets are disgusting. I don't know if you remember how one. They're gross.

02:45:26.220 --> 02:45:31.220
I enjoy a good cheeseburger and I love pizza, but that thing's gross. Avoid.

02:45:33.220 --> 02:45:38.220
Nintz says, oh, no, never mind. He's sending me messages on PSO.

02:45:38.220 --> 02:45:42.700
Jin4576 says F you to Kingston, New York cyber station

02:45:42.700 --> 02:45:46.340
your DDR EX machine is in such bad condition and you don't care

02:45:46.340 --> 02:45:50.180
the pad is on a tilt and you think that putting tiles on the bottom of the pad

02:45:50.180 --> 02:45:50.940
will fix it

02:45:50.940 --> 02:45:54.700
here's some advice get a new machine or actually try to fix the machine and not

02:45:54.700 --> 02:46:01.140
half-ass it. An illusion would like to say F you to the whole tricky business

02:46:01.140 --> 02:46:02.580
with Konami and Roxor

02:46:02.580 --> 02:46:06.460
did Roxor do something illegal? Yes. Do they deserve to be sued?

02:46:06.460 --> 02:46:09.660
Yes, but couldn't they have sued them a week after the game was released or

02:46:09.660 --> 02:46:10.220
something?

02:46:10.220 --> 02:46:14.380
Fuck whoever predicted that FU, you jerk. It wasn't Mikolatov, by the way,

02:46:14.380 --> 02:46:18.140
Ellucian. It was the guy after him. And that's it. That was the last FU.

02:46:18.140 --> 02:46:21.820
I just want to add to that, though. You do know that lawsuits

02:46:21.820 --> 02:46:26.260
aren't written overnight, right? And the rumor going around is that this thing's

02:46:26.260 --> 02:46:28.260
actually been planned for months, and it's just

02:46:28.260 --> 02:46:33.340
funny timing or something. I don't know. I like that lemon-lime jump in the chat room that says,

02:46:33.340 --> 02:46:37.020
Reject Groats Pizza. That's good.

02:46:37.020 --> 02:46:41.840
That's really good. Alright, one thing we want to tell you guys about, because we're

02:46:41.840 --> 02:46:44.860
getting towards the end of the show, we're going to do some Ask Orange Lounge real quick

02:46:44.860 --> 02:46:49.540
because we know it's kind of the E3 edition. So, send us your questions for Ask Orange

02:46:49.540 --> 02:46:53.160
Lounge right now. We're going to do a quick break then we'll come back and answer those.

02:46:53.160 --> 02:46:57.720
What we do want to say though, we have an email address set up. Oh, actually, no, I've

02:46:57.720 --> 02:47:01.360
got to make one tweak to it and then we will give you the email address. I'm just kidding.

02:47:01.360 --> 02:47:06.320
We'll give you that email address when we come back from this break. How's that sound?

02:47:06.320 --> 02:47:08.040
Yeah, I'm with it tonight.

02:47:08.040 --> 02:47:12.320
You are so there. You know, you were just so on the ball.

02:47:12.320 --> 02:47:15.720
Whatever. You were on the ball and then you fell off. We're going to take a quick two-song break.

02:47:15.720 --> 02:47:19.760
Just a quick two-song break. We'll be back with Ask Orange Lounge. Send a private

02:47:19.760 --> 02:47:23.320
message to Sky in the chat room with your Ask Orange Lounge question.

02:47:23.320 --> 02:47:27.340
And we will be back after this. Start it off with a little bit of a...

02:47:27.340 --> 02:47:30.320
I think this could be an anthem song for Jamie.

02:47:30.320 --> 02:47:32.120
it's it's bad girls

02:47:32.120 --> 02:47:34.120
way back after this

02:48:02.120 --> 02:48:04.620
Picking up those kinds of strangers

02:48:04.620 --> 02:48:06.120
It's a fight, it's a fight

02:48:06.120 --> 02:48:07.620
When you can't go

02:48:07.620 --> 02:48:09.120
It's a fight, it's a fight

02:48:10.120 --> 02:48:14.120
What you want in your life

02:48:16.120 --> 02:48:18.120
You ask yourself

02:48:20.120 --> 02:48:22.120
Who they are

02:48:24.120 --> 02:48:26.120
Like everybody else

02:48:26.120 --> 02:48:32.620
They wanna be alone

02:48:32.620 --> 02:48:36.120
Yeah

02:48:36.120 --> 02:48:40.620
Bad girl, bad girl, you're such a dirty bad girl

02:48:40.620 --> 02:48:42.120
You make me weak

02:48:42.620 --> 02:48:43.620
Uh huh

02:48:44.620 --> 02:48:48.620
You bad girl, you bad girl, you're such a dirty bad girl

02:48:48.620 --> 02:48:49.120
YEAH!

02:50:18.620 --> 02:50:25.620
Hi, this is Melby of RTF, and for an extra $1.99 a minute, my girlfriend Melby can join

02:50:41.100 --> 02:50:45.820
us on all the fun together. Hey, hey, if you're a broke-ass like I am, why don't you come

02:50:45.820 --> 02:50:50.200
in one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to and still the fun is just as great.

02:50:50.200 --> 02:50:52.700
It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights.

02:50:52.700 --> 02:50:57.020
Kick it with me and you just might realize the best things in life are free.

02:50:57.020 --> 02:51:02.260
Yes, our buddy Mel B there, what is he, a ten time freestyle champion now in DDRC?

02:51:02.260 --> 02:51:03.580
Indeed he is.

02:51:03.580 --> 02:51:07.340
By the way, and I should have said this earlier in the show because it's definitely worthy

02:51:07.340 --> 02:51:10.060
of this, but I think we're okay to talk about this now.

02:51:10.060 --> 02:51:13.180
All the T's have been crossed and I's have been dotted.

02:51:13.180 --> 02:51:18.580
Mel B. is going to be joining the Orange Lounge Radio staff, so I'm very excited about that.

02:51:18.580 --> 02:51:19.580
Welcome!

02:51:19.580 --> 02:51:20.580
Welcome!

02:51:20.580 --> 02:51:23.100
Mel B., actually though, he will not be joining now, I just want to be quick, he will not

02:51:23.100 --> 02:51:27.080
be joining the on-air staff because he can't because of where he is physically, but he

02:51:27.080 --> 02:51:33.460
will be joining our new staff on OrangeLoungeRadio.com and bringing us news and articles and observations.

02:51:33.460 --> 02:51:37.980
And unfortunately, this kind of comes at the cost of the DDR Spot, the site he used to

02:51:37.980 --> 02:51:39.620
work for, is gone.

02:51:39.620 --> 02:51:40.620
Bye-bye.

02:51:40.620 --> 02:51:43.620
So, sorry guys, DDR Spot, you've done good.

02:51:43.620 --> 02:51:45.620
I will hold onto my t-shirt forever.

02:51:45.620 --> 02:51:46.620
I will.

02:51:46.620 --> 02:51:47.620
So, um...

02:51:47.620 --> 02:51:49.620
Even though it's three sizes too big.

02:51:49.620 --> 02:51:51.620
Alright, so, um, welcome Mel.

02:51:51.620 --> 02:51:53.620
Sorry to hear about DDR Spot.

02:51:53.620 --> 02:51:56.620
We're looking forward to seeing what you have to bring to our news section.

02:51:56.620 --> 02:52:02.620
And from what I understand, Mel has got some E3 scoops he wants to share with us on the website.

02:52:02.620 --> 02:52:03.620
Oh!

02:52:03.620 --> 02:52:04.620
So we'll be seeing that.

02:52:04.620 --> 02:52:06.620
Alright, um, let's get to some Ask Orange Lounge.

02:52:06.620 --> 02:52:08.620
We only have a little bit of show left here.

02:52:08.620 --> 02:52:10.620
So let's get to some Ask Orange Lounge.

02:52:10.620 --> 02:52:14.620
A question from the chat room, will Mel be on the show later?

02:52:14.620 --> 02:52:20.620
He will be on the show as much as he can, but unfortunately since he lives like a well over a two hour drive away,

02:52:20.620 --> 02:52:23.620
it doesn't happen very often, but we do appreciate when he's here.

02:52:23.620 --> 02:52:26.620
We will have him, we'll try to get him at least on Skype a little more often.

02:52:26.620 --> 02:52:28.620
Give us some perspective.

02:52:28.620 --> 02:52:30.620
Alright, here we go.

02:52:30.620 --> 02:52:41.920
Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question. What will we find out this week on Orange

02:52:41.920 --> 02:52:48.660
Lounge Radio? Will we find out that we are so very tired because all this prepping for

02:52:48.660 --> 02:52:58.220
E3 has really stressed out? That's the most karaoke I do on this show by the way.

02:52:58.220 --> 02:53:02.120
illusion wants to know has anyone seen the movie crash yet

02:53:02.120 --> 02:53:03.020
no

02:53:03.020 --> 02:53:06.080
i have not but i want to i've heard good things about it because illusion you

02:53:06.080 --> 02:53:08.820
won't shut up when you tell me about the movie and you say it's good

02:53:08.820 --> 02:53:12.660
but actually some um... uh... i think my roommate's family or something went to

02:53:12.660 --> 02:53:15.620
go see it and they said it was very good so i want to see it and i thought the

02:53:15.620 --> 02:53:18.220
trailer and it looked good

02:53:18.220 --> 02:53:21.540
i was actually going to try and go see crash like two nights ago but it was too late

02:53:21.540 --> 02:53:26.020
like all the theaters were closed

02:53:26.020 --> 02:53:32.020
Doobs says, were you a jock quarterback giving swirlies to nerds back in high school, or

02:53:32.020 --> 02:53:35.160
an energetic cheerleader as Lemon Lime Jumps said?

02:53:35.160 --> 02:53:36.160
I was neither.

02:53:36.160 --> 02:53:37.160
I was a band geek.

02:53:37.160 --> 02:53:38.160
I was a band geek too.

02:53:38.160 --> 02:53:42.280
Not only was I a band geek, I was in yearbook and student council, so I guess that kind

02:53:42.280 --> 02:53:46.120
of makes me a cheerleader, but I was on the chess team, and on pep squad.

02:53:46.120 --> 02:53:51.880
You have to remember that my role in student council was to be the voice for the bad kids

02:53:51.880 --> 02:53:55.400
basically because I went to a very interesting high school but the high

02:53:55.400 --> 02:54:00.720
school I went to was like dominated two-thirds probably by Mormons not that

02:54:00.720 --> 02:54:03.320
there's anything wrong with that or at least I'm gonna get into on this show

02:54:03.320 --> 02:54:08.040
but um yeah I was definitely a different voice than the type of person you would

02:54:08.040 --> 02:54:12.440
typically see on the student council so it was interesting

02:54:12.440 --> 02:54:21.160
Ron Ma wants to know favorite Nintendo character and why you want to start

02:54:21.160 --> 02:54:22.660
Favorite Nintendo character?

02:54:22.660 --> 02:54:24.860
Link. He's just taught. Older Link.

02:54:24.860 --> 02:54:26.360
Older Link. Older Link from Being Hot.

02:54:26.360 --> 02:54:29.960
I would say the eggplant wizard, but not as portrayed in the cartoon.

02:54:29.960 --> 02:54:34.260
The old school 8-bit eggplant wizard was awesome because he turned people into eggplants.

02:54:34.260 --> 02:54:38.260
And when you would move around when you were Kid Icarus as the eggplant, it looks so cute.

02:54:38.260 --> 02:54:39.360
That's funny.

02:54:39.360 --> 02:54:45.060
I want the eggplant wizard so bad to come back in Melee 2.

02:54:45.060 --> 02:54:48.960
If they do Melee 2, I'm hoping that's like a surprise announcement at E3. I would die.

02:54:48.960 --> 02:54:57.760
Um, now just tell me, uh, LemonLimeJump wants to know, now just tell me liege, is that a

02:54:57.760 --> 02:54:58.760
mistype?

02:54:58.760 --> 02:54:59.760
I don't know.

02:54:59.760 --> 02:55:04.360
Just tell me, just how do we know the earth to be banana shaped?

02:55:04.360 --> 02:55:06.360
I can illustrate that with sheep letters.

02:55:06.360 --> 02:55:08.880
Is that a hitchhiker's reference?

02:55:08.880 --> 02:55:10.880
No, it's Monty Python.

02:55:10.880 --> 02:55:13.080
Oh, Monty Python.

02:55:13.080 --> 02:55:15.440
My bad.

02:55:15.440 --> 02:55:16.600
That's it.

02:55:16.600 --> 02:55:22.100
We have all the questions we got from our listeners, that wasn't a whole lot tonight,

02:55:22.100 --> 02:55:23.100
they're kind of quiet.

02:55:23.100 --> 02:55:24.100
Yeah.

02:55:24.100 --> 02:55:26.800
I was going to take that, this one poor person has been calling into the skype line like

02:55:26.800 --> 02:55:27.800
all night long.

02:55:27.800 --> 02:55:28.800
Yeah let's take it.

02:55:28.800 --> 02:55:30.800
Well I was going to take it but he's not on now.

02:55:30.800 --> 02:55:33.560
Person call, you have one minute.

02:55:33.560 --> 02:55:34.560
Maybe I should just call him.

02:55:34.560 --> 02:55:35.560
Yeah go for it.

02:55:35.560 --> 02:55:38.560
Sure why not, we'll see what happens.

02:55:38.560 --> 02:55:43.960
We'll see if he picks up.

02:55:43.960 --> 02:55:44.960
Hello?

02:55:44.960 --> 02:55:54.960
Hello? We're calling you because you've been calling us all night long and we felt bad.

02:55:54.960 --> 02:55:58.960
Please say something.

02:55:58.960 --> 02:55:59.960
Hey.

02:55:59.960 --> 02:56:01.960
Hey, you're there. Hi.

02:56:01.960 --> 02:56:02.960
This is kind of weird.

02:56:02.960 --> 02:56:03.960
Hi, who's this?

02:56:03.960 --> 02:56:07.960
RPGKing7.

02:56:07.960 --> 02:56:11.960
Hello, RPGKing7. Real quick, because we're at the end of the show. What's on your mind?

02:56:11.960 --> 02:56:16.800
Well, I was just wondering what DS games are you looking forward to

02:56:16.800 --> 02:56:20.320
to hear about about E3? Sorry, to hear from E3.

02:56:20.320 --> 02:56:25.120
DS games, Animal Crossing DS. I am all about the Animal Crossing. If they have

02:56:25.120 --> 02:56:28.200
anything on Katamari Damacy, I'd be really curious about that too, but Animal

02:56:28.200 --> 02:56:29.320
Crossing is

02:56:29.320 --> 02:56:32.600
the one I have to see. And anything that is

02:56:32.600 --> 02:56:36.800
online enabled with the DS, I would say.

02:56:36.800 --> 02:56:41.280
Animal Crossing DS will own anything, and I

02:56:41.280 --> 02:56:45.120
Bless Nintendo because they're the only company that can get away with this crap

02:56:45.120 --> 02:56:49.320
repackaging the same damn thing and putting a new bow on it

02:56:49.320 --> 02:56:53.960
and we all eat this shit up. And I am so excited about Animal Crossing DS and

02:56:53.960 --> 02:56:55.800
it's the same damn thing as before with

02:56:55.800 --> 02:56:59.320
you know a few new features. Damn you Nintendo, damn you.

02:56:59.320 --> 02:57:02.720
How about you, sir? What are you looking forward to?

02:57:02.720 --> 02:57:06.120
Castlevania DS because

02:57:06.120 --> 02:57:10.640
the first time in a while had a real sequel to a Castlevania game.

02:57:10.640 --> 02:57:16.200
I haven't picked up a DS yet, but you know, if it's good, then it'll be what I'll pick

02:57:16.200 --> 02:57:17.200
up a DS for.

02:57:17.200 --> 02:57:20.000
I didn't even think of Castlevania DS, I definitely can't wait for that one.

02:57:20.000 --> 02:57:24.240
The Konami booth is going to be so happening this year, oh my god, you guys don't even

02:57:24.240 --> 02:57:28.000
know the half of it, trust me, you don't even know the half of it, how else are we going

02:57:28.000 --> 02:57:31.880
to have that Konami booth going to be this year, so I'm excited.

02:57:31.880 --> 02:57:32.880
Anything else?

02:57:32.880 --> 02:57:35.880
Cause it's the end of the show?

02:57:35.880 --> 02:57:38.680
No just to say hi to you from up here in Canada.

02:57:38.680 --> 02:57:39.680
Well hello Canada!

02:57:39.680 --> 02:57:40.680
That's it.

02:57:40.680 --> 02:57:41.680
Alright.

02:57:41.680 --> 02:57:45.720
Don't get too cold up there, okay?

02:57:45.720 --> 02:57:46.720
We'll try not to.

02:57:46.720 --> 02:57:47.720
Alright.

02:57:47.720 --> 02:57:48.720
Thanks.

02:57:48.720 --> 02:57:49.720
Hey, it's always so cold up here.

02:57:49.720 --> 02:57:50.720
I know, I know.

02:57:50.720 --> 02:57:51.720
Those stereotypes.

02:57:51.720 --> 02:57:52.720
Gotta love them.

02:57:52.720 --> 02:57:54.960
Well, I'm just gonna walk on over to the beach as soon as we're done with the show here and,

02:57:54.960 --> 02:57:55.960
you know, run into some celebrities.

02:57:55.960 --> 02:57:59.960
Have a date with Cameron Diaz after the show.

02:57:59.960 --> 02:58:00.960
Alright.

02:58:00.960 --> 02:58:01.960
See ya.

02:58:01.960 --> 02:58:02.960
Bye.

02:58:02.960 --> 02:58:03.960
Thanks.

02:58:03.960 --> 02:58:04.960
Gotta love those stereotypes.

02:58:04.960 --> 02:58:05.960
Canadians.

02:58:05.960 --> 02:58:07.520
Always say aboot and live in igloos.

02:58:07.520 --> 02:58:08.520
And um...

02:58:08.520 --> 02:58:09.520
That's...

02:58:09.520 --> 02:58:10.520
That's Eskimos.

02:58:10.520 --> 02:58:11.520
Or Alaska.

02:58:11.520 --> 02:58:12.520
People in Alaska.

02:58:12.520 --> 02:58:16.520
Canadians, they always say aboot and have the flappy heads, just like in South Park.

02:58:16.520 --> 02:58:19.940
And then us here, we all have blonde hair and blue eyes.

02:58:19.940 --> 02:58:23.960
And if you've seen our pictures before, because they used to be on the website a long time

02:58:23.960 --> 02:58:28.640
ago, but if you've seen our pictures before, yeah, we all have blonde hair and blue eyes.

02:58:28.640 --> 02:58:29.640
You're right.

02:58:29.640 --> 02:58:30.640
Good thing I'm not from California.

02:58:30.640 --> 02:58:31.640
All right.

02:58:31.640 --> 02:58:35.520
But it automatically happens when you pass, when you get your driver's license.

02:58:35.520 --> 02:58:39.160
yeah it's like this it's this process they make you go through actually

02:58:39.160 --> 02:58:46.040
Jamie your final thought for tonight

02:58:46.040 --> 02:58:50.040
I'm

02:58:50.040 --> 02:58:53.880
money

02:58:53.880 --> 02:58:58.360
I'm sorry I have one thing real quick okay on if you want to send us an email

02:58:58.360 --> 02:59:02.760
if you want to send us an email and ask us a question about E3

02:59:02.760 --> 02:59:06.280
you have something specific you want us to find at the show

02:59:06.280 --> 02:59:09.720
what you have to do is send an email to

02:59:09.720 --> 02:59:14.120
E3 at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

02:59:14.120 --> 02:59:17.440
you gotta wait about two minutes, don't send it just yet because I'm actually creating

02:59:17.440 --> 02:59:18.680
the account like as we speak

02:59:18.680 --> 02:59:21.960
send an email to E3 at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

02:59:21.960 --> 02:59:25.640
this is the email we're going to be checking at E3 and answering the questions on our

02:59:25.640 --> 02:59:29.060
podcast, so if you have anything you want to ask kind of like in advance or anything

02:59:29.060 --> 02:59:32.560
send it over email, send it in a couple minutes

02:59:32.560 --> 02:59:36.820
and we will be reading those emails at E3 and getting responses to you via our

02:59:36.820 --> 02:59:37.600
podcast.

02:59:37.600 --> 02:59:40.960
So you can kind of live vicariously through us in that sense.

02:59:40.960 --> 02:59:44.840
That should be very cool. Alright now, sorry Darksucker, your final thought.

02:59:44.840 --> 02:59:51.340
Um, I learn minidisc player and reject fun psychons.

02:59:51.340 --> 02:59:54.880
My final thought is, um,

02:59:54.880 --> 02:59:58.640
you know this whole thing is that happened with the lawsuit and

02:59:58.640 --> 03:00:01.240
everything, it's all about protecting

03:00:01.240 --> 03:00:05.040
what is, you know, Konami and it's protecting Konami's patents

03:00:05.040 --> 03:00:08.560
and it's all about, you know, what Konami, you know, came up with and

03:00:08.560 --> 03:00:12.000
everything and people infringing on that.

03:00:12.000 --> 03:00:13.600
Very interesting

03:00:13.600 --> 03:00:15.560
the kinds of things that, you know,

03:00:15.560 --> 03:00:18.800
were patented in this whole thing. Very interesting. It would be very interesting seeing like all the

03:00:18.800 --> 03:00:21.240
different things that Konami's patented.

03:00:21.240 --> 03:00:23.960
In regards to DDR, of course.

03:00:23.960 --> 03:00:25.080
Alright, that's it.

03:00:25.080 --> 03:00:29.120
Have a good one, you guys. Final word of the show. I guess since it's just me and you,

03:00:29.120 --> 03:00:36.120
I'll give it to you, because I don't want it.

03:00:38.200 --> 03:00:43.760

03:01:02.340 --> 03:01:09.840
Oh, mmm, I ought to say, don't look for all of your happiness in just one place.

03:01:09.840 --> 03:01:15.840
Yeah, I mean, it's okay to ask the big questions in life. Just don't expect any answers.

03:01:15.840 --> 03:01:18.840
Uh, yeah, yeah, uh, uh, don't take it all too...

03:01:18.840 --> 03:01:21.840
No, wait a minute. You should always think I...

03:01:21.840 --> 03:01:33.840
No, that's wrong. No, actually, I don't think I've learned anything, and that is a lesson in itself.

03:01:33.840 --> 03:01:39.880
