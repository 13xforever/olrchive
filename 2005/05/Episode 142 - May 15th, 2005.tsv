60922	77494	The following live program is a special presentation of Orange Lounge Radio.
79475	83438	Well, you know, typically this week would be the calm before the storm.
83838	88922	Very quiet week before E3, when all the companies would announce their new stuff.
89932	91853	But boy, we didn't luck out that way this week.
91913	97536	I thought I'd be able to nap through tonight's show, but did things just explode this week or what?
102439	105561	Just mass hysteria throughout the Bomani community this week.
105601	109463	If you've been living under a rock somewhere, I guess we'll have to explain it to you.
109823	111084	And it's not just one thing.
111124	114686	I realize one thing has been dominating the news this week, but there's more to it than that.
116129	117689	And I think that's going to be the running theme tonight.
117709	119290	There's more to it than it seems.
119630	121571	I think the other thing is, I told you.
123491	124591	But did you let me know?
124752	126212	So there's two themes tonight.
127072	130613	Look closer than it seems, and Jamie told you so.
130633	131734	Exactly.
133794	135455	Orange Lounge, episode 142, right after this.
151927	157328	Orange Lounge Radio is presented in the TMI sound format.

294655	295796	Hi, everyone!
298218	299479	You're very perky tonight.
299979	301040	I'm such a faker.
301140	303081	As opposed to the fucking bitch you were last week.
303522	304082	Just kidding.
307125	308326	I just wanted that reaction.
311363	312744	Aw, I love you.
312824	314566	Aw, I love you.
314626	315267	You know I love you.
315727	316307	I loved you.
317689	318349	I loved you.
318589	318830	What?
319110	319350	What?
319430	319811	What?
319831	319971	What?
319991	320131	What?
320151	320271	What?
320291	320431	What?
320451	320591	What?
320611	321672	What?
321972	322513	What?
323834	325195	Look, it's a three-hour show, lady.
325215	327157	We got a lot to talk about tonight.
327657	327918	All right.
328598	331241	Tech Master Loki on vacation tonight, actually.
332642	338347	From what I understand, the woman is making him put out tonight so that he can attend E3 next week.
340430	341410	or something like that.
342051	346293	I think it's actually not as crude as I put it, but you know.
346613	351715	I think she'd be thanking us for taking him off her hands for a while.
351795	352555	Just kidding.
352575	355417	The politically correct version of that story doesn't equal as good ratings.
355737	362900	So what's very interesting about tonight's show is that it's just DarkSakura and I. There are no special guests here.
362920	363720	Flashback!
363980	367462	As of yet, do we still have the folks coming that you were mentioning earlier?
368007	368867	I don't know.
368927	369908	I don't have a confirmation.
369968	370548	Okay, we don't know.
370668	372609	I didn't want to go eat at a buffet at the casino.
372629	374109	Oh, that's a good place.
374149	374489	So anyway.
374989	377050	So it's just going to be DarkSakura and I tonight, feeling the love.
377570	382532	Which kind of works out because I know everybody and their mom wants to get on the Skype line tonight.
384072	387173	Because of some news story that was going on.
387273	389774	Something about... Something about like...
390754	391735	A jaw suit?
391895	392655	Or a raw suit?
392755	393156	I don't know.
393276	393896	Something like that.
394477	395137	Raw suit!
396178	396938	Raw suit up!
397979	401842	This is going to be an interesting show tonight.
401862	405384	So definitely check out our Skype line, www.orangelaunchradio.com.
405404	406625	Click on Interact with us.
407746	415371	And we'll be back after a quick break to talk about many things going on this week, including, you know... That.
415752	416052	That.
416072	416152	That.
417870	420011	of which we say, you got served.
420532	420932	Literally.
421873	423354	Bitch, I told you so.
424454	425475	Alright, we'll be back after this.
425515	427336	In this break, some potpourri.
428037	428617	Some potpourri.
428998	430298	In frilly pastel colors.
430338	436222	And in fact, we're going to have Bimani coexisting with some like one or two in the groove songs.
436483	438164	The way some people would like to see it.
439184	439665	But we'll see.
439685	442126	Can't we all just get along?
442146	443447	We'll find out.
444128	445228	We'll be back after this.
445629	446129	Starting off
446530	453168	from Keyboard Mania, Sensation I'm feeling a sensation and I gotta go clean up so we'll be back after this
555189	555430	Thank you.
656928	657149	Thank you.
747839	748843	My name is Susha.
749345	750208	I give you my kiss.
871483	875804	Orange Lounge Radio is proud to present a celebrity interview.
876664	878325	Can you introduce yourself for our listeners?
878785	879605	I'm Miss Cleo.
880145	881745	Oh, it's great to have you on the show today.
882085	883226	Hello, how are you today?
883726	884666	I'm great, thanks.
884846	885866	Did you have a question?
886286	892207	Well, yes, actually I wanted to know... Can I please have your first name only and your birth date, please?
893328	897929	Uh, well, no, I actually just wanted to know what you thought of Orange Lounge Radio.
898189	899009	Alright, go ahead.
899417	902599	Well, what do you think of Loki, one of the three hosts of Orange Lounge Radio?
902939	903839	Is he incarcerated?
904459	905820	Uh, actually, no, he's not.
905880	908121	But what do you think of the ever-ranty DarkSakura?
908281	909562	Hi, dear, how are you?
910142	910862	I love you.
911103	912603	I see you two must know each other.
912703	914004	Well, what do you think of Skye?
914304	916225	Did he used to play football when he was in high school?
916485	917926	Well, actually, no, he didn't.
919146	921007	Well, what do you think of Intern Zero?
921447	924769	I want you to really remember the pill, all right?
925319	927279	I'm seeing some forgetting, possibly.
927579	930520	And I'm seeing a new baby in the next three months.
931240	931660	Right.
931960	934881	Okay, well, thanks for being on Orange Lounge Radio today.
935021	940062	Um, I don't mean to sidetrack your question here, but who are all of these nosy people?
940322	943642	Outside influences I'm seeing around you by the moon card.
943822	944762	Get away from me.
947283	952104	Orange Lounge Radio, helping to free your mind and spirit.
952584	953404	I'm Miss Cleo.
953764	954444	I love you.
957597	958157	I love you.
988273	988653	Thank you.
991115	997799	So, the only thing that's keeping us sane tonight is just acting a little crazy, so you'll have to excuse... I don't know about you.
998799	999680	Listen, barnyard.
1001541	1005103	I don't know if it's just me, but I've been kind of like in a weird funk all week.
1007684	1009225	Why don't I just talk to myself tonight?
1009865	1010746	Sorry.
1011887	1014208	No, well, I don't blame you.
1015718	1024464	I don't know, tonight is supposed to be the show, we're packing during the show, the Survivor finale's on and I'm having to miss it.
1024885	1026566	You reality TV whore.
1026586	1032931	I know, and don't freaking spoil it for me in the chat room, I swear to God that'll be like an instant ban for life if you spoil it for me.
1033151	1034332	Everybody die!
1034952	1035612	Yeah, everybody die.
1035652	1036333	Hurricane!
1036713	1037334	That's how it ends.
1038775	1039755	You need to televise it too.
1040676	1041777	And then Loki's not even here.
1042809	1044851	I have enough anger for this show.
1044871	1045251	Petite love.
1045271	1046632	We want ice cream.
1046672	1047393	We have to acknowledge it.
1047613	1048213	We just... We...
1072921	1078023	It was supposed to be that everything is quiet the week before E3, and now just the shit hit the fan.
1078423	1078903	Seriously.
1079303	1079904	In so many ways.
1080864	1083265	The shit hitting the fan had excellent timing.
1084985	1085285	Anyway.
1086526	1090407	Let's talk about How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day?
1090447	1091828	We always do start off the show this way.
1092148	1094388	I was a little worried about doing How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day?
1094428	1098510	Because usually we have a studio full of like ten people, and we would have never gotten to the lawsuit stuff.
1098810	1100731	But since it's just you and I, I suppose we have the time.
1100791	1101831	So, How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day?
1102529	1106430	Now, first of all, to be grammatically correct, that would be you and me.
1108771	1109232	Whatever.
1110652	1112393	Actually, that is one of my grammatical pet peeves.
1113133	1114634	But everybody does it somewhere.
1116154	1121696	Okay, my week has been homework, homework, homework, homework, and homework.
1121736	1123657	I've been doing two weeks of homework in one week.
1124797	1129259	Um, I finished... What the fuck did I do?
1130860	1131620	I did, um...
1133951	1136433	My color harmony painting, I finished that.
1136574	1137014	Turned it in.
1137434	1137795	Gotta be.
1140697	1141278	Excuse me.
1141338	1141678	Thank you.
1142419	1143480	I burped off camera.
1143500	1147984	What the hell are you talking about?
1148004	1149686	I cut out a bunch of pictures for my montage.
1149726	1150707	I still have a few more to do.
1153009	1154150	Which is my final on Monday.
1154570	1157733	I got to do fan art as my digital illustration.
1157813	1158694	How cool is that?
1159881	1164644	I was up until 5am writing a tutorial on how to make live journal icons in PaintShop Pro.
1165585	1167226	My tutorial looks pretty damn good, by the way.
1170689	1173771	Had Adventures at Target at closing time.
1175652	1181756	I went to Rapture on Thursday, which was very fun.
1181856	1183157	Rapture.
1183838	1185579	Not in the blondie sense, this is in the...
1186130	1189932	Hi, let's all wear black and listen to industrial music and get very drunk.
1190632	1191352	It was really fun.
1191392	1191972	I had a good time.
1195014	1197415	I drank whiskey for the first time in like a year.
1197695	1198235	It was good.
1199515	1200116	And Guinness.
1200736	1201696	Guinness and whiskey.
1202457	1203337	Makes me happy, girl.
1207939	1210300	It's just been getting ready for E3, really.
1211220	1214161	Getting stuff together, getting crap off my laptop.
1214862	1215722	Went to Fry's today.
1216664	1217764	I bought Pulp Fiction on DVD today
1244271	1252175	It was $14 for the special edition, but I already had it on Laserdisc, the four disc set.
1252555	1256577	Yes, I have and watch Laserdiscs, and our Laserdisc player still works.
1257938	1267563	Oh yeah, and I went to, not Fry's, but to Dimple Records, it's one of the local resale places, you know, used records and stuff.
1268344	1272986	And yeah, records are those big discs that are hiding in your parents' garage.
1273979	1275300	Don't Copy That Floppy
1298004	1298764	I don't remember.
1298784	1301786	I can't even remember our own shows inside jokes.
1301906	1304227	Do not copy the CD!
1304607	1306829	You'll go to hell if you do!
1308149	1310791	The reference I'm making, of course, is to an old Captain Jack CD.
1310851	1311991	I'm going to have to find this now.
1314172	1315693	Which, of course, is funny since you have it copied.
1316854	1317354	Yeah, exactly.
1317394	1319415	That is irony.
1319495	1324538	I also spent the week downloading a bunch of Radiohead and The Bees.
1325387	1329628	and Super Furry Animals, which everybody got to hear at the beginning of my show on Tuesday.
1329968	1334569	By the way, of course, no show on Tuesday because I will be in a car.
1336089	1336910	Sorry, can't do that.
1339390	1340410	Can I interrupt for one sec?
1340470	1340630	No.
1341070	1341331	Please?
1341411	1341651	Okay.
1343631	1352593	Hey folks, this was CG Radio presenting you Captain Jack's Greatest Summer Hits.
1353251	1381868	Keep the spirit, the sun is shining wherever you are And don't forget, copy kills music So, don't copy, buy our records Bye-bye, the party never ends Copy kills music Thank you, Captain Jack Ow, music dead Copied Ironically, that was copied from the original album I can't think of anything else, so I'm just not going to say anything
1382307	1383789	I'm going to caress the ferret.
1386632	1394740	By the way, you need to figure out which ferret is being sacrificed to the giant Katamari at E3, because one of them will be stuck on the Katamari at E3.
1396322	1396882	Get over it.
1398644	1399685	For those of you guys that haven't heard...
1400680	1401421	E3 Catamari Ball X-Rated Clothing
1423729	1425915	Aferit onto the Katamari at E3.
1425935	1427519	We'll take a picture and of course post it on the net.
1427539	1428802	We should put business cards on there too.
1429443	1431569	And I'm putting Reject False Icon stickers on there.
1432170	1435211	And we might put one of our media handouts on there as well.
1435251	1437372	We're set for E3 this year.
1438252	1444774	DarkSakura has twice the business cards she had last year, because she was the only one of us to give away all her business cards by the end of the second day.
1444894	1446254	And I gave away some of yours.
1446294	1449555	Yeah, and she started giving away mine, and I only had like five left.
1449915	1452876	So Jamie now has twice as many cards at least this year.
1452956	1454216	And you know I whore us out.
1454376	1456277	Oh yeah, so I'm excited about that.
1457344	1460566	Anyway, sorry, um, my week and my day.
1460786	1464088	I played a lot of PSO Blue Burst, because that's in beta right now.
1464128	1464988	I played that too.
1465028	1466629	And that makes it, yeah, we all played.
1466709	1470331	Me, you, Miklatov, and one of your friends from the Gorillas boards, right?
1470451	1471012	We were all playing.
1471372	1474994	Yeah, um, well, my character is like super gothy for a while.
1476335	1479336	Ooh, sorry, I just, I really like this thought from the chat room.
1479456	1482298	MPQ is asking, put Ultra Kate on the Katamari.
1483151	1483893	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1494971	1496052	You know what I wanted to do?
1496192	1496433	What?
1496793	1505400	If I have one of those little PDF files of the Prince cutouts, if I can take my X-Acto knife to it, if someone can put it together, we can actually stick the Prince on there.
1505640	1507721	Let's install Linux on the Katamari.
1508062	1508682	Yeah!
1509163	1511144	We should put like a big Linux penguin on it.
1511164	1513486	Or as Petra said, put NetBSD.
1513806	1519491	But I think Linux is really the one that, you know... We should put the Linux penguin on it.
1520191	1520452	Maybe.
1520532	1522093	Hey, chatroom, okay, chatroom.
1523477	1528761	Um, go ahead and PM me with suggestions for what should go on the Katamari.
1529402	1531023	And we'll, uh, we'll, uh...
1532148	1533569	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1558363	1561264	We have an email address set up so you can send us questions.
1561644	1571568	If you want us to be the investigative reporters and go investigate a game for you and find out some details and bring back or you just have a question about E3 in general or you want a picture with something, I don't know.
1572068	1576470	You're going to send us an email and then we will do that and give you the answer on the podcast.
1576710	1578031	Kalamari on the Katamari.
1579791	1580051	Anyway.
1582172	1584453	We should do a list list tonight even though it's just us.
1585205	1585665	Just us?
1585825	1587466	We could have my roommate participate.
1587487	1589268	Do you want to participate in the listless tonight?
1590268	1592590	My roommate has no idea what he's in for.
1593430	1593751	Yes.
1594151	1595011	Okay.
1595031	1595372	Cool.
1595392	1596572	Well, then we'll have to think of something.
1596772	1599414	But you have to remember... We need to do things to put on the Katamari.
1599534	1602996	Chris, well, see, but Chris, do you even know what Katamari Damashii is, Chris?
1603016	1604037	Um, yeah.
1604057	1604517	Oh, he does know.
1604858	1605378	Okay, he does know.
1606030	1606490	I do know.
1606730	1609572	Okay, so then maybe we can do that as a listless later tonight.
1609993	1611093	We'll get somebody on Skype, too.
1611133	1612294	In fact, I already have somebody of mine.
1612314	1614075	We'll get a special guest on Skype.
1614795	1615616	We can do this.
1615736	1621079	Who needs that angry person with his spiky hair and trench coat?
1621800	1622901	He's probably getting laid right now.
1625002	1625222	Okay.
1626380	1627640	Crickets, Crickets, Tricks, Tricks
1655703	1662705	But you also took my class ring, which was in a front compartment in the car, and then a Commodore 64 monitor, which I don't know why it was in the backseat.
1662785	1663506	It just was, okay?
1663566	1663986	Just shut up.
1665026	1668908	So, yeah, my car barcode got broken into.
1668948	1669368	That sucks.
1669608	1677130	You know what else sucks is calling the police department to file the report, and then you ask them, have you heard of any others, any other break-ins in the area last night?
1677150	1678651	And they go, well, you know...
1680683	1686648	We're really understaffed right now and I haven't gotten to the messages from last night yet because we're all volunteers here and I'm the only one here.
1687028	1691612	And I'm just like, I feel safe here in lovely California.
1691632	1693174	Especially for a complex of this size.
1694955	1695616	No, it's the city.
1695656	1697037	It was the city's police department.
1698298	1700480	The city is staffed by volunteers.
1701441	1702362	That's retarded.
1705544	1706045	I'm going to cry.
1707048	1711390	So, by the way, if Orange Launch Radio, if we get shot or something and we die, you'll know why.
1711771	1713492	Because the police is staffed by volunteers.
1713832	1717954	Send all angry letters to Sacramento City PD, blah blah blah, blah blah blah.
1719795	1722697	Anyway, that's my week and my day, pretty much.
1723737	1724678	How was your week and your day?
1725718	1726139	Okay, great.
1726859	1729140	Let's talk about the big news this week.
1729480	1731561	Huge news, let's just get into it.
1731601	1734283	I know a lot of you guys are tuning in tonight because you want to hear our thoughts on it.
1734955	1741716	In case you've been living under a rock or something, I'm going to play for you guys our first news break.
1741756	1746677	We actually did a news break earlier this week because we actually had some new news.
1747938	1749858	So, let's see if I can find it.
1752118	1753459	I'm well prepared for this right now.
1754679	1755499	Give me just a minute, guys.
1760960	1762300	We apologize for this technical break.
1763041	1764041	I don't, but Rob does.
1764261	1764621	Damn it.
1765965	1767026	I'm all embarrassed and stuff.
1767166	1768667	I thought I had that file ready to go.
1769708	1770088	There it is.
1770168	1770688	All right, here we go.
1770708	1771509	The spirit laughed at you.
1771549	1776472	Here was the news break, our very first Orange Lounge Radio news break from earlier this week that tells the story of what's been going on.
1777893	1780214	Orange Lounge Radio news break.
1781615	1784657	Sky here with an Orange Lounge Radio news update for this May 11, 2005.
1786542	1797777	Orange Lounge Radio has learned that Konami of Japan has filed an injunction against Roxor Games, claiming trademark and patent infringement against Dance Dance Revolution with Roxor's own game, In the Groove.
1798237	1800901	In a press release posted on Konami of Japan's website...
1801206	1801946	Yada, yada, yada, yada.
1802066	1803126	Plug for the website.
1803166	1804787	You're obviously already there.
1804847	1804887	So...
1828430	1837956	That was the first bit of news that came out, is that Konami of Japan put that press release on their site that says, you know, we've finally discovered that there's this game in the U.S.
1839698	1842880	that might be kind of infringing on some of our rights here.
1843440	1845081	At that point, I fell out of my chair.
1846142	1846882	Laughing or what?
1846923	1848444	Laughing my ass off.
1848744	1849024	Okay.
1850799	1857005	But I want to get your clear thoughts later, because you're not really an in-the-groove hater, because you were just here last week saying, it's not that bad.
1857205	1857465	Yeah.
1857525	1857726	Right?
1858366	1859527	But I was still laughing my ass off.
1859707	1861089	Yeah.
1862570	1876163	And then a little later in the day, actually, what happened over on DDR Freak is that Cutris, one of the admins over there, actually dug up, like, all smoke and gun style, managed to dig up the actual copy of
1877356	1881439	Actual copy, like you would see on thesmokinggun.com when celebrities get busted and stuff.
1881859	1884021	You dug up the actual copy of the injunction.
1884961	1885562	That's cool.
1885662	1888304	Now I could sit here and read the whole damn thing, but it's boring as hell.
1888804	1889905	I read it over on DDR Freak.
1889985	1890485	And what did you think?
1891226	1900072	You know, well, being that I did just get out of the business class last semester, a lot of it, you know, see, this is everything that I had pointed out.
1900672	1904175	They are using freaking DDR cabinets, which are a patent of Konami.
1905383	1908225	They had no legal precedent to use it.
1908945	1921853	The thing is that I think where Konami is getting the big issue from this is that with all those other little two bit ones, they're not going to make a whole bunch of money on it.
1921873	1923374	They're not trying to mass market it.
1923454	1927096	I think it's at the point that Endergroove is trying to go to the home market.
1928138	1930960	I think you're hitting on a big thing here, because I know a lot of what I've been reading.
1930980	1933222	And this news just exploded on the internet.
1933262	1937185	I mean, god, the DDR Freak thread hit like 300 posts in a day.
1937205	1937926	It was insane.
1939367	1940128	They're lit up.
1940248	1940888	The boards are lit up.
1941149	1943410	And people are going, go Konami, go!
1943490	1947714	And then people are saying, you know, fuck Konami for killing in the groove.
1947754	1949515	And people are saying, boycott Konami!
1949555	1951277	And people are saying, boycott the boycotters!
1951357	1953538	And it's just very polarizing.
1953678	1954439	I boycott you!
1954859	1955120	Yeah.
1955400	1955540	Yeah.
1955871	1957273	So I decided to boycott the thread.
1957333	1959155	No, actually I didn't.
1959275	1961218	It's like my soap opera.
1961258	1962479	I've been checking it every day.
1962799	1965843	Every day, religiously, like every hour on the hour for updates.
1966164	1967826	Next on As the Arrow Flies.
1967966	1971570	I mean, as Jamie said earlier in the show, I'm a reality TV whore.
1971690	1972752	This is as good as it gets.
1973673	1975455	Which company is going to get voted off the planet?
1976038	1995778	Well, the thing that I really liked is that when they were speaking of the cabinet, they pulled up the full schematics of the damn cabinet and outlined each point and how each point is particular specifically to an EDR machine, which is why I think that there wasn't an issue with the pump-it-up machines because they were different enough to bypass EDR.
1996445	1997245	Here's the interesting thing.
1997285	2000266	You've brought up a couple points I really want to emphasize because I feel very similar.
2000406	2007548	A lot of people, when this news first came out, said, STFU, before the documents came out, people were saying, shut the F up.
2007928	2009828	This has nothing to do with the home version.
2009868	2012869	The home version release will not be affected by this.
2013149	2023391	This is strictly about the arcade, and this is only going to affect In the Groove arcade cabinets, and it will have nothing to do with In the Groove 2 because this is all about In the Groove 1.
2024932	2025432	I say wrong.
2025836	2028718	I'd say this has everything to do with the home version.
2028938	2033180	Because they're putting this out right before they're getting the releases done.
2033200	2035101	The timing is crazy.
2035542	2043546	I mean, really, at first, the timing of this almost makes it look like Konami has Rockstar by the balls right now, basically, with the In the Groove home release coming out.
2043566	2046268	Poor Red Octane, really, who kind of is caught in the middle of this now.
2046688	2051311	Nowhere named in the lawsuit, but, you know, all this money invested in a last-bush premiere party.
2051691	2051891	Oh, yeah.
2053143	2057345	So they've got Rockstar by the balls right now, just before E3 when this is supposed to be unveiled.
2058285	2065048	Obviously, probably what they're trying to do is get this to settle out of court, which I can say with probably 98% certainty will probably happen.
2065528	2067448	I can't honestly see this going to court.
2067749	2072670	I'm wondering, though, with such a small company, Rockstar's basically just getting off the ground.
2073551	2080794	Where are they going to get the kind of money to... They have that other game, Tux Racer or something, but who'd have heard of that before this?
2081254	2081294	No.
2082304	2084346	Like I said, just getting off the ground.
2086608	2094995	The other thing, you know, is that they could be sitting on perhaps, you know... And this is speculation.
2095075	2100359	I've been trying to think of all kinds of things that might be the background motive.
2100599	2105603	Because basically, Konami of America is pulled out of the arcade market as far as EDR is concerned.
2106044	2107385	It doesn't necessarily mean...
2108055	2114400	that the powers that be at the main place in Japan might not be thinking, hey, we can market over there too.
2116622	2118583	What do you think about this argument that's coming from a lot?
2118644	2126670	And I'm kind of trying hard not to take sides here because I respect what In The Groove tried to do.
2127290	2134136	It tried to revive a dying arcade dance scene and it was put together by fans.
2135317	2135517	But
2136507	2137809	So I respect the game for that.
2137929	2141672	And even though I've said negative things about the game before, I've also said positive things about the game.
2141692	2144134	And I've always said In the Groove is a great first release.
2144575	2148298	It's not as bad as the haters say, but it's not as good as the people who lavish praise upon it say.
2148318	2150340	There's room for improvement, but they have some great ideas.
2150800	2151621	Opinions are opinions.
2151661	2152241	Yeah, exactly.
2152522	2153582	And I respect what they're doing.
2154243	2156865	But this honestly doesn't come as any surprise to me.
2157106	2163051	I think, unfortunately, I can't say so much about the staff, the folks there.
2164707	2166528	But at least the community has been very arrogant.
2168169	2170430	Very arrogant ever since the release of In the Groove.
2170710	2172871	You know, people have asked, is this legal?
2173291	2174232	And people say, yes it is.
2174252	2174892	Shut the fuck up.
2174972	2175252	Lock.
2175412	2176913	That has put me off.
2177549	2193658	much more than the game itself that attitude put me off so bad and that's why I can't help but kind of grin a little bit that this is happening and I'm sorry and I apologize to the folks that have worked so hard on this game but that arrogance that such ass arrogance
2194451	2199394	To see that get called out to the bike racks three o'clock after school is satisfying.
2199734	2204876	I want to be quoted on this on every last single in the groove board that those assholes post on.
2205477	2207318	I fucking term all of you.
2207578	2209999	Well, you're not the only one that told me this would happen.
2210599	2212700	I know, but I have ego, okay?
2213140	2213861	I told you!
2216542	2223948	And you can stick your nose up in the air as much as you want to, but it's going to be shaved off by the low-flying airplane that is Konami.
2225029	2226630	We can say I told you so on a million things.
2226930	2236037	Now, I know I said, at least a couple months ago on the show, when Red Octane first announced they were going to publish in the groove for home, I said, Konami's going to notice.
2236718	2238159	Didn't I say something like that?
2238179	2241221	I said, if Konami's going to make a move, now's the time.
2241502	2242903	Because in the groove is now...
2243592	2245153	Steppin' on Konami's turf.
2245533	2254356	Konami, obviously, even though people say Konami does shit for their fans, they do shit for DDR, that's a load of crap.
2254636	2263779	When you consider that there are three DDR games, not one, not two, three, more games than we've ever seen at E3 are going to be shown next week.
2265099	2270721	I can name a person who has worked his ass off for all of the US fans of DDR.
2271301	2274423	You know, I honestly have to give big kudos to Jason Enos.
2274523	2274803	Absolutely.
2274823	2281847	Without him, we would still be paying, you know, 70 bucks to import the damn game and 80 bucks per dance pad.
2282688	2285349	And instead, now we get unique mixes.
2285710	2288871	Japanese players are importing our mixes.
2289272	2289672	Absolutely.
2290012	2291213	Now it's the other way around.
2291293	2298177	And really, Festival, it's some, you know, this is debatable, but Festival in some ways was a copy of Ultramix, which was made here.
2298577	2298837	Yeah.
2300038	2300298	Anyway.
2300863	2302345	Now the market belongs to us.
2302505	2304348	I say bullshit.
2304388	2306210	Konami doesn't care about their American audience.
2306691	2310616	Now, okay, granted you've got the arcade scene, and yes, the arcade scene was hurting.
2311124	2312285	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2333877	2344007	But, somebody phrased it this way on a web board or something, and it does make sense, is that if Konami and Andomero settled out of court, neither one has to say what the terms of that settlement were.
2344468	2349393	Although, I'll tell you what, and so maybe, maybe, maybe that was part of the settlement.
2349853	2350754	But we don't know for sure.
2351715	2357761	And it really, it looks like Konami got the better end of the deal, because if you look at the press release on Konami's site, now granted it's spun by Konami...
2358858	2360939	It says that Andamiro actually ended up paying them.
2361340	2365483	So I find it very hard to believe that it's Andamiro keeping Konami out of the U.S.
2365563	2366224	arcade market.
2366304	2367685	I think it's just the fact that the U.S.
2367745	2370448	arcade market kind of stinks right now.
2370828	2373310	Well, on top of that, they closed down their arcade division.
2373630	2376953	Yeah, but they still have put out silent scopes and stuff.
2376993	2380176	If they really wanted to do it, they could, but it would have to be something where
2382234	2383715	I don't know, the cost has to be justified.
2383815	2387037	And I've said this on an earlier show, and I still stick by this.
2387517	2404109	I think the reason why you see Xtreme in arcades, and Konami kind of turns its back on it, even though it's not supposed to be in the US, I think the reason why you see it in the arcades is because, hey, licensing music in the US is a whole lot more difficult than it is in Japan.
2405584	2407205	The folks in Japan don't care.
2407265	2416353	You've got all these bands, Captain Jack, for the more recent games, with all the folks on Dance Mania, Wildside, whatever, that would never have been heard in the U.S.
2416393	2417433	if it wasn't for DDR.
2417794	2419215	So none of them care.
2419395	2422378	They had that big agreement with Toshiba EMI.
2423078	2423859	Exactly.
2423959	2431225	And so I think Konami kind of turns its back because it's cheaper to just let folks bring it over here and then make money off the home releases.
2433199	2434400	All that is, is publicity.
2434861	2436842	And they were going to be imported anyway.
2436862	2437823	That's how I see it.
2437903	2440285	That's also a very interesting point you bring up, is about the publicity.
2440325	2447351	Because people say, well if Konami doesn't give a shit about the arcade machines anymore, then why is this such a big deal?
2447732	2449133	Publicity is the big thing.
2449213	2461123	Because if you consider that what Indigroove was in its first release, what Indigroove was, was a conversion kit that would allow you to change a DDR machine into an Indigroove machine.
2461812	2470975	Theoretically, what they would want to do, you have to admit, this is a goal of RockSource in the end, is that they want every DDR machine changed into an in-the-groove machine.
2471095	2475236	Thusly, DDR has no exposure and no presence in the arcades anymore.
2475636	2478597	Thusly, there's no free advertising for the home releases.
2479318	2479938	And you know what?
2480078	2484139	Even though DDR Extreme is two years old, people still play it all the time.
2484179	2486780	It is still huge exposure for Konami.
2488858	2498827	Basically, this is the equivalent of saying that you're wearing a t-shirt that advertises one thing.
2499327	2501970	This is the equivalent of Rockstar coming up and spray painting the t-shirt.
2501990	2504171	So you can't see the logo.
2505012	2505733	And a lot of people...
2506178	2507539	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2529949	2533534	Yeah, I was going to say something about In The Groove and the community and what people say.
2533874	2537539	In The Groove community, you should all pile together and give me a dollar each.
2539581	2540623	Damn, I lost my train of thought.
2541143	2541544	Derail!
2543880	2545481	Let's look over some key quotes.
2563035	2575139	Quote, according to instructions provided with Defendants in the game Groove Kits, the purchaser is instructed to remove the original main circuit board from the DDR game and replace it with Defendants in the Groove game circuit board.
2575639	2579820	So that's one of the big things they're hitting on, of course, is the fact that, and people were kind of wondering...
2581863	2584184	How's Konami going to get Rockstar on this?
2584204	2585584	And then it came down to the hardware thing.
2585964	2590666	And I think hardware versus software is a huge issue here.
2591266	2595648	Because I know we had the in-the-groove scene always going, it's legal, it's legal, it's legal.
2596308	2600749	Unfortunately, I think they were more concerned with the software end of it.
2601529	2605771	And the software part of it probably is legal, because you'd barely see it mentioned in the lawsuit.
2605811	2607812	But the hardware part of it... Whoops.
2608812	2608972	So...
2609605	2610206	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2623593	2632357	Defendant provides materials bearing its own name and or trademarks to purchasers of the In the Groove game to be placed over the plaintiff's marks and other identifying material on the DDR game.
2632797	2638520	On information and belief, purchasers fail to cover plaintiff's marks and or other identifying material in all instances.
2638980	2645803	The In the Groove game, as refitted by purchasers, therefore displays both plaintiff's marks and defendant's name and or trademarks.
2647284	2650005	And a lot of people say in the scene here, they say...
2651889	2654390	How can you confuse DDR and In The Groove?
2654470	2655530	They're so different.
2656090	2659151	And to which I say, it's not all about you.
2660971	2662671	We are a small part.
2662771	2663912	We're a loyal part.
2663952	2664952	We're an essential part.
2664992	2668233	But we're a small part of the dance game music scene.
2668273	2668893	We really are.
2670213	2676674	As I was talking about last week, when we were talking about Oops I Did It Again being on DDR Extreme 2, the reason why that's there is not for you.
2676714	2678915	It's for the 10-year-old girls having slumber parties.
2679475	2679675	Yep.
2680712	2690074	So it is the normal person who is having a birthday party in an arcade that doesn't know the difference any better between one machine to another does think that that game is DDR.
2690394	2698916	Case in point, you might remember that our very own Loki, and, you know, even though this was questionable, whatever, actually installed, like, a Stepmania thing in a cabinet.
2699396	2699596	Yeah.
2699816	2706358	Now, he didn't make money off of it, which is probably why, you know, everything, you know, and it was only one machine, so, you know, everything...
2707210	2732313	Whatever, and it's gone now, so it doesn't matter But he installed Stepmania, and it was re-skinned And it had the mines, because it was the newer version of Stepmania It was different, and he put it up and running And we all went to Roseville Golf Land one day to check it out And I overheard some girl that just looked like she was there She said to some person that was there, yeah, this is the new DDR, let's go play it It wasn't the new DDR, it looked like DDR though
2734013	2738836	and it had DDR written on the machine still because they had been too lazy to put the new marquee up.
2739337	2750124	Well, you know the other thing that I was thinking that Konami needs to really watch out for is the acronym DDR and Dance Dance Revolution becoming a generic term.
2752385	2762832	In the 80s, I'm going to use this as an example, Xerox released an ad that said something to the effect of Xerox is not a generic term
2763644	2767567	Make sure that you're only using Xerox products when you say, I'm going to Xerox something.
2767747	2771811	Because if someone says, I'm going to Xerox something, they're thinking, oh, you're just going to go over to the copy machine, right?
2772792	2773152	Right, right.
2773312	2780558	Well, you know, the term refrigerator was actually a brand name, and now it's a generic term.
2782139	2785522	You know, Frigidaire, that actually has become a household generic.
2787784	2791007	It's just all, you know, Weedeater, that's now a generic.
2791587	2792408	You know, we...
2793052	2798036	Think of our dancing games, and the first thing that we all think of now is DDR.
2799517	2809645	And I think that what it is, another point is that they may not want the average player to confuse in the group with DDR, to have it become a generic.
2809905	2814009	That's a very interesting point, and I don't think I've seen that point brought up anywhere yet.
2814129	2815150	That's very interesting.
2816190	2816471	Because...
2818620	2824363	Actually, there were quite a few lawsuits concerning generics that people have actually lost.
2824503	2824764	Very good.
2825184	2829306	Oreo, Kleenex, Band-Aid, Aspirin, Coke, Trojan.
2830967	2832708	I don't know about Trojan, but the rest of them work.
2832728	2833588	Thank you guys in chat.
2834169	2838331	Aspirin was, that's correct, I think, cicatrice, aspirin was a trademark before World War II.
2839051	2844854	You know, okay, another one, you know, Motrin.
2846315	2847656	Now we think of that for ibuprofen.
2850383	2876473	so many things that we consider they were individual brandings before DDR is easily going on that path because we think what's the first thing that you're going to think of when someone starts naming off different dancing games the average person is going to go back and think DDR because that is where it all came from
2877065	2877926	NeonFM NeonFM
2903337	2904579	It's like comparing Sonic to Mario.
2904599	2904639	Uh...
2919076	2919656	And I'm like, no.
2919716	2920616	I beg to differ.
2920696	2923797	This is like comparing Mario to Gianna Sisters.
2924198	2931200	And for those of you that don't know what Gianna Sisters was, it was a game that came out on the Commodore 64 in, I think, 88 or so, a couple years after Mario was out.
2931880	2935941	And it was very much like Mario, except they changed it to girls.
2936321	2937061	But this is the thing.
2937382	2938722	This is the irony.
2939282	2941543	The music was better in Gianna Sisters.
2941903	2952085	Gianna Sisters had slightly new elements, but it still had things that looked like Goombas, and still had things that looked like Turtles, and you still got mushroom-like power-ups.
2953105	2954925	Gianna Sisters lost and got pulled from the market.
2955665	2958766	Another point, Pac-Man and Casey Crazy Chase.
2959146	2959866	Or Casey Munchkin.
2959886	2961427	No, it was Casey Crazy Chase.
2961447	2962367	I thought it was Casey Munchkin.
2963907	2968768	For people who don't know, there was a system that came out in the early 80s called the Odyssey 2, which I own one,
2969623	2970644	I don't have a TV to play it.
2971044	2973425	But there was a game that came out called Casey Crazy Chase.
2974186	2976507	And basically it was freaking Pac-Man.
2977288	2983071	Just, you know, really crappy graphics because they didn't have a way to do graphics exactly the same as they were in the arcade.
2983591	2985612	You know, not like today where home games are better.
2986653	2993357	But still, you know, now they actually pulled a bunch of copies and destroyed them.
2993996	3010554	so that's why if you happen to see an Odyssey 2 cartridge for KC Crazy Chase I suggest you buy it because that would be holding a piece of gaming rarity right there very interesting one of the resolution pieces that Konami wants is they want these things destroyed yep
3011553	3014855	So if in the groove home version comes out, buy it right away.
3014995	3017576	No matter how you feel about the game, buy it right away because it could.
3018436	3024159	We don't know how this is going to affect the home version, but I do want to point this out because a lot of people are saying this is not going to affect the release of the home version.
3024799	3025580	I beg to differ.
3025720	3027921	I think this thing is going to get delayed if nothing else.
3028061	3028781	I could be wrong.
3029201	3034564	Granted, as somebody pointed out to me this week when I had a really big ego and I was like, I called this, I called this.
3034824	3036985	When they released the home version, they were going to get sued.
3037958	3041922	Somebody said, Rob, you also said that in the Groove Home version was No Way in Hell ever coming out.
3041942	3043723	I was like, okay, good point.
3044924	3050749	So if this does come out, it would be interesting, but I could almost say with certainty this has to get delayed, at least.
3051009	3054833	Red Octane has got to be scared a little bit right now, or at least waiting to see what comes next.
3055373	3062479	If anybody is, I actually would love to get a statement, an official statement from the folks at Rockstar.
3062499	3062860	Don't we all?
3063756	3070842	The official statement, if you go into the Indigroove forums right now, is a locked thread where somebody said, what's with this lawsuit?
3070863	3077909	And somebody basically said, we have no comment at this time, we are not discussing legal issues on this forum, all further posts on this will be deleted.
3078149	3079090	Not locked, deleted.
3079870	3081652	I'm paraphrasing there, that's not the exact quote.
3082580	3088663	Then apparently their attorney has called for silence prior to... Well, probably they don't know what to do.
3088843	3095165	Remember, the folks that worked on this game... Now, granted, Rockstar Games has been in this a little while before, but with what?
3095205	3096806	They're a small-scale company.
3097146	3101047	The folks that made In the Groove were DDR fans to begin with.
3101527	3103528	They don't know what the hell they've gotten themselves into.
3103548	3105549	This has kind of got to be a slap in the face to them, too.
3105949	3109230	They'll never play DDR again, granted, I would assume.
3109310	3110391	But at the same time...
3111385	3112366	You're paying for that arrogance.
3112446	3112886	I'm sorry.
3114587	3117510	Maybe not necessarily the staff, but you didn't discipline the scene.
3117650	3123134	And the scene has been incredibly arrogant with this whole thing.
3123194	3124595	We do a little radio station.
3124755	3129298	How much research did I put in to see if Originals was copyrighted in the States?
3130699	3134002	I did the research for our name.
3134202	3139786	How are they going to get away with not doing any research prior to making the product?
3140376	3142157	That is just good business.
3142317	3144137	Konami also knows about us and they don't care.
3144638	3146678	Yeah, but we also do good things for Konami.
3146699	3147099	Yeah, we do.
3147459	3147639	Yeah.
3148519	3152061	But... You know, we talk about them negatively sometimes, but it's fair.
3152201	3153641	Everything's fair, I think, and we do.
3153881	3155282	We try to bring you both sides of the story.
3155722	3156082	Exactly.
3156822	3163245	You know, but on top of that, how could they have not, you know, a little bit of homework?
3164586	3166886	You know, it shouldn't have even required the homework.
3167127	3168227	They should have known.
3169096	3174380	There were patents out and copyrights not just for the game itself, you know, for content.
3174740	3175861	There was for concept.
3176101	3177322	There was for the hardware.
3177382	3179903	There was for everything else involved with it, marketing.
3179943	3184767	The weird thing is, is there was this giant assumption in the scene that Andamiro held that patent.
3185127	3189290	But that was proven wrong when Cutress posted those documents that clearly show a U.S.
3189350	3193653	patent for the machine, the sensors, the screen, even though the screen looked a little different.
3194193	3195194	Everything has a U.S.
3195254	3197355	patent by Konami, not Andamiro, Konami.
3197896	3197996	Yeah.
3198016	3198296	Oops.
3199793	3204095	Well, no, you know, and if they had done their homework, they would have found that out.
3204675	3212257	And actually, there are online patent registries where they would actually have the name, the hardware, everything, you can find that all online.
3212918	3215559	For the, what's the patent office?
3216639	3223161	I'm trying to think what the... What handles, I'll find it out later.
3223461	3224482	I'll see if I can't get it online.
3226422	3227923	It would have just taken, you know,
3229161	3230962	I have no mercy to people who do stupid stuff.
3256982	3257803	It's their first time.
3258324	3259585	This whole thing, think about it.
3259925	3267412	You've created this game from the ground up and suddenly somebody wants to buy it, put it in arcades, release it on the PS2, all in the scope of a year.
3268073	3270575	Heads are spinning at the folks who created this game right now.
3270855	3272417	You know, we all make dumb mistakes.
3274338	3276120	I still don't think it's excusable.
3277813	3280794	On top of that, this lawsuit would be on Red Octane's head.
3281394	3282555	Red Octane should have known better.
3283215	3284556	They should have known better.
3284956	3293480	Seeing as how they market the actual physical dance pads, the games, they should have known.
3293560	3294801	But software versus hardware.
3295461	3298803	The lawsuit's not really about... It is and it isn't about the software.
3298823	3303946	The lawsuit's specifically not about the software, but I say it's being done in response to the software.
3304286	3306407	So I think Red Octane probably...
3307099	3308020	And they're probably right.
3308140	3312903	Had the hardware not been all screwy the way that In the Groove became in arcades, it probably would have been okay.
3313724	3314424	So I can't fault them.
3314444	3321370	The only way that they're going to get around at least any future arcade releases, sorry, they're going to have to build themselves a new cabinet and change their interface.
3322430	3322651	Okay.
3323131	3324732	Our chat room is saying shut up already.
3324772	3325653	We're getting confused.
3325673	3327514	There's too much chat going on.
3327554	3327814	All right.
3328255	3329456	Get over it first off.
3329876	3332318	Okay, so what happens next?
3332438	3333198	What do you think?
3333258	3335460	What's your predicted resolution of what will happen?
3338188	3339209	The injunction is going to stay.
3340569	3345212	I think this is how ideally it should go.
3345752	3350195	And I'm thinking, I'm going to do this from the Konami standpoint, and then I'm going to do it from the Roxborough standpoint.
3350936	3354578	Ideally for Konami, the home release of In the Groove will not happen.
3355278	3361422	The injunction will stay, because part of this injunction right now is to protect their interest before there is a court case.
3362802	3363903	They're going to cease production.
3364924	3365144	Now,
3366184	3371227	I also think that they are going to have to pay X amount of dollar for every in-the-groove kit sold.
3373148	3378111	And they can actually assess punitive damages as well.
3378992	3381293	Which are basically like being spanked.
3381934	3383635	You did a bad thing, we're going to spank you now.
3384695	3390679	They also have the right to assess profits lost.
3392899	3396102	As in any, because these are full Japanese machines.
3396522	3397943	Konami of Japan has lost money.
3400165	3402567	I mean, that's essentially how it is, because these machines have to be paid for.
3402787	3406590	Well, but these machines aren't supposed to be, quote unquote, in the U.S., so what happens there?
3406610	3407471	That's kind of a gray area.
3407691	3408992	Could be Rockstar Saving Grace, too.
3409012	3416018	That could be, but also, again, as these machines are publicity, that may have cost them in sales of the home versions.
3416940	3418161	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3445803	3449446	and again, I'm thinking from a legal standpoint, this might be what they can get away with.
3450527	3456011	The software may be permissible, given that it was built from the ground up.
3457232	3472223	This also has to do with a little bit of trade secret, but it would have to be proven through some type of reverse engineering that the home software is not a complete duplicate of
3472834	3474275	of DDR.
3474896	3477118	If they pull that off, the home release will still happen.
3478159	3481222	Now, they're not going to make it out with the hardware issue.
3481922	3485366	They, I think, can get away with releasing future editions.
3485906	3494294	They are going to have to create a unique cabinet and the boards and sell them as a joint unit, the way that Pump It Up goes.
3496337	3499580	Any future releases will have to continue to use that platform only and be upgrades for that unit only.
3499600	3502182	That is the only way that they're going to be able to continue to release any arcade releases.
3518675	3520836	For the first one, I'm sorry, they're fucked.
3521996	3522756	They're going to have to pay.
3524117	3525717	And this could ruin them.
3526198	3528558	This seriously could financially ruin them.
3529559	3533640	This could also, however, put them in a more public light.
3535681	3538042	A negative event can turn into positive publicity.
3538082	3541743	That is a very interesting side point is that a negative event can be publicity.
3541803	3544364	This whole thing could be publicity for them.
3544444	3547545	Although, when you look out on the big gaming websites, it's not...
3548519	3549219	That huge deal.
3549239	3553020	I think most game sites ran a little side story on it, but no major things.
3553280	3566924	So if they are permitted to release the home version, if they are permitted to go through within the group too, with this little bit of controversy going on... Example, Madonna's sex book.
3567984	3568244	Okay?
3569491	3570812	It's the first thing that came to my mind.
3570912	3571172	Okay.
3571552	3572992	The book was banned.
3573032	3573793	She was sued.
3574213	3574933	All this crap.
3575373	3577554	And how popular did that make her?
3577674	3577974	Oh, yeah.
3578175	3578415	Oh, yeah.
3578455	3578715	Yeah.
3579815	3581876	I got to compare the groove to Madonna.
3581916	3583137	That was cool.
3583157	3583957	Which is funny.
3584457	3587018	Get into the groove, boy, you've got to prove.
3587058	3588199	I still think of that song every time I see it.
3588219	3589719	I think that song is public domain now.
3590419	3590660	Maybe.
3590700	3590980	I don't know.
3592567	3594948	I'm kind of similar to your thoughts on this.
3596548	3606110	Because I think this lawsuit is a direct response to the home release, I think that the home release, and I could be wrong, I think the home release will be affected.
3606210	3608130	I don't think this is going to go to court.
3608150	3609631	I think Rockstar and Konami are going to settle.
3610051	3615132	And I think as part of the terms, they're going to recall, but I doubt any of them will be recalled, really.
3615152	3617552	They're going to recall the box or kits or whatever.
3618092	3621333	I think that In The Groove will be stopped.
3622014	3650864	or delayed heavily and Konami will be given a chunk of the profit from the game and I think also as part of it I bet you anything they're going to have to settle where they can't really market the game it's going to have to come out quietly but who knows I might just be thinking crazy but I think that's probably what's going to happen I think though this is my other crazy prediction now tape me in case I'm right I think In The Groove 2 will still come out in arcades under a new name I don't think it'll be called In The Groove 2 anymore
3651087	3652327	There's also the other thing.
3653328	3657869	Konami could obtain any rights to the In the Groove franchise.
3659169	3659810	There's also that.
3660110	3660450	We'll see.
3661910	3667032	And therefore, again, receive a percentage of the profits.
3669933	3670213	Alright.
3671073	3671373	I'm done.
3671613	3673354	I don't want to talk about the lawsuit right now anymore.
3673374	3674714	I'm done with my side of the story.
3675534	3677655	Honestly, when all is said and done, I just...
3678653	3680295	Let the courts figure it out.
3680315	3682157	We're all trying to be lawyers right now.
3682317	3688483	The truth is, we don't really know everything going on because we're not behind the closed doors right now.
3688543	3691746	We don't know what Rakshasa's side of the case is, so we can't really make judgments.
3692266	3695089	But I want to kind of close this segment with this thought.
3696130	3699933	Those of you guys that are saying boycott Konami over this, shut the fuck up.
3700314	3700754	Seriously.
3701095	3703477	There would have been no In The Groove if it wasn't for DDR.
3704187	3706209	I mean, that is a case in point.
3706330	3708712	Absolutely, they would never have been in the group if it wasn't for DDR.
3709714	3712156	Konami has not abandoned their US audience.
3712417	3713598	Konami of Japan?
3714059	3714659	Eh, maybe.
3714880	3715340	But you know what?
3715360	3720266	People in Konami of America are working their ass off to bring you three new games at E3 this year.
3721610	3722450	Seriously, shut up.
3722911	3724651	Boycotting Konami is not going to do anything.
3725452	3727213	Honestly, go ahead and boycott.
3727233	3727953	Get off my machine.
3729193	3733415	The five of you who would be boycotting this, you're not going to make a dent.
3733575	3734696	Sorry, it's not going to work.
3734896	3735296	Go ahead.
3735736	3737137	We're probably just adding fuel to their fire.
3737217	3737657	I don't care.
3737677	3739718	You're a little boycott.
3739738	3742219	You have no respect for where you got your game from.
3742920	3745921	And so if they do some stupid little boycott...
3746684	3748466	That's just going to open the door.
3750007	3751748	Oh, well, I need to see what this is.
3752709	3753290	You're helping.
3753770	3754151	Sorry.
3755111	3760016	You know, honestly, if you want to make a point, get the hell off the DDR boards and start one for In the Groove 2.
3760056	3763619	Because I think In the Groove 2 will happen under a new name.
3763739	3766061	So go figure that one out.
3766221	3767562	You should go back to Spider Stomp.
3768503	3770224	Get out your power pad, play some Dance Aerobics.
3771325	3772546	We'll be back after this break.
3772666	3774428	Your calls on this whole thing.
3775356	3777544	Your calls on the whole thing when we come back after this.

4326291	4327612	Whatever, TakuTak, same to me.
4327912	4329433	Rio and StarMind, sorry that's it off.
4329773	4332635	We're going to go right into taking calls on the Skype line.

4340819	4341580	Yes, DarkSakura?
4342740	4346022	Sorry, I'm just marveling at how delicious this black cherry soda is.
4346182	4347463	Alright, let's get to our first call.
4347503	4349404	Hello, caller, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4350905	4351165	Boo.
4351805	4352906	Boo, who's this?
4355089	4356430	Oh, don't play dumb, Rob.
4356470	4356910	Come on.
4356950	4357670	Not too bad.
4357730	4358751	How about you?
4376256	4380619	Yeah, my brain has been broken and repaired several times trying to go through that thread.
4381099	4386583	I've sworn off posting it a couple of times and then ended up having to come back to correct people yet again.
4387544	4390005	How many warning points would you say you've given out in that thread?
4391366	4401392	Actually, I think I've only dished out two different warnings and one of them somebody is complaining about incessantly because he says that it wasn't merited at all.
4402093	4405335	He said that basically the reason the lawsuit existed was
4405845	4414847	was that they were about to put out a new arcade version and that he saw something about it in a California arcade, somebody showing him pictures on a laptop.
4414947	4418468	And I'm just like, how exactly do you think that's legitimate?
4419148	4420248	Yeah, that's a little weird.
4420468	4434791	Or it kind of goes back to, and somebody had called in, I don't remember if it was last week or the week before, talking about somebody had posted in their live journal that, I don't know, their uncle's sister's brother had posted something about the new machine is coming out for sure this year.
4435991	4437092	I think that was Cucumber.
4437132	4440455	I think he said they were gearing up for a location test in September.
4440715	4445719	No offense against the dude, but I mean, why should I believe him?
4445759	4446520	I guess is what I'm saying.
4446560	4448021	I mean, no offense, but why should I believe him?
4450143	4461993	Yeah, I don't really have any idea what kind of trust he gets in the community, although nobody seems to have been debunking it over at Aaron in Japan where everyone's elite.
4463494	4463935	Who knows?
4465137	4465397	Right on.
4465417	4467077	So what are your thoughts on this whole thing?
4467358	4471839	I remember that you were the one that actually dug up what really happened.
4471999	4473459	What did you think as you were reading it all?
4474839	4485342	Well, I guess I have a little bit of an interest in it to begin with because I've kind of taken it as a personal cause to be debunking all of these rumors with the history of the series and everything.
4486642	4489283	That Andamiro, those Andamiro's rumors and stuff?
4489443	4489703	Oh, yeah.
4489723	4490663	They bug the hell out of me.
4491764	4492504	Yeah, I just...
4494245	4505551	I really can't believe that people would think that as part of settling a lawsuit where you have the upper hand that you would offer to back out of the business market and not go back.
4506092	4507072	Exactly, exactly.
4509554	4513016	So what do you think is going to happen of this whole thing?
4513036	4517258	Do you think Konami has Rockstar's nuts here or what do you think might happen as of this?
4518719	4521200	Well, I could see it going a couple of different ways.
4521280	4521840	I think the
4523587	4530830	The odds are definitely not in Roxor's favor, but this happens to be one special case.
4531610	4536912	I'm not generally the sort of person that seems to be privy to inside information or anything like that.
4537072	4540294	Usually I'm always hearing about things after the fact.
4540374	4550278	Not only was I happy to find out about this before anyone else, since I got word directly from ZipTie over at Konami, but basically...
4551300	4557404	There's a couple of things that we've learned which could end up turning this entire thing on its ear.
4557804	4562748	So I wouldn't have any preconceived notions with regards to how this is going to go.
4563228	4568451	All the fanboys need to die right now.
4569932	4575636	If I'm hearing you right, you say that there are things that we don't know about that could turn this whole thing upside down.
4577048	4580909	Yeah, and I'm not saying it's going to tilt it in any one direction or the other.
4581809	4592572	It's just... Well, basically, it's going to end up being the equivalent, I think, of somebody running in the courtroom and saying, Konami, I am your father.
4594093	4594993	Very interesting.
4595393	4595933	No!
4596253	4597814	That's not possible!
4599436	4605658	Which is basically the same thing I say about all the In The Groove fanboys that want to disown In The Groove from DDR.
4606038	4610800	Basically, Konami just comes over and says, No, Rocksaur, I am your father.
4613341	4620783	And that's exactly what I was saying about those people that are like, Oh my god, let's boycott Konami because they're evil assholes and da-da-da-da-da.
4621024	4626706	You know, if someone stole your shit and then repainted it a different color and put it out, you'd probably be pretty pissed off too.
4627166	4627866	You know, even if you...
4628442	4633185	I think you've even said something along the lines before about how with the community
4640620	4644262	It's DDR when it's convenient, and it's not DDR when it's convenient
4664705	4667807	I want to completely underscore something you said earlier.
4667947	4668267	Okay.
4668367	4669407	Just to make this clear.
4669607	4670508	Good, that'll make me feel good.
4671428	4673609	I have not had a chance to play in the groove yet.
4674230	4676491	I am very much looking forward to my chance.
4676991	4678572	It looks really nice to me.
4678712	4685195	I saw some people playing it at Anime Boston last month when I was in town for that, and it looks very slick.
4686015	4687756	It has some very good production quality.
4688576	4693739	I think that all the new modifiers and everything, yeah, they're step mania, but give me a bit.
4694774	4697896	I think it's something that DDR has needed for a while.
4698457	4701860	Basically it expands on DDR quite a bit and I really appreciate that.
4702380	4704782	I think it's really nice to carry the torch for the series.
4705383	4710287	The only thing that's ever really stopped me from having any serious interest in the game is the community.
4710847	4712168	There are some really good people there.
4712208	4717973	I've talked to several of the Rocksware employees and do talk to them on a regular basis and they're really great guys.
4718434	4718754	I just
4719742	4724646	There are some people in the community that just really need their sticks pulled out of their ass.
4724666	4729130	Their representation on the internet sucks, sadly, for them.
4729210	4737358	Because I'll tell you, at that in-the-group, I was kind of wincing walking in the door of that in-the-group premiere party because I thought people were going to beat me down with sticks.
4737378	4739940	But then I realized nobody listens to this show, so I was okay with it.
4740300	4743964	But I still thought that I was going to be confronted with just extreme asshole-ism.
4745169	4746971	Yeah, I can definitely understand that.
4746991	4747652	Yeah, there's...
4769808	4780150	I think part of the problem is just that the people that are really big fans of In The Groove these days are in some ways really resentful of Konami for having, quote-unquote, abandoned them.
4780430	4785691	And so now they're being rebellious teenagers, if it were.
4785831	4798933	Do you think that that might be more fuel on this boycott fire, where if they feel abandoned by Konami, and now for Konami to suddenly go, wait a minute, even though I abandoned you, I'm going to sue this other game that's come out?
4799994	4802135	Why do people completely ignore the home versions?
4822304	4823384	Yeah, there's no bar to raise.
4823624	4824345	Exactly.
4824665	4827505	Although, I swear to God, Red Octane is thinking about doing one.
4827545	4830146	They're trying to see how they can do one at a good price.
4830406	4832507	I mean, they're going to have to to support in the groove.
4833407	4834867	Your groove bar, 2.0.
4836408	4845210	Yeah, I'm really glad that they're adding the novice system to the home version because that is something that appears to be greatly neglected.
4845330	4847431	I haven't looked over a lot of the step charts myself.
4847970	4855792	But I did get the impression that not a whole lot of pain was put into making of the light and standard steps.
4856472	4859752	Forgive me for not remembering the correct difficulty specifiers here.
4860212	4867954	But basically that's something that I know personally the step authors for Ultramix 2 put a lot of effort into.
4868294	4872935	They wanted to make sure that it was going to be fun to dance and play regardless of what level you're on.
4873862	4880105	There are quite a few songs I can think of on Trick, which are perfectly fun to play, and I don't have to be doing a 7 or 8 foot.
4880705	4890230	I think a lot of the reason, too, that the Ultramix 2 steps were so darn good was because Ultramix 1 really screwed some steps up, especially when it came to the song packs.
4891110	4897193	So I think they really learned from their mistakes, and they almost overcompensated the steps were so damn good.
4897313	4897873	I mean, really.
4899134	4900574	Well, not a whole lot wrong with that.
4900774	4902275	No, we all win from that, I guess.
4904771	4907833	So I guess it's going to be a very interesting E3.
4908833	4910634	I don't know if Rockstar is one.
4910714	4914577	I haven't checked the E3 list, but I'm sure Red Octane is one of the scheduled exhibitors.
4914897	4916258	It's going to be very interesting.
4916358	4920040	I want to go by their booth Wednesday morning and see if there's any mention of In the Groove.
4920340	4921681	I think it's going to be very interesting.
4922061	4925143	What do you think is going to come at E3 from those companies?
4926564	4928125	I haven't heard the latest word.
4928145	4930226	I'm sure Michael Wynn has his
4931986	4932947	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4954383	4960207	But yeah, we're going to be going over there so that we can take a look at the forthcoming release of Pump It Up Exceed.
4960347	4962589	Yeah, I was going to hit on this a little later in the show.
4962609	4964870	I'll go into more detail later, but you're right.
4964930	4967612	MadCatz has announced that they are going to be the ones publishing.
4968073	4970494	And you're right, the cringe was the first thing I did.
4970534	4975318	Actually, my very first thought was, I hope they don't fuck it up like they did their GameCube release.
4976718	4979319	I don't have a whole lot of background in the Pump It Up scene.
4979399	4984141	I actually have an exceed in a movie theater about an hour from me, and that's all that I've really played of it.
4984181	4987402	But CJ Iwakura made a post on our thread on DDR Freak
5002697	5008902	where he basically had indicated that the bundled pad is going to be the exact same one that came out with the Konami release.
5009342	5018850	So regardless of the fact that it is Mad Catz publishing the game, hopefully those of you who are pumpers out there won't have anything really to worry about.
5019451	5019771	Phew.
5021280	5022161	I mean, but I don't know.
5022201	5032047	I'm still a little nervous about having to buy a new dance pad just because the arrows are all different and stuff anyway, which is why In The Groove, had it been released on the home, would have been kind of a nice addition to the library.
5032327	5034469	But with Pump It Up, it's like, great, I've got to get another mat.
5035350	5047938	But if it's a good, solid mat, then, you know, and it's a reasonable price, which I think $60 is what they're currently asking for, it is somewhat reasonable, excuse me, considering everything you get, then, yeah, I'll probably check it out.
5048823	5058291	Yeah, I think that's about the standard price, because if I remember correctly, the DDR bundles that Konami has been putting out lately with the Mark II softpad, those are $60, I'm pretty sure.
5058511	5060013	Yeah, they're about $60 as well.
5061374	5062915	Well, anything else you want to share with us, Cutris?
5063416	5065437	Very interesting perspective, enjoy having you on the show.
5065457	5066698	You've got to call in more often, buddy.
5067879	5071262	Well, now that I actually have a working setup, perhaps I'll do just that.
5071502	5072523	There you go.
5073284	5075486	Let's meet up at E3, since you're going to be going next week, right?
5076460	5077801	Absolutely.
5077821	5088169	I don't know if Shane gave you the schedule or anything that we've kind of got tentative so far, but I definitely want to make sure that I get to hang out with you guys a lot.
5088309	5094373	I have heard the DDR Freak mod schedule loosely, what's going on, obviously, because DarkSakura is a big part of that.
5094673	5097996	I don't know if that includes you and Shane or what, but send me an email.
5098036	5098716	We'll work something out.
5099917	5100257	Absolutely.
5100317	5101478	One more quick question before we go.
5101498	5102519	Okay.
5103465	5106706	non-music game related thing you're most looking forward to seeing at E3?
5109467	5118769	Well, if you had said non-Bimani, then I probably could have answered that right off because I'm really demanding some information about Jam with the Band.
5119829	5125511	But I guess in that vein, I'm really looking forward to whatever Nintendo has set up for the DS.
5125551	5126091	I'm actually a
5126884	5135406	Since I'm not sure if they're going to be offering downloadables for some of their games, or if they're just going to be sending out demos for Mario Kart DS and whatnot...
5150230	5153132	How great is it going to be to just be able to download it and play it on your own damn DS?
5153332	5156013	Yeah, that's going to be absolutely fantastic.
5156333	5157634	Not to have to wait in line.
5157994	5162376	And just because of the way this is working, I'm not taking any chances here.
5162716	5166778	I'm bringing both mine and my wife's DS with me and all the games.
5167058	5168559	So I'm totally confiscating all of that.
5168579	5169660	You're all ready to go.
5170420	5171281	You're all ready to go.
5171421	5171901	Absolutely.
5171921	5173101	I'm going to bring all my stuff too.
5174082	5175282	We'll have to have a DS war or something.
5175302	5178264	I'm bringing my 8th style because I must hunt my hero down.
5178846	5179727	Oh, Akira, if he's there?
5179987	5180527	I hope so.
5181088	5183310	Loki said he's bringing his PSP.
5183350	5185451	He's not taking any chances because he knows PSP's online.
5185471	5187373	He says they could have something surprising.
5187393	5188554	I'm bringing my PSP, too.
5189334	5194158	I said you're a brave man to bring all that crap with you to L.A., especially after my car got broken into this week, but we'll see.
5195159	5195639	All right, buddy.
5195659	5201303	Well, I'm going to let you go so we can get to some more calls, but thank you very much for calling in, and we'll see you at E3, all right?
5202264	5202704	Yes, sir.
5202744	5203425	Thanks for having me.
5203485	5203665	All right.
5203685	5204246	Have a good one, buddy.
5205567	5205767	Bye-bye.
5205807	5206007	Thank you.
5207915	5209056	Cutress from DDR Freak.
5209596	5216280	www.ddrfreak.com Also the home of our replays that we do Friday nights over on DDR Freak Radio.
5216320	5216861	So check it out.
5216881	5219422	They've been very supportive of us in about the past year or so.
5220183	5221844	Well, you know, really ever since the beginning.
5222084	5222884	We've got to work together.
5222964	5224385	But just even more so.
5224425	5225986	Like I've really been feeling the love the past year.
5226126	5226807	So it's great.
5227587	5228047	Let's move on.
5228067	5228708	Let's take another call.
5229768	5231690	This person's been calling in for like an hour now.
5231750	5232250	Sorry, dude.
5232270	5232650	What's up?
5232690	5233531	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge.
5235017	5238138	Yeah, this is SSJ100Mad and Sephiroth1215.
5238178	5238678	Two of you!
5240438	5240578	Ah!
5240798	5241199	Amazing.
5241219	5243359	I don't know if we can handle that much input, but we'll try.
5243419	5243719	What's up?
5243759	5245319	What's your guys' thoughts on the lawsuit?
5247180	5247800	Well, I don't know.
5247840	5250141	I think Rockstar had this coming.
5250161	5259743	I think they planned it out already, so... Wait, so you think Rockstar... Are you saying this whole thing is just smoke and mirrors and that Rockstar has planned this all along?
5261365	5263066	I don't know, they can't be this stupid.
5263106	5264787	They had to have known this was going to happen.
5265927	5268408	I'm going to go back to what I said earlier about Rockstar's lawyers.
5268448	5285076	I think when they were clearing everything and seeing if everything was okay with this, they were probably focusing on the software element of it because you have to admit, the software looks a lot like DDR and they weren't focusing enough on the hardware part of it and somebody really, really fucked up.
5286601	5287562	Someone didn't get the memo.
5287942	5288943	Yeah, someone didn't get the memo.
5289023	5290023	I don't know, but I could be wrong.
5290064	5291024	We'll see.
5291224	5294506	Unfortunately, the community has been too arrogant to fill me in any other way.
5296287	5302791	Got their head shoved way up their asses to the point that they're tasting like tonsil or something.
5302811	5308675	I know, but this whole thing kind of sucks that people who pre-owned it like Sephiroth right over here.
5310196	5313398	Yeah, the folks that pre-ordered it from Red Octane have no idea what's going to happen?
5314855	5316877	Yeah, I know, that's got to be kind of weird.
5316937	5338774	In fact, somebody was actually mentioning to me in the chat room in private message, I hope Dark Knight doesn't mind me reading this, but he said that he actually went over to a GameStop Sunday and they told him it's going to come out May 26th and no info from the lawsuit had reached them yet about it, but I say don't hold your breath because GameStop, electronic boutiques and stuff, never write with this crap, especially when things are getting delayed.
5339474	5342116	Sorry, but you cannot count on that May 26th date.
5342196	5344018	I'll have the word as soon as GameStop gets it.
5345017	5350302	Yeah, because you had the luxury of being with the manager of the GameStop and everything.
5351222	5351783	Yeah, definitely.
5351883	5357087	Well, now GameStop's owned EB, so... Well, that's true.
5357107	5361591	Yeah, but that was pretty cool.
5361771	5362972	Any other thoughts on the lawsuit?
5363072	5364193	Any other things you want to share with us?
5366475	5369398	Nope, just good to be home back in New York, and...
5370646	5371286	Have a good time.
5398254	5398794	We got a lot.
5398974	5399735	Alright, sounds good.
5399775	5401316	How about your friend who's there?
5402897	5403757	Pass the mic or something.
5404117	5404418	Hello?
5405818	5406139	Hold on.
5406439	5406699	Okay.
5407640	5408100	Yes, sir.
5409781	5410121	Hello?
5410741	5411042	Hi.
5411422	5412662	And this is Seproth?
5413023	5414924	No, this is... Is this Seproth?
5414944	5415304	Yeah, yeah.
5416104	5416785	Hey, how you doing?
5417245	5418486	I'm good.
5418566	5420147	Your thoughts on the lawsuit?
5421938	5433047	Um, yeah, you know, I think they really just screwed up on how they put the game on the DDR machines, but otherwise I think everything else should have been fine.
5433067	5436990	That should be like the main thing that Konami should have just sued for.
5437210	5441694	It's almost like they learned their lesson within the group too, but it's like, too late, whoops.
5442697	5445178	So, yeah, you got a good point there.
5445398	5446298	Anything else you want to share with us?
5446318	5447198	That sucks.
5448339	5449119	No, not really.
5449499	5449779	Okay.
5450539	5451080	All right, well.
5451260	5458802	Except for, yeah, I'm pretty pissed that, you know, I pre-ordered that in the groove with the Astro Burner pad bundle.
5459242	5461884	You won't be disappointed with the Afterburner pad, I'll tell you that.
5462304	5464826	I have good things to say about the Afterburner pad, it's marvelous.
5465646	5467127	But yeah, unfortunately.
5467347	5475352	You know what though, Red Octane, from what I've seen, they're a decent company, and they'll do something for you when they give you your money back, if it comes to that.
5475432	5482736	Hopefully it won't, something will be able to happen, or Indigroove can still come out in some capacity, but time will tell.
5482876	5485278	I think we'll find out shortly after E3 what's going to happen.
5486244	5494486	or I don't know, we could find out next week because what a good time to release that kind of news during E3 when there's so much other stuff to divert people's attention.
5494926	5496366	It'll kind of be a good time, you know.
5497146	5498286	Everybody's looking over here.
5498366	5499267	Oh, by the way, we settled.
5499907	5500427	So we'll see.
5502687	5503528	Yeah, hopefully.
5503688	5503988	Alright.
5504488	5508208	Well, I'm going to let you go so we can get some more calls but thank you guys both for calling in, alright?
5509269	5509929	Okay, no problem.
5510049	5515570	And I like this idea, by the way, of the Orange Lounge Radio listening parties so you guys keep it up.
5517756	5518377	Alright, later.
5520098	5520379	Bye.
5522000	5523702	I don't think he knew what to think of that comment.
5525223	5526084	Let's go to this call.
5526124	5527425	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
5528706	5529126	Hey, what's up?
5529186	5530207	It's Ranma from New York.
5530227	5531528	Hello, Ranma from New York.
5532809	5534811	We just got off the phone with some folks from New York.
5535351	5536993	Did you hear what I said to the other guys from New York?
5538601	5539381	Yes, I did.
5539562	5541503	And when you come to New York, I'm going to show you around.
5541723	5541963	All right.
5542203	5546705	Actually, I have a really good friend, one of my best friends in the whole wide world, lives in Connecticut.
5546965	5549046	But that's just a hop, skip it, or jump away from NYC.
5549106	5550067	So we're looking into it.
5551328	5552248	Sweet, sweet.
5552608	5553229	So what's on your mind?
5554489	5554949	Not much.
5555210	5560692	One thing about this whole lawsuit thing, I think Rockstar had a pretty good idea of what was going to happen when they did this.
5560852	5562193	Hey, put it in a DDR machine.
5562393	5562894	Save money.
5563094	5563734	Look what I got you.
5566603	5567364	Maybe you got a good point.
5567424	5574050	Rockstar being the startup it was, just kind of did this as a cost-saving thing, not really thinking about the ramifications of what it could have.
5574850	5575571	Interesting perspective.
5575591	5576031	Basically.
5576692	5577112	Interesting.
5578493	5580055	What are your personal thoughts on the lawsuit?
5580075	5581376	What do you think will happen because of this?
5582902	5588889	I'll wait.
5589470	5594336	I'll personally wait because I know as soon as I say I want my money back, the game comes out and I won't have the money for it.
5596518	5599422	So you actually pre-ordered it at this Anime Expo?
5600816	5601656	Yeah, Anime Boston.
5601756	5602517	Anime Boston.
5602597	5605818	And that must have been last weekend before this whole news came out, right?
5606498	5608118	Oh, that's right, because you gave us your wrap-up last week.
5608138	5608858	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
5608938	5609219	Okay.
5610199	5611559	Oh, man, that's crappy timing.
5611599	5612620	I'm sorry to hear that happen to you.
5613680	5614180	That's okay.
5614240	5614740	It's okay.
5614840	5615140	All right.
5616201	5617661	One other thing before we go to another call.
5619182	5621222	Thing you are most looking forward to hearing about from E3?
5623443	5624563	Nintendo Revolution.
5624723	5630145	And before I go, I'm posting a link from my website to the whole Nintendo World Extravaganza Saturday.
5631105	5633447	Oh, the opening of the store.
5634288	5636049	I want to hear about that.
5636149	5636990	Yeah, tell us more about that.
5637030	5637930	How was the opening of the store?
5638851	5640732	Okay, I got to about 9.30ish.
5640812	5641733	It was kind of quiet.
5641853	5645116	When they picked up some friends, we got back around 11ish.
5645456	5646977	It was jam-packed.
5647297	5650960	Almost every other person was walking around with a DS, nothing but chats.
5651340	5656544	I'm walking up and down the lines taking pictures, and there were two people with PSPs that were getting booed.
5657441	5657941	Oh, okay.
5686892	5687973	Wow, interesting.
5688753	5692415	Okay, well, wow, definitely check out that site and look at the pictures there.
5692595	5696657	One other thing I want to... Did they have DS downloadable or anything there?
5697197	5697417	No.
5698138	5698718	Oh, bummer.
5698758	5699759	I was kind of hoping they would.
5700099	5701960	Give us a sign of what's going to come up for V3.
5703641	5712825	I don't know, but one funny thing was they were handing out free DS silos as you walked in, and they also had little bottles of Nintendo World Water for you to drink.
5713045	5714746	Nintendo World Water.
5715086	5715687	That's awesome.
5715727	5715887	Yes.
5716769	5719290	Pikachu Beetle Pikachu Beetle Pikachu Beetle Pikachu Beetle
5746710	5747911	Is that from his picture down there?
5747971	5749112	Oh, that's cute.
5749172	5753416	Alright, we're going to do another call because there's another person who's been trying to get in and call, so we're going to take this call.
5753737	5754978	Hello, you're on Orange Dance Radio.
5756179	5756459	Hello.
5756800	5757280	Hi, who's this?
5758321	5759042	This is Jaded.
5759582	5760063	Jaded!
5760283	5760803	What's on your mind?
5762685	5763566	Oh, nothing much.
5764175	5766437	What do you think about this whole lawsuit going on right now?
5766537	5767677	Konami versus Roxxor?
5767697	5771900	I just think right now it's too early to make any kind of intelligent decisions.
5771940	5772501	You know what?
5772901	5774142	You bring up a damn good point.
5774262	5782567	And even from somebody who's been sitting here yapping about it for about the past hour, it really is too early to make an informed decision about everything.
5782627	5787931	Although, I gotta hand it off, because of the DDR Freak releasing the actual documents...
5788311	5792458	That helped immensely in trying to figure out, you know, where's Konami coming from on this whole thing.
5792779	5802795	And I think it actually took some of the evilness, the big bad Konami-ness, like, I think it kind of took some of that out because people looked at it and went, you know, well, they kind of do have a point.
5804349	5805610	They kind of do have a point.
5805830	5808732	Right now, it's just too early.
5809192	5814715	Everybody is saying that it's going to go several different ways.
5815836	5819178	Right now, I'm just personally not believing anything.
5819778	5821659	I'm just personally thinking that it's too early.
5821859	5825261	You just have your hands over your ears going, I can't hear you, I can't hear you.
5828003	5829704	Have you pre-ordered in the groove?
5830729	5831210	No, I haven't.
5831250	5836863	I was just curious if you were one of those customers, because I know if I was one of those people that had pre-ordered in the groove, I'd probably be a lot like that right now.
5837223	5838025	I did not just waste $40.
5838105	5839308	La, la, la, la, la.
5839368	5839569	Yeah.
5841877	5842357	Dark Day Dark Day
5869276	5871040	Um, nevermind, I just turned on a light in here.
5871240	5872583	Our webcam, OrangeLensRadio.com.
5873224	5876510	Um, thing you're most looking forward to hearing about from E3 next week?
5878052	5881753	I'm just looking forward to the Final Fantasy Advent Children news.
5907199	5907400	Yeah.
5908182	5909425	I'm hoping they do that again this year.
5910007	5912553	I wish they'd just screen the whole damn movie so we could see it.
5912974	5913857	But I know that won't happen.
5914157	5915922	Because they know that a lot of the fanboys are going to be there.
5919206	5927629	The reason why I'm interested in this is that it's been delayed multiple times, and frankly, I'm waiting for something to happen.
5927849	5928369	Very true.
5928449	5940292	Well, I know that we had posted a story earlier that you, being a big fan of Advent Children, probably have already heard this, but for those that didn't hear about this yet, actually, they did announce that there was going to be a date for this.
5940952	5965392	and it's going to be simultaneous, if I remember right, between the US and Japan so those of you that sometimes feel shafted that Squeenix always gives Japan the good stuff weeks before, or I'm sorry, months, even a year before we get it let's see, the date is September 14th, 2005 simultaneous release in America and Japan UMD release, not a part of that, this is only the DVD but that should be cool right
5967183	5975827	Alright, well thanks for calling and you know what, thanks for bringing up a point that, you know, we really don't know what the hell we're talking about in some aspects with this.
5976248	5977228	So we'll see what happens.
5978369	5979669	Alright, have a good one.
5980009	5980890	It was nice talking to you.
5981010	5981990	Nice talking to you, thanks for calling.
5982791	5983011	Later.
5983331	5983471	Bye.
5984972	5985632	That was nice.
5987233	5988653	A nice young man there calling in.
5988893	5989354	That was good.
5989454	5989754	Alright.
5990566	5991747	and Intelligence Perspective.
5991787	5992288	We like that.
6011611	6012852	So we were lucky in that.
6012892	6016475	So we do have a full-blown regular cage match for you guys tonight.
6016975	6021078	So without further ado, let's get into the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match.
6021298	6023740	For those of you guys still trying to get in on the Skype line, no worries.
6023820	6026022	We will take more calls a little later in the show.
6026102	6027903	So just be patient.
6028103	6028964	Sorry you didn't get through yet.
6030405	6030725	All right.
6031542	6034343	Remember, the way the cage match works, you have to be in our chat room.
6034663	6038124	www.orangeloungeradio.com Click on chat.
6038504	6041205	The way this works, we play three songs for you guys.
6041565	6049188	You pick your favorite, and the winning song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's Gaming Music and More program.
6049588	6053892	which plays 24 hours a day, 7 days a week on this station when we aren't live.
6054393	6055874	Alright, let's get into it.
6055894	6063682	Last week in the cage match, Jamie had put a song in, and you know that right now Jamie is all about the gorillas.
6064835	6065996	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6083411	6090617	This was interesting because last week a little bit of controversy because the song is very quirky and a lot of people either loved it or they hated it.
6090917	6097282	But what happened last week is that it was up against two trance songs which ended up kind of splitting the vote a little bit causing this one to win.
6097302	6098523	I think it would be a fair thing to say.
6098963	6101065	So we shall see if it hangs on again tonight.
6101485	6102746	Here it is, song number one.
6102886	6104688	Only a clip because it won last week.
6105068	6107490	Damon Albren with a rappy song.
6107950	6110852	How appropriate considering the PSO blue burst I've been doing this week.
6111152	6111732	All rappy.
6111972	6112312	All right.
6113053	6114854	Damon Albrin, a rappy song, the remix.
6114954	6115274	Enjoy.
6115294	6116274	All right.
6176537	6178221	Thank you for watching!
6221758	6222799	Thank you for watching!
6294619	6296702	Correct me if I'm wrong, you've misplaced Loki's song.
6307208	6307628	Oh, shut up.
6307648	6308689	Alright, so there it was.
6308709	6311491	Song number one, Damon Auburn with a rappy song, the remix.
6311791	6313672	Okay, here we go into song number two tonight.
6313752	6314532	It's my pick.
6315073	6319735	And this comes off that same dance compilation that I've been putting songs from in lately.
6319916	6321116	And Jamie's already rolling her eyes.
6321396	6322417	But here's the weird thing.
6323177	6325519	I believe this is actually Ayumi Hanasaki.
6326255	6346856	Who showed up on this compilation If it sounds like she's holding her nose, then it is I think it is But she's simply being credited as IU And if it's not her, then it sure sounds like her So I'm picking this song because I like it The song is called Appears So here it is, IU with Appears And I'm going to refer to it as IU because that's the way it's credited on the CD So enjoy
6387479	6389000	Thank you for watching.
6389020	6390621	See you next time.
6474711	6477895	Thank you for watching.
6477935	6478816	See you next time.
6573380	6573980	I.U.
6574060	6575501	with Appears.
6575721	6577181	Definitely, definitely Ayumi Hamasaki.
6577221	6577902	You can't argue that.
6578242	6580563	So I don't know why they build her or something else in Europe, but whatever.
6580663	6583964	Because her dance in Europe is put out as I.U.
6584024	6585744	Okay, that makes sense.
6586265	6586605	All right.
6588305	6589065	We have to rate them.
6589086	6589626	Oh, yeah, we have to.
6589666	6590406	I was just going to move.
6590766	6591206	Move on.
6591846	6593627	Dear Rob, rate.
6593907	6595548	DarkSakura, what did you think of that?
6597048	6598669	Ayumi's voice annoys me.
6599548	6601029	I'm sorry because she's so nasally.
6601569	6613395	And I really like a bunch of her stuff, and I really liked her for a while, but I can't get too excited about Ayumi Hamasaki just because she's been there, done that, you know.
6613435	6614236	It's still solid.
6614496	6615957	It's still trance.
6616057	6616697	It gets a seven.
6618358	6623280	I feel a little bit similar where I'm like, well, it's another Ayumi song, but God, I love her trance stuff.
6623541	6625221	I just love those mixes.
6625682	6626442	They make me happy.
6626502	6627082	I give it a nine.
6627703	6628003	All right.
6628914	6629835	I know exactly what this is.
6629855	6631717	I have no idea what to expect.
6631737	6634019	Here it is, song number three, Loki's Gin and Juice, Ted Koppel.
6675386	6685633	With so much drama in the ABC, it's kinda hard being Ted K.O.P., but I, somehow, someway, keep coming up with funky-ass shit like every single day.
6686093	6692137	May I kick a little something for the G's and make a few N's as I breeze through.
6692437	6695839	Two in the morning and the party's still jumping cause my mama ain't home.
6695920	6701183	I got bitches in the living room getting it on, and they ain't leaving till six in the morning.
6701974	6703015	So what you wanna do?
6703195	6706378	Shit, I've got a pocket full of rubbers and my homeboys do too.
6707099	6713725	So turn off the lights and close the doors, but... Yeah, so we gon' smoke an ounce to this.
6713925	6717268	Jeez up, hose down while you motherfuckers bounce to this.
6720592	6723855	I'm Ted Koppel and this is Laid Back.
6729693	6735196	Sources close to the White House today confirm that the president is laid back.
6735896	6741459	Now that I got me some Seagram's Gin, everybody got they cups, but they ain't chipped in.
6741920	6744121	Now this types of shit happens all the time.
6744161	6746642	You gotta get yours, but fool, I gotta get mine.
6747042	6749804	Everything is fine when you're listening to the T.E.D.
6749924	6753426	I got the cultivatin' music that be captivatin' he who listens.
6753866	6759769	To the words that I speak as I take me a drink to the middle of the street and get to mackin' this bitch named Katie.
6759789	6760330	Katie Curran?
6760530	6762231	She used to be the homeboy's lady.
6762351	6762891	Oh, that bitch?
6763311	6768954	Eighty degrees when I tell that bitch, please raise up off these NUTs cause you get none of these at ease.
6770075	6773817	As I mob with the dog pound, feel the breeze, biatch, I'm just.
6776298	6780641	Earthquakes rocked Tokyo, Japan today as residents were laid back.
6785689	6791118	Residents in a small New England town are terrified as a mass murderer is laid back.
6791158	6793922	With my mind on the money and the money on the line.
6794466	6802933	Later on that day, my homie Sam Donaldson came through with a gang of Tanqueray and a fat-ass J of some bubonic chronic that made me choke.
6803053	6806616	Shit, this ain't no joke, I had to back up off of it and sit my cup down.
6807056	6811880	Tanqueray and chronic, yeah, I'm fucked up now, but it ain't no stoppin', I'm still poppin'.
6812200	6819846	Sam got some bitches from the city of Compton to serve me, not with a cherry on top, cause when I bust my nut, I'm raisin' up off the cot.
6820166	6822328	But don't get upset, girl, that's just how it goes.
6822388	6823308	I don't love you, hoes.
6823368	6832075	I'm out the door, and I'll be... Residents of Baghdad fired shots wildly into the air as protesters were laid back.
6832095	6833295	I'm Ted Koppel, and this is Laid Back.
6848030	6849371	Okay, now here's a question.
6849531	6854493	What is the BH?
6854913	6855754	Right, see, exactly.
6855814	6857835	I just don't, I don't understand.
6857875	6859796	I don't, I don't know what that word is.
6860736	6862057	Is that, is that how it's pronounced?
6862497	6863417	Right, yeah.
6863837	6866919	I just, I, I just, I don't understand.
6876570	6880594	Sound number three, Darth Punk, Ted Koppel's Gin and Juice.
6881394	6884037	Juicy or not juicy?
6884097	6885518	Juicy like a wet fart.
6886439	6887680	What'd you think, DarkSakura?
6887840	6891183	The first time I heard that, I thought it was intensely retarded.
6891484	6894186	He wanted me to put it as a fortune cookie, and I refused to.
6895688	6897389	So it gets a big whopping .5.
6899583	6925228	Just cause I like how he does the blah blah blah blah and leaves back Cause I thought that part was funny You know, Loki played that for me too, saying it was like the funniest thing he'd ever heard And I was like, this is not the funniest thing I've ever heard Jokes that Diane Mita Zoda makes on G4 can be funnier than this, I'm sorry If you're gonna be funny and do a parody song, be funny I give that song a zero, it's awful
6926167	6927688	Alright, let's recap.
6927728	6929849	But it's not up to us, it's up to you guys.
6929909	6930889	Maybe you thought it was funny.
6931450	6931850	I don't know.
6932370	6934991	So here it is, the three songs you get to vote for tonight.
6935091	6939093	Song number one, Damon Albrin, a rappy song.
6939354	6939874	The remix.
6947057	6950119	And song number two you can vote for tonight is IU with Appears.
6959349	6963672	and song number three you can vote for tonight, Darth Punk, Ted Koppel's Gin and Juice.
6967475	6972139	George is close to the White House today, confirmed that the president is laid back.
6972859	6974541	There, I got a laid back in there for you, Jamie.
6974701	6975461	I liked that one.
6975501	6977343	That's all I like about the song.
6977383	6979344	Place vote now.
6979445	6982787	Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.
6982847	6983428	Hurry, hurry.
6983468	6985529	We'll add him up and let you know who the winner is.
6986390	6986470	Um...
6987404	6987944	You know what?
6988004	6993086	He sounds like... You remember the two Muppets that sat up in the balcony and made fun of all the other Muppets on the Muppet Show?
6993527	6994667	That's what he sounds like in that.
6994987	6997288	Yeah, it's... Laid back!
6999889	7002890	Yeah.
7004691	7005811	Don't vote for Holic.
7005911	7008012	Votes for Holic are thrown out, okay?
7008993	7011134	There's always a movement in the chatroom to vote for Holic.
7011454	7016996	Remember, the winning song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio.
7017611	7021374	Holic is in permanent rotation already on Orange Lounge Radio.
7021654	7023556	You don't need to vote it into rotation.
7023656	7024357	It does no good.
7026599	7027720	Just wanted to make that clear.
7028580	7036467	I realize some of you like to vote for Holic when you feel that the rest of our songs were crappy or something like that, but just deal.
7038146	7045068	Anyway, this is the part of the show where Loki would typically give us the sim scene update and tell us what's going on in the sim scene.
7045489	7048570	However, I have no idea what's going on in the sim scene right now.
7049130	7053471	A bunch of stuff happened, but not really, because it's sims.
7053571	7061254	I'll bet you what, probably this lawsuit has people freaked out about making any sims right now.
7061934	7065416	A bunch of crappy Max remixes were released on Mamani Style, what can I say?
7067529	7067929	No, no, no.
7068029	7074392	ParanoiaMax.5007 Let's talk about the real thing, shall we?
7074412	7075132	The real deal.
7075172	7075812	The real thing.
7076833	7078013	Yeah, in the groove.
7078173	7078574	No, no, no.
7078774	7079514	Even better than that.
7079954	7084116	Konami has launched something on their website.
7084256	7089898	And what it is, it is a teaser pic for a brand new DDR.
7090038	7096481	And you can see it on our website at www.orangeloungeradio.com And in this video it appears to have...
7097188	7099510	I'm sorry, not a video, sorry, a picture.
7099610	7103253	It appears to have maybe some captures from new videos or something.
7103953	7106255	But it does indicate that a new DDR is coming out.
7106575	7109677	However, in the corner, it says it's coming out on PlayStation 2.
7110358	7113000	So I think people got excited at first that this is a new arcade mix.
7113620	7114340	It doesn't look like it.
7114381	7119985	This is probably Japan's version of whatever we're getting with Xtreme 2.
7120305	7123167	Such as Festival was like our DDR Xtreme.
7123860	7127161	This is probably their version of what we're going to get as Xtreme 2.
7129522	7132322	And of course, we talked about Xtreme 2 a little bit last week.
7132503	7133863	EyeToy stuff coming back.
7135783	7140685	It's going to have the Oops I Did It Again rumored online play and all that fun stuff.
7140705	7142205	We'll know more, of course, next week.
7143746	7150648	It doesn't seem like any big surprise that this would be ported to Japan as well and be coming out there.
7151128	7151208	Or
7151894	7155324	Maybe we're getting the port, it's hard to say, but no surprise, really.
7155825	7159035	Things you would like to see in the next PlayStation release of DDR, Jamie, anything?
7160618	7165580	I can't really say, you know, because the one thing I wanted was freaking Dance Magic.
7166141	7167721	I just want Dance Magic mode to come back.
7168161	7182608	Yeah, you know what, and what you almost kind of said, is that In The Groove has a mode like that, although not as many people play it as you'd think, and it was going to be in the home release and everything, and now it's not, well, we don't know yet, but now it's questionable if it's coming or not.
7184569	7186870	Well, you know...
7188015	7190577	DDR doesn't make you a better dancer, so that's one thing out, you know.
7194559	7200562	I really can't think of anything else that they could really... There's that, you know, dinky little RPG mode thing, right?
7201683	7202383	That's in Ultramix 3.
7202423	7203484	Oh, Ultramix 3.
7204344	7206866	No, I can't... I really hope they're demoing that.
7206926	7208127	DDR Whack-A-Mole!
7209487	7212889	Oh my god, that would be... They need to put DDR Whack-A-Mole in.
7213830	7215591	Wouldn't the makers of Spider Stomps sue him?
7216912	7218453	But that's not really whack-a-mole.
7218533	7220053	Oh, because it's moles and not spiders.
7220514	7222154	And they don't pop up out of the ground.
7222635	7230278	And you're actually stepping on the thing itself, but there's no TV on Spider Stump either.
7230358	7231098	So, aha!
7231419	7232659	I know my legal crap.
7232739	7233720	It's in a different cabinet.
7235260	7236401	No infringement there, no?
7237461	7237981	Not at all.
7239262	7240403	Okay, um...
7242012	7243833	Loki popped into chat really fast.
7243873	7247455	I guess he managed to tear himself away for a little bit to listen to the little show.
7247495	7247835	Hi.
7249196	7254139	He says, and I quote, nothing much is happening in the sim scene, just more crappy sim files.
7254599	7255360	See, I called it.
7256020	7260063	You know what, we ought to just fire Loki because I'm able to do the sim scene report myself every week.
7260543	7261023	No, I'm kidding.
7261103	7261764	We would never do that.
7262404	7263164	He'll be back next week.
7263224	7264665	He'll be with us for the podcast as well.
7266366	7268988	Alright, last call for the cage match votes, you guys.
7269028	7269628	Get them in here.
7270849	7270929	Um,
7271431	7277614	Also, what we're going to do next break, I think we're going to try and do that list list, except my roommate is getting cold feet now.
7277654	7278375	He doesn't want to do it.
7278815	7283838	So how about we have two, we can't do two Skype lines, can we?
7283858	7284898	No, we'll just have three people.
7284918	7286219	We'll do a three-person list.
7286319	7290801	One person in PM and one person on Skype line.
7290842	7292963	So one person in private message and one person on Skype line.
7292983	7294704	All right, I'll try to figure out who those people are going to be.
7295024	7296565	I'm picking people I want.
7297185	7297905	Trivia question.
7298065	7298706	It's an easy one.
7298926	7299146	All right.
7300410	7301411	Who is my favorite?
7301571	7301871	No, no, no.
7302011	7302391	No, no, no.
7302871	7303652	No question.
7303672	7304752	I want to pick up people who are doing it.
7305173	7305753	If that's okay.
7305933	7306613	No, seriously.
7306653	7308474	I think that we should give a fair opportunity.
7308914	7309315	All right.
7309355	7312756	How about we Skype in somebody I want and we'll let somebody from the chat room do it?
7312776	7312897	Okay.
7313057	7314217	So the trivia question... Wait, wait, wait.
7314317	7316458	Don't give the trivia question yet because I'm still... Well, I want them to think about it.
7316478	7317639	I'm telling you in cage match votes.
7317679	7318900	I don't want them to send it in yet.
7319060	7319280	Okay.
7319300	7320741	Well, don't... All right.
7325285	7326165	Hold on, I'll finish up.
7326445	7327746	Any thoughts you have for us, Jamie?
7327766	7330607	Why don't you tell us about some of the spit-off programming we have here on Orange Lounge Radio?
7331067	7334888	Well, on Monday, we happen to have Diversion that starts at a net moon time to me.
7335329	7335769	Seven o'clock.
7336129	7337509	Actually, Diversion got cancelled.
7337930	7338330	What?
7338770	7339730	Diversion's cancelled, remember?
7339750	7340691	You didn't tell me this stuff.
7340991	7341311	Sorry.
7342331	7344372	This is what I get for sleeping through a board meeting.
7345152	7345912	Fuck.
7346193	7350874	Coming soon to Orange Lounge Radio, the Dance Mania show is coming to Monday nights to replace Diversion.
7350914	7351074	Yes.
7356087	7357907	You better drink Diet Coke.
7379192	7385640	The actual show will start at 7.30 and the concept is requesting stuff but people don't request shit so I just end up playing whatever.
7386821	7390285	Of course no show this week because I will again be in a car on my way to E3.
7390746	7396473	However, I will be coming back and uh
7397779	7401922	Filling your head with, I think, an anime marathon, I'm thinking this time.
7402443	7413451	The last time, see, I've noticed that my pre-shows have been turning into sort of repeat performances of what you might hear on Pump Up the Volume.
7413591	7416373	So, if you like what you hear on the pre-show, be sure to tune in.
7417782	7419163	All right, let's do the cage match winner.
7419363	7419643	You ready?
7419663	7420563	We don't have another show.
7420723	7422464	No, we don't have another show right now.
7422744	7423785	It's just me.
7423885	7425765	It's the Jamie show.
7425825	7428907	Jamie's by herself, and then we're going to have a whole lot of new programming at the end of the month.
7429047	7429487	I promise.
7429627	7431768	But I still love you, and I will stay constant.
7431988	7432368	All right.
7433289	7434069	I, however, do not.
7434689	7435270	Okay, here we go.
7435810	7437771	The winning song of tonight's cage match.
7438231	7438571	You ready?
7439371	7441972	Tonight's winning song is... A tie.
7443713	7445514	Song number one that tied in tonight's cage match.
7448078	7449038	IU appears.
7450879	7452740	Kind of a given considering the crowd we got here.
7452800	7454861	Song number three that tied in tonight's cage match.
7457082	7459683	What the fuck?
7459803	7460183	Okay.
7460703	7461863	Ted Koppel's Gin and Juice.
7461883	7470007	Before you say anything, Jamie, let me remind folks, in case of a tie, the host whose song did not make the tie gets to break the tie.
7470067	7472668	That being said, Jamie, tough decision here.
7472908	7473648	What are you going to go with?
7487159	7488380	I'm going to torture you.
7489000	7491801	I'm going to see you crack and bleeding under my whip.
7492422	7493442	You get Ted Koppel.
7495643	7497104	Jamie votes for Ted Koppel.
7497204	7498844	I cannot believe that the song you gave a .5
7508715	7509235	The demon is hot.
7521656	7523077	Dude, he's older and still hot.
7523258	7526040	Dude, you lucked out with that win last week.
7527101	7530745	Even you have to admit, considering the chatroom's reaction, you lucked out with that win last week.
7531646	7541135	Yeah, but I have to make sure that I put in a song that won't win next week because the week after is the week after.
7541655	7543277	Oh, that was a strategic vote.
7543317	7544197	That's what you were doing.
7544237	7545739	You did that so that you could win next week.
7546511	7553374	But I did want to make an announcement because I think I can legally get away with it as I'm going to be playing the entirety of Demon Days on the 23rd.
7553994	7555535	Because it will have been released in the UK.
7557076	7557436	Super.
7561478	7563338	I don't get you, Jamie, by the way.
7563378	7565319	I am a woman!
7566660	7569161	And by rights... Alright, woman, I don't get you.
7569801	7574783	I can change my mind and do everything I can to confuse men.
7575144	7575784	Alright, I'm done.
7576992	7578193	Um, here we go.
7578213	7579734	The power of estrogen.
7579774	7580695	Let's, list, list.
7581456	7585459	Let's remind... Shut up.
7586380	7586800	List, list.
7587200	7587661	Make me!
7588888	7597475	The way this list works, we are going to come up with the definitive list of things for Orange Lounge Radio to stick on the E3 Katamari.
7597575	7598996	The definitive list, okay?
7599297	7611407	The way it works, myself, Jamie, and two mystery guests will be coming up with a list of four items each, and then we each take one off the list.
7611467	7613669	And you guys get to vote on the definitive list.
7613689	7614990	We'll explain it as we move on.
7616130	7619511	In order for us to get to that point, though, we need a contestant from chat.
7620151	7621311	I'm going to get somebody on Skype.
7621371	7623311	I'm going to handpick one of our guests to get on Skype.
7624111	7627072	But we are going to have a contest in the chat room to see who gets in there.
7627092	7631013	So the first person to answer this correctly is going to be doing the other list.
7631313	7635953	But please don't answer unless you have some ideas for this list list, because I don't want you sitting there going, I don't know.
7636194	7636774	I'll tell you what.
7637194	7640594	Send the PM to me so that Rob is not inundated with PMs.
7640774	7641214	Okay, thank you.
7641414	7643215	I'm in the chat room at DarkSakura SSF.
7643575	7644235	The question...
7645265	7647207	Who is my favorite member of Gorillaz?
7647247	7649749	Who is my favorite member of the band?
7660717	7662998	Favorite member of the animated band Gorillaz.
7663059	7665440	If you've been paying attention to this show in the past few weeks, you should know.
7665680	7670183	First person to send that correctly over private message to Jamie will get the privilege.
7670743	7672304	Listeners never get this privilege.
7672625	7673525	This is a special night.
7673545	7674566	You're lucky Loki's not here.
7674946	7676807	To participate in Listless with us.
7676847	7678648	Meanwhile, I'm going to hook up somebody over Skype.
7678728	7680229	I'm going to find somebody on Skype.
7680770	7687594	And we will be back after this featuring some music from... Well, more potpourri, I think.
7687614	7689035	But we're going to start it off with Burning Heat.
7690168	7692170	Because that song, Gin and Juice, gives me burning heat.
7693312	7694393	Gives me burning itch.
7694573	7695154	All right, here we go.
7695174	7695875	We'll be back after this.
7756460	7757822	Thanks for watching!
7800970	7801871	Thanks for watching!
7902225	7906647	I'm finding it hard to believe we're in heaven.
8063385	8067412	Days when I couldn't live my life without you
8093407	8093827	Hello?
8094628	8095628	Hello, is this thing on?
8095689	8096209	Testing.
8097390	8098250	Testing, one, two.
8098831	8102793	I'm looking in the index, but I don't see anything for how to run a radio show.
8102893	8103354	Hello?
8104034	8105495	I don't understand this.
8105515	8106876	Does this thing work?
8106896	8108497	This thing reads like stereo instructions.
8108557	8109178	Is this on?
8109198	8109778	What the hell?
8112340	8116102	Orange Lounge Radio, broke down ghetto Bomani Radio.
8116122	8116723	What the f***?
8119844	8126026	We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, and we are going to do some listless.
8126786	8127526	Yay!
8128567	8131127	So, the way listless works, just a quick reminder.
8133348	8134268	We're doing three, just three.
8134608	8141110	We are each going to pick our top three, myself, DarkSakura, and who is your winner, DarkSakura?
8141350	8142911	Our winner is Ranma!
8143031	8145992	Ranma, okay, and then we're going to get somebody special here on the Skype line right now.
8148193	8149633	Doop-a-doop-a-doo, just waiting for the phone.
8151511	8152131	One ringy dingy.
8152291	8152692	Hello?
8153112	8153612	Hello?
8154072	8155333	Is this Miklatov?
8157494	8157934	Hello?
8158054	8158955	Hello, Miklatov?
8160315	8160895	Yeah?
8161016	8161576	Can you hear me?
8166098	8166878	I don't know if he can hear me.
8167178	8167599	Are you there?
8168619	8169239	I can hear you.
8169920	8171360	Okay, but you can't hear yourself?
8173721	8174042	What?
8174442	8175422	What are you talking about?
8175562	8176343	Can you hear me?
8176643	8177603	I'm confused.
8177943	8178984	He can hear us.
8179664	8180505	We can hear him.
8180565	8181085	We're good.
8181753	8182453	I can hear you.
8182653	8183213	Okay, good.
8184234	8184654	Okay, good.
8185094	8186775	You just freaked me out for a little bit there.
8186915	8187295	Damn.
8187555	8187895	All right.
8188915	8189375	I'm sorry.
8189735	8190316	That's all right.
8190516	8191236	How are you doing, sir?
8192436	8193317	I'm doing pretty well.
8193657	8195897	Looking forward to E3 next week?
8198518	8199018	To what?
8199238	8201159	Are you looking forward to E3 next week?
8202499	8202699	Yeah.
8203400	8205380	Okay.
8205880	8208081	You're breaking up because you're on the computer.
8208401	8208661	Hold on.
8209141	8209721	Oh, I'm sorry.
8209822	8210022	Okay.
8210382	8211362	Now I think I can hear you better.
8211590	8212692	Okay, there you go.
8214434	8216056	Are you going to stick things on the Katamari?
8217538	8217738	Yeah.
8218038	8219060	Okay, good.
8219100	8219761	Hopefully we will.
8219981	8220261	All right.
8220522	8223806	Well, we're going to get your top three, but you have to wait your turn.
8223846	8224727	So you have your list ready?
8225608	8226089	It's my turn?
8226429	8227350	No, it's not your turn yet.
8228251	8228972	I'll let you know when.
8228992	8230915	You're going to give us your answers, okay?
8230935	8231015	Okay.
8232421	8232882	VOTE ONE OFF
8251539	8258723	So then after each one song has been voted off, we will have a list of eight, because we'll have two from each person left.
8259003	8265247	We'll have a list of eight, and then the chat room gets to vote on their favorite to come up with a top three list.
8265567	8266468	So tonight's list list...
8267395	8274057	Things we want to stick on the Katamari at E3, or should I say things we should stick on the Katamari at E3.
8274417	8275177	I'll go first.
8275757	8279698	I'm actually stealing ideas from the chat room tonight because I think they actually have some decent ideas.
8280178	8288200	And my number three pick is Calamari, as somebody said, because I think the phrase sticking Calamari on the Katamari, it's kind of cute.
8288460	8292001	And it sounds like it actually could be a song in Katamari Damacy 2.
8292521	8294082	So I'm saying Calamari.
8295402	8295682	All right.
8297506	8302268	Miklatov, what's your number three pick for things that you want to stick on the Katamari?
8304009	8311452	Well, I would like to put Mad Catz on the Katamari, just so it could be rolled away and shot off into space so they don't have anything to do with Pump It Up.
8312332	8316634	Okay, so he's going to stick the entire company of Mad Catz.
8316654	8317174	All of Mad Catz.
8317294	8318334	All of Mad Catz.
8318394	8319035	That's what I wanted.
8319295	8325337	So you're going to have to get the prints to roll up a big Katamari first, and we're just going to roll over the Mad Catz building.
8326598	8327318	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
8328058	8329259	Well, hopefully it's Mad Catz.
8329319	8330500	It shouldn't be that big.
8330520	8333242	I can get a little binky-sized one.
8333642	8334502	I have no idea why.
8334543	8337745	He didn't send me a reason why, but he wants to put a Mustang on there.
8360174	8376781	Alright A little bit of dinner there, sorry Jamie, your number three pick The Gorilla's Jeep, spelled G-E-E-P The Gorilla's Jeep, why the Jeep?
8377102	8386086	Well, at least what's left of it since it's apparently smashed all of the basement under the car park You do understand it's a cartoon, right?
8388127	8388627	You shut up!
8391315	8391755	All right.
8392796	8393136	Let's see.
8393196	8394597	Did Ranma tell me why the Mustang?
8395198	8395618	Oh, okay.
8395678	8397979	He says, Mustang cars rock.
8398240	8398660	I love them.
8399260	8400001	Yes, they do.
8400341	8400621	All right.
8401882	8402422	Let's see.
8403123	8405865	My number two pick for something I want to put on the Katamari.
8406285	8415491	My number two pick is, originally I said, let's take all of Lanky Styles' Paula's Terry CDs and put them on the Katamari so we can be rid of them forever.
8416708	8419551	But actually somebody in the chat room came up with something better, so I went with this.
8420011	8425416	Put all of the shitty Max 300 remixes on one CD and put it on the Katamari.
8426116	8429319	So all the shitty Max remixes, let's just roll them away.
8429479	8434343	So shitty Max 300 remix CD is my number two pick.
8436485	8438046	Mik Latav, what's your number two pick?
8440488	8443651	I would want to put the tiniest picture...
8444432	8449414	of a bear I could on the Katamari, and you would understand it if you've played the game.
8451355	8455616	So if you've actually played the game, you'll understand why he wants to put the tiniest picture of a bear.
8455736	8458197	That really pissed me off when making the Ursa Major.
8460478	8460798	All right.
8462719	8469521	Number two from Ranma, I'm reading it from the chatroom, he wants to put, he's going to put a Big Mac with cheese on the Katamari.
8470154	8473037	Although you have to remember, no food is supposed to be on the... No, did they say no food?
8473377	8473937	I guess they did.
8474318	8474878	I don't think they did.
8474898	8478261	I think they only said clothes and X-rated things, but... No, I think foods included.
8478361	8480563	Oh, well, I said calamari, so we'll let them say Big Mac.
8480983	8484346	Big Mac, because it would be fun to roll it and see if it is edible.
8485147	8485247	Ew.
8487569	8487689	Ew.
8489130	8490431	All right, Jamie, what's your number two?
8490592	8491472	The retard ferret.
8494235	8494335	Me.
8497304	8499786	And the retard ferret is the one that keeps making the same noise over and over.
8499906	8501707	We actually are going to put that on the Katamari, by the way.
8501868	8502048	Yes.
8502248	8502468	Okay.
8503909	8505190	My number one choice.
8506471	8506791	Here it is.
8506851	8509253	My number one choice for things I want to put on the Katamari.
8509674	8515198	I want to put a copy of Katamari Damacy on the Katamari, just to be ironic.
8515478	8516259	That would be funny.
8516899	8517980	You know, we could do that.
8518600	8522303	Not like actually put the game on there, but like do like a blank CD-R with the label on it.
8522703	8523244	That would be funny.
8523507	8525488	I want to put a bumble ball on it, because it looks like a Katamari.
8525508	8525788	A bumble ball?
8525808	8527108	Oh my god, he's right, they do look like a Katamari.
8527128	8529389	They totally look like Katamaris.
8529769	8530889	See, he's being ironic, too.
8530989	8531869	Good pick, Miklatov.
8549387	8551449	Um, Ranma, number one.
8552109	8555051	He wants to put a Nintendo DS on the Katamari.
8555652	8556272	Okay.
8556452	8559034	Because the DS is too awesome not to put on there.
8559554	8562537	I say that that's about the only good thing your DS can do right now.
8562837	8563557	Ah!
8564118	8565359	I'm taking my DS with me.
8565679	8567560	No, I know, E3 will change our minds.
8567620	8569902	The Nintendo DS will be beautiful after E3.
8570022	8574365	Um, but right now I'm kind of pissed because, like, you call Polarium a game?
8576767	8577167	All right.
8577611	8580252	What's your number one, DarkSakura?
8580532	8583113	A gigantic, huge mungus.
8583973	8585193	Reject false icon sticker.
8585413	8588374	Reject false icon sticker, and why is that?
8589095	8601118	Because the giant Katamari will probably be made up of a bunch of false icons, and what better to put on it than a big sticker that tells them that they should all go do something useful, like be a real star.
8601138	8602159	There you go.
8602279	8602679	All right.
8603411	8606813	Listen carefully, Miklatov and Ranma in the chatroom.
8606853	8613257	Listen carefully because you have to figure out which one of these you want to vote off of the list.
8613737	8615478	One of these you have to vote off the list.
8617880	8618520	I will start.
8618560	8619081	Did I start?
8619481	8619921	Yeah, I did.
8620241	8620562	Here it is.
8620662	8631028	Calamari, Mad Catz, Mustang, Gorilla's Jeep, Shitty Max 300 Remix CD, Tiniest Picture of a Bear,
8631801	8641766	Big Mac with Cheese, Retard Ferret, a copy of Katamari Damacy, Bumble Ball, Nintendo DS, and a Reject False Icon sticker.
8642927	8644788	I am going to take off this list... Huh?
8644928	8645268	A huge one.
8645288	8645528	A huge one.
8645729	8646049	A big one.
8646929	8650231	I'm going to take off a Big Mac with Cheese, because that's just kind of weird.
8650311	8652612	Sorry, Ranma, but I don't even like McDonald's to begin with.
8652932	8654874	Except I do like that walnut salad they have now.
8654914	8655714	It's actually kind of yummy.
8655974	8656915	The Cobb salad's pretty good.
8657135	8657275	Mm-hmm.
8657775	8658075	All right.
8658255	8659116	Meek Latav, you there?
8659136	8661097	I thought...
8661499	8661999	Miklatov?
8663040	8663280	Yeah.
8663521	8664842	Okay, what are you taking off the list?
8666123	8666943	Um, a Mustang.
8667344	8668264	The Mustang!
8668324	8669185	Why the Mustang?
8670566	8672087	It doesn't make any sense to me.
8672668	8674089	Okay, poor Ranma.
8674189	8676131	Like, his whole list just almost got axed.
8676291	8676611	Alright.
8677472	8683256	Um, Ranma hasn't sent me which one he's going to vote off yet, so I guess, Jamie, you're going to be next.
8683316	8683977	Let me see the list.
8687339	8687740	Sorry.
8687760	8687800	Um...
8690342	8691363	DarkSakura, here it is.
8691724	8692945	Do you need that a little bigger there?
8693185	8693926	Don't highlight it, please.
8694106	8694447	Oh, sorry.
8695187	8695888	I didn't need it bigger.
8695968	8696569	Just don't highlight it.
8696769	8697049	My bad.
8698071	8704337	Uh... Uh... God.
8704358	8706600	You know what?
8706720	8709163	Take off Mad Catz, because then... Aww.
8710203	8710723	The Nintendo DS.
8738451	8739172	Guerrilla's Jeep
8754694	8768063	a shitty Max 300 remix CD, the tiniest picture of a bear, the retard ferret, a copy of Katamari Damacy, Bumble Ball, Nintendo DS, and a large reject false icon stickers.
8768403	8769964	Place your vote now.
8770264	8775027	Send a private message to Sky with what you want to be at the top of this definitive list.
8775587	8776688	Thanks for playing, Mikotov.
8776728	8777308	Appreciate it.
8778269	8778789	No problem.
8778909	8781511	Hey, what are your plans for E3 next week?
8781531	8782672	What do you hope to see at the show?
8784485	8788328	I'm actually really looking forward to going to play Phantasy Star Universe.
8788348	8790109	I didn't know it was going to be there.
8790449	8791570	Yeah, his voice is kind of quiet.
8791590	8791890	Sorry, guys.
8791930	8794072	It's Phantasy Star Universe is what he said.
8794272	8795633	I'm looking forward to that as well.
8795653	8797494	We played PSO Blueburst with us last night.
8798174	8798815	Yeah, it was fun.
8798855	8799335	Good times.
8799535	8800436	It was awesome.
8800736	8801136	It was good.
8801276	8804218	Now that I'm in the caves, I can level more faster.
8804238	8807140	Thank you for letting me leech all the loot because I was poor.
8807180	8808921	It's okay.
8809061	8810382	I'm poor now because I have 75 Meseta.
8813874	8817978	If I didn't have to pack tonight, I would totally play more.
8818338	8819819	I get to pack tomorrow.
8820160	8821521	My ass is playing.
8821721	8823903	24 hours from now, I will be at the More Friends concert.
8824283	8824704	You know what?
8824744	8826525	I don't give a rat's ass.
8826565	8827006	Go to hell.
8827186	8827586	Go to hell.
8828427	8828847	All right.
8829868	8831249	Anything else you want to share with our listeners?
8831509	8833431	Not really.
8833451	8833651	All right.
8833671	8834172	Then I'm hanging up.
8834212	8836694	Go back to play some Guild Wars probably.
8836814	8837154	All right.
8837194	8837535	Have fun.
8837555	8838295	I'm hanging up on you.
8839336	8839436	Okay.
8839456	8839817	All right.
8839837	8839997	Bye.
8842086	8843347	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8868212	8871833	By the way, which also got brought up in there, before we go to break, we should mention this real briefly.
8872134	8873514	It's been mentioned twice in the show now.
8873594	8879256	MadCatz will be publishing Pump It Up, to which some of us go, Oh, God.
8879276	8884218	It gets the DMV size.
8886499	8887559	Exactly, exactly.
8888800	8891581	I just hope they don't fuck it up somehow.
8891681	8892841	I just blew our listeners.
8894082	8894742	I'm such a hoe.
8894942	8895222	Hot.
8896334	8897555	Alright, we'll be back after this.
8897655	8899336	More Potpourri here in this break.
8899376	8901096	Started off with one of Jamie's favorite songs.
8901296	8902117	I know this for a fact.
8902697	8904718	And we'll be back after this with more Orange Lines Radio.
8904738	8906259	The definitive list and the FUs of the week.
8906399	8907259	All when we come back.
8907920	8908300	Hurry up.
8908620	8909100	Finish your votes.
8909140	8910241	Last call for votes on this list.
8943944	8944828	Thanks for watching!
8989353	8990833	I just did not have love for you
9021953	9043352	I need to know, I need to know, I need to know how you feel I gotta know, I gotta know, I gotta know if it's real I need to know, I need to know, I need to know how you feel I gotta know, I gotta know, I gotta know if it's real I need to know how you feel I just didn't find my love for you
9044774	9057143	I'm giving all my heart to you, my love I justify my love for you I'm giving you my heart, my soul, my love I justify my love for you I justify my love for you I'm giving all my heart to you, my love I justify my love for you I'm giving you my heart, my soul
9076698	9077979	Music Music Music Music
9151279	9152621	Thanks for watching!
9182036	9182438	and many more.
9218511	9219332	Thanks for watching!
9242667	9243429	Thanks for watching!
9301864	9305185	The Orange Lounge Radio with the ping pong ball.
9305205	9305385	Woo!
9331581	9333983	Hi, we're back on Orange Lounge Radio.
9335264	9338848	I was just barking E3 quarters to DarkSakura there during break.
9340349	9340870	Sorry.
9341510	9342171	You know I love ya.
9343132	9344133	I'm just giving a heads up.
9344273	9345994	I do not want chaos like last year.
9346335	9348397	I was pissed off after that night last year.
9351989	9357411	I don't get... I don't... Despite my on-air persona, I don't get bitchy in real life that often.
9357451	9359152	But that got me really bitchy.
9359532	9361253	So just... You're funny when you're bitchy.
9362333	9365234	You are damn hilarious when you are bitchy.
9365254	9366695	Because I get totally faggy.
9366735	9367915	And I can say that because I am a fag.
9368235	9370536	I get totally faggy, you know, when I'm bitchy.
9370596	9372277	And just like, uh-uh, uh-uh.
9373337	9373597	Anyway.
9374598	9375238	Girl.
9375938	9377138	I'm just not going through that again.
9378699	9380700	I have that stuck in my head because I listen to...
9381545	9383206	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9402904	9407325	Let's reveal the definitive list as voted on by you guys.
9407385	9408886	Here it is, the definitive list.
9409306	9413267	Top things you want to see stuck on the giant Katamari ball at E3.
9413367	9417088	Number three, reject false icon sticker.
9417108	9420749	A very large reject false icon sticker.
9421709	9425670	Number two, a shitty Max 300 remix CD.
9427270	9430531	And the number one thing you would like to have...
9431345	9436366	Stuck on the Katamari Dimashiball at E3 is a copy of Katamari Dimashiball.
9436786	9438307	You guys are so ironic.
9438367	9438967	I love you all.
9439627	9444688	It's like Ray Yane on your wedding day.
9445288	9446288	A little too ironic.
9446828	9447348	Don't you think?
9448829	9450349	Yeah, a little too wrath.
9450949	9451249	Sorry.
9453910	9454410	But not really.
9455130	9457351	I'm sorry, but if you can have your gorillas thing...
9459775	9465218	Then I'm entitled to this little clip that makes me think of what just happened there in Listless.
9465998	9474082	You are such an Alanis whore.
9474803	9476744	Now you guys should hear Rob at karaoke.
9477444	9485128	He gets on stage and the question that passes through the entire karaoke room, Which Alanis song is it this week, Rob?
9486168	9486489	Cho-Chi.
9488169	9489830	It's like, yeah, yeah.
9518951	9522213	But see, and isn't it unfortunate, it doesn't have the same ring to it.
9522973	9529137	And then, that's funny, because the way that goes is that MPQ goes, that song isn't ironic, it's just unfortunate, and dudes go, it's not a tumor.
9532179	9532739	Girl.
9534280	9535541	I can't do it the way she does.
9535761	9537022	Oh, girl.
9537582	9538182	Girl.
9538923	9540243	Oh, girl.
9542765	9547648	Yeah, now that we've lost half our audience there, hey, at least we're not talking about the damn lawsuit anymore.
9547728	9547988	Okay.
9549607	9550708	Here we go, FUs of the Week.
9550728	9552008	And you have a new FU song.
9552568	9554969	You couldn't just stick with one, could you, DarkSakura?
9554989	9555529	You have a new one.
9555869	9558029	Because people butched about my last one.
9558129	9561170	I used it for other things on the show, so I found something more appropriate.
9561190	9561870	All right, here we go.
9562270	9564791	And Jamie, why do we do the FUs every single week?
9565591	9566311	Because we can.
9575797	9582485	What better to illustrate my wrath than to use Dan's ear, a.k.a.
9582565	9583886	the wrath of God.
9586229	9588031	Girl, I can't do it.
9588432	9591976	Okay, big F you to the bitches who broke into Rob's car.
9592877	9593237	Thank you.
9593457	9593978	You're welcome.
9597498	9604283	FU to missing out on homemade banana, not banana, coconut cream pie with extra coconut in it.
9604683	9607725	I had a bite of it that was hot.
9609747	9620074	And then FU to being so weak in Blue Burst that like one damn hit from the dragon put me down to four hit points.
9621035	9622135	I have to level some more.
9622516	9624997	You know, and damn expensive to play FOMORO.
9625097	9625838	God, you have to...
9626437	9634302	Buy this and buy that and buy your... And I miss my hacked item from the Xbox one.
9634362	9635843	I carry around a giant pink purse.
9637104	9637984	So I miss that too.
9638885	9639985	I want to carry a pink purse.
9641106	9641927	Eventually, maybe.
9645729	9646770	I miss how rap is too.
9647950	9649811	And F you to Loki's song.
9650672	9654514	Because it is annoying and I picked it just to annoy our listeners.
9654654	9655395	Because I love you all.
9656232	9656512	A little.
9658052	9659413	I'm not really too angsty, you know.
9659433	9660993	I've been in a fantastic... Oh, yeah.
9661413	9664534	An FU... This song gets really quiet, by the way, towards the end.
9665134	9666654	I'll have to pick something else.
9666674	9667314	I'm going to loop it.
9667594	9669915	Fuck you to having to pick another song, damn it.
9671615	9680317	Um... Oh, yeah, and an FU to FreeMP3Player.com or whatever it is.
9680597	9683578	Because now I have to wait for them to verify it again.
9683598	9683638	No.
9686258	9688760	My man wouldn't let me buy a mini-disc player.
9689720	9694143	You know, I think that there should be a PayPal account or something set up.
9694503	9697745	It's called the Buy DarkSakura, a mini-disc player fund.
9699747	9700587	Wouldn't that be awesome?
9701928	9702428	For you.
9702829	9703949	I need a mini-disc player.
9704990	9706211	Chatroom, you love me, right?
9707231	9708432	Buy me one, please.
9709133	9709613	Okay, I'm done.
9710734	9711854	Let's get to Loki's FU.
9711894	9712775	He actually sent me one.
9717406	9719767	I wish I could read these like Loki does his FUs.
9723789	9724349	Just kidding.
9725950	9729812	Loki's FU this week is towards German spammers.
9730452	9734554	I've been getting tons of German spam all day on my Yahoo account.
9736575	9737416	That's his only FU.
9738996	9741057	It's not as funny when I read them, I'm sorry guys.
9741398	9742178	But now it's my turn.
9746129	9750591	My FU goes to the little motherfucker with no balls that broke into my car this week.
9750651	9751151	Fuck you.
9751571	9754652	I got the last laugh in the end because that fucking stereo you stole was broken.
9755012	9756433	Fuck you for stealing my class ring.
9756453	9758214	I don't give a fuck if I hated high school.
9758254	9759494	You had no right to take that shit.
9759854	9762876	Why do people on this planet think that they can take shit that's not theirs?
9762976	9763456	I hate you.
9763556	9763896	Die.
9766275	9770516	F you to the fact that I wasn't able to take a trip to the Bay Area this weekend because I was kind of looking forward to it.
9770576	9772516	But there's just more important shit that's got to be done.
9772716	9774657	F you to all the stress that comes before E3.
9775037	9779498	F you to all the work that I'm going to have to be doing at E3 next week because I'm just supposed to go there and play games all day.
9779518	9782138	But no, I'm going to slave my butt off for you guys.
9782218	9787200	So, you know, I hope that you guys just kiss my ass after this because, you know, we're going to work it for you.
9788000	9788520	I'm just kidding.
9788540	9789380	I do it because I love you guys.
9789847	9791228	But damn, E3's a lot of work.
9791428	9797293	An FU to stress, an FU to the fact that I'm short on money right now because of a glitch and stuff I don't want to talk about.
9797734	9798394	Yeah, that's it.
9800656	9801517	That's my FUs of the week.
9801977	9803159	Let's get to the chatroom FUs of the week.
9808323	9810145	This is the Captain Jack cover of Holiday, by the way.
9811265	9817591	Mikhail Tov would like to give his first FU to his computer for randomly freezing when he's in the middle of Guild Wars or Phantasy Star Blue Burst.
9818055	9820878	Second FU is for that horrible American dad show.
9821398	9827584	The only redeeming factor on it, which isn't even enough to make me watch it, is Greg and Terry because they are adorable.
9827964	9830847	And finally, FU to my car making funny funky noises.
9833032	9840298	MPQ says, I somehow expect half the people to F you the Konami vs. Rockstar thing, so I'm going with something different.
9840658	9843640	Fuck Colors and 2DX, I will never beat that fucking song.
9844041	9848344	Oh yeah, and F you to kicking and screaming, total waste of money, I walked out, it was so bad.
9850085	9855650	Doob says, F you to Brazilian people who play MMORPGs because they can't speak proper English.
9856390	9862315	F you to being a high school freshman because when I think, yay, school is almost over, I think, oh crap, three more years left.
9862830	9864511	You just need to learn to speak Portuguese.
9864931	9867152	I think we should just stick doobs in a trash can.
9867813	9869413	No, because he's a Gorillaz fan now.
9869433	9871775	You know how we used to do to freshmen in high schools?
9871795	9873355	You'd stick them in a trash can, you'd can them.
9874036	9876457	We'd tell them that there was a pool under the gym.
9877778	9880519	And so they'd pass us to use it, and then an elevator passed.
9881419	9883540	Even though your school was on one floor?
9883921	9884581	We were two floors.
9885493	9888817	Oh, our school's only one floor, and people would sell elevator passes.
9889358	9894583	Ranma says, F you to my coworkers for screwing me out of my time off for an amazement on Memorial Day weekend.
9894964	9897026	Don't say shit when I put the screws to you.
9898267	9898828	Oh, girl.
9900610	9905756	Dark Knight says, a big F you to singlehood, and, um, that's it.
9908971	9918256	LemonLimeJump says, F you to the Domino's cheeseburger pizza for being really disgusting.
9918436	9920757	I could have told you that without eating the damn thing.
9922278	9924539	I think even those cheeseburger hot pockets are disgusting.
9924559	9925339	I don't know if you've ever had one.
9925359	9925820	They're gross.
9926860	9930062	I enjoy a good cheeseburger and I love pizza, but that thing's gross.
9930202	9930582	Avoid.
9933841	9938085	Uh, Ninst says, oh, no, never mind, he's, uh, sending me messages on PSO.
9938685	9942609	Uh, Jin4576 says, F you to Kingston, New York, Cyber Station.
9942889	9946172	Your DDR-EX machine is in such bad condition and you don't care.
9946632	9950816	The pad is on a tilt and you think that putting tiles on the bottom of the pad will fix it.
9951116	9955540	Here's some advice, get a new machine or actually try to fix the machine and not half-ass it.
9957998	9962440	And Illusion would like to say, F you to the whole tricky business with Konami and Roxor.
9962800	9964441	Did Roxor do something illegal?
9964781	9965021	Yes.
9965081	9966301	Do they deserve to be sued?
9966641	9966902	Yes.
9967242	9970083	But couldn't they have sued them a week after the game was released or something?
9970883	9972944	Fuck whoever predicted that F you, you jerk.
9973184	9974645	It wasn't Miklatov, by the way, Illusion.
9974665	9975365	It was the guy after him.
9976825	9977206	And that's it.
9977226	9978066	That was the last F you.
9979206	9980347	I just want to add to that, though.
9980447	9983068	You do know that lawsuits aren't written overnight, right?
9984477	9989621	and the rumor going around is that this thing has actually been planned for months and it's just funny timing or something.
9989721	9990062	I don't know.
9991603	9992003	I like that.
9992043	9994845	LemonLimeJump in the chatroom says, Reject Grote's Pizza.
9996407	9996887	That's good.
9997007	9997508	That's really good.
9998488	9998789	All right.
10000191	10006876	One thing we want to tell you guys about, because we're getting towards the end of the show, we're going to do some Ask Orange Lounge real quick, because we know it's kind of the E3 edition.
10007376	10010138	So send us your questions for Ask Orange Lounge right now.
10010158	10012039	We're going to do a quick break, then we'll come back and answer those.
10013040	10015921	What we do want to say, though, we have an email address set up.
10016082	10020424	Oh, actually, no, I've got to make one tweak to it, and then we will give you the email address.
10020585	10021165	I'm just kidding.
10021405	10023506	We will give you that email address when we come back from this break.
10023526	10024347	How's that sound?
10026408	10027329	Yeah, I'm with it tonight.
10028109	10029430	You are so there.
10029711	10031412	You know, you were just so on the ball.
10031572	10031873	All right.
10032353	10032633	Whatever.
10032653	10034035	You were on the ball, then you fell off.
10034055	10035736	We're going to take a quick two-song break.
10035756	10036697	Just a quick two-song break.
10036717	10038699	We'll be back with Ask Orange Lounge.
10039059	10045605	Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your Ask Orange Lounge question, and we will be back after this.
10045685	10049289	Start it off with a little bit of a... I think this could be an anthem song for Jamie.
10049609	10049849	Ooh.
10050430	10051471	It's Bad Girls.
10052952	10053072	Ah.
10053092	10053793	We'll be back after this.
10236095	10237716	Hi, this is Mel B of RTF.
10238077	10242981	And for an extra $1.99 a minute, my girlfriend Mel B can join us on all the fun together.
10243841	10249806	Hey, if you're a broke ass like I am, why don't you come to one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to and still the fun is just as great.
10250126	10251988	It's Orange Lounge Radio Sunday nights.
10252574	10257317	Kick it with me and you just might realize the best things in life are free
10278231	10279372	Welcome!
10279392	10279932	Welcome!
10280433	10286377	Melby, actually, he will not be joining the on-air staff because he can't because of where he is physically.
10286918	10292762	But he will be joining our news staff on OrangeLaunchRadio.com and bringing us news and articles and observations.
10293343	10299988	And unfortunately, this kind of comes at the cost of DDR Spot, the site he used to work for, is gone.
10300188	10300548	Bye-bye.
10300989	10301849	So sorry, DDR Spot.
10301869	10302069	Bye-bye.
10303130	10315033	I will hold on to my t-shirt forever even though it's three sizes too big so let's get to some Ask Orange Lounge we don't have a little bit of show left here so let's get to some Ask Orange Lounge
10332529	10334971	Question from the chat room, will Mel be on the show later?
10335431	10342575	He will be on the show as much as he can, but unfortunately since he lives like a well over a two hour drive away, it doesn't happen very often.
10342655	10343736	But we do appreciate when he's here.
10343936	10346497	We'll try to get him at least on Skype a little more often.
10347358	10348219	Give us some perspective.
10348559	10349900	Alright, here we go.
10356505	10363210	Let's Ask Orange Lounge Some stupid question What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?
10363570	10370496	Will we find out that we are so very tired because all this prepping for E3 has us really stressed out?
10374259	10376400	That's the most karaoke I do on this show, by the way.
10376420	10381364	Illusion wants to know, has anyone seen the movie Crash yet?
10382225	10382545	No.
10382565	10382605	No.
10383115	10384355	I have not, but I want to.
10384395	10388597	I've heard good things about it, because Illusion, you won't shut up when you tell me about the movie and you say it's good.
10388877	10394118	But actually, I think my roommate's family or something went to go see it, and they said it was very good.
10394378	10394998	So I want to see it.
10395218	10396399	And I saw the trailer, and it looked good.
10396419	10397679	I want to see Unleashed.
10398299	10401420	I was actually going to try and go see Crash like two nights ago, but it was too late.
10401560	10402701	Like, all the theaters were closed.
10403961	10404121	Man.
10406089	10411533	Doobs says, were you a jock quarterback giving swirlies to nerds back in high school?
10411954	10414676	Or an energetic cheerleader, as LemonLimeJump said.
10415276	10415997	I was neither.
10416117	10416978	I was a band geek.
10417118	10418119	I was a band geek too.
10418199	10421141	Not only was I a band geek, I was in yearbook and student council.
10421181	10423243	So I guess that kind of makes me a cheerleader.
10423443	10425805	I was on the chess team and on pep squad.
10426005	10428007	You have to remember that my role in...
10428849	10432070	Ranma wants to know, favorite Nintendo character and why?
10460746	10461786	Link, he's just hot.
10461806	10462186	Older Link.
10462206	10463047	That's funny.
10463067	10463207	Melee 2.
10463247	10466708	If they do Melee 2, I'm hoping that's like a surprise announcement at E3.
10466788	10467248	I would just die.
10491804	10498249	Um, now just tell me... LemonLimeJump wants to know, now just tell me, Liege... Is that a mistype?
10498289	10498569	I don't know.
10498869	10501931	Just tell me, just how do we know the Earth to be banana-shaped?
10504233	10505774	Um, I can illustrate that with sheep bladders.
10507575	10508716	Is that a Hitchhiker's Reference?
10509076	10509977	No, it's Monty Python.
10510017	10510697	Oh, Monty Python.
10512158	10512518	My bad.
10515220	10515761	That's it!
10516541	10517562	We have all the, um...
10518957	10520818	We have all the questions we got from our listeners.
10520998	10521978	That wasn't a whole lot tonight.
10521998	10522719	They're kind of quiet.
10523139	10523719	Yeah.
10523799	10524460	I was going to take that.
10524720	10527241	This one poor person has been calling into the Skype line like all night long.
10527261	10527701	Let's take it.
10527921	10530522	Well, I was going to take it, but he's not on now.
10530682	10531423	Person call.
10531743	10533223	You have one minute.
10533384	10534304	Maybe I should just call him.
10534564	10535164	Yeah, go for it.
10535364	10535785	Sure, why not?
10535805	10536505	We'll see what happens.
10539866	10540847	We'll see if he picks up.
10543608	10543768	Hello?
10543988	10544348	Hello?
10547270	10547550	Hello?
10551297	10554719	We're calling you because you've been calling us all night long and we felt bad.
10557380	10558320	Please say something.
10560201	10560401	Hey.
10560661	10561361	Hey, you're there.
10561501	10561822	Hi.
10563302	10563943	Hi, who's this?
10566964	10568044	RPGKing7.
10568304	10569745	Hello, RPGKing7.
10569785	10571126	Real quick, because we're at the end of the show.
10571166	10571666	What's on your mind?
10573917	10580243	Well, I was just wondering what DS games you're looking forward to hear about, sorry, to hear from E3.
10580603	10584787	DS games, Animal Crossing DS, I am all about the Animal Crossing.
10584847	10590712	If they have anything on Katamari Damacy, I'd be really curious about that too, but Animal Crossing is the one I have to see.
10591052	10594735	And anything that is online enabled with the DS, I would say.
10595956	10596717	I'd have to see that.
10597501	10620839	I'm sorry, Animal Crossing Animal Crossing DS will own anything and bless Nintendo because they're the only company that can get away with this crap repackaging the same damn thing and putting a new bow on it and we all eat this shit up and I am so excited about Animal Crossing DS and it's the same damn thing as before with, you know, a few new features damn you Nintendo, damn you how about you, sir?
10620999	10622140	what are you looking forward to?
10622381	10622581	um, I
10624123	10652186	Castlevania DS because it's the first time in a while we've had a real sequel to a Castlevania game I didn't even think of that I haven't picked up a DS yet but if it's good then it'll be what I'll pick up a DS for I didn't even think of Castlevania DS I definitely can't wait for that one The Konami booth is going to be so happening this year Oh my god, you guys don't even know the half of it Trust me, you don't even know the half of it How swinging that Konami booth is going to be this year So I'm excited Anything else?
10652446	10653247	Because it's the end of the show
10655846	10658407	No, just to say hi to you from up here in Canada.
10658587	10659768	Well, hello, Canada.
10660048	10660368	That's it.
10660968	10661288	All right.
10662068	10663249	Don't get too cold up there, okay?
10665669	10666330	We'll try not to.
10666390	10666670	All right.
10666690	10668610	It's always so cold up here.
10669071	10669371	I know.
10669411	10670351	I know those stereotypes.
10670391	10670811	Got to love them.
10671591	10676153	Well, I'm just going to walk on over to the beach as soon as we're done with the show here and run into some celebrities.
10676173	10678794	I have a date with Cameron Diaz after the show.
10679414	10679774	All right.
10680314	10680674	See you.
10681995	10682295	Bye.
10682615	10682855	Thanks.
10683564	10683884	DarkSakura.com
10699873	10708019	And if you've seen our pictures before, because they used to be on the website a long time ago, but if you've seen our pictures before, yeah, we all have blonde hair and blue eyes.
10708559	10709080	You're right.
10709160	10710521	Good thing I'm not from California.
10710541	10714524	But it automatically happens when you get your driver's license.
10716325	10719047	Yeah, it's this process they make you go through, actually.
10724311	10725952	Jamie, your final thought for tonight.
10729228	10733790	Um... Give me money.
10733810	10734230	Actually, I'm sorry.
10734250	10735030	I have one thing real quick.
10735050	10735230	What?
10735450	10736251	Okay.
10736491	10750277	If you want to send us an email, if you want to send us an email and ask us a question about E3, you have something specific you want us to find at the show, what you have to do is send an email to E3...
10751949	10755831	at OrangeLoungeRadio.com You've got to wait about two minutes.
10755871	10758592	Don't send it just yet because I'm actually creating the account as we speak.
10758952	10766194	Send an email to E3 at OrangeLoungeRadio.com This is the email we're going to be checking at E3 and answering the questions on our podcast.
10766215	10771597	So if you have anything you want to ask in advance or anything, send it over email.
10771637	10777519	Send it in a couple minutes and we will be reading those emails at E3 and getting responses to you via our podcast.
10777699	10780420	So you can kind of live vicariously through us in that sense.
10780987	10783329	I'm a mini-disc player and reject false icons.
10794989	10799012	You know, this whole thing is that happened with the lawsuit and everything.
10799072	10802974	It's all about protecting what is, you know, Konami.
10803014	10804615	It's protecting Konami's patents.
10805136	10810339	And it's all about, you know, what Konami, you know, came up with and everything and people infringing on that.
10812200	10816863	Very interesting, the kinds of things that, you know, were patented in this whole thing.
10817243	10817604	Very interesting.
10817624	10819905	It would be very interesting to see, like, all the different things that Konami's patented.
10821646	10822747	In regards to DDR, of course.
10823968	10824488	Alright, that's it.
10825120	10825941	Have a good one, you guys.
10826401	10827302	Final word of the show.
10827362	10830446	I guess since it's just me and you, I'll give it to you because I don't want it.
10838194	10843059	That does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live.

10869952	10873674	Yeah, I mean, it's okay to ask the big questions in life.
10874682	10876023	Don't expect any answers.
10876083	10880325	Yeah, yeah, don't take it all too... No, wait a minute.
10880805	10884006	You should always think... No, that's wrong.
10885447	10889929	No, actually, I don't think I've learned anything.
10891670	10893311	And that is a lesson in itself.
