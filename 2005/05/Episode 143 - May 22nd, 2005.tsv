265624	267865	Of course, lots of people there.
267885	271507	You had to push your way through crowds and stomp all over people to get to things.
271527	274849	You had to wait three freaking hours in line if you wanted to play Zelda.
275629	278931	And unfortunately, not all the cast members made it out alive.
279691	280091	Alive.
280331	283872	Yes, unfortunately not all of us made it out of E3 alive.
285312	287813	No, we'll have more details on all of that when we come back.
288133	293374	But I'll tell you what, tonight it is all about the music games at E3 and it was a hell of a show.
294194	298495	Surprises that just blew the roof off and smacked you up.
298715	303616	We'll talk more about that when we start the show after these opening credits.
304076	304516	We'll be back.

455257	456878	No, I'm kidding, she's actually not here tonight.
457518	459799	She died at E3, it's so sad!
462760	463781	No, I'm kidding, she didn't die at E3.
464721	488703	She just, she extended her vacation a little bit You see, some of us went to E3 a couple days before it started And some of us decided to stay a couple days after it was over So, Jamie is on her way back this afternoon, or I'm sorry, this evening actually from LA So, she's not here, but who is here is the one and only Loki I am here and I have pizza, that's always good
489757	491878	I did slash pizza and I got my Pizza Hut.
492618	498921	By slash pizza it means I drove my car over to the Taco Bell slash Pizza Hut Express and got myself pizza.
499221	500321	The old-fashioned way.
501662	502742	Not the EverQuest way.
503162	503563	Oh, hell no.
503583	506184	I'm not going to sign up for EverQuest just to get that lazy.
506444	508665	Besides, there's no Pizza Hut near my house and that makes me sad.
508945	511946	You know, speaking of EverQuest, this is completely off the subject, but...
512811	519758	I actually got to meet some of our quote-unquote competitors, although not really, because, you know, all of us online radio stations are in it together.
519778	520859	People in the same industry.
521059	522361	Yeah, people in the same industry.
522441	534493	I met the folks from MMO Radio, who talk about nothing but EverQuest and, what are the other, I don't even know, World of Warcraft and Guild Wars and all those types of games 24-7, so...
536897	544935	If you think it's weird that there's stations out there dedicated to DDR Just know that there's other stations out there dedicated to other types of games Anyway
546132	547933	We've got a fun show for you guys tonight.
548554	549514	It's just me and Loki.
549614	551075	We actually don't have any other guests tonight.
551216	554278	I know Rice Princess is actually here around.
554398	557940	She's watching movies with my roommate though, so I don't know if we'll be able to get her on.
558040	559441	She's watching Fargo.
559541	560502	Are they watching Fargo?
560542	562743	Why are they watching Fargo of all things?
563044	567366	I guess they want to, I don't know, watch someone get thrown through a wood chip.
567487	570028	How about watching a movie that wasn't really overrated?
570348	571089	That sounds like fun.
574180	575761	Alright, we're going to take a quick break.
575822	580945	Of course we've got lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots of E3 news to talk about tonight.
580965	584528	But we're going to start off with a quick break.
585129	589352	And in this break we're going to feature some music that was made big at last year's E3.
590352	590573	Okay.
590993	591433	From songs.
591794	597818	But what is neat about tonight, you guys, is that do we have songs from the new mixes?
598639	598939	Yes.
600137	603679	We have one new song to play for you guys from EX2.
604620	608903	And we have a bootleg copy of a song from Ultramix 3.
608943	609763	This is too cool.
610063	611224	I can't wait to hear how this turns out.
611244	613786	We'll be back with more details on that after this.
613886	615207	Started off with a little bit of your reign.
615247	615667	We'll be back.
631104	633043	Thanks for watching!
691459	693346	My resistance is waning
840066	841069	Thank you for watching!
1014645	1015625	Gaming Radio.
1015865	1020826	So uncensored that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.
1023307	1024647	Orange Lounge Radio.
1027228	1027828	Hello, everybody.
1027868	1029728	We are back on Orange Lounge Radio.
1029768	1034329	In that break, arguably one of the best remixes ever done for DDR.
1034729	1036429	Midi Head, in my eyes.
1036829	1044231	Before that, Junior Senior, Move Your Feet, Elvis Rubberneckin from Ultramix 2, and the Kiriyama Oka with Your Rain, the Rage Mix from...
1045017	1047059	DDR Extreme USA
1074181	1076262	Yes, we have a lot of E3 to talk about tonight.
1076302	1077782	Just Loki and I here tonight.
1078542	1079682	DarkSakura has the night off.
1079702	1081563	She's on her way back from LA right now.
1081643	1084824	Her and some folks from DRFreak went over to Disneyland yesterday.
1086384	1097107	I was actually originally going to go with them, but I had to back out at the last minute, basically, because I'm in a bit of a financial situation right now, so I couldn't afford to go to Disneyland, amongst some other things going on.
1097127	1097827	You're better off.
1097907	1099007	I mean, it's overrated.
1099760	1100681	All right, so...
1123891	1130214	How about a little bit of how was your week, how was your day, except for the fact that we're going to talk about E3 a little later.
1130274	1133896	So is there anything you want to share outside of E3 for how was your week, how was your day?
1133956	1134356	Loki?
1134456	1138738	Well, let's start off with, first off, we drove down there.
1138959	1140739	That was eight hours of fun.
1141320	1148303	And then we got there and we went and saw the More Friends concert.
1148323	1153606	Yeah, More Friends, More Music from Final Fantasy.
1154207	1156408	It was Snap, Crackle, and Poppin' Fun.
1156869	1157789	That's what it was.
1158070	1161211	I think that's the best way to describe the concert, was Snap, Crackle, Pop.
1161272	1161872	That's a good one.
1161992	1162993	Let's just put it this way, okay?
1163053	1169517	If you were to have, like, say, I don't know, they had complete retards working their audio.
1169837	1170557	That's what it was.
1171218	1175621	Because, you know, the singers would be singing, you can't hear them, or the mics wouldn't be turned on.
1176221	1179823	It's like they honestly got some tech guy out of high school to do it.
1180844	1182585	You know, it was awful.
1183360	1185081	As far as audio goes, it was cool.
1185741	1191824	The Black Mages were cool and everything, but it just wasn't mixed right and it didn't sound good at all.
1192125	1197187	Especially at the end where they combined the rock band with the orchestra with the choir.
1197908	1199268	It just drowned out everything.
1199368	1200589	It's just awful.
1202130	1203951	In that sense, but it was a cool concert.
1205312	1209994	And then we went to Arcade Infinity and I played the tambourine game, except it sucked.
1210447	1216910	Only because they didn't have the thing on the floor where it told you where to stand, so I couldn't tell where the sensors were, so I, you know, kept losing.
1216950	1221212	But I got to play Night of Fire on tambourines, and I looked like a complete dumbass.
1221372	1225034	It's just me or is the tambourine game the gayest game ever made?
1225314	1226395	And I can say that because I am gay.
1227075	1233998	It's exactly like some of the Amigo, it's just... But I mean, don't you look a little bit fruity playing that game?
1235059	1235519	I guess...
1237490	1238391	Trust me, I looked over.
1238411	1239913	You looked pretty fruity playing that game.
1240354	1240834	I guess.
1241395	1243657	Hey, okay, I had played Dance Maniacs all day.
1243858	1245339	I had to get my Dance Maniacs fill.
1245760	1253649	And after my hands started hurting from hitting the damn sensors on accident, I decided to just go ahead and play the tambourine game since it was there, you know, try it out.
1255718	1257439	And no, it wasn't good.
1257860	1258220	It sucked.
1286667	1289209	The one heavy metal song that was in that.
1289530	1291592	The only one I remember I actually really like.
1291632	1292252	I hate to admit this.
1292292	1294734	I really like the Vanilla Ninja song that's in Guitar Freaks.
1294774	1295175	I need to copy it.
1295195	1295775	I played that too.
1295955	1296216	Yeah.
1296776	1300439	But anyways, the heavy metal one that was completely obnoxious.
1300480	1301641	I played that about three times.
1302521	1303082	Really loud.
1303122	1305884	Because the Guitar Freaks there is really loud.
1306065	1308086	It's just extremely loud.
1308126	1313191	It's so unexpected coming from playing at Golf Land where everything's quiet.
1314224	1314584	Pappa Music Yo-Ha
1342071	1349234	So, finally I figured out the only way you can really pick from any song is you have to go into challenge mode, but that just kind of ticked me off that I lost a dollar because I didn't know better.
1350055	1351175	I also played a game of 2DX Red.
1351215	1352156	Did you play any 2DX Red?
1352496	1353076	Nope, don't play 2DX.
1353176	1355217	Oh, well.
1355557	1356518	It was fun, I guess.
1356898	1359479	I was able to play Injection of Love, and that made me happy, so.
1360940	1362641	What else did I play?
1364882	1365482	Nothing really.
1366062	1369724	They had taken out my Gal's Panic game from AI, so that made me sad.
1370525	1371165	And, um...
1372708	1375931	Yeah, really, that was all I played is Dance Maniacs and Guitar Freaks there.
1376691	1382656	I don't care to touch Poppin' Music just because, I mean, honestly, why are they making Poppin' Music 13?
1382796	1386399	It's just, it's the same fucking game all over.
1386499	1388521	It's just, oh, look, we changed it now.
1388561	1389562	It's a different theme.
1389682	1390823	It's got a... It's the same game.
1391223	1396427	It's got a rabid fan base and apparently it's still doing very well in Japan, so... I don't get it.
1396527	1397268	Don't know what to tell you.
1397288	1398549	I don't get it.
1399895	1400816	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1426311	1427772	To go to Hooters to eat.
1428652	1430573	I guess they were taping the Jimmy Kimmel show or something.
1430913	1434455	And just all these people were out there because, you know, free Audioslave concert.
1434775	1441479	And I'm going to be honest, guys, I didn't even know who Audioslave was, really, until I looked up and the guy was singing Spoon Man.
1441519	1443780	And I was like, oh, it's the guy from Soundgarden.
1443800	1444920	He must have like a new band.
1445221	1446461	And finally I figured it out.
1446481	1447182	I mean, how sad is that?
1447242	1451244	Apparently their new album came out that day and they were promoting it.
1451264	1451824	Oh, okay.
1451864	1453225	Apparently, that's what I read.
1453325	1453905	Oh, I get it.
1454841	1457663	But yeah, so we had to fight our way through a crowd so that we could go to Hooters.
1458544	1462006	Because they don't have Hooters in Sacramento, so it's a big deal for us to get to go to Hooters.
1462326	1463087	It was Hooterific.
1464007	1466149	And honestly, what's the big deal with Hooters?
1467810	1475415	I know I don't like to talk about local stuff a lot, but they're making a big stink about putting a Hooters here in Sacramento because they're saying, you know, oh, it's going to corrupt the children, no, no, no.
1476192	1476672	What's the big deal?
1476692	1479695	I've seen bigger whore waitresses at Chili's than I saw at Hooters.
1479735	1485259	If you want to talk about big whores selling burgers, look at the new Paris Hilton Carl's Jr.
1485299	1485839	commercial.
1485879	1486280	Come on.
1486300	1501211	Oh man, I can't believe that she's just like, did you know, and I'm not sure if you're aware of this, that's actually going to be on TV, and I saw this last night before they were, you know how they have the commercials before the movies and stuff?
1501611	1505694	They were trailering, get this, it was I Want to Be a Hilton.
1506112	1512655	It's going to be a new reality show where the mother is actually going to try to, like, it's refining, making them refine.
1512675	1515017	I'm like, yeah, and like your daughter's really refined.
1515557	1517258	Refined and proper, my ass.
1518418	1521400	So, yeah, it's going to be a new reality show coming to TV.
1521540	1522600	That's crap.
1522680	1525382	I wish the Hiltons would just disappear, honestly.
1525742	1526182	All of them.
1526462	1527623	Your hotels aren't that good.
1527663	1528423	Get affected by aliens.
1528864	1530084	Their hotels are not that good.
1530344	1532065	Actually, I stayed in the Hilton once.
1532105	1532605	It was nice.
1533939	1537321	All the celebrity sightings this year were from far away.
1537381	1541583	In combination of everybody that was in our group, I think we saw Gary Coleman...
1561385	1562265	Sinbad again.
1563326	1567007	We saw Jason Mewes and the Waynes Brothers.
1568148	1569748	At E3, not at our hotel.
1570028	1570989	At E3, yeah, right.
1571189	1573189	Our hotel, my ass.
1573990	1576851	Although, our hotel is a step up from Jersey.
1577171	1581052	So that's pretty much all that really happened.
1581072	1583713	It's just, you know, not too much exciting stuff, really.
1583833	1585854	Lots of walking, feet tired.
1586454	1587095	We're on G4 TV.
1589087	1601795	Oh yeah, if you guys haven't heard the podcast yet, which by the way, we were doing podcasts every day from E3, and you can download this at www.orangeauntradio.com, click on Orange Aunt Radio to-go edition.
1601895	1609659	We actually did live broadcast Wednesday, Thursday, Friday from E3, and I believe it's Thursday's edition we talked about this because it happened on Thursday.
1610520	1611840	We're standing in line to get autographs.
1612141	1613822	Yeah, we're standing in line to get autographs.
1614002	1615322	For my dad, okay?
1615403	1616063	It's for my dad.
1616875	1628185	I, you know, I'm not starstruck or any of that stuff, you know, it's not a big deal to me, but my dad really loves the attack of the show, because he's loved the screensaver since the beginning, so I thought, okay, that would be a nice gift.
1628205	1636392	Oh my god, if only this were like last year or something, and Leo Laporte hadn't been fired yet, then I'd be starstruck, but... Maybe me too, a little bit, maybe me too, a little bit.
1636432	1637894	Because Leo's awesome, Leo, but...
1638726	1664644	Anyway, so, yeah, we were waiting in line, and they were filming G4TV.com ups on their little, like, platform there, because they were doing a lot of filming at E3, and so they were filming an episode of that, and they actually were, you know, filming the line as we were waiting to get in, just for bumpers for the commercials when you come in, you know, they do a little, you know, talking over the picture and whatnot, but, um,
1665723	1669526	But they basically filmed us for quite a long time on that.
1670327	1670927	Actually, it's funny.
1670967	1674410	Somebody in the chatroom says, were you guys in one of the panning shots below the platform thing?
1674550	1675391	Yes, that was it.
1675891	1684078	Yeah, so we're down there, and we're in a couple of them, and I hear Brad and Irene are also in one for another show, too.
1684759	1689142	They were in the live crowd shot or something at the very end, so I don't know.
1689923	1690924	But it's interesting.
1691124	1691944	I thought it was pretty cool.
1694151	1701012	And I slipped them, Kevin and Sarah, one of our media samplers while I was there as well.
1701972	1711394	So we're trying to figure out if, like, he actually listened to it, which we kind of doubt, because, you know, people probably slip him all sorts of weird shit, and he doesn't, you know, he doesn't care.
1711854	1718015	So we're wondering if one of the interns is listening to it, or if one of the bums who found it in the trash out back ended up listening to it.
1718155	1718515	We don't know.
1721196	1721516	I don't know.
1722079	1725122	Whatever, but yeah, that was pretty much our E3, I believe.
1725142	1728405	That pretty much sums it up, other than actual E3 stuff.
1729145	1730306	Yeah.
1730406	1730827	Let's see.
1731608	1733529	What kind of stuff did I do over the week?
1733870	1745460	Pretty much the same thing, because we were pretty much hanging out together all the week, except I haven't had a car the past couple days, which kind of sucks, so I haven't been able to really go anywhere, because my car's getting repaired from the break-in when they stole my stereo a couple weeks ago.
1747467	1748728	Funny E3 stories.
1748768	1758072	I don't really have a whole lot to add to that except for me almost passing out because I had to wait for 45 minutes to get a damn hamburger in one of those lines downstairs where there's food.
1759032	1765655	Man, E3 is just so freaking crowded and they don't have enough stuff to handle everybody, it seems like.
1765995	1768716	I wonder if they actually put a limit on how many people can go to that.
1768756	1769556	They obviously don't.
1769897	1771197	It really seems like anybody can go.
1771957	1772438	Pretty much.
1772458	1775619	I mean, if Sinbad's in there, I mean, come on, Sinbad.
1776287	1798913	he's not in the industry nor is Gary Coleman although I could see maybe that he you know would get one of those legacy passes I don't know if he'd been there he'd get invites anyways Gary Coleman I think was in a game like a couple years ago it's possible I don't know but I don't know I think it's just kind of cool to see that they actually have interest in that kind of stuff though that's kind of neat
1800017	1801038	Where was Elijah Wood?
1801198	1805242	I thought he was this huge gamer because he was on MTV promoting the Xbox 360.
1806162	1807383	Where was he at E3?
1807824	1808724	That's what I want to know.
1810225	1810766	I have no idea.
1811547	1818332	I guess he had better things to do, more important than gaming stuff because he was such a hardcore gamer.
1821374	1821654	You know...
1822899	1835249	Apparently, I don't know if this is just a rumor or what have you, but one of my friends posted in LiveJournal about this, that the Xbox 360, because you got me thinking about that, that you couldn't really see the consoles at the Microsoft booth.
1835269	1837330	You couldn't see the consoles at all.
1837510	1839672	You just saw them running and you saw the controllers.
1839692	1840873	We didn't see the actual console.
1840893	1842294	Yep, the consoles were there.
1842434	1850260	But no, he said he looked into one, like he looked into one of the cases, and he saw a freaking Power Mac G5 in there, not an Xbox 360.
1850300	1850380	Yeah.
1851789	1856351	So isn't that ironic if there's some secret Apple and Microsoft teaming up thing?
1856891	1859732	Well, first off, yes, the G5 processors are in there.
1859832	1862153	Second of all, the test kits look like a G5.
1862853	1866875	And third of all, there were the actual Xbox 360s there.
1866915	1868415	They were just, it was built.
1868695	1869335	Some of them were there.
1869355	1876618	Pretty much it was like a, looked like this white kind of pedestal thing, and then there was a little cutout, and the 360 was in that cutout.
1877318	1878939	But that was it.
1879688	1887173	But yeah, they were actually there, and it was probably running off of development kits, which they've had the pictures online for, and they look like G5s.
1888054	1895139	They pretty much are G5s, but it's because it runs off the same chipset, PowerPC stuff, so... Crazy.
1895920	1896120	Yeah.
1896680	1898201	Did you actually get to play anything for Xbox 360?
1898482	1900943	Um, no.
1901083	1902364	I watched people play stuff.
1902444	1903085	I played one game.
1903125	1905166	I played that Top Spin 2, the tennis game.
1905987	1906928	I watched people play...
1908170	1908671	What was it?
1908711	1910773	Need for Speed, Most Wanted.
1911553	1912374	That looked pretty cool.
1914036	1915297	I also, what was it?
1915317	1917199	I was watching demos for different things.
1918240	1919841	But it was just like, it was cool.
1919901	1921282	I mean, it's really good graphics.
1921703	1929210	I did go online though and watch the rest of those, pretty much everything that you would have to wait in line for, for the PS3.
1929630	1930671	And that looks pretty cool.
1930691	1933714	Like they showed the new Gran Turismo game mock-up.
1934156	1943502	The re-rendered Final Fantasy 7 intro, the Spider-Man, Doctor Octopus stuff, and just the amount of details on there is pretty amazing.
1944483	1945143	That'll be interesting.
1946644	1947405	Okay, so...
1948075	1949776	Now that's it for How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day?
1949796	1951778	Because I have nothing really to add to what Loki had.
1951838	1954560	So, let's talk about the music games.
1955401	1958703	This is honestly the biggest year for music games of E3.
1958884	1959144	Oh yeah.
1959384	1968431	So, starting off, the big surprise that just blew everybody out of the water and people were like, OMG, it's finally happening, Beatmania USA.
1969292	1973935	Now Loki, I know you're not a really big Beatmania fan, but even you must have been impressed by this news.
1973955	1974456	What did you think?
1975571	1978574	I just thought, ooh, yay, it's Beatmania.
1979314	1980435	I'm gonna go play DDR now.
1981696	1988421	No, it was just like, I was hoping there'd be some different songs in there other than just, like, really old Konami originals.
1989061	1995206	But, you know, this is test location stuff, but it did look pretty good for test location, like, you know, the E3 demo version or whatever.
1995266	1997127	It looked pretty polished and stuff.
1998439	2006808	And honestly, I don't know why people judge that as the final product, because it wasn't... I mean, if anyone remembers Ultra Mix 2 last year and how much it sucked, oh my god.
2007188	2011413	But yeah, this... Yeah, and then Ultra Mix 2 ends up being one of the best games they ever put out, arguably.
2011433	2016418	Yeah, it's just, it's mid, you know, it's not even finished yet, it's just partial.
2016986	2018848	So it was pretty good for what it was.
2020731	2023735	At least the controllers will be hopefully cheaper to bring in.
2024175	2026598	That's something where everybody wins.
2026698	2033267	Even if you're not a fan of Beatmania in the US and you're against the idea and you're like, I don't get the point because I have every Japanese mix anyway.
2033766	2035087	And I heard that they're going to be redesigned too.
2055300	2067485	But I think it's some type of new pressing of the Japanese controllers because they still said on the turntable itself, I actually have a picture of them that I'm going to be putting in the Orange Lounge Radio galleries in the next couple days.
2067885	2070786	It actually says Beatmania 2DX on the little turntable.
2071227	2076469	So that makes me, because of the fact that they're not calling it 2DX here because there hasn't been a Beatmania 1 technically.
2076849	2080770	I mean, granted, we had Hip Hop Mania years ago, but I think they're just overlooking that.
2080790	2084252	Because, you know, obviously the new modes, it doesn't really need to be 2DX.
2085339	2086300	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2109818	2112381	It was interesting, though, because they were actually plugging Beatmania.
2112421	2116826	If you watch the little trailer, because Konami, at their booth, they show trailers for all the games that are coming out.
2117227	2123414	So, you know, you'd have the DDR trailer and the Beatmania and the Castlevania and the We are the Winx, We are the Winx, that trailer as well.
2123694	2124495	Those are all playing.
2124736	2130002	What's interesting about the Beatmania trailer is that it actually said, Bringing the Arcade Experience Home.
2130442	2133183	There were USA cabinets, though, but not for 2DX.
2133243	2134283	There was, remember, Hip Hop Mania.
2134303	2145687	Right, there was Hip Hop Mania, which I thought was kind of weird, because, okay, A, the game is not being called Hip Hop Mania, and let me be the first to say, thank God they aren't calling it Hip Hop Mania, because I, for one, would have been really disappointed if they did.
2145707	2149088	Well, they can't call it Hip Hop Mania just because it would confuse people.
2149108	2152449	How about the fact that there was no hip hop songs in the demo, really?
2152569	2158731	Maybe one, and that's a stretch, but most of it's trance, and they can't really call it Hip Hop Mania.
2159639	2160139	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2174621	2180624	That there was a song that's going to be in Happy Sky that's going to be in the US one also.
2181445	2183866	And it's a DJ Amuro track.
2184987	2192911	But I listened to the mp3 of it, or what it was supposedly, and it's not even a good fan-made one.
2193231	2197733	It has piano in it, so I guess that makes it a DJ Amuro track or whatever.
2198313	2198634	I guess.
2198674	2198894	Lame.
2199054	2199414	But, um...
2200467	2205048	I'm sure they'll do stuff like that because obviously they haven't listed any licensed stuff.
2205088	2207189	And you never know, there might be licensed stuff in there.
2208710	2209190	Possibly.
2209230	2214932	It's going to be a little weird for them to get licensed songs in there because of the fact that an artist is going to have to give up key samples and all this stuff.
2215232	2216092	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2216232	2217332	But it worked in Amplitude.
2217592	2219993	So there's no reason it can't happen because Amplitude has good stuff.
2220073	2222454	It worked in Amplitude and I'll see if the figure.
2222474	2225475	The other thing is they've got a good relationship with a different drummer.
2226141	2226401	Beep Maniac
2240397	2243378	Happy Sky, and you know, it was in already, Ultramix 2.
2243979	2245839	That would be a pretty easy sell, I would think.
2246440	2247060	Oh, we'll see.
2247780	2262086	Anyway, you guys, actually on our website, www.orangelonsradio.com, I actually posted up an E3 preview of Beatmania USA, and there's actually screenshots from the actual game and everything, so you can check that out, and as part of it, it actually has the song list.
2262126	2267428	If you guys want to check out the songs that are going to show up, these were the songs that were in the demo, but you know,
2267768	2271929	Granted, if they're in the demo, they're probably going to end up in the full game, 99% certainty.
2272330	2282413	The seven key songs you're going to see in Beatmania USA, Dancing Into The Night, Nothing Ain't Stoppin', I Was The One, Shining Polaris, and In My Eyes.
2282993	2288235	Now, a lot of people were complaining at E3 because the difficulty level was very easy.
2288795	2295597	In My Eyes was showing up as a flashing seven, but the note patterns were something you would see in a beginner note chart.
2296434	2299477	I guarantee you guys this is not the way the final release is going to be.
2299537	2300298	I guarantee it.
2300418	2301519	It's not going to be like this.
2302020	2304743	You're going to see the same level of difficulty you see in the Japanese mixes.
2304763	2307906	The reason why... Now this part I'm speculating.
2307946	2311430	The reason why it was done this way, I speculate, is because...
2313849	2319311	You've got people that have never seen this game before at E3.
2319571	2322973	99% of the people in attendance at E3 probably never saw this game before.
2323453	2325453	Probably only 1% of the people in attendance did.
2326454	2329535	I think it was something to make the game very easily accessible to them.
2330504	2331766	Thanks for watching!
2346814	2374371	anything that was in the demo now granted it's in light 7 mode but still all the songs on E3 appeared to be in beginner mode so even to have light 7 note charts in there I think shows you that there's more to come this is a very very early build just to kind of show off the game I wouldn't take anything in this too much as gospel you know what I mean so stop getting worked up over the fact that you know it was an easy mode
2376148	2388678	Um, let's see, also, if you put the game, now this is, this is where we get something really interesting and really different from the Japanese releases, and I think, honestly, this is a throw to the fans.
2389138	2396524	I don't, I don't think this is something they had to do, I think this is something that they did for the fans, is they actually put, in 5 key mode, typically...
2396884	2407170	In Japan, for those of you guys that haven't played these games before, in 5 key mode, it's the 7 key songs, but they just put the 6th and 7th key on autoplay, so you only have 5 keys.
2407650	2411792	And the reason why there is a 5 key mode is because the original Beatmania only had a 5 key mode.
2411812	2413413	It was a 5 key design.
2414534	2423679	So what they've done for the US release is they're actually putting, when you go into 5 key mode, instead of having 6 and 7 just be autoplay and it's the same list of songs, no, no.
2424412	2431477	You're actually going to get a completely different list of 5-key songs from the 5-key games.
2432117	2437440	So it's kind of a way for us to catch up on what we missed on Japanese 5-key releases.
2437841	2440883	So really, in reality, you're getting two games in one.
2441403	2441843	Kinda.
2442404	2442864	You see what I mean?
2447307	2457103	Labasanova de Febieng, Overblast, Hunting for You, Metal Gear Solid Main Theme, and Paranoia Max Dirty Mix
2460356	2465158	And I'm sure they'll have it where you can download, or not download, but they'll have more note charts.
2465198	2468119	I'm sure they'll open up in 7-key and stuff.
2468139	2471020	So eventually probably everything will be played all over.
2471040	2475902	It may have different note charts for 7 and 5 or something like that.
2477083	2478043	So it'll be interesting.
2478624	2479064	Yeah, so...
2480320	2481421	I'm very excited about this.
2481481	2483942	Now, again, this is a very early build that we saw at E3.
2484302	2486823	The actual release of this game is not coming until 2006.
2488684	2490344	So we do have a little ways to wait.
2490744	2492605	A lot can happen between now and then as well.
2493385	2499208	From what I'm hearing, though, it's going to be early 2006, like first quarter, but you never know what might happen with these games.
2499228	2500929	It could be first or second.
2500949	2505110	But I would say you're definitely going to see this game first half of next year coming out.
2505851	2506551	So it should be exciting.
2506891	2508992	Now, one thing that it's kind of getting slammed for...
2509975	2517025	is that the early press release on it, and the one sheet that was sent to the press about the game, states that there's going to be 50 songs in the mix.
2517425	2525296	And people are saying, well, if there's different song lists for 5 key and 7 key, that means there's going to be 25 songs in 5 key and 7 key.
2525316	2526137	That's kind of eh.
2527463	2531866	And I have to admit, if it's only going to be 25 songs in 7 key mode, that's a little bit eh.
2531906	2536088	So I'm hoping that maybe... Now, nobody said it's going to be split right down the middle.
2536208	2541512	I think one thing that could be interesting is perhaps there's only 10 songs in 5 key mode, 40 in 7 key mode.
2541572	2543133	I think that's something that's kind of feasible.
2544133	2544874	We'll see what happens.
2544914	2546194	And I think that might be a little more satisfying.
2546214	2549056	And also, I mean, it doesn't mean that they're going to be stuck in those modes.
2549096	2554720	Like I said, it's not going to take that much effort to make another note chart for...
2555740	2557702	One song that was a 5 key to 7 key.
2557742	2558963	I mean, it's not that hard.
2559063	2561305	It's just, you know, a little editing.
2561866	2563827	So, I don't see why that would be a problem.
2566950	2570213	So, anyway, it'll be interesting to see what kind of songs we get in this game as well.
2570293	2575878	Obviously, the interface is Night Styles interface, but we're seeing songs that date, you know, all the way back to early, early mixes.
2576699	2578120	Shining Polaris is what, uh,
2578775	2579315	5th Style?
2579415	2580876	It was on 4th Style Consumer.
2580916	2582116	It was a 4th Style Consumer track.
2582417	2583677	So that goes a little ways back.
2584697	2585978	Dirty Mix.
2586098	2588619	In My Eyes was a little bit, what, 5th Style?
2589019	2590720	I'm having a hard time remembering some of this stuff.
2590900	2591360	4th, I think.
2595082	2599043	We should expect to see songs from a wide variety of the different Konami styles.
2599663	2608347	What would be very cool, though, and I hope they do, and I don't know if they're going to end up doing this or not, but I'm hoping in 5-key mode we get at least one or two songs
2608905	2613866	from seventh mix or the final because those mixes were never released in Japan.
2613906	2618047	So if we got some of those songs, that would be very cool.
2618247	2621228	That would be a really nice thing for Konami to do for the U.S.
2621308	2626989	audience, I think, would be to give us at least one or two songs from seventh mix or the final to show that they care.
2627889	2628369	But we'll see.
2628689	2629250	We'll see what happens.
2630550	2630850	All right.
2631380	2631881	Beatmania USA
2648680	2651221	Let's talk about some of the stuff that was actually going on at Konami's booth.
2652341	2655822	It wasn't just a bunch of games being... Let me take that back.
2656182	2657663	You had the games being shown, right?
2657703	2661324	You had Ultramix 3 and Extreme 2 and Beatmania.
2661704	2666365	What some of you folks may not realize is that these games... I'm sorry, Karaoke Revolution Party as well.
2666846	2670727	These games were the center stage at Konami's booth.
2671087	2674388	They were the featured games by Konami this year.
2675345	2675565	Yeah.
2676085	2685629	Not only that, they had this huge setup with this light-up wall, and they called it Club Revolution, and these were the centerpiece games that Konami was featuring this year.
2686149	2703136	Not only were they featuring the games live on center stage, they actually hired, this is something a lot of people haven't talked about on the forum, so I want to make this very clear, they actually hired this dance troupe, this really famous dance troupe called the Groovaloos, to come in and do about 10 shows throughout the three days of E3, maybe a little more, 10 to 12 shows.
2708571	2721940	And they're also the same people that are motion captured for the dancers for Ultra Mix 3.
2722020	2724082	Yes, they're actually going to be motion captured dancers.
2724382	2728825	It's a little unclear which game because some people were saying Ultra Mix 3 and some people were saying Extreme 2.
2729085	2732187	I think it's Ultra Mix 2, I want to say.
2732568	2733028	You mean Ultra Mix 3?
2734096	2742604	No, I think they actually started with probably Ultramix 2, because if you remember, they changed the whole... They re-motion captured everything for Ultramix 2, remember?
2742624	2743005	That's true.
2743185	2748790	Well, regardless, one of the new games, maybe both, while we know, has the Groovaloos being motion captured on it.
2748830	2752154	So if you like that dancing in the iPod commercial, that's what E.M.M.I.
2752334	2755277	and the new characters, Blues and stuff, that's what they're going to look like.
2755657	2756638	I mean, it's going to be awesome.
2757239	2757399	So...
2758422	2759042	Thank you for watching!
2780615	2781796	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2804350	2805991	is that they highlighted all the games.
2806011	2810333	So they actually got one of the girls from the Groovaloos would sing like Karaoke Revolution Party.
2810653	2813755	One of the songs featured in Karaoke Revolution Party is Crazy in Love.
2814135	2816557	So she actually got up there and started singing from Crazy in Love.
2816577	2819678	And the other guy also sang, you know, play that funky music, White Boy.
2819758	2820419	But this is the thing.
2820839	2826682	Karaoke Revolution Party is going to have this new mode we'll talk about a little later called Sing and Dance Mode where you can sing and dance at the same time.
2827222	2832385	When she was doing the sing and dance, if you watched her, the dance she was doing lined up with the arrows.
2833064	2843414	So, in a way, even though she wasn't playing the actual game, they actually showed the video, the Karaoke Revolution Party video, I mean, they had it all synced up, and the dance she was doing was the exact same dance that was on the screen.
2843434	2844255	It was awesome.
2844856	2853804	So, my point, the reason why I'm telling you all this, those of you folks that said that Konami does not support their US audience can now officially shut the fuck up.
2854965	2857448	Seriously, you got served.
2858130	2858730	at E3.
2859231	2860891	The Groovaloos served you.
2861252	2861712	They did.
2862072	2862953	You just got served.
2863553	2873878	Konami has thrown all of their support by highlighting Karaoke Revolution Party, DDR, two of them, and now Beatmania.
2874618	2875639	All coming out in the US.
2876519	2884983	If you still, after all of this, think that Konami does not support their US audience when it comes to these music games, nothing is going to satisfy you.
2885504	2885884	Nothing.
2886960	2888640	So honestly, quit.
2889040	2889560	Just quit.
2890421	2892101	Nothing they do is going to satisfy you.
2892521	2893101	Go away.
2893921	2895061	We don't need to hear from you anymore.
2895281	2895562	Quit.
2895842	2896602	Do us all a favor.
2897262	2907844	Because it is obvious and apparent that Konami obviously invested a lot of money into this stuff and that they are throwing their full support behind these new games.
2908664	2910484	So shut up.
2912164	2915125	I wanted one of the songs that they were playing there and I don't know what it is.
2916016	2919438	Someone told me, though, that it was the music from one of the menus, which is pretty cool.
2919458	2924842	Yeah, actually, the very first song the Groovaloos did was supposedly some type of stage-like music or something.
2925102	2927344	I wanted it because I can remix it with no limit.
2927684	2934108	It would work perfect, but I can't find it because it's only in their little dance thing, and it makes me sad.
2934448	2935329	But it's all right.
2935609	2936070	Soon enough.
2937551	2942014	But anyways, what I was going to say... For the...
2943852	2951077	I know we haven't really touched on this yet, Extreme 2 and stuff, but this is kind of a little off the topic of Japanese DDR.
2951498	2955040	We had the little thing where they're saying, you know, oh, hey, it's a new mix.
2955100	2955981	Oh, the teaser thing?
2956021	2956521	Teaser thing.
2957022	2957462	It's Extreme 2.
2957982	2970611	Now, I know everyone is going, well, yeah, of course, it's Extreme 2, but we know this for a fact because the exact same footage, which they have still on their website teasing it, the exact same footage was in the intro for DDR Extreme 2.
2970651	2970691	So...
2972751	2973211	It's a fact.
2973312	2974793	It's Extreme 2 that they're plugging there.
2976694	2984901	There's obviously other information that we'll cover probably a little bit later in the show regarding Extreme 2, at least rumors and that sort of thing.
2985001	2987123	But anyways, DDR.
2987143	2987263	Yeah.
2988797	2990218	Actually, I think we're going to take a break at this point.
2990238	2991519	We're going to come back and do some DDR.
2991539	2998025	We're going to talk about Extreme 2, and I think before we come back and talk about Extreme 2, I'm actually going to play one of the brand new songs from Extreme 2.
2998105	2999346	This is a premiere.
2999406	3001307	I don't think anybody else has played this song yet.
3001648	3003689	So this is a brand new premiere for you guys.
3005331	3006332	I just have to find it here.
3007905	3008426	And I have played it.
3031275	3034476	We have some interesting things to say about Guitar Hero.
3034776	3035516	We'll get into that.
3036197	3037077	And what else?
3037097	3037917	There's other music games there.
3050427	3052308	Nobody even noticed, I think.
3052528	3054489	So we're going to talk about that all when we come back.
3056309	3058750	For now, though, let's get into the song from EX2.
3059291	3060291	Okay, this is the song.
3060811	3070095	This song is Naoto Suzuki featuring Martha, and the song is called, and I'm going to mispronounce this first word here, Polovician...
3071351	3073693	Plovzian, Dances and Chorus
3091670	3094552	And that's really all I know, is that it's some new game that Konami's putting out.
3094572	3095773	It looks spiffy from the video, though.
3095793	3096954	The video looked pretty hot.
3096974	3099276	It looks like a Castlevania-ish title-ish.
3099376	3104520	It'll be nice to actually hear the music since the bass that they had around there was a little too loud and I couldn't hear it.
3105360	3106181	So here it is, you guys.
3106381	3110224	World premiere for you guys here on Orange Lounge Radio from DDR Extreme 2.
3110584	3119451	This is the full version of Polovstian, and I'm sorry, I'm totally butchering that word, Polovstian Dances and Chorus.
3119631	3120472	We'll be back after this.
3123172	3126093	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3259920	3260268	Thank you.
3430120	3438731	Hiho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.
3438831	3444018	Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?
3444389	3447911	Alright, we are back, and that was one of the brand new songs from DDR Extreme 2.
3447951	3451954	The full version there, Palovstian Dances and Chorus.
3452434	3453474	So, should be interesting.
3453775	3456136	Now remember, that's going to be trimmed to DDR length.
3456176	3463000	So if you guys kind of thought, eh, it's a little bit repetitive there, and kind of gets slow in some parts, don't forget they're going to trim it so that it's more DDR friendly.
3463080	3467463	So you can kind of, you know, the fast parts there with the vocal, that's probably what you're going to see in the final release.
3467843	3472346	Honestly, I did play that song in the demo, but it was so darn loud at E3 that I...
3474585	3478847	I couldn't tell you what parts of it specifically are in there, sorry.
3480248	3483089	But I do remember it was fun and it had a pretty sweet video.
3483990	3491113	It's exciting that they're going to other games other than just Silent Hill for some of their music.
3491473	3493434	So Konami's tapping into some of their other games.
3493455	3494015	It's kind of cool.
3494575	3500498	And then we'll get into Ultramix 3, which actually has a song from Castlevania in it, which was originally in Keyboard Mania.
3500838	3501719	We'll get to that in a little bit.
3502759	3504400	So let's talk about some of the DDRs.
3505001	3508442	We'll start off with Extreme 2, since we played the song there in that break.
3508482	3514746	We will open up the Skype line in a little bit here for you guys to call in if you have questions for us about E3, some other things.
3515086	3516807	Let's talk about Extreme 2 first off.
3517387	3518187	What did you think of Extreme 2?
3518367	3519228	You got a chance to play it, right?
3519248	3520148	It was cool.
3520448	3520869	I liked it.
3521569	3522469	I'll probably be buying it.
3524030	3527352	What are some of the differences between Extreme 2 and Extreme 1?
3528593	3531154	First off, the interface went back to the old style.
3531894	3545424	Yes, now it doesn't, not meaning that it copies Extreme One's interface, but that Konami basically got the hint that you guys didn't like the interface in Extreme USA, so they've changed it back to that style.
3545544	3546565	The standard song wheel.
3546585	3549507	Yes, the song wheel that you guys are familiar with since DDR Max.
3549688	3549848	Yeah.
3549888	3552650	So, rest easy, it's gonna stick with that, so.
3553602	3555824	A lot more modes in this time.
3557004	3562388	I actually got to play the Extreme 2 in two different locations.
3562468	3568732	The first one being at Konami's booth, which had, you know, free play mode was the only thing available on it at the moment.
3569572	3572674	I was able to actually play a few songs on there.
3572714	3576756	Tried playing on, what was it, doubles and stuff.
3576776	3580719	But once again, Konami only had softpads, so...
3581488	3582389	That was no good.
3582729	3589132	And then I got to play again on the Sony Entertainment booth.
3589953	3591333	I got to play at the EyeToy support.
3591393	3593514	And by the way, there is a new EyeToy coming out.
3594075	3595335	It looks a lot smaller.
3595856	3596756	It looked pretty cool.
3597417	3603520	And I got to try the new hands and feet mode, which now is available in all difficulties.
3605421	3606822	Unfortunately, it hasn't gotten any better.
3608436	3610540	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3619746	3628210	I thought Hands and Feet didn't, or if you played it on Heavy, it did not have the hands.
3629070	3630871	I could swear there was a way you could get them in there.
3630971	3632452	It's been so long since I played.
3632672	3634933	But regardless, it's a lot easier to figure out in Extreme 2.
3635153	3636894	It's more logical, the way they have it set up.
3637594	3639675	They need to put it in edit mode, that's all I'm saying.
3639715	3642877	That's the only thing they need to do, and that option will be awesome.
3642937	3647579	Because if you can do your own hand motions and set up, you know, that would be an
3648308	3649149	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3670700	3671440	The iToy thing.
3671480	3675501	In fact, I don't think anybody mentioned the iToy thing at Konami's booth.
3675842	3679363	This was something more at Sony's end they were kind of whoring out was the iToy thing.
3679383	3680783	They had it set up in their iToy area.
3681323	3685325	The big push for Xtreme 2 at Konami's booth was the online support.
3685665	3688245	So this is definitely not a rumor anymore.
3688305	3693647	You will be online with Xtreme 2 because this is what they were selling is that you're going to be able to do the online mode.
3693927	3698969	And in the feature I'm going to do later this week, we actually have screenshots from the online mode that'll show you kind of what it looks like.
3701189	3705691	So, over at Sony's booth, I actually played In the Heat of the Night Heavy with hands and feet.
3706432	3708053	Huge crowd of people watching.
3708413	3709033	Did you see that?
3709073	3710014	Just like tons of people.
3710554	3714756	The reason why I was able to do In the Heat of the Night Heavy, because it has a very easy step pattern for a heavy song.
3714816	3716337	It's a very logical seven footer.
3716377	3719979	It's just, you know, you're just basically running back and forth on the pad.
3720239	3721480	So it's very easy to do the hands.
3721500	3723041	You just kind of throw up your hands once in a while.
3723821	3724382	People love it.
3725542	3726362	It's crazy.
3726502	3727943	Look at that fag go!
3727963	3728743	Look at it go!
3728763	3736986	I tried doing Undo-Twa on that, and once again, Sony Softpad came to the rescue and failed me, and here's why.
3737406	3749290	Because I was playing hands and feet mode, and it was pretty hard as it was to coordinate myself to do hands on Undo-Twa because it has a really strange step pattern to it, and then the damn pad stuck to my shoe.
3750254	3750854	Yay!
3751135	3752496	I love those softpads.
3753316	3756558	Honestly, Konami needs to make some better hardpads.
3757098	3765043	If not, I don't care if they're as good as the red octane pads, but please, so they at least have something else that they can demo at E3 next year.
3765984	3767425	God, I hate those softpads.
3767745	3769086	I hate them, I hate them, I hate them.
3769126	3771207	You can't play anything, you fail everything.
3771267	3771768	It sucks.
3771968	3772588	They suck.
3772708	3775630	I don't know how I got started on those pads, but they suck.
3777811	3778392	Give me something better.
3779685	3784350	Alright, let's talk about some of the songs that are actually going to be in DDR Extreme 2.
3784570	3789395	A lot of people very excited that Erotic is finally making its way into a US mix.
3790717	3797904	And this is very interesting, just because a lot of people, especially previously, were like, you know, well, In The Groove's the only way we're ever going to see Erotic songs at home.
3798445	3800167	And then Konami kind of pulls this one out.
3800507	3802329	Oh, nope, we're going to put In The Heat Of The Night on there.
3803024	3803324	DDR Xtreme 2
3825473	3827556	E-Rotic, In the Heat of the Night, of course, as we mentioned.
3827696	3829518	Genie in a Bottle, but it's a cover of it.
3829558	3832621	It's by the NC featuring NRG Factory.
3833042	3838087	So, I'm wondering if that isn't one of those Karaoke Revolution crossovers.
3838588	3838768	No.
3839529	3839849	Really?
3840130	3841091	It was kind of a clubby...
3841545	3842385	Sean Paul with Get Busy
3866784	3867885	Love and Liberty by Naoki Underground
3889584	3891526	Un De Trois, of course, as mentioned.
3891786	3893027	And then some other songs as well.
3893107	3898151	Can Be Real, Vision F, La Bamba from DDR Extreme, of course, showed up there.
3898471	3902494	A new song by Sotov called Saturday Night Love was in there as well.
3902514	3903614	I played that a little bit.
3903755	3905116	I didn't quite hear it, though.
3905176	3906036	Yeah, it's hard to hear.
3906316	3906817	Too loud.
3909739	3912481	Tons of characters are going to show up in Extreme 2 as well.
3912521	3915403	Did you see the new character select screen on some of the screenshots that are online?
3915423	3915503	Yeah.
3915762	3916182	Pretty big.
3916242	3917924	Crazy amounts of characters in there.
3918304	3928853	Rumor is, and I didn't see this, and I haven't seen this in the press release either, but I was reading in some of the forums, rumor is that it's supposed to have some type of store mode where you earn points and buy things with the points.
3929874	3930695	I guess.
3930935	3938682	I mean, that sounds sort of like the mode that they had in Extreme for the Japanese one, I think.
3938702	3940263	No, it wasn't Extreme, it was...
3942558	3944021	Thank you for watching!
3958024	3963826	One of the screenshots that actually we got in the press kit actually reveals some other songs that weren't in the demo.
3964226	3969708	And the other songs that weren't actually in the demo were Be Lovin' by D.Crew is going to show up in the game as well.
3969748	3972069	So you remember Be Lovin' from DDR Extreme.
3972109	3978051	And then Yuzo Koshiro featuring Julie Rougarde with a song called You Gotta Move It.
3978972	3981633	So those songs are going to show up in DDR Extreme as well.
3981813	3982673	So it should be interesting.
3985321	3993824	DDR Extreme 2 also having a Mission Mode thing in it, or I guess it's like Dance Master Mode, where you're kind of like climbing around this tree.
3994164	3998425	Again, these are things that were not available in the demo that they had at E3.
3998445	4001546	These are just things we're getting off the screenshots that were available in the press kit.
4002166	4006327	A very souped-up version of Mission Mode called Dance Master Mode.
4008008	4011309	And then just some, of course, new backgrounds and new screens.
4013415	4015216	New grading system.
4015436	4016436	It kind of clicks around.
4016477	4019798	It makes a little like beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, when it's scrolling through the different grades.
4019818	4021879	It kind of sounds like the Price is Right wheel or something.
4021899	4022259	I don't know.
4023019	4026000	And then there's an online play.
4026561	4028381	We can see the options on the screenshot.
4028762	4034304	Head-to-head, ranking challenge, practice, data options, and logout.
4034544	4041367	What's really interesting, though, about the screenshot, and I don't get this, but at the very top it says, 32 weeks from beginning...
4042054	4042555	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4055202	4055722	See you right there.
4055783	4056383	That's the shot.
4057144	4061027	Obviously, no, we can't... Yeah, I'm actually scanning through some of the screens... Whoa!
4061767	4062168	What was that?
4062208	4062708	That was weird.
4062728	4063008	I don't know.
4063889	4072576	We're actually scanning through some of the screenshots in the press kit right now, and you actually can see screens that are in that teaser that was on the Japanese site.
4072616	4073457	So this is...
4074187	4080132	This game, for those of you that are interested in what's coming next in Japan, it's going to be a port of Extreme 2, as if you couldn't figure that out already.
4080673	4084856	Yeah, and I just wanted to point something out here, too.
4085116	4088319	And I heard this, and I have to see it in my screenshots there.
4088779	4096366	But apparently, in one of the backgrounds here, we have a familiar little background.
4096386	4097687	I'm trying to find it here.
4098527	4102728	Thank God they didn't have the pictures of those people dancing with the eye toy like they did last year.
4102848	4104209	You've gone through all the pictures now, didn't you?
4104229	4104389	Okay.
4104529	4104929	Well, anyways.
4105689	4113772	Apparently, and I didn't see this, but apparently someone saw a video that was on a website or whatever and had the familiar dancing bears.
4114872	4117773	You know those familiar dancing bears from Romeo and Juliet?
4119414	4119814	Oh, yeah?
4120334	4121954	And someone thought that that song might be in there.
4121974	4123275	I hope not, because that song's not in there.
4123295	4125495	But I think, weren't they in the video to be loving?
4126256	4126976	I think they were.
4127520	4130523	So I think people are smoking crack, but, you know, whatever.
4130703	4131403	We'll see, we'll see.
4132404	4135747	All right, so that's going to do it for us talking about Xtreme 2.
4136067	4138389	Let's move on to talking about the other dance game.
4139110	4142793	Oh, and I'd like to mention the Xtreme 2 logo does look very nice.
4143233	4145315	It does.
4145395	4146756	I was very disappointed it wasn't purple.
4146776	4148117	Yeah, you didn't get your purple interface.
4148157	4149659	It's a very bluish green.
4149799	4152301	Yeah, it looked nice, though.
4152765	4155566	Alright, let's move on to talk about the other dancing game Konami was showing off.
4155926	4160007	They were not showing DDR with Mario at Konami's booth, by the way, but we will get into that.
4160027	4162688	They like to disavow all knowledge of DDR with Mario.
4162768	4168209	It's DDR Mario Mix is actually what they're calling it, and it didn't show up until you actually walked over to Nintendo's booth.
4168509	4169990	In fact, I have kind of a funny story.
4170370	4172191	We'll get into that a little bit, but let's talk Ultramix 3.
4172351	4174711	What did you think of Ultramix 3, Loki?
4175371	4175912	That was cool.
4176212	4176692	I liked it.
4176872	4177332	I played it.
4177748	4178629	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4197113	4197593	Thanks for watching!
4221291	4221871	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4248668	4250389	Some pretty cool new songs that were on there.
4251189	4253510	We have a new MidiHead remix that was in there.
4253710	4255230	Yes, and we're going to actually play that very soon.
4255290	4256791	MidiHead is going to do a new remix.
4256851	4259611	It's called Jelly Kiss, MidiHead Smack Mix.
4260792	4264693	Also, in Ultra Mix 3, we're going to have Akumajo Dracula Medley.
4264753	4268614	That is the Castlevania Songs compilation that is in Keyboard Mania.
4268894	4269594	It's crossing over.
4270115	4274136	I have been begging for this song for two years, and it's finally there.
4274256	4275036	I would like to thank...
4275940	4278801	I am directly responsible for this song being in there, but I'll just keep going.
4278821	4286104	And for all you people that were bitching and moaning before, yes, your damn stupid Max ripoff song, Sakura, is in there now.
4286124	4292827	Yes, Sakura is showing up in Ultimate Extreme, which has a lot of people bitching that it's not showing up in Extreme 2 yet, but a lot can change.
4293007	4295248	God, people, are you never happy?
4295408	4297709	Honestly, that song is just a stupid Max remix.
4298169	4299170	I mean, come on, folks.
4300479	4305381	You know, just because it's in Ultramix 3 does not mean it's not going to show up in Extreme 2.
4305601	4306342	We just don't know yet.
4306482	4307442	It's a limited song list.
4307943	4310104	Another song people have been bitching about for forever.
4310584	4313305	Finally coming to the USA after years and years.
4313765	4315126	Butterfly, SmileDK.
4315950	4317271	Which I had to laugh.
4317291	4318451	That was funny.
4319372	4321993	Didn't people say, oh, SmileDK hates Konami now?
4322013	4324734	Who was that freestyling Kyle Snyder's routine?
4324814	4327276	Lil B. Lil B. Yeah, he was up there.
4327296	4328316	That was funny.
4328916	4330557	So Butterfly is going to be in Ultramix 3.
4331177	4333278	Finally, like how many home releases is this later?
4333599	4334759	11 home mixes later or something?
4334999	4335740	We get Butterfly.
4336400	4337701	Breakdown would be for you.
4338001	4340722	Togo featuring Sana on Miracle Moon, LED light style.
4341082	4343003	Daikin Kai is going to show up.
4343103	4344624	You guys love to whore that song out.
4345066	4354396	Firefly, Destiny Lovers, The Legend of Max, Emotion, Kiss Me All Night Long, Eversnow, and Candy Star.
4354716	4356077	Pretty impressive song list so far.
4356218	4358140	Lots of songs playable in the Ultramix 3 demo.
4359041	4360822	Other things different about Ultramix?
4361263	4363045	There was a brand new freestyle mode.
4364186	4365147	Yeah, kind of interesting.
4365447	4366228	I got to play that.
4366784	4368847	Thank you for watching, and I'll see you next time.
4388593	4388913	DarkSakura.com
4407521	4409442	And they give you a grading at the end.
4409802	4411482	But you basically can do whatever you want.
4411622	4414923	And it's counting your calories as you burn, too.
4414983	4415963	So it's very interesting.
4416003	4418424	It's going to be a very neat kind of addition.
4418504	4419944	It sounded kind of lame.
4420124	4424445	And they give you suggestions like, why don't you try some hold notes or something like that.
4424465	4425506	And it was very strange.
4426046	4427526	That was something new that was in there.
4427886	4432688	And then the brand new thing, which is really strange, Quest Mode.
4432788	4433528	Quest Mode is...
4434927	4436648	More interesting than I thought it would be.
4437089	4447836	Quest mode actually seems very similar to the mission mode that's showing up in Xtreme 2, except instead of just this giant tree, you have this states and capitals map.
4448117	4455242	So you have a map of the states of the union with all the various capitals, and you start quest mode in Orange Lounge's home of Sacramento.
4455342	4455942	Thank you very much.
4456503	4457924	And that was done for us, by the way.
4458004	4458564	No, I'm kidding.
4458664	4463568	And what's also great about that is you have to pick up your dance crew, I guess, along the way.
4463588	4463728	Yeah.
4464128	4465709	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4485151	4485771	It's pretty cool.
4486152	4486432	All right.
4486812	4493395	So if you live in a state capital, you'll be able to play in your home ground on the quest mode in Ultramix 3.
4493955	4494255	All right.
4494975	4496176	Let's get into this.
4496376	4502799	We actually have an E3 bootleg exclusive, and you know this is Loki's fault.
4503059	4504039	Loki, what did you do here?
4504500	4512283	I recorded the MIDI head remix with this really crappy mic and a really crappy digital recorder that I have.
4513036	4519058	and therefore you get this really crappy quality recording but it's the only one you're going to hear unless you were there.
4520259	4521800	And we got to preface this.
4521840	4525821	The reason why we had to record this for you guys is the Jelly Kiss remix is very hot.
4526461	4527502	It is very hot.
4527522	4530843	Middyhead is incredible at his remixes.
4530923	4532684	He's so good at remixing the songs.
4533044	4535685	I played this song about 25 times while I was there.
4537003	4543745	So, honestly, I wish I had a better mix for you, because this doesn't do it justice, but it's still hot.
4543825	4550147	This will just have to kind of, at least you can get an idea, but trust me guys, this is a very crappy quality.
4550187	4552508	This is like crappy location test quality, okay?
4552908	4557610	This is like Beatmania 2DX test location.
4558317	4559678	with a microphone, okay?
4560058	4565602	At least I actually had a microphone and didn't just use the microphone on the tape recorder, because that would have sucked even worse.
4565702	4568444	Let's see how bad this is, because I haven't heard how bad the quality this is.
4568464	4569244	Oh, it's pretty bad.
4569564	4570425	All right, well, let's see.
4571045	4572566	I might have to cut this off if it's too bad.
4572686	4573267	No, come on.
4573487	4575028	You've got to play a minute.
4575048	4575508	Fine.
4575728	4577009	It's a minute and 47 seconds.
4577069	4581993	If you don't like the quality, you just turn down your speakers, but trust me, you guys, this song is so hot.
4582393	4587076	Jelly Kiss, Smitty Head Smack Mix, bootleg version, Orange Lounge Radio exclusive.
4587995	4588155	Ready?
4588255	4588736	Get down!
4588856	4589136	Oh, Julie!
4622094	4622534	and many more.
4673163	4677006	Honestly guys, that recording doesn't do the song justice.
4696730	4699991	But you could hear that the remix is really good.
4700031	4702132	You could at least get an idea of what it sounds like.
4702152	4703052	Exactly.
4703152	4709294	It's not great, but I tried the best I could to clean that up, and it just was not doing me any good.
4709454	4712875	Please don't base your opinion of that song off that recording.
4713095	4716836	That's really for the hardcore fans to whet your appetite a little bit for the real thing.
4716856	4719977	At least it gives you an idea of what it's going to sound like, and it sounded really cool.
4719997	4721658	When I heard it, I was like, oh, I've got to play this.
4722218	4723578	So it'll be cool.
4724439	4725039	Don't doubt it.
4725399	4725559	But...
4727025	4727466	Thanks for watching!
4736403	4738184	Wasn't much, but the mic was like $10.
4738324	4739544	I mean, come on.
4739604	4740445	Oh, yeah, the mic.
4740565	4744627	Oh, gosh, it was that same microphone we use for our podcasts away from home.
4744927	4745367	$10 mic.
4745647	4757052	See, like if I had professional recording equipment, actually what I would have preferred to do, but obviously I had no access to do this, would be to pull one of the audio connectors out of the speaker and actually hook it up directly to it.
4758473	4765756	Ideally, you know, if I had known somebody that worked there that would let me do that, that would be awesome because I had the tools to do that.
4766900	4769260	But yeah, right, like they're actually going to let me bootleg this song.
4770341	4772461	What you did was crazy enough.
4772601	4776062	I couldn't believe, because there was a Konami person that walked right by you as you were doing that.
4776542	4778442	I couldn't believe that they were cool with it.
4778462	4780102	I not only did that once, I did that twice.
4780122	4784383	Because the first time, somehow my erase button got stuck down.
4784463	4786604	So it got erased the first time.
4786744	4789044	And I did that, the first time was on the stage.
4789564	4790764	I did that right there.
4790924	4793765	So no one really cared, but you know.
4794652	4799156	I really wish I had a plug that could have gotten a game copy of it.
4800137	4804000	Some folks in the chatroom are begging us to put that bootleg copy up somewhere.
4804020	4805381	We'll have to think about it.
4807382	4812346	I really don't want people to think that this is what the song is actually going to sound like because it will be much better.
4812847	4815969	Hopefully, MidiHead, he likes to put these things up on his site.
4816029	4818371	Hopefully he'll do something for the fans over there.
4818792	4820373	We'll beg and plead.
4820993	4822735	Everybody go to MidiHead's site and beg and plead.
4823504	4824284	But he might not be able to.
4824505	4826746	Don't beg too much, because if he says he can't, then he can't.
4826846	4831648	I mean, Konami might be wanting to put this on a VRare later or something, so... Oh, it will be on a VRare.
4831668	4834910	Yeah, he might not be able to do it, so don't bug him too much.
4834930	4836191	If he says no, leave him alone.
4836931	4839753	But if there's even a possibility he might do it, bug him.
4842334	4842674	Alright.
4844406	4845327	Let's go to a break.
4845447	4848048	Let's do a break because we need to stretch a little bit here.
4849369	4853211	Just a rundown of the different modes that are going to be in Ultramix 3 as well before we get a break.
4853271	4867420	Party mode, freestyle, quest mode, workout mode, challenge mode, playing online, Xbox Live, training mode, edit mode, jukebox mode, which is something we didn't mention but it wasn't playable in the demo, that's why, but we imagine it's just the videos and nothing else.
4867680	4869061	Kind of like jukebox mode in 2DX.
4869541	4871462	And options, of course.
4872043	4873704	I love playing the options mode.
4873724	4873984	Yeah.
4874605	4882853	We're going to go to a break, and when we come back from this break, what we're going to do is we're going to talk a little bit about DDR with Mario, or DDR Mario Mix, as they're going to call it in the U.S.
4883234	4884355	We're going to talk about In the Groove.
4884595	4889520	I still want to talk In the Groove, and we want to get Loki's thoughts on In the Groove as well.
4890421	4897508	And Loki also tries a bunch of different hardpads in succession, making him very tired.
4899741	4901863	All right, yeah, yeah, that's, oh, yeah, we got to talk about that.
4901883	4906727	Some of the other Kenshiya Hall tour that we did, a little Kenshiya Hall tour that we did.
4907007	4918196	And I want to also touch on how I almost got in trouble a few times at the Infinity Gaming booth with their Feel 3.
4918416	4919177	No, we'll talk about that.
4920006	4932340	So, in this break, I thought what we could do is actually do some music from Ultramix 3, because we actually have a lot of the songs already in rotation on Orange Lounge Radio, our music program that runs 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and we're not here.
4932621	4936265	So we're going to play some of the songs that are going to be featured in Ultramix 3, in case you guys haven't heard them yet.
4937280	4941522	And should we also mention that one of our cast members is no longer with us?
4942362	4944043	Yes, we should mention this.
4944163	4948064	One of our cast members is no longer with the show.
4948184	4950845	They have been snatched up by the Katamari.
4950945	4955147	Yes, they have been stuck on the giant Katamari and gone forever.
4955187	4956387	And that is one of our ferrets.
4956727	4963370	And it's actually the ferret in question is the ferret that was broken and Loki actually operated on him.
4963931	4968575	It was one of the ones I operated on, and it's also one of Jamie's favorites.
4968615	4971397	The one that's all, you know, it's all, woo-ha!
4971417	4973419	Which made me even happier to get rid of it.
4973879	4974800	Sorry, Jamie, if you're listening.
4974820	4981485	So now we have old ferrets still here, but the new ferrets... We still do have one of the ferrets here, and this is Jamie's absolute favorite ferret.
4982606	4983927	So, he's still here.
4984467	4987370	Hmm, actually, that might be one of the old ones, or the new ones.
4987590	4989111	Isn't this the old school ferret?
4989171	4990632	I thought that was the very first ferret.
4990952	4991453	I don't remember.
4993044	4993864	Yeah, that might be the only one.
4993884	4994324	I think it is.
4994484	4994785	Whatever.
4994885	4995185	All right.
4995805	4997485	So one of the ferrets is gone.
4998166	4998966	I like our chat room.
4999426	5001487	www.orangeentrader.com Click on chat.
5001507	5002587	They're always hilarious in there.
5003267	5006468	Somebody in there saying, Dark Tetsuya, port of 40.
5009529	5010069	In memory.
5011230	5011530	Awesome.
5012170	5018372	We'll be back after this with DDR Mario Mix, In the Groove, Little Guitar Hero, our trip to Kenshiya Hall, and more.
5018632	5019072	We'll be back.
5024031	5025152	Music, Music, Music
5050366	5051087	Thank you for watching!
5078727	5084697	Yeah, Kaizenbo, Karlaienbo, Kaizenbosu, Kaizenbo, Kaizenbo Kaizenbo, Kaizenbo, Kaizenbo, Kaizenbo, Kaizenbo
5106346	5107987	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network
5302336	5303938	Thanks for watching!
5378283	5384108	Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio Because real radio makes Captain Jack cry
5391960	5398844	We are back here at Orange Lounge Radio and we're going to be talking about now DDR Mario Mix.
5398884	5401245	Loki, did you get a chance to play some DDR Mario Mix?
5401786	5404787	No, I looked at it and it looked like crap.
5405528	5411811	So, no, honestly, I didn't get to play it just because, I don't know, it just wasn't my thing.
5411971	5413172	You know, it looked a little easy.
5413232	5416874	It looked kind of very Disney Rave-ish and I just didn't want to touch it.
5418595	5419436	But it looked interesting.
5420016	5420296	Different.
5421861	5423782	Um, this is the thing about DDR Mario Mix.
5423802	5425462	They actually weren't showing this at Konami's booth.
5425502	5427943	You actually had to go over to Nintendo's booth to see this.
5428103	5434825	And what's really interesting is I asked somebody at Konami's booth, who I know kind of well, what's up with DDR with Mario?
5434885	5436805	And they were like, oh, it's a Japanese-only release.
5436985	5438466	I'm like, okay.
5438946	5440606	Then I walk over to Nintendo's booth, and there it is.
5440626	5441227	They're showing it.
5441267	5442147	I'm like, you lied to me.
5442507	5444027	Too many people lied to me this E3.
5444047	5445208	You're a dirty liar.
5445568	5447028	Too many dirty liars at E3.
5449309	5449729	But, um...
5451015	5451575	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5480439	5485642	I would say it was about the equivalent of a 5-footer, and I AAA'd it my first try.
5487763	5492106	So that's about the skill level you're going to see on DDR Mario Mix.
5492746	5494847	And I'm not one of those people that can AAA every song.
5495368	5498570	I've AAA'd some songs, but nothing that crazy.
5498970	5504513	So DDR Mario Mix is definitely not for the hardcore DDR player.
5505029	5512873	Unless you happen to be a fan of Mario as well, then you might like this mix because it's going to have a lot of songs, especially for you in this.
5514114	5524699	But as far as the DDR person that's looking for the next 10-footer and is hoping that it's going to be the star medley and Mario is going to be a 10-footer, I highly doubt it.
5524779	5526740	This is a mix that's going to be for kids mostly.
5529982	5532063	Let's look at some of the...
5533303	5535644	songs that are going to be in Dance Dance Revolution with Mario.
5536004	5538745	It was really, did you actually take a look at the song list at all?
5540025	5543246	Um, a little bit, not, very briefly.
5543406	5546687	But did you see any songs in there that weren't from a Mario game?
5546947	5547087	No.
5547267	5556930	Now I realize it's DDR Mario Mix, but with Nintendo putting this out, you would still think you'd get maybe, I don't know, a Donkey Kong song, or a Zelda song, or something.
5556990	5557150	No.
5557631	5558791	All Mario songs.
5560197	5582768	Starring Wario, Boo Boogie, Rollercoasting, Hammerdance, Blooper Bop, In the World Pool, Fishing Frenzy, Jump Jump Jump, Destruction Dance, Garden Boogie, Underground Mozart, Here We Go, Up Down Left Right, Always Smilin', Rendezvous on Ice, Deep Freeze, Cabin Fever, and Frozen Pipes are the songs in Dance Dance Revolution Memorial.
5583108	5586450	Also should be noted about DDR Mario Mix, um,
5587085	5587145	D.D.R.
5608593	5620257	There was one, it's very similar to Mario, or the one where you would... Actually, it was exactly the same as the one for the DDR Extreme, where you would run using left and right and hit up for a jump.
5621457	5623097	Of course, you know, with Mario, obviously.
5624758	5625158	I don't know.
5625378	5638222	Honestly, what I think would be kind of cool is later on when the next game comes out, which will be kind of similar to Donkey Kong's Jungle Beat, where it uses the DDR pad, but it's not a music game
5638922	5639925	Yeah, maybe.
5640447	5644299	So, I'm hoping, hopefully something like that will come out justifying this purchase.
5645004	5653366	You know, I don't want to knock this, because I think Nintendo has always been, they do a lot of kid-friendly things, so I think this is going to be a good thing.
5653746	5656426	I'm not going to sit here and knock this mix, because I think it's going to be a good thing.
5656707	5658627	I think a lot of the Mario music is very good.
5658707	5659947	I think it's going to be a fun thing.
5660287	5670009	I think if you have a lot of parties, and you have friends over that don't play DDR very much, this is going to be a mix that can really enable them to get into DDR a little more.
5670149	5673150	Nintendo knows one thing, it's how to make a party game, and...
5673587	5677851	So I don't doubt that one bit that any sort of party mode on that would be perfect.
5678271	5682214	So I'm not going to say, you know, DDR Mario Mix sucks because it doesn't.
5682314	5683295	It's just different.
5683415	5686037	It's not for you hardcore players.
5686257	5692682	It's for kids and, you know, people that, you know, are not familiar with DDR but maybe are Nintendo fans.
5692702	5696025	I think this could expose DDR to a whole new audience, which, you know, is a good thing.
5696205	5696646	Definitely.
5698407	5699428	Questions from our chat room.
5701699	5705962	So, does Nintendo have a release time frame for DDR Mario Mix?
5708904	5712826	We don't know of anything because we didn't get a Nintendo press kit.
5713246	5716829	But Jamie's in our chat right now and I'm wondering if she was able to schmooze her way to get a press kit.
5717509	5718870	We think by end of year.
5719530	5722352	Hasn't everything we've been reading saying like October, November time frame-ish?
5722872	5726514	By the way, Ultramix 3 and Extreme 2 are looking at the same time frame.
5726535	5728436	Will be released end of year-ish.
5729316	5730557	Definitely in time for the holiday season.
5732205	5734586	I do remember Nintendogs is out August 22nd.
5734606	5736046	That's one thing I did hear.
5736146	5742168	Nintendogs, by the way, on the podcast I named Nintendogs my favorite game of the whole damn show.
5742288	5743409	Nintendogs is going to rock.
5743929	5745049	I can't wait for that game.
5745269	5746650	It's going to be freaking awesome.
5748270	5748930	So cute.
5750451	5751271	I just love dogs.
5752852	5754812	No, but really, I can't wait for that.
5755772	5760434	Mario Kart Advance or not Advance, DS kind of disappointed me.
5761624	5765426	But anyways, let's see here.
5766906	5768287	I was just going to check real quick.
5768307	5769708	Check some of the websites.
5769848	5771829	See if we can answer that question.
5772749	5774670	Yeah, if I can't figure out when it's coming out.
5775670	5776891	Nope, to be announced 2005.
5777551	5778552	It's going to be out this year.
5779132	5782333	I would say bank on October, November, that time frame.
5782473	5785355	I think that's a good... It's got to be out for the holiday season, honestly.
5786055	5790417	By the way, if you're a Nintendo fan, another title not to miss that's coming out next month, Meteos.
5791278	5792059	Awesome puzzle game.
5792420	5793081	Awesome puzzle game.
5796365	5797707	Let's see, what other Bomani games are we talking about?
5797727	5798268	I think that's it.
5798368	5801733	I think that's all the official Bomani releases that are coming out.
5801793	5803415	So that takes us to the one of Bomani.
5805378	5806640	So down in Kenshiya Hall...
5807290	5808571	Loki, Kenshi Hall.
5808971	5810312	What did you think of Kenshi Hall this year?
5810812	5812113	Kenshi Hall blew.
5812233	5813814	It was a little weak compared to last year.
5813834	5816956	And a lot of that was because Game Infinity got promoted to West Hall.
5817296	5817676	Yeah.
5817696	5819658	So Game Infinity wasn't in Kenshi Hall this year.
5820978	5823000	But there were some interesting things there.
5823260	5823340	One...
5824401	5825021	GetUpMove.com
5843815	5847158	All they had set up were the metal pads and no TVs.
5847638	5850200	And they had boxes for In The Groove, display boxes.
5850480	5855644	They were kind of promoting In The Groove, but nothing to show.
5856545	5858446	So I was kind of like, well, that's kind of weird.
5858707	5859647	I was a little surprised.
5859687	5862470	I was like, wouldn't you want to show off your game that's coming out really soon?
5862930	5863490	And I asked.
5863630	5864651	I flat out asked the guy.
5864711	5865352	I said, you know...
5866263	5870907	I know there's things that have happened in the past few weeks that possibly have delayed the home release.
5871467	5873329	What can you tell me about the release date of the home release?
5873389	5881836	And he told me that he could say it was pushed back a little bit, but mid-June is the target release now.
5882576	5885318	And he didn't say it was pushed back because of what was going on.
5885358	5890322	In fact, the rep told me... Yeah, if I were to guess, I would say it's probably not because of that.
5890442	5894286	It's probably because of the USB support that they were trying to fix.
5895306	5896027	That would be my guess.
5896682	5897122	I don't know.
5897403	5900924	I think the people are saying it's because of Sony's delay or something.
5900944	5901224	I don't know.
5901505	5908288	We don't really know what the delay is, but we don't think it's related to the lawsuit anymore, which I guess I was proven wrong from last week.
5908388	5912150	I was convinced that this was going to delay the home release, but hey, I was wrong.
5912190	5912971	But you know what?
5913051	5919214	I also said I would love nothing more than to be proven wrong on it because I think the home release should come out, so it looks like it's coming out.
5920274	5922295	And from what the rep had told me...
5924834	5932882	They are going ahead with it because they feel that the lawsuit is more to do with the refitting of DDR arcade cabinets.
5933202	5940670	Red Octane was named nowhere in that suit, so they are proceeding with a home release because they feel that the lawsuit is strictly aimed at the arcade releases.
5941150	5943953	So they're going to release this sucker in mid-June.
5944273	5944814	My advice?
5945535	5946236	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5965928	5967450	Thanks for watching!
5982504	6010636	it's the rubbery parts that were inset were inset too far and they were too rubbery and they actually there's no it's good for sticking to the pad but it's not good if you want to actually do any freestyling or stuff on it I did not like their new pads I thought they stunk I would not spend my money on them and I would not even touch nor play ever again in the groove or in the groove 2 or any sort of incarnation of in the groove it sucked ass and I do not support it at all
6013066	6014123	Now tell us how you really feel.
6015248	6016649	Oh, okay, here's how I really feel.
6016729	6021791	I think that the interface is playing such a stupid port of Step Mania to the PlayStation 2.
6022071	6025573	So all you people that want to play Step Mania on the PlayStation 2, there you go, here it is.
6026033	6026593	Enjoy.
6026734	6030295	But as far as you're wanting original music, you're not going to find it in the groove.
6030575	6035898	In the groove is just a bunch of rehashed, really amateurish music that you're going to find there.
6036258	6038619	Oh, sure, there's some good licensed songs in there.
6038639	6039380	Good, play those.
6039420	6042021	That's about all you're going to enjoy as far as in the groove goes.
6042301	6044462	But hey, if you want something harder for you,
6044742	6046203	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6069788	6070188	You know what?
6071489	6072310	Let me just put it this way.
6072330	6073951	There's better music games coming out this year.
6074011	6074932	Don't waste your money.
6075212	6084578	I didn't have the... When I first played in the groove, I wasn't like, OMG, this is the best thing ever, but I wasn't anti-in the groove like you were.
6085839	6087340	But it grew on me.
6087540	6091663	I think you should give it another chance, because in the groove, it grew on me as I played it more and more.
6092748	6095670	I'm sorry though, but these people are going, Oh, it's not DDR!
6095770	6096671	No, it is DDR.
6096731	6097591	It's exactly DDR.
6097611	6099953	Yeah, I can't argue with you there.
6100033	6102735	It's very, very much DDR.
6103095	6106758	But the dance pads, I completely disagree.
6106778	6108199	I think the Afterburners are great.
6108479	6109700	I loved playing on them.
6110481	6113623	That's where I don't get it, because I thought they were great.
6113723	6115604	Okay, the Afterburners are an okay pad.
6115624	6118466	They just have a fatal flaw in it, and that's that they're inset too far.
6118967	6121348	Raise them up just a few millimeters, and you'll be perfect.
6121428	6122329	They'll be a great pad.
6122768	6129754	It's just right now, they're too far, so you're gonna... You're playing on them, it's awkward, because they're inset too far, and that's why.
6129914	6130594	I didn't like them.
6131035	6132716	I played on a lot of different hardpads.
6132796	6138100	There's... Trust me, there are pads worse than the afterburners there, and we played on those right afterwards.
6138121	6144145	Yeah, now, now, you... Even though you're knocking on the afterburners, what happened after you left Red Octane's booth?
6144165	6152172	You went to DDR Games' booth, and you played on that metal pad, which has a bar, by the way, so this would be great for you and the groove players, except...
6152725	6155106	Except the thing is flat and you can't tell where you are.
6155186	6156427	It's soft pad syndrome.
6156447	6158789	You basically float all over the pad and you miss stuff.
6159229	6161430	Not only that, but it wasn't very sensitive at all.
6161650	6163251	That's the other thing I didn't like about the Afterburner.
6163271	6164412	It didn't seem sensitive at all.
6164732	6169935	Now, I was testing it to see... Is it maybe just that the Afterburner was worn out from all the people playing on it?
6170175	6174478	It's possible... When I played at the premiere, I thought the pads were...
6175250	6176011	and Ristine.
6176231	6177672	I thought they were awesome guys.
6177852	6181094	My complaints with it would be that one, the arrows are rubbery.
6181134	6189920	They should be just like a metal type thing because honestly if you're playing with shoes you're still going to get grip but if you want to actually slide on them you can actually do that as well.
6190841	6193463	That I think would be beneficial for them.
6193603	6204871	The reason why that they're rubbery is that you stick too much and so it kills your ankles when you do that because it's just not quite like plexiglass and you get the same syndrome if you play on a pad that's sticky.
6205524	6205844	Who is this?
6205924	6207326	Hello, Dark Sakura, how are you?
6230067	6231167	I'm exhausted.
6231568	6232248	I'm tired.
6232268	6233808	I've been in the car all day.
6234128	6235249	Yeah, I know how that feels.
6235329	6237549	It kind of sucks driving in the car all day long.
6237589	6238389	How was Disneyland?
6239730	6241150	Disneyland was pretty fun.
6242591	6244951	They turned off the fast pass at Roger Rabbit, though.
6244971	6246032	That kind of made me upset.
6246112	6248192	But other than that, I went on Indiana Jones twice.
6248932	6249373	Very cool.
6249393	6251173	What was the best ride you rode while you were there?
6251873	6253654	Indiana Jones, without a doubt.
6253974	6254414	Heck yeah.
6254830	6259553	So we've been talking about E3 tonight, of course, obviously, that's what this show's been about.
6259873	6261274	What were your impressions?
6261294	6263076	No, we went to Timbuk2.
6263816	6265737	What were your impressions of some of the stuff at E3?
6266658	6270681	We've talked about Beatmania and the Konami DDRs, and we were moving into In the Groove.
6271341	6272702	What were your thoughts on some of those games?
6273883	6275104	Beatmania, of course, was great.
6275144	6278926	Actually, can you believe I got my first AAA on the stage in front of like a bajillion people?
6279046	6280227	Hey, good deal.
6282148	6286471	As far as the other stuff, of course, Katamari Damashii was cool.
6288012	6290533	Call of Cthulhu was really freaking awesome.
6290733	6300840	And I got to play Popokurus, which is a new... Agitech got the license on that one, and they announced it at E3, and it was pretty awesome.
6300860	6302741	It's a 2D RPG game.
6303001	6308745	For anyone who's into the import scene or into anime, they probably are very familiar with this one since it's very, very big.
6309586	6311087	I actually turned off the show.
6311107	6311948	Oh, maybe that'll help.
6332368	6332948	I already did.
6333949	6334869	I already did.
6334990	6349000	Well, I looked at the... Actually, I focused on the Mario one in particular.
6349020	6350121	I took a bunch of pictures.
6350141	6351282	They'll be up on the site soon.
6352786	6358890	But as far as the other... I really didn't get to play them because of the injury to my hip from my car accident.
6359390	6363252	I tried to play and it just ended up hurting way too badly.
6363552	6365173	Although I do like the new mix of Jelly Kiss.
6365193	6365834	That was pretty cool.
6365974	6367975	We actually played Loki's Bootleg earlier.
6368855	6369355	It wasn't so bad.
6369395	6370796	Did you say Loki's Booty?
6371036	6372177	No, Loki's Bootleg.
6373037	6373157	Oh.
6374778	6375759	We did not play my ass.
6375779	6377260	You broke up and it sounded like booty.
6377700	6379321	No, we did not play Loki's Booty.
6379341	6379681	Okay.
6380754	6383375	What did you think of... Now, did you go down to Kenshiya Hall?
6383415	6385956	We were just talking about some of the stuff we saw in Kenshiya Hall.
6386776	6387056	Yeah.
6387096	6388737	And Red Octane's booth?
6388757	6391277	The Red Octane's pads were ass-worthy.
6391417	6393018	I played on the DDR game.
6393078	6393378	Ha!
6393458	6394078	I don't get this.
6394598	6395579	I outvoted here.
6395799	6398260	I thought the Afterburner pads were awesome.
6398620	6399300	You know what?
6399380	6404381	If they wanted to do a good pad, then Konami needs to release the DX pad for the US.
6404922	6409163	Apart from that, I have not played on a single metal pad other than ones that are homemade.
6409858	6410739	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
6437780	6438321	RedOctane
6466238	6467399	I'm okay with people bar-raving.
6467419	6471681	Well, yeah, but that goes to the same people who complain about using speed modifiers on DDR.
6471721	6473862	If they didn't want to use it, they wouldn't have put it in the damn game.
6474203	6474383	Right.
6474923	6481467	Of course, when people say, well, you know, oh, it shouldn't be there, blah, blah, blah, you use your speed modifiers in 2DX.
6481487	6483768	What's wrong with using them in DDR?
6484188	6484388	Right.
6484509	6486230	And what's wrong with using the bar?
6486250	6487030	Because the bar's there.
6487991	6489551	Because it's a cop-out.
6489591	6490352	It means you're weak.
6492447	6496810	You are weak and you rely on the bar for your support.
6496830	6503173	You should stand on your own feet and beat the game yourself.
6503853	6507676	I got sunburned.
6508836	6517261	I put sunblock everywhere except I forgot that my neckline with that shirt is just a little bit lower than I was thinking of because...
6517879	6521420	I have this really cool shirt, but it sags just a little bit because it's just enough too big.
6522080	6523881	And so I didn't put any on my neckline.
6524121	6530422	And my shoulder was getting sore, and I thought it was from the shoulder strap on the camera rubbing up against my skin.
6531203	6533983	Turned out I was sunburned, and it's actually a little swollen.
6534003	6537324	Yeah, it hurts.
6537584	6539125	Did you do anything else in L.A.
6539145	6540325	besides Disneyland and E3?
6542159	6546120	Um... Um... We went to AI.
6546340	6548361	I played lots of pop-up music Iroha.
6548381	6549181	Mm-hmm.
6550181	6553202	Actually, I just played all the, like, Goonies and all the anime stuff.
6554662	6556863	I thought Iroha was a little overrated, but that's just me.
6558823	6564425	I played, um, the Beatmania 3 seventh final deal.
6564725	6565005	Mm-hmm.
6565425	6570226	Just because I was waiting for Iroha, and it was really hard to hear, and it wasn't all that much fun.
6570246	6570506	Mm-hmm.
6571509	6576451	Um, I also, uh, we went to Roscoe's house to chicken and waffles on Wednesday.
6577031	6582333	And I, I had been really good on my eating all day because I was going to have some grits and country gravy.
6583174	6585315	Believe it or not, the grits were substandard.
6586275	6586455	Aww.
6586515	6587315	Not good grits.
6587475	6591497	However, the chicken livers were pretty awesome and so was the turkey, the, uh, chicken gravy.
6592897	6593398	Okay.
6593538	6594518	I had fried chicken liver.
6595238	6598019	And say what you will, fried chicken liver's good.
6598039	6598960	It's like my comfort food.
6600666	6602727	I don't know, I don't think I'm brave enough to try one, but maybe someday.
6602747	6604527	I used to eat the livers all the time.
6605608	6606808	Did you sing anything at karaoke?
6607689	6608969	I actually did, believe it or not.
6609849	6618413	They had, you could choose Chinese, Indonesian, Japanese, Korean, and English songs.
6618513	6625015	And I actually went on the Japanese list and found the opening to Lane on the Japanese list.
6625055	6629057	There was a bunch of other songs that were sort of half new in Japanese, but this one was all in English, so I sang it.
6629837	6629977	Hmm.
6630501	6633464	If it was at the place on Thursday I would sing that one.
6636146	6637528	Anything else you want to share about E3?
6637868	6638909	Things you saw at E3?
6639169	6640230	Stuff you want to share with our listeners?
6640671	6643113	I saw the PS3 demo and the Xbox 360 demo.
6644793	6648637	and I took a bajillion, bajillion pictures of the Playstation 3.
6648677	6650599	The demos were pretty cool.
6650619	6656164	There's like a motocross game that had a pretty excellent demo to it.
6656344	6660848	They did a demonstration for the new Tekken thing with Jin and he was all sweaty.
6660868	6662290	I was like, ooh, sweaty Jin.
6662850	6664232	Yeah, pictures of that online.
6664432	6666113	I played the crap out of Nintendogs.
6667415	6668776	I played Frisbee with the puppies.
6669366	6670907	They have sweaty gin online.
6671927	6672167	Huh?
6672648	6674689	A picture of sweaty gin online.
6676189	6680211	It's on IGN and it's super big so you can see all the sweat and pores and everything.
6680711	6681992	Oh, hooray.
6683713	6684653	Are you on the site yet?
6684693	6685053	Do you know?
6685774	6686594	I haven't checked.
6686654	6688695	I've been home for all of two and a half hours.
6689155	6690796	We'll have to check some of that out and let us know.
6690936	6697339	It was long enough for me to post my picture, which I'm going to link in the chat room of the reject false icon sticker on Pac-Man's mouth.
6698280	6698660	Okay.
6701306	6704248	I put a lot of stuff on the Katamari.
6704588	6714911	I ended up getting four mouse pads and I gave one to Iguana Girl because she didn't get one.
6715512	6719493	I gave one to Julie because she was nice and babysat my big fat cat.
6721187	6722488	and I kept two for myself.
6722528	6723468	I'm going to take one to work.
6723909	6733413	I actually managed to snag three and I am going to give one to somebody but the other one I'm actually going to give away on the show at a later date.
6733854	6737155	Well, I've still got stuff to add to the bag of swag.
6737315	6737475	Yep.
6739719	6740540	I haven't.
6740580	6741980	Why don't you go ahead and tell them?
6742000	6744421	Well, we're planning on doing a contest.
6744441	6748362	We're not really sure how we're going to make you embarrass yourselves for stuff.
6748482	6751763	But, you know, a lot of this swag is going for bucks on eBay.
6751803	6754384	I found out those slimes are going for $40 a piece.
6754604	6755865	The what is going for $40?
6756205	6759166	The slimes that they were giving out at the square picture thing.
6759526	6759746	Oh my gosh.
6759806	6760186	Really?
6760206	6762867	Yeah, you can like just order them from Japan for like $5.
6762907	6764087	I'm going to sell mine now.
6765308	6767108	How much are those Beatmania t-shirts going for?
6767909	6768389	Oh, um...
6769147	6771430	I'll tell you what, we've got Julie over here on eBay right now.
6771450	6772972	Do you see any of the Beat Mania t-shirts up there?
6774494	6775515	Let me take a look here.
6775555	6776616	She's actually found one.
6777277	6777637	Oh my God.
6777657	6778919	Let me see how much it is on eBay.
6780359	6782521	Yeah, like I'm ever going to give mine to anybody.
6782681	6782981	I know.
6783081	6786805	I had people giving me pouty faces and puppy dog eyes.
6787485	6793651	I had people giving me pouty faces and puppy dog eyes for my Beatmania shirt, and I said, this is the one thing I'm keeping for myself.
6793991	6803520	Now, I got yelled at for getting a Karaoke Revolution shirt for somebody else, because I had this total bitch yell at me saying, you dug your claws into me to get that shirt.
6803600	6804440	I didn't even touch her.
6804480	6805681	I don't know what the hell she was smoking.
6805902	6807403	And then her boyfriend called me an asshole.
6807918	6810000	The DS trailer for Twilight Princess is going for $76 right now.
6810060	6810300	Oh my gosh.
6810340	6813823	Yeah, if you got a press kit from Nintendo, they actually have a DS cartridge with the Zelda trailer on it.
6813843	6815344	The Metal Gear Solid... Oh, what is this?
6830477	6831618	We're still looking for this shirt.
6832078	6835680	Someone put their stupid Tylenol Ouch shirt on.
6835700	6838922	We're giving out free massages at the Tylenol Ouch booth.
6838942	6841103	I had a really cute massage.
6841223	6845485	You know those glossy things that they were giving out for free at Konami's booth?
6846065	6847246	Metal Gear Solid 4?
6847506	6850148	Those are going for $10 a piece.
6851488	6852289	I've got two of those.
6852869	6853629	I have two of those as well.
6853649	6854390	Maybe I should put one on eBay.
6854410	6854570	Okay.
6855140	6856940	Or maybe we should put one in the bag of swag.
6856960	6864122	Yes, we're going to give away a bag of swag, which could end up being worth hundreds of dollars by the time... We don't want the promo.
6864542	6866062	We love Katamari Mousepad, $5.
6866162	6866362	Wow.
6866402	6871123	DS Stylus for Mario Kart, $10.
6871283	6874624	I will try to get a picture of the Beatmania shirt a little later.
6874724	6877165	Basically, all it is... I actually have... I'll tell you what.
6877585	6879345	I have mine still rolled up.
6879405	6880725	I took a picture of it in the bag.
6880885	6881185	Uh-huh.
6882066	6882886	And I'll try to...
6884232	6885713	We're going to dinner and going to see episode 3.
6885753	6888034	It has a little Konami one in the front over where your heart would be.
6888054	6888314	If I had one.
6888334	6889354	It's a freaking Beatmania shirt.
6889374	6889975	What more do you need?
6889995	6890295	In the USA.
6890315	6890715	It was really cool.
6910740	6922311	As soon as we find a way to properly embarrass our listeners to get swag, we are compiling a bag of swag for you guys, and we will send that to whoever the lucky winner is.
6922371	6931199	You don't have to go on eBay like some people do, because I'm laughing at whoever's bidding on some of this crap, although I'm sort of getting ideas now to take advantage of this.
6932881	6934822	And according to Julie, hardly any of it's being bid on.
6936361	6963259	I think it's kind of people are expecting more from eBay than they're actually going to get I went off earlier and people said in the chat room I was actually sounding like you because I went off for a few minutes on Konami supporting their US audience and what they did at E3 really shows that they support their US audience by bringing in the Groovaloos I was going to ask what was your opinion on the Groovaloos and what they were doing
6963911	6966333	I thought that they were cool, and one of them was on Roundhouse.
6967934	6969155	He wasn't actually dancing, though.
6969255	6970436	He was the MC guy.
6971057	6972358	Yeah, well, I remembered him.
6973118	6973438	Yeah.
6973659	6978162	I remembered, you know, once it was mentioned to me, I was like, oh, yeah, that is him, isn't it?
6980344	6982265	But no, I was really impressed with them.
6982305	6983126	They were great.
6984067	6989271	You know, and it was just even, you know, and there were people, you know, you know one of them won the giveaway?
6989711	6989971	Yeah.
6990812	6991993	And there were people complaining, and
6992855	6999379	I actually came back and heard about that later, about them complaining about them winning, but they don't work for Konami.
6999399	7002761	They were employed by Konami simply for E3.
7003702	7009365	You know that they actually ended up, the powers that be at Konami, ended up vetoing that win, and somebody else walked away with it.
7010045	7011046	Oh, that's really crappy.
7011066	7014228	Which, by the way, the most unenthusiastic winners ever...
7014881	7029530	By the way, Konami, not only did they bring in the Groovaloos, we forgot to completely mention this, they actually gave away every day a 30-inch high-definition television set, all of their Revolution games, and what else was it?
7030010	7030591	Was it DVD?
7030651	7034373	No, it was a sound system, a Logitech super nice surround sound system.
7034753	7038656	Every day they gave one of these away to the most unenthusiastic winners I've ever seen in my life.
7040564	7042265	Oh, I found my pictures of the Cybersex game.
7042405	7050647	This is just another example about how Konami supports their US audience because they gave away thousands of dollars in prizes to promote DDR.
7054289	7054549	Alright.
7056669	7061011	There's a 360 faceplate that someone got and that's going for $100 on eBay right now.
7061151	7063291	Yeah, I heard about that, the 360 faceplate.
7064272	7065852	Micro racers are going for money too.
7065872	7068413	Yeah, I saw those.
7069187	7071408	Anything else you want to share with us, DarkSakura?
7072589	7075711	Um, really, um, haha, we got to go to E3.
7077492	7079393	Um, no, seriously, it was really good.
7079453	7082375	I got very worn out walking all over the place.
7082435	7083796	Now I'm sunburned from Disneyland.
7085061	7092006	But in about two minutes, you guys should be able to check out the picture of the Beatmania shirt in my swag bag.
7092066	7096488	Somebody posted somebody else at the show wearing one, but go ahead and post your picture anyway.
7096649	7097789	Give them a nice chance to see it.
7097809	7099590	Mine's actually the rolled up one.
7099690	7105114	Also, my free copy of the Magic the Gathering online card game.
7105674	7106054	Oh, okay.
7107535	7110517	But I'll be tossing in a Katamari mouse pad.
7111704	7118106	and actually I don't have, I gave away my spare styluses so if you've got an extra or something.
7118786	7127048	But we've got some stuff that we can throw in the bag and I did, by the way, check the Nintendo press kit, which I did get a copy of.
7127368	7129869	There's actually autographed stickers in there by Miyamoto.
7130229	7130429	Oh, cool.
7130649	7134910	Were you able to look up, if you have a Nintendo press kit, I don't know if you have any information on DDR Mario Mix.
7135030	7135550	It's not there.
7135831	7136611	Oh, for Mario Mix?
7137051	7137231	Nope.
7138326	7139046	Have it right here.
7139066	7140587	Let me get to that page one more time.
7140647	7141747	It was really fast.
7142907	7143808	It got a large page.
7144168	7145968	Donkey Konga 2.
7146929	7147769	Okay, here we go.
7147789	7148629	I'll read you what it says.
7148729	7149690	I played Donkey Konga 2.
7150030	7151650	You know what song I played in Donkey Konga 2?
7151990	7154951	Headstrong, which is some rock song.
7155011	7157052	I was like, what the hell is this doing in Donkey Konga?
7157072	7157592	But it was cool.
7157632	7157892	Whatever.
7158352	7160453	Well, let me read the little blurb on here, okay?
7161213	7161413	Okay.
7161633	7167075	Mario must recover the stolen music keys before the unstable power of music destroys the entire Mushroom Kingdom.
7167771	7174893	Shake your thing to over 25 dance-flavored songs from classic Nintendo themes to familiar favorites and recover the missing keys.
7175233	7178694	With five difficulty levels, dancers of all abilities can get into the groove.
7178994	7181554	The special workout feature tracks the calories burned while playing.
7181594	7183575	Strut your moves and break a sweat to the beat.
7184275	7184615	No date.
7185575	7187936	But I do remember being told sometime this fall.
7188316	7190957	Yeah, I'm almost positive we're going to see October, November.
7190997	7193357	I have stickers autographed by Miyamoto in this thing.
7194658	7195338	I got to meet him.
7196078	7196438	Oh, did you?
7196458	7196578	Yeah.
7197237	7200380	I ran into him, well actually, he was actually walking away from Kanai.
7201441	7205444	I'm not going to be able to get the picture he sent us because we actually need to go because we've got to eat before going to the movie.
7205464	7205704	That's fine.
7205924	7206185	Alright.
7207025	7218014	But I did get to meet him and I got to, you know, actually we were about to collide so I said, and he looked really surprised and said thank you and have a good time.
7218034	7218394	Awesome.
7218614	7219155	Awesome.
7219724	7220305	Well, good job.
7220505	7222288	You know, um, did you get a chance to meet Togo?
7223049	7223489	No, I didn't.
7223870	7225372	Aw, I got a picture with Togo.
7225492	7225913	He was cool.
7226374	7226614	I know.
7226994	7232943	So, um... We are off to go see, uh, episode three.
7233103	7233944	Alright, have fun.
7233964	7236228	Um, but, uh...
7237566	7238967	I'm sorry, I can't be at this show tonight.
7239027	7242790	I only got back like... I have one more thing to add, Jamie.
7244051	7250757	It was just announced today on PSP Hacker that someone's working on a PC Engine emulator for the PSP.
7251858	7253579	PC Engine emulator for the PSP.
7254420	7255160	I've got to see this.
7256001	7257582	I thought you'd like that.
7257862	7261045	We're going to let you go, Jamie, but have fun at the movie, okay?
7261065	7263207	Have a good time.
7263347	7264128	Bye, everybody.
7264428	7265509	We'll see you next week, right?
7266549	7267110	We'll see you next week?
7267728	7269109	Yep, and reject false icons.
7269289	7269969	Alright, see ya.
7270750	7271030	Bye.
7271110	7271510	Bye.
7273171	7279354	Alright, that was DarkSakura, who's not here tonight, but she was able to bless us with her presence anyway, one way or another.
7280811	7283592	Let's see, what we're going to do is we're going to take a break.
7284733	7289275	Karaoke Party we still got to talk about a little bit because we haven't really, somebody in the chat room is asking about it right now.
7289315	7290255	We never really did get to that.
7290596	7291716	So we'll talk about Karaoke Party.
7291756	7295498	I want to talk about a new music game coming to your cell phone.
7296119	7297579	I hinted about this one earlier.
7297619	7299400	It's a brand new music game coming to your cell phone.
7299981	7302522	I'll talk about that when we come back after a quick break.
7303294	7304234	So let's do that break.
7304954	7310296	And we'll start it off with In the Heat of the Night, which is going to be in DDR Extreme 2.
7311076	7312316	And we'll be back with more.
7312696	7314557	This is just going to be a potpourri break, I think.
7315597	7319178	And we'll be back with more Orange Lounge Radio after this.
7320839	7321999	In the Heat of the Night

7698797	7700878	It's true, it's true, it's true.
7718348	7728351	We are back and we are going to open up the Skype line, you guys, so you guys can call in and talk to us and ask us questions and give us your feedback on what you think about the various releases at E3 as well.
7728732	7729772	So we're going to get to that.
7729852	7734414	If you want more details on how you can be a part of that, www.orangelongeradio.com.
7734734	7736194	Click on Interact With Us.
7736854	7745437	But first, I want to give you guys a few notes on some other little game releases that they had at E3 on some other games that are coming out.
7746518	7747198	Guitar Hero.
7747731	7752013	Guitar Hero, they weren't showing anything at Red Octane's booth to the public.
7752813	7759376	And in fact, when I asked about it, or when Loki asked about it, we kind of got the runaround just saying, oh, well, we'll have more information out soon to the press.
7759416	7760456	I can't say anything right now.
7761417	7767259	Well, turns out they're actually showing the game behind closed doors, and one of our staffers got back there anyway.
7768420	7770340	So we can't tell you about Guitar Hero.
7771381	7772721	Loki, I'll let you talk about this one.
7772741	7773902	You're a big guitar fan.
7774505	7777847	Well, this game, it's very similar to Amplitude.
7777887	7781769	There's actually some wonderful screenshots online right now.
7781809	7783109	Basically, it looks like Amplitude.
7783790	7785150	In the middle, you've got all your stuff.
7785170	7786351	It's kind of coming towards you.
7786551	7792094	I wouldn't say it's exactly like Amplitude so much as it's Amplitude and Karaoke Revolution kind of combining with each other.
7792114	7798817	Because you have to remember, Harmonix also helped with making Karaoke Revolution, so it's kind of obvious.
7799137	7802019	It's more like Amplitude, only because the stuff's coming towards you.
7803038	7804179	It's that sort of perspective.
7804300	7812410	However, it is like Karaoke Revolution because on the side, there's a meter that's kind of a crowd meter, very similar to Karaoke Revolution.
7813951	7815553	Basically, it's five keys.
7816314	7820199	However, depending on what difficulty you play, it's anywhere from three to five keys.
7821521	7822502	I thought that was kind of cool.
7823263	7840949	and now the songs that are going to be in it very similar to what Harmonix did before when they released Karaoke Revolution they were actually doing covers of classic songs they get these guys to go in the studio and re-record them same deal for Guitar Hero is what's going to happen same deal for Guitar Hero except for the ones obviously that are
7841343	7843184	You know, that BeAGuitarHero.com.
7843244	7844544	Right, BeAGuitarHero.com.
7844584	7853947	If you have a friend who's in a band who might appreciate some exposure from being in this game, or you're one of these people, have them go check out this site, BeAGuitarHero.com.
7854247	7859308	Now, considering how much you went off on Red Octane a little bit earlier, does this redeem them a little bit, you think?
7859708	7861209	Well, I wasn't going off on Red Octane.
7861249	7863709	I was going off on Rockser for the really crappy game.
7863749	7866290	Red Octane, they're doing no bad because they're trying to actually...
7866670	7870771	Distribute a dance game, which I give them credit for that, because at least they're trying to do something.
7871271	7877553	I wish they'd picked a better game, but hey, when there's nothing else out there other than DDR, what are you going to do?
7878713	7893057	But as far as them actually distributing this game, this is actually a very good move for them, because there are no other Guitar Freaks-type games, and I think this will actually exceed Guitar Freaks, which isn't that hard, since Guitar Freaks really hasn't changed much since Fifth Mix, so...
7894301	7900505	But hey, it's more of a challenge, and there is the same stuff in there that you would expect from Guitar Freaks.
7901506	7905148	And it looks like they've actually kind of got some hold notes in place.
7905388	7914934	And from what I hear, the controller, even though it is 5-key, it actually allows you to slide your hand along the different buttons to be able to hit them easier.
7915074	7918156	So it's actually like playing a guitar, which is nice.
7919617	7921078	And I managed to...
7922316	7927358	We need a little more information out of the guy when we're there asking him questions.
7927778	7929519	All, of course, very vague answers.
7929899	7936081	I asked him if there was going to be a drum hero type game, and they're all, we're working on something.
7936522	7941684	And also, so maybe a drum game coming soon?
7942264	7942684	Possibly.
7942804	7943284	Possibly.
7945325	7947086	So, that's something, and...
7948692	7953535	Definitely, there's some pretty cool shots, like I said, online, and we'll probably have some more on our website.
7953595	7956556	We're hoping we can get some more exclusive shots for our website very soon, we'll see.
7956976	7968002	And we're going to have those, probably, and it looks very similar to Carriker Revolution, just like, because you've got the CG guy on stage, the crowd, very similar, so it'll be interesting.
7968202	7968722	Very interesting.
7970287	7972049	Tycho Drummaster is available for your cell phone!
7992848	7994669	This is something that they were showing at E3.
7994729	8001232	Namco actually has a lot of cell phone games they're doing now, and one of their series they're pushing is Arcade Classics.
8001952	8012316	The folks at Namco Cell were actually very nice to me, and I've got to admit, and they didn't have to be nice to me for me to say this, but their cell phone games are pretty nice, considering that they're cell phone games.
8012636	8015498	I mean, in the end, they're still games on your cell phone.
8015838	8017679	They're not going to knock your socks off.
8017739	8021100	It's not going to be a Game Boy quality game, but for a cell phone game,
8021496	8022297	They're pretty cool.
8022437	8025619	And in other news, the N-Gage arena, empty.
8026019	8026440	Yeah.
8027680	8033044	The sad thing is, these Namco things running on Java on a cell phone is better than anything I've seen on an N-Gage.
8033445	8036947	And honestly, I did walk through the N-Gage booth.
8037007	8037628	I checked it out.
8037908	8040910	They're releasing a new version of the N-Gage, N-Gage 2, I guess.
8041070	8043852	I played Civilization on N-Gage and couldn't figure out what the heck I was doing.
8044913	8047275	It's just... It's interesting.
8047295	8047335	Um...
8048659	8057189	I know there are other competitors out there that are not exactly engaged and not exactly a Sony product that are portable, that are probably doing better than they are.
8058170	8062335	But hey, whatever, you know, they refuse to die, so at least let them try.
8062375	8062475	But...
8067325	8068426	Tycho Drummaster, how's this work?
8082362	8094204	I don't think this is something that's going to appeal to everybody, but, you know, for those of you guys that have wanted a music game to take with you on your cell phone, something to do when you're bored, Taiko Drum Master has a dozen songs from the original release.
8094804	8098725	Now, granted, it's a cell phone, so it's not going to be the same quality, but still, you know, it's something.
8099265	8106727	And it has the animation still and everything, and same types of rolls and combos and everything you remember from the original Taiko Drum Master.
8107047	8108047	This is available now.
8108567	8110989	They're saying, per their press release, it's available now.
8111289	8111810	So check it out.
8111850	8112931	See if your carrier has this.
8112971	8120658	I imagine it's not available through all carriers, but I do know I'm a Sprint user myself, and we do have Namco releases on our cell phones.
8120678	8122499	So I believe this should be there.
8122539	8123260	So I'm going to look for it.
8124481	8127584	I have, what was it, AT&T.
8128564	8130406	And I know they carry Namco stuff.
8130796	8131436	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8154190	8157052	That I was looking for movie tickets on Fandango, thank you.
8157793	8159354	And the picture cost me $7.
8159974	8161375	Thank you, AT&T.
8161495	8163176	I will never use your web feature again.
8163997	8170381	There's actually someone in our chat room saying that it's only on Verizon and available for a specific number of phones.
8170521	8173143	I didn't see anything in their release that indicated that.
8174524	8179187	But the lady at Namco was kind enough to give me her card, so I will write her and ask.
8180208	8181909	Maybe they're going to port it to others in the future, I don't know.
8182289	8183390	I will write her and find out.
8184013	8184613	That's what I will do.
8185334	8186914	Alright, let's see.
8186935	8189196	What else do we have?
8192077	8193698	What was the other game I wanted to talk about?
8193778	8195059	Karaoke Revolution Party.
8195099	8196439	Did you look at this at all, Loki?
8196719	8198320	I know you're a big Karaoke Revolution fan.
8198340	8199501	Oh yeah, don't you know me.
8199621	8200841	I'm a huge Karaoke fan.
8200861	8204523	No, I stayed far, far, far, far away from this game.
8206464	8207345	Yes, far away.
8207505	8208605	I did not touch this game.
8208665	8209846	I did not look at this game.
8210346	8213768	I stayed far away like it was my kryptonite and I was Superman.
8216209	8217190	XBOX, PLAYSTATION 2, GAME CUBE
8243038	8272078	GameCube will be getting a Karaoke Revolution release for the first time so that was kind of a big news right there you will be able to get this on GameCube a little bit unclear if the sing and dance will be in the GameCube version but they will get at least the sing part I think they will get the dance part as well we'll see some of the songs that were in it the only ones I remember were Crazy in Love Material Girl was in it because I actually did that one Endless Love Play That Funky Music White Boy
8275254	8276477	The interface has changed.
8276617	8282611	This is why they're not calling it Karaoke Revolution 4, but they're actually calling it Karaoke Revolution Party, because they actually went and did some remodeling to the interface.
8282947	8283727	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
8306317	8308378	Like, I know my material girl, okay?
8308698	8313421	So I was able to easily do the sing and dance mode because I already know the lyrics and the melody and everything.
8313441	8314341	I didn't really need the bars.
8314782	8318404	Because you have to, the way the dance mode works, it doesn't look like normal DDR.
8318544	8324267	If you've ever played Karaoke Revolution, the bars scroll horizontally across the bottom of the screen.
8324687	8325648	And then it guides your pitch.
8325888	8329850	Well, the arrows show up and they scroll horizontally at the bottom of the screen as well.
8330150	8331031	So it's a little different.
8333212	8333512	All right.
8334946	8336187	Dancing Stage Unleashed 2
8353869	8355130	Actually, last week.
8356350	8360372	Basically, for those who don't know, that is the UK version of Ultramix 2.
8361452	8365494	And pretty much it's the same stuff that we had on Ultramix 2.
8365674	8366974	Of course, new licensed stuff.
8367915	8374617	With stuff featuring, like, I See You Baby, which I have no idea what that is.
8374697	8375337	Hot stuff.
8376138	8377638	Hip teens don't wear blue jeans.
8377778	8381560	Is that that I See You Baby, Shakin' That Ass, isn't that song?
8382205	8382945	I bet it's that song.
8383005	8384185	I bet it is that song.
8384286	8407131	A Town Called Malice, Circles, Get It On, and Hanging on the Telephone, which, very interesting enough, we actually do have, well, DDRUK being the ones that are on top of the ripping of different stuff for the Sim scene.
8407491	8410892	So all the official stuff are already out for that, even though it was released like the other week.
8412699	8416171	So we'll have some of that stuff to play for you guys pretty soon.
8416693	8417998	And ICU Baby is...
8418849	8421592	The one you think it is, and it's a Fatboy Slim radio edit.
8421752	8423854	That's going to be pretty interesting.
8424955	8428238	But yeah, we'll have some of those songs available for you pretty soon, actually.
8428558	8428978	Sounds good.
8429038	8429779	Maybe even a show.
8429939	8435945	Also, I want to put out there that Song Pack 11, I don't know if it's out, but at least it's been announced that it's coming out.
8436925	8440469	I have not been able to get on Xbox Live in a couple weeks, so I have not seen myself.
8440949	8443551	I'm sure somebody in the chat room will correct me, however.
8444272	8444893	One way or the other.
8449027	8461197	Diamond Jealousy by Akira Yamamoto, Guilty by DJ Setup, Helpless by Teiko, Hold On Me by Tiger Yamamoto, and Open the PA by Akira Yamamoto.
8467054	8467534	Ishihara
8487846	8488967	Now can we open up the Skype line?
8489047	8489227	Yes.
8489347	8490087	Alright, let's do that.
8490127	8490848	Let's take some calls.
8490908	8502053	If you want to call in on the Skype line www.orangeloungeradio.com Click on Interact With Us and you can call us and talk to us and interact with us and ask us questions.
8502093	8513017	If you have anything you want to know about E3 or you have any comments on a lot of the various news that's come out lately because there's been a lot of freaking news lately go ahead and let us know what's going on.
8514078	8514738	Let's take a call.
8516943	8517924	Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.
8517944	8518264	Who's this?
8520026	8522007	Uh, this is RPGKing7 up in Canada.
8522187	8523489	Hello, RPG... I'm surprised you got in.
8523769	8528032	Hello, yeah, I'm surprised... Well, you've been hammering us all night, so I'm not surprised you got in.
8528313	8528853	No, that's alright.
8528893	8529614	What's on your mind, bud?
8532176	8534438	Um, well, I wish I had gotten down to E3.
8534538	8540663	I'm really jealous of you guys that you got to go there, but you live on the west coast, I'm out here on the east coast.
8541484	8542144	Well, here it is.
8542364	8545267	If you want to know what E3 is like, you're up in Canada, right?
8546068	8550513	Start walking to LA, and when you get to LA, you'll know what it feels like to be at E3.
8550533	8557801	Because you do nothing but walk around all day, and occasionally stopping to play a video game.
8560000	8561081	Thank you for watching!
8577052	8581533	It's pretty neat because what you get to do is it looks like Symphony of the Night.
8581673	8582353	It looks amazing.
8582433	8588555	Sound, I couldn't tell you because you can't hear a damn thing inside E3, but it looks very similar to Symphony of the Night.
8588615	8595176	Basically, you play on the bottom part of the screen, and the top part of the screen is typically what would have been your subscreen in Symphony of the Night.
8595576	8597977	You can flip it back and forth, though, between that and your map.
8598377	8602224	So that's kind of cool because I think that's sort of the type of game that DS was really made for.
8603345	8607172	Also what you do is as you move through the game, when you get to certain points...
8608155	8620323	You discover these magic seals And the magic seals are what you're supposed to do to defeat the boss So like the first one was very easy The first magic seal in the demo I played was just a little V shape You just draw a V, okay?
8620563	8635173	So it teaches you how to draw the seal And then what happens is when you go and fight the boss When you beat the boss, the seal flies up on the screen And you have to draw the seal like you learned it And if you don't do it, you don't beat the boss And I think you have to do it all over So, yeah
8636209	8637450	That actually sounds pretty cool, yeah.
8637490	8638411	Nice use of the stylus.
8638751	8644416	Yeah, and I think it's using the stylus without being kind of cheesy about it like a lot of DS games to date have been.
8645817	8651501	I think this will satisfy a lot of folks that have been wanting some new Castlevania that looks more like Symphony of the Night.
8652082	8655945	This falls right along with the Castlevania Advance games.
8656045	8657766	I think this will be a great addition to the series.
8659768	8661950	And it continues the storyline of Aria of Sorrow as well, so...
8662304	8665549	Yeah, which is really cool, because Arya of Sauron is one of my favorite ones.
8665809	8669234	Yeah, and somebody in the chatroom is saying it's actually due out at the end of October.
8669735	8675763	I would have guessed that it would have been out a lot sooner, because the game looked almost complete from what we saw, but I guess it wasn't.
8675864	8678928	But it looked pretty well done, so maybe they're just waiting on it, I don't know.
8680902	8691810	Yeah, I was excited to hear that 1998 and In the Heat of the Night are going to be on Xtreme 2 because those are hands down two of my favorite songs on the Arcade Mix's Xtreme and Fifth Mix.
8691851	8693392	I'm really excited to hear those are going to be on it.
8693752	8696674	Yeah, you could hear the giant hooray.
8697095	8698556	Well, it was kind of a mixed reaction.
8698576	8709104	It was a hooray and dope kind of coming from the crowd when you saw that In the Heat of the Night was on Xtreme 2 because the people that like Erotic, yay, finally we get Erotic, and then the other people that hate Erotic are like, nah.
8710206	8711904	But I, for one, am happy about it.
8713482	8715303	I also wanted to ask you about Phantasy Star Universe.
8715343	8717224	I'm sure you've covered a lot of this on the podcast.
8717264	8719345	I've only gotten to listen to the Wednesday podcast.
8719665	8720366	A little bit.
8720406	8721506	We talked about it a little bit.
8721666	8724828	I actually played one of them.
8724928	8726609	I think it was Phantasy Star Universe I played.
8726649	8728610	I heard they were showing another one in the Sega Theater.
8728630	8729070	I don't know.
8729411	8731712	I did play Phantasy Star Universe a little bit.
8732852	8735714	It's very different from the online.
8735774	8738115	The way it moves is very different.
8738676	8740877	A lot more action-packed.
8741557	8744219	I think than the previous Phantasy Star Online, at least the one I played.
8744560	8761834	I actually did a fight with a dragon, and I was playing with three other computer-controlled players, and I really couldn't get a sense of whether this one's supposed to be online or what the deal is, but the party I had was computer-controlled, and we were all just beating up on this thing, and it was pretty challenging.
8762535	8762615	Um...
8763351	8768776	A lot more action-packed than I think the Phantasy Star Online was.
8769677	8770478	Just kind of different.
8770918	8773261	Don't go into it expecting Phantasy Star Online 2.
8773341	8775323	They've changed some things in it a little bit.
8776023	8776944	But I liked it.
8777064	8778826	It was kind of fast-paced and I liked that.
8778886	8781028	I think there needed to be more fast-paced online games.
8781288	8782630	Oh, cool.
8783491	8787675	Because one thing I've always didn't like about Phantasy Star Online is it's a little slow.
8788665	8812582	at least in my opinion it's kind of slow I think you'll be satisfied with Phantasy Star Universe then they've really kind of upped the pace a little bit I also want to go to Kingdom Hearts 2 looks amazing I've been following all the games on GameStop and GameTrailers.com both of them have gotten really good E3 coverage over the few days Kingdom Hearts 2 I checked out as well did you play Kingdom Hearts 2 at all, Loki?
8813760	8814400	No, he's saying no.
8815081	8816381	Kingdom Hearts 2 I actually played.
8816441	8820344	They had two, actually four levels playable in the E3 demo.
8820664	8822104	Two boss battles and two levels.
8822485	8825926	And both were either the Mulan levels or the Hercules levels that you could play.
8826347	8828268	The one I chose to play was the Hercules level.
8828668	8830989	And you actually have Oren in your party when you're playing.
8831449	8836912	It has this new mode called Drive Mode, where I guess you're building up this meter as you're playing.
8837092	8838393	I couldn't really see how it was working.
8838433	8840034	But I had not one, but two levels.
8840523	8841524	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8868180	8869780	Zelda, Twilight Princess, just
8893519	8894219	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8917827	8922290	All I know is that it is Link that turns into the wolf because we saw an extra clip of that.
8922830	8924571	And what can I say?
8924731	8928093	It's everything you Zelda fam boys and girls are wanting it to be.
8928294	8929554	And I include myself in that.
8929875	8931075	I'm looking forward to the game myself.
8933537	8937340	It's the game they should have released three years ago if they wanted the GameCube to be super successful.
8937400	8939161	But hey, better late than never, right?
8939721	8939941	Right.
8940962	8941262	All right.
8941282	8943164	Well, we're going to let you go so we can get some other calls in, all right?
8943624	8944064	Okay, all right.
8944084	8945165	Thanks for listening to me.
8945285	8945885	Thanks for calling.
8946186	8946586	Have a good one.
8946606	8946806	Thanks.
8947944	8949945	Alright, so some E3 questions there, some various things.
8950225	8956487	I'm actually surprised I actually played all the games he called in to ask about, because I didn't play that many games.
8956507	8958208	There was a whole lot there I didn't see.
8958808	8964350	If you guys have any questions, you can give us a call on the Skype line, www.orangeloungeradio.com.

8971833	8972633	We like free things.
8972653	8973273	Free!
8973433	8974554	Alright, let's go to another call.
8974614	8975554	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
8976209	8977132	Hey Sky, Siggy here.
8977232	8978476	Hello Siggy, what's on your mind?
8979178	8981805	Well, I'm about to beat Mania USA.
8982046	8983310	I knew you'd have something to say about this.
8983891	8984092	Yeah.
8984693	8986794	Big credits to Jason Enos for that.
8987294	8987894	Absolutely.
8987934	8990635	You know, I actually had a chance to talk with Jason Enos.
8990675	8992275	We didn't get an interview with him this year.
8992395	8994616	I talked to him off the record about some things.
8994976	8997217	I don't want to talk about everything we talked about on air.
8998017	9001578	But one thing I mentioned was that, you know what, way to go.
9002158	9006059	I'm so happy that B-Manian is here and you're going to make a lot of people very happy with this.
9006099	9012601	And his response to me was something like, yeah, well, you know, I've been trying for six years and it's finally here, so I'm happy too.
9013757	9019060	So, absolutely, send Jason Enos some flowers if you kids are happy about this, because this is great.
9020501	9027546	Yeah, and when I saw the song list for 5-piece, oh, Old School Beat Mania.
9027866	9030728	Is that not a cool feature for us in the U.S.
9030768	9031128	to have?
9031368	9031988	Is that not cool?
9032008	9032729	Oh, hell yes.
9032989	9036071	I mean, what a way to acknowledge...
9036872	9037432	Thanks for watching!
9055583	9070493	Yeah, about, you know, I recently saw a picture on DDR Freak, someone posted the greetings for, you know, some Light Seven song, and like 167,000 points for a triple A, that's kind of ridiculous.
9071293	9078998	You know, I, again, I wouldn't, I heard of that too, and I saw that picture as well, and I triple A'd a song as well, I wouldn't,
9080118	9083320	Take those ranking things as gospel just yet.
9083500	9084581	It is an early build.
9084701	9088423	The thing was stuck in beginner mode, really, even though it didn't look like it.
9090144	9094746	I don't know how much they're going to futz with the grading system.
9094766	9095787	It's too early to tell.
9096827	9107813	I kind of would think they wouldn't touch it at all, and maybe just the fact that they were doing what they did by putting the beginner songs in there was what caused those mathematical things to come up with triple A's and what have you.
9108554	9108614	Um...
9109557	9111540	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9127228	9130410	La Bossanova de Fabian Shining Polaris Anything else you want to share?
9130450	9130790	Other E3 things?
9130830	9131230	Observations?
9131250	9132171	Well, just only Beatmania
9156710	9157690	I'm just happy with that.
9158210	9158451	I know.
9159091	9168333	A lot of us people that have been 2DX fans for a long time, and I've just been a casual 2DX fan, a lot of you guys are being very hardcore, a lot more hardcore than I am.
9168593	9171094	I think this is great that you guys are finally getting this.
9171434	9172694	All of us are getting this.
9175435	9178196	I haven't really been checking a whole lot of web forums and stuff.
9178276	9179776	What has the reaction to this been?
9179816	9182717	Has it been overwhelmingly positive, like about time?
9183317	9185238	Or are the skeptics already ready to
9185899	9188881	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
9211500	9238677	what they were able to do with this is that they were actually able to kind of set the standard the way they wanted to by unveiling this at E3 and showing us all these cool new features I think if they had announced this a month ago and said we are going to show this at E3 and I think this is the reason why this didn't happen people would have made up what they wanted to be in the game and they would have been disappointed when they didn't get that
9239461	9248449	So I think by Konami unveiling it, you know, by keeping it a secret and then unveiling it at the very end and showing this is what you are going to get, look at all these amazing things, it kind of curved that a little bit.
9248609	9250811	And I think it kind of helped the reaction overall.
9251051	9253273	So I can't blame Konami at all for trying to keep this a secret.
9253353	9253713	And they did.
9253933	9256075	This obviously has been worked on for quite some time.
9257596	9263258	Um, actually, something we were actually clued in on, but we wanted to keep it a secret, but I can talk about it now.
9263638	9270880	I gave you guys a hint last week about it, though, but actually, Konami registered the patent for Beatmania some time ago in the US.
9270900	9271701	Oh yeah, I read that.
9272001	9281304	Yeah, yeah, so, um, I, somebody had asked me to talk about it on this show, but kind of knowing that Konami, um,
9281964	9289171	If they were going to put out this game, would want to keep it a secret, I decided, or we all decided really, that we should just kind of wait and see what happens with it.
9289732	9291433	Because otherwise people will just start making stuff up.
9291974	9296878	So, it's a good thing.
9300542	9301543	Well, anything else you want to share?
9303024	9304225	Well, nothing much else.
9305273	9313778	I just want to share something, one of our comments in the chatroom, MPQ says, no matter how much it sucks, buy it, just so Konami knows people will buy Beatmania here.
9314999	9325326	Oh yeah, about the controller, the US release of the controller, were you the one who mentioned some improvements that would happen?
9326192	9327593	and DarkSakura.com
9349851	9352094	I think we will see some improvements made to the controller.
9352495	9357642	Because they're going to have to redo the controller anyway to get the 2DX logo off the turntable.
9358363	9360987	So why not fix the sticky key thing while you're at it?
9361287	9363751	I would say that we're going to see some improvements.
9364335	9373477	It would be nice if they put microswitches on it, like cheap microswitches, not exactly from the arcade type of microswitches, you know, prevent the sticking.
9373677	9378678	That's an interesting thought, completely change the way that the buttons, kind of, the sensor system, basically.
9379138	9383039	So, I'll be interesting, I'd be interested to see that.
9384079	9388680	Yeah, and if they do put microswitches, I would buy it, I would buy it, definitely.
9390239	9416925	I think what's interesting is that a lot of I need a new 2DX controller very badly for my import copies but now that I've heard that Beatmania is coming out in the USA I'm just kind of going to wait for the US controllers to come out because there's no sense in paying $100 to import a controller now when they're going to release them here probably $40-$50 I don't know, don't take my word on that who knows how much these things are going to cost but it'll be cheaper than importing it, that's for sure
9419006	9432676	Speaking of beat me, setting that aside, about PlayStation 3, I read from either IGN or GameSpot that they have 6 USB ports, are they really replacing the old controller port for that?
9433957	9435278	I didn't read up on PS3.
9435298	9435919	What do you know about this?
9435939	9437380	It had a lot of USB ports.
9437420	9443946	I know just for the pictures of it, it's got a buttload of... Well, it's also got a bunch of weird things to it.
9444627	9449892	For one, it's got two HDTV outsides, so you can actually have two HDTV setups.
9450492	9454536	One for the actual gameplay and one for almost like a dual screen.
9454596	9455517	Like a DS, basically.
9455537	9457619	Like a DS, yeah.
9457879	9458560	It's going to have...
9460413	9462394	I saw three Ethernet ports on there.
9462434	9467297	Now, I don't know what the hell that's about either, but it's just a lot of weird stuff on there.
9467417	9470379	And I'm actually pulling up the picture right now for my reference.
9471740	9474142	But I remember also...
9475143	9475483	I don't know.
9475583	9476985	It just looked interesting.
9477185	9481288	I know that it's going to be Wi-Fi as well, but I don't see why you need so many damn USB ports.
9481568	9484410	But then again, I don't know why you need so many damn USB ports on a computer.
9484430	9489594	Now, it's going to be that we do know that every next-gen system is going to be wireless and their controllers and stuff.
9489614	9494078	So I kind of assume that the USB ports are for four for controllers and two for...
9494822	9496924	and whatever USB stuff you want to put in.
9497865	9500247	Here's a good shot of the back here right now.
9500327	9511636	And I see, I count them, three Ethernet ports, two USB ports, the AV out, which is like your standard AV out, the digital audio out, the two HDTV outs.
9512097	9513098	That's only on the back.
9513758	9517081	Then you've got, and I honestly don't know why there's three Ethernet ports.
9517101	9518162	That makes no sense to me.
9518242	9518362	But
9519412	9528103	Whatever, and then as far as front ports go, I remember there's at least a couple USB ports that are underneath this little cover thing on the front.
9530046	9531507	I'm trying to see if I can get a picture here.
9532088	9535693	Anyways, yeah, so there's a ton of stuff on there.
9535913	9538256	I don't know why, but I'm sure they've got a reason for it.
9538336	9542757	I think, okay, you have to remember with the next gen systems too, what everybody is doing, not just Microsoft.
9542777	9544517	Microsoft's kind of been saying they're going to do this.
9544877	9548618	They're going to expand and not just be about gaming, right?
9548658	9552739	Microsoft wants to be an entertainment center where you can download music and do things like that.
9552779	9559740	So I think you're going to see this on a lot of the next gen systems that there's more things to plug in there for your media setup at home than just your controllers.
9560041	9561821	And I think that's kind of what this is all about on PS3.
9562819	9568181	Yeah, and then I saw, you know, and then I read they're going to replace memory cards with memory stick duos.
9569602	9571363	I don't think they would do that.
9571403	9572924	Probably USB drives of anything.
9573684	9574024	Who knows?
9574064	9574384	We'll see.
9576125	9578686	All right, Siggy, we're going to let you go so we can just get to some other stuff on the show.
9579346	9579527	Yeah.
9579667	9580587	But have a good one, buddy, okay?
9581127	9581387	All right.
9581668	9581868	Later.
9581968	9582188	Later.
9582988	9585069	I do know what some of those USB ports are going to be used for.
9585789	9586890	Interfacing with your PSP.
9588305	9590887	Well, that and wireless is going to be poor, too.
9591127	9591867	You can bet on that.
9592047	9593608	Guys, imagine the member of the Pocket Station.
9593788	9597470	Yep, I met most of you that don't remember that, but that's what they're going to do.
9597490	9597790	We'll see.
9598482	9603184	All right, what we're going to do now is we're actually not tonight going to have a cage match.
9603204	9604525	We actually kind of ran out of time.
9604765	9609267	And also, even though DarkSakura was able to send me her file, we're just running out of time.
9609307	9610167	We don't have time to do it.
9610207	9612749	We figured you guys would want to know the E3 coverage more than that.
9613129	9616250	So we'll table the cage match to next week.
9617031	9620812	But we can't possibly get through a show without doing some FUs of the week.
9621753	9625054	So let's get into the FUs of the week if we can here.
9627941	9634343	Loki, I did get some from Jamie, so I'll go ahead and start off with hers, FUs of the Week here.
9634423	9635863	So here we go.
9636603	9640024	If you guys want to send in your FUs of the Week, send a private message to Sky in the chat room.
9640404	9646086	And after the FUs of the Week, we'll go back to the Skype line and do some Ask Orange Lounge, actually, as well.
9646546	9648927	So here we go, the FUs of the Week.
9649047	9651147	Why is it, Loki, that we do the FUs every single week?
9651408	9652748	Because we have to.
9658775	9659216	All right.
9660877	9670126	DarkSakura would like to say an F you to Drama and Sunburns and the Fast Pass being turned off for Roger Rabbit.
9672168	9672549	All right.
9673009	9674911	Loki, your F yous of the week.
9676176	9685501	My first F you goes to Audioslave for having this giant concert in the middle of Hollywood and Highland, and that really sucked.
9687382	9699328	And also, fuck you to E3, or mainly just the convention hall, for stopping accepting credit cards after a certain time.
9699947	9725318	and it's like during the middle of lunch rush, they're just like, yeah, we just don't want to do credit cards, we're going to do cash only, of course you don't realize that until after you've gotten your food, so you're fucked if you don't have cash, luckily I, you know, had cash, so that was no problem, and basically also fuck you the Motel 6 for their crappy beds, because they're just uncomfortable as hell, and yeah, that's
9726142	9734147	Fuck you to Rockstar for not actually showing any of their games and wasting a big space in E3.
9734908	9740011	And also to Nintendo for not having a revolution there because I wanted to see that.
9741712	9742032	That's it.
9743613	9743933	My turn.
9749000	9762251	F you to that bitch at Konami's booth, not working there, somebody who was an observer, that said I tried to dig my nails into her over a t-shirt, and she whined and complained like a little baby and got her boyfriend mad at me.
9762692	9766635	I was so stunned that somebody would be so trite that I didn't even know what to say back.
9767015	9770138	But if I could say anything back, I would say something along these lines.
9771419	9775062	Your girlfriend is lying to you about me digging my nails into her.
9775122	9775963	She is making it up.
9776641	9781043	She's probably lying to you about being monogamous with you as well.
9782444	9784705	So screw you, lady and stupid boyfriend.
9784745	9786026	How dare you call me an asshole.
9786767	9788508	I wish my posse was there to beat you up.
9790929	9797272	Also, I'd like to give an F you to $8 hamburgers at E3 that aren't even that good.
9797793	9803776	And having to wait in line for 45 minutes, I'm not even kidding, 45 minutes to get a freaking hamburger is horrible.
9806010	9811072	So an F you to the fact that the next two days I had to eat lunch at 10.30 if I wanted to avoid lines.
9811293	9811733	Horrible.
9812373	9816215	And even then we had to wait like, what, 15 minutes for a pizza that one day because I kept dropping them?
9816576	9824280	Yeah, the second day we got pizza, dumb bitch there didn't even understand how to cook pizza, which was quite funny because I loved just watching it.
9824710	9846718	Like, pulled over as they, like, hit the end and started backing up into the oven But I got my pizza, and thank you to the stupid Mexican bitch Um, she, um, gave me sort of food poisoning, so I had bad gas all day long Thank you, thank you, thank you But the pizza's still good, even though it's doughy Alright, let's go on to the chatroom FUs, shall we?

9854526	9856988	MPQ says, F you to my wireless mouse.

9864052	9866074	Also an F you to Shaza Ambamani style.
9866094	9866954	You're being a retard.

9878562	9880504	Next F you comes from Ron Chan.

9927305	9929026	Thank God we're not in that time zone.
9929426	9932328	Crouton6 says, F you to Loki for hating in the groove.
9933669	9935491	Yeah, well, fuck in the groove for sucking.
9937092	9942175	DarkKnight says, F you to early morning meetings at work and poor road trip planning.
9942516	9945958	Having to schedule some time off for a racing event that was actually moved to next weekend.
9946358	9948980	And having to work Saturday, missing the cookout of cookouts.
9949060	9950261	Damn you to hell, Job.
9952918	9956500	Raichan says, F you to cheap power supplies that die on Friday the 13th.
9956560	9957561	Ooh, that's a sign.
9958522	9959882	Yeah, the power supplies suck.
9960603	9961083	I guess so.
9961183	9961824	Alright, that's it.
9961844	9962844	That's all the F yous we got.
9962964	9964445	So, there you have it.
9964665	9965226	Oh, one more.
9965486	9966787	One late one that just came in.
9967347	9968068	LemonLineJump.

9970969	9972190	I ruined my own Monday.
9973491	9974452	How do you ruin your own Monday?
9977093	9977434	Alright.
9979135	9979235	Um...
9981573	9988875	I guess what we're going to do is do a quick break, then we'll come back and do some Ask Orange Lounge, because I'm sure you guys have some questions after E3.
9990536	9996758	And to make Loki very happy with me, I think what we'll actually do in this break is play some music from In The Groove.
9998479	9999439	Whatever, I don't care.
10000279	10004421	So we'll be back after this quick break, just a couple songs here, and then we're going to do some Ask Orange Lounge.
10004441	10008162	So send your questions over to Sky in the chat room, and we'll be back after this.
10014834	10017817	Come play with me Come play with me Come play with me
10061367	10062547	Free like a bird in the sky
10098834	10099694	Play with me!
10099714	10100795	Come play with me!
10100815	10101595	Come play with me!
10135545	10136206	Thank you.
10260934	10264135	After this song, we'll be having a Let Them Move marathon.
10264356	10266517	No!
10266697	10267357	Just kidding.
10267777	10268818	Orange Lounge Radio.
10268898	10270518	Crap-free Bavani Radio.
10271919	10277161	Hello, we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio Live, wrapping things up here with a little bit of Ask Orange Lounge.
10277221	10284164	In that break, you heard some in-the-groove music, Nina with Fly With Me, and Mind Reflection with Remember December.
10284184	10285285	What was that last one?
10285905	10287426	That's a fan favorite, believe it or not.
10287566	10289707	I do not care for that song at all, but the fan's
10290143	10291124	Ask me to play it, so I do.
10291925	10292485	So there you have it.
10293206	10294487	I do like the Fly With Me song, though.
10294507	10295107	I do like that one.
10295207	10296829	I just don't like Remember December, personally.
10299351	10305716	Let's get into Ask Orange Lounge, where you guys, the listeners, get to control the show by sending us questions, and we answer them.
10305796	10306757	It's just that simple.
10307017	10309099	It's really an easy concept, honestly.
10315704	10316925	Let's Ask Orange Lounge.
10317498	10318599	some stupid question.
10319119	10322401	What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?
10322901	10329724	I hope they have some questions to ask us about E3 and not so much random stuff this week because that gets annoying.
10331305	10333586	I like how you add the extra syllable in orange.
10335167	10343171	Orange Orange Look, that's the best thing I gotta do by improvising here.
10344594	10347837	Hey, at least you had better grammar than that one distribution company.
10349198	10355644	Crouton6 wants to know, is there any known way to hook up my $400 2DX arcade-style controller to a freaking PS3?
10357525	10368015	If PS3 is backwards compatible, which I believe they have said it will be, PS2 and PS1 backwards compatible, you can bet that there will be some type of converter that will turn one of the USB ports into a regular controller port.
10368155	10368595	Guaranteed.
10368615	10369376	There's got to be something.
10369596	10371478	I mean, otherwise you can't be backwards compatible, so...
10371926	10377171	Well, yes, you can, because you can still play the old games with the DualShock sort of controllers.
10377571	10379413	But here's the thing, though, what you can do.
10379593	10388782	I know they have this, too, as some sort of Wi-Fi thing you plug into your normal controllers, and it's just like, you know, basically... There'll be a way.
10390663	10391184	I'm sure.
10391204	10391884	There'll be a way.
10391924	10392725	There's got to be something.
10393746	10396529	That's why you need to save your old PS2 and don't sell it.
10397963	10402385	Illusion wants to know, were we supposed to set our watches an hour forward daylight savings time?
10402725	10405366	About three weeks ago that happened, didn't it?
10405946	10406766	I believe so.
10407627	10408907	Spring forward, fall back, right?
10408947	10410008	Yeah, we did that a while ago.
10410028	10410808	What the hell, dude?
10411288	10413989	Alright, he says, I wasn't here for the first hour or two hours.
10414069	10415230	I don't know, I'm lost in time.
10415270	10416230	I really don't know when I came in.
10416590	10418811	Anyway, can you guys give me a quick summary on what happened?
10420819	10424481	Okay, for those of you who joined late, we talked about E3 and what we did.
10424961	10430724	Well, actually, no, we can't tell you, but what you can do is you can check into the reruns that we play on DDR Freak Radio.
10430744	10431405	There you go.
10431465	10431925	Friday.
10432005	10432425	There you go.
10432445	10433146	There you go.
10433546	10434427	Nice plug there.
10434467	10437028	You can listen to the Rewind on DDR Freak Radio Friday nights.
10438358	10441260	Just to sum up, we talked Beatmania USA and the DDRs.
10441540	10443701	We played a song that's going to be in DDR Extreme 2.
10443741	10446082	And we gave away a million dollars and you didn't win.
10447302	10450123	And we played the bootleg copy of the new MIDI head mix from Ultramix 3.
10450824	10453084	And what was that song from Extreme 2?
10453204	10454625	Plovotlian Dance and Chorus?
10454805	10456166	I'm not even going to try to pronounce it.
10456226	10456826	We played it.
10458709	10464493	Dark Knight says, Sky, was the G4 bit with you guys for G4TV.com show or another show?
10464974	10470178	Where you're going to see it, from what I understand, if they even use it, which I don't know, it's G4TV.com, the show.
10471162	10500582	and it's like when they're coming back from commercial they'll probably show the booth and we're clapping and I'm wearing a bright ass green shirt and a t-shirt so you can't miss me and then Loki's standing right next to me and I don't remember what you were wearing that day I don't remember either and Mikotov was standing with us as well so you can see him too I don't remember no I think the last day of war it was like a just a normal shirt but yeah I had a bag an Xbox 360 bag I think I had one too
10501660	10502361	Um, let's see.
10503401	10505623	MPQ, should I bother going to Episode 3?
10506103	10507404	Do you think it's worth the trouble?
10508184	10509225	I haven't seen Episode 3.
10509345	10510886	I'm not, like, huge on Star Wars.
10511306	10515248	I will see the movie, but I'm going to wait until the frenzy dies down.
10515348	10518050	Yes, it's worth the trouble, from what I hear.
10519030	10520631	It's what the fans have been looking for.
10521592	10528796	I mean, and also, in other news, War of the Worlds is supposed to be what people were expecting for Independence Day and Signs.
10529346	10531567	In other words, it's not going to disappoint you.
10532768	10533828	New trailer online, by the way.
10534489	10534989	Oh, really?
10535669	10536390	It looks spiffy.
10536510	10537370	We'll have to look into that.
10538151	10539472	All right, let's see.
10539972	10547736	VidPower, on a scale of 1 Sucktastic to 10 Fantastic, rate your overall E3 experience.
10550438	10551198	I give mine a 7.
10554420	10555981	Honestly, I give mine about a 6.
10557233	10557433	Ranchan
10586428	10591332	RonChan says, OK Sky, please explain the ferret because I'm lost.
10591372	10597337	The ferret is basically these little toys that we bought a long time ago.
10598117	10601500	One of them was given to me as a Christmas present years ago.
10602781	10604742	We've been doing Orange Lounge Radio for like three years.
10605263	10605483	Stop it.
10607805	10609406	One of those was given to me like three years ago.
10609526	10614110	And Jamie found it one show, like it was sitting on my dresser or something, and she started playing with it.
10614130	10616272	And she was giggling and thought it was the cutest thing ever.
10616752	10619914	And she hasn't stopped since.
10619954	10621175	That was like two years ago.
10621195	10624738	And then one day, just to be funny, I bought about six of them.
10625299	10625719	Oh, I hate you.
10625739	10628801	And I repaired them because they had dead batteries.
10628841	10630983	So I had to cut them open and repair them.
10631063	10633265	And then one of them got stuck on the Katamari.
10633845	10634586	Where did you find...
10636339	10637700	Those people want to buy them.
10638060	10639201	You're not going to find them anywhere.
10639221	10641983	They're called Scoozies is what they're called.
10642143	10648266	It's like S-C-U-Z-Z or I-E or Z-I-E.
10648366	10649747	You can find them on eBay.
10649807	10650808	They're kind of expensive.
10651608	10653109	But those are where I found them.
10653169	10654810	I found them at Discount Toy Store.
10654830	10658472	It's basically the discount outlet store for KB.
10659013	10660634	And I bought what was left.
10660714	10662175	And there was hardly anything left.
10662235	10662895	And they were dead.
10663724	10665105	I like Dark Knight's summary there.
10665165	10667307	She uses the ferret to annoy Skye to death.
10667467	10668047	Yep, you got it.
10668507	10669908	Yep, you can find them on eBay.
10670829	10673591	Okay, Ron Chan also wants to know, Loki, your favorite Nintendo character?
10674351	10675772	My favorite Nintendo character?
10675792	10680135	Um... I don't know.
10683237	10684338	We'll just say Zelda.
10684578	10685038	Or Link.
10685359	10686379	Link's kind of cool.
10686960	10688961	I don't have a really favorite Nintendo character.
10688981	10692964	Unless you want to include... What's his name from...
10693894	10696656	Was it Super Joe from Bionic Commando?
10696676	10698078	Because technically he was on Nintendo.
10698338	10702321	My favorite would be, without a doubt, the Eggplant Wizard, but not from the cartoon.
10702761	10703942	Not the cartoon Eggplant Wizard.
10703962	10704943	That guy was disgusting.
10705323	10709967	The Eggplant Wizard, as portrayed in the original 8-bit Icarus, was awesome.
10711128	10713570	If not the Eggplant Wizard, and that's why they need to make a new Kid Icarus.
10714531	10715772	Please, please, Nintendo.
10715812	10717113	Pretty, pretty please with sugar on top.
10717253	10717614	I don't care.
10717694	10718354	Put it on the DS.
10718394	10718714	I don't care.
10718755	10719375	Just make me a new one.
10720636	10722357	King Hippo, a close second.
10724983	10727685	KingHippo was a badass.
10728986	10731228	Doobs is asking, what happened with Kingdom Hearts 2?
10731688	10732769	I think it's too late for a question.
10732809	10733709	No, you're not too late for a question.
10734230	10737572	But I did talk about Kingdom Hearts 2 with a previous caller, so I hope you were listening.
10739153	10744757	Again, Kingdom Hearts 2, it's like Kingdom Hearts 1, but with a better camera and Aurons in it, which is very cool.
10744777	10746659	And it looks like the graphics are upgraded, too.
10746779	10748460	And overdrive mode, or drive mode.
10749000	10751402	It's really amazing, actually, what they've done with that engine, like,
10751854	10754896	and thousands of characters on the screen at one time.
10755396	10756096	It's pretty nice.
10757277	10758638	So yeah, pretty awesome game.
10758678	10759718	Definitely get it when it comes out.
10761379	10761680	Alright.
10763961	10764421	And that's it.
10764481	10768824	That's all the questions we got tonight for Ask Orange Lounge.
10768884	10769424	I guess that's it.
10770104	10772165	Oh, Dubz is confessing he wasn't there.
10772225	10772766	He was gone.
10773126	10774447	Oh, that was the best part too.
10774627	10775547	You just reminded me.
10776148	10778469	Remember when they were having all the technical issues with...
10780675	10786940	with more friends and the one guitarist from the Black Banjos on the guitar.
10787180	10787741	That was awesome.
10787761	10789082	That was pretty awesome.
10790805	10791305	Thank you for watching!
10811591	10812752	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10832305	10833845	of the animations you see in the video.
10833865	10835786	Which I will be using for my own reference.
10835846	10836526	Here's the thing.
10836946	10839867	They are in Photoshop format, super high quality.
10839907	10847408	If you want to build a website, get your hands one way or another on a Konami press kit because they've got these great Beatmania concepts.
10847648	10851609	Just the industrial things, the spinning things you see, all that stuff.
10851629	10853269	You know what would also be awesome to do with that?
10853669	10856550	To make your own Beatmania skin for Stepmania.
10858303	10859123	I'm not doing it.
10859684	10860704	I ain't putting that effort in.
10860844	10867826	So that's why you see it in there, because they didn't realize that those were not game screenshots, but it's just concept art.
10868946	10874028	If you want to make a Beatmania-themed webpage, seriously, that's exactly what it's for.
10874468	10875428	At least my impression.
10875488	10876269	So that's kind of cool.
10876429	10880270	You know, I'm really sad that none of the trailer video is on there.
10880711	10882152	Jam with the Band for the Nintendo DS
10906348	10907490	I didn't see it anywhere.
10908211	10908411	Nope.
10908771	10909272	I didn't see it.
10910453	10911234	I didn't see it either.
10911335	10912256	I guess I didn't show it.
10912736	10915400	Unless I somehow completely missed it, which is possible.
10915480	10917523	We did play a music game on Gizmondo.
10918063	10919906	Yeah, what was that Gizmondo music game you played real quick?
10919926	10920366	I don't remember.
10920667	10921548	It was some guitar game.
10921949	10922529	It was kind of weird.
10922569	10923771	It was like a guitar game.
10924509	10931659	Sort of like, I don't even know how to compare it, but it's very, it's like a rhythm music game with action game mixed in it.
10931899	10932420	It's kind of weird.
10932460	10934102	DarkSakura actually played it a little more.
10934162	10935564	Maybe she can fill you in on it next week.
10935604	10936184	Don't forget to ask.
10936585	10937766	Last, last one real quick.
10937847	10941191	Doobs wants to know, if you didn't talk about this already, what happened with the Katamari?
10941770	10942151	We don't know.
10942191	10943372	We imagine they rolled it out the door.
10943472	10945794	It's probably sitting in Namco's big office somewhere.
10946094	10946955	They probably think it's funny.
10947235	10948196	But our media sampler's on it.
10948216	10950938	Our media sampler's on there, and then a few inches away, the ferret.
10951058	10952440	Yeah, so, kind of funny.
10954361	10956303	Which will have pictures of that online soon, hopefully.
10956383	10956984	It'll be interesting.
10957244	10958925	I'd be curious to know what they are going to do with that.
10958945	10962088	Oh, I did check out my camera and the pictures that it took, and they all suck.
10964250	10967653	So, not much in pretty much everything that we have.
10968055	10972982	That I took a picture of, we have a better copy in the press kit.
10973643	10976688	Jamie said something that she took something like 600 pictures.
10976788	10977869	It's insane.
10977909	10979311	I took like 70 or 80 at most.
10979332	10980153	She took like 600.
10983157	10983898	I took 117, I deleted most of them.
11007618	11009700	The only thing I know how to say is, what are you doing this weekend?
11009720	11011481	And I'm sure that's useful in some sense, but... All right.
11034153	11034553	That's it.
11034593	11035754	We've got to wrap up the show, you guys.
11036414	11038656	Some folks in the chat room are asking about the sex game.
11038676	11039956	They want to hear your story with the sex game.
11039976	11042918	I'm going to have to tell you guys to go to the podcast because it's all in the podcast.
11043639	11045060	Thursday and Friday's edition.
11045660	11050423	Their website, unfortunately, does not have anything about the game or at least it's all in Korean and I couldn't figure it out.
11052825	11056227	I will purchase the game because I actually told Nellie about it and she wanted to play it.
11057088	11059069	Even after I told her about the peripherals.
11059429	11059749	I don't know.
11059769	11060870	That's going to be interesting.
11062458	11064819	All right, we are out of here, you guys.
11065239	11066119	Final thought, Loki.
11068000	11069100	I drank too much water.
11070341	11078384	And my final thought is I'm hungry, and I feel like one of those McDonald's fruit and walnut salads for some weird-ass reason.
11079064	11080385	Ice cream would be really good, too, though.
11080805	11081945	I got to eat yogurt.
11082185	11084226	I got this thing of yogurt, and it's getting old.
11084793	11086114	Final word of the show.
11087014	11087714	Good night, everybody.
11087814	11090915	Have a good one, and we'll see you next week with more Orange Lounge.
11090935	11091836	DarkSakura will be back.
11091876	11093476	We hope to have guests in the studio as well.
11093836	11096377	Don't forget to check out our podcast and other live shows.
11096897	11099158	There will be a surprise live show this week as well.
11099458	11100419	That's all I'm going to say.
11101499	11101879	Tune in.
11101939	11104220	Maybe our live general community will have more information on that.
11104260	11104660	We'll see.
11105020	11111683	And tonight's fortune cookie, DarkSakura didn't send me a new one just yet, so you get a classic fortune cookie from our archives that I love.
11111983	11113263	Final word of the show, Loki.
11113704	11114624	One word that sums it all up.
11115267	11115847	Beatmania
11142782	11148023	Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sensimia Street?
11148423	11151504	How to get to Sensimia Street?
11151744	11155885	How to get to Sensimia Street?
11155985	11161286	Hello, Kermit the Frog here, and welcome to Sensimia Street.
11162427	11168128	I'd like to tell you what today's letter is, but I am really f***ed up.
11169741	11172302	Hey, Big Bird, do you know what today's letter is?
11172743	11174143	Sure, Kermit.
11174563	11179125	Today's letter is... Joint.
11180706	11184388	Uh, Big Bird, joint is not a letter.
11186668	11187409	It is a word.
11188249	11189230	Sorry, kids.
11189850	11192871	Today's letter is three.
11193071	11194532	Hmm, Big Bird, uh...
11196095	11197436	Three is a number.
11198437	11199378	Exactly.
11199958	11204482	The number three, which is how many joints I've smoked today.
11206964	11209506	Kermit, are you with me?
11211768	11212849	Thank God I'm stoned.
11213903	11215164	Me too.
11216364	11220586	Guys, guys, show go on.
11220746	11222066	Come on.
11222347	11223967	Thank you, Elmo.
11224768	11227649	How about we say our ABCs, Big Bird?
11228589	11229730	Okay.
11230990	11236792	A, B, C, D, E, F, R, G, Q, K, C, R, S, F,
11244881	11247463	I forgot what we were doing, Kramit.
11248844	11250766	Did you just call me Kramit?
11251246	11252367	Yes, I did.
11253428	11254749	Kramity Frog here.
11255610	11259633	Okay, okay.
11260454	11262515	That's all the time we have for today.
11263376	11264097	Goodbye, kids.
11264357	11268780	Today's show was brought to you by the letter... Bong.
11269000	11270342	And the number...
11274321	11278942	Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.
11332796	11352128	Okay kids, that's it, we're off to tape our podcast, so those of you guys that are already subscribed to the podcast, if you haven't already, we did like three episodes from LA, so freaking get on your iPod or Doppler or whatever and catch up on the stream, and then we're going to tape a new one tonight as well, so you get lots of podcasts this month, you lucky bastards!
11353729	11358632	And right now though, our live stream, you're going to get dumped from the live stream, but don't be too
