Hi!

00:59.640 --> 01:00.640
Hello, how are you?

01:00.640 --> 01:01.640
Creaky.

01:01.640 --> 01:02.640
Creaky?

01:02.640 --> 01:03.640
What's wrong?

01:03.640 --> 01:06.480
It was just my throat's going.

01:06.480 --> 01:08.680
Yeah, you had to talk a lot more tonight, huh?

01:08.680 --> 01:09.680
Yeah.

01:09.680 --> 01:10.680
During the three hour program.

01:10.680 --> 01:12.240
I had to fill up for Loki's loud butt.

01:12.240 --> 01:17.280
Yeah, Loki is not here taping the podcast with us right now because he actually, this

01:17.280 --> 01:21.080
is interesting, in order for him to be freed up for the week so he can go to E3, he has

01:21.080 --> 01:22.360
to spend time with a woman.

01:22.360 --> 01:28.000
so that's cute though so sweet yeah so hopefully he's having fun he'll be back

01:28.000 --> 01:30.700
of course for the shows live for me three wednesday thursday friday which

01:30.700 --> 01:35.160
he's very excited about as well before we get into tonight's news i want to

01:35.160 --> 01:40.200
state that we're going to be fielding questions for the and I want to give you

01:40.200 --> 01:42.960
the guys the email address you can start sending your questions now because we'll

01:42.960 --> 01:48.880
be fielding questions for our show it's the email address is e3 at orange lounge

01:48.880 --> 01:54.880
radio dot com e3 at orange lounge radio dot com and if you send us emails to

01:54.880 --> 01:58.720
that address you maybe want to know about a certain game that we don't talk

01:58.720 --> 02:02.720
about on Wednesday's podcast send us an email there and we'll go check it out

02:02.720 --> 02:06.240
now we won't be able to do every email but we'll try to get as many as we can

02:06.240 --> 02:09.280
we'll go check it out and give you the answers Thursday or Friday's podcast so

02:09.280 --> 02:12.160
it'd be a great way for those of you guys that unfortunately can't be there

02:12.160 --> 02:17.580
in person to kind of live vicariously through us so before we get into the big

02:17.580 --> 02:23.420
E3 news dark sacro, how was your gaming week? What kind of games? Did you play PSO blue burst?

02:23.420 --> 02:28.740
Just a couple of nights this week me too. Honestly, I can just state my gaming week right here

02:28.740 --> 02:32.740
I've been all about this PSO blue burst beta. It's exciting, isn't it?

02:35.020 --> 02:41.740
You know like that you can resize the window it's all pretty cool I've been really enjoying and it runs so beautifully. Oh, yeah

02:41.740 --> 02:47.540
Oh my gosh, what do you think of PSO blue burst as compared to PSO on the Xbox GameCube, etc?

02:47.540 --> 02:51.140
what are there any other platforms you've played it on I miss the the chat

02:51.140 --> 02:57.020
honestly and yes there just is something about playing PSO with a controller in

02:57.020 --> 03:02.220
front of your big TV with the Xbox and everything a bit overall is not too bad

03:02.220 --> 03:06.560
I do miss you know you don't have on the beta right now we don't have that

03:06.560 --> 03:14.140
access to episode 2 we don't have access to I think it's V harden up but it's

03:14.140 --> 03:18.160
It's kind of hard to bitch too much because it's free right now.

03:18.160 --> 03:24.520
You can play this game absolutely free www.psobb.com and you can sign up for an account and play

03:24.520 --> 03:28.360
and it's free right now through June 10th and of course it'll be one of those things

03:28.360 --> 03:31.980
where if you want to continue you'll have to buy the legit game but from what I'm seeing

03:31.980 --> 03:37.120
so far I'm almost ready to quit other MMOs I'm on to play this more.

03:37.120 --> 03:38.120
This and other MMOs.

03:38.120 --> 03:40.640
I'm about to axe Final Fantasy XI.

03:40.640 --> 03:43.560
I've heard so many good things about Guild Wars 2 I want to get in on that.

03:43.560 --> 03:46.200
I kind of want to try that too.

03:46.200 --> 03:48.000
I think the MMOs are shifting.

03:48.000 --> 03:51.960
Unless some Final Fantasy XI news comes out at E3 that just knocks my socks off, and I

03:51.960 --> 03:55.160
still can't get World of Warcraft to even install on my computer, so I can't even check

03:55.160 --> 03:56.160
that one out still.

03:56.160 --> 03:59.840
I've only been able to watch other people play.

03:59.840 --> 04:03.240
Those games are going to get pushed aside for these new ones if nothing changes soon.

04:03.240 --> 04:04.240
So we'll see.

04:04.240 --> 04:05.240
We'll see.

04:05.240 --> 04:06.240
Seriously.

04:06.240 --> 04:07.240
So that was pretty much your gaming week, huh?

04:07.240 --> 04:08.240
Yeah, pretty much.

04:08.240 --> 04:09.240
Pretty much mine too.

04:09.240 --> 04:10.940
That about sums it up.

04:10.940 --> 04:12.360
Let's get into some gaming news this week.

04:12.360 --> 04:16.240
Usually this is kind of a dead week because it's kind of the calm before the storm, and

04:16.240 --> 04:18.480
there's a lot of big secrets still to Comedy 3.

04:18.480 --> 04:21.880
For instance, what is Nintendo going to say about the revolution?

04:21.880 --> 04:24.280
What will we find out about PlayStation 3?

04:24.280 --> 04:28.720
And rumors are that ads are already showing up over LA, cryptic ads about the PlayStation

04:28.720 --> 04:29.720
3.

04:29.720 --> 04:31.540
We'll see next week's show for sure.

04:31.540 --> 04:36.680
But of course, Xbox kind of decided to get the jumpstart by having their MTV special

04:36.680 --> 04:37.680
earlier this week.

04:37.680 --> 04:39.100
Did you watch the special by chance?

04:39.100 --> 04:40.100
I don't have MTV.

04:40.100 --> 04:41.840
Oh yeah, you don't have cable.

04:41.840 --> 04:46.900
I don't watch MTV either, so I'm kind of at the school of thought where I'm just going

04:46.900 --> 04:52.580
to check it out because I'm lucky and blessed where I get to go to E3 next week so I can

04:52.580 --> 04:54.060
just wait.

04:54.060 --> 04:58.100
However, from what I've read on the internet, because lots of sites have been covering this,

04:58.100 --> 05:02.900
you know, 1UP.com, GameSpot.com, all those sites, pretty much no surprises.

05:02.900 --> 05:06.740
A lot of stuff that the speculation, it is the white system, it's thinner.

05:06.740 --> 05:10.300
I was surprised though because the screenshots I've seen, and a lot of people have been echoing

05:10.300 --> 05:15.900
The screenshots that have been released, not that much more impressive than Xbox One.

05:15.900 --> 05:19.420
But I think we have to remember we're still looking at prototypes, and, you know, these

05:19.420 --> 05:23.260
are the launch games, too, so the system can only get better from here, so I am excited

05:23.260 --> 05:24.900
to see what the future brings.

05:24.900 --> 05:28.900
I think all the next-gen systems are going to look damn good, though, so they're all

05:28.900 --> 05:30.900
going to look near video quality.

05:30.900 --> 05:35.780
So I don't think it's going to be a graphical contest so much as it's going to be a quality

05:35.780 --> 05:38.500
of game contest, and...

05:38.500 --> 05:44.500
You know, I was looking at the new releases for the Xbox 360, now that looked hot.

05:44.500 --> 05:46.500
They had screen captures.

05:46.500 --> 05:48.500
What kind of stuff?

05:48.500 --> 05:51.500
You know what? Give me a second.

05:51.500 --> 05:53.500
There was...

05:55.500 --> 05:57.500
You have to ask me where my brains are working.

05:57.500 --> 06:00.500
Are there particular games that you saw on a list that were coming out soon?

06:00.500 --> 06:02.500
That's what I'm trying to remember.

06:02.500 --> 06:05.500
Oh, like Ghost Recon 2, I think?

06:05.500 --> 06:07.500
I didn't care about Ghost Recon.

06:07.500 --> 06:14.500
I'll let you think about it for a minute, but a lot of the stuff that we found out about

06:14.500 --> 06:17.460
Xbox 360 was stuff we kind of already had speculated about.

06:17.460 --> 06:19.900
The power button scan is changeable.

06:19.900 --> 06:24.400
Xbox Live is going to have a gold and a silver platform, so that's good that Xbox Live will

06:24.400 --> 06:25.880
be free for some people.

06:25.880 --> 06:28.960
One thing we're still not sure on though is backwards compatibility.

06:28.960 --> 06:30.420
Nobody's really said one way or the other.

06:30.420 --> 06:34.820
Now there's rumors and there's screen caps out there that are supposed to prove rumors

06:34.820 --> 06:39.880
and everything, but we don't know anything concrete for sure absolutely just yet on that

06:39.880 --> 06:43.460
and that's one thing I'm definitely looking forward to hearing about.

06:43.460 --> 06:49.340
But Xbox 360 looks exciting, I gotta admit, as exciting as Xbox 360 looks, I'm excited

06:49.340 --> 06:52.500
about the competition as well, I wanna see what Playstation and Nintendo have to come

06:52.500 --> 06:54.300
up with as well, it's gonna be an exciting show.

06:54.300 --> 06:58.540
Need for Speed was the one I was thinking of, that one actually looks pretty good.

06:58.540 --> 07:00.540
And I'm actually looking forward to seeing Quake 4.

07:00.540 --> 07:02.700
Oh yes, Quake 4, that's a good one.

07:02.700 --> 07:05.580
Perfect Dark Zero. That was the one.

07:05.580 --> 07:08.580
Oh, those are all very sexy games, so it is going to have a very nice lineup.

07:08.580 --> 07:10.860
Perfect Dark was a Nintendo franchise, though, wasn't it?

07:10.860 --> 07:12.060
Yeah, very strange, huh?

07:12.060 --> 07:13.220
It was on the 64.

07:13.220 --> 07:15.660
But it was a rare game, and I think they parted ways with it.

07:15.660 --> 07:19.140
Yeah, rare is, though, working with...

07:19.140 --> 07:23.100
Yeah, I remember that story a long time ago, so very interesting there.

07:23.100 --> 07:26.700
One other interesting thing, I think, about the Xbox 360 that we heard this week

07:26.700 --> 07:30.020
from Bill Gates himself in Time magazine.

07:30.020 --> 07:34.860
He says, the next version of Halo will not, repeat, not be ready in time for the launch

07:34.860 --> 07:39.720
of Xbox 360, however, it will be a part of the second wave.

07:39.720 --> 07:46.140
The day Sony launches the new PlayStation, they will walk right into Halo 3.

07:46.140 --> 07:49.100
Very interesting counter move.

07:49.100 --> 07:52.820
Because Microsoft wants to get up the jump on next-gen gaming, which some say could hurt

07:52.820 --> 07:56.660
them, this is the interesting twist they'll have, and I think a lot of us have seen this

07:56.660 --> 07:57.860
coming a mile away.

07:57.860 --> 08:02.320
They're going to release Halo 3 probably same week, same day as PlayStation 3 just to punch

08:02.320 --> 08:04.880
them in the stomach basically.

08:04.880 --> 08:06.260
Interesting tactic.

08:06.260 --> 08:10.600
I think for us hardcore gamers that have money to spend, well not that I necessarily have

08:10.600 --> 08:12.620
money to spend, but I'll find money somehow.

08:12.620 --> 08:16.060
I'll probably get all these systems anyway, sad but true.

08:16.060 --> 08:17.620
You know what my house is like.

08:17.620 --> 08:22.340
But let's, the normal person that, you know, can't, you know, college kid that can't afford

08:22.340 --> 08:25.500
necessarily all these systems, it's going to make the decision kind of tough.

08:25.500 --> 08:29.500
I think, I think it'll really depend on Sony's launch titles

08:29.500 --> 08:32.580
and I hope Nintendo's learning their lesson after the DS with launch titles

08:32.580 --> 08:33.340
as well. They need

08:33.340 --> 08:36.340
any stronger launch titles because I was not impressed with DS launch.

08:36.340 --> 08:40.740
Yeah. But hopefully Revolution will have some strong strong launch titles. We'll see.

08:40.740 --> 08:45.460
Very interesting there. Speaking of Nintendo, Revolution is confirmed for

08:45.460 --> 08:48.620
2006, although that may not be the name, it's still the working name.

08:48.620 --> 08:53.780
Revolution is still what we're looking at. 2006, it will play DVDs and they are

08:53.780 --> 08:54.420
saying

08:54.420 --> 08:58.980
backwards compatible they're already saying GameCube games will play good

08:58.980 --> 09:02.260
I think that's a good I think especially with when you think

09:02.260 --> 09:05.900
Zelda is gonna come out now towards the tail end of GameCube's release

09:05.900 --> 09:09.020
Zelda could actually sell revolutions who knows

09:09.020 --> 09:12.140
absolutely and you know the Nintendo way of doing things they'll put something

09:12.140 --> 09:16.100
extra in it if you're on a revolution or something you remember like the

09:16.100 --> 09:20.100
the color Game Boy Zelda's if you play them on an advance you got a special shop

09:20.100 --> 09:23.100
Yeah. All sorts of that kind of stuff.

09:23.100 --> 09:26.600
Um, while we're speaking of E3 and things that we're going to be seeing at E3,

09:26.600 --> 09:29.600
DarkSucker, I'm kind of curious, what things are you looking forward to seeing at E3?

09:29.600 --> 09:31.100
Um...

09:31.100 --> 09:35.100
Uh, the new Katamari Damacy.

09:35.100 --> 09:37.100
Hopefully.

09:37.100 --> 09:39.100
It is, I want to see more on that.

09:39.100 --> 09:41.600
Um...

09:41.600 --> 09:45.100
Really, it's, I'm just going to see what I see as I see it.

09:45.100 --> 09:48.100
I've tried not to read into any of the hype.

09:48.100 --> 09:53.100
I've tried not to look toward anything. I want to go, and I want to be surprised.

09:53.100 --> 09:54.100
Ooh.

09:54.100 --> 09:58.100
And I want the skyline to be back over at the Namco area.

09:58.100 --> 10:01.100
I'm sorry to spoil some things for you on this show, then, but you know I have-

10:01.100 --> 10:06.100
It's fine, I knew it, but I still want to go in and go, oh, you know.

10:06.100 --> 10:08.100
At least you've been staying away from screenshots. That can be a big one.

10:08.100 --> 10:11.100
Except for some of the 360 stuff, because they were hot.

10:11.100 --> 10:14.100
Um, Sega, I know you love Sega.

10:14.100 --> 10:15.100
Sega!

10:15.100 --> 10:20.740
Sega Z3 lineups announced. They'll be showing Phantasy Star Universe, Gunstar Superheroes,

10:20.740 --> 10:23.880
Ooooh, I saw a video of that!

10:23.880 --> 10:28.880
Some titles for the 360, Condemned Criminal Origins and Full Auto. Of course, you can

10:28.880 --> 10:33.520
expect to see a lot of this. Shadow the Hedgehog will probably be the title. They're pushing

10:33.520 --> 10:34.720
more than anything this year.

10:34.720 --> 10:36.600
Yeah, but it's not Sonic.

10:36.600 --> 10:43.600
I know, but that's Sega. Any comments on that? I'm excited about Phantasy Star Universe.

10:43.600 --> 10:51.920
universe I'm all about PSO again now take it um let's see also a story we

10:51.920 --> 10:55.800
were talking about previously you know how Namco likes to license just all this

10:55.800 --> 11:00.080
stuff they license what the peanuts and palm pie all the stuff guess what they

11:00.080 --> 11:06.840
license now curious George although what they've actually licensed here is that

11:06.840 --> 11:10.280
they've licensed based off the new picture that's coming out I didn't even

11:10.280 --> 11:13.580
know this is coming out until I read the story but Universal Pictures is doing an

11:13.580 --> 11:21.940
animated film on Curious George so you'll be seeing something from Namco

11:21.940 --> 11:26.620
in game form a game to coincide with the movies release no doubt that sounds fun

11:26.620 --> 11:30.500
should be interesting yeah should be interesting I don't normally like games

11:30.500 --> 11:35.740
based off of movies although I do wish they make a Kill Bill game but but we'll

11:35.740 --> 11:41.660
see we'll see anyway let's do this orange launch radio we are not just here

11:41.660 --> 11:45.500
to talk about games all the time because if we talked about games all the time we

11:45.500 --> 11:48.700
would have no time to go to Disneyland which by the way we're gonna do this

11:48.700 --> 11:51.620
week that's gonna be we have to take a lot of pictures of Disneyland very excited

11:51.620 --> 11:56.780
about that so to acknowledge that there is more to life than just games Dark

11:56.780 --> 12:01.300
Sakura is here to give you her advice column Dark Sakura what is tonight's

12:01.300 --> 12:06.580
advice column all about today's piece of advice is how to survive if you are

12:06.580 --> 12:11.420
stopped by the police. Wait, how to survive if you're stopped by the police?

12:11.420 --> 12:18.340
Okay. Jackson! Wow, okay. First of all, don't let Sting open his mouth. No! Okay.

12:18.340 --> 12:22.740
Number one, pull over immediately. Put hazard lights on, turn off the radio, and

12:22.740 --> 12:26.660
cut the engine. Roll down the window. Keep hands in plain sight. Make sure your

12:26.660 --> 12:32.260
passenger's hands are also in view. Two, address the officer as officer. Three, tell

12:32.260 --> 12:33.260
Tell the truth.

12:33.260 --> 12:35.900
Do not claim you didn't do it, even if you did.

12:35.900 --> 12:36.900
4.

12:36.900 --> 12:39.140
Don't argue with the officer.

12:39.140 --> 12:42.580
Don't give any reason for the officer to take an interest in your case, which may encourage

12:42.580 --> 12:44.780
the officer to appear in court.

12:44.780 --> 12:48.940
Many defendants succeed in court because the officer is not present.

12:48.940 --> 12:49.940
5.

12:49.940 --> 12:51.540
Choose your test wisely.

12:51.540 --> 12:55.140
If stopped for driving under the influence of alcohol and given the choice of a breath,

12:55.140 --> 12:58.940
blood, or urine test, choose blood only if you're certain you're innocent.

12:58.940 --> 13:03.460
Ensure choose the urine test the least accurate or the breath test do not admit anything

13:03.800 --> 13:08.380
Six contacts a lawyer if you fail any tests in our charge remain silent and call lawyer

13:09.120 --> 13:11.120
What's your final piece of advice?

13:11.540 --> 13:14.120
Is don't freaking go driving a Davis

13:16.100 --> 13:18.620
Nobody outside of NorCal is gonna get that show

13:22.740 --> 13:26.500
Which by the way the police have nothing better to do in that town than pull you over for everything

13:26.500 --> 13:30.100
You know, typically your advice columns are a little out there.

13:30.100 --> 13:32.800
Let's face it, your advice columns are a little out there usually, like you know,

13:32.800 --> 13:37.000
how to avoid the piranhas was one, but this was actually some practical advice.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.100
So, thank you.

13:39.100 --> 13:42.400
You know, piranha advice is practical.

13:42.400 --> 13:44.900
Okay, maybe not for me, but maybe for someone else.

13:44.900 --> 13:48.200
Never know when you're gonna go swimming in a river in Brazil.

13:48.200 --> 13:51.900
All right, well, that was actually some practical advice, especially when you consider that

13:51.900 --> 13:53.600
we're going to be going to LA next week.

13:53.600 --> 13:55.800
Yeah, we'll probably need that.

13:55.800 --> 14:00.480
and the Rodney King thing and all, I mean, who can't we all just get along?

14:00.480 --> 14:04.600
Final Fantasy VII Advent Children has a date.

14:04.600 --> 14:08.700
This is neat. I like this. I like when things come out worldwide at the same

14:08.700 --> 14:09.280
time.

14:09.280 --> 14:15.440
Japan and the US currently being, I think, rumored. I'm not sure if this is

14:15.440 --> 14:16.360
confirmed,

14:16.360 --> 14:20.360
but it does look like we are gonna head towards a near simultaneous release

14:20.360 --> 14:24.860
September 14th in Japan for sure, and I believe they're saying US as well

14:24.860 --> 14:29.860
is gonna hit that day as well. UMD maybe not that same day but shortly thereafter.

14:29.860 --> 14:33.180
So that's exciting. I'm definitely looking forward to Advent Children

14:33.180 --> 14:36.260
and Squeenix's booth at E3 I'm looking forward to as well.

14:36.260 --> 14:39.860
Kingdom Hearts 2 even though I wasn't a fan of the first one necessarily and I

14:39.860 --> 14:41.620
know that sounds... Kingdom Hearts 2 is like

14:41.620 --> 14:44.660
hot. The trailer is... I watched the trailer.

14:44.660 --> 14:47.860
Well actually let me... I like watching

14:47.860 --> 14:50.980
Kingdom Hearts. I like watching people play Kingdom Hearts. I don't like playing

14:50.980 --> 14:53.340
Kingdom Hearts myself because I get frustrated with the camera and stuff.

14:53.340 --> 14:59.260
Supposed to fix the gummy ship. Oh, right made a lot more fun, but it's all about seeing seeing Mickey. Oh

15:00.240 --> 15:04.780
As the king, you know, he's in the trailer and he's in there in the black gear

15:09.020 --> 15:13.260
Also speaking of black Ninja Gaiden black coming out very soon

15:14.060 --> 15:19.940
It's gonna be shown at e3 this week coming out on the Xbox. Of course Ninja Gaiden on the Xbox was

15:19.940 --> 15:25.580
huge it some say it it helped revive the Xbox and kind of bring it up into second

15:25.580 --> 15:30.240
place so very exciting about what is going to be released very soon on Xbox

15:30.240 --> 15:36.720
Ninja Gaiden black so it's gonna have more of like an entry-level difficulty

15:36.720 --> 15:39.960
setting on it a lot of people complain that the first Ninja Gaiden was a little

15:39.960 --> 15:46.880
too hard so that's good a new 50 mission mission mode that should be interesting

15:46.880 --> 15:53.880
and downloadable hurricane packs via Xbox Live. Very interesting, huh?

15:53.880 --> 15:58.880
That's pretty cool. I thought that was pretty fun, too.

15:58.880 --> 16:04.880
Too bad, though, that Kunoichi wasn't as good, or Nightshade, as it was over here.

16:04.880 --> 16:08.880
I'll have to be honest, I didn't play Ninja Gaiden on Xbox. I just heard it was good.

16:08.880 --> 16:13.880
Well, it was pretty good. It was all about dashing back and forth.

16:13.880 --> 16:20.480
Mm-hmm. Xbox Live, you know that they have the arcade thing on Xbox Live where you can

16:20.480 --> 16:23.920
download these games like Bejeweled, Super Collapse...

16:23.920 --> 16:25.080
Pac-Man!

16:25.080 --> 16:28.600
I think, is Pac-Man, Namco Vintage stuff? Yeah, so Pac-Man's in there.

16:28.600 --> 16:29.880
We downloaded Pac-Man once.

16:29.880 --> 16:33.920
Azuma and a lot of those things you'll see on PopCap. It actually, they released their

16:33.920 --> 16:38.440
fifteenth game this week. Crazy, huh? And they're going to be rolling it out into Europe

16:38.440 --> 16:41.800
and Asia. What do you think of the Xbox Live Arcade? For me, it's kind of like...

16:41.800 --> 16:47.000
Pac-Man. Yeah, but isn't Pac-Man old? I mean, don't get me wrong, I have a lot of respect

16:47.000 --> 16:49.820
for Pac-Man, I didn't think it was old. I'm such a retro gamer, it was just cool playing

16:49.820 --> 16:56.580
Pac-Man on the Xbox. If you have any feedback on the Orange Launch Radio 2 Go edition, send

16:56.580 --> 17:02.000
us an email, togo, t-o-g-o at orangelaungeradio.com. Any interesting emails lately you want to

17:02.000 --> 17:05.600
share with us? Give me a second. Well, it's alright, if you don't have any off the top

17:05.600 --> 17:11.760
of your head. Well, no, actually, I haven't really had too much of an opportunity to

17:11.760 --> 17:16.200
to give much attention to it last week because, again, I was getting ready.

17:16.200 --> 17:20.120
I had two weeks' worth of homework to finish in a week.

17:21.400 --> 17:32.680
But it was just, you know, for everybody that we hear from, we have David who goes

17:32.680 --> 17:41.360
by Warrior Bob email on the 10th sent me an email saying that he actually agreed

17:41.360 --> 17:44.360
with my little rant there about how parents should do their job.

17:44.360 --> 17:47.360
Oh yes, your rant last week, I remember that.

17:47.360 --> 17:51.840
I got some feedback on the 1UP.com community too that they were, you know, they liked it

17:51.840 --> 17:52.840
too, so.

17:52.840 --> 17:53.840
Huh.

17:53.840 --> 17:58.960
Well, you know, I know I get vocal, and I know I get really into what I'm saying, and

17:58.960 --> 18:01.440
believe it or not, I'm not like this all the time.

18:01.440 --> 18:08.360
I do get bitchy moments, but I'm not just like, all the damn time, but that is something

18:08.360 --> 18:11.200
I feel very strongly about, you know.

18:11.200 --> 18:19.200
you don't want to piss off Jamie I'm just teasing I cut you but uh but um but

18:19.200 --> 18:22.160
it was cool to get that kind of feedback in here that kind of agreement from

18:22.160 --> 18:27.800
listeners and that gives me a little bit more hope I think that people are

18:27.800 --> 18:32.240
conscious of this now and are trying to encourage other people to start taking

18:32.240 --> 18:35.100
and responsibility for themselves and for their kids.

18:35.100 --> 18:39.800
And also, hates Bi-Rite too.

18:39.800 --> 18:41.280
I hate Bi-Rite.

18:41.280 --> 18:43.620
I told my friend Julie about this,

18:43.620 --> 18:46.920
and we laughed, and we laughed.

18:46.920 --> 18:49.820
So the news last week about Bi-Rite going under,

18:49.820 --> 18:52.300
because Better Business Bureau shut them down.

18:52.300 --> 18:53.140
Interesting.

18:54.640 --> 18:55.480
All right.

18:55.480 --> 18:59.400
This is the audio equivalent of me pointing and laughing.

18:59.400 --> 19:13.720
I think this is actually really exciting news, much more exciting news than people are making

19:13.720 --> 19:14.720
it out to be.

19:14.720 --> 19:20.320
iTunes is now carrying music from Final Fantasy, and when I say iTunes is carrying music from

19:20.320 --> 19:24.360
Final Fantasy, I mean they are carrying like the Japanese import albums.

19:24.360 --> 19:29.480
They're carrying the 220-2002 live concert CD.

19:29.480 --> 19:34.680
They're carrying the original four-disc soundtracks for the later games, Final Fantasy X.

19:34.680 --> 19:37.520
They're carrying the Black Mages album, both of them.

19:37.520 --> 19:41.480
This is stuff you couldn't get in the U.S. before, and now you can buy them on iTunes.

19:41.480 --> 19:45.080
What I think is exciting about this is that this is hopefully going to be a trend, and

19:45.080 --> 19:48.840
we're going to see other game companies start to release their game music legitimately on

19:48.840 --> 19:49.840
iTunes.

19:49.840 --> 19:52.800
Now I know there are legitimate methods out there, but you know what?

19:52.800 --> 19:56.800
not reward the people who bring us the music? And, you know, sometimes getting the music

19:56.800 --> 19:59.640
illegitimately can kind of be a pain in the ass, because, you know, people aren't seating

19:59.640 --> 20:04.960
on BitTorrent or WinMX or NAQ, whatever it is. It's worth the 99 cents just to pull the

20:04.960 --> 20:09.040
song right away, I think. Especially considering that these CDs cost usually twice as much

20:09.040 --> 20:12.320
to import. So that's kind of exciting news. What do you think about that? I know you're

20:12.320 --> 20:13.720
not a big iTunes user, but...

20:13.720 --> 20:19.660
I'm not an iTunes user at all. On the converse, you, you know, try to download a 14-track

20:19.660 --> 20:28.740
CD and you end up paying $14 for this 14-track CD. You know what $14 can do? It can buy me

20:28.740 --> 20:35.340
lunch and dinner. Instead, I can go out, oh wait, I already have those CDs.

20:35.340 --> 20:40.580
But that's how much you'd buy if you bought it at the record store too, you know? Usually

20:40.580 --> 20:45.460
iTunes, if you buy something like an album, it's typically not as if you bought it all

20:45.460 --> 20:48.980
one try. So typically it's a discounted price for the whole album. I don't think I've ever

20:48.980 --> 20:55.400
seen any like above 1299 so it's actually a I was reading some of the

20:55.400 --> 20:59.200
British gaming news it's actually a game coming out I'm interested I was gonna I

20:59.200 --> 21:02.040
was gonna ask you what's going on for our UK fans who are listening what's

21:02.040 --> 21:04.460
going on in the British gaming world I haven't found too much different from

21:04.460 --> 21:09.840
what I read last week and I did however find some news that hip games is

21:09.840 --> 21:16.380
releasing Call of Cthulhu destiny's end hmm as a survival horror game who we

21:16.380 --> 21:20.300
like survival horror games. And where I actually never did read any of the

21:20.300 --> 21:26.300
Lovecraft, you know, stories. I do know of Cthulhu because I've played Call of Cthulhu

21:26.300 --> 21:34.240
roleplay, and I'm actually looking forward to a Call of Cthulhu game. But you can play

21:34.240 --> 21:41.520
as either a character named Emily or Jacob, who go back to this town called

21:41.520 --> 21:48.360
N's mouth to check these ruins there so you are playing as one or the other hmm

21:48.360 --> 21:53.480
and it's supposed to be pretty unique you know I consider if it's if it's

21:53.480 --> 21:59.120
based off of you know Lovecraft it's gonna blow Resident Evil and Silent Hill

21:59.120 --> 22:07.720
away. I love Silent Hill. That's fighting words. But if they do it right because the Cthulhu stuff is

22:07.720 --> 22:12.160
like really freaking spooky I don't know I still love my silent hill I'm so

22:12.160 --> 22:18.440
excited about the movie but no no coke through any release date let me see are

22:18.440 --> 22:22.480
we gonna get that here I hope so that's not just a UK I've never heard of hip

22:22.480 --> 22:27.640
games I'm scheduled to lunch in 2006 this is gonna be next year hope we get

22:27.640 --> 22:33.600
it all right and lastly tonight with e3 coming next week and us podcasting from

22:33.600 --> 22:37.280
there one thing that people always talk about it e3 and you see on the TV

22:37.280 --> 22:42.160
The Booth Babes at E3, Dark Soccer, I know you're excited about the Booth Babes.

22:42.160 --> 22:44.120
I need me some Booth boys.

22:44.120 --> 22:46.720
Well, this is interesting.

22:46.720 --> 22:52.700
Age Tech has launched an anti-Booth Babe campaign.

22:52.700 --> 22:56.760
They believe that Booth Babes take attention away from the games and they want to take

22:56.760 --> 23:00.120
the focus back to where it should be.

23:00.120 --> 23:03.840
They're refusing in fact to have Booth Babes at the show and what they're going to do,

23:03.840 --> 23:09.540
going to hire 10 unattractive women to work their booth. Gee, if I were one of those women

23:09.540 --> 23:11.680
right now, I'd feel real good about myself.

23:11.680 --> 23:12.960
I'd be kind of insulted.

23:12.960 --> 23:18.200
I know, me too. That's kind of like, I'm like with the story, I'm like, okay, okay, cool,

23:18.200 --> 23:25.120
okay, and then I'm like, oh, well, you assholes. Well, whatever. H-Tech, of course, they make

23:25.120 --> 23:31.160
video games and hardware for console systems. They launched anti-boothbabes.com. All they

23:31.160 --> 23:35.520
have right now though is an order form for a free t-shirt but perhaps by the

23:35.520 --> 23:40.420
time you hear this podcast they may have something a little more age text anti

23:40.420 --> 23:43.600
babes as they're calling them they're gonna hand out granny panties that have

23:43.600 --> 23:48.000
age text logos on it that is funny now that's kind of funny see that story goes

23:48.000 --> 23:52.360
like cool suck cool I don't know I don't why don't they just have booth guys

23:52.360 --> 23:57.280
there's a booth boys I don't know I don't get it maybe because the Marines

23:57.280 --> 24:00.200
are gonna be there and that they're considered the Marines are gonna be

24:00.200 --> 24:07.120
there exactly okay I'm I'm I'm gonna try and get my picture with as many booth

24:07.120 --> 24:12.640
babes as possible again this year by the way we have to make like the the Robin

and you know, Loki's not here,

24:55.580 --> 24:56.680
oh, excuse me, and everything,

24:56.680 --> 25:00.320
and we gotta do three, so I'm excited about that.

25:00.320 --> 25:03.400
That's it, my final thought would be,

25:03.400 --> 25:06.680
it's gonna be a wild ride, and I'm Disneyland.

25:06.680 --> 25:08.440
I'm so excited about Disneyland.

25:08.440 --> 25:12.000
Eating at the, whatever, the Boo Bayou place.

25:12.000 --> 25:15.400
I wanna find the Tiki Tiki Tiki room, for one.

25:15.400 --> 25:16.240
But the other thing I wanna find,

25:16.240 --> 25:18.180
I wanna find the place that sells liquor.

25:18.180 --> 25:19.980
Even though it's supposed to be invite only, I don't care.
