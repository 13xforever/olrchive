00:29.056 --> 00:31.157
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, Jamie Summers DarkSakura, Jamie Summers

00:57.405 --> 01:07.429
[SPEAKER_02]: First off, go figure, neither of the hotels we're staying at, because we're actually across two separate hotels, the three of us, neither of them have Wi-Fi access, so that does us no good there.

01:07.789 --> 01:15.652
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the internet cafe that is up the street from where Loki and I are staying was closed yesterday, and we were thinking, oh, we'll just upload it over there.

01:15.972 --> 01:16.612
[SPEAKER_02]: No, they're closed.

01:16.652 --> 01:21.033
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had to wait, and today we uploaded it from the E3 Business Center, so we finally got it up there.

01:21.394 --> 01:25.195
[SPEAKER_02]: So you guys actually won't hear this until Friday morning, so we apologize for that delay.

01:26.216 --> 01:33.325
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, it happens, and we're still bringing you the coverage faster than 99.9% of the other sites out there on the internet.

01:33.345 --> 01:34.426
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're really excited about that.

01:34.446 --> 01:40.874
[SPEAKER_02]: And we also want to give a big thank you to Jason, our webmaster, who is helping us out on the other end and getting these podcasts to you guys.

01:40.894 --> 01:41.875
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay, Jason!

01:41.895 --> 01:42.436
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay!

01:42.837 --> 01:43.117
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

01:43.829 --> 01:45.271
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's talk about Thursday.

01:45.331 --> 01:46.913
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you guys feeling after today?

01:46.993 --> 01:49.535
[SPEAKER_02]: Two-thirds of the showdown, only Friday to go.

01:49.876 --> 01:54.601
[SPEAKER_02]: Today is the longest day of E3 as well, going from 9 o'clock in the morning to 6 o'clock in the evening.

01:55.021 --> 01:56.503
[SPEAKER_02]: I know Loki and I were there all day.

01:56.583 --> 01:57.845
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie, did you get there at 9 o'clock too?

01:58.886 --> 02:01.689
[SPEAKER_03]: Got there around 10-something actually because we went to breakfast.

02:03.683 --> 02:04.044
[SPEAKER_02]: Not us.

02:04.184 --> 02:05.505
[SPEAKER_02]: We kind of skipped breakfast.

02:05.525 --> 02:09.569
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually ended up eating pizza at about 11.30 or so.

02:09.649 --> 02:10.590
[SPEAKER_02]: No, even before that.

02:10.810 --> 02:11.931
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like 10.30 or something?

02:12.232 --> 02:12.892
[SPEAKER_02]: It was about 10.30.

02:13.613 --> 02:24.644
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason behind that is if you don't eat at E3 super early in the day or super late in the day, you will be waiting in line for a long time as LankyStyle from the other show and I

02:25.044 --> 02:35.666
[SPEAKER_02]: found out on Wednesday we waited in line for like 45 minutes to get an $8 hamburger and fries which is like even worse quality than you'd get at Burger King.

02:36.146 --> 02:40.027
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's one thing if you guys are planning on going to E3 in the future.

02:40.387 --> 02:42.787
[SPEAKER_02]: Eat early, eat late, or sneak your food in.

02:42.807 --> 02:43.127
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

02:44.148 --> 02:44.628
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

02:44.808 --> 02:47.308
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually ate a hamburger too just without the bun.

02:47.508 --> 02:48.288
[SPEAKER_03]: She gave me two patties.

02:48.308 --> 02:49.689
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a cheeseburger.

02:51.049 --> 02:52.229
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was still $8 though, right?

02:53.735 --> 02:55.283
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but I got twice as much food as you did

02:56.680 --> 03:00.563
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, I want to just say to you guys real quick, we are having another technical difficulty night.

03:00.603 --> 03:06.587
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually only have one microphone, so if you have a couple of clanks and weird volume things, it's just because we're passing it back and forth.

03:06.647 --> 03:11.871
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, we want to bring you guys the up-to-the-minute news, so we're just kind of making do with it.

03:11.991 --> 03:12.512
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, Loki.

03:13.612 --> 03:24.460
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, remember, if you're coming to E3 to buy food, bring cash, because I don't know why, but after about a couple hours after they open, they're just like, you know, we don't want to have to worry about...

03:26.744 --> 03:29.625
[SPEAKER_01]: doing our credit cards and whatnot.

03:29.745 --> 03:31.766
[SPEAKER_01]: So, to hell with it.

03:32.166 --> 03:35.087
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're screwed because you have your food and you're like, oh, can I pay the credit?

03:35.728 --> 03:35.968
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

03:37.008 --> 03:37.528
[SPEAKER_01]: Aw, crap.

03:38.909 --> 03:40.289
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you're stuck in that awkward moment.

03:40.970 --> 03:41.970
[SPEAKER_01]: Luckily, I always bring cash.

03:44.229 --> 03:46.251
[SPEAKER_02]: Just one of the fun things.

03:47.412 --> 03:53.676
[SPEAKER_02]: One other thing I've got to say about all that is, you notice that around the LA Convention Center, there is no fast food whatsoever.

03:53.936 --> 03:56.678
[SPEAKER_02]: No McDonald's, no Burger King, within a reasonable walking distance.

03:56.778 --> 03:57.098
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing.

03:57.519 --> 04:00.261
[SPEAKER_02]: You think they do that on purpose so that you're kind of forced to eat those?

04:00.381 --> 04:03.843
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard they chased away a hot dog vendor today, too, that wasn't licensed.

04:04.283 --> 04:05.264
[SPEAKER_02]: They fear competition.

04:06.905 --> 04:10.688
[SPEAKER_03]: You buy their overpriced, crappy butt food.

04:12.148 --> 04:13.309
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, enough talk about food.

04:13.349 --> 04:13.949
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, guys.

04:13.969 --> 04:15.130
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's move on to the games.

04:15.170 --> 04:16.751
[SPEAKER_02]: The games are what we really want to talk about.

04:17.571 --> 04:18.972
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do what we did yesterday.

04:19.032 --> 04:24.035
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about three interesting games that we saw today at E3, three things we played and enjoy.

04:24.395 --> 04:26.356
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go around and start with Loki, three games.

04:27.168 --> 04:27.648
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, no, wait.

04:27.728 --> 04:28.609
[SPEAKER_02]: You stole mine yesterday.

04:28.629 --> 04:29.469
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm starting off today.

04:30.149 --> 04:32.470
[SPEAKER_02]: Three games I played today that I enjoyed.

04:32.630 --> 04:37.011
[SPEAKER_02]: First off, Castlevania DS I actually checked out today and thought it was pretty cool.

04:37.071 --> 04:41.093
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the way that you can kind of draw to defeat the boss.

04:41.133 --> 04:42.113
[SPEAKER_02]: It was kind of interesting.

04:42.673 --> 04:56.238
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of DS games to date, they've relied solely on the touch, I think, the touch element of the game, whereas Castlevania DS, it was a Castlevania game like you'd see on the Game Boy Advance with your map or subscreen shown at the top.

04:56.678 --> 04:57.779
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

05:14.233 --> 05:17.377
[SPEAKER_02]: Which was interesting, it was different, but some of the songs in it were really weird.

05:17.717 --> 05:22.163
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, the song I played was Headstrong, and I don't even remember who sings that, because I don't listen to mainstream music.

05:22.563 --> 05:25.106
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um... Headstrong, yeah, whatever.

05:26.108 --> 05:28.891
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was weird to hear that in Donkey Konga, though, of all things.

05:29.432 --> 05:29.812
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, um...

05:32.963 --> 05:33.664
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to think what else.

05:33.704 --> 05:35.346
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yes, one pleasant surprise.

05:36.086 --> 05:42.252
[SPEAKER_02]: The first thing I saw this morning over at Midway's booth, I played Mortal Kombat Shaolin Monks, which I wasn't sure what to expect from that.

05:42.292 --> 05:48.378
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was just going to be another Mortal Kombat game, but it's more like Mortal Kombat in the, I don't know if this is a fair comparison.

05:48.678 --> 05:53.399
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the Devil May Cry sense, where you're walking around and you're just, like, beating things up.

05:53.859 --> 06:03.021
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's kind of cool because if you pick up a weapon, like, in Total Mortal Kombat style, you're lobbing off heads and arms and all that fun stuff, and you get to do fatalities.

06:03.341 --> 06:06.082
[SPEAKER_02]: I was actually really pleasantly surprised with Mortal Kombat Shalamus.

06:06.122 --> 06:08.262
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually one of those few games I see that I'm like, you know what?

06:08.302 --> 06:09.683
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to have to buy this when it comes out.

06:10.003 --> 06:13.963
[SPEAKER_02]: But, of course, I've always been kind of a Mortal Kombat fan, I guess.

06:14.424 --> 06:15.664
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are my three.

06:15.744 --> 06:15.944
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki.

06:16.984 --> 06:18.505
[SPEAKER_01]: It was Mortal Kombat of War.

06:19.146 --> 06:19.987
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what it was.

06:20.367 --> 06:23.169
[SPEAKER_01]: Because everyone's got to do the God of War, Devil May Cry game.

06:23.309 --> 06:25.571
[SPEAKER_01]: Even Disney, but I haven't played that one yet.

06:26.372 --> 06:31.396
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that That's So Raven 2, where Raven Simones just starts coming out and kicking the crap out of everybody?

06:32.356 --> 06:32.797
[SPEAKER_02]: You wish.

06:32.857 --> 06:35.939
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that would be the Nightmare Before Christmas game.

06:38.581 --> 06:40.063
[SPEAKER_01]: Raven Simones and Nightmare Before Christmas?

06:40.083 --> 06:40.163
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

06:40.703 --> 06:41.704
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like driving in LA for reals.

07:08.135 --> 07:10.237
[SPEAKER_01]: It was unclear where the hell you're supposed to be going.

07:10.297 --> 07:25.873
[SPEAKER_01]: You actually had to look at your map and look at these checkpoints that they had that resembled something from either, say, Grand Theft Auto during your checkpoint race missions or whatever, or Midnight Club, the original Midnight Club, where you have this beam of light coming.

07:26.534 --> 07:29.697
[SPEAKER_01]: So you see it off in the distance, but you're like, how the hell do I get there?

07:30.397 --> 07:31.678
[SPEAKER_01]: and a lot of times I got lost.

07:32.058 --> 07:33.818
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just not fun in that sense.

07:34.299 --> 07:38.640
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other annoying thing is every time you get in a high-speed car crash, they do a slow-mo instant replay.

07:39.600 --> 07:40.861
[SPEAKER_01]: Annoying as hell.

07:41.201 --> 07:43.282
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure, ooh, it looks cool, but guess what?

07:43.362 --> 07:46.523
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not Burnout, so stop trying to be like Burnout, okay?

07:46.763 --> 07:47.263
[SPEAKER_01]: You're L.A.

07:47.343 --> 07:47.603
[SPEAKER_01]: Rush.

07:47.943 --> 07:51.145
[SPEAKER_01]: San Francisco Rush, you know, unrealistic, you know, loops and stuff.

07:51.525 --> 07:52.965
[SPEAKER_01]: That is what I expect from L.A.

07:53.045 --> 07:53.265
[SPEAKER_01]: Rush.

07:53.686 --> 07:54.626
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not what I got.

07:55.768 --> 07:56.489
[SPEAKER_01]: Shadow of the Hedgehog

08:26.189 --> 08:30.714
[SPEAKER_01]: I was, once again, not very impressed by the hands and feet mode.

08:30.874 --> 08:31.995
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it was retarded.

08:32.015 --> 08:34.458
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no, no.

08:34.518 --> 08:36.180
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just pissed off because you failed your song.

08:36.460 --> 08:41.186
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're also pissed off that when I played in the heat of the night expert into hands and feet mode that I got a crowd.

08:41.426 --> 08:43.168
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, don't go there.

08:43.683 --> 08:45.044
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, your big three from today, Thursday

09:12.341 --> 09:13.563
[SPEAKER_03]: My big three.

09:13.723 --> 09:17.708
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm not, you know, I looked at a whole bunch of stuff.

09:18.229 --> 09:19.050
[SPEAKER_03]: I played a few.

09:20.212 --> 09:23.376
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to completely just gush over Kingdom Hearts 2.

09:24.978 --> 09:26.340
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it was Kingdom Hearts 2.

09:27.261 --> 09:28.082
[SPEAKER_03]: It was so cool.

09:28.903 --> 09:40.488
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, are you gushing because it's Kingdom Hearts, or are you gushing like everybody made this giant gush sound in the Squeenix show when you saw that Johnny Depp as, what was his character in Pirates of the Caribbean?

09:40.568 --> 09:41.928
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't see the movie, I have to be honest.

09:42.469 --> 09:43.189
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't get out much.

09:43.429 --> 09:45.650
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, thank you, Jack Sparrow is actually in Kingdom Hearts.

09:45.710 --> 09:48.191
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody made this big gush when Jack Sparrow came on screen.

09:48.911 --> 09:51.472
[SPEAKER_03]: Spoiler, thank you, I was gonna go to that tomorrow.

09:55.034 --> 09:55.554
[SPEAKER_03]: You bitch.

09:57.386 --> 09:59.207
[SPEAKER_02]: It was on the internet before they showed it.

10:00.747 --> 10:04.288
[SPEAKER_03]: I usually spend my internet time reading world news and events, sir.

10:05.428 --> 10:06.129
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

10:08.409 --> 10:09.189
[SPEAKER_01]: It was an event.

10:11.490 --> 10:15.191
[SPEAKER_03]: It was an event the way that me waking up in the morning and farting is an event.

10:16.932 --> 10:21.953
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you looking up world events like, oh no, Ben Affleck got Jennifer Garner pregnant, oh my lord.

10:22.713 --> 10:24.814
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's your Yahoo, not mine.

10:26.425 --> 10:27.646
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen your Yahoo.

10:28.666 --> 10:31.828
[SPEAKER_03]: Your Yahoo is Britney Spears is knocked up!

10:33.049 --> 10:37.131
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sorry, I have Ben Affleck dot com feeding right into my Yahoo.

10:37.632 --> 10:37.892
[SPEAKER_02]: Bitch.

10:38.532 --> 10:40.493
[SPEAKER_03]: My Yahoo just is depressing every day.

10:41.214 --> 10:42.054
[SPEAKER_03]: War!

10:42.795 --> 10:43.695
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, anyway.

10:46.197 --> 10:47.978
[SPEAKER_02]: You had to find out someday, I'm sorry.

10:48.278 --> 10:49.058
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

10:49.238 --> 10:50.079
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm making pouty faces.

10:50.159 --> 10:51.320
[SPEAKER_03]: I was gonna find out tomorrow.

10:51.820 --> 10:52.280
[SPEAKER_03]: Give me a dollar.

10:54.241 --> 10:55.162
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, anyway, anyway.

10:55.666 --> 11:03.271
[SPEAKER_03]: Kingdom Hearts 2 is pretty, and it's very, I mean, it's really, it retains the same graphic style.

11:03.651 --> 11:08.234
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's pretty much on with the last one, except you can tell it does more in subtle ways.

11:09.355 --> 11:10.976
[SPEAKER_03]: First of all, I have to mention this.

11:11.236 --> 11:12.597
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what made me really bouncy.

11:12.877 --> 11:14.478
[SPEAKER_03]: I went over to Squenix.

11:15.399 --> 11:16.119
[SPEAKER_03]: No pictures!

11:16.420 --> 11:17.160
[SPEAKER_03]: No pictures!

11:17.500 --> 11:20.422
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we're gonna hide the game from the world.

11:21.443 --> 11:24.405
[SPEAKER_02]: And I haven't seen a single other booth say you can't take pictures.

11:25.871 --> 11:28.412
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, PlayStation did the same thing.

11:29.833 --> 11:30.613
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, F them both.

11:31.773 --> 11:32.033
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

11:32.634 --> 11:35.435
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, so I trot over to Buena Vista today.

11:35.575 --> 11:39.276
[SPEAKER_03]: I look around, no one's there, so I start playing and take a picture.

11:39.576 --> 11:46.279
[SPEAKER_03]: Guy's like, I'll play for you while you take pictures and I'll show you the cool shit so you can take pictures of them.

11:47.506 --> 11:49.628
[SPEAKER_03]: And I wanted to actually get his name and everything.

11:49.648 --> 11:51.830
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, no, I don't actually work for Buena Vista.

11:52.010 --> 11:53.131
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm more of a correspondent.

11:53.211 --> 11:56.274
[SPEAKER_03]: So I said, I'll credit you as that nice guy at the Buena Vista booth.

11:56.314 --> 11:57.275
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you, nice guy.

11:59.516 --> 12:05.842
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, he showed me you can actually fuse with other characters in your party.

12:06.262 --> 12:09.285
[SPEAKER_03]: And actually, it's really cool when you fuse with Goofy because you get the valor.

12:09.305 --> 12:10.085
[SPEAKER_03]: Spoiler!

12:10.106 --> 12:10.626
That was a spoiler!

12:12.167 --> 12:12.568
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

12:13.548 --> 12:13.809
[SPEAKER_03]: Bitch.

12:15.438 --> 12:22.800
[SPEAKER_03]: You get the Valor, and he wears this red outfit, and he wields two Keyblades.

12:23.701 --> 12:25.921
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was pretty cool, and he's got all this power.

12:26.621 --> 12:32.343
[SPEAKER_03]: And he did the Mulan level, he did the level where Hades is trying to kick your ass, but the Mulan level was cool.

12:32.898 --> 12:36.321
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, you know the scene where, who was the bad guy in Mulan?

12:36.801 --> 12:37.882
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember his name.

12:38.242 --> 12:41.084
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, he comes over the hill and there's a few of his army there.

12:41.464 --> 12:42.325
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're like, oh, okay.

12:42.365 --> 12:42.905
[SPEAKER_03]: And they rush.

12:42.985 --> 12:44.907
[SPEAKER_03]: And then a bajillion of them rush over the hill.

12:45.667 --> 12:47.789
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, instead it was a bunch of the Heartless.

12:49.016 --> 13:14.524
[SPEAKER_03]: and we're talking like there were easily several hundred on the screen at that time attacking you and you just have to outlast the clock at this point but there and I've got several pictures of it they're gonna be online when we get back unless somebody is kind enough to take them back beforehand but there was just so many on screen I was really impressed I mean I

13:15.598 --> 13:17.002
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, we are all over the place.

13:17.122 --> 13:19.047
[SPEAKER_03]: We are yellow and ugly and we're trying to kick your ass.

13:19.528 --> 13:20.089
[SPEAKER_03]: That type of thing.

13:20.731 --> 13:21.753
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was really cool.

13:21.814 --> 13:23.919
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I got to get into one of the media events.

13:24.972 --> 13:31.776
[SPEAKER_03]: I got, because I went over there, because I talked about Call of Cthulhu the other night, when we did our last actual podcast.

13:31.856 --> 13:39.141
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I had, I found out where Bethesda was, and I was like, you know, I like, I've been looking at this Call of Cthulhu thing, and it looks pretty groovy.

13:39.621 --> 13:41.582
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, well, okay, come on in.

13:42.082 --> 13:47.846
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I sat there with the other press people, and the guy was playing through it, and I was like, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.

13:48.346 --> 13:55.013
[SPEAKER_03]: Call of Cthulhu looks cool, but the best thing about it, visually, it's about 80% done.

13:56.195 --> 13:59.779
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I got some more stats on it.

13:59.999 --> 14:02.402
[SPEAKER_03]: I do believe he said out in either August or September.

14:03.423 --> 14:04.704
[SPEAKER_03]: You have an insanity meter.

14:05.365 --> 14:07.988
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, the main character was a policeman who went insane.

14:08.849 --> 14:11.531
[SPEAKER_03]: And then he got out of the asylum and became a detective.

14:12.151 --> 14:26.824
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, when you see shocking images, like in one scene there was a ghoul pinned to a cross in this church, or when you're being chased, your insanity level goes up.

14:27.385 --> 14:30.307
[SPEAKER_03]: And your screen starts getting wavy, you start getting tunnel vision.

14:30.828 --> 14:32.149
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you hallucinate!

14:32.843 --> 14:38.643
[SPEAKER_03]: There's one scene where he's running down a tunnel, all of a sudden he's running through the halls of the asylum he was trapped in.

14:39.480 --> 14:47.883
[SPEAKER_03]: Or when you enter a new scene, if your insanity level is high enough, then you get flashes of where all the enemies in the area are.

14:48.704 --> 14:50.324
[SPEAKER_03]: And he says there's two ways of doing each level.

14:50.364 --> 14:54.386
[SPEAKER_03]: You can do it the right way, the sneaky way that, you know, takes a little bit longer.

14:55.346 --> 14:58.007
[SPEAKER_03]: Or you can just rush through everything, guns blazing.

14:58.287 --> 15:01.228
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, he said that the sneaky way actually tends to be a little bit shorter.

15:01.729 --> 15:03.589
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'll have more information on that.

15:03.609 --> 15:04.650
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to do a write-up on it.

15:04.870 --> 15:07.171
[SPEAKER_03]: You can all see it on OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

15:07.491 --> 15:07.911
[SPEAKER_03]: Plug, plug.

15:08.791 --> 15:12.114
[SPEAKER_03]: and hear me gush about it on Pump Up the Volume later on.

15:13.475 --> 15:15.557
[SPEAKER_02]: So Kingdom Hearts 2, Call of Cthulhu, you got one more?

15:16.938 --> 15:18.399
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh shit, you said three, right?

15:22.342 --> 15:23.663
[SPEAKER_03]: The Cybersex Game!

15:25.145 --> 15:27.407
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, no, I didn't say that.

15:30.429 --> 15:32.230
[SPEAKER_03]: But you guys were just funny about it.

15:32.270 --> 15:34.112
[SPEAKER_03]: Matt was funny about it because I was like,

15:34.718 --> 15:38.560
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me get into the next topic, because I know we want to talk next about... Oh, wait, you thought of another one?

15:39.400 --> 15:45.403
[SPEAKER_03]: I still have to go back and say that Shadow the Hedgehog was pretty groovy-looking.

15:46.103 --> 15:47.744
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no, I know what it was, my other game.

15:48.624 --> 15:49.745
[SPEAKER_03]: Gunstar Super Heroes.

15:50.325 --> 15:52.606
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's just Gunstar Heroes, and that's all.

15:54.387 --> 15:59.109
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well, Jamie spoiled a little bit of our next segment the most int... Spoiler!

15:59.189 --> 16:00.450
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my OMG!

16:00.530 --> 16:01.310
[SPEAKER_02]: Spoiler, spoiler!

16:01.330 --> 16:02.471
[SPEAKER_02]: Bite my ass!

16:03.300 --> 16:08.695
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so what I want to talk about now is the most interesting moment of your E3 day.

16:08.895 --> 16:11.442
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll start with Loki since this got spoiled, OMG.

16:13.058 --> 16:14.359
[SPEAKER_01]: I was gonna talk about that?

16:14.579 --> 16:14.900
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, well.

16:15.320 --> 16:22.486
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, um, yeah, so, I went to this one booth that they had there, it was right next to X-Tango, which is the game we talked about last year.

16:22.846 --> 16:26.089
[SPEAKER_01]: It was pretty cool, so it's a tango music game, sort of like Bust a Move.

16:26.809 --> 16:34.856
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, and, um, now there's this, like, cybersex game called, uh, oh man, Feel Free.

16:35.837 --> 16:37.658
[SPEAKER_01]: And, anyways, um, so basically...

16:38.760 --> 16:44.881
[SPEAKER_01]: The game, I don't really know what the premise was because I only got to see it for a very brief time.

16:47.149 --> 16:52.992
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, basically, you had... It sort of reminded me of The Sims, but you had different things.

16:53.353 --> 16:56.134
[SPEAKER_01]: You were kind of controlling the girl you were talking to or something.

16:56.634 --> 17:01.257
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you could, like, you know, the guy would start dancing and you'd click D or whatever to make her dance.

17:01.317 --> 17:05.279
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you could do different, like, provocative dance stuff.

17:05.359 --> 17:10.362
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he's like, oh, he's all... Because there's this Asian guy that spoke no English.

17:10.402 --> 17:13.224
[SPEAKER_01]: He's all real brief English.

17:13.444 --> 17:13.904
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like...

17:14.504 --> 17:39.631
[SPEAKER_01]: Click here to see, it takes her top off, okay, so I clicked, I clicked here, it took her top off, I'm like, oh, that's kind of cool, so he was just letting me play around with it, so I clicked their shorts, or her mini skirt, and then that came off, and then all hell broke loose, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, that's illegal, no, no, no, and then, so they had, like, someone come over to translate, and she's like, no, you can't do that, because it's, it's illegal, or something like that, I'm like, okay,

17:41.306 --> 17:44.548
[SPEAKER_02]: One other thing I thought was interesting about that game, and I don't remember the name of it.

17:44.588 --> 17:45.489
[SPEAKER_02]: Does anybody recall?

17:45.529 --> 17:46.630
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on my camera somewhere.

17:46.650 --> 17:48.171
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll post more information on the site.

17:48.251 --> 17:49.692
[SPEAKER_02]: Field 3, I think was the name of it.

17:50.092 --> 17:52.134
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it Cyber Entertainment was the name of the booth, I think?

17:52.794 --> 17:54.796
[SPEAKER_02]: It's important, but this is the other thing.

17:55.216 --> 18:00.600
[SPEAKER_02]: So not only is it like a cyber sex sim, it has webcam windows in the upper left and upper right.

18:00.980 --> 18:05.203
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can go virtual, and you can go like...

18:06.042 --> 18:08.745
[SPEAKER_02]: Really virtual, like, really interactive.

18:09.105 --> 18:13.609
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of scary because there's people that are really going to benefit from this game, and that makes me sad a bit.

18:14.390 --> 18:18.013
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm thinking one person controls the guy, the other one controls the girl.

18:18.033 --> 18:19.054
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what it seems like.

18:19.274 --> 18:24.339
[SPEAKER_02]: You do understand when this game comes out, they're both going to be controlled by guys, whether you know it or not.

18:25.640 --> 18:27.181
[SPEAKER_01]: You can tell there's the camera.

18:27.221 --> 18:28.142
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why they have it.

18:28.242 --> 18:29.563
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the dude camera.

18:30.004 --> 18:32.026
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing a wig and a little makeup can't hide.

18:33.616 --> 18:42.291
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing than holding a photo up in front of your webcam Yeah, I'll just loop this Jenna Jameson footage I taped off the TV a little while ago

18:43.993 --> 18:46.554
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, the most interesting thing you saw today.

18:46.574 --> 18:48.655
[SPEAKER_01]: Or interesting experience.

19:18.269 --> 19:20.569
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to play with the Katamari today.

19:21.289 --> 19:27.611
[SPEAKER_03]: And I got to put our media sampler on the Katamari and then you got to put the reject false icon sticker on there for me.

19:27.691 --> 19:29.252
[SPEAKER_03]: It made me feel like a happy fan.

19:30.532 --> 19:31.772
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the Katamari!

19:32.312 --> 19:37.834
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I got to climb all over stuff and actually get into media stuff without actually being media passes.

19:38.254 --> 19:38.734
[SPEAKER_03]: That was pretty cool.

19:40.456 --> 19:45.700
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, when I put your sticker on the Katamari, they actually gave me a Katamari Damacy 2 mouse pad.

19:45.920 --> 19:49.302
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they gave me another one because I went back to play the game with Miklatov.

19:49.342 --> 19:50.403
[SPEAKER_02]: I went back to play it again later.

19:50.423 --> 19:51.263
[SPEAKER_02]: They gave me a second one.

19:51.584 --> 19:55.846
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm thinking about maybe doing a little giveaway in the near future for one of our lucky fans.

19:55.866 --> 19:56.227
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

19:57.488 --> 20:01.951
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, now that I remember, there's actually something else that I was going to say was my most interesting moment.

20:02.831 --> 20:03.552
[SPEAKER_03]: That was my massage.

20:05.677 --> 20:10.799
[SPEAKER_03]: I went out, well, I got the free one, the Tylenol Ouch booth thing, and that was all cool.

20:10.839 --> 20:14.900
[SPEAKER_03]: And the guy worked on my hip, you know, because I was in that car accident, and I was really in pain.

20:15.720 --> 20:18.521
[SPEAKER_03]: But I went back after, this is about an hour after my bike had been kicked in.

20:20.202 --> 20:24.263
[SPEAKER_03]: But I went back and paid for like a 25-minute full massage.

20:25.103 --> 20:31.105
[SPEAKER_03]: And my masseur was an actual stand-up comedian.

20:32.210 --> 20:35.193
[SPEAKER_03]: So when he was giving me my foot run, he was making me laugh.

20:35.934 --> 20:37.295
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to L.A., everybody.

20:39.997 --> 20:47.524
[SPEAKER_03]: But I like what he said, that making somebody laugh is a serious business.

20:48.525 --> 20:49.887
[SPEAKER_03]: And we got to talking about how...

20:52.892 --> 21:03.915
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but we got to a discussion on how if you live your life all stressed out and you don't laugh and you don't do anything for yourself, you're going to die, okay?

21:03.975 --> 21:11.217
[SPEAKER_03]: You're just going to get cancer of the lower intestine and die not able to shit on your own.

21:14.558 --> 21:18.599
[SPEAKER_02]: What a pleasant image to paint for all these people who are tuning in to hear the latest game news.

21:18.659 --> 21:19.080
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

21:19.480 --> 21:20.260
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, no, no, no, no.

21:25.679 --> 21:43.270
[SPEAKER_03]: Those of us who take time to enjoy our lives, take time to laugh, take time to play games, stress relief, have some leisurely time, those are the people who are generally going to have a happier outlook and who are going to live longer lives, at least unless a car hits them.

21:45.266 --> 21:47.329
[SPEAKER_02]: Point and laugh, it'll add five years to your life

22:04.403 --> 22:05.464
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

22:23.977 --> 22:26.858
[SPEAKER_02]: In some ways it's a little more fun, but it can also be a lot of work.

22:27.058 --> 22:28.999
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been on that side of it studying in colleges.

22:29.019 --> 22:29.719
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's a lot of work.

22:30.219 --> 22:37.362
[SPEAKER_02]: But my dad really, really likes it because he's been following the screensavers ever since it was Leo Lepore and then it transitioned and transitioned.

22:37.422 --> 22:38.342
[SPEAKER_02]: He's moved along with it.

22:38.382 --> 22:39.582
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it's this attack of the show.

22:39.622 --> 22:43.544
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was like, okay, my dad's really excited for me to be here.

22:43.864 --> 22:44.424
[SPEAKER_02]: Aw, moment.

22:44.704 --> 22:46.085
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to go get him an autograph.

22:46.125 --> 22:47.605
[SPEAKER_02]: So I went and I got him an autograph.

22:48.025 --> 22:53.467
[SPEAKER_02]: And I told Sarah Lane while I had him on because they were nice and they chatted up with us a little bit while we were each kind of waiting for our autograph.

22:53.823 --> 22:56.785
[SPEAKER_02]: And Sarah Lane asked me and said, you know, how are you?

22:56.845 --> 23:00.827
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, oh, fine, you know, I'm getting this from my dad, if you can make it out to him.

23:01.067 --> 23:04.148
[SPEAKER_02]: And he has a little bit of a crush on you, which, you know, is kind of nice.

23:04.809 --> 23:10.892
[SPEAKER_02]: And she goes, oh, uh-huh, well, thank you, Alan, wink wink, because that's Alan's, my dad's name.

23:11.412 --> 23:15.514
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, I would have been all like, dude, I swear it's not me, I'm gay.

23:15.734 --> 23:17.215
[SPEAKER_02]: But I didn't want to make an awkward moment.

23:17.255 --> 23:18.497
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it might have been an awkward moment.

23:18.637 --> 23:21.920
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, guys, if you're listening, because Matt ended up slipping something.

23:22.841 --> 23:26.504
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, your name tag doesn't say Alan.

23:27.064 --> 23:29.767
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, hi, Alan.

23:29.947 --> 23:31.569
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Alan's my stage name.

23:32.550 --> 23:35.652
[SPEAKER_02]: I think she was just trying to be cute, so I totally respect her for that.

23:36.013 --> 23:40.377
[SPEAKER_02]: But, yeah, it was kind of one of those things where it's like, you know, I could...

23:41.303 --> 23:42.004
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

23:57.097 --> 24:06.713
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought G4's booth, all things considered, because they've taken a lot of heat ever since the tech TV, I thought they actually had kind of an interesting booth where you could kind of play the actual Nintendo and everything.

24:07.033 --> 24:09.497
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Matt ended up seizing this opportunity.

24:09.538 --> 24:11.381
[SPEAKER_02]: What did you do, Matt, while we were in line for that?

24:12.159 --> 24:18.461
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you were talking to her about what Orange Lounge Radio was, so I figured I'd just help clarify.

24:19.302 --> 24:20.522
[SPEAKER_01]: They asked!

24:20.982 --> 24:32.366
[SPEAKER_01]: So, while I was having Kevin Pira and Sarah Lane signing the picture that they gave me here, I gave them one of our media samplers for our podcast.

24:32.426 --> 24:40.129
[SPEAKER_01]: So, hello, Kevin and Sarah, or Kevin and Sarah's interns, whoever it may be that might possibly listen to the show.

24:41.209 --> 24:43.351
[SPEAKER_02]: or Kevin and Sarah's trash can for all we know.

24:43.371 --> 24:43.951
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, who knows?

24:44.531 --> 24:50.115
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, the bum row machine outside the trash picking up a CD thinking it's something valuable.

24:50.415 --> 24:52.476
[SPEAKER_01]: No, they're really cool and the booth is pretty cool.

24:52.696 --> 24:59.600
[SPEAKER_01]: In the past, I've given G4 a little bit of criticism.

24:59.800 --> 25:00.681
[SPEAKER_01]: But hey, really?

25:00.781 --> 25:04.443
[SPEAKER_01]: I figured out who the real villain of this everything is.

25:04.743 --> 25:09.506
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all Comcast because it's all their fault that my cable never works.

25:10.520 --> 25:14.983
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's face it kids, we haven't said anything everyone else on the internet hasn't already said.

25:15.243 --> 25:16.764
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, it's just, you know, anyway.

25:17.724 --> 25:22.027
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and we got filmed for some TV thing too, but I don't know, I don't remember what it was.

25:22.927 --> 25:25.028
[SPEAKER_01]: We were filmed as bumpers for...

25:26.449 --> 25:27.089
[SPEAKER_01]: What was it?

25:27.129 --> 25:28.130
[SPEAKER_01]: G4TV.com.

25:28.190 --> 25:37.814
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you find a rerun or happen to see G4TV.com, their E3 coverage, you will see us as a commercial intro or whatever.

25:38.215 --> 25:42.537
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll see us yelling and screaming because that's what we were told to do.

25:43.017 --> 25:49.940
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, we got to play with the 8-foot Nintendo controller that they built, which is cool.

25:50.380 --> 25:52.761
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm dedicated now to build one that's larger.

25:52.781 --> 25:54.082
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

25:54.901 --> 25:56.222
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because I have to.

25:57.083 --> 25:58.904
[SPEAKER_02]: Another one of those projects you'll never finish.

25:59.084 --> 26:03.308
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so tomorrow is the last day of E3.

26:03.388 --> 26:05.109
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you guys' plans?

26:05.149 --> 26:07.812
[SPEAKER_02]: Something you definitely have to check out tomorrow at E3 with the last day.

26:08.873 --> 26:10.514
[SPEAKER_03]: Sitting in the Sony line for three hours.

26:12.042 --> 26:12.823
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

26:30.163 --> 26:33.905
[SPEAKER_02]: And I realize, you know, a lot of folks are like, boy, E3 is so glamorous.

26:33.925 --> 26:35.705
[SPEAKER_02]: You get to play all the latest and greatest games.

26:35.945 --> 26:36.606
[SPEAKER_02]: And don't get me wrong.

26:36.666 --> 26:37.306
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty cool.

26:37.326 --> 26:40.327
[SPEAKER_02]: We're very lucky to be able to go to E3 and we're having a good time overall.

26:40.367 --> 26:43.729
[SPEAKER_02]: But to play the really good stuff, you guys, it's like going to Disneyland.

26:43.769 --> 26:49.591
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to ride the nice ride, you got to sit in line for three hours and, you know, for that five minute thrill.

26:49.631 --> 26:51.712
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of, you know, too bad.

26:52.837 --> 27:01.507
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still going to be getting up at 7 and trying to be over there by, well, they start at 9.

27:02.308 --> 27:04.050
[SPEAKER_03]: Try to be over there by like a quarter till.

27:04.070 --> 27:08.696
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think you're most looking forward to doing tomorrow, Loki?

27:10.287 --> 27:12.108
[SPEAKER_01]: Going home, to be honest.

27:12.649 --> 27:15.191
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, honestly, I'm done with the show right now.

27:16.491 --> 27:19.974
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought the whole line at Nintendo's booth was to see the revolution.

27:20.194 --> 27:23.817
[SPEAKER_01]: Then when I found out it's just to play the stupid Zelda game, I was like, ah, the hell with that.

27:23.917 --> 27:24.777
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not staying there.

27:25.238 --> 27:27.679
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll go see Sony because at least they're going to show the PS3.

27:27.900 --> 27:31.402
[SPEAKER_01]: Nintendo, oh, wow, you show us your ugly system, but nothing that does.

27:31.903 --> 27:37.507
[SPEAKER_01]: You hype it up and you don't come through and say, here's a little Game Boy Advance.

27:37.607 --> 27:38.307
[SPEAKER_01]: Come play it.

27:38.407 --> 27:39.228
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, ugh.

27:43.030 --> 27:49.793
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to kind of retract something I said yesterday.

27:49.853 --> 27:53.175
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually got the DS download thing in Nintendo to work better for me today.

27:53.275 --> 27:56.157
[SPEAKER_02]: And I still have Meteos on my DS because I put it in sleep mode.

27:56.417 --> 27:57.277
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of cool.

27:57.317 --> 27:59.398
[SPEAKER_02]: So I feel a little better about the DS download thing now.

28:00.479 --> 28:02.940
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to have to go back then and get Electroplankton.

28:04.021 --> 28:04.581
[SPEAKER_03]: Electroplankton.

28:06.044 --> 28:07.925
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, no one would make E3 a lot better.

28:08.266 --> 28:09.807
[SPEAKER_01]: It would make it harder to get into.

28:10.427 --> 28:13.970
[SPEAKER_01]: Because everybody is just coming in no matter what.

28:14.450 --> 28:20.035
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people that are sort of in the industry, those are the people that are coming in.

28:20.755 --> 28:27.860
[SPEAKER_01]: Granted, we are sort of in the industry, but there are some people that really are like, I work for Kmart.

28:28.281 --> 28:29.642
[SPEAKER_01]: Kmart sells video games.

28:29.782 --> 28:30.943
[SPEAKER_01]: Therefore, I get in.

28:30.963 --> 28:31.243
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

28:31.969 --> 28:32.649
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

28:52.734 --> 28:53.054
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

29:13.917 --> 29:41.162
[SPEAKER_01]: which is dumb, I mean, like, I don't even understand some of these smaller companies, like, you know, for example, oh, who's the company that does, not Crave, but, like, it's just like some of the stuff in Kentia Hall, you know, you can't even see the company stuff because it's just in, behind these closed doors and stuff, it's like, oh, wow, you know, I figure, I'd figure, yeah, Gravity, for example, I'd figure a small company like that, I'd be like, hey, check out our stuff, come and check out our stuff,

29:41.642 --> 29:48.591
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, whereas you got cocky people like Rockstar M that, you know, they're just like, ah, our stuff is too good for you.

29:49.032 --> 29:52.656
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see it and you'll buy it when it comes out the end, you know.

29:52.856 --> 29:54.619
[SPEAKER_01]: And to be honest, that is the truth.

29:54.679 --> 29:57.462
[SPEAKER_01]: People will buy it because their stuff sells good.

29:57.963 --> 30:00.426
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, you can't really compete with that.

30:00.945 --> 30:13.514
[SPEAKER_02]: And whereas you think they would want people, the everyday other person to see it, like the folks at Kmart that work there or whatever, to see it and create the buzz, they kind of don't have to do that, sadly enough, because the media creates the buzz for them.

30:13.954 --> 30:21.799
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, on a more grassroots level, as far as what we've seen, the buzz for us is all about things that were very easily accessible with very little lines.

30:22.159 --> 30:27.103
[SPEAKER_02]: We Heart Katamari, for example, is one of my favorite things I've seen at the show so far, and a lot of that is because...

30:27.563 --> 30:32.486
[SPEAKER_02]: It was easy to play and I could sit there for a while with it and really look into it and I had a great time with it.

30:33.266 --> 30:36.568
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like stuff like Unreal 2007 or whatever it is.

30:37.468 --> 30:39.369
[SPEAKER_01]: I really don't care about that because you know what?

30:39.930 --> 30:44.132
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to wait in line for an hour to see video that's going to be on the internet the next day.

30:44.707 --> 30:45.388
[SPEAKER_02]: Dan played it.

30:45.428 --> 30:46.769
[SPEAKER_02]: Controls are exactly the same.

30:46.789 --> 30:48.870
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Ocarina, like Wind Waker, they're both the same.

31:14.890 --> 31:21.753
[SPEAKER_03]: But the thing about it though is that he did say that it was pretty cool, but he got to meet Miyamoto.

31:23.654 --> 31:29.197
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so he said that he would have been pissed had he gone and not got to meet Miyamoto.

31:29.597 --> 31:30.917
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was like, whoo, Miyamoto.

31:31.458 --> 31:34.219
[SPEAKER_03]: I get to touch Dan and he got to meet Miyamoto.

31:36.670 --> 31:40.594
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing we saw today that was pretty cool was the Atari Flashback 2.0.

31:40.935 --> 31:43.978
[SPEAKER_01]: It's awesome in its wood graininess.

31:45.019 --> 31:46.120
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't wait to try that.

31:46.601 --> 31:48.783
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not big like the old Atari.

31:48.923 --> 31:49.684
[SPEAKER_02]: It's rather little.

31:49.764 --> 31:55.471
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like about the size of an 8x10 piece of paper, maybe even smaller, but it's wood grain and it's cute.

31:55.531 --> 31:56.712
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so cute and precious.

31:57.358 --> 32:00.179
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone also showed me a brand new Nintendo system that someone made.

32:00.239 --> 32:03.660
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a third-party company created a new system that plays Nintendo games.

32:04.861 --> 32:11.603
[SPEAKER_01]: And their brand new system, I guess, is because I didn't know there was this huge demand for Nintendo systems, but I don't know.

32:12.364 --> 32:15.605
[SPEAKER_01]: So they made them, and they're top-loading, just like the revised version.

32:16.630 --> 32:25.282
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know what has made a striking absence, given all the hype around it, is Namco versus Capcom.

32:25.743 --> 32:27.145
[SPEAKER_03]: Ex-Capcom, however they're doing.

32:27.445 --> 32:29.068
[SPEAKER_03]: Wouldn't that be cross-Capcom then?

32:29.488 --> 32:29.709
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

32:30.467 --> 32:32.788
[SPEAKER_03]: But at any rate, or Namco by Capcom.

32:33.728 --> 32:36.049
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, we went to Capcom to go ask them about it.

32:36.069 --> 32:37.890
[SPEAKER_03]: Capcom was like, go talk to Namco.

32:38.130 --> 32:39.610
[SPEAKER_03]: So we trot over to Namco.

32:40.010 --> 32:43.592
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, no, at first I asked this one guy, I was like, you should ask the info desk here.

32:43.632 --> 32:46.053
[SPEAKER_03]: Have an ad for Final Fight.

32:46.093 --> 32:47.353
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, ooh, another Final Fight sticker.

32:47.473 --> 32:48.153
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we went over.

32:48.954 --> 32:50.274
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I like Final Fight.

32:51.114 --> 32:57.317
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we trotted over there and started talking to this guy at the Namco booth.

32:57.417 --> 32:58.457
[SPEAKER_03]: His name was Matt.

32:59.286 --> 33:00.126
[SPEAKER_03]: He was really cool.

33:00.586 --> 33:03.847
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's like, yeah, well, we don't have any information on it.

33:03.907 --> 33:06.568
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, yeah, Capcom just said, go talk to Namco.

33:06.688 --> 33:07.468
[SPEAKER_03]: So we did.

33:07.548 --> 33:08.969
[SPEAKER_03]: And he was really cool, though.

33:08.989 --> 33:11.990
[SPEAKER_03]: But he's been following it online like the rest of us have.

33:12.070 --> 33:13.690
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're all excited.

33:13.950 --> 33:15.371
[SPEAKER_03]: But they don't have anything official right now.

33:16.091 --> 33:16.431
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

33:16.451 --> 33:18.472
[SPEAKER_02]: You're totally starting like a seventh grade war.

33:18.812 --> 33:22.273
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you're going to one person saying, this person's saying you got it.

33:22.333 --> 33:26.754
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you went to the other one and said, hey, Capcom, Namco's saying to you, I know, I'm teasing you.

33:27.227 --> 33:30.549
[SPEAKER_03]: That is not what I said at all, because I don't do petty shit like that.

33:30.949 --> 33:31.690
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not cool.

33:34.011 --> 33:37.473
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, whenever I was like, we don't know, go talk to them.

33:38.033 --> 33:45.618
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to say, though, in comparison, Namco's people have been a lot friendlier than Capcom's people.

33:46.818 --> 33:49.820
[SPEAKER_03]: I've gone to some booths and just gotten complete and total apathy.

33:50.280 --> 33:52.762
[SPEAKER_03]: You're there to sell a damn product.

33:53.042 --> 33:54.663
[SPEAKER_03]: Freaking act like it, okay?

33:55.023 --> 33:56.504
[SPEAKER_03]: You are there to market yourselves.

33:56.524 --> 33:58.685
[SPEAKER_03]: You're there to make people want to do business with you.

33:58.725 --> 34:00.326
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a fucking trade show.

34:01.466 --> 34:06.108
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Namco, and you know I have lots of love for Namco.

34:07.028 --> 34:13.051
[SPEAKER_03]: They have gone out of their way to make the people visiting their area feel welcome.

34:14.071 --> 34:22.295
[SPEAKER_03]: They've had people running around with little Pac-Man hats on, handing out squishy things, which they actually ran out of when I went to go play the Namco mobile games.

34:23.115 --> 34:24.857
[SPEAKER_03]: But they'll talk to you.

34:25.837 --> 34:27.619
[SPEAKER_03]: And they know what they're talking about.

34:27.679 --> 34:31.902
[SPEAKER_03]: The people are there because they truly enjoy doing what they're doing.

34:32.283 --> 34:36.806
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not there to be a piece of ass in a scrap of leather like the Booth Babes.

34:38.568 --> 34:39.328
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, it's true.

34:39.429 --> 34:45.173
[SPEAKER_03]: They're TNA in a quarter centimeter of leather.

34:46.755 --> 34:47.035
[SPEAKER_03]: You know...

34:47.904 --> 34:50.205
[SPEAKER_03]: But they've really gone out of their way.

34:50.265 --> 34:50.885
[SPEAKER_03]: And Nintendo.

34:51.485 --> 34:53.046
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendo's people have been great.

34:55.267 --> 34:59.808
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to talk to one of their representatives there.

35:00.208 --> 35:02.389
[SPEAKER_03]: And he was just as friendly as he could be.

35:02.989 --> 35:04.670
[SPEAKER_03]: And saying, yeah, you should check this out.

35:04.690 --> 35:05.610
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're doing this.

35:05.730 --> 35:10.372
[SPEAKER_03]: And the guys handing out stuff when I played Nintendo, that guy was funny.

35:10.732 --> 35:13.533
[SPEAKER_03]: And he gave me a bunch of styluses.

35:17.113 --> 35:45.264
[SPEAKER_03]: you know me and my grammar but it was those I have to say were just the nicest people and the Korean guys at Xtango they were like play with us it's fun just in comparison it's amazing the differences between the attitude of people and when you go to the places that make you feel like your business is welcome then that's where I'll get my business

35:45.922 --> 35:49.404
[SPEAKER_02]: I've thrown a good word for Konami, too, because they've always been really good to us, of course.

35:49.484 --> 35:54.046
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's kind of different with them because we actually kind of know a lot of the people at this point that work at the booth.

35:54.106 --> 36:00.029
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, just because, obviously, we started as a music and rhythm game station, so, you know, we've kind of grown ties there.

36:00.970 --> 36:04.891
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I actually didn't mention Konami just for that reason.

36:04.911 --> 36:13.856
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the fact that, you know, that's almost like saying that your cousin's a good worker when you hired, you know,

36:15.393 --> 36:17.037
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't know everyone there.

36:17.077 --> 36:20.466
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I sound like a real pompous ass saying that, but I don't know everyone there.

36:20.506 --> 36:24.215
[SPEAKER_02]: And even the folks I don't know are pretty nice and ask if I have questions and stuff.

36:25.362 --> 36:31.465
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's kind of hard when the people up on the stage of Bad Beat Mania are friends of yours.

36:32.525 --> 36:43.350
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course you expect to be friendly from your friends, but I'm just saying for the other people, the ones we don't know as well, just seeing that difference in attitude, Capcom was just apathy.

36:44.011 --> 36:47.332
[SPEAKER_03]: Playing out, we don't want to be here, we're bored, end the con.

36:48.193 --> 36:51.154
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can't handle that.

36:51.681 --> 36:58.382
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually had kind of a weird experience at Capcom last year, and it's kind of made me not just... I kind of walked by their booth, and I was like, man, is there anything I want to see?

36:58.902 --> 36:59.242
[SPEAKER_02]: Not really.

36:59.322 --> 37:00.483
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, beautiful Joe Coffey.

37:01.423 --> 37:02.103
[SPEAKER_02]: Not worth waiting for.

37:03.423 --> 37:04.743
[SPEAKER_03]: No, the guy there, though, he was cool.

37:05.383 --> 37:06.504
[SPEAKER_03]: I chatted with him a little bit.

37:06.544 --> 37:09.104
[SPEAKER_03]: He stood back so I could take a picture of the machine.

37:09.124 --> 37:10.364
[SPEAKER_03]: That was really awesome.

37:10.784 --> 37:11.805
[SPEAKER_03]: Told me when to come back.

37:12.825 --> 37:13.365
[SPEAKER_03]: He was cool.

37:13.905 --> 37:18.986
[SPEAKER_03]: And the guy by Final Fight, he said what he knew, but the press people, the people at the desk...

37:20.024 --> 37:20.985
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where I had my bad experience.

37:21.005 --> 37:24.127
[SPEAKER_02]: I had this woman laugh in my face last year, one of the people behind the desk.

37:24.287 --> 37:25.127
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally inappropriate.

37:26.068 --> 37:28.830
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but I got a press kit out of him that last year and this year.

37:29.610 --> 37:30.691
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, she can suck it.

37:34.553 --> 37:35.414
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's just...

37:36.874 --> 37:37.555
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

37:54.062 --> 37:58.384
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, so I mean, and this is not something you're going to read about on those big sites.

37:58.404 --> 38:02.467
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not going to tell you the attitudes, the way it really is when you go to E3.

38:02.527 --> 38:04.127
[SPEAKER_02]: People's attitudes at different booths.

38:04.448 --> 38:07.549
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the kind of stuff you're only going to hear here on Orange Lounge Radio.

38:07.649 --> 38:10.451
[SPEAKER_02]: So on that note, I think we're going to wrap it up.

38:10.651 --> 38:13.613
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we've all gotten in what we're going to look at tomorrow, right?

38:14.973 --> 38:17.435
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we going to wrap it up in a scrap of leather like a booth babe?

38:18.399 --> 38:18.939
[SPEAKER_02]: We just might.

38:18.959 --> 38:22.681
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I tried to find age text booths so I could find the anti-booth babes today.

38:23.041 --> 38:27.663
[SPEAKER_02]: I could only find their little room, and the woman working in the room was an attractive gal.

38:27.743 --> 38:32.945
[SPEAKER_02]: She wasn't a booth babe gal, you know, your stereotypical blonde hair, blue eye, big titty booth babe.

38:33.285 --> 38:35.766
[SPEAKER_02]: But she was an attractive female, you know.

38:36.246 --> 38:41.949
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have to figure out where this anti-booth babe, granny panty campaign is going on.

38:42.765 --> 38:45.387
[SPEAKER_01]: And would you really want to be one of those women?

38:45.647 --> 38:48.489
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, you're the ugly person that gets to promote our game.

38:48.929 --> 38:49.590
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.

38:50.790 --> 38:55.013
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, we kind of talked about that last Sunday, but... I did.

38:55.033 --> 38:57.095
[SPEAKER_03]: I was sad I didn't get a chance to get his picture.

38:57.495 --> 39:01.257
[SPEAKER_03]: They had people doing KOF, like, cosplay, you know, there as part of their thing.

39:01.718 --> 39:05.400
[SPEAKER_03]: And I walked right past someone who was K, and he was hot.

39:05.840 --> 39:10.844
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like... And he went outside to have a smoke.

39:12.139 --> 39:15.382
[SPEAKER_02]: So there you have it, your first booth stud report.

39:15.422 --> 39:15.942
[SPEAKER_02]: So there you go.

39:16.383 --> 39:17.864
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, final thoughts, everybody.

39:17.904 --> 39:18.164
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki.

39:21.547 --> 39:22.328
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's see.

39:22.948 --> 39:30.575
[SPEAKER_01]: My final thought is I got to see a talking donkey, and I took my picture with Mario, even though I didn't want to.

39:32.076 --> 39:38.322
[SPEAKER_01]: And tomorrow, I'm just looking forward to kind of going home because I'm tired.

39:40.666 --> 39:45.889
[SPEAKER_02]: And my final thought is thank you 1up.com for the mango smoothie that I didn't have to pay $5 for.

39:48.670 --> 39:57.855
[SPEAKER_03]: Mine is I really, really, really, really, really, really love the Katamari and reject false icons.

39:59.352 --> 40:02.274
