00:24.920 --> 00:29.640
My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Skye. Joining me as always, my lovely co-host in this corner,

00:29.640 --> 00:34.360
dark Sakura Jamie summers you call me lovely but donkey said I was gorgeous

00:34.360 --> 00:43.560
and also the one and only Loki I am here alright so we're having a little bit of

00:43.560 --> 00:47.920
technical difficulties I'll tell you what so obviously Wednesday's podcast

00:47.920 --> 00:51.520
actually didn't end up going up until Thursday morning so we apologize for

00:51.520 --> 00:55.120
that delay but we just had all these ideas on how we were gonna upload the

00:55.120 --> 01:00.220
show and none of them worked first off go figure neither of the hotels were

01:00.220 --> 01:03.060
staying at happen because we're actually across two separate hotels the three of

01:03.060 --> 01:08.300
us neither of them have Wi-Fi access so that does us no good there and then the

01:08.300 --> 01:13.180
internet cafe that is up the street from where Loki and I are staying was closed

01:13.180 --> 01:16.260
yesterday and we were thinking oh we'll just upload it over there no they're

01:16.260 --> 01:19.980
closed so we had to wait and today we uploaded it from the e3 Business Center

01:19.980 --> 01:22.840
so we finally got it up there so you guys actually won't hear this until

01:22.840 --> 01:27.480
Friday morning so we apologize for that delay but you know it happens and we're

01:27.480 --> 01:32.680
still bringing you the coverage faster than the 99.9% of the other sites out

01:32.680 --> 01:35.080
there on the internet so we're really excited about that we also want to give

01:35.080 --> 01:39.240
a big thank you to Jason our webmaster who has is helping us out on the other

01:39.240 --> 01:44.400
end and getting these podcasts to you guys yeah all right so let's talk about

01:44.400 --> 01:48.640
Thursday how you guys feeling after today two-thirds of the showdown only

01:48.640 --> 01:54.540
Friday to go today is the longest day of e3 as well going from nine o'clock in the morning to six o'clock in the evening

01:54.540 --> 01:57.780
I know Loki and I were there all day. Jamie G there nine o'clock to

01:58.480 --> 02:01.640
Got there around ten something actually because we went to breakfast

02:03.280 --> 02:05.480
Not us we we kind of skip breakfast

02:05.480 --> 02:09.480
Well, we actually ended up eating like pizza what at about 1130 or so?

02:09.480 --> 02:11.940
No, no even before that was Mike 1030 or something

02:11.940 --> 02:16.240
It was about 1030 and the reason behind that is is if you don't eat at e3

02:16.240 --> 02:20.720
3 super early in the day or super late in the day you will be waiting in line

02:20.720 --> 02:27.640
for a long time as lanky style from the other show and I found out on yes on

02:27.640 --> 02:32.680
Wednesday we waited in line for like 45 minutes to get an $8 hamburger and fries

02:32.680 --> 02:37.620
which is like even worse quality than you'd get at Burger King so that's one

02:37.620 --> 02:41.760
thing if you guys planning on going to e3 in the future eat early eat late or

02:41.760 --> 02:46.680
sneak your food in I don't know you know what I actually ate a hamburger too just

02:46.680 --> 02:51.280
without the bun and she gave me two patties I had a cheeseburger and it was

02:51.280 --> 02:56.880
still eight bucks all right yeah I got twice as much food as you did also I

02:56.880 --> 02:59.960
want to just say to you guys real quick we are having another technical

02:59.960 --> 03:02.760
difficulty tonight we actually only have one microphone so if you ever couple

03:02.760 --> 03:06.480
clanks and weird volume things it's just because we're passing it back and forth

03:06.480 --> 03:10.760
but again we want to bring you guys the up to new up to the minute news so we're

03:10.760 --> 03:15.300
just kind of making do with it anyway Loki also remember it if you're coming

03:15.300 --> 03:19.460
to e3 to buy food bring cash because I don't know why but like after about a

03:19.460 --> 03:23.460
couple hours after they open there's like you know we don't want to you know

03:23.460 --> 03:29.940
have to worry about you know doing our you know credit cards and whatnot so

03:29.940 --> 03:33.980
you know to hell with it and you're screwed because you have your food and

03:33.980 --> 03:39.500
you're like oh can I pay the credit no ah crap then then you're stuck in the

03:39.500 --> 03:45.700
awkward moment luckily I always bring cash so just one of the fun thing and

03:45.700 --> 03:49.420
you know so I okay one other thing I gotta say about all that is you notice

03:49.420 --> 03:54.060
that around the LA Convention Center there is no fast food whatsoever no

03:54.060 --> 03:57.980
McDonald's no burger within a reasonable walking distance nothing you think they

03:57.980 --> 04:00.740
do that on purpose so that you're kind of forced to eat those I heard they

04:00.740 --> 04:04.640
chased away a hot dog vendor today too that wasn't licensed they fear

04:04.640 --> 04:12.400
competition is so that you buy their overpriced crappy but food alright

04:12.400 --> 04:15.480
enough talk about food I'm sorry guys let's move on to the games the games

04:15.480 --> 04:19.360
what we really want to talk about let's do the what we did yesterday let's talk

04:19.360 --> 04:23.520
about three interesting games that we saw today at e3 three things we played

04:23.520 --> 04:27.840
and enjoy let's go around and start with Loki three games actually no wait you

04:27.840 --> 04:31.920
stole mine yesterday I'm starting off today three three games I played today

04:31.920 --> 04:36.240
that I enjoyed. First off, Castlevania DS I actually checked out today and I thought

04:36.240 --> 04:40.800
it was pretty cool. I like the way that you can kind of draw to defeat the boss.

04:40.800 --> 04:45.840
It was kind of interesting. A lot of DS games to date, they've relied solely on

04:45.840 --> 04:50.520
the touch, I think, the touch element of the game. Whereas Castlevania DS, it was a

04:50.520 --> 04:54.280
Castlevania game like you'd see on the Game Boy Advance with your map or

04:54.280 --> 04:59.240
sub-screen shown at the top, but the drawing only came into it once in a

04:59.240 --> 05:05.680
while, which I thought was very cool. So, Castlevania DS I liked for that. What else

05:05.680 --> 05:12.560
did I play today that I liked? I also played, over at Nintendo, I managed to play

05:12.560 --> 05:16.560
Donkey Konga 2, which was interesting, it was different, but some of the songs in it

05:16.560 --> 05:21.120
were really weird. Like, the song I played was Headstrong, and I don't even remember who sings that,

05:21.120 --> 05:27.440
because I don't listen to mainstream music, but, um, Headstrong, eh, whatever. So it was weird to hear that in

05:27.440 --> 05:33.800
Donkey Konga though of all things and then I'm trying to think what else oh

05:33.800 --> 05:37.600
yes one pleasant surprise the first thing I saw this morning over at

05:37.600 --> 05:41.640
Midway's booth I played Mortal Kombat Shaolin Monks which I wasn't sure what

05:41.640 --> 05:43.960
to expect from that I thought it was just gonna be another Mortal Kombat game

05:43.960 --> 05:48.440
but it's more like Mortal Kombat in the I don't know if this is a fair comparison

05:48.440 --> 05:52.240
but in the Devil May Cry sense where you're walking around and you're just

05:52.240 --> 05:56.800
like beating things up but it's kind of cool because if you pick up a weapon

05:56.800 --> 06:01.160
like in more total Mortal Kombat style you're lobbing off heads and arms and

06:01.160 --> 06:04.000
all that fun stuff and you get to do fatalities. I was actually really

06:04.000 --> 06:06.720
pleasantly surprised with Mortal Kombat Salamence it's actually one of those

06:06.720 --> 06:09.440
few games I see that I'm like you know I'm gonna have to buy this when it comes

06:09.440 --> 06:14.520
out but of course I've always been kind of a Mortal Kombat fan I guess so

06:14.520 --> 06:19.880
I say so those are my three. Logie? It was Mortal Kombat of War that's what it was

06:19.880 --> 06:24.080
because everyone's got to do the God of War Devil May Cry game even Disney but

06:24.080 --> 06:26.080
I haven't played that one yet.

06:26.080 --> 06:30.680
Is that That's So Raven 2, where Raven Simones just starts coming out and kicking the crap

06:30.680 --> 06:31.680
out of everybody?

06:31.680 --> 06:32.680
You wish.

06:32.680 --> 06:39.120
No, that would be the Nightmare Before Christmas game that's, you know, based on- Raven Simones

06:39.120 --> 06:40.400
and Nightmare Before Christmas?

06:40.400 --> 06:43.600
No, Raven Simones should not be in any game.

06:43.600 --> 06:44.600
Ever.

06:44.600 --> 06:45.600
I don't know.

06:45.600 --> 06:47.400
They really set crap for the Game Boy Advance.

06:47.400 --> 06:49.400
Another reason why I'm not buying the Game Boy Micro.

06:49.400 --> 06:53.000
Okay, I don't need crap in smaller sizes.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
Still crap.

06:54.000 --> 06:59.360
I played a couple games today. I played LA rush which is

06:59.920 --> 07:05.280
Just like San Francisco rush except you have no clue where the hell you're supposed to be going. It was very unclear

07:05.280 --> 07:07.280
It's just like driving in LA for reals

07:07.600 --> 07:10.200
It was unclear where the hell you're supposed to be going

07:10.200 --> 07:13.780
You actually had to look at your map and look at you know

07:13.780 --> 07:20.960
These checkpoints that they had that resembled something from either say Grand Theft Auto during your your checkpoint race missions or whatever or?

07:20.960 --> 07:23.960
or Midnight Club, the original Midnight Club,

07:23.960 --> 07:26.240
where you have this beam of light coming,

07:26.240 --> 07:28.240
and so you see it off in the distance,

07:28.240 --> 07:30.240
but you're like, how the hell do I get there?

07:30.240 --> 07:32.060
And a lot of times I got lost.

07:32.060 --> 07:34.300
It was just not fun in that sense.

07:34.300 --> 07:35.720
And the other annoying thing is every time

07:35.720 --> 07:37.080
you get in a high-speed car crash,

07:37.080 --> 07:39.560
they do slow-mo instant replay.

07:39.560 --> 07:41.160
Annoying as hell.

07:41.160 --> 07:43.400
Yeah, sure, ooh, it looks cool, but guess what?

07:43.400 --> 07:46.000
You're not burnout, so stop trying to be like burnout.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.900
Okay, you're L.A. Rush.

07:47.900 --> 07:54.540
San Francisco rush you know unrealistic you know loops and stuff that is what I expect from LA rush. That's not what I got

07:55.380 --> 07:59.620
It's just trying to be burnout, and I don't like that. It's really bad anyways

08:00.540 --> 08:05.700
The other thing I played was shadow the Hedgehog and that was okay

08:05.700 --> 08:10.820
That's all it was it was just Sonic with a gun, and that's it's really. I was just like okay

08:11.540 --> 08:14.520
Whatever not really impressed at all

08:14.520 --> 08:17.480
So, big deal for that.

08:17.480 --> 08:21.840
And then, kind of touched back to something I talked about yesterday, I played Dance Dance

08:21.840 --> 08:29.500
Revolution Xtreme 2, but with the IToy support today, and I was, once again, not very impressed

08:29.500 --> 08:30.760
by the hands and feet mode.

08:30.760 --> 08:32.200
I thought it was retarded.

08:32.200 --> 08:37.280
No, no, no, no, you're just pissed off because you failed your song, and you're also pissed

08:37.280 --> 08:40.480
off that when I played In the Heat of the Night, expert into hands and feet mode, that

08:40.480 --> 08:41.480
I got a crowd.

08:41.480 --> 08:43.880
So, you know, don't go there.

08:43.880 --> 08:48.780
First off, hands and feet mode, all they do is throw up some random hand, um, wave things

08:48.780 --> 08:50.700
or whatever, and that's it.

08:50.700 --> 08:51.980
It kinda sucked.

08:51.980 --> 08:58.940
But really, um, any other game, well there's another game I played today that, um, we'll

08:58.940 --> 09:04.100
go into later just because, you know, well, it's just a different story.

09:04.100 --> 09:05.140
But yeah, that's pretty much it.

09:05.140 --> 09:08.140
Those are the three games I played.

09:08.140 --> 09:12.380
Dark Sakura, your big three from today, Thursday.

09:12.380 --> 09:19.380
My big three. Well, I'm not, you know, I looked at a whole bunch of stuff. I played a few.

09:19.380 --> 09:27.380
Um, I have to completely just gush over Kingdom Hearts 2. Oh, it was Kingdom Hearts 2. It

09:27.380 --> 09:30.980
was so cool. Noah, are you gushing because it's Kingdom

09:30.980 --> 09:36.160
Hearts or are you gushing like everybody made this giant gush sound in the Squeenix show

09:36.160 --> 09:40.480
when you saw that Johnny Depp is, uh, what was his character in Pirates of the Caribbean?

09:40.480 --> 09:43.720
I didn't see the movie I have to be honest I I don't get out much yeah thank

09:43.720 --> 09:46.680

09:46.680 --> 09:50.880

someday I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm making pouty face I was gonna find out tomorrow

10:51.080 --> 10:58.480
you give me a dollar anyway anyway Kingdom Hearts 2 is pretty and it's very

10:58.480 --> 11:03.160
I mean, it's really it the graph this has retains the same graphic style

11:03.160 --> 11:08.080
I mean, it's pretty much on with the last one except you can tell it does more in subtle ways

11:09.040 --> 11:14.400
First of all, I have to mention this. This is what made me really bouncy went over to a squenix

11:14.980 --> 11:19.800
No pictures. No pictures. No, we're gonna hide the game from the world

11:20.480 --> 11:24.360
And I haven't seen a single other booth say you can't take pictures

11:24.360 --> 11:34.480
um PlayStation did the same thing well f them both yeah anyway I tried over to

11:34.480 --> 11:38.760
Buena Vista today eyes look around no one's there so I start playing and

11:38.760 --> 11:44.120
picture guys like I'll play for you while you take pictures and I'll show

11:44.120 --> 11:49.080
you the cool shit you can take pictures of them and I wanted to actually get his

11:49.080 --> 11:52.400
name and he's like no I don't actually work for Buena Vista I'm more of a

11:52.400 --> 11:56.040
correspondence so I said I'll credit you as that nice guy at the Buena Vista

11:56.040 --> 12:04.560
booth so thank you nice guy anyway he showed me you can actually fuse with

12:04.560 --> 12:07.520
other characters in your party and actually it's really cool when you fuse

12:07.520 --> 12:17.760
with goofy because you get the valor okay bitch you get you get the valor and

12:17.760 --> 12:24.080
he wears this red outfit and he wields two key blades and that was

12:24.080 --> 12:29.240
pretty cool and he's got all this power and he did the the Mulan level he did

12:29.240 --> 12:32.320
the level where Hades is trying to kick your ass but the Mulan level is cool

12:32.320 --> 12:37.360
because you know the scene where who is the bad guy in Mulan I don't remember

12:37.360 --> 12:41.000
his name but you know he comes over the hill and there's a few of his army there

12:41.000 --> 12:44.640
and they're like okay and they rush and then a bajillion of them rush over the

12:44.640 --> 12:50.120
hill well instead it was a bunch of heart of the heartless and we're talking

12:50.120 --> 12:57.760
like there were easily several hundred on the screen at that time attacking you

12:57.760 --> 13:01.580
and you just have to outlast the clock at this point but there and I've got

13:01.580 --> 13:07.360
several pictures of it they're gonna be online when we get back unless somebody

13:07.360 --> 13:11.800
is kind enough to take them back beforehand but there was just so many on

13:11.800 --> 13:17.520
screen I was really impressed I mean hi we are all over the place we are yellow

13:17.520 --> 13:21.840
and ugly in which I kick your ass that's everything so that was really cool and

13:21.840 --> 13:26.360
then I got to get into one of the media events I got because I went over there

13:26.360 --> 13:31.200
because I talked about call Cthulhu the other night when we did our last actual

13:31.200 --> 13:36.120
podcast so I had I found out where Bethesda was and I was like you know I

13:36.120 --> 13:38.720
like I've been looking at this call Cthulhu thing and it looks pretty

13:38.720 --> 13:43.440
groovy it's like well okay come on in and so I sat there with the other press

13:43.440 --> 13:50.660
people and the guy was playing through it and I was like oh cool but the best

13:50.660 --> 13:56.000
thing about it you know visually it's you know it's about 80% done and

13:56.000 --> 14:00.640
actually I got some more stats on it but it has it's gonna be I do believe he

14:00.640 --> 14:05.660
said out in either August or September you have an insanity meter the basically

14:05.660 --> 14:09.800
the main character was a policeman who went insane and then he got out of the

14:09.800 --> 14:15.880
asylum and became a detective well you when you see shocking images like in one

14:15.880 --> 14:22.800
scene there was a like a ghoul pinned to a cross in this church or when you're

14:22.800 --> 14:27.920
being chased or other things your insanity level goes up and your screen

14:27.920 --> 14:32.800
starts getting wavy start getting tunnel vision and then you hallucinate like

14:32.800 --> 14:37.720
There's one scene where he's running down a tunnel all of a sudden. He's running through the halls of the asylum

14:37.720 --> 14:42.720
He was trapped in or when you enter a new scene if your insanity level is high enough

14:43.280 --> 14:47.780
Then you get flashes of where all the enemies in the area are

14:48.040 --> 14:52.320
You and he says there's two ways of doing each level you can do it the right way the sneaky way with it

14:52.500 --> 14:54.500
you know takes a little bit longer or

14:55.080 --> 15:01.220
You can just rush through everything guns blazing actually said that the sneaky way actually tends to be a little bit shorter

15:01.220 --> 15:05.260
but I'll have more information now I'm gonna do a write-up on it you can all

15:05.260 --> 15:10.700
see it on orange lounge radio.com plug plug and hear me gush about it on a

15:10.700 --> 15:15.380
pump up the volume later on so Kingdom hearts to call go through Louie got one

15:15.380 --> 15:36.800
the next topic is I know we want to talk

15:36.800 --> 15:41.260
next about oh wait you thought another one I still have to go back and say that

15:41.260 --> 15:46.960
uh that shadow the hedgehog was pretty groovy looking oh no I know what it was

15:46.960 --> 15:52.220
my other game gun star superheroes because it's just gun star heroes and

15:52.220 --> 15:57.040
that's all all right well Jamie spoiled a little bit of our next segment the

15:57.040 --> 16:05.120
most inch spoiler oh my omg spoiler spoiler my ass okay so what I want to

16:05.120 --> 16:11.760
Talk about now is the most interesting moment of your e3 day, so I'll start with Loki since this got spoiled OMG. I

16:12.740 --> 16:19.160
Was gonna talk about that. Oh well anyways um yeah, so I went to this one booth that they had there

16:19.160 --> 16:23.360
It was right next to X tango. Which is the game we talked about last year. It was pretty cool

16:23.360 --> 16:25.960
So it's tango music game sort of like bust to move

16:26.600 --> 16:28.520
anyways and

16:28.520 --> 16:31.460
Now there's this like cyber sex game called

16:31.460 --> 16:41.120
uh oh man feel free and anyways so basically the game I don't really know

16:41.120 --> 16:47.640
what the premise was cuz I only got to see it for like a very brief time and so

16:47.640 --> 16:52.940
um basically you had is sort of remind me the sims but you had different things

16:52.940 --> 16:56.120
that you're kind of like controlling the girl you were talking to or something

16:56.120 --> 17:00.080
and so you kid like you know the guy would start dancing and you click D or

17:00.080 --> 17:03.100
whatever to make her dance and then you could do different like

17:04.040 --> 17:10.360
Provocative dance stuff and then and then he's like, oh, he's all like because it's like this Asian guy that spoke no English

17:10.360 --> 17:16.300
He's all he's all there real brief English and he's like he's a pick here. See it takes her top off

17:16.300 --> 17:20.320
Okay, so I clicked I clicked here took her top off on my oh, that's kind of cool

17:20.600 --> 17:22.400
So he's just let me play around with it

17:22.400 --> 17:27.800
So I click their shorts or her miniskirt and then I came up and then all hell broke loose

17:27.800 --> 17:33.380
was like, no no no no no no no no no. That's illegal. No, no no. And so they had, like,

17:33.380 --> 17:37.040
someone come over to translate, and she's like, no, you can't do that cuz it's illegal

17:37.040 --> 17:42.720
or something like that. I'm like, okay. One other thing I thought was interesting about

17:42.720 --> 17:46.480
that game, and I, I don't remember the name of it, does anybody recall, it's on my camera

17:46.480 --> 17:49.820
somewhere, we'll post more information on the site. Feel 3 I think was the name of it.

17:49.820 --> 17:53.040
Was it Cyber Entertainment was the name of the booth I think? It's, anyway, it's important.

17:53.040 --> 17:56.040
it's it was important but this is everything so not only is it like a

17:56.040 --> 18:02.240
cyber sex him it has webcam windows in the upper left and upper right so you

18:02.240 --> 18:08.720
can go virtual and you can go like really virtual like really interactive

18:08.720 --> 18:11.760
it's it's kind of scary because there's people that are really gonna benefit

18:11.760 --> 18:16.100
from this game and that's makes me sad a bit I'm thinking one person controls a

18:16.100 --> 18:19.520
guy the other one controls the girl that's what it seems like you do

18:19.520 --> 18:22.940
understand when this game comes out they're both gonna be controlled by God

18:22.940 --> 18:27.920
whether you know it or not you can tell there's the camera that's why they have

18:27.920 --> 18:33.860
it it's the dude camera nothing a wig and a little makeup can't hide nothing

18:33.860 --> 18:38.680
they're holding a photo up in front of your webcam yeah I'll just loop this

18:38.680 --> 18:44.880
Jenna Jameson footage I taped off the TV a little while ago all I know is it's

18:44.880 --> 18:49.720
just weird and they had this weird like audio box thing there I don't know if

18:49.720 --> 18:54.480
that was part of it or what but God knows what it was because it's supposed

18:54.480 --> 18:57.880
to be totally interactive and I don't know what they how far they're talking

18:57.880 --> 19:02.000
totally interactive who knows anyways yeah that was that was the weird thing

19:02.000 --> 19:06.080
that happened today one of the weird things the cyber sex game had a weird

19:06.080 --> 19:12.600
box moving on dark soccer the most interesting thing you saw today or

19:12.600 --> 19:22.080
interesting experience I got to play with the Katamari today and I got to put

19:22.080 --> 19:26.240
our media sampler on the Katamari and then you've got to put the reject false

19:26.240 --> 19:30.920
icon sticker on there for me made me feel like a happy fan it was the

19:30.920 --> 19:34.760
Katamari and then I got to climb all over stuff and actually get into media

19:34.760 --> 19:40.760
stuff without actually being media passes that was pretty cool and you know

19:40.760 --> 19:45.580
Um when I put your sticker on the Katamari I they actually gave me a Katamari to mashi to mousepad

19:45.580 --> 19:49.240
Well, they gave me another one because I went back to play the game with Mila Tava

19:49.240 --> 19:51.160
I went back to play it again later. They gave me a second one

19:51.160 --> 19:56.160
So I'm thinking about maybe doing a little giveaway in the near future for one of our lucky fans. We'll see

19:57.240 --> 20:03.400
Actually, no that I remember there's actually something else that I was gonna say was my most interesting moment. That was my massage

20:03.400 --> 20:09.800
because my I went out well I got the free one the Tylenol ouch booth thing

20:09.800 --> 20:13.260
and that was all cool and the guy worked on my hip you know cuz I was in that car

20:13.260 --> 20:17.360
accident and I was really in pain but I went back after this is about an hour

20:17.360 --> 20:23.080
after my bike getting kicked in haha but I went back and paid for a like a 25

20:23.080 --> 20:32.560
minute full massage and my masseur was a was an actual stand-up comedian so when

20:32.560 --> 20:36.040
When he was giving me my foot rub, he was making me laugh.

20:36.040 --> 20:40.160
Welcome to L.A., everybody.

20:40.160 --> 20:48.560
But I like what he said, that making somebody laugh is a serious business, you know.

20:48.560 --> 20:54.680
And we got to talking about how... yeah.

20:54.680 --> 20:59.640
But we got to a discussion on how, you know, if you live your life all stressed out, and

20:59.640 --> 21:04.080
don't laugh you don't do anything for yourself you're gonna die okay you're

21:04.080 --> 21:10.780
just going to get cancer of the lower intestine and die not able to shit on

21:10.780 --> 21:17.360
your own what a pleasant image to paint for all these people who are tuning in

21:17.360 --> 21:25.480
to hear the latest game news thank you it was an example of but you know we

21:25.480 --> 21:30.480
were talking about you know those of us who take time to enjoy our lives you

21:30.480 --> 21:35.880
know take time to laugh take time to play games you know stress relief you

21:35.880 --> 21:39.760
know have some leisurely time those are the people who are generally gonna have

21:39.760 --> 21:43.080
a happier outlook and who are gonna live longer lives at least unless the car hits

21:43.080 --> 21:47.880
them oh boy all right so lesson learned today you know that kind of goes along

21:47.880 --> 21:51.560
with your advice column you know that we do usually on our typical podcast we do

21:51.560 --> 21:55.200
weekly you know because if we you know sat in the house and played video games

21:55.200 --> 21:58.440
games all day, we'd have no time to go out and go to Hooters while we're in LA.

21:58.440 --> 22:03.520
So remember, point and laugh. It'll add five years to your life.

22:03.520 --> 22:08.720
Alright, my most interesting moment today. I actually went and stood in line to get

22:08.720 --> 22:13.640
autographs from the folks that do Attack of the Show over on G4. Now typically I'm

22:13.640 --> 22:17.480
not one of those, you know, starstruck people because, you know, everybody's just

22:17.480 --> 22:21.280
people. It's just another job. Just like, you know, I have a day job. That's their

22:21.280 --> 22:25.000
day job. They're just, they just got a day job that in some ways is a little more

22:25.000 --> 22:28.480
fun but can also be a lot of work I've been on that side of it studying

22:28.480 --> 22:32.320
colleges I know it's a lot of work but my dad really really likes it because

22:32.320 --> 22:35.800
he's been following the screen savers ever since it was Leo Lepore and then it

22:35.800 --> 22:39.220
transitioned and transitioned he's moved along with it now it's this attack of

22:39.220 --> 22:43.680
the show so I was like okay my dad's really excited for me to be here a

22:43.680 --> 22:47.180
moment so I'm gonna go get him an autograph so I went and I got him an

22:47.180 --> 22:50.480
autograph and I told Sarah Lane while I had a mo because they were nice and they

22:50.480 --> 22:53.160
you know chatted up with us a little bit while we were each kind of waiting for

22:53.160 --> 22:57.600
autograph and Sarah Lane asked me and say you know how are you and I so fine

22:57.600 --> 23:01.800
you know I'm I'm getting this for my dad if you can make it out to him and he has

23:01.800 --> 23:06.360
a little bit of a crush on you which you know is kind of nice and and she goes oh

23:06.360 --> 23:11.880
uh-huh well thank you Alan wink wink cuz that's Alan's my dad's name and I'm like

23:11.880 --> 23:16.280
I would have been all like dude I swear it's not me I'm gay but I don't want to

23:16.280 --> 23:19.360
make an awkward moment you know I might been an awkward moment hi guys if you're

23:19.360 --> 23:25.720
listening cuz cuz Matt ended up slipping something hello your name tag doesn't

23:25.720 --> 23:33.480
say Alan I mean hi Alan yeah Alan's my stage name I think she was just trying

23:33.480 --> 23:38.480
to be cute so I totally respect her for that but yeah it was kind of it was kind

23:38.480 --> 23:42.600
of one of those things was like you know I could tell the truth here but I don't

23:42.600 --> 23:46.120
want to make an awkward moment I'll just take it as a you know oh she's being

23:46.120 --> 23:51.060
She's nice. They were very nice to kind of chat it up with all this because I've you know also seen those

23:51.060 --> 23:55.600
You know autograph signings where they're like sign next sign next so that was cool of them

23:55.600 --> 24:01.740
And actually I thought g4s booth all things considered because they've taken a lot of heat ever since the tech TV

24:01.740 --> 24:07.560
I thought they actually had kind of an interesting booth where you could kind of play the actual Nintendo and everything and then Matt

24:07.620 --> 24:11.340
Ended up seizing this opportunity. What did you do Matt while we were in line for that?

24:11.340 --> 24:17.000
Well, I was, you were talking to her about, you know, what Warner's Lounge Radio was,

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
so I figured I'd just help Claire.

24:19.000 --> 24:20.000
I did ask!

24:20.000 --> 24:26.240
I mean, so, um, while I was having, um, Kevin, uh, Pura, and, uh, Sarah Lane to have, signing,

24:26.240 --> 24:31.360
um, the picture that they gave me here, um, I gave them one of our media samplers for

24:31.360 --> 24:37.060
a podcast, so, you know, hello, Kevin and Sarah, or, Kevin and Sarah's interns, whoever

24:37.060 --> 24:41.200
it may be that, that might possibly listen to the show, hello.

24:41.200 --> 24:45.220
Kevin and Sarah's trash can for all we know I mean who knows yes the bum rum

24:45.220 --> 24:48.880
machine outside the trash picking up you know CD thinking it's something valuable

24:48.880 --> 24:53.120
now anyways no no they're really cool and the booth is pretty cool you know

24:53.120 --> 25:00.120
I've in the past you know given g4 a little bit of you know criticism but hey

25:00.120 --> 25:04.440
really I figured out who the real real villain of this you know everything is

25:04.440 --> 25:08.980
it's all Comcast because because for you know it's all their fault that my cable

25:08.980 --> 25:13.540
never works let's face it kids we haven't said anything everyone else on

25:13.540 --> 25:18.740
the internet hasn't already said sorry that's just you know anyway oh and we

25:18.740 --> 25:21.820
have film for some TV thing too but I don't I don't know I don't remember what

25:21.820 --> 25:29.100
it was we were filmed as bumpers for what was it g4tv.com so if you find a

25:29.100 --> 25:35.020
rerun or happen to see g4tv.com their e3 coverage you will see us as a

25:35.020 --> 25:40.560
commercial intro you know or whatever so you'll see no us like yelling screaming

25:40.560 --> 25:47.020
because that's what we were told to do and also we got to play with the eight

25:47.020 --> 25:51.820
foot Nintendo controller that they built which is cool and I am dedicated now to

25:51.820 --> 25:58.140
build one that's larger just because I have to another one of those projects

25:58.140 --> 26:04.320
you'll never finish all right all right so tomorrow is the last day of e3 what

26:04.320 --> 26:08.320
What are your guys' plans? Something you definitely have to check out tomorrow at E3 with the last day.

26:08.320 --> 26:11.320
Sitting in the Sony line for three hours.

26:11.320 --> 26:16.320
What is up with the lines at E3? I know we kind of talked about this a little bit yesterday.

26:16.320 --> 26:20.320
But I haven't bitched about it enough. Every booth has some type of line.

26:20.320 --> 26:22.320
It's like, Midway had a line if you want to see Unreal.

26:22.320 --> 26:26.320
Sega has a line if you want to see whatever. I don't know because I didn't sit in a line.

26:26.320 --> 26:30.320
Quake 4 has a line. Nintendo has a three hour line.

26:30.320 --> 26:34.380
realize you know a lot of folks are like boy e3 is so glamorous you get to play

26:34.380 --> 26:37.440
all the latest and greatest games and don't get me wrong it's pretty cool we're

26:37.440 --> 26:40.940
very lucky to be able to go to e3 and we're having a good time overall but to

26:40.940 --> 26:44.140
play the really good stuff you guys it's like going to Disneyland if you want to

26:44.140 --> 26:48.460
ride the nice ride you got to sit in line for three hours and you know for

26:48.460 --> 26:54.340
that five-minute thrill it's kind of you know too bad well I'm still gonna be

26:54.340 --> 27:02.620
getting up at 7 and trying to be over there by well they start at 9 try to be

27:02.620 --> 27:07.780
over there by like a quarter till uh thing you're most looking forward to

27:07.780 --> 27:14.540
doing tomorrow Loki going home to be honest I mean honestly I'm done the show

27:14.540 --> 27:19.420
right now that I thought the whole line it Nintendo's booth was to see the

27:19.420 --> 27:22.740
revolution then when I found out just to play the stupid Zelda game I was like oh

27:22.740 --> 27:25.020
Ah, the hell with that! I'm not staying there.

27:25.020 --> 27:27.780
I'll go see Sony, because at least they're gonna show the PS3.

27:27.780 --> 27:31.740
Nintendo, oh wow, you show us your ugly system, but nothing that does.

27:31.740 --> 27:34.780
You hype it up and you don't come through and say, you say,

27:34.780 --> 27:38.260
here's our little, little Game Boy Advance, come play it!

27:38.260 --> 27:40.700
I'm like, ugh, awful!

27:40.700 --> 27:45.820
You know, honestly, let's make it a little bit smaller and charge some more for it.

27:45.820 --> 27:47.580
That'd be, that'd be better.

27:47.580 --> 27:49.660
I have to kind of retract something I said yesterday.

27:49.660 --> 27:53.020
I actually got the DS download thing in Nintendo to work better for me today

27:53.020 --> 27:57.140
And I still have medios on my DS because I put it in sleep mode. So that's kind of cool

27:57.140 --> 27:59.340
So I feel a little better about the DS download thing now

28:00.020 --> 28:02.860
And I'm gonna have to go back then and get a electroplankton

28:04.020 --> 28:05.820
electroplankton

28:05.820 --> 28:10.740
Honestly, no one make you three a lot better. It didn't make it harder to get into because

28:11.380 --> 28:15.420
Everybody's just coming in no matter what. I mean you're some people that are like

28:15.420 --> 28:22.020
sort of in the industry, you know, those are the people that are coming in. And granted,

28:22.020 --> 28:26.540
we are sort of in the industry but there's some people that really are like,

28:26.540 --> 28:32.540
I work for Kmart, Kmart sells video games, therefore I get in. When in fact they

28:32.540 --> 28:35.740
work in the lawn and garden department. But I mean, and if you think I'm making

28:35.740 --> 28:39.640
this shit up, I'm not. Like there's actually people there who are doing that.

28:39.640 --> 28:42.340
They work in the lawn and garden department at Kmart but because Kmart

28:42.340 --> 28:45.840
sells video games they get in and it's kind of like okay dude you need to draw

28:45.840 --> 28:50.100
the line somewhere maybe rethink you know because again as you said you know

28:50.100 --> 28:53.820
we're kind of on the bubble and other podcasters at least we haven't run into

28:53.820 --> 28:57.780
anybody there you know they probably think they can't even get in that's the

28:57.780 --> 29:01.380
thing see that's why you have no companies like rock star and so I have

29:01.380 --> 29:03.420
all the stuff behind closed doors because they don't want the average

29:03.420 --> 29:07.460
person seeing stuff they want people that are covering the press and stuff to

29:07.460 --> 29:10.620
see it so it's just like they're creating like another level that you

29:10.620 --> 29:17.080
have to get to in order to actually see the entire show, which is dumb. I don't even understand

29:17.080 --> 29:25.180
some of these smaller companies. For example, who's the company that does... Not Crave,

29:25.180 --> 29:31.140
but just some of the stuff in Kentia Hall. You can't even see the company's stuff because

29:31.140 --> 29:36.700
it's just behind these closed doors and stuff. It's like, oh, wow. I'd figure... Yeah, Gravity,

29:36.700 --> 29:40.200
for example. I'd figure a small company like that would be like, hey, check out our stuff.

29:40.200 --> 29:45.340
and check out our stuff. You know, whereas you got cocky people like Rockstar M that,

29:45.340 --> 29:50.000
you know, they're just like, ah, our stuff is too good for you. You'll see it and you'll

29:50.000 --> 29:54.920
buy it when it comes out. The end, you know, and to be honest, that is the truth. People

29:54.920 --> 30:00.400
will buy it because their stuff sells good and you know, you can't really compete with

30:00.400 --> 30:03.280
that. And whereas you think they would want people,

30:03.280 --> 30:08.000
the everyday other person to see it, like the folks at Kmart that worked there or whatever,

30:08.000 --> 30:11.480
see it and create the buzz they kind of don't have to do that sadly enough

30:11.480 --> 30:13.880
because the media creates the buzz for them.

30:13.880 --> 30:17.400
Well you know on a more grassroots level you know as far as what we've seen the

30:17.400 --> 30:21.040
buzz for us is all about things that were very easily accessible with very

30:21.040 --> 30:22.040
little lines.

30:22.040 --> 30:25.120
We heart Katamari for example is one of my favorite things I've seen at the show

30:25.120 --> 30:29.480
so far and a lot of that is because it was easy to play and I could like sit

30:29.480 --> 30:32.360
there for a while with it and really look into it and I had a great time with

30:32.360 --> 30:32.840
it.

30:32.840 --> 30:36.520
It's just like stuff like unreal 2007 or whatever it is

30:36.520 --> 30:39.300
I really don't care about that because you know what?

30:39.440 --> 30:44.060
I'm not gonna wait in line for an hour to see video that's gonna be on the internet the next day

30:44.320 --> 30:49.120
Like granted there are some people that would I mean some people wouldn't wait in line to see Zelda

30:49.120 --> 30:54.200
But you know, it's just whatever you're into I guess some but at least you get a free shirt with Zelda

30:54.200 --> 30:56.180
So I'm actually thinking tomorrow for me

30:56.180 --> 31:00.620
I may actually sit in that Zelda line because I also know some of our listeners want to know about it

31:00.620 --> 31:03.940
So if I sit in that three-hour line for you guys, you better be thankful

31:05.180 --> 31:07.180
Dan played it

31:07.460 --> 31:09.720
Controls exactly the same

31:11.060 --> 31:13.540
Like ocarina like when waker they're both the same

31:14.500 --> 31:16.260
but

31:16.260 --> 31:21.580
The the thing about it though is that he did say that it was pretty cool, but he got to meet me a little

31:23.260 --> 31:25.460
Yeah, so he said that he would have been pissed

31:26.580 --> 31:28.780
Had he gone and not got to meet me a little

31:28.780 --> 31:35.780
So I was like, ooh, Miyamoto, I get to touch Dan, and he got to meet Miyamoto.

31:35.780 --> 31:42.140
Another thing we saw today that was pretty cool was the Atari Flashback 2.0.

31:42.140 --> 31:44.860
It's awesome in its wood graininess.

31:44.860 --> 31:46.640
I can't wait to try that.

31:46.640 --> 31:48.960
It's not big like the old Atari.

31:48.960 --> 31:49.960
It's rather little.

31:49.960 --> 31:54.680
It's about the size of an 8x10 piece of paper, maybe even smaller, but it's wood grain and

31:54.680 --> 31:55.680
it's cute.

31:55.680 --> 31:57.500
It's so cute and precious.

31:57.500 --> 32:01.360
also showed me a brand new Nintendo system that someone made. It's like a third-party

32:01.360 --> 32:06.420
company created a new system that plays Nintendo games. And their brand new system, I guess,

32:06.420 --> 32:12.380
is because I didn't know there was this huge demand for Nintendo systems, but I don't know.

32:12.380 --> 32:15.700
So they made them and they're top-loading, just like the revised version.

32:15.700 --> 32:24.700
Well, you know what has made a striking absence, given all the hype around it, is Namco versus

32:24.700 --> 32:28.960
Capcom X Capcom with however they're doing would that be cross Capcom then

32:28.960 --> 32:35.060
anyway but at any rate or Namco by Capcom ha ha anyway we went to Capcom

32:35.060 --> 32:39.500
to go ask him back happens like go talk to me I'm cool so we trot over Namco

32:39.500 --> 32:43.460
well no at first I asked this one guys like you should ask the info desk here

32:43.460 --> 32:47.780
have a ad for final fight I'm like ooh another final fight sticker and then we

32:47.780 --> 32:54.300
went over because I like final fight and then we trotted over there and started

32:54.300 --> 32:59.980
talking to this guy at the Namco booth his name was Matt he was really cool

32:59.980 --> 33:04.380
he's like yeah well we don't have any information on it and that's like yeah

33:04.380 --> 33:08.900
Capcom just said go talk to me I'm cold so we did and he was really cool though

33:08.900 --> 33:13.180
but he's been following it online like the rest of us have and we're all

33:13.180 --> 33:16.540
excited but they don't have anything official right now you know what you're

33:16.540 --> 33:19.620
totally starting like a seventh-grade war because like you're going to one

33:19.620 --> 33:22.780
person saying this person's you know saying you got it and then you went to

33:22.780 --> 33:27.300
the other ones that hey Capcom Namco seeing you I know I'm teasing you that

33:27.300 --> 33:32.780
is not what I said at all cuz I don't do petty shit like that that's not cool I

33:32.780 --> 33:38.460
didn't basically I whenever is like no we don't know go talk to them I have to

33:38.460 --> 33:45.220
say though in comparison Namco's people have been a lot friendlier than Capcom's

33:45.220 --> 33:48.980
people there's just I've gone to some booths and just gotten complete and

33:48.980 --> 33:55.160
total apathy you're there to sell a damn product freaking act like it okay you

33:55.160 --> 33:58.240
are there to market yourselves you're there to make people want to do business

33:58.240 --> 34:04.000
with you is a fucking trade show you know Namco I have you know and you know

34:04.000 --> 34:09.480
I have lots of love for Namco they have gone out of their way to make the people

34:09.480 --> 34:15.740
visiting their area feel welcome they've had people running around with a little

34:15.740 --> 34:19.700
pac-man hats on handing out squishy things which they actually ran out of

34:19.700 --> 34:25.040
when I went to go play the Namco mobile games but they'll talk to you they'll

34:25.040 --> 34:29.640
build and they know what they're talking about the people are there because they

34:29.640 --> 34:34.040
truly enjoy doing what they're doing they're not there to be you know a piece

34:34.040 --> 34:39.240
of ass and a you know scrap of leather like the booth babes sorry it's true

34:39.240 --> 34:48.000
their tna in a you know like a quarter centimeter of leather you know but

34:48.000 --> 34:52.720
they've really gone out of their way in Nintendo Nintendo's people have been

34:52.720 --> 35:00.400
great you know they I got to talk to one of their representatives there and he

35:00.400 --> 35:04.760
was just as friendly as he could be and say yeah you should check this out and

35:04.760 --> 35:09.900
they're doing this and the guys handing out stuff when I played a Nintendo was

35:09.900 --> 35:17.480
funny and he gave me a bunch of style stylist stylist stylists is you know me

35:17.480 --> 35:24.800
in my grammar but it was those I have to say we're just the nicest people I've

35:24.800 --> 35:29.640
done the Korean guys at X tango they were like play with us it's fun you know

35:29.640 --> 35:35.960
after just in comparison it's amazing the differences between you know the

35:35.960 --> 35:41.280
attitude of people and when you go to the places that make you feel like your

35:41.280 --> 35:46.320
your business is welcome then that's where I'll get my business I've thrown a

35:46.320 --> 35:49.120
good word for Konami too because they've always been really good to us and of

35:49.120 --> 35:51.960
course but but it's kind of different with them because we actually kind of

35:51.960 --> 35:54.760
know a lot of the people at this point that work at the booth so you know just

35:54.760 --> 35:58.640
because obviously we started as a music and rhythm game station so you know

35:58.640 --> 36:04.400
we've kind of grown ties there well I actually didn't mention Konami just for

36:04.400 --> 36:11.520
that reason you know the fact that you know that's that's almost like saying

36:11.520 --> 36:15.960
that your cousin's a good worker when you hired you know but I don't know

36:15.960 --> 36:19.440
everyone there I mean I'd sound like a real pompous ass saying that but I don't

36:19.440 --> 36:23.160
know everyone there and even the folks I don't know are pretty nice and ask if I

36:23.160 --> 36:29.100
questions and stuff. Yeah, it's kind of hard when, you know, the people up on

36:29.100 --> 36:33.600
the stage by BeatMania are friends of yours. You know, of course you expect to be

36:33.600 --> 36:37.640
friendly from your friends, but I'm just saying, you know, for the other people, the

36:37.640 --> 36:41.160
ones we don't know as well, you know, just seeing that difference in attitude,

36:41.160 --> 36:46.900
Capcom was just apathy. Playing out, we don't want to be here, we're bored, end the

36:46.900 --> 36:52.560
con, and I can't, you know, I can't handle that. I actually had a kind of a weird

36:52.560 --> 36:56.160
experience at Capcom last year and it's kind of made me not just I kind of walk

36:56.160 --> 36:59.000
by their booth and I was like man is there anything I want to see no not

36:59.000 --> 37:04.000
really Oh a beautiful joke coffee and not worth waiting for no the guy there

37:04.000 --> 37:07.600
that he was cool we chatted with him a little bit he stood back so I could take

37:07.600 --> 37:13.040
a picture of the machine that was really awesome told me when to come back he was

37:13.040 --> 37:17.480
cool and the guy by Final Fight he was you know said what he knew but like the

37:17.480 --> 37:21.040
press people the people at the desk that's where I had my back experience I

37:21.040 --> 37:24.240
had this woman laughing my face last year one of the people behind the desk

37:24.240 --> 37:28.520
totally inappropriate yeah but I got a press kit out of them that last year in

37:28.520 --> 37:38.360
this year she can suck it in it will it's just it's just the level of how

37:38.360 --> 37:41.960
people are dealt with you know again this is a trade show you are there to

37:41.960 --> 37:45.760
market yourself and you were there ultimately to get business that's not

37:45.760 --> 37:47.880
the way you go about getting business I'm sorry

37:47.880 --> 37:52.520
You know, we we cover the video game news and the that's part of the news, I think

37:53.640 --> 37:58.200
Yep, so I mean and this is not something you're gonna read about on those big sites

37:58.200 --> 38:03.980
They're not gonna tell you the attitudes the way it really is when you go to e3 people's attitudes a different booth

38:04.020 --> 38:08.860
That's the kind of stuff. You're only gonna hear here on Orange Launch Radio. So on that note

38:08.860 --> 38:13.500
I think we're gonna wrap it up. I think we've all we've all gotten what in what we're gonna look at tomorrow, right?

38:13.500 --> 38:18.440
Are we going to wrap it up in a scrap of leather like a booth babe?

38:18.440 --> 38:19.440
We just might.

38:19.440 --> 38:22.880
You know, I tried to find H-Tech's booth so I could find the anti-booth babes today.

38:22.880 --> 38:27.320
I could only find their little room and the woman working in the room was an attractive

38:27.320 --> 38:28.320
gal.

38:28.320 --> 38:32.400
She wasn't a booth babe gal, you know, your stereotypical blonde hair, blue eye, big titty

38:32.400 --> 38:33.400
booth babe.

38:33.400 --> 38:36.300
But she was an attractive female, you know.

38:36.300 --> 38:42.800
So I have to figure out where this anti-booth babe granny panty campaign is going on.

38:42.800 --> 38:48.400
Would you really want to be one of those women? Oh, yeah, you're the ugly person that gets the promoter game

38:49.080 --> 38:50.440
Thanks

38:50.440 --> 38:53.320
yeah, well we kind of talked about that last Sunday, but I

38:54.400 --> 38:57.040
Did I was sad I didn't get a chance to get his picture

38:57.040 --> 38:59.800
They had people doing KOF like cosplay

38:59.800 --> 39:06.240
you know there's part of their thing and I walked right past someone who was K and he was hot and I was like

39:08.240 --> 39:10.780
And he went outside to have a spoke

39:10.780 --> 39:17.780
So there you have it, your first booth stud report. So there you go. Alright, final thoughts everybody. Loki.

39:17.780 --> 39:30.780
Well, let's see. My final thought is I got to see a donkey and I took my picture with Mario even though I didn't want to.

39:30.780 --> 39:38.780
And tomorrow I'm just looking forward to kind of going home because I'm tired.

39:38.780 --> 39:45.700
And my final thought is thank you one up calm for the mango smoothie that I didn't have to pay five dollars for

39:48.300 --> 39:50.300
Mine is I

39:51.500 --> 39:53.500
Really really really really we

39:54.500 --> 39:57.800
