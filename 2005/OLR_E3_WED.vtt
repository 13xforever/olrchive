Now here are your hosts dark Sakura sky and low

00:21.200 --> 00:25.320
Okay, we don't have a fancy introduction tonight, we're just gonna kind of roll into things and get started

00:25.320 --> 00:28.880
We did promise you guys we're gonna give you guys some live updates from e3

00:28.880 --> 00:34.360
My name is Rob Roberts. You might know me as sky joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts starting off with Loki

00:34.480 --> 00:41.540
Hi, I'm here and my feet hurt like crazy. I know the feeling walking around all day also with us Jamie Summers dark Sakura

00:41.540 --> 00:43.360
Hey, hey, the gang's all here

00:43.360 --> 00:43.980
All right

00:43.980 --> 00:47.120
So we don't have a whole lot of time tonight because we're trying to run between doing different things

00:47.120 --> 00:49.540
But let's get the lowdown Wednesday show

00:49.760 --> 00:53.020
Let's start off with the big news a lot of our folks out there

00:53.300 --> 00:56.500
Want to know about the music games because that's how we started was with the music game

00:56.500 --> 00:59.540
So, of course, we have Dance Dance Revolution Xtreme 2.

00:59.540 --> 01:01.180
Loki, would you think of Xtreme 2?

01:01.180 --> 01:02.940
I thought it was pretty cool.

01:02.940 --> 01:07.100
The characters have been cleaned up quite a bit, and also there's, you know, new songs

01:07.100 --> 01:08.100
to be excited about.

01:08.100 --> 01:12.860
A brand new song, which I cannot remember the title for the life of me, but had a nice,

01:12.860 --> 01:15.820
really kick-ass CG background to it.

01:15.820 --> 01:16.820
Nice animation.

01:16.820 --> 01:18.940
It was a pretty cool song, too.

01:18.940 --> 01:25.140
There was some pretty good songs shown off there for that, and they, I don't know, looked

01:25.140 --> 01:26.140
pretty nice.

01:26.140 --> 01:29.860
tell you Erotic in the Heat of the Night is there so that's gonna be pretty cool

01:29.860 --> 01:34.380
for the US fans who have been wanting to see Erotic for some time. Also Genie in a Bottle, little

01:34.380 --> 01:40.460
weird, not Christina Aguilera, it's a cover version but it's there nonetheless. Also

01:40.460 --> 01:44.980
online play was being shown off in the demo so that is confirmed it is going to

01:44.980 --> 01:52.300
be there so that's very exciting. That is cool. Anything else you want to point out about Xtreme 2? The logo looked cool. It did, it did.

01:52.300 --> 02:01.300
Ultramix 3, another very impressive one. Very similar to Ultramix 2, I thought, but with more of like a water theme as opposed to kind of what it had before.

02:01.300 --> 02:10.300
Yeah, it's very water, it's all like water themed, as opposed to like some generic like club rave thing in Ultramix 2.

02:10.300 --> 02:12.300
New Midihead Remix.

02:12.300 --> 02:15.300
Yeah, very cool. New Midihead Remix, Jelly Kiss, showing up in the game.

02:15.300 --> 02:17.300
Jelly Kiss, and...

02:17.300 --> 02:20.300
Butterfly, making its US debut in Ultramix 3.

02:20.300 --> 02:21.300
Ultra Mix 3.

02:21.300 --> 02:25.820
Butterfly and guess what folks, for all those people bitching about Ultra Mix 2, Sakura's

02:25.820 --> 02:26.820
in there!

02:26.820 --> 02:29.900
Sakura made it's way to Ultra Mix 3, as well as Daikonkai, another fan favorite.

02:29.900 --> 02:32.540
Daikonkai made it in there, and Akuma Dracula Medley.

02:32.540 --> 02:36.900
Yeah, Akuma Dracula Medley, very excited about that one, I've been crazy for that one for

02:36.900 --> 02:38.020
years, so I'm excited about that.

02:38.020 --> 02:42.900
And then of course, big news, Beatmania, it's not 2DX, they're not calling it 2DX here,

02:42.900 --> 02:47.180
but if you guys are fans of 2DX in Japan, they're bringing it over to the USA, Beatmania,

02:47.180 --> 02:48.860
here's the coolest thing about it.

02:48.860 --> 02:53.800
If you go into 5 key mode, typically in Beatmania, dropping, going into 5 key mode will drop

02:53.800 --> 02:56.780
the last 2 keys in 7 key mode and you just play the same thing.

02:56.780 --> 02:57.780
Not so here.

02:57.780 --> 03:00.480
You actually get all new 5 key songs.

03:00.480 --> 03:01.480
It's awesome.

03:01.480 --> 03:07.020
So like Metal, what was the Metal Gear Solid theme was in there, the Solid Snake, Paranoia.

03:07.020 --> 03:08.020
Very excited about that.

03:08.020 --> 03:10.580
I didn't get to play it because I suck at Beatmania.

03:10.580 --> 03:11.580
That's alright.

03:11.580 --> 03:14.740
They had headphones there so you could at least hear the stuff because it's like in

03:14.740 --> 03:17.920
their Club Revolution section there.

03:17.920 --> 03:21.400
fucking loud because they have this giant speaker right there so it sucked

03:21.400 --> 03:26.700
dancing also coming to karaoke revolution karaoke revolution party

03:26.700 --> 03:33.000
xbox gamecube and PlayStation gonna be on all three all three it's dancing and

03:33.000 --> 03:36.440
singing if you want you don't have to play but kind of crazy all that stuff

03:36.440 --> 03:40.980
going on the screen one that was really cool is you gotta go back to Ultramix 3

03:40.980 --> 03:45.600
here quest mode that was really strange it's actually got like you know cities

03:45.600 --> 03:51.000
You know that are you know actual cities throughout the United States you go and come you go through the capitals of the USA

03:51.000 --> 03:55.620
We start off in Sacramento right where we're based. I like that. I love that yes very cool

03:55.620 --> 04:01.040
And they have super deformed heads and super deformed emmy head. That's cool. We'll have pictures on our website orange

04:01.040 --> 04:05.000
I was ready to calm very soon um dark soccer. What do you think of the music selections available Konami?

04:05.680 --> 04:12.900
I actually I didn't hang around too long, but I did I tried to play jelly kiss except my hip decided

04:12.900 --> 04:19.860
But hey, you know your Viking hasn't kicked in yet. So I ended up having to stumble off of it, but I did play beat mania

04:21.100 --> 04:25.940
Whatever it was that I played was supposed to be a six star and it was more like a one

04:26.500 --> 04:28.920
So I don't think that they're completely up to

04:31.940 --> 04:39.300
But I I did wander around and check some of the peripherals out is that tried the one at DDR game calm and

04:39.300 --> 04:42.500
and their metal pad's pretty decent, but there's a delay on it.

04:42.500 --> 04:47.300
It's cushy! I played Superstar. Actually, by then, mine was when it kicked in.

04:47.300 --> 04:51.900
But there's a delay on it, I can tell, because you know, Superstar's one of my old PA ones.

04:51.900 --> 04:56.100
And, eh, the video wasn't bad.

04:56.100 --> 04:59.380
Speaking of peripherals, we got a chance to check out Red Octane's booth, and they were

04:59.380 --> 05:02.380
showing off their afterburner pad, but kind of funny enough, they did not

05:02.380 --> 05:05.980
have any games on display. They were showing in the groove. They're still

05:05.980 --> 05:08.860
showing off in the groove, and for those wondering about the lawsuit, is it gonna

05:08.860 --> 05:13.100
affect the release we were told no in the groove will come out home release

05:13.100 --> 05:16.460
mid-june mid-june it's being pushed back to mid-june but it is coming out

05:16.460 --> 05:19.460
that's what games are games are always pushed around I did talk to the rep

05:19.460 --> 05:24.220
there and he said this is as close to quote as I can come

05:24.220 --> 05:26.940
he said they're going to continue to market it until there's something

05:26.940 --> 05:31.900
actually published in terms of a lawsuit for those curious about the lawsuit it

05:31.900 --> 05:35.220
does not involve red octane if you if you've read the list on the DDR free

05:35.220 --> 05:40.420
made available the actual printouts of the suit. Red Octane was never mentioned

05:40.420 --> 05:44.040
in it so they're going ahead with this release so it's it's good for us in the

05:44.040 --> 05:48.180
end. And we decided to ask them about their other games that have been posted.

05:48.180 --> 05:55.340
Guitar Hero. Guitar Hero and it sounds pretty cool so far they had to be very

05:55.340 --> 05:59.220
vague on it. It is gonna be five key guitar controls which is very exciting.

05:59.220 --> 06:06.460
from what I heard someone played it and there's a whammy bar and sort of from

06:06.460 --> 06:12.780
the way the notes sound like it's kind of like anyone remembers well of course

06:12.780 --> 06:16.420
everyone remembers like amplitude or something like that where the notes kind

06:16.420 --> 06:21.980
of come towards you same same idea so honestly if you're a music game fan this

06:21.980 --> 06:25.280
was the year for you DER with Mario was shown not a Konami though they showed it

06:25.280 --> 06:30.560
over at Nintendo. Kind of bare bones what I saw. I didn't get to see a whole lot of

06:30.560 --> 06:34.360
it. I'm going to tell you what, I played a song on Very Hard and I triple-a'd it my first

06:34.360 --> 06:38.600
try. So the timing window's really big. But let's face it, DDR Mario is for kids. It's

06:38.600 --> 06:44.240
not going to be for the hardcore folks. It's to make it more kid accessible. I had a good

06:44.240 --> 06:47.460
time with it. There was a lot of Mario remixes. No licensed songs I saw in it, just a bunch

06:47.460 --> 06:48.880
of remixed Nintendo tunes.

06:48.880 --> 06:55.880
I also asked the Red Octane people if, you know, they have a guitar peripheral.

06:55.880 --> 07:00.480
I'm like, have you guys ever released a drum peripheral and you kinda smelled where I was,

07:00.480 --> 07:01.480
you know, going with that?

07:01.480 --> 07:07.120
And he's like, well I can't be, I have to be very vague on that, but we'll, we're working

07:07.120 --> 07:08.120
on something.

07:08.120 --> 07:10.080
You get a nice we'll see from that.

07:10.080 --> 07:13.480
Alright, now, not everybody that listens to our shows is into music games, so let's talk

07:13.480 --> 07:15.600
about some of the other things we saw at the show today.

07:15.600 --> 07:19.180
like pick three highlights we'll go around talk about three highlights dark

07:19.180 --> 07:24.500
soccer wants to start us off I spent a lot of time at Nintendo so I played

07:24.500 --> 07:31.980
Animal Crossing DS lots of fun it has the world itself is very spherical you

07:31.980 --> 07:36.180
actually feel like you're walking on a small little planet I was very impressed

07:36.180 --> 07:39.540
because Animal Crossing DS is not just a rehashed GameCube version they actually

07:39.540 --> 07:43.460
went back and redid all the graphics and the interface and at the show you could

07:43.460 --> 07:47.020
play against someone who is sitting in New York City and I promised I would

07:47.020 --> 07:50.420
give a shout out but I forgot her name I'm very sorry I played against Charles

07:50.420 --> 07:57.740
the voice of Mario Mario Kart and he called me a lovely lady awesome you know

07:57.740 --> 08:01.860
when I met him last year I said it's a you all right what so Animal Crossing

08:01.860 --> 08:05.820
what and it was pretty fun I went around twirling my umbrella which he said I was

08:05.820 --> 08:08.980
very good at and then he was going around whacking everybody else with the

08:08.980 --> 08:13.060
with the bug catching that says he's like any cat chasing the person with the

08:13.060 --> 08:17.400
Pirate hat cuz he said it's fun to hit the pirate with the net and then I played

08:18.460 --> 08:20.840
Pokemon DX. I'm sorry XD

08:21.580 --> 08:23.780
Which actually I played it just for the plushie

08:24.820 --> 08:26.940
XD like the smiley face. Yeah, like

08:27.500 --> 08:31.820
But it was actually pretty cool. It's a it's a big old big old RPG and

08:32.620 --> 08:37.160
You play against all the up-to-date Pokemon, you know, it's you know, the typical stadium style

08:37.860 --> 08:41.000
Battle, but it was really cool. I actually enjoyed it

08:41.000 --> 08:46.660
Um, I took a couple pictures. I took pictures about everything. I played except for the DS ones

08:47.180 --> 08:50.900
And actually I played Nintendogs

08:51.540 --> 08:58.780
He's a good puppy cuz you do the the frisbee and then they they sit on it and they're stupid and then you tap the screen

08:58.780 --> 09:00.780
Oh, you want this?

09:01.640 --> 09:07.260
Pat on the head and then you grab it and then no you can't know you through this you don't keep it anymore

09:07.260 --> 09:14.320
I'm keeping it says the puppy. No, no, no, you're going to give me cuz I'm no says the puppy

09:14.320 --> 09:16.320
I'm going to pull it out

09:22.400 --> 09:25.040
That's a beautiful description of Nintendogs, thank you. I

09:25.840 --> 09:31.960
Wonder if they'll have been 10 cats. I talked to the guy about it. He's like you don't really train a cat

09:31.960 --> 09:33.960
I was like, yeah the cat trains you

09:34.560 --> 09:36.440
human food now

09:36.440 --> 09:39.080
So that's your three for now all Nintendo, that's all right

09:39.520 --> 09:44.680
Yeah, but one of the fun things is though picked her chatting with random people in the lines. It was great

09:45.320 --> 09:47.840
Dude, speaking of random things going on in the line

09:47.840 --> 09:52.560
We were standing next to Gary Coleman this morning and like didn't even realize it and then Hideo Kojima walked by

09:52.560 --> 09:59.040
It was so weird like and then I stood next to that chick from g4 TV comm the one that's blonde spiky here granted

09:59.040 --> 10:01.040
I hate her crazy, but she's still hot

10:01.040 --> 10:06.360
You know, it's just an on-air thing. I'm sure she's nice gal. All right, she seemed nice when I saw her

10:06.360 --> 10:12.760
They're all nice, I'm sure. You know, fear me. I am, you all-knowing host. They're paid to be weird, that's why we're not on TV.

10:12.760 --> 10:17.480
We're a little too not weird for TV. I'm paid to be- no, wait, I'm not paid to be weird. All right. Anyway, anyway

10:18.000 --> 10:22.200
Loki, your three highlights for today. Okay. Well, it would be, you know,

10:22.200 --> 10:29.040
it wouldn't be a show if I didn't start off with, like, I don't know. Let's just start off with Advent Children, which in

10:29.040 --> 10:35.680
Square Enix's that's how they pronounce it but it's wrong it's Gweenix we all

10:35.680 --> 10:41.320
know that anyways in their and their little rehashed movie thing that they

10:41.320 --> 10:47.600
did last year they have you know new footage of Advent Children and teeth of

10:47.600 --> 10:54.360
fighting in the Cathedral hot oh freaking hot I mean I know that stuff's

10:54.360 --> 10:58.280
gonna be on GameSpot later and I'm sure they're gonna have you know video for it

10:58.280 --> 11:02.740
Watch it. Oh, oh very hot. Anyway, so they have that that was cool

11:03.860 --> 11:08.920
The second thing that I actually got to do which is kind of neat. I got the tryouts

11:09.460 --> 11:12.640
We love katamari and that was a lot of fun

11:13.440 --> 11:17.720
That's you. Oh, it's so much fun. And you just I picked up the flowers

11:17.720 --> 11:19.240
It's everything that you know

11:19.240 --> 11:25.800
The old katamari was and it's just better and with the same humor the same great graphics

11:25.800 --> 11:30.800
and it's just a lot of fun still so it just mirrors the king's package even

11:30.800 --> 11:38.080
bigger I don't know but it was pretty funny then they had what else did I play

11:38.080 --> 11:44.160
that was really cool oh well I got to try a little bit of and I can't remember

11:44.160 --> 11:51.400
what the title is I can only remember the subtitle it's like something

11:51.400 --> 11:56.600
something something contents under pressure it's that tagging game where

11:56.600 --> 11:59.880
you actually spray paint buildings and stuff I played that for a little bit but

11:59.880 --> 12:05.260
it was weird because I was tagging stuff and all sudden like SWAT comes with guns

12:05.260 --> 12:08.480
and they start shooting at me I'm like that's a little harsh for someone that's

12:08.480 --> 12:12.560
just tagging a building but just that radio does that well it's very similar

12:12.560 --> 12:16.240
and then so I had to fight them off of the paint roller and guess what guns are

12:16.240 --> 12:19.960
stronger than paint rollers so it didn't worked out too well you can't kill SWAT

12:19.960 --> 12:26.160
with paint rollers. So those are the three. Oh, one more thing I would like to

12:26.160 --> 12:31.720
interject in there. Nintendo has done it again. They want you to buy

12:31.720 --> 12:35.660
the Game Boy Advance again. Yes, the Game Boy Micro we got to see today. Actually, I

12:35.660 --> 12:38.560
want to get start getting to some mail and then I'll get to my three. Oh yes,

12:38.560 --> 12:43.000
Dark Sakura. I did take a very up-close picture of one, so that'll be available soon.

12:43.000 --> 12:46.840
As did I. I'm gonna get to the mail. If you have a question for us, hurry up. You

12:46.840 --> 12:50.240
You gotta write us right now, E3 at OrangeLoungeRadio.com,

12:50.240 --> 12:52.500
and we'll be checking this box, such as these questions

12:52.500 --> 12:55.240
that came in from Sunday show, and we'll answer these.

12:55.240 --> 12:57.420
If you have something you want us to check into on the show,

12:57.420 --> 12:59.020
remember we can't get to everything,

12:59.020 --> 13:00.260
and if you send us a big list,

13:00.260 --> 13:02.180
we'll probably only be able to get to one or two,

13:02.180 --> 13:03.440
but we wanna try and help you guys out.

13:03.440 --> 13:05.120
Michael N. actually wanted more information

13:05.120 --> 13:06.420
on the Game Boy Micro.

13:06.420 --> 13:07.260
What is it?

13:07.260 --> 13:09.100
Well, the Game Boy Micro is like a Game Boy Advance,

13:09.100 --> 13:10.500
but it's the size of your palm.

13:10.500 --> 13:11.340
It's very small.

13:11.340 --> 13:12.280
This is the coolest thing about it.

13:12.280 --> 13:13.600
You know how we usually bag on Nintendo,

13:13.600 --> 13:15.420
because they make you buy the same thing

13:15.420 --> 13:19.680
different times to get it in different colors. Well, the face is detachable, kind of like

13:19.680 --> 13:23.560
a car stereo, so you can actually change the face and they have like a red face and a blue

13:23.560 --> 13:27.680
face and like a baseball looking face and all these strange things. Any other impressions

13:27.680 --> 13:32.440
on the Game Boy Micro, you guys? It's little! I mean, and it's supposed to also have double

13:32.440 --> 13:37.320
the battery power, too. Yeah. So, you can just keep it on indefinitely, maybe? The screen's

13:37.320 --> 13:43.920
like half the size. Honestly, the Game Boy Advance games, I don't think, are that good

13:43.920 --> 13:45.800
anymore it's just there's nothing really

13:45.800 --> 13:47.880
gameboy advance it what I really want I

13:47.880 --> 13:51.940
noticed so it's slightly larger than say

13:51.940 --> 13:54.040
a gameboy advance cartridge I mean

13:54.040 --> 13:56.440
maybe a bit larger than that but it's

13:56.440 --> 13:58.640
just it looks like a cell phone screen I

13:58.640 --> 14:02.360
mean and really it doesn't look like

14:02.360 --> 14:04.240
playing it on so honestly it's like if I

14:04.240 --> 14:06.960
had a gameboy advance SP or original

14:06.960 --> 14:08.440
game where it's I wouldn't really buy

14:08.440 --> 14:10.680
this it's cute though it's kids cute but

14:10.680 --> 14:13.320
it's like really I mean gameboy advance

14:13.320 --> 14:18.940
SP it pretty much fits in your pocket. Do you really need I mean hell a DS fits in my pocket, so

14:19.580 --> 14:25.600
Okay, um let's move on. I want to get some questions from Desmond are had a question about Nintendo DS online

14:25.600 --> 14:29.980
Um the only thing I caught on to it is that it will allow you through game spy

14:29.980 --> 14:35.140
I think it was to play with folks around the nation Animal Crossing a Mario Kart with the two titles

14:35.140 --> 14:38.220
They were showing for this how it works. I didn't quite catch on the day yet

14:38.220 --> 14:41.680
I'm hopeful have more information also voiceover IP chat there was that too

14:41.680 --> 14:46.120
which actually if anyone's ever seen the commercial the Cisco commercials where

14:46.120 --> 14:48.960
they have the US marketing team and the Japanese marketing team and they're

14:48.960 --> 14:51.960
playing they put this phone back on there I just use that phone at work it

14:51.960 --> 14:55.080
uses your internet line as your phone line almost kind of like our Skype does

14:55.080 --> 15:01.720
similarly except it's carried over an internet signal um Jin sent us a really

15:01.720 --> 15:05.800
big list and I think actually it's Jin four or five seven I apologize if I

15:05.800 --> 15:09.040
screwed up your number four five seven six I think but who cares it's Jin it's

15:09.040 --> 15:13.400
Awesome, uh Soulcalibur 3 create a character, you know, the demo was a little skimpy

15:13.400 --> 15:18.500
We only saw Mitsuru Yugi versus one of the new characters one with a giant chakra. I can't remember her name T

15:18.720 --> 15:22.720
I'm really sorry guys. I don't cheat. I don't use papers. I've got I think it was Tina or

15:23.240 --> 15:27.480
Terra something they were the only two playable ones in the demo didn't see a lot of created characters

15:27.480 --> 15:31.860
Sorry to say hopefully we'll know more information on that soon one more information also on Final Fantasy 12

15:31.860 --> 15:36.740
CG looks amazing. I think they went back and retooled it because it looks like

15:36.740 --> 15:41.860
Advent Children. And I think that what they're gonna be doing is releasing it for the PS3.

15:41.860 --> 15:45.260
That's our thought. That's our thought is that because they weren't showing

15:45.260 --> 15:48.580
playable versions of it we but we don't want to start rumors but we think it

15:48.580 --> 15:54.660
almost looks too good to be on PS2. Either that or it's dev kit. Possibly I

15:54.660 --> 15:59.740
mean we don't know. And then let's do one more mail here from Same wanted to know

15:59.740 --> 16:02.660
more information on Pokemon which I think you kind of touched on already

16:02.660 --> 16:07.380
Katamari also we heart Katamari which you touched on a little bit I just

16:07.380 --> 16:11.100
wanted to say that the demo version they have was specifically for e3 and it was

16:11.100 --> 16:14.380
great because you know just had that style in it and not has the king of

16:14.380 --> 16:18.380
cosmos sitting cross-legged looking like a diva the mode I played you roll up as

16:18.380 --> 16:21.820
many flowers as you can so it sounds like they have some different style

16:21.820 --> 16:25.100
types of quests I also saw the classroom one which is pretty yeah there was a

16:25.100 --> 16:29.620
classroom and a field one as well okay we do have to wrap things up pretty soon

16:29.620 --> 16:35.320
soon here but we saw the giant katamari that they had there and it was funny

16:35.320 --> 16:38.120
because one of the things that someone had stuck on there is I don't know if

16:38.120 --> 16:41.920
anyone's heard about this for the Nintendo DS they had you know touching

16:41.920 --> 16:47.960
is good thing and you can actually send in to get your own you know mannequin

16:47.960 --> 16:52.360
hand and someone had put the mannequin hand on the large katamari and that was

16:52.360 --> 16:56.280
hilarious alright so if you guys have any any other e3 questions e3 at orange

16:56.280 --> 16:59.360
lounge radio calm now before we go just one other thing real quick Oh Dark

16:59.360 --> 17:04.520
has a thought X tango has more stuff in it and looks awesome and they are in

17:04.520 --> 17:08.480
talks with developers this year I miss that I hope to check that one out

17:08.480 --> 17:13.040
tomorrow briefly as I walk past like Oh X tangos here I did I didn't get us

17:13.040 --> 17:15.600
spend a lot of time on West Hall or Kenshi today I'm hoping spend more time

17:15.600 --> 17:21.000
there I can't no I yeah I I know and I missed it it's completely somehow let's

17:21.000 --> 17:24.360
see so I just want to go through thing you were most looking forward to that

17:24.360 --> 17:26.760
maybe disappointed you a little bit because I have something on the top of

17:26.760 --> 17:29.860
My mind and that would be the Nintendo DS download station

17:29.860 --> 17:31.580
I was really looking forward to it

17:31.580 --> 17:36.740
But it was it was hammered with people and the rooms were full and it was hard to get anything on there

17:36.740 --> 17:40.860
But I was it I just went and sat down and used the DS as they had there

17:41.060 --> 17:44.300
And I did get to play medios, which was very cool. I'm sad

17:44.300 --> 17:47.420
I didn't get to hear the music though because I hear the music is very cool, but the game itself

17:48.220 --> 17:51.840
Simple yet addicting. I I'm looking forward to playing this one in more detail

17:51.840 --> 17:55.060
You guys have any thoughts thing you were looking forward to that maybe disappointed you a little bit

17:55.060 --> 18:01.620
I went in with no expectations and they were met probably smarter than me

18:01.620 --> 18:05.100
not stars booth that was a huge disappointment because they had a bunch

18:05.100 --> 18:08.420
of buses with logos on them and nothing playable

18:08.420 --> 18:11.940
yep the I think you have to be media to get in there so we don't count podcasts

18:11.940 --> 18:16.100
aren't real media I guess yet so we weren't able to get in there so we don't

18:16.100 --> 18:19.860
know you know rockstar stop right sorry you know honestly rockstar and they have

18:19.860 --> 18:23.740
a new game warriors which is I think based on that 1970 some movie with you

18:23.740 --> 18:27.540
know Michael Beck or whatever anyways you know basically the same damn thing

18:27.540 --> 18:32.020
all over again just another genre whatever it's it's like come on Rockstar

18:32.020 --> 18:35.860
do something different so Rockstar gets our thumbs down of the day for not

18:35.860 --> 18:39.220
showing and they do this all the time too they never show anything and also I'm

18:39.220 --> 18:44.780
very disappointed on swag not a lot swag this year I beg to differ because I have

18:44.780 --> 18:51.860
Pokemon and I have t-shirts and I have press kits and I have puppies and also

18:51.860 --> 18:57.320
big disappointment to Sony and Nintendo for constantly tripping the breakers

18:57.320 --> 19:02.120
there and causing power outages in their little hall there. And also kind of a

19:02.120 --> 19:05.360
thumbs down to people wanting you to wait in line for their show. Everybody's

19:05.360 --> 19:09.440
got a line and it's a half hour long. Too bad. Freaking thumbs up though cuz there's

19:09.440 --> 19:13.820
a new Final Fight game, another one to add to the collection. Cuz some people

19:13.820 --> 19:18.500
who've known me for some time, I collect versions of Final Fight. I have Final Fight

19:18.500 --> 19:23.340
guy mighty final fight now have me a new one all right we're gonna wrap it up

19:23.340 --> 19:28.300
here final thoughts you guys Matt tomorrow I'm gonna wait in line for

19:28.300 --> 19:33.980
Nintendo and I'm waiting in line to see the ps3 and Xbox can suck it because in

19:33.980 --> 19:37.860
order to play their game you have to be media but you can look down upon it on a

19:37.860 --> 19:41.660
wonderful platform well the hell with them you know what I'm not buying your

19:41.660 --> 19:46.820
stupid Xbox 360 so you can shove it okay cuz I am buying that crap I don't care

19:46.820 --> 19:49.640
How good it was an opinion is expressed of low-key do not necessarily

19:49.640 --> 19:54.280
Oh also the new console systems are ugly except for the Xbox 360 there's irony for you

19:54.600 --> 20:01.600
Do the Xbox 360 show that they did was freaking pretty quake for ha ha ha ha federal life for ha ha

20:01.720 --> 20:03.520
You know if I were a man

20:03.520 --> 20:07.840
I would have walked around the whole rest of the con with a big boner the whole time, but I'm not um

20:09.040 --> 20:13.840
But my final thought is I'm kind of pissed off that they wouldn't let me put a reject false icon sticker on the Katamari oh

20:13.840 --> 20:17.600
That stinks. My final thought is

20:17.600 --> 20:21.280
Sony and I are spending some quality time together tomorrow.

20:21.280 --> 20:25.160
