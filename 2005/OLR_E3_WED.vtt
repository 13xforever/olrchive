00:00.490 --> 00:04.511
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition live at E3 Wednesday Edition.

00:06.472 --> 00:14.435
[SPEAKER_00]: You're tuned in to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your podcast home for all the latest video game news and gamer chat.

00:14.655 --> 00:18.096
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.

00:21.513 --> 00:22.114
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie Summers, Dark Sakura

00:42.290 --> 00:43.372
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, hey, the gang's all here.

00:43.752 --> 00:48.459
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so we don't have a whole lot of time tonight because we're trying to run between doing different things, but let's get the lowdown.

00:48.819 --> 00:51.503
[SPEAKER_02]: Wednesday's show, let's start off with the big news.

00:52.023 --> 00:57.491
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of our folks out there want to know about the music games because that's how we started was with the music games, so of course we have...

00:57.851 --> 00:59.492
[SPEAKER_02]: Dance Dance Revolution Extreme 2.

00:59.532 --> 01:00.853
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, what did you think of Extreme 2?

01:01.293 --> 01:02.433
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was pretty cool.

01:02.954 --> 01:08.036
[SPEAKER_03]: The characters have been cleaned up quite a bit, and also there's new songs to be excited about.

01:08.056 --> 01:14.840
[SPEAKER_03]: A brand new song, which I cannot remember the title for the life of me, but had a nice, really kick-ass CG background to it.

01:15.720 --> 01:16.540
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice animation.

01:17.201 --> 01:18.381
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a pretty cool song, too.

01:18.862 --> 01:22.704
[SPEAKER_03]: There was some pretty good songs shown off there for that, and...

01:24.144 --> 01:25.045
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

01:32.651 --> 01:36.213
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, Genie in a Bottle, a little weird, not Christina Aguilera.

01:36.273 --> 01:38.434
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a cover version, but it's there nonetheless.

01:40.175 --> 01:44.517
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, online play was being shown off in the demo, so that is confirmed.

01:44.537 --> 01:46.398
[SPEAKER_02]: It is going to be there, so that's very exciting.

01:46.458 --> 01:47.018
[SPEAKER_02]: That is cool.

01:47.118 --> 01:48.839
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything else you want to point out about Xtreme 2?

01:50.080 --> 01:50.820
[SPEAKER_02]: The logo looked cool.

01:51.641 --> 01:52.261
[SPEAKER_02]: It did, it did.

01:53.402 --> 01:55.543
[SPEAKER_02]: Ultramix 3, another very impressive one.

01:55.603 --> 01:57.604
[SPEAKER_02]: Very similar to Ultramix 2, I thought.

01:57.944 --> 02:01.705
[SPEAKER_02]: But with more of like a water theme as opposed to kind of what it had before.

02:01.925 --> 02:03.326
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's very water.

02:03.546 --> 02:10.788
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all like water themed as opposed to like some generic like club rave thing in Ultramix 2.

02:12.009 --> 02:13.109
[SPEAKER_03]: New Midi Head Remix.

02:13.169 --> 02:13.829
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, very cool.

02:13.889 --> 02:14.650
[SPEAKER_02]: New Midi Head Remix.

02:14.690 --> 02:15.810
[SPEAKER_02]: Jelly Kiss showing up in the game.

02:15.830 --> 02:18.171
[SPEAKER_03]: Jelly Kiss.

02:18.311 --> 02:20.612
[SPEAKER_02]: Butterfly making its US debut in Ultramix 3.

02:20.652 --> 02:21.252
[SPEAKER_02]: Butterfly.

02:21.312 --> 02:22.292
[SPEAKER_03]: And guess what, folks?

02:22.652 --> 02:24.233
[SPEAKER_03]: For all those people bitching about Ultramix 2...

02:24.973 --> 02:26.413
[SPEAKER_02]: Sakura's in there!

02:26.433 --> 02:29.934
[SPEAKER_02]: Sakura made its way to Ultramix 3, as well as Daikinkai, another fan favorite.

02:29.954 --> 02:32.515
[SPEAKER_03]: Daikinkai made it in there, and Akuma Dracula Medley.

02:32.635 --> 02:37.876
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Akuma Dracula Medley, very excited about that one, I've been crazy for that one for years, so I'm excited about that.

02:37.936 --> 02:48.159
[SPEAKER_02]: And then of course, big news, Beatmania, it's not 2DX, they're not calling it 2DX here, but if you guys are fans of 2DX in Japan, they're bringing it over to the USA, Beatmania, here's the coolest thing about it.

02:48.837 --> 02:56.282
[SPEAKER_02]: If you go into five key mode, typically in Beatmania, going into five key mode will drop the last two keys of seven key mode and you just play the same thing.

02:56.662 --> 02:57.263
[SPEAKER_02]: Not so here.

02:57.323 --> 03:00.025
[SPEAKER_02]: You actually get all new five key songs.

03:00.425 --> 03:00.905
[SPEAKER_02]: It's awesome.

03:01.306 --> 03:04.508
[SPEAKER_02]: So like what was the Metal Gear Solid theme was in there?

03:05.789 --> 03:06.369
[SPEAKER_02]: Paranoia.

03:06.869 --> 03:07.770
[SPEAKER_02]: Very excited about that.

03:07.990 --> 03:08.411
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

03:22.038 --> 03:25.101
[SPEAKER_02]: Dancing, also coming to Karaoke Revolution.

03:25.621 --> 03:30.245
[SPEAKER_02]: Karaoke Revolution Party, Xbox, GameCube, and PlayStation.

03:30.425 --> 03:31.166
[SPEAKER_02]: Going to be on all three.

03:31.366 --> 03:31.706
[SPEAKER_02]: All three.

03:31.926 --> 03:33.908
[SPEAKER_02]: It's dancing and singing, if you want.

03:33.928 --> 03:35.929
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to play, but kind of crazy.

03:36.009 --> 03:37.190
[SPEAKER_02]: All that stuff going on on the screen at once.

03:37.210 --> 03:41.254
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, what was really cool is, you've got to go back to Ultramix 3 here.

03:41.554 --> 03:42.915
[SPEAKER_03]: Quest mode, that was really strange.

03:43.395 --> 03:48.599
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually got cities that are actual cities throughout the United States.

03:48.619 --> 03:48.960
[SPEAKER_03]: You go and...

03:49.440 --> 03:52.082
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, what did you think of the music selections available at Konami?

04:06.341 --> 04:15.027
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually didn't hang around too long, but I tried to play Jelly Kiss, except my hip decided that, hey, you know, your Vicodin hasn't kicked in yet.

04:15.527 --> 04:19.970
[SPEAKER_04]: So I ended up having to stumble off of it, but I did play Beatmania.

04:21.371 --> 04:26.174
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever it was that I played was supposed to be a six star, and it was more like a one.

04:26.895 --> 04:30.477
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't think that they're completely up to level yet.

04:30.497 --> 04:32.078
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was only an E3 demo.

04:32.359 --> 04:35.721
[SPEAKER_04]: But I did wander around and check some of the peripherals out.

04:36.441 --> 04:39.142
[SPEAKER_04]: I tried the one at DDRgame.com.

04:39.942 --> 04:42.383
[SPEAKER_04]: And their metal pad's pretty decent, but there's a delay on it.

04:42.823 --> 04:43.323
[SPEAKER_04]: It's cushy.

04:43.964 --> 04:44.884
[SPEAKER_04]: I played Superstar.

04:44.964 --> 04:48.045
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, by then, my medicine had kicked in.

04:48.325 --> 04:51.726
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's a delay on it, I could tell, because Superstar's one of my old PA ones.

04:53.767 --> 04:54.467
[SPEAKER_04]: But it wasn't bad.

04:56.323 --> 04:57.003
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

05:18.621 --> 05:29.291
[SPEAKER_04]: I did talk to the rep there and he said, this is as close to a quote as I can come, he said they are going to continue to market it until there is something actually published in terms of a lawsuit.

05:30.643 --> 05:33.005
[SPEAKER_02]: For those curious about the lawsuit, it does not involve Red Octane.

05:33.366 --> 05:40.632
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've read the list that DDR Freak made available, the actual printouts of the suit, Red Octane was never mentioned in it.

05:40.672 --> 05:42.054
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're going ahead with this release.

05:42.114 --> 05:44.196
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's good for us in the end.

05:44.636 --> 05:48.260
[SPEAKER_03]: And we decided to ask them about their other games that have been posted.

05:48.740 --> 05:49.421
[SPEAKER_03]: Guitar Hero.

05:49.481 --> 05:50.382
[SPEAKER_03]: Guitar Hero.

05:51.683 --> 05:54.445
[SPEAKER_03]: And it sounds pretty cool so far.

05:54.506 --> 05:56.007
[SPEAKER_03]: They had to be very vague on it.

05:56.207 --> 05:59.269
[SPEAKER_02]: It is going to be 5-key guitar controls, which is very exciting.

06:20.735 --> 06:26.162
[SPEAKER_02]: DDR with Mario was shown not at Konami though, they showed it over at Nintendo.

06:27.764 --> 06:30.628
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of bare bones what I saw, I didn't get to see a whole lot of it.

06:30.648 --> 06:34.513
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to tell you what, I played a song on Very Hard and I triple-ate it my first try.

06:34.912 --> 06:35.973
[SPEAKER_02]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

06:56.913 --> 06:58.834
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you guys ever released a drum peripheral?

06:58.854 --> 07:01.495
[SPEAKER_03]: And he kind of smelled where I was going with that.

07:01.555 --> 07:07.717
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's like, I have to be very vague on that, but we're working on something.

07:07.737 --> 07:09.678
[SPEAKER_02]: You get a nice we'll see from that.

07:10.158 --> 07:10.418
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

07:10.738 --> 07:15.340
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, not everybody that listens to our show is into music games, so let's talk about some of the other things we saw at the show today.

07:15.400 --> 07:17.521
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe pick three highlights.

07:17.541 --> 07:18.982
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll go around and talk about three highlights.

07:19.022 --> 07:20.222
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura wants to start us off.

07:21.820 --> 07:25.984
[SPEAKER_04]: I spent a lot of time at Nintendo, so I played Animal Crossing DS.

07:26.484 --> 07:27.185
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots of fun.

07:27.965 --> 07:31.208
[SPEAKER_04]: The world itself is very spherical.

07:31.929 --> 07:35.151
[SPEAKER_04]: You actually feel like you're walking on a small little planet.

07:35.572 --> 07:39.094
[SPEAKER_02]: I was very impressed because Animal Crossing DS is not just a rehashed GameCube version.

07:39.134 --> 07:41.656
[SPEAKER_02]: They actually went back and redid all the graphics and the interface.

07:41.897 --> 07:46.000
[SPEAKER_02]: And at the show, you could play against someone who was sitting in New York City.

07:46.380 --> 07:48.242
[SPEAKER_02]: And I promised I would give a shout-out, but I forgot her name.

07:48.282 --> 07:48.822
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm very sorry.

07:48.842 --> 07:50.584
[SPEAKER_04]: I played against Charles.

07:51.284 --> 07:51.744
[SPEAKER_02]: The Voice of Mario.

07:51.764 --> 07:52.585
[SPEAKER_02]: The Voice of Mario.

07:52.605 --> 07:53.205
[SPEAKER_02]: Mario Kart.

07:53.665 --> 07:54.966
[SPEAKER_04]: And he called me a lovely lady.

07:55.286 --> 07:56.306
[SPEAKER_04]: He doesn't know me very well.

07:56.326 --> 07:57.047
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.

07:57.567 --> 07:59.388
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when I met him last year, I said, it's a you.

08:00.288 --> 08:01.869
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so Animal Crossing.

08:02.549 --> 08:03.329
[SPEAKER_04]: It was pretty fun.

08:03.409 --> 08:06.411
[SPEAKER_04]: I went around twirling my umbrella, which he said I was very good at.

08:06.751 --> 08:10.392
[SPEAKER_04]: And then he was going around whacking everybody else with the bug catching net.

08:11.033 --> 08:15.855
[SPEAKER_04]: And he kept chasing the person with the pirate hat because he said it's fun to hit the pirate with the net.

08:16.863 --> 08:23.969
[SPEAKER_04]: and then I played Pokemon DX, I'm sorry, XD, which actually, I played it just for the plushie.

08:25.049 --> 08:26.330
[SPEAKER_02]: XD, like the smiley face?

08:26.371 --> 08:39.501
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but it was actually pretty cool, it's a big ol' RPG, and you play against all the up-to-date Pokemon, you know, it's the typical stadium style battle, but it was really cool.

08:40.194 --> 08:41.955
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually enjoyed it.

08:42.355 --> 08:43.396
[SPEAKER_04]: I took a couple pictures.

08:43.876 --> 08:46.758
[SPEAKER_04]: I took pictures of just about everything I played except for the DS ones.

08:47.898 --> 08:51.020
[SPEAKER_04]: And actually, I played Nintendogs.

08:52.046 --> 09:21.609
[SPEAKER_04]: is a cute puppy, because you throw the frisbee, and then they sit on it, and they're stupid, and then you tap the screen, and they're like, oh, you want this, pat on the head, and then you grab it, and then, no, you can't, no, you threw this, you don't keep it anymore, I'm keeping it, says the puppy, no, no, no, no, you're going to give me, because I'm the human, no, says the puppy, I'm going to give, so you pull it out of the puppy, okay, throw it, puppy, and it's like three puppies, and so,

09:22.793 --> 09:24.793
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a beautiful description of Nintendogs, thank you.

09:26.094 --> 09:27.274
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder if they'll have them in tin cats.

09:28.454 --> 09:29.575
[SPEAKER_04]: I talked to the guy about it.

09:29.995 --> 09:31.955
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, you don't really train a cat.

09:31.975 --> 09:33.435
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, yeah, the cat trains you.

09:34.756 --> 09:35.856
[SPEAKER_04]: Human food now.

09:36.816 --> 09:38.617
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's your three for now, all Nintendo.

09:38.677 --> 09:39.097
[SPEAKER_02]: That's alright.

09:39.877 --> 09:44.098
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but one of the fun things was the picto-chatting with random people in the lines.

09:44.258 --> 09:44.698
[SPEAKER_04]: It was great.

09:45.660 --> 09:51.005
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, speaking of random things going on in the line, we were standing next to Gary Coleman this morning and didn't even realize it.

09:51.185 --> 09:52.606
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Hodeo Kojima walked by.

09:52.627 --> 09:53.287
[SPEAKER_02]: It was so weird.

09:54.068 --> 09:58.372
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I stood next to that chick from G4TV.com, the one that's blonde, spiky hair.

09:58.712 --> 10:00.574
[SPEAKER_03]: Granted, I hate her on TV, but she's still hot.

10:01.551 --> 10:03.112
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just an on-air thing.

10:03.132 --> 10:04.693
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure she's a nice gal.

10:04.753 --> 10:06.494
[SPEAKER_02]: She seemed nice when I saw her.

10:06.514 --> 10:07.575
[SPEAKER_03]: They're all nice, I'm sure.

10:08.716 --> 10:10.737
[SPEAKER_03]: Fear me, I am your all-knowing host.

10:10.757 --> 10:11.738
[SPEAKER_02]: They're paid to be weird.

10:11.818 --> 10:12.819
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why we're not on TV.

10:12.859 --> 10:14.900
[SPEAKER_02]: We're a little too not weird for TV.

10:15.120 --> 10:16.341
[SPEAKER_02]: No way, I'm not paid to be weird.

10:16.821 --> 10:17.662
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, anyway, anyway.

10:18.242 --> 10:19.883
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, your three highlights for today.

10:20.023 --> 10:20.304
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

10:20.864 --> 10:30.991
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it wouldn't be a show if I didn't start off with, I don't know, let's just start off with Advent Children, which in Square Enix's,

10:32.132 --> 10:34.153
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how they pronounce it, but it's wrong.

10:34.494 --> 10:35.314
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Squeenix.

10:35.474 --> 10:36.075
[SPEAKER_03]: We all know that.

10:36.515 --> 10:48.645
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, in their little rehashed movie thing that they did last year, they have new footage of Advent Children and... Latifah fighting in the cathedral.

10:49.606 --> 10:50.466
[SPEAKER_03]: Hot.

10:51.387 --> 10:52.268
[SPEAKER_03]: Freaking hot.

10:52.648 --> 10:58.293
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I know that stuff's going to be on GameSpot later, and I'm sure they're going to have a video for it.

10:58.653 --> 10:59.313
[SPEAKER_03]: Watch it.

11:00.474 --> 11:01.255
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, very hot.

11:01.555 --> 11:02.295
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, so they have that.

11:02.315 --> 11:02.855
[SPEAKER_03]: That was cool.

11:04.316 --> 11:12.741
[SPEAKER_03]: The second thing that I actually got to do, which was kind of neat, is I got to try out We Love Katamari, and that was a lot of fun.

11:13.470 --> 11:14.051
[SPEAKER_03]: I played that too!

11:14.071 --> 11:14.992
[SPEAKER_03]: I picked up the flowers.

11:15.032 --> 11:17.715
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it just Mirrors the King's Package even bigger?

11:32.483 --> 11:34.546
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, but it was pretty funny.

11:35.447 --> 11:39.092
[SPEAKER_03]: Then they had... What else did they play that was really cool?

11:39.773 --> 11:45.560
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, well, I got to try a little bit of... I can't remember what the title is.

11:45.580 --> 11:46.922
[SPEAKER_03]: I can only remember the subtitle.

11:47.042 --> 11:47.403
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like...

11:48.893 --> 11:54.335
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, um, something, something, something, uh, contents under pressure.

11:54.455 --> 11:58.416
[SPEAKER_03]: It's that, um, tagging game where you actually spray paint buildings and stuff.

11:58.676 --> 12:06.378
[SPEAKER_03]: I played that for a little bit, but it was weird because I was tagging stuff and all of a sudden, like, SWAT comes with guns and they start shooting at me.

12:06.418 --> 12:09.558
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, that's a little harsh for someone that's just tagging a building.

12:09.678 --> 12:10.819
[SPEAKER_04]: But Jet Set Radio does that.

12:11.219 --> 12:12.739
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's very similar.

12:12.779 --> 12:15.380
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, so I had to fight them off with a paint roller and guess what?

12:15.880 --> 12:16.261
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura

12:39.790 --> 12:43.112
[SPEAKER_04]: I did take a very up-close picture of one, so that'll be available soon.

12:43.132 --> 12:45.074
[SPEAKER_02]: As did I. I'm going to get to the mail.

12:45.174 --> 12:46.755
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have a question for us, hurry up.

12:46.795 --> 12:47.775
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to write us right now.

12:48.256 --> 12:53.579
[SPEAKER_02]: E3 at OrangeLoungeRadio.com And we'll be checking this box, such as these questions that came in from Sunday's show.

12:53.999 --> 12:55.080
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll answer these.

12:55.260 --> 12:58.943
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have something you want us to check into on the show, remember we can't get to everything.

12:59.003 --> 13:01.845
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you send us a big list, we'll probably only be able to get to one or two.

13:02.145 --> 13:03.346
[SPEAKER_02]: But we want to try and help you guys out.

13:03.426 --> 13:06.348
[SPEAKER_02]: Michael N. actually wanted more information on the Game Boy Micro.

13:06.448 --> 13:06.928
[SPEAKER_02]: What is it?

13:07.408 --> 13:10.271
[SPEAKER_02]: Game Boy Micro is like a Game Boy Advance, but it's the size of your palm.

13:10.491 --> 13:11.232
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very small.

13:11.272 --> 13:12.193
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the coolest thing about it.

13:12.213 --> 13:17.038
[SPEAKER_02]: You know how we usually bag on Nintendo because they make you buy the same thing five different times to get it in different colors?

13:17.338 --> 13:22.163
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the face is detachable, kind of like a car stereo, so you can actually change the face.

13:22.303 --> 13:26.647
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a red face and a blue face and a baseball-looking face and all these strange things.

13:26.747 --> 13:28.609
[SPEAKER_02]: Any other impressions on the Game Boy Micro, you guys?

13:29.736 --> 13:30.196
[SPEAKER_04]: It's little!

13:30.476 --> 13:33.578
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's supposed to also have, what, double the battery power, too.

13:34.499 --> 13:34.799
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

13:34.819 --> 13:37.300
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you can just keep it on indefinitely, maybe?

13:37.320 --> 13:38.661
[SPEAKER_03]: The screen's, like, half the size.

13:40.482 --> 13:44.664
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, the Game Boy Advance games, I don't think, are that good anymore.

13:44.704 --> 13:47.766
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, there's nothing really Game Boy Advance that I really want.

13:48.266 --> 13:53.469
[SPEAKER_03]: I noticed, though, it's slightly larger than, say, a Game Boy Advance cartridge.

13:53.890 --> 13:55.931
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, maybe a bit larger than that, but...

13:56.440 --> 13:58.482
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, it looks like a cell phone screen.

13:59.223 --> 14:03.266
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, and really... It does, it looks like playing it on a cell phone.

14:03.286 --> 14:08.852
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, it's like if I had a Game Boy Advance SP or original Game Boy Advance, I wouldn't really buy this.

14:09.012 --> 14:10.013
[SPEAKER_03]: It's cute though, it's cute.

14:10.033 --> 14:15.157
[SPEAKER_03]: It's cute, but it's like, really, I mean, Game Boy Advance SP, it pretty much fits in your pocket.

14:15.458 --> 14:18.961
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you really need, I mean, hell, a DS fits in my pocket, so...

14:19.841 --> 14:20.722
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, voice over IP chat.

14:40.976 --> 14:41.757
[SPEAKER_04]: There was that too.

14:42.498 --> 14:47.083
[SPEAKER_04]: Which actually, if anyone's ever seen the commercial, the Cisco commercials, where they have the U.S.

14:47.123 --> 14:50.246
[SPEAKER_04]: marketing team and the Japanese marketing team and they're playing, they put this phone back on there.

14:50.487 --> 14:51.568
[SPEAKER_04]: I used to use that phone at work.

14:51.968 --> 14:58.916
[SPEAKER_04]: It uses your internet line as your phone line, almost kind of like our Skype does, similarly, except it's carried over an internet signal.

15:00.539 --> 15:09.361
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, Jin sent us a really big list, and, um, I think actually it's Jin4576, I apologize if I screwed up your number, 4576 I think, but, uh, who cares, it's Jin, it's awesome.

15:09.681 --> 15:11.761
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, SoulCalibur3, create a character.

15:12.061 --> 15:18.042
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the demo was a little skimpy, we only saw Mitsuru Yugi versus one of the new characters, one with a giant chakra, I can't remember her name.

15:18.362 --> 15:24.303
[SPEAKER_02]: T, I'm really sorry guys, I don't cheat, I don't use papers, I've got, I think it was Tina or Tira, something.

15:24.603 --> 15:28.104
[SPEAKER_02]: They were the only two playable ones in the demo, didn't see a lot of created characters, sorry to say.

15:28.344 --> 15:29.624
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully we'll know more information on that soon.

15:30.224 --> 15:34.686
[SPEAKER_02]: One more information also on Final Fantasy XII, CG looks amazing.

15:34.786 --> 15:37.648
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they went back and retooled it because it looks like Advent Children.

15:38.828 --> 15:41.670
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that what they're going to be doing is release it for the PS3.

15:41.690 --> 15:43.291
[SPEAKER_03]: That's our thought.

15:43.351 --> 15:50.194
[SPEAKER_02]: That's our thought is that because they weren't showing playable versions of it, but we don't want to start rumors, but we think it almost looks too good to be on PS2.

15:51.395 --> 15:52.315
[SPEAKER_04]: Either that or it's dev kit.

15:54.005 --> 15:54.906
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

16:12.145 --> 16:13.968
[SPEAKER_02]: I also saw the classroom one which is pretty cool

16:27.368 --> 16:30.651
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, we do have to wrap things up pretty soon here, but any other thoughts?

16:30.671 --> 16:32.433
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to touch on one more thing Katamari-related.

16:32.793 --> 16:48.306
[SPEAKER_03]: We saw the giant Katamari that they had there, and it was funny because one of the things that someone had stuck on there is, I don't know if anyone's heard about this, for the Nintendo DS, they had, you know, touching is good thing, and you can actually send in to get your own, you know, mannequin hand.

16:48.526 --> 16:52.830
[SPEAKER_03]: And someone had put the mannequin hand on the large Katamari, and that was hilarious.

16:52.990 --> 16:57.112
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so if you guys have any other E3 questions, E3 at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

16:57.152 --> 16:59.012
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, before we go, just one other thing real quick.

16:59.072 --> 16:59.933
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, DarkSakura has a thought.

17:01.033 --> 17:05.995
[SPEAKER_04]: Xtango has more stuff in it and looks awesome, and they are in talks with developers this year.

17:07.170 --> 17:07.650
[SPEAKER_02]: I missed that.

17:07.690 --> 17:08.791
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope to check that one out tomorrow.

17:08.811 --> 17:10.211
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw it briefly as I walked past.

17:10.231 --> 17:11.591
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, ooh, Xtango's here.

17:12.312 --> 17:14.772
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't get to spend a lot of time on West Hall or Kenshi today.

17:14.792 --> 17:15.773
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hoping to spend more time there.

17:15.933 --> 17:20.694
[SPEAKER_02]: No, yeah, I know, and I missed it completely somehow.

17:20.854 --> 17:21.174
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

17:21.274 --> 17:29.817
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just want to go through the thing you were most looking forward to that maybe disappointed you a little bit, because I have something on the top of my mind, and that would be the Nintendo DS download station.

17:30.397 --> 17:36.760
[SPEAKER_02]: I was really looking forward to it, but it was hammered with people, and the rooms were full, and it was hard to get anything on there.

17:36.880 --> 17:40.881
[SPEAKER_02]: But I just went and sat down and used the DSs they had there.

17:41.482 --> 17:43.723
[SPEAKER_02]: And I did get to play Meteos, which was very cool.

17:43.883 --> 17:46.584
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sad I didn't get to hear the music, though, because I hear the music's very cool.

17:46.824 --> 17:49.285
[SPEAKER_02]: But the game itself, simple yet addicting.

17:50.245 --> 17:51.846
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking forward to playing this one in more detail.

17:52.246 --> 17:55.047
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys have any thoughts, things you were looking forward to that maybe disappointed you a little bit?

17:57.108 --> 17:59.169
[SPEAKER_04]: I went in with no expectations, and they were met.

18:00.427 --> 18:01.147
[SPEAKER_02]: Rockstar's Booth

18:25.781 --> 18:27.262
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, I'm very disappointed on swag.

18:27.282 --> 18:28.343
[SPEAKER_03]: Not a lot of swag this year.

18:28.363 --> 18:32.545
[SPEAKER_03]: I beg to differ, because I have Pokemon, and I have t-shirts, and I have press kits, and I have puppies.

18:51.644 --> 19:01.112
[SPEAKER_03]: and also big disappointment to Sony and Nintendo for constantly tripping the breakers there and causing power outages in their little hall there.

19:01.352 --> 19:04.815
[SPEAKER_02]: And also kind of a thumbs down to people wanting you to wait in line for their show.

19:04.915 --> 19:06.957
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's got a line and it's a half hour long.

19:07.077 --> 19:07.417
[SPEAKER_02]: Too bad.

19:08.109 --> 19:09.029
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

19:22.489 --> 19:23.650
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, we're going to wrap it up here.

19:24.050 --> 19:25.351
[SPEAKER_02]: Final thoughts, you guys.

19:25.391 --> 19:25.611
[SPEAKER_02]: Matt?

19:26.772 --> 19:35.838
[SPEAKER_03]: Tomorrow, I'm going to wait in line for Nintendo, and I'm waiting in line to see the PS3, and Xbox can suck it, because in order to play their game, you have to be media.

19:36.158 --> 19:39.200
[SPEAKER_03]: But you can look down upon it on a wonderful platform.

19:39.220 --> 19:40.061
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, to hell with them.

19:40.321 --> 19:40.681
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

19:40.901 --> 19:45.004
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not buying your stupid Xbox 360, so you can shove it, okay?

19:45.024 --> 19:46.445
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I ain't buying that crap.

19:46.505 --> 19:47.566
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care how good it looks.

19:47.586 --> 19:49.647
[SPEAKER_03]: Views and opinions expressed of Loki do not necessarily...

19:49.767 --> 19:51.688
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, also, the new console systems are ugly.

19:51.988 --> 19:53.209
[SPEAKER_03]: Except for the Xbox 360.

19:53.289 --> 19:54.290
[SPEAKER_03]: There's irony for ya.

19:55.030 --> 19:58.452
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, the Xbox 360 show that they did was freaking pretty.

19:58.812 --> 20:00.113
[SPEAKER_04]: Quake 4, ha ha ha ha.

20:00.373 --> 20:01.674
[SPEAKER_04]: Dead or Alive 4, ha ha ha.

20:02.174 --> 20:06.477
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, if I were a man, I would have walked around the whole rest of the con with a big boner the whole time.

20:07.237 --> 20:08.458
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm not.

20:09.458 --> 20:13.661
[SPEAKER_04]: But my final thought is, I'm kind of pissed off that they wouldn't let me put a Reject False Icon sticker on the Katamari.

20:15.142 --> 20:15.802
[SPEAKER_02]: Aw, that stinks.

20:16.611 --> 20:19.854
[SPEAKER_02]: My final thought is Sony and I are spending some quality time together tomorrow.

20:20.854 --> 20:21.175
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

20:21.575 --> 20:26.178
[SPEAKER_02]: From us here at E3 in LA live to you guys, thanks for tuning in and subscribing to our podcast.

20:26.198 --> 20:27.819

[SPEAKER_02]: Be sure to check out that photo gallery when we get back.

20:30.041 --> 20:30.581
[SPEAKER_02]: When we get back.

20:30.721 --> 20:33.183
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be back on, what, Sunday we'll have it up?

20:33.383 --> 20:33.643
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

20:33.743 --> 20:34.084
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

20:34.284 --> 20:34.544
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

20:34.984 --> 20:35.605
[SPEAKER_02]: Till next time, guys.

20:36.994 --> 20:40.596
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the end of another Orange Lounge Radio To Go edition.
