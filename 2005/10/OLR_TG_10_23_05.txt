Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, week of October 24th, 2005.
You're tuned in to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your podcast home for all the latest video game news and gamer chat.
Now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.
Hello, everybody out there in iTunes or iPod or whatever you're using to download our podcast, maybe one of those websites out there.
DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Yes, our webpage.
OrangeLaundry.com or the OLRPSP site?
OLRPSP.
The problem is I don't know how to program in said languages that I'm programming in.
And so, yeah, it's a little difficult.
It's kind of a learning experience.
You must be trying to cook up some cool stuff for the site.
Of course.
All right.
Sounds good.
Check that out.
OLRPSP.com.
It's our new site.
Just for the PSPs.
I mean, you can bring it up on like Internet Explorer or Firefox, but seriously, it's really made for your PSP.
It looks so much better on a PSP.
Like if you bring it up in Firefox, you're going to go, what the heck?
This doesn't look right.
But on a PSP, it looks great.
High def and everything.
It's awesome.
Yeah, we're working on something that's kind of with the theme of the normal station that is, you know...
Getting our listeners to basically give us feedback and just a whole way of connecting with our listeners.
Absolutely.
So actually, we also have the Orange Lounge Radio message line, which just opened up on our website for our live show.
So we might be using that in our podcast as well.
So it's more interactivity to make this a little bit your show as well, because we appreciate you guys tuning in and taking the time to listen.
So it's just Loki and I tonight.
Nobody else wanted to come.
Nobody else wanted to be on the podcast.
No, it's cool.
We got a little bit of news to talk about tonight.
But first, we always talk about how our gaming week was, what we've been playing, and what's new in our gaming world.
Because you know what?
We're geeks too.
Loki, what have you been playing?
I have been playing a couple things.
First, I started off with Burnout because I had to get the rest of Burnout out of my system.
And then I've got my new baby, and that would be The Warriors.
The Warriors?
I've never even heard of this.
What's this about?
The Warriors is a game based on the 1979 movie starring Michael Beck.
It's basically about the gangs of New York.
Not like the Martin Scorsese gangs in New York?
No, no, no.
This is about gangs during 1979.
Okay.
Think really cheesy themed gangs like you have a gang called the Baseball Furies that are dressed up like baseball players.
You have a gang of like mime looking people.
When you're a jet, you know you're a jet.
Seriously, it's like that.
It's very similar to that, but it's just so cheesy and cool.
The game is really awesome.
It's kind of like a Final Fight type game where you just beat up everything, but they actually have a story to it.
It actually takes place three months before the events of the movie, then the very end of the game goes through the events of the movie, because basically the story of the movie is that
There's this one guy who's calling all these gangs together to unite them because they outnumber the police and are basically going to take over New York.
Well, this other gang frames the warriors and they kill the guy, and so now everybody's out to kill you, and so you have to get back to your home turf of Coney Island before you get beaten to death.
Xbox Live on Xbox?
No.
Oh, bummer.
Yeah, but it's really awesome.
and then this next week in a few days here I'll be picking up Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories.
That's coming out very soon.
Which I'm very excited about that one.
Speaking of Xbox, did you know Xbox Live is going to be, I know not that you care because you don't really play Xbox Live, right?
I don't have an Xbox.
Oh, I thought you got one finally.
Okay, but you're going to be getting a 360, right?
Yeah.
So are you going to buy any old Xbox games to kind of catch up on what you missed?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and so I guess you know I was kind of trying to look into and during our three hour show earlier this week we were kind of talking to some of our listeners trying to get feedback on how the new Xbox 360 what their thoughts are on it and it sounds like you're going to be actually able to change your gamer tag whenever you want on the new 360 it's tied to your passport you know the whole Microsoft passport thing they're integrating that into the 360 it sounds like so that's kind of what we're hearing well that's cool at least in that way you can have a gamer tag you know that other people might have and
I don't know.
That'd be interesting.
Well, maybe.
I mean, I don't know if we can duplicate names still, but... As long as I can keep my old one, I guess that's okay.
Yeah.
I don't know.
Even though I don't... There's better names I would have liked, but oh well.
Anyway, anything else you've been playing in your game week?
Really?
No.
I've been just trying to play some of... I'm trying to... I have Shadow of Colossus, but I haven't gotten a chance to play it yet.
And so I want to check that one out and maybe Tony Hawk's American Wasteland.
But I haven't gotten a chance to play him yet.
Real life?
Yeah, real life and just web page crap.
All right, all right.
My gaming week actually has been pretty mellow.
It's been mostly World of Warcraft, which I talked about on last week's show.
I went out and got it, and it was this big, oh, Rob got World of Warcraft.
But I've been playing it, and I've been giving it a fair chance and kind of checking it out, seeing what I think of it.
And you know, I actually kind of like it.
It's a lot better than I thought it would be, because you know, remember guys, I played Final Fantasy XI for like two years, so of course I hear nothing but smack talking about World of Warcraft, but one thing I'm learning about
The MMOs as I'm playing World of Warcraft is, it really is just a much different game than Final Fantasy XI.
It's very different and it has a whole lot of different things to offer and it's not necessarily better or worse.
It's just that even though World of Warcraft and Final Fantasy XI and let's take some of the other big ones too, Guild Wars and Ragnarok.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
because Guild Wars is practically set up so that you don't even have to ever play with anybody.
And you don't play a monthly fee with Guild Wars.
Not that I think Guild Wars is necessarily the strongest game, nor is it my favorite out of the three, but I think it's probably the most accessible and most non-shocking.
The game is kind of set up very similar to a single-player experience, if you want it to be.
But as far as Final Fantasy XI and World of Warcraft, I'm just noticing...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Like, if you're looking for a game that you want to do, like, some, you know, role-playing, or you just want to, you know, do quests and big things with friends and stuff, I think Final Fantasy is probably the more social game.
But World of Warcraft has its own strengths as well.
I think there's a lot of things that make World of Warcraft a little less tedious of a game to be playing sometimes, because seriously, Final Fantasy XI feels like a second job sometimes.
It can get that intricate, and World of Warcraft doesn't feel that way at all.
World of Warcraft is a little more, you know, relaxed.
So I'm just kind of learning about all the differences between the game, but I think all in all,
I like World of Warcraft and I would recommend it if you are I mean obviously probably most of you guys already have it I'm really a late bloomer when it comes to this game just because I've been focused on one MMO for so long um
But if you have an interest in the game and you think it sounds like something you'd like, check it out.
I think you'll find it's really different than the other MMOs out there, except for Guild Wars.
Because Guild Wars and World of Warcraft have a lot in common.
They really do.
Just in the game, the way it plays.
To me, it feels very similar.
I think World of Warcraft has a lot more than Guild Wars.
About 40 more levels, for one.
And more crafting and stuff you can do that I think makes it a little more...
A little longer gameplay than Guild Wars would be.
Still haven't played Final Fantasy yet, again.
Still waiting for that time to come in, but it's not there.
I think I'm just on a cool-off period from Final Fantasy XI for a little while myself.
I need to just take a step back.
I'm not saying I dislike the game at all, I still think it's an awesome game, and I love it a lot, and I'll probably get back into it once the 360 and Treasures of Adorgan expansions kind of,
I don't
No, if it is.
I'm not sure if it is.
Well, you know, I heard it's not going to support the voice chat, because the voice chat's going to be unmoderated, which doesn't make sense to me, because... Oh, I wouldn't want voice chat anyways.
Imagine Final Fantasy XI voice chat.
I've done it.
TeamSpeak.
Or Ventrilo, or one of those things.
Yeah, but, okay.
That works fine when you have a group of people, but what if you have the world?
No, thank you.
Okay, I gotcha.
But, no, the whole thing is...
I just hope it's supported, period, because then that way I can cancel my PlayOnLive account and just move it all over to the Xbox Live.
I have this feeling it's going to be set up like PSO where you have to pay for both, and that's going to be sad.
Because with Phantasy Star Online on Xbox, you have to pay not just the Xbox Live, but then you pay the Sega fee of like $8 as well.
Sucks.
Well, still, they're going to have a break, I'm sure.
Yeah, we'll see.
I hope so, I hope so.
All right, let's get into some gaming news tonight, talk about some things going on in the gaming world.
Speaking of the Xbox 360, Walmart and EB Games and some other stores are starting to get the little Xbox 360 kiosks.
I haven't seen any show up, but there's some websites set up that you can just go on to some of the major gaming portals.
You can probably find some websites.
that have these lists set up of where all these gaming kiosks are.
They have lists.
They even have a Google Map thing that's set up for it.
But honestly, chances are it's going to be in the mall near you at some point.
Let me put it this way.
They're going to be rolled out to almost every store in over three weeks.
I mean, they're shipping them out right now.
Yeah, obviously Microsoft's pushing this thing like crazy.
It's going to be in your local store soon enough.
But if you just have to be first, get on the Internet and look.
I checked our local Walmart today because I just happened to be there, and no, they didn't have them.
I'm not a big Walmart fan myself.
I'm more of a Target guy, so... Yeah, it's only a couple demos, and honestly, this is coming out in a few weeks anyways.
I can wait.
I know, I know.
That's kind of where I'm at, too.
I'm like, you know what?
I'll just wait and have my own, and then I'll have to stand in line, and I'll have little kids looking over my shoulder.
That's what really annoys me, when little kids are looking over my shoulder, like if I am in a place like Walmart or Target playing one of those, and the little kids are looking over my shoulder.
What are you doing?
How do you do that?
How do you do that?
What do you do that?
How do you do that?
How do you do that?
What's that?
What's that?
Are you going to get this?
Are you going to buy this?
Sure, I might buy this.
Not that it's going to do you a damn bit of good, but kids are funny.
Let's go to another system.
Let's talk a little bit about the PSP, which has shipped 10 million units.
That's what officials from Sony are announcing, that they have reached 10 million units, of course, this being worldwide.
183 PSP software titles currently out, a total of 19.6 million units of software shipped, and then 15 million UMD movies.
That's kind of crazy, because that means almost just as many UMD movies have shipped as games.
And you know what's also crazy about it?
If 10 million...
PSPs have shipped, then that means like most people only own like one game.
And probably it's Luminous.
Probably one or two games.
It's probably Luminous.
It's one of them.
Well, I don't know.
Everybody I know, it's Luminous.
And honestly, it is the best PSP game out there.
I'm probably just not impressed with the games though right now like I am.
I mean, it's just... I haven't bought it.
I had...
I don't even remember the last PSP game I bought, other than Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories.
Everything I've gotten has been passed down free from publishers, and I wouldn't have even bought them if they hadn't given it to me, because I'm just unimpressed by everything that's coming out.
There just hasn't really been a title that's been like, I have to really get that.
And I'm kind of seeing that in the new Katamari PSP.
I'm like, oh, I definitely want to get that, because I'm in the Katamari franchise.
I'm into that.
But we have yet to see a really solid franchise game hit the PSP.
I mean, granted, we've had Burnout and
We've had Wipeout, I guess, and we've had Metal Gear, but not really the same Metal Gear.
We've had some extent the franchises, but we've really just had no solid franchise title hit the PSP.
You know what I mean?
I think that's kind of what's hurting it.
Whereas on the DS, now you're getting Castlevania, and it's seriously probably the best Castlevania game they've done since Symphony of the Night.
So, you know, it's like DS is starting to look really good with the franchises.
Mario Kart?
Yeah, Mario Kart on the way, and Animal Crossing.
The whole internet connectivity stuff.
So, PSP needs to pick up the pace.
We'll see what happens.
I know PSP's got its loyalists out there, though.
If you have any emails, comments, or suggestions, you know I send us an email to go at orangelaunchradio.com.
Maybe you're a PSP lover wanting to yell at us a little bit.
I don't dislike the PSP.
I think the PSP's a great multi-system, like getting to watch them.
And, you know, that's really what their marketing is.
So, on that end, it's successful that you can watch movies.
I'm not talking about PSP, either.
I mean, I've got two of them.
So, I mean, obviously, I love them, but just...
I love the fact that it's got the wireless internet now and you can download our show on it so it's great for that but the games element alone little weak it's just you know when you see a game like Twisted Metal you're thinking ooh Twisted Metal Black that was an awesome game oh wait this is a port of Twisted Metal 2 a Playstation game oh crap Twisted Metal for the PS3 I know there's gonna be one that's gonna be awesome
But anyway, about the email box, DarkSakura is our mailbox queen, but she's not here tonight, unfortunately, so we're going to go ahead and table mailbox until next week.
But definitely get your emails in to go at orange launch radio dot com.
I was talking a little bit about World of Warcraft earlier, and you know there's an expansion on the horizon, and of course people love to gossip about the expansion packs.
Here's the latest rumors circulating around the internet.
We don't know how true they are, but they seem to be pretty solid leads.
The Burning Crusade, sounds like it's going to be the name of it, and it's going to take place in the Outlands.
They're going to raise the level cap with this expansion to 70.
Some sites are saying 75, but most are saying 70.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Maybe next year, because I'm just now getting into World of Warcraft, so maybe next year I'll be ready for BlizzCon.
Anyway, they might do some small upgrades to the graphic engine as well, and they're going to add weather effects, which I think is neat.
And then the other thing I think is neat, cross-server battlegrounds.
So we'll see.
Well, I actually, I was reading, because I was reading an article about this earlier, and they were talking about some of the stuff that they're going to be having, and I could have sworn they actually did name the... Yeah, for Alliance, it's this...
Tra-nai or something like that.
It's D-R-A-E-N-E-I is the race for the alliance.
They have a new class, I guess, Spellbreaker.
They're rumored saying it's going to be race 275.
Six new areas and nine new high-end instances.
So it really just depends on what website you're looking at because everybody's reporting something different at this point.
But it seems like, okay, there's going to be a level cap raise.
Some little things it looks like.
Oh, yeah.
But...
You know the other big rumor going around about World of Warcraft right now is that it's going to go on the 360.
I'm certain Microsoft is really, really hoping for that, because let's face it, World of Warcraft right now is a PC-only title, and not everybody who's into consoles is into PC.
I like both.
In fact, with Civilization IV coming out this week, this is going to be a big month for PC gaming for me.
But, you know, there's folks that don't really cross those lines.
They're a PC gamer or they're a console gamer.
So if World of Warcraft came out on the 360 or any next-gen console, really, that would be huge.
I'd like to see it happen.
I think it would be good news, but who knows.
So surely you've been following the drama, and I'm sure anybody who listens to this show probably has been following this too, so I don't want to beat a dead horse with this.
Penny Arcade vs. Jack Thompson
Penny Arcade donated $10,000 because Jack Thompson was like, ha ha, just kidding about the mod thing.
He said he was going to give $10,000 to whoever did it and then he said it was a joke.
And Penny Arcade put up the $10,000 because Jack Thompson wouldn't do it.
And then Jack Thompson basically wrote a letter to the police saying that the Penny Arcade people are harassing him.
And then the Penny Arcade people filed something with a legal association to get Jack Thompson investigated.
No, what they were doing is they were actually, they sent a letter.
I'm completely paraphrasing here.
They sent letters to the Florida bar, basically.
So Jack Thompson now turns around and files a complaint with the feds and the district attorney, and the rumor is he was calling for a truce.
Well, yeah, he's all over the place, and he's emailing the feds and stuff like this, and all his information, I mean, if anybody actually instead of, because anybody's going to do research on this and be like, oh, my God, you know.
He's completely nuts because everything he's stating is completely wrong.
So, I mean, anybody who does any research on this and doesn't take him for, you know, face value is obviously going to see... He's good at getting publicity, though, because even we're talking about him.
Maybe we shouldn't be, I don't know.
No, it's just, we've got to point out that he's stupid.
That's what I like doing.
You've got to point out the retarded people.
I hate to say this.
There seems to be a lot of politicians coming from Florida that are just retarded.
Well, let's not go there because we don't want to get more hate mail from our friends in Florida.
Politicians!
I don't know, just politicians.
Florida's cool.
So anyway, if I could offer words of advice to Penny Arcade, finish him.
Just honestly...
Just let him dig himself his own grave.
I mean, because it's going to happen.
He's just going to eventually get caught up in so many lies.
You know, he'll be over.
I have just a small little story on Civilization 4.
It's coming out this week, October 25th.
And I want to buy this and check it out.
You know, I didn't... I loved Civilization 1.
Loved Civilization 1.
I know I've gone off on a previous podcast about how I think it's probably one of my favorite games of all time, if not my favorite game of all time, is Civilization 1.
But I never really got into 2 or 3.
It just didn't...
have that simpleness, that accessibility of Civilization 1.
But Civ 4 is on the horizon, and I'm just excited to at least check it out and see if I like it.
And I hear it's going to be really customizable and all this stuff, so it's coming out this week, and I'm curious about it.
I definitely... I wish I could rent PC games or something, because I don't want to have to spend $49.99 on it, but it looks like I'm going to have to, so we'll see.
I know, I'm like... Oh well, we'll see.
Anyway, Loki, what do you have for us tonight?
You got some news stories for us?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
I don't understand the lure of buying games before the system is out anyway.
Oh, I'm going to go home and look at the pretty packaging in the book.
Is it just to make the lines go faster when the system comes out?
I don't know.
I don't get it.
I think so.
Or just so there's not a huge rush on everything.
I'm getting my games before they come out just because...
Just pick everything up when I get it.
And then I'll have the system.
And you guys know I didn't reserve my system.
So I'm going to be playing the Rush the Crowds game.
I did it with the DS and I did it with other systems in the past.
I'll do it with the Xbox 360 as well.
The whole rumor is that they've been playing up the fact that they're oversold on it.
Big shock!
Every company says they're oversold when their systems come out.
They're saying that that was artificial to increase demand on the system or something like that.
But
What was that countdown thing you were blogging about earlier this week?
There was a countdown on the Xbox 360?
Hex 168.
Yeah, you talked about it last podcast.
Hex 168 is actually this kind of, it's almost like the origin site for the people in the U.S.
The thing is, though, you can win an Xbox system, the three Microsoft games, Project Gotham Racing, Cameo, and Perfect Dark, you can win that and a year of Xbox Live.
Um, what you have to do, though, is you have to create a short video clip or, um, like a Photoshop of the Hex 168 logo, um, like you saw it somewhere.
You know, like, you have to send them pictures.
So you have to get creative, you know, doing something like, you know, in California they have the lottery, you know, the mega lottery or whatever it is, and they have, you know, the
It looks like a home video camera footage of this giant ticket flying through the air.
No, something like that, you know, you have to make.
So it's like way too much.
So basically, the UK people, they get to just sign up and enter the drawing, but no, we have to actually work for it.
I kind of want to say the hand thing with the DS.
Yeah, it's like that.
They'd mail you a hand if you take a picture for touching as good.
I don't know, it kind of reminds me of that.
It's just another thing, the giveaway, more 360s.
And the win, I guess, you win a
A trip to the pre-release party or something like that.
Eh, not bad.
But, eh.
That's what I had to say.
Eh, I haven't paid for it.
Don't care.
Alright.
Um, I want to mention this.
We'll go back to Loki for some more stories.
You have more stories?
Yeah, I'm sure I do.
Alright, let me get this out first.
I want to mention this.
Even though it's not necessarily gaming specific...
The Senate Commerce Committee made a bill this week that says that in 2009 all transmissions will have to be digital television transmissions.
So it looks like HD is going to be the big thing in 2009 at the latest.
Of course they will be also doing the subsidization or something in the amount of $3 billion.
DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
But think about this, if your console life is five years, which it seems like most consoles have been lasting about five years on the market, that means that these consoles will need to be ready for this in 2009.
And it sounds like the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360 are both HD ready, but is Nintendo listening to this?
I hope so, because they said the revolution wouldn't support HDTV.
That makes me sad, so I hope they will reconsider in light of this bill.
Because by the end of the console life of the revolution, they're going to be in trouble.
But I don't think they're going to be in trouble.
They won't necessarily be in trouble, but they won't be as cool.
I think we still haven't heard everything about the revolution yet.
Yeah, I know.
I know there's still a lot to come, but the whole HD thing still... I want somebody to come out and say Nintendo Revolution will support HDTV, and then I'll shut my mouth.
You know I'm going to buy it no matter what because I'm going to want to play whatever Zelda game and whatever Metroid game and whatever Mario game they put out on it because I'm a consumer whore like that.
I know.
Yeah.
Alright, what else you got?
I got this funny site.
I was just looking up here.
This Chinese site actually was spoofing Nintendogs and they have Nintendogs.
It says college girls and friends.
So
I went and pulled it up and... Do you take the girls out for a walk and you have to clean up their poop?
Not quite.
It looks like a dating sim type thing.
I think this is actually all Photoshopped.
Oh god, it sprung too!
But it's a funny idea.
However, they're never going to go in that market because they're too family friendly.
Somebody was very, very bored, apparently.
Very bored and very horny, I guess.
Whoever made Nintendo Girls, go outside.
Seriously.
We don't have an advice column tonight because DarkSakura's not here, but that's my advice.
If this is you, go outside, please.
Seriously.
Get some fresh air.
The other thing is, Famitsu Magazine put up some pictures of Final Fantasy XII.
Which we will be referring to from now on as the sexy Final Fantasy XII.
Just kidding.
Okay.
You have to admit, the screenshots are sexy.
They are pretty sexy, but to me it looks like console version of XI, to be honest.
I mean, it's
Did you play the demo at E3 a couple years ago when they were actually demoing it?
I mean, lord knows what's changed in the past two years, but the battle system felt like a fusion of Final Fantasy XI and the old school Final Fantasies, but I don't know, in the past couple years they might have changed that.
I don't know.
It's hard to tell anymore.
They'll probably show it next year, too.
It's gonna be like the new Halo 2 of E3.
They'll show it like three years in a row without the damn game coming out.
Well, you know, I mean, and
Dragon Quest VIII is coming around the corner here pretty soon.
You're not supposed to have that demo back there.
Yes, it is.
So, that'll be something to check out.
Except I have my whole qualms with Dragon Quest VIII looking exactly like Dragon Ball Z. Granted, I know it's the same artist, but come on.
It looks exactly the same.
It's just, no.
It's like Dragon Ball Z. It even has Dragon in the name.
I mean, that's, it's wrong.
It's very wrong.
I was looking at a story very briefly.
It talks about Japan reconsidering the game ratings.
They may adopt some stricter standards for 18-plus games.
I wonder if that's a paranoia over in this country starting to set in over there.
There was basically like an event that happened.
It was like a gathering of top industry players, and they had a session, and the topic was video games and their effects on the youth.
And in a proposal by government representatives, which was kind of similar to what was going on here,
They put forward an initiative that said that there would be a distinct indication of games' contents on the packaging to change the CERO 18 rating to something that is recommended for 18 and over to prohibited for under 18.
So then they came out and these companies got together and it sounds like Square Enix president Yoichi Wada said,
actually told the group that there was still a need for more studies to be done on the game's influence of children.
So, kind of almost the same battle that's going on over here is going on in Japan right now.
Very interesting.
One more thing I was going to mention here.
Gizmondo launched in the US, apparently.
Oh, that's right.
And the reviews for it have been... I've heard some pretty negative reviews.
Pretty bad.
Yeah, I've heard that it's getting some negative reviews.
E3, SSX3, FIFA 2005, Sticky Balls
Which whatever the hell that is Doesn't sound like something I want to be walking to the counter with The other bad things about the Gizmondo When you turn it on it takes 40 seconds to boot The other thing is In order to turn it off you have to actually go through this menu Almost like Windows and you have to hit shut down The other thing though is it's available in two versions One for $2.29 which is being sold right now And then you have the premium version which is selling for $3.39
The 229 version, you get ads sent to your Gizmondo.
And in order to shut off your Gizmondo, you have to watch the three ads each day.
And for the 339 version, you don't get ads.
Is that a... That's the truth?
That's a real truth about the system?
One of the reviews said that.
If that is for real, then this... Yeah, I'm lost for words.
It seemed like an interesting idea at E3 and has quickly become... If that is true, I may proclaim this thing the worst gaming system of the past several years.
I don't know.
There's another system out there that really does want that title.
What's that?
The Phantom?
The N-Gage.
Oh, shit, yeah.
That's a tough call.
I'm afraid to say even with the 40 second load... The N-Gage won't freaking show you ads when you shut it down, though.
It's funny, though.
They said that one way you could bypass those is pull out the batteries, but, you know.
That's so stupid.
Why did you pay $339 for the system anyways?
I could have this really crappy handheld system, or, I don't know, I could get a 360, get a PSP, get any other system out there on the market.
Nice knowing you, Gizmondo.
Nice knowing you.
Follow-up to something we were talking about last week.
Children of Mana on the DS.
Of course, Famitsu Magazine.
Once again, spilling the beans on what's going on with Children of Mana.
It's, you know, going to be a very...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
And depending on the character that you're doing, you will be able to do different actions with your weapon.
So if you play as Frick, you can block incoming attacks with a guard and you can cut grass and stuff.
And then Pop, the character, has a flail, but it has a really large attack range and can do a boomerang thing and get long distance items.
And then there's another character, Tumble, and you can stun enemies from a long range with arrows.
And there's also going to be a fever gauge that will build up as you attack enemies.
When it's full, you do a super attack that's unique for each weapon.
Why they're calling it a fever gauge and not a limit break, which it just sounds the same damn thing as, I'm not sure.
Whatever.
That's cool.
Sounds like it'll be pretty cool.
I'll definitely want to check that out.
And you know we love to talk about video games that are being made into movies.
Oh yeah, usually most of them.
Did you go see Doom this weekend?
Not yet.
I have plans to go see it no matter how bad it is.
I will not probably see this.
I like Doom.
I respect Doom.
It's a series.
I like Doom 3.
I thought it was cool.
It's a popcorn movie.
Didn't need the movie.
Didn't need the movie.
It's a popcorn movie.
It's a poisoned popcorn movie.
People are looking for some great acting stuff.
You're not going to find it in video game movies until some other actual...
Well-directed ones come out.
I understand that, but even like... I don't know, even like Mortal Kombat had a halfway decent story, I suppose.
I just don't... I really don't... And Christopher Lambert was... I really don't understand how you can't make a good video game movie.
It's not that different.
You're just... Instead of taking the source materials from a book, a play, or something like that, you're taking it from a game.
Big deal.
I mean...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Well, it's just, they didn't go like all pixelated.
They didn't stomp on Goombas and stuff.
Exactly.
It's not retarded like that.
But, of course, you know, Super Mario Bros.
the movie came out when they were making these really strange sci-fi movies, you know, like Waterworld and, you know, Judge Dredd and stuff.
Right.
That was a whole other trend, but whatever.
I still have high hopes for Silent Hill.
You know, there's like one little publicity photo out right now, which tells you nothing about the movie, but...
House of the Dead
Dungeon Siege
by Microsoft.
I'm a fan of Swordfish, though.
That movie basically said, I'm going to kick your ass in the very beginning of the movie, and it did that.
It was awesome.
I saw like half of it.
It was a great movie.
I fell asleep.
The whole movie was just the villain winning, and that was the best part of the whole movie.
Alright.
No more stories from you, Loki?
Well, I got a couple things about the PSP.
Sure, what's up?
The first being that there's a game coming out.
It's supposed to be released, I believe, in December.
DJ Maxx.
It's a
Beep Mania
Out on the website now.
They're also on PSP Updates, which is pretty cool.
The other thing for music gaming fans is this game called Button Mashing Revolution.
That's when you play DDR on a controller.
Yeah, DDR on a controller.
They have it for PSP.
You can go download it on PSPUpdates.com as well.
Another interesting thing I saw is they have a Pac-Man race.
Wait, wait, does it have Butterfly?
I don't know.
Pac-Man World Rally Crash Bandicoot Racing
Thank you for watching!
My Faith in the Crash Bandicoot series went out the door.
You want to hear what they did for this one?
They made it a platform game and a racing game.
So you can get out of your car and do platform stuff.
I'm like, but it's a racing game.
Wouldn't you lose the race if you got out of your car to lay spikes down maybe or something?
I forget.
It's dumb.
Alright, sorry.
Batman World.
Pac-Man World Race, uh, World Rally, um... Wait, wait, wait, I said... Wait, this is weird, because isn't there that Mario Kart arcade game coming out?
Yeah.
And aren't there supposed to be Namco characters in that game?
Yeah, there are.
Because Namco's a part of that whole Triforce thing that did the F-Zero game?
Uh, there is.
So that's weird, because...
If this is coming out to compete with Mario Kart...
The other thing that they ported was Quake 2 this week.
They've done a new port of that, and that's pretty awesome.
But I'm not a huge Quake fan, so... I'm going to check it out.
I like Quake.
But Quake 2, I mean... I like the first Quake, though.
I'm still a purist with the first Quake.
Yeah, well, they have Quake 2, or Quake 1 available right now, and that's pretty awesome.
And, you know, Quake 2 is just going to be even more awesome.
Not necessarily.
I kind of skipped over Quake 2.
I played a lot of Quake 1, played a lot of Quake 3, didn't play a lot of Quake 2.
I don't know.
I'm just weird like that.
Last story of the night, guys.
Hideo Kojima has a blog out there, and it's been out there for a little while on the Kojima Productions website, but now it's in English, so you can kind of check out some of the things he talks about in his blog.
What's kind of interesting, he doesn't just talk about games.
I mean, he talked about directing Metal Gear Solid 4, and he's talked about some personal things, but he talks about kind of random things as well.
I thought this was an interesting quote, what he said about Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, the movie.
Interesting quote.
Yeah.
I know I aspire to be Veruca Salt.
I don't know about you, but...
Forget it.
Alright.
Finally, the last thing I've got.
SQ Stare.
You might remember him.
He's the guy that's working on hacking the Wi-Fi in the DS.
He's closing in on the bounty, which stands right now at $2,694.15.
But he's pretty much almost 100% done with everything.
Just a few more things to work on, but
Pretty soon they're going to be hacking that, and God knows what that's going to bring.
But I hear some pretty cool things are going to be coming out for the DS and the Revolution.
I know they're talking about a new Mario Paint.
Cool.
Oh, like a Mario Paint with a Revolution would be cool.
Mario Paint Revolution, and imagine Wi-Fi with the DS.
Be able to post your pictures.
PictoChat on HD.
PictoChat online, yeah.
That's beautiful.
So we'll have to look forward to that.
Okay, sounds good.
All right, final thoughts.
Your final thought.
I'm going to have to try maybe picking up Metroid Pinball this week because I want to see about that Rumble Pack thing.
That might be interesting.
Oh man, too many games to buy.
My final thought is there's too many games to buy.
We're getting in that month now where I'm going to be broke.
Oh wait, the Christmas season now.
I'm going to die.
Wait until November.
November is like 50 billion games.
I'm going to die.
It's going to be a fun month for us though with this show.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Rush to Rock, Rush 2049
Prapa the Rappa and DDR and in DDR there's been a musician in several of the Dance Dance Revolution games who anybody who's really into the Dance Dance Revolution games knows and really respects and that's Captain Jack Captain Jack passed away this week at the age of 43 of a stroke
and DarkSakura.
It was not going to be critically acclaimed.
It was just about fun and getting stuck in your head with those little march songs.
And, you know, that's what DDR is all about.
Because a lot of people, when they get into DDR, they go play it and then they run home and they burn a CD of all the DDR songs and listen to it in their car and show all their friends and stuff.
And Captain Jack's just a part of that.
and the dance game community and really the music community as a whole lost somebody really awesome this week so we wanted to dedicate tonight's episode to Captain Jack and although we don't normally play music on the podcast we felt tonight it would be appropriate to play a little clip of you guys of Captain Jack with Together and Forever so we're going to close out with this tonight have a great week and we'll see you next week
That's the end of another Orange Lounge Radio To Go edition.
This podcast is a proud part of www.orangeloungeradio.com.
See you next update.
