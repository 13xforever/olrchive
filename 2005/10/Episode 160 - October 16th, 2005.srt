1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,000
On tonight's program, ladies and gentlemen, we're gonna have a follow-up. We're gonna talk a lot about a follow-up to something we did last week.

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Talking about Orange Lounge Radio jumping the shark. For reals, yo.

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
We didn't jump the shark as much as we landed on it.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
You didn't jump the shark as much as I thought you were gonna.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Well Todd, it's going to all make sense tonight. We're going to finally reveal what happened this week, and why you guys are going to really get a kick out of this.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Also on this show, the Ferret comes out of the closet.

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Yes, and the Ferret is getting his own show on Logo. Go figure.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Also, I have a secret, and I'm going to tell you my secret. My secret is that I'm gay. No, I'm kidding. We have a real secret.

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
No! I would have never guessed!

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
All this and more when we come back, so get ready.

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Orange Lounge Radio is presented in the TMI Sound Format.

12
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:59,000
a

13
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Come on!

14
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Oh God!

15
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Heh heh heh heh!

16
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,200
Call me Daddy.

17
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:12,220
Orange Lounge may contain adult content.

18
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:16,820
Orange Lounge may contain many four letter words.

19
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:20,400
Orange Lounge may contain a scene of beauty.

20
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,440
Orange Lounge may contain plenty of-

21
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,440
B-B-B-B-B-B-Cocky?

22
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:27,040
Just kidding!

23
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,040
And Orange Lounge Radio will not contain any of that in this episode.

24
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,040
Well isn't that special!

25
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:48,040
Orange Lounge Radio Live is a fully interactive program via our website at www.orangeloungeradio.com

26
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:56,040
And now, here are your hosts for Orange Lounge Radio Live, Dark Sakura, Sky, and Loki.

27
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:06,040
We are live, and this is episode number 160 for this October 16, 2005.

28
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:11,040
You're tuned in to Orange Lounge Radio, radio the gamers really want.

29
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,040
We give you what you want, what you really, really want.

30
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:18,520
And this is Orange Lounge Radio Live, your home for all the news and discussion on rhythm

31
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:23,080
and music games, as well as the gamer community and the pop culture world.

32
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:28,880
We're plugged in and fully interactive through our website at www.orangeloungeradio.com.

33
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,880
My name is Rob Roberts.

34
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:33,480
You might know me as Sky, or you might know me as That Guy.

35
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:37,360
Hey, you guys!

36
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,360
Stop distracting me.

37
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:41,640
Joining me, as always, are my awesome co-hosts.

38
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,640
Sometimes I wish we were a TV show.

39
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,640
Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts. Say hello to Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

40
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,640
I don't know why you're talking about all this live crap, because I feel half-dead.

41
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:57,640
We're actually reanimated tonight. We're not really alive yet.

42
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:01,640
In honor of Land of the Dead being released to DVD.

43
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:06,640
I must have Zombie Movie Fest. And I found my copy of Shaun of the Dead.

44
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,640
So we must all watch this.

45
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,640
Alright. Sounds good.

46
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:15,640
Also joining us tonight, the one and only, the beautiful Loki.

47
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,640
I'm beautiful today, I guess.

48
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,640
Our sex symbol on the show here.

49
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:25,640
Wow, that's funny. I thought that was the ferret.

50
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:30,640
And to celebrate Loki being the sex symbol, he's actually wearing nothing but a bikini tonight.

51
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,640
And the shirt and pants, minus the bikini?

52
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:38,640
Again, reasons why we need to be a TV show.

53
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:44,640
So all of you out there can see through the lies. All the lies.

54
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:52,640
We won't be able to see through the lies because we'll be blinded by your white ass.

55
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,640
My ass is not that white.

56
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,640
I'll take your word for it. What do you tan your ass?

57
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,640
I don't tan my ass.

58
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:02,640
Are you a dude sunbather?

59
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:07,640
I don't sunbathe at all. That involves going outside. I don't like outside.

60
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:14,640
Alright, say hello to our special guest tonight, the one, the only, DDR Angel.

61
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,640
Hello.

62
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,640
How are you?

63
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,640
Good.

64
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,640
How are you today?

65
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,640
Nintendogs.

66
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,640
You're playing Nintendogs?

67
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,640
My Nintendogs, I think, floated to the top of the bowl, finally.

68
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,640
I think, uh...

69
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,640
Hey, I got a Dalmatian.

70
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,640
I named him IKEA.

71
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,640
I know, that was my...

72
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,640
Nice.

73
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,640
No, that wasn't my suggestion.

74
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,640
No, no.

75
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,640
My suggestion was Alpo.

76
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,640
That you name your dog Alpo.

77
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,640
You wouldn't name him Alpo, and he wouldn't respond to Alpo.

78
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:40,640
So, I named him IKEA after what looked like meatballs all over his body.

79
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,640
It was better than naming him, you know, Smallpox.

80
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,640
Oh.

81
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:51,640
Also, in the studio, say hello to the one and only newly-shaven, by the way.

82
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:56,640
That's what threw me off, is that X of her was telling me earlier today that he was never going to shave off his beard.

83
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,640
And he fucking did it!

84
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,640
He fucking did it!

85
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,640
Liar, liar, pants on fire.

86
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:10,000
I was going to do that little, you know, chin bacon strip thing, you know, is that what

87
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
that's called?

88
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,520
Yeah, it's called a bacon strip when it's in another place.

89
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,520
Oh, okay.

90
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,520
Well, I call it the chin bacon strip.

91
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,880
I thought that was the Brazilian wax job.

92
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,640
No, Brazilian wax...

93
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:24,560
I'll have extrovert explain a Brazilian wax job a little later in the show.

94
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,560
Brazilian wax job.

95
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,440
Maybe we should leave that to Mr. Spanky.

96
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,720
God, it's going to be one of those nights.

97
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,880
Why don't you look that up on Wikipedia?

98
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,880
See if we can...

99
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,880
Okay, I'll do that right now.

100
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:41,880
See if Brazilian wax jobs over on Wikipedia and you can explain that to all the kids exactly what that's all about.

101
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,880
Yeah, I just decided to shave it all off.

102
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,880
Did you shave it all off?

103
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,880
I'm totally bald.

104
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,880
I'm kidding.

105
00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:06,880
Okay. Yeah, anyway. Tonight's show should be okay. Tonight's gonna be an okay show. Don't get your hopes up. No, I'm kidding. We're gonna have a good time.

106
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,880
I saw Serenity again.

107
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:22,880
We're gonna talk about How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day. We're gonna talk about Orange on the Radio, Almost Jumping the Shark. We're gonna talk about My Little Surprise. We're gonna talk about a lot of stuff tonight. And maybe we'll play a game. We haven't played a game on the show in a while, so I think we need to do some Bimani match games.

108
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,880
Can we also talk about Opening the Door?

109
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:29,720
opening the door. Brazilian Waxing is on the Wikipedia. Is it? Okay. And I'm going to listen

110
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,560
to the chatroom. Darkstalker is going to research Brazilian Waxing and then talk to you all

111
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,400
about it soon. And Expert is going to open the damn door so we can get some air in here.

112
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:42,640
Thank you. Alright. We will be back after this. In this break I have queued up some

113
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:47,120
old school music. So it's just a potpourri of stuff. But it's old. Like all this shit

114
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:51,280
is like three years old. So we're going to hear some old shit. And stuff we don't play

115
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,280
Well, our listeners are used to that. They've been paying attention to us for three years.

116
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,280
Exactly. Three and a half.

117
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:02,280
Three and a half years. We're like toddlers. We're potty trained now. We're learning how to read.

118
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:07,280
Okay, suck, Reena. You know this wouldn't be the show if we didn't at least have five sexual references during the show.

119
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,280
Remember, adult.

120
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:18,280
Ron Chen says, Orange Lounge Radio, more sex, less bimani. Hey, in a perfect world, we would be about sex and bimani.

121
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:25,280
me. Yeah, anyway, we'll be back after this with Orange Launch Radio where we'll talk

122
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:32,280
video where we'll talk about a lot of SEX and some games.

123
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,280
Oh

124
00:09:55,280 --> 00:10:00,280
a

125
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:05,280
a

126
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:10,280
a

127
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:15,280
a

128
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:20,280
a

129
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,280
You

130
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,280
Come on, come on, come on!

131
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,280
Come on!

132
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:57,940
The

133
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:02,940
Hello? Hello, is this thing on? Testing? Testing 1-2?

134
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:06,940
I'm looking in the index, but I don't see anything for how to run a radio show.

135
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:10,940
Hello? I don't understand this. This thing works.

136
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,940
This thing reads like stereo instructions.

137
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:13,940
Is this on?

138
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:14,940
What the hell?

139
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:20,940
Orange Lounge Radio. Rope down. Get open body radio.

140
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:21,940
What the f***?

141
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:29,240
We are back, and Bob had to run to the bathroom with explosive diarrhea from the burrito he

142
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,380
ate a moment ago.

143
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:36,720
It really stinks, so he had the vent on and everything, but, um, I decided to go ahead

144
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:42,940
and fill the gap I would call our resident expert on all things that are very TMI, Mr.

145
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:43,940
Spanky!

146
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:50,940
Oh, do it all night, do it with me, I'll take you to the house, and make you feel free,

147
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:59,900
hello everybody oh my god it's been forever since I've been on this show

148
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:05,340
what's wrong with you people I thought you didn't love me hello everybody it's

149
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:11,580
mr. spanky it's your favorite DDR dancer from DDR PC

150
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:18,660
does anybody play DDR PC anymore I'm using it to hold up via the table

151
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:24,080
everybody forgot about me that's okay that's okay that you people forget about

152
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:28,840
mr. spanky because it gives me a lot of time to learn about sex and as I

153
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:33,400
understand it the kids today want to learn about Brazilian waxing I'm gonna

154
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:38,840
talk a little bit about Brazilian waxing to the kids today except okay if you're

155
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,920
like really a kid you don't want to listen cuz you're more than day I might

156
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:46,140
get upset with you for listening and anyway Brazilian waxing has to do with

157
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:50,300
your pubic hair. And if you're a kid, you don't have pubic hair. So this doesn't matter

158
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:59,300
to you. However, Dr. Sackler, I know you want to know about this stuff. So pay attention.

159
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:04,580
Okay, so I'm going to tell you guys about Brazilian waxing. Basically what it is, in

160
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:10,300
a Brazilian wax, it's a waxing of your pubic area. And it means you completely remove the

161
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:17,300
hair around your vulva. Okay, but you only have a vulva if you're a woman. If you're

162
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:22,700
a guy, it takes away all the hair around your penis. Okay? Not only that though, it's not

163
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:28,080
just like a pubic waxing job. A Brazilian wax means they wax your ass too. So they take

164
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:33,860
away all the hair around your anus. So in order for them to do this, they have to coat

165
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:38,780
you in hot wax. So they have to coat you in hot wax around your penis and your anus or

166
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:41,900
Or your boba if you're a girl.

167
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:45,120
So this means you have to get naked with whoever is doing it but you know some people like

168
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,060
to get naked so it's okay.

169
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:49,760
And so they're going to rip away all that wax and they're going to leave you with a

170
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:53,420
really clean butt and penis and vagina.

171
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:58,420
Well hopefully you don't have all three.

172
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:05,860
So anyway this is related to a type of sexual activity called acomoclictic which means you

173
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:11,140
have a preference for hairless genitals, and I happen to know for a fact, except for who

174
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:16,340
I ran into at the sex club the other night, has this preference for hairless genitals,

175
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:22,380
don't you? That was you? Yes, that was me, with the gag, and the ball. I was wondering

176
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:29,060
who that hairless anus belonged to, and now that I know it was you, I am so thrilled.

177
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:33,760
Okay. Well, I'm gonna go now, kids, so you can talk about the DDR, but I hope you learned

178
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:40,120
a good lesson today. So remember, check it out, DDRPC, Mr. Spanky, one of the downloadable

179
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:45,120
characters, only $5 in the bargain bin at Freud's. Bye, everybody!

180
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:49,120
Bye, Mr. Spanky! Rob, get out of the bathroom!

181
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:58,120
Oh, do it all night, do it with me, I'll take you to heaven if you make me feel free.

182
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:01,120
Make sure to spray some Febreze in there or something.

183
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,120
I'm back.

184
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,120
You better?

185
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,120
Yeah, I'm a little better.

186
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:06,120
You didn't tell anybody why I was gone, did you?

187
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,120
No.

188
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,120
Oh, okay.

189
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,120
Good.

190
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,120
All right.

191
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:13,120
Anyway, it says we were talking about jumping the shark.

192
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,120
Oh, yeah, yeah, we were going to talk about jumping the shark.

193
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,120
Well, let's get to first a little bit of How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day.

194
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,120
It's how we always like to start the show off.

195
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:23,120
I mean, we would never start the show any other way with things that are completely

196
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,120
random or rude or completely off base or anything.

197
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,120
Never.

198
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,120
No, never.

199
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,120
Dark Sakura.

200
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:32,120
You know, for any game companies that might be listening tonight.

201
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:36,120
Hahahaha.

202
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:40,120
DarkSakura, how was your week? How was your day?

203
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:44,120
My week was fabulous, in a really busy, crappy way.

204
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:48,120
Um, I played a new game that I'm not going to talk about right now.

205
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:52,120
And, uh, Dan got me the Lawyer game for DS.

206
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:56,120
I don't remember what it's called.

207
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,120
The Black Gate?

208
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,120
Phoenix Wright.

209
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,240
Phoenix Wright, Attorney at Law.

210
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,580
And he's been playing it!

211
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:03,600
I want to see this, it sounds cool.

212
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:08,920
And apparently it's been, like, you do murder cases and shit like that.

213
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:13,960
And then, uh, I played, I tried to play Katamari and it was like, ooh, it's Star Wars!

214
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:17,960
So, cause he bought, like, all the rest of the Star Wars, not Star Wars, Star Trek movies.

215
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,840
So he's been, like, uber Trekkie mode.

216
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,440
I finished season one of Stargate!

217
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,000
Ooh!

218
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,240
And then self serenity again, because I'm a big nerd.

219
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,720
That you are, no disputing that.

220
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:32,360
We had the Katrina relief sale on Friday night.

221
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,360
Yes we did.

222
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:40,640
So a whole bunch of stuff, and we've managed to pull in $130 for the charity, so we are

223
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:45,560
going to be delivering that, and all the leftovers are going to be going to the Salvation Army.

224
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:53,640
I also am going to be acquiring more things for giveaways on the show.

225
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,640
Very cool.

226
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,640
We like giveaways.

227
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:58,640
We're giving away two PSP games on tonight's podcast.

228
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,640
Fabulous.

229
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:08,600
I also started my Dreamweaver class, which is, I'll put it this way, how bored I was.

230
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,800
She made us stay in there for the whole two hour orientation so that she could show people

231
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,720
how to change font.

232
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:19,220
By the time the first person was done changing their background color, I had the assignment

233
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:21,880
that she wanted us to do done, uploaded ready.

234
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,440
I changed the text sizes.

235
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,080
I changed the fonts, I changed the background color,

236
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:31,160
I added in line breaks and the bar thing.

237
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,680
And then I even put a picture on it.

238
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,400
So I'll be linking that in the chat room,

239
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,300
what I did in my class.

240
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,880
I saw your web page.

241
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:42,080
And I did this in like 15 minutes.

242
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,960
That's actually with two revisions.

243
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,840
And after going back and adding in the stuff

244
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,700
that she wanted us to do in class.

245
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:52,160
And the TA came up and said, have you used this before?

246
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,720
I said, yeah, Dreamweaver 4.

247
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,520
She's like, that's the one I started with.

248
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,160
You're going to love this class.

249
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,240
So I've already made my impressions.

250
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:00,740
Good.

251
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:01,240
Good deal.

252
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,680
And I dropped a class.

253
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,600
What'd you drop?

254
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,600
Technical communication and plain English.

255
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,760
Awesome teacher, but four classes,

256
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,520
working full time, the show, and going to the gym,

257
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,440
ain't going to happen.

258
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:17,160
So I went to the gym twice this week.

259
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,100
Be proud of me.

260
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:18,600
Good job.

261
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,760
That's more times than I went to the gym.

262
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,120
I went to the gym real time.

263
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,120
And then I ate ice cream all day,

264
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,160
Because Baskin-Robbins has pumpkin ice cream,

265
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,680
and everyone should go have some.

266
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,720
I want to go have some.

267
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:28,360
I just might.

268
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,320
And that's it.

269
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,320
Loki, how was your week?

270
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,400
My week was OK.

271
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,840
Thursday, we left the Tahoe for our company's 25th anniversary.

272
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:39,920
So that was kind of cool.

273
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,400
We got a bunch of DVDs and stuff that I'll

274
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,480
be turning in for more games.

275
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,320
Then, was it last night?

276
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:53,960
We actually had a party for our 25th anniversary, and they had the coolest thing ever.

277
00:22:53,960 --> 00:23:01,000
They got the guy from that show, That's My Bush, to do this long ass, like, just speech

278
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,720
on video, and it's hilarious.

279
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:09,600
I mean, this guy is spot on for President Bush, so it was really cool, just really awesome,

280
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,560
and I drank lots of alcohol that was free.

281
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:14,200
So that was also cool.

282
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:21,900
The other thing I did this week was basically just, I don't know, try to play some more

283
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:22,900
new games.

284
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:32,420
I got SSX on tour, that was pretty cool, and I don't know, just same old stuff, work stuff,

285
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:38,180
and lots of driving, fucking hate driving, and worked on the PSP web page.

286
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:39,580
Lots of fun.

287
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:41,220
O-L-R-P-S-P dot com.

288
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,220
Yes.

289
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:43,220
It's sexy.

290
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:47,020
Check it out. It's gonna be even sexier soon. Ooh, good to hear.

291
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:51,020
Oh shit, I forgot that I linked this week. I talked to my main name.

292
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:52,220
Oh, what? You just linked it?

293
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:54,220
Um, I made a boo-boo.

294
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:56,220
Oh, well. Who cares?

295
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:58,220
Yeah, maybe the chatroom will notice what it is.

296
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:01,220
Yeah, right. Who will? Oh well.

297
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:02,220
Uh, is that it?

298
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:05,220
That'd be it. That's all I can think of that was interesting.

299
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:07,220
Okay, sounds good.

300
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:09,220
Uh, Xtaphar, how was your week? How was your day?

301
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:18,100
it went well I mean it was boring really didn't do really anything worked saw the

302
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:25,340
family yesterday you know did my shaven thing today you know but not the

303
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:29,100
Brazilian way no I didn't I didn't do the Brazilian why I can't shave my

304
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:35,740
genitals I mean if I shave my genitals I mean I break out so it it doesn't look

305
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:40,740
very pleasing to the eye. It looks like herpes? It doesn't look like herpes. That's the purpose

306
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:46,300
of waxing, you don't shave. Well waxing I'm pretty sure would make me break out too. Maybe

307
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:52,440
I just have really sensitive skin around the area. I think we all have sensitive skin around

308
00:24:52,440 --> 00:25:05,840
the area yeah especially the penis and you know let's say the balls so that's

309
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:11,720
that's that one episode of Beavis and Butthead where the gym teachers like

310
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:17,160
today we're going to talk about the penis forget it

311
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:21,160
Whoo! How was your week? How was your day, Angel?

312
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:24,400
My computer exploded on Friday.

313
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:28,560
It, like, literally blew up in a giant hall of flames? I don't know. The power supply went

314
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:32,320
poof, so... Angel doesn't have a computer

315
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,560
for a while, unless

316
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:38,680
I can, like, fix it tonight. I've been having

317
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:43,480
trouble with it for the last couple days. It's been doing some weird stuff that I...

318
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:46,560
So what exactly does the power supply do when it explodes?

319
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:49,560
It stinks really bad.

320
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,560
Shut up, Exeter.

321
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:58,560
Comments that nobody could hear except for me.

322
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,560
Yeah, that's fine.

323
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:04,560
And we went to a party yesterday, but that's okay.

324
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:10,560
And it was fun and it was good to see people and stuff like that.

325
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:13,560
And yeah, I guess that's it.

326
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:19,560
Um, I've been working, uh, in school and stuff like that.

327
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:27,560
Uh, that's it. Oh, and I found my Final Fantasy XI discs, so you know what I'm gonna be doing this week if I can get the computer running.

328
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,560
Addict!

329
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:31,560
Hey! I've also been playing World of Warcraft.

330
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,560
You need to be playing World of Warcraft with me, thank you.

331
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,560
Yeah, I have that. I've been playing that for-

332
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,560
What stuff are you on?

333
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:40,560
Right now, I'm playing on Maelstrom, but, um, I also have-

334
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,560
I'm playing on Scarlet Crusade.

335
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:47,560
Yeah, I have one on Scarlet Crusade that I haven't logged into for a week because of...

336
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,560
I'm only level 7, so it's all cool.

337
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:52,560
Yeah. I'll wait for you to catch up to me then.

338
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:55,560
I'm like 32 on that server.

339
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:58,560
Anyway, yeah, that's it for me I guess. Bye.

340
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,560
Okay, bye.

341
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,560
Until later.

342
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:07,560
Okay. Let's see, what did I do this week? Really, not a whole lot.

343
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,560
I worked my ass off, that's what I did.

344
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:22,560
And I haven't had time for a whole lot of games. I've just been playing Castlevania DS a lot, which I'm making very slow progress on, and I've been playing a little bit of Final Fantasy XI.

345
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:30,560
Not a lot, though. I haven't gained a level or anything. Final Fantasy XI is kind of annoying me, but I'll talk about that later.

346
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:34,560
Final Fantasy XI is getting very annoying, so we'll talk about that later.

347
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:46,560
Um, and, um, I think that's really about it. I mean, God, I went to Target, like, twice this weekend, which is pretty cool, because I love Target. Is Target not the greatest store, ever?

348
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,560
Um, I, it's not.

349
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,560
People Walmart.

350
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:50,560
I don't, see, I don't like Walmart.

351
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,560
Oh my God.

352
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,560
I don't like going into Walmart.

353
00:27:52,560 --> 00:28:03,560
Thinking about Walmart, like, I went to my hometown this weekend, and, like, they're building the biggest-ass Walmart there. There's, like, four entrances in the front. It's going to be a super center.

354
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,560
And we're getting one around the corner from my house.

355
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,560
Really?

356
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:10,560
Super Walmart is the best if you're poor and need groceries, because you get real groceries, but they're half the price.

357
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,560
I want Super Target.

358
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:15,560
There's a Super Target in the place that I grew up as well.

359
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,560
But you can't get cheap groceries.

360
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,560
They don't have a full grocery store in them.

361
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:25,560
And not at Target Greatland, but there's also Super Target. It might have a different name, but there's three levels of Target.

362
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,560
There's regular Target, Greatland, and then Mondo Target.

363
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,560
Uber Target!

364
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,560
Uber Target, like really big Target.

365
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:33,560
We just need the Orange Lodge Grocery Store.

366
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:36,560
Has a little, you know, video games section.

367
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:41,560
You know, my dream grocery store would be just like that old TV show, Shop Till You Drop.

368
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,560
That's still on.

369
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,560
Is that still on?

370
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,560
Yeah.

371
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,560
No, what?

372
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,560
No, wait, Shop Till You Drop.

373
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,560
Is it the old-ass reruns from like the early, late 80s?

374
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,560
No, no, they still have, it was the one that was on Lifetime, right?

375
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,560
Yeah.

376
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,560
Yeah, they still have that.

377
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:55,560
It's like on, I think it's on PAX TV.

378
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,560
Lifetime television for women.

379
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:59,560
Yeah, now it's on Lifetime television for Christians.

380
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:04,880
Christians, um, you know, PAX TV. Oh, PAX TV. Yeah, but, um, no, it's, it's, uh, it's

381
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:09,120
still on there, I believe. Supermarket Sweep, that's what it's called. Supermarket Sweep

382
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:13,440
is rad, okay? Oh, why was I thinking Shop To You Drop? That must have been another show.

383
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,840
There was, oh, I think that was one that was where they go. Oh, it was the mall. There's

384
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:20,380
the mall one, yeah, they don't have that one anymore. I didn't mean that one, I meant Supermarket

385
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:25,640
Sweep. That's what I meant. Okay, yeah, they still have that. Supermarket Sweep is badass.

386
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:29,420
You'd like throw in those canned hams into this cart?

387
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:30,800
It was pretty badass.

388
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,900
But they never ever won.

389
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:35,640
They never ever found all of the things that they needed.

390
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,040
They totally won on that show.

391
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,040
I've seen it.

392
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:41,000
Like, I didn't.

393
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,760
I've seen winners.

394
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,760
I've seen winners.

395
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,720
I can't believe I got those two shows confused.

396
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,040
Weren't they on in like the same hour?

397
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,320
Like it was like the shopping hour on Lifetime?

398
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,320
Yeah, I believe it was.

399
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,320
Okay.

400
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:56,120
I figured it out.

401
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:58,560
The chat room is correcting me because we're like,

402
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:01,200
there's like a minute of lag between the chat and us.

403
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,840
It's just always kind of funny because everybody's yelling,

404
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:05,400
it's supermarket sweep, not chat till you drop.

405
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:08,200
Our chat room, by the way, www.orangeontrader.com.

406
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:11,120
Click on chat if you want to chat away with us.

407
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,720
All right.

408
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:18,640
Let's start off tonight by talking about a little bit

409
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,320
of follow up from last week.

410
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,200
Bleached assholes?

411
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,000
No, not that.

412
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
No, no, no. I think we should talk about bleach circles.

413
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
No, I'm done with the sex talk for tonight. Jesus.

414
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
I'm not.

415
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
I know you're never done with the sex talk. That's your problem.

416
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:37,000
All right. Let's talk about what happened this week with Orange Launch Radio.

417
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Jamie, do you want to kind of set this story up? What happened?

418
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Is this about Thursday?

419
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Yes.

420
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Okay. Last week, I got an email. Well, technically the week before.

421
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
before.

422
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:54,840
I get an email from our friends at KCRA, the local news station, the ones who had interviewed

423
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,440
us before about podcasting.

424
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,800
You might remember the KCRA interview as very famous.

425
00:30:58,800 --> 00:30:59,800
It was so much fun.

426
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:03,080
Oh, it's so much fun.

427
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:13,480
So I get an email from their project manager who wants us to work for a story play testing

428
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:17,960
a game brought to us by Red Octane.

429
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:21,960
Now instantly we're like, is this in the groove?

430
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,960
No, it wasn't.

431
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:29,960
But admittedly, until Thursday, I was operating on the assumption that yes, it was going to be in the groove and another game.

432
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:32,960
So that's why I was commenting last week that you guys are going to get a big kick out of this,

433
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:38,960
because we're going to be talking about in the groove on TV and getting our honest, unedited opinion on the game.

434
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:42,960
But no, instead it's another game.

435
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:50,000
On Thursday, in my living room, which everyone can now see the awesomeness of my red couches,

436
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,840
we played Guitar Hero.

437
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:55,800
And that game is awesome.

438
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:59,720
So I didn't get to do this because of a scheduling conflict, meaning my boss wouldn't give me

439
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:02,560
the day off work.

440
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,560
You guys got to go play Guitar Hero.

441
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:07,280
So you and Loki are going to be in a segment.

442
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,280
When's this going to air?

443
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,280
Do we know?

444
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,280
In a couple weeks.

445
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:14,280
on the confirmation email from... I actually would work with another project manager.

446
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:17,280
Okay, cool. So we'll actually post this on the site, obviously, when it's ready.

447
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,280
We'll let you guys know about this.

448
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:23,280
So what's the deal? What happened with Guitar Hero? What's it like? Tell us all about it.

449
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:28,280
Well, first of all, everyone needs a picture in their head what the...

450
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:33,280
and I'm going to use the easiest comparison, the controller.

451
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,280
Imagine the Guitar Freaks controller.

452
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:43,280
Now, imagine the body style license from Gibson, as in a real guitar shape, five buttons, and

453
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:45,280
a whammy bar.

454
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:47,200
So yeah, it's pretty awesome.

455
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,760
And the way that you move your hands like, it has an interface, because the game is put

456
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,080
up by harmonics.

457
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:58,880
The people who gave us res, not res, frequency and amplitude, why'd I say res, but it has

458
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:04,480
a very similar interface where the keys are coming toward you, but on your easiest difficulty

459
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:09,320
you have three, then it goes to four on medium, then it's five and up for the harder difficulties.

460
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:15,400
If I remember correctly, I think it's three for easy, um, medium is three with the occasional

461
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:23,240
fourth. Well, it goes up to four for medium, that's just what I just said. Anyway, um,

462
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:27,360
but the way that you're moving your hands on it as you play it has a very, very real

463
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:33,600
guitar feel to it you're they even go so far as to what they call it fret buttons

464
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:39,120
your the little switch for you know where your strings would be is actually

465
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:42,360
called the strum bar and you have your whammy bar it's built with micro

466
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:46,600
switches in it so you can actually hold them you have a notes that you hold like

467
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:50,520
you're really strumming them it's really pretty cool you build up your meter by

468
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:57,160
by wailing hard songs I played in it I played I want to be sedated I played

469
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:02,160
twenty, twenty, twenty-four hours ago. I want to be the baby.

470
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,160
That sounds awesome.

471
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:05,160
And I played More Than a Feeling, which was Boston.

472
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,160
Oh.

473
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:12,160
That's on one of the, they have them grouped as like groups of five songs in each difficulty class.

474
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:13,160
Oh.

475
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:17,160
And then as you play, but you can actually do each song on it at different difficulties too.

476
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:23,160
So you will basically judge, you can work up through the list on easy and then work up through the list on medium

477
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:25,160
and actually get your challenge out of it that way.

478
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:27,920
weird setup. So it's not like a giant song wheel like we're used to in the

479
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:36,080
Beaumont games? No. In this game, if Guitar Freaks were a 10, this game would blow that

480
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:39,400
scale apart and put it up, you know, it would be a hundred on a scale of one to

481
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:44,080
ten, I think. Wow. It's really awesome. Now, is it set up like frequency and amplitude

482
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:46,840
then? Because that's how, okay, that's how like frequency and amplitude are. It's like

483
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:49,920
groups of five and then you play through it and then there's like the bonus song

484
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:53,640
you might unlock at the end. The bonus songs are actually, are all originals,

485
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:57,680
original songs. So this sounds to me like it's pretty much

486
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:01,160
frequency and amplitude we finally get our sequel except now it's a guitar

487
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:05,600
game. And they are actually only going to be sold with the guitar with a

488
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:08,600
price of retail $69.99

489
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:12,320
but the guitar controller is the best controller

490
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:15,520
of any type of non-traditional peripheral I have ever

491
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:19,340
ever seen. It actually has substance and weight to it, not like heavy heavy

492
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:22,640
but it definitely feels more substantial than the guitar freaks controllers honestly

493
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:27,640
The song list was fabulous. I mean, it was just really awesome stuff.

494
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:31,640
Were there actual songs in it, or was it mostly karaoke-style covers?

495
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,640
They were remakes, however, they were done...

496
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:37,640
They even went so far as to recreate vocal effects.

497
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:44,640
Just hearing about a lot of the steps they went through to make it as authentic as possible,

498
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,640
as close to the original as possible, just completely...

499
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:50,640
It was really, really awesome.

500
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:54,960
Now, Harmonix obviously had a huge part to do with this game, so it really does sound

501
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:55,960
like...

502
00:35:55,960 --> 00:36:00,260
Because Harmonix obviously also had a big hand in Karaoke Revolution, and the remakes

503
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:03,500
or whatever they did for Karaoke Revolution were not bad.

504
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:04,500
They weren't bad.

505
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:07,480
I mean, obviously not the original, but they're not bad, all things considered.

506
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,160
I've heard much worse remakes.

507
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:13,720
So kind of that same level of quality going into Guitar Hero, then.

508
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:14,720
Pretty much.

509
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:20,060
I mean, it's like they spared no expense, wasted, you know, nothing.

510
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:25,740
that could have gone into the game to make it feel like the experience of being on stage

511
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:29,660
and playing in guitar, they've gone out of their way to do. On top of that, you actually

512
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:34,980
in your career mode, you have a selectable character list. One of the characters was

513
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:38,820
based off of Keith Richards, but when I first saw this character, me being the Gorillaz

514
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:44,900
fan I am, he was playing a Flying V. I was like, did they put Murdock in this game? Because

515
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:49,420
I was like, excuse me, but no, it was actually based off of Keith Richards directly, so I

516
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:55,460
thought was funny. I had a nerd moment. That's cool. Um, but, it was, there's mega death

517
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:59,540
in that game. Symphony of Destruction is in that game. What were some of the other songs

518
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:05,340
you guys can remember? This is Stevie Ray Vaughan, um, who else do you remember? What

519
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:11,020
did you play? I played Smoke on the Water. Okay. Cause that was awesome. I also played

520
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:16,660
Iron Man. And, uh, I think it was like Turn It Up or whatever. Where that stupid song

521
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:18,660
What song is that? It's in the PSP commercial.

522
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:19,660
Franz Ferdinand song.

523
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:22,660
Yeah, Franz Ferdinand. I played that.

524
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:29,660
I checked out some of the unlocked songs because there is apparently a way to key press to unlock all the songs because we watched them do it.

525
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:30,660
Yep.

526
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:38,660
So, yeah. Anyways, they had some of the original songs like Guitar Hero, of course, was one that they came up with.

527
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:42,660
And then I was looking for, apparently there's a freeze-pop song in there, but I didn't see it.

528
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:44,660
Well, of course, there's got to be a freeze-pop song.

529
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:46,660
What's the first thing that is a Ziggy Stardust?

530
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:47,660
Oh, cool.

531
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:50,660
That's cool.

532
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:51,660
Sorry.

533
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:55,660
Yeah, the controller, it's just like a normal controller.

534
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:57,660
Buttons are sticking.

535
00:37:57,660 --> 00:38:02,660
I had a little bit of button sticking problem, but it wasn't bad.

536
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:06,660
It was really, you know, it's just like up stuck, fixed, done.

537
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:07,660
Who cares?

538
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,660
It's pretty cool, though.

539
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:10,660
Really easy to get into.

540
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:18,660
The whammy bar thing though kind of throws you off when you're trying to do that because you're supposed to hold the note down for so long and then do a whammy bar thing and it's like, it takes a while to get used to it.

541
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:28,660
But, um, looks pretty good. Um, I can see the potential for some lawsuits. The game is a little similar to other games, but, um...

542
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:50,660
The differences I think are substantial enough that they can't, the controller is so completely, you can't do a guitar controller without having it be similar. However, after a little bit of interviewing, the controllers are actually completely built from the ground up. The Switch is built on a different mechanism than the Guitar Freaks controller.

543
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:58,660
I'm talking about Guitar Freaks. I'm talking about another game. I'm saying this game's too much like Karaoke Revolution. The interface and everything's too similar.

544
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:01,660
But Harmonix co-made it, so who cares?

545
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:02,660
Oh, I get it, that's fine then.

546
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:08,660
They own the patent, so. And on top of that, it doesn't flow side to side, it flows forward.

547
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:10,660
Eh, whatever. It's an okay game.

548
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:17,660
Harmonix developed and Konami published Karaoke Revolution, and this time Red Octane is publishing Guitar Hero.

549
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:37,660
It's a step in the right direction for Octane actually getting real companies to develop games for them, so I think that's great, but I don't know. It's good. I'm looking forward to it since we're not going to get Guitar Freaks until at least next fall. At least, probably never, but yeah, at least.

550
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:41,660
This game is going to completely blow Guitar Freaks out of the water. I'm sorry.

551
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:57,660
It sounds interesting because if Guitar Freaks now comes out later this time, they're going to, if it's happening, we don't know, but we can speculate that since Guitar Freaks V is coming out overseas, that maybe now is the time for it here, if it's going to come out.

552
00:39:57,660 --> 00:40:08,660
I'm awfully surprised that they didn't jump with that first instead of Beatmania because I think Guitar Freaks is pretty easy to market to people instead of Beatmania, whereas, you know, DJ Simulator playing a guitar, okay, that makes more sense.

553
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:12,620
makes more sense. But they're also coming from the import fan base, I think. And how

554
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:17,940
was DDR really successful? A lot of it was word of mouth, and Beatmania has a really

555
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:22,420
rabid fan base established, although I think that rabid fan base is going to turn a little

556
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:28,460
bit on a US version, just because you've seen what's happened with DDR, and people bitch

557
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:32,260
because, you know, it's not as good as the Japanese versions, and I have this bad feeling

558
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:35,060
the same thing's going to happen here, although we don't know yet because we haven't seen

559
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:36,060
The other thing that's...

560
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:37,060
But...

561
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:38,060
Sorry, sorry.

562
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:40,220
I just want to finish my thought here.

563
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:42,140
Guitar Freaks does not have that same fan base.

564
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:46,540
I mean, granted, there are loyal Guitar Freaks players out there, but you don't exactly see

565
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:50,060
GuitarFreak.com or things like that.

566
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:51,060
You know what I mean?

567
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:55,580
Like, there's a very established BeatMania base on, like, Bamani-style, very established

568
00:40:55,580 --> 00:41:02,900
DDR base on DDR Freak, but no real solid Guitar Freak base, if you know what I mean.

569
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:07,900
One thing to mention, though, is all the songs are full-length, so that is something kind of cool.

570
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:10,900
Although I was kind of wishing that there would be some short versions, too.

571
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:15,900
Kind of like how Karaoke Revolution doesn't have the option of playing a shorter or longer version of the song.

572
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:18,900
Would have been nice, but still really cool.

573
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:20,900
Yeah.

574
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:24,900
Now, the other thing, though, this other story that they're doing about In the Groove, though,

575
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:28,900
I couldn't help but think that this story's been done before.

576
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:34,860
the whole, like, oh, people using the game to lose weight. I mean, come on. It's been

577
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:38,540
done with DDR. It's just another freaking game ripping off on DDR. Of course, you're

578
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:41,660
going to lose weight because you're moving around. It's just the same story all over

579
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:44,260
again, though. I didn't really see why they were covering that.

580
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:46,620
But they didn't talk to you guys about that story at all.

581
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:49,140
No, they didn't. They didn't. But they're talking to other people in the community.

582
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:53,980
But still, it's the same thing. It's like, you know, I don't know. It'd be like, you

583
00:41:53,980 --> 00:42:17,980
doing a story about, like, oh, teen people are playing violent video games, like Grand Theft Auto, and, you know, some people are saying that it's causing kids to commit murder. Okay, now we have kids playing a game called 25 to Life, which is just like Grand Theft Auto, but now we're going to cover the same story all over again, just with another game. It's really repetitive.

584
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:22,980
I just find it hilarious that we're still getting all this crap about

585
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:27,980
video games cause violence, yet it's been proven that they don't.

586
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:37,980
But people want to ignore facts and, you know, have their scandal. So, what can we do about it, huh?

587
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:40,980
What else will the media say about video games?

588
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:46,480
Now we're going to get this one. Orange Jones Radio is saying that video games don't cause violence.

589
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,980
You know what causes violence?

590
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:48,980
People cause violence.

591
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:50,980
Sucked up people cause violence.

592
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:53,980
I cause violence.

593
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:57,980
Guns don't kill people. I do.

594
00:42:57,980 --> 00:43:01,980
Nah, I don't know. It looks like a good game. I'm really looking forward to it.

595
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:03,980
It's supposed to be coming out I guess in November.

596
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:04,980
Guitar Hero?

597
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:09,980
Yeah. So it'll be good. Yeah, not really much more to say.

598
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:13,380
I want to play it. I'm pissed I didn't get to go and be a media whore like you two.

599
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:17,980
I got a lot of footage of me playing the game. I did, however, slip.

600
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:22,740
Did you say it's so fun? I didn't say it's so much fun, but I said

601
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:26,420
it's so fun. So that's almost as bad.

602
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:30,420
And I know what you're hoping. Dear God.

603
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:35,500
Dear God. Whenever there's a YM talking, whatever they are called.

604
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:38,300
I'm praying here. Dear God, who art in heaven.

605
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:43,860
Please, I've been a good boy this year and I go to church every Sunday.

606
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:48,340
Okay, even if that church is called Burger King, who cares?

607
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:51,460
I praise God in my own special way.

608
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:55,700
God, don't listen to him. I'm praying. God,

609
00:43:55,700 --> 00:44:01,180
if you're listening right now, I really, really, really, really, really want

610
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:04,400
KCRA to use the clip of Loki going,

611
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:07,700
this is so fun and nothing else in

612
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:12,200
God please show lots of Jamie in the story show lots and lots of Jamie but

613
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:12,700
please

614
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:16,200
only show Loki saying it's oh so much fun or whatever the hell he said

615
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:19,600
I appreciate it love and amen Rob

616
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:23,600
Jesus Christ

617
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:27,400
I even caught my sulfur after I'm like ah shit

618
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:32,600
I can't wait

619
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:36,600
I'm gonna have my TiVo ready.

620
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:40,600
I know I'm gonna watch it and be disappointed again.

621
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:44,600
Just gonna be disappointed.

622
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:48,600
Alright, we'll see what happens. At least you guys get to be on TV, I'm not even there.

623
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:52,600
I'm just gonna pretend to be bitter about it for a while, so. Nah, that's cool.

624
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:56,600
I probably actually, I probably won't even be in it. I'll just be

625
00:44:56,600 --> 00:45:00,600
playing the guitar game. Or you'll see your feet. Or your hands. Cause your feet were in the paper

626
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:02,600
So why not have your hands on TV? That'd be pretty cool.

627
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:03,600
Yeah, the hands might work.

628
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:04,600
Alright.

629
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:06,600
Or I'll be doing something retarded.

630
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:11,600
Because I was trying to over-exaggerate the movements that you would play during the game

631
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:13,600
in hopes of more TV time.

632
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:14,600
But...

633
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:21,600
So we're gonna see this clip of Loki during the whammy bar like he's gonna drop to his knees

634
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:22,600
and go,

635
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:25,600
I should've done that shit!

636
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:27,600
I wasn't thinking. See, I didn't prepare.

637
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:34,600
It's gonna be like that scene in Risky Business where Loki just comes out in a t-shirt in his undies and slides across the floor playing the guitar.

638
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:36,600
That's what we're gonna see on the news.

639
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:40,600
I remember one time Dan bringing out my DDR pad on Dreamcast.

640
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:42,600
Cause it was just sitting there.

641
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:49,600
And grabbing one of the Guitar Freaks guitars and then rolling around on the floor being a freak, wailing hard.

642
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:54,600
So he decided that they needed a new game using the iToy called Air Guitar Freaks.

643
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:55,600
Have it.

644
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:57,840
Why not? They can do Samba de Amigo with the...

645
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:00,120
They have a guitar game in iToyPlay3.

646
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:00,880
What?

647
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:01,680
Yeah, air guitar.

648
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:03,240
There's an iToyPlay3?

649
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:03,640
Yes.

650
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:04,320
I didn't know that.

651
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:05,720
Yeah, no one buys them!

652
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:06,880
iToyPlay1 sucks!

653
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:11,720
Okay, they have iToyPlay1, iToyPlay2, iToyPlay3, and SpyToy.

654
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:12,960
They also have iToyChat.

655
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:13,760
SpyToy?

656
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:14,840
SpyToy.

657
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:17,960
Does that mean you can use it to spy on your neighbors who have iToys in their houses?

658
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:23,360
No, you can use it as a surveillance system, and you can also play spy-themed games.

659
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:27,360
Let me tell you, there's a lot of itoy games out there that you never hear about, because they suck.

660
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:28,360
All of them suck.

661
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:32,360
I want to get itoy chat, and then just sit on the couch naked.

662
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:39,360
Is that wrong?

663
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:41,360
Do you need to pray again?

664
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:42,360
No, I don't.

665
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:46,360
Dear God, please! Don't let this haven go to hell!

666
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:48,360
Okay. Stop stealing my bit.

667
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:54,360
I just want to get itoy chat and then just, you know, join the room and hey guys, what's

668
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:55,360
up?

669
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:56,760
I'm just letting it all hang out tonight.

670
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:58,360
What are you guys up to?

671
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:00,280
Do they moderate on itoy chat?

672
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:01,280
How can they?

673
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:02,280
They can't moderate that, can they?

674
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:09,360
You can do, I think, up to 20 or 15 people per room or whatever and you can chat via

675
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:11,760
video and voice.

676
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:14,760
I think you can do up to 100 people via text chat.

677
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:16,420
Do they have adult rated rooms, though?

678
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:18,280
Because like, you know, look at Yahoo!

679
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:22,040
like the yahoo messenger program, you can do webcams on yahoo

680
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:26,240
but the only thing i know that people use that yahoo cam thing for

681
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:28,420
is for sex

682
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:32,320
or web sex, whatever they call it, cam sex, whatever the hell they call it. Well, I'm not into cam sex

683
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:37,360
I'm not going to not cam sex for those of you that are into it. Here's the really crappy stuff you can do, you can actually play games

684
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:38,440
like they have

685
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:40,680
you know chess, maybe you can do strip chess

686
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:41,720
bank of the monkey

687
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:46,640
strip battleship. Wait, you can play chess using your hands and stuff?

688
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:51,240
you can play chess or any appendage that you can play um... battleship or

689
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:54,880
naval war is what they call it

690
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:58,640
oh you suck my battleship

691
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:00,800
oh baby sink it

692
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:02,520
but anyways uh...

693
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:04,880
no they've got uh...

694
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:07,540
a lot of weird games in this thing uh...

695
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:09,600
it says you can do

696
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:10,920
what the hell

697
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:14,000
i think you can just make your own rules

698
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:20,000
That would sell some itoys. You can turn into a videophone, so I guess.

699
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:30,000
But you know that there would be underage porn, because all the 16 and 17 year olds that have itoys are going to run around naked on it, and that's just wrong. We can't have that.

700
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:38,360
you know, so. Yeah, I don't know, I don't know about that, but yeah, Itoy Chat 3, in

701
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:47,840
fact, if I remember correctly, I think that came out last month. I just, I know that these

702
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:57,240
games sucked, so. I played, I played Itoy Play 2 at E3 and I was thoroughly unimpressed.

703
00:48:57,240 --> 00:49:03,240
I was more impressed with the Harry Potter I-Toy game than I was with I-Toy Play 2.

704
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:06,240
And even though Harry Potter games...

705
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:09,240
Come on folks, doesn't this look a little disgusting?

706
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:12,240
I'm going to show you a picture, of course this is a great radio.

707
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:13,240
Post it in the chat.

708
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:15,240
I mean, that doesn't look...

709
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:16,240
Wow!

710
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:17,240
Wow!

711
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:18,240
Post that in the chat.

712
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:19,240
Please post that in chat.

713
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:21,240
That's orangehonestradio.com.

714
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:22,240
Click on chat.

715
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:26,240
It's these people, and the game is blowing up balloons.

716
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:33,800
balloons, but the way the balloons are positioned, it looks like you're blowing up a boner.

717
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:38,760
And this one woman on the end with her yellow balloon, she's all into it. She's like, oh,

718
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:46,680
damn, what's the, oh, I got a big balloon. I don't know, what the hell, that's great.

719
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:52,320
Please check that out in chat. Yeah, it's really bad. They have another one called Call

720
00:49:52,320 --> 00:50:01,040
kitty. I guess, I don't know. And this looks really weird. I don't know what the hell this

721
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:09,920
game... No one should play itoy games ever. I mean, I don't think anyone should actually

722
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:15,320
buy the itoy. I talked about doing this a while back, you know. I have a ton of itoy

723
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:18,720
games. We should just really do a review of all the itoy games out there, because it'll

724
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:22,220
like five minutes I mean really there's not that much I've only played I toy

725
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:27,420

Well, we'll just come back cold.

761
00:58:42,020 --> 00:58:46,900
Hi, we're back on Orange Lounge Radio, unprofessional internet radio.

762
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:47,980
We do this shit for free.

763
00:58:47,980 --> 00:58:48,980
What can we say?

764
00:58:48,980 --> 00:58:51,300
Mistakes happen once in a while.

765
00:58:51,300 --> 00:58:57,700
All right, here we are back on the show and we're going to talk a little bit about some

766
00:58:57,700 --> 00:58:59,460
Some things, just random things.

767
00:58:59,460 --> 00:59:01,580
Exafir, you wanted to share something with our listeners, then we're going to get on

768
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:02,580
Skype, guys.

769
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:03,580
It's about bleached assholes.

770
00:59:03,580 --> 00:59:04,580
No, it's not about bleached assholes.

771
00:59:04,580 --> 00:59:05,580
It is about bleached assholes.

772
00:59:05,580 --> 00:59:10,980
Well, you know, it may be about bleached assholes one of these days.

773
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:20,820
So I'm actually in the process of having my own show on orangelandsradio.com, and you

774
00:59:20,820 --> 00:59:26,020
all should listen, and it's going to be on Mondays, and it's going to be called Exafir's

775
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:30,980
case of the Mondays, and it's a good show for all of you that are wanting to, you know,

776
00:59:30,980 --> 00:59:35,820
start off your week with something a little bit light and something you don't have to

777
00:59:35,820 --> 00:59:40,860
really pay attention. Plus, I'll say a lot of really horrible things on it, probably.

778
00:59:40,860 --> 00:59:46,860
So you guys should all listen. Uh, yeah.

779
00:59:46,860 --> 00:59:47,860
When's the state viewing?

780
00:59:47,860 --> 00:59:48,860
Yay!

781
00:59:48,860 --> 00:59:50,860
When's the state viewing?

782
00:59:50,860 --> 00:59:57,860
Hopefully a week from tomorrow, and I'm hoping that it will be 7 to 9.

783
00:59:57,860 --> 01:00:03,860
I will talk about video games for all of you that are into that sort of thing, I don't know.

784
01:00:03,860 --> 01:00:07,860
And then for the other hour, cause we're talking about Captain Tight Pants.

785
01:00:07,860 --> 01:00:10,860
I will talk about Captain Tight Pants.

786
01:00:10,860 --> 01:00:15,860
It's for all of the, you know, Orange Lawn's radio is filled with straight guys,

787
01:00:15,860 --> 01:00:19,860
so I feel like, hey, I'll be the queer voice for the straight guys here.

788
01:00:19,860 --> 01:00:27,120
Hello. Oh, no, no, no, like I'm not a guy no straight straight people. Sorry PC straight people

789
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:32,160
Oh wait, so you so you basically extra verse case of the Monday is like it's it's very queer

790
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:36,180
Eye for the gamer guy for people who don't enjoy it for the game gay

791
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:38,420
Nevermind

792
01:00:38,420 --> 01:00:41,420
What were you saying queer ear for the straight?

793
01:00:43,060 --> 01:00:49,100
Queer voice for the straight guys ear. That's what I said. Okay. Well, no, um queer cock for the straight guys ass

794

01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:29,600
Let me know also

803
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:31,880
Forget it, okay

804
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:38,140
But your title is fabulous. Yay, and you can email me if you have any suggestions on what you want me to talk about as

805
01:01:38,140 --> 01:01:40,140
well, my email address is

806
01:01:40,140 --> 01:01:44,140
is Volumetext. We'll get you an orange launch one.

807
01:01:44,140 --> 01:01:47,660
Okay. Well, right now, I mean, you can still email me at my

808
01:01:47,660 --> 01:01:54,740
other address. It's volumetext.gmail.com. That's all it says, also, if they send it, if they go ahead and send it to the

809
01:01:54,740 --> 01:01:57,800
podcast email, I'll forward it. Just say, 2X defer.

810
01:01:57,800 --> 01:02:02,220
And now you're going to also be doing a lot of Buffy and Serenity talk, I'm sure.

811
01:02:02,220 --> 01:02:06,420
I'm sure I will, you know, and I will talk about

812
01:02:06,420 --> 01:02:10,540
other things as well right now

813
01:02:10,540 --> 01:02:15,860
like Captain Tight Pants. Also coming up a week from Wednesday if I play my cards

814
01:02:15,860 --> 01:02:16,340
right

815
01:02:16,340 --> 01:02:19,640
I will be coming back with a solo show the launch date

816
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:22,780
a week from Wednesday. I know I've been talking about doing a solo show for a long

817
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:23,660
long time now

818
01:02:23,660 --> 01:02:26,880
but it will actually happen for sure I'll be coming back

819
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:31,000
a week from Wednesday. That's Captain Tight Pants? No, not Captain Tight Pants. I do not have a

820
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,680
name for the show yet so until I get a better name it's just gonna be the Rob

821
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:34,380
Roberts show

822
01:02:34,380 --> 01:02:39,380
And, um, a little thing, I'm actually doing mine every other week because of school constraints.

823
01:02:39,380 --> 01:02:46,380
When I'm out of, when the semesters are over, I will be going back to, uh,

824
01:02:46,380 --> 01:02:47,380
Some, uh, regular, every week.

825
01:02:47,380 --> 01:02:48,380
Regular.

826
01:02:48,380 --> 01:02:50,380
Just for the next nine weeks, every other week.

827
01:02:50,380 --> 01:02:53,380
Alright, sounds good.

828
01:02:53,380 --> 01:02:55,380
Maybe you should call your show the Rod Roddy show.

829
01:02:55,380 --> 01:03:01,380
No, because he died, and that's sad.

830
01:03:01,380 --> 01:03:06,260
Anyway, so that's going to be coming back, and I will not talk about such gay things.

831
01:03:06,260 --> 01:03:09,220
I mean, I realize I'm gay, but I have other things to talk about other than, you know,

832
01:03:09,220 --> 01:03:10,220
who I'm fucking.

833
01:03:10,220 --> 01:03:15,820
So I'm going to talk about tech stuff and geeky news, and yes, some video games, but

834
01:03:15,820 --> 01:03:19,460
I'm going to kind of go outside the realm and talk about cool things on the interweb,

835
01:03:19,460 --> 01:03:20,980
and just whatever I want.

836
01:03:20,980 --> 01:03:24,500
It's going to be my thing to just do whatever I want, and for those of you guys that miss

837
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:29,460
Vanilla Sky and Outside the Box, unfortunately, you know, I haven't gotten the folks that

838
01:03:29,460 --> 01:03:33,020
or on that show to commit to come back and I think we're gonna have scheduling problems

839
01:03:33,020 --> 01:03:36,600
but hopefully once in a while they'll drop in or something as time goes on. But for now

840
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:41,560
this is just gonna be my solo thingy. But I'll try to have guests as well. So we'll

841
01:03:41,560 --> 01:03:49,600
be working on that. So that's it. We're gonna have live shows Monday, every other Tuesday

842
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:53,640
and Wednesday. And it's only every other Tuesday for a little while. So not that long.

843
01:03:53,640 --> 01:03:57,680
Well also to make up though for my missing Tuesday nights I plan on occasionally doing

844
01:03:57,680 --> 01:04:01,680
That means you have to be listening late at the night.

845
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:03,680
That's right. So it'll be a good time. Good time.

846
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:06,680
All right, so lots of live stuff coming back to Orange House Radio soon.

847
01:04:06,680 --> 01:04:09,680
That should be fun. And Loki's still no show.

848
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:11,680
Don't look at me. I'm not...

849
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:14,680
I've got a fiancé that doesn't allow the...

850
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:16,680
We need to give her a show.

851
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:19,680
I need to friggin' play more Final Fantasy XI is what I need to do.

852
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:24,680
Let's get Nellie to fill in for the weeks that Dark Sakura's not here.

853
01:04:24,680 --> 01:04:28,080
I want you and Nelly to be guests on my show.

854
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:30,720
That'd be cool.

855
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:31,720
I'll be on your show.

856
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:32,720
Woo!

857
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:35,160
I'm going to have everybody on my show.

858
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:43,760
And we can have a Brazilian wax job show where we all wax each other.

859
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:47,280
Like, ooh, that looks so good.

860
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:48,280
That's okay.

861
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:49,280
Anyway.

862
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:50,280
Okay.

863
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:51,440
Bad idea.

864
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:54,480
So I want to talk about something now.

865
01:04:54,480 --> 01:05:00,840
last wax job? No, no, it's not sex related. Um... But they're not necessarily sexual.

866
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:07,600
I did something today. Uh oh! And... Do you need to be panked? What? Do you need to be

867
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:15,320
panked? Maybe. Um, it's kind of one of those things that I said I was never going to do.

868
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:22,160
Just get it out, man. Just, you have one life. Live it. But, I don't know, something happened

869
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:26,760
it's like you know I decided maybe I was being just a little too harsh and I

870
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:39,000
needed to open up my mind a little bit and your ass and my butt so I went and I

871
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:43,000
picked up World of Warcraft today

872
01:05:44,560 --> 01:05:48,720
let's hope that miklotov is not listening right now oh I already told

873
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:55,720
Let us know in the comments below and we will see you in the next video.

874
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:23,440
Skyler Crusade for you guys. Alliance. Alliance on Skyler Crusade. Play a Night Elf. I will

875
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:29,440
be near where you'll go. We'll see, we'll see. And then also I will be on wherever the

876
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:35,520
gay one is. I think it's P something. I want to play on the gay server. So, well then I'll

877
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:39,680
let you know which one that is. Okay. So, that's it. I'm on Warlord. I've already played

878
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:43,560
it. I played it a little bit before tonight's show. I was playing on. Isn't it so much better?

879
01:06:43,560 --> 01:06:47,720
No, it's just different. You can actually. I'm not going to say it's better because it's

880
01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:55,720
It's different. It actually reminded me a lot of Guild Wars, but I know that World of Warcraft came first, but it plays a lot, a lot like Guild Wars.

881
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:59,720
A lot, a lot like it. Why are you shaking your head disapprovingly, Loki?

882
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:07,720
Just, you know, going to another game that you won't play. Whatever. I'm sticking with one game that I won't play.

883
01:07:07,720 --> 01:07:12,640
No, I'm not leaving Final Fantasy XI, I'm not by any means cancel my account on Final

884
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:13,640
Fantasy XI.

885
01:07:13,640 --> 01:07:21,320
I just, I got to this point where I was like, I'm bored, and I don't want to be bored, and

886
01:07:21,320 --> 01:07:27,160
I feel like I'm, I don't have enough time to invest in the game, so, and I'm never going

887
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:32,800
to be able to participate in the way the game is set up in a lot of the end game events

888
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:34,520
because I have no time to play.

889
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:39,040
So I just wanted to find another game to fill casually my time, but I do have a lot of friends

890
01:07:39,040 --> 01:07:42,360
that still play Final Fantasy XI and I do plan on doing some things in it, just very

891
01:07:42,360 --> 01:07:43,520
limited.

892
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:44,520
For now.

893
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:45,520
For now.

894
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:46,520
While I test out World of Warcraft.

895
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:47,520
I don't know.

896
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:48,520
I may hate this game.

897
01:07:48,520 --> 01:07:49,860
I may play it for a month and then decide it sucks and I miss Final Fantasy XI.

898
01:07:49,860 --> 01:07:51,560
I completely understand.

899
01:07:51,560 --> 01:07:54,120
That's why I stopped feeding Taco.

900
01:07:54,120 --> 01:07:55,120
You're a Nintendonk.

901
01:07:55,120 --> 01:07:56,120
You know what?

902
01:07:56,120 --> 01:07:59,560
I've decided that when Dan and I get a dog, because I'm gonna get a dog, I'm gonna get

903
01:07:59,560 --> 01:08:02,880
a long-haired chihuahua and name it Taco for you.

904
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:06,840
I think that is the best name of the dog ever.

905
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:11,180
I'll take care of Taco.

906
01:08:11,180 --> 01:08:15,380
So that was my big secret. I finally caved.

907
01:08:15,380 --> 01:08:16,300
And I bought World of Warcraft.

908
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:20,640
It's alright. You'll just switch to the next big thing when World of Warcraft comes out.

909
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:25,000
I'll stick with Final Fantasy XI since I don't even know what's going on now.

910
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:28,120
And they've added another update and they're doing the

911
01:08:28,120 --> 01:08:31,940
launch of that Treasures of whatever the hell it's called that's going to be coming out

912
01:08:31,940 --> 01:08:35,200
again with... I do want to check that out. With more player classes and

913
01:08:35,200 --> 01:08:38,460
you know it's... I'm hoping that

914
01:08:38,460 --> 01:08:43,100
for... I know it's probably not going to happen. I'm hoping that the Xbox 360 version

915
01:08:43,100 --> 01:08:46,740
is on the same servers because then that could just, you know... It will be.

916
01:08:46,740 --> 01:08:50,980
Well I'm not sure about that because it might be on Xbox

917
01:08:50,980 --> 01:08:55,140
or Microsoft servers in which case, you know, then you won't be able to play with other people.

918
01:08:55,140 --> 01:08:58,300
If it is, then I can cancel my Play Online account

919
01:08:58,300 --> 01:09:03,820
And just play for my xbox live and they'll kind of cut down on costs a bit plus i'll be able to you know

920
01:09:04,220 --> 01:09:06,220
Have the game looking better

921
01:09:06,380 --> 01:09:10,620
We need katamari the and then the rpg that'd be badass

922
01:09:11,580 --> 01:09:13,580
That'd be weird

923
01:09:14,220 --> 01:09:17,500
I need to roll over the king. So that was it. That was my big secret

924
01:09:19,260 --> 01:09:21,260
Shane's not speaking to me now

925
01:09:21,580 --> 01:09:22,940
It's all right

926
01:09:22,940 --> 01:09:26,460
There's one thing I want to add about where the warcraft is. Um, I like how you can um,

927
01:09:26,460 --> 01:09:34,460
Go to UI sites and kind of customize the way you can cast your spells or whatever.

928
01:09:34,460 --> 01:09:36,460
I think that's really cool. You can't do that in Final Fantasy.

929
01:09:36,460 --> 01:09:38,460
Well, I guess you could.

930
01:09:38,460 --> 01:09:40,460
You have to set up a macro for it.

931
01:09:40,460 --> 01:09:47,460
I like that you don't have to play with people if you don't want to and you don't have to be the party bitch like I used to be.

932
01:09:47,460 --> 01:09:50,460
I know. They're different. I'm not going to compare the games.

933
01:09:50,460 --> 01:09:53,460
I like playing it through it because I can kick their ass into myself.

934
01:09:53,460 --> 01:09:59,460
I don't like chatting with people in chat rooms, but only to myself because talking with other people online is awful.

935
01:10:00,460 --> 01:10:06,460
No. There's a difference between talking to other people and then having to actually play with strangers.

936
01:10:06,460 --> 01:10:09,460
It's still interacting. Still the same argument.

937
01:10:09,460 --> 01:10:11,460
Do these strangers have candy? Because I like candy.

938
01:10:11,460 --> 01:10:12,460
Rob, I'm gonna get you.

939
01:10:12,460 --> 01:10:23,460
Rob, they showed us this really cool trailer sizzle reel, as they call them in the industry, for the movies coming out. They showed Strangers with Candy the movie. It looked freaking awesome.

940
01:10:23,460 --> 01:10:24,460
Oh, I can't wait.

941
01:10:24,460 --> 01:10:25,460
I can't wait.

942
01:10:25,460 --> 01:10:26,460
Can't wait.

943
01:10:26,460 --> 01:10:30,460
Extrovert, will you tell Shane to stop hating me? He's mad at me.

944
01:10:30,460 --> 01:10:31,460
Is he listening?

945
01:10:31,460 --> 01:10:32,460
Yeah.

946
01:10:32,460 --> 01:10:33,460
Oh.

947
01:10:33,460 --> 01:10:36,460
Shane, he's impulsive.

948
01:10:36,460 --> 01:10:37,460
You know.

949
01:10:37,460 --> 01:10:40,460
You were encouraging me.

950
01:10:40,460 --> 01:10:41,460
I think that...

951
01:10:41,460 --> 01:10:52,820
Well, yeah, I was unapologetically saying that, but it's like, I'm impulsive, too.

952
01:10:52,820 --> 01:10:58,300
And I'm not going to really probably play, I'm going to probably play your buddy pass,

953
01:10:58,300 --> 01:11:00,780
but I mean, that's going to be limited.

954
01:11:00,780 --> 01:11:03,500
I'm having a fun time with Final Fantasy XI right now.

955
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:06,740
I'm like really enjoying it, and I'm still a white mage.

956
01:11:06,740 --> 01:11:10,540
I mean, that's the weird part about it, is like, I've actually enjoyed-

957
01:11:10,540 --> 01:11:12,040
You're the party bitch, too, right?

958
01:11:12,040 --> 01:11:21,040
Yes, yes, I've been the party bitch, but, like, it's been actually okay, because I've been learning the skill of it all, and I'm 15 right now.

959
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:24,540
So, I mean, I'm kind of working at it, but it's going well.

960
01:11:26,540 --> 01:11:30,040
I got tired of being the party bitch, so I just let the ingrates die.

961
01:11:31,540 --> 01:11:34,540
I do that, too! In fact, I do-

962
01:11:34,540 --> 01:11:40,040
If they don't come running for the signal for the freaking party buff, fuck them. They don't get fucked.

963
01:11:40,040 --> 01:11:44,040
I'll delete. That's what I'm saying.

964
01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:47,040
They just don't get left.

965
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:49,040
Bitch, you weren't there.

966
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:52,040
I have the instant, you know, bad party remedy.

967
01:11:52,040 --> 01:11:56,040
It's wonderful having the cable modem right on my desk because I can just, boop.

968
01:11:56,040 --> 01:11:59,040
Look at that. My connection went down.

969
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:02,040
I wonder how that happened. Oh, the cord fell out.

970
01:12:02,040 --> 01:12:06,040
Oh, damn it. Oh, well.

971
01:12:06,040 --> 01:12:08,040
I guess I won't log back in.

972
01:12:08,040 --> 01:12:13,760
I'll never figure out how to put this cord back in until at least a couple days from

973
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:14,760
now.

974
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:15,760
Nope.

975
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:17,000
All right.

976
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:20,440

985
01:12:53,720 --> 01:12:59,540
Oh, random aside, Sakurina reminded me of something here. BeatMania2DX is actually in

986
01:12:59,540 --> 01:13:02,220
world of warcraft credits

but in the special bank section or something

01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:08,220

996
01:13:28,820 --> 01:13:31,520
Yes, uh, you probably already know where I've been this weekend.

997
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:33,320
Yes, you'd win to Digital Life, yes?

998
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:40,220
Yes, and I have so much, and I have some pretty, you know, I got, I got a lot of good shit that I, you know, that I have to say right now.

999
01:13:40,220 --> 01:13:41,120
Tell us, tell us.

1000
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:47,520
The starters, uh, the DDR tournament there, got shit, got, got coverage. It got shitloads of coverage, um...

1001
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:48,520
Like, what kind of coverage?

1002
01:13:48,520 --> 01:13:58,020
Uh, MTV was filming there, you know, yesterday, for a better part of, uh, the freestyle div- uh, freestyle division, and you wouldn't believe this.

1003
01:13:58,020 --> 01:14:06,020
NBC ended up filming a sitcom, part of an episode of the sitcom in the center stage after Freestyle.

1004
01:14:06,020 --> 01:14:08,020
What? What sitcom do you know?

1005
01:14:08,020 --> 01:14:14,020
I don't know, but it was just two white guys just dancing right there on a fifth mix.

1006
01:14:14,020 --> 01:14:17,020
The Drip Machine climax basic.

1007
01:14:17,020 --> 01:14:19,020
Like My Name is Ero or something?

1008
01:14:19,020 --> 01:14:25,020
I don't know, just two white guys dancing, yeah, doing like you got served thing on a DDR pad.

1009
01:14:25,020 --> 01:14:27,620
And they, yeah, they pretty much shot that scene there.

1010
01:14:27,620 --> 01:14:28,380
Should be interesting.

1011
01:14:28,380 --> 01:14:29,500
Were they both flamey?

1012
01:14:30,700 --> 01:14:32,780
No, Wailing, GDR's already been on Will and Grace.

1013
01:14:32,780 --> 01:14:33,340
Oh, it has?

1014
01:14:33,340 --> 01:14:33,780
Yes.

1015
01:14:33,780 --> 01:14:34,020
Oh.

1016
01:14:34,020 --> 01:14:41,900
Yeah, but, okay, I also got, I also might have to snag a few things from the, from the Red Octane booth, which was right next to the tournament area.

1017
01:14:42,500 --> 01:14:45,020
Behold, the link that I'm posting up right now.

1018
01:14:45,580 --> 01:14:49,860
I'm at, you wouldn't believe who I managed to meet, Kyle Ward, from In the Groove.

1019
01:14:51,540 --> 01:14:52,100
Hello?

1020
01:14:52,100 --> 01:14:56,300
Yeah, I mean, I was so shocked, I was speechless, Zaku.

1021
01:14:56,300 --> 01:15:00,300
Oh, what is this?

1022
01:15:05,300 --> 01:15:08,900
Zaku, I fucking love you. You just went up like a hundred points in my book.

1023
01:15:08,900 --> 01:15:12,100
What the fuck is that?

1024
01:15:12,100 --> 01:15:18,100
Zaku got the person who wrote all the songs in In The Groove to autograph something for us.

1025
01:15:18,100 --> 01:15:36,100
I'm gonna send that to you sometime this week. Just give me an address to send it to.

1026
01:15:36,100 --> 01:15:37,100
That is beautiful.

1027
01:15:37,100 --> 01:15:44,100
Also, I managed to play Guitar Hero this weekend. I managed to play Guitar Hero this weekend.

1028
01:15:44,100 --> 01:15:59,100
Um, just one word, it's really hard for beginners to pick up, since you literally not only have to hit the button, but you know, one of the buttons on the neck, but you also have to hit, you know, the little tab right there with the square there that makes up the strings.

1029
01:15:59,100 --> 01:16:06,100
Exactly, I can't contain myself, we're all looking at the pictures and I'm giggling and I can't stop laughing, this is the coolest thing ever.

1030
01:16:06,100 --> 01:16:12,060
okay but it's not as cool as well you know but it's basically not as cool as

1031
01:16:12,060 --> 01:16:16,900
this oh I had in the group two on a slim PS they had in the group two on running

1032
01:16:16,900 --> 01:16:24,340
on a ps2 okay after burn with red octane after burners that's cool okay so they

1033
01:16:24,340 --> 01:16:29,940
so how how is that well it's just the same thing I know I know Kyle Ward would

1034
01:16:29,940 --> 01:16:33,260
didn't want to say that much about when it was gonna be released all I know is

1035
01:16:33,260 --> 01:16:40,260
is that I saw In the Group 2 running on a PS2, and I got to play it on After Burners.

1036
01:16:40,260 --> 01:16:44,260
To be honest, though, In the Group 2 coming out on PS2 is kind of a duh.

1037
01:16:44,260 --> 01:16:46,260
I mean, we know it's going to happen at some point, but...

1038
01:16:46,260 --> 01:16:47,260
Loki?

1039
01:16:47,260 --> 01:16:49,260
Well, the thing, though, is that it...

1040
01:16:49,260 --> 01:16:54,260
That and they also had DDR Mario Mix, you know, playable over there.

1041
01:16:54,260 --> 01:16:55,260
Hold on, Loki has a dot.

1042
01:16:55,260 --> 01:16:59,260
It was a pretty long line trying to get through there.

1043
01:16:59,260 --> 01:17:06,260
If it's right off of Slim PS2, then that means it's not a beta kit, so that means it's probably done.

1044
01:17:06,260 --> 01:17:11,260
Yeah, it's probably a build. It's probably an early build. It had all the songs in it, though.

1045
01:17:11,260 --> 01:17:12,260
Interesting.

1046
01:17:12,260 --> 01:17:14,260
Yeah, I had it. Mm-hmm.

1047
01:17:14,260 --> 01:17:15,260
Okay, okay, so...

1048
01:17:15,260 --> 01:17:18,260
You know, I said before...

1049
01:17:18,260 --> 01:17:19,260
How was DDR with Mario?

1050
01:17:19,260 --> 01:17:20,260
Huh?

1051
01:17:20,260 --> 01:17:21,260
How was DDR with Mario?

1052
01:17:21,260 --> 01:17:28,260
I did get a chance to play it, but I saw folks, you know, because the lines were pretty big for that and I didn't have enough time.

1053
01:17:28,260 --> 01:17:36,020
But, you know, it looks like a regular DDR mix, except, you know, obviously it's a license.

1054
01:17:36,020 --> 01:17:37,520
Yeah, and it's way easier.

1055
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:42,160
That, and from what I hear, there's no mods on it.

1056
01:17:42,160 --> 01:17:44,520
You can't even pick speed mods on that mix.

1057
01:17:44,520 --> 01:17:45,520
Oh, I didn't know that.

1058
01:17:46,720 --> 01:17:48,820
Yeah, that's what I heard.

1059
01:17:48,820 --> 01:17:49,320
Hmm.

1060
01:17:49,620 --> 01:17:53,420
I don't know if it's true, and the only way to find out is by getting it.

1061
01:17:53,420 --> 01:17:55,720
Uh, let me see, what else can I say?

1062
01:17:55,720 --> 01:17:57,720
Xbox 360

1063
01:17:58,280 --> 01:18:00,960
Obviously, yeah, they were they did have some on display

1064
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:07,680
It wasn't that much free shit or to go around over there as well. I didn't ask to get an in the group to t-shirt

1065
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:17,560
Yeah, and that's it what did you do you did you do your did you do your tequila thing in the tournament register for?

1066
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:21,600
No, I didn't I didn't I didn't have the time for the money

1067
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:29,600
But as I said, you know, MTV got, you know, got plenty of coverage on yesterday.

1068
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:31,600
They were pretty much filming there.

1069
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:38,600
They were focusing on like two players that I know through DDR.

1070
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:42,600
And that's pretty much what I've seen.

1071
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:44,600
I'm trying to remember what else.

1072
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:46,600
Yeah, lots of Halo.

1073
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:47,600
All right.

1074
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:51,600
MTV is actually backing Guitar Hero officially.

1075
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:52,600
Who is?

1076
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:53,600
MTV.

1077
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:54,600
Really?

1078
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:55,600
Yeah.

1079
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:56,600
Interesting.

1080
01:18:56,600 --> 01:18:58,600
And like I said earlier, Gibson Guitars.

1081
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:01,600
That's going to be a pretty big music game, we'll see.

1082
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:02,600
Yeah.

1083
01:19:02,600 --> 01:19:09,600
Alright, Zaku, I can't thank you enough for getting Ka, or what is he called, Keel's call?

1084
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:11,600
I don't remember, he's called by both.

1085
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:14,600
Keel, thank you so much for getting him to autograph something saying that we brought.

1086
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:16,600
It's only fair, we were playing his music back that day.

1087
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:19,600
That is awesome, I'm so excited.

1088
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:22,600
Just give me an address and send it to me, I'll get it to you.

1089
01:19:22,600 --> 01:19:26,600
Look for a private message from me very soon, and we'll send you something from the private wallet exchange.

1090
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:27,600
Alright man.

1091
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:28,600
Okay?

1092
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:29,600
Alright man.

1093
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:30,600
Have a good one, thank you for calling.

1094
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:31,600
Alright, later.

1095
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:32,600
Later, bye.

1096
01:19:32,600 --> 01:19:36,600
That's too funny.

1097
01:19:36,600 --> 01:19:37,600
I'm sorry, that's great.

1098
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:43,600
At least it wasn't addressed to myself or DarkSakura, I mean, because that would have been even step up and funny.

1099
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:44,600
Still though, still though.

1100
01:19:44,600 --> 01:19:45,600
It's so cool.

1101
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:46,600
That's pretty funny.

1102
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:47,600
Yeah.

1103
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:48,600
All right.

1104
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:49,600
Let's go to another call.

1105
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:50,600
Hello.

1106
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:51,600
You're on Orange Launch Radio.

1107
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:52,600
Hi.

1108
01:19:52,600 --> 01:19:53,600
Sephiroth1215 here.

1109
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:54,600
Hello, Sephiroth1215.

1110
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:57,920
What's on your mind?

1111
01:19:57,920 --> 01:20:03,840
I have to say that I'm pretty pissed because I went to Digital Life today and missed everything.

1112
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:04,960
And missed everything?

1113
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:06,200
What happened?

1114
01:20:06,200 --> 01:20:07,200
Did everybody leave?

1115
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:08,200
No.

1116
01:20:08,200 --> 01:20:09,200
Today just sucked.

1117
01:20:09,200 --> 01:20:11,520
I mean, it was crowded.

1118
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:12,840
I couldn't play one game.

1119
01:20:12,840 --> 01:20:21,000
The only thing I was able to play was Guitar Hero once, and I got to play DDR with Mario.

1120
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:26,800
But otherwise, you couldn't even play in the DDR machines they had there, and all the good

1121
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:30,920
stuff they were giving away for free over at Red Octane were gone.

1122
01:20:30,920 --> 01:20:31,920
Wow.

1123
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:35,460
Well, they let anybody into digital life, right?

1124
01:20:35,460 --> 01:20:37,700
Pretty much, you don't have to be in the industry or anything, right?

1125
01:20:37,700 --> 01:20:40,160
You just get to go, pay your admission fee, right?

1126
01:20:40,160 --> 01:20:41,160
Yeah.

1127
01:20:41,160 --> 01:20:45,160
You probably got way, way more people than they were thinking?

1128
01:20:45,160 --> 01:20:48,160
Maybe. It was pretty crowded today.

1129
01:20:48,160 --> 01:20:51,160
Interesting. I wanted to get more people in E3, probably.

1130
01:20:51,160 --> 01:20:55,160
I really wanted to go, but I was stuck here in California,

1131
01:20:55,160 --> 01:21:00,160
unable to get some time off to come out there, or I should say fly out there.

1132
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:04,160
Did you observe anything else that was cool?

1133
01:21:04,160 --> 01:21:08,160
I took a while to look at the finals of the DDR tournament, which was okay,

1134
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:13,800
went by really, really slow. Because every time people went up and they got off, they

1135
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:20,080
had to fix the machine again. Wow. It took a long time. But a friend of mine actually

1136
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:28,360
won a free DDR rental machine. What, like won a machine? Well, to rent. Oh. So like

1137
01:21:28,360 --> 01:21:33,840
for his next house party, he can get a free DDR machine for the party? Yeah, pretty much.

1138
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:38,480
she wants to run a tournament for himself. That's kind of cool, I guess. I'd probably

1139
01:21:38,480 --> 01:21:42,560
do something similar. I've always wanted to get a DDR machine on the back of a truck and

1140
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:48,560
go driving around town having a tournament on the back of the truck. I don't like that.

1141
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:56,740
How long can you stand up? I'm sorry, what? When it came to other games, though, the whole

1142
01:21:56,740 --> 01:22:04,380
thing was just full of Xboxes. Like, I found a few PS2s and, like, two Gamecubes. But,

1143
01:22:04,380 --> 01:22:08,740
otherwise, they're all mainly games I didn't really care too much about. And even the old

1144
01:22:08,740 --> 01:22:12,180
games, they have big lines for them that are even out right now.

1145
01:22:12,180 --> 01:22:18,540
Wow. But the 360 preview wasn't too bad. I mean,

1146
01:22:18,540 --> 01:22:28,540
I mean, they showed a lot of the most recent, I guess, more than where you can see D3, I don't know, but...

1147
01:22:28,540 --> 01:22:41,540
Anyways, a real quick segue here. What you're talking about, like the DDR tournament on the back of a truck, there might be of the Jackass sketch where they were doing roller disco in the back of a van, and they were driving it around like a moving van.

1148
01:22:41,540 --> 01:22:48,540
That's pretty funny, so I guess it could work.

1149
01:22:48,540 --> 01:22:53,540
I'd want to rent a DDR machine and drop that off a building and see what happens.

1150
01:22:53,540 --> 01:22:56,540
Like, you know how Letterman always does that on his show, like he throws things off a building to see what happens?

1151
01:22:56,540 --> 01:22:59,540
I want to rent a DDR machine to throw it off a building and see what happens.

1152
01:22:59,540 --> 01:23:01,540
That'd be pretty cool.

1153
01:23:01,540 --> 01:23:06,540
Anyway, sorry for that aside there, we just had to get that out of our system.

1154
01:23:06,540 --> 01:23:10,580
So are you going to be interested in picking up an Xbox 360 based on what you saw today?

1155
01:23:10,580 --> 01:23:14,100
I was already going to get one anyway because I always

1156
01:23:14,100 --> 01:23:19,180
just get the systems no matter what so I don't even care too much about the Xbox but

1157
01:23:19,180 --> 01:23:19,540
there's

1158
01:23:19,540 --> 01:23:24,220
always games that come out specifically for it. You know there's going to be some

1159
01:23:24,220 --> 01:23:25,820
DDR UltraMix

1160
01:23:25,820 --> 01:23:29,220
360 or something I think it's inevitable that we get something like that and

1161
01:23:29,220 --> 01:23:32,180
that'll be like the must-have game of next year or the year after

1162
01:23:32,180 --> 01:23:40,300
Yeah, sure. But, otherwise, they didn't have a lot of DS games to play. There was Mario

1163
01:23:40,300 --> 01:23:45,540
Kart and Animal Crossing. I heard they were demoing the Wi-Fi thing a little more, because

1164
01:23:45,540 --> 01:23:51,780
I saw some pictures on the internet of that. I didn't really get to play any of it, because

1165
01:23:51,780 --> 01:23:55,620
there was big lines for it, so I just went over to DDR with Mario, which actually had

1166
01:23:55,620 --> 01:24:01,460
no line. Surprise, surprise, no line for DDR with Mario. What did you think of it?

1167
01:24:01,460 --> 01:24:11,420
It was easy, but I mean, I put on whatever I could to make it harder, and she told me

1168
01:24:11,420 --> 01:24:18,100
to put on something where you get bomboms on top of the screen, and you have to hit

1169
01:24:18,100 --> 01:24:24,420
the potobos to make sure the bomboms don't blow up, which can be a little bit harder

1170
01:24:24,420 --> 01:24:30,500
only because the potobos come pretty quickly, but it wasn't too bad.

1171
01:24:30,500 --> 01:24:37,740
Um, otherwise, what I thought was interesting there is they had a setup for Para Para on...

1172
01:24:37,740 --> 01:24:39,020
What?

1173
01:24:39,020 --> 01:24:46,860
Yes, um, by the DDR machines, but it was off. All I saw was the Para Para controllers, and it just says Para Para on there.

1174
01:24:46,860 --> 01:24:50,900
Like, for PlayStation 2, or for the arcade?

1175
01:24:50,900 --> 01:24:51,900
The console version.

1176
01:24:51,900 --> 01:24:57,940
Why would they bring that here? They've got no plans to release that here, as far as I know. That's weird.

1177
01:24:57,940 --> 01:25:01,680
I don't know, they couldn't release that here. Nobody would get it.

1178
01:25:01,680 --> 01:25:03,540
Nobody would get it.

1179
01:25:03,540 --> 01:25:07,760
There'd be like five people that would buy it, and they're the hardcore Para Para fans. Nobody else would get it.

1180
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:12,880
It's released, um, US pioneers are releasing Para Para All Stars.

1181
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:13,380
Really?

1182
01:25:13,380 --> 01:25:16,620
Uh, they just released the, uh, soundtrack.

1183
01:25:16,620 --> 01:25:18,840
Interesting. Hmm. Okay, well,

1184
01:25:18,840 --> 01:25:23,580
maybe there's, I don't know, maybe just some kid brought it from home to let everybody play.

1185
01:25:23,580 --> 01:25:25,100
I don't know, that's weird.

1186
01:25:25,100 --> 01:25:26,400
That is very weird.

1187
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:29,460
But it wasn't on.

1188
01:25:29,460 --> 01:25:32,780
Anything else you want to share with us?

1189
01:25:32,780 --> 01:25:36,020
Not really. I was fairly impressed with Guitar Hero, though.

1190
01:25:36,020 --> 01:25:39,420
I played one of the

1191
01:25:39,420 --> 01:25:43,180
second easiest kind of songs.

1192
01:25:43,180 --> 01:25:46,680
I mean, it took me a second to learn, but otherwise, it wasn't too bad.

1193
01:25:46,680 --> 01:25:50,220
Yeah, we're getting a lot of good early feedback on that, so it should be a good game.

1194
01:25:50,220 --> 01:25:53,680
Did it feel like Amplitude? Have you played Amplitude and

1195
01:25:53,680 --> 01:25:55,920
frequency, did it feel like those games to you?

1196
01:25:55,920 --> 01:25:59,160
Yeah, actually it was pretty similar to that.

1197
01:25:59,160 --> 01:26:02,840
Same way, same setup and everything.

1198
01:26:02,840 --> 01:26:06,960
Very cool. It's just that with, I don't know, guitar.

1199
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:08,480
Okay, that works.

1200
01:26:08,480 --> 01:26:12,400
Alright, well we're going to go ahead and let you go so we can get to some other calls, but thanks for calling in, okay?

1201
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:15,960
Glad to hear you had a good time at the show, even though everything was very crowded and

1202
01:26:15,960 --> 01:26:20,320
you didn't get to play too much, but at least you got to see a lot of cool stuff.

1203
01:26:20,320 --> 01:26:21,320
Yeah, yeah, it wasn't bad.

1204
01:26:21,320 --> 01:26:22,320
Alright.

1205
01:26:22,320 --> 01:26:23,320
Alright.

1206
01:26:23,320 --> 01:26:24,320
Alright, take care.

1207
01:26:24,320 --> 01:26:25,320
Thank you.

1208
01:26:25,320 --> 01:26:26,320
Later.

1209
01:26:26,320 --> 01:26:28,320
Uh, let's go to one more call.

1210
01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:30,320
Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio.

1211
01:26:30,320 --> 01:26:31,320
Hey, hey, hey, it's Ronchon.

1212
01:26:31,320 --> 01:26:32,320
Hi, Ronchon.

1213
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:33,320
How are you?

1214
01:26:33,320 --> 01:26:34,320
Hi, Ron.

1215
01:26:34,320 --> 01:26:35,320
Hey, what's up, people?

1216
01:26:35,320 --> 01:26:36,320
Hey.

1217
01:26:36,320 --> 01:26:37,320
Hey.

1218
01:26:37,320 --> 01:26:38,320
Hey, you wanna hear a joke?

1219
01:26:38,320 --> 01:26:39,320
Yeah, yeah.

1220
01:26:39,320 --> 01:26:40,320
Okay.

1221
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:41,320
What do gay horses eat?

1222
01:26:41,320 --> 01:26:42,320
Hey.

1223
01:26:42,320 --> 01:26:43,320
Hey.

1224
01:26:43,320 --> 01:26:44,320
Hey.

1225
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:45,320
Sorry, anyway.

1226
01:26:45,320 --> 01:26:52,320
The funny thing you've mentioned is that it has something to do with the con I went to this past weekend.

1227
01:26:52,320 --> 01:26:53,320
Oh really?

1228
01:26:53,320 --> 01:26:58,320
Yes, we have what was called Anna Fest, which is like a girl's celebration type convention.

1229
01:26:58,320 --> 01:27:01,320
So, yaoi con without the yaoi?

1230
01:27:01,320 --> 01:27:03,320
Yeah.

1231
01:27:03,320 --> 01:27:07,320
They were actually showing American animation at the con.

1232
01:27:07,320 --> 01:27:11,320
Uh, sounds like total shoujo day.

1233
01:27:11,320 --> 01:27:19,320
There was actually a shoujo-kan, but that, well that's it for another story. But anywho, I was in charge of the masquerade. I had no staffers.

1234
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:25,320
Okay, so what did you do? What was your responsibility?

1235
01:27:26,320 --> 01:27:28,320
I was in charge of the masquerade and the karaoke.

1236
01:27:28,320 --> 01:27:42,320
The whole weekend I got screamed at by the contract because stuff was not running properly. I was missing stuff. I was missing that. I didn't even know I was missing anything. I didn't even unpack half the stuff that we needed.

1237
01:27:42,320 --> 01:27:51,320
It was just crazy. It was a Saturday, Sunday, Monday convention.

1238
01:27:51,320 --> 01:27:54,320
Why do you have a convention on a Monday? Was Monday a holiday or something?

1239
01:27:54,320 --> 01:28:10,320
I tried to tell them to go Friday, Saturday, Sunday, but they wouldn't want to listen to me. I guess I haven't been to enough cons to know better.

1240
01:28:10,320 --> 01:28:13,320
So what was the highlight of the con?

1241
01:28:13,320 --> 01:28:19,320
The masquerade. Overall, everybody said the con sucked as a whole, but they loved the masquerade.

1242
01:28:19,320 --> 01:28:25,320
Especially the Power of Power skit that was done by my friends. They did Go Godzilla Go.

1243
01:28:25,320 --> 01:28:27,320
Oh, God. What did they do?

1244
01:28:27,320 --> 01:28:38,320
They did the whole Power of Power dance to it. Plus, they had one of our friends with Godzilla in the background, raising their arms back and forth.

1245
01:28:38,320 --> 01:28:43,320
Rancha, I want to go to an anime con with you.

1246
01:28:43,320 --> 01:28:46,320
I'm telling you, fine, in May 2007, I'm shooting for-

1247
01:28:46,320 --> 01:28:49,320
I have an idea for a skit.

1248
01:28:49,320 --> 01:28:50,320
Uh-oh.

1249
01:28:50,320 --> 01:28:59,320
I want to have a bunch of people do Lodos War cross-play, and then do the D&D Satan's Game thing.

1250
01:28:59,320 --> 01:29:03,320
What's the con on the East Coast you're trying to get us to come to next year?

1251
01:29:03,320 --> 01:29:04,320
Katakana.

1252
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:06,320
Katakana, when's that?

1253
01:29:06,320 --> 01:29:10,820
It's, uh, first or second weekend of February. I have to post information about that in my journal.

1254
01:29:10,820 --> 01:29:11,320
Yeah, definitely.

1255
01:29:11,320 --> 01:29:12,820
You send me a plane ticket, I'll be there.

1256
01:29:12,820 --> 01:29:19,320
I, I may, I may just come because I want to go to the East Coast. Anyway, so I may take some time off to go, so we'll see.

1257
01:29:19,320 --> 01:29:20,820
Give me, definitely give me the details.

1258
01:29:20,820 --> 01:29:23,320
Yeah, I already put you down in my room for the sweep.

1259
01:29:23,320 --> 01:29:24,820
Woo!

1260
01:29:24,820 --> 01:29:26,820
I'll, I'll try to go.

1261
01:29:26,820 --> 01:29:27,820
Sweep.

1262
01:29:27,820 --> 01:29:30,320
And I'll try to bring the bike in costume.

1263
01:29:30,320 --> 01:29:39,320
Nice, because one of my friends, she runs like a giant Guilty Gear cosplay. She has like multiple Kai costumes.

1264
01:29:39,320 --> 01:29:43,320
I don't know shit about anime, which you'll find out at a convention.

1265
01:29:43,320 --> 01:29:45,320
I think that Rob should cosplay fast.

1266
01:29:45,320 --> 01:29:49,320
But I will game geek it up with anybody.

1267
01:29:49,320 --> 01:29:52,320
Rob, we're going to make you a costume. We're going to have you cosplay fast.

1268
01:29:52,320 --> 01:29:55,320
I want to cosplay as a slime from Dragon Quest.

1269
01:29:55,320 --> 01:29:56,320
I want Benimaru.

1270
01:29:56,320 --> 01:29:58,320
No, I don't think... Rob doesn't have...

1271
01:29:58,320 --> 01:30:00,320
I don't have the abs for that.

1272
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:05,320
But I think that Rob would make a perfect Faust if there's a Guilty Gear cosplay group.

1273
01:30:05,320 --> 01:30:12,320
We should totally imitate the guys who do the same thing at AX every year and have the Shin Sangumi running around.

1274
01:30:12,320 --> 01:30:16,320
See, on the East Coast, we don't have that. We have T-Shirt Ninjas running around.

1275
01:30:16,320 --> 01:30:22,320
T-Shirt Ninjas. Fun. No, no, no, no. We need the Turks this year.

1276
01:30:22,320 --> 01:30:25,880
Well, I will I will definitely be planning on trying to come to that con

1277
01:30:25,880 --> 01:30:29,520
So any of our East Coast listeners, I want them to go to so I can meet everybody at once

1278
01:30:30,200 --> 01:30:31,800
speaking of the Turks

1279
01:30:31,800 --> 01:30:38,800
Capticon we're having a massive Advent Children all group and I am crying about it because I saw all the details for Barrett

1280
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:42,560
And what happened

1281
01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:49,480
I'm I shit my pants after seeing that gun arm. I'm screaming. I have to make that I have to make that

1282
01:30:49,480 --> 01:30:57,480
You know what? It's entirely possible. Just do the metal arm.

1283
01:30:57,480 --> 01:31:04,480
I think I'll probably stick with the same material I made my original gun arm with, which was PVC.

1284
01:31:04,480 --> 01:31:08,480
For those that don't know where Katsucon is, where is it? Because our chat room is yelling at me.

1285
01:31:08,480 --> 01:31:10,480
It's Washington, D.C.

1286
01:31:10,480 --> 01:31:14,480
This means I have to starve myself for four months if I were to do Tifa.

1287
01:31:14,480 --> 01:31:16,480
I can stand to go to Washington, D.C.

1288
01:31:16,480 --> 01:31:19,480
It's Washington, D.C., the Omni-Shiram Hotel.

1289
01:31:19,480 --> 01:31:20,480
I'll play Marlene.

1290
01:31:20,480 --> 01:31:22,480
All right, I'm saving my money right now.

1291
01:31:22,480 --> 01:31:23,480
Sweet.

1292
01:31:23,480 --> 01:31:24,480
All right.

1293
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:29,480
And the fact to honor the funniest thing about it, everybody was saying that the con was so gay, and my response was,

1294
01:31:29,480 --> 01:31:32,480
Well, what do you expect? It was run by a bulldog dyke.

1295
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:34,480
How kind is that?

1296
01:31:34,480 --> 01:31:36,480
I should teach you not.

1297
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:40,480
People were saying that the con was so gay, and he says, What do you expect? It was run by a bulldog dyke.

1298
01:31:40,480 --> 01:31:48,480
She's running around with this long-ass mullet, and she has the Qui-Gon Jim braid too. I said Star Wars fans would lynch her for that.

1299
01:31:51,480 --> 01:31:53,480
I'll have to find a way there. I will have to find a way.

1300
01:31:53,480 --> 01:31:56,480
Alright, Ron-chan, we gotta let you go, because we got more show to do, but thanks for the-

1301
01:31:56,480 --> 01:32:00,480
I'm gonna start a PayPal collection, send Dark Sakura to the East Coast.

1302
01:32:00,480 --> 01:32:01,480
Alright.

1303
01:32:01,480 --> 01:32:05,480
Oh, Jamie, I have a link to send you later. It's a chart of all the Ron Milhapp soundtracks.

1304
01:32:05,480 --> 01:32:08,480
Ooh! Just email that to me.

1305
01:32:08,480 --> 01:32:09,480
Of course I will.

1306
01:32:09,480 --> 01:32:13,480
Have fun, you anime nerds.

1307
01:32:13,480 --> 01:32:17,480
You shouldn't talk. Bye.

1308
01:32:17,480 --> 01:32:21,480
I shouldn't talk. I'm on the radio talking about video games.

1309
01:32:21,480 --> 01:32:25,480
But to be fair, I also talk about sex.

1310
01:32:25,480 --> 01:32:29,480
That's true. Please shuffle.

1311
01:32:29,480 --> 01:32:35,480
Let's go to a break, kids. We gotta go to a break because when we come back from the break, we're gonna get into the cage match and some other little things.

1312
01:32:35,480 --> 01:32:38,520
I do want to take a couple more Skype calls if we have time. I know there's some more

1313
01:32:38,520 --> 01:32:41,520
people that want to get through, so I want to entertain that, but we have our regular

1314
01:32:41,520 --> 01:32:45,920
segments we definitely have to get through first. So we're going to go to a break, and

1315
01:32:45,920 --> 01:32:51,080
in this break I figure we'll start it off with, how about something from EX2? We haven't

1316
01:32:51,080 --> 01:32:55,240
played some EX2 stuff in a while. Actually, that's probably not true. I know we played

1317
01:32:55,240 --> 01:32:58,280
some last week, but you know, I want to hear some EX2 stuff.

1318
01:32:58,280 --> 01:33:01,920
Just play the music. That's right, we're going to play the music.

1319
01:33:01,920 --> 01:33:04,920
Let's start it off with a little bit of Sneaker Pimps.

1320
01:33:04,920 --> 01:33:06,920
We'll be back after this, kids, with more Orange Launch Radio.

1321
01:33:34,920 --> 01:33:48,860
Spin spin sugar, crawl home to me Spin spin sugar, spin for me

1322
01:33:48,860 --> 01:34:00,820
Spin spin sugar, twist for me Spin spin sugar

1323
01:34:30,820 --> 01:34:46,820
Why don't we just finish it all?

1324
01:36:30,820 --> 01:36:32,820
You

1325
01:37:00,820 --> 01:37:02,820
Oh

1326
01:38:00,820 --> 01:38:04,820
It's right outside of my eyes

1327
01:38:04,820 --> 01:38:07,820
It's not my job

1328
01:38:07,820 --> 01:38:10,820
To pretend this is love

1329
01:38:10,820 --> 01:38:13,820
It's not my duty

1330
01:38:13,820 --> 01:38:17,820
To give me something more

1331
01:38:17,820 --> 01:38:19,820
I'm not alone, I'm not alone

1332
01:40:17,820 --> 01:40:46,500
We are back on Orange Lounge Radio.

1333
01:40:46,500 --> 01:40:52,840
this episode 160 a nice round number there that's 8 times 20 so nine episodes

1334
01:40:52,840 --> 01:40:57,520

1335
01:40:57,520 --> 01:41:02,440

1336
01:41:02,440 --> 01:41:06,840

1338
01:41:14,840 --> 01:41:20,520
We need to get the Orange Lounge madam back here because she's great on episode 69 so

1339
01:41:20,520 --> 01:41:21,520
we need to get her back.

1340
01:41:21,520 --> 01:41:22,520
I'm Ms. Tixie Dust.

1341
01:41:22,520 --> 01:41:23,520
All right.

1342
01:41:23,520 --> 01:41:24,520
I'm Ms. Tixie Dust.

1343
01:41:24,520 --> 01:41:25,520
Yep.

1344
01:41:25,520 --> 01:41:26,520
We'll have to get her back here for 169.

1345
01:41:26,520 --> 01:41:27,520
So we'll see what happens.

1346
01:41:27,520 --> 01:41:33,960
I want to talk about this story before we get into the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match.

1347
01:41:33,960 --> 01:41:37,160
Yes, we will get back to the Skyline a little bit later with any time we have left in the

1348
01:41:37,160 --> 01:41:39,940
show at the end because I know there's folks who want to get through, but I have to bring

1349
01:41:39,940 --> 01:41:43,600
this up because this is very interesting and this is DDR related.

1350
01:41:43,600 --> 01:41:51,320
24 Hour Fitness, the really big gym club that you don't go to, they actually made a deal

1351
01:41:51,320 --> 01:41:56,620
with Konami and they're going to be incorporating Dance Dance Revolution arcade machines in

1352
01:41:56,620 --> 01:42:00,280
the kids clubs portion of 24 Hour Fitness.

1353
01:42:00,280 --> 01:42:06,420
In return, Konami is going to put a 30 day pass into the gym in the game.

1354
01:42:06,420 --> 01:42:09,680
So like when you buy a copy of DDR, you're going to get a free 30 day pass for 24 Hour

1355
01:42:09,680 --> 01:42:10,680
Fitness.

1356
01:42:10,680 --> 01:42:14,540
um... let's see uh... konami director of business partnerships

1357
01:42:14,540 --> 01:42:16,040
clara gilbert said

1358
01:42:16,040 --> 01:42:19,020
bringing the health and fitness benefits of the art of twenty four our fitness is

1359
01:42:19,020 --> 01:42:20,480
an unbeatable combination

1360
01:42:20,480 --> 01:42:24,200
and helping kids and adults stay in shape while having fun by placing ddr

1361
01:42:24,200 --> 01:42:25,760
twenty-four fitness locations

1362
01:42:25,760 --> 01:42:28,600
we strive to help kids and adults achieve their fitness goals

1363
01:42:28,600 --> 01:42:30,440
in an unintimidating and fun way

1364
01:42:30,440 --> 01:42:34,280
i didn't know that kids go to twenty four hour fitness i thought that just

1365
01:42:34,280 --> 01:42:37,400
closeted married men go there

1366
01:42:37,400 --> 01:42:41,900
And then they just, they should have fuck fuck resolution, resolution, revolution.

1367
01:42:41,900 --> 01:42:43,400
And then remember dance, dance, fuck.

1368
01:42:43,400 --> 01:42:46,400
It's fun for the whole family, is the idea, Exeterfer.

1369
01:42:46,400 --> 01:42:48,400
Or gay married men.

1370
01:42:51,400 --> 01:42:52,400
I don't think that's...

1371
01:42:52,400 --> 01:42:55,400
Or gay married men.

1372
01:42:55,400 --> 01:42:57,400
They're not going to put this in every 24 hours.

1373
01:42:57,400 --> 01:42:59,400
Gay men can't get married, silly.

1374
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:02,900
Yes they can.

1375
01:43:02,900 --> 01:43:04,400
The married kind can.

1376
01:43:04,400 --> 01:43:11,400
Anyway, I just kind of want to point out, what do you guys think? Good idea? Bad idea?

1377
01:43:11,400 --> 01:43:14,400
DarkSakura, you're a gym-going member here. What do you think?

1378
01:43:14,400 --> 01:43:16,400
It should go to California Family Fitness.

1379
01:43:16,400 --> 01:43:18,400
California Family Fitness isn't nationwide.

1380
01:43:18,400 --> 01:43:21,400
So, it should go to California Family Fitness.

1381
01:43:21,400 --> 01:43:24,400
Well, they could sign a deal too, maybe. I don't know. Probably not.

1382
01:43:24,400 --> 01:43:26,400
So that I can play DDR at my gym.

1383
01:43:26,400 --> 01:43:29,400
But you can play DDR at home.

1384
01:43:29,400 --> 01:43:32,400
You know, I miss good idea, bad idea.

1385
01:43:32,400 --> 01:43:37,640
okay how's the greatest well is there something you want to say about this

1386
01:43:37,640 --> 01:43:45,240
good idea bad idea wise good idea putting DDR in the gyms bad idea the

1387
01:43:45,240 --> 01:43:50,480
only DTR they're gonna be able to put in the gyms is DDR USA not necessarily no

1388
01:43:50,480 --> 01:43:55,160
the machines they're not over here they're not supposed to be here you know

1389
01:43:55,160 --> 01:43:58,760
you know they'll be extreme deny everything you know maybe they'll make a

1390
01:43:58,760 --> 01:44:04,480
a new DDR? Right. I know, right. But what about that thing that they were testing? Remember

1391
01:44:04,480 --> 01:44:10,120
a while back they were testing something for gyms? True, it was supposed to be like a,

1392
01:44:10,120 --> 01:44:13,000
it had like karate kicks in it and stuff. I don't remember what was in it. It was like

1393
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:16,600
a multi-person DDR thing and I don't think it was for kids, but maybe it's something

1394
01:44:16,600 --> 01:44:23,000
like that. Maybe it's a special DDR. What if the new DDR wasn't for arcades but for

1395
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:27,440
24-hour fitness? Wouldn't that be hilarious? We need Para Para in the gym because that's

1396
01:44:27,440 --> 01:44:29,440
That's a better workout, I think.

1397
01:44:29,440 --> 01:44:39,880
I'm telling you, fuck, fuck Revolution, and it's going to be in the showers, and all the

1398
01:44:39,880 --> 01:44:42,640
closeted gay guys are going to be all on that.

1399
01:44:42,640 --> 01:44:43,640
Drop the soap, Revolution.

1400
01:44:43,640 --> 01:44:46,120
They're going to be all on that.

1401
01:44:46,120 --> 01:44:47,120
Thank you for sharing, Extrovert.

1402
01:44:47,120 --> 01:44:48,120
Oh, no problem.

1403
01:44:48,120 --> 01:44:51,120
That's what it was called, DDR Studio.

1404
01:44:51,120 --> 01:44:54,440
Somebody mentioned that.

1405
01:44:54,440 --> 01:44:58,440
take one of the playstation 2 games and just put it in the cabinet what if they just did that what

1406
01:44:58,440 --> 01:45:05,880
do you think of that loki huh crap crap what if it was extreme 2 extreme 2 is pretty cool

1407
01:45:08,200 --> 01:45:14,520
it would work why not it has to do any build they could how easily would it be deported

1408
01:45:15,480 --> 01:45:20,040
extremely why don't they do it then they could do it lazy you might do it i still stand by

1409
01:45:20,040 --> 01:45:23,960
pada pada in the gym aren't they gonna have to edit the game somehow to put like the 24 hour

1410
01:45:23,960 --> 01:45:28,680
fitness logo in it possibly so while they're at it they can change all the

1411
01:45:28,680 --> 01:45:32,040
songs and stuff I guess I bet you this will be some type of special machine

1412
01:45:32,040 --> 01:45:36,560
just you wait no I want to ask you something real quick Loki because this

1413
01:45:36,560 --> 01:45:39,600
is on another subject something that's been going around on the DDR forums

1414
01:45:39,600 --> 01:45:43,480
what's the last you've heard on a release date for Ultramix 3 because some

1415
01:45:43,480 --> 01:45:47,240
people are saying it's been bumped back from the second it would never was on

1416
01:45:47,240 --> 01:45:50,680
the second oh I don't know you posted some news article on the website said it

1417
01:45:50,680 --> 01:45:56,560
was on a second. That was a while ago. No, it's like on the, I want to say it's the second week, I think.

1418
01:45:56,560 --> 01:46:01,520
Not like a push back a week. I mean, I can't remember if it was the second or

1419
01:46:01,520 --> 01:46:04,320
third week. Everything's in the third week. I mean, there's like 100 games

1420
01:46:04,320 --> 01:46:09,840
coming out in the third week. It's just retarded. But, yeah, if anything, I got

1421
01:46:09,840 --> 01:46:14,160
pushed back only a week or two. And it was, I think, relatively around the same

1422
01:46:14,160 --> 01:46:17,280
amount. I think some folks are saying the 16th now, like two weeks later. It would

1423
01:46:17,280 --> 01:46:22,280
That makes sense. Everything's coming out on the 16th. Everything. I mean, just too many games.

1424
01:46:22,280 --> 01:46:29,280
I can confirm that because of the tournament that we're working on that I have had no time to work on.

1425
01:46:29,280 --> 01:46:34,280
Okay. Very interesting. I just wanted to clear that up because I know it was on some web forums and I was like,

1426
01:46:34,280 --> 01:46:37,280
well, Loki did say that like five months ago, so it might be different now.

1427
01:46:37,280 --> 01:46:40,280
It was a while ago. Of course they're going to move the date around.

1428
01:46:40,280 --> 01:46:45,280
I haven't updated on every single thing I hear about, you know, so.

1429
01:46:45,280 --> 01:46:48,920
you might want to post a little update to our thing. Well, I don't want to, like, update

1430
01:46:48,920 --> 01:46:52,640
it. Okay, yeah, now it's coming out this day. For all those people waiting for Advent Children

1431
01:46:52,640 --> 01:47:03,720
at the end of January now, so. Yeah. All right. Let's go to the cage match. You guys ready

1432
01:47:03,720 --> 01:47:10,840
for this? Yeah, because I actually kept my promise. Goody, goody, goody. I'm so excited.

1433
01:47:10,840 --> 01:47:17,840
Okay, in the meantime, while I'm setting up CAGEMATCH, Dark Soccer, why don't you plug some of the other great programming we have here on Orange Launch Radio.

1434
01:47:17,840 --> 01:47:20,840
You mean Pump of the Volume, which is every other week?

1435
01:47:20,840 --> 01:47:21,840
Yes.

1436
01:47:21,840 --> 01:47:31,840
This is me on Tuesdays, Pump of the Volume, where I play whatever I really want to play and request if people actually decide to request them for a change.

1437
01:47:31,840 --> 01:47:33,840
I usually end up playing lots of Blur.

1438
01:47:33,840 --> 01:47:41,840
Last week, I did the Danger Doom CD, which I actually had for our pre-show today.

1439
01:47:41,840 --> 01:47:45,840
And coming up, we have Extra First Case of the Mondays.

1440
01:47:45,840 --> 01:47:49,840
And aren't we supposed to do a fuck-off show?

1441
01:47:49,840 --> 01:47:52,840
Like, weren't we supposed to do that? But it was too late.

1442
01:47:52,840 --> 01:47:53,840
We need to do a fuck-off show.

1443
01:47:53,840 --> 01:47:56,840
Yeah, that would be really cool. What is the fuck-off show?

1444
01:47:56,840 --> 01:48:00,840
That's when we get really bored and just randomly do shows.

1445
01:48:00,840 --> 01:48:02,840
Come off the air and just fuck off.

1446
01:48:02,840 --> 01:48:06,840
I want a fuck on show.

1447
01:48:06,840 --> 01:48:10,840
Fuck on, fuck off, the fucker.

1448
01:48:10,840 --> 01:48:12,840
Alright, you guys ready for tonight's Cage Match?

1449
01:48:12,840 --> 01:48:14,840
Oh, I don't know Rob Roberts, are we?

1450
01:48:14,840 --> 01:48:15,840
I think we are.

1451
01:48:15,840 --> 01:48:16,840
Okay.

1452
01:48:16,840 --> 01:48:20,840
The way the Cage Match works, we're going to play three songs for you guys.

1453
01:48:20,840 --> 01:48:23,840
Last week's winner and two brand new songs, as chosen by our hosts.

1454
01:48:23,840 --> 01:48:25,840
And you're going to vote for your favorite.

1455
01:48:25,840 --> 01:48:29,840
And the winning song goes into rotation all week long here on Orange Lounge Radio's

1456
01:48:29,840 --> 01:48:59,660
The song is called Hold Your Color by Pendulum and it's song number 1 tonight.

1457
01:48:59,660 --> 01:49:22,980
And we're gonna roll back thekun flirtatious Kristin

1458
01:49:22,980 --> 01:49:24,980
Don't give up

1459
01:49:24,980 --> 01:49:29,980
Don't you curse against the law

1460
01:49:29,980 --> 01:49:35,980
When they take everything away

1461
01:49:35,980 --> 01:49:43,980
Don't you curse against the law

1462
01:49:43,980 --> 01:50:10,980
I keep looking into your eyes

1463
01:50:10,980 --> 01:50:13,980
And so I lay beneath

1464
01:50:13,980 --> 01:50:16,980
Don't try to save yourself

1465
01:50:16,980 --> 01:50:19,980
The circle is gonna reach

1466
01:50:19,980 --> 01:50:23,980
Reaching out as you dig

1467
01:50:23,980 --> 01:50:28,980
Nothing else can touch me

1468
01:50:28,980 --> 01:50:31,980
So can I

1469
01:50:31,980 --> 01:50:35,980
Two guns against the wall

1470
01:50:35,980 --> 01:50:41,980
And they take everything away

1471
01:50:41,980 --> 01:50:47,980
Come with your colors, you can't do it

1472
01:51:11,980 --> 01:51:18,980
We have, also from the Hold Your Color album by Pendulum, track 2, which is, um, or actually,

1473
01:51:18,980 --> 01:51:21,980
take that back, make it track 9 out here.

1474
01:51:21,980 --> 01:51:23,980
Oh, god damn you, you can't change on me.

1475
01:51:23,980 --> 01:51:24,980
Yes I can.

1476
01:51:24,980 --> 01:51:26,980
Fine, track 9.

1477
01:51:26,980 --> 01:51:27,980
Alright.

1478
01:51:27,980 --> 01:51:29,980
Can you do this?

1479
01:51:29,980 --> 01:51:33,980
Is this legal in the, in the, um, Cagematch rulebook?

1480
01:51:33,980 --> 01:51:34,980
The bylaws?

1481
01:51:34,980 --> 01:51:36,980
That you can put in a song by the same artist?

1482
01:51:36,980 --> 01:51:38,980
I protest vehemently.

1483
01:51:38,980 --> 01:51:40,980
Just to spite the person who won?

1484
01:51:40,980 --> 01:51:52,940
I hate you alright so it's out here song number two in tonight's cage match pendulum

1485
01:51:52,940 --> 01:51:59,940
without here. Enjoy it.

1486
01:53:22,940 --> 01:53:31,940
Turn down the volume

1487
01:53:31,940 --> 01:53:41,940
Turn down the volume

1488
01:53:41,940 --> 01:53:51,940
Turn down the volume

1489
01:53:51,940 --> 01:53:56,940
And I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't

1490
01:54:21,940 --> 01:54:39,940
Yeah, I'm down to one

1491
01:54:39,940 --> 01:54:49,940
Yeah, I'm down to one

1492
01:56:19,940 --> 01:56:47,940
Tear it down, whoa Tear it down, whoa

1493
01:57:47,940 --> 01:58:11,780
Song number two tonight, Pendulum with Out Here was the name of that song, let's go around

1494
01:58:11,780 --> 01:58:16,060
and see what everybody thought of song number two, which by the way was the same artist

1495
01:58:16,060 --> 01:58:18,460
The song number one, you bastard.

1496
01:58:18,460 --> 01:58:21,160
Star Chakra.

1497
01:58:21,160 --> 01:58:25,880
Um, I really liked it, but it made me think of music from Tekken 5 and Tekken 4.

1498
01:58:25,880 --> 01:58:30,700
Um, I really liked that game, but it's just...

1499
01:58:30,700 --> 01:58:35,080
You know, it was really, it was good, but it seemed very long. I mean, as...

1500
01:58:35,080 --> 01:58:37,200
I really like it a lot.

1501
01:58:37,200 --> 01:58:44,200
But there's something that bugs me about it that I can't really put my finger on. I think it's a 9. It's pretty good.

1502
01:58:44,200 --> 01:58:53,200
It was really cool. I like the album, because I acquired it after listening to the song on last week's episode.

1503
01:58:53,200 --> 01:58:56,200
So yeah, it gives a 9.

1504
01:58:56,200 --> 01:59:01,200
By the way, totally off topic, and I just remembered this when she was talking about puppies.

1505
01:59:01,200 --> 01:59:06,200
I was walking through King's Beach, and they had a store called Dog Baker.

1506
01:59:06,200 --> 01:59:10,200
And I thought, Amal, do they bake dogs there? I'm like, that's pretty wrong.

1507
01:59:10,200 --> 01:59:15,200
No, I know what that place is. They make, um, dog biscuits.

1508
01:59:15,200 --> 01:59:16,200
They cook puppies.

1509
01:59:16,200 --> 01:59:17,200
Extrovert.

1510
01:59:17,200 --> 01:59:25,200
Uh, 10. That song was music to fuck to. I really, really enjoyed that song. It was a good sex song.

1511
01:59:25,200 --> 01:59:29,200
Um, and, uh, you know, Shane has good taste in music.

1512
01:59:29,200 --> 01:59:31,200
Don't, God, don't inflate his ego. God, don't.

1513
01:59:31,200 --> 01:59:38,200
No, no, no, no, no. I'm just going to say, he's serving as an inspiration behind the first song that I'm going to play on my show.

1514
01:59:38,200 --> 01:59:42,680
extra first case of the mondays airing a week from tomorrow

1515
01:59:42,680 --> 01:59:46,160
my thoughts on the song my song was better it really was that was too slow

1516
01:59:46,160 --> 01:59:50,080
and mellow and you should vote for mine instead because that one was too

1517
01:59:50,080 --> 01:59:53,080
i would have thought it was but i want to sleep

1518
01:59:53,080 --> 01:59:54,840
i agree your song was better

1519
01:59:54,840 --> 01:59:57,960
so the the thing is that i had to put a song in now

1520
01:59:57,960 --> 02:00:01,080
so that i can make the final final modifications for the song actually

1521
02:00:01,080 --> 02:00:03,440
i give that song uh... uh...

1522
02:00:03,440 --> 02:00:05,160
too

1523
02:00:05,160 --> 02:00:07,640
for the number of pendulum songs we have in cage match night

1524
02:00:07,640 --> 02:00:09,140
And because mine was better.

1525
02:00:09,140 --> 02:00:13,080
Come on Jimmy, put in your pendulum song. Angel, your thoughts.

1526
02:00:13,080 --> 02:00:14,360
Your, your rating.

1527
02:00:14,360 --> 02:00:16,520
There we go, um...

1528
02:00:16,520 --> 02:00:19,800
I don't know, I'll give it a ten, just cause it's, uh...

1529
02:00:19,800 --> 02:00:23,000
I like it, I like it a lot. Uh...

1530
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:26,680
I was gonna say, good music to, like...

1531
02:00:26,680 --> 02:00:31,640
Have sex too? No, good music to, um...

1532
02:00:31,640 --> 02:00:35,820
Have sex too? No, no, no. Digitally P2? Paint.

1533
02:00:35,820 --> 02:00:38,820
I hate you sick people!

1534
02:00:40,820 --> 02:00:41,820
Oh!

1535
02:00:41,820 --> 02:00:42,820
Alright, let's move on.

1536
02:00:42,820 --> 02:00:44,820
I don't know about your water sports angel, but...

1537
02:00:44,820 --> 02:00:45,820
Dark sacram!

1538
02:00:45,820 --> 02:00:46,820
Jesus.

1539
02:00:46,820 --> 02:00:48,820
What do you have for us tonight?

1540
02:00:48,820 --> 02:00:50,820
Did you make good on your threads?

1541
02:00:50,820 --> 02:00:54,820
I said I was going to put ABBA in, but I forgot that I can't find my copy of ABBA Gold.

1542
02:00:54,820 --> 02:00:57,820
So I put an ABBA cover in.

1543
02:00:57,820 --> 02:00:59,820
So this is a...

1544
02:00:59,820 --> 02:01:03,820
And I don't know if this is the 18th because it said it was the 18th.

1545
02:01:03,820 --> 02:01:04,820
Yes, it's the 18th.

1546
02:01:04,820 --> 02:01:07,820
is the Erotic remix of SOS.

1547
02:01:07,820 --> 02:01:11,820
Which I have a feeling is a false labeling because I do not know of any time Erotic actually

1548
02:01:11,820 --> 02:01:12,820
mixed the songs.

1549
02:01:12,820 --> 02:01:15,220
This could actually just be the Erotic version for all we know.

1550
02:01:15,220 --> 02:01:19,020
It could be, but that's how I've had it for years and I've never knew the difference.

1551
02:01:19,020 --> 02:01:23,220
So some type of remix of SOS by ABBA, one way or another.

1552
02:01:23,220 --> 02:01:26,220
Yeah, I said I would put in ABBA, this is something ABBA.

1553
02:01:26,220 --> 02:01:27,220
Alright.

1554
02:01:27,220 --> 02:01:28,220
Here it is.

1555
02:01:28,220 --> 02:01:28,720
Enjoy!

1556
02:01:58,220 --> 02:02:03,220
To our love, I wish I understood

1557
02:02:04,220 --> 02:02:08,220
It used to be so nice, it used to be so good

1558
02:02:11,220 --> 02:02:16,220
So when you need a new darling, can't you hear me? S.O.S.

1559
02:02:19,220 --> 02:02:24,220
The love you gave me, nothing left to save me, S.O.S.

1560
02:02:24,220 --> 02:02:31,220
When you go, when you go, how can I even try to go?

1561
02:02:31,220 --> 02:02:39,220
When you go, when you go, oh I try, how can I carry on?

1562
02:02:39,220 --> 02:02:47,220
I've been so far away that we were standing here

1563
02:02:47,220 --> 02:02:53,220
You make me feel alive, that's something that I see

1564
02:02:53,220 --> 02:03:01,220
I really tried to make it out, I wish I understood

1565
02:03:01,220 --> 02:03:08,220
What happened to my love, it used to be so good

1566
02:03:08,220 --> 02:03:16,220
But when you're near me darling, can't you hear me? S.O.S.

1567
02:03:16,220 --> 02:03:21,220
The love you gave me, nothing else to save me, ask for it

1568
02:03:23,220 --> 02:03:28,220
When you're gone, when you're gone, how can I even try to know why

1569
02:03:28,220 --> 02:03:37,220
When you go, when you go, go and try How can I carry on, carry on?

1570
02:03:37,220 --> 02:03:56,220
Oh when you near me darling, can't you hear me, S.O.S.

1571
02:03:56,220 --> 02:04:04,220
And love you gave me nothing else to save me, S.O.S.

1572
02:04:04,220 --> 02:04:11,220
when you come, when you come, how can I even try to go on?

1573
02:04:11,220 --> 02:04:19,220
when you come, when you come, go and try, how can I carry on?

1574
02:04:19,220 --> 02:04:26,220
When you come, when you come, how can I even try to go on, go on?

1575
02:04:26,220 --> 02:04:27,220
I'm on my way

1576
02:04:27,220 --> 02:04:28,220
When you done

1577
02:04:28,220 --> 02:04:29,220
When you done

1578
02:04:29,220 --> 02:04:30,220
When you done

1579
02:04:30,220 --> 02:04:31,220
You're a drown

1580
02:04:31,220 --> 02:04:32,220
How can I

1581
02:04:32,220 --> 02:04:33,220
Carry on

1582
02:04:33,220 --> 02:04:34,220
Carry on

1583
02:04:34,220 --> 02:04:35,220
When you done

1584
02:04:35,220 --> 02:04:36,220
When you done

1585
02:04:36,220 --> 02:04:37,220
When you done

1586
02:04:37,220 --> 02:04:38,220
You're a drown

1587
02:04:38,220 --> 02:04:39,220
How can I

1588
02:04:39,220 --> 02:04:40,220
Carry on

1589
02:04:40,220 --> 02:04:41,220
Carry on

1590
02:04:41,220 --> 02:04:52,120
All right that was song number three in tonight's Cage Mash, the 18th...

1591
02:04:52,120 --> 02:04:53,120
Oh crap!

1592
02:04:53,120 --> 02:04:55,840
Damn just like totally crashed on me.

1593
02:04:55,840 --> 02:04:57,760
That was weird.

1594
02:04:57,760 --> 02:04:58,800
Wow.

1595
02:04:58,800 --> 02:05:00,960
Dead air.

1596
02:05:00,960 --> 02:05:01,680
That's not good.

1597
02:05:01,680 --> 02:05:03,760
Shit.

1598
02:05:03,760 --> 02:05:06,320
OK, well let's go around and see what everybody thought of,

1599
02:05:06,320 --> 02:05:08,040
we'll just have to not have background music right now.

1600
02:05:08,040 --> 02:05:10,120
Or maybe you can have explosive diarrhea.

1601
02:05:10,120 --> 02:05:11,320
Yeah, let's do that.

1602
02:05:11,320 --> 02:05:11,880
Let's do that.

1603
02:05:11,880 --> 02:05:12,600
Since you said shit.

1604
02:05:12,600 --> 02:05:13,360
Ass.

1605
02:05:13,360 --> 02:05:14,680
All right, let's go around and see what everybody thought

1606
02:05:14,680 --> 02:05:15,800
of that song.

1607
02:05:15,800 --> 02:05:21,280
Song number three, 18s with SOS starting off with Dark Sakura.

1608
02:05:21,280 --> 02:05:23,040
I need help.

1609
02:05:23,040 --> 02:05:24,800
SOS.

1610
02:05:24,800 --> 02:05:25,480
OK.

1611
02:05:25,480 --> 02:05:30,000
Um, I actually like that song, um, so it gets an 8.

1612
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:30,920
Okay.

1613
02:05:30,920 --> 02:05:32,160
Loki.

1614
02:05:32,160 --> 02:05:34,280
I didn't like it.

1615
02:05:34,280 --> 02:05:37,520
It's just not for me. It's too...

1616
02:05:37,520 --> 02:05:38,880
I don't know.

1617
02:05:38,880 --> 02:05:41,800
Too happy.

1618
02:05:41,800 --> 02:05:43,640
Too gay. Yes, it's too

1619
02:05:43,640 --> 02:05:44,800
gay. It's too

1620
02:05:44,800 --> 02:05:46,520
flaming gay.

1621
02:05:46,520 --> 02:05:49,440
That's why I don't like the song.

1622
02:05:49,440 --> 02:05:52,440
Let's check on and see what DDRUK has to say about

1623
02:05:52,440 --> 02:06:14,440
In today's news, people smoked crack.

1624
02:06:22,440 --> 02:06:29,440
Well, you guys need to go find... I got nothing. I'm tallying Caged Bash votes. You guys need to figure out how to... I got nothing, but no. No, really.

1625
02:06:29,440 --> 02:06:39,440
As far as official Sim files go, still working on the official stuff. Looks like to me, though, that they're probably not done.

1626
02:06:39,440 --> 02:06:52,440
Okay, what Sakurino wanted to share is that the VJ Army forums are starting their own collection of StepMania sim files for Happy Sky. The whole community. That's the big news.

1627
02:06:52,440 --> 02:07:04,440
Wow. Okay. There you have it. Hooray! More StepFiles for BeatMania songs. Just what we needed. We don't have any of those. We've never had those before.

1628
02:07:04,440 --> 02:07:06,440
Let's beat Mania.

1629
02:07:08,440 --> 02:07:10,440
Beat Mania 2DX, whatever you want to call it.

1630
02:07:10,440 --> 02:07:14,440
Is that when you turn into a maniac and beat someone?

1631
02:07:14,440 --> 02:07:15,440
Yes.

1632
02:07:15,440 --> 02:07:18,440
Oh, wait, did you want me to say Hip Hop Mania?

1633
02:07:18,440 --> 02:07:21,440
Everybody loves the Hip Hop Mania.

1634
02:07:21,440 --> 02:07:24,440
I remember that thing.

1635
02:07:24,440 --> 02:07:26,440
Hip Hop Mania rocks.

1636
02:07:26,440 --> 02:07:28,440
Yo.

1637
02:07:28,440 --> 02:07:30,440
We're going to go to a break.

1638
02:07:30,440 --> 02:07:33,440
When we come back for the break, we're going to announce tonight's Cagemash winner.

1639
02:07:33,440 --> 02:07:37,000
and we're gonna get into the FUs of the week because I know you kids are

1640
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:40,560
angsty and extra for once to give a movie review although I didn't think he

1641
02:07:40,560 --> 02:07:42,160
saw anything this week so I'm

1642
02:07:42,160 --> 02:07:46,480
I'm going to be a little bit surprised surely

1643
02:07:46,480 --> 02:07:49,440
alright so we'll be back after this we're gonna start off with a little bit

1644
02:07:49,440 --> 02:07:50,760
of a

1645
02:07:50,760 --> 02:07:54,240
I think we'll start off with some Daikonkai how's that sound

1646
02:07:54,240 --> 02:08:01,240
We'll be back after this.

1647
02:08:24,240 --> 02:08:25,240
4

1648
02:08:25,240 --> 02:08:26,240
2

1649
02:08:26,240 --> 02:08:27,240
3

1650
02:08:27,240 --> 02:08:28,240
4

1651
02:08:28,240 --> 02:08:29,240
5

1652
02:08:29,240 --> 02:08:30,240
6

1653
02:08:30,240 --> 02:08:31,240
7

1654
02:08:31,240 --> 02:08:32,240
8

1655
02:08:32,240 --> 02:08:33,240
9

1656
02:08:33,240 --> 02:08:34,240
10

1657
02:08:34,240 --> 02:08:35,240
11

1658
02:08:35,240 --> 02:08:36,240
12

1659
02:08:36,240 --> 02:08:37,240
13

1660
02:08:37,240 --> 02:08:38,240
14

1661
02:08:38,240 --> 02:08:39,240
15

1662
02:08:39,240 --> 02:08:40,240
16

1663
02:08:40,240 --> 02:08:41,240
17

1664
02:08:41,240 --> 02:08:42,240
18

1665
02:08:42,240 --> 02:08:43,240
19

1666
02:08:43,240 --> 02:08:44,240
20

1667
02:08:44,240 --> 02:08:45,240
21

1668
02:08:45,240 --> 02:08:46,240
22

1669
02:08:46,240 --> 02:08:47,240
23

1670
02:08:47,240 --> 02:08:48,240
24

1671
02:08:48,240 --> 02:08:49,240
25

1672
02:08:49,240 --> 02:08:50,240
26

1673
02:08:50,240 --> 02:08:51,240
27

1674
02:08:51,240 --> 02:08:52,240
28

1675
02:08:52,240 --> 02:08:53,240
29

1676
02:08:53,240 --> 02:08:55,240
Yeah

1677
02:10:23,240 --> 02:10:27,240
And I can't go back

1678
02:10:27,240 --> 02:10:30,240
I never remember

1679
02:10:30,240 --> 02:10:33,240
You showed me like that

1680
02:10:33,240 --> 02:10:37,240
And I'll play me by your brain

1681
02:10:37,240 --> 02:10:39,240
And I

1682
02:10:39,240 --> 02:10:44,240
Shine tonight

1683
02:11:14,240 --> 02:11:16,240
You're not the same girl you got me on

1684
02:11:16,240 --> 02:11:19,240
You're the same girl

1685
02:11:19,240 --> 02:11:22,240
I'm never like the one I want

1686
02:11:23,240 --> 02:11:25,240
You will show me what you're worth

1687
02:11:25,240 --> 02:11:27,240
I ain't the one

1688
02:11:27,240 --> 02:11:29,240
Lend me my own way

1689
02:14:59,240 --> 02:15:23,560
Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.

1690
02:15:23,560 --> 02:15:26,560
Do you want to be accepted by Hollywood?

1691
02:15:26,560 --> 02:15:27,560
No!

1692
02:15:27,560 --> 02:15:29,560
Do we care what people think of us?

1693
02:15:29,560 --> 02:15:31,560
No!

1694
02:15:31,560 --> 02:15:33,560
Do we want people to kiss our ass?

1695
02:15:33,560 --> 02:15:35,560
Yeah!

1696
02:15:37,560 --> 02:15:42,560
Extreme Bobbani Radio. That's us. Orange Lounge Radio.

1697
02:15:42,560 --> 02:15:44,560
You know, that movie was on TV today.

1698
02:15:44,560 --> 02:15:48,560
Well, it sounds awfully a lot like Jamie there in the promo.

1699
02:15:48,560 --> 02:15:50,560
Do we want people to kiss our ass?

1700
02:15:51,560 --> 02:15:53,560
Yes!

1701
02:15:53,560 --> 02:15:56,560
Absolutely. We love it when people kiss our ass.

1702
02:15:56,560 --> 02:16:13,560
You can kiss our ass by voting us A5 on your player window or voting us on Podcast Alley because no one else did this month. That makes me sad, people.

1703
02:16:13,560 --> 02:16:14,560
Kiss our ass.

1704
02:16:14,560 --> 02:16:16,560
Shut the fuck up.

1705
02:16:16,560 --> 02:16:18,560
That is the gayest I've ever heard you say.

1706
02:16:18,560 --> 02:16:21,560
I can really do gay really well.

1707
02:16:21,560 --> 02:16:25,560
Rob Roberts, tell us what's next.

1708
02:16:25,560 --> 02:16:27,560
You should talk like that always.

1709
02:16:27,560 --> 02:16:30,560
No, I'd kill you. I really would. I would just take you out back and shoot you.

1710
02:16:30,560 --> 02:16:33,560
If you start going super, then I'm going to cry.

1711
02:16:33,560 --> 02:16:35,560
Can you imagine every morning?

1712
02:16:35,560 --> 02:16:38,560
Good morning!

1713
02:16:38,560 --> 02:16:40,560
There's too many gay jokes on tonight's show.

1714
02:16:40,560 --> 02:16:42,560
Hello, Rob!

1715
02:16:42,560 --> 02:16:44,560
We need to tone it down.

1716
02:16:44,560 --> 02:16:46,560
Oh, okay, dude.

1717
02:16:46,560 --> 02:16:48,560
There you go. That's better.

1718
02:16:48,560 --> 02:16:50,560
Do we need a gay promo?

1719
02:16:50,560 --> 02:16:52,560
No we don't. Yes we do.

1720
02:16:52,560 --> 02:16:54,560
Listen to Orange Lounge.

1721
02:16:54,560 --> 02:16:56,560
I guess this show is only going to get gayer

1722
02:16:56,560 --> 02:16:58,560
because we are going to allow Ex-Defer

1723
02:16:58,560 --> 02:17:00,560
to do his movie review!

1724
02:17:00,560 --> 02:17:02,560
Don't play the music.

1725
02:17:06,560 --> 02:17:08,560
I just, I don't know.

1726
02:17:08,560 --> 02:17:10,560
I don't know about that.

1727
02:17:10,560 --> 02:17:12,560
Alright, what did you see this week?

1728
02:17:12,560 --> 02:17:14,560
Well, I didn't see it this week, but I just thought

1729
02:17:14,560 --> 02:17:22,480
I mean, it was kind of like a spur-of-the-moment idea that I would review Deep Impact, because

1730
02:17:22,480 --> 02:17:31,300
Gene Shalit of Today called it a thriller with brains, and Jeffrey Lyons of NBC TV said

1731
02:17:31,300 --> 02:17:36,680
it was exhilarating the special effects highlight of the year, which really nobody saw Deep

1732
02:17:36,680 --> 02:17:39,480
Impact because they all saw that other one.

1733
02:17:39,480 --> 02:17:41,160
I saw Deep Impact in the theater.

1734
02:17:41,160 --> 02:17:42,160
I did too.

1735
02:17:42,160 --> 02:17:49,160
Actually I liked it better than the other one, I was going to say Asteroid, but that was the one on TV.

1736
02:17:49,160 --> 02:17:55,160
I liked Deep Impact because Téa Leoni died in it, and sorry to ruin it for you, but she died in it and I hate her.

1737
02:17:55,160 --> 02:18:04,160
Dances are doing one about hurricanes called category 7. I'm like, that's insulting.

1738
02:18:04,160 --> 02:18:07,160
So what do you think of it?

1739
02:18:07,160 --> 02:18:17,160
I think it was a good movie. I think it was kind of, you know, cheesy or whatever, but I thought it had a little bit more drama in it than the other movie, Armageddon.

1740
02:18:17,160 --> 02:18:18,160
Drama?

1741
02:18:18,160 --> 02:18:22,160
Yeah, drama. It had some drama in it and we all loved it.

1742
02:18:22,160 --> 02:18:24,160
We all ate it up.

1743
02:18:24,160 --> 02:18:32,160
No, but it was really good. I think there should be a porn called Deep Impact and if there hasn't been yet, I think they should make one.

1744
02:18:32,160 --> 02:18:37,980
because then it would be like about a giant cock headed towards some

1745
02:18:37,980 --> 02:18:42,120
unsuspecting guy's anus and then you know he can't escape it and there's

1746
02:18:42,120 --> 02:18:49,920
going to be a white wave at the end of the movie what do you think Rob I think

1747
02:18:49,920 --> 02:18:53,820
it's a I think it's a seller you're an asshole you know people make it's a

1748
02:18:53,820 --> 02:18:58,840
billion-dollar industry the porn business and I mean a lot of people buy

1749
02:18:58,840 --> 02:19:05,760
that gay porn even straight guys I think that gay porn is funny I think that all

1750
02:19:05,760 --> 02:19:12,600
porn is great hello this is all about Jeff striker he's he's kind of gay for

1751
02:19:12,600 --> 02:19:18,840
pay but he's funny he is funny because he's like oh I want to do you he's

1752
02:19:18,840 --> 02:19:23,960
hilarious and then he's and then you hear a horse go in the background I

1753
02:19:23,960 --> 02:19:28,500
think that he's hilarious have you seen that scene yet no I have I should show

1754
02:19:28,500 --> 02:19:34,120
it to you. It's great. Are you done with a movie review? Um, oh, Deep Impact. Um, rent

1755
02:19:34,120 --> 02:19:39,480
it, buy it, I don't know. Like, it's probably on eBay for like two bucks. I mean, you may

1756
02:19:39,480 --> 02:19:44,440
be able to get it, pick it up at Walmart in their bargain bin. Is it called a bargain

1757
02:19:44,440 --> 02:19:53,440
bin? The, the five dollar bin, maybe. Um, watch it with your kids. I don't, I, I have

1758
02:19:53,440 --> 02:19:56,440
Um, vote for song number two.

1759
02:19:56,440 --> 02:19:59,440
And fuck to it.

1760
02:19:59,440 --> 02:20:02,440
Alright, let's see tonight's winner of the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match.

1761
02:20:02,440 --> 02:20:04,440
Speaking of which, it's a little late to have your plug in there,

1762
02:20:04,440 --> 02:20:06,440
because we already have a winner for tonight's cage match.

1763
02:20:06,440 --> 02:20:08,440
Are you ready to find out who it is?

1764
02:20:08,440 --> 02:20:13,440
The winner of tonight's Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match is...

1765
02:20:16,440 --> 02:20:18,440
Where's the song? Oh, here it is.

1766
02:20:18,440 --> 02:20:25,440
Song number one!

1767
02:20:25,440 --> 02:20:28,440
Pendulum Hold Your Color wins song number one.

1768
02:20:28,440 --> 02:20:29,440
Loki?

1769
02:20:29,440 --> 02:20:30,440
Suck it, Loki.

1770
02:20:30,440 --> 02:20:31,440
I mean, I could take him.

1771
02:20:31,440 --> 02:20:32,440
I could take Rob.

1772
02:20:32,440 --> 02:20:33,440
Suck it!

1773
02:20:33,440 --> 02:20:35,440
More ABBA next week!

1774
02:20:35,440 --> 02:20:37,440
More Pendulum next week.

1775
02:20:37,440 --> 02:20:38,440
Great.

1776
02:20:38,440 --> 02:20:41,440
Yeah, I'll have to counteract that with Echo Image.

1777
02:20:41,440 --> 02:20:44,440
We've already put in all the Echo Image songs.

1778
02:20:44,440 --> 02:20:47,440
Have we put in the entire Echo Image CD at some point here?

1779
02:20:47,440 --> 02:20:51,940
And then, what's the other one that I could bring up? I'll bring Vincent to more.

1780
02:20:51,940 --> 02:20:55,440
I'll combat you with info.

1781
02:20:55,440 --> 02:20:59,940
Or like, Cybertrans or something, CyberX.

1782
02:20:59,940 --> 02:21:02,940
On that note, let's get into tonight's FUs of the Week, shall we?

1783
02:21:02,940 --> 02:21:05,940
DarkSakura, why is it that we do the FUs of the Week every single week?

1784
02:21:05,940 --> 02:21:09,440
Oh, by the way, kids, you can send in your FUs to me right now, but keep them short!

1785
02:21:09,440 --> 02:21:11,440
Why is it we do the F.U.'s of the Week every single week?

1786
02:21:21,440 --> 02:21:27,440
F.U. to old people who think that they have perfect night vision and can drive.

1787
02:21:28,440 --> 02:21:31,440
No, you really can't, you suck.

1788
02:21:31,440 --> 02:21:43,440
Um, ugh. I just, I'm good at being busy and F you to my medication that I can't really go into too much detail about on the air.

1789
02:21:43,440 --> 02:21:48,440
Um, F you to hormones. I'm done.

1790
02:21:48,440 --> 02:21:51,440
Let's get to Loki's F yous.

1791
02:21:51,440 --> 02:22:15,440
My FUs first begins with the Hyatt at Lake Tahoe. Fuck you to their service because it sucks. First they gave me the wrong room with the wrong bed in it. Then they tried to charge me $3 for something that was supposedly taken out of the mini bar, despite the fact that they never gave me the key for the mini bar and it was zip tied shut. So that would have been some magic.

1792
02:22:15,440 --> 02:22:37,440
Um, anyways, um, also fuck you to having to, you know, make the two hour drive to Lake Tahoe, I was actually driving around on the weekend and there's these stupid people in SUVs trying to tailgate me, um, along these roads that are really windy and stuff, and the speed limit's only 45 anyways, and the guy is driving down the center line, cause he's trying to pass me on double yellow.

1793
02:22:37,440 --> 02:22:47,440
So fuck you to the... fucking SUV drivers. At least though, they're in Tahoe where there are actual hills and snow, so SUVs are allowed there, but... yeah, they still suck.

1794
02:22:48,440 --> 02:22:57,440
And finally, um, just fuck you to the fact that I was actually bored enough to bid on some item on eBay for god knows how much money,

1795
02:22:57,440 --> 02:23:10,440
And now I have this stupid poster that may be autographed by the entire cast of True Crime's New York, but now I have this thing that I had paid way too much money for, and it sucks.

1796
02:23:10,440 --> 02:23:20,440
But at least it went to charity, so I guess that's okay, but still too much money spent this weekend, and fuck you, they'll hide it again for having their slots being way too damn tight.

1797
02:23:20,440 --> 02:23:23,440
It's just like playing in any casino, so fuck them.

1798
02:23:23,440 --> 02:23:52,440
I'm actually really not that angsty, all things considered. I am really angsty at one situation right now, but I can't talk about it on air, but it's something related to something I can't go to, that I wanted to go to, and now I can't go to it, and that makes me upset, because I don't like it when I don't get my way. So, F you to me not getting my way.

1799
02:23:52,440 --> 02:23:58,440
And an F.U. to traffic on Watt Avenue the other day because it was stupid.

1800
02:23:58,440 --> 02:24:04,440
And an F.U. to candy corn because it's really addicting, but you know what's even more addicting than candy corn?

1801
02:24:04,440 --> 02:24:07,440
Is that Indian corn, the one that tastes like chocolate.

1802
02:24:07,440 --> 02:24:11,440
Shit is so good. I'm telling you, that shit is so good.

1803
02:24:11,440 --> 02:24:14,440
Just don't eat candy.

1804
02:24:14,440 --> 02:24:16,440
I can't do that.

1805
02:24:16,440 --> 02:24:18,440
They make sugar-free candy corn, by the way.

1806
02:24:18,440 --> 02:24:20,440
Ooh, maybe now that, maybe I could do it.

1807
02:24:20,440 --> 02:24:22,440
But it makes you take a shit really bad if you eat too much of it.

1808
02:24:22,440 --> 02:24:23,440
At least I'd lose weight.

1809
02:24:26,440 --> 02:24:27,440
That's it.

1810
02:24:27,440 --> 02:24:30,440
Uh, Xtapher, let's get to your FUs tonight.

1811
02:24:31,440 --> 02:24:37,440
Uh, FU, fuck you to me, because I keep talking about sex, I need to get laid.

1812
02:24:38,440 --> 02:24:41,440
And I, I, I'm just talking about it way too much.

1813
02:24:41,440 --> 02:24:45,440
Um, so, yeah, fuck, fuck you to me, hopefully soon.

1814
02:24:45,440 --> 02:24:51,200
Um, and, yeah, I think that's pretty much it.

1815
02:24:51,200 --> 02:24:59,040
And I know there was something I was thinking about, and I can't remember it, so on to Angel.

1816
02:24:59,040 --> 02:25:00,720
Angel.

1817
02:25:00,720 --> 02:25:12,200
I've been to my computer, um, deciding to kill itself during a Scarlet Monastery run, which, uh, I don't know if you guys have all gotten that high or not, but, um,

1818
02:25:12,200 --> 02:25:20,940
Yet that wasn't cool when it did that because I had other stuff to do this weekend after

1819
02:25:20,940 --> 02:25:27,180
I was playing World of Warcraft so luckily it died after my portfolio was due for school

1820
02:25:27,180 --> 02:25:33,420
so that's a good thing but it still sucks I don't have a PC right now.

1821
02:25:33,420 --> 02:25:40,420
Other than that, all is well, I believe, so that's it for me.

1822
02:26:03,420 --> 02:26:10,460
Ron Chan would like to say an FU to Cablevision for coming to an install to replace a cable

1823
02:26:10,460 --> 02:26:11,460
modem.

1824
02:26:11,460 --> 02:26:12,540
Something that I could have done myself.

1825
02:26:12,540 --> 02:26:15,380
I didn't need to be up at 8am for this.

1826
02:26:15,380 --> 02:26:19,800
Nintendo Maniac 64 says FU to myself for not even touching my homework yet and it's like

1827
02:26:19,800 --> 02:26:21,460
midnight here on the east coast.

1828
02:26:21,460 --> 02:26:25,860
FU to our new Netgear wireless router that killed the internet on one of our computers

1829
02:26:25,860 --> 02:26:28,580
and required a reformat to get the router to work.

1830
02:26:28,580 --> 02:26:34,100
F you to my laptop for not being able to run Quake 2 using OpenGL at a smooth speed.

1831
02:26:34,100 --> 02:26:38,540
Tomokun says fuck my friend for overdosing on a ton of nutmeg last night at the homecoming

1832
02:26:38,540 --> 02:26:39,540
dance.

1833
02:26:39,540 --> 02:26:42,980
She knew she was allergic to it and that it makes you more sick than high.

1834
02:26:42,980 --> 02:26:44,780
It was attempted suicide.

1835
02:26:44,780 --> 02:26:51,120
Fuck you for attempting suicide by overdoing something you're allergic to.

1836
02:26:51,120 --> 02:26:54,620
And then he said don't read something but I did, I'm sorry.

1837
02:26:54,620 --> 02:26:58,820
The Dark Knight says F you to returning to work today and almost died of heat exhaustion

1838
02:26:58,820 --> 02:27:02,260
and an F you for my vacation coming to an end.

1839
02:27:02,260 --> 02:27:06,900
Jaded 2005 says F you to my internet for dying during the cage match.

1840
02:27:06,900 --> 02:27:11,180
Sakarina says F you to my teachers for only putting 10% of the marks that should be on

1841
02:27:11,180 --> 02:27:12,620
my midterm report card.

1842
02:27:12,620 --> 02:27:17,940
I'm not complaining about the actual marks that are there, but the ones that aren't there.

1843
02:27:17,940 --> 02:27:21,140
Mikolatov says F you to me for giving up Taco Bell.

1844
02:27:21,140 --> 02:27:24,140
If you know me in person, you know how big of a deal this is.

1845
02:27:24,140 --> 02:27:29,420
just gasps. F you also to Milpitas Golf Land because that place is too ghetto to

1846
02:27:29,420 --> 02:27:33,000
house a perfectly lovely pump exceed machine. But there was a guy that liked

1847
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:37,360
you at the one that we have over here. DarklionXVI says one F you for tonight. F

1848
02:27:37,360 --> 02:27:44,080
you to Cox Communications for charging 75 bucks just to change the splitter that

1849
02:27:44,080 --> 02:27:47,960
connects both my TV and cable modem. Few days later I'm still getting disconnects

1850
02:27:47,960 --> 02:27:54,960
do to line and signal issues. Dark Tetsuya says F you to my crappy connection as always,

1851
02:27:56,400 --> 02:28:03,400
and F you to Squeenix for not giving me my slime keychain with my DQ8 demo. Goggle says,

1852
02:28:03,880 --> 02:28:07,840
and I almost said Google but I stopped myself, Goggle says, Froke everyone at the homecoming

1853
02:28:07,840 --> 02:28:12,240
dance for stopping when Dancing Queen came on. Just because it's not rap doesn't mean

1854
02:28:12,240 --> 02:28:16,720
you can't dance. Hey, I would have danced to Dancing Queen. It says dancing in its name.

1855
02:28:16,720 --> 02:28:27,720
I would have danced to that. I would have danced to it and I don't really like it. You know what they played at my first homecoming dance? It just dates me? The Humpty dance.

1856
02:28:27,720 --> 02:28:34,720
It's your chance. I don't remember what they played at our, a lot of Nirvana. Because my first homecoming was in 1990.

1857
02:28:34,720 --> 02:28:39,720
Oh, I didn't go to my homecoming dance. No, I didn't go to the prom.

1858
02:28:39,720 --> 02:28:46,720
I was at Red Robin last night watching all the people in their dresses and it was like a fashion show.

1859
02:28:46,720 --> 02:28:52,720
Goggle, invite us to the prom next time and we'll dance to Dancing Queen with you.

1860
02:28:52,720 --> 02:28:56,720
Oh my god, I would so go to the prom.

1861
02:28:56,720 --> 02:29:00,720
Hey, I still get carded, okay?

1862
02:29:00,720 --> 02:29:05,720
FU to the Digital Life Expo for not having that much free shit to go around this year.

1863
02:29:05,720 --> 02:29:08,720
FU to the 8 Days of Rain we had these past few days.

1864
02:29:08,720 --> 02:29:11,720
FU to the two asshats who host G4's X-Play.

1865
02:29:11,720 --> 02:29:16,720
You probably know who they are for bashing the shit out of DDRXtreme 2's songs and for mocking the fuck out of it.

1866
02:29:16,720 --> 02:29:19,720
Oh, I didn't see this. I should.

1867
02:29:19,720 --> 02:29:24,720
SSJ100Matt says FU to the Yankees for being knocked out of the playoffs. Go White Sox.

1868
02:29:24,720 --> 02:29:28,720
FU to this show turning into Prawn Lounge Radio.

1869
02:29:28,720 --> 02:29:31,220
Hee hee! We're horny. No apologies.

1870
02:29:52,720 --> 02:29:54,220
Well, it's not healthy.

1871
02:29:54,220 --> 02:29:56,720
I double-F you that. That's crappy.

1872
02:29:56,720 --> 02:30:00,440
You know what else? You know what? It's something about science teachers, our total cunts. I'll

1873
02:30:00,440 --> 02:30:05,280
tell you why. Because I had a ballad. I don't care if I drop the C-bomb. This guy deserves

1874
02:30:05,280 --> 02:30:10,280
it. My least favorite teacher of all time. Biology teacher I had in high school, right?

1875
02:30:10,280 --> 02:30:14,040
We were supposed to do a report. We had to do a report and it was like a final. It was

1876
02:30:14,040 --> 02:30:20,080
a final paper. And the final was on any North American animal was what the report had to

1877
02:30:20,080 --> 02:30:25,840
be on. I chose the vampire bat. Because it had the word vampire in it and I thought it

1878
02:30:25,840 --> 02:30:30,840
it was cool, the vampire bat is a bat from Mexico. We were all going around and

1879
02:30:30,840 --> 02:30:34,100
what he did is he said, I'm going to give you 3 extra credit points after we handed

1880
02:30:34,100 --> 02:30:36,720
in all our papers. He says, I want to know what you really learned and I'm going to give

1881
02:30:36,720 --> 02:30:41,400
you three extra credit points if you memorize the scientific name of your animal. Well I

1882
02:30:41,400 --> 02:30:45,080
knew mine and I said it out loud, and he said, great, you get the 3 extra credit points!

1883
02:30:45,080 --> 02:30:48,360
Unfortunately, I'm going to flunk you on the paper. In fact the whole class, he said this,

1884
02:30:48,360 --> 02:30:51,880
I'm going to flunk you on the paper because your animal is not from North America. That's

1885
02:30:51,880 --> 02:30:55,240
bullshit! I said, that's bullshit, Mexico IS in North America! And he said, no, that's

1886
02:30:55,240 --> 02:30:59,520
Central America. I said, I took him to task on this. I said, what do you call the North

1887
02:30:59,520 --> 02:31:05,640
American Free Trade Agreement, which involves Canada, U.S., and Mexico? And I still, I didn't

1888
02:31:05,640 --> 02:31:12,320
get it. I just finally, I got a D. I got a D. I got a D on the report. I would have taken

1889
02:31:12,320 --> 02:31:15,840
it to the principal. I would have done it too. I should have, but I... I have done that

1890
02:31:15,840 --> 02:31:20,440
to teachers when I was a child. I was too passive. I'm sorry if your teaching staff

1891
02:31:20,440 --> 02:31:24,360
here is fucking incompetent, but... I will never forget that to this day, and this is

1892
02:31:24,360 --> 02:31:27,360
is why I hate biology. That one incident is why I hate biology.

1893
02:31:27,360 --> 02:31:31,360
Your science teacher was a moron because even named by the continents.

1894
02:31:31,360 --> 02:31:36,360
Central America is just more of a categorization than it is continent.

1895
02:31:36,360 --> 02:31:38,360
The continent is the North American continent.

1896
02:31:38,360 --> 02:31:41,360
He backed up and said he said something from the United States.

1897
02:31:41,360 --> 02:31:43,360
I said, no, you said North American.

1898
02:31:43,360 --> 02:31:44,360
Exactly.

1899
02:31:44,360 --> 02:31:46,360
Bullshit. But that guy has been teaching at the school.

1900
02:31:46,360 --> 02:31:48,360
You should have said, excuse me.

1901
02:31:48,360 --> 02:31:50,360
That guy had been teaching at the school for three years.

1902
02:31:50,360 --> 02:31:51,360
What was I going to do?

1903
02:31:51,360 --> 02:31:52,360
I could see you saying that.

1904
02:31:52,360 --> 02:31:53,360
Go out to the baseball.

1905
02:31:53,360 --> 02:31:57,280
write him a letter here ten years later, why I hate biology, it's because of you. Do it!

1906
02:31:57,280 --> 02:32:03,000
Here I am on the internet bashing him. He probably has prostate cancer. He's probably

1907
02:32:03,000 --> 02:32:09,080
dying. I hate to put it, okay, the next semester, okay, this is really bad, I don't care. You're

1908
02:32:09,080 --> 02:32:13,080
going to kill him. No, I'm not going to, don't say that, because they'll come after me, the

1909
02:32:13,080 --> 02:32:16,980
FBI will come after him, I'm not going to kill him. He's just a sad, sad old man with

1910
02:32:16,980 --> 02:32:19,960
nothing better to do but fail kids on their reports because he doesn't know what he's

1911
02:32:19,960 --> 02:32:24,800
No, but here's the thing, like the next quarter, whatever, this was like the first quarter,

1912
02:32:24,800 --> 02:32:29,000
the next quarter, he like broke his neck, like literally, and some, we had a female

1913
02:32:29,000 --> 02:32:33,600
teacher come in for like three months, and then he came back and he had a humongous neck

1914
02:32:33,600 --> 02:32:36,760
brace, and my thought was, karma, motherfucker.

1915
02:32:36,760 --> 02:32:37,760
You know what?

1916
02:32:37,760 --> 02:32:42,000
So, you know what I feel so bad about during my high school years is because there was

1917
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:46,720
a teacher, my data processing teacher, who was going to flunk me on something, some random

1918
02:32:46,720 --> 02:32:50,720
thing that I kind of stood up for myself for, and I like yelled at the guy.

1919
02:32:50,720 --> 02:32:54,960
It was the only teacher that in, well, one of the two teachers I yelled at my whole time

1920
02:32:54,960 --> 02:32:56,680
going to school.

1921
02:32:56,680 --> 02:33:04,240
And a couple of years later, he died in like a kind of a freak accident involving stones

1922
02:33:04,240 --> 02:33:05,800
and nature or something.

1923
02:33:05,800 --> 02:33:11,480
And like he, like I never ever like got a chance to like apologize for that, you know,

1924
02:33:11,480 --> 02:33:13,720
or whatever, because I was really kind of like...

1925
02:33:13,720 --> 02:33:15,840
Would you like to apologize now?

1926
02:33:15,840 --> 02:33:24,760
Well, I don't know if he's, he was a bastard, so he's probably in hell, so I guess I should

1927
02:33:24,760 --> 02:33:28,200
look down and say, hey, how's it going?

1928
02:33:28,200 --> 02:33:35,040
I'll see you in a couple years, in a few years, there's a few years on me.

1929
02:33:35,040 --> 02:33:38,720
The sad thing is my biology teacher was really old, he is probably dead, he's been like ten

1930
02:33:38,720 --> 02:33:39,720
years since high school.

1931
02:33:39,720 --> 02:33:40,720
You know what I'm sad about?

1932
02:33:40,720 --> 02:33:41,720
What?

1933
02:33:41,720 --> 02:33:42,720
That we haven't done a match game.

1934
02:33:42,720 --> 02:33:45,240
I know, we're not going to get to it either, probably.

1935
02:33:45,240 --> 02:33:46,240
Oh darn!

1936
02:33:46,240 --> 02:33:49,760
I haven't written questions, so I'll write questions for next week and we'll get to it

1937
02:33:49,760 --> 02:33:50,760
for sure.

1938
02:33:50,760 --> 02:33:55,280
Anyway, so what, now, I am, the ironic thing is, I'm a teacher now.

1939
02:33:55,280 --> 02:33:57,120
I just don't teach high school kids, but I teach-

1940
02:33:57,120 --> 02:33:58,120
You teach something worse.

1941
02:33:58,120 --> 02:34:01,680
I teach adults, which is much worse in some scenarios, but you know, for the most part

1942
02:34:01,680 --> 02:34:04,760
it's okay.

1943
02:34:04,760 --> 02:34:06,480
Actually when I'm in class, everything is great.

1944
02:34:06,480 --> 02:34:09,760
It's everything I have to deal with outside of class that irks me, usually.

1945
02:34:09,760 --> 02:34:11,480
When I'm in class, everything's fine.

1946
02:34:11,480 --> 02:34:13,400
And I actually taught X to per.

1947
02:34:13,400 --> 02:34:14,400
You did.

1948
02:34:14,400 --> 02:34:16,440
You're my daddy.

1949
02:34:16,440 --> 02:34:17,280
No, you aren't.

1950
02:34:17,280 --> 02:34:19,440
And extrovert got 100% on most of his exams.

1951
02:34:19,440 --> 02:34:21,080
I got 100%.

1952
02:34:21,080 --> 02:34:22,120
Yes, he did.

1953
02:34:22,120 --> 02:34:24,200
OK, but teachers, for the most part,

1954
02:34:24,200 --> 02:34:25,320
are usually really awesome.

1955
02:34:25,320 --> 02:34:26,120
They really are.

1956
02:34:26,120 --> 02:34:26,840
You want to know why?

1957
02:34:26,840 --> 02:34:28,280
I've had a lot of awesome teachers.

1958
02:34:28,280 --> 02:34:29,800
You know what's very sad, though,

1959
02:34:29,800 --> 02:34:31,360
is that for all the training classes

1960
02:34:31,360 --> 02:34:33,760
that they've been making us do, or they've

1961
02:34:33,760 --> 02:34:36,240
been making us learn all the customer service crap.

1962
02:34:36,240 --> 02:34:38,840
And I did customer service, so I knew all of the shit,

1963
02:34:38,840 --> 02:34:41,000
and I helped teach the class, basically.

1964
02:34:41,000 --> 02:34:47,240
I would suggest things that might not have been in the material that they would need

1965
02:34:47,240 --> 02:34:48,240
to know.

1966
02:34:48,240 --> 02:34:50,760
You know, that's how I got into training, though, where I work, is that I was sitting

1967
02:34:50,760 --> 02:34:51,920
in the class as a student.

1968
02:34:51,920 --> 02:34:55,480
I was suggesting how to make it better, and that impressed the trainer, and she suggested

1969
02:34:55,480 --> 02:34:56,480
I should be in.

1970
02:34:56,480 --> 02:35:00,800
See, HR positions aren't opening up in my work, so I'm going into compliance if I get

1971
02:35:00,800 --> 02:35:01,940
the job.

1972
02:35:01,940 --> 02:35:03,440
I want to be in HR.

1973
02:35:03,440 --> 02:35:04,440
That's one of my things.

1974
02:35:04,440 --> 02:35:05,440
I really do want to be in HR.

1975
02:35:05,440 --> 02:35:09,240
Well, this is great and all, but let's get into another segment.

1976
02:35:09,240 --> 02:35:10,240
So back to HR.

1977
02:35:10,240 --> 02:35:11,240
in it.

1978
02:35:11,240 --> 02:35:13,400
Yeah, you want to be all up in it, I'm sure.

1979
02:35:13,400 --> 02:35:14,400
Let's get back to Angel's Watersports.

1980
02:35:14,400 --> 02:35:15,400
Humpin' Repulses.

1981
02:35:15,400 --> 02:35:16,400
Huh?

1982
02:35:16,400 --> 02:35:17,800
Humpin' Repulses.

1983
02:35:17,800 --> 02:35:18,800
The Humpty Dance.

1984
02:35:18,800 --> 02:35:19,800
All right.

1985
02:35:19,800 --> 02:35:21,280
I want to get back to Angel's Watersports.

1986
02:35:21,280 --> 02:35:22,720
I don't want to get back to Angel's Watersports.

1987
02:35:22,720 --> 02:35:23,720
Oh, okay.

1988
02:35:23,720 --> 02:35:25,720
Then we don't have to get to your Watersports.

1989
02:35:25,720 --> 02:35:27,720
She's doing the blink thing, where she's like, blink, blink, what?

1990
02:35:27,720 --> 02:35:29,720
I like alcohol.

1991
02:35:29,720 --> 02:35:30,720
You know-

1992
02:35:30,720 --> 02:35:35,320
Alcohol makes you pee, and peeing has to do with Angel's Watersports.

1993
02:35:35,320 --> 02:35:36,960
How about that, Angel?

1994
02:35:36,960 --> 02:35:41,960
Um, no, but Jamie is the only one that successfully got me to drink liquor once.

1995
02:35:41,960 --> 02:35:42,960
Is that good?

1996
02:35:42,960 --> 02:35:43,960
Yeah.

1997
02:35:43,960 --> 02:35:45,960
I'm gonna bring over some sake one day.

1998
02:35:45,960 --> 02:35:46,960
And did you pee?

1999
02:35:46,960 --> 02:35:49,960
Can I bring up an actually relevant Bimani story real quick?

2000
02:35:49,960 --> 02:35:50,960
Sure, Rod!

2001
02:35:50,960 --> 02:35:53,960
Okay, we're gonna go to break and we're gonna come back and do Ask Orange Lounge because

2002
02:35:53,960 --> 02:35:55,960
the chat room is begging for it tonight.

2003
02:35:55,960 --> 02:35:58,960
Somebody gave me a link to this and I don't remember who now.

2004
02:35:58,960 --> 02:35:59,960
Oh, it was Goggle.

2005
02:35:59,960 --> 02:36:00,960
Goggle gave me this.

2006
02:36:00,960 --> 02:36:01,960
Thank you, Goggle.

2007
02:36:01,960 --> 02:36:02,960
Cuntastic.

2008
02:36:02,960 --> 02:36:04,960
No, it's not, it's not Cuntastic.

2009
02:36:04,960 --> 02:36:06,960
Oh, I mean, I kind of said that on a whim.

2010
02:36:06,960 --> 02:36:08,960
Yeah, you did. So shut up.

2011
02:36:08,960 --> 02:36:10,960
Take his mic. Loki, please take his microphone away.

2012
02:36:10,960 --> 02:36:13,960
He's punished. Take it away. Take it away.

2013
02:36:13,960 --> 02:36:14,960
All right.

2014
02:36:14,960 --> 02:36:21,960
Vagle sent us a story, and it has to do with the Serious Games Summit.

2015
02:36:21,960 --> 02:36:22,960
Seriously, you guys, serious.

2016
02:36:22,960 --> 02:36:28,960
No, what it is actually, it's going to be a, I guess, kind of summit thing going on.

2017
02:36:28,960 --> 02:36:31,960
It's actually going to happen in Washington, D.C. at the Serious Games Summit.

2018
02:36:31,960 --> 02:36:33,960
And it's going to be Monday, October 31st.

2019
02:36:33,960 --> 02:36:39,920
October 31st. Hey, that's Halloween. From 4.15 PM to 5.15 PM, it's a, like, session

2020
02:36:39,920 --> 02:36:46,480
on Dance Dance Revolution, the most researched serious game ever. Why and what have we learned?

2021
02:36:46,480 --> 02:36:51,480
And here's what it says on the little website synopsis. DDR is a game, a social activity,

2022
02:36:51,480 --> 02:36:56,520
a dance and performance platform, a community, a form of vigorous exercise, a weight loss

2023
02:36:56,520 --> 02:37:00,720
tool and more. It serves different needs for different people and it has been put to many

2024
02:37:00,720 --> 02:37:06,640
any surprising uses. This talk analyzes, or as I like to say, analizes, the appeal of

2025
02:37:06,640 --> 02:37:11,040
DDR and the many ways it has been implemented and researched as a serious game. It reviews

2026
02:37:11,040 --> 02:37:16,300
current research finding and then examines the exergaming phenomenon in general and where

2027
02:37:16,300 --> 02:37:19,040
it is heading. And I bet you we won't be mentioned at all.

2028
02:37:19,040 --> 02:37:28,040
Dude, that's insulting, because we're fabulous. We are the backbone of the DDR community.

2029
02:37:58,040 --> 02:38:01,040
We are the backbone of the DDR community.

2030
02:38:01,040 --> 02:38:05,040
Actually, we are the backbone of the entire video gaming community, really.

2031
02:38:05,040 --> 02:38:08,040
Because we are the number one rated podcast.

2032
02:38:08,040 --> 02:38:14,040
I don't know about that, but we managed to win an award, and we're cool.

2033
02:38:14,040 --> 02:38:16,040
Adam Curry digs us.

2034
02:38:16,040 --> 02:38:18,040
That's right, Adam Curry likes us.

2035
02:38:18,040 --> 02:38:20,040
I like his hair.

2036
02:38:20,040 --> 02:38:25,040
Adam Curry, if you're listening, I want to know what hairstyle you're talking about.

2037
02:38:25,040 --> 02:38:27,040
He's listening. He's got nothing better to do than say,

2038
02:38:27,040 --> 02:38:29,040
Oh, I'm going to listen to Orange Lawn's radio tonight because I want to hear it.

2039
02:38:29,040 --> 02:38:32,040
He's probably listening to his old tapes that he did.

2040
02:38:32,040 --> 02:38:36,040
You know, DJing on MTV or whatever.

2041
02:38:36,040 --> 02:38:38,040
I like Adam Curry, and he was...

2042
02:38:38,040 --> 02:38:40,040
I had such a thing for Adam Curry when I was younger.

2043
02:38:40,040 --> 02:38:42,040
Really? I kind of liked him too when I was younger.

2044
02:38:42,040 --> 02:38:45,040
And Colin Quinn, actually, because I liked his jaw.

2045
02:38:45,040 --> 02:38:47,040
I didn't like that.

2046
02:38:47,040 --> 02:38:50,040
If somebody would go to this lecture and tape it for us and get us a CD

2047
02:38:50,040 --> 02:38:53,040
so we can mock it on air, that would be great.

2048
02:38:53,040 --> 02:38:57,040
No, I'm sure it'll be interesting. I'm curious to see what they have to say. We'll see.

2049
02:38:57,040 --> 02:39:03,040
Alright, we'll be back after this. We're going to take a quick Tucson break and we're going to do some Ask Orange Lounge.

2050
02:39:03,040 --> 02:39:05,040
Sending your questions right now kids

2051
02:39:33,040 --> 02:39:57,040
I'm a thief, I'm a thief I'm a thief, I'm a thief

2052
02:39:57,040 --> 02:40:15,040
I believe, I believe, I believe

2053
02:41:27,040 --> 02:41:48,200
Music

2054
02:41:48,200 --> 02:42:04,200
Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

2055
02:42:04,200 --> 02:42:17,200
We're back on Orange Lounge Radio, and we're going to get into a little segment here you guys know and love.

2056
02:42:17,200 --> 02:42:20,200
We're getting a lot of questions tonight, too, so we've got to get right into it.

2057
02:42:20,200 --> 02:42:22,200
It's Ask Orange Lounge.

2058
02:42:22,200 --> 02:42:26,200
Don't forget our podcast, boys and girls, which we do every week.

2059
02:42:26,200 --> 02:42:29,200
www.orangeloungelounge.com. Click on the to-go edition.

2060
02:42:29,200 --> 02:42:32,200
Are you okay? What the hell?

2061
02:42:32,200 --> 02:42:34,200
I'm making funny faces.

2062
02:42:34,200 --> 02:42:35,200
Why are you making faces?

2063
02:42:35,200 --> 02:42:36,200
Because I can.

2064
02:42:36,200 --> 02:42:40,200
We're going to do some Ask Orange Lounge.

2065
02:42:40,200 --> 02:42:51,600
Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid questions. What will we find out this week on Orange

2066
02:42:51,600 --> 02:42:58,720
Lounge Radio? Perhaps a question we will find the answer to is why Jamie is smiling when

2067
02:42:58,720 --> 02:43:06,060
she comes out of the bathroom. I am still going to kick you. She's going to cut you.

2068
02:43:06,060 --> 02:43:08,060
I'm gonna squeeze the ferret to death.

2069
02:43:36,060 --> 02:43:37,340
It does happen once in a while.

2070
02:43:37,340 --> 02:43:38,700
It's just not a regular thing.

2071
02:43:38,700 --> 02:43:40,220
The cage match is long enough as it is.

2072
02:43:40,220 --> 02:43:43,580
We don't want to add another song to it.

2073
02:43:43,580 --> 02:43:45,840
NintendoManiac64 also wants to know, we're going to have

2074
02:43:45,840 --> 02:43:47,420
time for some more Skype, right?

2075
02:43:47,420 --> 02:43:49,340
I just downloaded it and got it working, and I'm, like,

2076
02:43:49,340 --> 02:43:52,620
uber excited for it.

2077
02:43:52,620 --> 02:43:54,620
Maybe.

2078
02:43:54,620 --> 02:43:57,580
Jaded2005 says, oh, this is actually a good question.

2079
02:43:57,580 --> 02:44:01,380
Jaded2005 wants to know, how did you first get into DDR?

2080
02:44:04,580 --> 02:44:05,760
May I?

2081
02:44:05,760 --> 02:44:09,160
I was going to Anime Expo

2082
02:44:09,160 --> 02:44:13,280
and this was in 96

2083
02:44:13,280 --> 02:44:16,680
no no no no it was after that it was like 98

2084
02:44:16,680 --> 02:44:20,600
was my first Anime Expo and I got into Busta Move right after that

2085
02:44:20,600 --> 02:44:26,280
and then I went to Anime Expo the next year which was

2086
02:44:26,280 --> 02:44:30,400
AX99 and someone had the first DDR for Playstation there

2087
02:44:30,400 --> 02:44:34,160
and I was in the middle of the Busta Move 2 tournament which really pissed me off

2088
02:44:34,160 --> 02:44:39,160
off because I was beating everybody for a solid hour, and then decimated my first guy,

2089
02:44:39,160 --> 02:44:45,640
got to the second guy, and got a faulty controller. I was also cosplaying Shorty that year. But

2090
02:44:45,640 --> 02:44:48,780
I thought it was really cool because I heard Casey and the Sunshine Band, and so I had

2091
02:44:48,780 --> 02:44:53,640
to get my own copy. So I got my first DDR that I ever owned, was like a burn of the

2092
02:44:53,640 --> 02:45:00,160
first one, and then I got a DDR for Dreamcast. And then I played my first machine at the

2093
02:45:00,160 --> 02:45:08,160
the next AX, which was a third mix. So AX 2000 was my first machine, and AX 99 was my

2094
02:45:08,160 --> 02:45:13,960
first time playing DDR. But I actually got, I actually played BeatMania before that, and

2095
02:45:13,960 --> 02:45:19,320
I played Dance Dance Dance, which sucked. The first time I ever saw DDR was at Milpitas

2096
02:45:19,320 --> 02:45:23,680
Golf Land, and it was the same weekend I lost my virginity. Just thought you'd like to know.

2097
02:45:23,680 --> 02:45:29,400
Can you describe that to us in detail? Yes, actually, at first, no, I'm not going to.

2098
02:45:29,400 --> 02:45:32,400
You can't describe your DDR experience? That's what I was asking you.

2099
02:45:32,400 --> 02:45:33,400
I'm sure you were.

2100
02:45:33,400 --> 02:45:36,400
I mean, why would I ask you to describe your first experience anal sex-wise?

2101
02:45:36,400 --> 02:45:37,400
Shut up!

2102
02:45:37,400 --> 02:45:40,400
God, take his mic away. Do it.

2103
02:45:40,400 --> 02:45:43,400
This time, don't give it back. This time, don't give it back.

2104
02:45:43,400 --> 02:45:50,400
How I got into DDR was I moved in with my roommate.

2105
02:45:50,400 --> 02:45:56,400
I was a fan of me. I saw BeatMania one year and DDR the next year.

2106
02:45:56,400 --> 02:46:05,400
I have a whole pile of 5 key beatmanias that I don't play.

2107
02:46:26,400 --> 02:46:32,400
Never. Never. Never. I said I don't shave my genitals.

2108
02:46:32,400 --> 02:46:36,400
It's not a shave. Stop it. Who gave him the mic back? Who? Who did that?

2109
02:46:36,400 --> 02:46:41,400
Loki did. You were responsible for keeping the microphone safe from his blasphemy.

2110
02:46:41,400 --> 02:46:44,400
Sakarina also wants to know, can Mr. Spanky get back on the show soon?

2111
02:46:44,400 --> 02:46:48,400
Blast for me, blast for you. Yes, Mr. Spanky can come back on the show someday, yes?

2112
02:46:48,400 --> 02:46:52,400
I don't know about soon. We don't want him to jump the shark, but he'll be back.

2113
02:46:52,400 --> 02:46:53,400
back.

2114
02:46:53,400 --> 02:46:54,560
We need Betty to come.

2115
02:46:54,560 --> 02:46:59,640
Sacrina also wants to know, can Exeterfer get the mic back and start another sex-related

2116
02:46:59,640 --> 02:47:00,640
joke for this week?

2117
02:47:00,640 --> 02:47:01,640
No, he can't.

2118
02:47:01,640 --> 02:47:02,640
No.

2119
02:47:02,640 --> 02:47:06,680
You can next week.

2120
02:47:06,680 --> 02:47:11,280
Tomo Koon wants to know, what's your worst homecoming memory?

2121
02:47:11,280 --> 02:47:15,080
Junior homecoming, which I showed up for 30 minutes.

2122
02:47:15,080 --> 02:47:19,120
My date had a mullet and I left.

2123
02:47:19,120 --> 02:47:21,600
I actually don't have negative homecoming stories to tell.

2124
02:47:21,600 --> 02:47:25,800
I, for the most part, they were pretty good. You know, I first kissed a girl my freshman year at homecoming.

2125
02:47:25,800 --> 02:47:28,320
I had this flu for prom.

2126
02:47:28,320 --> 02:47:31,600
Why are you laughing at that, Extover?

2127
02:47:31,600 --> 02:47:33,640
Because...

2128
02:47:33,640 --> 02:47:38,360
I just want to know what went through that girl's mind when she kissed you.

2129
02:47:38,360 --> 02:47:44,800
Like, oh, that's more of a friend. That's not a boyfriend.

2130
02:47:44,800 --> 02:47:46,120
Like...

2131
02:47:46,120 --> 02:47:48,680
I don't know. My mind.

2132
02:47:48,680 --> 02:47:51,400
It's gone. Anyways, um...

2133
02:47:51,400 --> 02:47:55,400
No, actually, my ex, she sucked because she was...

2134
02:47:55,400 --> 02:47:56,760
She wouldn't put out.

2135
02:47:56,760 --> 02:48:11,440
Well, that too, but no, she was kind of, she played soccer and she, like, injured her knee, like, four fucking years ago or something like that, and so, for whatever reason, it conveniently acted up whenever, you know, she'd go to a dance and she sucked.

2136
02:48:11,440 --> 02:48:14,160
So, anyways, hell with her.

2137
02:48:14,160 --> 02:48:17,700
Goggle wants to know, on the serious game summit thing, just an aside, apparently my

2138
02:48:17,700 --> 02:48:21,680
uncle is speaking that day on another topic, I'll see if I can persuade him to go to the

2139
02:48:21,680 --> 02:48:22,680
DDR thing.

2140
02:48:22,680 --> 02:48:26,560
Let us know if they're doing like, cause usually those summit type things, they sell CDs or

2141
02:48:26,560 --> 02:48:29,600
something, but they're usually really expensive, but you never know, we might be able to get

2142
02:48:29,600 --> 02:48:30,720
a deal or something.

2143
02:48:30,720 --> 02:48:33,560
So that's cool, um, good luck to your uncle on whatever topic he's speaking on.

2144
02:48:33,560 --> 02:48:36,480
Did you both put on, like, lip gloss before you guys kissed?

2145
02:48:36,480 --> 02:48:37,480
Will you shut up?

2146
02:48:37,480 --> 02:48:38,480
Oh my god!

2147
02:48:38,480 --> 02:48:39,480
Loki!

2148
02:48:39,480 --> 02:48:40,480
Let's kiss!

2149
02:48:40,480 --> 02:48:41,480
Loki!

2150
02:48:41,480 --> 02:48:42,480
Hold on to this.

2151
02:48:42,480 --> 02:48:43,480
Put on my lip gloss!

2152
02:48:43,480 --> 02:48:48,360
the mic away. My name is Rob Roberts. Kiss me. I'm just going to unplug him from the

2153
02:48:48,360 --> 02:48:55,360
board so he can't speak. Matt's got it back. And you're giving him his own show? Shame

2154
02:48:55,360 --> 02:49:00,000
on you. You know what? I don't have to be here. Nobody has to listen if they don't want

2155
02:49:00,000 --> 02:49:07,000
to. But if... Actually, extrovert looks all offended. Here's the thing though. If extrovert

2156
02:49:07,000 --> 02:49:18,540
Here's the thing though, if Extra Real Show gets lower ratings than Diversion did, which

2157
02:49:18,540 --> 02:49:22,660
is going to be very hard to do, if Extra Real Show gets lower ratings than Diversion did,

2158
02:49:22,660 --> 02:49:24,660
you are getting cancelled.

2159
02:49:24,660 --> 02:49:30,020
No, you're not taking the mic, it's my mic.

2160
02:49:30,020 --> 02:49:33,620
Goggle has a serious question.

2161
02:49:33,620 --> 02:49:39,620
I want to Skype in, but I have no microphone. Where can I get one, and how much should I expect to pay for one?

2162
02:49:39,620 --> 02:49:40,620
Radio Shack, $5.

2163
02:49:40,620 --> 02:49:49,620
Yeah, they're actually really cheap. You can get a nice little headset at Target for $19.99, and that would be like headphones with a little mic thing, which is good for TeamSpeak and stuff.

2164
02:49:49,620 --> 02:49:55,620
Actually, Office Depot was clearing out the Alta Glancing ones for $10, and Alta Glancing is really good.

2165
02:49:55,620 --> 02:50:01,300
really good. Shop around. If you're interested in buying on the internet, check out Google's

2166
02:50:01,300 --> 02:50:03,940
search thing. I know that's kind of ironic that I'm telling you to go to Google, but

2167
02:50:03,940 --> 02:50:08,940
they have that compare prices thing that's really cool. I recommend if you're going to

2168
02:50:08,940 --> 02:50:16,660
buy a computer thing, make it a brand name like Logitech or something. Greeny wants to

2169
02:50:16,660 --> 02:50:21,140
know, do any of you play double mode? Have you rolled up the king yet? Can you substitute

2170
02:50:21,140 --> 02:50:25,340
sound effects to bleep out profanity in the future? Question number one, do any of you

2171
02:50:25,340 --> 02:50:28,340
I used to, but I'm too fat now.

2172
02:50:28,340 --> 02:50:30,340
Dark Soccer, you used to play on Double Mode too, right? Still do?

2173
02:50:30,340 --> 02:50:34,340
Actually, I used to do nothing but doubles for a little while.

2174
02:50:34,340 --> 02:50:35,340
That's all I play.

2175
02:50:35,340 --> 02:50:37,340
Loki? Yeah, you play a lot of doubles, Loki.

2176
02:50:37,340 --> 02:50:43,340
Yeah, even now that I have, like, no stamina, I still play doubles, because singles just not for me.

2177
02:50:43,340 --> 02:50:45,340
Ironic, we all play doubles. That's kind of weird.

2178
02:50:45,340 --> 02:50:47,340
It's not at home, because, you know, I don't...

2179
02:50:47,340 --> 02:50:49,340
Yeah, not at home. I'll only do it in the arcade.

2180
02:50:49,340 --> 02:50:50,340
That's kind of weird.

2181
02:50:50,340 --> 02:50:54,340
Uh, have you rolled up the king yet? No, in fact, I haven't played Katamari Damacy in a little while.

2182
02:50:54,340 --> 02:50:57,620
I have had no time to play.

2183
02:50:57,620 --> 02:51:01,780
I'm gonna play the Japanese version for some reason. Can you substitute sound effects to

2184
02:51:01,780 --> 02:51:03,700
bleep out profanity in the future? Dude,

2185
02:51:03,700 --> 02:51:07,020
it's the motherfucking internet and we're gonna say what we want. And we don't have a delay.

2186
02:51:07,020 --> 02:51:08,580
Yeah, we don't have a delay or anything either.

2187
02:51:08,580 --> 02:51:13,060
Yeah, and you know who we would put in charge

2188
02:51:13,060 --> 02:51:16,100
of the delay if we had one? Exover.

2189
02:51:16,100 --> 02:51:22,900
And you know that wouldn't work. Ron Chan wants to know how come you guys don't play

2190
02:51:22,900 --> 02:51:27,620
the full versions of the songs that are in DDR, 2DX, and so forth.

2191
02:51:27,620 --> 02:51:28,620
The reason why...

2192
02:51:28,620 --> 02:51:29,620
We have.

2193
02:51:29,620 --> 02:51:33,780
We have in the past, and you hear that sometimes on the spin-off shows, but there's only been

2194
02:51:33,780 --> 02:51:37,340
one lately, and she likes to play non-DDR stuff on her show.

2195
02:51:37,340 --> 02:51:38,420
But she will once in a while, right?

2196
02:51:38,420 --> 02:51:42,260
I actually have done odd-but-money shows, and I've played the long versions.

2197
02:51:42,260 --> 02:51:45,980
And every so often I sneak in the Korean stuff.

2198
02:51:45,980 --> 02:51:50,340
If we played them on this show, our breaks would be really long, and we want to make

2199
02:51:50,340 --> 02:51:53,900
sure it's a lot of talking you know to want to keep the music minimal um we'll

2200
02:51:53,900 --> 02:51:57,880
do it occasionally though I'm tuned in maybe on maybe that's an idea for my

2201
02:51:57,880 --> 02:52:00,460
spin-off show I'll play nothing but long version of the money songs that might be

2202
02:52:00,460 --> 02:52:08,560
cool so we'll see um good yeah SSJ 100 Matt wants to know which would you

2203
02:52:08,560 --> 02:52:14,700
rather see remade on a next-gen console chrono trigger or Final Fantasy 7

2204
02:52:14,700 --> 02:52:19,820
neither guardian legend yeah guardian legend but if I had to choose between

2205
02:52:19,820 --> 02:52:24,820
between the two? Yeah, if I had to choose between the two. I would say Final Fantasy VII so that it actually looks good.

2206
02:52:24,820 --> 02:52:42,820
Because Chrono Trigger was already perfect. I'm going to say Chrono Trigger because I did not get into Chrono Trigger when it was on the Super Nintendo. I never got what the big deal was about Chrono Trigger. I mean, it was cool and all, but I did not nearly obsess over that game. I think a remake might help kick my ass a little bit into giving it a second look.

2207
02:52:42,820 --> 02:52:46,820
I've beaten Chrono Trigger. I've gotten like 7 of the 14 endings.

2208
02:52:47,820 --> 02:52:51,820
I got the Toriyama ending. That was pretty cool.

2209
02:52:53,820 --> 02:52:58,820
Anybody else want to share what they would see remade on the next gen console? Chrono Trigger or Final Fantasy 7?

2210
02:52:58,820 --> 02:53:00,820
Both can be remade anyways.

2211
02:53:01,820 --> 02:53:06,820
Chrono Trigger is going to be an MMO and Final Fantasy 7 is being remade for the PS3, so you'll get them both.

2212
02:53:06,820 --> 02:53:10,820
Leadfoot wants to know, should I buy In the Groove or just stick with DDR Extreme 2?

2213
02:53:10,820 --> 02:53:11,820
DDR.

2214
02:53:11,820 --> 02:53:17,820
Well, if you are choosing between those two, buy Extreme 2, definitely.

2215
02:53:17,820 --> 02:53:22,820
If you're just kind of bored with Extreme 2 and you want a new game, I'm cool with In The Groove.

2216
02:53:22,820 --> 02:53:23,820
Pump It Up.

2217
02:53:23,820 --> 02:53:28,820
Oh yeah, Pump It Up first though, honestly. Buy Pump It Up before you buy In The Groove.

2218
02:53:28,820 --> 02:53:30,820
Seriously, Pump It Up is a great game.

2219
02:53:30,820 --> 02:53:32,820
If you get bored of those, go play Step Mania.

2220
02:53:32,820 --> 02:53:37,820
Then you could buy In The Groove. In The Groove will hold you over. It will.

2221
02:53:37,820 --> 02:53:43,420
here. Zaku says here's a cool fact about this weekend's DDR tournament. No more

2222
02:53:43,420 --> 02:53:47,040
questions guys. No more questions. Final call for questions. Here's a cool

2223
02:53:47,040 --> 02:53:50,080
fact about this weekend's CDR tournament that you probably didn't know. There was

2224
02:53:50,080 --> 02:53:53,140
one event called Ironman in which you had to do an Oni course without the bar.

2225
02:53:53,140 --> 02:53:57,420
It was done on a DDR machine ghetto rigged to a PS2. Both screen and pad so folks

2226
02:53:57,420 --> 02:54:01,540
had to do max period on an arcade pad.

2227
02:54:01,540 --> 02:54:10,180
Ron Chan says, do you like this as the name of your spin-off show, The Sky Effect?

2228
02:54:10,180 --> 02:54:15,020
I liked, somebody suggested This Week in Sky as a parody of This Week in Tech.

2229
02:54:15,020 --> 02:54:20,860
I should do This Week in Sky, although it would sound like something that would be exploring

2230
02:54:20,860 --> 02:54:24,020
like me, and I don't know about that.

2231
02:54:24,020 --> 02:54:25,620
The Life Aquatic with Rob Robber.

2232
02:54:25,620 --> 02:54:27,940
How about we've blown it sky-high.

2233
02:54:27,940 --> 02:54:33,940
All right, we're done with that.

2234
02:54:33,940 --> 02:54:35,620
You know, I'm not going to say anything crude.

2235
02:54:35,620 --> 02:54:39,740
I just thought that The Life Aquatic, starring Rob Roberts, would be a good title.

2236
02:54:39,740 --> 02:54:41,220
The Life Bemonic.

2237
02:54:41,220 --> 02:54:42,220
The Life Bemonic.

2238
02:54:42,220 --> 02:54:43,220
Yeah.

2239
02:54:43,220 --> 02:54:45,860
And my show is not going to be crude, by the way.

2240
02:54:45,860 --> 02:54:49,580
I mean, I may say some crude things, but just listen in.

2241
02:54:49,580 --> 02:54:50,580
It'll be fun.

2242
02:54:50,580 --> 02:54:51,580
All right.

2243
02:54:51,580 --> 02:54:53,860
Say something good about it, Rob.

2244
02:54:53,860 --> 02:55:00,860
going to be fabulous. When I say fabulous, I mean stupid. I'm just kidding. It's going

2245
02:55:02,180 --> 02:55:08,560
to be interesting. It's going to be interesting. Cool. Like picking your nose and eating it.

2246
02:55:08,560 --> 02:55:15,560
That's interesting too. I'd rather do a Brazilian wax jar. Alright. It's 9.30. We've got to

2247
02:55:16,860 --> 02:55:20,300
get a final look. I'm just picking you in, Joke. Final thoughts. Angel, your final thought.

2248
02:55:20,300 --> 02:55:24,780
Nice for being here and not filling this show with sexual innuendo like Extrofer.

2249
02:55:24,780 --> 02:55:25,780
Why would I?

2250
02:55:25,780 --> 02:55:26,780
Except for that water sports thing.

2251
02:55:26,780 --> 02:55:27,780
That was hella gross.

2252
02:55:27,780 --> 02:55:31,380
That was his fault.

2253
02:55:31,380 --> 02:55:34,860
What's your final thought?

2254
02:55:34,860 --> 02:55:36,500
My PC must work.

2255
02:55:36,500 --> 02:55:39,580
Extrofer, your final thought.

2256
02:55:39,580 --> 02:55:42,880
Orange Lounge Radio a week from tomorrow.

2257
02:55:42,880 --> 02:55:46,500
Extrofer's case of the Mondays.

2258
02:55:46,500 --> 02:55:49,140
You'll have it.

2259
02:55:49,140 --> 02:55:50,500
I might catch something else.

2260
02:55:50,500 --> 02:55:54,660
Queer guy's voice with a straight guy's ear.

2261
02:55:54,660 --> 02:55:55,140
And girls.

2262
02:55:55,140 --> 02:55:56,380
Loki, your final thought.

2263
02:55:59,900 --> 02:56:03,860
You should name your show Bad Dude with Sky.

2264
02:56:03,860 --> 02:56:07,100
Are you a bad enough dude to eat a cheeseburger?

2265
02:56:07,100 --> 02:56:09,380
I'll just call my show The Guardian Legend.

2266
02:56:09,380 --> 02:56:11,620
Awesome.

2267
02:56:11,620 --> 02:56:16,060
My final thought is I'm sorry that we didn't get to open up

2268
02:56:16,060 --> 02:56:17,500
the Skype line again.

2269
02:56:17,500 --> 02:56:21,500
We ran out of time, by talking about us and fucking letting Christopher talk.

2270
02:56:23,500 --> 02:56:24,500
Just kidding.

2271
02:56:24,500 --> 02:56:26,500
DarkSanka, your final thought?

2272
02:56:27,500 --> 02:56:32,500
Reject false icons and remember it's down the road, not across the street, kids. Do it right.

2273
02:56:33,500 --> 02:56:40,500
That's it. One word of the show to sum everything up. One word. Final word of the show. Angel, I'm going to give it to you. Final word. What is it?

2274
02:56:41,500 --> 02:56:43,500
Water sports. Wow.

2275
02:56:43,500 --> 02:56:50,500
That does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live.

2276
02:56:50,500 --> 02:56:55,500

And now, here is your fortune cookie message of the day.

2279
02:57:33,500 --> 02:57:37,500
This is the only way

2280
02:57:37,500 --> 02:57:43,500
And to rest your games through

2281
02:57:43,500 --> 02:57:49,500
Cause now you have to answer to

2282
02:57:49,500 --> 02:57:52,500
America

2283
02:57:52,500 --> 02:57:55,500
Fuck yeah

2284
02:57:55,500 --> 02:57:58,500
America

2285
02:57:58,500 --> 02:58:08,700
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.

2286
02:58:28,500 --> 02:58:51,900
End of line.

2287
02:58:51,900 --> 02:58:52,900
That's it.

2288
02:58:52,900 --> 02:58:54,900
Show's over.

2289
02:58:54,900 --> 02:59:01,180
the stream in about 15 seconds for Bimani music and video game music. Thanks for listening!
