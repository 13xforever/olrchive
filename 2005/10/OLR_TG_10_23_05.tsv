390	2832	Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, week of October 24th, 2005.
2932	14022	You're tuned in to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your podcast home for all the latest video game news and gamer chat.
14322	17845	Now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.
19407	28034	Hello, everybody out there in iTunes or iPod or whatever you're using to download our podcast, maybe one of those websites out there.
29241	31703	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
52656	54117	Yes, our webpage.
54217	56878	OrangeLaundry.com or the OLRPSP site?
57178	57998	OLRPSP.
58578	62559	The problem is I don't know how to program in said languages that I'm programming in.
62860	65180	And so, yeah, it's a little difficult.
65240	66561	It's kind of a learning experience.
66641	69162	You must be trying to cook up some cool stuff for the site.
69402	69742	Of course.
69902	70202	All right.
70322	70722	Sounds good.
70782	71242	Check that out.
71362	72643	OLRPSP.com.
72663	73523	It's our new site.
74164	75224	Just for the PSPs.
75244	81087	I mean, you can bring it up on like Internet Explorer or Firefox, but seriously, it's really made for your PSP.
81107	82607	It looks so much better on a PSP.
83088	85228	Like if you bring it up in Firefox, you're going to go, what the heck?
85248	85849	This doesn't look right.
87669	88830	But on a PSP, it looks great.
89450	90330	High def and everything.
90371	90751	It's awesome.
90791	95473	Yeah, we're working on something that's kind of with the theme of the normal station that is, you know...
97273	104215	Getting our listeners to basically give us feedback and just a whole way of connecting with our listeners.
104555	105015	Absolutely.
105415	111076	So actually, we also have the Orange Lounge Radio message line, which just opened up on our website for our live show.
111156	113137	So we might be using that in our podcast as well.
113257	119938	So it's more interactivity to make this a little bit your show as well, because we appreciate you guys tuning in and taking the time to listen.
120599	121819	So it's just Loki and I tonight.
121879	123839	Nobody else wanted to come.
124359	126020	Nobody else wanted to be on the podcast.
126220	126720	No, it's cool.
127728	130110	We got a little bit of news to talk about tonight.
130150	135954	But first, we always talk about how our gaming week was, what we've been playing, and what's new in our gaming world.
135974	136574	Because you know what?
136594	137335	We're geeks too.
137715	138576	Loki, what have you been playing?
139481	141702	I have been playing a couple things.
141882	146025	First, I started off with Burnout because I had to get the rest of Burnout out of my system.
146765	150567	And then I've got my new baby, and that would be The Warriors.
151167	151788	The Warriors?
151888	152748	I've never even heard of this.
152788	153308	What's this about?
153568	157430	The Warriors is a game based on the 1979 movie starring Michael Beck.
157831	160552	It's basically about the gangs of New York.
162053	164254	Not like the Martin Scorsese gangs in New York?
164314	165094	No, no, no.
165354	166795	This is about gangs during 1979.
166835	166935	Okay.
168732	174173	Think really cheesy themed gangs like you have a gang called the Baseball Furies that are dressed up like baseball players.
174193	177274	You have a gang of like mime looking people.
177314	179154	When you're a jet, you know you're a jet.
179194	180374	Seriously, it's like that.
180695	183975	It's very similar to that, but it's just so cheesy and cool.
184415	185335	The game is really awesome.
185375	189836	It's kind of like a Final Fight type game where you just beat up everything, but they actually have a story to it.
189896	197318	It actually takes place three months before the events of the movie, then the very end of the game goes through the events of the movie, because basically the story of the movie is that
197873	205740	There's this one guy who's calling all these gangs together to unite them because they outnumber the police and are basically going to take over New York.
206661	218973	Well, this other gang frames the warriors and they kill the guy, and so now everybody's out to kill you, and so you have to get back to your home turf of Coney Island before you get beaten to death.
219301	220002	Xbox Live on Xbox?
220042	220122	No.
220142	221102	Oh, bummer.
221142	222924	Yeah, but it's really awesome.
243226	247711	and then this next week in a few days here I'll be picking up Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories.
247791	248732	That's coming out very soon.
248832	250834	Which I'm very excited about that one.
251014	255079	Speaking of Xbox, did you know Xbox Live is going to be, I know not that you care because you don't really play Xbox Live, right?
255099	255779	I don't have an Xbox.
256660	258422	Oh, I thought you got one finally.
258723	260264	Okay, but you're going to be getting a 360, right?
260284	260544	Yeah.
260965	263788	So are you going to buy any old Xbox games to kind of catch up on what you missed?
265075	266035	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
287759	316398	and so I guess you know I was kind of trying to look into and during our three hour show earlier this week we were kind of talking to some of our listeners trying to get feedback on how the new Xbox 360 what their thoughts are on it and it sounds like you're going to be actually able to change your gamer tag whenever you want on the new 360 it's tied to your passport you know the whole Microsoft passport thing they're integrating that into the 360 it sounds like so that's kind of what we're hearing well that's cool at least in that way you can have a gamer tag you know that other people might have and
317458	317738	I don't know.
317898	318379	That'd be interesting.
318399	318979	Well, maybe.
319039	323783	I mean, I don't know if we can duplicate names still, but... As long as I can keep my old one, I guess that's okay.
324103	324323	Yeah.
324343	325404	I don't know.
325424	328727	Even though I don't... There's better names I would have liked, but oh well.
329827	331829	Anyway, anything else you've been playing in your game week?
332590	332810	Really?
332970	333210	No.
333450	339595	I've been just trying to play some of... I'm trying to... I have Shadow of Colossus, but I haven't gotten a chance to play it yet.
340155	343778	And so I want to check that one out and maybe Tony Hawk's American Wasteland.
344238	346280	But I haven't gotten a chance to play him yet.
347389	347810	Real life?
349134	352344	Yeah, real life and just web page crap.
352624	353146	All right, all right.
354140	357161	My gaming week actually has been pretty mellow.
357301	360802	It's been mostly World of Warcraft, which I talked about on last week's show.
360842	363462	I went out and got it, and it was this big, oh, Rob got World of Warcraft.
363803	367303	But I've been playing it, and I've been giving it a fair chance and kind of checking it out, seeing what I think of it.
367744	370564	And you know, I actually kind of like it.
370824	380967	It's a lot better than I thought it would be, because you know, remember guys, I played Final Fantasy XI for like two years, so of course I hear nothing but smack talking about World of Warcraft, but one thing I'm learning about
381789	388733	The MMOs as I'm playing World of Warcraft is, it really is just a much different game than Final Fantasy XI.
388773	394556	It's very different and it has a whole lot of different things to offer and it's not necessarily better or worse.
394657	402221	It's just that even though World of Warcraft and Final Fantasy XI and let's take some of the other big ones too, Guild Wars and Ragnarok.
402659	403439	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
423445	426647	because Guild Wars is practically set up so that you don't even have to ever play with anybody.
427007	429068	And you don't play a monthly fee with Guild Wars.
429648	440614	Not that I think Guild Wars is necessarily the strongest game, nor is it my favorite out of the three, but I think it's probably the most accessible and most non-shocking.
441415	445617	The game is kind of set up very similar to a single-player experience, if you want it to be.
446777	449459	But as far as Final Fantasy XI and World of Warcraft, I'm just noticing...
449915	450835	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
468380	476843	Like, if you're looking for a game that you want to do, like, some, you know, role-playing, or you just want to, you know, do quests and big things with friends and stuff, I think Final Fantasy is probably the more social game.
477183	479784	But World of Warcraft has its own strengths as well.
479804	487806	I think there's a lot of things that make World of Warcraft a little less tedious of a game to be playing sometimes, because seriously, Final Fantasy XI feels like a second job sometimes.
488186	490867	It can get that intricate, and World of Warcraft doesn't feel that way at all.
490907	493168	World of Warcraft is a little more, you know, relaxed.
493388	496089	So I'm just kind of learning about all the differences between the game, but I think all in all,
496894	509135	I like World of Warcraft and I would recommend it if you are I mean obviously probably most of you guys already have it I'm really a late bloomer when it comes to this game just because I've been focused on one MMO for so long um
510447	514930	But if you have an interest in the game and you think it sounds like something you'd like, check it out.
515490	519493	I think you'll find it's really different than the other MMOs out there, except for Guild Wars.
519513	521695	Because Guild Wars and World of Warcraft have a lot in common.
521715	522215	They really do.
522895	524316	Just in the game, the way it plays.
524416	526178	To me, it feels very similar.
526498	530961	I think World of Warcraft has a lot more than Guild Wars.
531041	532522	About 40 more levels, for one.
533082	536485	And more crafting and stuff you can do that I think makes it a little more...
538710	541253	A little longer gameplay than Guild Wars would be.
541613	544275	Still haven't played Final Fantasy yet, again.
544956	548719	Still waiting for that time to come in, but it's not there.
548799	552122	I think I'm just on a cool-off period from Final Fantasy XI for a little while myself.
552182	553804	I need to just take a step back.
554605	563873	I'm not saying I dislike the game at all, I still think it's an awesome game, and I love it a lot, and I'll probably get back into it once the 360 and Treasures of Adorgan expansions kind of,
564676	565057	I don't
582384	583004	No, if it is.
583204	584245	I'm not sure if it is.
584265	592767	Well, you know, I heard it's not going to support the voice chat, because the voice chat's going to be unmoderated, which doesn't make sense to me, because... Oh, I wouldn't want voice chat anyways.
594627	596728	Imagine Final Fantasy XI voice chat.
596768	597248	I've done it.
597768	599209	TeamSpeak.
599549	601029	Or Ventrilo, or one of those things.
601349	602530	Yeah, but, okay.
603370	606891	That works fine when you have a group of people, but what if you have the world?
607051	607891	No, thank you.
607951	608651	Okay, I gotcha.
608952	609952	But, no, the whole thing is...
611055	617640	I just hope it's supported, period, because then that way I can cancel my PlayOnLive account and just move it all over to the Xbox Live.
617700	621703	I have this feeling it's going to be set up like PSO where you have to pay for both, and that's going to be sad.
622264	628068	Because with Phantasy Star Online on Xbox, you have to pay not just the Xbox Live, but then you pay the Sega fee of like $8 as well.
628569	628889	Sucks.
629630	631411	Well, still, they're going to have a break, I'm sure.
631431	632332	Yeah, we'll see.
633052	633933	I hope so, I hope so.
635229	639592	All right, let's get into some gaming news tonight, talk about some things going on in the gaming world.
640112	647718	Speaking of the Xbox 360, Walmart and EB Games and some other stores are starting to get the little Xbox 360 kiosks.
648378	655803	I haven't seen any show up, but there's some websites set up that you can just go on to some of the major gaming portals.
655823	657104	You can probably find some websites.
657424	660366	that have these lists set up of where all these gaming kiosks are.
660386	660946	They have lists.
660966	663828	They even have a Google Map thing that's set up for it.
663948	666970	But honestly, chances are it's going to be in the mall near you at some point.
667010	667490	Let me put it this way.
667510	671473	They're going to be rolled out to almost every store in over three weeks.
671553	672913	I mean, they're shipping them out right now.
672993	675315	Yeah, obviously Microsoft's pushing this thing like crazy.
675475	677056	It's going to be in your local store soon enough.
677076	680458	But if you just have to be first, get on the Internet and look.
680720	684823	I checked our local Walmart today because I just happened to be there, and no, they didn't have them.
685023	686584	I'm not a big Walmart fan myself.
686924	695350	I'm more of a Target guy, so... Yeah, it's only a couple demos, and honestly, this is coming out in a few weeks anyways.
695651	696151	I can wait.
696502	696982	I know, I know.
697022	697823	That's kind of where I'm at, too.
697843	698423	I'm like, you know what?
698443	703125	I'll just wait and have my own, and then I'll have to stand in line, and I'll have little kids looking over my shoulder.
703365	709228	That's what really annoys me, when little kids are looking over my shoulder, like if I am in a place like Walmart or Target playing one of those, and the little kids are looking over my shoulder.
709628	710309	What are you doing?
710409	711089	How do you do that?
711189	711629	How do you do that?
711649	712209	What do you do that?
712409	713250	How do you do that?
713450	714010	How do you do that?
714270	714711	What's that?
714851	715251	What's that?
715771	716451	Are you going to get this?
716631	717272	Are you going to buy this?
718132	718953	Sure, I might buy this.
718973	723095	Not that it's going to do you a damn bit of good, but kids are funny.
725990	726871	Let's go to another system.
726891	730472	Let's talk a little bit about the PSP, which has shipped 10 million units.
730592	737115	That's what officials from Sony are announcing, that they have reached 10 million units, of course, this being worldwide.
737875	746778	183 PSP software titles currently out, a total of 19.6 million units of software shipped, and then 15 million UMD movies.
746838	751480	That's kind of crazy, because that means almost just as many UMD movies have shipped as games.
752120	753181	And you know what's also crazy about it?
753401	753861	If 10 million...
754921	760983	PSPs have shipped, then that means like most people only own like one game.
763124	764164	And probably it's Luminous.
764384	765405	Probably one or two games.
765765	766565	It's probably Luminous.
767145	767665	It's one of them.
768486	769186	Well, I don't know.
769606	770807	Everybody I know, it's Luminous.
771007	772687	And honestly, it is the best PSP game out there.
772887	775128	I'm probably just not impressed with the games though right now like I am.
775188	777249	I mean, it's just... I haven't bought it.
777709	777889	I had...
778908	782230	I don't even remember the last PSP game I bought, other than Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories.
782870	790694	Everything I've gotten has been passed down free from publishers, and I wouldn't have even bought them if they hadn't given it to me, because I'm just unimpressed by everything that's coming out.
790715	794397	There just hasn't really been a title that's been like, I have to really get that.
794417	796438	And I'm kind of seeing that in the new Katamari PSP.
796478	799019	I'm like, oh, I definitely want to get that, because I'm in the Katamari franchise.
799039	799479	I'm into that.
800540	804282	But we have yet to see a really solid franchise game hit the PSP.
804322	806083	I mean, granted, we've had Burnout and
806443	811306	We've had Wipeout, I guess, and we've had Metal Gear, but not really the same Metal Gear.
812107	818191	We've had some extent the franchises, but we've really just had no solid franchise title hit the PSP.
818271	818731	You know what I mean?
818951	820092	I think that's kind of what's hurting it.
820312	825716	Whereas on the DS, now you're getting Castlevania, and it's seriously probably the best Castlevania game they've done since Symphony of the Night.
826256	830259	So, you know, it's like DS is starting to look really good with the franchises.
830419	830939	Mario Kart?
831380	833501	Yeah, Mario Kart on the way, and Animal Crossing.
833601	835823	The whole internet connectivity stuff.
836721	838923	So, PSP needs to pick up the pace.
838983	839603	We'll see what happens.
840504	842605	I know PSP's got its loyalists out there, though.
843746	848870	If you have any emails, comments, or suggestions, you know I send us an email to go at orangelaunchradio.com.
848890	851792	Maybe you're a PSP lover wanting to yell at us a little bit.
852072	853133	I don't dislike the PSP.
853393	856855	I think the PSP's a great multi-system, like getting to watch them.
856895	858636	And, you know, that's really what their marketing is.
858697	861438	So, on that end, it's successful that you can watch movies.
861458	862279	I'm not talking about PSP, either.
862299	863880	I mean, I've got two of them.
863940	866282	So, I mean, obviously, I love them, but just...
866902	892665	I love the fact that it's got the wireless internet now and you can download our show on it so it's great for that but the games element alone little weak it's just you know when you see a game like Twisted Metal you're thinking ooh Twisted Metal Black that was an awesome game oh wait this is a port of Twisted Metal 2 a Playstation game oh crap Twisted Metal for the PS3 I know there's gonna be one that's gonna be awesome
893812	900378	But anyway, about the email box, DarkSakura is our mailbox queen, but she's not here tonight, unfortunately, so we're going to go ahead and table mailbox until next week.
900938	903721	But definitely get your emails in to go at orange launch radio dot com.
904568	912870	I was talking a little bit about World of Warcraft earlier, and you know there's an expansion on the horizon, and of course people love to gossip about the expansion packs.
912910	915430	Here's the latest rumors circulating around the internet.
915450	919031	We don't know how true they are, but they seem to be pretty solid leads.
919771	924753	The Burning Crusade, sounds like it's going to be the name of it, and it's going to take place in the Outlands.
924993	927313	They're going to raise the level cap with this expansion to 70.
927433	928573	Some sites are saying 75, but most are saying 70.
931578	932098	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
955684	959186	Maybe next year, because I'm just now getting into World of Warcraft, so maybe next year I'll be ready for BlizzCon.
960367	965190	Anyway, they might do some small upgrades to the graphic engine as well, and they're going to add weather effects, which I think is neat.
965430	968712	And then the other thing I think is neat, cross-server battlegrounds.
969653	970013	So we'll see.
970413	984782	Well, I actually, I was reading, because I was reading an article about this earlier, and they were talking about some of the stuff that they're going to be having, and I could have sworn they actually did name the... Yeah, for Alliance, it's this...
985660	987541	Tra-nai or something like that.
987722	991885	It's D-R-A-E-N-E-I is the race for the alliance.
992225	994207	They have a new class, I guess, Spellbreaker.
995267	998510	They're rumored saying it's going to be race 275.
998950	1002853	Six new areas and nine new high-end instances.
1002953	1007257	So it really just depends on what website you're looking at because everybody's reporting something different at this point.
1007277	1010039	But it seems like, okay, there's going to be a level cap raise.
1010399	1011460	Some little things it looks like.
1011820	1012101	Oh, yeah.
1012161	1012281	But...
1014022	1017404	You know the other big rumor going around about World of Warcraft right now is that it's going to go on the 360.
1018984	1027968	I'm certain Microsoft is really, really hoping for that, because let's face it, World of Warcraft right now is a PC-only title, and not everybody who's into consoles is into PC.
1028128	1028729	I like both.
1029449	1034071	In fact, with Civilization IV coming out this week, this is going to be a big month for PC gaming for me.
1034611	1039273	But, you know, there's folks that don't really cross those lines.
1039293	1042775	They're a PC gamer or they're a console gamer.
1043260	1047703	So if World of Warcraft came out on the 360 or any next-gen console, really, that would be huge.
1049104	1050065	I'd like to see it happen.
1050085	1052487	I think it would be good news, but who knows.
1054428	1061513	So surely you've been following the drama, and I'm sure anybody who listens to this show probably has been following this too, so I don't want to beat a dead horse with this.
1062325	1064428	Penny Arcade vs. Jack Thompson
1077665	1084987	Penny Arcade donated $10,000 because Jack Thompson was like, ha ha, just kidding about the mod thing.
1085027	1088629	He said he was going to give $10,000 to whoever did it and then he said it was a joke.
1088949	1092430	And Penny Arcade put up the $10,000 because Jack Thompson wouldn't do it.
1092830	1098372	And then Jack Thompson basically wrote a letter to the police saying that the Penny Arcade people are harassing him.
1098972	1105374	And then the Penny Arcade people filed something with a legal association to get Jack Thompson investigated.
1105822	1108643	No, what they were doing is they were actually, they sent a letter.
1108823	1110644	I'm completely paraphrasing here.
1111305	1114626	They sent letters to the Florida bar, basically.
1114966	1121890	So Jack Thompson now turns around and files a complaint with the feds and the district attorney, and the rumor is he was calling for a truce.
1122090	1134696	Well, yeah, he's all over the place, and he's emailing the feds and stuff like this, and all his information, I mean, if anybody actually instead of, because anybody's going to do research on this and be like, oh, my God, you know.
1136058	1139081	He's completely nuts because everything he's stating is completely wrong.
1139161	1148610	So, I mean, anybody who does any research on this and doesn't take him for, you know, face value is obviously going to see... He's good at getting publicity, though, because even we're talking about him.
1149210	1150251	Maybe we shouldn't be, I don't know.
1150711	1153034	No, it's just, we've got to point out that he's stupid.
1153074	1154275	That's what I like doing.
1154315	1156877	You've got to point out the retarded people.
1159319	1159880	I hate to say this.
1161034	1166975	There seems to be a lot of politicians coming from Florida that are just retarded.
1167015	1170916	Well, let's not go there because we don't want to get more hate mail from our friends in Florida.
1171576	1172237	Politicians!
1172457	1173617	I don't know, just politicians.
1173877	1174377	Florida's cool.
1176057	1182819	So anyway, if I could offer words of advice to Penny Arcade, finish him.
1187120	1187820	Just honestly...
1188672	1190874	Just let him dig himself his own grave.
1190934	1192515	I mean, because it's going to happen.
1192575	1195917	He's just going to eventually get caught up in so many lies.
1197238	1198399	You know, he'll be over.
1198860	1200781	I have just a small little story on Civilization 4.
1201321	1203123	It's coming out this week, October 25th.
1203203	1205324	And I want to buy this and check it out.
1205344	1207426	You know, I didn't... I loved Civilization 1.
1207806	1208587	Loved Civilization 1.
1208727	1215432	I know I've gone off on a previous podcast about how I think it's probably one of my favorite games of all time, if not my favorite game of all time, is Civilization 1.
1215852	1217053	But I never really got into 2 or 3.
1217454	1218014	It just didn't...
1218382	1222244	have that simpleness, that accessibility of Civilization 1.
1223425	1226787	But Civ 4 is on the horizon, and I'm just excited to at least check it out and see if I like it.
1226807	1231869	And I hear it's going to be really customizable and all this stuff, so it's coming out this week, and I'm curious about it.
1231969	1241134	I definitely... I wish I could rent PC games or something, because I don't want to have to spend $49.99 on it, but it looks like I'm going to have to, so we'll see.
1241935	1244076	I know, I'm like... Oh well, we'll see.
1245237	1246737	Anyway, Loki, what do you have for us tonight?
1246757	1247838	You got some news stories for us?
1248149	1248850	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1267220	1271103	I don't understand the lure of buying games before the system is out anyway.
1271183	1272984	Oh, I'm going to go home and look at the pretty packaging in the book.
1273364	1276466	Is it just to make the lines go faster when the system comes out?
1276566	1277267	I don't know.
1277327	1277807	I don't get it.
1277827	1278367	I think so.
1279308	1282010	Or just so there's not a huge rush on everything.
1282390	1284431	I'm getting my games before they come out just because...
1286658	1288759	Just pick everything up when I get it.
1289159	1290440	And then I'll have the system.
1290940	1292520	And you guys know I didn't reserve my system.
1292960	1295561	So I'm going to be playing the Rush the Crowds game.
1296522	1299523	I did it with the DS and I did it with other systems in the past.
1299563	1301584	I'll do it with the Xbox 360 as well.
1301784	1306005	The whole rumor is that they've been playing up the fact that they're oversold on it.
1306045	1306885	Big shock!
1307026	1309226	Every company says they're oversold when their systems come out.
1309246	1313568	They're saying that that was artificial to increase demand on the system or something like that.
1313668	1313808	But
1314963	1318405	What was that countdown thing you were blogging about earlier this week?
1318425	1320887	There was a countdown on the Xbox 360?
1321047	1321227	Hex 168.
1321747	1323308	Yeah, you talked about it last podcast.
1323628	1329392	Hex 168 is actually this kind of, it's almost like the origin site for the people in the U.S.
1330213	1341420	The thing is, though, you can win an Xbox system, the three Microsoft games, Project Gotham Racing, Cameo, and Perfect Dark, you can win that and a year of Xbox Live.
1342120	1355209	Um, what you have to do, though, is you have to create a short video clip or, um, like a Photoshop of the Hex 168 logo, um, like you saw it somewhere.
1355389	1357230	You know, like, you have to send them pictures.
1357250	1365236	So you have to get creative, you know, doing something like, you know, in California they have the lottery, you know, the mega lottery or whatever it is, and they have, you know, the
1365754	1369777	It looks like a home video camera footage of this giant ticket flying through the air.
1369857	1371458	No, something like that, you know, you have to make.
1371959	1372999	So it's like way too much.
1373159	1379264	So basically, the UK people, they get to just sign up and enter the drawing, but no, we have to actually work for it.
1379284	1382386	I kind of want to say the hand thing with the DS.
1382426	1383507	Yeah, it's like that.
1383627	1386910	They'd mail you a hand if you take a picture for touching as good.
1387570	1388711	I don't know, it kind of reminds me of that.
1388971	1392614	It's just another thing, the giveaway, more 360s.
1393034	1394135	And the win, I guess, you win a
1395330	1397572	A trip to the pre-release party or something like that.
1398093	1398513	Eh, not bad.
1398833	1399974	But, eh.
1400975	1401756	That's what I had to say.
1402116	1403117	Eh, I haven't paid for it.
1403177	1403518	Don't care.
1405039	1405340	Alright.
1406941	1407802	Um, I want to mention this.
1407902	1409043	We'll go back to Loki for some more stories.
1409063	1409604	You have more stories?
1409704	1410845	Yeah, I'm sure I do.
1410965	1412406	Alright, let me get this out first.
1412446	1413147	I want to mention this.
1413187	1416410	Even though it's not necessarily gaming specific...
1417437	1426242	The Senate Commerce Committee made a bill this week that says that in 2009 all transmissions will have to be digital television transmissions.
1426562	1430464	So it looks like HD is going to be the big thing in 2009 at the latest.
1431184	1436587	Of course they will be also doing the subsidization or something in the amount of $3 billion.
1437327	1438608	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
1463174	1475921	But think about this, if your console life is five years, which it seems like most consoles have been lasting about five years on the market, that means that these consoles will need to be ready for this in 2009.
1476581	1483685	And it sounds like the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360 are both HD ready, but is Nintendo listening to this?
1483945	1487427	I hope so, because they said the revolution wouldn't support HDTV.
1488408	1491850	That makes me sad, so I hope they will reconsider in light of this bill.
1492270	1496433	Because by the end of the console life of the revolution, they're going to be in trouble.
1497113	1498614	But I don't think they're going to be in trouble.
1498654	1501696	They won't necessarily be in trouble, but they won't be as cool.
1502237	1504718	I think we still haven't heard everything about the revolution yet.
1504918	1505479	Yeah, I know.
1506139	1514004	I know there's still a lot to come, but the whole HD thing still... I want somebody to come out and say Nintendo Revolution will support HDTV, and then I'll shut my mouth.
1516445	1524807	You know I'm going to buy it no matter what because I'm going to want to play whatever Zelda game and whatever Metroid game and whatever Mario game they put out on it because I'm a consumer whore like that.
1525327	1525547	I know.
1529168	1529348	Yeah.
1529508	1530268	Alright, what else you got?
1531309	1533089	I got this funny site.
1533149	1534349	I was just looking up here.
1535169	1542231	This Chinese site actually was spoofing Nintendogs and they have Nintendogs.
1543131	1544772	It says college girls and friends.
1545752	1545952	So
1546724	1551728	I went and pulled it up and... Do you take the girls out for a walk and you have to clean up their poop?
1552348	1552808	Not quite.
1553229	1555010	It looks like a dating sim type thing.
1555090	1556551	I think this is actually all Photoshopped.
1556591	1557792	Oh god, it sprung too!
1559953	1561374	But it's a funny idea.
1562575	1565517	However, they're never going to go in that market because they're too family friendly.
1565797	1567538	Somebody was very, very bored, apparently.
1567558	1569640	Very bored and very horny, I guess.
1569700	1571721	Whoever made Nintendo Girls, go outside.
1572062	1572462	Seriously.
1573581	1576423	We don't have an advice column tonight because DarkSakura's not here, but that's my advice.
1576603	1578524	If this is you, go outside, please.
1579084	1579465	Seriously.
1579485	1580125	Get some fresh air.
1581226	1587670	The other thing is, Famitsu Magazine put up some pictures of Final Fantasy XII.
1587830	1591432	Which we will be referring to from now on as the sexy Final Fantasy XII.
1592733	1593233	Just kidding.
1593253	1593894	Okay.
1593914	1596515	You have to admit, the screenshots are sexy.
1597276	1601498	They are pretty sexy, but to me it looks like console version of XI, to be honest.
1601918	1602539	I mean, it's
1604054	1607095	Did you play the demo at E3 a couple years ago when they were actually demoing it?
1607315	1617317	I mean, lord knows what's changed in the past two years, but the battle system felt like a fusion of Final Fantasy XI and the old school Final Fantasies, but I don't know, in the past couple years they might have changed that.
1617517	1617917	I don't know.
1618317	1619217	It's hard to tell anymore.
1619618	1621098	They'll probably show it next year, too.
1622018	1625199	It's gonna be like the new Halo 2 of E3.
1625359	1627879	They'll show it like three years in a row without the damn game coming out.
1628500	1630520	Well, you know, I mean, and
1631004	1633345	Dragon Quest VIII is coming around the corner here pretty soon.
1633365	1634726	You're not supposed to have that demo back there.
1634746	1635386	Yes, it is.
1636446	1638107	So, that'll be something to check out.
1638687	1648612	Except I have my whole qualms with Dragon Quest VIII looking exactly like Dragon Ball Z. Granted, I know it's the same artist, but come on.
1649212	1650453	It looks exactly the same.
1650513	1651953	It's just, no.
1653094	1656616	It's like Dragon Ball Z. It even has Dragon in the name.
1656656	1658316	I mean, that's, it's wrong.
1659177	1659877	It's very wrong.
1661824	1665886	I was looking at a story very briefly.
1665946	1668508	It talks about Japan reconsidering the game ratings.
1668868	1671729	They may adopt some stricter standards for 18-plus games.
1671749	1674751	I wonder if that's a paranoia over in this country starting to set in over there.
1675572	1678733	There was basically like an event that happened.
1678773	1684917	It was like a gathering of top industry players, and they had a session, and the topic was video games and their effects on the youth.
1686638	1690880	And in a proposal by government representatives, which was kind of similar to what was going on here,
1691680	1709708	They put forward an initiative that said that there would be a distinct indication of games' contents on the packaging to change the CERO 18 rating to something that is recommended for 18 and over to prohibited for under 18.
1710789	1717952	So then they came out and these companies got together and it sounds like Square Enix president Yoichi Wada said,
1718691	1724952	actually told the group that there was still a need for more studies to be done on the game's influence of children.
1724992	1729133	So, kind of almost the same battle that's going on over here is going on in Japan right now.
1729353	1729993	Very interesting.
1731993	1733434	One more thing I was going to mention here.
1735694	1738575	Gizmondo launched in the US, apparently.
1738595	1739135	Oh, that's right.
1739995	1743295	And the reviews for it have been... I've heard some pretty negative reviews.
1743315	1744016	Pretty bad.
1744116	1746396	Yeah, I've heard that it's getting some negative reviews.
1746952	1748533	E3, SSX3, FIFA 2005, Sticky Balls
1769963	1797598	Which whatever the hell that is Doesn't sound like something I want to be walking to the counter with The other bad things about the Gizmondo When you turn it on it takes 40 seconds to boot The other thing is In order to turn it off you have to actually go through this menu Almost like Windows and you have to hit shut down The other thing though is it's available in two versions One for $2.29 which is being sold right now And then you have the premium version which is selling for $3.39
1800284	1804406	The 229 version, you get ads sent to your Gizmondo.
1804887	1810289	And in order to shut off your Gizmondo, you have to watch the three ads each day.
1810890	1814311	And for the 339 version, you don't get ads.
1815812	1817373	Is that a... That's the truth?
1817633	1819854	That's a real truth about the system?
1820314	1821355	One of the reviews said that.
1823276	1829479	If that is for real, then this... Yeah, I'm lost for words.
1830171	1839098	It seemed like an interesting idea at E3 and has quickly become... If that is true, I may proclaim this thing the worst gaming system of the past several years.
1840239	1840619	I don't know.
1841600	1844342	There's another system out there that really does want that title.
1844362	1845102	What's that?
1845122	1845803	The Phantom?
1845843	1846603	The N-Gage.
1847084	1848705	Oh, shit, yeah.
1849366	1850066	That's a tough call.
1850446	1855110	I'm afraid to say even with the 40 second load... The N-Gage won't freaking show you ads when you shut it down, though.
1857964	1858364	It's funny, though.
1858384	1861445	They said that one way you could bypass those is pull out the batteries, but, you know.
1861625	1864245	That's so stupid.
1865546	1867826	Why did you pay $339 for the system anyways?
1868546	1875748	I could have this really crappy handheld system, or, I don't know, I could get a 360, get a PSP, get any other system out there on the market.
1877269	1878349	Nice knowing you, Gizmondo.
1878529	1879049	Nice knowing you.
1879889	1881610	Follow-up to something we were talking about last week.
1881650	1883330	Children of Mana on the DS.
1884038	1885220	Of course, Famitsu Magazine.
1885341	1888047	Once again, spilling the beans on what's going on with Children of Mana.
1889049	1891013	It's, you know, going to be a very...
1892472	1893553	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1916991	1921793	And depending on the character that you're doing, you will be able to do different actions with your weapon.
1922133	1928135	So if you play as Frick, you can block incoming attacks with a guard and you can cut grass and stuff.
1929095	1936277	And then Pop, the character, has a flail, but it has a really large attack range and can do a boomerang thing and get long distance items.
1936701	1941483	And then there's another character, Tumble, and you can stun enemies from a long range with arrows.
1941863	1945365	And there's also going to be a fever gauge that will build up as you attack enemies.
1945725	1948767	When it's full, you do a super attack that's unique for each weapon.
1949127	1954869	Why they're calling it a fever gauge and not a limit break, which it just sounds the same damn thing as, I'm not sure.
1956350	1956790	Whatever.
1957070	1957471	That's cool.
1958111	1959051	Sounds like it'll be pretty cool.
1959071	1960032	I'll definitely want to check that out.
1961993	1964854	And you know we love to talk about video games that are being made into movies.
1965720	1967460	Oh yeah, usually most of them.
1967840	1968961	Did you go see Doom this weekend?
1969421	1969721	Not yet.
1970241	1972701	I have plans to go see it no matter how bad it is.
1973001	1974522	I will not probably see this.
1974582	1976802	I like Doom.
1976862	1977682	I respect Doom.
1977742	1978422	It's a series.
1978482	1979022	I like Doom 3.
1979242	1979942	I thought it was cool.
1979962	1980643	It's a popcorn movie.
1980663	1981283	Didn't need the movie.
1981523	1982203	Didn't need the movie.
1982743	1983863	It's a popcorn movie.
1984003	1985823	It's a poisoned popcorn movie.
1986664	1990184	People are looking for some great acting stuff.
1990464	1994325	You're not going to find it in video game movies until some other actual...
1995046	1996267	Well-directed ones come out.
1996327	2002950	I understand that, but even like... I don't know, even like Mortal Kombat had a halfway decent story, I suppose.
2002970	2009573	I just don't... I really don't... And Christopher Lambert was... I really don't understand how you can't make a good video game movie.
2009893	2010694	It's not that different.
2010714	2016116	You're just... Instead of taking the source materials from a book, a play, or something like that, you're taking it from a game.
2016516	2017037	Big deal.
2017157	2017397	I mean...
2018148	2018668	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2044417	2046819	Well, it's just, they didn't go like all pixelated.
2046839	2048220	They didn't stomp on Goombas and stuff.
2048260	2048821	Exactly.
2049241	2050602	It's not retarded like that.
2051243	2053205	But, of course, you know, Super Mario Bros.
2053225	2059931	the movie came out when they were making these really strange sci-fi movies, you know, like Waterworld and, you know, Judge Dredd and stuff.
2060211	2060411	Right.
2060431	2062533	That was a whole other trend, but whatever.
2063273	2064835	I still have high hopes for Silent Hill.
2065235	2069519	You know, there's like one little publicity photo out right now, which tells you nothing about the movie, but...
2070374	2070775	House of the Dead
2096718	2097078	Dungeon Siege
2121360	2122000	by Microsoft.
2135714	2137055	I'm a fan of Swordfish, though.
2163766	2167708	That movie basically said, I'm going to kick your ass in the very beginning of the movie, and it did that.
2167888	2168389	It was awesome.
2169309	2170530	I saw like half of it.
2171611	2172551	It was a great movie.
2172571	2174292	I fell asleep.
2174412	2178194	The whole movie was just the villain winning, and that was the best part of the whole movie.
2179595	2180035	Alright.
2180175	2181336	No more stories from you, Loki?
2181576	2183197	Well, I got a couple things about the PSP.
2183357	2184178	Sure, what's up?
2185439	2187280	The first being that there's a game coming out.
2187480	2189821	It's supposed to be released, I believe, in December.
2190081	2190842	DJ Maxx.
2191042	2191342	It's a
2192148	2192649	Beep Mania
2207617	2208998	Out on the website now.
2209478	2212400	They're also on PSP Updates, which is pretty cool.
2212640	2216903	The other thing for music gaming fans is this game called Button Mashing Revolution.
2218564	2219965	That's when you play DDR on a controller.
2220065	2221987	Yeah, DDR on a controller.
2222307	2223047	They have it for PSP.
2223067	2227670	You can go download it on PSPUpdates.com as well.
2228171	2230592	Another interesting thing I saw is they have a Pac-Man race.
2230612	2231993	Wait, wait, does it have Butterfly?
2232614	2233014	I don't know.
2234830	2236952	Pac-Man World Rally Crash Bandicoot Racing
2251201	2252482	Thank you for watching!
2267836	2269418	My Faith in the Crash Bandicoot series went out the door.
2269438	2270619	You want to hear what they did for this one?
2270659	2272761	They made it a platform game and a racing game.
2272801	2274563	So you can get out of your car and do platform stuff.
2274583	2276164	I'm like, but it's a racing game.
2276444	2281549	Wouldn't you lose the race if you got out of your car to lay spikes down maybe or something?
2281569	2282530	I forget.
2282590	2282931	It's dumb.
2282951	2283531	Alright, sorry.
2283571	2284152	Batman World.
2284432	2293434	Pac-Man World Race, uh, World Rally, um... Wait, wait, wait, I said... Wait, this is weird, because isn't there that Mario Kart arcade game coming out?
2293554	2293694	Yeah.
2293714	2296415	And aren't there supposed to be Namco characters in that game?
2296555	2296995	Yeah, there are.
2297015	2300076	Because Namco's a part of that whole Triforce thing that did the F-Zero game?
2300156	2300616	Uh, there is.
2300876	2302817	So that's weird, because...
2304326	2306649	If this is coming out to compete with Mario Kart...
2319607	2322349	The other thing that they ported was Quake 2 this week.
2322509	2324690	They've done a new port of that, and that's pretty awesome.
2324950	2327531	But I'm not a huge Quake fan, so... I'm going to check it out.
2327551	2327971	I like Quake.
2328152	2329792	But Quake 2, I mean... I like the first Quake, though.
2329812	2331413	I'm still a purist with the first Quake.
2331873	2337436	Yeah, well, they have Quake 2, or Quake 1 available right now, and that's pretty awesome.
2337636	2339617	And, you know, Quake 2 is just going to be even more awesome.
2341558	2342459	Not necessarily.
2342699	2343639	I kind of skipped over Quake 2.
2343779	2346681	I played a lot of Quake 1, played a lot of Quake 3, didn't play a lot of Quake 2.
2346721	2347942	I don't know.
2348122	2348842	I'm just weird like that.
2350321	2351582	Last story of the night, guys.
2351982	2362926	Hideo Kojima has a blog out there, and it's been out there for a little while on the Kojima Productions website, but now it's in English, so you can kind of check out some of the things he talks about in his blog.
2362946	2365027	What's kind of interesting, he doesn't just talk about games.
2365067	2371669	I mean, he talked about directing Metal Gear Solid 4, and he's talked about some personal things, but he talks about kind of random things as well.
2371689	2375131	I thought this was an interesting quote, what he said about Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, the movie.
2376631	2377031	Interesting quote.
2377051	2377171	Yeah.
2377191	2378152	I know I aspire to be Veruca Salt.
2378212	2379113	I don't know about you, but...
2407133	2407453	Forget it.
2408374	2408674	Alright.
2409435	2411196	Finally, the last thing I've got.
2412017	2412757	SQ Stare.
2413598	2414278	You might remember him.
2414339	2419182	He's the guy that's working on hacking the Wi-Fi in the DS.
2419442	2423145	He's closing in on the bounty, which stands right now at $2,694.15.
2423185	2424987	But he's pretty much almost 100% done with everything.
2425007	2427589	Just a few more things to work on, but
2435199	2438301	Pretty soon they're going to be hacking that, and God knows what that's going to bring.
2438981	2443184	But I hear some pretty cool things are going to be coming out for the DS and the Revolution.
2443244	2444844	I know they're talking about a new Mario Paint.
2446185	2446705	Cool.
2446786	2448587	Oh, like a Mario Paint with a Revolution would be cool.
2448647	2452849	Mario Paint Revolution, and imagine Wi-Fi with the DS.
2453269	2454890	Be able to post your pictures.
2454910	2455771	PictoChat on HD.
2455791	2457191	PictoChat online, yeah.
2457231	2457852	That's beautiful.
2458292	2459953	So we'll have to look forward to that.
2460033	2460733	Okay, sounds good.
2461394	2462494	All right, final thoughts.
2462514	2463115	Your final thought.
2464546	2469089	I'm going to have to try maybe picking up Metroid Pinball this week because I want to see about that Rumble Pack thing.
2469569	2470410	That might be interesting.
2470450	2471551	Oh man, too many games to buy.
2471591	2473512	My final thought is there's too many games to buy.
2473552	2475454	We're getting in that month now where I'm going to be broke.
2475574	2477395	Oh wait, the Christmas season now.
2477455	2477835	I'm going to die.
2477855	2478376	Wait until November.
2478396	2479977	November is like 50 billion games.
2479997	2480477	I'm going to die.
2480557	2482279	It's going to be a fun month for us though with this show.
2483331	2484391	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2508021	2508842	Rush to Rock, Rush 2049
2537859	2554409	Prapa the Rappa and DDR and in DDR there's been a musician in several of the Dance Dance Revolution games who anybody who's really into the Dance Dance Revolution games knows and really respects and that's Captain Jack Captain Jack passed away this week at the age of 43 of a stroke
2555630	2555910	and DarkSakura.
2570077	2573261	It was not going to be critically acclaimed.
2573782	2578207	It was just about fun and getting stuck in your head with those little march songs.
2578807	2580209	And, you know, that's what DDR is all about.
2580229	2587518	Because a lot of people, when they get into DDR, they go play it and then they run home and they burn a CD of all the DDR songs and listen to it in their car and show all their friends and stuff.
2587938	2589320	And Captain Jack's just a part of that.
2589810	2611456	and the dance game community and really the music community as a whole lost somebody really awesome this week so we wanted to dedicate tonight's episode to Captain Jack and although we don't normally play music on the podcast we felt tonight it would be appropriate to play a little clip of you guys of Captain Jack with Together and Forever so we're going to close out with this tonight have a great week and we'll see you next week
2666445	2670053	That's the end of another Orange Lounge Radio To Go edition.
2670334	2675866	This podcast is a proud part of www.orangeloungeradio.com.
2676327	2677329	See you next update.
