00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
Hello, everybody.

00:20.000 --> 00:26.000
Once again, welcome aboard for the Orange Lounge Radio-to-Go edition.

00:56.000 --> 00:59.760
independent radio rocks. Joining me as always my name is Rob Roberts

00:59.760 --> 01:03.640
but her name is DarkSakura.

01:03.640 --> 01:07.480
Yeah, that would be me. That is you. That would be me

01:07.480 --> 01:10.760
if I were me today. Who are you today then?

01:10.760 --> 01:14.240
My name is Zool.

01:14.240 --> 01:17.560
Are you the keymaster? Oh god.

01:17.560 --> 01:21.400
Alright, that was bad. Alright. That was the ferret.

01:21.400 --> 01:24.800
Also with us, Techmaster Loki. I am here and I'm me.

01:24.800 --> 01:30.520
So yeah, you're not I don't believe you. You're not the gatekeeper or whatever. No, okay

01:30.520 --> 01:33.200
That's good. Cuz then you guys would have to have sex or something. They'll be nasty

01:33.920 --> 01:35.920
I'm married. Thank you. I know you are

01:36.760 --> 01:38.360
anyway

01:38.360 --> 01:40.440
We're here to talk about games, right? So let's do it

01:40.440 --> 01:45.280
let's get into how is your gaming week and then we'll get into the news and what's going on around the

01:45.720 --> 01:50.280
Gaming world the hack and crack. I think we have a mod story tonight UK news everything

01:50.280 --> 01:54.120
Let's start off, though, with our gaming week, because, you know, part of this show is about

01:54.120 --> 01:55.120
us, right?

01:55.120 --> 01:56.120
So, Dark Sakura.

01:56.120 --> 01:57.120
It's all about me, you know.

01:57.120 --> 01:58.120
Yeah, I know.

01:58.120 --> 01:59.660
I'm the diva of the show.

01:59.660 --> 02:01.480
How was your gaming week, Dark Sakura?

02:01.480 --> 02:05.240
Actually, I was so busy all week, I haven't had much of a chance to play things, although

02:05.240 --> 02:06.920
I have put in effort.

02:06.920 --> 02:10.560
I got a Dalmatian on that dog game.

02:10.560 --> 02:11.560
Nintendogs?

02:11.560 --> 02:12.560
Yeah.

02:12.560 --> 02:13.560
How quickly do we forget?

02:13.560 --> 02:17.860
After forgetting to feed my dogs for, like, two days, I have a new dog that lives with

02:17.860 --> 02:22.740
my corgi ein and my shiba inu menshi.

02:22.740 --> 02:25.940
It's a dalmatian because my friend loaned me a hat so I could get a dalmatian in my

02:25.940 --> 02:27.940
kennel and give the hat back.

02:27.940 --> 02:30.620
My dog's name is Ikea.

02:30.620 --> 02:31.620
We were going to name it Alpo.

02:31.620 --> 02:33.220
Yes, I suggested Alpo.

02:33.220 --> 02:39.900
Alpo didn't work and I didn't want to pick something as crude as naming my dog Smallpox,

02:39.900 --> 02:45.460
so I named it Ikea because it made me think of meatballs.

02:45.460 --> 02:51.620
also got me that lawyer game. Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney. Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney.

02:51.620 --> 02:55.380
I think it's ironic that there's like a lawyer game and a doctor game out like right around

02:55.380 --> 02:59.160
the same time. Doctor game's getting a secret too. Trauma Center. Oh my gosh. I've heard

02:59.160 --> 03:02.020
Trauma Center is really difficult. I haven't gotten a chance to play it, but I hear Trauma

03:02.020 --> 03:06.040
Center is really, really difficult. You know, unfortunately that brings me back to the game

03:06.040 --> 03:10.380
of Life and Death. Remember that game back on the PC way a long time ago? I think about

03:10.380 --> 03:14.900
operation but sorry dark soccer wouldn't operation just be an operation the MMO

03:14.900 --> 03:21.380
no you know too many doctors ruin the operation um but yeah I was gonna play

03:21.380 --> 03:25.160
it and then Dan started to play it used to play the Castlevania that but so he

03:25.160 --> 03:30.020
needs to let me play the attorney game I need to solve cases I'm good at that

03:30.020 --> 03:34.940
kind of thing um I also tried to play some Katamari but that's too busy and

03:34.940 --> 03:38.860
then I screamed obscenities at illustrator this morning good good times

03:38.860 --> 03:42.340
Maybe you could check out an Illustrator podcast to help you out there.

03:42.340 --> 03:45.020
I'm sure there's got to be one out there somewhere.

03:45.020 --> 03:47.020
We hate Adobe Hour!

03:47.020 --> 03:49.980
Alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?

03:49.980 --> 03:55.100
Actually, I have to say, because we're not talking about it immediately, we did have

03:55.100 --> 04:00.060
a very cool gaming event on Thursday that we'll go into later.

04:00.060 --> 04:02.420
Yes, we will get into this later, definitely.

04:02.420 --> 04:05.960
And also, speaking of events, the Sacramento Independent Audio for Katrina Relief, thank

04:05.960 --> 04:09.960
Thank you to everybody that helped out with that, sending your donations in online.

04:09.960 --> 04:13.320
We had the garage sale the other night, and we're doing a lot of good for a lot of people.

04:13.320 --> 04:16.160
I have a trunk full of stuff to donate to the Salvation Army now, too.

04:16.160 --> 04:17.160
The leftovers.

04:17.160 --> 04:19.760
Including some games, some DS games and stuff were in there, right?

04:19.760 --> 04:25.220
I actually, with the games, I can get more out of them by selling them to places that

04:25.220 --> 04:31.880
give cash for games, and then turn over the proceeds with our donations.

04:31.880 --> 04:36.720
I actually donated my own copies of Polaris and Field Magic, which I'm done with both

04:36.720 --> 04:37.720
of those games very much.

04:37.720 --> 04:41.480
Yeah, because I remember how much you love Polaris and Polaris.

04:41.480 --> 04:42.480
You know what?

04:42.480 --> 04:43.980
There's worse DS games out there, though.

04:43.980 --> 04:47.600
Check out my review of Sprung last week, if you want to hear a bad DS game.

04:47.600 --> 04:48.600
I still need Electroplankton.

04:48.600 --> 04:49.600
That's what I'm waiting for.

04:49.600 --> 04:50.600
I want to check that out, too.

04:50.600 --> 04:52.600
Loki, how was your game of the week?

04:52.600 --> 04:53.880
I didn't play too much.

04:53.880 --> 05:00.640
I did get to play a new game for the PSP, which is just some Hudson pinball game, where

05:00.640 --> 05:06.640
Where you actually play it sideways, just like Star Soldier, didn't like it.

05:06.640 --> 05:09.300
It was just pinball and I got bored with it really quick.

05:09.300 --> 05:12.880
There's better games to be playing on the PSP than pinball.

05:12.880 --> 05:19.240
And you know, with only two boards unlocked at the beginning, it was just pretty lame.

05:19.240 --> 05:22.540
Not a good thing to be playing on the PSP.

05:22.540 --> 05:27.040
The other game I played of course was More Wheel of Katamari, and that's still fun.

05:27.040 --> 05:29.380
It doesn't get boring at all.

05:29.380 --> 05:33.420
the game I haven't been playing is in 10 Dogs because I'm tired of that game now

05:33.420 --> 05:37.980
and I'm not feeding my dog so the hell with the dog. My dog floated to the top of the bowl.

05:37.980 --> 05:41.540
You need to bring Taco over so I can play with Taco

05:41.540 --> 05:44.620
before he runs away. Alright.

05:44.620 --> 05:48.220
That's it? That's, well, Burnout.

05:48.220 --> 05:51.940
Burnout Revenge. I've been playing that but

05:51.940 --> 05:56.300
I'm going to check out some different games this week. I've got XSX on tour

05:56.300 --> 06:00.460
so I'm anticipating Warriors which is coming out this week

06:00.460 --> 06:04.260
so I'll definitely be reviewing that. My gaming week

06:04.260 --> 06:08.700
I've been playing Castlevania DS still I know I talked about last week but I love it

06:08.700 --> 06:12.060
I love it it's a great game so I've been playing a lot more of that and honestly not a

06:12.060 --> 06:13.140
whole lot of new stuff

06:13.140 --> 06:16.560
until today the day we're recording this show

06:16.560 --> 06:21.980
I finally caved and I bought World of Warcraft so I could join the 1.5

06:21.980 --> 06:26.160
gazillion other people, isn't the official number 1.5 gazillion people

06:26.160 --> 06:27.900
playing World of Warcraft, I think.

06:27.900 --> 06:28.900
Indeed it is.

06:28.900 --> 06:32.600
Yes, because you can tell because there's 1.5 gazillion servers and all of my friends

06:32.600 --> 06:34.200
are on different ones.

06:34.200 --> 06:37.440
So no matter which server I play on, I'm going to piss somebody off.

06:37.440 --> 06:41.600
So I think I finally narrowed it down to a couple, and I know Dark Sakura and I will

06:41.600 --> 06:44.120
both be playing on one of those servers together, so it'll be cool.

06:44.120 --> 06:45.360
It will be on Scarlet Crusade.

06:45.360 --> 06:46.360
Yes.

06:46.360 --> 06:47.360
And we're both playing Alliance.

06:47.360 --> 06:48.360
Please don't cyberstalk us.

06:48.360 --> 06:49.360
Yes.

06:49.360 --> 06:51.280
But I'm not saying who our characters are or what.

06:51.280 --> 06:53.840
Because they won't be named after ourselves.

06:53.840 --> 06:56.000
But if you want to cyberstalk us, send us an email, you never know.

06:56.000 --> 07:00.400
I was, somebody sent me an email that says, hey I want to add you to Xbox Live and I said

07:00.400 --> 07:01.400
okay, why not?

07:01.400 --> 07:02.400
And then they kicked my ass in Halo.

07:02.400 --> 07:06.960
I'm wondering if they're doing new gamer tags for Xbox Live for the 360.

07:06.960 --> 07:11.880
I'm curious about that too, because I want to try and get Sky, just Sky, but...

07:11.880 --> 07:12.880
Same.

07:12.880 --> 07:16.800
I don't think I'll be able to do it, but I will be willing to, you know, get on Xbox

07:16.800 --> 07:18.680
Live right when I get the game, so...

07:18.680 --> 07:22.920
Because I don't have just plain old Sky on regular Xbox right now.

07:22.920 --> 07:23.920
I have something else.

07:23.920 --> 07:30.920
I really haven't played enough of it yet, I mean I'm level 3, I'm playing a gnome character.

07:31.920 --> 07:32.920
David the gnome?

07:33.920 --> 07:40.920
No, I was thinking of the Strangers with Candy reference. We're gonna go kill the gnomes. I don't even remember the line, but I just remember it was really funny.

07:41.920 --> 07:42.920
I'm playing a night elf.

07:43.920 --> 07:46.920
Total inside joke, sorry guys. But I'm playing a warlock, but I'm more like level 3 right now.

07:46.920 --> 07:49.760
but more like level three right now but I thought it's pretty badass because I

07:49.760 --> 07:51.680
actually got a spell where you can set something on fire

07:51.680 --> 07:55.400
and that was cool, like actually setting it on fire. I have not left Final Fantasy 11

07:55.400 --> 07:58.880
I'm just gonna try and balance the two games, I'm gonna balance the two games for a little while

07:58.880 --> 08:01.880
there's things about Final Fantasy 11 that were really starting to get to me

08:01.880 --> 08:05.200
so I want to play World of Warcraft, see what, no

08:05.200 --> 08:07.800
there's things I like about Final Fantasy 11, there's things I dislike about Final Fantasy 11

08:07.800 --> 08:11.380
I really need to sit down and dedicate time to play the game

08:11.380 --> 08:15.280
I haven't played in months and I really, I don't want to give it up

08:15.280 --> 08:18.800
I still want to play the game, but I need to dedicate a day or something

08:18.800 --> 08:22.680
in which the fiance will not interfere with the game

08:22.680 --> 08:25.960
and I get to play. I need to give WoW a fair shot because honestly

08:25.960 --> 08:29.760
I owe it to our listeners to give an unbiased

08:29.760 --> 08:34.400
perspective of what's going on in WoW. Let's give away some crap. You should send me a letter.

08:34.400 --> 08:38.880
We'll see. Let's give away some crap. Last week we promised we would give away some

08:38.880 --> 08:39.400
crap.

08:39.400 --> 08:43.880
We're gonna give away a copy of Death Junior and pull a number out of the hat

09:13.880 --> 09:27.880
see dig dig dig dig dig dig 12 number 12 is gonna be this one it's Jason and

09:27.880 --> 09:31.960
there's no last name but I think it's cute because the username it's coming

09:31.960 --> 09:36.160
from a gmail address and this is not the same as the username but it's a otaku

09:36.160 --> 09:40.900
land is how their name comes out otaku land is one of our also regular writers

10:10.900 --> 10:16.540
pz.com, that has people who deal in import games, trading import games, and someone on

10:16.540 --> 10:18.540
there has panorama cotton.

10:18.540 --> 10:25.180
They want $500 freaking dollars for it, and I said, uh, no, but they do trade in the rare.

10:25.180 --> 10:27.540
That would be a great Christmas present.

10:27.540 --> 10:34.260
If some dear listener wants to spend $500 on little old me, I ain't stopping you.

10:34.260 --> 10:35.740
You're a sucker, for one.

10:35.740 --> 10:36.740
I ain't stopping you.

10:36.740 --> 10:38.620
All right, well, congratulations to our two winners there.

10:38.620 --> 10:41.380
I'm glad some people that are involved in the show could win those.

10:41.380 --> 10:42.380
So good job, guys!

10:42.380 --> 10:43.860
We will do another giveaway very soon.

10:43.860 --> 10:45.080
Tune in next week.

10:45.080 --> 10:46.080
Maybe we'll have something next week.

10:46.080 --> 10:47.460
Loki, do we have anything in the prize vault for next week?

10:47.460 --> 10:48.460
Do we know?

10:48.460 --> 10:53.280
I've got an assortment of anime soundtracks, like a ton of them.

10:53.280 --> 10:54.280
So possibly.

10:54.280 --> 10:56.460
Okay, well we'll just have to give a whole lot of those away.

10:56.460 --> 11:00.060
So alright, we'll see what happens.

11:00.060 --> 11:03.860
Let's get into some actual gaming news tonight.

11:03.860 --> 11:07.460
I'm gonna let Dark Sakura start it off because Dark Sakura has an interesting little follow-up

11:07.460 --> 11:11.980
to the state law here in California, which everyone's been screaming about.

11:11.980 --> 11:14.700
Somebody's taken action against this law, aren't they, DarkSakura?

11:14.700 --> 11:19.460
Yes, and basically it's a lot of the stuff that we've brought out about, you know, first

11:19.460 --> 11:29.380
of all, the MPAA being a private entity, you know, basically raiding the movies now, but

11:29.380 --> 11:35.980
we have the government controlling what video games can be sold, you know, where's the equality

11:35.980 --> 11:36.980
in that.

11:36.980 --> 11:39.860
Basically, the Entertainment Software Association

11:39.860 --> 11:41.740
is planning to sue the state of California

11:41.740 --> 11:45.220
over the passage of AB 1179, the bill that

11:45.220 --> 11:47.260
outlawed the sale of violent video games to minors.

11:50.020 --> 11:53.020
They're very confident that they're going to win.

11:53.020 --> 11:56.580
They've got the arguments very well.

11:56.580 --> 11:58.500
They basically, from what I understand,

11:58.500 --> 12:01.960
have taken the law and broken the new bill that's passed

12:01.960 --> 12:06.020
and broken it down item by item, and also

12:06.020 --> 12:12.040
Comparing it to what the current laws are, actually there's one in particular that is

12:12.040 --> 12:15.140
actually the first one used.

12:15.140 --> 12:23.700
Actually the person who wrote this article did a comparison by showing the law about

12:23.700 --> 12:29.420
the sale of alcohol to minors compared with the law regarding the game sale.

12:29.420 --> 12:34.460
And the game sale one reads as this, except as otherwise provided in subdivision C. Every

13:04.460 --> 13:08.900
Violent video game means a video game in which the range of options available to a player

13:08.900 --> 13:13.500
includes killing, maiming, dismembering, or sexually assaulting the image of a human being

13:13.500 --> 13:17.420
if those acts are depicted in the game in a manner that does either or it goes into

13:17.420 --> 13:27.940
the whole outline of it.

13:27.940 --> 13:35.220
A lot of what it's going into, as far as trying to define, is that it's going on the assumption

13:35.220 --> 13:39.700
that it's depicting a violent act on a person.

13:39.700 --> 13:43.540
Thing is, is that they're not people.

13:43.540 --> 13:45.380
They're video game images.

13:45.380 --> 13:48.100
Without rehashing this whole same argument over and over again, though, because it seems

13:48.100 --> 13:51.460
like we've had something about violent video games like every week on this program for

13:51.460 --> 13:52.460
the last three months.

13:52.460 --> 13:53.980
The point is, it's not a clear law.

13:53.980 --> 13:56.060
That's what I'm saying.

13:56.060 --> 13:57.060
Who makes that definition?

13:57.060 --> 13:58.060
What is violent?

13:58.060 --> 14:01.100
Who makes that definition and who's checking on them because we got a system of checks

14:01.100 --> 14:02.440
and balances in this country.

14:02.440 --> 14:04.720
Who's checking on the people that are making these calls?

14:04.720 --> 14:05.720
That's what I want to know.

14:05.720 --> 14:10.820
The whole point it makes here is how clear the sale of alcohol law is in comparison to

14:10.820 --> 14:17.900
this piece of crap video game law because item by item, it goes into lots of definition

14:17.900 --> 14:23.900
as to what these items are but the thing is that it's not clear.

14:23.900 --> 14:30.620
How can something suffer when the same something does not exist?

14:30.620 --> 14:35.780
I don't necessarily disagree with trying to control the sale of games, just like you would

14:35.780 --> 14:43.140
say that an under 17 person shouldn't buy an R-rated DVD, but my whole thing is that

14:43.140 --> 14:49.540
the bill is so vague that it seems like it's just prepared to be there to target things

14:49.540 --> 14:52.540
when they come out like Grand Theft Auto.

14:52.540 --> 14:57.280
It's built so that when somebody kills somebody and blames Grand Theft Auto, that's when people

14:57.280 --> 14:59.260
are going to panic and say, who sold them the game?

14:59.260 --> 15:00.260
Find them.

15:00.260 --> 15:01.260
Invoke the law.

15:01.260 --> 15:04.220
But my question is, no, no, before that all happens, who is making the determination what

15:04.220 --> 15:05.220
is a value?

15:05.220 --> 15:06.220
That's my biggest problem with the law.

15:06.220 --> 15:09.700
Otherwise, you know, whatever, I suppose they have to do what they have to do, and I'm okay

15:09.700 --> 15:11.340
with them, you know.

15:11.340 --> 15:16.300
I was all for ratings, because ratings puts the power in the hands of those who should

15:16.300 --> 15:17.440
possess it, the parents.

15:17.440 --> 15:20.060
Why not have the bill just adopt the ratings that are in place right now?

15:20.060 --> 15:21.060
You know what this is?

15:21.060 --> 15:25.060
Basically, legalizing censorship as far as...

15:25.060 --> 15:27.060
In a way, in a way.

15:27.060 --> 15:29.060
It's limiting free expression.

15:29.060 --> 15:33.060
It's not stopping the games from being made, no, but...

15:33.060 --> 15:35.060
But it's putting the scarlet letter on them?

15:35.060 --> 15:39.060
Yeah, that's exactly it. That's a great comparison right there.

15:39.060 --> 15:43.060
But let's face it, in some of our demographic, I know for me,

15:43.060 --> 15:47.060
the games that have the scarlet letter on them, or should I say the scarlet number,

15:47.060 --> 15:51.660
I'm going to be more attracted to and go, ooh, do I get to see some titties in this

15:51.660 --> 15:52.660
one?

15:52.660 --> 15:53.660
Exactly.

15:53.660 --> 15:54.660
I want more titties in my games.

15:54.660 --> 15:57.340
No, they're going to be preventing kids from buying them.

15:57.340 --> 16:02.420
That means Rockstar, the gloves are off, do whatever the fuck you want, just release the

16:02.420 --> 16:03.420
games.

16:03.420 --> 16:05.700
Anyway, all right.

16:05.700 --> 16:14.100
I think, I look at this as the government basically trying to take the power from the

16:14.100 --> 16:18.360
people trying to take the responsibility out of the people's hands.

16:18.360 --> 16:26.360
I think that, well, I do admit the game companies do have a duty of responsibility to the consumer

16:26.360 --> 16:29.400
to make sure that the product that they put on the market is exactly what they say they're

16:29.400 --> 16:30.400
selling.

16:30.400 --> 16:31.400
Exactly.

16:31.400 --> 16:36.360
And to rate the game appropriately and market the game towards the appropriate audience.

16:36.360 --> 16:41.080
To compare, when I was studying business law, they brought up a case about a woman who was

16:41.080 --> 16:48.220
suing over having pieces of clam shell in her clam chowder, and she broke a tooth, so

16:48.220 --> 16:50.020
she sued.

16:50.020 --> 16:58.380
The thing is that there is an expectation that there may be clam shell in the game.

16:58.380 --> 17:00.980
She lost, not in the game, but in the soup.

17:00.980 --> 17:03.540
Warning, this game may contain clam parts.

17:03.540 --> 17:10.640
But she lost the case, because under the rights and responsibility for safe food handling,

17:10.640 --> 17:16.460
having bits and pieces in that, chicken soup, you know, or you may have a fish bone in your

17:16.460 --> 17:17.460
fish fillet.

17:17.460 --> 17:27.380
Now, to compare, when you buy a game that is rated M, you should expect that there's

17:27.380 --> 17:30.120
going to be mature themes in the game.

17:30.120 --> 17:38.560
You may see some boobies, you may hear the F word, regardless, you have been warned by

17:38.560 --> 17:42.920
By that little end, being on the bottom of the game, you have been warned.

17:42.920 --> 17:46.280
Now, I do think that Rockstar was lax.

17:46.280 --> 17:51.120
I mean, and even so, I can't really fault this either.

17:51.120 --> 17:56.160
You know, removing the code, bracketing it out, that's done all the time.

17:56.160 --> 17:57.920
Aren't we feeling a little blue in the face here?

17:57.920 --> 17:58.920
I am.

17:58.920 --> 17:59.920
All right.

17:59.920 --> 18:04.000
But, you know, honestly, there is and is not fault in that.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.200
Technically, they did remove access to it.

18:06.200 --> 18:09.440
It just happened to be somebody out there who's curious enough to find it.

18:09.440 --> 18:10.440
No easy answer.

18:10.440 --> 18:11.440
All right.

18:11.440 --> 18:12.440
We welcome your feedback, as always.

18:12.440 --> 18:13.440
ToGo at orangelaunchradio.com.

18:13.440 --> 18:14.440
I'm tired of talking about this subject.

18:14.440 --> 18:15.440
All right.

18:15.440 --> 18:16.440
Then let's get to a new one.

18:16.440 --> 18:18.840
Let's talk about, ooh, Digital Life happened this weekend, which was that big expo in New

18:18.840 --> 18:22.580
York, which I really wanted to go to, but I couldn't, but I heard it was very crowded.

18:22.580 --> 18:26.360
We had some folks call in on our live show Sunday nights that were at Digital Life saying

18:26.360 --> 18:30.680
that just crowded amongst crowded, just really, really crowded stuff.

18:30.680 --> 18:33.480
A few folks got to check out some new games, though.

18:33.480 --> 18:37.800
One thing that did happen was that the Xbox Live Arcade lineup was announced.

18:37.800 --> 18:41.160
Now Loki, I know you talked about this a little bit last week because you had some photos

18:41.160 --> 18:44.640
of some of the games in development, but they did kind of officially say what's going to

18:44.640 --> 18:45.640
be in it.

18:45.640 --> 18:48.360
What I think is interesting, a whole lot of PopCap games showing up.

18:48.360 --> 18:52.380
Astro Pop, Bejeweled 2, Zuma going to be in there.

18:52.380 --> 18:57.160
Some other games in there as well, Gauntlet, Joust, and then of course the Marble Blaster

18:57.160 --> 19:01.200
talking about Robotron and Smash TV, which is kind of interesting to me that they would

19:01.200 --> 19:04.760
to put these in the arcade when you can just buy the Midway Arcade Treasures collection,

19:04.760 --> 19:06.960
which would be a much better deal, I think, for some of those games.

19:06.960 --> 19:08.240
Remember, don't shoot the food.

19:08.240 --> 19:12.600
Yeah, I know. That's not the complete list, but those are the only games that sound very

19:12.600 --> 19:20.020
familiar to me. So check that out if you're curious on your Xbox 360 when you get that.

19:20.020 --> 19:25.880
Also on the Xbox 360, this is interesting, they're doing this in Japan. They're going

19:25.880 --> 19:30.880
to be doing a beta test of Final Fantasy XI on the brand new Xbox 360. The console launches

19:30.880 --> 19:38.120
in Japan on December 10th, and if you purchase the limited edition Xbox 360 package, you're

19:38.120 --> 19:44.620
going to get a free Final Fantasy XI beta test disk while supplies last. Interesting.

19:44.620 --> 19:45.620
Japan only though.

19:45.620 --> 19:46.620
Of course.

19:46.620 --> 19:47.620
Sorry guys.

19:47.620 --> 19:48.620
We're going to start looking for them on Yahoo!

19:48.620 --> 19:49.620
Actions Japan.

19:49.620 --> 19:55.480
Even though we're getting the system first, they get to beta test Final Fantasy XI. Isn't

19:55.480 --> 19:56.480
that lovely?

19:56.480 --> 20:03.960
Alright, now DarkSakura, you have a story about the 360 as well and some kind of bad

20:03.960 --> 20:06.080
news about the dev kits.

20:06.080 --> 20:13.960
Yeah, we did cover about the theft of the 360 dev kit.

20:13.960 --> 20:17.560
I think so, but if we didn't, I'm sure people read about it or heard about it on another

20:17.560 --> 20:18.560
cast or something.

20:18.560 --> 20:20.560
But yeah, some dev kits were stolen.

20:20.560 --> 20:27.080
At any rate, a Dutch newspaper reported that Microsoft is going to be preparing a $100

20:27.080 --> 20:36.080
million lawsuit against those responsible for the theft, because they're wanting to

20:36.080 --> 20:41.600
protect the security so that you can't hack the Xbox 360, which you know is a big problem

20:41.600 --> 20:45.160
with the Xbox here is that they pretty much broke it right away.

20:45.160 --> 20:50.440
And we started having the name on the Xbox and extra huge hard drives and...

20:50.440 --> 20:51.620
Look, Ui, you're laughing.

20:51.620 --> 20:56.340
I'm laughing because the way they set up the whole hard drive situation anyways is just

20:56.340 --> 20:57.900
asking to be hacked.

20:57.900 --> 21:01.700
Let's include the game on the hard drive that runs on the operating system.

21:01.700 --> 21:06.220
No, no one's gonna take that off the hard drive and figure out how it works.

21:06.220 --> 21:07.220
No, not at all.

21:07.220 --> 21:09.740
That'll never happen.

21:09.740 --> 21:14.580
They're just like, okay, we're gonna leave this door unlocked, now we're trusting.

21:14.580 --> 21:19.000
You're not going to break in, because if you do, you'll be sorry, you know, so it's like,

21:19.000 --> 21:20.000
come on.

21:20.000 --> 21:25.060
There's also an interesting statement on here, though, from the hacking group who's, I guess,

21:25.060 --> 21:26.060
responsible.

21:26.060 --> 21:30.020
It's from, I hope I'm saying this wrong, it's SmartXX.com.

21:30.020 --> 21:32.800
You hope you're saying that wrong?

21:32.800 --> 21:34.340
He said, I hope I'm saying that wrong.

21:34.340 --> 21:36.140
I said, I hope I'm not saying that wrong.

21:36.140 --> 21:37.140
Oh, my bad.

21:37.140 --> 21:40.140
I threw a ferret at you.

21:40.140 --> 21:41.140
Anyway.

21:41.140 --> 21:47.460
They are saying the pictures of stolen dev kits emerged claiming Microsoft was actually

21:47.460 --> 21:51.620
complicit in the group's acquisition of the kits.

21:51.620 --> 21:59.940
They went on to say, according to the poster, people within Microsoft unaware of the operation

21:59.940 --> 22:04.520
went on to inform the police that they should investigate SmartXX leading to the current

22:04.520 --> 22:10.380
situation and that Microsoft was going to deny it as usual.

22:10.380 --> 22:25.180
Speaking of people getting busted, a game pirate in Richmond, Texas was sentenced to

22:25.180 --> 22:32.420
three years and ten months in a federal prison and a fine of $1.15 million.

22:32.420 --> 22:38.860
Dashieau Ponce de Leon, receiving this sentence there, that 1.15 million dollars representing

22:38.860 --> 22:42.180
the retail value of all the software this guy sold.

22:42.180 --> 22:44.380
Now this guy wasn't doing the thing on BitTorrent or anything.

22:44.380 --> 22:48.620
This guy was actually downloading stuff online then reselling it through the internet.

22:48.620 --> 22:50.340
That's the worst kind of piracy right there.

22:50.340 --> 22:52.700
That's the kind that a lot of people say even if they want to.

22:52.700 --> 22:55.420
That hurts the pockets of the developers.

22:55.420 --> 22:57.700
And just downloading off BitTorrent doesn't?

22:57.700 --> 23:00.100
Well, stop making crappy games.

23:00.100 --> 23:06.100
One person as opposed to one person multiplying the efforts. I buy games look at my collection

23:06.100 --> 23:10.740
I have tons of games that I pay money. I don't think that anyone who my house

23:11.380 --> 23:15.980
Cannot say that I don't buy a lot of games. I just don't want to buy an import system. So

23:16.720 --> 23:22.680
Anyway, so there's that I just thought it was interesting because that kind of made news is like they got one pirate and that made

23:22.680 --> 23:24.180
News, I don't know

23:24.180 --> 23:26.180
Struck me a scar

23:26.180 --> 23:33.180
Alright, let's get into this guy because, my god, this guy gets in the news an awful

23:33.180 --> 23:35.780
lot and we've got like four stories on this guy this week.

23:35.780 --> 23:37.140
Everyone's favorite butthead!

23:37.140 --> 23:41.660
It's Jack Thompson, boys and girls, this is the guy, god, you gotta know who this guy

23:41.660 --> 23:42.660
is right now.

23:42.660 --> 23:44.460
I am so sick of this loser.

23:44.460 --> 23:46.980
He needs to team up with a guy from the 700 Club.

23:46.980 --> 23:50.940
I know, I know, but anyway, this is the guy who, you know, was saying, video games are

23:50.940 --> 23:51.940
evil.

23:51.940 --> 23:57.580
people refute him with backing up everything with solid evidence and then he goes, ìYouíre

23:57.580 --> 23:58.580
just a piss ant.î

23:58.580 --> 24:03.100
Well, I thought this was interesting is that earlier this week you might have heard the

24:03.100 --> 24:08.300
National Institute on Media and the Family, NIMF, the President David Walsh kind of wrote

24:08.300 --> 24:12.980
a letter that kind of distanced himself from Jack Thompson and said, ìI really wish youíd

24:12.980 --> 24:19.140
stop using our name in your arguments and stuff.î A quote from the letter here, ìYour

24:19.140 --> 24:27.200
commentary has included extreme hyperbole and your tactics have included personally

24:27.200 --> 24:30.280
attacking individuals for whom I have a great deal of respect."

24:30.280 --> 24:31.960
I thought that was very interesting.

24:31.960 --> 24:35.040
Get this, Dr. Thompson fought back.

24:35.040 --> 24:37.920
Dr. Thompson fought back.

24:37.920 --> 24:38.920
Is he a doctor?

24:38.920 --> 24:40.920
No, he's not a doctor.

24:40.920 --> 24:47.280
He's a doctor of things he can't say on the air.

24:47.280 --> 24:52.060
fuse two words together there. Anyway, what he did there is that he actually

24:52.060 --> 24:57.280
kind of denied saying, the fact is I have never suggested that Dr. Walsh approves of

24:57.280 --> 25:01.020
what I do. I have countless times told people that I believe he is an expert around the

25:01.020 --> 25:05.080
dangers of video games. The mistake I made apparently naively is thinking that a person

25:05.080 --> 25:09.800
of his expertise would use it actually to help some bereaved families rather than choose

25:09.800 --> 25:13.640
to protect his relationship with portions of the video game industry and its reckless

25:13.640 --> 25:16.420
retail network.

25:16.420 --> 25:20.760
And then he goes on to say, I'm a Christian, and I think Dr. Walsh is as well, and there's

25:20.760 --> 25:26.880
a passage in the New Testament, yada yada yada yada, thou shall not play violent video

25:26.880 --> 25:27.880
games.

25:27.880 --> 25:34.960
I'm really wondering why people keep bringing up Christianity as an illustration of morality.

25:34.960 --> 25:36.840
That's a whole other topic for a whole other cast.

25:36.840 --> 25:41.720
I know, I know, I'm not going to go into it, it's just I find it highly hilarious how he's

25:41.720 --> 25:44.960
defending himself saying, oh but I'm a Christian. Yet he's going around

25:44.960 --> 25:49.080
basically slandering innocent people. You know,

25:49.080 --> 25:52.560
and like I said before, when people are presenting him with evidence that

25:52.560 --> 25:57.080
proves him wrong, he's going back and calling them names.

25:57.080 --> 26:00.720
From what, and I don't want to get into religious debate, but from what I understand about Christianity

26:00.720 --> 26:04.120
there's only one judge. Oh, he's

26:04.120 --> 26:07.680
gonna have to answer to it. There's only one judge. No, it's not Wapner.

26:07.680 --> 26:10.880
Alright. Judge Wapner guy.

26:10.880 --> 26:12.880
No, he's doing the pet court or something.

26:12.880 --> 26:13.880
Oh!

26:13.880 --> 26:14.880
Just Robner's cool.

26:14.880 --> 26:15.880
God, if he did die, that would be really sad.

26:15.880 --> 26:16.880
I don't think he died.

26:16.880 --> 26:17.880
I think he's alive and well.

26:17.880 --> 26:18.880
He's still alive, I think.

26:18.880 --> 26:19.880
He's doing the pet court thing.

26:19.880 --> 26:20.880
I think that man must be indestructible then.

26:20.880 --> 26:21.880
Anyway.

26:21.880 --> 26:25.880
Some other news on Thompson, didn't you have a little side note to that, Dark Sakura?

26:25.880 --> 26:26.880
I thought you did.

26:26.880 --> 26:27.880
Something.

26:27.880 --> 26:28.880
Well, Loki, you had something.

26:28.880 --> 26:35.960
Yeah, that one of the people that he happened to have issues with compared him to Hitler,

26:35.960 --> 26:36.960
which I found hilarious.

26:36.960 --> 26:37.960
Interesting.

26:37.960 --> 26:38.960
I don't know.

26:38.960 --> 26:39.960
I don't find Hitler hilarious.

26:39.960 --> 26:46.680
No, I'll take that back. Jack Thompson compared this guy to Hitler, and that's one of the

26:46.680 --> 26:48.840
people that this group associates with.

26:48.840 --> 26:51.960
One of the things I was going to mention is, remember last week we were talking about how

26:51.960 --> 26:59.320
he was proposing that game companies create his game. Anyway, Penny Arcade, of course,

26:59.320 --> 27:03.520
he said he would pay $10,000 if his game was created. They were like, well, that's kind

27:03.520 --> 27:08.480
of weak because we donated half a million dollars for this charity. So what did he do?

27:08.480 --> 27:14.240
He found their phone number in their signature that was in their email and yelled at them,

27:14.240 --> 27:19.720
literally. Called them up and yelled. That was pretty lame.

27:19.720 --> 27:23.720
This guy is obviously mentally unstable. Now obviously this guy is becoming kind of

27:23.720 --> 27:29.880
like the laughing stock of the video game community, so now you're seeing him in all

27:29.880 --> 27:36.240
sorts of mods and what did you find? Well, it's the Jack Thompson murder simulator

27:36.240 --> 27:44.200
called Defamation of Character, and it's basically a mod for Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, and

27:44.200 --> 27:54.000
you can find this at hellfish.gtajunkies.com, and it's basically got his story. It's a video

27:54.000 --> 27:58.200
game featuring Jack Thompson doing incredibly violent things, in this particular case murdering

27:58.200 --> 28:01.160
Janet Reno and Doug Lowenstein, among others.

28:01.160 --> 28:03.760
That was the guy you compared to Hitler.

28:03.760 --> 28:07.400
Basically, they kind of go through what you can do.

28:07.400 --> 28:16.720
He is Jack Thompson, who also is his alter ego, Ban Man, who they actually have dressed

28:16.720 --> 28:20.200
up in some weird box and just some funny stuff.

28:20.200 --> 28:28.280
Anyways, you go through a bunch of different missions, including murdering, I believe it

28:28.280 --> 28:30.720
was two live crew, if I remember correctly.

28:30.720 --> 28:33.320
I don't think they're going to like that very much.

28:33.320 --> 28:38.920
Yeah, you're murdering two left crew who they have a picture on the website hanging, looks

28:38.920 --> 28:40.840
like upside down, dead from his ceiling.

28:40.840 --> 28:44.720
He was actually also the one responsible for the whole cop killer thing with Ice-T.

28:44.720 --> 28:47.120
Some of you guys have a lot of free time, I noticed out there.

28:47.120 --> 28:48.120
Yeah.

28:48.120 --> 28:49.120
Some of you gamers have a lot of free time.

28:49.120 --> 28:51.720
But I thought here's what was funny though.

28:51.720 --> 28:56.440
Some of the special abilities he had, he can do, of course, bullet time like every other

28:56.440 --> 28:57.440
game.

28:57.440 --> 29:01.400
He has legal immunity, basically when the police are coming or whatever, you can instantly

29:01.400 --> 29:07.500
to get them to go away. He has the Holy Escort, which is this Harrier jet that makes him invincible

29:07.500 --> 29:14.840
or something, and Press Relations, which you can basically just pull publicity stunt and

29:14.840 --> 29:16.240
get everyone to forget about stuff.

29:16.240 --> 29:20.500
Beautiful. Beautiful. Beautiful. All right. You know what? I need some real morality here

29:20.500 --> 29:26.000
on this show. I need some real morality, and I turned to Dark Sakura to bring that morality

29:26.000 --> 29:30.680
to this program, and she provides that for us every week with her weekly advice column,

29:30.680 --> 29:34.560
because you know there is more to life than just gaming because if uh...

29:34.560 --> 29:37.980
you played video games all day long you would have no time to watch the people's

29:37.980 --> 29:40.160
court

29:40.160 --> 29:43.500
Judge Wapner was cool. I know. Even that new lady that's on it is pretty awesome.

29:43.500 --> 29:45.840
She's pretty awesome. I just don't watch TV.

29:45.840 --> 29:50.680
Anyway, so DarkStalker, what are you going to be telling the kids about tonight?

29:50.680 --> 29:51.840
Today's bit of advice

29:51.840 --> 29:55.760
is excuses you can make for falling asleep at your desk at work and then how to fake

29:55.760 --> 29:57.640
being asleep at work.

29:57.640 --> 29:59.760
Awesome. I need this. I need to know this.

29:59.760 --> 30:02.960
To be asleep at your desk, first of all blame work.

30:02.960 --> 30:06.080
Say I'm so exhausted I was here until midnight last night.

30:06.080 --> 30:09.720
Do not attempt this if your boss works late and you do not.

30:09.720 --> 30:14.580
You know, I had a fellow coworker actually say that to me the other day.

30:14.580 --> 30:16.680
I wonder if that was something they were doing.

30:16.680 --> 30:19.340
Number two, blame medication.

30:19.340 --> 30:22.120
Claim that your new allergy medicine has been making you drowsy.

30:22.120 --> 30:24.640
Say those antihistamines just knock me out.

30:24.640 --> 30:27.860
It usually works for me because I hate men and girls.

30:27.860 --> 30:29.520
Number three, blame lunch.

30:29.520 --> 30:34.600
say, �Wow, I guess I should not have eaten that turkey sandwich. Tryptophan always makes

30:34.600 --> 30:38.600
me sleepy.�

30:38.600 --> 30:43.400
Be aware when taking a nap. Always rest your elbow on your desk and keep your arm perpendicular

30:43.400 --> 30:48.600
to the desktop. Your forehead should rest on your four fingers. Your thumb, spread apart

30:48.600 --> 30:52.640
from the fingers, should support your jaw. This position will keep your head up and aimed

30:52.640 --> 30:57.480
at your desk. Face in a direction so that it is not immediately visible to someone approaching

30:57.480 --> 31:03.000
your desk so that your eyes are closed. Keep an important group of documents in your perceived

31:03.000 --> 31:05.240
line of sight so as to appear to be reading intently.

31:05.240 --> 31:16.240
Do not stay up all night playing Final Fantasy XI, you freakin' addicts.

31:16.240 --> 31:22.240
or World of Warcraft or Ragnarok or whatever the hell the kids are playing these days.

31:22.240 --> 31:25.240
I never let that get in the way of my sleeve.

31:25.240 --> 31:30.240
I said when I was unemployed and had no excuse to go to bed.

31:30.240 --> 31:33.240
We've got some music game news for you guys tonight.

31:33.240 --> 31:37.240
Because you know, Orange Lounge, we were all about the music games when we started.

31:37.240 --> 31:39.240
We still are to some extent, but we talk about other video games too.

31:39.240 --> 31:41.240
But this is some big music game news.

31:41.240 --> 31:43.240
We've got Guitar Hero.

31:43.240 --> 31:45.240
It's that brand new game coming out.

31:45.240 --> 31:49.880
Those of you guys that were wishing and hoping that they would make like amplitude or frequency

31:49.880 --> 31:52.840
like a new one, from what I understand, they kind of have.

31:52.840 --> 31:56.440
They kind of did make a new one except it just involves a guitar and it's called Guitar

31:56.440 --> 31:57.440
Hero.

31:57.440 --> 31:58.600
Red Octane is the company that's putting this out.

31:58.600 --> 32:01.880
Red Octane, of course, is famous for making a lot of music game peripherals.

32:01.880 --> 32:02.880
And harmonics.

32:02.880 --> 32:03.880
And harmonics.

32:03.880 --> 32:06.880
Harmonics being the folks that did bring us amplitude.

32:06.880 --> 32:12.360
Harmonics developed the game, absolutely, and made Karaoke Revolution as well.

32:12.360 --> 32:16.800
X just wrapped up work on Guitar Hero, and Red Octane is going to put it out.

32:16.800 --> 32:19.400
It's scheduled to be out November 8th.

32:19.400 --> 32:20.400
Should be interesting.

32:20.400 --> 32:26.400
A lot of licensed songs in this game, including More Than a Feelin' by Boston, ZZ Top, Sharp

32:26.400 --> 32:29.080
Dressed Man, and Franz Ferdinand's Take Me Out.

32:29.080 --> 32:31.640
Now something interesting happened this past week, didn't it?

32:31.640 --> 32:36.100
I played More Than a Feelin' on Guitar Hero.

32:36.100 --> 32:40.440
We recorded a segment for the local news, KCRA.

32:40.440 --> 32:42.040
Nice folks.

32:42.040 --> 32:48.860
Playtesting guitar hero, and it was me and loki got to play it on my I had other other TV. I had other commitments

32:49.580 --> 32:52.180
First of all I have to say that that game looks

32:52.700 --> 32:54.700
Visually looks very sharp

32:55.540 --> 32:59.960
Being of an artistic background myself all the lights were singing that came was really cool

33:00.540 --> 33:02.300
The character models were great

33:02.300 --> 33:07.440
There's even a Keith Richards look-alike who and me being the big gorillas fangirl that I am I was like

33:07.440 --> 33:12.040
first of all seeing that hair and sing and play a flying V I was like oh my

33:12.040 --> 33:15.640
god it's Murdoch but it it was really just based directly off of Keith

33:15.640 --> 33:19.800
Richards which he was based off of Keith Richards too anyway back away from my

33:19.800 --> 33:29.560
nerdom um it has an excellent song list um I played um I want to be sedated and

33:29.560 --> 33:34.640
then I played more than a feelin which I love Boston and I love the Ramones so

33:34.640 --> 33:41.840
There was also Stevie Ray Vaughan in it, Franz Ferdinand, Megadeth, and it's not the actual

33:41.840 --> 33:44.400
bands, but the folks that they had play in the music was just...

33:44.400 --> 33:48.000
Kind of like Karaoke Revolution, where they have a cover band do it, yeah.

33:48.000 --> 33:51.920
But there was some real skill that went into the guitar playing on the game, and on top

33:51.920 --> 33:54.920
of that, the controller.

33:54.920 --> 33:58.880
First of all, the controller design was body style licensed by Gibson.

33:58.880 --> 34:02.320
Gibson and MTV are both backing the game.

34:02.320 --> 34:08.040
In fact, the guitars in the game are all licensed by Gibson.

34:08.040 --> 34:09.040
Sounds cool.

34:09.040 --> 34:10.040
Loki, I'm curious what you thought.

34:10.040 --> 34:11.040
It was awesome.

34:11.040 --> 34:24.300
I got to play Smoke on the Water, and Iron Man, and he was like, take me out, and just

34:24.300 --> 34:25.300
really cool.

34:25.300 --> 34:30.840
A really fun game to get into, since I'm a big fan of Guitar Freaks, this is definitely

34:30.840 --> 34:34.180
step in the right direction, because I like how they have the extra buttons on there so

34:34.180 --> 34:37.580
it is a little bit more difficult, so for those people that did actually master, you

34:37.580 --> 34:41.460
know, Guitar Freaks, this is a whole new challenge for you.

34:41.460 --> 34:46.500
Yeah, I'm just, I didn't get to play it, unfortunately, but I'm just excited that we're getting like

34:46.500 --> 34:50.660
amplitude, but like different with a new peripheral, I'm just, because I love frequency, I loved

34:50.660 --> 34:52.140
amplitude, I'm kind of excited.

34:52.140 --> 34:55.720
Being that I heavily imported all the Guitar Freaks games that I could get my hands on

34:55.720 --> 35:01.080
except for the appends there's no comparison this game guitar hero really

35:01.080 --> 35:05.080
blows it out of the water the music quality being that you're going from

35:05.080 --> 35:10.840
basically MIDI to real you know instruments guitar freaks has also just

35:10.840 --> 35:14.120
kind of gotten stale over like 13 mixes or something like that right it's like

35:14.120 --> 35:19.920
Simon it's like playing Simon you know press the button in the right order but

35:19.920 --> 35:23.600
this because you've got the five keys and on top of that the way that you move

35:23.600 --> 35:27.960
your hand they're calling him fret buttons I think you've got a whammy bar

35:27.960 --> 35:33.760
on it geez how much cooler can you get I mean I know I'm gushing about it but I

35:33.760 --> 35:39.200
I've got my game on reserve already the controller itself is suitably more

35:39.200 --> 35:43.520
substantial than the guitar freaks controller $69.99 is what it's gonna set

35:43.520 --> 35:48.680
you back and it comes out November 8th T for teen it must have some hard lyrics

35:48.680 --> 35:49.680
in there or something.

35:49.680 --> 35:50.680
It's not an EA game.

35:50.680 --> 35:51.680
We've got Megadeth.

35:51.680 --> 35:52.680
I guess so.

35:52.680 --> 35:54.840
You know, throw the horns.

35:54.840 --> 35:55.840
Sounds good.

35:55.840 --> 35:57.760
Also, another music gaming related story.

35:57.760 --> 35:58.760
I thought this was interesting.

35:58.760 --> 36:02.560
Of course, you know Konami puts out Dance Dance Revolution well.

36:02.560 --> 36:06.920
What they're doing is they are teaming up with 24 Hour Fitness, which I think is very

36:06.920 --> 36:08.280
interesting.

36:08.280 --> 36:13.720
They're going to be putting a 30-day free gym pass to 24 Hour Fitness inside copies

36:13.720 --> 36:15.760
of DDR Extreme 2, the new ones.

36:15.760 --> 36:18.500
ones I mean obviously it's already been being sold but as the new ones come out

36:18.500 --> 36:22.840
they're gonna have a 30-day free pass 24-hour Fitness and 24-hour Fitness is

36:22.840 --> 36:29.300
going to put DDR machines in their kids club portions of the gyms not I don't

36:29.300 --> 36:31.900
think they have kids club at all the gyms but you know the ones that do they're

36:31.900 --> 36:35.020
some of them are gonna have DDR machines so an interesting confusion there

36:35.020 --> 36:39.700
between Dance Dance Revolution and a legitimate gymnasium interesting I think

36:39.700 --> 36:43.940
that it's a fascinating marketing tool and it's sort of one that we see we've

36:43.940 --> 36:48.180
seen it coming. With all the schools that are putting DDR machines in their fitness

36:48.180 --> 36:52.500
programs, it was inevitable.

36:52.500 --> 36:56.940
Konami was also working on DDR Studio, I think it was, where they actually, it was going

36:56.940 --> 37:02.820
to be like an eight-person DDR thing, and it was crazy. It was meant for gyms, although

37:02.820 --> 37:06.400
we didn't really see if this ever got actually implemented. It's interesting to see this

37:06.400 --> 37:08.060
partnership take place, so.

37:08.060 --> 37:11.540
I still think Pata Pata would have been a better choice.

37:11.540 --> 37:13.260
Yeah, but no.

37:13.260 --> 37:16.220
Get your upper body moving, but then you'd have to listen to the music.

37:16.220 --> 37:17.220
I didn't mean anything.

37:17.220 --> 37:18.220
I'm kidding.

37:18.220 --> 37:19.220
There's nothing wrong with the Eurobeat.

37:19.220 --> 37:20.220
I'm kidding.

37:20.220 --> 37:24.420
I watch Initial D. Rhythm gymnastics, the game.

37:24.420 --> 37:25.420
Alright.

37:25.420 --> 37:26.420
Rhythm masters.

37:26.420 --> 37:29.460
Now, you guys have some news on Dead or Alive 4.

37:29.460 --> 37:30.460
I want to hear this stuff.

37:30.460 --> 37:32.860
Dark Soccer, what did you have on Dead or Alive 4?

37:32.860 --> 37:33.860
DOA4.

37:33.860 --> 37:36.540
Well, their lobby system has been revealed.

37:36.540 --> 37:40.380
Famitsu was talking about it.

37:40.380 --> 37:44.120
The description that I have seen is that it is a

37:44.120 --> 37:47.780
wacky. The lobby features 10 various

37:47.780 --> 37:51.240
areas. There's like a Halloween theme, a swamp room that you swim through.

37:51.240 --> 37:54.480
Which, you know, honestly it totally just

37:54.480 --> 37:58.920
fits, you know, what I would have expected of me if they gave us a Volleyball.

37:58.920 --> 38:02.300
They'd have to do something goofy. You also have

38:02.300 --> 38:06.340
various avatars. I believe that there is around 30.

38:06.340 --> 38:11.020
You also can have like a ninja, ghost, cat,

38:11.020 --> 38:14.780
penguin. You get a penguin, Rom? Awesome. And

38:14.780 --> 38:18.940
each lobby can hold a maximum of 20 people and you can chat with people and watch

38:18.940 --> 38:21.700
fights that are taking place on a widescreen display.

38:21.700 --> 38:24.860
No screenshots yet,

38:24.860 --> 38:28.120
but of course there's shots of the game out there.

38:28.120 --> 38:32.400
But it was in the recent issue of Famitsu. Interesting. Before I get to Loki's side, I just want to say

38:32.400 --> 38:34.200
something real quick about Famitsu Magazine

38:34.200 --> 38:37.480
because it kinda relates to Xbox. They actually just did a study on how the

38:37.480 --> 38:40.160
Japanese are kinda looking at the next generation of systems.

38:40.160 --> 38:45.360
24 percent say that they do want to get an Xbox 360. 40 percent

38:45.360 --> 38:49.480
are still undecided. PlayStation 3, way ahead still.

38:49.480 --> 38:53.160
But it's interesting because the Xbox is making a little bit of progress because the Xbox

38:53.160 --> 38:56.320
One or whatever you want to call it, the regular Xbox, kinda

38:56.320 --> 38:59.880
thudded in Japan a little bit. But 360 seems to be getting more awareness.

38:59.880 --> 39:00.880
That's very interesting.

39:00.880 --> 39:02.840
Loki, what do you have on DLA for?

39:02.840 --> 39:06.760
Well, it's been mentioned that there was going to be a guest character in this game, which

39:06.760 --> 39:10.160
was going to be from Halo, or the Halo series.

39:10.160 --> 39:16.200
The guest character they've announced, and actually have screenshots of, is actually

39:16.200 --> 39:21.240
Spartan 458, a female character, I believe from Halo 2.

39:21.240 --> 39:25.840
And it, I mean, to be honest, looks exactly like Master Chief.

39:25.840 --> 39:28.960
So you get to play this game with this character.

39:28.960 --> 39:36.560
They said that possibly some alternate costumes that might reveal more of her, you know?

39:36.560 --> 39:39.720
We are forgetting what DOA is all about.

39:39.720 --> 39:43.640
Of course they put in a female Master Chief.

39:43.640 --> 39:44.640
Of course.

39:44.640 --> 39:48.520
If I'm a betting man, I'm going to say the code is probably Justin Bailey.

39:48.520 --> 39:49.520
Yeah.

39:49.520 --> 39:57.000
Yeah, but I don't think that Was It Tecmo had anything to do with Metroid?

39:57.000 --> 39:58.000
Whatever.

39:58.000 --> 40:05.440
Moving on, I've got a quick news for you guys, it relates to Final Fantasy Advent Children.

40:05.440 --> 40:11.700
Seven hundred thousand copies sold since September 14th when it came out in Japan, and seven

40:11.700 --> 40:17.680
million copies pirated on BitTorrent in the U.S., just kidding, I don't know, I don't

40:17.680 --> 40:18.680
know for sure.

40:18.680 --> 40:22.920
Don't forget, there's a big pre-order push for that.

40:22.920 --> 40:29.900
Even today, on the Advent Children release date schedule, it's basically now the end

40:29.900 --> 40:30.900
of January.

40:30.900 --> 40:33.620
I think January 29th is what I heard.

40:33.620 --> 40:34.620
But then I could be wrong.

40:34.620 --> 40:35.620
Oh my, again?

40:35.620 --> 40:36.620
No.

40:36.620 --> 40:37.620
End of January.

40:37.620 --> 40:38.620
Are they foolish?

40:38.620 --> 40:39.620
Because this thing's all over the internet.

40:39.620 --> 40:41.820
Unless they're going back to add extra content to make us want to get the DVD.

40:41.820 --> 40:42.820
I don't know.

40:42.820 --> 40:48.220
I think they're going to be pushing, I'm hoping that it's going to be a theater release.

40:48.220 --> 40:54.700
Where actually I have heard from other, though I cannot say who, reputable sources that are

40:54.700 --> 40:56.900
saying that it's going to be a limited theater run.

40:56.900 --> 41:00.100
Well that would be good.

41:00.100 --> 41:01.100
Maybe IMAX?

41:01.100 --> 41:04.660
I remember mentioning that a while back, that I had heard that IMAX was what they were gunning

41:04.660 --> 41:05.660
for.

41:05.660 --> 41:06.660
That would be pretty amazing.

41:06.660 --> 41:08.660
That might be a fanboy's wet dream, I don't know.

41:08.660 --> 41:09.660
We'll see.

41:09.660 --> 41:10.660
It's my wet dream.

41:10.660 --> 41:13.600
Anyway, thanks for sharing.

41:13.600 --> 41:17.840

41:35.940 --> 41:36.500

41:36.500 --> 41:38.620
but i think that uh...

41:38.620 --> 41:40.340
ten kite g

41:40.340 --> 41:43.400
I think I know how to pronounce Japanese.

41:43.400 --> 41:47.800
Duel Master, Shadow of the Code, Fear, which I know a lot of people are looking forward

41:47.800 --> 41:49.160
to.

41:49.160 --> 41:56.520
Fable of the Lost Chapters, Genji, which is already out over here, LA Rush for PS2, Xbox,

41:56.520 --> 42:01.760
Marvel Nemesis, Rise of the Imperfects, Namco Museum, Battle Collection, Pokemon Emerald,

42:01.760 --> 42:08.880
Rengoku, UFO Aftershock, WRC Rally Edition, and X3 Reunion.

42:08.880 --> 42:15.900
couple of notables of the 28th we have a Dancing Stage Mario mix we have Makai

42:15.900 --> 42:20.880
Kingdom Chronicles of the Sacred Tome for PS2 pack and roll on the 28th you

42:20.880 --> 42:25.080
mentioned fable in there and our fable lost chapters which is out here already

42:25.080 --> 42:28.560
but I just have one quick minor bitch about fable it doesn't work with my TV

42:28.560 --> 42:33.180
it looks like garbage on my TV like like my HD wigs out on it like there's

42:33.180 --> 42:36.720
something weird about the mode it uses I hope the 360 doesn't do the same thing

42:36.720 --> 42:40.720
But that's the only game that I have problems with out of my collection.

42:40.720 --> 42:41.720
I have quite a few games.

42:41.720 --> 42:42.720
Get the Lost Chapters that's coming out.

42:42.720 --> 42:45.720
I don't want the Lost Chapters. I want to play the one I bought.

42:45.720 --> 42:47.720
No! You want the Lost Chapters.

42:47.720 --> 42:50.720
See something also November just that might be a little fun.

42:50.720 --> 42:53.720
Sing Star 80s on the PS2.

42:53.720 --> 42:54.720
Sing Star.

42:54.720 --> 42:57.720
And Donkey Kong Country 3 for the GBA.

42:57.720 --> 43:00.720
I'm like, cool, it's Donkey Kong Country.

43:00.720 --> 43:01.720
Alright.

43:01.720 --> 43:02.720
Yeah.

43:02.720 --> 43:06.720
You also had something about Alien Hominid, which was a game that's out here, but...

43:06.720 --> 43:08.720
What about Alien Hominid?

43:08.720 --> 43:14.720
They are releasing downloadable level packs for owners of Alien Hominid for the Xbox.

43:14.720 --> 43:22.720
Some of the level packs are saying there's the Chicken Pack and the Ultra Hyperload, both containing 25 levels.

43:22.720 --> 43:26.720
And so far, it sounds like they're going to be free downloads.

43:26.720 --> 43:31.720
When it said Ultra Hyperload, I was just picturing a long-ass loading screen.

43:31.720 --> 43:36.720
Alien Hamed or whatever it's called, not a game that I was very interested in.

43:36.720 --> 43:40.720
I watched Loki play it for a length of time and I thought, how boring.

43:40.720 --> 43:44.720
I love the comment on here, just a quote from Eurogamer.

43:44.720 --> 43:50.720
Mothers, buying your kids 2D shooters will make them better geeks in years to come.

43:50.720 --> 43:55.720
I have some news regarding Castlevania because I've been playing, of course, the DS one a lot.

43:55.720 --> 44:00.720
Well, there are brand new Castlevania games coming out for the Xbox and PlayStation 2.

44:00.720 --> 44:05.160
It's Curse of Darkness is the game coming out, should be very cool there.

44:05.160 --> 44:08.960
It's set three years after Castlevania III, Dracula's Curse,

44:08.960 --> 44:12.120
and Curse of Darkness follows, I guess, a new character,

44:12.120 --> 44:15.520
Hector, a former minion of Dracula.

44:15.520 --> 44:19.680
Should be interesting. November 1st is the day, that's just around the corner.

44:19.680 --> 44:24.440
$49.99, M for Mature, because you know it's got lots of blood and the good stuff.

44:24.440 --> 44:28.240
Should be a good game though. I hope it's a little better than Lament of

44:28.240 --> 44:30.480
Innocence. Not that Lament of Innocence was bad,

44:30.480 --> 44:33.480
But it wasn't Symphony of the Night.

44:33.480 --> 44:39.480
I'm more looking forward to Matrix of the Path of Neo coming out that same week.

44:39.480 --> 44:43.480
I did just find something very interesting that I'm looking forward to.

44:43.480 --> 44:44.480
What's that?

44:44.480 --> 44:47.480
A Bone game. You remember Bone? The comic?

44:47.480 --> 44:49.480
Oh, okay.

44:49.480 --> 45:02.480
I just glanced over here. Telltale Games, apparently they're releasing a bone game.

45:02.480 --> 45:03.480
Interesting.

45:03.480 --> 45:09.840
Yeah, I will try to go into more of this next week. I just saw this. But I mean, for anyone

45:09.840 --> 45:13.320
who's fans of the series, it actually looks pretty cool. I found the link on the front

45:13.320 --> 45:17.000
page of Eurogamer this week, so I would suggest everyone check that out.

45:17.000 --> 45:20.200
maybe you'll get some emails on it speaking of emails to go at orange

45:20.200 --> 45:21.600
lounge radio dot com

45:21.600 --> 45:24.540
we get emails we like to read some of them on the air we don't have time to

45:24.540 --> 45:27.080
read all of them but we do read them all

45:27.080 --> 45:30.120
and we love you guys for writing us and letting us know you care

45:30.120 --> 45:34.240
uh... but we want to respond to some on air right now so dark sakura what is in

45:34.240 --> 45:36.400
that the old orange launch radio mailbag

45:36.400 --> 45:37.640
well the uh...

45:37.640 --> 45:43.160
the one about the comparing the just how bad that video game law is

45:43.160 --> 45:44.840
and that was actually sent to us by rob

45:44.840 --> 45:50.800
Oh yeah, he's king of our forums lately too, he's a nice guy.

45:50.800 --> 45:53.720
Great addition to our forums, yeah.

45:53.720 --> 45:58.400
Also we have one from Paul in Belfast, Northern Ireland.

45:58.400 --> 45:59.640
Oh, right on.

45:59.640 --> 46:02.520
I'm really glad to hear we've got listeners so far.

46:02.520 --> 46:04.800
International, I love hearing from the international folks.

46:04.800 --> 46:07.080
He has a question for us.

46:07.080 --> 46:09.320
I will just read this.

46:09.320 --> 46:13.440
My question is have you ever given it some thought of doing a video of your podcast for

46:13.440 --> 46:16.820
us to download on PSP like they do with DigNation.

46:16.820 --> 46:21.020
It would be totally cool, just a thought.

46:21.020 --> 46:26.520
Here's the problem with videocast is that it's more money to get a video set up and

46:26.520 --> 46:27.900
all that stuff.

46:27.900 --> 46:29.920
I would love to do it.

46:29.920 --> 46:33.760
It's just a matter, the execution is how in the hell are we going to do something like

46:33.760 --> 46:34.760
that?

46:34.760 --> 46:37.320
When you're talking about dig and stuff like that, I mean that's backed by people who have

46:37.320 --> 46:42.800
been in the television industry already, so they kind of have their ties on how to do

46:42.800 --> 46:47.440
it do that kind of stuff and we don't really have that we've got I've got a

46:47.440 --> 46:52.100
little crappy 15 year old in the recorder but I don't know what kind of a

46:52.100 --> 46:55.880
TV show we could do with that let's just it's a lot lot more time because I have

46:55.880 --> 47:00.160
worked in you know television in college and stuff it is more time preparing

47:00.160 --> 47:04.700
stuff for the internet is yeah I'm willing to do it but it's again it's

47:04.700 --> 47:10.760
just a matter of the fact that we have a budget of zero dollars and no place to

47:10.760 --> 47:13.920
shoot it and that once I get my camcorder

47:13.920 --> 47:18.520
huh I think that it might might eventually be feasible to do a special

47:18.520 --> 47:21.640
it's it's in the back of our minds we want to do it and that that place we

47:21.640 --> 47:24.000
were at that that warehouse we were at the other night

47:24.000 --> 47:27.440
I thought would be a fabulous place to do an orange lounge type

47:27.440 --> 47:31.040
thing and I told you about that already I I

47:31.040 --> 47:33.560
we have ideas it's something that's constantly been sitting in the back my

47:33.560 --> 47:34.760
mind someday

47:34.760 --> 47:37.840
someday especially with this new iTunes 6.0 and the way that they're really

47:37.840 --> 47:39.880
pushing video now with the new video iPods

47:39.880 --> 47:44.980
Of course, we like PSPs as well, and we've been trying to support that.

47:44.980 --> 47:46.660
It's a natural evolution of the show.

47:46.660 --> 47:47.660
I want to see it happen.

47:47.660 --> 47:49.660
It's just not going to happen cheaply.

47:49.660 --> 47:52.660
That means I have to go buy a veil.

47:52.660 --> 47:53.660
Any other mails?

47:53.660 --> 47:54.660
Yeah.

47:54.660 --> 47:57.820
I won last one tonight.

47:57.820 --> 47:59.700
One of our listeners, Joseph, wrote in.

47:59.700 --> 48:01.380
He's won the one-two round.

48:01.380 --> 48:02.380
Oh, he won.

48:02.380 --> 48:03.380
The rare CD.

48:03.380 --> 48:04.380
Yeah.

48:04.380 --> 48:06.980
By the way, those prizes are on their way.

48:06.980 --> 48:15.940
He would like for us to plug that they're having their Pali Bimani Games Day at Cal

48:15.940 --> 48:29.300
Pali in San Luis Obispo, at the Chumash Auditorium inside the University Union at Cal Pali State.

48:29.300 --> 48:33.260
They've asked us to go, but you're going to be busy with the podcast awards that we get.

48:33.260 --> 48:38.580
I actually am going to be at the Podcast Awards on the 11th and staying in San Diego to go

48:38.580 --> 48:40.860
buy wine.

48:40.860 --> 48:42.180
I might be putting in an appearance.

48:42.180 --> 48:46.740
I have to check my calendar, see if I can do it feasibly, but I would like to do it,

48:46.740 --> 48:47.740
so we'll see.

48:47.740 --> 48:50.020
I'll get back to these folks.

48:50.020 --> 48:51.020
Still seem...

48:51.020 --> 48:52.020
Yeah.

48:52.020 --> 48:53.020
Yeah.

48:53.020 --> 48:54.020
We'll see.

48:54.020 --> 48:58.020
Loki's a little harder to get to do the PR things.

48:58.020 --> 49:00.740
Gee, I wonder why.

49:00.740 --> 49:01.740
I want to do it.

49:01.740 --> 49:02.740
It sounds like fun.

49:02.740 --> 49:03.740
We'll see.

49:03.740 --> 49:06.980
I'm not coming by myself, though, so I'm bringing a random...

49:06.980 --> 49:10.380
I might have to bring XtoFur from Orange Line Radio's live show.

49:10.380 --> 49:11.380
That would be hilarious.

49:11.380 --> 49:12.380
We'll see.

49:12.380 --> 49:13.380
We'll see.

49:13.380 --> 49:14.380
We'll do it.

49:14.380 --> 49:15.380
Take the DigiCam with you.

49:15.380 --> 49:16.380
If I go, I definitely will.

49:16.380 --> 49:18.340
I'll get in touch with this guy on email.

49:18.340 --> 49:22.500
But yeah, I'm already going to the podcast awards, or I would be more than thrilled to

49:22.500 --> 49:23.500
go.

49:23.500 --> 49:24.500
Sorry.

49:24.500 --> 49:27.140
I also would like to go to the podcast awards, but I can't, but that's a very bitter subject,

49:27.140 --> 49:29.140
so we won't go there.

49:29.140 --> 49:30.140
Yeah.

49:30.140 --> 49:31.140
Real life sucks sometimes.

49:31.140 --> 49:32.140
What can you say?

49:32.140 --> 49:33.140
I have some more fun, though.

49:33.140 --> 49:34.140
Oh, okay.

49:34.140 --> 49:35.140
Good.

49:35.140 --> 49:36.140
I want fun.

49:36.140 --> 49:37.140
You remember our friend Steven Spielberg?

49:37.140 --> 49:40.620
Didn't we have lunch with him last week?

49:40.620 --> 49:41.620
Actually...

49:41.620 --> 49:42.620
I told him to kiss my ass.

49:42.620 --> 49:44.420
I want more money for the show.

49:44.420 --> 49:50.420
I ran into... well, not ran into him, but I was eating dinner at Skywalker Ranch.

49:50.420 --> 49:51.420
Is it...

49:51.420 --> 49:53.340
George Lucas walked past us and I almost flicked...

49:53.340 --> 49:55.780
You tell that Lucas story every chance you can.

49:55.780 --> 49:56.780
It was cool.

49:56.780 --> 49:57.780
It was cool.

49:57.780 --> 49:58.780
Oh, that's cool.

49:58.780 --> 49:59.780
Oh, my God.

49:59.780 --> 50:00.780
He's in meatloaf-flicking distance.

50:00.780 --> 50:01.780
All right.

50:01.780 --> 50:07.700
Little Quickie, he has basically signed a deal with Electronic Arts to publish three

50:07.700 --> 50:10.340
original game properties.

50:10.340 --> 50:12.740
Will they be overrated like his movies?

50:12.740 --> 50:15.500
Likely, but you know, only time will tell.

50:15.500 --> 50:16.900
Ooh, I'm looking forward to it.

50:16.900 --> 50:18.660
Well, it wouldn't be an original property.

50:18.660 --> 50:21.220
Yeah, it's going to be original since no Indiana Jones.

50:21.220 --> 50:23.260
I want War of the Worlds.

50:23.260 --> 50:29.100
He has been quoted as saying the new technology represents the future of cinema, and in the

50:29.100 --> 50:35.400
future, you will physically be inside the experience.

50:35.400 --> 50:36.400
Inside the experience.

50:36.400 --> 50:40.260
Another thing they were asking how it's going to work, he said, I invented it, but because

50:40.260 --> 50:44.540
the patent is pending, I can't discuss it right now.

50:44.540 --> 50:49.540
Hopefully being inside the experience includes Pamela Anderson.

50:49.540 --> 50:56.820
Moving on, moving on, let's get to a story that Loki's got about PSP on the TV.

50:56.820 --> 50:58.660
It's something that you've been following for a little while.

50:58.660 --> 51:04.500
Yes, everybody wants the PSP to be on the TV, I mean, you've got the UMD movies which

51:04.500 --> 51:06.740
are selling like crazy, of course.

51:06.740 --> 51:15.460
The first thing, of course, they have the PSP2TV, which is actually kind of an add-on

51:15.460 --> 51:19.180
modification that you can do to your PSP system.

51:19.180 --> 51:23.260
The new one now, though, is kind of using, I would say, smoke and mirrors.

51:23.260 --> 51:26.980
It's kind of a device that looks very similar to what they're making for Metal Gear Acid

51:26.980 --> 51:33.060
2 plugs into the top and then I guess like a scanner kind of re-encodes everything and

51:33.060 --> 51:36.380
puts it on your TV. I don't know. I don't know about that working.

51:36.380 --> 51:38.220
Sounds crazy. Okay.

51:38.220 --> 51:42.340
But it doesn't require modification and I think that's kind of the selling point of

51:42.340 --> 51:43.340
it.

51:43.340 --> 51:47.940
Okay. Okay. That's cool. You also had a story about now like a mod for the Nintendo, like

51:47.940 --> 51:50.180
with the GBA Micro being so popular right now.

51:50.180 --> 51:58.620
Yes, actually the guy behind all those portable systems, like the portable Atari Ben Heck,

51:58.620 --> 52:06.200
he actually created a brand new NES Micro, as he calls it, and they've got screenshots

52:06.200 --> 52:08.520
on his site here on BenHeck.com.

52:08.520 --> 52:17.960
The NES Micro is smaller than the cartridge, the cartridge is pretty small, pretty thick

52:17.960 --> 52:22.340
also but the cartridge is twice the size of the micro yeah it's still pretty

52:22.340 --> 52:26.780
small they have it um you know side by side with the micro and it's about you

52:26.780 --> 52:30.980
know about a half an inch bigger Wow is that is that Ninja Gaiden they're

52:30.980 --> 52:35.540
playing right now on the NES micro Mega Man 2 oh I thought I saw Ninja Gaiden

52:35.540 --> 52:37.980
in one of those pictures I was gonna say good choice but Mega Man 2 is a good

52:37.980 --> 52:43.220
choice too yeah so that's kind of cool pretty nifty sounds good

52:43.220 --> 52:48.220
Dark Soccer, you had one kind of too bad story about GameStop?

52:48.220 --> 52:50.220
Yeah, last one for me.

52:50.220 --> 52:54.220
GameStop is cutting 700 jobs in the Philadelphia area,

52:54.220 --> 52:57.220
like immediately after this merger has taken place.

52:57.220 --> 53:01.220
They've shut down the corporate office

53:01.220 --> 53:04.220
and have also shut down the distribution center.

53:04.220 --> 53:05.220
A VB?

53:05.220 --> 53:06.220
Yes.

53:06.220 --> 53:10.220
However, they're saying that other than the game stores currently in existence,

53:10.220 --> 53:15.500
since the GameStop ones, they're not going to have that big of a presence, they're not

53:15.500 --> 53:19.980
going to really shift things, and from what I've heard, a lot of the EB's are still going

53:19.980 --> 53:22.380
to stay and keep operating under the EB name.

53:22.380 --> 53:23.380
Oh, interesting.

53:23.380 --> 53:26.900
So that explains what's going to happen when you have a mall and you have EB, which is

53:26.900 --> 53:30.940
like right up, like we have here in Sacramento, we have a mall where the show's based, we

53:30.940 --> 53:34.900
have a mall where there's a GameStop and then like right around the corner there's an EB

53:34.900 --> 53:36.260
next to the Cinnabon.

53:36.260 --> 53:38.220
I don't think either of those stores are going anywhere.

53:38.220 --> 53:39.220
Right.

53:39.220 --> 53:46.220
Well, people probably wondered, you know, with a merger is EB going to be GameStop and you just have two GameStops in the mall, which would be a little crazy.

53:46.220 --> 53:55.220
I believe it's still operating under, well, they said, from what I understand, they were supposed to dissolve the EB name, however, the EB stores are still there, so I don't know how they're going to manage that.

53:55.220 --> 53:56.220
Interesting.

53:56.220 --> 53:58.220
Let's say I have GameStop A and GameStop B.

53:58.220 --> 53:59.220
GameStop A and GameStop B.

53:59.220 --> 54:00.220
And for the record...

54:00.220 --> 54:07.220
Well, it could be like Express Men and Express Women, they could have GameStop Nintendo and GameStop Xbox and GameStop Sony, it'd be interesting.

54:07.220 --> 54:11.960
I do need to correct myself, though, as far as Barnes & Noble's involvement in that, GameStop

54:11.960 --> 54:16.600
is now a fully functioning business.

54:16.600 --> 54:21.380
They're still associated with Barnes & Noble, but they are their own business.

54:21.380 --> 54:24.400
No longer a fully owned subsidy, I should say.

54:24.400 --> 54:27.400
I got one last story for you guys, and we'll let Loki finish this out tonight, because

54:27.400 --> 54:29.720
I think his thing's a little bit cooler.

54:29.720 --> 54:32.040
My last thing is Soul Calibur 3.

54:32.040 --> 54:33.360
I can't believe I saved this for last.

54:33.360 --> 54:34.640
This is big news.

54:34.640 --> 54:37.640
Soul Calibur 3, though, for me, it feels like it's been flying under the radar a little

54:37.640 --> 54:38.640
bit.

54:38.640 --> 54:41.040
Maybe it's just because I'm not following the same news I used to, but I remember Soul

54:41.040 --> 54:43.800
Calibur 2 was, like, this huge frickin' deal.

54:43.800 --> 54:47.400
Soul Calibur 3, certainly if you're a fighting game fan, is still a huge deal, but this one's

54:47.400 --> 54:51.240
kind of been seeming to fly under the radar for me, but it's still gonna look like a cool

54:51.240 --> 54:52.240
game, nonetheless.

54:52.240 --> 54:57.320
Maybe it's because, A, it doesn't have Link in it, and B, I know, but it wasn't the whole

54:57.320 --> 54:58.320
game.

54:58.320 --> 55:00.080
I mean, the arcade version of Soul Calibur 2 is awesome.

55:00.080 --> 55:02.120
Ivy is the whole game, really, is what it was.

55:02.120 --> 55:04.700
The Xbox version of Soul Calibur 2 was awesome.

55:04.700 --> 55:08.140
Anyway, Soul Calibur 3 is for the Playstation 2.

55:08.140 --> 55:11.780
It's coming out October 25th, which I was kind of surprised, I was like, whoa, that

55:11.780 --> 55:13.200
was quick.

55:13.200 --> 55:15.340
Also rated T for Teen, $49.99.

55:15.340 --> 55:20.780
Of course, the big thing about this is that you're going to be able to do some, create

55:20.780 --> 55:23.960
your own character, which I think will be very interesting.

55:23.960 --> 55:24.960
So we'll see.

55:24.960 --> 55:26.900
I definitely want to review this game on a later show.

55:26.900 --> 55:31.980
Loki, take us out tonight with a story about Flash.

55:31.980 --> 55:38.580
kind of a little promo thing. They have actually, as part of GameSpot, you can actually play

55:38.580 --> 55:42.540
the whole Prince of Persia via Flash on the Internet.

55:42.540 --> 55:45.220
Like the old-ass Prince of Persia. We're not talking the sands of time.

55:45.220 --> 55:46.520
Yes. Wasn't there anything about the Prince of

55:46.520 --> 55:53.640
Persia that was on like the NES, the Commodore 64, the Apple, the Game Boy? It was on like

55:53.640 --> 56:00.140
every system ever at that time. That's correct. You can find us at www.gamespot.com

56:00.140 --> 56:08.220
slash promo slash Prince of Persia dash game slash flash. That's it. Interesting.

56:08.220 --> 56:13.500
Slash partridge in a pear tree dot org. Check that out you guys. dot EU.

56:13.500 --> 56:21.660
Alright, couple really quick things. PSP firmware 2.5 came out that allows the

56:21.660 --> 56:25.780
movies on the go type thing where you can stream over the internet. Too bad that

56:25.780 --> 56:32.640
the peripheral that you need to use that is $350, so that sucks for everybody.

56:32.640 --> 56:35.540
There's a brand new viral marketing campaign out.

56:35.540 --> 56:37.180
Oh God, one of those websites.

56:37.180 --> 56:38.840
Yep, that's right.

56:38.840 --> 56:48.480
It's actually hex168, I believe is what it is, hex168.com, it's supposed to finish in

56:48.480 --> 56:49.640
two days.

56:49.640 --> 56:54.040
People are thinking it might be the announcement of World of Warcraft for the 360.

56:54.040 --> 56:55.040
I doubt it.

56:55.040 --> 56:56.040
about that.

56:56.040 --> 57:01.480
But anyways, that was just kind of interesting and the other thing is, and this is kind of

57:01.480 --> 57:05.080
a disappointment to me, Elder Scrolls IV got pushed back to December.

57:05.080 --> 57:06.960
Another launch game getting pushed back.

57:06.960 --> 57:07.960
Go figure.

57:07.960 --> 57:09.960
Couple weeks, but you know, December.

57:09.960 --> 57:10.960
Still.

57:10.960 --> 57:11.960
Still.

57:11.960 --> 57:12.960
Still.

57:12.960 --> 57:13.960
Yeah, so that's lame.

57:13.960 --> 57:14.960
That's it.

57:14.960 --> 57:15.960
That's going to do it.

57:15.960 --> 57:16.960
That's the show, you guys.

57:16.960 --> 57:17.960
Final thoughts.

57:17.960 --> 57:18.960
Loki.

57:18.960 --> 57:19.960
I need to play more games this week.

57:19.960 --> 57:22.920
SSX on tour looks awesome, I can't wait.

57:22.920 --> 57:26.960
My final thought is World of Warcraft, setting things on fire, full report next week.

57:26.960 --> 57:29.000
Dark Sakura.

57:29.000 --> 57:31.040
Reject pulse icons.

57:31.040 --> 57:32.680
And that's all.

57:32.680 --> 57:35.240
And one more thing, more fun stuff coming to the PSP site.

57:35.240 --> 57:36.640
You had your last thought.

57:36.640 --> 57:37.640
Alright.

57:37.640 --> 57:42.440
Yes, check out the PSP site, OLRPSP.com, we haven't plugged that yet.

57:42.440 --> 57:46.440
You know what though, we have barely heard from somebody this entire show.

57:46.440 --> 57:47.800
Who's that?

57:47.800 --> 57:50.520
Yes, our little pet ferret.

57:50.520 --> 57:51.520
What are those things called?

57:51.520 --> 57:52.520
Scoosies?

57:52.520 --> 57:53.520
Scott the Ferret.

57:53.520 --> 57:57.800
You know, in the little album art for our show, you see him, like really, really tiny.

57:57.800 --> 58:01.360
I have just been sad and now I've been reunited with my Ferret friend.

58:01.360 --> 58:06.320
Alright, we're done, we're done, thanks for telling us, check us out next week, we'll

58:06.320 --> 58:08.240
be back as always.

58:08.240 --> 58:09.240
Have we ever missed a week?

58:09.240 --> 58:10.240
I don't know.

58:10.240 --> 58:13.240
I want a vacation, when do I get a vacation?

58:13.240 --> 58:14.720
You missed one show.

58:14.720 --> 58:15.720
One show.

58:15.720 --> 58:20.040
Alright, anyway, that's it, see you guys next time.

58:20.040 --> 58:23.800
That's the end of another Orange Lounge Radio To Go edition.

58:23.800 --> 58:27.680
This podcast is a proud part of www.orangeloungeradio.com.

58:27.680 --> 58:30.720
See you next update!
