189	2952	Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, week of October 3rd, 2005.
3092	13823	You're tuned in to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your podcast home for all the latest video game news and gamer chat.
14063	17587	Now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.
19389	21691	Hello everybody, once again...
22941	28622	Welcome to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your home for all that news that gamers really want to know about.
28962	30543	Thanks so much for subscribing to us.
30583	32263	We really do appreciate your support.
32723	34603	We are an independent production.
34723	40485	You know, it's just three buddies here doing a show out of a spare bedroom in one of our apartments, really.
41065	43965	So we appreciate you guys supporting just, you know, the independent podcast.
43985	47446	We do this because we love video games, and we never shut up about them.
47666	50167	Isn't that right, Dark Sakura, one of my lovely co-hosts over there?
50707	52047	I don't shut up about anything ever.
53011	53592	This is true.
54052	55353	Video games is one of them though, right?
55553	58035	Yeah, I'd have to say video games are probably up at the top of the list.
58075	59496	That and Serenity.
61598	63559	Loki's here as well, the Techmaster Loki.
63819	64260	Yes, I am.
64300	64840	How are you doing?
65441	66001	I'm good.
66261	67722	And he never shuts up about video games either.
68143	74327	Yeah, and in fact, even the people I work with who we sell video games and they still don't like listening to me.
75188	75929	But you love bacon.
76689	79111	Yes, I have my I Love Bacon shirt on.
79271	79631	Awesome.
80012	80372	Good choice.
80845	81625	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
105031	105971	Okay, well, that's something.
106412	109273	I did go into Bark mode about three times this week, though, with other people.
109573	109813	Right on.
109833	111514	Were you able to get any cool unlocks that way?
111774	112014	No.
112534	122498	However, my friend has an extra fireman's hat and is going to lend it to me, because if you ever have the fireman's hat in your inventory at any time, you will automatically have the Dalmatian, even if you give the hat away.
123198	123758	Interesting.
124058	124338	Okay.
124599	126219	So I'm going to get a Dalmatian next week.
126279	126919	I have to be honest.
126959	128620	I haven't been that into Nintendogs.
129340	130301	It's kind of my interest in fading.
130321	131801	Did your puppies run away?
132081	133262	No, not yet, but they all have fleas.
134172	135193	because I haven't been bathing them.
136074	136214	Ew.
136434	136695	Oh, well.
138076	139277	Loki, what's your game of the week been like?
139677	147065	I tried Lost in Blue a bit for the DS, and that was kind of fun, and then had to play the stupid dogs because otherwise they'll run away.
148146	150488	You know, I'm actually taking two of my copies back.
151049	151589	I don't want them.
152410	154713	The game's not that interesting, and after...
156434	162196	You did kind of make a mistake by buying all three versions, not realizing that all 18... I didn't realize it.
162396	165117	You need to bring your other versions so that I can get your dogs.
166017	166457	I guess.
166517	168278	We'll have to do that before I return them.
169318	173299	Anyway, so other than that, I've been playing DDR Extreme 2, and that was fun.
173639	178461	That's a good dance game, except my dance pads don't work it right now, so I have to play it on the controller.
179181	180141	Boring.
181042	181722	Whatever.
182062	184943	You know, when I was staring at my copy of Graffiti Kingdom this week,
185708	188951	If it makes you feel any better my copy of We Love Katamari is still unwrapped
211704	213125	But you did finally get it.
213145	215426	Yes, I got it the night after the show.
215526	217507	It's not such a touchy subject for you anymore.
217587	218387	No, not as touchy.
218507	220028	It's a very wrapped subject.
220068	221269	I keep it under wraps.
221529	222750	That was awful.
223090	224350	That was really bad.
224891	225271	Boo!
225631	226612	I did it on purpose.
227672	228272	Anything else, Loki?
229753	230754	No, that's really it.
230994	231234	All right.
231904	233805	Um, things that I have been playing this week.
233845	235906	I actually checked out Pack and Roll for the Nintendo DS.
236447	237827	Um, kind of fun.
238088	238668	It's pretty cool.
238748	240649	It's one of those, like, kind of quickie games.
240689	247493	Like, it's a game that I don't think I could really see myself, like, oh, I'm going to sit down for three hours and just have a marathon Pack and Roll session.
247833	254397	It's kind of one of those things where, like, yeah, I could, like, fire this up, play a level while I'm waiting for something else, then just save it and do it again later.
254737	258759	So it's kind of a nice, like, simple, relaxing action game.
259705	263366	I spent at least 30 minutes on it at E3.
263386	263686	Wow.
263966	267007	See, I didn't find it to be quite so addicting.
267047	267748	I mean, it was kind of cool.
267768	269088	It was a really cool concept.
269588	273289	Yes, it kind of whores the stylus features of the DS out, but, you know, it's in a good way.
273329	274590	I guess that's what the stylus is for.
274930	281732	I like the idea that you kind of use Pac-Man as like a trackball, although part of me kind of wonders what that game would be like if you actually had a trackball.
282092	287334	The game would surprisingly be a hell of a lot like Crystal Castles, that old, old Atari game.
287434	288654	It made me think of Marvel Madness.
289456	293483	Marble Madness kind of, I thought, because with the dots and everything, it really reminded me of Crystal Castles.
293783	299212	But instead you were using the stylus to kind of draw your kind of roll with the pen.
299233	299894	So that was kind of neat.
300174	301577	And you do like all these different moves.
303249	306213	It's still kind of only like a borderline recommendation for me, though.
306253	309057	I think if you're a fan of this type of genre, I think you'll get a kick out of this.
309457	315325	But it's also a type of thing that I couldn't see myself playing it for a heck of a long time.
315365	317448	I couldn't see myself playing this game until I beat it.
317488	318509	I think I'd kind of get sick of it.
319010	320152	And the graphics weren't...
321232	325115	The graphics, it looked like a PlayStation game on my DS, which I guess is kind of cool.
325476	326096	But I don't know.
326156	328278	I don't think I really like the graphical style of the game.
328498	329219	It was kind of dumb.
329759	330640	I didn't care for it.
330880	335724	But Pac-Man looked really cute in the little bottom window where he's the controller.
336345	337446	Better than Pac-Pix.
337486	338467	Pac-Pix sucked.
339327	341149	And I got rid of that game quick.
341209	342250	And then I got this game.
342670	343771	And I was just like, eh.
344732	344812	Eh.
346063	374185	so borderline recommendation for pack and roll for me the other game I didn't play this enough I'm not going to make a final judgment on this game I did play a little bit of Lost in Blue it seemed a little I don't know if it's just not my type of game if I'm just not into those point and click games although I don't know for some reason I was like thinking like King's Quest but with the little added like you can actually use the stylus to dig in the sand and kind of explore seemed a little gimmicky to me but I don't
374745	377088	I don't think I played enough of the game to really get a feel for this yet.
377108	380453	I want to give the game another shot, so I'm not going to make a final judgment on it yet, but I did check it out.
381775	382996	I don't know if I'm going to like this one, though.
383056	384759	It just doesn't seem like my kind of game, but we'll see.
385079	386361	I played it for a little bit.
386401	391588	I played it for the first day that you're on the island, and it's like you have to do things really...
393346	397128	in order, otherwise your only player is going to die, because you start off with very little life.
397328	401910	It seemed like it would be really easy to lose in the beginning, a little frustrating, but I don't know.
401990	403231	I'm going to wait and play them a little more.
403291	404272	It was pretty frustrating.
404352	408834	I hear trying to hunt the animals and stuff later on is even more frustrating.
409994	412276	The games are very frustrating.
412296	414117	Oh, and the text boxes were horrible, too.
414317	418979	You only see one line of text at a time, and you have to wait, even though I put my display speed on fast.
419397	421918	I don't like that method of showing text.
421998	425560	So I don't know if I'm going to like this one, guys, but I'm not making a final judgment yet.
425600	426840	There might be something that happens.
427441	430182	There's a lot of games I first play and I don't like them, and then I warm up to them later.
430202	431122	So I'm going to check it out.
431242	433163	A lot of games coming out next month I want for the DS.
433203	434024	Like Trauma Center.
434224	434864	That's going to be fun.
434884	435885	I want to check out Trauma Center as well.
436205	438266	There's something I'm waiting on for the GBA.
438906	439206	What's that?
439346	439786	A whole lot.
440007	441047	Gunstar Superheroes.
441467	441947	Oh, yeah.
441967	442968	That game looks like it's going to be awesome.
443388	445890	One other game I checked out this week was Dance Dance Revolution Extreme 2.
446210	453957	Of course, Orange Launch Radio was started on the music video games and kind of grew beyond that, but I still have a place in my heart for the music video games.
454297	462544	Dance Dance Revolution Extreme 2, if you are a fan of the dancing games in any capacity, you must, I highly recommend Dance Dance Revolution Extreme 2.
463605	470511	I talked about this a lot more on Sunday night's live three-hour show, but I think it really kind of transitioned...
471089	472731	Beatmania 2DX's Drill Mode
484810	485491	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
503356	504257	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
529651	541860	If you're more of a casual fan or if you're curious about DDR, I would recommend you start on Max 2, which was from two years ago, but it had a very solid song list, and I think it was a lot more accessible for people who hadn't really played DDR before.
541880	543581	So that's just my recommendation.
543861	545822	Otherwise, graphics in the game are great.
545862	548484	They gave every song a unique music video this time.
548524	548924	It's great.
549205	550005	The sound, of course.
550426	551406	Kick-butt song list.
551466	555409	Couple of licenses I didn't like, but that's bound to happen when you have such a diverse song list.
556602	558703	and the gameplay, it's DDR.
559483	560164	What else can I say?
560844	562605	Highly recommend if you're a fan of music games.
563665	569167	Kind of borderline if you're not so much, if you just are interested in dance games and want to get into the series.
569407	572729	I have to disagree with most of the music selection though because I wasn't too impressed.
572949	573449	With what you heard?
574437	578340	Yeah, it was a bunch of repetitive, same old trance.
578561	584246	I think when you see what they picked from the old games to put next to it, though, I think it makes it a lot more solid.
584286	587889	They really took a lot of the things the fans have been asking for for years.
588349	592473	Sakura, Daikinkai, Cartoon Heroes, Sync, it's all in there.
592813	597918	So that's kind of nice that Konami really listened to their DDR fans on this one.
599239	599479	Anyway...
602166	606368	I actually did have something that I had forgotten to mention earlier.
607948	612731	Back to the Gunstar Heroes release, there's actually going to be a Sega Ages treasure chest.
613551	615492	I found this on Treasure's homepage.
616372	619614	It's featuring Gunstar Heroes Dynamite Headdy Alien Soldier.
621495	626097	And of course, in the Sega Ages 2500 collection, it'll be sold for 2,500 yen.
626137	628278	And I hope that comes out here.
628709	630852	and also Treasure is doing the Bleach game.
631933	633295	But that's off of the anime.
633776	633956	Hmm.
634236	634456	Okay.
635037	635217	Cool.
636138	637420	If it's Treasure, it's gotta be good.
637460	640504	You know, I actually liked the Sega collection they put out.
640544	646672	A lot of people really panned it and said it was awful, and I guess that's probably because of the Golden Axe remake, but I thought it was a good deal.
647076	649377	I thought it was better than that Namco collection that just came out.
649537	656101	I thought the Sega one was way better, but... I didn't buy it because we've already, so far, have some of the Sega Ages games we went to since we imported them.
656761	659282	Have any of you guys picked up the Midway Arcade Treasures 3 yet?
659342	659502	Not 3.
660203	664585	I'm definitely interested because it has... I didn't even realize this game was in it, but it has Iron Man's off-road in it.
664885	669487	That was, like, my favorite racing game, which is kind of not even really, like, it's borderline racing.
670228	671208	But yeah, I want to check that out.
671548	672449	I've heard good things about it.
673029	674050	I'll tell you what broke my heart.
674350	674510	Hmm.
675843	686752	Our landlord, who's actually good friends of ours, cleaned out some stuff out of their attic in the garage and brought down an Atari 2600 wood grain that had cobwebs all over it.
686772	690535	It made my heart break to have a box full of games.
690595	692417	I was like, no!
692817	695880	Except it was like that slow motion, no!
697781	699363	Loki got me thinking about racing games.
699443	700964	Did you hear about What's Coming to America?
700984	701064	Yeah.
701533	702394	Mario Kart GP 64DD Collection
725563	726164	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
746518	753803	and the first thing is we're going to give away a copy of the DDR Extreme 2 V-Rare as well as a copy of the Max 2 V-Rare.
753883	758947	We gave one away on the live show last week and we told you guys on the podcast you had a chance to enter this week.
759367	765071	Many of you did, so DarkSakura, pull a number out of the hat and let's see who's going to win the copy of the V-Rares.
765291	766552	Remember guys, these aren't...
766992	769053	Games, they're the VRares, the soundtracks.
769333	771375	Some folks in their email subject said, I want to win the games.
771615	773536	Sorry, guys, it's just the soundtracks.
773596	774636	We don't have that big a budget yet.
774997	776477	All right, who are we giving it to?
776517	776998	What's the number?
777198	778118	Number 28.
778338	778999	Number 28.
779599	780520	Okay, let's see.
780700	781700	It's 15.
782261	783361	This will be number 30.
783481	784842	This is 28 right here.
785042	795028	Our winner is Joseph E. Joseph E is the winner of the other soundtracks we're going to give away there.
796042	803107	his email address says red star in it so I'm guessing that's his handle there so congratulations to you you've won the other soundtracks good job
805729	808952	Also, what we're going to give away, we're going to give away... Now, this is a game that we're giving away.
808972	812915	We're giving away a copy of In the Groove, and this is another dance game that's out.
812975	814256	We have a lot of dance games to give away.
814276	816517	Are we going to give away some non-dance games in the coming weeks, Loki?
816698	816858	Yes.
816998	817358	Yes, we are.
817458	818959	Okay.
819099	821701	Obviously, we love dance games, but we've got to give away some other stuff, too.
822002	828046	Anyway, this is a copy of In the Groove that has been autographed, quote-unquote, by all the hosts here at Orange Lounge Radio.
828547	834391	And what you had to do was write a haiku about In the Groove, and it had to be five syllables, seven syllables...
836025	839046	3 syllables, not 575, because that's a horrible inside joke.
839926	841386	And Loki is going to sweeten the deal.
841426	842867	You're throwing in something else, aren't you?
843207	849008	I'm throwing in a t-shirt that says, In the Courtroom, but it's in the style of the logo for In the Groove.
849528	850009	Very nice.
850449	852629	Because, you know, they got sued by Konami.
852749	855650	You're going to throw in something that says, In the Courtroom.
855690	855950	Lovely.
856990	863472	And then we're also going to give away to all of our winners, not just the folks who won the In the Groove,
864072	869624	we have some Silent Hill 3 stickers that were given to us by somebody at Konami so we're going to give
870391	870711	SILENT HILL 3
898726	901268	Minds, Mods, and much more.
901868	905591	In the Groove will help you score, just not dates.
906231	907012	That was brilliant.
907212	907772	That was great.
907792	908473	That's our runner-up.
908493	909293	It actually had a rhyme in it.
909473	909974	Yeah, it's good.
910154	912535	That's our runner-up, AsianBuddyPaul.
912656	913856	AsianBuddyPaul is our runner-up.
914016	915097	Congratulations.
915277	916598	And here is our winner.
917939	919520	You want a haiku?
920341	921922	Maybe about In the Groove?
922739	924061	They got sued.
924501	925402	That was the best.
925483	930148	That was Justin M is our winner of the In the Groove contest.
930188	930949	Congratulations.
931009	931570	Yay.
932171	932471	All right.
932832	933352	Good job, guys.
933412	934494	We did get lots of good ones.
934654	935515	We did get lots of good ones.
935535	936656	You guys crack us up.
936716	937197	So good job.
937738	939580	We have to do more creativity competitions.
939800	940241	Absolutely.
940919	942000	The Xbox Chief Officer, Robbie Bach
958127	981115	Expects half of all Xbox 360 owners to be on Xbox Live In the article it goes on to say that only about 10% of current Xbox users Which would be about 2 million people Use the current version of Xbox Live But because they're going to have this free silver version of Xbox Live That's going to be on the 360 The chief officer there believes that 50%
982435	983095	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1012708	1015429	Because what, Silver, we did this a few weeks back.
1015449	1016909	We were talking about the differences between Silver and Gold.
1016929	1021310	Silver just basically got you on there and you could communicate with people, but you couldn't really play them, right?
1021390	1022550	You have to go to Gold for that.
1022570	1023230	That would be correct.
1023330	1028912	So if they end up saying that 70% of the people are on Xbox Live, well, does that mean 70% of the people are playing games on there?
1029772	1030112	No.
1030332	1030892	So I don't know.
1031292	1032432	I don't know how much weight this story holds.
1032452	1033273	It's just huge numbers, that's all.
1033373	1039054	I was kind of surprised this story got as much attention as it did because I'm like, so if it's free, yeah, people are going to use it.
1039194	1039454	I don't know.
1040107	1042309	I think that wins the award of the evening.
1042429	1042770	We'll see.
1043210	1043530	We'll see.
1044651	1047834	DarkSakura, you actually had a story about the Xbox 360's launch as well, didn't you?
1048134	1054860	Actually, I got an email from one of our listeners, one of our regular writers as well.
1054960	1055581	All right, right on.
1055641	1056762	From Rob with two B's.
1059144	1065309	I'm just going to go ahead and read this email real quick just because I think it's very well written and brings up a good point.
1066871	1071058	It's been hitting the internet gaming news about Microsoft rejecting the Blu-ray DVD format.
1071159	1074104	I'm not really interested in the reasons, but rather why it's an issue at all.
1074585	1076188	So maybe the crew can help me with that.
1076448	1078853	And I actually thought it would be a good thing to bring up for discussion.
1080077	1084300	Unless you have three hours of video, why would one DVD be insufficient for a game?
1084660	1090565	The reason I ask myself this is, how can there be so much code and support files to engulf an entire DVD?
1091005	1102954	The compiled code itself should be a fraction of the entire content, but I've noticed that games of practically the same complexity as Tetris are three megabytes and higher.
1103414	1107137	This can only mean developer kits, uncompressed files, and non-optimized code.
1107737	1108258	Thanks for watching!
1125951	1131876	All of that accepted, it still has to be unnecessarily large support files that really push them over the edge.
1132416	1137540	Overly large and or detailed bitmaps compressed along with the code instead of as bitmaps.
1138301	1139582	The same with video and sound.
1139662	1143044	It may not use more of the file-specific compression algorithms.
1143485	1147988	It brings me to the conclusion that if the file fills more than a DVD, you may want to reconsider your content.
1148448	1151631	Make sure that you're not adding fluff to distract the player from the core game.
1152011	1152612	It is absolutely
1153512	1155473	from the core game is absolutely piece of crap.
1155994	1158135	Almost every movie license game fits this description.
1159095	1159596	Interesting.
1160396	1168961	You know, my initial thought as to why you would need so much space, though, is that isn't the Xbox 3, if I'm not mistaken, isn't Microsoft forcing all the Xbox 360 games to be high-def compatible?
1169701	1170662	I believe so.
1170742	1171702	Which I think is a good thing.
1172203	1173023	Nintendo, are you listening?
1174584	1177746	And that would take up more space by default, I would think.
1177766	1179306	I don't think it would take up a full DVD.
1179346	1180107	Well, I think it's...
1180706	1185127	The thing is, when you're pushing these higher-res games, you're going to have higher-res textures.
1185487	1189148	More of them, if you've seen Project Gotham Racing, the whole buildings are textured.
1189708	1190788	Of course, it takes up more space.
1190868	1193008	It's not coding that's going to take up space at all.
1193048	1194608	Coding is tiny.
1195389	1198689	It's basically all these textures and audio and stuff that you've got.
1198709	1204350	I don't even know how many channels of audio you've got on the 360 and stuff, 5.1 and everything.
1204730	1207791	It's the difference between why a DVD video file is 4GB
1209378	1211798	and a DivX file is only 600 megs.
1212099	1215539	That's, in quality, you're going to see a big difference there, too.
1215979	1223601	And Blu-ray, well, the only reason they're not going Blu-ray is because Sony's the one that's making Blu-ray, so, duh, they're not going to support their competitor.
1224921	1226441	I agree, though, with what's being said about it.
1226481	1228282	It really comes down to the quality of games.
1228562	1236103	You know, there's going to be those crap games that don't make good use of the space, but I really think there will be games out there that are just going to have some stunning...
1236584	1242529	Cutscenes and things that could take up feasibly more room than a normal DVD could handle.
1243549	1250775	I don't know if there'll be any launch titles, but I think down the line, if there's that room for expansion, naturally the games have to grow.
1251349	1252130	Thanks for watching!
1272558	1278302	They will have to use the hard drive, but as we know, developers can't assume the hard drive will always be there for the 360.
1279283	1284066	So his question is, do you see this as a growing trend where we're going to see more eye candy and less gameplay?
1287731	1290212	I think unfortunately that's kind of... It's happening already.
1290232	1291752	I think it's been a trend that's been happening already.
1292233	1292693	Absolutely.
1292733	1298955	I think there's games... But you know, sometimes there's games out there that have a lot of good eye candy, but they have good gameplay too, like Xenosaga comes to mind.
1298995	1303377	I mean, God, that game was like half just sit and watch the cutscenes, but it was still a good game.
1306332	1310013	But I think, you know, and I think the other person who emailed, was that Rob?
1310213	1310674	Yeah.
1311014	1316076	I think what he said there about the movie franchise games are some of the biggest culprits of that stuff.
1316156	1318056	Not always, but usually the biggest culprits of that stuff.
1318376	1319737	I think he made an excellent point with that.
1319777	1325339	I think, yeah, those games have always been about the eye candy a lot of times and making you remember the movie and things.
1326805	1328425	I think it's kind of a trend that's going on already.
1329046	1331466	And it'll just continue to go.
1331646	1339068	I honestly think that that was the big thing that spawned the whole PlayStation is better than Saturn bullshit of a few years ago.
1339808	1345409	The thing is, though, is that most of the people that were saying that never imported a single Saturn game.
1345609	1347109	And were not 2D gamers.
1347649	1349430	I think this goes all the way back to Super Nintendo.
1349450	1351150	Remember those games that would whore Mode 7?
1351630	1351970	Yeah.
1352250	1353971	And there was really nothing else to it.
1354011	1355371	It was just, oh, look at the pretty Mode 7.
1357049	1363719	But then again, the Super Nintendo, they were one of the first systems to do polygons.
1364400	1368026	Although actually there was a system out before that that did it, but not in America.
1368996	1374598	The PC Engine Duo had a game called Sapphire that was one of their arcade card games.
1375779	1380361	That system was so intelligent to have those upgradable cards to support the different games.
1380961	1383062	But I've played this game.
1383422	1386523	It's got really pretty graphics in it for its time.
1387243	1389204	And in-game polygons.
1389224	1390945	And there were some great Mode 7 games.
1390965	1393026	Pilotwings I loved and some of the other older ones.
1393046	1394126	We had Star Fox.
1394306	1395507	I mean, even effects in...
1396520	1402082	and, um, like Dracula X. But see, you had the Star Fox game, but then there was some buggy racing game or something that was stupid.
1402122	1402602	I didn't like it.
1402682	1404203	It was Step Race FX.
1404423	1405043	Step Race FX.
1405063	1407284	Yeah, that was, I didn't like that.
1407444	1412126	But, um, but, uh, the, uh, some of the other, F-Zero.
1412726	1412906	Sure.
1413838	1414599	F-Zero was mid-seven.
1414739	1414939	All right.
1415039	1415820	We've got to move on, though.
1416260	1420383	So if you want to email us, send us an email at togo at orangeloungeradio.com.
1420403	1421864	We'll get to some more emails a little later in the show.
1421924	1422084	Yes?
1422224	1422444	All right.
1422944	1425546	Loki, you had a story about, now, the Xbox 360.
1425586	1429148	There was some type of teaser site going on, and the countdown finished this week.
1429289	1430609	What happened?
1431830	1433992	OriginXbox360.com.
1435192	1440336	It would have been great if you live in the UK, because guess what?
1440496	1441637	It's a UK launch site.
1441737	1441857	It's
1442867	1452891	You basically, you can enter to win a trip to the launch party that's in, I guess, Vegas, if I remember correctly, or New York, in the United States.
1453011	1455072	But you have to be in the UK in order to enter this.
1455693	1461215	Basically, the website was teasing it with some cut-out pictures of rabbits and this giant tree that was growing.
1462195	1467077	And at the very end, you have these rabbits, and the whole thing reminds me of Monty Python, the way it's done.
1467317	1468478	Basically, the rabbits, you know,
1468925	1473747	One of them eats the fruit that makes them hallucinate, and then you go to the maiden site.
1474207	1475347	It was a complete letdown.
1475407	1480709	We were thinking it was going to be something cool, but unless you were in the UK, it was not.
1481429	1483470	But we do have listeners in the UK, so hey.
1483610	1484670	Hey, good for you guys.
1484690	1485430	Congratulations.
1485650	1486430	It's a great site.
1486450	1486731	It's cute.
1486791	1490352	It has rabbits that talk, and they're little bunny things.
1491392	1493593	I love bunnies, and then ten bunnies would be good.
1493873	1497134	The problem is they multiply too fast.
1499605	1500225	Yeah, I don't know.
1500325	1501666	It was a really cool site.
1502506	1504807	Unfortunately, it's only for the UK.
1504827	1506507	The punchline sucked, in other words.
1507007	1516650	It was really dumb, because the whole thing... If you have a launch site like this, and you're basically making it seem like, oh, the world's connected... Except for you people in the US.
1516790	1518631	You're not connected to the world, so...
1519417	1520218	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1542737	1546380	DarkSakura wants to let you guys know what's going on for the release calendar in Europe.
1546560	1548422	We have a number of games coming out this week.
1549122	1556788	Black and White 2 for the PC, Armored Core Nexus, Geist, King of Fighters 2003 for Xbox.
1556989	1557769	That's been out for a while.
1558590	1559170	Here, yeah.
1559210	1562913	Yeah, Nintendogs is coming out in the UK on the 7th.
1563634	1568718	Shattered Union, Stargate 1, SG-1, which I actually really want to play.
1569819	1572001	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas, The Pumpkin King.
1573739	1577641	Also on the 14th coming out, we've got Driver for the GBA.
1578321	1578761	Stay away.
1578861	1580582	Driver 3 for the GBA.
1580602	1581542	Yeah, Driver 3, sorry.
1582682	1590025	Marvel Nemesis Rise of the Imperfects, Namco Museum Battle Collection, Rengoku Tower of Purgatory, Serious Sam 2.
1590785	1592086	Those are some of the ones coming out.
1593066	1598828	And also, I don't know why it took so long, but they're also on the 21st getting Dragon Ball Z, Budokai Tengaiichi.
1599697	1602198	Actually, Budokai Tenkaichi hasn't come out yet.
1602338	1604559	It's not coming out until November.
1605060	1608281	According to Eurogamer, their release is October 21st for the UK.
1608481	1608882	Lucky them.
1609042	1612343	Yeah, because November it's not coming out until, I think, second or third week.
1612503	1612964	It's a good thing.
1612984	1613344	Oh, wait, no, wait.
1613684	1614044	No, I'm sorry.
1614064	1614844	That was October.
1615325	1616345	We're getting it a week later, though.
1617025	1621508	It's a good thing I could care less about Dragon Ball Z. Genji is also coming out, which is actually a game that I have at home.
1621808	1623228	And we did bring a pack and roll earlier.
1623268	1623869	They get it on the 28th.
1625169	1626690	Zenoseca Episode 2, also on the 28th.
1626850	1630393	If you know a place that rents DS games, seriously, rent before you buy on that one.
1630734	1632815	I think it's one of those ones you'll love it or you'll not.
1634016	1634557	All right, thank you.
1635257	1635578	You're welcome.
1635598	1635738	Cool.
1636598	1645966	Let's move on to, I've got to ask Loki, you know, kind of our hack and crack guy, you know, I don't follow the hack scene so much, but obviously I heard the big news about the 2.0 downgrade.
1646206	1646686	What happened?
1647427	1653472	Okay, so the people that, you know, found that bug to begin with in the 2.0 downgrade
1654640	1659002	Firmware basically be able to launch their own code by doing a buffer overflow.
1660463	1664884	They basically created this program to make the PSP think that's version 1.0.
1665685	1671787	And so when you do that, then you can run the version 1.5 update and basically downgrade your entire PSP.
1672348	1675069	So this method has been posted all over the place.
1675629	1680031	I think it started off at PSPHacks.com is where they originally posted it.
1680451	1680591	And
1704865	1705867	Unless you know where to get them.
1705888	1706489	Not exactly.
1706529	1709896	If you're the one that's in the homebrew site, they do have links to the firmware.
1709936	1713043	They do keep copies on their servers for the Japanese and stuff, so...
1713436	1715517	Not surprised Sony's ticked off about this.
1715877	1718658	Although, you'd think they'd embrace the homebrew thing a little more.
1718718	1720519	No, you'd think they'd take advantage of it.
1720579	1722360	They'd take advantage of it, at least, you know.
1722480	1722840	I don't know.
1723080	1728603	I was telling my guy that represents H-Tech, I'm like, why aren't they coming out with RPG Maker for the PSP?
1728643	1730124	I'm like, it'd be freaking sweet.
1730144	1731864	You could put your own textures and stuff in there.
1731884	1733425	You can distribute your games online.
1733885	1735026	It's homebrew, but it's legal.
1736146	1737227	I mean, what more would you want?
1737467	1742289	I always found it interesting that in the 2.0 upgrade, there were things like
1742591	1747354	Remember there was the hack a few months ago before 2.0 came out that would allow you to change the background on your PSP?
1747734	1749355	And then they implemented that in 2.0.
1749475	1750976	I thought that was kind of interesting.
1751216	1753318	Yeah, there's stuff like that.
1753738	1754778	But that's the thing, though.
1754798	1762163	The other reason is people are only really upgrading to use the web browser, but when you think about it, the web browser is kind of useless anyways.
1763364	1765265	Unless, I mean, you just... I don't know.
1765305	1767226	There's not a lot of sites that support it right now, so...
1768556	1778204	and it doesn't support Flash and it's really limited on, it doesn't support Java so it's like, they're teething oh well maybe future firmware updates will implement that.
1778224	1780706	Well thank you for releasing something crippled for us.
1780746	1781187	Thank you.
1781587	1782268	Appreciate it.
1782748	1785210	A good way for them to cover their tracks when this kind of stuff comes up though.
1785851	1795839	But the whole thing is they're working with Homebrew on even the 2.0 and if they get smart enough they're going to figure out how to just rip stuff out of the different updates and put
1796580	1798161	That's what's going to happen.
1798181	1802362	And speaking of updates, I have to warn a few people here.
1802982	1817886	There was something going around, actually, that was basically saying it's a patcher that will fix your PSP to, I think, add the browser in there as well.
1818246	1820487	And it's basically this patcher that's been going around.
1820507	1823848	I don't know who was releasing it, PSP Team.
1825461	1828982	and it will actually crash your PSP and destroy it.
1829122	1833023	Oh, it's got to be somebody that wants to mess it up for everybody else.
1833064	1833584	So, yeah.
1833764	1838045	So don't download that, but do find the big links for it.
1838665	1839085	It's out there.
1839485	1839786	All right.
1840026	1847988	Now, speaking of the PSP, we here at Orange Lounge Radio have a pretty hefty announcement, and I think it's time to mention what it is.
1848148	1851089	Loki, what is going on, Orange Lounge Radio PSP-wise?
1851496	1860980	Well, everybody's having the PSP, and those people that do have the 2.0 browser or a web browser out there that they're using on the PSP are looking for more portals and links and stuff like that.
1861620	1874606	So we here at Orange Launch Radio decided it's time to get with things, and we like to be innovative and jumped on the whole podcasting thing right when it was kind of getting started here.
1875487	1878968	So now we actually will be announcing the launch of OLRPSP.com
1881916	1883979	which will be our PSP formatted site.
1883999	1888063	You're going to find links to download our podcast straight to your PSP.
1888103	1892608	We're going to have downloads just like we have a wallpaper on there now that you can download for it.
1893375	1898678	and plus you'll be able to keep up with the news that we have and a lot of other things, just more features.
1899138	1901239	So that's olrpsp.com.
1901279	1910484	Now you can visit this on a PC, on your regular Internet Explorer or Firefly, but it's going to look kind of crappy because this site is formatted for your PSP.
1910524	1912365	This is specifically for those folks.
1913525	1920949	Actually, it looks kind of okay on a... It's okay, but if you're wondering why it looks all funky, it's because it's specifically for a PSP.
1922108	1923769	That looks pretty good if you have a high-definition screen.
1923989	1924270	Oh, yeah.
1924490	1924710	Oh, yeah.
1924830	1926592	Yeah, it looks really nice.
1927512	1936239	Loki and VXJasonXV, our tech guy behind the scenes, you guys did an incredible job on this, and I think people are going to love it because I love the way you guys designed the site.
1936259	1941383	You used a lot of image maps in your design, and I think that's a great way to browse on the PSP.
1941443	1943105	So check it out, guys.
1943205	1951151	And I've got my 2.0 PSP that I was actually testing it with right as I'm making it, so make sure that everything worked, that it looked nice.
1952029	1953269	And it just works awesome.
1953309	1956530	And the first wallpaper we have, I have it on my PSP.
1956550	1957250	It looks nice.
1957310	1960431	It doesn't detract from the icon so you can see everything.
1960971	1962711	And ironically enough, it worked out that way.
1962771	1964612	But it's just really cool.
1964672	1967532	All right, so check that out, olrpsp.com.
1967552	1970393	No www, remember, folks, because otherwise that won't work.
1970873	1971153	Really?
1971353	1973954	Yeah, just olrpsp.com.
1974074	1974934	All right, check that out.
1975598	1977199	Alright, moving on.
1977299	1978499	Let's go to another story here.
1978519	1980239	I have a story about Disgaea 2.
1980520	1982680	A lot of folks are really into the Disgaea.
1983941	1984681	Cute story.
1985101	1988162	It had a very cute story to it and a very interesting game there.
1989102	1994024	Disgaea 2 has been announced in the latest issue of Dengeki PS2.
1994784	1995444	It's going to be out for 2006.
1998245	2005087	So that is going to be what is coming out and the Etna, Devil Girl Etna
2005823	2011105	and the Prinies, the little penguin guys, they will be coming back in the next Disgaea as well.
2012085	2022869	Some cameos as well of characters from Makai Kingdom, which was another game in that same series, I believe, or at least from the same developer.
2022909	2023749	Yeah, it's the same series.
2026010	2026350	What game?
2027170	2027970	Not La Pucelle.
2028090	2028851	It was a different game.
2029391	2030511	No, Makai Tenshou?
2030571	2031792	Yeah, Makai Kingdom.
2032312	2032972	Here, yeah.
2033860	2034880	So check that out there.
2034980	2038801	It's going to be a very similar game with the combo system and everything is coming back.
2038881	2039961	So that's Disgaea 2.
2042302	2044943	Let's go on to, I think what we should do now.
2045303	2048524	We've talked an awful lot about a lot of games so far, haven't we?
2049024	2049364	Yeah.
2049404	2054065	So I think what we need to do, we need to talk about some real life things.
2054405	2062707	And, you know, we here at Orange Lounge Radio, we can't play video games all day long because if we played video games all day long, we'd have no time to design websites.
2063715	2071776	So, DarkSakura is here to remind you guys there's a whole world out there, and she would like to give you some advice to help you survive in the world.
2071816	2075437	So, DarkSakura, what are you going to talk to the kids about tonight?
2076457	2079258	Today's bit of advice is how to survive a bird attack.
2080638	2081658	Like in the Hitchcock movie?
2081698	2082118	Yeah.
2082158	2082418	Okay.
2083378	2086279	There's even, I even have a picture that looks like it's from the birds.
2086979	2089460	Number one, watch for hovering and clacking.
2089640	2091740	If you observe this behavior, be ready for an attack.
2092429	2094170	Don't wander on to the set of Hitchcock remakes.
2121969	2123049	And also they're birds.
2123149	2123870	I mean, come on.
2123890	2125450	You should be able to fight off birds.
2125530	2126330	They're small.
2126370	2129131	When they say don't feed the pigeons, they effing mean it.
2129171	2130132	It's a bird.
2130172	2133113	It's not like a giant duck or goose or something.
2133173	2136854	I mean, if you have like a flock of geese or something that are... A flock of seagulls.
2137574	2139555	Or a flock of... Well, seagulls are just pathetic.
2139595	2142255	I mean, they'll drop dead when you give them, you know, Alka-Seltzer.
2142275	2144136	But seriously, I mean, they're birds.
2144216	2145456	I mean, you should be able to fight off birds.
2145476	2147537	I was attacked by a flock of seagulls once, and you know what?
2148117	2148517	I ran.
2148978	2150218	I ran so far away.
2150238	2150438	Hey.
2151963	2153004	Did it give you bad hair?
2153224	2160490	Loki, you've got a story about the Nintendo Wi-Fi DS system that's coming up, and I'm really excited about this.
2160610	2163712	I am so excited about the DS Wi-Fi.
2163812	2170117	I hope this isn't just one of those things that's a good theory on paper, but I really hope Nintendo doesn't let me down on this.
2170137	2171358	But this is going to be bigger than I thought.
2171458	2175801	I thought this was just going to be Animal Crossing and Mario Kart, but not the case.
2176242	2178103	No, they have a lot of things announced for it, actually.
2178844	2181686	The Nintendo Wi-Fi site actually launched
2182731	2184891	By launch, they mean there's a teaser page there now.
2185712	2199874	So basically, if you go to NintendoWiFi.com and you check it out, their wonderful logo for it, the games that they're saying that are going to be utilizing the Wi-Fi, they have a huge list here.
2200434	2201474	This is only partial, too.
2201714	2208255	It's, of course, Animal Crossing, Bomberman, which I was surprised, and I'm assuming that's the Bomberman that came out already.
2208915	2209616	Maybe there's another one.
2209656	2209956	I don't know.
2209976	2210796	There might be another one.
2210816	2211976	I haven't heard of one, but
2212869	2217753	Castlevania at DS, which that's coming out in a couple of days here.
2218954	2223698	We have Contact, which I hope is not a game based on the really crappy movie.
2223758	2224538	I somehow doubt it.
2225479	2229482	Digimon World, of course, they'll probably make a DS version.
2230743	2234526	Dynasty Warriors DS, which I heard was actually pushed back to who knows when.
2235247	2236027	Some really good ones.
2236427	2238929	Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles DS, which is pretty cool.
2238989	2240250	I hope that's playable.
2240350	2241391	That would be great.
2242711	2244472	Mario Kart DS, of course, no surprise.
2244532	2246933	Metroid Prime Hunters, which isn't even coming out until next year.
2248714	2249594	Let's see here.
2250034	2252956	Super Monkey Ball DS, which whoop-a-dee-doo.
2253576	2260560	Tony Hawk's American Skateland, which is the DS version of American Wasteland, but they did their own specific version for it.
2260900	2263641	Top Spin 2, Tenchu DS.
2264481	2267023	Then they have some generic card games.
2267043	2269524	They have Ultimate Card Games and Ultimate Brain Games.
2269624	2271105	And then World Soccer Winnie-11 DS.
2273002	2278505	For the record, Contact is by Goichi Suda, who is the director of Capcom's Killer7.
2279606	2280546	Oh, it's that game.
2281407	2283128	That's weird.
2283168	2284228	So it shouldn't suck.
2285029	2285229	Good.
2286089	2286789	No Jodie Foster.
2287050	2291212	This isn't launching until November, but hey, that's when Mario Kart's coming out.
2291232	2291852	That's pretty exciting.
2291892	2293753	What's the website for that, the teaser site?
2293893	2294674	Nintendo.com?
2294694	2295634	NintendoWiFi.com.
2295674	2296695	NintendoWiFi.com.
2296955	2297275	Check it out.
2298328	2299269	Grandma's Boy
2314097	2316098	Oh, okay, yeah, yeah, Grandma's Boy was the one I had.
2316138	2317779	I didn't even realize the trailer was out already.
2318499	2321221	It is a brand new Adam Sandler movie that's coming out now.
2321301	2324122	Why would we care here on a video game show about an Adam Sandler movie?
2324462	2330385	Because in the film, Grandma's Boy, he plays a 36-year-old game tester and aspiring developer.
2331486	2335528	And it's about, oh, it's about Adam Sandler stuff, you know.
2336048	2336608	It's funny.
2336748	2338049	It's got the mom from...
2338942	2340283	Everybody Loves Raymond in it.
2369938	2370679	Well, here's another one.
2370699	2373361	This is a little more serious of a game adaptation.
2374061	2380185	Siren is going to be made into a live action film in Japan.
2381065	2391071	And let's see, the film is going to be directed by Sada Yoshihiko, who made Trick and Kizoku.
2391612	2392392	I hope I pronounced that right.
2393092	2398976	He's writing a treatment right now that's supposed to come out about February 11th when Siren 2 comes out as well.
2399777	2403799	So it is being plotted right now to come out, a Siren video game.
2404100	2407902	Another franchise is getting their own movie pretty soon.
2409162	2411584	God of War is being worked on right now.
2411704	2412845	That's not a surprise.
2413205	2418228	Adaptation, but you know they're going to cast Vin Diesel or The Rock for it.
2418768	2425031	You know what I saw finally on the big screen for the first time was that trailer for Doom, which I hadn't seen yet.
2425171	2425372	Yeah.
2425572	2425912	Yeah.
2427133	2430216	I'm sorry, that first person thing, look hokey.
2430896	2432998	They're going to use that way too much.
2433098	2439462	I mean, I can understand, let's do that sequence for like maybe 30 seconds of the movies to kind of throw back to the, you know.
2439482	2441124	Yeah, you know what that reminds me of?
2441444	2447388	It reminds me of, what was the, not House of the Dead, I think it was, where they had the gun.
2447408	2449409	Is that what it is?
2449470	2453172	House of the Dead, yeah, where they threw in actual shots from the game.
2453212	2454533	Worst zombie movie ever.
2454553	2455454	Yeah, thank you.
2457025	2458666	Did you hear about the PlayStation?
2459446	2459626	What?
2459646	2460427	What's going on with the PlayStation?
2460587	2461227	They won an Emmy.
2461567	2462108	An Emmy?
2462328	2462608	Yep.
2462908	2465369	Was it one of those things that Ellen gave out on the awards?
2465389	2466790	Because I don't remember hearing about that.
2467510	2474313	Ten years to the day after the original PlayStation went on sale in North America, the console has been awarded an Emmy for...
2475120	2478741	Outstanding Achievement in Technology and Advanced New Media.
2479881	2482622	So that must have been at one of those tech awards.
2482642	2485442	You know how they always do the tech awards that aren't good enough for TV?
2485582	2487403	Like the Oscars and the Emmys do that?
2487723	2491123	Yeah, the 57th Annual Technology and Engineering Emmy Awards.
2492084	2493504	That's not all that they've won.
2494304	2495124	What else did they win?
2495444	2499605	They've won... Banishment from the Vatican.
2500705	2502066	I don't know if I'd consider that winning.
2502386	2503386	No, but basically...
2504423	2513306	Sony Italy has recently put up a full-page advertisement depicting some guy wearing a crown of thorns, much like Jesus.
2514026	2517207	Except this guy has no beard and no mustache, right?
2517227	2520709	Except this guy looks like he's a, I don't know, some... A nerd?
2520989	2522649	Some, yeah, nerd reject or whatever.
2522669	2530352	Anyways, and he has a crown of thorns made up of the PlayStation symbols, you know, the X, circle, square, triangle stuff, and
2531151	2536772	And then the subtitle to the whole article, which I love this, Ten Years of Passion.
2538413	2539453	Oh my gosh.
2540373	2540813	Wow.
2542214	2543594	How did that get by?
2543614	2545755	I don't think it did.
2546315	2547775	The Vatican took exception.
2549856	2551676	How did that get by at Sony, though?
2551696	2554737	So is the entirety of Sega Corporate X communicated now?
2554877	2555217	Wow.
2555517	2558698	Yeah, they've actually had it pulled out of the Vatican.
2558738	2559138	You think?
2559622	2561483	They executed their Vatican powers.
2561803	2562184	All right.
2563805	2564405	Moving on.
2564465	2567287	We promised earlier in the show we'd get to some more of your e-mails.
2567507	2572750	So if you have an e-mail for us, you can always send us one at togo, T-O-G-O, at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
2573331	2578494	And DarkSakura is going to rip open the mailbag violently and salvage some letters to read on air.
2578514	2581156	Smash, smash, rip, tear.
2581196	2583477	16Bit sent us an e-mail, actually.
2583717	2584218	Awesome name.
2585158	2589041	A correction about Panorama Cotton stating that it's just fairly uncommon.
2589944	2591104	and there were several thousand.
2591145	2595766	I tend to exaggerate with that game because I've had no luck finding a copy for less than $500.
2595966	2598947	I'm impressed somebody out there actually knew what the game was.
2599027	2600008	I sure as hell never heard of it.
2600068	2601368	Panorama Cotton is fun.
2601428	2602029	I never heard of it.
2602289	2605190	Although it actually does give me sort of motion sickness.
2606190	2610952	And Rainbow Cotton didn't, which is really weird because usually it has to be the 3D game that makes me motion sick.
2612207	2616071	While we're on the subject of corrections, I actually have to correct something too, because I got an email about that.
2617072	2617332	I know.
2617692	2627261	DJ Ranma S wants to know that the Miyamoto meet, which we talked about last week, the article that I was referencing talked about that it was going to be the first ten people.
2628019	2630200	would get to do Bark Mode with Miyamoto's dog.
2630520	2646904	But unfortunately, if you think about the way Bark Mode works, there's no way you can restrict that to just being the first ten people in line that are going to be able to do it, because Bark Mode is going to pick up on any DS that's within 100 feet, so really it ended up being anybody that could get to Miyamoto's dog got to do Bark Mode with Miyamoto's dog.
2647385	2653026	And so a lot of people outside actually ended up getting Miyamoto on their friends list, which I think is just awesome.
2653486	2655787	Thank you, DJ Ranma S, for sending in that correction.
2657281	2662944	Also, one of our Canadian friends, Aceman, sent a question.
2663524	2669267	Said, I'm thinking about getting the 360 when it comes out on launch, but the thing is I don't know about the game selection.
2670087	2673809	Like, I know which ones I'm going to get for myself, Gears of War and Dead Rising.
2673829	2680232	My question is, are there any four-player co-op games offline that you guys know of that I should pick up other than Ghost Recon?
2681641	2688704	First off, I'd like to mention you might think of some better games to pick because Dead Rising and Gears of War are not coming out of launch, unfortunately.
2688864	2689465	Oh, ouch.
2689845	2692706	Yeah, Gears of War is to be announced right now.
2692746	2695007	Dead Rising has never even been on launch.
2696608	2699249	However, you've got a good selection of sports games.
2699309	2704191	If you're a sports fan, you have the entire 2K series and the EA series, you know, their games.
2704551	2708352	If I may, I actually have the full list of launch titles in alphabetical order.
2708653	2709293	All right, go for it.
2709998	2713459	Amped 3, Call of Duty, Condemned, which is Sega.
2713479	2714280	I'm looking forward to that.
2714740	2721722	Dead or Alive 4, Elder Scrolls 4, Final Fantasy XI, Full Auto.
2721902	2723343	Oh, Final Fantasy XI is a launch title?
2723383	2724583	They are not launch titles.
2724603	2725643	That list is wrong.
2725663	2725803	Okay.
2726084	2729545	Well, I'm still going to read the list because these are either launch or near launch.
2730745	2737287	Full Auto, Ghost Recon, Advanced Warfighter, Gun, Cameo, Elements of Power, Madden NFL is...
2739424	2753205	NBA 2K6, NHL 2K6, blah blah The Outfit, Perfect Dark, Project Gotham Racing 3, Quake 4, Ridge Racer 6 Saints Row, Tony Hawk's American Wasteland, Top Spin 2
2754629	2759514	Second wave of launch titles announced by EB as of November 16th.
2759874	2765059	Burnout Revenge, FIFA Soccer 06, Peter Jackson's King Kong.
2765540	2772746	By the way, speaking of that, they showed a scene of King Kong to the GameStop managers and it apparently is supposed to be very awesome.
2773828	2777911	NBA Live 06, Need for Speed Most Wanted, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 06.
2779752	2781093	Perfect Dark, isn't that a four-player?
2781333	2783313	Let me correct that list real quick here.
2783353	2788574	King Kong is coming day and date with the PlayStation 2, Xbox versions, and GameCube versions.
2788694	2791375	It's launching on every single platform the same day.
2793276	2794156	What else we have here?
2795076	2800597	There was... I know Frame City Killer got pushed back to February, which was one I was looking for.
2800777	2802758	I know Saints Row isn't coming out until next year.
2804418	2807359	Full Auto's not coming out next year, and I'm really disappointed about that, but...
2808240	2812042	The ones I was definitely going to pick up, Quake 4 looks good.
2812862	2816363	Project Gotham Racing 3 is going to be friggin' awesome.
2816403	2820605	Need for Speed, most wanted, is coming out the week before launch.
2821065	2824987	We have a November 19th release date for Frame City Killer by Namco.
2825476	2827498	I got pushed back last week to February.
2829059	2835364	There's also an initial price list from EB that all the games will be $59.99, except for Cameo, which is listed at $49.99.
2836065	2839367	There's some other ones that are $49.99, but yeah, Cameo is one of the cheaper ones.
2839588	2848355	I'm looking forward to Quake 4 and DOA 4, which is weird because I'm usually not into DOA, but for some reason, I'm looking really forward to this new one.
2848375	2849916	EB listed Halo 3 as being July 1, 2006.
2852498	2854780	They haven't even announced anything yet.
2854840	2858503	They're stating that they're presuming it to be the same day as the PS3 release.
2858723	2859084	Interesting.
2859424	2860425	Well, yeah.
2860685	2861426	We've got to keep it moving.
2861466	2862787	So any other emails, DarkSakura?
2862967	2863127	Nope.
2863548	2863788	All right.
2863828	2865709	We're going to close the mailbag until next week.
2865749	2868572	So send us some emails to go at orangelaunchradio.com.
2869662	2873043	Castlevania will be going next-gen.
2873203	2874784	It's already in development.
2875484	2880786	Koji Igarashi has confirmed that the next-gen entry, it will happen.
2881446	2883826	Honestly, it shouldn't be a surprise to anybody.
2883866	2885527	It's one of Konami's most successful series.
2886167	2892669	But, you know, one thing that you might have been curious about is that the handheld releases, it will continue to depict a different timeline.
2892709	2895170	So the handheld releases will still be a little bit different.
2895830	2897091	Curse of Darkness, I think I...
2898513	2899274	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2919059	2920600	Grand Theft Auto and a Grand Theft Auto-like game
2943837	2950701	First off, everybody's been waiting for the Grand Theft Auto Liberty City stories, which is going to be coming out for the PSP at the end of October.
2951662	2958086	And one of the things that I, especially I, have been wondering is, you know, are they going to have some support for Wi-Fi?
2958106	2959386	Because we haven't really heard anything.
2959466	2961067	Well, the answer is yes, they are.
2961808	2967611	They'll actually feature a few different modes, multiplayer for up to six different players.
2968012	2969853	And it will basically have...
2970968	2972709	2 that have been released so far.
2972769	2974050	They said about 7 modes.
2974530	2990460	The first one being Liberty City Survivor, which is your basic deathmatch style gameplay, and Protection Racket, which splits players into teams, which they must protect or destroy a number of different limousines at bases somewhere in the city.
2991120	3000366	They're basically saying that multiplayer mode will be identical to single player, but you'll have more vehicles available up front and 60 different player skins.
3001658	3002338	Awesome.
3002378	3005719	Plus, of course, power-ups and standard hoo-ha there.
3007360	3027026	Now, of course, Microsoft can't be out of any sort of franchise, so their supposed answer to the Grand Theft Auto series is a game which, I don't know, it looks okay, but it's basically a Grand Theft Auto-ish type game with kind of a superhero character.
3027086	3027946	It's Crackdown.
3028436	3057949	and you're basically a superhuman guy who can who's basically cleaning up the city and by cleaning up the city you can steal cars throw cars at people just really interesting stuff I don't know it doesn't look that great to me the screenshots I saw I was like who gives a crap you know I'll pick it up because it'll be fun to play I like throwing cars at people but it doesn't look that impressive I mean especially looking at the other games coming out it just
3059085	3060687	It looks like a third-party release.
3060767	3061767	It's just not really good.
3062828	3064670	But, hey, beta shots, who knows?
3065391	3066472	Who knows?
3066532	3067753	Just a couple more stories, then.
3068173	3069755	We got just a couple more here.
3069935	3071736	One thing I want to talk about is the Mana series.
3072077	3074539	Of course, you know, Secret of Mana, Legend of Mana, all that stuff.
3075239	3076561	We have Children of Mana.
3076641	3078682	It's actually an RPG that's in development right now.
3078702	3080424	It's going to be coming out for the Nintendo DS.
3081105	3084428	That was confirmed in Famitsu Weekly Magazine this week.
3085188	3085849	Don't know how it's...
3086536	3089098	Take advantage of having the two screens and the touch thing.
3089398	3090679	All we know is that it's happening.
3090739	3091399	Children of Mana.
3091820	3096623	I just hope it's better than Legend of Mana because I could not... Legend of Mana ruined the series for me.
3096803	3097503	I couldn't stand it.
3097584	3099005	That PlayStation one was awful.
3099145	3104428	My problem with Legend of Mana was the fact that I imported it in a fit of... Ooh, Mana game!
3104748	3106830	I'm going to make this bold statement.
3106850	3107670	I'll probably get hate mail for it.
3107690	3108811	It was uber text heavy.
3109131	3111393	I liked Secret of Evermore more than I liked...
3111846	3112447	Legend of Mana
3136511	3142472	Neither one of these games, I should point out, is World of Mana, which was that thing they teased at E3 this year, like a big movie.
3143252	3144433	Who knows what the heck that is?
3144713	3147653	I have a hunch it's an MMO, but I could be wrong.
3147793	3148253	I think it's an MMO.
3148273	3152194	I think when you call something world, I have a hunch it's an MMO, but we don't know.
3152234	3153274	We just don't know.
3154395	3155495	Last story tonight, guys.
3157855	3165257	Katamari Craze is spreading the nation, of course, and if you want to check out Namco's website, katamari.namco.com,
3166499	3177566	If you sign up for the website, you can actually download your own little version of the prince who will roll a katamari across your screen at various intervals and will play little looping music.
3178106	3181968	And, of course, you can actually click and drag him and throw him places and all that stuff.
3182208	3183969	I used to have a goat that did that.
3184950	3190553	I guess this would be fun for about five minutes and then get as annoying as those little purple bonsai buddies.
3190633	3191814	Thirty seconds, actually.
3191874	3192134	Really?
3192594	3193295	Thirty seconds.
3193515	3194115	Did you try this?
3194175	3194696	Yes, I did.
3194796	3195236	And it was
3195669	3204591	It's just like, it replays the whole thing, just over and over, and he just rolls the thing all over the screen, basically back and forth, back and forth, back and forth.
3204631	3205771	Does he pick up your windows?
3206171	3214933	I thought he would, and I thought that would have been awesome, because I have a lot of icons he could roll up, but he did not, and it was a great disappointment.
3215813	3219194	We'll just have to send a message to the King of Cosmos for somebody to...
3219987	3222509	Shoot some frickin' laser beams out of their eyes at Namco.
3222629	3222969	Yeah.
3223509	3225410	That just makes me really miss the little goat.
3225851	3226091	Yeah.
3226731	3228993	Because the little goat would occasionally run off to go see Loki.
3229013	3230494	I've got a few last-minute stories here.
3230514	3230894	Sure, what's up?
3231174	3231754	A couple ones.
3232395	3234076	First off, there's going to be a new Resident Evil.
3234116	3235937	This one's coming out for the DS, actually.
3236557	3237758	Resident Evil Deadly Science.
3237938	3238238	Uh-huh.
3239839	3240199	DS.
3240400	3241400	Oh, my gosh.
3241420	3241780	Deadly Science.
3241980	3244202	You people and naming your franchises...
3244824	3247085	Anything that will work with the DS acronym.
3247366	3250868	So, basically, Resident Evil 4 DS, nothing more to see here, move along.
3250968	3263895	Anyways, the other thing is, in November, they're going to be bundling the Red DS with Mario Kart for the price of $149, much like you have seen with the Nintendogs.
3264395	3267257	So, yippee, skippee.
3267517	3269578	The Red DS is already available for import.
3270219	3271479	Some info about Zelda...
3272819	3276381	Basically, you know how Twilight Princess was supposed to be coming out this year?
3276421	3277361	Yeah, and it's not.
3278042	3279422	And they're adding new features.
3279502	3280963	Well, you know what those features are?
3281483	3285685	It's basically going to be enhanced for the Nintendo Revolution.
3286126	3294150	They're going to be adding, if you plug in your GameCube game to the Revolution, you'll be able to use the wonderful Revolution controller for God knows what.
3294230	3296811	But that's basically why it's been pushed back.
3298092	3300713	I was hoping they would put it on the Nintendo system, but...
3301089	3302529	They're not.
3302609	3304150	Honestly, they should have just done it for the revolution.
3304190	3307451	The best description of that controller is on VG Cats.
3308671	3309051	What's that?
3310272	3312272	Basically, the reaction is, I feel dirty.
3313413	3315513	And the last story... You promise?
3316454	3316954	I'm just kidding.
3316994	3317554	Yeah, what's up?
3318294	3318954	I promise.
3319535	3327417	Last story is, Kojima clarifies that the No Place to Hide in the trailer that we saw from Metal Gear Solid 4 is about Snake's age.
3328130	3331411	Basically, this doesn't take no place to hide from death.
3332791	3343354	Basically, because he is a clone of Big Boss, this is only a few years later after number two, or three, I guess, whatever.
3343554	3345374	No, number two, because three took place before two.
3346295	3347235	I've gone cross-eyed.
3349035	3356197	Anyway, so they haven't really said too much else other than there's going to be two different sides that you can either ally with
3357148	3358949	It's still like the little snatcher bot.
3359369	3360669	It looks sexy.
3360829	3362610	I still need to get into Metal Gear Solid.
3363050	3368652	Honestly, though, there's another fun parody of that on VGCats, also their most recent comic.
3368713	3370073	It's really a solid snake.
3370093	3371734	Are they paying you money under the table or something?
3372114	3373614	No, I just love that.
3373654	3374875	That's like my favorite webcomic.
3374935	3375995	No, Spamusement all the way.
3376856	3378816	Okay, video game related webcomics.
3378856	3381477	Spamusement, I have to say, is the only one that makes me crack up like crazy.
3381998	3382758	All right, anyway.
3383271	3383551	That's it.
3383671	3384091	That's it.
3384131	3384831	We're definitely done.
3384851	3386472	When we're talking about webcomics, we know we're done.
3386652	3387792	Nail, coffin, bang.
3388052	3389372	Final thoughts, Loki.
3389772	3391572	OLRPSB.com.
3391652	3392013	Visit it.
3392093	3392653	It's awesome.

3395313	3395653	DarkSakura.
3395673	3396093	And a podcast.
3397133	3400214	Reject false icons and balls.
3401254	3404895	And my final thought is Blue Mage on Final Fantasy XI.
3405195	3405495	Awesome.
3407235	3408275	Don't make a time out of me.
3408295	3409696	Let me know when they get GM answer.
3410136	3410396	I will.
3410716	3411916	Oh, are you going to come back?
3412995	3415056	No, I just want to laugh.
3415156	3415536	All right.
3416497	3417177	That's the show.
