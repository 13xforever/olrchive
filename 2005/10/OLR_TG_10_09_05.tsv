142774	143175	Alright.
144573	147795	Let's start off tonight's show talking about how our gaming week was going.
147835	149195	DarkSakura, how's your gaming week been?
149596	150876	Busy, actually.
150936	155238	I had the week off of school, so I basically sat around and did, you know, crap all day.
155938	160300	Well, of course I had work, but I played some Nintendogs, although I do not know where my DS is now.
160400	160681	Oops.
161221	163002	I think I locked my DS in the drawer at work.
163102	163862	Did the dog eat it?
164719	165079	What dog?
165099	166280	I have a cat.
166340	167581	She'd probably run in fear.
168621	170703	She does look alarmed whenever the puppies bark.
171603	172283	She's a little jealous.
172323	173004	I think she hid it.
173084	174765	She hid it in her litter box and took a big shit on it.
176886	179408	You're remembering to feed your cat, right, as well as the dogs?
179508	179848	Yes.
179968	183330	The cat doesn't let me forget because she hops on the bed and goes, Mom!
183990	184571	Feed me!
184971	185471	Like that.
186432	190994	I've also finally opened my copy of We Love Katamari.
191014	192755	And what do you think?
193015	193836	Cracked out.
194758	196179	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
222643	224805	Dedicating a virtual car we can never afford.
224825	226647	Well, actually, technically, we can't afford one right now.
227447	229389	However, in the real world.
230310	232632	Like an Xbox 360 and a PlayStation 3 and a Revolution.
232732	234774	Xbox 360 does not come first on that list.
236836	237957	Release date-wise, yes.
239078	240739	Opinion-wise, no.
241820	242941	Anything else you've been gaming with this week?
244160	250026	God, yeah, playing lots of Taiko No Tatsu, Taiko Drum Master, I have the US one.
250766	251727	Your roommate, Extifer.
251947	252148	Yes.
252488	255431	We have our Firefly Monday, Firefly Friday.
255731	255871	Right.
256092	262838	And afterwards, we went out, we kidnapped my husband and all went out to Lions and came back.
262918	263599	Which is a restaurant.
263679	263919	Yeah.
264040	264180	Yeah.
264640	274572	Late Night Lions on Firefly Friday and played lots of Taiko no Tatsujin and my hands were all bruised and we were watching the cracked out opening, sleep deprived, thinking, oh, that's so cute.
274732	276955	How does the Japanese version compare to the English version?
277235	279037	When was the last time Jamie played the Japanese version?
279398	279998	Oh, you haven't played it?
280239	280619	I thought you had.
280739	281260	I've played both.
282122	283083	I haven't had time.
283423	286624	The English one is a little bit scaled down compared to the Japanese ones.
286725	288145	It's a lot scaled down.
288245	289106	But it's still cute.
289266	291767	It's cute, but I'm going to go on and import the others.
291847	293848	I didn't honestly have much interest in it beforehand.
294869	298271	But now that, I mean, I played it before, but I just was like, eh.
298431	303253	The arcade one is a heck of a lot of fun because the Taiko drum is like, Taiko, it's actual size.
303574	304494	It's a heck of a lot of fun.
304534	305735	I like playing the arcade version.
306095	311578	Of course, I only know of like one arcade, and that's in LA, which is not exactly around the corner from us, so.
312176	313716	They need to bring out the PSP version here.
314217	314797	It's a lot of fun.
315777	318258	It's not the same when you've got a game like that on the PSP.
318998	322058	It's not the same when you've got a game like that on the PSP because there's no taiko drum.
323299	324019	It still works.
324239	329020	Also, Dan's been playing Castlevania Dawn of Sorrow.
330240	332481	I'm definitely going to touch on that later because I picked that up too.
332581	333381	It's looking pretty nice.
334001	335202	Did you get a chance to play yourself yet?
336382	337562	I turned it on in the bathroom.
338583	339643	He left the DS in there.
340123	340323	Alright.
341469	348114	I trip over the thing because we have this hanging basket in our bathroom and he had it sticking out and I ran into it and knocked it across the floor.
348134	353578	I was like, oh shit, did I break down the DS?
353638	355319	I keep the cat box in the bathroom too.
356300	357901	I was afraid I knocked it into the cat litter.
358882	359142	Oops.
359542	359762	Wow.
360523	362004	All right.
362044	363545	Narrowly safe there, the DS.
364566	365726	I've been playing World of Warcraft too.
365987	366507	How's that going?
368166	368826	www.DarkSakura.com
395100	397162	So strange to me, but interesting.
397242	402166	But it's pretty cool, because the thing is that it was passing to any character in the game.
402326	404728	Because, you know, people can teleport in real life.
405808	414695	But the thing is that it was passing on to any standing character in the game that anyone talks to.
415196	417398	And it was passing to the NPCs.
418988	435054	and that's how it was spreading, is that people would contract whatever that is, heal themselves, they would contract it, teleport in, talk to the NPC, heal themselves, the NPC gets it, passes it on, because it cuts something like 200 and something life each time it drops.
435474	437475	For someone who's level 50, that doesn't matter.
437875	440536	For someone who's just starting off, that's instant death.
441456	442897	And it keeps happening.
443564	447385	So they counteracted it by having them infected with something else.
448405	450426	It's fixed, but I never had to worry about it.
450846	451266	Interesting.
452806	453926	Loki, what have you been playing this week?
454387	456147	I've been playing Burnout Revenge.
457107	458748	Did you play anything besides Burnout?
459468	461888	I played Burnout Legends.
463729	464849	You're becoming a broken record.
465789	466209	Sorry.
466509	470950	You know, I play this during the week, and I don't have time to play stuff at home.
471371	472691	I really wish I did, but...
473834	474634	I play Nintendogs.
475594	476475	Taco's still alive.
477355	478975	I'm kind of done with Nintendogs now.
478995	479415	Me too.
479475	479835	I'm done.
480275	481516	I don't really care about Taco anymore.
481556	483056	I guess the virtual pet thing wasn't for me.
484436	487737	It's just I lost the attention to it because you can't really do that much.
487997	490538	It's still a great game, but it's just, I don't know.
490578	493738	It's fun to throw bones and stuff at their head, but it's just, you know.
493818	494478	The Bark Ball.
494638	495579	It's all about the Bark Ball.
495619	498519	Maybe if there's expansions later on that your dog can learn to do more things.
498559	499760	When you quit playing, give me all your stuff.
500580	500900	All right.
500960	501320	We'll see.
501600	501860	We'll see.
503880	507322	I'm just waiting for Animal Crossing.
508022	509823	I'm so looking forward to the Wi-Fi.
509943	510603	It's going to be awesome.
510843	514785	It's going to be cool, except, I mean, how's that going to work with people coming to your town?
514825	517606	I mean, we could have people destroying towns.
517686	519827	I'm sure they have tested this thing into the ground.
520207	521187	They'll have a way to do it.
521387	523148	Folks can interact with us in our town.
523228	528870	You probably can only allow certain... You probably get to allow who comes into your town and which trains can run into your town.
529150	530050	It's going to be interesting.
530090	531071	I feel like Bark Mode.
531892	532152	Maybe.
532672	533993	I think it's going to be like Bark Mode.
534013	536074	You have to be in like Town Mode or something.
536114	537775	But Wi-Fi somehow.
539796	543518	Obviously you can't run when your DS is off, so you'd be able to monitor who's coming in and out of your town.
544378	544878	It'll be interesting.
545078	546659	No retro game stuff pisses me off.
547800	548060	I know.
548420	549320	Bad Nintendo.
549541	549961	Bad.
550381	553022	But I got to play against Mario Voice.
553923	554323	At E3?
554423	555623	At E3.
555764	556884	And you said I was lovely.
556984	558585	The whole reason I bought...
559338	559858	and DarkSakura.com.
584966	586027	Animal Crossing was such a great game.
586787	589349	God, I would still be playing it if there was just a little more to do.
589369	593372	I hope they bring out a really expansive version of it later on.
593812	598035	For any of those companies out there, I'm willing to advertise in my town for your products.
598916	599216	Shut up.
602321	603322	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
620840	625543	And the thing is, I don't know if anyone's ever listened to when they speak in the U.S.
625563	627884	when they're actually saying every letter in the words that they're speaking.
628564	634047	Well, in the Japanese one, now they do say it very fast, it's hard to catch it, but they're saying every syllable.
634147	637509	They're actually speaking Japanese when they talk to you.
638269	639029	But it's very fast.
639110	639770	It's just very fast.
639790	640590	Cartoon-y style.
641391	641931	Exactly.
641991	644392	However, if you listen carefully enough, you can actually hear them talking.
645793	647074	Slow it down, record it, slow it down.
648414	649675	Anything else you've been playing this week, Logie?
651580	654181	My week, a few games I want to talk about.
654241	655882	I want to follow up on Lost in Blue.
655902	663746	It was something that I kind of touched on last week, but I didn't really get to give a more in-depth impression of it because I feel like I didn't get to play enough of it.
664166	665727	So I played a little more Lost in Blue.
666207	667848	Sorry to say it didn't really hold my interest.
668448	671510	I would have to say borderline not recommend Lost in Blue.
671970	674291	I think there is an audience for this game out there.
675154	682459	It really reminds me of an old-school computer point-and-click game, like an old-school King's Quest, Loom-style game.
683140	691546	And there's definitely some creative things to be done with the stylus, like digging in the sand and starting the fire and some of the things you do.
691606	699131	But I was just really bored with the story, and it seemed like I got so close to dying.
699191	699391	What?
699591	700572	Did you get the milk a goat?
701593	703594	I didn't get that far to the milk and the goat part, no.
704595	704675	Oh.
705191	708374	I heard it was almost impossible to milk the goat.
708934	712177	The game, honestly, I didn't really want to play it that much longer.
712197	713618	It just really didn't hold my interest.
714559	716561	So I can't really recommend Lost in Blue.
716601	719443	But I do think there are people out there that would like this type of game.
720044	726750	So I'm not going to completely say avoid it, but I'm going to say borderline non-recommend because I think there are people out there that might enjoy it.
726790	730213	If you like those old-style computer point-and-click games, you actually might get a kick out of this.
730713	731714	You might like this more than I did.
732549	757872	and I did like some King's Quest games and some of that stuff I just wasn't like really into it so that's why I can't King's Quest bored the tears out of me but I love Loom see I love King's Quest 4 like that is an awesome game and some of the other King's Quest in fact I have a King's Quest related story for later but we'll talk about that in a minute the other game I played based on a recommendation in the forums I didn't even know this game was out but a Tecmo Arcade Collection I think it's the official name Tecmo Collection something along those lines
758533	759473	Thanks for watching!
774338	775318	I think that's pretty awesome.
793703	796965	And that's kind of how I felt playing a lot of these games in the Tecmo Collection.
796985	800586	I was like, boy, I remember this game being a lot better.
801607	804768	And granted, you go into a game like Rygar.
804828	809150	Now, Rygar on the NES was completely different than it was in the arcade.
809190	814573	The arcade was like a side-scroller action-based game, where the Nintendo one was...
815262	815763	and DarkSakura.
840182	842862	They're really like gems hidden in this collection that are very cool.
842882	846903	Like I like Solomon's Key, the arcade version is very cool and some of the other stuff in there as well.
847603	850624	Here's my biggest problem with the Tecmo collection.
851084	862846	It's $29.99 not $19.99 and I honestly think $29.99 is a little high when you consider that most of the retro at least where I paid for it, it was $29.99 and there were other retro collections sitting right next to it.
862886	865287	The Midway one, the Namco one for $19.99 and I just
868214	872056	I don't think the price additional is really justified with this.
872096	873337	So what if it has Tecmo Bowl?
873457	876199	I think $19.99 is a more fair price to be charging for this game.
877279	887985	So I'm going to borderline recommend it just because I think there are some good titles in here that a lot of folks might remember from the NES, but they never got to play the arcade versions of some of these games.
888285	889426	And I think it's worth checking out.
889466	891387	There are a lot of really good gems in this series.
892468	896490	But it's nothing to drop everything and go right out and buy.
897708	898489	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
915680	916120	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
931178	936822	I was so bored with this game, I forced myself to play the game a little bit longer, but I was just like, this is stupid.
937483	939624	Why is this a game on the DS?
940044	943267	This should be a game that's a flash thing on somebody's website.
943547	945648	I can't believe somebody will waste their money on Sprung.
945969	949491	I definitely do not recommend, avoid like the plague, Sprung.
949551	950191	It's awful.
950432	951312	It's not even a game.
951633	956356	It's a scenario-based borefest.
957182	960263	Keep in mind that those games are very, very popular in Japan.
960343	962824	Yeah, but they're also better in Japan.
962884	964205	He has Tokimeki Memorial.
964665	966546	You get to see boobs in the Japanese one.
966566	968887	You don't even get that here.
968907	971828	They did a Tokimeki for girls.
973048	978631	And in this one, you can play as the girl or the guy, but it doesn't matter.
978851	979691	Both stories suck.
979791	980891	So there's the girl one.
980951	984513	I mean, she actually has to convince the guy to have sex with her because...
986352	988994	I don't know if they ever got it on, I just didn't care.
989474	991615	I wanted that game out of my DS, it's that bad.
992516	996719	And for the record, the only game I've played that's worse than that is Pink Pals.
998320	999721	Chatroom Sim.
1000401	1004824	Yeah, PictoChat plus crappy minigames.
1005144	1005584	What is that?
1005644	1006025	Come on.
1006945	1009327	Anyway, last game, Castlevania Don Isaro.
1010526	1012687	Finally, a really, really good game I played this week.
1012767	1023591	If you liked the most recent Castlevania game that they put out on the Game Boy Advance, where you're collecting the souls and absorbing the souls, you're going to like this one because it's the exact same freaking thing.
1023751	1025212	It's a continuation in that story.
1025292	1037176	And it's an absolute continuation of the story, except they added the magic seal thing, which is kind of hokey, but they did some other touchscreen elements, like certain souls that you absorb, you use the touchscreen as part of it, and that's kind of neat.
1037617	1038577	And you can play as Alucard.
1039395	1040316	Oh, I didn't get that far yet.
1040416	1046921	I believe, because Dan showed me something on one of the sites, I believe that Alucard is an unlockable character in that game.
1047541	1048202	Oh, that's cool.
1048342	1048822	Oh, I hope so.
1048842	1052385	Then you meet with the other people and you can switch off like in Castlevania 3.
1052425	1053185	That's cool.
1053205	1055627	I haven't gotten that far in the game yet, but I do know I like this game.
1056188	1059530	Symphony of the Night, one of the greatest video games ever, in my opinion.
1060050	1068717	And although I haven't followed the advanced games so well, I did like this most recent one they had, the Aria of Sorrow, but
1069691	1070212	I like this.
1070312	1071433	The continuation, it's great.
1071453	1074795	And there's extra features, like a versus and a soul trading thing.
1075376	1075776	It's great.
1076297	1079760	For Castlevania fans, especially if you're a fan of Symphony Night, this one doesn't disappoint.
1080160	1084904	My only complaints is that the drawing thing is a little bit hokey.
1087446	1088587	That's about it, honestly.
1088847	1089428	It's a great game.
1089488	1091009	I recommend Castlevania Dinosaur.
1091385	1097808	I still love the opinion they need to do a US release of what was the Saturn version of Symphony of the Night in Japan.
1098048	1099268	Oh, where you could play as Maria, right?
1099409	1099629	Yeah.
1100309	1104711	That game, the one problem I had with it is that the 3D effects were not as good.
1104731	1106452	The 2D effects were much better.
1106912	1109133	The sound was infinitely better because as...
1110013	1114897	The sound processor and 2D graphics in the Saturn were far superior to the PlayStation.
1116077	1120881	But it had so much more to offer that I think that game would sell very well if it comes out over here.
1121021	1125564	You know a complaint I heard about Castlevania and Dinosaur... Symphony of the Night?
1125944	1126765	No, not Symphony of the Night.
1126785	1127925	Castlevania and Dinosaur.
1127945	1129346	I don't know why I'm correcting myself.
1130767	1133289	A complaint I heard was you don't get to use a whip.
1134009	1136211	Yeah, it's not a Castlevania game if you don't use a whip.
1137665	1139967	It is totally a Castlevania game.
1140427	1141288	I don't get that argument.
1141428	1145370	You do unlock a character who is one of the Belmonts, and you do get to use a whip.
1146030	1146391	So what?
1146411	1147491	You don't get to use a whip.
1147511	1149873	The swords play practically the exact same way.
1149913	1150513	I don't get that.
1150993	1151514	Wait a second.
1151534	1153755	You need to use a whip in Symphony of the Night.
1153795	1154135	I know.
1154175	1154716	Yes, you do.
1155316	1157397	Richter is an unlockable character.
1157597	1159078	Well, still, that's the same thing, though.
1159819	1161620	And you play through Richter's story.
1162268	1164811	Symphony of the Night is the greatest Castlevania game, period.
1164992	1165432	Period.
1165873	1166033	Ever.
1166133	1168616	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
1168696	1171380	Not even Simon's Quest, not even Castlevania 3, not even the original.
1171400	1173563	Dracula X was infinitely better.
1173743	1176967	No, I, I, you show me Dracula X, I still think Symphony of the Night is the best.
1176987	1179951	Dracula X was the last true Castlevania game.
1182062	1182482	Possibly.
1183303	1183963	I could see that argument.
1183984	1185545	But not the Super Nintendo version.
1186185	1187246	Not the Super Nintendo version.
1187346	1187806	Well, no.
1188027	1198254	And even that was good, but when you started getting into the whole Metroid-style gameplay, it became... You can't... I don't think there's a comparison.
1199936	1203799	Anyway, we've got to get into some other actual news going on this week.
1204299	1207862	As much as I could argue about Castlevania all night long... Hi, we're nerds.
1207902	1208602	We do a radio show.
1208642	1209683	Let's talk about it.
1209983	1210884	And hi, you're a nerd.
1210904	1211685	You're listening to it.
1212717	1213177	Nerd!
1213377	1213477	Geek!
1243690	1245192	Thank God I did not vote for him.
1254642	1254922	I don't know.
1254962	1260487	I mean, honestly, I could say I didn't vote for him either, but it was written by a Democratic assemblyman.
1261188	1262789	It's really a bipartisan thing.
1262969	1267593	I just think there's... I don't think everything was truly being considered with this.
1267893	1271236	I just think there could have been a better option to do what they wanted to do.
1272177	1272957	I'm cool with them.
1273518	1275820	I don't know how much I want to rehash the same topic, though, honestly.
1276320	1278342	Just go listen to an old podcast.
1278362	1279283	I know I've talked about it before.
1279303	1281565	I just have a quick description for it.
1281645	1281805	Okay.
1284261	1284882	Getting more voters.
1286823	1289725	But that could be said of either party in this case.
1290186	1292567	Because the media kind of plays to this.
1292688	1296350	He's taking the popular opinion and using the media hype to gain himself some more voters.
1298392	1299092	Who knows?
1299213	1299953	He's a loser.
1301414	1304176	GameStop and EB Games, the merger was approved.
1305057	1308119	We talked previously that GameStop was going to buy EB Games.
1308360	1309040	It was approved.
1309140	1309961	The merger went through.
1311942	1313343	I don't know if the names are changing, though.
1313363	1314024	I don't think they are.
1314892	1315513	Gizmondo White Screen
1339087	1340287	You have a widescreen Gizmondo.
1340667	1342388	It looks like the PSP.
1343288	1344048	I think it's funny.
1344468	1355510	I like the phrase, though, that the rumors that Gizmondo is $210 million in the hole isn't going to stop the release on time.
1355530	1357571	I'm sure the Phantom console is worse in the hole.
1357831	1361011	The only reason it's widescreen is they're trying to compete with the Pop Station.
1363192	1364372	Sure.
1364912	1368593	Taking a look at the image of the widescreen Gizmondo
1369497	1372220	I have to say, you know, and see, I liked the Gizmondo.
1372280	1374081	I had absolutely no problem with it.
1374542	1375743	This thing does look pretty sleek.
1376804	1378125	Yeah, but does it have sight talking?
1379586	1381968	Oh, they definitely changed the look of that from what they were showing at E3.
1381988	1389875	You know what's funny is I remember the original shots of the PSP back when it was conceptual still.
1390136	1391837	They had shots of fish as well.
1392438	1395240	I think that's kind of ironic in that picture of the widescreen Gizmondo.
1395260	1395981	There's fish on it.
1396567	1398108	Maybe that is a favorable sign.
1398368	1400049	Are you going to be picking one of these up, DarkSakura?
1400549	1401089	I hope so.
1401189	1409853	I mean, ever since I got to play it at E3 and played that game, Johnny Whatever, that had the karaoke mode, we're sort of like guitar freaks.
1410453	1411593	What other games are on this thing?
1411613	1413774	That's the only one I really know anything about is the Johnny Whatever.
1413794	1414735	Yeah, see?
1415095	1416636	And what's the golden rule of gaming?
1416696	1418316	We brought this up on the three-hour show this week.
1418556	1421178	A system is only as good as the games that are on it.
1421278	1423779	So I want to hear less about the Gizmondo and more about the games.
1424279	1424419	So...
1425078	1425819	DarkSakura.com
1442441	1444603	Loki, what's going on in the hack and crack scene?
1444623	1447926	I know there was, of course, the mandatory PSP update that happened.
1448046	1448366	Yes, 2.01.
1448786	1454311	It adds no features whatsoever other than fixing the hole that allows you to do stuff with your PSP.
1455932	1462878	Other than that, since people love the hack of the firmware, they're doing some more cosmetic modifications.
1463118	1468082	The first one is they have a guide to removing the broken icons.
1468202	1470264	It requires you to hex edit your
1470874	1477716	firmware and the runner program and basically just blanked out those icons instead of actually having them pop up.
1478277	1481938	The other one is, you know those little wavy lines that are on there that prevent burn in?
1482258	1483919	You can get rid of those too as well.
1484719	1485999	Just more cosmetic stuff.
1486219	1487080	I like the wavy lines.
1488000	1489341	I know, but some people don't.
1489461	1490101	And you know what?
1490921	1492041	They just want to remove them.
1492162	1494762	So, by golly, they're going to do it.
1495823	1496263	So, yeah.
1497527	1505656	We were talking earlier in the show a little bit about Nintendogs, and I was saying that I get a little burned out on Nintendogs, but the fun is just beginning for some of our other friends, right, Jamie?
1506136	1506476	Yep.
1507237	1511061	On the 7th, Nintendogs was just released in Europe.
1512522	1512663	And...
1514949	1517270	Loki, didn't you post some photos from that in your blog?
1517430	1519690	It was friggin' cute is what it was.
1520110	1524351	Yes, they had some pictures of the people bringing their dogs with them.
1525212	1527952	It was just absolutely adorable.
1528373	1534914	They've got one where the dog's actually sniffing the... or licking the... Oh my god!
1535354	1536715	Dog licking the DS!
1537195	1539776	Trying to be a celebrity.
1539796	1541476	DarkSakura, any word on how this game is selling?
1541997	1542758	Over in Europe.
1542998	1543618	Taking a look.
1543738	1546320	Oh, this is a cute picture of a puppy in a soccer ball.
1546840	1547241	I'm sorry.
1547321	1548682	I love that game so much.
1551323	1553625	It got an 8 out of 10 by Eurogamer.
1554361	1555742	Just to read the small paragraph.
1576985	1583608	Well, we're enchanted by it since it's a highly engaging and entertaining game and one that makes excellent use of the DS's unique capabilities.
1583908	1584808	Plus, it's got puppies in it.
1586449	1587209	I think that sums it up.
1587389	1597873	By the way, I will add, they did throw a puppy party to celebrate the launch of this game, which featured such wonderful events as dog-loving celebrities.
1598573	1604755	They had actual canine celebrities as well, some dogs from different shows and stuff.
1605325	1614468	They had dog's eye video screens, a very important pooch chill out area, and the doggy Olympics as well as a doggy disco.
1615148	1615308	Wow.
1615328	1616149	Doggy disco?
1616589	1617469	Doggy disco.
1617789	1623271	Now, because Nintendogs is so big, there's other people out there that want to steal some of Nintendogs Thunder, correct?
1625152	1625812	Yeah, there are.
1625872	1627713	I'm also trying to find the numbers, by the way.
1627933	1628293	Oh, well, no.
1628633	1629293	But, yeah, 03...
1631883	1632884	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1651360	1653162	Is there screenshots up there on your screen there?
1653202	1660868	Hanadeka Club is sort of like The Dog with the fisheye camera, so it's all the puppies done the same way.
1661568	1664691	There are eight breeds to choose from, including Pugs, Chihuahua, Shih Tzu.
1666532	1672957	The dogs can talk with their owners, find out about their likes and dislikes, and will play games of fetch, frisbee, balls, and bones.
1673858	1677101	I'm sure that it's crap compared to the other one.
1677681	1679743	I don't know, because I do like the Hanadeka Club.
1681143	1683326	I'd look at it, I wouldn't, you know.
1683906	1694659	But this actually is, so far it looks like that it's out, it will be released this holiday season.
1695340	1695520	Alright.
1697302	1699483	Moving on, there's some other stuff coming out for the DS.
1700184	1701365	I thought this was very interesting.
1701465	1707550	Square Enix, as we call them, Squeenix, but Square Enix is actually putting out a game called Mario Basket 3 vs. 3.
1707990	1712353	So shock, it's something that's not a role-playing game, although it's not the first time they haven't done a role-playing game.
1712393	1713294	But very interesting.
1713314	1717637	They're kind of doing this little basketball-looking game, and it's a three-on-three game using the DS.
1718378	1719719	Should be interesting.
1719759	1722181	It has a very Mario Kart-style look to it.
1722554	1725695	which I think is very interesting considering it's being developed not by Nintendo but by Square.
1726536	1728397	We did get Mario Baseball.
1728997	1729397	That's true.
1729557	1729837	That's true.
1729877	1730618	That just recently came out.
1731118	1737741	Also, Nintendo is unveiling a new Wario Land game that's coming out very soon and that'll also be on the DS.
1738081	1739442	So, should be interesting.
1740359	1742900	I want to mention this for PSP, our friends on the PSP.
1743340	1748481	Detel has released a 4GB hard drive for the PSP.
1749341	1759304	Now, because this is a hard drive, it also has a battery that goes with it, and it's supposed to boost your time that you play, or it's supposed to boost the loading times as well using the hard drive.
1759324	1766066	Well, it's twice the battery power for one, because it's basically this giant battery that sticks out of your battery port there.
1766286	1766886	Right.
1766966	1769628	Then it's also got a 4GB drive in there as well.
1769708	1776651	Now, the only bad thing about Daytel is they've got really bad... They have a really bad track record with their batteries.
1776811	1778372	Their batteries tend to explode.
1778652	1779193	Oh my gosh!
1779753	1787357	So, hopefully this won't have the explosive feature in it, but hey, more storage space is always good.
1787377	1788858	It's just expensive.
1789918	1791399	And speaking of which, no price changes.
1791846	1793227	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1817268	1822790	But if you want to store tons of crap... Especially since you can't buy actual 4GB hard drives anymore.
1823271	1824491	And if you could, they'd be like $15.
1825792	1839337	Well, they're releasing that one peripheral that the team executor is working on that's actually going to be using CompactFlash and MicroDrives, which go up to 6GB.
1840057	1842318	And those are a little bit less expensive.
1842358	1845079	But actually, if you get that on there...
1845464	1856508	and then you add the, there's an adapter you can make or buy that converts laptop drives to work with CompactFlash, you can in a sense have, you know, a 30 gig, 120 gig drive.
1856668	1864331	Of course, you'd be spending that, you know, upwards to about $500 for it, but, you know, hey, if you want more space, I mean, that's one way to do it.
1864751	1866492	Let's see.
1867572	1873074	Alright, I'm looking to see here real quick, because I know they had that going for it.
1873354	1874595	They also had actually
1877379	1881282	The PSP TV stuff, they've announced a price point for that as well.
1882203	1882764	Oh, what was that?
1882964	1883765	Do you know the price for that?
1883805	1885246	The price for that is going to be $119.
1885466	1887228	They're taking pre-orders right now.
1887668	1890891	One of the things that they added to it is an S-video out, so you can have that.
1890931	1896617	Plus, the swappable, you can do 4.3 or 16.9 aspect ratios.
1897137	1899840	Speaking of money, but going to a different company...
1900322	1911388	There's rumors going around this week, and I think some of it comes back to Joystick ran an article, that's Joystick with a Q, .com ran an article about Nintendo possibly releasing the Revolution for $99.
1913769	1914930	Hmm.
1914970	1916811	Kind of a rumor that's going around right now.
1917211	1923714	Wouldn't that be very interesting, though, because the Xbox 360 is going to be, what, $300 for the core, $400 for a little more?
1926360	1930422	PlayStation 3, we don't know yet, but we can expect it will probably be about the same.
1930842	1939026	So what a way for Nintendo to catch up by being kind of the last one out the gate to really, you know, create interest in their system because it would only be $100.
1939066	1940127	Can you imagine that?
1940147	1941227	It would be very smart.
1941828	1942368	I'd have to...
1943118	1957869	The only thing I can think of logically is if the system is not that expensive to make for parts and labor and however much they would pay per system for marketing and then for shipping, sales.
1958149	1961051	You'd have to see what their overhead is in this.
1961512	1968517	However, you can make enough product with even a minute profit to make back and pull a good profit.
1969278	1970359	by selling more units.
1993357	1994439	If this is really true.
1994599	1996322	Even so, it's comparable.
1996382	1997123	That's half.
1997143	1998224	It's very competitive.
1998245	1999106	That's half as much.
1999607	2003853	That would be a real way for Nintendo to gain some ground if they were going to be the last ones out the gate, but
2005164	2005564	Who knows?
2005724	2008565	There's the whole innovation thing with the controller.
2008605	2014127	But on top of that, Nintendo has always been oriented toward more family child games.
2014407	2024349	What parent is going to want to buy their small child a $350 system when they can get a $150 system that would be easier to play?
2024429	2024909	Absolutely.
2024989	2027970	I have something to add here.
2028170	2030631	I don't think we've heard everything about the revolution yet.
2031406	2031906	and so on.
2061243	2068668	Game Company out there, they're referring to one of the big three, is actually going to be using this in their next console.
2070049	2080296	So I think what it's going to be is, and this is my theory, is that they're going to have, it's not going to be as powerful photorealistic-wise, but it's going to be 3D.
2081416	2082157	Interesting.
2082977	2085099	Which will be why you need a 3D remote.
2085119	2086460	We'll see.
2087338	2088699	Peter Jackson's King Kong Demo
2111286	2112046	Available for download.
2112106	2117489	I think that's probably hitting a lot of the major game sites because I actually saw a little clip of the game in action.
2117549	2118970	It looks very nice.
2119010	2126554	If you want to see what the Xbox 360 might look like by using your PC, kind of, because the graphics are supposed to be comparable, check it out on your PC.
2126654	2129935	There's also a teaser for Tomb Raider Legends X360.
2130756	2132497	And teaser would be not playable though, right?
2132517	2133257	Just a little trailer?
2133457	2137139	Right, but it is there to see some of the stuff.
2137199	2140861	Also, one I'm kind of interested in myself is the Possession Zombie Takedown.
2141843	2142443	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2161378	2175390	DarkSakura, what are you going to tell the kids about tonight?
2176031	2178793	Today's piece of advice is how to jump from a moving train.
2179273	2182756	Because you never know when you're going to be having to jump from the train, or throw Mama from the train.
2184298	2189222	Number one, make your jump from the end of the last, the rear car.
2190231	2190952	Obviously.
2191772	2192172	Duh.
2192413	2195294	You don't jump from the middle.
2195735	2195995	Sorry.
2196235	2199897	Wait for the train to slow as it rounds the bend in the tracks if you have time.
2201278	2202919	Pick your landing spot.
2203379	2207722	The ideal spot is relatively soft and free of obstructions.
2208503	2210964	Get as low to the floor as possible, bending your knees.
2212885	2218449	Jump perpendicular, that's sideways, children, to the train, leaping as far as you can.
2219071	2221772	Cover your head with your arms and roll like a log when you land.
2222552	2224732	But my final, final piece of advice.
2224952	2225172	Yes.
2225712	2228473	If you hitchhike and stick to cars, much easier.
2228493	2229633	You don't have to jump from a train.
2231574	2231854	All right.
2232474	2233434	Looking for that piece of advice.
2234414	2236895	Loki, what's going on with the Xbox 360?
2237235	2245357	I know you like to talk about homebrew stuff for PSP, but now it sounds like there's independent stuff going on for the 360.
2246117	2246677	What's this about?
2246957	2248338	XBOX Live Arcade Marble Blast Ultra
2274346	2275346	That may not be a bad thing, though.
2275366	2276407	Marble Madness is excellent.
2295557	2298298	Project Gotham Racing 3, and this game looks friggin' awesome.
2298618	2303080	It's kind of a combo between Asteroids, Rez, and Fantavision.
2303120	2304780	Just tons of explosions on the screen.
2306401	2313103	The other ones that they were showing off, which actually is pretty cool, is Joust, the classic Atari game.
2313323	2313824	Right on.
2314524	2315424	So you gotta love that.
2315544	2317605	Now they have Joust, but do they have Burger Time?
2319320	2320581	No Burger King yet.
2320621	2321021	Sucks.
2321181	2321282	Sucks.
2321302	2321682	Beer Tapper.
2321702	2322562	Worst system ever.
2322802	2323183	No, I'm kidding.
2323203	2331568	But actually, one of the things I was going to mention is the Xbox hard drive that they're coming out with, it does come with some other features.
2331848	2333569	Yeah, I was looking about this.
2333649	2336011	What's this, like Hexic or something?
2336071	2336531	Hexen.
2337351	2338612	No, Hexen's a different game.
2340133	2340473	Hexen.
2340774	2342174	It's like a Tetris game.
2342215	2343956	It's actually done by the guy that did Tetris.
2344596	2345977	There's going to be actually videos available.
2346598	2347659	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
2370138	2373399	But all this crap's getting preloaded on if you buy the hard drive.
2373579	2377560	Yeah, and it's either if you buy it with the system or by itself.
2377600	2378440	That's going to be on there.
2378980	2384822	So you get a game, which is kind of cool, but you need the hard drive if you're going to play any of these games because you've got to download them to your hard drive.
2384902	2386162	Oh, the arcade stuff, yeah.
2386282	2386923	Yeah.
2386963	2391164	The other game that they showed was Wick and the Fable of Souls, and I have no idea what that was.
2391204	2395245	It just looks like some RPG or shooter game that has a tree in it.
2395485	2395665	Yeah.
2396477	2398018	SkyTree, that's all I know.
2398919	2399800	Good way to sum that up.
2400800	2401541	It's interesting.
2401601	2415171	Now, the other thing to disappoint fans, unfortunately, at launch, a couple games have gone bye-bye, and those would be Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter for all those Tom Clancy fans, and, of course, Frame City Killer for all those Namco fans.
2416653	2419235	So, starting to push back a little bit there.
2419255	2420416	It's a good Valentine's Day gift.
2421536	2424539	Nothing says I love you like Tom Clancy's Advanced Warfighter.
2424679	2425139	I'm sure.
2425159	2425199	Um,
2427000	2429682	Speaking of Xbox, might as well roll on with Microsoft here.
2429722	2433005	This week we had Doom 3 Resurrection of Evil come out.
2433626	2444775	Not too often on the consoles, I mean it's happened before, but not too often do you see expansions coming out for games where you have to already own the first game to play this expansion.
2445435	2447597	And that's what's going on with the Doom 3 here.
2447637	2448097	Not quite.
2448418	2448658	Really?
2449058	2449899	No, it's its own thing.
2450039	2451600	Did I misunderstand the article?
2451760	2451981	Yes.
2452341	2452881	Oh, crap.
2453041	2454443	It's actually their game's re-release.
2454483	2456004	It's like Ninja Gaiden Black, uh,
2456536	2459078	It's basically a re-release with the PC expansion stuff.
2459118	2462360	You've got a couple more weapons and more levels.
2463301	2464702	That's not what somebody else told me.
2464762	2467584	Somebody else told me, well, I guess because maybe the PC version was like that.
2468044	2470026	Yeah, PC version, you have the original one.
2470386	2470886	Well, crap.
2471286	2472367	Well, that's nothing special then.
2472427	2473248	Just another game coming out.
2473288	2474429	No, Doom 3 was pretty cool.
2474749	2475589	It was kind of scary.
2475649	2476990	It's also, the price point's lower.
2477531	2477931	That's true.
2477951	2478291	It's $29.99.
2478592	2479392	That's very true.
2479412	2481614	Comedic in Doom is the movie.
2482494	2482734	Oh, yeah.
2482754	2483455	Did you see the trailer?
2483555	2484636	Oh, forget the movie.
2485016	2485576	I'm going to see it.
2485636	2485777	I'm not.
2485857	2486237	I'm not.
2486693	2489333	I want to see it and laugh at it and then watch The Rock for an hour.
2489433	2491634	That first person thing was so hokey.
2492014	2495155	I'm sorry.
2495335	2498395	If the Halo trailer ends up looking like that, I'm going to laugh.
2498895	2504176	You know, I still have to remind our listeners, speaking of movies, Silent Hill coming out next year.
2504736	2514658	Yeah, didn't you have something about like a... I'm still trying to find more on it, but there's a couple more people listed on IMDb like we can really...
2515393	2518118	You know, say yeah, I am DB, but... Right.
2518238	2526612	They have a link to the article, to the, uh... Not an article, but an interview with Roger Avery that I had touched on a few weeks ago.
2526632	2526692	Hmm.
2527874	2527974	Um...
2530527	2534709	I remembered us getting as far as some of the other actors in there.
2534729	2539512	We also have Jodell Fairland, Alice Cridge, is that how her name is pronounced?
2540412	2544994	That also goes in a little bit more into the behind-the-scenes cast, but it's still Sean Bean.
2545014	2545515	That's cool.
2546355	2546655	All right.
2548697	2551659	I guess at this point, while we're getting a little late in the show, but that's all right.
2551699	2556062	It's never too late to open up the old mailbag and see what's going on, what our listeners have said to us.
2556722	2561865	Of course, you can email the show by just sending us an email to go at orange lounge radio dot com.
2562306	2566268	Dark Sakura, she reads and sifts through the mail all day long.
2566408	2571352	Our our hundreds and hundreds of spam and our one or two actual emails that come in.
2571372	2571772	No, I'm kidding.
2572971	2574592	DarkSakura, what's in our email bag this week?
2574872	2582779	Well, our friend Mike from 1up.com, who had that very interesting article about the NDAs, sent me a movie file.
2583080	2583820	It's really funny.
2584361	2587523	I'm going to try to find a way to get this up on our site, hopefully.
2587543	2588765	I'm sure there's a way we can get it up.
2589445	2593309	But it's of one of the Nintendo Micro.
2594209	2595270	Oh, the Game Boy Micro.
2595350	2597272	Yeah, I saw one of those today, and I was like, I'm not going to buy that.
2597702	2608853	It involves a maze with a rat with a micro on one side and a piece of cheese on the other and the mouse showing its opinion.
2609974	2610435	Okay.
2611736	2613278	It was humping the micro.
2614599	2615140	That's lovely.
2616019	2616539	Very lovely.
2616659	2620840	I think that was probably the most messed up thing I've seen all day, but very hilarious.
2621660	2624541	Also, in response to Sasuke, I wanted to know what the Click-O-Vision is.
2624601	2626722	I believe we were talking about the Coleco-Vision.
2626882	2628702	Yes, the C-O-L-E-C-O-Vision.
2629482	2633243	Coleco also made swimming pools and Cabbage Patch Kids.
2633563	2634603	I knew about the Cabbage Patch Kids.
2634624	2635644	I didn't know about the swimming pools.
2636144	2636444	Yep.
2638845	2642745	You know, a lot of gaming companies make other things you may not know about, like Konami and slot machines.
2643246	2643646	Yeah.
2643966	2644686	I know there's others, but...
2645239	2646800	That's the one that comes to mind because I like to gamble.
2647080	2656665	Also, Bradley, not to be confused with Arcadian42, also sent me the link to the GameSpot article about pocket dogs.
2657386	2657806	Ah, okay.
2657826	2662028	We like it when the listeners try to clue us in a little bit.
2662089	2662549	No, it's cool.
2662629	2663009	We like it.
2667832	2672594	Actually, I got another email from Rob with two Bs.
2673215	2673395	Okay.
2675233	2679755	He actually just had a little bit more about the super huge games.
2680195	2683396	I think I like this one sentence in particular here.
2683496	2685217	The industry is taking sides.
2685657	2688538	So it's Betamax versus VHS all over again.
2688818	2690859	Oh, with the HD DVD and Blu-ray?
2690899	2692319	With the formats, exactly.
2692419	2694440	But that does make perfect sense.
2694520	2696160	Oh, no, it absolutely makes sense.
2696260	2700482	But I really hope before these things get into...
2701314	2702315	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2728877	2731640	Remember Penny Arcade and their character, the Divics.
2731740	2732782	I think that's hilarious.
2735605	2737848	Also about the worst game.
2739109	2742433	See, I always said it was E.T., but he said it was Firefly Magic Carpet.
2744015	2747980	What about Zelda Wanda Gamelon?
2749328	2749968	I don't know.
2749988	2751209	These are pretty rotten ones.
2751229	2754970	Frickin' play Sprung and tell me you didn't just play the worst game.
2755571	2756331	Or Ping Pals.
2756611	2758912	Pick up either one of those and tell me you just didn't play the worst game.
2759572	2762634	I actually, at least Zelda amused me for a few seconds.
2763994	2764314	I don't know.
2765295	2770317	Now, one of our listeners wrote in, Danny, and I want to read this email.
2770437	2770617	Sure.
2770897	2774178	Because I 100% freaking agree with it, okay?
2774839	2775059	Okay.
2775379	2775459	Um...
2777057	2779500	I believe I speak for some people when I say fuck IGN
2782418	2788319	Just the other day I was trying to read a gaming article when all of a sudden a random yellow circle covered over the text I was reading.
2788759	2790399	As it turned out, this was an ad.
2790519	2792260	An ad that had obscured what I was reading.
2792860	2796100	After realizing what it was, I was instantly irritated.
2796281	2800421	IGN is notorious for planting obnoxious advertisements everywhere you try to visit.
2800801	2805742	Clicking a link, viewing an image, forced uncontrollable downloading of a video ad when you want to watch something.
2805902	2809903	To be fair, this is a trend on the internet as a whole that IGN is...
2810960	2815063	and I'm sure is not the only gaming site but of course one of the most prevalent.
2815323	2815863	I don't get those.
2815903	2816564	I paid for mine.
2817104	2819306	Well, you're a corporate whore anyway.
2820227	2821308	And there's the other thing on here.
2821388	2824811	And how about disallowing QuickTime Media for the majority of the time?
2825671	2829594	On a Macintosh, Windows Media Player is atrocious to use and watch on a Mac.
2829674	2831716	Then again, Windows Media Player is just atrocious, period.
2831756	2832397	That's my opinion.
2832417	2834138	You know what I want to bitch about IGN?
2834378	2836320	Is all their downloads stop halfway.
2836940	2837461	There's that too.
2839681	2844344	But there's also in here, you'd think with all the advertising IGN puts up that they'd have the bandwidth to allow QuickTime.
2845325	2846326	I don't know.
2846346	2847487	They have QuickTime for everything.
2847827	2848988	Once you're like an insider.
2849028	2850048	You have to be a paid member.
2850068	2850929	You have to pay for it.
2851069	2851549	Sorry.
2852390	2856052	But when this bot came out of nowhere and blocked the article I wanted to read, it was the last straw.
2856092	2861376	A few years ago, IGN was limiting how many images you could view per day, and now they're blocking the text you want to read.
2862103	2862903	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2882647	2884769	Really good news on things that are coming out.
2884789	2886510	They have an excellent download section.
2887130	2889672	There's also 1UP, which I actually mentioned looking at 1UP.com.
2889772	2891073	And they've been good to us.
2891313	2892134	1UP's pretty good.
2892154	2892654	I like 1UP.
2892774	2896296	I also like... I like the ones that are just the facts.
2896436	2898178	There's no pretty picture, just the facts.
2898318	2899579	I like the media-oriented sites.
2899699	2901860	Slashdot and Dig.
2902541	2906143	And some of those ones are just, you know... If you're looking for trailers, GameTrailers.com.
2906163	2907224	Yeah, GameTrailers.com.
2907244	2909745	If you just want movies and you don't gotta pay, and it's great.
2909825	2911466	So there are all alternatives out there.
2911547	2912067	And of course,
2912671	2914452	and other independent podcasts.
2915272	2915732	Exactly.
2915852	2917673	Support your independent podcaster.
2917733	2918293	Yes, please do.
2918313	2919194	All right.
2920034	2920674	That was a good email.
2920754	2921014	Thank you.
2921635	2924516	But yeah, I have to say that voiced.
2924996	2926797	Oh, also, use Mozilla.
2928277	2931018	Use Mozilla and there's an extension you can use.
2931158	2935920	I use this to block flash, like ad block.
2936000	2939162	Search for ad block Mozilla on Google and you'll find this.
2939522	2942343	It's a thing that allows you to block
2945083	2955586	like Mozilla as it is you can right click on an image and block it from ever seeing it but Adblock takes it like one step further where you can block plugins on the page and things so you can get rid of those little quick time movies and stuff.
2955626	2956186	It's beautiful.
2956526	2956766	Love it.
2957587	2958947	I really like Firefox for that.
2958967	2972050	You just right click on it and you go to block images from I understand the websites are just trying to make their money and that's perfectly fine but at the same time there's smart ways of doing it and there's annoying ways of doing it.
2972366	2974766	Yeah, opening up IGN should not crash my computer.
2975927	2976547	Amen to that.
2977927	2978287	Anything else?
2978687	2984228	We also got another email about ThePlay2O, and actually I'm so dumb I just closed the email.
2984748	2986389	I'll try to credit you next week, I'm sorry.
2987749	2993170	About ThePlay2O, combines water play with the world of video games featuring flashing lights and sounds.
2993690	2996771	Directional water jets move characters through traps and mazes.
2997791	2997871	Um...
2998598	2999138	That's weird.
2999158	3004201	There's Pokemon, Super Mario Brothers, Donkey Kong, and in Canada only, SpongeBob SquarePants.
3005002	3015488	But after looking at this thing, though, it looks like those little toys that you used to get in the 80s that you'd push the button and it shot water up into the thing.
3015628	3017389	Now this one, it's electronic.
3017429	3018750	You control the direction on it.
3019230	3024414	This still makes me think of those things where you squish the water and try to hit the loop and put it on a pike or something.
3024434	3024494	Hmm.
3025802	3026302	Sounds weird.
3026563	3029705	I'd have to really see this thing in action, but that's really what it's making me think of.
3030566	3034729	I don't know if I want to... I don't feel like getting in the pool to just try this out.
3034749	3034969	Sorry.
3035269	3038471	But you go to play20, the letter O, dot com.
3038752	3039032	Okay.
3041474	3041974	Anything else?
3043335	3047138	Well, I do, but I think I will let somebody else talk for a moment.
3047738	3048299	Oh, no, go ahead.
3048399	3048679	Go ahead.
3048879	3049479	Do you insist?
3049560	3050200	Yeah, I insist.
3050460	3050880	Must you?
3050901	3051141	I do.
3051241	3051421	I do.
3052188	3054189	I don't have it up, so you've got the email up.
3054509	3056830	There was one that was emailed to me, right?
3057890	3060031	I thought you just accidentally closed the email box.
3060091	3060692	Oh, sorry.
3061832	3063093	I can get it up real fast here.
3063133	3063393	Sorry.
3063993	3066434	You know, I'm glad that your roommate's not in the room when you say that.
3066454	3067494	Well, it was... Shut up.
3067534	3068575	Why you guys are doing that?
3069175	3069575	Here it is.
3069855	3070196	I got it.
3070296	3071156	It was... Fine.
3073957	3075678	It was Shallon Monks.
3075818	3078139	It was a question from Steven S...
3079103	3082726	Who, by the way, has a hilarious email address, but of course I'm not going to read it on air, but it's hilarious.
3083306	3090530	It says, In Shaolin Monks, I've been playing with my friend, and every time he gets a fatality, mutality, or brutality, he gets it, and my character doesn't.
3090650	3094313	If you can help me figure this out, it would be much appreciated, because I'm about ready to give up on this game.
3095413	3099896	Hey, I played Mortal Kombat Shaolin Monks, and the fatality thing was really ticking me off, too.
3100717	3103999	Honestly, you're going to have to check that out on GameFAQ.
3104879	3107041	GameFAQSGameFacts.com
3108081	3112262	because I unfortunately do not know the answer, and I'm okay with admitting that, that I do not know the answer.
3112622	3114423	So, um, go for it.
3115083	3115623	Check that out.
3116023	3122085	And when you find out, let me know, because I want to know why I can't keep, why I can't unlock any more fatalities in that game.
3122425	3123845	I'm just being stupid or something, I don't know.
3124625	3125485	I've got a couple more.
3125505	3127746	I have, um, this week's UK releases.
3128006	3128186	Yeah.
3128706	3129786	And I've touched on a few of them.
3129806	3135828	We have, uh, Brat Angels, Combat Elite, uh, World War II Paratroopers, Driver 3, uh, uh, uh,
3138245	3161793	Heart of Empire, I'm sorry, Rome Marvel Nemesis, Rise of the Imperfects Namco Museum, Battle Collection Rengoku Tower, Purgatory, Sirius Sam 2 Spy Toy, WRC Rally Evolution, those are all on the 14th On 21st, Buzz the Music Quiz Cold War, Crash Tag Team Racing Dragon Ball Z, Budokai Tenkaichi Duel Masters, Shadow of the Code Fear, Fable, The Lost Chapters Genji, L.A.
3161833	3166295	Rush, Pokemon Emerald And as I scroll down to see if there's anything else...
3166995	3167516	Oh my god.
3168436	3170338	UFO Aftershock X3 Reunion.
3171059	3172139	Those are all coming out next week.
3172400	3173040	Alright, sounds good.
3173060	3176083	Alright, we're starting to get kind of late on the show here.
3176303	3177364	I have one last one.
3177384	3177704	One last one.
3177724	3178185	Just a quick one.
3178205	3178705	Alright, make it quick.
3179105	3183229	The Australian High Court, to our Australian listeners, hello everybody.
3184270	3185831	PlayStation mod chips are legal, guys.
3186291	3188213	You can mod the hell out of your PlayStation.
3188393	3189074	And it's all legal.
3189454	3191215	The whole thing behind that is it was...
3192236	3201105	Their decision found that PlayStation chips' functions were circumvented by mod chips to allow unauthorized games to be played are not primarily copy protection devices.
3201566	3205370	They really don't give a rat's ass whatever you play on your system as long as it's not bootlegged.
3205470	3207472	Well, have fun down under with your mod chips.
3207632	3208633	Import those games.
3208693	3210074	Have fun.
3210615	3212176	Just a few quick stories for you guys here.
3212196	3213017	We're trying to wind down here.
3213057	3215079	I do want to say one other thing about the PSP.
3216072	3216272	P-Safe P-1.1
3243164	3243745	PS3, PS4, PS5, PS6, PS7
3264128	3279019	and one of the things that they were demonstrating could be the possible evolution in the eye toy which is they actually had a demonstration where the eye toy took a picture of the person and recreated a 3D model of their head just like completely accurately
3279611	3287233	and they're just saying that this is possible that later on something like this could be used in the PS3 to actually put you in the game.
3287373	3288413	I mean... That's freaky.
3288673	3289053	It's okay.
3289173	3289634	Alright, well.
3290114	3290434	Interesting.
3291754	3292154	Anything else?
3292754	3293695	That's all I've got.
3293775	3294055	Alright.
3294375	3296195	Well, you know they've been trying to do that for years.
3296235	3298056	They had that thing with the Game Boy camera.
3298756	3299176	What was that?
3299196	3299936	What was it?
3299956	3300936	Imperfect Dark, wasn't it?
3301437	3302177	Yeah, but that was...
3303642	3305882	And they've done it for some other eye toys.
3305963	3306823	Facial skinning.
3306843	3308303	They have that for the eye toy now.
3308343	3310403	But boy, that's just like pasting your face.
3310483	3313144	But the 3D modeling and everything, that's crazy stuff.
3313184	3315204	Yeah, this is a 3D head.
3315344	3317705	I mean, this is not just some stupid mapping.
3317925	3320205	I don't want to see how fat I look in a video game, okay?
3320905	3322026	I don't need no 3D model.
3322106	3328247	I don't know what it is, but what just popped into my head is having the model taken and then for a new Rayman game, Raymanizing yourself.
3329622	3330343	That would be fun.
3330363	3332006	That'd be weird.
3332207	3333709	I love manipulation like that.
3335092	3336174	We know you like manipulating.
3337175	3337436	Rob.
3337837	3338117	Here.
3338498	3338718	What?
3340161	3340682	Just messing.
3342216	3346959	You know there was this big fan homebrew thing going on, King's Quest, brought up King's Quest earlier in the show.
3347259	3350421	King's Quest 9, every cloak has a silver lining.
3350481	3370972	Get this, they had all these volunteer people, like they had a 2,000 page script going for it, 9 chapters, 450 characters, original music, original voice acting being done for this whole thing, and a cease and desist was just laid on them this week by Vivendi Universal Games, which, you know, acquired Sierra some time ago, which Sierra made the King's Quest games.
3371536	3379258	So this Mac got put down on this, which is too bad because King's Quest is kind of one of those games where I kind of, I'm always like, I wonder whatever happened to King's Quest.
3379278	3385179	You know, I knew that there was like that eighth game that didn't really register on the radar too much, but then King's Quest kind of disappeared.
3385259	3388680	So I would have been excited to see something like this, a continuation of the story.
3389120	3394641	And what a fan community, honestly, what a community to be getting that many people involved in a project like that.
3394681	3395241	That's great.
3395341	3397682	But unfortunately, I guess when you get that many people involved,
3398066	3401607	you start to draw attention to yourself so that's too bad I guess but
3401929	3405411	Maybe they'll release it as like Queen's Trip.
3406472	3407352	There's an idea.
3408373	3410194	Queen's Journey Part 9.
3411154	3412415	Peasant's Quest.
3412715	3414836	Curse you, Trogdor!
3415737	3423821	Or, you know, maybe they could work out a deal where maybe Vivendi Universal could just distribute this game and, you know, make some money.
3423862	3427083	Download it free off of their website.
3427123	3428424	Seriously, I mean, come on.
3428484	3429785	Some people still love King's Quest.
3430205	3431326	Alright, last story, you guys.
3431346	3431506	Ready?
3433766	3437409	This is a brand new game coming out.
3437629	3439430	I don't know how else to say this.
3441031	3446935	Care Bears Catch a Star is now coming out for the PC and Macintosh.
3447575	3454260	Of course, this is coming out right before the Care Bears Big Wish movie, which is coming out on DVD October 8th.
3455101	3456782	I'm sorry, that actually would have already come out here.
3456802	3457322	So...
3458939	3461680	That is the Care Bears of the 80s.
3461980	3462680	Brand new game.
3462700	3465902	At least they haven't changed how they look like they did with Strawberry Shortcake.
3465982	3469143	My big wish is that they would just stay in the 80s.
3469363	3472244	You need the Care Bears stare, don't you?
3472304	3474025	Loki just needs a Care Bears stare.
3474285	3475345	I just don't care.
3476886	3477206	At all.
3477346	3480567	I still remember the Care Bears in Wonderland movie and that was awesome.
3481327	3482328	Hey, it's only 20 bucks.
3483468	3484489	Can't argue with that.
3486369	3487170	That's the end of the show.
3487270	3488270	Final thoughts, Loki.
3489130	3489951	I hate the Care Bears.
3490611	3491992	Final thoughts, DarkSakura?
3492833	3496416	Reject Posse icons and itchy, tasty.
3497657	3500799	My final thought is, somebody's got a case of the Mondays.
3503501	3504762	Alright, thank you guys so much.
3504782	3507744	If they really take my stapler, I'm going to set the building on fire.
