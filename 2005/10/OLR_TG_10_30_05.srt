00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:56,900
minute thing she had to go take care of so unfortunately she wasn't able to be here for

13
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:57,900
the recording.

14
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,900
That's two weeks in a row now though, we're counting.

15
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:00,900
Shame shame.

16
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:01,900
Shame shame.

17
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:05,540
No, she says hi and she'll be back next week I'm sure.

18
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:08,580
However, we do have as always the one and only Tech Masoloki.

19
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:09,580
Yep.

20
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:10,580
I'm here.

21
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:11,580
How you doing?

22
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:12,580
Good.

23
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:13,580
Good.

24
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:14,580
Good to hear.

25
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:15,580
All right.

26
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:16,580
Well, let's just get into it.

27
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:17,580
Let's talk about the games we've been playing this week.

28
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,480
That's usually how we like to start off the show by letting you guys know what's going

29
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,120
on in our gaming world.

30
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:25,760
And I noticed some of the posts on the forums say, damn, you guys like to play a lot of

31
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,560
games or you guys really seem to play a lot of games.

32
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,760
How is it that we're able to play so many games, Logie?

33
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:31,760
What do you think?

34
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,840
I don't think I play that many games, honestly, but...

35
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,840
I don't.

36
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:39,840
I mean, I play like one game a week usually, and usually you'll notice, like for example,

37
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,840
burnout.

38
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,120
I'll play it in a month at a time and then I'll get snippets of games I'll play for like

39
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:48,040
an hour or something just to try them out, that type of thing.

40
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,960
And of course, you know, things are kind of going the same pattern now.

41
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,000
It's going to get a little crazy in a couple weeks when the 360 comes out because I've

42
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,420
got four games on order, so that'll be a little interesting.

43
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:01,520
I don't know how I do, I just, there's so much coming out right now that there's just,

44
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,320
I seem to be buying at least one new game a week, and that's buying, kids, I don't get

45
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,320
a lot of this stuff for free.

46
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,040
I did get one free game thanks to Loki this week, but we don't really get the hookup or

47
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,440
anything, so we actually buy these games, so.

48
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:15,480
I do a lot of games for free, but I don't play them, to be honest.

49
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:20,680
Well, I just got Castlevania DS. I want to play that because that looks good. And I got

50
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:25,440
some more Dance Dance Revolution Xtreme 2. But they had Wallace and Gromit, Curse of

51
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,960
the Were-Rabbit, and I was like, eh, no. I'm not going to play that game.

52
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,800
Usually games based on movies aren't all that great, although there's some good ones.

53
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,120
I don't know. I can bring one in and give it away or something, I don't know.

54
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,960
Yeah, listeners will like that.

55
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:42,120
So I don't get a chance to... I picked up a couple games. I picked up Grand Theft Auto

56
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:47,040
Liberty City Stories, and I played it for like five minutes, and usually Grand Theft

57
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,800
Auto I'm just like getting right into it, and it's like, oh man, you know, I have to

58
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,920
play this game, but it seems like I've, this game feels like I've played it before, it

59
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,760
just seems like Grand Theft Auto 3 all over again, there's nothing really pulling me in

60
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,300
other than, ooh I want to try out the multiplayer, but that's it, I think I'm going to put this

61
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:07,600
game down in about like a day, and, well I was just about to ask you how your gaming

62
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,440
week was, but I suppose that's a big part of it there, is the Liberty City.

63
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,840
I'm just saying, you know, I've picked up other stuff, but yeah, it's just, it's really

64
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,960
not keeping my attention.

65
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:20,480
It's a good game, I'm assuming, because once you get into the storyline, the problem comes

66
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,400
down to, I just don't have enough time to play this stuff.

67
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:28,520
I really don't, and I don't have enough time to dedicate to Grand Theft Auto Liberty City

68
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,880
Stories because that's a game that requires a lot of time.

69
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:35,920
Same with San Andreas, I didn't even finish that game, I just didn't have enough time

70
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:36,920
to dedicate to it.

71
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,320
I got bored with it after a while.

72
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:43,100
in a while there's a great game though where you make time for it. Yeah, exactly. And that

73
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:47,840
great game is the Warriors. I love that game. So that's what you've been playing instead.

74
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:53,720
I've been playing the Warriors this week and I have to say Rockstar has really, you know,

75
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:58,960
they really did a really good job translating the movie into a game and it's really surprising

76
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:04,400
because I think this game itself, for people that don't know what the Warriors are, it's

77
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,440
It's a good game, but it's also a game that will make you want to see the movie.

78
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:11,440
Also if you've seen the movie, it's a game that you'll want to play.

79
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:16,400
After seeing and playing this game, I'm like, damn, I've got to watch this movie.

80
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,960
It's win-win I think.

81
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:22,200
A really solid game, they've really put the polish into it like they've done with Grand

82
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:26,480
Theft Auto where they have mini stuff that's in the game and just really fun stuff.

83
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:31,320
One of the things I like most about it is this kind of rumble mode type thing where

84
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,800
you go in and do quick fights.

85
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:38,800
you go through the game you unlock more fights so it starts off with one on one and then

86
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:44,240
War Party which is five on five and then I just unlocked one that's called Arming which

87
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:50,200
is nine on nine and it keeps going on with that you unlock more arenas that you can fight

88
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:55,760
in and unlock more gangs and stuff and overall the game is really fun you can pick up objects

89
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:00,360
and stuff like I was mugging a guy and I threw a trash can at his head or threw a police

90
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,840
officer through a window. I mean, it's just really fun.

91
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,240
Alright, cool. Yeah.

92
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,680
Fun's what it's all about. Is that it?

93
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,920
That's all I've been playing. I still haven't gotten a chance to play Shadow of Colossus

94
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,480
yet. It's on, like, the list.

95
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,880
I've been dying to check out that game because our forums have been very active about this

96
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,440
game and lit up, and I've heard a lot of great things about it, so I'm hoping that that can

97
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:24,440
be on my list for next week, but we'll see. It's going to be a busy November.

98
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:30,880
Well we have Battlefront 2 coming out this week, actually tomorrow, or no I should say

99
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:37,400
the first, so there's a lot of stuff and that's going to be a really awesome game.

100
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,160
My gaming week, I played a couple games this week, I actually played three games, I'm going

101
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,280
to review two of them for you. The one I did not play so much of this week, I bought this

102
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:48,800
but I haven't really sat down to any extent with this, and that's the Taito collection

103
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:54,400
that's come out recently with the bubble bobble and Rainbow Islands and elevator

104
00:05:54,400 --> 00:06:00,080
action and Rastan and all these old kicks and all these old old games that

105
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,500
were put out by Taito and of course Space Invaders is on there too so I'm

106
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,820
going to review that on next week's show because I didn't get to play it enough

107
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:09,760
this week because I was too busy with other games one of them being Soul

108
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:15,120
Calibur 3. Soul Calibur 3 I picked up this week on a whim. Soul Calibur 3 is

109
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:20,400
pretty hot I gotta say at first at first my reaction to Soul Calibur 3 was this

110
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:26,640
is really more like Soul Calibur 2.5 it doesn't really feel like that radically

111
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:30,160
different from Soul Calibur 2 at first glance because you really just have

112
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,680
pretty much the same characters and different clothing I mean granted there's

113
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,480
small changes here and there you pretty much have the same characters and

114
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:40,400
different outfits and then you know the three new ones but the game does start

115
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,640
to go really a lot deeper than that and the game has these really interesting

116
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:48,960
modes in them of course you have your challenge mode I don't remember the

117
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,800
official soul battle or something where you just you do these different types

118
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:55,600
like death match or coin collecting these weird modes but I gotta say this

119
00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:00,160
one mode that really I thought was just so fascinating was the chronicles of the

120
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,000
sword mode which is this mode that suddenly soul caliber turns into this

121
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,640
tactical game where you're moving your characters around trying to capture

122
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:11,640
castles and when you get into battles you can actually zoom to the battle and

123
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,680
actually have a real Soul Calibur style match.

124
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,720
Which I thought was a very interesting addition to the game.

125
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,600
And you kinda consider that Soul Calibur's

126
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,520
kinda been going outside the box for a little while now

127
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,440
because they had that mode in Soul Calibur 2

128
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,120
and then the conquest mode in the arcades.

129
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,300
It was really cool.

130
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,200
I'm trying to make it much more than just a fighting game

131
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,120
and I think that's really great.

132
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,400
Now if you are not a fan of fighting games,

133
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,400
is Soul Calibur 3 gonna have anything new to win you over?

134
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,560
Probably not.

135
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:43,640
I don't think if you're a fighting games person, Soul Calibur 3 is going to have anything really

136
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,640
for you.

137
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:48,180
And I think if you're not a fan of the Soul Calibur series to begin with, 3 is not going

138
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:51,100
to have anything that new that's going to bowl you over.

139
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:58,420
I mean, there's some great new modes and some new things and stuff, but I just don't think

140
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:02,060
if you are into fighting games you're going to find anything great here.

141
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:04,980
Have you played with the create a character mode?

142
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:05,980
Yes, now that was the other thing.

143
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:07,900
The create a character mode is hilarious.

144
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:11,060
Hilarious now basically create a character mode

145
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:16,620
I think is a little you don't get to create as much as you think you basically pick from one of a few

146
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:23,140
Types like you can be a ninja or an assassin or a dancer now

147
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:26,980
I have a I have a create your own character dancer who uses tambourines for a weapon

148
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:29,620
But see you don't really get to pick with the wet, you know

149
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:32,620
You don't get to pick the type of weapon, but then you design the outfits

150
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:34,420
So it's more like you're playing Barbie

151
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:37,980
So caliber Barbie style where you're choosing the different outfits and the color for the outfits

152
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:41,340
But you can still do an awful lot with that and it's kind of cool

153
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:46,480
And it makes you know, you laugh because you know, we made this one character that doesn't wear pants, but he wears a giant pope hat

154
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:52,900
Style thing and he's a ninja then it's really funny and we gave him like the old man

155
00:08:53,140 --> 00:09:00,380
Yes, he's a pantsless pope ninja and he's awesome. So, you know, you can have fun with it. And it's it's it's a it's a cute idea

156
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:06,740
of course I miss having cool characters like link and spawn but you know that's

157
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:10,240
the creative character thing more than makes up for it it's a pretty funny mode

158
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,420
and it leaves a lot to achieve in the game because there's a lot of stuff to

159
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:18,200
unlock a lot of outfits and you unlock stuff fast in this game too probably

160
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,160
within the first 15 minutes of me playing Soulcalibur 3 I had three

161
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:26,000
characters three new characters unlocked so I think it's kind of neat so I do

162
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,260
recommend Soulcalibur 3 I think it's a very solid great game honestly if you're

163
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:33,120
a fan of Soul Calibur you probably already have this game and if you don't

164
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,860
already have it you need to go get it because if you remotely enjoyed the

165
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:40,020
previous Soul Calibur games especially Soul Calibur 2 you will enjoy Soul

166
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:43,360
Calibur 3. I'm just a little upset that they didn't put it in the arcades I

167
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,580
think it would have been a great arcade game but maybe because all the new stuff

168
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:50,560
is very centered around the single-player mode I think if you take

169
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,300
just the versus mode without create a character there's really not a whole lot

170
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:59,260
different from Soul Calibur 2 save three new characters and some backgrounds so I

171
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:02,980
I think it is something that and now and now having played it on the console

172
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:07,260
I think this is something that they really you know, there would be no point pointing it to the arcade

173
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:11,620
But I don't know. I just I'm just a little disappointed to see that it didn't continue in the arcade

174
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:17,260
the other game I checked out this week was midday Midway arcade treasures part 3 for the

175
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,980
Xbox was the system I played it on

176
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:30,220
um eight racing games including stun runner hydro thunder off-road uh off-road thunder that's what

177
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:34,300
i'm thinking of and then like iron man's off-road but they took iron man out and now it's just some

178
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:40,860
regular guy because i guess licensing ran up or whatever um the reason why i was so drawn to this

179
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:45,740
game and i was so excited to play this game was for iron man off-road because i have very fond

180
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:50,700
memories of dumping a shitload of quarters into a pizzeria arcade machine

181
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,480
and just playing this game over and over again and they even have the track pack

182
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:59,720
one which I think is awesome so I was I was loving it it's cool it's a retro

183
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:03,340
trip I mean you kind of know how you feel about those retro collections if

184
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:05,860
you kind of find them a waste of money then you're probably not going to get

185
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:09,720
anything new out of this I was a little disappointed at first it's nothing but

186
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:13,340
the racing games but when you consider the Midways kind of already packaged all

187
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:18,020
their other stuff, and put it in Treasures 1 and 2, which were both very solid collections.

188
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:23,220
This collections, you know, they made pretty good use out of what they got left.

189
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:27,980
Now, I was a little disappointed though, because Hydro Thunder and Off-Road Thunder do not

190
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:34,060
appear to be arcade ports, or if they are, they sure don't play like them, they feel

191
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:36,980
very console-ish, I think they're ports of the console versions, I don't think they're

192
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:41,500
ports of the arcade, which was a little bit disappointing, and I don't know if maybe the

193
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,740
hardware can handle it, but...

194
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:47,740
Well, it should be able to. I remember the hardware versions. I used to love Off-Road Thunder.

195
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:50,740
That was my game to play at, like, Cuzar and stuff.

196
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:55,740
And it looked amazing. It looked pretty good. But yeah, I can imagine.

197
00:11:55,740 --> 00:12:01,740
I don't think they're straight arcade ports. Or if they are, they tweaked them so they don't really feel like the arcade.

198
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:08,740
So I was a little sad at that, but it's still a pretty solid buy for $20.

199
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:13,140
if you like racing games you're gonna love this otherwise and it's in that

200
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:17,260
same great interface that they have part two in and I think they went back and

201
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:21,780
updated part one with but part two's got a great interface and three just kind of

202
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:24,980
continues that if it's not broke don't fix it Xbox Live aware and all that good

203
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:30,580
stuff if you're on Xbox so I I would I kind of borderline recommend it I think

204
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:36,900
that treasures 2 and treasures 1 are more must-haves than treasures 3 but if

205
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:42,100
If you like these old retro collections, you definitely want to pick up Treasures 3.

206
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,260
It's a good buy for 20 bucks, you can't go wrong.

207
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:47,080
So I give it kind of, if you're a retro fan, I recommend it.

208
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:50,380
If you're not so much a retro fan, I can only really give it a borderline recommendation

209
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:55,020
because it's just, it's a very focused genre and it kind of gets old, I think, if you're

210
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:56,020
not into it.

211
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:59,580
So, all right, so those are two games and then next week I'll talk about Taito.

212
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:01,060
Let's get into some gaming news, shall we?

213
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:02,060
Shall we?

214
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:04,700
We'll talk about some news going on.

215
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:08,700
Florida is going to follow the footsteps of California, supposedly, because a violent

216
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:11,700
video game bill has been proposed in Florida now.

217
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:15,380
However, there's a little bit of a difference there.

218
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:22,740
Florida's proposal also includes violent arcade games and shop-selling arcade machines, and

219
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:26,300
not just the retail over-the-counter ones, which I think is very interesting.

220
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,820
Ehhhh, that's retarded.

221
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,620
Well, how so?

222
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:35,460
I mean, I can't sell this violent arcade game to a minor.

223
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:36,460
Is that what it's gonna be?

224
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:39,660
I know, I guess, but what do you do about little kids walking into an arcade?

225
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:44,980
I mean, I don't think the bill is really set to cover that, but, I mean, Mortal Kombat,

226
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:47,340
I saw it like, you know, 15 and it was awesome.

227
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:51,740
It's not that violent, I mean, I don't know, it's...

228
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:54,300
You remember the big stink they raised about Mortal Kombat though.

229
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:59,460
Yeah, and I never got it then, I didn't get it now, so, I mean, it's just retarded.

230
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:02,740
just thought we'd let you know it teaches people how to rip spines off of

231
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:07,560
people I don't think which reminds me I have a message for Jack Thompson if he's

232
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,820
listening which he probably is not but you know this whole debacle going around

233
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:15,020
with Jack Thompson and even this week the Seattle Police basically said you

234
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:19,300
know what this is more of a civil issue we're not gonna really go here which it

235
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:23,500
really isn't a big surprise but I have a message for Jack Thompson I'm seriously

236
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:31,060
go see Saw 2 and and focus your energies on things like that because that's

237
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:36,980
that's real violent that kind of stuff video games are cartoons compared to

238
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:43,180
that movie I want to see that movie I all kidding aside I mean obviously the

239
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:47,460
issue is you know movies are rated R and and you you're warned about it and maybe

240
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:51,660
he feels that video games aren't so well rated although I seem to recall ratings

241
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:57,580
on the bottom of every video game but seriously the movies the movies can be

242
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:03,580
way worse you guys that's my opinion Liberty City Stories of course look you

243
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:06,440
brought that up earlier in the show and you know that the custom soundtrack

244
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:10,340
option is is usually locked out like you can't really get to it in the game

245
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:15,480
however Rockstar Games is now offering for download a Rockstar custom tracks

246
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:20,300
program that will allow you to rip tracks off commercial music CDs and put

247
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:25,300
them into your custom soundtracks for Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories.

248
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:28,580
The interesting thing about this, though, is that it won't recognize stuff you bought

249
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:34,060
off iTunes, which kind of sucks, and it will not rip music from CD-Rs.

250
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:36,580
Yes, it will.

251
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:41,500
Well, they say that you can't rip music from CD-Rs.

252
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:44,800
They say that you can't, but you can.

253
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:51,100
people do is they either, like for example, if you have iTunes, burn a CD and you can

254
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:56,120
either do it that way and burn a CD and then rip it that way. Or if you have other tracks

255
00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:01,320
that won't rip for whatever reason, you use your CD burning software to create a disc

256
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:05,960
image and you open that image in a program like Daemon Tools that creates a virtual CD

257
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:12,120
ROM and you can do it that way. Wow. That's a long way to go about doing it. And the thing

258
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:16,800
about the custom tracks though it's not like its own radio station like in the PC version

259
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:22,440
or something. You actually it will play like a CD player so instead of switching stations

260
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:27,680
you're switching tracks. So it's not like you know you get in a car and you can have

261
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:33,240
your own custom station which kind of sucks but I don't know. Interesting. Well Blizzcon

262
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:37,400
was going on this past weekend and if you went to Blizzcon I didn't because I didn't

263
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:41,280
really get into the Warcraft thing until just a couple weeks ago. I'm not in the Warcraft

264
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:46,600
Well, I mean, it's not that I hadn't played Diablo II and Warcraft II.

265
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,480
I never really did get into StarCraft, though.

266
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,480
I don't know.

267
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,760
I somehow just completely missed the boat on that one.

268
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,600
But as far as Warcraft II goes, I just sucked at it.

269
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,000
I sucked at it.

270
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,540
And Diablo, I played for a little while and then kind of gave up on.

271
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:03,240
So I'm just now kind of going back to the Blizzard stuff.

272
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,280
Of course, BlizzCon, very well attended.

273
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,280
Lots of people there.

274
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,960
Lots of stories from BlizzCon.

275
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:14,320
And they are saying that they are going to be testing a new game, and if you use the

276
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:18,720
I guess number on the back of your Blizzcon pass, you can go to a website and sign up

277
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,160
to beta test a new game.

278
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,760
But they won't say what the game is.

279
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:26,160
Is it a new Diablo game?

280
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,820
Is it a WoW expansion or something?

281
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:34,420
Or is it possibly Starcraft Ghost, although I think that's already on its way.

282
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:35,420
So I don't know.

283
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:38,500
So we don't know what it's going to be.

284
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:43,100
But I imagine all those Blizzard fanboys and girls will be signing up in droves.

285
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:48,660
Anyway, also speaking of World of Warcraft, we definitely, definitely have to mention

286
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:53,300
the Burning Crusade, the new expansion that was mentioned this week for World of Warcraft.

287
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,600
They're going to be upping the level cap to 70.

288
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,700
Two brand new playable races, Blood Elves on the Horde side.

289
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:03,420
And although they won't say what it is on the Alliance side, we're hearing buzz that

290
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:08,820
it's pandarens but take that with a grain of salt but blood elves is the

291
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:14,420
for sure one some new starting zones and you can go through the dark portal which

292
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:19,520
is a reference to the Warcraft 2 expansions new flying mounts you know

293
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:24,580
like instead of riding a horse I guess they fly now and tons of new quests and

294
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:28,820
tons of new items and jewel crafting a new profession because you're gonna have

295
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:32,660
socketed items now which is kind of something borrowed from Diablo but if

296
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:37,060
think about it, World of Warcraft pretty much plays like a Diablo game anyway, so that's

297
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:38,740
not too big of a surprise.

298
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:43,220
So I'm sure a lot of you folks that are into Warcraft are very excited about that expansion.

299
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,560
I would be too.

300
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,780
So I'm definitely going to pick this up.

301
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:47,780
It'll be exciting.

302
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:48,780
Yeah.

303
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,780
Alright, Loki, you got something for us?

304
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:51,780
Yeah.

305
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:57,540
Well, first thing I'm looking at is screenshots from the Matrix Path of Neo, which is coming

306
00:18:57,540 --> 00:19:00,740
out in a couple weeks, and that looks damn sexy.

307
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:07,840
You know, a lot of people panned the previous game, Enter the Matrix, I didn't think it

308
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:08,840
was that bad.

309
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:14,760
I thought it was a really neat idea, how they really made it a continuation of the movies,

310
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:21,160
and even if the movies 2 and 3 sucked, it was a neat continuation idea, like it really

311
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,920
fused the whole movies and games thing.

312
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:26,440
I got to give them a lot of credit for that, and the game itself was not that bad.

313
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,000
It wasn't bad at all.

314
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,500
I thought it was kind of neat.

315
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,180
It was fun, it was tough.

316
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:37,140
This one looks really bad ass and the graphics really stepped it up a bit, but anyways, that's

317
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:39,860
not what I had.

318
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:45,180
The first thing I wanted to mention actually, there's been a whole lot of, you know, especially

319
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:50,800
with the upcoming systems now, a whole bunch of speculation on dates and stuff.

320
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:55,760
One of the things that was reported this week is that it's been confirmed by a couple places

321
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:02,000
is that the release for the revolution is going to be June 2006, which ties in both

322
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:09,620
it's the beginning of the new financial year for Nintendo, and it's also been confirmed

323
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:14,480
by some other hardware sources, people are doing the chip manufacturing and stuff.

324
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,240
So that would be interesting, but the price point, though, is kind of up in the air.

325
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:23,280
But that doesn't mean that EB Games can't put a pre-order thing on their site.

326
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:33,840
So I believe the price point is, right now they have Zelda Revolution, which is not even

327
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,280
confirmed to be an actual game that's even in existence.

328
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,840
Even if it was in existence, they're not going to release it two months after...

329
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:47,360
Oh my gosh, I'm so embarrassed, I can't remember the name of the new Zelda game all of a sudden.

330
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,360
You mean Twilight Princess?

331
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:51,360
Yes, Twilight Princess, oh my god.

332
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,160
I just lost major nerd points there.

333
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,200
They're not going to release it two months after Twilight Princess.

334
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,700
I'll put it this way, okay?

335
00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:00,040
First off, there is no Zelda Revolution, at least not anything that's coming out next

336
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,160
year at all.

337
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:08,200
What it's going to be is it's going to be just Zelda Twilight Princess with Revolution

338
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,200
support.

339
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,080
They're going to have added support added into the game, so if you have Revolution you

340
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,080
can do funky stuff and stuff.

341
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:16,560
Right, I like the old Game Boy, Oracle of Seasons and stuff, that sort of thing.

342
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,560
Yeah, stuff like that.

343
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:25,960
But, what you can do is you can actually pre-order some stuff with your Revolution in a bundle.

344
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:32,680
Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles, Mario Revolution, Metroid Prime 3, Super Smash Bros. Revolution,

345
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:36,360
and you can reserve those for $240.

346
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:40,560
Which is interesting seeing as none of those games are even confirmed to exist.

347
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,560
I know, that's kind of weird.

348
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,560
They're just trying to get people to agree with it.

349
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:48,440
That's like saying, ah, I want to pre-order Grand Theft Auto 5.

350
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:54,520
But the other thing, which was very interesting, is the PlayStation 3.

351
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:59,280
And there's been a lot of, you know, when's this thing coming out 2?

352
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:04,360
And now there's a rumor going around that's saying that it's not going to be until 2007,

353
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,360
and because they had some...

354
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,360
No, they wouldn't.

355
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,360
That would be crazy.

356
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,440
2007 do the hardware failures because apparently the system

357
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:14,280
you know all a normal PlayStation 2 and

358
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,640
PlayStation they get a little hot

359
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,640
Wow

360
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:25,560
That would really stink if they push that back to 2007. That would be oh, but of course

361
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:32,040
This is you know a friend of you know, I heard it from somebody who for some way out and that's that's crap then so

362
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:36,520
yeah it's very interesting stuff though

363
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,280
I'm glad you have some news about the

364
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,700
other consoles because a lot of people

365
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:42,040
are still like OMG Xbox 360 so it's nice

366
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,040
to see what the other guys are up to

367
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,600
right now because I'll tell you what if

368
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,920
that room somebody brought this up on

369
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,520
our three-hour program this week where

370
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,160
they're saying that you're not going to

371
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:52,480
be able to get a plus package the

372
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,820
$400 one unless you pre-ordered it if

373
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:56,040
that turns out to be true I'm gonna be

374
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:58,480
so mad. Most of them were made so mad. Most of

375
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:03,480
of the boxes going out were the Xbox 360 system,

376
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:07,000
not the core system, and so they didn't really make

377
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,400
that many to begin with, and I don't think that they're,

378
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,040
it's all based on pre-orders, so these stores,

379
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:14,440
you know, if they ordered that many core systems

380
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,220
to come in, then that's what they're getting,

381
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:18,160
but it's not gonna be like, we wanted to bring in

382
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,960
some systems, here's some core systems instead,

383
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,320
because, you know, that'd be like,

384
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,280
that'd be like going to your store, you know,

385
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,440
and oh, I'm gonna be selling a bunch of Pentium 4 PCs,

386
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:32,160
Oh, sorry, we sent you Pentium 3 PCs, you know, deal.

387
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,000
So that's not gonna happen.

388
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,520
You know how I feel about pre-ordering

389
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,020
and I have this really hard idea

390
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:39,160
believing that they would put off major retailers

391
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,760
like Toys R Us and Best Buy

392
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,840
by shafting them with just the $300.

393
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:46,320
Best Buy is only getting about 50 per store.

394
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,140
That is it.

395
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:50,120
So you're gonna have some major trouble finding one

396
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,480
launch day.

397
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:54,480
I really am saying it's gonna be short-handed

398
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:59,480
and as it is, eBay, they're already up to $480 to $600

399
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:04,640
for guaranteed getting them on launch day, free books, so.

400
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:06,960
Crazy.

401
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:07,800
Crazy.

402
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:10,600
I'm gonna be pissed if that happens.

403
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:13,000
Watch me, I will rant on this program.

404
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:13,840
Anyway.

405
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:16,360
I better get mine.

406
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,760
It's paid for completely, so.

407
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:21,040
All right, moving on.

408
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,200
Let's go to the mailbox because I went ahead

409
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,560
open up the mailbox this week. I know this is usually DarkSakura's task, but she gave

410
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:33,320
me permission to open up the mailbox this week. Read some emails sent at togo at orangelaunchradio.com

411
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:40,720
is our mailbox. So let's open up the mailbag and see what's going on. We have an email

412
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:46,380
from Dallas, who actually lives in Salt Lake City, and Dallas wrote us to tell us that

413
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:49,880
they were listening to the last podcast, and we mentioned about the congressional bill

414
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:56,920
about how all TVs must be digital, or TV stations need to be broadcast only in digital by 2008.

415
00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:00,060
Digital is not the same as HD, is what Dallas wants to clarify.

416
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:04,420
So all TVs by 2008 need to be able to receive a digital signal.

417
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:08,680
It doesn't mean the TVs need to receive an HD signal, which is completely different.

418
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:12,480
And basically, any TV can receive a digital signal with a converter from Radio Shack.

419
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,080
And if you already get digital cable or satellite, then you're already set.

420
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:21,520
In fact, all current game consoles are digital, so all next-gen consoles will be digital as

421
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,520
well.

422
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:25,960
But it seems only the 360 and PS3 will have HD capabilities.

423
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:28,000
HD is a completely different monster.

424
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,620
I used to have this misperception with digital and HD was the same thing, and I think many

425
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:33,560
people have the same misperception.

426
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,040
Hope that clarifies things.

427
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:38,780
I thought they were broadcasting HD, I thought everything was going HD.

428
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:43,040
I was under that misimpression too, that I thought it wasn't so much that I misunderstood

429
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,320
that there was a difference between digital and HD.

430
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,760
I thought that the bill was telling them they'd have to do HD.

431
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:52,140
I thought it was supposed to be HD because everything is going into that format now.

432
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:53,420
It's going to be all widescreen.

433
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:55,680
It's what everything is going into.

434
00:25:55,680 --> 00:26:03,080
That's why, because older TVs can't support that, but hey, more power to you if it's just

435
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,080
digital.

436
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,840
Honestly, if you're going to go to the next step with your TV any time in the next few

437
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:12,280
years, you ought to just get an HD anyway, because they're getting more and more affordable.

438
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:18,200
I've mentioned to a few of my friends, I'm modifying my cabinet, my MAME cabinet at home

439
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:23,020
to support HD, in other words I'm ripping the top off of it so I can put a widescreen

440
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:24,020
TV in there.

441
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:25,020
Awesome.

442
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,020
Yeah.

443
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:27,020
Good luck with that.

444
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:28,020
Alright, let's go to another email.

445
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:32,340
This is from one of our serial emailers, Rob, but we like him, he always has a lot of good

446
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,340
stuff to say.

447
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:37,540
He wants to give us a useless bit of trivia for the game Grip Shift.

448
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:41,500
actually an easter egg if you watch the credits of grip shift all the way

449
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:47,220
through you get a recipe at the end that's kind of cool what's the recipe

450
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:51,100
for it didn't say in the email but I think it's on our forums so go check out

451
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:56,980
the forums all right and last up we got an email from Polly and this actually

452
00:26:56,980 --> 00:27:01,700
relates to something that's going on in the news right now I did the ultra mix

453
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:07,360
three and extreme two and karaoke revolution tour the DDR and karaoke

454
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:11,440
revolution tour that's going on in some of the malls poly wrote us because he

455
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:15,880
wants to say that he actually went and I want to describe the setup a little bit

456
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:19,940
it was a small stage set up with DDR extreme to set up southwest of the stage

457
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:24,120
and Ultramix 3 set up south southeast unfortunately they didn't have

458
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:28,480
metal pads just the official sticky pads ex2 and the Ultramix 3 have a bunch of

459
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:34,480
Although Xtreme 2 seems to stick to the DDR feel and UltraMix 3 seems to have a bigger variety to me,

460
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,480
both seem like good games to get for DDR Bamani fans.

461
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:41,480
The stage itself had a single softpad and kiosk for Karaoke Revolution,

462
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:44,480
where you could choose to sing a song solo, duet, or sing and dance.

463
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,480
The list of songs to sing was alright, I think. Wish there were more.

464
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:52,480
After singing on stage, you got the promised CD recording of yourself and a Karaoke Revolution t-shirt,

465
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:57,480
but the guy said, um, set it up weird so the recording turned up really awful, he said.

466
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:03,200
said. Other free things that he got included the Xtreme 2 and UltraMix 3 v-rare samplers

467
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:08,720
and the DDR t-shirt. The t-shirts are white and ash, white for DDR, ash for Karaoke Revolution,

468
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:15,000
and have the logos on the front. Very interesting. Also says at the end here, but for the lucky

469
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,880

Anyway, check that out and OLRPSP.com again is really meant for your PSP.

491
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:30,340
I mean, you can bring it up in Internet Explorer or Firefox, but it's just not as cool.

492
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:31,820
Trust me, bring it up on your PSP.

493
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:34,340
It's awesome looking.

494
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:39,460
So you know the big tour that's going around the country or, well, I'm going to be using

495
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:44,600
past tense terms pretty soon, Video Games Live, the one that was being co-produced by

496
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:49,880
Tommy Tallarico G4 TV personality and composer of music for certain games it

497
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:55,280
got cancelled the whole damn thing got cancelled except for well they do you

498
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:58,220
know a couple show they did they ended up doing the shows and I think Spokane

499
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:02,220
and Vancouver but they cancelled all the rest or at least you know they say well

500
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:07,420
they kind of may be postponing them to 2006 but bottom story long story short

501
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:10,820
you got to go back get your tickets refunded and guess what that ticket

502
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:18,980
master handling fee non-refundable you got screwed out of 450 yeah I I think

503
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:22,460
this is really weird though because I seem to remember that they made this big

504
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:26,180
hubble ooh about postponing the dates and I bet if we went in the older

505
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:29,780
podcast we find where we were talking about this even where they were adding

506
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:34,260
more dates because of demand and now they're saying they're canceling them

507
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:38,460
because they thought more people would be supportive of the concept and there

508
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:41,220
just wasn't enough interest generated in these shows I think they really

509
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:49,860
underestimated how much people hate Tommy Tarlet you're mean but I I was

510
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:52,780
turned off by the fact they said they were gonna play music from like pong and

511
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:58,460
Donkey Kong and I'm sitting here going what I mean it's no music in pong I it

512
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:04,060
was supposed to be inspired by pong or so that's crap yeah that's a bunch of

513
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:07,060
maybe maybe I'm maybe I'm just reading rumors or something I don't want to get

514
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:10,020
like quoted or nasty emails and stuff but seriously they were talking about

515
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:14,740
playing music from these old old old 80s games that had no music I know that like

516
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:18,140
Donkey Kong or something was on there and I'm just thinking what now some of

517
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:20,940
the other stuff might have been cool like Metal Gear Solid and stuff but I

518
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:27,340
bet Squeenix is pointing and laughing going dear friends was a big success

519
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:32,500
more friends plagued with sound problems and got panned by the video game

520
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:35,220
community because we didn't know how to put on a show at the Hollywood

521
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:39,020
empathy or wherever the hell that thing was we went to universal thing but

522
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:42,300
at least that place was sold out

523
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:46,660
with their exploding sound board

524
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:50,100
yeah you know it was so cool because they'd have like the one wing angel and

525
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:54,500
out come the black mages you know doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo

526
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:54,920
and then

527
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:59,300
like this random wood thing falling

528
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:05,160
that was awful you know we like to talk about video games and movie

529
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:11,160
and vice versa. Clock Tower 3 is going to have a film made out of it. Script writer

530
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:20,160
Todd Farmer, who by the way wrote Jason X a few years ago, oh wow, has been approached

531
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:23,920
by the Mayhem Project to helm an adaptation of Clock Tower 3.

532
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:30,160
I have full faith in him now. Jason X was awesome. No granted though, if anyone's going

533
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:35,040
to pull off a Jason in space movie, it would be him I guess.

534
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:41,040
Dewey Ball is going to split the Dungeon Siege movie, Kill Bill style.

535
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,040
Very interesting.

536
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:45,440
This movie is going to be like four hours long, so they're splitting it into two parts.

537
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:49,180
You want to know how long originally this movie is supposed to be?

538
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:55,360
He said that it was basically the original script, and the script that he apparently

539
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:59,360
is going by right now is 485 pages long.

540
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,360
So...

541
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,360
Hold on.

542
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,360
Huh?

543
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,360
Huh?

544
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,360
Huh?

545
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,360
Lord of the Rings ripoff!

546
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:10,840
Okay, 485 pages long, and you know in scriptwriting, each page is supposed to be about an 8 hour

547
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:11,840
long movie.

548
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,640
Oh my God.

549
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:20,040
So I guess the first part is going to be called In the Name of the King, and it will be out

550
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:25,760
November 3rd, 2006, but then the conclusion will be out December 1st, 2006, but it's going

551
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,660
to be like one month in between.

552
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:32,460
I'm willing to give it a chance, but I'm kind of like, is this only getting made because

553
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:33,460
of Lord of the Rings?

554
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:36,340
Is it going to be a subpar clone?

555
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:37,660
Was it BloodRayne?

556
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:39,740
The reviews before have been horrible.

557
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:40,740
Horrible.

558
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:45,040
Alright, let's talk about something cool.

559
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,320
Let's talk about Starship Troopers.

560
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,640
Now that was a cool movie.

561
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:50,140
Well Starship Troopers is being, I think it was a cool movie.

562
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:51,140
It was okay.

563
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:54,420
It was cheesy, but it was good.

564
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:57,140
It's being turned into a PC game.

565
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:59,140
You're not supposed to be turned into a PC game like a long-ass.

566
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:01,140
Well, it's finally happening.

567
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:06,140
It's coming out in, it went in gold, and it's coming out here in November.

568
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:12,140
In 2000, I guess in 2000 they had a first Starship Troopers base game,

569
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:19,140
but this is a new one that is basically doing a first-person perspective type thing.

570
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,140
Interesting.

571
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:24,140
Caspar Van Diem, by the way, who is in the film, will be doing voiceover commentary in the game.

572
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:25,140
Because he doesn't get any work.

573
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:32,980
that's right any other news for us Loki oh let me see yeah um yeah I know of

574
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:39,500
course there's stuff the first being stuff for the PSP of course the big

575
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:46,620
thing that everybody's been you know up in arms about is the brand new actually

576
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:51,060
well for example SOCOM they have voice chat in it so now they are going to be

577
00:34:51,060 --> 00:35:00,020
offering pretty soon a headset for chatting via the game over the internet just like you

578
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:06,340
would with anybody else playing SOCOM on your PS2 or what not.

579
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:10,580
So that's going to be coming out pretty soon which is kind of cool.

580
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:18,660
The other thing was they were talking a little bit on the Resident Evil DS stuff which looks

581
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:28,460
really weird. I'm always kind of concerned with the quirky gameplay of the DS with Resident

582
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:31,740
Evil. I'm just not seeing it.

583
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:40,820
Resident Evil Deadly Silence. Damn you people and your DS. God, every freaking franchise

584
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:46,900
that's gone over to DS had to be like Drill Spirits or Dawn of Sorrow. It's like, God,

585
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:51,300
We get it, it's a DS game.

586
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:56,280
It's coming out, by the way, in mid-January in Japan, but I'm sure we'll get it here.

587
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,280
Of course.

588
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,780
Of course, touch screens, features, and controls and stuff.

589
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:03,500
You know it's actually a remake of the original Resident Evil, but they just, you know, they

590
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:04,780
changed a whole bunch.

591
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:08,300
How many times have they remade the original Resident Evil now?

592
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,300
Too many.

593
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:13,380
What about the great voice acting?

594
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,380
when I end up in a Jill's sandwich.

595
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:20,380
I don't think that'd be so bad.

596
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:26,760
Anyways, really the other big thing that was coming out actually is the add-on for Half

597
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:35,260
Life 2, Lost Coast, and it's actually available now via Steam, which is definitely the way

598
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:36,260
you can download it.

599
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:43,020
It supposedly has some graphical updates to it, new volumetric lighting, and just overall

600
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:47,080
you know half-life 2 sexy so that's all you really need to know the other big

601
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:53,940
the other big thing actually if games coming out would be thq's lineup for the

602
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:58,280
360 and everybody's like you know looking forward to Saints Row which is

603
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:01,240
supposed to be the Grand Theft Auto or one of the Grand Theft Auto games now

604
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:06,920
for the 360 oh yeah another one yeah too bad you know what I think you'll see

605
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:11,000
this game about the same time you'll see a PlayStation 3 and that would be in

606
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,040
two thousand seven so i keep on waiting

607
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:19,120
uh... and also the other game the outfit uh... won't be seen till two thousand

608
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:23,020
six but i could've told you that

609
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:26,120
why am i getting so upset about not being able to get an xbox three sixty on

610
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:29,600
launch day because there's gonna be no freaking games at home. All your launch titles are

611
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,920
coming out in november

612
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:33,660
uh... you're not going to be seeing anything new until

613
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:36,640
january and so far everything that's been announced for january

614
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,160
the godfather

615
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:42,120
which is uh... one of the games is coming out and i believe uh... there's

616
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:44,560
another game that was pushed back to that date

617
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,100
of nba uh...

618
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:49,620
or college hoops two thousand six the uh...

619
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:50,880
elder scrolls

620
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:55,120
elder scrolls is in december the first week of december so we do get a december game

621
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:58,400
it's going to be awesome but um...

622
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,880
you know it's really sad that uh... this is everything that's come out it's going

623
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:05,120
to be you know ds psp syndrome you know where

624
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:08,200
the system launches with a ton of tiles and then you're like, okay, wow, all those games

625
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,200
are cool.

626
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,600
What do you got for me next?

627
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,600
We got nothing.

628
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:16,080
Maybe, now I'm starting to reconsider if I really need to buy into this hype on the launch.

629
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:21,000
Buy Second Wave is coming out first, second week in January.

630
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
That's when you can get your 360.

631
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
We'll see.

632
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
I'll think about it.

633
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,640
I'll think about it.

634
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:31,920
News on Final Fantasy 3DS, of course, from MeToo Magazine, which always seems to get

635
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:35,080
a lot of great news on the games first.

636
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:37,840
Basically what happened is that they were kind of talking about why the game took so

637
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:43,920
long to be redone and what it is is that, well it used to be, it was first a Famicom

638
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:47,800
game and it was only developed by a really small team of people.

639
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:51,720
However, Final Fantasy 3 used some complicated programming techniques that really couldn't

640
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:55,300
be ported to a handheld gaming machine until now.

641
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:58,240
So what they did is since it went so long without an upgrade, they decided to do some

642
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:01,200
graphical upgrades for Final Fantasy 3.

643
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:05,040
Not to be confused you guys with the American Final Fantasy 3 which was actually Final Fantasy

644
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:09,880
Okay, they're gonna remake the Japanese Final Fantasy 3 and call it Final Fantasy 3 on the

645
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:10,880
DS.

646
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:14,040
It's gonna have sort of 3D graphics.

647
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:18,240
It's gonna be like virtual 3D graphics, so you can't really like rotate the maps on demand

648
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:21,800
or anything, but you can still like zoom in and out and stuff, and they're gonna redo

649
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:25,760
the characters and some of the technology and they will incorporate a little bit of

650
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,240
touch screen into it.

651
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:30,880
Think 3D as in Final Fantasy 7.

652
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:35,480
also in the original Nintendo one the four main characters really didn't have

653
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:39,600
any personalities but in the DS remake they are going to get some new

654
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:43,240
personalities that are going to impact the storyline so it's basically going to

655
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:49,600
be this whole new game it sounds like so should be fun awesome I'm definitely

656
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:55,360
gonna pick that up also I gotta say it's one more they there will be wireless

657
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:57,880
capability

658
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:01,560
but it's going to be, they won't say how, but it's going to use the wireless

659
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:04,480
capability for some sort of bonus

660
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,060
interesting

661
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:08,280
couple last news stories for you guys tonight

662
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:12,720
unless you have anything else, Loki? I have stuff, of course. Then finish up

663
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:16,480
because all I've got left is the funny stuff. Okay, okay, well the first

664
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:19,320
thing I've got and this is kind of cool

665
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:24,200
if you're a fan of, you know, playing the old arcade games and you

666
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:28,920
thinking about getting a MAME cabinet, well think no further. All you have to do now is

667
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:33,940
go to your local Target. That's right, Target's going to be selling stand-up arcade machines

668
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:41,280
starting in November. The 62-inch tall arcade cabinets featuring midway games such as Joust,

669
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:49,240
Rampage, Defender, and Root Beer Tapper will be available under $500. And that's pretty

670
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:54,440
pretty interesting. You know what, kids? Just spend forty bucks on arcade treasures one

671
00:40:54,440 --> 00:41:00,580
and two. Or spend sixty and get one, two, and three. And just tilt your TV a little

672
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:06,280
bit and maybe spend another twenty dollars on an arcade style joystick in your set.

673
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:12,360
And in news that I'd like to classify as no shit, the Zelda 3 game that was available

674
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:22,120
on eBay, yeah that was fake. Not the real Zelda 3 game. So yeah, that's kind of interesting.

675
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:30,600
And then finally, I don't know why, but Pac-Man and Pac-Man World 3 is giving his own voice.

676
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:38,820
Who will be voicing him? But Martin T. Sherman, who had voiced such games as Driver 3, Second

677
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:43,440
site. Oh wow, what an impressive resume. And TimeSplitters Future Perfect, which by the

678
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:50,600
way is a very underrated game. But really awesome, and personally I think Pac-Man World

679
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:55,960
3 is going to suck, but anyways. So why did you say it was really awesome? I don't know.

680
00:41:55,960 --> 00:42:01,600
I was... You were still thinking about TimeSplitters? I was still thinking about it, exactly. Alright,

681
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:06,880
I have a couple WTF stories for you guys.

682
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:10,140
Tamagotchi DS, I think we reported on this a few months ago.

683
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:14,140
We talked about Tamagotchi Corner Store, which was coming out in Japan.

684
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:15,860
Guess what?

685
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:17,800
It's coming out in the US.

686
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,480
They are going to bring this game out in the US.

687
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:21,280
Guess when it's coming out?

688
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,740
This fall.

689
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:25,360
Like soon, very soon.

690
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:28,240
So I guess secretly this whole time they're reporting it to the US.

691
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:33,740
So it is coming out here and they're saying that the original Tamagotchi struck a chord

692
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:38,140
with kids who wanted a toy that complimented their active lifestyle and these virtual pets

693
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:40,320
were the perfect answer.

694
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:43,780
Tamagotchi provides the nurturing play pattern with the electronic component and portability

695
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:47,000
that allows kids to take the toy with them wherever they go.

696
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:52,660
This coming from Rain Rice of the Toy Industry Association.

697
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:57,100
Now what I do think is kind of cool about this is that it is actually being designed

698
00:42:57,100 --> 00:43:01,200
by Nana Oncha, who made Parappa the Rapper.

699
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:06,440
So I'm not completely laughing at this game just yet, because it's Tamagotchi related,

700
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:12,280
because you know, Parappa changed, you know, Parappa provided, you could say we would not

701
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:15,120
have music games today if it weren't for Parappa.

702
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:16,120
You could say that, I don't know.

703
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:17,720
Can I mention one more thing here?

704
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:18,720
Oh sure.

705
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:22,220
One of the things that I was really pissed off about was the backwards compatibility

706
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:23,220
with the 360.

707
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:25,720
And I was like, why is it only supporting 20 games?

708
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:26,720
That's retarded.

709
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:27,720
What?

710
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:29,840
I didn't hear that they finally said it was only going to support 20 games.

711
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:33,960
Well that's initially what they threw out there about the first week of course, then

712
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:36,800
each week there's more and more support it.

713
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:42,040
But one of the reasons they're doing this is like for example games like Halo 2, they're

714
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:47,200
going to be getting better graphics when they're hitting the 360, I mean graphic enhancements

715
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,780
and whatnot.

716
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:53,300
So that's kind of something to look forward to, they're actually redoing the graphics

717
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:59,300
are enhancing them like they should have been, like with the Playstation 2, which was interesting.

718
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:05,800
A little bit better graphics on the Playstation 2 when you're playing the Playstation 1 games.

719
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:08,980
So that is how they're going to do it? They're going to release so many games a week for

720
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:13,280
backwards compatibility? Yeah, basically here's... I still have yet to really hear like a clear

721
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:19,540
definitive answer. It's going to be, well, what I heard was it's about 20, the numbers

722
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:26,100
they were throwing out about 15 to 25 of the top titles right now are going to be starting

723
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:31,220
the first week. Each week there's going to be more titles added to the list of compatibility.

724
00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:36,580
You have to have a system with a hard drive and you have to have an Xbox Live account

725
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:41,460
I think. Interesting. I'm not sure if it's a Live Gold account because that would be

726
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:47,880
really cheap of them but I wouldn't put it past them.

727
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:55,520
last story I have tonight, Gamasutra ran a story earlier this week that talks about several

728
00:44:55,520 --> 00:45:00,840
executives of the company that is producing and distributing the Gizmondo.

729
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:07,280
Supposedly they are connected to organized crime, the mob, Swedish, so the mob made your

730
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:08,280
Gizmondo.

731
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:12,160
Yes, they're connected to the Swedish mob supposedly and all this stuff.

732
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:17,200
Of course, you know, they use the word alleged and all that stuff, but wouldn't that be interesting

733
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:19,600
that the Gizmondo was actually funded by the mob.

734
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:22,960
It doesn't save it from being kind of crappy, which is what all the reviews are saying,

735
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:26,640
is that the game is crappy, crappy, crappy, or not the game, the system, and all its games

736
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:27,760
are crappy, crappy.

737
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:32,520
I have yet to put my hands on it, so I won't, you know, I'll withhold final judgment, but

738
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:37,200
rumor is this is going to go down in history somewhere next to the end gauge.

739
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:38,200
Sad.

740
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:39,200
Finally, this is...

741
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:40,920
Hey, you already had your final shot!

742
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:41,920
Alright, fine.

743
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:42,920
One more.

744
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:43,920
What do you want?

745
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:46,240
This is kind of old news because, you know, when people are downloading this, this won't

746
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:53,120
apply to them anymore, but this weekend was the Nintendogs kind of event going on at GameStop

747
00:45:53,120 --> 00:46:01,480
where you can actually download some new star glasses for your dog, and a special greeting

748
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:04,560
by Haley Duff.

749
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:07,360
Oh God!

750
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:10,200
So yeah, and it's...

751
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:11,960
I'm glad my dogs are dead.

752
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:18,680
Well, this is part of the event dubbed the Nintendo's Tricks and Treats Weekend, and

753
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:23,980
Nintendo and GameStop are donating $50,000 to the American Society for the Prevention

754
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:25,240
of Cruelty to Animals.

755
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:29,800
Well, if all I get out of it is a crappy message from Hayley Duff, then I'm glad I let my dog

756
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:33,720
starve for the past three weeks, because I haven't played that game at all.

757
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:38,000
I haven't fed my dog at all, so I'm done with that game.

758
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,440
Good thing it's not real.

759
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:42,000
Anyway, final thoughts, we're about done with the show.

760
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,600
Final thoughts, Loki?

761
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:48,000
I need to play Shadow Colossus this week, for sure.

762
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:48,840
Me too.

763
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:53,060
Otherwise, gonna be playing more, more, more warriors.

764
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:57,040
My final thought is, I need to not feed my dogs,

765
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:00,600
I need to feed myself right now, because I'm very hungry.
