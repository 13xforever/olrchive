5
00:03:53,220 --> 00:04:03,127
[SPEAKER_22]: On tonight's program, we're going to be talking a little bit about Extreme 2's online mode, because I got a chance to play that this week, and we're also going to be talking a little bit about Tycho Drummaster, because...

6
00:04:03,767 --> 00:04:10,150
[SPEAKER_22]: Xtifer picked that up this week and he's like obsessed with Taiko Drum Master all of a sudden so we definitely have to talk to him about that and his movie review.

7
00:04:10,611 --> 00:04:15,453
[SPEAKER_22]: All that and all the other crap you're used to here on this lovely program known as Orange Lounge Radio.

8
00:04:15,493 --> 00:04:16,093
[SPEAKER_22]: See you after this.

11
00:05:05,634 --> 00:05:09,117
[SPEAKER_09]: This mommy talk radio is so much more.

12
00:05:09,257 --> 00:05:10,098
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, God.

13
00:05:10,198 --> 00:05:11,039

00:05:34,699 --> 00:05:41,143
[SPEAKER_18]: Orange Lounge may contain plenty of... Just kidding.

18
00:05:41,243 --> 00:05:44,966
[SPEAKER_22]: Orange Lounge Radio will not contain any of that in this episode.

19
00:05:45,266 --> 00:05:46,907
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, isn't that special?

20
00:05:51,457 --> 00:06:09,904
[SPEAKER_19]: Orange Lounge Radio Live is a fully interactive program via our website at www.orangeloungeradio.com And now, here are your hosts for Orange Lounge Radio Live, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.

21
00:06:11,836 --> 00:06:20,764
[SPEAKER_22]: We are live, and this is episode number 159 for this October the 9th of 2005.

22
00:06:20,984 --> 00:06:26,449
[SPEAKER_22]: You're tuned in to Orange Lounge Radio, radio that gamers really want, and this...

23
00:06:26,909 --> 00:06:27,149
[SPEAKER_22]: DarkSakura

24
00:06:51,874 --> 00:06:53,595
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, I'm actually not sure where she's at.

25
00:06:53,635 --> 00:06:59,036
[SPEAKER_22]: I know she said something about homework was probably going to delay her a little bit, but we'll see what's going on.

26
00:06:59,096 --> 00:07:03,097
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm sure she's going to run through the door any minute now going, ah, traffic, or the line at Safeway or something.

27
00:07:03,117 --> 00:07:03,898
[SPEAKER_22]: So she'll be here any minute.

28
00:07:04,538 --> 00:07:06,418
[SPEAKER_22]: But we're here with us.

29
00:07:06,858 --> 00:07:09,959
[SPEAKER_22]: And by the way, when DarkSakura does get here, everybody, fired!

30
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:11,600
[SPEAKER_22]: Just kidding.

31
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:12,960
[SPEAKER_22]: I could never fire her.

32
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:13,660
[SPEAKER_22]: She'd kick my ass.

33
00:07:14,621 --> 00:07:16,521
[SPEAKER_22]: Right here is the one and only Loki.

34
00:07:16,541 --> 00:07:17,181
[SPEAKER_22]: Hello.

35
00:07:17,742 --> 00:07:18,302
[SPEAKER_22]: How you doing, Loki?

36
00:07:19,502 --> 00:07:24,264
[SPEAKER_22]: Good, except I'm good in the department of developing pictures.

37
00:07:25,004 --> 00:07:27,245
[SPEAKER_22]: We'll talk about this later, because I want to talk about how stupid that thing is.

38
00:07:27,306 --> 00:07:28,506
[SPEAKER_22]: So we'll talk about that in a little bit.

39
00:07:28,526 --> 00:07:31,007
[SPEAKER_22]: I noticed Loki is sporting his In the Courtroom shirt today.

40
00:07:31,107 --> 00:07:31,347
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

41
00:07:31,848 --> 00:07:36,410
[SPEAKER_22]: So those of you guys that won prizes a couple weeks ago, we finally got the In the Courtroom shirts.

42
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:38,130
[SPEAKER_22]: So our grand prize winner, who won that?

43
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:40,171
[SPEAKER_22]: Justin and Icy, I think, won the haiku thing.

44
00:07:40,311 --> 00:07:40,491
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

45
00:07:40,571 --> 00:07:43,633
[SPEAKER_22]: We're going to be sending the In the Courtroom shirt along with the In the Groove game this week.

46
00:07:44,193 --> 00:07:55,044
[SPEAKER_22]: And I'll tell you what, I can't say anything about something that's in the works right now, but I'll be damned if this isn't the best week for us to be doing this.

47
00:07:56,005 --> 00:07:57,507
[SPEAKER_22]: Save it for next week, because it's going to be great.

48
00:07:57,707 --> 00:07:58,548
[SPEAKER_13]: That's all I can say.

49
00:07:59,229 --> 00:07:59,569
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, I know.

50
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:04,754
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyway, we're here though, and we're going to be talking about all sorts of other stuff.

51
00:08:05,315 --> 00:08:07,377
[SPEAKER_22]: Bugged is also here tonight, one of our guests.

52
00:08:08,789 --> 00:08:09,049
[SPEAKER_12]: Howdy.

53
00:08:09,469 --> 00:08:09,950
[SPEAKER_22]: How you doing?

54
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:11,390
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, I have a PSP.

55
00:08:12,511 --> 00:08:13,452
[SPEAKER_12]: And fuck traffic, apparently.

56
00:08:13,652 --> 00:08:14,072
[SPEAKER_22]: I knew it.

57
00:08:14,432 --> 00:08:14,952
[SPEAKER_22]: What did I say?

58
00:08:14,992 --> 00:08:18,835
[SPEAKER_22]: I said she'd walk in here and she'd go, fuck traffic or fuck the line at Safeway.

59
00:08:19,235 --> 00:08:19,715
[SPEAKER_22]: One of the two.

60
00:08:21,496 --> 00:08:22,497
[SPEAKER_22]: Hi, DarkSakura, how are you?

61
00:08:23,857 --> 00:08:24,318
[SPEAKER_22]: That's your butt.

62
00:08:26,719 --> 00:08:27,079
[SPEAKER_08]: Next.

63
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:28,260
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright.

64
00:08:30,097 --> 00:08:33,441
[SPEAKER_22]: So we're here and we're about ready to get started with tonight's show.

65
00:08:33,782 --> 00:08:36,886
[SPEAKER_22]: Extifer is out in the front room playing Taiko Drum Master.

66
00:08:37,246 --> 00:08:37,707
[SPEAKER_22]: My fault.

67
00:08:37,827 --> 00:08:38,668
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, your fault.

68
00:08:38,728 --> 00:08:40,370
[SPEAKER_22]: I'll be talking to you about that later.

69
00:08:41,533 --> 00:08:42,174
[SPEAKER_22]: We'll get into that.

70
00:08:42,794 --> 00:08:44,375
[SPEAKER_22]: Meanwhile, though, let's get tonight's show started.

71
00:08:44,435 --> 00:08:45,256
[SPEAKER_22]: Get your butt in the chatroom.

72
00:08:45,276 --> 00:08:45,836
[SPEAKER_22]: WarrenTalentRadio.com.

73
00:08:45,856 --> 00:08:46,617
[SPEAKER_22]: We're going to come back.

74
00:08:46,637 --> 00:08:55,464
[SPEAKER_22]: We're going to talk a little bit about some things going on in the Bomani scene, although it's kind of a slow news week because everybody's playing Dance Dance Revolution Extreme 2.

75
00:08:56,124 --> 00:08:59,247
[SPEAKER_22]: I want to talk about online mode a little bit, though, because I finally got into online mode today.

76
00:08:59,287 --> 00:09:00,007
[SPEAKER_22]: It's very interesting.

77
00:09:00,328 --> 00:09:02,790
[SPEAKER_22]: And I can talk about my gaming router adventures and everything, so it'll be fun.

78
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:04,111
[SPEAKER_22]: We're going to have a fun show, kids.

79
00:09:04,151 --> 00:09:05,011
[SPEAKER_22]: We'll be back after this.

80
00:09:05,031 --> 00:09:06,753
[SPEAKER_22]: We're going to start it off this break with a song.

81
00:09:07,293 --> 00:09:14,820
[SPEAKER_22]: That definitely had a lot of people talking last week, and we're going to talk about it a little bit more this week, but we're going to play the original, uncensored version of Injection of Love.

82
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:15,641
[SPEAKER_22]: We'll be back after this.

83
00:09:50,327 --> 00:09:50,812
and many more.

84
00:11:06,823 --> 00:11:07,928
Thanks for watching!

85
00:11:38,695 --> 00:11:40,236
Thanks for watching!

86
00:13:27,188 --> 00:13:28,289
and the rest of the crew.

87
00:14:17,018 --> 00:14:20,824
Thanks for watching!

88
00:15:16,443 --> 00:15:17,264
Thanks for watching!

89
00:15:57,116 --> 00:15:58,617
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, did you hear about that show?

90
00:15:59,097 --> 00:15:59,678
[SPEAKER_01]: What show?

91
00:15:59,998 --> 00:16:05,461
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they play a lot of great Fermanian video game music, but if you listen to it, you have to listen to it again within seven days.

92
00:16:05,862 --> 00:16:07,143
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, I've heard of that station.

93
00:16:07,243 --> 00:16:07,583
[SPEAKER_22]: Really?

94
00:16:07,983 --> 00:16:10,104
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, I even listened to it a couple weeks ago.

95
00:16:10,585 --> 00:16:12,846
[SPEAKER_22]: Hey, what happens to you if you don't listen to it again?

96
00:16:13,046 --> 00:16:14,007
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, you die.

97
00:16:14,627 --> 00:16:15,188
[SPEAKER_22]: I, what?

98
00:16:15,988 --> 00:16:20,131
[SPEAKER_22]: Hey, wait, what's this crazy bitch doing coming out of my computer screen?

99
00:16:22,274 --> 00:16:24,801
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge Radio Listen or DIE!

100
00:16:28,496 --> 00:16:32,978
[SPEAKER_22]: Hi, we're back on Orange Lounge Radio, here, episode number 159.

101
00:16:33,598 --> 00:16:39,121
[SPEAKER_22]: God, every week I say one higher number, and I think, God damn, we've been doing this show a long time.

102
00:16:39,521 --> 00:16:41,262
[SPEAKER_22]: We're in, like, what, studio number three?

103
00:16:42,402 --> 00:16:50,065
[SPEAKER_22]: Actually, really it's four, if you think about it, because the show has been done, no, studio number five, because the show has been done at two of DarkSakura's places.

104
00:16:50,346 --> 00:16:52,186
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, because I moved once and I moved again.

105
00:16:52,306 --> 00:16:55,588
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, so, this show gets around quite a bit, so...

106
00:16:56,206 --> 00:16:56,906
[SPEAKER_06]: We're such a hoe.

107
00:17:12,369 --> 00:17:13,409
[SPEAKER_22]: DarkSakura, what the hell?

108
00:17:13,489 --> 00:17:14,069
[SPEAKER_22]: What did you do?

109
00:17:14,089 --> 00:17:35,155
[SPEAKER_06]: Friday night we had our supposed to be weekly Firefly Marathon, and we went out to do Late Night Lions and came back, and I was actually hunting down the Turbo Duo to play some Dracula X, and instead, Dan's like, put up your free Taiko

110
00:17:35,635 --> 00:17:42,417
[SPEAKER_06]: Drum Master, so I did, and I have an RO pad, I'm not going to say the name.

111
00:17:44,218 --> 00:17:46,878
[SPEAKER_06]: But I also have, of course, the original, because Dan got all that for free for me.

112
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:51,120
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we played a bunch, like two songs.

113
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,560
[SPEAKER_06]: My hands were bruised by the time I was done.

114
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:54,160
[SPEAKER_06]: Good deal.

115
00:17:54,841 --> 00:17:56,321
[SPEAKER_06]: And I won the watermelon contest.

116
00:17:57,421 --> 00:17:58,722
[SPEAKER_22]: The watermelon contest?

117
00:17:58,962 --> 00:17:59,762
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, and the mini game.

118
00:17:59,802 --> 00:18:01,262
[SPEAKER_22]: I haven't really played enough Taiko Dramas.

119
00:18:01,302 --> 00:18:02,503
[SPEAKER_22]: I've played Taiko No Tachigen.

120
00:18:03,206 --> 00:18:04,366
[SPEAKER_22]: But I don't remember that minigame.

121
00:18:04,386 --> 00:18:06,727
[SPEAKER_06]: So are you going to be importing some of the Taiko no Tatsujin?

122
00:18:06,747 --> 00:18:06,887
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

123
00:18:07,367 --> 00:18:11,648
[SPEAKER_22]: I've played like three different Taiko no Tatsujin games thanks to Navi the Pop and Music Whore.

124
00:18:12,348 --> 00:18:13,388
[SPEAKER_22]: He has like all of them.

125
00:18:13,568 --> 00:18:14,528
[SPEAKER_22]: So I've played a bunch of those.

126
00:18:14,548 --> 00:18:15,889
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't remember the watermelon eating game.

127
00:18:16,569 --> 00:18:18,029
[SPEAKER_22]: The intro is cracked out.

128
00:18:19,189 --> 00:18:21,730
[SPEAKER_22]: That is one of the queerest movies I've ever seen.

129
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:22,670
[SPEAKER_22]: The how to play.

130
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:25,451
[SPEAKER_22]: The how to play was great.

131
00:18:25,511 --> 00:18:26,451
[SPEAKER_22]: The how to play was like...

132
00:18:27,335 --> 00:18:30,336
[SPEAKER_22]: When the red dot comes, hit the note.

133
00:18:30,736 --> 00:18:31,696
[SPEAKER_22]: Boom, boom, ba-doom.

134
00:18:32,096 --> 00:18:32,916
[SPEAKER_22]: Boom, boom, ba-doom.

135
00:18:33,136 --> 00:18:34,356
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like this little song.

136
00:18:34,396 --> 00:18:35,756
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm talking about the intro, though.

137
00:18:36,177 --> 00:18:37,777
[SPEAKER_06]: The intro is so cracked out.

138
00:18:38,297 --> 00:18:40,637
[SPEAKER_06]: And it made me really have a craving for takoyaki.

139
00:18:42,358 --> 00:18:43,318
[SPEAKER_06]: Takoyaki's yummy.

140
00:18:43,438 --> 00:18:45,518
[SPEAKER_22]: Did it bring out your inner egg?

141
00:18:45,538 --> 00:18:48,119
[SPEAKER_22]: Where you're white on the outside, yellow on the inside?

142
00:18:50,679 --> 00:18:51,799
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want takoyaki.

143
00:18:51,819 --> 00:18:53,199
[SPEAKER_06]: Because takoyaki's yummy.

144
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,120
[SPEAKER_16]: Don't they have takoyaki bell?

145
00:18:59,163 --> 00:19:04,407
[SPEAKER_16]: I still have fake psoriasis.

146
00:19:04,427 --> 00:19:04,787
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at my toe.

147
00:19:23,646 --> 00:19:24,546
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

148
00:19:40,251 --> 00:19:43,354
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, because I didn't start itching until I was here doing the show.

149
00:19:43,674 --> 00:19:44,875
[SPEAKER_22]: You're allergic to extifer.

150
00:19:44,895 --> 00:19:45,856
[SPEAKER_22]: That's basically what it is.

151
00:19:46,256 --> 00:19:48,838
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm allergic to gay... Okay.

152
00:19:48,858 --> 00:19:49,959
[SPEAKER_05]: You're allergic to gay people?

153
00:19:49,979 --> 00:19:51,260
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that what you're going to say?

154
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:51,720
[SPEAKER_05]: Gay people?

155
00:19:52,761 --> 00:19:53,922
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you homophobic, ma'am?

156
00:19:53,962 --> 00:19:56,745
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm allergic to your carpet.

157
00:19:57,265 --> 00:19:59,066
[SPEAKER_22]: Your gay carpet.

158
00:19:59,086 --> 00:20:00,608
[SPEAKER_22]: You and I have something in common, honey.

159
00:20:01,348 --> 00:20:02,729
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't like that either.

160
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:04,391
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't like carpet either.

161
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:05,912
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay.

162
00:20:05,972 --> 00:20:06,172
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyway.

163
00:20:06,392 --> 00:20:06,873
[SPEAKER_06]: No, um...

164
00:20:09,073 --> 00:20:11,374
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I can't be allergic to gay because I caught that already.

165
00:20:11,974 --> 00:20:12,374
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, yeah.

166
00:20:12,734 --> 00:20:14,715
[SPEAKER_06]: At Spiggle five years ago.

167
00:20:14,835 --> 00:20:16,175
[SPEAKER_22]: How did you catch gay at Spiggle?

168
00:20:16,676 --> 00:20:19,596
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, okay, this is an old story.

169
00:20:20,497 --> 00:20:21,217
[SPEAKER_16]: Do tell.

170
00:20:22,157 --> 00:20:23,718
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember my big Pepsi bong.

171
00:20:24,898 --> 00:20:29,381
[SPEAKER_06]: I got this big bone-shaped Pepsi drink with the long straw.

172
00:20:29,401 --> 00:20:30,442
[SPEAKER_22]: Right, it was this drink.

173
00:20:30,482 --> 00:20:32,243
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know if they still sell it at Spiegel.

174
00:20:32,303 --> 00:20:32,884
[SPEAKER_22]: I highly doubt it.

175
00:20:32,904 --> 00:20:34,085
[SPEAKER_22]: Spiegel, by the way, Sunnyvale Golf Line.

176
00:20:34,285 --> 00:20:38,468
[SPEAKER_06]: And you had just got done playing an intense game of DDR.

177
00:20:39,108 --> 00:20:40,949
[SPEAKER_06]: So I said, here, do you want something to drink?

178
00:20:41,009 --> 00:20:42,230
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have any diseases.

179
00:20:42,631 --> 00:20:46,914
[SPEAKER_06]: And you say, okay, and take this big old drink, and I take it back, and I take my drink, and you go, I have gay.

180
00:20:46,934 --> 00:20:49,736
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, oh my god, suddenly I want Irene.

181
00:20:49,756 --> 00:20:50,156
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean...

182
00:20:52,762 --> 00:20:53,222
[SPEAKER_22]: I remember that.

183
00:20:53,242 --> 00:20:53,983
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, I remember that now.

184
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:55,444
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that was an old story.

185
00:20:56,365 --> 00:20:56,665
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

186
00:20:57,406 --> 00:21:05,412
[SPEAKER_06]: But it turned out, well, my doctor, after two weeks of all these other treatments and I don't get better, we decide it's not viral.

187
00:21:05,873 --> 00:21:09,095
[SPEAKER_06]: So he puts me on amoxicillin, which I've never reacted to before.

188
00:21:09,115 --> 00:21:11,417
[SPEAKER_06]: I called my mom to make sure before I started taking it.

189
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:13,078
[SPEAKER_06]: Mom, do you have any reactions to amoxicillin?

190
00:21:13,539 --> 00:21:14,640
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's just penicillin.

191
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:18,503
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's in the same family, but some people don't have reactions to one that they do to the other.

192
00:21:18,923 --> 00:21:20,164
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm like, okay, so I take it.

193
00:21:20,264 --> 00:21:20,685
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm fine.

194
00:21:20,725 --> 00:21:21,886
[SPEAKER_06]: I finish it up last week.

195
00:21:22,506 --> 00:21:26,810
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, Sunday, during the middle of the show, I start itch, itch, itch, itch.

196
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:28,051
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think anything of it.

197
00:21:28,071 --> 00:21:30,493
[SPEAKER_06]: Monday, I'm a little itchy, you know, just a little bit itcher.

198
00:21:30,513 --> 00:21:36,658
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I go to spin, which, of course, the worst thing you can do when you are having a rash is to exercise, because you are not supposed to be warm.

199
00:21:36,898 --> 00:21:40,141
[SPEAKER_22]: Spin, by the way, is a class at the gym where you ride a bike a lot.

200
00:21:40,641 --> 00:21:40,981
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

201
00:21:41,302 --> 00:21:41,662
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

202
00:21:42,182 --> 00:21:43,683
[SPEAKER_06]: In different and exciting positions.

203
00:21:43,804 --> 00:21:46,025
[SPEAKER_22]: But the bike does not spin around, contrary to popular belief.

204
00:21:46,045 --> 00:21:50,229
[SPEAKER_20]: Before that, I thought it was just, you know, what little kids do where they, you know, get up and spin, kind of...

205
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:53,270
[SPEAKER_22]: That was the best thing on the playground.

206
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:59,813
[SPEAKER_22]: You could spin the little merry-go-round, put your friends on it, and then you'd get five people to spin that thing as fast as you can.

207
00:21:59,993 --> 00:22:00,954
[SPEAKER_06]: And launch them into orbit.

208
00:22:00,994 --> 00:22:02,474
[SPEAKER_22]: Launch them into orbit.

209
00:22:02,514 --> 00:22:03,895
[SPEAKER_22]: Everybody gets so dizzy they throw up.

210
00:22:04,075 --> 00:22:04,435
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what?

211
00:22:04,455 --> 00:22:05,216
[SPEAKER_22]: That's still fun.

212
00:22:06,596 --> 00:22:08,357
[SPEAKER_22]: We need to do Orange Lounge Radio live at the park.

213
00:22:09,498 --> 00:22:11,178
[SPEAKER_22]: We need to do one of our podcasts at the park.

214
00:22:11,198 --> 00:22:12,919
[SPEAKER_22]: That would be awesome.

215
00:22:12,939 --> 00:22:13,679
[SPEAKER_22]: On the merry-go-round.

216
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:19,142
[SPEAKER_06]: As I was saying, Tuesday I have red welts all over my body.

217
00:22:19,895 --> 00:22:21,177
[SPEAKER_06]: I am itching and miserable.

218
00:22:21,918 --> 00:22:22,519
[SPEAKER_06]: Wednesday.

219
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:25,563
[SPEAKER_06]: I call the doctor in the morning and go ahead and schedule my appointment.

220
00:22:26,404 --> 00:22:29,268
[SPEAKER_06]: And as the day develops, my throat starts closing up.

221
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:30,630
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm having trouble breathing.

222
00:22:31,552 --> 00:22:33,254
[SPEAKER_06]: I had stomach cramps so bad.

223
00:22:33,274 --> 00:22:35,838
[SPEAKER_22]: You definitely didn't catch gay because your throat wouldn't be closing up.

224
00:22:39,102 --> 00:22:57,348
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, as I was saying, I went to eat at the deli that I normally do behind my work and as I was walking back, my stomach cramps were so bad that I would have to stop because I could not walk because it hurt to put the pressure on my stomach from, you know, the motion of walking.

225
00:22:57,928 --> 00:22:58,888
[SPEAKER_06]: So I went to the doctor.

226
00:23:01,189 --> 00:23:02,089
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is Drug Chat with Dark Sakura.

227
00:23:25,056 --> 00:23:34,623
[SPEAKER_06]: and then one of my co-workers who has issues with eczema let me use her prescription for this ointment that made the itch go away.

228
00:23:35,604 --> 00:23:37,545
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, I once had an allergic reaction to amoxicillin.

229
00:23:37,565 --> 00:23:39,687
[SPEAKER_22]: It was the first time I was ever on penicillin of any type.

230
00:23:39,707 --> 00:23:42,429
[SPEAKER_22]: I was probably like 12 years old and I don't even remember why I was on amoxicillin.

231
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:43,870
[SPEAKER_22]: Why do they put people on amoxicillin?

232
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:45,912
[SPEAKER_22]: Because they have sinus infections or something?

233
00:23:45,932 --> 00:23:47,393
[SPEAKER_22]: It's an antibiotic.

234
00:23:47,433 --> 00:23:47,993
[SPEAKER_22]: I love that stuff.

235
00:23:48,013 --> 00:23:48,654
[SPEAKER_22]: It tastes so good.

236
00:23:48,874 --> 00:23:50,215
[SPEAKER_22]: That is gross.

237
00:23:50,235 --> 00:23:50,335
Ew.

238
00:23:50,655 --> 00:23:51,716
[SPEAKER_22]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

239
00:24:08,995 --> 00:24:09,795
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't even know how to say it.

240
00:24:09,815 --> 00:24:10,335
[SPEAKER_06]: You know how bad it was?

241
00:24:10,355 --> 00:24:14,736
[SPEAKER_06]: At the club, I went in and sat on these couches, and it's under a black light.

242
00:24:15,756 --> 00:24:23,838
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm so very pale that all the places where I was broken out look like big black spots.

243
00:24:24,118 --> 00:24:24,638
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh my God.

244
00:24:24,658 --> 00:24:26,898
[SPEAKER_06]: Because my skin normally glows when I go in the club.

245
00:24:27,018 --> 00:24:28,999
[SPEAKER_20]: To which they went, oh no, she's infected.

246
00:24:30,579 --> 00:24:33,420
[SPEAKER_06]: Someone mentioned that my neck looked like it had a continent on it.

247
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,680
[SPEAKER_16]: Did it say you had the SARS?

248
00:24:35,686 --> 00:24:37,007
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it was SARS.

249
00:24:37,928 --> 00:24:39,729
[SPEAKER_22]: So besides Diseaseful, how was your week?

250
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:41,971
[SPEAKER_06]: I played lots of games.

251
00:24:43,873 --> 00:24:44,173
[SPEAKER_22]: Like what?

252
00:24:44,713 --> 00:24:46,875
[SPEAKER_06]: I finally opened up my copy of Katamari.

253
00:24:47,435 --> 00:24:49,317
[SPEAKER_22]: Yay, so we can say the K word again.

254
00:24:49,377 --> 00:24:50,198
[SPEAKER_06]: We can say the K word again.

255
00:24:50,278 --> 00:24:50,938
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright, good to hear.

256
00:24:51,939 --> 00:25:00,366
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I played some World of Warcraft and thought about asking Dan to buy me DDR and then I thought no.

257
00:25:00,766 --> 00:25:02,988
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, I realized why I can't ever play World of Warcraft.

258
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:04,079
[SPEAKER_06]: Why?

259
00:25:04,299 --> 00:25:11,282
[SPEAKER_22]: Because everybody, like a lot of people I know play World of Warcraft and everybody's trying to get me to sign up and go to their server.

260
00:25:11,622 --> 00:25:14,783
[SPEAKER_22]: The problem is that everybody is on a different server.

261
00:25:15,184 --> 00:25:20,286
[SPEAKER_22]: So if I sign up for that game, I'm going to have to pick a server to go to and I'm going to piss people off.

262
00:25:20,446 --> 00:25:21,286
[SPEAKER_06]: No, not necessarily.

263
00:25:22,586 --> 00:25:31,930
[SPEAKER_06]: And extra for having this conversation the other day when I was showing in World of Warcraft, you can have as many characters as you want on as many servers as you want to and not get charged for it.

264
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:33,551
[SPEAKER_06]: But I don't like the whole...

265
00:25:33,931 --> 00:25:35,592
[SPEAKER_22]: I was in an hour of gameplay, I made level 6.

266
00:25:35,672 --> 00:25:37,654
[SPEAKER_22]: You can't do that on Final Fantasy XI, I'm sorry.

267
00:25:37,674 --> 00:25:38,755
[SPEAKER_22]: Not in an hour of gameplay.

268
00:25:55,908 --> 00:25:59,711
[SPEAKER_06]: Unless you have people freaking tanking for you or something, but by yourself.

269
00:25:59,731 --> 00:26:01,553
[SPEAKER_22]: There's ways, but not when you first play.

270
00:26:01,813 --> 00:26:05,636
[SPEAKER_06]: You can run around and not kill anything and at least go up two levels.

271
00:26:06,727 --> 00:26:07,407
[SPEAKER_22]: On World of Warcraft?

272
00:26:07,547 --> 00:26:08,328
[SPEAKER_06]: On World of Warcraft.

273
00:26:08,908 --> 00:26:11,269
[SPEAKER_06]: You find a lake, you get 50 experience points.

274
00:26:11,309 --> 00:26:13,310
[SPEAKER_06]: You find a town, you get 100 experience points.

275
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:15,871
[SPEAKER_06]: You meet X person, you get 100 experience points.

276
00:26:15,891 --> 00:26:16,811
[SPEAKER_06]: That's retarded.

277
00:26:17,231 --> 00:26:18,112
[SPEAKER_06]: You finish a quest, you get 50.

278
00:26:18,252 --> 00:26:21,933
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, it is not for the simple reason it is an RPG.

279
00:26:22,053 --> 00:26:29,716
[SPEAKER_06]: If you do tabletop RPG, if you do live action RPG, you get experience for doing things and participating in the game.

280
00:26:30,216 --> 00:26:33,418
[SPEAKER_06]: Not for just going around doing freaking hack and slash, which I think is ridiculous.

281
00:26:33,858 --> 00:26:35,058
[SPEAKER_22]: You discover you have arms.

282
00:26:35,419 --> 00:26:36,319
[SPEAKER_22]: Two experience.

283
00:26:37,645 --> 00:26:40,006
[SPEAKER_22]: You discovered the secret to love making.

284
00:26:41,146 --> 00:26:42,327
[SPEAKER_22]: You just hit puberty!

285
00:26:42,507 --> 00:26:43,287
[SPEAKER_22]: Ten experience!

286
00:26:43,587 --> 00:26:45,148
[SPEAKER_22]: You growed your first pubes.

287
00:26:45,288 --> 00:26:46,108
[SPEAKER_22]: Five experience.

288
00:26:46,668 --> 00:26:52,830
[SPEAKER_06]: But I like that in the fact that experience is defined by what you do.

289
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:54,731
[SPEAKER_06]: Not just what you kill.

290
00:26:55,774 --> 00:26:56,475
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, Jamie.

291
00:26:57,175 --> 00:26:57,656
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, hi.

292
00:26:57,756 --> 00:26:58,776
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, everybody.

293
00:26:58,796 --> 00:27:00,798
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you take a break from Tycho long enough to say hello?

294
00:27:00,818 --> 00:27:01,098
[SPEAKER_04]: I did.

295
00:27:01,278 --> 00:27:01,558
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

296
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:03,000
[SPEAKER_04]: Yo, everyone.

297
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,721
[SPEAKER_04]: Are your hands bruised yet?

298
00:27:05,562 --> 00:27:06,702
[SPEAKER_04]: No, my hands aren't bruised yet.

299
00:27:07,383 --> 00:27:12,287
[SPEAKER_04]: What I was going to tell you to say is what happens when you die on World of Warcraft.

300
00:27:12,447 --> 00:27:14,088
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah, you have to go back and find your body.

301
00:27:14,729 --> 00:27:15,309
[SPEAKER_22]: You're a ghost.

302
00:27:15,629 --> 00:27:16,770
[SPEAKER_22]: I do remember seeing that, yeah.

303
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:19,132
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty cool, because I haven't died yet, because I'm awesome.

304
00:27:21,964 --> 00:27:22,344
[SPEAKER_22]: DarkSakura.com

305
00:27:42,775 --> 00:27:46,841
[SPEAKER_22]: Got Pizza x4, I think that's a reference to the slash pizza command in EverQuest.

306
00:27:47,322 --> 00:27:49,606
[SPEAKER_22]: You randomly die, 6 experience.

307
00:27:50,247 --> 00:27:51,508
[SPEAKER_22]: You learn what IRC is.

308
00:27:52,609 --> 00:27:53,350
[SPEAKER_22]: Ah, you guys are weird.

309
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:54,130
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright, um, anything else?

310
00:27:54,531 --> 00:28:03,819
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, if you think about it, though, you know, in real life, you know, the different things you do add to your experience and teach you along the way, and you level over here.

311
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:06,581
[SPEAKER_22]: Sometimes you de-level when you find things out in real life.

312
00:28:07,082 --> 00:28:07,982
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, ah!

313
00:28:08,022 --> 00:28:09,243
[SPEAKER_06]: This has traumatized me!

314
00:28:09,304 --> 00:28:10,505
[SPEAKER_06]: Minus 50 experience!

315
00:28:10,545 --> 00:28:12,726
[SPEAKER_22]: Your boyfriend's been fucking around on your back!

316
00:28:12,907 --> 00:28:19,072
[SPEAKER_22]: I did like the fact how they have a quest where you get a chicken, like, pet to follow you around, and the chicken pet's easily killed.

317
00:28:19,557 --> 00:28:23,119
[SPEAKER_22]: So it's like a very complex quest for a really useless item.

318
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:31,704
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, the last quest series of quests that I've been doing, and I'm on the last leg of this series, are the go to this fountain and fill this bottle and bring it back.

319
00:28:32,665 --> 00:28:43,031
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've done this with like five different locations, and now I'm going to the big town to give my bottle to somebody, and I'm like kind of underleveled for where I am because I've just been running quests.

320
00:28:43,413 --> 00:28:53,624
[SPEAKER_22]: I think it would be cooler in World of Warcraft if the chicken that followed you, you could start slashing it like over and over and then all of a sudden all the chickens start attacking you.

321
00:28:53,905 --> 00:28:58,750
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it says you got a cock in your ear, 50 experience points, and you got your brains fucked out.

322
00:29:00,592 --> 00:29:01,393
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Extover.

323
00:29:01,613 --> 00:29:03,896
[SPEAKER_06]: I like playing the zombies though because you can eat people.

324
00:29:05,552 --> 00:29:09,115
[SPEAKER_06]: If you play the undead, you can regain energy by feeding on corpses.

325
00:29:09,295 --> 00:29:10,316
[SPEAKER_06]: That's lovely.

326
00:29:10,416 --> 00:29:12,678
[SPEAKER_22]: So what happens if somebody eats your corpse before you find it?

327
00:29:13,059 --> 00:29:14,480
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's eating other corpses.

328
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:15,521
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't tried doing it yet.

329
00:29:16,142 --> 00:29:18,504
[SPEAKER_06]: The other good thing about it is that you regenerate XP.

330
00:29:19,885 --> 00:29:23,848
[SPEAKER_06]: And you regenerate your MP or energy if you're one of the undead.

331
00:29:23,868 --> 00:29:27,111
[SPEAKER_06]: You got sued by Konami.

332
00:29:27,352 --> 00:29:27,892
[SPEAKER_22]: That's great.

333
00:29:27,912 --> 00:29:29,173
[SPEAKER_22]: You got sued by Konami.

334
00:29:29,233 --> 00:29:29,774
[SPEAKER_22]: Minus 999 experience.

335
00:29:32,052 --> 00:29:37,696
[SPEAKER_06]: Wouldn't it be minus 573 experience points?

336
00:29:37,877 --> 00:29:46,764
[SPEAKER_22]: As I was saying, without saying anything, all I have to say is that this week, something, the most hilarious thing is about to happen.

337
00:29:47,164 --> 00:29:48,566
[SPEAKER_22]: I can't even put it into words.

338
00:29:50,267 --> 00:29:52,729
[SPEAKER_22]: Next week, you guys, is it going to be done by next Sunday?

339
00:29:52,849 --> 00:29:53,550
[SPEAKER_22]: Or do we have to wait two weeks?

340
00:29:53,570 --> 00:29:54,110
[SPEAKER_22]: It's Thursday.

341
00:29:54,691 --> 00:29:55,832
[SPEAKER_22]: So is it going to be done by next Sunday?

342
00:29:57,418 --> 00:29:58,358
[SPEAKER_22]: Stay tuned to our website.

343
00:29:58,378 --> 00:29:59,779
[SPEAKER_22]: We've got big news coming up.

344
00:29:59,899 --> 00:30:02,380
[SPEAKER_22]: And next Sunday, we're going to have a field day.

345
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,200
[SPEAKER_22]: That's all I have to say.

346
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:10,063
[SPEAKER_06]: I just find that the other thing that was occurring to me that I also find hilarious about that is just the number of things I'm going to have on display.

347
00:30:10,143 --> 00:30:10,683
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, I know.

348
00:30:10,723 --> 00:30:11,544
[SPEAKER_06]: When said person.

349
00:30:11,604 --> 00:30:11,844
[SPEAKER_22]: I know.

350
00:30:12,024 --> 00:30:12,624
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyway, anyway.

351
00:30:13,184 --> 00:30:14,305
[SPEAKER_06]: No more about that.

352
00:30:14,405 --> 00:30:14,725
[SPEAKER_06]: No more.

353
00:30:14,745 --> 00:30:15,746
[SPEAKER_22]: There's your teaser.

354
00:30:15,766 --> 00:30:16,126
[SPEAKER_06]: I dread.

355
00:30:17,066 --> 00:30:18,647
[SPEAKER_22]: I dread what's going to come of this.

356
00:30:18,747 --> 00:30:19,627
[SPEAKER_22]: I'll be bringing it out.

357
00:30:19,647 --> 00:30:20,107
[SPEAKER_06]: I dread.

358
00:30:20,447 --> 00:30:20,668
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

359
00:30:20,728 --> 00:30:22,008
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyway, our listeners are so lost.

360
00:30:22,068 --> 00:30:22,288
[SPEAKER_22]: I know.

361
00:30:22,328 --> 00:30:23,849
[SPEAKER_22]: What the fuck are they talking about?

362
00:30:25,603 --> 00:30:28,765
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to be putting out my popping music controller.

363
00:30:30,786 --> 00:30:34,788
[SPEAKER_22]: If the listeners are going to accuse us of jumping the shark ever, next week will be it.

364
00:30:35,088 --> 00:30:35,309
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh yeah.

365
00:30:35,329 --> 00:30:36,629
[SPEAKER_22]: I swear to God, next week will be it.

366
00:30:36,669 --> 00:30:39,211
[SPEAKER_06]: I even find this hilarious, they asked for it.

367
00:30:40,071 --> 00:30:42,633
[SPEAKER_22]: You should put other like, Bomani and stuff.

368
00:30:42,913 --> 00:30:43,773
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyway, moving on.

369
00:30:44,393 --> 00:30:45,034
[SPEAKER_22]: We'll be around.

370
00:30:45,274 --> 00:30:46,395
[SPEAKER_22]: Loki, how was your week, how was your day?

371
00:30:46,755 --> 00:30:47,835
[SPEAKER_22]: My week was okay.

372
00:30:49,426 --> 00:30:50,727
[SPEAKER_22]: I didn't play that many games.

373
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:53,949
[SPEAKER_22]: I played Burnout and more Burnout and more Burnout.

374
00:30:56,010 --> 00:31:02,374
[SPEAKER_22]: So anyways, my week started off with I had to go to Jury Duty.

375
00:31:03,315 --> 00:31:05,216
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh my god, you went to Jury Duty this week.

376
00:31:05,236 --> 00:31:05,657
[SPEAKER_22]: That's right.

377
00:31:05,837 --> 00:31:06,077
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

378
00:31:06,117 --> 00:31:06,637
[SPEAKER_22]: How'd that go?

379
00:31:06,977 --> 00:31:07,738
[SPEAKER_22]: I didn't get called.

380
00:31:07,778 --> 00:31:12,621
[SPEAKER_22]: Instead, I had to watch four movies because they played movies while we were waiting.

381
00:31:12,721 --> 00:31:13,842
[SPEAKER_22]: So I got to watch...

382
00:31:14,242 --> 00:31:25,844
[SPEAKER_22]: Advent Children again on my PSP, then I watched episode 4 of Star Wars, and then finally The Pacifier, followed by While You Were Sleeping.

383
00:31:27,113 --> 00:31:27,553
[SPEAKER_22]: XBOX 360 Games

384
00:31:47,927 --> 00:31:51,008
[SPEAKER_03]: You're supposed to let me take the doggies.

385
00:31:51,328 --> 00:31:51,648
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, well.

386
00:31:53,448 --> 00:31:55,209
[SPEAKER_22]: So then, wow, what a nice guy.

387
00:31:55,969 --> 00:31:58,930
[SPEAKER_22]: So I pre-ordered Gun and Project Gotham Racing 3.

388
00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:00,550
[SPEAKER_22]: That's going to be awesome.

389
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:03,511
[SPEAKER_22]: And what else did I do this week?

390
00:32:03,531 --> 00:32:04,491
[SPEAKER_22]: Eh, not too much.

391
00:32:04,511 --> 00:32:13,693
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm supposed to be getting stylish attire for the... Because I'm going to Lake Tahoe this week to actually...

392
00:32:14,392 --> 00:32:32,158
[SPEAKER_22]: for our 25th anniversary party for our company, and I have to wear stylist attire, so I have pinstripe pants, and I have to buy a shirt for it, I'm gonna look pimp, but anyways, what else, oh, that's pretty much it, you know, just lots of work stuff, and yeah.

393
00:32:33,530 --> 00:32:34,111
[SPEAKER_22]: Fun stuff like that.

394
00:32:59,654 --> 00:33:00,034
[SPEAKER_22]: They don't.

395
00:33:00,454 --> 00:33:00,895
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, they do.

396
00:33:01,295 --> 00:33:03,336
[SPEAKER_22]: They turned the supersize into large.

397
00:33:03,596 --> 00:33:05,897
[SPEAKER_22]: No, large is not as big as supersize.

398
00:33:05,917 --> 00:33:09,278
[SPEAKER_22]: Trust me, I am missing out on potential drink and fries.

399
00:33:09,858 --> 00:33:16,521
[SPEAKER_22]: And, you know, they finally switched the cups back to these nice plastic ones that don't fucking blow up when I put them in my cup holder.

400
00:33:16,841 --> 00:33:18,222
[SPEAKER_22]: Because that was really fun.

401
00:33:19,222 --> 00:33:21,483
[SPEAKER_22]: But at least, you know, they have that fixed now.

402
00:33:21,903 --> 00:33:28,386
[SPEAKER_22]: And what I have to say is now this new Monopoly game you play online as well as collect the stupid pieces.

403
00:33:28,406 --> 00:33:29,106
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, that's what I heard.

404
00:33:29,349 --> 00:33:40,016
[SPEAKER_22]: So I've been playing it online and so far I've won three times the stupid prints at this fish something or other, I don't know, some stupid online photo place.

405
00:33:40,437 --> 00:33:42,458
[SPEAKER_22]: So now I can get like 75 exposures.

406
00:33:42,678 --> 00:33:44,980
[SPEAKER_22]: That's great, except I don't take pictures of anything.

407
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:51,224
[SPEAKER_22]: You should take like pornographic pictures of something, or I don't know, like really raunchy photos.

408
00:33:51,384 --> 00:33:54,666
[SPEAKER_22]: Like take pictures of you and Ellie having sex or something and see if they'll develop it.

409
00:33:54,886 --> 00:33:55,907
[SPEAKER_22]: It won't develop that crap.

410
00:33:56,127 --> 00:33:56,668
[SPEAKER_22]: You don't know that.

411
00:33:57,068 --> 00:33:57,328
[SPEAKER_00]: Try it.

412
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:57,788
[SPEAKER_22]: You know that.

413
00:34:00,433 --> 00:34:01,234
[SPEAKER_22]: It'll make a statement.

414
00:34:02,675 --> 00:34:03,315
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, whatever.

415
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:03,735
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyways.

416
00:34:05,136 --> 00:34:06,477
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm just trying to win something else.

417
00:34:07,357 --> 00:34:08,959
[SPEAKER_22]: But I do like these Best Buy bucks.

418
00:34:09,259 --> 00:34:12,221
[SPEAKER_22]: That's the only thing I really play it for, is these Best Buy bucks.

419
00:34:12,761 --> 00:34:15,282
[SPEAKER_22]: Because I got $4 from two different fries.

420
00:34:15,463 --> 00:34:18,184
[SPEAKER_22]: But why didn't you just the $4 that you would have spent on food?

421
00:34:19,145 --> 00:34:19,905
[SPEAKER_22]: I didn't spend it on food.

422
00:34:20,025 --> 00:34:24,128
[SPEAKER_22]: I wanted fries, but I also got fries and free money.

423
00:34:24,808 --> 00:34:25,909
[SPEAKER_22]: Hey, I like free money.

424
00:34:25,929 --> 00:34:26,550
[SPEAKER_22]: Whatever.

425
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:27,070
[SPEAKER_22]: Whatever.

426
00:34:28,804 --> 00:34:32,405
[SPEAKER_22]: My week and my day was pretty okay.

427
00:34:32,465 --> 00:34:34,846
[SPEAKER_22]: Yesterday I went to Fry's, which is, you know, nerd heaven.

428
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:37,707
[SPEAKER_22]: Fry's is this giant electronic store here on the West Coast.

429
00:34:37,747 --> 00:34:41,388
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't think they have it on the East, or it's slowly going out there or something.

430
00:34:41,668 --> 00:34:43,269
[SPEAKER_22]: It's also Outpost.com online.

431
00:34:43,689 --> 00:34:48,050
[SPEAKER_22]: And so I went to Fry's and I finally bought myself a gaming router, a wireless gaming router.

432
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:52,672
[SPEAKER_22]: And what that will allow me to do is that, since Bug was good enough to give me a wireless...

433
00:34:53,832 --> 00:34:54,592
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you for watching!

434
00:35:12,717 --> 00:35:26,686
[SPEAKER_22]: But anyway, without having to run a cord to the living room, because the Xbox and PlayStation are out in the living room, we have the routers in here for the computers, so I don't have a cable long enough, so I had to get a wireless gaming router, basically.

435
00:35:26,726 --> 00:35:29,908
[SPEAKER_22]: It's specifically something you use to plug your Xbox and PlayStation into.

436
00:35:30,328 --> 00:35:34,811
[SPEAKER_22]: So I bought one of those, and it's nice to be back on Xbox Live and getting killed at Halo.

437
00:35:35,745 --> 00:35:36,145
[SPEAKER_22]: What's that?

438
00:35:36,165 --> 00:35:36,386
[SPEAKER_22]: What's that?

439
00:35:57,425 --> 00:35:59,167
[SPEAKER_22]: I need to play some poppin' music stuff next break.

440
00:36:00,728 --> 00:36:04,271
[SPEAKER_22]: I have poppin' music 13 stuff I never got to in a previous week, I don't think, but anyway.

441
00:36:04,291 --> 00:36:06,433
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you for reminding me.

442
00:36:07,013 --> 00:36:07,934
[SPEAKER_22]: What else did I do this week?

443
00:36:08,494 --> 00:36:09,175
[SPEAKER_22]: Not a whole lot.

444
00:36:09,195 --> 00:36:16,521
[SPEAKER_22]: I guess I started playing Extreme 2 online today, because since I got the router last night, I was playing Extreme 2 online a little bit today.

445
00:36:18,042 --> 00:36:18,843
[SPEAKER_22]: It's interesting.

446
00:36:18,863 --> 00:36:19,564
[SPEAKER_22]: It

447
00:36:21,772 --> 00:36:22,413
[SPEAKER_22]: Thanks for watching!

448
00:36:40,012 --> 00:36:52,297
[SPEAKER_22]: online thing where you can actually choose your opponent and choose your song, which is kind of interesting, but I wonder if that has to do with the fact that Xbox Live is just probably better set up for that kind of thing than the free PlayStation things.

449
00:36:52,417 --> 00:36:53,158
[SPEAKER_22]: I have no idea.

450
00:36:53,618 --> 00:37:01,921
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't program these games, so I don't know, but the online one, if you guys have played it, you know that you don't choose your opponent, you just search for an opponent, and you don't get to choose your song.

451
00:37:01,961 --> 00:37:05,763
[SPEAKER_22]: You only get to choose light, standard, heavy, or any.

452
00:37:06,723 --> 00:37:07,784
[SPEAKER_22]: So, it's interesting.

453
00:37:08,975 --> 00:37:35,270
[SPEAKER_22]: and I've played some top ranked players in the time that I've been on there and what's very interesting about doing that is that well, A, they've all really, really beat me but the other interesting thing is that it's randomly picking your song I've played probably like 15 to 18 matches online total which really isn't a lot, that's probably about less than an hour of game time I've played like 15 to 18 matches online Paranoia Survivor Max Heavy has come up three or four times at least

454
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:38,272
[SPEAKER_22]: And there's supposed to be like 70 freaking songs in this game.

455
00:37:38,332 --> 00:37:39,452
[SPEAKER_22]: It's picking songs at random.

456
00:37:39,793 --> 00:37:46,698
[SPEAKER_22]: I got Paranoia Survivor Max three or four times out of, like, one out of every three matches was Paranoia Survivor Max.

457
00:37:46,718 --> 00:37:47,338
[SPEAKER_22]: That's crap.

458
00:37:48,379 --> 00:37:48,939
[SPEAKER_22]: That's such crap.

459
00:37:49,139 --> 00:37:51,481
[SPEAKER_22]: Because Paranoia Survivor Max has bullshit steps.

460
00:37:51,821 --> 00:37:55,744
[SPEAKER_22]: If I want to play a song with bullshit steps, I'll go play in the groove, okay?

461
00:37:58,174 --> 00:37:59,315
[SPEAKER_22]: So that's my experience with online.

462
00:37:59,455 --> 00:38:00,235
[SPEAKER_22]: Otherwise, it's okay.

463
00:38:00,375 --> 00:38:01,396
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, I did the ranking thing.

464
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:02,676
[SPEAKER_22]: It's fun, I guess.

465
00:38:03,117 --> 00:38:22,287
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, playing matches is okay, except you can't really talk to the person you're playing, so you can only imagine what their reaction is like, because I know I was playing one kid, and he was doing really well, and then all of a sudden, like, I think he got pissed off that he got a good or something, because all of a sudden you just see boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, and all these, you know, misses going up his side of the screen, so it's just kind of funny.

466
00:38:22,487 --> 00:38:24,808
[SPEAKER_22]: But you can't really hear him like you can on Xbox, so...

467
00:38:25,928 --> 00:38:26,548
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, darn.

468
00:38:26,849 --> 00:38:27,129
[SPEAKER_22]: I know.

469
00:38:27,409 --> 00:38:29,890
[SPEAKER_22]: Then again, kids say really stupid shit on Xbox.

470
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:31,130
[SPEAKER_22]: Not so much DDR.

471
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:46,015
[SPEAKER_22]: The DDR rooms are rather decent compared to, like, Halo 2 or Doom 3, playing those online, and you got all those kids like, I'm gonna beat you up, I'm gonna cut you, I'm gonna shoot you, I do what I want!

472
00:38:46,455 --> 00:38:47,076
[SPEAKER_22]: Exactly.

473
00:38:47,536 --> 00:38:49,376
[SPEAKER_03]: My mom ain't home right now, I got a pony.

474
00:38:56,545 --> 00:38:56,845
[SPEAKER_22]: All right.

475
00:38:57,405 --> 00:38:58,825
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyway, so that's that.

476
00:38:59,845 --> 00:39:00,465
[SPEAKER_22]: Bogd, how was your week?

477
00:39:00,485 --> 00:39:00,886
[SPEAKER_22]: How was your day?

478
00:39:02,746 --> 00:39:04,926
[SPEAKER_16]: I sold all my DS stuff yesterday and picked up a PSP.

479
00:39:06,947 --> 00:39:09,848
[SPEAKER_16]: And just because, what attracted you to PSP?

480
00:39:10,248 --> 00:39:10,928
[SPEAKER_16]: The sound worked.

481
00:39:12,328 --> 00:39:13,368
[SPEAKER_16]: My DS's sound was dead.

482
00:39:13,388 --> 00:39:15,869
[SPEAKER_16]: They didn't ask me when I sold it if it worked or not.

483
00:39:18,038 --> 00:39:21,861
[SPEAKER_06]: That's because anything that doesn't fully function gets sent back for refurbishment.

484
00:39:22,441 --> 00:39:22,581
[SPEAKER_16]: Ah.

485
00:39:23,222 --> 00:39:28,465
[SPEAKER_06]: Nope, he didn't say anything about it, just... It's because they test them later, and if they don't work, they send it back to be refurbed.

486
00:39:28,765 --> 00:39:29,026
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, good.

487
00:39:29,526 --> 00:39:36,291
[SPEAKER_16]: I still got my 55 bucks for that, and as it turned out, all my stuff was worth 150 bucks, and this is clear back to, like, Pokemon Silver.

488
00:39:36,831 --> 00:39:37,091
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.

489
00:39:37,712 --> 00:39:38,692
[SPEAKER_16]: All my Game Boy stuff.

490
00:39:39,273 --> 00:39:40,654
[SPEAKER_16]: And, uh, Nintendogs.

491
00:39:41,074 --> 00:39:41,214
[SPEAKER_16]: Exactly.

492
00:39:42,042 --> 00:39:45,843
[SPEAKER_16]: I didn't play it often enough, but PSP I can at least do stuff other than play games on.

493
00:39:46,023 --> 00:39:50,545
[SPEAKER_22]: I think I'm kind of done with Nintendogs, which is kind of sad, because I really, really love that game.

494
00:39:50,625 --> 00:39:52,866
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, and I remember saying it was like... It's over far too quick.

495
00:39:53,266 --> 00:40:00,989
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, it doesn't hold my interest long enough, and maybe I'm just trying to get more of a game out of it, and it's really not supposed to be that.

496
00:40:02,089 --> 00:40:02,409
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know.

497
00:40:02,469 --> 00:40:03,930
[SPEAKER_22]: I hated that I have to play it.

498
00:40:04,699 --> 00:40:07,621
[SPEAKER_22]: It's just like, I'm like, oh, goddammit, I gotta feed the dog again.

499
00:40:07,681 --> 00:40:12,164
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, that's not too surprising, because that's how Tamagotchis are, and that's how, you know, other virtual pets... I can't find my PS.

500
00:40:12,824 --> 00:40:13,344
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, shit.

501
00:40:13,504 --> 00:40:15,225
[SPEAKER_06]: I left it in my locked drawer at work.

502
00:40:15,626 --> 00:40:16,366
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I take it to work.

503
00:40:16,806 --> 00:40:17,487
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, maybe that's it.

504
00:40:18,067 --> 00:40:21,229
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe, but my puppies are gonna be pissing all over my tatami house.

505
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:24,571
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, they don't pee on the floor, like they do in, like, Sims 2 and stuff.

506
00:40:24,771 --> 00:40:25,031
[SPEAKER_06]: Mm-hmm.

507
00:40:25,392 --> 00:40:25,532
[SPEAKER_22]: No.

508
00:40:26,412 --> 00:40:26,632
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyway.

509
00:40:28,053 --> 00:40:28,553
[SPEAKER_22]: So, anything else?

510
00:40:29,974 --> 00:40:32,616
[SPEAKER_16]: Went down to the Bay Area and ran into random people that we know.

511
00:40:33,586 --> 00:40:38,209
[SPEAKER_16]: I went to Dave & Buster's for dinner, and as I was leaving, I was like, wow, that really looks like... Holy crap, it is!

512
00:40:38,909 --> 00:40:43,292
[SPEAKER_16]: And there's a large... They took out two of the driving games right next to the entrance.

513
00:40:43,972 --> 00:40:44,292
[SPEAKER_16]: What was it?

514
00:40:44,492 --> 00:40:46,534
[SPEAKER_16]: The Namco... Whatever the hell it was.

515
00:40:47,114 --> 00:40:47,914
[SPEAKER_16]: And the Tokyo Cop.

516
00:40:48,114 --> 00:40:48,775
[SPEAKER_06]: Maximum Tune?

517
00:40:49,475 --> 00:40:50,376
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, Maximum Tune.

518
00:40:50,396 --> 00:40:51,236
[SPEAKER_16]: I like Tokyo Cop.

519
00:40:51,576 --> 00:40:53,037
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not because we got Maximum Tune!

520
00:40:53,598 --> 00:40:54,678
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, they took out Maximum Tune.

521
00:40:54,718 --> 00:40:55,479
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not in there anymore.

522
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:56,139
[SPEAKER_16]: Bastards.

523
00:40:56,419 --> 00:40:59,661
[SPEAKER_16]: But those two are gone, and there's now a giant six-player trivia game.

524
00:41:00,299 --> 00:41:01,740
[SPEAKER_16]: 6-player trivia game?

525
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,720
[SPEAKER_16]: 6-player trivia game.

526
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:05,401
[SPEAKER_16]: You have three buttons, A, B, and C. You just press the button of the answer.

527
00:41:05,642 --> 00:41:06,642
[SPEAKER_22]: That sounds kind of interesting.

528
00:41:06,662 --> 00:41:07,182
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a ticket game.

529
00:41:07,242 --> 00:41:08,743
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, I figured, yeah.

530
00:41:08,943 --> 00:41:17,788
[SPEAKER_16]: So, as I walk up, our other intrepid listener had a pile of tickets running around her feet several times, as per usual.

531
00:41:18,228 --> 00:41:18,728
[SPEAKER_16]: That's great.

532
00:41:18,888 --> 00:41:21,449
[SPEAKER_16]: I think she came up, like, six tickets.

533
00:41:21,469 --> 00:41:22,710
[SPEAKER_16]: She bought an Xbox.

534
00:41:23,010 --> 00:41:23,710
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, she saved it for me.

535
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:24,731
[SPEAKER_16]: This is Shark's Girl, by the way.

536
00:41:24,771 --> 00:41:26,952
[SPEAKER_22]: She's been on the show before, so some of our listeners might know her.

537
00:41:26,972 --> 00:41:27,952
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know what she went by on here.

538
00:41:27,992 --> 00:41:28,513
[SPEAKER_16]: Shark's Girl.

539
00:41:28,773 --> 00:41:28,993
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

540
00:41:29,945 --> 00:41:31,306
[SPEAKER_16]: She now has $50,000 in one.

541
00:41:31,686 --> 00:41:35,307
[SPEAKER_16]: She came up six short, so I gave her three tickets to put her over $50,000.

542
00:41:36,528 --> 00:41:37,548
[SPEAKER_16]: What's she buying now?

543
00:41:37,728 --> 00:41:37,948
[SPEAKER_16]: PS3.

544
00:41:41,970 --> 00:41:42,350
[SPEAKER_22]: Wow.

545
00:41:42,790 --> 00:41:43,250
[SPEAKER_22]: That's crazy.

546
00:41:43,810 --> 00:41:49,873
[SPEAKER_16]: But that was really strange to just randomly... Run into people?

547
00:41:49,953 --> 00:41:50,933
[SPEAKER_16]: Randomly run into people.

548
00:41:51,633 --> 00:41:55,715
[SPEAKER_16]: And I was thinking about actually text messaging her and saying, Hey, are you up for Dave & Buster's tonight?

549
00:41:55,735 --> 00:41:55,815
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

550
00:41:57,113 --> 00:41:57,653
[SPEAKER_22]: She read your mind.

551
00:41:58,013 --> 00:41:58,534
[SPEAKER_16]: Apparently so.

552
00:41:58,614 --> 00:41:58,954
[SPEAKER_16]: Amazing.

553
00:41:59,994 --> 00:42:02,795
[SPEAKER_22]: I want to go check out the trivia game, although I am sad about Tokyo Cop.

554
00:42:03,375 --> 00:42:03,675
[SPEAKER_22]: Don't be.

555
00:42:04,396 --> 00:42:05,436
[SPEAKER_22]: I like Tokyo Cop.

556
00:42:06,056 --> 00:42:07,297
[SPEAKER_06]: Tokyo Cop was really awful.

557
00:42:08,597 --> 00:42:09,277
[SPEAKER_22]: You bastards.

558
00:42:09,477 --> 00:42:14,539
[SPEAKER_22]: If it's the same game I'm thinking of, it's like right there when you walk through the door.

559
00:42:14,659 --> 00:42:16,080
[SPEAKER_16]: I like Tokyo Cop.

560
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:17,220
[SPEAKER_22]: Nobody else did.

561
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:22,722
[SPEAKER_22]: You know what they need to get anywhere because they're releasing it over here is the Mario Kart arcade game.

562
00:42:23,342 --> 00:42:25,323
[SPEAKER_22]: Holy God do I want to play that so bad.

563
00:42:25,984 --> 00:42:27,184
[SPEAKER_16]: That's geared towards kids.

564
00:42:27,524 --> 00:42:27,785
No, it's not.

565
00:42:28,265 --> 00:42:29,125
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I don't care.

566
00:42:29,185 --> 00:42:30,125
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll kick the kids out.

567
00:42:31,145 --> 00:42:33,786
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, all they have to do is put something you can hold your beer in.

568
00:42:34,766 --> 00:42:35,447
[SPEAKER_16]: Exactly.

569
00:42:36,107 --> 00:42:38,608
[SPEAKER_22]: I'll tell you what, that F-Zero arcade game kicked ass.

570
00:42:38,628 --> 00:42:41,528
[SPEAKER_22]: The only problem with F-Zero arcade game is that there was like three tracks.

571
00:42:41,548 --> 00:42:42,309
[SPEAKER_22]: Four.

572
00:42:42,329 --> 00:42:43,369
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, like four tracks.

573
00:42:43,689 --> 00:42:45,069
[SPEAKER_22]: And F-Zero, fuck that.

574
00:42:45,409 --> 00:42:48,790
[SPEAKER_22]: That F-Zero arcade game could have been amazing if they put more tracks on it.

575
00:42:49,371 --> 00:42:50,471
[SPEAKER_22]: And like more to do.

576
00:42:50,491 --> 00:42:52,131
[SPEAKER_22]: I wasn't so damn excited.

577
00:42:52,151 --> 00:42:53,652
[SPEAKER_22]: But the F-Zero arcade game was awesome.

578
00:42:53,732 --> 00:42:54,172
[SPEAKER_22]: I liked it.

579
00:42:55,097 --> 00:43:01,281
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, the nice thing about going to Dave & Buster's for dinner and stuff, they had the $13.99, get a $10 card.

580
00:43:01,861 --> 00:43:05,803
[SPEAKER_16]: Now it's $14.99 all day, Monday through Thursday.

581
00:43:06,904 --> 00:43:12,027
[SPEAKER_22]: By the way, secret message from our chat room, Poland, Poland, Poland, yes.

582
00:43:14,062 --> 00:43:15,343
[SPEAKER_22]: There you go.

583
00:43:15,603 --> 00:43:16,223
[SPEAKER_22]: She's psychic.

584
00:43:16,243 --> 00:43:19,085
[SPEAKER_22]: Sharkskrill just hopped in chat and said Poland, Poland.

585
00:43:19,185 --> 00:43:20,246
[SPEAKER_16]: She's probably listening.

586
00:43:20,726 --> 00:43:22,207
[SPEAKER_22]: I think so.

587
00:43:22,607 --> 00:43:23,027
[SPEAKER_22]: She claims to.

588
00:43:23,147 --> 00:43:25,389
[SPEAKER_22]: Her boyfriend was in chat earlier, so I think they're both listening.

589
00:43:25,869 --> 00:43:26,409
[SPEAKER_16]: It looks that way.

590
00:43:26,669 --> 00:43:26,830
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

591
00:43:28,070 --> 00:43:28,431
[SPEAKER_16]: Poland.

592
00:43:28,811 --> 00:43:29,571
[SPEAKER_16]: Definitely Poland.

593
00:43:29,771 --> 00:43:31,552
[SPEAKER_22]: Is that like a trivia question thing or something?

594
00:43:31,572 --> 00:43:33,634
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, everyone else answered right because it was pretty obvious.

595
00:43:34,874 --> 00:43:36,415
[SPEAKER_16]: And, well, she didn't.

596
00:43:38,617 --> 00:43:39,197
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, anyway.

597
00:43:39,637 --> 00:43:40,858
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't even remember the whole question.

598
00:43:41,684 --> 00:43:42,544
[SPEAKER_16]: It was something about Poland.

599
00:43:42,985 --> 00:43:44,385
[SPEAKER_16]: No, it wasn't about Poland.

600
00:43:44,405 --> 00:43:46,367
[SPEAKER_16]: It was about somebody being from a certain country.

601
00:43:47,407 --> 00:43:50,929
[SPEAKER_16]: And one of the choices was Poland, but the right answer was something completely odd.

602
00:43:52,230 --> 00:43:53,711
[SPEAKER_22]: I want to try this game out sometime.

603
00:43:53,731 --> 00:43:55,431
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm going to have to go back to Dave & Buster's.

604
00:43:56,012 --> 00:43:57,533
[SPEAKER_22]: I wish they'd build one here.

605
00:43:57,713 --> 00:44:01,435
[SPEAKER_22]: I love the idea of a Chuck E. Cheese for adults where kids aren't allowed after a certain time.

606
00:44:01,775 --> 00:44:02,635
[SPEAKER_22]: That's like heaven to me.

607
00:44:03,196 --> 00:44:04,396
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think they should be allowed at all.

608
00:44:04,436 --> 00:44:06,598
[SPEAKER_22]: In heaven, I don't want children to be allowed after 11 o'clock.

609
00:44:09,329 --> 00:44:11,511
[SPEAKER_16]: If you could just beat them up and kick them out of the way.

610
00:44:11,891 --> 00:44:12,132
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

611
00:44:12,392 --> 00:44:15,535
[SPEAKER_16]: Kind of like how in Katamari, when you hold down the button and run, you can keep off the cousins out.

612
00:44:15,595 --> 00:44:15,995
[SPEAKER_16]: Exactly.

613
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:18,017
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, that would be perfect for kids at midnight.

614
00:44:19,278 --> 00:44:23,122
[SPEAKER_16]: Because drunken rages are just like... Extifer, how was your week?

615
00:44:23,142 --> 00:44:23,722
[SPEAKER_04]: How was your day?

616
00:44:25,484 --> 00:44:28,967
[SPEAKER_04]: It was pretty much your usual week for me.

617
00:44:29,087 --> 00:44:31,850
[SPEAKER_04]: I went to work, you know...

618
00:44:33,683 --> 00:44:39,312
[SPEAKER_04]: Played music at home, showered, shaved, masturbated

619
00:44:40,447 --> 00:44:41,268
[SPEAKER_04]: More than a few times.

620
00:44:42,088 --> 00:44:48,071
[SPEAKER_04]: And also, you know, on Fridays, Fridays have officially been dubbed Firefly Fridays.

621
00:44:48,752 --> 00:44:53,995
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, Jamie and I, or DarkSakura and I, have... I prefer my name.

622
00:44:54,295 --> 00:45:03,240
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, Jamie and I went ahead and we went ahead and watched up to the end of the second disc of Firefly, which was great, good times.

623
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:04,941
[SPEAKER_06]: The James Bond episode.

624
00:45:05,982 --> 00:45:07,683
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's pretty funny.

625
00:45:07,824 --> 00:45:08,624
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty funny stuff.

626
00:45:08,805 --> 00:45:09,666
[SPEAKER_04]: Still recommend the movie.

627
00:45:09,706 --> 00:45:10,847
[SPEAKER_06]: A hero called me.

628
00:45:12,208 --> 00:45:12,689
[SPEAKER_06]: That was great.

629
00:45:12,789 --> 00:45:14,411
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, sorry.

630
00:45:15,091 --> 00:45:18,956
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyhow, we went and saw, we saw that at our place.

631
00:45:18,976 --> 00:45:26,924
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we also went to Lyons where I got to explain why Pez candy is like the sheepskin condom of candy.

632
00:45:30,846 --> 00:45:31,886
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you want to know why?

633
00:45:32,066 --> 00:45:32,807
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

634
00:45:34,067 --> 00:45:35,327
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably not, but okay.

635
00:45:35,828 --> 00:45:40,249
[SPEAKER_04]: Because sheepskin condoms are like the classic that nobody really thinks about now.

636
00:45:41,409 --> 00:45:42,430
[SPEAKER_04]: And so are Pez candies.

637
00:45:45,731 --> 00:45:46,691
[SPEAKER_04]: Pez candies go in those now?

638
00:45:48,032 --> 00:45:48,993
[SPEAKER_04]: They just may.

639
00:45:49,394 --> 00:45:55,500
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, a sheepskin condom Pez candy dispenser, that might be something to talk about.

640
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:56,922
[SPEAKER_04]: Just move on, please.

641
00:45:57,482 --> 00:45:58,944
[SPEAKER_04]: So that would make the Pez condiments, right?

642
00:46:00,746 --> 00:46:01,327
[SPEAKER_04]: Hehehe.

643
00:46:03,749 --> 00:46:06,512
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyways, that was my week.

644
00:46:06,973 --> 00:46:09,776
[SPEAKER_04]: As for yesterday, it wasn't that great.

645
00:46:09,877 --> 00:46:13,821
[SPEAKER_04]: It was kind of one of those dramatic family days.

646
00:46:14,442 --> 00:46:17,466
[SPEAKER_04]: I did end up seeing a movie that I'll probably talk about later on.

647
00:46:19,508 --> 00:46:22,569
[SPEAKER_04]: But otherwise, that's really all.

648
00:46:22,890 --> 00:46:34,655
[SPEAKER_04]: Today I bought Taiko Drum Master because I've been like kind of, oh, that's another thing that Jamie and I did on Friday night was I got to play her Taiko Drum Master, which is so much funner with two people, but it's still fun as with one person.

649
00:46:35,235 --> 00:46:35,535
[SPEAKER_04]: Funner.

650
00:46:35,795 --> 00:46:36,135
[SPEAKER_04]: Funner.

651
00:46:36,475 --> 00:46:37,936
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, funner is the new word of the day.

652
00:46:38,376 --> 00:46:39,957
[SPEAKER_04]: So much more fun, whatever, fuck you.

653
00:46:41,778 --> 00:46:42,558
[SPEAKER_04]: Smart ass.

654
00:46:43,519 --> 00:46:46,600
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyways, that's how the week was.

655
00:46:49,079 --> 00:46:56,321
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, I seem to remember that when we moved in together, and you know, you're going to be the roommate and everything, you didn't really like video games an awful lot.

656
00:46:56,361 --> 00:46:57,481
[SPEAKER_22]: Like, you had a few GameCube games.

657
00:46:57,501 --> 00:46:59,082
[SPEAKER_22]: You liked Metroid, you liked Donkey Konga.

658
00:47:00,122 --> 00:47:02,643
[SPEAKER_22]: Now you're running out to GameStop, I gotta get Tycho Drummaster!

659
00:47:02,803 --> 00:47:05,224
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean, Tycho Drummaster's like Donkey Konga.

660
00:47:05,564 --> 00:47:07,504
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a hell of a lot better than Donkey Konga.

661
00:47:08,164 --> 00:47:10,025
[SPEAKER_04]: It's great, but, you know...

662
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:15,736
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not so much bad with the video game stuff.

663
00:47:16,216 --> 00:47:17,478
[SPEAKER_04]: I can get into stuff.

664
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:19,500
[SPEAKER_04]: I used to be into it when I was little.

665
00:47:21,002 --> 00:47:22,404
[SPEAKER_04]: I played the Mario Brothers.

666
00:47:23,566 --> 00:47:23,946
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

667
00:47:24,767 --> 00:47:26,269
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, no problem for that.

668
00:47:26,469 --> 00:47:26,830
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

669
00:47:28,062 --> 00:47:29,762
[SPEAKER_22]: We're going to go to a quick break, boys and girls.

670
00:47:29,782 --> 00:47:32,763
[SPEAKER_22]: When we come back, maybe we'll do some Bomani news if there's anything going on.

671
00:47:32,783 --> 00:47:33,603
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know.

672
00:47:33,903 --> 00:47:34,484
[SPEAKER_22]: I have to look.

673
00:47:34,544 --> 00:47:35,284
[SPEAKER_22]: It's been a long week.

674
00:47:35,784 --> 00:47:40,465
[SPEAKER_22]: And we'll also get into the CAVE match tonight at some point, the FU's of the week.

675
00:47:40,805 --> 00:47:41,745
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, I want to talk about this, too.

676
00:47:41,825 --> 00:47:46,527
[SPEAKER_22]: Listen to our podcast this week, boys and girls, because we're going to be giving away PSP games.

677
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:48,347
[SPEAKER_22]: We're giving away Death Jr.

678
00:47:49,287 --> 00:47:51,428
[SPEAKER_22]: and Coated Arms on this week's podcast.

679
00:47:51,628 --> 00:47:52,248

[SPEAKER_22]: So listen to this week's podcast to figure out how to win.

684
00:48:03,331 --> 00:48:11,673
[SPEAKER_22]: Since Loki was so kind to remind me we haven't done some of this music yet, we're going to hear a brand new Sota Fujimori song starting us off with Spring Comes Around.

685
00:48:12,093 --> 00:48:12,873
[SPEAKER_22]: We'll be back after this.

00:50:21,505 --> 00:50:21,756
Thank you.

691
00:51:35,889 --> 00:51:36,811
Thanks for watching!

692
00:52:23,268 --> 00:52:26,639
[SPEAKER_13]: Please tell me, is your role in my heartache?

693
00:52:26,679 --> 00:52:29,789
[SPEAKER_13]: Take me now, but I can't take it anymore

694
00:53:00,653 --> 00:53:01,459
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for watching!

695
00:55:37,135 --> 00:55:37,819
DarkSakura.com

696
00:56:25,237 --> 00:56:28,421
[SPEAKER_22]: After this song, we'll be having a Let Them Move Marathon.

697
00:56:28,701 --> 00:56:30,864
[SPEAKER_13]: No!

698
00:56:30,984 --> 00:56:31,645
[SPEAKER_22]: Just kidding.

699
00:56:32,085 --> 00:56:33,127
[SPEAKER_22]: Orange Lounge Radio.

700
00:56:33,207 --> 00:56:34,808
[SPEAKER_22]: Crap-free Bavani Radio.

701
00:56:36,110 --> 00:56:37,772
[SPEAKER_22]: We're back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

702
00:56:37,792 --> 00:56:39,354
[SPEAKER_22]: That was some music from Poppin' Music 13.

703
00:56:40,075 --> 00:56:42,598
[SPEAKER_22]: I think they're calling that Carnival is the subtitle of that.

704
00:56:43,290 --> 00:56:48,937
[SPEAKER_22]: I haven't followed pop music in a little while, sorry kids, but they don't really have an arcade machine exactly around the corner.

705
00:56:49,658 --> 00:56:57,988
[SPEAKER_22]: Soda Fujimori with Spring Comes Around, the little 8-bit sounding song, I kind of, or actually, it's not so much 8-bit sounding, but it sounds like an old Commodore 64 game, I kind of dig this track.

706
00:56:59,377 --> 00:57:10,280
[SPEAKER_22]: That was Saitone with Opportunity, and DJ Taka with Moon in there as well, featuring Erika Mochizuki, and then Desro was the last one there, and the track is called Sun.

707
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:15,341
[SPEAKER_22]: Some Japanese text after that I can't read, because it's all garbled on my computer anyway, so Sun something.

708
00:57:18,382 --> 00:57:20,423
[SPEAKER_22]: And a lot of folks in the chat room are saying, hey, it's Daikinkai!

709
00:57:20,503 --> 00:57:21,743
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, yeah, it's Desro.

710
00:57:21,763 --> 00:57:22,523
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I miss?

711
00:57:22,823 --> 00:57:23,003
[SPEAKER_22]: What?

712
00:57:23,344 --> 00:57:25,264
[SPEAKER_06]: I sort of miss the move.

713
00:57:26,584 --> 00:57:28,145
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't think I have that anywhere.

714
00:57:28,165 --> 00:57:28,265
[SPEAKER_22]: Ah!

715
00:57:29,093 --> 00:57:30,174
[SPEAKER_22]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

716
00:57:57,973 --> 00:58:02,954
[SPEAKER_22]: And some folks are kind of wondering, what's so great about the Xbox 360?

717
00:58:03,234 --> 00:58:06,215
[SPEAKER_22]: Should I be going out and picking up one of these Xbox 360s at launch?

718
00:58:06,715 --> 00:58:07,515
[SPEAKER_22]: Should I wait?

719
00:58:08,035 --> 00:58:09,555
[SPEAKER_22]: What games are actually going to be released?

720
00:58:09,615 --> 00:58:13,576
[SPEAKER_22]: And boy, it seems like that launch list of Xbox 360 titles is getting shorter and shorter, doesn't it?

721
00:58:13,836 --> 00:58:14,056
[SPEAKER_22]: Yep.

722
00:58:14,616 --> 00:58:15,976
[SPEAKER_22]: There's another one that moved.

723
00:58:16,016 --> 00:58:16,556
[SPEAKER_22]: What moved now?

724
00:58:17,617 --> 00:58:19,837
[SPEAKER_22]: Wasn't it Project Gotham Racing, wasn't it?

725
00:58:19,857 --> 00:58:21,597
[SPEAKER_22]: No, Project Gotham's still there.

726
00:58:21,617 --> 00:58:22,798
[SPEAKER_22]: That's a launch title.

727
00:58:22,898 --> 00:58:24,758
[SPEAKER_22]: Microsoft's already guaranteed that's going to launch.

728
00:58:25,418 --> 00:58:30,200
[SPEAKER_22]: That cameo and Perfect Dark Zero are guaranteed to launch.

729
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:33,661
[SPEAKER_22]: In fact, they actually pushed them up a week, so now they're coming out November 10th.

730
00:58:34,121 --> 00:58:42,384
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyways, what did move, though, was Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter, one of the really cool squad-based first-version shooters that was coming out.

731
00:58:42,704 --> 00:58:50,287
[SPEAKER_22]: That got pushed all the way back to February, and before that was Frame City Killer, put out by Namco, which also got pushed back to February.

732
00:58:51,099 --> 00:58:52,100
[SPEAKER_22]: for more tweaking.

733
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:56,885
[SPEAKER_22]: I think Ghost Recon, what they're trying to do is finish the 360 stuff so they can launch them all at once.

734
00:58:57,986 --> 00:59:03,210
[SPEAKER_22]: So that basically eliminated what I was going to try to bring in as one of the first games.

735
00:59:03,651 --> 00:59:12,419
[SPEAKER_22]: I have pre-booked Gun, which is Grand Theft Auto and the Wild West, and then Project Gotham 3, which looks amazing from what I've seen in the gameplay footage.

736
00:59:12,699 --> 00:59:16,263
[SPEAKER_22]: Plus it has a minigame in it, Geometry Wars 2, which looks pretty cool.

737
00:59:16,883 --> 00:59:18,804
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, what the hell is this about the minigame that's in it?

738
00:59:18,864 --> 00:59:22,725
[SPEAKER_22]: Isn't it like, uh, frickin', you said it was like by the people that did Rez?

739
00:59:22,965 --> 00:59:24,265
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, it's not by the people that did Rez.

740
00:59:24,325 --> 00:59:27,346
[SPEAKER_22]: I said it looks like a cross between Asteroids, Rez.

741
00:59:27,406 --> 00:59:28,547
[SPEAKER_22]: I got really excited for a minute.

742
00:59:28,567 --> 00:59:32,788
[SPEAKER_22]: I was like, oh my god, because Rez is one of those titles that was so sexy and it was completely overlooked.

743
00:59:32,808 --> 00:59:39,170
[SPEAKER_22]: No, it is, it looks pretty cool, and apparently Geometry Wars 1 was available as a hidden game in Project Gotham 2.

744
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:40,480
[SPEAKER_22]: XBOX Live Arcade

745
01:00:04,113 --> 01:00:05,493
[SPEAKER_22]: It's kind of a new puzzle game.

746
01:00:06,093 --> 01:00:10,374
[SPEAKER_22]: Then there's another one that they showed, which is like a Marble Madness type game called Marble Blast.

747
01:00:11,395 --> 01:00:14,815
[SPEAKER_22]: But then this game, though, is going to be coming with Project Gotham 3.

748
01:00:15,536 --> 01:00:17,456
[SPEAKER_22]: And I've seen gameplay footage of it.

749
01:00:17,476 --> 01:00:21,697
[SPEAKER_22]: I was trying to bring some up to show you guys in the studio, but it looks amazing.

750
01:00:22,137 --> 01:00:23,497
[SPEAKER_22]: And I don't know.

751
01:00:23,517 --> 01:00:25,578
[SPEAKER_22]: I think it would be a perfect PSP game.

752
01:00:26,892 --> 01:00:28,673
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm worried about all these titles pushing back.

753
01:00:28,894 --> 01:00:33,938
[SPEAKER_22]: It's kind of like Microsoft really, really wants this system out this Christmas.

754
01:00:34,839 --> 01:00:36,220
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, and at this point, they can't push back.

755
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:36,900
[SPEAKER_22]: They really can't.

756
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:39,302
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, they'll piss off America if they push the system back any further.

757
01:00:39,322 --> 01:00:40,423
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, they're not going to push the system.

758
01:00:40,623 --> 01:00:45,788
[SPEAKER_22]: These games at launch... But what's the point of buying the system if there's no games available at launch?

759
01:00:45,808 --> 01:00:46,989
[SPEAKER_22]: There's going to be like 20-some games.

760
01:00:47,289 --> 01:00:49,571
[SPEAKER_22]: I know, but nothing that I really want.

761
01:00:50,191 --> 01:00:50,772
[SPEAKER_22]: Thanks for watching!

762
01:01:02,987 --> 01:01:12,113
[SPEAKER_22]: I picked up that Tecmo collection, I'm going to talk about this again on the podcast, but that Tecmo collection, I picked it up for Xbox, and it has the arcade game version of Tecmo Bowl on it, so not what I remember.

763
01:01:12,933 --> 01:01:15,475
[SPEAKER_22]: The NES version was so much more fluid and fun.

764
01:01:16,295 --> 01:01:16,996
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyway, sorry.

765
01:01:17,116 --> 01:01:22,479
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyways, for the 360, if you like sports, definitely going to be a system for you.

766
01:01:23,301 --> 01:01:26,343
[SPEAKER_22]: If you want racing games, there's going to be a lot of stuff.

767
01:01:26,383 --> 01:01:29,884
[SPEAKER_22]: Project Gotham, Ridge Racer, Need for Speed, Most Wanted.

768
01:01:30,505 --> 01:01:31,625
[SPEAKER_22]: Those are going to be three big ones.

769
01:01:31,845 --> 01:01:32,446
[SPEAKER_22]: Carmageddon?

770
01:01:33,146 --> 01:01:33,766
[SPEAKER_22]: No, Carmageddon.

771
01:01:33,966 --> 01:01:34,607
[SPEAKER_22]: Full Auto!

772
01:01:34,927 --> 01:01:36,608
[SPEAKER_22]: Full Auto coming out next year.

773
01:01:36,668 --> 01:01:37,868
[SPEAKER_22]: That one is exciting.

774
01:01:38,188 --> 01:01:38,989
[SPEAKER_22]: Put out by Sega.

775
01:01:39,249 --> 01:01:41,630
[SPEAKER_22]: It's like a cross between Twisted Metal and Burnout.

776
01:01:41,930 --> 01:01:43,271
[SPEAKER_22]: And all you have to do is mention Burnout.

777
01:01:43,311 --> 01:01:43,811
[SPEAKER_22]: Basically...

778
01:01:44,326 --> 01:01:47,788
[SPEAKER_22]: Giant, you know, cars with guns on them, shooting each other, you can blow up buildings.

779
01:01:47,848 --> 01:01:49,910
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, like Spy Hunter on crack.

780
01:01:50,150 --> 01:01:50,630
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

781
01:01:50,650 --> 01:01:51,051
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, cool.

782
01:01:51,071 --> 01:01:52,451
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, it's going to be freaking awesome.

783
01:01:52,471 --> 01:01:53,872
[SPEAKER_22]: But anyways, they have that one.

784
01:01:54,673 --> 01:01:57,715
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, that was the Xbox, that was the problem I had with the Xbox.

785
01:01:57,735 --> 01:02:07,862
[SPEAKER_22]: Because I, and it's no secret that on this program, because this program's been on long enough, where, you know, when we were first starting this program, PlayStation 2 was kind of new still, and Xbox was just on its way out.

786
01:02:08,462 --> 01:02:18,326
[SPEAKER_22]: and I said there's no effing way I'm ever going to buy an Xbox because all the Xbox is is sports games, racers, I had an acronym for it.

787
01:02:18,446 --> 01:02:19,706
[SPEAKER_22]: It's Sarsi.

788
01:02:19,826 --> 01:02:20,887
[SPEAKER_22]: It's Sarsi games.

789
01:02:20,927 --> 01:02:21,207
[SPEAKER_22]: That's it.

790
01:02:21,247 --> 01:02:22,127
[SPEAKER_22]: It's Sars games.

791
01:02:22,207 --> 01:02:25,308
[SPEAKER_22]: It's sports, action, racing, shooters.

792
01:02:26,069 --> 01:02:28,429
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, that's pretty much everything that comes out nowadays, though.

793
01:02:29,870 --> 01:02:32,391
[SPEAKER_22]: I guess because that's what sells, but... Well, let's put it this way.

794
01:02:32,411 --> 01:02:33,411
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, RPGs.

795
01:02:33,811 --> 01:02:35,132
[SPEAKER_22]: You've got Cameo, which is...

796
01:02:36,059 --> 01:02:38,902
[SPEAKER_22]: I do like the rare first-person shooter game.

797
01:02:39,002 --> 01:02:40,463
[SPEAKER_22]: I love Halo, for one, that's for sure.

798
01:03:04,111 --> 01:03:19,879
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, then, what else, um, for, like, your non-mainstream stuff, they've got Tony Hawk's American Wasteland, Gun, which is gonna be coming out, King Kong, um, they'll be coming out right afterwards, and then there's a dead spell of nothing until about...

799
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:22,281
[SPEAKER_22]: January, I think.

800
01:03:22,401 --> 01:03:24,142
[SPEAKER_22]: And then that's when there's some more games coming out.

801
01:03:24,462 --> 01:03:26,824
[SPEAKER_22]: But of course, you know, more stuff will be announced as we get closer.

802
01:03:26,884 --> 01:03:30,907
[SPEAKER_22]: Is it going to be like the DS launch where they kind of blow their load when the system first comes out?

803
01:03:30,987 --> 01:03:34,349
[SPEAKER_22]: And then you go through this like, and PSP, oh my god, the PSP.

804
01:03:34,790 --> 01:03:38,252
[SPEAKER_22]: PSP totally blew its load when it first came out and then six months of nothing.

805
01:03:38,272 --> 01:03:38,812
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, look at it this way.

806
01:03:39,113 --> 01:03:42,955
[SPEAKER_22]: December is a dead month as far as games coming out anyways for all systems.

807
01:03:43,015 --> 01:03:48,219
[SPEAKER_22]: It's just, they push stuff out of, you know, December and there's like 12 games total.

808
01:03:48,679 --> 01:03:49,360
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, that's it.

809
01:03:49,801 --> 01:03:51,382
[SPEAKER_22]: And some of us wait until Christmas Eve Eve to do it.

810
01:03:51,402 --> 01:03:51,582
[SPEAKER_22]: That's me.

811
01:03:51,602 --> 01:03:53,822
[SPEAKER_22]: December 23rd, every year I do my Christmas shopping.

812
01:04:15,011 --> 01:04:15,391
[SPEAKER_22]: Bloodstains

813
01:04:39,526 --> 01:04:40,707
[SPEAKER_22]: No, but I'm hoping.

814
01:04:40,747 --> 01:04:41,887
[SPEAKER_22]: I wish, but no.

815
01:04:43,228 --> 01:04:44,848
[SPEAKER_22]: Just really amazing stuff.

816
01:04:45,069 --> 01:04:47,009
[SPEAKER_22]: Quake 4 is going to be awesome.

817
01:04:47,630 --> 01:04:49,891
[SPEAKER_22]: Gun is just, I don't even know what Gun's going to be.

818
01:04:49,911 --> 01:04:50,931
[SPEAKER_22]: Gun's going to be phenomenal.

819
01:04:51,371 --> 01:04:55,153
[SPEAKER_22]: And then, I don't know, I'm going to pick up one more game.

820
01:04:55,433 --> 01:04:56,053
[SPEAKER_22]: $60 for these games.

821
01:04:56,093 --> 01:04:57,654
[SPEAKER_22]: I was looking at EB Games.

822
01:04:57,674 --> 01:05:00,055
[SPEAKER_22]: They have a whole big display trying to get people to pre-order this stuff.

823
01:05:00,075 --> 01:05:00,555
[SPEAKER_22]: $60 a game.

824
01:05:03,021 --> 01:05:03,401
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.

825
01:05:03,742 --> 01:05:04,102
[SPEAKER_22]: Crazy.

826
01:05:04,743 --> 01:05:08,646
[SPEAKER_22]: It's lame, but everything I buy is on store credit.

827
01:05:09,326 --> 01:05:14,271
[SPEAKER_22]: Right, right.

828
01:05:14,311 --> 01:05:21,497
[SPEAKER_22]: So a lot of people, we have a lot of younger listeners that listen to this program who don't hold down full-time jobs, so they can't exactly run out and buy a system.

829
01:05:21,797 --> 01:05:24,059
[SPEAKER_22]: And please don't get us wrong either.

830
01:05:24,179 --> 01:05:28,163
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, yes, I have a full-time job, but it's hard for me to go out and buy these systems.

831
01:05:28,203 --> 01:05:30,224
[SPEAKER_22]: If gaming wasn't a huge hobby of mine...

832
01:05:31,245 --> 01:05:40,307
[SPEAKER_22]: That's probably the only reason I'm going to buy a 360 on launch is because I feel like I have to to stay on top of what's going on in the industry for the podcast and stuff.

833
01:05:40,327 --> 01:05:41,808
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, here's what I'm saying here.

834
01:05:42,508 --> 01:05:45,629
[SPEAKER_22]: Don't go out and buy the system if you're unsure if you want it or not.

835
01:05:46,129 --> 01:05:54,271
[SPEAKER_22]: The only reason I'm buying one, same reason I bought PSP close to launch, same reason I bought DS, is because I'm a gaming whore and I'll have to pick this stuff up.

836
01:05:54,898 --> 01:06:16,029
[SPEAKER_22]: for two reasons, one to stay on, to have an edge at work, you know, the game sales stuff I do, and just an edge on everything, and then also just because I have to get everything, even though, you know, I may not play it, like my GameCube, you know, but it just, there's a lot of stuff coming out, if you have a PSP, definitely pick one of those up, DS,

837
01:06:17,079 --> 01:06:18,639
[SPEAKER_22]: Tons of stuff for internet, you know?

838
01:06:18,779 --> 01:06:18,979
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

839
01:06:19,559 --> 01:06:21,100
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, I'm so excited about DS Internet.

840
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:22,980
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm going to have them all anyway.

841
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:26,801
[SPEAKER_22]: I was going to kind of ask you about this because you're kind of a systems whore.

842
01:06:26,921 --> 01:06:27,841
[SPEAKER_22]: You make no secret about that.

843
01:06:27,861 --> 01:06:31,422
[SPEAKER_22]: You own, like, is there any system that's ever been released that you do not own?

844
01:06:31,602 --> 01:06:32,582
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have a CD-i.

845
01:06:33,222 --> 01:06:35,682
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have a Fairchild Channel S, although Dan has owned one.

846
01:06:35,702 --> 01:06:36,342
[SPEAKER_22]: Do you have a 3DO?

847
01:06:36,983 --> 01:06:37,123
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

848
01:06:37,143 --> 01:06:37,823
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

849
01:06:37,943 --> 01:06:38,723
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't want a 3DO.

850
01:06:38,803 --> 01:06:39,223
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, I know.

851
01:06:39,423 --> 01:06:41,063
[SPEAKER_22]: Who wants a 3DO, really?

852
01:06:41,103 --> 01:06:43,304
[SPEAKER_22]: Is there any game on the 3DO that makes that system worthwhile?

853
01:06:43,324 --> 01:06:43,764
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, okay, okay.

854
01:06:43,784 --> 01:06:43,824
[SPEAKER_06]: A 1?

855
01:06:44,884 --> 01:06:45,424
[SPEAKER_06]: What do I have?

856
01:06:46,325 --> 01:06:48,365
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a Neo Geo, I have a Neo Geo CD.

857
01:06:48,645 --> 01:06:51,386
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, if we ask what you do have, it's going to take you all day.

858
01:06:51,426 --> 01:06:53,947
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but what I don't have also could take me all day.

859
01:06:54,087 --> 01:06:59,909
[SPEAKER_06]: The thing that's at the top of my list of what I want right now, realistically, is a Duo RX.

860
01:07:00,890 --> 01:07:02,230
[SPEAKER_06]: A PC Engine Duo RX.

861
01:07:02,310 --> 01:07:03,831
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, so we know you're going to get a 360 at launch.

862
01:07:03,871 --> 01:07:05,371
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm actually wanting the PS3 more.

863
01:07:07,532 --> 01:07:17,058
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, there's also the fact that your husband works at GameStop, so you also, in your household, kind of have a need to stay on top of what's going on in the gaming world, right?

864
01:07:17,098 --> 01:07:20,721
[SPEAKER_22]: With you doing the radio and him doing the selling of the items in the store.

865
01:07:20,801 --> 01:07:26,144
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we're gonna have all that, and on top of that, any game that comes out, he can basically check it out of the store.

866
01:07:26,344 --> 01:07:26,745
[SPEAKER_22]: Right, right.

867
01:07:26,765 --> 01:07:28,526
[SPEAKER_06]: He can play it all we want to and put it back.

868
01:07:28,826 --> 01:07:30,067
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, that's cool.

869
01:07:30,427 --> 01:07:31,007
[SPEAKER_06]: Not a big deal.

870
01:07:31,687 --> 01:07:33,568
[SPEAKER_22]: But you say you're more excited about PS3?

871
01:07:34,168 --> 01:07:34,408
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

872
01:07:34,488 --> 01:07:35,909
[SPEAKER_06]: Why?

873
01:07:36,349 --> 01:07:55,555
[SPEAKER_06]: Having studied a bit more on the cell processor myself, prior to seeing the demo at E3, and that knowing that there's going to be a new Tekken, oh my god, and other things that I'm more than positive will be out based on things that I've seen.

874
01:07:56,235 --> 01:08:02,424
[SPEAKER_22]: The Final Fantasy remake, which I know is still just a rumor but I'm convinced it's happening.

875
01:08:03,266 --> 01:08:04,187
[SPEAKER_22]: What was the other thing?

876
01:08:07,150 --> 01:08:09,151
[SPEAKER_22]: Damn it, racing game that's incredibly fun.

877
01:08:09,171 --> 01:08:10,852
[SPEAKER_22]: Gran Turismo, thank you, Gran Turismo.

878
01:08:10,872 --> 01:08:12,893
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not as excited about Gran Turismo, but Dan is.

879
01:08:14,873 --> 01:08:34,462
[SPEAKER_06]: Just knowing that... And on top of that, I really, really hope that people... See, the PlayStation 2, I think, would have been better had people been more skilled in programming games for it because they didn't... There wasn't a lot of... I wouldn't say very good use of the channels because...

880
01:08:34,742 --> 01:08:36,544
[SPEAKER_06]: Hence the jaggedy games, you know.

881
01:08:36,844 --> 01:08:40,186
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, oh, let's put in surround sound, but not, you know, make the game look nice.

882
01:08:41,427 --> 01:08:41,748
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello?

883
01:08:44,722 --> 01:09:09,615
[SPEAKER_06]: and me, I always go for the underdog system myself so that would normally put me on the boat with the revolution however, I think that the controller is retarded and the Xbox games, I'm really not too excited about anything coming out on the 360 I can't knock the Nintendo controller though until I get to touch it and play a game and see how it really feels racing games, yay sports games

884
01:09:10,433 --> 01:09:10,833
[SPEAKER_22]: Yay.

885
01:09:10,913 --> 01:09:14,956
[SPEAKER_22]: And that's, to bring it full circle, that's how I felt about the Xbox when it first came out.

886
01:09:14,996 --> 01:09:16,757
[SPEAKER_22]: And then sure enough, I got to play it.

887
01:09:16,777 --> 01:09:19,359
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, all that's going to end up in my house is Project Gotham.

888
01:09:19,399 --> 01:09:24,162
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm like, I'm tired of Dan playing Need for Speed Underground 2 all the damn time.

889
01:09:24,242 --> 01:09:26,584
[SPEAKER_22]: He'll bring in Need for Speed Most Wanted then, Underground 3.

890
01:09:27,605 --> 01:09:28,165
[SPEAKER_22]: Goodie, goodie.

891
01:09:28,285 --> 01:09:28,746
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay!

892
01:09:29,146 --> 01:09:30,427
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, gee!

893
01:09:30,647 --> 01:09:39,313
[SPEAKER_22]: Finally, I caved, and I bought an Xbox when Halo... I finally got to play Halo for the first time, and I was like, wow, this is a shooter I actually really enjoy.

894
01:09:39,873 --> 01:09:40,874
[SPEAKER_22]: And Halo 2, of course.

895
01:09:41,274 --> 01:09:46,698
[SPEAKER_22]: The DDR on Xbox, which I still believe the Ultramix 2 is the best DDR game they put out, period.

896
01:09:47,338 --> 01:09:47,438
[SPEAKER_22]: And...

897
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:51,883
[SPEAKER_22]: There's another, Fable, I actually kind of enjoy a little bit.

898
01:09:52,263 --> 01:09:54,425
[SPEAKER_22]: And all that is on Xbox.

899
01:09:55,006 --> 01:09:59,491
[SPEAKER_22]: And so Xbox finally kind of grew out of the SARS games for me.

900
01:09:59,871 --> 01:10:10,382
[SPEAKER_06]: On top of that, I'm probably going to be getting an import PS3 as well, because I know that there are going to be more games coming out overseas on the PS3 than there will be on the Xbox 360.

901
01:10:11,448 --> 01:10:12,148
[SPEAKER_22]: I want to bring this up.

902
01:10:12,649 --> 01:10:15,090
[SPEAKER_22]: I've been wanting to bring this topic up on the show for like two weeks.

903
01:10:15,110 --> 01:10:15,830
[SPEAKER_22]: Now it just hit me.

904
01:10:16,050 --> 01:10:18,111
[SPEAKER_22]: You saying this reminded me to bring this up.

905
01:10:20,372 --> 01:10:23,734
[SPEAKER_22]: Obviously, we've been to E3, so we've talked to a lot of people in the industry.

906
01:10:23,754 --> 01:10:25,274
[SPEAKER_22]: We continue to talk to some of those people.

907
01:10:25,894 --> 01:10:29,236
[SPEAKER_22]: I was having a very interesting conversation with somebody who works in the industry not that long ago.

908
01:10:30,817 --> 01:10:39,841
[SPEAKER_22]: This person was saying that there was a game that the company wanted to bring out that had a lot of hype going for it in Japan.

909
01:10:40,709 --> 01:10:41,050
[SPEAKER_22]: I think.

910
01:10:41,570 --> 01:10:46,534
[SPEAKER_22]: The game is something that some people in Japan are looking forward to, and they wanted to bring it out here.

911
01:10:48,156 --> 01:10:57,024
[SPEAKER_22]: But I guess Sony gets some type of approval over what games actually come out for the system, and Sony rejected the game, saying it's too Japanese.

912
01:10:58,083 --> 01:10:58,744
[SPEAKER_22]: That's stupid.

913
01:10:59,044 --> 01:11:00,626
[SPEAKER_22]: And I'm thinking, what?

914
01:11:01,186 --> 01:11:03,729
[SPEAKER_22]: You rejected a game because it's too Japanese?

915
01:11:04,149 --> 01:11:08,874
[SPEAKER_22]: And then my second thought is, how in the fuck did Katamari Damacy ever come out in this country?

916
01:11:08,914 --> 01:11:12,098
[SPEAKER_06]: Even better, why did it sell better here than there?

917
01:11:14,175 --> 01:11:14,675
[SPEAKER_06]: which is true.

918
01:11:16,456 --> 01:11:17,576
[SPEAKER_22]: That boggled my mind.

919
01:11:17,596 --> 01:11:19,917
[SPEAKER_06]: From what I understand, the game cut even in Japan.

920
01:11:20,017 --> 01:11:21,598
[SPEAKER_06]: Here, it just, like, oversold.

921
01:11:21,958 --> 01:11:23,458
[SPEAKER_22]: No one likes Japanese stuff.

922
01:11:23,498 --> 01:11:33,042
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, that's why, you know, you see all these networks like G4 TV, oh, I don't know, you know, Cartoon Network, all this stuff.

923
01:11:33,322 --> 01:11:40,724
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, they're, of course, not playing any anime of any sort whatsoever, so obviously no one likes the Japanese culture at all.

924
01:11:40,744 --> 01:11:42,565
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, that's why you don't see people out there

925
01:11:44,365 --> 01:11:58,249
[SPEAKER_22]: And I can see where maybe Sony wants some type of quality control over the games, but... And then I think, my god, why did Driver 3 come out?

926
01:11:58,389 --> 01:12:03,470
[SPEAKER_06]: All they need, all they need, well actually Sony right now is hiring for localization.

927
01:12:04,511 --> 01:12:05,491
[SPEAKER_06]: For localization people.

928
01:12:05,990 --> 01:12:17,599
[SPEAKER_06]: Which leads me to think that, you know, I was taking that as a positive sign for a little while, hoping that they were saying, hey, you know, these import games are, you know, doing really big in the States.

929
01:12:17,619 --> 01:12:20,661
[SPEAKER_06]: They've got a big, you know, how else did we get DDR here?

930
01:12:20,681 --> 01:12:25,024
[SPEAKER_22]: That's also a good question, and now Beatmania on its way out, too.

931
01:12:25,104 --> 01:12:27,846
[SPEAKER_22]: I understand how they could reject the game because it's too Japanese anyways.

932
01:12:28,187 --> 01:12:30,108
[SPEAKER_22]: So if the game's too Japanese, then it won't sell.

933
01:12:30,188 --> 01:12:31,709
[SPEAKER_22]: Then that company won't make any money.

934
01:12:31,809 --> 01:12:33,591
[SPEAKER_22]: At least it's not crap, so it's not...

935
01:12:33,971 --> 01:12:34,412
[SPEAKER_22]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

936
01:12:53,463 --> 01:12:54,304
[SPEAKER_06]: We have DDR now.

937
01:12:55,045 --> 01:12:56,266
[SPEAKER_06]: And we also have cheap knockoffs.

938
01:12:56,546 --> 01:13:14,644
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, an interesting follow-up to that is that the same person said that since that game's not going to come out here for the PlayStation now, that a different form, I obviously really don't want to give this away because of the nature of the story, but a different type of game in the series will be coming out on Xbox.

939
01:13:16,124 --> 01:13:16,764
[SPEAKER_22]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

940
01:13:37,041 --> 01:13:37,682
[SPEAKER_06]: The Chaff.

941
01:13:39,082 --> 01:13:41,884
[SPEAKER_22]: Have you seen some of those budget titles they have now for like PlayStation 1?

942
01:13:42,344 --> 01:13:44,645
[SPEAKER_22]: Maybe they let those come out because they don't care anymore.

943
01:13:44,665 --> 01:13:47,486
[SPEAKER_22]: Those are just like the ultimate in... Like the $5 and $10 Walmart games.

944
01:13:47,506 --> 01:13:48,387
[SPEAKER_22]: Incredible Crisis!

945
01:13:48,647 --> 01:13:55,070
[SPEAKER_22]: The Texas Hold'em 50,000... Puzzle Star!

946
01:13:55,110 --> 01:13:57,211
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, and then the PopCap games.

947
01:13:57,551 --> 01:14:04,054
[SPEAKER_22]: Things that you can play for free on the internet, on Flash, coming out for like Game Boy Advance and PlayStation.

948
01:14:04,594 --> 01:14:05,735
[SPEAKER_22]: Bejeweled, again!

949
01:14:05,755 --> 01:14:05,795
[SPEAKER_22]: No!

950
01:14:06,075 --> 01:14:06,596
[SPEAKER_06]: Catamari Sells

951
01:14:21,991 --> 01:14:22,792
[SPEAKER_06]: www.orangeloungeradio.com

952
01:14:43,752 --> 01:14:44,633
[SPEAKER_22]: We're opening that up.

953
01:14:45,113 --> 01:14:50,116
[SPEAKER_22]: Not a whole lot of people signed into Skype tonight, so I'm thinking maybe we're going to have a dry night of Skype calls.

954
01:14:50,896 --> 01:14:52,037
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know what's going on, though.

955
01:14:52,077 --> 01:14:58,721
[SPEAKER_06]: People would... People freaking call, or we set you on fire and do nothing but talk about Britney Spears' baby.

956
01:14:59,922 --> 01:15:02,523
[SPEAKER_22]: No, I don't want to... Didn't you do that last week?

957
01:15:02,583 --> 01:15:04,484
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, let's have Britney Spears C-section chat.

958
01:15:04,524 --> 01:15:05,645
[SPEAKER_22]: No, I don't... Oh, gross.

959
01:15:05,905 --> 01:15:06,345
[SPEAKER_22]: God.

960
01:15:06,986 --> 01:15:10,608
[SPEAKER_22]: I would rather go back to talking about the sheepskin con than what the hell I said about it earlier.

961
01:15:10,628 --> 01:15:12,129
[SPEAKER_06]: She's worried that her scar won't go away.

962
01:15:13,843 --> 01:15:14,583
[SPEAKER_22]: Poor thing.

963
01:15:16,024 --> 01:15:17,765
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, and of course she spoke the whole time.

964
01:15:17,805 --> 01:15:18,405
[SPEAKER_06]: She carried over that.

965
01:15:18,425 --> 01:15:18,785
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, look at that.

966
01:15:18,825 --> 01:15:19,445
[SPEAKER_22]: We got a call.

967
01:15:19,485 --> 01:15:19,905
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at that.

968
01:15:20,106 --> 01:15:24,007
[SPEAKER_22]: Just for you, DarkSakura, it's our regular caller on the line.

969
01:15:24,867 --> 01:15:25,388
[SPEAKER_22]: How are you?

970
01:15:25,408 --> 01:15:27,348
[SPEAKER_22]: Huh?

971
01:15:27,609 --> 01:15:27,969
[SPEAKER_22]: Hello?

972
01:15:29,109 --> 01:15:29,409
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

973
01:15:29,509 --> 01:15:30,370
[SPEAKER_05]: You on the radio?

974
01:15:32,150 --> 01:15:32,571
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's this?

975
01:15:34,351 --> 01:15:34,651
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

976
01:15:36,332 --> 01:15:37,472
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously you know who it is.

977
01:15:38,073 --> 01:15:39,953
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, it's the legend of Zaku, everybody.

978
01:15:40,134 --> 01:15:41,014
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you, my friend?

979
01:15:43,556 --> 01:15:54,711
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just waiting for my Yankees to finish up the Angels so we can take the game to their place tomorrow and win.

980
01:15:54,951 --> 01:15:56,073
[SPEAKER_05]: What's baseball?

981
01:15:56,133 --> 01:15:57,455
[SPEAKER_05]: What is the baseball?

982
01:15:58,596 --> 01:16:00,738
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the number one sport in Japan, ever.

983
01:16:00,758 --> 01:16:01,539
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm from the Bronx.

984
01:16:01,699 --> 01:16:03,280
[SPEAKER_05]: I love Yankees.

985
01:16:03,340 --> 01:16:09,366
[SPEAKER_05]: Yankees are, you know, Yankees basically are up there in breathing and lovemaking.

986
01:16:09,486 --> 01:16:19,215
[SPEAKER_22]: Saku, I know how it is, because in this town where we live, they don't have a, well, they do have a minor league baseball team, but they have a really big basketball team, and I swear to God, everywhere you go, it's king.

987
01:16:19,315 --> 01:16:21,217
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

988
01:16:41,859 --> 01:16:46,145
[SPEAKER_05]: Digital Life starts this Friday, so I'm heading there this Saturday.

989
01:16:46,625 --> 01:16:50,310
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if I'm going to compete in freestyle because I'm having second thoughts.

990
01:16:50,830 --> 01:16:54,555
[SPEAKER_05]: The fact that I don't have any money to prepare for a really good one is just making it worse.

991
01:17:01,623 --> 01:17:06,730
[SPEAKER_22]: I've judged a few, and trust me, Zaku, you couldn't be as bad as some of the ones I've seen in my life.

992
01:17:07,191 --> 01:17:08,272
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, I've done it before.

993
01:17:08,312 --> 01:17:10,716
[SPEAKER_05]: I've done a really good one, even though I DQ'd.

994
01:17:10,756 --> 01:17:17,485
[SPEAKER_05]: But this year, in the tournament this year, they're using an impartial jury.

995
01:17:18,152 --> 01:17:22,593
[SPEAKER_05]: In other words, they're using people that don't know shit about DER.

996
01:17:22,613 --> 01:17:25,374
[SPEAKER_06]: That means you're going to have a horribly scored tournament.

997
01:17:28,214 --> 01:17:35,896
[SPEAKER_05]: No, because last year, the judges were biased and basically handed people victories where they should have went to others.

998
01:17:36,296 --> 01:17:39,217
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why you have equal representation.

999
01:17:39,257 --> 01:17:41,338
[SPEAKER_06]: Trust me, it was biased.

1000
01:17:41,458 --> 01:17:41,998
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw it.

1001
01:17:43,158 --> 01:17:46,482
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me finish before you go jumping all over me.

1002
01:17:47,102 --> 01:17:49,404
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why you need equal representation.

1003
01:17:49,444 --> 01:17:54,329
[SPEAKER_06]: You need a certain number of people who know what good freestyle is.

1004
01:17:55,190 --> 01:17:58,554
[SPEAKER_06]: You need at least one freestyle winner in there.

1005
01:17:59,595 --> 01:18:05,440
[SPEAKER_06]: And you need to have two people on there who may not have competed in DDR, but people who...

1006
01:18:06,121 --> 01:18:08,943
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you would trust to be impartial.

1007
01:18:09,224 --> 01:18:12,186
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that you do need to have judges who have not actually played.

1008
01:18:12,266 --> 01:18:13,107
[SPEAKER_22]: I agree with the mix.

1009
01:18:13,207 --> 01:18:14,008
[SPEAKER_22]: I agree with the mix.

1010
01:18:14,028 --> 01:18:14,768
[SPEAKER_06]: We did have that.

1011
01:18:14,928 --> 01:18:16,730
[SPEAKER_05]: We did have that last year, and it failed.

1012
01:18:17,090 --> 01:18:19,552
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that ended up doing more harm than good.

1013
01:18:20,012 --> 01:18:21,554
[SPEAKER_05]: We had everything that we said, Jamie.

1014
01:18:21,814 --> 01:18:24,596
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I've done before, and I've had success.

1015
01:18:24,616 --> 01:18:25,997
[SPEAKER_06]: That has to do with people.

1016
01:18:27,058 --> 01:18:28,800
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, because we have to play it safe.

1017
01:18:28,840 --> 01:18:34,905
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't want any bullshit, and, you know, we don't want any bullshit from other people saying that they got screwed over, that they should have won, so...

1018
01:18:36,104 --> 01:18:38,726
[SPEAKER_05]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1019
01:19:06,584 --> 01:19:12,187
[SPEAKER_22]: I really wish we were able to get a sneak peek of Guitar Hero 2, but sometimes we just don't get our way.

1020
01:19:13,508 --> 01:19:14,408
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully.

1021
01:19:15,189 --> 01:19:26,495
[SPEAKER_05]: As I said, I still have time to register for freestyle, but at this point I wish I had the money to really invest on something memorable and something that will even give me...

1022
01:19:33,161 --> 01:19:34,502
[SPEAKER_22]: I wish I could have gone to Digital Life.

1023
01:19:34,602 --> 01:19:37,044
[SPEAKER_22]: I would have judged you a fair tournament, I swear.

1024
01:19:37,064 --> 01:19:37,565
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, man.

1025
01:19:37,625 --> 01:19:39,747
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm going to let you go because we have other people who want to get in.

1026
01:19:40,268 --> 01:19:41,248
[SPEAKER_22]: But have a good night, Zaku, okay?

1027
01:19:41,369 --> 01:19:42,149
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright, man.

1028
01:19:42,550 --> 01:19:43,170
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright, later.

1029
01:19:44,111 --> 01:19:46,192
[SPEAKER_22]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1030
01:20:13,197 --> 01:20:15,159
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyway, moving on, let's see what the next caller wants.

1031
01:20:16,840 --> 01:20:17,981
[SPEAKER_22]: Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1032
01:20:20,584 --> 01:20:22,145
[SPEAKER_22]: Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1033
01:20:25,268 --> 01:20:26,789
[SPEAKER_22]: Is your microphone on, caller?

1034
01:20:26,929 --> 01:20:27,230
[SPEAKER_22]: Hello.

1035
01:20:28,462 --> 01:20:30,082
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have a throat?

1036
01:20:30,142 --> 01:20:33,323
[SPEAKER_22]: It's a new caller calling in, so I think maybe it's not working right.

1037
01:20:33,783 --> 01:20:35,503
[SPEAKER_22]: What's that, Echo123 or whatever?

1038
01:20:35,523 --> 01:20:38,644
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, give Echo123 a call and try us back, alrighty?

1039
01:20:38,884 --> 01:20:39,264
[SPEAKER_22]: Have a good one.

1040
01:20:39,884 --> 01:20:45,105
[SPEAKER_22]: So, remember guys, before you call in the first time, it's always a good idea to call.

1041
01:20:45,325 --> 01:20:47,706
[SPEAKER_22]: There's a username on Skype, Echo123.

1042
01:20:48,006 --> 01:20:49,426
[SPEAKER_22]: Make sure you can hear yourself.

1043
01:20:49,526 --> 01:20:51,047
[SPEAKER_22]: But, you know, that kind of stuff's bound to happen.

1044
01:20:51,087 --> 01:20:53,247
[SPEAKER_22]: We appreciate the new people are at least trying to get through.

1045
01:20:53,967 --> 01:20:57,688
[SPEAKER_22]: Not that we don't like hearing from the regulars, but new blood once in a while is a good thing.

1046
01:20:58,248 --> 01:21:01,250
[SPEAKER_22]: Let's go to... Oh, damn, our lines are lighting up here.

1047
01:21:01,290 --> 01:21:01,930
[SPEAKER_22]: Let's go to another call.

1048
01:21:02,190 --> 01:21:03,191
[SPEAKER_22]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1049
01:21:04,512 --> 01:21:06,013
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Sky, it's Al Mullet calling.

1050
01:21:06,193 --> 01:21:06,933
[SPEAKER_00]: Al Mullet!

1051
01:21:06,973 --> 01:21:08,014
[SPEAKER_00]: How the hell have you been?

1052
01:21:09,035 --> 01:21:11,056
[SPEAKER_00]: I have been doing pretty damn good, Sky.

1053
01:21:11,096 --> 01:21:12,257
[SPEAKER_00]: How about yourself?

1054
01:21:12,397 --> 01:21:12,677
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.

1055
01:21:12,817 --> 01:21:15,859
[SPEAKER_22]: I have not heard from you in, like, three months.

1056
01:21:15,879 --> 01:21:16,399
[SPEAKER_22]: Where have you been?

1057
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:18,921
[SPEAKER_22]: I dropped off the face of the earth.

1058
01:21:19,001 --> 01:21:20,702
[SPEAKER_22]: Funny story, but we'll get to that in a minute.

1059
01:21:20,902 --> 01:21:22,043
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, well, what's on your mind?

1060
01:21:22,103 --> 01:21:23,804
[SPEAKER_22]: What do we owe this call to today?

1061
01:21:25,226 --> 01:21:30,149
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I missed the initial hullabaloo on Extreme 2 and just want to offer my input on it.

1062
01:21:30,309 --> 01:21:31,030
[SPEAKER_22]: Sure, yeah.

1063
01:21:31,130 --> 01:21:36,273
[SPEAKER_22]: A lot of people really appreciate your input because, of course, you write reviews and, of course, I'll let you get your plug.

1064
01:21:36,293 --> 01:21:37,254
[SPEAKER_22]: Are you still working for those guys?

1065
01:21:38,154 --> 01:21:39,155
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I am.

1066
01:21:39,315 --> 01:21:40,776
[SPEAKER_22]: I'll let you work in your plug there.

1067
01:21:41,056 --> 01:21:46,580
[SPEAKER_22]: But a lot of folks in the Bomani scene really trust your reviews on the game, so I'm very curious to hear your thoughts on Extreme 2.

1068
01:21:48,390 --> 01:21:50,572
[SPEAKER_00]: Extreme 2 really impressed me.

1069
01:21:50,772 --> 01:21:57,337
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe not as much as a song list, a song list was great anyway, but the presentation really impressed me.

1070
01:21:58,037 --> 01:22:08,084
[SPEAKER_00]: The fact that Dance Master Mode is now the official mode of the game, it's more like other games, you know, like...

1071
01:22:10,365 --> 01:22:21,349
[SPEAKER_22]: This is why I said about it last week, Amol, is that it feels less like an arcade port and more like a PlayStation game, as opposed to just trying to copy exactly what's going on in the arcade.

1072
01:22:21,709 --> 01:22:26,491
[SPEAKER_22]: Having the Dance Master be the central thing makes it feel more like something that is for the home.

1073
01:22:26,531 --> 01:22:36,135
[SPEAKER_22]: And since we're not getting a new arcade mix anytime soon, it's kind of interesting to see the franchise really now for the first time in America kind of growing out of that.

1074
01:22:36,575 --> 01:22:37,115
[SPEAKER_22]: So it's kind of neat.

1075
01:22:38,188 --> 01:22:38,889
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.

1076
01:22:39,129 --> 01:22:40,830
[SPEAKER_00]: And also the background movies.

1077
01:22:40,870 --> 01:22:47,756
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot get enough of all of these new movies, especially since there's so many exclusive movies for a particular song.

1078
01:22:48,336 --> 01:22:51,619
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Daikin Kai jumped like a million points for me.

1079
01:22:51,919 --> 01:22:52,139
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

1080
01:22:52,620 --> 01:22:53,701
[SPEAKER_00]: I play that for the movie.

1081
01:22:54,941 --> 01:22:55,862
[SPEAKER_22]: It's got some great videos.

1082
01:22:55,902 --> 01:23:02,506
[SPEAKER_22]: I still have yet to see some of the ones, like the one for Sakurai here is really good, and some of the other ones, because I haven't played enough Dance Master Mode.

1083
01:23:02,706 --> 01:23:05,568
[SPEAKER_22]: Believe it or not, I'm actually playing Dance Master Mode on a pad.

1084
01:23:06,068 --> 01:23:11,771
[SPEAKER_22]: So I'm getting slow for some of them.

1085
01:23:13,932 --> 01:23:16,394
[SPEAKER_00]: It took me a week to unlock all the songs.

1086
01:23:16,474 --> 01:23:22,477
[SPEAKER_00]: I ended up with like 73, then I took a break for a few days, and then I came back to it and unlocked Survivor Max.

1087
01:23:24,198 --> 01:23:25,520
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you had a chance to play the online mode?

1088
01:23:26,520 --> 01:23:28,262
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, no, not yet.

1089
01:23:28,442 --> 01:23:35,787
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've tried to find time for it, but things keep popping up, and I'd rather be unlocking courses and whatnot because I'm an unlock whore.

1090
01:23:37,229 --> 01:23:37,749
[SPEAKER_22]: Right, right.

1091
01:23:39,550 --> 01:23:43,413
[SPEAKER_22]: Although, is it true or not, I haven't really heard any follow-up on this.

1092
01:23:43,673 --> 01:23:50,599
[SPEAKER_22]: Some rumors are going around that the game will give you pity unlocks if you go for a long time without unlocking anything, that it finally just starts giving them to you.

1093
01:23:51,414 --> 01:23:56,198
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I can confirm that you will get pity stuff showing up in the shop for no particular reason.

1094
01:23:56,379 --> 01:23:56,679
[SPEAKER_22]: Great.

1095
01:23:57,019 --> 01:24:12,373
[SPEAKER_00]: I only say this because I go back and I do the extra arrow missions and the alternate conditions, and as I'm doing that, unlocking the hidden missions, I'm getting a bunch of songs up here in the shop.

1096
01:24:13,354 --> 01:24:27,488
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's really interesting because I ended up unlocking all the characters at one point and once I unlocked my last character a bunch of songs showed up for no reason.

1097
01:24:28,283 --> 01:24:31,506
[SPEAKER_22]: I noticed a bunch of songs randomly showed up in my shop, too.

1098
01:24:31,606 --> 01:24:38,371
[SPEAKER_22]: So, you know, for those folks that are getting angsty with Dance Master Mode, just keep trying, and the game will pity you eventually, and you'll start getting some cool songs.

1099
01:24:39,212 --> 01:24:39,693
[SPEAKER_22]: Exactly.

1100
01:24:40,193 --> 01:24:43,676
[SPEAKER_22]: One other thing I want to... Well, first of all, go ahead and give your site a plug, because it's been a little while.

1101
01:24:45,241 --> 01:24:50,385
[SPEAKER_00]: www.insidepulse.com We are reviewing games, kicking ass, and taking names.

1102
01:24:50,425 --> 01:24:51,066
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, that rhymed.

1103
01:24:51,286 --> 01:24:51,646
[SPEAKER_22]: Sounds good.

1104
01:24:51,706 --> 01:24:59,992
[SPEAKER_22]: And you also do, like, it's not just games, but there's wrestling, and there's movies and TVs and all that stuff.

1105
01:25:00,473 --> 01:25:04,656
[SPEAKER_00]: Movies, TVs, music, comic books, and action figures.

1106
01:25:05,016 --> 01:25:06,097
[SPEAKER_22]: The whole nine yards.

1107
01:25:06,197 --> 01:25:07,078
[SPEAKER_22]: Everything nerdy.

1108
01:25:07,858 --> 01:25:11,241
[SPEAKER_22]: They just call that beanerd.com because it's everything nerdy.

1109
01:25:14,102 --> 01:25:21,566
[SPEAKER_22]: I have to add, Series 2 of the Invader Zim figurines are out now, and that made me extremely excited.

1110
01:25:21,706 --> 01:25:23,126
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you for that completely random footnote.

1111
01:25:23,446 --> 01:25:26,148
[SPEAKER_06]: Are they, you know, inaction figures?

1112
01:25:26,408 --> 01:25:26,608
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

1113
01:25:26,788 --> 01:25:27,248
[SPEAKER_06]: See what I mean?

1114
01:25:27,408 --> 01:25:27,728
[SPEAKER_06]: Nerds!

1115
01:25:27,929 --> 01:25:28,269
[SPEAKER_22]: All of you!

1116
01:25:28,469 --> 01:25:28,769
[SPEAKER_06]: Nerds!

1117
01:25:29,749 --> 01:25:29,929
What?

1118
01:25:30,510 --> 01:25:34,952
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, you want to talk about nerds, it's a conversation that Extrovert and I had at Lions about glamour.

1119
01:25:36,309 --> 01:25:38,031
[SPEAKER_22]: I know, I know.

1120
01:25:38,091 --> 01:25:43,476
[SPEAKER_22]: Here we are all sitting on the radio show we've been doing about DDR for the past three and a half years.

1121
01:25:44,697 --> 01:25:57,290
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyway, I'm curious also, I have to let you go soon because we're still getting a bunch of other calls, but what I want to ask you about real quick, as somebody who reviews games and has been doing it for a little while, what do you think about this whole Xbox 360 thing?

1122
01:25:57,470 --> 01:25:58,571
[SPEAKER_22]: Are you going to pick one up at launch?

1123
01:25:59,887 --> 01:26:08,970
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm not, because for one, I don't like the pricing structure in order to get the good system with the hard drive, I have to drop an extra hundred bucks.

1124
01:26:09,770 --> 01:26:21,174
[SPEAKER_00]: And so far, the games, especially the launch window, outside of Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion, there's really not much I'm looking forward to that I can't play on my normal Xbox.

1125
01:26:22,075 --> 01:26:22,595
[SPEAKER_22]: There you have it.

1126
01:26:23,515 --> 01:26:23,835
[SPEAKER_22]: All right.

1127
01:26:24,315 --> 01:26:25,936
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, Amal, thanks so much for calling in.

1128
01:26:26,036 --> 01:26:27,116
[SPEAKER_22]: It's really good to hear from you.

1129
01:26:27,257 --> 01:26:28,237
[SPEAKER_22]: Don't be a stranger, all right?

1130
01:26:29,011 --> 01:26:29,311
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

1131
01:26:29,391 --> 01:26:31,111
[SPEAKER_22]: And when's that EX2 review going to be up?

1132
01:26:33,272 --> 01:26:36,013
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully during this week, if I can manage it.

1133
01:26:36,193 --> 01:26:36,453
[SPEAKER_22]: All right.

1134
01:26:36,513 --> 01:26:37,013
[SPEAKER_22]: Sounds good.

1135
01:26:37,753 --> 01:26:40,574
[SPEAKER_22]: Elmo from InsidePulse.com, thank you so much for calling in.

1136
01:26:40,614 --> 01:26:41,314
[SPEAKER_22]: Have a good week, okay?

1137
01:26:42,334 --> 01:26:42,634
[SPEAKER_00]: You too.

1138
01:26:42,694 --> 01:26:42,894
[SPEAKER_22]: All right.

1139
01:26:42,934 --> 01:26:43,114
[SPEAKER_22]: Later.

1140
01:26:44,955 --> 01:26:46,095
[SPEAKER_22]: We're going to go to another call now.

1141
01:26:46,175 --> 01:26:48,815
[SPEAKER_22]: Let's go to – I want to pick up somebody new here.

1142
01:26:48,855 --> 01:26:50,316
[SPEAKER_22]: This one's been trying to get in for a little while here.

1143
01:26:51,056 --> 01:26:52,176
[SPEAKER_22]: Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1144
01:26:54,237 --> 01:26:55,477
[SPEAKER_22]: Oops, did I actually answer the call?

1145
01:26:55,517 --> 01:26:55,917
[SPEAKER_22]: Probably not.

1146
01:26:57,219 --> 01:26:57,479
[SPEAKER_22]: Hello?

1147
01:26:58,260 --> 01:26:59,280
[SPEAKER_22]: Did I pick both of them up?

1148
01:27:00,401 --> 01:27:01,181
[SPEAKER_22]: I picked up the wrong one.

1149
01:27:01,201 --> 01:27:01,582
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, that's right.

1150
01:27:01,622 --> 01:27:02,622
[SPEAKER_22]: Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.

1151
01:27:04,904 --> 01:27:05,264
[SPEAKER_22]: Hello?

1152
01:27:06,825 --> 01:27:09,586
[SPEAKER_22]: This is the one whose connection wasn't working quite right earlier.

1153
01:27:10,067 --> 01:27:11,728
[SPEAKER_22]: Still can't hear you, buddy.

1154
01:27:11,908 --> 01:27:12,688
[SPEAKER_22]: Still can't hear you, buddy.

1155
01:27:12,728 --> 01:27:13,469
[SPEAKER_22]: Try it again, alright?

1156
01:27:15,510 --> 01:27:16,390
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, let's... Oh, damn.

1157
01:27:16,931 --> 01:27:17,891
[SPEAKER_22]: There was the one I was going to pick up.

1158
01:27:17,931 --> 01:27:18,912
[SPEAKER_22]: Let's pick up...

1159
01:27:22,288 --> 01:27:23,228
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't see that one coming in.

1160
01:27:24,789 --> 01:27:25,549
[SPEAKER_22]: Let's pick up this one.

1161
01:27:26,410 --> 01:27:27,250
[SPEAKER_22]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1162
01:27:29,491 --> 01:27:30,891
[SPEAKER_22]: Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1163
01:27:33,632 --> 01:27:33,973
[SPEAKER_22]: Hello?

1164
01:27:34,293 --> 01:27:34,653
[SPEAKER_22]: Hello!

1165
01:27:35,893 --> 01:27:36,233
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.

1166
01:27:36,374 --> 01:27:36,654
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi!

1167
01:27:39,595 --> 01:27:39,955
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you hear me?

1168
01:27:39,975 --> 01:27:40,075
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi!

1169
01:27:40,235 --> 01:27:40,595
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi!

1170
01:27:40,735 --> 01:27:41,736
[SPEAKER_03]: You're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1171
01:27:44,117 --> 01:27:47,678
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I'm... I think...

1172
01:27:48,911 --> 01:27:49,351
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this Roz?

1173
01:27:49,391 --> 01:27:50,171
[SPEAKER_22]: Massive lag.

1174
01:27:50,572 --> 01:27:51,532
[SPEAKER_22]: No, this isn't Roz.

1175
01:27:51,592 --> 01:27:52,392
[SPEAKER_22]: This is somebody else.

1176
01:27:52,612 --> 01:27:52,992
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello?

1177
01:27:53,193 --> 01:27:54,873
[SPEAKER_22]: Hi, I think there's massive lag.

1178
01:27:54,933 --> 01:27:55,753
[SPEAKER_22]: What's on your mind?

1179
01:27:55,934 --> 01:27:58,194
[SPEAKER_22]: And we'll answer your question or whatever's on your mind.

1180
01:27:58,234 --> 01:27:58,775
[SPEAKER_22]: Tell us what's up.

1181
01:28:02,196 --> 01:28:04,377
[SPEAKER_20]: We have to wait a little bit for the lag here.

1182
01:28:04,577 --> 01:28:05,497
[SPEAKER_22]: Let's see what this person has to say.

1183
01:28:05,517 --> 01:28:05,857
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.

1184
01:28:06,017 --> 01:28:06,257
[SPEAKER_22]: Hi.

1185
01:28:09,018 --> 01:28:11,079
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, is it working?

1186
01:28:12,339 --> 01:28:13,300
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, it's working.

1187
01:28:13,340 --> 01:28:14,400
[SPEAKER_22]: Hurry up and ask your question.

1188
01:28:14,440 --> 01:28:14,940
[SPEAKER_22]: What's on your mind?

1189
01:28:15,200 --> 01:28:16,061
[SPEAKER_22]: Just ask your question.

1190
01:28:16,101 --> 01:28:16,421
[SPEAKER_22]: What's up?

1191
01:28:17,898 --> 01:28:20,741
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I don't play music games that much.

1192
01:28:21,141 --> 01:28:21,441
[SPEAKER_22]: Uh-huh.

1193
01:28:22,963 --> 01:28:28,588
[SPEAKER_03]: But... But I don't... So I don't know what you're talking about.

1194
01:28:29,693 --> 01:28:32,036
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, this is Orange Lounge Radio.

1195
01:28:32,136 --> 01:28:40,745
[SPEAKER_22]: Our Sunday night program was actually, the station kind of started, it has to do with, you know, because the name Orange Lounge actually comes from music-based video games.

1196
01:28:40,785 --> 01:28:47,091
[SPEAKER_22]: And that's kind of how we grew into kind of what we're doing here is that we started by talking about music video games.

1197
01:28:47,131 --> 01:28:51,796
[SPEAKER_22]: So this Sunday night show that we do is kind of a throwback to the music

1198
01:28:52,697 --> 01:28:53,237
[SPEAKER_22]: Thanks for watching!

1199
01:29:13,663 --> 01:29:14,064
[SPEAKER_22]: Thanks for watching!

1200
01:29:33,783 --> 01:29:34,183
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura

1201
01:30:04,005 --> 01:30:06,207
[SPEAKER_22]: Hello, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.

1202
01:30:06,988 --> 01:30:07,469
[SPEAKER_22]: Can you hear us?

1203
01:30:08,630 --> 01:30:10,352
[SPEAKER_22]: Turn down your speakers.

1204
01:30:10,432 --> 01:30:12,614
[SPEAKER_22]: If you can hear us, we cannot hear you, my friend.

1205
01:30:12,654 --> 01:30:13,315
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, wait, wait.

1206
01:30:13,896 --> 01:30:15,017
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to send an IM real quick.

1207
01:30:15,782 --> 01:30:16,822
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

1208
01:30:16,842 --> 01:30:19,304
[SPEAKER_22]: Just a reminder, because we had a lot of new people calling in tonight.

1209
01:30:19,784 --> 01:30:21,465
[SPEAKER_22]: Maybe somebody can post this in the chat room as well.

1210
01:30:22,285 --> 01:30:25,586
[SPEAKER_22]: The first time, before the first time you call, it's always a good idea to call.

1211
01:30:25,886 --> 01:30:27,687
[SPEAKER_22]: It's a username on Skype, Echo123.

1212
01:30:28,348 --> 01:30:34,090
[SPEAKER_22]: And then that way you can test your connection and see if you can hear yourself, because that's a really good way to test the connection.

1213
01:30:34,530 --> 01:30:36,211
[SPEAKER_22]: Let me try one more time here.

1214
01:30:36,411 --> 01:30:36,911
[SPEAKER_22]: Are you there?

1215
01:30:37,972 --> 01:30:38,372
[SPEAKER_22]: Can you hear us?

1216
01:30:40,711 --> 01:30:41,191
[SPEAKER_22]: Hello!

1217
01:30:41,491 --> 01:30:41,852
[SPEAKER_22]: Hi!

1218
01:30:42,272 --> 01:30:42,692
[SPEAKER_22]: Who's this?

1219
01:30:44,093 --> 01:30:44,913
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, this is Roz.

1220
01:30:45,133 --> 01:30:45,773
[SPEAKER_22]: Hi Roz!

1221
01:30:45,853 --> 01:30:46,514
[SPEAKER_22]: What's on your mind?

1222
01:30:49,555 --> 01:30:50,716
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, just fine.

1223
01:30:52,616 --> 01:30:53,217
[SPEAKER_22]: How you doing?

1224
01:30:53,617 --> 01:30:54,998
[SPEAKER_22]: Do you got a question for us?

1225
01:30:55,158 --> 01:30:56,218
[SPEAKER_22]: What are you calling in about tonight?

1226
01:30:56,238 --> 01:30:56,778
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't hear us.

1227
01:30:58,399 --> 01:30:59,099
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't hear me.

1228
01:30:59,119 --> 01:31:00,460
[SPEAKER_06]: I can hear you.

1229
01:31:02,021 --> 01:31:02,121
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh.

1230
01:31:03,880 --> 01:31:06,002
[SPEAKER_22]: Is the call lagged by like 45 seconds?

1231
01:31:06,883 --> 01:31:08,564
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, maybe we're a little lagged.

1232
01:31:08,584 --> 01:31:12,827
[SPEAKER_22]: I think the call was incredibly lagged here because I think she's just now getting the stuff we said in the beginning.

1233
01:31:13,168 --> 01:31:14,649
[SPEAKER_22]: Roz, I'm going to have to let you go for right now.

1234
01:31:14,689 --> 01:31:17,111
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm really sorry, but try calling us back in a little while.

1235
01:31:17,571 --> 01:31:18,792
[SPEAKER_22]: Something's up with the connection tonight.

1236
01:31:19,132 --> 01:31:19,773
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know what's going on.

1237
01:31:19,793 --> 01:31:23,096
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm still here, yeah.

1238
01:31:23,276 --> 01:31:24,116
[SPEAKER_22]: Maybe she'll get to the question.

1239
01:31:26,118 --> 01:31:27,900
[SPEAKER_22]: The question part should be coming up now on the call.

1240
01:31:28,760 --> 01:31:30,041
[SPEAKER_22]: Live radio, everybody.

1241
01:31:30,522 --> 01:31:33,324
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, she's getting lagged.

1242
01:31:33,527 --> 01:31:34,808
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, I figure it's probably really lagged.

1243
01:31:40,675 --> 01:31:45,300
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, we're going to have to go ahead and let Roz go for right now, but hopefully she'll give us a call back a little later in the program.

1244
01:31:46,001 --> 01:31:47,522
[SPEAKER_22]: Let's try to go to this call.

1245
01:31:47,642 --> 01:31:49,945
[SPEAKER_22]: Remember guys, Echo 1-2-3, unfortunately lagged.

1246
01:31:49,965 --> 01:31:52,888
[SPEAKER_22]: There's not a whole lot we can do about, but we'll give it a try.

1247
01:31:53,469 --> 01:31:54,330
[SPEAKER_22]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1248
01:31:55,518 --> 01:31:55,878
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, hi.

1249
01:31:56,219 --> 01:31:56,559
[SPEAKER_21]: Hi.

1250
01:31:57,660 --> 01:32:00,642
[SPEAKER_21]: Hold on, I'm getting an echo because I'm still listening to your show.

1251
01:32:00,662 --> 01:32:01,343
[SPEAKER_21]: That's all right.

1252
01:32:01,743 --> 01:32:02,784
[SPEAKER_22]: Luckily, we don't hear it.

1253
01:32:02,864 --> 01:32:07,127
[SPEAKER_22]: And I'm very happy that we're picking up a call that's unlagged and we can hear the person just fine.

1254
01:32:07,548 --> 01:32:08,068
[SPEAKER_22]: It's all good.

1255
01:32:08,148 --> 01:32:10,030
[SPEAKER_22]: So go ahead and turn that down.

1256
01:32:10,150 --> 01:32:11,131
[SPEAKER_22]: And what's on your mind?

1257
01:32:13,653 --> 01:32:13,853
[SPEAKER_22]: Um...

1258
01:32:15,740 --> 01:32:16,581
[SPEAKER_21]: Actually, I don't really know.

1259
01:32:17,222 --> 01:32:18,363
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, well, who's this?

1260
01:32:18,443 --> 01:32:19,204
[SPEAKER_21]: Introduce yourself.

1261
01:32:20,725 --> 01:32:22,947
[SPEAKER_21]: This is Xander from Florida.

1262
01:32:22,967 --> 01:32:24,008
[SPEAKER_21]: Hi, Xander.

1263
01:32:25,450 --> 01:32:26,351
[SPEAKER_21]: Hi, Xander from Florida.

1264
01:32:27,051 --> 01:32:29,153
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, there's a massive time difference.

1265
01:32:29,214 --> 01:32:30,175
[SPEAKER_21]: It's like 11 o'clock here.

1266
01:32:30,575 --> 01:32:31,856
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm staying up way past my bedtime.

1267
01:32:32,577 --> 01:32:33,077
[SPEAKER_22]: I know.

1268
01:32:33,438 --> 01:32:38,583
[SPEAKER_22]: We really kind of screw over our East Coast fans with the timing of this show, but the problem is that, you know...

1269
01:32:40,164 --> 01:32:45,825
[SPEAKER_22]: We're all people that work during the week, Monday through Friday, so Saturday and Sunday are kind of like our days off.

1270
01:32:45,885 --> 01:32:53,166
[SPEAKER_22]: So if we were to do our show at like 4.30 or a time that would cater more to the East Coast folks, we would pretty much be losing a day of our weekend.

1271
01:32:53,226 --> 01:32:55,607
[SPEAKER_22]: So that's unfortunately why we have to do it early.

1272
01:32:55,627 --> 01:32:57,967
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, later on.

1273
01:32:58,147 --> 01:32:59,968
[SPEAKER_22]: And we aren't paid well enough to do it early.

1274
01:32:59,988 --> 01:33:01,568
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, we don't get paid for this crap either.

1275
01:33:02,928 --> 01:33:07,529
[SPEAKER_22]: But of course, that's another reason why we do the podcast, is so that folks can download that whenever they want.

1276
01:33:08,789 --> 01:33:10,793
[SPEAKER_22]: So, I'm assuming you heard about the show through the podcast?

1277
01:33:12,155 --> 01:33:14,699
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, no, actually, I heard about it through DDR Freak.

1278
01:33:14,939 --> 01:33:21,230
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, right on, okay, yeah, we got a lot of folks from DDR Freak, because, you know, people whore... I haven't warned you for anything yet, have I?

1279
01:33:22,768 --> 01:33:23,608
[SPEAKER_21]: No, actually, I don't.

1280
01:33:23,708 --> 01:33:24,569
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm not on the forums.

1281
01:33:24,669 --> 01:33:25,329
[SPEAKER_21]: I just, you know.

1282
01:33:25,569 --> 01:33:26,009
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1283
01:33:26,029 --> 01:33:26,809
[SPEAKER_06]: He's a lurker.

1284
01:33:26,869 --> 01:33:27,670
[SPEAKER_06]: I will if you want me to.

1285
01:33:27,910 --> 01:33:28,650
[SPEAKER_21]: He's a lurker.

1286
01:33:28,750 --> 01:33:29,270
[SPEAKER_06]: He's a voyeur.

1287
01:33:29,290 --> 01:33:30,111
[SPEAKER_21]: He just watches.

1288
01:33:30,131 --> 01:33:31,111
[SPEAKER_21]: That's awesome.

1289
01:33:31,151 --> 01:33:32,331
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm a lurker on a lot of stuff.

1290
01:33:32,592 --> 01:33:33,072
[SPEAKER_21]: That's good.

1291
01:33:33,132 --> 01:33:33,432
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1292
01:33:33,572 --> 01:33:34,992
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay, we have a stalker.

1293
01:33:37,353 --> 01:33:39,154
[SPEAKER_21]: I wanted to talk to Jamie about in the group.

1294
01:33:39,714 --> 01:33:41,655
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, uh-oh, uh-oh, I'm in trouble.

1295
01:33:41,795 --> 01:33:43,336
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, what's up?

1296
01:33:44,216 --> 01:33:52,621
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, um, I'm a big fan of In The Groove, and I would say that you are massively wrong in saying that it is a rip-off.

1297
01:33:52,841 --> 01:33:55,562
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, let me finish, let me finish.

1298
01:33:55,802 --> 01:33:56,022
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes?

1299
01:33:57,263 --> 01:33:57,823
[SPEAKER_21]: Go ahead.

1300
01:33:58,003 --> 01:34:00,345
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I find it much more fun than DDR.

1301
01:34:00,585 --> 01:34:01,565
[SPEAKER_06]: How is it not a rip-off?

1302
01:34:03,086 --> 01:34:06,468
[SPEAKER_02]: Well... And I want examples, item by item.

1303
01:34:07,588 --> 01:34:08,849
[SPEAKER_22]: Hold on, let the man finish his thoughts.

1304
01:34:11,481 --> 01:34:15,705
[SPEAKER_22]: What is more fun for you for In The Groove as opposed to DDR?

1305
01:34:15,785 --> 01:34:20,970
[SPEAKER_22]: Once I got to about the 9-footers in DDR, it got kind of boring for me because it just kind of stagnated.

1306
01:34:28,537 --> 01:34:34,500
[SPEAKER_21]: at that point, and then the 10s, there's too much of a gap between the 9s and the 10s, so it's too hard to get into, like, the max and stuff.

1307
01:34:35,420 --> 01:34:44,424
[SPEAKER_21]: So, I found within the groove, you have much harder 9s on Expert, and easier 10s, so the gap is kind of closed, and I can have a lot more fun in between.

1308
01:34:45,184 --> 01:34:50,807
[SPEAKER_21]: Which is basically where I am, so... Just out of curiosity, do you play on controller or play on actual dance pad?

1309
01:34:51,287 --> 01:34:54,008
[SPEAKER_21]: No, I play on the dance mat.

1310
01:34:54,408 --> 01:34:55,349
[SPEAKER_21]: What dance mat are you using?

1311
01:34:56,569 --> 01:35:00,153
[SPEAKER_21]: The Red Octane, the foam mat.

1312
01:35:00,573 --> 01:35:01,834
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, my Ignition 3.0.

1313
01:35:02,795 --> 01:35:03,095
[SPEAKER_22]: Ignition 3.0.

1314
01:35:03,456 --> 01:35:04,176
[SPEAKER_22]: No, 2.0.

1315
01:35:04,977 --> 01:35:05,437
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, 2.0.

1316
01:35:05,637 --> 01:35:19,470
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, so for you, the thing that makes In The Groove a little more exciting than DDR is the fact that there's more middle ground, like 9.5 level step patterns, that some of the step patterns cater more to an advanced level.

1317
01:35:20,498 --> 01:35:22,100
[SPEAKER_21]: Right, and Charlene's awesome.

1318
01:35:22,540 --> 01:35:24,542
[SPEAKER_06]: That's never been my point.

1319
01:35:24,582 --> 01:35:28,305
[SPEAKER_06]: My point is that it took something and basically stole the idea.

1320
01:35:29,346 --> 01:35:33,870
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm very much one for innovation, and there is no innovation.

1321
01:35:33,910 --> 01:35:35,051
[SPEAKER_06]: They basically took the DDR.

1322
01:35:35,071 --> 01:35:36,352
[SPEAKER_21]: They have the hands and the minds.

1323
01:35:37,361 --> 01:35:41,863
[SPEAKER_21]: And they're willing to do much harder songs than Konami was ever willing to do with DDR.

1324
01:35:42,164 --> 01:35:49,207
[SPEAKER_06]: But the fact remains that you take a game using four arrows that you have to step on in pattern.

1325
01:35:50,108 --> 01:35:55,450
[SPEAKER_21]: Are you going to say the same thing about Dragon Warrior and Final Fantasy?

1326
01:35:55,590 --> 01:35:58,472
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, they're the same style of game, but that doesn't mean they're a ripoff of each other.

1327
01:36:00,183 --> 01:36:07,388
[SPEAKER_06]: The systems were actually... You can't compare RPGs that come out at the same time.

1328
01:36:07,428 --> 01:36:12,611
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be like comparing Grindio with Final Fantasy, even though they have two different combat systems.

1329
01:36:12,651 --> 01:36:18,856
[SPEAKER_22]: I've heard a similar argument to this before, and it's saying that you don't say Mario and Sonic is the common one I hear.

1330
01:36:18,876 --> 01:36:25,160
[SPEAKER_22]: But for me, honestly, Mario and Sonic is not the accurate comparison when it comes to In the Groove and DDR for me.

1331
01:36:25,200 --> 01:36:28,942
[SPEAKER_22]: It's Mario and this old Commodore 64 game called The Great Gianna Sisters,

1332
01:36:30,383 --> 01:36:36,065
[SPEAKER_22]: was an awful lot like Mario Brothers, except they had like a couple, it was girls, and there was a couple extra things in it.

1333
01:36:36,125 --> 01:36:38,226
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like in here, Sonic and Jazz Jackrabbit.

1334
01:36:38,986 --> 01:36:39,287
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay?

1335
01:36:39,827 --> 01:36:51,411
[SPEAKER_06]: But the whole fact of the matter remains, and this is why to this day I will be against in the group, was the fact that they were saying, hey, take DDR machines and modify them.

1336
01:36:51,931 --> 01:36:52,732
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, let's break...

1337
01:36:53,932 --> 01:36:56,034
[SPEAKER_21]: That's why they have the dedicated cabinets now for In The Groove 2.

1338
01:36:56,554 --> 01:37:05,301
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, they have that now, but the whole fact remains that the origin of In The Groove was a rip-off and modification of DDR.

1339
01:37:06,061 --> 01:37:06,962
[SPEAKER_21]: And what about Step Mania?

1340
01:37:07,742 --> 01:37:09,544
[SPEAKER_06]: Step Mania was never marketed for sale.

1341
01:37:11,110 --> 01:37:13,672
[SPEAKER_22]: In the Groove is kind of Stepmania marketed for sale in a way.

1342
01:37:13,712 --> 01:37:14,732
[SPEAKER_22]: You could argue that.

1343
01:37:14,813 --> 01:37:22,519
[SPEAKER_06]: Had Stepmania been released as an item for sale, which is why I was against those kits that they were selling on eBay, the same thing.

1344
01:37:22,999 --> 01:37:24,020
[SPEAKER_06]: It is a ripoff.

1345
01:37:24,280 --> 01:37:27,983
[SPEAKER_06]: It is stealing proprietary information from Konami.

1346
01:37:30,285 --> 01:37:31,446
[SPEAKER_02]: That is where my point is.

1347
01:37:32,006 --> 01:37:37,211
[SPEAKER_06]: And to this day, I will consider In the Groove a cheap knockoff because they will not admit their fault.

1348
01:37:37,810 --> 01:37:48,608
[SPEAKER_22]: Despite the fact, now to play devil's advocate here with our caller a little bit, despite the fact that In The Groove might have some more challenging steps and songs that appeal to a different audience.

1349
01:37:50,155 --> 01:37:54,517
[SPEAKER_06]: I will give it that it's got interesting stuff, although the earlier level steps were actually complete crap.

1350
01:37:55,417 --> 01:37:56,597
[SPEAKER_06]: I do like some of the music better.

1351
01:37:58,358 --> 01:38:03,620
[SPEAKER_06]: The only reason that I didn't play anything harder on In the Groove when I played it is I was fresh off of a car accident.

1352
01:38:04,420 --> 01:38:08,741
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I was having this issue with my hip pointing to dislocate itself every time I stepped funny.

1353
01:38:10,102 --> 01:38:11,962
[SPEAKER_06]: So I didn't get a chance to try anything harder.

1354
01:38:12,002 --> 01:38:13,943
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not saying it's not a fun game.

1355
01:38:14,443 --> 01:38:16,064
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not saying it doesn't offer challenge.

1356
01:38:16,224 --> 01:38:19,305
[SPEAKER_06]: My whole point comes with the origin of the game, and that's why I'm against it.

1357
01:38:19,625 --> 01:38:23,149
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't believe in thievery in the industry Why don't you like the game?

1358
01:38:35,183 --> 01:38:36,023
[SPEAKER_22]: What I don't like about the game?

1359
01:38:36,163 --> 01:38:38,024
[SPEAKER_22]: First off, the interface is extremely plain.

1360
01:38:38,044 --> 01:38:41,826
[SPEAKER_22]: It looks like whoever made the skin crapped it out in about five minutes.

1361
01:38:42,026 --> 01:38:43,447
[SPEAKER_22]: The songs are all very generic.

1362
01:38:43,507 --> 01:38:46,568
[SPEAKER_22]: They sound very alike, and it's just really generic sounding stuff.

1363
01:38:47,268 --> 01:38:48,349
[SPEAKER_22]: The step patterns suck.

1364
01:38:48,429 --> 01:38:49,069
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't like them.

1365
01:38:49,769 --> 01:38:53,691
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't like the fact that there are hands and feet, or whatever, you know, the hands part of it.

1366
01:38:54,051 --> 01:38:54,611
[SPEAKER_22]: It's retarded.

1367
01:38:54,711 --> 01:38:56,152
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't like the feet, Loki.

1368
01:38:56,252 --> 01:39:02,436
[SPEAKER_06]: I was kind of against the whole involvement of the eye toy for DDR.

1369
01:39:02,456 --> 01:39:06,018
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm talking about the three steps at once, or the four steps at once.

1370
01:39:06,118 --> 01:39:06,778
[SPEAKER_22]: It's retarded.

1371
01:39:06,878 --> 01:39:07,979
[SPEAKER_22]: It's just like, pump it up.

1372
01:39:08,099 --> 01:39:10,080
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, and I hate it in Pump It Up.

1373
01:39:10,240 --> 01:39:11,921
[SPEAKER_22]: I hate Pump It Up, the way they have that.

1374
01:39:12,361 --> 01:39:18,605
[SPEAKER_22]: Although I like, you know what, I really, really like that recent pump release for Home because it's an awesome dance game, it really is.

1375
01:39:18,965 --> 01:39:23,947
[SPEAKER_22]: But still, some of the steps in Pump It Up are just as asinine as Paranoia Survivor Max or The Water.

1376
01:39:23,967 --> 01:39:26,509
[SPEAKER_22]: All I said was it didn't look like they put that much polish in it.

1377
01:39:27,089 --> 01:39:27,409
[SPEAKER_22]: That's it.

1378
01:39:27,549 --> 01:39:30,471
[SPEAKER_22]: And in the group too, I'm sorry, they didn't put that much polish into that one either.

1379
01:39:30,511 --> 01:39:31,692
[SPEAKER_22]: They just changed the interface.

1380
01:39:31,732 --> 01:39:40,997
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I could have also made a better cover with an afternoon in Illustrator with my, like, all of, you know, five week skill in Illustrator than they did.

1381
01:39:41,317 --> 01:39:41,938
[SPEAKER_22]: To each his own.

1382
01:39:41,958 --> 01:39:43,579
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, I don't care if you play the game.

1383
01:39:43,639 --> 01:39:45,500
[SPEAKER_22]: I think it's cool if you're supporting another company.

1384
01:39:45,580 --> 01:39:46,481
[SPEAKER_22]: Hey, you know what?

1385
01:39:46,601 --> 01:39:53,767
[SPEAKER_22]: There needs to be more dancing games out there, and just maybe deviate a little bit more from DDR than you did before.

1386
01:39:53,947 --> 01:39:55,908
[SPEAKER_06]: I know what will make everybody happy.

1387
01:39:55,968 --> 01:39:58,030
[SPEAKER_06]: We have DDR Food Mix.

1388
01:39:58,450 --> 01:40:03,754
[SPEAKER_06]: They just hire the Food Mix people and say, make us a DDR mix and market that, and then everyone will be happy.

1389
01:40:03,794 --> 01:40:04,655
[SPEAKER_22]: But it'd still be a rip-off.

1390
01:40:05,396 --> 01:40:06,437
[SPEAKER_06]: I said Konami needs to.

1391
01:40:06,977 --> 01:40:09,099
[SPEAKER_21]: It's a rip-off within the same company, though.

1392
01:40:09,139 --> 01:40:10,220
[SPEAKER_21]: That's kind of her point.

1393
01:40:11,300 --> 01:40:13,822
[SPEAKER_06]: But if Konami releases it, it's not a rip-off.

1394
01:40:13,902 --> 01:40:15,523
[SPEAKER_22]: I miss the Konami doing it part.

1395
01:40:15,543 --> 01:40:17,305
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it's Konami's intellectual property.

1396
01:40:18,025 --> 01:40:21,848
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright, this discussion's been going on an awful long time.

1397
01:40:21,888 --> 01:40:27,072
[SPEAKER_06]: All I want is for the in-the-group fans to admit that it's a rip-off.

1398
01:40:28,359 --> 01:40:29,540
[SPEAKER_22]: I completely respect your opinion, by the way.

1399
01:40:45,731 --> 01:40:46,391
[SPEAKER_22]: All right, that's good.

1400
01:40:46,591 --> 01:40:47,392
[SPEAKER_06]: Even if I disagree.

1401
01:40:47,752 --> 01:40:48,552
[SPEAKER_22]: All right, later, dude.

1402
01:40:49,673 --> 01:40:49,973
[SPEAKER_22]: All right.

1403
01:40:50,853 --> 01:40:51,494
[SPEAKER_22]: Very interesting.

1404
01:40:51,814 --> 01:40:54,135
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just like, you know, I just don't care.

1405
01:40:54,575 --> 01:40:54,895
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't.

1406
01:40:55,415 --> 01:40:56,976
[SPEAKER_06]: But honestly, it's the same.

1407
01:40:57,016 --> 01:40:59,337
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm not even adamant about pointing out that it's a ripoff.

1408
01:40:59,357 --> 01:40:59,857
[SPEAKER_06]: Who cares?

1409
01:41:00,418 --> 01:41:00,798
[SPEAKER_06]: Who cares?

1410
01:41:00,878 --> 01:41:05,620
[SPEAKER_06]: That's actually all I care about is people admitting that they basically stole.

1411
01:41:05,900 --> 01:41:07,961
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it should all come out in the courts pretty soon.

1412
01:41:08,061 --> 01:41:12,224
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, not pretty soon, but... Yeah, as soon as Rockstar gets the Smackdown laid on him, sure.

1413
01:41:12,724 --> 01:41:13,945
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright, new topic, new topic.

1414
01:41:13,965 --> 01:41:16,346
[SPEAKER_22]: Let's see if our next call... I'm going to try this guy one more time here.

1415
01:41:16,366 --> 01:41:17,947
[SPEAKER_22]: Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.

1416
01:41:18,148 --> 01:41:20,309
[SPEAKER_22]: Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.

1417
01:41:20,329 --> 01:41:23,731
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not even adamant about, like, pointing out... Feedback!

1418
01:41:24,131 --> 01:41:25,292
[SPEAKER_22]: We got really bad feedback there.

1419
01:41:25,312 --> 01:41:26,573
[SPEAKER_22]: Turn down your speakers.

1420
01:41:27,053 --> 01:41:28,754
[SPEAKER_22]: Hello?

1421
01:41:28,995 --> 01:41:29,255
[SPEAKER_22]: Hello?

1422
01:41:29,815 --> 01:41:30,135
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

1423
01:41:30,896 --> 01:41:32,217
[SPEAKER_20]: Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.

1424
01:41:32,677 --> 01:41:34,118
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, you guys are really choppy.

1425
01:41:35,570 --> 01:41:36,051
[SPEAKER_20]: It happens.

1426
01:41:36,131 --> 01:41:37,772
[SPEAKER_22]: Skype is really weird.

1427
01:41:38,132 --> 01:41:39,273
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright.

1428
01:41:40,253 --> 01:41:42,394
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, hey, first time caller.

1429
01:41:44,436 --> 01:41:45,576
[SPEAKER_22]: What's on your mind, my friend?

1430
01:41:45,596 --> 01:41:45,897
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright.

1431
01:41:45,917 --> 01:41:47,258
[SPEAKER_20]: Main reason I called in...

1432
01:41:52,532 --> 01:42:07,553
[SPEAKER_20]: Assuming that I don't win an Xbox 360 from the whole Mountain Dew, Pepsi, win an Xbox 360 every 10 minutes thing that I've been religiously collecting money for, should I sell my PSP?

1433
01:42:08,240 --> 01:42:10,881
[SPEAKER_20]: to help fund an Xbox 360 in your opinion?

1434
01:42:12,242 --> 01:42:19,644
[SPEAKER_22]: We're going to have to hang up on you because of the feedback, but keep listening.

1435
01:42:20,765 --> 01:42:26,327
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright, so keep listening because we're going to get to this guy's call here, and we're just getting really bad feedback on that call, but we want to answer the question.

1436
01:42:26,367 --> 01:42:33,450
[SPEAKER_22]: So the question was, assuming that I cannot win an Xbox 360 through the every 10 minutes competition that's going on, which

1437
01:42:34,410 --> 01:42:36,793
[SPEAKER_22]: You're not going to win one.

1438
01:42:36,853 --> 01:42:39,556
[SPEAKER_22]: If you do win one, hats off to you.

1439
01:42:39,917 --> 01:42:42,940
[SPEAKER_22]: Every nerd drinks Mountain Dew unless they're on a diet.

1440
01:42:43,340 --> 01:42:47,565
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a nerd and I don't drink Mountain Dew because I think it tastes like pee.

1441
01:42:47,585 --> 01:42:52,291
[SPEAKER_22]: You have a better chance of getting a 360 doing one of those referral programs than you would doing the...

1442
01:42:52,751 --> 01:42:55,832
[SPEAKER_06]: You have a better chance of getting a 360 by saving up the money and buying one.

1443
01:42:55,852 --> 01:42:57,093
[SPEAKER_22]: Not to knock it, though, dude.

1444
01:42:57,353 --> 01:42:59,674
[SPEAKER_22]: If you're going to try that way, have fun with it.

1445
01:42:59,774 --> 01:43:03,095
[SPEAKER_22]: And Mountain Dew, I like Mountain Dew, but it's too many calories for me.

1446
01:43:03,415 --> 01:43:04,775
[SPEAKER_22]: How dumb do I sound?

1447
01:43:04,795 --> 01:43:09,417
[SPEAKER_06]: But back to the subject, the thing is, should he sell his PSP to get an Xbox 360?

1448
01:43:09,957 --> 01:43:14,799
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that you should sell your PSP to get a Turbo Express, because Better Games came out on the Turbo Duo.

1449
01:43:16,620 --> 01:43:19,441
[SPEAKER_22]: No, they need to bring back my LiveWire, because I love that.

1450
01:43:20,122 --> 01:43:21,925
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't want to drink Shasta.

1451
01:43:33,800 --> 01:43:36,682
[SPEAKER_22]: Should I sell a PSP to get an Xbox 360?

1452
01:43:37,042 --> 01:43:41,546
[SPEAKER_22]: Here's the golden rule of gaming, and we've said this if you're going to judge a system time and time again.

1453
01:43:42,006 --> 01:43:45,328
[SPEAKER_22]: A system is only as good as the games that they put out on it.

1454
01:43:45,989 --> 01:43:46,850
[SPEAKER_06]: I have always said that.

1455
01:43:46,950 --> 01:43:51,053
[SPEAKER_22]: I know you have, and I'm repeating it because it's the golden rule of gaming, and I say apply it here.

1456
01:43:51,693 --> 01:43:53,354
[SPEAKER_22]: Look at the games that are coming out for Xbox 360.

1457
01:43:54,455 --> 01:43:55,677
[SPEAKER_22]: Are you into racing games?

1458
01:43:55,797 --> 01:43:57,099
[SPEAKER_22]: Are you into sports games?

1459
01:43:57,219 --> 01:43:58,821
[SPEAKER_22]: Is Gun something that interests you?

1460
01:43:58,881 --> 01:44:00,824
[SPEAKER_22]: Is Dead or Alive series something that interests you?

1461
01:44:01,285 --> 01:44:04,870
[SPEAKER_22]: If these are games that interest you, Xbox 360 is the way to go.

1462
01:44:06,076 --> 01:44:24,694
[SPEAKER_22]: If, on the other hand, you're more into the types of things you can do on a handheld and the things that are going to be coming out for PSP, if you want the new Katamari PSP game, if you want Metal Gear Acid 2 and the tactical games and more portable things, and you like to watch movies on the go, then PSP is more for you.

1463
01:44:25,635 --> 01:44:30,799
[SPEAKER_22]: So, while we can kind of make a decision based on what our preference would be,

1464
01:44:32,633 --> 01:44:33,913
[SPEAKER_22]: Honestly, I couldn't decide.

1465
01:44:34,934 --> 01:44:58,260
[SPEAKER_22]: Honestly, if this were me, if I were absolutely poor and I had no way to afford these games right now, I didn't have a job, I was unemployed, so I had to cut back on my gaming, regardless or not, like it or not, I would probably hold on to my PSP for right now and stick it out a little bit longer because there's really nothing that's coming out for the 360 for me right now that's making me go, oh my gosh,

1466
01:44:58,800 --> 01:45:00,101
[SPEAKER_22]: I have to have this right now.

1467
01:45:00,121 --> 01:45:04,965
[SPEAKER_22]: And what if you get the 360 and then the PS3 comes out and you're like, oh crap, I wanted to get that instead.

1468
01:45:05,125 --> 01:45:05,485
[SPEAKER_22]: Exactly.

1469
01:45:05,525 --> 01:45:08,307
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, I would wait until this stuff comes out.

1470
01:45:08,548 --> 01:45:11,510
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, honestly, it doesn't look like there's that much stuff coming at launch.

1471
01:45:12,677 --> 01:45:14,639
[SPEAKER_22]: and just stick with the PSP for now.

1472
01:45:15,119 --> 01:45:18,862
[SPEAKER_22]: Especially if you're going to invest in the 360, you're going to be investing quite a bit of money.

1473
01:45:18,882 --> 01:45:19,863
[SPEAKER_22]: You know what, that's a really good idea.

1474
01:45:21,024 --> 01:45:27,590
[SPEAKER_22]: When the Xbox 360 comes out and you can play this at GameStop, EB Games, your favorite retailer, play the demos, maybe you can make a better decision at that point.

1475
01:45:27,850 --> 01:45:31,953
[SPEAKER_22]: There's no reason you have to get a 360 the day it comes out unless...

1476
01:45:32,793 --> 01:45:34,134
[SPEAKER_22]: There's just this game you're dying for.

1477
01:45:34,295 --> 01:45:38,739
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, I personally do not advocate trading in your systems or games unless the game is crap.

1478
01:45:39,560 --> 01:45:48,970
[SPEAKER_06]: For the simple reason, I often find moments where like, oh, I want to play this game and I'll go bust out the Neo Geo and freaking play King of Fighters 2000.

1479
01:45:49,931 --> 01:45:53,255
[SPEAKER_22]: How many people do we know that has sold back a system and then had to buy it again later?

1480
01:45:54,327 --> 01:45:56,490
[SPEAKER_06]: I know many, many folks.

1481
01:45:57,271 --> 01:45:58,011
[SPEAKER_22]: I've done it myself.

1482
01:45:58,091 --> 01:46:06,481
[SPEAKER_06]: And we ourselves, the only system that we have actually ever gotten rid of was our Nintendo 64, and we are borrowing somebody else's.

1483
01:46:07,415 --> 01:46:09,938
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I mean, it doesn't really matter.

1484
01:46:10,318 --> 01:46:24,695
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, there's been days where we've broken out the ColecoVision and freaking had a golf fest or played Venture, you know, only to put it up, you know, an hour later and break out the TurboGrafx and play a bunch of bonks.

1485
01:46:24,895 --> 01:46:26,176
[SPEAKER_22]: I think that's another good element to look at.

1486
01:46:26,216 --> 01:46:30,120
[SPEAKER_22]: If you're going to sell that PSP back, think to yourself, am I going to regret this later?

1487
01:46:30,180 --> 01:46:35,024
[SPEAKER_22]: Is there going to be a game coming out for PSP that I'm going to really, really want later?

1488
01:46:35,825 --> 01:46:37,506
[SPEAKER_22]: What the hell else is coming out on PSP?

1489
01:46:38,187 --> 01:46:40,209
[SPEAKER_22]: Loki, what are some of the big games coming out for PSP?

1490
01:46:41,687 --> 01:46:45,289
[SPEAKER_22]: That's a good one.

1491
01:46:45,309 --> 01:46:48,851
[SPEAKER_06]: Ooh, the gauntlet has been thrown in the chat room.

1492
01:46:49,091 --> 01:46:49,611
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, what happened?

1493
01:46:50,072 --> 01:46:51,392
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to label off my systems now.

1494
01:46:51,792 --> 01:46:52,053
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, okay.

1495
01:46:52,633 --> 01:46:53,313
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright, anyway.

1496
01:46:55,434 --> 01:46:58,516
[SPEAKER_22]: Before you sell back your PSP, make sure it's something you're not going to regret later on with the games.

1497
01:46:58,716 --> 01:47:01,838
[SPEAKER_22]: So, that's our really, really long-winded answer to your question.

1498
01:47:01,878 --> 01:47:06,460
[SPEAKER_22]: I hope you're able to still listen, and sorry we had to let you go there, but we were just getting too much feedback.

1499
01:47:06,560 --> 01:47:07,741
[SPEAKER_22]: Skype is being retarded today.

1500
01:47:07,761 --> 01:47:09,382
[SPEAKER_22]: Skype is being very bad tonight, so...

1501
01:47:09,482 --> 01:47:11,123
[SPEAKER_22]: Skype, Skype, I'm punishing Skype.

1502
01:47:11,303 --> 01:47:13,244
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm not punishing our listeners, but I'm punishing Skype.

1503
01:47:13,724 --> 01:47:16,226
[SPEAKER_22]: And we're going to sign into Do Not Disturb for a little while.

1504
01:47:16,406 --> 01:47:17,286
[SPEAKER_22]: That was the last Skype word.

1505
01:47:17,566 --> 01:47:17,747
[SPEAKER_22]: Huh?

1506
01:47:20,468 --> 01:47:20,708
[SPEAKER_22]: All right.

1507
01:47:21,409 --> 01:47:24,810
[SPEAKER_22]: So, again, if you want to give us feedback, you can always send us an email.

1508
01:47:25,131 --> 01:47:28,472
[SPEAKER_22]: You can always join our chat room, and we always try to get to this stuff on the show.

1509
01:47:28,873 --> 01:47:30,894
[SPEAKER_22]: www.orangeontrade.com, click on chat.

1510
01:47:31,254 --> 01:47:34,396
[SPEAKER_22]: I'd really like to hear from this guy what he thought of our feedback there.

1511
01:47:35,396 --> 01:47:36,257
[SPEAKER_22]: And, of course, our forums.

1512
01:47:37,217 --> 01:47:43,241
[SPEAKER_22]: I know I've been searching those forums non-stop lately on OrangeLunchRadio.com, and there's been some pretty neat posts and some good questions asked.

1513
01:47:43,601 --> 01:47:48,404
[SPEAKER_22]: And I, you know, if I'm bored, I always take time to state my opinion there on the forums.

1514
01:47:48,844 --> 01:47:51,546
[SPEAKER_22]: So check that out as well on OrangeLunchRadio.com.

1515
01:47:52,387 --> 01:47:52,647
[SPEAKER_22]: All right.

1516
01:47:54,628 --> 01:47:59,871
[SPEAKER_22]: And some folks in the chat room are crying because they didn't get through on Skype line, so we're really sorry, but we are punishing Skype for a little while.

1517
01:48:00,171 --> 01:48:02,773
[SPEAKER_22]: If we have some extra time at the end of the show, we'll come back to Skype, okay?

1518
01:48:02,833 --> 01:48:03,273
[SPEAKER_22]: We promise.

1519
01:48:03,774 --> 01:48:05,775
[SPEAKER_22]: But for now, we're long overdue for a break, you guys.

1520
01:48:06,513 --> 01:48:12,921
[SPEAKER_22]: So we're going to go to a break, and in this break, I think we're going to play something from... Oh, I don't know.

1521
01:48:12,961 --> 01:48:16,746
[SPEAKER_22]: How about an Outphase song from Beatmania 2DX?

1522
01:48:16,766 --> 01:48:18,448
[SPEAKER_22]: I haven't heard this in a long time.

1523
01:48:18,468 --> 01:48:21,232
[SPEAKER_22]: So we'll be back with more Orange Launch Radio after this, you guys.

1524
01:48:21,612 --> 01:48:21,993
[SPEAKER_22]: Stay tuned.

01:50:05,626 --> 01:50:07,949
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for watching!

1526
01:50:33,191 --> 01:50:35,845
Thank you for watching

1527
01:51:17,349 --> 01:51:31,361
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't give away everything you own Someone will give you back the innocence that you have lost Charlie, if you're getting a sister of mine Better stay off the drugs and the wine Don't get lost in the day

1528
01:52:04,232 --> 01:52:05,615
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for watching

1529
01:52:40,686 --> 01:52:42,095
Thanks for watching!

1530
01:53:19,649 --> 01:53:20,592
Thanks for watching!

1531
01:53:52,609 --> 01:53:53,389

1532
01:54:21,609 --> 01:54:24,674
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1533
01:55:02,186 --> 01:55:02,989
Thanks for watching!

1534
01:55:54,148 --> 01:55:59,954
[SPEAKER_17]: Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

1535
01:56:04,431 --> 01:56:06,492
[SPEAKER_22]: Hello, we're back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1536
01:56:06,532 --> 01:56:10,654
[SPEAKER_22]: In that break, you heard a little bit of Summer Vacation there from 2DX6Style.

1537
01:56:11,214 --> 01:56:18,857
[SPEAKER_22]: Charlene from In The Groove, because, you know, a big part of that last segment, we were talking to an In The Groove fan who wanted to discuss with Jamie the pros and cons there.

1538
01:56:19,377 --> 01:56:22,158
[SPEAKER_22]: And they said they liked Charlene, and a lot of our chatroom likes that song, too.

1539
01:56:22,218 --> 01:56:24,999
[SPEAKER_22]: So we thought we'd nod those folks with that.

1540
01:56:26,080 --> 01:56:29,781
[SPEAKER_22]: Also, V, as requested by our chatroom about a gazillion times there.

1541
01:56:29,841 --> 01:56:33,663
[SPEAKER_22]: So there you go, some V. The perennially whored Bomani song.

1542
01:56:34,864 --> 01:56:34,904
[SPEAKER_22]: D.R.

1543
01:56:34,924 --> 01:56:36,006
[SPEAKER_22]: Max, America Max 2

1544
01:56:48,134 --> 01:56:48,734
[SPEAKER_22]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1545
01:57:16,380 --> 01:57:20,301
[SPEAKER_22]: and of course now three of the four of us sitting in the room right now have been to E3 before.

1546
01:57:20,401 --> 01:57:20,881
[SPEAKER_22]: Sorry, Bugs.

1547
01:57:20,901 --> 01:57:21,842
[SPEAKER_22]: I plan on going this year.

1548
01:57:22,102 --> 01:57:22,822
[SPEAKER_22]: Are you going to go this year?

1549
01:57:23,482 --> 01:57:23,702
[SPEAKER_22]: Rad?

1550
01:57:24,022 --> 01:57:24,703
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, Bug?

1551
01:57:25,043 --> 01:57:25,583
[SPEAKER_22]: Get Bug to mic.

1552
01:57:25,603 --> 01:57:28,104
[SPEAKER_16]: Give me the damn mic.

1553
01:57:28,424 --> 01:57:29,444
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, I do plan on going this year.

1554
01:57:29,504 --> 01:57:30,884
[SPEAKER_16]: My roommate has gone for the past four years.

1555
01:57:31,044 --> 01:57:31,345
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, right on.

1556
01:57:33,542 --> 01:57:34,422
[SPEAKER_16]: and many more.

1557
01:57:49,108 --> 01:57:54,109
[SPEAKER_22]: I went for swag my first year And to give away to friends But going to sell is not cool

1558
01:58:18,208 --> 01:58:21,310
[SPEAKER_06]: But last year it was all like, okay, I can't carry this crap around.

1559
01:58:22,511 --> 01:58:28,995
[SPEAKER_06]: And my goal, my first goal, the first year I went was actually for media kits.

1560
01:58:29,655 --> 01:58:36,340
[SPEAKER_06]: My second year was media kits and getting into media events, which I succeeded in.

1561
01:58:36,880 --> 01:58:45,566
[SPEAKER_22]: Overpopulation, of course, my god, E3 was so crowded this year, it's not even funny, which of course ties back into the food lines, are god awful at E3.

1562
01:58:50,267 --> 01:59:14,963
[SPEAKER_22]: I think next year somebody I had ways around that too somebody would be really smart to open up a hot dog stand out front like 50 of them or not just hot dog stands but permits how about a salad they were chasing off folks with hot dog stands because they didn't have permits for sale that is such BS actually it's law well I understand it's the law but come on you've got all those people packed in that tiny building and they're trying to eat for God's sake and to make them pay $10 for a hamburger is insane

1563
01:59:15,743 --> 01:59:17,004
[SPEAKER_22]: So, shame on them.

1564
01:59:18,284 --> 01:59:20,525
[SPEAKER_22]: Or at least somebody go get a permit then and make it legal.

1565
01:59:21,326 --> 01:59:25,588
[SPEAKER_22]: How about instead of like hot dog carts, how about a salad cart or something healthy for these people?

1566
01:59:26,368 --> 01:59:27,089
[SPEAKER_22]: Which includes me.

1567
01:59:27,189 --> 01:59:27,849
[SPEAKER_22]: The fruit cart.

1568
01:59:28,009 --> 01:59:28,569
[SPEAKER_22]: The fruit cart.

1569
01:59:28,589 --> 01:59:29,430
[SPEAKER_22]: How about some hot fruit?

1570
01:59:32,344 --> 01:59:35,166
[SPEAKER_22]: I can't be the only hot fruit at E3, come on.

1571
01:59:36,146 --> 01:59:37,347
[SPEAKER_22]: Media, media, media.

1572
01:59:37,667 --> 01:59:41,229
[SPEAKER_22]: Everything is all media-centric, which some argue is the way it needs to be.

1573
01:59:41,369 --> 01:59:46,052
[SPEAKER_22]: Of course, the Rockstar booth this year was shit unless you were in the media.

1574
01:59:46,733 --> 01:59:49,254
[SPEAKER_22]: You couldn't do anything at that booth unless you were media-oriented.

1575
01:59:49,514 --> 01:59:52,416
[SPEAKER_22]: Some people say that one day of E3 needs to be nothing but media.

1576
01:59:53,537 --> 01:59:55,938
[SPEAKER_22]: Be very interesting, nonetheless.

1577
01:59:56,638 --> 01:59:58,219
[SPEAKER_22]: Sexploitation of E3.

1578
01:59:59,500 --> 02:00:04,444
[SPEAKER_22]: The fact that it's booth babes, booth babes, booth babes, and then just random girls walking around.

1579
02:00:04,464 --> 02:00:05,745
[SPEAKER_22]: Look at this place.

1580
02:00:05,945 --> 02:00:06,165
[SPEAKER_22]: Nope.

1581
02:00:06,386 --> 02:00:07,787
[SPEAKER_22]: Very, very few booth boys.

1582
02:00:07,827 --> 02:00:08,287
[SPEAKER_22]: There's one.

1583
02:00:08,948 --> 02:00:09,428
[SPEAKER_22]: Very few.

1584
02:00:09,508 --> 02:00:10,789
[SPEAKER_22]: Just at the Barbarians.

1585
02:00:10,829 --> 02:00:11,410
[SPEAKER_22]: It was great.

1586
02:00:12,010 --> 02:00:13,111
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, let's face it, though.

1587
02:00:13,251 --> 02:00:17,895
[SPEAKER_22]: The statistics are that, you know, most of the E3... The Bacon Dogs were awesome.

1588
02:00:18,616 --> 02:00:20,397
[SPEAKER_22]: Most of the... That was a random comment.

1589
02:00:20,937 --> 02:00:24,540
[SPEAKER_22]: Most of the E3 is very male-dominated.

1590
02:00:24,560 --> 02:00:26,942
[SPEAKER_22]: But at the same time, I see a lot, a lot more women.

1591
02:00:26,962 --> 02:00:28,844
[SPEAKER_22]: There's more women that go to that show than you'd think.

1592
02:00:30,097 --> 02:00:34,642
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, so I'm kind of surprised they don't have more booth dudes, or whatever you want to call them, booth hunks.

1593
02:00:34,822 --> 02:00:36,223
[SPEAKER_06]: I got interviewed by IGN.

1594
02:00:36,764 --> 02:00:36,984
[SPEAKER_22]: What?

1595
02:00:37,104 --> 02:00:38,385
[SPEAKER_22]: I got interviewed by IGN.

1596
02:00:39,046 --> 02:00:40,087
[SPEAKER_22]: As like a gamer girl, right?

1597
02:00:40,107 --> 02:00:40,928
[SPEAKER_22]: As a gamer girl.

1598
02:00:40,968 --> 02:00:41,148
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

1599
02:00:41,168 --> 02:00:46,253
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, do you consider yourself a gamer girl?

1600
02:00:46,774 --> 02:00:49,657
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I only host internet radio about video games.

1601
02:00:52,045 --> 02:00:53,767
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm sorry, you're not a true gaming girl.

1602
02:00:53,787 --> 02:00:57,691
[SPEAKER_22]: You have not licked a PSP.

1603
02:00:57,711 --> 02:01:01,316
[SPEAKER_06]: I am older school than old school.

1604
02:01:03,418 --> 02:01:06,742
[SPEAKER_22]: People that camp and play the demos all day long.

1605
02:01:08,479 --> 02:01:12,322
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, I realize this, but I'm talking about the one particular demo.

1606
02:01:13,143 --> 02:01:19,067
[SPEAKER_22]: What's a game that people were doing this on at this year's E3 that people would just not get off those damn demos no matter what?

1607
02:01:19,688 --> 02:01:21,269
[SPEAKER_22]: Not really so much Katamari, actually.

1608
02:01:21,649 --> 02:01:24,552
[SPEAKER_22]: The way the Katamari demo was set up, it was very hard to camp that demo.

1609
02:01:25,212 --> 02:01:27,914
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm trying to think of a demo that was really badly camped.

1610
02:01:28,315 --> 02:01:30,797
[SPEAKER_22]: Soul Calibur III was pretty bad.

1611
02:01:31,977 --> 02:01:32,558
[SPEAKER_22]: So, I don't know.

1612
02:01:32,578 --> 02:01:33,659
[SPEAKER_22]: There's other ones, too.

1613
02:01:34,082 --> 02:01:44,025
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, in the year before that, I would say probably Contra, the Contra game, and... Oh, I don't even remember the other one now.

1614
02:01:46,666 --> 02:01:52,568
[SPEAKER_16]: Cattle Pods and Timed Electrical Pulses will... Although some people might get to like that.

1615
02:01:53,008 --> 02:01:57,130
[SPEAKER_22]: Shuttle Delays, so it makes it very hard to get to the damn show, I agree with that one.

1616
02:01:57,930 --> 02:01:58,030
[SPEAKER_22]: Um...

1617
02:01:59,366 --> 02:02:02,868
[SPEAKER_22]: The sound, the fact that the sound is very, very loud there.

1618
02:02:04,109 --> 02:02:05,890
[SPEAKER_22]: Have you ever been to any other type of conference?

1619
02:02:05,910 --> 02:02:07,971
[SPEAKER_06]: I got to touch the Katamari and that made me happy.

1620
02:02:08,672 --> 02:02:15,476
[SPEAKER_22]: The fact that the lines are incredibly long and you never really necessarily know what they're for in some cases.

1621
02:02:17,777 --> 02:02:20,939
[SPEAKER_22]: And sometimes the lines are to just walk through a room.

1622
02:02:21,479 --> 02:02:25,762
[SPEAKER_22]: The article says, The line at Nintendo is for a screening at Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess.

1623
02:02:26,102 --> 02:02:28,784
[SPEAKER_22]: They'd just shown the trailer at the press conference the day before.

1624
02:02:30,148 --> 02:02:41,013
[SPEAKER_22]: and then the line at Sony was to walk through a room where they had hallow models of the PlayStation 3 design behind glass two days before they'd released high-res images of the system anyway.

1625
02:02:41,113 --> 02:02:42,534
[SPEAKER_22]: Were you supposed to kneel down in reverence?

1626
02:02:43,394 --> 02:02:48,476
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, I'm not going to say anything because we had those pictures up as soon as we were back.

1627
02:02:50,297 --> 02:02:57,580
[SPEAKER_22]: Here's their suggestions, and then we'll wrap this up and get into other segments here because I know maybe some people are like, well, what the hell do I care?

1628
02:02:57,620 --> 02:02:58,301
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't get to go to E3.

1629
02:02:58,321 --> 02:02:58,381
[SPEAKER_22]: Huh?

1630
02:02:59,944 --> 02:03:02,005
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, we'll get to that.

1631
02:03:03,366 --> 02:03:04,947
[SPEAKER_22]: Suggestions on how to make E3 better.

1632
02:03:05,267 --> 02:03:06,988
[SPEAKER_22]: Tighten the entrance requirements.

1633
02:03:09,389 --> 02:03:13,491
[SPEAKER_22]: It's saying if you work at a Hollywood video store, you shouldn't be coming in.

1634
02:03:13,591 --> 02:03:16,492
[SPEAKER_22]: If you draw an online comic strip, you shouldn't be coming in.

1635
02:03:16,552 --> 02:03:22,035
[SPEAKER_22]: If you're from blogger.com and you occasionally talk about games, you shouldn't be coming in.

1636
02:03:23,573 --> 02:03:32,781
[SPEAKER_22]: If you just really want to get into E3 because you want to play upcoming games, you're part of the problem, says this site, article.gaminghorizon.com.

1637
02:03:33,081 --> 02:03:34,922
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm not sure if that's the best way to phrase it.

1638
02:03:35,903 --> 02:03:41,508
[SPEAKER_22]: If you work at Target in the garden department, just because Target carries games, you shouldn't be going to E3.

1639
02:03:41,548 --> 02:03:48,233
[SPEAKER_22]: I think you have to play the upcoming games so you can tell other people about them, so yes, that is part of the reason why you play, but anyway.

1640
02:03:49,695 --> 02:03:50,976
[SPEAKER_22]: A Media Only Day...

1641
02:03:51,792 --> 02:03:52,833
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know if that's the answer.

1642
02:03:53,053 --> 02:03:55,014
[SPEAKER_22]: I think the media gets too much favoritism as it is.

1643
02:03:55,134 --> 02:03:57,635
[SPEAKER_22]: If they would just tighten up who they let in in general.

1644
02:03:57,835 --> 02:04:02,718
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but the media, the hype that the media generates is part of what sells the games.

1645
02:04:03,078 --> 02:04:11,483
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand that, but I just... Part of what... True, you've got to cater to the fan base, but it is a media event.

1646
02:04:11,743 --> 02:04:12,923
[SPEAKER_06]: It is an industry event.

1647
02:04:12,983 --> 02:04:14,444
[SPEAKER_22]: It's an industry event, not a media event.

1648
02:04:14,464 --> 02:04:15,024
[SPEAKER_22]: There's a difference.

1649
02:04:15,385 --> 02:04:16,145
[SPEAKER_22]: It's an industry event.

1650
02:04:16,165 --> 02:04:17,746
[SPEAKER_06]: But I do think the media should get a difference.

1651
02:04:18,851 --> 02:04:20,632
[SPEAKER_06]: They're the ones who are actually reporting on it.

1652
02:04:20,692 --> 02:04:24,294
[SPEAKER_06]: They should be getting the information before the average consumer.

1653
02:04:24,634 --> 02:04:26,735
[SPEAKER_22]: What about like a manager of a GameStop who's not the media?

1654
02:04:27,895 --> 02:04:29,356
[SPEAKER_06]: Then they need to be shown some credentials.

1655
02:04:29,416 --> 02:04:30,957
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that they should get into that too.

1656
02:04:31,357 --> 02:04:40,781
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm saying the average GameStop employee, the average Target employee, the people who do a webcomic.

1657
02:04:41,342 --> 02:04:46,464
[SPEAKER_06]: I think if you report on it or if you are in charge of a group that is selling it,

1658
02:04:48,015 --> 02:04:50,097
[SPEAKER_06]: Less babes, more games Streamline the press conferences

1659
02:05:07,197 --> 02:05:17,544
[SPEAKER_22]: The one thing about the press they were saying is no love for the small press like us because G4 and IGN bring like 5,000 people to those things.

1660
02:05:17,684 --> 02:05:18,925
[SPEAKER_22]: They whore out everything.

1661
02:05:19,165 --> 02:05:29,452
[SPEAKER_22]: It's like Joe Bob who actually has a website that's pretty popular but not as popular as these can't get into anything because they're being whored out.

1662
02:05:29,632 --> 02:05:30,473
[SPEAKER_22]: It's like, who are you?

1663
02:05:30,793 --> 02:05:33,155
[SPEAKER_22]: We don't know who you are so fuck off, you know.

1664
02:05:34,336 --> 02:05:37,798
[SPEAKER_22]: and no behind closed doors only content.

1665
02:05:38,178 --> 02:05:39,078
[SPEAKER_22]: I have to agree with that one.

1666
02:05:39,098 --> 02:05:39,338
[SPEAKER_22]: I agree.

1667
02:05:39,358 --> 02:05:42,400
[SPEAKER_22]: That's a bunch of crap, keeping the stuff behind closed doors.

1668
02:05:42,440 --> 02:05:46,941
[SPEAKER_22]: Just don't show it at all.

1669
02:05:47,562 --> 02:05:49,262
[SPEAKER_22]: Fix the demo camper problem.

1670
02:05:50,003 --> 02:05:53,944
[SPEAKER_22]: I'd just have those demos reset after like three minutes or say, time's up, get off my game.

1671
02:05:55,265 --> 02:05:56,305
[SPEAKER_22]: Watch the volume.

1672
02:05:57,066 --> 02:05:59,607
[SPEAKER_22]: Figure out what's secret and what's public.

1673
02:06:00,529 --> 02:06:03,951
[SPEAKER_22]: have operational press sites running alongside the show.

1674
02:06:04,251 --> 02:06:04,952
[SPEAKER_22]: That's kind of interesting.

1675
02:06:05,472 --> 02:06:08,834
[SPEAKER_22]: And the last one, which I think is very interesting, have an East Coast show.

1676
02:06:10,675 --> 02:06:10,835
[SPEAKER_22]: No.

1677
02:06:11,896 --> 02:06:17,799
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, I thought that Microsoft did their Xbox 360 demo very intelligently.

1678
02:06:18,059 --> 02:06:18,760
[SPEAKER_06]: They had a ticket.

1679
02:06:19,921 --> 02:06:23,182
[SPEAKER_06]: You go up, get your ticket, you come back at the time for the ticket, and they let you in.

1680
02:06:23,222 --> 02:06:24,103
[SPEAKER_22]: That's a Squeenix thing.

1681
02:06:25,024 --> 02:06:27,005
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that was pretty smart, too.

1682
02:06:27,245 --> 02:06:28,125
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I think it was very...

1683
02:06:29,306 --> 02:06:34,807
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, although you do have to wait for your turn, but it prevents them from being the insane line.

1684
02:06:35,107 --> 02:06:40,769
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, it did actually prevent the line at Squinnix, but it did prevent the lines for the 360.

1685
02:06:42,129 --> 02:06:45,069
[SPEAKER_06]: You had your line formed at the time it was to let them in.

1686
02:06:45,490 --> 02:06:47,370
[SPEAKER_06]: You get inside, no more line.

1687
02:06:47,390 --> 02:06:49,250
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't have to worry about the congestion of people.

1688
02:06:49,370 --> 02:06:50,251
[SPEAKER_06]: It was very smart.

1689
02:06:51,051 --> 02:06:56,072
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I even think that they should have, this is like what they do with Anime Expo.

1690
02:06:56,872 --> 02:07:07,894
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, if you're staying in the convention center hotels or the ones associated with the convention, then as part of, you know, you can go pick up a ticket when you prove that you're staying at one of these places.

1691
02:07:08,514 --> 02:07:15,116
[SPEAKER_06]: Or, you know, because that will, you know, generate a little bit more money for both the hotel and, you know, and for the convention itself.

1692
02:07:15,956 --> 02:07:25,098
[SPEAKER_06]: But it also prevents, you know, there from being huge congested amounts of people if you have your ticket sales done in a more out of the way location.

1693
02:07:26,709 --> 02:07:29,910
[SPEAKER_22]: A lot of our chat room is really big on the East Coast idea.

1694
02:07:30,090 --> 02:07:40,112
[SPEAKER_22]: I think because of E3 getting overcrowded and over-bloated in a way, I think some of these East Coast shows are starting to pick up the slack a little bit, just naturally.

1695
02:07:40,312 --> 02:07:45,693
[SPEAKER_22]: People are calling this digital live show that's coming up the East Coast E3, and that's just kind of a natural evolution.

1696
02:07:45,773 --> 02:07:52,215
[SPEAKER_16]: There are very few, as far as I can know, there aren't as many game companies out on the East Coast as there are on the West Coast.

1697
02:07:53,035 --> 02:07:53,515
[SPEAKER_22]: That's very true.

1698
02:07:54,151 --> 02:07:58,935
[SPEAKER_16]: and it's significantly easier for, you know, basically L.A.

1699
02:07:58,975 --> 02:08:02,839
[SPEAKER_16]: is a local show for everyone in... But most of them are in the bay.

1700
02:08:02,919 --> 02:08:04,320
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, I guess maybe not.

1701
02:08:04,400 --> 02:08:05,821
[SPEAKER_16]: It's still only four hours.

1702
02:08:05,861 --> 02:08:08,944
[SPEAKER_16]: That's better than four days of having to transport stuff.

1703
02:08:09,004 --> 02:08:12,207
[SPEAKER_16]: Four hours, you know, you can go home for a day, you know, if you fly.

1704
02:08:12,787 --> 02:08:15,329
[SPEAKER_16]: You can go down and up every morning if you have to.

1705
02:08:17,111 --> 02:08:18,852
[SPEAKER_22]: All right, we're going to move on real quick.

1706
02:08:20,052 --> 02:08:20,433
[SPEAKER_22]: DarkSakura

1707
02:08:47,148 --> 02:08:47,468
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1708
02:08:48,409 --> 02:08:50,591
[SPEAKER_22]: More food vendors is my thing.

1709
02:08:50,631 --> 02:08:51,231
[SPEAKER_22]: More food vendors.

1710
02:08:51,271 --> 02:08:55,514
[SPEAKER_22]: That is stupid that I'm losing an hour and a half of playing game time because I'm standing in line for food.

1711
02:08:55,575 --> 02:08:56,155
[SPEAKER_22]: That's awful.

1712
02:08:56,455 --> 02:08:59,317
[SPEAKER_06]: I seriously need to stop being run into by famous people.

1713
02:09:00,678 --> 02:09:01,839
[SPEAKER_16]: And closed door stuff should not.

1714
02:09:02,500 --> 02:09:02,620
[SPEAKER_16]: No.

1715
02:09:02,760 --> 02:09:03,901
[SPEAKER_16]: That's not the reason you're there.

1716
02:09:03,961 --> 02:09:05,902
[SPEAKER_16]: You're there to show stuff, not show stuff.

1717
02:09:06,623 --> 02:09:10,546
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's just to build the excitement about it by making it some secret deal.

1718
02:09:10,706 --> 02:09:12,988
[SPEAKER_22]: The biggest problem with E3 is they let Sinbad in.

1719
02:09:13,786 --> 02:09:14,448
[SPEAKER_22]: and Gary Coleman.

1720
02:09:14,508 --> 02:09:17,757
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, John Cena was there last year and he's pretty hot.

1721
02:09:18,679 --> 02:09:22,008
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright kids, we're going to get into the Orange Lounge Radio cage match or we're going to run out of time.

1722
02:09:23,697 --> 02:09:26,538
[SPEAKER_22]: The way the cage match works is that we play three songs for you guys.

1723
02:09:26,578 --> 02:09:31,720
[SPEAKER_22]: We play a clip of the song that won last week and then two new songs, each host, of course, bringing one song to the table.

1724
02:09:32,160 --> 02:09:33,400
[SPEAKER_22]: You guys vote on your favorite.

1725
02:09:33,440 --> 02:09:40,963
[SPEAKER_22]: The winning song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's Bomani and video game music program, which plays 24 hours a day, seven days a week on the station.

1726
02:09:41,043 --> 02:09:42,203
[SPEAKER_22]: We are not live.

1727
02:09:42,663 --> 02:09:47,205
[SPEAKER_22]: Starting it off tonight is last week's winner, now going for its third win, I believe, if I'm not mistaking.

1728
02:09:48,165 --> 02:09:49,806
[SPEAKER_22]: It's something Loki picked a while back.

1729
02:09:49,906 --> 02:09:52,867
[SPEAKER_22]: It's a remix of V by Doresia.

1730
02:09:53,547 --> 02:09:54,207
[SPEAKER_22]: is the artist.

1731
02:09:54,588 --> 02:09:56,128
[SPEAKER_22]: So it's won for the past two weeks.

1732
02:09:56,188 --> 02:09:57,229
[SPEAKER_22]: Will it win again tonight?

1733
02:09:57,729 --> 02:09:58,930
[SPEAKER_22]: I just don't know.

1734
02:09:58,990 --> 02:09:59,770
[SPEAKER_22]: We'll find out.

1735
02:10:00,490 --> 02:10:03,632
[SPEAKER_22]: Here it is, song number one tonight, a clip of last week's winner, V.

1736
02:11:43,308 --> 02:11:48,891
[SPEAKER_22]: I turned the mics back on right as you yawned, which was... I didn't have... I was... I was asleep.

1737
02:11:48,951 --> 02:11:51,272
[SPEAKER_22]: You're cutting out... I don't know what the hell's wrong with the cord there.

1738
02:11:51,312 --> 02:11:51,652
[SPEAKER_06]: Yo!

1739
02:11:51,772 --> 02:11:52,132
[SPEAKER_22]: There you are.

1740
02:11:52,432 --> 02:11:52,672
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright.

1741
02:11:53,373 --> 02:11:55,834
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just... I was just being lulled to sleep.

1742
02:11:56,054 --> 02:11:59,535
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright, that was song one, Doresio with V. Will it win for the third week in a row?

1743
02:11:59,555 --> 02:12:00,116
[SPEAKER_22]: We'll find out.

1744
02:12:00,176 --> 02:12:02,757
[SPEAKER_22]: Two new songs doing... challenging it tonight.

1745
02:12:03,357 --> 02:12:09,440
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, the first one is my pick, and, um... I haven't won the cage match in, like, three months.

1746
02:12:10,519 --> 02:12:10,999
[SPEAKER_22]: Seriously.

1747
02:12:12,420 --> 02:12:13,721
[SPEAKER_22]: I have not won the cage match in three months.

1748
02:12:14,021 --> 02:12:16,282
[SPEAKER_22]: So I decided tonight I just wasn't going to pick a song.

1749
02:12:16,642 --> 02:12:18,423
[SPEAKER_22]: So I let somebody else pick a song for me.

1750
02:12:19,924 --> 02:12:24,646
[SPEAKER_22]: And Miklatov's been begging and begging me for like two months or something to let him put a song in.

1751
02:12:24,686 --> 02:12:25,446
[SPEAKER_22]: So here you go.

1752
02:12:25,846 --> 02:12:29,828
[SPEAKER_22]: And I swear to God, Miklatov, if this song loses, you never get another one in here.

1753
02:12:29,868 --> 02:12:30,508
[SPEAKER_22]: No, I'm just kidding.

1754
02:12:31,189 --> 02:12:31,789
[SPEAKER_22]: But here it is.

1755
02:12:32,770 --> 02:12:35,011
[SPEAKER_22]: This is a song by a group called Pendulum.

1756
02:12:35,631 --> 02:12:37,412
[SPEAKER_22]: And the song is called Hold Your Color.

1757
02:12:38,172 --> 02:12:39,473
[SPEAKER_22]: So we'll see what you guys think.

1758
02:12:39,533 --> 02:12:40,494
[SPEAKER_22]: Here it is, song number two.

1759
02:12:42,515 --> 02:12:46,919
So can't forget So can't forget So can't forget So can't forget

1760
02:13:08,237 --> 02:13:09,098
Thanks for watching!

1761
02:13:09,118 --> 02:13:10,279
Subscribe for more!

1762
02:16:03,579 --> 02:16:04,600
Thanks for watching!

1763
02:18:09,104 --> 02:18:12,006
[SPEAKER_22]: Song number two in tonight's cage match, Pendulum, Hold Your Color.

1764
02:18:13,087 --> 02:18:14,789
[SPEAKER_22]: We're not going to hold back our thoughts any longer.

1765
02:18:14,829 --> 02:18:16,270
[SPEAKER_22]: What do you guys think of that, DarkSakura?

1766
02:18:17,769 --> 02:18:20,391
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I like it a lot.

1767
02:18:21,152 --> 02:18:26,575
[SPEAKER_06]: I just felt it was a little long and got a little repetitive, but I really do like the song a lot, so it gets an 8.5.

1768
02:18:27,296 --> 02:18:27,636
[SPEAKER_22]: Loki.

1769
02:18:27,936 --> 02:18:33,400
[SPEAKER_20]: I like the beginning of it, then it just kind of, I don't know, it dropped off in my interest, I guess.

1770
02:18:34,281 --> 02:18:34,781
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, so 9.

1771
02:18:36,262 --> 02:18:36,682
[SPEAKER_22]: Bugged.

1772
02:18:38,463 --> 02:18:39,204
[SPEAKER_22]: Good driving song.

1773
02:18:40,385 --> 02:18:40,605
[SPEAKER_16]: About an 8.

1774
02:18:41,970 --> 02:18:42,991
[SPEAKER_22]: DarkSakura, which pick first tonight?

1775
02:19:07,515 --> 02:19:10,136
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, it's, uh, off the new Enflo album.

1776
02:19:11,296 --> 02:19:13,857
[SPEAKER_06]: It's, uh, Enflo Loves Benny K's Taste Your Stuff.

1777
02:19:15,277 --> 02:19:16,417
[SPEAKER_22]: Some Enflo tonight.

1778
02:19:16,437 --> 02:19:17,437
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep, new Enflo.

1779
02:19:17,537 --> 02:19:18,538
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright, new Enflo.

1780
02:19:19,418 --> 02:19:20,398
[SPEAKER_22]: Song number three tonight.

1781
02:19:20,958 --> 02:19:24,819
[SPEAKER_22]: DarkSakura's pick, Enflo Loves Benny K with Taste Your Stuff.

1782
02:19:35,515 --> 02:19:42,660
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, nobody else Hey, nobody else

1783
02:20:43,905 --> 02:20:44,747
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for watching!

1784
02:21:55,467 --> 02:21:56,268
[SPEAKER_08]: Akihito, Akihito

1785
02:22:22,766 --> 02:22:24,127
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for watching!

1786
02:23:14,256 --> 02:23:32,283
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, that was song number three in tonight's cage match.

1787
02:23:32,503 --> 02:23:35,824
[SPEAKER_22]: Mflow loves Benny K with Taste Your Stuff.

1788
02:23:36,304 --> 02:23:37,845
[SPEAKER_22]: Very interesting name for a song there.

1789
02:23:38,868 --> 02:23:41,730
[SPEAKER_22]: So let's see, uh, did that leave a good taste or a bad taste in your mouth?

1790
02:23:41,770 --> 02:23:42,431
[SPEAKER_22]: DarkSakura?

1791
02:23:42,691 --> 02:23:44,052
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm broken, do no wrong, 10.

1792
02:23:44,872 --> 02:23:45,232
[SPEAKER_22]: Loki?

1793
02:23:45,433 --> 02:23:46,854
[SPEAKER_22]: Were they talking about snowballing?

1794
02:23:47,494 --> 02:23:48,114
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't think so.

1795
02:23:48,535 --> 02:23:51,017
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, um, I think it's an 8.

1796
02:23:51,497 --> 02:23:53,578
[SPEAKER_22]: I was, they lost me at the meowing.

1797
02:23:54,699 --> 02:23:54,999
[SPEAKER_22]: Bugged.

1798
02:23:56,320 --> 02:23:57,041
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, same thing.

1799
02:23:57,761 --> 02:23:58,141
[SPEAKER_16]: Yelling.

1800
02:23:58,242 --> 02:23:58,642
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright.

1801
02:23:59,422 --> 02:24:00,603
[SPEAKER_22]: I liked it, it was kind of cool.

1802
02:24:01,563 --> 02:24:06,106
[SPEAKER_22]: It's weird because whenever I decide to randomly download and upload, I get a really shitty song.

1803
02:24:06,406 --> 02:24:10,989
[SPEAKER_22]: Whenever she picks one for Cage Match, it's actually really good and I like them, so go figure.

1804
02:24:11,389 --> 02:24:13,190
[SPEAKER_22]: So I like that song, it was cool.

1805
02:24:13,250 --> 02:24:15,571
[SPEAKER_22]: It had like a porno beat to it, which was kind of cool.

1806
02:24:15,912 --> 02:24:19,614
[SPEAKER_22]: So I give it like an 8.5, maybe 9.

1807
02:24:20,554 --> 02:24:21,775
[SPEAKER_22]: I could be talked into a 9.

1808
02:24:21,815 --> 02:24:22,375
[SPEAKER_22]: 8.5 though for now.

1809
02:24:24,079 --> 02:24:26,780
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright, let's recap the three songs you can vote for tonight.

1810
02:24:27,241 --> 02:24:42,109
[SPEAKER_22]: Starting off with song number one is Doresia with The... And song number two you can vote for tonight is Pendulum with Hold Your Color.

1811
02:24:50,749 --> 02:24:55,653
[SPEAKER_22]: And song number three you can vote for tonight is Mflow Loves Benny K with Taste Your Stuff.

1812
02:24:55,673 --> 02:24:58,556
[SPEAKER_22]: Whoa, that's not it.

1813
02:24:59,337 --> 02:24:59,817
[SPEAKER_22]: How about this?

1814
02:25:00,177 --> 02:25:01,078
[SPEAKER_22]: Let's try this again.

1815
02:25:01,218 --> 02:25:02,980
[SPEAKER_22]: Mflow Loves Benny K with Taste Your Stuff.

1816
02:25:11,637 --> 02:25:13,317
[SPEAKER_22]: All right, kids, you know what to do.

1817
02:25:13,738 --> 02:25:16,158
[SPEAKER_22]: Place vote now.

1818
02:25:16,258 --> 02:25:19,999
[SPEAKER_22]: Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.

1819
02:25:20,379 --> 02:25:31,661
[SPEAKER_22]: Remember, screaming and hollering in the chat room will not count as a vote, although, you know, you may sway some other people, but I'm not encouraging you people to start flooding the chat room.

1820
02:25:31,881 --> 02:25:33,601
[SPEAKER_22]: No flooding.

1821
02:25:34,421 --> 02:25:38,962
[SPEAKER_22]: You have to allow them to campaign for a song they might want, but, you know, no flooding.

1822
02:25:39,673 --> 02:25:41,115
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, the next person who floods me.

1823
02:25:41,155 --> 02:25:42,036
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, don't flood.

1824
02:25:42,737 --> 02:25:43,758
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright, so there you go.

1825
02:25:43,798 --> 02:25:46,020
[SPEAKER_22]: Have fun arguing about that.

1826
02:25:46,561 --> 02:25:51,267
[SPEAKER_22]: In the meantime, Loki, I'm really curious to hear what's going on in the sim scene.

1827
02:25:51,287 --> 02:25:52,508
[SPEAKER_22]: Setmania 3.9, release candidate 4.

1828
02:25:52,548 --> 02:25:52,808
[SPEAKER_22]: That's it.

1829
02:25:55,987 --> 02:25:56,387
[SPEAKER_22]: That's it?

1830
02:25:56,567 --> 02:25:56,887
[SPEAKER_20]: That's it.

1831
02:25:57,128 --> 02:25:59,088
[SPEAKER_22]: God damn the Sims team for being slow lately.

1832
02:25:59,109 --> 02:26:00,569
[SPEAKER_22]: They really haven't been doing anything lately.

1833
02:26:01,190 --> 02:26:01,990
[SPEAKER_20]: Get up off your asses, people.

1834
02:26:02,010 --> 02:26:03,270
[SPEAKER_20]: Everybody's on vacation.

1835
02:26:03,731 --> 02:26:04,931
[SPEAKER_22]: They're getting... Vacation?

1836
02:26:05,011 --> 02:26:06,372
[SPEAKER_22]: It's early October.

1837
02:26:06,692 --> 02:26:07,152
[SPEAKER_22]: What are they doing?

1838
02:26:07,192 --> 02:26:08,633
[SPEAKER_22]: Going on vacation for Columbus Day?

1839
02:26:08,673 --> 02:26:09,894
[SPEAKER_22]: How do I go on vacation?

1840
02:26:10,634 --> 02:26:11,074
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know.

1841
02:26:12,515 --> 02:26:21,519
[SPEAKER_22]: All I know is that that release candidate's coming out, and they're promising Set Mania 4 someday, and I think I lost interest, like, what, three years ago when they were on release candidate 3?

1842
02:26:21,559 --> 02:26:21,779
[SPEAKER_22]: So, um...

1843
02:26:23,877 --> 02:26:50,184
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, anyways, um, no, nothing really going on, um, was it, OSC 4, um, the other step file, uh, contest they are in judging right now, and, yeah, and, um, I don't know, oh, I know, um, I was gonna see if, um, the, was it, uh,

1844
02:26:51,854 --> 02:26:52,735
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you for watching!

1845
02:27:09,119 --> 02:27:13,360
[SPEAKER_22]: It's down to the final 10, well, 11 actually.

1846
02:27:13,660 --> 02:27:15,781
[SPEAKER_22]: How many remixes of 2DX songs are in there?

1847
02:27:16,721 --> 02:27:20,222
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, here's the finalists in no particular order.

1848
02:27:20,562 --> 02:27:21,702
[SPEAKER_22]: Curious what songs people choose.

1849
02:27:21,722 --> 02:27:28,164
[SPEAKER_22]: Din Dan Don, Speed Mix, Lucky Cha Cha Cha, Heaven is a Place on Earth, the Speedo Mix.

1850
02:27:28,424 --> 02:27:30,344
[SPEAKER_22]: Isn't Ding Dang Dong a Smile Decay song?

1851
02:27:30,504 --> 02:27:30,824
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know.

1852
02:27:30,864 --> 02:27:31,925
[SPEAKER_06]: That last one is Wild Side.

1853
02:27:33,325 --> 02:27:37,906
[SPEAKER_22]: Canned Heat by Jamiroquai, Unbalance, Country Roads,

1854
02:27:39,293 --> 02:27:46,065
[SPEAKER_22]: Take On Me, Speedo Mix, Bye Bye Bike, Boys and Girls Mix, and Not For Sale.

1855
02:27:50,288 --> 02:27:58,115
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, hooray for you people not- All of which, I might add, they said who made them, so no unbiased judging there.

1856
02:27:59,136 --> 02:28:02,900
[SPEAKER_22]: My hat's off, though, for not picking Bomani songs and making steps for them.

1857
02:28:02,980 --> 02:28:07,064
[SPEAKER_22]: I think you got bumped down if you did something like that or something.

1858
02:28:07,084 --> 02:28:08,585
[SPEAKER_22]: Good, good, because I was sick of seeing those.

1859
02:28:09,666 --> 02:28:12,248
[SPEAKER_22]: Although it sounds like a bunch of Dance Mania speed songs are in there.

1860
02:28:13,550 --> 02:28:14,591
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh well, what can you do?

1861
02:28:17,135 --> 02:28:19,998
[SPEAKER_22]: And of course I'm getting corrected in the chatroom, it's not a SmileDK song.

1862
02:28:20,038 --> 02:28:21,519
[SPEAKER_22]: Where the hell have I heard that name before?

1863
02:28:22,720 --> 02:28:23,320
[SPEAKER_22]: Ding dang dong.

1864
02:28:23,380 --> 02:28:24,701
[SPEAKER_22]: I know I've heard that song name before.

1865
02:28:25,682 --> 02:28:27,784
[SPEAKER_22]: Like, it's on a Dance Mania CD, I can swear.

1866
02:28:29,266 --> 02:28:30,486
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh well.

1867
02:28:30,646 --> 02:28:31,027
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't care.

1868
02:28:32,067 --> 02:28:32,687
[SPEAKER_22]: Ugly looking.

1869
02:28:33,087 --> 02:28:33,387
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright.

1870
02:28:34,808 --> 02:28:37,709
[SPEAKER_22]: I wanted to play this- I feel like I'm going to a Taika Parade all of a sudden.

1871
02:28:38,429 --> 02:28:39,509
[SPEAKER_22]: I know, he's still at it.

1872
02:28:39,649 --> 02:28:41,250
[SPEAKER_22]: Extaper is still playing Taika.

1873
02:28:41,390 --> 02:28:42,010
[SPEAKER_22]: You know what's funny?

1874
02:28:42,450 --> 02:28:44,591
[SPEAKER_22]: He bought the game at like 5 o'clock today, okay?

1875
02:28:44,951 --> 02:28:51,533
[SPEAKER_22]: He already has told me he's beat the game on easy, which means he's played every song in the game on easy mode now, and now he's going back through on normal mode.

1876
02:28:51,633 --> 02:28:51,853
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

1877
02:28:54,144 --> 02:28:55,865
[SPEAKER_22]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1878
02:29:23,919 --> 02:29:25,920
[SPEAKER_22]: I swear to god she says fuck me

1879
02:29:51,653 --> 02:29:55,954
[SPEAKER_22]: So we're going to listen right now to a little bit of acapella here, Sana, Injection of Love.

1880
02:29:56,914 --> 02:30:15,257
[SPEAKER_13]: So you can actually kind of hear the little thuds there in the background, so let's see if we can get into the... You can hear little bits of the music in there because the cancellation is not perfect.

1881
02:30:20,902 --> 02:30:22,963
[SPEAKER_22]: It sounds like playing a record backwards, doesn't it?

1882
02:30:24,403 --> 02:30:38,327
[SPEAKER_13]: Here it is.

1883
02:30:38,907 --> 02:30:43,548
[SPEAKER_22]: When you hear it like that, it doesn't sound like fuck so much, but it definitely sounds like froak me.

1884
02:30:45,615 --> 02:30:46,996
[SPEAKER_06]: Gently stroke me.

1885
02:30:47,336 --> 02:30:47,456
[SPEAKER_06]: Me.

1886
02:30:47,476 --> 02:30:47,556
[SPEAKER_06]: Me.

1887
02:30:47,596 --> 02:30:47,696
[SPEAKER_06]: Me.

1888
02:30:47,736 --> 02:30:47,776
[SPEAKER_06]: Me.

1889
02:30:47,796 --> 02:30:47,856
[SPEAKER_06]: Me.

1890
02:30:47,876 --> 02:30:47,956
[SPEAKER_22]: Me.

1891
02:30:47,996 --> 02:30:48,056
[SPEAKER_22]: Me.

1892
02:30:48,076 --> 02:30:48,116
[SPEAKER_22]: Me.

1893
02:30:48,136 --> 02:30:48,176
[SPEAKER_22]: Me.

1894
02:30:48,197 --> 02:30:48,237
[SPEAKER_22]: Me.

1895
02:31:11,826 --> 02:31:12,406
[SPEAKER_06]: Think about this.

1896
02:31:13,467 --> 02:31:26,234
[SPEAKER_06]: If it were written out in Karakana, it would be So try saying really fast and see how it comes out.

1897
02:31:28,475 --> 02:31:29,056
[SPEAKER_22]: Fuck me!

1898
02:31:30,748 --> 02:31:31,488
[SPEAKER_22]: Wow, you're right.

1899
02:31:31,809 --> 02:31:32,129
[SPEAKER_06]: Amazing.

1900
02:31:32,149 --> 02:31:42,554
[SPEAKER_06]: But seriously, if you listen to that part again and listen to it as if the whole STR little cluster there is actually three syllables.

1901
02:31:44,215 --> 02:31:45,776
[SPEAKER_04]: What is there to stroke on her?

1902
02:31:46,957 --> 02:31:47,777
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe her breast.

1903
02:31:49,058 --> 02:31:50,479
[SPEAKER_06]: She wants it gently, whatever.

1904
02:31:52,210 --> 02:31:52,570
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

1905
02:31:53,150 --> 02:31:56,372
[SPEAKER_04]: Froak you, and froak you, and froak you too.

1906
02:31:56,412 --> 02:31:57,512
[SPEAKER_22]: Does she have a penis?

1907
02:31:57,772 --> 02:31:59,933
[SPEAKER_22]: No, I mean, as far as I know, no.

1908
02:32:00,914 --> 02:32:02,775
[SPEAKER_22]: Can you stroke a vagina, Loki?

1909
02:32:02,795 --> 02:32:04,815
[SPEAKER_22]: You could, oh god, please don't.

1910
02:32:04,915 --> 02:32:06,156
[SPEAKER_22]: You can't really do that.

1911
02:32:06,536 --> 02:32:10,078
[SPEAKER_22]: Unless there's some really abnormalities, we're not going to go there.

1912
02:32:10,458 --> 02:32:12,679
[SPEAKER_22]: But, um, yeah.

1913
02:32:13,319 --> 02:32:15,280
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't think so.

1914
02:32:15,954 --> 02:32:21,078
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1915
02:32:21,659 --> 02:32:24,401
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't the Clitoris like just another version of a penis?

1916
02:32:24,421 --> 02:32:25,082
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

1917
02:32:26,183 --> 02:32:26,623
[SPEAKER_04]: Never mind.

1918
02:32:27,884 --> 02:32:29,545
[SPEAKER_22]: I'll just let that thought answer.

1919
02:32:29,685 --> 02:32:30,606
[SPEAKER_22]: This is why you're gay.

1920
02:32:30,726 --> 02:32:32,388
[SPEAKER_22]: Just stay gay.

1921
02:32:33,048 --> 02:32:33,508
[SPEAKER_22]: Stay gay.

1922
02:32:33,749 --> 02:32:37,592
[SPEAKER_22]: Don't try to do things that are outside your... Curiosity is bad.

1923
02:32:37,992 --> 02:32:40,374
[SPEAKER_06]: Curiosity led to the founding of countries.

1924
02:32:40,694 --> 02:32:41,715
[SPEAKER_22]: No, you're not getting the microphone back.

1925
02:32:41,735 --> 02:32:42,596
[SPEAKER_06]: Do they have a flag?

1926
02:32:46,614 --> 02:32:48,876
[SPEAKER_06]: No flag, no country, you can't have one.

1927
02:32:48,896 --> 02:32:51,799
[SPEAKER_22]: Jamie wants to hear it one more time, and then I swear to God we're dropping this subject forever.

1928
02:32:53,300 --> 02:32:54,081
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright, let's see, here we go.

1929
02:32:58,505 --> 02:32:58,805
[SPEAKER_06]: See?

1930
02:33:00,646 --> 02:33:02,268
[SPEAKER_06]: If you listen to it with that in mind.

1931
02:33:02,988 --> 02:33:04,790
[SPEAKER_22]: But then again, you also... Broke off.

1932
02:33:05,190 --> 02:33:09,294
[SPEAKER_22]: Here's what we gotta say also, that's not gonna rip her voice exactly how it was.

1933
02:33:09,814 --> 02:33:11,676
[SPEAKER_22]: It could've ripped off part of the voice.

1934
02:33:11,696 --> 02:33:13,918
[SPEAKER_06]: It didn't rip her voice, it ripped everything else out.

1935
02:33:14,315 --> 02:33:18,998
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, it might not have worked just perfectly, because I know when I try to take vocals out of stuff, sometimes you hear echoes in the background.

1936
02:33:19,118 --> 02:33:19,558
[SPEAKER_22]: You know what?

1937
02:33:19,578 --> 02:33:22,139
[SPEAKER_22]: We could actually run it through our computers and see what happens.

1938
02:33:22,199 --> 02:33:23,220
[SPEAKER_22]: Let's try doing this.

1939
02:33:23,320 --> 02:33:25,081
[SPEAKER_22]: Let me open up the file here.

1940
02:33:26,862 --> 02:33:28,403
[SPEAKER_22]: And then I'm going to make some changes to it.

1941
02:33:30,324 --> 02:33:32,185
[SPEAKER_22]: And just kind of, you know, do the cancellation thing.

1942
02:33:33,565 --> 02:33:34,906
[SPEAKER_22]: And let's see what it sounds like this time.

1943
02:33:34,946 --> 02:33:36,847
[SPEAKER_22]: Let's listen to our version of it.

1944
02:33:38,308 --> 02:33:38,868
[SPEAKER_13]: Touch me.

1945
02:33:44,485 --> 02:33:46,647
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, fuck me!

1946
02:33:49,609 --> 02:33:50,110
[SPEAKER_22]: Amazing.

1947
02:33:50,410 --> 02:33:50,870
[SPEAKER_22]: Amazing.

1948
02:33:52,291 --> 02:33:52,712
[SPEAKER_22]: Amazing.

1949
02:33:52,812 --> 02:33:53,052
[SPEAKER_22]: See?

1950
02:33:53,432 --> 02:33:57,335
[SPEAKER_06]: The original was doctored.

1951
02:33:58,216 --> 02:33:59,517
[SPEAKER_22]: The original was doctored.

1952
02:34:05,441 --> 02:34:06,642
[SPEAKER_22]: I think we should go to a break now.

1953
02:34:07,423 --> 02:34:08,564
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wait, not before we get...

1954
02:34:09,673 --> 02:34:09,873
[SPEAKER_22]: What?

1955
02:34:10,253 --> 02:34:11,134
[SPEAKER_04]: Bleached Katamari.

1956
02:34:12,474 --> 02:34:13,614
[SPEAKER_04]: Bleached Katamari?

1957
02:34:13,634 --> 02:34:16,936
[SPEAKER_22]: Have I been out of the room too long?

1958
02:34:16,996 --> 02:34:18,376
[SPEAKER_22]: You have, you have.

1959
02:34:18,496 --> 02:34:22,958
[SPEAKER_22]: But Extrofer, you're back just in time because I'll be damned if we miss this.

1960
02:34:23,058 --> 02:34:24,459
[SPEAKER_04]: Please don't play the gay music.

1961
02:34:24,899 --> 02:34:25,679
[SPEAKER_22]: You get the gay music.

1962
02:34:25,799 --> 02:34:27,800
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want the gay music.

1963
02:34:29,040 --> 02:34:30,721
[SPEAKER_22]: We need Extrofer's movie reveal.

1964
02:34:32,068 --> 02:34:33,589
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to choose the music for that.

1965
02:34:33,669 --> 02:34:33,830
[SPEAKER_22]: No.

1966
02:34:34,330 --> 02:34:34,930
[SPEAKER_22]: Extover.

1967
02:34:36,031 --> 02:34:36,932
[SPEAKER_04]: What did you see this week?

1968
02:34:37,593 --> 02:34:41,556
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I saw In Her Shoes yesterday.

1969
02:34:41,616 --> 02:34:42,497
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't that a chick flick?

1970
02:34:43,317 --> 02:34:45,019
[SPEAKER_04]: It is not a chick flick.

1971
02:34:45,259 --> 02:34:47,841
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, it's a chick flick for gay guys.

1972
02:34:49,362 --> 02:34:50,243
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no.

1973
02:34:50,263 --> 02:34:51,644
[SPEAKER_04]: Does that make it a dick flick?

1974
02:34:52,325 --> 02:34:53,426
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes it a dick flick.

1975
02:34:53,546 --> 02:34:54,547
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes it a cock flick.

1976
02:34:55,455 --> 02:34:56,475
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like Sex and the City.

1977
02:34:57,195 --> 02:34:57,656
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no.

1978
02:34:58,096 --> 02:35:07,718
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually a movie about two sisters who go through some life-altering changes and how they kind of come together.

1979
02:35:08,019 --> 02:35:18,422
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's a good movie if you're ever in the process of... Unfortunately, sometimes in your life you may lose friends or you may be in the process of losing friends.

1980
02:35:18,922 --> 02:35:23,143
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a good movie to see when you're in that process.

1981
02:35:23,840 --> 02:35:27,501
[SPEAKER_04]: But otherwise, I mean, it's a total conflict.

1982
02:35:31,883 --> 02:35:34,824
[SPEAKER_04]: The female listeners of our show, thank you for that analogy.

1983
02:35:35,624 --> 02:35:36,224
[SPEAKER_04]: No problem.

1984
02:35:36,404 --> 02:35:36,845
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1985
02:35:38,985 --> 02:35:39,946
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw Serenity again.

1986
02:35:40,426 --> 02:35:40,946
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay!

1987
02:35:41,206 --> 02:35:41,946
[SPEAKER_04]: Talk about that.

1988
02:35:42,066 --> 02:35:43,447
[SPEAKER_06]: We have to go see Serenity next week.

1989
02:35:43,727 --> 02:35:45,087
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go see Serenity next week.

1990
02:35:45,107 --> 02:35:45,527
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do it.

1991
02:35:45,768 --> 02:35:46,568
[SPEAKER_04]: After Firefly.

1992
02:35:46,628 --> 02:35:48,028
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody needs to go see Serenity.

1993
02:35:48,048 --> 02:35:49,589
[SPEAKER_06]: Next Friday, we're going to see Serenity again.

1994
02:35:49,609 --> 02:35:50,269
[SPEAKER_04]: I got nine points.

1995
02:35:50,289 --> 02:35:50,709
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, never mind.

1996
02:35:53,779 --> 02:35:55,020
[SPEAKER_06]: We kind of spoiled it for Dan.

1997
02:35:56,421 --> 02:35:59,624
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we spoiled it for Jamie's husband.

1998
02:35:59,724 --> 02:36:01,205
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, don't spoil it for the listeners, please.

1999
02:36:01,565 --> 02:36:03,727
[SPEAKER_22]: But how did you spoil it without spoiling it for the listeners?

2000
02:36:03,827 --> 02:36:06,148
[SPEAKER_04]: We just mentioned, oh, that's so sad.

2001
02:36:06,369 --> 02:36:08,250
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and oh, that's so funny.

2002
02:36:08,670 --> 02:36:10,792
[SPEAKER_04]: And oh, that's so sad how that was so funny.

2003
02:36:11,452 --> 02:36:16,156
[SPEAKER_06]: And oh, that's so... And the people who have seen it will know what I'm talking about.

2004
02:36:16,196 --> 02:36:21,740
[SPEAKER_06]: You have this utter scene of, oh, and even a little bit of laughter, and all of a sudden, bam, dead silence.

2005
02:36:22,259 --> 02:36:42,512
[SPEAKER_22]: I know, it was a crazy time Without being a spoiler I'm being corrected by one of our chatters I'm going through trying to tally the cage match votes The Smile DK song is Ding Ding Dong Not Ding Dang Dong Okay people, do you see how I got confused?

2006
02:36:42,692 --> 02:36:51,157
[SPEAKER_06]: Come on, it was one vowel Here's your Serenity spoiler, by the way Thank you, Goggle, by the way The Reavers all put on tutus and do the hokey pokey in roller skates

2007
02:36:52,745 --> 02:36:53,865
[SPEAKER_04]: and NYP and Bowls.

2008
02:36:55,246 --> 02:36:56,046
[SPEAKER_22]: You guys are weird.

2009
02:36:56,166 --> 02:36:57,626
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you still have your icons on your computer?

2010
02:36:58,807 --> 02:37:04,848
[SPEAKER_22]: No, I deleted all those folders that you placed on my computer last week with the... Which makes me want to put some more on there.

2011
02:37:05,028 --> 02:37:05,628
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think so.

2012
02:37:05,648 --> 02:37:08,929
[SPEAKER_04]: So what are we going to say about Serenity being in 9th place, huh?

2013
02:37:09,549 --> 02:37:10,990
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Serenity was in 9th place.

2014
02:37:11,050 --> 02:37:12,170
[SPEAKER_06]: How much money has it made so far?

2015
02:37:12,630 --> 02:37:14,870
[SPEAKER_04]: About 17 point something million dollars.

2016
02:37:14,910 --> 02:37:16,611
[SPEAKER_06]: Serenity needs to make $80,000 so we get a sequel.

2017
02:37:16,651 --> 02:37:16,611
$80,000? $80,000.

2018
02:37:21,974 --> 02:37:24,376
[SPEAKER_22]: Everyone needs to see Serenity a bajillion times.

2019
02:37:24,416 --> 02:37:27,218
[SPEAKER_22]: So declares me.

2020
02:37:43,220 --> 02:37:49,464
[SPEAKER_04]: To imagine how many times a bajillion is, imagine one time a bajillion times.

2021
02:37:51,205 --> 02:37:52,065
[SPEAKER_04]: That was really poor.

2022
02:38:03,996 --> 02:38:05,798
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright, you guys ready to find out who won tonight's cage match?

2023
02:38:05,818 --> 02:38:07,960
[SPEAKER_22]: Have you ever thought about password protecting your computer?

2024
02:38:08,160 --> 02:38:09,261
[SPEAKER_06]: Girls, that's one!

2025
02:38:09,301 --> 02:38:09,881
[SPEAKER_22]: Why, what?

2026
02:38:10,562 --> 02:38:14,205
[SPEAKER_22]: So... Aw, Jesus, did you just go in and make folders on my desktop?

2027
02:38:14,465 --> 02:38:16,587
[SPEAKER_22]: No, I could, should... No?

2028
02:38:16,847 --> 02:38:19,550
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, even I voted in the cage match today, didn't I, Rob?

2029
02:38:19,590 --> 02:38:19,890
[SPEAKER_22]: Stop it.

2030
02:38:20,050 --> 02:38:20,270
[SPEAKER_22]: What?

2031
02:38:20,611 --> 02:38:21,852
[SPEAKER_06]: Even I voted in the cage match today.

2032
02:38:21,872 --> 02:38:22,532
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, but it didn't count.

2033
02:38:23,033 --> 02:38:25,495
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I voted for Skye as the voice of the game for matching service.

2034
02:38:25,515 --> 02:38:26,236
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright.

2035
02:38:27,133 --> 02:38:29,194
[SPEAKER_22]: Here we go, let's find out tonight's cage match winner, you guys.

2036
02:38:29,654 --> 02:38:32,695
[SPEAKER_22]: More votes than I have ever seen in a cage match, ever.

2037
02:38:33,215 --> 02:38:37,397
[SPEAKER_22]: And no song, I mean, it was very close between all three songs tonight.

2038
02:38:37,577 --> 02:38:38,778
[SPEAKER_22]: So the chat room just loved them all.

2039
02:38:39,358 --> 02:38:40,558
[SPEAKER_22]: But only one could win.

2040
02:38:41,679 --> 02:38:49,022
[SPEAKER_22]: And the winning song in tonight's cage match is... Pendulum with Hold Your Color.

2041
02:38:50,868 --> 02:38:52,548
[SPEAKER_22]: which means I finally fucking won a cage match.

2042
02:38:52,568 --> 02:38:52,889
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

2043
02:38:53,089 --> 02:38:53,829
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, chat room.

2044
02:38:54,029 --> 02:38:56,569
[SPEAKER_22]: And thank you... Thank you for giving Rob the pity vote.

2045
02:38:56,589 --> 02:38:56,810
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

2046
02:38:57,410 --> 02:39:03,811
[SPEAKER_22]: And actually, Miklatov won it, and I didn't even win it, so... Fuck you, Miklatov, for showing me up.

2047
02:39:04,031 --> 02:39:05,312
[SPEAKER_06]: More proof, what have I been telling you?

2048
02:39:05,352 --> 02:39:07,532
[SPEAKER_06]: Pick stuff other than generic trance, and you'll have a winner.

2049
02:39:07,552 --> 02:39:09,393
[SPEAKER_22]: I have been picking stuff other than generic trance.

2050
02:39:10,433 --> 02:39:12,033
[SPEAKER_22]: Pick Britney Spears' Toxic.

2051
02:39:12,154 --> 02:39:12,914
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, God, no.

2052
02:39:13,314 --> 02:39:14,534
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just kidding.

2053
02:39:14,554 --> 02:39:17,495
[SPEAKER_22]: Actually, it's funny, I actually did have a generic trance song, but it was really good.

2054
02:39:18,223 --> 02:39:20,064
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that means that next week I have to play ABBA.

2055
02:39:20,805 --> 02:39:23,866
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, I was actually disappointed that you did not choose ABBA tonight.

2056
02:39:24,707 --> 02:39:29,009
[SPEAKER_06]: I was trying to actually be serious, but I almost put it in a Danger Doom track.

2057
02:39:30,270 --> 02:39:34,333
[SPEAKER_22]: Did you know that the new Madonna song actually samples ABBA?

2058
02:39:35,013 --> 02:39:35,273
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

2059
02:39:35,533 --> 02:39:41,677
[SPEAKER_22]: And I honestly thought I had never heard the gayest song ever made, but I think this could possibly be it.

2060
02:39:41,917 --> 02:39:46,360
[SPEAKER_22]: Fusing Madonna and ABBA together could quite possibly be anal sex in song form.

2061
02:39:46,680 --> 02:39:46,780
[SPEAKER_22]: Hmm.

2062
02:39:48,348 --> 02:39:50,529
[SPEAKER_06]: I've already heard foreplay in song form.

2063
02:39:50,869 --> 02:39:53,911
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyone who's ever seen Phantom of the Opera has.

2064
02:39:54,291 --> 02:39:56,993
[SPEAKER_04]: There should be an ab workout machine called Abba.

2065
02:39:57,273 --> 02:39:57,813
[SPEAKER_04]: The Abba.

2066
02:39:58,834 --> 02:40:02,696
[SPEAKER_04]: Whenever you crunch it, it gives you like... Mama Mia.

2067
02:40:03,076 --> 02:40:05,638
[SPEAKER_22]: Thanks for stopping, stupid.

2068
02:40:06,158 --> 02:40:06,438
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright.

2069
02:40:09,620 --> 02:40:09,960
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright.

2070
02:40:10,801 --> 02:40:11,541
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh my god, it's Rob.

2071
02:40:11,822 --> 02:40:20,367
[SPEAKER_22]: I've heard music in foreplay form before too and it's going to start off this next break and we'll be back with more Orange Lounge Radio and the FUs of the week.

2072
02:40:20,387 --> 02:40:20,988
[SPEAKER_22]: We've got to get to those.

2073
02:40:21,028 --> 02:40:21,748
[SPEAKER_22]: We're running out of time.

2074
02:40:22,068 --> 02:40:24,450
[SPEAKER_22]: So we'll be right back after this break with more Orange Lounge Radio.

2075
02:41:12,661 --> 02:41:13,622
Thanks for watching!

2076
02:41:41,586 --> 02:41:42,447
Thank you for watching!

2077
02:45:07,455 --> 02:45:23,943
Came in from the rainy Thursday on the Avenue Thought I heard you talking so fast I turned on the lights, the TV, and the radio Still I can't escape the ghost of you What is happening?

2078
02:46:24,358 --> 02:46:29,122
[SPEAKER_13]: From Step Squad to Orange Lounge, this PDR sucks!

2079
02:46:33,706 --> 02:46:36,128
[SPEAKER_13]: Holla!

2080
02:46:38,711 --> 02:46:40,132
[SPEAKER_22]: We're back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

2081
02:46:40,372 --> 02:46:42,794
[SPEAKER_22]: We need more celebrity promos like that, actually.

2082
02:46:42,954 --> 02:46:44,516
[SPEAKER_22]: We need more promos in general.

2083
02:46:44,596 --> 02:46:47,158
[SPEAKER_22]: We just need to go out with a tape recorder and get more promos.

2084
02:46:47,338 --> 02:46:48,199
[SPEAKER_22]: I'll do a promo.

2085
02:46:48,639 --> 02:46:49,200
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, God.

2086
02:46:50,410 --> 02:46:54,917
[SPEAKER_22]: Remember, the promos run all day long, though, on the station, so you have to keep it G-rated, because people do listen to us at work.

2087
02:46:56,148 --> 02:47:00,312
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2088
02:47:20,228 --> 02:47:28,655
[SPEAKER_22]: Hoppin' Choppin' from DDR Mario, of course, they're kind of interworking in that song from, what the hell was it, Mario Brothers 2?

2089
02:47:29,596 --> 02:47:32,598
[SPEAKER_22]: God's like, one of my favorite video games of all time, I can't remember the damn name of it.

2090
02:47:33,059 --> 02:47:37,562
[SPEAKER_22]: And then, Aurora, featuring Amy Coleman, Ordinary World, of course.

2091
02:47:37,662 --> 02:47:41,866
[SPEAKER_22]: Another trance remix of an old song, another thing you love, DarkSakura, yes?

2092
02:47:42,666 --> 02:47:46,409
[SPEAKER_22]: When people take 70s and 80s songs, and I particularly hate that version.

2093
02:47:47,190 --> 02:47:48,191
[SPEAKER_22]: I have a version of that by Utada Hikaru.

2094
02:48:09,810 --> 02:48:16,331
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, I'm sure that's fine, but close to you has been done like a million times, and this one was especially offensive.

2095
02:48:18,052 --> 02:48:18,572
[SPEAKER_22]: All right, anyway.

2096
02:48:19,992 --> 02:48:22,773
[SPEAKER_22]: We need to get to the FUs of the week, because I'll be damned if we're not running out of show time.

2097
02:48:22,813 --> 02:48:28,054
[SPEAKER_22]: So chat room, when you guys send in your FUs tonight, you need to keep it short, because if you don't keep it short, you're getting cut off.

2098
02:48:29,254 --> 02:48:30,234
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm cutting you off tonight.

2099
02:48:31,694 --> 02:48:33,415
[SPEAKER_22]: So we're going to get into the FUs.

2100
02:48:33,455 --> 02:48:35,455
[SPEAKER_04]: So just say fuck you to Rob, and that's it.

2101
02:48:37,336 --> 02:48:39,196
[SPEAKER_22]: Extifer, I will take that microphone away from you.

2102
02:48:41,567 --> 02:48:43,788
[SPEAKER_22]: Bugged, will you please babysit Extifer?

2103
02:48:44,048 --> 02:48:46,170
[SPEAKER_22]: That's going to be your new official show title, Bugged.

2104
02:48:46,190 --> 02:48:47,951
[SPEAKER_22]: You're Extifer's babysitter.

2105
02:48:48,091 --> 02:48:49,151
Get it out of your ass!

2106
02:48:53,594 --> 02:48:54,114
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, lordy.

2107
02:48:54,234 --> 02:48:54,534
[SPEAKER_22]: All right.

2108
02:48:56,035 --> 02:48:59,857
[SPEAKER_22]: In order for us to have the FUs of the week, I better get DarkSakura's song ready.

2109
02:48:59,937 --> 02:49:02,699
[SPEAKER_22]: All right, DarkSakura, why is it that we do the FUs of the week every single week?

2110
02:49:03,319 --> 02:49:04,340
[SPEAKER_06]: Grr, argh.

2111
02:49:07,093 --> 02:49:24,967
[SPEAKER_06]: FU goes toward all of the traffic on my way up here FU goes toward internet stalkers FU goes toward my rash and amoxicillin and the fact that my ass itches

2112
02:49:27,379 --> 02:49:35,545
[SPEAKER_06]: And F you to Blackboard for being down all day because ARC's website was down and I couldn't do my homework.

2113
02:49:35,685 --> 02:49:36,985
[SPEAKER_06]: So fuck all that, I'm done.

2114
02:49:39,027 --> 02:49:39,947
[SPEAKER_22]: Moving on to Loki!

2115
02:49:42,809 --> 02:49:45,191
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, well anyways, what?

2116
02:49:46,412 --> 02:49:47,713
[SPEAKER_03]: What the hell is your problem?

2117
02:49:50,514 --> 02:49:50,895
[SPEAKER_22]: What?

2118
02:49:51,315 --> 02:49:51,995
[SPEAKER_22]: It's my song.

2119
02:49:52,236 --> 02:49:55,938
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyways, um, fuck you McDonald's for making subpar food.

2120
02:49:56,534 --> 02:50:00,836
[SPEAKER_22]: and until they recently fixed their cups for making cups that explode in my cup holders.

2121
02:50:01,577 --> 02:50:02,597
[SPEAKER_22]: Because that fucking sucks.

2122
02:50:02,837 --> 02:50:06,720
[SPEAKER_22]: And also fuck you to my neighbors who keep throwing their couches in the goddamn dumpster.

2123
02:50:07,380 --> 02:50:10,642
[SPEAKER_22]: That is not what the dumpster is for, it's for trash, not your fucking furniture.

2124
02:50:11,202 --> 02:50:14,163
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, pay for it to be hauled away like everyone else.

2125
02:50:15,324 --> 02:50:22,508
[SPEAKER_22]: And also, um, fuck you to winning this stupid free online, um, film, uh,

2126
02:50:24,147 --> 02:50:24,547
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, whatever.

2127
02:50:24,848 --> 02:50:26,409
[SPEAKER_22]: I hate that fucking Monopoly game.

2128
02:50:26,669 --> 02:50:30,352
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm done.

2129
02:50:39,659 --> 02:50:52,850
[SPEAKER_22]: I'd like to give an F you this week to Paranoia Survivor Max for showing up way more than it's welcome on the totally random DDR stream matchup, but it's a good thing my life doesn't revolve around DDR, or I might be upset about that, huh?

2130
02:50:54,246 --> 02:51:04,055
[SPEAKER_22]: I'd also like to give an F you to the fact that I feel really, really unprepared for something that's about to take place a week from tomorrow and I'm not excited about it, but that's alright, life sucks sometimes.

2131
02:51:04,095 --> 02:51:04,495
[SPEAKER_22]: Is it my birthday?

2132
02:51:05,076 --> 02:51:05,937
[SPEAKER_22]: No, it's not your birthday.

2133
02:51:06,217 --> 02:51:06,637
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes it is.

2134
02:51:06,898 --> 02:51:09,440
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, I mean, yes it is your birthday, but that's not why I'm mad.

2135
02:51:09,940 --> 02:51:10,321
[SPEAKER_22]: Shut up!

2136
02:51:10,681 --> 02:51:12,423
[SPEAKER_22]: This is my segment.

2137
02:51:13,183 --> 02:51:17,968
[SPEAKER_22]: And then an F you to rainbows, like the one on next to her shirt.

2138
02:51:19,326 --> 02:51:28,931
[SPEAKER_22]: FU to fuel prices, of course 325 for the low end on diesel, which is kind of crappy The anti-FU to that is, I'm still getting 45 miles a gallon And another FU is to extra fur as well Tyco drums Do they have to be so fucking loud?

2139
02:51:28,971 --> 02:51:29,291
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's all

2140
02:51:49,733 --> 02:51:50,153
[SPEAKER_16]: Extoverb.

2141
02:51:51,734 --> 02:51:52,935
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, fuck you, bugs.

2142
02:51:54,336 --> 02:51:55,016
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, no, no, no, no.

2143
02:51:55,316 --> 02:52:04,301
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have really any FUs other than, uh, let's see, FU to things that suck.

2144
02:52:05,882 --> 02:52:06,583
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I don't know.

2145
02:52:06,663 --> 02:52:10,605
[SPEAKER_04]: No, not FU to things that suck, because things that suck are sometimes really good.

2146
02:52:16,684 --> 02:52:18,445
[SPEAKER_04]: That's looking at me like, hurry up and finish!

2147
02:52:19,125 --> 02:52:19,746
[SPEAKER_04]: That's done!

2148
02:52:19,766 --> 02:52:20,346
[SPEAKER_04]: It's done!

2149
02:52:20,386 --> 02:52:22,187
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay, you need to say something.

2150
02:52:22,247 --> 02:52:23,427
[SPEAKER_04]: I climaxed.

2151
02:52:23,487 --> 02:52:24,908
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm done, I'm done, okay.

2152
02:52:25,288 --> 02:52:26,089
[SPEAKER_04]: Sexual reference.

2153
02:52:26,889 --> 02:52:27,029
[SPEAKER_22]: End.

2154
02:52:29,651 --> 02:52:30,151
[SPEAKER_22]: Chat room time.

2155
02:52:31,712 --> 02:52:35,273
[SPEAKER_22]: Socorina says, F you to Sean Paul for making Get Busy.

2156
02:52:36,774 --> 02:52:41,336
[SPEAKER_22]: Miklatov says, my first F you goes to anyone who likes V. Get over the song, it fucking sucks.

02:53:16,203 --> 02:53:18,744
[SPEAKER_22]: Happy birthday, fuck you.

2168
02:53:18,764 --> 02:53:19,444
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, that's it.

2169
02:53:22,365 --> 02:53:22,806
[SPEAKER_22]: Just kidding.

2170
02:53:22,846 --> 02:53:23,386
[SPEAKER_22]: Happy birthday.

2171
02:53:24,706 --> 02:53:26,887
[SPEAKER_22]: Sycoon says, hey, fuck you.

2172
02:53:28,788 --> 02:53:32,189
[SPEAKER_22]: At J-0-0, not the other kind, because that would be offensive.

2173
02:53:34,752 --> 02:53:41,116
[SPEAKER_22]: Fireboma says, F you to Con Edison for not restoring power in my house for 28 hours after a storm.

2174
02:53:43,378 --> 02:53:47,901
[SPEAKER_22]: Roz says, F you to the gorilla's unofficial chat for making me addicted to Pokemon again.

2175
02:53:49,062 --> 02:53:50,263
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, what's up with that?

2176
02:53:50,644 --> 02:53:51,404
[SPEAKER_22]: What is up with that?

2177
02:53:52,205 --> 02:53:56,248
[SPEAKER_22]: DarkTetsuya says, F you to the guy who had us all convinced he had memories.

2178
02:53:56,828 --> 02:53:59,950
[SPEAKER_22]: Of course he did, it's already unlocked on the Japanese version.

2179
02:54:00,922 --> 02:54:02,343
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh my god, this is classic.

2180
02:54:02,403 --> 02:54:11,847
[SPEAKER_22]: Side note, you guys, on the DDR Freak forums, you know how there's this big stink that in DDR Extreme, Memories is like a hidden song that's actually on the disc, but nobody knows how to unlock the song in the game?

2181
02:54:12,187 --> 02:54:17,549
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, some guy comes on there and says, My Memories has been in DDR Extreme the whole time, I don't know what you guys are freaking out about.

2182
02:54:19,350 --> 02:54:20,651
[SPEAKER_22]: And they're like, Oh yeah?

2183
02:54:20,911 --> 02:54:22,011
[SPEAKER_22]: Send us a screenshot!

2184
02:54:22,371 --> 02:54:25,093
[SPEAKER_22]: And he sends a screenshot, and it's the Japanese version of Extreme.

2185
02:54:28,214 --> 02:54:29,615
[SPEAKER_22]: And he took six points of damage!

2186
02:54:32,627 --> 02:54:39,391
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, and FU to the live 365 keeps kicking me off stream and skipping so I miss most of the show.

2187
02:54:42,133 --> 02:54:46,256
[SPEAKER_22]: BlackDevilerX says, froke you to the fact that I haven't been able to listen to the show in forever.

2188
02:54:47,477 --> 02:54:54,722
[SPEAKER_22]: Acer800 says, FU to Sky for playing DDR Mario and Ordinary World back to back because it makes me too happy to have any real FUs.

2189
02:54:56,738 --> 02:55:01,081
[SPEAKER_22]: SSJ100Matt says, F you to New York Yankee haters.

2190
02:55:01,161 --> 02:55:02,962
[SPEAKER_22]: You can't hate a team for winning too much.

2191
02:55:03,042 --> 02:55:03,963
[SPEAKER_22]: Let's go Yankees.

2192
02:55:06,164 --> 02:55:09,747
[SPEAKER_22]: Laquitas says, I should know this guy's name.

2193
02:55:09,787 --> 02:55:10,948
[SPEAKER_22]: I play Final Fantasy XI with him.

2194
02:55:11,268 --> 02:55:15,371
[SPEAKER_22]: Says, F you to play online for not allowing me to log in so I can play Final Fantasy XI.

2195
02:55:15,411 --> 02:55:16,431
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, that's actually from Anna.

2196
02:55:16,571 --> 02:55:18,172
[SPEAKER_22]: Sorry.

2197
02:55:18,733 --> 02:55:23,456
[SPEAKER_22]: One more F you to the water leaking in our ceiling and causing horrible house maintenance problems.

2198
02:55:23,476 --> 02:55:24,577
[SPEAKER_22]: That's actually from Anala.

2199
02:55:24,737 --> 02:55:24,897
[SPEAKER_22]: Sorry.

2200
02:55:27,401 --> 02:55:30,882
[SPEAKER_22]: Goggle says, Froke having two physics labs due on the same day.

2201
02:55:33,002 --> 02:55:40,444
[SPEAKER_22]: Kai of Blur says, two things, F you to my communications class having a speech on Tuesday when I'm still sick.

2202
02:55:40,644 --> 02:55:44,005
[SPEAKER_22]: Also, fuck 4chan.org, the black hole of the internet.

2203
02:55:44,045 --> 02:55:44,945
[SPEAKER_22]: God bless it.

2204
02:55:47,226 --> 02:55:53,267
[SPEAKER_22]: Nintendo Maniac 64 says, F you Midway for delaying the GameCube version of Midway Arcade Treasures 3 by a month.

2205
02:55:54,844 --> 02:56:00,628
[SPEAKER_22]: Legend of Zaku says, F you to not having a freestyle routine ready for this Saturday's major tournament in the Digital Life Expo in New York City.

2206
02:56:01,208 --> 02:56:04,630
[SPEAKER_22]: F you to the LA Angels for nearly eliminating the Yankees in the playoffs.

2207
02:56:06,871 --> 02:56:09,933
[SPEAKER_22]: And Floatwalk says, from Melody, F you to Poland.

2208
02:56:12,195 --> 02:56:13,555
[SPEAKER_22]: Just the whole country, fuck them all.

2209
02:56:13,635 --> 02:56:14,216
[SPEAKER_22]: Egypt's better.

2210
02:56:15,116 --> 02:56:15,617
[SPEAKER_22]: Fuck them all.

2211
02:56:16,537 --> 02:56:18,338
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright, just kidding if you're Polish, just kidding.

2212
02:56:18,358 --> 02:56:20,780
[SPEAKER_22]: There's obviously an inside joke there that you don't know about if you got offended.

2213
02:56:20,800 --> 02:56:22,261
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm of Polish descent.

2214
02:56:22,321 --> 02:56:24,322
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, obviously, there's an inside joke, so don't take it seriously.

2215
02:56:24,824 --> 02:56:25,805
[SPEAKER_06]: So fuck me.

2216
02:56:27,907 --> 02:56:28,668
[SPEAKER_22]: No thank you, I'll leave it.

2217
02:56:28,688 --> 02:56:30,730
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, Will Smith doesn't have to cuss to sell records.

2218
02:56:31,630 --> 02:56:32,211
[SPEAKER_06]: But I do.

2219
02:56:32,671 --> 02:56:34,313
[SPEAKER_06]: So fuck him, and fuck you too.

2220
02:56:34,333 --> 02:56:36,455
[SPEAKER_22]: Isn't that a lyric?

2221
02:56:36,735 --> 02:56:38,377
[SPEAKER_22]: Isn't that a lyric in a song somewhere?

2222
02:56:38,577 --> 02:56:40,479
[SPEAKER_06]: It's from an Eminem song.

2223
02:56:40,539 --> 02:56:42,461
[SPEAKER_22]: I cuss when I've heard that lyric somewhere before.

2224
02:56:42,841 --> 02:56:44,262
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, Will Smith really prides himself on it.

2225
02:56:44,302 --> 02:56:45,363
[SPEAKER_22]: He doesn't curse in his music.

2226
02:56:45,384 --> 02:56:48,807
[SPEAKER_22]: But he samples everybody.

2227
02:56:49,628 --> 02:56:50,028
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, he does.

2228
02:56:52,861 --> 02:56:54,042
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, we had one late FU.

2229
02:56:54,682 --> 02:56:57,383
[SPEAKER_22]: Morty says, Froke, Frigid Roommates.

2230
02:56:59,124 --> 02:56:59,624
[SPEAKER_22]: Frigid Roommates.

2231
02:56:59,644 --> 02:57:00,124
[SPEAKER_22]: I agree.

2232
02:57:01,144 --> 02:57:02,225
[SPEAKER_22]: Shut up, asshole.

2233
02:57:03,205 --> 02:57:04,126
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm not frigid.

2234
02:57:05,586 --> 02:57:07,207
[SPEAKER_22]: I'll have you know, I was quite warm.

2235
02:57:07,327 --> 02:57:07,627
[SPEAKER_22]: Never mind.

2236
02:57:07,647 --> 02:57:09,588
[SPEAKER_22]: She's kidding.

2237
02:57:09,628 --> 02:57:09,928
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm kidding.

2238
02:57:09,968 --> 02:57:10,248
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm kidding.

2239
02:57:10,929 --> 02:57:11,269
[SPEAKER_22]: All right.

2240
02:57:12,964 --> 02:57:14,324
[SPEAKER_22]: God, we're running out of time on the show.

2241
02:57:14,344 --> 02:57:15,545
[SPEAKER_22]: They want to do Ask Orange Lounge.

2242
02:57:15,585 --> 02:57:18,005
[SPEAKER_22]: We don't really have the time, so I think we're going to have to... That's it.

2243
02:57:18,025 --> 02:57:18,785
[SPEAKER_22]: You want to do it real quick?

2244
02:57:18,825 --> 02:57:19,465
[SPEAKER_22]: Just do it.

2245
02:57:19,726 --> 02:57:20,266
[SPEAKER_22]: All right.

2246
02:57:20,346 --> 02:57:22,706
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, because we still got the podcast to do, and you want to go out.

2247
02:57:23,586 --> 02:57:23,906
[SPEAKER_22]: I know.

2248
02:57:24,267 --> 02:57:24,547
[SPEAKER_22]: All right.

2249
02:57:25,247 --> 02:57:28,348
[SPEAKER_06]: But where would we be without our fans?

2250
02:57:28,528 --> 02:57:29,308
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably in bed.

2251
02:57:29,408 --> 02:57:29,768
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2252
02:57:31,248 --> 02:57:32,088
[SPEAKER_04]: Doing what in bed?

2253
02:57:32,288 --> 02:57:32,688
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

2254
02:57:33,649 --> 02:57:34,309
[SPEAKER_06]: Summer party!

2255
02:57:37,386 --> 02:57:39,407
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright guys, fine, we'll do really quick.

2256
02:57:39,427 --> 02:57:47,729
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember going to slumber parties with a bunch of people and the first girl who fell asleep, we would take her bra and stuff, like dip it in orange juice and put it in the freezer.

2257
02:57:48,229 --> 02:57:51,110
[SPEAKER_04]: My sister and her friend did that to one of their friends one time.

2258
02:57:51,610 --> 02:57:52,430
[SPEAKER_04]: It was really funny.

2259
02:57:52,570 --> 02:58:00,792
[SPEAKER_06]: And then when the last person to stay awake would go and put toothpaste on the toilet seat so that the first person who woke up in half-asleep mode to go use the bathroom would stick to the toilet.

2260
02:58:06,014 --> 02:58:06,254
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow.

2261
02:58:13,044 --> 02:58:15,986
[SPEAKER_22]: Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.

2262
02:58:16,486 --> 02:58:19,688
[SPEAKER_22]: What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?

2263
02:58:20,209 --> 02:58:21,770
[SPEAKER_22]: I think it's very interesting.

2264
02:58:22,070 --> 02:58:27,173
[SPEAKER_22]: We didn't even need a question to find out that Jamie played with other girls' bras.

2265
02:58:34,192 --> 02:58:36,993
[SPEAKER_22]: Fireboma said, where do babies come from?

2266
02:58:37,213 --> 02:58:38,833
[SPEAKER_22]: No, seriously, I don't know.

2267
02:58:39,253 --> 02:58:42,534
[SPEAKER_22]: I will let Extifer answer this question on behalf of Orange Lounge Radio.

2268
02:58:42,634 --> 02:58:44,655
[SPEAKER_22]: Extifer, where do babies come from?

2269
02:58:45,035 --> 02:58:47,195
[SPEAKER_04]: Babies come from a female's coo.

2270
02:58:51,136 --> 02:58:55,077
[SPEAKER_22]: Legend of Zaku said, you guys seriously need a Wikipedia entry.

2271
02:58:55,737 --> 02:58:56,117
[SPEAKER_22]: We do.

2272
02:58:56,157 --> 02:58:56,837
[SPEAKER_22]: How do we do that?

2273
02:58:57,578 --> 02:58:58,878
[SPEAKER_22]: Someone has to make us one.

2274
02:58:59,804 --> 02:59:00,705
[SPEAKER_22]: Somebody make us one.

2275
02:59:00,985 --> 02:59:01,807
[SPEAKER_22]: Is Bug gonna do it?

2276
02:59:02,387 --> 02:59:03,429
[SPEAKER_22]: Bug's working on it right now.

2277
02:59:03,489 --> 02:59:05,771
[SPEAKER_22]: Do people have to vote on it to make it stick?

2278
02:59:06,232 --> 02:59:06,552
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, good.

2279
02:59:06,933 --> 02:59:08,195
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, Bug's gonna write that right now.

2280
02:59:08,555 --> 02:59:09,156
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Zaku.

2281
02:59:09,176 --> 02:59:10,337
[SPEAKER_22]: The ferret needs an entry, too.

2282
02:59:10,417 --> 02:59:11,098
[SPEAKER_22]: We'll post that, though.

2283
02:59:11,479 --> 02:59:14,142
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, other things I want to point out...

2284
02:59:15,612 --> 02:59:20,554
[SPEAKER_22]: Vote us a 5 on your player window in Line365, speaking of voting stuff.

2285
02:59:20,854 --> 02:59:24,975
[SPEAKER_22]: And for the love of God, vote for us on Podcast Alley, because we're really falling behind over there.

2286
02:59:25,275 --> 02:59:29,517
[SPEAKER_22]: So for your convenience, I'm going to post a link to where you can vote for our show.

2287
02:59:29,557 --> 02:59:34,839
[SPEAKER_22]: And you should do that right now, because that's a really good way for our podcast to get exposure.

2288
02:59:39,770 --> 02:59:41,091
[SPEAKER_22]: I hate that podcast.

2289
02:59:41,991 --> 02:59:42,612
[SPEAKER_22]: It's a gas.

2290
02:59:44,113 --> 02:59:44,393
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright.

2291
02:59:45,974 --> 02:59:46,994
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, did somebody already do it?

2292
02:59:49,756 --> 02:59:51,297
[SPEAKER_22]: Somebody posted a Wikipedia link.

2293
02:59:51,417 --> 02:59:52,177
[SPEAKER_22]: Did somebody already do it?

2294
02:59:53,818 --> 02:59:55,739
[SPEAKER_22]: Somebody probably just made an entry that says, it sucks.

2295
02:59:56,720 --> 02:59:57,440
[SPEAKER_22]: It stinks!

2296
02:59:59,601 --> 03:00:00,282
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, no, it's not there.

2297
03:00:00,302 --> 03:00:00,562
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

2298
03:00:01,002 --> 03:00:01,663
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, you need to start.

2299
03:00:01,703 --> 03:00:02,843
[SPEAKER_22]: Somebody needs to hurry up and write it.

2300
03:00:03,664 --> 03:00:03,924
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright.

2301
03:00:05,814 --> 03:00:11,476
[SPEAKER_22]: Sakurina says, why is American Thanksgiving later than Canadian Thanksgiving, which is now?

2302
03:00:12,137 --> 03:00:13,037
Wait a second!

2303
03:00:13,297 --> 03:00:14,037
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh yes, Loki.

2304
03:00:14,538 --> 03:00:17,039
[SPEAKER_22]: Why do the Canadians get Thanksgiving anyways?

2305
03:00:17,059 --> 03:00:18,579
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, how many Indians did they kill?

2306
03:00:18,699 --> 03:00:19,039
[SPEAKER_22]: Come on.

2307
03:00:19,520 --> 03:00:20,280
[SPEAKER_22]: Exactly.

2308
03:00:20,820 --> 03:00:22,261
[SPEAKER_22]: They didn't rape the land of Indians.

2309
03:00:24,835 --> 03:00:26,135
[SPEAKER_22]: No, just kidding.

2310
03:00:27,436 --> 03:00:29,216
[SPEAKER_22]: God, we're horribly offensive sometimes.

2311
03:00:29,276 --> 03:00:30,776
[SPEAKER_22]: I really hope we didn't offend anybody with that comment.

2312
03:00:31,116 --> 03:00:35,598
[SPEAKER_22]: But if anything, they should be giving thanks for maple syrup because that's what they're known for.

2313
03:00:36,058 --> 03:00:36,978
[SPEAKER_22]: That and Bryan Adams.

2314
03:00:37,478 --> 03:00:39,618
[SPEAKER_22]: I really don't know why Thanksgiving is later.

2315
03:00:42,059 --> 03:00:45,120
[SPEAKER_22]: It's all timed for the shopping industry.

2316
03:00:45,140 --> 03:00:47,200
[SPEAKER_06]: They gave us Atlantis, Rob.

2317
03:00:47,840 --> 03:00:48,481
[SPEAKER_22]: I know, I know.

2318
03:00:48,721 --> 03:00:49,861
[SPEAKER_16]: And Bryan Adams.

2319
03:00:51,841 --> 03:00:52,822
[SPEAKER_16]: And William Shatner.

2320
03:00:53,622 --> 03:00:54,402
[SPEAKER_16]: Where would we be

2321
03:00:56,812 --> 03:00:58,913
[SPEAKER_04]: Wasn't Michael J. Fox from Canada?

2322
03:00:59,954 --> 03:01:01,335
[SPEAKER_04]: What about David Duchovny?

2323
03:01:02,055 --> 03:01:06,578
[SPEAKER_06]: You remember that song, David Duchovny, Why Won't You Love Me?

2324
03:01:07,378 --> 03:01:07,659
[SPEAKER_22]: No.

2325
03:01:08,299 --> 03:01:09,500
[SPEAKER_06]: Someone wrote a song about him.

2326
03:01:09,800 --> 03:01:14,663
[SPEAKER_22]: If somebody in the chatroom is saying that DDR Freak is not allowed to have a Wikipedia entry, so why should we?

2327
03:01:15,111 --> 03:01:16,832
[SPEAKER_22]: Who said DDR Free is not allowed to have a Wikipedia entry?

2328
03:01:16,852 --> 03:01:17,393
[SPEAKER_22]: That's not cool!

2329
03:01:17,433 --> 03:01:19,435
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, make them one!

2330
03:01:20,696 --> 03:01:22,777
[SPEAKER_22]: I think they had one and it got removed or something.

2331
03:01:23,118 --> 03:01:24,299
[SPEAKER_22]: Somebody probably complained about it.

2332
03:01:25,159 --> 03:01:30,844
[SPEAKER_22]: Dude, if we get a Wikipedia entry posted, just fucking don't complain about it and we'll be fine.

2333
03:01:30,924 --> 03:01:32,065
[SPEAKER_22]: So don't tattle.

2334
03:01:32,385 --> 03:01:35,988
[SPEAKER_22]: If you tattle, I will come find you and beat you up and it will not be a good thing.

2335
03:01:36,609 --> 03:01:38,971
[SPEAKER_22]: Because you'll probably end up beating Rafa.

2336
03:01:41,837 --> 03:01:52,304
[SPEAKER_22]: Jaded2005 says, why is it cheaper to rent movies and expensive to rent video games?

2337
03:01:54,226 --> 03:01:55,747
[SPEAKER_22]: Because video games are more expensive than movies.

2338
03:01:55,787 --> 03:01:57,168
[SPEAKER_22]: Video games set you back like 50 bucks.

2339
03:01:57,308 --> 03:01:59,469
[SPEAKER_22]: Movies now only set you back like 25.

2340
03:01:59,629 --> 03:02:03,352
[SPEAKER_22]: Exactly, and they have to rent more times in order to make their money back.

2341
03:02:05,794 --> 03:02:07,675
[SPEAKER_22]: And stop stealing games, people!

2342
03:02:08,319 --> 03:02:10,040
[SPEAKER_22]: Stop stealing them from the rental stores.

2343
03:02:10,060 --> 03:02:11,081
[SPEAKER_22]: That's what the internet's for.

2344
03:02:12,582 --> 03:02:14,404
[SPEAKER_22]: If I mispronounce this, I'm really sorry.

2345
03:02:14,524 --> 03:02:20,168
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know if it's just E or just with like the silent E. I'm not sure if the E is silent or not.

2346
03:02:20,328 --> 03:02:21,149
[SPEAKER_22]: I think just.

2347
03:02:21,509 --> 03:02:22,330
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm going to go with just.

2348
03:02:23,951 --> 03:02:24,772
[SPEAKER_22]: It could be just day.

2349
03:02:24,972 --> 03:02:28,855
[SPEAKER_22]: It could be like just day, like Jack A. This person is going to kick my ass.

2350
03:02:29,075 --> 03:02:29,855
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm going to go with just.

2351
03:02:29,935 --> 03:02:30,196
[SPEAKER_22]: All right.

2352
03:02:30,716 --> 03:02:33,778
[SPEAKER_22]: Why did you decide to start making an online radio show?

2353
03:02:33,798 --> 03:02:34,199
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

2354
03:02:35,390 --> 03:02:42,299
[SPEAKER_22]: Meep, personally, I've been doing online radio personally since I was in college, which was a long time ago.

2355
03:02:43,200 --> 03:02:51,370
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm actually not that old, but I was doing a college radio show and then I got invited to be on another internet radio program called Under Sedation Live.

2356
03:02:51,730 --> 03:02:58,634
[SPEAKER_22]: That was years ago, and that just kind of turned into this, where it was like, you know what, we have fun doing Understation Live, let's do a show about video games.

2357
03:02:58,914 --> 03:03:00,074
[SPEAKER_22]: And sure enough, here we are.

2358
03:03:00,375 --> 03:03:02,256
[SPEAKER_22]: DarkSakura was a frequent guest on that show.

2359
03:03:02,636 --> 03:03:05,858
[SPEAKER_22]: Loki just kind of showed up, but it worked out, so Loki's still here.

2360
03:03:09,700 --> 03:03:10,420
[SPEAKER_22]: Juice Day.

2361
03:03:10,540 --> 03:03:11,401
[SPEAKER_22]: It is Juice Day.

2362
03:03:13,101 --> 03:03:14,782
[SPEAKER_22]: Not Just Day, but Juice Day.

2363
03:03:15,743 --> 03:03:16,443
[SPEAKER_22]: Just for the record.

2364
03:03:17,604 --> 03:03:17,864
[SPEAKER_22]: All right.

2365
03:03:20,479 --> 03:03:37,746
[SPEAKER_22]: SSJ100 Matt wants to know, I may be the only person on Earth to break an afterburner pad.

2366
03:03:38,146 --> 03:03:39,527
[SPEAKER_22]: Am I the only one to break one?

2367
03:03:40,947 --> 03:03:40,987
[SPEAKER_22]: No.

2368
03:03:42,908 --> 03:03:43,148
[SPEAKER_22]: No.

2369
03:03:43,488 --> 03:03:44,068
[SPEAKER_22]: Loki says no.

2370
03:03:44,148 --> 03:03:45,349
[SPEAKER_22]: How do you know this for a fact, Loki?

2371
03:03:46,843 --> 03:03:49,764
[SPEAKER_22]: That's ridiculous to say that you're the only person that's broken one.

2372
03:03:49,924 --> 03:03:51,044
[SPEAKER_22]: They're not indestructible.

2373
03:03:51,724 --> 03:03:57,305
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm sure at some point, like, somebody who weighed like 700 pounds tried to play on one and probably broke it.

2374
03:03:57,546 --> 03:03:59,566
[SPEAKER_22]: So, I think that's safe to say, wouldn't you?

2375
03:04:00,646 --> 03:04:00,846
[SPEAKER_22]: Sure.

2376
03:04:00,866 --> 03:04:04,047
[SPEAKER_22]: You're probably not the first, but you might be one of a very select few.

2377
03:04:04,887 --> 03:04:06,048
[SPEAKER_22]: And that's something to be proud about.

2378
03:04:07,448 --> 03:04:07,828
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, no.

2379
03:04:09,268 --> 03:04:10,669
[SPEAKER_22]: Lastly, last question here.

2380
03:04:10,689 --> 03:04:11,549
[SPEAKER_22]: I hope this is a good one.

2381
03:04:11,969 --> 03:04:12,089
[SPEAKER_22]: Um...

2382
03:04:13,624 --> 03:04:18,973
[SPEAKER_22]: Nintendomaniac64 Why did Midway delay the GameCube version of Midway Arcade Treasures 3?

2383
03:04:20,635 --> 03:04:23,520
[SPEAKER_22]: And why did my laptop just lag for like 12 minutes straight?

2384
03:04:23,988 --> 03:04:27,549
[SPEAKER_22]: GameCube games seem to be getting finished last.

2385
03:04:27,849 --> 03:04:31,249
[SPEAKER_22]: Like, for example, Rainbow Six Lockdown didn't come out until two weeks later.

2386
03:04:31,889 --> 03:04:35,270
[SPEAKER_22]: Same with Midway Arcade Treasures doesn't come out until two weeks later.

2387
03:04:35,290 --> 03:04:38,150
[SPEAKER_22]: One of the Mortal Kombat games came out way later for GameCube 2, right?

2388
03:04:38,190 --> 03:04:39,511
[SPEAKER_22]: The Deception.

2389
03:04:39,751 --> 03:04:47,332
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, it's just, I don't know, either they have to go through some process of, you know, Nintendo has to review it or something, or I don't know.

2390
03:04:47,812 --> 03:04:49,092
[SPEAKER_22]: For whatever reason, it gets delayed.

2391
03:04:51,313 --> 03:04:51,953
[SPEAKER_22]: Very interesting.

2392
03:04:52,733 --> 03:04:52,993
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright.

2393
03:04:54,090 --> 03:04:55,610
[SPEAKER_22]: We've got to call it a show, boys and girls.

2394
03:04:55,710 --> 03:04:56,351
[SPEAKER_22]: We're done here.

2395
03:04:56,451 --> 03:04:58,751
[SPEAKER_22]: And sorry, Nintendo Mania, I can't help you with your laptop.

2396
03:04:59,891 --> 03:05:01,852
[SPEAKER_22]: Call your local computer experts.

2397
03:05:02,452 --> 03:05:02,712
[SPEAKER_22]: All right.

2398
03:05:03,973 --> 03:05:04,873
[SPEAKER_22]: Final thoughts, you guys.

2399
03:05:04,913 --> 03:05:05,533
[SPEAKER_22]: It's the end of the show.

2400
03:05:05,593 --> 03:05:06,373
[SPEAKER_22]: Bugs, your final thought.

2401
03:05:08,414 --> 03:05:09,454
[SPEAKER_16]: I like my PSP.

2402
03:05:10,434 --> 03:05:11,374
[SPEAKER_16]: Extifer, your final thought.

2403
03:05:14,155 --> 03:05:14,675
[SPEAKER_04]: Stop it.

2404
03:05:16,076 --> 03:05:18,376
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like his PSP.

2405
03:05:20,297 --> 03:05:21,097
[SPEAKER_22]: Loki, your final thought.

2406
03:05:24,392 --> 03:05:26,196
[SPEAKER_22]: I have too many GameStop receipts.

2407
03:05:26,677 --> 03:05:28,039
[SPEAKER_22]: My final thought is, meow.

2408
03:05:29,141 --> 03:05:29,622
[SPEAKER_22]: DarkSakura?

2409
03:05:30,444 --> 03:05:31,706
[SPEAKER_06]: Reject false icons.

2410
03:05:31,807 --> 03:05:32,688
[SPEAKER_06]: Bleach your Katamari.

2411
03:05:34,073 --> 03:05:35,374
[SPEAKER_22]: DarkSakura, what is tonight's final word?

2412
03:05:59,153 --> 03:06:00,854
[SPEAKER_22]: That does it for another... Hold on.

2413
03:06:00,954 --> 03:06:01,674
[SPEAKER_22]: That was two.

2414
03:06:01,834 --> 03:06:02,555
[SPEAKER_22]: That was two.

2415
03:06:02,975 --> 03:06:03,835
[SPEAKER_22]: You pick one.

2416
03:06:04,135 --> 03:06:05,256
[SPEAKER_22]: You pick one or the other.

2417
03:06:05,296 --> 03:06:07,337
[SPEAKER_06]: I had to quote the game, but it's itchy.

2418
03:06:08,637 --> 03:06:13,519
[SPEAKER_17]: That does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live.

2419
03:06:14,360 --> 03:06:18,541
[SPEAKER_17]: Orange Lounge Radio Live is an Orange Lounge Radio production.

2422
03:06:34,359 --> 03:06:45,186
I miss you more than Michael Bay missed the mark

2423
03:06:54,927 --> 03:07:18,449
[SPEAKER_11]: When he made Pearl Harbor I miss you more than that movie missed the point And that's an awful lot, girl And now, now you've gone away And all I'm trying to say is Pearl Harbor sucked And I miss you

2424
03:07:29,304 --> 03:07:55,447

2425
03:08:03,657 --> 03:08:07,559
Why does Michael beg to keep on making movies?

2426
03:08:07,739 --> 03:08:09,639
I guess Pearl Harbor sucks.

2427
03:08:25,041 --> 03:08:28,124
A little bit more than I miss you
