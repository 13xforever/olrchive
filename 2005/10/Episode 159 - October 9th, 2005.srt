1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,520
We dance united together, we are one

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,640
I'll take you there, baby, come go with me

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,440
Ah, barriba y barra

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,760
Y que choriba de toda

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:14,880
La toda la toda la toda la corazón

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,880
Barriba y barra

7
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,480
Y que choriba de toda la toda la corazón

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,480
Love you for my love and

9
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:41,480
I fell in love with your voice and your laughter

10
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:44,480
And just one smile always makes me believe

11
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,480
My destiny curious if you are mine

12
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,800
Oh, won't you tell me if we're meant to be?

13
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:41,480
When you dance with me, boy, I know you feel my needs more

14
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:48,480
When you dance with me, boy, I know you feel my needs, boy

15
00:01:48,480 --> 00:02:06,480
Mambo mambo teo, Mambo mambo teo

16
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,480
One, two, three!

17
00:02:36,480 --> 00:03:06,160
what's the point, it's like trying to shove a piano through a door when there's a perfectly

18
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:17,740
good window right there. I mean, I don't see the point. And that's why men will never have

19
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:29,320
babies. The genius of Loki on Orange Lounge Radio. The following live program is a special

20
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:36,320
presentation of Orange Lounge Radio.

21
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:50,040
Hello everybody, it is October 9th, 2005. You're tuned in to Orange Lounge Radio Live.

22
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:54,440
And we're about ready to kick off tonight's program. On tonight's program, we're going

23
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:58,280
to be talking a little bit about Extreme 2's online mode, because I got a chance to play

24
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:02,800
that this week. And we're also going to be talking a little bit about Tycho Drummaster

25
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:06,960
because X-Defer picked that up this week and he's like obsessed with Tycho Drummaster all

26
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:10,800
of a sudden. So we definitely have to talk to him about that and his movie reveal. All

27
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:14,560
that and all the other crap you're used to here on this lovely program known as Orange

28
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:21,560
Orange Lounge Radio, see you after this.

29
00:04:44,560 --> 00:05:13,560
You're mentioning the Orange Man Iridium Live, the body-talked radio, so much more.

30
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,560
Oh

31
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:18,820
God

32
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:21,140
Call me daddy

33
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:25,700
Orange lounge may contain adult content

34
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:29,840
Orange lounge may contain many four-letter words

35
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,660
Orange lounge may contain a scene of nudity

36
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:37,160
Orange lounge may contain plenty of

37
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:40,160
Muh-uh-muh-chuh-muh-kocky.

38
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,160
Just kidding, Orange Lounge Radio will not contain any of that.

39
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,160
In this episode...

40
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,160

My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Skye, joining me as always are my awesome

00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,080
co-hosts.

52
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,960
Not here right now is Dark Sakura!

53
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:55,880
Yeah, I'm actually not sure where she's at, I know she said something about homework was

54
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:59,040
probably going to delay her a little bit, but we'll see what's going on.

55
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:03,080
I'm sure she's gonna run through the door any minute now going traffic or the line at Safeway or something

56
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:09,040
So she'll be here any minute, but I we're here with us. And by the way, when dark Sakura does get here everybody

57
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,440
Just kidding I could never fire her she kicked my ass

58
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:18,320
Right here is the one and only Loki. Hello. How you doing, Loki?

59
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:24,080
Good, except I'm good in the you know, the department of developing pictures

60
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,200
I I will talk about this later because I want to talk about how stupid that thing is

61
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,200
So we'll talk about that in a little bit.

62
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,200
I noticed Loki is sporting his In the Courtroom shirt today.

63
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:36,200
So, those of you guys that won prizes a couple weeks ago, we finally got the In the Courtroom shirts.

64
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:40,200
So our grand prize winner, who won that? Justin and Icy, I think, won the haiku thing.

65
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:44,200
We're going to be sending the In the Courtroom shirt along with the In the Coop game this week.

66
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:48,200
And I'll tell you what, I can't say anything about something that's in the works right now,

67
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:52,200
but I'll be damned if this isn't the best week for us to be doing this.

68
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:58,200
It helps save it for next week because it's going to be great, that's all I can say.

69
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,200
Are you sure about irony?

70
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,200
Yeah, I know.

71
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:05,200
Anyway, we're here though and we're going to be talking about all sorts of other stuff.

72
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,200
Bugd is also here tonight, one of our guests.

73
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,200
Howdy.

74
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,200
How you doing?

75
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,200
Hi, I have a PSP.

76
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,200
And fuck traffic apparently.

77
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,200
I knew it.

78
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,200
What did I say?

79
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:19,200
I said she'd walk in here and she'd go fuck traffic or fuck the line at Safeway.

80
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,200
One of the two.

81
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,200
Hi DarkSakura, how are you?

82
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,200
Got your butt.

83
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,200
Next.

84
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,200
Alright.

85
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:33,200
So we're here, and we're about ready to get started with tonight's show.

86
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,200
Xtafur is out in the front room playing Tycho Drummaster.

87
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,200
My fault!

88
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,200
Yeah, your fault. I'll be talking to you about that later.

89
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,200
We'll get into that.

90
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,200
Meanwhile though, let's get tonight's show started.

91
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,200
Get your butt in the chatroom, Warrensonitrader.com.

92
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,200
We're going to come back, we're going to talk a little bit about

93
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:53,000
Something's going on in the Bomani scene, although it's kind of a slow news week because everybody's playing

94
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:59,200
Dance Dance Revolution Extreme 2. I want to talk about online mode a little bit though because I finally got into online mode today

95
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:04,000
It's very interesting and I can talk about my gaming router adventures and everything so it'll be fun. We're gonna have a fun show kids

96
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,640
We'll be back after this. We're gonna start it off this break with a song

97
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,760
That definitely had a lot of people talking last week. We're gonna talk about it a little bit more this week

98
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:14,920
But we're going to play the original uncensored version of Injection of Love.

99
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:21,920
We'll be back after this.

100
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:49,920
Oh, clover, won't you play with the emo?

101
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,940
Oh...

102
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,920
It's a miracle, it's a miracle

103
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:28,920
It's easy, but I'm made out of fortune and old

104
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:45,920
It's got to be your love

105
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:53,920
The only love I want and all You are the angel of my life

106
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:02,920
It's tough to see my heart Bein' beside you on my own at all

107
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:11,920
I wanna get closer to you, my love Until the day I die

108
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,420
I'll be your everything

109

Won't you change my hand?

112
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:23,920
But I will be a man

113
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,420
So tonight we're gonna dance the night away

114
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:28,920

Forever we're in the dark

122
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,920
Hey, I won't be a man for so long

123
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,920

140
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:50,200
has been done at two of Dark Sakura's places.

141
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:53,800
Yeah, because I moved once and then I moved again.

142
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,720
This show gets around quite a bit.

143
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,040
We're such a ho.

144
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,040
Yeah, that's right.

145
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,040
We're whores for you kids.

146
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,760
How are you doing tonight, this lovely Sunday evening?

147
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:04,560
I hear this constant pounding in my head tonight.

148
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,560
Just a constant pounding.

149
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:11,640
It's just extra for playing taiko drum master out in the living room.

150
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,640
Oops!

151
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,640
Dark Sakura, what the hell?

152
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,640
What did you do?

153
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:23,020
Friday night we had our supposed to be weekly Firefly marathon and we went out to do late

154
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:30,380
night lions and came back and I was actually hunting down the turbo duo to play some Dracula

155
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:40,100
X and instead Dan's like, put up your free taiko drum master, so I did and I have a RO

156
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:45,900
I'm not going to say the name, but I also have, of course, the original, because Dan

157
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,660
got all that for free for me.

158
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:51,840
And so we played, like, a bunch, unlike, like, two songs.

159
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,900
My hands were bruised by the time I was done.

160
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:57,420
And I won the watermelon contest.

161
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,420
The watermelon contest?

162
00:17:58,420 --> 00:17:59,420
The minigames.

163
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:00,420
Oh, and the minigames.

164
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:01,420
I haven't really played enough Ticodermism.

165
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:04,220
I've played Ticodotatogen, but I don't remember that minigame.

166
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:07,300
I'm going to be importing some of the Ticodotatogen.

167
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:11,480
I've played like three different Taiko no Tatujin games thanks to Navi the Papa Music

168
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,480
Horror.

169
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,520
He has like all of them, so I've played a bunch of those.

170
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,320
I don't remember the watermelon eating game.

171
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,360
I remember when it was like- The intro was cracked out.

172
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:23,840
That is one of the queerest movies I've ever seen, the How to Play.

173
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,520
The How to Play was great.

174
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:32,280
The How to Play was like, when the red dot comes, hit the note, boom boom ba doom, boom

175
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,280
boom ba doom.

176
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,160
It's like those little songs that- I'm talking about the intro though.

177
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:42,840
It was cold cracked out, and it made me really have a craving for takoyaki.

178
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:43,840
Takoyaki is yummy.

179
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:50,480
Did it bring out your inner egg, where you're white on the outside, yellow on the inside?

180
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,640
I just want takoyaki, because takoyaki is yummy.

181
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,800
Don't they have takoyaki, Belle?

182
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,800
Die!

183
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:03,000
And by the way, school sucks.

184
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,720
And by the way, school sucks.

185
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,280
Oh, I was just about to ask you?

186
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,280
Sucks my big fat toe.

187
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,780
I was about to get into, uh, you know...

188
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:11,780
Itchy.

189
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:12,780
Itchy toe.

190
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:13,780
Everybody...

191
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:14,780
My rash-covered toe.

192
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:15,780
Is your rash gone?

193
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:16,780
No, it's not gone.

194
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:17,780
I want to see it.

195
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:18,780
Where's...

196
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:19,780
I still have big psoriasis.

197
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:20,780
What happened with the rash?

198
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:21,780
Look at my toe.

199
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:22,780
You'll see scary.

200
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:23,780
And this is a great radio.

201
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:24,780
This is going to look like a...

202
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:27,780
I know, this is a wonderful radio.

203
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:29,340
Okay, now that I see.

204
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:30,340
How did you get a rash?

205
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:34,980
Well, it began with that sinus infection that I was so pissed off at my doctor for not giving

206
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:35,980
me antibiotics for.

207
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:39,500
I want to point out, first of all, Dark Sakura thought she got it from this apartment at

208
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,500
first.

209
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,780
Yeah, because I didn't start itching until I was here doing the show.

210
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:44,780
You're allergic to extrofer.

211
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:45,780
That's basically what it is.

212
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:46,780
I am allergic to gay...

213
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:47,780
Okay.

214
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:48,780
You're allergic to gay people?

215
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:49,780
Is that what you're going to say?

216
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:50,780
Gay people?

217
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:51,780
No.

218
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:52,780
Are you homophobic, ma'am?

219
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:53,780
I'm allergic to your carpet.

220
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:54,780
Your gay carpet.

221
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:56,780
to your carpet.

222
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:58,780
Your gay carpet?

223
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,780
You and I have something in common, honey.

224
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:02,780
I don't like like either!

225
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:04,780
I don't like carpet either!

226
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:06,780
Yay! Anyway.

227
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,780
No, um...

228
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:11,780
No, I can't be allergic to gay because I caught that already.

229
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:12,780
Yeah, yeah.

230
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:14,780
At, uh, Spigle. Five years ago.

231
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,780
How did you catch gay at Spigle?

232
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:19,780
Because, okay, this is an old story.

233
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,780
Do tell.

234
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:29,780
I remember my big Pepsi bong, I got this big, bone-shaped Pepsi drink with a long straw.

235
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:32,780
I don't know if they still sell it at Spigle. I highly doubt it.

236
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:34,780
Spigle, by the way, Sunnyvale, California.

237
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:38,780
And you had just got done playing an intense game of DDR.

238
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:42,780
So you said, here, do you want something to drink? I don't have any diseases.

239
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:46,780
And you say, okay, and take a Spigle drink, and I take it back, and I take my drink, and you go, I have gay.

240
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:49,780
I was like, oh my god, suddenly I want Irene.

241
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:53,280
I remember that.

242
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,280
OK, I remember that now.

243
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,780
Yeah, that was an old story.

244
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:57,280
OK.

245
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,280
But it turned out, well, my doctor,

246
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,780
after two weeks of all these other treatments

247
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:05,780
and I don't get better, we decided it's not viral.

248
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:07,780
So it puts me on amoxicillin, which

249
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:09,280
I've never reacted to before.

250
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,780
I called my mom to make sure before I started taking it, mom,

251
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:13,280
do you have any reactions to amoxicillin?

252
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,780
No, it's just penicillin.

253
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:18,780
And these are the same family, but some people don't have reactions to one that they do to the other.

254
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:22,280
It's like, okay, so I take it, I'm fine, I finish it up last week.

255
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:25,780
And then Sunday, during the middle of the show, I start to itch.

256
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:27,780
Itch, itch, itch. I don't think anything of it.

257
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:31,280
And Monday I'm a little itchy, you know, just a little bit itchier, and then I go to spin,

258
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:35,280
which of course the worst thing you can do when you are having a rash is to exercise,

259
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,780
because you are not supposed to be warm.

260
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:40,280
Spin, by the way, is a class at the gym where you ride a bike a lot.

261
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,280
Yeah.

262
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:41,780
Okay.

263
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:43,780
And different in exciting positions.

264
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:46,760
because the light does not spin around country before that i thought it was

265
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:50,560
just you know what will kids do where they'd never get up and spin kind of

266
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:53,520
but that was the best thing on the playground i think that

267
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,320
you could be it's been a little merry-go-round like put your friends on

268
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,280
it and then you'd like

269
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:01,080
get five people just to spin that thing it's all right and then tell them i

270
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,880
said in the order of uh... like everybody gets so dizzy they throw up

271
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:08,720
it's you know that still fun we need to do or something like the park

272
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,280
we do one of our we need to do one of our podcast at the park

273
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:15,180
on the merry-go-round. As I was saying...

274
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:19,260
Tuesday I have red welts all over my body.

275
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:22,680
I am itching and miserable. Wednesday

276
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:26,700
I call the doctor in the morning and go ahead and schedule my appointment and

277
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:30,760
as the day develops my throat starts closing up. I'm having trouble breathing.

278
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:35,220
I had stomach cramps so bad... You definitely didn't catch Gaye because your throat wouldn't be

279
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:35,960
closing up.

280
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:40,320
Okay, as I was saying

281
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:48,080
I went to eat at the deli that I normally do behind my work, and as I was walking back,

282
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:52,360
my stomach cramps were so bad that I would have to stop because I could not walk, because

283
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:57,960
it hurt to put the pressure on my stomach from the motion of walking.

284
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:03,960
So I went to the doctor, it took a while to narrow down everything because the drugs were

285
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:07,440
the last thing I was thinking of since I never react to drugs, and it turned out it was the

286
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:13,520
amoxicillin had done nothing different and so I'm given beautiful antihistamines

287
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:17,080
which actually don't make me as sleepy as she said they would not like Benadryl

288
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:23,800
which is instant coma and a pill. And this is drug chat with dark Sakura. But

289
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:30,800
and then one of my co-workers who has issues with eczema let me use her

290
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:36,280
prescription for this ointment that made the itch go away. You know I once had an

291
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:39,400
allergic reaction to amoxicillin. It was the first time I was ever on penicillin of any

292
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:42,700
type. I was probably like 12 years old and I don't even remember why I was on amoxicillin.

293
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:46,000
Why do they put people on amoxicillin? Because they have like sinus infections or something?

294
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,100
It's an antibiotic. It's an antibiotic. I love that stuff. It tastes so good. That is

295
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:52,960
gross. It doesn't taste like anything. It's a pill. That's right, because my doctor. Well,

296
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,400
I don't take pills. I can't swallow pills. I just had a sinus infection when I got back

297
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,320
from Pennsylvania like a couple of months ago and the doctor wanted to put me on amoxicillin

298
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:04,760
and I was like, no. Because I get really bad rashes. Like, I had a rash so bad, like it

299
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:09,760
look, my chest was all pink and spotty. It looked like, I don't even know how it said.

300
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:13,880
You didn't know how bad it was at the club. I went in and sat on these couches, and it's

301
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:20,880
under a blacklight. And I'm so very pale that all the places where I was broken out

302
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,320
looked like big black spots. Oh my God.

303
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,920
Because my skin normally glows when I go in the club.

304
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:32,240
To which they went, oh no, she's infected. Someone mentioned that my neck looked like

305
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,740
like it had a continent on it.

306
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,740
Did it say you had the SARS?

307
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,740
Yeah, it was SARS.

308
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:40,740
So besides diseaseful, how was your week?

309
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:43,740
I played lots of games.

310
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:44,740
Like what?

311
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:47,740
I played, I finally opened up my copy of Katamari.

312
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:49,740
Yay, so we can say the K word again.

313
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:50,740
We can say the K word again.

314
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:51,740
Alright, good to hear.

315
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:55,740
And then I played some World of Warcraft.

316
00:24:55,740 --> 00:25:00,740
And thought about asking Dan to buy me DDR and then I thought no.

317
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:03,860
You know, I realized why I can't ever play World of Warcraft.

318
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:08,660
Why? Because everybody I... like a lot of people I know play World of Warcraft, and

319
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:11,580
everybody's trying to get me to sign up and go to their server.

320
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:15,100
The problem is that everybody is on a different server.

321
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:19,100
So if I sign up for that game, I'm going to have to pick a server to go to, and

322
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,780
I'm going to piss people off. No, not necessarily.

323
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:25,580
The... and, and, um, except for having this conversation the other day, when I was

324
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:29,180
showing World of Warcraft, you can have as many characters as you want on as

325
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:32,420
as many servers as you want to and not get charged for it.

326
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:36,900
But I don't like the whole spreading of characters because then you don't have time to focus

327
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,860
and get one really, really uber powerful...

328
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:42,300
But you level so fast. Seriously.

329
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:44,380
Not Guild Wars fast, but fast.

330
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:47,420
I was in an hour of gameplay, I made level 6.

331
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:51,860
You can't do that on Final Fantasy XI, I'm sorry.

332
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:52,820
Not when you first play.

333
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:54,380
Not in an hour of gameplay.

334
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:56,140
Not when you first play.

335
00:25:56,140 --> 00:26:00,620
you have people freaking tanking for you or something, but by yourself. There's ways,

336
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:05,260
but not when you first play. You can run around and not kill anything and at least go up two

337
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:10,900
levels. On World of Warcraft? On World of Warcraft. You find a lake, you get 50 experience

338
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:15,580
points. You find a town, you get 100 experience points. You meet X person, you get 100 experience

339
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:19,740
points. That's retarded. You finish a quest, you get 50, actually it is not for the simple

340
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:26,300
reason it is an RPG if you do tabletop RPG if you do live-action RPG you get

341
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:30,660
experience for doing things and participating in the game not for just

342
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:33,900
going around doing freaking hack and slash which I think is ridiculous you

343
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:41,260
discover you have arms to experience you discovered the secret to lovemaking you

344
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:47,180
just hit puberty thank you grow your first pubes five experience but I like

345
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:54,340
that in the fact that experience is defined by what you do not just what you

346
00:26:54,340 --> 00:27:00,900
kill. Also Jamie. Oh hi. Hello. Take a break from Tycho long enough to say hello. I did.

347
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:07,660
All right. Yo everyone. Are your hands bruised yet? No my hands aren't bruised yet. What I was

348
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:11,700
gonna ask you to tell you to say is what happens when you die on World

349
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:15,680
of Warcraft. Oh yeah you have to go back and find your body. You're a ghost. I do

350
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,680
I do remember seeing that.

351
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,680
Yeah.

352
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,680
Yeah.

353
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:22,000
That's pretty cool because I haven't died yet because I'm awesome.

354
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,440
Now of course, usually when we do little things like that where we just start repeating one

355
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:29,120
thing over and over, gaining experience, our chat room joins in.

356
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,160
I'd like to share some of the little things they've come up with here.

357
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:34,520
We have L. Mullet who, God, I haven't seen him in chat in forever.

358
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,520
Welcome back.

359
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:42,940
L. Mullet says that you lost your virginity, 50 experience points and chlamydia.

360
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:43,940
Got pizza times four.

361
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:51,460
I think that's a reference to the slash pizza command in EverQuest you randomly die six experience you learn what IRC is

362
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:54,340
You guys are weird. All right

363
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:58,140
You know in in real life

364
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:04,180
You know the different things you do add to your experience and teach you along the way and you love a little sometimes

365
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:06,700
You do level when you find things out in real life. I

366
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:10,420
Traumatize me minus

367
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:13,420
Your boyfriend's been fucking around on your back and behind your back.

368
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:19,420
I do like the fact how they have a quest where you can get a chicken pet to follow you around, and the chicken pet's easily killed.

369
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:23,420
So it's a very complex quest for a really useless item.

370
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:29,420
The last quest series of quests that I've been doing, and I'm on the last leg of the series, are the

371
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:32,420
Go to this fountain and fill this bottle and bring it back.

372
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:39,420
And I've done this with five different locations, and now I'm going to the big town to give my bottle to somebody.

373
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:43,360
And I'm, like, kinda underleveled for where I am, because I've just been running quests.

374
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:48,360
I think it would be cooler in World of Warcraft if the chicken that followed you, you could start slashing it, like, over and over,

375
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:53,880
and then all of a sudden, all the chickens start attacking you, and then it says,

376
00:28:53,880 --> 00:29:00,560
and then it says, you got a cock in your ear, fifty experience points, and you got your brains fucked out.

377
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:05,420
Thank you, Xtavor. I like playing the zombies, though, because you can eat people.

378
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:09,420
If you play the undead, you can regain energy by feeding on corpses.

379
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:10,420
That's lovely.

380
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:12,980
So what happens if somebody eats your corpse before you find it?

381
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:14,460
I think it's eating other corpses.

382
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:17,980
I haven't tried doing it yet, because the other good thing about it is that you regenerate

383
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:24,420
XP and you regenerate your MP or energy if you're one of the undead.

384
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:27,500
You got sued by Konami.

385
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:28,500
That's great.

386
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:31,540
You got sued by Konami minus 999 experience.

387
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:38,340
wouldn't it be minus five seven three experience I don't know as I was saying

388
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:45,220
without saying anything all I have to say is that this week something the most

389
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:50,780
hilarious thing is about to happen I can't even put it into words next week

390
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:53,540
you guys is it gonna be done by next Sunday or do we have to wait till we

391
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:58,340
Thursday so is it gonna be done by next Sunday yeah stay tuned on our website

392
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:02,580
We got big news coming up, and next Sunday we're going to have a field day.

393
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:03,580
That's all I have to say.

394
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:06,380
I just find that the other thing that was occurring to me that I also find hilarious

395
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:10,100
about that is just the number of things I'm going to have on display.

396
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,100
I know, I know.

397
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,100
When said person.

398
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:13,100
I know.

399
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:14,100
Anyway, anyway.

400
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,100
No more about that.

401
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:16,100
No more.

402
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:17,100
There's your teaser.

403
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:18,100
I dread.

404
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:19,100
I dread what's going to come of this.

405
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:20,100
I'll be bringing it out.

406
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,100
I dread.

407
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:22,100
Anyway, our listeners are still watching.

408
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:23,100
I don't know.

409
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,100
What the fuck are they talking about?

410
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:30,820
But I'm going to be putting out my pop music controller in my...

411
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:34,500
If the listeners are going to accuse us of jumping the shark ever, next week will be

412
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,500
it.

413
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,500
Oh yeah.

414
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,500
I swear to God, next week will be it.

415
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:38,500
I even find this hilarious.

416
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:39,500
They asked for it.

417
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,500
Anyway.

418
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,900
You should put other, like, Bamani and stuff out.

419
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:43,900
Anyway!

420
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:44,900
Moving on.

421
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:45,900
It'll be around.

422
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:46,900
Loki, how was your week?

423
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:47,900
How was your day?

424
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:49,140
My week was okay.

425
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:50,780
I didn't play that many games.

426
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:57,400
I played Burnout, and more Burnout, and more Burnout. And... So, anyways, my week started

427
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:03,500
off with I had to go to, um... Jury Duty. And, uh...

428
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,740
Oh my God, you went to Jury Duty this week. That's right.

429
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:06,740
Yes. How'd that go?

430
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:11,860
I didn't get called. Instead, I had to watch four movies, um, because they played movies

431
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:16,540
while we were waiting. So, I got to watch Advent Children again on my PSP, and then

432
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:21,500
Then I watched Episode 4 of Star Wars.

433
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:27,060
And then finally, the Pacifier, followed by While You Were Sleeping.

434
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:28,060
Extremely boring.

435
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:33,300
But I got to play Burnout that day on my PSP, so that was fun.

436
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:38,780
And then, other than that, today I played Let's Return Games to GameStop and pre-order

437
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:44,220
Xbox 360 games, so I did that, and I will have to say now I am an ordinary owner of

438
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:48,220
I have one copy of Nintendogs and not three.

439
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:51,220
You're supposed to let me take the doggies.

440
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:53,220
Oh well.

441
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:56,220
So then, wow, what a nice guy.

442
00:31:56,220 --> 00:32:00,220
So I pre-ordered Gun and Project Gotham Racing 3.

443
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:01,220
That's going to be awesome.

444
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:04,220
And what else did I do this week?

445
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:05,220
Eh, not too much.

446
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:09,220
I'm supposed to be getting stylish attire for the...

447
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:18,220
Because I'm going to Lake Tahoe this week for our 25th anniversary party for our company, and I have to wear stylus attire.

448
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:26,220
So I have pinstripe pants, and I have my shirt for it. I'm gonna look pimp. But anyways, what else?

449
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:34,220
Oh, that's pretty much it. You know, just lots of work stuff, and yeah. Some stuff like that.

450
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:35,220
Sounds good.

451
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:43,220
Oh, and right now my stomach feels like it's being eaten by zombies because I just finished, um, a quarter pounder.

452
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:47,220
You know what? Fuck the McDonald's Monopoly game. Fuck it all.

453
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:51,220
It seems like every other month it's like, Monopoly's back!

454
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:59,220
It's like this big excuse to come eat like crap and supersize your meals so you can get, and even though they claim they don't do supersizing anymore, they do.

455
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:00,220
They don't.

456
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:01,220
Yes, they do.

457
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:03,220
They turn the supersize into large.

458
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:04,220
No.

459
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:09,540
large is not as big as supersize. Trust me, I am missing out on potential drink and fries.

460
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:14,100
And you know, they finally switched the cups back to these nice plastic ones that don't

461
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:19,460
fucking blow up when I put them in my cup holder, because that was really fun. But at

462
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:25,700
least they have that fixed now. And what I have to say is now this new Monopoly game

463
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:30,820
you play online as well as collect the stupid pieces. So I've been playing it online and

464
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:37,380
And so far I've won three times the stupid, um, prints at this fish something or other.

465
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:42,500
I don't know, some stupid online, uh, photo place. So now I can get, like, 75 exposures.

466
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:45,940
That's great, except I don't take pictures of anything. So...

467
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:50,220
You should take, like, pornographic pictures of something, or I don't know, like, really

468
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:53,860
raunchy photos, like, take pictures of you and Ellie having sex or something, and see

469
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:54,860
if they'll develop it.

470
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:55,860
They won't develop that crap.

471
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:57,220
You don't know that. Try it.

472
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:58,220
You know that.

473
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:02,220
It'll make a statement.

474
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:07,220
Oh, however, anyways, I'm just trying to win something else.

475
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:12,220
But I do like these Best Buy bucks. That's the only thing I really play it for, is these Best Buy bucks.

476
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:15,220
So I got four dollars from two different fries.

477
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:18,220
But why didn't you just the four dollars that you would have spent on food?

478
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:24,220
I did spend on food. I wanted fries, but I also got fries and free money.

479
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:26,220
Hey, I like free money.

480
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:34,220
Whatever. My week and my day was pretty okay. Yesterday I went to Fry's, which is, you know,

481
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:38,100
nerd heaven. Fry's is this giant electronic store here on the West Coast. I don't think

482
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:42,900
they have it on the East or it's slowly going out there or something. It's also Outpost.com

483
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:47,540
online. And so I went to Fry's and I finally bought myself a gaming router, a wireless

484
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:51,980
gaming router. And what that'll allow me to do is that, since Bug was good enough to give

485
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:57,220
me a wireless router for the computer, because we didn't have a wireless router for the longest

486
00:34:57,220 --> 00:35:01,020
time, but he gave me a wireless router for the computer so I could use the PSP 2.0 browser

487
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:04,340
and I knew the DS thing would be coming out too. And I didn't know they were going to

488
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:08,700
release that dongle thing, the USB that you could plug into the back of your computer

489
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:12,820
so you wouldn't even need a wireless network anyway, but it doesn't matter at this point.

490
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:17,980
But anyway, without having to run a cord to the living room, because the Xbox and Playstation

491
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:23,280
out in the living room, we have the routers in here for the computers, so I don't have

492
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:27,680
a cable long enough, so I had to get a wireless gaming router, basically. It's specifically

493
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:32,500
something you use to plug your Xbox and PlayStation into. So I bought one of those, and it's nice

494
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,780
to be back on Xbox Live and getting killed at Halo.

495
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:41,140
The other thing there, you reminded me about mentioning computer stuff. I got my main computer

496
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:46,540
back, so I can play games now, and that made me happy. Also, I'm working on doing the pop

497
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:50,220
music controller and I went and actually bought the pop music buttons

498
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:53,780
so I have the official arcade buttons so you know and I don't play pop music I

499
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:57,180
hate pop music but for some reason I'm building a pop music controller

500
00:35:57,180 --> 00:36:00,660
oh it reminds me I need to play some pop music stuff next break

501
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:04,800
I have pop music 13 stuff I never got to in a previous week I don't think but anyway

502
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,780
thank you for reminding me

503
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:10,620
uh... what else did I do this week? not a whole lot I guess I started playing

504
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:13,940
extreme 2 online today because since I got the router last night I was

505
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:14,620
playing

506
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:22,860
Extreme 2 online a little bit today. It's interesting. It's better than I thought it

507
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:28,660
would be based on what I had heard early on, the feedback. It was a little bit better done

508
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:32,900
than I thought it would be. But it seems like, I don't know, it feels like halfway finished

509
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:39,840
to me. But I think that more has to do with the fact that UltraMix has a more polished

510
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:43,380
online thing where you can actually choose your opponent and choose your song, which

511
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:47,340
is kind of interesting, but I wonder if that has to do with the fact that Xbox Live is

512
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:52,300
just probably better set up for that kind of thing than the free Playstation things.

513
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:56,540
I have no idea. I don't program these games, I don't know, but the online one, if you guys

514
00:36:56,540 --> 00:37:00,700
have played it, you know that you don't choose your opponent, you just search for an opponent,

515
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:04,520
and you don't get to choose your song. You only get to choose light, standard, heavy,

516
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:12,080
or any. So, it's interesting. And I've played some top ranked players in the time that I've

517
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:16,520
been on there. And what's very interesting about doing that is that, well, A, they've

518
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:21,360
all really, really beat me. But the other interesting thing is that it's randomly picking

519
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:26,320
your song. I've played probably like 15 to 18 matches online total, which really isn't

520
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:29,820
a lot. That's probably about less than an hour of game time. I play like 15 to 18 matches

521
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:36,200
online. Paranoia Survivor Max Heavy has come up three or four times at least. And there's

522
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:39,940
supposed to be like 70 freaking songs in this game. It's picking songs at random. I got

523
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:44,980
paranoia survivor max three or four times out of like like one out of every

524
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:49,300
three matches with paranoia survivor max that's crap that's such crap because

525
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:53,740
paranoia survivor max has bullshit steps if I want to play a song with bullshit

526
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:59,300
steps I'll go play in the groove okay so that's my experience with online

527
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:02,700
otherwise it's okay I mean I did the ranking thing it's it's fun I guess and

528
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:05,760
you know playing matches is okay except you can't really talk to the person

529
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,440
you're playing so you can only imagine what their reaction is like because I

530
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:11,440
know I was playing one kid and he was doing really well and then all of a

531
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:15,480
sudden it like I think he got pissed off that he got a good or something because

532
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:19,500
all of a sudden you just see boo boo boo boo boo and all these you know misses

533
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:23,200
going up his side of the screen so it's kind of funny but you can't really hear

534
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:28,840
them like you can on Xbox so oh darn I know then again kids say really stupid

535
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:33,600
shit on Xbox not so much DDR the DDR rooms are rather decent compared to like

536
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:38,960
like Halo 2 or Doom 3, playing those online, and you got all those kids, like,

537
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:43,960
I'm gonna beat you up, I'm gonna cut you, I'm gonna shoot you, faggot, bla bla bla.

538
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:44,960
That's what playing is.

539
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,960
I do what I want!

540
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:47,960
Exactly.

541
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:51,680
My mom ain't home right now, I got a 40, bla bla bla.

542
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:52,680
I hate kids on explosives.

543
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:56,680
I just stabbed my sister, I'll do what I want!

544
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:57,680
Alright.

545
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,680
Anyway, so that's that.

546
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:02,560
Bugged, how was your week, how was your day?

547
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:07,160
I sold all my DS stuff yesterday and picked up a PSP.

548
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:10,280
And just because, what attracted you to PSP?

549
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,280
The sound worked.

550
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,480
My DS's sound was dead.

551
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:16,480
They didn't ask me when I sold it if it worked or not.

552
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:21,920
That's because anything that doesn't fully function and get sent back for refurbishment.

553
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:22,920
Ahh.

554
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:23,920
Nope.

555
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,440
He didn't say anything about it.

556
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,640
Just because they test them later and if they don't work they send it back to be refurbished.

557
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:29,640
Oh good.

558
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:32,280
I still got my 55 bucks for that.

559
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:35,800
As it turned out, all my stuff was worth the $150, and this is clear back to, like, Pokemon

560
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:36,800
Silver.

561
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:37,800
Wow.

562
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,440
All of my Game Boy stuff.

563
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,440
And Nintendogs.

564
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:45,960
I didn't play it often enough, but PSP I can at least do stuff other than play games on.

565
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:49,580
I think I'm kind of done with Nintendogs, which is kind of sad, because I really, really

566
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:50,580
love that game.

567
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:52,080
I mean, and I remember saying it was like-

568
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,080
It's over far too quick.

569
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:54,080
It's, yeah.

570
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:58,320
I don't, it doesn't hold my interest long enough, and maybe, maybe I'm just trying to

571
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:02,400
to get more of a game out of it, and it's really not supposed to be that. I don't know.

572
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:06,920
I hated that I have to play it. It's just like, I'm like, aw, goddammit, I gotta feed

573
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:10,680
the dog again. I mean, that's not too surprising, because that's how Tamagotchis are, and that's

574
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:14,600
how, you know, other virtual pets. I can't find my DS. Oh, shit. I left it in my locked

575
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:18,880
drawer at work, because I take it to work. Oh, maybe that's it. Maybe, but my puppies

576
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:23,320
are gonna be pissing all over my tatami house. Well, they don't pee on the floor, like they

577
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:28,600
doing like Sims 2 and stuff. Anyway, so anything else?

578
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:32,760
I went down to the Bay Area and ran into random people that we know.

579
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,960
Yeah. I went to Dave & Buster's for dinner and as

580
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:39,460
I was leaving I was like, wow, that really looks like, holy crap, it is. And there's

581
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:44,160
a large, they took out two of the driving games right next to the entrance. What was

582
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:48,200
it, the Namco whatever the hell it was, and the Tokyo Cop.

583
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:50,200
Maximum Tune? Yeah, Maximum Tune.

584
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,200
I'm like Tokyo Cop. Both of those are gone.

585
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:56,200
Yeah, they took out Maximum Tune. It's not in there anymore.

586
00:40:56,200 --> 00:41:00,200
But those two are gone, and there's now a giant six-player trivia game.

587
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,200
Six-player trivia game?

588
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:06,200
Six-player trivia game. You have three buttons, A, B, and C. You just press the button of the answer.

589
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,200
That sounds kind of interesting.

590
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:10,200
It's a ticket game.

591
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:18,200
As I walk up, our other intrepid listener had a pile of tickets running around her feet several times, as per usual.

592
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:20,200
That's great.

593
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:27,200
She bought an Xbox. This is her previous girl, by the way. She's been on the show before, so some of our listeners might know her.

594
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,200
I don't know what she wouldn't buy on here, so...

595
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,200
Sharks Girl.

596
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:36,200
Okay. But she now has $50,000 in one. She came up six short, so I gave her three tickets to put her over $50,000.

597
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,200
What's she buying now?

598
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,200
PS3.

599
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,200
Wow. That's crazy.

600
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:47,200
But that was really strange to just randomly...

601
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:49,200
Run into people?

602
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,200
They run into people?

603
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,200
Randomly run into people.

604
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,720
And I was thinking about actually text messaging her and saying,

605
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:57,160
Hey, are you up for Dave & Buster's Night?

606
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,160
She read your mind.

607
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,160
Apparently so.

608
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:00,160
Amazing.

609
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:01,160
Yep.

610
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:02,160
I want to go check out the trivia game.

611
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,520
Although I am sad about Tokyo Cop.

612
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,520
Don't be.

613
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:05,520
I like Tokyo Cop.

614
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:06,520
Sucked.

615
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:07,520
Tokyo Cop was really awful.

616
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:08,520
You bastards.

617
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:13,360
If it's the same game I'm thinking of, it's like right there when you walk through

618
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:14,360
the door, it's right there on the right.

619
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,360
Yeah, it drove the little crazy heart.

620
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:16,720
I like Tokyo Cop.

621
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:17,720
Nobody else did.

622
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:22,720
You know what they need to get anywhere because they're releasing it over here is the Mario Kart arcade game.

623
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:25,720
Holy God do I want to play that so bad.

624
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:27,720
But that's geared towards kids.

625
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:28,720
No it's not.

626
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,720
No, I don't care. I'll kick the kids out.

627
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:34,720
All they have to do is put something you can hold your beer in.

628
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:35,720
Exactly.

629
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:38,720
I'll tell you what, that F-Zero arcade game kicked ass.

630
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:41,720
The only problem with F-Zero arcade game is that there was like three tracks.

631
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:42,720
Four.

632
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:43,720
Yeah, like four tracks.

633
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:49,880
An F-Zero arcade game could have been amazing if they put more tracks on it, and like more

634
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:50,880
to do.

635
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:53,640
It wasn't so damn expected, but the F-Zero arcade game was awesome.

636
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:54,640
I liked it.

637
00:42:54,640 --> 00:43:00,500
Well, the nice thing about going to Dave & Buster's for dinner and stuff, they had the $13.99

638
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:01,900
get a $10 card.

639
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:06,920
Now it's $14.99 all day, Monday through Thursday.

640
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:10,240
By the way, secret message from our chat room.

641
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:11,240
Poland, Poland!

642
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:12,240
Poland, yes.

643
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:19,280
There you go. She's psychic! Shark's girl just hopped in chat and said Poland, Poland!

644
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:22,640
She's probably listening. I think so.

645
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,720
She claims to. Her boyfriend was in chat earlier, so I think

646
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:27,320
they're both listening. It looks that way.

647
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:29,800
Yes. Poland. Definitely Poland.

648
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:32,960
Is that like a trivia question thing or something? Yeah, everyone else answered right, because

649
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:36,920
it was pretty obvious. And, well, she didn't.

650
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:40,920
Alright, anyway. I don't even remember the whole question.

651
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:42,920
It was something about Poland.

652
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:43,920
No, it wasn't about Poland.

653
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:44,920
No, it wasn't about Poland.

654
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:46,920
It was about somebody being from a certain country,

655
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:48,920
and one of the choices was Poland,

656
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:50,920
but the right answer was something completely odd.

657
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:53,920
I want to try this game out sometime.

658
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,920
I'm going to have to go back to Dave & Buster's.

659
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,920
I wish they'd build one here.

660
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:59,920
I love the idea of a Chuck E. Cheese for adults,

661
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,920
where kids aren't allowed after a certain time.

662
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:02,920
That's like heaven to me.

663
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:04,920
I don't think they should be allowed at all.

664
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:08,920
In heaven, I don't want children to be allowed after 11 o'clock.

665
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:11,420
If you could if you could just beat them up and kick them out of the way

666
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:16,000
Yeah, kind of like how in Katamari when you hold down the button and run you can bump the cousins out exactly

667
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Yeah, that would be perfect for kids at night

668
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,880
because drunken rages are just like

669
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,760
X2 four hours your week. How was your day?

670
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:31,740
It's pretty much your usual week for me. I like went to work, you know

671
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:35,400
Played music at home

672
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:42,280
home, showered, shaved, masturbated more than a few times.

673
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:48,840
And also, you know, on Fridays, Fridays have officially been dubbed Firefly Fridays.

674
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:54,320
And so Jamie and I, or DarkSakra and I have- I prefer my name.

675
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:55,320
Okay.

676
00:44:55,320 --> 00:45:00,420
Jamie and I went ahead and we went ahead and watched up to the end of the second

677
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:03,300
Disc of Firefly, which was great, good times.

678
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:05,300
The J-Town episode.

679
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:07,940
Yeah, it's pretty funny.

680
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:08,940
Pretty funny stuff.

681
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:09,940
Still recommend the movie.

682
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:10,940
A hero called me.

683
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:11,940
That was great.

684
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:12,940
Okay, sorry.

685
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:17,340
So, anyhow, we went and saw...

686
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:23,860
We saw that at our place, and then we also went to Lions, where I got to explain why

687
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:29,460
Pez candy is like the sheepskin condom of candy.

688
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:34,460
Oh, you want to know why? Oh, okay.

689
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:38,300
Probably not, but okay. Because sheepskin condoms are like the classic

690
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:45,820
that nobody really thinks about now. And so are PEZ candies.

691
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:49,460
PEZ candies go in those now? They just may.

692
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:55,900
You know a sheepskin condom PEZ candy dispenser? That might be something to talk about.

693
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:59,380
Just move on, please. So that would make the PEZ condiments, right?

694
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:06,980
So anyways, that was my week.

695
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:09,820
As for yesterday, it wasn't that great.

696
00:46:09,820 --> 00:46:14,340
It was kind of one of those dramatic family days.

697
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:21,820
I did end up seeing a movie that I'll probably talk about later on, but otherwise that's

698
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:22,820
really all.

699
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:26,820
Today I bought Taiko Drum Master because I've been kind of... Oh, that's another thing

700
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:30,740
thing that Jamie and I did on Friday night was I got to play her taiko drum master, which

701
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:34,940
is so much funner with two people that it's still fun as with one person.

702
00:46:34,940 --> 00:46:35,940
Funner.

703
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:36,940
Funner.

704
00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:38,460
Yeah, funner is the new word of the day.

705
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:39,460
So much more fun.

706
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:40,460
Whatever.

707
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:41,460
Fuck you.

708
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:42,460
Smartass.

709
00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:49,160
So anyways, that's how the week was.

710
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:53,440
You know, I seem to remember that when we moved in together and you're going to be the

711
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:56,300
roommate and everything, you didn't really like video games an awful lot.

712
00:46:56,300 --> 00:47:00,140
Like, you had a few GameCube games. You liked Metroid, you liked Donkey Konga.

713
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:02,740
Now you're running out to GameStop. I gotta get Tycho Drum Master!

714
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:05,620
Well, I mean, Tycho Drum Master's like Donkey Konga.

715
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:11,220
It's a hell of a lot better than Donkey Konga. It's great, but, you know.

716
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:16,140
I'm fairly... I'm not so much bad with the video game stuff.

717
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:20,340
I can get into stuff. I used to be into it when I was little.

718
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:24,260
You know, I played the Mario Brothers. Thank you.

719
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:26,260
Oh, no problem for that.

720
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:27,260
All right.

721
00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:30,260
We're going to go to a quick break, boys and girls, when we come back.

722
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:32,260
Maybe we'll do some Bahmani news if there's anything going on.

723
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:35,260
I don't know. I have to look. It's been a long week.

724
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:39,260
And we'll also get into the Cave Match tonight at some point.

725
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:40,260
EFUs of the Week.

726
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:41,260
Oh, I want to talk about this, too.

727
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:43,260
Listen to our podcast this week, boys and girls,

728
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:46,260

729
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:51,260
We're giving away Death Jr. and Coded Arms on this week's podcast.

730
00:47:51,260 --> 00:47:52,260
Isn't that lovely?

00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:56,260

734
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:08,260
to remind me we haven't done some of this music yet. We're going to hear a brand new

735
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:12,260
Sota Fujimori song starting us off with Spring Come Around.

00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:54,280
Then nay nay nay nay nay nay

741
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:58,980
Then nay nay nay nay nay nay

742
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:05,320
Then nay nay nay nay nay nay

00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:10,560
Then nay nay nay nay nay nay

744
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:42,560
Oh

745
00:52:40,560 --> 00:53:08,560
It's just a matter of time, it goes by, it's all a matter of time The moment may have sealed me alive, but I can forget the moment

746
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:13,560
If I don't get what I was hoping to show to you yet

747
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:18,560
I wish I had a girl my girl would swear I could

748
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:21,560
With no faith, or running, or running

749
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:23,560
She could play her life without me

750
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:26,560
If I was to change, and it could rise

751
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:29,560
But I can't take it to be real, I think

752
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:31,560
If the sun doesn't fly, I won't lose

753
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:33,560
I can't get back to you

754
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:37,560
I don't know what it's gonna be if we didn't show

755
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:39,560
She could think of no light

756
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:42,560
Looking for the pain inside your face

757
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:44,560
These memories come all the same

758
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:46,560
You say you love me

759
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:47,560
I would know well

760
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:50,920
Well, you was out here for me, wasn't it?

761
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:28,600
After this song, we'll be having a Let Them Move marathon.

762
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:29,600
Noooooo!

763
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:36,200
Just kidding, Orange Lounge Radio, crap-free Bhavani radio.

764
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:40,280
We're back here on Orange Lounge Radio, that was some music from Popin' Music 13, I think

765
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:42,920
they're calling that Carnival, is the subtitle of that.

766
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:47,180
I haven't followed Popin' Music in a little while, sorry kids, but they don't really have

767
00:56:47,180 --> 00:56:49,280
an arcade machine exactly around the corner

768
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:52,040
uh... sort of which you more it was spring comes around the little eight

769
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:53,800
that selling side i cannot actually

770
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:56,800
it's almost eight that's only what it sounds like an old carter sixty-four

771
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:59,400
game i kinda dig this track

772
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:03,740
that site on a with opportunity and uh... deejay taco with moon in there as

773
00:57:03,740 --> 00:57:05,600
well featuring erica

774
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:06,780
mochi suki

775
00:57:06,780 --> 00:57:10,680
and then does row is the last one there in the track is called

776
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:13,720
uh... some japanese text after that i can read because it's all garbled on my

777
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:16,720
computer anyway so son something

778
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:19,720
And a lot of folks in the chat room are saying,

779
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:20,720
Hey, it's Daikin Kai!

780
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:21,720
Well, yeah, it's Desero.

781
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:22,720
You know what I miss?

782
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:23,720
What?

783
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:26,480
I sort of miss letting them move.

784
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:29,080
I don't think I have that anywhere.

785
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:31,440
I used to let them move the cow thing.

786
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:33,840
Yeah, let them move the cow mix.

787
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:34,840
I have that somewhere.

788
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:37,960
I'll have to find that.

789
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:40,400
You know what's interesting is really not a whole lot going on in the music

790
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:42,580
game scene right now going on.

791
00:57:42,580 --> 00:57:46,180
So God, we're screwed when it comes to a show tonight.

792
00:57:46,180 --> 00:57:50,340
So I guess we have to talk about some other things that are going on in the gaming world.

793
00:57:50,340 --> 00:57:55,780
So one thing that's kind of been brought up time and time again is the Xbox 360, of course

794
00:57:55,780 --> 00:57:58,060
the release dates right around the corner.

795
00:57:58,060 --> 00:58:03,340
And some folks are kind of wondering, what's so great about the Xbox 360?

796
00:58:03,340 --> 00:58:06,840
Should I be going out and picking up one of these Xbox 360s at launch?

797
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:08,160
Should I wait?

798
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:09,680
What games are actually going to be released?

799
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:13,340
And boy, it seems like that launch list of Xbox 360 titles is getting shorter and shorter,

800
00:58:13,340 --> 00:58:14,340
doesn't it?

801
00:58:14,340 --> 00:58:15,340
Yep.

802
00:58:15,340 --> 00:58:19,340
What moved now? Wasn't it Project Gotham Racing, was it?

803
00:58:19,340 --> 00:58:22,340
No, Project Gotham is still there. That's the launch title.

804
00:58:22,340 --> 00:58:25,340
Microsoft's already guaranteed that's going to launch.

805
00:58:25,340 --> 00:58:30,340
That cameo and Perfect Dark Zero are guaranteed to launch.

806
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:34,340
In fact, they actually pushed them up a week, so now they're coming out November 10th.

807
00:58:34,340 --> 00:58:39,340
Anyways, what did move, though, was Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter,

808
00:58:39,340 --> 00:58:42,340
one of the really cool squad-based first-version shooters that was coming out.

809
00:58:42,340 --> 00:58:52,340
That got pushed all the way back to February, and before that was Framed City Killer put out by Namco, which also got pushed back to February for more tweaking.

810
00:58:52,340 --> 00:58:57,340
I think Ghost Recon, what they're trying to do is finish the 360 stuff so they can launch them all at once.

811
00:58:57,340 --> 00:59:03,340
So that basically eliminated what I was going to try to bring in as one of the first games.

812
00:59:03,340 --> 00:59:07,340
I have a pre-booked gun, which is, you know, Grand Theft Auto and the Wild West,

813
00:59:07,340 --> 00:59:12,540
and then, um, Project Optum 3, which looks amazing from what I've seen in the gameplay footage.

814
00:59:12,540 --> 00:59:16,460
Plus, it has a minigame in it, um, Geometry Wars 2, which looks pretty cool.

815
00:59:16,460 --> 00:59:19,860
Yeah, what the hell is this about the minigame that's in it? Isn't it, like, uh,

816
00:59:19,860 --> 00:59:22,860
frickin', you said it was, like, by the people that did Rez, and...

817
00:59:22,860 --> 00:59:26,700
Well, it's not by the people that did Rez. I said it looks like a cross between Asteroids,

818
00:59:26,700 --> 00:59:32,860
Rez... I got really excited for a minute, and I was like, oh my god, because Rez is one of those titles that was so sexy, and it was, like, completely overlooked.

819
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:37,580
It is, it looks pretty cool, and apparently Geometry Wars 1 was available as a hidden

820
00:59:37,580 --> 00:59:42,740
game in Project Gotham 2, so you can actually try that out, but what they're doing with

821
00:59:42,740 --> 00:59:49,100
the 360 is they're actually promoting a kind of a homebrew community actually, so you can

822
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:54,620
have your games developed and put them on this Xbox Live Arcade, is what they're calling

823
00:59:54,620 --> 00:59:56,620
it, so you can download these mini games.

824
00:59:56,620 --> 01:00:00,420
So one of them, and it's actually included with the hard drive, which is retarded, but

825
01:00:00,420 --> 01:00:05,440
is this Hectics, which is created by the guy that did Tetris, and it's kind of a new puzzle

826
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:09,540
game. Then there's another one that they showed, which is like a Marble Madness type game called

827
01:00:09,540 --> 01:00:14,300
Marble Blast. But then this game, though, is going to be coming with Project Gotham

828
01:00:14,300 --> 01:00:19,500
3, and I've seen gameplay footage of it. I was trying to bring some up to show you guys

829
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:25,700
in the studio, but it looks amazing. And I don't know, I think it'd be a perfect PSP

830
01:00:25,700 --> 01:00:26,700
game.

831
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:32,260
I'm worried about all these titles pushing back. It's kinda like Microsoft really, really

832
01:00:32,260 --> 01:00:35,840
wants the system out this Christmas, come hell. Well, and at this point, they can't

833
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:39,080
push back. They really can't. I mean, they'll piss off America if they push the system back

834
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:40,640
any further. Well, they're not gonna push the system.

835
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:43,760
These games, though, at launch... But what's the point of buying the system

836
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:47,160
if there's no games available at launch? There's gonna be, like, 20-some games.

837
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:51,940
I know, but nothing that I really want. Well, what are you looking for? I mean, they've

838
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:55,280
got stuff... If you're a sports fan, they have tons of sports coming out.

839
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:59,660
I'm not much of a sports guitar. I haven't really liked a sports game since, like, Tecmo

840
01:00:59,660 --> 01:01:00,660
Bowl, okay?

841
01:01:00,660 --> 01:01:01,660
Yeah.

842
01:01:01,660 --> 01:01:05,300
And by the way, I picked up that Tecmo collection. I'm going to talk about this again on the

843
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:09,100
podcast, but that Tecmo collection, I picked it up for Xbox, and it has the arcade game

844
01:01:09,100 --> 01:01:14,620
version of Tecmo Bowl on it. So not what I remember. The NES version was so much more

845
01:01:14,620 --> 01:01:17,020
fluid and fun. Anyway, sorry.

846
01:01:17,020 --> 01:01:23,560
Anyways, for the 360, if you like sports, definitely going to be a system for you. If

847
01:01:23,560 --> 01:01:28,280
We want racing games. There's going to be a lot of stuff. Project Gotham, Ridge Racer,

848
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:32,080
Need for Speed, Most Wanted. Those are going to be three big ones.

849
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:37,400
Carmageddon? No, Carmageddon. Full Auto. Full Auto coming out next year. That one is

850
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:42,160
exciting. Put out by Sega. It's like a cross between Twisted Metal and Burnout. And all

851
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:46,600
I have to do is mention Burnout. Basically, giant, you know, cars with guns on them, shooting

852
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:51,160
each other. You can blow up buildings. Okay, like Spy Hunter on crack. Yeah. Okay, cool.

853
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:55,280
Yeah, it's going to be freaking awesome. But anyways, on the end of that one...

854
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:59,660
That was the Xbox. That was the problem I had with the Xbox, because it's no secret

855
01:01:59,660 --> 01:02:03,760
that on this program, because this program's been on long enough, where when we were first

856
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:07,520
starting this program, PlayStation 2 was kind of new still, and Xbox was just on its way

857
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:12,640
out, and I said, there's no effing way I'm ever going to buy an Xbox, because all the

858
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:18,640
Xbox is is sports games, racers... I had an acronym for it.

859
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:25,640
It's Sarsy Games. That's it. It's Sars Games. It's Sports, Action, Racing, Shooters.

860
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:29,640
Yeah, that's pretty much everything that comes out nowadays, though.

861
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:31,640
I guess because that's what sells, but...

862
01:02:31,640 --> 01:02:37,640
Well, let's put it this way. Okay, RPGs. You've got Cameo, which is sort of an RPG.

863
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:39,640
That's really pushing it, but...

864
01:02:39,640 --> 01:02:40,640
Right.

865
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:45,640
And Elder Scrolls, which is just a hardcore RPG.

866
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:54,640
Then also, what else we have here? There's Quake 4 for your first-person shooter fans.

867
01:02:54,640 --> 01:03:04,640
Which I have to admit is something I'm highly interested in. I do like the rare first-person shooter game. I love Halo, for one, that's for sure.

868
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:11,640
And then, for your non-mainstream stuff, they've got Tony Hawk's American Wasteland, Gun, which

869
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:17,840
is going to be coming out, King Kong, they'll be coming out right afterwards, and then there's

870
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:21,600
a dead spill of nothing until about January, I think.

871
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:22,600
Interesting.

872
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:24,560
And then that's when there's some more games coming out.

873
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:26,920
But of course, more stuff will be announced as we get closer.

874
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:30,020
Is it going to be like the DS launch, where they kind of blow their load when the system

875
01:03:30,020 --> 01:03:35,420
first comes out, and then you go through this like, and PSP, oh my god, the PSP. PSP totally

876
01:03:35,420 --> 01:03:38,140
blew its logo when it first came out, and then six months of nothing.

877
01:03:38,140 --> 01:03:42,180
Well, look at this way. December is a dead month as far as games coming out anyways for

878
01:03:42,180 --> 01:03:47,060
all systems. It's just, they push stuff out of, you know, December, and there's like twelve

879
01:03:47,060 --> 01:03:52,460
games. Total. I mean, that's it. Um, whereas November, two hundred games. You know, it's

880
01:03:52,460 --> 01:03:55,040
just pretty good. Well, that makes sense though, because everybody's

881
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:58,340
trying to get on the Christmas bandwagon, because all the Christmas shopping starts

882
01:03:58,340 --> 01:04:02,220
the day after Thanksgiving. And I'll be damned if there aren't people to get all of their

883
01:04:02,220 --> 01:04:03,620
shopping done the day after Thanksgiving.

884
01:04:03,620 --> 01:04:07,980
Some of us actually get started in mid-year.

885
01:04:07,980 --> 01:04:12,180
And some of us wait until Christmas Eve Eve to do it. That's me. December 23rd. Every

886
01:04:12,180 --> 01:04:15,060
year I do my Christmas shopping.

887
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:18,980
So the other games, the ones I was going to pick up and launch Project Gotham looks just

888
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:22,940
like really amazing. And Ridge Racer wasn't too impressed with because it just looks like

889
01:04:22,940 --> 01:04:26,780
Ridge Racer. I mean, they haven't really done anything with it. It has the same damn tracks

890
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:31,540
in it for one, whereas Project Awesome is so fully realistic. They actually have texturing

891
01:04:31,540 --> 01:04:36,660
on the glass on the windshield of the car. You can see smudge prints on there. I mean,

892
01:04:36,660 --> 01:04:38,020
that's how realistic this thing is.

893
01:04:38,020 --> 01:04:39,020
Bloodstains?

894
01:04:39,020 --> 01:04:47,860
No, but I'm hoping. I wish, but no. Just really amazing stuff. Quake 4 is going to be awesome.

895
01:04:47,860 --> 01:04:51,460
Gun is just, I don't even know what gun's going to be. Gun's going to be phenomenal.

896
01:04:51,460 --> 01:04:54,640
And then, I don't know, I might pick up one more game.

897
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:59,640
Sixty bucks for these games. I was looking at EB Games, they have a whole big display trying to get people to pre-order this stuff.

898
01:04:59,640 --> 01:05:00,640
Sixty-four after tax.

899
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:02,640
Sixty bucks a game.

900
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:03,640
Yeah.

901
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:04,640
Crazy.

902
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:08,640
It's lame, but everything I buy is on store credit.

903
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:10,640
Right, right.

904
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:13,640
Yeah. But, um...

905
01:05:13,640 --> 01:05:21,640
So a lot of people, you know, we have a lot of younger listeners that listen to this program who don't hold down full-time jobs, so they can't exactly run out and buy a system.

906
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:31,640
And please don't get us wrong either. I mean, yes, I have a full time job, but it's hard for me to go out and buy these systems. If gaming wasn't like a huge hobby of mine, I wouldn't be.

907
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:40,640
And that's probably the only reason I'm going to buy a 360 on launch is because I feel like I have to to stay on top of what's going on in the industry for the podcast.

908
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:45,640
Well, here's what I'm saying here. Don't go out and buy the system if you're unsure if you want it or not.

909
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:55,640
The only reason I'm buying one, same reason I bought PSP close to launch, same reason I bought DS, is because I'm a gaming whore and I'll have to, you know, pick this stuff up for two reasons.

910
01:05:55,640 --> 01:06:02,640
One, to stay on, to have an edge at work, you know, the game sale stuff I do, and just an edge on everything.

911
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:12,640
And then also just because I have to get everything, even though, you know, I may not play it like my GameCube, you know, but, um, it just, there's a lot of stuff coming out.

912
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:18,380
If you have a PSP, definitely pick one of those up. DS? Tons of stuff for Internet,

913
01:06:18,380 --> 01:06:19,380
you know?

914
01:06:19,380 --> 01:06:21,120
Oh, I'm so excited about DS Internet.

915
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:23,920
I'm going to have them all anyway.

916
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:27,000
I was going to kind of ask you about this because you're kind of a systems whore. You

917
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:30,720
make no secret about that. You own, like, is there any system that's ever been released

918
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:31,720
that you do not own?

919
01:06:31,720 --> 01:06:35,680
I don't have a CDI. I don't have a Sarah Child Channel app, although Dan has owned one.

920
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:36,680
Do you have a 3DO?

921
01:06:36,680 --> 01:06:37,680
No.

922
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:38,680
Okay.

923
01:06:38,680 --> 01:06:39,680
Don't want a 3DO.

924
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:40,680
Yeah, I know. Who wants a 3DO?

925
01:06:40,680 --> 01:06:44,680
Is there any game on the 3DO that makes that system worth buying? A 1?

926
01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:48,680
What do I have? I have a Neo Geo, I have a Neo Geo CD.

927
01:06:48,680 --> 01:06:51,680
If we ask what you do have, it's going to take you all there.

928
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:56,680
Yeah, but what I don't have also could take me a lot. The thing that's at the top of my list of what I want right now,

929
01:06:56,680 --> 01:07:02,680
realistically, is a Duo RX. PC Engine Duo RX.

930
01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:04,680
Okay, so we know you're going to get a 360 at launch.

931
01:07:04,680 --> 01:07:07,680
I'm actually wanting the PS3 more.

932
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:13,600
There's also the fact that your husband works at GameStop, so you also in your household

933
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:17,160
kind of have a need to stay on top of what's going on in the gaming world, right?

934
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:20,800
With you doing the radio and him doing the selling of the items in the store.

935
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:25,180
We're gonna have all that, and on top of that, any game that comes out, he can basically

936
01:07:25,180 --> 01:07:26,180
check it out of the store.

937
01:07:26,180 --> 01:07:29,840
He can play it all we want to and put it back.

938
01:07:29,840 --> 01:07:30,840
That's cool.

939
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:31,840
Not a big deal.

940
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:34,040
But you say you're more excited about PS3.

941
01:07:34,040 --> 01:07:35,040
Yeah.

942
01:07:35,040 --> 01:07:36,600
Why?

943
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:42,560
studied a bit more on the cell processor myself prior to seeing the demo at E3

944
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:49,400
and that knowing that there's going to be a new Tekken oh my god and other

945
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:55,480
things that I'm more than positive will be out based on things that I've seen

946
01:07:55,480 --> 01:08:01,400
the Final Fantasy remake the the which I know is still just a rumor but I'm

947
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:08,400
convinced it's happening. What was the other thing? The, god damn it, racing game that's

948
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:10,800
incredibly, Gran Turismo, thank you, Gran Turismo.

949
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:17,240
I'm not as excited about Gran Turismo but Dan is. Just knowing that, and on top of that,

950
01:08:17,240 --> 01:08:24,680
I really, really hope that people, see, the PlayStation 2 I think would have been better

951
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:30,600
had people been more skilled in programming games for it because they didn't, there wasn't

952
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:36,300
a lot of I wouldn't say very good use of the channels hence the jaggedy games you

953
01:08:36,300 --> 01:08:40,600
know like oh let's put in surround sound but not you know make the game look nice

954
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:49,160
hello and you know and me I always go for the underdog system myself in you

955
01:08:49,160 --> 01:08:53,280
know I said I would normally put me on the boat with the revolution however I

956
01:08:53,280 --> 01:08:59,100
think that the controller is retarded so and the Xbox games I'm really not too

957
01:08:59,100 --> 01:09:03,380
you excited about anything coming out on 360? I can't knock the Nintendo controller though

958
01:09:03,380 --> 01:09:08,980
until I get to touch it and play a game and see how it really feels. Racing games, yay.

959
01:09:08,980 --> 01:09:14,260
Sports games, yay. And that's, to bring it full circle, that's how I felt about the Xbox

960
01:09:14,260 --> 01:09:17,540
when it first came out, and then sure enough, I got to play it. Well I know that all that's

961
01:09:17,540 --> 01:09:21,580
going to end up in my house is Project Gotham, and I'm like, I'm tired of damn playing Need

962
01:09:21,580 --> 01:09:25,860
for Speed Underground 2 all the damn time. He'll bring in Need for Speed Most Wanted

963
01:09:25,860 --> 01:09:32,900
than Underground 3. Goody-goody. Yay! Oh, gee, you know. Finally, I caved and I bought

964
01:09:32,900 --> 01:09:37,740
an Xbox when Halo, I finally got to play Halo for the first time and I was like, wow, this

965
01:09:37,740 --> 01:09:42,700
is a shooter I actually really enjoy. And Halo 2, of course, the DDR on Xbox, which

966
01:09:42,700 --> 01:09:49,780
I still believe the UltraMix 2 is the best DDR game they put out, period. And there's

967
01:09:49,780 --> 01:09:55,060
another Fable I actually kind of enjoy a little bit. And all that, you know, is on Xbox. And

968
01:09:55,060 --> 01:09:59,900
And so Xbox finally kind of grew out of the SARS games for me.

969
01:09:59,900 --> 01:10:05,180
On top of that, I'm probably going to be getting an import PS3 as well, because I know that

970
01:10:05,180 --> 01:10:09,900
there are going to be more games coming out overseas on the PS3 than there will be on

971
01:10:09,900 --> 01:10:11,420
the Xbox 360.

972
01:10:11,420 --> 01:10:12,420
I want to bring this up.

973
01:10:12,420 --> 01:10:15,540
I've been wanting to bring this topic up on the show for like two weeks, and now it just

974
01:10:15,540 --> 01:10:16,540
hit me.

975
01:10:16,540 --> 01:10:20,700
You saying this reminded me to bring this up.

976
01:10:20,700 --> 01:10:23,820
Obviously we've been to E3, so we've talked to a lot of people in the industry, and we

977
01:10:23,820 --> 01:10:27,540
we continue to talk to some of those people. And I was having a very interesting conversation

978
01:10:27,540 --> 01:10:31,700
with somebody who works in the industry, not that long ago, and this person was saying

979
01:10:31,700 --> 01:10:39,100
that there was a game that the company wanted to bring out that had a lot of hype going

980
01:10:39,100 --> 01:10:44,660
forward in Japan, I think. The game, you know, was something that some people in Japan are

981
01:10:44,660 --> 01:10:50,940
looking forward to, and they wanted to bring it out here. But I guess Sony gets some type

982
01:10:50,940 --> 01:10:55,220
of approval over what games actually come out for the system, and Sony rejected the

983
01:10:55,220 --> 01:11:02,220
game, saying it's too Japanese. That's stupid. And I'm thinking, what? You rejected a game

984
01:11:02,220 --> 01:11:07,500
because it's too Japanese? And then my second thought is, how in the fuck did Katamari Damacy

985
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:14,260
ever come out in this country? Even better, why did it sell better here than there? Which

986
01:11:14,260 --> 01:11:19,860
is true. I, I, that boggled my mind. From what I understand the game cut even in Japan,

987
01:11:19,860 --> 01:11:24,440
here it's like oversold no one likes Japanese stuff I mean that's why you

988
01:11:24,440 --> 01:11:30,760
know all you see all these networks like g4 TV oh I don't know you know cartoon

989
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:36,280
network all this stuff you know they're of course not playing any anime of any

990
01:11:36,280 --> 01:11:40,920
sort whatsoever so obviously no one likes the Japanese culture at all I mean

991
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:44,120
that's why you don't see people out there you know buying anime from their

992
01:11:44,120 --> 01:11:48,360
GameStop or you know buying all these anime games that come out because

993
01:11:48,360 --> 01:11:51,120
There's no interest whatsoever in anime at all.

994
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:55,000
And I can see where maybe Sony wants some type of quality control over the games, but

995
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:58,280
then I think, my God, why did Driver 3 come out?

996
01:11:58,280 --> 01:12:04,560
All they need, all that they need, well actually Sony right now is hiring for localization,

997
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:09,560
for localization people, which leads me to think that, you know, I was taking that as

998
01:12:09,560 --> 01:12:13,600
a positive sign for a little while, hoping that they were saying, hey, you know, these

999
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:17,600
import games are, are, you know, doing really big in the States.

1000
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:20,760
They've got a big, you know, how else did we get DDR here?

1001
01:12:20,760 --> 01:12:25,120
What? I don't understand... That's also a good question, and now BeatMania on its way out too.

1002
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:29,200
I understand how they could reject a game because it's too Japanese anyways. So if the game's too Japanese,

1003
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:33,680
then it won't sell, then that company won't make any money. At least it's not crap, so it's not,

1004
01:12:33,680 --> 01:12:36,760
you know, gonna make your system look bad. I don't get it.

1005
01:12:36,760 --> 01:12:42,360
It should really take DDR as the example, you know. How many people think, oh, dancing aim, you know, too

1006
01:12:42,360 --> 01:12:43,440
Japanese for the

1007
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:48,080
the United States, but we have our friend at Konami who kept pushing and pushing and

1008
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:49,080
pushing and...

1009
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:50,080
Mr. Enos.

1010
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:51,080
Exactly.

1011
01:12:51,080 --> 01:12:52,080
Absolutely.

1012
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:56,640
And lo and behold, we have DDR now, and we also have cheap knock-offs.

1013
01:12:56,640 --> 01:13:01,640
Well, an interesting follow-up to that is that the same person said that since that

1014
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:07,300
game's not going to come out here for the PlayStation now, that a different form...

1015
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:10,820
I obviously really don't want to give this away because of the nature of the story, but

1016
01:13:10,820 --> 01:13:16,820
a different type of game in the series will be coming out on Xbox, on a Microsoft console.

1017
01:13:16,820 --> 01:13:21,060
I don't remember if it was Xbox or Xbox 360, so it's going to come out on a Microsoft console.

1018
01:13:21,060 --> 01:13:23,260
Because Microsoft apparently does not really give a shit.

1019
01:13:23,260 --> 01:13:25,940
They're just excited to have people putting games out on their system.

1020
01:13:25,940 --> 01:13:28,480
And I was kind of like, wow, that's kind of a...

1021
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:33,220
I understand the need to have quality control over your system, but some real shit comes

1022
01:13:33,220 --> 01:13:34,220
out for those systems.

1023
01:13:34,220 --> 01:13:35,220
I mean, really.

1024
01:13:35,220 --> 01:13:36,220
Really.

1025
01:13:36,220 --> 01:13:39,140
The chaff.

1026
01:13:39,140 --> 01:13:42,900
Have you seen some of those budget titles they have now for PlayStation 1?

1027
01:13:42,900 --> 01:13:45,580
Maybe they let those come out because they don't care anymore?

1028
01:13:45,580 --> 01:13:48,020
Like the five and ten dollar Walmart games?

1029
01:13:48,020 --> 01:13:57,700
The Texas Hold'em 50,000 incarnation of the PopCap games?

1030
01:13:57,700 --> 01:14:03,300
Things you can play for free on the internet on Flash coming out for Game Boy Advance and

1031
01:14:03,300 --> 01:14:04,300
PlayStation.

1032
01:14:04,300 --> 01:14:05,300
Bejeweled again!

1033
01:14:05,300 --> 01:14:11,580
Snood came out on the Game Boy Advance, if you'll recall, which is, I think, a cheaper

1034
01:14:11,580 --> 01:14:14,080
problem for us to move.

1035
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:15,080
Interesting comment in the chat room.

1036
01:14:15,080 --> 01:14:19,580
A float walk is in there saying, Katamari sells, because getting high and tripping out

1037
01:14:19,580 --> 01:14:20,580
are universal.

1038
01:14:20,580 --> 01:14:23,380
Yeah, I just get motion sick.

1039
01:14:23,380 --> 01:14:24,380
Very interesting feedback there.

1040
01:14:24,380 --> 01:14:28,460
Of course, our chat room, once again, www.orangeloungeradio.com.

1044
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:42,640
click on interact with us and the skype line it's open right now. So if you want to call

1045
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:47,460
in we're opening that up. Not a whole lot of people signed into skype tonight so I'm

1046
01:14:47,460 --> 01:14:51,640
thinking maybe we're going to have a dry night of skype calls. I don't know what's going

1047
01:14:51,640 --> 01:14:55,860
on though that people would. People freaking call or we set you on fire and do nothing

1048
01:14:55,860 --> 01:14:59,860
about talk about Britney Spears' baby.

1049
01:14:59,860 --> 01:15:02,860
No, I don't want to. Didn't you do that last week?

1050
01:15:02,860 --> 01:15:04,860
Okay, let's have Britney Spears do section chat.

1051
01:15:04,860 --> 01:15:09,860
Ew, gross. God. I would rather go back to talking about the sheepskin con.

1052
01:15:09,860 --> 01:15:13,860
She's worried that her scar won't go away.

1053
01:15:13,860 --> 01:15:15,860
Poor thing.

1054
01:15:15,860 --> 01:15:18,860
You know, and of course she spoke the whole time. She carried a rat.

1055
01:15:18,860 --> 01:15:21,860
Hey, look at that. We've got to call them. Just for you, Dark Sakura.

1056
01:15:21,860 --> 01:15:24,860
It's our regular caller on the line.

1057
01:15:24,860 --> 01:15:26,860
How are you?

1058
01:15:26,860 --> 01:15:27,860
Huh?

1059
01:15:27,860 --> 01:15:28,860
Hello?

1060
01:15:28,860 --> 01:15:29,860
Yeah.

1061
01:15:29,860 --> 01:15:31,860
You on Orange One Radio?

1062
01:15:31,860 --> 01:15:33,860
Who's this?

1063
01:15:33,860 --> 01:15:34,860
Yeah?

1064
01:15:34,860 --> 01:15:35,860
Do you think?

1065
01:15:35,860 --> 01:15:37,860
Obviously you know who it is.

1066
01:15:37,860 --> 01:15:39,860
Yes, it's the Legend of Zaku everybody.

1067
01:15:39,860 --> 01:15:42,860
How are you, my friend?

1068
01:15:42,860 --> 01:15:45,860
I'm just, you know, waiting for another, you know,

1069
01:15:45,860 --> 01:15:48,860
just waiting for my Yankees to just finish up the Angels

1070
01:15:48,860 --> 01:15:51,860
so we could take it, we could take it to their, you know,

1071
01:15:51,860 --> 01:15:55,380
you know we could take the game to their place tomorrow and and win what's what's

1072
01:15:55,380 --> 01:15:58,420
baseball what what is the baseball i'm watching

1073
01:15:58,420 --> 01:16:03,620
it's the number one sport in japan ever i'm on the box i love yeah my yankees

1074
01:16:03,620 --> 01:16:07,540
are you know yankees basically are up there

1075
01:16:07,540 --> 01:16:12,500
in breathing and love making i know how it is because in this town where we live

1076
01:16:12,500 --> 01:16:14,980
they don't have a well they do have a minor league baseball team but they have

1077
01:16:14,980 --> 01:16:19,460
a really big basketball team and i swear to god everywhere you go it's kings

1078
01:16:19,460 --> 01:16:23,460
Kings! Kings! Go Kings! We love the Kings! Ahhh!

1079
01:16:23,460 --> 01:16:24,460
Oh, not the Kings.

1080
01:16:24,460 --> 01:16:29,460
And I'm all like, you know, I left Alabama to get over the Auburn, Alabama fixation,

1081
01:16:29,460 --> 01:16:30,460
and I come out here and it's like,

1082
01:16:30,460 --> 01:16:31,460
Yankees don't suck.

1083
01:16:31,460 --> 01:16:32,460
Wings! Wings!

1084
01:16:32,460 --> 01:16:35,460
Whoever the hell's saying that in the chatroom, Yankees do not suck.

1085
01:16:35,460 --> 01:16:36,460
Boston sucks.

1086
01:16:36,460 --> 01:16:41,460
Zaku, tell me something video game related, please. What's on your mind?

1087
01:16:41,460 --> 01:16:46,460
Uh, Digital Life starts this Friday, so I'm heading there this Saturday.

1088
01:16:46,460 --> 01:16:50,820
I don't know if I'm going to compete in freestyle because I'm having second thoughts.

1089
01:16:50,820 --> 01:16:54,660
The fact that I don't have any money to prepare for a really good one is just making it worse.

1090
01:16:54,660 --> 01:16:59,220
Zaku, I've judged DDR freestyle competitions in my day.

1091
01:16:59,220 --> 01:17:04,700
I haven't done one in a long-ass time, nobody's ass, but I've judged a few, and trust me Zaku,

1092
01:17:04,700 --> 01:17:07,100
you couldn't be as bad as some of the ones I've seen in my life.

1093
01:17:07,100 --> 01:17:11,900
I know, I've done it before, I've done a really good one even though I DQ'd, but this year

1094
01:17:11,900 --> 01:17:17,900
You know, in the tournament this year, they're using an impartial jury.

1095
01:17:17,900 --> 01:17:22,900
In other words, they're using people that don't know shit about DER.

1096
01:17:22,900 --> 01:17:25,900
Does that mean you're going to have a horribly scored tournament?

1097
01:17:25,900 --> 01:17:34,900
No, because last year, the judges were biased and basically handed people victories where they should have won.

1098
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:39,900
No, no, no, no. That's why you have equal representation.

1099
01:17:39,900 --> 01:17:46,900
let me finish before you go jumping all over me

1100
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:51,260
that's why you need equal representation you need a certain number of people

1101
01:17:51,260 --> 01:17:53,280
who know

1102
01:17:53,280 --> 01:17:55,160
what good freestyle is

1103
01:17:55,160 --> 01:17:59,460
you need people who you need at least one freestyle winner in there

1104
01:17:59,460 --> 01:18:02,220
and you need to have two people on there

1105
01:18:02,220 --> 01:18:06,060
who may not have competed in DDR but people who

1106
01:18:06,060 --> 01:18:07,540
you know

1107
01:18:07,540 --> 01:18:11,920
trust to be impartial, and I think that you do need to have judges who have not actually

1108
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:12,920
played.

1109
01:18:12,920 --> 01:18:13,920
I agree with the mix.

1110
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:14,920
I agree with the mix.

1111
01:18:14,920 --> 01:18:19,520
We did have that last year, and it failed, because that ended up doing more harm than

1112
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:20,520
good.

1113
01:18:20,520 --> 01:18:21,520
We had everything that we said, Jamie.

1114
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:22,520
Really?

1115
01:18:22,520 --> 01:18:24,760
That's what I've done before, and I've had success.

1116
01:18:24,760 --> 01:18:26,760
That has to do with the people.

1117
01:18:26,760 --> 01:18:28,900
Yeah, because we have to play it safe.

1118
01:18:28,900 --> 01:18:33,120
We don't want any bullshit, and we don't want any bullshit from other people saying that

1119
01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:35,800
they got screwed over, that they should have won.

1120
01:18:35,800 --> 01:18:42,800
I heard the stories of people acting very biased in the judging.

1121
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:45,800
Those people should never get asked to judge in the first place.

1122
01:18:45,800 --> 01:18:48,800
I guess it's our only choice.

1123
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:55,800
Another thing, also in digital life, they're going to be debuting Guitar Hero over there,

1124
01:18:55,800 --> 01:18:59,800
so hopefully I'll be able to play it this Saturday.

1125
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:06,200
Well, by next Sunday I should be able to let you know of how it is, to give you like the...

1126
01:19:06,200 --> 01:19:10,620
I really wish we were able to get a sneak peek at Guitar Hero 2, but you know, sometimes

1127
01:19:10,620 --> 01:19:13,680
we just, you know, don't get our way.

1128
01:19:13,680 --> 01:19:19,560
Hopefully, as I said, you know, I still have time to register for Freestyle, but at this

1129
01:19:19,560 --> 01:19:24,560
point, I wish I had the money to really, you know, really invest on something, you know,

1130
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:27,200
something memorable and something that will even give me odds.

1131
01:19:27,200 --> 01:19:36,200
I wish I could have gone to Digital Life. I would have judged you a fair tournament, I swear.

1132
01:19:36,200 --> 01:19:37,200
I know, man.

1133
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:40,200
I'm going to let you go because we have other people who want to get in.

1134
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:41,200
But have a good night, Zaku, okay?

1135
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:42,200
All right, man.

1136
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:43,200
All right, later.

1137
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:44,200
All right, later.

1138
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:46,200
Our regular caller there, Zaku, getting in there.

1139
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:48,200
Getting a little heated there with DarkSacker about the judging.

1140
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:51,200
You know, I remember we were planning the very, very first tournament.

1141
01:19:51,200 --> 01:19:54,200
We've done that at every tournament we've run, and it's always worked.

1142
01:19:54,200 --> 01:19:57,920
worked we were we we did have that mix I remember scat in particular we have

1143
01:19:57,920 --> 01:20:01,040
like a mix of people and actually one person we were trying to get for the

1144
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:04,000
longest time unfortunately had to back out at the last minute we were actually

1145
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:07,000
trying to get a dance teacher yeah and be a judge I remember that cuz he's a

1146
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:10,880
friend of mine so I that would have been great I think that's a good good person

1147
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:14,680
to get to judge your tournament but anyway moving on let's see what the next

1148
01:20:14,680 --> 01:20:21,680
and

1149
01:20:24,920 --> 01:20:28,400
uh... your microphone on caller

1150
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:32,740
can you have a throw it's a new caller calling in so i think maybe it's not

1151
01:20:32,740 --> 01:20:33,760
working right

1152
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:38,120
but uh... echo one to be added to that go one to three a car and try a stack

1153
01:20:38,120 --> 01:20:39,800
righty have gone

1154
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:43,840
so you gotta remember guys uh... before you call in the first time it might is

1155
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:48,760
is always a good idea to call. There's a username on Skype, Echo123. Make sure you can hear

1156
01:20:48,760 --> 01:20:51,700
yourself. But, you know, that kind of stuff is bound to happen. We appreciate the new

1157
01:20:51,700 --> 01:20:55,720
people who are at least trying to get through. Not that we don't like hearing from the regulars,

1158
01:20:55,720 --> 01:21:00,480
but, you know, new blood once in a while is a good thing. Let's go to, oh damn, our lines

1159
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:03,560
are lighting up here. Let's go to another call. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1160
01:21:03,560 --> 01:21:08,900
Hey, Sky, it's El Mullet calling. El Mullet, how the hell have you been?

1161
01:21:08,900 --> 01:21:11,960
I have been doing pretty damn good, Sky. How about yourself?

1162
01:21:11,960 --> 01:21:17,260
Good! I have not heard from you in like three months. Where you been?

1163
01:21:17,260 --> 01:21:20,800
I dropped off the face of the earth. Funny story, but we'll get to that in a minute.

1164
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:25,020
Okay, well what's on your mind? What do we owe this call to today?

1165
01:21:25,020 --> 01:21:29,840
I think I missed the initial hullabaloo on Xtreme 2, and just want to offer my input

1166
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:32,420
on it. Sure, yeah. A lot of people really appreciate

1167
01:21:32,420 --> 01:21:36,240
your input, because of course you write reviews, and of course I'll let you get your plug.

1168
01:21:36,240 --> 01:21:39,240
Are you still working for those guys? Yes, I am. I am.

1169
01:21:39,240 --> 01:21:42,840
I'll let you work in your plug there, but a lot of folks in the Bomani scene really

1170
01:21:42,840 --> 01:21:48,720
trust your reviews on the game, so I'm very curious to hear your thoughts on Extreme 2.

1171
01:21:48,720 --> 01:21:50,980
Extreme 2 really impressed me.

1172
01:21:50,980 --> 01:21:56,640
Maybe not as much as a song list, a song list was great anyway, but the presentation really

1173
01:21:56,640 --> 01:21:58,060
impressed me.

1174
01:21:58,060 --> 01:22:06,620
The fact that Dance Master mode is now the official mode of the game, it's more like

1175
01:22:06,620 --> 01:22:09,080
other games you know like

1176
01:22:09,080 --> 01:22:10,280
if they'd like to

1177
01:22:10,280 --> 01:22:14,080
this uh... this is what i said about last week amor is that it feels less

1178
01:22:14,080 --> 01:22:18,260
like an arcade port and more like a playstation game

1179
01:22:18,260 --> 01:22:21,620
as opposed to trying to copy exactly what's going on in the arcade

1180
01:22:21,620 --> 01:22:24,200
having to dance master will be the simply makes it feel more like

1181
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:25,960
something this for

1182
01:22:25,960 --> 01:22:30,000
the home and since we're not getting a new arcade mix anytime soon it's kind of

1183
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:31,760
interesting to see the

1184
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:34,320
franchise really now for the first time

1185
01:22:34,320 --> 01:22:36,520
in america kind of growing out of that

1186
01:22:36,520 --> 01:22:37,920
So it's kind of neat.

1187
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:39,240
Yeah, exactly.

1188
01:22:39,240 --> 01:22:40,840
And also the background movies.

1189
01:22:40,840 --> 01:22:45,040
I cannot get enough of all of these new movies, especially since there's so many

1190
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:48,240
exclusive movies for a particular song.

1191
01:22:48,240 --> 01:22:52,500
I mean, Daikin Kai jumped like a million points for me.

1192
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:55,000
I play that for the movie.

1193
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:56,000
It's got some great video.

1194
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:59,600
I still have yet to see some of the ones, like the one for Sakurai here is really good,

1195
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:02,520
and some of the other ones, because I haven't played enough Dance Master Mode.

1196
01:23:02,520 --> 01:23:06,120
Believe it or not, I'm actually playing Dance Master Mode on a pad.

1197
01:23:06,120 --> 01:23:10,040
So I'm getting flow for some of them.

1198
01:23:10,040 --> 01:23:16,400
Yeah, it took me a week to unlock all the songs.

1199
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:21,280
I ended up with like 73, then I took a break for a few days, and then I came back to it

1200
01:23:21,280 --> 01:23:24,240
and unlocked Survivor Max.

1201
01:23:24,240 --> 01:23:26,480
Have you had a chance to play the online mode?

1202
01:23:26,480 --> 01:23:28,640
Unfortunately no, not yet.

1203
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:33,600
I've tried to find time for it, but things keep popping up, and I'd rather be unlocking

1204
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:37,080
courses and whatnot because I'm an unlock whore.

1205
01:23:37,080 --> 01:23:38,960
Right, right.

1206
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:43,760
Although, is it true or not, I haven't really heard any follow-up on this.

1207
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:47,200
Some rumors are going around that the game will give you pity unlocks.

1208
01:23:47,200 --> 01:23:50,240
If you go for a long time without unlocking anything that it finally just starts giving

1209
01:23:50,240 --> 01:23:51,240
them to you.

1210
01:23:51,240 --> 01:23:55,960
Yes, I can confirm that you will get pity stuff showing up in the shop for no particular

1211
01:23:55,960 --> 01:23:56,960
reason.

1212
01:23:56,960 --> 01:23:57,960
Great.

1213
01:23:57,960 --> 01:24:03,960
say this because I go back and I do the extra arrow missions and the

1214
01:24:03,960 --> 01:24:08,580
alternate conditions and as I'm doing that and unlocking the hidden missions

1215
01:24:08,580 --> 01:24:14,320
I'm getting a bunch of songs appear in the shop and it's really interesting

1216
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:21,680
because I ended up unlocking all the characters at one point and once

1217
01:24:21,680 --> 01:24:26,680
I unlocked my last character a bunch of songs showed

1218
01:24:26,680 --> 01:24:30,440
up for no reason. I noticed a bunch of songs randomly showed

1219
01:24:30,440 --> 01:24:34,600
up in my shop too, so, you know, for those folks that are getting angsty with Dance Master

1220
01:24:34,600 --> 01:24:37,560
Mode, just keep trying, and the game will pity you eventually, and you'll start getting

1221
01:24:37,560 --> 01:24:40,240
some cool songs. Exactly.

1222
01:24:40,240 --> 01:24:43,160
One other thing, well first of all, go ahead and give your site a plug, because it's been

1223
01:24:43,160 --> 01:24:49,160
a little while. www.insidepulse.com. We are reviewing games,

1224
01:24:49,160 --> 01:24:51,200
kicking ass, and taking names. Hey, that rhymes.

1225
01:24:51,200 --> 01:24:53,880
Sounds good. And you also do, like, it's not just games,

1226
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:55,720
but there's there's raslin

1227
01:24:55,720 --> 01:24:57,000
and there's uh...

1228
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,640
uh... there's movies and tvs and all that stuff

1229
01:24:59,640 --> 01:25:05,200
so uh... movies and tvs music uh... comic books and action figures the whole

1230
01:25:05,200 --> 01:25:07,540
night never grow up everything nerdy

1231
01:25:07,540 --> 01:25:09,120
everything they just call that

1232
01:25:09,120 --> 01:25:12,640
be a nerd dot com because everything that he

1233
01:25:12,640 --> 01:25:16,040
it's pop culture i know i have to add

1234
01:25:16,040 --> 01:25:20,520
series two of the uh... invader zim figurines are out now and that made me

1235
01:25:20,520 --> 01:25:23,240
extremely excited. Thank you for that completely random footnote.

1236
01:25:23,240 --> 01:25:26,760
Are they, um, you know, in action figures? Yes.

1237
01:25:26,760 --> 01:25:30,400
See what I mean? Nerds! All of you! Nerds!

1238
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:36,120
No, no, you want to talk about Nerds? It's a conversation that I had at Lions about grammar.

1239
01:25:36,120 --> 01:25:40,920
I know, I know. Here we are all sitting on the radio show we've been doing about

1240
01:25:40,920 --> 01:25:44,560
DDR for the past three and a half years.

1241
01:25:44,560 --> 01:25:48,920
Anyway, um, I'm curious also, I have to let you go soon because we're still getting a

1242
01:25:48,920 --> 01:25:50,400
bunch of other calls, but, um,

1243
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:53,640
What I want to ask you about real quick, you know, as somebody who reviews games and has

1244
01:25:53,640 --> 01:25:57,460
been doing it for a little while, what do you think about this whole Xbox 360 thing?

1245
01:25:57,460 --> 01:25:59,240
Are you going to pick one up at launch?

1246
01:25:59,240 --> 01:26:04,660
No, I'm not, because for one, I don't like a pricing structure in order to get the good

1247
01:26:04,660 --> 01:26:12,640
system with the hard drive, I have to drop an extra hundred bucks, and so far the games,

1248
01:26:12,640 --> 01:26:18,000
especially the launch window, outside of Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion, there's really not much

1249
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:21,300
I'm looking forward to that I can't play on my normal Xbox.

1250
01:26:21,300 --> 01:26:23,300
Oh, there you have it.

1251
01:26:23,300 --> 01:26:25,800
All right. Well, Elmoet, thanks so much for calling in.

1252
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:28,800
It's really good to hear from you. Don't be a stranger, all right?

1253
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:29,300
All right.

1254
01:26:29,300 --> 01:26:32,800
And when's that EX2 review going to be up?

1255
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:36,000
Hopefully during this week, if I can manage it.

1256
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:37,500
All right, sounds good.

1257
01:26:37,500 --> 01:26:40,400
Elmoet from InsidePulse.com, thank you so much for calling in.

1258
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:42,200
Have a good week, okay?

1259
01:26:42,200 --> 01:26:42,600
You too.

1260
01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:44,800
All right, later.

1261
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:46,000
We're going to go to another call now.

1262
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:49,700
Now let's go to, I want to pick up somebody new here, this one's been trying to get in

1263
01:26:49,700 --> 01:26:50,700
for a little while here.

1264
01:26:50,700 --> 01:26:52,700
Hello, you're on Orange Lawn's radio!

1265
01:26:52,700 --> 01:26:55,740
Oops, did I actually answer the call?

1266
01:26:55,740 --> 01:26:56,740
Probably not.

1267
01:26:56,740 --> 01:26:57,740
Hello?

1268
01:26:57,740 --> 01:27:00,400
Did I pick both of them up?

1269
01:27:00,400 --> 01:27:05,100
I picked up the wrong, oh that's right, hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio!

1270
01:27:05,100 --> 01:27:06,100
Hello!

1271
01:27:06,100 --> 01:27:09,460
This is the one whose connection wasn't working quite right earlier.

1272
01:27:09,460 --> 01:27:14,580
Still can't hear you buddy, still can't hear you buddy, try it again, alright?

1273
01:27:14,580 --> 01:27:19,580
Um, let's- Oh, damn. There was the one I was gonna pick up. Let's pick up...

1274
01:27:21,580 --> 01:27:23,580
I don't see that one coming in.

1275
01:27:24,580 --> 01:27:25,580
Let's pick up this one.

1276
01:27:25,580 --> 01:27:27,580
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio!

1277
01:27:29,580 --> 01:27:31,580
Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio!

1278
01:27:33,580 --> 01:27:34,580
Hello?

1279
01:27:34,580 --> 01:27:35,580
Hello!

1280
01:27:35,580 --> 01:27:36,580
Hello!

1281
01:27:36,580 --> 01:27:37,580
Hi!

1282
01:27:39,580 --> 01:27:40,080
Can you hear me?

1283
01:27:40,080 --> 01:27:40,580
Hi!

1284
01:27:40,580 --> 01:27:42,580
Hi! You're on Orange Lounge Radio!

1285
01:27:42,580 --> 01:27:49,580
Um, I'm... I think... is this Ross?

1286
01:27:49,580 --> 01:27:52,580
Massive lag. No, this isn't Ross, this is somebody else.

1287
01:27:52,580 --> 01:27:53,580
Hello?

1288
01:27:53,580 --> 01:27:58,580
Hi, I think there's massive lag. What's on your mind? And we'll answer your question or whatever's on your mind. Tell us what's up.

1289
01:27:58,580 --> 01:28:05,580
We have to wait a little bit for the lag here. Let's see what this person has to say.

1290
01:28:05,580 --> 01:28:06,580
Hi.

1291
01:28:06,580 --> 01:28:07,580
Hi.

1292
01:28:07,580 --> 01:28:11,580
Um, well, is it working?

1293
01:28:11,580 --> 01:28:16,580
Yes, it's working. Hurry up and ask your question. What's on your mind? Just ask your question. What's up?

1294
01:28:16,580 --> 01:28:28,580
Well, I don't play music games that much, but I don't know what you're talking about.

1295
01:28:28,580 --> 01:28:36,580
Well, this is Orange Lounge Radio. Our Sunday night program was actually, the station kind of started, it has to do with, you know,

1296
01:28:36,580 --> 01:28:41,020
you know, because the name Orange Lounge actually comes from music-based video games, and that's

1297
01:28:41,020 --> 01:28:46,220
kind of how we grew into kind of what we're doing here, is that we started by talking

1298
01:28:46,220 --> 01:28:47,220
about music video games.

1299
01:28:47,220 --> 01:28:54,100
So this Sunday night show that we do is kind of a throwback to the music-based video games.

1300
01:28:54,100 --> 01:28:56,500
And the podcast was something extra that we added.

1301
01:28:56,500 --> 01:28:59,660
I'm assuming this is somebody who's listening to this show because of the podcast.

1302
01:28:59,660 --> 01:29:02,860
The podcast was something we added a little extra because we wanted to talk about general

1303
01:29:02,860 --> 01:29:03,860
gaming as well.

1304
01:29:03,860 --> 01:29:07,980
But this show is still kind of basically based around the music games.

1305
01:29:07,980 --> 01:29:11,340
So we do like to talk about other really random stuff once in a while, too, though.

1306
01:29:11,340 --> 01:29:15,620
So it's not 100% music games, but we really owe it to our fans who have supported us for

1307
01:29:15,620 --> 01:29:16,620
the past three and a half years.

1308
01:29:16,620 --> 01:29:22,620
We do like to stay on what's going on in the DDR and in the music gaming scene.

1309
01:29:22,620 --> 01:29:27,620
And music games could be anything from Parappa the Rapper to DDR, Dance Dance Revolution

1310
01:29:27,620 --> 01:29:33,820
to Beatmania, Guitar Hero, Guitar Man, just about anything that involves music and gaming.

1311
01:29:33,820 --> 01:29:35,500
Ryan Robb likes to talk a lot.

1312
01:29:35,500 --> 01:29:36,820
I do, I really do.

1313
01:29:36,820 --> 01:29:37,660
And people listen.

1314
01:29:37,660 --> 01:29:39,180
Anyway, that person hung up.

1315
01:29:39,180 --> 01:29:42,980
So you know, I think there was just too much lag there.

1316
01:29:42,980 --> 01:29:44,260
But you know, people listen.

1317
01:29:44,260 --> 01:29:45,100
You might learn something.

1318
01:29:45,100 --> 01:29:47,820
And I'll tell you what, just like any genre of video games,

1319
01:29:47,820 --> 01:29:49,740
there's really, really good music games out there

1320
01:29:49,740 --> 01:29:50,820
that you should check out.

1321
01:29:50,820 --> 01:29:52,860
And there's really bad ones that you should just

1322
01:29:52,860 --> 01:29:54,060
frickin' avoid at all costs.

1323
01:29:54,060 --> 01:29:55,340
Low-key, just don't even bother.

1324
01:29:55,340 --> 01:29:56,860
We all know what you're going to say.

1325
01:29:56,860 --> 01:29:58,580
All right, this is the one you wanted to talk to, Darksyra.

1326
01:29:58,580 --> 01:29:59,260
Yep.

1327
01:29:59,260 --> 01:30:04,020
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio!

1328
01:30:04,020 --> 01:30:07,060
Hello, you are on Orange Lounge Radio!

1329
01:30:07,060 --> 01:30:08,660
Can you hear us?

1330
01:30:08,660 --> 01:30:13,860
Turn down your speakers! If you can hear us, we cannot hear you, my friend.

1331
01:30:13,860 --> 01:30:16,700
Wait, wait, wait. I'm going to send an IM real quick.

1332
01:30:16,700 --> 01:30:19,580
Just a reminder, because we had a lot of new people calling in tonight,

1333
01:30:19,580 --> 01:30:21,720
maybe somebody can post this in the chat room as well.

1334
01:30:21,720 --> 01:30:25,860
The first time, before the first time you call, it's always a good idea to call.

1335
01:30:25,860 --> 01:30:28,140
It's a username on Skype, Echo,

1336
01:30:28,140 --> 01:30:32,200
one two three and then that we can test your connection and see if you can hear

1337
01:30:32,200 --> 01:30:34,500
yourself because it's a really good way to test the connection

1338
01:30:34,500 --> 01:30:37,980
let me try one more time here are you there young

1339
01:30:37,980 --> 01:30:40,720
can you hear us

1340
01:30:40,720 --> 01:30:42,240
hello hi

1341
01:30:42,240 --> 01:30:43,960
with that

1342
01:30:43,960 --> 01:30:45,120
uh... this is for us

1343
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:50,280
hi ross what's on your mind

1344
01:30:50,280 --> 01:30:52,220
this time

1345
01:30:52,220 --> 01:30:55,580
how you doing what do you think you got a question for us well what are you

1346
01:30:55,580 --> 01:30:56,580
I'm calling in about tonight.

1347
01:30:56,580 --> 01:30:57,580
You can't hear us.

1348
01:30:57,580 --> 01:30:58,580
You can't hear me.

1349
01:30:58,580 --> 01:31:01,580
I can hear you.

1350
01:31:01,580 --> 01:31:02,580
Oh.

1351
01:31:02,580 --> 01:31:05,580
Is the call lagged by like 45 seconds?

1352
01:31:05,580 --> 01:31:06,580
I don't know.

1353
01:31:06,580 --> 01:31:07,580
I don't know.

1354
01:31:07,580 --> 01:31:08,580
Maybe we're a little lagged.

1355
01:31:08,580 --> 01:31:11,580
I think the call was incredibly lagged here, because I think she's just now getting the

1356
01:31:11,580 --> 01:31:12,580
stuff we said in the beginning.

1357
01:31:12,580 --> 01:31:14,580
Roz, I'm going to have to let you go for it right now.

1358
01:31:14,580 --> 01:31:17,580
I'm really sorry, but try calling us back in a little while.

1359
01:31:17,580 --> 01:31:18,580
Something's up with the connection tonight.

1360
01:31:18,580 --> 01:31:19,580
I don't know what's going on.

1361
01:31:19,580 --> 01:31:20,580
Yeah, I'm still here.

1362
01:31:20,580 --> 01:31:21,580
Yeah.

1363
01:31:21,580 --> 01:31:22,580
Mm-hmm.

1364
01:31:22,580 --> 01:31:26,140
Maybe she'll get to the question.

1365
01:31:26,140 --> 01:31:28,700
The question part should be coming up now on the call.

1366
01:31:28,700 --> 01:31:30,500
Live radio, everybody.

1367
01:31:30,500 --> 01:31:32,420
Yeah.

1368
01:31:32,420 --> 01:31:33,540
Yeah, she's getting lag.

1369
01:31:33,540 --> 01:31:35,120
OK, I figure it's probably really lag.

1370
01:31:40,120 --> 01:31:41,860
OK, we're going to have to go ahead and let

1371
01:31:41,860 --> 01:31:42,700
Ros go for right now.

1372
01:31:42,700 --> 01:31:44,900
But hopefully she'll give us a call back a little later

1373
01:31:44,900 --> 01:31:45,940
in the program.

1374
01:31:45,940 --> 01:31:47,660
Let's try to go to this call.

1375
01:31:47,660 --> 01:31:50,020
Remember, guys, Echo 123, unfortunately, lag.

1376
01:31:50,020 --> 01:31:51,980
There's not a whole lot we can do about.

1377
01:31:51,980 --> 01:31:53,400
but we'll give it a try.

1378
01:31:53,400 --> 01:31:55,440
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1379
01:31:55,440 --> 01:31:56,200
Oh, hi.

1380
01:31:56,200 --> 01:31:57,640
Hi.

1381
01:31:57,640 --> 01:31:58,680
Hold on, I'm getting an echo,

1382
01:31:58,680 --> 01:32:00,720
because I'm still listening to your show.

1383
01:32:00,720 --> 01:32:01,680
That's all right.

1384
01:32:01,680 --> 01:32:02,840
Luckily we don't hear it,

1385
01:32:02,840 --> 01:32:05,140
and I'm very happy that we're picking up a call

1386
01:32:05,140 --> 01:32:07,600
that's unlagged and we can hear the person just fine.

1387
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:08,440
It's all good.

1388
01:32:08,440 --> 01:32:10,100
So go ahead and turn that down,

1389
01:32:10,100 --> 01:32:11,360
and what's on your mind?

1390
01:32:15,680 --> 01:32:17,200
Actually, I don't really know.

1391
01:32:17,200 --> 01:32:18,440
Okay, well who's this?

1392
01:32:18,440 --> 01:32:19,440
Introduce yourself.

1393
01:32:19,440 --> 01:32:23,080
Um, this is, uh, Xander from Florida.

1394
01:32:23,080 --> 01:32:24,080
Hi, Xander.

1395
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:25,080
So there's...

1396
01:32:25,080 --> 01:32:26,080
Yeah.

1397
01:32:26,080 --> 01:32:27,080
Hi, Xander from Florida.

1398
01:32:27,080 --> 01:32:28,080
So there's, like...

1399
01:32:28,080 --> 01:32:29,080
Yeah.

1400
01:32:29,080 --> 01:32:30,080
There's a massive, uh, time difference.

1401
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:31,080
So it's, like, 11 o'clock here.

1402
01:32:31,080 --> 01:32:32,080
And I'm staying up way past my bedtime.

1403
01:32:32,080 --> 01:32:33,080
I...

1404
01:32:33,080 --> 01:32:34,080
I know.

1405
01:32:34,080 --> 01:32:35,080
We...

1406
01:32:35,080 --> 01:32:37,080
We really kind of screw over our East Coast fans with the timing of the show.

1407
01:32:37,080 --> 01:32:42,040
But the problem is, is that, you know, we're all people that work during the week, Monday

1408
01:32:42,040 --> 01:32:43,040
through Friday.

1409
01:32:43,040 --> 01:32:45,920
So Saturday and Sunday are kind of, like, our days off.

1410
01:32:45,920 --> 01:32:50,280
So if we were to do our show at like 4.30 or a time, it would cater more to the East

1411
01:32:50,280 --> 01:32:51,280
Coast folks.

1412
01:32:51,280 --> 01:32:54,920
We would pretty much be losing a day of our weekend, so that's unfortunately why we have

1413
01:32:54,920 --> 01:32:58,200
to do it early, so, or, I mean, later on.

1414
01:32:58,200 --> 01:33:00,320
And we are paid well enough to start early.

1415
01:33:00,320 --> 01:33:02,320
We don't get paid for this crap, either, so.

1416
01:33:02,320 --> 01:33:06,920
But of course, that's another reason why we do the podcast, is so that folks can download

1417
01:33:06,920 --> 01:33:07,920
that whenever they want.

1418
01:33:07,920 --> 01:33:08,920
I like the podcast.

1419
01:33:08,920 --> 01:33:11,360
So I'm assuming you heard about the show through the podcast?

1420
01:33:11,360 --> 01:33:14,680
No, actually, I heard about it through DDR Freak.

1421
01:33:14,680 --> 01:33:15,680
Oh, right on.

1422
01:33:15,680 --> 01:33:19,480
Yeah, we got a lot of folks from DDR Freak, because, you know, people horror, I, I, I

1423
01:33:19,480 --> 01:33:21,480
I haven't warned you for anything yet, have I?

1424
01:33:22,680 --> 01:33:25,480
No, actually, I don't, I'm not on the forums, I just, you know.

1425
01:33:25,480 --> 01:33:25,980
Okay.

1426
01:33:25,980 --> 01:33:26,480
Who's a lurker?

1427
01:33:26,480 --> 01:33:27,780
I will, because I will if you want me to.

1428
01:33:27,780 --> 01:33:30,480
He's a lurker, he's a lawyer, he just watches.

1429
01:33:30,480 --> 01:33:31,280
That's awesome.

1430
01:33:31,280 --> 01:33:32,480
I'm a lurker on a lot of stuff.

1431
01:33:32,480 --> 01:33:33,480
That's good, alright.

1432
01:33:33,480 --> 01:33:34,980
Yay, we have a stalker!

1433
01:33:34,980 --> 01:33:39,480
Look, uh, I wanted to talk to Jamie about it in the group.

1434
01:33:39,480 --> 01:33:40,080
Okay.

1435
01:33:40,080 --> 01:33:42,080
Uh oh, uh oh, I'm in trouble.

1436
01:33:42,080 --> 01:33:43,080
Alright, what's up?

1437
01:33:43,080 --> 01:33:50,120
Okay, I'm a big fan of In the Groove, and I would say that you are massively wrong in

1438
01:33:50,120 --> 01:33:53,720
saying that it is a rip-off, and it's extremely-

1439
01:33:53,720 --> 01:33:54,720
Wait, wait, wait.

1440
01:33:54,720 --> 01:33:55,720
I'm finished.

1441
01:33:55,720 --> 01:33:56,720
I'm finished.

1442
01:33:56,720 --> 01:33:57,720
Yes?

1443
01:33:57,720 --> 01:33:58,720
Go ahead.

1444
01:33:58,720 --> 01:34:00,600
Yeah, I find it much more fun than DDR.

1445
01:34:00,600 --> 01:34:01,600
How is it not a rip-off?

1446
01:34:01,600 --> 01:34:06,600
Well- I don't want examples, item by item.

1447
01:34:06,600 --> 01:34:07,600
Hold on.

1448
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:08,600
Let's imagine it's just-

1449
01:34:08,600 --> 01:34:09,600
It's so much fun.

1450
01:34:09,600 --> 01:34:12,600
It's triplicate.

1451
01:34:12,600 --> 01:34:15,240
What is more fun, let me see if I can phrase it,

1452
01:34:15,240 --> 01:34:19,640
what is more fun for you for In the Groove as opposed to DDR?

1453
01:34:19,640 --> 01:34:24,920
Well, once I got to about the 9-footers in DDR,

1454
01:34:24,920 --> 01:34:29,160
it got kind of boring for me, because it just kind of stagnated at that point.

1455
01:34:29,160 --> 01:34:32,240
And then the 10s, there's too much of a gap between the 9s and the 10s,

1456
01:34:32,240 --> 01:34:35,440
so it's too hard to get into the max and stuff.

1457
01:34:35,440 --> 01:34:39,920
So I find with In the Groove, you have much harder 9s on expert,

1458
01:34:39,920 --> 01:34:42,200
and easier 10s, so the gap is kind of close.

1459
01:34:42,200 --> 01:34:46,920
and I can have a lot more fun in between, which is basically where I am, so.

1460
01:34:46,920 --> 01:34:51,040
Just out of curiosity, do you play on controller or play on actual dance pad?

1461
01:34:51,040 --> 01:34:56,680
No, I play on the dance mat. What dance mat are you using?

1462
01:34:56,680 --> 01:35:02,680
The red octane, the foam mat. Okay, my Ignition 3.0.

1463
01:35:02,680 --> 01:35:05,160
Ignition 3.0. No, 2.0.

1464
01:35:05,160 --> 01:35:10,000
Oh, 2.0. Okay, so for you, the thing that makes In the Groove a little more exciting

1465
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:16,480
than DDR is the fact that there's more middle-ground, like, nine-and-a-half level

1466
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:17,480
step patterns.

1467
01:35:17,480 --> 01:35:20,400
That some of the step patterns cater more to an advanced level.

1468
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:21,400
Right.

1469
01:35:21,400 --> 01:35:22,400
And Charlene's awesome.

1470
01:35:22,400 --> 01:35:24,600
That's never been my point.

1471
01:35:24,600 --> 01:35:29,200
My point is that it took something and basically stole the idea.

1472
01:35:29,200 --> 01:35:33,960
I'm very much one for innovation, and there is, like, no innovation.

1473
01:35:33,960 --> 01:35:34,960
They basically took DDR.

1474
01:35:34,960 --> 01:35:39,440
Well, they've got the hands and the minds, and they're willing to do much harder songs

1475
01:35:39,440 --> 01:35:41,880
than Konami was ever willing to do with DDR, so...

1476
01:35:41,880 --> 01:35:48,560
But the fact remains that you take a game using four arrows that you have to step on

1477
01:35:48,560 --> 01:35:49,560
in pattern.

1478
01:35:49,560 --> 01:35:55,520
Well, I'm gonna say the same thing about Dragon Warrior and Final Fantasy.

1479
01:35:55,520 --> 01:35:58,160
I mean, they're the same style of game, but that doesn't mean they're a rip-off of each

1480
01:35:58,160 --> 01:35:59,160
other.

1481
01:35:59,160 --> 01:36:06,960
The systems are complete, we're actually, you can't compare RPGs that come out at the

1482
01:36:06,960 --> 01:36:07,960
same time.

1483
01:36:07,960 --> 01:36:12,560
comparing Grundio with Final Fantasy, though they have two different combat systems.

1484
01:36:12,560 --> 01:36:17,360
I've heard a similar argument to this before, and it's saying that you don't say Mario and

1485
01:36:17,360 --> 01:36:23,440
Sonic is the common one I heard, but for me, honestly, Mario and Sonic is not the accurate

1486
01:36:23,440 --> 01:36:27,080
comparison when it comes to In the Groove and DDR4 Me, it's Mario and this old Commodore

1487
01:36:27,080 --> 01:36:32,120
64 game called The Great Giana Sisters, which was an awful lot like Mario Bros., except

1488
01:36:32,120 --> 01:36:36,200
it had a couple, it was girls, and there was a couple extra things in it, but...

1489
01:36:36,200 --> 01:36:40,320
That's why I can hear Sonic and Jazz Jackrabbit, okay?

1490
01:36:40,320 --> 01:36:44,880
But the whole fact of the matter remains, and this is why, to this day, I will be against

1491
01:36:44,880 --> 01:36:51,360
In the Groove, was the fact that they were saying, hey, take DDR machines and modify

1492
01:36:51,360 --> 01:36:52,360
them.

1493
01:36:52,360 --> 01:36:53,360
You know, let's break...

1494
01:36:53,360 --> 01:36:56,480
That's why they have the dedicated cabinets now, for In the Groove 2.

1495
01:36:56,480 --> 01:37:02,960
Right, they have that now, but the whole fact remains that the origin of In the Groove was

1496
01:37:02,960 --> 01:37:05,320
a rip-off and modification of DDR.

1497
01:37:05,320 --> 01:37:09,720
What about StepMania? StepMania was never marketed for sale.

1498
01:37:09,720 --> 01:37:13,720
Well, the In the Groove is kind of StepMania marketed for sale in a way.

1499
01:37:13,720 --> 01:37:17,600
You could argue that. Exactly. Had StepMania been released as an item

1500
01:37:17,600 --> 01:37:22,000
for sale, which is why I was against those kits that they were selling on eBay, the same

1501
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:27,460
thing. It is a rip-off. It is stealing proprietary information from

1502
01:37:27,460 --> 01:37:29,240
Kami. All right.

1503
01:37:29,240 --> 01:37:33,960
That is where my point is. And to this day, I will consider In the Groove

1504
01:37:33,960 --> 01:37:38,400
a cheap knock-off because they will not admit their fault.

1505
01:37:38,400 --> 01:37:41,760
Despite the fact, now to play devil's advocate here with our caller a little bit, despite

1506
01:37:41,760 --> 01:37:47,500
the fact that In the Groove might have some, you know, more challenging steps in songs

1507
01:37:47,500 --> 01:37:49,520
that appeal to a different audience.

1508
01:37:49,520 --> 01:37:53,800
I will give it that it's got interesting steps, although the earlier level steps are actually

1509
01:37:53,800 --> 01:37:54,800
complete crap.

1510
01:37:54,800 --> 01:37:56,800
I do like some of the music better.

1511
01:37:56,800 --> 01:37:57,800
Okay.

1512
01:37:57,800 --> 01:38:01,880
The only reason that I didn't play anything harder on In the Groove when I played it is

1513
01:38:01,880 --> 01:38:06,800
I was fresh off of a car accident. You know, I was having this issue with my hip wanting

1514
01:38:06,800 --> 01:38:11,360
to dislocate itself every time I stepped funny. But, um, so I didn't get the chance to try

1515
01:38:11,360 --> 01:38:15,560
anything harder. I'm not saying it's not a fun game. I'm not saying it doesn't offer

1516
01:38:15,560 --> 01:38:19,800
challenge. My whole point comes with the origin of the game, and that's why I'm against it.

1517
01:38:19,800 --> 01:38:22,640
Okay. This is not an easy topic. We've been here before.

1518
01:38:22,640 --> 01:38:27,520
I don't believe in thievery in the industry. What, Loki? I'm sure you're just dying over

1519
01:38:27,520 --> 01:38:30,600
there, Loki. I'm not dying at anything. No, honestly, I

1520
01:38:30,600 --> 01:38:34,600
I don't like the game. I don't expect everyone to agree with me. I'm not trying to like the game.

1521
01:38:34,600 --> 01:38:41,600
What I don't like about the game? First off, the interface is extremely plain. It just, it looks like whoever made the skin, like, crapped it out in about five minutes.

1522
01:38:41,600 --> 01:38:46,600
The songs are all very generic. They sound very alike, and it's just really generic sounding stuff.

1523
01:38:46,600 --> 01:38:54,600
The step patterns suck. I don't like them. I don't like the fact that there are hands and feet, or whatever, you know, the hands part of it, because it's retarded.

1524
01:38:54,600 --> 01:39:02,440
I was kind of against the whole involvement of the iToy for DDR.

1525
01:39:02,440 --> 01:39:06,160
I'm talking about the three steps at once or the four steps at once.

1526
01:39:06,160 --> 01:39:07,160
It's retarded.

1527
01:39:07,160 --> 01:39:08,160
It's just like Pump It Up.

1528
01:39:08,160 --> 01:39:10,160
Yeah, and I hate it in Pump It Up.

1529
01:39:10,160 --> 01:39:12,280
I hate Pump It Up the way they have that.

1530
01:39:12,280 --> 01:39:16,640
Although, I like, you know what, I really, really like that recent pump release for Home

1531
01:39:16,640 --> 01:39:19,080
because it is an awesome dance game, it really is.

1532
01:39:19,080 --> 01:39:23,200
But still, some of the steps in Pump It Up are just as benign as

1533
01:39:23,200 --> 01:39:27,200
I think all I said was it didn't look like they put that much polish in it. That's it.

1534
01:39:27,200 --> 01:39:32,200
And in the group too, I'm sorry, they didn't put that much polish in that one either. They just changed the interface.

1535
01:39:32,200 --> 01:39:41,200
Yeah, I could have also made a better cover with an afternoon in Illustrator with my, like, all of this, you know, five week skill in Illustrator than they did.

1536
01:39:41,200 --> 01:39:46,200
To each their own. I mean, I don't care if you play the game. I think it's cool if you're supporting another company.

1537
01:39:46,200 --> 01:39:51,040
know what there needs to be more dancing games out there and just maybe deviate a

1538
01:39:51,040 --> 01:39:55,040
little bit more from DVR than you did before I mean I know what will make

1539
01:39:55,040 --> 01:40:00,200
everybody happy we have DVR food mix for they just hire the food mix people and

1540
01:40:00,200 --> 01:40:04,000
say make us a DVR and make some market that and then everyone will be happy. But it

1541
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:08,320
still be a ripoff? I said Konami needs to. Oh Konami. It's a ripoff within the same

1542
01:40:08,320 --> 01:40:14,160
company though that's kind of her point. Alright I get it. But if Konami releases it it's not a ripoff because it's Konami.

1543
01:40:14,160 --> 01:40:17,600
I miss the Konami doing it part. Because it's Konami's intellectual property.

1544
01:40:17,600 --> 01:40:22,840
All right, this discussion's been going on an awful long time, and honestly...

1545
01:40:22,840 --> 01:40:28,440
All I want is for the In the Groove fans to admit that it's a rip-off.

1546
01:40:28,440 --> 01:40:32,960
It's been going on for about ever since the damn game came out, so there's no easy answer,

1547
01:40:32,960 --> 01:40:37,480
but we're just going to have to agree to disagree on this one with In the Groove.

1548
01:40:37,480 --> 01:40:40,880
But thank you for your call and letting us know your side of it, okay?

1549
01:40:40,880 --> 01:40:42,880
Okay. All right, have a good one, buddy.

1550
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:45,680
I completely respect your opinion, by the way.

1551
01:40:45,680 --> 01:40:50,820
Alright, yeah, that's good. Even if I disagree. Alright, later dude.

1552
01:40:50,820 --> 01:40:55,360
Alright, very interesting. I'm just like, you know, I just don't care. I don't.

1553
01:40:55,360 --> 01:41:00,400
But honestly though, it's the same... I'm not even adamant about, like, pointing out that it's a rip-off. Who cares?

1554
01:41:00,400 --> 01:41:05,880
Who cares? That's actually all I care about is people admitting that they basically stole.

1555
01:41:05,880 --> 01:41:09,040
Well, it should all come out in the courts pretty, well, not pretty soon, but...

1556
01:41:09,040 --> 01:41:12,040
Yeah, as soon as Rockstar gets the Smackdown laid off, I'm sure.

1557
01:41:12,040 --> 01:41:15,040
We'll see. Alright, new topic, new title. Let's see if our next caller...

1558
01:41:15,040 --> 01:41:17,040
I'm gonna try this guy one more time here.

1559
01:41:17,040 --> 01:41:18,040
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1560
01:41:18,040 --> 01:41:19,040
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1561
01:41:19,040 --> 01:41:21,040
Hey, listen to this insane...

1562
01:41:21,040 --> 01:41:23,040
I'm not even adamant about, like, pointing out...

1563
01:41:23,040 --> 01:41:24,040
feedback.

1564
01:41:24,040 --> 01:41:27,040
We got really bad feedback there. Turn down your, uh, speakers.

1565
01:41:27,040 --> 01:41:28,040
It's... it's...

1566
01:41:28,040 --> 01:41:29,040
Hello?

1567
01:41:29,040 --> 01:41:30,040
Hello? Yeah.

1568
01:41:30,040 --> 01:41:32,040
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1569
01:41:32,040 --> 01:41:35,040
Yeah, you guys are really choppy.

1570
01:41:35,040 --> 01:41:37,040
It happens. Skype is really weird.

1571
01:41:37,040 --> 01:41:38,040
It's really weird.

1572
01:41:38,040 --> 01:41:44,040
Alright, um, yeah, hey, first time caller, um...

1573
01:41:44,040 --> 01:41:47,040
What's on your mind, my friend?

1574
01:41:47,040 --> 01:41:52,040
Alright, um, main reason I called in, um...

1575
01:41:52,040 --> 01:41:59,040
Assuming that I don't win an Xbox 360 from the, uh, whole Mountain Dew, Pepsi, uh...

1576
01:41:59,040 --> 01:42:06,040
Win an Xbox 360 every 10 minutes thing, uh, that I didn't religiously collect the coin for,

1577
01:42:06,040 --> 01:42:12,040
Um, should I sell my PSP to help fund an Xbox 360 in your opinion?

1578
01:42:12,040 --> 01:42:14,040
We'll sell your PSP to get a...

1579
01:42:14,040 --> 01:42:16,040
Actually, I'm going to say the caller real quick.

1580
01:42:16,040 --> 01:42:20,040
We're going to have to hang up on you because of the feedback, but keep listening.

1581
01:42:20,040 --> 01:42:23,040
Alright, so keep listening, because we're going to get to this guy's call here,

1582
01:42:23,040 --> 01:42:26,040
and we're just getting really bad feedback on that call, but we want to answer the question.

1583
01:42:26,040 --> 01:42:33,040
So the question was, assuming that I cannot win an Xbox 360 through the every ten minutes competition that's going on,

1584
01:42:33,040 --> 01:42:39,040
on, which, you're not going to win one. Well, if you do win one, hats off to you, but everybody

1585
01:42:39,040 --> 01:42:44,080
and their mom, every nerd drinks Mountain Dew, unless they're on a diet, like, you have

1586
01:42:44,080 --> 01:42:45,080
a better chance...

1587
01:42:45,080 --> 01:42:47,600
I'm a nerd, and I don't drink Mountain Dew because I think it tastes like pee.

1588
01:42:47,600 --> 01:42:51,240
You have a better chance of getting a 360 doing one of those referral programs than

1589
01:42:51,240 --> 01:42:52,240
you would doing the...

1590
01:42:52,240 --> 01:42:55,800
You have a better chance of getting a 360 by saving up the money and buying one.

1591
01:42:55,800 --> 01:43:00,080
Not to knock it, though, dude. If you're going to try that way, have fun with it, and Mountain

1592
01:43:00,080 --> 01:43:05,080
Mountain Dew. I like Mountain Dew, but it's too many calories for me. How dumb do I sound?

1593
01:43:05,080 --> 01:43:10,080
But back to the subject, the thing is should he sell his PSP to get an Xbox 360? I think

1594
01:43:10,080 --> 01:43:14,080
that you should sell your PSP to get a Turbo Express, because Better Games came out on

1595
01:43:14,080 --> 01:43:15,080
the Turbo Dew.

1596
01:43:15,080 --> 01:43:16,080
Oh, please.

1597
01:43:16,080 --> 01:43:17,080
Ah, blah, blah, blah.

1598
01:43:17,080 --> 01:43:19,080
You know what they need to bring back? They need to bring back my Liveware, because I

1599
01:43:19,080 --> 01:43:22,080
love that drink, and I don't want to drink Shasta.

1600
01:43:22,080 --> 01:43:25,080
Okay, let me try to give the caller, the person who called in there, who was, by the way,

1601
01:43:25,080 --> 01:43:30,040
I'm trying to remember the name here, it was Keith?

1602
01:43:30,040 --> 01:43:33,840
Keith from Chicago, I think was the guy that just called us there.

1603
01:43:33,840 --> 01:43:37,120
Should I sell a PSP to get an Xbox 360?

1604
01:43:37,120 --> 01:43:38,880
Here's the golden rule of gaming.

1605
01:43:38,880 --> 01:43:42,080
We've said this, if you're gonna judge a system time and time again,

1606
01:43:42,080 --> 01:43:45,960
a system is only as good as the games that they put out on it.

1607
01:43:45,960 --> 01:43:47,000
I have always said that.

1608
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,960
I know you have, and I'm repeating it, because it's the golden rule of gaming,

1609
01:43:49,960 --> 01:43:51,800
and I say apply it here.

1610
01:43:51,800 --> 01:43:54,520
Look at the games that are coming out for Xbox 360.

1611
01:43:54,520 --> 01:43:55,840
Are you into racing games?

1612
01:43:55,840 --> 01:43:57,240
Are you into sports games?

1613
01:43:57,240 --> 01:43:58,920
Is guns something that interests you?

1614
01:43:58,920 --> 01:44:01,280
Is Dead or Alive series something that interests you?

1615
01:44:01,280 --> 01:44:06,040
If these are games that interest you, Xbox 360 is the way to go.

1616
01:44:06,040 --> 01:44:10,000
If, on the other hand, you're more into the types of things that you can do on

1617
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:13,080
the handheld and the things that are gonna be coming out for PSP.

1618
01:44:13,080 --> 01:44:18,520
If you want the new Katamari PSP game, if you want Metal Gear Acid 2 and

1619
01:44:18,520 --> 01:44:21,120
more the tactical games and more portable things, and

1620
01:44:21,120 --> 01:44:27,860
like to watch movies on the go, then PSP is more for you. So, while we can kind of make

1621
01:44:27,860 --> 01:44:34,860
a decision based on what our preference would be, honestly I couldn't decide. I would hold,

1622
01:44:35,520 --> 01:44:41,320
honestly if this were me, if I were absolutely poor and I had no way to afford these games

1623
01:44:41,320 --> 01:44:45,040
right now, I didn't have a job, I was unemployed so I had to cut back on my gaming regardless

1624
01:44:45,040 --> 01:44:51,560
or not, I would probably hold on to my PSP for right now and stick it out a little bit

1625
01:44:51,560 --> 01:44:56,740
longer because there's really nothing that's coming out for the 360 for me right now that's

1626
01:44:56,740 --> 01:45:00,160
making me go, oh my gosh, I have to have this right now.

1627
01:45:00,160 --> 01:45:04,200
And what if you get the 360 and then the PS3 comes out and you're like, oh crap, I wanted

1628
01:45:04,200 --> 01:45:05,200
to get that instead.

1629
01:45:05,200 --> 01:45:06,200
Exactly.

1630
01:45:06,200 --> 01:45:09,680
You know, I would wait until, you know, this stuff comes out, I mean honestly it doesn't

1631
01:45:09,680 --> 01:45:14,440
look like there's that much stuff coming out at launch, and just stick with the PSP for

1632
01:45:14,440 --> 01:45:18,500
now. Especially if you're going to invest in a 360, you're going to be investing quite

1633
01:45:18,500 --> 01:45:19,960
a bit of money. You know what, that's a really good idea.

1634
01:45:19,960 --> 01:45:24,440
See if there's a, when the Xbox 360 comes out and you can play this at GameStop, EB

1635
01:45:24,440 --> 01:45:27,320
Games, your favorite retailer, play the demos, maybe you can make a better decision at that

1636
01:45:27,320 --> 01:45:33,120
point. There's no reason you have to get a 360 the day it comes out unless there's just

1637
01:45:33,120 --> 01:45:36,360
this game you're dying for. Also, I personally do not advocate trading

1638
01:45:36,360 --> 01:45:42,160
in your systems or games unless the game is crap. For the simple reason, I often find

1639
01:45:42,160 --> 01:45:48,020
moments were like, oh, I want to play this game, and I'll go bust out the Neo Geo and

1640
01:45:48,020 --> 01:45:49,980
we can play King of Fighters 2000.

1641
01:45:49,980 --> 01:45:54,060
How many people do we know that has sold back a system and then had to buy it again later?

1642
01:45:54,060 --> 01:45:57,180
I know many, many folks.

1643
01:45:57,180 --> 01:45:58,180
I've done it myself.

1644
01:45:58,180 --> 01:46:03,100
And we ourselves, we have, the only system that we have actually ever gotten rid of was

1645
01:46:03,100 --> 01:46:07,460
our Nintendo 64, and we are borrowing somebody else's.

1646
01:46:07,460 --> 01:46:10,060
So I mean, it doesn't really matter.

1647
01:46:10,060 --> 01:46:14,260
You know, there's been days when we've broken out the Cliccovision and freaking had a growth

1648
01:46:14,260 --> 01:46:15,260
fest.

1649
01:46:15,260 --> 01:46:16,260
Right.

1650
01:46:16,260 --> 01:46:17,260
Or played Venture.

1651
01:46:17,260 --> 01:46:18,260
Sure.

1652
01:46:18,260 --> 01:46:23,200
You know, next, only to put it up, you know, an hour later and break out the, the Turbo

1653
01:46:23,200 --> 01:46:24,740
Graphics and play a bunch of Bonk.

1654
01:46:24,740 --> 01:46:26,220
So I think that's another good element to look at.

1655
01:46:26,220 --> 01:46:30,180
If you're going to sell that PSP back, think to yourself, am I going to regret this later?

1656
01:46:30,180 --> 01:46:34,660
Is there going to be a game coming out for PSP that I'm going to really, really want

1657
01:46:34,660 --> 01:46:35,660
later?

1658
01:46:35,660 --> 01:46:39,100
Like, what, what the hell else is coming out on PSP and the, the Loki, what, what are some

1659
01:46:39,100 --> 01:46:44,660
of the big games that somebody might really be like Grand Theft Auto Liberty

1660
01:46:44,660 --> 01:46:49,300
stories has a good one the gauntlet has been thrown in the chatroom oh what

1661
01:46:49,300 --> 01:46:54,540
happened tons of I have to label off my systems now okay all right anyway um

1662
01:46:54,540 --> 01:46:57,500
before you sell back your PSP make sure it's something you're not going to

1663
01:46:57,500 --> 01:47:01,260
regret later on with the games so that's all really really long-winded answer to

1664
01:47:01,260 --> 01:47:04,300
your question I hope you I hope you're able to still listen and sorry we had to

1665
01:47:04,300 --> 01:47:06,700
let you go there but we were just getting too much feedback and I think

1666
01:47:06,700 --> 01:47:11,860
is being retarded. Skype is being very bad tonight. I'm punishing Skype. I'm not punishing

1667
01:47:11,860 --> 01:47:15,860
our listeners, but I'm punishing Skype, and we're going to sign into Do Not Disturb for

1668
01:47:15,860 --> 01:47:23,180
a little while. That was the last Skype word. Huh? All right. So again, if you want to give

1669
01:47:23,180 --> 01:47:26,780
us feedback, you can always send us an email. You can always join our chat room, and we

1670
01:47:26,780 --> 01:47:31,300
always try to get to this stuff on the show. www.orangeontrade.com, click on Chat. I'd

1671
01:47:31,300 --> 01:47:35,740
really like to hear from this guy, what he thought of our feedback there, and of course

1672
01:47:35,740 --> 01:47:40,760
our forums. I know I've been searching those forums non-stop lately on orangeontradar.com

1673
01:47:40,760 --> 01:47:44,680
and there's been some pretty neat posts and some good questions asked. And I, you know,

1674
01:47:44,680 --> 01:47:49,800
if I'm bored, I always take time to state my opinion there on the forums. So check that

1675
01:47:49,800 --> 01:47:56,200
out as well on orangeontradar.com. All right. And some folks in the chat room are crying

1676
01:47:56,200 --> 01:47:59,080
because they didn't get through on Skype line. So we're really sorry, but we are punishing

1677
01:47:59,080 --> 01:48:01,920
Skype for a little while. If we have some extra time at the end of the show, we'll come

1678
01:48:01,920 --> 01:48:05,540
back to skype okay we promise but for now we're long overdue for a break you

1679
01:48:05,540 --> 01:48:09,580
guys so we're going to go to a break and in this break I think we're gonna play

1680
01:48:09,580 --> 01:48:16,220
something from oh I don't know how about how about an out phase song from bmania

1681
01:48:16,220 --> 01:48:20,460
2dx I've heard this a long time so we'll be back with more orange launch radio

1682
01:48:20,460 --> 01:48:22,460
After this, you guys, stay tuned.

1683
01:49:50,460 --> 01:50:04,960
🎵

1684
01:50:04,960 --> 01:50:09,960
🎵 Charlie, he's a gangly little sister of mine 🎵

1685
01:50:09,960 --> 01:50:13,460
🎵 Never say of the drugs and the wine 🎵

1686
01:50:13,460 --> 01:50:16,460
🎵 Don't get lost in the danger you see 🎵

1687
01:50:16,460 --> 01:50:18,460
My sister Charlene

1688
01:50:19,460 --> 01:50:21,460
Stay out Charlene

1689
01:50:22,460 --> 01:50:24,460
Just beware of the dark side of town

1690
01:50:25,460 --> 01:50:28,460
There's no passion inside to tear you down

1691
01:50:29,460 --> 01:50:31,460
Wherever people are feeling deep

1692
01:50:32,460 --> 01:50:35,460
Better stay out Charlene

1693
01:51:05,460 --> 01:51:11,460
I saw you last night in your fancy outfit

1694
01:51:11,460 --> 01:51:15,460
I'm the man in the dark streets

1695
01:51:15,460 --> 01:51:18,460
That touched your gorgeous body

1696
01:51:18,460 --> 01:51:20,460
Let me be I

1697
01:51:20,460 --> 01:51:23,460
So please take care of yourself

1698
01:51:23,460 --> 01:51:27,460
Don't give away everything you own

1699
01:51:27,460 --> 01:51:30,460
No one will give you back

1700
01:51:30,460 --> 01:51:33,460
You understand that you have fun

1701
01:51:33,460 --> 01:51:38,460
Charlene, you're such a little sister of mine

1702
01:51:38,460 --> 01:51:42,460
Better stay off your drugs and the wine

1703
01:51:42,460 --> 01:51:45,460
Don't get lost in the danger we see

1704
01:51:45,460 --> 01:51:47,460
With you so, Charlene

1705
01:51:47,460 --> 01:51:50,460
Stay out, Charlene

1706
01:51:50,460 --> 01:51:54,460
Just beware of the dark side of town

1707
01:51:54,460 --> 01:51:57,460
There's no passion except to turn you down

1708
01:51:57,460 --> 01:52:00,460
We're the people who are bleeding in need

1709
01:52:00,460 --> 01:52:04,460
You better stay up and join me

1710
01:52:04,460 --> 01:52:06,460
Please don't touch my mane.

1711
01:54:34,460 --> 01:55:01,900
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12

1712
01:55:01,900 --> 01:55:06,900
My soul has come to life, it's just too much I need you

1713
01:55:06,900 --> 01:55:11,900
I need you

1714
01:55:41,900 --> 01:56:06,580
Hello, we're back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1715
01:56:06,580 --> 01:56:11,140
In that break you heard a little bit of Summer Vacation there from 2DX6 style.

1716
01:56:11,140 --> 01:56:15,380
Charlene from In the Groove, because a big part of that last segment we were talking

1717
01:56:15,380 --> 01:56:19,540
to an In the Groove fan who wanted to discuss with Jamie the pros and cons there, and they

1718
01:56:19,540 --> 01:56:22,480
said they liked Charlene and a lot of our chat room likes that song too, so we thought

1719
01:56:22,480 --> 01:56:26,260
we'd nod those folks with that.

1720
01:56:26,260 --> 01:56:30,580
Also V, as requested by our chat room about a gazillion times there, so there you go,

1721
01:56:30,580 --> 01:56:38,620
some V, the perennially hoarded Bamani song on all mixes that that song's ever been in.

1722
01:56:38,620 --> 01:56:43,000
And then Ghosts, which I think a lot of you folks forgot about, but that song was an awesome

1723
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:47,080
song that was in DDR Max and in America Max 2.

1724
01:56:47,080 --> 01:56:49,840
So there you have it in that break.

1725
01:56:49,840 --> 01:56:50,840
Moving on, what's going on?

1726
01:56:50,840 --> 01:56:54,880
Of course we're very little on the music gaming news this week, so we've been kind of scouring

1727
01:56:54,880 --> 01:56:58,360
some other sites, seeing what's kind of going on out there in the world, because you know,

1728
01:56:58,360 --> 01:57:01,700
we can talk about non-gaming things once in a while, yes?

1729
01:57:01,700 --> 01:57:05,400
So one thing I was reading, I thought this was very interesting, this article got slash

1730
01:57:05,400 --> 01:57:06,400
dotted.

1731
01:57:06,400 --> 01:57:13,560
that was posted over on this website, gaminghorizon.com, and it's this article talking about, here's

1732
01:57:13,560 --> 01:57:18,720
all the shit we're sick of at E3. And of course, now, three of the four of us sitting in the

1733
01:57:18,720 --> 01:57:20,840
room right now have been to E3 before. Sorry, bugs.

1734
01:57:20,840 --> 01:57:23,200
I plan on going this year. Are you going to go this year?

1735
01:57:23,200 --> 01:57:25,800
Rad? Well, bug? Get bug to Mike. Look.

1736
01:57:25,800 --> 01:57:29,760
Give me the damn mic. Yes, I do plan on going this year. My roommate

1737
01:57:29,760 --> 01:57:32,000
has gone for the past four years. Oh, right on.

1738
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:36,200
And he just manages to walk right on in. See, you're going to act like you're going

1739
01:57:36,200 --> 01:57:38,420
an ad to the overcrowding, basically, of E3.

1740
01:57:38,420 --> 01:57:39,420
Yes.

1741
01:57:39,420 --> 01:57:40,420
All right, sounds good.

1742
01:57:40,420 --> 01:57:41,420
But I can show people aside.

1743
01:57:41,420 --> 01:57:44,640
What's interesting about this article is it really kind of points out things that are

1744
01:57:44,640 --> 01:57:49,420
wrong with E3, so I'm kind of curious, you know, for you guys, because E3's not that

1745
01:57:49,420 --> 01:57:50,420
far away now.

1746
01:57:50,420 --> 01:57:54,200
I mean, we've got to start thinking now in, you know, January we're going to be going

1747
01:57:54,200 --> 01:57:57,820
and signing up for E3 again, so all that fun stuff.

1748
01:57:57,820 --> 01:58:03,160
The biggest problems they say E3 has, the swagbagger, somebody who goes to the show

1749
01:58:03,160 --> 01:58:06,480
show, just to get the free stuff and sell it on eBay.

1750
01:58:06,480 --> 01:58:10,520
I went for swag my first year. To keep, though. That's different. When you

1751
01:58:10,520 --> 01:58:12,560
keep it for yourself, that's different. And to give away to friends.

1752
01:58:12,560 --> 01:58:16,880
Right. And we've done the giveaways, you know, on the show, too, so. But going to sell is

1753
01:58:16,880 --> 01:58:20,320
not cool. But last year, it was all like, okay, I can't

1754
01:58:20,320 --> 01:58:28,120
carry this crap around. And my goal, my first goal the first year I went was actually for

1755
01:58:28,120 --> 01:58:32,800
media kits. My second year was media kits and getting into media events, which I succeeded

1756
01:58:32,800 --> 01:58:42,080
in? Overpopulation, of course. My god, E3 was so crowded this year, it's not even funny,

1757
01:58:42,080 --> 01:58:52,640
which of course ties back into the food lines, are god-awful at E3. I think next year somebody

1758
01:58:52,640 --> 01:58:57,400
would be really smart to open up a hot dog stand out front. Like 50 of them. Or not just

1759
01:58:57,400 --> 01:59:02,000
hot dog stands, but... Permits! How about a salad... They were chasing off folks with

1760
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:05,780
the hot dog stands because they didn't have permits for sale. That is such BS. Actually

1761
01:59:05,780 --> 01:59:09,820
it's law. Well, I understand it's the law, but come on, you've got all those people packed

1762
01:59:09,820 --> 01:59:13,500
in that tiny building and they're trying to eat for God's sake, and to make them pay ten

1763
01:59:13,500 --> 01:59:19,760
dollars for a hamburger is insane. So, shame on them. Or at least somebody go get a permit

1764
01:59:19,760 --> 01:59:24,060
then and make it legal. Or how about, instead of like hot dog carts, how about a salad cart

1765
01:59:24,060 --> 01:59:27,140
or something healthy for these people, which includes me.

1766
01:59:27,140 --> 01:59:27,940
The fruit cart.

1767
01:59:27,940 --> 01:59:28,580
The fruit cart.

1768
01:59:28,580 --> 01:59:29,660
How about some hot fruit?

1769
01:59:32,260 --> 01:59:33,940
I can't be the only hot fruit at E3.

1770
01:59:33,940 --> 01:59:35,980
Come on.

1771
01:59:35,980 --> 01:59:39,220
Media, media, media, everything is all media-centric,

1772
01:59:39,220 --> 01:59:41,220
which some argue is the way it needs to be.

1773
01:59:41,220 --> 01:59:42,820
Some argue, say, company.

1774
01:59:42,820 --> 01:59:45,100
Of course, the rock star booth this year was shit,

1775
01:59:45,100 --> 01:59:46,420
unless you were in the media.

1776
01:59:46,420 --> 01:59:48,060
You couldn't do anything at that booth,

1777
01:59:48,060 --> 01:59:49,420
unless you were media-oriented.

1778
01:59:49,420 --> 01:59:51,140
Some people say that one day of E3

1779
01:59:51,140 --> 01:59:53,420
needs to be nothing but media.

1780
01:59:53,420 --> 01:59:56,500
be very interesting

1781
01:59:56,500 --> 01:59:59,400
sexploitation of E3

1782
01:59:59,400 --> 02:00:03,100
the fact that it's booth babes, booth babes, booth babes, and then just random

1783
02:00:03,100 --> 02:00:05,260
uh... girls walking around

1784
02:00:05,260 --> 02:00:08,820
nope, very very few booth boys

1785
02:00:08,820 --> 02:00:11,900
very few. Just as barbarians it was great

1786
02:00:11,900 --> 02:00:15,740
well let's face it though, the statistics are that you know

1787
02:00:15,740 --> 02:00:18,100
most of the E3, the bacon dogs were awesome

1788
02:00:18,100 --> 02:00:20,740
most of the E3, that was a random comment

1789
02:00:20,740 --> 02:00:26,900
Most of the E3 is very male-dominated, but at the same time, I see a lot more women.

1790
02:00:26,900 --> 02:00:31,380
There's more women that go to that show than you'd think, you know, so I'm kind of surprised

1791
02:00:31,380 --> 02:00:34,700
they don't have more booth dudes or, you know, whatever you want to call them, booth hunks.

1792
02:00:34,700 --> 02:00:35,700
I don't see anything wrong with that.

1793
02:00:35,700 --> 02:00:36,700
I couldn't interview by IGN.

1794
02:00:36,700 --> 02:00:37,700
What?

1795
02:00:37,700 --> 02:00:38,700
I couldn't interview by IGN.

1796
02:00:38,700 --> 02:00:39,700
As, like, a gamer girl, right?

1797
02:00:39,700 --> 02:00:40,700
As a gamer girl.

1798
02:00:40,700 --> 02:00:41,700
Yeah.

1799
02:00:41,700 --> 02:00:42,700
I was like, do you consider yourself a gamer girl?

1800
02:00:42,700 --> 02:00:43,700
No, I only host internet radio about video games.

1801
02:00:43,700 --> 02:00:50,700
like, do you consider yourself a gamer girl? No, I only host internet radio about video

1802
02:00:50,700 --> 02:00:57,540
games. I'm sorry, you're not a true gaming girl, you have not licked a PSV. Huh? You

1803
02:00:57,540 --> 02:01:03,740
know, the licking the PSV? I am older school than old school. Oh, forget it. Um, people

1804
02:01:03,740 --> 02:01:10,700
that camp and play the demos all day long. Well, I realize this, but I'm talking about

1805
02:01:10,700 --> 02:01:15,700
like the one particular demo, like, what's a game that people were doing this on at this

1806
02:01:15,700 --> 02:01:19,980
year's E3 that people would just not get off those damn demos no matter what? Not really

1807
02:01:19,980 --> 02:01:24,040
so much Katamari, actually. The way the Katamari demo was set up, it was very hard to camp

1808
02:01:24,040 --> 02:01:28,420
that demo. What was, I'm trying to think of a demo that was really badly camped. Soul

1809
02:01:28,420 --> 02:01:34,580
Calibur III was pretty bad. So, I don't know. There's other ones, too. Well, in the year

1810
02:01:34,580 --> 02:01:43,500
before that, even though I would say probably Contra, the Contra game, and oh, I don't remember

1811
02:01:43,500 --> 02:01:46,820
the other one now.

1812
02:01:46,820 --> 02:01:53,300
Cattle prods and timed electrical pulses will, although some people might get to like that.

1813
02:01:53,300 --> 02:01:59,380
Shuttle delays, so it makes it very hard to get to the damn show, I agree with that one.

1814
02:01:59,380 --> 02:02:04,180
The sound, the fact that the sound is very, very loud there.

1815
02:02:04,180 --> 02:02:07,440
you ever been to any other type of conference? I got to touch the katamari and that made

1816
02:02:07,440 --> 02:02:11,280
me happy. The fact that the lines are incredibly long

1817
02:02:11,280 --> 02:02:18,280
and you never really necessarily know what they're for, in some cases, and sometimes

1818
02:02:18,280 --> 02:02:23,320
the lines are to just walk through a room. The article says the line at Nintendo is for

1819
02:02:23,320 --> 02:02:27,560
a screening at Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess. They'd just shown the trailer at the press

1820
02:02:27,560 --> 02:02:32,040
conference the day before. And then the line at Sony was to walk through

1821
02:02:32,040 --> 02:02:38,080
a room where they had hallow models of the PlayStation 3 design behind glass, two days

1822
02:02:38,080 --> 02:02:40,880
before they'd released high-res images of the system anyway.

1823
02:02:40,880 --> 02:02:42,800
Were you supposed to kneel down in reverence?

1824
02:02:42,800 --> 02:02:43,800
Maybe.

1825
02:02:43,800 --> 02:02:49,880
Hey, I'm not going to say anything because we had those pictures up as soon as we were

1826
02:02:49,880 --> 02:02:50,880
back.

1827
02:02:50,880 --> 02:02:54,080
Here's their suggestions, and then we'll wrap this up and get into other segments here because

1828
02:02:54,080 --> 02:02:57,600
I know maybe some people are like, well, what the hell do I care?

1829
02:02:57,600 --> 02:02:58,600
I don't get to go to E3.

1830
02:02:58,600 --> 02:02:59,600
Huh?

1831
02:02:59,600 --> 02:03:00,600
I know.

1832
02:03:00,600 --> 02:03:01,600
We'll get to that.

1833
02:03:01,600 --> 02:03:05,520
Um, suggestions on how to make E3 better.

1834
02:03:05,520 --> 02:03:09,480
Tighten the entrance requirements.

1835
02:03:09,480 --> 02:03:13,520
It's saying if you work at a Hollywood video store, um, you shouldn't be coming in.

1836
02:03:13,520 --> 02:03:16,440
If you draw an online comic strip, you shouldn't be coming in.

1837
02:03:16,440 --> 02:03:21,080
If you come to, if you're from blogger.com and you occasionally talk about games, you

1838
02:03:21,080 --> 02:03:23,600
shouldn't be coming in.

1839
02:03:23,600 --> 02:03:28,800
If you just really want to get into E3 because you want to play upcoming games, you're part

1840
02:03:28,800 --> 02:03:31,520
of the problem, says this site.

1841
02:03:31,520 --> 02:03:35,520
I'm not sure if that's the best way to phrase it.

1842
02:03:35,520 --> 02:03:41,520
If you work at Target in the Garden Department, just because Target carries games, you shouldn't be going to E3.

1843
02:03:41,520 --> 02:03:47,520
I think you have to play the upcoming games. You can tell other people about them. So, yes, that is part of the reason why you play.

1844
02:03:47,520 --> 02:03:54,520
A media-only day. I don't know if that's the answer. I think the media gets too much favoritism as it is.

1845
02:03:54,520 --> 02:03:57,520
If they would just tighten up who they let in in the general.

1846
02:03:57,520 --> 02:04:02,800
Yeah, but the media, the hype that the media generates is part of what sells the games.

1847
02:04:02,800 --> 02:04:04,840
I understand that, but I just...

1848
02:04:04,840 --> 02:04:11,760
Part of what, you know, you've got to cater to the fan base, but it is a media event.

1849
02:04:11,760 --> 02:04:12,760
It is an industry event.

1850
02:04:12,760 --> 02:04:14,560
It's an industry event, not a media event.

1851
02:04:14,560 --> 02:04:15,560
There's a difference.

1852
02:04:15,560 --> 02:04:16,560
It's an industry event.

1853
02:04:16,560 --> 02:04:17,560
But I do think the media should get different.

1854
02:04:17,560 --> 02:04:22,960
They're the ones who are actually reporting on it, they should be getting the information

1855
02:04:22,960 --> 02:04:24,720
before the average consumer.

1856
02:04:24,720 --> 02:04:27,720
What about, like, a manager of a GameStop who's not the media?

1857
02:04:27,720 --> 02:04:31,220
Then they need to be shown some credentials. I think that they should get into that too.

1858
02:04:31,220 --> 02:04:37,720
But I was saying, the average, you know, GameStop employee, the average Target employee,

1859
02:04:37,720 --> 02:04:43,220
the people who do a webcomic, you know, if you, I think if you report on it,

1860
02:04:43,220 --> 02:04:49,720
or if you are in charge of a group that is selling it, then you should be allowed to.

1861
02:04:49,720 --> 02:04:53,720
And maybe not even the managers as much. Maybe it should be, like, the district managers,

1862
02:04:53,720 --> 02:04:55,800
marketing people for companies

1863
02:04:55,800 --> 02:04:59,200
uh... less babes more games

1864
02:04:59,200 --> 02:05:02,600
so i don't know about that one some some some guys might have a problem with that

1865
02:05:02,600 --> 02:05:06,920
i like babes uh... streamline the press conferences

1866
02:05:06,920 --> 02:05:09,920
uh... the one thing about the the press they were saying is no love for the

1867
02:05:09,920 --> 02:05:12,040
small press like

1868
02:05:12,040 --> 02:05:13,800
uh... because she for

1869
02:05:13,800 --> 02:05:19,200
and i g n and gary like five thousand people doing a whore out everything and

1870
02:05:19,200 --> 02:05:24,640
It's like, you know, Joe Bob, who actually has, you know, a website that's pretty popular,

1871
02:05:24,640 --> 02:05:29,560
but not as popular as these, can't get into anything because they're being hoarded out.

1872
02:05:29,560 --> 02:05:34,440
It's like, who are you? We don't know who you are, so fuck off, you know.

1873
02:05:34,440 --> 02:05:39,000
And no behind closed doors only content. I have to agree with that one.

1874
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:42,560
I agree with that. That's a bunch of crap, keeping the stuff behind closed doors. Just

1875
02:05:42,560 --> 02:05:45,560
don't show it at all.

1876
02:05:45,560 --> 02:05:47,560
And some of this isn't even very special.

1877
02:05:47,560 --> 02:05:50,120
Fix the demo camper problem.

1878
02:05:50,120 --> 02:05:52,440
Just have those demos reset after like three minutes,

1879
02:05:52,440 --> 02:05:53,280
or say, time's up.

1880
02:05:53,280 --> 02:05:55,160
Get off my game.

1881
02:05:55,160 --> 02:05:57,040
Watch the volume.

1882
02:05:57,040 --> 02:06:00,520
Figure out what's secret and what's public.

1883
02:06:00,520 --> 02:06:04,320
Have operational press sites running alongside the show.

1884
02:06:04,320 --> 02:06:05,440
That's kind of interesting.

1885
02:06:05,440 --> 02:06:07,760
And the last one, which I think is very interesting,

1886
02:06:07,760 --> 02:06:10,640
have an East Coast show.

1887
02:06:10,640 --> 02:06:11,840
No.

1888
02:06:11,840 --> 02:06:19,960
Actually, I thought that Microsoft did their Xbox 360 demo very intelligently, got a ticket.

1889
02:06:19,960 --> 02:06:23,000
You go up, get your ticket, you come back at the time for the ticket, and they let you

1890
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:24,000
in.

1891
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:25,000
That's like Squeenix's thing.

1892
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:26,000
Squeenix's little joke.

1893
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:27,000
Yeah, that was pretty smart, too.

1894
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:32,360
I mean, I think it was very, you know, although you do have to, you know, wait for your turn,

1895
02:06:32,360 --> 02:06:34,800
but it prevents them from being the insane line.

1896
02:06:34,800 --> 02:06:40,440
Okay, it did actually prevent the line at Squeenix, but it did prevent the lines for

1897
02:06:40,440 --> 02:06:45,560
the 360, you had your line formed at the time it was to let them in.

1898
02:06:45,560 --> 02:06:47,440
You get inside, no more line.

1899
02:06:47,440 --> 02:06:49,360
You don't have to worry about the congestion of people.

1900
02:06:49,360 --> 02:06:50,360
It was very smart.

1901
02:06:50,360 --> 02:06:54,960
They should, you know, I even think that they should have, this is like what they do with

1902
02:06:54,960 --> 02:07:00,900
Anime Expo, you know, if you're staying in the convention center hotels or the ones associated

1903
02:07:00,900 --> 02:07:06,280
with the convention, then as part of, you know, you can go pick up a ticket when you

1904
02:07:06,280 --> 02:07:09,180
prove that you're staying at one of these places or you know because that's

1905
02:07:09,180 --> 02:07:13,240
that'll be no general a little bit more money for both the hotel and you know

1906
02:07:13,240 --> 02:07:18,760
and for the convention itself but it also prevents you know there from being

1907
02:07:18,760 --> 02:07:24,160
huge congested amounts of people if you have your ticket sales done in a more

1908
02:07:24,160 --> 02:07:29,440
out-of-the-way location um a lot of our chat room really big on the East Coast

1909
02:07:29,440 --> 02:07:34,680
idea I think somebody I think because of e3 getting overcrowded and over kind of

1910
02:07:34,680 --> 02:07:38,960
bloated in a way. I think some of these East Coast shows are starting to pick up the slack

1911
02:07:38,960 --> 02:07:42,080
a little bit, just naturally. Like, people are calling this digital life show that's

1912
02:07:42,080 --> 02:07:45,880
coming up the East Coast E3, and that's just kind of a natural evolution.

1913
02:07:45,880 --> 02:07:51,080
There are very few, as far as I know, there aren't as many game companies out on the East

1914
02:07:51,080 --> 02:07:54,280
Coast as there are on the West Coast. That's very true.

1915
02:07:54,280 --> 02:08:00,160
And it's significantly easier for, you know, basically LA is a local show for everyone

1916
02:08:00,160 --> 02:08:01,240
in

1917
02:08:01,240 --> 02:08:04,600
uh... but most of them are in the bay well not my i guess maybe not only

1918
02:08:04,600 --> 02:08:08,160
has only four hours that's better than four days this is true of having to

1919
02:08:08,160 --> 02:08:11,640
transport stuff four hours you know you can go home for a day take you know if

1920
02:08:11,640 --> 02:08:12,800
you're flying

1921
02:08:12,800 --> 02:08:16,800
you know what you can go down and and up every morning if you have to

1922
02:08:16,800 --> 02:08:19,720
all right we're gonna move on uh... real quick well

1923
02:08:19,720 --> 02:08:21,600
shoot i just got my keyboard that's no fun

1924
02:08:21,600 --> 02:08:23,920
all right real quick though um... topping

1925
02:08:23,920 --> 02:08:27,480
i thought it was part of this top thing that you think could be improved about

1926
02:08:27,480 --> 02:08:28,480
E3.

1927
02:08:28,480 --> 02:08:29,480
Loki.

1928
02:08:29,480 --> 02:08:32,440
Top thing that you think could be improved about E3.

1929
02:08:32,440 --> 02:08:35,240
Get rid of the retarded people that shouldn't be there.

1930
02:08:35,240 --> 02:08:37,520
And let me into the goddamn Rockstar booth.

1931
02:08:37,520 --> 02:08:41,440
Fuck, and they teased me the first time with Grand Theft Auto, and then they teased me

1932
02:08:41,440 --> 02:08:43,080
again with these stupid buses.

1933
02:08:43,080 --> 02:08:44,320
The hell with them.

1934
02:08:44,320 --> 02:08:47,320
Dark Sakura.

1935
02:08:47,320 --> 02:08:48,320
Thank you.

1936
02:08:48,320 --> 02:08:50,700
Uh, more food vendors is my thing.

1937
02:08:50,700 --> 02:08:51,700
More food vendors.

1938
02:08:51,700 --> 02:08:54,400
That is completely stupid that I'm losing, like, an hour and a half of playing game time

1939
02:08:54,400 --> 02:08:55,720
because I'm standing in line for food.

1940
02:08:55,720 --> 02:08:56,720
That's awful.

1941
02:08:56,720 --> 02:09:00,720
I seriously need to stop being run into by famous people.

1942
02:09:00,720 --> 02:09:02,720
And closed door stuff should not...

1943
02:09:02,720 --> 02:09:06,720
That's not the reason you're there. You're there to show stuff, not show stuff.

1944
02:09:06,720 --> 02:09:10,720
But it's supposed to build the excitement about it by making it some secret deal.

1945
02:09:10,720 --> 02:09:13,720
The biggest problem with E3 is they let Sinbad in.

1946
02:09:13,720 --> 02:09:14,720
And Gary Coleman, what's up with that?

1947
02:09:14,720 --> 02:09:18,720
Hey, John Cena was there last year, and he's pretty hot.

1948
02:09:18,720 --> 02:09:23,720
All right, kids, we're going to get into the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match, or we're going to run out of time.

1949
02:09:23,720 --> 02:09:26,620
The way the cage match works is that we play three songs for you guys.

1950
02:09:26,620 --> 02:09:30,460
We play a clip of the song that won last week, and then two new songs, each host of course

1951
02:09:30,460 --> 02:09:32,220
bringing one song to the table.

1952
02:09:32,220 --> 02:09:33,420
You guys vote on your favorite.

1953
02:09:33,420 --> 02:09:37,380
The winning song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's Bomani and Video

1954
02:09:37,380 --> 02:09:41,080
Game Music program, which plays 24 hours a day, 7 days a week on the station.

1955
02:09:41,080 --> 02:09:42,900
We are not live.

1956
02:09:42,900 --> 02:09:46,700
Starting it off tonight is last week's winner, now going for its third win, I believe, if

1957
02:09:46,700 --> 02:09:48,260
I'm not mistaken.

1958
02:09:48,260 --> 02:09:49,980
It's something Loki picked a while back.

1959
02:09:49,980 --> 02:09:53,660
It's a remix of V by Dorisia.

1960
02:09:53,660 --> 02:09:58,140
the artist so it's one for the past two weeks will it win again tonight I just

1961
02:09:58,140 --> 02:10:02,500
don't know we'll find out here it is song number one tonight a clip of last

1962
02:10:02,500 --> 02:10:04,500
last week's winner, Thee.

1963
02:11:32,500 --> 02:11:45,580
I turned the mics back on, right as you yawned, which was-

1964
02:11:45,580 --> 02:11:46,580
I didn't have a-

1965
02:11:46,580 --> 02:11:47,580
No, I was-

1966
02:11:47,580 --> 02:11:48,580
Did I sleep?

1967
02:11:48,580 --> 02:11:49,580
You're cutting out.

1968
02:11:49,580 --> 02:11:51,580
I don't know what the hell's wrong with the cord there.

1969
02:11:51,580 --> 02:11:52,580
Yo!

1970
02:11:52,580 --> 02:11:53,580
There you are.

1971
02:11:53,580 --> 02:11:54,580
All right.

1972
02:11:54,580 --> 02:11:55,580
I was just- I was just being lulled to sleep.

1973
02:11:55,580 --> 02:11:56,580
All right.

1974
02:11:56,580 --> 02:11:59,620
That was song one, Dorisio with V. Will it win for the third week in a row?

1975
02:11:59,620 --> 02:12:00,620
We'll find out.

1976
02:12:00,620 --> 02:12:08,000
doing challenging it tonight the first one is my pick and I haven't won the

1977
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:13,060
cage match in like three months seriously I have not won the cage

1978
02:12:13,060 --> 02:12:16,180
match in three months so I decided tonight I just wasn't gonna pick a song

1979
02:12:16,180 --> 02:12:21,300
so I let somebody else pick a song for me so and and and Miklotov's been

1980
02:12:21,300 --> 02:12:24,180
begging and begging me for like two months or something to let him put a

1981
02:12:24,180 --> 02:12:28,780
song in so here you go and I swear to God Miklotov if this song loses you

1982
02:12:28,780 --> 02:12:33,020
never get another one in here no I'm just kidding but here it is this is a

1983
02:12:33,020 --> 02:12:38,460
song by a group called pendulum and the song is called hold your color so we'll

1984
02:12:38,460 --> 02:12:39,460
We'll see what you guys think.

1985
02:12:39,460 --> 02:12:41,460
Here it is, song number two.

1986
02:13:09,460 --> 02:13:33,300
When they take everything away Hold your colors against the wall

1987
02:14:33,300 --> 02:14:39,940
Hold your guns against the wall

1988
02:14:39,940 --> 02:14:45,620
And they take everything away

1989
02:14:45,620 --> 02:14:54,260
Hold your guns against the wall

1990
02:14:54,260 --> 02:15:21,260
I just want you to look into your eyes

1991
02:15:21,260 --> 02:15:23,260
So I lay the name

1992
02:15:23,260 --> 02:15:26,260
Don't try to save yourself

1993
02:15:26,260 --> 02:15:29,260
This circle is complete

1994
02:15:29,260 --> 02:15:33,260
Reaching out and to save you

1995
02:15:33,260 --> 02:15:38,260
Nothing else can touch me

1996
02:15:38,260 --> 02:15:41,260
So can't turn back now

1997
02:15:41,260 --> 02:15:45,260
To cut us against the wall

1998
02:15:45,260 --> 02:15:51,260
When they take everything away

1999
02:15:51,260 --> 02:15:58,260
I want you guys to get to know

2000
02:15:58,260 --> 02:16:00,260
I want you guys to get to know

2001
02:16:00,260 --> 02:16:05,260
So I can see

2002
02:16:05,260 --> 02:16:08,260
Open your eyes, twist and deny

2003
02:16:08,260 --> 02:16:10,260
Open your eyes, twist and deny

2004
02:16:10,260 --> 02:16:12,260
Open your eyes

2005
02:16:12,260 --> 02:16:18,260
She looked into your eyes and saw what lay beneath

2006
02:16:18,260 --> 02:16:23,260
Don't try to save yourself, the circle is complete

2007
02:16:53,260 --> 02:16:57,260
Starting out to show it all

2008
02:16:57,260 --> 02:17:02,260
When I'm reaching out, I do see you

2009
02:17:02,260 --> 02:17:07,260
Nothing else can touch me

2010
02:17:07,260 --> 02:17:09,260
So can I

2011
02:17:09,260 --> 02:17:14,260
Come to girls against the rules

2012
02:17:14,260 --> 02:17:20,260
When they take everything away

2013
02:17:20,260 --> 02:17:28,900
I'm too close to get to be wrong

2014
02:17:28,900 --> 02:17:37,380
I'm too close, I'm too close, I'm too close to get to be wrong

2015
02:17:37,380 --> 02:17:42,260
Take everything out of your way

2016
02:17:42,260 --> 02:17:45,400
Is it good? Is it good?

2017
02:17:45,400 --> 02:17:50,100
In your eyes

2018
02:17:50,100 --> 02:17:52,540
I'll know you're gonna say

2019
02:17:53,660 --> 02:18:03,460
Don't open your eyes, don't represented the knife

2020
02:18:07,960 --> 02:18:10,820
On our tune tonight skagematch pendulum

2021
02:18:10,820 --> 02:18:12,820
Hold your color.

2022
02:18:12,820 --> 02:18:14,820
We're not going to hold back our thoughts any longer.

2023
02:18:14,820 --> 02:18:16,820
What do you guys think of that? Dark Sakura?

2024
02:18:16,820 --> 02:18:18,820
Um...

2025
02:18:18,820 --> 02:18:20,820
I like it a lot.

2026
02:18:20,820 --> 02:18:23,820
I just felt it was a little long and got a little repetitive.

2027
02:18:23,820 --> 02:18:26,820
But I really do like the song a lot, so it gets an 8.5.

2028
02:18:26,820 --> 02:18:27,820
Low-key.

2029
02:18:27,820 --> 02:18:29,820
I like the beginning of it, then it just kind of...

2030
02:18:29,820 --> 02:18:31,820
I don't know.

2031
02:18:31,820 --> 02:18:33,820
It drops off in my interest, I guess.

2032
02:18:33,820 --> 02:18:35,820
Um, so 9.

2033
02:18:35,820 --> 02:18:37,820
Bugged.

2034
02:18:37,820 --> 02:18:39,820
Good driving song?

2035
02:18:39,820 --> 02:18:48,820
I like that song more this time than the first time I heard it. I actually liked it a lot more this time, so I don't know what happened. I guess I was just in a crabby mood the other night.

2036
02:18:48,820 --> 02:18:56,820
But I liked it, it was cool, but I agree, it kind of went on a little long, so if it had been like three minutes, it would have been cool. Five minutes, a little much.

2037
02:18:56,820 --> 02:19:00,820
So I give it an eight and a half.

2038
02:19:00,820 --> 02:19:06,820
Alright, song number three, Dark Sakura's pick. One more for you guys. Dark Sakura, what'd you pick first tonight?

2039
02:19:06,820 --> 02:19:13,820
It's off the new M-Flow album, it's M-Flow Loves Benny K's Taste Your Stuff.

2040
02:19:13,820 --> 02:19:15,820
Some M-Flow tonight.

2041
02:19:15,820 --> 02:19:17,820
Yep, new M-Flow.

2042
02:19:17,820 --> 02:19:18,820
Alright, new M-Flow.

2043
02:19:18,820 --> 02:19:24,180

2044

Let's get out of here, oh no, ooh yeah You know I had enough of this baby, oh no, ooh yeah

2047
02:20:24,740 --> 02:20:27,940
We could have been on a half-speed ride

2048
02:20:43,240 --> 02:20:45,240
No one will say, no one will throw you

2049
02:20:45,240 --> 02:20:46,740
But I'm just down to pay

2050
02:20:46,740 --> 02:20:47,740

02:20:47,740 --> 02:20:48,740

I gotta get out, get out

2054
02:20:51,740 --> 02:20:52,740

Mada, mada, damn

02:21:06,980 --> 02:21:07,980
That's how we do

2065
02:21:07,980 --> 02:21:09,980
It's more interesting to give it

2066
02:21:09,980 --> 02:21:10,980
So much in front of you

2067
02:21:10,980 --> 02:21:11,980
Very strong, but can't you

2068
02:21:11,980 --> 02:21:12,980
Just communicate

2069
02:21:12,980 --> 02:21:13,980
Show, start though

2070
02:21:13,980 --> 02:21:14,980
Uh-huh

2071
02:21:14,980 --> 02:21:15,980
We got the coffee

2072
02:21:15,980 --> 02:21:16,980
Can't be so heat

2073
02:21:16,980 --> 02:21:17,980
No small heat

2074
02:21:17,980 --> 02:21:19,980
So now why can't I change the real story?

2075
02:21:19,980 --> 02:21:20,980
I'm gonna meet you another showman

2076

And I'm home now, just leaving back in yesterday

2080
02:21:46,980 --> 02:21:47,980
What? Hey, you don't wanna start this again?

2081
02:21:47,980 --> 02:21:48,980
Well, what again?

2082
02:21:48,980 --> 02:21:49,980
That's my style.

2083
02:21:49,980 --> 02:21:50,980
Man, we're gonna see a Taurus, though.

2084
02:21:50,980 --> 02:21:51,980
Too bad.

2085
02:21:51,980 --> 02:21:52,980
You don't even wanna hear it.

02:21:52,980 --> 02:21:53,980
You'll be a 10.

Okay, so it's song number three in tonight's cage match.

M. Flo loves Benny K with Taste Your Stuff.

2132
02:23:35,980 --> 02:23:37,980
Very interesting name for a song there.

2133
02:23:37,980 --> 02:23:40,980
Let's see, did that leave a good taste or a bad taste in your mouth?

2134
02:23:40,980 --> 02:23:41,980
Dark Sakura.

2135
02:23:41,980 --> 02:23:43,980
M. Flo can do no wrong ten.

2136
02:24:13,980 --> 02:24:18,940
a porno beat to it which is kind of cool so I give it like a eight and a half

2137
02:24:18,940 --> 02:24:23,060
maybe nine I could be I could be talked into a nine eight and a half though for

2138
02:24:23,060 --> 02:24:26,900

2146
02:25:24,500 --> 02:25:28,560
as a vote, although, you know, you may sway some other people, but I'm not encouraging

2147
02:25:28,560 --> 02:25:30,080
you people to, uh, start flooding.

2148
02:25:30,080 --> 02:25:31,920
Okay, the next person to type V.

2149
02:25:31,920 --> 02:25:32,920
No flooding.

2150
02:25:32,920 --> 02:25:38,440
Well, now you have to allow them to campaign for a song they might want, but, you know,

2151
02:25:38,440 --> 02:25:39,440
no flooding.

2152
02:25:39,440 --> 02:25:41,440
Yeah, the next person to type V.

2153
02:25:41,440 --> 02:25:42,440
Yeah, don't flood.

2154
02:25:42,440 --> 02:25:44,340
All right, so there you go.

2155
02:25:44,340 --> 02:25:46,580
Have fun arguing about that.

2156
02:25:46,580 --> 02:25:51,520

2194
02:27:57,780 --> 02:28:02,020
which i i i i am i have thought there for not picking bromani songs and

2195
02:28:02,020 --> 02:28:04,360
making steps for them like i think i got it

2196
02:28:04,360 --> 02:28:08,060
bump down if you did something like that or something that because i was sick of

2197
02:28:08,060 --> 02:28:11,300
seeing those so that is although it sounds like a budget dance mania speed

2198
02:28:11,300 --> 02:28:14,120
songs are in there

2199
02:28:14,120 --> 02:28:15,680
What can he do?

2200
02:28:15,680 --> 02:28:19,960
Everybody loves their speed music. Man, of course I'm getting corrected in the chat room, it's not a Smile DK song.

2201
02:28:19,960 --> 02:28:22,700
Where the hell have I heard that name before?

2202
02:28:22,700 --> 02:28:25,640
Ding Ding Dong. I know I've heard that song name before.

2203
02:28:25,640 --> 02:28:29,880
Like, it's on a DanceMania CD, I could swear.

2204
02:28:29,880 --> 02:28:31,960
Oh well. I don't care.

2205
02:28:31,960 --> 02:28:34,560
Are we looking? Alright.

2206
02:28:34,560 --> 02:28:38,320
I wanted to play this for you guys. I feel like going to a Taiko parade all of a sudden.

2207
02:28:38,320 --> 02:28:42,400
I know, he's still at it. Extrofer is still playing Taiko. You know what's funny?

2208
02:28:42,400 --> 02:28:46,060
he bought the game at like five o'clock today okay he already has told me he's

2209
02:28:46,060 --> 02:28:49,220
beat the game on easy which means he's played every song in the game on easy

2210
02:28:49,220 --> 02:28:54,660
mode now and now he's going back through a normal mode well it's a damn good

2211
02:28:54,660 --> 02:28:57,700
thing we don't have people living downstairs now they moved out the

2212
02:28:57,700 --> 02:29:03,400
British soccer players moved out I know I know you said I want to play this for

2213
02:29:03,400 --> 02:29:07,120
you guys this is an a cappella version of injection of love I think this is

2214
02:29:07,120 --> 02:29:11,180
very interesting because what somebody did out there on one of the forums is

2215
02:29:11,180 --> 02:29:15,900
that they took, um, and somebody, somebody, uh, Sakarina said this to me, so I can't remember

2216
02:29:15,900 --> 02:29:19,820
where this came from, so sorry to whoever created this, but somebody took the instrumental

2217
02:29:19,820 --> 02:29:25,940
version that's in Dance Dance Revolution Extreme 2 and cancelled that, or used that to cancel

2218
02:29:25,940 --> 02:29:30,200
out that same noise in the 2DX Red version of the song, so they used that to strip it

2219
02:29:30,200 --> 02:29:34,980
out, like cancel the noise. So what you're left with is Sana's vocals. So you should

2220
02:29:34,980 --> 02:29:40,700
be able to hear nice and clear exactly what the woman's saying in this song. So we're

2221
02:29:40,700 --> 02:29:46,700
gonna hear that part and I think she's supposed to say um stroke me she's

2222
02:29:46,700 --> 02:29:51,900
supposed to say stroke me but I swear to God she says fuck me so we're gonna

2223
02:29:51,900 --> 02:29:54,060
listen right now to a little bit of acapella here

2224
02:29:54,060 --> 02:29:58,340
sauna injection of love so you can actually kind of hear the little Feds

2225
02:29:58,340 --> 02:30:12,340
there in the background, so let's see if we can get into the...

2226
02:30:12,340 --> 02:30:17,340
You can hear little bits of the music in there because the cancellation is not perfect.

2227
02:30:17,340 --> 02:30:24,300
It sounds like playing a record backwards, doesn't it?

2228
02:30:24,300 --> 02:30:28,300
Here it is.

2229
02:30:28,300 --> 02:30:42,700
When you hear it like that, it doesn't sound like fuck so much, but it definitely sounds

2230
02:30:42,700 --> 02:30:44,700
like froke me.

2231
02:30:44,700 --> 02:30:46,700
Gently stroke me.

2232
02:30:46,700 --> 02:30:50,700
Now you can kind of hear the stroke me a little bit when somebody puts it that way.

2233
02:30:50,700 --> 02:30:54,700
But I swear to God it sounds like fuck in the original. It really, really does.

2234
02:30:54,700 --> 02:30:58,700
She must not like it very rough if she's going Yasashi.

2235
02:30:58,700 --> 02:31:00,700
One more time. Here it is.

2236
02:31:04,700 --> 02:31:06,700
I think it's like froke me.

2237
02:31:06,700 --> 02:31:10,700
How do you froke somebody?

2238
02:31:10,700 --> 02:31:17,780
think about this it would if it were written out in katakana it would be

2239
02:31:17,780 --> 02:31:29,860
sturoku so try saying suturo really fast and see how it comes out fuck me

2240
02:31:29,860 --> 02:31:35,780
wow you're right seriously if you if you listen to that part again and listen to

2241
02:31:35,780 --> 02:31:44,340
it as if the whole str little cluster there is actually three syllables what

2242
02:31:44,340 --> 02:31:51,060
is there to stroke on her maybe her breasts and she wants it gently whatever

2243
02:31:51,060 --> 02:31:58,600
I know what broke you and broke you and does she have a penis no I mean I'd not

2244
02:31:58,600 --> 02:32:04,420
as far as I know no oh can you stroke a vagina look if you could oh god please

2245
02:32:04,420 --> 02:32:10,420
You can't really do that, unless there's some really abnormalities and we're not going to go there.

2246
02:32:10,420 --> 02:32:15,420
But, um, yeah, um, I don't think so.

2247
02:32:15,420 --> 02:32:17,420
Alright.

2248
02:32:17,420 --> 02:32:18,420
I don't...

2249
02:32:18,420 --> 02:32:21,420
Seriously, play, but I'm for serious, play one more time.

2250
02:32:21,420 --> 02:32:24,420
Isn't the clitoris, like, just another version of a penis?

2251
02:32:24,420 --> 02:32:25,420
You know what?

2252
02:32:25,420 --> 02:32:27,420
Never mind.

2253
02:32:27,420 --> 02:32:29,420
I'll just let that spot answer.

2254
02:32:29,420 --> 02:32:31,420
This is why you're gay.

2255
02:32:31,420 --> 02:32:32,420
Just stay gay.

2256
02:32:32,420 --> 02:32:35,420
Just stay gay. Don't try to do things that are outside your-

2257
02:32:35,420 --> 02:32:40,420
Curiosity is bad. Curiosity led to the founding of countries.

2258
02:32:40,420 --> 02:32:41,420
No, you're not getting the mic. Go back.

2259
02:32:41,420 --> 02:32:42,420
Do they have a flag?

2260
02:32:46,420 --> 02:32:47,420
Alright, here. Hold on.

2261
02:32:47,420 --> 02:32:48,420
No flag, no country. You can't have one.

2262
02:32:48,420 --> 02:32:51,420
Jamie was here one more time and then I swear to God we're dropping this subject forever.

2263
02:32:53,420 --> 02:32:54,420
Alright, let's see. Here we go.

2264
02:32:58,420 --> 02:32:59,420
See?

2265
02:32:59,420 --> 02:33:02,420
If you listen to it with that in mind.

2266
02:33:02,420 --> 02:33:09,420
But then again, you also broke off. Here's what we gotta say also. That's not going to rip her voice exactly how it was.

2267
02:33:09,420 --> 02:33:11,420
It could have ripped off part of the voice.

2268
02:33:11,420 --> 02:33:13,420
It didn't rip her voice. It ripped everything else out.

2269
02:33:13,420 --> 02:33:18,420
Well, it might not have worked just perfectly, because I know when I try to take vocals out of stuff, sometimes you hear echoes in the background.

2270
02:33:18,420 --> 02:33:21,420
You know what? We could actually run it through our computers and see what happens.

2271
02:33:21,420 --> 02:33:25,420
Let's try doing this. We're going to, let me open up the file here.

2272
02:33:25,420 --> 02:33:31,300
and then I'm gonna make some changes to it and just kind of you know do the

2273
02:33:31,300 --> 02:33:35,500
cancellation thing and let's see what it sounds like this time let's let's let's

2274
02:33:35,500 --> 02:33:39,020
listen to our version of it

2275
02:33:39,020 --> 02:34:07,740
the original was doctored I think we should go to a break now oh wait

2276
02:34:07,740 --> 02:34:08,740
Not before we get-

2277
02:34:08,740 --> 02:34:09,740
Remember!

2278
02:34:09,740 --> 02:34:10,740
What?

2279
02:34:10,740 --> 02:34:11,740
Bleached katamari.

2280
02:34:11,740 --> 02:34:12,740
Yeah, yeah, I know.

2281
02:34:12,740 --> 02:34:13,740
Bleached katamari?

2282
02:34:13,740 --> 02:34:15,500
Just, just, don't encourage the-

2283
02:34:15,500 --> 02:34:17,060
Have I been out of the room too long?

2284
02:34:17,060 --> 02:34:18,060
You have, you have.

2285
02:34:18,060 --> 02:34:19,060
Oh.

2286
02:34:19,060 --> 02:34:23,260
Um, but Extrofer, you're back just in time, because I'll be damned if we miss this.

2287
02:34:23,260 --> 02:34:24,940
Please don't play the gay music.

2288
02:34:24,940 --> 02:34:25,940
You get the gay music.

2289
02:34:25,940 --> 02:34:29,100
I don't get the- I don't want the gay music.

2290
02:34:29,100 --> 02:34:31,980
We need Extrofer's movie reveal.

2291
02:34:31,980 --> 02:34:32,980
Extrofer-

2292
02:34:32,980 --> 02:34:33,980
I need to choose the music for that.

2293
02:34:33,980 --> 02:34:34,980
No.

2294
02:34:34,980 --> 02:34:35,980
Extrofer.

2295
02:34:35,980 --> 02:34:36,980
Oh.

2296
02:34:36,980 --> 02:34:40,980
Well, I saw In Her Shoes yesterday.

2297
02:34:40,980 --> 02:34:42,980
Isn't that a chick flick?

2298
02:34:42,980 --> 02:34:44,980
It is not a chick flick.

2299
02:34:44,980 --> 02:34:47,980
Well, it's a chick flick for gay guys.

2300
02:34:47,980 --> 02:34:51,980
Does that make it a dick flick?

2301
02:34:51,980 --> 02:34:54,980
It makes it a dick flick. It makes it a cock flick.

2302
02:34:54,980 --> 02:34:56,980
So it's like Sex and the City.

2303
02:34:56,980 --> 02:35:04,980
No, it's actually a movie about two sisters who go through some life-altering changes

2304
02:35:04,980 --> 02:35:10,020
changes and how they kind of like come together but like it's a good movie if

2305
02:35:10,020 --> 02:35:14,500
you're ever in the process of like you know unfortunately sometimes in your

2306
02:35:14,500 --> 02:35:17,860
life you lose you may lose friends or you may be in the process of losing

2307
02:35:17,860 --> 02:35:22,980
friends and it's it's a good movie to have to see when you're in that process

2308
02:35:22,980 --> 02:35:32,860
but otherwise I mean it's it's it's a total conflict the female listeners of

2309
02:35:32,860 --> 02:35:41,380
our show, thank you for that analogy. No problem, a thank you. I saw Serenity again. Yay! Talk

2310
02:35:41,380 --> 02:35:45,220
about that. We have to go see Serenity next week. Let's go see Serenity next week. Let's

2311
02:35:45,220 --> 02:35:48,820
do it. After Firefly. Somebody needs to go see Serenity. Next Friday we're gonna see

2312
02:35:48,820 --> 02:35:53,340
Serenity again. Cause apparently- Blah, blah, blah, I got nine please. Okay, nevermind.

2313
02:35:53,340 --> 02:36:00,060
Although we kind of spoiled it for Dan. Yeah, we spoiled it for Jamie's husband. Well don't

2314
02:36:00,060 --> 02:36:03,900
spoil it for the listeners, please, but how did you spoil it without spoiling it for listeners?

2315
02:36:03,900 --> 02:36:09,020
We just mentioned, oh, that's so sad. Yeah, and oh, that's so funny, and oh, that's

2316
02:36:09,020 --> 02:36:13,060
so sad, how that was so funny, and oh, that's so, uh...

2317
02:36:13,060 --> 02:36:18,620
And the people who will know what I'm talking about, you have this utter scene of, oh, and

2318
02:36:18,620 --> 02:36:22,180
even a little bit of laughter, and all of a sudden, bam, dead silence.

2319
02:36:22,180 --> 02:36:29,900
I know. It was crazy time. Without being a spoiler.

2320
02:36:29,900 --> 02:36:33,440
I'm being corrected by one of our chatters who I'm going through trying to tally the

2321
02:36:33,440 --> 02:36:34,520
cage match votes.

2322
02:36:34,520 --> 02:36:38,000
The smile DK song is ding ding dong.

2323
02:36:38,000 --> 02:36:40,400
Not ding dang dong.

2324
02:36:40,400 --> 02:36:42,840
Okay people do you see how I got confused?

2325
02:36:42,840 --> 02:36:43,840
Come on.

2326
02:36:43,840 --> 02:36:44,840
With one vowel.

2327
02:36:44,840 --> 02:36:47,840
Here's your serenity spoiler by the way.

2328
02:36:47,840 --> 02:36:52,840
The reverb is not put on to do the hokey pokey and roller skates.

2329
02:36:52,840 --> 02:36:55,520
And then I pee in bowls.

2330
02:36:55,520 --> 02:36:56,520
You guys are weird.

2331
02:36:56,520 --> 02:36:58,860
Do you still have your icons on your computer?

2332
02:36:58,860 --> 02:37:02,280
deleted all those folders about it that you placed on my computer last week with

2333
02:37:02,280 --> 02:37:06,240
that it makes me want to put some more on there I don't think on so we're

2334
02:37:06,240 --> 02:37:10,320
gonna say about serenity and it being a ninth place huh yes serenity was the

2335
02:37:10,320 --> 02:37:15,540
ninth place is it made so far about 17 point something million serenity needs

2336
02:37:15,540 --> 02:37:27,440
to make $80,000 should we get 80 million hey we already got a sequel the chat

2337
02:37:27,440 --> 02:37:29,440
That room is saying 19 million, actually.

2338
02:37:29,440 --> 02:37:31,440
But remember, it's all estimates so far, so...

2339
02:37:31,440 --> 02:37:34,440
Yeah, go to that mojo entertainment...

2340
02:37:34,440 --> 02:37:35,440
Box office mojo is...

2341
02:37:35,440 --> 02:37:36,440
Yeah, whatever that was.

2342
02:37:36,440 --> 02:37:40,440
Everyone needs to see serenity a bajillion times, so declares me.

2343
02:37:42,440 --> 02:37:49,440
To imagine how many times a bajillion is, imagine one time a bajillion times.

2344
02:37:50,440 --> 02:37:52,440
That was really poor.

2345
02:37:52,440 --> 02:37:53,440
Yeah.

2346
02:37:53,440 --> 02:38:01,440
We haven't. I'm still running through all these freaking CAGEMATCH votes. I have never seen so many votes in the CAGEMATCH. Our chat room is passionate about this shit tonight.

2347
02:38:01,440 --> 02:38:03,440
Alright.

2348
02:38:03,440 --> 02:38:05,440
Alright, you guys ready to find out who won tonight's CAGEMATCH?

2349
02:38:05,440 --> 02:38:07,440
We always thought about password protecting your computer.

2350
02:38:07,440 --> 02:38:09,440
Girls, that's one!

2351
02:38:09,440 --> 02:38:10,440
Why, what?

2352
02:38:10,440 --> 02:38:11,440
So, cr-

2353
02:38:11,440 --> 02:38:14,440
Aw, Jesus, did you just go in and make folders on your desktop?

2354
02:38:14,440 --> 02:38:16,440
No. I could, shit.

2355
02:38:16,440 --> 02:38:17,440
No?

2356
02:38:17,440 --> 02:38:19,440
Hey, even I voted in the CAGEMATCH today, didn't I Rob?

2357
02:38:19,440 --> 02:38:20,440
Stop it. What?

2358
02:38:20,440 --> 02:38:22,440
Even I voted in the CAGEMATCH today.

2359
02:38:22,440 --> 02:38:25,440
Because I'm the first guy's voice thinking for matching service.

2360
02:38:52,440 --> 02:38:54,440
Thank you. Thank you, chat room. And thank you, actually-

2361
02:38:54,440 --> 02:38:56,440
Thank you for giving Rob the pity, though.

2362
02:38:56,440 --> 02:39:00,440
Yeah. And actually, Miek LaTov won it, and I didn't even win it, so...

2363
02:39:00,440 --> 02:39:02,440
Fuck you, Miek LaTov.

2364
02:39:02,440 --> 02:39:03,440
See, that's worth showing me up.

2365
02:39:03,440 --> 02:39:07,440
Wilbur, what have I been telling you? Pick stuff other than generic trance, and you'll have a winner.

2366
02:39:07,440 --> 02:39:09,440
I have been picking stuff other than generic trance.

2367
02:39:09,440 --> 02:39:11,440
Pick Britney Spears' Toxic.

2368
02:39:11,440 --> 02:39:12,440
Oh, God, no.

2369
02:39:12,440 --> 02:39:13,440
I'm just kidding.

2370
02:39:13,440 --> 02:39:17,440
I actually, it's funny, I actually did have a generic trance song, but it was really good.

2371
02:39:17,440 --> 02:39:20,440
Well, that means that next week I have to play ABBA.

2372
02:39:20,440 --> 02:39:24,440
I was actually disappointed that you did not choose ABBA tonight.

2373
02:39:24,440 --> 02:39:29,440
I was trying to actually be serious, but I almost put in a Danger Doom track.

2374
02:39:29,440 --> 02:39:34,440
Did you know that the new Madonna song actually samples ABBA?

2375
02:39:34,440 --> 02:39:35,440
Really.

2376
02:39:35,440 --> 02:39:39,440
And I honestly thought I had never heard the gayest song ever made,

2377
02:39:39,440 --> 02:39:41,440
but I think this could possibly be it.

2378
02:39:41,440 --> 02:39:47,440
Fusing Madonna and ABBA together could quite possibly be anal sex in song form.

2379
02:39:47,440 --> 02:39:54,440
I've already heard foreplay in song form. Anyone who's ever seen Phantom of the Opera has.

2380
02:39:54,440 --> 02:40:00,440
There should be an AB workout machine called ABBA. The ABBA. Whenever you crunch it, it gives you like...

2381
02:40:00,440 --> 02:40:04,440
It's like, mama mia.

2382
02:40:04,440 --> 02:40:06,440
Thanks for stopping, stupid.

2383
02:40:06,440 --> 02:40:09,440
Alright.

2384
02:40:09,440 --> 02:40:11,440
Oh my god, it's Rob.

2385
02:40:11,440 --> 02:40:15,440
I've heard music in foreplay form before too, and it's going to start off this next break.

2386
02:40:15,440 --> 02:40:20,440
break, and we'll be back with more Orange Lounge Radio, and the FUs of the week, we've

2387
02:40:20,440 --> 02:40:23,520
got to get to those, we're running out of time. So we'll be right back after this break

2388
02:40:23,520 --> 02:40:30,520
with more Orange Launch Radio.

2389
02:42:23,520 --> 02:42:25,520
Oh

2390
02:44:53,520 --> 02:45:13,520
I came in from a rainy surface on May Avenue

2391
02:45:13,520 --> 02:45:20,520
Thought I heard you talking so fast

2392
02:45:20,520 --> 02:45:27,520
I turn on the lights, I see the end of the radio

2393
02:45:27,520 --> 02:45:34,520
Still I can't escape the ghost of you

2394
02:45:34,520 --> 02:45:41,520
What has happened to it all, crazy some say

2395
02:45:41,520 --> 02:45:47,520
Where is the light that I recognize?

2396
02:45:47,520 --> 02:45:52,520
It's gone away, but I won't cry for yesterday

2397
02:45:52,520 --> 02:46:02,520
There's an ordinary world, somehow I have to find

2398
02:46:02,520 --> 02:46:10,520
And as I try to make my way to the ordinary world

2399
02:46:10,520 --> 02:46:16,520
I will learn to survive

2400
02:46:24,520 --> 02:46:29,520
For the best part of Orange Lounge, this GTR sucks!

2401
02:46:29,520 --> 02:46:30,520
Holla!

2402
02:46:30,520 --> 02:46:31,520
Stop! Stop! Stop!

2403
02:46:31,520 --> 02:46:33,520
We want our women!

2404
02:46:33,520 --> 02:46:34,520
That's right, PS!

2405
02:46:34,520 --> 02:46:36,520
GG PO!

2406
02:46:38,520 --> 02:46:39,520
We're back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

2407
02:46:39,520 --> 02:46:44,520
We need more celebrity promos like that, actually. We need more promos in general.

2408
02:46:44,520 --> 02:46:49,520
We just need to go out with a tape recorder and get more promos from people.

2409
02:46:49,520 --> 02:46:54,520
Remember, the promos run all day long, though, on the stations. You'd have to keep it G-rated, because people do listen to us at work.

2410
02:46:54,520 --> 02:46:59,520
I could utilize the word balls in a sentence without...

2411
02:46:59,520 --> 02:47:04,520
I could say balls in a sentence without making it.

2412
02:47:04,520 --> 02:47:11,760
In that break, you heard 4Play from 7th Style, so deep by Silvertear, because since Dark

2413
02:47:11,760 --> 02:47:16,000
Soccer was talking about generic trance, I thought I'd give you some generic trance there.

2414
02:47:16,000 --> 02:47:17,480
That's for generic.

2415
02:47:17,480 --> 02:47:20,280
But the fans love it, go figure.

2416
02:47:20,280 --> 02:47:25,200
Hoppin' Choppin' from DDR Mario, of course they're kind of interworking in that song

2417
02:47:25,200 --> 02:47:31,960
from Mario Brothers 2, one of my favorite video games of all time and I can't remember

2418
02:47:31,960 --> 02:47:33,120
the damn name of it.

2419
02:47:33,120 --> 02:47:39,000
And then Aurora featuring Amy Coleman, Ordinary World, of course, another trance remix of

2420
02:47:39,000 --> 02:47:44,160
an old song. Another thing you love, Dark Sakura, yes? When people take 70s and 80s

2421
02:47:44,160 --> 02:47:45,160
songs...

2422
02:47:45,160 --> 02:47:46,560
I particularly hate that version.

2423
02:47:46,560 --> 02:47:52,040
I'll tell you... No, I heard one today that was really bad. It was a cover of Close to

2424
02:47:52,040 --> 02:47:59,280
You by The Carpenters, but all it was, was like this... And then you'd hear this woman...

2425
02:47:59,280 --> 02:48:04,280
like me, they want to be close to you.

2426
02:48:04,280 --> 02:48:09,280
I have a version of that by Utada Hikaru.

2427
02:48:09,280 --> 02:48:14,280
Well, I'm sure that's fine, but close to you has been done like a million times,

2428
02:48:14,280 --> 02:48:19,280
and this one was especially offensive.

2429
02:48:19,280 --> 02:48:23,280
We need to get to the FUs of the week, because I'll be damned if we're not running out of showtime.

2430
02:48:23,280 --> 02:48:27,280
So chat room, when you guys send in your FUs tonight, you need to keep it short, because if you don't keep it short,

2431
02:48:27,280 --> 02:48:29,240
You're getting cut off.

2432
02:48:29,240 --> 02:48:31,640
I'm cutting you off tonight.

2433
02:48:31,640 --> 02:48:33,720
So we're going to get into the FUs, and the same goes for...

2434
02:48:33,720 --> 02:48:37,280
So just say, fuck you, to Rob, and that's it.

2435
02:48:37,280 --> 02:48:41,560
Extifer, I will take that microphone away from you.

2436
02:48:41,560 --> 02:48:44,040
Bugged, will you please babysit Extifer?

2437
02:48:44,040 --> 02:48:46,200
That's going to be your new official show title, Bugged.

2438
02:48:46,200 --> 02:48:48,040
You're Extifer's babysitter.

2439
02:48:48,040 --> 02:48:49,280
Get it out of your red ass!

2440
02:48:53,280 --> 02:48:54,200
Oh, lordy.

2441
02:48:54,200 --> 02:48:59,920
Alright, um, in order for us to have the FUs of the Week, I'd better get, uh, Dark Soccer's song ready.

2442
02:48:59,920 --> 02:49:02,800
Alright, Dark Soccer, why is it that we do the FUs of the Week every single week?

2443
02:49:03,300 --> 02:49:04,500
Grr. Argh.

2444
02:49:05,060 --> 02:49:07,880
That's such a nerd.

2445
02:49:08,120 --> 02:49:12,680
Um, FU goes toward all of the traffic on my way up here.

2446
02:49:13,180 --> 02:49:15,520
Um, FU goes toward Internet stalkers.

2447
02:49:16,420 --> 02:49:22,320
Um, FU goes towards, um, my rash and amoxicillin.

2448
02:49:22,320 --> 02:49:38,320
And the fact that my ass itches, and F you to add the blackboard for being down all day because A.R.C.'s website was dumb, I couldn't do my homework, so fuck all that, I'm done.

2449
02:49:38,320 --> 02:49:40,320
Moving on to Loki!

2450
02:49:40,320 --> 02:49:48,320
Um, well anyways, what? What the hell is your problem?

2451
02:49:48,320 --> 02:49:50,500
you sick monomenon

2452
02:49:50,500 --> 02:49:51,320
what?

2453
02:49:51,320 --> 02:49:53,800
it's my song anyway

2454
02:49:53,800 --> 02:49:58,660
fucking mcdonald's for making sub-par food and until they've recently fixed their cups

2455
02:49:58,660 --> 02:50:01,700
for making cups that explode my cup holders

2456
02:50:01,700 --> 02:50:05,400
that fucking sucks and also fucking to my neighbors who keep throwing their couches

2457
02:50:05,400 --> 02:50:07,300
in the goddamn dumpster

2458
02:50:07,300 --> 02:50:11,200
that is not what the dumpster is for, it's for trash not your fucking furniture

2459
02:50:11,200 --> 02:50:14,980
you know pay for uh... it to be hauled away like everyone else

2460
02:50:14,980 --> 02:50:17,800
and also uh...

2461
02:50:17,800 --> 02:50:27,800
I'm so lucky to win this stupid free online film. Yeah, whatever. I hate that fucking Monopoly game. I'm done.

2462
02:50:27,800 --> 02:50:44,160
I'd like to give an F.U. this week to ParanoiaSurvivorMax for showing up, way more than it's welcome

2463
02:50:44,160 --> 02:50:50,640
on the totally random DDR Extreme match-up, but it's a good thing my life doesn't revolve

2464
02:50:50,640 --> 02:50:51,640
around DDR.

2465
02:50:51,640 --> 02:50:54,160
I might be upset about that.

2466
02:50:54,160 --> 02:50:57,160
I'd also like to give an F.U. to

2467
02:50:57,160 --> 02:51:00,480
the fact that I feel really, really unprepared for something that's about to take place a

2468
02:51:00,480 --> 02:51:04,960
week from tomorrow and I'm not excited about it, but that's alright, life sucks for a birthday.

2469
02:51:04,960 --> 02:51:06,200
No, it's not your birthday.

2470
02:51:06,200 --> 02:51:06,840
Yes it is.

2471
02:51:06,840 --> 02:51:10,640
Well, I mean, yes it is your birthday, but that's not why I'm mad. Shut up!

2472
02:51:10,640 --> 02:51:13,000
This is my segment.

2473
02:51:13,000 --> 02:51:15,080
And then, um...

2474
02:51:15,080 --> 02:51:16,760
An F.U. to rainbows.

2475
02:51:16,760 --> 02:51:19,240
Like the one on X to her shirt.

2476
02:51:19,240 --> 02:51:23,640
Just kidding, I don't know. I'm actually not that angsty.

Extra verb.

Uh, fuck you, bugs.

2484
02:51:54,080 --> 02:52:06,080
Oh, no, no, no, no. I don't have really any FUs other than, uh, let's see, FU to things that suck.

2485
02:52:06,080 --> 02:52:11,080
I don't know. No, not F you to things that suck, because things that suck are sometimes really good.

He samples everybody.

2545
02:56:46,440 --> 02:56:47,440

Shut up, asshole.

02:57:03,040 --> 02:57:05,520
I'm not frigid.

2552
02:57:05,520 --> 02:57:06,520

I'm kidding.

2558
02:57:11,520 --> 02:57:12,520
All right.

2559
02:57:12,520 --> 02:57:17,520
God, we're running out of time on the show. They want to do Ask Orange Lounge, but we don't really have the time, so I think we're going to have to take it.

2560
02:57:17,520 --> 02:57:18,520
Let's do it.

2561
02:57:18,520 --> 02:57:19,520
Want to do it real quick?

2562
02:57:19,520 --> 02:57:20,520
Just do it.

2563
02:57:20,520 --> 02:57:21,520
Yes.

2564
02:57:21,520 --> 02:57:23,520
All right. You know, because we still got the podcast to do, and you want to go out.

2565
02:57:23,520 --> 02:57:24,520
I know.

2566
02:57:24,520 --> 02:57:25,520
All right.

2567
02:57:25,520 --> 02:57:29,520
But where would we be without our fans probably in bed?

2568
02:57:29,520 --> 02:57:31,520
All right.

2569
02:57:31,520 --> 02:57:32,520
Doing what in bed?

2570
02:57:32,520 --> 02:57:33,520
No.

2571
02:57:33,520 --> 02:57:34,520
Big cut.

2572
02:57:34,520 --> 02:57:37,520
Slumber party.

2573
02:57:37,520 --> 02:57:40,520
All right, guys. Fine. We'll do really quick Ask Orange Lounge.

2574
02:57:40,520 --> 02:57:43,860
parties with a bunch of people and the first girl who fell asleep we would take

2575
02:57:43,860 --> 02:57:48,300
her bra and stuff like dip it in orange juice and put it in the freezer. My

2576
02:57:48,300 --> 02:57:52,100
sister and her friend did that to one of their friends one time. It was really

2577
02:57:52,100 --> 02:57:55,460
funny. And then when the last person to stay awake would go and put toothpaste

2578
02:57:55,460 --> 02:57:58,980
on the toilet seat so that the first person who woke up in half asleep mode

2579
02:57:58,980 --> 02:58:14,080
to go use the bathroom would stick to the toilet wow let's ask orange lounge

2580
02:58:14,080 --> 02:58:19,800
some stupid question what will we find out this week on orange lounge radio I

2581
02:58:19,800 --> 02:58:24,720
think it's very interesting we didn't even need a question to find out that

2582
02:58:24,720 --> 02:58:31,720
Jamie played with other girls bras.

2583
02:58:34,200 --> 02:58:39,200
Fireboma said, where do babies come from? No seriously, I don't know.

2584
02:58:39,200 --> 02:58:42,720
I will let Extrofer answer this question on behalf of Orange Lounge Radio.

2585
02:58:42,720 --> 02:58:49,720
Extrofer, where do babies come from? Babies come from a females coup.

2586
02:58:49,720 --> 02:58:54,720
Legend of Zaku said, you guys seriously need a Wikipedia entry.

2587
02:58:54,720 --> 02:58:56,720
We do. How do we do that?

2588
02:58:56,720 --> 02:58:58,720
Someone has to make us one.

2589
02:58:58,720 --> 02:59:01,720
Somebody make us one. Is Bug going to do it?

2590
02:59:01,720 --> 02:59:05,720
Bug's working on it right now. Do people have to vote on it to make it stick?

2591
02:59:05,720 --> 02:59:08,720
Oh good. Okay, Bug's going to write that right now. Thank you, Zaku.

2592
02:59:08,720 --> 02:59:09,720
The Ferret needs an entry too.

2593
02:59:09,720 --> 02:59:10,720
We'll post that though.

2594
02:59:10,720 --> 02:59:13,720
Oh, other things I want to point out.

2595
02:59:13,720 --> 02:59:25,720
I'd like to point out, um, vote us a five on your player window in line 365 speaking of like voting stuff, and for the love of God, vote for us on podcast alley, because we're really falling behind over there.

2596
02:59:25,720 --> 02:59:38,720
So for your convenience, I'm going to post a link to where you can vote for our show, and you should do that right now, because that's a really good way for our podg- podcast to get exposure.

2597
02:59:38,720 --> 02:59:40,720
I hate that podcast.

2598
02:59:40,720 --> 02:59:42,720
It's a gas.

2599
02:59:42,720 --> 02:59:44,720
Alright.

2600
02:59:44,720 --> 02:59:46,720
Um, oh did somebody already do it?

2601
02:59:46,720 --> 02:59:50,720
Somebody posted a Wikipedia link.

2602
02:59:50,720 --> 02:59:52,720
Did somebody already do it?

2603
02:59:52,720 --> 02:59:55,720
Somebody probably just made an entry that says it sucks.

2604
02:59:55,720 --> 02:59:57,720
It stinks.

2605
02:59:57,720 --> 03:00:00,720
Oh no it's not. Okay.

2606
03:00:00,720 --> 03:00:02,720
Yeah you need to start. Somebody needs to hurry up and write it.

2607
03:00:02,720 --> 03:00:04,720
Alright.

2608
03:00:04,720 --> 03:00:09,960
sakorina says why is american thanksgiving later than canadian

2609
03:00:09,960 --> 03:00:12,120
thanksgiving which is now

2610
03:00:12,120 --> 03:00:13,160
wait a second

2611
03:00:13,160 --> 03:00:14,400
oh yes loki

2612
03:00:14,400 --> 03:00:17,200
why do the canadians get thanksgiving anyways?

2613
03:00:17,200 --> 03:00:19,520
how many indians did they kill? come on

2614
03:00:19,520 --> 03:00:20,800
exactly

2615
03:00:20,800 --> 03:00:24,680
they didn't rape the land of indians

2616
03:00:24,680 --> 03:00:26,440
no just kidding

2617
03:00:26,440 --> 03:00:27,280
uh...

2618
03:00:27,280 --> 03:00:30,960
god we're horribly offensive sometimes i really hope we didn't offend anybody with that comment

2619
03:00:30,960 --> 03:00:35,040
but um... if anything we should be giving thanks for maple syrup because that's what they're

2620
03:00:35,040 --> 03:00:36,040
known for

2621
03:00:36,040 --> 03:00:41,920
that and brian adams. I really don't know why thanksgiving is later

2622
03:00:41,920 --> 03:00:44,040
it's all timed

2623
03:00:44,040 --> 03:00:47,760
for the shopping industry

2624
03:00:47,760 --> 03:00:51,760
i know i know

2625
03:00:56,760 --> 03:00:59,800
wasn't michael j fox from canada

2626
03:00:59,800 --> 03:01:01,800
What about David Duchovny?

2627
03:01:01,800 --> 03:01:03,800
Somebody in the chatroom is saying if DDR...

2628
03:01:03,800 --> 03:01:06,800
Do you remember that song, David Duchovny, Why Won't You Love Me?

2629
03:01:06,800 --> 03:01:07,800
No.

2630
03:01:07,800 --> 03:01:09,800
Someone wrote a song about him.

2631
03:01:09,800 --> 03:01:14,800
If somebody in the chatroom is saying that DDR Freak is not allowed to have a Wikipedia entry, so why should we?

2632
03:01:14,800 --> 03:01:17,800
Who said DDR Freak is not allowed to have a Wikipedia entry? That's not cool.

2633
03:01:17,800 --> 03:01:18,800
Maybe I can have one.

2634
03:01:18,800 --> 03:01:20,800
Yeah, make them one. I don't care.

2635
03:01:20,800 --> 03:01:22,800
I think they had one and it got removed or something.

2636
03:01:22,800 --> 03:01:24,800
Somebody probably complained about it.

2637
03:01:24,800 --> 03:01:25,800
Let me have a look.

2638
03:01:25,800 --> 03:01:30,800
If we get a Wikipedia entry posted, just fucking don't complain about it, and we'll be fine.

2639
03:01:30,800 --> 03:01:35,800
So don't tattle. If you tattle, I will come find you and beat you up, and it will not be a good thing.

2640
03:01:35,800 --> 03:01:40,800
Because you're probably the end of feeding Rafa.

2641
03:01:40,800 --> 03:01:43,800
Jayda's arms are flailing.

2642
03:01:43,800 --> 03:01:46,800
We're already running late. No more questions, people. These are the last ones.

2643
03:01:46,800 --> 03:01:53,800
Jayda2005 says, why is it cheaper to rent movies and expensive to rent video games?

2644
03:01:53,800 --> 03:01:58,600
Because video games are more expensive than movies video games such a back like 50 bucks games only such or movies now

2645
03:01:58,600 --> 03:02:03,240
I said you back like 25 exactly and they have to you know rent more times in order to make their money back

2646
03:02:05,280 --> 03:02:10,800
And stop stealing games people stop stealing them for the rental stores, that's what the Internet's for

2647
03:02:12,040 --> 03:02:18,520
If I mispronounce this, I'm really sorry. I don't know if it's just II or just with like the silent II

2648
03:02:18,520 --> 03:02:22,880
I'm not sure if the East Islander night huh was it I think just I'm gonna go with just okay

2649
03:02:23,400 --> 03:02:28,600
But it could be just a it could be like just a like Jack a this person's gonna kick my ass

2650
03:02:28,600 --> 03:02:33,920
I'm gonna go with just all right. Why did you decide to start making an online radio show um?

2651
03:02:34,960 --> 03:02:37,180
Me personally your turn, okay?

2652
03:02:37,180 --> 03:02:42,120
I've been doing online radio personally since I was in college which was a long time ago

2653
03:02:42,120 --> 03:02:48,260
I'm actually not that old, but I was doing a college radio show, and then I got invited

2654
03:02:48,260 --> 03:02:53,140
to be on another internet radio program called Understation Live, that was years ago, and

2655
03:02:53,140 --> 03:02:56,180
that just kind of turned into this, where it was like, you know what, we have fun doing

2656
03:02:56,180 --> 03:03:00,500
Understation Live, let's do a show about video games, and sure enough, here we are, Dark

2657
03:03:00,500 --> 03:03:02,820
Sakura was a frequent guest on that show.

2658
03:03:02,820 --> 03:03:09,780
Loki just kind of showed up, but it worked out, so Loki's still here.

2659
03:03:09,780 --> 03:03:16,780
juice day. It is juice day. Not just stay, but juice day. Just for the record.

2660
03:03:17,780 --> 03:03:24,780
Alright. SSJ100Matt, what? Oh, I was just going to say, like, juice stay in your chair.

2661
03:03:25,780 --> 03:03:30,780
Shut up. I haven't got any rules on Wikipedia yet.

2662
03:03:31,780 --> 03:03:37,780
SSJ100Matt wants to know, I may be the only person on Earth to break an afterburner pad.

2663
03:03:37,780 --> 03:03:39,780
Am I the only one to break one?

2664
03:03:39,780 --> 03:03:41,780
Umm...

2665
03:03:41,780 --> 03:03:42,780
No.

2666
03:03:42,780 --> 03:03:43,780
No.

2667
03:03:43,780 --> 03:03:44,780
Loki says no.

2668
03:03:44,780 --> 03:03:45,780
How do you know this for a fact, Loki?

2669
03:03:45,780 --> 03:03:49,780
Cause that's ridiculous to say that you're the only person that's broken one.

2670
03:03:49,780 --> 03:03:51,780
They're not indestructible.

2671
03:03:51,780 --> 03:03:55,780
I'm sure at some point, like, somebody who weighed like 700 pounds tried to play on one

2672
03:03:55,780 --> 03:03:57,780
and probably broke it.

2673
03:03:57,780 --> 03:03:59,780
So, I think that's safe to say, wouldn't you?

2674
03:03:59,780 --> 03:04:00,780
Sure.

2675
03:04:00,780 --> 03:04:04,780
You're probably not the first, but you might be one of a very select few.

2676
03:04:04,780 --> 03:04:06,780
And that's something to be proud about.

2677
03:04:06,780 --> 03:04:21,100
Why did Midway delay the GameCube version of Midway Arcade Treasures 3, and why did

2678
03:04:21,100 --> 03:04:24,100
my laptop just lag for like 12 minutes straight?

2679
03:04:24,100 --> 03:04:29,720
GameCube games seem to be getting finished last, like for example Rainbow Six Lockdown

2680
03:04:29,720 --> 03:04:32,040
didn't come out until two weeks later.

2681
03:04:32,040 --> 03:04:35,340
Same with Midway Arcade Treasures, it doesn't come out until two weeks later.

2682
03:04:35,340 --> 03:04:38,220
Some of the Mortal Kombat games came out way later for GameCube, too, right?

2683
03:04:38,220 --> 03:04:39,220
The reception.

2684
03:04:39,220 --> 03:04:40,220
Some like that.

2685
03:04:40,220 --> 03:04:44,380
Yeah, it's just, I don't know, either they have to go through some, like, process of,

2686
03:04:44,380 --> 03:04:47,860
you know, Nintendo has to review it or something, or, I don't know.

2687
03:04:47,860 --> 03:04:51,460
For whatever reason, it's delayed.

2688
03:04:51,460 --> 03:04:52,460
Very interesting.

2689
03:04:52,460 --> 03:04:53,460
All right.

2690
03:04:53,460 --> 03:04:55,780
We've got to call it a show, boys and girls.

2691
03:04:55,780 --> 03:04:56,780
We're done here.

2692
03:04:56,780 --> 03:05:00,020
And, sorry, Nintendo Mania, I can't help you with your laptop.

2693
03:05:00,020 --> 03:05:01,700
Call your local computer experts.

2694
03:05:01,700 --> 03:05:02,700
All right.

2695
03:05:02,700 --> 03:05:06,700
Final thoughts, you guys? It's the end of the show. Bud, your final thought?

2696
03:05:06,700 --> 03:05:09,700
I like my PSP.

2697
03:05:09,700 --> 03:05:11,700
Extifer, your final thought?

2698
03:05:11,700 --> 03:05:18,700
Uh, stop it. I like, um, I don't like his PSP.

2699
03:05:18,700 --> 03:05:21,700
Loki, your final thought?

2700
03:05:21,700 --> 03:05:26,700
I have too many GameStop receipts.

2701
03:05:26,700 --> 03:05:28,700
My final thought is, meow.

2702
03:05:28,700 --> 03:05:29,700
Dark Sakura?

2703
03:05:29,700 --> 03:05:32,700
Reject Plus Icons, Bleacher Katamari

2704
03:05:33,700 --> 03:05:35,700
Final Word of the Show, one word to sum it all up

2705
03:05:35,700 --> 03:05:38,700
We're running late but thanks you guys very much for tuning in tonight and listening to us

2706
03:05:38,700 --> 03:05:40,700
We appreciate it, that's as far as the corn goes there

2707
03:05:40,700 --> 03:05:43,700
Alright, thank you guys very much for tuning in and listening to us tonight

2708
03:05:43,700 --> 03:05:44,700
We appreciate it

2709
03:05:44,700 --> 03:05:47,700
Whore us up, tell a friend that you love Orange Launch Radio

2710
03:05:47,700 --> 03:05:50,700
Tell a friend that you hate Orange Launch Radio because they might still check it out

2711
03:05:50,700 --> 03:05:52,700
And that's it, thank you guys, we'll see you next week

2712
03:05:52,700 --> 03:05:56,700
One word to sum it all up, Dark Sakura, what is tonight's final word?

2713
03:05:56,700 --> 03:05:58,700
Itchy, Tasty

2714
03:05:58,700 --> 03:06:00,700
That does it for another...

2715
03:06:00,700 --> 03:06:02,700
Hold on, that was two. That was two!

2716
03:06:02,700 --> 03:06:04,700
You pick one. You pick one or the other.

2717
03:06:04,700 --> 03:06:07,700
I had to quote the game, but it's itchy.

2718
03:06:07,700 --> 03:06:13,700
That does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live.

2719
03:06:13,700 --> 03:06:18,700
Orange Lounge Radio Live is an Orange Lounge Radio production.

And now, here is your fortune cookie message of the day.

2722
03:06:49,700 --> 03:06:53,700
I miss you more than Michael Bay missed the mark

2723
03:06:53,700 --> 03:06:57,700
when he made Pearl Harbor

2724
03:06:57,700 --> 03:07:01,700
I miss you more than that movie missed the point

2725
03:07:01,700 --> 03:07:05,700
and that's an awful lot girl

2726
03:07:05,700 --> 03:07:09,700
and now, now you've gone away

2727
03:07:09,700 --> 03:07:13,700
and all I'm trying to say

2728
03:07:13,700 --> 03:07:15,700
Is Pearl Harbor suck

2729
03:07:16,700 --> 03:07:18,700
And I miss you

2730
03:07:26,700 --> 03:07:30,700
I need you like Ben Affleck needs acting school

2731
03:07:31,700 --> 03:07:34,700
He was terrible in that film

2732
03:07:34,700 --> 03:07:36,700
I need you like Cuba good

2733
03:07:36,700 --> 03:07:38,700
He needed a bigger part

2734
03:07:38,700 --> 03:07:46,700
He's way better than Ben Affleck now All I can think about is your smile

2735
03:07:46,700 --> 03:07:52,700
And that shitty movie too For all the sun

2736
03:07:52,700 --> 03:07:57,700
And I miss you

2737
03:08:11,700 --> 03:08:18,700
Why does Michael Bay get to keep on making movies

2738
03:08:18,700 --> 03:08:21,700
I guess Pearl Harbor sucks

2739
03:08:21,700 --> 03:08:28,700
Just a little bit more than I miss you

2740
03:08:51,700 --> 03:08:57,740
