00:04.000 --> 00:14.000
You're tuned in to the Orange Lounge Radio 2 Go Edition, your podcast home for all the latest video game news and gamer chat.

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
Now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Skye, and Logan.

00:19.000 --> 00:29.000
Hello, everybody. Once again, welcome to the Orange Lounge Radio 2 Go Edition, your home for all that news that gamers really want to know about.

00:29.000 --> 00:32.760
Thanks so much for subscribing to us, we really do appreciate your support.

00:32.760 --> 00:37.760
We are an independent production, you know, it's just three buddies here doing a show

00:37.760 --> 00:41.120
out of a spare bedroom in one of our apartments, really.

00:41.120 --> 00:44.000
So we appreciate you guys supporting just, you know, the independent podcast.

00:44.000 --> 00:47.680
We do this because we love video games and we never shut up about them.

00:47.680 --> 00:50.600
Isn't that right, Dark Sakura, one of my lovely co-hosts over there?

00:50.600 --> 00:53.120
I don't shut up about anything ever.

00:53.120 --> 00:54.200
This is true.

00:54.200 --> 00:55.520
Video games is one of them though, right?

00:55.520 --> 01:01.840
Yeah, I'd have to say video games are probably up at the top of the list, that and Serenity.

01:01.840 --> 01:03.720
Loki is here as well, the tech master Loki.

01:03.720 --> 01:04.720
Yes, I am.

01:04.720 --> 01:05.720
How are you doing?

01:05.720 --> 01:06.720
I'm good.

01:06.720 --> 01:07.800
He never shuts up about video games either.

01:07.800 --> 01:12.920
Yeah, and in fact, even the people I work with who we sell video games and they still

01:12.920 --> 01:15.240
don't like listening to me.

01:15.240 --> 01:16.240
But you love bacon.

01:16.240 --> 01:19.520
Yes, I have my I Love Bacon shirt on.

01:19.520 --> 01:20.520
Awesome.

01:20.520 --> 01:21.520
Good choice.

01:21.520 --> 01:22.780
All right, let's get right into it.

01:22.780 --> 01:23.780
We don't mess around.

01:23.780 --> 01:27.620
into tonight's topics, we always start it off by letting you know what's going on in

01:27.620 --> 01:31.660
our gaming world. Start off with Dark Sakura.

01:31.660 --> 01:35.780
I did something really stupid. I did the wrong homework the week before last. So this week

01:35.780 --> 01:41.140
I had to make up for that homework and my geography homework and do a humongous project

01:41.140 --> 01:42.140
in Illustrator.

01:42.140 --> 01:43.140
So no time for games.

01:43.140 --> 01:45.140
I played with my puppies.

01:45.140 --> 01:46.140
Okay, well that's something.

01:46.140 --> 01:49.420
I did go into Bark Mode about three times this week though with other people.

01:49.420 --> 01:51.580
All right, were you able to get any cool unlocks that way?

01:51.580 --> 01:56.060
No, however, my friend has an extra Fireman's Hat and is going to lend it to me because

01:56.060 --> 02:00.860
if you ever have the Fireman's Hat in your inventory at any time, you will automatically

02:00.860 --> 02:03.060
have a Dalmatian even if you give the hat away.

02:03.060 --> 02:04.060
Interesting.

02:04.060 --> 02:05.060
Okay.

02:05.060 --> 02:06.260
So, I'm going to get a Dalmatian next week.

02:06.260 --> 02:09.420
I have to be honest, I haven't been that into Nintendogs.

02:09.420 --> 02:10.420
It's kind of my interest.

02:10.420 --> 02:11.420
Did your puppies run away?

02:11.420 --> 02:15.700
No, not yet, but they all have fleas because I haven't been bathing them.

02:15.700 --> 02:16.700
Ew.

02:16.700 --> 02:17.700
Oh well.

02:17.700 --> 02:19.580
Loki, what's your game that we've been like?

02:19.580 --> 02:25.280
I tried Lost in Blue Bit for the DS and that was kind of fun and then had to play the stupid

02:25.280 --> 02:28.200
dogs because otherwise they'll run away.

02:28.200 --> 02:30.740
You know, I'm actually taking two of my copies back.

02:30.740 --> 02:32.300
I don't want them.

02:32.300 --> 02:36.620
The game's not that interesting and after, you know, buying...

02:36.620 --> 02:41.140
Well, you did kind of make a mistake by buying all three versions and not realizing that

02:41.140 --> 02:42.140
all you've seen...

02:42.140 --> 02:43.140
I didn't know.

02:43.140 --> 02:44.140
I didn't realize it.

02:44.140 --> 02:45.920
You need to bring your other versions so that I can get your dogs.

02:45.920 --> 02:46.920
I guess.

02:46.920 --> 02:49.020
We'll have to do that before I return them, but...

02:49.020 --> 02:53.860
Anyways, so the other than that, I've been playing DDR Extreme 2, and that was fun.

02:53.860 --> 02:57.740
That's a good dance game, except my dance pads don't work it right now, so I have to

02:57.740 --> 02:59.740
play it on the controller.

02:59.740 --> 03:00.740
Boring.

03:00.740 --> 03:02.100
Ah, whatever.

03:02.100 --> 03:06.380
You know, when I was staring at my copy of Graffiti Kingdom this week, thinking, when

03:06.380 --> 03:13.300
am I going to play this, and I didn't play it this week, so maybe next week.

03:13.300 --> 03:17.580
But yeah, hopefully I'm going to be playing some more PSP games, especially tomorrow,

03:17.580 --> 03:22.140
or not tomorrow, on Tuesday, because I potentially have jury duty and I've got to wait all day

03:22.140 --> 03:25.280
to get called in. So, lots of time for the portable games.

03:25.280 --> 03:30.000
If it makes you feel any better, my copy of We Love Katamari is still unwrapped.

03:30.000 --> 03:35.460
But you did finally get it. Yes, I got it the night after the show.

03:35.460 --> 03:40.000
It's not such a touchy subject for you anymore. No, not as touchy. It's a very wrapped subject.

03:40.000 --> 03:43.400
I keep it under wraps. That was awful.

03:43.400 --> 03:44.400
That was awful.

03:44.400 --> 03:45.400
That was really bad.

03:45.400 --> 03:46.400
Boo!

03:46.400 --> 03:47.400
Alright.

03:47.400 --> 03:48.400
I did it on purpose.

03:48.400 --> 03:49.400
Anything else, Logie?

03:49.400 --> 03:51.080
No, that's really it.

03:51.080 --> 03:52.080
Alright.

03:52.080 --> 03:55.160
Things that I have been playing this week, I actually checked out Pack and Roll for the

03:55.160 --> 03:57.400
Nintendo DS.

03:57.400 --> 03:58.820
Kind of fun, it's pretty cool.

03:58.820 --> 04:00.720
It's one of those, like, kind of quickie games.

04:00.720 --> 04:04.440
Like, it's a game that I don't think I could really see myself, like, oh, I'm gonna sit

04:04.440 --> 04:07.920
down for three hours and just have a marathon Pack and Roll session.

04:07.920 --> 04:10.440
It's kind of one of those things where, like, yeah, I could, like, fire this up, play a

04:10.440 --> 04:14.780
level while I'm waiting for something else, then just save it and do it again later.

04:14.780 --> 04:19.580
So it's kind of a nice, simple, relaxing action game.

04:19.580 --> 04:24.500
I spent at least 30 minutes on it at E3, on the one level.

04:24.500 --> 04:28.220
I didn't find it to be quite so addicting, I mean it was kind of cool, it was a really

04:28.220 --> 04:29.220
cool concept.

04:29.220 --> 04:33.180
Yes, it kind of whores the stylus features of the DS out, but you know, it's in a good

04:33.180 --> 04:34.180
way.

04:34.180 --> 04:35.180
I guess that's what the stylus is for.

04:35.180 --> 04:39.260
I like the idea that you kind of use Pac-Man as like a trackball, although part of me kind

04:39.260 --> 04:42.520
of wonders what that game would be like if you actually had a trackball. The game would

04:42.520 --> 04:47.460
surprisingly be a hell of a lot like Crystal Castles, that old, old Atari game.

04:47.460 --> 04:49.660
It made me think of Marble Madness.

04:49.660 --> 04:52.540
Marble Madness kind of, I thought, because with the dots and everything, it really reminded

04:52.540 --> 04:58.340
me of Crystal Castles, but instead you were using the stylus to kind of draw your kind

04:58.340 --> 05:03.340
of roll with the pen, so it was kind of neat. And you do like all these different moves.

05:03.340 --> 05:06.660
It's still kind of only like a borderline recommendation for me though. I think if you're

05:06.660 --> 05:10.280
a fan of this type of genre, I think you'll get a kick out of this, but it's also a type

05:10.280 --> 05:15.660
of thing that I kind of, I couldn't see myself playing it for a heck of a long time. I couldn't

05:15.660 --> 05:19.100
see myself playing this game until I beat it. I think I'd kind of get sick of it. And

05:19.100 --> 05:24.100
the graphics weren't, the graphics, it looked like a Playstation game on my DS, which I

05:24.100 --> 05:27.780
guess is kind of cool, but I don't know, I don't think I really liked the graphical style

05:27.780 --> 05:32.140
of the game. It was kind of dumb. I didn't care for it, but Pac-Man looked really cute

05:32.140 --> 05:36.340
in the little bottom window where he's the controller.

05:36.340 --> 05:41.700
Better than Pac-Pix. Pac-Pix sucked. And I got rid of that game quick. And then I got

05:41.700 --> 05:45.300
this game. And I was just like, eh. Eh.

05:45.300 --> 05:46.620
Dude, Pac-Pix was awesome.

05:46.620 --> 05:51.660
So borderline recommendation for Pac and Roll for me. The other game, I didn't play this

05:51.660 --> 05:54.720
enough. I'm not going to make a final judgment on this game. I did play a little bit of Lost

05:54.720 --> 06:00.020
in Blue. It seemed a little... I don't know if it's just not my type of game. If I'm just

06:00.020 --> 06:04.200
not into those point-and-click games. Although, I don't know, for some reason I was thinking

06:04.200 --> 06:09.400
like King's Quest, but with the little added, like, you can actually use the stylus to dig

06:09.400 --> 06:15.040
in the sand and kind of explore. Seemed a little gimmicky to me, but I don't think

06:15.040 --> 06:17.660
I played enough of the game to really get a feel for this yet. I want to give the game

06:17.660 --> 06:20.020
another shot, so I'm not going to make a final judgment on it yet, but I did check

06:20.020 --> 06:23.580
it out. I don't know if I'm going to like this one, though. It just doesn't seem

06:23.580 --> 06:24.900
like my kind of game, but we'll see.

06:24.900 --> 06:28.820
I played it for a little bit. I played it through the first day that you're on the

06:28.820 --> 06:34.940
Island, and it's like you have to do things really in order, otherwise you're only player

06:34.940 --> 06:37.740
is going to die, because you start off with very little life, and it's just like...

06:37.740 --> 06:41.420
It seemed like it would be really easy to lose in the beginning, a little frustrating,

06:41.420 --> 06:43.300
but I don't know, I'm going to wait and play it more.

06:43.300 --> 06:47.620
It was pretty frustrating. I hear like trying to hunt the animals and stuff later on is

06:47.620 --> 06:52.260
even more frustrating, and just stuff that, the games are very frustrating.

06:52.260 --> 06:56.160
Oh, and the text boxes were horrible too, like you only see one line of text at a time,

06:56.160 --> 07:00.600
and you have to wait, even though I put my display speed on fast, I don't like that method

07:00.600 --> 07:04.800
of showing text. So, I don't know if I'm going to like this one, guys, but I'm not making

07:04.800 --> 07:08.460
a final judgment yet. There might be something that happens. There's a lot of games I first

07:08.460 --> 07:10.940
play and I don't like them, and then I warm up to them later. So, I'm going to check it

07:10.940 --> 07:14.380
out. A lot of games coming out next month I want for the DS, like Trauma Center. That's

07:14.380 --> 07:17.120
going to be fun. I want to check out Trauma Center as well. There's something I'm waiting

07:17.120 --> 07:22.160
on for the GBA. What's that? A whole lot. Gunstar Super Heroes. Oh, yeah, that game

07:22.160 --> 07:25.000
looks like it's going to be awesome. One other game I checked out this week was Dance Dance

07:25.000 --> 07:29.160
Revolution Extreme 2, of course, you know, Orange Launch Radio was started on the music

07:29.160 --> 07:33.100
video games and kind of grew beyond that, but you know, I still have a place in my heart

07:33.100 --> 07:34.480
for the music video games.

07:34.480 --> 07:39.560
Dance Dance Revolution Extreme 2, if you are a fan of the dancing games in any capacity,

07:39.560 --> 07:43.520
you must, I highly recommend Dance Dance Revolution Extreme 2.

07:43.520 --> 07:49.040
I talked about this a lot more on Sunday night's live 3 hour show, but I think it really kind

07:49.040 --> 07:55.500
of transitioned the series from being an arcade port, which every other version before this

07:55.500 --> 08:01.040
was, to a home console version of DDR, and that's through the dance master mode where

08:01.040 --> 08:05.480
you kind of learn, and it's very similar to BeatMania 2DX's drill mode, where you kind

08:05.480 --> 08:09.940
of do little missions and step on these arrows and do this part of the song and get a full

08:09.940 --> 08:15.220
combo here, but that's really how you unlock all your songs, and I think that's just kind

08:15.220 --> 08:20.240
of a neat concept, a neat way to do the game, so I think fans of the series are going to

08:20.240 --> 08:24.360
love it and there's just a great song list for fans of Babani. If you're not so much

08:24.360 --> 08:29.320
a dance game fan, if you're just the type that plays the games casually, I don't think

08:29.320 --> 08:33.620
Extreme 2 is a good entry level pick. I think it's not a good party game because the song

08:33.620 --> 08:37.840
list is so limited to just the licenses when you first start and you really have to work

08:37.840 --> 08:42.120
at it to get unlocks, unlike the other games which were all time unlocks. And supposedly

08:42.120 --> 08:45.700
this game has time unlocks in it as well, we don't know yet for sure, but I haven't

08:45.700 --> 08:50.920
played it enough to really know for sure. So, if you're more of a casual fan or if you're

08:50.920 --> 08:55.680
curious about DDR, I would recommend you start on Max 2, which was from two years ago, but

08:55.680 --> 09:00.200
it had a very solid song list and, you know, I think it was a lot more accessible for people

09:00.200 --> 09:04.580
who hadn't really played DDR before, so that's just my recommendation. Otherwise, graphics

09:04.580 --> 09:09.220
in the game are great, they gave every song a unique music video this time, it's great.

09:09.220 --> 09:13.380
The sound, of course, kick butt song list, couple of licenses I didn't like, but that's

09:13.380 --> 09:16.700
bound to happen when you have such a diverse song list.

09:16.700 --> 09:19.580
And the gameplay, it's DDR.

09:19.580 --> 09:20.580
What else can I say?

09:20.580 --> 09:26.260
So, highly recommend if you're a fan of music games, kinda borderline if you're not so much,

09:26.260 --> 09:29.220
if you just are interested in dance games and want to get into the series.

09:29.220 --> 09:33.020
I have to disagree with most of the music selection, though, because I wasn't too impressed.

09:33.020 --> 09:34.020
With what you heard.

09:34.020 --> 09:38.460
Yeah, it wasn't, it was like a bunch of repetitive, old, same old trance.

09:38.460 --> 09:42.100
I think when you see what they picked from the old games, though, to put next to it,

09:42.100 --> 09:46.340
though, I think it makes it a lot more solid. They really took a lot of the things the fans

09:46.340 --> 09:53.260
have been asking for for years. Sakura, Daikonkai, Cartoon Heroes, Sink, it's all in there. So

09:53.260 --> 09:57.420
that's kind of nice that Konami, you know, really, I think, really listen to their DDR

09:57.420 --> 10:02.020
fans on this one. Anyway, yes?

10:02.020 --> 10:08.020
I actually did have something that I had forgotten to mention earlier.

10:08.020 --> 10:10.020
Back to the Gunstar Heroes release.

10:10.020 --> 10:13.020
There's actually going to be a Sega Ages treasure chest.

10:13.020 --> 10:16.020
I found this on Treasure's homepage.

10:16.020 --> 10:21.020
It's featuring Gunstar Heroes' dynamite heady alien soldier.

10:21.020 --> 10:27.020
And of course in the Sega Ages 2500 collection it will be sold for 2500 yen.

10:27.020 --> 10:29.020
And I hope that comes out here.

10:29.020 --> 10:34.020
Also, Treasure is doing the Bleach game, but that's off of the anime.

10:34.020 --> 10:35.020
Hmm.

10:35.020 --> 10:36.020
Okay.

10:36.020 --> 10:37.020
Cool.

10:37.020 --> 10:38.020
If it's Treasure, it's gotta be good.

10:38.020 --> 10:40.460
You know, I actually liked the SEGA collection they put out.

10:40.460 --> 10:44.180
A lot of people really panned it and said it was awful, and I guess that's probably

10:44.180 --> 10:47.040
because of the Golden Axe remake, but you know, I thought it was a good deal.

10:47.040 --> 10:49.420
I thought it was better than that Namco collection that just came out.

10:49.420 --> 10:51.420
I thought the SEGA one was way better, but...

10:51.420 --> 10:55.100
I didn't buy it because we've already so far have some of the SEGA Aegis games we went

10:55.100 --> 10:56.820
to since we imported them.

10:56.820 --> 10:59.460
Have any of you guys picked up the Midway Arcade Treasures 3 yet?

10:59.460 --> 11:02.980
Not three, I'm definitely interested because it has, I didn't even realize this game was

11:02.980 --> 11:05.000
in it, but it has Iron Man's Off-Road in it.

11:05.000 --> 11:09.340
That was like my favorite racing game, which is kind of not even really, like, it's borderline

11:09.340 --> 11:10.340
racing.

11:10.340 --> 11:11.340
But yeah, I want to check that out.

11:11.340 --> 11:12.620
I've heard good things about it.

11:12.620 --> 11:14.620
I'll tell you what broke my heart.

11:14.620 --> 11:19.580
Our landlord, who's actually good friends of ours, cleaned out some stuff out of their

11:19.580 --> 11:26.620
attic in the garage and brought down an Atari 2600 wood grain that had cobwebs all over

11:26.620 --> 11:33.020
right now. It made my heart break to have a box full of games. I was like, noooo! Except

11:33.020 --> 11:37.980
it was like that slow motion, noooo!

11:37.980 --> 11:40.520
Loki got me thinking about racing games. You know, did you hear about what's coming to

11:40.520 --> 11:44.360
America that was in Japan, but it's finally, it's going to make its way in limited release

11:44.360 --> 11:46.500
in America. At least I read this on some gaming site this week.

11:46.500 --> 11:47.800
Mario Kart GP.

11:47.800 --> 11:48.800
Mario Kart GP.

11:48.800 --> 11:49.800
Sweet.

11:49.800 --> 11:51.400
I know. I can't wait to check that out.

11:51.400 --> 11:52.400
Alright.

11:52.400 --> 11:53.840
You know what I actually think Nintendo should do?

11:53.840 --> 11:54.840
Hmm?

11:54.840 --> 12:00.840
I know that some of the games were remade later on for the DS, not the DS, but the GameCube.

12:00.840 --> 12:03.840
They should do like a 64 double D collection.

12:03.840 --> 12:05.840
Possibly.

12:05.840 --> 12:08.840
Because they got the 64 double D in Japan and we never got it.

12:08.840 --> 12:14.840
But I heard that the version of F-Zero was supposed to be really excellent.

12:14.840 --> 12:16.840
I mean, of course, we got an upgrade.

12:16.840 --> 12:18.840
Maybe there's something you can download on the Revolution. Who knows?

12:18.840 --> 12:19.840
Possible.

12:19.840 --> 12:22.840
We'll see. Anyway, we need to do some follow-up from last week.

12:22.840 --> 12:27.260
We had two contests last week, we're going to give away some stuff and the first thing

12:27.260 --> 12:32.760
is we're going to give away a copy of the DDR Extreme 2 V-Rare as well as a copy of

12:32.760 --> 12:33.920
the Max 2 V-Rare.

12:33.920 --> 12:37.440
We gave one away on the live show last week and we told you guys on the podcast you had

12:37.440 --> 12:39.520
a chance to enter this week.

12:39.520 --> 12:43.920
Many of you did, so DarkSakura pull a number out of the hat and let's see who's going to

12:43.920 --> 12:45.440
win the copy of the V-Rares.

12:45.440 --> 12:49.400
Remember guys, these aren't games, they're the V-Rares, the soundtracks.

12:49.400 --> 12:52.900
some folks in their email subjects that I want to win the games. Sorry, guys, it's just

12:52.900 --> 12:54.900
the soundtracks. We don't have that big a budget yet.

12:54.900 --> 13:00.180
All right, who are we giving it to? What's the number? Number 28. Number 28, okay, let's

13:00.180 --> 13:09.900
see, it's 15. This will be number 30. This is 28 right here. Our winner is Joseph E.

13:09.900 --> 13:16.380
Joseph E. is the winner of the other soundtracks we're going to give away there. His email

13:16.380 --> 13:20.160
address says Red Star in it, so I'm guessing that's his handle there. So congratulations

13:20.160 --> 13:25.940
to you. You've won the other soundtracks. Good job.

13:25.940 --> 13:28.500
Also what we're going to give away, we're going to give away, now this is a game that

13:28.500 --> 13:32.160
we're giving away. We're giving away a copy of In the Groove and this is another dance

13:32.160 --> 13:34.940
game that's out. We have a lot of dance games to give away. Are we going to give away some

13:34.940 --> 13:39.800
non-dance games in the coming weeks, Loki? Yes, yes we are. Okay. Obviously we love dance

13:39.800 --> 13:43.340
games, but we've got to give away some other stuff too. Anyway, this is a copy of In the

13:43.340 --> 13:48.640
the Groove that has been autographed by all the hosts here at Orange Lounge Radio and

13:48.640 --> 13:54.820
what you had to do was write a haiku about In the Groove and it had to be five syllables,

13:54.820 --> 13:58.680
seven syllables, three syllables, not five, seven, five because that's a horrible inside

13:58.680 --> 14:01.520
joke and Loki is going to sweeten the deal.

14:01.520 --> 14:03.040
You're throwing in something else, aren't you?

14:03.040 --> 14:08.120
I'm throwing in a t-shirt that says In the Courtroom but it's in the style of the logo

14:08.120 --> 14:12.520
for In the Groove because they got sued by Konami.

14:12.520 --> 14:18.520
Youíre going to throw in something that says ìIn the courtroom.î Then weíre also going

14:18.520 --> 14:24.320
to give away to all of our winners, not just the folks who won In the Groove. We have some

14:24.320 --> 14:29.400
Silent Hill 3 stickers that were given to us by somebody at Konami, so weíre going

14:29.400 --> 14:34.040
to give away some Silent Hill 3 stickers to those folks that won all these various prizes.

14:34.040 --> 14:38.600
We also decided to give a runner-up prize because we got so many hilarious haikus. Weíre

14:38.600 --> 14:41.980
going to give away a runner-up prize as well. Weíre just going to give away some assorted

14:41.980 --> 14:46.260
soundtracks that we have. I think we've got some, I want to say a Resident Evil soundtrack

14:46.260 --> 14:47.260
or something.

14:47.260 --> 14:48.260
And ESPN.

14:48.260 --> 14:53.160
Yeah, so we're going to give away those soundtracks to our runner-up. Let's find out who won.

14:53.160 --> 14:58.340
The runner-up, here is the haiku that is the runner-up in the in the Groove haiku contest.

14:58.340 --> 15:06.340
Minds, mods, and much more. In the Groove will help you score, just not dates.

15:06.340 --> 15:07.340
That was brilliant.

15:07.340 --> 15:08.340
That was great. That's our runner-up.

15:08.340 --> 15:09.340
It actually had a rhyme in it.

15:09.340 --> 15:13.980
Yeah, that's good. That's our runner-up, Asian Buddy Paul. Asian Buddy Paul is our runner-up.

15:13.980 --> 15:23.180
Congratulations. And here is our winner. You want a haiku? Maybe about In the Groove? They

15:23.180 --> 15:30.220
got sued. That was the best. That was Justin M. is our winner of the In the Groove contest.

15:30.220 --> 15:34.780
Congratulations. Yay. All right. Good job, guys. We did get lots of good ones. We did

15:34.780 --> 15:38.860
get lots of good ones. You guys crack us up, so good job. We have to do more creativity

15:38.860 --> 15:39.860
competitions.

15:39.860 --> 15:40.860
Absolutely.

15:40.860 --> 15:44.500
Encouraging people to use their brains and think independently is always good.

15:44.500 --> 15:45.500
Absolutely.

15:45.500 --> 15:46.500
Of course.

15:46.500 --> 15:48.020
Alright, let's get into some gaming news tonight.

15:48.020 --> 15:52.580
We're going to start off with some news about the Xbox 360.

15:52.580 --> 15:58.620
GameSpot actually ran a report earlier this week that the Xbox Chief Officer Robbie Bach

15:58.620 --> 16:05.360
expects half of all Xbox 360 owners to be on Xbox Live.

16:05.360 --> 16:09.360
In the article, it goes on to say that only about 10% of current Xbox users, which would

16:09.360 --> 16:13.600
be about 2 million people, use the current version of Xbox Live, but because theyíre

16:13.600 --> 16:19.480
going to have this free silver version of Xbox Live thatís going to be on the 360,

16:19.480 --> 16:24.800
the chief officer there believes that 50% of the users will go on because itís free.

16:24.800 --> 16:28.280
And to me, I kind of think, ìWell, duh, yeah, if itís free, more people are going to use

16:28.280 --> 16:30.880
it.î I actually think 50% is kind of low.

16:30.880 --> 16:34.760
I think more people are wired this day and age for Internet access, high speed.

16:34.760 --> 16:37.400
I think that they could maybe get more people on it.

16:37.400 --> 16:40.640
He's not accounting for consumer apathy.

16:40.640 --> 16:41.640
Maybe.

16:41.640 --> 16:42.640
Maybe.

16:42.640 --> 16:45.640
I don't know.

16:45.640 --> 16:48.400
It seems to me like there's a possibility for distortion here, because if the only way

16:48.400 --> 16:54.400
that you can really play the games online is to do the Xbox Gold, because we did this

16:54.400 --> 16:55.400
a few weeks back.

16:55.400 --> 16:57.140
We were talking about the differences between silver and gold.

16:57.140 --> 17:00.120
Silver just basically got you on there and you could communicate with people, but you

17:00.120 --> 17:01.640
couldn't really play them, right?

17:01.640 --> 17:02.640
You have to go gold for that.

17:02.640 --> 17:03.640
That would be correct.

17:03.640 --> 17:07.080
they end up saying that 70% of the people are on Xbox Live. Well, does that mean 70%

17:07.080 --> 17:11.720
of the people are playing games on there? No, so I don't know. I don't know how much

17:11.720 --> 17:12.720
weight this story holds.

17:12.720 --> 17:13.720
It's a huge number, that's all.

17:13.720 --> 17:16.880
I was kind of surprised this story got as much attention as it did, because I'm like,

17:16.880 --> 17:19.760
so, if it's free, people are going to use it. I don't know.

17:19.760 --> 17:22.320
I think that wins the award of the evening.

17:22.320 --> 17:27.280
We'll see. We'll see. Dark Soccer, you actually had a story about the Xbox 360's launch as

17:27.280 --> 17:28.280
well, didn't you?

17:28.280 --> 17:36.200
Actually, I got an email from one of our listeners, one of our regular writers as well, from Rob

17:36.200 --> 17:39.080
with Two Bees.

17:39.080 --> 17:43.400
I'm just going to go ahead and read this email real quick, just because I think it's very

17:43.400 --> 17:46.920
well written and brings up a good point.

17:46.920 --> 17:50.760
It's been hitting the internet gaming news about Microsoft rejecting the Blu-ray DVD

17:50.760 --> 17:51.760
format.

17:51.760 --> 17:54.980
I'm not really interested in the reasons, but rather why it's an issue at all, so maybe

17:54.980 --> 17:56.800
the crew can help me with that.

17:56.800 --> 17:59.980
I actually thought it would be a good thing to bring up for discussion.

17:59.980 --> 18:04.620
Unless you have three hours of video, why would one DVD be insufficient for a game?

18:04.620 --> 18:08.260
The reason I ask myself this is how can there be so much code

18:08.260 --> 18:12.400
and support files to engulf an entire DVD? The compiled code itself should be a

18:12.400 --> 18:14.280
fraction of the entire content,

18:14.280 --> 18:18.280
but I've noticed that games of

18:18.280 --> 18:21.360
practically the same complexity as Tetris

18:21.360 --> 18:25.480
are three megabytes and higher. This can only mean developer kits, uncompressed

18:25.480 --> 18:30.160
files and non-optimized code. I'd be the first to admit that devkits are necessary, but why

18:30.160 --> 18:33.920
are companies compiling all of the libraries into a game that use less than half of all

18:33.920 --> 18:38.200
the features? There's no one answer to that question. It's most likely a combination of

18:38.200 --> 18:43.280
sufficient documentation, closed source code, programming shops, and the acceptance of software

18:43.280 --> 18:49.520
that barely meets the expected performance. All of that excepted, it still has to be unnecessarily

18:49.520 --> 18:53.680
large support files that really push them over the edge. Overly large and or detailed

18:53.680 --> 18:59.680
bitmaps compressed along with the code instead of as bitmaps. The same with video and sound.

18:59.680 --> 19:04.640
It may not use more of the file specific compression algorithms. It brings me to a conclusion that

19:04.640 --> 19:08.740
if the file fills more than a DVD, you may want to reconsider your content. Make sure

19:08.740 --> 19:14.800
that you�re not adding fluff to distract the player from the core game is absolutely

19:14.800 --> 19:18.520
piece of crap. Almost every movie licensed game fits this description.

19:18.520 --> 19:23.200
Interesting. You know, my initial thought as to why you would need so much space though

19:23.200 --> 19:27.560
is that isn't the Xbox 360, if I'm not mistaken, isn't Microsoft forcing all the Xbox 360 games

19:27.560 --> 19:29.600
to be high-def compatible?

19:29.600 --> 19:30.820
I believe so.

19:30.820 --> 19:36.520
Which I think is a good thing. Nintendo, are you listening? And that would take up more

19:36.520 --> 19:37.760
space by default, I would think.

19:37.760 --> 19:39.240
I don't think it would take up a whole DVD.

19:39.240 --> 19:43.960
Well, I think the thing is when you're pushing these higher-res games, you're going to have

19:43.960 --> 19:48.060
higher-res textures. More of them, if you've seen Project Anthem Racing, they mean whole

19:48.060 --> 19:52.160
buildings are textured. Of course, it takes up more space. It's not coding that's going

19:52.160 --> 19:58.040
to take up space at all. Coding is tiny. It's basically all these textures and audio and

19:58.040 --> 20:03.020
stuff that you've got. I don't even know how many channels of audio you've got on the 360

20:03.020 --> 20:09.500
and stuff, 5.1 and everything. It's the difference between why a DVD video file is 4 gigs and

20:09.500 --> 20:15.420
a DivX file is only 600 megs. In quality, you're going to see a big difference there

20:15.420 --> 20:19.260
too. Blu-ray, the only reason they're not going with Blu-ray is because Sony is the

20:19.260 --> 20:23.700
one thatís making Blu-ray so, duh, theyíre not going to support their competitor.

20:23.700 --> 20:28.420
I agree though with whatís being said about it really comes down to the quality of games.

20:28.420 --> 20:32.420
You know, thereís going to be those crap games that donít make good use of the space,

20:32.420 --> 20:36.500
but I really think there will be games out there that are just going to have some stunning

20:36.500 --> 20:41.600
cut scenes and things that could take up, you know, feasibly more room than a normal

20:41.600 --> 20:46.300
DVD could handle. I donít know if there will be any launch titles, but you know, I think

20:46.300 --> 20:50.940
down the line if there's that room for expansion, naturally the games have to grow.

20:50.940 --> 20:56.220
Well, I also got another email that's sort of the converse of that. One of our other

20:56.220 --> 21:03.800
listeners, Tony, brought to our attention this. Something about Volision recently stating

21:03.800 --> 21:07.820
that their 360 game Saints Row will not have flyable aircraft because they can't stream

21:07.820 --> 21:14.220
the hard drive data fast enough from the disk. They will have to use the hard drive, but

21:14.220 --> 21:17.920
I'm just quoting here, as we know developers can't assume the hard drive will always be

21:17.920 --> 21:18.920
there for the 360.

21:18.920 --> 21:22.720
So, the question is, do you see this as a growing trend where we're going to see more

21:22.720 --> 21:27.640
eye candy and less game play?

21:27.640 --> 21:29.200
I think unfortunately that's kind of...

21:29.200 --> 21:30.200
I think it's kind of...

21:30.200 --> 21:31.200
It's happening already.

21:31.200 --> 21:32.200
I think it's been a trend that's been happening already.

21:32.200 --> 21:33.200
Absolutely.

21:33.200 --> 21:34.200
I think there's games...

21:34.200 --> 21:36.680
But, you know, sometimes there's games out there that have a lot of good eye candy, but

21:36.680 --> 21:39.000
they have good game play too, like Xenosaga comes to mind.

21:39.000 --> 21:42.700
I mean, God, that game was like half just sit and watch the cut scenes, but it was still

21:42.700 --> 21:54.780
a good game, but I think what he said there about the movie franchise games are some of

21:54.780 --> 21:56.260
the biggest culprits of that stuff.

21:56.260 --> 21:59.180
Not always, but usually the biggest culprits of that stuff, I think he made an excellent

21:59.180 --> 22:00.180
point with that.

22:00.180 --> 22:03.460
I think those games have always been about the eye candy a lot of times and making you

22:03.460 --> 22:06.660
remember the movie and things.

22:06.660 --> 22:11.100
I think it's kind of a trend that's going on already and I think it will just continue

22:11.100 --> 22:12.100
to go.

22:12.100 --> 22:17.580
that was the big thing that spawned the whole, oh, PlayStation is better than Saturn bullshit

22:17.580 --> 22:22.500
of a few years ago. The thing is, though, is that most of the people that were saying

22:22.500 --> 22:27.540
that never imported a single Saturn game, and were not 2D gamers.

22:27.540 --> 22:30.180
I think this goes all the way back to Super Nintendo. Remember those games that would

22:30.180 --> 22:32.320
horror mode 7? Yeah.

22:32.320 --> 22:37.420
And there was really nothing else to it. It was just, oh, look at the pretty mode 7.

22:37.420 --> 22:43.020
But then again, the Super Nintendo, you know, they had, they were one of the first systems

22:43.020 --> 22:44.020
to do polygons.

22:44.020 --> 22:45.020
True.

22:45.020 --> 22:49.020
Although, actually, there was a system out before that that did it, but not in America.

22:49.020 --> 22:55.860
The PC Engine Duo had a game called Sapphire that was one of their arcade card games, which

22:55.860 --> 23:00.260
that system was so intelligent to have those upgradeable cards to support the different

23:00.260 --> 23:01.260
games.

23:01.260 --> 23:03.540
But I've played this game.

23:03.540 --> 23:09.340
It's got really pretty graphics in it for its time, and in-game polygons.

23:09.340 --> 23:12.580
There were some great mode 7 games, such as pilot wings, I loved, and some of the other

23:12.580 --> 23:13.580
older ones.

23:13.580 --> 23:17.780
We had Star Fox, I mean, even FX in, like, Dracula X.

23:17.780 --> 23:21.280
But see, you had the Star Fox game, but then there was some buggy racing game or something

23:21.280 --> 23:22.280
that was stupid.

23:22.280 --> 23:23.280
I didn't like it.

23:23.280 --> 23:24.280
Stunt Race FX.

23:24.280 --> 23:25.280
Stunt Race FX.

23:25.280 --> 23:26.280
Yeah, that was one of them.

23:26.280 --> 23:27.280
I didn't like that.

23:27.280 --> 23:32.280
But some of the other races, F-Zero.

23:32.280 --> 23:33.280
Sure.

23:33.280 --> 23:40.280
We got to move on though. If you want to email us, send us an email at togo at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

23:40.280 --> 23:42.280
We'll get to some more emails a little later in the show, yes?

23:42.280 --> 23:43.280
All right.

23:43.280 --> 23:47.280
Loki, you had a story about now the Xbox 360. There was some type of teaser site going on

23:47.280 --> 23:50.560
and the countdown finished this week. What happened?

23:50.560 --> 24:00.400
Origin Xbox360.com. It would have been great if you live in the UK because guess what?

24:00.400 --> 24:08.040
it's a UK launch site. Basically, you can enter to win a trip to the launch party that's

24:08.040 --> 24:13.720
in Vegas, if I remember correctly, or New York in the United States, but you have to

24:13.720 --> 24:18.140
be in the UK in order to enter this. Basically, the website was teasing it with some cutout

24:18.140 --> 24:23.640
pictures of rabbits and this giant tree that was growing. At the very end, you have these

24:23.640 --> 24:27.720
rabbits and the whole thing reminds me of Monty Python, the way it's done. Basically,

24:27.720 --> 24:32.080
the rabbits, one of them eats the fruit that makes them hallucinate, and then you go to

24:32.080 --> 24:36.600
the maiden site. It was a complete letdown. We were thinking it was going to be something

24:36.600 --> 24:39.440
cool, but unless you were in the UK, it was not.

24:39.440 --> 24:43.560
But we do have listeners in the UK, so hey.

24:43.560 --> 24:45.720
Hey, good for you guys. Congratulations.

24:45.720 --> 24:51.600
It's a great site. It's cute. It has rabbits that talk and little bunny things. I love

24:51.600 --> 24:58.600
bunnies and then 10 bunnies would be good, but the problem is they multiply too fast.

24:58.600 --> 25:04.840
Yeah, I don't know. It was a really cool site. Unfortunately, it's only for the U.K.

25:04.840 --> 25:10.180
The punchline sucked, in other words. It was really dumb because the whole thing,

25:10.180 --> 25:14.060
if you have a launch site like this and you're basically making it seem like, oh, the world's

25:14.060 --> 25:19.760
connected, except for you people in the U.S., you're not connected to the world, so forget

25:19.760 --> 25:20.760
you.

25:20.760 --> 25:25.000
Well speaking, now we talk a lot about release dates in the US for games here on the show,

25:25.000 --> 25:30.040
but Dark Sakura once in a while likes to give our UK listeners, because we have a pretty

25:30.040 --> 25:33.400
big group there that listens, and thanks to you guys in the UK that listen, not just there,

25:33.400 --> 25:37.440
but we have folks in Australia, Asia, all over the world listening to this program.

25:37.440 --> 25:40.800
Love you guys, unfortunately we can't go over everybody's calendar, but we do once in a

25:40.800 --> 25:44.240
while like to go over the UK's calendar, and Dark Sakura wants to let you guys know what's

25:44.240 --> 25:46.600
going on for the release calendar in Europe.

25:46.600 --> 25:51.120
We have a number of games coming out this week, Black and White 2 for the PC, Armored

25:51.120 --> 26:02.440
Core Nexus, Geist, King of Fighters 2003 for Xbox, Nintendogs is coming out in the UK on

26:02.440 --> 26:09.920

26:31.400 --> 26:36.280

26:36.280 --> 26:40.960
21st getting Dragon Ball Z budakai tenkaichi I'm actually boom budakai tenkaichi

26:40.960 --> 26:44.720
hasn't come out yet it's not coming out until November

26:44.720 --> 26:48.320
According to Eurogamer, their release is October 21st for the UK.

26:48.320 --> 26:48.920
Lucky them.

26:48.920 --> 26:52.320
Yeah, because November it's not coming out until, I think, the second or third week.

26:52.320 --> 26:52.820
It's a good thing-

26:52.820 --> 26:53.620
Oh, wait, no, wait!

26:53.620 --> 26:54.920
No, I'm sorry, that was October.

26:54.920 --> 26:56.420
We're getting it a week later, though.

26:56.420 --> 26:58.820
It's a good thing I could care less about Dragon Ball Z.

26:58.820 --> 27:01.720
Genji is also coming out, which is actually a game that I have at home.

27:01.720 --> 27:03.220
And we did bring a pack and roll earlier.

27:03.220 --> 27:04.520
They get it on the 28th.

27:04.520 --> 27:05.020
All right.

27:05.020 --> 27:06.620
Zen Osaka Episode 2, also on the 28th.

27:06.620 --> 27:10.520
If you know a place that rents DS games, seriously, rent Before You Buy on that one.

27:10.520 --> 27:13.920
I think it's one of those ones you'll love it or you'll not.

27:13.920 --> 27:14.920
Alright, thank you.

27:14.920 --> 27:15.920
You're welcome.

27:15.920 --> 27:16.920
Cool.

27:16.920 --> 27:21.960
Let's move on to, I've got to ask Loki, kind of our hack and crack guy, I don't

27:21.960 --> 27:26.280
follow the hack scene so much, but obviously I heard the big news about the 2.0 downgrade.

27:26.280 --> 27:27.280
What happened?

27:27.280 --> 27:35.540
Okay, so the people that found that bug to begin with, in the 2.0 firmware, basically

27:35.540 --> 27:40.520
be able to launch their own code by doing a buffer overflow.

27:40.520 --> 27:46.220
They basically created this program to make the PSP think that's version 1.0.

27:46.220 --> 27:51.160
When you do that, then you can run the version 1.5 update and basically downgrade your entire

27:51.160 --> 27:52.840
PSP.

27:52.840 --> 27:55.580
This method has been posted all over the place.

27:55.580 --> 28:02.120
I think it started off at psphacks.com is where they originally posted it.

28:02.120 --> 28:08.600
Basically everyone that had version 1.51 or 1.52 or even a 2.0, they've been downgrading

28:08.600 --> 28:14.360
to play the homebrew stuff again. So, what would you expect Sony to do? Yes, they released

28:14.360 --> 28:15.360
version 2.01.

28:15.360 --> 28:19.800
No surprise there. So now, so if you were thinking about going back and forth between

28:19.800 --> 28:25.820
2.0 and 1.5, it's going to be hard to get on 2.0 now, unless you know where to get.

28:25.820 --> 28:29.840
Not exactly. If you're the one that's in the homebrew site, they do have links to the firmware.

28:29.840 --> 28:33.300
They do keep copies on their servers for the Japanese and stuff, so.

28:33.300 --> 28:37.820
Not surprised Sony ticked off about this, although you'd think they'd embrace the homebrew

28:37.820 --> 28:38.820
thing a little more.

28:38.820 --> 28:39.820
No.

28:39.820 --> 28:40.820
You'd think they'd take advantage of it.

28:40.820 --> 28:42.460
They'd take advantage of it, at least, you know?

28:42.460 --> 28:43.460
I don't know.

28:43.460 --> 28:46.380
I was telling my guy that, you know, represents H-Tech, I'm like, why aren't they coming

28:46.380 --> 28:48.620
out with RPG Maker for the end of the PSP?

28:48.620 --> 28:50.180
I'm like, it'd be freaking sweet.

28:50.180 --> 28:51.900
You'd put your own textures and stuff in there.

28:51.900 --> 28:53.960
You can distribute your games online.

28:53.960 --> 28:56.100
It's homebrew, but it's legal.

28:56.100 --> 28:57.500
I mean, what more would you want?

28:57.500 --> 29:02.620
But I always found it interesting that, like, in the 2.0 upgrade, there were things, like,

29:02.620 --> 29:05.940
remember there was a hack a few months ago before 2.0 came out that would allow you to

29:05.940 --> 29:10.180
changed the background on your PSP and then they implemented that in 2.0. I thought that

29:10.180 --> 29:11.180
was kind of interesting.

29:11.180 --> 29:17.300
Yeah, there's stuff like that, but that's the thing though. The other reason is people

29:17.300 --> 29:20.820
are only really upgrading to use the web browser, but when you think about it, the web browser

29:20.820 --> 29:26.580
is kind of useless anyways. I don't know, there's not a lot of sites that support it

29:26.580 --> 29:32.340
right now. It doesn't support Flash and it's really limited on, it doesn't support Java.

29:32.340 --> 29:37.980
us, so it's like, they're teething, oh, well, maybe future firmware updates will implement

29:37.980 --> 29:42.220
that. Well, thank you for releasing something crippled for us. Thank you. Appreciate it.

29:42.220 --> 29:45.940
Yeah, a good way for them to cover their tracks when this kind of stuff comes up, though.

29:45.940 --> 29:51.540
But the whole thing is, they're working with Homebrew on even the 2.0, and if they get

29:51.540 --> 29:54.840
smart enough, they're going to figure out how to just rip stuff out of the different

29:54.840 --> 29:58.260
updates and build their own update. That's what's going to happen.

29:58.260 --> 29:59.260
Interesting.

29:59.260 --> 30:03.100
And speaking of updates, I have to warn a few people here.

30:03.100 --> 30:09.020
There was something going around actually that was basically saying it's a patcher

30:09.020 --> 30:18.460
that will fix your PHP to add the browser in there as well.

30:18.460 --> 30:22.900
And it's basically this patcher that's been going around, I don't know who is releasing

30:22.900 --> 30:29.140
a PSP team supposedly and it will actually crash your PSP and destroy it.

30:29.140 --> 30:33.140
always got to be somebody that wants to mess it up for everybody else.

30:33.140 --> 30:40.060
So yeah, don't download that but do find the big links for it. It's out there.

30:40.060 --> 30:45.500
Now speaking of the PSP, we here at Orange Lounge Radio have a pretty hefty announcement

30:45.500 --> 30:50.420
and I think it's time to mention what it is. Loki, what is going on Orange Lounge Radio

30:50.420 --> 30:51.420
PSP wise?

30:51.420 --> 30:56.480
Well, everybody's having the PSP and those people do have the 2.0 browser or A web browser

30:56.480 --> 31:00.580
out there that they're using on the PSP or looking for more portals and links and stuff

31:00.580 --> 31:02.960
like that.

31:02.960 --> 31:09.240
We here at Orange Launch Radio decided it's time to get with things and we like to be

31:09.240 --> 31:15.540
innovative and jumped on the whole podcasting thing right when it was getting started here.

31:15.540 --> 31:23.400
So now we actually will be announcing the launch of OLRPSP.com, which will be our PSP

31:23.400 --> 31:24.400
formatted site.

31:24.400 --> 31:29.020
find links to download a podcast straight to your PSP. Weíre going to have downloads

31:29.020 --> 31:33.820
just like we have a wallpaper on there now that you can download for it. And plus youíll

31:33.820 --> 31:39.060
be able to keep up with the news that we have and a lot of other things, just more features.

31:39.060 --> 31:46.060
So thatís OLRPSP.com. Now you can visit this on a PC but on your regular Internet Explorer

31:46.060 --> 31:50.620
500, itís going to look kind of crappy because this site is formatted for your PSP. This

31:50.620 --> 31:53.740
is specifically for those folks.

31:53.740 --> 31:58.620
it looks kind of okay on a... It's okay, but if you're wondering why it

31:58.620 --> 32:01.620
looks all funky, it's because it's specifically for a PSP.

32:01.620 --> 32:03.860
It looks pretty good if you have a high-definition screen.

32:03.860 --> 32:07.660
Oh yeah, oh yeah. Yeah, it looks really nice.

32:07.660 --> 32:12.980
Loki and VX Jason XV, our tech guy behind the scenes, you guys did an incredible job

32:12.980 --> 32:15.860
on this and I think people are going to love it because I love the way you guys designed

32:15.860 --> 32:19.140
the site. You didn't make it. You used a lot of image maps in your design

32:19.140 --> 32:23.300
and I think that's a great way to browse on the PSP, so check it out guys.

32:23.300 --> 32:28.760
And I've got my 2.0 PSP that I was actually testing it with right as I'm making it so

32:28.760 --> 32:33.980
make sure that everything worked, that it looked nice. And it just works awesome. And

32:33.980 --> 32:38.740
the first wallpaper we have, I have it on my PSP. It looks nice. It doesn't detract

32:38.740 --> 32:42.460
from the icons so you can see everything. And ironically enough, it worked out that

32:42.460 --> 32:44.620
way but it's just really cool.

32:44.620 --> 32:47.540
Let's check that out, OLRPSP.com.

32:47.540 --> 32:51.060
No WWW, remember folks, because otherwise that won't work.

32:51.060 --> 32:52.060
Really?

32:52.060 --> 32:58.420
All right, check that out. All right, moving on. Let's go to another story

32:58.420 --> 33:05.860
here. I have a story about Disgaea 2. A lot of folks are really into Disgaea. Cute story.

33:05.860 --> 33:11.860
Very cute story to it and a very interesting game there. Disgaea 2 has been announced in

33:11.860 --> 33:20.460
the latest issue of Dengeki PS2. It's going to be out for 2006. That is going to be what

33:20.460 --> 33:27.800
is coming out, and the Etna, Devil Girl Etna, and the Prinnies, the little penguin guys,

33:27.800 --> 33:35.280
they will be coming back in the next Disgaea as well. Some cameos as well of characters

33:35.280 --> 33:42.000
from Makai Kingdom, which was another game in that same series, I believe, or at least

33:42.000 --> 33:43.880
from the same developer. Yeah, it's the same series.

33:43.880 --> 33:49.120
That was the, what game? Not La Poussel, that was a different game.

33:49.120 --> 33:56.000
Monkei Tencho? Yeah. Monkei Kingdom. So check that out there, it's going to be a very similar

33:56.000 --> 34:02.480
game with the combo system and everything is coming back. So that's Disgaea 2. Let's

34:02.480 --> 34:07.800
go on to, I think what we should do now, we've talked an awful lot about a lot of games so

34:07.800 --> 34:13.300
far, haven't we? Yeah. So I think what we need to do, we need to talk about some real

34:13.300 --> 34:18.120
life things. And you know, we here at Orange Lounge Radio, we can't play video games all

34:18.120 --> 34:22.360
all day long because if we played video games all day long, we'd have no time to design

34:22.360 --> 34:28.040
websites. So DarkSakura is here to remind you guys there is a whole world out there

34:28.040 --> 34:32.600
and she would like to give you some advice to help you survive in the world. So DarkSakura,

34:32.600 --> 34:38.520
what are you going to talk to the kids about tonight? Today's bit of advice is how to survive

34:38.520 --> 34:45.120
a bird attack. Like in the Hitchcock movie? Yeah. Okay. There's even, I even have a picture

34:45.120 --> 34:46.920
that looks like it's from the birds.

34:46.920 --> 34:49.560
Number one, watch for hovering and clacking.

34:49.560 --> 34:52.400
If you observe this behavior, be ready for an attack.

34:52.400 --> 34:54.880
Two, close your eyes and cover your ears.

34:54.880 --> 34:57.040
The birds will swoop down quickly, striking at the head

34:57.040 --> 34:59.280
or shoulders with its wings or beak.

34:59.280 --> 35:02.880
Three, run for cover away from nesting and foraging areas.

35:02.880 --> 35:04.960
Run as fast as you can away from the areas

35:04.960 --> 35:06.480
that the bird is protecting.

35:06.480 --> 35:08.560
Many species of birds will attack if their nests

35:08.560 --> 35:11.560
or foraging areas are disturbed, even incidentally.

35:11.560 --> 35:13.520
If a bird attacks, it will continue to attack

35:13.520 --> 35:19.640
until you leave these areas. But my final bit of advice is don't wander onto the set

35:19.640 --> 35:20.640
of Hitchcock remakes.

35:20.640 --> 35:25.640
And also, they're birds. I mean, come on. You should be able to fight off birds. They're

35:25.640 --> 35:26.640
small.

35:26.640 --> 35:29.120
When they say, don't feed the pigeons, they effin' mean it.

35:29.120 --> 35:33.920
It's just a bird. It's not like a giant duck or goose or something. I mean, if you have

35:33.920 --> 35:35.960
like a flock of geese or something that are...

35:35.960 --> 35:36.960
A flock of seagulls.

35:36.960 --> 35:41.240
Or a flock of, well, seagulls are just pathetic. I mean, they'll drop dead when you give them

35:41.240 --> 35:46.320
you know, Alka-Seltzer, but seriously, I mean, they're birds. I was attacked by a flock of

35:46.320 --> 35:49.980
seagulls once, and you know what? I ran. I ran so far away.

35:49.980 --> 35:55.600
Did it give you bad hair? Stop. Loki, you've got a story about the Nintendo

35:55.600 --> 36:01.520
Wi-Fi DS system that's coming up, and I'm really excited about this. I am so excited

36:01.520 --> 36:07.160
about the DS Wi-Fi. I hope this isn't just one of those things that's a good theory on

36:07.160 --> 36:10.560
paper, but I really hope Nintendo doesn't let me down on this, but this is going to

36:10.560 --> 36:15.060
bigger than I thought. I thought this was just gonna be Animal Crossing and Mario Kart,

36:15.060 --> 36:16.060
but not the case.

36:16.060 --> 36:21.120
Now, they have a lot of things announced for it, actually. The Nintendo Wi-Fi site actually

36:21.120 --> 36:27.480
launched, by launched I mean there's a teaser page there now. So basically, if you go to

36:27.480 --> 36:34.580
NintendoWifi.com and you check it out, their wonderful logo for it. The games that they're

36:34.580 --> 36:40.620
seeing that are going to be utilizing the Wi-Fi. They have a huge list here. This is

36:40.620 --> 36:46.600
only partial too. It's of course Animal Crossing, Bomberman, which is a surprise. I'm assuming

36:46.600 --> 36:48.220
that's the Bomberman that came out already.

36:48.220 --> 36:50.020
Maybe there's another one. I don't know.

36:50.020 --> 36:55.560
There might be another one. I haven't heard of one. Castlevania DS, which that's coming

36:55.560 --> 37:02.820
out in a couple of days here. We have Contact, which I hope is not a game based on the really

37:02.820 --> 37:03.820
crappy movie.

37:03.820 --> 37:05.520
I somehow doubt it.

37:05.520 --> 37:11.040
Digimon World, of course, you can probably make a DS version.

37:11.040 --> 37:15.340
Dynasty Warriors DS, which I heard was actually pushed back to who knows when.

37:15.340 --> 37:16.580
Some really good ones.

37:16.580 --> 37:18.900
Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles DS, which is pretty cool.

37:18.900 --> 37:22.660
I hope that's playable, that would be great.

37:22.660 --> 37:24.580
Mario Kart DS, of course, no surprise.

37:24.580 --> 37:28.860
Metro Prime Hunters, which isn't even coming out until next year.

37:28.860 --> 37:33.620
Let's see here, Super Monkey Ball DS, which whoop-a-dee-doo.

37:33.620 --> 37:38.840
Tony Hawk's American Skateland, which is the DS version of American Wasteland, but they

37:38.840 --> 37:41.040
did their own specific version for it.

37:41.040 --> 37:47.800
Topspin 2, Tenchu DS, then they have some generic card games, they have Ultimate Card

37:47.800 --> 37:52.240
Games and Ultimate Brain Games, and then World Soccer Winnie 11 DS.

37:52.240 --> 37:53.240
Cool.

37:53.240 --> 37:58.960
For the Record, Contact is by Goichi Tsuda, who is the director of Capcom's Killer 7.

37:58.960 --> 38:00.960
Oh, it's that game.

38:00.960 --> 38:01.960
That's weird.

38:01.960 --> 38:02.960
That's weird.

38:02.960 --> 38:04.520
No, it shouldn't suck.

38:04.520 --> 38:05.520
Good.

38:05.520 --> 38:07.400
No Jodie Foster.

38:07.400 --> 38:11.720
This isn't launching until November, but hey, that's when Mario Kart is coming out.

38:11.720 --> 38:12.720
That's pretty exciting.

38:12.720 --> 38:13.720
What's the website for that?

38:13.720 --> 38:14.720
The teaser site?

38:14.720 --> 38:15.720
Nintendo.com?

38:15.720 --> 38:16.720
NintendoWifi.com.

38:16.720 --> 38:17.720
NintendoWifi.com.

38:17.720 --> 38:18.720
Check it out.

38:18.720 --> 38:19.720
Okay.

38:19.720 --> 38:20.720
Let's talk about...

38:20.720 --> 38:24.040
I have some movie-related news.

38:24.040 --> 38:26.920
I don't know why, but we seem to always talk about movies on this program.

38:26.920 --> 38:28.680
I saw the trailer for this one.

38:28.680 --> 38:29.680
What?

38:29.680 --> 38:30.680
Actually, I didn't even...

38:30.680 --> 38:32.340
What are you thinking?

38:32.340 --> 38:33.340
This is Grandmaís Boy.

38:33.340 --> 38:38.540
I didnít even realize the trailer was out already.

38:38.540 --> 38:41.340
It is a brand new Adam Sandler movie thatís coming out now.

38:41.340 --> 38:44.660
Why would we care here on a video game show about an Adam Sandler movie?

38:44.660 --> 38:51.580
Because in the film, Grandmaís Boy, he plays a 36-year-old game tester and aspiring developer,

38:51.580 --> 38:55.580
and itís about Adam Sandlerís stuff.

38:55.580 --> 38:56.580
Itís funny.

38:56.580 --> 39:02.780
It's got the mom from Everybody Loves Raymond in it and she's funny, she just tortures

39:02.780 --> 39:03.780
this guy.

39:03.780 --> 39:05.460
It's really good.

39:05.460 --> 39:11.760
But yeah, it does have game testers in it and it's supposedly the most accurate depiction

39:11.760 --> 39:12.760
of game testers.

39:12.760 --> 39:13.760
Well, you know what?

39:13.760 --> 39:17.000
We're going to get some game testers on this show once the movie comes out to tell

39:17.000 --> 39:21.540
us exactly what they think because we've got some contacts.

39:21.540 --> 39:23.740
I know other than our usual people.

39:23.740 --> 39:24.740
Well, yeah.

39:24.740 --> 39:25.740
We've got a couple.

39:25.740 --> 39:28.900
put it this way, it's an Adam Sandler film. It can't be too accurate to anything, so...

39:28.900 --> 39:32.700
It should be interesting. Well, here's another one. This is a little more serious of a game

39:32.700 --> 39:42.700
adaptation. Siren is going to be made into a live action film in Japan. Let's see, the

39:42.700 --> 39:52.060
film is going to be directed by Sara Yoshihiko, who made Trick and Kizoku. I hope I pronounced

39:52.060 --> 39:55.180
that right he's writing a treatment right now that's supposed to come out

39:55.180 --> 40:01.780
about February 11th when siren 2 comes out as well so it is being plotted right

40:01.780 --> 40:05.660
now to come out a siren video game you know another franchise it's getting in

40:05.660 --> 40:11.460
their own game or movie pretty soon God of War is being worked on right now

40:11.460 --> 40:16.860
that's not a surprise adaptation but you know they're gonna cast like Vin Diesel

40:16.860 --> 40:18.820
or The Rock for it.

40:18.820 --> 40:24.100
You know what I saw finally on the big screen for the first time was that trailer for Doom,

40:24.100 --> 40:25.580
which I hadn't seen yet.

40:25.580 --> 40:26.580
Yeah.

40:26.580 --> 40:29.700
I'm sorry, that first person thing?

40:29.700 --> 40:30.700
Look hokey.

40:30.700 --> 40:31.700
Yeah.

40:31.700 --> 40:33.340
They're going to use that way too much.

40:33.340 --> 40:38.660
I can understand, let's do that sequence for maybe 30 seconds of the movies to throw back

40:38.660 --> 40:39.660
to the...

40:39.660 --> 40:41.460
Yeah, you know what that reminds me of?

40:41.460 --> 40:46.660
reminds me of what was the not not a house of the dead I think it was where

40:46.660 --> 40:51.100
they had the gun so it is or whatever house of the dead yeah where they threw

40:51.100 --> 40:56.460
in actual shots from the game worst zombie movie ever yeah thank you all

40:56.460 --> 41:00.980
right did you hear about PlayStation what's going on PlayStation doing an

41:00.980 --> 41:05.380
Emmy an Emmy yeah was it one of those things that Ellen gave out on the awards

41:05.380 --> 41:09.080
because I don't remember hearing about that ten years to the day after the

41:09.080 --> 41:12.100
The original PlayStation went on sale in North America.

41:12.100 --> 41:18.340
The console has been awarded an Emmy for outstanding achievement in technology and advanced new

41:18.340 --> 41:19.340
media.

41:19.340 --> 41:25.740
You know how they always do the tech awards that aren't good enough for TV?

41:25.740 --> 41:27.620
The Oscars and the Emmys do that?

41:27.620 --> 41:31.620
Yeah, the 57th Annual Technology and Engineering Emmy Awards.

41:31.620 --> 41:34.400
That's not all that they've won.

41:34.400 --> 41:35.620
What else did they win?

41:35.620 --> 41:44.460
one banishment from the Vatican. I don't know if I consider that winning. No, but basically

41:44.460 --> 41:50.120
Sony Italy has recently put up a full page advertisement depicting some guy wearing a

41:50.120 --> 41:57.220
crown of thorns, much like Jesus. Except this guy had no beard and no mustache, right? Except

41:57.220 --> 42:02.480
this guy looks like he's a, I don't know, some... A nerd? Yeah, some nerd reject or

42:02.480 --> 42:09.080
And he has a crown of thorns made up of the PlayStation symbols, the X circle, square

42:09.080 --> 42:11.280
triangle stuff.

42:11.280 --> 42:18.280
And then the subtitle to the whole article, which I love this, Ten Years of Passion.

42:18.280 --> 42:22.260
Oh my gosh, wow.

42:22.260 --> 42:24.720
How did that get by?

42:24.720 --> 42:26.200
I don't think it did.

42:26.200 --> 42:29.900
The Vatican took exception.

42:29.900 --> 42:31.840
How did that get by at Sony though?

42:31.840 --> 42:34.840
The entirety of Sega Corporate excommunicated now.

42:34.840 --> 42:35.840
Wow, wow, wow.

42:35.840 --> 42:38.840
Yeah, they've actually had it pulled out of the Vatican.

42:38.840 --> 42:39.840
You think?

42:39.840 --> 42:41.840
They executed their Vatican powers.

42:41.840 --> 42:43.840
All right.

42:43.840 --> 42:47.840
Moving on, we promised earlier in the show we'd get to some more of your emails, so if

42:47.840 --> 42:52.840
you have an email for us, you can always send us one at togo, T-O-G-O, at orangelaunchradio.com.

42:52.840 --> 42:57.840
And Dark Sakura's going to rip open the mailbag violently and salvage some letters to read

42:57.840 --> 42:58.840
on air.

42:58.840 --> 43:00.840
Dash, dash, ripped hair.

43:00.840 --> 43:08.180
Xteen Bits sent us an email, a correction about Panorama Cotton stating that it's just

43:08.180 --> 43:11.140
fairly uncommon and that there were several thousand.

43:11.140 --> 43:15.460
I tend to exaggerate with that game because I have had no luck finding a copy for less

43:15.460 --> 43:16.460
than $500.

43:16.460 --> 43:19.020
I'm impressed somebody out there actually knew what the game was.

43:19.020 --> 43:20.460
I sure as hell never heard of it.

43:20.460 --> 43:21.460
Panorama Cotton is fun.

43:21.460 --> 43:22.460
I never heard of it.

43:22.460 --> 43:27.180
Although, it actually does give me sort of motion sickness and Rainbow Cotton didn't

43:27.180 --> 43:32.180
which is really weird because usually it has to be the 3D game that makes me motion sick.

43:32.180 --> 43:35.140
While we're on the subject of corrections, I actually have to correct something too because

43:35.140 --> 43:36.140
I got an email about that.

43:36.140 --> 43:37.140
Tsk, tsk.

43:37.140 --> 43:41.220
I know. DJ Rama S. wants to know that the Miyamoto meet, which we talked about last

43:41.220 --> 43:47.220
week, the article that I was referencing talked about that it was going to be the first 10

43:47.220 --> 43:51.620
people would get to do bark mode with Miyamoto's dog, but unfortunately if you think about

43:51.620 --> 43:55.660
the way bark mode works, there's no way you can restrict that to just being the first

43:55.660 --> 43:58.580
10 people in line that are going to be able to do it because Bark Mode is going to pick

43:58.580 --> 44:00.500
up on any DS that's within 100 feet.

44:00.500 --> 44:05.860
So really it ended up being anybody that could get to Miyamoto's dog got to do Bark Mode

44:05.860 --> 44:07.440
with Miyamoto's dog.

44:07.440 --> 44:12.060
And so a lot of people outside actually ended up getting Miyamoto on their friends list,

44:12.060 --> 44:13.660
which I think is just awesome.

44:13.660 --> 44:17.460
Thank you DJ Ron Maest for sending in that correction.

44:17.460 --> 44:23.100
Also one of our Canadian friends, Aceman, sent a question.

44:23.100 --> 44:29.220
So I'm thinking about getting the 360 when it comes out on launch, but the thing is I don't know about the game selection

44:29.700 --> 44:33.780
Like I know which ones I'm gonna get for myself Gears of War and Dead Rising

44:33.780 --> 44:40.140
My question is are there any four player co-op games offline that you guys know of that I should pick up other than Ghost Recon?

44:41.300 --> 44:47.100
First off I'd like to mention you might think of some better games to pick because Dead Rising and Gears of War are not coming

44:47.100 --> 44:48.020
out of launch

44:48.020 --> 44:49.020
Unfortunately.

44:49.020 --> 44:50.020
Oh, ouch.

44:50.020 --> 44:52.860
Yeah, Gears of War is to be announced right now.

44:52.860 --> 44:55.740
Dead Rising has never even been on launch.

44:55.740 --> 44:59.340
However, you've got a good selection of sports games.

44:59.340 --> 45:04.100
If you're a sports fan, you have the entire 2K series and the EA series, you know, their

45:04.100 --> 45:05.100
games.

45:05.100 --> 45:08.420
If I may, I actually have the full list of launch titles in alphabet quarter.

45:08.420 --> 45:10.140
All right, go for it.

45:10.140 --> 45:14.860
Amped 3, Call of Duty, Condemned, which is Sega, I'm looking forward to that.

45:14.860 --> 45:21.860
Federal Life 4, Elder Scrolls IV, Final Fantasy XI, Full Auto,

45:21.860 --> 45:23.360
Final Fantasy XI is a launch title?

45:23.360 --> 45:25.860
They are not launch titles. That list is wrong.

45:25.860 --> 45:29.860
Well, I'm still going to read the list because these are either launch or near launch.

45:29.860 --> 45:38.860
Full Auto, Ghost Recon, Advanced Warfighter, Gun, Cameo, Elements of Power, Madden NFL,

45:38.860 --> 45:41.860
NBA 2K6, NHL 2K...blah, blah.

45:41.860 --> 45:44.860
The Outfit, Perfect Dark.

45:44.860 --> 45:50.860
Project Gotham Racing 3, Quake 4, Ridge Racer 6, Saints Row.

45:50.860 --> 45:53.860
Tony Hawk's American Wasteland, Top Spin 2.

45:53.860 --> 45:58.860
Second Wave of Launch Titles, announced by EB as of November 16th.

45:58.860 --> 46:04.860
Burnout Revenge, FIFA Soccer 06, Peter Jackson's King Kong.

46:04.860 --> 46:12.860
By the way, speaking of that, they showed a scene of King Kong to the GameStop managers and it apparently is supposed to be very awesome.

46:12.860 --> 46:18.860
NBA Live 06, Need for Speed Most Wanted, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 06.

46:18.860 --> 46:20.860
Perfect dark, isn't that a four player?

46:20.860 --> 46:22.860
Let me correct that list real quick here.

46:22.860 --> 46:27.860
King Kong is coming day and date with the PlayStation 2, Xbox versions and GameCube versions.

46:27.860 --> 46:31.860
It's launching on every single platform the same day.

46:31.860 --> 46:39.460
So, what else we have here? There was, I know Frame City Killer got pushed back to February,

46:39.460 --> 46:44.540
which was one I was looking for. I know Saints Row isn't coming out until next year. Full

46:44.540 --> 46:48.660
Auto is not coming out next year and I'm really disappointed about that. But, the ones

46:48.660 --> 46:54.580
I was definitely going to pick up, Quake 4 looks good. Project Autumn Racing 3 is going

46:54.580 --> 47:00.560
to be friggin' awesome. Need for Speed, most wanted is coming out the week before

47:00.560 --> 47:01.560
launch.

47:01.560 --> 47:05.280
November 19th release date for Framed City Killer by Namco.

47:05.280 --> 47:08.280
I got pushed back last week to February.

47:08.280 --> 47:14.160
There's also an initial price list from EB that all the games will be $59.99, except

47:14.160 --> 47:16.160
for Cameo, which is listed at $49.99.

47:16.160 --> 47:19.440
There's some other ones that are $49.99, but yeah, Cameo is one of the cheaper ones.

47:19.440 --> 47:23.840
I'm looking forward to Quake 4 and DOA 4, which is weird.

47:23.840 --> 47:28.400
I'm usually not into DOA, but for some reason, I'm looking really forward to this new one.

47:28.400 --> 47:32.040
We listed Halo 3 as being July 1, 2006.

47:32.040 --> 47:36.420
They haven't even announced anything yet, so they're stating that they're presuming

47:36.420 --> 47:40.740
it to be the same day as the PS3 release.

47:40.740 --> 47:41.740
We got to keep it moving.

47:41.740 --> 47:42.740
Any other emails?

47:42.740 --> 47:43.740
Nope.

47:43.740 --> 47:44.740
All right.

47:44.740 --> 47:45.740
We're going to close the mail bag until next week.

47:45.740 --> 47:49.720
Send us some emails to go at orangelunchroider.com.

47:49.720 --> 47:53.280
Castlevania will be going next gen.

47:53.280 --> 47:55.560
It's already in development.

47:55.560 --> 48:01.480
Koji Igarashi has confirmed that the next gen entry will happen.

48:01.480 --> 48:06.320
Honestly it shouldn't be a surprise to anybody, it's one of Konami's most successful series.

48:06.320 --> 48:11.080
But one thing you might have been curious about is that the handheld releases will continue

48:11.080 --> 48:15.880
to depict a different timeline, so the handheld releases will still be a little bit different.

48:15.880 --> 48:24.240
Curse of Darkness, Dawn of Sorrow, why was I thinking about Curse of Darkness?

48:24.240 --> 48:25.840
Game Boy Advance, I thought.

48:25.840 --> 48:28.280
Is that a new game that's coming out that I didn't even know about?

48:28.280 --> 48:31.600
Crystal Darkness is PlayStation 2 and Xbox. Remember the new one?

48:31.600 --> 48:33.440
Yeah, I guess so. Is that coming out this year?

48:33.440 --> 48:35.560
Yeah, it's coming out in October. Oh, no, wait.

48:35.560 --> 48:36.040
How did I miss that?

48:36.040 --> 48:36.680
November. I'm sorry.

48:36.680 --> 48:39.400
Wow. Somehow I wouldn't completely miss that.

48:39.400 --> 48:39.680
Yeah.

48:39.680 --> 48:42.600
That's right. I remember seeing screenshots for that. I just haven't heard a lot about it lately.

48:42.600 --> 48:43.840
For the first time, to the Xbox.

48:43.840 --> 48:47.280
Interesting. So there will also be another game coming out for the next-gen systems.

48:47.280 --> 48:51.640
Of course, we don't know which system and when, but it will be on its way.

48:51.640 --> 49:01.000
Moving on, let's talk about some stories that Loki has about Grand Theft Auto and a Grand

49:01.000 --> 49:04.120
Theft Auto-like game.

49:04.120 --> 49:08.200
First off, everybody's been waiting for the Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories, which

49:08.200 --> 49:12.520
is going to be coming out for the PSP at the end of October.

49:12.520 --> 49:17.760
One of the things that I have been wondering is, are they going to have some support for

49:17.760 --> 49:18.760
Wi-Fi?

49:18.760 --> 49:19.760
We haven't really heard anything.

49:19.760 --> 49:24.440
answer is yes they are. They will actually feature a few different modes

49:24.440 --> 49:31.200
multiplayer for up to six different players and it will basically have two

49:31.200 --> 49:35.080
that have been released so far. They said about seven modes. The first one being

49:35.080 --> 49:39.480
Liberty City Survivor which is your basic deathmatch style gameplay and

49:39.480 --> 49:45.200
Protection Racket which splits players into teams which they must protect or

49:45.200 --> 49:51.580
or destroy a number of different limousines at bases somewhere in the city. They're basically

49:51.580 --> 49:57.960
saying that multiplayer mode will be identical to single player, but you'll have more vehicles

49:57.960 --> 50:00.800
available up front and 60 different player skins.

50:00.800 --> 50:01.800
Awesome.

50:01.800 --> 50:09.740
Plus, of course, power-ups and the standard hoo-ha there. Now, of course, Microsoft can't

50:09.740 --> 50:15.000
be out of any sort of franchise, so their supposed answer to the Grand Theft Auto series

50:15.000 --> 50:23.200
is a game which, I don't know, it looks okay, but it's basically a Grand Theft Auto-ish

50:23.200 --> 50:29.680
type game with kind of a superhero character. It's Crackdown, and you're basically a super

50:29.680 --> 50:35.880
human guy who's basically cleaning up the city, and by cleaning up the city, you can

50:35.880 --> 50:44.180
steal cars, throw cars at people, just really interesting stuff. I don't know. It doesn't

50:44.180 --> 50:49.440
look that great to me. The screenshots I saw, I was like, who gives a crap? I'll pick

50:49.440 --> 50:54.600
it up because it'll be fun to play. I like throwing cards at people. But, it doesn't

50:54.600 --> 50:59.360
look that impressive. Especially looking at the other games coming out, it just looks

50:59.360 --> 51:06.640
like a third party release. It's just not really good. But, hey, beta shots, who knows?

51:06.640 --> 51:10.440
Just a couple more stories then. We've got just a couple more here. One thing I want

51:10.440 --> 51:15.280
talk about is the Mana series. Of course, Secret of Mana, Legend of Mana, all that stuff.

51:15.280 --> 51:18.800
We have Children of Mana, it's actually an RPG that's in development right now. It's

51:18.800 --> 51:23.920
going to be coming out for the Nintendo DS. That was confirmed in Famitsu Weekly Magazine

51:23.920 --> 51:29.440
this week. Don't know how it's taken advantage of having the two screens and the touch thing.

51:29.440 --> 51:33.040
All we know is that it's happening, Children of Mana. I just hope it's better than Legend

51:33.040 --> 51:37.480
of Mana because I could not, Legend of Mana ruined the series for me. I couldn't stand

51:37.480 --> 51:39.160
it. That PlayStation one was awful.

51:39.160 --> 51:44.080
My problem with Legend of Mana was the fact that I imported it in a fit of, ooh, Mana

51:44.080 --> 51:45.080
game!

51:45.080 --> 51:47.560
I like, I'm going to make this bold statement, I'll probably get Haymail for it.

51:47.560 --> 51:48.920
It was uber text heavy.

51:48.920 --> 51:52.560
I liked Secret of Evermore more than I liked Legend of Mana.

51:52.560 --> 51:53.560
Ooh!

51:53.560 --> 51:54.560
I know.

51:54.560 --> 51:55.560
That's a pretty bold statement, I realize.

51:55.560 --> 52:00.000
Legend of Mana was pretty, but I didn't read enough Japanese at the time to be able to

52:00.000 --> 52:01.440
effectively play it.

52:01.440 --> 52:06.400
Now, one of the games in the Mana series that a lot of people love is Second Detsetsu 3,

52:06.400 --> 52:08.280
which of course never made its way over here.

52:08.280 --> 52:13.560
Well, Second Densetsu 4 is in development, but we don't know which system, and we don't

52:13.560 --> 52:15.040
know really anything else about it.

52:15.040 --> 52:16.520
We just know it's happening.

52:16.520 --> 52:20.480
Neither one of these games, I should point out, is World of Mana, which was that thing

52:20.480 --> 52:23.280
they teased at E3 this year with, like, a big movie.

52:23.280 --> 52:24.560
Who knows what the heck that is?

52:24.560 --> 52:27.720
I have a hunch it's an MMO, but I could be wrong.

52:27.720 --> 52:28.720
I think it's an MMO.

52:28.720 --> 52:32.260
I think when you call something world, I have a hunch it's an MMO, but we don't know.

52:32.260 --> 52:34.600
We just don't know.

52:34.600 --> 52:41.760
story tonight, guys. Katamari Craze is spreading the nation, of course, and if you want to

52:41.760 --> 52:48.420
check out Namco's website, katamari.namco.com, if you sign up for the website, you can actually

52:48.420 --> 52:53.900
download your own little version of The Prince, who will roll a katamari across your screen

52:53.900 --> 52:59.100
at various intervals, and will play little looping music, and of course, you can actually

52:59.100 --> 53:02.120
click and drag him and throw him places and all that stuff.

53:02.120 --> 53:04.660
I used to have a goat that did that.

53:04.660 --> 53:09.660
I guess this would be fun for about five minutes and then get as annoying as those little purple

53:09.660 --> 53:10.660
bonsai buddies.

53:10.660 --> 53:12.660
Thirty seconds, actually.

53:12.660 --> 53:13.660
Really?

53:13.660 --> 53:14.660
Thirty seconds.

53:14.660 --> 53:15.660
Did you try this?

53:15.660 --> 53:16.660
Yes, I did.

53:16.660 --> 53:22.500
It replays the whole thing over and over and he just rolls the thing all over the screen,

53:22.500 --> 53:24.700
basically back and forth, back and forth, back and forth.

53:24.700 --> 53:26.020
Does he pick up your windows?

53:26.020 --> 53:29.940
I thought he would and I thought that would be awesome because I have a lot of icons he

53:29.940 --> 53:34.940
he could roll up, but he did not, and it was a great disappointment.

53:34.940 --> 53:40.340
We'll just have to send a message to the King of Cosmos for somebody to shoot some

53:40.340 --> 53:43.660
freaking laser beams out of their eyes at Namco.

53:43.660 --> 53:48.020
That just makes me really miss the little goat, because the little goat would occasionally

53:48.020 --> 53:49.020
run off to get the lucky.

53:49.020 --> 53:50.700
I've got a few last minute stories here.

53:50.700 --> 53:51.700
What's up?

53:51.700 --> 53:52.700
A couple of ones.

53:52.700 --> 53:54.160
First off, there's going to be a new Resident Evil.

53:54.160 --> 53:56.580
This one's coming out for the DS, actually.

53:56.580 --> 54:04.900
Resident Evil deadly science, ha ha, DS, oh my gosh, you people and naming your franchises,

54:04.900 --> 54:07.420
anything that will work with the DS acronym.

54:07.420 --> 54:11.620
So basically Resident Evil for DS, nothing more to see here, move along, anyways, the

54:11.620 --> 54:19.020
other thing is in November, they're going to be bundling the red DS with Mario Kart

54:19.020 --> 54:27.580
for the price of $1.49, much like you have seen with the Nintendogs, so yippee, skippy.

54:27.580 --> 54:34.100
The Red DS is already available for import. Some info about Zelda. Basically, you know

54:34.100 --> 54:38.220
how Twilight Princess was supposed to come out this year? Yeah, and it's not, and they

54:38.220 --> 54:43.180
were adding new features. Well, you know what those features are? It's basically going to

54:43.180 --> 54:48.980
be enhanced for the Nintendo Revolution. They're going to be adding, if you plug in your game

54:48.980 --> 54:52.680
cube game to the revolution you'll be able to use the wonderful revolution controller

54:52.680 --> 54:58.940
for god knows what, but that's basically why it's been pushed back. I was hoping that you'd

54:58.940 --> 55:01.880
put it on the same system, but they're not.

55:01.880 --> 55:04.180
I just think honestly they should have just done it for the revolution.

55:04.180 --> 55:08.800
The best description of that controller is on VG Cats.

55:08.800 --> 55:10.640
What's that?

55:10.640 --> 55:13.480
Basically the reaction is, I feel dirty.

55:13.480 --> 55:15.000
And the last story.

55:15.000 --> 55:16.400
You promise?

55:16.400 --> 55:24.480
I promise. The last story is Kojima clarifies that the No Place to Hide in the trailer that

55:24.480 --> 55:30.180
we saw from Metal Gear Solid 4 is about Snake's age. Basically, this doesn't take no place

55:30.180 --> 55:39.620
to hide from death. Basically, because he is a clone of Big Boss, this is only a few

55:39.620 --> 55:44.100
years later after number two so or three I guess and whatever no number two

55:44.100 --> 55:50.120
because three took place before two anyways I've gone cross-eyed anyway so

55:50.120 --> 55:53.560
they haven't really said too much else other than there's gonna be two

55:53.560 --> 55:59.980
different sides that you can either ally with still a little snatcher but it

55:59.980 --> 56:03.580
looks sexy I still need to get into Metal Gear Solid I honestly though

56:03.580 --> 56:08.620
another there's a fun parody of that on VG cats also their most recent comic

56:08.620 --> 56:12.660
it's really a solid state any money under the table or something no I just

56:12.660 --> 56:15.260
love that I just thought that that's like my favorite webcomic I'll spam

56:15.260 --> 56:19.620
amusement all the way okay video game related webcomics spam use but I have

56:19.620 --> 56:24.020
sizzling makes me crack up like crazy all right anyway that's it that's it

56:24.020 --> 56:26.760
we're definitely done we're talking about webcomics we know we're done nail

56:26.760 --> 56:32.820
coffin bang final thoughts Loki oh well our psp.com visit it it's awesome it's

56:32.820 --> 56:39.820

Let me know when they get Geomancer. Are you going to come back?

56:51.660 --> 56:56.660
