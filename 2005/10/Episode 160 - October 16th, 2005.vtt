WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:17.000
On tonight's program, ladies and gentlemen, we're gonna have a follow-up. We're gonna talk a lot about a follow-up to something we did last week.

00:17.000 --> 00:21.000
Talking about Orange Lounge Radio jumping the shark. For reals, yo.

00:21.000 --> 00:24.000
We didn't jump the shark as much as we landed on it.

00:24.000 --> 00:27.000
You didn't jump the shark as much as I thought you were gonna.

00:27.000 --> 00:36.000
Well Todd, it's going to all make sense tonight. We're going to finally reveal what happened this week, and why you guys are going to really get a kick out of this.

00:36.000 --> 00:39.000
Also on this show, the Ferret comes out of the closet.

00:39.000 --> 00:44.000
Yes, and the Ferret is getting his own show on Logo. Go figure.

00:44.000 --> 00:53.000
Also, I have a secret, and I'm going to tell you my secret. My secret is that I'm gay. No, I'm kidding. We have a real secret.

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
No! I would have never guessed!

00:56.000 --> 01:01.000
All this and more when we come back, so get ready.

01:01.000 --> 01:08.000
Orange Lounge Radio is presented in the TMI Sound Format.

01:31.000 --> 01:59.000
a

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
Come on!

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
Oh God!

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
Heh heh heh heh!

02:04.000 --> 02:08.200
Call me Daddy.

02:08.200 --> 02:12.220
Orange Lounge may contain adult content.

02:12.220 --> 02:16.820
Orange Lounge may contain many four letter words.

02:16.820 --> 02:20.400
Orange Lounge may contain a scene of beauty.

02:20.400 --> 02:23.440
Orange Lounge may contain plenty of-

02:23.440 --> 02:24.440
B-B-B-B-B-B-Cocky?

02:24.440 --> 02:27.040
Just kidding!

02:27.040 --> 02:31.040
And Orange Lounge Radio will not contain any of that in this episode.

02:31.040 --> 02:33.040
Well isn't that special!

02:37.040 --> 02:48.040
Orange Lounge Radio Live is a fully interactive program via our website at www.orangeloungeradio.com

02:48.040 --> 02:56.040
And now, here are your hosts for Orange Lounge Radio Live, Dark Sakura, Sky, and Loki.

02:57.040 --> 03:06.040
We are live, and this is episode number 160 for this October 16, 2005.

03:06.040 --> 03:11.040
You're tuned in to Orange Lounge Radio, radio the gamers really want.

03:11.040 --> 03:14.040
We give you what you want, what you really, really want.

03:14.040 --> 03:18.520
And this is Orange Lounge Radio Live, your home for all the news and discussion on rhythm

03:18.520 --> 03:23.080
and music games, as well as the gamer community and the pop culture world.

03:23.080 --> 03:28.880
We're plugged in and fully interactive through our website at www.orangeloungeradio.com.

03:28.880 --> 03:29.880
My name is Rob Roberts.

03:29.880 --> 03:33.480
You might know me as Sky, or you might know me as That Guy.

03:33.480 --> 03:37.360
Hey, you guys!

03:37.360 --> 03:38.360
Stop distracting me.

03:38.360 --> 03:41.640
Joining me, as always, are my awesome co-hosts.

03:41.640 --> 03:42.640
Sometimes I wish we were a TV show.

03:42.640 --> 03:46.640
Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts. Say hello to Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

03:46.640 --> 03:50.640
I don't know why you're talking about all this live crap, because I feel half-dead.

03:53.640 --> 03:57.640
We're actually reanimated tonight. We're not really alive yet.

03:57.640 --> 04:01.640
In honor of Land of the Dead being released to DVD.

04:01.640 --> 04:06.640
I must have Zombie Movie Fest. And I found my copy of Shaun of the Dead.

04:06.640 --> 04:07.640
So we must all watch this.

04:07.640 --> 04:09.640
Alright. Sounds good.

04:09.640 --> 04:15.640
Also joining us tonight, the one and only, the beautiful Loki.

04:15.640 --> 04:17.640
I'm beautiful today, I guess.

04:17.640 --> 04:19.640
Our sex symbol on the show here.

04:19.640 --> 04:25.640
Wow, that's funny. I thought that was the ferret.

04:25.640 --> 04:30.640
And to celebrate Loki being the sex symbol, he's actually wearing nothing but a bikini tonight.

04:30.640 --> 04:33.640
And the shirt and pants, minus the bikini?

04:33.640 --> 04:38.640
Again, reasons why we need to be a TV show.

04:38.640 --> 04:44.640
So all of you out there can see through the lies. All the lies.

04:47.640 --> 04:52.640
We won't be able to see through the lies because we'll be blinded by your white ass.

04:52.640 --> 04:54.640
My ass is not that white.

04:54.640 --> 04:57.640
I'll take your word for it. What do you tan your ass?

04:57.640 --> 04:59.640
I don't tan my ass.

04:59.640 --> 05:02.640
Are you a dude sunbather?

05:02.640 --> 05:07.640
I don't sunbathe at all. That involves going outside. I don't like outside.

05:07.640 --> 05:14.640
Alright, say hello to our special guest tonight, the one, the only, DDR Angel.

05:14.640 --> 05:15.640
Hello.

05:15.640 --> 05:16.640
How are you?

05:16.640 --> 05:17.640
Good.

05:17.640 --> 05:18.640
How are you today?

05:18.640 --> 05:19.640
Nintendogs.

05:19.640 --> 05:20.640
You're playing Nintendogs?

05:20.640 --> 05:23.640
My Nintendogs, I think, floated to the top of the bowl, finally.

05:23.640 --> 05:24.640
I think, uh...

05:24.640 --> 05:25.640
Hey, I got a Dalmatian.

05:25.640 --> 05:28.640
I named him IKEA.

05:28.640 --> 05:29.640
I know, that was my...

05:29.640 --> 05:30.640
Nice.

05:30.640 --> 05:31.640
No, that wasn't my suggestion.

05:31.640 --> 05:32.640
No, no.

05:32.640 --> 05:33.640
My suggestion was Alpo.

05:33.640 --> 05:34.640
That you name your dog Alpo.

05:34.640 --> 05:36.640
You wouldn't name him Alpo, and he wouldn't respond to Alpo.

05:36.640 --> 05:40.640
So, I named him IKEA after what looked like meatballs all over his body.

05:40.640 --> 05:43.640
It was better than naming him, you know, Smallpox.

05:43.640 --> 05:45.640
Oh.

05:45.640 --> 05:51.640
Also, in the studio, say hello to the one and only newly-shaven, by the way.

05:51.640 --> 05:56.640
That's what threw me off, is that X of her was telling me earlier today that he was never going to shave off his beard.

05:56.640 --> 05:58.640
And he fucking did it!

05:58.640 --> 06:00.640
He fucking did it!

06:00.640 --> 06:02.640
Liar, liar, pants on fire.

06:02.640 --> 06:10.000
I was going to do that little, you know, chin bacon strip thing, you know, is that what

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
that's called?

06:11.000 --> 06:13.520
Yeah, it's called a bacon strip when it's in another place.

06:13.520 --> 06:14.520
Oh, okay.

06:14.520 --> 06:15.520
Well, I call it the chin bacon strip.

06:15.520 --> 06:17.880
I thought that was the Brazilian wax job.

06:17.880 --> 06:19.640
No, Brazilian wax...

06:19.640 --> 06:24.560
I'll have extrovert explain a Brazilian wax job a little later in the show.

06:24.560 --> 06:25.560
Brazilian wax job.

06:25.560 --> 06:27.440
Maybe we should leave that to Mr. Spanky.

06:27.440 --> 06:28.720
God, it's going to be one of those nights.

06:28.720 --> 06:30.880
Why don't you look that up on Wikipedia?

06:30.880 --> 06:32.880
See if we can...

06:32.880 --> 06:34.880
Okay, I'll do that right now.

06:34.880 --> 06:41.880
See if Brazilian wax jobs over on Wikipedia and you can explain that to all the kids exactly what that's all about.

06:42.880 --> 06:46.880
Yeah, I just decided to shave it all off.

06:47.880 --> 06:50.880
Did you shave it all off?

06:50.880 --> 06:52.880
I'm totally bald.

06:52.880 --> 06:54.880
I'm kidding.

06:54.880 --> 07:06.880
Okay. Yeah, anyway. Tonight's show should be okay. Tonight's gonna be an okay show. Don't get your hopes up. No, I'm kidding. We're gonna have a good time.

07:06.880 --> 07:07.880
I saw Serenity again.

07:07.880 --> 07:22.880
We're gonna talk about How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day. We're gonna talk about Orange on the Radio, Almost Jumping the Shark. We're gonna talk about My Little Surprise. We're gonna talk about a lot of stuff tonight. And maybe we'll play a game. We haven't played a game on the show in a while, so I think we need to do some Bimani match games.

07:22.880 --> 07:23.880
Can we also talk about Opening the Door?

07:23.880 --> 07:29.720
opening the door. Brazilian Waxing is on the Wikipedia. Is it? Okay. And I'm going to listen

07:29.720 --> 07:32.560
to the chatroom. Darkstalker is going to research Brazilian Waxing and then talk to you all

07:32.560 --> 07:35.400
about it soon. And Expert is going to open the damn door so we can get some air in here.

07:35.400 --> 07:42.640
Thank you. Alright. We will be back after this. In this break I have queued up some

07:42.640 --> 07:47.120
old school music. So it's just a potpourri of stuff. But it's old. Like all this shit

07:47.120 --> 07:51.280
is like three years old. So we're going to hear some old shit. And stuff we don't play

07:51.280 --> 07:54.280
Well, our listeners are used to that. They've been paying attention to us for three years.

07:54.280 --> 07:56.280
Exactly. Three and a half.

07:56.280 --> 08:02.280
Three and a half years. We're like toddlers. We're potty trained now. We're learning how to read.

08:02.280 --> 08:07.280
Okay, suck, Reena. You know this wouldn't be the show if we didn't at least have five sexual references during the show.

08:07.280 --> 08:09.280
Remember, adult.

08:09.280 --> 08:18.280
Ron Chen says, Orange Lounge Radio, more sex, less bimani. Hey, in a perfect world, we would be about sex and bimani.

08:18.280 --> 08:25.280
me. Yeah, anyway, we'll be back after this with Orange Launch Radio where we'll talk

08:25.280 --> 08:32.280
video where we'll talk about a lot of SEX and some games.

08:55.280 --> 08:57.280
Oh

09:55.280 --> 10:00.280
a

10:00.280 --> 10:05.280
a

10:05.280 --> 10:10.280
a

10:10.280 --> 10:15.280
a

10:15.280 --> 10:20.280
a

13:20.280 --> 13:22.280
You

14:20.280 --> 14:22.280
Come on, come on, come on!

14:27.280 --> 14:29.280
Come on!

14:29.280 --> 14:57.940
The

14:57.940 --> 15:02.940
Hello? Hello, is this thing on? Testing? Testing 1-2?

15:02.940 --> 15:06.940
I'm looking in the index, but I don't see anything for how to run a radio show.

15:06.940 --> 15:10.940
Hello? I don't understand this. This thing works.

15:10.940 --> 15:12.940
This thing reads like stereo instructions.

15:12.940 --> 15:13.940
Is this on?

15:13.940 --> 15:14.940
What the hell?

15:16.940 --> 15:20.940
Orange Lounge Radio. Rope down. Get open body radio.

15:20.940 --> 15:21.940
What the f***?

15:21.940 --> 15:29.240
We are back, and Bob had to run to the bathroom with explosive diarrhea from the burrito he

15:29.240 --> 15:31.380
ate a moment ago.

15:31.380 --> 15:36.720
It really stinks, so he had the vent on and everything, but, um, I decided to go ahead

15:36.720 --> 15:42.940
and fill the gap I would call our resident expert on all things that are very TMI, Mr.

15:42.940 --> 15:43.940
Spanky!

15:43.940 --> 15:50.940
Oh, do it all night, do it with me, I'll take you to the house, and make you feel free,

15:50.940 --> 15:59.900
hello everybody oh my god it's been forever since I've been on this show

15:59.900 --> 16:05.340
what's wrong with you people I thought you didn't love me hello everybody it's

16:05.340 --> 16:11.580
mr. spanky it's your favorite DDR dancer from DDR PC

16:11.580 --> 16:18.660
does anybody play DDR PC anymore I'm using it to hold up via the table

16:18.660 --> 16:24.080
everybody forgot about me that's okay that's okay that you people forget about

16:24.080 --> 16:28.840
mr. spanky because it gives me a lot of time to learn about sex and as I

16:28.840 --> 16:33.400
understand it the kids today want to learn about Brazilian waxing I'm gonna

16:33.400 --> 16:38.840
talk a little bit about Brazilian waxing to the kids today except okay if you're

16:38.840 --> 16:41.920
like really a kid you don't want to listen cuz you're more than day I might

16:41.920 --> 16:46.140
get upset with you for listening and anyway Brazilian waxing has to do with

16:46.140 --> 16:50.300
your pubic hair. And if you're a kid, you don't have pubic hair. So this doesn't matter

16:50.300 --> 16:59.300
to you. However, Dr. Sackler, I know you want to know about this stuff. So pay attention.

16:59.300 --> 17:04.580
Okay, so I'm going to tell you guys about Brazilian waxing. Basically what it is, in

17:04.580 --> 17:10.300
a Brazilian wax, it's a waxing of your pubic area. And it means you completely remove the

17:10.300 --> 17:17.300
hair around your vulva. Okay, but you only have a vulva if you're a woman. If you're

17:17.380 --> 17:22.700
a guy, it takes away all the hair around your penis. Okay? Not only that though, it's not

17:22.700 --> 17:28.080
just like a pubic waxing job. A Brazilian wax means they wax your ass too. So they take

17:28.080 --> 17:33.860
away all the hair around your anus. So in order for them to do this, they have to coat

17:33.860 --> 17:38.780
you in hot wax. So they have to coat you in hot wax around your penis and your anus or

17:38.780 --> 17:41.900
Or your boba if you're a girl.

17:41.900 --> 17:45.120
So this means you have to get naked with whoever is doing it but you know some people like

17:45.120 --> 17:47.060
to get naked so it's okay.

17:47.060 --> 17:49.760
And so they're going to rip away all that wax and they're going to leave you with a

17:49.760 --> 17:53.420
really clean butt and penis and vagina.

17:53.420 --> 17:58.420
Well hopefully you don't have all three.

17:58.420 --> 18:05.860
So anyway this is related to a type of sexual activity called acomoclictic which means you

18:05.860 --> 18:11.140
have a preference for hairless genitals, and I happen to know for a fact, except for who

18:11.140 --> 18:16.340
I ran into at the sex club the other night, has this preference for hairless genitals,

18:16.340 --> 18:22.380
don't you? That was you? Yes, that was me, with the gag, and the ball. I was wondering

18:22.380 --> 18:29.060
who that hairless anus belonged to, and now that I know it was you, I am so thrilled.

18:29.060 --> 18:33.760
Okay. Well, I'm gonna go now, kids, so you can talk about the DDR, but I hope you learned

18:33.760 --> 18:40.120
a good lesson today. So remember, check it out, DDRPC, Mr. Spanky, one of the downloadable

18:40.120 --> 18:45.120
characters, only $5 in the bargain bin at Freud's. Bye, everybody!

18:45.120 --> 18:49.120
Bye, Mr. Spanky! Rob, get out of the bathroom!

18:49.120 --> 18:58.120
Oh, do it all night, do it with me, I'll take you to heaven if you make me feel free.

18:58.120 --> 19:01.120
Make sure to spray some Febreze in there or something.

19:01.120 --> 19:02.120
I'm back.

19:02.120 --> 19:03.120
You better?

19:03.120 --> 19:04.120
Yeah, I'm a little better.

19:04.120 --> 19:06.120
You didn't tell anybody why I was gone, did you?

19:06.120 --> 19:07.120
No.

19:07.120 --> 19:08.120
Oh, okay.

19:08.120 --> 19:09.120
Good.

19:09.120 --> 19:10.120
All right.

19:10.120 --> 19:13.120
Anyway, it says we were talking about jumping the shark.

19:13.120 --> 19:16.120
Oh, yeah, yeah, we were going to talk about jumping the shark.

19:16.120 --> 19:18.120
Well, let's get to first a little bit of How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day.

19:18.120 --> 19:20.120
It's how we always like to start the show off.

19:20.120 --> 19:23.120
I mean, we would never start the show any other way with things that are completely

19:23.120 --> 19:25.120
random or rude or completely off base or anything.

19:25.120 --> 19:26.120
Never.

19:26.120 --> 19:27.120
No, never.

19:27.120 --> 19:28.120
Dark Sakura.

19:28.120 --> 19:32.120
You know, for any game companies that might be listening tonight.

19:32.120 --> 19:36.120
Hahahaha.

19:36.120 --> 19:40.120
DarkSakura, how was your week? How was your day?

19:40.120 --> 19:44.120
My week was fabulous, in a really busy, crappy way.

19:44.120 --> 19:48.120
Um, I played a new game that I'm not going to talk about right now.

19:48.120 --> 19:52.120
And, uh, Dan got me the Lawyer game for DS.

19:52.120 --> 19:56.120
I don't remember what it's called.

19:56.120 --> 19:57.120
The Black Gate?

19:57.120 --> 19:58.120
Phoenix Wright.

19:58.120 --> 20:00.240
Phoenix Wright, Attorney at Law.

20:00.240 --> 20:01.580
And he's been playing it!

20:01.580 --> 20:03.600
I want to see this, it sounds cool.

20:03.600 --> 20:08.920
And apparently it's been, like, you do murder cases and shit like that.

20:08.920 --> 20:13.960
And then, uh, I played, I tried to play Katamari and it was like, ooh, it's Star Wars!

20:13.960 --> 20:17.960
So, cause he bought, like, all the rest of the Star Wars, not Star Wars, Star Trek movies.

20:17.960 --> 20:19.840
So he's been, like, uber Trekkie mode.

20:19.840 --> 20:22.440
I finished season one of Stargate!

20:22.440 --> 20:24.000
Ooh!

20:24.000 --> 20:28.240
And then self serenity again, because I'm a big nerd.

20:28.240 --> 20:29.720
That you are, no disputing that.

20:29.720 --> 20:32.360
We had the Katrina relief sale on Friday night.

20:32.360 --> 20:33.360
Yes we did.

20:33.360 --> 20:40.640
So a whole bunch of stuff, and we've managed to pull in $130 for the charity, so we are

20:40.640 --> 20:45.560
going to be delivering that, and all the leftovers are going to be going to the Salvation Army.

20:45.560 --> 20:53.640
I also am going to be acquiring more things for giveaways on the show.

20:53.640 --> 20:54.640
Very cool.

20:54.640 --> 20:55.640
We like giveaways.

20:55.640 --> 20:58.640
We're giving away two PSP games on tonight's podcast.

20:58.640 --> 20:59.640
Fabulous.

20:59.640 --> 21:08.600
I also started my Dreamweaver class, which is, I'll put it this way, how bored I was.

21:08.600 --> 21:11.800
She made us stay in there for the whole two hour orientation so that she could show people

21:11.800 --> 21:13.720
how to change font.

21:13.720 --> 21:19.220
By the time the first person was done changing their background color, I had the assignment

21:19.220 --> 21:21.880
that she wanted us to do done, uploaded ready.

21:21.880 --> 21:23.440
I changed the text sizes.

21:23.440 --> 21:26.080
I changed the fonts, I changed the background color,

21:26.080 --> 21:31.160
I added in line breaks and the bar thing.

21:31.160 --> 21:33.680
And then I even put a picture on it.

21:33.680 --> 21:35.400
So I'll be linking that in the chat room,

21:35.400 --> 21:36.300
what I did in my class.

21:36.300 --> 21:37.880
I saw your web page.

21:37.880 --> 21:42.080
And I did this in like 15 minutes.

21:42.080 --> 21:43.960
That's actually with two revisions.

21:43.960 --> 21:45.840
And after going back and adding in the stuff

21:45.840 --> 21:47.700
that she wanted us to do in class.

21:47.700 --> 21:52.160
And the TA came up and said, have you used this before?

21:52.160 --> 21:53.720
I said, yeah, Dreamweaver 4.

21:53.720 --> 21:55.520
She's like, that's the one I started with.

21:55.520 --> 21:58.160
You're going to love this class.

21:58.160 --> 22:00.240
So I've already made my impressions.

22:00.240 --> 22:00.740
Good.

22:00.740 --> 22:01.240
Good deal.

22:01.240 --> 22:02.680
And I dropped a class.

22:02.680 --> 22:04.600
What'd you drop?

22:04.600 --> 22:06.600
Technical communication and plain English.

22:06.600 --> 22:09.760
Awesome teacher, but four classes,

22:09.760 --> 22:12.520
working full time, the show, and going to the gym,

22:12.520 --> 22:14.440
ain't going to happen.

22:14.440 --> 22:17.160
So I went to the gym twice this week.

22:17.160 --> 22:18.100
Be proud of me.

22:18.100 --> 22:18.600
Good job.

22:18.600 --> 22:19.760
That's more times than I went to the gym.

22:19.760 --> 22:20.120
I went to the gym real time.

22:20.120 --> 22:21.120
And then I ate ice cream all day,

22:21.120 --> 22:23.160
Because Baskin-Robbins has pumpkin ice cream,

22:23.160 --> 22:24.680
and everyone should go have some.

22:24.680 --> 22:25.720
I want to go have some.

22:25.720 --> 22:28.360
I just might.

22:28.360 --> 22:30.320
And that's it.

22:30.320 --> 22:32.320
Loki, how was your week?

22:32.320 --> 22:34.400
My week was OK.

22:34.400 --> 22:38.840
Thursday, we left the Tahoe for our company's 25th anniversary.

22:38.840 --> 22:39.920
So that was kind of cool.

22:39.920 --> 22:42.400
We got a bunch of DVDs and stuff that I'll

22:42.400 --> 22:44.480
be turning in for more games.

22:44.480 --> 22:47.320
Then, was it last night?

22:47.320 --> 22:53.960
We actually had a party for our 25th anniversary, and they had the coolest thing ever.

22:53.960 --> 23:01.000
They got the guy from that show, That's My Bush, to do this long ass, like, just speech

23:01.000 --> 23:02.720
on video, and it's hilarious.

23:02.720 --> 23:09.600
I mean, this guy is spot on for President Bush, so it was really cool, just really awesome,

23:09.600 --> 23:11.560
and I drank lots of alcohol that was free.

23:11.560 --> 23:14.200
So that was also cool.

23:14.200 --> 23:21.900
The other thing I did this week was basically just, I don't know, try to play some more

23:21.900 --> 23:22.900
new games.

23:22.900 --> 23:32.420
I got SSX on tour, that was pretty cool, and I don't know, just same old stuff, work stuff,

23:32.420 --> 23:38.180
and lots of driving, fucking hate driving, and worked on the PSP web page.

23:38.180 --> 23:39.580
Lots of fun.

23:39.580 --> 23:41.220
O-L-R-P-S-P dot com.

23:41.220 --> 23:42.220
Yes.

23:42.220 --> 23:43.220
It's sexy.

23:43.220 --> 23:47.020
Check it out. It's gonna be even sexier soon. Ooh, good to hear.

23:47.020 --> 23:51.020
Oh shit, I forgot that I linked this week. I talked to my main name.

23:51.020 --> 23:52.220
Oh, what? You just linked it?

23:52.220 --> 23:54.220
Um, I made a boo-boo.

23:54.220 --> 23:56.220
Oh, well. Who cares?

23:56.220 --> 23:58.220
Yeah, maybe the chatroom will notice what it is.

23:58.220 --> 24:01.220
Yeah, right. Who will? Oh well.

24:01.220 --> 24:02.220
Uh, is that it?

24:02.220 --> 24:05.220
That'd be it. That's all I can think of that was interesting.

24:05.220 --> 24:07.220
Okay, sounds good.

24:07.220 --> 24:09.220
Uh, Xtaphar, how was your week? How was your day?

24:09.220 --> 24:18.100
it went well I mean it was boring really didn't do really anything worked saw the

24:18.100 --> 24:25.340
family yesterday you know did my shaven thing today you know but not the

24:25.340 --> 24:29.100
Brazilian way no I didn't I didn't do the Brazilian why I can't shave my

24:29.100 --> 24:35.740
genitals I mean if I shave my genitals I mean I break out so it it doesn't look

24:35.740 --> 24:40.740
very pleasing to the eye. It looks like herpes? It doesn't look like herpes. That's the purpose

24:40.740 --> 24:46.300
of waxing, you don't shave. Well waxing I'm pretty sure would make me break out too. Maybe

24:46.300 --> 24:52.440
I just have really sensitive skin around the area. I think we all have sensitive skin around

24:52.440 --> 25:05.840
the area yeah especially the penis and you know let's say the balls so that's

25:05.840 --> 25:11.720
that's that one episode of Beavis and Butthead where the gym teachers like

25:11.720 --> 25:17.160
today we're going to talk about the penis forget it

25:17.160 --> 25:21.160
Whoo! How was your week? How was your day, Angel?

25:21.160 --> 25:24.400
My computer exploded on Friday.

25:24.400 --> 25:28.560
It, like, literally blew up in a giant hall of flames? I don't know. The power supply went

25:28.560 --> 25:32.320
poof, so... Angel doesn't have a computer

25:32.320 --> 25:35.560
for a while, unless

25:35.560 --> 25:38.680
I can, like, fix it tonight. I've been having

25:38.680 --> 25:43.480
trouble with it for the last couple days. It's been doing some weird stuff that I...

25:43.480 --> 25:46.560
So what exactly does the power supply do when it explodes?

25:46.560 --> 25:49.560
It stinks really bad.

25:52.560 --> 25:54.560
Shut up, Exeter.

25:55.560 --> 25:58.560
Comments that nobody could hear except for me.

25:58.560 --> 26:00.560
Yeah, that's fine.

26:00.560 --> 26:04.560
And we went to a party yesterday, but that's okay.

26:04.560 --> 26:10.560
And it was fun and it was good to see people and stuff like that.

26:10.560 --> 26:13.560
And yeah, I guess that's it.

26:13.560 --> 26:19.560
Um, I've been working, uh, in school and stuff like that.

26:19.560 --> 26:27.560
Uh, that's it. Oh, and I found my Final Fantasy XI discs, so you know what I'm gonna be doing this week if I can get the computer running.

26:27.560 --> 26:28.560
Addict!

26:28.560 --> 26:31.560
Hey! I've also been playing World of Warcraft.

26:31.560 --> 26:33.560
You need to be playing World of Warcraft with me, thank you.

26:33.560 --> 26:35.560
Yeah, I have that. I've been playing that for-

26:35.560 --> 26:37.560
What stuff are you on?

26:37.560 --> 26:40.560
Right now, I'm playing on Maelstrom, but, um, I also have-

26:40.560 --> 26:42.560
I'm playing on Scarlet Crusade.

26:42.560 --> 26:47.560
Yeah, I have one on Scarlet Crusade that I haven't logged into for a week because of...

26:47.560 --> 26:49.560
I'm only level 7, so it's all cool.

26:49.560 --> 26:52.560
Yeah. I'll wait for you to catch up to me then.

26:52.560 --> 26:55.560
I'm like 32 on that server.

26:55.560 --> 26:58.560
Anyway, yeah, that's it for me I guess. Bye.

26:58.560 --> 26:59.560
Okay, bye.

26:59.560 --> 27:00.560
Until later.

27:00.560 --> 27:07.560
Okay. Let's see, what did I do this week? Really, not a whole lot.

27:07.560 --> 27:09.560
I worked my ass off, that's what I did.

27:09.560 --> 27:22.560
And I haven't had time for a whole lot of games. I've just been playing Castlevania DS a lot, which I'm making very slow progress on, and I've been playing a little bit of Final Fantasy XI.

27:22.560 --> 27:30.560
Not a lot, though. I haven't gained a level or anything. Final Fantasy XI is kind of annoying me, but I'll talk about that later.

27:30.560 --> 27:34.560
Final Fantasy XI is getting very annoying, so we'll talk about that later.

27:34.560 --> 27:46.560
Um, and, um, I think that's really about it. I mean, God, I went to Target, like, twice this weekend, which is pretty cool, because I love Target. Is Target not the greatest store, ever?

27:46.560 --> 27:48.560
Um, I, it's not.

27:48.560 --> 27:49.560
People Walmart.

27:49.560 --> 27:50.560
I don't, see, I don't like Walmart.

27:50.560 --> 27:51.560
Oh my God.

27:51.560 --> 27:52.560
I don't like going into Walmart.

27:52.560 --> 28:03.560
Thinking about Walmart, like, I went to my hometown this weekend, and, like, they're building the biggest-ass Walmart there. There's, like, four entrances in the front. It's going to be a super center.

28:03.560 --> 28:05.560
And we're getting one around the corner from my house.

28:05.560 --> 28:06.560
Really?

28:06.560 --> 28:10.560
Super Walmart is the best if you're poor and need groceries, because you get real groceries, but they're half the price.

28:10.560 --> 28:12.560
I want Super Target.

28:12.560 --> 28:15.560
There's a Super Target in the place that I grew up as well.

28:15.560 --> 28:17.560
But you can't get cheap groceries.

28:17.560 --> 28:19.560
They don't have a full grocery store in them.

28:19.560 --> 28:25.560
And not at Target Greatland, but there's also Super Target. It might have a different name, but there's three levels of Target.

28:25.560 --> 28:27.560
There's regular Target, Greatland, and then Mondo Target.

28:27.560 --> 28:28.560
Uber Target!

28:28.560 --> 28:30.560
Uber Target, like really big Target.

28:30.560 --> 28:33.560
We just need the Orange Lodge Grocery Store.

28:33.560 --> 28:36.560
Has a little, you know, video games section.

28:36.560 --> 28:41.560
You know, my dream grocery store would be just like that old TV show, Shop Till You Drop.

28:41.560 --> 28:42.560
That's still on.

28:42.560 --> 28:43.560
Is that still on?

28:43.560 --> 28:44.560
Yeah.

28:44.560 --> 28:45.560
No, what?

28:45.560 --> 28:46.560
No, wait, Shop Till You Drop.

28:46.560 --> 28:48.560
Is it the old-ass reruns from like the early, late 80s?

28:48.560 --> 28:50.560
No, no, they still have, it was the one that was on Lifetime, right?

28:50.560 --> 28:51.560
Yeah.

28:51.560 --> 28:52.560
Yeah, they still have that.

28:52.560 --> 28:55.560
It's like on, I think it's on PAX TV.

28:55.560 --> 28:56.560
Lifetime television for women.

28:56.560 --> 28:59.560
Yeah, now it's on Lifetime television for Christians.

28:59.560 --> 29:04.880
Christians, um, you know, PAX TV. Oh, PAX TV. Yeah, but, um, no, it's, it's, uh, it's

29:04.880 --> 29:09.120
still on there, I believe. Supermarket Sweep, that's what it's called. Supermarket Sweep

29:09.120 --> 29:13.440
is rad, okay? Oh, why was I thinking Shop To You Drop? That must have been another show.

29:13.440 --> 29:16.840
There was, oh, I think that was one that was where they go. Oh, it was the mall. There's

29:16.840 --> 29:20.380
the mall one, yeah, they don't have that one anymore. I didn't mean that one, I meant Supermarket

29:20.380 --> 29:25.640
Sweep. That's what I meant. Okay, yeah, they still have that. Supermarket Sweep is badass.

29:25.640 --> 29:29.420
You'd like throw in those canned hams into this cart?

29:29.420 --> 29:30.800
It was pretty badass.

29:30.800 --> 29:32.900
But they never ever won.

29:32.900 --> 29:35.640
They never ever found all of the things that they needed.

29:35.640 --> 29:37.040
They totally won on that show.

29:37.040 --> 29:38.040
I've seen it.

29:38.040 --> 29:41.000
Like, I didn't.

29:41.000 --> 29:43.760
I've seen winners.

29:43.760 --> 29:44.760
I've seen winners.

29:44.760 --> 29:46.720
I can't believe I got those two shows confused.

29:46.720 --> 29:48.040
Weren't they on in like the same hour?

29:48.040 --> 29:50.320
Like it was like the shopping hour on Lifetime?

29:50.320 --> 29:52.320
Yeah, I believe it was.

29:52.320 --> 29:53.320
Okay.

29:53.320 --> 29:56.120
I figured it out.

29:56.120 --> 29:58.560
The chat room is correcting me because we're like,

29:58.560 --> 30:01.200
there's like a minute of lag between the chat and us.

30:01.200 --> 30:02.840
It's just always kind of funny because everybody's yelling,

30:02.840 --> 30:05.400
it's supermarket sweep, not chat till you drop.

30:05.400 --> 30:08.200
Our chat room, by the way, www.orangeontrader.com.

30:08.200 --> 30:11.120
Click on chat if you want to chat away with us.

30:11.120 --> 30:13.720
All right.

30:13.720 --> 30:18.640
Let's start off tonight by talking about a little bit

30:18.640 --> 30:20.320
of follow up from last week.

30:20.320 --> 30:21.200
Bleached assholes?

30:21.200 --> 30:23.000
No, not that.

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
No, no, no. I think we should talk about bleach circles.

30:25.000 --> 30:28.000
No, I'm done with the sex talk for tonight. Jesus.

30:28.000 --> 30:29.000
I'm not.

30:29.000 --> 30:32.000
I know you're never done with the sex talk. That's your problem.

30:32.000 --> 30:37.000
All right. Let's talk about what happened this week with Orange Launch Radio.

30:37.000 --> 30:41.000
Jamie, do you want to kind of set this story up? What happened?

30:41.000 --> 30:42.000
Is this about Thursday?

30:42.000 --> 30:43.000
Yes.

30:43.000 --> 30:48.000
Okay. Last week, I got an email. Well, technically the week before.

30:48.000 --> 30:49.000
before.

30:49.000 --> 30:54.840
I get an email from our friends at KCRA, the local news station, the ones who had interviewed

30:54.840 --> 30:56.440
us before about podcasting.

30:56.440 --> 30:58.800
You might remember the KCRA interview as very famous.

30:58.800 --> 30:59.800
It was so much fun.

30:59.800 --> 31:03.080
Oh, it's so much fun.

31:03.080 --> 31:13.480
So I get an email from their project manager who wants us to work for a story play testing

31:13.480 --> 31:17.960
a game brought to us by Red Octane.

31:17.960 --> 31:21.960
Now instantly we're like, is this in the groove?

31:21.960 --> 31:23.960
No, it wasn't.

31:23.960 --> 31:29.960
But admittedly, until Thursday, I was operating on the assumption that yes, it was going to be in the groove and another game.

31:29.960 --> 31:32.960
So that's why I was commenting last week that you guys are going to get a big kick out of this,

31:32.960 --> 31:38.960
because we're going to be talking about in the groove on TV and getting our honest, unedited opinion on the game.

31:38.960 --> 31:42.960
But no, instead it's another game.

31:42.960 --> 31:50.000
On Thursday, in my living room, which everyone can now see the awesomeness of my red couches,

31:50.000 --> 31:52.840
we played Guitar Hero.

31:52.840 --> 31:55.800
And that game is awesome.

31:55.800 --> 31:59.720
So I didn't get to do this because of a scheduling conflict, meaning my boss wouldn't give me

31:59.720 --> 32:02.560
the day off work.

32:02.560 --> 32:04.560
You guys got to go play Guitar Hero.

32:04.560 --> 32:07.280
So you and Loki are going to be in a segment.

32:07.280 --> 32:08.280
When's this going to air?

32:08.280 --> 32:09.280
Do we know?

32:09.280 --> 32:10.280
In a couple weeks.

32:10.280 --> 32:14.280
on the confirmation email from... I actually would work with another project manager.

32:14.280 --> 32:17.280
Okay, cool. So we'll actually post this on the site, obviously, when it's ready.

32:17.280 --> 32:19.280
We'll let you guys know about this.

32:19.280 --> 32:23.280
So what's the deal? What happened with Guitar Hero? What's it like? Tell us all about it.

32:23.280 --> 32:28.280
Well, first of all, everyone needs a picture in their head what the...

32:28.280 --> 32:33.280
and I'm going to use the easiest comparison, the controller.

32:33.280 --> 32:35.280
Imagine the Guitar Freaks controller.

32:35.280 --> 32:43.280
Now, imagine the body style license from Gibson, as in a real guitar shape, five buttons, and

32:43.280 --> 32:45.280
a whammy bar.

32:45.280 --> 32:47.200
So yeah, it's pretty awesome.

32:47.200 --> 32:50.760
And the way that you move your hands like, it has an interface, because the game is put

32:50.760 --> 32:53.080
up by harmonics.

32:53.080 --> 32:58.880
The people who gave us res, not res, frequency and amplitude, why'd I say res, but it has

32:58.880 --> 33:04.480
a very similar interface where the keys are coming toward you, but on your easiest difficulty

33:04.480 --> 33:09.320
you have three, then it goes to four on medium, then it's five and up for the harder difficulties.

33:09.320 --> 33:15.400
If I remember correctly, I think it's three for easy, um, medium is three with the occasional

33:15.400 --> 33:23.240
fourth. Well, it goes up to four for medium, that's just what I just said. Anyway, um,

33:23.240 --> 33:27.360
but the way that you're moving your hands on it as you play it has a very, very real

33:27.360 --> 33:33.600
guitar feel to it you're they even go so far as to what they call it fret buttons

33:33.600 --> 33:39.120
your the little switch for you know where your strings would be is actually

33:39.120 --> 33:42.360
called the strum bar and you have your whammy bar it's built with micro

33:42.360 --> 33:46.600
switches in it so you can actually hold them you have a notes that you hold like

33:46.600 --> 33:50.520
you're really strumming them it's really pretty cool you build up your meter by

33:50.520 --> 33:57.160
by wailing hard songs I played in it I played I want to be sedated I played

33:57.160 --> 34:02.160
twenty, twenty, twenty-four hours ago. I want to be the baby.

34:02.160 --> 34:03.160
That sounds awesome.

34:03.160 --> 34:05.160
And I played More Than a Feeling, which was Boston.

34:05.160 --> 34:06.160
Oh.

34:06.160 --> 34:12.160
That's on one of the, they have them grouped as like groups of five songs in each difficulty class.

34:12.160 --> 34:13.160
Oh.

34:13.160 --> 34:17.160
And then as you play, but you can actually do each song on it at different difficulties too.

34:17.160 --> 34:23.160
So you will basically judge, you can work up through the list on easy and then work up through the list on medium

34:23.160 --> 34:25.160
and actually get your challenge out of it that way.

34:25.160 --> 34:27.920
weird setup. So it's not like a giant song wheel like we're used to in the

34:27.920 --> 34:36.080
Beaumont games? No. In this game, if Guitar Freaks were a 10, this game would blow that

34:36.080 --> 34:39.400
scale apart and put it up, you know, it would be a hundred on a scale of one to

34:39.400 --> 34:44.080
ten, I think. Wow. It's really awesome. Now, is it set up like frequency and amplitude

34:44.080 --> 34:46.840
then? Because that's how, okay, that's how like frequency and amplitude are. It's like

34:46.840 --> 34:49.920
groups of five and then you play through it and then there's like the bonus song

34:49.920 --> 34:53.640
you might unlock at the end. The bonus songs are actually, are all originals,

34:53.640 --> 34:57.680
original songs. So this sounds to me like it's pretty much

34:57.680 --> 35:01.160
frequency and amplitude we finally get our sequel except now it's a guitar

35:01.160 --> 35:05.600
game. And they are actually only going to be sold with the guitar with a

35:05.600 --> 35:08.600
price of retail $69.99

35:08.600 --> 35:12.320
but the guitar controller is the best controller

35:12.320 --> 35:15.520
of any type of non-traditional peripheral I have ever

35:15.520 --> 35:19.340
ever seen. It actually has substance and weight to it, not like heavy heavy

35:19.340 --> 35:22.640
but it definitely feels more substantial than the guitar freaks controllers honestly

35:22.640 --> 35:27.640
The song list was fabulous. I mean, it was just really awesome stuff.

35:27.640 --> 35:31.640
Were there actual songs in it, or was it mostly karaoke-style covers?

35:31.640 --> 35:33.640
They were remakes, however, they were done...

35:33.640 --> 35:37.640
They even went so far as to recreate vocal effects.

35:37.640 --> 35:44.640
Just hearing about a lot of the steps they went through to make it as authentic as possible,

35:44.640 --> 35:47.640
as close to the original as possible, just completely...

35:47.640 --> 35:50.640
It was really, really awesome.

35:50.640 --> 35:54.960
Now, Harmonix obviously had a huge part to do with this game, so it really does sound

35:54.960 --> 35:55.960
like...

35:55.960 --> 36:00.260
Because Harmonix obviously also had a big hand in Karaoke Revolution, and the remakes

36:00.260 --> 36:03.500
or whatever they did for Karaoke Revolution were not bad.

36:03.500 --> 36:04.500
They weren't bad.

36:04.500 --> 36:07.480
I mean, obviously not the original, but they're not bad, all things considered.

36:07.480 --> 36:09.160
I've heard much worse remakes.

36:09.160 --> 36:13.720
So kind of that same level of quality going into Guitar Hero, then.

36:13.720 --> 36:14.720
Pretty much.

36:14.720 --> 36:20.060
I mean, it's like they spared no expense, wasted, you know, nothing.

36:20.060 --> 36:25.740
that could have gone into the game to make it feel like the experience of being on stage

36:25.740 --> 36:29.660
and playing in guitar, they've gone out of their way to do. On top of that, you actually

36:29.660 --> 36:34.980
in your career mode, you have a selectable character list. One of the characters was

36:34.980 --> 36:38.820
based off of Keith Richards, but when I first saw this character, me being the Gorillaz

36:38.820 --> 36:44.900
fan I am, he was playing a Flying V. I was like, did they put Murdock in this game? Because

36:44.900 --> 36:49.420
I was like, excuse me, but no, it was actually based off of Keith Richards directly, so I

36:49.420 --> 36:55.460
thought was funny. I had a nerd moment. That's cool. Um, but, it was, there's mega death

36:55.460 --> 36:59.540
in that game. Symphony of Destruction is in that game. What were some of the other songs

36:59.540 --> 37:05.340
you guys can remember? This is Stevie Ray Vaughan, um, who else do you remember? What

37:05.340 --> 37:11.020
did you play? I played Smoke on the Water. Okay. Cause that was awesome. I also played

37:11.020 --> 37:16.660
Iron Man. And, uh, I think it was like Turn It Up or whatever. Where that stupid song

37:16.660 --> 37:18.660
What song is that? It's in the PSP commercial.

37:18.660 --> 37:19.660
Franz Ferdinand song.

37:19.660 --> 37:22.660
Yeah, Franz Ferdinand. I played that.

37:22.660 --> 37:29.660
I checked out some of the unlocked songs because there is apparently a way to key press to unlock all the songs because we watched them do it.

37:29.660 --> 37:30.660
Yep.

37:30.660 --> 37:38.660
So, yeah. Anyways, they had some of the original songs like Guitar Hero, of course, was one that they came up with.

37:38.660 --> 37:42.660
And then I was looking for, apparently there's a freeze-pop song in there, but I didn't see it.

37:42.660 --> 37:44.660
Well, of course, there's got to be a freeze-pop song.

37:44.660 --> 37:46.660
What's the first thing that is a Ziggy Stardust?

37:46.660 --> 37:47.660
Oh, cool.

37:47.660 --> 37:50.660
That's cool.

37:50.660 --> 37:51.660
Sorry.

37:51.660 --> 37:55.660
Yeah, the controller, it's just like a normal controller.

37:55.660 --> 37:57.660
Buttons are sticking.

37:57.660 --> 38:02.660
I had a little bit of button sticking problem, but it wasn't bad.

38:02.660 --> 38:06.660
It was really, you know, it's just like up stuck, fixed, done.

38:06.660 --> 38:07.660
Who cares?

38:07.660 --> 38:09.660
It's pretty cool, though.

38:09.660 --> 38:10.660
Really easy to get into.

38:10.660 --> 38:18.660
The whammy bar thing though kind of throws you off when you're trying to do that because you're supposed to hold the note down for so long and then do a whammy bar thing and it's like, it takes a while to get used to it.

38:18.660 --> 38:28.660
But, um, looks pretty good. Um, I can see the potential for some lawsuits. The game is a little similar to other games, but, um...

38:28.660 --> 38:50.660
The differences I think are substantial enough that they can't, the controller is so completely, you can't do a guitar controller without having it be similar. However, after a little bit of interviewing, the controllers are actually completely built from the ground up. The Switch is built on a different mechanism than the Guitar Freaks controller.

38:50.660 --> 38:58.660
I'm talking about Guitar Freaks. I'm talking about another game. I'm saying this game's too much like Karaoke Revolution. The interface and everything's too similar.

38:58.660 --> 39:01.660
But Harmonix co-made it, so who cares?

39:01.660 --> 39:02.660
Oh, I get it, that's fine then.

39:02.660 --> 39:08.660
They own the patent, so. And on top of that, it doesn't flow side to side, it flows forward.

39:08.660 --> 39:10.660
Eh, whatever. It's an okay game.

39:10.660 --> 39:17.660
Harmonix developed and Konami published Karaoke Revolution, and this time Red Octane is publishing Guitar Hero.

39:17.660 --> 39:37.660
It's a step in the right direction for Octane actually getting real companies to develop games for them, so I think that's great, but I don't know. It's good. I'm looking forward to it since we're not going to get Guitar Freaks until at least next fall. At least, probably never, but yeah, at least.

39:37.660 --> 39:41.660
This game is going to completely blow Guitar Freaks out of the water. I'm sorry.

39:41.660 --> 39:57.660
It sounds interesting because if Guitar Freaks now comes out later this time, they're going to, if it's happening, we don't know, but we can speculate that since Guitar Freaks V is coming out overseas, that maybe now is the time for it here, if it's going to come out.

39:57.660 --> 40:08.660
I'm awfully surprised that they didn't jump with that first instead of Beatmania because I think Guitar Freaks is pretty easy to market to people instead of Beatmania, whereas, you know, DJ Simulator playing a guitar, okay, that makes more sense.

40:08.660 --> 40:12.620
makes more sense. But they're also coming from the import fan base, I think. And how

40:12.620 --> 40:17.940
was DDR really successful? A lot of it was word of mouth, and Beatmania has a really

40:17.940 --> 40:22.420
rabid fan base established, although I think that rabid fan base is going to turn a little

40:22.420 --> 40:28.460
bit on a US version, just because you've seen what's happened with DDR, and people bitch

40:28.460 --> 40:32.260
because, you know, it's not as good as the Japanese versions, and I have this bad feeling

40:32.260 --> 40:35.060
the same thing's going to happen here, although we don't know yet because we haven't seen

40:35.060 --> 40:36.060
The other thing that's...

40:36.060 --> 40:37.060
But...

40:37.060 --> 40:38.060
Sorry, sorry.

40:38.060 --> 40:40.220
I just want to finish my thought here.

40:40.220 --> 40:42.140
Guitar Freaks does not have that same fan base.

40:42.140 --> 40:46.540
I mean, granted, there are loyal Guitar Freaks players out there, but you don't exactly see

40:46.540 --> 40:50.060
GuitarFreak.com or things like that.

40:50.060 --> 40:51.060
You know what I mean?

40:51.060 --> 40:55.580
Like, there's a very established BeatMania base on, like, Bamani-style, very established

40:55.580 --> 41:02.900
DDR base on DDR Freak, but no real solid Guitar Freak base, if you know what I mean.

41:02.900 --> 41:07.900
One thing to mention, though, is all the songs are full-length, so that is something kind of cool.

41:07.900 --> 41:10.900
Although I was kind of wishing that there would be some short versions, too.

41:10.900 --> 41:15.900
Kind of like how Karaoke Revolution doesn't have the option of playing a shorter or longer version of the song.

41:15.900 --> 41:18.900
Would have been nice, but still really cool.

41:19.900 --> 41:20.900
Yeah.

41:20.900 --> 41:24.900
Now, the other thing, though, this other story that they're doing about In the Groove, though,

41:24.900 --> 41:28.900
I couldn't help but think that this story's been done before.

41:28.900 --> 41:34.860
the whole, like, oh, people using the game to lose weight. I mean, come on. It's been

41:34.860 --> 41:38.540
done with DDR. It's just another freaking game ripping off on DDR. Of course, you're

41:38.540 --> 41:41.660
going to lose weight because you're moving around. It's just the same story all over

41:41.660 --> 41:44.260
again, though. I didn't really see why they were covering that.

41:44.260 --> 41:46.620
But they didn't talk to you guys about that story at all.

41:46.620 --> 41:49.140
No, they didn't. They didn't. But they're talking to other people in the community.

41:49.140 --> 41:53.980
But still, it's the same thing. It's like, you know, I don't know. It'd be like, you

41:53.980 --> 42:17.980
doing a story about, like, oh, teen people are playing violent video games, like Grand Theft Auto, and, you know, some people are saying that it's causing kids to commit murder. Okay, now we have kids playing a game called 25 to Life, which is just like Grand Theft Auto, but now we're going to cover the same story all over again, just with another game. It's really repetitive.

42:17.980 --> 42:22.980
I just find it hilarious that we're still getting all this crap about

42:22.980 --> 42:27.980
video games cause violence, yet it's been proven that they don't.

42:32.980 --> 42:37.980
But people want to ignore facts and, you know, have their scandal. So, what can we do about it, huh?

42:37.980 --> 42:40.980
What else will the media say about video games?

42:40.980 --> 42:46.480
Now we're going to get this one. Orange Jones Radio is saying that video games don't cause violence.

42:46.480 --> 42:47.980
You know what causes violence?

42:47.980 --> 42:48.980
People cause violence.

42:48.980 --> 42:50.980
Sucked up people cause violence.

42:50.980 --> 42:53.980
I cause violence.

42:53.980 --> 42:57.980
Guns don't kill people. I do.

42:57.980 --> 43:01.980
Nah, I don't know. It looks like a good game. I'm really looking forward to it.

43:01.980 --> 43:03.980
It's supposed to be coming out I guess in November.

43:03.980 --> 43:04.980
Guitar Hero?

43:04.980 --> 43:09.980
Yeah. So it'll be good. Yeah, not really much more to say.

43:09.980 --> 43:13.380
I want to play it. I'm pissed I didn't get to go and be a media whore like you two.

43:13.380 --> 43:17.980
I got a lot of footage of me playing the game. I did, however, slip.

43:17.980 --> 43:22.740
Did you say it's so fun? I didn't say it's so much fun, but I said

43:22.740 --> 43:26.420
it's so fun. So that's almost as bad.

43:26.420 --> 43:30.420
And I know what you're hoping. Dear God.

43:30.420 --> 43:35.500
Dear God. Whenever there's a YM talking, whatever they are called.

43:35.500 --> 43:38.300
I'm praying here. Dear God, who art in heaven.

43:38.300 --> 43:43.860
Please, I've been a good boy this year and I go to church every Sunday.

43:43.860 --> 43:48.340
Okay, even if that church is called Burger King, who cares?

43:48.340 --> 43:51.460
I praise God in my own special way.

43:51.460 --> 43:55.700
God, don't listen to him. I'm praying. God,

43:55.700 --> 44:01.180
if you're listening right now, I really, really, really, really, really want

44:01.180 --> 44:04.400
KCRA to use the clip of Loki going,

44:04.400 --> 44:07.700
this is so fun and nothing else in

44:07.700 --> 44:12.200
God please show lots of Jamie in the story show lots and lots of Jamie but

44:12.200 --> 44:12.700
please

44:12.700 --> 44:16.200
only show Loki saying it's oh so much fun or whatever the hell he said

44:16.200 --> 44:19.600
I appreciate it love and amen Rob

44:19.600 --> 44:23.600
Jesus Christ

44:23.600 --> 44:27.400
I even caught my sulfur after I'm like ah shit

44:27.400 --> 44:32.600
I can't wait

44:32.600 --> 44:36.600
I'm gonna have my TiVo ready.

44:36.600 --> 44:40.600
I know I'm gonna watch it and be disappointed again.

44:40.600 --> 44:44.600
Just gonna be disappointed.

44:44.600 --> 44:48.600
Alright, we'll see what happens. At least you guys get to be on TV, I'm not even there.

44:48.600 --> 44:52.600
I'm just gonna pretend to be bitter about it for a while, so. Nah, that's cool.

44:52.600 --> 44:56.600
I probably actually, I probably won't even be in it. I'll just be

44:56.600 --> 45:00.600
playing the guitar game. Or you'll see your feet. Or your hands. Cause your feet were in the paper

45:00.600 --> 45:02.600
So why not have your hands on TV? That'd be pretty cool.

45:02.600 --> 45:03.600
Yeah, the hands might work.

45:03.600 --> 45:04.600
Alright.

45:04.600 --> 45:06.600
Or I'll be doing something retarded.

45:06.600 --> 45:11.600
Because I was trying to over-exaggerate the movements that you would play during the game

45:11.600 --> 45:13.600
in hopes of more TV time.

45:13.600 --> 45:14.600
But...

45:14.600 --> 45:21.600
So we're gonna see this clip of Loki during the whammy bar like he's gonna drop to his knees

45:21.600 --> 45:22.600
and go,

45:22.600 --> 45:25.600
I should've done that shit!

45:25.600 --> 45:27.600
I wasn't thinking. See, I didn't prepare.

45:27.600 --> 45:34.600
It's gonna be like that scene in Risky Business where Loki just comes out in a t-shirt in his undies and slides across the floor playing the guitar.

45:34.600 --> 45:36.600
That's what we're gonna see on the news.

45:36.600 --> 45:40.600
I remember one time Dan bringing out my DDR pad on Dreamcast.

45:40.600 --> 45:42.600
Cause it was just sitting there.

45:42.600 --> 45:49.600
And grabbing one of the Guitar Freaks guitars and then rolling around on the floor being a freak, wailing hard.

45:49.600 --> 45:54.600
So he decided that they needed a new game using the iToy called Air Guitar Freaks.

45:54.600 --> 45:55.600
Have it.

45:55.600 --> 45:57.840
Why not? They can do Samba de Amigo with the...

45:57.840 --> 46:00.120
They have a guitar game in iToyPlay3.

46:00.120 --> 46:00.880
What?

46:00.880 --> 46:01.680
Yeah, air guitar.

46:01.680 --> 46:03.240
There's an iToyPlay3?

46:03.240 --> 46:03.640
Yes.

46:03.640 --> 46:04.320
I didn't know that.

46:04.320 --> 46:05.720
Yeah, no one buys them!

46:05.720 --> 46:06.880
iToyPlay1 sucks!

46:06.880 --> 46:11.720
Okay, they have iToyPlay1, iToyPlay2, iToyPlay3, and SpyToy.

46:11.720 --> 46:12.960
They also have iToyChat.

46:12.960 --> 46:13.760
SpyToy?

46:13.760 --> 46:14.840
SpyToy.

46:14.840 --> 46:17.960
Does that mean you can use it to spy on your neighbors who have iToys in their houses?

46:17.960 --> 46:23.360
No, you can use it as a surveillance system, and you can also play spy-themed games.

46:23.360 --> 46:27.360
Let me tell you, there's a lot of itoy games out there that you never hear about, because they suck.

46:27.360 --> 46:28.360
All of them suck.

46:28.360 --> 46:32.360
I want to get itoy chat, and then just sit on the couch naked.

46:37.360 --> 46:39.360
Is that wrong?

46:39.360 --> 46:41.360
Do you need to pray again?

46:41.360 --> 46:42.360
No, I don't.

46:42.360 --> 46:46.360
Dear God, please! Don't let this haven go to hell!

46:46.360 --> 46:48.360
Okay. Stop stealing my bit.

46:48.360 --> 46:54.360
I just want to get itoy chat and then just, you know, join the room and hey guys, what's

46:54.360 --> 46:55.360
up?

46:55.360 --> 46:56.760
I'm just letting it all hang out tonight.

46:56.760 --> 46:58.360
What are you guys up to?

46:58.360 --> 47:00.280
Do they moderate on itoy chat?

47:00.280 --> 47:01.280
How can they?

47:01.280 --> 47:02.280
They can't moderate that, can they?

47:02.280 --> 47:09.360
You can do, I think, up to 20 or 15 people per room or whatever and you can chat via

47:09.360 --> 47:11.760
video and voice.

47:11.760 --> 47:14.760
I think you can do up to 100 people via text chat.

47:14.760 --> 47:16.420
Do they have adult rated rooms, though?

47:16.420 --> 47:18.280
Because like, you know, look at Yahoo!

47:18.280 --> 47:22.040
like the yahoo messenger program, you can do webcams on yahoo

47:22.040 --> 47:26.240
but the only thing i know that people use that yahoo cam thing for

47:26.240 --> 47:28.420
is for sex

47:28.420 --> 47:32.320
or web sex, whatever they call it, cam sex, whatever the hell they call it. Well, I'm not into cam sex

47:32.320 --> 47:37.360
I'm not going to not cam sex for those of you that are into it. Here's the really crappy stuff you can do, you can actually play games

47:37.360 --> 47:38.440
like they have

47:38.440 --> 47:40.680
you know chess, maybe you can do strip chess

47:40.680 --> 47:41.720
bank of the monkey

47:41.720 --> 47:46.640
strip battleship. Wait, you can play chess using your hands and stuff?

47:46.640 --> 47:51.240
you can play chess or any appendage that you can play um... battleship or

47:51.240 --> 47:54.880
naval war is what they call it

47:54.880 --> 47:58.640
oh you suck my battleship

47:58.640 --> 48:00.800
oh baby sink it

48:00.800 --> 48:02.520
but anyways uh...

48:02.520 --> 48:04.880
no they've got uh...

48:04.880 --> 48:07.540
a lot of weird games in this thing uh...

48:07.540 --> 48:09.600
it says you can do

48:09.600 --> 48:10.920
what the hell

48:10.920 --> 48:14.000
i think you can just make your own rules

48:14.000 --> 48:20.000
That would sell some itoys. You can turn into a videophone, so I guess.

48:20.000 --> 48:30.000
But you know that there would be underage porn, because all the 16 and 17 year olds that have itoys are going to run around naked on it, and that's just wrong. We can't have that.

48:30.000 --> 48:38.360
you know, so. Yeah, I don't know, I don't know about that, but yeah, Itoy Chat 3, in

48:38.360 --> 48:47.840
fact, if I remember correctly, I think that came out last month. I just, I know that these

48:47.840 --> 48:57.240
games sucked, so. I played, I played Itoy Play 2 at E3 and I was thoroughly unimpressed.

48:57.240 --> 49:03.240
I was more impressed with the Harry Potter I-Toy game than I was with I-Toy Play 2.

49:03.240 --> 49:06.240
And even though Harry Potter games...

49:06.240 --> 49:09.240
Come on folks, doesn't this look a little disgusting?

49:09.240 --> 49:12.240
I'm going to show you a picture, of course this is a great radio.

49:12.240 --> 49:13.240
Post it in the chat.

49:13.240 --> 49:15.240
I mean, that doesn't look...

49:15.240 --> 49:16.240
Wow!

49:16.240 --> 49:17.240
Wow!

49:17.240 --> 49:18.240
Post that in the chat.

49:18.240 --> 49:19.240
Please post that in chat.

49:19.240 --> 49:21.240
That's orangehonestradio.com.

49:21.240 --> 49:22.240
Click on chat.

49:22.240 --> 49:26.240
It's these people, and the game is blowing up balloons.

49:26.240 --> 49:33.800
balloons, but the way the balloons are positioned, it looks like you're blowing up a boner.

49:33.800 --> 49:38.760
And this one woman on the end with her yellow balloon, she's all into it. She's like, oh,

49:38.760 --> 49:46.680
damn, what's the, oh, I got a big balloon. I don't know, what the hell, that's great.

49:46.680 --> 49:52.320
Please check that out in chat. Yeah, it's really bad. They have another one called Call

49:52.320 --> 50:01.040
kitty. I guess, I don't know. And this looks really weird. I don't know what the hell this

50:01.040 --> 50:09.920
game... No one should play itoy games ever. I mean, I don't think anyone should actually

50:09.920 --> 50:15.320
buy the itoy. I talked about doing this a while back, you know. I have a ton of itoy

50:15.320 --> 50:18.720
games. We should just really do a review of all the itoy games out there, because it'll

50:18.720 --> 50:22.220
like five minutes I mean really there's not that much I've only played I toy

50:22.220 --> 50:27.420

My bad.

58:41.020 --> 58:42.020
Well, we'll just come back cold.

58:42.020 --> 58:46.900
Hi, we're back on Orange Lounge Radio, unprofessional internet radio.

58:46.900 --> 58:47.980
We do this shit for free.

58:47.980 --> 58:48.980
What can we say?

58:48.980 --> 58:51.300
Mistakes happen once in a while.

58:51.300 --> 58:57.700
All right, here we are back on the show and we're going to talk a little bit about some

58:57.700 --> 58:59.460
Some things, just random things.

58:59.460 --> 59:01.580
Exafir, you wanted to share something with our listeners, then we're going to get on

59:01.580 --> 59:02.580
Skype, guys.

59:02.580 --> 59:03.580
It's about bleached assholes.

59:03.580 --> 59:04.580
No, it's not about bleached assholes.

59:04.580 --> 59:05.580
It is about bleached assholes.

59:05.580 --> 59:10.980
Well, you know, it may be about bleached assholes one of these days.

59:10.980 --> 59:20.820
So I'm actually in the process of having my own show on orangelandsradio.com, and you

59:20.820 --> 59:26.020
all should listen, and it's going to be on Mondays, and it's going to be called Exafir's

59:26.020 --> 59:30.980
case of the Mondays, and it's a good show for all of you that are wanting to, you know,

59:30.980 --> 59:35.820
start off your week with something a little bit light and something you don't have to

59:35.820 --> 59:40.860
really pay attention. Plus, I'll say a lot of really horrible things on it, probably.

59:40.860 --> 59:46.860
So you guys should all listen. Uh, yeah.

59:46.860 --> 59:47.860
When's the state viewing?

59:47.860 --> 59:48.860
Yay!

59:48.860 --> 59:50.860

59:50.860 --> 59:57.860
Hopefully a week from tomorrow, and I'm hoping that it will be 7 to 9.

59:57.860 --> 01:00:03.860
I will talk about video games for all of you that are into that sort of thing, I don't know.

01:00:03.860 --> 01:00:07.860
And then for the other hour, cause we're talking about Captain Tight Pants.

01:00:07.860 --> 01:00:10.860
I will talk about Captain Tight Pants.

01:00:10.860 --> 01:00:15.860
It's for all of the, you know, Orange Lawn's radio is filled with straight guys,

01:00:15.860 --> 01:00:19.860
so I feel like, hey, I'll be the queer voice for the straight guys here.

01:00:19.860 --> 01:00:27.120
Hello. Oh, no, no, no, like I'm not a guy no straight straight people. Sorry PC straight people

01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:32.160
Oh wait, so you so you basically extra verse case of the Monday is like it's it's very queer

01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:36.180
Eye for the gamer guy for people who don't enjoy it for the game gay

01:00:36.900 --> 01:00:38.420
Nevermind

01:00:38.420 --> 01:00:41.420
What were you saying queer ear for the straight?

01:00:43.060 --> 01:00:49.100
Queer voice for the straight guys ear. That's what I said. Okay. Well, no, um queer cock for the straight guys ass

01:00:49.100 --> 01:00:55.700
No, I'm going to, you know, it's not like you guys can hear a gay guy talk, it's not

01:00:55.700 --> 01:00:59.260

Okay. Well, right now, I mean, you can still email me at my

podcast email, I'll forward it. Just say, 2X defer.

01:01:57.800 --> 01:02:02.220
And now you're going to also be doing a lot of Buffy and Serenity talk, I'm sure.

01:02:02.220 --> 01:02:06.420
I'm sure I will, you know, and I will talk about

01:02:06.420 --> 01:02:10.540
other things as well right now

01:02:10.540 --> 01:02:15.860
like Captain Tight Pants. Also coming up a week from Wednesday if I play my cards

01:02:15.860 --> 01:02:16.340
right

01:02:16.340 --> 01:02:19.640
I will be coming back with a solo show the launch date

01:02:19.640 --> 01:02:22.780
a week from Wednesday. I know I've been talking about doing a solo show for a long

01:02:22.780 --> 01:02:23.660
long time now

01:02:23.660 --> 01:02:26.880
but it will actually happen for sure I'll be coming back

01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:31.000
a week from Wednesday. That's Captain Tight Pants? No, not Captain Tight Pants. I do not have a

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.680
name for the show yet so until I get a better name it's just gonna be the Rob

01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:34.380
Roberts show

01:02:34.380 --> 01:02:39.380
And, um, a little thing, I'm actually doing mine every other week because of school constraints.

01:02:39.380 --> 01:02:46.380
When I'm out of, when the semesters are over, I will be going back to, uh,

01:02:46.380 --> 01:02:47.380
Some, uh, regular, every week.

01:02:47.380 --> 01:02:48.380
Regular.

01:02:48.380 --> 01:02:50.380
Just for the next nine weeks, every other week.

01:02:50.380 --> 01:02:53.380
Alright, sounds good.

01:02:53.380 --> 01:02:55.380
Maybe you should call your show the Rod Roddy show.

01:02:55.380 --> 01:03:01.380
No, because he died, and that's sad.

01:03:01.380 --> 01:03:06.260
Anyway, so that's going to be coming back, and I will not talk about such gay things.

01:03:06.260 --> 01:03:09.220
I mean, I realize I'm gay, but I have other things to talk about other than, you know,

01:03:09.220 --> 01:03:10.220
who I'm fucking.

01:03:10.220 --> 01:03:15.820
So I'm going to talk about tech stuff and geeky news, and yes, some video games, but

01:03:15.820 --> 01:03:19.460
I'm going to kind of go outside the realm and talk about cool things on the interweb,

01:03:19.460 --> 01:03:20.980
and just whatever I want.

01:03:20.980 --> 01:03:24.500
It's going to be my thing to just do whatever I want, and for those of you guys that miss

01:03:24.500 --> 01:03:29.460
Vanilla Sky and Outside the Box, unfortunately, you know, I haven't gotten the folks that

01:03:29.460 --> 01:03:33.020
or on that show to commit to come back and I think we're gonna have scheduling problems

01:03:33.020 --> 01:03:36.600
but hopefully once in a while they'll drop in or something as time goes on. But for now

01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:41.560
this is just gonna be my solo thingy. But I'll try to have guests as well. So we'll

01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:49.600
be working on that. So that's it. We're gonna have live shows Monday, every other Tuesday

01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:53.640
and Wednesday. And it's only every other Tuesday for a little while. So not that long.

01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:57.680
Well also to make up though for my missing Tuesday nights I plan on occasionally doing

01:03:57.680 --> 01:04:01.680
That means you have to be listening late at the night.

01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:03.680
That's right. So it'll be a good time. Good time.

01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:06.680
All right, so lots of live stuff coming back to Orange House Radio soon.

01:04:06.680 --> 01:04:09.680
That should be fun. And Loki's still no show.

01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:11.680
Don't look at me. I'm not...

01:04:11.680 --> 01:04:14.680
I've got a fiancé that doesn't allow the...

01:04:14.680 --> 01:04:16.680
We need to give her a show.

01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:19.680
I need to friggin' play more Final Fantasy XI is what I need to do.

01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:24.680
Let's get Nellie to fill in for the weeks that Dark Sakura's not here.

01:04:24.680 --> 01:04:28.080
I want you and Nelly to be guests on my show.

01:04:28.080 --> 01:04:30.720
That'd be cool.

01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:31.720
I'll be on your show.

01:04:31.720 --> 01:04:32.720
Woo!

01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:35.160
I'm going to have everybody on my show.

01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:43.760
And we can have a Brazilian wax job show where we all wax each other.

01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:47.280
Like, ooh, that looks so good.

01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:48.280
That's okay.

01:04:48.280 --> 01:04:49.280
Anyway.

01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:50.280
Okay.

01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:51.440
Bad idea.

01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:54.480
So I want to talk about something now.

01:04:54.480 --> 01:05:00.840
last wax job? No, no, it's not sex related. Um... But they're not necessarily sexual.

01:05:00.840 --> 01:05:07.600
I did something today. Uh oh! And... Do you need to be panked? What? Do you need to be

01:05:07.600 --> 01:05:15.320
panked? Maybe. Um, it's kind of one of those things that I said I was never going to do.

01:05:15.320 --> 01:05:22.160
Just get it out, man. Just, you have one life. Live it. But, I don't know, something happened

01:05:22.160 --> 01:05:26.760
it's like you know I decided maybe I was being just a little too harsh and I

01:05:26.760 --> 01:05:39.000
needed to open up my mind a little bit and your ass and my butt so I went and I

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:43.000
picked up World of Warcraft today

01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:48.720
let's hope that miklotov is not listening right now oh I already told

01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:55.720
Let us know in the comments below and we will see you in the next video.

01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:23.440
Skyler Crusade for you guys. Alliance. Alliance on Skyler Crusade. Play a Night Elf. I will

01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:29.440
be near where you'll go. We'll see, we'll see. And then also I will be on wherever the

01:06:29.440 --> 01:06:35.520
gay one is. I think it's P something. I want to play on the gay server. So, well then I'll

01:06:35.520 --> 01:06:39.680
let you know which one that is. Okay. So, that's it. I'm on Warlord. I've already played

01:06:39.680 --> 01:06:43.560
it. I played it a little bit before tonight's show. I was playing on. Isn't it so much better?

01:06:43.560 --> 01:06:47.720
No, it's just different. You can actually. I'm not going to say it's better because it's

01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:55.720
It's different. It actually reminded me a lot of Guild Wars, but I know that World of Warcraft came first, but it plays a lot, a lot like Guild Wars.

01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:59.720
A lot, a lot like it. Why are you shaking your head disapprovingly, Loki?

01:06:59.720 --> 01:07:07.720
Just, you know, going to another game that you won't play. Whatever. I'm sticking with one game that I won't play.

01:07:07.720 --> 01:07:12.640
No, I'm not leaving Final Fantasy XI, I'm not by any means cancel my account on Final

01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:13.640
Fantasy XI.

01:07:13.640 --> 01:07:21.320
I just, I got to this point where I was like, I'm bored, and I don't want to be bored, and

01:07:21.320 --> 01:07:27.160
I feel like I'm, I don't have enough time to invest in the game, so, and I'm never going

01:07:27.160 --> 01:07:32.800
to be able to participate in the way the game is set up in a lot of the end game events

01:07:32.800 --> 01:07:34.520
because I have no time to play.

01:07:34.520 --> 01:07:39.040
So I just wanted to find another game to fill casually my time, but I do have a lot of friends

01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:42.360
that still play Final Fantasy XI and I do plan on doing some things in it, just very

01:07:42.360 --> 01:07:43.520
limited.

01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:44.520
For now.

01:07:44.520 --> 01:07:45.520
For now.

01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:46.520
While I test out World of Warcraft.

01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:47.520
I don't know.

01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:48.520
I may hate this game.

01:07:48.520 --> 01:07:49.860
I may play it for a month and then decide it sucks and I miss Final Fantasy XI.

01:07:49.860 --> 01:07:51.560
I completely understand.

01:07:51.560 --> 01:07:54.120
That's why I stopped feeding Taco.

01:07:54.120 --> 01:07:55.120
You're a Nintendonk.

01:07:55.120 --> 01:07:56.120
You know what?

01:07:56.120 --> 01:07:59.560
I've decided that when Dan and I get a dog, because I'm gonna get a dog, I'm gonna get

01:07:59.560 --> 01:08:02.880
a long-haired chihuahua and name it Taco for you.

01:08:02.880 --> 01:08:06.840
I think that is the best name of the dog ever.

01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:11.180
I'll take care of Taco.

01:08:11.180 --> 01:08:15.380
So that was my big secret. I finally caved.

01:08:15.380 --> 01:08:16.300
And I bought World of Warcraft.

01:08:16.300 --> 01:08:20.640
It's alright. You'll just switch to the next big thing when World of Warcraft comes out.

01:08:20.640 --> 01:08:25.000
I'll stick with Final Fantasy XI since I don't even know what's going on now.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:28.120
And they've added another update and they're doing the

01:08:28.120 --> 01:08:31.940
launch of that Treasures of whatever the hell it's called that's going to be coming out

01:08:31.940 --> 01:08:35.200
again with... I do want to check that out. With more player classes and

01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:38.460
you know it's... I'm hoping that

01:08:38.460 --> 01:08:43.100
for... I know it's probably not going to happen. I'm hoping that the Xbox 360 version

01:08:43.100 --> 01:08:46.740
is on the same servers because then that could just, you know... It will be.

01:08:46.740 --> 01:08:50.980
Well I'm not sure about that because it might be on Xbox

01:08:50.980 --> 01:08:55.140
or Microsoft servers in which case, you know, then you won't be able to play with other people.

01:08:55.140 --> 01:08:58.300
If it is, then I can cancel my Play Online account

01:08:58.300 --> 01:09:03.820
And just play for my xbox live and they'll kind of cut down on costs a bit plus i'll be able to you know

01:09:04.220 --> 01:09:06.220
Have the game looking better

01:09:06.380 --> 01:09:10.620
We need katamari the and then the rpg that'd be badass

01:09:11.580 --> 01:09:13.580
That'd be weird

01:09:14.220 --> 01:09:17.500
I need to roll over the king. So that was it. That was my big secret

01:09:19.260 --> 01:09:21.260
Shane's not speaking to me now

01:09:21.580 --> 01:09:22.940
It's all right

01:09:22.940 --> 01:09:26.460
There's one thing I want to add about where the warcraft is. Um, I like how you can um,

01:09:26.460 --> 01:09:34.460
Go to UI sites and kind of customize the way you can cast your spells or whatever.

01:09:34.460 --> 01:09:36.460
I think that's really cool. You can't do that in Final Fantasy.

01:09:36.460 --> 01:09:38.460
Well, I guess you could.

01:09:38.460 --> 01:09:40.460
You have to set up a macro for it.

01:09:40.460 --> 01:09:47.460
I like that you don't have to play with people if you don't want to and you don't have to be the party bitch like I used to be.

01:09:47.460 --> 01:09:50.460
I know. They're different. I'm not going to compare the games.

01:09:50.460 --> 01:09:53.460
I like playing it through it because I can kick their ass into myself.

01:09:53.460 --> 01:09:59.460
I don't like chatting with people in chat rooms, but only to myself because talking with other people online is awful.

01:10:00.460 --> 01:10:06.460
No. There's a difference between talking to other people and then having to actually play with strangers.

01:10:06.460 --> 01:10:09.460
It's still interacting. Still the same argument.

01:10:09.460 --> 01:10:11.460
Do these strangers have candy? Because I like candy.

01:10:11.460 --> 01:10:12.460
Rob, I'm gonna get you.

01:10:12.460 --> 01:10:23.460
Rob, they showed us this really cool trailer sizzle reel, as they call them in the industry, for the movies coming out. They showed Strangers with Candy the movie. It looked freaking awesome.

01:10:23.460 --> 01:10:24.460
Oh, I can't wait.

01:10:24.460 --> 01:10:25.460
I can't wait.

01:10:25.460 --> 01:10:26.460
Can't wait.

01:10:26.460 --> 01:10:30.460
Extrovert, will you tell Shane to stop hating me? He's mad at me.

01:10:30.460 --> 01:10:31.460
Is he listening?

01:10:31.460 --> 01:10:32.460
Yeah.

01:10:32.460 --> 01:10:33.460
Oh.

01:10:33.460 --> 01:10:36.460
Shane, he's impulsive.

01:10:36.460 --> 01:10:37.460
You know.

01:10:37.460 --> 01:10:40.460
You were encouraging me.

01:10:40.460 --> 01:10:41.460
I think that...

01:10:41.460 --> 01:10:52.820
Well, yeah, I was unapologetically saying that, but it's like, I'm impulsive, too.

01:10:52.820 --> 01:10:58.300
And I'm not going to really probably play, I'm going to probably play your buddy pass,

01:10:58.300 --> 01:11:00.780
but I mean, that's going to be limited.

01:11:00.780 --> 01:11:03.500
I'm having a fun time with Final Fantasy XI right now.

01:11:03.500 --> 01:11:06.740
I'm like really enjoying it, and I'm still a white mage.

01:11:06.740 --> 01:11:10.540
I mean, that's the weird part about it, is like, I've actually enjoyed-

01:11:10.540 --> 01:11:12.040
You're the party bitch, too, right?

01:11:12.040 --> 01:11:21.040
Yes, yes, I've been the party bitch, but, like, it's been actually okay, because I've been learning the skill of it all, and I'm 15 right now.

01:11:21.040 --> 01:11:24.540
So, I mean, I'm kind of working at it, but it's going well.

01:11:26.540 --> 01:11:30.040
I got tired of being the party bitch, so I just let the ingrates die.

01:11:31.540 --> 01:11:34.540
I do that, too! In fact, I do-

01:11:34.540 --> 01:11:40.040
If they don't come running for the signal for the freaking party buff, fuck them. They don't get fucked.

01:11:40.040 --> 01:11:44.040
I'll delete. That's what I'm saying.

01:11:44.040 --> 01:11:47.040
They just don't get left.

01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:49.040
Bitch, you weren't there.

01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:52.040
I have the instant, you know, bad party remedy.

01:11:52.040 --> 01:11:56.040
It's wonderful having the cable modem right on my desk because I can just, boop.

01:11:56.040 --> 01:11:59.040
Look at that. My connection went down.

01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:02.040
I wonder how that happened. Oh, the cord fell out.

01:12:02.040 --> 01:12:06.040
Oh, damn it. Oh, well.

01:12:06.040 --> 01:12:08.040
I guess I won't log back in.

01:12:08.040 --> 01:12:13.760
I'll never figure out how to put this cord back in until at least a couple days from

01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:14.760
now.

01:12:14.760 --> 01:12:15.760
Nope.

01:12:15.760 --> 01:12:17.000
All right.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:20.440
We're going to go to the Skype line, guys.

01:12:20.440 --> 01:12:24.600

01:12:53.720 --> 01:12:59.540
Oh, random aside, Sakurina reminded me of something here. BeatMania2DX is actually in

01:12:59.540 --> 01:13:02.220
world of warcraft credits

01:13:02.220 --> 01:13:04.880
but in the special bank section or something

01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:08.220
like they credit the game with i guess passing the time while they were coding

01:13:08.220 --> 01:13:09.180
the game i don't know

01:13:09.180 --> 01:13:10.180

Tell us, tell us.

01:13:41.120 --> 01:13:47.520
The starters, uh, the DDR tournament there, got shit, got, got coverage. It got shitloads of coverage, um...

01:13:47.520 --> 01:13:48.520
Like, what kind of coverage?

01:13:48.520 --> 01:13:58.020
Uh, MTV was filming there, you know, yesterday, for a better part of, uh, the freestyle div- uh, freestyle division, and you wouldn't believe this.

01:13:58.020 --> 01:14:06.020
NBC ended up filming a sitcom, part of an episode of the sitcom in the center stage after Freestyle.

01:14:06.020 --> 01:14:08.020
What? What sitcom do you know?

01:14:08.020 --> 01:14:14.020
I don't know, but it was just two white guys just dancing right there on a fifth mix.

01:14:14.020 --> 01:14:17.020
The Drip Machine climax basic.

01:14:17.020 --> 01:14:19.020
Like My Name is Ero or something?

01:14:19.020 --> 01:14:25.020
I don't know, just two white guys dancing, yeah, doing like you got served thing on a DDR pad.

01:14:25.020 --> 01:14:27.620
And they, yeah, they pretty much shot that scene there.

01:14:27.620 --> 01:14:28.380
Should be interesting.

01:14:28.380 --> 01:14:29.500
Were they both flamey?

01:14:30.700 --> 01:14:32.780
No, Wailing, GDR's already been on Will and Grace.

01:14:32.780 --> 01:14:33.340
Oh, it has?

01:14:33.340 --> 01:14:33.780
Yes.

01:14:33.780 --> 01:14:34.020
Oh.

01:14:34.020 --> 01:14:41.900
Yeah, but, okay, I also got, I also might have to snag a few things from the, from the Red Octane booth, which was right next to the tournament area.

01:14:42.500 --> 01:14:45.020
Behold, the link that I'm posting up right now.

01:14:45.580 --> 01:14:49.860
I'm at, you wouldn't believe who I managed to meet, Kyle Ward, from In the Groove.

01:14:51.540 --> 01:14:52.100
Hello?

01:14:52.100 --> 01:14:56.300
Yeah, I mean, I was so shocked, I was speechless, Zaku.

01:14:56.300 --> 01:15:00.300
Oh, what is this?

01:15:05.300 --> 01:15:08.900
Zaku, I fucking love you. You just went up like a hundred points in my book.

01:15:08.900 --> 01:15:12.100
What the fuck is that?

01:15:12.100 --> 01:15:18.100
Zaku got the person who wrote all the songs in In The Groove to autograph something for us.

01:15:18.100 --> 01:15:36.100
I'm gonna send that to you sometime this week. Just give me an address to send it to.

01:15:36.100 --> 01:15:37.100
That is beautiful.

01:15:37.100 --> 01:15:44.100
Also, I managed to play Guitar Hero this weekend. I managed to play Guitar Hero this weekend.

01:15:44.100 --> 01:15:59.100
Um, just one word, it's really hard for beginners to pick up, since you literally not only have to hit the button, but you know, one of the buttons on the neck, but you also have to hit, you know, the little tab right there with the square there that makes up the strings.

01:15:59.100 --> 01:16:06.100
Exactly, I can't contain myself, we're all looking at the pictures and I'm giggling and I can't stop laughing, this is the coolest thing ever.

01:16:06.100 --> 01:16:12.060
okay but it's not as cool as well you know but it's basically not as cool as

01:16:12.060 --> 01:16:16.900
this oh I had in the group two on a slim PS they had in the group two on running

01:16:16.900 --> 01:16:24.340
on a ps2 okay after burn with red octane after burners that's cool okay so they

01:16:24.340 --> 01:16:29.940
so how how is that well it's just the same thing I know I know Kyle Ward would

01:16:29.940 --> 01:16:33.260
didn't want to say that much about when it was gonna be released all I know is

01:16:33.260 --> 01:16:40.260
is that I saw In the Group 2 running on a PS2, and I got to play it on After Burners.

01:16:40.260 --> 01:16:44.260
To be honest, though, In the Group 2 coming out on PS2 is kind of a duh.

01:16:44.260 --> 01:16:46.260
I mean, we know it's going to happen at some point, but...

01:16:46.260 --> 01:16:47.260
Loki?

01:16:47.260 --> 01:16:49.260
Well, the thing, though, is that it...

01:16:49.260 --> 01:16:54.260
That and they also had DDR Mario Mix, you know, playable over there.

01:16:54.260 --> 01:16:55.260
Hold on, Loki has a dot.

01:16:55.260 --> 01:16:59.260
It was a pretty long line trying to get through there.

01:16:59.260 --> 01:17:06.260
If it's right off of Slim PS2, then that means it's not a beta kit, so that means it's probably done.

01:17:06.260 --> 01:17:11.260
Yeah, it's probably a build. It's probably an early build. It had all the songs in it, though.

01:17:11.260 --> 01:17:12.260
Interesting.

01:17:12.260 --> 01:17:14.260
Yeah, I had it. Mm-hmm.

01:17:14.260 --> 01:17:15.260
Okay, okay, so...

01:17:15.260 --> 01:17:18.260
You know, I said before...

01:17:18.260 --> 01:17:19.260
How was DDR with Mario?

01:17:19.260 --> 01:17:20.260
Huh?

01:17:20.260 --> 01:17:21.260
How was DDR with Mario?

01:17:21.260 --> 01:17:28.260
I did get a chance to play it, but I saw folks, you know, because the lines were pretty big for that and I didn't have enough time.

01:17:28.260 --> 01:17:36.020
But, you know, it looks like a regular DDR mix, except, you know, obviously it's a license.

01:17:36.020 --> 01:17:37.520
Yeah, and it's way easier.

01:17:38.400 --> 01:17:42.160
That, and from what I hear, there's no mods on it.

01:17:42.160 --> 01:17:44.520
You can't even pick speed mods on that mix.

01:17:44.520 --> 01:17:45.520
Oh, I didn't know that.

01:17:46.720 --> 01:17:48.820
Yeah, that's what I heard.

01:17:48.820 --> 01:17:49.320
Hmm.

01:17:49.620 --> 01:17:53.420
I don't know if it's true, and the only way to find out is by getting it.

01:17:53.420 --> 01:17:55.720
Uh, let me see, what else can I say?

01:17:55.720 --> 01:17:57.720
Xbox 360

01:17:58.280 --> 01:18:00.960
Obviously, yeah, they were they did have some on display

01:18:01.520 --> 01:18:07.680
It wasn't that much free shit or to go around over there as well. I didn't ask to get an in the group to t-shirt

01:18:10.520 --> 01:18:17.560
Yeah, and that's it what did you do you did you do your did you do your tequila thing in the tournament register for?

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:21.600
No, I didn't I didn't I didn't have the time for the money

01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:29.600
But as I said, you know, MTV got, you know, got plenty of coverage on yesterday.

01:18:29.600 --> 01:18:31.600
They were pretty much filming there.

01:18:31.600 --> 01:18:38.600
They were focusing on like two players that I know through DDR.

01:18:38.600 --> 01:18:42.600
And that's pretty much what I've seen.

01:18:42.600 --> 01:18:44.600
I'm trying to remember what else.

01:18:44.600 --> 01:18:46.600
Yeah, lots of Halo.

01:18:46.600 --> 01:18:47.600
All right.

01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:51.600
MTV is actually backing Guitar Hero officially.

01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:52.600
Who is?

01:18:52.600 --> 01:18:53.600
MTV.

01:18:53.600 --> 01:18:54.600
Really?

01:18:54.600 --> 01:18:55.600
Yeah.

01:18:55.600 --> 01:18:56.600
Interesting.

01:18:56.600 --> 01:18:58.600
And like I said earlier, Gibson Guitars.

01:18:58.600 --> 01:19:01.600
That's going to be a pretty big music game, we'll see.

01:19:01.600 --> 01:19:02.600
Yeah.

01:19:02.600 --> 01:19:09.600
Alright, Zaku, I can't thank you enough for getting Ka, or what is he called, Keel's call?

01:19:09.600 --> 01:19:11.600
I don't remember, he's called by both.

01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:14.600
Keel, thank you so much for getting him to autograph something saying that we brought.

01:19:14.600 --> 01:19:16.600
It's only fair, we were playing his music back that day.

01:19:16.600 --> 01:19:19.600
That is awesome, I'm so excited.

01:19:19.600 --> 01:19:22.600
Just give me an address and send it to me, I'll get it to you.

01:19:22.600 --> 01:19:26.600
Look for a private message from me very soon, and we'll send you something from the private wallet exchange.

01:19:26.600 --> 01:19:27.600
Alright man.

01:19:27.600 --> 01:19:28.600
Okay?

01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:29.600
Alright man.

01:19:29.600 --> 01:19:30.600
Have a good one, thank you for calling.

01:19:30.600 --> 01:19:31.600
Alright, later.

01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:32.600
Later, bye.

01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:36.600
That's too funny.

01:19:36.600 --> 01:19:37.600
I'm sorry, that's great.

01:19:37.600 --> 01:19:43.600
At least it wasn't addressed to myself or DarkSakura, I mean, because that would have been even step up and funny.

01:19:43.600 --> 01:19:44.600
Still though, still though.

01:19:44.600 --> 01:19:45.600
It's so cool.

01:19:45.600 --> 01:19:46.600
That's pretty funny.

01:19:46.600 --> 01:19:47.600
Yeah.

01:19:47.600 --> 01:19:48.600
All right.

01:19:48.600 --> 01:19:49.600
Let's go to another call.

01:19:49.600 --> 01:19:50.600
Hello.

01:19:50.600 --> 01:19:51.600
You're on Orange Launch Radio.

01:19:51.600 --> 01:19:52.600
Hi.

01:19:52.600 --> 01:19:53.600
Sephiroth1215 here.

01:19:53.600 --> 01:19:54.600
Hello, Sephiroth1215.

01:19:54.600 --> 01:19:57.920
What's on your mind?

01:19:57.920 --> 01:20:03.840
I have to say that I'm pretty pissed because I went to Digital Life today and missed everything.

01:20:03.840 --> 01:20:04.960
And missed everything?

01:20:04.960 --> 01:20:06.200
What happened?

01:20:06.200 --> 01:20:07.200
Did everybody leave?

01:20:07.200 --> 01:20:08.200
No.

01:20:08.200 --> 01:20:09.200
Today just sucked.

01:20:09.200 --> 01:20:11.520
I mean, it was crowded.

01:20:11.520 --> 01:20:12.840
I couldn't play one game.

01:20:12.840 --> 01:20:21.000
The only thing I was able to play was Guitar Hero once, and I got to play DDR with Mario.

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:26.800
But otherwise, you couldn't even play in the DDR machines they had there, and all the good

01:20:26.800 --> 01:20:30.920
stuff they were giving away for free over at Red Octane were gone.

01:20:30.920 --> 01:20:31.920
Wow.

01:20:31.920 --> 01:20:35.460
Well, they let anybody into digital life, right?

01:20:35.460 --> 01:20:37.700
Pretty much, you don't have to be in the industry or anything, right?

01:20:37.700 --> 01:20:40.160
You just get to go, pay your admission fee, right?

01:20:40.160 --> 01:20:41.160
Yeah.

01:20:41.160 --> 01:20:45.160
You probably got way, way more people than they were thinking?

01:20:45.160 --> 01:20:48.160
Maybe. It was pretty crowded today.

01:20:48.160 --> 01:20:51.160
Interesting. I wanted to get more people in E3, probably.

01:20:51.160 --> 01:20:55.160
I really wanted to go, but I was stuck here in California,

01:20:55.160 --> 01:21:00.160
unable to get some time off to come out there, or I should say fly out there.

01:21:00.160 --> 01:21:04.160
Did you observe anything else that was cool?

01:21:04.160 --> 01:21:08.160
I took a while to look at the finals of the DDR tournament, which was okay,

01:21:08.160 --> 01:21:13.800
went by really, really slow. Because every time people went up and they got off, they

01:21:13.800 --> 01:21:20.080
had to fix the machine again. Wow. It took a long time. But a friend of mine actually

01:21:20.080 --> 01:21:28.360
won a free DDR rental machine. What, like won a machine? Well, to rent. Oh. So like

01:21:28.360 --> 01:21:33.840
for his next house party, he can get a free DDR machine for the party? Yeah, pretty much.

01:21:33.840 --> 01:21:38.480
she wants to run a tournament for himself. That's kind of cool, I guess. I'd probably

01:21:38.480 --> 01:21:42.560
do something similar. I've always wanted to get a DDR machine on the back of a truck and

01:21:42.560 --> 01:21:48.560
go driving around town having a tournament on the back of the truck. I don't like that.

01:21:48.560 --> 01:21:56.740
How long can you stand up? I'm sorry, what? When it came to other games, though, the whole

01:21:56.740 --> 01:22:04.380
thing was just full of Xboxes. Like, I found a few PS2s and, like, two Gamecubes. But,

01:22:04.380 --> 01:22:08.740
otherwise, they're all mainly games I didn't really care too much about. And even the old

01:22:08.740 --> 01:22:12.180
games, they have big lines for them that are even out right now.

01:22:12.180 --> 01:22:18.540
Wow. But the 360 preview wasn't too bad. I mean,

01:22:18.540 --> 01:22:28.540
I mean, they showed a lot of the most recent, I guess, more than where you can see D3, I don't know, but...

01:22:28.540 --> 01:22:41.540
Anyways, a real quick segue here. What you're talking about, like the DDR tournament on the back of a truck, there might be of the Jackass sketch where they were doing roller disco in the back of a van, and they were driving it around like a moving van.

01:22:41.540 --> 01:22:48.540
That's pretty funny, so I guess it could work.

01:22:48.540 --> 01:22:53.540
I'd want to rent a DDR machine and drop that off a building and see what happens.

01:22:53.540 --> 01:22:56.540
Like, you know how Letterman always does that on his show, like he throws things off a building to see what happens?

01:22:56.540 --> 01:22:59.540
I want to rent a DDR machine to throw it off a building and see what happens.

01:22:59.540 --> 01:23:01.540
That'd be pretty cool.

01:23:01.540 --> 01:23:06.540
Anyway, sorry for that aside there, we just had to get that out of our system.

01:23:06.540 --> 01:23:10.580
So are you going to be interested in picking up an Xbox 360 based on what you saw today?

01:23:10.580 --> 01:23:14.100
I was already going to get one anyway because I always

01:23:14.100 --> 01:23:19.180
just get the systems no matter what so I don't even care too much about the Xbox but

01:23:19.180 --> 01:23:19.540
there's

01:23:19.540 --> 01:23:24.220
always games that come out specifically for it. You know there's going to be some

01:23:24.220 --> 01:23:25.820
DDR UltraMix

01:23:25.820 --> 01:23:29.220
360 or something I think it's inevitable that we get something like that and

01:23:29.220 --> 01:23:32.180
that'll be like the must-have game of next year or the year after

01:23:32.180 --> 01:23:40.300
Yeah, sure. But, otherwise, they didn't have a lot of DS games to play. There was Mario

01:23:40.300 --> 01:23:45.540
Kart and Animal Crossing. I heard they were demoing the Wi-Fi thing a little more, because

01:23:45.540 --> 01:23:51.780
I saw some pictures on the internet of that. I didn't really get to play any of it, because

01:23:51.780 --> 01:23:55.620
there was big lines for it, so I just went over to DDR with Mario, which actually had

01:23:55.620 --> 01:24:01.460
no line. Surprise, surprise, no line for DDR with Mario. What did you think of it?

01:24:01.460 --> 01:24:11.420
It was easy, but I mean, I put on whatever I could to make it harder, and she told me

01:24:11.420 --> 01:24:18.100
to put on something where you get bomboms on top of the screen, and you have to hit

01:24:18.100 --> 01:24:24.420
the potobos to make sure the bomboms don't blow up, which can be a little bit harder

01:24:24.420 --> 01:24:30.500
only because the potobos come pretty quickly, but it wasn't too bad.

01:24:30.500 --> 01:24:37.740
Um, otherwise, what I thought was interesting there is they had a setup for Para Para on...

01:24:37.740 --> 01:24:39.020
What?

01:24:39.020 --> 01:24:46.860
Yes, um, by the DDR machines, but it was off. All I saw was the Para Para controllers, and it just says Para Para on there.

01:24:46.860 --> 01:24:50.900
Like, for PlayStation 2, or for the arcade?

01:24:50.900 --> 01:24:51.900
The console version.

01:24:51.900 --> 01:24:57.940
Why would they bring that here? They've got no plans to release that here, as far as I know. That's weird.

01:24:57.940 --> 01:25:01.680
I don't know, they couldn't release that here. Nobody would get it.

01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:03.540
Nobody would get it.

01:25:03.540 --> 01:25:07.760
There'd be like five people that would buy it, and they're the hardcore Para Para fans. Nobody else would get it.

01:25:07.760 --> 01:25:12.880
It's released, um, US pioneers are releasing Para Para All Stars.

01:25:12.880 --> 01:25:13.380
Really?

01:25:13.380 --> 01:25:16.620
Uh, they just released the, uh, soundtrack.

01:25:16.620 --> 01:25:18.840
Interesting. Hmm. Okay, well,

01:25:18.840 --> 01:25:23.580
maybe there's, I don't know, maybe just some kid brought it from home to let everybody play.

01:25:23.580 --> 01:25:25.100
I don't know, that's weird.

01:25:25.100 --> 01:25:26.400
That is very weird.

01:25:26.400 --> 01:25:29.460
But it wasn't on.

01:25:29.460 --> 01:25:32.780
Anything else you want to share with us?

01:25:32.780 --> 01:25:36.020
Not really. I was fairly impressed with Guitar Hero, though.

01:25:36.020 --> 01:25:39.420
I played one of the

01:25:39.420 --> 01:25:43.180
second easiest kind of songs.

01:25:43.180 --> 01:25:46.680
I mean, it took me a second to learn, but otherwise, it wasn't too bad.

01:25:46.680 --> 01:25:50.220
Yeah, we're getting a lot of good early feedback on that, so it should be a good game.

01:25:50.220 --> 01:25:53.680
Did it feel like Amplitude? Have you played Amplitude and

01:25:53.680 --> 01:25:55.920
frequency, did it feel like those games to you?

01:25:55.920 --> 01:25:59.160
Yeah, actually it was pretty similar to that.

01:25:59.160 --> 01:26:02.840
Same way, same setup and everything.

01:26:02.840 --> 01:26:06.960
Very cool. It's just that with, I don't know, guitar.

01:26:06.960 --> 01:26:08.480
Okay, that works.

01:26:08.480 --> 01:26:12.400
Alright, well we're going to go ahead and let you go so we can get to some other calls, but thanks for calling in, okay?

01:26:12.400 --> 01:26:15.960
Glad to hear you had a good time at the show, even though everything was very crowded and

01:26:15.960 --> 01:26:20.320
you didn't get to play too much, but at least you got to see a lot of cool stuff.

01:26:20.320 --> 01:26:21.320
Yeah, yeah, it wasn't bad.

01:26:21.320 --> 01:26:22.320
Alright.

01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:23.320
Alright.

01:26:23.320 --> 01:26:24.320
Alright, take care.

01:26:24.320 --> 01:26:25.320
Thank you.

01:26:25.320 --> 01:26:26.320
Later.

01:26:26.320 --> 01:26:28.320
Uh, let's go to one more call.

01:26:28.320 --> 01:26:30.320
Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio.

01:26:30.320 --> 01:26:31.320
Hey, hey, hey, it's Ronchon.

01:26:31.320 --> 01:26:32.320
Hi, Ronchon.

01:26:32.320 --> 01:26:33.320
How are you?

01:26:33.320 --> 01:26:34.320
Hi, Ron.

01:26:34.320 --> 01:26:35.320
Hey, what's up, people?

01:26:35.320 --> 01:26:36.320
Hey.

01:26:36.320 --> 01:26:37.320
Hey.

01:26:37.320 --> 01:26:38.320
Hey, you wanna hear a joke?

01:26:38.320 --> 01:26:39.320
Yeah, yeah.

01:26:39.320 --> 01:26:40.320
Okay.

01:26:40.320 --> 01:26:41.320
What do gay horses eat?

01:26:41.320 --> 01:26:42.320
Hey.

01:26:42.320 --> 01:26:43.320
Hey.

01:26:43.320 --> 01:26:44.320
Hey.

01:26:44.320 --> 01:26:45.320
Sorry, anyway.

01:26:45.320 --> 01:26:52.320
The funny thing you've mentioned is that it has something to do with the con I went to this past weekend.

01:26:52.320 --> 01:26:53.320
Oh really?

01:26:53.320 --> 01:26:58.320
Yes, we have what was called Anna Fest, which is like a girl's celebration type convention.

01:26:58.320 --> 01:27:01.320
So, yaoi con without the yaoi?

01:27:01.320 --> 01:27:03.320
Yeah.

01:27:03.320 --> 01:27:07.320
They were actually showing American animation at the con.

01:27:07.320 --> 01:27:11.320
Uh, sounds like total shoujo day.

01:27:11.320 --> 01:27:19.320
There was actually a shoujo-kan, but that, well that's it for another story. But anywho, I was in charge of the masquerade. I had no staffers.

01:27:22.320 --> 01:27:25.320
Okay, so what did you do? What was your responsibility?

01:27:26.320 --> 01:27:28.320
I was in charge of the masquerade and the karaoke.

01:27:28.320 --> 01:27:42.320
The whole weekend I got screamed at by the contract because stuff was not running properly. I was missing stuff. I was missing that. I didn't even know I was missing anything. I didn't even unpack half the stuff that we needed.

01:27:42.320 --> 01:27:51.320
It was just crazy. It was a Saturday, Sunday, Monday convention.

01:27:51.320 --> 01:27:54.320
Why do you have a convention on a Monday? Was Monday a holiday or something?

01:27:54.320 --> 01:28:10.320
I tried to tell them to go Friday, Saturday, Sunday, but they wouldn't want to listen to me. I guess I haven't been to enough cons to know better.

01:28:10.320 --> 01:28:13.320
So what was the highlight of the con?

01:28:13.320 --> 01:28:19.320
The masquerade. Overall, everybody said the con sucked as a whole, but they loved the masquerade.

01:28:19.320 --> 01:28:25.320
Especially the Power of Power skit that was done by my friends. They did Go Godzilla Go.

01:28:25.320 --> 01:28:27.320
Oh, God. What did they do?

01:28:27.320 --> 01:28:38.320
They did the whole Power of Power dance to it. Plus, they had one of our friends with Godzilla in the background, raising their arms back and forth.

01:28:38.320 --> 01:28:43.320
Rancha, I want to go to an anime con with you.

01:28:43.320 --> 01:28:46.320
I'm telling you, fine, in May 2007, I'm shooting for-

01:28:46.320 --> 01:28:49.320
I have an idea for a skit.

01:28:49.320 --> 01:28:50.320
Uh-oh.

01:28:50.320 --> 01:28:59.320
I want to have a bunch of people do Lodos War cross-play, and then do the D&D Satan's Game thing.

01:28:59.320 --> 01:29:03.320
What's the con on the East Coast you're trying to get us to come to next year?

01:29:03.320 --> 01:29:04.320
Katakana.

01:29:04.320 --> 01:29:06.320
Katakana, when's that?

01:29:06.320 --> 01:29:10.820
It's, uh, first or second weekend of February. I have to post information about that in my journal.

01:29:10.820 --> 01:29:11.320
Yeah, definitely.

01:29:11.320 --> 01:29:12.820
You send me a plane ticket, I'll be there.

01:29:12.820 --> 01:29:19.320
I, I may, I may just come because I want to go to the East Coast. Anyway, so I may take some time off to go, so we'll see.

01:29:19.320 --> 01:29:20.820
Give me, definitely give me the details.

01:29:20.820 --> 01:29:23.320
Yeah, I already put you down in my room for the sweep.

01:29:23.320 --> 01:29:24.820
Woo!

01:29:24.820 --> 01:29:26.820
I'll, I'll try to go.

01:29:26.820 --> 01:29:27.820
Sweep.

01:29:27.820 --> 01:29:30.320
And I'll try to bring the bike in costume.

01:29:30.320 --> 01:29:39.320
Nice, because one of my friends, she runs like a giant Guilty Gear cosplay. She has like multiple Kai costumes.

01:29:39.320 --> 01:29:43.320
I don't know shit about anime, which you'll find out at a convention.

01:29:43.320 --> 01:29:45.320
I think that Rob should cosplay fast.

01:29:45.320 --> 01:29:49.320
But I will game geek it up with anybody.

01:29:49.320 --> 01:29:52.320
Rob, we're going to make you a costume. We're going to have you cosplay fast.

01:29:52.320 --> 01:29:55.320
I want to cosplay as a slime from Dragon Quest.

01:29:55.320 --> 01:29:56.320
I want Benimaru.

01:29:56.320 --> 01:29:58.320
No, I don't think... Rob doesn't have...

01:29:58.320 --> 01:30:00.320
I don't have the abs for that.

01:30:00.320 --> 01:30:05.320
But I think that Rob would make a perfect Faust if there's a Guilty Gear cosplay group.

01:30:05.320 --> 01:30:12.320
We should totally imitate the guys who do the same thing at AX every year and have the Shin Sangumi running around.

01:30:12.320 --> 01:30:16.320
See, on the East Coast, we don't have that. We have T-Shirt Ninjas running around.

01:30:16.320 --> 01:30:22.320
T-Shirt Ninjas. Fun. No, no, no, no. We need the Turks this year.

01:30:22.320 --> 01:30:25.880
Well, I will I will definitely be planning on trying to come to that con

01:30:25.880 --> 01:30:29.520
So any of our East Coast listeners, I want them to go to so I can meet everybody at once

01:30:30.200 --> 01:30:31.800
speaking of the Turks

01:30:31.800 --> 01:30:38.800
Capticon we're having a massive Advent Children all group and I am crying about it because I saw all the details for Barrett

01:30:40.560 --> 01:30:42.560
And what happened

01:30:42.960 --> 01:30:49.480
I'm I shit my pants after seeing that gun arm. I'm screaming. I have to make that I have to make that

01:30:49.480 --> 01:30:57.480
You know what? It's entirely possible. Just do the metal arm.

01:30:57.480 --> 01:31:04.480
I think I'll probably stick with the same material I made my original gun arm with, which was PVC.

01:31:04.480 --> 01:31:08.480
For those that don't know where Katsucon is, where is it? Because our chat room is yelling at me.

01:31:08.480 --> 01:31:10.480
It's Washington, D.C.

01:31:10.480 --> 01:31:14.480
This means I have to starve myself for four months if I were to do Tifa.

01:31:14.480 --> 01:31:16.480
I can stand to go to Washington, D.C.

01:31:16.480 --> 01:31:19.480
It's Washington, D.C., the Omni-Shiram Hotel.

01:31:19.480 --> 01:31:20.480
I'll play Marlene.

01:31:20.480 --> 01:31:22.480
All right, I'm saving my money right now.

01:31:22.480 --> 01:31:23.480
Sweet.

01:31:23.480 --> 01:31:24.480
All right.

01:31:24.480 --> 01:31:29.480
And the fact to honor the funniest thing about it, everybody was saying that the con was so gay, and my response was,

01:31:29.480 --> 01:31:32.480
Well, what do you expect? It was run by a bulldog dyke.

01:31:32.480 --> 01:31:34.480
How kind is that?

01:31:34.480 --> 01:31:36.480
I should teach you not.

01:31:36.480 --> 01:31:40.480
People were saying that the con was so gay, and he says, What do you expect? It was run by a bulldog dyke.

01:31:40.480 --> 01:31:48.480
She's running around with this long-ass mullet, and she has the Qui-Gon Jim braid too. I said Star Wars fans would lynch her for that.

01:31:51.480 --> 01:31:53.480
I'll have to find a way there. I will have to find a way.

01:31:53.480 --> 01:31:56.480
Alright, Ron-chan, we gotta let you go, because we got more show to do, but thanks for the-

01:31:56.480 --> 01:32:00.480
I'm gonna start a PayPal collection, send Dark Sakura to the East Coast.

01:32:00.480 --> 01:32:01.480
Alright.

01:32:01.480 --> 01:32:05.480
Oh, Jamie, I have a link to send you later. It's a chart of all the Ron Milhapp soundtracks.

01:32:05.480 --> 01:32:08.480
Ooh! Just email that to me.

01:32:08.480 --> 01:32:09.480
Of course I will.

01:32:09.480 --> 01:32:13.480
Have fun, you anime nerds.

01:32:13.480 --> 01:32:17.480
You shouldn't talk. Bye.

01:32:17.480 --> 01:32:21.480
I shouldn't talk. I'm on the radio talking about video games.

01:32:21.480 --> 01:32:25.480
But to be fair, I also talk about sex.

01:32:25.480 --> 01:32:29.480
That's true. Please shuffle.

01:32:29.480 --> 01:32:35.480
Let's go to a break, kids. We gotta go to a break because when we come back from the break, we're gonna get into the cage match and some other little things.

01:32:35.480 --> 01:32:38.520
I do want to take a couple more Skype calls if we have time. I know there's some more

01:32:38.520 --> 01:32:41.520
people that want to get through, so I want to entertain that, but we have our regular

01:32:41.520 --> 01:32:45.920
segments we definitely have to get through first. So we're going to go to a break, and

01:32:45.920 --> 01:32:51.080
in this break I figure we'll start it off with, how about something from EX2? We haven't

01:32:51.080 --> 01:32:55.240
played some EX2 stuff in a while. Actually, that's probably not true. I know we played

01:32:55.240 --> 01:32:58.280
some last week, but you know, I want to hear some EX2 stuff.

01:32:58.280 --> 01:33:01.920
Just play the music. That's right, we're going to play the music.

01:33:01.920 --> 01:33:04.920
Let's start it off with a little bit of Sneaker Pimps.

01:33:04.920 --> 01:33:06.920
We'll be back after this, kids, with more Orange Launch Radio.

01:33:34.920 --> 01:33:48.860
Spin spin sugar, crawl home to me Spin spin sugar, spin for me

01:33:48.860 --> 01:34:00.820
Spin spin sugar, twist for me Spin spin sugar

01:34:30.820 --> 01:34:46.820
Why don't we just finish it all?

01:36:30.820 --> 01:36:32.820
You

01:37:00.820 --> 01:37:02.820
Oh

01:38:00.820 --> 01:38:04.820
It's right outside of my eyes

01:38:04.820 --> 01:38:07.820
It's not my job

01:38:07.820 --> 01:38:10.820
To pretend this is love

01:38:10.820 --> 01:38:13.820
It's not my duty

01:38:13.820 --> 01:38:17.820
To give me something more

01:38:17.820 --> 01:38:19.820
I'm not alone, I'm not alone

01:40:17.820 --> 01:40:46.500
We are back on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:40:46.500 --> 01:40:52.840

01:41:14.840 --> 01:41:20.520
We need to get the Orange Lounge madam back here because she's great on episode 69 so

01:41:20.520 --> 01:41:21.520
we need to get her back.

01:41:21.520 --> 01:41:22.520
I'm Ms. Tixie Dust.

01:41:22.520 --> 01:41:23.520
All right.

01:41:23.520 --> 01:41:24.520
I'm Ms. Tixie Dust.

01:41:24.520 --> 01:41:25.520
Yep.

01:41:25.520 --> 01:41:26.520
We'll have to get her back here for 169.

01:41:26.520 --> 01:41:27.520
So we'll see what happens.

01:41:27.520 --> 01:41:33.960
I want to talk about this story before we get into the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match.

01:41:33.960 --> 01:41:37.160
Yes, we will get back to the Skyline a little bit later with any time we have left in the

01:41:37.160 --> 01:41:39.940
show at the end because I know there's folks who want to get through, but I have to bring

01:41:39.940 --> 01:41:43.600
this up because this is very interesting and this is DDR related.

01:41:43.600 --> 01:41:51.320
24 Hour Fitness, the really big gym club that you don't go to, they actually made a deal

01:41:51.320 --> 01:41:56.620
with Konami and they're going to be incorporating Dance Dance Revolution arcade machines in

01:41:56.620 --> 01:42:00.280
the kids clubs portion of 24 Hour Fitness.

01:42:00.280 --> 01:42:06.420
In return, Konami is going to put a 30 day pass into the gym in the game.

01:42:06.420 --> 01:42:09.680
So like when you buy a copy of DDR, you're going to get a free 30 day pass for 24 Hour

01:42:09.680 --> 01:42:10.680
Fitness.

01:42:10.680 --> 01:42:14.540
um... let's see uh... konami director of business partnerships

01:42:14.540 --> 01:42:16.040
clara gilbert said

01:42:16.040 --> 01:42:19.020
bringing the health and fitness benefits of the art of twenty four our fitness is

01:42:19.020 --> 01:42:20.480
an unbeatable combination

01:42:20.480 --> 01:42:24.200
and helping kids and adults stay in shape while having fun by placing ddr

01:42:24.200 --> 01:42:25.760
twenty-four fitness locations

01:42:25.760 --> 01:42:28.600
we strive to help kids and adults achieve their fitness goals

01:42:28.600 --> 01:42:30.440
in an unintimidating and fun way

01:42:30.440 --> 01:42:34.280
i didn't know that kids go to twenty four hour fitness i thought that just

01:42:34.280 --> 01:42:37.400
closeted married men go there

01:42:37.400 --> 01:42:41.900
And then they just, they should have fuck fuck resolution, resolution, revolution.

01:42:41.900 --> 01:42:43.400
And then remember dance, dance, fuck.

01:42:43.400 --> 01:42:46.400
It's fun for the whole family, is the idea, Exeterfer.

01:42:46.400 --> 01:42:48.400
Or gay married men.

01:42:51.400 --> 01:42:52.400
I don't think that's...

01:42:52.400 --> 01:42:55.400
Or gay married men.

01:42:55.400 --> 01:42:57.400
They're not going to put this in every 24 hours.

01:42:57.400 --> 01:42:59.400
Gay men can't get married, silly.

01:43:02.400 --> 01:43:02.900
Yes they can.

01:43:02.900 --> 01:43:04.400
The married kind can.

01:43:04.400 --> 01:43:11.400
Anyway, I just kind of want to point out, what do you guys think? Good idea? Bad idea?

01:43:11.400 --> 01:43:14.400
DarkSakura, you're a gym-going member here. What do you think?

01:43:14.400 --> 01:43:16.400
It should go to California Family Fitness.

01:43:16.400 --> 01:43:18.400
California Family Fitness isn't nationwide.

01:43:18.400 --> 01:43:21.400
So, it should go to California Family Fitness.

01:43:21.400 --> 01:43:24.400
Well, they could sign a deal too, maybe. I don't know. Probably not.

01:43:24.400 --> 01:43:26.400
So that I can play DDR at my gym.

01:43:26.400 --> 01:43:29.400
But you can play DDR at home.

01:43:29.400 --> 01:43:32.400
You know, I miss good idea, bad idea.

01:43:32.400 --> 01:43:37.640
okay how's the greatest well is there something you want to say about this

01:43:37.640 --> 01:43:45.240
good idea bad idea wise good idea putting DDR in the gyms bad idea the

01:43:45.240 --> 01:43:50.480
only DTR they're gonna be able to put in the gyms is DDR USA not necessarily no

01:43:50.480 --> 01:43:55.160
the machines they're not over here they're not supposed to be here you know

01:43:55.160 --> 01:43:58.760
you know they'll be extreme deny everything you know maybe they'll make a

01:43:58.760 --> 01:44:04.480
a new DDR? Right. I know, right. But what about that thing that they were testing? Remember

01:44:04.480 --> 01:44:10.120
a while back they were testing something for gyms? True, it was supposed to be like a,

01:44:10.120 --> 01:44:13.000
it had like karate kicks in it and stuff. I don't remember what was in it. It was like

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:16.600
a multi-person DDR thing and I don't think it was for kids, but maybe it's something

01:44:16.600 --> 01:44:23.000
like that. Maybe it's a special DDR. What if the new DDR wasn't for arcades but for

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:27.440
24-hour fitness? Wouldn't that be hilarious? We need Para Para in the gym because that's

01:44:27.440 --> 01:44:29.440
That's a better workout, I think.

01:44:29.440 --> 01:44:39.880
I'm telling you, fuck, fuck Revolution, and it's going to be in the showers, and all the

01:44:39.880 --> 01:44:42.640
closeted gay guys are going to be all on that.

01:44:42.640 --> 01:44:43.640
Drop the soap, Revolution.

01:44:43.640 --> 01:44:46.120
They're going to be all on that.

01:44:46.120 --> 01:44:47.120
Thank you for sharing, Extrovert.

01:44:47.120 --> 01:44:48.120
Oh, no problem.

01:44:48.120 --> 01:44:51.120
That's what it was called, DDR Studio.

01:44:51.120 --> 01:44:54.440
Somebody mentioned that.

01:44:54.440 --> 01:44:58.440
take one of the playstation 2 games and just put it in the cabinet what if they just did that what

01:44:58.440 --> 01:45:05.880
do you think of that loki huh crap crap what if it was extreme 2 extreme 2 is pretty cool

01:45:08.200 --> 01:45:14.520
it would work why not it has to do any build they could how easily would it be deported

01:45:15.480 --> 01:45:20.040
extremely why don't they do it then they could do it lazy you might do it i still stand by

01:45:20.040 --> 01:45:23.960
pada pada in the gym aren't they gonna have to edit the game somehow to put like the 24 hour

01:45:23.960 --> 01:45:28.680
fitness logo in it possibly so while they're at it they can change all the

01:45:28.680 --> 01:45:32.040
songs and stuff I guess I bet you this will be some type of special machine

01:45:32.040 --> 01:45:36.560
just you wait no I want to ask you something real quick Loki because this

01:45:36.560 --> 01:45:39.600
is on another subject something that's been going around on the DDR forums

01:45:39.600 --> 01:45:43.480
what's the last you've heard on a release date for Ultramix 3 because some

01:45:43.480 --> 01:45:47.240
people are saying it's been bumped back from the second it would never was on

01:45:47.240 --> 01:45:50.680
the second oh I don't know you posted some news article on the website said it

01:45:50.680 --> 01:45:56.560
was on a second. That was a while ago. No, it's like on the, I want to say it's the second week, I think.

01:45:56.560 --> 01:46:01.520
Not like a push back a week. I mean, I can't remember if it was the second or

01:46:01.520 --> 01:46:04.320
third week. Everything's in the third week. I mean, there's like 100 games

01:46:04.320 --> 01:46:09.840
coming out in the third week. It's just retarded. But, yeah, if anything, I got

01:46:09.840 --> 01:46:14.160
pushed back only a week or two. And it was, I think, relatively around the same

01:46:14.160 --> 01:46:17.280
amount. I think some folks are saying the 16th now, like two weeks later. It would

01:46:17.280 --> 01:46:22.280
That makes sense. Everything's coming out on the 16th. Everything. I mean, just too many games.

01:46:22.280 --> 01:46:29.280
I can confirm that because of the tournament that we're working on that I have had no time to work on.

01:46:29.280 --> 01:46:34.280
Okay. Very interesting. I just wanted to clear that up because I know it was on some web forums and I was like,

01:46:34.280 --> 01:46:37.280
well, Loki did say that like five months ago, so it might be different now.

01:46:37.280 --> 01:46:40.280
It was a while ago. Of course they're going to move the date around.

01:46:40.280 --> 01:46:45.280
I haven't updated on every single thing I hear about, you know, so.

01:46:45.280 --> 01:46:48.920
you might want to post a little update to our thing. Well, I don't want to, like, update

01:46:48.920 --> 01:46:52.640
it. Okay, yeah, now it's coming out this day. For all those people waiting for Advent Children

01:46:52.640 --> 01:47:03.720
at the end of January now, so. Yeah. All right. Let's go to the cage match. You guys ready

01:47:03.720 --> 01:47:10.840
for this? Yeah, because I actually kept my promise. Goody, goody, goody. I'm so excited.

01:47:10.840 --> 01:47:17.840
Okay, in the meantime, while I'm setting up CAGEMATCH, Dark Soccer, why don't you plug some of the other great programming we have here on Orange Launch Radio.

01:47:17.840 --> 01:47:20.840
You mean Pump of the Volume, which is every other week?

01:47:20.840 --> 01:47:21.840
Yes.

01:47:21.840 --> 01:47:31.840
This is me on Tuesdays, Pump of the Volume, where I play whatever I really want to play and request if people actually decide to request them for a change.

01:47:31.840 --> 01:47:33.840
I usually end up playing lots of Blur.

01:47:33.840 --> 01:47:41.840
Last week, I did the Danger Doom CD, which I actually had for our pre-show today.

01:47:41.840 --> 01:47:45.840
And coming up, we have Extra First Case of the Mondays.

01:47:45.840 --> 01:47:49.840
And aren't we supposed to do a fuck-off show?

01:47:49.840 --> 01:47:52.840
Like, weren't we supposed to do that? But it was too late.

01:47:52.840 --> 01:47:53.840
We need to do a fuck-off show.

01:47:53.840 --> 01:47:56.840
Yeah, that would be really cool. What is the fuck-off show?

01:47:56.840 --> 01:48:00.840
That's when we get really bored and just randomly do shows.

01:48:00.840 --> 01:48:02.840
Come off the air and just fuck off.

01:48:02.840 --> 01:48:06.840
I want a fuck on show.

01:48:06.840 --> 01:48:10.840
Fuck on, fuck off, the fucker.

01:48:10.840 --> 01:48:12.840
Alright, you guys ready for tonight's Cage Match?

01:48:12.840 --> 01:48:14.840
Oh, I don't know Rob Roberts, are we?

01:48:14.840 --> 01:48:15.840
I think we are.

01:48:15.840 --> 01:48:16.840
Okay.

01:48:16.840 --> 01:48:20.840
The way the Cage Match works, we're going to play three songs for you guys.

01:48:20.840 --> 01:48:23.840
Last week's winner and two brand new songs, as chosen by our hosts.

01:48:23.840 --> 01:48:25.840
And you're going to vote for your favorite.

01:48:25.840 --> 01:48:29.840
And the winning song goes into rotation all week long here on Orange Lounge Radio's

01:48:29.840 --> 01:48:59.660
The song is called Hold Your Color by Pendulum and it's song number 1 tonight.

01:48:59.660 --> 01:49:22.980
And we're gonna roll back thekun flirtatious Kristin

01:49:22.980 --> 01:49:24.980
Don't give up

01:49:24.980 --> 01:49:29.980
Don't you curse against the law

01:49:29.980 --> 01:49:35.980
When they take everything away

01:49:35.980 --> 01:49:43.980
Don't you curse against the law

01:49:43.980 --> 01:50:10.980
I keep looking into your eyes

01:50:10.980 --> 01:50:13.980
And so I lay beneath

01:50:13.980 --> 01:50:16.980
Don't try to save yourself

01:50:16.980 --> 01:50:19.980
The circle is gonna reach

01:50:19.980 --> 01:50:23.980
Reaching out as you dig

01:50:23.980 --> 01:50:28.980
Nothing else can touch me

01:50:28.980 --> 01:50:31.980
So can I

01:50:31.980 --> 01:50:35.980
Two guns against the wall

01:50:35.980 --> 01:50:41.980
And they take everything away

01:50:41.980 --> 01:50:47.980
Come with your colors, you can't do it

01:51:11.980 --> 01:51:18.980
We have, also from the Hold Your Color album by Pendulum, track 2, which is, um, or actually,

01:51:18.980 --> 01:51:21.980
take that back, make it track 9 out here.

01:51:21.980 --> 01:51:23.980
Oh, god damn you, you can't change on me.

01:51:23.980 --> 01:51:24.980
Yes I can.

01:51:24.980 --> 01:51:26.980
Fine, track 9.

01:51:26.980 --> 01:51:27.980
Alright.

01:51:27.980 --> 01:51:29.980
Can you do this?

01:51:29.980 --> 01:51:33.980
Is this legal in the, in the, um, Cagematch rulebook?

01:51:33.980 --> 01:51:34.980
The bylaws?

01:51:34.980 --> 01:51:36.980
That you can put in a song by the same artist?

01:51:36.980 --> 01:51:38.980
I protest vehemently.

01:51:38.980 --> 01:51:40.980
Just to spite the person who won?

01:51:40.980 --> 01:51:52.940
I hate you alright so it's out here song number two in tonight's cage match pendulum

01:51:52.940 --> 01:51:59.940
without here. Enjoy it.

01:53:22.940 --> 01:53:31.940
Turn down the volume

01:53:31.940 --> 01:53:41.940
Turn down the volume

01:53:41.940 --> 01:53:51.940
Turn down the volume

01:53:51.940 --> 01:53:56.940
And I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't

01:54:21.940 --> 01:54:39.940
Yeah, I'm down to one

01:54:39.940 --> 01:54:49.940
Yeah, I'm down to one

01:56:19.940 --> 01:56:47.940
Tear it down, whoa Tear it down, whoa

01:57:47.940 --> 01:58:11.780
Song number two tonight, Pendulum with Out Here was the name of that song, let's go around

01:58:11.780 --> 01:58:16.060
and see what everybody thought of song number two, which by the way was the same artist

01:58:16.060 --> 01:58:18.460
The song number one, you bastard.

01:58:18.460 --> 01:58:21.160
Star Chakra.

01:58:21.160 --> 01:58:25.880
Um, I really liked it, but it made me think of music from Tekken 5 and Tekken 4.

01:58:25.880 --> 01:58:30.700
Um, I really liked that game, but it's just...

01:58:30.700 --> 01:58:35.080
You know, it was really, it was good, but it seemed very long. I mean, as...

01:58:35.080 --> 01:58:37.200
I really like it a lot.

01:58:37.200 --> 01:58:44.200
But there's something that bugs me about it that I can't really put my finger on. I think it's a 9. It's pretty good.

01:58:44.200 --> 01:58:53.200
It was really cool. I like the album, because I acquired it after listening to the song on last week's episode.

01:58:53.200 --> 01:58:56.200
So yeah, it gives a 9.

01:58:56.200 --> 01:59:01.200
By the way, totally off topic, and I just remembered this when she was talking about puppies.

01:59:01.200 --> 01:59:06.200
I was walking through King's Beach, and they had a store called Dog Baker.

01:59:06.200 --> 01:59:10.200
And I thought, Amal, do they bake dogs there? I'm like, that's pretty wrong.

01:59:10.200 --> 01:59:15.200
No, I know what that place is. They make, um, dog biscuits.

01:59:15.200 --> 01:59:16.200
They cook puppies.

01:59:16.200 --> 01:59:17.200
Extrovert.

01:59:17.200 --> 01:59:25.200
Uh, 10. That song was music to fuck to. I really, really enjoyed that song. It was a good sex song.

01:59:25.200 --> 01:59:29.200
Um, and, uh, you know, Shane has good taste in music.

01:59:29.200 --> 01:59:31.200
Don't, God, don't inflate his ego. God, don't.

01:59:31.200 --> 01:59:38.200
No, no, no, no, no. I'm just going to say, he's serving as an inspiration behind the first song that I'm going to play on my show.

01:59:38.200 --> 01:59:42.680
extra first case of the mondays airing a week from tomorrow

01:59:42.680 --> 01:59:46.160
my thoughts on the song my song was better it really was that was too slow

01:59:46.160 --> 01:59:50.080
and mellow and you should vote for mine instead because that one was too

01:59:50.080 --> 01:59:53.080
i would have thought it was but i want to sleep

01:59:53.080 --> 01:59:54.840
i agree your song was better

01:59:54.840 --> 01:59:57.960
so the the thing is that i had to put a song in now

01:59:57.960 --> 02:00:01.080
so that i can make the final final modifications for the song actually

02:00:01.080 --> 02:00:03.440
i give that song uh... uh...

02:00:03.440 --> 02:00:05.160
too

02:00:05.160 --> 02:00:07.640
for the number of pendulum songs we have in cage match night

02:00:07.640 --> 02:00:09.140
And because mine was better.

02:00:09.140 --> 02:00:13.080
Come on Jimmy, put in your pendulum song. Angel, your thoughts.

02:00:13.080 --> 02:00:14.360
Your, your rating.

02:00:14.360 --> 02:00:16.520
There we go, um...

02:00:16.520 --> 02:00:19.800
I don't know, I'll give it a ten, just cause it's, uh...

02:00:19.800 --> 02:00:23.000
I like it, I like it a lot. Uh...

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:26.680
I was gonna say, good music to, like...

02:00:26.680 --> 02:00:31.640
Have sex too? No, good music to, um...

02:00:31.640 --> 02:00:35.820
Have sex too? No, no, no. Digitally P2? Paint.

02:00:35.820 --> 02:00:38.820
I hate you sick people!

02:00:40.820 --> 02:00:41.820
Oh!

02:00:41.820 --> 02:00:42.820
Alright, let's move on.

02:00:42.820 --> 02:00:44.820
I don't know about your water sports angel, but...

02:00:44.820 --> 02:00:45.820
Dark sacram!

02:00:45.820 --> 02:00:46.820
Jesus.

02:00:46.820 --> 02:00:48.820
What do you have for us tonight?

02:00:48.820 --> 02:00:50.820
Did you make good on your threads?

02:00:50.820 --> 02:00:54.820
I said I was going to put ABBA in, but I forgot that I can't find my copy of ABBA Gold.

02:00:54.820 --> 02:00:57.820
So I put an ABBA cover in.

02:00:57.820 --> 02:00:59.820
So this is a...

02:00:59.820 --> 02:01:03.820
And I don't know if this is the 18th because it said it was the 18th.

02:01:03.820 --> 02:01:04.820
Yes, it's the 18th.

02:01:04.820 --> 02:01:07.820
is the Erotic remix of SOS.

02:01:07.820 --> 02:01:11.820
Which I have a feeling is a false labeling because I do not know of any time Erotic actually

02:01:11.820 --> 02:01:12.820
mixed the songs.

02:01:12.820 --> 02:01:15.220
This could actually just be the Erotic version for all we know.

02:01:15.220 --> 02:01:19.020
It could be, but that's how I've had it for years and I've never knew the difference.

02:01:19.020 --> 02:01:23.220
So some type of remix of SOS by ABBA, one way or another.

02:01:23.220 --> 02:01:26.220
Yeah, I said I would put in ABBA, this is something ABBA.

02:01:26.220 --> 02:01:27.220
Alright.

02:01:27.220 --> 02:01:28.220
Here it is.

02:01:28.220 --> 02:01:28.720
Enjoy!

02:01:58.220 --> 02:02:03.220
To our love, I wish I understood

02:02:04.220 --> 02:02:08.220
It used to be so nice, it used to be so good

02:02:11.220 --> 02:02:16.220
So when you need a new darling, can't you hear me? S.O.S.

02:02:19.220 --> 02:02:24.220
The love you gave me, nothing left to save me, S.O.S.

02:02:24.220 --> 02:02:31.220
When you go, when you go, how can I even try to go?

02:02:31.220 --> 02:02:39.220
When you go, when you go, oh I try, how can I carry on?

02:02:39.220 --> 02:02:47.220
I've been so far away that we were standing here

02:02:47.220 --> 02:02:53.220
You make me feel alive, that's something that I see

02:02:53.220 --> 02:03:01.220
I really tried to make it out, I wish I understood

02:03:01.220 --> 02:03:08.220
What happened to my love, it used to be so good

02:03:08.220 --> 02:03:16.220
But when you're near me darling, can't you hear me? S.O.S.

02:03:16.220 --> 02:03:21.220
The love you gave me, nothing else to save me, ask for it

02:03:23.220 --> 02:03:28.220
When you're gone, when you're gone, how can I even try to know why

02:03:28.220 --> 02:03:37.220
When you go, when you go, go and try How can I carry on, carry on?

02:03:37.220 --> 02:03:56.220
Oh when you near me darling, can't you hear me, S.O.S.

02:03:56.220 --> 02:04:04.220
And love you gave me nothing else to save me, S.O.S.

02:04:04.220 --> 02:04:11.220
when you come, when you come, how can I even try to go on?

02:04:11.220 --> 02:04:19.220
when you come, when you come, go and try, how can I carry on?

02:04:19.220 --> 02:04:26.220
When you come, when you come, how can I even try to go on, go on?

02:04:26.220 --> 02:04:27.220
I'm on my way

02:04:27.220 --> 02:04:28.220
When you done

02:04:28.220 --> 02:04:29.220
When you done

02:04:29.220 --> 02:04:30.220
When you done

02:04:30.220 --> 02:04:31.220
You're a drown

02:04:31.220 --> 02:04:32.220
How can I

02:04:32.220 --> 02:04:33.220
Carry on

02:04:33.220 --> 02:04:34.220
Carry on

02:04:34.220 --> 02:04:35.220
When you done

02:04:35.220 --> 02:04:36.220
When you done

02:04:36.220 --> 02:04:37.220
When you done

02:04:37.220 --> 02:04:38.220
You're a drown

02:04:38.220 --> 02:04:39.220
How can I

02:04:39.220 --> 02:04:40.220
Carry on

02:04:40.220 --> 02:04:41.220
Carry on

02:04:41.220 --> 02:04:52.120
All right that was song number three in tonight's Cage Mash, the 18th...

02:04:52.120 --> 02:04:53.120
Oh crap!

02:04:53.120 --> 02:04:55.840
Damn just like totally crashed on me.

02:04:55.840 --> 02:04:57.760
That was weird.

02:04:57.760 --> 02:04:58.800
Wow.

02:04:58.800 --> 02:05:00.960
Dead air.

02:05:00.960 --> 02:05:01.680
That's not good.

02:05:01.680 --> 02:05:03.760
Shit.

02:05:03.760 --> 02:05:06.320
OK, well let's go around and see what everybody thought of,

02:05:06.320 --> 02:05:08.040
we'll just have to not have background music right now.

02:05:08.040 --> 02:05:10.120
Or maybe you can have explosive diarrhea.

02:05:10.120 --> 02:05:11.320
Yeah, let's do that.

02:05:11.320 --> 02:05:11.880
Let's do that.

02:05:11.880 --> 02:05:12.600
Since you said shit.

02:05:12.600 --> 02:05:13.360
Ass.

02:05:13.360 --> 02:05:14.680
All right, let's go around and see what everybody thought

02:05:14.680 --> 02:05:15.800
of that song.

02:05:15.800 --> 02:05:21.280
Song number three, 18s with SOS starting off with Dark Sakura.

02:05:21.280 --> 02:05:23.040
I need help.

02:05:23.040 --> 02:05:24.800
SOS.

02:05:24.800 --> 02:05:25.480
OK.

02:05:25.480 --> 02:05:30.000
Um, I actually like that song, um, so it gets an 8.

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:30.920
Okay.

02:05:30.920 --> 02:05:32.160
Loki.

02:05:32.160 --> 02:05:34.280
I didn't like it.

02:05:34.280 --> 02:05:37.520
It's just not for me. It's too...

02:05:37.520 --> 02:05:38.880
I don't know.

02:05:38.880 --> 02:05:41.800
Too happy.

02:05:41.800 --> 02:05:43.640
Too gay. Yes, it's too

02:05:43.640 --> 02:05:44.800
gay. It's too

02:05:44.800 --> 02:05:46.520
flaming gay.

02:05:46.520 --> 02:05:49.440
That's why I don't like the song.

02:05:49.440 --> 02:05:52.440
Let's check on and see what DDRUK has to say about

02:05:52.440 --> 02:06:14.440
In today's news, people smoked crack.

02:06:22.440 --> 02:06:29.440
Well, you guys need to go find... I got nothing. I'm tallying Caged Bash votes. You guys need to figure out how to... I got nothing, but no. No, really.

02:06:29.440 --> 02:06:39.440
As far as official Sim files go, still working on the official stuff. Looks like to me, though, that they're probably not done.

02:06:39.440 --> 02:06:52.440
Okay, what Sakurino wanted to share is that the VJ Army forums are starting their own collection of StepMania sim files for Happy Sky. The whole community. That's the big news.

02:06:52.440 --> 02:07:04.440
Wow. Okay. There you have it. Hooray! More StepFiles for BeatMania songs. Just what we needed. We don't have any of those. We've never had those before.

02:07:04.440 --> 02:07:06.440
Let's beat Mania.

02:07:08.440 --> 02:07:10.440
Beat Mania 2DX, whatever you want to call it.

02:07:10.440 --> 02:07:14.440
Is that when you turn into a maniac and beat someone?

02:07:14.440 --> 02:07:15.440
Yes.

02:07:15.440 --> 02:07:18.440
Oh, wait, did you want me to say Hip Hop Mania?

02:07:18.440 --> 02:07:21.440
Everybody loves the Hip Hop Mania.

02:07:21.440 --> 02:07:24.440
I remember that thing.

02:07:24.440 --> 02:07:26.440
Hip Hop Mania rocks.

02:07:26.440 --> 02:07:28.440
Yo.

02:07:28.440 --> 02:07:30.440
We're going to go to a break.

02:07:30.440 --> 02:07:33.440
When we come back for the break, we're going to announce tonight's Cagemash winner.

02:07:33.440 --> 02:07:37.000
and we're gonna get into the FUs of the week because I know you kids are

02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:40.560
angsty and extra for once to give a movie review although I didn't think he

02:07:40.560 --> 02:07:42.160
saw anything this week so I'm

02:07:42.160 --> 02:07:46.480
I'm going to be a little bit surprised surely

02:07:46.480 --> 02:07:49.440
alright so we'll be back after this we're gonna start off with a little bit

02:07:49.440 --> 02:07:50.760
of a

02:07:50.760 --> 02:07:54.240
I think we'll start off with some Daikonkai how's that sound

02:07:54.240 --> 02:08:01.240
We'll be back after this.

02:08:24.240 --> 02:08:25.240
4

02:08:25.240 --> 02:08:26.240
2

02:08:26.240 --> 02:08:27.240
3

02:08:27.240 --> 02:08:28.240
4

02:08:28.240 --> 02:08:29.240
5

02:08:29.240 --> 02:08:30.240
6

02:08:30.240 --> 02:08:31.240
7

02:08:31.240 --> 02:08:32.240
8

02:08:32.240 --> 02:08:33.240
9

02:08:33.240 --> 02:08:34.240
10

02:08:34.240 --> 02:08:35.240
11

02:08:35.240 --> 02:08:36.240
12

02:08:36.240 --> 02:08:37.240
13

02:08:37.240 --> 02:08:38.240
14

02:08:38.240 --> 02:08:39.240
15

02:08:39.240 --> 02:08:40.240
16

02:08:40.240 --> 02:08:41.240
17

02:08:41.240 --> 02:08:42.240
18

02:08:42.240 --> 02:08:43.240
19

02:08:43.240 --> 02:08:44.240
20

02:08:44.240 --> 02:08:45.240
21

02:08:45.240 --> 02:08:46.240
22

02:08:46.240 --> 02:08:47.240
23

02:08:47.240 --> 02:08:48.240
24

02:08:48.240 --> 02:08:49.240
25

02:08:49.240 --> 02:08:50.240
26

02:08:50.240 --> 02:08:51.240
27

02:08:51.240 --> 02:08:52.240
28

02:08:52.240 --> 02:08:53.240
29

02:08:53.240 --> 02:08:55.240
Yeah

02:10:23.240 --> 02:10:27.240
And I can't go back

02:10:27.240 --> 02:10:30.240
I never remember

02:10:30.240 --> 02:10:33.240
You showed me like that

02:10:33.240 --> 02:10:37.240
And I'll play me by your brain

02:10:37.240 --> 02:10:39.240
And I

02:10:39.240 --> 02:10:44.240
Shine tonight

02:11:14.240 --> 02:11:16.240
You're not the same girl you got me on

02:11:16.240 --> 02:11:19.240
You're the same girl

02:11:19.240 --> 02:11:22.240
I'm never like the one I want

02:11:23.240 --> 02:11:25.240
You will show me what you're worth

02:11:25.240 --> 02:11:27.240
I ain't the one

02:11:27.240 --> 02:11:29.240
Lend me my own way

02:14:59.240 --> 02:15:23.560
Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.

02:15:23.560 --> 02:15:26.560
Do you want to be accepted by Hollywood?

02:15:26.560 --> 02:15:27.560
No!

02:15:27.560 --> 02:15:29.560
Do we care what people think of us?

02:15:29.560 --> 02:15:31.560
No!

02:15:31.560 --> 02:15:33.560
Do we want people to kiss our ass?

02:15:33.560 --> 02:15:35.560
Yeah!

02:15:37.560 --> 02:15:42.560
Extreme Bobbani Radio. That's us. Orange Lounge Radio.

02:15:42.560 --> 02:15:44.560
You know, that movie was on TV today.

02:15:44.560 --> 02:15:48.560
Well, it sounds awfully a lot like Jamie there in the promo.

02:15:48.560 --> 02:15:50.560
Do we want people to kiss our ass?

02:15:51.560 --> 02:15:53.560
Yes!

02:15:53.560 --> 02:15:56.560
Absolutely. We love it when people kiss our ass.

02:15:56.560 --> 02:16:13.560
You can kiss our ass by voting us A5 on your player window or voting us on Podcast Alley because no one else did this month. That makes me sad, people.

02:16:13.560 --> 02:16:14.560
Kiss our ass.

02:16:14.560 --> 02:16:16.560
Shut the fuck up.

02:16:16.560 --> 02:16:18.560
That is the gayest I've ever heard you say.

02:16:18.560 --> 02:16:21.560
I can really do gay really well.

02:16:21.560 --> 02:16:25.560
Rob Roberts, tell us what's next.

02:16:25.560 --> 02:16:27.560
You should talk like that always.

02:16:27.560 --> 02:16:30.560
No, I'd kill you. I really would. I would just take you out back and shoot you.

02:16:30.560 --> 02:16:33.560
If you start going super, then I'm going to cry.

02:16:33.560 --> 02:16:35.560
Can you imagine every morning?

02:16:35.560 --> 02:16:38.560
Good morning!

02:16:38.560 --> 02:16:40.560
There's too many gay jokes on tonight's show.

02:16:40.560 --> 02:16:42.560
Hello, Rob!

02:16:42.560 --> 02:16:44.560
We need to tone it down.

02:16:44.560 --> 02:16:46.560
Oh, okay, dude.

02:16:46.560 --> 02:16:48.560
There you go. That's better.

02:16:48.560 --> 02:16:50.560
Do we need a gay promo?

02:16:50.560 --> 02:16:52.560
No we don't. Yes we do.

02:16:52.560 --> 02:16:54.560
Listen to Orange Lounge.

02:16:54.560 --> 02:16:56.560
I guess this show is only going to get gayer

02:16:56.560 --> 02:16:58.560
because we are going to allow Ex-Defer

02:16:58.560 --> 02:17:00.560
to do his movie review!

02:17:00.560 --> 02:17:02.560
Don't play the music.

02:17:06.560 --> 02:17:08.560
I just, I don't know.

02:17:08.560 --> 02:17:10.560
I don't know about that.

02:17:10.560 --> 02:17:12.560
Alright, what did you see this week?

02:17:12.560 --> 02:17:14.560
Well, I didn't see it this week, but I just thought

02:17:14.560 --> 02:17:22.480
I mean, it was kind of like a spur-of-the-moment idea that I would review Deep Impact, because

02:17:22.480 --> 02:17:31.300
Gene Shalit of Today called it a thriller with brains, and Jeffrey Lyons of NBC TV said

02:17:31.300 --> 02:17:36.680
it was exhilarating the special effects highlight of the year, which really nobody saw Deep

02:17:36.680 --> 02:17:39.480
Impact because they all saw that other one.

02:17:39.480 --> 02:17:41.160
I saw Deep Impact in the theater.

02:17:41.160 --> 02:17:42.160
I did too.

02:17:42.160 --> 02:17:49.160
Actually I liked it better than the other one, I was going to say Asteroid, but that was the one on TV.

02:17:49.160 --> 02:17:55.160
I liked Deep Impact because Téa Leoni died in it, and sorry to ruin it for you, but she died in it and I hate her.

02:17:55.160 --> 02:18:04.160
Dances are doing one about hurricanes called category 7. I'm like, that's insulting.

02:18:04.160 --> 02:18:07.160
So what do you think of it?

02:18:07.160 --> 02:18:17.160
I think it was a good movie. I think it was kind of, you know, cheesy or whatever, but I thought it had a little bit more drama in it than the other movie, Armageddon.

02:18:17.160 --> 02:18:18.160
Drama?

02:18:18.160 --> 02:18:22.160
Yeah, drama. It had some drama in it and we all loved it.

02:18:22.160 --> 02:18:24.160
We all ate it up.

02:18:24.160 --> 02:18:32.160
No, but it was really good. I think there should be a porn called Deep Impact and if there hasn't been yet, I think they should make one.

02:18:32.160 --> 02:18:37.980
because then it would be like about a giant cock headed towards some

02:18:37.980 --> 02:18:42.120
unsuspecting guy's anus and then you know he can't escape it and there's

02:18:42.120 --> 02:18:49.920
going to be a white wave at the end of the movie what do you think Rob I think

02:18:49.920 --> 02:18:53.820
it's a I think it's a seller you're an asshole you know people make it's a

02:18:53.820 --> 02:18:58.840
billion-dollar industry the porn business and I mean a lot of people buy

02:18:58.840 --> 02:19:05.760

Alright, let's see tonight's winner of the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match.

02:20:02.440 --> 02:20:04.440
Speaking of which, it's a little late to have your plug in there,

02:20:04.440 --> 02:20:06.440
because we already have a winner for tonight's cage match.

02:20:06.440 --> 02:20:08.440

Pendulum Hold Your Color wins song number one.

02:20:28.440 --> 02:20:29.440
Loki?

02:20:29.440 --> 02:20:30.440
Suck it, Loki.

02:20:30.440 --> 02:20:31.440
I mean, I could take him.

02:20:31.440 --> 02:20:32.440
I could take Rob.

02:20:32.440 --> 02:20:33.440
Suck it!

02:20:33.440 --> 02:20:35.440
More ABBA next week!

02:20:35.440 --> 02:20:37.440
More Pendulum next week.

02:20:37.440 --> 02:20:38.440
Great.

02:20:38.440 --> 02:20:41.440
Yeah, I'll have to counteract that with Echo Image.

02:20:41.440 --> 02:20:44.440
We've already put in all the Echo Image songs.

02:20:44.440 --> 02:20:47.440
Have we put in the entire Echo Image CD at some point here?

02:20:47.440 --> 02:20:51.940
And then, what's the other one that I could bring up? I'll bring Vincent to more.

02:20:51.940 --> 02:20:55.440
I'll combat you with info.

02:20:55.440 --> 02:20:59.940
Or like, Cybertrans or something, CyberX.

02:20:59.940 --> 02:21:02.940
On that note, let's get into tonight's FUs of the Week, shall we?

02:21:02.940 --> 02:21:05.940
DarkSakura, why is it that we do the FUs of the Week every single week?

02:21:05.940 --> 02:21:09.440
Oh, by the way, kids, you can send in your FUs to me right now, but keep them short!

02:21:09.440 --> 02:21:11.440
Why is it we do the F.U.'s of the Week every single week?

02:21:21.440 --> 02:21:27.440
F.U. to old people who think that they have perfect night vision and can drive.

02:21:28.440 --> 02:21:31.440
No, you really can't, you suck.

02:21:31.440 --> 02:21:43.440
Um, ugh. I just, I'm good at being busy and F you to my medication that I can't really go into too much detail about on the air.

02:21:43.440 --> 02:21:48.440
Um, F you to hormones. I'm done.

02:21:48.440 --> 02:21:51.440
Let's get to Loki's F yous.

02:21:51.440 --> 02:22:15.440
My FUs first begins with the Hyatt at Lake Tahoe. Fuck you to their service because it sucks. First they gave me the wrong room with the wrong bed in it. Then they tried to charge me $3 for something that was supposedly taken out of the mini bar, despite the fact that they never gave me the key for the mini bar and it was zip tied shut. So that would have been some magic.

02:22:15.440 --> 02:22:37.440
Um, anyways, um, also fuck you to having to, you know, make the two hour drive to Lake Tahoe, I was actually driving around on the weekend and there's these stupid people in SUVs trying to tailgate me, um, along these roads that are really windy and stuff, and the speed limit's only 45 anyways, and the guy is driving down the center line, cause he's trying to pass me on double yellow.

02:22:37.440 --> 02:22:47.440
So fuck you to the... fucking SUV drivers. At least though, they're in Tahoe where there are actual hills and snow, so SUVs are allowed there, but... yeah, they still suck.

02:22:48.440 --> 02:22:57.440
And finally, um, just fuck you to the fact that I was actually bored enough to bid on some item on eBay for god knows how much money,

02:22:57.440 --> 02:23:10.440
And now I have this stupid poster that may be autographed by the entire cast of True Crime's New York, but now I have this thing that I had paid way too much money for, and it sucks.

02:23:10.440 --> 02:23:20.440
But at least it went to charity, so I guess that's okay, but still too much money spent this weekend, and fuck you, they'll hide it again for having their slots being way too damn tight.

02:23:20.440 --> 02:23:23.440
It's just like playing in any casino, so fuck them.

02:23:23.440 --> 02:23:52.440
I'm actually really not that angsty, all things considered. I am really angsty at one situation right now, but I can't talk about it on air, but it's something related to something I can't go to, that I wanted to go to, and now I can't go to it, and that makes me upset, because I don't like it when I don't get my way. So, F you to me not getting my way.

02:23:52.440 --> 02:23:58.440
And an F.U. to traffic on Watt Avenue the other day because it was stupid.

02:23:58.440 --> 02:24:04.440
And an F.U. to candy corn because it's really addicting, but you know what's even more addicting than candy corn?

02:24:04.440 --> 02:24:07.440
Is that Indian corn, the one that tastes like chocolate.

02:24:07.440 --> 02:24:11.440
Shit is so good. I'm telling you, that shit is so good.

02:24:11.440 --> 02:24:14.440
Just don't eat candy.

02:24:14.440 --> 02:24:16.440
I can't do that.

02:24:16.440 --> 02:24:18.440
They make sugar-free candy corn, by the way.

02:24:18.440 --> 02:24:20.440
Ooh, maybe now that, maybe I could do it.

02:24:20.440 --> 02:24:22.440
But it makes you take a shit really bad if you eat too much of it.

02:24:22.440 --> 02:24:23.440
At least I'd lose weight.

02:24:26.440 --> 02:24:27.440
That's it.

02:24:27.440 --> 02:24:30.440
Uh, Xtapher, let's get to your FUs tonight.

02:24:31.440 --> 02:24:37.440
Uh, FU, fuck you to me, because I keep talking about sex, I need to get laid.

02:24:38.440 --> 02:24:41.440
And I, I, I'm just talking about it way too much.

02:24:41.440 --> 02:24:45.440
Um, so, yeah, fuck, fuck you to me, hopefully soon.

02:24:45.440 --> 02:24:51.200
Um, and, yeah, I think that's pretty much it.

02:24:51.200 --> 02:24:59.040
And I know there was something I was thinking about, and I can't remember it, so on to Angel.

02:24:59.040 --> 02:25:00.720
Angel.

02:25:00.720 --> 02:25:12.200
I've been to my computer, um, deciding to kill itself during a Scarlet Monastery run, which, uh, I don't know if you guys have all gotten that high or not, but, um,

02:25:12.200 --> 02:25:20.940
Yet that wasn't cool when it did that because I had other stuff to do this weekend after

02:25:20.940 --> 02:25:27.180
I was playing World of Warcraft so luckily it died after my portfolio was due for school

02:25:27.180 --> 02:25:33.420
so that's a good thing but it still sucks I don't have a PC right now.

02:25:33.420 --> 02:25:40.420
Other than that, all is well, I believe, so that's it for me.

02:26:03.420 --> 02:26:10.460
Ron Chan would like to say an FU to Cablevision for coming to an install to replace a cable

02:26:10.460 --> 02:26:11.460
modem.

02:26:11.460 --> 02:26:12.540
Something that I could have done myself.

02:26:12.540 --> 02:26:15.380
I didn't need to be up at 8am for this.

02:26:15.380 --> 02:26:19.800
Nintendo Maniac 64 says FU to myself for not even touching my homework yet and it's like

02:26:19.800 --> 02:26:21.460
midnight here on the east coast.

02:26:21.460 --> 02:26:25.860
FU to our new Netgear wireless router that killed the internet on one of our computers

02:26:25.860 --> 02:26:28.580
and required a reformat to get the router to work.

02:26:28.580 --> 02:26:34.100
F you to my laptop for not being able to run Quake 2 using OpenGL at a smooth speed.

02:26:34.100 --> 02:26:38.540
Tomokun says fuck my friend for overdosing on a ton of nutmeg last night at the homecoming

02:26:38.540 --> 02:26:39.540
dance.

02:26:39.540 --> 02:26:42.980
She knew she was allergic to it and that it makes you more sick than high.

02:26:42.980 --> 02:26:44.780
It was attempted suicide.

02:26:44.780 --> 02:26:51.120
Fuck you for attempting suicide by overdoing something you're allergic to.

02:26:51.120 --> 02:26:54.620
And then he said don't read something but I did, I'm sorry.

02:26:54.620 --> 02:26:58.820
The Dark Knight says F you to returning to work today and almost died of heat exhaustion

02:26:58.820 --> 02:27:02.260
and an F you for my vacation coming to an end.

02:27:02.260 --> 02:27:06.900
Jaded 2005 says F you to my internet for dying during the cage match.

02:27:06.900 --> 02:27:11.180
Sakarina says F you to my teachers for only putting 10% of the marks that should be on

02:27:11.180 --> 02:27:12.620
my midterm report card.

02:27:12.620 --> 02:27:17.940
I'm not complaining about the actual marks that are there, but the ones that aren't there.

02:27:17.940 --> 02:27:21.140
Mikolatov says F you to me for giving up Taco Bell.

02:27:21.140 --> 02:27:24.140
If you know me in person, you know how big of a deal this is.

02:27:24.140 --> 02:27:29.420
just gasps. F you also to Milpitas Golf Land because that place is too ghetto to

02:27:29.420 --> 02:27:33.000
house a perfectly lovely pump exceed machine. But there was a guy that liked

02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:37.360
you at the one that we have over here. DarklionXVI says one F you for tonight. F

02:27:37.360 --> 02:27:44.080
you to Cox Communications for charging 75 bucks just to change the splitter that

02:27:44.080 --> 02:27:47.960
connects both my TV and cable modem. Few days later I'm still getting disconnects

02:27:47.960 --> 02:27:54.960
do to line and signal issues. Dark Tetsuya says F you to my crappy connection as always,

02:27:56.400 --> 02:28:03.400
and F you to Squeenix for not giving me my slime keychain with my DQ8 demo. Goggle says,

02:28:03.880 --> 02:28:07.840
and I almost said Google but I stopped myself, Goggle says, Froke everyone at the homecoming

02:28:07.840 --> 02:28:12.240
dance for stopping when Dancing Queen came on. Just because it's not rap doesn't mean

02:28:12.240 --> 02:28:16.720
you can't dance. Hey, I would have danced to Dancing Queen. It says dancing in its name.

02:28:16.720 --> 02:28:27.720
I would have danced to that. I would have danced to it and I don't really like it. You know what they played at my first homecoming dance? It just dates me? The Humpty dance.

02:28:27.720 --> 02:28:34.720
It's your chance. I don't remember what they played at our, a lot of Nirvana. Because my first homecoming was in 1990.

02:28:34.720 --> 02:28:39.720
Oh, I didn't go to my homecoming dance. No, I didn't go to the prom.

02:28:39.720 --> 02:28:46.720
I was at Red Robin last night watching all the people in their dresses and it was like a fashion show.

02:28:46.720 --> 02:28:52.720
Goggle, invite us to the prom next time and we'll dance to Dancing Queen with you.

02:28:52.720 --> 02:28:56.720
Oh my god, I would so go to the prom.

02:28:56.720 --> 02:29:00.720
Hey, I still get carded, okay?

02:29:00.720 --> 02:29:05.720
FU to the Digital Life Expo for not having that much free shit to go around this year.

02:29:05.720 --> 02:29:08.720
FU to the 8 Days of Rain we had these past few days.

02:29:08.720 --> 02:29:11.720
FU to the two asshats who host G4's X-Play.

02:29:11.720 --> 02:29:16.720
You probably know who they are for bashing the shit out of DDRXtreme 2's songs and for mocking the fuck out of it.

02:29:16.720 --> 02:29:19.720
Oh, I didn't see this. I should.

02:29:19.720 --> 02:29:24.720
SSJ100Matt says FU to the Yankees for being knocked out of the playoffs. Go White Sox.

02:29:24.720 --> 02:29:28.720
FU to this show turning into Prawn Lounge Radio.

02:29:28.720 --> 02:29:31.220
Hee hee! We're horny. No apologies.

02:29:52.720 --> 02:29:54.220
Well, it's not healthy.

02:29:54.220 --> 02:29:56.720
I double-F you that. That's crappy.

02:29:56.720 --> 02:30:00.440
You know what else? You know what? It's something about science teachers, our total cunts. I'll

02:30:00.440 --> 02:30:05.280
tell you why. Because I had a ballad. I don't care if I drop the C-bomb. This guy deserves

02:30:05.280 --> 02:30:10.280
it. My least favorite teacher of all time. Biology teacher I had in high school, right?

02:30:10.280 --> 02:30:14.040
We were supposed to do a report. We had to do a report and it was like a final. It was

02:30:14.040 --> 02:30:20.080
a final paper. And the final was on any North American animal was what the report had to

02:30:20.080 --> 02:30:25.840
be on. I chose the vampire bat. Because it had the word vampire in it and I thought it

02:30:25.840 --> 02:30:30.840
it was cool, the vampire bat is a bat from Mexico. We were all going around and

02:30:30.840 --> 02:30:34.100
what he did is he said, I'm going to give you 3 extra credit points after we handed

02:30:34.100 --> 02:30:36.720
in all our papers. He says, I want to know what you really learned and I'm going to give

02:30:36.720 --> 02:30:41.400
you three extra credit points if you memorize the scientific name of your animal. Well I

02:30:41.400 --> 02:30:45.080
knew mine and I said it out loud, and he said, great, you get the 3 extra credit points!

02:30:45.080 --> 02:30:48.360
Unfortunately, I'm going to flunk you on the paper. In fact the whole class, he said this,

02:30:48.360 --> 02:30:51.880
I'm going to flunk you on the paper because your animal is not from North America. That's

02:30:51.880 --> 02:30:55.240
bullshit! I said, that's bullshit, Mexico IS in North America! And he said, no, that's

02:30:55.240 --> 02:30:59.520
Central America. I said, I took him to task on this. I said, what do you call the North

02:30:59.520 --> 02:31:05.640
American Free Trade Agreement, which involves Canada, U.S., and Mexico? And I still, I didn't

02:31:05.640 --> 02:31:12.320
get it. I just finally, I got a D. I got a D. I got a D on the report. I would have taken

02:31:12.320 --> 02:31:15.840
it to the principal. I would have done it too. I should have, but I... I have done that

02:31:15.840 --> 02:31:20.440
to teachers when I was a child. I was too passive. I'm sorry if your teaching staff

02:31:20.440 --> 02:31:24.360
here is fucking incompetent, but... I will never forget that to this day, and this is

02:31:24.360 --> 02:31:27.360
is why I hate biology. That one incident is why I hate biology.

02:31:27.360 --> 02:31:31.360
Your science teacher was a moron because even named by the continents.

02:31:31.360 --> 02:31:36.360
Central America is just more of a categorization than it is continent.

02:31:36.360 --> 02:31:38.360
The continent is the North American continent.

02:31:38.360 --> 02:31:41.360
He backed up and said he said something from the United States.

02:31:41.360 --> 02:31:43.360
I said, no, you said North American.

02:31:43.360 --> 02:31:44.360
Exactly.

02:31:44.360 --> 02:31:46.360
Bullshit. But that guy has been teaching at the school.

02:31:46.360 --> 02:31:48.360
You should have said, excuse me.

02:31:48.360 --> 02:31:50.360
That guy had been teaching at the school for three years.

02:31:50.360 --> 02:31:51.360
What was I going to do?

02:31:51.360 --> 02:31:52.360
I could see you saying that.

02:31:52.360 --> 02:31:53.360
Go out to the baseball.

02:31:53.360 --> 02:31:57.280
write him a letter here ten years later, why I hate biology, it's because of you. Do it!

02:31:57.280 --> 02:32:03.000
Here I am on the internet bashing him. He probably has prostate cancer. He's probably

02:32:03.000 --> 02:32:09.080
dying. I hate to put it, okay, the next semester, okay, this is really bad, I don't care. You're

02:32:09.080 --> 02:32:13.080
going to kill him. No, I'm not going to, don't say that, because they'll come after me, the

02:32:13.080 --> 02:32:16.980
FBI will come after him, I'm not going to kill him. He's just a sad, sad old man with

02:32:16.980 --> 02:32:19.960
nothing better to do but fail kids on their reports because he doesn't know what he's

02:32:19.960 --> 02:32:24.800
No, but here's the thing, like the next quarter, whatever, this was like the first quarter,

02:32:24.800 --> 02:32:29.000
the next quarter, he like broke his neck, like literally, and some, we had a female

02:32:29.000 --> 02:32:33.600
teacher come in for like three months, and then he came back and he had a humongous neck

02:32:33.600 --> 02:32:36.760
brace, and my thought was, karma, motherfucker.

02:32:36.760 --> 02:32:37.760
You know what?

02:32:37.760 --> 02:32:42.000
So, you know what I feel so bad about during my high school years is because there was

02:32:42.000 --> 02:32:46.720
a teacher, my data processing teacher, who was going to flunk me on something, some random

02:32:46.720 --> 02:32:50.720
thing that I kind of stood up for myself for, and I like yelled at the guy.

02:32:50.720 --> 02:32:54.960
It was the only teacher that in, well, one of the two teachers I yelled at my whole time

02:32:54.960 --> 02:32:56.680
going to school.

02:32:56.680 --> 02:33:04.240
And a couple of years later, he died in like a kind of a freak accident involving stones

02:33:04.240 --> 02:33:05.800
and nature or something.

02:33:05.800 --> 02:33:11.480
And like he, like I never ever like got a chance to like apologize for that, you know,

02:33:11.480 --> 02:33:13.720
or whatever, because I was really kind of like...

02:33:13.720 --> 02:33:15.840
Would you like to apologize now?

02:33:15.840 --> 02:33:24.760
Well, I don't know if he's, he was a bastard, so he's probably in hell, so I guess I should

02:33:24.760 --> 02:33:28.200
look down and say, hey, how's it going?

02:33:28.200 --> 02:33:35.040
I'll see you in a couple years, in a few years, there's a few years on me.

02:33:35.040 --> 02:33:38.720
The sad thing is my biology teacher was really old, he is probably dead, he's been like ten

02:33:38.720 --> 02:33:39.720
years since high school.

02:33:39.720 --> 02:33:40.720
You know what I'm sad about?

02:33:40.720 --> 02:33:41.720
What?

02:33:41.720 --> 02:33:42.720
That we haven't done a match game.

02:33:42.720 --> 02:33:45.240
I know, we're not going to get to it either, probably.

02:33:45.240 --> 02:33:46.240
Oh darn!

02:33:46.240 --> 02:33:49.760
I haven't written questions, so I'll write questions for next week and we'll get to it

02:33:49.760 --> 02:33:50.760
for sure.

02:33:50.760 --> 02:33:55.280
Anyway, so what, now, I am, the ironic thing is, I'm a teacher now.

02:33:55.280 --> 02:33:57.120
I just don't teach high school kids, but I teach-

02:33:57.120 --> 02:33:58.120
You teach something worse.

02:33:58.120 --> 02:34:01.680
I teach adults, which is much worse in some scenarios, but you know, for the most part

02:34:01.680 --> 02:34:04.760
it's okay.

02:34:04.760 --> 02:34:06.480
Actually when I'm in class, everything is great.

02:34:06.480 --> 02:34:09.760
It's everything I have to deal with outside of class that irks me, usually.

02:34:09.760 --> 02:34:11.480
When I'm in class, everything's fine.

02:34:11.480 --> 02:34:13.400
And I actually taught X to per.

02:34:13.400 --> 02:34:14.400
You did.

02:34:14.400 --> 02:34:16.440
You're my daddy.

02:34:16.440 --> 02:34:17.280
No, you aren't.

02:34:17.280 --> 02:34:19.440
And extrovert got 100% on most of his exams.

02:34:19.440 --> 02:34:21.080
I got 100%.

02:34:21.080 --> 02:34:22.120
Yes, he did.

02:34:22.120 --> 02:34:24.200
OK, but teachers, for the most part,

02:34:24.200 --> 02:34:25.320
are usually really awesome.

02:34:25.320 --> 02:34:26.120
They really are.

02:34:26.120 --> 02:34:26.840
You want to know why?

02:34:26.840 --> 02:34:28.280
I've had a lot of awesome teachers.

02:34:28.280 --> 02:34:29.800
You know what's very sad, though,

02:34:29.800 --> 02:34:31.360
is that for all the training classes

02:34:31.360 --> 02:34:33.760
that they've been making us do, or they've

02:34:33.760 --> 02:34:36.240
been making us learn all the customer service crap.

02:34:36.240 --> 02:34:38.840
And I did customer service, so I knew all of the shit,

02:34:38.840 --> 02:34:41.000
and I helped teach the class, basically.

02:34:41.000 --> 02:34:47.240
I would suggest things that might not have been in the material that they would need

02:34:47.240 --> 02:34:48.240
to know.

02:34:48.240 --> 02:34:50.760
You know, that's how I got into training, though, where I work, is that I was sitting

02:34:50.760 --> 02:34:51.920
in the class as a student.

02:34:51.920 --> 02:34:55.480
I was suggesting how to make it better, and that impressed the trainer, and she suggested

02:34:55.480 --> 02:34:56.480
I should be in.

02:34:56.480 --> 02:35:00.800
See, HR positions aren't opening up in my work, so I'm going into compliance if I get

02:35:00.800 --> 02:35:01.940
the job.

02:35:01.940 --> 02:35:03.440
I want to be in HR.

02:35:03.440 --> 02:35:04.440
That's one of my things.

02:35:04.440 --> 02:35:05.440
I really do want to be in HR.

02:35:05.440 --> 02:35:09.240
Well, this is great and all, but let's get into another segment.

02:35:09.240 --> 02:35:10.240
So back to HR.

02:35:10.240 --> 02:35:11.240
in it.

02:35:11.240 --> 02:35:13.400
Yeah, you want to be all up in it, I'm sure.

02:35:13.400 --> 02:35:14.400
Let's get back to Angel's Watersports.

02:35:14.400 --> 02:35:15.400
Humpin' Repulses.

02:35:15.400 --> 02:35:16.400
Huh?

02:35:16.400 --> 02:35:17.800
Humpin' Repulses.

02:35:17.800 --> 02:35:18.800
The Humpty Dance.

02:35:18.800 --> 02:35:19.800
All right.

02:35:19.800 --> 02:35:21.280
I want to get back to Angel's Watersports.

02:35:21.280 --> 02:35:22.720
I don't want to get back to Angel's Watersports.

02:35:22.720 --> 02:35:23.720
Oh, okay.

02:35:23.720 --> 02:35:25.720
Then we don't have to get to your Watersports.

02:35:25.720 --> 02:35:27.720
She's doing the blink thing, where she's like, blink, blink, what?

02:35:27.720 --> 02:35:29.720
I like alcohol.

02:35:29.720 --> 02:35:30.720
You know-

02:35:30.720 --> 02:35:35.320
Alcohol makes you pee, and peeing has to do with Angel's Watersports.

02:35:35.320 --> 02:35:36.960
How about that, Angel?

02:35:36.960 --> 02:35:41.960
Um, no, but Jamie is the only one that successfully got me to drink liquor once.

02:35:41.960 --> 02:35:42.960
Is that good?

02:35:42.960 --> 02:35:43.960
Yeah.

02:35:43.960 --> 02:35:45.960
I'm gonna bring over some sake one day.

02:35:45.960 --> 02:35:46.960
And did you pee?

02:35:46.960 --> 02:35:49.960
Can I bring up an actually relevant Bimani story real quick?

02:35:49.960 --> 02:35:50.960
Sure, Rod!

02:35:50.960 --> 02:35:53.960
Okay, we're gonna go to break and we're gonna come back and do Ask Orange Lounge because

02:35:53.960 --> 02:35:55.960
the chat room is begging for it tonight.

02:35:55.960 --> 02:35:58.960
Somebody gave me a link to this and I don't remember who now.

02:35:58.960 --> 02:35:59.960
Oh, it was Goggle.

02:35:59.960 --> 02:36:00.960
Goggle gave me this.

02:36:00.960 --> 02:36:01.960
Thank you, Goggle.

02:36:01.960 --> 02:36:02.960
Cuntastic.

02:36:02.960 --> 02:36:04.960
No, it's not, it's not Cuntastic.

02:36:04.960 --> 02:36:06.960
Oh, I mean, I kind of said that on a whim.

02:36:06.960 --> 02:36:08.960
Yeah, you did. So shut up.

02:36:08.960 --> 02:36:10.960
Take his mic. Loki, please take his microphone away.

02:36:10.960 --> 02:36:13.960
He's punished. Take it away. Take it away.

02:36:13.960 --> 02:36:14.960
All right.

02:36:14.960 --> 02:36:21.960
Vagle sent us a story, and it has to do with the Serious Games Summit.

02:36:21.960 --> 02:36:22.960
Seriously, you guys, serious.

02:36:22.960 --> 02:36:28.960
No, what it is actually, it's going to be a, I guess, kind of summit thing going on.

02:36:28.960 --> 02:36:31.960
It's actually going to happen in Washington, D.C. at the Serious Games Summit.

02:36:31.960 --> 02:36:33.960
And it's going to be Monday, October 31st.

02:36:33.960 --> 02:36:39.920
October 31st. Hey, that's Halloween. From 4.15 PM to 5.15 PM, it's a, like, session

02:36:39.920 --> 02:36:46.480
on Dance Dance Revolution, the most researched serious game ever. Why and what have we learned?

02:36:46.480 --> 02:36:51.480
And here's what it says on the little website synopsis. DDR is a game, a social activity,

02:36:51.480 --> 02:36:56.520
a dance and performance platform, a community, a form of vigorous exercise, a weight loss

02:36:56.520 --> 02:37:00.720
tool and more. It serves different needs for different people and it has been put to many

02:37:00.720 --> 02:37:06.640
any surprising uses. This talk analyzes, or as I like to say, analizes, the appeal of

02:37:06.640 --> 02:37:11.040
DDR and the many ways it has been implemented and researched as a serious game. It reviews

02:37:11.040 --> 02:37:16.300
current research finding and then examines the exergaming phenomenon in general and where

02:37:16.300 --> 02:37:19.040
it is heading. And I bet you we won't be mentioned at all.

02:37:19.040 --> 02:37:28.040
Dude, that's insulting, because we're fabulous. We are the backbone of the DDR community.

02:37:58.040 --> 02:38:01.040
We are the backbone of the DDR community.

02:38:01.040 --> 02:38:05.040
Actually, we are the backbone of the entire video gaming community, really.

02:38:05.040 --> 02:38:08.040
Because we are the number one rated podcast.

02:38:08.040 --> 02:38:14.040
I don't know about that, but we managed to win an award, and we're cool.

02:38:14.040 --> 02:38:16.040
Adam Curry digs us.

02:38:16.040 --> 02:38:18.040
That's right, Adam Curry likes us.

02:38:18.040 --> 02:38:20.040
I like his hair.

02:38:20.040 --> 02:38:25.040
Adam Curry, if you're listening, I want to know what hairstyle you're talking about.

02:38:25.040 --> 02:38:27.040
He's listening. He's got nothing better to do than say,

02:38:27.040 --> 02:38:29.040
Oh, I'm going to listen to Orange Lawn's radio tonight because I want to hear it.

02:38:29.040 --> 02:38:32.040
He's probably listening to his old tapes that he did.

02:38:32.040 --> 02:38:36.040
You know, DJing on MTV or whatever.

02:38:36.040 --> 02:38:38.040
I like Adam Curry, and he was...

02:38:38.040 --> 02:38:40.040
I had such a thing for Adam Curry when I was younger.

02:38:40.040 --> 02:38:42.040
Really? I kind of liked him too when I was younger.

02:38:42.040 --> 02:38:45.040
And Colin Quinn, actually, because I liked his jaw.

02:38:45.040 --> 02:38:47.040
I didn't like that.

02:38:47.040 --> 02:38:50.040
If somebody would go to this lecture and tape it for us and get us a CD

02:38:50.040 --> 02:38:53.040
so we can mock it on air, that would be great.

02:38:53.040 --> 02:38:57.040
No, I'm sure it'll be interesting. I'm curious to see what they have to say. We'll see.

02:38:57.040 --> 02:39:03.040
Alright, we'll be back after this. We're going to take a quick Tucson break and we're going to do some Ask Orange Lounge.

02:39:03.040 --> 02:39:05.040
Sending your questions right now kids

02:39:33.040 --> 02:39:57.040
I'm a thief, I'm a thief I'm a thief, I'm a thief

02:39:57.040 --> 02:40:15.040
I believe, I believe, I believe

02:41:27.040 --> 02:41:48.200
Music

02:41:48.200 --> 02:42:04.200
Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

02:42:04.200 --> 02:42:17.200
We're back on Orange Lounge Radio, and we're going to get into a little segment here you guys know and love.

02:42:17.200 --> 02:42:20.200
We're getting a lot of questions tonight, too, so we've got to get right into it.

02:42:20.200 --> 02:42:22.200
It's Ask Orange Lounge.

02:42:22.200 --> 02:42:26.200
Don't forget our podcast, boys and girls, which we do every week.

02:42:26.200 --> 02:42:29.200
www.orangeloungelounge.com. Click on the to-go edition.

02:42:29.200 --> 02:42:32.200
Are you okay? What the hell?

02:42:32.200 --> 02:42:34.200
I'm making funny faces.

02:42:34.200 --> 02:42:35.200
Why are you making faces?

02:42:35.200 --> 02:42:36.200
Because I can.

02:42:36.200 --> 02:42:40.200
We're going to do some Ask Orange Lounge.

02:42:40.200 --> 02:42:51.600
Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid questions. What will we find out this week on Orange

02:42:51.600 --> 02:42:58.720
Lounge Radio? Perhaps a question we will find the answer to is why Jamie is smiling when

02:42:58.720 --> 02:43:06.060
she comes out of the bathroom. I am still going to kick you. She's going to cut you.

02:43:06.060 --> 02:43:08.060
I'm gonna squeeze the ferret to death.

02:43:36.060 --> 02:43:37.340
It does happen once in a while.

02:43:37.340 --> 02:43:38.700
It's just not a regular thing.

02:43:38.700 --> 02:43:40.220
The cage match is long enough as it is.

02:43:40.220 --> 02:43:43.580
We don't want to add another song to it.

02:43:43.580 --> 02:43:45.840
NintendoManiac64 also wants to know, we're going to have

02:43:45.840 --> 02:43:47.420
time for some more Skype, right?

02:43:47.420 --> 02:43:49.340
I just downloaded it and got it working, and I'm, like,

02:43:49.340 --> 02:43:52.620
uber excited for it.

02:43:52.620 --> 02:43:54.620
Maybe.

02:43:54.620 --> 02:43:57.580
Jaded2005 says, oh, this is actually a good question.

02:43:57.580 --> 02:44:01.380
Jaded2005 wants to know, how did you first get into DDR?

02:44:04.580 --> 02:44:05.760
May I?

02:44:05.760 --> 02:44:09.160
I was going to Anime Expo

02:44:09.160 --> 02:44:13.280
and this was in 96

02:44:13.280 --> 02:44:16.680
no no no no it was after that it was like 98

02:44:16.680 --> 02:44:20.600
was my first Anime Expo and I got into Busta Move right after that

02:44:20.600 --> 02:44:26.280
and then I went to Anime Expo the next year which was

02:44:26.280 --> 02:44:30.400
AX99 and someone had the first DDR for Playstation there

02:44:30.400 --> 02:44:34.160
and I was in the middle of the Busta Move 2 tournament which really pissed me off

02:44:34.160 --> 02:44:39.160
off because I was beating everybody for a solid hour, and then decimated my first guy,

02:44:39.160 --> 02:44:45.640
got to the second guy, and got a faulty controller. I was also cosplaying Shorty that year. But

02:44:45.640 --> 02:44:48.780
I thought it was really cool because I heard Casey and the Sunshine Band, and so I had

02:44:48.780 --> 02:44:53.640
to get my own copy. So I got my first DDR that I ever owned, was like a burn of the

02:44:53.640 --> 02:45:00.160
first one, and then I got a DDR for Dreamcast. And then I played my first machine at the

02:45:00.160 --> 02:45:08.160
the next AX, which was a third mix. So AX 2000 was my first machine, and AX 99 was my

02:45:08.160 --> 02:45:13.960
first time playing DDR. But I actually got, I actually played BeatMania before that, and

02:45:13.960 --> 02:45:19.320
I played Dance Dance Dance, which sucked. The first time I ever saw DDR was at Milpitas

02:45:19.320 --> 02:45:23.680
Golf Land, and it was the same weekend I lost my virginity. Just thought you'd like to know.

02:45:23.680 --> 02:45:29.400
Can you describe that to us in detail? Yes, actually, at first, no, I'm not going to.

02:45:29.400 --> 02:45:32.400
You can't describe your DDR experience? That's what I was asking you.

02:45:32.400 --> 02:45:33.400
I'm sure you were.

02:45:33.400 --> 02:45:36.400
I mean, why would I ask you to describe your first experience anal sex-wise?

02:45:36.400 --> 02:45:37.400
Shut up!

02:45:37.400 --> 02:45:40.400
God, take his mic away. Do it.

02:45:40.400 --> 02:45:43.400
This time, don't give it back. This time, don't give it back.

02:45:43.400 --> 02:45:50.400
How I got into DDR was I moved in with my roommate.

02:45:50.400 --> 02:45:56.400
I was a fan of me. I saw BeatMania one year and DDR the next year.

02:45:56.400 --> 02:46:05.400
I have a whole pile of 5 key beatmanias that I don't play.

02:46:26.400 --> 02:46:32.400
Never. Never. Never. I said I don't shave my genitals.

02:46:32.400 --> 02:46:36.400
It's not a shave. Stop it. Who gave him the mic back? Who? Who did that?

02:46:36.400 --> 02:46:41.400
Loki did. You were responsible for keeping the microphone safe from his blasphemy.

02:46:41.400 --> 02:46:44.400
Sakarina also wants to know, can Mr. Spanky get back on the show soon?

02:46:44.400 --> 02:46:48.400
Blast for me, blast for you. Yes, Mr. Spanky can come back on the show someday, yes?

02:46:48.400 --> 02:46:52.400
I don't know about soon. We don't want him to jump the shark, but he'll be back.

02:46:52.400 --> 02:46:53.400
back.

02:46:53.400 --> 02:46:54.560
We need Betty to come.

02:46:54.560 --> 02:46:59.640
Sacrina also wants to know, can Exeterfer get the mic back and start another sex-related

02:46:59.640 --> 02:47:00.640
joke for this week?

02:47:00.640 --> 02:47:01.640
No, he can't.

02:47:01.640 --> 02:47:02.640
No.

02:47:02.640 --> 02:47:06.680
You can next week.

02:47:06.680 --> 02:47:11.280
Tomo Koon wants to know, what's your worst homecoming memory?

02:47:11.280 --> 02:47:15.080
Junior homecoming, which I showed up for 30 minutes.

02:47:15.080 --> 02:47:19.120
My date had a mullet and I left.

02:47:19.120 --> 02:47:21.600
I actually don't have negative homecoming stories to tell.

02:47:21.600 --> 02:47:25.800
I, for the most part, they were pretty good. You know, I first kissed a girl my freshman year at homecoming.

02:47:25.800 --> 02:47:28.320
I had this flu for prom.

02:47:28.320 --> 02:47:31.600
Why are you laughing at that, Extover?

02:47:31.600 --> 02:47:33.640
Because...

02:47:33.640 --> 02:47:38.360
I just want to know what went through that girl's mind when she kissed you.

02:47:38.360 --> 02:47:44.800
Like, oh, that's more of a friend. That's not a boyfriend.

02:47:44.800 --> 02:47:46.120
Like...

02:47:46.120 --> 02:47:48.680
I don't know. My mind.

02:47:48.680 --> 02:47:51.400
It's gone. Anyways, um...

02:47:51.400 --> 02:47:55.400
No, actually, my ex, she sucked because she was...

02:47:55.400 --> 02:47:56.760
She wouldn't put out.

02:47:56.760 --> 02:48:11.440
Well, that too, but no, she was kind of, she played soccer and she, like, injured her knee, like, four fucking years ago or something like that, and so, for whatever reason, it conveniently acted up whenever, you know, she'd go to a dance and she sucked.

02:48:11.440 --> 02:48:14.160
So, anyways, hell with her.

02:48:14.160 --> 02:48:17.700
Goggle wants to know, on the serious game summit thing, just an aside, apparently my

02:48:17.700 --> 02:48:21.680
uncle is speaking that day on another topic, I'll see if I can persuade him to go to the

02:48:21.680 --> 02:48:22.680
DDR thing.

02:48:22.680 --> 02:48:26.560
Let us know if they're doing like, cause usually those summit type things, they sell CDs or

02:48:26.560 --> 02:48:29.600
something, but they're usually really expensive, but you never know, we might be able to get

02:48:29.600 --> 02:48:30.720
a deal or something.

02:48:30.720 --> 02:48:33.560
So that's cool, um, good luck to your uncle on whatever topic he's speaking on.

02:48:33.560 --> 02:48:36.480
Did you both put on, like, lip gloss before you guys kissed?

02:48:36.480 --> 02:48:37.480
Will you shut up?

02:48:37.480 --> 02:48:38.480
Oh my god!

02:48:38.480 --> 02:48:39.480
Loki!

02:48:39.480 --> 02:48:40.480
Let's kiss!

02:48:40.480 --> 02:48:41.480
Loki!

02:48:41.480 --> 02:48:42.480
Hold on to this.

02:48:42.480 --> 02:48:43.480
Put on my lip gloss!

02:48:43.480 --> 02:48:48.360
the mic away. My name is Rob Roberts. Kiss me. I'm just going to unplug him from the

02:48:48.360 --> 02:48:55.360
board so he can't speak. Matt's got it back. And you're giving him his own show? Shame

02:48:55.360 --> 02:49:00.000
on you. You know what? I don't have to be here. Nobody has to listen if they don't want

02:49:00.000 --> 02:49:07.000
to. But if... Actually, extrovert looks all offended. Here's the thing though. If extrovert

02:49:07.000 --> 02:49:18.540
Here's the thing though, if Extra Real Show gets lower ratings than Diversion did, which

02:49:18.540 --> 02:49:22.660
is going to be very hard to do, if Extra Real Show gets lower ratings than Diversion did,

02:49:22.660 --> 02:49:24.660
you are getting cancelled.

02:49:24.660 --> 02:49:30.020
No, you're not taking the mic, it's my mic.

02:49:30.020 --> 02:49:33.620
Goggle has a serious question.

02:49:33.620 --> 02:49:39.620
I want to Skype in, but I have no microphone. Where can I get one, and how much should I expect to pay for one?

02:49:39.620 --> 02:49:40.620
Radio Shack, $5.

02:49:40.620 --> 02:49:49.620
Yeah, they're actually really cheap. You can get a nice little headset at Target for $19.99, and that would be like headphones with a little mic thing, which is good for TeamSpeak and stuff.

02:49:49.620 --> 02:49:55.620
Actually, Office Depot was clearing out the Alta Glancing ones for $10, and Alta Glancing is really good.

02:49:55.620 --> 02:50:01.300
really good. Shop around. If you're interested in buying on the internet, check out Google's

02:50:01.300 --> 02:50:03.940
search thing. I know that's kind of ironic that I'm telling you to go to Google, but

02:50:03.940 --> 02:50:08.940
they have that compare prices thing that's really cool. I recommend if you're going to

02:50:08.940 --> 02:50:16.660
buy a computer thing, make it a brand name like Logitech or something. Greeny wants to

02:50:16.660 --> 02:50:21.140
know, do any of you play double mode? Have you rolled up the king yet? Can you substitute

02:50:21.140 --> 02:50:25.340
sound effects to bleep out profanity in the future? Question number one, do any of you

02:50:25.340 --> 02:50:28.340
I used to, but I'm too fat now.

02:50:28.340 --> 02:50:30.340
Dark Soccer, you used to play on Double Mode too, right? Still do?

02:50:30.340 --> 02:50:34.340
Actually, I used to do nothing but doubles for a little while.

02:50:34.340 --> 02:50:35.340
That's all I play.

02:50:35.340 --> 02:50:37.340
Loki? Yeah, you play a lot of doubles, Loki.

02:50:37.340 --> 02:50:43.340
Yeah, even now that I have, like, no stamina, I still play doubles, because singles just not for me.

02:50:43.340 --> 02:50:45.340
Ironic, we all play doubles. That's kind of weird.

02:50:45.340 --> 02:50:47.340
It's not at home, because, you know, I don't...

02:50:47.340 --> 02:50:49.340
Yeah, not at home. I'll only do it in the arcade.

02:50:49.340 --> 02:50:50.340
That's kind of weird.

02:50:50.340 --> 02:50:54.340
Uh, have you rolled up the king yet? No, in fact, I haven't played Katamari Damacy in a little while.

02:50:54.340 --> 02:50:57.620
I have had no time to play.

02:50:57.620 --> 02:51:01.780
I'm gonna play the Japanese version for some reason. Can you substitute sound effects to

02:51:01.780 --> 02:51:03.700
bleep out profanity in the future? Dude,

02:51:03.700 --> 02:51:07.020
it's the motherfucking internet and we're gonna say what we want. And we don't have a delay.

02:51:07.020 --> 02:51:08.580
Yeah, we don't have a delay or anything either.

02:51:08.580 --> 02:51:13.060
Yeah, and you know who we would put in charge

02:51:13.060 --> 02:51:16.100
of the delay if we had one? Exover.

02:51:16.100 --> 02:51:22.900
And you know that wouldn't work. Ron Chan wants to know how come you guys don't play

02:51:22.900 --> 02:51:27.620
the full versions of the songs that are in DDR, 2DX, and so forth.

02:51:27.620 --> 02:51:28.620
The reason why...

02:51:28.620 --> 02:51:29.620
We have.

02:51:29.620 --> 02:51:33.780
We have in the past, and you hear that sometimes on the spin-off shows, but there's only been

02:51:33.780 --> 02:51:37.340
one lately, and she likes to play non-DDR stuff on her show.

02:51:37.340 --> 02:51:38.420
But she will once in a while, right?

02:51:38.420 --> 02:51:42.260
I actually have done odd-but-money shows, and I've played the long versions.

02:51:42.260 --> 02:51:45.980
And every so often I sneak in the Korean stuff.

02:51:45.980 --> 02:51:50.340
If we played them on this show, our breaks would be really long, and we want to make

02:51:50.340 --> 02:51:53.900
sure it's a lot of talking you know to want to keep the music minimal um we'll

02:51:53.900 --> 02:51:57.880
do it occasionally though I'm tuned in maybe on maybe that's an idea for my

02:51:57.880 --> 02:52:00.460
spin-off show I'll play nothing but long version of the money songs that might be

02:52:00.460 --> 02:52:08.560
cool so we'll see um good yeah SSJ 100 Matt wants to know which would you

02:52:08.560 --> 02:52:14.700
rather see remade on a next-gen console chrono trigger or Final Fantasy 7

02:52:14.700 --> 02:52:19.820
neither guardian legend yeah guardian legend but if I had to choose between

02:52:19.820 --> 02:52:24.820
between the two? Yeah, if I had to choose between the two. I would say Final Fantasy VII so that it actually looks good.

02:52:24.820 --> 02:52:42.820
Because Chrono Trigger was already perfect. I'm going to say Chrono Trigger because I did not get into Chrono Trigger when it was on the Super Nintendo. I never got what the big deal was about Chrono Trigger. I mean, it was cool and all, but I did not nearly obsess over that game. I think a remake might help kick my ass a little bit into giving it a second look.

02:52:42.820 --> 02:52:46.820
I've beaten Chrono Trigger. I've gotten like 7 of the 14 endings.

02:52:47.820 --> 02:52:51.820
I got the Toriyama ending. That was pretty cool.

02:52:53.820 --> 02:52:58.820
Anybody else want to share what they would see remade on the next gen console? Chrono Trigger or Final Fantasy 7?

02:52:58.820 --> 02:53:00.820
Both can be remade anyways.

02:53:01.820 --> 02:53:06.820
Chrono Trigger is going to be an MMO and Final Fantasy 7 is being remade for the PS3, so you'll get them both.

02:53:06.820 --> 02:53:10.820
Leadfoot wants to know, should I buy In the Groove or just stick with DDR Extreme 2?

02:53:10.820 --> 02:53:11.820
DDR.

02:53:11.820 --> 02:53:17.820
Well, if you are choosing between those two, buy Extreme 2, definitely.

02:53:17.820 --> 02:53:22.820
If you're just kind of bored with Extreme 2 and you want a new game, I'm cool with In The Groove.

02:53:22.820 --> 02:53:23.820
Pump It Up.

02:53:23.820 --> 02:53:28.820
Oh yeah, Pump It Up first though, honestly. Buy Pump It Up before you buy In The Groove.

02:53:28.820 --> 02:53:30.820
Seriously, Pump It Up is a great game.

02:53:30.820 --> 02:53:32.820
If you get bored of those, go play Step Mania.

02:53:32.820 --> 02:53:37.820
Then you could buy In The Groove. In The Groove will hold you over. It will.

02:53:37.820 --> 02:53:43.420
here. Zaku says here's a cool fact about this weekend's DDR tournament. No more

02:53:43.420 --> 02:53:47.040
questions guys. No more questions. Final call for questions. Here's a cool

02:53:47.040 --> 02:53:50.080
fact about this weekend's CDR tournament that you probably didn't know. There was

02:53:50.080 --> 02:53:53.140
one event called Ironman in which you had to do an Oni course without the bar.

02:53:53.140 --> 02:53:57.420
It was done on a DDR machine ghetto rigged to a PS2. Both screen and pad so folks

02:53:57.420 --> 02:54:01.540
had to do max period on an arcade pad.

02:54:01.540 --> 02:54:10.180
Ron Chan says, do you like this as the name of your spin-off show, The Sky Effect?

02:54:10.180 --> 02:54:15.020
I liked, somebody suggested This Week in Sky as a parody of This Week in Tech.

02:54:15.020 --> 02:54:20.860
I should do This Week in Sky, although it would sound like something that would be exploring

02:54:20.860 --> 02:54:24.020
like me, and I don't know about that.

02:54:24.020 --> 02:54:25.620
The Life Aquatic with Rob Robber.

02:54:25.620 --> 02:54:27.940
How about we've blown it sky-high.

02:54:27.940 --> 02:54:33.940
All right, we're done with that.

02:54:33.940 --> 02:54:35.620
You know, I'm not going to say anything crude.

02:54:35.620 --> 02:54:39.740
I just thought that The Life Aquatic, starring Rob Roberts, would be a good title.

02:54:39.740 --> 02:54:41.220
The Life Bemonic.

02:54:41.220 --> 02:54:42.220
The Life Bemonic.

02:54:42.220 --> 02:54:43.220
Yeah.

02:54:43.220 --> 02:54:45.860
And my show is not going to be crude, by the way.

02:54:45.860 --> 02:54:49.580
I mean, I may say some crude things, but just listen in.

02:54:49.580 --> 02:54:50.580
It'll be fun.

02:54:50.580 --> 02:54:51.580
All right.

02:54:51.580 --> 02:54:53.860
Say something good about it, Rob.

02:54:53.860 --> 02:55:00.860
going to be fabulous. When I say fabulous, I mean stupid. I'm just kidding. It's going

02:55:02.180 --> 02:55:08.560
to be interesting. It's going to be interesting. Cool. Like picking your nose and eating it.

02:55:08.560 --> 02:55:15.560
That's interesting too. I'd rather do a Brazilian wax jar. Alright. It's 9.30. We've got to

02:55:16.860 --> 02:55:20.300
get a final look. I'm just picking you in, Joke. Final thoughts. Angel, your final thought.

02:55:20.300 --> 02:55:24.780
Nice for being here and not filling this show with sexual innuendo like Extrofer.

02:55:24.780 --> 02:55:25.780
Why would I?

02:55:25.780 --> 02:55:26.780
Except for that water sports thing.

02:55:26.780 --> 02:55:27.780
That was hella gross.

02:55:27.780 --> 02:55:31.380
That was his fault.

02:55:31.380 --> 02:55:34.860
What's your final thought?

02:55:34.860 --> 02:55:36.500
My PC must work.

02:55:36.500 --> 02:55:39.580
Extrofer, your final thought.

02:55:39.580 --> 02:55:42.880
Orange Lounge Radio a week from tomorrow.

02:55:42.880 --> 02:55:46.500
Extrofer's case of the Mondays.

02:55:46.500 --> 02:55:49.140
You'll have it.

02:55:49.140 --> 02:55:50.500
I might catch something else.

02:55:50.500 --> 02:55:54.660
Queer guy's voice with a straight guy's ear.

02:55:54.660 --> 02:55:55.140
And girls.

02:55:55.140 --> 02:55:56.380
Loki, your final thought.

02:55:59.900 --> 02:56:03.860
You should name your show Bad Dude with Sky.

02:56:03.860 --> 02:56:07.100
Are you a bad enough dude to eat a cheeseburger?

02:56:07.100 --> 02:56:09.380
I'll just call my show The Guardian Legend.

02:56:09.380 --> 02:56:11.620
Awesome.

02:56:11.620 --> 02:56:16.060
My final thought is I'm sorry that we didn't get to open up

02:56:16.060 --> 02:56:17.500
the Skype line again.

02:56:17.500 --> 02:56:21.500
We ran out of time, by talking about us and fucking letting Christopher talk.

02:56:23.500 --> 02:56:24.500
Just kidding.

02:56:24.500 --> 02:56:26.500
DarkSanka, your final thought?

02:56:27.500 --> 02:56:32.500
Reject false icons and remember it's down the road, not across the street, kids. Do it right.

02:56:33.500 --> 02:56:40.500
That's it. One word of the show to sum everything up. One word. Final word of the show. Angel, I'm going to give it to you. Final word. What is it?

02:56:41.500 --> 02:56:43.500
Water sports. Wow.

02:56:43.500 --> 02:56:50.500
That does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live.

02:56:50.500 --> 02:56:55.500
