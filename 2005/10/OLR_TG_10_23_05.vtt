00:36.180 --> 00:40.520
Roberts. You might know me as Sky. Not joining us tonight is DarkSakura. She has the week

00:40.520 --> 00:43.260
off, but over there in the other corner is the one and only Loki.

00:43.260 --> 00:46.260
Yep, still here. Yep, still here. How you doing?

00:46.260 --> 00:48.780
Good. Frustrated. Frustrated? Why?

00:48.780 --> 00:52.020
Oh, web page crap. Yeah. Our web page?

00:52.020 --> 00:56.820
Yes, our web page. OrangeLaunchRadio.com or the OLR PSP site?

00:56.820 --> 01:02.940
The problem is, I don't know how to program in said languages that I'm programming in,

01:02.940 --> 01:05.300
and so, yeah, it's a little difficult.

01:05.300 --> 01:06.660
It's kind of a learning experience.

01:06.660 --> 01:09.400
You must be trying to cook up some cool stuff for the site.

01:09.400 --> 01:10.400
Of course.

01:10.400 --> 01:11.400
All right.

01:11.400 --> 01:12.400
Sounds good.

01:12.400 --> 01:13.400
Check that out.

01:13.400 --> 01:14.400
OLRPSP.com.

01:14.400 --> 01:15.400
It's our new site just for the PSPs.

01:15.400 --> 01:20.060
I mean, you can bring it up on like Internet Explorer or Firefox, but seriously, it's really

01:20.060 --> 01:21.060
made for your PSP.

01:21.060 --> 01:22.620
It looks so much better on a PSP.

01:22.620 --> 01:26.780
If you bring it up in Firefox, you're going to go, what the heck, this doesn't look right.

01:26.780 --> 01:30.780
But on a PSP it looks great. High def and everything, it's awesome.

01:30.780 --> 01:34.060
Yeah, we're working on something that's kind of with the theme of the normal

01:34.060 --> 01:35.660
station that is, you know,

01:35.660 --> 01:42.020
getting our listeners to basically give us feedback and just a

01:42.020 --> 01:44.380
whole way of connecting with our listeners.

01:44.380 --> 01:48.740
Absolutely. So, actually we also have the Orange Lounge Radio message line which

01:48.740 --> 01:52.060
just opened up on our website for our live show, so we might be using that on our

01:52.060 --> 01:53.700
podcast as well, so

01:53.700 --> 01:58.220
It's more interactivity to make this a little bit your show as well because we appreciate

01:58.220 --> 02:00.680
you guys tuning in and taking the time to listen.

02:00.680 --> 02:05.020
So it's just Loki and I tonight and nobody else wanted to come, nobody else wanted to

02:05.020 --> 02:06.020
be on the podcast.

02:06.020 --> 02:07.820
No, it's cool.

02:07.820 --> 02:12.020
We got a little bit of news to talk about tonight, but first we always talk about how

02:12.020 --> 02:16.140
our gaming week was, what we've been playing and what's new in our gaming world because

02:16.140 --> 02:17.140
you know what?

02:17.140 --> 02:18.140
We're geeks too.

02:18.140 --> 02:19.140
Loki, what have you been playing?

02:19.140 --> 02:22.180
I have been playing a couple of things.

02:22.180 --> 02:26.900
I started off with Burnout because I had to get the rest of Burnout out of my system and

02:26.900 --> 02:31.180
then I've got my new baby and that would be The Warriors.

02:31.180 --> 02:32.180
The Warriors?

02:32.180 --> 02:33.180
I've never even heard of this.

02:33.180 --> 02:34.180
What's this about?

02:34.180 --> 02:37.900
The Warriors is a game based on the 1979 movie starring Michael Beck.

02:37.900 --> 02:41.460
It's basically about the gangs of New York.

02:41.460 --> 02:48.900
This is about gangs during 1979.

02:48.900 --> 02:52.860
really cheesy themed gangs like you have a gang called the baseball furies are

02:52.860 --> 02:57.240
dressed up like baseball players you have a gang of like mime looking people

02:57.240 --> 03:01.840
when you're a jet you know yes seriously it looks like that it's very similar to

03:01.840 --> 03:05.720
that but it's just so cheesy and cool the game is really awesome it's kind of

03:05.720 --> 03:08.580
like a final fight type game where you just beat up everything but they've

03:08.580 --> 03:11.600
actually have a story to it it actually takes place three months before the

03:11.600 --> 03:14.320
events of the movie then the very end of the game goes through the events of the

03:14.320 --> 03:21.080
movie. The story of the movie is that there's this one guy who's calling all these gangs

03:21.080 --> 03:24.960
together to unite them because they outnumber the police and they're basically going to

03:24.960 --> 03:31.040
take over New York. Well, this other gang frames the Warriors and they kill the guy

03:31.040 --> 03:35.360
and so now everybody's out to kill you and so you have to get back to your home turf

03:35.360 --> 03:39.080
of Coney Island before you get beaten to death.

03:39.080 --> 03:43.000
this must be a rock star game it's a rock star game it's really awesome I

03:43.000 --> 03:45.940
highly recommend checking out we actually what's cool about it is they

03:45.940 --> 03:47.240
have a quick match mode

03:47.240 --> 03:51.400
where you can just do fighting so you can do two-player co-op in it which is awesome

03:51.400 --> 03:55.040
and it's just it's a really fun game to pick up there's tons of unlockable

03:55.040 --> 03:55.640
what system?

03:55.640 --> 03:59.640
PlayStation 2 and Xbox. Oh and Xbox Live on Xbox?

03:59.640 --> 04:02.920
No. Oh bummer. Yeah but it's really awesome

04:02.920 --> 04:06.520
and then this next week in a few days here I'll be picking up Grand Theft Auto

04:06.520 --> 04:10.920
of Liberty City Stories, which I'm very excited about that one.

04:10.920 --> 04:13.320
Speaking of Xbox, do you know what Xbox Live is going to be?

04:13.320 --> 04:15.000
Not that you care, because you don't really play Xbox Live, right?

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
I don't have an Xbox.

04:17.000 --> 04:20.600
I thought you got one, finally, but you're going to be getting a 360, right?

04:20.600 --> 04:21.600
Yeah.

04:21.600 --> 04:25.200
So are you going to buy any old Xbox games to catch up on what you missed?

04:25.200 --> 04:27.960
Maybe Far Cry, because I've been hearing that's good.

04:27.960 --> 04:30.600
Not even like Burnout on the Xbox, so you can play on Live, right?

04:30.600 --> 04:35.080
Burnout for the 360 is coming out in March, so I've got to wait for Burnout.

04:35.080 --> 04:36.080
Who cares about the other ones?

04:36.080 --> 04:39.640
Alright, you know they're taking down Xbox Live for a day,

04:39.640 --> 04:43.680
I don't get on Xbox Live that much so it's not too big a deal,

04:43.680 --> 04:47.360
but they're gonna be changing it and getting it ready for the Xbox 360

04:47.360 --> 04:51.640
and so I guess, you know, I was kinda trying to look into and during our

04:51.640 --> 04:52.640
three-hour show

04:52.640 --> 04:57.120
earlier this week we were kinda talking to some of our listeners, trying to get feedback on how the new

04:57.120 --> 05:00.600
Xbox 360, what their thoughts are on it, and it sounds like you're gonna be actually

05:00.600 --> 05:03.720
able to change your gamertag whenever you want on the new 360,

05:03.720 --> 05:07.800
it's tied to your passport. You know the whole Microsoft passport thing?

05:07.800 --> 05:11.360
They're integrating that into the 360 it sounds like, so

05:11.360 --> 05:14.360
that's kinda what we're hearing. Well that's cool, at least in that way you can have a

05:14.360 --> 05:17.320
gamertag, you know, that other people might have, and

05:17.320 --> 05:21.800
I don't know, that'd be interesting. Well maybe, I mean, I don't know if we can duplicate names still, but

05:21.800 --> 05:25.320
as long as I can keep my old one I guess that's okay. Yeah.

05:25.320 --> 05:29.720
Even though I don't, you know, there's better names I would have liked, but oh well.

05:29.720 --> 05:33.320
Anyway, anything else you've been playing in your gameweek? Really, no.

05:33.320 --> 05:38.360
I've been just trying to play some of, I'm trying to, I have Shot of Colossus but I haven't

05:38.360 --> 05:40.200
gotten a chance to play it yet.

05:40.200 --> 05:44.400
And so I want to check that one out and maybe Tony Hawk's American Wasteland.

05:44.400 --> 05:47.480
But I haven't gotten a chance to play him yet.

05:47.480 --> 05:48.480
Real life?

05:48.480 --> 05:49.680
Um, yeah.

05:49.680 --> 05:52.480
Real life and just web page crap.

05:52.480 --> 05:53.480
Alright, alright.

05:53.480 --> 05:57.380
My Gaming Week actually has been pretty mellow.

05:57.380 --> 06:00.640
It's been mostly World of Warcraft, which I talked about on last week's show is, you

06:00.640 --> 06:03.920
You know, I went out and got it and it was this big, oh, I've got World of Warcraft.

06:03.920 --> 06:06.560
But I've been playing it and I've been giving it a fair chance and kind of checking it out

06:06.560 --> 06:07.560
and seeing what I think of it.

06:07.560 --> 06:10.900
And you know, I actually kind of like it.

06:10.900 --> 06:14.440
It's a lot better than I thought it would be because, you know, remember guys, I played

06:14.440 --> 06:18.140
Final Fantasy XI for like two years, so of course I hear nothing but smack talking about

06:18.140 --> 06:19.140
World of Warcraft.

06:19.140 --> 06:25.260
But one thing I'm learning about the MMOs as I'm playing World of Warcraft is it really

06:25.260 --> 06:28.840
is just a much different game than Final Fantasy XI.

06:28.840 --> 06:33.000
very different and it has a whole lot of different things to offer and it's not

06:33.000 --> 06:38.040
necessarily better or worse it's just that even though World of Warcraft and

06:38.040 --> 06:40.980
Final Fantasy 11 and let's say let's take some of the other big ones too

06:40.980 --> 06:45.440
Guild Wars and Ragnarok they're all MMOs but they've all got very very different

06:45.440 --> 06:48.680
things to offer and I think it really boils down to this if you're looking

06:48.680 --> 06:52.880
into getting into MMOs if you don't like MMOs you're not gonna like Final Fantasy

06:52.880 --> 06:57.160
11 or World of Warcraft either the I think the easiest accessible one to

06:57.160 --> 07:00.760
somebody who doesn't like MMOs at all, although I don't know why you'd be considering buying

07:00.760 --> 07:05.520
an MMO, probably Guild Wars, because Guild Wars is practically set up so that you don't

07:05.520 --> 07:09.800
even have to ever play with anybody, and you don't play a monthly fee with Guild Wars.

07:09.800 --> 07:13.040
Not that I think Guild Wars is necessarily the strongest game, nor is it my favorite

07:13.040 --> 07:21.440
out of the three, but I think it's probably the most accessible and most, like, non-shocking

07:21.440 --> 07:25.340
the game is kind of set up very similar to a single player experience, if you want it

07:25.340 --> 07:26.860
to be.

07:26.860 --> 07:30.780
But as far as Final Fantasy XI and World of Warcraft, I'm just noticing it is very true

07:30.780 --> 07:32.100
what they say.

07:32.100 --> 07:35.480
World of Warcraft is a game that you don't have to play with other people.

07:35.480 --> 07:39.700
You can play with it by yourself, except I am learning that it's a lot better to play

07:39.700 --> 07:43.140
with other people and there's more quests you can do and things that you do with other

07:43.140 --> 07:44.140
people.

07:44.140 --> 07:48.580
But I still feel that Final Fantasy XI is probably the more social game.

07:48.580 --> 07:52.900
If you're looking for a game that you want to do some role play in or you just want to

08:22.900 --> 08:26.740
already have it. I'm really a late bloomer when it comes to this game just because I've

08:26.740 --> 08:32.080
been focused on one MMO for so long. But if you have an interest in the game and you think

08:32.080 --> 08:37.620
it sounds like something you'd like, check it out. I think you'll find it's really different

08:37.620 --> 08:40.740
than the other MMOs out there except for Guild Wars because Guild Wars and World of Warcraft

08:40.740 --> 08:45.700
have a lot in common. They really do, just in the game, the way it plays. To me, it feels

08:45.700 --> 08:51.680
very similar. I think World of Warcraft has a lot more than Guild Wars, about 40 more

08:51.680 --> 08:56.200
levels for one, and more crafting and stuff you can do that I think makes it a little

08:56.200 --> 09:01.440
more... longer gameplay than Guild Wars would be.

09:01.440 --> 09:07.520
So I haven't played Final Fantasy yet again. Still waiting for that time to come in, but

09:07.520 --> 09:08.760
it's not there.

09:08.760 --> 09:13.160
I'm just on a cool off period from Final Fantasy XI for a little while myself. I need to just

09:13.160 --> 09:17.420
take a step back. I'm not saying I dislike the game at all. I still think it's an awesome

09:17.420 --> 09:22.320
game and I love it a lot and I'll probably get back into it once the 360 and Treasures

09:22.320 --> 09:26.520
of Autoregan expansions kind of pump some new blood into the game.

09:26.520 --> 09:30.220
By that time I'll probably be burned out of World of Warcraft so it works out.

09:30.220 --> 09:37.500
Yeah, my only thing is hopefully that they're going to have the Final Fantasy XI version

09:37.500 --> 09:40.660
for the 360 is going to be on the same surface as everyone else.

09:40.660 --> 09:41.660
Hoping.

09:41.660 --> 09:43.180
I don't know if it is.

09:43.180 --> 09:44.180
I'm not sure if it is.

09:44.180 --> 09:47.060
Well, you know, I heard it's not going to support the voice chat because the voice chat

09:47.060 --> 09:51.060
is going to be unmoderated, which doesn't make sense to me because...

09:51.060 --> 09:54.620
Oh, I wouldn't want voice chat anyways.

09:54.620 --> 09:56.700
Imagine Final Fantasy XI voice chat.

09:56.700 --> 09:57.700
I've done it.

09:57.700 --> 10:03.460
Team speak or Ventrilo are one of those things.

10:03.460 --> 10:07.060
That works fine when you have a group of people, but what if you have the world?

10:07.060 --> 10:08.060
No, thank you.

10:08.060 --> 10:09.060
Okay, I got you.

10:09.060 --> 10:13.140
But, no, the whole thing is I just hope it's supported, period, because then that way I

10:13.140 --> 10:17.660
can cancel my Play Online account, just move it all over the Xbox Live.

10:17.660 --> 10:21.100
I have this feeling it's going to be set up like PSO where you have to pay for both, and

10:21.100 --> 10:25.460
that's going to be sad. With Phantasy Star Online on Xbox, you have to pay not just the

10:25.460 --> 10:29.580
Xbox Live, but then you pay the Sega fee of like $8 as well. Sucks.

10:29.580 --> 10:31.580
Well, still they're going to have a break, I'm sure.

10:31.580 --> 10:32.940
Yeah, we'll see.

10:32.940 --> 10:33.940
I hope so. I hope so.

10:33.940 --> 10:38.740
All right, let's get into some gaming news tonight, talk about some things going on in

10:38.740 --> 10:45.640
gaming world. Speaking of the Xbox 360, Wal-Mart and EB Games and some other stores are starting

10:45.640 --> 10:51.740
to get the little Xbox 360 kiosks. I havenít seen any show up, but there are some websites

10:51.740 --> 10:56.340
set up that you can just go on to some of the major gaming portals. You can probably

10:56.340 --> 11:00.460
find some websites that have these lists set up of where all these gaming kiosks are.

11:00.460 --> 11:04.020
They have lists. They even have a Google Map thing thatís set up for it.

11:04.020 --> 11:06.980
But honestly, chances are itís going to be in the mall near you at some point.

11:06.980 --> 11:11.820
They're going to be rolled out to almost every store in over three weeks.

11:11.820 --> 11:13.540
They're shipping them out right now.

11:13.540 --> 11:15.560
Obviously Microsoft's pushing this thing like crazy.

11:15.560 --> 11:19.580
It's going to be in your local store soon enough, but if you just have to be first,

11:19.580 --> 11:20.580
get on the internet and look.

11:20.580 --> 11:24.380
I checked our local Walmart today because I just happened to be there, and no, they

11:24.380 --> 11:25.380
didn't have them.

11:25.380 --> 11:26.860
I'm not a big Walmart fan myself.

11:26.860 --> 11:29.180
I'm more of a Target guy.

11:29.180 --> 11:35.540
It's only a couple of demos, and honestly this is coming out in a few weeks anyways.

11:35.540 --> 11:36.540
I can wait.

12:06.540 --> 12:10.740
Let's talk a little bit about the PSP, which has shipped 10 million units.

12:10.740 --> 12:14.580
That's what officials from Sony are announcing, that they have reached 10 million units, of

12:14.580 --> 12:22.980
course, this being worldwide, 183 PSP software titles currently out, a total of 19.6 million

12:22.980 --> 12:27.020
units of software shipped, and then 15 million UMD movies.

12:27.020 --> 12:31.500
That's kind of crazy because that means almost just as many UMD movies have shipped as games.

12:31.500 --> 12:32.500
Yeah.

12:32.500 --> 12:37.140
And you know what's also crazy about it, if 10 million PSPs have shipped, then that means

12:37.140 --> 12:43.180
like most people only own like one game.

12:43.180 --> 12:44.180
And probably it's Luminous.

12:44.180 --> 12:45.820
Probably one or two games.

12:45.820 --> 12:46.820
It's probably Luminous.

12:46.820 --> 12:47.820
Probably.

12:47.820 --> 12:49.860
Well, I don't know.

12:49.860 --> 12:50.860
Everybody I know, it's Luminous.

12:50.860 --> 12:52.700
And honestly, it is the best PSP game out there.

12:52.700 --> 12:55.140
I'm probably just unimpressed that the game's out right now like I am.

12:55.140 --> 13:00.380
I mean, it's just, I haven't bought it, I don't even remember the last PSP game I bought

13:00.380 --> 13:04.440
other than Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories, everything I've gotten has been passed down

13:04.440 --> 13:08.560
free from publishers and I wouldn't have even bought them if they hadn't given it to me

13:08.560 --> 13:10.560
because I'm just unimpressed by everything that's coming out.

13:10.560 --> 13:14.480
There just hasn't really been a title that's been like, I have to really get that, and

13:14.480 --> 13:17.760
I'm kind of seeing that in the new Katamari PSP. I'm like, oh, I definitely get that because

13:17.760 --> 13:22.800
I'm in the Katamari franchise, I'm into that. But we have yet to see a really solid franchise

13:22.800 --> 13:28.160
game hit the PSP. I mean, granted, we've had Burnout and we've had Wipeout, I guess, and

13:28.160 --> 13:32.200
We've had Metal Gear, but not really the same Metal Gear.

13:32.200 --> 13:37.480
We've had some to extend the franchise, but we've really just had no solid franchise title

13:37.480 --> 13:38.480
hit the PSP.

13:38.480 --> 13:39.480
You know what I mean?

13:39.480 --> 13:40.480
I think that's kind of what's hurting it.

13:40.480 --> 13:43.560
Whereas on the DS, now you're getting like Castlevania, and it's seriously probably the

13:43.560 --> 13:46.280
best Castlevania game they've done since Symphony of the Night.

13:46.280 --> 13:50.400
So you know, DS is starting to look really good with the franchises.

13:50.400 --> 13:51.400
Mario Kart?

13:51.400 --> 13:53.600
Yeah, Mario Kart on the way, and Animal Crossing.

13:53.600 --> 13:56.120
The whole internet connectivity stuff?

13:56.120 --> 13:57.120
Yeah.

13:57.120 --> 14:03.760
I know PSP has its loyalists out there, though.

14:03.760 --> 14:07.960
If you have any emails, comments, or suggestions, you know I send us an email to go at orange

14:07.960 --> 14:08.960
lounge radio dot com.

14:08.960 --> 14:11.760
Maybe you're a PSP lover wanting to yell at us a little bit.

14:11.760 --> 14:13.280
I don't dislike the PSP.

14:13.280 --> 14:17.520
I think the PSP is a great multi-system, like getting to watch them, and you know that's

14:17.520 --> 14:21.640
really what they're marketing it as, so on that end, it's successful that you can watch

14:21.640 --> 14:22.640
movies.

14:22.640 --> 14:23.640
I'm not talking about the PSP either.

14:23.640 --> 14:26.760
I've got two of them, so obviously I love them, but it's just...

14:26.760 --> 14:30.760
I love the fact that it's got the wireless Internet now, and you can download our show

14:30.760 --> 14:31.760
on it.

14:31.760 --> 14:37.960
It's great for that, but the games element alone, a little weak, a little weak.

14:37.960 --> 14:41.520
When you see a game like Twisted Metal, you're thinking, ooh, Twisted Metal Black, that was

14:41.520 --> 14:42.520
an awesome game.

14:42.520 --> 14:48.240
Oh, wait, this is a port of Twisted Metal 2, a PlayStation game, oh, crap, Twisted Metal

14:48.240 --> 14:49.720
for the PS3.

14:49.720 --> 14:54.600
I know there's going to be one, that's going to be awesome.

14:54.600 --> 14:58.600
the email box. DarkSakura is our mailbox queen, but she's not here tonight, unfortunately,

14:58.600 --> 15:01.960
so we're going to go ahead and table the mailbox until next week, but definitely get your emails

15:01.960 --> 15:02.960
in togo.orangelandradio.com.

15:02.960 --> 15:07.880
I was talking a little bit about World of Warcraft earlier. You know there's an expansion

15:07.880 --> 15:13.120
on the horizon, and of course, people love to gossip about the expansion packs. Here's

15:13.120 --> 15:17.360
the latest rumors circulating around the Internet. We don't know how true they are, but they

15:17.360 --> 15:22.920
seem to be pretty solid leads. The Burning Crusade sounds like it's going to be the name

15:22.920 --> 15:25.100
of it and it's going to take place in the Outlands.

15:25.100 --> 15:27.980
They're going to raise the level cap with this expansion to 70.

15:27.980 --> 15:31.600
Some sites are saying 75, but most are saying 70.

15:31.600 --> 15:32.920
It's going to have two new races.

15:32.920 --> 15:36.920
The Blood Elf will belong to the Horde and to be announced for the Alliance.

15:36.920 --> 15:39.360
However, no new classes at this time.

15:39.360 --> 15:40.600
Again, these are all rumors.

15:40.600 --> 15:41.920
Things might change.

15:41.920 --> 15:45.000
Blizzard will make the official announcement any day now, I'm sure.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.200
BlizzCon, is BlizzCon this weekend?

15:47.200 --> 15:49.280
Was it this weekend or it's coming up next weekend?

15:49.280 --> 15:50.280
I don't know.

15:50.280 --> 15:51.280
I have no idea.

15:51.280 --> 15:55.840
don't have time off work to go to these things, unfortunately, I would love to if I could.

15:55.840 --> 15:58.280
Maybe next year, because I'm just now getting into World of Warcraft, maybe next year I'll

15:58.280 --> 15:59.280
be ready for Blizzcon.

15:59.280 --> 16:03.320
Anyway, they might do some small upgrades to the graphic engine as well, and they're

16:03.320 --> 16:05.280
going to add weather effects, which I think is neat.

16:05.280 --> 16:09.700
And then the other thing I think is neat, cross-server battlegrounds?

16:09.700 --> 16:10.700
So we'll see.

16:10.700 --> 16:15.000
Well, I actually, I was reading, because I was reading an article about this earlier,

16:15.000 --> 16:19.640
and they were talking about some of the stuff that they're going to be having, and I could

16:19.640 --> 16:27.600
was sworn they actually did name the, yeah, for Alliance it's Draenei or something like

16:27.600 --> 16:28.600
that.

16:28.600 --> 16:31.760
It's D-R-A-E-N-E-I is the race for the Alliance.

16:31.760 --> 16:37.200
They have a new class, I guess Spellbreaker, they said, they're rumored saying it's going

16:37.200 --> 16:43.040
to be race 275, six new areas and nine new high-end instances.

16:43.040 --> 16:45.840
So it really just depends on what website you're looking at because everybody's reporting

16:45.840 --> 16:49.460
something different at this point, but it seems okay, there's going to be a level cap

16:49.460 --> 16:54.100
Some little things it looks like.

16:54.100 --> 16:56.700
You know the other big rumor going around about World of Warcraft right now is that

16:56.700 --> 17:00.020
it's going to go on to 360.

17:00.020 --> 17:03.500
I'm certain Microsoft is really, really hoping for that because let's face it, World of Warcraft

17:03.500 --> 17:08.060
right now is a PC only title and not everybody who is in the console is into PC.

17:08.060 --> 17:09.060
I like both.

17:09.060 --> 17:12.900
In fact, with Civilization 4 coming out this week, this is going to be a big month for

17:12.900 --> 17:17.220
PC gaming for me.

17:17.220 --> 17:22.420
folks that don't really cross those lines. They're a PC gamer or they're a console

17:22.420 --> 17:26.860
gamer so if World of Warcraft came out on the 360 or any next-gen console

17:26.860 --> 17:30.640
really that would be huge so I'd like to see it happen I think it would be good

17:30.640 --> 17:37.320
news but who knows. So surely you've been following the drama and I'm sure anybody

17:37.320 --> 17:40.420
who listens to this show probably has been following this too so I don't want

17:40.420 --> 17:46.240
to beat a dead horse with this but Penny Arcade versus Jack Thompson oh my god

17:46.240 --> 17:50.840
It's like we're watching Mortal Kombat seriously like what what happened here? We got we got a letter

17:50.840 --> 17:55.620
I mean, I'm totally paraphrasing here, and I'm just going off memory because there's been so many news articles

17:55.620 --> 17:58.340
I don't even remember anymore, but like Penny Arcade

17:59.120 --> 18:04.880
Donated $10,000 because Jack Thompson was like haha. Just kidding about the you know the mod thing

18:04.880 --> 18:07.720
He said he was going to donate or he was going to give $10,000 whoever did it

18:07.720 --> 18:12.400
And then he said it was a joke and Penny Arcade put up the $10,000 because Jack Thompson wouldn't do it

18:12.400 --> 18:13.400
it.

18:13.400 --> 18:17.200
And then Jack Thompson basically wrote a letter to the police saying that the penny arcade

18:17.200 --> 18:19.040
people are harassing him.

18:19.040 --> 18:24.120
And then the penny arcade people filed something with like a legal association to get Jack

18:24.120 --> 18:25.120
Thompson investigated.

18:25.120 --> 18:28.740
No, what they were doing is they were actually, they sent a letter.

18:28.740 --> 18:31.320
I'm completely paraphrasing here.

18:31.320 --> 18:35.000
They sent letters to the Florida bar basically.

18:35.000 --> 18:38.760
So Jack Thompson now turns around and files a complaint with the feds and the district

18:38.760 --> 18:41.880
attorney and the rumor is he was calling for a truce.

18:41.880 --> 18:48.080
Well, yeah, he's all over the place and he's emailing the Feds and stuff like this and

18:48.080 --> 18:49.080
all his information.

18:49.080 --> 18:53.840
I mean, if anybody actually, because anybody's going to do research on this and be like,

18:53.840 --> 18:58.680
oh my God, you know, he's completely nuts because everything he's stating is completely

18:58.680 --> 18:59.680
wrong.

18:59.680 --> 19:05.000
So, I mean, anybody who does any research on this and doesn't take them for face value

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
is obviously going to see.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.880
He's good at getting publicity, though, because even we're talking about him.

19:08.880 --> 19:09.880
Maybe we shouldn't be.

19:09.880 --> 19:10.880
I don't know.

19:10.880 --> 19:16.840
No, we've got to point out that he's stupid. You've got to point out the retarded people.

19:16.840 --> 19:25.840
I have to say, there seems to be a lot of politicians coming from Florida that are just

19:25.840 --> 19:26.840
retarded.

19:26.840 --> 19:30.500
Well, let's not go there because we don't want to get more hate mail from our friends

19:30.500 --> 19:31.500
in Florida.

19:31.500 --> 19:32.500
Politicians!

19:32.500 --> 19:33.500
I know, just politicians.

19:33.500 --> 19:45.500
Anyway, if I could offer words of advice to Penny Arcade, finish him.

19:45.500 --> 19:52.680
Honestly, just let him dig himself his own grave, because it's going to happen.

19:52.680 --> 19:58.800
He's just going to eventually get caught up in so many lies that he'll be over.

19:58.800 --> 20:01.400
I have just a small little story on Civilization 4.

20:01.400 --> 20:05.400
coming out this week, October 25th, and I want to buy this and check it out.

20:05.400 --> 20:06.400
You know, I didn't...

20:06.400 --> 20:10.360
I loved Civilization I, love Civilization I, I know I've gone off on a previous podcast

20:10.360 --> 20:14.080
about how I think it's probably one of my favorite games of all time, if not my favorite

20:14.080 --> 20:17.440
game of all time, is Civilization I, but I never really got into 2 or 3.

20:17.440 --> 20:23.960
It just didn't have that simpleness, that accessibility of Civilization I, but Civ IV

20:23.960 --> 20:26.800
is on the horizon and I'm just excited to at least check it out and see if I like it,

20:26.800 --> 20:30.200
and I hear it's going to be really customizable and all this stuff, so it's coming out this

20:30.200 --> 20:36.280
this week, and I'm curious about it. I wish I could rent PC games or something, because

20:36.280 --> 20:40.720
I don't want to have to spend $49.99 on it, but it looks like I'm going to have to, so

20:40.720 --> 20:44.680
we'll see. I know, I'm like, ah, oh well, we'll see.

20:44.680 --> 20:48.040
Anyway, Loki, what do you have for us tonight? You got some news stories for us?

20:48.040 --> 20:53.960
Yeah, a couple things to touch on here. The first one everybody's talking about, because

20:53.960 --> 20:57.880
with the 360 coming up, what are the launch dates for these games that are coming out?

20:57.880 --> 21:02.000
We have, what is it, Best Buy saying, oh yeah, we're going to have the games before they

21:02.000 --> 21:03.000
launch.

21:03.000 --> 21:07.160
Well, yeah, I doubt because everybody's releasing their games before the system launches.

21:07.160 --> 21:11.000
I don't understand the lure of buying games before the system is out anyway.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.400
Oh, I'm going to go home and look at the pretty packaging in the book.

21:13.400 --> 21:16.480
Is it just to make the lines go faster when the system comes out?

21:16.480 --> 21:17.480
I don't know.

21:17.480 --> 21:18.480
I don't get it.

21:18.480 --> 21:19.480
I think so.

21:19.480 --> 21:22.300
Or just so there's not a huge rush on everything.

21:22.300 --> 21:27.800
I'm getting my games before they come out just because I just want to pick everything

21:27.800 --> 21:31.060
up when I get it, and then I'll have the system.

21:31.060 --> 21:35.520
You guys know I didn't reserve my system, so I'm going to be playing the Rush the Crowds

21:35.520 --> 21:36.520
game.

21:36.520 --> 21:39.560
I did it with the DS and I did it with other systems in the past.

21:39.560 --> 21:41.800
I'll do it with Xbox 360 as well.

21:41.800 --> 21:45.600
The whole rumor is that they've been playing up the fact that they're in their oversold

21:45.600 --> 21:46.600
line.

21:46.600 --> 21:47.600
Big shock!

21:47.600 --> 21:49.160
Every company says they're oversold when their systems come out.

21:49.160 --> 21:53.560
saying that that was artificial to increase demand on the system or something like that

21:53.560 --> 21:55.360
but what do we know?

21:55.360 --> 21:59.280
What was that countdown thing you were blogging about earlier this week? There was a countdown

21:59.280 --> 22:01.160
on the Xbox 360?

22:01.160 --> 22:02.160
Hex 168.

22:02.160 --> 22:03.840
Yeah, you talked about it last podcast.

22:03.840 --> 22:08.480
Hex 168 is actually this kind of, it's like almost like the origin site for, you know,

22:08.480 --> 22:14.440
the people in the U.S. The thing is though, you can win an Xbox system, the three Microsoft

22:14.440 --> 22:20.880
games, Project Gotham Racing, Cameo, and Perfect Dark, you can win that and a year of Xbox

22:20.880 --> 22:22.560
Live.

22:22.560 --> 22:28.440
What you have to do though is you have to create a short video clip or like a Photoshop

22:28.440 --> 22:37.320
of the Hex 168 logo like you saw it somewhere, you know, like you have to send them pictures.

22:37.320 --> 22:41.380
So you have to get creative, you know, doing something like, you know, in California they

22:41.380 --> 22:44.680
have the lottery you know the mega lottery or whatever it is and they have

22:44.680 --> 22:49.000
you know that it looks like a home video camera footage of this giant ticket

22:49.000 --> 22:52.000
flying through the air now something like that you know you have to make so

22:52.000 --> 22:56.520
it's like way too late so basically the UK people they get to just sign up and

22:56.520 --> 23:00.480
enter the drawing but no we have to actually work for it and you don't want

23:00.480 --> 23:04.200
to say that the hand thing with the DS yeah it's like that they'd mail you a

23:04.200 --> 23:08.320
hand you take a picture for touching is good oh I don't know it's gonna remind

23:08.320 --> 23:15.320
It's another thing to give away more 360's and the win I guess you win a trip to the

23:15.940 --> 23:17.600
pre-release party or something like that.

23:17.600 --> 23:19.020
Hey not bad.

23:19.020 --> 23:26.020
But ehh, that's what I had to say. Eh I have it paid for, don't care.

23:27.540 --> 23:31.040
I want to mention this and we'll go back to Loki for some more stories. Do you have more stories?

23:31.040 --> 23:31.380
I'm sure I do.

23:31.380 --> 23:36.320
Alright let me get this out first. Even though it's not necessarily gaming specific with

23:36.320 --> 23:43.320
The Senate Commerce Committee made a bill this week that says that in 2009, all transmissions

23:43.320 --> 23:46.620
will have to be digital, television transmissions.

23:46.620 --> 23:51.180
So it looks like HD is going to be the big thing in 2009 at the latest.

23:51.180 --> 23:57.400
Of course, they will be also doing the subsidization or something in the amount of $3 billion to

23:57.400 --> 24:01.880
help folks that are having a hard time getting a new TV kind of get cheap converters for

24:01.880 --> 24:05.640
their old TVs to get the HD signals, it should be interesting.

24:05.640 --> 24:09.080
Of course, that means HDTVs will get cheaper.

24:09.080 --> 24:11.320
They've been getting cheaper and cheaper for the past few years.

24:11.320 --> 24:16.040
I paid $600 for my HDTV, which is only 30 inch, but it's not bad.

24:16.040 --> 24:17.040
It's a great TV.

24:17.040 --> 24:18.400
I love it.

24:18.400 --> 24:20.120
They're just going to get cheaper as the years go on.

24:20.120 --> 24:23.360
By the time 2009 rolls around, it won't be a big deal.

24:23.360 --> 24:24.360
Think about this.

24:24.360 --> 24:27.960
If your console life is five years, which it seems like most consoles have been lasting

24:27.960 --> 24:35.000
about five years on the market, that means that these consoles will need to be ready

24:35.000 --> 24:42.040
for this in 2009 and it sounds like the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360 are both HD ready but is

24:42.040 --> 24:43.840
Nintendo listening to this?

24:43.840 --> 24:49.320
I hope so because they said the revolution wouldn't support HDTV and that makes me sad

24:49.320 --> 24:53.720
so I hope they will reconsider in light of this bill because by the end of the console

24:53.720 --> 24:58.120
life of the revolution, they're going to be in trouble but I don't think they're going

24:58.120 --> 24:59.120
to be in trouble.

24:59.120 --> 25:02.040
They won't necessarily be in trouble but they won't be as cool.

25:02.040 --> 25:04.880
I think we still haven't heard everything about the revolution yet.

25:04.880 --> 25:05.880
Yeah, I know.

25:05.880 --> 25:09.240
I know there's still a lot to come, but the whole HD thing stills...

25:09.240 --> 25:13.480
I want somebody to come out and say Nintendo Revolution will support HDTV and then I will

25:13.480 --> 25:16.480
shut my mouth.

25:16.480 --> 25:19.740
You know I'm going to buy it no matter what, because I'm going to want to play whatever

25:19.740 --> 25:23.640
Zelda game and whatever Metroid game or whatever Mario game they put out on it, because I'm

25:23.640 --> 25:25.240
a consumer whore like that.

25:25.240 --> 25:26.240
I know.

25:26.240 --> 25:27.240
Yeah.

25:27.240 --> 25:31.280
Alright, what else you got?

25:31.280 --> 25:35.280
I got this funny site, I was just looking up here.

25:35.280 --> 25:43.180
This Chinese site actually was spoofing Nintendogs and they have Nintendirls.

25:43.180 --> 25:46.520
It says College Girls and Friends.

25:46.520 --> 25:48.640
I went and pulled it up and...

25:48.640 --> 25:52.440
Do you take the girls out for a walk and you have to clean up their poop?

25:52.440 --> 25:53.440
Not quite.

25:53.440 --> 25:55.040
It looks like a dating sim type thing.

25:55.040 --> 25:56.600
I think this is actually all photoshopped.

25:56.600 --> 26:00.120
Oh God, it sprung too!

26:00.120 --> 26:04.680
It's a funny idea, however, they're never going to go in that market because they're

26:04.680 --> 26:05.680
too family friendly.

26:05.680 --> 26:07.680
Somebody was very, very bored.

26:07.680 --> 26:09.720
Very bored and very horny, I guess.

26:09.720 --> 26:13.640
Whoever made it in Ten Girls, go outside, seriously.

26:13.640 --> 26:16.640
We don't have an advice column tonight because Dark Sakura's not here, but that's my advice.

26:16.640 --> 26:18.800
If this is you, go outside, please.

26:18.800 --> 26:19.800
Seriously.

26:19.800 --> 26:20.800
Get some fresh air.

26:20.800 --> 26:27.880
The other thing is, Famitsu Magazine put up some pictures of Final Fantasy XII.

26:27.880 --> 26:31.680
Which we will be referring to from now on as the sexy Final Fantasy XII.

26:31.680 --> 26:32.680
Just kidding.

26:32.680 --> 26:33.680
Okay.

26:33.680 --> 26:36.800
Yeah, you have to admit, the screenshots are sexy.

26:36.800 --> 26:41.800
They are pretty sexy, but to me it looks like console version of XI, to be honest.

26:41.800 --> 26:44.160
I mean, it's got the same characters.

26:44.160 --> 26:47.240
Did you play the demo at E3 a couple years ago when they were actually demoing it?

26:47.240 --> 26:51.640
I mean, lord knows what's changed in the past two years, but the battle system felt like

26:51.640 --> 26:55.960
a fusion of Final Fantasy XI and the old school Final Fantasies, but I don't know, in the

26:55.960 --> 26:59.360
past couple years, they might have changed that. I don't know. It's hard to tell anymore.

26:59.360 --> 27:05.480
They'll probably show it next year, too. It's going to be like the new Halo 2 of E3. They'll

27:05.480 --> 27:08.400
show it like three years in a row without the damn game coming out.

27:08.400 --> 27:13.560
Well, you know. I mean, Dragon Quest VIII is coming around the corner here pretty soon.

27:13.560 --> 27:14.760
You're supposed to have that demo packed in.

27:14.760 --> 27:21.520
Yes, it is. So, that would be something to check out. Except, I have my whole qualms

27:21.520 --> 27:27.480
with Dragon Quest VIII looking exactly like Dragon Ball Z. Granted, I know it's the same

27:27.480 --> 27:34.920
artist, but come on. It looks exactly the same. It's just, no. It's like Dragon Ball

27:34.920 --> 27:42.320
Z. It even has Dragon in the name. It's wrong. It's very wrong. Yeah, I don't really have

27:42.320 --> 27:47.000
much. All right, that's all right. I was looking at a story very briefly. It talks about Japan

27:47.000 --> 27:51.440
reconsidering the game ratings. They may adopt some stricter standards for 18 plus

27:51.440 --> 27:55.080
I wonder if that's a paranoia over in this country starting to set in over there.

27:55.080 --> 27:58.760
There was basically like an event that happened.

27:58.760 --> 28:03.380
It was like a gathering of top industry players and they had a session and the topic was video

28:03.380 --> 28:06.840
games and their effects on the youth.

28:06.840 --> 28:10.360
In a proposal by government representatives, which was kind of similar to what was going

28:10.360 --> 28:16.180
on here, they put forward an initiative that said that there would be a distinct indication

28:16.180 --> 28:26.820
of games contents on the packaging to change the CERO18 rating to something that is recommended

28:26.820 --> 28:30.820
for 18 and over to prohibited for under 18.

28:30.820 --> 28:36.460
So then they came out and these companies got together and it sounds like Square Enix

28:36.460 --> 28:41.980
president Yoichi Wada actually told the group that there was still a need for more studies

28:41.980 --> 28:45.060
to be done on the games influence of children.

29:15.060 --> 29:18.420
as its games. Yes, and what games are on the Gizmondo?

29:18.420 --> 29:22.980
The Gizmondo, they've got SSX3, last year's version of SSX,

29:22.980 --> 29:26.260
and I believe FIFA 2005,

29:26.260 --> 29:29.540
last year's version of that Sticky Balls,

29:29.540 --> 29:33.060
which, whatever the hell that is. Doesn't sound like something I want to be walking to the

29:33.060 --> 29:33.660
camera with?

29:33.660 --> 29:36.780
The other bad things about the Gizmondo,

29:36.780 --> 29:40.420
when you turn it on, it takes 40 seconds to boot.

29:40.420 --> 29:44.140
The other thing is,

29:44.140 --> 29:48.340
In order to turn it off, you have to actually go through this menu, almost like Windows,

29:48.340 --> 29:49.980
and you have to hit shutdown.

29:49.980 --> 29:54.700
The other thing though is it's available in two versions, one for $2.29, which is being

29:54.700 --> 29:55.700
sold right now.

29:55.700 --> 29:59.860
Then they're going to have the premium version, which is selling for $3.39.

29:59.860 --> 30:07.180
The $2.29 version, you get ads sent to your Gizmondo, and in order to shut off your Gizmondo,

30:07.180 --> 30:11.120
you have to watch the three ads each day.

30:11.120 --> 30:16.760
And for the 3.39 version, you don't get ads, so...

30:16.760 --> 30:17.840
That's the truth?

30:17.840 --> 30:20.400
That's a real truth about the system?

30:20.400 --> 30:23.360
One of the reviews said that.

30:23.360 --> 30:26.640
If that is for real, then this...

30:26.640 --> 30:30.260
Yeah, I'm lost for words.

30:30.260 --> 30:34.240
It seemed like an interesting idea at E3 and it has quickly become...

30:34.240 --> 30:39.080
If that is true, I may proclaim this thing the worst gaming system of the past several

30:39.080 --> 30:40.080
years.

30:40.080 --> 30:45.240
I don't know, there's another system out there that really does want that title and that

30:45.240 --> 30:46.240
would be the N-Gage.

30:46.240 --> 30:47.240
Oh shit, yeah.

30:47.240 --> 30:48.240
That's a tough call.

30:48.240 --> 30:53.880
I'm afraid to say, even with the 40 second load, the N-Gage won't frickin' show you

30:53.880 --> 30:55.600
ads when you shut it down, though.

30:55.600 --> 31:00.860
It's funny though, they said that one way you could bypass those is pull out the batteries,

31:00.860 --> 31:01.860
but you know.

31:01.860 --> 31:02.860
That's so stupid.

31:02.860 --> 31:08.440
Why would you pay $3.39 for the system anyways?

31:08.440 --> 31:14.460
I could have this really crappy handheld system or I could get a 360, get a PSP, get any other

31:14.460 --> 31:17.380
system out there on the market.

31:17.380 --> 31:20.080
Nice knowing you Gizmondo, nice knowing you.

31:20.080 --> 31:24.040
Follow up to something we were talking about last week, Children of Mana on the DS.

31:24.040 --> 31:27.600
Of course, Famitsu magazine once again spilling the beans on what's going on with Children

31:27.600 --> 31:29.120
of Mana.

31:29.120 --> 31:40.000
It's going to be very similar to the previous Zelda games, Zelda style Secret Amano games.

31:40.000 --> 31:44.920
It's going to be about 25 to 30 hours of gameplay plus side quests to keep things going longer.

31:44.920 --> 31:49.200
What's also interesting about this, it's going to have a big anime opening sequence.

31:49.200 --> 31:52.520
For those of you guys that have Castlevania DS and saw the big anime opening sequence,

31:52.520 --> 31:55.000
they're going to have something like that in Children of Mana, which was kind of cool

31:55.000 --> 31:57.320
as well.

31:57.320 --> 32:01.280
Depending on the character that you're doing, you will be able to do different actions with

32:01.280 --> 32:02.280
your weapon.

32:02.280 --> 32:07.140
So if you play as Frick, you can block incoming attacks with like a guard and you can cut

32:07.140 --> 32:09.160
grass and stuff.

32:09.160 --> 32:13.480
And then Pop, the character, has a flail, but it has a really large attack range and

32:13.480 --> 32:16.760
can kind of do like a boomerang thing and get long distance items.

32:16.760 --> 32:20.960
And then there's another character, Tumble, and you can stun enemies from a long range

32:20.960 --> 32:21.960
with arrows.

32:21.960 --> 32:25.820
And there's also going to be a Fever Gauge that will build up as you attack enemies.

32:25.820 --> 32:29.880
it's full, you do a super attack that's unique for each weapon. Why they're calling it a

32:29.880 --> 32:34.480
fever gauge and not a limit break, which it just sounds the same damn thing as, I'm not

32:34.480 --> 32:39.720
sure. Whatever, that's cool. Sounds like it'll be pretty cool. I'll definitely want to check

32:39.720 --> 32:45.620
that out. And you know we love to talk about video games that are being made into movies.

32:45.620 --> 32:50.740
Oh yeah, usually most of them. Did you go see Doom this weekend? Not yet. I have plans

32:50.740 --> 32:52.860
to go see it no matter how bad it is.

32:52.860 --> 32:55.820
I will not probably see this.

32:55.820 --> 32:56.820
I like Doom.

32:56.820 --> 32:57.820
I respect Doom.

32:57.820 --> 32:58.820
It's a series.

32:58.820 --> 32:59.820
I like Doom 3.

32:59.820 --> 33:00.820
I thought it was cool.

33:00.820 --> 33:01.820
It's a popcorn movie.

33:01.820 --> 33:02.820
I didn't need the movie.

33:02.820 --> 33:04.220
It's a popcorn movie.

33:04.220 --> 33:10.540
People are looking for some great acting stuff.

33:10.540 --> 33:15.640
You're not going to find it in video game movies until some other actual well-directed

33:15.640 --> 33:16.640
ones come out.

33:16.640 --> 33:17.640
I understand that.

33:17.640 --> 33:23.400
like, I don't know, even Mortal Kombat had a halfway decent story, I suppose.

33:23.400 --> 33:30.400
I really don't understand how you can't make a good video game movie. It's not that

33:30.400 --> 33:35.360
different. Instead of taking the source materials from a book, a play, or something like that,

33:35.360 --> 33:39.560
you're taking it from a game. Big deal. I mean, I don't know why these people can't

33:39.560 --> 33:44.160
get it. They just want to do something special to pay homage to the game or do something

33:44.160 --> 33:50.880
you know, Quirky, don't try that. Do just normal movie stuff. You don't have to go crazy

33:50.880 --> 33:52.440
and do the first-person view for Doom.

33:52.440 --> 33:56.260
Yeah, that's really what sold me on the fact that Doom is going to be stupid, is the first-person

33:56.260 --> 33:57.260
thing.

33:57.260 --> 34:01.800
We get the fact that it was a first-person shooter game, but, you know, for, well, okay,

34:01.800 --> 34:05.980
well, Super Mario Bros. movie was bad, but, I mean, well, it's just, they didn't go like

34:05.980 --> 34:06.980
all pixelated shit.

34:06.980 --> 34:08.760
They didn't stomp on Goombas and stuff.

34:08.760 --> 34:13.400
Exactly. It's not retarded like that. But, of course, you know, Super Mario Bros. movie

34:13.400 --> 34:17.620
came out when they were making these really strange sci-fi movies, you know, like Waterworld

34:17.620 --> 34:23.000
and Judge Dredd and stuff. That was a whole other trend, but whatever.

34:23.000 --> 34:27.840
I still have high hopes for Silent Hill. There's like one little publicity photo out right

34:27.840 --> 34:31.920
now, which tells you nothing about the movie, but I have such high hopes for Silent Hill.

34:31.920 --> 34:34.560
I really hope they're doing that right. And Halo sounds like it might actually be pretty

34:34.560 --> 34:35.560
good, too. You never know.

34:35.560 --> 34:39.360
I think Peter Jackson behind it is a great idea.

34:39.360 --> 34:44.180
So there's some high hopes in 2006, or well I guess Halo will be more like 2007, but still.

34:44.180 --> 34:48.280
Well it's also another thing too is they're making it from a property that people know

34:48.280 --> 34:51.100
what it is instead of like Alone in the Dark.

34:51.100 --> 34:54.060
Most people haven't played Alone in the Dark, I mean it's a game that came out a long-ass

34:54.060 --> 34:58.740
time ago and House of the Dead, not many people have played House of the Dead.

34:58.740 --> 35:00.740
Dungeon Siege is probably the biggest title out of three.

35:00.740 --> 35:02.740
I've never played Dungeon Siege.

35:02.740 --> 35:06.400
Well of course that's another thing where it's like well are you a PC gamer or a console

35:06.400 --> 35:09.680
gamer because I think if you talk to more PC gamers, probably a lot of them have played

35:09.680 --> 35:16.000
Dungeon Siege. I've played Dungeon Siege. It's Diablo, which I'm sure is very insulting

35:16.000 --> 35:20.000
to some Dungeon Siege fans out there, but that was my reaction when I played it. I was

35:20.000 --> 35:22.040
like, oh, it's Diablo by Microsoft.

35:22.040 --> 35:27.040
Halo, it could be good. I mean, the premise is simple. Doom, the premise was simple, but

35:27.040 --> 35:28.880
no.

35:28.880 --> 35:33.680
Almost too simple. I would have rather seen them do a Duke Nukem movie than a Doom.

35:33.680 --> 35:34.920
Duke Nukem would be badass.

35:34.920 --> 35:39.760
Well, anyway, before we get on that tangent, we're going to talk about Hitman.

35:39.760 --> 35:40.760
It's going to be coming up.

35:40.760 --> 35:43.520
Vin Diesel is going to be starring in this film.

35:43.520 --> 35:44.520
It should be interesting.

35:44.520 --> 35:45.960
The director has been named.

35:45.960 --> 35:53.080
It is Skip Woods who directed a movie Thursday, and maybe another movie that a lot of nerds

35:53.080 --> 35:54.080
seem to like, Swordfish.

35:54.080 --> 35:56.080
Swordfish was fucking badass.

35:56.080 --> 36:00.400
So maybe there's hope for Hitman, but I'm not a Vin Diesel fan.

36:00.400 --> 36:03.800
I'm a fan of Swordfish, though.

36:03.800 --> 36:07.120
That movie basically said, I'm going to kick your ass at the very beginning of the movie

36:07.120 --> 36:08.120
and I did that.

36:08.120 --> 36:09.120
It was awesome.

36:09.120 --> 36:10.960
I saw like half of it.

36:10.960 --> 36:13.100
It was a great movie.

36:13.100 --> 36:18.520
The whole movie was just the villain winning and that was the best part of the whole movie.

36:18.520 --> 36:21.200
Alright, no more stories from you, Logie?

36:21.200 --> 36:23.240
Well, I got a couple things about the PSP.

36:23.240 --> 36:24.240
Sure, what's up?

36:24.240 --> 36:25.240
Homebrew stuff.

36:25.240 --> 36:27.320
The first being that there's a game coming out.

36:27.320 --> 36:32.280
It's supposed to be released, I believe in December, DJ Max.

36:32.280 --> 36:37.040
are fans of the music gaming stuff. It's like BeatMania. It's actually an online game right

36:37.040 --> 36:42.180
now. It's Korean. Basically, music gaming over the internet. Kind of like that O2 Jam

36:42.180 --> 36:49.560
as well. Just a really cool music game. They've got pictures out on the website now. They're

36:49.560 --> 36:54.480
also on PSP updates, which is pretty cool. The other thing for music gaming fans is this

36:54.480 --> 37:01.360
game called Button Mashing Revolution. That's when you play DDR on a controller. Yeah, DDR

37:01.360 --> 37:08.360
a controller. They have it for a PSP. You can go download it on PSPupdates.com as well.

37:08.360 --> 37:10.600
Another interesting thing I saw is they have a Pac-Man Racing...

37:10.600 --> 37:16.600
Wait, wait. Does it have Butterfly? I don't know. They have Pac-Man World Rally,

37:16.600 --> 37:20.160
which is going to be coming out here pretty soon. They'll probably compete with the Mario

37:20.160 --> 37:23.520
Kart game. Now, that looks kind of cool. From the screenshots

37:23.520 --> 37:25.880
you get of it, that looks kind of cool. It looks pretty cool.

37:25.880 --> 37:32.400
I hope it's not as shitty as the Crash Bandicoot racing game, though, because, man, those Crash

37:32.400 --> 37:35.120
Bandicoot spin-offs were god-awful.

37:35.120 --> 37:38.840
The Mario Party wannabe game was god-awful, and the racing game was god-awful.

37:38.840 --> 37:40.560
They have a new Crash Tag Team Racing game.

37:40.560 --> 37:41.880
I'm done with Crash Bandicoot.

37:41.880 --> 37:42.880
I really am.

37:42.880 --> 37:43.880
Tag Team Racing?

37:43.880 --> 37:46.240
That sounds like, I don't know, Mario Kart Double Dash?

37:46.240 --> 37:47.880
Sorry, I'm...

37:47.880 --> 37:48.880
My faith in the Crash Bandicoot series went out before.

37:48.880 --> 37:50.740
You want to hear what they did for this one?

37:50.740 --> 37:53.840
They made it a platform game and a racing game, so you can get out of your car and do

37:53.840 --> 37:54.840
platform stuff.

37:54.840 --> 38:00.440
but it's a racing game. Would you lose the race if you got out of your car to lay spikes

38:00.440 --> 38:05.240
down maybe or something? I forget. Alright, sorry, you're in Pac-Man World. Pac-Man World

38:05.240 --> 38:11.340
Race, or World Rally. Wait, wait, wait, wait. This is weird, because isn't there that Mario

38:11.340 --> 38:16.480
Kart arcade game coming out? Aren't there supposed to be Namco characters in that game?

38:16.480 --> 38:20.020
Yeah, there are. Because Namco is a part of that whole Triforce thing that did the F-Zero

38:20.020 --> 38:26.900
Ah, there is. So that's weird because if this is coming out to compete with Mario Kart...

38:26.900 --> 38:28.160
Okay, I got a headache. Forget it.

38:28.160 --> 38:30.260
You see where I'm going with this, though, right?

38:30.260 --> 38:36.620
I see where you're going with this, but yeah. Well, it'll be cool, but it's just, you know,

38:36.620 --> 38:39.620
what can I say?

38:39.620 --> 38:43.660
The other thing that they ported was Quake 2 this week. They've done a new port of that

38:43.660 --> 38:46.340
and that's pretty awesome, but I'm not a huge Quake fan, so...

38:46.340 --> 38:47.940
Oh, I'm going to check it out. I like Quake.

38:47.940 --> 38:48.940
But Quake 2, I mean...

38:48.940 --> 38:51.700
By the first Quake, though, I'm still a purist for the first Quake.

38:51.700 --> 38:57.540
Yeah, well, they have Quake II, or Quake I available right now, and that's pretty awesome,

38:57.540 --> 39:02.060
and Quake II is just going to be even more awesome.

39:02.060 --> 39:03.780
I kind of skipped over Quake II.

39:03.780 --> 39:07.100
I played a lot of Quake I, played a lot of Quake III, didn't play a lot of Quake II.

39:07.100 --> 39:08.100
I don't know.

39:08.100 --> 39:10.540
I'm just weird like that.

39:10.540 --> 39:12.060
Last story of the night, guys.

39:12.060 --> 39:17.500
Hideo Kojima has a blog out there, and it's been out there for a little while on the Kojima

39:17.500 --> 39:21.220
Productions website but now it's in English so you can kind of check out

39:21.220 --> 39:23.620
some of the things he talks about in his blog. What's kind of interesting he

39:23.620 --> 39:26.820
doesn't just talk about games I mean he talked about you know directing

39:26.820 --> 39:29.700
Metal Gear Solid 4 and he's talked about you know some personal things but he

39:29.700 --> 39:32.460
talks about kind of random things as well I thought this was an interesting

39:32.460 --> 39:37.060
quote what he said about Charlie and the Chocolate Factory the movie. I regret

39:37.060 --> 39:40.500
that today's children may identify more with the four children before they

39:40.500 --> 39:44.660
identify with Charlie. Our children live with the prospects of a gloomy dark and

39:44.660 --> 39:49.220
uncertain future. Our materialistic society disallows children the chance to become like

39:49.220 --> 39:53.780
Charlie because of the priorities placed on the fulfillment of desires, the pressure of

39:53.780 --> 39:58.420
entrance examinations, and other forms of competition. Yes, they are forbidden any means

39:58.420 --> 39:59.580
of becoming like Charlie."

39:59.580 --> 40:02.820
Interesting quote.

40:02.820 --> 40:08.540
I know I aspire to be Veruca Salt, I don't know about you, but forget it.

40:08.540 --> 40:16.340
Finally, I've got SQ Stare, you might remember him, he's the guy that's working on hacking

40:16.340 --> 40:19.620
the Wi-Fi in the DS.

40:19.620 --> 40:28.700
He's closing in on the bounty, which stands right now at $2,694.15, but he's pretty much

40:28.700 --> 40:35.780
almost 100% done with everything. Just a few more things to work on, but pretty soon they're

40:35.780 --> 40:40.860
going to be hacking that and God knows what that's going to bring. But I hear some pretty

40:40.860 --> 40:43.680
cool things are going to be coming out for the DS and the Revolution. I know they're

40:43.680 --> 40:48.140
talking about a new Mario Paint. Cool. Oh, like a Mario Paint with a Revolution would

40:48.140 --> 40:52.420
be cool with that controller. Mario Paint with Revolution and imagine Wi-Fi with the

40:52.420 --> 40:58.340
DS. Be able to post your picture chat on HD. That's great. That's beautiful.

40:58.340 --> 41:00.340
So we'll just have to look forward to that.

41:00.340 --> 41:01.340
Okay, sounds good.

41:01.340 --> 41:04.460
All right, final thoughts, your final thought.

41:04.460 --> 41:07.940
I'm going to have to try maybe picking up Metroid Pinball this week because I want to

41:07.940 --> 41:09.260
see about that Rumble Pak thing.

41:09.260 --> 41:10.260
That might be interesting.

41:10.260 --> 41:11.580
Oh man, too many games to buy.

41:11.580 --> 41:13.620
My final thought is there's too many games to buy.

41:13.620 --> 41:15.540
We're getting in that month now where I'm going to be broke.

41:15.540 --> 41:17.500
Oh wait, the Christmas season now.

41:17.500 --> 41:18.500
I'm going to die.

41:18.500 --> 41:20.620
November is like 50 billion games.

41:20.620 --> 41:22.500
It's going to be a fun month for us though with this show.

41:22.500 --> 41:25.260
So you've got to get a lot of free games.

41:25.260 --> 41:28.960
In fact, speaking of which, I'm going to be reviewing next week on the program Midway

41:28.960 --> 41:32.440
Arcade Treasures 3, which I'm looking forward to checking out.

41:32.440 --> 41:33.440
What?

41:33.440 --> 41:34.440
Supports HD.

41:34.440 --> 41:35.440
Does it?

41:35.440 --> 41:36.440
Yes.

41:36.440 --> 41:38.780
Oh, the Midway 2 did too, so awesome.

41:38.780 --> 41:43.180
I am so looking forward to playing Iron Man's Off-Road, which I believe is in here, yes?

41:43.180 --> 41:44.180
Yes.

41:44.180 --> 41:45.180
Super Off-Road, yes.

41:45.180 --> 41:48.180
And Off-Road Thunder, which is awesome, and Hydro Thunder.

41:48.180 --> 41:49.180
Loved Off-Road.

41:49.180 --> 41:52.340
Rush to Rock, Rush 2049.

41:52.340 --> 41:55.420
You know, when I first read about this game, I wasn't that excited about it because I was

41:55.420 --> 41:57.820
like, oh, it's just a bunch of, you know, racing games.

41:57.820 --> 42:02.180
But they are really good racing games, so I think I'll have fun with it.

42:02.180 --> 42:03.980
I'll let you guys know next week on the show.

42:03.980 --> 42:07.780
So anyway, my final thought is, of course, you know, too many games to buy, but we do

42:07.780 --> 42:12.780
have one final, final, final thought, and of course, Orange Launch Radio started as

42:12.780 --> 42:17.340
a music, you know, gaming station and we were dedicated to those music and game fusion games

42:17.340 --> 42:20.340
like Prappa the Rappa and DDR.

42:20.340 --> 42:26.360
In DDR there's been a musician in several of the Dance Dance Revolution games who anybody

42:26.360 --> 42:30.380
who's really into the Dance Dance Revolution games knows and really respects, and that's

42:30.380 --> 42:31.380
Captain Jack.

42:31.380 --> 42:36.620
Captain Jack passed away this week at the age of 43 of a stroke, he was in a coma earlier

42:36.620 --> 42:38.780
this week and then finally passed away.

42:38.780 --> 42:42.700
Captain Jack you would know because he always was in the uniform surrounded by hot ass women

42:42.700 --> 42:44.540
basically.

42:44.540 --> 42:47.380
Captain Jack was just all about fun music.

42:47.380 --> 42:50.100
His music was not going to win any Grammys.

42:50.100 --> 42:53.780
It was not going to be critically acclaimed.

42:53.780 --> 42:59.460
It was just about fun and getting stuck in your head with those little March songs.

42:59.460 --> 43:02.320
That's what DDR is all about because a lot of people when they get into DDR, they go

43:02.320 --> 43:06.060
play it and then they run home and they burn a CD of all the DDR songs and listen to it

43:06.060 --> 43:08.260
in their car and show all their friends and stuff.

43:08.260 --> 43:11.100
Captain Jack is just a part of that.

43:11.100 --> 43:16.340
The dance game community and really the music community as a whole lost somebody really

43:16.340 --> 43:17.340
awesome this week.

43:17.340 --> 43:21.020
So we wanted to dedicate tonight's episode to Captain Jack and although we don't normally

43:21.020 --> 43:25.140
play music on the podcast, we felt tonight it would be appropriate to play a little clip

43:25.140 --> 43:27.940
of you guys, of Captain Jack with Together in Forever.

43:27.940 --> 43:29.740
So we're going to close out with this tonight.

43:29.740 --> 43:31.580
Have a great week and we'll see you next week.

43:59.740 --> 44:02.740
Together, forever, we're all for one

44:02.740 --> 44:06.740
Together, forever, come and set me free

44:06.740 --> 44:09.740
Set me free tonight

44:09.740 --> 44:12.740
Baby, let me be your guide

44:12.740 --> 44:15.740
Ooh, set me free tonight

44:15.740 --> 44:18.740
Take your way too fast

44:18.740 --> 44:30.460
That's the end of another Orange Lounge Radio To Go edition.

44:30.460 --> 44:37.340
This podcast is a proud part of www.orangeloungeradio.com See you next update!
