On tonight's program, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to have a follow-up.
We're going to talk a lot about a follow-up to something we did last week.
Talking about Orange Lounge Radio jumping the shark.
For reals, yo.
We didn't jump the shark as much as we landed on it.
You didn't jump the shark as much as I thought you were going to.
It's going to all make sense tonight.
We're going to finally reveal what happened this week and why.
Why you guys are going to really get a kick out of this.
Also on this show, the ferret comes out of the closet.
Yes, and the ferret is getting his own show on Logo.
Go figure.
Also, I have a secret, and I'm going to tell you my secret.
My secret is that I'm gay.
No, I'm kidding.
We have a real secret.
No!
I would have never guessed.
All this time.
All this and more when we come back, so get ready.
Orange Lounge Radio is presented in the TMI sound format.
Oh, God.
Call me Daddy.
Orange Lounge may contain adult content.
Orange Lounge may contain many four-letter words.
Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity.
Orange Lounge may contain plenty of... Just kidding.
Orange Lounge Radio will not contain any of that in this episode.
Well, isn't that special?
Orange Lounge Radio Live is a fully interactive program via our website at www.orangeloungeradio.com And now, here are your hosts for Orange Lounge Radio Live, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.
We are live, and this is episode number 160 for this October the 16th, 2005.
You're tuned in to Orange Lounge Radio, radio that gamers really want.
We give you what you want, what you really, really want.
And this is Orange Lounge Radio Live.
Your home for all the news and discussion on rhythm and music games as well as the gamer community and the pop culture world.
We're plugged in and fully interactive through our website at www.orangeloungeradio.com My name is Rob Roberts.
You might know me as Sky.
Or you might know me as that guy.
Hey, you got... Stop distracting me.
Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts.
Sometimes I wish we were a TV show.
Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts.
Say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
I don't know why you're talking about all this live crap, because I feel half dead.
We're actually reanimated tonight.
We're not really alive.
In honor of Land of the Dead being released to DVD.
I must have zombie movie fest.
And I found my copy of Shaun of the Dead.
So we must all watch this.
Alright.
Also joining us tonight, the one and only, the beautiful Loki.
I'm beautiful today.
Our sex symbol on the show here.
Wow, that's funny.
I thought that was the ferret.
And to celebrate Loki being the sex symbol, he's actually wearing nothing but a bikini tonight.
And the shirt and pants, minus the bikini.
Again, reasons why we need to be a TV show.
So all of you out there can see through the lies.
All the lies.
We won't be able to see through the lies because we'll be blinded by your white ass.
My ass is not that white.
I'll take your word for it.
What, do you tan your ass?
I don't tan my ass.
Are you a nude sunbather?
I don't sunbathe at all.
That involves going outside.
I don't like outside.
Alright, say hello to our special guest tonight.
The one, the only, DDR Angel.
Hello.
How are you?
Good.
How are you today?
I'm playing Nintendogs.
You're playing Nintendogs?
My Nintendogs, I think, floated to the top of the bowl, finally.
I got a Dalmatian.
I named him Ikea.
I know, that wasn't my suggestion.
My suggestion was Alpo, that you name your dog Alpo.
You wouldn't name him Alpo and he wouldn't respond to Alpo.
So I named him Ikea after what looked like meatballs all over his body.
It was better than naming him, you know, Smallpox.
Also, in studio, say hello to the one and only, newly shaven, by the way.
That's what threw me off, is that Extaper was telling me earlier today that he was never going to shave off his beard, and he fucking did it!
I did it.
Liar, liar, pencil liar.
I know.
You look like five years younger.
I was going to do that little, you know, chin bacon strip thing, you know?
Like, is that what that's called?
Yeah, it's called a bacon strip when it's in another place.
Oh, okay.
Well, I call it the chin bacon strip.
I thought that was the Brazilian wax job.
No, Brazilian wax, I'll have Extrovert explain a Brazilian wax job a little later in the show.
Brazilian Wax Job Maybe we should leave that to Mr. Spanky God, it's going to be one of those nights Why don't you look that up on Wikipedia?
Okay, I'll do that right now See if Brazilian Wax Job's over on Wikipedia and you can explain that to all the kids exactly what that's all about Yeah, I just decided to shave it all off You shaved it all off?
I'm totally bald
I'm kidding.
Okay, yeah, anyway.
Tonight's show should be okay.
Tonight's going to be an okay show.
Don't get your hopes up.
No, I'm kidding.
We're going to have a good time.
I saw Serenity again.
We're going to talk about how was your week, how was your day.
We're going to talk about Orange Lounge Radio, Almost Jumping the Shark.
We're going to talk about My Little Surprise.
We're going to talk about a lot of stuff tonight.
And maybe we'll play a game.
We haven't played a game on the show in a while.
So I think we need to do some Bomani Match Game.
Can we also talk about opening the door?
Brazilian Waxing is on the Wikipedia.
Is it?
And I'm going to post it in the chat room.
DarkSakura is going to research Brazilian Waxing and talk to you all about it soon.
And X-Trooper is going to open the damn door so we can get some air in here.
Thank you.
Alright.
We will be back after this.
In this break, I have queued up some old school music.
So, it's just a potpourri of stuff, but it's old.
Like, all this shit's like three years old.
So, we're going to hear some old shit.
And stuff we don't play very often.
Well, our listeners are used to that.
They've been paying attention to us for three years.
Exactly.
Three and a half.
We're three and a half years.
We're like toddlers.
We're potty trained now.
We're learning how to read.
Okay, Sakurina, you know this wouldn't be the show if we didn't at least have five sexual references during the show.
Remember, adult.
Ron Shen says, Orange Lounge Radio, more sex, less Bimani.
Hey, in a perfect world, we would be about sex and Bimani.
Yeah, anyway.
We'll be back after this with Orange Lounge Radio where we'll talk about a lot of sex and some games.
We'll be back after this.
Thank you for watching!
I love you, I look at you, I hug you, I kiss you Even if it's just a casual kiss, I knew it was painful I knew there was no such thing as a painful past Once again, just a little longer, I want to watch your back
Piazza, Piazza, Piazza, Piazza, Piazza
Thank you for watching!
Thanks for watching!
Thanks for watching!
DarkSakura
DJ Ranma S,
Hello?
Hello, is this thing on?
Testing.
Testing, one, two.
I'm looking in the index, but I don't see anything for how to run a radio show.
Hello?
I don't understand this.
Does this thing work?
This thing reads like stereo instructions.
Is this on?
What the hell?
Orange Lounge Radio.
Broke Down Ghetto Bomani Radio.
What the f***?
We are back, and Rob had to run to the bathroom with explosive diarrhea from the burrito he ate a moment ago.
It really stinks, so we have the vent on and everything.
But I decided to go ahead and fill the gap, I would call our resident expert on all things that are very TMI, Mr. Spanky!
Mr. Spanky, where are you?
Hello, everybody!
Oh my god!
It's been forever since I've been on this show!
What's wrong with you people?
I thought you didn't love me!
Hello everybody, it's Mr. Spanky!
It's your favorite DDR dancer from DDRPC!
Does anybody play DDRPC anymore?
I'm using it to hold up the end of a table.
Everybody forgot about me!
That's okay.
That's okay that you people forget about Mr. Spanky because it gives me a lot of time to learn about sex.
And as I understand it, the kids today want to learn about Brazilian waxing.
So I'm going to talk a little bit about Brazilian waxing to the kids today.
Except, okay, if you're like really a kid, you don't want to listen because your mom and dad might get upset with you for listening.
And anyway, Brazilian waxing has to do with your pubic hair.
And if you're a kid, you don't have pubic hair.
So this doesn't matter to you.
However, DarkSakura, I know you want to know about this stuff.
So pay attention.
Okay, so I'm going to tell you guys about Brazilian waxing.
Basically what it is, in a Brazilian wax, it's a waxing of your pubic area.
And it means you completely remove the hair around your vulva.
Okay, but you only have a vulva if you're a woman.
If you're a guy, it takes away all the hair around your penis.
Not only that though, it's not just like a pubic waxing job.
A Brazilian wax means they wax your ass too.
So they take away all the hair around your anus.
So in order for them to do this, they have to coat you in hot wax.
So they have to coat you in hot wax around your penis and your anus or your vulva if you're a girl.
So this means you have to get naked with whoever is doing it.
But some people like to get naked, so it's okay.
and so they're going to rip away all that wax and they're going to leave you with a really clean butt and penis and vagina.
Well, hopefully you don't have all three.
So anyway, this is related to a type of sexual activity called akamokliktik, which means you have a preference for hairless genitals.
And I happen to know for a fact, Extifer, who I ran into at the sex club the other night,
Have this preference for hairless genitals, don't you?
Okay.
Well, I'm going to go now, kids, so you can talk about the DDR, but I hope you learned a good lesson today.
So remember, check it out, DDR PC, Mr. Spanky, one of the downloadable characters, only $5 in the bargain bin at Freud's.
Bye, everybody!
Bye, Mr. Spanky!
Rob, get out of the bathroom!
Oh, do it all night, do it with me.
I'll take you to heaven if you make me feel free.
Make sure to
DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
For any game companies that might be listening tonight.
DarkSakura, how was your week?
How was your day?
My week was fabulous in a really busy, crappy way.
I played a new game that I'm not going to talk about right now.
Dan got me the Lawyer game for DS.
I don't remember what it's called.
Phoenix Wright Attorney at Law.
And he's been playing it!
I want to see this, it sounds cool.
And apparently it's been, like, you do murder cases and shit like that.
And then, uh, I played, I tried to play Katamari, and he was like, I want to watch Star Wars.
So, because he bought, like, all the rest of the Star, not Star Wars, Star Trek movies.
So he's been, like, uber Trekkie mode.
I finished season one of Stargate.
Woo!
And then saw Serenity again.
Because I'm a big nerd.
That you are, no disputing that.
We had the Katrina relief sale on Friday night.
Yes, we did.
Sold a whole bunch of stuff, and we've managed to pull in $130 for the charity.
Woo-hoo!
So we are going to be delivering that, and all the leftovers are going to be going to the Salvation Army.
I also am going to be acquiring more things for giveaways on the show.
Very cool.
We like giveaways.
We're giving away...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
I had the assignment that she wanted us to do done, uploaded, ready.
I changed the text sizes.
I changed the fonts.
I changed the background color.
I added in line breaks and, you know, the bar thing.
And then I even put a picture on it.
So I'll be linking that in the chat room, what I did in my class.
I saw your webpage.
And I did this in, like, 15 minutes.
That's actually with two revisions.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Four classes, working full-time, the show, and going to the gym.
Ain't gonna happen.
I also went to the gym twice this week.
Be proud of me.
Good job.
That's more times than I went to the gym.
And then I ate ice cream all day, because Baskin-Robbins has pumpkin ice cream, and everyone should go have some.
That sounds... I want to go have some.
I just might.
And that's it.
All right.
Loki, how was your week?
How was your day?
My week was okay.
Thursday, we left the Tahoe for our company's 25th anniversary.
So that was kind of cool.
We got a bunch of DVDs and stuff that I'll be turning in for more games.
Then, what was it?
Last night, we actually had a party for our 25th anniversary, and they had the coolest thing ever.
They got the guy from that show, That's My Bush, to do this long-ass speech on video, and it was hilarious.
I mean, this guy is spot-on for President Bush, so it was really cool.
Just really awesome.
And I drank lots of alcohol.
That was free.
So that was also cool.
The other thing I did this week was basically just, I don't know, try to play some more new games.
I got SSX on tour.
That was pretty cool.
And I don't know, just same old stuff, work stuff, and lots of driving.
Fucking hate driving.
And worked on the PSP webpage.
Olrpsp.com Yes.
It's sexy.
Check it out.
It's going to be even sexier soon.
Good to hear.
I made a boo-boo.
Oh well, who cares.
Maybe the chat room will notice what it is.
Oh well.
Is that it?
That'd be it.
That's all I can think of.
That was interesting.
Okay, sounds good.
How was your week?
How was your day?
It went well.
I mean, it was boring, really.
Didn't do really anything.
Worked.
Saw the family yesterday.
You know, just did my shaving thing today.
But not the Brazilian way.
No, I didn't do the Brazilian way.
I can't shave my genitals.
I mean, if I shave my genitals, I mean, I break out.
So, it doesn't look very pleasing to the eye.
It looks like herpes?
It doesn't look like herpes.
That's the purpose of wax, so you don't shave.
Well, waxing, I'm pretty sure, would make me break out, too.
Maybe, I just have really sensitive skin around the area.
So... I think we all have sensitive skin around the area.
Yeah.
Especially the penis.
And, you know, let's say... The balls.
The balls.
So that's kind of how my week... I'm reminded of that one episode of Beavis and Butthead where the gym teacher's like, Today we're going to talk about the penis!
Forget it.
How was your week?
How was your day, Angel?
My computer exploded on Friday.
It literally blew up in a giant ball of flames?
The power supply went poof, so... Angel doesn't have a computer for...
I've been having trouble with it for the last couple days.
It's been doing some weird stuff that I... So what exactly does the power supply do when it explodes?
It stinks really bad.
Comments that nobody can hear except for me.
Yeah, that's fine.
And we went to a party yesterday, but that's okay.
And it was fun and it was good to see people and stuff like that.
Yeah, I guess that's it.
I've been working in school and stuff like that.
That's it.
Oh, and I found my Final Fantasy XI discs, so you know what I'm going to be doing this week if I can get the computer running.
Hey!
Hey!
I've also been playing World of Warcraft You need to be playing World of Warcraft with me, thank you Yeah, I have that What server are you on?
Right now, I'm playing on Maelstrom, but I'm playing on Scarlet Crusade Yeah, I have one on Scarlet Crusade that I haven't logged into for a week I'm only level 7, so it's all cool Yeah, I'll wait for you to catch up to me then I'm like 32 on that server Anyway, yeah, that's it for me, I guess
Bye.
Okay, bye.
Until later.
Okay.
Let's see.
What did I do this week?
Really, not a whole lot.
I worked my ass off.
That's what I did.
And I haven't had time for a whole lot of games.
I've just been playing Castlevania DS a lot.
Slacker.
Which I kind of... Shut up.
Which I'm making very slow progress on, and I've been playing a little bit of Final Fantasy XI.
Not a lot, though.
I haven't gained a level or anything.
I'm
Final Fantasy XI is kind of annoying me, but I'll talk about that later.
Final Fantasy XI is getting very annoying, so we'll talk about that later.
I think that's really about it.
I mean, God, I went to Target like twice this weekend, which is pretty cool, because I love Target.
Is Target not the greatest store ever?
It's not.
It's the Walmart.
I don't, see, I don't like Walmart.
Oh my god.
I don't like going into Walmart.
The thing about Walmart, like, I went to my hometown this weekend, and, like, they're building the biggest-ass Walmart there.
There's, like, four entrances in the front.
It's going to be a super center.
And we're getting one, like, around the corner from my house.
Really?
Super Walmart is the best if you're poor and need groceries, because you get, like, real groceries, but they're, like, half the price.
I want Super Target.
There's a Super Target in the place that I grew up as well.
But you can't get cheap groceries.
They don't have a full grocery store in them.
And not at Target Greatland, but there's also Super Target.
It might have a different name, but there's three levels of Target.
There's regular Target, Greatland, and then Mondo Target.
Super Target!
Super Target, like really big Target.
We just need the Orange Lodge grocery store.
It has a whole video game section.
You know, my dream grocery store would be just like that old TV show, Shop Till You Drop.
That's still on.
Is that still on?
Yeah.
No way.
Is it the old ass reruns from like the early, late 80s?
No, no, they still have, it's the one that was on Lifetime, right?
Yeah.
Yeah, they still have that.
It's like on, I think it's on PAX TV.
Lifetime Television for Women.
Yeah, now it's on Lifetime Television for Christians.
You know, PAX TV.
Oh, PAX TV.
Yeah, but no, it's still on there, I believe.
Supermarket Sweep, that's what it's called.
Supermarket Sweep is bad, okay?
Oh, why was I thinking Shop Till You Drop?
That must have been another show.
I think that was one that was where they go... Oh, it was the mall.
There's the mall one, yeah.
They don't have that one anymore.
I didn't mean that one.
I meant Supermarket Sweep.
That's what I meant.
Okay, yeah, they still have that.
Supermarket Sweep is badass.
Did, like, throw in those canned hams into this cart.
It was pretty badass.
But they never ever won.
They never ever found all of the things that they needed.
They totally won on that show.
I've seen it.
Like, I didn't.
I've seen Winners.
I've seen Winners.
I can't believe I got those two shows confused.
Weren't they on in like the same hour?
Like it was like the shopping hour on Lifetime?
Yeah, I believe it was.
I figured it out.
The chat room is correcting me because there's like a minute of lag between the chat and us, which is always kind of funny because everybody's yelling, it's supermarket sweep, not chat till you drop.
Our chat room, by the way, www.orangeonsradio.com, click on chat if you want to chat away with us.
All right.
Let's start off tonight by talking about a little bit of follow-up from last week.
Bleach Deathless?
No, not that.
No, no, no, I think you should talk about Bleach Hustle No, I'm done with the sex talk for tonight, Jesus I'm not I know you're never done with the sex talk, that's your problem Alright, let's talk about what happened this week with Orange Launch Radio Jamie, do you want to kind of set this story up?
What happened?
Is this about Thursday?
Yes Okay, last week I got an email Well, technically the week before
RedOctane
Now instantly we're like, is this in the groove?
No, it wasn't.
But admittedly, until Thursday, I was operating on the assumption that yes, it was going to be in the groove and another game.
So that's why I was commenting last week that you guys are going to get a big kick out of this because we're going to be talking about in the groove on TV and getting our honest, unedited opinion on the game.
But no, instead it's another game.
On Thursday, in my living room, which everyone can now see the awesomeness of my red couches, we played Guitar Hero.
And that game is awesome.
So I didn't get to do this because of a scheduling conflict, meaning my boss wouldn't give me the day off work.
You guys got to go play Guitar Hero.
So you and Loki are going to be in a segment.
When's this going to air?
Do we know?
In a couple weeks.
I was told I'm still waiting on the confirmation email from... I actually worked with another project manager.
Okay, cool.
So we'll actually post this on the site, obviously, when it's ready.
We'll let you guys know about this.
So what's the deal?
What happened with Guitar Hero?
What's it like?
Tell us all about it.
Well, first of all, everyone needs a picture in their head what the... And I'm going to use the easiest...
Comparison.
The controller, imagine the Guitar Freaks controller.
Now imagine the body style license from Gibson, as in a real guitar shape.
Five buttons and a whammy bar.
So yeah, it's pretty awesome.
And the way that you move your hands, it has an interface, because the game is put up by Harmonix.
The people who gave us frequency and amplitude.
Why did I say res?
But it has a very similar interface where the keys are coming toward you.
But on your easiest difficulty, you have three.
Then it goes to four on medium.
Then it's five and up for the harder difficulties.
If I remember correctly, I think it's three for easy.
Medium is three with the occasional fourth.
Well, it goes up to four for medium.
That's just what I just said.
Yeah.
Anyway...
But the way that you're moving your hands on it as you play it has a very, very real guitar feel to it.
They even go so far as to what they call it fret buttons.
The little switch for where your strings would be is actually called the strum bar and you have your whammy bar.
It's built with micro switches in it so you can actually hold them.
You have notes that you hold like you're really strumming them.
It's really pretty cool.
You build up your meter by wailing hard.
DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
They have them grouped as groups of five songs in each difficulty class.
Oh.
And then as you play, but you can actually do each song on it at different difficulties too.
So you will basically judge, you can work up through the list on easy and then work up through the list on medium and actually get your challenge out of it that way.
That's kind of a weird setup.
So it's not like a giant song wheel like we're used to in the Babylon games?
No.
In this game, if Guitar Freaks were a 10...
This game would blow that scale apart and put it up, you know, it would be 100 on a scale of 1 to 10, I think.
Wow.
It's really awesome.
Now, wait, is it set up like frequency and amplitude then?
Yes.
Okay, that's how like frequency and amplitude are.
It's like groups of five and then you play through it and there's like a bonus song you might unlock at the end?
The bonus songs are actually...
All originals.
Original songs.
So this sounds to me like it's pretty much Frequently in Amplitude, we finally get our sequel, except now it's a guitar game.
And they are actually only going to be sold with the guitar, with a price of retail $69.99.
But the guitar controller is the best controller of any type of non-traditional peripheral I have ever, ever seen.
It actually has substance and weight to it, not like heavy, heavy, but it definitely feels more substantial than the Guitar Freaks controllers, honestly.
The song list was fabulous.
I mean, it was just really awesome stuff.
Were there like actual songs in it, or was it mostly like karaoke-style covers?
They were remakes, however.
They were done...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
because Harmonix obviously also had a big hand in Karaoke Revolution and the remakes or whatever they did for Karaoke Revolution were not bad.
They weren't bad.
I mean, obviously not the original, but they're not bad, all things considered.
I've heard much worse remakes.
So kind of that same level of quality going into Guitar Hero then.
Pretty much.
I mean, it's like they spared no expense, wasted nothing.
Anything that could have gone into the game to make it feel like
The experience of being on stage and playing a guitar, they've gone out of their way to do.
On top of that, you actually, in your career mode, you have a selectable character list.
One of the characters is based off of Keith Richards, but when I first saw this character, me being the Gorillaz fan I am, he was playing a flying V. I was like, did they put Murdoch in this game?
Because I was like, excuse me, but no, it was actually based off of Keith Richards directly, so I thought it was funny.
I had a nerd moment.
That's cool.
But,
There's Megadeth in that game.
Symphony of Destruction is in that game.
What were some of the other songs you guys can remember?
There's some Stevie Ray Vaughan.
Who else do you remember?
What did you play?
I played Smoke on the Water.
Okay.
Because that was awesome.
I also played Iron Man.
And I think it was like Turn It Up or whatever.
Whatever that stupid song is that's in the PSP commercial.
Franz Ferdinand's song.
Yeah, Franz Ferdinand.
I played that.
I checked out some of the unlocked songs because there is apparently a way to keep pressed to unlock all the songs because we watched them do it.
Yeah.
So, yeah.
Anyways, they had some of the original songs like Guitar Hero, of course, was one that they came up with.
And then I was looking for, apparently there's a Freeze Pop song in there, but I didn't see it.
Well, of course, there's got to be a Freeze Pop song.
Oh, another song that's in that is Ziggy Stardust.
Oh, cool.
That's cool.
But, um.
All right.
Yeah, the controller, it's just like a normal controller.
Buttons were sticking.
I had a little bit of a button sticking problem, but it wasn't bad.
It was really, you know, it's upstuck, fixed, done.
Who cares?
It's pretty cool, though.
Really easy to get into.
The whammy bar thing, though, kind of throws you off when you're trying to do that, because you're supposed to hold the note down for so long and then do the whammy bar thing, and it takes a while to get used to it.
But it looks pretty good.
I can see the potential for some lawsuits.
The game is a little similar to other games, but... The differences, I think, are substantial enough that they can't... The controller is so completely... You can't do a guitar controller without having it be similar.
However, after a little bit of interviewing, the controllers are actually completely built from the ground up.
The switch is built on a different mechanism than the Guitar Freaks controller.
I'm not talking about Guitar Freaks.
I'm talking about another game.
I'm saying this game's too much like Karaoke Revolution.
The interface and everything's too similar.
But Harmonix co-made it, so who cares?
Oh, I guess that's fine then.
They own the patent, so... Yeah, Harmonix.
And on top of that, it doesn't flow side to side, it flows forward.
Yeah, whatever.
It's an okay game.
Harmonix developed and Konami published Karaoke Revolution, and this time Red Octane is publishing Guitar Hero.
Well, it's a step in the right direction for Red Octane actually getting real companies to develop games for them.
You know...
So I think that's great, but I don't know.
It's good.
I'm looking forward to it, since we're not going to get Guitar Freaks until at least next fall.
At least.
Probably never, but yeah, at least.
This game is going to completely blow Guitar Freaks out of the water.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, it sounds interesting, because if Guitar Freaks now comes out later this time, they're going to... If it's happening, we don't know, but we can speculate that since...
Guitar Freaks V is coming out overseas that maybe now is the time for it here if it's going to come out.
I'm awfully surprised that they didn't jump with that first instead of Beatmania because I think Guitar Freaks is pretty easy to market to people instead of Beatmania whereas, you know...
DJ Simulator playing a guitar, okay, that makes more sense.
But they're also coming from the import fanbase, I think.
And how was DDR really successful?
A lot of it was word of mouth, and Beatmania has a really rabid fanbase established, although I think that rabid fanbase is going to turn a little bit on a US version, just because you've seen what's happened with DDR, and people bitch because, you know, it's not as good as the Japanese versions, and I have this bad feeling the same thing's going to happen here.
although we don't know yet because we haven't seen enough of the game.
The other thing that's... But, sorry, sorry, I just want to finish my thought here.
Guitar Freaks does not have that same fan base.
I mean, granted, there are loyal Guitar Freaks players out there, but you don't exactly see GuitarFreak.com or things like that, you know what I mean?
Like, there's a very established Beatmania base on, like, Bomani style, very established DDR base on DDR Freak, but no real solid Guitar Freak base, if you know what I mean.
Anyways, one thing to mention though is all the songs are full length, so that is something kind of cool.
Although I was kind of wishing that there would be some short versions too, kind of like how Karaoke Revolution doesn't have the option of playing a shorter or longer version of the song.
Would have been nice, but still really cool.
Yeah.
Now the other thing though, this other story that they're doing about In The Groove though, I couldn't help but think that this story's been done before.
I mean...
The whole, like, oh, people using the game to lose weight.
I mean, come on.
It's been done with DDR.
It's just another freaking game ripping off on DDR.
Of course people are going to lose weight because they're moving around.
It's just the same story all over again, though.
I didn't really see why they were covering that.
But they didn't talk to you guys about that story at all.
No, they didn't.
They didn't.
But they're talking to other people in the community.
But still, it's the same thing.
It's like, you know, I don't know.
It'd be like, you know, doing a story about, like, oh, teen, you know, people are...
Thank you for watching!
What else will the media say about DarkSakura?
Video games.
Now we're going to get this one.
Orange Dogs Radio was saying that video games don't cause violence.
You know what causes violence?
People cause violence.
Sucked up people cause violence.
I cause violence.
Guns don't kill people.
I do.
Nah.
I don't know.
It looks like a good game.
I'm really looking forward to it.
It's supposed to be coming out, I guess, in November.
Guitar Hero?
Yeah.
So it'll be good.
Um.
I want to play it.
I'm pissed I didn't get to go and be a media whore like you two.
I got a lot of footage of me playing the game.
I did, however, slip.
Did you say it's so fun?
I didn't say it's so much fun, but I said it's so fun.
So that's almost as bad.
And I know what you're hoping.
Dear God.
Dear God.
Whatever those YM fucking whatever they are called.
I'm praying here.
Dear God who art in heaven.
Please, I've been a good boy this year, and I go to church every Sunday.
Well, okay, even if that church is called Burger King, who cares?
I praise God in my own special way.
God, don't listen to him.
Shh, shh, I'm praying.
God, if you're listening right now, I really, really, really, really, really want KCRA to use the clip of Loki going, this is so fun, and nothing else.
God, please show lots of Jamie in the story.
Show lots and lots of Jamie, but please only show Loki saying it's oh so much fun or whatever the hell he said.
I appreciate it.
Love and amen.
Rob.
Jesus Christ.
I even caught myself right after.
I'm like, ah, shit.
Yeah.
I can't wait.
I'm going to have my TiVo ready.
I know I'm going to watch it and be disappointed again.
Just going to be disappointed.
All right.
We'll see what happens.
At least you guys get to be on TV.
I'm not even there.
I'm just going to pretend to be bitter about it for a while.
No, that's cool.
That's cool.
I probably won't even be in it.
I'll just be playing the guitar.
Or you'll see your feet or your hands.
Because your feet were in the paper, so why not have your hands on TV?
That would be pretty cool.
Yeah, I think the hands might work.
All right.
Or I'll be doing something retarded.
Because I was trying to over-exaggerate the movements that you would play during the game in hopes of more TV time.
So we're going to see this clip of Loki during the whammy bar, like he's going to drop to his knees and go, I should have done that.
Shit!
I wasn't thinking.
See, I didn't prepare.
It's going to be like that scene in Risky Business where Loki just comes out in a t-shirt and his undies and slides across the floor playing the guitar.
That's what we're going to see on the news.
I remember one time Dan bringing out my DDR pad on Dreamcast because it was just sitting there and grabbing one of the Guitar Freaks guitars and then rolling around on the floor being a freak, wailing hard.
So he decided that they needed a new game using the itoy called Air Guitar Freaks.
Have it.
Why not?
They can do Samba de Amigo with the iToy.
They have a guitar game in iToy Play 3.
What?
Yeah, air guitar.
There's an iToy Play 3?
Yes.
I didn't know that.
No one buys them!
iToy Play 1 sucks!
Okay, they have iToy Play 1, iToy Play 2, iToy Play 3, and Spy Toy.
They also have iToy Chat.
Spy Toy?
Spy Toy.
Does that mean you can use it to spy on your neighbors who have iToys in their house?
No, you can use it as a surveillance system, and you can also play spy-themed games.
Let me tell you, there's a lot of iToy games out there that you never hear about because they suck.
All of them suck.
I want to get iToy chat and then just sit on the couch naked and see what happens.
Is that wrong?
Do you need to pray again?
No, I don't.
Dear God, please don't let this haven go to hell.
Okay, stop stealing my bit.
I just want to get iToy chat and then just join the room and...
Hey guys, what's up?
I'm just letting it all hang out tonight.
What are you guys up to?
Do they moderate on iToyChat?
They can't moderate that, can they?
You can do it, I think, up to 15 people per room or whatever, and you can...
Chat via video and voice.
I think you can do up to 100 people via text chat.
Do they have adult-rated rooms, though?
Because, like, you know, look at Yahoo.
Like the Yahoo Messenger program.
You can do webcams on Yahoo, but the only thing I know that people use that Yahoo cam thing for is for sex.
Or web sex, whatever they call it.
Cam sex, whatever the hell they call it.
I'm not into cam sex.
I'm not going to knock cam sex for those of you that are into it.
Here's the really crappy stuff you can do.
You can actually play games.
Like they have, you know, chess.
Maybe you can do strip chess.
Spank the monkey.
You know, strip battleship.
Wait, you can play chess using your hands and stuff?
You can play chess.
Or any appendage that you can play.
You can play battleship or naval war is what they call it.
Ow, you sunk my battleship!
Oh baby, sink it.
But anyways, um, no, they've got, um, a lot of weird games in this thing.
Um,
It says you can do... What the hell?
I think you can just make your own rooms.
Can you make your own porn?
Um, you can... That would sell some eye toys.
You can turn into a video phone, so... I guess.
Did you know that there'd be underage porn?
Because all the, like, 16 to 17 year olds that have eye toys are gonna, you know, run around naked on it, and then that's just wrong.
You know, we can't have that, you know, so... Um... Yeah, I don't know.
I don't know about that, but, um...
Yeah, Itoy Chat 3.
In fact, if I remember correctly, I think that came out last month.
I just... I know that these games sucked, so... I played Itoy Play 2 at E3, and I was thoroughly unimpressed.
Oh, maybe Itoy Play 3 hasn't come out yet.
I was more impressed with the Harry Potter Itoy game than I was with Itoy Play 2.
And even though Harry Potter...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
But the way the balloons are positioned... They look like big penises.
It looks like you're blowing up a boner.
And this one woman on the end with her yellow balloon, she's all into it.
She's like, oh, I got a big balloon.
I don't know.
What the hell?
That's great.
Please check that out in chat.
Yeah, it's really bad.
They have another one called Call Kitty.
I guess, I don't know.
And this looks really weird.
I don't know what the hell this game... No one should play itoy games ever.
I mean, I don't think anyone should actually buy the itoy.
I talked about doing this a while back, you know, I have a ton of itoy games.
We should just really do a review of all the itoy games out there, because it'll take like five minutes.
I mean, really, there's not that much.
I've only played itoy Groove.
and iToyPlay.
iToy Groove is an interesting concept but it's executed not that well because I can't like play it for shit.
Oh my god, please post that in chat.
There's grandma playing an air guitar game.
That's great.
I need to make an icon of that.
Oh my god, please do.
Okay.
That needs to be like our new like Orange Lounge logo thing.
Can we make a background for ORPSP.com?
I suppose.
We'll see.
Oh my god, that's great.
All right.
Anyway, enough picture chat because it doesn't make for very good radio.
We're going to take a break, I think, kids.
And we're going to come back.
And Extrofer wants to chat for a little bit because Extrofer has some news he wants to share with you guys.
Yes, I do.
I don't know.
We'll hear from them when they call in after this.
So we're going to get to Sky Blind after this.
And in this break, we're going to do some Guitar Freaks music.
We'll be back after this.
Thank you for watching!
I want to see you again if it's a dream
Kriva Kriva
You gotta easy day You gotta easy day You gotta easy day You gotta easy day
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
Thanks for watching!
That wasn't a promo.
What the hell happened there?
My bad.
Well, we'll just come back cold.
Hi, we're back on Orange Lounge Radio.
Unprofessional Internet Radio
having my own show on OrangeLoungeRadio.com and you all should listen and it's going to be on Mondays and it's going to be called X to First Case of the Mondays and it's a good show for all of you that are wanting to start off your week with something a little bit light and something you don't have to really pay attention plus I'll say a lot of really horrible things on it probably so you guys should all listen
Yeah.
When's the debuting?
Yay!
When's the debuting?
Hopefully a week from tomorrow.
Okay.
And I'm hoping that it'll be 7 to 9.
Okay.
I will talk about video games for all of you that are into that sort of thing.
I don't know.
And there's plenty of other hours talking about Captain Tightpants.
I will talk about Captain Tightpants.
Um, it's, it's for all of the, you know, Orange Lawn's radio is filled with straight guys, so I feel like, hey, I'll be the queer voice for the straight guys here.
Um, hello?
Oh, no, no, no, like, I'm not a guy.
No, straight, straight people, sorry, PC, straight people.
Oh, wait, so you, so you, basically, Extraverse Case of the Monday is like, it's, it's queer, queer eye for the gamer guy?
For people who don't enjoy the, Queer voice for the gay, gay, never mind.
What, what were you saying?
Queer ear for the,
Straight... Dears?
Queer voice for the straight guy's ear.
That's what I said.
Okay.
Well, no.
Queer cock for the straight guy's ass.
No, I'm going to... You know, it's not like... You guys can hear a gay guy talk.
It's not like I'm going to be in your house.
You don't have to fear that I'm going to fuck you up the ass.
Because I do that.
I fucked Loki like three times during the show tonight.
So you guys are going to all have a good time.
On Mondays, hopefully, I hope for everybody to listen in, and I'll have special guests and everything.
It'll be fun.
Okay, sounds like fun.
Yay.
So it's going to be a week from Monday.
A week from Monday.
All right, sounds good.
And if you like the title, let me know.
If you don't, let me know also.
It's a work in progress.
If you don't like it, forget it.
Okay.
Your title is fabulous.
Yay.
And you can email me if you have any suggestions on what you want me to talk about as well, my email address.
is Volumetext.
We'll get you an orange launch one.
Okay.
Well, right now, I mean, you can still email me at my other address.
It's Volumetext at gmail.com.
That's how it spells out, so if they go ahead and send it to the podcast email, I'll forward it.
Just say, to Xtifer.
And now you're going to also be doing a lot of Buffy and Serenity talk, I'm sure.
I'm sure I will, you know, and I will talk about other things as well.
Right.
Now, also coming up a week from Wednesday, if I play my cards right, I will be coming back with a solo show, the launch date, a week from Wednesday.
I know I've been talking about doing a solo show for a long, long time now, but it will actually happen, for sure.
I'll be coming back a week from Wednesday.
That's Captain Tightpants?
No, not Captain Tightpants.
I do not have a name for the show yet, so until I get a better name, it's just going to be the Rob Roberts Show.
And a little thing, I'm actually doing mine every other week because of school constraints.
When I'm out of, when the semester's over, I will be going back to... Regular, every week.
Regular.
Just for the next nine weeks, every other week.
Alright.
Sounds good.
Maybe you should call your show the Rod Roddy Show.
No, because he died and that's sad.
Anyway.
So that's going to be coming back.
And I will not talk about such gay things.
I mean, I realize I'm gay, but I have other things to talk about other than, you know, who I'm fucking.
So I'm going to talk about tech stuff and geeky news.
And yes, some video games, but I'm going to kind of go outside the realm and talk about cool things on the interweb.
And just whatever I want.
It's going to be my thing to just do whatever I want.
And for those of you guys that miss Vanilla Sky and Outside the Box, unfortunately, you know, I haven't gotten...
The folks that were on that show to commit to come back, and I think we're going to have scheduling problems.
But hopefully once in a while they'll drop in or something as time goes on.
But for now, this is just going to be my solo thingy.
But I'll try to have guests as well.
So we'll be working on that.
We're going to have live shows Monday, every other Tuesday, and Wednesday.
It's only every other Tuesday for a little while, so not that long.
Also, to make up, though, for my missing Tuesday nights, I plan on occasionally doing fuck-off shows.
That means you have to be listening late at the night.
That's right.
So it'll be a good time.
All right.
So lots of live stuff coming back to Orange House Radio soon.
That should be fun.
And Loki, still no show.
Don't look at me.
I'm not... I know.
I've got a fiancé that doesn't allow the... We need to give her a show.
I need to freaking play more Final Fantasy XI is what I need to do.
Let's have... Let's get Nelly to fill in for the weeks that DarkSakura's not here.
I want you and Nelly to be guests on my show.
That'd be cool.
I'll be on your show.
I'm going to have everybody on my show.
And... Yeah.
All right.
We can have a Brazilian wax job show where we all wax each other.
Like, ooh, that looks so good.
That's okay.
Anyway.
Okay, bad idea.
So I want to talk about something now.
Your last wax job.
No, no, it's not sex related.
They're not necessarily sexual.
I did something today.
Uh-oh.
Do you need to be tanked?
What?
Do you need to be tanked?
Maybe.
It's kind of one of those things that I said I was never going to do.
Just get it out, man.
You have one life.
Live it.
But, I don't know, something happened and it's like, you know, I decided maybe I was being just a little too harsh and I needed to open up my mind a little bit.
And your... And your ass.
And my butt.
So...
I went and I picked up World of Warcraft today.
Let's hope that Miklatov is not listening right now.
Oh, I already told him he's pissed.
He's pissed.
Oh, really?
He's pissed at me.
So...
I bought World of Warcraft, and I actually already had a chance to play it a little bit before the show.
I'm on a server called Doomhammer, but I do plan to make a character on Scarlet Crusade as well.
Bronzebeard, too.
Because I know that's where all you guys are at.
Play Horde on Bronzebeard.
Well, I'm only going to limit myself to three characters, because I have so many friends that play, I need to... I have two.
So, I'm going to have one on Scarlet Crusade for you guys.
Alliance.
Alliance on Scarlet Crusade.
Play a Night Elf.
I will be near where you'll go.
We'll see, we'll see.
And then also, I will be on wherever the gay one is.
I think it's P something.
I want to play on the gay server.
So, well then I'll let you know which one that is.
Okay.
So, that's it.
I'm on World of Warcraft.
I've already played it.
I played it a little bit before tonight's show.
Isn't it so much better?
No, it's just different.
You can actually... I'm not going to say it's better because it's different.
It actually reminded me a lot of Guild Wars.
I know that World of Warcraft came first, but it plays a lot like Guild Wars.
A lot, a lot like Guild Wars.
Why are you shaking your head disapprovingly, Loki?
Just, you know, going to another game that you won't play.
Whatever.
I'm sticking with one game that I won't play.
Good job.
No, I'm not leaving Final Fantasy XI.
I'm not by any means canceling my account on Final Fantasy XI.
I just... I got to this point where I was like, I'm bored, and I don't want to be bored, and...
I feel like I don't have enough time to invest in the game, and I'm never going to be able to participate in the way the game is set up in a lot of the end game events because I have no time to play.
So I just wanted to find another game to fill casually my time.
But I do have a lot of friends that still play Final Fantasy XI, and I do plan on doing some things in it, just very limited.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Yeah.
So that was my big secret.
I finally caved.
Bah, bah, bah.
And I bought World of Warcraft.
That's alright.
You'll just switch to the next big thing when World of Warcraft comes out.
That's right.
I probably will.
I'll stick with Final Fantasy XI since I don't even know what's going on now.
And they've added another update and they're doing the launch of that Treasures of whatever the hell it's called.
It's going to be coming out again with more.
I do want to check that out.
With more player classes.
I'm hoping that for...
I know it's probably not going to happen.
I'm hoping that the Xbox 360 version is on the same servers, because then that could just, you know... It will be.
Well, I'm not sure about that, because it might be on Xbox or Microsoft servers, in which case, you know, then you won't be able to play with other people.
If it is, then I can cancel my PlayOnline account and just play for my Xbox Live, and that'll kind of cut down on costs a bit.
Plus, I'll be able to, you know, have the game looking better.
We need Katamari, the NMO RPG.
I need to roll over the king.
There's one thing I want to add about World of Warcraft is I like how you can...
You have to set up a macro for it.
I like that you don't have to play with people if you don't want to, and you don't have to be the party bitch like I used to be.
I know, they're different.
I'm not going to compare the games.
I like playing as Druid.
They're different.
Because I can kick their ass.
I like chatting with people in chat rooms, but only to myself, because talking with other people online is awful.
No.
There's a difference between talking to other people and then having to actually play with strangers.
It's still interacting.
Still the same argument.
Do these strangers have candy?
Because I like candy.
Rob, I'm going to kick your ass.
Speaking of which, Rob...
Xtifer, will you tell Shane to stop hating me?
He's mad at me.
Is he listening?
Shane, he's impulsive you know you were encouraging me you were cheering me on yeah, get it, get it, so I can use your buddy pass well yeah, I was unapologetically saying that but it's like, I'm impulsive too and I'm not gonna probably play I'm gonna probably play your buddy pass but I mean, that's gonna be limited
I'm having a fun time with Final Fantasy XI right now.
I'm, like, really enjoying it.
And I'm still a white mage.
I mean, that's the weird part about it.
Is, like, I've actually enjoyed... And you're the party bitch too, right?
Yes, yes, I've been the party bitch.
But, like, it's been actually okay, because I've been learning the skill of it all.
I'm 15 right now.
So, I mean, I'm kind of working at it, but it's going well.
I got tired of being the party bitch, so I just let the ingrates die.
I have the instant, you know, bad party remedy.
It's wonderful having the cable modem right on my desk, because I can just... Look at that!
My connection went down!
I wonder how that happened.
Oh, the cord fell out.
Oh, damn it.
Oh, well.
I guess I won't log back in.
Damn internet.
I'll never figure out how to put this cord back in until at least a couple days from now.
No.
All right.
We're going to go to...
The Skype line, guys.
OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
Click on Interact With Us if you want to call us on the Skype line.
You can check us out.
Username is Orange Lounge Radio.
But please, please, please, before you call us, if you've never talked to us before, make sure you call a username on Skype.
It's Echo123 is the username on Skype.
Make sure that you call Echo123 first before you call us.
That way you can see if you can hear yourself or not.
And I don't think you have to add this person to your buddy list.
You just call them.
Straight up.
Echo123.
And that's that.
Oh, random aside, Sakurina reminded me of something here.
Beatmania2DX is actually in the World of Warcraft credits.
In the special thanks section or something.
Like, they credit the game with, I guess, passing the time while they were coding the game.
I don't know.
And you know what?
Echo123 is the perfect person to talk to if you don't like interacting with other people and MMOs.
Let's take a call.
You're on Orange Launch Radio.
It's Legend of Zaku here.
Hello, Legend of Zaku, our serial caller.
How are you?
Yes, you probably already know where I've been this weekend.
Yes, you went to Digital Life, yes?
Yes, and I have so much, and I have some pretty, you know, I got a lot of good shit that I have to say right now.
Tell us, tell us.
The DDR tournament there.
Got coverage.
It got shitloads of coverage.
Like what kind of coverage?
MTV was filming there, you know, yesterday for a better part of the Freestyle Division.
And you wouldn't believe this.
NBC ended up filming a sitcom, part of an episode of the sitcom, in the center stage after Freestyle.
What?
What sitcom?
Do you know?
Yes.
I don't know, but it was just two white guys just dancing right there on a fifth mix.
The Drip Machine, Climax Basic Like My Name Is Earl or something?
I don't know, just two white guys dancing, yeah, doing like You Got Served thing on a DDR pad.
And they, yeah, they pretty much shot that scene there.
Should be interesting.
Were they both flamey?
No, DDR's already been on Will & Grace.
Oh, it has?
Yes.
Oh.
Yeah, but... Okay, I also might have to snag a few things from the Red Octane booth, which was right next to the tournament area.
Okay.
Behold the link that I'm posting up right now.
You wouldn't believe who I managed to meet.
Kyle Ward from In The Groove.
Hello?
Yeah, I mean, I was so shocked I was speechless, Zaku.
Oh, what is this?
Zaku, I fucking love you.
You just went up like 100 points in my book.
What the fuck is that?
Zaku got the person who wrote all the songs and in the groove to autograph something for us.
Zaku, I want your man babies.
Seriously.
You are awesome.
Seriously, I'm going to send it out to you sometime this week.
Just give me an address to send it to.
That is beautiful.
Also, I'm asked to play Guitar Hero this weekend.
I'm asked to play Guitar Hero this weekend.
Just one word, it's really hard for beginners to pick up, since you literally not only have to hit the button, but, you know, one of the buttons on the neck, but you also have to hit, you know, the little tab right there with the screw head that makes up the strings.
Exactly, I can't contain myself, we're all looking at the pictures and I'm giggling and I can't stop laughing, this is the coolest thing ever.
but it's not as cool as what you know but it's basically not as cool as this uh oh they had in the group two on a slim ps they had in the group two running on a ps2 okay after burn with red octane after burners that's cool okay so they so how how was that
Well, it's just the same thing.
I know Kyle Ward didn't want to say that much about when it was going to be released.
All I know is that I saw In The Groove 2 running on a PS2.
Okay.
And I got to play it on Afterburners.
To be honest, though, In The Groove 2 coming out on PS2 is kind of a duh.
I mean, we know it's going to happen at some point, but... Loki?
Well, the thing, though... That and they also had DDR Mario Mix, right, you know, playable over there.
Hold on, Loki has a thought.
It was a pretty...
There's a pretty long line trying to get through there.
If it's ran off a slim PS2, then that means it's not a beta kit, so that means it's probably done.
Yeah, it's probably a build.
I had all the songs in it, though.
Interesting.
Yeah, I had it.
Okay, okay.
How was DDR with Mario?
Huh?
How was DDR with Mario?
I did get a chance to play it, but I saw folks, you know, because the lines were pretty vague for that, and I didn't have enough time.
But, you know, it looks like a regular DDR mix, except, you know, obviously it's a license.
Yeah, and way easier.
From what I hear, there's no mods on it.
You can't even pick speed mods on that mix.
Oh, I didn't know that.
Yeah, that's what I heard.
I don't know if it's true, and the only way to find out is by getting it.
Let me see, what else can I say?
Xbox 360, obviously, yeah, they did have some on display.
It wasn't that much free shit to go around over there as well, but I did manage to get an In The Group 2 t-shirt.
Um, and yeah, and that's it.
Did you do your tequila thing in the tournament?
No, I didn't.
I didn't have the time or the money.
But as I said, MTV got plenty of coverage yesterday.
They were pretty much filming there.
They were focusing on two players that I know through DDR.
And that's pretty much what I've seen.
I'm trying to remember what else.
Yeah, lots of Halo.
All right.
MTV's actually backing Guitar Hero.
Hmm.
Who is MTV?
Really?
Yep.
And like I said earlier, Gibson Guitars.
That's going to be a pretty big music game.
We'll see.
Alright, Zaku, I can't thank you enough for getting...
Call, or what is he called?
Kiel?
Call?
I don't remember.
He's called by both.
Kiel, thank you so much for getting him to autograph something saying that we rock.
It's really fair.
We were playing his music back.
That is awesome.
I'm so excited.
Just give me an address and send it to me.
I'll get it to you.
Look for a private message from me very soon, and we'll send you something from the prize vault in exchange.
Okay?
All right, man.
Have a good one.
Thank you for calling.
All right, later.
Later.
Bye.
Bye.
That's too funny.
I'm sorry, that's great.
At least it wasn't, like, addressed to, like, myself or DarkSakura.
I mean, because that wouldn't even step up in funny.
Still, though.
Still, though.
It's so cool.
That's pretty funny.
Yeah.
All right, let's go to another call.
Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Hi, Sephiroth 1215 here.
Hello, Sephiroth 1215, what's on your mind?
I have to say that I'm pretty pissed because I went to Digital Life today and missed everything.
And missed everything?
What happened?
Did everybody leave?
No, today just sucked.
I mean, it was crowded, I couldn't play one game.
The only thing I was able to play was Guitar Hero once, and I got to play DDR with Mario.
But otherwise, you couldn't even play in the DDR machines they had there, and all the good stuff they were giving away for free over at Red Octane were gone.
Well, they'll let anybody into digital life, right?
Pretty much, you don't have to be in the industry or anything, right?
You just get to go, pay your admission fee, right?
Yeah.
So they probably got way, way more people than they were thinking?
Maybe.
It was pretty crowded today.
Interesting.
I wonder if they get more people in E3, probably.
I really wanted to go, but, you know, I was stuck here in California, unable to get some time off to come out there, or I should say fly out there.
Did you observe anything else that was cool?
I took a while to look at the finals of the DDR tournament, which was okay, but it went by really, really slow.
Because every time people went up and they got off, they had to fix the machine again.
Wow.
It just took a long time.
But, uh...
A friend of mine actually won a free DDR rental machine.
What, like won a machine?
Well, to rent.
Oh.
So, like, for his next house party, he can get a free DDR machine for the party?
Yeah, pretty much.
He wants to run a tournament for himself.
That's kind of cool, I guess.
I'd probably do something similar.
I've always wanted to get a DDR machine on the back of a truck and go driving around town having a tournament on the back of the truck.
I like that.
How long can you stand up?
I'm sorry, what?
When it came to, like, other games, though, the whole thing was just full of Xboxes.
Like, I found a few PS2s and, like, two GameCubes.
But otherwise, they were all mainly games I didn't really care too much about.
And even the old games, they had big lines for them that are even out right now.
Wow.
But the 360 preview wasn't too bad.
I mean...
They showed a lot of the most recent, I guess.
More than what you can see at E3, I don't know.
Anyways, a real quick segue here.
What you're talking about, the DDR tournament on the back of a truck, it reminded me of the Jackass sketch where they were doing roller disco in the back of a van and they were driving around like a moving man.
That was pretty funny, so I guess it could work.
I'd want to rent a DDR machine.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I was worried I'd get one anyway, because I always just get the systems no matter what.
I don't even care too much about the Xbox, but there's always games that come out specifically for it.
You know there's going to be some DDR Ultramix 360 or something.
I think it's inevitable that we get something like that, and that'll be the must-have game of next year or the year after.
Yeah, sure.
Otherwise, they did have a lot of NES games to play.
There was Mario Kart and Animal Crossing out there.
I heard they were demoing the Wi-Fi thing a little more, because I saw some pictures on the Internet of that.
I didn't really get to play any of it because there's big lines for it, so I just went over to DDR with Mario, which actually had no line.
Surprise, surprise, no line for DDR with Mario.
What did you think of it?
It was easy, but I mean, I put on whatever I could to make it harder, and she told me to put on something where you get bomb arms on top of the screen, and you have to hit the photo bows to make sure the bomb arms don't blow up.
Mm-hmm.
Which can be a little bit harder, only because the protobots come pretty quickly, but it wasn't too bad.
Okay.
Otherwise, what I thought was interesting there is they had a setup for ParaPara on... What?
Yeah, by the DDR machines, but it was off.
All I saw was the ParaPara controllers, and it's just the ParaPara underneath.
Like for PlayStation 2 or for the arcades?
Interesting.
Okay, well.
Maybe there's... I don't know.
Maybe just some kid brought it from home to let everybody play.
I don't know.
That's weird.
That is very weird.
But it wasn't on.
Anything else you want to share with us?
Not really.
I was fairly impressed with Guitar Hero, though.
I played one of the second easiest kind of songs.
I mean, it took me a second to learn, but otherwise it wasn't too bad.
Yeah, we're getting a lot of good early feedback on that, so it should be a good game.
Did it feel like Amplitude?
Have you played Amplitude and Frequency?
Did it feel like those games to you?
Yeah, actually, it was pretty similar to that.
I mean, same way, same setup and everything.
Very cool.
It's just that with, I don't know, a guitar.
Okay, that works.
Alright, well, we're going to go ahead and let you go so we can get to some other calls, but thanks for calling in, okay?
I'm glad to hear you had a good time at the show, even though everything was very crowded and you didn't get to play too much, but at least you got to see a lot of cool stuff.
Yeah, yeah, it wasn't bad.
All right.
All right.
All right, take care.
Thank you.
Later.
Let's go to one more call.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Hey, hey, hey, it's Ron John.
Hi, Ron John.
How are you?
Hey, what's up, people?
Hey.
Hey.
Hey, you want to hear a joke?
Yeah, yeah.
Okay.
What do gay horses eat?
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Sorry, anyway.
The funny thing you've mentioned, that has something to do with the con I went to this past, last weekend.
Oh, really?
Yes, we have what was called AnnaFest, which is like a girl celebration type convention.
So, YaoiCon without the Yaoi?
Yeah.
They were actually showing American animation at the con.
Sounds like Total Shoujo Day.
There was actually a shoujo con, but that's it for another story.
But anywho, I was in charge of the masquerade.
I had no staffers.
Okay, so what did you do?
What was your responsibility?
I was in charge of the masquerade and the karaoke.
That whole weekend I got screamed at by the concert because stuff was not running properly.
I was missing stuff.
I was missing that.
I didn't even know I was missing anything.
I didn't even unpack half the stuff that we needed.
It was just crazy.
It was a Saturday, Sunday, Monday convention.
Why do you have a convention on a Monday?
Or was Monday a holiday or something?
AX goes Friday...
Oh, see, that's crazy.
Then again, AX also sucks ass.
Yeah.
As in, A sucks.
Mm-hmm.
I tried to tell them to go Friday, Saturday, Sunday, but they wouldn't want to listen to me.
I guess I haven't been to enough cons to know better.
So what was the highlight of the con?
The masquerade.
Overall, everybody said the con sucked as a whole, but they loved the masquerade.
Especially the power-power skit that was done by my friends.
They did Go Godzilla Go.
Oh, God.
What did they do?
They did the whole Power of Power, um... The whole Power of Power dance to it.
Plus, they had one of my friends, Godzilla, in the background raising their arms back and forth.
Rancha, I want to go to an anime con with you.
I'm telling you, fine.
In May 2007, I'm shooting for... I have an idea for a skit.
Uh-oh.
I want to have a bunch of people do Lodoss War cosplay.
and then do the D&D Satan's Game thing.
What's the con on the East Coast you're trying to get us to come to next year?
Katsukon.
Katsukon.
And when's that?
It's first or second weekend of February.
I have to post information about that in my journal.
Yeah, definitely.
You send me a plane ticket, I'll be there.
I may just come because I want to go to the East Coast.
Anyway, so I may take some time off to go.
So we'll see.
Definitely give me the details.
Yeah, I already put you down in my room for the suite.
Woo!
Woo!
I'll try to go.
Sweet.
And I'll try to bring the bike and costume.
Nice.
Because one of my friends, she runs like a giant Guilty Gear cosplay shoot.
She has like multiple Kai costumes.
I don't know shit about anime, which you'll find out at a convention.
I think that Rob should cosplay Faust.
But I will game geek it up with anybody.
Rob, we're going to make you a costume.
We're going to have you cosplay Faust.
I want to cosplay as a slime from Dragon Quest.
How about Benamaru?
No, I don't think... Rob doesn't have... I don't have the abs for that.
But I think that Rob would make a perfect Faust if there's a Guilty Gear cosplay group.
We should totally imitate the guys who do the same thing at AX every year and have the Shinsengumi running around.
See, on the East Coast, we don't have that.
We have T-shirt ninjas running around.
T-shirt ninjas.
Fun.
No, no, no, no, we need the Turks this year.
Well, I will definitely be planning on trying to come to that con, so any of our East Coast listeners, I want them to go too, so I can meet everybody at once.
Speaking of the Turks, CapsaCon, we're having a massive Advent Children group, and I am crying about it because I saw all the details for Barret.
And what happened?
I shit my pants after seeing that gun arm.
I'm screaming, I have to make that, I have to make that!
You know what?
What?
It's entirely possible.
Just do the metal arm.
I'm doing it.
I think I'll probably stick with the same material I made my original gun arm with, which was PVC.
For those that don't know where Katsukan is, where is it?
Because our chat room is yelling at me.
It's Washington, D.C.
Okay.
This means I have to starve myself for four months if I were to do Tifa.
I could stand to go to Washington, D.C.
It's Washington, D.C., the Omni Sherm Hotel.
I'll cosplay Marlene.
Alright, I'm saving my money right now.
Sweet.
Alright.
And back to Anna, the funniest thing about it, everybody was saying that the con was so gay, and my response was, well, what do you expect?
It was run by a bulldog dyke.
I did that.
I shit you not.
People were saying that the con was so gay, and he says, what do you expect?
It was run by a bulldog dyke.
She's running around with this long-ass mullet, and she has the Qui-Gon Jin braid, too.
I said Star Wars fans would lynch her for that.
I have to find a way there.
I will have to find a way.
All right, Ronshan, we've got to let you go because we've got more show to do, but thanks for the... I'm going to start a PayPal collection, send DarkSakura to the East Coast.
All right.
Oh, Jamie, I have a link to send you later.
It's a tour of all the Ron Nordhapp soundtracks.
Ooh!
Just email that to me.
Of course I will.
Jamie at OrangetownRadio.com.
Have fun, you anime nerds.
Okay.
You shouldn't talk.
Bye.
I know.
Bye.
I shouldn't talk.
I'm on the radio talking about video games.
But to be fair, I also talk about sex.
That's true.
Please shuffle.
All right.
Let's go to a break, kids.
We've got to go to a break because when we come back from the break, we're going to get into the cage match and some other little things.
I do want to take a couple more Skype calls if we have time.
I know there's some more people that want to get through, so I want to entertain that.
But we have our regular segments.
We definitely have to get through first.
So we're going to go to a break, and in this break, I figure we'll start it off with... How about something from EX2?
We haven't played some EX2 stuff in a while.
Actually, that's probably not true.
I know we played some last week, but you know, I want to hear some EX2 stuff.
Just play the music.
That's right, we're going to play the music.
Let's start it off with a little bit of Sneaker Pimps.
We'll be back after this, kids, with more Orange Lounge Radio.
Sneaker Pimps.
Thank you for watching!
Thanks for watching!
Thanks for watching!
Thanks for watching!
Thank you for watching!
Easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song.
Orange Lounge Radio.
We are back on Orange Lounge Radio on this episode 160.
A nice round number there.
That's 8 times 20.
Wait till nine episodes down the road.
I know, 169.
What are we going to do?
We're going to have to invite Mr. Spanky back.
Maybe bring his hag, Betty.
You know who we need?
We need...
I'm just pixie dust!
I miss Pixie Dust 24-Hour Fitness
They actually made a deal with Konami and they're going to be incorporating Dance Dance Revolution arcade machines in the kids clubs portion of 24 Hour Fitness.
In return, Konami is going to put a 30 day pass into the gym in the game.
So like when you buy a copy of DDR, you're going to get a free 30 day pass for 24 Hour Fitness.
Let's see.
Konami Director of Business Partnerships Clara Gilbert said, Bringing the health and fitness benefits of DDR to 24-hour fitness is an unbeatable combination in helping kids and adults stay in shape while having fun.
By placing DDR in 24-hour fitness locations, we strive to help kids and adults achieve their fitness goals in an unintimidating and fun way.
I didn't know that kids go to 24-hour fitness.
I thought that just closeted married men go there.
No, I... And then they just... They should have fuck-fuck resolution.
Resolution.
Revolution.
I remember dance-dance-fuck.
It's fun for the whole family is the idea, Extifer.
Or gay married men.
I don't think that's... Or gay married men.
They're not going to put this in every 24-hour... Gay men can't get married silly.
Yes, they can.
The married kind can.
Anyway...
I just kind of want to point out, what do you guys think?
Good idea, bad idea?
DarkSakura, you're a gym-going member here.
What do you think?
It should go to California Family Fitness.
We have a California Family Fitness nationwide.
So, if you go to California Family Fitness.
Well, they could sign a deal, too, maybe.
I don't know.
Probably not.
So that I can play DDR at my gym.
But you can play DDR at home.
You know, I miss good idea, bad idea.
Okay.
How is the greatest...
Well, is there something you want to say about this, good idea, bad idea-wise?
Good idea, putting DDR in the gyms.
Bad idea, the only DDR they're going to be able to put in the gyms is DDR USA.
Not necessarily.
No, the machines, they're not over here.
They're not supposed to be here.
You know they'll be extremely... Deny everything.
You know, maybe they'll make a new DDR.
Right.
I know, right.
But what about that thing that they were testing?
Remember a while back they were testing something for gyms?
And true, it was supposed to be like a, it had like karate kicks in it and stuff.
I don't remember what was in it.
It was like a multi-person DDR thing, and I don't think it was for kids.
But maybe it's something like that.
Maybe it's a special DDR.
What if the new DDR wasn't for arcades but for 24-hour fitness?
Wouldn't that be hilarious?
We need Patapata in the gym because that's a better workout, I think.
I'm telling you, fuck, fuck, revolution, and it's going to be in the showers, and all the closeted gay guys are going to be all on that.
They're going to be all on that.
Thank you for sharing, Extover.
Oh, no problem.
That's what it was called, DDR Studio.
Somebody mentioned that.
They could take one of the PlayStation 2 games and just put it in a cabinet.
What if they just did that?
What do you think of that, Loki?
Huh?
Crap.
Crap.
What if it was Extreme 2?
Extreme 2 is pretty cool.
It wouldn't work.
Why not?
It'd have to do a new build.
How easily would it be deported?
Extremely.
Why don't they do it then?
They could do it.
Lazy.
They might do it.
I still stand by Potapota in the gym.
Aren't they going to have to edit the game somehow to put the 24-hour fitness logo in it?
Possibly.
So, while they're at it, they can change all the songs and stuff.
I bet you this will be some type of special machine.
Just you wait.
No.
I want to ask you something real quick, Loki, because this is on another subject.
Something that's been going around on the DDR forums.
What's the last you've heard on a release date for Ultramix 3?
Because some people are saying it's been bumped back from the second.
It never was on the second.
Oh, I thought... No, you posted some news article on the website and said it was on the second.
That was a while ago.
No, it's like on the... I don't want to say it's the second week, I think.
It only got pushed back a week.
I mean...
I can't remember if it was the second or third week.
Everything's in the third week.
I mean, there's like 100 games coming out in the third week.
It's just retarded.
But, yeah, if anything, I pushed back only a week or two.
And it was, I think, relatively around the same.
I think some folks are saying the 16th now, like two weeks later.
It would make sense.
Everything's coming out on the 16th.
Everything.
I mean, just too many games.
I can confirm that because of the tournament that we're working on that I have had no time to work on.
Okay.
Very interesting.
I just wanted to clear that up, because I know it was on some web forums, and I was like, well, Loki did say that, like, five months ago, so it might be different now.
It was a while ago.
Of course they're going to move the date around.
I haven't updated on every single thing I hear about, you know, so.
Well, you might want to post a little update to our thing.
Well, I don't want to, like, update it.
Okay, yeah, now it's coming out this day.
For all those people waiting for Advent Children at the end of January now, so.
Yeah.
All right.
Let's go to the cage match.
You guys ready for this?
Yeah, because I actually kept my promise.
Goody, goody, goody, I'm so excited.
Okay, in the meantime, while I'm setting up cage match, DarkSakura, why don't you plug some of the other great programming we have here on Orange Launch Radio.
You mean Pump Up the Volume, which is every other week?
Yes.
It's supposed to be on Tuesdays, Pump Up the Volume, where I play...
X to First Case of the Mondays
Woo!
And aren't we supposed to do a fuck-off show?
Like, weren't we supposed to do that?
Like, but it was too late.
We need to do a fuck-off show.
Yeah, that would be really cool.
What is the fuck-off show?
That's when we get really bored and just randomly do shows.
Come on the air and just fuck off?
I want a fuck-on show.
Fuck-on, fuck-off, the fucker.
Alright, you guys ready for tonight's cage match?
Oh, I don't know Rob Roberts, are we?
I think we are.
Okay.
The Way the Cage Match Works, we're going to play three songs for you guys.
Last week's winner and two brand new songs, as chosen by our hosts.
And you're going to vote for your favorite, and the winning song goes into rotation all week long here on Orange Lounge Radio's Bomani and Video Game Music programs.
Alright, we're going to start it off tonight with last week's winner.
Last week, I let Miklatov pick a song for me, because I was constantly losing the cage match, and go figure, the damn song won.
And he still hates me this week over the World of Warcraft thing.
The bastard.
So let's see if it wins the second week in a row.
It's a little drum and bass-y song.
The song is called Hold Your Color, and it's by a group called Pendulum, and it's song number one tonight.
Enjoy.
Okay, that was song number one in tonight's Cage Match.
Pendulum with Hold Your Color.
I love something that can hold.
All right.
We're going to get into song number two tonight in tonight's Cage Match, and song number two is actually going to be Loki's pick.
Loki, what did you pick for us tonight?
I figured if we can't beat him, join him.
So we have also from the Hold Your Color album by Pendulum, track two, which is...
Actually, take that back.
Make it track 9 out here.
Oh, god damn you.
You can't change on me.
Yes, I can.
Fine.
Track 9.
All right.
Can you do this?
Is this legal in the cage match rulebook?
The bylaws?
That you can put in a song by the same artist?
I protest vehemently.
Just to spite the person who won?
Yes.
Bastard.
I hate you.
Alright, so it's out here.
Song number two in tonight's cage match, Pendulum with Out Here.
Enjoy it.
Thanks for watching!
Thank you for watching!
On song number two tonight, Pendulum with Out Here was the name of that song.
Let's go around and see what everybody thought of song number two, which, by the way, was the same artist as song number one, you bastard.
DarkSakura.
I really liked it, but it made me think of music from Tekken 5 and Tekken 4.
I really liked that game, but it just... You know, it was really... It was good, but it seemed very long.
I mean, at...
I really like it a lot.
But there's something that bugs me about it that I can't really put my finger on.
It gives a 9.
It's pretty good.
Loki.
It was really cool.
I like the album because I acquired it after listening to the song on last week's episode.
So yeah, it gives a 9.
By the way, totally off topic, and I just remembered this when she was talking about puppies.
I was walking through Kings Beach and they had a store called Dog Baker and I thought, Amal, do they bake dogs there?
I'm like, that's pretty wrong.
No, I know what that place is.
They make dog biscuits.
They cook puppies.
Extra firm.
Uh, 10.
That song was music to fuck to.
I really, really enjoyed that song.
It was a good sex song.
Um, and, uh, you know, Shane has good taste in music.
Don't, God, don't inflate his ego.
God, don't.
No, no, no, no, no.
I'm just gonna say, he's serving as an inspiration behind the first song that I'm gonna play on my show, X the First Case of the Mondays, airing a week from tomorrow.
Okay.
My thoughts on the song.
My song was better.
It really was.
That was too slow and mellow, and you should vote for mine instead, because that one was too... I went to sleep.
I agree, your song was better.
But see, the thing is, though, I had to put a song in now so that I can make the final modifications for the song next week.
I give that song a two for the number of Pendulum songs we have in Cage Match tonight, and because mine was better.
Come on, Jamie, put in a Pendulum song.
Angel, your thoughts.
Your rating.
There we go.
I don't know.
I'll give it a 10.
Just because I like it.
I like it a lot.
I was going to say good music to... Have sex to?
No.
Good music to... Have sex to?
Digitally pee to?
Paint.
Paint.
You sick people.
I don't know about your water sports, Angel, but... DarkSakura!
Jesus.
What do you have for us tonight?
Did you make good on your thread?
I said I was going to put ABBA in, but I forgot that I can't find my copy of ABBA Gold.
So I put an ABBA cover in.
So this is, I don't know if this is the 18th, because it said it was the 18th.
Yes, it's the 18th.
But it's the erotic remix of SOS.
Which I have a feeling is a false labeling, because I do not know of any time erotic actually mixed the songs.
This could actually just be the erotic version for all we know.
It could be, but that's how I've had it for years, and I never knew the difference.
So some type of remix of SOS by ABBA, one way or another.
Yeah, I said I would put in ABBA, this is something ABBA.
Alright, here it is.
Where are those happy days that seem so hard to find?
I tried to reach for you, but you have closed your mind Whatever happened to our love, I wish I understood It used to be so nice, it used to be so good So when you need me darling, can't you hear me S.O.S. ?
How can I even try to go on When you're gone and gone
I wish I understood
When you're gone, when you're gone, how can I even try to know why?
When you're gone, when you're gone, no one's right, how can I even know why?
Oh, when you hear me darling, can't you hear me SOS?
Alright, that was song number three in tonight's cage match, the 18th... Oh, crap.
Wham, just like totally crashed on me.
That was weird.
Wow.
Dead air.
That's not good.
Shit.
Okay, well, let's go around and see what everybody thought of, um, we'll just have to not have background music right now.
Or maybe you can have explosive diarrhea.
Yeah, let's do that, let's do that.
Since you said shit.
Ass.
Alright, let's go around and see what everybody thought of that song.
Um, song number three, uh, 18s with S.O.S., starting off with Dark Sakura.
Um, I Need Help, S.O.S.
Okay.
Um, I actually like that song, um, so it gets an eight.
Okay.
Loki.
I didn't like it.
It's just not for me.
It's too, I don't know, too happy.
Too gay.
Yes, it's too gay.
It's too flaming gay.
That's why I don't like the song.
It's too sky.
Let's check and see what DRUK has to say about sim updates.
Great radio.
Hey, listen, okay, if something actually happened in the sim world, I would know about it.
Sakurina says they have some news.
What, okay, whatever.
What news do you have?
I don't know, I'm waiting to see.
In today's news, people smoked crack.
So anyways, yeah.
Yeah.
I got nothing.
I'm tallying cage match votes, you guys need to figure out if they're kind.
I got nothing, but no, um, no really.
As far as official sim files go, um...
Still working on the official stuff.
Looks like to me, though, that they're probably not done.
Okay, Socorino, what Socorino wanted to share is that the VJ Army forums are starting their own collection of Stepmania sim files for Happy Sky.
The whole community.
That's the big news.
Wow.
Okay.
There you have it.
Hooray!
More step files for Beatmania songs.
Just what we needed.
We don't have any of those.
We've never had those before.
What's Beatmania?
Beatmania, 2DX, whatever you want to call it.
Is that when you turn into a maniac and beat someone?
Yes.
Did you want me to say Hip Hop Mania?
Everybody loves the Hip Hop Mania.
I remember that thing.
Hip Hop Mania rocks.
Yo.
We're going to go break.
Diggity.
When we come back for the break, we're going to announce tonight's Cage Match winner, and we're going to get into the FUs of the week, because I know you kids are angsty, and Xtrafer wants to give a movie review, although I didn't think he saw anything this week, so I'm going to be a little bit surprised, surely.
All right, so we'll be back after this.
We're going to start it off with a little bit of, I think we'll start off with some Daikinkai.
How's that sound?
We'll be back after this.

Thank you for watching!

Thanks for watching!
Thank you for watching!
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Thank you for watching!
Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.
Extreme Bomani Radio.
That's us, Orange Lounge Radio.
You know that movie was on TV today.
Well, that sounds awfully a lot like Jamie there in the promo.
Do we want people to kiss our ass?
Yes!
Absolutely.
We love it when people kiss our ass.
But not literally.
You can kiss our ass.
Kissing ass is good.
You can kiss our ass.
I only like it when it's my husband.
Oh, okay.
No!
You can kiss our ass by voting us a five on your player window or voting us on Podcast Alley because she knows no one else did this month.
That makes me sad, people.
Kiss our ass.
or you can shut the fuck up you are so fired I can really do gay really well Rob Roberts tell us what's next you shouldn't talk like that always no I'd kill you I really would I would just take you out back if you start going super then I'm gonna cry can you imagine every morning good morning there's too many gay jokes on tonight's show hello Rob we need to tone it down
Oh, okay, dude.
There you go.
That's better.
We need a gay promo.
No, we don't.
Yes, we do.
Listen to Orange Lounge.
All right.
I guess this show is only going to get gayer because we are going to allow Extifer to do his movie review.
Don't play the music.
I just, I don't know.
I don't know about that.
All right, what did you see this week?
Well, I didn't see it this week, but I just thought, I mean, it was kind of like a spur-of-the-moment idea that I would review Deep Impact.
Because Gene Shalit of Today called it a thriller with brains.
And Jeffrey Lyons of NBC TV said it was exhilarating, the special effects highlight of the year.
Which really nobody saw Deep Impact because they all saw that other one.
I saw Deep Impact in the theater.
I did too.
Actually, I liked it better than the other one.
What's it called?
Armageddon.
I was going to say Asteroid, but that was the one on TV.
I liked Deep Impact because Taya Leone died in it.
And sorry to ruin it for you, but she died in it and I hate her.
Dan says they're doing one about hurricanes called Category 7.
I'm like, that's insulting.
So, Extrovert, what do you think of it?
Well, I think it was a good movie.
I think it was kind of cheesy or whatever, but I thought it had a little bit more drama in it than the other movie, Armageddon.
Drama!
Yeah, drama.
It had some drama in it, and we all loved it.
We all ate it up.
No, but it was really good.
I think there should be a porn called Deep Impact, and if there hasn't been yet, I think they should make one.
because then it would be like about a giant cock headed towards some unsuspecting guy's anus and then, you know, he can't escape it and there's going to be a white wave at the end of the movie.
What do you think, Rob?
I think it's a seller.
I think you're an asshole.
You know, people make, it's a billion dollar industry, the porn business and I mean, a lot of people buy that gay porn
Even straight guys I think that gay porn is funny I think that all porn is funny It's great Hello, it's great This is all about Jeff Stryker He's kind of gay for pay But he's funny
He is funny because he's like, oh, I want to do you.
He's hilarious.
And then you hear a horse go in the background.
I think that he's hilarious.
Have you seen that scene yet?
No, I haven't.
I should show it to you.
I need to.
It's great.
Are you doing a movie review?
Oh, Deep Impact.
Rent it.
Buy it.
I don't know.
Like, it's probably on eBay for like two bucks.
I mean, you may be able to get it, pick it up at Walmart in their bargain bin.
Is it called a bargain bin?
The $5 bin, maybe.
Watch it with your kids.
I have nothing.
Vote for song number two.
And fuck to it.
Alright, let's see tonight's winner of the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match.
Speaking of which, it's a little late to have your plug in there because we already have a winner for tonight's Cage Match.
Are you ready to find out who it is?
The winner of tonight's Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match is...
Where's the song?
Oh, here it is.
Song number one.
Pendulum Hold Your Color wins song number one.
Loki, suck it, Loki.
I mean, I could take him.
I could take Rob.
Suck it.
More ABBA next week.
More Pendulum next week.
Great.
Yeah, I'll have to counteract that with an echo image.
DarkSakura, why is it that we do the FUs of the week every single week?
Oh, by the way, kids, you can send in your FUs to me right now, but keep them short!
Why is it we do the FUs of the week every single week?
FU to old people who think that they have perfect night vision and can drive.
No, you really can't.
You suck.
Um...
F you to being busy and F you to my medication that I can't really go into too much detail about on the air.
F you to hormones.
I'm done.
Let's get to Loki's F yous.
My F yous first begins with the Hyatt at Lake Tahoe.
Fuck you to their service because it sucks.
First they gave me the wrong room with the wrong bed in it.
Then they tried to charge me $3 for something that was supposedly taken out of the minibar despite the fact that they never gave me the key for the minibar and it was zip-tied shut.
So that would have been some magic.
Anyways, also fuck you to having to make the two-hour drive to Lake Tahoe.
I was actually driving around on the weekend and there's these stupid people in SUVs trying to tailgate me
along these roads that are really windy and stuff, and the speed limit's only 45 anyways, and the guy is driving down the center line, because he's trying to pass me on double yellow, so fuck you to the fucking SUV drivers.
At least, though, they're in Tahoe, where there are actual hills and snow, so SUVs are allowed there, but yeah, they still suck.
And finally, just fuck you to the fact that I was actually bored enough to bid on some item on eBay for God knows how much money
and now I have this stupid poster that may be autographed by the entire cast of True Crimes New York but now I have this thing that I paid way too much money for and it sucks.
But at least it went to charity so I guess that's okay but still too much money spent this weekend and fuck you the Hyatt again for having their slots being way too damn tight.
It's just like playing in any casino so fuck them.
That's all I have.
I'm actually really not that angsty, all things considered.
I am really angsty at one situation right now, but I can't talk about it on air.
But it's something related to something I can't go to, that I wanted to go to, and now I can't go to it.
And that makes me upset, because I don't like it when I don't get my way.
So F you to me not getting my way.
And an F you to traffic on Watt Avenue the other day, because it was stupid.
And...
An F you to candy corn, because it's really addicting.
But you know what's even more addicting than candy corn?
It's that Indian corn, the one that tastes like chocolate.
This shit is so good.
I'm telling you, this shit is so good.
Just don't eat candy.
I can't do that.
They make sugar-free candy corn, by the way.
Ooh, maybe, now that maybe I could do.
But it makes you take a shit really bad if you eat too much of it.
At least I'd lose weight.
That's it.
Extaper, let's get to you F yous tonight.
uh f you fuck you to me because I keep talking about sex I need to get laid and I I'm just talking about it way too much um so yeah fuck fuck you to me hopefully soon um and yeah I think that's pretty much it and I know there was something I was thinking about and I can't remember it so on to Angel Angel
I have viewed my computer deciding to kill itself during a Scarlet Monastery run, which I don't know if you guys have all gotten that high or not, but yeah, that wasn't cool when it did that, because I had other stuff to do this weekend after I was playing World of Warcraft, so luckily it died after my portfolio was due for school, so.
Let's get into the chatroom FUs.
Sephiroth1215 wants to give an FU to Digital Life doing everything on Saturday leaving me with nothing cool and not one thing to do without waiting an hour just to play a new SNK game or a new Sonic game.
The only games I actually wanted to play other than the ones I already did.
Ron Chan would like to say an FU to Cablevision for coming to an install to replace a cable modem.
Something that I could have done myself.
I didn't need to be up at 8am for this.
NintendoManiac64 says F you to myself for not even touching my homework yet and it's like midnight here on the east coast F you to our new Netgear wireless router that killed the internet on one of our computers and required a reformat to get the router to work F you to my laptop for not being able to run Quake 2 using OpenGL at a smooth speed
Tomo-kun says, fuck my friend for overdosing on a ton of nutmeg last night at the homecoming dance.
She knew she was allergic to it, and then it makes you more sick than high.
It was attempted suicide.
Wow, fuck you for attempting suicide by overdoing something you're allergic to.
And then he said don't read something, but I did, I'm sorry.
Dark Knight says, F you to returning to work today and almost died of heat exhaustion.
And F you for my vacation coming to an end.
Jaded 2005 says, F you to my internet for dying during the cage match.
Sakarina says, F you to my teachers for only putting 10% of the marks that should be on my midterm report card.
I'm not complaining about the actual marks that are there, but the ones that aren't there.
Miklatov says, F you to me for giving up Taco Bell.
If you know me in person, you know how big of a deal this is.
Extrovert just gasped.
Hahaha.
FU also to Milpitas Golf Land because that place is too ghetto to house a perfectly lovely pump exceed machine.
But there was a guy that liked you at the one that we have over here.
DarkLionXVI says one FU for tonight.
FU to Cox Communications for charging 75 bucks just to change the splitter that connects both my TV and cable modem.
A few days later, I'm still getting disconnects due to line and signal issues.
DarkTetsuya says F you to my crappy connection as always and F you to Squeenix for not giving me my slime keychain with my DQ8 demo.
Goggle says, and I almost said Google, but I stopped myself.
Goggle says, froke everyone at the homecoming dance for stopping when Dancing Queen came on.
Just because it's not rap doesn't mean he can't dance.
Hey, I would have danced to Dancing Queen.
It says dancing in its name.
I would have danced to that.
I would have danced to it.
You know what I played at my first homecoming dance?
It just dates me.
The Humpty Dance.
It's your chance.
I don't remember what they played.
A lot of Nirvana.
Because my first homecoming was in 1990.
Oh, I didn't go to my homecoming dance.
No, I didn't go to the prom.
I was at Red Robin last night watching all the people in their dresses, and it was like a fashion show.
Fuck all those anorexic skinny people.
Goggle, invite us to the prom next time, and we'll dance to Dancing Queen with you.
Oh my god, I would so go to the prom.
Oh, I didn't see this.
I should.
SSJ100 Matt says F you to the Yankees for being knocked out of the playoffs Go White Sox F you to this show turning into Prawn Lounge Radio He he We're horny No apologies GS191 says Excuse me F you to my online class for fucking up again and making me retake midterms again F you to my online class period Online plus math equals bad
And lastly, but not leastly, Roz says, F you to my health teacher for accusing me of plagiarism.
Well, it's not healthy.
I double F you that because it's crappy.
You know what else?
You know what?
It's something about science teachers are total cunts.
I'll tell you why.
Because, like, I had a ball.
I don't care if I drop the C ball.
This guy deserves it.
My least favorite teacher of all time.
The Vampire Bat is a bat from Mexico.
We were all going around and what he did is he said, I'm going to give you three extra credit points after we handed in all our papers.
He says, I want to know what you really learned and I'm going to give you three extra credit points if you memorize the scientific name of your animal.
Well, I knew mine and I said it out loud.
He said, great, you get the three extra credit points.
Unfortunately, I'm going to flunk you on the paper.
In fact, the whole class he said this, I'm going to flunk you on the paper because your animal is not from North America.
That's bullshit.
I said, that's bullshit.
Mexico is in North America.
He says, no, that's Central America.
I said, I took him to task on this.
I said, what do you call the North American Free Trade Agreement, which involves Canada, US, and Mexico?
And I still, I didn't get it.
I just finally... That's fucking... I got a D. I got a D. You got a D. I got a D on the report.
I would have taken it to the principal.
I would have done it too.
I should have, but I... I have done that to teachers.
When I was a child, I was too passive.
I'm sorry if your teaching staff here is fucking incompetent, but... I will never forget that to this day, and this is why I hate biology.
That one incident is why I hate biology.
Your science teacher was a moron, because even named by the continents, Central America is just...
Talk to the principal!
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
And he died.
Karma, motherfucker.
You know what I feel so bad about during my high school years is because there was a teacher, my data processing teacher, who was going to flunk me on something, some random thing that I kind of stood up for myself for, and I yelled at the guy.
It was the only teacher that, well, one of the two teachers I yelled at my whole time going to school.
A couple years later, he died.
I don't know if he's...
He was a bastard, so he's probably in hell.
So I guess I should look down and say, hey, how's it going?
I'll see you in a couple years.
God, don't say that.
In a few years.
There's a few years on me.
The sad thing is my biology teacher was really old.
He is probably dead.
You know what I'm sad about?
He's been like ten years since high school.
You know what I'm sad about?
What?
That we haven't done a match game.
I know, we're not going to get to it either, probably.
Oh, darn!
I haven't written questions, so I'll write questions for next week, and we'll get to it for sure.
Anyway, so, now, the ironic thing is I'm a teacher now.
I just don't teach high school kids, but I teach... You teach something worse.
I teach adults, which is much worse in some scenarios, but, you know, for the most part, it's okay.
Actually, when I'm in class, everything is great.
It's everything I have to deal with outside of class that irks me, usually.
When I'm in class, everything's fine.
And I actually taught Extifer...
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
I would suggest things that might not have been in the material that they would need to know.
You know, that's how I got into training, though, where I work, is that I was sitting in the class as a student.
I was suggesting how to make it better, and that impressed the trainer, and she suggested I should be in it.
See, HR positions aren't opening up in my work, so I'm going into compliance if I get the job.
I want to be in HR.
That's one of my things.
I really do want to be in HR.
Well, this is great and all, but let's get into another statement.
So back to HR.
I want to be in it.
Yeah, you want to be all up in it, I'm sure.
Let's get back to Angel's water sports.
Humpin' resources.
Huh?
Humpin' resources.
The Humpty Dance resources.
All right.
I want to get back to Angel's water sports.
I don't want to get back into Angel's water sports.
Oh, okay, then we don't have to get to your water sports.
She's doing the blink thing, where she's like, blink, blink, what?
I like alcohol.
Alcohol makes you pee, and peeing has to do with Angel's water sports.
How about that, Angel?
No, but Jamie is the only one that successfully got me to drink liquor once.
That was cool.
Yeah.
I'm going to bring over some sake one day.
And did you pee?
Can I bring up an actually relevant Bomani story real quick?
Sure, Rod!
Okay, we're going to go to break and we're going to come back and do Ask Orange Lounge because the chat room is begging for it tonight.
Somebody gave me a link to this and I don't remember who now.
Oh, it was Goggle.
Goggle gave me this.
Thank you, Goggle.
Thank you for watching!
and it has to do with the Serious Games Summit.
Seriously, you guys, serious.
No, what it is, actually, it's going to be a, I guess, kind of summit thing going on.
It's actually going to happen in Washington, D.C.
at the Serious Games Summit and it's going to be Monday, October 31st.
Hey, that's Halloween.
From 4.15 p.m.
to 5.15 p.m.
It's a, like, session on...
Dance Dance Revolution, the most researched serious game ever.
Why and what have we learned?
And here's what it says on the little website synopsis.
DDR is a game, a social activity, a dance and performance platform, a community, a form of vigorous exercise, a weight loss tool, and more.
It serves different needs for different people and it has been put to many surprising uses.
This talk analyzes, or as I like to say, analyzes,
the appeal of DDR and the many ways it has been implemented and researched as a serious game.
It reviews current research finding and then examines the exergaming phenomenon in general and where it is heading.
And I bet you we won't be mentioned at all.
Dude, that's insulting because we're fabulous.
We are the backbone of the DDR community.
We are totally the backbone of the DDR community.
I mean, I know you're a moderator on DDR Freak and all, but
You know, DDR Freak was the backbone, I guess we're the tailbone.
DDR Freak, let's face it, DDR Freak jumped the shark a little while ago.
I can make no comment about that, sir.
DDR Freak jumped the shark a couple years ago.
I can make no comment about that, sir.
I like DDR Freak.
I'm not the UK form.
I know you do.
I love the UK form.
They jumped the shark.
Hey, UK form, I love you guys.
You're well behaved now.
We are the backbone of the DDR community.
You know what, actually, we're the backbone of the entire video gaming community, really.
Because we are the number one rated podcast.
I don't know about that, but we managed to win an award, and we're cool.
Adam Curry digs us.
That's right, Adam Curry likes us.
I like his hair.
Adam Curry, if you're listening, I want to know what hairstyle he has.
I'm sure Adam Curry's listening.
He's got nothing better to do than say, oh, I'm going to listen to Orange Lingerie tonight.
He's probably listening to his old tapes that he did, you know, DJing on MTV or whatever.
I like Adam Curry.
I had such a thing for Adam Curry when I was younger.
Really?
I kind of liked him too when I was younger.
And Colin Quinn, actually, because I liked his jaw.
If somebody would go to this lecture and tape it for us and get us a CD so we can mock it on air, that would be great.
No, I'm sure it will be interesting.
I'm curious to see what they have to say.
We'll see.
Alright, we'll be back after this.
We're going to take a quick Tucson break, then we're going to do some Ask Orange Lounge.
So send in your questions right now, kids.
We'll be back after this.
Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.
We're back on Orange Lounge Radio.
And we're going to get into a little segment here you guys know and love.
We're getting a lot of questions tonight, too, so we've got to get right into it.
It's Ask Orange Lounge.
Don't forget our podcast, boys and girls, which we do every week.
www.orangeloungeradio.com Click on the to-go edition.
Are you okay?
What the hell?
I'm making funny faces.
Why are you making faces?
Because I can.
We're going to do some Ask Orange Lounge.
Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.
What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?
Perhaps a question we will find the answer to is why Jamie is smiling when she comes out of the bathroom.
I am still going to kick you.
She's going to cut you.
I'm good.
Squeeze the ferret to death.
Nintendo Maniac 64 says, For the cage match, why can't there be a member chosen from each week and they get to submit one song to the cage match for the next week?
We do things like that occasionally, but it's our show and not your show.
And that's basically the main reason why.
No, in all seriousness.
Like, I let Mikulatov pick one, so sometimes, and sometimes, like, one of us won't be here, and we'll forget to have submitted a cage match song, so we'll just pick a random chatter to send a song.
So it does happen once in a while, it's just not a regular thing.
The cage match is long enough as it is, we don't want to add another song to it.
Uh, NintendoManiac64 also wants to know, we're gonna have time for some more Skype, right?
I just downloaded it and got it working, and I'm, like, uber excited for it.
Um, maybe.
Maybe.
Jaded2005 says, oh, this is actually a good question.
Jaded2005 wants to know, how did you first get into DDR?
Um, may I?
You may.
I was going to Anime Expo.
This was in 96?
No, no, no, no, no, no.
It was after that.
It was like 98 was my first Anime Expo.
And I got into Best Move right after that.
And then I went to...
Anime Expo the next year, which was AX99, and someone had the first DDR for PlayStation there.
And I was in the middle of the Busted Move 2 tournament, which really pissed me off, because I was beating everybody for a solid hour, and then decimated my first guy, got to the second guy, and got a faulty controller.
I was also cosplaying Shorty that year.
but I thought it was really cool because I heard KC and the Sunshine Band and so I had to get my own copy so I got my first DDR that I ever owned was like a burn of the first one and then I got a DDR for Dreamcast and then I played my first machine at the next AX which was a third mix so AX2000 was my first machine and AX99 was my first time playing DDR but I actually played Beatmania before that
and I played Dance Dance Dance, which sucked.
The first time I ever saw DDR was at Milpitas Golf Land and it was the same weekend I lost my virginity.
Just thought you'd like to know.
Can you describe that to us in detail?
Yes, actually.
First, no, I'm not going to.
You can't describe your DDR experience?
That's what I was asking.
I mean, why would I ask you to describe your first experience anal sex-wise?
Shut up.
God, take his mic away.
Do it.
This time don't give it back.
This time don't give it back.
How I got into DDR was I moved in with my roommate.
I was a fan of me.
I saw Beatmania one year and DDR the next year.
Bought both games and continue not to play them today.
I have a whole pile of 5 key Beatmanias that I don't play.
But yeah, for some reason I'm going to spend the money to build an arcade pad in... Oh, I already built arcade pads for DDR.
An arcade setup for Beatmania.
I don't know why.
Alright, Socorina has a couple questions we're going to run through here.
Socorina wants to know, when was the last time each Orange Lounge Radio crew member got a Brazilian wax?
Never.
Never.
Never.
Never.
I said I don't shave my genitals.
It's not a shave.
Who gave him the mic back?
Who?
Who did that?
Loki did.
You were responsible for keeping the microphone safe from his blasphemy.
Sakurina also wants to know, can Mr. Spanky get back on the show soon?
Blast for me, blast for you.
Yes, Mr. Spanky can come back on the show someday.
I don't know about soon.
We don't want him to jump the shark, but he'll be back.
We need Betty to come.
Can Xtifer get the mic back and start another sex-related joke for this week?
No, he can't.
You can next week.
Tomo Kun wants to know, what's your worst homecoming memory?
Junior homecoming, which I showed up for 30 minutes.
My date had a mullet, and I left.
I actually don't have negative homecoming stories to tell.
For the most part, they were pretty good.
You know, I first kissed a girl my freshman year at homecoming.
I had the flu for prom.
Why are you laughing at that, extrovert?
Because... I just want to know what went through that girl's mind when she kissed you.
Like, oh, that's more of a friend.
That's not a boyfriend.
Like, I don't know.
My mind...
It's gone.
Anyways.
No, actually, my ex, she sucked because she was... She wouldn't put out.
Well, that too, but no.
She was kind of... She played soccer and she injured her knee like four fucking years ago or something like that.
So, for whatever reason, it conveniently acted up whenever she'd go to a dance and she sucked.
So, anyways, the hell with her.
Gago wants to know, on the Serious Games Summit thing, just an aside, apparently my uncle is speaking that day on another topic.
I'll see if I can persuade him to go to the DDR thing.
Let us know if they're doing, like, because usually those Summit-type things, they sell CDs or something, but they're usually really expensive, but you never know.
We might be able to get a deal or something.
So that's cool.
Good luck to your uncle on whatever topic he's speaking on.
Did you both put on, like, lip gloss before you guys kissed?
Will you shut up?
Oh, my God.
Loki, kiss.
Loki.
Hold on to the mic.
Put on my lip gloss.
Okay.
Take the mic away.
Take the mic away.
My name is Rob Roberts.
Kiss me.
I'm just going to unplug it.
I'm just going to unplug him from the board so he can't speak.
No, let's cut it back.
Okay, good.
And you're giving him his own show?
Shame on you.
You know what?
I don't have to be here.
Nobody has to listen if they don't want to.
But if... Actually, he looks all offended.
Look.
Out the window?
Here's the thing though, if Extraverse Show gets lower ratings than Diversion did, which is going to be very hard to do, if Extraverse Show gets lower ratings than Diversion did, you are getting cancelled.
No!
RadioShack, $5.
Yeah, they're actually really cheap.
You can get a nice little headset at Target for $19.99, and that would be headphones with a little mic thing, which is good for TeamSpeak and stuff.
Actually, Office Depot was clearing out the Alta Glancing ones for $10, and Alta Glancing is really good.
Shop around.
If you're interested in buying on the Internet, check out Google's search thing.
I know that's kind of ironic that I'm telling you to go to Google, but they have that compare prices thing that's really cool.
I recommend if you're going to buy a...
Computer thing, make it a brand name like Logitech or something.
Greeny wants to know, do any of you play double mode?
Have you rolled up the king yet?
Can you substitute sound effects to bleep out profanity in the future?
Question number one, do any of you play on double mode?
I used to, but I'm too fat now.
DarkSakura, you used to play on double mode too, right?
Still do?
Actually, I used to do nothing but doubles for a little while.
That's all I play.
Loki, yeah, you play a lot of doubles, Loki.
Yeah, even now that I have, like, no stamina, I still play doubles, because singles is just not for me.
Ironic, we all play doubles.
That's kind of weird.
It's not at home, because, you know, I don't... Yeah, not at home, not at home, I only do it in the arcade.
That's kind of weird.
Have you rolled up the king yet?
No, in fact, I haven't played Katamari Damashii in a little while.
Anybody else, have you rolled up the king yet?
I have had no time to play.
I'm only playing the Japanese version for some reason.
Can you substitute sound effects to bleep out profanity in the future?
Dude, it's the motherfucking internet and we're going to say what we want.
And we don't have a delay to that.
Yeah, we don't have a delay or anything either.
Yeah, and you know who we would put in charge of the delay if we had one?
Exifer.
And you know that wouldn't work.
Ron Chan wants to know, how come you guys don't play the full versions of the songs that are in DDR, 2DX, and so forth?
We have.
We have in the past, and you hear that sometimes on the spin-off shows, but there's only been one lately, and she likes to play non-DDR stuff on her show, but she will once in a while, right?
I actually have done all the money shows, and I've played the long versions.
And every so often I sneak in the Korean stuff.
SSJ100, Matt wants to know, which would you rather see remade on a next-gen console, Chrono Trigger or Final Fantasy VII?
Neither.
Guardian Legend.
Yeah, Guardian Legend.
But if I had to choose between the two?
Yeah, if I had to choose between the two?
I would say Final Fantasy VII so that it actually looks good.
because Chrono Trigger was already perfect.
I'm going to say Chrono Trigger because I did not get into Chrono Trigger when it was on the Super Nintendo.
I never got what the big deal was about Chrono Trigger.
I mean, it was cool and all, but I did not nearly obsess over that game.
I think a remake might help kick my ass a little bit into giving it a second look.
I would have beaten Chrono Trigger.
I've gotten like seven of the 14 endings.
I got the Toriyama ending.
That was pretty cool.
Anybody else want to share what they would see remade on the next-gen console, Chrono Trigger or Final Fantasy VII?
Both can be remade anyways.
Chrono Trigger's going to be an MMO, and Final Fantasy VII's being remade for the PS3, so you'll get them both.
Leadfoot wants to know, should I buy In the Groove or just stick with DDR Extreme 2?
Well, if you are choosing between those two, buy Extreme 2, definitely.
If you're just kind of bored with Extreme 2 and you want a new game, I'm cool with In the Groove.
Pump it up.
Oh yeah, Pump It Up first though, honestly.
Buy Pump It Up before you buy In The Groove.
Seriously, Pump It Up's a great game.
If you get bored of those, go play Step Mania.
Then you could buy In The Groove.
In The Groove will hold you over.
It will.
Zaku says, here's a cool fact about this weekend's DDR tournament.
No more questions, guys.
No more questions.
Final call for questions.
Here's a cool fact about this weekend's DDR tournament that you probably didn't know.
There was one event called Iron Man in which you had to do an Oni course without the bar.
It was done on a DDR machine ghetto rigged to a PS2, both screen and pad, so folks had to do max period on an arcade pad.
Yikes.
Ron Chan says, do you like this as the name of your spin-off show?
The Sky Effect.
I liked, somebody suggested This Week in Sky as a parody of This Week in Tech.
I should do This Week in Sky.
Although it would sound like something that would be exploring like me and I don't know about that.
The Life Aquatic with Rob Roberts.
How about We've Blown It Sky High.
Alright, we're done with that story.
You know, I'm not going to say anything crude.
I just thought that The Life Aquatic starring Rob Roberts would be a good title.
The Life Bimonic.
The Life Bimonic.
Yeah.
And my show is not going to be crude, by the way.
I mean, I may say some crude things, but just listen in.
It'll be fun.
Alright.
Final thoughts?
Say something good about it, Rob.
It's going to be fabulous.
When I say fabulous, I mean stupid.
I'm just kidding.
It'll be fine.
Lip gloss!
It's going to be...
It's going to be interesting.
It's going to be interesting.
Cool.
Like picking your nose and eating it.
That's interesting, too.
I wouldn't... I'd rather do a Brazilian wax job.
Alright.
It's 9.30, we've got to get final thoughts.
Final thoughts, Angel, your final thought.
Thanks for being here and not filling this show with sexual innuendo like Extover.
Why would I... Except that water sports thing, that was hella gross.
That was his fault.
What's your final thought?
My PC must work.
Extover, your final thought.
Orange Lounge Radio, a week from tomorrow.
Extover's Case of the Mondays.
You'll have it.
I might catch something else.
Queer guy's voice for the straight guy's ear.
And girls.
Loki, your final thought.
You should name your show Bad Dude with Sky.
Are you a bad enough dude to eat a cheeseburger?
I'll just call my show The Guardian Legend.
It'd be awesome.
My final thought is... The Eggplant Wizard.
My final thought is I'm sorry that we didn't get to open up the skyplane again.
We ran out of time by talking about us and fucking letting Christopher talk.
Just kidding.
DarkSakura, your final thought.
Reject false icons and remember it's down the road, not across the street, kids.
Do it right.
That's it.
One word of the show to sum everything up.
One word.
Final word of the show.
Angel, I'm going to give it to you.
Final word.
What is it?
Water sports.
Wow.
And now, here is your fortune cookie message of the day.
America, fuck yeah, coming again to save the motherfucking day, yeah.
America, fuck yeah, freedom is the only way, yeah.
Terrorists, your game is through.
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.
End of line.
That's it.
Show's over.
I'm going home.
Reconnect to the stream in about 15 seconds for Bomani music and video game music.
Thanks for listening!
