19
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:47,365
[SPEAKER_06]: But we're not going to have a funeral tonight.

20
00:05:47,385 --> 00:05:48,246
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to have a funeral.

21
00:05:48,506 --> 00:05:50,368
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that's the Orange Lounge Radio way after all.

[SPEAKER_06]: And we have some other big news regarding interactivity with the show.

[SPEAKER_06]: And of course some other Bomani news.

24
00:05:56,132 --> 00:05:58,774
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, the same crap you've come to know and love.

25
00:05:58,894 --> 00:06:00,555
[SPEAKER_06]: Because Captain Jack would have wanted it that way.

26
00:06:00,655 --> 00:06:01,376
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll be back after this.

27

[SPEAKER_32]: Orange Lounge may contain plenty of... Just kidding.

35
00:07:28,718 --> 00:07:32,420
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge Radio will not contain any of that in this episode.

36
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:33,921

00:08:26,334 --> 00:08:29,036
[SPEAKER_06]: Not joining us tonight is the lovely DarkSakura.

45
00:08:29,056 --> 00:08:30,016
[SPEAKER_06]: She has the night off.

46
00:08:30,976 --> 00:08:34,738
[SPEAKER_06]: But filling in instead is the one and only Xtifer.

47
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:35,659
[SPEAKER_06]: Yo, yo.

48
00:08:36,139 --> 00:08:39,341
[SPEAKER_06]: Who is promised to be at least PG-13 tonight?

49
00:08:40,341 --> 00:08:45,164
[SPEAKER_15]: I will only talk about, you know, the possible showing of boobs and ass.

50
00:08:45,384 --> 00:08:46,684
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, that's good.

51
00:08:47,025 --> 00:08:47,925
[SPEAKER_15]: Nothing else to promise.

52
00:08:48,085 --> 00:08:48,485
[SPEAKER_29]: Sounds good.

53
00:08:49,646 --> 00:08:52,527
[SPEAKER_29]: Also joining us, of course, the one and only Loki.

54
00:08:53,128 --> 00:08:53,628
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I'm here.

55
00:08:54,517 --> 00:08:54,977
[SPEAKER_06]: How you doing?

56
00:08:55,277 --> 00:08:55,478
[SPEAKER_06]: Good?

57
00:08:55,818 --> 00:08:55,978
[SPEAKER_06]: Good.

58
00:08:56,658 --> 00:08:56,959
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

59
00:08:57,319 --> 00:09:04,263
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, tonight, obviously, tonight's show is dedicated to the one and only Captain Jack, because he's the man.

60
00:09:04,823 --> 00:09:07,145
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll talk a little more about the captain when we come back.

61
00:09:07,485 --> 00:09:10,847
[SPEAKER_06]: But, of course, it's only appropriate that we play some Captain Jack songs tonight.

62
00:09:11,788 --> 00:09:17,231
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know how many we're going to play, but certainly through these first few breaks, we're going to pay some tribute to Captain Jack.

63
00:09:17,952 --> 00:09:19,813
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're going to start it off with one of my favorites.

64
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:20,433
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the one.

65
00:09:20,773 --> 00:09:21,614
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember this song.

66
00:09:22,998 --> 00:09:25,657
[SPEAKER_06]: From DDR4th Mix, and it's the song that...

67
00:09:26,718 --> 00:09:30,379
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody, at least in this area, the Sacramento people, used to really get down to.

68
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,280
[SPEAKER_06]: And, I mean, literally.

69
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,541
[SPEAKER_06]: And it had such a fun little dance to it.

70
00:09:36,122 --> 00:09:41,384
[SPEAKER_06]: And people would kind of, the lyrics kind of have you sing along with it and do a little dance.

71
00:09:41,724 --> 00:09:44,405
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was really cheesy and we all looked drunk and stupid.

72
00:09:44,825 --> 00:09:47,406
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know what, Captain Jack songs were all about fun.

73
00:09:47,626 --> 00:09:50,307
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is one of the most fun songs I can think of.

74
00:09:50,327 --> 00:09:52,248
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're going to start off this break with Only You.

75
00:09:52,728 --> 00:09:55,089
[SPEAKER_06]: And we'll be back with more Orange Lounge Radio after this.

76
00:09:57,809 --> 00:10:04,739
[SPEAKER_11]: This is radio station CJ Boogie with a brand new world premiere song from Captain Jack, Only You.

77
00:11:20,202 --> 00:11:21,123
Thanks for watching!

78
00:12:42,697 --> 00:12:46,780
[SPEAKER_11]: Only you can make me feel so true I'll never, never be so blue As long as I have you

79
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:41,730
[SPEAKER_09]: Celebrate Holiday Celebrate

80
00:16:30,825 --> 00:16:33,387
[SPEAKER_10]: The Step Squad to Orange Lab!

81
00:16:33,787 --> 00:16:35,669
[SPEAKER_10]: This PDR sucks!

82
00:16:35,749 --> 00:16:38,071
[SPEAKER_10]: Holla for the new level 7!

83
00:16:38,111 --> 00:16:38,371
[SPEAKER_09]: TTPO!

84
00:16:44,824 --> 00:16:45,505
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome back, kids.

85
00:16:45,725 --> 00:16:48,228
[SPEAKER_06]: We're here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 161.

86
00:16:48,308 --> 00:16:54,435
[SPEAKER_06]: In that break, we heard Only You by Captain Jack from DDR4thMix and Captain Jack with Holiday, the radio mix.

87
00:16:55,116 --> 00:16:59,581
[SPEAKER_06]: Tonight, of course, we played a couple of long versions there, which we don't usually do during our breaks.

88
00:16:59,761 --> 00:17:02,844
[SPEAKER_06]: But tonight, I think we have an excuse to be a little bit different.

89
00:17:03,005 --> 00:17:03,705
[SPEAKER_06]: So there you have it.

90
00:17:04,726 --> 00:17:19,660
[SPEAKER_06]: I promised our chat room, which by the way is swinging tonight over at www.orangeloungeradio.com clicking on chat, I promised them that we would have a major announcement regarding interactivity and the show a little bit before the program started and I'm going to reveal that right now.

91
00:17:21,089 --> 00:17:21,890
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's the big news.

92
00:17:23,411 --> 00:17:29,215
[SPEAKER_06]: As you know, we have the Skype line that allows you to contact us and we can talk to you on air.

93
00:17:30,256 --> 00:17:34,319
[SPEAKER_06]: But sometimes we have a lot of problems with the Skype line with people being able to talk to us.

94
00:17:34,759 --> 00:17:36,420
[SPEAKER_06]: They can't hear us or we can't hear them.

95
00:17:36,801 --> 00:17:39,963
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's the internet lag or something's going on, so it acts really funny.

96
00:17:41,084 --> 00:17:43,706
[SPEAKER_06]: So what we've done... Excuse me.

97
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:44,246
[SPEAKER_06]: Ah.

98
00:17:46,161 --> 00:17:48,383
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm burping here because I just had Sprite during the break.

99
00:17:48,863 --> 00:17:49,664
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't choke, Rob.

100
00:17:50,164 --> 00:17:52,326
[SPEAKER_06]: The worst is McDonald's french fries burped there.

101
00:17:52,346 --> 00:18:01,192
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, so what we did is we've actually purchased an add-on to Skype that will allow you to call us on a regular telephone and say hello to us.

102
00:18:01,632 --> 00:18:02,713
[SPEAKER_06]: So here's the thing, though.

103
00:18:02,913 --> 00:18:07,777
[SPEAKER_06]: Not only is it a regular phone so you can give us a call and talk to us, but it's also a message line.

104
00:18:08,297 --> 00:18:12,280
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you want to call and leave us a message at any time, you can, and we can play that on the show.

105
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:12,861
[SPEAKER_06]: So we thought...

106
00:18:13,806 --> 00:18:23,512
[SPEAKER_06]: With the news regarding Captain Jack, and I'm sure a lot of people have something they want to say, we thought we could open up this brand new thing and allow you guys to call in right now, leave some messages, and we'll play them later in the show.

107
00:18:23,952 --> 00:18:31,317
[SPEAKER_06]: But of course, now guys, try to keep it, you know, it is a three hour show, so we're kind of looking for, you know, what's your feedback on how

108
00:18:32,357 --> 00:18:32,958
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

109
00:18:51,129 --> 00:18:52,830
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for watching.

110
00:19:16,963 --> 00:19:18,866
[SPEAKER_06]: So you don't just have to have Skype to call in.

111
00:19:18,886 --> 00:19:24,392
[SPEAKER_06]: You can actually call us using a regular telephone as long as you're cool with paying long distance charges.

112
00:19:24,653 --> 00:19:26,876
[SPEAKER_06]: Or use a cell phone because you've got all those minutes.

113
00:19:27,396 --> 00:19:28,157
[SPEAKER_06]: Free long distance.

114
00:19:28,197 --> 00:19:28,578
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

115
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:33,524
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, so once again, the phone number, area code 916-226-9067.

116
00:19:38,397 --> 00:19:40,218
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm putting that in chat right now.

117
00:19:40,238 --> 00:19:42,178
[SPEAKER_06]: 916-226-9067.

118
00:19:43,259 --> 00:19:52,001
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, before we get into how was your week, how was your day, obviously the big pink elephant sitting in the room right now is Extifer.

119
00:19:52,181 --> 00:19:53,962
[SPEAKER_06]: No, is the fact that...

120
00:19:55,780 --> 00:20:00,823
[SPEAKER_06]: Captain Jack obviously passed away this week, which, you know, sucks.

121
00:20:02,404 --> 00:20:03,185
[SPEAKER_06]: How else do you say it?

122
00:20:03,245 --> 00:20:03,685
[SPEAKER_06]: It sucks.

123
00:20:04,406 --> 00:20:18,334
[SPEAKER_06]: He suffered a second stroke, apparently he had a stroke a couple years ago, and he had a second stroke, and when he suffered the second stroke, apparently he was at a party in full uniform, because I don't think a picture of Captain Jack exists where he was not in his full uniform, which is part of what made him so awesome.

124
00:20:19,443 --> 00:20:20,844
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

125
00:20:41,101 --> 00:20:43,763
[SPEAKER_06]: So anyway, I thought maybe we could go around before we do a little bit.

126
00:20:43,783 --> 00:20:44,184
[SPEAKER_06]: How was your week?

127
00:20:44,204 --> 00:20:44,784
[SPEAKER_06]: How was your day?

128
00:20:45,024 --> 00:20:47,226
[SPEAKER_06]: And what do you think about all that?

129
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,467
[SPEAKER_06]: What did you think of Captain Jack?

130
00:20:48,487 --> 00:20:50,169
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think about Captain Jack and DDR?

131
00:20:50,469 --> 00:20:51,490
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think about the music?

132
00:20:52,951 --> 00:20:54,012
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything you guys want to say?

133
00:20:54,392 --> 00:20:55,974
[SPEAKER_06]: And we'll start it off with Loki.

134
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:15,884
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, well, I was surprised to hear they'd passed away, um, because I remember the whole morning I was trying to see what his condition was, and a lot of people were, because they were getting sources from, like, a German site, so translating German, we weren't sure if it was, you know, still in coma, or passed away, or just like, you know.

135
00:21:16,264 --> 00:21:23,806
[SPEAKER_06]: So once he figured it out, you know, and the news hit everybody, um, you know, it was, you know, very surprising, that's for sure.

136
00:21:24,326 --> 00:21:25,226
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, the guy's

137
00:21:26,334 --> 00:21:53,506
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, I wasn't a particular fan of his music, I mean, he was in the category of songs that are quite annoying to be played over and over and over in DDR, so it wasn't bad, but it wasn't, you know, he wasn't as horrible as, say, like, you know, DJ Alligator or something like that, so it was still fun, his songs were fun, and he just, I mean, he's definitely stayed true to himself, I mean, he's just very, you know, out there, you know, not...

138
00:21:54,454 --> 00:21:55,135
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for watching!

139
00:22:18,283 --> 00:22:19,504
[SPEAKER_06]: Angel, anything you want to say about it?

140
00:22:19,524 --> 00:22:21,044
[SPEAKER_06]: Angel, anything you want to say about it?

141
00:22:48,584 --> 00:22:50,826
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm not quite sure on that, but I think so.

142
00:22:51,106 --> 00:22:57,691
[SPEAKER_26]: So, that's the first time that I ever played one of his songs, and, you know, I still like him, and, you know, good stuff.

143
00:22:58,612 --> 00:23:01,634
[SPEAKER_26]: And I'm sorry to hear that he did pass away this week.

144
00:23:02,134 --> 00:23:03,255
[SPEAKER_26]: That was kind of a shocker.

145
00:23:03,315 --> 00:23:11,601
[SPEAKER_26]: Actually, DJ Ranma S, one of our buddies, told me on AIM, we were, like, talking and stuff, and he was like, hey, did you hear him?

146
00:23:11,621 --> 00:23:12,062
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm like, what?

147
00:23:12,082 --> 00:23:12,942
[SPEAKER_26]: Huh?

148
00:23:13,262 --> 00:23:17,986
[SPEAKER_26]: So he, like, linked me to it, to the website that was announcing that he was in a coma and stuff, and

149
00:23:18,556 --> 00:23:19,277
[SPEAKER_26]: It's just sad.

150
00:23:20,538 --> 00:23:20,798
[SPEAKER_26]: Sad.

151
00:23:21,399 --> 00:23:21,639
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay.

152
00:23:22,239 --> 00:23:22,780
[SPEAKER_26]: I'll shut up now.

153
00:23:25,537 --> 00:23:39,426
[SPEAKER_06]: I kind of see Captain Jack as one of the three big artists in the beginnings of DDR, the other two being SmileDK and Erotic, because those three bands kind of showed up in every early mix and continue to show up in a lot of DDR mixes today.

154
00:23:40,667 --> 00:23:49,092
[SPEAKER_06]: And where SmileDK is kind of bubblegum pop girl stuff and Erotic is... I don't know what the hell you call Erotic.

155
00:23:49,613 --> 00:23:51,414
[SPEAKER_06]: Captain Jack is quite simply the shit.

156
00:23:51,954 --> 00:23:52,795
[SPEAKER_06]: Captain Jack is the shit.

157
00:23:52,995 --> 00:23:53,495
[SPEAKER_06]: He's the man.

158
00:23:55,797 --> 00:24:19,998
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, a little bit eccentric, yes, but that's cool, because his music was just a lot of dumb fun, and I know, and that's kind of what DDR is all about, DDR is kind of dumb fun, and so Captain Jack, you know, he just wants to be surrounded by hot bitches and dance, that's really what Captain Jack was all about, was hot bitches and dancing, and, you know, I think that's awesome, and

159
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:25,123
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just what DDR is all about, is having fun, and I think that's what Captain Jack's music was all about, is fun.

160
00:24:25,443 --> 00:24:26,504
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it ever going to win a Grammy?

161
00:24:26,584 --> 00:24:26,825
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

162
00:24:27,245 --> 00:24:31,328
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it, you know, the Oscar-winning soundtrack music?

163
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:31,728
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

164
00:24:31,949 --> 00:24:34,411
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it even critically acclaimed ever?

165
00:24:34,531 --> 00:24:34,731
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

166
00:24:34,831 --> 00:24:40,776
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just, it's fun, mindless, happy, bouncy music, and that's what DDR is all about.

167
00:24:41,596 --> 00:24:42,657
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's why Captain Jack's the man.

168
00:24:43,198 --> 00:24:50,984
[SPEAKER_26]: What made it ironic about the whole thing was last week when I, after the show, I decided to go out in the living room

169
00:24:51,912 --> 00:24:55,535
[SPEAKER_26]: and, uh, play, uh, EX2 for the first time.

170
00:24:56,556 --> 00:25:05,283
[SPEAKER_26]: And, uh, the song that's on there was one of the first ones I actually played, so hearing what happened, you know, earlier this week, I was like, what?

171
00:25:06,404 --> 00:25:12,469
[SPEAKER_26]: So, I don't know, it's just kind of, kind of, uh, well, yeah, like I said, ironic, so, I don't know.

172
00:25:13,249 --> 00:25:13,770
[SPEAKER_26]: It was just weird.

173
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:14,751
[SPEAKER_26]: It's like, wait.

174
00:25:14,771 --> 00:25:14,971
[SPEAKER_26]: Wait.

175
00:25:16,667 --> 00:25:20,829
[SPEAKER_06]: XFR, I would ask you, but I know you don't play enough DDR to probably even know who Captain Jack is.

176
00:25:20,849 --> 00:25:21,729
[SPEAKER_06]: The guy that died?

177
00:25:21,749 --> 00:25:22,950
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm guessing.

178
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:24,471
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, he is the guy that died this week.

179
00:25:24,511 --> 00:25:25,671
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, okay.

180
00:25:26,111 --> 00:25:26,992
[SPEAKER_15]: My condolences.

181
00:25:27,352 --> 00:25:28,312
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

182
00:25:29,153 --> 00:25:35,255
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's pretty interesting how the Bumani community and the music gaming community in general has kind of been responding.

183
00:25:35,596 --> 00:25:45,140
[SPEAKER_06]: I know the article that Loki posted on it, I don't know if it made the runarounds and blogs and stuff, but the story about Captain Jack's passing has had more hits than...

184
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,460
[SPEAKER_06]: and many more.

185
00:26:07,822 --> 00:26:10,104
[SPEAKER_06]: And another thing I could point out is, you know, you often wonder

186
00:26:35,883 --> 00:26:40,185
[SPEAKER_26]: If I ever pass away, will people find out about it and stuff like that?

187
00:26:40,465 --> 00:26:45,307
[SPEAKER_26]: I wonder if he wondered the same thing, because now look at the response after he passed away and stuff.

188
00:26:45,367 --> 00:26:47,788
[SPEAKER_26]: Kind of interesting.

189
00:26:47,848 --> 00:26:54,111
[SPEAKER_06]: I bet no record company here in this country had any idea how big of a following Captain Jack really had in this country.

190
00:26:54,971 --> 00:26:56,252
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of amazing.

191
00:26:59,073 --> 00:26:59,853
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what else to say.

192
00:26:59,953 --> 00:27:04,455
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to turn this into a three-hour sobfest, because honestly, that's not what Captain Jack was all about.

193
00:27:05,798 --> 00:27:08,480
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, he wants us to party, so let's like...

194
00:27:19,406 --> 00:27:20,807
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, hot female dogs.

195
00:27:20,967 --> 00:27:21,448
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, cool.

196
00:27:21,488 --> 00:27:21,888
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah.

197
00:27:23,229 --> 00:27:24,110
[SPEAKER_06]: Release the dogs.

198
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:25,531
[SPEAKER_26]: Release the hounds.

199
00:27:25,771 --> 00:27:37,341
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, again, if you want to call and leave a message on our message line, it's 916-226-9067 and we'll be playing some of your messages and your thoughts about Captain Jack a little later in the program.

200
00:27:40,063 --> 00:27:41,724
[SPEAKER_06]: What else did I want to say on the whole thing?

201
00:27:41,864 --> 00:27:52,190
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yes, of course, we had some requests if we could maybe play a little something and just kind of give Captain Jack an appropriate 21-gun salute.

202
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:59,053
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're going to give Captain Jack a 21-gun salute, or somebody suggested in the chat room, actually, a 21-arrow salute.

203
00:28:00,114 --> 00:28:01,354
[SPEAKER_06]: So however you want to...

204
00:28:02,819 --> 00:28:03,339
[SPEAKER_06]: Imagine it.

205
00:28:03,799 --> 00:28:08,321
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to give Captain Jack a moment of silence, an Orange Launch Radio moment of silence, and a 21-gun salute.

206
00:28:08,381 --> 00:28:11,883
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you would all please, a moment of silence and a salute.

207
00:28:47,202 --> 00:28:55,209
[SPEAKER_06]: and to that you know Captain Jack would have followed up with GO LEFT GO RIGHT GO RIGHT GO LEFT GO LEFT GO LEFT GO RIGHT GO LEFT

208
00:29:08,316 --> 00:29:11,238
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's get into Orange Lounge Radio and what we're all about.

209
00:29:11,378 --> 00:29:13,879
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello kids who are listening to us, maybe for the first time.

210
00:29:14,859 --> 00:29:21,782
[SPEAKER_06]: We're a radio program about the music games and video gaming in general, but sometimes we like to talk about ourselves.

211
00:29:21,822 --> 00:29:25,184
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of like imagine if you were going out to Denny's after the football game.

212
00:29:26,084 --> 00:29:28,585
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure, you talk about the football game a little bit, but you talk about other stuff too.

213
00:29:28,765 --> 00:29:31,286
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's what we're all about here at Orange Lounge, just sitting around having a good time.

214
00:29:31,727 --> 00:29:34,888
[SPEAKER_06]: So one way we just kind of do that is by talking about our weeks and our days.

215
00:29:35,368 --> 00:29:38,770
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're going to talk about your week and your day and what's been up and what's been going on.

216
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:42,912
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll start off tonight with DDR Angel, if you wouldn't mind starting us off with how was your week, how was your day?

217
00:29:43,272 --> 00:29:45,154
[SPEAKER_26]: Sure, that's not a problem.

218
00:29:45,414 --> 00:29:45,614
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah.

219
00:29:46,414 --> 00:29:48,996
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, the week was alright.

220
00:29:49,216 --> 00:29:55,159
[SPEAKER_26]: I spent Monday and Tuesday kind of trying to get my computer back online and stuff like that.

221
00:29:55,179 --> 00:30:02,803
[SPEAKER_26]: I finally got to that point at early Wednesday morning before class.

222
00:30:03,123 --> 00:30:03,844
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay.

223
00:30:04,518 --> 00:30:09,840
[SPEAKER_26]: and so that's all fine and good now and I can finally play all the games that I want to play.

224
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:19,323
[SPEAKER_26]: Today was pretty much spent catching up on World of Warcraft because I hadn't done it all week thanks to said computer.

225
00:30:20,604 --> 00:30:23,945
[SPEAKER_26]: Other than that I picked up EX2 this week.

226
00:30:23,965 --> 00:30:28,507
[SPEAKER_26]: I haven't gotten to play it yet but I shall get to that shortly.

227
00:30:30,583 --> 00:30:32,605
[SPEAKER_26]: Other than that, it's been a really quiet week.

228
00:30:33,186 --> 00:30:44,898
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, I picked up a, um, people are going to shoot me for this, but I ended up going to the bookstore and stumbling upon a Warcraft manga.

229
00:30:47,696 --> 00:30:48,197
[SPEAKER_06]: Nerd!

230
00:30:49,297 --> 00:30:49,798
[SPEAKER_26]: Nerd!

231
00:30:51,339 --> 00:30:53,480
[SPEAKER_06]: Fucking Warcraft manga, nerd!

232
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:54,580
[SPEAKER_26]: Hey!

233
00:30:55,921 --> 00:30:58,523
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't know, I saw it and I was like, okay, um, mine.

234
00:30:58,983 --> 00:31:01,164
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's see, let's see the story.

235
00:31:01,525 --> 00:31:04,907
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see, the World of Warcraft, no, this isn't World of Warcraft, this is Warcraft.

236
00:31:04,947 --> 00:31:06,207
[SPEAKER_26]: Actually it is, I think.

237
00:31:06,628 --> 00:31:09,830
[SPEAKER_06]: World of Warcraft, the Sunwell Trilogy.

238
00:31:10,959 --> 00:31:16,121
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an epic quest to save the world of Azeroth from the forces of the Undead Scourge.

239
00:31:16,821 --> 00:31:32,427
[SPEAKER_06]: Warcraft, the Sunworld Trilogy, chronicles the adventures of Kalec, a blue dragon who has taken human form to investigate a mysterious power, and Anveena, a beautiful young maiden with an enchanting secret.

240
00:31:35,442 --> 00:31:38,624
[SPEAKER_26]: and volume number two will be out in March of 2006.

241
00:31:39,064 --> 00:31:41,026
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's a sex novel then, huh?

242
00:31:41,186 --> 00:31:42,407
[SPEAKER_18]: No, it's not a sex novel.

243
00:31:42,507 --> 00:31:42,827
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, okay.

244
00:31:43,047 --> 00:31:43,427
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh dear.

245
00:31:44,508 --> 00:31:45,489
[SPEAKER_26]: What did I walk into?

246
00:31:45,509 --> 00:31:46,189
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh wait.

247
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:51,352
[SPEAKER_26]: Actually, yeah, so I bought that and he caught in a go.

248
00:31:52,679 --> 00:31:55,580
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, I bought all those too, but you probably don't know that.

249
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,940
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, go read Shonen Jump.

250
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:57,220
[SPEAKER_26]: Jeez.

251
00:31:59,641 --> 00:32:00,121
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay.

252
00:32:00,141 --> 00:32:02,541
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, well, it's in there.

253
00:32:02,601 --> 00:32:04,762
[SPEAKER_26]: Anyway, yeah, I bought manga this week.

254
00:32:04,902 --> 00:32:05,362
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, anyway.

255
00:32:05,382 --> 00:32:05,862
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all good.

256
00:32:05,962 --> 00:32:06,402
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all good.

257
00:32:07,062 --> 00:32:08,062
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever you're into.

258
00:32:08,302 --> 00:32:08,562
[SPEAKER_26]: What?

259
00:32:08,682 --> 00:32:15,444
[SPEAKER_26]: My Japanese side cries for books and stuff.

260
00:32:15,644 --> 00:32:15,924
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay.

261
00:32:17,324 --> 00:32:18,345
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't know.

262
00:32:18,785 --> 00:32:19,505
[SPEAKER_26]: I guess that's it.

263
00:32:20,445 --> 00:32:20,866
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

264
00:32:21,666 --> 00:32:22,587
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, how was your week?

265
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:23,088
[SPEAKER_06]: How was your day?

266
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:27,252
[SPEAKER_06]: My week was okay.

267
00:32:28,433 --> 00:32:33,978
[SPEAKER_06]: I played other games and worked on websites.

268
00:32:36,581 --> 00:32:37,361
[SPEAKER_06]: That's about it.

269
00:32:38,262 --> 00:32:39,343
[SPEAKER_06]: Ate steak today.

270
00:32:41,425 --> 00:32:41,806
[SPEAKER_06]: Steak.

271
00:32:42,046 --> 00:32:42,646
[SPEAKER_06]: What kind of steak?

272
00:32:45,629 --> 00:32:47,010
[SPEAKER_06]: How do you enjoy your slabs of meat?

273
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:48,231
[SPEAKER_06]: Medium or medium rare.

274
00:32:48,311 --> 00:32:48,531
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

275
00:32:48,871 --> 00:32:49,091
[SPEAKER_06]: Me too.

276
00:32:49,151 --> 00:32:49,632
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways, so no, that

277
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,941
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty much all I did was play the Warriors this week.

278
00:33:12,761 --> 00:33:13,741
[SPEAKER_06]: And I love that game.

279
00:33:14,021 --> 00:33:17,742
[SPEAKER_06]: There's nothing more fun than a game that starts off with beating up bums.

280
00:33:19,323 --> 00:33:21,043
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, hitting them with bricks and stuff.

281
00:33:21,083 --> 00:33:25,044
[SPEAKER_06]: And then they mug somebody by throwing a TV at their head and knocking them down and then stole their money.

282
00:33:25,645 --> 00:33:27,825
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just, that's great gameplay right there.

283
00:33:29,406 --> 00:33:30,046
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yep.

284
00:33:30,566 --> 00:33:31,146
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what happened.

285
00:33:32,166 --> 00:33:34,987
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, okay.

286
00:33:35,007 --> 00:33:36,008
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, well I guess that's it then.

287
00:33:36,128 --> 00:33:37,008
[SPEAKER_06]: Extrover, how was your week?

288
00:33:37,028 --> 00:33:37,408
[SPEAKER_06]: How was your day?

289
00:33:38,935 --> 00:33:39,816
[SPEAKER_06]: It was good.

290
00:33:40,436 --> 00:33:47,482
[SPEAKER_15]: I played a lot of World of Warcraft and I played some Final Fantasy XI.

291
00:33:50,965 --> 00:33:55,569
[SPEAKER_15]: My sister came over yesterday and hung out with me and you, Sky.

292
00:33:56,870 --> 00:34:03,095
[SPEAKER_15]: And we all hung out and stuff and ate at Claim Jumper, which is a popular restaurant over here.

293
00:34:04,896 --> 00:34:12,582
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, and today I kind of have, well, actually, you know, this week I've also been preparing for tomorrow's show.

294
00:34:14,823 --> 00:34:15,424
[SPEAKER_15]: Listen to it.

295
00:34:15,884 --> 00:34:16,444
[SPEAKER_15]: Starts tomorrow.

296
00:34:17,245 --> 00:34:17,805
[SPEAKER_15]: What's it called?

297
00:34:17,825 --> 00:34:18,446
[SPEAKER_15]: What time's it on?

298
00:34:18,486 --> 00:34:20,367
[SPEAKER_15]: Christopher's Case of the Monday starts at 7.

299
00:34:22,289 --> 00:34:23,549
[SPEAKER_15]: And, um... PST.

300
00:34:24,290 --> 00:34:25,091
[SPEAKER_15]: PST.

301
00:34:25,211 --> 00:34:27,873
[SPEAKER_15]: Meaning Pacific Standard Time, not Please Send Tell.

302
00:34:27,933 --> 00:34:29,053
[SPEAKER_15]: I know what it means.

303
00:34:30,434 --> 00:34:34,878
[SPEAKER_15]: So, you know, listen and stuff.

304
00:34:35,158 --> 00:34:37,239
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm planning on it lasting for two hours.

305
00:34:37,379 --> 00:34:38,060
[SPEAKER_15]: Who knows, though?

306
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,941
[SPEAKER_15]: It may last less than that.

307
00:34:41,362 --> 00:34:44,044
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just planning on it being kind of like a fun, random show.

308
00:34:44,384 --> 00:34:45,085
[SPEAKER_15]: Start off your week.

309
00:34:46,126 --> 00:34:47,847
[SPEAKER_15]: And I love my intro song.

310
00:34:48,868 --> 00:34:49,508
[SPEAKER_15]: Love it, love it.

311
00:34:49,548 --> 00:34:50,589
[SPEAKER_15]: I can't stop talking about it.

312
00:34:50,609 --> 00:34:51,930
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm almost obsessed with it.

313
00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:54,031
[SPEAKER_06]: So are you going to be sad if no one listens?

314
00:34:56,373 --> 00:34:57,534
[SPEAKER_06]: No, yes.

315
00:34:57,974 --> 00:34:58,595
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, possibly.

316
00:34:59,295 --> 00:35:02,578
[SPEAKER_06]: I figure either way, no matter what, it's got to have higher ratings than Diversion did.

317
00:35:02,798 --> 00:35:09,063
[SPEAKER_15]: So... Well, just listen, give it a chance, be objective.

318
00:35:09,463 --> 00:35:10,544
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not going to be all sex.

319
00:35:11,565 --> 00:35:12,586
[SPEAKER_15]: It'll be more than that.

320
00:35:13,726 --> 00:35:21,292
[SPEAKER_15]: Although I'd enjoy if you'd just take off your pants when you listen to it.

321
00:35:21,353 --> 00:35:23,034
[SPEAKER_06]: Your mic is going on and off.

322
00:35:23,754 --> 00:35:24,635
[SPEAKER_06]: That cord sucks.

323
00:35:24,675 --> 00:35:25,596
[SPEAKER_06]: We have to get it replaced, so...

324
00:35:26,331 --> 00:35:27,232
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, well.

325
00:35:27,272 --> 00:35:27,613
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you there?

326
00:35:28,434 --> 00:35:28,814
[SPEAKER_15]: I think I am.

327
00:35:28,834 --> 00:35:29,435
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I can hear you.

328
00:35:29,515 --> 00:35:29,835
[SPEAKER_06]: Barely.

329
00:35:31,157 --> 00:35:32,578
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, use Loki's mic for now.

330
00:35:33,019 --> 00:35:33,419
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

331
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:34,901
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a little clearer anyway.

332
00:35:36,182 --> 00:35:38,025
[SPEAKER_15]: So anyways, that's how my week and my day was.

333
00:35:38,926 --> 00:35:39,106
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

334
00:35:40,633 --> 00:35:41,334
[SPEAKER_06]: My week and my day.

335
00:35:41,394 --> 00:35:45,217
[SPEAKER_06]: I went to a party last night and I got slightly intoxicated.

336
00:35:46,998 --> 00:35:47,379
[SPEAKER_06]: Slightly.

337
00:35:48,059 --> 00:35:48,640
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm okay.

338
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:51,142
[SPEAKER_06]: And remember kids, don't drink and drive.

339
00:35:51,362 --> 00:35:51,642
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't.

340
00:35:53,644 --> 00:35:58,147
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've been playing a lot of World of Warcraft myself this week, which I know makes me a huge-ass hypocrite.

341
00:35:59,548 --> 00:35:59,828
[SPEAKER_06]: But no.

342
00:36:00,949 --> 00:36:02,310
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't go by books, okay?

343
00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:03,290
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't go by the manga.

344
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:04,850
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just kidding, I'm kidding.

345
00:36:05,171 --> 00:36:05,491
[SPEAKER_06]: It's cool.

346
00:36:06,631 --> 00:36:11,673
[SPEAKER_06]: But I've just been trying to get into it and seeing how I like it compared to the other MMOs out there.

347
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:16,574
[SPEAKER_06]: And other than that, I haven't been doing a whole lot of things of interest.

348
00:36:17,775 --> 00:36:22,556
[SPEAKER_06]: I did watch the season premieres of South Park and Drawn Together, though, which were excellent.

349
00:36:23,657 --> 00:36:24,597
[SPEAKER_26]: We should have listened!

350
00:36:25,694 --> 00:36:26,636
[SPEAKER_26]: We should have listened!

351
00:36:27,298 --> 00:36:29,483
[SPEAKER_26]: Go around the ends and say trick or treat.

352
00:36:29,784 --> 00:36:31,147
[SPEAKER_26]: And you, like, get turned into stuff.

353
00:36:31,528 --> 00:36:32,691
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, I got turned into a ninja today.

354
00:36:32,872 --> 00:36:33,914
[SPEAKER_26]: I got turned into a bat.

355
00:36:33,974 --> 00:36:35,037
[SPEAKER_26]: That was kind of interesting.

356
00:36:35,717 --> 00:36:37,157
[SPEAKER_15]: I got turned into a skeleton.

357
00:36:37,518 --> 00:36:42,939
[SPEAKER_15]: Although I really think that the Halloween stuff in World of Warcraft is way better than Final Fantasy XI.

358
00:36:43,439 --> 00:36:45,740
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, I can't stand the Final Fantasy XI thing.

359
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:46,960
[SPEAKER_15]: It just sucked.

360
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:51,882
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to talk about this on the podcast a little later, but I don't want to compare Final Fantasy XI to World of Warcraft.

361
00:36:51,902 --> 00:36:52,722
[SPEAKER_06]: But you know what?

362
00:36:52,782 --> 00:36:55,443
[SPEAKER_15]: I can compare those two because they're both having Halloween events.

363
00:36:56,163 --> 00:36:56,723
[SPEAKER_15]: So, you know...

364
00:37:00,014 --> 00:37:01,695
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, that's fine.

365
00:37:02,455 --> 00:37:03,876
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, let's see.

366
00:37:03,916 --> 00:37:09,820
[SPEAKER_06]: I think what we'll do now is we're going to take a little bit of break, then we're going to come back and we're going to talk about some Bomani news, some things going on in the Bomani world.

367
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:13,662
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's see, what do we want to do this break?

368
00:37:14,182 --> 00:37:20,265
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we'll do another Captain Jack song, although I think we'll keep it to shorter versions this time.

369
00:37:21,106 --> 00:37:24,908
[SPEAKER_06]: And we'll be back after this break with more Orange Lodge Radio.

370
00:37:24,948 --> 00:37:26,289
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't forget, you can call our message line.

371
00:37:26,309 --> 00:37:26,629
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to

372
00:37:27,009 --> 00:37:29,930
[SPEAKER_06]: Get into the message line in probably about another 30 minutes or so.

373
00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:32,472
[SPEAKER_06]: So make sure you get all your messages in about Captain Jack.

374
00:37:33,392 --> 00:37:37,834
[SPEAKER_06]: Area code 916-226-9067.

375
00:37:37,874 --> 00:37:40,135
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember, it's a three-hour show, so keep your messages short.

376
00:37:40,455 --> 00:37:42,536
[SPEAKER_06]: We can't guarantee we'll get to all the messages as well.

377
00:37:43,276 --> 00:37:44,597
[SPEAKER_06]: So just give it a call.

378
00:37:45,437 --> 00:37:48,659
[SPEAKER_06]: And we'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.

379
00:37:51,152 --> 00:37:51,732
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you ready?

380
00:37:51,752 --> 00:37:53,513
[SPEAKER_09]: Ready for the race?

381
00:37:53,653 --> 00:37:54,293
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you ready?

382
00:37:54,513 --> 00:37:55,894
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you ready?

383
00:37:56,594 --> 00:37:57,214
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you ready?

384
00:39:23,391 --> 00:39:24,374
[SPEAKER_10]: My Generation

385
00:39:38,809 --> 00:39:53,838
DJ Ranma S, Solid is my foundation, I get the information, how to fix a situation Play me, radio stations, with no complications, I am an inspiration, to the whole generation Party throw your hands up, party throw your hands up, party throw your hands up, get em up, ha Party throw your hands up, party throw your hands up

387
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:48,452
My Generation

388
00:42:06,005 --> 00:42:06,585
Thanks for watching!

389
00:42:33,929 --> 00:42:35,999
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go

390
00:43:57,380 --> 00:43:59,702
[SPEAKER_09]: Go left, go right, go left, go left, go right, go left

391
00:44:17,179 --> 00:44:19,561
[SPEAKER_06]: We're back here on Orange Lounge Radio on this episode number 161.

392
00:44:20,042 --> 00:44:24,986
[SPEAKER_06]: A whole break there of Captain Jack songs from DDR because, of course, Captain Jack passed this past week.

393
00:44:25,707 --> 00:44:27,608
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're just kind of doing some tributes tonight.

394
00:44:27,728 --> 00:44:29,890
[SPEAKER_06]: Some songs there that you heard in that break, The Race.

395
00:44:30,011 --> 00:44:33,153
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a song that was in not only DDR third mix, but also a Beatmania song.

396
00:44:33,694 --> 00:44:34,535
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of a fun song there.

397
00:44:34,855 --> 00:44:41,401
[SPEAKER_06]: My Generation, which I believe was the first Captain Jack song to be in American DDR, I think.

398
00:44:42,301 --> 00:44:44,623
[SPEAKER_06]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

399
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:14,762
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, of course, Captain Jack, which is kind of the song that everybody knows.

400
00:45:15,242 --> 00:45:17,043
[SPEAKER_06]: The actual song, Captain Jack, from 3rd Mix.

401
00:45:18,184 --> 00:45:19,265
[SPEAKER_06]: The song that has the F word in it.

402
00:45:19,726 --> 00:45:20,706
[SPEAKER_06]: I will be your fucking man.

403
00:45:21,207 --> 00:45:21,887
[SPEAKER_06]: At one point in there.

404
00:45:22,268 --> 00:45:22,608
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

405
00:45:22,628 --> 00:45:23,028
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

406
00:45:23,349 --> 00:45:24,209
[SPEAKER_06]: Lays down the smack there.

407
00:45:24,289 --> 00:45:25,310
[SPEAKER_06]: I will be your fucking man.

408
00:45:27,717 --> 00:45:29,018
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

409
00:45:50,033 --> 00:45:51,194
[SPEAKER_06]: and here's the catch.

410
00:45:51,854 --> 00:45:55,537
[SPEAKER_06]: Not only is it a copy of DDR Extreme 2, it's a bundle, kids.

411
00:45:55,637 --> 00:46:00,881
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a bundle pack, which means it has an official Konami soft pad bundled in with it.

412
00:46:00,941 --> 00:46:03,062
[SPEAKER_06]: And those things are not easy to get.

413
00:46:03,503 --> 00:46:06,425
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you want the best soft pad you can get,

414
00:46:07,065 --> 00:46:08,747
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to give you a chance to win it next week.

415
00:46:09,007 --> 00:46:10,649
[SPEAKER_06]: And a copy of DDR Extreme 2 as well.

416
00:46:10,989 --> 00:46:12,831
[SPEAKER_06]: And more details to come next week.

417
00:46:13,171 --> 00:46:14,233
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what we're going to do.

418
00:46:14,353 --> 00:46:15,894
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll have to think about that.

419
00:46:15,934 --> 00:46:18,277
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to boo about that over this next week.

420
00:46:18,377 --> 00:46:19,398
[SPEAKER_06]: So it'll be exciting.

421
00:46:19,418 --> 00:46:20,099
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're going to give that away.

422
00:46:23,129 --> 00:46:27,172
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, one more thing I want to point out is our message line.

423
00:46:27,212 --> 00:46:28,513
[SPEAKER_06]: We are taking messages right now.

424
00:46:28,573 --> 00:46:33,316
[SPEAKER_06]: If you have something you want to say about Captain Jack, area code 916-226-9067.

425
00:46:33,356 --> 00:46:36,639
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the brand new Orange Lounge Radio message line.

426
00:46:37,782 --> 00:46:38,983
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for watching!

427
00:46:55,370 --> 00:46:55,910
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

428
00:47:16,016 --> 00:47:16,696
[SPEAKER_06]: A podcast.

429
00:47:16,756 --> 00:47:20,137
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the new MIDI Head MP3 where he's teasing Ultramix 3.

430
00:47:20,457 --> 00:47:23,438
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm going to be downright honest, I haven't had time to listen to it yet.

431
00:47:23,938 --> 00:47:24,898
[SPEAKER_06]: I listened to part of it.

432
00:47:24,918 --> 00:47:25,178
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you?

433
00:47:25,218 --> 00:47:25,959
[SPEAKER_06]: What did you think?

434
00:47:25,999 --> 00:47:27,399
[SPEAKER_06]: What came up?

435
00:47:27,559 --> 00:47:30,440
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just as cool as most MIDI Head stuff.

436
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:33,520
[SPEAKER_06]: Played some more tracks from his new album.

437
00:47:34,361 --> 00:47:34,521
[SPEAKER_06]: And...

438
00:47:36,161 --> 00:47:36,982
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just, it was good.

439
00:47:37,243 --> 00:47:42,128
[SPEAKER_06]: And he gave, he let us know what some of the artists are going to be on Ultramix 3.

440
00:47:42,229 --> 00:47:44,031
[SPEAKER_06]: Looks like quite a lineup, too.

441
00:47:44,251 --> 00:47:46,574
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's got a very interesting lineup in Ultramix 3.

442
00:47:46,954 --> 00:47:47,955
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see, I gotta head on over here to...

443
00:47:50,382 --> 00:47:58,489
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the websites here, because honestly, I've been a little bit disconnected from everything this week, so... I haven't really been reading what's going on.

444
00:47:58,809 --> 00:48:07,256
[SPEAKER_06]: I did hear, I heard some people bitching in the chatroom about Good Charlotte being in Ultramix 3, so I guess that news came out, that Good Charlotte's going to be in there.

445
00:48:07,276 --> 00:48:12,701
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I know, that's kind of an interesting addition, to say the least.

446
00:48:14,202 --> 00:48:14,322
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

447
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:16,664
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, They Might Be Giants.

448
00:48:16,684 --> 00:48:27,211
[SPEAKER_06]: I think some folks in the thread there used screen captures from a screenshot that was released on the internet to figure out that the They Might Be Giants song we were supposed to be getting is Istanbul, not Constantinople.

449
00:48:27,492 --> 00:48:30,294
[SPEAKER_06]: Which actually makes me sad because I wanted the Tiny Toons video in it.

450
00:48:30,734 --> 00:48:33,396
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that would have been awesome if it was the Tiny Toons music video.

451
00:48:34,289 --> 00:48:34,929
[SPEAKER_06]: Moby

452
00:49:04,218 --> 00:49:04,999
[SPEAKER_06]: Black Eyed Peas

453
00:49:17,779 --> 00:49:19,600
[SPEAKER_06]: B-52s, that's pretty awesome.

454
00:49:19,620 --> 00:49:20,881
[SPEAKER_06]: The B-52s are awesome.

455
00:49:21,601 --> 00:49:24,602
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know which song it's going to be, but I'm... I hope they do Rome.

456
00:49:25,283 --> 00:49:28,184
[SPEAKER_06]: I liked Rome, but I'm kind of hoping for Rock Lobster a little bit.

457
00:49:28,584 --> 00:49:29,345
[SPEAKER_06]: Rock Lobster!

458
00:49:29,765 --> 00:49:32,146
[SPEAKER_15]: They always do Love Shack Rock Lobster.

459
00:49:32,646 --> 00:49:35,248
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll probably be Love Shack, but, you know.

460
00:49:36,288 --> 00:49:36,808
[SPEAKER_06]: What else is there?

461
00:49:36,828 --> 00:49:38,029
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see, we've got Basement Jacks.

462
00:49:38,369 --> 00:49:38,950
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty cool.

463
00:49:39,270 --> 00:49:39,850
[SPEAKER_06]: Basement Jacks.

464
00:49:40,950 --> 00:49:41,651
[SPEAKER_06]: No FX.

465
00:49:43,001 --> 00:49:44,563
[SPEAKER_06]: Blackalicious, Groove Armada, and Devo

466
00:50:00,748 --> 00:50:03,029
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like Myspace in the form of DDR.

467
00:50:26,952 --> 00:50:27,813
[SPEAKER_06]: It totally is.

468
00:50:28,293 --> 00:50:28,954
[SPEAKER_06]: It totally is.

469
00:50:29,014 --> 00:50:31,156
[SPEAKER_06]: Ultramix 3 is DDR Myspace mix.

470
00:50:33,318 --> 00:50:33,959
[SPEAKER_06]: That's great.

471
00:50:39,624 --> 00:50:46,070
[SPEAKER_06]: I wonder if next year when they do Ultramix 4, if they're going to go up to the 360 or if they're going to stay on the regular Xbox platform.

472
00:50:46,090 --> 00:50:46,831
[SPEAKER_06]: What's going to happen?

473
00:50:47,171 --> 00:50:47,832
[SPEAKER_06]: Should be interesting.

474
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:51,605
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, we already know a bunch of other songs that are going to be in Ultra Mix 3 this year.

475
00:50:52,406 --> 00:50:58,236
[SPEAKER_06]: We have songs such as Spray doing I Am Gothic.

476
00:50:58,677 --> 00:51:00,480
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's kind of another borderline emo song.

477
00:51:03,171 --> 00:51:05,033
[SPEAKER_15]: They should have done the Kill With My Car song.

478
00:51:06,254 --> 00:51:20,985
[SPEAKER_06]: Raise Your Hands by Midihead, of course, Conflict by The Azoic, Basile by Orif Is, Drivin', Naoki featuring Politary, and Brilliant R.E.D., which is a brand new Naoki song, which one of the screenshots gave away that was posted by another website.

479
00:51:21,966 --> 00:51:26,350
[SPEAKER_06]: Love This Feelin', the Zonk remix by Akiriyama Oka, but remixed by Zonk.

480
00:51:26,810 --> 00:51:33,614
[SPEAKER_06]: JellyKiss, MidiHead, SmackMix HashTheSun, Shatonix Remix of Colors, MidiHead Remix of Bylalaki I Carried With The Wind Come With Me, Raindancer

481
00:51:51,724 --> 00:51:54,828
[SPEAKER_06]: and Together and Forever by Captain Jack, which I think is pretty cool.

482
00:51:54,888 --> 00:51:59,173
[SPEAKER_06]: So we do get a Captain Jack song in Ultramix 3, pretty appropriate at this point.

483
00:51:59,893 --> 00:52:01,776
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's what's going on with Ultramix 3.

484
00:52:06,793 --> 00:52:07,813
[SPEAKER_06]: should be an interesting mix.

485
00:52:08,434 --> 00:52:16,220
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, I think what we'll do now, why don't we go ahead and let's go over to the Orange Launch Radio message line and let's see what we got on our messages.

486
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:19,422
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we'll actually open up the Skype line in a little bit to take calls.

487
00:52:19,742 --> 00:52:28,349
[SPEAKER_06]: And when we open up the Skype line to take live calls, you can either call us over the Skype line like you always do in the past, or you can just get on the phone and punch in the digits.

488
00:52:28,709 --> 00:52:31,131
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're going to load up and see what messages we got on the Skype line.

489
00:52:31,351 --> 00:52:32,652
[SPEAKER_06]: We wanted to see what people had to say about...

490
00:52:35,273 --> 00:52:40,977
[SPEAKER_06]: and of course this is a brand new thing kind of for us is this whole thing so this is very experimental so I'm not sure

491
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:43,060
[SPEAKER_06]: He's your webmaster.

492
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:43,681
[SPEAKER_06]: I like it.

493
00:53:12,276 --> 00:53:13,617
[SPEAKER_06]: Whoops, I think that was a test call.

494
00:53:15,258 --> 00:53:17,219
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's try this one instead.

495
00:53:18,899 --> 00:53:19,600
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, what's up?

496
00:53:19,660 --> 00:53:20,240
[SPEAKER_20]: It's the same.

497
00:53:20,860 --> 00:53:25,403
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, I don't know, this whole thing about Captain Jack is pretty crappy.

498
00:53:26,303 --> 00:53:27,724
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, I love the songs.

499
00:53:28,144 --> 00:53:31,046
[SPEAKER_20]: Good times at Third Mix playing Captain Jack on the standard.

500
00:53:31,906 --> 00:53:37,989
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, those were good times, but you know, it's terrible a guy like that has to mess away, so I don't know.

501
00:53:39,570 --> 00:53:41,271
[SPEAKER_20]: It just sucks, but

502
00:53:42,202 --> 00:53:43,884
[SPEAKER_20]: Captain Jack lives on in our hearts.

503
00:53:45,605 --> 00:53:51,712
[SPEAKER_20]: And did you also know Captain Jack, I was looking at pictures, he's a freaking pimp.

504
00:53:52,612 --> 00:53:54,474
[SPEAKER_20]: Captain Jack is the master pimp.

505
00:53:54,494 --> 00:53:57,938
[SPEAKER_20]: He had so many ladies, it was just awesome.

506
00:53:58,839 --> 00:54:02,602
[SPEAKER_20]: But, sucks about Captain Jack.

507
00:54:08,424 --> 00:54:11,205
[SPEAKER_06]: Captain Jack was all about the hot bitches, honestly.

508
00:54:12,266 --> 00:54:20,890
[SPEAKER_06]: You see these pictures, I mean, if you go to his official website, which I think is like CaptainJack.de or something like that, you go to his website, and in like half his picture galleries, he is surrounded by hot-ass bitches.

509
00:54:21,350 --> 00:54:24,672
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, what a fun guy.

510
00:54:25,092 --> 00:54:25,952
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go to another message.

511
00:54:26,012 --> 00:54:27,253
[SPEAKER_06]: He was a pimp, but in a good way.

512
00:54:28,534 --> 00:54:31,315
[SPEAKER_19]: Hey, just sitting here in my room, Nintendo Maniac 64.

513
00:54:31,755 --> 00:54:36,157
[SPEAKER_19]: Just testing out this new golf thingy.

514
00:54:37,238 --> 00:54:37,678
[SPEAKER_19]: Can't answer...

515
00:54:38,655 --> 00:54:40,335
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm in the living room, I'm just back in my room.

516
00:54:40,355 --> 00:54:43,236
[SPEAKER_19]: Supposed to be doing homework, but... You know what?

517
00:54:43,256 --> 00:54:44,416
[SPEAKER_19]: Screw you, homework!

518
00:54:44,656 --> 00:54:45,536
[SPEAKER_19]: Screw you!

519
00:54:46,216 --> 00:54:46,556
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

520
00:54:47,216 --> 00:54:48,457
[SPEAKER_19]: It really grinds like yours.

521
00:54:49,917 --> 00:54:51,737
[SPEAKER_19]: Like America does to Peter Griffin.

522
00:54:53,898 --> 00:54:56,538
[SPEAKER_19]: So... I think I'm getting Doritos and stuff.

523
00:54:56,798 --> 00:54:57,418
[SPEAKER_19]: Doritos are good.

524
00:54:57,618 --> 00:54:58,418
[SPEAKER_19]: Especially the ranch flavor.

525
00:54:58,438 --> 00:55:01,859
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm just watching movies that... Are you high?!

526
00:55:03,459 --> 00:55:04,219
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this guy high?!

527
00:55:04,239 --> 00:55:05,400
[SPEAKER_19]: No, I don't think so.

528
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:07,980
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, I'm just, like, jabbering.

529
00:55:09,824 --> 00:55:12,727
[SPEAKER_19]: So yeah, Loki, I know what you did with my foot last night.

530
00:55:12,987 --> 00:55:15,649
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know what the heck was going on in that sick mind of yours.

531
00:55:16,890 --> 00:55:23,516
[SPEAKER_19]: And go to gamersadvance.com because they have openings for, like, reviewer people and stuff.

532
00:55:24,017 --> 00:55:31,083
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, gamersadvance.com with a D at the end of advance.

533
00:55:31,523 --> 00:55:31,783
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay?

534
00:55:33,125 --> 00:55:33,965
[SPEAKER_19]: Spits.com.

535
00:55:34,166 --> 00:55:34,846
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, Spits.com.

536
00:55:35,987 --> 00:55:36,708
[SPEAKER_19]: I come out into the...

537
00:55:37,435 --> 00:55:38,416
[SPEAKER_19]: I think he was high.

538
00:55:38,516 --> 00:55:39,517
[SPEAKER_19]: He was something.

539
00:55:39,537 --> 00:55:42,579
[SPEAKER_19]: He was so high he forgot to mention Captain Jack.

540
00:55:42,599 --> 00:55:43,099
[SPEAKER_19]: No, it's fine.

541
00:55:43,180 --> 00:55:43,920
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm just teasing.

542
00:56:03,234 --> 00:56:04,395
[SPEAKER_15]: I do agree with the Doritos.

543
00:56:04,415 --> 00:56:05,676
[SPEAKER_06]: Doritos are the shit though.

544
00:56:05,716 --> 00:56:06,457
[SPEAKER_06]: Doritos are awesome.

545
00:56:06,477 --> 00:56:07,858
[SPEAKER_15]: Ranch Doritos are good, but you know what?

546
00:56:08,339 --> 00:56:09,399
[SPEAKER_15]: Nothing beats the original.

547
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:11,021
[SPEAKER_15]: They're the cheesy.

548
00:56:11,341 --> 00:56:12,942
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, the cheesiest is Cheetos, right?

549
00:56:13,663 --> 00:56:14,103
[SPEAKER_06]: I think so.

550
00:56:14,684 --> 00:56:17,226
[SPEAKER_15]: They're the cheesiest to me in my book.

551
00:56:17,806 --> 00:56:19,507
[SPEAKER_06]: Our listeners are kind of sedated tonight.

552
00:56:19,547 --> 00:56:20,448
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what's going on.

553
00:56:20,648 --> 00:56:21,469
[SPEAKER_06]: No, what's going on?

554
00:56:21,549 --> 00:56:21,909
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

555
00:56:21,929 --> 00:56:24,812
[SPEAKER_15]: Did you guys put on a fire or something?

556
00:56:25,232 --> 00:56:27,774
[SPEAKER_15]: Shut all the windows or something?

557
00:56:29,275 --> 00:56:30,156
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go to another message.

558
00:56:31,667 --> 00:56:33,308
[SPEAKER_16]: Greetings, Orange Lounge Radio.

559
00:56:33,368 --> 00:56:36,830
[SPEAKER_16]: This is El Mullet with my thoughts on the passing of Captain Jack.

560
00:56:38,171 --> 00:56:39,812
[SPEAKER_16]: I really like Captain Jack's music.

561
00:56:39,872 --> 00:56:46,916
[SPEAKER_16]: I've played it ever since the second remix home version when two of his songs were used as preview tracks.

562
00:56:47,936 --> 00:56:49,998
[SPEAKER_16]: And I remember Captain Jack fondly.

563
00:56:50,838 --> 00:56:52,439
[SPEAKER_16]: He had some of my favorite songs.

564
00:56:52,919 --> 00:57:00,964
[SPEAKER_16]: And I remember him especially fondly because Captain Jack's Grand Ballet mix was the first catastrophic level song that I have ever passed.

565
00:57:01,601 --> 00:57:06,924
[SPEAKER_16]: which is really odd considering his step chart is incredibly difficult to begin with.

566
00:57:07,444 --> 00:57:09,485
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, it is.

567
00:57:09,766 --> 00:57:15,789
[SPEAKER_16]: And also, Dream of Dream was the first heavy song at seven stars that I ever AAA'd.

568
00:57:16,950 --> 00:57:22,953
[SPEAKER_16]: In any case, Captain Jack was very fun not only to listen to but to look at through his music videos.

569
00:57:23,573 --> 00:57:26,555
[SPEAKER_16]: If you wanted to know where all the white women were at, there they were.

570
00:57:27,896 --> 00:57:29,777
[SPEAKER_16]: And in any case, I will remember him

571
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:37,404
[SPEAKER_16]: with the greatest of memories, as it were, for lack of better words, and embarrassing myself on your new message line.

572
00:57:38,885 --> 00:57:40,025
[SPEAKER_15]: It's okay, everybody else is.

573
00:57:40,385 --> 00:57:48,310
[SPEAKER_16]: I shall be playing his songs in remembrance, and thank you for allowing me this forum to talk about Captain Jack.

574
00:57:48,810 --> 00:57:50,531
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you very much, everyone, and goodbye.

575
00:57:50,551 --> 00:57:54,693
[SPEAKER_06]: Where are the white women going to hang out now?

576
00:57:55,214 --> 00:57:57,615
[SPEAKER_06]: Now that Captain Jack's gone, where are all the white women going to go?

577
00:57:58,468 --> 00:58:00,249
[SPEAKER_15]: They'll go hang out with another gangsta.

578
00:58:00,609 --> 00:58:02,089
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, I don't know.

579
00:58:02,209 --> 00:58:02,809
[SPEAKER_15]: In Germany.

580
00:58:04,890 --> 00:58:05,770
[SPEAKER_06]: Good message, I like that.

581
00:58:06,871 --> 00:58:07,691
[SPEAKER_15]: Wasn't he from Germany?

582
00:58:08,551 --> 00:58:13,533
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I don't think he was from Germany, but he was big in Germany, like Hasselhoff was big in Germany.

583
00:58:15,613 --> 00:58:22,736
[SPEAKER_06]: Baywatch.de Let's go to another message here on the Orange Lounge Radio message line, then we're going to open it up for live calls very soon.

584
00:58:24,336 --> 00:58:26,757
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, Orange Lounge People, this is Goggles Chatroom.

585
00:58:29,295 --> 00:58:37,022
[SPEAKER_12]: Dream of Dream was one of the first songs I played in DDR, and I guess it always held a special place in my heart.

586
00:58:38,583 --> 00:58:46,029
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, and then I hung up.

587
00:58:46,990 --> 00:58:49,712
[SPEAKER_06]: No, Dream of Dream is one of the awesome DDR songs.

588
00:58:49,772 --> 00:58:53,515
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got to play that at some point tonight, because Dream of Dream, that's one of my favorite DDR songs as well.

589
00:58:54,448 --> 00:59:06,692
[SPEAKER_26]: Didn't I play that, like, when I first came up here and on, like, episode 37 or something and we went to, like, Stockton and, like, they had, like, a fourth mix there or something and I played it there?

590
00:59:08,390 --> 00:59:37,283
[SPEAKER_06]: possibly, Dream of Dreams debut was on 4th Mix and it's got a really, you know, the riff is from Hall of the Mountain King which is, you know, one of the, you know, like classic songs I do seem to recall that we went out and played like 4th or 5th Mix and probably that song came up because it's an easy as hell 7 footer but when I say easy, I mean fun like it was like a very constant, you know, the steps and a lot of people have fun with it if you're going to AAA heavy songs, Dream of Dreams is a good one to start off with

591
00:59:38,803 --> 00:59:39,624
[SPEAKER_26]: What are you talking about?

592
00:59:39,664 --> 00:59:41,705
[SPEAKER_26]: I still can't follow Heavy Arrows anyway.

593
00:59:43,127 --> 00:59:44,688
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know, it's a good song to warm up to.

594
00:59:44,708 --> 00:59:45,669
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a good song to warm up to.

595
00:59:45,689 --> 00:59:47,610
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, we got one more message on the message line.

596
00:59:47,630 --> 00:59:48,091
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go to it.

597
00:59:50,192 --> 00:59:51,473
[SPEAKER_21]: Hi, this is Illusion.

598
00:59:51,613 --> 00:59:53,615
[SPEAKER_21]: Everybody, you know, what do you like?

599
00:59:54,496 --> 01:00:04,884
[SPEAKER_21]: When I found out Captain Jack died, I was surprised, but I didn't think it would affect DVR much because we got all his recordings out of the way.

600
01:00:05,905 --> 01:00:08,227
[SPEAKER_21]: But, yeah, I was surprised and

601
01:00:09,787 --> 01:00:15,473
[SPEAKER_21]: It was a sad thing to hear, and I hope his family's doing just fine now.

602
01:00:17,175 --> 01:00:22,520
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, of course, Captain Jack, his family, gotta be taking this harder than anybody in the scene is.

603
01:00:24,542 --> 01:00:28,046
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously, our thoughts go out to Captain Jack's family and the surviving relatives.

604
01:00:30,239 --> 01:00:31,640
[SPEAKER_06]: How many times was Captain Jack married?

605
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:32,341
[SPEAKER_06]: Only once?

606
01:00:32,501 --> 01:00:33,902
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure.

607
01:00:34,122 --> 01:00:38,686
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the lead singer of Captain Jack at one point was his wife.

608
01:00:39,006 --> 01:00:42,249
[SPEAKER_06]: There were like four different women in Captain Jack at one point.

609
01:00:42,509 --> 01:00:45,872
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the first one was his wife at some point.

610
01:00:47,634 --> 01:00:48,715
[SPEAKER_06]: You think they were all his wives?

611
01:00:49,836 --> 01:00:50,176
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

612
01:00:51,317 --> 01:00:51,677
[SPEAKER_06]: Never mind.

613
01:00:52,698 --> 01:00:54,219
[SPEAKER_06]: He was in more women than they were in...

614
01:01:00,906 --> 01:01:01,446
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, shit.

615
01:01:01,526 --> 01:01:04,428
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, on that note, let's go skypline.

616
01:01:04,448 --> 01:01:07,870
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll take your calls on anything, anything you want to talk about within reason, kids.

617
01:01:07,930 --> 01:01:14,133
[SPEAKER_06]: You can either call us the old-fashioned way by loading up the skypline, or you can give us a call on the telephone.

618
01:01:14,213 --> 01:01:20,556
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, our brand-new telephone number that you can give us a call on, it is area code 916-226-9067.

619
01:01:22,838 --> 01:01:24,418
[SPEAKER_06]: Either way you want to do it there.

620
01:01:24,458 --> 01:01:28,220
[SPEAKER_06]: But, of course, kids, ask your parents' permission before calling because it might be a toll charge.

621
01:01:30,287 --> 01:01:30,507
[SPEAKER_06]: Sephiroth 1215

622
01:01:46,171 --> 01:01:48,774
[SPEAKER_30]: First of all, yeah, sadly Captain Jack died.

623
01:01:48,834 --> 01:01:57,001
[SPEAKER_30]: I actually had friends over when the news came up and they really even played EDR and even they were kind of awing.

624
01:01:57,722 --> 01:02:00,024
[SPEAKER_06]: Because they recognized the pimpness of Captain Jack.

625
01:02:00,424 --> 01:02:03,227
[SPEAKER_06]: Surely that guy had a ton of medals.

626
01:02:04,793 --> 01:02:05,453
[SPEAKER_06]: for a reason.

627
01:02:06,053 --> 01:02:06,374
[SPEAKER_30]: Yeah.

628
01:02:07,274 --> 01:02:07,514
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

629
01:02:08,494 --> 01:02:12,455
[SPEAKER_30]: I mean, hopefully, I'm sure they would do something in Ultramix 3, but I don't even know.

630
01:02:12,475 --> 01:02:15,576
[SPEAKER_30]: I don't think there's enough time for them to even put a little tribute in there.

631
01:02:15,817 --> 01:02:23,259
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be nice for them to say something like in the manual or something, but seeing as the game is probably already on its way to the

632
01:02:23,679 --> 01:02:38,292
[SPEAKER_06]: Pressing Mill before this news came out I wouldn't expect to see anything in Ultramix 3 regarding this maybe this time next year when the new DDR games come out assuming we're getting more DDR games next year but I don't see how we couldn't possibly be maybe we'll see something in Beatmania

633
01:02:38,712 --> 01:02:59,766
[SPEAKER_06]: although I don't know about that and the only way I guess maybe we'd get that is if the race showed up as one of the five key songs but you never know what might happen over at Konami so we'll see now we might see something in DDR Strike the Japanese DDR because that still isn't going to be coming out until early 2006 as far as we know so they have plenty of time to do something for Captain Jack if they want over there so we'll see

634
01:03:01,334 --> 01:03:23,512
[SPEAKER_30]: Yeah, yeah, hopefully they will, but on the same note, I mean, I got to play the demo of Ultramix 3, which, I mean, it, the demo actually was kind of broken, well, maybe it was just the disc, but it froze up a lot for me, but otherwise it played just the same as Ultramix 2, except for the bubbles, and that's it.

635
01:03:23,852 --> 01:03:30,234
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, from what I remember at E3, the game did play just like Ultramix 2 with maybe some minor differences, so I don't know.

636
01:03:30,274 --> 01:03:35,815
[SPEAKER_06]: But then again, Ultramix 2 is one of the better Bomani games they put out ever at the home, so if it ain't broke, don't fix it, right?

637
01:03:37,216 --> 01:03:38,596
[SPEAKER_30]: Oh yeah, yeah, I'm sure it'll be fine.

638
01:03:38,656 --> 01:03:40,016
[SPEAKER_30]: It was just a demo disc I got.

639
01:03:40,156 --> 01:03:41,757
[SPEAKER_30]: Yeah.

640
01:03:41,817 --> 01:03:49,839
[SPEAKER_30]: Otherwise, I saw an ad for it, and I believe it even said in the chatroom that

641
01:03:50,925 --> 01:03:53,547
[SPEAKER_30]: Run DMC is going to be in there with Walk This Way.

642
01:03:54,548 --> 01:03:54,949
[SPEAKER_30]: Really?

643
01:03:55,750 --> 01:03:55,930
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

644
01:03:55,950 --> 01:03:56,871
[SPEAKER_30]: Where did we hear that?

645
01:03:57,071 --> 01:03:58,372
[SPEAKER_30]: Was that on the podcast or something?

646
01:03:58,652 --> 01:03:59,253
[SPEAKER_30]: I might have missed it.

647
01:04:01,235 --> 01:04:07,080
[SPEAKER_30]: No, it was just in the chat room before and they have it advertised in an ad in a magazine.

648
01:04:07,841 --> 01:04:09,042
[SPEAKER_30]: They just have the background for it.

649
01:04:09,162 --> 01:04:09,482
[SPEAKER_30]: Wow.

650
01:04:09,622 --> 01:04:15,688
[SPEAKER_06]: It was based on like they saw there's a screenshot of a movie which looks like, you know, from the video.

651
01:04:16,343 --> 01:04:17,023
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

652
01:04:17,043 --> 01:04:23,806
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that would be a very interesting... I mean, obviously this is looking like one of the more diverse mixes we've gotten, so something like that wouldn't surprise me at all.

653
01:04:23,866 --> 01:04:29,007
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, MidiHead said that 80% of the music that was going to be in Ultramix 3 is going to be new to DDR.

654
01:04:29,147 --> 01:04:29,347
[SPEAKER_06]: Good!

655
01:04:30,468 --> 01:04:30,628
[SPEAKER_06]: Good.

656
01:04:30,908 --> 01:04:31,288
[SPEAKER_06]: Good news.

657
01:04:32,488 --> 01:04:34,869
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want the Japanese crossovers, go play Extreme 2.

658
01:04:35,169 --> 01:04:36,630
[SPEAKER_06]: Or go buy a Japanese PlayStation.

659
01:04:40,771 --> 01:04:42,072
[SPEAKER_30]: Also, the ad said that...

660
01:04:43,268 --> 01:04:47,312
[SPEAKER_30]: There's a new website called musicineverydirection.com.

661
01:04:47,972 --> 01:04:49,674
[SPEAKER_30]: I went today, but it's not even up yet.

662
01:04:50,875 --> 01:04:53,117
[SPEAKER_30]: And it also says coming soon to mobile.

663
01:04:53,958 --> 01:04:54,679
[SPEAKER_30]: What, DDR?

664
01:04:55,499 --> 01:04:55,820
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

665
01:04:56,280 --> 01:04:57,021
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of weird.

666
01:04:58,635 --> 01:05:00,836
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, well, it wouldn't surprise me, I guess.

667
01:05:00,876 --> 01:05:04,579
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they had Pump It Up on mobile overseas, so... And you know what?

668
01:05:04,619 --> 01:05:09,181
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Konami's been doing the mobile thing, because I downloaded Castlevania on the mobile phone, which, by the way, sucked.

669
01:05:10,022 --> 01:05:19,548
[SPEAKER_06]: But it was there, and it was on the mobile phone, so it wouldn't surprise me if DDR shows up on mobile, but I don't really get the point, because you can't dance, but whatever.

670
01:05:21,638 --> 01:05:23,238
[SPEAKER_30]: Yeah, whatever, I guess.

671
01:05:23,678 --> 01:05:24,038
[SPEAKER_30]: You're right.

672
01:05:25,599 --> 01:05:33,480
[SPEAKER_30]: Otherwise, the demo also has a demo of Castlevania, but I got really pissed off because that's the one demo that absolutely would not work on there.

673
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:34,020
[SPEAKER_30]: Really?

674
01:05:34,861 --> 01:05:35,361
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

675
01:05:35,581 --> 01:05:38,141
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I want to check out the Castlevania demo, though, but it doesn't work?

676
01:05:38,181 --> 01:05:40,282
[SPEAKER_06]: How did that get by QA?

677
01:05:41,822 --> 01:05:45,483
[SPEAKER_30]: It says that it's unable to read disk every time I try and do it.

678
01:05:46,443 --> 01:05:47,223
[SPEAKER_06]: Very interesting.

679
01:05:47,243 --> 01:05:47,463
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

680
01:05:47,912 --> 01:05:49,412
[SPEAKER_06]: Those merits coming out in two weeks anyways.

681
01:05:50,093 --> 01:05:51,853
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but we want to play a free demo.

682
01:05:53,014 --> 01:05:53,494
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever.

683
01:05:54,674 --> 01:05:55,734
[SPEAKER_06]: Free stuff rocks.

684
01:05:56,074 --> 01:05:56,495
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

685
01:05:57,635 --> 01:06:07,358
[SPEAKER_30]: Speaking of free stuff, Toys R Us now has a deal going on this week where you can buy two Xbox, PS2, or GameCube games and you get one free.

686
01:06:07,598 --> 01:06:07,998
[SPEAKER_30]: Any of them.

687
01:06:08,838 --> 01:06:09,158
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

688
01:06:09,279 --> 01:06:10,079
[SPEAKER_06]: Buy two, get one free?

689
01:06:11,039 --> 01:06:11,719
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

690
01:06:11,779 --> 01:06:14,480
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, man, I just bought two games at Toys R Us last week.

691
01:06:15,501 --> 01:06:16,121
[SPEAKER_06]: Bastards.

692
01:06:16,161 --> 01:06:17,801
[SPEAKER_06]: They always do that shit after I shop there.

693
01:06:17,841 --> 01:06:18,081
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, well.

694
01:06:18,702 --> 01:06:19,282
[SPEAKER_06]: That's cool, though.

695
01:06:19,362 --> 01:06:20,442
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, I'm going to have to go check that out.

696
01:06:20,462 --> 01:06:25,084
[SPEAKER_06]: I imagine they're probably trying to clear the shelves to make way for an Xbox 360 setup, but we'll see.

697
01:06:26,464 --> 01:06:26,845
[SPEAKER_30]: Maybe.

698
01:06:28,685 --> 01:06:30,526
[SPEAKER_30]: Otherwise, I guess that's it for me.

699
01:06:30,786 --> 01:06:31,026
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

700
01:06:31,286 --> 01:06:31,706
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds good.

701
01:06:31,766 --> 01:06:34,047
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for the call, and take care, Sephiroth, okay?

702
01:06:34,707 --> 01:06:35,487
[SPEAKER_30]: Okay, you too.

703
01:06:35,507 --> 01:06:35,768
[SPEAKER_06]: Later.

704
01:06:37,228 --> 01:06:37,928
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go to another call.

705
01:06:38,909 --> 01:06:39,689
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

706
01:06:42,748 --> 01:06:42,948
[SPEAKER_17]: Hello?

707
01:06:43,368 --> 01:06:43,648
[SPEAKER_17]: Hello?

708
01:06:44,128 --> 01:06:44,308
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

709
01:06:44,328 --> 01:06:44,748
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello.

710
01:06:44,948 --> 01:06:45,349
[SPEAKER_17]: Hello.

711
01:06:46,589 --> 01:06:47,569
[SPEAKER_17]: It's Nintendo Maniac 64.

712
01:06:48,549 --> 01:06:50,390
[SPEAKER_06]: How you doing, Nintendo Maniac 64?

713
01:06:51,350 --> 01:06:52,730
[SPEAKER_17]: By the way, I was not high.

714
01:06:53,130 --> 01:06:54,851
[SPEAKER_06]: I knew that was you that had called in earlier.

715
01:06:56,511 --> 01:07:04,993
[SPEAKER_06]: You tell me, though, how we're supposed to not think you're high, because, you know, you got the Dorito Craven going on, and you kind of had that voice on your message like, Hey, guys.

716
01:07:08,268 --> 01:07:10,350
[SPEAKER_17]: The phone, excuse me, it's not exactly the loudest thing.

717
01:07:11,071 --> 01:07:12,793
[SPEAKER_17]: I know, it's a cheap phone.

718
01:07:13,213 --> 01:07:14,935
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we have like five bucks on that.

719
01:07:15,236 --> 01:07:15,576
[SPEAKER_06]: What is that?

720
01:07:15,736 --> 01:07:18,760
[SPEAKER_06]: There's some noise in the background there that sounds like Christopher's car.

721
01:07:19,140 --> 01:07:19,581
[SPEAKER_06]: Like this is...

722
01:07:22,444 --> 01:07:24,085
[SPEAKER_06]: This is probably my laptop's fan.

723
01:07:24,325 --> 01:07:34,170
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay, because the belt on Christopher's car is like about to fall off or something, so every time he starts his car, like if we had a microphone cord that we could run outside, we probably wouldn't even need to get it outside, we'd just get it to the door.

724
01:07:34,291 --> 01:07:38,113
[SPEAKER_15]: Seriously, every single time I start the car, everybody thinks there's a fire going on somewhere.

725
01:07:38,293 --> 01:07:47,398
[SPEAKER_06]: I know when Christopher leaves for work in the morning, because like he'll turn on his car and then, like you hear this really loud belt noise that I'm sure wakes up all the neighbors.

726
01:07:47,438 --> 01:07:48,718
[SPEAKER_15]: I need to announce when I leave.

727
01:07:50,119 --> 01:07:51,660
[SPEAKER_06]: X the fun has left the building.

728
01:07:52,629 --> 01:07:53,510
[SPEAKER_17]: Excuse me.

729
01:07:54,391 --> 01:07:54,711
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright.

730
01:07:55,632 --> 01:08:00,638
[SPEAKER_17]: There is a song that actually has, like, pardon me, like, let's wake up the neighbors or something.

731
01:08:01,559 --> 01:08:03,100
[SPEAKER_06]: I usually play that when you're playing.

732
01:08:03,861 --> 01:08:10,008
[SPEAKER_06]: I just, you know, between you and me, we kind of live in the ghetto as it is, so I don't want to have music wars around here because we will lose.

733
01:08:13,825 --> 01:08:14,566
[SPEAKER_17]: What else is on your mind?

734
01:08:15,127 --> 01:08:15,627
[SPEAKER_17]: Doritos.

735
01:08:15,667 --> 01:08:17,369
[SPEAKER_06]: Doritos coming out tomorrow.

736
01:08:18,030 --> 01:08:18,691
[SPEAKER_06]: What's coming out tomorrow?

737
01:08:19,291 --> 01:08:20,313
[SPEAKER_06]: Mario Mix, DDR.

738
01:08:20,653 --> 01:08:22,095
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah, DDR Mario Mix.

739
01:08:22,115 --> 01:08:23,857
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, hell, the DDR I forgot all about.

740
01:08:24,337 --> 01:08:27,741
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, DDR Mario Mix is coming out tomorrow, and that's about all I have to say.

741
01:08:28,262 --> 01:08:31,566
[SPEAKER_06]: No, maybe I'll check it out, but at the same time,

742
01:08:34,543 --> 01:08:38,444
[SPEAKER_06]: It's easy, and it's chibi, and I don't know.

743
01:08:39,184 --> 01:08:41,725
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not looking forward to paying $60 for it.

744
01:08:42,425 --> 01:08:42,925
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?

745
01:08:43,665 --> 01:08:44,265
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I know.

746
01:08:44,625 --> 01:08:47,426
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I only have a GameCube because I'm not rich and stuff.

747
01:08:48,746 --> 01:08:50,046
[SPEAKER_17]: I can't afford many consoles.

748
01:08:50,786 --> 01:08:53,587
[SPEAKER_06]: Neither am I, but I sell drugs.

749
01:08:53,867 --> 01:08:54,707
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

750
01:08:54,727 --> 01:08:56,828
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and I sell Doritos.

751
01:08:59,511 --> 01:09:04,194
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I have a day job where I make decent money.

752
01:09:04,714 --> 01:09:05,655
[SPEAKER_06]: Selling drugs to kids.

753
01:09:05,735 --> 01:09:06,936
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I do not sell drugs to kids.

754
01:09:06,976 --> 01:09:07,836
[SPEAKER_06]: He sells drugs to kids.

755
01:09:07,856 --> 01:09:09,037
[SPEAKER_06]: I do not sell drugs to kids.

756
01:09:09,357 --> 01:09:10,518
[SPEAKER_06]: You might as well just get it out.

757
01:09:10,558 --> 01:09:12,479
[SPEAKER_06]: I sell drugs to nuns, not kids.

758
01:09:13,279 --> 01:09:13,539
[SPEAKER_06]: Nuns?

759
01:09:14,500 --> 01:09:15,941
[SPEAKER_15]: Kids that are in training to be nuns.

760
01:09:20,739 --> 01:09:31,005
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I have a day job, and since we live in the ghetto, my rent isn't very expensive, so I have leftover money to spend on things like Bomani Games and, you know, systems and drugs.

761
01:09:33,126 --> 01:09:33,526
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm kidding!

762
01:09:34,447 --> 01:09:36,128
[SPEAKER_06]: Drugs are for losers.

763
01:09:36,788 --> 01:09:37,629
[SPEAKER_15]: Unless you want some weed.

764
01:09:37,649 --> 01:09:38,169
[SPEAKER_06]: Except for Vicodin.

765
01:09:38,189 --> 01:09:38,870
[SPEAKER_06]: Vicodin is for winners.

766
01:09:45,011 --> 01:09:46,232
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of losers in high school.

767
01:09:46,472 --> 01:09:51,396
[SPEAKER_06]: What was that big FBI message that used to show up at the beginning of all the Capcom games like Final Fight and stuff?

768
01:09:51,656 --> 01:09:53,657
[SPEAKER_06]: Winners don't use drugs for the big FBI.

769
01:09:53,717 --> 01:09:55,318
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's like, dude, this is a video game.

770
01:09:55,358 --> 01:09:56,619
[SPEAKER_06]: Why are we... I don't know.

771
01:09:57,660 --> 01:09:59,081
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like community service.

772
01:09:59,201 --> 01:09:59,742
[SPEAKER_10]: What the heck?

773
01:10:00,442 --> 01:10:01,423
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, I'm being random.

774
01:10:02,204 --> 01:10:03,385
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, much like you.

775
01:10:06,408 --> 01:10:09,511
[SPEAKER_06]: Any other thoughts, Mr. Nintendomaniac64, before we go to another call?

776
01:10:10,212 --> 01:10:13,015
[SPEAKER_17]: I think my parents are right next door, like, making love to each other.

777
01:10:13,635 --> 01:10:13,936
[SPEAKER_17]: What?!

778
01:10:15,858 --> 01:10:16,438
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm serious.

779
01:10:16,538 --> 01:10:17,759
[SPEAKER_15]: I can tell you stories.

780
01:10:18,140 --> 01:10:19,161
[SPEAKER_15]: Wait, wait, wait.

781
01:10:19,181 --> 01:10:21,123
[SPEAKER_15]: Did he say the parents are next door?

782
01:10:21,683 --> 01:10:22,744
[SPEAKER_15]: Making love to each other.

783
01:10:23,405 --> 01:10:26,588
[SPEAKER_17]: My parents are, like, right next door to my room.

784
01:10:27,148 --> 01:10:27,288
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh-huh.

785
01:10:28,989 --> 01:10:30,030
[SPEAKER_17]: Are you hearing things?

786
01:10:31,131 --> 01:10:32,052
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, not much.

787
01:10:32,272 --> 01:10:33,373
[SPEAKER_17]: It's very mumbled.

788
01:10:34,073 --> 01:10:34,774
[SPEAKER_17]: And, like, muffled.

789
01:10:34,854 --> 01:10:37,236
[SPEAKER_06]: Would we be able to hear it if you put the phone next to the wall?

790
01:10:37,996 --> 01:10:38,577
[SPEAKER_06]: No, you wouldn't.

791
01:10:40,270 --> 01:10:41,451
[SPEAKER_06]: You make for bad radio.

792
01:10:41,471 --> 01:10:44,834
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you have any pictures on the wall that are kind of, like, vibrating?

793
01:10:44,854 --> 01:10:47,256
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what used to happen to me.

794
01:10:47,276 --> 01:10:48,097
[SPEAKER_15]: Dude, it's his parent.

795
01:10:48,177 --> 01:10:48,897
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, my God.

796
01:10:48,977 --> 01:10:52,280
[SPEAKER_15]: You've heard your... You know, I have stories.

797
01:10:53,761 --> 01:10:54,082
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, wow.

798
01:10:55,329 --> 01:10:56,390
[SPEAKER_15]: I do have stories, though.

799
01:10:57,211 --> 01:11:00,093
[SPEAKER_06]: Look, Captain Jack would have wanted us to talk about the bitches, alright?

800
01:11:01,374 --> 01:11:02,895
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, Captain Jack, I didn't say anything.

801
01:11:04,476 --> 01:11:06,438
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, now we definitely gotta let you go.

802
01:11:06,478 --> 01:11:07,979
[SPEAKER_06]: The chat room is about to have an aneurysm, okay?

803
01:11:08,660 --> 01:11:10,401
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, have a good one.

804
01:11:11,242 --> 01:11:12,022
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, bye.

805
01:11:13,343 --> 01:11:14,244
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go to another call.

806
01:11:15,025 --> 01:11:16,025
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

807
01:11:17,126 --> 01:11:17,527
[SPEAKER_24]: Really?

808
01:11:18,147 --> 01:11:18,387
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

809
01:11:20,249 --> 01:11:21,610
[SPEAKER_24]: It is I, E.T.

810
01:11:22,571 --> 01:11:22,731
[SPEAKER_05]: Who?

811
01:11:24,414 --> 01:11:24,754
[SPEAKER_05]: Dark.

812
01:11:25,655 --> 01:11:26,415
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, hey, what's up?

813
01:11:26,455 --> 01:11:26,975
[SPEAKER_06]: What's on your mind?

814
01:11:26,995 --> 01:11:29,937
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, I just thought I'd call.

815
01:11:30,997 --> 01:11:33,899
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the one and only Dark Tetsuya from our chatroom, boys and girls.

816
01:11:34,119 --> 01:11:34,739
[SPEAKER_06]: Yo, yo.

817
01:11:34,879 --> 01:11:36,080
[SPEAKER_24]: Hey, how's it going?

818
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:37,121
[SPEAKER_06]: Good, what's on your mind?

819
01:11:38,421 --> 01:11:41,143
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know, I just thought I'd call in.

820
01:11:42,503 --> 01:11:46,766
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you're utilizing our new phone line, I can see, from the caller ID, so.

821
01:11:47,226 --> 01:11:49,507
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I, yeah.

822
01:11:50,225 --> 01:11:50,585
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

823
01:11:50,705 --> 01:11:51,786
[SPEAKER_06]: You have a caller ID on that?

824
01:11:51,826 --> 01:11:52,747
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we have a caller ID on here.

825
01:11:52,767 --> 01:11:55,028
[SPEAKER_06]: So if we get crank callers, we know who you are.

826
01:11:55,048 --> 01:11:56,309
[SPEAKER_15]: We can stop 69 your ass.

827
01:11:56,629 --> 01:11:57,830
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to stop 69 your ass.

828
01:11:58,110 --> 01:11:58,930
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, what's on your mind?

829
01:12:00,451 --> 01:12:02,212
[SPEAKER_06]: What was your reaction to the news about Captain Jack?

830
01:12:03,433 --> 01:12:06,575
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, that was a total surprise.

831
01:12:07,795 --> 01:12:09,617
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it was very sudden because he was so young, obviously.

832
01:12:10,377 --> 01:12:10,797
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, yeah.

833
01:12:12,178 --> 01:12:14,019
[SPEAKER_24]: No, my brother was a big fan of his.

834
01:12:15,640 --> 01:12:16,921
[SPEAKER_06]: Is your brother much of a DDR player?

835
01:12:18,422 --> 01:12:18,862
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, he is.

836
01:12:23,271 --> 01:12:23,991
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, very cool.

837
01:12:26,092 --> 01:12:32,575
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah, it was kind of a bummer, because it was very sudden and everything, and he kind of died young, which is really too bad.

838
01:12:32,655 --> 01:12:33,135
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I know.

839
01:12:34,296 --> 01:12:35,156
[SPEAKER_06]: It sucks, X-Fur.

840
01:12:35,176 --> 01:12:35,816
[SPEAKER_06]: It really sucks.

841
01:12:36,257 --> 01:12:38,458
[SPEAKER_06]: And some people are really hurting, X-Fur.

842
01:12:40,378 --> 01:12:40,839
Bastard.

843
01:12:41,239 --> 01:12:43,340
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, what else is on your mind, DT?

844
01:12:48,784 --> 01:12:51,586
[SPEAKER_06]: Any cool games you've been playing this week you want to tell us about?

845
01:12:51,606 --> 01:12:52,687
[SPEAKER_06]: Just Extreme 2.

846
01:12:53,348 --> 01:12:54,509
[SPEAKER_06]: Extreme 2, how's that going?

847
01:12:54,529 --> 01:12:55,609
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you unlocked all the songs yet?

848
01:12:56,830 --> 01:12:58,552
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh no, I had to start over.

849
01:12:58,592 --> 01:13:00,793
[SPEAKER_24]: I tripped over the power cord.

850
01:13:01,994 --> 01:13:03,856
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh shit, you tripped over the power cord?

851
01:13:04,396 --> 01:13:07,058
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

852
01:13:07,458 --> 01:13:08,919
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh no, that's the worst.

853
01:13:08,999 --> 01:13:10,781
[SPEAKER_06]: Like when the game was saving or something?

854
01:13:11,221 --> 01:13:13,403
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, when it was booting up.

855
01:13:15,042 --> 01:13:24,947
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm always afraid that that's going to happen to me, like when it says do not pull out the memory card, especially on those games that take forever to save to the memory card because the files are so huge, like a game like Cold Step or something.

856
01:13:27,128 --> 01:13:31,550
[SPEAKER_06]: When the file's saving, I'm afraid that Thunder's going to hit and then turn off my PlayStation 2.

857
01:13:31,650 --> 01:13:34,331
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be God's little joke on me, honestly.

858
01:13:34,692 --> 01:13:35,952
[SPEAKER_07]: Hehehe, I erased your file.

859
01:13:36,813 --> 01:13:37,833
[SPEAKER_07]: Hehehe, 27 hours on the game.

860
01:13:37,873 --> 01:13:39,814
[SPEAKER_07]: Hehehe, you're going to hell.

861
01:13:41,195 --> 01:13:43,676
[SPEAKER_29]: Alright, any other thoughts for us, DT, before we get on to another call?

862
01:13:45,615 --> 01:13:46,636
[SPEAKER_24]: No, that's about it.

863
01:13:46,716 --> 01:13:51,278
[SPEAKER_24]: I did unlock Section D on the Dance Master mode.

864
01:13:51,859 --> 01:13:52,299
[SPEAKER_24]: Which song?

865
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:54,661
[SPEAKER_24]: So that's been kicking my ass.

866
01:13:54,941 --> 01:13:55,221
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

867
01:13:57,222 --> 01:13:58,363
[SPEAKER_24]: So that's pretty much it.

868
01:13:58,883 --> 01:13:59,263
[SPEAKER_06]: Alrighty.

869
01:13:59,483 --> 01:14:00,404
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you for calling.

870
01:14:00,424 --> 01:14:01,425
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, thanks for calling.

871
01:14:01,505 --> 01:14:01,925
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.

872
01:14:02,125 --> 01:14:02,385
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

873
01:14:02,906 --> 01:14:03,566
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a good one.

874
01:14:03,806 --> 01:14:04,086
[SPEAKER_06]: Later.

875
01:14:06,147 --> 01:14:09,009
[SPEAKER_06]: Our Skype line is screaming popular tonight.

876
01:14:09,510 --> 01:14:10,330
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go to another call.

877
01:14:10,870 --> 01:14:11,811
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.

878
01:14:13,072 --> 01:14:13,913
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, this is Dark Knight.

879
01:14:14,033 --> 01:14:15,013
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, Dark Knight, what's up?

880
01:14:15,594 --> 01:14:16,334
[SPEAKER_15]: Yo, yo, yo.

881
01:14:17,395 --> 01:14:17,855
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, DJ.

882
01:14:17,876 --> 01:14:19,477
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, what's up?

883
01:14:20,658 --> 01:14:27,042
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought I'd just pass along this for you about what I heard about Yahoo maybe trying a little DDR themselves.

884
01:14:27,743 --> 01:14:29,364
[SPEAKER_08]: Yahoo is getting into DDR?

885
01:14:31,013 --> 01:14:40,319
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, apparently they put out like a little game from Wild Tangent or something like that called Dance on Mag or Dance Groove or something like that.

886
01:14:40,359 --> 01:14:40,619
[SPEAKER_06]: Aw, fuck.

887
01:14:40,679 --> 01:14:45,281
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't Wild Tangent... Loki, wasn't Wild Tangent the one that did Tappa Jam?

888
01:14:45,642 --> 01:14:46,942
[SPEAKER_06]: Or am I confusing that with somebody else?

889
01:14:47,143 --> 01:14:50,344
[SPEAKER_06]: You remember that Tappa Jam, the one that was like Beatmania but it was all like classical songs?

890
01:14:50,364 --> 01:14:51,145
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think that was.

891
01:14:51,165 --> 01:14:51,565
[SPEAKER_06]: Was that them?

892
01:14:51,905 --> 01:14:53,006
[SPEAKER_06]: Wild Tangent does something.

893
01:14:53,066 --> 01:14:56,228
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Wild Tangent actually... No, Wild Tangent does the shitty AOL games.

894
01:14:57,569 --> 01:15:04,153
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought they were just, it was just like some sort of, um, like a script package or something like that.

895
01:15:04,233 --> 01:15:07,255
[SPEAKER_08]: Devil work, that's what it is, devil, devil stuff.

896
01:15:08,036 --> 01:15:08,236
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

897
01:15:09,116 --> 01:15:11,918
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, I took a look at this game and everything, right?

898
01:15:12,599 --> 01:15:18,602
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, they do, like, Buster Groove, but they also have, like, a little DDR mode as well mixed into it.

899
01:15:20,123 --> 01:15:23,946
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's, oh, wait, I think I've played, you know what, I think I've played a game like this before.

900
01:15:24,366 --> 01:15:27,568
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, I think I pointed it out like a long time ago on AIM.

901
01:15:27,729 --> 01:15:30,671
[SPEAKER_06]: But I didn't, it wasn't a Yahoo game, it was an AIM game.

902
01:15:30,691 --> 01:15:35,034
[SPEAKER_26]: No, yeah, it was an AIM game, but maybe they're like Licensing it out to Yahoo.

903
01:15:35,094 --> 01:15:35,715
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, exactly.

904
01:15:35,735 --> 01:15:39,157
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe, okay, because that would make sense because if Wild Tangent did the AOL games Right.

905
01:15:39,858 --> 01:15:43,440
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, okay, so this game is about to get a little bit bigger it looks like.

906
01:15:43,560 --> 01:15:44,081
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, brother.

907
01:15:44,201 --> 01:15:45,101
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, goody, goody, goody.

908
01:15:45,182 --> 01:15:45,662
[SPEAKER_26]: Yay.

909
01:15:47,243 --> 01:15:48,424
[SPEAKER_08]: It looked weird, I was like

910
01:15:49,342 --> 01:15:50,683
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait, man, this is like Busted Groove.

911
01:15:50,963 --> 01:15:52,684
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait, man, this is like DDR.

912
01:15:53,325 --> 01:15:56,607
[SPEAKER_06]: I suppose imitation is the finest form of flattery?

913
01:15:57,347 --> 01:15:57,908
[SPEAKER_06]: Very much.

914
01:15:58,808 --> 01:16:03,971
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, with the gallon there, the only problem is that if you have a slow computer, of course, the timing will be atrocious.

915
01:16:04,632 --> 01:16:05,172
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.

916
01:16:05,652 --> 01:16:10,595
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember, I seem to recall that, was that it was a very slow game.

917
01:16:10,635 --> 01:16:12,717
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, even on my computer, which is kind of, you know, it's nice.

918
01:16:12,797 --> 01:16:14,058
[SPEAKER_06]: It was kind of a slow-running game.

919
01:16:14,458 --> 01:16:16,319
[SPEAKER_06]: Not a very optimized game, so...

920
01:16:16,579 --> 01:16:26,945
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but here's another weird story about how McDonald's might be, McDonald's will let Nintendo DS owners play the Wi-Fi servers.

921
01:16:27,406 --> 01:16:29,507
[SPEAKER_06]: I heard about this, the Wi-Fi at McDonald's.

922
01:16:29,607 --> 01:16:33,870
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, when I think about, here, let me think about places I want to go play my DS.

923
01:16:33,950 --> 01:16:35,431
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think, oh, McD's.

924
01:16:38,072 --> 01:16:45,537
[SPEAKER_06]: McDonald's was cool for social gatherings when I was six years old and some kid would have their birthday party there because their parents were poor.

925
01:16:45,973 --> 01:16:48,434
[SPEAKER_06]: and couldn't afford anything but a McDonald's birthday party.

926
01:16:48,755 --> 01:16:49,315
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

927
01:16:50,416 --> 01:16:57,840
[SPEAKER_08]: It's funny though, I was like, you get beat in there, and I was like, yeah, I would like a Big Mac, an order of fries, and a Wi-Fi connection.

928
01:16:59,701 --> 01:17:01,282
[SPEAKER_06]: Would you like to supersize your Wi-Fi?

929
01:17:02,122 --> 01:17:02,703
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I would.

930
01:17:03,772 --> 01:17:05,333
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, that's going to be interesting.

931
01:17:05,393 --> 01:17:07,934
[SPEAKER_06]: So McDonald's is going to become the DS hotspot.

932
01:17:08,214 --> 01:17:09,894
[SPEAKER_26]: I believe I read that on Slashdot.

933
01:17:10,334 --> 01:17:12,295
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I read that somewhere on the internet this week.

934
01:17:12,375 --> 01:17:13,096
[SPEAKER_06]: It's interesting.

935
01:17:14,136 --> 01:17:16,377
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's weird how they send this all up.

936
01:17:16,437 --> 01:17:21,239
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like Nintendo DS Wi-Fi, open up to everybody in the U.S.

937
01:17:21,459 --> 01:17:22,339
[SPEAKER_08]: How about McDonald's now?

938
01:17:23,139 --> 01:17:29,302
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I seem to remember, though, didn't McDonald's also at one point have Nintendo 64s in a lot of their stores for kids to play?

939
01:17:29,682 --> 01:17:32,143
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like a little toy, I guess it was.

940
01:17:33,223 --> 01:17:36,745
[SPEAKER_06]: So Nintendo and McDonald's are kind of teaming up a little bit here, I see.

941
01:17:37,005 --> 01:17:45,088
[SPEAKER_26]: I was going to say that, like, the, what do you call it, the Ronald House thing that I'm trying to, for like sick kids and stuff.

942
01:17:45,148 --> 01:17:45,508
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, okay.

943
01:17:45,528 --> 01:17:46,589
[SPEAKER_26]: They actually did that.

944
01:17:46,649 --> 01:17:52,531
[SPEAKER_26]: They built the cabinet for, you know, it had like a TV and a Nintendo 64 and stuff, so you're right.

945
01:17:54,272 --> 01:17:58,654
[SPEAKER_08]: But one time, somebody said Burger King had a DDR machine or something like that.

946
01:18:00,184 --> 01:18:00,524
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

947
01:18:00,564 --> 01:18:01,305
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing surprises me.

948
01:18:01,385 --> 01:18:02,885
[SPEAKER_06]: Franchise owners can get away with a lot.

949
01:18:03,206 --> 01:18:03,866
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

950
01:18:03,886 --> 01:18:05,407
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm thinking McDonald's might get it first.

951
01:18:05,447 --> 01:18:08,028
[SPEAKER_08]: They did do like a little commercial with it.

952
01:18:08,088 --> 01:18:08,908
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see what happens.

953
01:18:08,928 --> 01:18:09,469
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be interesting.

954
01:18:09,749 --> 01:18:11,710
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm curious to see what happens with the Nintendo Wi-Fi.

955
01:18:11,930 --> 01:18:16,372
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, you know, McDonald's has tried to do the social gathering thing before, but more at a kid-oriented audience.

956
01:18:16,392 --> 01:18:20,794
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's things like, okay, remember when they released those 101 Dalmatian toys in the Happy Meals?

957
01:18:20,994 --> 01:18:21,274
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes.

958
01:18:21,414 --> 01:18:21,694
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

959
01:18:21,815 --> 01:18:24,436
[SPEAKER_06]: And they would have like Tuesday trade night or whatever.

960
01:18:24,876 --> 01:18:26,177
[SPEAKER_06]: And sure, it was a bunch of little kids.

961
01:18:26,437 --> 01:18:28,698
[SPEAKER_06]: But do you know who was really trading that stuff?

962
01:18:30,293 --> 01:18:33,415
[SPEAKER_06]: Their parents were trading those 101 Dalmatians.

963
01:18:33,455 --> 01:18:34,136
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't the kids.

964
01:18:34,156 --> 01:18:35,057
[SPEAKER_06]: It was the damn parents.

965
01:18:35,077 --> 01:18:36,638
[SPEAKER_06]: Beanie Babies.

966
01:18:36,738 --> 01:18:37,558
[SPEAKER_06]: Beanie Babies.

967
01:18:37,638 --> 01:18:38,759
[SPEAKER_06]: McDonald's Beanie Babies.

968
01:18:38,899 --> 01:18:39,539
[SPEAKER_06]: Good God.

969
01:18:39,900 --> 01:18:41,060
[SPEAKER_15]: I used to work at McDonald's.

970
01:18:41,080 --> 01:18:42,301
[SPEAKER_06]: You used to work at McDonald's during that time, right?

971
01:18:42,321 --> 01:18:44,142
[SPEAKER_15]: I have all of the Beanie Babies in my room.

972
01:18:44,303 --> 01:18:44,703
[SPEAKER_15]: All of them.

973
01:18:45,183 --> 01:18:47,725
[SPEAKER_06]: Who would show up more at those Beanie Baby exchange nights?

974
01:18:47,765 --> 01:18:48,645
[SPEAKER_06]: Kids or their parents?

975
01:18:48,825 --> 01:18:49,266
[SPEAKER_06]: Soccer moms.

976
01:18:49,286 --> 01:18:51,027
[SPEAKER_08]: Soccer moms.

977
01:18:53,587 --> 01:18:53,907
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

978
01:18:54,048 --> 01:18:56,430
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, that's all the news I got for you tonight.

979
01:18:56,530 --> 01:19:01,995
[SPEAKER_08]: I should have some more in the coming weeks, but right now those are like the two major ones that are coming up.

980
01:19:02,015 --> 01:19:06,479
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, we appreciate you contributing positively to the show, unlike Extifer.

981
01:19:07,540 --> 01:19:10,543
[SPEAKER_15]: Bye, DK.

982
01:19:11,564 --> 01:19:12,024
[SPEAKER_15]: You too.

983
01:19:12,045 --> 01:19:13,226
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, bye, Dark Knight.

984
01:19:13,246 --> 01:19:13,786
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a good one.

985
01:19:14,106 --> 01:19:14,647
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

986
01:19:16,369 --> 01:19:17,430
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, Extifer.

987
01:19:17,970 --> 01:19:18,651
[SPEAKER_06]: Kisses.

988
01:19:21,482 --> 01:19:22,203
[SPEAKER_06]: TOTAL SILENCE

989
01:19:35,805 --> 01:19:45,672
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I felt kind of sad when I discovered Captain Jack was dead, because the first time I played his song was Captain Jack 3rd Mix Grandale.

990
01:19:46,953 --> 01:19:48,394
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people's first songs.

991
01:19:50,355 --> 01:19:52,457
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of people's first Captain Jack song, definitely.

992
01:19:53,437 --> 01:20:01,263
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and I just really liked the song, and I liked it even better when I heard the full version, because I just thought it was awesome.

993
01:20:01,983 --> 01:20:05,446
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was just wondering, could you please get Captain Jack Little Boy on there?

994
01:20:06,070 --> 01:20:08,851
[SPEAKER_06]: We will work in Captain Jack Little Boy on our next break.

995
01:20:08,911 --> 01:20:09,311
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.

996
01:20:10,271 --> 01:20:10,492
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.

997
01:20:10,952 --> 01:20:13,473
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

998
01:20:13,693 --> 01:20:15,513
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a pretty quick request there.

999
01:20:16,414 --> 01:20:16,994
[SPEAKER_06]: Play Little Boy.

1000
01:20:17,054 --> 01:20:17,274
[SPEAKER_06]: Click.

1001
01:20:19,215 --> 01:20:19,875
[SPEAKER_06]: We're fine.

1002
01:20:19,935 --> 01:20:22,736
[SPEAKER_06]: Even if you're going to hang up and ditch, maybe I won't play it.

1003
01:20:22,956 --> 01:20:24,096
[SPEAKER_15]: He just called ditched us.

1004
01:20:24,456 --> 01:20:25,957
[SPEAKER_06]: He totally just called ditched us.

1005
01:20:26,017 --> 01:20:26,477
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all right.

1006
01:20:27,898 --> 01:20:29,098
[SPEAKER_06]: I know the Skype thing's new.

1007
01:20:31,879 --> 01:20:34,400
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm surprised we don't get crank calls more on this program.

1008
01:20:36,067 --> 01:20:36,827
[SPEAKER_26]: Don't say that!

1009
01:20:36,867 --> 01:20:38,548
[SPEAKER_26]: People are actually going to do it now.

1010
01:20:39,088 --> 01:20:41,709
[SPEAKER_06]: I scared them already because I told them we have ways of finding out who they are.

1011
01:20:41,929 --> 01:20:46,710
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, if you want to listen to my show tomorrow, you can call Ditch Me.

1012
01:20:47,150 --> 01:20:47,450
[SPEAKER_06]: It's cool.

1013
01:20:47,510 --> 01:20:49,571
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let's go to another call.

1014
01:20:49,931 --> 01:20:51,231
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go to another call.

1015
01:20:51,351 --> 01:20:53,772
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange House Radio.

1016
01:20:54,092 --> 01:20:54,432
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey.

1017
01:20:54,452 --> 01:20:54,492
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi.

1018
01:20:55,432 --> 01:20:56,812
[SPEAKER_27]: Is it actually working this time?

1019
01:20:56,872 --> 01:20:57,953
[SPEAKER_06]: It is actually working.

1020
01:20:58,013 --> 01:20:59,253
[SPEAKER_06]: I hear you loud and clear.

1021
01:20:59,533 --> 01:21:00,873
[SPEAKER_06]: Who is this?

1022
01:21:01,133 --> 01:21:01,854
[SPEAKER_27]: This is Roz.

1023
01:21:01,994 --> 01:21:02,514
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, Roz.

1024
01:21:02,534 --> 01:21:03,054
[SPEAKER_06]: What's on your mind?

1025
01:21:04,740 --> 01:21:06,501
[SPEAKER_27]: Um, not too much.

1026
01:21:08,183 --> 01:21:11,805
[SPEAKER_27]: I just got home from a fun experience.

1027
01:21:12,806 --> 01:21:14,487
[SPEAKER_06]: Ooh, fun experience, huh?

1028
01:21:14,807 --> 01:21:15,647
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell us more about it.

1029
01:21:16,528 --> 01:21:25,494
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, I sat in church for an hour watching the bishop of the diocese say the rosary and sitting next to an old lady who wouldn't stop clearing her throat.

1030
01:21:26,240 --> 01:21:28,402
[SPEAKER_06]: You have a very strange definition of fun experience.

1031
01:21:30,243 --> 01:21:30,724
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to say.

1032
01:21:30,744 --> 01:21:32,085
[SPEAKER_27]: It was annoying as shit.

1033
01:21:32,305 --> 01:21:32,905
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, there you go.

1034
01:21:32,925 --> 01:21:33,286
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1035
01:21:35,047 --> 01:21:35,808
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't lie to us.

1036
01:21:35,908 --> 01:21:36,488
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't lie to us.

1037
01:21:36,568 --> 01:21:38,490
[SPEAKER_06]: That was not a fun experience.

1038
01:21:38,510 --> 01:21:42,833
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a, I think I want to crawl under the pew experience.

1039
01:21:42,913 --> 01:21:44,094
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, yeah.

1040
01:21:44,214 --> 01:21:47,537
[SPEAKER_27]: Afterwards, I ran into the house and took a shower.

1041
01:21:47,557 --> 01:21:49,339
[SPEAKER_27]: So, I'm good.

1042
01:21:53,141 --> 01:21:55,942
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki's sitting in the back there, by the way, going, now we're talking.

1043
01:21:56,282 --> 01:21:56,943
[SPEAKER_06]: Pervert.

1044
01:21:58,823 --> 01:21:59,164
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, yeah.

1045
01:21:59,304 --> 01:21:59,984
[SPEAKER_27]: Fantasize.

1046
01:22:00,344 --> 01:22:01,364
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1047
01:22:01,925 --> 01:22:02,685
[SPEAKER_26]: I encourage it.

1048
01:22:03,005 --> 01:22:07,527
[SPEAKER_26]: Now I wonder why I associate with these guys.

1049
01:22:07,967 --> 01:22:08,387
[SPEAKER_26]: Never mind.

1050
01:22:08,427 --> 01:22:09,227
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, come on.

1051
01:22:09,247 --> 01:22:10,228
[SPEAKER_26]: You know you like it.

1052
01:22:10,288 --> 01:22:13,269
[SPEAKER_06]: To our credit, two of us are gay, you know.

1053
01:22:14,318 --> 01:22:15,679
[SPEAKER_06]: It's okay, I can hang out with the women.

1054
01:22:16,701 --> 01:22:17,061
[SPEAKER_15]: It's cool.

1055
01:22:17,722 --> 01:22:18,262
[SPEAKER_06]: I like women.

1056
01:22:18,703 --> 01:22:19,704
[SPEAKER_15]: I like women too.

1057
01:22:19,724 --> 01:22:20,945
[SPEAKER_15]: They're fun to shop with, anyway.

1058
01:22:21,185 --> 01:22:22,226
[SPEAKER_15]: And play around with.

1059
01:22:23,267 --> 01:22:24,629
[SPEAKER_15]: Play around meaning shop with.

1060
01:22:24,649 --> 01:22:26,451
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1061
01:22:26,551 --> 01:22:26,971
[SPEAKER_06]: God.

1062
01:22:27,572 --> 01:22:28,653
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, now he changed it.

1063
01:22:28,753 --> 01:22:31,456
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, let's let our caller talk a little more there.

1064
01:22:31,796 --> 01:22:32,537
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, caller.

1065
01:22:32,557 --> 01:22:36,381
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm hitting the chat, and like, everyone seems horribly surprised that I'm a girl.

1066
01:22:37,621 --> 01:22:51,153
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what, for some reason it's like this big thing like OMG a gamer girl Although like, I thought that was like years old now There's plenty of gamer girls out there now Actually, when I first walked into that chat room Are you a guy?

1067
01:22:51,673 --> 01:23:01,222
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, no Wow, no, there's plenty of girls that play video games of all types now And you have a super sounding voice too

1068
01:23:03,613 --> 01:23:04,734
[SPEAKER_15]: I just thought I would say that.

1069
01:23:04,794 --> 01:23:06,215
[SPEAKER_15]: Geez, don't look at me like that, Skye.

1070
01:23:06,475 --> 01:23:07,516
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just saying.

1071
01:23:07,536 --> 01:23:10,198
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, okay, if you want to pay the callers a compliment, not a problem.

1072
01:23:10,238 --> 01:23:18,324
[SPEAKER_15]: It sounds like you would be a good addition to listening to my show starting tomorrow at 7 o'clock PST.

1073
01:23:19,144 --> 01:23:19,965
[SPEAKER_06]: He ain't too proud to beg.

1074
01:23:21,606 --> 01:23:26,349
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, I'm all up in the East Coast, so, you know.

[SPEAKER_06]: So, like, 10 o'clock?

1076
01:23:28,331 --> 01:23:30,032
[SPEAKER_06]: She's got to go to bed by the time your show comes on.

1077
01:23:30,592 --> 01:23:32,454
[SPEAKER_15]: What do you have going on in the morning on Tuesday?

1078
01:23:32,494 --> 01:23:32,794
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

1079
01:23:33,732 --> 01:23:35,473
[SPEAKER_06]: Stop berating the listeners, Extover.

1080
01:23:35,853 --> 01:23:36,193
[SPEAKER_06]: Stop it.

1081
01:23:36,954 --> 01:23:38,335
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to talk serious here for a minute.

1082
01:23:38,355 --> 01:23:40,716
[SPEAKER_06]: It's after primetime program.

1083
01:23:40,776 --> 01:23:42,037
[SPEAKER_06]: Extover, I will take your mic away.

1084
01:23:43,498 --> 01:23:45,479
[SPEAKER_06]: Ross, I need to know your thoughts on Captain Jack.

1085
01:23:46,700 --> 01:23:55,805
[SPEAKER_27]: You know, I had no idea until after I got home from the church and being coughed on by that old lady.

1086
01:23:56,745 --> 01:24:02,849
[SPEAKER_27]: I came back, I checked the site, and I was like, holy shit, because I had no idea.

1087
01:24:04,172 --> 01:24:04,873
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what else to say.

1088
01:24:24,921 --> 01:24:26,362
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, Roz, well, thanks for the call.

1089
01:24:26,602 --> 01:24:30,084
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're going to let you go so we can get to some more calls because our line is lighting up tonight.

[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, I'm glad it worked this time.

01:24:34,366 --> 01:24:34,767
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.

1094
01:24:34,787 --> 01:24:35,387
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad, too.

1095
01:24:35,547 --> 01:24:36,067
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad to hear it.

1096
01:24:36,828 --> 01:24:37,648
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, take care, Roz.

1097
01:24:38,389 --> 01:24:38,609
[SPEAKER_27]: Bye.

1098
01:24:38,749 --> 01:24:39,189
[SPEAKER_27]: Bye-bye.

1099
01:24:40,710 --> 01:24:41,450
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go to another call.

1100
01:24:42,311 --> 01:24:42,891
[SPEAKER_06]: One more, at least.

1101
01:24:43,211 --> 01:24:43,992
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1102
01:24:45,563 --> 01:24:48,245
[SPEAKER_18]: Hey, this is GS191 in the chat rooms.

1103
01:24:48,585 --> 01:24:50,746
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, GS191 in the chat rooms.

1104
01:24:50,806 --> 01:24:51,126
[SPEAKER_06]: What's up?

1105
01:24:52,327 --> 01:24:52,767
[SPEAKER_18]: Not much.

1106
01:24:53,188 --> 01:24:56,350
[SPEAKER_18]: I just heard about Captain Jack just now.

1107
01:24:57,030 --> 01:24:58,851
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm very, very shocked.

1108
01:24:58,931 --> 01:25:01,292
[SPEAKER_06]: Amazing that people actually get their news from our show.

1109
01:25:01,593 --> 01:25:04,454
[SPEAKER_06]: I always thought that we were the redundancy of the Internet.

1110
01:25:04,474 --> 01:25:06,916
[SPEAKER_06]: But no, that's interesting.

1111
01:25:06,976 --> 01:25:09,297
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, I'm sorry you had to find out through our show.

1112
01:25:11,078 --> 01:25:12,259
[SPEAKER_06]: But what do you think?

1113
01:25:12,319 --> 01:25:13,380
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's kind of sudden, huh?

1114
01:25:14,440 --> 01:25:19,263
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I remember back in the really, really old days of, like, the third mix, Korean version 2.

1115
01:25:19,463 --> 01:25:20,823
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, yes.

1116
01:25:21,063 --> 01:25:21,424
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, yes.

1117
01:25:22,684 --> 01:25:25,346
[SPEAKER_18]: I did not... Shit.

1118
01:25:27,167 --> 01:25:28,107
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, you could tell it was the first time.

1119
01:25:28,147 --> 01:25:28,507
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all right.

1120
01:25:29,028 --> 01:25:29,548
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

1121
01:25:29,808 --> 01:25:30,848
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just internet radio.

1122
01:25:30,929 --> 01:25:32,890
[SPEAKER_06]: No one expects anything, so... Yeah.

1123
01:25:32,930 --> 01:25:33,650
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all good, man.

1124
01:25:34,030 --> 01:25:37,052
[SPEAKER_06]: Look, if we can get a show, anything can happen.

1125
01:25:37,072 --> 01:25:37,452
[SPEAKER_06]: If I can get a show?

1126
01:25:37,532 --> 01:25:41,574
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, if Extaper can get a show, anything goes on the internet, so feel free.

1127
01:25:41,594 --> 01:25:42,174
[SPEAKER_06]: Say anything.

1128
01:25:42,194 --> 01:25:42,534
[SPEAKER_06]: Just relax.

1129
01:25:42,635 --> 01:25:42,795
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything.

1130
01:25:42,855 --> 01:25:43,255
[SPEAKER_15]: Anything.

1131
01:25:45,745 --> 01:25:50,970
[SPEAKER_18]: I remember playing the Ray song on the third mix, and that was my first Captain Jack song, and I loved it.

1132
01:25:52,892 --> 01:26:01,520
[SPEAKER_18]: When I got home, I frantically tried to search for the long version, found it, and put it on repeat on my CD player for a long, long time.

1133
01:26:02,481 --> 01:26:05,103
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what a lot of people do with DDR music when they first play the game.

1134
01:26:05,983 --> 01:26:09,266
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you can see the life of a DDR noob.

1135
01:26:09,627 --> 01:26:18,314
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like they play the game, then they find that song they like, then they burn their first DDR CD and they listen to it over and over and over again in the car, and then they're playing it to all their friends.

1136
01:26:18,414 --> 01:26:20,856
[SPEAKER_26]: Like, listen to this really cheesy DDR music.

1137
01:26:21,176 --> 01:26:21,957
[SPEAKER_06]: That was me, anyway.

1138
01:26:22,657 --> 01:26:24,699
[SPEAKER_26]: As Angel turns bright red.

1139
01:26:24,939 --> 01:26:26,060
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that's what Angel did, too.

1140
01:26:26,160 --> 01:26:27,261
[SPEAKER_06]: You know it, you know it, guys.

1141
01:26:28,422 --> 01:26:29,083
[SPEAKER_26]: Because Angel...

1142
01:26:30,743 --> 01:26:30,963
[SPEAKER_26]: Angel

1143
01:26:44,666 --> 01:26:46,227
[SPEAKER_18]: and I've been playing it non-stop.

1144
01:26:47,748 --> 01:26:49,069
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a great game, it really is.

1145
01:26:49,349 --> 01:26:50,449
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, it's a great game.

1146
01:26:50,750 --> 01:26:52,110
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm looking forward to Ultramix 3.

1147
01:26:52,591 --> 01:26:55,172
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be a heck of a fall with the Bomani releases.

1148
01:26:55,192 --> 01:26:55,892
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm very excited.

1149
01:26:56,893 --> 01:26:57,533
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh yeah, me too.

1150
01:26:58,074 --> 01:26:59,694
[SPEAKER_06]: Not just Captain Jack, but the whole variety.

1151
01:26:59,915 --> 01:27:01,896
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the MySpace DDR mix.

1152
01:27:02,676 --> 01:27:04,257
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be a fun time.

1153
01:27:04,958 --> 01:27:07,159
[SPEAKER_18]: God, God, I hate Good Charlotte.

1154
01:27:07,179 --> 01:27:08,520
[SPEAKER_18]: I want them to burn in hell.

1155
01:27:08,860 --> 01:27:11,261
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, but there's always going to be one song on the mix.

1156
01:27:11,361 --> 01:27:14,202
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of like in Ultramix 2 there was La Cucaracha.

1157
01:27:14,362 --> 01:27:15,983
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, seriously, who the fuck plays that song?

1158
01:27:16,203 --> 01:27:18,944
[SPEAKER_15]: I want them to go to heaven, because I'm already going to hell.

1159
01:27:18,984 --> 01:27:19,745
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't want them there.

1160
01:27:19,765 --> 01:27:21,886
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, good point.

1161
01:27:23,366 --> 01:27:26,148
[SPEAKER_06]: On that note, is there anything else you wanted to share with our listeners, GS191?

1162
01:27:28,166 --> 01:27:28,786
[SPEAKER_18]: No, not really.

1163
01:27:29,567 --> 01:27:32,930
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, thanks for the call.

1164
01:27:33,690 --> 01:27:34,151
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, thank you.

1165
01:27:34,311 --> 01:27:36,393
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, and thanks for listening, and call back.

1166
01:27:36,453 --> 01:27:37,093
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't be a stranger.

1167
01:27:37,914 --> 01:27:38,174
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

1168
01:27:38,755 --> 01:27:39,115
[SPEAKER_06]: Take care.

1169
01:27:39,155 --> 01:27:39,335
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye.

1170
01:27:39,556 --> 01:27:39,816
[SPEAKER_06]: Later.

1171
01:27:41,137 --> 01:27:41,698
[SPEAKER_06]: One more call.

1172
01:27:41,758 --> 01:27:43,079
[SPEAKER_06]: We're just lighting up with calls tonight.

1173
01:27:43,099 --> 01:27:43,779
[SPEAKER_06]: This is crazy.

1174
01:27:44,420 --> 01:27:46,242
[SPEAKER_06]: Getting this new phone number was probably the best thing we ever did.

1175
01:27:46,362 --> 01:27:47,283
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.

1176
01:27:47,323 --> 01:27:50,786
[SPEAKER_22]: Hey, it's me, the legend, Zaku.

1177
01:27:51,046 --> 01:27:52,067
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, Zaku, what's up?

1178
01:27:53,206 --> 01:27:58,568
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, finally got to the phone after, you know, after trying to hammer Skype through, you know, through IPC.

1179
01:27:59,308 --> 01:28:02,410
[SPEAKER_06]: Zaku, I don't know what, Zaku, we've been hammered like all night long.

1180
01:28:02,450 --> 01:28:03,090
[SPEAKER_06]: It's crazy.

1181
01:28:03,170 --> 01:28:03,490
[SPEAKER_06]: What's up?

1182
01:28:04,530 --> 01:28:07,852
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, obviously you want my reaction to Captain Jack's death.

1183
01:28:07,872 --> 01:28:08,332
[SPEAKER_28]: Sure.

1184
01:28:08,632 --> 01:28:10,593
[SPEAKER_22]: It's a shame, it's a shame.

1185
01:28:10,613 --> 01:28:14,094
[SPEAKER_22]: I was, you know, I was pretty much shocked.

1186
01:28:14,955 --> 01:28:19,636
[SPEAKER_22]: As soon as I came home that night and found, you know, and just found out, good DDR freak.

1187
01:28:20,697 --> 01:28:20,997
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean...

1188
01:28:22,277 --> 01:28:30,147
[SPEAKER_22]: How, I mean, this pretty much hit us quickly, you know, I mean, all these events happen within a matter of a week.

1189
01:28:30,988 --> 01:28:38,898
[SPEAKER_22]: Monday he collapses and then a few days later he loses his life, he loses his battle to survive, so...

1190
01:28:40,484 --> 01:28:45,227
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm putting up a link right now in the chat room that I managed to find from a thread in Bomani Style about the US version of Beatmania.

1191
01:28:45,287 --> 01:28:46,487
[SPEAKER_06]: It involves EV games again.

1192
01:29:09,662 --> 01:29:14,304
[SPEAKER_22]: They managed to get the date right, but the pricing, you might want to take a look at.

1193
01:29:15,824 --> 01:29:19,605
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so Zaku posted a link in our chat room, which is available at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.

1194
01:29:19,665 --> 01:29:25,628
[SPEAKER_06]: Click on chat, and he wants me to take a look at this, and check out what's going on on EBGames.com.

1195
01:29:25,768 --> 01:29:26,148
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow!

1196
01:29:26,708 --> 01:29:31,410
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so they're going to ship Beatmania for the PS2, and it's saying March 1st, 2006.

1197
01:29:33,010 --> 01:29:34,150
[SPEAKER_06]: $49.99 is the price.

1198
01:29:34,210 --> 01:29:35,151
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's interesting, though, because...

1199
01:29:36,783 --> 01:29:41,050
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait a minute, $49.99 for the game and $49.99 for the bundle?

1200
01:29:41,872 --> 01:29:43,394
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, I was saying the same shit too.

1201
01:29:43,715 --> 01:29:48,964
[SPEAKER_22]: How come Konami, you know, I thought they were going to charge like $60 or $70 for that thing.

1202
01:29:50,029 --> 01:29:55,972
[SPEAKER_22]: Where they're pretty much shooting themselves in the foot when they're letting folks get away with a $50 ticket.

1203
01:29:55,992 --> 01:29:57,633
[SPEAKER_22]: Let me put it this way.

1204
01:30:18,283 --> 01:30:20,865
[SPEAKER_06]: The game's announced for January and February.

1205
01:30:20,905 --> 01:30:22,826
[SPEAKER_06]: We have about 24 of them.

1206
01:30:23,287 --> 01:30:25,108
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, March we have two.

1207
01:30:25,808 --> 01:30:27,409
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I'm going to tell you this much.

1208
01:30:27,890 --> 01:30:33,033
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't have any info when it's coming out yet because we haven't even gotten any info when that stuff's coming out, let alone other stuff.

1209
01:30:33,253 --> 01:30:36,255
[SPEAKER_06]: There's stuff getting announced left and right we have no dates for, so it doesn't matter.

1210
01:30:37,516 --> 01:30:40,198
[SPEAKER_06]: It is an interesting discovery, but I don't think it holds any weight.

1211
01:30:40,418 --> 01:30:41,599
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just like the date for Halo 3.

1212
01:30:41,779 --> 01:30:43,240
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, no one knows when that's coming out.

1213
01:30:43,260 --> 01:30:45,101
[SPEAKER_06]: They just put it on there saying take pre-orders.

1214
01:30:45,262 --> 01:30:45,642
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

1215
01:30:45,662 --> 01:30:45,862
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

1216
01:30:47,408 --> 01:31:02,998
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, but besides, well, besides that, you know, obviously, basically by the time I called you last night, you know, Digital Life was over, but I didn't manage to get the results of the last few tournaments.

1217
01:31:03,679 --> 01:31:05,460
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, what happened with the rest of Digital Life?

1218
01:31:06,360 --> 01:31:12,644
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, one of the, one of the, this cat I know, you know, who played DDR managed to win like, he managed to win two grand.

1219
01:31:13,925 --> 01:31:16,527
[SPEAKER_22]: One of the, one of the players from within, from within New York City.

1220
01:31:17,560 --> 01:31:21,101
[SPEAKER_22]: Very cool, congratulations.

1221
01:31:25,182 --> 01:31:31,824
[SPEAKER_22]: But so far, you know, Sunday was probably the worst day you went, and I know people learn their lessons well.

1222
01:31:32,725 --> 01:31:35,806
[SPEAKER_22]: The only good days are the ones that they have to, that they go freestyling.

1223
01:31:37,006 --> 01:31:38,006
[SPEAKER_22]: Keep that in mind, folks.

1224
01:31:38,787 --> 01:31:43,228
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, if I go to Digital Life next year, I'll keep that in mind, that Sunday is not the day for me to be there.

1225
01:31:43,288 --> 01:31:44,789
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll take my flight home on Sunday next year.

1226
01:31:44,809 --> 01:31:45,129
[SPEAKER_22]: You know,

1227
01:31:46,873 --> 01:31:48,334
[SPEAKER_22]: Next year is going to be four days.

1228
01:31:48,394 --> 01:31:54,096
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm assuming that the first day is going to be like a free play event and then the next three days is going to be the tournament.

1229
01:31:54,376 --> 01:31:57,437
[SPEAKER_06]: If I go to Digital Life next year, though, it ain't going to be just for the tournament.

1230
01:31:57,557 --> 01:31:58,498
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to take it all in.

1231
01:31:58,558 --> 01:32:00,639
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, of course I'll go to the tournament, but you know.

1232
01:32:01,879 --> 01:32:03,780
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, just make sure, now you know.

1233
01:32:04,280 --> 01:32:07,201
[SPEAKER_22]: Now you know that it's in the middle of October next year.

1234
01:32:07,382 --> 01:32:08,682
[SPEAKER_06]: And knowing is half the battle.

1235
01:32:09,562 --> 01:32:10,903
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, it's GDI, Joe.

1236
01:32:11,743 --> 01:32:13,604
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, anything else you want to share with our listeners, Zach?

1237
01:32:13,664 --> 01:32:15,705
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got to get to more calls because we've got people hammering us.

1238
01:32:16,569 --> 01:32:17,929
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, that's about it, man.

1239
01:32:18,049 --> 01:32:18,830
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

1240
01:32:20,270 --> 01:32:20,950
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, have a good one.

1241
01:32:21,390 --> 01:32:22,270
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for the call, Zaku.

1242
01:32:22,610 --> 01:32:23,291
[SPEAKER_08]: Goodbye.

1243
01:32:24,071 --> 01:32:24,551
[SPEAKER_08]: Later.

1244
01:32:26,591 --> 01:32:27,551
[SPEAKER_06]: We gotta get some more calls.

1245
01:32:28,472 --> 01:32:29,312
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange House Radio.

1246
01:32:30,392 --> 01:32:30,932
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, what's up?

1247
01:32:31,012 --> 01:32:33,833
[SPEAKER_06]: It's DJ Ranma S. Hello, DJ Ranma S. What's on your mind?

1248
01:32:34,553 --> 01:32:34,913
[SPEAKER_07]: Not much.

1249
01:32:34,933 --> 01:32:36,933
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanted to say a couple things about the captain.

1250
01:32:37,334 --> 01:32:39,274
[SPEAKER_06]: You cosplayed the captain, didn't you?

1251
01:32:40,214 --> 01:32:41,654
[SPEAKER_07]: No, but I'm planning on it.

1252
01:32:41,734 --> 01:32:43,975
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I thought you said you had cosplayed him at one point.

1253
01:32:44,443 --> 01:32:47,726
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I said I plan to hopefully maybe Captain Con next year.

1254
01:32:47,826 --> 01:32:48,267
[SPEAKER_06]: My bad.

1255
01:32:48,307 --> 01:32:48,707
[SPEAKER_06]: My bad.

1256
01:32:49,668 --> 01:32:53,672
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, prepare to be surrounded by white women because that's what happens with Captain Jack.

1257
01:32:53,892 --> 01:32:54,472
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, I love it.

1258
01:32:55,093 --> 01:32:55,473
[SPEAKER_06]: I love it.

1259
01:32:57,523 --> 01:33:02,326
[SPEAKER_26]: Which is why he told me on... Oh, never mind, I'm not exactly a white animal.

1260
01:33:02,346 --> 01:33:04,508
[SPEAKER_26]: Close enough, close enough.

1261
01:33:04,648 --> 01:33:05,549
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, it doesn't matter.

1262
01:33:06,109 --> 01:33:09,351
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously, we're just kidding, you know, joking around when we say stuff like that.

1263
01:33:09,531 --> 01:33:12,053
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously, you know, it's all about people.

1264
01:33:12,073 --> 01:33:12,513
[SPEAKER_06]: Hot bitches.

1265
01:33:12,934 --> 01:33:13,294
[SPEAKER_06]: People.

1266
01:33:13,434 --> 01:33:14,655
[SPEAKER_06]: Hot bitches of all types.

1267
01:33:15,475 --> 01:33:19,178
[SPEAKER_26]: Actually, when he told me, I thought, you know, I was like,

1268
01:33:19,761 --> 01:33:21,302
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you for telling me, I appreciate that

1269
01:33:46,480 --> 01:33:46,920
[SPEAKER_06]: No problem.

1270
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,801
[SPEAKER_07]: So anything else you want to share about the whole Captain Jack thing?

1271
01:33:50,361 --> 01:33:51,302
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, a couple things.

1272
01:33:52,802 --> 01:34:02,666
[SPEAKER_07]: One thing, Captain Jack, it means a lot to me because at An Amazement, I did a walk on as Naval Barrett to End the Navy, which is one of my personal favorite songs.

1273
01:34:03,786 --> 01:34:05,967
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, it kind of,

1274
01:34:06,394 --> 01:34:07,194
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1275
01:34:19,506 --> 01:34:26,850
[SPEAKER_06]: The circumstance and the fact that he was just a fun party guy and died at a young age just kind of makes you go, life sucks.

1276
01:34:27,210 --> 01:34:27,810
[SPEAKER_06]: Life sucks.

1277
01:34:28,711 --> 01:34:35,834
[SPEAKER_15]: I was just going to say, everybody that calls in, they have a memory of some song that they've heard before.

1278
01:34:36,715 --> 01:34:41,857
[SPEAKER_15]: That obviously this guy was a strong presence for you all when you guys started getting into DDR.

1279
01:34:42,178 --> 01:34:42,998
[SPEAKER_15]: So that is sad.

1280
01:34:43,778 --> 01:34:46,720
[SPEAKER_15]: Wow, you said something profound on this show.

1281
01:34:46,760 --> 01:34:47,080
[SPEAKER_06]: I did.

1282
01:34:47,180 --> 01:34:48,020
[SPEAKER_06]: I can be profound.

1283
01:34:48,040 --> 01:34:48,661
[SPEAKER_06]: Holy fuck!

1284
01:34:49,912 --> 01:34:51,373
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody note the date and time.

1285
01:34:51,513 --> 01:34:52,754
[SPEAKER_06]: No, you're absolutely right.

1286
01:34:52,874 --> 01:34:54,696
[SPEAKER_06]: Someone stop the presses.

1287
01:34:55,256 --> 01:35:00,720
[SPEAKER_06]: Because Captain Jack is so, he's got such a strong personality and his songs are very unique.

1288
01:35:01,200 --> 01:35:05,604
[SPEAKER_06]: Like him or not, you know a Captain Jack song when you hear it because it sounds like somebody's barking orders at you.

1289
01:35:06,004 --> 01:35:11,288
[SPEAKER_06]: And people remember that with DDR and people have such fond memories about DDR and playing DDR with their friends.

1290
01:35:11,528 --> 01:35:14,791
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of like how I was saying in the opening of the show when, you know, only you.

1291
01:35:15,191 --> 01:35:17,533
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody would get down and, you know, throw all your hands up.

1292
01:35:17,553 --> 01:35:18,053
[SPEAKER_06]: Hands up.

1293
01:35:18,093 --> 01:35:18,994
[SPEAKER_06]: And everybody would do it.

1294
01:35:19,054 --> 01:35:19,314
[SPEAKER_06]: And like,

1295
01:35:19,674 --> 01:35:19,875
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1296
01:35:37,059 --> 01:35:37,539
[SPEAKER_06]: You're welcome.

1297
01:35:38,159 --> 01:35:39,540
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, Ranma, I didn't mean to.

1298
01:35:39,560 --> 01:35:39,860
[SPEAKER_06]: It's okay.

1299
01:35:40,560 --> 01:35:41,440
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything else you want to share?

1300
01:35:42,041 --> 01:35:43,521
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, two things before I go.

1301
01:35:43,601 --> 01:35:43,921
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

1302
01:35:43,941 --> 01:35:47,502
[SPEAKER_07]: Another reason why Captain Jack needs something to me, I want to post this link.

1303
01:35:47,882 --> 01:35:53,504
[SPEAKER_07]: Someone, YTMND, as Sailor Barrett, and if you click on it, you hear In the Navy.

1304
01:35:54,604 --> 01:35:57,005
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm afraid to bring that up because YTMND... It's a good one.

1305
01:35:57,165 --> 01:35:58,405
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a good one, seriously.

1306
01:35:58,485 --> 01:36:03,307
[SPEAKER_06]: But my computer doesn't like YTMND, so I don't know if I can pull it up, but chat room, go for it.

1307
01:36:04,634 --> 01:36:08,896
[SPEAKER_07]: and right here, standing in front of my computer, I have a can of Budweiser.

1308
01:36:09,196 --> 01:36:10,496
[SPEAKER_07]: Crack one open for the captain.

1309
01:36:12,197 --> 01:36:13,457
[SPEAKER_05]: Pour a 40 for me.

1310
01:36:15,278 --> 01:36:16,638
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn, I'm not that ghetto, son.

1311
01:36:19,519 --> 01:36:19,919
[SPEAKER_07]: I am.

1312
01:36:19,939 --> 01:36:25,381
[SPEAKER_07]: A whiff is like that, but you're going to have a good old time at CatDew.

1313
01:36:25,901 --> 01:36:27,142
[SPEAKER_06]: Hell yeah, hell yeah.

1314
01:36:27,182 --> 01:36:28,602
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe I should cosplay as the captain.

1315
01:36:30,063 --> 01:36:30,163
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

1316
01:36:33,250 --> 01:36:34,531
[SPEAKER_07]: I know some single gay guys.

1317
01:36:51,670 --> 01:36:52,250
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm just kidding.

1318
01:36:52,310 --> 01:36:52,991
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, let's get to it.

1319
01:36:53,912 --> 01:36:54,512
[SPEAKER_06]: One more call.

1320
01:36:54,552 --> 01:36:58,595
[SPEAKER_06]: I keep saying that, but I keep seeing all these names that have been hammering us.

1321
01:36:58,895 --> 01:36:59,115
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

1322
01:36:59,355 --> 01:37:06,040
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been seeing all these names hammering us all night long, and I know that people want to say stuff about the captain, so I feel an obligation to get to all these calls.

1323
01:37:06,340 --> 01:37:07,701
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is the last one for now.

1324
01:37:08,141 --> 01:37:09,082
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Arizona Radio.

1325
01:37:11,123 --> 01:37:11,944
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, wow, I'm the last one?

1326
01:37:11,984 --> 01:37:12,785
[SPEAKER_14]: I feel privileged.

1327
01:37:12,825 --> 01:37:13,865
[SPEAKER_14]: It's SSJ100 Matt.

1328
01:37:13,885 --> 01:37:18,469
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I see you've been hammering us for like 30 minutes, so I feel bad for you, so I wanted to let you through.

1329
01:37:18,529 --> 01:37:18,889
[SPEAKER_06]: What's up?

1330
01:37:19,673 --> 01:37:20,553
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm pretty pathetic.

1331
01:37:21,754 --> 01:37:22,374
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all good.

1332
01:37:22,474 --> 01:37:23,074
[SPEAKER_06]: We appreciate it.

1333
01:37:24,535 --> 01:37:24,995
[SPEAKER_14]: No, nothing.

1334
01:37:25,035 --> 01:37:29,217
[SPEAKER_14]: I just found out the bad news by Captain Jack after coming back from seeing Doom.

1335
01:37:29,697 --> 01:37:31,098
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's two bad things in a row.

1336
01:37:32,058 --> 01:37:33,279
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, shit.

1337
01:37:33,299 --> 01:37:35,280
[SPEAKER_06]: You know things come in threes, too.

1338
01:37:35,460 --> 01:37:36,720
[SPEAKER_06]: So brace yourself.

1339
01:37:36,760 --> 01:37:38,421
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you're listening to this program, I suppose.

1340
01:37:38,521 --> 01:37:39,661
[SPEAKER_06]: And warts.

1341
01:37:39,782 --> 01:37:40,082
[SPEAKER_15]: Who knows?

1342
01:37:45,789 --> 01:37:48,932
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't have sex in the next 24 hours, because you're bound to catch something.

1343
01:37:49,273 --> 01:37:51,915
[SPEAKER_06]: Because bad things come in threes, so be careful.

1344
01:37:52,876 --> 01:37:59,183
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I'm about to go play the new Budokai Tenkaichi with my roommate after this.

1345
01:37:59,583 --> 01:38:00,764
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to blow up your console.

1346
01:38:01,745 --> 01:38:02,746
[SPEAKER_14]: Or I'll get raped.

1347
01:38:06,570 --> 01:38:06,970
[SPEAKER_06]: Either way.

1348
01:38:07,010 --> 01:38:08,292
[SPEAKER_06]: What are your thoughts on Captain Jack?

1349
01:38:12,246 --> 01:38:13,429
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just disappointed.

1350
01:38:13,450 --> 01:38:18,303
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not going to hear any new songs from anymore on any of the new DDRs.

1351
01:38:20,370 --> 01:38:20,771
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

1352
01:38:21,391 --> 01:38:24,474
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe he's like Tupac and he has a bunch of songs that haven't been released.

1353
01:38:24,754 --> 01:38:25,615
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you never know.

1354
01:38:26,756 --> 01:38:27,797
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe he's still alive somewhere.

1355
01:38:27,837 --> 01:38:30,120
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe the whole damn thing is a conspiracy.

1356
01:38:30,880 --> 01:38:31,921
[SPEAKER_15]: They'll find him in Mexico.

1357
01:38:33,082 --> 01:38:34,764
[SPEAKER_15]: Mexico, Canada.

1358
01:38:34,984 --> 01:38:37,126
[SPEAKER_06]: I can see the hate mail coming in right now.

1359
01:38:37,146 --> 01:38:38,287
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything else on your mind?

1360
01:38:42,312 --> 01:38:45,315
[SPEAKER_06]: Nope, other than Doom was a disappointment.

1361
01:38:47,036 --> 01:38:50,158
[SPEAKER_06]: Was that first person stuff as stupid as it looked in the preview?

1362
01:38:51,099 --> 01:38:58,023
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, to tell you the truth, they only really had it for about two to five minutes of the last part of the movie.

1363
01:38:58,043 --> 01:38:58,364
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

1364
01:38:58,644 --> 01:39:00,385
[SPEAKER_06]: That still seems like a long time.

1365
01:39:00,465 --> 01:39:02,346
[SPEAKER_06]: Five minutes is a goddamn long time.

1366
01:39:02,667 --> 01:39:06,489
[SPEAKER_15]: Seriously, though, the way that they hyped it up, it was supposed to be like the big thing in the movie.

1367
01:39:06,509 --> 01:39:08,631
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, thank God, because that shit looked cheesy.

1368
01:39:09,716 --> 01:39:11,998
[SPEAKER_15]: It did, but you know... Yeah, it was cheesy.

1369
01:39:12,739 --> 01:39:19,364
[SPEAKER_06]: And they did not have... Somebody in chat, I don't know if it was you or somebody else, I just saw it fly by in the chat room earlier, said that the flying eyeballs are not in the movie.

1370
01:39:20,305 --> 01:39:21,606
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah, I said that.

1371
01:39:21,626 --> 01:39:22,506
[SPEAKER_14]: That's bullshit.

1372
01:39:23,207 --> 01:39:29,052
[SPEAKER_14]: I was expecting like flaming skulls and skeletons with rocket launchers on their shoulders, but...

1373
01:39:29,602 --> 01:39:34,886
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it was Roger Ebert that said that the best thing in the film was, like, the beginning Universal logo.

1374
01:39:35,287 --> 01:39:37,428
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, there was some big thing that they did at the beginning.

1375
01:39:37,829 --> 01:39:40,111
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, was that the best thing in the film?

1376
01:39:43,633 --> 01:39:47,637
[SPEAKER_14]: No, you know, they had a couple subtle things in the movie.

1377
01:39:49,015 --> 01:39:52,857
[SPEAKER_06]: The best thing about Doom will probably be the trailer for Harry Potter beforehand.

1378
01:39:52,877 --> 01:39:53,697
[SPEAKER_06]: Harry Potter, oh my god.

1379
01:39:54,158 --> 01:39:54,498
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay.

1380
01:39:55,058 --> 01:39:55,378
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

1381
01:39:56,499 --> 01:39:56,859
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

1382
01:39:57,839 --> 01:40:02,822
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, Matt, we gotta go because we gotta get to a break here because we're tired and we've been taking calls for like the past hour.

1383
01:40:02,942 --> 01:40:03,562
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1384
01:40:03,822 --> 01:40:04,523
[SPEAKER_06]: But have a good one.

1385
01:40:04,543 --> 01:40:05,483
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for calling in, okay?

1386
01:40:06,343 --> 01:40:06,964
[SPEAKER_06]: Peace out, man.

1387
01:40:06,984 --> 01:40:07,504
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, later.

1388
01:40:07,984 --> 01:40:08,665
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep, bye.

1389
01:40:09,285 --> 01:40:09,485
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye.

1390
01:40:11,445 --> 01:40:12,665
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you guys for calling in.

1391
01:40:12,966 --> 01:40:14,066
[SPEAKER_06]: Whole shitload of calls tonight.

1392
01:40:14,086 --> 01:40:14,706
[SPEAKER_06]: We appreciate it.

1393
01:40:14,746 --> 01:40:15,527
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry to those of you guys.

1394
01:40:15,567 --> 01:40:17,207
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope we got to everybody at least once.

1395
01:40:17,287 --> 01:40:19,648
[SPEAKER_06]: I really, really apologize to those of you guys we didn't get to.

1396
01:40:20,348 --> 01:40:21,429
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll get to you guys a little bit later.

1397
01:40:21,829 --> 01:40:22,729
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully, if we have time.

1398
01:40:23,209 --> 01:40:24,890
[SPEAKER_06]: And try not to kill yourself on the way out, Xtfer.

1399
01:40:26,511 --> 01:40:27,211
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, anyway.

1400
01:40:28,391 --> 01:40:29,212
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go to a break.

1401
01:40:29,312 --> 01:40:30,052
[SPEAKER_06]: Damn, I need a break.

1402
01:40:30,072 --> 01:40:32,293
[SPEAKER_06]: And I promised somebody we could hear Little Boy.

1403
01:40:32,973 --> 01:40:35,294
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're going to play that song from DDR Max 2.

1404
01:40:37,373 --> 01:40:42,017
[SPEAKER_06]: And when we come back, we will probably get into the cage match and talk about some other stuff as well.

1405
01:40:42,857 --> 01:40:44,639
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's go to a break.

1406
01:40:44,879 --> 01:40:47,581
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that microphone is being awful.

1407
01:40:50,703 --> 01:40:52,505
[SPEAKER_15]: It was left on for some reason.

1408
01:40:53,185 --> 01:40:53,425
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1409
01:40:54,606 --> 01:40:55,347
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to play this.

1410
01:40:55,427 --> 01:40:57,248
[SPEAKER_06]: It's actually the full version of Little Boy.

1411
01:40:57,288 --> 01:41:00,571
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll play that and a couple other little Captain Jack songs, and we'll be back after this.

1412
01:41:05,993 --> 01:41:11,355
[SPEAKER_10]: Dream on my little boy, dream on my little boy, dream on my little boy, go out and have some joy.

1413
01:41:57,463 --> 01:41:59,492
[SPEAKER_10]: Dream on my little boy, dream on my little boy

1414
01:42:46,857 --> 01:42:58,648
[SPEAKER_10]: Dream on my little boy, dream on my little boy, dream on my little boy, go out and have some joy Little boy, dream on my little boy, dream on my little boy, go out and have some joy

1415
01:43:17,746 --> 01:43:21,648
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, little boy, do you think you're Mr. Right?

1416
01:43:21,688 --> 01:43:28,832
[SPEAKER_10]: A girl like me still wants to choose the man, the only one she wants to be Realize reality, you're not Mr. Right Running on that one big street alone

1417
01:43:51,295 --> 01:43:51,496
Cool!

1418
01:44:15,538 --> 01:44:17,079
Thanks for watching!

1419
01:48:21,318 --> 01:48:22,200
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

1420
01:48:35,768 --> 01:48:44,331
[SPEAKER_29]: Hi-ho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter V, the letter A, and the number 59.

1421
01:48:44,371 --> 01:48:50,494
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

1422
01:48:50,574 --> 01:48:51,354
[SPEAKER_06]: Listen, Frog!

1423
01:48:52,495 --> 01:48:53,335
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi-yo!

1424
01:48:54,595 --> 01:48:55,236
[SPEAKER_06]: I love the Muppets.

1425
01:48:55,836 --> 01:48:58,557
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, anyway, we're back on Orange Lounge Radio.

1426
01:48:59,983 --> 01:49:08,733
[SPEAKER_06]: In that break, you heard Captain Jack with Little Boy, the original, and oh my gosh, the chat room freaked out because I wasn't playing the remix that's in DDR, and it was the original.

1427
01:49:09,754 --> 01:49:12,558
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, it gives you guys a chance to hear maybe something you haven't heard before.

1428
01:49:13,018 --> 01:49:13,499
[SPEAKER_06]: Imagine that.

1429
01:49:13,879 --> 01:49:19,526
[SPEAKER_06]: Aiko Aiko from DanceMania21, and Dancing Pompokolin from DDR Fifth Mix.

1430
01:49:20,489 --> 01:49:20,949
[SPEAKER_06]: Good times.

1431
01:49:21,189 --> 01:49:26,172
[SPEAKER_06]: And did you notice, Extifer, I'm sure you noticed this, the lyrics in Ico Ico, did you hear Set Your Fag on Fire?

1432
01:49:26,252 --> 01:49:26,532
[SPEAKER_06]: I did.

1433
01:49:26,692 --> 01:49:27,973
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you pointed it out.

1434
01:49:28,013 --> 01:49:32,455
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, at Captain Jack's request, we will be setting Extifer on fire at the end of the show.

1435
01:49:34,476 --> 01:49:35,456
[SPEAKER_06]: How funny.

1436
01:49:35,476 --> 01:49:36,657
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to set our fag on fire.

1437
01:49:36,677 --> 01:49:39,498
[SPEAKER_06]: Take you with me, bitch.

1438
01:49:43,981 --> 01:49:45,241
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to go over to Loki.

1439
01:49:45,321 --> 01:49:46,542
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki's actually got some...

1440
01:49:49,565 --> 01:49:59,289
[SPEAKER_06]: I was looking for that, because I don't see it.

1441
01:50:00,269 --> 01:50:01,770
[SPEAKER_06]: It was there, but it's gone.

1442
01:50:03,150 --> 01:50:12,854
[SPEAKER_06]: No, someone, of course, making games for the PSP, and the one that they had on there, which I can't find for the life of me, is called Button Mash Revolution.

1443
01:50:14,375 --> 01:50:14,455
[SPEAKER_06]: It

1444
01:50:16,207 --> 01:50:18,468
[SPEAKER_06]: Like DDR, but, you know, not.

1445
01:50:20,968 --> 01:50:24,189
[SPEAKER_06]: And I can't find any info on it because the fucking links are gone.

1446
01:50:24,309 --> 01:50:33,251
[SPEAKER_06]: So, fuck them for updating their stupid website and not having, like most websites do, you know, news archive where you can go to the next page and next page and next page.

1447
01:50:33,891 --> 01:50:36,292
[SPEAKER_06]: No, we're too good for that.

1448
01:50:37,212 --> 01:50:38,432
[SPEAKER_06]: So, fucking A, but...

1449
01:50:39,963 --> 01:50:41,266
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it was really cool looking.

1450
01:50:41,948 --> 01:50:46,458
[SPEAKER_06]: I wish I could talk more about it, but I can't find the goddamn link, so... Yay!

1451
01:50:48,154 --> 01:50:49,635
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll go from here.

1452
01:50:49,675 --> 01:50:50,756
[SPEAKER_06]: Live radio, boys and girls.

1453
01:50:51,736 --> 01:50:53,437
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, I got Bomani-related news.

1454
01:50:53,557 --> 01:50:54,138
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead.

1455
01:50:54,238 --> 01:50:58,280
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I just remembered this, because something that was just said in the chat room reminded me of this.

1456
01:50:58,701 --> 01:51:02,603
[SPEAKER_06]: You know they showed a little preview of the new Madonna video for Hung Up?

1457
01:51:03,484 --> 01:51:09,187
[SPEAKER_06]: The super gay, gay, gay, gay, gay, gay song that's coming out very soon.

1458
01:51:09,588 --> 01:51:13,890
[SPEAKER_06]: They showed a little preview of the video on Total Request Live, and somebody put it on the internet.

1459
01:51:13,910 --> 01:51:14,471
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, get this.

1460
01:51:15,191 --> 01:51:16,612
[SPEAKER_06]: Freaking DDRs in the video.

1461
01:51:16,632 --> 01:51:20,633
[SPEAKER_06]: Should I show this in the little... I'll even post this link in the chat room.

1462
01:51:21,593 --> 01:51:34,298
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to post the link to the little video clip that they have, and I'll play it in the studio, see what you guys think here about this clip of Hung Up, which actually, I guess it's not really DDR, but it's actually Dancing Stage Fusion, but, you know, DDR.

1463
01:51:34,318 --> 01:51:34,918
[SPEAKER_06]: It's still DDR.

1464
01:51:35,899 --> 01:51:37,039
[SPEAKER_06]: It's DDR under a different name.

1465
01:51:37,319 --> 01:51:39,040
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, Madonna, she's got to be so British.

1466
01:51:42,162 --> 01:51:42,743
[SPEAKER_06]: Madonna's New...

1467
01:52:05,781 --> 01:52:10,306
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got a video, and I can't play it in Firefox.

1468
01:52:10,426 --> 01:52:17,913
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to open up Internet Explorer because Firefox won't play that clip, but I want to play it for you guys in studio.

1469
01:52:19,935 --> 01:52:20,596
[SPEAKER_06]: And here we go.

1470
01:52:20,856 --> 01:52:23,018
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, that's posted in our chat room at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.

1471
01:52:23,038 --> 01:52:25,861
[SPEAKER_06]: Click on chat, and here it is for us in studio.

1472
01:52:47,049 --> 01:52:51,753
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so you can see, like, what was Madonna doing at the end of the clip there?

1473
01:52:51,813 --> 01:52:55,156
[SPEAKER_06]: She's like doing that rolling in the dough thing on the DDR machine.

1474
01:52:55,196 --> 01:52:59,720
[SPEAKER_06]: She's really getting down on that machine, and she's kind of surrounded by her dancers, so...

1475
01:53:00,967 --> 01:53:03,970
[SPEAKER_06]: DDR is making it into the mainstream, that's for sure.

1476
01:53:03,990 --> 01:53:04,951
[SPEAKER_15]: Madonna bugs me.

1477
01:53:05,973 --> 01:53:06,593
[SPEAKER_15]: And you're gay!

1478
01:53:06,834 --> 01:53:07,855
[SPEAKER_15]: I know, I can't stand it.

1479
01:53:07,895 --> 01:53:12,600
[SPEAKER_15]: I've never really liked her, except for with the exception of her Oh Father video.

1480
01:53:13,301 --> 01:53:17,766
[SPEAKER_15]: But, I don't know, just something about her, she's just pretentious.

1481
01:53:17,826 --> 01:53:20,189
[SPEAKER_15]: So has DDR officially jumped the shark with this or something?

1482
01:53:20,209 --> 01:53:20,349
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

1483
01:53:21,649 --> 01:53:22,069
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

1484
01:53:22,149 --> 01:53:23,850
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, I can't stand the song.

1485
01:53:24,150 --> 01:53:26,171
[SPEAKER_15]: I think the song absolutely sucks.

1486
01:53:26,811 --> 01:53:30,392
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what you said when I played it the other day.

1487
01:53:30,752 --> 01:53:32,653
[SPEAKER_15]: I did not say that I liked that song.

1488
01:53:32,813 --> 01:53:34,713
[SPEAKER_06]: He didn't say you liked it, but he said it wasn't that bad.

1489
01:53:35,753 --> 01:53:37,694
[SPEAKER_15]: I didn't say anything about it, I don't think.

1490
01:53:39,094 --> 01:53:40,635
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't even like the ABBA original.

1491
01:53:41,875 --> 01:53:43,636
[SPEAKER_15]: Everybody hating me now because I just said that.

1492
01:53:43,656 --> 01:53:43,916
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I don't.

1493
01:53:44,456 --> 01:53:44,996
[SPEAKER_15]: It's fine.

1494
01:53:46,957 --> 01:53:47,237
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1495
01:53:47,457 --> 01:53:48,537
[SPEAKER_06]: But DDR in the video?

1496
01:53:49,098 --> 01:53:50,158
[SPEAKER_06]: Good thing or bad thing for DDR?

1497
01:53:51,345 --> 01:53:52,586
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, that's cool and everything.

1498
01:53:52,626 --> 01:53:54,347
[SPEAKER_15]: Madonna, obviously, is huge.

1499
01:53:55,607 --> 01:54:01,491
[SPEAKER_15]: By her having the video game in her video, that's a big deal.

1500
01:54:02,311 --> 01:54:04,873
[SPEAKER_15]: But, you know, just me, a personal thing, I don't like her.

1501
01:54:05,853 --> 01:54:06,253
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1502
01:54:07,694 --> 01:54:10,436
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think, Loki, as a straight guy...

1503
01:54:12,335 --> 01:54:18,439
[SPEAKER_06]: who, you know, as this Madonna doing an ABBA thing must be very, very, very gay.

1504
01:54:18,779 --> 01:54:21,421
[SPEAKER_06]: And now to see DDR in the video makes it gay-y gay.

1505
01:54:22,181 --> 01:54:22,662
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think?

1506
01:54:23,282 --> 01:54:35,230
[SPEAKER_06]: I think she's just trying to, you know, throw as much pop culture references in there, you know, to... She's insane, just like, you know, frickin' Tom Cruise, okay?

1507
01:54:35,490 --> 01:54:38,512
[SPEAKER_06]: They're all lumped together, frickin' crazy-ass people.

1508
01:54:38,905 --> 01:54:39,445
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

1509
01:54:39,746 --> 01:54:44,309
[SPEAKER_06]: The last thing I'd be doing once I got lots of money would be going insane.

1510
01:54:46,210 --> 01:54:48,371
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, hmm, I have lots of money to buy stuff.

1511
01:54:48,451 --> 01:54:50,072
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I think I'll go insane instead.

1512
01:54:50,212 --> 01:54:51,353
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's just denounce everything.

1513
01:54:51,433 --> 01:54:53,635
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's be as whacked out crazy as possible.

1514
01:54:53,655 --> 01:54:57,837
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's become Jewish, and then Catholic, and then Jewish, and then Catholic, and then Jewish, and then Catholic.

1515
01:54:58,318 --> 01:54:59,078
[SPEAKER_15]: And then Kambala.

1516
01:55:00,139 --> 01:55:00,959
[SPEAKER_15]: And Scientologist.

1517
01:55:01,840 --> 01:55:04,442
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so, you know, Esther can go fuck my ass.

1518
01:55:06,083 --> 01:55:06,823
[SPEAKER_06]: Stupid Esther.

1519
01:55:07,544 --> 01:55:07,804
[SPEAKER_06]: Esther!

1520
01:55:08,671 --> 01:55:09,692
[SPEAKER_06]: I like Madonna.

1521
01:55:09,792 --> 01:55:12,493
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't like Ugo over Madonna, but, you know, she's cool.

1522
01:55:12,573 --> 01:55:13,553
[SPEAKER_06]: I respect what she's doing.

1523
01:55:13,713 --> 01:55:15,194
[SPEAKER_06]: No, you mean Esther.

1524
01:55:15,214 --> 01:55:20,716
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you've got to respect Madonna's freestyle, though, in the video, because she's looking away from the screen.

1525
01:55:21,136 --> 01:55:22,317
[SPEAKER_06]: So I give her points for that.

1526
01:55:22,357 --> 01:55:27,319
[SPEAKER_06]: And somebody in the chatroom says, OMG, Madonna is AAA-ing Paranoia, Survivor, Max, Oni, S4R.

1527
01:55:29,400 --> 01:55:30,120
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys are nerds.

1528
01:55:30,320 --> 01:55:32,021
[SPEAKER_06]: And making a music video at the same time.

1529
01:55:32,421 --> 01:55:35,542
[SPEAKER_06]: Angel, DDR in a Madonna video.

1530
01:55:35,842 --> 01:55:37,223
[SPEAKER_06]: Good for DDR or bad news?

1531
01:55:40,963 --> 01:55:41,823
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't know.

1532
01:55:42,343 --> 01:55:45,404
[SPEAKER_26]: I guess it's okay, but it's Madonna.

1533
01:55:48,986 --> 01:55:49,226
[SPEAKER_26]: No.

1534
01:55:52,927 --> 01:55:55,008
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody heard that.

1535
01:55:55,128 --> 01:55:58,470
[SPEAKER_15]: I just said she should have done Like A Virgin.

1536
01:55:58,510 --> 01:56:04,692
[SPEAKER_15]: If she's going to do a DDR video, she should have done a live version of her Like A Virgin where she humped the stage.

1537
01:56:05,412 --> 01:56:06,573
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, the dancing stage.

1538
01:56:08,760 --> 01:56:14,764
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, and on that note, Sky... Loki, do you have anything else going on in the DDR world you want to share?

1539
01:56:15,004 --> 01:56:17,506
[SPEAKER_06]: Didn't the new website open up or something, speaking of gay?

1540
01:56:20,808 --> 01:56:30,735
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, the Ultramix 3 website was launched, and they changed the freaking logo on us to something that's super-duper gaytastic.

1541
01:56:31,135 --> 01:56:32,236
[SPEAKER_06]: So what's the logo look like now?

1542
01:56:32,696 --> 01:56:37,239
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, let me just pull it up for you, since that's what I do nowadays.

1543
01:56:40,655 --> 01:56:43,456
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, what I'll do... It's really bad.

1544
01:56:43,656 --> 01:56:49,237
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically, it's kind of this party theme with a giant friggin' rainbow going through it.

1545
01:56:50,458 --> 01:56:54,779
[SPEAKER_06]: So, um... Yeah, basically... Here it is, right here.

1546
01:56:55,039 --> 01:56:55,299
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1547
01:56:57,220 --> 01:56:57,680
[SPEAKER_06]: Be afraid.

1548
01:56:59,060 --> 01:57:02,441
[SPEAKER_06]: It's giant rainbow-ass revolution... It's rainbow-tastic.

1549
01:57:02,461 --> 01:57:05,422
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, Emmy's got her outfit from the graduation video.

1550
01:57:05,762 --> 01:57:08,303
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll make a lot of fanboys happy because that skirt is very short.

1551
01:57:08,814 --> 01:57:10,416
[SPEAKER_06]: Slut Emmy would have been better.

1552
01:57:10,796 --> 01:57:12,397
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyways, there it is.

1553
01:57:12,678 --> 01:57:17,202
[SPEAKER_06]: Ultramix 3 with its stupid rainbow-tastic stuff.

1554
01:57:18,463 --> 01:57:18,684
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1555
01:57:20,025 --> 01:57:20,465
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

1556
01:57:22,727 --> 01:57:23,809
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was really lame.

1557
01:57:24,009 --> 01:57:33,318
[SPEAKER_06]: But they did have, there's some screenshots on there which, you know, sort of, you know, that's where we got all the, you know, new songs that were coming out and stuff.

1558
01:57:34,011 --> 01:57:35,532
[SPEAKER_06]: Hung up by Madonna to match the theme, you think?

1559
01:57:35,552 --> 01:57:38,513
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe a secret license in Ultramix 3?

1560
01:57:38,553 --> 01:57:40,974
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know about that, but...

1561
01:58:03,826 --> 01:58:08,369
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let's get into the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match tonight, shall we boys and girls?

1562
01:58:08,930 --> 01:58:09,730
[SPEAKER_06]: It is about that time.

1563
01:58:12,132 --> 01:58:15,274
[SPEAKER_06]: The way the Cage Match works, as a reminder, we're going to play three songs for you guys.

1564
01:58:15,314 --> 01:58:18,857
[SPEAKER_06]: You kids get to vote for your favorite song, but you have to be in the chat room to vote.

1565
01:58:19,697 --> 01:58:21,679
[SPEAKER_06]: You do, or else you're going to lose.

1566
01:58:22,952 --> 01:58:25,134
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, so we're going to do the chat room tonight.

1567
01:58:25,174 --> 01:58:27,196
[SPEAKER_06]: Three songs in the cage match.

1568
01:58:27,236 --> 01:58:31,800
[SPEAKER_06]: You only get to hear a clip of last week's winner, though, because you already heard it last week.

1569
01:58:31,840 --> 01:58:35,002
[SPEAKER_06]: And it actually won two weeks in a row now, so it's going for its third win.

1570
01:58:35,463 --> 01:58:39,526
[SPEAKER_06]: The group is called Pendulum, and the song is called Hold Your Color.

1571
01:58:39,907 --> 01:58:42,209
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's song number one you can vote for in tonight's cage match.

1572
01:58:42,249 --> 01:58:42,729
[SPEAKER_06]: So get ready.

1573
01:58:42,769 --> 01:58:45,872
[SPEAKER_06]: Here comes the clip of song number one, Pendulum with Hold Your Color.

1574
01:58:52,749 --> 01:58:54,611
When they take everything away

1575
02:01:22,393 --> 02:01:24,235
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, that was song number one.

1576
02:01:25,416 --> 02:01:27,998
[SPEAKER_06]: Last week's winner, Pendulum with Hold Your Color.

1577
02:01:28,539 --> 02:01:34,464
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, we're going to get into song number two tonight, and song number two comes to us courtesy of Loki.

1578
02:01:35,045 --> 02:01:36,666
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, what did you pick for us tonight?

1579
02:01:37,927 --> 02:01:42,792
[SPEAKER_06]: I picked, as I promised last week, I picked Pendulum again.

1580
02:01:46,104 --> 02:01:47,646
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no rules about this.

1581
02:01:48,247 --> 02:01:50,269
[SPEAKER_06]: This is Slam by Pendulum.

1582
02:01:50,409 --> 02:01:53,793
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to edit in the intro, but then I realized that the song would be too long.

1583
02:01:54,333 --> 02:02:00,200
[SPEAKER_06]: As a reminder, last week, Loki was pissed that Pendulum won, so he decided to put another Pendulum song in.

1584
02:02:00,660 --> 02:02:02,983
[SPEAKER_06]: It lost, so he's doing it again.

1585
02:02:05,045 --> 02:02:05,206
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

1586
02:02:06,397 --> 02:02:07,138
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to make a rule.

1587
02:02:07,158 --> 02:02:07,818
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to make a rule.

1588
02:02:07,838 --> 02:02:10,080
[SPEAKER_06]: Jamie and I are going to get together and make a rule and outvote your ass.

1589
02:02:10,240 --> 02:02:12,802
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, no more Pendulum and Cage Match ever or something.

1590
02:02:12,822 --> 02:02:14,683
[SPEAKER_06]: And then Shane will be mad at you because it'll be your fault.

1591
02:02:14,703 --> 02:02:15,864
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not going to be my fault.

1592
02:02:15,904 --> 02:02:16,625
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be your fault.

1593
02:02:17,445 --> 02:02:17,885
[SPEAKER_06]: That's fine.

1594
02:02:17,926 --> 02:02:19,847
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll just put other... I'll put girls in again.

1595
02:02:19,987 --> 02:02:20,547
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, shit.

1596
02:02:20,607 --> 02:02:20,988
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

1597
02:02:22,409 --> 02:02:22,869
[SPEAKER_06]: Here it is.

1598
02:02:22,969 --> 02:02:24,610
[SPEAKER_06]: Song number two in tonight's Cage Match.

1599
02:02:24,690 --> 02:02:26,412
[SPEAKER_06]: Pendulum with Slam.

1600
02:03:24,956 --> 02:03:25,860
[SPEAKER_01]: on this small place.

1601
02:05:50,734 --> 02:05:59,345
[SPEAKER_01]: were marooned on a small island in an endless sea, confined to a tiny spit of sand, unable to escape.

1602
02:05:59,365 --> 02:06:01,628
[SPEAKER_01]: But tonight, it's heavy stuff, heavy stuff.

1603
02:08:13,471 --> 02:08:16,554
[SPEAKER_06]: Song number two in tonight's cage match, Pendulum with Slam.

1604
02:08:16,614 --> 02:08:20,897
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see, was that song slammin' or do you want to slam that song into the ground?

1605
02:08:20,977 --> 02:08:27,122
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, give it a ten, because if you drive with that song really loud on your radio, it has a lot of bass in it.

1606
02:08:27,162 --> 02:08:27,543
[SPEAKER_06]: It's cool.

1607
02:08:28,904 --> 02:08:29,104
[SPEAKER_06]: Angel.

1608
02:08:31,616 --> 02:08:35,298
[SPEAKER_26]: Um, that makes me wanna, like, go kill a lion now or something.

1609
02:08:35,358 --> 02:08:39,881
[SPEAKER_26]: Sorry to those that play Alliance, but, um... God, this thing doesn't sound like it's on.

1610
02:08:40,021 --> 02:08:40,402
[SPEAKER_26]: Huh!

1611
02:08:41,062 --> 02:08:41,382
[SPEAKER_26]: It's on.

1612
02:08:41,542 --> 02:08:41,823
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay.

1613
02:08:42,023 --> 02:08:45,565
[SPEAKER_26]: Um... Oh, hell.

1614
02:08:46,265 --> 02:08:46,686
[SPEAKER_26]: Seven.

1615
02:08:49,407 --> 02:08:50,008
[SPEAKER_06]: I got bored.

1616
02:08:50,208 --> 02:08:50,528
[SPEAKER_06]: Three.

1617
02:08:51,269 --> 02:08:51,669
[SPEAKER_06]: Extra room.

1618
02:08:53,496 --> 02:09:02,405
[SPEAKER_15]: I kind of got bored too, but Loki did make a good point that this would be a good song to blast out your Harvard.

1619
02:09:02,766 --> 02:09:04,788
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, if you want to put the other people on the road to sleep.

1620
02:09:06,410 --> 02:09:08,752
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, you don't knock it until you've tried it.

1621
02:09:09,413 --> 02:09:09,773
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1622
02:09:09,994 --> 02:09:12,136
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, so I give it an 8 for that.

1623
02:09:12,697 --> 02:09:12,997
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

1624
02:09:14,537 --> 02:09:16,517
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember, it's not our thoughts that count.

1625
02:09:16,598 --> 02:09:17,298
[SPEAKER_06]: It's yours.

1626
02:09:17,398 --> 02:09:18,378
[SPEAKER_06]: You have the final say.

1627
02:09:18,418 --> 02:09:20,238
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's song number three in tonight's cage match.

1628
02:09:20,378 --> 02:09:26,700
[SPEAKER_06]: Even though the lovely DarkSakura is not here tonight, she was kind enough to provide this song for you guys.

1629
02:09:26,800 --> 02:09:28,440
[SPEAKER_06]: It's song number three, her song tonight.

1630
02:09:28,920 --> 02:09:31,401
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an artist that was in DDR USA.

1631
02:09:32,801 --> 02:09:34,522
[SPEAKER_06]: I shouldn't say DDR USA.

1632
02:09:34,542 --> 02:09:36,482
[SPEAKER_06]: I should say DDR Extreme USA.

1633
02:09:37,062 --> 02:09:38,003
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Junior Senior.

1634
02:09:38,523 --> 02:09:38,883
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember them?

1635
02:09:38,903 --> 02:09:39,683
[SPEAKER_06]: They did Move Your Feet.

1636
02:09:40,563 --> 02:09:41,704
[SPEAKER_06]: This is another song by them.

1637
02:09:41,764 --> 02:09:43,344
[SPEAKER_06]: It's called Shake Your Coconuts.

1638
02:09:44,721 --> 02:09:46,603
[SPEAKER_06]: So get ready to shake your coconuts to this song.

1639
02:09:46,643 --> 02:09:48,125
[SPEAKER_06]: It's song number three in tonight's skating match.

1640
02:09:48,205 --> 02:09:48,446
[SPEAKER_06]: Enjoy.

1641
02:11:03,851 --> 02:11:04,900
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

1642
02:11:54,286 --> 02:11:55,268
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for watching!

1643
02:12:19,016 --> 02:12:23,038
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, song number three in tonight's cage match, Junior Senior with Shake Your Coconuts.

1644
02:12:23,098 --> 02:12:24,439
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you shake your coconuts?

1645
02:12:25,179 --> 02:12:26,620
[SPEAKER_06]: Or was that song just nuts?

1646
02:12:26,720 --> 02:12:27,060
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1647
02:12:27,120 --> 02:12:27,481
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki.

1648
02:12:28,541 --> 02:12:29,182
[SPEAKER_06]: Get Loki a mic.

1649
02:12:30,342 --> 02:12:31,043
[SPEAKER_06]: That was lame.

1650
02:12:31,063 --> 02:12:32,763
[SPEAKER_06]: That was really lame.

1651
02:12:33,604 --> 02:12:34,724
[SPEAKER_06]: That was awful lame.

1652
02:12:35,305 --> 02:12:36,145
[SPEAKER_06]: It gives a four.

1653
02:12:37,106 --> 02:12:37,526
[SPEAKER_06]: Angel.

1654
02:12:41,648 --> 02:12:42,269
[SPEAKER_26]: It was okay.

1655
02:12:42,889 --> 02:12:47,051
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't mind that song, but, um, no.

1656
02:12:47,952 --> 02:12:48,572
[SPEAKER_26]: Six and a half.

1657
02:12:50,632 --> 02:12:51,273
[SPEAKER_15]: X-Deferred!

1658
02:12:52,294 --> 02:12:56,317
[SPEAKER_15]: Forgive me for saying this, but I felt like busting a nut.

1659
02:12:58,980 --> 02:13:01,042
[SPEAKER_28]: God damn it, I hate you!

1660
02:13:01,723 --> 02:13:04,966
[SPEAKER_15]: They said shake your coconut till the nut comes out or something like that.

1661
02:13:05,046 --> 02:13:05,666
[SPEAKER_15]: I think so, yes.

1662
02:13:06,087 --> 02:13:07,648
[SPEAKER_15]: That's pretty foul.

1663
02:13:08,008 --> 02:13:09,610
[SPEAKER_15]: I give it, like I said, for that.

1664
02:13:10,478 --> 02:13:14,519
[SPEAKER_15]: So vote for song 2 because we don't want song 1 to win.

1665
02:13:14,659 --> 02:13:16,719
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I'm behind Loki's whole scheme here.

1666
02:13:16,839 --> 02:13:17,240
[SPEAKER_06]: Shut up.

1667
02:13:18,900 --> 02:13:21,040
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought that song was awesome, you know why?

1668
02:13:21,180 --> 02:13:22,721
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it wasn't Pendulum.

1669
02:13:23,261 --> 02:13:27,502
[SPEAKER_06]: So therefore it gets an 8 automatically because it was awesome for not being Pendulum.

1670
02:13:27,622 --> 02:13:30,062
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think 8 really translates to awesome, Rob.

1671
02:13:30,242 --> 02:13:31,083
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not orgasmic.

1672
02:13:32,043 --> 02:13:33,583
[SPEAKER_15]: No, no, no, I don't think it really does.

1673
02:13:33,603 --> 02:13:34,663
[SPEAKER_06]: 8 is, you know what, shut up.

1674
02:13:35,264 --> 02:13:35,804
[SPEAKER_06]: Orgasmic would be 11.

1675
02:13:35,844 --> 02:13:36,144
[SPEAKER_06]: Shut up.

1676
02:13:39,383 --> 02:13:42,145
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's recap the songs you can vote for in tonight's cage match.

1677
02:13:42,625 --> 02:13:46,748
[SPEAKER_06]: Song number one is Pendulum with Hold Your Color.

1678
02:13:46,848 --> 02:13:47,769
[SPEAKER_06]: It's last week's winner.

1679
02:13:56,014 --> 02:13:59,637
[SPEAKER_06]: And song number two you can vote for in tonight's cage match is Slam.

1680
02:14:11,497 --> 02:14:15,419
[SPEAKER_06]: And song number three you can vote for tonight is Junior Senior with Shake Your Coconuts.

1681

[SPEAKER_06]: Place vote now.

1682
02:14:27,404 --> 02:14:30,245
[SPEAKER_06]: Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.

1683
02:14:31,035 --> 02:14:32,076
[SPEAKER_06]: and we'll let you know who won.

1684
02:14:32,276 --> 02:14:33,497
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember, it's not up to us.

1685
02:14:33,637 --> 02:14:36,239
[SPEAKER_06]: We're just big idiots.

1686
02:14:36,259 --> 02:14:37,781
[SPEAKER_15]: We're like the American Idol judges.

1687
02:14:37,801 --> 02:14:39,602
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, kind of, and it really isn't up to us.

1688
02:14:40,823 --> 02:14:41,944
[SPEAKER_15]: You would be Paula Abdul.

1689
02:14:42,565 --> 02:14:43,625
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not Paula Abdul.

1690
02:14:43,745 --> 02:14:46,027
[SPEAKER_06]: You're totally the Paula Abdul.

1691
02:14:46,468 --> 02:14:47,749
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm Randy Dog.

1692
02:14:49,030 --> 02:14:49,991
[SPEAKER_15]: What up, Dog?

1693
02:14:50,111 --> 02:14:51,092
[SPEAKER_15]: What up, Dog?

1694
02:14:51,232 --> 02:14:54,594
[SPEAKER_15]: I can't stand that fucking show right now.

1695
02:14:54,634 --> 02:14:56,036
[SPEAKER_11]: You watch it every year!

1696
02:14:56,476 --> 02:14:59,719
[SPEAKER_15]: I know, and the thing is, it's just like TV crack.

1697
02:15:00,455 --> 02:15:07,162
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, it's like you have to watch something that's kind of a guilty pleasure that you can't stand, but you watch it anyway.

1698
02:15:07,182 --> 02:15:09,684
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of like Jerry Springer.

1699
02:15:10,365 --> 02:15:11,686
[SPEAKER_06]: Ringmaster was on TV today.

1700
02:15:11,726 --> 02:15:13,088
[SPEAKER_06]: I had to watch it, or some of it.

1701
02:15:13,889 --> 02:15:16,892
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I actually saw Ringmaster in the theater the day it opened.

1702
02:15:17,633 --> 02:15:18,754
[SPEAKER_06]: Four people in the theater.

1703
02:15:21,797 --> 02:15:23,879
[SPEAKER_06]: Me and my roommate at the time and some other schmoes.

1704
02:15:24,915 --> 02:15:25,556
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1705
02:15:41,658 --> 02:15:44,802
[SPEAKER_15]: Day 2 is Send My Kids to Boot Camp

1706
02:15:58,464 --> 02:16:00,485
[SPEAKER_06]: Day 3 is my baby fat.

1707
02:16:02,626 --> 02:16:06,068
[SPEAKER_15]: Day 4 would be I know I'm fat but I'm gorgeous.

1708
02:16:06,448 --> 02:16:14,793
[SPEAKER_15]: How many times have you accidentally found yourself channel surfing and the channel lands on Maury Povich and it's about their baby being fat?

1709
02:16:16,233 --> 02:16:18,735
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, dude, stop feeding your kid!

1710
02:16:20,616 --> 02:16:22,017
[SPEAKER_25]: Like, shit!

1711
02:16:25,051 --> 02:16:26,372
[SPEAKER_25]: and we're supposed to feel sympathy.

1712
02:16:26,412 --> 02:16:30,835
[SPEAKER_25]: The mom's like, fuck, bitch, talk to your kid.

1713
02:16:34,237 --> 02:16:37,719
[SPEAKER_06]: I suppose we should get into the, do you have a movie review for us tonight, Extifer?

1714
02:16:37,879 --> 02:16:38,379
[SPEAKER_06]: I forgot to ask.

1715
02:16:38,459 --> 02:16:40,241
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, Extifer, I forgot to mention.

1716
02:16:40,921 --> 02:16:43,022
[SPEAKER_06]: Our work, because, you know, I work at a video distributor.

1717
02:16:43,783 --> 02:16:47,485
[SPEAKER_06]: Wednesday, we get, in our theater, we get to watch Serenity.

1718
02:16:47,945 --> 02:16:49,166
[SPEAKER_06]: So, for free.

1719
02:16:50,147 --> 02:16:50,527
[SPEAKER_06]: And we get pizza!

1720
02:16:50,547 --> 02:16:51,287
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty damn awesome.

1721
02:16:51,388 --> 02:16:52,588
[SPEAKER_06]: That is double awesome.

1722
02:16:52,608 --> 02:16:53,589
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I hope you enjoy it.

1723
02:16:54,011 --> 02:17:00,555
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, seeing Serenity for free is about the only way people are seeing it these days, apparently, because the movie's not making any money right now.

1724
02:17:02,236 --> 02:17:04,457
[SPEAKER_15]: You, that is very funny to you, isn't it?

1725
02:17:05,278 --> 02:17:07,579
[SPEAKER_15]: Sadistic bitch.

1726
02:17:07,999 --> 02:17:16,885
[SPEAKER_15]: No, but, you know, I saw it for free, actually, you know, a few months, or a couple months ago, maybe, a month and a half, and it was really good free.

1727
02:17:17,445 --> 02:17:19,566
[SPEAKER_15]: But it was also good when I paid money, so, you know.

1728
02:17:20,747 --> 02:17:20,847
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

1729
02:17:20,867 --> 02:17:20,947
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

1730
02:17:22,383 --> 02:17:23,884
[SPEAKER_15]: Are you going to do a movie review for us tonight?

1731
02:17:25,005 --> 02:17:27,067
[SPEAKER_15]: Sure, I'll think up a movie review.

1732
02:17:27,147 --> 02:17:30,369
[SPEAKER_15]: I haven't seen really any movies this week, so I'll think up one.

1733
02:17:30,809 --> 02:17:32,050
[SPEAKER_15]: Just don't play the gay music.

1734
02:17:34,172 --> 02:17:35,433
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll get to your gay review later.

1735
02:17:35,573 --> 02:17:38,034
[SPEAKER_06]: My fiance's been watching Desperate Housewives.

1736
02:17:38,255 --> 02:17:38,915
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, God.

1737
02:17:39,596 --> 02:17:41,397
[SPEAKER_06]: She's jumped on that bandwagon.

1738
02:17:43,138 --> 02:17:44,059
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody pity me.

1739
02:17:45,440 --> 02:17:46,941
[SPEAKER_06]: Next thing you know, it's going to be Lost, too.

1740
02:17:48,815 --> 02:17:50,577
[SPEAKER_06]: Like this bitch watches every week.

1741
02:17:50,677 --> 02:17:52,099
[SPEAKER_06]: We have the season one box set.

1742
02:17:52,179 --> 02:17:55,603
[SPEAKER_06]: It's in my pile of stuff that's going to be returned to GameStop for games.

1743
02:17:58,126 --> 02:18:00,489
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, we have Lost and she wants to watch that too.

1744
02:18:00,509 --> 02:18:01,070
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, no.

1745
02:18:03,906 --> 02:18:05,727
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to get to your sim update, Loki.

1746
02:18:05,767 --> 02:18:07,968
[SPEAKER_06]: What's going on in the sim scene?

1747
02:18:07,988 --> 02:18:11,809
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, okay, I actually do have the story now about that stupid button mash revolution thing.

1748
02:18:13,030 --> 02:18:15,971
[SPEAKER_06]: Finally found it because, you know, PSP updates hide their shit.

1749
02:18:16,331 --> 02:18:19,413
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways, it's this game called Button Mash Revolution Version 1.

1750
02:18:19,973 --> 02:18:20,833
[SPEAKER_06]: It's for the PSP.

1751
02:18:20,853 --> 02:18:23,634
[SPEAKER_06]: You can only run it if you have a version 1.5 firmware.

1752
02:18:25,835 --> 02:18:28,618
[SPEAKER_06]: And basically, it's like DDR, except you use your buttons.

1753
02:18:28,658 --> 02:18:29,539
[SPEAKER_06]: There are no arrows.

1754
02:18:29,619 --> 02:18:32,541
[SPEAKER_06]: Instead, there are the four corresponding buttons that are on the PSP.

1755
02:18:33,282 --> 02:18:35,984
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's music in it, and someone made it in Lua.

1756
02:18:37,125 --> 02:18:42,090
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't really know what kind of music is in it, because I haven't downloaded it yet, but it looks kind of fun.

1757
02:18:42,190 --> 02:18:48,175
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you're looking for something to waste some space on your memory card, check it out at PSPUpdates.com.

1758
02:18:48,215 --> 02:18:49,456
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to have to actually...

1759
02:18:50,270 --> 02:18:51,411
[SPEAKER_06]: Button Mash Revolution Version 1

1760
02:19:04,827 --> 02:19:06,008
[SPEAKER_06]: DJ Max Portable

1761
02:19:28,942 --> 02:19:32,404
[SPEAKER_06]: Just be really awesome to see some more music games coming to the PSP.

1762
02:19:32,744 --> 02:19:39,387
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you want to check out the website, I believe it's DJMax.com, but I'm not positive.

1763
02:19:40,408 --> 02:19:43,149
[SPEAKER_06]: Just search for DJ Max, and I'm sure you'll find it.

1764
02:19:45,390 --> 02:19:49,172
[SPEAKER_06]: And other than that, really, I don't think there's too much else going on in the sim scene.

1765
02:19:50,313 --> 02:19:56,456
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't been really paying attention to the sim scene because nothing really interesting has been going on for me.

1766
02:19:57,301 --> 02:20:01,024
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, tournaments and stuff, just like, eh, don't care.

1767
02:20:03,346 --> 02:20:06,729
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm glad you're a faithful reporter in the sim industry.

1768
02:20:06,809 --> 02:20:08,831
[SPEAKER_06]: There's really nothing going on, honestly.

1769
02:20:08,911 --> 02:20:13,455
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I'm sure if MySaw had their sim section up, there'd be more crappy remixes of Max.

1770
02:20:14,076 --> 02:20:17,279
[SPEAKER_06]: But unfortunately, I can't report on that because there is no sim section anymore.

1771
02:20:17,799 --> 02:20:22,043
[SPEAKER_06]: I do know of a new torrent site that came up that has some stuff on it, but...

1772
02:20:23,991 --> 02:20:25,313
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's about it.

1773
02:20:26,254 --> 02:20:29,838
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm more interested in checking out Ultramix 3 when that comes out in a couple weeks.

1774
02:20:30,339 --> 02:20:34,585
[SPEAKER_06]: As well as all my 360 games coming at the same time.

1775
02:20:34,605 --> 02:20:36,567
[SPEAKER_06]: I know I gotta save my money for the 360.

1776
02:20:37,208 --> 02:20:40,272
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not looking forward to spending that kind of money, but what can you do?

1777
02:20:40,589 --> 02:20:41,029
[SPEAKER_06]: That's okay.

1778
02:20:41,510 --> 02:20:42,751
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to be getting my controllers.

1779
02:20:42,791 --> 02:20:44,192
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got about four games lined up.

1780
02:20:44,512 --> 02:20:47,694
[SPEAKER_06]: Just, you know, with all the store credit I've earned in the last few months.

1781
02:20:48,215 --> 02:20:49,596
[SPEAKER_06]: And just fun stuff like that.

1782
02:20:49,876 --> 02:20:56,441
[SPEAKER_06]: And hopefully, because now it's the first party, hopefully I can hit up some of our publishers and go, Hey, can you send me a free copy?

1783
02:20:56,801 --> 02:20:57,202
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, come on.

1784
02:20:58,363 --> 02:21:02,286
[SPEAKER_06]: Xbox Live, they're taking it down for a day to do some adjustments or something.

1785
02:21:02,346 --> 02:21:06,349
[SPEAKER_06]: So are they going to have the Xbox 360 interface on the regular Xbox or something?

1786
02:21:06,369 --> 02:21:06,709
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1787
02:21:07,489 --> 02:21:09,650
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they're taking down live because they're updating everything.

1788
02:21:09,910 --> 02:21:17,913
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to actually have a website now where you can download all your stats and everything on live and people can actually view all that stuff, what games you're playing, what accomplishments you've done.

1789
02:21:18,554 --> 02:21:25,116
[SPEAKER_06]: They've been announcing more stuff for the Xbox Live Arcade, the new one being Tetris is now on there because Tetris is on every system on the man.

1790
02:21:25,236 --> 02:21:25,396
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

1791
02:21:26,017 --> 02:21:26,157
[SPEAKER_06]: And...

1792
02:21:27,290 --> 02:21:29,612
[SPEAKER_06]: Just lots of cool stuff they're doing for live.

1793
02:21:30,052 --> 02:21:35,876
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm hoping that they're not using the same gamer tags, though, because I really want to get on there first and get Loki.

1794
02:21:36,957 --> 02:21:38,838
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm wondering if they're going to carry the gamer tags over.

1795
02:21:39,278 --> 02:21:40,539
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think so.

1796
02:21:40,819 --> 02:21:41,660
[SPEAKER_06]: I wouldn't think so.

1797
02:21:41,680 --> 02:21:43,041
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be interesting if they did.

1798
02:21:43,121 --> 02:21:43,501
[SPEAKER_06]: They might.

1799
02:21:43,541 --> 02:21:44,062
[SPEAKER_06]: Who knows?

1800
02:21:44,122 --> 02:21:46,323
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they would have to for the backwards compatibility thing.

1801
02:21:46,343 --> 02:21:47,044
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they'd have to.

1802
02:21:47,444 --> 02:21:47,704
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe.

1803
02:21:47,724 --> 02:21:48,244
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's okay.

1804
02:21:48,284 --> 02:21:49,866
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a backup name just in case.

1805
02:21:50,066 --> 02:21:50,426
[SPEAKER_06]: What's that?

1806
02:21:51,292 --> 02:21:53,174
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't say, because someone's going to steal it.

1807
02:21:53,715 --> 02:21:54,075
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.

1808
02:21:54,896 --> 02:21:58,220
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not too far from, you know, the name I go by.

1809
02:21:58,441 --> 02:21:58,781
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1810
02:21:59,522 --> 02:22:00,703
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, Super Loki?

1811
02:22:01,344 --> 02:22:01,524
[SPEAKER_00]: Loki 6969?

1812
02:22:01,564 --> 02:22:01,624
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

1813
02:22:06,050 --> 02:22:06,350
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1814
02:22:06,931 --> 02:22:10,554
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't say my frickin' World of Warcraft name on air.

1815
02:22:11,995 --> 02:22:13,957
[SPEAKER_06]: Or, um, well, you know, close enough.

1816
02:22:13,977 --> 02:22:15,298
[SPEAKER_06]: He doesn't have a mic, it doesn't matter.

1817
02:22:15,318 --> 02:22:16,960
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, this is a good thing.

1818
02:22:18,521 --> 02:22:22,084
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, um, let's get to Extraverse Movie Review before we get to a break.

1819
02:22:22,925 --> 02:22:23,706
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't have a movie yet?

1820
02:22:23,866 --> 02:22:24,947
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, fine, then we'll have to go to a break.

1821
02:22:26,547 --> 02:22:28,228
[SPEAKER_06]: To be continued.

1822
02:27:00,104 --> 02:27:01,025
Thanks for watching!

1823
02:27:43,130 --> 02:27:43,951
Thanks for watching!

1824
02:28:11,212 --> 02:28:11,472
and more.

1825
02:29:04,653 --> 02:29:07,781
Thanks for watching!

1826
02:30:40,905 --> 02:30:41,866
[SPEAKER_05]: Gaming Radio.

1827
02:30:42,106 --> 02:30:49,389
[SPEAKER_05]: So uncensored that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.

1828
02:30:49,550 --> 02:30:50,890
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Lounge Radio.

1829
02:30:51,551 --> 02:30:53,712
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi kids!

1830
02:30:55,112 --> 02:30:55,693
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello.

1831
02:30:55,913 --> 02:30:57,734
[SPEAKER_06]: We're back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1832
02:30:58,780 --> 02:31:01,261
[SPEAKER_06]: Just having ourselves a good old time on this Sunday evening.

1833
02:31:01,461 --> 02:31:03,962
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for deciding to tune in and listen to us.

1834
02:31:04,082 --> 02:31:04,883
[SPEAKER_06]: We appreciate it.

1835
02:31:05,803 --> 02:31:06,984
[SPEAKER_06]: Although I'm kind of tired today.

1836
02:31:07,024 --> 02:31:09,885
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just like, kind of sluggish.

1837
02:31:09,905 --> 02:31:11,366
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, it's a lazy Sunday.

1838
02:31:11,386 --> 02:31:14,247
[SPEAKER_15]: Of course, we were up like totally late last night.

1839
02:31:14,307 --> 02:31:19,650
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've been doing a little drinking, so maybe I have a little bit of a hangover.

1840
02:31:19,890 --> 02:31:20,910
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe a little bit.

1841
02:31:21,291 --> 02:31:22,051
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a little bit.

1842
02:31:23,792 --> 02:31:24,112
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

1843
02:31:25,662 --> 02:31:30,405
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I guess now is the part of the show where I'm not going to do extra first movie review.

1844
02:31:30,785 --> 02:31:30,945
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh.

1845
02:31:31,565 --> 02:31:33,546
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I want to tell you guys who won tonight's cage match.

1846
02:31:34,647 --> 02:31:34,967
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1847
02:31:35,267 --> 02:31:36,748
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is certainly something we need to hear about.

1848
02:31:37,528 --> 02:31:41,591
[SPEAKER_06]: So the winner of tonight's cage match, it was one vote deciding things tonight, you guys.

1849
02:31:41,611 --> 02:31:43,812
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a very, very close cage match.

1850
02:31:44,492 --> 02:31:46,413
[SPEAKER_06]: Except for song number two, which got like no votes.

1851
02:31:48,454 --> 02:31:51,916
[SPEAKER_06]: But the winning song by one vote in tonight's cage match is...

1852
02:31:54,226 --> 02:32:00,989
[SPEAKER_06]: The Pendulum, Hold Your Color, for the third week in a row.

1853
02:32:01,109 --> 02:32:03,730
[SPEAKER_06]: Next week, it goes for retirement.

1854
02:32:03,830 --> 02:32:06,411
[SPEAKER_06]: If it is the winner next week, it will be retired.

1855
02:32:06,771 --> 02:32:09,352
[SPEAKER_06]: It will be the first song to be retired in quite a while.

1856
02:32:09,632 --> 02:32:17,395
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we had a song get retired by default, but I don't even remember because we missed two shows, and so it kind of held over for four weeks.

1857
02:32:17,435 --> 02:32:18,036
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to say it was...

1858
02:32:19,591 --> 02:32:22,193
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1859
02:32:47,159 --> 02:32:47,619
[SPEAKER_15]: No!

1860
02:32:47,920 --> 02:32:51,663
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, I spoke out of... I didn't mean to say that.

1861
02:32:53,604 --> 02:32:54,605
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm starting to review.

1862
02:32:54,625 --> 02:32:55,506
[SPEAKER_15]: You can't play the song now.

1863
02:32:55,666 --> 02:32:56,507
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, well... Oh, look.

1864
02:32:56,767 --> 02:32:57,528
[SPEAKER_15]: You can't play it.

1865
02:32:57,948 --> 02:32:59,589
[SPEAKER_15]: What are you going to be reviewing?

1866
02:32:59,990 --> 02:33:02,292
[SPEAKER_15]: The movie I'm reviewing this week is Sphere.

1867
02:33:03,272 --> 02:33:06,715
[SPEAKER_15]: Remember that movie, Terror Can Fill Any Space?

1868
02:33:07,456 --> 02:33:07,636
[SPEAKER_29]: No.

1869
02:33:08,216 --> 02:33:08,337
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh.

1870
02:33:08,757 --> 02:33:12,360
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, that's what it says on the box art of Sphere.

1871
02:33:13,337 --> 02:33:19,404
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's from the best-selling author of Jurassic Park and The Lost World, otherwise known as Michael Crichton.

1872
02:33:21,306 --> 02:33:22,907
[SPEAKER_15]: Little info on some critics here.

1873
02:33:23,087 --> 02:33:28,213
[SPEAKER_15]: Janet Maslin from the New York Times called it rich in techno terror.

1874
02:33:29,215 --> 02:33:32,118
[SPEAKER_15]: A Solid Thriller Directed with Sustained Tension

1875
02:33:45,831 --> 02:34:01,438
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyways, so I think Sphere was okay, I mean it wasn't great, but if you want to see Queen Latifah get killed by jellyfish, then I guess that would be the movie to watch, like her getting killed by jellyfish.

1876
02:34:02,839 --> 02:34:04,140
[SPEAKER_15]: Rob, do you have anything to add to that?

1877
02:34:06,421 --> 02:34:08,522
[SPEAKER_06]: From getting eaten by jellyfish to Pizza Hut commercials.

1878
02:34:09,096 --> 02:34:20,704
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, basically the movie, the premise of the movie is that everybody's fears manifest themselves and they're down under, like deep, deep, deep into the ocean or water or whatever.

1879
02:34:21,584 --> 02:34:26,688
[SPEAKER_15]: And basically, like, people get killed by their own fears, basically.

1880
02:34:27,108 --> 02:34:29,390
[SPEAKER_15]: And Queen Latifah... Hey, Hector, can you hold on a minute?

1881
02:34:33,512 --> 02:34:34,793
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry, I'm rocking out a little bit.

1882
02:34:35,714 --> 02:34:36,454
[SPEAKER_15]: Of course you are.

1883
02:34:37,415 --> 02:34:38,135
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, sorry, go ahead.

1884
02:34:39,594 --> 02:34:45,216
[SPEAKER_15]: So, I'm sorry, I just got, I got stupid just then, because you played that song.

1885
02:34:45,717 --> 02:35:00,403
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, no, the, so the movie basically is, it's really average, um, you know, I would give it a thumb sideways, um, because, you know, I'd give it an apathetic thumb anywhere, because I don't really care.

1886
02:35:01,204 --> 02:35:05,707
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, and, um, you know, again, Queen Latifah died from jellyfish in it.

1887
02:35:06,288 --> 02:35:09,330
[SPEAKER_15]: Again, I'd like to reiterate, she died from jellyfish.

1888
02:35:09,350 --> 02:35:10,691
[SPEAKER_15]: She was like, oh my god!

1889
02:35:11,771 --> 02:35:13,873
[SPEAKER_15]: I got killed by some damn jellyfish!

1890
02:35:15,954 --> 02:35:22,339
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh my god, I gotta do Pizza Hut commercials, and I have to do Bringin' Down the House with Steve Martin in a few years.

1891
02:35:22,399 --> 02:35:24,320
[SPEAKER_25]: I can't die from some damn jellyfish?

1892
02:35:25,261 --> 02:35:26,221
[SPEAKER_06]: And don't forget Chicago.

1893
02:35:27,082 --> 02:35:27,862
[SPEAKER_25]: Chicago, too!

1894
02:35:28,303 --> 02:35:30,184
[SPEAKER_06]: When you're good to mama, mama's good to you, remember?

1895
02:35:30,546 --> 02:35:31,067
[SPEAKER_15]: That's right.

1896
02:35:32,027 --> 02:35:36,131
[SPEAKER_15]: She said, damn, god damn jellyfish.

1897
02:35:36,171 --> 02:35:38,273
[SPEAKER_15]: No, the jellyfish, that was really funny.

1898
02:35:38,314 --> 02:35:40,295
[SPEAKER_15]: And she acts really scared in it.

1899
02:35:40,376 --> 02:35:40,756
[SPEAKER_15]: It's great.

1900
02:35:41,701 --> 02:35:42,842
[SPEAKER_15]: That's the best scene in the movie.

1901
02:35:43,342 --> 02:35:44,663
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, Queen Latifah getting eaten by jellyfish?

1902
02:35:44,683 --> 02:35:46,004
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, being eaten by jellyfish.

1903
02:35:46,244 --> 02:35:47,085
[SPEAKER_06]: Or being killed by jellyfish.

1904
02:35:47,125 --> 02:35:50,867
[SPEAKER_06]: So, Spear gets this apathetic thumb, but Queen Latifah getting eaten by jellyfish is the thumbs up.

1905
02:35:50,887 --> 02:35:52,408
[SPEAKER_06]: That is really the high point of the movie.

1906
02:35:52,428 --> 02:35:56,431
[SPEAKER_15]: It's really kind of at the beginning, so I would recommend that part.

1907
02:35:56,511 --> 02:36:00,074
[SPEAKER_15]: So, I'm glad you listened to my little, you know, segment here.

1908
02:36:00,334 --> 02:36:01,234
[SPEAKER_15]: It was so interesting.

1909
02:36:03,656 --> 02:36:04,376
[SPEAKER_06]: Listen tomorrow.

1910
02:36:04,416 --> 02:36:04,857
[SPEAKER_06]: It's my new show.

1911
02:36:04,877 --> 02:36:05,337
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm rocking out.

1912
02:36:05,998 --> 02:36:07,599
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm rocking out to your gay ABBA.

1913
02:36:08,799 --> 02:36:09,640
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not my gay ABBA.

1914
02:36:09,660 --> 02:36:10,561
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, your gay ABBA.

1915
02:36:10,901 --> 02:36:11,101
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not.

1916
02:36:14,850 --> 02:36:19,493
[SPEAKER_15]: I still say there should be a machine called the ABBA, like an AB machine.

1917
02:36:19,974 --> 02:36:23,956
[SPEAKER_15]: Every single time you crunch, it'll play a little bit of Dancing Queen or something.

1918
02:36:25,117 --> 02:36:25,437
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1919
02:36:26,078 --> 02:36:31,081
[SPEAKER_15]: Or it'll go, like as you crunch it.

1920
02:36:31,101 --> 02:36:36,325
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's about time that we get into the Orange Launch Radio Cage Match.

1921
02:36:36,665 --> 02:36:38,646
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we're starting to get into that portion of the show.

1922
02:36:39,387 --> 02:36:41,368
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure some of you guys are starting to get a little angsty.

1923
02:36:41,649 --> 02:36:42,149
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys, this is...

1924
02:36:44,059 --> 02:36:45,160
[SPEAKER_06]: Did I say the cage match?

1925
02:36:45,180 --> 02:36:46,741
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, the FU's of the week.

1926
02:36:48,563 --> 02:36:49,383
[SPEAKER_06]: It's one of those nights.

1927
02:36:49,463 --> 02:36:50,464
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't give a fuck tonight.

1928
02:36:50,524 --> 02:36:51,044
[SPEAKER_06]: I really don't.

1929
02:36:53,366 --> 02:36:53,747
[SPEAKER_06]: That's alright.

1930
02:36:53,767 --> 02:36:55,808
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to get into the FU's of the week because we're angsty.

1931
02:36:56,068 --> 02:36:57,590
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe we're angsty because of cage match.

1932
02:36:57,630 --> 02:36:57,950
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1933
02:36:58,590 --> 02:37:06,917
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway, DarkSakura isn't here tonight, but usually this is the part of the show where I would say, DarkSakura, why is it we do the FU's of the week every single week?

1934
02:37:07,017 --> 02:37:08,058
[SPEAKER_06]: And then what would she say?

1935
02:37:08,118 --> 02:37:10,580
[SPEAKER_06]: Something like, because we're angsty?

1936
02:37:10,660 --> 02:37:12,041
[SPEAKER_06]: No, she says, ger arg, right?

1937
02:37:22,827 --> 02:37:27,350
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura did leave a little message for me on AOL because she was a little bit angsty.

1938
02:37:27,410 --> 02:37:31,093
[SPEAKER_06]: She said, had the most retarded field trip for school today.

1939
02:37:31,173 --> 02:37:32,134
[SPEAKER_06]: That's my FU.

1940
02:37:32,514 --> 02:37:33,835
[SPEAKER_06]: Retarded field trips.

1941
02:37:34,796 --> 02:37:36,738
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't know you got to go on field trips in college.

1942
02:37:36,798 --> 02:37:37,738
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe I should have finished.

1943
02:37:41,241 --> 02:37:42,422
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, what's your FUs of the week?

1944
02:37:46,074 --> 02:37:52,040
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, my first FU goes to, um, stupid drivers out there, because you're driving too damn slow, and getting in my way.

1945
02:37:52,541 --> 02:38:06,996
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, my other FU goes to my apartment complex for deciding to repave the entire, um, parking lot, and basically rearrange some of the parking spaces and putting in some brand new handicapped ones, because the handicapped people have, like, all these 15 spaces that they can park in,

1946
02:38:07,452 --> 02:38:24,871
[SPEAKER_06]: for all the two handicapped people in our complex and they have they put them in some really stupid spots like this one that's in this one spot where the actual ramp to where the handicapped people can go up is like way far away from it and also the fact that there's a giant curb in its way so it's kind of pointless to have a ramp there anyways

1947
02:38:25,592 --> 02:38:27,514
[SPEAKER_06]: So, my apartment complex is retarded.

1948
02:38:27,814 --> 02:38:32,319
[SPEAKER_06]: And also, fuck you, these stupid kids that keep throwing this tennis ball against the dumpster and playing Butts Up.

1949
02:38:34,061 --> 02:38:35,382
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, I remember Butts Up.

1950
02:38:35,422 --> 02:38:36,203
[SPEAKER_06]: That game was awesome.

1951
02:38:36,223 --> 02:38:42,910
[SPEAKER_06]: These kids need to go someplace, so I stole their tennis ball, and it's in my house now, but they bought another one, so I have to steal that one, too.

1952
02:38:42,930 --> 02:38:43,331
[SPEAKER_06]: You see this?

1953
02:38:43,571 --> 02:38:44,332
[SPEAKER_06]: This is mine now.

1954
02:38:44,712 --> 02:38:45,373
[SPEAKER_06]: This is mine now.

1955
02:38:46,534 --> 02:38:47,135
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

1956
02:38:48,016 --> 02:38:48,376
[SPEAKER_06]: Freaking...

1957
02:38:48,916 --> 02:38:49,516
[SPEAKER_06]: Stupid people.

1958
02:38:49,716 --> 02:38:50,097
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate them.

1959
02:38:50,537 --> 02:39:05,104
[SPEAKER_06]: And also, uh, fuck you, the stupid woman that basically, uh, got all pissed off for Nelly having taken out her, um, laundry that had been sitting in one of the washers just unattended because it was already down to its cycle and she's all, WHERE MY CLOTHES AT?

1960
02:39:07,185 --> 02:39:08,606
[SPEAKER_06]: And she's like, well, they're in the basket.

1961
02:39:09,366 --> 02:39:11,327
[SPEAKER_06]: BETTER NOT BE STEALING MY CLOTHES!

1962
02:39:13,299 --> 02:39:16,601
[SPEAKER_06]: And she had her freaking shower cap on and stuff.

1963
02:39:16,841 --> 02:39:18,722
[SPEAKER_06]: Total ghetto woman.

1964
02:39:18,802 --> 02:39:20,603
[SPEAKER_06]: You should have threatened them with some jellyfish.

1965
02:39:21,704 --> 02:39:22,884
[SPEAKER_06]: Where my clothes at?

1966
02:39:22,904 --> 02:39:24,765
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

1967
02:39:24,845 --> 02:39:25,646
[SPEAKER_06]: I can tell you this much.

1968
02:39:25,726 --> 02:39:29,688
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd be handling the situation differently if I was in there.

1969
02:39:30,708 --> 02:39:31,989
[SPEAKER_06]: She'd be like, where my clothes at?

1970
02:39:32,009 --> 02:39:34,130
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'd be like, talking English, bitch.

1971
02:39:35,991 --> 02:39:36,551
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah.

1972
02:39:37,411 --> 02:39:38,472
[SPEAKER_06]: That's my abuse of the week.

1973
02:39:46,616 --> 02:39:48,037
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm relatively angst-free.

1974
02:39:48,417 --> 02:39:53,799
[SPEAKER_06]: I got most of my angst out in my live journal earlier this week, because that's what live journals are for, is for memes.

1975
02:39:54,159 --> 02:39:56,320
[SPEAKER_06]: I know they're called memes or whatever, but I call them memes.

1976
02:39:57,320 --> 02:40:00,921
[SPEAKER_06]: Live journals for memes and me venting once in a while.

1977
02:40:00,961 --> 02:40:03,482
[SPEAKER_06]: So I've actually got most of it out of my system, so I feel pretty good.

1978
02:40:04,663 --> 02:40:14,026
[SPEAKER_06]: But just an F you to, like, three days this week I ended up staying at work, like, way later than I was originally intending to, and I don't like that.

1979
02:40:15,347 --> 02:40:15,447
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

1980
02:40:16,863 --> 02:40:20,784
[SPEAKER_06]: An FU to dumbasses in World of Warcraft, because there's been a couple that kind of pissed me off.

1981
02:40:20,804 --> 02:40:24,486
[SPEAKER_06]: An FU to the fact that I haven't gotten onto other servers yet, but I swear I'm going to at some point.

1982
02:40:26,446 --> 02:40:31,388
[SPEAKER_06]: And an FU to me having to save money for an Xbox 360, because I don't like being poor.

1983
02:40:31,948 --> 02:40:32,528
[SPEAKER_06]: Being poor sucks.

1984
02:40:33,929 --> 02:40:35,329
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.

1985
02:40:35,369 --> 02:40:37,610
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's get to Angel and Angel's FUs of the week.

1986
02:40:41,158 --> 02:40:42,139
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, let's see.

1987
02:40:43,159 --> 02:40:45,680
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm still kind of pretty pissed off at my computer even though it works now.

1988
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:46,780
[SPEAKER_26]: So, F you to that.

1989
02:40:47,140 --> 02:40:52,302
[SPEAKER_26]: Because if it hadn't broken down, I would be level 40 by now.

1990
02:40:52,502 --> 02:40:55,163
[SPEAKER_26]: Because, um, yeah.

1991
02:40:55,243 --> 02:40:57,124
[SPEAKER_26]: Damn level requirements for guilds.

1992
02:40:57,204 --> 02:40:57,704
[SPEAKER_26]: Jesus.

1993
02:40:59,385 --> 02:41:01,926
[SPEAKER_26]: Speaking of which, I have to hit level 50 by next Tuesday.

1994
02:41:01,966 --> 02:41:04,867
[SPEAKER_26]: So, F you to that too because I don't even know if I'm going to make it.

1995
02:41:06,107 --> 02:41:08,808
[SPEAKER_26]: Um, other than that...

1996
02:41:10,547 --> 02:41:13,128
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, yeah, I've been to go to school four days a week now.

1997
02:41:13,408 --> 02:41:13,628
[SPEAKER_26]: Ouch.

1998
02:41:14,169 --> 02:41:15,529
[SPEAKER_26]: But it must be done.

1999
02:41:15,629 --> 02:41:15,870
[SPEAKER_26]: Why?

2000
02:41:15,950 --> 02:41:22,753
[SPEAKER_26]: Because then I can get a better job later on or something or whatever you're supposed to do after you go to school.

2001
02:41:22,953 --> 02:41:24,113
[SPEAKER_26]: Heh, heh, heh, heh.

2002
02:41:24,373 --> 02:41:26,054
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, that's really it.

2003
02:41:26,254 --> 02:41:29,036
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm not really that pissy this week or something.

2004
02:41:30,276 --> 02:41:33,638
[SPEAKER_26]: So, um, yeah, until next time.

2005
02:41:35,499 --> 02:41:37,399
[SPEAKER_06]: Xtifer, what are your FUs of the week?

2006
02:41:38,480 --> 02:41:38,540
[SPEAKER_15]: Um,

2007
02:41:39,810 --> 02:41:43,217
[SPEAKER_15]: F you to God, because if you really do exist, you're fucking with my week.

2008
02:41:44,339 --> 02:41:46,544
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, Jesus Christ, God.

2009
02:41:47,938 --> 02:41:53,720
[SPEAKER_15]: I am so fucking pissed off because I will be very, very fine and everything.

2010
02:41:54,080 --> 02:41:57,822
[SPEAKER_15]: Then I go to the lab and I try to give blood and suddenly I almost faint.

2011
02:41:57,862 --> 02:41:59,122
[SPEAKER_15]: You were trying to give blood.

2012
02:41:59,242 --> 02:42:01,223
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, I was trying to get blood work done.

2013
02:42:02,103 --> 02:42:09,406
[SPEAKER_15]: And now I have to go back to the lab because I couldn't do enough work and just more stuff that I have to think about doing.

2014
02:42:10,346 --> 02:42:11,066
[SPEAKER_15]: So, yeah.

2015
02:42:11,586 --> 02:42:12,327
[SPEAKER_15]: So F you to that.

2016
02:42:12,747 --> 02:42:13,347
[SPEAKER_15]: F you to just...

2017
02:42:17,188 --> 02:42:18,488
[SPEAKER_15]: Last week in general.

2018
02:42:19,789 --> 02:42:20,229
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

2019
02:42:21,129 --> 02:42:22,449
[SPEAKER_15]: It was just a really difficult week.

2020
02:42:22,809 --> 02:42:24,930
[SPEAKER_15]: No, actually, you know, it ended really well.

2021
02:42:25,030 --> 02:42:26,570
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, we had a good night last night.

2022
02:42:27,530 --> 02:42:28,850
[SPEAKER_15]: Good partying.

2023
02:42:29,951 --> 02:42:31,311
[SPEAKER_15]: Partaking in a partay.

2024
02:42:32,611 --> 02:42:33,211
[SPEAKER_15]: It was neat.

2025
02:42:34,491 --> 02:42:35,452
[SPEAKER_15]: It was nifty.

2026
02:42:35,952 --> 02:42:36,852
[SPEAKER_15]: But otherwise, yeah.

2027
02:42:37,912 --> 02:42:42,033
[SPEAKER_15]: Otherwise, F you to everyone who won't listen to my show tomorrow at 7 o'clock.

2028
02:42:44,250 --> 02:42:48,253
[SPEAKER_15]: X-O-T-C-M Will you be playing Madonna hung up on your show?

2029
02:42:48,313 --> 02:42:51,756
[SPEAKER_15]: I will not be playing that song.

2030
02:42:52,436 --> 02:42:58,941
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I haven't even talked about the Rob Roberts show on Wednesday, which is going to be a big, huge Mondo OLR event.

2031
02:42:59,341 --> 02:43:00,562
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm so freaking excited.

2032
02:43:00,582 --> 02:43:01,663
[SPEAKER_06]: 7 o'clock Wednesday.

2033
02:43:05,226 --> 02:43:07,027
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's get to our chatroom FUs.

2034
02:43:09,514 --> 02:43:13,476
[SPEAKER_06]: Dark Knight says, F you to work and finding out that I have no car.

2035
02:43:14,317 --> 02:43:18,119
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, F you to gas prices, even though they are starting to go down just a tad.

2036
02:43:20,500 --> 02:43:21,881
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and whoops, where did my music go?

2037
02:43:21,901 --> 02:43:25,443
[SPEAKER_06]: My music went away for the, uh... It's because you played that fucking Madonna song.

2038
02:43:25,463 --> 02:43:27,344
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess I'll just have to go back to the fucking Madonna song.

2039
02:43:27,364 --> 02:43:27,744
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, guys.

2040
02:43:30,445 --> 02:43:32,646
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, let's see, whatever, uh, the other F yous here.

2041
02:43:32,687 --> 02:43:33,687
[SPEAKER_06]: We got Ninst.

2042
02:43:36,429 --> 02:43:37,109
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, whoops, I'm sorry.

2043
02:43:38,561 --> 02:43:41,123
[SPEAKER_06]: That was, uh, it was, um, something else for me.

2044
02:43:42,344 --> 02:43:47,668
[SPEAKER_06]: Um... Socorina says, F you to me for not voting for the cage match.

2045
02:43:48,388 --> 02:43:54,733
[SPEAKER_06]: F you to my parents for being behind me when two hot girls asked me if I wanted to fuck them after clearing max 300 standard.

2046
02:43:57,135 --> 02:43:57,475
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

2047
02:43:58,356 --> 02:43:59,917
[SPEAKER_06]: That, that doesn't happen.

2048
02:44:01,698 --> 02:44:02,039
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

2049
02:44:06,102 --> 02:44:07,603
[SPEAKER_06]: Misty says, um...

2050
02:44:09,674 --> 02:44:11,536
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, she was giving me a suggestion for FUs.

2051
02:44:11,576 --> 02:44:13,317
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, I got to them a little late there.

02:44:13,877 --> 02:44:18,981
[SPEAKER_06]: NintendoManiac64 says, FU to Loki for commenting on what you did with my foot last night.

2053
02:44:19,041 --> 02:44:19,942
[SPEAKER_06]: You and your sick mind.

2054
02:44:21,042 --> 02:44:27,047
[SPEAKER_06]: FU to myself for forgetting to put a not before the word commenting in my previous FU, which would make that FU true.

2055
02:44:28,118 --> 02:44:30,182
[SPEAKER_06]: F you to Sky for talking during my Skype time.

2056

[SPEAKER_06]: F you to whoever chose the MK64 retro tracks in Mario Kart DS.

2058
02:44:36,051 --> 02:44:37,494
[SPEAKER_06]: There's none of the awesome ones.

2059
02:44:37,914 --> 02:44:39,998
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, they didn't put like Toad's Highway?

2060
02:44:40,038 --> 02:44:41,080
[SPEAKER_06]: That was like the best track ever.

2061
02:44:46,854 --> 02:44:50,936
[SPEAKER_06]: Glutwalk says F you to the coat hanger and the handicapped stall in the bathroom at my workplace.

2062
02:44:51,376 --> 02:44:57,759
[SPEAKER_06]: That damn thing was placed so low it practically punctured my right arm and I've got a huge honking bruise the size of two silver dollars.

2063
02:44:57,839 --> 02:44:58,300
[SPEAKER_06]: Damn you!

02:45:02,242 --> 02:45:08,525
[SPEAKER_06]: Color of Sakura says F you to the fact that I was diagnosed with a peptic ulcer last week and making me not able to do anything.

02:45:35,662 --> 02:45:36,663
[SPEAKER_06]: Aw, you guys did fine.

2068
02:45:37,603 --> 02:45:41,806
[SPEAKER_06]: Duran says, F you to people who email 50 fucking times a day.

2069
02:45:42,746 --> 02:45:45,508
[SPEAKER_06]: Specifically, F you to people who keep emailing me 50 times a day.

2070
02:45:45,748 --> 02:45:47,089
[SPEAKER_06]: And are they all chain letters?

2071
02:45:47,889 --> 02:45:48,570
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate that shit.

2072
02:45:48,650 --> 02:45:49,030
[SPEAKER_06]: Me too.

2073
02:45:49,250 --> 02:45:52,532
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why I'm kind of glad Myspace exists, because that's where all the chain letters go now.

2074
02:45:53,390 --> 02:46:07,698
[SPEAKER_06]: GS191 says F you to Tommy Talarco for giving We Heart Katamari a fucking 3 out of 10 F you to my friend for bricking his PSP, he deserved it and a continuing F you to my online math class A 3 out of 10 for We Heart Katamari?

2082
02:46:49,338 --> 02:46:53,241
[SPEAKER_06]: HIFL instead of Hell, and Hercule instead of Mr. Satan.

2083
02:46:53,721 --> 02:46:55,742
[SPEAKER_06]: The game is rated teen, you don't need to do that.

2084
02:46:55,842 --> 02:46:58,284
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, you don't even need to do that with an E-rated game.

2085
02:47:01,826 --> 02:47:05,327
[SPEAKER_06]: Roz says, F you to old ladies coughing on me for an hour and a half.

02:47:05,568 --> 02:47:09,470
[SPEAKER_06]: F you to the health teacher who accused me of plagiarism and then denied it like three days later.

2087
02:47:10,828 --> 02:47:13,489
[SPEAKER_06]: What is it about science teachers and assholes, them being assholes?

2088
02:47:13,529 --> 02:47:14,690
[SPEAKER_15]: In church, in general.

2089
02:47:14,910 --> 02:47:15,430
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm kidding.

02:47:15,490 --> 02:47:20,232
[SPEAKER_06]: Ron Chan says, to go along with Loki, a massive F you to people who take clothes out of the laundry machines.

02:47:20,312 --> 02:47:21,933
[SPEAKER_06]: No one told you to touch my clothes, okay?

2092
02:47:22,213 --> 02:47:24,654
[SPEAKER_06]: You can wait five fucking minutes until I walk back into the laundromat.

2093
02:47:25,014 --> 02:47:28,496
[SPEAKER_06]: And on behalf of the chatroom, F you to Socorina for talking smack about Captain Jack.

02:47:37,967 --> 02:47:44,856
[SPEAKER_06]: and then lastly, Dirty Thief says, F you to my friend who hit me in the crotch with a shoe twice in one day.

2097
02:47:49,081 --> 02:47:50,082
[SPEAKER_06]: That sounds pretty hot.

2098
02:47:52,165 --> 02:47:52,806
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, though...

2099
02:47:53,570 --> 02:48:00,093
[SPEAKER_15]: That is a segment in America's Funniest Home Videos that's so way overdone.

2100
02:48:00,873 --> 02:48:03,374
[SPEAKER_15]: They always have those videos of people getting hit in the crotch.

2101
02:48:03,834 --> 02:48:04,815
[SPEAKER_15]: And they're not funny.

2102
02:48:05,375 --> 02:48:06,476
[SPEAKER_15]: They're not funny.

2103
02:48:07,656 --> 02:48:10,217
[SPEAKER_15]: They're totally insanely not funny.

2104
02:48:11,078 --> 02:48:13,739
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I saw on a sale for DVD?

2105
02:48:14,059 --> 02:48:17,580
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like freaking America's Funniest Home Videos, like an entire season on DVD.

2106
02:48:17,620 --> 02:48:18,781
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, why would you buy this?

2107
02:48:18,941 --> 02:48:19,101
[SPEAKER_06]: Why?

2108
02:48:19,571 --> 02:48:23,575
[SPEAKER_15]: I know, they show it on PAX TV or like all those other channels, TNT.

2109
02:48:23,715 --> 02:48:24,696
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it on ABC?

2110
02:48:25,758 --> 02:48:26,699
[SPEAKER_15]: I think they still play it.

2111
02:48:26,719 --> 02:48:28,601
[SPEAKER_06]: Still hosted by Tom Bergeron now or whatever?

2112
02:48:28,921 --> 02:48:29,081
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

2113
02:48:29,101 --> 02:48:30,302
[SPEAKER_06]: The guy that was on Hollywood Squares?

2114
02:48:30,342 --> 02:48:31,363
[SPEAKER_06]: Better than Bob Saget.

2115
02:48:31,383 --> 02:48:32,425
[SPEAKER_06]: Is Hollywood Squares still on?

2116
02:48:33,586 --> 02:48:34,166
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think so.

2117
02:48:34,186 --> 02:48:34,927
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's too bad.

2118
02:48:35,408 --> 02:48:37,009
[SPEAKER_06]: Whoopi Goldberg was a cool center square.

2119
02:48:37,029 --> 02:48:38,411
[SPEAKER_06]: Just thought I'd share.

2120
02:48:38,531 --> 02:48:39,232
[SPEAKER_06]: Really like her?

2121
02:48:39,892 --> 02:48:40,273
[SPEAKER_06]: Not really.

2122
02:48:40,553 --> 02:48:40,633
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh.

2123
02:48:46,846 --> 02:48:53,024
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, what we're going to do now, I think we'll go to a quick break, and then when we come back, maybe Ask Orange Lounge for a little bit?

2124
02:48:53,897 --> 02:48:56,539
[SPEAKER_15]: Ask me anything Ask Orange Lounge Get your questions in now

2125
02:49:23,061 --> 02:49:37,462
[SPEAKER_10]: Dreamer Dreamer, take me in your dream Take me anywhere you please Boy, you're making me scream Dreamer Dreamer, life is just a dream If you wanna set me free Boy, you're making me scream Ooh, la-da-dee, la-da-dee

Hey, I like to dream, baby

2128
02:50:45,370 --> 02:50:50,354
[SPEAKER_06]: And just so you guys know, the only thing better than dream a dream is more dream a dream.

2129
02:50:55,818 --> 02:51:00,361
[SPEAKER_23]: Let's dream a dream together.

2130
02:51:02,043 --> 02:51:04,745
[SPEAKER_23]: A dream that is real.

2131
02:52:22,268 --> 02:52:26,150
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Lounge Radio, Mamani Music, and more.

2132
02:52:26,290 --> 02:52:27,971
[SPEAKER_11]: Pa-pa-pa-perfect!

2133
02:52:34,414 --> 02:52:35,674
[SPEAKER_06]: That's Sask Orange Lounge.

2134
02:52:36,255 --> 02:52:37,355
[SPEAKER_06]: Some stupid question.

2135
02:52:37,875 --> 02:52:41,097
[SPEAKER_06]: What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?

2136
02:52:41,577 --> 02:52:48,560
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm curious to see if Extover actually got any questions, but it would be nice if we would stop talking about Madonna for once.

2137
02:52:51,448 --> 02:52:53,329
[SPEAKER_15]: That was a laughing riot there.

2138
02:52:53,790 --> 02:52:55,771
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sure everybody just dropped everything they did.

2139
02:52:57,392 --> 02:53:01,896
[SPEAKER_15]: Exploding laughter.

2140
02:53:01,996 --> 02:53:05,498
[SPEAKER_05]: Rene wants to know, what will it take to get MidiHead on the show?

2141
02:53:06,539 --> 02:53:09,881
[SPEAKER_06]: And Sky, Mr. Moripovich would like to know, are you the father?

2142
02:53:12,924 --> 02:53:14,665
[SPEAKER_06]: The last time I had sex with a woman.

2143
02:53:16,186 --> 02:53:16,566
[SPEAKER_06]: Never mind.

2144
02:53:18,227 --> 02:53:18,848
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a kiss.

2145
02:53:19,976 --> 02:53:21,517
[SPEAKER_06]: What would it take to get MiniHead on the show?

2146
02:53:21,597 --> 02:53:28,522
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably if we just ask really nicely, and we do want to get him on the show sometime around the release time of Ultramix 3, so I look forward to it.

2147
02:53:28,602 --> 02:53:29,583
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure he'll do it.

2148
02:53:29,823 --> 02:53:31,525
[SPEAKER_06]: We just have to ask really nicely, so we will.

2149
02:53:31,865 --> 02:53:33,966
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll have our people talk to his people, and we'll let you guys know.

2150
02:53:35,087 --> 02:53:36,148
[SPEAKER_06]: Rini also wants to know...

2151
02:53:37,463 --> 02:53:41,946
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that promo with Something Something making Captain Jack cry getting retired?

2152
02:53:42,567 --> 02:53:43,628
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, we don't know yet.

2153
02:53:44,088 --> 02:53:44,748
[SPEAKER_06]: We think so.

2154
02:53:45,529 --> 02:53:48,831
[SPEAKER_06]: But we definitely don't want to retire Copy Kills Music, because that thing's awesome.

2155
02:53:49,492 --> 02:53:51,693
[SPEAKER_06]: But as far as the promo, you know what?

2156
02:53:51,833 --> 02:53:55,456
[SPEAKER_06]: All of our old promos really need to be retired, but we're just too lazy to make new ones.

2157
02:53:55,776 --> 02:53:57,457
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe we should have a promo making contest.

2158
02:53:57,477 --> 02:53:58,939
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe that's how we could get rid of this, uh...

2159
02:53:59,824 --> 02:54:00,544
[SPEAKER_06]: DDR Extreme 2.

2160
02:54:00,764 --> 02:54:01,745
[SPEAKER_06]: I wonder if people would do it.

2161
02:54:02,165 --> 02:54:02,505
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't know.

2162
02:54:02,525 --> 02:54:07,086
[SPEAKER_06]: Chatroom, would you guys make us promos if we gave away an Extreme 2 bundle?

2163
02:54:07,846 --> 02:54:09,026
[SPEAKER_06]: An official Konami softpad?

2164
02:54:10,587 --> 02:54:11,167
[SPEAKER_06]: That might be cool.

2165
02:54:13,167 --> 02:54:14,248
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's get to some more questions.

2166
02:54:19,269 --> 02:54:22,670
[SPEAKER_06]: Sakurina wants to know, is 69 easier with a hard-on?

2167
02:54:24,787 --> 02:54:25,447
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate the question.

2168
02:54:25,467 --> 02:54:28,269
[SPEAKER_06]: And yes, my advice would be that you have a hard-on when you do a 69.

2169
02:54:54,290 --> 02:54:59,935
[SPEAKER_06]: Legend of Zaku is wondering aloud in a question, are they going to bury Captain Jack in his trademark uniform?

2170
02:55:01,276 --> 02:55:02,977
[SPEAKER_06]: You always know there's got to be somebody thinking morbid.

2171
02:55:07,422 --> 02:55:09,804
[SPEAKER_06]: If I were Captain Jack, I would want to be buried in the uniform.

2172
02:55:10,044 --> 02:55:11,285
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they have to.

2173
02:55:11,585 --> 02:55:13,907
[SPEAKER_06]: When was he not in that uniform, honestly?

2174
02:55:14,548 --> 02:55:15,429
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they should.

2175
02:55:18,618 --> 02:55:21,800
[SPEAKER_15]: I love how everybody gets so mad when people ask me a question.

2176
02:55:22,360 --> 02:55:24,881
[SPEAKER_15]: Like I'm gonna, you know, take offense or something.

2177
02:55:25,562 --> 02:55:26,242
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, let's see.

2178
02:55:26,302 --> 02:55:30,645
[SPEAKER_06]: NintendoManiac64 wants to know, why am I eating cheddar Chex Mix instead of ranch Doritos?

2179
02:55:31,185 --> 02:55:32,185
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, because it's less fattening?

2180
02:55:32,285 --> 02:55:32,586
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

2181
02:55:33,126 --> 02:55:36,668
[SPEAKER_06]: Why are none of the awesome Mario Kart 64 tracks in Mario Kart DS?

2182
02:55:36,968 --> 02:55:42,151
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, because Nintendo will release Mario Kart DS Extreme or something that has the extra tracks in it later?

2183
02:55:42,211 --> 02:55:43,872
[SPEAKER_06]: Has Mario Kart DS even come out yet?

2184
02:55:44,092 --> 02:55:44,912
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

2185
02:55:45,453 --> 02:55:47,053
[SPEAKER_06]: How do you know they're not unlockables?

2186
02:55:47,334 --> 02:55:47,434
[SPEAKER_28]: Hmm?

2187
02:55:51,400 --> 02:55:54,822
[SPEAKER_06]: So, Loki, what did you exactly do with my foot last night?

2188
02:55:54,882 --> 02:55:57,304
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone in chat wants to hear your sick, perverted, gay thoughts.

2189
02:55:58,144 --> 02:56:00,445
[SPEAKER_06]: I have no idea what he's... That was like an hour ago on the show.

2190
02:56:00,465 --> 02:56:01,086
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't even remember.

2191
02:56:01,526 --> 02:56:04,088
[SPEAKER_06]: I wasn't even paying attention then.

2192
02:56:04,128 --> 02:56:07,770
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, any of you guys or chatroom folks go to... Beep!

2193
02:56:08,110 --> 02:56:09,231
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody's trying to hoard their website.

2194
02:56:09,611 --> 02:56:10,491
[SPEAKER_06]: Once it's complete.

2195
02:56:11,312 --> 02:56:13,353
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, complete it, and then we'll say the website.

2196
02:56:13,933 --> 02:56:15,054
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't even visited yet.

2197
02:56:15,114 --> 02:56:16,035
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll visit it.

2198
02:56:17,155 --> 02:56:17,816
[SPEAKER_06]: Send me an email.

2199
02:56:17,856 --> 02:56:18,676
[SPEAKER_06]: Ask me really nicely.

2200
02:56:18,716 --> 02:56:19,857
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll visit it and give you my opinion.

2201
02:56:21,587 --> 02:56:24,588
[SPEAKER_06]: Illusion wants to know, now what's it all about, Alfie?

2202
02:56:26,129 --> 02:56:28,270
[SPEAKER_06]: Seeing a good movie for a change would be my answer.

2203
02:56:28,610 --> 02:56:33,051
[SPEAKER_06]: A movie, yeah, Alfie sucked.

2204
02:56:36,053 --> 02:56:37,593
[SPEAKER_06]: It's lame, that's all you need to know.

2205
02:56:39,014 --> 02:56:41,175
[SPEAKER_06]: Lego Freak wants to know, hey buddy, can I have $100?

2206
02:56:41,215 --> 02:56:41,835
[SPEAKER_06]: Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.

2207
02:56:45,211 --> 02:56:51,173
[SPEAKER_06]: One day when we're rich and famous, we'll give away cash and fabulous prizes on the show, and we'll remember your support.

2208
02:57:09,315 --> 02:57:14,357
[SPEAKER_06]: Goggle wants to know, after no field trips the past three years, I have two coming up in the next two weeks.

2209
02:57:14,757 --> 02:57:20,098
[SPEAKER_06]: Should I go on both and risk missing work, or only go on one and get all my work done?

2210
02:57:20,458 --> 02:57:21,659
[SPEAKER_06]: It kind of depends where you're going.

2211
02:57:21,699 --> 02:57:23,679
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, are you going to the pumpkin patch?

2212
02:57:23,739 --> 02:57:25,960
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, if you're going to the pumpkin patch, fuck that shit.

2213
02:57:25,980 --> 02:57:27,621
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't need to go to the pumpkin patch.

2214
02:57:27,921 --> 02:57:33,182
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you're going to, like, I don't know, Hooters, then go.

2215
02:57:33,603 --> 02:57:34,223
[SPEAKER_15]: Then go.

2216
02:57:36,463 --> 02:57:38,264
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, if it's to Canada, I would go to Canada.

2217
02:57:39,424 --> 02:57:45,729
[SPEAKER_06]: Duran wants to know, I need an NES, can I have yours?

2218
02:57:57,543 --> 02:57:58,763
[SPEAKER_06]: My NES is broken.

2219
02:57:59,163 --> 02:58:05,025
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it won't even play the cartridges after I blow on them like there's no tomorrow.

2220
02:58:06,925 --> 02:58:08,265
[SPEAKER_06]: My NES just don't work no more.

2221
02:58:08,325 --> 02:58:11,886
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you want a broken paperweight, I guess you could have that.

2222
02:58:14,067 --> 02:58:16,367
[SPEAKER_26]: No one ever asks me any questions.

2223
02:58:17,348 --> 02:58:19,288
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you want to give your NES to Duran?

2224
02:58:20,439 --> 02:58:25,704
[SPEAKER_26]: No, I actually have the one that top loads, if you remember that one.

2225
02:58:25,724 --> 02:58:26,324
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, lucky you.

2226
02:58:27,125 --> 02:58:29,367
[SPEAKER_26]: And I have the original as well.

2227
02:58:30,848 --> 02:58:32,570
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes, they work, and no, you can't have them.

2228
02:58:34,071 --> 02:58:36,193
[SPEAKER_26]: Otherwise, I can't play Guardian Legends, so there.

2229
02:58:39,469 --> 02:58:41,490
[SPEAKER_06]: Goggle wanted to clarify the two field trips.

2230
02:58:41,550 --> 02:58:44,591
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a museum on one day and a play on the other.

2231
02:58:45,712 --> 02:58:46,412
[SPEAKER_06]: Go to the play.

2232
02:58:47,172 --> 02:58:48,953
[SPEAKER_06]: I think both are worth it, and here's why.

2233
02:58:48,993 --> 02:58:57,136
[SPEAKER_06]: The museum, you're going to see nudity at the museum, because in classic arts, there's going to be nudity, and in sculptures and stuff, usually there's a naked one or two, like a bust.

2234
02:58:57,156 --> 02:58:59,397
[SPEAKER_06]: Artistic nudity is not that great.

2235
02:58:59,537 --> 02:59:00,238
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but it's nudity.

2236
02:59:00,578 --> 02:59:04,161
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you should see the play, because there's a chance of nudity, depending on what the play is.

2237
02:59:04,461 --> 02:59:07,583
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, if it's a little G-rated musical, like The Lion King, forget it.

2238
02:59:07,904 --> 02:59:10,305
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, if it's something else, like, you know, hair?

2239
02:59:10,345 --> 02:59:11,406
[SPEAKER_15]: You don't even need nudity.

2240
02:59:11,466 --> 02:59:15,269
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, if they're wearing tights, you're going to see their package.

2241
02:59:16,170 --> 02:59:23,916
[SPEAKER_15]: So, I mean, you know, if you see penal structure behind that, you know, tight that the guy's... Goggle, go where the nudity is.

2242
02:59:24,056 --> 02:59:26,198
[SPEAKER_06]: That's my advice, my sound advice to you.

2243
02:59:30,394 --> 02:59:31,154
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, that's it.

2244
02:59:31,314 --> 02:59:31,715
[SPEAKER_06]: We're done.

2245
02:59:31,935 --> 02:59:32,695
[SPEAKER_06]: We're done with this show.

2246
02:59:33,696 --> 02:59:34,997
[SPEAKER_06]: Put the nail in the coffin of the show.

2247
02:59:35,037 --> 02:59:35,337
[SPEAKER_06]: We're done.

2248
02:59:35,657 --> 02:59:38,879
[SPEAKER_15]: I was pretty PG-13 tonight, wouldn't you say so, Rob Roberts?

2249
02:59:38,899 --> 02:59:41,941
[SPEAKER_06]: You did a fairly good job, extrovert extroverson.

2250
02:59:45,876 --> 02:59:46,957
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what else to call you.

2251
02:59:47,437 --> 02:59:48,798
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't have a stage last name yet.

2252
02:59:48,838 --> 02:59:49,378
[SPEAKER_06]: You need one.

2253
02:59:49,718 --> 02:59:50,699
[SPEAKER_15]: It's going to be Extifer.

2254
02:59:51,840 --> 02:59:55,362
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's going to be on the show tomorrow.

2255
02:59:56,182 --> 02:59:57,223
[SPEAKER_15]: Rob, pitch my show.

2256
02:59:58,363 --> 03:00:00,084
[SPEAKER_06]: Listen to the Rob Roberts show on Wednesday.

2257
03:00:00,144 --> 03:00:00,825
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be a good time.

2258
03:00:01,025 --> 03:00:01,565
[SPEAKER_06]: Shut the fuck up.

2259
03:00:01,945 --> 03:00:02,866
[SPEAKER_15]: Pitch the real show.

2260
03:00:02,986 --> 03:00:03,506
[SPEAKER_06]: Shut the fuck up!

2261
03:00:03,626 --> 03:00:04,186
[SPEAKER_15]: Shut the fuck up!

2262
03:00:09,009 --> 03:00:09,549
[SPEAKER_06]: Final thoughts.

2263
03:00:10,690 --> 03:00:11,551
[SPEAKER_06]: Angel, your final thought.

2264
03:00:15,171 --> 03:00:17,192
[SPEAKER_26]: I want to go home and play World of Warcraft.

2265
03:00:17,812 --> 03:00:18,072
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh!

2266
03:00:19,453 --> 03:00:20,874
[SPEAKER_06]: Extra for your final thought.

2267
03:00:20,894 --> 03:00:21,734
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, damn, you didn't say it.

2268
03:00:21,754 --> 03:00:22,254
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I'm sorry.

2269
03:00:22,874 --> 03:00:23,375
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, addict?

2270
03:00:23,495 --> 03:00:25,416
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's reserved for Final Fantasy XI.

2271
03:00:25,436 --> 03:00:26,856
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll think of another word for World of Warcraft.

2272
03:00:28,557 --> 03:00:29,457
[SPEAKER_06]: Extra for your final thought.

2273
03:00:30,738 --> 03:00:32,859
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to go home and play World of Warcraft.

2274
03:00:34,160 --> 03:00:34,780
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh!

2275
03:00:35,820 --> 03:00:37,361
[SPEAKER_10]: But you're already home!

2276
03:00:40,803 --> 03:00:43,544
[SPEAKER_06]: He's going to come over to your house, and that will be like the worst thing ever.

2277
03:00:43,564 --> 03:00:43,604
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

2278
03:00:45,003 --> 03:00:45,383
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki!

2279
03:00:48,064 --> 03:00:56,447
[SPEAKER_06]: Um... I hope this works... And... It doesn't work.

2280
03:00:56,527 --> 03:00:57,087
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it doesn't.

2281
03:00:57,187 --> 03:00:57,408
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

2282
03:00:58,708 --> 03:00:59,288
[SPEAKER_06]: Son of a bitch.

2283
03:00:59,388 --> 03:01:05,971
[SPEAKER_06]: By the way, I'd just like to point out that we've actually been short two hosts tonight, because DarkSakura isn't here, and Loki has just really not been involved in the show.

2284
03:01:05,991 --> 03:01:09,432
[SPEAKER_06]: He's been working on something for the site the whole night, so he could care less about this show.

2285
03:01:10,260 --> 03:01:12,381
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm participating.

2286
03:01:12,581 --> 03:01:15,702
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki does not care about Orange Lounge people.

2287
03:01:18,323 --> 03:01:19,723
[SPEAKER_06]: I goddamn hate PHP.

2288
03:01:21,004 --> 03:01:21,244
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

2289
03:01:22,724 --> 03:01:25,225
[SPEAKER_06]: My final thought is I want to top loading NES now.

2290
03:01:25,805 --> 03:01:26,226
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm jealous.

2291
03:01:26,286 --> 03:01:29,027
[SPEAKER_26]: I can bring mine over and you can play games if you want.

2292
03:01:29,047 --> 03:01:29,567
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have Kid Icarus?

2293
03:01:31,894 --> 03:01:32,575
[SPEAKER_26]: It ain't worth it.

2294
03:01:32,695 --> 03:01:34,055
[SPEAKER_15]: If you don't have Kid Icarus, it ain't worth it.

2295
03:01:34,075 --> 03:01:36,797
[SPEAKER_26]: Magus might, so yes.

2296
03:01:37,057 --> 03:01:39,478
[SPEAKER_15]: Why is that game so wonderful?

2297
03:01:39,618 --> 03:01:41,019
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it's Kid Icarus, motherfucker.

2298
03:01:41,039 --> 03:01:44,081
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, it was the fucking hardest game that I played when I played it.

2299
03:01:44,101 --> 03:01:44,281
[SPEAKER_15]: I beat it.

2300
03:01:44,361 --> 03:01:45,462
[SPEAKER_15]: I beat it because I'm the shit.

2301
03:01:46,442 --> 03:01:47,363
[SPEAKER_15]: You are the shit.

2302
03:01:48,543 --> 03:01:49,444
[SPEAKER_15]: Keep going with that, Rob.

2303
03:01:50,284 --> 03:01:54,446
[SPEAKER_15]: But meanwhile, I still think that it was kind of difficult.

2304
03:01:54,626 --> 03:01:57,268
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe it was just because I'm not video game prone or something.

2305
03:01:57,288 --> 03:01:57,448
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe.

2306
03:01:58,004 --> 03:01:58,524
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe that's it.

2307
03:01:59,365 --> 03:02:00,765
[SPEAKER_15]: I beat Legend of Zelda.

2308
03:02:01,466 --> 03:02:01,826
[SPEAKER_15]: Good job.

2309
03:02:02,186 --> 03:02:03,047
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, no problem.

2310
03:02:03,067 --> 03:02:04,627
[SPEAKER_15]: Did you beat the second quest, though?

2311
03:02:04,928 --> 03:02:05,408
[SPEAKER_15]: I did.

2312
03:02:05,948 --> 03:02:06,448
[SPEAKER_15]: I did beat it.

2313
03:02:06,468 --> 03:02:06,648
[SPEAKER_06]: Good job.

2314
03:02:06,689 --> 03:02:07,549
[SPEAKER_15]: Did you beat Zelda 2?

2315
03:02:08,489 --> 03:02:09,810
[SPEAKER_15]: I didn't.

2316
03:02:10,150 --> 03:02:11,071
[SPEAKER_06]: You suck!

2317
03:02:11,571 --> 03:02:12,031
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

2318
03:02:13,572 --> 03:02:14,753
[SPEAKER_06]: Final word of the show.

2319
03:02:14,953 --> 03:02:16,494
[SPEAKER_06]: One word to sum it all up.

2320
03:02:16,774 --> 03:02:17,374
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob Roberts?

2321
03:02:17,634 --> 03:02:17,814
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

2322
03:02:18,795 --> 03:02:19,955
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, do I get to give the final word?

2323
03:02:19,975 --> 03:02:21,356
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe you do, because you never do.

2324
03:02:21,376 --> 03:02:23,577
[SPEAKER_06]: I never do do the final word of the show.

2325
03:02:23,597 --> 03:02:24,978
[SPEAKER_06]: Goddammit, do the final word of the show.

2326
03:02:24,998 --> 03:02:26,699
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, here's the final word of tonight's show.

2327
03:02:33,109 --> 03:02:37,970
[SPEAKER_33]: That does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live.

2328
03:02:38,791 --> 03:02:42,992
[SPEAKER_33]: Orange Lounge Radio Live is an Orange Lounge Radio production.
