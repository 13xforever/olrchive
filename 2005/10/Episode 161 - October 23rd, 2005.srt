00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,860
My curves on the left side and likes on the right.

14
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,680
We're singing viva la vida!

15
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:19,380
Ay yi yi yi Viva la vida

00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:25,880
My girl's on the left side, back on the right We're shaking, it's Viva la vida

17
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:34,080
I woke up tonight, some silver in light From somewhere I heard music playing

18
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:41,480
The party the people were clanging And what I saw made me believing

19
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:45,480
We dance through the night, the stars shining bright

20
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,480
And the silence of cool margaritas

21
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,480
All over him like seÃ±oritas

22
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,480
The rising sun shines and we're singing

23
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,480
Ay yi yi yi

24
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:02,480
Viva la vina

25
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,480
Some curves on the left side and backs on the right

26
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,480
We're singing in viva la vina

27
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:16,480
Ayayaya, Viva La Vida

28
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,480
The girls on the left side, the blacks on the right

29
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,480
We're singing and here I come, here I come

30
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:56,480
His hands warm and fine, these boys should be mine

31
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,480
His lungs made me feel like a chili

32
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:02,480
His body, his shoulders, his willies

33
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,480
And everything, he is the biggest

34
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:09,480
He asked for a walk, he's stolen my heart

35
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,480
And he held me tight, made me study

36
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,480
Like his son and sweat on his body

37
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:20,480
This body dance moves like no other

38
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:23,480
Ay yi yi yi

39
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:26,480
Viva la vida

40
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:30,480
Five girls on the left side and next on the right

41
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:33,480
We're singing in Viva la vida

42
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:37,480

00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:37,540
with it had such a fun little dance to it and people would kind of the lyrics

90
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:42,260
kind of have you like sing along with it and do a little dance and it was really

91
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:46,660
cheesy and we all look drunk and stupid but um you know what Captain Jack songs

00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:38,760
This DDS stops, Holla, Duh-duh-duh, the Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

183
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,760
That's right, DDS!

184
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:43,760
DTPO!

185
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:48,760
Welcome back, kids. We're here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 161.

186
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:51,760
In that break, we heard Only You by Captain Jack from DDR4thMix

187
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,760
and Captain Jack with Holiday the Radio Mix.

188
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:59,760
Tonight, of course, we played a couple of long versions there, which we don't usually do during our breaks.

189
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:03,580
but tonight I think we have an excuse to be a little bit different, so there you have

190
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:09,420
it. I promised our chat room, which by the way is swinging tonight, over at www.orangelaungeradio.com

191
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:13,460
clicking on chat, I promised them that we would have a major announcement regarding

192
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:18,540
interactivity and the show a little bit before the program started, and I'm going to reveal

193
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:26,120
that right now. Here's the big news. As you know, we have the Skype line that allows you

194
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:30,380
to contact us, you know, and we can talk to you on air.

195
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:33,060
But sometimes we have a lot of problems with the Skype line with people like being able

196
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:36,740
to talk to us. They can't hear us or we can't hear them.

197
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:41,140
And there's the Internet lag or something's going on, so it acts really funny.

198
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:47,980
So what we've done, excuse me, I'm burping here because I just had Sprite during the

199
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:51,700
break. And that's the worst McDonald's french fries

200
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:55,060
verb there. Anyway, so what we did is we've actually purchased

201
00:17:55,060 --> 00:18:00,820
an add-on to Skype that will allow you to call us on a regular telephone and say hello

202
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:01,820
to us.

203
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:05,180
So here's the thing though, not only is it a regular phone so you can give us a call

204
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:08,380
and talk to us, but it's also a message line.

205
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:11,780
So if you want to call and leave us a message at any time, you can, and we can play that

206
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:12,780
on the show.

207
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:16,580
So we thought, with the news regarding Captain Jack, and I'm sure a lot of people have something

208
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:20,060
they want to say, we thought we could open up this brand new thing and allow you guys

209
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:24,060
to call in right now, leave some messages, and we'll play them later in the show.

210
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:28,780
course now guys try to keep it you know it is a three-hour show so we're kind of

211
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:33,020
looking for you know what's your feedback on how did you react to the

212
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:38,480
news how was Captain Jack influential to DDR was he the reason you played was you

213
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,580
know he just fun whatever you want to say we've got a line for you guys here

214
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:46,500
is the number it's not an 800 number you guys so you want to ask mommy or daddy

215
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,860
before you call because it might be a long-distance number it's area code 9 1

216
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:56,260
916-226-9067 is the brand new Orange Lounge Radio message line.

217
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,260
That's 916-226-9067.

218
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:03,060
It's open right now if you want to call in and leave us a message.

219
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:07,820
We do not have, we're not taking live calls at this time, we'll do that later in the show,

220
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:11,540
and when we take live calls, you will actually be able to call in with a number if you want

221
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:12,540
as well.

222
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:15,340
You don't just have to, you got to be careful with that mic extra for it's got like a feedback

223
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:16,340
thing.

224
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:20,380
So you don't just have to have Skype to call in, you can actually call us using a regular

225
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:24,340
telephone as long as you're cool with paying long distance charges.

226
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:28,380
Or use a cell phone because you've got all those minutes, free long distance.

227
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:29,380
Exactly.

228
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:30,380
Exactly.

229
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:38,340
Alright, so once again the phone number, area code 916-226-9067.

230
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:40,340
And I'm putting that in chat right now.

231
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,340
916-226-9067.

232
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:48,100
90-67. Anyway, um, before we get into how was your week, how was your day, obviously

233
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:53,300
the big, uh, pink elephant sitting in the room right now is, uh, Extifer, no, um, is

234
00:19:53,300 --> 00:20:00,100
the fact that, um, Captain Jack obviously passed away this week, um, which, um, you

235
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:06,140
know, sucks. How else do you say it sucks? Um, he suffered a second stroke, apparently

236
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:09,860
he had a stroke, um, a couple years ago, and he had a second stroke, and when he suffered

237
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:13,180
the second stroke apparently he was at a party in full uniform because I don't

238
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:16,900
think a picture of Captain Jack exists where he was not in his full uniform

239
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:21,300
which is part of what made him so awesome but unfortunately he did suffer

240
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:24,380
a second stroke and it caused him to go into a coma which we posted about

241
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:28,460
earlier in the week and unfortunately led to his death a little later on in

242
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:31,960
the week and he was 43 when he passed away which is kind of a young age so

243
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:36,940
it's really too bad. He is survived by an ex-wife and a son, son's 21 years old I

244
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:40,940
I believe living in Miami? Something like that?

245
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:44,940
So, anyway, I thought maybe we could go around before we do a little bit of How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day,

246
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:48,940
and what do you think about all of it? What did you think of Captain Jack? What do you think about

247
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:52,940
Captain Jack and DDR? What do you think about the music?

248
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:56,940
Anything you guys want to say? And we'll start it off with Loki.

249
00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:00,940
Well, I was surprised to hear they had passed away.

250
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:04,940
Because I remember the whole morning I was trying to see what his condition

251
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:09,900
was, and a lot of people were, because they were getting sources from a German site, so

252
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:15,060
translating German we weren't sure if it was, you know, still in coma, or passed away, or

253
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:18,700
just like, you know. So once he figured it out, you know, and the news hit everybody,

254
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:26,700
you know, it was, you know, very surprising, that's for sure. The guy's, I don't know,

255
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:32,700
I wasn't a particular fan of his music, I mean, he was in the category of songs that

256
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:37,080
they're quite annoying to be played over and over and over in DDR so it wasn't

257
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:41,840
bad but it wasn't you know he wasn't as horrible say like you know DJ Alligator

258
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:46,640
or something like that so it was still fun his songs were fun and he's just I

259
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:51,660
mean he's definitely stayed true to himself I mean he's just very you know

260
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:57,740
out there you know not change the way he was you know just because of whatever I

261
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:01,740
I mean, he was definitely strange, that's for sure.

262
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:04,380
But yeah, it sucks that he's not going to be around.

263
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:08,740
But I'm sure we're still going to hear his music in DDR.

264
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:11,580
In fact, probably more so now that he's gone.

265
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:14,180
So yeah, it's good.

266
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:18,220
But that's life.

267
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:19,980
Angel, anything you want to say about it?

268
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:22,500
Who, by the way, was joining us there during the opening music

269
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,020
there.

270
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:23,420
Hi, Angel.

271
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:23,920
Hi.

272
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:24,420
Hi.

273
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:27,720
Anything you want to say about Captain Jack?

274
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:34,040
oh well let's see it the first time i played it or it yeah any song by him i guess um

275
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:40,120
i think and now correct me if i'm wrong it was like i don't know i was like at scandia

276
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:48,840
back in the bay area there and uh we were playing it on a second third mix duo thing yeah i'm not

277
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:53,960
quite sure on that but i think so so that's the first time that i ever played one of his songs

278
00:22:53,960 --> 00:23:00,200
and you know I still like him and you know good stuff and I'm sorry to hear

279
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:05,040
that he did pass away this week that was kind of a shocker actually DJ I want to

280
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:10,400
run the s one of our buddies told me on aim we were like talking and stuff and

281
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:15,320
he was like hey did you hear my what huh so he like linked me to it and to the

282
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:19,920
website that was announcing that he was in a coma and stuff it's just sad huh

283
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:29,640
I kind of see Captain Jack as one of like the three big artists in the beginnings of

284
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:34,560
DDR, the other two being Smile DK and Erotic, because like those three bands kind of showed

285
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:40,720
up in every early mix and continue to show up in a lot of DDR mixes today.

286
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:48,220
And where Smile DK is kind of bubblegum, pop girl stuff, and Erotic is, I don't know what

287
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:52,440
the hell you call erotic. Captain Jack is quite simply the shit. Captain Jack is the

288
00:23:52,440 --> 00:24:00,320
shit. He's the man. I mean, a little bit eccentric, yes, but that's cool because his music was

289
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:06,020
just a lot of dumb fun and I know, and that's kind of what DDR is all about. DDR is kind

290
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:12,120
of dumb fun. And so Captain Jack, you know, he just wants to be surrounded by hot bitches

291
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:16,960
and dance. That's really what Captain Jack was all about, was hot bitches and dancing.

292
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:22,720
And you know, I think that's awesome. And that's just what DDR is all about, is having

293
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,880
fun, and I think that's what Captain Jack's music was all about, is fun. Is it ever gonna

294
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:33,520
win a Grammy? No. Is it, you know, the Oscar-winning soundtrack music? No. Is it even critically

295
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:40,400
acclaimed ever? No. It's just, it's fun, mindless, happy, bouncy music, and that's what DDR is

296
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,280
all about. So that's why Captain Jack's the man.

297
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:50,120
What made it ironic about the whole thing was last week after the show I decided to

298
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:59,500
go out in the living room and play EX2 for the first time and the song that's on there

299
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:04,660
was one of the first ones I actually played so hearing what happened earlier this week

300
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:06,440
I was like what?

301
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:12,080
So, I don't know, it's just kind of, kind of, well, yeah, like I said, ironic, so...

302
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,080
I don't know.

303
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,080
It was just weird.

304
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,080
It's like, wait.

305
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:20,040
XFR, I would ask you, but I know you don't play enough DDR to probably even know who

306
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,040
Gavin Jack is, or...

307
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,040
The guy that died?

308
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,040
Yeah, he...

309
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,040
I'm guessing.

310
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,040
Yes, he is the guy that died this week.

311
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,040
Oh, okay.

312
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,040
Um, my condolences.

313
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,040
Okay, yeah.

314
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,040
Well, you know...

315
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,040
Et cetera.

316
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:33,680
You know, it's, it's pretty interesting how the Bomani community and the music gaming

317
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,440
community in general has kind of been responding.

318
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:40,720
I know the article that Loki posted on it, I don't know if it made the run-arounds and

319
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:46,320
blogs and stuff, but the story about Captain Jack's passing has had more hits than anything

320
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,720
ever on our website.

321
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:52,040
I mean, it's something like 1,800 hits and counting for that story.

322
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,040
It's amazing.

323
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:58,080
And then, of course, on DDR Freak, you have the largest message board for music gaming.

324
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:01,280
You have the folks that are putting the little triangles in their signature that look like

325
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,280
the little black ribbon.

326
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:09,280
I think that's kind of interesting, and you just really see in the thread about Captain Jack passing on,

327
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:13,280
you really see just a lot of people talking about how, you know what, Captain Jack music was just fun,

328
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:17,280
and it was stuff that got me up on the machine and just got me into the game and got me into playing DDR,

329
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:22,280
and it's just really sad to kind of see that there won't be more Captain Jack music.

330
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:28,280
I mean, Captain Jack music and DDR, yes, maybe, but Captain Jack music, new stuff in general, no.

331
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,280
So it's just kind of too bad.

332
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:40,280
And another thing I could point out is, you know, you often wonder, you know, if I ever pass away, will people, you know, find out about it and stuff like that?

333
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:46,280
And I wonder if he wondered the same thing, because now look at the response after, you know, he passed away and stuff, and so...

334
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:54,280
Kind of interesting. I bet no record company here in this country had any idea how big of a following Captain Jagger really had in this country.

335
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,720
You know, it's kind of amazing. So

336
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,680
Huh? I don't know what else to say

337
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:04,160
I don't want to turn this into a three-hour sob fest because honestly it's not we're all about that's not what Captain Jack was all

338
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:09,960
About so yeah, he wants just a party. So let's like we're not gonna have a funeral

339
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,960
I was saying in the chat room earlier tonight. We're not gonna have a funeral. We're gonna have a funeral

340
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:18,480
Yeah with hot bitches with hot bitches that's because that's that's what Captain Jack was all about with hot bitches

341
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,800
What okay hot female dogs? Okay. Yeah. Yeah

342
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:25,800
Release the dogs. Release the hounds.

343
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:32,800
Alright, again if you want to call and leave a message on our message line, it's 916-226-9067

344
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:37,800
and we'll be playing some of your messages and your thoughts about Captain Jack a little later in the program.

345
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:43,800
What else do I want to say on the whole thing? Oh yes, of course we had some requests

346
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:50,800
if we could maybe play a little something and just kind of give Captain Jack an appropriate

347
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:56,880
21 gun salute. So we're going to give Captain Jack a 21 gun salute, or as somebody suggested

348
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:03,720
in the chat room actually, a 21 arrow salute. So however you want to imagine it, this is

349
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:06,440
we're going to give Captain Jack a moment of silence, an orange launch radio moment

350
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:11,520
of silence, and a 21 gun salute. So if you would all please, a moment of silence and

351
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:18,520
a salute.

352
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:48,520
and to that you know Captain Jack would have followed up with

353
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,840
gooooo left go right go left go left go right go left

354
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:55,920
the sex on the right

355
00:28:55,920 --> 00:29:00,080
those little words I picked up on when you were playing

356
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:03,320
the vita la vita song we were playing for the show?

357
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:07,280
live in la vita loca? no not really

358
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:11,360
let's get into orange lounge radio and what we're all about

359
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,840
Hello kids who are listening to us, maybe for the first time.

360
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:19,040
We're just a radio program about the music games and video gaming in general,

361
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,800
but sometimes we like to talk about ourselves.

362
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:24,280
It's kind of like, imagine if you were going out to Denny's

363
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:26,000
after the football game.

364
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,560
Sure, you talk about the football game a little bit,

365
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,760
but you talk about other stuff too.

366
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,160
And that's what we're all about here at Orange Lounge,

367
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,680
just sitting around having a good time.

368
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:35,320
So one way we just kind of do that is by talking about our weeks and our days.

369
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:38,120
So we're going to talk about your week and your day and what's been up

370
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:38,800
and what's been going on.

371
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:42,800
We'll start off tonight with DDR Angel, if you wouldn't mind starting us off. How was your week? How was your day?

372
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:54,800
Sure, that's not a problem. Yeah. Well, the week was alright. I spent Monday and Tuesday kind of trying to get my computer back online and stuff like that.

373
00:29:54,800 --> 00:30:05,280
like that. I finally got to that point at early Wednesday morning before class and so

374
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:12,480
that's all fine and good now and I can finally play all the games that I want to play. Today

375
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:17,980
was pretty much spent catching up on all the Warcraft because I hadn't done it all week

376
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:24,400
thanks to said computer. Other than that I picked up EX2 this week. I haven't gotten

377
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:31,400
to play it yet, but I shall get to that shortly. Other than that, it's been a really quiet

378
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:38,840
week. Oh, I picked up a... People are going to shoot me for this, but I ended up going

379
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:45,840
to the bookstore and stumbling upon a Warcraft manga. So I was like...

380
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,840
Nerd! Nerd!

381
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,560
I was like, hey, this is cool. Yeah, yeah, yeah, shut up.

382
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:59,560
Warcraft manga nerd hey I don't know I said I was like okay I'm mine so let's

383
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:04,080
see let's see the story let's see the world of war I know this isn't World of

384
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:09,960
Warcraft this is yeah oh it is I think World of Warcraft the Sunwell trilogy

385
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:15,320
it's an epic quest to save the world of Azeroth from the forces of the undead

386
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:21,680
Scourge. Warcraft the Sudwell Trilogy chronicles the adventures of Kalec, a blue

387
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:27,920
dragon who has taken human form to investigate a mysterious power. And

388
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:36,900
Anvina, a beautiful young maiden with an enchanting secret. Ooh. And volume number

389
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:41,980
two will be added in March of 2006. So that's a sex novel then, huh? No, it's not a sex

390
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:48,980
novel. Oh, okay. Oh, dear. What did I walk into? Oh, wait. Actually, yeah, so I bought

391
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:55,540
that and he caught in a go. Yeah, I bought all those, too, but you've probably done that.

392
00:31:55,540 --> 00:32:02,540
Oh, go read Tone and Jump. Jeez. Okay. Yeah, well, it's in there. Anyway, yeah, I bought

393
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:08,700
manga this week. Okay, anyway. It's all good. It's all good. Whatever you're into. What?

394
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:15,700
My Japanese says cries for, um, books and stuff.

395
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:18,700
Okay, uh, I don't know.

396
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:19,700
I guess that's it.

397
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:20,700
All right.

398
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:22,700
Uh, Loki, how was your week?

399
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:24,700
How was your day?

400
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:27,700
Um, my week was okay.

401
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:36,700
Um, I played other games and worked on the websites.

402
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:37,700
That's about it.

403
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:39,700
I ate steak today.

404
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:42,700
Steak? What kind of steak?

405
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:46,700
Just steak at Tahoe Joe's.

406
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:48,700
How big was this steak?

407
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:49,700
Six ounces.

408
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:50,700
Was it a big slab of meat?

409
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,700
No, because we had to do the...

410
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:56,700
We did the meal thing, so you get appetizers, bread, and soup and stuff.

411
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:59,700
So it's like, by the time you get to the actual steak, it's like, I'm full.

412
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,700
How do you enjoy your slabs of meat?

413
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:04,700
Medium. Or medium rare.

414
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:05,700
Yeah.

415
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:06,700
Me too.

416
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:13,700
Anyways, so no, that's pretty much all I did was play The Warriors this week, and I love that game.

417
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:20,700
There's nothing more fun than a game that starts off with beating up bums, and you know, hitting them with bricks and stuff,

418
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:25,700
and then they mug somebody by throwing a TV at their head and knocked them down and then stole their money.

419
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:28,700
That's just, that's great gameplay right there.

420
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:31,700
So, yep, that's what happened.

421
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:33,700
Okay, okay.

422
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:35,700
Well, I guess that's it then.

423
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:37,700
Exover, how was your week? How was your day?

424
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:39,700
It was good.

425
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:41,700
I worked a lot.

426
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:47,700
I played a lot of World of Warcraft, and I played some Final Fantasy XI.

427
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,700
Addict.

428
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:55,700
My sister came over yesterday and hung out with me and you, Sky.

429
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:59,380
and we all, like, hung out and stuff

430
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:03,260
and ate at Claim Jumper, which is a popular restaurant over here

431
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:06,580
and today

432
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:10,860
I kind of have, well actually, you know, this week I've also been preparing for

433
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:11,500
tomorrow's

434
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:15,540
show. Listen to it.

435
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:18,660
Starts tomorrow. What's it called? What time's it on?

436
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:22,660
The first case of the Monday starts at seven and

437
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:30,500
PST. PST. Meaning Pacific Standard Time. Not Please Sentel. Not Please Sentel.

438
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:38,740
So you know, listen and stuff. I'm planning on it lasting for two hours. Who knows, though.

439
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:44,540
It may last less than that. I'm just planning on it being kind of like a fun, random show.

440
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:50,500
Start off your week. And I love my intro song. Love it, love it. I can't stop talking about

441
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:52,500
I'm almost obsessed with it.

442
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:55,020
So are you going to be sad if no one listens?

443
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:59,180
Um, no, yes, well possibly.

444
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:02,300
I figure either way, no matter what, it's got to have higher ratings than Diversion

445
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,300
did.

446
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:04,300
So...

447
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:12,140
Well, just listen, give it a chance, be objective, it's not going to be all sex, it'll be more

448
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:13,140
than that.

449
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:14,140
Okay.

450
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:17,740
Although I'd enjoy if you just, you know, take off your pants when you listen to it.

451
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:18,740
Okay.

452
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:20,740
PG-13, I'm still PG-13.

453
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:54,500
remember kids don't drink and drive I didn't and I've been playing a lot of

454
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:58,620
World of Warcraft myself this week which I know it makes me a huge ass hypocrite

455
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:04,580
but no I don't go by books okay I don't go by the manga I'm just kidding I'm

456
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:08,940
kidding it's cool but I've just been you know trying to get into it and seeing

457
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:14,860
how I like it compared to the other MMOs out there and other than that I haven't

458
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:19,900
been doing a whole lot of things of interest. I did watch the season premieres of South

459
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:25,980
Park and Drawn Together, though, which were excellent. We should have listened! We should

460
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:30,580
have listened! Go around the ends and say, trick or treat, and you, like, get turned

461
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:35,020
into stuff. I know, I got turned into a ninja. I got turned into a bat. That was kind of

462
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:39,220
interesting. I got turned into a skeleton. Although, I really think that the Halloween

463
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:44,300
stuff in World of Warcraft is way better than Final Fantasy XI. Like, it can't stand the

464
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:47,220
the Final Fantasy XI thing, it just sucked.

465
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:50,400
I'm going to talk about this on the podcast a little later, but I don't want to compare

466
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,900
Final Fantasy XI and World of Warcraft.

467
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:52,900
But you know what?

468
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:56,240
I can compare those two because they're both having Halloween events.

469
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,240
So you know...

470
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,240
Yeah.

471
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,240
Alright.

472
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:00,240
That's fine.

473
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,240
Alright.

474
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,240
Let's see.

475
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:05,920
I think what we'll do now is we're going to take a little bit of a break, then we're going

476
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:09,200
to come back and we're going to talk about some Bahmani news, some things going on in

477
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,200
the Bahmani world.

478
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,560
So, let's see.

479
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:14,160
What do we want to do this break?

480
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:19,200
I think we'll do another Captain Jack song, although I think we'll keep it to shorter

481
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,280
versions this time.

482
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:25,080
And we'll be back after this break with more Orange Lodge Radio.

483
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,360
Don't forget you can call our message line.

484
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:30,100
We're going to get into the message line in probably about another 30 minutes or so.

485
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:33,340
So make sure you get all your messages in about Captain Jack.

486
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:38,120
Area code 9162269067.

487
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:40,520
Remember it's a three hour show, so keep your messages short.

488
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:43,360
We can't guarantee we'll get to all the messages as well.

489
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:48,040
just, you know, give it a call. And we'll be back after this with more Orange

490
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:55,040
lounge radio.

491
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:21,040
Now you're the last girl on the run

492

You feel the best to be the one

493
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:28,040
Come on and join the journey

494
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:32,040
This is the journey into time

495
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:35,040
As all the wheels are turning

496
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:39,040
Race is on the run

497
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,040
Are you ready?

498
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,040
Ready for the race

499
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,040
Are you ready?

500
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,040
Are you ready?

501
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:51,040
Ready for the Rex. Are you ready?

502
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,040
Are you ready?

503
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:04,040
Are you ready?

504
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,040
Are you ready?

505
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,040
Are you ready?

506
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,040

Are you ready?

509
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,040
My generation

510
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:52,040
I am an inspiration to the whole generation.

511
00:39:52,040 --> 00:40:08,520
I throw your hands up I throw your hands up I throw your hands up get em' up high

512
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:16,280
I throw your hands up I throw your hands up I throw your hands up get em' up high

513
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:48,280
I can't believe it, I can't believe it

514
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,280
My generation

515
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,280
And the baby

516
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,280
We watching

517
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,280
And the baby

518
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,280
We watching

519
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,280
And the baby

520
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,280
We never felt the same

521
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:33,120
We want you, we want you, we want you and the cast is crew

522
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:39,120
Pray to you, my precious, that you will be treasured by my entomology

523
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:46,120
Pray me to begin to make you feel no puncture on the world of harmony

524
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:53,120
Pray to you, that you will fly away from the sin that was brought to your heart to see

525
00:41:54,120 --> 00:42:00,120
Stand up for the peace and open in the presence of the sin that was brought to me

526
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:37,120
Let's go, let's go, right go pick up, let's go, let's go, right go later

527
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:53,120
Hey yo, Captain Jack, bring me back to the way we're tracked

528
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:56,120
Give me a gun and more hands

529
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:59,120
I wanna be your shooting man

530
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:17,220
The Orange Lounge Radio!

531
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:19,700
Back here on Orange Lounge Radio on this episode number 161.

532
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:23,600
A whole break there of Captain Jack songs from DDR because, of course, Captain Jack

533
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:27,840
passed this past week, so we're just kind of doing some tributes tonight.

534
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:31,020
Some songs there that you heard in that break, The Race, that was a song that was in not

535
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:34,900
only DDR third mix, but also a Beatmania song, kind of a fun song there.

536
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:41,020
My Generation, which I believe was the first Captain Jack song to be in American DDR, I

537
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:45,940
think, because that song was in DDR Max, right, so I think that was the first one in American

538
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:46,940
DDR.

539
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:50,740
And then In The Navy, which by the way is like my favorite steps of any Captain Jack

540
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:52,220
song, even though the song's a little cheesy.

541
00:44:52,220 --> 00:44:55,860
I do like the little trance part in the middle and the chick singing.

542
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:57,540
the song itself was kinda

543
00:44:57,540 --> 00:45:00,560
uh... well i didn't like it when the who did that some of the little those

544
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:02,880
people that's ours i don't like it when they did originally

545
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:04,200
this is going to get

546
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:06,160
uh... but i like it

547
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:09,520
i liked that i like that version because i have a little middle transport is

548
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:10,480
kinda cool

549
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:14,040
uh... and then uh... of course captain jack which is kind of the song that

550
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:17,440
everybody knows um... the actual song captain jack from third makes

551
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,680
uh... this on the heavy effort in it

552
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:21,200
i will be a fucking man

553
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,180
one point in there

554
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:27,620
That's right. He lays down the smack there. I will be your fucking man!

555
00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:31,060
And of course that song had some crazy ass steps because it was a maniac song.

556
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:33,080
And that song also appearing in the latest

557
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:35,520
DDR Home Mix Xtreme 2.

558
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:38,280
Which, by the way, speaking of DDR Xtreme 2,

559
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:42,840
our next big fat giveaway will be on next week's live program. It's going to be

560
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:44,760
something you're going to have to listen live to win.

561
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:46,300
We are giving away

562
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:49,800
a copy of Dance Dance Revolution Xtreme 2,

563
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:51,760
and here's the catch.

564
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:55,600
Not only is it a copy of DDR Extreme 2, it's a bundle, kids.

565
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:58,960
It's a bundle pack, which means it has an official Konami

566
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:01,040
soft pad bundled in with it.

567
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:03,440
And those things are not easy to get.

568
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:07,320
So if you want the best soft pad you can get, we're going

569
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:08,880
to give you a chance to win it next week.

570
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:10,920
And a copy of DDR Extreme 2 as well.

571
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:13,160
And more details to come next week.

572
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:14,320
I don't know what we're going to do.

573
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:15,960
Maybe we're going to think about that.

574
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:18,360
We're going to boo about that over this next week.

575
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:19,440
So it'll be exciting.

576
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:26,560
so we're gonna give that away. Also, one more thing I want to point out is our

577
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:29,360
message line. We are taking messages right now if you have something you want to say

578
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:34,840
about Captain Jack. Air code 9162269067. That's the brand new Orange

579
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:41,200
Lounge Radio message line. Anyway, let's talk about what else is going on in the

580
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:46,960
Milmani world this week. We have the new Midihead podcast, although I have to

581
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:50,720
be honest. I love Midyhead. He's a great guy. He's a lot of fun, and he does a great job,

582
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:55,840
but that's not a podcast, what he's doing. He is not doing a podcast. He's calling it

583
00:46:55,840 --> 00:47:00,080
a podcast, but it's not a podcast. You know why it's not a podcast? Because the MP3 was

584
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:06,800
released by itself. It was not part of a RSS feed. An RSS feed is like, I don't know if

585
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:11,160
you guys ever saw Kevin Pereira's blog. He was doing a podcast for a little while. It

586
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:15,160
wasn't a podcast. It was MP3s he was offering for download. So I'm not going to call this

587
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:20,760
thing, a podcast. It's the new Midihead MP3 where he's teasing Ultramix 3. And I'm gonna

588
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:25,000
be downright honest, I haven't had time to listen to it yet. I listened to part of it.

589
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,440
Did you? What'd you think? What's that came up?

590
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:33,040
It's just as cool as, you know, most Midihead stuff. Played some more tracks from his new

591
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:40,340
album, and it was good. And he gave, he let us know what some of the artists are gonna

592
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:44,160
be on Ultramix 3. Looks like quite a lineup, too.

593
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:46,920
Yeah, it's got a very interesting lineup in Ultramix 3.

594
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:53,240
Let's see if I can head on over here to one of the websites here, because honestly,

595
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:58,000
I've been a little bit disconnected from everything this week, so I haven't really been reading

596
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
what's going on.

597
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:03,560
I did hear, I heard some people bitching in the chat room about Good Charlotte being in

598
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:07,400
Ultramix 3, so I guess that news came out that Good Charlotte's going to be in there.

599
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:08,400
Good.

600
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:09,400
Yeah, I know.

601
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:17,120
of an interesting edition, to say the least. Of course, they might be giants. I think some

602
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:22,000
folks in the thread there used screen captures from a screenshot that was released on the

603
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,160
internet to figure out that the they might be giants song we were supposed to be getting

604
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:29,520
is Istanbul, not Constantinople, which actually makes me sad because I wanted the Tiny Toons

605
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:34,200
video in it, because that would have been awesome if it was the Tiny Toons music video.

606
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:39,120
Okay. Don't you remember on Tiny Toons like years ago, they, well of course Tiny Toons

607
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:43,040
was a badass show to begin with, but like they had an episode where they parodied MTV

608
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:46,480
and they did their own music videos and they were like two, they might be giant songs,

609
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:52,280
they did videos too and Istanbul was one of them and then Particle Man was the other one.

610
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:56,520
Particle Man, Particle Man, doing the, you know what, forget it. Screw you guys.

611
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:57,520
Right.

612
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:58,520
Screw you guys.

613
00:48:58,520 --> 00:48:59,520
No, no, keep going.

614
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:00,920
Screw you guys.

615
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:12,480
mentioned in the podcast, Moby, Black Eyed Peas, I wonder if it'll be the, what's the,

616
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:19,580
My Humps or whatever that song is, probably not, My Humps, B-52s, that's pretty awesome,

617
00:49:19,580 --> 00:49:24,080
the B-52s are awesome. I don't know which song it's going to be, but I hope they do

618
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:29,440
Rome. I liked Rome, but I'm kind of hoping for Rock Lobster a little bit, or Rock Lobster,

619
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:32,600
we're going to look at the route club and i'll probably do it

620
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:34,280
it'll probably be love shack

621
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:35,720
yeah but you know

622
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:39,280
uh... what else is there was a gap basement jacks that's pretty cool

623
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:42,960
isn't jack's uh... nowhere facts

624
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:45,600

625
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:46,960

626
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:49,960

630
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:02,340
uh...

631
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:06,400
so we got a weird weird lineup middle to make story i mean you want to see a

632
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:07,400

633
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:08,460

638
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:22,800
in the whole history

639
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:26,800
it's like my space in the form of

640
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:28,100
it totally is

641
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:33,300
it totally is all to explain is the uh... myspace mix

642
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:35,880
that's great

643
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:39,580

644
00:50:39,580 --> 00:50:42,220
i wonder what they're what's with the fun next year when they do all three

00:50:42,220 --> 00:50:45,180
four thirty to go up to the three sixty or if they're gonna stay on the regular

646
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:47,140
xbox platform what's gonna happen

647
00:50:47,140 --> 00:50:48,680
should be interesting

648
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:51,980
Of course we already know a bunch of other songs that are going to be in UltraMix 3 this year.

649
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:55,680
We have songs such as

650
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:58,680
Spray doing I Am Gothic.

651
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:03,180
So that's another, so you got like, so that's kind of another like borderline emo song.

652
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:06,180
They should have done the Kill With My Car song.

653
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:07,680
Raise Your Hands by Midihead of course.

654
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:09,680
Conflict by The Yozoic.

655
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:12,680
Basil by Orif Is.

00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:14,680
Drivin' Naoki featuring Polteri.

657
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:17,680
And Brilliant R.E.D. which is a brand new Naoki song.

658
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:21,040
which one of the screenshots gave away that was posted by another website.

659
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:25,240
Love This Feelin', the Zonk remix by Akiriyama Oka,

660
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:29,280
the remix by Zonk. And then of course the Jelly Hit, Jelly Head.

661
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:32,640
Jelly Kiss, Midi Head, Smack Mix with Togo Project featuring Sana.

662
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:36,360
Hash the Sun by Shatonix, which was on the V-Rare.

663
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:39,440
A Remix of Colors by Midi Head.

664
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:43,120
A Remix of Bailalaki, I Carried with the Wind by Jondi and Spesh.

665
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:46,960
Come With Me by Raindancer, which I believe is a

666
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:52,360
different drum crossover or something related I think and together and

667
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:55,860
forever by Captain Jack which I think is pretty cool so we do get a Captain Jack

668
00:51:55,860 --> 00:52:01,000
song in Ultramix 3 pretty appropriate at this point so that's what's going on

669
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:08,920
with Ultramix 3 should be an interesting mix all right I think what

670
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:13,060
we'll do now why don't we go ahead and let's let's um go over to the Orange

671
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:16,540
Launch Radio message line and let's see what we got on our messages and then

672
00:52:16,540 --> 00:52:19,980
we'll actually open up the Skype line in a little bit to take calls and when we

673
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:23,540
open up the Skype line to take live calls you can either call us over the

674
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:27,340
Skype line like you always do in the past or you can just get on the phone

675
00:52:27,340 --> 00:52:30,460
and punch in the digits. So we're gonna load up and see what messages we got on

676
00:52:30,460 --> 00:52:35,740
the Skype line. We wanted to see what people had to say about us. And of course

677
00:52:35,740 --> 00:52:39,340
this is a brand new thing kind of for us is this whole thing so this is very

678
00:52:39,340 --> 00:52:43,900
experimental, so I'm not sure if this is going to work.

679
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:45,140
So we'll find out.

680
00:52:45,140 --> 00:52:47,460
But we're cutting edge here on Orange Line Radio.

681
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:47,980
So why not?

682
00:52:47,980 --> 00:52:49,700
We're going to go check out what kind of

683
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:51,220
voicemails we got.

684
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:54,820
And play some messages, see what you guys have to say.

685
00:52:54,820 --> 00:52:56,060
So let's go ahead.

686
00:52:56,060 --> 00:52:58,120
And we're not taking live calls right now at this

687
00:52:58,120 --> 00:53:01,260
moment, we are simply taking the calls over

688
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:02,920
on the message line.

689
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:07,700
So let's listen to some voicemails that we got.

690
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:09,300
eat your webmaster

691
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:10,900
I like it

692
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:11,860
ha ha ha

693
00:53:11,860 --> 00:53:15,200
whoops I think that was a test call

694
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:18,860
let's try this one instead

695
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:20,700
Yea what's up it's Sam

696
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:21,880
I mean

697
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:24,640
I don't know this whole thing about Captain Jack is

698
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:26,100
pretty crappy

699
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:28,140
I mean I love the songs

700
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:31,860
good times on third mix playing Captain Jack on the standard

701
00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:33,700
oh those were good times but

702
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:35,800
y'know it's terrible a guy like that has to

703
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:37,540
pass away so

704
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:46,900
I don't know, it just sucks, but Captain Jack lives on in our hearts.

705
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:52,860
And did you also know Captain Jack, I was looking at pictures, he's a freaking pimp.

706
00:53:52,860 --> 00:53:58,980
Captain Jack is the master pimp, he had so many ladies, it was just awesome.

707
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:05,980
but it sucks about Captain Jack.

708
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:36,980
Just sitting here in my room, attending Maniac 64, just testing out this new golf thingy.

709
00:54:36,980 --> 00:54:40,980
Pants are out in the living room and just back in my room.

710
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:45,980
I'm supposed to be doing homework, but you know what? Screw you, homework! Screw you!

711
00:54:45,980 --> 00:54:53,980
Yeah, it really grinds my gears, like America does to Peter Griffin.

712
00:54:53,980 --> 00:54:58,980
I'm thinking about getting Doritos and stuff. Doritos are good, especially the ranch flavor.

713
00:54:58,980 --> 00:55:00,980
I'm just watching a movie that-

714
00:55:00,980 --> 00:55:01,980
Are you high?

715
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:02,980
Funny feeling.

716
00:55:02,980 --> 00:55:03,980
Is this guy high?

717
00:55:03,980 --> 00:55:04,980
No, I don't think so.

718
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:05,980
Alright.

719
00:55:05,980 --> 00:55:08,980
Yeah, I'm just like, jabbering.

720
00:55:08,980 --> 00:55:15,980
So yeah, Loki, I know what you did with my foot last night. I don't know what the heck was going on in that sick mind of yours.

721
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:23,980
And go to gamersadvanced.com because they have openings for like, reviewer people and stuff.

722
00:55:23,980 --> 00:55:31,980
Yeah, gamersadvanced.com with a D at the end of advance, okay?

723
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:35,980
Games.com? Yeah, it's.com.

724
00:55:35,980 --> 00:55:42,980
Come on to the... there, or else the scrolls of like, evil chocolate will take you away to the funny farm.

725
00:55:42,980 --> 00:55:43,980
Our life is good.

726
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:48,980
Yeah, just crazy random. Okay, so, like, bye. Hope you're quiet.

727
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:55,980
I think he was high. He was something.

728
00:55:55,980 --> 00:56:01,980
I think he was so high he forgot to mention Captain Jack in his minute. No, it's fine. I'm just teasing.

729
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:03,980
Doritos? I do agree with the Doritos.

730
00:56:03,980 --> 00:56:05,980
Doritos are the shit, though. Doritos are awesome.

731
00:56:05,980 --> 00:56:10,980
Branch Doritos are good, but you know what? Nothing beats the original. They're the cheesiest.

732
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:12,980
Well, the cheesiest is Cheetos, right?

733
00:56:12,980 --> 00:56:14,980
I think so.

734
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:16,980
They're the cheesiest to me in my book.

735
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:19,980
Our listeners are kind of sedated tonight. I don't know what's going on.

736
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:21,980
I don't know what's going on.

737
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:23,980
Did you guys like put on a fire or something?

738
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:25,980
Like shut all the windows or something?

739
00:56:28,980 --> 00:56:30,980
Let's go to another message.

740
00:56:30,980 --> 00:56:32,980
Greetings Orange Lounge Radio.

741
00:56:32,980 --> 00:56:36,980
This is L. Mullet with my thoughts on the passing of Captain Jack.

742
00:56:36,980 --> 00:56:39,980
I really like Captain Jack's music.

743
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:46,380
played it ever since uh the second remix home version when two of his songs were used as preview

744
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:53,660
tracks and i remember captain jack fondly he had some of my favorite songs and i remember him

745
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:58,940
especially fondly because captain jack grand ballet mix was the first catastrophic level

746
00:56:58,940 --> 00:57:05,900
song that i have ever passed which is really odd considering this step chart is incredibly

747
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:09,860
difficult to begin with.

748
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:16,980
And also, Dream of Dream was the first heavy song at Seven Stars that I ever triple-A'd.

749
00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:22,020
In any case, Captain Jack was very fun, not only to listen to, but to look at through

750
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:23,620
his music videos.

751
00:57:23,620 --> 00:57:27,980
If you wanted to know where all the white women were at, there they were.

752
00:57:27,980 --> 00:57:34,020
And in any case, I will remember him with the greatest of memories, as it were, for

753
00:57:34,020 --> 00:57:38,940
lack of better words than embarrassing myself on your new message line and it's

754
00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:45,540
okay everybody else's I shall be playing his songs in memorance and thank you for

755
00:57:45,540 --> 00:57:49,380
allowing me this forum to talk about Captain Jack thank you very much

756
00:57:49,380 --> 00:57:55,340
everyone and goodbye where the white women gonna hang out now now the

757
00:57:55,340 --> 00:57:59,300
Captain Jack's gone where all the white women gonna go they'll go hang out with

758
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:00,540
another gangster

759
00:58:00,540 --> 00:58:04,420
i don't know i don't know in germany

760
00:58:04,420 --> 00:58:06,840
wait what message i like that

761
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:08,460
wasn't from germany

762
00:58:08,460 --> 00:58:12,340
no i don't use from germany but he was big in germany like hasselhoff

763
00:58:12,340 --> 00:58:15,580
uh... was big in germany

764
00:58:15,580 --> 00:58:18,180
baywatch dot d

765
00:58:18,180 --> 00:58:21,260
let's go to another message here on the orange laundry or message line they were

766
00:58:21,260 --> 00:58:24,300
going to open it up for live calls very soon

767
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:25,180
Hi, Aaron's on.

768
00:58:25,180 --> 00:58:29,300
He's open to his goggles in the chat room.

769
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:32,740
Dream of Dream was one of the first songs I played in DDR.

770
00:58:32,740 --> 00:58:36,420
And I guess it was always pretty kind of a special place

771
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:37,660
in my heart.

772
00:58:45,180 --> 00:58:46,940
Oh, and then it hung up.

773
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:49,740
No, Dream of Dream is one of the awesome DDR songs.

774
00:58:49,740 --> 00:58:51,540
We've got to play that at some point tonight, because Dream

775
00:58:51,540 --> 00:58:55,500
Dream that's one of my favorite DDR songs as well didn't I play that like

776
00:58:55,500 --> 00:59:01,820
when my first came up here and on like episode 37 or something and we went to

777
00:59:01,820 --> 00:59:06,140
like Stockton and like they had like a fourth mix there or something and I

778
00:59:06,140 --> 00:59:11,660
played it there possibly Dream of Dreams debut was on fourth mix and it's got a

779
00:59:11,660 --> 00:59:14,620
really you know the riff is from Hall of the Mountain King which is you know one

780
00:59:14,620 --> 00:59:19,540
of the you know doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo like classic songs I I do seem

781
00:59:19,540 --> 00:59:24,300
to recall that we went out and played like fourth or fifth mix and probably that song

782
00:59:24,300 --> 00:59:28,780
came up because it's an easy as hell seven-footer, but when I say easy, I mean fun. Like it was

783
00:59:28,780 --> 00:59:33,220
like a very constant, you know, you can know the steps and a lot of people have fun with

784
00:59:33,220 --> 00:59:37,260
it. If you're going to AAA heavy songs, Dream of Dreams is a good one to start off with.

785
00:59:37,260 --> 00:59:41,540
What are you talking about? I still can't follow heavy arrows anyway.

786
00:59:41,540 --> 00:59:46,300
Well, you know, it's a good song to warm up to. It's a good song to warm up to. All right,

787
00:59:46,300 --> 00:59:50,300
We got one more message on the message line. Let's go to it.

788
00:59:50,300 --> 00:59:54,300
This is Illusion.

789
00:59:54,300 --> 00:59:58,300
When I found out Captain Jack died, I was surprised, but

790
00:59:58,300 --> 01:00:02,300
I didn't think it would affect CDR much, because

791
01:00:02,300 --> 01:00:06,300
I guess he got all his recordings out of the way.

792
01:00:06,300 --> 01:00:10,300
But, yeah, I was surprised, and it was a

793
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:14,300
sad thing to hear, and I hope his family is doing

794
01:00:14,300 --> 01:00:21,820
Yeah, of course, Captain Jack, his family, got to be taking this harder than anybody

795
01:00:21,820 --> 01:00:27,500
in the scene is. Obviously, our thoughts go out to Captain Jack's family and the surviving

796
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:33,060
relatives. How many times was Captain Jack married? Only once? I'm not sure. I think

797
01:00:33,060 --> 01:00:36,220
the lead singer of Captain Jack at one point, I know, I'm looking at extra for like he knows,

798
01:00:36,220 --> 01:00:39,860
I think the lead singer of Captain Jack at one point was his wife, but there were like

799
01:00:39,860 --> 01:00:43,620
four different women in Captain Jack at one point different different women I

800
01:00:43,620 --> 01:00:48,300
think the first one was his wife at some point do you think they were all his

801
01:00:48,300 --> 01:01:01,580
wives what no never mind okay he was in more women than they were oh shit all

802
01:01:01,580 --> 01:01:05,980
right on that note let's go Skype I will take your calls on anything anything you

803
01:01:05,980 --> 01:01:09,380
want to talk about within reason kids you can either call us the old-fashioned

804
01:01:09,380 --> 01:01:14,260
way by loading up the Skype line, or you can give us a call on the telephone.

805
01:01:14,260 --> 01:01:18,980
Of course, our brand new telephone number that you can give us a call on, it is area

806
01:01:18,980 --> 01:01:24,540
code 9162269067, either way you want to do it there.

807
01:01:24,540 --> 01:01:27,700
But of course, kids, ask your parents' permission before calling because it might be a toll

808
01:01:27,700 --> 01:01:28,700
charge.

809
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:33,100
Kind of interesting, the first experiment there on the Orange Lake message line, I notice

810
01:01:33,100 --> 01:01:37,100
some people's voices are very, very quiet, where some people are very, very loud.

811
01:01:37,100 --> 01:01:39,100
Anyway, uh, let's go to a call.

812
01:01:39,100 --> 01:01:41,100
Hello, Yarnorgen Launch Radio.

813
01:01:41,100 --> 01:01:43,100
Hi, it's Sephiroth1215.

814
01:01:43,100 --> 01:01:45,100
Hello, Sephiroth1215, what's on your mind?

815
01:01:45,100 --> 01:01:49,100
Uh, first of all, yeah, sadly, Captain Jack died.

816
01:01:49,100 --> 01:01:57,100
I actually had friends over when the news came up, and they really even played EDR, and even they were kinda...awing.

817
01:01:57,100 --> 01:02:00,100
Because they recognized the pimpness of Captain Jack.

818
01:02:00,100 --> 01:02:04,100
Surely, that guy had a ton of medals.

819
01:02:04,100 --> 01:02:06,100
For a reason.

820
01:02:06,100 --> 01:02:12,340
Anyway, I mean hopefully, I'm sure they would do something in UltraMix 3, but I don't even

821
01:02:12,340 --> 01:02:13,340
know.

822
01:02:13,340 --> 01:02:15,820
I don't think there's enough time for them to even put a little tribute in there.

823
01:02:15,820 --> 01:02:19,980
It would be nice for them to say something like in the manual or something, but seeing

824
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:25,220
as the game is probably already on its way to the pressing mill before this news came

825
01:02:25,220 --> 01:02:29,340
out, I wouldn't expect to see anything in UltraMix 3 regarding this.

826
01:02:29,340 --> 01:02:33,460
Maybe this time next year when the new DDR games come out, assuming we're getting more

827
01:02:33,460 --> 01:02:37,200
DDR games next year, but I don't see how we couldn't possibly be.

828
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:40,980
Maybe we'll see something in B-Mania, although I don't know about that, and the only way

829
01:02:40,980 --> 01:02:44,640
I guess maybe we'd get that is if the race showed up as one of the five key songs.

830
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:47,800
But you never know what might happen over at Konami, so we'll see.

831
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:52,960
Now we might see something in DDR Strike, the Japanese DDR, because that still isn't

832
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:56,200
going to be coming out until early 2006, as far as we know.

833
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:59,540
So they have plenty of time to do something for Captain Jack if they want over there.

834
01:02:59,540 --> 01:03:00,540
So we'll see.

835
01:03:00,540 --> 01:03:07,540
Yeah, yeah, hopefully they will, but on the same note, I mean, I got to play the demo

836
01:03:07,540 --> 01:03:14,540
of UltraMix 3, which, I mean, it, the demo actually was kind of broken, well, maybe it

837
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:20,460
was just a disk, but it froze up a lot for me, but otherwise it played just the same

838
01:03:20,460 --> 01:03:23,940
as UltraMix 2, except for the bubbles, and that's it.

839
01:03:23,940 --> 01:03:27,760
You know, from what I remember at E3, the game did play just like UltraMix 2 with maybe

840
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:31,800
some minor differences so I don't know but then again Ultramix 2 is one of the

841
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:35,440
better Bomani games they put out ever at the home so if it ain't broke don't fix

842
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:39,920
it right oh yeah yeah I'm sure it'd be fine it was just a demo test they got

843
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:49,320
yeah otherwise I saw an ad for it and I believe it even said in the in the chat

844
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:55,880
room that run DMC is going to be in there with walk this way really yeah

845
01:03:55,880 --> 01:03:59,880
Where did we hear that? Was that on the podcast or something? I might have missed it.

846
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:06,880
No, it was just in the chatroom before, and they have it advertised in an ad in a magazine.

847
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:08,880
They just have the background for it.

848
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:09,880
Wow.

849
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:15,880
It was based on, like, they saw, there's a screenshot of a movie which looks like, you know, from the video.

850
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:23,880
Interesting. Well, that would be a very interesting, I mean, obviously this is looking like one of the more diverse mixes we've gotten, so something like that wouldn't surprise me at all.

851
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:28,880
Well, Mitty had said that 80% of the music that was going to be in UltraMix 3 is going to be new to DDR.

852
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:31,880
Good! Good news.

853
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:36,880
If you want the Japanese crossovers, go play Xtreme 2, or go buy a Japanese PlayStation.

854
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:46,880
Also, the ad said that there's a new website called MusicInEveryDirection.com.

855
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:49,880
I went to it today, but it's not even up yet.

856
01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:53,240
and it also says coming soon to mobile

857
01:04:53,240 --> 01:04:57,240
what DDR? yeah that's kinda weird

858
01:04:57,240 --> 01:05:02,240
okay well it wouldn't surprise me I guess I mean they'd pump it up on mobile

859
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:03,480
overseas so

860
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:06,920
and you know what yeah Konami's been doing the mobile thing because I downloaded

861
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:09,280
Castlevania on a mobile phone which by the way sucked

862
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:12,360
but it was there and it was on a mobile phone

863
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:15,760
so it wouldn't surprise me if DDR shows up on mobile but

864
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:19,160
I don't really get the point because you can't dance but

865
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:21,580
whatever

866
01:05:21,580 --> 01:05:23,680
yeah yeah whatever i guess

867
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:25,480
right on

868
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:26,320
otherwise

869
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:29,660
the demo also has a demo of castlevania

870
01:05:29,660 --> 01:05:33,200
but i got really pissed off because that's the one demo that absolutely would not work on

871
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:34,760
there really

872
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:37,500
yeah oh i've got it i want to check out the castlevania demo though but it

873
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:40,980
doesn't work how does that how did that get by QA

874
01:05:40,980 --> 01:05:42,760
it says there's

875
01:05:42,760 --> 01:05:44,380
that it's not able to read disk

876
01:05:44,380 --> 01:05:46,180
every time i try and do it

877
01:05:46,180 --> 01:05:47,880
very interesting

878
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:50,060
The merit's coming out in two weeks anyways.

879
01:05:50,060 --> 01:05:52,960
Yeah, but we want to play a free demo.

880
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:54,600
Whatever.

881
01:05:54,600 --> 01:05:57,220
Free stuff rocks, I know.

882
01:05:57,220 --> 01:06:02,360
Speaking of free stuff, Toys R Us now has a deal going on this week.

883
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:04,520
Or you could buy two

884
01:06:04,520 --> 01:06:08,680
Xbox, PS2, or GameCube games and you get one free. Any of them.

885
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:10,940
Awesome. Buy two, get one free?

886
01:06:10,940 --> 01:06:15,480
Yeah. Oh man, I just bought two games at Toys R Us last week.

887
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:18,680
bastards, they always do that shit after I shop there, oh well.

888
01:06:18,680 --> 01:06:24,280
That's cool though, hey, I'm gonna have to go check that out. I imagine they're probably trying to clear the shelves to make way for an Xbox 360 setup.

889
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:25,540
Uh, but we'll see.

890
01:06:25,540 --> 01:06:28,040
Uh, maybe.

891
01:06:28,040 --> 01:06:34,340
Um, otherwise I, I guess that's it for me. Okay, sounds good, thanks for the call, and uh, take care, sub her up, okay?

892
01:06:34,340 --> 01:06:37,160
Okay, you too.

893
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:38,840
Let's go to another call.

894
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:42,640
Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's Radio.

895
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:46,480
Hello? Hello? Yes. Hello?

896
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:51,120
It's Nintendo Maniac 64. How you doing Nintendo Maniac 64?

897
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:55,960
By the way, I was not high. I knew that was you that had called in earlier.

898
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:59,880
You tell me, though, how we're supposed to not think you're high because, you know,

899
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:02,160
you got the Dorito craven going on and you

900
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:04,420
you kind of have that voice on your message like,

901
01:07:04,420 --> 01:07:07,440
Hey guys.

902
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:11,800
The phone, excuse me, it's not exactly the loudest thing.

903
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:13,000
I'm just messing with you.

904
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,060
I think we have like five bucks on that.

905
01:07:15,060 --> 01:07:18,960
What is that? There's some noise in the background there that sounds like Christopher's car.

906
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:20,240
Like this is...

907
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:22,320
Eeeeee!

908
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:24,120
This is the laptop's fan.

909
01:07:24,120 --> 01:07:28,700
Oh, okay. Cause the belt on Christopher's car is about to fall off or something, so every time he starts his car...

910
01:07:28,700 --> 01:07:31,400
Like if we had a microphone cord that we could run outside,

911
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:34,260
we probably wouldn't even need to get it outside, we'd just get it to the door.

912
01:07:34,260 --> 01:07:38,120
Seriously, every single time I start the car everybody thinks there's a fire going on somewhere.

913
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:40,420
I know when Christopher leaves for work in the morning,

914
01:07:40,420 --> 01:07:42,140
because like he'll turn on his car and then

915
01:07:42,140 --> 01:07:45,820
like you hear this really loud bell noise that

916
01:07:45,820 --> 01:07:49,920
I'm sure wakes up all the neighbors. I need to announce when I leave.

917
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:52,460
X the fuck has left the building.

918
01:07:52,460 --> 01:07:54,140
Excuse me.

919
01:07:54,140 --> 01:07:58,620
Alright. There is a song that actually has like, pardon the lyrics though, like

920
01:07:58,620 --> 01:08:01,420
let's wake up the neighbors or something.

921
01:08:01,420 --> 01:08:03,220
I usually play that when you're playing.

922
01:08:03,220 --> 01:08:04,460
I just

923
01:08:04,460 --> 01:08:07,780
you know between you and me we kind of live in the ghetto as it is so I don't

924
01:08:07,780 --> 01:08:13,460
want to have music wars around here because we will lose

925
01:08:13,460 --> 01:08:15,040

926
01:08:15,040 --> 01:08:16,300

uh... yeah

1011
01:12:04,540 --> 01:12:05,900
that was a total

1012
01:12:05,900 --> 01:12:07,780
surprise

1013
01:12:07,780 --> 01:12:10,260
yeah it was very sudden because he was so young obviously

1014
01:12:10,260 --> 01:12:12,180
oh yeah

1015
01:12:12,180 --> 01:12:15,460
you know my brother was a big fan of his

1016
01:12:15,460 --> 01:12:18,360
is your brother much of a DDR player?

1017
01:12:18,360 --> 01:12:20,000
yes

1018
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,920
okay

1019
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:24,580
okay very cool

1020
01:12:24,580 --> 01:12:26,000
uh...

1021
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:29,960
so yeah I was kind of a bummer because it was very sudden and you know everything

1022
01:12:29,960 --> 01:12:34,000
and he kind of died young which is really too bad yeah I know

1023
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,080
it sucks Exeter, it really sucks

1024
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:41,160
and some people are really hurting Exeter

1025
01:12:41,160 --> 01:12:42,040
anyway

1026
01:12:42,040 --> 01:12:48,560
uh... what else is in your mind d t

1027
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:52,320
any any cool games you play this week or tells about

1028
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:56,560
extreme to extreme to how's that going to be a lot of fun job

1029
01:12:56,560 --> 01:12:59,320
i don't know i had to start over right

1030
01:12:59,320 --> 01:13:01,880
prepped over the park orange

1031
01:13:01,880 --> 01:13:06,440
all she said he took over the power car like a good like we have a lot

1032
01:13:06,440 --> 01:13:07,240
Yeah.

1033
01:13:07,240 --> 01:13:11,140
Oh no, that's the worst. Like when the game was saving or something?

1034
01:13:11,140 --> 01:13:12,840
Yeah, when it was

1035
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:14,440
booting up.

1036
01:13:14,440 --> 01:13:17,600
Oh my god, I'm always afraid that that's going to happen to me,

1037
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:19,800
like when it says do not pull out the memory card,

1038
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:23,400
especially on those games that take forever to save to the memory card because the files are so

1039
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:27,000
huge, like a game like Coldsept or something.

1040
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:30,320
When the file's saving, I'm afraid that thunder's going to hit and then turn off my

1041
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:33,840
PlayStation 2. That would be God's little joke on me,

1042
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:38,840
Honestly. Hee hee hee, I erased your file. Hee hee hee, 27 hours on the game. Hee hee hee.

1043
01:13:38,840 --> 01:13:41,040
Hee hee, you're going to hell.

1044
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:45,540
Alright, any other thoughts for us, DT, before we get onto another call?

1045
01:13:45,540 --> 01:13:49,160
No, that's about it. I did unlock a

1046
01:13:49,160 --> 01:13:51,720
Section D on the Dancemaster mode.

1047
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:53,340
A which song?

1048
01:13:53,340 --> 01:13:57,040
So that's been kicking my ass.

1049
01:13:57,040 --> 01:13:58,700
Okay. So that's pretty much it.

1050
01:13:58,700 --> 01:14:02,020
Alrighty. Thank you for calling. Well, thanks for calling. Oh, yeah.

1051
01:14:02,020 --> 01:14:02,840
Alright. Yep.

1052
01:14:02,840 --> 01:14:03,840
Have a good one.

1053
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:04,840
Bye.

1054
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:05,840
Later.

1055
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:06,840
Yep.

1056
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:09,600
Our Skype line is screaming popular tonight.

1057
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:10,600
Let's go to another call.

1058
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:11,600
Hello?

1059
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:12,600
You're on Orange Launch Radio.

1060
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:13,600
Hey.

1061
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:14,600
This is Dark Knight.

1062
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:15,600
Hey, Dark Knight.

1063
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:16,600
What's up?

1064
01:14:16,600 --> 01:14:17,600
Yo, yo.

1065
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:18,600
Hey, JK.

1066
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:19,600
Hello, man.

1067
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:20,600
Hey, what's up?

1068
01:14:20,600 --> 01:14:25,600
I thought I'd just pass along this for you about what I heard about Yahoo maybe trying

1069
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:27,560
a little DDR themselves.

1070
01:14:27,560 --> 01:14:29,840
Yahoo is getting into DDR?

1071
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:30,840
Yeah.

1072
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:39,600
Yeah, apparently they put out, like, a little game from Wild Tangent and something like that, called, like, Dance-O-Matic or Dance Groove or something like that.

1073
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:47,080
Aw, fuck. Isn't Wild Tangent-Loki, wasn't Wild Tangent the one that did Tap-A-Jam, or am I confusing that with somebody else?

1074
01:14:47,080 --> 01:14:50,000
You remember that Tap-A-Jam, the one that was, like, Beatmania, but it was all, like, classical songs?

1075
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:51,080
Yeah, I think there was.

1076
01:14:51,080 --> 01:14:51,840
Was that them?

1077
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:54,280
Wild Tangent does something-I think Wild Tangent actually just, like-

1078
01:14:54,280 --> 01:14:57,400
No, Wild Tangent does the shitty AOL games.

1079
01:14:57,400 --> 01:15:04,200
I thought they were just, it was just like some sort of, um, like a script package or something like that.

1080
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:07,400
Devil work! That's what it is. Devil! Devil stuff!

1081
01:15:07,900 --> 01:15:08,400
No.

1082
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:11,900
Yeah, anyway, I took a look at this game and everything, right?

1083
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:18,400
Well, they do, like, bust a groove, but they also have, like, a little DDR mode as well mixed into it.

1084
01:15:19,900 --> 01:15:23,900
So it's... Oh, wait, I think I played... You know what? I think I played a game like this before.

1085
01:15:23,900 --> 01:15:27,900
Yeah, I think I pointed it out like a long time ago on AIM.

1086
01:15:27,900 --> 01:15:29,900
But it wasn't a Yahoo game, it was an AIM game.

1087
01:15:29,900 --> 01:15:33,900
No, yeah, it was an AIM game, but maybe they're like...

1088
01:15:33,900 --> 01:15:34,900
Licensing it out to Yahoo.

1089
01:15:34,900 --> 01:15:35,900
Yeah, exactly.

1090
01:15:35,900 --> 01:15:38,900
Maybe, okay, because that would make sense because if Wild Tangent did the AOL games...

1091
01:15:38,900 --> 01:15:39,900
Right.

1092
01:15:39,900 --> 01:15:42,900
Okay, okay, so this game is about to get a little bit bigger, it looks like.

1093
01:15:42,900 --> 01:15:43,900
Oh, brother.

1094
01:15:43,900 --> 01:15:44,900
Oh, goody, goody, goody.

1095
01:15:44,900 --> 01:15:46,900
Yay.

1096
01:15:46,900 --> 01:15:47,900
It looked weird.

1097
01:15:47,900 --> 01:15:50,900
I was like, wait, man, this is like Busted Groove.

1098
01:15:50,900 --> 01:15:52,900
Wait, man, it looks like CDR.

1099
01:15:52,900 --> 01:15:56,900
I suppose imitation is the finest form of flattery?

1100
01:15:56,900 --> 01:16:00,900
Very much. I mean, with the gallon there, the only problem is that

1101
01:16:00,900 --> 01:16:04,900
if you have a slow computer, of course the timing will be atrocious.

1102
01:16:04,900 --> 01:16:08,900
Oh, yeah. I remember, I seem to recall that, was that it was a very

1103
01:16:08,900 --> 01:16:12,900
slow game. Like, even on my computer, which is kind of, you know, it's nice,

1104
01:16:12,900 --> 01:16:16,900
it was kind of the slow running game. Not a very optimized game.

1105
01:16:16,900 --> 01:16:20,900
Yeah. But here's another weird story.

1106
01:16:20,900 --> 01:16:27,100
McDonald's might be, McDonald's will let Nintendo DS owners play their Wi-Fi servers.

1107
01:16:27,100 --> 01:16:31,940
I heard about this, the Wi-Fi at McDonald's. I mean, when I think about, here, let me think

1108
01:16:31,940 --> 01:16:40,700
about places I want to go play my DS. I don't think, oh, McD's. McDonald's was cool for

1109
01:16:40,700 --> 01:16:44,300
social gatherings when I was six years old and some kid would have their birthday party

1110
01:16:44,300 --> 01:16:47,700
there because their parents were poor and couldn't afford anything but a McDonald's

1111
01:16:47,700 --> 01:16:48,700
birthday party?

1112
01:16:48,700 --> 01:16:49,700
Exactly.

1113
01:16:49,700 --> 01:16:50,700
It's funny though.

1114
01:16:50,700 --> 01:16:57,420
It was like you get to be there and you have a Big Mac, an order of fries, and a Wi-Fi

1115
01:16:57,420 --> 01:16:58,420
connection.

1116
01:16:58,420 --> 01:17:01,500
Would you like to supersize your Wi-Fi?

1117
01:17:01,500 --> 01:17:03,380
Yes, I would.

1118
01:17:03,380 --> 01:17:05,460
Wow, that's going to be interesting.

1119
01:17:05,460 --> 01:17:08,180
So McDonald's is going to become the DS hotspot.

1120
01:17:08,180 --> 01:17:09,740
I believe I read that on Slashdot.

1121
01:17:09,740 --> 01:17:12,500
Yeah, I read that somewhere on the internet this week.

1122
01:17:12,500 --> 01:17:13,500
It's interesting.

1123
01:17:13,500 --> 01:17:16,540
I mean, it's weird how they send this all up.

1124
01:17:16,540 --> 01:17:22,540
Nintendo DS Wi-Fi opened up to everybody in the U.S. How about McDonald's now?

1125
01:17:46,540 --> 01:17:51,980
they built the cabinet for, you know, it had like a TV and a Nintendo 64 and stuff, so

1126
01:17:51,980 --> 01:17:52,980
you're right.

1127
01:17:52,980 --> 01:18:00,220
But one time, somebody said a Burger King had a DDR machine or something like that.

1128
01:18:00,220 --> 01:18:01,220
You know what?

1129
01:18:01,220 --> 01:18:02,220
Nothing surprises me.

1130
01:18:02,220 --> 01:18:03,220
Franchise owners can get away with a lot.

1131
01:18:03,220 --> 01:18:04,220
Yeah.

1132
01:18:04,220 --> 01:18:07,180
I figured McDonald's might get it first, but they did do like a little commercial with

1133
01:18:07,180 --> 01:18:08,180
it.

1134
01:18:08,180 --> 01:18:09,180
We'll see what happens.

1135
01:18:09,180 --> 01:18:10,180
It'll be interesting.

1136
01:18:10,180 --> 01:18:11,780
I'm curious to see what happens with the Nintendo Wi-Fi.

1137
01:18:11,780 --> 01:18:14,900
Because, you know, McDonald's has tried to do the social gathering thing before, but

1138
01:18:14,900 --> 01:18:18,260
more of a kid-oriented audience, but it's things like, okay, remember when they released

1139
01:18:18,260 --> 01:18:20,980
those 101 Dalmatian toys in the Happy Meals?

1140
01:18:20,980 --> 01:18:21,980
Yes.

1141
01:18:21,980 --> 01:18:22,980
Yeah.

1142
01:18:22,980 --> 01:18:24,940
And they would have like Tuesday trade night or whatever?

1143
01:18:24,940 --> 01:18:29,740
And sure, it was a bunch of little kids, but do you know who was really trading that stuff?

1144
01:18:29,740 --> 01:18:31,020
Their parents.

1145
01:18:31,020 --> 01:18:33,020
Their parents were trading those 101 Dalmatians.

1146
01:18:33,020 --> 01:18:35,060
It wasn't the kids, it was the damn parents.

1147
01:18:35,060 --> 01:18:36,060
Beanie Babies.

1148
01:18:36,060 --> 01:18:37,060
That's right.

1149
01:18:37,060 --> 01:18:38,060
Beanie Babies.

1150
01:18:38,060 --> 01:18:39,060
Beanie Babies.

1151
01:18:39,060 --> 01:18:40,060
Oh, yeah.

1152
01:18:40,060 --> 01:18:41,060
The McDonald's Beanie Babies.

1153
01:18:41,060 --> 01:18:42,060
Good God.

1154
01:18:42,060 --> 01:18:43,060
I used to work at McDonald's.

1155
01:18:43,060 --> 01:18:44,060
You used to work at McDonald's during that time, right?

1156
01:18:44,060 --> 01:18:48,760
all of them. Who would show up more at those Beanie Baby exchange nights, kids or the parents?

1157
01:18:48,760 --> 01:18:51,660
Soccer balls. Soccer balls.

1158
01:18:51,660 --> 01:18:54,660
Awesome.

1159
01:18:54,660 --> 01:18:58,820
That's all the news I got for you tonight. I should have some more in the coming weeks, but right now

1160
01:18:58,820 --> 01:19:00,100
those are like the two

1161
01:19:00,100 --> 01:19:05,460
major ones that are coming up. Hey, we appreciate you contributing positively to the show

1162
01:19:05,460 --> 01:19:06,020
unlike

1163
01:19:06,020 --> 01:19:09,020
Extover.

1164
01:19:09,020 --> 01:19:12,220
Bye, T.K.

1165
01:19:12,220 --> 01:19:16,280

1168
01:19:21,460 --> 01:19:22,860
total silence

1169
01:19:22,860 --> 01:19:25,200
so that i call we don't have lighten up on them

1170
01:19:25,200 --> 01:19:28,140

1171
01:19:28,140 --> 01:19:30,760

1172
01:19:30,760 --> 01:19:32,880
uh... hello

1173
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:35,800
that i would like

1174
01:19:35,800 --> 01:19:40,640
well that kind of sad when i discovered captain jack was dead because the

1175
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:45,640
The first time I played his song was Captain Jack 3rd Mix Grondale.

1176
01:19:45,640 --> 01:19:48,640
A lot of people's first songs?

1177
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:49,640
Huh?

1178
01:19:49,640 --> 01:19:52,640
A lot of people's first Captain Jack song, definitely.

1179
01:19:52,640 --> 01:19:55,640
Yeah, and I just really liked the song.

1180
01:19:55,640 --> 01:20:01,640
And I liked it even better when I heard the full version because I just thought it was awesome.

1181
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:05,640
And I was just wondering, could you please get Captain Jack Little Boy on there?

1182
01:20:05,640 --> 01:20:09,640
We will work in Captain Jack Little Boy on our next break, absolutely.

1183
01:20:09,640 --> 01:20:10,640
Bye.

1184
01:20:10,640 --> 01:20:11,640
Alright.

1185
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:16,520
That was a pretty quick request there.

1186
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:17,520
Play Little Boy.

1187
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:18,520
Click.

1188
01:20:18,520 --> 01:20:19,520
We're fine.

1189
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:23,000
Even if you're going to hang up and ditch, maybe I won't play it.

1190
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:24,480
He just called ditched us.

1191
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:26,160
He totally just called ditched us.

1192
01:20:26,160 --> 01:20:27,160
That's right.

1193
01:20:27,160 --> 01:20:28,160
We've been ditched.

1194
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:31,720
I know this guy things new.

1195
01:20:31,720 --> 01:20:35,320
I'm surprised we don't get crank calls more on this program.

1196
01:20:35,320 --> 01:20:36,320
Because we have...

1197
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:37,320
Don't say that.

1198
01:20:37,320 --> 01:20:38,720
People are actually going to do it now.

1199
01:20:38,720 --> 01:20:41,800
I scared them already because I told them we have ways of finding out who they are.

1200
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:45,120
Hey, if you want to listen to my show tomorrow,

1201
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:48,120
you can call Ditch Me. It's cool.

1202
01:20:48,120 --> 01:20:51,320
Alright, let's go to another call. Let's go to another call.

1203
01:20:51,320 --> 01:20:54,600
Hi, you're on Orange House Radio. Hey. Hi.

1204
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:59,480
Is it actually working this time? It is actually working, I hear you loud and clear.

1205
01:20:59,480 --> 01:21:03,240
Who is this? This is Roz. Hi Roz, what's on your mind?

1206
01:21:03,240 --> 01:21:06,800
Um, not too much.

1207
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:11,800
I just got home from a fun experience.

1208
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:16,800
Ooh, fun experience, huh? Tell us more about it.

1209
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:21,800
Yeah, I sat in church for an hour watching the bishop of the diocese say the rosary

1210
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:26,800
and sitting next to an old lady who wouldn't stop clearing her throat.

1211
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:31,800
You have a very strange definition of fun experience.

1212
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:33,800
Okay, there you go. Thank you.

1213
01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:37,800
Don't lie to us. Don't lie to us. That was not a fun experience.

1214
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:42,800
That was a, um, I think I want to crawl under the pew experience.

1215
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:47,800
Yeah, yeah. Afterwards, I ran into the house and took a shower.

1216
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:49,800
So, I'm good.

1217
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:54,800
Loki sitting in the back there, by the way, going,

1218
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:55,800
Now we're talking.

1219
01:21:55,800 --> 01:21:57,800
Pervert.

1220
01:21:57,800 --> 01:21:59,800
Oh, yeah. Fantasize.

1221
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:01,800
Alright.

1222
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:02,800
I encourage it.

1223
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:06,800
Now I wonder why I associate with these, um, guys.

1224
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:08,800
Uh, never mind.

1225
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:09,800
Oh, come on, you know you like it.

1226
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:13,800
To our credit, two of us, two of us are gay, you know.

1227
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:15,800
It's okay, I can hang out with the women.

1228
01:22:15,800 --> 01:22:16,800
It's cool.

1229
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:17,800
Alright, I like women.

1230
01:22:17,800 --> 01:22:18,800
I like women too.

1231
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:20,800
They're fun to shop with, anyway.

1232
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:22,800
And play around with.

1233
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:24,800
Play around meaning shop with.

1234
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:25,800
Yeah, yeah.

1235
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:26,800
God.

1236
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:28,800
Oh, now he changes it.

1237
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:31,800
Anyway, let's let our caller talk a little more then.

1238
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:32,800
Hello caller.

1239
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:37,680
I'm hitting the chat and like everyone seems horribly surprised that I'm a girl.

1240
01:22:37,680 --> 01:22:38,680
You know what?

1241
01:22:38,680 --> 01:22:41,960
For some reason it's like this big thing like OMG a gamer girl.

1242
01:22:41,960 --> 01:22:46,200
Although like I thought that was like years old now.

1243
01:22:46,200 --> 01:22:48,240
There's plenty of gamer girls out there now.

1244
01:22:48,240 --> 01:22:53,800
Actually when I first walked into that chat room, are you a guy?

1245
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:54,800
Uh, no.

1246
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:55,800
Wow.

1247
01:22:55,800 --> 01:22:59,000
Well, there's plenty of girls that play video games of all types now, so...

1248
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,400
And you have a super sounding voice, too.

1249
01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:06,300
I just thought I would say that. Jeez, don't look at me like that, Sky.

1250
01:23:06,300 --> 01:23:10,200
I'm just saying, I'm like, okay, if you want to pay the call, there's a compliment, not a problem.

1251
01:23:10,200 --> 01:23:18,500
It sounds like you would be a good addition to listening to my show starting tomorrow at seven o'clock PST.

1252
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:20,100
He ain't too proud to beg.

1253
01:23:20,100 --> 01:23:26,100
Yeah, I'm all up in the East Coast, so, you know.

1254
01:23:26,100 --> 01:23:28,100
So, like, 10 o'clock?

1255
01:23:28,100 --> 01:23:30,100
She's gotta go to bed by the time your show comes on.

1256
01:23:30,100 --> 01:23:32,100
What do you have going on in the morning on Tuesday?

1257
01:23:32,100 --> 01:23:36,100
You know what? Stop berating the listeners, Extover. Stop it.

1258
01:23:36,100 --> 01:23:38,100
We need to talk serious here for a minute.

1259
01:23:38,100 --> 01:23:40,100
It's after primetime programming.

1260
01:23:40,100 --> 01:23:43,100
Extover, I will take your mic away.

1261
01:23:43,100 --> 01:23:46,100
Roz, I need to know your thoughts on Captain Jack.

1262
01:23:46,100 --> 01:23:56,100
You know, I had no idea until after I got home from the church and being coughed on by that old lady.

1263
01:23:56,100 --> 01:24:03,100
I came back, I checked the site, and I was like, holy shit, because I had no idea.

1264
01:24:03,100 --> 01:24:09,100
That was pretty much my reaction when I found that too, I was like, wow, that was kinda sudden.

1265
01:24:09,100 --> 01:24:12,100
Yeah, it's Captain Jack, that can't happen.

1266
01:24:12,100 --> 01:24:13,100
I know.

1267
01:24:13,100 --> 01:24:14,100
Captain Jack can't die.

1268
01:24:14,100 --> 01:24:15,100
I know.

1269
01:24:15,100 --> 01:24:22,500
Captain Jack I know but yeah I don't know it's it's too bad I don't know what

1270
01:24:22,500 --> 01:24:27,260
else yeah it really is okay Ross well thanks for the call and we're gonna get

1271
01:24:27,260 --> 01:24:29,900

1272
01:24:29,900 --> 01:24:33,780

1273
01:24:33,780 --> 01:24:39,820
absolutely I'm glad to I'm glad to hear it all right take care Ross bye bye

1274
01:24:39,820 --> 01:24:44,820
Let's go to another call. One more, at least. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1275
01:24:44,820 --> 01:24:51,820
Hey, this is GS-191 in the chat rooms. Hello, GS-191 in the chat rooms. What's up?

1276
01:24:51,820 --> 01:24:58,820
Not much. I just heard about Captain Jack just now, so I'm very, very shocked.

1277
01:24:58,820 --> 01:25:02,820
Amazing that people actually get their news from our show. I always thought that we were

1278
01:25:02,820 --> 01:25:07,820
the redundancy of the Internet, but no, that's interesting. But yeah, I'm sorry you had to

1279
01:25:07,820 --> 01:25:13,180
had to find out through our show. But what do you think? I mean, it's kind of sudden,

1280
01:25:13,180 --> 01:25:14,180
huh?

1281
01:25:14,180 --> 01:25:19,340
Yeah, I remember back in the really, really old days of, like, the third mix, Korean version

1282
01:25:19,340 --> 01:25:20,340
2.

1283
01:25:20,340 --> 01:25:22,540
Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

1284
01:25:22,540 --> 01:25:23,540
I did not...

1285
01:25:23,540 --> 01:25:24,540
Shit.

1286
01:25:24,540 --> 01:25:28,100
Yeah, you could tell it's the first time.

1287
01:25:28,100 --> 01:25:31,860
It's all right. You know what? It's just Internet radio. No one expects anything.

1288
01:25:31,860 --> 01:25:32,860
Yeah.

1289
01:25:32,860 --> 01:25:33,860
It's all good, man.

1290
01:25:33,860 --> 01:25:37,500
Look, if we can get a show, anything happens.

1291
01:25:37,500 --> 01:25:40,960
Yeah, if Xtoper can get a show, anything goes on the internet.

1292
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:41,460
So feel safe.

1293
01:25:41,460 --> 01:25:42,180
Say anything.

1294
01:25:42,180 --> 01:25:42,780
Just relax.

1295
01:25:42,780 --> 01:25:43,780
Anything.

1296
01:25:43,780 --> 01:25:45,740
Yeah.

1297
01:25:45,740 --> 01:25:47,760
I remember playing the race on Third Mix,

1298
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:50,060
and that was my first Captain Jack song.

1299
01:25:50,060 --> 01:25:51,340
And I loved it.

1300
01:25:51,340 --> 01:25:55,900
And when I got home, I frantically

1301
01:25:55,900 --> 01:25:59,220
tried to search for the long version, found it, and put it

1302
01:25:59,220 --> 01:26:02,500
on repeat in my CD player for a long, long time.

1303
01:26:02,500 --> 01:26:05,780
That's what a lot of people do with DDR music when they first play the game, it's like they...

1304
01:26:05,780 --> 01:26:09,620
You know, it's kind of like you can see the life of a DDR noob?

1305
01:26:09,620 --> 01:26:14,380
It's like they play the game, then they find that song they like, then they burn their first DDR CD,

1306
01:26:14,380 --> 01:26:16,860
and they listen to it over and over and over again in the car,

1307
01:26:16,860 --> 01:26:18,580
and then they're playing it to all their friends, like,

1308
01:26:18,580 --> 01:26:20,980
this is this really cheesy DDR music!

1309
01:26:20,980 --> 01:26:22,140
That was me, anyway.

1310
01:26:22,140 --> 01:26:24,980
As Angel turns bright red.

1311
01:26:24,980 --> 01:26:28,540
Because that's what Angel did, too. You know it, you know it, guys.

1312
01:26:28,540 --> 01:26:30,660
because the angel is...

1313
01:26:30,660 --> 01:26:33,620
angel.

1314
01:26:33,620 --> 01:26:38,060
Have you picked up any of the U.S. mixes that have songs in them so you can keep playing them?

1315
01:26:38,060 --> 01:26:40,380
Yeah, I picked up

1316
01:26:40,380 --> 01:26:44,220
EX-2 right after my birthday

1317
01:26:44,220 --> 01:26:47,700
and I've been playing it non-stop.

1318
01:26:47,700 --> 01:26:49,320
It's a great game, it really is.

1319
01:26:49,320 --> 01:26:53,780
Yeah, it's a great day. But I'm looking forward to UltraMix 3, it's going to be a heck of a fall

1320
01:26:53,780 --> 01:26:56,780
with the Bomani releases, I'm very excited.

1321
01:26:56,780 --> 01:27:01,400
oh yeah me too not just captain jack but the whole break if the myspace i'd be

1322
01:27:01,400 --> 01:27:02,200
our mix

1323
01:27:02,200 --> 01:27:05,720
pretty if you have my space makes it can be a fun time

1324
01:27:05,720 --> 01:27:06,560
dot heat

1325
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:10,780
picture i won't burn in hell i know that there's always going to be one song on

1326
01:27:10,780 --> 01:27:14,340
the next is kinda like uh... it'll to make sure there was like a garage uh...

1327
01:27:14,340 --> 01:27:16,140
i mean seriously who the fuck with us on

1328
01:27:16,140 --> 01:27:19,280
so i want to go to heaven because i mean i'm already going to hell i don't want

1329
01:27:19,280 --> 01:27:21,180
to be

1330
01:27:21,180 --> 01:27:23,180
a good point

1331
01:27:23,180 --> 01:27:27,580
On that note, is there anything else you want to share with our visitors, GS-191?

1332
01:27:27,580 --> 01:27:31,620
Uh, no, not really. It's been great.

1333
01:27:31,620 --> 01:27:33,660
Well, thanks for the call.

1334
01:27:33,660 --> 01:27:37,860
Well, thank you. Alright, and thanks for listening, and uh... call back. Don't be a stranger.

1335
01:27:37,860 --> 01:27:41,000
Alright, sure. Take care. Bye. Later.

1336
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:44,360
One more call? We're just lighting up a call tonight. This is crazy.

1337
01:27:44,360 --> 01:27:48,420
Getting this new phone number was probably the best thing we ever did. Hi, you're on Orson's Radio.

1338
01:27:48,420 --> 01:27:53,160
Hey, it's me, the legend, Zaku. Hey, Zaku, what's up?

1339
01:27:53,160 --> 01:27:59,160
Yeah, I finally got through the phone after trying to hammer Skype through my PC.

1340
01:27:59,160 --> 01:28:04,160
Zaku, we've been hammered all night long. It's crazy. What's up?

1341
01:28:04,160 --> 01:28:08,160
Yeah, obviously you want my reaction to Captain Jack's death.

1342
01:28:08,160 --> 01:28:09,160
Sure.

1343
01:28:09,160 --> 01:28:20,160
It's a shame. I was pretty much shocked as soon as I came home that night and just found out through DDRFreak.

1344
01:28:20,160 --> 01:28:27,160
I mean, this pretty much hit us quickly, you know.

1345
01:28:27,160 --> 01:28:31,160
All these events happen within a matter of a week.

1346
01:28:31,160 --> 01:28:40,160
Monday, he collapses, and then a few days later, he loses his battle to survive.

1347
01:28:40,160 --> 01:28:44,160
Well, unfortunately, Zaku, it was a second stroke, unfortunately.

1348
01:28:44,160 --> 01:28:48,160
Not that that obviously makes it any better, but strokes are sudden things.

1349
01:28:48,160 --> 01:28:52,400
They're not something you have a chance to prepare for, like certain types of cancer

1350
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:57,600
and things like that, you know, so it's really unfortunate how it went down.

1351
01:28:57,600 --> 01:28:58,600
I agree.

1352
01:28:58,600 --> 01:29:04,720
I'm putting up a link right now in the chatroom that I managed to find from a threading Bobani

1353
01:29:04,720 --> 01:29:07,040
style about the U.S. version of Beatmania.

1354
01:29:07,040 --> 01:29:09,680
It involves DV games again.

1355
01:29:09,680 --> 01:29:15,120
They managed to get the date right, but the pricing you might want to take a look at.

1356
01:29:15,120 --> 01:29:19,560
Okay, so Zaku posts a link in our chatroom which is available at OrangeLawnRadio.com

1357
01:29:19,560 --> 01:29:25,560
Click on chat and he wants me to take a look at this and check out what's going on on EBGames.com

1358
01:29:25,560 --> 01:29:31,760
Wow! Okay, so they're going to ship BeatMania for the PS2 and it's saying March 1st, 2006

1359
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:35,120
$49.99 is the price. Oh, that's interesting though because...

1360
01:29:35,120 --> 01:29:36,120
Well, that's double.

1361
01:29:36,120 --> 01:29:41,120
Wait a minute. $49.99 for the game and $49.99 for the bundle?

1362
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:49,120
Yes, I was saying the same shit too. How could Konami, you know, I thought they were going to charge like 60 or 70 for that game.

1363
01:29:49,120 --> 01:29:57,120
Where they're pretty much gonna, they're pretty much shooting themselves in the foot when they're letting folks get away with a 50 dollar game.

1364
01:30:19,120 --> 01:30:26,720
for January and February. We have about 24 of them. Okay, March, we have two. So, I'm

1365
01:30:26,720 --> 01:30:30,000
going to tell you this much. They don't have any info when it's coming out yet because

1366
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:33,400
we haven't even gotten any info when that's just coming out, let alone other stuff. There's

1367
01:30:33,400 --> 01:30:36,840
stuff getting announced left and right we have no dates for, so it doesn't matter.

1368
01:30:36,840 --> 01:30:40,200
It is an interesting discovery, but I don't think it holds any weight.

1369
01:30:40,200 --> 01:30:43,320
It's just like a date for Halo 3. I mean, no one knows when that's coming out. They

1370
01:30:43,320 --> 01:30:45,200
just put it on there saying, take pre-orders.

1371
01:30:45,200 --> 01:30:46,200
Exactly.

1372
01:30:46,200 --> 01:31:03,200
Besides that, basically by the time I called you last night, Digital Life was over, but I didn't manage to get the results of the last few tournaments.

1373
01:31:03,200 --> 01:31:06,200
What happened with the rest of Digital Life?

1374
01:31:06,200 --> 01:31:13,200
One of the, this cat I know who played DVR managed to win like, he managed to win two

1375
01:31:13,200 --> 01:31:14,200
grand.

1376
01:31:14,200 --> 01:31:17,680
One of the players from within, from within New York City.

1377
01:31:17,680 --> 01:31:18,680
Very cool, congratulations.

1378
01:31:18,680 --> 01:31:25,280
If you had a free New York thread, you would know, you know.

1379
01:31:25,280 --> 01:31:28,760
But so far, I mean, it was a sort of, you know, Sunday was probably the worst day you

1380
01:31:28,760 --> 01:31:32,760
went, and I know people learn their lessons well.

1381
01:31:32,760 --> 01:31:36,280
The only good days are the ones that they hold freestyle in.

1382
01:31:36,280 --> 01:31:38,720
Keep that in mind, folks.

1383
01:31:38,720 --> 01:31:42,120
Well, if I go to Additional Life next year, I'll keep that in mind, that Sunday is not

1384
01:31:42,120 --> 01:31:43,120
the day for me to be there.

1385
01:31:43,120 --> 01:31:45,080
I'll take my flight home on Sunday next year.

1386
01:31:45,080 --> 01:31:48,320
Next year is going to be four days.

1387
01:31:48,320 --> 01:31:52,960
I'm assuming that the first day is going to be a free-play event, and then the next three

1388
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:55,080
days is going to be the tournament.

1389
01:31:55,080 --> 01:31:57,480
If I go to Additional Life next year, though, it ain't going to be just for the tournament.

1390
01:31:57,480 --> 01:31:58,480
I want to take it all in.

1391
01:31:58,480 --> 01:32:01,440
So, of course I'll go to the tournament, but you know.

1392
01:32:01,440 --> 01:32:02,440
Yeah.

1393
01:32:02,440 --> 01:32:07,440
Now you know, now you know that it's in the middle of October next year.

1394
01:32:07,440 --> 01:32:09,440
And knowing is half the battle.

1395
01:32:09,440 --> 01:32:11,440
Yeah, it's GBI Joe.

1396
01:32:11,440 --> 01:32:13,440
Alright, anything else you want to share with our listeners, Zaku?

1397
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:16,440
I gotta get some more calls because we've got people hammering us.

1398
01:32:16,440 --> 01:32:18,440
Yeah, that's about it, man.

1399
01:32:18,440 --> 01:32:20,440
I already showed you.

1400
01:32:20,440 --> 01:32:22,440
Well, have a good one. Thanks for the call, Zaku.

1401
01:32:22,440 --> 01:32:23,440
Goodbye.

1402
01:32:23,440 --> 01:32:24,440
Alright.

1403
01:32:24,440 --> 01:32:26,440
Later.

1404
01:32:26,440 --> 01:32:28,440
We gotta get some more calls.

1405
01:32:28,440 --> 01:32:30,440
Hi, you're on Orange House Radio.

1406
01:32:30,440 --> 01:32:32,120
Hey, what's up? It's DJ Rama S.

1407
01:32:32,120 --> 01:32:34,520
Hello, DJ Rama S. What's on your mind?

1408
01:32:34,520 --> 01:32:37,080
Not much. I just wanted to say a couple things about the captain.

1409
01:32:37,080 --> 01:32:40,160
You cosplayed the captain, didn't you?

1410
01:32:40,160 --> 01:32:41,720
No, but I'm planning on it.

1411
01:32:41,720 --> 01:32:44,420
Oh, I thought you said you would cosplay him at one point.

1412
01:32:44,420 --> 01:32:47,820
No, I said I plan to. Hopefully, maybe Captain Con next year.

1413
01:32:47,820 --> 01:32:49,680
My bad, my bad.

1414
01:32:49,680 --> 01:32:53,880
Well, prepare to be surrounded by white women, because that's what happens with Captain Jack.

1415
01:32:53,880 --> 01:32:55,080
So...

1416
01:32:55,080 --> 01:32:57,360
Hey, I love it.

1417
01:32:57,360 --> 01:32:59,520
Which is why he told me on...

1418
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:03,280
nevermind i'm not exactly why am i

1419
01:33:03,280 --> 01:33:07,400
mother not close up anyway doesn't matter we obviously we're just getting

1420
01:33:07,400 --> 01:33:11,680
you know joking around with a tough like that obviously you know it's all about

1421
01:33:11,680 --> 01:33:15,000
peaches people hot bitches of all types

1422
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:19,760
self actually we have every when he told me i thought it you know i was like

1423
01:33:19,760 --> 01:33:21,600
somebody was playing a joke i was just like

1424
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:25,920
are you sure he's a pretty sure and i'm like are you sure where the captain jack

1425
01:33:25,920 --> 01:33:26,920
Yeah.

1426
01:33:26,920 --> 01:33:27,920
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1427
01:33:27,920 --> 01:33:30,320
When he was actually in the hospital and stuff, we didn't know.

1428
01:33:30,320 --> 01:33:31,320
Oh, yeah.

1429
01:33:31,320 --> 01:33:33,800
Well, yeah, because the only site that was really reporting on it was like an obscure...

1430
01:33:33,800 --> 01:33:37,720
Well, it was MSM, but it was in Germany because it was the only country where Captain Jack

1431
01:33:37,720 --> 01:33:42,160
was really charting on the charts, so no other news services picked it up.

1432
01:33:42,160 --> 01:33:43,160
Right.

1433
01:33:43,160 --> 01:33:44,160
Anyway.

1434
01:33:44,160 --> 01:33:45,160
Thank you for telling me.

1435
01:33:45,160 --> 01:33:46,160
Yeah.

1436
01:33:46,160 --> 01:33:47,160
I appreciate that.

1437
01:33:47,160 --> 01:33:48,160
Hey, no problem.

1438
01:33:48,160 --> 01:33:50,040
So anything else you want to share about the whole Captain Jack thing?

1439
01:33:50,040 --> 01:33:52,840
Yeah, a couple of things.

1440
01:33:52,840 --> 01:33:58,280
One thing Captain Jack, it means a lot to me because at an amazement I did a walk on

1441
01:33:58,280 --> 01:34:03,880
his naval Barrett to End the Navy, which is one of my personal favorite songs.

1442
01:34:03,880 --> 01:34:09,880
So it kind of tore my heart a bit to hear that news, so yeah.

1443
01:34:09,880 --> 01:34:10,880
I know.

1444
01:34:10,880 --> 01:34:14,560
It's like one of those things where you don't want to say, oh my gosh, I'm getting depressed

1445
01:34:14,560 --> 01:34:16,760
over a DDR artist passing away.

1446
01:34:16,760 --> 01:34:21,300
But at the same time, it's like, you know, the circumstance and the fact that he was

1447
01:34:21,300 --> 01:34:27,380
just a fun party guy and died at a young age, just kind of makes you go, life sucks. Life

1448
01:34:27,380 --> 01:34:28,380
sucks.

1449
01:34:28,380 --> 01:34:35,160
I was just going to say, everybody that calls in, they have a memory of some song that they've

1450
01:34:35,160 --> 01:34:40,340
heard before, that obviously this guy was a strong presence for you all when you guys

1451
01:34:40,340 --> 01:34:43,180
started getting into DDR, so that is sad.

1452
01:34:43,180 --> 01:34:47,100
Wow, you said something profound on this show.

1453
01:34:47,100 --> 01:34:48,100
I did. I can be profound.

1454
01:34:48,100 --> 01:34:53,060
fuck somebody knows the date and time no you you're absolutely right I think a

1455
01:34:53,060 --> 01:34:58,020
lot of time presses because because Captain Jack is so he's got such a

1456
01:34:58,020 --> 01:35:02,300
strong personality and the songs are very unique like him or not you know a

1457
01:35:02,300 --> 01:35:04,620
Captain Jack song when you hear it because it sounds like somebody's

1458
01:35:04,620 --> 01:35:08,540
parking orders at you and people remember that with DDR and people have

1459
01:35:08,540 --> 01:35:11,860
such fond memories about DDR and playing DDR with their friends kind of like how

1460
01:35:11,860 --> 01:35:14,700
they were saying in the opening of the the show when you know only you

1461
01:35:14,700 --> 01:35:23,700
Everybody would get down and, you know, throw all your hands up, hands up, and everybody would do it, and like, everybody did the same stupid little dance to that, you know, and it's...

1462
01:35:23,700 --> 01:35:29,700
You associate all that, I guess, with Captain Jack, the fact that, you know, those bonding times that you had playing DDR, so...

1463
01:35:29,700 --> 01:35:35,700
Xtavor, you're right.

1464
01:35:35,700 --> 01:35:36,700
Thank you.

1465
01:35:36,700 --> 01:35:37,700
You're welcome.

1466
01:35:37,700 --> 01:35:38,700
Sorry, Ronma, I didn't mean to...

1467
01:35:38,700 --> 01:35:39,700
It's okay.

1468
01:35:39,700 --> 01:35:41,700
Anything else you want to share?

1469
01:35:41,700 --> 01:35:53,700
Yeah, two things before I go. Another reason why Captain Jack needs something to me, I'm going to post this link. Someone YTMND, as Taylor Barrett, and if you click on you here in the Navy.

1470
01:35:53,700 --> 01:35:56,700
I'm afraid to bring that up because YTMND-

1471
01:35:56,700 --> 01:35:58,700
It's a good one. I know a good one, seriously.

1472
01:35:58,700 --> 01:36:03,700
But my computer doesn't like YTMND, so I don't know if I can pull it up, but go, chat room, go for it.

1473
01:36:03,700 --> 01:36:10,700
And right here, standing in front of my computer, I have a can of Budweiser. Crack it one open for the captain.

1474
01:36:10,700 --> 01:36:13,700
Poor a 40 for me!

1475
01:36:13,700 --> 01:36:18,700
Damn, I'm not that ghetto, son!

1476
01:36:18,700 --> 01:36:21,700
I am!

1477
01:36:21,700 --> 01:36:25,700
Oh, if it's like that, you could have a good ol' time at CatDoo!

1478
01:36:25,700 --> 01:36:29,700
Hell yeah, hell yeah. Maybe I should cosplay as the captain.

1479
01:36:29,700 --> 01:36:32,700
Um...no.

1480
01:36:32,700 --> 01:36:36,700
I know some single gay guys.

1481
01:36:36,700 --> 01:36:43,700
Me too. Yeah, but that don't mean nothing. Anyway, I'm gonna let you go before this conversation gets ugly.

1482
01:36:43,700 --> 01:36:47,700
Alright. Alright, have a good one. Peace out. Later. Peace.

1483
01:36:47,700 --> 01:36:53,700
And me surrounded by, uh, hot people. No, I'm just kidding. Anyway, let's get to it.

1484
01:36:53,700 --> 01:36:57,700
One more call. I keep saying that, but I keep saying all these, I keep seeing all these names that have been hammering us.

1485
01:36:57,700 --> 01:37:05,700
We need to shut them off. What? No, I've been, I've been seeing all these names, like, hammering us all night long, and I, I know that people want to say stuff about the captain, so I feel an obligation to get to all these calls.

1486
01:37:05,700 --> 01:37:07,700
So this is the last one for now.

1487
01:37:07,700 --> 01:37:10,700
Hi, you're on Arizona Radio.

1488
01:37:10,700 --> 01:37:12,700
Oh wow, I'm the last one. I feel privileged.

1489
01:37:12,700 --> 01:37:13,700
Our test is J100M.

1490
01:37:13,700 --> 01:37:16,700
Well, I see you've been hammering us for like 30 minutes, so I feel bad for you.

1491
01:37:16,700 --> 01:37:18,700
So I want to know what you threw. What's up?

1492
01:37:18,700 --> 01:37:20,700
Yeah, I'm pretty pathetic.

1493
01:37:20,700 --> 01:37:23,700
It's all good. We appreciate it.

1494
01:37:23,700 --> 01:37:26,700
No, nothing. I just found out the bad news about Captain Jack

1495
01:37:26,700 --> 01:37:29,700
after coming back from seeing Doom.

1496
01:37:29,700 --> 01:37:31,700
So that's two bad things in a row.

1497
01:37:31,700 --> 01:37:38,700
Oh shit, you know things come in threes too, so brace yourself. Well, you're listening to this program, I suppose.

1498
01:37:38,700 --> 01:37:40,700
And warts, who knows?

1499
01:37:45,700 --> 01:37:52,700
Don't have sex in the next 24 hours, because you're bound to catch something. Bad things come in threes, so be careful.

1500
01:37:52,700 --> 01:37:59,700
Well yeah, well I'm about to go play the new Budokai Tenkaichi with my roommate after this.

1501
01:37:59,700 --> 01:38:01,540
gonna blow up your console

1502
01:38:01,540 --> 01:38:06,380
or i'll get raped but

1503
01:38:06,380 --> 01:38:10,660
either way what are your thoughts on captain jack

1504
01:38:10,660 --> 01:38:11,520
uh...

1505
01:38:11,520 --> 01:38:16,420
uh... i'm just disappointed i'm not gonna hear uh... any new songs

1506
01:38:16,420 --> 01:38:20,300
from any any more on any of the new DDRs but

1507
01:38:20,300 --> 01:38:21,260
i don't know

1508
01:38:21,260 --> 01:38:24,500
maybe he's like Tupac and he has like a bunch of songs that haven't been released

1509
01:38:24,500 --> 01:38:26,260
yeah you never know

1510
01:38:26,260 --> 01:38:30,860
maybe still alive somewhere. Maybe the whole damn thing is a conspiracy.

1511
01:38:30,860 --> 01:38:32,660
They'll find him in Mexico.

1512
01:38:32,660 --> 01:38:34,180
Yeah, Mexico,

1513
01:38:34,180 --> 01:38:39,080
Canada. I can see the hate mail coming in right now towards Longoria.

1514
01:38:39,080 --> 01:38:41,580
Anything else on your mind?

1515
01:38:41,580 --> 01:38:43,980
Nope, other than

1516
01:38:43,980 --> 01:38:45,780
Doom was a disappointment.

1517
01:38:45,780 --> 01:38:50,700
Was that first person stuff as stupid as it looked in the preview?

1518
01:38:50,700 --> 01:38:55,520
Well, to tell you the truth, they only really had it for about

1519
01:38:55,520 --> 01:38:59,080
two to five minutes of the uh... the last part of the movie. Really?

1520
01:38:59,080 --> 01:39:06,080
That still seems like a long time. Five minutes is a goddamn long time. I thought it was gonna be, well seriously though, the way that they hyped it up, it was supposed to be like the big thing in the movie.

1521
01:39:06,080 --> 01:39:09,560
Well thank god because that shit looked cheesy.

1522
01:39:09,560 --> 01:39:12,680
It did, but you know... Yeah, it was cheesy.

1523
01:39:12,680 --> 01:39:17,400
And they did not have, somebody in chat, I don't know if it was you or somebody else, I just saw it fly by in the chatroom earlier,

1524
01:39:17,400 --> 01:39:20,220
said that the flying eyeballs are not in the movie.

1525
01:39:20,220 --> 01:39:23,140
Yeah, yeah I said that. That's bullshit.

1526
01:39:23,140 --> 01:39:26,100
I was expecting flaming skulls and

1527
01:39:26,100 --> 01:39:29,460
skeletons with rocket launches on their shoulders.

1528
01:39:29,460 --> 01:39:33,340
I think it was Roger Ebert that said that the best thing in the film was like the

1529
01:39:33,340 --> 01:39:35,260
beginning universal logo.

1530
01:39:35,260 --> 01:39:37,780
Like there was some big thing that they did at the beginning.

1531
01:39:37,780 --> 01:39:42,040
Like was that the best thing in the film?

1532
01:39:42,040 --> 01:39:45,700
No, you know they had a couple of

1533
01:39:45,700 --> 01:39:48,740
subtle things in the movie.

1534
01:39:48,740 --> 01:39:52,340
The best thing about Doom will probably be the trailer for Harry Potter

1535
01:40:22,340 --> 01:40:26,340
We have time. And try not to kill yourself on the way out, Extrofer.

1536
01:40:26,340 --> 01:40:30,340
Alright, anyway, um, let's go to a break. Damn, I need a break.

1537
01:40:30,340 --> 01:40:34,340
And I promised somebody we could hear Little Boy, so we're gonna play that song

1538
01:40:34,340 --> 01:40:38,340
from DDR Max 2, and when we come back

1539
01:40:38,340 --> 01:40:42,340
we will probably get into the cage match and talk about some other stuff as well.

1540
01:40:42,340 --> 01:40:46,340
So, let's go to a break. I know that

1541
01:40:46,340 --> 01:40:50,340
microphone is being awful.

1542
01:40:50,340 --> 01:40:52,840
It was, it was left on for some reason.

1543
01:40:52,840 --> 01:40:57,340
Alright, we're gonna play this, it's the, it's actually the full version of Little Boy.

1544
01:40:57,340 --> 01:40:59,860
play that in a couple other little Captain Jack songs and we'll be back

1545
01:40:59,860 --> 01:41:01,860
after this

1546
01:41:29,860 --> 01:41:47,180
Dream on, dream on, make my day You will find a better way

1547
01:41:47,180 --> 01:41:50,180
Dream on and you'll realize That one day you'll pay the price

1548
01:41:50,180 --> 01:41:53,180
Keep on going till tomorrow You will find there is no tomorrow

1549
01:41:53,180 --> 01:41:57,180
Keep on dreaming of this toy You can use my little boy

1550
01:41:57,180 --> 01:42:04,280
Dream on my list, boy, dream on my list, boy Dream on my list, boy, go out and have some joy

1551
01:42:04,400 --> 01:42:10,400
List, boy, dream on my list, boy Dream on my list, boy, go out and have some joy

1552
01:42:40,400 --> 01:42:41,820
If you do it on my way,

1553
01:42:41,840 --> 01:42:43,400
I give honors that you follow

1554
01:42:43,400 --> 01:42:44,880
Come with me until tomorrow

1555
01:42:44,880 --> 01:42:46,600
I'm your captain and your jaw

1556
01:42:46,600 --> 01:42:48,200
You can use my little boy

1557
01:42:49,100 --> 01:42:50,560
Dream of my little boy

1558
01:42:50,580 --> 01:42:52,180
Dream of my little boy

1559
01:42:52,200 --> 01:42:53,840
Dream of my little boy

1560
01:42:53,840 --> 01:42:55,680
Go out and have some joy

1561
01:42:55,900 --> 01:42:56,680
Little boy

1562
01:42:56,820 --> 01:42:58,240
Dream of my little boy

1563
01:42:58,380 --> 01:43:00,040
Dream of my little boy

1564
01:43:00,040 --> 01:43:28,040
Hey, little boy, do you think you'll miss her, right?

1565
01:43:28,040 --> 01:43:33,040
She still wants to choose a man, the only one she wants to be

1566
01:43:33,040 --> 01:43:39,040
Realize reality, you're not Mr. Right

1567
01:43:39,040 --> 01:43:43,040
Running on that subway seat alone

1568
01:43:43,040 --> 01:43:46,040
I'm waiting for a loving man to come

1569
01:43:46,040 --> 01:43:49,040
Looking for a love to stay

1570
01:43:49,040 --> 01:43:51,040
Listen what I gotta say

1571
01:43:51,040 --> 01:43:53,040
Oh

1572
01:44:21,040 --> 01:44:23,040
But I need

1573
01:45:21,040 --> 01:45:41,760
My black boy, you're black boy I'm gonna take you back on fire

1574
01:45:41,760 --> 01:45:45,200
Be like my old trappin' fiend Like your idol, I'm sayin'

1575
01:45:45,200 --> 01:45:48,080
It's my mind, you're like a machine Take a moment, be my friend

1576
01:46:48,080 --> 01:46:50,080
Aye, Aye, Aye, Aye, Aye, Aye

1577
01:46:50,080 --> 01:46:52,080
Singing this song, Captain Jack

Aye, Aye, Aye, Aye, Aye

1579
01:46:54,080 --> 01:46:56,080
All your lives are kept in the back

Aye, Aye, Aye, Aye, Aye, Aye

1581
01:46:58,080 --> 01:47:21,080
No matter what goes on, every one of us better set us in From the bottom level to the top of the top of the top

1582
01:47:21,080 --> 01:47:24,120
S kick you gotta get a shot inside

1583
01:47:24,640 --> 01:47:26,040
No matter what

1584
01:47:26,360 --> 01:47:29,480
I never told ya that it isn't work

1585
01:47:29,660 --> 01:47:31,640
I really comparing

1586
01:47:31,760 --> 01:47:35,960
A board that is something we all know

1587
01:47:36,360 --> 01:47:38,120
Dadada Lila

1588
01:47:38,160 --> 01:47:45,600
Liara Liara

1589
01:48:15,600 --> 01:48:40,960
Hi Ho, Kermit the Frog here informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio

1590
01:48:40,960 --> 01:48:44,960
It's brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.

1591
01:48:44,960 --> 01:48:49,960
Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

1592
01:48:49,960 --> 01:48:51,960
Listen, frog!

1593
01:48:51,960 --> 01:48:53,960
Hi-ya!

1594
01:48:53,960 --> 01:48:55,960
I love the Muppets.

1595
01:48:55,960 --> 01:48:59,960
Anyway, we're back on Orange Moms Radio.

1596
01:48:59,960 --> 01:49:02,960
In that break, you heard Captain Jack with Little Boy, the original.

1597
01:49:02,960 --> 01:49:07,960
And oh my gosh, the chat room freaked out because I wasn't playing the remix that's in DDR.

1598
01:49:07,960 --> 01:49:11,960
was the original, but it gives you guys a chance to hear maybe something you haven't

1599
01:49:11,960 --> 01:49:12,960
heard before.

1600
01:49:12,960 --> 01:49:13,960
Imagine that.

1601
01:49:13,960 --> 01:49:20,000
Iko Iko from Dance Mania 21 and Dancing Pompocolin from DDR Fifth Mix.

1602
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:21,000
Good times.

1603
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:25,360
And did you notice, Extafur, I'm sure you noticed the lyrics in Iko Iko, did you hear

1604
01:49:25,360 --> 01:49:26,360
Set Your Fag on Fire?

1605
01:49:26,360 --> 01:49:27,360
I did.

1606
01:49:27,360 --> 01:49:28,360
Because you pointed it out.

1607
01:49:28,360 --> 01:49:32,240
Yes, at Captain Jack's request, we will be setting Extafur on fire at the end of the

1608
01:49:32,240 --> 01:49:33,240
show.

1609
01:49:33,240 --> 01:49:34,240
How funny.

1610
01:49:34,240 --> 01:49:37,080
We're going to set our fag on fire.

1611
01:49:37,080 --> 01:49:45,240
All right, um, anyway, we're going to go over to Loki.

1612
01:49:45,240 --> 01:49:50,360
Loki's actually got some, um, Bahmani-related news going on.

1613
01:49:50,360 --> 01:49:55,400
Uh, something about, what's this, something, somebody's doing a homebrew thingy?

1614
01:49:55,400 --> 01:50:00,040
Yeah, I was looking for that, because I can't, I don't see it.

1615
01:50:00,040 --> 01:50:02,520
It was there, but it's gone.

1616
01:50:02,520 --> 01:50:09,240
Someone, of course, making games for the PSP, and the one that they had on there, which

1617
01:50:09,240 --> 01:50:17,520
I can't find for the life of me, is called Button Master Revolution. It's like DDR, but,

1618
01:50:17,520 --> 01:50:24,740
you know, not. And I can't find any info on it because the fucking links are gone, so

1619
01:50:24,740 --> 01:50:30,320
fuck them for updating their stupid website and not having, like most websites do, a news

1620
01:50:30,320 --> 01:50:35,280
archive where you can go to the next page, the next page, the next page. No! We're too

1621
01:50:35,280 --> 01:50:42,360
good for that. So fucking A, but... Yeah, it was really cool-looking. I wish I could

1622
01:50:42,360 --> 01:50:49,340
talk more about it, but I can't find the goddamn link, so... Yay! So we'll go... Holy...

1623
01:50:49,340 --> 01:50:56,100
Live radio, boys and girls. Hey, I got Bahmani-related news. Go ahead. Okay, I just remembered this,

1624
01:50:56,100 --> 01:50:59,000
because something that was just said in the chat room reminded me of this. You know they

1625
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:06,320
They showed a little preview of the new Madonna video for Hung Up, the super gay gay gay gay

1626
01:51:06,320 --> 01:51:09,620
gay gay song that's coming out very soon.

1627
01:51:09,620 --> 01:51:13,300
They showed a little preview of the video on Total Request Live and somebody put it

1628
01:51:13,300 --> 01:51:14,300
on the internet.

1629
01:51:14,300 --> 01:51:15,300
Well, get this.

1630
01:51:15,300 --> 01:51:16,300
Frickin' DDR's in the video.

1631
01:51:16,300 --> 01:51:18,300
Should I show this in the little?

1632
01:51:18,300 --> 01:51:20,740
I'll even post this link in the chat room.

1633
01:51:20,740 --> 01:51:24,460
I'm going to post a link to the little video clip that they have and I'll play it in studio

1634
01:51:24,460 --> 01:51:28,500
and see what you guys think here about this clip of Hung Up.

1635
01:51:28,500 --> 01:51:32,340
actually I guess it's not really DDR but it's actually dancing stage fusion but

1636
01:51:32,340 --> 01:51:37,900
you know DDR it's still DDR a TDR under a different name but you know Madonna

1637
01:51:37,900 --> 01:51:44,860
she's got to be so British I is she denounced her American ship yet or is

1638
01:51:44,860 --> 01:51:49,700
she I don't know American citizenship whatever you call it cuz you know she's

1639
01:51:49,700 --> 01:51:55,540
called be so British let's see here we go I'm gonna play this and then I'll

1640
01:51:55,540 --> 01:51:58,060
post this link in the chat room for you guys as well so you can check this out

1641
01:51:58,060 --> 01:52:09,460
this is a clip of Madonna's new and it's got a video and I can't play it in

1642
01:52:09,460 --> 01:52:15,720
Firefox I have to open up Internet Explorer because um Firefox won't play

1643
01:52:15,720 --> 01:52:21,040
that clip but I want to play it for you guys in studio and here we go again

1644
01:52:21,040 --> 01:52:25,000
that's posted in our chat room at orange launch radio comm click on chat and here

1645
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:28,820
So here it is for us in the studio.

1646
01:52:28,820 --> 01:52:51,920
Yeah, so you can see, what was Madonna doing at the end of the clip there?

1647
01:52:51,920 --> 01:52:55,280
She's like doing that rolling in the dough thing on the DDR machine.

1648
01:52:55,280 --> 01:52:59,560
She's really getting down on that machine, and she's kind of surrounded by her dancers,

1649
01:52:59,560 --> 01:53:04,120
so DDR is making it into the mainstream, that's for sure.

1650
01:53:04,120 --> 01:53:05,120
Madonna bugs me.

1651
01:53:05,120 --> 01:53:06,120
What?

1652
01:53:06,120 --> 01:53:07,120
And you're gay!

1653
01:53:07,120 --> 01:53:08,120
I know, I can't stand...

1654
01:53:08,120 --> 01:53:14,080
I've never really liked her, except for with the exception of her Oh Father video, but

1655
01:53:14,080 --> 01:53:17,840
I don't know, just something about her, she's just pretentious.

1656
01:53:17,840 --> 01:53:21,440
So has DDR officially jumped the shark with this or something?

1657
01:53:21,440 --> 01:53:26,440
I don't know. I mean, I can't stand the song. I think the song absolutely sucks.

1658
01:53:26,440 --> 01:53:30,440
That's what you said when I played it the other day.

1659
01:53:30,440 --> 01:53:32,440
I did not say that I liked that song.

1660
01:53:32,440 --> 01:53:35,440
You didn't say you liked it, but you said it wasn't that bad.

1661
01:53:35,440 --> 01:53:38,440
I didn't say anything about it, I don't think.

1662
01:53:38,440 --> 01:53:41,440
I don't even like the ABBA original.

1663
01:53:41,440 --> 01:53:43,440
Everybody hating me now because I just said that.

1664
01:53:43,440 --> 01:53:46,440
No, I don't. It's fine.

1665
01:53:46,440 --> 01:53:50,440
But DDR in the video? Good thing or bad thing for DDR?

1666
01:53:50,440 --> 01:53:55,640
I mean, that's cool and everything. Madonna, obviously, is huge.

1667
01:53:55,640 --> 01:54:03,120
By her having the video game in her video, that's a big deal.

1668
01:54:03,120 --> 01:54:07,760
Just me, a personal thing, I don't like her.

1669
01:54:07,760 --> 01:54:16,960
What do you think, Loki, as a straight guy, who, as this Madonna doing an Abba thing must

1670
01:54:16,960 --> 01:54:22,360
be very very very gay and now to see DDR in the video makes it gay gay what do

1671
01:54:22,360 --> 01:54:27,380
you think I think she's just trying to you know throw as much pop culture

1672
01:54:27,380 --> 01:54:34,280
references in there you know to she's insane just like you know freaking Tom

1673
01:54:34,280 --> 01:54:39,360
Cruise okay they're all lumped together freaking crazy ass people you know what

1674
01:54:39,360 --> 01:54:46,320
the last thing I'd be doing once I got lots of money would be going insane it's

1675
01:54:46,320 --> 01:54:50,320
I have lots of money to buy stuff. No, I think I'll go insane instead.

1676
01:54:50,320 --> 01:54:54,320
Let's just denounce everything. Let's be as whacked out crazy as possible.

1677
01:54:54,320 --> 01:54:58,320
Let's become Jewish, and then Catholic, and then Jewish, and then Catholic, and then Jewish, and then Catholic.

1678
01:54:58,320 --> 01:55:02,320
And then Kambala. And Scientologist.

1679
01:55:02,320 --> 01:55:06,320
Yeah, so, you know, Esther can go fuck my ass.

1680
01:55:06,320 --> 01:55:10,320
Stupid Esther. I like Madonna.

1681
01:55:10,320 --> 01:55:14,320
I don't like Ugo over Madonna, but you know, she's cool. I respect what she's doing.

1682
01:55:14,320 --> 01:55:18,920
Esther I mean you've got to respect Madonna's freestyle though in the video

1683
01:55:18,920 --> 01:55:22,200
because she's looking away from the screen so I give her points for that

1684
01:55:22,200 --> 01:55:26,120
somebody in the chair who says OMG Madonna is triple-aing paranoia survivor

1685
01:55:26,120 --> 01:55:31,960
max only s4r you guys are nerds and making a music video at the same time

1686
01:55:31,960 --> 01:55:42,880
angel DDR in a Madonna video good good for DDR or bad news I don't know I guess

1687
01:55:42,880 --> 01:55:46,880
I guess it's okay, but it's Madonna, right?

1688
01:55:46,880 --> 01:55:50,880
No.

1689
01:55:50,880 --> 01:55:54,880
Nobody heard that.

1690
01:55:54,880 --> 01:55:58,880
You gotta talk in the microphone if you wanna talk around here.

1691
01:55:58,880 --> 01:56:02,880
If she's gonna do a DDR video, she should've done a live version of her

1692
01:56:02,880 --> 01:56:06,880
Like A Virgin where she like, humped the stage. You know, the dancing stage.

1693
01:56:06,880 --> 01:56:10,880
Okay. And on that note, Skye.

1694
01:56:10,880 --> 01:56:14,880
Loki, do you have anything else going on in the DDR world you want to share?

1695
01:56:14,880 --> 01:56:18,880
Didn't the new website open up or something, speaking of gay?

1696
01:56:18,880 --> 01:56:22,880
Yeah, the Ultramix 3 website

1697
01:56:22,880 --> 01:56:26,880
was launched and they changed the freaking logo on us

1698
01:56:26,880 --> 01:56:30,880
to something that's super duper gay-tastic

1699
01:56:30,880 --> 01:56:34,880
So what's the logo look like now? Well, let me just pull it up for you

1700
01:56:34,880 --> 01:56:38,880
since that's what I do nowadays

1701
01:56:38,880 --> 01:56:45,680
And actually what I'll do is it's really bad it basically it's kind of this party

1702
01:56:45,680 --> 01:56:54,240
theme with a giant friggin rainbow going through it so yeah basically here it is

1703
01:56:54,240 --> 01:57:00,960
right here okay be afraid it's giant rainbow as it's

1704
01:57:00,960 --> 01:57:05,560
revolution rainbow tastic hey Emmys got her outfit from the graduation video I

1705
01:57:05,560 --> 01:57:08,560
I don't make a lot of fanboys happy because that skirt is very short.

1706
01:57:08,560 --> 01:57:10,560
Slut Emmy would have been better.

1707
01:57:10,560 --> 01:57:11,560
But anyways.

1708
01:57:11,560 --> 01:57:12,560
There it is.

1709
01:57:12,560 --> 01:57:17,560
UltraMix 3 with its stupid Rainbowtastic stuff.

1710
01:57:17,560 --> 01:57:19,560
Yeah.

1711
01:57:19,560 --> 01:57:22,560
Interesting.

1712
01:57:22,560 --> 01:57:23,560
So that was really lame.

1713
01:57:23,560 --> 01:57:25,560
But they did have, um...

1714
01:57:25,560 --> 01:57:28,560
There's some screenshots on there which, you know, sort of, you know...

1715
01:57:28,560 --> 01:57:30,560
That's where we got all the, um...

1716
01:57:30,560 --> 01:57:33,560
You know, new songs that were coming out and stuff.

1717
01:57:33,560 --> 01:57:40,680
Because they had a background for, you know, Brilliant Red and all that stuff, so.

1718
01:57:40,680 --> 01:57:45,160
But you can always check back for the Song of the Week, they've got new stuff.

1719
01:57:45,160 --> 01:57:51,640
They had Moment 40 on there from the VRare for the Song of the Week, and then of course

1720
01:57:51,640 --> 01:57:54,200
next week will be something better, so.

1721
01:57:54,200 --> 01:57:57,720
Hung up by Madonna to match the theme, you think?

1722
01:57:57,720 --> 01:57:59,700
Maybe a secret license in Ultramix 3?

1723
01:57:59,700 --> 01:58:03,700
I don't know about that, but...

1724
01:58:03,700 --> 01:58:05,020
Alright.

1725
01:58:05,020 --> 01:58:08,860
Let's get into the Orange Zones Radio Cage Match tonight, shall we boys and girls?

1726
01:58:08,860 --> 01:58:12,060
It is about that time.

1727
01:58:12,060 --> 01:58:19,620
The way the cage match works is a reminder, we're going to play three songs for you guys. You kids get to vote for your favorite song, but you have to be in the chat room to vote.

1728
01:58:19,620 --> 01:58:22,860
You do, or else you're going to lose.

1729
01:58:22,860 --> 01:58:27,260
Anyway, so we're going to do the chat room tonight, three songs in the cage match.

1730
01:58:27,260 --> 01:58:30,260
You only get to hear a clip of last week's winner though,

1731
01:58:30,260 --> 01:58:31,860
because you already heard it last week.

1732
01:58:31,860 --> 01:58:35,460
And it actually won two weeks in a row now, so it's going for its third win.

1733
01:58:35,460 --> 01:58:39,900
The group is called Pendulum, and the song is called Hold Your Color.

1734
01:58:39,900 --> 01:58:42,780
And it's song number one you can vote for in tonight's cage match, so get ready.

1735
01:58:42,780 --> 01:58:45,940
Here comes the clip of song number one, Pendulum with Hold Your Color.

1736
01:58:45,940 --> 01:59:13,940
When they take everything away Hold your colors against the wall

1737
02:00:13,940 --> 02:00:19,940
When they take everything away

1738
02:00:19,940 --> 02:00:28,940
I want you just to get away

1739
02:00:28,940 --> 02:00:56,940
I keep looking into your eyes

1740
02:00:56,940 --> 02:01:01,940
So I laid the name, try to make a sound

1741
02:01:01,940 --> 02:01:08,940
The circle is gonna reach, reaching out and to see you

1742
02:01:08,940 --> 02:01:13,940
Nothing else can touch me

1743
02:01:13,940 --> 02:01:18,940
So can't turn around to come

1744
02:01:21,940 --> 02:01:24,940
Alright, that was song number one

1745
02:01:24,940 --> 02:01:28,140
last week's winner pendulum withhold your color

1746
02:01:28,140 --> 02:01:31,860
alright we're gonna get into song number two tonight and song number two comes to

1747
02:01:31,860 --> 02:01:32,820
us courtesy

1748
02:01:32,820 --> 02:01:36,700
of Loki what did you pick for us tonight

1749
02:01:36,700 --> 02:01:40,580
I picked as I promised last week

1750
02:01:40,580 --> 02:01:46,060
I picked pendulum again

1751
02:01:46,060 --> 02:01:47,180
there's no rules about this

1752
02:01:47,180 --> 02:01:50,300
this is slam by pendulum

1753
02:01:50,300 --> 02:01:53,500
I was gonna edit in the intro but then I realized that the song would be too long

1754
02:01:53,500 --> 02:02:00,500
As a reminder, last week, Loki was pissed that Pendulum won, so he decided to put another Pendulum song in.

1755
02:02:00,500 --> 02:02:03,500
It lost! So he's doing it again!

1756
02:02:04,500 --> 02:02:05,500
So?

1757
02:02:05,500 --> 02:02:09,500
I'm gonna make a rule. We're gonna make a rule. Jamie and I are gonna get together and make a rule and outvote your ass.

1758
02:02:09,500 --> 02:02:14,500
Like, no more Pendulum and Cage Match ever, or something, and then Shane will be mad at you because it'll be your fault.

1759
02:02:14,500 --> 02:02:15,500
It's not gonna be my fault.

1760
02:02:15,500 --> 02:02:16,500
It'll be your fault.

1761
02:02:16,500 --> 02:02:19,500
That's fine, I'll just put other- I'll put girls in again.

1762
02:02:19,500 --> 02:02:21,500
Aw, shit. Alright.

1763
02:02:21,500 --> 02:02:28,260
here it is song number two in tonight's cage match pendulum with slam

1764
02:03:21,500 --> 02:03:23,500
But tonight

1765
02:03:24,500 --> 02:03:26,500
On this small planet

1766
02:04:56,500 --> 02:05:03,500
Is this bass really strung up?

1767
02:05:26,500 --> 02:05:54,500
We're a maroon on a small island In an endless sea

1768
02:05:54,500 --> 02:06:00,500
Confined to a Chinese bit of fear, unable to escape.

1769
02:06:00,500 --> 02:06:05,500
But you know it, it's heavy stuff

1770
02:08:00,500 --> 02:08:07,500
and

1771
02:08:13,460 --> 02:08:17,500
song number two in tonight's cage match pendulum with slam let's see

1772
02:08:17,500 --> 02:08:20,900
uh... was that song slamming or do you want to slam that song into the ground

1773
02:08:20,900 --> 02:08:21,860
loki

1774
02:08:21,860 --> 02:08:25,860
in the ten because you can drive with that song really loud on your radio

1775
02:08:25,860 --> 02:08:28,820
it's all has a lot of bass in it

1776
02:08:28,820 --> 02:08:29,820
Angel.

1777
02:08:29,820 --> 02:08:34,820
Um, that makes me want to like, go kill Alliance now or something.

1778
02:08:34,820 --> 02:08:39,820
Sorry to lose it by Alliance, but um, God, this thing doesn't sound like it's on.

1779
02:08:39,820 --> 02:08:40,820
Huh!

1780
02:08:40,820 --> 02:08:41,820
It's on.

1781
02:08:41,820 --> 02:08:42,820
Okay.

1782
02:08:42,820 --> 02:08:43,820
No.

1783
02:08:43,820 --> 02:08:44,820
Um.

1784
02:08:44,820 --> 02:08:45,820
Ah hell.

1785
02:08:45,820 --> 02:08:46,820
Save it.

1786
02:08:48,820 --> 02:08:49,820
I got bored.

1787
02:08:49,820 --> 02:08:50,820
Three.

1788
02:08:50,820 --> 02:08:51,820
Extra room.

1789
02:08:51,820 --> 02:08:54,820
Um, I kind of got bored too.

1790
02:08:54,820 --> 02:09:02,820
Um, but Loki did make a good point that this would be a good song to blast out here at Harvard.

1791
02:09:02,820 --> 02:09:05,820
Yeah, if you want to put the other people on the road to sleep.

1792
02:09:05,820 --> 02:09:08,820
Well, unless, you don't knock it till you've tried it.

1793
02:09:08,820 --> 02:09:09,820
Okay.

1794
02:09:09,820 --> 02:09:11,820
Alright, so I give it an 8 for that.

1795
02:09:11,820 --> 02:09:13,820
Alright.

1796
02:09:13,820 --> 02:09:17,820
Remember, it's not our thoughts that count, it's yours. You have the final say.

1797
02:09:17,820 --> 02:09:19,820
Here's song number 3 in tonight's Cage Match.

1798
02:09:19,820 --> 02:09:25,140

1800
02:09:29,180 --> 02:09:35,240

extreme USA it's junior senior remember them they did move your feet this is

coconuts to this song. It's song number three in tonight's skating match. Enjoy.

1804
02:11:15,540 --> 02:11:17,540
Hands in the air

1805
02:11:17,540 --> 02:11:20,540
Hey boys and girls, we want to see what you've got

1806

We wanna see you shaking coconut

1807

We'll get up to speak some music

1808
02:11:41,540 --> 02:11:44,540
We'll get down to present time

1809
02:12:14,540 --> 02:12:23,180
Alright, song number three in tonight's cage match, junior-senior with Shake Your Coconuts.

1810
02:12:23,180 --> 02:12:25,180
Did you shake your coconuts?

1811
02:12:25,180 --> 02:12:26,620
Or was that song just nuts?

1812
02:12:26,620 --> 02:12:27,620
I don't know.

1813
02:12:27,620 --> 02:12:28,620
Loki.

1814
02:12:28,620 --> 02:12:29,620
Get Loki and Mike.

1815
02:12:29,620 --> 02:12:30,620
That was lame.

1816
02:12:30,620 --> 02:12:32,620
That was really lame.

1817
02:12:32,620 --> 02:12:35,340
That was awful lame.

1818
02:12:35,340 --> 02:12:37,340
It kids of four.

1819
02:12:37,340 --> 02:12:38,340
Angel.

1820
02:12:38,340 --> 02:12:42,340
It was okay.

1821
02:12:42,340 --> 02:12:50,340
I don't mind that song, but, um, no, six-and-a-half.

1822
02:12:50,340 --> 02:12:52,340
Ex-defirm.

1823
02:12:52,340 --> 02:12:58,340
Forgive me for saying this, but I felt like busting a nut.

1824
02:12:58,340 --> 02:13:01,340
God damn it, I hate you!

1825
02:13:01,340 --> 02:13:05,340
They said shake your coconut till the nut comes out or something like that.

1826
02:13:05,340 --> 02:13:06,340
I think so, yes.

1827
02:13:06,340 --> 02:13:10,340
That's pretty foul. I give it, like I said, for that.

1828
02:13:10,340 --> 02:13:16,340
But vote for song 2, because we don't want song 1 to win, because I'm behind Loki's whole team here.

1829
02:13:16,340 --> 02:13:17,340
Holy shit up.

1830
02:13:18,340 --> 02:13:27,340
I thought that song was awesome, you know why? Because it wasn't Pendulum, so therefore it gets an 8 automatically, because it was awesome for not being Pendulum.

1831
02:13:27,340 --> 02:13:30,340
I don't think 8 really translates to Awesome Log.

1832
02:13:30,340 --> 02:13:32,340
It's not Orgasmic.

1833
02:13:32,340 --> 02:13:34,340
No, no, no, I don't think it really does.

1834
02:13:34,340 --> 02:13:35,340
Shut up.

1835
02:13:35,340 --> 02:13:36,340
Orgasmic could be 11.

1836
02:13:36,340 --> 02:13:37,340
Shut up.

1837
02:13:37,340 --> 02:13:42,780
Let's recap the songs you can vote for in tonight's cage match.

1838
02:13:42,780 --> 02:13:46,900
Song number one is Pendulum with Hold Your Color.

1839
02:13:46,900 --> 02:13:56,100
It's last week's winner.

1840
02:13:56,100 --> 02:14:11,660
And song number two you can vote for in tonight's cage match is Slam.

1841
02:14:11,660 --> 02:14:18,500

1843
02:14:31,220 --> 02:14:32,220
let you know who won.

1844
02:14:32,220 --> 02:14:33,700
Remember, it's not up to us.

1845
02:14:33,700 --> 02:14:36,340
We're just big idiots on the-

1846
02:14:36,340 --> 02:14:37,900
We're like American Idol judges.

1847
02:14:37,900 --> 02:14:40,900
Yeah, kind of, and it really isn't up to us.

1848
02:14:40,900 --> 02:14:42,540
You would be Paula Abdul.

1849
02:14:42,540 --> 02:14:43,820
I'm not Paula Abdul.

1850
02:14:43,820 --> 02:14:46,380
You're totally the Paula Abdul.

1851
02:14:46,380 --> 02:14:48,980
I'm Randy. Dog.

1852
02:14:48,980 --> 02:14:54,180
What up, dog? What up, dog? What's up, dog pound? I can't stand that fucking show

1853
02:14:54,180 --> 02:15:00,420
right now. You watch it every year! I know, and the thing is it's just like TV crack.

1854
02:15:00,420 --> 02:15:01,860
You know, it's like

1855
02:15:01,860 --> 02:15:05,540
you have to watch something that's kind of a guilty pleasure

1856
02:15:05,540 --> 02:15:08,820
that you can't stand, but you watch it anyway.

1857
02:15:08,820 --> 02:15:10,260
Kind of like Jerry Springer.

1858
02:15:10,260 --> 02:15:12,520
Ringmaster was on TV today. I had to watch it.

1859
02:15:12,520 --> 02:15:13,900
It was some of it.

1860
02:15:13,900 --> 02:15:17,600
because I actually saw Ringmaster in the theater the day it opened

1861
02:15:17,600 --> 02:15:21,600
four people in the theater

1862
02:15:21,600 --> 02:15:24,880
me and my roommate at the time and some other schmoes

1863
02:15:24,880 --> 02:15:29,080
was that Loki? no it wasn't Loki, no it was, Ringmaster opened up like when I was in college

1864
02:15:29,080 --> 02:15:29,960
it was years ago

1865
02:15:29,960 --> 02:15:33,280
years ago yeah I never saw it

1866
02:15:33,280 --> 02:15:37,140
I never saw it. Jerry Springer is still on the show

1867
02:15:37,140 --> 02:15:41,520
you still got a show yeah so does Maury

1868
02:15:41,520 --> 02:15:45,320
That's Maury. Why? I don't know. Who watches Maury?

1869
02:15:45,320 --> 02:15:50,640
Maury's got a very, it's got a very fine schedule to it too. It's like Mondays

1870
02:15:50,640 --> 02:15:53,880
is I don't believe you my baby daddy.

1871
02:15:53,880 --> 02:15:57,880
Day two is send my kids to boot camp.

1872
02:15:57,880 --> 02:16:01,720
Day three is my baby fat.

1873
02:16:01,720 --> 02:16:06,240
Day four would be I know I'm fat but I'm gorgeous.

1874
02:16:06,240 --> 02:16:11,000
How many times have you accidentally found yourself channel surfing and

1875
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:15,000
The channel lands on Maury Povich, and it's about their baby being fat.

1876
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:19,000
It's like, dude, stop feeding your kid!

1877
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:23,000
Like, shit!

1878
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:27,000
And we're supposed to feel sympathy. The mom's like,

1879
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:31,000
I don't know what to do! Fuck, bitch, stop feeding your kid!

1880
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:35,000
I suppose we should get

1881
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:39,000
into the- do you have a movie review for us tonight, Ecstifer? I forgot to ask.

1882
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:43,900
Christopher, I forgot to mention, our work, because, you know, I worked at a video distributor,

1883
02:16:43,900 --> 02:16:50,900
Wednesday we get, in our theater, we get to watch Serenity. So, for free. And we get pizza!

1884
02:16:50,900 --> 02:16:53,900
That is double awesome! Well, I hope you enjoy it.

1885
02:16:53,900 --> 02:16:57,900
And, you know, seeing Serenity for free is about the only way people are seeing it these

1886
02:16:57,900 --> 02:17:03,140
days, apparently, because the movie's not making any money right now.

1887
02:17:03,140 --> 02:17:05,700
That is very funny to you, isn't it?

1888
02:17:05,700 --> 02:17:07,020
Statistic bitch.

1889
02:17:07,020 --> 02:17:15,340
No, but I saw it for free, actually, a couple months ago, maybe, a month and a half, and

1890
02:17:15,340 --> 02:17:19,900
it was really good free, but it was also good when I paid money, so, you know.

1891
02:17:19,900 --> 02:17:20,900
Yeah.

1892
02:17:20,900 --> 02:17:21,900
All right.

1893
02:17:21,900 --> 02:17:24,660
Are you going to do a movie review for us tonight?

1894
02:17:24,660 --> 02:17:25,660
Sure.

1895
02:17:25,660 --> 02:17:27,100
I'll think up a movie review.

1896
02:17:27,100 --> 02:17:30,940
I haven't seen really any movies this week, so I'll think up one.

1897
02:17:30,940 --> 02:17:33,820
please don't play the game music

1898
02:17:33,820 --> 02:17:37,540
so you know if you're going to be later my family's been watching desperate

1899
02:17:37,540 --> 02:17:39,780
housewives of god

1900
02:17:39,780 --> 02:17:43,580
she's jumped on that thing going on

1901
02:17:43,580 --> 02:17:45,660
everybody pity me

1902
02:17:45,660 --> 02:17:48,980
next thing you know it's gonna be lost to

1903
02:17:48,980 --> 02:17:52,700
like this bitch watches every week we have the season one box that it's in my

1904
02:17:52,700 --> 02:17:58,300
pile of stuff that's going to be returned to games up for games

1905
02:17:58,300 --> 02:18:02,300
Yeah, we have lost, and she wants to watch that too. I'm like, noooo.

1906
02:18:02,300 --> 02:18:08,300
Um, we need to get to your sim update, Loki. What's going on in the sim scene?

1907
02:18:08,300 --> 02:18:12,300
Okay, okay, I actually do have the story now about that stupid Button Mash Revolution thing.

1908
02:18:12,300 --> 02:18:16,300
Um, finally found it because, you know, PSP updates hide their shit.

1909
02:18:16,300 --> 02:18:21,300
Anyways, it's this game called Button Mash Revolution version 1. It's for the PSP.

1910
02:18:21,300 --> 02:18:25,300
You can only run it if you have a version 1.5, um, firmware.

1911
02:18:25,300 --> 02:18:29,940
And basically, it's like DDR except you use your buttons, there are no arrows instead,

1912
02:18:29,940 --> 02:18:35,020
there are the four corresponding buttons that are on the PSP, and there's music in it, and

1913
02:18:35,020 --> 02:18:37,180
someone made it in Lua.

1914
02:18:37,180 --> 02:18:40,460
So I don't really know what kind of music is in it, because I haven't downloaded it

1915
02:18:40,460 --> 02:18:44,540
yet, but it looks kind of fun, so if you're looking for something to waste some space

1916
02:18:44,540 --> 02:18:48,320
in your memory card, check it out at pspupdates.com.

1917
02:18:48,320 --> 02:18:53,180
You're going to have to actually, it's going to be tough to find, but it's Button Mash

1918
02:18:53,180 --> 02:19:00,220
Revolution version 1. And that's one thing. The other thing that's worth mentioning is

1919
02:19:00,220 --> 02:19:07,520
actually a game that's kind of on the internet right now. It's made by the creators of Easy

1920
02:19:07,520 --> 02:19:14,440
to DJ and it's called DJ Max. Now they have DJ Max Portable which is coming to the PSP

1921
02:19:14,440 --> 02:19:19,420
in December and it's actually very similar to Beatmania. Very similar to Beatmania. So

1922
02:19:19,420 --> 02:19:23,020
So this is definitely going to be one I'm going to be checking out as soon as it comes

1923
02:19:23,020 --> 02:19:24,020
out.

1924
02:19:24,020 --> 02:19:26,020
But they do have some screenshots.

1925
02:19:26,020 --> 02:19:29,140
It looks amazing so far.

1926
02:19:29,140 --> 02:19:32,900
Just be really awesome to see some more music games coming to the PSP.

1927
02:19:32,900 --> 02:19:40,540
And if you want to check out the website, I believe it's djmaxx.com, but I'm not positive.

1928
02:19:40,540 --> 02:19:45,580
Just search for DJ Maxx and I'm sure you'll find it.

1929
02:19:45,580 --> 02:19:50,260
other than that, really, um, I don't think there's too much else going on in the sim scene.

1930
02:19:50,260 --> 02:19:54,380
I haven't been really paying attention to the sim scene because

1931
02:19:54,380 --> 02:19:57,260
nothing really interesting has been going on for me.

1932
02:19:57,260 --> 02:20:03,260
You know, tournaments and stuff, just like, eh, don't care.

1933
02:20:03,260 --> 02:20:04,740
Well, I'm glad you're, um,

1934
02:20:04,740 --> 02:20:09,220
a faithful reporter in the sim industry. There's really nothing going on, honestly, I mean,

1935
02:20:09,220 --> 02:20:13,020
I'm sure if Mysore had their sim section up, they'd be more crappy remixes of

1936
02:20:13,020 --> 02:20:17,660
Max, but unfortunately I can't report on that because there is no sim section anymore. I

1937
02:20:17,660 --> 02:20:24,660
do know of a new torrent site that came up though that has some stuff on it, but yeah.

1938
02:20:24,900 --> 02:20:29,500
That's about it. I'm more interested in checking out Ultramix 3 when that comes out in a couple

1939
02:20:29,500 --> 02:20:34,580
weeks. This was all my 360 games becoming at the same time.

1940
02:20:34,580 --> 02:20:38,580
I know, I gotta save my money for the 360. I'm not looking forward to spending that kind

1941
02:20:38,580 --> 02:20:40,700
of money, but what can you do?

1942
02:20:40,700 --> 02:20:49,700
I'm gonna be getting my controllers. I've got about four games lined up, just, you know, with all the store credit I've, you know, earned in the last few months, and just fun stuff like that.

1943
02:20:49,700 --> 02:20:57,700
And hopefully, because not all that stuff's first party, hopefully I can hit up some of our publishers and go, hey, can you send me a free copy? Hey, come on.

1944
02:20:57,700 --> 02:21:05,700
Xbox Live, they're taking it down for a day to do some, like, adjustments or something. So, are they gonna have the Xbox 360, like, interface on the regular Xbox or something?

1945
02:21:05,700 --> 02:21:06,700
Xbox or something?

1946
02:21:06,700 --> 02:21:07,700
I don't know.

1947
02:21:07,700 --> 02:21:09,980
Well, they're taking down Live because they're updating everything.

1948
02:21:09,980 --> 02:21:12,780
They're going to actually have a website now where you can download all your stats and

1949
02:21:12,780 --> 02:21:16,540
everything on Live and people can actually view all that stuff, what games you're playing,

1950
02:21:16,540 --> 02:21:18,660
what accomplishments you've done.

1951
02:21:18,660 --> 02:21:22,420
They've been announcing more stuff for the Xbox Live Arcade, the new one being Tetris

1952
02:21:22,420 --> 02:21:28,500
is now on there because Tetris is on every system on the man, and just lots of cool stuff

1953
02:21:28,500 --> 02:21:30,020
they're doing for Live.

1954
02:21:30,020 --> 02:21:33,940
I'm hoping that they're not using the same gamer tags, though, because I really want

1955
02:21:33,940 --> 02:21:36,540
and they're like, first thing to get Loki, but...

1956
02:21:36,540 --> 02:21:39,920
Yeah, I'm wondering if they're going to carry the gamertags over, because...

1957
02:21:39,920 --> 02:21:43,660
I don't think... I wouldn't think so, but... It would be interesting if they did. They might, who knows?

1958
02:21:43,660 --> 02:21:47,380
Yeah, I think they would have to for the backwards compatibility thing. I think they'd have to.

1959
02:21:47,380 --> 02:21:51,140
Maybe. Well, that's okay. I have a backup name just in case, so... What's that?

1960
02:21:51,140 --> 02:21:53,440
I can't say, because someone's going to steal it.

1961
02:21:53,440 --> 02:21:54,780
Oh, okay.

1962
02:21:54,780 --> 02:21:59,440
It's not too far from, you know, the name I go by, but...

1963
02:21:59,440 --> 02:22:05,880
like super Loki? Loki6969 slide?

1964
02:22:05,880 --> 02:22:11,800
No. Don't say my frickin' World of Warcraft name on error.

1965
02:22:11,800 --> 02:22:16,120
Or, um, you know, close enough. He doesn't have a mic, it doesn't matter.

1966
02:22:16,120 --> 02:22:18,360
This is a good thing.

1967
02:22:18,360 --> 02:22:19,680
Okay, um,

1968
02:22:19,680 --> 02:22:22,840
let's get to Extrovert's movie review before we get to a break.

1969
02:22:22,840 --> 02:22:27,200
You don't have a movie yet? Okay, fine, we'll have to go to a break.

1970
02:22:27,200 --> 02:22:34,200
We are going to play some other music this break, because we have been doing Captain Jack most of the night, but we want to work in some other stuff.

1971
02:22:34,200 --> 02:22:39,200
I've actually had a few requests for some other songs some folks want to hear tonight, so I want to get to some of those.

1972
02:22:39,200 --> 02:22:45,200
So I think we'll do a little bit of 2DX music this break, and we'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.

1973
02:22:45,200 --> 02:22:51,200
We're going to get into the FUs of the week, and if we're feeling like it, maybe a little bit of Ask Orange Lounge, if you're lucky.

1974
02:22:51,200 --> 02:22:58,200
We'll be back after this with more Orange Launch Video.

1975
02:23:51,200 --> 02:23:55,200
and

1976
02:23:55,200 --> 02:23:59,200
and

1977
02:23:59,200 --> 02:24:03,200
and

1978
02:24:03,200 --> 02:24:07,200
and

1979
02:24:07,200 --> 02:24:11,200
and

1980
02:24:11,200 --> 02:24:15,200
and

1981
02:24:15,200 --> 02:24:19,200
and

1982
02:24:49,200 --> 02:25:10,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah You must be, you must be, you must be

1983
02:25:10,800 --> 02:25:12,800
You know they mean the best of my balls

1984
02:25:25,300 --> 02:25:27,300
Two chicks a-nakin' with the beef

1985
02:25:32,300 --> 02:25:34,300
Two chicks a-nakin' with the beef

1986
02:25:37,300 --> 02:25:40,300
You're gonna make me feel like you're not even free

1987
02:25:40,300 --> 02:25:47,300
Don't make me feel that you're loving me now

1988
02:26:17,300 --> 02:26:21,300
Wherever I want to go

1989
02:26:24,300 --> 02:26:28,300
I must be there to say

1990
02:26:58,300 --> 02:27:00,300
You

1991
02:28:28,300 --> 02:28:30,300
Yay!

1992
02:28:58,300 --> 02:29:07,300
I'm burning up for you, I'm burning up for you

1993
02:29:28,300 --> 02:29:39,300
I'm gonna be my masterful but I need you to be with you

1994
02:29:39,300 --> 02:29:43,300
To make a sky more than a moon

1995
02:29:43,300 --> 02:29:48,300
Hey, I know that I'm losing you tonight

1996
02:29:48,300 --> 02:29:51,300
I want something else

1997
02:29:51,300 --> 02:29:55,300
I'm trying to get through

1998
02:29:55,300 --> 02:30:02,300
I'm burning up for you, I'm burning up for you

1999
02:30:02,300 --> 02:30:07,300
I'm burning every time that I look at you

2000
02:30:07,300 --> 02:30:14,300
I'm burning up for you, I'm burning up for you

2001
02:30:14,300 --> 02:30:22,300
I don't know anybody the way I do

2002
02:30:22,300 --> 02:30:47,580
So uncensored that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.

2003
02:30:47,580 --> 02:30:54,580
the

2004
02:30:55,180 --> 02:30:55,880
alone

2005
02:30:55,880 --> 02:30:58,780
we're back here on orange lounge radio

2006
02:30:58,780 --> 02:31:02,140
just having ourselves a good old time on this sunday evening thank you for

2007
02:31:02,140 --> 02:31:05,780
deciding to tune in and listen to us we appreciate it

2008
02:31:05,780 --> 02:31:08,140
although i'm kinda tired today i'm just like uh...

2009
02:31:08,140 --> 02:31:11,700
kind of uh... sluggish i know it's a lazy sunday

2010
02:31:11,700 --> 02:31:13,820
of course we were up like totally late last night

2011
02:31:13,820 --> 02:31:18,020
And I've been doing a little drinking so maybe I didn't I watch to drink though

2012
02:31:18,020 --> 02:31:21,820
Maybe I have a little bit of a hangover. Maybe a little bit a little bit

2013
02:31:23,400 --> 02:31:27,620
We'll see um so I guess now is the part of the show where

2014
02:31:28,180 --> 02:31:30,540
I'm not going to do extra first movie review. Oh

2015
02:31:31,220 --> 02:31:33,460
Because I want to tell you guys who won tonight's cage match

2016
02:31:34,380 --> 02:31:36,520
Okay, which is certainly something we need to hear about

2017
02:31:37,100 --> 02:31:41,260
So the winner of tonight's cage match it was one vote deciding things tonight

2018
02:31:41,260 --> 02:31:45,960
you guys. It was a very, very close cage match, except for song number two, which got like

2019
02:31:45,960 --> 02:31:52,100
no votes. But the winning song by one vote in tonight's cage match is...

2020
02:31:52,100 --> 02:32:03,740
Tensellum, Hold Your Color. For the third week in a row next week, it goes for retirement.

2021
02:32:03,740 --> 02:32:08,540
If it is the winner next week, it will be retired and will be the first song to be retired

2022
02:32:08,540 --> 02:32:12,740
in quite a while. I think we had a song get retired by default, but I don't even remember

2023
02:32:12,740 --> 02:32:17,740
because we missed two shows, and so it kind of held over for four weeks. I want to say

2024
02:32:17,740 --> 02:32:22,980
it was something from Wangan or something. I don't remember, though. I think it was one

2025
02:32:22,980 --> 02:32:31,580
of Dark Soccer's songs. Maybe one of the people in chat remembers. Anyway, what we're going

2026
02:32:31,580 --> 02:32:35,940
to do now is we're going to get into Extrofer's movie review. Extrofer!

2027
02:32:35,940 --> 02:32:40,940
Hello. It's time for your movie reveal. Oh my god.

2028
02:32:40,940 --> 02:32:45,940
Play anything. Even the Madonna song. It's okay.

2029
02:32:45,940 --> 02:32:52,940
Okay. No. Okay. I spoke out of... I didn't mean to say that.

2030
02:32:52,940 --> 02:32:55,940
And I'm starting the review. You can't play the song now.

2031
02:32:55,940 --> 02:32:59,940
Okay. What are you going to be reviewing?

2032
02:32:59,940 --> 02:33:02,940
The movie I'm reviewing this week is Sphere.

2033
02:33:02,940 --> 02:33:07,060
Remember that movie, Terror Can Fill Any Space?

2034
02:33:07,060 --> 02:33:08,060
No.

2035
02:33:08,060 --> 02:33:09,060
Oh.

2036
02:33:09,060 --> 02:33:15,140
Well, that's what it says on the box art of Sphere, and it's from the best-selling author

2037
02:33:15,140 --> 02:33:21,460
of Jurassic Park and The Lost World, otherwise known as Michael Crichton.

2038
02:33:21,460 --> 02:33:23,460
Little info on some critics here.

2039
02:33:23,460 --> 02:33:30,020
Janet Maslin from the New York Times called it rich in techno terror, a solid thriller

2040
02:33:30,020 --> 02:33:35,020
directed with sustained tension. I'm not sure what Techno Terror is.

2041
02:33:35,020 --> 02:33:40,060
Well, I wasn't sure until I read that and I noticed it was on the back of this

2042
02:33:40,060 --> 02:33:45,620
case for Sphere. So I guess Sphere would be called Techno Terror.

2043
02:33:45,620 --> 02:33:53,140
Anyways, so I think Sphere was okay. I mean, it wasn't great, but if you want

2044
02:33:53,140 --> 02:33:57,660
to see Queen Latifah get killed by Jellyfish, then I guess that would be the

2045
02:33:57,660 --> 02:34:03,260
movie to watch like you know her getting killed by jellyfish Rob do you have

2046
02:34:03,260 --> 02:34:08,500
anything add to that from getting eaten by jellyfish to Pizza Hut commercials

2047
02:34:08,500 --> 02:34:12,460
yeah basically the movie the premise of the movie is that everybody's fears

2048
02:34:12,460 --> 02:34:16,940
manifest themselves and they're down and they're down under like deep deep deep

2049
02:34:16,940 --> 02:34:24,980
and you know and to the ocean or water or whatever and basically like people

2050
02:34:24,980 --> 02:34:28,420
get killed by their own fears, basically, and Queen Latifah is...

2051
02:34:28,420 --> 02:34:32,420
Hey, Exteror, can you hold on a minute?

2052
02:34:32,420 --> 02:34:35,420
Sorry, I'm rocking out a little bit.

2053
02:34:35,420 --> 02:34:37,420
Of course you are.

2054
02:34:37,420 --> 02:34:39,420
Okay, sorry, go ahead.

2055
02:34:39,420 --> 02:34:45,780
So, I'm sorry, I just got stupid just then, because you played that song.

2056
02:34:45,780 --> 02:34:51,020
No, so the movie basically is really average.

2057
02:34:51,020 --> 02:34:59,660
I would give it a thumb sideways because, you know, I'd give it an apathetic thumb anywhere

2058
02:34:59,660 --> 02:35:01,820
because I don't really care.

2059
02:35:01,820 --> 02:35:06,060
And you know, again, Queen Latifah died from jellyfish in it.

2060
02:35:06,060 --> 02:35:12,060
Again, I'd like to reiterate, she died from jellyfish, she was like, oh my God, I got

2061
02:35:12,060 --> 02:35:15,860
killed by some damn jellyfish.

2062
02:35:15,860 --> 02:35:20,900
Oh my God, I got to do Pizza Hut commercials and I have to do bringing down the house with

2063
02:35:20,900 --> 02:35:24,900
Steve Martin in a few years. I can't die from them damn jellyfish?

2064
02:35:24,900 --> 02:35:26,900
And don't forget Chicago.

2065
02:35:26,900 --> 02:35:27,900
Chicago too!

2066
02:35:27,900 --> 02:35:29,900
When you're good to momma, momma's good to you, remember?

2067
02:35:29,900 --> 02:35:31,900
That's right.

2068
02:35:31,900 --> 02:35:33,900
She said...

2069
02:35:33,900 --> 02:35:35,900
Damn... God damn jellyfish.

2070
02:35:35,900 --> 02:35:37,900
No, the jellyfish, that was really funny.

2071
02:35:37,900 --> 02:35:40,900
And she's like, she acts really scared in it. It's great.

2072
02:35:40,900 --> 02:35:42,900
That's the best scene in the movie.

2073
02:35:42,900 --> 02:35:44,900
Ooh, Queen Latifah getting eaten by jellyfish.

2074
02:35:44,900 --> 02:35:45,900
Yeah, being eaten by jellyfish.

2075
02:35:45,900 --> 02:35:46,900
So...

2076
02:35:46,900 --> 02:35:50,900
So, Spierer gets his apathetic thumb, but Queen Latifah getting eaten by jellyfish is what I'm saying.

2077
02:35:50,900 --> 02:35:55,900
That is really the high point of the movie. It's really kind of at the beginning, so I would recommend that part.

2078
02:35:55,900 --> 02:36:01,900
So, I'm glad you listened to my little, you know, segment here. It was so interesting.

2079
02:36:03,900 --> 02:36:05,900
Listen tomorrow. It's my new show.

2080
02:36:05,900 --> 02:36:08,900
I'm rocking out. I'm rocking out. See, you're gay ABBA.

2081
02:36:08,900 --> 02:36:09,900
It's not my gay ABBA.

2082
02:36:09,900 --> 02:36:11,900
Yeah, you're gay ABBA.

2083
02:36:11,900 --> 02:36:19,900
I still say there should be a machine called the ABBA, like an ABB machine.

2084
02:36:19,900 --> 02:36:24,900
Every single time you crunch, it'll play a little bit of Dancing Queen or something.

2085
02:36:24,900 --> 02:36:25,900
Okay.

2086
02:36:25,900 --> 02:36:32,900
Or it'll go, dee dee dee dee dee, like as you crunch it.

2087
02:36:32,900 --> 02:36:36,900
I think it's about time that we get into the Orange Launch Radio Cage match.

2088
02:36:36,900 --> 02:36:38,900
I think we're starting to get into that portion of the show.

2089
02:36:38,900 --> 02:36:41,860
I'm sure some of you guys are starting to get a little angsty you guys

2090
02:36:43,700 --> 02:36:46,680
That's the cage man, yeah, I'm sorry if use the week

2091
02:36:48,140 --> 02:36:51,060
It's one of those nights. I don't give a fuck tonight. I really don't

2092
02:36:52,980 --> 02:36:57,500
That's right, we're gonna get into the F use the week because we're angsty maybe we're angsty because of cage match

2093
02:36:57,500 --> 02:36:59,500
I don't know. But anyway, um

2094
02:37:00,820 --> 02:37:04,940
Dark soccer isn't here tonight, but usually this is the part of the show where I would say dark soccer

2095
02:37:04,940 --> 02:37:08,300
So why is it we do the FUs of the Week every single week and then what would she say?

2096
02:37:08,300 --> 02:37:10,620
Something like, uh, because we're angsty?

2097
02:37:10,620 --> 02:37:22,980
No, she says grr argh, right?

2098
02:37:22,980 --> 02:37:27,460
DarkSakura did leave a little message for me on AOL because she was a little bit angsty.

2099
02:37:27,460 --> 02:37:31,380
She said, had the most retarded field trip for school today.

2100
02:37:31,380 --> 02:37:33,020
That's my FU.

2101
02:37:33,020 --> 02:37:34,740
Retarded field trips.

2102
02:37:34,740 --> 02:37:41,200
I didn't know you got to go on field trips in college. Maybe I should have finished.

2103
02:37:41,200 --> 02:37:45,800
Loki, what's your FUs of the week?

2104
02:37:45,800 --> 02:37:51,220
Um, my first FU goes to, um, super driver's out there because you're driving too damn slow

2105
02:37:51,220 --> 02:37:52,380
and getting in my way.

2106
02:37:52,380 --> 02:37:58,180
Um, my other FU goes to my apartment complex for deciding to repave the entire, um,

2107
02:37:58,180 --> 02:37:59,900
parking lot and basically

2108
02:37:59,900 --> 02:38:04,100
rearrange some of the parking spaces and putting in some brand new handicapped ones because the handicapped

2109
02:38:04,100 --> 02:38:08,500
people have, like, all these 15 spaces that they can park in for all the two handicapped

2110
02:38:08,500 --> 02:38:13,140
people in our complex. And they have, they put them in some really stupid spots, like,

2111
02:38:13,140 --> 02:38:17,620
this one that's in this, um, one spot where the actual ramp to where the handicapped people

2112
02:38:17,620 --> 02:38:22,020
can go up is, like, way far away from it, and also the fact that there's a giant curve

2113
02:38:22,020 --> 02:38:26,880
in its way, so it's kind of pointless to have a ramp there anyways. So, my apartment complex

2114
02:38:26,880 --> 02:38:30,700
is retarded. And also, fuck you to these stupid kids that keep throwing this tennis ball against

2115
02:38:30,700 --> 02:38:33,820
dumpster and playing butts up

2116
02:38:33,820 --> 02:38:38,140
do what i remember butts up that game was awesome these kids need to go someplace so i stole

2117
02:38:38,140 --> 02:38:43,540
their tennis ball and it's in my house now but they bought another one so i had to steal that one too

2118
02:38:43,540 --> 02:38:44,740
you see this? this is mine now

2119
02:38:44,740 --> 02:38:46,460
this is mine now

2120
02:38:46,460 --> 02:38:48,820
exactly

2121
02:38:48,820 --> 02:38:50,340
freaking stupid people i hate them

2122
02:38:50,340 --> 02:38:55,020
and also uh... fuck you the stupid woman that basically uh... got all pissed off for

2123
02:38:55,020 --> 02:38:57,380
nelly having taken out her uh...

2124
02:38:57,380 --> 02:39:00,780
lottery they've been sitting in one of the washers just unattended

2125
02:39:00,780 --> 02:39:03,520
because there was a regarded cycle and she's off

2126
02:39:03,520 --> 02:39:07,020
where my clothes at

2127
02:39:07,020 --> 02:39:09,140
and she's like well they're in the basket

2128
02:39:09,140 --> 02:39:12,580
better not be stealing my clothes

2129
02:39:12,580 --> 02:39:17,460
and she had and she had her like freakin shower cap on and stuff

2130
02:39:17,460 --> 02:39:21,620
total ghetto woman you should have threatened them with some jellyfish

2131
02:39:21,620 --> 02:39:23,160
where my clothes at

2132
02:39:23,160 --> 02:39:28,380
I can tell you this much, I'd be handling the situation differently if it were me

2133
02:39:28,380 --> 02:39:32,880
you know, if I was in there, I'd be, you know, she'd be like, where my clothes at, and I'd be like

2134
02:39:32,880 --> 02:39:35,960
talking English, bitch!

2135
02:39:35,960 --> 02:39:37,360
So, yeah.

2136
02:39:37,360 --> 02:39:44,360
That's my effusive week.

2137
02:39:46,580 --> 02:39:51,080
I'm relatively angst free. I got most of my angst out in my live journal earlier this week

2138
02:39:51,080 --> 02:39:54,680
because that's what live journals for is for me me me's I know they're called

2139
02:39:54,680 --> 02:39:59,980
maims or whatever but I call me me's live drills for me me's and me venting

2140
02:39:59,980 --> 02:40:02,960
once in a while so I've got actually got most of it out of my system so I feel

2141
02:40:02,960 --> 02:40:10,400
pretty good but just an F you to like three days this week I ended up staying

2142
02:40:10,400 --> 02:40:13,720
at work like way later than I was originally intending to and I don't like

2143
02:40:13,720 --> 02:40:19,680
that but F you two dumbasses in World of Warcraft because there's been a couple

2144
02:40:19,680 --> 02:40:24,680
that kind of pissed me off. A nephew to the fact that I haven't gotten onto other servers yet, but I swear I'm going to at some point.

2145
02:40:24,680 --> 02:40:31,680
Um, and a nephew to, um, me having to save money for an Xbox 360, because I don't like being poor.

2146
02:40:31,680 --> 02:40:33,680
Being poor sucks.

2147
02:40:33,680 --> 02:40:34,680
That's it.

2148
02:40:34,680 --> 02:40:39,680
Um, let's get to Angel and Angel's FUs of the Week.

2149
02:40:39,680 --> 02:40:42,680
Oh, let's see.

2150
02:40:42,680 --> 02:40:57,680
Yeah, I'm still kind of pretty pissed off at my computer even though it works now, so F you to that, because if it hadn't broken down I would be level 40 by now, because, um, yeah, damn level requirements for guilds, Jesus!

2151
02:40:57,680 --> 02:41:04,680
Speaking of which, I have to hit level 50 by next Tuesday, so maybe to that, too, because I don't even know if I'm gonna make it.

2152
02:41:04,680 --> 02:41:13,680
Other than that... Oh, yeah, I've been having to go to school four days a week now. Ouch.

2153
02:41:13,680 --> 02:41:22,680
But it must be done. Why? Because then I can get a better job later on or something, or whatever you're supposed to do after you go to school.

2154
02:41:22,680 --> 02:41:28,680
Okay, that's really it. I'm not really that pissy this week or something.

2155
02:41:28,680 --> 02:41:33,680
So, um, yeah, until next time.

2156
02:41:33,680 --> 02:41:37,680
Xtaphir, what are your FUs of the week?

2157
02:41:37,680 --> 02:41:42,680
Um, FU to God, because if you really do exist, you're fucking with my week.

2158
02:41:42,680 --> 02:41:46,680
I mean, Jesus Christ, God.

2159
02:41:46,680 --> 02:41:52,940
I am so fucking pissed off because like I like you know will be very very fine

2160
02:41:52,940 --> 02:41:57,360
and everything then I go to the lab and I try to give blood and suddenly I almost

2161
02:41:57,360 --> 02:42:01,120
faint you were trying to give blood I mean I was trying to get blood work done

2162
02:42:01,120 --> 02:42:05,280
and now I have to go back to the lab because they couldn't do enough work and

2163
02:42:05,280 --> 02:42:10,960
you know just more you know stuff that I have to like think about doing so yeah

2164
02:42:10,960 --> 02:42:22,960
Yeah, so F you to that. F you to, like, just last week in general. I don't know. It was just a really difficult week.

2165
02:42:22,960 --> 02:42:31,960
No, actually, you know, it ended really well. I mean, we had a good night last night. Good partay-ing. Partaking in a partay.

2166
02:42:31,960 --> 02:42:33,960
It was neat.

2167
02:42:33,960 --> 02:42:35,960
It was nifty.

2168
02:42:35,960 --> 02:42:37,960
But otherwise, yeah.

2169
02:42:37,960 --> 02:42:42,960
Otherwise, after you, everyone who won't listen to my show tomorrow, at 7 o'clock,

Will you be playing Madonna hung up on your show?

2172
02:42:47,960 --> 02:42:48,960
I will not be playing.

2173
02:42:48,960 --> 02:42:49,960
I'm going to request this.

2174
02:42:49,960 --> 02:42:51,960
I will not be playing that song.

2175
02:42:51,960 --> 02:42:54,960
You know, I haven't even talked about the Rob Roberts show on Wednesday,

Gloatwalk says F you to the coat hanger in the handicap stall in the bathroom at my workplace.

2192
02:44:51,520 --> 02:44:55,240
That damn thing was placed so low it practically punctured my right arm and I've got a huge

2193
02:44:55,240 --> 02:44:58,040
honking bruise the size of two silver dollars.

2194

Color of Sakura says F you to the fact that I was diagnosed with a peptic ulcer last week

2196
02:45:36,560 --> 02:45:47,800
And are they all chain letters?

2197
02:45:47,800 --> 02:45:48,800
I hate that shit.

2198
02:45:48,800 --> 02:45:49,800
Me too.

2199
02:45:49,800 --> 02:45:52,180
That's why I'm kinda glad Myspace exists, because that's where all the chain letters

2200
02:45:52,180 --> 02:45:53,180
go now.

2201
02:45:53,180 --> 02:45:59,700
GS191 says, F you to Tommy Tallarco for giving Weehart Katamari a fucking 3 out of 10.

2202
02:45:59,700 --> 02:46:03,820
F you to my friend for bricking his PSP, he deserved it, and a continuing F you to my

2203
02:46:03,820 --> 02:46:05,320
online math class.

02:46:05,320 --> 02:46:08,160
A three out of ten for Weheart Katamari?

2205
02:46:08,160 --> 02:46:10,520
That's just stupid.

2206
02:46:10,520 --> 02:46:16,120
I know. Don't watch that show. Just don't watch it and then he won't get to give reviews.

2207
02:46:16,120 --> 02:46:20,120
Listen to our show and tell people that we should be on TV.

2208
02:46:20,120 --> 02:46:24,120
Vote us for president and give us money.

2209
02:46:24,120 --> 02:46:28,620
Listen to Zaku who says, F you to death for taking Captain Jack from this earth on Friday.

2210
02:46:28,620 --> 02:46:32,720
F you to still being single. F you to this nagging stuff he knows I've been having these days.

2211
02:46:32,720 --> 02:46:38,160
One that I'm getting flack from one of my professors since she's saying I'm trying to get her sick.

2212
02:46:38,160 --> 02:46:42,680
Sephiroth1215 says, F you to Funimation for butchering Dragon Ball Z, still,

2213
02:46:42,680 --> 02:46:53,640
because even if I play Budokai Tenkashi, it still says H-I-F-L instead of Hell and Hercule instead of Mr. Satan.

2214
02:46:53,640 --> 02:47:01,680
The game is rated Teen, you don't need to do that. In fact, you don't even need to do that with an E-rated game.

2215
02:47:01,680 --> 02:47:05,380
Raaz says, F you to old ladies coughing on me for an hour and a half.

2216
02:47:05,380 --> 02:47:09,680
F you to the health teacher who accused me of plagiarism and then denied it like three days later.

2217
02:47:10,680 --> 02:47:13,380
What is it about science teachers and assholes, them being assholes?

2218
02:47:13,380 --> 02:47:14,880
In church, in general.

2219
02:47:14,880 --> 02:47:15,380
I'm kidding.

2220
02:47:15,380 --> 02:47:20,180
Ronchan says, to go along with Loki, a massive F you to people who take clothes out of the laundry machines.

2221
02:47:20,180 --> 02:47:22,080
No one told you to touch my clothes, okay?

2222
02:47:22,080 --> 02:47:24,780
You can wait five fucking minutes till I walk back into the laundromat.

2223
02:47:24,780 --> 02:47:28,780
And on behalf of the chat room, F you to Sakurina for talking smack about Captain Jack.

2224
02:47:31,780 --> 02:47:35,780
Lego Freak says F you to every girl, why don't they like me?

2225
02:47:37,780 --> 02:47:44,780
And then lastly, Dirty Thief says F you to my friend who hit me in the crotch with a shoe twice in one day.

2226
02:47:48,780 --> 02:47:50,780
That sounds pretty hot.

2227
02:47:50,780 --> 02:48:04,780
You know, though, that is a segment in, you know, that America's Funniest Home Videos that's so way overdone, that they always have those videos of people getting hit in the crotch, and, like, they're not funny.

2228
02:48:04,780 --> 02:48:10,780
They're not funny. They're, like, they're totally, like, insanely not funny. Insanely not.

2229
02:48:10,780 --> 02:48:18,780
You know what I saw on a sale for a DVD is, like, frickin' America's Funniest Home Videos, like, an entire season on DVD, and I was like, why would you buy this? Why?

2230
02:48:18,780 --> 02:48:24,660
I know they show it on PAX TV or like all those other channels TNT. Is it on ABC?

2231
02:48:24,660 --> 02:48:28,580
I think they still still hosted by Tom Bergeron now or whatever

2232
02:48:28,580 --> 02:48:32,620
Yeah, the guy that was on Hollywood Squares better than Bob Sagar Hollywood Squares still on I

2233
02:48:33,340 --> 02:48:40,280
Don't think so. Well, that's too bad. Whoopi Goldberg was a cool Center Square. It's thought I'd share really like her not really

2234
02:48:40,280 --> 02:48:50,880
Anyway, what we're going to do now, I think we'll go to a quick break, and then when we

2235
02:48:50,880 --> 02:48:54,320
come back, maybe Ask Orange Lounge for a little bit?

2236
02:48:54,320 --> 02:48:55,320
Ask Extifer?

2237
02:48:55,320 --> 02:48:56,320
Ask me anything.

2238
02:48:56,320 --> 02:48:57,320
All right, anything.

2239
02:48:57,320 --> 02:49:01,000
All right, ask us anything, and we'll be back after this.

2240
02:49:01,000 --> 02:49:05,040
We're going to do a really quick, quick break here to give you guys a chance to send us

2241
02:49:05,040 --> 02:49:07,760
in some questions for Ask Orange Lounge.

2242
02:49:07,760 --> 02:49:11,480
have been begging for this song all night so I definitely have to indulge

2243
02:49:11,480 --> 02:49:15,960
our chat room with this because I live for our chat room. We'll be back after

2244
02:49:15,960 --> 02:49:22,960
with more Orange Lounge Radio and Ask Orange Lounge. Get your questions in now.

2245
02:49:45,960 --> 02:50:03,960
Oh, one more time, I'm back with a new rhyme Hey, here we go again, turn it up my friend

2246
02:50:03,960 --> 02:50:09,960
No, we don't stop talking, we rock the spot No, we don't quit, get failure, this is it

2247
02:50:09,960 --> 02:50:11,960
Do you like to say maybe do you like to scream?

2248
02:50:11,960 --> 02:50:13,960
Hey I like to dream, baby

2249
02:50:13,960 --> 02:50:15,960
Do you like to dream oh

2250
02:50:15,960 --> 02:50:17,960
I like to dream mama do you like to scream?

2251
02:50:17,960 --> 02:50:19,960
Hey I like to scream baby

2252
02:50:19,960 --> 02:50:21,960
Do you like to scream

2253
02:50:21,960 --> 02:50:23,960
Oh so scream it out

2254
02:50:23,960 --> 02:50:25,960
Scream out, scream out

2255
02:50:25,960 --> 02:50:49,960
And just so you guys know, the only thing better than dream a dream is more dream a

2256
02:50:49,960 --> 02:50:56,960
a dream.

2257
02:51:19,960 --> 02:51:24,960
I'm back with a new rhyme, hey! Here we go again, turn it up my friends, go!

2258
02:51:24,960 --> 02:51:29,960
We don't stop, we rock the spot, go! We don't quit, you feel your innocence

2259
02:51:29,960 --> 02:51:33,960
Do you like to dream? Hey! I like to dream, baby

2260
02:51:33,960 --> 02:51:36,960
Do you like to dream? Whoa! I like to dream, mommy

2261
02:51:36,960 --> 02:51:39,960
Do you like to scream? Hey! I like to scream, baby

2262
02:51:39,960 --> 02:51:42,960
Do you like to scream? Oh! So scream it out

2263
02:51:42,960 --> 02:51:45,960
Scream out, dream up, a tip it in your ear

2264
02:52:15,960 --> 02:52:21,960
You gotta, you gotta, you gotta, you gotta, you gotta, you gotta, you gotta, you gotta dream a little dream.

2265
02:52:21,960 --> 02:52:23,960
Orange Lounge Radio,

2266
02:52:23,960 --> 02:52:25,960
Bahmani Music,

2267
02:52:25,960 --> 02:52:27,960
and more.

2268
02:52:27,960 --> 02:52:29,960
Perfect!

2269
02:52:33,960 --> 02:52:35,960
Let's ask Orange Lounge,

2270
02:52:35,960 --> 02:52:37,960
some stupid question,

2271
02:52:37,960 --> 02:52:40,960
what will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?

2272
02:52:40,960 --> 02:52:42,960
I'm curious to see if

2273
02:52:42,960 --> 02:52:47,600
actually got any questions but it would be nice to he would stop talking about

2274
02:52:47,600 --> 02:52:54,880
Madonna for once that was a laughing riot there sure everybody just dropped

2275
02:52:54,880 --> 02:53:03,880
everything they did floating laughter uh Renee wants to know what will it take to

2276
02:53:03,880 --> 02:53:09,160
get MIDI head on the show and sky mr. Maury Povich would like to know are you

2277
02:53:09,160 --> 02:53:12,920
the father

2278
02:53:12,920 --> 02:53:16,160
the last time i had sex with a woman

2279
02:53:16,160 --> 02:53:18,160
nevermind

2280
02:53:18,160 --> 02:53:19,600
it was a kid

2281
02:53:19,600 --> 02:53:22,600
what what would it take to get many head on the show probably if we just ask

2282
02:53:22,600 --> 02:53:25,720
really nicely and we do want to get him on the show sometime around the release

2283
02:53:25,720 --> 02:53:27,280
time of ultra mix three so

2284
02:53:27,280 --> 02:53:30,880
i look forward to it i'm sure he'll do it now we just have to ask really nicely

2285
02:53:30,880 --> 02:53:31,840
so we will

2286
02:53:31,840 --> 02:53:34,720
we'll have our people talk to his people what you guys know

2287
02:53:34,720 --> 02:53:37,380
uh... we also want to know

2288
02:53:37,380 --> 02:53:42,380
Is that promo with something-something making Captain Jack cry getting retired?

2289
02:53:42,380 --> 02:53:45,480
Um, we don't know yet. We think so.

2290
02:53:45,480 --> 02:53:49,120
But we definitely don't want to retire Copy Kill's music, because that thing's awesome.

2291
02:53:49,120 --> 02:53:54,040
Um, but as far as the promo, you know what, all of our old promos really need to be retired,

2292
02:53:54,040 --> 02:53:55,740
but we're just too lazy to make new ones.

2293
02:53:55,740 --> 02:53:59,800
Maybe we should have a promo-making contest. Maybe that's how we could get rid of this, uh,

2294
02:53:59,800 --> 02:54:02,100
DDR Extreme 2. I wonder if people would do it.

2295
02:54:02,100 --> 02:54:07,800
I didn't know, Charum, would you guys make us promos if we gave away an Extreme 2 bundle?

2296
02:54:07,800 --> 02:54:10,600
An official Konami soft pad?

2297
02:54:10,600 --> 02:54:13,200
That might be cool.

2298
02:54:13,200 --> 02:54:19,200
Let's get to some more questions.

2299
02:54:19,200 --> 02:54:24,820
Sakurina wants to know, is 69 easier with a hard-on?

2300
02:54:24,820 --> 02:54:26,340
Of course it is.

2301
02:54:26,340 --> 02:54:29,380
I think that's... If you don't have one,

2302
02:54:29,380 --> 02:54:34,260
Why are you doing the 69? Right, I mean, you don't necessarily fall asleep when you're

2303
02:54:34,260 --> 02:54:38,100
doing the 69. Well, if you're a girl, though, you wouldn't have a hard-on, and then 69 would

2304
02:54:38,100 --> 02:54:42,460
be just fine. That's true, that's true. Yeah, you wouldn't do that to a vagina. I mean,

2305
02:54:42,460 --> 02:54:50,540
vaginas don't get hard, so, no. But I appreciate the question, and yes, my advice would be

2306
02:54:50,540 --> 02:54:56,980
that you have a hard-on when you do a 69. Legend of Zaku is wondering aloud in a question,

2307
02:54:56,980 --> 02:55:01,360
Are they going to bury Captain Jack in his trademark uniform?

2308
02:55:01,360 --> 02:55:07,460
You always know there's got to be somebody thinking I'm morbid.

2309
02:55:07,460 --> 02:55:09,920
If I were Captain Jack, I would want to be buried in the uniform.

2310
02:55:09,920 --> 02:55:11,940
I think they have to.

2311
02:55:11,940 --> 02:55:14,380
Where was he not in that uniform, honestly?

2312
02:55:14,380 --> 02:55:18,580
I think they should.

2313
02:55:18,580 --> 02:55:22,500
I love how everybody gets so mad when people ask me questions.

2314
02:55:22,500 --> 02:55:25,980
Like I'm going to take offense or something.

2315
02:55:25,980 --> 02:55:30,980
NintendoManiac64 wants to know, why am I eating Cheddar Chex Mix instead of Ranch Doritos?

2316
02:55:30,980 --> 02:55:32,980
Because it's less fattening? I don't know.

2317
02:55:32,980 --> 02:55:36,980
Why are none of the awesome Mario Kart 64 tracks a Mario Kart DS?

2318
02:55:36,980 --> 02:55:41,980
Because Nintendo will release Mario Kart DS Extreme or something that has the extra tracks in it later.

2319
02:55:41,980 --> 02:55:44,980
Has Mario Kart DS even come out yet? No.

2320
02:55:44,980 --> 02:55:50,980
How do you know they're not unlockables?

2321
02:55:50,980 --> 02:55:55,140
So, Loki, what did you exactly do with my foot last night?

2322
02:55:55,140 --> 02:55:57,340
Everyone in chat wants to hear your sick, perverted, gay thoughts.

2323
02:55:57,340 --> 02:55:58,980
I have no idea what he's saying.

2324
02:55:58,980 --> 02:56:01,460
That was like an hour ago on the show, I don't even remember.

2325
02:56:01,460 --> 02:56:03,340
I wasn't even paying attention then.

2326
02:56:03,340 --> 02:56:04,340
Oh well.

2327
02:56:04,340 --> 02:56:08,780
Will any of you guys or chat room folks go to, beep, somebody's trying to hoard their

2328
02:56:08,780 --> 02:56:10,780
website once it's complete.

2329
02:56:10,780 --> 02:56:13,860
Yes, complete it, and then we'll say the website.

2330
02:56:13,860 --> 02:56:15,460
I haven't even visited yet.

2331
02:56:15,460 --> 02:56:16,460
I'll visit it.

2332
02:56:16,460 --> 02:56:20,460
Send me an email, ask me really nicely, I'll visit it and give you my opinion.

2333
02:56:21,460 --> 02:56:24,540
illusion wants to know now what's it all about Alfie

2334
02:56:25,780 --> 02:56:29,100
Seeing a good movie for a change would be my answer a movie you

2335
02:56:30,820 --> 02:56:32,900
Yeah, Alfie sucked

2336
02:56:35,580 --> 02:56:37,580
It's lame that's all you need to know

2337
02:56:38,700 --> 02:56:42,940
Lego freak wants to know hey, buddy. Can I have a hundred dollars wink wink a nudge nudge?

2338
02:56:42,940 --> 02:57:06,140
One day when we're rich and famous, we'll give away cash and fabulous prizes on the

2339
02:57:06,140 --> 02:57:09,380
show, and we'll remember your support.

2340
02:57:09,380 --> 02:57:13,580
Kago wants to know, after no field trips the past three years, I have two coming up in

2341
02:57:13,580 --> 02:57:19,060
the next two weeks. Should I go on both and risk missing work, or only go on one and get

2342
02:57:19,060 --> 02:57:21,740
all my work done? It kind of depends where you're going.

2343
02:57:21,740 --> 02:57:25,580
Yeah, are you going to the pumpkin patch? Yeah, if you're going to the pumpkin patch,

2344
02:57:25,580 --> 02:57:28,020
fuck that shit, you don't need to go to the pumpkin patch.

2345
02:57:28,020 --> 02:57:34,020
But if you're going to like, I don't know, Hooters, then go.

2346
02:57:34,020 --> 02:57:42,980
I mean, if it's to Canada, I would go to Canada at a field trip.

2347
02:57:42,980 --> 02:57:43,980
Let's see.

2348
02:57:43,980 --> 02:57:57,620
Duran wants to know, I need an NES, can I have yours?

2349
02:57:57,620 --> 02:57:58,980
My NES is broken.

2350
02:57:58,980 --> 02:58:04,480
I mean, it won't even play the cartridges after I, like, blow on them like there's no tomorrow.

2351
02:58:04,480 --> 02:58:05,480
Extra shut up.

2352
02:58:06,480 --> 02:58:11,980
My NES just don't work no more, so if you want a broken paperweight, I guess you could have that.

2353
02:58:13,980 --> 02:58:16,480
No one ever asks me any questions.

2354
02:58:17,480 --> 02:58:19,480
Well, you want to give your NES to Duran?

2355
02:58:20,480 --> 02:58:25,480
No, I actually have the one that top loads, if you remember that.

2356
02:58:25,480 --> 02:58:26,480
Oh, lucky you.

2357
02:58:26,480 --> 02:58:29,480
And I have the original as well, so...

2358
02:58:30,480 --> 02:58:32,480
Yes, they work, and no, you can't have them.

2359
02:58:33,480 --> 02:58:36,480
Otherwise, I can't play Guardian Legends, so there.

2360
02:58:38,480 --> 02:58:41,480
Goggle wanted to clarify the two field trips.

2361
02:58:41,480 --> 02:58:44,480
It's a museum on one day and a play on the other.

2362
02:58:44,480 --> 02:58:46,480
Okay, I would go to the play.

2363
02:58:46,480 --> 02:58:48,480
Well, I think both are worth it, and here's why.

2364
02:58:48,480 --> 02:58:51,480
The museum, you're going to see nudity at the museum,

2365
02:58:51,480 --> 02:58:53,480
because, like, you know, in classic arts, there's going to be nudity,

2366
02:58:53,480 --> 02:58:56,560
be nudity and like in sculptures and stuff usually there's naked one or two

2367
02:58:56,560 --> 02:59:00,840
like a butt. Autistic nudity is not that great. Yeah but it's nudity and then you

2368
02:59:00,840 --> 02:59:03,760
should see the play because there's a chance of nudity depending on what the

2369
02:59:03,760 --> 02:59:07,960
play is like if it's a little g-rated musical like The Lion King forget it but

2370
02:59:07,960 --> 02:59:11,680
you know if it's something else like you know. You don't even have nudity I mean

2371
02:59:11,680 --> 02:59:16,560
they if if they're wearing tights you're gonna see their package yeah so I mean

2372
02:59:16,560 --> 02:59:21,320
you know if you see if you see penal structure behind that you know tight that

2373
02:59:21,320 --> 02:59:26,320
Goggle, go where the nudity is. That's my advice, my sound advice to you.

2374
02:59:26,320 --> 02:59:33,320
Alright, that's it. We're done. We're done with this show.

2375
02:59:33,320 --> 02:59:35,320
Put the nail in the coffin of the show. We're done.

2376
02:59:35,320 --> 02:59:38,320
I was pretty PG-13 tonight, wouldn't you say so, Rob Robert?

2377
02:59:38,320 --> 02:59:42,320
You did a fairly good job, Extrofer Extroferson.

2378
02:59:42,320 --> 02:59:45,320
Alright.

2379
02:59:45,320 --> 02:59:49,320
I don't know what else to call you. You don't have a stage last name yet. You need one.

2380
02:59:49,320 --> 02:59:51,600
it's going to be extra for

2381
02:59:51,600 --> 02:59:53,760
and and it's going to be on

2382
02:59:53,760 --> 02:59:56,100
uh... the show tomorrow

2383
02:59:56,100 --> 02:59:57,960
rob pitch michelle

2384
02:59:57,960 --> 03:00:01,940
uh... listen to the rob robert show on wednesday it'll be a good time

2385
03:00:01,940 --> 03:00:08,940
pitch of the real show so i forgot to talk about

2386
03:00:08,940 --> 03:00:10,600
final thoughts

2387
03:00:10,600 --> 03:00:15,140
angel your final thought

2388
03:00:15,140 --> 03:00:17,540
I want to go home and play World of Warcraft.

2389
03:00:17,540 --> 03:00:19,380
Oh!

2390
03:00:19,380 --> 03:00:22,820
Extrovert, your final thought. Oh, I'm sorry.

2391
03:00:22,820 --> 03:00:27,500
Oh, Addict? Well, that's reserved for Final Fantasy XI. I'll think of another word for World of Warcraft.

2392
03:00:27,500 --> 03:00:30,620
Extrovert, your final thought.

2393
03:00:30,620 --> 03:00:34,580
I want to go home and play World of Warcraft.

2394
03:00:34,580 --> 03:00:40,460
Oh! But you're already home!

2395
03:00:40,460 --> 03:00:44,920
He's going to come over to your house, and that will be like the worst thing ever.

2396
03:00:44,920 --> 03:00:45,920
LOKI!

2397
03:00:45,920 --> 03:00:46,920
Um...

2398
03:00:46,920 --> 03:00:55,920
I hope this works and...

2399
03:00:55,920 --> 03:00:56,920
It doesn't work.

2400
03:00:56,920 --> 03:00:57,920
No, it doesn't.

2401
03:00:57,920 --> 03:00:58,920
Okay.

2402
03:00:58,920 --> 03:00:59,920
Son of a bitch.

2403
03:00:59,920 --> 03:01:02,480
By the way, I'd just like to point out that we've actually been short two hosts tonight

2404
03:01:02,480 --> 03:01:06,000
because Dark Sakura isn't here and Loki has just really not been involved in the show.

2405
03:01:06,000 --> 03:01:09,040
He's been working on something for the site the whole night so he could care less about

2406
03:01:09,040 --> 03:01:10,040
this show.

2407
03:01:10,040 --> 03:01:12,500
I'm participating.

2408
03:01:12,500 --> 03:01:18,280
low-key does not care about orange lounge people

2409
03:01:18,280 --> 03:01:22,620
i got them hate p h p

2410
03:01:22,620 --> 03:01:25,860
my final thought is i want to top loading any s now

2411
03:01:25,860 --> 03:01:31,340
jealous i can bring mine over and you can play games to get to the chris

2412
03:01:31,340 --> 03:01:34,920
uh... may or if it if you don't have to have a war and i just might

2413
03:01:34,920 --> 03:01:36,500
okay

2414
03:01:36,500 --> 03:01:41,280
why why is that game so so wonderful because it's kitty chris but if i mean

2415
03:01:41,280 --> 03:01:44,240
And it was the fucking hardest game that I played when I played it.

2416
03:01:44,240 --> 03:01:46,480
I beat it because I'm the shit.

2417
03:01:46,480 --> 03:01:48,640
You are the shit.

2418
03:01:48,640 --> 03:01:50,360
Keep going with that, Rob.

2419
03:01:50,360 --> 03:01:54,760
But meanwhile, I still think that it was kind of difficult.

2420
03:01:54,760 --> 03:01:58,120
Maybe it was just because I'm not video game prone or something.

2421
03:01:58,120 --> 03:01:59,280
Maybe that's it.

2422
03:01:59,280 --> 03:02:00,840
I beat Legend of Zelda.

2423
03:02:00,840 --> 03:02:01,840
Good job.

2424
03:02:01,840 --> 03:02:02,840
Oh, no problem.

2425
03:02:02,840 --> 03:02:04,800
Did you beat the second quest, though?

2426
03:02:04,800 --> 03:02:05,800
I did.

2427
03:02:05,800 --> 03:02:06,800
I did beat it.

2428
03:02:06,800 --> 03:02:07,800
Good job.

2429
03:02:07,800 --> 03:02:08,800
Did you beat Zelda 2?

2430
03:02:08,800 --> 03:02:10,200
I didn't.

2431
03:02:10,200 --> 03:02:11,200
You suck!

2432
03:02:11,200 --> 03:02:13,860
I know.

2433
03:02:13,860 --> 03:02:16,700
Final word of the show, one word to sum it all up.

2434
03:02:16,700 --> 03:02:17,700
Rob Roberts?

2435
03:02:17,700 --> 03:02:18,700
No.

2436
03:02:18,700 --> 03:02:19,700
Oh, do I get to get the final word?

2437
03:02:19,700 --> 03:02:22,140
I believe you do, because you never do.

2438
03:02:22,140 --> 03:02:23,540
I never do do the final word of the show.

2439
03:02:23,540 --> 03:02:24,900
God dammit, do the final word of the show.

2440
03:02:24,900 --> 03:02:28,540
Alright, here's the final word of tonight's show.

2441
03:02:28,540 --> 03:02:33,320
Go left, go right, go pick up a step, go left, go right, go left.

2442
03:02:33,320 --> 03:02:39,020
That does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live.

2443
03:02:39,020 --> 03:02:43,060

Together forever, we are all for one Together forever, come and set me free

Together forever We're all for one

2454
03:04:16,900 --> 03:04:21,900
For once, together, forever, come and set me free

2455
03:04:21,900 --> 03:04:24,900
Set me free tonight

2456
03:04:24,900 --> 03:04:28,900
Take the way to paradise

2457
03:04:28,900 --> 03:04:33,900
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.

2458
03:04:33,900 --> 03:04:59,620
Are you sad that DarkSakur wasn't here tonight?

2459
03:04:59,620 --> 03:05:01,620
What do you have to say to our listeners?

2460
03:05:01,620 --> 03:05:03,620
Are you going to tune in next week?

2461
03:05:05,620 --> 03:05:07,620
Are you going to download our podcast?

2462
03:05:10,620 --> 03:05:12,620
Are you going to say goodnight to the listeners?

2463
03:05:13,620 --> 03:05:18,620
All right, tell them that they have to reconnect to the stream in 15 seconds after they get dumped

2464
03:05:18,620 --> 03:05:22,820
get dumped so they can tune into our Bahmanian video game music program. Can you say all

2465
03:05:22,820 --> 03:05:23,820
What?

2466
03:05:23,820 --> 03:05:25,820
Oh
