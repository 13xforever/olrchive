05:37.144 --> 05:38.244
[SPEAKER_07]: It tastes like burning.

05:39.245 --> 05:40.505
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it tasted like burrito.

05:40.525 --> 05:41.085
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what's funny?

05:41.125 --> 05:45.446
[SPEAKER_07]: I think your mic faded out right at the point where you burped, so it didn't pick it up even, which is great.

05:45.866 --> 05:46.467
Burp!

05:46.667 --> 05:47.207

[SPEAKER_07]: Good.

05:54.272 --> 05:56.994
[SPEAKER_07]: You seem a little withdrawn tonight, giving me one-word answers.

05:57.894 --> 06:00.356
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, I just haven't gotten into the show yet.

06:00.416 --> 06:02.218
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you committed to this program?

06:02.678 --> 06:02.938
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

06:04.139 --> 06:04.660

06:04.900 --> 06:05.220
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

06:06.021 --> 06:11.585
[SPEAKER_07]: Also with us tonight, say hello to the crazy, the delusional, but the very funny, Extifer.

06:12.846 --> 06:13.367
[SPEAKER_07]: Yo, yo.

06:14.127 --> 06:14.908
[SPEAKER_07]: How you doing, Extifer?

06:15.448 --> 06:18.130
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm doing great with a side of good.

06:20.312 --> 06:21.153

06:22.283 --> 06:25.365
[SPEAKER_07]: Also with us tonight, say hello to Miss DDR Angel.

06:25.565 --> 06:25.805
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello.

06:25.865 --> 06:26.585
[SPEAKER_07]: How you doing?

06:26.966 --> 06:28.506
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm good.

06:29.507 --> 06:33.729
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I've got a lot of stuff to talk about, but I guess we can talk about that later.

06:33.749 --> 06:34.069
[SPEAKER_10]: Good!

06:34.109 --> 06:38.271
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I have news about said convention from this weekend.

06:38.311 --> 06:39.372
[SPEAKER_10]: Hint, elbow, hint.

06:39.432 --> 06:40.432
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you go to BlizzCon?

06:40.612 --> 06:41.053
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I didn't.

06:41.213 --> 06:41.333
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh.

06:41.393 --> 06:42.733
[SPEAKER_10]: I know a lot of news about it.

06:42.753 --> 06:43.994
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, the fuck?

06:44.034 --> 06:46.155
[SPEAKER_07]: We had representation at BlizzCon?

06:46.976 --> 06:47.016
[SPEAKER_10]: Um...

06:47.896 --> 06:48.376
[SPEAKER_10]: Sort of.

06:48.756 --> 06:54.139
[SPEAKER_10]: I kind of had my ins as far as finding out about stuff even though I wasn't there.

06:54.419 --> 06:55.239
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, does that make sense?

06:55.480 --> 06:57.240
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I gotcha.

06:58.241 --> 07:02.383
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll talk about my relationship with Blizzard Entertainment in a little while.

07:03.243 --> 07:04.404
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll talk about that when we come back.

07:04.424 --> 07:05.024
[SPEAKER_07]: How's that sound?

07:05.124 --> 07:05.644
[SPEAKER_10]: No, that's fine.

07:05.684 --> 07:15.309
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanted to, like, you know... No, I love Blizzard now, which is ironic because I used to think they were so overrated, but ever since I started playing World of Warcraft and can't fucking stop...

07:15.989 --> 07:19.371
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm suddenly like, ooh, I want to go to BlizzCon!

07:19.411 --> 07:24.112
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no, I will not tell you what I ran last, er, like, 15 minutes ago.

07:24.453 --> 07:24.693
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

07:25.213 --> 07:26.713
[SPEAKER_10]: Zofarok, you don't want to run that.

07:27.054 --> 07:27.334
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

07:27.354 --> 07:33.816
[SPEAKER_10]: It's called Zofarok, it's like, yeah, like this really big instance thing, and it hurts in the end.

07:34.056 --> 07:35.897
[SPEAKER_07]: Isn't that that new movie, like Jumanji?

07:38.898 --> 07:40.979
[SPEAKER_07]: Or is that the medication you take when you're depressed?

07:41.119 --> 07:42.740
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a lot, I don't know.

07:43.460 --> 07:44.181
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura

08:07.926 --> 08:12.709
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't even know if what she's got on the screen is related to the show.

08:12.769 --> 08:15.811
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm looking at Playgirl models.

08:17.873 --> 08:19.113
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go to a break, kids.

08:19.173 --> 08:22.095
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll be back after this with more... I'm looking at naked Daryl Hannah.

08:23.636 --> 08:23.996
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, sorry.

08:24.157 --> 08:26.718
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm actually going to be ordering Clint at the cave fair.

08:27.639 --> 08:28.439
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys are so weird.

08:28.459 --> 08:29.460
[SPEAKER_10]: And Iguana Girl says hi.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.281
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, right on.

08:31.982 --> 08:33.903
[SPEAKER_08]: Is her people hair gray and wiry?

08:35.066 --> 08:35.346
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

08:35.927 --> 08:36.727
[SPEAKER_08]: Daryl Hannah.

08:37.268 --> 08:37.828
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

08:38.469 --> 08:39.930
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I thought you were talking about Iguana Girl.

08:39.970 --> 08:40.531
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, what?

08:40.671 --> 08:41.511
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, no, no, no, no.

08:41.671 --> 08:43.053
[SPEAKER_08]: I was talking about Daryl Hannah.

08:44.234 --> 08:47.296
[SPEAKER_08]: But is Iguana Girls... No, I'm kidding.

08:48.517 --> 08:49.658
[SPEAKER_07]: On that note, let's go to a break.

08:52.153 --> 08:53.174
[SPEAKER_07]: And we'll be back after this.

08:53.234 --> 09:01.704
[SPEAKER_07]: And we might actually talk about some music game stuff, because apparently Ultramix 3, the song list released, and there's a concert coming to town, and all this other garbage I want to talk about too.

09:01.964 --> 09:02.765
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll be back after this.

09:03.005 --> 09:04.667
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, join our chat room, won't you?

09:04.807 --> 09:06.529
[SPEAKER_07]: OrangeLoungeRadio.com, click on chat.

09:06.990 --> 09:11.014
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll start it off this break with a little bit of Taku from 2DX4Style.

09:11.154 --> 09:11.555
[SPEAKER_07]: Enjoy.

10:14.222 --> 10:15.187
Thank you for watching!

15:26.724 --> 15:31.025
Gaming Radio, so uncensored that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.

15:31.125 --> 15:31.945
Orange Lounge Radio.

15:55.117 --> 15:57.321
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, we're here.

15:57.401 --> 15:58.402
[SPEAKER_10]: I like burritos, Rob.

15:59.175 --> 15:59.595
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you?

15:59.775 --> 16:00.256
[SPEAKER_08]: That's good to hear.

16:00.376 --> 16:01.396
[SPEAKER_08]: It sounds like it.

16:01.596 --> 16:02.597
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, literally.

16:02.837 --> 16:03.897
[SPEAKER_10]: It smells like it, too.

16:04.578 --> 16:05.298
[SPEAKER_07]: We all know.

16:05.798 --> 16:07.379
[SPEAKER_07]: That mic's getting retired before the end of the night.

16:07.399 --> 16:08.500
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what's going on with it.

16:08.540 --> 16:10.821
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, this microphone sucks a big chunk of ass.

16:10.941 --> 16:11.881
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's what it is.

16:11.901 --> 16:13.362
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you want me to pick up a new mic?

16:14.022 --> 16:14.623
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you going to Target?

16:14.643 --> 16:15.643
[SPEAKER_08]: And you can reimburse me?

16:16.243 --> 16:16.604
[SPEAKER_07]: F yes.

16:16.664 --> 16:18.084
[SPEAKER_08]: Go to Target and get a new mic.

16:19.285 --> 16:20.505
[SPEAKER_08]: That's awesome.

16:21.486 --> 16:22.667
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm so awesome, aren't I?

16:22.927 --> 16:23.707
[SPEAKER_07]: You're okay.

16:24.467 --> 16:24.567
[SPEAKER_08]: Aww.

16:26.297 --> 16:27.759
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, so we'll get that fixed.

16:27.779 --> 16:29.561
[SPEAKER_07]: Good, that means I'll be fixed before the podcast.

16:29.581 --> 16:30.182
[SPEAKER_07]: That makes me happy.

16:31.524 --> 16:31.965
[SPEAKER_07]: So anyway.

16:33.426 --> 16:34.348
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow, that kind of threw me.

16:35.149 --> 16:39.555
[SPEAKER_07]: I just think it would be really funny if one day we were at a break and then we just didn't come back.

16:40.956 --> 16:42.999
[SPEAKER_07]: You just kind of hear the music in the background and we're not there.

16:43.905 --> 16:45.226
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, maybe we already pulled that rank.

16:45.246 --> 16:45.546
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

16:46.146 --> 16:48.327
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, hi, you're listening to Orange Sounds Radio.

16:48.347 --> 16:48.727
[SPEAKER_07]: We are here.

16:48.747 --> 16:49.247
[SPEAKER_07]: We are live.

16:49.348 --> 16:55.770
[SPEAKER_07]: I noticed, just judging from the names I see in chat room, we have quite a few people tonight who haven't listened before.

16:56.291 --> 17:03.634
[SPEAKER_07]: And judging from what's been going on in general in the past 10 months, we have more and more people listening to us thanks to our podcast, which I think, you know, that's awesome.

17:03.694 --> 17:05.115
[SPEAKER_07]: That was the whole idea.

17:05.155 --> 17:11.878
[SPEAKER_07]: We did a podcast in the first place because we were like, oh, maybe we'll get like two or three people listening to the podcast that will come over and then listen to our live show.

17:12.378 --> 17:16.581
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the fucking podcast gets like 40 times the listeners our live show gets.

17:16.641 --> 17:17.301
[SPEAKER_07]: It's crazy.

17:17.741 --> 17:18.542
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's cool.

17:18.562 --> 17:18.922
[SPEAKER_07]: We love it.

17:18.962 --> 17:22.784
[SPEAKER_07]: We love the fact that people are listening to it and just loving it.

17:23.165 --> 17:24.946
[SPEAKER_07]: But I do got to warn people.

17:25.899 --> 17:26.580
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

17:50.922 --> 17:52.683
[SPEAKER_07]: What's happened to the DDR Freak boards?

17:52.783 --> 17:53.303
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like this.

17:53.383 --> 17:59.126
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, we're dedicated, this show is dedicated to music games like MTV is dedicated to music.

17:59.206 --> 18:00.847
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, that's a great analogy.

18:02.868 --> 18:04.309
[SPEAKER_07]: We are the MTV of music gaming.

18:04.529 --> 18:07.470
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't really say anything too bad about the DDR Freak boards, though.

18:07.550 --> 18:09.011
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm not saying a negative thing at all.

18:09.031 --> 18:12.293
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no, no, not just because I moderate there, but because I've seen worse.

18:13.061 --> 18:13.341
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.

18:13.581 --> 18:13.801
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no.

18:14.182 --> 18:14.902
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not saying anything.

18:14.922 --> 18:18.403
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, if I wanted to say something negative about the DDR Freak Boards, I'd go to a different topic.

18:18.483 --> 18:29.809
[SPEAKER_07]: But the DDR Freak Boards in general, if you notice where the majority of posts are, well, maybe not the majority, but the real active users and the long-time users all kind of flock to one forum.

18:30.649 --> 18:31.409
[SPEAKER_07]: Random chat.

18:32.870 --> 18:35.171
[SPEAKER_07]: So we are the random chat of the Internet.

18:35.251 --> 18:35.611
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

18:36.612 --> 18:38.833
[SPEAKER_10]: Random chat lately is the bane of my existence.

18:41.514 --> 18:41.794
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

18:44.195 --> 18:45.435
[SPEAKER_07]: That is a great analogy.

18:45.495 --> 18:46.415
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, that was great.

18:46.435 --> 18:48.556
[SPEAKER_07]: We're like MTV is to music.

18:49.996 --> 18:52.277
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, oh, even the chat room agrees.

18:52.617 --> 18:54.717
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki wins the show, says MPQ.

18:54.797 --> 18:55.157
[SPEAKER_07]: Good job.

18:55.517 --> 18:56.778
[SPEAKER_07]: G4 is going the same way.

18:57.558 --> 18:59.138
[SPEAKER_07]: G4 has nothing to do with Games Day.

18:59.158 --> 19:04.079
[SPEAKER_07]: G4 is young man television, and it's a stretch of that.

19:04.199 --> 19:05.640
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm confused by G4.

19:06.060 --> 19:06.780
[SPEAKER_04]: They confuse me.

19:07.200 --> 19:09.040
[SPEAKER_04]: First off, why are they playing Fastlane?

19:09.060 --> 19:12.201
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that show shouldn't be on air at any station.

19:12.563 --> 19:12.843
[SPEAKER_07]: DJ Ranma S

19:32.813 --> 19:36.954
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, just because there was a lesbian couple in Wonderfalls, they put on the whole show.

19:37.534 --> 19:38.995
[SPEAKER_08]: Logo, by the way, being the gay and lesbian.

19:39.015 --> 19:39.655
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, gay and lesbian.

19:39.715 --> 19:40.175
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.

19:40.535 --> 19:47.037
[SPEAKER_08]: For all of you people that don't like to be fucked up the ass, Logo is for gay people.

19:47.137 --> 19:49.157
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

19:49.637 --> 19:51.017
[SPEAKER_08]: My mother watches Logo.

19:51.358 --> 19:52.518
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not just for gay people.

19:52.578 --> 19:53.418
[SPEAKER_08]: It's about gay people.

19:53.478 --> 19:55.299
[SPEAKER_10]: Some people don't have cable.

19:56.419 --> 19:58.339
[SPEAKER_10]: Some of us have to live with Core TV.

19:58.939 --> 19:59.900
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like Bravo?

20:02.941 --> 20:03.901
[SPEAKER_10]: Psychic Detectives.

20:04.382 --> 20:07.643
[SPEAKER_07]: No, Bravo is somehow gayer than Logo still.

20:07.883 --> 20:13.825
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, honestly, fucking A. Project Runway is like the equivalent of an all-male gangbang.

20:13.905 --> 20:17.286
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if you've ever watched this show, Project Runway.

20:18.147 --> 20:18.907
[SPEAKER_07]: It's gay.

20:19.327 --> 20:24.409
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's like 10 Madonna videos all back-to-back is what Project Runway is.

20:24.449 --> 20:25.129
[SPEAKER_07]: It is gay.

20:25.750 --> 20:27.270
[SPEAKER_07]: Every guy on that show is gay.

20:27.890 --> 20:29.311
[SPEAKER_07]: It's gay, gay, gay, gay, gay.

20:31.004 --> 20:33.107
[SPEAKER_07]: And see, but since I'm gay, I can say that.

20:33.207 --> 20:37.774
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it's like that episode of South Park where Mr. Garrison goes around and calls everybody a fag because he's gay.

20:37.814 --> 20:40.578
[SPEAKER_07]: That's where I can get away saying that, too.

20:42.901 --> 20:43.122
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

20:45.516 --> 20:50.758
[SPEAKER_07]: Dark Sakura, if your microphone will cooperate with you through this segment, how was your week, how was your day?

21:15.489 --> 21:17.310
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, actually, how was the past two weeks?

21:17.490 --> 21:17.970
[SPEAKER_07]: That's true.

21:19.512 --> 21:20.072
[SPEAKER_10]: Excuse me.

21:20.712 --> 21:23.014
[SPEAKER_10]: I ate a burrito, and burritos make me burp.

21:23.835 --> 21:25.036
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm also drinking Tab.

21:26.597 --> 21:28.218
[SPEAKER_10]: Tab is like the ultimate drink of the year.

21:28.238 --> 21:30.219
[SPEAKER_07]: Why the fuck are you voluntarily drinking Tab?

21:30.980 --> 21:33.762
[SPEAKER_10]: Because the 80s are making a comeback, and not in a good way.

21:36.969 --> 21:43.034
[SPEAKER_07]: If I was on, like, Survivor, and they offered Tab in a reward challenge, I'd be all, fuck you, I'll starve.

21:43.355 --> 21:43.955
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously.

21:44.215 --> 21:45.877
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll drink sand, thank you.

21:46.197 --> 21:51.562
[SPEAKER_07]: I would honestly rather drink ocean water that all the fish have crapped in than Tab.

21:53.583 --> 21:55.985
[SPEAKER_10]: But Tab is tabulous.

21:57.026 --> 21:57.787
[SPEAKER_10]: Fantabulous.

21:58.629 --> 22:00.670
[SPEAKER_07]: You know tab backwards is bat?

22:01.151 --> 22:03.632
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's exactly what it tastes like, blended bat.

22:05.633 --> 22:05.893
[SPEAKER_10]: Rob.

22:06.574 --> 22:06.814
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

22:06.954 --> 22:07.174
[SPEAKER_10]: Dear.

22:07.554 --> 22:07.755
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes?

22:07.835 --> 22:09.135
[SPEAKER_10]: Your analogy sucked ass.

22:09.295 --> 22:09.596
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

22:09.736 --> 22:13.118
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm trying to compete with Loki tonight in the analogy department.

22:17.380 --> 22:20.482
[SPEAKER_10]: I just got an IM that says you're drinking tab?

22:20.502 --> 22:21.002
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes!

22:21.063 --> 22:25.005
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right, you'd get her.

22:25.345 --> 22:28.027
[SPEAKER_04]: That's almost as bad as, what was that, Tang or...

22:29.653 --> 22:33.294
[SPEAKER_10]: The Drink of the Astronauts, Take to the Moon, Astronauts, Moon!

22:33.835 --> 22:39.457
[SPEAKER_07]: Notice how Tab was conspicuously left out of all three I Love the 80s series on VH1?

22:40.337 --> 22:40.817
[SPEAKER_07]: You know why?

22:40.997 --> 22:42.358
[SPEAKER_07]: Because no one loved Tab.

22:42.658 --> 22:43.798
[SPEAKER_07]: No one loved Tab at all.

22:43.818 --> 22:44.439
[SPEAKER_10]: I love Tab.

22:45.259 --> 22:48.020
[SPEAKER_10]: It tastes, like, gross, but I like it.

22:48.160 --> 22:51.741
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what's sad is I woke up this morning... Hey!

22:52.722 --> 22:53.382
[SPEAKER_10]: What about my week?

22:53.971 --> 23:04.498
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we were on the tangent of I Love the 80s, so I was saying, I woke up this morning and I was wondering, how long after it becomes, you know, 2011, will it take VH1 to make the I Love 2000?

23:06.500 --> 23:08.401
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just like... Well, we already have it.

23:08.501 --> 23:09.702
[SPEAKER_07]: It's that show Best Week Ever.

23:09.882 --> 23:13.285
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if you've watched Best Week Ever, but it's basically I Love the Last Week.

23:14.065 --> 23:16.827
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the premise of the show, I Love the Last Week.

23:16.867 --> 23:20.310
[SPEAKER_10]: But you know what drink that we need to have come back besides Crystal Pepsi and Josta?

23:23.562 --> 23:26.925
[SPEAKER_07]: If you say Pepsi Blue, I'm leaving the show.

23:27.165 --> 23:29.147
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I cannot stand Pepsi Blue.

23:29.367 --> 23:30.168
[SPEAKER_07]: Pepsi Blue too.

23:31.108 --> 23:31.949
[SPEAKER_07]: Pepsi Blue.

23:32.209 --> 23:34.031
[SPEAKER_10]: But Tab makes me think of Back to the Future.

23:34.051 --> 23:38.415
[SPEAKER_10]: Where he goes into the bar, another little diner, and says, Give me a Tab.

23:38.875 --> 23:40.156
[SPEAKER_10]: You haven't ordered anything yet.

23:40.176 --> 23:41.017
[SPEAKER_10]: You can't have a Tab.

23:41.497 --> 23:42.618
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, then a Pepsi free.

23:43.139 --> 23:45.501
[SPEAKER_10]: Look, if you're going to have a Pepsi, you have to pay for it.

23:48.724 --> 23:49.004
[SPEAKER_10]: Ha ha.

23:50.443 --> 23:52.984
[SPEAKER_07]: The only thing I can think of that's worse than Tab is Pepsi Blue.

23:53.705 --> 23:54.105
[SPEAKER_10]: Nasty.

23:54.305 --> 23:57.827
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, if that were the reward on Survivor, I'd swish it and spit it at the host.

23:58.047 --> 23:58.787
[SPEAKER_07]: It's that awful.

23:58.827 --> 24:00.228
[SPEAKER_07]: Pepsi Blue is god-awful.

24:01.669 --> 24:02.369
[SPEAKER_10]: Dr. Pepper.

24:02.409 --> 24:03.349
[SPEAKER_10]: Vanilla Dr. Pepper.

24:03.590 --> 24:03.790
[SPEAKER_10]: Ew.

24:04.510 --> 24:07.111
[SPEAKER_10]: The prairie vanilla Dr. Pepper is the nastiest shit ever.

24:07.171 --> 24:07.451
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

24:08.632 --> 24:13.314
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know when we started becoming the soft drink show, but I have to say this.

24:15.726 --> 24:19.211
[SPEAKER_07]: This friend of mine made the best analogy about that diet cherry vanilla, Dr. Pepper.

24:19.751 --> 24:24.298
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't taste like cherry, and it doesn't taste like vanilla, and it really doesn't taste like Dr. Pepper.

24:25.099 --> 24:26.381
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what that's supposed to be.

24:28.484 --> 24:31.047
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like all three of the flavors cancel each other out.

24:31.467 --> 24:33.048
[SPEAKER_07]: And suddenly you've got like Tab.

24:33.269 --> 24:33.609
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

24:34.350 --> 24:36.672
[SPEAKER_10]: Roz just told me that Blue Pepsi tasted like medicine.

24:37.333 --> 24:40.536
[SPEAKER_07]: Blue Pep... I would rather drink a bottle of Dayquil.

24:40.696 --> 24:42.137
[SPEAKER_10]: I said it looked like a toilet bowl.

24:42.337 --> 24:43.479
[SPEAKER_08]: I liked Blue Pepsi.

24:43.739 --> 24:44.660
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my god!

24:44.740 --> 24:45.320
[SPEAKER_08]: Am I weird?

24:45.340 --> 24:46.241
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't kill yourself.

24:46.401 --> 24:48.964
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, my week was eventful.

24:50.025 --> 24:51.727
[SPEAKER_10]: I got to stay on a bus.

24:52.941 --> 24:57.344
[SPEAKER_10]: and go to San Francisco on a bus for my field trip last Sunday.

24:58.524 --> 25:02.827
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just sort of played with my puppies on the way and ignored the teacher.

25:04.388 --> 25:10.011
[SPEAKER_10]: But he was giving us a history of different locations on the way in San Francisco and everything, and it was kind of cool.

25:10.611 --> 25:11.172
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait a minute, wait a minute.

25:11.192 --> 25:12.332
[SPEAKER_10]: But we hardly got out of the bus.

25:12.452 --> 25:13.113
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold up, hold up.

25:14.694 --> 25:17.656
[SPEAKER_07]: The last time I went on a field trip, I was in the 11th grade.

25:19.850 --> 25:21.991
[SPEAKER_07]: I did not know that they did field trips in college.

25:22.231 --> 25:22.411
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

25:22.691 --> 25:22.851
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

25:23.191 --> 25:26.653
[SPEAKER_10]: I've never... They also do camping trips for like single credits and everything.

25:26.753 --> 25:27.413
[SPEAKER_04]: The hell?

25:29.014 --> 25:31.595
[SPEAKER_04]: If you could take bowling as a sport, they have field trips.

25:31.895 --> 25:33.796
[SPEAKER_10]: This is for cultural geography, so we went over...

25:34.329 --> 25:37.951
[SPEAKER_10]: The different settlements and we went by the first mission in San Francisco.

25:38.771 --> 25:42.854
[SPEAKER_10]: And we also went by, this is my favorite place and I've always wanted to get out and go there.

25:42.894 --> 25:44.655
[SPEAKER_10]: It's by the Exploratorium.

25:45.535 --> 25:49.037
[SPEAKER_10]: The Palace of Fine Art that was there since the World's Fair in 1915.

25:49.257 --> 25:52.819
[SPEAKER_10]: The last standing structure from the World's Fair in 1915.

25:53.840 --> 25:58.562
[SPEAKER_10]: And just listening to how most of San Francisco is built on landfill.

25:59.342 --> 26:00.803
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, oh, we have an earthquake.

26:00.843 --> 26:03.485
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's just use all this crap to fill up a lake and build houses on it.

26:04.125 --> 26:05.286
[SPEAKER_10]: Without any real engineering.

26:05.967 --> 26:07.848
[SPEAKER_10]: Really makes me want to live in San Francisco.

26:08.308 --> 26:08.569
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

26:08.849 --> 26:11.151
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you go to the Exploratorium also?

26:11.391 --> 26:11.771
[SPEAKER_10]: No, we didn't.

26:11.791 --> 26:12.151
[SPEAKER_08]: We went.

26:12.191 --> 26:13.092
[SPEAKER_10]: We used their bathroom twice.

26:13.653 --> 26:13.793
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh.

26:15.014 --> 26:16.295
[SPEAKER_08]: I like the Exploratorium.

26:16.315 --> 26:16.675
[SPEAKER_08]: I do too.

26:16.875 --> 26:19.677
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I liked it at the very, very back where nobody really went.

26:19.757 --> 26:28.904
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know, you have that big screen where if you dance in front of it, you can see yourself like a silhouette of yourself on the screen dancing and it changes all sorts of colors.

26:28.924 --> 26:29.565
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I'm talking about?

26:29.585 --> 26:30.706
[SPEAKER_10]: They have a place like that in Mobile.

26:30.766 --> 26:32.007
[SPEAKER_10]: It's actually just called the Explorium.

26:32.407 --> 26:32.667
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, really?

26:32.687 --> 26:35.390
[SPEAKER_10]: It's in downtown Mobile, built out of, I think, the old city hall.

26:35.930 --> 26:36.991
[SPEAKER_10]: But they have a screen like that.

26:37.031 --> 26:39.733
[SPEAKER_10]: You can do the weird prismatic shapes and everything.

26:39.813 --> 26:40.314
[SPEAKER_10]: That's cool.

26:40.334 --> 26:42.536
[SPEAKER_10]: They used to have animatronic dinosaurs there, too.

26:44.554 --> 26:45.994
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching.

26:46.134 --> 26:46.735
[SPEAKER_07]: See you next time.

27:06.080 --> 27:06.780
[SPEAKER_10]: I took pictures.

27:06.940 --> 27:09.301
[SPEAKER_10]: I can put them somewhere for people, I guess.

27:10.662 --> 27:12.522
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, that's what I did on Sunday.

27:12.542 --> 27:16.383
[SPEAKER_10]: The rest of my week has just been work and school and going to the chiropractor.

27:17.464 --> 27:19.744
[SPEAKER_10]: My insurance paid for me one of those exercise balls.

27:20.865 --> 27:21.165
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

27:21.425 --> 27:22.425
[SPEAKER_10]: So I've been using it.

27:24.006 --> 27:31.048
[SPEAKER_10]: And my husband's going on South Beach next week, so I'm going back to phase one on it with him.

27:31.748 --> 27:34.349
[SPEAKER_10]: So you're going to be hearing me next week going, I'm hungry!

27:35.470 --> 27:36.130
[SPEAKER_10]: I need a burrito.

27:36.571 --> 27:37.971
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll be sitting here eating Pizza Hut.

27:39.272 --> 27:40.993
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, I can eat California Pizza Kitchen.

27:41.153 --> 27:41.473
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you?

27:41.873 --> 27:43.374
[SPEAKER_10]: Because they don't bleach their flour.

27:43.774 --> 27:45.695
[SPEAKER_07]: That's some good stuff at restaurants, too.

27:46.535 --> 27:58.581
[SPEAKER_10]: But, um... But, um, at any rate, I was so worn out that day that when we got onto the Bay Bridge to go back, I opened my eyes again in Vallejo.

27:59.662 --> 28:02.483
[SPEAKER_10]: So, yeah, I was pretty much dead.

28:04.064 --> 28:04.624
[SPEAKER_10]: And, uh...

28:07.279 --> 28:10.500
[SPEAKER_10]: Really, the rest of my week has just been crap.

28:11.481 --> 28:14.322
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we did watch Batman Begins again, and I sprained my wrist.

28:16.143 --> 28:18.984
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait a minute, how did you sprain your wrist watching Batman Begins?

28:19.004 --> 28:21.945
[SPEAKER_10]: I was drinking, and I got up off the floor.

28:25.326 --> 28:26.747
[SPEAKER_07]: Does Christian Bale do it for you?

28:28.688 --> 28:32.589
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, actually, in that movie, yeah.

28:32.649 --> 28:36.791
[SPEAKER_10]: I was getting up off the floor, and I pushed my hand down and hyperextended my wrist.

28:38.117 --> 28:39.358
[SPEAKER_07]: Were you going to show them the Batcave?

28:43.241 --> 28:51.047
[SPEAKER_10]: Listeners, I'm going to give you a play-by-play of me winding up this skin from Chipotle and throwing it at Robin, hitting him in the face, which I just did.

28:54.229 --> 28:55.810
[SPEAKER_10]: Naughty, naughty boy!

28:55.830 --> 28:57.251
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but funny.

28:57.592 --> 28:58.592
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the important thing, funny.

28:59.573 --> 29:00.033
[SPEAKER_07]: I made it funny.

29:00.053 --> 29:01.875
[SPEAKER_07]: You're just pissed off because I made it funny at your expense.

29:03.256 --> 29:03.516
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

29:04.016 --> 29:04.937
[SPEAKER_07]: Bitch, you know I'm right.

29:05.778 --> 29:06.118
[SPEAKER_10]: Bitch?

29:06.438 --> 29:07.479
[SPEAKER_10]: Who do you call a bitch, bitch?

29:11.994 --> 29:15.435
[SPEAKER_10]: We were going to play Katamari last night, but we went out to TGR Fridays instead.

29:19.176 --> 29:21.657
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm so glad we have you on this video gaming station.

29:21.937 --> 29:22.217
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

29:23.977 --> 29:25.158
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to play a video game, but...

29:26.513 --> 29:27.333
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to go eat instead.

29:27.353 --> 29:29.174
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it was good.

29:29.494 --> 29:29.894
[SPEAKER_07]: It's fine.

29:30.014 --> 29:33.295
[SPEAKER_10]: And we ended up... Dan was watching The Job.

29:33.915 --> 29:34.855
[SPEAKER_10]: It has Dennis Leary.

29:35.756 --> 29:37.636
[SPEAKER_10]: I hate that show, but I love Dennis Leary.

29:38.836 --> 29:41.477
[SPEAKER_10]: I loathe just about every character on that show.

29:42.838 --> 29:46.639
[SPEAKER_10]: The last thing that I liked that I loathed every character on was Chicago.

29:47.639 --> 29:48.119
[SPEAKER_10]: But that's it.

29:48.719 --> 29:54.241
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, I'm done since you're not wasting all my time talking about stuff.

29:54.781 --> 29:55.361
[SPEAKER_07]: You know you love it.

29:56.394 --> 29:57.054
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what we do.

29:57.254 --> 29:57.515
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki.

29:57.595 --> 29:58.095
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, baby.

29:58.335 --> 29:58.995
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, how was your week?

29:59.015 --> 29:59.376
[SPEAKER_07]: How was your day?

30:00.616 --> 30:04.318
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, my week was weird, and my day was weird.

30:05.359 --> 30:08.481
[SPEAKER_04]: The entire week was filled up with two things, and it's really strange.

30:09.241 --> 30:15.164
[SPEAKER_04]: Myself playing the game The Warriors and watching the first season of Desperate Housewives.

30:15.244 --> 30:20.547
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know how those two combined, but that's... I don't get it.

30:20.767 --> 30:23.489
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, you actually sat through the whole first season of Desperate Housewives?

30:24.130 --> 30:24.890
[SPEAKER_04]: Not voluntarily.

30:25.470 --> 30:27.011
[SPEAKER_04]: Nellie was watching Desperate Housewives.

30:27.191 --> 30:28.631
[SPEAKER_04]: I was programming the webpage.

30:29.852 --> 30:33.593
[SPEAKER_04]: In a sense, I did sit through the whole first season of Desperate Housewives.

30:36.514 --> 30:36.874
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

30:38.154 --> 30:39.075
[SPEAKER_10]: I have breaking news.

30:39.395 --> 30:39.575
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

30:39.675 --> 30:41.015
[SPEAKER_10]: I just found $2 in my pocket.

30:41.556 --> 30:42.656
[SPEAKER_07]: Congratulations.

30:43.416 --> 30:45.777
[SPEAKER_07]: That's your payment for doing this show for the past three and a half years.

30:46.528 --> 30:50.011
[SPEAKER_10]: Dude, someone actually sent me a dollar.

30:50.812 --> 30:51.172
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

30:51.753 --> 30:54.535
[SPEAKER_10]: You know how in the intro it says, give her a dollar?

30:54.635 --> 30:54.975
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

30:55.055 --> 30:56.457
[SPEAKER_10]: Someone actually mailed me a dollar.

30:58.338 --> 31:00.240
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait, you gave somebody your address?

31:00.260 --> 31:01.701
[SPEAKER_10]: It was somebody I knew anyway.

31:01.761 --> 31:02.141
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, okay.

31:02.161 --> 31:04.263
[SPEAKER_10]: He was listening to the show and he mailed me a dollar.

31:04.283 --> 31:05.024
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

31:06.225 --> 31:08.067
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, we're going to be rich doing this program.

31:08.967 --> 31:10.429
[SPEAKER_07]: Get all the listeners to send us a dollar.

31:10.489 --> 31:11.730
[SPEAKER_07]: Then we'd have like five dollars.

31:14.631 --> 31:15.192
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

31:35.779 --> 31:36.499
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all I have to say.

31:36.579 --> 31:36.980
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

31:37.180 --> 31:41.882
[SPEAKER_04]: The whole scope of the show, they have one character at least that someone can identify with.

31:41.902 --> 31:44.823
[SPEAKER_04]: They have the four different type of women and stuff like that.

31:45.383 --> 31:47.184
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I don't know.

31:47.404 --> 31:49.465
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a bad show.

31:49.525 --> 31:56.828
[SPEAKER_04]: It's well written, I guess, but not exactly something that most heterosexual males would be caught dead watching.

31:59.109 --> 32:00.709
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

32:00.890 --> 32:04.251
[SPEAKER_04]: For me, it had the same feel as Dead Like Me and Wonderfall's.

32:04.687 --> 32:32.687
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the same type of thing, where each show has like a theme to it, that type of thing Oh shit, Extra Pro, we're missing out, those two shows are great So, that's what it, I mean, I've got the DVD set, got it for free, thank God, I didn't pay for it So yeah, guess what is up next, I have to watch Season 1 of Lost now I really don't want to sit through that, so, but, whatever Anyways, so yeah, it's been that, working on the webpage, playing the Warriors And not getting to play any other games I wanted to play, because, you know, the TV is being taken up

32:33.692 --> 32:37.074
[SPEAKER_07]: So what did you do for the website?

32:37.914 --> 32:46.558
[SPEAKER_04]: I created a wonderful kick-ass shout box for our PSP site with a nice virtual keyboard on there and everything.

32:46.638 --> 32:47.238
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks pretty.

32:47.759 --> 32:53.681
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so you can go there and give us a shout out over on olrpsp.com.

32:54.022 --> 32:56.643
[SPEAKER_07]: But again, that website is really for viewing on your PSP.

32:56.863 --> 32:58.984
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll work in a normal browser, but it looks ugly.

32:59.935 --> 33:01.698
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't look as pretty, let's put it that way.

33:01.718 --> 33:05.604
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it is still pretty, but it's prettier if you look at it on PSP.

33:06.045 --> 33:07.266
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it's made for the PSP.

33:08.268 --> 33:10.912
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, it looks better than our regular website, I gotta say.

33:12.735 --> 33:13.015
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh well.

33:13.075 --> 33:13.396
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

33:13.777 --> 33:14.598
[SPEAKER_07]: That's alright, what can you do?

33:15.506 --> 33:18.388
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, that's pretty much what I've been doing this week.

33:19.089 --> 33:24.773
[SPEAKER_04]: Just lots of work and trying to put some video games in there.

33:25.394 --> 33:27.856
[SPEAKER_04]: Play Grand Theft Auto Liberty Stories for all five minutes.

33:28.516 --> 33:31.058
[SPEAKER_04]: That's about all the attention that I can dedicate to that game.

33:31.459 --> 33:32.099
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it that bad?

33:32.660 --> 33:34.581
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I just can't dedicate enough attention to the game.

33:34.661 --> 33:35.782
[SPEAKER_07]: Too busy watching Desperate Housewives?

33:35.802 --> 33:38.604
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm too busy doing tons of stuff.

33:39.045 --> 33:39.365
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

33:40.034 --> 33:45.944
[SPEAKER_04]: Liberty City Stories, it's like, I don't even have time for most of the stuff on the PSP, so, I don't know.

33:47.386 --> 33:48.508
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be fun playing multiplayer, though.

33:48.528 --> 33:49.590
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, I'm done.

33:51.570 --> 33:54.612
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess I'll talk about my week real fast, then we'll get to our guests, and they can talk about their week.

33:56.273 --> 33:57.294
[SPEAKER_07]: My week was okay.

33:57.374 --> 34:02.898
[SPEAKER_07]: It was actually really busy, because I had an awful lot of work stuff this week, and I was even there one night until like 7 o'clock, and that's just sad.

34:04.379 --> 34:06.261
[SPEAKER_07]: So I haven't really gotten a chance to do a whole lot else.

34:06.281 --> 34:08.902
[SPEAKER_07]: I did buy some new games, and I'll talk about those on this week's podcast.

34:09.443 --> 34:11.624
[SPEAKER_07]: Soul Calibur III I've been playing an awful lot of, as well as...

34:13.125 --> 34:16.248
[SPEAKER_07]: Midway Arcade Treasures 3, which Loki gave me last week.

34:16.588 --> 34:22.152
[SPEAKER_07]: And I started playing Taito, but I'm going to save that for the week after podcast because I didn't get to play it really enough.

34:22.652 --> 34:24.213
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm going to talk about those games.

34:24.814 --> 34:27.676
[SPEAKER_07]: And not a whole lot else, really.

34:29.097 --> 34:40.345
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I didn't do a lot for Halloween, which is kind of, even though Halloween's technically tomorrow, I've really done a lot for Halloween, which is kind of too bad, except playing World of Warcraft and trick-or-treating inside of World of Warcraft, which is really nerdy.

34:40.985 --> 34:41.045
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

34:41.786 --> 34:42.267
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

34:58.684 --> 35:01.405
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's one of those towns where the college pretty much runs the town.

35:01.445 --> 35:05.647
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, like the keg is the national flower and stuff in Chico.

35:05.827 --> 35:07.928
[SPEAKER_07]: So it was good times, though.

35:08.048 --> 35:08.488
[SPEAKER_07]: Good times.

35:08.848 --> 35:10.169
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, just did a little bit of drinking.

35:10.329 --> 35:11.229
[SPEAKER_07]: Good times.

35:11.830 --> 35:13.911
[SPEAKER_07]: We drank butterbeer, like Harry Potter.

35:13.931 --> 35:14.891
[SPEAKER_07]: You know how they had the butterbeer?

35:15.371 --> 35:15.971
[SPEAKER_07]: We drank butterbeer.

35:15.991 --> 35:16.992
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what they put in butterbeer?

35:17.893 --> 35:18.413
[SPEAKER_08]: What is that?

35:18.473 --> 35:21.577
[SPEAKER_08]: Butterscotch schnapps, root beer, and vodka.

35:22.398 --> 35:31.909
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, when we went to the party last year, the one that Rice Princess threw, we had the butter beer there, and it was actually really good.

35:32.890 --> 35:36.775
[SPEAKER_08]: Everything there was really good, and then I got sick and put in the hospital the next day.

35:38.502 --> 35:40.344
[SPEAKER_08]: Xtifer had two major surgeries last year.

36:01.212 --> 36:02.873
[SPEAKER_08]: I did have two major surgeries last week.

36:02.893 --> 36:04.314
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe he didn't want me to say that on the show.

36:04.894 --> 36:08.696
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, no, it's okay to say that.

36:08.896 --> 36:09.596
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm fine with it.

36:10.617 --> 36:11.757
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm over it.

36:12.038 --> 36:13.018
[SPEAKER_08]: Extrovert's been cut up.

36:13.318 --> 36:15.980
[SPEAKER_08]: I have been cut up.

36:16.060 --> 36:17.901
[SPEAKER_08]: Lost a gallbladder, lost an appendix.

36:18.001 --> 36:20.782
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm 10% less Christopher than you saw before that.

36:22.703 --> 36:24.444
[SPEAKER_08]: I have room in me to stuff things.

36:25.825 --> 36:26.585
[SPEAKER_07]: Good, you'll need that.

36:27.485 --> 36:28.586
[SPEAKER_08]: Like cocaine and stuff.

36:29.748 --> 36:30.408
[SPEAKER_08]: So is it my turn?

36:30.828 --> 36:31.489
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, how was your week?

36:31.509 --> 36:31.849
[SPEAKER_03]: How was your day?

36:32.049 --> 36:42.553
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, well, while Loki was getting in touch with his feminine side, I was, you know, doing my show on Monday, and I had a really good turnout.

36:43.273 --> 36:48.255
[SPEAKER_08]: Lots of listeners, 14 listeners, which was really good.

36:49.056 --> 36:54.638
[SPEAKER_08]: And I enjoyed it, and I can't wait to do it again tomorrow and stuff.

36:55.818 --> 36:59.401
[SPEAKER_08]: And also, I played an assload of World of Warcraft this week.

37:00.742 --> 37:01.322
[SPEAKER_08]: Addict.

37:01.563 --> 37:06.406
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, it's almost too sad to really talk about.

37:07.287 --> 37:13.792
[SPEAKER_08]: Yesterday, I went to a movie, which I guess I'll get to later on in the show.

37:14.573 --> 37:18.416
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's just say I saw a movie with my sister.

37:18.716 --> 37:20.978
[SPEAKER_08]: My sister saw it, too!

37:23.504 --> 37:25.326
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay?

37:26.287 --> 37:31.192
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you may want to look forward to my movie review later on.

37:31.572 --> 37:33.754
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll be spectabulous.

37:36.637 --> 37:36.917
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

37:37.097 --> 37:38.459
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, it'll be tabulous.

37:38.819 --> 37:39.640
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, tab.

37:39.680 --> 37:40.661
[SPEAKER_07]: Give the microphone to Angel.

37:40.821 --> 37:41.021
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

37:41.341 --> 37:41.742
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

37:42.082 --> 37:42.823
[SPEAKER_07]: Angel, how was your week?

37:42.843 --> 37:43.283
[SPEAKER_07]: How was your day?

37:43.363 --> 37:43.784
[SPEAKER_10]: Mine?

37:43.984 --> 37:46.386
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, pretty good.

37:48.038 --> 37:51.721
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for watching, and I'll see you next time.

38:04.680 --> 38:05.260
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh-huh?

38:05.300 --> 38:10.045
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie allows yourself to get tied up with chatting with our chatters at OrangeLiveJournal.com.

38:10.485 --> 38:13.408
[SPEAKER_10]: I really want my friends to listen to LiveJournal.

38:13.849 --> 38:16.111
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, I really don't want to know what that is.

38:16.191 --> 38:17.312
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you paste that in chat?

38:17.592 --> 38:18.013
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I did.

38:18.073 --> 38:21.156
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a birthday cake with a giant cock on it, basically.

38:21.176 --> 38:22.878
[SPEAKER_07]: And it has piercings with a cock ring.

38:22.898 --> 38:24.439
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not talking about a chicken.

38:28.523 --> 38:30.905
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice that she did that right when I have the mic.

38:30.925 --> 38:31.705
[SPEAKER_08]: It's balls look horrible.

38:32.105 --> 38:33.827
[SPEAKER_10]: That's not fair!

38:33.847 --> 38:37.169
[SPEAKER_08]: It's balls look diseased or something.

38:37.949 --> 38:39.470
[SPEAKER_08]: The balls look like kushes.

38:40.291 --> 38:41.011
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, seriously.

38:41.031 --> 38:42.232
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, Abel, please continue.

38:42.252 --> 38:43.052
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry, Abel.

38:44.313 --> 38:45.334
[SPEAKER_10]: Now I forgot what I was saying.

38:45.834 --> 38:46.254
[SPEAKER_10]: Damn it.

38:46.855 --> 38:47.235
[SPEAKER_10]: Damn it.

38:47.415 --> 38:47.695
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

38:48.876 --> 38:49.416
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, yeah.

38:49.777 --> 38:55.600
[SPEAKER_10]: I had a lot of school stuff to do, but then other than that, it was pretty much gearing up for BlizzCon, even though I didn't really go, but I...

38:56.761 --> 38:57.722
[SPEAKER_10]: Know a lot of stuff now.

38:58.462 --> 38:59.103
[SPEAKER_10]: After the fact.

39:00.063 --> 39:01.484
[SPEAKER_10]: We can get to that later if you wish.

39:01.564 --> 39:01.864
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure.

39:02.064 --> 39:04.766
[SPEAKER_10]: Considering there's a lot of stuff to talk about.

39:06.847 --> 39:08.468
[SPEAKER_10]: I played a lot of World of Warcraft.

39:08.528 --> 39:11.910
[SPEAKER_10]: I shouldn't have, but I did and it was fun.

39:12.071 --> 39:14.732
[SPEAKER_10]: All the cool kids play World of Warcraft now.

39:14.992 --> 39:16.173
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to pull an extrovert here.

39:16.493 --> 39:23.718
[SPEAKER_07]: When we talk about World of Warcraft, the fact that we're going to be bringing it up, it might have your ears burning.

39:25.819 --> 39:29.827
[SPEAKER_07]: and then we'll be on a crusade later to tell you all the latest information.

39:32.569 --> 39:35.250
[SPEAKER_08]: I bet it was interesting to see.

39:35.730 --> 39:37.890
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh wait, I mean, oh, never mind.

39:38.830 --> 39:39.150
[SPEAKER_08]: Shut up.

39:39.951 --> 39:40.411
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, Angel.

39:41.031 --> 40:00.515
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, and not that I ever talk about that other game called There, but I kind of got nominated for this big council thing where you work with staff and you work with 15 other people and I get to find out tomorrow if I...

40:01.331 --> 40:02.312

41:03.941 --> 41:04.221
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway.

[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I love how our show gets visual at some points.

41:14.008 --> 41:14.728
[SPEAKER_07]: Great radio, gang.

41:15.129 --> 41:15.629
[SPEAKER_07]: Great radio.

[SPEAKER_10]: Website again.

41:16.650 --> 41:18.391
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway.

41:19.572 --> 41:21.033
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it, I guess.

41:22.254 --> 41:22.594
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, bye.

41:23.803 --> 41:29.867
[SPEAKER_08]: We should have a show or something where we just watch a movie and all it is is just our reactions to it.

41:30.448 --> 41:33.190
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, oh my god, what'd you do?

41:33.290 --> 41:34.610
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god, take that out!

41:34.711 --> 41:35.991
[SPEAKER_08]: Take that out!

41:36.011 --> 41:37.512
[SPEAKER_08]: Do not go back there!

41:37.673 --> 41:39.694
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god, not in the Batcave!

41:40.134 --> 41:41.115
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh no, no!

41:42.996 --> 41:44.557
[SPEAKER_10]: And then make all my bodies to jump!

41:46.178 --> 41:47.159
[SPEAKER_10]: Not in the back door!

41:47.359 --> 41:48.340
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't go in the back door!

41:51.997 --> 41:53.358
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god, she's been backdoored!

41:58.942 --> 41:59.603
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, anyway.

42:00.844 --> 42:02.345
[SPEAKER_07]: I think this show's in need of a break.

42:02.445 --> 42:05.547
[SPEAKER_07]: And when we come back from this break, we're going to talk about some actual video game related things.

42:06.068 --> 42:08.790
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to talk about Ultramix 3, because there's a whole shitload of news on Ultramix 3.

42:09.610 --> 42:13.053
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we're going to talk a little bit about the Burning Crusade.

42:14.033 --> 42:14.754
[SPEAKER_17]: Hot.

42:15.194 --> 42:19.518
[SPEAKER_07]: Because now that we've all become World of Warcraft whores, we have to dedicate a little piece of our show to that.

42:19.738 --> 42:20.178
[SPEAKER_10]: Hot.

42:20.698 --> 42:21.059
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

42:22.813 --> 42:25.154

[SPEAKER_17]: Hi, welcome back kids.

50:42.751 --> 50:44.831
[SPEAKER_07]: We're on Orange Lounge Radio here again.

50:45.351 --> 50:47.251
[SPEAKER_07]: Another week, another Sunday, another show.

[SPEAKER_07]: Our 162nd show.

50:50.692 --> 50:51.872
[SPEAKER_07]: If you can believe it.

50:52.652 --> 50:53.412
[SPEAKER_07]: God, I'm old.

50:53.612 --> 50:54.112
[SPEAKER_10]: No, just kidding.

50:54.252 --> 50:55.353
[SPEAKER_10]: Not counting the half shows.

50:56.053 --> 50:56.913
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, very true.

50:57.527 --> 50:57.991
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.com

50:59.804 --> 51:02.005
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm old as far as shows.

51:02.605 --> 51:02.905
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

51:03.405 --> 51:04.545
[SPEAKER_07]: You've been here since what?

51:04.705 --> 51:04.545
37.

51:04.725 --> 51:06.926
[SPEAKER_07]: 37?

51:04.825 --> 51:06.926
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought it was 27.

51:07.046 --> 51:07.306
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

51:07.846 --> 51:08.366
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, wait.

51:09.246 --> 51:09.526
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, well.

51:09.946 --> 51:11.107
[SPEAKER_07]: A long time.

51:11.427 --> 51:11.107
27.

51:11.987 --> 51:12.307
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.

51:13.007 --> 51:16.808
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, again, ever since, you know, God, when did we start doing the podcast?

51:16.968 --> 51:20.929
[SPEAKER_07]: It was January of this year, so it was like around 110 or so in show numbers.

51:21.529 --> 51:22.429
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I just, no, not that.

51:22.489 --> 51:23.870
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess it would be sooner than that, about 120, 130.

51:24.190 --> 51:27.391
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, it was when we really started getting a lot of new people.

51:27.431 --> 51:28.011
[SPEAKER_07]: Gee, I wonder why.

51:28.551 --> 51:28.631
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh...

51:28.971 --> 51:29.932
[SPEAKER_19]: www.DarkSakura.com

51:50.194 --> 52:08.523
[SPEAKER_07]: And also, we just announced this last week, so some of you guys might have missed this, but now, not only can you call in over the Skype line by calling our username at Orange Lounge Radio, but you can actually call us on the phone, 916-226-9067 is the Orange Lounge Radio number, so you'll be able to call in to that very soon.

52:08.903 --> 52:09.623
[SPEAKER_07]: So, very cool.

52:10.183 --> 52:11.604
[SPEAKER_07]: You missed that, Jamie, that was last week.

52:11.644 --> 52:13.305
[SPEAKER_07]: We have an actual number now.

52:14.766 --> 52:21.411
[SPEAKER_07]: So we can get even more people calling in and telling us to go fuck ourselves.

52:22.052 --> 52:23.954
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, 916-226-9067.

52:24.915 --> 52:25.995
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't call yet, we're not answering.

52:28.638 --> 52:32.501
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see, we also have our chat room going on, www.orangeentrader.com.

52:32.541 --> 52:39.467
[SPEAKER_07]: Click on chat and you can see all these folks chatting, including Dirty Thief, who keeps wanting to get me to say his name.

52:39.867 --> 52:40.468
[SPEAKER_07]: So there you have it.

52:41.229 --> 52:41.609
[SPEAKER_07]: I said it.

52:44.294 --> 52:54.586
[SPEAKER_07]: Dan's Dance Revolution Ultra Mix 3 is on its way out and they've been taking it out on tour.

52:54.646 --> 52:59.811
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if you guys heard about the Konami tour, but Konami's going around and touring the nation right now.

53:00.492 --> 53:03.235
[SPEAKER_07]: And when I say nation, I mean a couple of select states.

53:04.376 --> 53:10.738
[SPEAKER_07]: They already did the ones in California, but neglected to tell anybody that it was going on in the DDR community, so none of us thought to go out.

53:11.318 --> 53:14.819
[SPEAKER_07]: But it was in Southern California anyway, so we here at OLR wouldn't have been able to go.

53:15.219 --> 53:22.661
[SPEAKER_07]: But right now, this past weekend, they have been in Texas, and they were in Texas today, and that's the last opportunity to catch them in Texas.

53:23.222 --> 53:27.003
[SPEAKER_07]: However, they're going to go to Illinois over November 4th, 5th, and 6th.

53:28.764 --> 53:31.767
[SPEAKER_07]: And then they'll be in Massachusetts, 11th, 12th, and 13th.

53:32.107 --> 53:38.614
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the New York, New Jersey area, mostly New Jersey, 18th, 19th, and 20th of November.

53:38.894 --> 53:43.199
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you want to check out the exact locations, we've got them posted on our site, OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

53:43.239 --> 53:45.521
[SPEAKER_07]: Just look for the little story about the mall tour and click read more.

53:45.922 --> 53:50.827
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, because of the mall tour, people have been getting to play final builds of the game.

53:52.407 --> 53:55.068
[SPEAKER_07]: and came back to report a song list.

53:55.088 --> 53:59.030
[SPEAKER_07]: The song list is also posted on our website, www.orangezonesradio.com.

53:59.890 --> 54:02.171
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess I'll go ahead and read through the song list here.

54:02.632 --> 54:16.538
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, people have put together, based on the song names, because what somebody did on DDR Freak is they went to the tour and just wrote down all the names, but they neglected to write down all the artists, so they've kind of just been piecing it together, which artists go with which songs.

54:17.598 --> 54:19.459
[SPEAKER_07]: So we know about Akumajou Dracula Medley.

54:20.139 --> 54:25.801
[SPEAKER_07]: This group, Blackalicious, has a song called Alphabet Aerobics, which should be very interesting.

54:25.901 --> 54:28.421
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I actually might have a copy of it on my machine somewhere.

54:28.441 --> 54:30.382
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to have to take a look.

54:30.462 --> 54:33.863
[SPEAKER_07]: Bag by Revenge, of course, from DDR Extreme.

54:34.483 --> 54:36.744

[SPEAKER_07]: Or If Is with Basile.

54:40.445 --> 54:43.486
[SPEAKER_07]: No FX with Bath of Least Resistance.

54:43.926 --> 54:45.387
[SPEAKER_10]: That's going to be interesting.

54:45.407 --> 54:45.707
[SPEAKER_07]: No FX.

54:46.047 --> 54:46.687
[SPEAKER_07]: That should be interesting.

[SPEAKER_07]: Conflict, the Turmoil Mix by the Azoic, Crazy in Love, which is the Karaoke Revolution crossover that was also in Extreme 2, Daikin Kai, also in Extreme 2, Danza da Yuka by Big Idea, which I believe is on the viewer, I can't remember, Delta 32 is a song by We Don't Know Who, Destiny Lovers, a song from, I think, Extreme, I think, it's been a long time, uh, Extreme

55:34.528 --> 55:52.646
[SPEAKER_07]: Drivin' by Naoki, which was in 2DX, Emotion, there's an old school song for you, Emotion, from the Club of Pens, I believe, Eversnow from Max 2, Firefly by B4U, Frozen Ray, but it says Dirty Hurts, like it's a remix of Frozen Ray by DJ Taka.

55:53.167 --> 55:56.230
[SPEAKER_07]: It was the one that was on the V-Rare.

55:56.870 --> 55:57.251

56:15.031 --> 56:16.532
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm glad they didn't pick that song.

56:18.534 --> 56:22.798
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I was gonna talk about my friend's funny dance to My Humps.

56:22.818 --> 56:23.979
[SPEAKER_07]: You know my friend Billy, right?

56:24.359 --> 56:24.599
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

56:24.659 --> 56:26.761
[SPEAKER_07]: He got really drunk at the party and started dancing to My Humps.

56:27.141 --> 56:28.483
[SPEAKER_07]: My Humps, My Humps.

56:30.304 --> 56:31.025
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe in Ultramix 4.

[SPEAKER_07]: Hot on the Phone, which we don't know who it's by.

56:34.831 --> 56:37.073
[SPEAKER_07]: It sounds like erotic, but it's not.

[SPEAKER_07]: That's not one of their songs.

56:38.474 --> 56:40.036

56:49.544 --> 56:56.229
[SPEAKER_07]: Real Life did the song Send Me an Angel years and years ago, and they still play it at the goth clubs and stuff, so it should be interesting that they're in there.

56:56.790 --> 57:00.673
[SPEAKER_07]: A song called Insaner by Joni and Spesh.

57:01.789 --> 57:02.169

[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to see which one of these songs.

57:10.134 --> 57:11.555
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe they just like it better that way.

57:11.655 --> 57:14.716

01:02:11.707 --> 01:02:15.370
[SPEAKER_07]: So, shit, we're going to have to pay more to fit 100 people on stuff now.

01:02:15.410 --> 01:02:16.211
[SPEAKER_07]: So, anyway.

01:02:17.898 --> 01:02:18.398
[SPEAKER_07]: Good job, you guys.

01:02:18.418 --> 01:02:19.759
[SPEAKER_10]: That's where we put up the PayPal link.

01:02:19.879 --> 01:02:20.119
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

01:02:20.159 --> 01:02:22.400
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we're going to have to put up the PayPal link now.

01:02:22.901 --> 01:02:25.002
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you guys for listening and making us successful.

01:02:25.042 --> 01:02:30.325
[SPEAKER_07]: If you are on the stream right now, don't disconnect because there are people in the chat room that are pissed that they can't get in.

01:02:30.705 --> 01:02:33.627
[SPEAKER_07]: So, we'll see.

01:02:33.707 --> 01:02:35.208
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, let's go to another clip.

01:02:35.228 --> 01:02:37.169
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a clip of, we played this on the show before.

01:02:37.189 --> 01:02:38.169
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to play this for you guys again.

01:02:38.429 --> 01:02:39.550
[SPEAKER_07]: Midi Head with Raise Your Hands.

01:02:53.704 --> 01:02:54.610
Thank you for watching!

01:03:55.871 --> 01:03:56.851
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, let's do another clip.

01:03:56.871 --> 01:04:01.874
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a song by Real Life called Imperfection, which is one that we named off.

01:04:01.914 --> 01:04:02.694
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be in DDR.

01:04:03.854 --> 01:04:11.117
This is my imperfection Waiting for your direction

01:04:43.601 --> 01:04:50.045
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm never coming down again I'm never coming down I'm in love and love is what I like

01:05:11.411 --> 01:05:17.158
[SPEAKER_13]: We look for your direction This is my imperfection We look for resurrection

01:05:57.594 --> 01:06:01.015
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, that was another clip of a song that's going to be in Ultramix 3, Real Life with Imperfection.

01:06:01.175 --> 01:06:03.736
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't find Istanbul.

01:06:03.956 --> 01:06:06.397
[SPEAKER_07]: I know I had that song years ago, so I'm going to have to get that.

01:06:06.437 --> 01:06:10.738
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll play some more clips on some later shows before the game gets out, so check it out.

01:06:10.978 --> 01:06:12.959
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you guys think of this Ultramix 3 song list?

01:06:12.979 --> 01:06:14.439
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm curious to hear your feedback.

01:06:14.819 --> 01:06:15.299
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura?

01:06:15.700 --> 01:06:16.700
[SPEAKER_10]: Not quite so generic.

01:06:17.520 --> 01:06:18.941
[SPEAKER_07]: It's very diverse, isn't it?

01:06:19.421 --> 01:06:23.222
[SPEAKER_07]: They're definitely going for a very diverse listing, aren't they?

01:06:23.797 --> 01:06:25.098
[SPEAKER_10]: It is very diverse.

01:06:25.198 --> 01:06:28.019
[SPEAKER_10]: I like the system that they're so diverse.

01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:33.823
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, frickin' Ray Charles and Noah FX in the same mix.

01:06:33.843 --> 01:06:34.443
[SPEAKER_07]: That's crazy.

01:06:34.663 --> 01:06:35.383
[SPEAKER_10]: That's pretty cute.

01:06:36.484 --> 01:06:37.124
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you think, Loki?

01:06:38.505 --> 01:06:39.506
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, it's pretty cool.

01:06:39.686 --> 01:06:43.788
[SPEAKER_04]: I just don't have an Xbox, so... Well, you have the 360, though, right?

01:06:43.808 --> 01:06:46.350
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it doesn't mean it's gonna work on it.

01:06:48.087 --> 01:06:50.948
[SPEAKER_04]: Angel, what do you think of the Ultimix 3 songs there?

01:07:15.757 --> 01:07:17.158
[SPEAKER_10]: Like you said, pretty diverse.

01:07:18.119 --> 01:07:19.060
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I'm looking forward to it.

01:07:19.100 --> 01:07:19.901
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see what happens.

01:07:31.106 --> 01:07:40.709
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, one other thing I want to point out about Ultramix 3 is that also what's been revealed in the demo is that they're going to have a .5 speed.

01:07:41.189 --> 01:07:43.590
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's like it's going to be able to slow down the arrows.

01:07:43.610 --> 01:07:46.351
[SPEAKER_07]: So those of you guys that say, Max 300 is too fast.

01:07:46.371 --> 01:07:48.251
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, now you'll have a .5 modifier.

01:07:48.631 --> 01:07:49.732
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's going to be very interesting.

01:07:51.512 --> 01:07:55.013
[SPEAKER_07]: And also, if you can play bag on .5, that would be very impressive.

01:07:57.314 --> 01:08:00.455
[SPEAKER_07]: I know it's been done like on, excuse me,

01:08:02.256 --> 01:08:08.097
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that that stuff's been done on StepMania and stuff, but it's nice to see it acknowledged in real DDR.

01:08:12.899 --> 01:08:15.859
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, what arcade mix had the .5 on it?

01:08:15.899 --> 01:08:17.780
[SPEAKER_07]: Wasn't there one of the bootlegs or something?

01:08:17.940 --> 01:08:26.902
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone hacked Extreme with the .5 speed and the wave and break.

01:08:27.779 --> 01:08:29.140
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio

01:08:57.523 --> 01:08:58.004
[SPEAKER_27]: Hey, what's up?

01:08:58.064 --> 01:08:58.604
[SPEAKER_27]: It's Ranma.

01:08:58.925 --> 01:08:59.846
[SPEAKER_27]: Hey, Ranma, how are you?

01:09:00.166 --> 01:09:01.788
[SPEAKER_27]: Ranma!

01:09:02.468 --> 01:09:02.749
[SPEAKER_27]: What?

01:09:02.889 --> 01:09:04.130
[SPEAKER_27]: Hey, Jamie, what's up?

01:09:05.952 --> 01:09:07.955
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, this is the ultimate test of the message, Mark.

01:09:08.055 --> 01:09:10.337
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm currently on the road as we speak.

01:09:10.597 --> 01:09:11.839
[SPEAKER_07]: You're currently on the road?

01:09:13.072 --> 01:09:14.834
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, I'm coming back to my niece's house.

01:09:14.914 --> 01:09:16.176
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm on the bus heading back home.

01:09:31.550 --> 01:09:37.492
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, I'm not too worried about it, because when I did host somebody in the chatroom, it was actually taped in the show, so I'll definitely get a copy.

01:09:37.572 --> 01:09:42.214
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I heard about our bootleggers we got going on, so that's cool.

01:09:42.474 --> 01:09:43.094
[SPEAKER_07]: It's flattering.

01:09:43.334 --> 01:09:43.855
[SPEAKER_07]: Who said hey?

01:09:44.155 --> 01:09:47.096
[SPEAKER_27]: I call it syndication underground.

01:09:47.516 --> 01:09:47.956
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, okay.

01:09:48.256 --> 01:09:48.756
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all good.

01:09:48.896 --> 01:09:49.297
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all good.

01:09:49.557 --> 01:09:53.458
[SPEAKER_07]: We can't officially support it because of the licensed music issue, but yeah.

01:09:53.658 --> 01:09:54.659
[SPEAKER_10]: We're underground.

01:09:54.699 --> 01:09:55.499
[SPEAKER_10]: That's cool.

01:09:57.820 --> 01:09:58.080
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:00.921
[SPEAKER_27]: First of all, happy Halloween to you guys.

01:10:01.300 --> 01:10:01.961
[SPEAKER_07]: Happy Halloween.

01:10:01.981 --> 01:10:02.982
[SPEAKER_07]: What are you doing for your Halloween?

01:10:04.463 --> 01:10:10.548
[SPEAKER_27]: We're going to hang out tomorrow dressed as Naruto characters and just go enter the parade in downtown Manhattan.

01:10:10.969 --> 01:10:11.609
[SPEAKER_07]: Nerds.

01:10:12.350 --> 01:10:12.870
[SPEAKER_07]: No, that's cool.

01:10:13.051 --> 01:10:13.971
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, right we are.

01:10:14.532 --> 01:10:16.333
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm wearing big black wings tomorrow.

01:10:16.994 --> 01:10:17.675
[SPEAKER_10]: They're feathery.

01:10:19.316 --> 01:10:21.458
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to go around reaping my fellow co-workers.

01:10:22.859 --> 01:10:23.100
[SPEAKER_27]: Uh-oh.

01:10:25.339 --> 01:10:28.642
[SPEAKER_27]: and last night we had a Halloween party out in Queensland.

01:10:28.702 --> 01:10:34.266
[SPEAKER_27]: Let's just say everybody got trashed and let's just say it boils down to this.

01:10:34.726 --> 01:10:38.229
[SPEAKER_27]: Whatever happens at a Halloween party stays at a Halloween party.

01:10:39.430 --> 01:10:40.071
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh.

01:10:40.351 --> 01:10:42.052
[SPEAKER_27]: You have to be there to understand.

01:10:42.212 --> 01:10:43.213
[SPEAKER_27]: Let's see about some of that.

01:10:43.273 --> 01:10:44.674
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, good watching.

01:10:45.115 --> 01:10:45.955
[SPEAKER_07]: One of those things.

01:10:46.075 --> 01:10:51.580
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we've got to kind of keep it short tonight because we've got a ton of people trying to get in, but anything else you want to say?

01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:51.900
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got to.

[SPEAKER_25]: It's Nintendomaniac64.

01:11:31.363 --> 01:11:33.324
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, Nintendomaniac64, why are you pissed?

01:11:37.150 --> 01:11:41.010
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what to say.

01:11:41.050 --> 01:11:42.631
[SPEAKER_07]: We've never been in this situation before.

01:11:43.011 --> 01:11:44.951
[SPEAKER_07]: One other time we were in this situation.

01:11:45.271 --> 01:11:48.052
[SPEAKER_07]: We've been on the air for three and a half years now.

01:11:48.132 --> 01:11:49.212
[SPEAKER_07]: Literally three and a half years.

01:11:49.652 --> 01:11:52.873
[SPEAKER_07]: And we've only one other time been this popular.

01:11:52.913 --> 01:11:56.174
[SPEAKER_07]: And the only reason we had so many people trying to get in that episode...

01:11:56.374 --> 01:11:56.874
[SPEAKER_07]: People get pissed.

01:11:56.954 --> 01:11:57.495
[SPEAKER_07]: People get pissed.

01:12:25.939 --> 01:12:27.040
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'm sorry.

01:12:27.340 --> 01:12:31.623
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to look at what we can do about increasing the cap so we can get more listeners in during the show.

01:12:31.683 --> 01:12:35.446
[SPEAKER_07]: But for tonight, you guys are a little bit screwed.

01:12:35.766 --> 01:12:36.567
[SPEAKER_07]: But you know what?

01:12:36.627 --> 01:12:38.989
[SPEAKER_07]: Go into our chat room at orangelaunchradio.com and click on chat.

01:12:39.109 --> 01:12:46.674
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's people that can help you catch up on what you missed, so to speak, if you know what I mean.

01:12:46.714 --> 01:12:46.955
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

01:12:47.055 --> 01:12:47.935
[SPEAKER_07]: Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.

01:12:49.697 --> 01:12:49.897
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah.

01:12:50.277 --> 01:12:51.378
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

01:12:51.418 --> 01:12:54.100
[SPEAKER_07]: Anything you want to say gaming related or related to the show?

01:12:55.478 --> 01:12:57.459
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, uh, you said you got Midway Arcade Treasures 3?

01:12:57.499 --> 01:13:00.620
[SPEAKER_24]: Uh, run that by me one more time, you broke up a little bit there?

01:13:02.441 --> 01:13:04.602
[SPEAKER_24]: You said you got Midway Arcade Treasures 3?

01:13:05.063 --> 01:13:06.403
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I got Midway Arcade Treasures 3.

01:13:08.444 --> 01:13:11.686
[SPEAKER_07]: Cool, I've been trying, like, forever to get that game.

01:13:12.346 --> 01:13:19.670
[SPEAKER_07]: Really, it's not, I, I got it thanks to Loki, so I didn't try to go out and buy it in the store or anything, so, I guess I got kinda lucky.

01:13:20.010 --> 01:13:22.631
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, not like, not trying forever, but I mean, like,

01:13:24.026 --> 01:13:24.927
[SPEAKER_25]: I can't drive yet.

01:13:44.962 --> 01:13:51.086
[SPEAKER_07]: Midway Arcade Treasures 3, of course, is the eight driving games kind of all put in one game.

01:13:52.527 --> 01:14:00.413
[SPEAKER_07]: Classics like Hydro Thunder and Stun Runner and my favorite, Iron Man Off-Road with the track pack as well, which I think is awesome.

01:14:00.793 --> 01:14:02.274
[SPEAKER_07]: So anyway, let's go to another call.

01:14:02.334 --> 01:14:04.536
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go to this one.

01:14:05.076 --> 01:14:05.977
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

01:14:08.879 --> 01:14:10.440
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

01:14:11.841 --> 01:14:12.501
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello.

01:14:12.802 --> 01:14:13.062
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello.

01:14:14.178 --> 01:14:14.398
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi.

01:14:14.418 --> 01:14:15.519
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, who's this?

01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:17.420
[SPEAKER_11]: This is Roz again.

01:14:17.540 --> 01:14:18.221
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, Roz.

01:14:18.241 --> 01:14:18.721
[SPEAKER_07]: How are you?

01:14:18.821 --> 01:14:19.342
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, Roz.

01:14:20.402 --> 01:14:20.923
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi.

01:14:22.064 --> 01:14:22.384
[SPEAKER_07]: What's up?

01:14:22.404 --> 01:14:22.964
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm pretty good.

01:14:23.104 --> 01:14:29.029
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, I feel really damn great because I had my first ever Red Bull today.

01:14:30.230 --> 01:14:30.550
What?

01:14:31.130 --> 01:14:32.391
[SPEAKER_07]: She had her first Red Bull today.

01:14:32.731 --> 01:14:33.572
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, shit.

01:14:34.891 --> 01:14:35.832
[SPEAKER_07]: Red Bull is the color of pee.

01:14:52.543 --> 01:14:52.843
[SPEAKER_11]: It is.

01:14:52.983 --> 01:14:54.845
[SPEAKER_11]: It really looks a lot like it.

01:14:55.445 --> 01:15:00.428
[SPEAKER_11]: That's why it's in a can, not a clear bottle.

01:15:00.668 --> 01:15:02.369
[SPEAKER_07]: So why are you drinking Red Bull tonight?

01:15:02.390 --> 01:15:04.631
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you just drinking it for recreational purposes?

01:15:06.352 --> 01:15:13.697
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I had never had one before, and I was going to get bottled water, but they were out of it for some reason, like at the little store place I was at.

01:15:14.614 --> 01:15:18.436
[SPEAKER_11]: So the other thing that they had that was like cold was Red Bull.

01:15:18.816 --> 01:15:22.298
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just picked one out and decided to drink it today.

01:15:23.318 --> 01:15:24.199
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel great.

01:15:25.960 --> 01:15:27.981
[SPEAKER_07]: You kind of sound like you're really happy.

01:15:30.242 --> 01:15:30.902
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just messing with you.

01:15:30.922 --> 01:15:32.063
[SPEAKER_10]: That's great.

01:15:32.883 --> 01:15:35.284
[SPEAKER_10]: Red Bull gives you wings because it makes you freaking high.

01:15:38.346 --> 01:15:39.026
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, exactly.

01:15:39.487 --> 01:15:39.807
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

01:15:41.400 --> 01:15:44.203
[SPEAKER_07]: So anything you want to share about what you've been hearing on the show so far?

01:15:44.264 --> 01:15:45.866
[SPEAKER_07]: Anything going on in your video game world?

01:15:52.848 --> 01:15:54.188
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah, the Katamari cake.

01:15:54.308 --> 01:15:58.850
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, what is up with all these cakes you guys are looking at tonight in chat?

01:15:59.070 --> 01:16:06.451
[SPEAKER_07]: So there was the cake with the giant penis on it, and now there's the cake that's a Katamari, the little prince of the cosmos pushing around the Katamari.

01:16:06.471 --> 01:16:06.871
[SPEAKER_07]: That's awesome.

01:16:06.891 --> 01:16:08.312
[SPEAKER_10]: I want a cake like that for my birthday.

01:16:09.172 --> 01:16:11.313
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, like two years ago I had a Kirby cake.

01:16:13.393 --> 01:16:14.673
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's so cute.

01:16:14.813 --> 01:16:16.194
[SPEAKER_07]: What was Kirby doing on the Kirby cake?

01:16:17.194 --> 01:16:19.115
[SPEAKER_11]: He was just kind of being there.

01:16:19.415 --> 01:16:20.955
[SPEAKER_07]: Just chilling out, saying, hey, I'm a cake.

01:16:21.693 --> 01:16:22.254
[SPEAKER_11]: In the fridge.

01:16:22.614 --> 01:16:26.577
[SPEAKER_11]: And I couldn't look in the fridge for like two days because it was supposed to be a surprise.

01:16:26.858 --> 01:16:27.198
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

01:16:28.880 --> 01:16:37.007
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, so I would be like making eggs and I'd have to shut my eyes and I'd end up like sticking my hand in mashed potatoes or something.

01:16:37.047 --> 01:16:38.628
[SPEAKER_07]: What flavor was Kirby when you ate him?

01:16:39.949 --> 01:16:40.390
[SPEAKER_11]: Strawberry.

01:16:41.050 --> 01:16:41.371
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

01:16:41.991 --> 01:16:43.012
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a very Kirby flavor.

01:16:43.212 --> 01:16:44.453
[SPEAKER_11]: Kirby is strawberry.

01:16:45.274 --> 01:16:45.715
[SPEAKER_07]: Delicious.

01:16:46.516 --> 01:16:52.221
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Roz, we're going to go ahead and let you go so we can get to another caller, but thanks so much for calling in and sharing the Kirby cake love with us.

01:16:52.521 --> 01:16:56.064
[SPEAKER_07]: And enjoy that Red Bull, but please, don't drink and drive, alright?

01:16:57.125 --> 01:16:57.465
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

01:16:57.565 --> 01:16:58.466
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, have a good one.

01:16:59.407 --> 01:16:59.707
[SPEAKER_11]: Bye.

01:16:59.767 --> 01:17:01.368
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I also want to say, Roz, Roz, wait.

01:17:01.388 --> 01:17:03.090
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually talked while the girl was here.

01:17:03.931 --> 01:17:05.812
[SPEAKER_07]: Roz, I just want to say real quick, one more thing.

01:17:07.133 --> 01:17:08.955
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you drink liquor at all, ever?

01:17:11.324 --> 01:17:16.688
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to be responsible for starting someone's drinking career, so stay away from the absolute for tonight.

01:17:40.879 --> 01:17:46.509
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go to another call Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio Hey Hey, who's this?

01:17:47.351 --> 01:17:51.758
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Xander from Florida again Hi, Xander from Florida Aren't you one of our listeners who's shut out right now?

01:17:53.240 --> 01:17:53.480
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

01:17:53.880 --> 01:17:56.321
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I'm so sorry to hear it, but I don't know what to tell you.

01:17:56.361 --> 01:17:57.361
[SPEAKER_07]: This is crazy.

01:17:57.461 --> 01:17:59.161
[SPEAKER_07]: I've never seen this happen on Orange Lounge.

01:18:00.382 --> 01:18:04.023
[SPEAKER_07]: Did somebody hear that we were giving away a million dollars or something?

01:18:04.263 --> 01:18:04.863
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know why.

01:18:04.883 --> 01:18:06.243
[SPEAKER_10]: They knew that I was back.

01:18:06.683 --> 01:18:10.744
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I've been telling people again to listen, so I don't know.

01:18:10.784 --> 01:18:11.485
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe that's the problem.

01:18:11.705 --> 01:18:13.305
[SPEAKER_07]: No, we're going to do something about it.

01:18:13.345 --> 01:18:16.546
[SPEAKER_07]: We're just going to have to pony up the extra money to double our cap, but...

01:18:17.765 --> 01:18:20.707
[SPEAKER_07]: That will involve probably all of us having to get a second job.

01:18:20.847 --> 01:18:21.948
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm kidding.

01:18:22.728 --> 01:18:23.689
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to do something about it.

01:18:23.709 --> 01:18:25.790
[SPEAKER_07]: We just can't do it tonight, so to speak.

01:18:25.830 --> 01:18:27.211
[SPEAKER_07]: So you guys are kind of locked out tonight.

01:18:27.271 --> 01:18:30.493
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're just surprised because we have not been in danger of hitting our cap.

01:18:30.993 --> 01:18:36.697
[SPEAKER_07]: But little known fact, or maybe not so little, but our podcast was actually featured on Yahoo this week.

01:18:37.117 --> 01:18:43.641
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think because of that, if you go to podcast.yahoo.com, you see a little picture of our podcast.

01:18:43.921 --> 01:18:44.642
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think...

01:18:45.362 --> 01:18:50.525
[SPEAKER_07]: That in turn created more podcast downloads, which in turn have created more show listeners.

01:18:51.605 --> 01:18:57.048
[SPEAKER_07]: We're very happy that folks are tuning in to listen to the madness, but it's kind of crazy at the same time.

01:18:59.093 --> 01:19:02.015
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Xander, since you're not able to listen to the show, is there anything you want to tell our listeners?

01:19:05.036 --> 01:19:07.318
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I can't think of anything right now.

01:19:07.638 --> 01:19:08.778
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

01:19:08.798 --> 01:19:10.199
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I had something before.

01:19:10.700 --> 01:19:12.420
[SPEAKER_02]: I always lose it whenever I call you guys.

01:19:12.541 --> 01:19:15.322
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the pressures of being on air that make you forget things, huh?

01:19:15.422 --> 01:19:16.283
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

01:19:16.303 --> 01:19:21.345
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you ever wonder why we don't ever talk about video games on the live show, it's the pressures of being on air.

01:19:21.806 --> 01:19:23.006
[SPEAKER_07]: We completely forget about games.

01:19:23.627 --> 01:19:23.807
[SPEAKER_07]: We do.

01:19:25.455 --> 01:19:26.596
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, Xander, well, thanks for the call.

01:19:26.636 --> 01:19:27.356
[SPEAKER_07]: Have a good one, okay?

01:19:27.416 --> 01:19:28.056
[SPEAKER_07]: And I hope you get in.

01:19:28.316 --> 01:19:28.657
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

01:19:28.977 --> 01:19:29.657
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, keep trying.

01:19:30.197 --> 01:19:30.418
[SPEAKER_07]: Later.

01:19:32.399 --> 01:19:33.599
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, thank you, Xander, for calling.

01:19:33.819 --> 01:19:37.881
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, we're actually going to shut off the Skyplane just for a little bit and go to an actual break.

01:19:37.901 --> 01:19:45.605
[SPEAKER_07]: We are going to come back, so if you haven't gotten through just yet, don't cry and scream just yet, because we are going to take some more calls a little later in the show, I promise.

01:19:46.166 --> 01:19:48.487
[SPEAKER_07]: But I really have to pee, so that means we take a break.

01:19:49.147 --> 01:19:49.527
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

01:19:49.747 --> 01:19:50.788
[SPEAKER_07]: That's just how it is, guys.

01:19:50.828 --> 01:19:52.709
[SPEAKER_07]: When I've got to go potty, we go to a break.

01:19:54.980 --> 01:19:58.402
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're going to go to break and we're going to come back with more Orange Lounge Radio.

01:19:59.123 --> 01:20:00.224
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think we'll start off this break.

01:20:00.244 --> 01:20:01.385
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll do some DDR music.

01:20:02.185 --> 01:20:04.107
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you want to do Rock Lobster?

01:20:04.147 --> 01:20:05.147
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have Rock Lobster.

01:20:05.227 --> 01:20:07.069
[SPEAKER_07]: I have Rome and I have Love Shack.

01:20:07.089 --> 01:20:07.909
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have Rock Lobster.

01:20:07.929 --> 01:20:09.350
[SPEAKER_10]: How can you not have Rock Lobster?

01:20:09.390 --> 01:20:09.831
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

01:20:09.991 --> 01:20:11.952
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I'll get it for later.

01:20:12.753 --> 01:20:14.554
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, we're going to do some DDR music in this break.

01:20:16.656 --> 01:20:20.919
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yes, Dark Sakura wanted to hear some You're Not Here, which was a song in DDR.

01:20:20.939 --> 01:20:24.021
[SPEAKER_10]: That's one of the songs that I built out in my car when no one's in there with me.

01:20:25.206 --> 01:20:27.068
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to hear your lovely singing voice sometime.

01:20:28.169 --> 01:20:29.310
[SPEAKER_10]: You won't because I don't have one.

01:20:32.113 --> 01:20:32.613
[SPEAKER_07]: Fine.

01:20:32.813 --> 01:20:38.659
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio and your calls.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:40.841
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, we'll get the Mflow.

01:20:40.941 --> 01:20:44.264
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't have Mirrorball Satellite.

01:20:45.345 --> 01:20:47.587
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll play Mflow from Third Style and they'll like it.

01:20:49.755 --> 01:20:50.637
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll be back after this.

01:21:23.148 --> 01:21:26.936
[SPEAKER_17]: We risk our dreams forever, the raindrops blowin' the wind, it's deadly

01:21:33.254 --> 01:21:34.495
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you for watching!

01:21:56.040 --> 01:22:16.307
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm strung out, addicted to you, my body aches, now that you're gone My supplies fell through, you let me give me everything you had and more You craved my happiness, when you made me feel joy in me, just smile for now

01:22:21.857 --> 01:22:22.858
Thank you for watching!

Turn around, look at what you see

01:25:52.371 --> 01:25:57.158
[SPEAKER_17]: Love or truth, this is what I prove, between me and you.

01:25:57.198 --> 01:26:00.022
[SPEAKER_17]: Love or truth, whichever you choose, is for me.

01:27:20.232 --> 01:27:20.693
[SPEAKER_20]: I got a beat.

01:27:47.780 --> 01:27:50.742
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, so typically this is the part of the show where we'd come back on air.

01:27:50.782 --> 01:27:55.445
[SPEAKER_07]: However, due to popular demand from our chatroom, we are going to do one more song.

01:27:55.565 --> 01:27:58.466
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's a brand new song from DDR Ultramix 3.

01:27:59.307 --> 01:28:01.728
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to play this full song because it just rocks that much.

01:28:02.248 --> 01:28:02.569
[SPEAKER_07]: Enjoy.

01:28:02.589 --> 01:28:06.391
[SPEAKER_07]: It has a quiet opening, but trust me, the song's playing.

01:28:12.975 --> 01:28:13.295
Ultramix 3

01:28:21.524 --> 01:28:22.250
Thanks for watching!

01:28:35.842 --> 01:28:56.284

01:28:57.884 --> 01:28:58.585
[SPEAKER_18]: I can't say.

01:28:58.885 --> 01:29:00.745
[SPEAKER_18]: People just liked it better that way.

01:29:00.946 --> 01:29:02.826
[SPEAKER_18]: So, take me back to Constantinople.

01:29:02.866 --> 01:29:04.987
[SPEAKER_18]: No, you can't go back to Constantinople.

[SPEAKER_18]: Been a long time gone.

01:29:06.207 --> 01:29:08.688
[SPEAKER_18]: Constantinople, why did Constantinople get the works?

01:29:09.208 --> 01:29:12.610
[SPEAKER_18]: That's nobody's business but the Turks.

Istanbul.

01:30:33.612 --> 01:30:39.536
[SPEAKER_07]: We're back here on Orange Lounge Radio, that was a little bit of Istanbul, not Constantinople, but they might be giants.

01:30:40.436 --> 01:30:46.020
[SPEAKER_07]: That mp3 file was a little quiet, sorry guys, I had to turn that up in the middle there, and sorry for the volume.

01:30:47.161 --> 01:30:51.143
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, we're back here on Orange Lounge Radio, and we've been talking about Ultramix 3 a little bit.

01:30:51.183 --> 01:30:58.168
[SPEAKER_07]: We were taking some calls over Skype, and I do want to take some more calls over Skype very shortly, and get to the cage match as well, we got that to worry about.

01:30:58.188 --> 01:30:59.609
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, what's up, what's on your mind?

01:31:00.228 --> 01:31:00.528
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing.

01:31:00.588 --> 01:31:04.970
[SPEAKER_04]: I figure I'll save it for after the KH match in my normal segment, which I cover the sim news.

01:31:05.870 --> 01:31:07.191
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there actually going to be sim news tonight?

01:31:07.251 --> 01:31:08.051
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course!

01:31:09.672 --> 01:31:12.373
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you know that DDR Mania X actually came back?

01:31:12.533 --> 01:31:12.913
[SPEAKER_07]: Did they?

01:31:13.413 --> 01:31:14.154
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't know that.

01:31:14.314 --> 01:31:15.895
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently they've been up for a while now.

01:31:15.915 --> 01:31:17.775
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I have a confession to make?

01:31:18.516 --> 01:31:19.316
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, no.

01:31:19.376 --> 01:31:21.277
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to offend anybody when I say this.

01:31:22.202 --> 01:31:25.383
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't really visit any Bomani sites besides DDR Freakin' Orange Lounge.

01:31:25.723 --> 01:31:26.323
[SPEAKER_07]: I really don't.

01:31:26.943 --> 01:31:37.005
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Bomani style, once in a great while, I kind of lurk just to kind of see what the goings-ons are, and I think I've done the same on Air in Japan, but on a regular basis, I only visit DDR Freakin' Orange Lounge.

01:31:37.425 --> 01:31:38.585
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't really surf the other sites.

01:31:39.426 --> 01:31:42.366
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's not that they're bad sites, it's just I don't have time.

01:31:42.766 --> 01:31:43.286
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, it is.

01:31:43.406 --> 01:31:45.067
[SPEAKER_07]: We will have... No, it's not.

01:31:45.307 --> 01:31:50.228
[SPEAKER_04]: We will have, hopefully, if everything works out, and I will go into this later...

01:31:52.433 --> 01:31:55.018
[SPEAKER_04]: We will have more stuff in our download section for our PSP site.

01:31:55.418 --> 01:31:57.502
[SPEAKER_04]: Stuff that's related to the show.

01:31:58.363 --> 01:31:59.926
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be awesome.

01:32:01.548 --> 01:32:04.593
[SPEAKER_04]: Because this hasn't been posted anywhere except for Japanese sites.

01:32:06.960 --> 01:32:07.020
[SPEAKER_07]: D.R.

01:32:07.080 --> 01:32:07.180
[SPEAKER_07]: ANGEL

01:32:28.454 --> 01:32:31.676
[SPEAKER_07]: Your Mama Joke of the Week Today's haiku is a summarization of Gulliver's Fowls by Jonathan Swift.

01:32:31.696 --> 01:32:34.278
[SPEAKER_07]: The size was first great, then small, and much vexed to learn, but the size does matter.

01:32:34.298 --> 01:32:34.638
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

01:32:34.658 --> 01:32:34.879
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

01:32:58.391 --> 01:33:02.293
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, if you ever run out of advice columns, you should just have the haiku of the week on the podcast.

01:33:03.613 --> 01:33:04.294
[SPEAKER_10]: The Kama Sutra.

01:33:05.354 --> 01:33:07.535
[SPEAKER_10]: Advice for those in a difficult position.

01:33:07.715 --> 01:33:09.156
[SPEAKER_10]: First, be flexible.

01:33:14.818 --> 01:33:20.880
[SPEAKER_07]: Speaking of the Kama Sutra, let's talk about the Burning Crusade, things you don't want after practicing the Kama Sutra.

01:33:21.180 --> 01:33:22.421
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't want a Burning Crusade.

01:33:23.439 --> 01:33:26.000
[SPEAKER_07]: Angel, you're one of our resident World of Warcraft whores.

01:33:26.240 --> 01:33:27.701
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's got the highest level?

01:33:27.741 --> 01:33:28.341
[SPEAKER_07]: What's your highest level?

01:33:28.361 --> 01:33:28.561
[SPEAKER_07]: Me.

01:33:28.901 --> 01:33:29.502
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura?

01:33:29.522 --> 01:33:30.182
[SPEAKER_07]: Seven.

01:33:30.382 --> 01:33:31.683
[SPEAKER_07]: And Loki, you don't play that bullshit.

01:33:31.783 --> 01:33:34.564
[SPEAKER_07]: My highest level is 16, so what's yours?

01:33:34.624 --> 01:33:36.245
[SPEAKER_10]: Currently, mine's 43.

01:33:36.885 --> 01:33:38.646
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, you're the official WoW whore.

01:33:38.666 --> 01:33:40.927
[SPEAKER_07]: So what's going on in the World of WoW?

01:33:42.187 --> 01:33:45.168
[SPEAKER_07]: First off, your hair looks good, though, DarkSakura.

01:33:45.308 --> 01:33:45.669
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks good.

01:33:45.829 --> 01:33:46.529
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks pink.

01:33:47.089 --> 01:33:47.569
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks good.

01:33:47.609 --> 01:33:48.410
[SPEAKER_07]: I like the color.

01:33:48.670 --> 01:33:49.890
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, anyway, so...

01:33:51.687 --> 01:34:01.594
[SPEAKER_07]: BlizzCon was this past weekend, and I would have gone had I had more interest a couple months ago in what Blizzard was doing, but I kind of ignored World of Warcraft for a long, long time.

01:34:02.355 --> 01:34:02.815
[SPEAKER_07]: You all know.

01:34:03.295 --> 01:34:06.297
[SPEAKER_07]: And I never really got into Warcraft 3 or Warcraft 2.

01:34:07.098 --> 01:34:10.500
[SPEAKER_07]: I played a lot of Warcraft 2, actually, but I was really fucking bad at it.

01:34:10.560 --> 01:34:14.023
[SPEAKER_07]: When I say really fucking bad, I mean really fucking bad at Warcraft.

01:34:14.103 --> 01:34:16.565
[SPEAKER_07]: I did not have the brain capacity to handle so many things going on at once.

01:34:17.406 --> 01:34:19.147
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, World of Warcraft is not a problem for me.

01:34:19.408 --> 01:34:20.028
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, man.

01:34:20.889 --> 01:34:22.010
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't even explain it.

01:34:22.230 --> 01:34:31.157
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I know there's a lot out there, you know, City of Heroes and now soon City of Villains and Final Fantasy XI and just, you know, there's a lot out there.

01:34:31.177 --> 01:34:33.119
[SPEAKER_10]: EQ too, yeah.

01:34:34.220 --> 01:34:40.425
[SPEAKER_10]: But World of Warcraft for me, wow, it's just, no pun intended.

01:34:40.565 --> 01:34:41.446
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, all right.

01:34:41.826 --> 01:34:42.186
[SPEAKER_07]: That's cool.

01:34:42.447 --> 01:34:42.847
[SPEAKER_07]: So what's up?

01:34:42.887 --> 01:34:44.128
[SPEAKER_07]: What's going to happen with this new expansion?

01:34:44.368 --> 01:34:45.369
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, so much.

01:34:46.790 --> 01:34:53.716
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to have what's called rideable mounts, which currently they have mounts for each race.

01:34:54.837 --> 01:35:09.089
[SPEAKER_10]: When you hit 40, you can save up all your money and go train on riding and then go get your mount so that you can be all cool and ride all fast around the lands rather than walking because, well, we all know walking sucks.

01:35:09.149 --> 01:35:10.010
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, walking sucks.

01:35:10.350 --> 01:35:12.231
[SPEAKER_07]: and flying those birds takes forever sometimes.

01:35:12.271 --> 01:35:16.453
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, flying those birds can take forever and they can be expensive depending on where you need to go.

01:35:16.613 --> 01:35:18.653
[SPEAKER_10]: So, that's cool.

01:35:18.693 --> 01:35:22.195
[SPEAKER_10]: They're going to have flyable mounts now in the new expansion.

01:35:23.015 --> 01:35:27.897
[SPEAKER_10]: There's also going to be a lot of areas you need to explore and stuff like that.

01:35:29.458 --> 01:35:37.261
[SPEAKER_10]: They're raising the level cap from 60 to 70 which will enable us to go beyond the Dark Portal.

01:35:38.402 --> 01:35:39.262
[SPEAKER_10]: If you guys remember

01:35:41.344 --> 01:35:46.270
[SPEAKER_10]: Warcraft 2 expansion, Beyond the Dark Portal, and then Warcraft 3.

01:35:46.910 --> 01:35:56.842
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're going to be able to go through the portal, and I believe one of the things that you can do when you go Beyond the Dark Portal...

01:35:57.882 --> 01:35:59.822
[SPEAKER_10]: New Race for the Horde is Blood Elves

01:36:26.915 --> 01:36:37.539
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, I do not know what the Alliance is going to get, but, ah, well, it's rumored it's going to be Pandarian, so, or Pandaren, no, Pandaren, that's it.

01:36:38.359 --> 01:36:46.102
[SPEAKER_10]: But, yeah, so, um, yeah, I don't know, am I forgetting something, Mr. Robb?

01:36:47.444 --> 01:36:52.007
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you hit on most of the big points about what's going on with the expansion.

01:36:53.027 --> 01:36:56.069
[SPEAKER_07]: The rumored Pandarian would be so cool if that really happens.

01:36:57.370 --> 01:36:58.831
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you hit on most of the other big stuff.

01:36:59.411 --> 01:37:04.214
[SPEAKER_07]: There's going to be a new profession, like alchemy and stuff, to go along with the socketed items.

01:37:04.234 --> 01:37:06.655
[SPEAKER_07]: You could be a jewel master.

01:37:08.336 --> 01:37:09.997
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I can't really think of anything else.

01:37:10.297 --> 01:37:14.960
[SPEAKER_10]: I probably did forget something or whatever along the way, but

01:37:15.441 --> 01:37:15.741
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.com

01:37:33.676 --> 01:37:36.937
[SPEAKER_10]: heavily, heavily into World of Warcraft, and that's all they do on the station.

01:37:36.957 --> 01:37:37.897
[SPEAKER_07]: You can plug them, I don't care.

01:37:38.357 --> 01:37:39.757
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, wcradio.com.

01:37:39.897 --> 01:37:40.257
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

01:37:41.037 --> 01:37:41.638
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you know that.

01:37:41.658 --> 01:37:43.538
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm all about supporting the independent radio.

01:37:43.658 --> 01:37:49.059
[SPEAKER_07]: I just don't want you coming on here and plugging, you know, 97.1 to hit, say FM, you know, fuck them.

01:37:49.599 --> 01:37:52.320
[SPEAKER_10]: No, my number one will always be Orange Hill Radio.

01:37:52.360 --> 01:37:52.940
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you're sweet.

01:37:53.060 --> 01:37:53.300
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

01:37:54.320 --> 01:37:57.861
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, so, I don't know, I think I pretty much hit everything.

01:37:58.521 --> 01:37:59.301
[SPEAKER_10]: New instances in...

01:37:59.972 --> 01:38:00.713
[SPEAKER_10]: All that stuff, too.

01:38:00.833 --> 01:38:02.754
[SPEAKER_10]: So, hey, there's a lot to look forward to.

01:38:02.854 --> 01:38:03.375
[SPEAKER_07]: Good times.

01:38:03.775 --> 01:38:04.416
[SPEAKER_07]: Looking forward to it.

01:38:04.876 --> 01:38:05.256
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

01:38:05.637 --> 01:38:08.379
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to go back over to the Skype line and take some of your calls.

01:38:08.419 --> 01:38:16.866
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you do want to call into the show, you can do that by going over to our Skype line at www.OrangeLoungeRadio.com and clicking on Interact With Us for more information.

01:38:17.246 --> 01:38:23.131
[SPEAKER_07]: Or you can always call us the old-fashioned way, and that is via the telephone, 916-226-9067.

01:38:23.491 --> 01:38:24.492
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go to our first call.

01:38:24.532 --> 01:38:25.653
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:38:26.908 --> 01:38:28.292
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, Sephiroth1215.

01:38:28.572 --> 01:38:30.358
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, Sephiroth1215, what's on your mind?

01:38:32.423 --> 01:38:33.928
[SPEAKER_12]: Actually, a lot of stuff today.

01:38:34.963 --> 01:38:45.727
[SPEAKER_12]: First of all, to start off, I'll say the Ultramix 3 list so far sounds pretty interesting, and it just sounds like they give Konami of Hawaii a big budget now.

01:38:46.627 --> 01:38:55.070
[SPEAKER_07]: It is kind of weird, like, all these songs from so many random different places, but I don't know, I strangely dig it.

01:38:55.090 --> 01:38:56.771
[SPEAKER_07]: There really is something for everyone.

01:38:56.871 --> 01:38:59.392
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I know they've said that about previous DDR mixes,

01:39:00.212 --> 01:39:14.184
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, there's something for everyone, but no, seriously guys, this time, something for everyone, like even like Ray Charles, no FX, come on, that's tapping into audiences that never would have looked twice at DDR before, so that's something else.

01:39:16.098 --> 01:39:22.444
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, but otherwise, something you haven't really talked about is the recent release of DDR Mario Mix here.

01:39:24.086 --> 01:39:30.672
[SPEAKER_07]: I kind of glossed over DDR Mario Mix because I haven't picked up my copy yet, because I bought Soul Calibur III instead this week.

01:39:32.794 --> 01:39:35.176
[SPEAKER_07]: which should show you where I'm at DDR-wise.

01:39:35.276 --> 01:39:40.521
[SPEAKER_07]: Plus, you know, I just, it doesn't seem like something that's that difficult, but I don't know.

01:39:40.541 --> 01:39:40.961
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you think?

01:39:41.001 --> 01:39:41.582
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you pick it up?

01:39:43.463 --> 01:39:46.726
[SPEAKER_12]: Technically, I did, but I got it for free.

01:39:47.186 --> 01:39:47.787
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, okay.

01:39:47.947 --> 01:39:49.708
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, did you, like, win one of those tournaments or something?

01:39:51.010 --> 01:39:54.112
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, only three people showed up, and two of which were my friends.

01:39:54.613 --> 01:39:55.193
[SPEAKER_07]: Good job.

01:39:55.273 --> 01:39:55.954
[SPEAKER_07]: Good job, anyway.

01:39:57.358 --> 01:40:02.223
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, so I just got it for free, and I unlocked pretty much everything just last night.

01:40:02.743 --> 01:40:03.724
[SPEAKER_07]: Was there anything really cool?

01:40:05.025 --> 01:40:09.029
[SPEAKER_07]: Or was it all Mario stuff and classical tunes being redone?

01:40:09.810 --> 01:40:11.231
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it's okay.

01:40:11.331 --> 01:40:12.412
[SPEAKER_12]: The song's okay.

01:40:13.233 --> 01:40:20.399
[SPEAKER_12]: What I think is interesting is the way they did it, of how it's just like a Mario game where you go through different worlds and go through the levels in the worlds.

01:40:21.260 --> 01:40:21.620
[SPEAKER_12]: Really?

01:40:21.640 --> 01:40:21.861
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

01:40:24.878 --> 01:40:29.863
[SPEAKER_12]: But otherwise, I think it's really good that I got it for free.

01:40:30.163 --> 01:40:33.286
[SPEAKER_12]: Because I wouldn't really pay for it unless it was maybe cheaper.

01:40:34.827 --> 01:40:36.649
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's a little too much money for me right now, too.

01:40:36.669 --> 01:40:38.811
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't they want like 60 bucks for it with the pad and everything?

01:40:39.631 --> 01:40:42.953
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, but I actually think that soft pad is really nice.

01:40:43.313 --> 01:40:45.495
[SPEAKER_12]: It has more padding in the middle.

01:40:46.736 --> 01:40:59.684
[SPEAKER_07]: The pads have been getting progressively nicer through various CDR mixes, because we had the original one, which is okay, and there was actually the old, old Konami mat for the Dreamcast that had that funny layer of plastic over the mat.

01:41:00.104 --> 01:41:01.285
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, you had these mats.

01:41:01.305 --> 01:41:02.906
[SPEAKER_07]: They were like some of the first mats I ever played on.

01:41:03.206 --> 01:41:08.268
[SPEAKER_10]: I had the Dreamcast ones that were the triple sticky thing, and now they slide apart.

01:41:10.069 --> 01:41:11.850
[SPEAKER_10]: They're not as good as one thinks they are.

01:41:12.670 --> 01:41:15.611
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the Xbox ones were really good, and now the GameCube ones.

01:41:15.631 --> 01:41:17.112
[SPEAKER_07]: So they've had a lot of time to get it right.

01:41:19.573 --> 01:41:23.834
[SPEAKER_12]: So far I think those are the best softpads, but I have a metal pad anyway, so whatever.

01:41:25.055 --> 01:41:27.636
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you think there's enough here for DDR fans to be happy?

01:41:29.537 --> 01:41:29.657
[SPEAKER_12]: Um...

01:41:32.096 --> 01:41:35.358
[SPEAKER_12]: Mario Mix is one of those games that's going to be more for kids.

01:42:01.618 --> 01:42:05.301
[SPEAKER_07]: People that just are obsessed with Nintendo, like Ultimate Nintendo Fanboys and stuff.

01:42:06.361 --> 01:42:12.386
[SPEAKER_07]: Or, you know, people that like the GameCube, or only have a GameCube, or like the GameCube things.

01:42:12.706 --> 01:42:15.628
[SPEAKER_07]: I think most of the hardcore DDR people are going to find their game somewhere else.

01:42:16.589 --> 01:42:20.171
[SPEAKER_12]: It's definitely a good mix to start out with for somebody who hasn't played yet, though.

01:42:20.332 --> 01:42:20.852
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's cool.

01:42:21.092 --> 01:42:21.793
[SPEAKER_12]: It's definitely good.

01:42:22.113 --> 01:42:22.753
[SPEAKER_07]: They need that, too.

01:42:24.174 --> 01:42:28.938
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, well, Sephiroth1215, I'll let you have your final words, then we're going to let you go and try to get another call.

01:42:30.374 --> 01:42:43.720
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, last thing I wanted to say, which I can't confirm or anything, I just heard around, is that the Xbox 360 is, you can't get the premiums in first-come, first-served stores.

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:49.143
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope that's a lot of bullshit, because if it is not bullshit and that leads out to be true, I'm going to be one pissed motherfucker.

01:42:49.503 --> 01:42:51.024
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to be one pissed motherfucker.

01:42:51.064 --> 01:42:55.926
[SPEAKER_07]: I should not have to reserve that crap without them telling me.

01:42:57.959 --> 01:42:59.264
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't be sure of that though.

01:42:59.304 --> 01:43:00.228
[SPEAKER_07]: Where did you hear it though?

01:43:00.268 --> 01:43:02.356
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you hear it at a store that does reservations?

01:43:03.690 --> 01:43:08.433
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, yeah, first, I heard it online in GameFAQs, which I'm like, whatever, I don't really believe you.

01:43:08.513 --> 01:43:17.979
[SPEAKER_12]: Then I went to a store, and they said, yeah, we're not allowed to take any cores, because they're sending all the cores out to the stores, and we're getting all the premiums to try and get all the pre-orders up.

01:43:18.900 --> 01:43:21.261
[SPEAKER_07]: I have this weird feeling, I hope it's not true, or I'm gonna be pissed.

01:43:21.561 --> 01:43:26.244
[SPEAKER_07]: I cannot imagine a huge chain like Best Buy, that they would screw over somebody like Best Buy or Toys R Us with that.

01:43:26.825 --> 01:43:26.965
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

01:43:28.215 --> 01:43:31.798
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, maybe we'll call Microsoft on the podcast or something.

01:43:32.038 --> 01:43:36.061
[SPEAKER_07]: If it wasn't so late on a Sunday night they were open, I swear we'd call somebody and try to figure it out.

01:43:36.762 --> 01:43:39.764
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a feeling it's false, but we'll see.

01:43:39.824 --> 01:43:41.645
[SPEAKER_07]: If it does turn out to be true, I'm going to be pissed.

01:43:43.547 --> 01:43:48.110
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, you can still reserve it, but I don't think you're guaranteed it until next year sometime.

01:43:49.311 --> 01:43:49.831
[SPEAKER_07]: What a crap.

01:43:50.112 --> 01:43:50.692
[SPEAKER_07]: What a bunch of crap.

01:43:51.333 --> 01:43:53.054
[SPEAKER_07]: I will get one launch day, just you wait.

01:43:55.075 --> 01:43:56.256
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, Zaku, what's on your mind?

01:44:21.284 --> 01:44:26.167
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm posting up a link right now that pretty much might be of your interest.

01:44:26.647 --> 01:44:31.510
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you might hate it, some of you might say, what the fuck am I doing, but here we go.

01:44:32.470 --> 01:44:37.473
[SPEAKER_00]: It's from CDR Freaks New York forums, but I think you'll see what I'm trying to tell you.

01:44:37.733 --> 01:44:40.675
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so give us a description of it while it loads on the computers here.

01:44:42.116 --> 01:44:46.018
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, basically, MTV wants New York City DDR players.

01:44:46.690 --> 01:44:53.896
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't know why, but this dude who was probably recruited by them is seeking our kind.

01:44:55.317 --> 01:44:58.500
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so if you live in the New York area, let's see.

01:45:00.922 --> 01:45:05.185
[SPEAKER_07]: As you can see in the thread, I've already signed up as well as several other prominent players.

01:45:05.225 --> 01:45:05.725
[SPEAKER_07]: They basically...

01:45:30.410 --> 01:45:37.433
[SPEAKER_00]: They already called me back that same day, and MTV is supposed to be calling me soon about the interview date.

01:45:38.173 --> 01:45:38.473
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

01:45:38.493 --> 01:45:40.154
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll drop our name a whole bunch, all right?

01:45:42.215 --> 01:45:42.715
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see.

01:45:42.895 --> 01:45:43.715
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just messing with you.

01:45:43.755 --> 01:45:44.395
[SPEAKER_07]: Have fun with it.

01:45:44.435 --> 01:45:44.936
[SPEAKER_07]: Have fun with it.

01:45:44.956 --> 01:45:45.556
[SPEAKER_07]: That's great news.

01:45:47.056 --> 01:45:51.838
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's basically what they want.

01:45:51.878 --> 01:45:58.941
[SPEAKER_00]: They want sociable and outgoing people to just break that stereotype, which is basically what we are in a nutshell.

01:45:59.952 --> 01:46:01.053
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, well, yeah.

01:46:02.613 --> 01:46:08.076
[SPEAKER_00]: And as far as Ultramix 3 songs go, freestylers are fine.

01:46:08.996 --> 01:46:09.977
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all you need to know.

01:46:10.037 --> 01:46:24.164
[SPEAKER_00]: If we were able, you know, a couple of weeks ago to hook up a PS2 to a DDR machine and use it as such, we could probably do the same thing for an Xbox and whore out the songs for freestyle routines.

01:46:24.244 --> 01:46:26.025
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, it's going to be great for freestyle people.

01:46:26.305 --> 01:46:28.386
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's got such a solid song list.

01:46:29.413 --> 01:46:34.217
[SPEAKER_00]: If we could get it, that's if we could, you know, hook up an Xbox to a DDR machine in about a year.

01:46:34.477 --> 01:46:35.098
[SPEAKER_00]: You never know.

01:46:35.759 --> 01:46:36.239
[SPEAKER_07]: You never know.

01:46:38.100 --> 01:46:38.341
[SPEAKER_00]: Mm-hmm.

01:46:38.441 --> 01:46:39.181
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, okay.

01:46:39.261 --> 01:46:40.642
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, good luck with the MTV thing.

01:46:40.662 --> 01:46:43.645
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, I don't really watch MTV, but I'll make an exception.

01:46:43.705 --> 01:46:46.567
[SPEAKER_07]: If you get on it, I'll TiVo it or something.

01:46:47.768 --> 01:46:49.450
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I just hope I get in.

01:46:50.130 --> 01:46:50.851
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

01:46:51.531 --> 01:46:55.915
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's probably in a few weeks anyway, so... As I said...

01:46:56.556 --> 01:46:58.477
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch out, I might be on TV.

01:46:58.777 --> 01:46:59.197
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

01:46:59.417 --> 01:47:03.378
[SPEAKER_00]: If I am, just, you know, you'll probably mention it on Sunday.

01:47:04.498 --> 01:47:05.419
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe, we might.

01:47:05.559 --> 01:47:06.279
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm kidding, we would.

01:47:06.459 --> 01:47:06.739
[SPEAKER_07]: We would.

01:47:07.759 --> 01:47:10.680
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, good luck with that, and, you know, again, name drop a lot.

01:47:10.880 --> 01:47:11.860
[SPEAKER_07]: Orange Lounge, love it.

01:47:11.981 --> 01:47:12.481
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm just kidding.

01:47:13.101 --> 01:47:14.041
[SPEAKER_07]: Have a good one, alright?

01:47:15.542 --> 01:47:16.942
[SPEAKER_07]: I gotta let you go so we can get more calls.

01:47:18.260 --> 01:47:21.602
[SPEAKER_07]: Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match

01:47:49.551 --> 01:47:50.251
[SPEAKER_07]: www.orangeloungeradio.com

01:48:12.338 --> 01:48:16.102
[SPEAKER_07]: Song number one tonight is going for its fourth week win.

01:48:16.603 --> 01:48:19.866
[SPEAKER_07]: If it wins tonight, it will be retired.

01:48:19.906 --> 01:48:26.473
[SPEAKER_07]: It will be only the, I think, fifth song to be retired out of Orange Lounge Radio's cage match in the couple years we've been doing this.

01:48:27.114 --> 01:48:27.354
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

01:48:28.155 --> 01:48:29.535
[SPEAKER_07]: Here it is, it's song number four.

01:48:29.555 --> 01:48:31.376
[SPEAKER_07]: And it wasn't even really picked by one of us.

01:48:31.436 --> 01:48:34.797
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I put it in, but I put it in on behalf of Miklatov.

01:48:35.237 --> 01:48:37.457
[SPEAKER_07]: So, just kind of interesting the way that works out.

01:48:37.477 --> 01:48:41.678
[SPEAKER_07]: So this would be the first song that would get retired that was not even put in by one of us.

01:48:42.058 --> 01:48:43.759
[SPEAKER_07]: So it would be very interesting to see what happens.

01:48:44.079 --> 01:48:49.080
[SPEAKER_07]: So here it is, it's song number one, going for its fourth win in a row.

01:48:49.120 --> 01:48:50.060
[SPEAKER_07]: Will it be retired?

01:48:50.580 --> 01:48:51.161
[SPEAKER_07]: It's up to you.

01:48:51.301 --> 01:48:52.721
[SPEAKER_07]: Pendulum withholds your color.

01:51:05.232 --> 01:51:07.654
All right, let's get into song number two tonight.

01:51:07.694 --> 01:51:09.915
Song number two is Dark Sakura's pick.

01:51:09.935 --> 01:51:12.096
Dark Sakura, what did you pick for us?

01:51:12.157 --> 01:51:12.337
It's...

01:51:33.030 --> 01:51:33.870
[SPEAKER_07]: It's OG Bitch!

01:52:09.232 --> 01:52:10.533
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for watching!

01:55:11.289 --> 01:55:19.520
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, uttering her first words on the new microphone, DarkSakura will let us know how she liked OG Bitch.

01:55:19.980 --> 01:55:20.281
[SPEAKER_17]: Nine.

01:55:21.062 --> 01:55:22.844
[SPEAKER_07]: Get some nine from DarkSakura.

01:55:23.845 --> 01:55:24.786
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think it went through.

01:55:25.107 --> 01:55:26.529
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, give us a sentence.

01:55:27.765 --> 01:55:28.506
[SPEAKER_07]: I like burritos.

01:55:28.766 --> 01:55:29.286
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, that works.

01:55:29.306 --> 01:55:29.667
[SPEAKER_07]: There we go.

01:55:29.987 --> 01:55:30.347
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

01:55:31.008 --> 01:55:31.408
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki.

01:55:32.109 --> 01:55:33.970
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like burritos or that song.

01:55:34.871 --> 01:55:35.711
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a five.

01:55:36.172 --> 01:55:38.614
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like OG bitch.

01:55:39.855 --> 01:55:40.215
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

01:55:40.275 --> 01:55:43.358
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that like... It seems very Latin to me.

01:55:43.378 --> 01:55:45.399
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be original gangsta bitch, actually.

01:55:46.881 --> 01:55:47.361
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

01:55:47.501 --> 01:55:49.322
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't get it.

01:55:49.462 --> 01:55:51.504
[SPEAKER_07]: I kind of dug it because it had a cool beat to it.

01:55:51.544 --> 01:55:52.505
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I liked the remix.

01:55:52.905 --> 01:55:59.810
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not so sure I was up on the singing because the singing kind of had this kind of weird thing to it, but it was cool.

01:56:00.051 --> 01:56:02.833
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it was kind of... It's a song I could see myself getting down at the club.

01:56:03.633 --> 01:56:04.374
[SPEAKER_07]: OG clubbing.

01:56:05.054 --> 01:56:05.955
[SPEAKER_07]: So I give it an 8.

01:56:06.055 --> 01:56:06.936
[SPEAKER_07]: It was pretty good.

01:56:08.077 --> 01:56:09.038
[SPEAKER_08]: Extifer, what did you think?

01:56:10.579 --> 01:56:12.100
[SPEAKER_08]: She didn't sound like a gangsta.

01:56:13.061 --> 01:56:13.261
[SPEAKER_08]: But...

01:56:14.056 --> 01:56:17.179
[SPEAKER_08]: I will give it a five because I don't know what to think.

01:56:17.239 --> 01:56:18.640
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm purely in the middle on that one.

01:56:18.940 --> 01:56:19.360
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

01:56:19.761 --> 01:56:20.141
[SPEAKER_06]: Angel?

01:56:21.422 --> 01:56:22.943
[SPEAKER_10]: I liked the beat to it.

01:56:22.983 --> 01:56:23.744
[SPEAKER_10]: It was pretty neat.

01:56:23.944 --> 01:56:24.605
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, six.

01:56:25.605 --> 01:56:25.886
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

01:56:27.066 --> 01:56:33.031
[SPEAKER_07]: Song number three tonight, going up against Estro and Pendulum is... Loki, what'd you put in?

01:56:33.972 --> 01:56:38.035
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, this is just one of those weeks where I had nothing really to put in.

01:56:38.776 --> 01:56:42.679
[SPEAKER_04]: So, this song will go out to Captain Jack being dead and all, but, um,

01:56:43.032 --> 01:56:52.584
[SPEAKER_04]: This is actually, I think out of all the songs I've listened to him, this best sums up, you know, kind of the mood with him being, you know, dead and everything.

01:56:52.724 --> 01:56:54.906
[SPEAKER_04]: But, um, it's also really strange.

01:56:55.447 --> 01:56:56.468
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a really strange song.

01:56:56.488 --> 01:57:00.213
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm saying all those go to Pendulum because that's a fucking awesome song, but...

01:57:00.999 --> 01:57:01.399
[SPEAKER_04]: Here you go.

01:57:01.800 --> 01:57:02.480
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

01:57:02.500 --> 01:57:04.182
[SPEAKER_07]: You're going for the sympathy vote tonight.

01:57:04.322 --> 01:57:06.103
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not even hoping to get any votes.

01:57:06.183 --> 01:57:10.587
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, because the song I wanted to put in was too long and I didn't want to cut it down.

01:57:10.807 --> 01:57:12.048
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

01:57:12.248 --> 01:57:12.609
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

01:57:13.069 --> 01:57:14.030
[SPEAKER_07]: Song number three.

01:57:14.610 --> 01:57:15.511
[SPEAKER_07]: Going out to the man.

01:57:15.811 --> 01:57:16.452
[SPEAKER_07]: Captain Jack.

01:57:16.532 --> 01:57:18.413
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Captain Jack with Back Home.

01:57:18.673 --> 01:57:18.994
[SPEAKER_07]: Enjoy.

01:57:46.698 --> 01:57:59.504
[SPEAKER_17]: The captain wants to be back home And the captain fights against the storm He's always tuned against

01:58:00.151 --> 01:58:03.817
[SPEAKER_17]: He always wants to live and be back home

01:58:08.288 --> 01:58:28.183
[SPEAKER_14]: It was a lonely night with a pack full of dreams Miles away from home, I felt cold in the sea As if I was the only human being on Earth I thought about the soldiers and the peace camp there Couldn't stop thinking about my company About coming home, life and history How everything started with Captain Jack When will I meet you?

01:58:28.263 --> 01:58:29.504
[SPEAKER_14]: When will I be back?

01:58:29.924 --> 01:58:34.688
[SPEAKER_14]: Strike, try hard, give the best you can So never stop fighting for the peace in your land

01:58:35.308 --> 01:58:53.423
[SPEAKER_17]: Come together and see the light All for one, like a stick of dynamite The captain wants to be back home And the captain fights against the storm He's always true to the game He always wants to live and be back home

01:59:02.029 --> 01:59:07.274
[SPEAKER_14]: After hours and hours of marching through the land, there was something in the air held a flower in my hand.

01:59:07.554 --> 01:59:09.976
[SPEAKER_14]: The grass was green and the moon shined bright.

01:59:10.276 --> 01:59:12.498
[SPEAKER_14]: Remember that night when she held me tight.

01:59:12.819 --> 01:59:18.223
[SPEAKER_14]: I went down to the river with the water, but look, I was longing for my band and for the crazy couple.

01:59:18.323 --> 01:59:23.528
[SPEAKER_14]: When morning came and I reached the camp, I took a break and lay down in the warm white sand.

01:59:23.708 --> 01:59:25.870
[SPEAKER_14]: So try, try hard and give the best you can.

01:59:26.531 --> 01:59:43.491
[SPEAKER_17]: Never stop fighting for the peace in our land Come together and see the light All for one like a stick of dynamite The captain wants to be back home And the captain fights against the storm

01:59:56.038 --> 02:00:09.153
[SPEAKER_17]: The captain wants to be back home And the captain is feeling all alone He's always true to himself He always wants to live and be back home

02:00:17.683 --> 02:00:42.276
[SPEAKER_14]: Tak tak tak, never looking back Come and fight for Captain Jack Say it slow, but say it loud Join the peace camp and you'll be proud Jump and walk, train and talk Move your body, you're not a piece of chalk Scream and shout, call out my name It's Captain Jack, straight back again The captain wants to be back home

02:00:44.393 --> 02:01:08.908
[SPEAKER_17]: And the captain fights against the storm He's always true to game He always wants to live and be back home The captain wants to be back home And the captain is feeling all alone

02:01:15.430 --> 02:01:36.077
[SPEAKER_17]: The captain wants to live and be back home The captain wants to be back home And the captain fights against the storm He's always true to himself He always wants to live and be back home

02:01:43.763 --> 02:01:54.234
[SPEAKER_17]: The captain wants to be back home And the captain is feeling all alone He's always true to himself

02:02:41.468 --> 02:02:49.774
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, what did you think of that tribute that Loki picked there for Captain Jack?

02:02:49.934 --> 02:02:52.596
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm presently bleeding out of my ears from brain hemorrhage.

02:02:53.096 --> 02:02:54.898
[SPEAKER_07]: Careful, I think that's what Captain Jack died of.

02:02:55.938 --> 02:02:56.379
[SPEAKER_10]: I know.

02:02:56.999 --> 02:02:57.960
[SPEAKER_10]: This one gets a two.

02:02:57.980 --> 02:03:00.262
[SPEAKER_07]: A two from DarkSakura.

02:03:00.502 --> 02:03:00.882
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki!

02:03:02.904 --> 02:03:05.205
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I don't know, it just...

02:03:06.411 --> 02:03:07.211
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a weird song.

02:03:07.531 --> 02:03:13.893
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the song was okay until he started doing his rapping or whatever that is.

02:03:15.694 --> 02:03:19.735
[SPEAKER_04]: It gets like a 7 for the amount of days he's been dead.

02:03:21.095 --> 02:03:25.496
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, I have to say his rapping reminded me of New Edition and Roni.

02:03:26.516 --> 02:03:28.057
[SPEAKER_10]: With Bobby Brown trying to rap.

02:03:28.857 --> 02:03:29.777
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of, kind of.

02:03:30.197 --> 02:03:32.138
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, like I said, throw away songs to wear.

02:03:34.058 --> 02:03:37.239
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what song kind of reminded me of something else?

02:03:44.783 --> 02:03:45.403
[SPEAKER_07]: I like that song.

02:03:45.423 --> 02:03:46.463
[SPEAKER_07]: And that song sucked too.

02:03:46.943 --> 02:03:49.004
[SPEAKER_07]: I like it.

02:03:49.364 --> 02:03:52.866
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, you know what, Captain Jack was the man, but he needs to stick to barking orders.

02:03:53.426 --> 02:03:54.827
[SPEAKER_07]: Because that's when I want to pay attention.

02:03:55.127 --> 02:03:55.507
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't like...

02:03:56.631 --> 02:04:20.167
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't like that, I don't like that pussy Captain Jack in that song, I don't like that, I'm sorry, Captain Jack needs to go, and yes sir, yes sir, yes sir, I will party down right now, there is a song that's actually on the same CD that is called, I don't remember what it's called now, Sir Yes Sir, it's something like that, and it's about like Captain Jack,

02:04:20.595 --> 02:04:25.017
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the kind of song that I'd like to listen at the stroke of 11.30 when I'm about to go to sleep at night.

02:04:25.117 --> 02:04:25.577
[SPEAKER_07]: And then suddenly...

02:04:47.605 --> 02:04:54.648
[SPEAKER_08]: Suddenly I'll wake up in the hospital surrounded by my hot bitches as I'm slipping into my coma.

02:04:56.868 --> 02:04:58.169
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry, wait, hold on.

02:04:58.209 --> 02:04:59.389
[SPEAKER_08]: I need to check with the judges.

02:05:00.290 --> 02:05:04.051
[SPEAKER_07]: Judges, are we allowed to be insensitive after only a week?

02:05:04.651 --> 02:05:05.251
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

02:05:05.331 --> 02:05:06.932
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that politically correct?

02:05:06.952 --> 02:05:07.412
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes!

02:05:07.832 --> 02:05:13.414
[SPEAKER_08]: I was never really sensitive to begin with, so I'm kind of... Please try not to piss off the listeners.

02:05:13.834 --> 02:05:15.075
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi listeners, I love you.

02:05:16.553 --> 02:05:25.059
[SPEAKER_08]: I will give it an 8, because I think that this song should win over the Pendulum song.

02:05:25.159 --> 02:05:26.580
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't forget about the OG bitch!

02:05:27.721 --> 02:05:28.582
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I don't know.

02:05:28.642 --> 02:05:29.983
[SPEAKER_08]: She didn't sound like a gangsta.

02:05:30.683 --> 02:05:35.467
[SPEAKER_08]: The Captain Jack is an OG bitch.

02:05:35.827 --> 02:05:39.330
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm all for the true Compton gangstas.

02:05:39.650 --> 02:05:43.913
[SPEAKER_08]: I like Compton gangstas, not Mexican Latina gangstas.

02:05:45.352 --> 02:05:46.654
[SPEAKER_05]: Angel, what did you think?

02:05:48.536 --> 02:05:53.863
[SPEAKER_10]: It kind of reminded me of the 80s, not so much love songs, but R&B love songs.

02:05:53.903 --> 02:05:54.604
[SPEAKER_10]: The crappy songs, Angel.

02:05:55.305 --> 02:05:56.226
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that'll work.

02:06:04.984 --> 02:06:10.826
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, um, I'll be nice, I guess.

02:06:10.846 --> 02:06:12.087
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm giving a six.

02:06:13.567 --> 02:06:14.708
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, let's recap.

02:06:14.748 --> 02:06:16.228
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not up to us, it's up to you.

02:06:16.869 --> 02:06:18.889
[SPEAKER_07]: You folks in chat room, get your say.

02:06:19.209 --> 02:06:20.770
[SPEAKER_07]: The three songs you can vote for tonight.

02:06:20.810 --> 02:06:22.731
[SPEAKER_07]: Song number one, Pendulum, Hold Your Color.

02:06:28.393 --> 02:06:33.895
[SPEAKER_07]: And song number two you can vote for tonight is Estero with OG Bitch, the Orange Factory Mix.

02:06:41.827 --> 02:06:46.433
[SPEAKER_07]: And song number three you can vote for tonight is Captain Jack with Back Home.

02:06:50.979 --> 02:06:55.124
[SPEAKER_14]: After hours and hours of listening to that song, my brain is hemorrhaging all night.

02:07:05.318 --> 02:07:06.759
[SPEAKER_07]: I turned off the mics in the middle of that.

02:07:07.360 --> 02:07:09.161
[SPEAKER_07]: It's probably best they didn't hear my little song there.

02:07:10.242 --> 02:07:12.704
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, this is the part of the show.

02:07:12.724 --> 02:07:13.724
[SPEAKER_07]: Place vote now.

02:07:13.784 --> 02:07:15.366
[SPEAKER_07]: Send a private message to Sky Chatroom vote.

02:07:16.266 --> 02:07:17.687
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, SimUpdate, what's up?

02:07:18.027 --> 02:07:23.671
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, first off, as I mentioned before, DDR Maniacs is back up for all those who didn't know it.

02:07:24.012 --> 02:07:24.132
[SPEAKER_04]: Woo!

02:07:26.926 --> 02:07:28.287
[SPEAKER_07]: I was looking for and trying to find a link

02:07:49.710 --> 02:07:50.511
[SPEAKER_04]: For the PSP

02:08:08.257 --> 02:08:35.731
[SPEAKER_04]: the DDR one in action with full background videos and it looks pretty cool so far unfortunately all the links are down for it right now and the Beatmania one is available right now I tried downloading it to my PSP but I can't get it to play anything so both of these are still a work in progress right now anyways if you're interested in the link I will post it in the chat room sweet

02:08:37.230 --> 02:08:37.631
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that it?

02:08:38.853 --> 02:08:40.396
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty much it for now.

02:08:40.416 --> 02:08:45.966
[SPEAKER_04]: Other than that, Bill Mysell's back up too.

02:08:45.986 --> 02:08:47.449
[SPEAKER_07]: Are they still begging for money?

02:08:48.671 --> 02:08:48.992
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure.

02:08:50.673 --> 02:08:54.914
[SPEAKER_04]: No, they're putting up more media stuff right now, like sim file stuff.

02:08:55.715 --> 02:08:56.135
[SPEAKER_06]: Good times.

02:08:57.675 --> 02:09:02.597
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I forgot to check and see if they had more sim files up there for Max Remix.

02:09:02.797 --> 02:09:03.217
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, goody.

02:09:03.497 --> 02:09:05.137
[SPEAKER_07]: This is what the world needs, more Max Remixes.

02:09:05.418 --> 02:09:10.099
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think that their sim files are up quite yet, but I'm sure that pretty soon they will be.

02:09:10.619 --> 02:09:16.324
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that actually you can go on ddrmaniax.net.

02:09:16.364 --> 02:09:21.969
[SPEAKER_04]: They have a build in progress right now for Step Mania 4, which is almost done.

02:09:22.850 --> 02:09:24.151
[SPEAKER_04]: So that should be pretty cool.

02:09:25.192 --> 02:09:31.257
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, sim file database, not too much right now for that.

02:09:32.598 --> 02:09:36.822
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm thinking though, I mean they've already got some rave songs in there and

02:09:38.618 --> 02:09:41.820
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure there'll be Max remixes in here pretty soon.

02:09:41.840 --> 02:09:42.200
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, wait a minute.

02:09:42.220 --> 02:09:44.561
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought my style was going to have this whole new look when it came back.

02:09:44.601 --> 02:09:45.261
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks the same.

02:09:46.262 --> 02:09:47.402
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, apparently not.

02:09:47.963 --> 02:09:56.147
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently they lied to us, much like they lied to me when I donated money and said I was going to get special access to an FTP site that never happened.

02:09:56.807 --> 02:09:58.748
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's why I never donate to them.

02:09:58.868 --> 02:09:59.448
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, here we go.

02:09:59.628 --> 02:10:00.309
[SPEAKER_04]: Rave Unlimited.

02:10:00.429 --> 02:10:00.889
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

02:10:01.069 --> 02:10:03.110
[SPEAKER_04]: Max Unlimited remix.

02:10:03.190 --> 02:10:04.011
[SPEAKER_06]: Just what the world needs.

02:10:05.131 --> 02:10:05.932
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, um...

02:10:09.454 --> 02:10:14.816
[SPEAKER_07]: Now we're going to get to the part of the show where we ask our buddy Xtifer to come on and tell us about the movies.

02:10:14.836 --> 02:10:15.796
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you see a movie this week?

02:10:16.396 --> 02:10:17.357
[SPEAKER_07]: I did see a movie this week.

02:10:17.397 --> 02:10:20.078
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, then you know it's time for Xtifer's movie review.

02:10:20.858 --> 02:10:27.320
[SPEAKER_08]: The captain, the captain, the captain.

02:10:27.340 --> 02:10:27.800
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

02:10:27.900 --> 02:10:30.261
[SPEAKER_08]: I just wanted to go, like, stop it.

02:10:30.301 --> 02:10:31.141
[SPEAKER_08]: Stop playing that song.

02:10:31.421 --> 02:10:31.721
[SPEAKER_08]: Stop it.

02:10:33.102 --> 02:10:34.302
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, so what did you see this week?

02:10:35.223 --> 02:10:36.603
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so I saw Saw 2.

02:10:40.257 --> 02:11:06.660
[SPEAKER_08]: and um it was bloody if you like blood and if you like to be scared then Saw 2 is the movie to see I really was scared I was genuinely scared at this movie um I'm easily scared though at films so I mean just don't take that from me I mean you may want to take a look at the reviews on RottenTomato.com it got like really horrible reviews um I don't know I it's I've never seen Saw 1

02:11:08.652 --> 02:11:15.256
[SPEAKER_08]: So, um, I've never, I never saw that, um, although I want to see, I want a seesaw for Christmas.

02:11:16.397 --> 02:11:22.000
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, so, but no, it's, it was really, um, cool.

02:11:22.020 --> 02:11:28.905
[SPEAKER_08]: My sister saw the first one, and, um, she had, uh, told, filled me in on most of the first one before we saw the film.

02:11:29.325 --> 02:11:34.428
[SPEAKER_08]: But I didn't expect the beginning, I just did, like, my mouth was open, I was just like, I was horrified.

02:11:34.528 --> 02:11:36.089
[SPEAKER_08]: It was, it was really scary to me.

02:11:36.738 --> 02:11:41.102
[SPEAKER_08]: But again, I'm kind of a pussy when it comes to scary movies.

02:11:41.543 --> 02:11:42.343
[SPEAKER_08]: Rob, you should know that.

02:11:42.463 --> 02:11:43.524
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god, yes.

02:11:43.645 --> 02:11:44.205
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god.

02:11:44.365 --> 02:11:47.188
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm surprised you don't wet your pants at this movie.

02:11:47.728 --> 02:11:49.270
[SPEAKER_08]: I've never told you if I have or not.

02:11:49.370 --> 02:11:50.071
[SPEAKER_08]: I might have.

02:11:50.711 --> 02:11:51.332
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm kidding.

02:11:52.233 --> 02:11:53.314
[SPEAKER_08]: No, not really.

02:11:54.114 --> 02:11:54.675
[SPEAKER_08]: I am...

02:11:55.819 --> 02:11:57.120
[SPEAKER_08]: Kind of impressed by it.

02:11:57.200 --> 02:11:58.521
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought it was like Silent Hill.

02:11:58.641 --> 02:12:03.925
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought it looked like the look and feel of Silent Hill, the way that it was all set up and everything.

02:12:04.085 --> 02:12:07.788
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, the other thing about this movie is that it seems incredibly, extremely, and horribly violent.

02:12:07.988 --> 02:12:09.729
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, seriously violent.

02:12:09.849 --> 02:12:11.350
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, fucking violent.

02:12:12.071 --> 02:12:14.913
[SPEAKER_08]: It is very violent, and people bleeding all over the place.

02:12:15.253 --> 02:12:21.178
[SPEAKER_08]: But the way the place looks is just exactly like something you see right out of that video game.

02:12:22.359 --> 02:12:24.040
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just was very...

02:12:24.941 --> 02:12:27.222
[SPEAKER_08]: Very, like, just, it was just hard to watch.

02:12:27.242 --> 02:12:29.823
[SPEAKER_07]: Why don't you tell me something about, like, a trap?

02:12:30.243 --> 02:12:36.105
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if it's a spoiler, but you were saying, like, a trap where razor blades are cutting off somebody's arm or something.

02:12:36.305 --> 02:12:50.469
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, there's, like, a plexiglass box with two openings, and, you see, the whole premise is these people are poisoned, and they have to find their antidotes to this toxin that they've been breathing in for, like, you know, the last two hours.

02:12:51.400 --> 02:13:13.529
[SPEAKER_08]: and they're trying to find them throughout this house and one of the girls walks into a room with this plexiglass box like hanging from the ceiling with two openings where hands can go through and an antidote like a syringe is in the middle just standing up and she, they're all, you know, totally No, no.

02:13:13.549 --> 02:13:14.029
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

02:13:14.049 --> 02:13:15.649
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, long story short, bloody.

02:13:16.170 --> 02:13:16.910
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no.

02:13:17.370 --> 02:13:19.572
[SPEAKER_08]: Jamie's about to die from my story.

02:13:19.612 --> 02:13:21.293
[SPEAKER_10]: How does it fucking feel to want?

02:13:23.194 --> 02:13:25.055
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, it's my review, damn it.

02:13:26.977 --> 02:13:30.499
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I, um, bloody, bloody, etc.

02:13:30.839 --> 02:13:33.401
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, that's pretty much, I'll talk about it tomorrow.

02:13:33.461 --> 02:13:34.162
[SPEAKER_08]: How's about that?

02:13:35.042 --> 02:13:35.343
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

02:13:35.803 --> 02:13:38.705
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't listen to my show tomorrow, DarkSakura, or Jamie.

02:13:39.807 --> 02:14:08.558
[SPEAKER_08]: but uh... no but listen because you know you want to uh... and uh... so I actually recommend it I mean if you don't like if you like um... violence to the level of pornography level it wasn't but the thing is I didn't really pay attention to the blood I was genuinely so if you like the guinea pig project you'll like Saw 2 if you like the I've never seen the guinea pig if you like Faces of Death you'll probably like Saw 2 no no no no no it was more scary than gory to me I mean sure there was blood

02:14:09.378 --> 02:14:11.043
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a good Halloween movie.

02:14:18.103 --> 02:14:19.103
[SPEAKER_08]: Happy Halloween!

02:14:19.143 --> 02:14:19.944
[SPEAKER_08]: Thumbs up?

02:14:20.604 --> 02:14:21.704
[SPEAKER_08]: Thumbs up for me.

02:14:21.724 --> 02:14:23.084
[SPEAKER_08]: Thumbs cut off.

02:14:23.104 --> 02:14:25.645
[SPEAKER_08]: Two stumps up.

02:14:26.646 --> 02:14:27.026
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

02:14:28.546 --> 02:14:39.849
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, we're going to go to another break and in this break we're going to hear some stuff from, since one of our callers earlier brought up DDR with Mario, I suppose we could do some music from DDR with Mario.

02:14:40.210 --> 02:14:44.391
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll do that and we'll be back with more Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

02:14:45.522 --> 02:14:47.664
[SPEAKER_07]: and maybe some more Skype calls if we can get into it.

02:14:47.724 --> 02:14:51.927
[SPEAKER_07]: We also definitely have to do the FUs of the week and do the cage match winner as well.

02:14:52.247 --> 02:14:54.549
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll be... Number three.

02:14:55.770 --> 02:14:56.470
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see, we'll see.

02:14:57.431 --> 02:15:01.674
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, we'll be back after this with some DDR with Mario music and Orange Lodge Radio.

02:21:11.539 --> 02:21:12.780
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge Radio.

02:21:13.100 --> 02:21:15.262
[SPEAKER_03]: We put your thing down, flip it, and reverse it.

02:23:13.456 --> 02:23:14.476
[SPEAKER_10]: Would you read it with a fox?

02:23:15.197 --> 02:23:18.199
[SPEAKER_08]: I would read it in a box with a fox.

02:23:19.871 --> 02:23:20.651
[SPEAKER_08]: While eating logs?

02:23:21.412 --> 02:23:22.372
[SPEAKER_08]: While eating a box.

02:23:23.672 --> 02:23:23.972

[SPEAKER_08]: I'm looking out for the fellow straight guys, so if I have to eat a couple pussies to get some listeners, hey, that's the price I will pay to get some listeners.

02:23:38.736 --> 02:23:39.256
[SPEAKER_08]: Extoverse.

[SPEAKER_10]: Pump Up the Volume.

02:24:01.178 --> 02:24:02.279

02:24:02.399 --> 02:24:06.960
[SPEAKER_10]: I've taken to doing it every other Tuesday just because school obligates me.

02:24:06.980 --> 02:24:08.220
[SPEAKER_07]: So you're off this week, actually, right?

02:24:08.320 --> 02:24:09.221
[SPEAKER_10]: This week I will be off.

02:24:09.621 --> 02:24:11.662

[SPEAKER_07]: Rice Princess is coming back on Wednesday.

02:24:43.138 --> 02:24:44.618
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's a Vanilla Sky reunion.

02:24:44.638 --> 02:24:47.080
[SPEAKER_07]: It should be a barrel of monkeys' laughs.

02:24:47.240 --> 02:24:48.020
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be a fun show.

02:24:48.341 --> 02:24:48.801
[SPEAKER_07]: So tune in.

02:24:49.101 --> 02:24:50.022

[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

02:24:53.383 --> 02:24:55.245
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, moving on.

02:24:55.865 --> 02:24:56.405
[SPEAKER_07]: New topic.

02:24:57.206 --> 02:24:57.746
[SPEAKER_07]: Cage match.

02:24:57.766 --> 02:24:59.987
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's talk about who won tonight's cage match.

02:25:00.828 --> 02:25:02.689
[SPEAKER_07]: The winner of tonight's cage match was...

02:25:05.540 --> 02:25:06.021
[SPEAKER_07]: Drumroll.

02:25:06.421 --> 02:25:07.522
[SPEAKER_07]: Extifer, I need a drumroll.

02:25:07.983 --> 02:25:09.405
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

02:25:09.825 --> 02:25:14.791
[SPEAKER_07]: Song that won tonight was... Pendulum with Hold Your Color.

02:25:16.714 --> 02:25:17.535
[SPEAKER_07]: Fourth week.

02:25:18.736 --> 02:25:19.397
[SPEAKER_08]: Retired.

02:25:20.498 --> 02:25:21.019
[SPEAKER_08]: Retired!

02:25:23.339 --> 02:25:24.600
[SPEAKER_08]: That is so sad.

02:25:24.660 --> 02:25:27.981
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, you guys, don't you guys care about Captain Jack?

02:25:28.481 --> 02:25:30.062
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, didn't he die for you?

02:25:31.282 --> 02:25:32.503
[SPEAKER_08]: Didn't he die for your sins?

02:25:33.483 --> 02:25:35.004
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe.

02:25:35.044 --> 02:25:36.604
[SPEAKER_08]: Isn't he going to be coming back soon?

02:25:37.665 --> 02:25:38.245
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, come on.

02:25:38.625 --> 02:25:39.386
[SPEAKER_08]: Come on, people.

02:25:39.686 --> 02:25:39.966
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

02:25:40.686 --> 02:25:41.306
[SPEAKER_07]: Get off the show.

02:25:41.326 --> 02:25:41.687
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm kidding.

02:25:43.127 --> 02:25:44.788
[SPEAKER_07]: Stop gaying up the show, Extover.

02:25:45.308 --> 02:25:46.469
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I'm sorry, Rob.

02:25:46.969 --> 02:25:47.409
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay?

02:25:47.789 --> 02:25:48.950
[SPEAKER_07]: But I thought he was fabulous.

02:25:51.330 --> 02:25:52.371
[SPEAKER_07]: Here, Loki, here's your mic.

02:25:53.732 --> 02:25:54.932
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just kidding, you don't have to leave.

02:25:55.793 --> 02:25:56.133
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

02:25:56.933 --> 02:25:57.713
[SPEAKER_10]: That was great.

02:25:59.434 --> 02:25:59.734
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

02:26:01.095 --> 02:26:01.895
[SPEAKER_07]: So there it is, four weeks ago.

02:26:01.915 --> 02:26:02.835
[SPEAKER_10]: This show needs more gay.

02:26:03.155 --> 02:26:04.776
[SPEAKER_07]: Three new songs.

02:26:04.856 --> 02:26:07.257
[SPEAKER_07]: New, new, newbie, new, newbian songs next week.

02:26:08.953 --> 02:26:10.074
[SPEAKER_07]: I already know what song I'm putting in.

02:26:10.114 --> 02:26:13.296
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not allowing Miklatov to pick my song next week.

02:26:13.596 --> 02:26:16.338
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, is he on?

02:26:17.038 --> 02:26:22.062
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to see if he's on AIM right now, because I might send him a message letting him know.

02:26:22.102 --> 02:26:25.424
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I know if he is online, he's too good to be listening to this program.

02:26:26.685 --> 02:26:29.006
[SPEAKER_07]: But I want to let him know that he won.

02:26:29.687 --> 02:26:30.768
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, he's not online right now.

02:26:30.808 --> 02:26:31.128
[SPEAKER_07]: Denied.

02:26:33.595 --> 02:26:33.875
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura

02:27:01.436 --> 02:27:03.976
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, why is it that we do the FUs of the week every single week?

02:27:08.598 --> 02:27:10.699
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I like this.

02:27:10.719 --> 02:27:11.759
[SPEAKER_07]: This is video game sounding.

02:27:14.940 --> 02:27:16.981
[SPEAKER_07]: Burn, fire, kill, die, burn.

02:27:17.021 --> 02:27:18.041
[SPEAKER_10]: Dude, it's sports fun.

02:27:18.081 --> 02:27:18.721
[SPEAKER_10]: They're pretty cool.

02:27:18.882 --> 02:27:19.682
[SPEAKER_10]: I might change it, though.

02:27:21.485 --> 02:27:23.387
[SPEAKER_10]: But, um, my first F.U.

02:27:23.427 --> 02:27:24.447
[SPEAKER_10]: goes to the cage match.

02:27:25.969 --> 02:27:26.990
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, my second F.U.

02:27:27.070 --> 02:27:28.791
[SPEAKER_10]: goes toward, uh, Captain Jack.

02:27:30.092 --> 02:27:30.653
[SPEAKER_10]: For dying.

02:27:31.253 --> 02:27:31.894
[SPEAKER_10]: How dare he?

02:27:31.914 --> 02:27:41.682
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, no, this isn't Schlagwort, it's Schwarzstein.

02:27:43.360 --> 02:27:45.781
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, another F you goes to being tired.

02:27:47.061 --> 02:27:55.063
[SPEAKER_10]: And, uh, another F you goes toward basically being flaked on by people.

02:27:57.204 --> 02:27:59.604
[SPEAKER_10]: As I look across the room and I'll say that.

02:28:01.045 --> 02:28:02.325
[SPEAKER_10]: I flaked on you, I'm sorry.

02:28:02.645 --> 02:28:03.505
[SPEAKER_10]: I forgot to call you.

02:28:04.406 --> 02:28:07.987
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I went to Red Lobster.

02:28:08.407 --> 02:28:12.908
[SPEAKER_10]: F you to Red Lobster for your tasty food that made me

02:28:14.429 --> 02:28:22.454
[SPEAKER_10]: My first FU goes to the goddamn slow people that have to be in front of me every time I go out driving.

02:28:39.110 --> 02:28:43.212
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's just really retarded people out there that just don't pay attention.

02:28:43.272 --> 02:28:45.394
[SPEAKER_04]: It's always women on their goddamn cell phones.

02:28:45.794 --> 02:28:55.680
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, I have given you plenty of chances to, you know, redeem yourself, but everywhere I look, there's a goddamn woman on her cell phone driving a stupid SUV, nearly hitting something.

02:28:56.360 --> 02:28:56.980
[SPEAKER_04]: All the time.

02:28:57.521 --> 02:29:01.023
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, literally, you cannot go outside without seeing something like that.

02:29:01.883 --> 02:29:02.323
[SPEAKER_04]: It's crazy.

02:29:02.764 --> 02:29:04.445
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you know what SUV stands for.

02:29:05.625 --> 02:29:08.067
[SPEAKER_10]: The Stupid Useless Vehicle for Stupid Useless People.

02:29:11.798 --> 02:29:33.122
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, um, so, fuck them, cause they suck, and, also, uh, fuck the fact that I haven't had any time playing more Final Fantasy, um, really getting behind on that, and trying to cram more minutes into the day is just not working, so, yeah, it sucks, um, also, in general, just, um,

02:29:34.633 --> 02:29:38.615
[SPEAKER_04]: And also, fuck those stupid people on Craigslist that want to charge $135 for a web page design, and

02:29:54.585 --> 02:29:55.685
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, maybe I should... I'm done.

02:30:20.540 --> 02:30:22.741
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm gonna do a new FU song as well tonight, I think.

02:30:23.762 --> 02:30:24.242
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm keeping mine.

02:30:24.262 --> 02:30:25.503
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, that's fine.

02:30:25.683 --> 02:30:26.124
[SPEAKER_07]: I like yours.

02:30:26.664 --> 02:30:26.984
[SPEAKER_06]: For now.

02:30:27.144 --> 02:30:27.845
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm gonna change mine.

02:30:32.228 --> 02:30:37.831
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I'd like to give an FU, um, oh, cute, I like that.

02:30:38.872 --> 02:30:41.614
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, I'd like to give an FU to our, um, apartment complex.

02:30:42.981 --> 02:30:51.470
[SPEAKER_07]: Because our apartment complex, I called them on Monday to tell them that the washer in the apartment was broken, and it took them until today to just bring them a new washer.

02:30:51.490 --> 02:30:52.972
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know why it finally happened today?

02:30:53.232 --> 02:30:56.055
[SPEAKER_07]: Because when I called the office, I actually got to speak to the general manager.

02:30:56.335 --> 02:30:57.937
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's the only reason it got taken care of today.

02:30:58.217 --> 02:30:59.959
[SPEAKER_08]: She had my problem fixed in five minutes.

02:31:00.740 --> 02:31:02.862
[SPEAKER_08]: Seriously, it was just, it was a nightmare.

02:31:02.902 --> 02:31:04.604
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know, not having a washer...

02:31:05.553 --> 02:31:08.735
[SPEAKER_08]: is just plain fucking insane.

02:31:09.415 --> 02:31:13.217
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to, like, rely on your friends to have time to let you use their washer.

02:31:13.757 --> 02:31:13.997
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

02:31:14.137 --> 02:31:20.640
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, because I'm not going to go to no laundromat or whatever to spend money and wash and dry my clothes.

02:31:21.100 --> 02:31:21.400
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyways.

02:31:22.081 --> 02:31:23.641
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

02:31:26.222 --> 02:31:31.805
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's, um, I think that's pretty much my major FU, otherwise FU to the fact that I am going to have

02:31:33.430 --> 02:31:35.993
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm gonna be so, so busy at work in the next couple weeks.

02:31:36.073 --> 02:31:36.654
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm gonna cry.

02:31:36.794 --> 02:31:37.595
[SPEAKER_10]: I have another one, Rob.

02:31:37.715 --> 02:31:38.395
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, but that's alright.

02:31:38.796 --> 02:31:39.236
[SPEAKER_07]: What can you do?

02:31:39.677 --> 02:31:42.680
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, then let's go back to Jamie's music so she can get her last FU up.

02:31:42.960 --> 02:31:47.265
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, my last FU is to myself for leaving directions to somewhere at home, so I have to get back to them.

02:31:47.966 --> 02:31:48.206
[SPEAKER_07]: Dope.

02:31:49.427 --> 02:31:52.290
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, let's go and check out some of our guest FUs.

02:31:52.351 --> 02:31:53.372
[SPEAKER_07]: Started off with DDR Angel.

02:31:54.059 --> 02:32:07.633
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I usually don't bitch about a game, per se, or what happened in the game, but this one redeems itself, you see, because usually you go into a group and hopefully good things happen and you level and blah blah blah, whatever.

02:32:07.913 --> 02:32:09.354
[SPEAKER_10]: This guy was a complete butthead, though.

02:32:09.995 --> 02:32:33.057
[SPEAKER_10]: because as soon as I rolled on the object that I needed, he was like, you don't need that, you're a priest, so you know what, fuck you, and fuck you to kicking me out of the group after you didn't get your way, I mean, it was just massive monster player kill, go in the middle of the mob, run out, and kill the priest, fuck you, and that's

02:32:33.578 --> 02:32:36.342
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks to her, you're FUs of the week.

02:32:48.159 --> 02:32:53.784
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, FU to working for a living.

02:32:53.984 --> 02:32:56.086
[SPEAKER_08]: I second DarkSakura's FU.

02:32:56.606 --> 02:33:01.170
[SPEAKER_08]: I went and applied for another job today, so maybe I'll have two.

02:33:02.531 --> 02:33:04.192
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, I don't know.

02:33:04.232 --> 02:33:09.497
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, I'm just not looking forward to working two jobs, especially the job that I applied for is retail.

02:33:10.337 --> 02:33:11.939
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm the retail king.

02:33:11.959 --> 02:33:14.921
[SPEAKER_08]: But you're going to work at my favorite store and you can get me discounts.

02:33:14.961 --> 02:33:15.602
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm so excited.

02:33:15.722 --> 02:33:17.223
[SPEAKER_08]: That's fucking great.

02:33:18.044 --> 02:33:18.484
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, for you.

02:33:19.324 --> 02:33:22.445
[SPEAKER_08]: I, on the other hand, am not really happy for it.

02:33:22.585 --> 02:33:24.425
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, I mean, it's cool.

02:33:24.445 --> 02:33:26.626
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I just need the extra money.

02:33:26.926 --> 02:33:29.546
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I mean, in the long run, it'll be good for me.

02:33:29.646 --> 02:33:32.487
[SPEAKER_08]: But at the same time, fuck you to working for a living.

[SPEAKER_08]: Can I please go to the chatroom?

02:34:13.346 --> 02:34:15.207

[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

02:38:00.666 --> 02:38:02.827
[SPEAKER_07]: Who told her she could put out one, let alone two?

02:38:02.847 --> 02:38:03.447
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know.

02:38:04.088 --> 02:38:04.368
[SPEAKER_07]: Bitch.

02:38:04.994 --> 02:38:08.117
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you hear that she's going to be making indie films now to get some street cred?

02:38:08.618 --> 02:38:09.899
[SPEAKER_07]: She signed up with some indie films.

02:38:10.339 --> 02:38:11.500
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe she'll die.

02:38:11.901 --> 02:38:15.384
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully those indie films that are porn will involve lots of nudity.

02:38:15.865 --> 02:38:16.465
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that what you want?

02:38:16.665 --> 02:38:19.528
[SPEAKER_08]: I think she should do a remake of the Captain Jack song we heard tonight.

02:38:20.569 --> 02:38:20.929
[SPEAKER_08]: You think so?

02:38:21.170 --> 02:38:21.590
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I do.

02:38:21.610 --> 02:38:22.271
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be good times.

02:38:23.556 --> 02:38:35.931
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, um, we're gonna do, um, actually we're gonna go to one more break, but there's a purpose behind this break, because I wanted to play this for you guys tonight at some point, um, because I just got this, um, from our buddy Miklatov, and he says it's very cool, and I want to play it for you guys.

02:38:36.392 --> 02:38:41.238
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, it's in the Kiriyama Oka track, it's actually System Romance, but it's not the song that we know it from 2DX.

02:38:42.159 --> 02:38:42.339
[SPEAKER_07]: More news!

02:38:42.359 --> 02:38:42.539
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

02:39:01.499 --> 02:39:02.720
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, more news than it is.

02:39:03.321 --> 02:39:05.803
[SPEAKER_07]: And maybe some Ask Orange Lounge if we have time?

02:39:05.983 --> 02:39:06.163
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

02:39:06.383 --> 02:39:07.664
[SPEAKER_07]: If we have time, but we don't know tonight.

02:39:07.704 --> 02:39:09.086
[SPEAKER_07]: Tonight, we may not get to do it.

02:39:09.486 --> 02:39:10.627
[SPEAKER_07]: So, anyway, here we go.

02:39:10.647 --> 02:39:13.469
[SPEAKER_07]: Akira Yamaoka with a guitar version of Sister Romance.

02:39:13.570 --> 02:39:13.770
[SPEAKER_07]: Enjoy.

02:39:31.113 --> 02:39:31.675
Thanks for watching!

02:41:24.479 --> 02:41:25.184
Thanks for watching!

02:41:52.592 --> 02:41:54.875
Thanks for watching!

02:42:58.054 --> 02:42:59.124
Thanks for watching!

02:43:24.865 --> 02:43:25.387
DJ Ranma S

02:44:11.363 --> 02:44:15.244
[SPEAKER_07]: Akira Yamaoka with an instrumental version of System Romance.

02:44:15.904 --> 02:44:22.685
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I promised somebody that we could do one more call over the Skype line, so we're going to go ahead and go to the Skype line for one last call before we get to some more news.

02:44:23.045 --> 02:44:23.985
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:44:25.266 --> 02:44:26.366
[SPEAKER_26]: Hey, Sky, it's John Field.

02:44:26.946 --> 02:44:27.826
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, John, what's on your mind?

02:44:29.507 --> 02:44:30.247
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm doing okay.

02:44:31.567 --> 02:44:32.467
[SPEAKER_07]: What's on your mind tonight?

02:44:33.747 --> 02:44:35.928
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, I've got a pretty big amount to make.

02:44:36.248 --> 02:44:36.588
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

02:44:37.999 --> 02:44:45.923
[SPEAKER_26]: A couple months back, I made an announcement on Orange Lounge Radio, the official announcement about it, that I would be starting up a Phantasy Star Online Mishima.

02:44:46.563 --> 02:44:46.963
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, okay.

02:44:48.083 --> 02:44:49.444
[SPEAKER_26]: And I've got good news about that.

02:44:51.245 --> 02:44:55.667
[SPEAKER_26]: The first episode will be released tomorrow, and I'll be posting a link to it in the chat room.

02:44:56.527 --> 02:44:57.147
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, very cool.

02:44:57.187 --> 02:45:00.189
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, explain for those that might not know, what is a Mishima?

02:45:01.309 --> 02:45:05.611
[SPEAKER_26]: A Mishima is basically the idea of taking a video game, using the characters in it,

02:45:06.444 --> 02:45:10.826
[SPEAKER_26]: and using that to tell a story that's different from what the actual game is like.

02:45:10.846 --> 02:45:13.647
[SPEAKER_26]: Sort of like what Red vs. Blue did for Halo.

02:45:13.847 --> 02:45:18.669
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, and I remember I saw a commercial on TV the other day that was The Sims 2, and it was a very similar kind of thing.

02:45:18.769 --> 02:45:24.091
[SPEAKER_07]: So a lot of folks like that Red vs. Blue stuff, so now you made one for Phantasy Star Online.

02:45:25.052 --> 02:45:25.272
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah.

02:45:25.532 --> 02:45:25.932
[SPEAKER_07]: Very cool.

02:45:25.952 --> 02:45:26.412
[SPEAKER_07]: What's it called?

02:45:27.693 --> 02:45:31.915
[SPEAKER_26]: It's called The Monster Within, and the first episode, like I said, will be out tomorrow.

02:45:32.175 --> 02:45:32.355
[SPEAKER_07]: Mm-hmm.

02:45:33.149 --> 02:45:36.312
[SPEAKER_26]: If it's not up on Archive.org, I'll be hosting it on my own web space.

02:45:36.732 --> 02:45:36.972
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

02:45:37.452 --> 02:45:43.557
[SPEAKER_26]: And hopefully this will be maybe every few weeks or so, I'll have another release out.

02:45:43.838 --> 02:45:46.279
[SPEAKER_07]: Give us a little hint as to the plot of the first episode.

02:45:47.741 --> 02:45:52.104
[SPEAKER_26]: The plot of the first episode is sort of, it takes place before the actual game starts.

02:45:52.164 --> 02:45:56.067
[SPEAKER_26]: It's sort of like you're there seeing the explosion on Red Gold.

02:45:56.728 --> 02:45:56.948
[SPEAKER_07]: Hmm.

02:45:57.898 --> 02:46:00.398
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so a little bit of a prequel going on here.

02:46:00.719 --> 02:46:03.099
[SPEAKER_07]: You going to send this to some folks at Sega, see what they think of it?

02:46:04.439 --> 02:46:08.020
[SPEAKER_26]: Actually, I'm already working with a contact inside Sega.

02:46:08.100 --> 02:46:10.400
[SPEAKER_26]: It's the GM for Blueburst, Clumsy Orchid.

02:46:10.800 --> 02:46:11.160
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

02:46:11.260 --> 02:46:12.040
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, good luck with that.

02:46:12.080 --> 02:46:13.321
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope you have a good time.

02:46:13.381 --> 02:46:15.421
[SPEAKER_07]: And hey, name drop Orin's mom's name somewhere, okay?

02:46:16.581 --> 02:46:16.881
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

02:46:16.901 --> 02:46:17.501
[SPEAKER_07]: Just messing with you.

02:46:17.521 --> 02:46:18.382
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, have a good one.

02:46:18.402 --> 02:46:19.622
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for, and good luck with that.

02:46:19.662 --> 02:46:20.262
[SPEAKER_07]: Let us know how it does.

02:46:20.502 --> 02:46:22.042
[SPEAKER_07]: And post the link in the chat room so we can check it out.

02:46:22.982 --> 02:46:23.162
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

02:46:23.342 --> 02:46:23.603
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

02:46:24.043 --> 02:46:24.343
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

02:46:24.523 --> 02:46:24.823
[SPEAKER_07]: Later.

02:46:25.763 --> 02:46:25.983
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye.

02:46:26.063 --> 02:46:26.243
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye.

02:46:27.449 --> 02:46:27.849
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

02:46:29.349 --> 02:46:30.310
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are always a good time.

02:46:30.610 --> 02:46:41.932
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I forgot to ask if it was going to be like a comedy or a drama kind of thing, because, you know, Red vs. Blue is funny stuff, but the way that kind of sounded, it sounded like it might be a more serious thing, so hopefully it's a little bit of both, though.

02:46:41.972 --> 02:46:42.593
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are the best.

02:46:42.793 --> 02:46:44.253
[SPEAKER_07]: A little bit of both is always a good time.

02:46:44.853 --> 02:46:49.414
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, Loki said he had some news for us, so I want to go ahead and let him have a chance to talk about some news.

02:46:49.774 --> 02:46:52.495
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think I have something else, too, so we got a lot of news here in the last 15 minutes.

02:46:53.584 --> 02:47:09.461
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, anyways, um, stuff I was going to be talking about, um, and we posted this to the site earlier this week about this new dance game that's coming out by the creators of Get on the Mic, and it actually used to be called Get on the Floor, but now it's Flow, the Urban Dance Uprising.

02:47:10.522 --> 02:47:12.064
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, this game is...

02:47:12.642 --> 02:47:14.783
[SPEAKER_06]: The Urban Dance Uprising.

02:47:14.843 --> 02:47:16.284
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Dance Uprising.

02:47:16.304 --> 02:47:19.125
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, you know, Uprising is like a revolution, I guess.

02:47:20.366 --> 02:47:21.727
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's basically DDR.

02:47:22.067 --> 02:47:23.848
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, in every sense.

02:47:24.208 --> 02:47:28.470
[SPEAKER_04]: It is so much like DDR that I'm sure we'll see the lawsuit in a few months here.

02:47:28.550 --> 02:47:30.991
[SPEAKER_04]: But what can I say?

02:47:31.031 --> 02:47:33.032
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all breakbeat music, which is kind of cool.

02:47:33.652 --> 02:47:35.233
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got some pretty good tracks in it.

02:47:35.253 --> 02:47:40.196
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of them I didn't recognize because, I mean, I like breakbeat and stuff, but I don't really...

02:47:41.499 --> 02:47:42.440
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

02:47:56.241 --> 02:48:06.067
[SPEAKER_04]: But two of the main songs I wanted to mention was The Breaks by Curtis Blow and 8th Wonder by Sugar Hill Gang, which are going to be two of the big songs in it.

02:48:06.408 --> 02:48:06.948
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

02:48:07.008 --> 02:48:08.809
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's basically VDR.

02:48:09.329 --> 02:48:10.210
[SPEAKER_04]: Very, very similar.

02:48:12.371 --> 02:48:14.192
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was the one I wanted to mention.

02:48:14.833 --> 02:48:19.396
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that was the only story I had, if I remember correctly.

02:48:20.316 --> 02:48:20.536
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

02:48:20.717 --> 02:48:21.257
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

02:48:21.497 --> 02:48:22.378
[SPEAKER_04]: Just that dance game.

02:48:23.098 --> 02:48:24.459
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be interesting to check out.

02:48:24.926 --> 02:48:27.449
[SPEAKER_07]: I got a couple other things I want to add, which I think is very interesting.

02:48:27.709 --> 02:48:35.840
[SPEAKER_07]: DDR Freak is reporting this week that Carl's Jr., as we know it here on the West Coast, but on the East Coast they call it Hardee's, but same thing.

02:48:36.120 --> 02:48:42.107
[SPEAKER_07]: They're actually going to be running a promotion this November where DDR is going to be advertised on their drink cups.

02:48:42.827 --> 02:48:43.667
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's very interesting.

02:48:43.727 --> 02:48:58.035
[SPEAKER_07]: On their 44-ounce, like their super drink cups, they're going to advertise like DDR games, which I think is very interesting because you consider the types of things that are usually advertised on the side of fast food drink cups, and it's like, well, Extifer, you drink a lot of fast food cups, so what kind of... I'm just kidding.

02:48:58.375 --> 02:48:59.595
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw you grab the mic.

02:48:59.615 --> 02:49:00.836
[SPEAKER_08]: No, you said Carl's Jr., right?

02:49:00.876 --> 02:49:01.056
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

02:49:01.496 --> 02:49:02.737
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I love Carl's Jr.

02:49:02.937 --> 02:49:04.598
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, or Hardee's if you're on the East Coast.

02:49:04.898 --> 02:49:05.398
[SPEAKER_08]: Or Hardee's.

02:49:05.718 --> 02:49:06.259
[SPEAKER_08]: Carl's Jr.

02:49:06.299 --> 02:49:06.959
[SPEAKER_08]: is the best.

02:49:07.637 --> 02:49:08.418
[SPEAKER_08]: It's pretty good.

02:49:08.738 --> 02:49:11.840
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that makes it even better.

02:49:12.120 --> 02:49:15.282
[SPEAKER_07]: You know I once dated somebody who refused to eat at Carl's Jr.

02:49:15.342 --> 02:49:16.583
[SPEAKER_07]: because Carl's Jr.

02:49:16.663 --> 02:49:20.426
[SPEAKER_07]: was giving secret money to anti-gay Republican organizations, supposedly.

02:49:20.728 --> 02:49:24.911
[SPEAKER_08]: Call me Republican and anti-gay because I love Carl's Jr.

02:49:25.411 --> 02:49:30.714
[SPEAKER_08]: Those Western bacons will make me... They are the Western bacon cheeseburger.

02:49:30.794 --> 02:49:36.377
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, so usually they advertise what, like Disney movies on the side of drink cups and whatever else is going on.

02:49:36.998 --> 02:49:39.599
[SPEAKER_07]: But DDR is going to be a promotion at Carl's Jr.

02:49:39.860 --> 02:49:40.800
[SPEAKER_07]: That's very interesting.

02:49:41.080 --> 02:49:41.340
[SPEAKER_04]: It is.

02:49:41.541 --> 02:49:42.101
[SPEAKER_07]: It's interesting.

02:49:42.281 --> 02:49:43.542
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, here's the thing.

02:49:44.302 --> 02:49:48.004
[SPEAKER_07]: Inside the store, there's going to be a big advertising standee and there'll be $5 coupons.

02:49:49.750 --> 02:49:50.650
[SPEAKER_07]: We need a Kiriyamaoka revolution

02:50:11.624 --> 02:50:18.511
[SPEAKER_07]: I keep forgetting that we have international listeners, so they're like, I don't know if it's Canada or what, but somebody's all, we don't have Hardee's here, where?

02:50:18.951 --> 02:50:20.493
[SPEAKER_07]: You're not missing anything, trust me.

02:50:21.113 --> 02:50:22.595
[SPEAKER_04]: Their burgers taste like ass.

02:50:22.675 --> 02:50:23.896
[SPEAKER_10]: Hardee's sells fried chicken.

02:50:25.013 --> 02:50:28.295
[SPEAKER_04]: And they have like, you know, giant sized burgers that taste like ass.

02:50:28.595 --> 02:50:34.258
[SPEAKER_04]: Trust me, I used to like, you know, some of their burgers there, but there's this one Carl's Jr.

02:50:34.298 --> 02:50:38.620
[SPEAKER_04]: that was right by our house and it was really, um, really bad.

02:50:39.060 --> 02:50:46.264
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember probably the pinnacle of their suckiness was when the salt tasted like urine for some reason.

02:50:46.284 --> 02:50:50.406
[SPEAKER_08]: Angel, you'd know about that, right?

02:50:54.307 --> 02:50:54.607
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

02:50:54.768 --> 02:50:55.989
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

02:50:57.370 --> 02:50:57.670
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

02:50:57.750 --> 02:50:59.391
[SPEAKER_10]: Hardee's is cooler than Carl's Jr.

02:50:59.411 --> 02:51:01.253
[SPEAKER_10]: though because they have fried chicken and biscuits.

02:51:03.082 --> 02:51:04.723
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that they're fine.

02:51:05.043 --> 02:51:07.284
[SPEAKER_08]: And if they taste like ass, call me an ass man.

02:51:07.964 --> 02:51:10.225
[SPEAKER_08]: I really like... But, Carl's Jr.

02:51:10.326 --> 02:51:12.286
[SPEAKER_07]: But, Carl's Jr.

02:51:12.346 --> 02:51:14.748
[SPEAKER_07]: has in selected restaurants the green burrito.

02:51:15.528 --> 02:51:16.508
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I don't like green burrito.

02:51:16.648 --> 02:51:17.769
[SPEAKER_08]: But you know what I like?

02:51:17.929 --> 02:51:18.709
[SPEAKER_08]: I like green burrito.

02:51:18.889 --> 02:51:19.470
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I like?

02:51:19.510 --> 02:51:20.850
[SPEAKER_08]: Shut your mouths, women.

02:51:21.090 --> 02:51:28.334
[SPEAKER_08]: My fast food of choice, better than Carl's Jr., though, is Jack in the Box, which I know is also not available in all the states.

02:51:28.974 --> 02:51:29.854
[SPEAKER_10]: Yak in the crack.

02:51:30.395 --> 02:51:31.015
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that's great.

02:51:33.366 --> 02:51:35.287
[SPEAKER_10]: I found out something like a couple weeks ago.

02:51:35.447 --> 02:51:35.667
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

02:51:35.947 --> 02:51:39.129
[SPEAKER_10]: About fast food and... It makes you fat?

02:51:39.209 --> 02:51:40.029
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I do that.

02:51:40.089 --> 02:51:40.650
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, no.

02:51:41.690 --> 02:51:43.191
[SPEAKER_10]: We have a chick-fil-a now.

02:51:43.851 --> 02:51:44.352
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, come on.

02:51:44.552 --> 02:51:45.812
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, big whoop.

02:51:46.173 --> 02:51:46.793
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, hey, hey.

02:51:46.813 --> 02:51:48.774
[SPEAKER_10]: I freaking grew up with a chick-fil-a.

02:51:48.854 --> 02:51:49.914
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, but I didn't.

02:51:50.035 --> 02:51:50.675
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

02:51:50.735 --> 02:51:51.615
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't, but I didn't.

02:51:51.675 --> 02:51:52.256
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

02:51:53.120 --> 02:51:54.201
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck Chick-fil-A.

02:51:54.381 --> 02:51:56.383
[SPEAKER_07]: What's the big deal about Chick-fil-A?

02:51:56.423 --> 02:51:57.984
[SPEAKER_10]: The crack they put in the Polynesian sauce.

02:51:59.325 --> 02:51:59.986
[SPEAKER_10]: I like it.

02:52:00.066 --> 02:52:01.267
[SPEAKER_10]: All Chick-fil-A's are closed on Sunday.

02:52:01.347 --> 02:52:03.569
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, because they're praising Jesus.

02:52:04.335 --> 02:52:08.697
[SPEAKER_10]: But no, I think that it's very admirable that they would take a corporate stance for their beliefs.

02:52:08.837 --> 02:52:12.660
[SPEAKER_07]: I agree, and it's good that the employees at least all get one good day off.

02:52:12.900 --> 02:52:13.640
[SPEAKER_04]: I freaking hate it.

02:52:13.880 --> 02:52:17.562
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, goddamn Tugboat, you know, Fish and Chips, and Nippon.

02:52:17.962 --> 02:52:19.763
[SPEAKER_04]: Both of the places, I love their food.

02:52:19.984 --> 02:52:24.446
[SPEAKER_04]: The only time I really have a chance to get some is on Sundays, and they have to go freaking warship.

02:52:25.166 --> 02:52:28.788
[SPEAKER_04]: They could do that in the morning like normal people, and they come back to work.

02:52:29.469 --> 02:52:33.671
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, some people actually live up to their personal beliefs, maybe.

02:52:34.431 --> 02:52:35.492
[SPEAKER_04]: No one does that anymore.

02:52:36.633 --> 02:52:37.814
[SPEAKER_04]: That's so passe.

02:52:39.535 --> 02:52:43.418
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I have to commend anyone who's willing to take a stance like that for what they believe in.

02:52:43.458 --> 02:52:44.699
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that it's very admirable.

02:52:45.840 --> 02:52:54.327
[SPEAKER_08]: The church crowd, when I used to work at Walmart, when they used to come in, I have horrible stories.

02:52:54.927 --> 02:52:56.368
[SPEAKER_08]: It was the worst crowd in the world.

02:52:57.449 --> 02:53:02.073
[SPEAKER_08]: I swear, you're praising Jesus, and you want, you know, to be saved, and

02:53:02.711 --> 02:53:05.193
[SPEAKER_08]: yet you want to save more money than you want to be saved.

02:53:26.661 --> 02:53:29.143
[SPEAKER_10]: I just said it because I thought you guys missed it or something.

02:53:29.603 --> 02:53:30.243
[SPEAKER_10]: Never mind.

02:53:30.444 --> 02:53:31.204
[SPEAKER_07]: My aim's improving.

02:53:32.965 --> 02:53:36.948
[SPEAKER_07]: If I'm going to have fast food, it's all about Panda Express, and I consider Panda Express fast food.

02:53:38.189 --> 02:53:43.132
[SPEAKER_10]: If I'm going to have fast food, then I'll have cooked it the night before and take it out of the refrigerator.

02:53:43.372 --> 02:53:45.774
[SPEAKER_10]: Funny you said that, Rob, about Panda Express.

02:53:45.834 --> 02:53:45.954
[SPEAKER_07]: Why?

02:53:45.974 --> 02:53:53.659
[SPEAKER_10]: Because all of a sudden I'm thinking of that little cartoon thing they have on the World of Warcraft site that says Pandoran Express, and I'm going, no!

02:53:53.679 --> 02:53:53.719
[SPEAKER_10]: No!

02:53:55.160 --> 02:53:57.721
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, my brain is tainted for the evening.

02:53:57.741 --> 02:53:58.222
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

02:53:58.262 --> 02:54:06.646
[SPEAKER_10]: Seriously, though, if people who are going to go somewhere the next day, they know that they're going to stop to get fast food, isn't it just easier to pack a lunch?

02:54:06.726 --> 02:54:08.607
[SPEAKER_10]: It's cheaper and better for you.

02:54:10.428 --> 02:54:13.069
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that everybody should boycott fast food for a week.

02:54:14.430 --> 02:54:14.950
[SPEAKER_17]: Good.

02:54:15.050 --> 02:54:16.531
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't want to... Good.

02:54:16.551 --> 02:54:18.132
[SPEAKER_17]: Get out of my drive-thru.

02:54:18.972 --> 02:54:19.633
[SPEAKER_10]: No, seriously.

02:54:19.733 --> 02:54:24.115
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that if everybody stopped eating fast food for the duration of one entire week...

02:54:24.835 --> 02:54:29.939
[SPEAKER_10]: A regular food out of the refrigerator that you go to the grocery store and have to prepare.

02:54:30.780 --> 02:54:37.725
[SPEAKER_10]: After a week, I swear, your general level of health and well-being is going to be very improved.

02:54:37.825 --> 02:54:42.068
[SPEAKER_07]: I would make a substantial financial wager that I could go longer without fast food than these two.

02:54:42.929 --> 02:54:43.569
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I believe it.

02:54:45.351 --> 02:54:47.032
[SPEAKER_10]: They wouldn't last five seconds.

02:54:47.512 --> 02:54:49.194
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, right.

02:54:49.554 --> 02:54:51.776
[SPEAKER_04]: Five seconds.

02:54:51.936 --> 02:54:52.837
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going outside.

02:54:53.877 --> 02:54:54.478
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this a bet?

02:54:56.478 --> 02:54:59.960
[SPEAKER_10]: Official Orange Sounds Radio bet.

02:55:00.020 --> 02:55:02.461
[SPEAKER_08]: I am the master of my domain.

02:55:02.741 --> 02:55:06.083
[SPEAKER_08]: I bet I can go six fucking months without eating fast food.

02:55:06.844 --> 02:55:08.184
[SPEAKER_08]: I will put money in it.

02:55:08.985 --> 02:55:12.687
[SPEAKER_08]: If you... I don't believe it.

02:55:12.767 --> 02:55:16.249
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't believe that Christopher would be able to right now.

02:55:17.029 --> 02:55:20.611
[SPEAKER_10]: If he breaks his fast food goal...

02:55:22.196 --> 02:55:26.497
[SPEAKER_10]: Then for every month remaining on the sixth month, he has to pay $10.

02:55:27.758 --> 02:55:31.018
[SPEAKER_10]: So, for example, if he makes it four months and then eats fast food, he has to pay $20.

02:55:31.058 --> 02:55:32.079
[SPEAKER_10]: To what?

02:55:33.019 --> 02:55:34.139
[SPEAKER_10]: To us, for the station.

02:55:36.640 --> 02:55:37.760
[SPEAKER_10]: You have to pay our station bill.

02:55:37.780 --> 02:55:38.280
[SPEAKER_10]: You're on.

02:55:39.581 --> 02:55:40.221
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't eat fast food.

02:55:40.261 --> 02:55:41.041
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not betting shit.

02:55:42.182 --> 02:55:43.062
[SPEAKER_17]: Wait a minute, wait a minute.

02:55:44.862 --> 02:55:48.723
[SPEAKER_07]: Christopher just agreed to something that Loki and I didn't even say we'd participate in.

02:55:48.763 --> 02:55:50.904
[SPEAKER_07]: So now it's all Christopher and how long he can go without fast food.

02:55:51.926 --> 02:55:52.887
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki agrees too.

02:55:54.349 --> 02:55:55.350
[SPEAKER_19]: I didn't agree to shit.

02:55:56.752 --> 02:55:59.836
[SPEAKER_04]: If I don't go and eat fast food, where am I going to get my Best Buy bucks?

02:56:00.296 --> 02:56:00.537
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

02:56:01.798 --> 02:56:02.299
[SPEAKER_04]: Steal them?

02:56:04.782 --> 02:56:10.409
[SPEAKER_10]: See, that's the same type of consumerism crap that's got this country buried, I swear.

02:56:13.775 --> 02:56:17.858
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki just took out like $20 in Best Buy bucks.

02:56:17.878 --> 02:56:18.358
[SPEAKER_07]: $22, actually.

02:56:18.378 --> 02:56:18.738
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

02:56:18.778 --> 02:56:20.939
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you know when the last time I ate fast food was?

02:56:21.140 --> 02:56:21.360
[SPEAKER_07]: When?

02:56:22.060 --> 02:56:24.361
[SPEAKER_10]: Two weeks ago, when I brought a salad.

02:56:25.882 --> 02:56:27.704
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, now what is considered fast food?

02:56:27.724 --> 02:56:30.605
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I don't want extrovert to get off on a technicality.

02:56:30.685 --> 02:56:33.547
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't really consider McDonald's food.

02:56:33.767 --> 02:56:35.388
[SPEAKER_10]: Stepping into a McDonald's?

02:56:35.788 --> 02:56:39.251
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, the only thing that you would ever be allowed to buy from a McDonald's would be a salad.

02:56:39.271 --> 02:56:41.432
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

02:56:41.452 --> 02:56:42.492
[SPEAKER_10]: Because their salads are really good.

02:56:42.553 --> 02:56:42.973
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, then...

02:56:45.487 --> 02:56:48.795
[SPEAKER_08]: So is it any place to buy a salad or is it just McDonald's I can buy a salad?

02:56:49.035 --> 02:56:49.617
[SPEAKER_10]: Any place.

02:56:49.697 --> 02:56:53.385
[SPEAKER_10]: If they've got like salads, good healthy salads, then that's fine.

02:56:53.882 --> 02:56:54.262
[SPEAKER_07]: How about this?

02:56:54.562 --> 02:56:59.063
[SPEAKER_07]: If you go to a place with a drive-thru, you can't get anything with meat.

02:56:59.743 --> 02:57:01.604
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait, no, because that won't work because it's a chicken salad.

02:57:02.384 --> 02:57:03.304
[SPEAKER_10]: And the apple pie.

02:57:03.824 --> 02:57:05.325
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, then you can't get anything but a salad.

02:57:05.365 --> 02:57:07.885
[SPEAKER_10]: The only thing you could get there would be a salad and a drink to go with it.

02:57:08.305 --> 02:57:09.566
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

02:57:09.626 --> 02:57:12.506
[SPEAKER_08]: As long as it's not sugary.

02:57:12.566 --> 02:57:15.887
[SPEAKER_10]: You have to live by my rules of fast food, which is salad.

02:57:16.187 --> 02:57:19.268
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, is Subway and Quiznos considered fast food?

02:57:20.376 --> 02:57:22.261
[SPEAKER_08]: Hell no, it takes 10 minutes to get fucking sandwiches.

02:57:22.301 --> 02:57:23.825
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I don't consider those to be fast food.

02:57:24.026 --> 02:57:29.019
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, but to raise it up a notch, I won't even eat those sandwiches.

02:57:30.038 --> 02:57:30.859
[SPEAKER_10]: You can have salads.

02:57:33.660 --> 02:57:36.802
[SPEAKER_07]: I do not believe you can go six months without Christmas.

02:57:36.942 --> 02:57:37.902
[SPEAKER_07]: I do not believe it.

02:57:37.942 --> 02:57:39.163
[SPEAKER_07]: What the fuck are you going to eat?

02:57:39.423 --> 02:57:41.944
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to eat Nippon every night is what you're going to eat.

02:57:42.184 --> 02:57:43.505
[SPEAKER_08]: Isn't Nippon fast food?

02:57:43.565 --> 02:57:46.447
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Japanese fast food, so I can't even eat that.

02:57:46.467 --> 02:57:47.307
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not fast food.

02:57:47.347 --> 02:57:49.328
[SPEAKER_08]: It takes like five minutes to prepare.

02:57:49.468 --> 02:57:52.170
[SPEAKER_10]: You can eat at a regular restaurant, like Applebee's or Chili's.

02:57:52.230 --> 02:57:52.810
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, that's fine.

02:57:53.516 --> 02:57:58.142
[SPEAKER_10]: You can get salads from these places because salads are good healthy food.

02:57:58.782 --> 02:58:03.368
[SPEAKER_10]: But other than that, anything that you eat that you take to work, you have to take your lunch to work.

02:58:04.895 --> 02:58:09.996
[SPEAKER_10]: You cannot eat burgers or anything unless you go buy meat and grill yourself a burger.

02:58:10.516 --> 02:58:10.756
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

02:58:10.816 --> 02:58:12.217
[SPEAKER_10]: Or go to Outback because they have really good burgers.

02:58:12.277 --> 02:58:13.417
[SPEAKER_08]: I will seriously do this.

02:58:13.537 --> 02:58:14.537
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys are totally on.

02:58:15.017 --> 02:58:18.058
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys are totally, you guys are going to be eating my ass.

02:58:18.078 --> 02:58:19.358
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, well, I'll tell you what, I'll tell you what.

02:58:19.738 --> 02:58:20.818
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll give you some leeway.

02:58:20.858 --> 02:58:21.939
[SPEAKER_10]: Tomorrow is Halloween.

02:58:22.039 --> 02:58:23.099
[SPEAKER_10]: You can eat your candy corn.

02:58:23.299 --> 02:58:24.259
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm starting it tonight.

02:58:24.279 --> 02:58:26.099
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no, because I'm starting my diet on the 1st.

02:58:26.380 --> 02:58:26.720
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, okay.

02:58:27.020 --> 02:58:28.980
[SPEAKER_10]: So that way I can monitor.

02:58:29.660 --> 02:58:29.920
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

02:58:30.340 --> 02:58:31.100
[SPEAKER_10]: I feel so cool.

02:58:31.140 --> 02:58:31.741
[SPEAKER_10]: This is going to be neat.

02:58:32.041 --> 02:58:32.861
[SPEAKER_10]: So starting on the 1st.

02:58:34.326 --> 02:58:35.547
[SPEAKER_10]: What's halfway through?

02:58:35.607 --> 02:58:36.967
[SPEAKER_10]: That's going to be April?

02:58:38.188 --> 02:58:43.610
[SPEAKER_08]: We should have like a biggest loser competition where every Orange Lounge radio show we have to all stand on a weight scale.

02:58:43.630 --> 02:58:44.611
[SPEAKER_10]: No, because I'm at a freaking plateau.

02:58:44.631 --> 02:58:45.251
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, how about this?

02:58:45.351 --> 02:58:45.831
[SPEAKER_04]: How about this?

02:58:46.371 --> 02:58:53.635
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll go, since we're starting here, the six-month mark will actually be my wedding day, so... You know what?

02:58:54.978 --> 02:58:55.558
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm up for this.

02:58:55.679 --> 02:58:57.219
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm up for a Biggest Loser competition.

02:58:57.500 --> 02:58:59.101
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, good.

02:58:59.261 --> 02:59:01.262
[SPEAKER_07]: We can do it without giving out our weights on the air.

02:59:01.302 --> 02:59:01.722
[SPEAKER_10]: Crap.

02:59:01.742 --> 02:59:03.183
[SPEAKER_10]: Does that mean Angel's going to do it too?

02:59:03.203 --> 02:59:04.584
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you going to participate in this too?

02:59:04.764 --> 02:59:04.904
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, shit.

02:59:05.464 --> 02:59:06.205
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

02:59:06.285 --> 02:59:09.627
[SPEAKER_10]: Except it's not really fair to me since I've dropped 60 pounds since 2003.

02:59:10.127 --> 02:59:11.988
[SPEAKER_07]: Then you're the host.

02:59:12.008 --> 02:59:12.609
[SPEAKER_07]: You're the moderator.

02:59:13.633 --> 02:59:16.434
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm the mediator, but I'm participating too, but I'm mediating.

02:59:16.554 --> 02:59:21.297
[SPEAKER_07]: I like this, forget all this other fast food stuff, it's just going to be strictly the biggest loser.

02:59:21.357 --> 02:59:26.819
[SPEAKER_07]: Whoever loses the most weight in, let's make it less than six months, because our listeners don't want to wait that long.

02:59:26.839 --> 02:59:28.300
[SPEAKER_07]: It has to be fast food, it has to be something like that.

02:59:28.480 --> 02:59:36.523
[SPEAKER_10]: I also though, I also though, I can't rely on weight, being myself, seeing as how, okay, I will go ahead and say it on the air, I'm a size 12 right now.

02:59:36.984 --> 02:59:39.785
[SPEAKER_10]: The last time I was a size 12, I was 30 pounds lighter.

02:59:40.936 --> 02:59:43.898
[SPEAKER_10]: So how about whoever loses the most inches off their waist?

02:59:47.080 --> 02:59:49.761
[SPEAKER_10]: Whoever loses the most clothing sizes.

02:59:50.462 --> 02:59:50.762
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

02:59:50.802 --> 02:59:52.703
[SPEAKER_07]: See, now we're getting too complicated and we're running out of show.

02:59:53.363 --> 02:59:53.824
[SPEAKER_10]: That's easy.

02:59:53.904 --> 02:59:55.244
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not dependent on weight.

02:59:55.304 --> 02:59:58.526
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not dependent on really your metabolism.

02:59:58.586 --> 03:00:01.328
[SPEAKER_10]: Whoever loses the most clothing sizes.

03:00:02.669 --> 03:00:03.989
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm still on the fast food thing.

03:00:04.109 --> 03:00:04.750
[SPEAKER_08]: I swear, though.

03:00:04.910 --> 03:00:05.870
[SPEAKER_08]: Fast food for me.

03:00:05.991 --> 03:00:06.351
[SPEAKER_07]: Here it is.

03:00:06.611 --> 03:00:10.113
[SPEAKER_07]: If Christopher can actually go six months with no fast food...

03:00:13.345 --> 03:00:20.030
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm trying to think of something I'll do.

03:00:20.050 --> 03:00:20.090
[SPEAKER_08]: Ew.

03:00:20.450 --> 03:00:20.851
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

03:00:20.871 --> 03:00:20.911
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

03:00:20.931 --> 03:00:21.651
[SPEAKER_17]: No.

03:00:21.711 --> 03:00:22.292
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

03:00:22.512 --> 03:00:23.633
[SPEAKER_08]: All sorts of no.

03:00:23.653 --> 03:00:23.753
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki!

03:00:24.914 --> 03:00:26.155
[SPEAKER_08]: Whose mind is in the gutter?

03:00:28.637 --> 03:00:28.937
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

03:00:29.918 --> 03:00:31.379
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll go ahead and do Biggest Loser.

03:00:32.279 --> 03:00:33.220
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay?

03:00:33.280 --> 03:00:34.761
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a good motivator for everybody.

03:00:35.722 --> 03:00:38.224
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just, we are also, though, going to test BMI.

03:00:41.567 --> 03:00:42.808
[SPEAKER_10]: Bite me, I hate BMI.

03:00:43.288 --> 03:00:46.371
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but BMI is the most accurate way to test fat loss.

03:00:47.872 --> 03:00:49.613
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to go buy a BMI counter.

03:00:50.153 --> 03:00:50.334
[SPEAKER_10]: Ugh.

03:00:51.314 --> 03:00:52.135
[SPEAKER_10]: Hide me.

03:00:52.195 --> 03:00:53.076
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll do it by BMI.

03:00:54.176 --> 03:00:54.797
[SPEAKER_08]: Sounds good to me.

03:00:58.670 --> 03:01:02.471
[SPEAKER_07]: 6 months though is an awfully long time for this to finish, to play out.

03:01:02.551 --> 03:01:03.892
[SPEAKER_08]: It's April, right?

03:01:04.052 --> 03:01:06.132
[SPEAKER_08]: Isn't it 6 months April?

03:01:06.212 --> 03:01:07.373
[SPEAKER_08]: We can go, we can make it.

03:01:08.073 --> 03:01:11.134
[SPEAKER_08]: You remember how we were saying our lease was 6 months ago?

03:01:11.154 --> 03:01:13.855
[SPEAKER_07]: I am not committing to the fast food thing because of my lifestyle.

03:01:13.955 --> 03:01:15.535
[SPEAKER_07]: I just know I won't be able to do it.

03:01:15.635 --> 03:01:17.356
[SPEAKER_07]: I am freely admitting, but I will cut back.

03:01:17.456 --> 03:01:18.036
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll cut back.

03:01:18.416 --> 03:01:18.716
[SPEAKER_07]: I will.

03:01:18.976 --> 03:01:21.017
[SPEAKER_07]: If we're doing like a basic loser, I will participate.

03:01:22.356 --> 03:01:37.678
[SPEAKER_10]: and I'll tell you what, I will make a private live journal community for us but we are going to post running things on the site without giving any specifics out and then we'll be able to let our listeners and if our listeners want to participate in this

03:01:38.439 --> 03:01:39.560
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, we'll think of something.

03:01:40.560 --> 03:01:44.203
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think, you know, because we'd have to have some way to track that.

03:01:44.223 --> 03:01:45.743
[SPEAKER_10]: But you guys, I'll see you in person.

03:01:46.684 --> 03:01:49.526
[SPEAKER_10]: But, you know, I encourage our listeners to participate with us on their own.

03:01:50.386 --> 03:01:52.127
[SPEAKER_10]: If you don't let me have diet soda, I'm going to cry.

03:01:53.228 --> 03:01:53.868
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay!

03:01:54.028 --> 03:01:56.030
[SPEAKER_07]: So Angel's going to participate.

03:01:56.090 --> 03:01:56.630
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to do it.

03:01:57.310 --> 03:01:57.851
[SPEAKER_07]: Extra's going to do it.

03:01:57.871 --> 03:01:58.671
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you doing it too, Loki?

03:01:59.172 --> 03:02:01.253
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to eat all fast food.

03:02:01.553 --> 03:02:02.113
[SPEAKER_07]: No, you're not.

03:02:02.433 --> 03:02:03.314
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I am.

03:02:03.354 --> 03:02:04.675
[SPEAKER_07]: You're going to be the biggest gainer.

03:02:09.810 --> 03:02:13.812
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll have to go double your touch measurement.

03:02:13.832 --> 03:02:14.693
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, no!

03:02:14.713 --> 03:02:17.875
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so Angel, myself, and XRO will be the biggest loser.

03:02:17.895 --> 03:02:19.836
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki will be the biggest loser.

03:02:19.856 --> 03:02:23.799
[SPEAKER_10]: Which means I have to tell the entire house when I get back, no fashion wear six months!

03:02:23.959 --> 03:02:26.841
[SPEAKER_10]: And they're going to give me like, huh?

03:02:26.961 --> 03:02:31.464
[SPEAKER_10]: And to encourage everybody, if anyone wants to go work out, if I'm free, I'll work out with you.

03:02:32.405 --> 03:02:34.146
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm doing it on my own, too.

03:02:35.461 --> 03:02:36.102
[SPEAKER_10]: We're getting the middle.

03:02:37.384 --> 03:02:38.745
[SPEAKER_10]: We're getting the middle, Pat, so I'll be fine.

03:02:38.805 --> 03:02:40.768
[SPEAKER_07]: Six months is too damn long.

03:02:41.589 --> 03:02:42.831
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what, though?

03:02:43.852 --> 03:02:51.702
[SPEAKER_08]: One of the reasons why I'm doing it is because I want to see what kind of benefits this will give me in terms of financial...

03:02:52.523 --> 03:02:53.103
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't have vodka?

03:03:15.851 --> 03:03:16.151
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello.

03:03:16.951 --> 03:03:17.211
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

03:03:17.371 --> 03:03:18.332
[SPEAKER_10]: My microphone works.

03:03:19.152 --> 03:03:20.913
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, we're going way too far.

03:03:20.973 --> 03:03:26.174
[SPEAKER_10]: I do not think this is six months, because if you do it for six months, you're eventually going to get yourself into some healthier habits anyway.

03:03:27.354 --> 03:03:29.375
[SPEAKER_10]: How the hell did we get into this topic anyway?

03:03:29.555 --> 03:03:30.275
[SPEAKER_10]: It just kind of happened.

03:03:30.375 --> 03:03:31.176
[SPEAKER_10]: It was his fault.

03:03:31.856 --> 03:03:33.436
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it's his fault.

03:03:33.636 --> 03:03:36.177
[SPEAKER_10]: Christopher Fryer.

03:03:36.237 --> 03:03:36.637
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm kidding.

03:03:36.657 --> 03:03:40.679
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk about food banks who want some supersized fries.

03:03:41.479 --> 03:03:42.839
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds good right now.

03:03:42.859 --> 03:03:44.760
[SPEAKER_10]: That sounds fucking disgusting.

03:03:44.820 --> 03:03:45.120
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

03:03:45.680 --> 03:03:51.223
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, I was like, shit, I was planning on getting Pizza Hut after the show tonight.

03:03:51.283 --> 03:03:56.565
[SPEAKER_07]: Now I have to set a fucking example for my roommate who just made a fucking stupid bet on his show.

03:03:58.146 --> 03:04:01.167
[SPEAKER_10]: For every month that you have failed, it's $10 you pay for the show.

03:04:01.347 --> 03:04:04.769
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to think of a prize that you get if you win.

03:04:05.169 --> 03:04:07.650
[SPEAKER_10]: If you make it, I will take you out to dinner.

03:04:08.110 --> 03:04:08.370
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

03:04:09.050 --> 03:04:10.271
[SPEAKER_10]: Wherever you want, whenever you want.

03:04:10.971 --> 03:04:14.691
[SPEAKER_08]: You're not, you're gonna change your lifestyle for six months for a fucking free dinner?

03:04:15.232 --> 03:04:16.492
[SPEAKER_08]: That, it sounds good to me.

03:04:17.612 --> 03:04:23.633
[SPEAKER_08]: I, I, you know what, you, you, free dinner's pretty good when you're living on your own, you know what, you know what I mean.

03:04:24.454 --> 03:04:25.234
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, alright.

03:04:25.354 --> 03:04:30.315
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yeah, I can see Loki like every week coming in with a big old burger in front of us.

03:04:30.395 --> 03:04:32.555
[SPEAKER_08]: I will think of a prize as well to sweeten up the pot.

03:04:33.015 --> 03:04:33.255
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

03:04:35.016 --> 03:04:35.816
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm thinking Red Lobster.

03:04:37.679 --> 03:04:41.041
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to switch from single quarter pounders to double quarter pounders.

03:04:41.261 --> 03:04:44.604
[SPEAKER_10]: I was going to say something, but I'm disgusted and I threw that out there.

03:04:47.025 --> 03:04:47.766
[SPEAKER_07]: End of show.

03:04:48.006 --> 03:04:48.787
[SPEAKER_07]: Final thoughts.

03:04:49.407 --> 03:04:50.348
[SPEAKER_07]: Angel, your final thought.

03:04:52.029 --> 03:04:53.029
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I can do this.

03:04:53.170 --> 03:04:57.432
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll have to go yell at the roomies at home and tell them no fast food.

03:04:57.873 --> 03:04:58.053
[SPEAKER_10]: Ever.

03:05:00.034 --> 03:05:00.975
[SPEAKER_07]: Extifer, final thought.

03:05:04.421 --> 03:05:07.422
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, somebody in chat wanted to hear the drumroll one more time.

03:05:10.383 --> 03:05:10.723
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

03:05:10.743 --> 03:05:13.603
[SPEAKER_10]: That sounds like a really messed up, I mean, Murloc.

03:05:14.664 --> 03:05:15.464
[SPEAKER_04]: Addict.

03:05:15.544 --> 03:05:17.504
[SPEAKER_04]: I am Sam drumroll or something.

03:05:17.804 --> 03:05:19.304
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, your final thought.

03:05:19.805 --> 03:05:29.447
[SPEAKER_04]: My final thought is this is the perfect week for me to actually roll out my hybrid beef slash sausage hamburger with double bacon, double cheese.

03:05:31.127 --> 03:05:31.407
[SPEAKER_07]: Yummy.

03:05:33.574 --> 03:05:33.974
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

03:05:34.655 --> 03:05:34.995
[SPEAKER_07]: Here it is.

03:05:35.235 --> 03:05:35.756
[SPEAKER_07]: Six months.

03:05:36.576 --> 03:05:38.598
[SPEAKER_07]: If you can go six months, I'll buy you a fucking DS.

03:05:42.060 --> 03:05:43.421
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

03:05:43.701 --> 03:05:46.043
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll give you a fucking DS if you can go six months.

03:05:46.483 --> 03:05:46.723
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

03:05:48.304 --> 03:05:48.785
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, cool.

03:05:49.545 --> 03:05:49.765
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

03:05:51.407 --> 03:05:56.669
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, my final thought would be, um, X-Verse Crazy.

03:05:58.429 --> 03:05:59.470
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, your final thought.

03:05:59.910 --> 03:06:03.411
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, reject false icons, and even better, reject fast food.

03:06:04.311 --> 03:06:07.132
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, fucking chatroom, fucking chatroom.

03:06:08.313 --> 03:06:12.314
[SPEAKER_07]: There's gonna be a betting pool for the fucking biggest loser contest we're having.

03:06:12.374 --> 03:06:13.875
[SPEAKER_07]: You fucking bet on me.

03:06:14.335 --> 03:06:14.675
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

03:06:15.215 --> 03:06:17.476
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I already won since I did drop 60 pounds.

03:06:18.249 --> 03:06:19.930
[SPEAKER_07]: But you're not participating in this competition.

03:06:20.030 --> 03:06:22.491
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm monitoring because I'm the help guru.

03:06:22.511 --> 03:06:23.552
[SPEAKER_07]: You're setting an example.

03:06:23.892 --> 03:06:24.692
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm the example.

03:06:24.712 --> 03:06:25.393
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm so cool.

03:06:25.833 --> 03:06:26.433
[SPEAKER_07]: Odds are in.

03:06:26.754 --> 03:06:27.534
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki is 99 to 1 odds.

03:06:32.281 --> 03:06:33.242
[SPEAKER_07]: God, I love you guys.

03:06:33.302 --> 03:06:34.483
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to get in on that action.

03:06:34.643 --> 03:06:35.683
[SPEAKER_07]: I fucking love you guys.

03:06:35.823 --> 03:06:36.184
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

03:06:36.644 --> 03:06:39.846
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously, chat room, you people make this show, and everybody that listens.

03:06:39.986 --> 03:06:41.647
[SPEAKER_10]: We love you, chat room.

03:06:41.928 --> 03:06:42.288
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

03:06:42.808 --> 03:06:44.409
[SPEAKER_07]: You motivate us to be thin.

03:06:44.429 --> 03:06:46.231
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, I have one other thing.

03:06:46.711 --> 03:06:46.931
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

03:06:47.091 --> 03:06:53.355
[SPEAKER_10]: For all of my fellow Gorillaz fans, they're broadcasting the Manchester show on BBC One, streaming.

03:06:53.816 --> 03:06:55.777
[SPEAKER_10]: BBC One, BBC Two.

03:06:56.017 --> 03:06:56.538
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, anyway.

03:06:58.259 --> 03:06:59.420
[SPEAKER_07]: Fucking, we've got to end the show already.

03:06:59.480 --> 03:07:00.080
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, bye.

03:07:00.120 --> 03:07:01.161
[SPEAKER_07]: Last word, Loki.

03:07:02.654 --> 03:07:03.594
[SPEAKER_21]: Surprise!

03:07:04.795 --> 03:07:09.658
[SPEAKER_21]: That does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live.

03:07:38.834 --> 03:07:40.635
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a song about a whale.

03:07:41.055 --> 03:07:41.335
[SPEAKER_09]: No!

03:07:43.236 --> 03:07:45.098

[SPEAKER_09]: That's right.

03:07:47.619 --> 03:07:50.201

[SPEAKER_09]: I'll teach you to be happy.

03:08:13.095 --> 03:08:14.916
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll teach your grandmother to suck eggs.

03:08:15.876 --> 03:08:18.557
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, boys and girls, let's try it again.

03:08:20.365 --> 03:08:21.946

[SPEAKER_09]: Happy, happy, joy, joy.

03:08:33.771 --> 03:08:35.832
[SPEAKER_09]: If and you ain't the granddaddy of all liars.

03:08:37.593 --> 03:08:38.994
[SPEAKER_09]: The little critters of nature.

03:08:39.794 --> 03:08:40.875
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't know that they're ugly.

03:08:41.955 --> 03:08:42.796
[SPEAKER_09]: That's very funny.

03:08:43.556 --> 03:08:45.337
[SPEAKER_09]: A fly marrying a bumblebee.

03:08:46.577 --> 03:08:47.658
[SPEAKER_09]: I told you I'd shoot.

03:08:48.365 --> 03:08:49.306
[SPEAKER_09]: But you didn't believe me.

03:08:50.046 --> 03:08:51.307
[SPEAKER_09]: Why didn't you believe me?

03:08:51.948 --> 03:08:53.349
Happy, happy, joy, joy

03:09:19.122 --> 03:09:22.613
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.

03:09:56.815 --> 03:10:05.858
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, the guys just did their weigh-ins for the, uh, and we're not going to say our weight because the whole idea is that we don't have to say our weight, but, oh my god, I was surprised.

03:10:06.599 --> 03:10:09.960
[SPEAKER_07]: I hit a certain landmark that I didn't think I was over yet, and I'm like, oh, fuck.

03:10:09.980 --> 03:10:11.861
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, so we'll see what happens.

03:10:14.606 --> 03:10:16.267
[SPEAKER_07]: Did I really tell Extra Fried to buy him a DS?

03:10:16.787 --> 03:10:17.387
[SPEAKER_07]: God, I'm poor.

03:10:17.547 --> 03:10:18.087
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, you did.

03:10:18.127 --> 03:10:19.948
[SPEAKER_07]: We have proof of that.

03:10:19.988 --> 03:10:20.328
[SPEAKER_07]: That's fine.

03:10:20.348 --> 03:10:21.969
[SPEAKER_07]: If he can go six months without fast food, he earned it.

03:10:21.989 --> 03:10:24.710
[SPEAKER_07]: And I bet you anything Jay will get in on that, too.

03:10:25.310 --> 03:10:25.890
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll bet you anything.

03:10:26.170 --> 03:10:30.972
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm telling you right now, I'm at a plateau right now where I can eat as much fast food as I want, and I stay the same weight, so you know what?

03:10:30.992 --> 03:10:33.893
[SPEAKER_07]: To be fair, you won a mat.

03:10:33.913 --> 03:10:34.433
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, okay.

03:10:34.453 --> 03:10:36.614
[SPEAKER_07]: You won a mat.

03:10:36.654 --> 03:10:36.874
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

03:10:36.914 --> 03:10:38.655
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you are going to participate, too, then, Miss Jay?

03:10:40.196 --> 03:10:41.256
[SPEAKER_10]: As a motivator for everybody.

03:10:42.242 --> 03:10:42.742
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't believe it.

03:10:42.762 --> 03:10:46.665
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're going to track this on the website, like how much weight we all... I'm not eligible for any prizes.

03:10:47.405 --> 03:10:50.987
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm still moderating it, so I'm not eligible for any prizes, but I'm doing it for motivation purposes.

03:10:51.848 --> 03:10:53.449
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be a crazy six months, gang.

03:10:54.622 --> 03:10:57.663
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but I've needed to do it since I met you guys, so you know what?

03:10:57.963 --> 03:10:58.603
[SPEAKER_10]: It's time to go.

03:10:59.043 --> 03:11:00.183
[SPEAKER_10]: One thing, though, that, you know...

03:11:22.853 --> 03:11:25.035
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, all I want, if I win, I want sex.

03:11:25.315 --> 03:11:27.557
[SPEAKER_07]: Not with any of you, I just want sex in general.

03:11:28.157 --> 03:11:28.898
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll hire somebody.

03:11:28.978 --> 03:11:29.898
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, sounds awesome.

03:11:30.299 --> 03:11:33.481
[SPEAKER_07]: On this note, we really got to pull the plug, guys, so we can get to our podcast.

03:11:33.501 --> 03:11:34.842
[SPEAKER_10]: If I win, I want fries.

03:11:34.982 --> 03:11:37.164
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, good night, thank you.

03:11:37.184 --> 03:11:39.465
[SPEAKER_10]: If you win, I'm buying you five pounds of fries.

03:11:39.626 --> 03:11:40.206
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, hell yeah.

03:11:41.947 --> 03:11:42.768
[SPEAKER_13]: Let it be noted.

03:11:43.969 --> 03:11:45.530
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, we're done, we're done.

03:11:46.210 --> 03:11:49.633
[SPEAKER_07]: Tune back in, 15 seconds, Orange Lodge Radio, video game music.
