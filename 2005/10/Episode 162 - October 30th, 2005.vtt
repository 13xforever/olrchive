ASMR

01:58.840 --> 02:17.020
The following live program is a special presentation of Orange Lounge Radio.

02:17.020 --> 02:20.520
The following program is intended for mature audiences.

02:20.520 --> 02:27.560
Good evening, everybody out there on the interweb.

02:27.560 --> 02:31.720
listening to Orange Lounge Radio. We're about ready to kick off tonight's program.

02:31.720 --> 02:36.760
Happy Halloween, you weenies! We're gonna be talking tonight about Ultramix 3.

02:36.760 --> 02:44.600
Extrofer is gonna review a snuff film on tonight's show, and I don't know, whatever else

02:44.600 --> 02:49.840
tickles our fancies. Dark Soccer was out for last week, so she's gonna

02:49.840 --> 02:55.640
tell you all about her week off. Is your mic on? It is now. There we go. I had to go

02:55.640 --> 02:58.640
We're going to talk about field trips.

02:58.640 --> 02:59.640
It sucks!

02:59.640 --> 03:02.640
We're going to reminisce about good old times.

03:02.640 --> 03:05.640
But first, a brief introduction.

03:05.640 --> 03:12.640
Orange Lounge Radio is presented in the TMI sound format.

03:35.640 --> 03:37.640
Oh

03:37.640 --> 04:04.480
Oh, God, hey, hey, hey, call me Daddy

04:04.480 --> 04:14.480
Orange Lounge may contain adult content. Orange Lounge may contain many four-letter words.

04:14.480 --> 04:21.480
Orange Lounge may contain a scene of beauty. Orange Lounge may contain plenty of...

04:24.480 --> 04:29.480
Just kidding, Orange Lounge Radio will not contain any of that. In this episode...

04:29.480 --> 04:31.480
Well, isn't that special?

04:35.480 --> 04:46.480

05:23.140 --> 05:27.100
My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Skye, joining me as always from my awesome

05:27.100 --> 05:31.700
co-hosts in this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm, is Stark Sakura.

05:31.700 --> 05:32.700
Jamie Summers.

05:32.700 --> 05:33.700
That was lovely.

05:33.700 --> 05:34.700
Tasted like burrito.

05:34.700 --> 05:35.700
It tastes like burning.

05:35.700 --> 05:36.700
No, it tasted like burrito.

05:36.700 --> 05:37.700
You know what's funny?

05:37.700 --> 05:44.140
I think your mic faded out, like right at the point where you burped, so it didn't pick

05:44.140 --> 05:45.700
it up even, which is great.

05:45.700 --> 05:46.700
Burp!

05:46.700 --> 05:48.700
There you go.

05:48.700 --> 05:50.700
Also with us tonight, say hello to Tech Masuloki.

05:50.700 --> 05:51.700
Hi.

05:51.700 --> 05:52.700
How you doing?

05:52.700 --> 05:58.140
But you seem a little withdrawn tonight giving me one word answers. I don't know

05:58.140 --> 06:02.820
I just haven't gotten into this show yet. Are you are you committed to this program? Yes

06:03.700 --> 06:07.580
You better be all right also with us tonight. Say hello to

06:08.220 --> 06:11.500
The crazy the delusional, but it's very funny extrovert

06:12.420 --> 06:17.900
Yo, yo, how you doing extrovert? I'm doing great with a side of good

06:17.900 --> 06:18.900
Good.

06:18.900 --> 06:21.900
That's wonderful to hear.

06:21.900 --> 06:24.900
Also with us tonight, say hello to Ms. DDR Angel.

06:24.900 --> 06:25.900
Hello.

06:25.900 --> 06:26.900
How you doing?

06:26.900 --> 06:27.900
I'm good.

06:27.900 --> 06:33.900
Yeah, I've got a lot of stuff to talk about, but I guess we can talk about that later.

06:33.900 --> 06:37.900
As I have news about said convention from this weekend.

06:37.900 --> 06:38.900
Hint.

06:38.900 --> 06:39.900
Elbow.

06:39.900 --> 06:40.900
Hint.

06:40.900 --> 06:41.900
Did you go to Blizzcon?

06:41.900 --> 06:42.900
No, I didn't.

06:42.900 --> 06:43.900
I know a lot of news about it.

06:43.900 --> 06:44.900
I was like, the fuck?

06:44.900 --> 06:46.900
We had representation at Blizzcon?

06:46.900 --> 06:55.900
Um, sort of. I kind of had my ends as far as finding out about stuff, even though I wasn't there. Does that make sense?

06:55.900 --> 07:04.900
Okay, I gotcha. I'll talk about my relationship with Blizzard Entertainment in a little while. We'll talk about that when we come back. How's that sound?

07:04.900 --> 07:08.900
Sure. No, that's fine. I just wanted to, you know, get out there.

07:08.900 --> 07:15.900
I love Blizzard now, which is ironic because I used to think they were so overrated, but ever since I started playing World of Warcraft, I can't fucking stop.

07:15.900 --> 07:20.580
and then i would like to know how to get a blue and i don't know if they will not

07:20.580 --> 07:23.260
tell you what i've ran laughter

07:23.260 --> 07:25.140
fifteen years ago

07:25.140 --> 07:27.740
that you know i'm not

07:27.740 --> 07:30.300
the public rocket

07:30.300 --> 07:32.520
yet but this really big interesting

07:32.520 --> 07:36.420
uh... it was in the end isn't that that new movie like you monday

07:36.420 --> 07:37.760
you know

07:37.760 --> 07:44.060
uh... or that the medication you take with your depressed that that a lot

07:44.060 --> 07:48.060
Anyway, I have a lot of news about that. We can talk about that when we get back.

07:48.060 --> 07:52.060
Other than that, I've probably got some other stuff.

07:52.060 --> 07:56.060
Well good, I'm glad someone's on task tonight, because I have really nothing. I was just going to wing it for three hours.

07:56.060 --> 08:02.060
I don't know about DarkSakura and Loki, but I can already tell Loki's kind of distance from the show.

08:02.060 --> 08:05.060
Anyway, yeah, hi.

08:05.060 --> 08:11.060
And DarkSakura, I don't even know if what she's got on the screen is related to the show.

08:11.060 --> 08:18.060
I'm looking at Playgirl models.

08:18.060 --> 08:21.060
Let's go to a break, kids. We'll be back after this with more...

08:21.060 --> 08:23.060
I'm looking at naked Darryl Hannah.

08:23.060 --> 08:28.060
Oh, sorry. I'm actually going to be ordering Clan of the Cave Bear.

08:28.060 --> 08:29.060
You guys are so weird.

08:29.060 --> 08:30.060
And Iguana Girl says hi.

08:30.060 --> 08:32.060
Oh, right on. Hey.

08:32.060 --> 08:35.060
Is her people very gray and wiry?

08:35.060 --> 08:36.060
What?

08:36.060 --> 08:37.060
Darryl Hannah.

08:37.060 --> 08:38.060
I don't know it.

08:38.060 --> 08:41.060
Oh, I thought you were talking about Iguana Girl. I was like, what?

08:41.060 --> 08:44.060
Oh, no, no, no, no. I was talking about Daryl Hannah.

08:44.060 --> 08:48.060
But it's Iguana Girls. No, I'm kidding.

08:48.060 --> 08:52.060
On that note, let's go to a break.

08:52.060 --> 08:55.060
And we'll be back after this. And we might actually talk about some music game stuff.

08:55.060 --> 09:00.060
Because apparently Ultra Mix 3, the song list released, and there's a concert coming to town,

09:00.060 --> 09:02.060
and all this other garbage I want to talk about too.

09:02.060 --> 09:05.060
We'll be back after this. Oh, join our chat room, won't you?

09:05.060 --> 09:12.060
click on chat. We'll start it off this break with a little bit of Taku from 2DX4 style. Enjoy.

11:05.060 --> 11:16.080
Long live the

13:46.080 --> 13:50.080
Johnny wanted to you

14:16.080 --> 14:18.080
Ready, steady, go!

14:46.080 --> 14:48.080
Ready, steady, go!

14:50.080 --> 14:52.080
Lyrical style of my blow, yo

14:55.080 --> 14:56.080
Yo, ready

14:57.080 --> 14:58.080
Ready

14:59.080 --> 15:01.080
Lyrical style of my blow, yo

15:01.080 --> 15:03.080
Ready, steady, go!

15:05.080 --> 15:07.080
Strictly the motherfucker

15:07.080 --> 15:14.080
I'm ready, steady, go I'm ready, steady, go

15:37.080 --> 15:44.080
Gaming radio, so uncensored, that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.

15:44.080 --> 15:46.080
Uh, Mooch, uh, Moo-kaw-key.

15:46.080 --> 15:48.080
Orange Lounge Radio.

15:48.080 --> 15:49.080
Taxcon.

15:54.080 --> 15:56.080
Hi, we're here.

15:56.080 --> 15:58.080
I like Doritos, Rob.

15:58.080 --> 16:00.080
Do you? That's good to hear.

16:00.080 --> 16:02.080
It sounds like it. I mean, literally.

16:02.080 --> 16:04.080
It smells like it, too.

16:04.080 --> 16:05.080
We all know.

16:05.080 --> 16:08.080
Oh, that mic's getting retired before the end of the night. I don't know what the fuck's going on with it.

16:08.080 --> 16:11.080
Hi! This microphone sucks a big chunk of ass.

16:11.080 --> 16:12.080
Oh, that's what it is.

16:12.080 --> 16:14.080
Do you want me to pick up a new mic?

16:14.080 --> 16:15.080
Are you going to Target?

16:15.080 --> 16:16.080
And you can reimburse me?

16:16.080 --> 16:18.080
F yes. Go to Target and get a new mic.

16:18.080 --> 16:19.080
Okay.

16:19.080 --> 16:21.080
That's awesome.

16:21.080 --> 16:23.080
I'm so awesome, aren't I?

16:23.080 --> 16:24.080
You're okay.

16:24.080 --> 16:26.080
Aww.

16:26.080 --> 16:28.080
Alright, so we'll get that fixed.

16:28.080 --> 16:31.080
Good, that means that'll be fixed before the podcast. That makes me happy.

16:31.080 --> 16:33.080
So anyway.

16:33.080 --> 16:35.080
Wow, that kind of threw me.

16:35.080 --> 16:39.100
I just think it would be really funny if one day we were at a break and then we just didn't

16:39.100 --> 16:40.100
come back.

16:40.100 --> 16:43.440
You just kind of hear the music in the background and we're not there.

16:43.440 --> 16:45.280
Actually, maybe we already pulled that prank.

16:45.280 --> 16:46.280
I don't know.

16:46.280 --> 16:47.280
Anyway, hi.

16:47.280 --> 16:48.400
You're listening to Orange Andrea.

16:48.400 --> 16:49.400
We are here.

16:49.400 --> 16:50.400
We are live.

16:50.400 --> 16:54.400
I noticed, just judging from the names I see in chat room, we have quite a few people tonight

16:54.400 --> 16:56.420
who haven't listened before.

16:56.420 --> 17:00.560
And judging from what's been going on in general in the past 10 months, we have more and more

17:00.560 --> 17:03.620
people listening to us thanks to our podcast, which I think, you know, that's awesome. That's

17:03.620 --> 17:07.580
the whole idea. We did a podcast in the first place. It's because we were like, oh, maybe

17:07.580 --> 17:10.920
we'll get like two or three people listening to the podcast that'll come over and then

17:10.920 --> 17:15.720
listen to our live show. And then the fucking podcast gets like 40 times the listeners our

17:15.720 --> 17:20.040
live show gets. It's crazy. But it's cool. No, we love it. We love the fact that, you

17:20.040 --> 17:25.960
know, people are listening to it and just loving it. But I do, I do got to warn people,

17:25.960 --> 17:29.640
the live show's not really like the podcast. Because the podcast, you know, we're sitting

17:29.640 --> 17:32.480
around, we're talking about games, we're letting you know about, you know, what video games

17:32.480 --> 17:35.920
are coming out, and we're just the news, we're telling you guys the news and what's going

17:35.920 --> 17:40.520
on and giving you our big fat opinions and all that, but this three hour show, well,

17:40.520 --> 17:44.480
it's about the music-based video games, supposedly, I mean, that's, you know, the ideas that we

17:44.480 --> 17:51.040
talk about DDR and 2DX, but, I mean, let's face it, if you look at the DDR scene in general,

17:51.040 --> 17:52.880
what's happened to the DDR Freak boards?

17:52.880 --> 17:57.160
It's like this, it's like, we're dedicated, this show is dedicated to music games like

17:57.160 --> 17:59.000
MTV is dedicated to music.

17:59.000 --> 18:04.280
Yes, that's a great analogy. We are the MTV of music gaming.

18:04.280 --> 18:07.480
I can't really say anything too bad about the DDR Freak boards, though.

18:07.480 --> 18:10.400
No, I'm not saying a negative thing. No, no, no, no. Not just because I moderate

18:10.400 --> 18:11.400
there. Right.

18:11.400 --> 18:14.960
But because I've seen worse. Oh, yeah. No, no. I'm not saying anything.

18:14.960 --> 18:18.080
I mean, if I wanted to say something negative about the DDR Freak boards, I'd go to a different

18:18.080 --> 18:20.680
topic. But the DDR Freak boards in general, if you

18:20.680 --> 18:25.960
notice where the majority of posts are, well, maybe not the majority, but the real active

18:25.960 --> 18:32.900
users and the long-time users all kind of flock to one forum, random chat.

18:32.900 --> 18:35.700
So we are the random chat of the internet. I don't know.

18:35.700 --> 18:45.700
Random chat lately is the bane of my existence. Anyway, that is a great analogy. I'm sorry,

18:45.700 --> 18:52.820
that was great. We're like MTV is to music. Anyway, oh, even the chat room agrees. Loki

18:52.820 --> 18:57.500
he wins the show says uh... in bq good job people are still in the same way

18:57.500 --> 19:01.380
g_-four has nothing to do it in the g_-four is is um...

19:01.380 --> 19:03.140
young man television and

19:03.140 --> 19:06.100
at the stretch of that i'm confused by g_-four

19:06.100 --> 19:10.000
they confuse me a first up why they play fast lane cuz

19:10.000 --> 19:12.460
at show shouldn't be on erin any station

19:12.460 --> 19:15.520
or remember that one episode of a play bdr in it

19:15.520 --> 19:19.940
all i get that probably tied up with the video game and i still want to be there

19:19.940 --> 19:22.080
you know put on station

19:22.080 --> 19:23.080
sounds good to me

19:23.080 --> 19:26.080
well maybe they'll put on like you know will and grace now on that show because

19:26.080 --> 19:29.620
you know they play DDR in one episode

19:29.620 --> 19:32.820
that's like that logo channel playing wonder falls

19:32.820 --> 19:36.240
you know just because there was a lesbian couple in wonder falls they put

19:36.240 --> 19:37.500
on the whole show

19:37.500 --> 19:41.160
logo by the way being the gay lesbian I'm sorry for all of you

19:41.160 --> 19:45.480
people that don't like to be fucked up the ass

19:45.480 --> 19:48.000
logos for gay people

19:48.000 --> 19:51.200
What does it, it doesn't, my, my mother watches Logo.

19:51.200 --> 19:53.400
Oh, it's not just for Gabe, it's about Gabe.

19:53.400 --> 19:55.600
Some people don't have cable.

19:55.600 --> 19:56.600
Oh, well, Logo...

19:56.600 --> 19:58.600
Some people have to live with core TV.

19:58.600 --> 20:00.200
So it's like Bravo?

20:02.800 --> 20:04.200
Psychic detectives.

20:04.200 --> 20:07.800
No, Bravo, Bravo is somehow gayer than Logo still.

20:07.800 --> 20:09.400
I mean, honestly, fucking A.

20:09.400 --> 20:13.800
Project Runway is like the equivalent of an all-male gangbang.

20:13.800 --> 20:18.200
I don't know if you've ever watched this show, Project Runway.

20:18.200 --> 20:20.720
It's gay.

20:20.720 --> 20:25.880
It's like ten Madonna videos, all back to back is what Project Runway is, it is gay.

20:25.880 --> 20:31.520
Every guy on that show is gay, it's gay, gay, gay-y, gay.

20:31.520 --> 20:35.360
But since I'm gay I can say that because it's like that episode of South Park where Mr.

20:35.360 --> 20:39.760
Garrison goes around and calls everybody a fag because he's gay, that's where I can get

20:39.760 --> 20:48.320
away saying that too. Anyway, we should start a show. Usually we like to start the show

20:48.320 --> 20:52.240
by playing a little bit of How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day, where we go around and find

20:52.240 --> 20:56.840
out from everybody, how was your week, how was your day, because not only do we not really

20:56.840 --> 21:00.920
talk about DER, even though we claim that's what our show's about, but the show, if you

21:00.920 --> 21:06.280
think about what the show is really, really about at its core, it's about us and our lives.

21:06.280 --> 21:07.880
about stoking the ego.

21:07.880 --> 21:08.880
That's exactly right.

21:08.880 --> 21:12.200
So, uh, DarkSakura, if your microphone will cooperate with you through this segment, how

21:12.200 --> 21:14.200
was your week, how was your day?

21:14.200 --> 21:17.680
Well, actually, how was the past two weeks?

21:17.680 --> 21:18.680
That's true.

21:18.680 --> 21:19.680
Excuse me.

21:19.680 --> 21:23.720
I ate a burrito, and burritos make me burp.

21:23.720 --> 21:26.720
I'm also drinking TAB.

21:26.720 --> 21:27.720
TAB is like the ultimate drink of me.

21:27.720 --> 21:31.400
Why the fuck are you voluntarily drinking TAB?

21:31.400 --> 21:34.640
Because the 80s are making a comeback and not in a good way.

21:34.640 --> 21:41.520
if I if I was on like survivor and they offered tab and a reward challenge I'd

21:41.520 --> 21:46.400
be all fuck you I'll starve seriously I'll drink sand thank you I would

21:46.400 --> 21:52.680
honestly rather drink ocean water that all the fish have crapped in the tap

21:52.680 --> 22:01.360
but the tab is tabulous fantabulous you know tab backwards is bad and that's

22:01.360 --> 22:04.120
That's exactly what it tastes like, blended bat.

22:04.120 --> 22:05.120
Rob.

22:05.120 --> 22:06.120
What?

22:06.120 --> 22:07.120
Dear.

22:07.120 --> 22:08.120
Yes.

22:08.120 --> 22:09.120
Your analogy sucked ass.

22:09.120 --> 22:10.120
I know.

22:10.120 --> 22:13.440
I'm trying to compete with Loki tonight in the analogy department.

22:13.440 --> 22:21.000
I just got an I.M. that says you're drinking tab.

22:21.000 --> 22:22.000
Yes.

22:22.000 --> 22:23.000
That's right.

22:23.000 --> 22:24.000
You get her.

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
That's almost as bad.

22:25.000 --> 22:26.000
What was that?

22:26.000 --> 22:27.000
Tang or?

22:27.000 --> 22:29.660
by the Tang or...

22:29.660 --> 22:31.720
Did you get the astronauts took to the moon?

22:31.720 --> 22:37.680
Notice how Tab was conspicuously left out of all three

22:37.680 --> 22:41.080
I love the 80's series on VH1. You know why?

22:41.080 --> 22:45.200
Because no one loved Tab. No one loved Tab at all.

22:45.200 --> 22:51.000
I love Tab. It tastes like gross but I like it. You know what's sad is I woke up this morning...

22:51.000 --> 22:52.780
I woke up this morning... Hey!

22:52.780 --> 22:54.000
What about my week?

22:54.000 --> 22:58.240
Well, we were on the tangent of I Love the 80s, so I was saying, I woke up this morning

22:58.240 --> 23:03.920
and I was wondering, how long after it becomes, you know, 2011 will it take VH1 to make the

23:03.920 --> 23:06.440
I Love 2000?

23:06.440 --> 23:07.440
I was just like...

23:07.440 --> 23:08.440
Well, we already have it.

23:08.440 --> 23:09.800
It's that show, Best Week Ever.

23:09.800 --> 23:13.520
I don't know if you've watched Best Week Ever, but it's basically I Love the Last Week.

23:13.520 --> 23:15.760
It's the premise of the show.

23:15.760 --> 23:16.760
I Love the Last Week.

23:16.760 --> 23:20.440
But you know the drink that we need to have come back besides Crystal Pepsi and Josta?

23:20.440 --> 23:23.600
Because Josta was the drink, and Serge...

23:23.600 --> 23:29.200
If you say, if you say Pepsi Blue, I'm leaving the show, because I cannot stand Pepsi Blue.

23:29.200 --> 23:31.200
It is so blue, too.

23:31.200 --> 23:32.200
Pepsi Blue.

23:32.200 --> 23:36.760
But Tab makes me think of Back to the Future, where he goes into the bar, into the little

23:36.760 --> 23:38.920
diner and says, give me a tab.

23:38.920 --> 23:40.200
You haven't ordered anything yet.

23:40.200 --> 23:41.200
You can't have a tab.

23:41.200 --> 23:42.200
Okay.

23:42.200 --> 23:43.200
Then a Pepsi Free.

23:43.200 --> 23:47.360
Look, if you're going to get, have a Pepsi, you have to pay for it.

23:47.360 --> 23:50.480
Ha ha.

23:50.480 --> 23:53.080
The only thing I can think of that's worse than TAB is Pepsi Blue.

23:53.080 --> 23:54.080
Nasty.

23:54.080 --> 23:58.080
Like, if that were the reward on Survivor, I'd swish it and spit it at the host.

23:58.080 --> 23:59.080
This is not awful.

23:59.080 --> 24:00.080
Pepsi Blue is god-awful.

24:00.080 --> 24:01.080
Dr. Pepper.

24:01.080 --> 24:02.080
Isn't it?

24:02.080 --> 24:03.080
Doesn't the vanilla Dr. Pepper?

24:03.080 --> 24:04.080
Ew!

24:04.080 --> 24:05.080
Ew!

24:05.080 --> 24:07.680
The Cherry Vanilla Dr. Pepper is the nastiest shit ever.

24:07.680 --> 24:08.680
Okay.

24:08.680 --> 24:15.800
I don't know when we started becoming the soft drink show, but I have to say this.

24:15.800 --> 24:19.780
This friend of mine made the best analogy about that diet Cherry Vanilla Dr. Pepper.

24:19.780 --> 24:23.220
It doesn't taste like cherry, and it doesn't taste like vanilla, and it really doesn't

24:23.220 --> 24:25.020
taste like Dr. Pepper.

24:25.020 --> 24:28.560
I don't know what that's supposed to be.

24:28.560 --> 24:32.540
It's like all three of the flavors cancel each other out, and suddenly you've got like

24:32.540 --> 24:33.540
TAB.

24:33.540 --> 24:34.540
Anyway.

24:34.540 --> 24:38.260
Raj just told me that Blue Pepsi tasted like medicine.

24:38.260 --> 24:40.580
I would rather drink a bottle of DayQuil.

24:40.580 --> 24:42.200
I said it looked like a toilet bowl.

24:42.200 --> 24:43.420
I liked Blue Pepsi.

24:43.420 --> 24:44.420
Oh my God.

24:44.420 --> 24:45.420
Am I weird?

24:45.420 --> 24:46.420
Go kill yourself.

24:46.420 --> 24:47.420
Okay.

24:47.420 --> 24:56.260
was eventful. I got to stay on a bus and go to San Francisco on a bus for my

24:56.260 --> 25:02.060
field trip last Sunday and I just sort of played with my puppies on the way and

25:02.060 --> 25:07.100
ignored the teacher. But he was giving us a history of different locations on the

25:07.100 --> 25:10.980
way in San Francisco and everything and it was kind of cool. Wait a minute, wait a

25:10.980 --> 25:15.820
minute. But we hardly got out of the bus. Hold up, hold up. The last time I went on a

25:15.820 --> 25:22.380
a field trip. I was in the 11th grade. I did not know that they did field trips in college.

25:22.380 --> 25:25.700
What? What? I've never... They also do camping trips for like single

25:25.700 --> 25:29.080
credits and everything. The hell?

25:29.080 --> 25:32.020
If you can take bowling as a sport, they have field trips.

25:32.020 --> 25:35.980
This is for cultural geography. So we went over the different settlements and we went

25:35.980 --> 25:41.140
by the first mission in San Francisco. And we also, though, went by... This is my favorite

25:41.140 --> 25:45.580
place and I've always wanted to get out and go there. It's by the Exploratorium.

25:45.580 --> 25:49.960
The Palace of Fine Art that was there since the World's Fair in 1915.

25:49.960 --> 25:54.000
The last standing structure from the World's Fair in 1915.

25:54.000 --> 25:59.440
And just listening to how most of San Francisco is built on landfill.

25:59.440 --> 26:02.800
Like oh, we have an earthquake, let's just use all this crap to fill up a lake and build

26:02.800 --> 26:07.800
houses on it. Without any real engineering, really makes me want to live in San Francisco.

26:07.800 --> 26:08.800
Yeah, right.

26:08.800 --> 26:09.800
Right.

26:09.800 --> 26:10.800
Did you go to the Exploratorium also?

26:10.800 --> 26:11.800
No, we didn't.

26:11.800 --> 26:12.800
Oh.

26:12.800 --> 26:13.800
We used their bathroom twice.

26:13.800 --> 26:14.800
Oh.

26:14.800 --> 26:15.800
I like the Exploratorium.

26:15.800 --> 26:16.800
I do, too.

26:16.800 --> 26:17.800
Yeah.

26:17.800 --> 26:20.720
I liked it at the very, very back where nobody really went, and you know how you have that

26:20.720 --> 26:25.620
big screen where if you dance in front of it, you can see yourself like a silhouette

26:25.620 --> 26:28.960
of yourself on the screen dancing, and it changes all sorts of colors.

26:28.960 --> 26:29.960
You know what I'm talking about?

26:29.960 --> 26:30.960
They have a place like that in Mobile.

26:30.960 --> 26:31.960
It's actually just called the Explorium.

26:31.960 --> 26:32.960
Oh, really?

26:32.960 --> 26:36.600
It's in downtown Mobile built out of, I think, the old city hall, but they have a screen

26:36.600 --> 26:37.600
like that.

26:37.600 --> 26:38.600
It was great.

26:38.600 --> 26:46.160
They still have animatronic dinosaurs there too.

26:46.160 --> 26:49.480
So on the way back on the field trip, did you guys sing songs on the bus?

26:49.480 --> 26:53.120
Found a peanut, found a peanut, found a peanut.

26:53.120 --> 26:54.120
Actually, no.

26:54.120 --> 26:58.480
This is the first time in my life, normally if you go look at the Golden Gate, if it's

26:58.480 --> 27:02.120
foggy you can still see the top of the tallest bit of it.

27:02.120 --> 27:04.760
It was completely engulfed in fog this time.

27:04.760 --> 27:05.760
Completely.

27:05.760 --> 27:09.760
I took pictures. I can put them somewhere for people, I guess.

27:09.760 --> 27:13.760
But yeah, that's what I did on Sunday. The rest of my week has just been

27:13.760 --> 27:17.760
working school and going to the chiropractor. My

27:17.760 --> 27:21.760
insurance paid for me one of those exercise balls.

27:21.760 --> 27:25.760
So I've been using it.

27:25.760 --> 27:29.760
My husband's going on South Beach next week, so I'm going back

27:29.760 --> 27:33.760
to phase one on it with him. So you're going to be hearing me next week going,

27:33.760 --> 27:39.800
hungry I need a burrito I'll be sitting here eating Pizza Hut mmm actually I can

27:39.800 --> 27:43.240
eat California Pizza Kitchen Tanya because they don't bleach their flour

27:43.240 --> 27:51.600
that's some good stuff I respect you but um but and at any rate it's like I was

27:51.600 --> 27:57.240
so worn out that day that when we got onto the Bay Bridge to go back I opened

27:57.240 --> 28:08.400
my eyes again in Vallejo so yeah I was pretty much dead and really the rest of

28:08.400 --> 28:13.840
my week has just been crap well we did watch Batman Begins again and I sprained

28:13.840 --> 28:25.480
my wrist. Wait a minute how did you sprain your wrist watching Batman Begins? I was drinking and I got up off the floor.

28:25.480 --> 28:28.680
Christian Bale do it for you?

28:28.680 --> 28:31.320
Well actually, in that movie, yeah.

28:31.320 --> 28:38.040
But no, I was getting up off the floor and I pushed my hand down and hyper-extended my wrist.

28:38.040 --> 28:42.160
Were you going to show them the bat cave?

28:42.160 --> 28:46.280
Listeners, I'm going to give you a play-by-play of me winding up this

28:46.280 --> 28:47.920
game from Chipotle and

28:47.920 --> 28:50.360
throwing it at Robin, hitting him in the face.

28:50.360 --> 28:54.080
Which I just did.

28:54.080 --> 28:56.080
Naughty naughty boy!

29:24.080 --> 29:28.080
I was gonna play a video game, but, uh, yeah. I wanna go eat instead.

29:28.080 --> 29:30.080
Well, it was good.

29:30.080 --> 29:34.080
And, um, we ended up, we were gonna watch, uh, Dan was watching The Job.

29:34.080 --> 29:38.080
It has Dennis Leary. I hate that show, but I love Dennis Leary.

29:38.080 --> 29:42.080
I, like, I loathe just about every character on that show.

29:42.080 --> 29:47.080
The last thing that I liked that I loathed every character on was, like, Chicago.

29:47.080 --> 29:49.080
But that's it.

29:49.080 --> 29:54.080
I'm done since you've not wasted all my time talking about stuff.

29:54.080 --> 29:57.080
You know you love it. That's what we do.

29:57.080 --> 29:58.080
Oh, baby.

29:58.080 --> 30:00.080
Loki, how was your week? How was your day?

30:00.080 --> 30:05.080
Well, my week was weird, and my day was weird.

30:05.080 --> 30:09.080
The entire week was filled up with two things, and it's really strange.

30:09.080 --> 30:15.080
Myself playing the game The Warriors and watching the first season of Desperate Housewives.

30:15.080 --> 30:21.080
and I don't know how those two combined but that's I don't get it dude you

30:21.080 --> 30:24.220
actually sat through the whole first season of Desperate Housewives not

30:24.220 --> 30:28.020
voluntarily Nellie was watching Desperate Housewives I was programming the

30:28.020 --> 30:32.520
web page so I think in a sense I did sit through the whole you know first season

30:32.520 --> 30:39.880
of Desperate Housewives I don't know it's I have breaking news what I just

30:39.880 --> 30:44.280
found two dollars in my pocket congratulations that's your payment for

30:44.280 --> 30:49.620
doing this show for the past three and a half years someone actually sent me a

30:49.620 --> 30:55.440
dollar you know how in the intro it says give her a dollar yeah someone actually

30:55.440 --> 31:02.740
mailed me a dollar you gave somebody your address anyway okay listening to

31:02.740 --> 31:07.380
this show and he mailed me a dollar awesome dude we're gonna be rich doing

31:07.380 --> 31:10.980
this program get all the listeners to send us a dollar then we'd have like

31:40.980 --> 31:44.820
can identify with. You know, they have the four different type of women and stuff like

31:44.820 --> 31:52.420
that. So, I don't know. It's not a bad show. It's well-written, I guess, but not exactly

31:52.420 --> 31:58.980
something that, you know, most heterosexual males would be caught dead watching. You know,

31:58.980 --> 32:04.660
I don't know. It had, for me, it had the same feel as, like, Dead Like Me and Wonder Falls.

32:04.660 --> 32:07.580
You know, the same type of thing, where each show has, like, a theme to it, that type of

32:07.580 --> 32:08.580
thing.

32:08.580 --> 32:10.580
And if we're missing out, those two shows are great.

32:10.580 --> 32:15.580
So, hey, that's what it... I mean, I've got the DVD set, got it for free, thank God, I didn't pay for it.

32:15.580 --> 32:20.580
So yeah, guess what's up next? I have to watch season one of Lost now.

32:20.580 --> 32:23.580
I really don't want to sit through that, so, but, whatever.

32:23.580 --> 32:28.580
Anyways, um, so yeah, it's been that, working on the webpage, playing the Warriors,

32:28.580 --> 32:33.580
and not getting to play any other games I wanted to play because, you know, the TV's being taken up.

32:33.580 --> 32:37.580
So, what did you, um, do for the website?

32:37.580 --> 32:47.580
I created a wonderful kick-ass shoutbox for our PSP site with a nice virtual keyboard on there and everything. It looks pretty.

32:47.580 --> 32:56.580
Yeah, so you can go there and give us a shoutout over on OLRPSP.com, but again, that website is really for viewing on your PSP.

32:56.580 --> 32:59.580
It'll work in a normal browser, but it looks ugly.

32:59.580 --> 33:01.580
It doesn't look as pretty, let's put it that way.

33:01.580 --> 33:07.580
It is still pretty, but it's prettier if you look at it on a PSP, because it's made for the PSP.

33:07.580 --> 33:11.580
In fact, it looks better than our regular website, I gotta say.

33:11.580 --> 33:13.580
Oh well.

33:13.580 --> 33:15.580
That's alright, what can you do?

33:15.580 --> 33:18.580
But yeah, that's pretty much what I've been doing this week.

33:18.580 --> 33:25.580
Just lots of work, and trying to put some video games in there.

33:25.580 --> 33:28.580
Play Grand Theft Auto Liberty Sea Stories for all five minutes.

33:28.580 --> 33:31.580
It's about all the attention that I can dedicate to that game.

33:31.580 --> 33:32.580
Is it that bad?

33:32.580 --> 33:34.580
No, I just can't dedicate enough attention to the game.

33:34.580 --> 33:35.580
Too busy watching Desperate Housewives?

33:35.580 --> 33:36.580
I'm too busy doing every-

33:36.580 --> 33:37.580
Too bad?

33:37.580 --> 33:38.580
Like, tons of stuff.

33:38.580 --> 33:39.580
And, I don't know.

33:39.580 --> 33:43.580
Liberty City Stories, it's like, I don't even have time for most of the stuff on the PSP,

33:43.580 --> 33:46.580
so, I don't know.

33:46.580 --> 33:48.580
It'll be fun playing multiplayer, though.

33:48.580 --> 33:49.580
Alright, I'm done.

33:49.580 --> 33:50.580
Alright.

33:50.580 --> 33:53.580
Uh, I guess I'll talk about my week real fast, then we'll get to our guests,

33:53.580 --> 33:54.580
and they can talk about their week.

33:54.580 --> 34:02.580
My week was okay. It was actually really busy, because I had an awful lot of work stuff this week, and I was even there one night until like 7 o'clock, and that's just sad.

34:02.580 --> 34:08.580
So I haven't really gotten a chance to do a whole lot else. I did buy some new games, and I'll talk about those on this week's podcast.

34:08.580 --> 34:15.580
Soul Calibur 3 I've been playing an awful lot of, as well as Midway Arcade Treasures 3, which Loki gave me last week.

34:15.580 --> 34:21.580
And I started playing Taito, but I'm going to save that for the week after podcast, because I didn't get to play it really enough.

34:21.580 --> 34:26.860
really enough so I'm gonna talk about those games and not a whole lot else

34:26.860 --> 34:32.080
really you know I didn't do a lot for Halloween which is kind of even though

34:32.080 --> 34:35.180
Halloween's technically tomorrow I've really done a lot for Halloween which is

34:35.180 --> 34:38.980
kind of too bad except playing World of Warcraft and trick-or-treating inside

34:38.980 --> 34:42.720
World of Warcraft which is really nerdy but I haven't done a whole lot for

34:42.720 --> 34:48.220
Halloween which is sad because I remember when Halloween was cool otherwise

34:48.220 --> 34:51.320
I hung out with some friends I went up to Chico Friday night Chico's a small

34:51.320 --> 34:56.300
little town. You know, our show's based in Sacramento, California. Chico's a town about

34:56.300 --> 35:00.640
90 minutes north of here, and it's one of those towns where the college pretty much

35:00.640 --> 35:05.880
runs the town, so, you know, like the keg is the national flower and stuff in Chico.

35:05.880 --> 35:11.880
So it was good times, though. Good times. You know, just did a little bit of drinking.

35:11.880 --> 35:15.600
We drank butter beer, like Harry Potter. You know how they had the butter beer? We drank

35:15.600 --> 35:18.000
butter beer. You know what they put in butter beer?

35:18.000 --> 35:19.000
What is that?

35:19.000 --> 35:22.400
Shnops, root beer, and vodka.

35:22.400 --> 35:26.280
You know, when we went to the party last year, the one

35:26.280 --> 35:30.640
that Rice Princess threw, we had the butter beer there,

35:30.640 --> 35:32.840
and it was actually really good.

35:32.840 --> 35:34.200
Everything there was really good,

35:34.200 --> 35:38.440
and then I got sick and put in the hospital the next day.

35:38.440 --> 35:40.320
But I mean, the food was great.

35:40.320 --> 35:41.200
That's not funny.

35:41.200 --> 35:43.160
No, no, the food didn't make me sick, though.

35:43.160 --> 35:43.960
Oh, that's right.

35:43.960 --> 35:46.960
Didn't we all suspect at first that Irene had poisoned you

35:46.960 --> 35:47.600
or something?

35:47.600 --> 35:48.320
Oh, no.

35:48.320 --> 35:50.720
Irene's food had killed you somehow?

35:50.720 --> 35:51.720
She killed me?

35:51.720 --> 35:56.480
No, I didn't die, so, you know, I'm a trooper.

35:56.480 --> 36:01.160
Little known fact about Extrofer, he had two major surgeries last year.

36:01.160 --> 36:02.880
I did have two major surgeries last year.

36:02.880 --> 36:05.000
Maybe he didn't want me to say that on the show, but...

36:05.000 --> 36:09.240
Well, no, it's okay, you know, to say that.

36:09.240 --> 36:10.240
Fine with it.

36:10.240 --> 36:12.280
I'm over it, you know.

36:12.280 --> 36:13.280
Extrofer's been cut up.

36:13.280 --> 36:15.800
I have been cut up.

36:15.800 --> 36:18.000
You know, lost a gallbladder, lost an appendix.

36:18.000 --> 36:22.640
I'm 10% less Christopher than you saw before that.

36:22.640 --> 36:24.960
I have room in me to stuff things.

36:24.960 --> 36:25.960
Good.

36:25.960 --> 36:29.800
You'll need that, like cocaine and stuff.

36:29.800 --> 36:30.800
So is it my turn?

36:30.800 --> 36:31.800
Yeah.

36:31.800 --> 36:32.800
How was your week?

36:32.800 --> 36:33.800
How was your day?

36:33.800 --> 36:34.800
Okay.

36:34.800 --> 36:40.620
Well, while Loki was getting in touch with his feminine side, I was doing my show on

36:40.620 --> 36:47.880
Monday and I had a really good turnout, lots of listeners, 14 listeners, which was really

36:47.880 --> 36:55.920
good and I enjoyed it and I can't wait to do it again tomorrow and stuff.

36:55.920 --> 37:03.800
And also I played an ass-load of World of Warcraft this week, also I know it's almost

37:03.800 --> 37:07.640
too sad to really talk about.

37:07.640 --> 37:14.680
Yesterday I went to a movie, which I guess I'll get to later on in the show.

37:14.680 --> 37:18.720
Let's just say I saw a movie with my sister.

37:18.720 --> 37:24.520
My sister saw it too, okay?

37:24.520 --> 37:31.660
So, you may want to look forward to my movie review later on.

37:31.660 --> 37:32.660
It'll be spectabulous.

37:32.660 --> 37:37.180
All right.

37:37.180 --> 37:38.900
Like it'll be tabulous.

37:38.900 --> 37:39.900
Like tab.

37:39.900 --> 37:40.900
Give the microphone to Angel.

37:40.900 --> 37:41.900
Okay.

37:41.900 --> 37:42.900
There you go.

37:42.900 --> 37:43.900
Angel, how was your week?

37:43.900 --> 37:53.900
Oh, um, well, pretty good, um, had a lot of stuff to do at, uh, school and stuff like

37:53.900 --> 38:00.420
that, but then other than that, it was, oh dear, what's going on over there?

38:00.420 --> 38:02.420
Come on, spill it!

38:02.420 --> 38:10.620
Jamie, Jamie allows herself to get tied up with chatting with our chatters at orange.google.com,

38:10.620 --> 38:16.120
I really don't want to know what that is.

38:16.120 --> 38:17.120
Did you paste that in chat?

38:17.120 --> 38:18.120
Yes I did.

38:18.120 --> 38:21.120
It's a birthday cake with a giant cock on it, basically.

38:21.120 --> 38:23.120
It has piercings with a cock right here.

38:23.120 --> 38:27.120
I'm not talking about a chicken.

38:27.120 --> 38:31.120
You know, nice that she did that right when I have them.

38:31.120 --> 38:32.120
It's horrible.

38:32.120 --> 38:34.120
That's not fair!

38:34.120 --> 38:37.120
It's balls look diseased or something.

38:37.120 --> 38:41.120
I mean, the balls look like couches. I mean, seriously.

38:41.120 --> 38:43.120
Anyway, Angel, please continue.

38:43.120 --> 38:45.120
I'm sorry, Angel.

38:45.120 --> 38:49.120
Now I forgot what I was saying. Damn it. Damn it. Okay.

38:49.120 --> 38:53.120
Well, yeah. I had a lot of school stuff to do, but then other than that, it was pretty much

38:53.120 --> 38:56.120
gearing up for BlizzCon, even though I didn't really go.

38:56.120 --> 39:00.120
But I know a lot of stuff now, after the fact.

39:00.120 --> 39:02.120
We can get to that later if you wish.

39:02.120 --> 39:03.120
Sure.

39:03.120 --> 39:10.120
a lot of stuff to talk about. I played a lot of World of Warcraft. I shouldn't have played

39:10.120 --> 39:15.120
it and it was fun. All the cool kids play World of Warcraft now.

39:15.120 --> 39:20.120
I'm going to pull an extrovert here. When we talk about World of Warcraft, you know,

39:20.120 --> 39:26.120
the fact that we're going to be bringing it up, it might have your ears burning. And then

39:26.120 --> 39:30.120
we'll be on a crusade later to tell you all the latest information.

39:30.120 --> 39:40.360
I bet it was interesting to see oh wait I mean oh never mind shut up sorry I do

39:40.360 --> 39:48.800
oh and um not that I ever talk about that other game called there but um I

39:48.800 --> 39:54.880
kind of got nominated for like this big um council thing where like you work

40:03.360 --> 40:09.240
yes so greatly so it's a council you do stuff with other people

40:09.240 --> 40:10.640

40:21.480 --> 40:24.780
uh... after work with like the dean and

40:24.780 --> 40:27.340

you working with staff and fifteen of your other community members to

40:44.580 --> 40:50.020
do like NDA stuff and, you know, for the game and develop things. NDA leads to

40:50.020 --> 40:52.820
lawsuits. Oh dear God.

40:52.820 --> 40:54.820
Someone kill Rob now!

40:54.820 --> 40:56.340

41:23.740 --> 41:28.220
We should have had like a show or something where you know we just watch a movie and all

41:28.220 --> 41:30.020
it is is just our reactions to it.

41:30.020 --> 41:35.300

42:11.860 --> 42:13.800
the burning crusade

42:13.800 --> 42:15.100

42:15.100 --> 42:19.120

Fuckin' big ol'

Close your eyes, close your eyes and let it fly

47:00.360 --> 47:07.360
You and I, together we can touch the sky

47:08.360 --> 47:11.360
I was walking down the street

47:11.360 --> 47:15.360
You came like the summer breeze

47:15.360 --> 47:18.360
Sweeping my breath away

47:18.360 --> 47:22.360
It doesn't happen every day

47:22.360 --> 47:25.360
You and I together in the sky

Forever young we can never try

50:27.840 --> 50:29.840
From the best part of Orange House

50:29.840 --> 50:31.840
This media sucks!

50:31.840 --> 50:33.840
All over the world!

50:33.840 --> 50:35.840
We want our servers!

50:35.840 --> 50:37.840
That's right! P.S.!

50:37.840 --> 50:39.840
DTPO

50:39.840 --> 50:41.840
Hi welcome back kids

50:41.840 --> 50:43.840
We're on Orange Lounge Radio

50:43.840 --> 50:45.840
Here again, another week

50:45.840 --> 50:47.840
Another Sunday, another show

50:47.840 --> 50:49.840
Our 162nd show

50:49.840 --> 50:51.840
If you can believe it

50:51.840 --> 50:53.840
God I'm old!

50:53.840 --> 50:55.840
No, just kidding. Not counting the half shows

50:55.840 --> 50:57.840
Yes, very true

50:57.840 --> 50:59.840
That's true, that's true. We did have a couple half shows.

50:59.840 --> 51:02.840
I'm old as far as shows. Yeah.

51:02.840 --> 51:04.840
We've been here since, what, like show 27?

51:04.840 --> 51:05.840
37.

51:05.840 --> 51:06.840
37? I thought it was 27.

51:06.840 --> 51:08.840
No. Oh, wait.

51:08.840 --> 51:10.840
Oh well. Oh, a long time.

51:10.840 --> 51:12.840
27. Sorry.

51:12.840 --> 51:16.840
Um, again, ever since, you know, god, when did we start doing the podcast?

51:16.840 --> 51:20.840
It was January this year, so it was like around 110 or so in show numbers.

51:20.840 --> 51:24.840
No, I just, no, not that, I guess it would be sooner than that, about 120, 130.

51:24.840 --> 51:27.440
It was when we really started getting a lot of new people.

51:27.440 --> 51:28.440
Gee, I wonder why.

51:28.440 --> 51:29.440
But that's cool.

51:29.440 --> 51:33.560
No, we love the fact that people give a crap about us.

51:33.560 --> 51:34.880
It's a very nice feeling.

51:34.880 --> 51:39.240
Anyway, we give a crap about you, too, so we want you to have a chance to give back

51:39.240 --> 51:40.640
to the show.

51:40.640 --> 51:46.080
And you can do that by calling into our Skype line, which we're going to open up very soon

51:46.080 --> 51:50.340
after we talk about the other couple topics here.

51:50.340 --> 51:53.760
And also, we just announced this last week, so some of you guys might have missed this,

51:53.760 --> 52:00.340
now, not only can you call in over the Skype line by calling our username at OrangeLawnsRadio,

52:00.340 --> 52:05.940
but you can actually call us on the phone, 916-226-9067 is the OrangeLawnsRadio number,

52:05.940 --> 52:11.020
so you'll be able to call into that very soon. So, very cool. You missed that, Jamie, that

52:11.020 --> 52:16.420
was last week. We have an actual number now. Wow! So we can get even more people calling

52:16.420 --> 52:25.460
in and telling us to go fuck ourselves, um, anyway, anyway, 916-226-9067, don't call yet,

52:25.460 --> 52:32.580
we're not answering, um, let's see, we also have our chat room going on, www.orangehonortrader.com,

52:32.580 --> 52:37.860
click on chat and you can see, um, all these folks chatting, including, um, Dirty Thief,

52:37.860 --> 52:43.460
who keeps wanting to get me to say his name, so there you have it, I said it. Now I'd have

52:43.460 --> 52:48.580
Now I'm going to have to go through and say everybody's name, but maybe another time.

52:48.580 --> 52:50.220
For now, I want to talk about Ultramix 3.

52:50.220 --> 52:54.220
Dance Dance Revolution Ultramix 3 is on its way out, and they've been taking it out on

52:54.220 --> 52:55.220
tour.

52:55.220 --> 52:58.860
I don't know if you guys heard about the Konami tour, but Konami's going around and touring

52:58.860 --> 53:04.420
the nation right now, and when I say nation, I mean a couple of select states.

53:04.420 --> 53:08.120
They already did the ones in California, but neglected to tell anybody that it was going

53:08.120 --> 53:12.500
on in the DDR community, so none of us thought to go out, but it was in Southern California

53:12.500 --> 53:17.660
So, we here at OLR wouldn't have been able to go, but right now, this past weekend, they

53:17.660 --> 53:21.900
have been in Texas, and they were in Texas today, and that's the last opportunity to

53:21.900 --> 53:22.900
catch them in Texas.

53:22.900 --> 53:29.020
However, they're going to go to Illinois over November 4th, 5th, and 6th, and then they'll

53:29.020 --> 53:34.760
be in Massachusetts, 11th, 12th, and 13th, and then the New York, New Jersey area, mostly

53:34.760 --> 53:38.940
New Jersey, 18th, 19th, and 20th of November.

53:38.940 --> 53:42.220
So if you want to check out the exact locations, we've got them posted on our site, orange

53:42.220 --> 53:45.940
orangeonsradio.com, just look for the little story about the Mall Tour and click Read More.

53:45.940 --> 53:52.560
Now because of the Mall Tour, people have been getting to play final builds of the game

53:52.560 --> 53:54.680
and came back to report a song list.

53:54.680 --> 53:59.260
And so the song list is also posted on our website, www.orangeonsradio.com.

53:59.260 --> 54:03.440
I guess I'll go ahead and read through the song list here, where basically people have

54:03.440 --> 54:09.660
put together, based on the song names, because what somebody did on DDR Freak is they went

54:09.660 --> 54:13.580
to the tour and just wrote down all the names, but they neglected to write down all the artists,

54:13.580 --> 54:17.660
so they've kind of just been piecing it together which artists go with which songs.

54:17.660 --> 54:22.060
So we know about Akumaju Dracula Medli. This group, Blackalicious, has a song called

54:22.060 --> 54:27.620
Alphabet Aerobics, which should be very interesting. I think I actually might have a copy of it

54:27.620 --> 54:30.820
on my machine somewhere. I'm going to have to take a look.

54:30.820 --> 54:36.080
Bag by Revenge, of course, from DDRXtreme. By La Lacquia Carried with When, the Johnny

54:36.080 --> 54:42.420
and S.P.E.S.H. mix, we already knew about that one, Orifiz with Basile, No FX with Bath

54:42.420 --> 54:44.180
of Least Resistance.

54:44.180 --> 54:45.180
That's going to be interesting.

54:45.180 --> 54:46.180
No FX.

54:46.180 --> 54:47.180
That's going to be interesting.

54:47.180 --> 54:52.460
Moby with Body Rock, B4U with Breakdown, the new Naoki song Brilliant Red, Old School with

54:52.460 --> 54:57.660
Butterfly by Smile Decay, Candy Star by Love Unlimited, Carnival Day, which is a crossover

54:57.660 --> 55:03.580
from Guitar Freaks, Polteri and the Fufus, Colors, Midi Head Sapphire mix by DJ Pataka.

55:03.580 --> 55:06.020
There's two songs called Come With Me.

55:06.020 --> 55:09.120
One of them we know is the Rain Dancer version from the v-rare, we don't know what the other

55:09.120 --> 55:10.120
one is.

55:10.120 --> 55:14.940
Conflict, the Turmoil Mix by the Izoic, Crazy in Love, which is the Karaoke Revolution crossover

55:14.940 --> 55:21.900
that was also in Extreme 2, Daikonkai, also in Extreme 2, Dansa Da Yuka by Big Idea,

55:21.900 --> 55:23.660
which I believe is on the v-rare?

55:23.660 --> 55:24.660
I can't remember.

55:24.660 --> 55:32.220
Delta 32 is a song by We Don't Know Who, Destiny Lovers, a song from, I think, Extreme?

55:32.220 --> 55:33.220
I think?

55:33.220 --> 55:34.540
It's been all the time.

55:34.540 --> 55:40.460
Drivin' by Naoki, which was in 2DX, Emotion, there's an old school song for you, Emotion

55:40.460 --> 55:48.260
from the club of pens, I believe, Eversnow from Max 2, Firefly by B4U, Frozen Ray, but

55:48.260 --> 55:53.180
it says Dirty Hurts, like it's a remix of Frozen Ray by DJ Taka.

55:53.180 --> 55:56.620
It was the one, it was the one that was on the V-Rare.

55:56.620 --> 55:58.500
Oh, okay.

55:58.500 --> 56:03.420
Hash the Sun by Chetanix, which is also on the V-Rare, Hateful, we don't know who, here's

56:03.420 --> 56:08.420
There's an A-list musical group, Hey Mama, by the Black Eyed Peas.

56:08.420 --> 56:09.420
Interesting.

56:09.420 --> 56:10.420
I'm just glad it's not...

56:10.420 --> 56:11.420
My Humps?

56:11.420 --> 56:12.420
Thank God.

56:12.420 --> 56:18.580
I'm glad they didn't pick that song.

56:18.580 --> 56:22.860
You know, I was going to talk about my friend's funny dance to My Humps.

56:22.860 --> 56:24.660
You know my friend Billy, right?

56:24.660 --> 56:27.180
He got really drunk at the party and started dancing to My Humps.

56:27.180 --> 56:30.340
My Humps, My Humps.

56:30.340 --> 56:31.700
Maybe an Ultramix 4.

56:31.700 --> 56:32.700
No.

56:32.700 --> 56:37.340
on the phone, which we don't know who it's by. It sounds like Erotic, but it's not. That's

56:37.340 --> 56:41.500
not one of their songs. Sex on the Phone is a song by them, but it's not. I Am Gothic

56:41.500 --> 56:46.700
by Spray. Hey, that's the one we announced on Orange on the Radio like weeks ago. Imperfection,

56:46.700 --> 56:52.140
the Taiko Brahe remix by Real Life. Real Life did the song Send Me an Angel like years and

56:52.140 --> 56:55.320
years ago, and they still play it at like the golf clubs and stuff, so it should be

56:55.320 --> 57:02.320
interesting to there and there. A song called Insaner by Joni and Svesh. Interesting. They

57:02.660 --> 57:09.240
might be giants with Istanbul, not Constantinople. Cool! Which maybe we'll play, I'm going to

57:09.240 --> 57:12.320
see which one of these songs. Maybe they just like it better that way. I have some of these

57:12.320 --> 57:16.400
songs so we're going to try and dig them up. They might be giants. I will play Istanbul

57:16.400 --> 57:20.760
if we can play it. What's also great about that too is one of the very first DWI sim

57:20.760 --> 57:27.760
files that was ever out there was Istanbul NonConcept Noble, which is great.

57:50.760 --> 58:02.120
be like a Spanish song or Latino song, like something you would see on MTV Latin or something.

58:02.120 --> 58:10.040
Midnight Frankenstein by Stay Gold Ponyboy. Miracle Moon LED Light Style Mix, Togo Project

58:10.040 --> 58:15.600
featuring Sana. Moment 40 by Moshik. Nari Narian, we don't know who that is. Play That

58:15.600 --> 58:19.640
funky music, which I believe was another crossover, wasn't it?

58:19.640 --> 58:23.040
Play That Funky Music is... No, I'm thinking Pump of the Volley. I'm sorry.

58:23.040 --> 58:26.520
No, that's from Karaoke Revolution. Ah, that's right.

58:26.520 --> 58:31.660
Pope Re to Orange, Rainbow Flyer by DJ Taka, Raise Your Hands by Midi Head,

58:31.660 --> 58:36.480
Rock Lobster by the B-52s, Rocka Billy Willie, we don't know who that's by,

58:36.480 --> 58:40.000
Sakura by Revenge, Spirit of the Hawk, we don't know who that's by,

58:40.000 --> 58:44.240
So Many Times by Godjo, Sold It for a Song by Zonk,

58:44.240 --> 58:49.440
uh... stake out the ultra mix get it the ultra mix by freeze pop

58:49.440 --> 58:51.800

58:54.080 --> 58:56.760
the cat in the moon we don't know that's why

58:56.760 --> 59:00.560
the legend max together and forever by captain jack rest in peace

59:00.560 --> 59:03.320
walk this way by randy and see

59:03.320 --> 59:06.160
well

59:06.160 --> 59:09.360
i know but it's got to be that version right

59:09.360 --> 59:11.840
i don't want to hear the resolving of the one where they did it teamed up with

59:11.840 --> 59:12.840
Aerosmith.

59:12.840 --> 59:13.840
We'll see.

59:13.840 --> 59:18.840
What I Say by Ray Charles question mark?

59:18.840 --> 59:20.760
Yep, it is.

59:20.760 --> 59:22.840
It is Ray Charles.

59:22.840 --> 59:26.160
Mitty had said that Ray Charles was going to be on.

59:26.160 --> 59:32.160
Where's Your Head At by Basement Jax, which is a crossover from the Dancing Sage series.

59:32.160 --> 59:34.520
Whip It by Devo.

59:34.520 --> 59:36.960
Whip It Good.

59:36.960 --> 59:38.360
Wonder if they'll have the video.

59:38.360 --> 59:44.160
club mix by never aka and some crossover tracks from rumble roses and then a mystery track

59:44.160 --> 59:50.520

01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:20.640
I know I have Sold It For A Song by Zonk, so we're going to play a little clip of this.

01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:22.920
This is something you're going to be hearing in DDR UltraMix 3.

01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:23.920
Here's a little clip.

01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:25.920
Sold it for a Song by Zonk

01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:57.920
Having nothing I shouldn't say

01:00:57.920 --> 01:01:03.920
There is nowhere to be found

01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:07.920
So be for too long

01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:11.920
Gotta sit down, sit down and write something

01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:14.920
Told him for a song

01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:19.920
So as to live on, on, on, on, on, on, on

01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:22.920
Told him for a song

01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:26.920
So as to live on, on, on

01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:29.920

01:01:34.900 --> 01:02:01.020
Wow, I have to interrupt this.

01:02:01.020 --> 01:02:04.060
We're playing some clips from UltraMix 3.0, so I have to interrupt this to say that we

01:02:04.060 --> 01:02:05.500
We hit our cap tonight, you guys.

01:02:05.500 --> 01:02:09.820
We have the maximum number of people on stream that we're supposed to be able to hold right

01:02:09.820 --> 01:02:11.760
now for what we're paying for at Live 365.

01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:15.460
So we're going to have to pay more to fit 100 people on stuff now.

01:02:15.460 --> 01:02:18.460
So anyway, good job, you guys.

01:02:18.460 --> 01:02:19.820
That's where we put up the PayPal link.

01:02:19.820 --> 01:02:20.820
I know.

01:02:20.820 --> 01:02:22.660
Yeah, we're going to have to put up the PayPal link now.

01:02:22.660 --> 01:02:25.080
Thank you guys for listening and making us successful.

01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:28.220
If you are on the stream right now, don't disconnect because there are people in the

01:02:28.220 --> 01:02:30.340
chat room that are pissed that they can't get in.

01:02:30.340 --> 01:02:35.300
Anyway, let's go to another clip.

01:02:35.300 --> 01:02:36.300
This is a clip of...

01:02:36.300 --> 01:02:37.300
We've played this on the show before.

01:02:37.300 --> 01:02:38.460
I want to play this for you guys again.

01:02:38.460 --> 01:02:45.460
MIDI head with Raise Your Hands.

01:03:38.460 --> 01:03:56.960
All right, let's do another clip.

01:03:56.960 --> 01:04:02.140
This is a song by Real Life called Imperfection, which is one that we named off as going to

01:04:02.140 --> 01:04:09.140
to be in DDR.

01:04:32.140 --> 01:04:34.140
She loves you so much

01:04:36.140 --> 01:04:38.140
I'm never coming down again

01:04:38.140 --> 01:04:43.140
I'm never coming down again

01:04:43.140 --> 01:04:47.140
I'm never coming down again

01:04:47.140 --> 01:04:50.140
I'm never coming down

01:04:51.140 --> 01:04:56.140
I'm your lover, love is what I like

01:04:56.140 --> 01:05:15.140
This is my imperfection, waiting for your direction

01:05:15.140 --> 01:05:22.140
This is my imperfection, waiting for resurrection

01:05:45.140 --> 01:06:01.060
Alright, that was another clip of a song that's going to be UltraMix 3, Real Life with Imperfection.

01:06:01.060 --> 01:06:03.860
I can't find Istanbul.

01:06:03.860 --> 01:06:06.140
I know I had that song years ago, so I'm going to have to get that.

01:06:06.140 --> 01:06:09.940
We'll play some more clips on some later shows before the game gets out.

01:06:09.940 --> 01:06:10.940
So check it out.

01:06:10.940 --> 01:06:12.940
What do you guys think of this UltraMix 3 song list?

01:06:12.940 --> 01:06:14.820
I'm curious to hear your feedback.

01:06:14.820 --> 01:06:15.620
Dark Sakura.

01:06:15.620 --> 01:06:17.460
Not quite so generic.

01:06:17.460 --> 01:06:19.380
It's very diverse, isn't it?

01:06:19.380 --> 01:06:22.100
They're definitely going for a very diverse,

01:06:22.100 --> 01:06:23.700
diverse listing, aren't they?

01:06:23.700 --> 01:06:29.600
It is very diverse. I like the system that they're so diverse.

01:06:29.600 --> 01:06:33.020
Freaking Ray Charles and no FX

01:06:33.020 --> 01:06:34.660
in the same mix. That's crazy.

01:06:34.660 --> 01:06:36.380
That's pretty cute.

01:06:36.380 --> 01:06:38.340
What do you think, Loki?

01:06:38.340 --> 01:06:42.500
Um, it's pretty cool. I just don't have an Xbox, so...

01:06:42.500 --> 01:06:44.500
We don't have the 360 though, right?

01:06:44.500 --> 01:06:46.500
Yeah, it doesn't mean it's going to work on it.

01:06:46.500 --> 01:06:51.500
Because remember, it's only supporting about 20 games from the launch.

01:06:51.500 --> 01:06:53.500
That might not be one of the 20.

01:06:53.500 --> 01:06:59.500
I would figure it'd be the games that are closest to the launch, but who knows.

01:06:59.500 --> 01:07:04.500
So I'll just have to get it and wait for it to work.

01:07:04.500 --> 01:07:06.500
Okay.

01:07:06.500 --> 01:07:08.500
I'm sure I'll get a copy for free.

01:07:08.500 --> 01:07:15.500
Angel, what do you think of the Ultramix 3 songs there?

01:07:15.500 --> 01:07:20.500
Like you said, pretty diverse. Yeah, I'm looking forward to it. We'll see what happens.

01:07:20.500 --> 01:07:27.500
All right. I like it. I think it's just very diverse. It's going to be a great, great song list.

01:07:27.500 --> 01:07:30.500
Very solid. Looking forward to it. Be good.

01:07:30.500 --> 01:07:37.500
Also, one other thing I want to point out about Ultramix 3 is that also what's been revealed in the demo

01:07:37.500 --> 01:07:41.180
demo is that they're going to have a 0.5 speed.

01:07:41.180 --> 01:07:43.620
So it's like it's going to be able to slow down the arrows.

01:07:43.620 --> 01:07:46.460
So those of you guys that say, max 300 is too fast.

01:07:46.460 --> 01:07:48.700
Well, now you'll have a 0.5 modifier.

01:07:48.700 --> 01:07:51.500
So that's going to be very interesting.

01:07:51.500 --> 01:07:54.060
And also, if you can play bag on 0.5,

01:07:54.060 --> 01:07:57.340
that would be very impressive.

01:07:57.340 --> 01:08:02.260
I know it's been done like on, excuse me,

01:08:02.260 --> 01:08:04.980
I know that that stuff's been done on like step mania

01:08:04.980 --> 01:08:06.900
and stuff, but it's nice to see it acknowledged

01:08:06.900 --> 01:08:16.160
like real BDR so oh yeah what arcade mix had the point five on it wasn't there

01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:20.340
one of the boots or bootlegs or something someone the hacked extreme with

01:08:20.340 --> 01:08:29.200
the point five speed and the wave and break that were in there hmm so you

01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:35.480
could in a sense try doing bag on point five speed break down to the point the

01:08:35.480 --> 01:08:36.480
the end where it's just...

01:08:36.480 --> 01:08:38.120
You just have to memorize the arrows, basically.

01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:39.120
Pretty much, yeah.

01:08:39.120 --> 01:08:41.680
Looks like a big clusterfuck of arrows would be no fun.

01:08:41.680 --> 01:08:42.680
Exactly.

01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:43.680
Alright.

01:08:43.680 --> 01:08:46.840
Alright, well, I think what we'll do now is we'll go ahead and open up the Skype line

01:08:46.840 --> 01:08:51.760
and take your calls, because we want to know what you guys have to say, and your thoughts

01:08:51.760 --> 01:08:52.760
on what's going on.

01:08:52.760 --> 01:08:54.320
And we're already getting a call, so why not?

01:08:54.320 --> 01:08:55.320
Let's go for it.

01:08:55.320 --> 01:08:56.320
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

01:08:56.320 --> 01:08:57.320
Hey, what's up?

01:08:57.320 --> 01:08:58.320
It's Ronma.

01:08:58.320 --> 01:08:59.320
Hey, Ronma, how are you?

01:08:59.320 --> 01:09:00.320
Ronma!

01:09:00.320 --> 01:09:01.320
What?

01:09:01.320 --> 01:09:02.320
What?

01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:03.320
What?

01:09:03.320 --> 01:09:10.680
Yeah, this is the ultimate test of the message line, so I'm currently on the road as we speak.

01:09:10.680 --> 01:09:12.240
You're currently on the road?

01:09:12.240 --> 01:09:14.880
Yeah, I'm coming back to my niece's house.

01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:16.440
I'm on the bus heading back home.

01:09:16.440 --> 01:09:17.440
Oh, right on.

01:09:17.440 --> 01:09:18.440
You know what?

01:09:18.440 --> 01:09:21.480
You might have trouble getting in when you get home because we hit our cap tonight.

01:09:21.480 --> 01:09:22.480
It's crazy.

01:09:22.480 --> 01:09:28.800
We've got all these new listeners tonight, so we're happy, but very too bad that you

01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:34.760
might not be able to get in when you get home when I get home somebody in the

01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:38.240
chat room is actually taping the show so I definitely get a copy yeah I heard

01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:42.960
about our bootleggers we got going on so that's cool we we do it it's flattering

01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:49.080
who said hey I call it syndication underground okay it's all good it's all

01:09:49.080 --> 01:09:52.840

01:09:52.840 --> 01:09:53.940
issue but yeah

01:09:53.940 --> 01:09:56.180
underground cool

01:09:56.180 --> 01:09:57.740
uh...

01:09:57.740 --> 01:09:59.160
anyway all

01:09:59.160 --> 01:10:01.260
i think part of that i want to know

01:10:01.260 --> 01:10:04.220
happy halloween what are you doing really

01:10:04.220 --> 01:10:05.980

01:10:05.980 --> 01:10:09.700
tomorrow just in our total character that's going to enter not parading

01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:18.880

I'm gonna go around reaping my fellow co-workers

01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:31.560
And last night we had a Halloween party out in Queens and let's just say everybody got trashed and

01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:37.800
Let's just say it blows down to this. Whatever happens on Halloween parties stays at a Halloween party

01:10:39.960 --> 01:10:41.960
You have to beat it to understand

01:10:44.680 --> 01:10:46.680
One of those things well

01:10:46.680 --> 01:10:51.680
Um, we gotta kinda keep it short tonight, because we've got a ton of people trying to get in, but, uh, anything else you want to say?

01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:52.680
You got it.

01:10:52.680 --> 01:10:55.680
That's it, and the message line works great, especially when you're out on the road.

01:10:55.680 --> 01:10:57.680
All right, sounds good.

01:10:57.680 --> 01:10:58.680
All right, you guys take care.

01:10:58.680 --> 01:11:00.680
All right, take care, bud. Later.

01:11:00.680 --> 01:11:01.680
You got it. Bye.

01:11:01.680 --> 01:11:05.680
And when he talks about our new message line, of course he's talking about the phone number that you can call in as well.

01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:11.680
916-226-9067 if you want to get through, or you can also give us a call on the old Skype line.

01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:13.680
Let's go to another call.

01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:14.680
I'm gonna pick up this one.

01:11:14.680 --> 01:11:29.300
Hi, you're on Orange

01:11:29.300 --> 01:11:31.300
It's Nintendo Maniac 64.

01:11:31.300 --> 01:11:33.300
Hi Nintendo Maniac 64, why are you pissed?

01:11:33.300 --> 01:11:37.300
Because I can't get into the radio station.

01:11:37.300 --> 01:11:38.300
You know, you're in the...

01:11:38.300 --> 01:11:39.300
The stupid...

01:11:39.300 --> 01:11:42.300
I don't know what to say, we've never been in this situation before.

01:11:42.300 --> 01:11:44.300
We've been on the air... No, one other time we were in this situation.

01:11:44.300 --> 01:11:47.300
We've been on the air for three and a half years now.

01:11:47.300 --> 01:11:49.300
Literally, three and a half years.

01:11:49.300 --> 01:11:52.300
And we've only one other time been this popular.

01:11:52.300 --> 01:11:56.300
And the only reason we had so many people trying to get in that episode

01:11:56.300 --> 01:12:00.300
was because we were playing a brand new Akira Yamaoka song before anybody.

01:12:00.300 --> 01:12:02.300
It was a brand new DDR Akira Yamaoka song.

01:12:02.300 --> 01:12:04.300
It was the URAIN mix in DDR Extreme.

01:12:04.300 --> 01:12:06.800
We played it first, like months before the game came out,

01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:08.800
and that's the only other time we ever hit our cap.

01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:10.300
So this is very odd for us,

01:12:10.300 --> 01:12:12.300
that we're just here doing our normal thing,

01:12:12.300 --> 01:12:14.300
and we're so popular.

01:12:14.300 --> 01:12:18.300
So we really appreciate the support, of course, but it's kind of crazy, so.

01:12:19.300 --> 01:12:22.300
People get pissed.

01:12:22.300 --> 01:12:24.300
What, buddy? You're breaking up a little bit.

01:12:24.300 --> 01:12:25.800
People get pissed.

01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:30.040
Yeah, I'm sorry, we're going to look at what we can do about increasing the cap so we can

01:12:30.040 --> 01:12:35.960
get more listeners in during the show, but for tonight, you guys are a little bit screwed,

01:12:35.960 --> 01:12:39.960
but you know what, go into our chat room at orangelunch.com and click on chat, and there's

01:12:39.960 --> 01:12:46.400
people that can help you catch up on what you missed, so to speak, if you know what

01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:47.400
I mean.

01:12:47.400 --> 01:12:48.400
Yeah.

01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:49.400
Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.

01:12:49.400 --> 01:12:50.400
Yeah.

01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:51.400
All right.

01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:55.040
Anything you want to say, gaming related or related to the show?

01:12:55.040 --> 01:12:58.040
Yeah, uh, you said you got Midway Arcade Treasures 3?

01:12:58.040 --> 01:13:01.040
Uh, run that by me one more time? You broke up a little bit there?

01:13:02.040 --> 01:13:05.040
You said you got Midway Arcade Treasures 3?

01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:07.040
Yes, I got Midway Arcade Treasures 3.

01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:12.040
Cool, I've been trying, like, forever to get that game.

01:13:12.040 --> 01:13:18.040
Really? It's not- I- I got it thanks to Loki, so I didn't try to go out and buy it in the store or anything, so...

01:13:18.040 --> 01:13:20.040
I guess I got kinda lucky.

01:13:20.040 --> 01:13:26.040
Well, not like... I'm not trying to drive, but I mean, like, as soon as I can't drive, yeah, it's so, like...

01:13:26.040 --> 01:13:30.040
Ah, so you can take out your aggressions on Arcade Treasures 3, then, since you can't drive.

01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:35.040
Hello?

01:13:35.040 --> 01:13:40.040
I think we're breaking up, buddy. I think we're breaking up, buddy, so I'm gonna go ahead and let you go for now.

01:13:40.040 --> 01:13:42.040
But thanks for listening, and keep trying to get back in, all right?

01:13:42.040 --> 01:13:43.040
Okay.

01:13:43.940 --> 01:13:46.880
He's a Midway arcade treasures 3 of course is the eight

01:13:48.040 --> 01:13:50.960
Driving games kind of all put in one game

01:13:52.620 --> 01:13:59.520
Classics like hydro thunder and stun runner and my favorite iron man off-road with the track pack as well

01:13:59.520 --> 01:14:02.800
Which I think is awesome, so anyway let's go to another call. Let's go to

01:14:03.740 --> 01:14:05.740
This one hi you're on orange on radio

01:14:08.540 --> 01:14:10.540
Hello you're on orange on radio

01:14:10.540 --> 01:14:14.540
Hello. Hello. Hi.

01:14:14.540 --> 01:14:18.540
Hi, who's this? This is Roz again. Hi Roz, how are you?

01:14:18.540 --> 01:14:22.540
Hi Roz! Hi. What's up?

01:14:22.540 --> 01:14:26.540
Actually I feel really damn great because I had my

01:14:26.540 --> 01:14:30.540
first ever Red Bull today.

01:14:30.540 --> 01:14:34.540
She had her first Red Bull today. Oh shit.

01:14:34.540 --> 01:14:38.540
I remember the first time I drank a Red Bull. It was because I

01:14:38.540 --> 01:14:41.540
staying up really late and I'd been up since like six in the morning and I was

01:14:41.540 --> 01:14:45.920
trying to stay out to go clubbing and I just it was like I was drunk but not

01:14:45.920 --> 01:14:50.120
not really it's a different sensation than being drunk but but Red Bull is the

01:14:50.120 --> 01:14:59.360
color of pee it is it really it looks a lot like it it's why it's in a can not a

01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:03.080
clear bottle so why are you drinking Red Bull tonight are you just drinking it

01:15:03.080 --> 01:15:06.380
for recreational purposes, or?

01:15:06.380 --> 01:15:08.380
Well, I had never had one before.

01:15:08.380 --> 01:15:09.960
And I was going to get bottled water,

01:15:09.960 --> 01:15:12.080
but they were out of it for some reason,

01:15:12.080 --> 01:15:14.600
at the little store place I was at.

01:15:14.600 --> 01:15:18.840
So the other thing that they had that was cold was Red Bull.

01:15:18.840 --> 01:15:23.240
So I just picked one out and decided to drink it today.

01:15:23.240 --> 01:15:26.000
I feel great.

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:27.720
You kind of sound like you're really happy.

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:31.120
I'm just messing with you.

01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:31.700
That's great.

01:15:31.700 --> 01:15:32.880
Damn it.

01:15:32.880 --> 01:15:38.320
The red bill gives you wings because it makes you freaking high.

01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:41.280
Yeah, exactly.

01:15:41.280 --> 01:15:44.000
So anything you want to share about what you've been hearing on the show so far?

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:47.760
Anything going on in your video game world?

01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:49.560
Um...

01:15:49.560 --> 01:15:52.700
Rosling to be the Katamari cake.

01:15:52.700 --> 01:15:57.520
Oh yeah, the Katamari cake. Dude, what is up with all these cakes you guys are

01:15:57.520 --> 01:16:01.640
looking at tonight in chat? So there was the cake with the giant penis on it,

01:16:01.640 --> 01:16:06.000
And now there's the cake that's a katamari, the little prince of the cosmos pushing around

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:07.000
the katamari.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:08.000
That's awesome.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:09.000
I want a cake like that for my birthday.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.960
Yeah, like two years ago I had a kirby cake.

01:16:11.960 --> 01:16:14.920
Oh, that's so cute.

01:16:14.920 --> 01:16:16.680
What was kirby doing on the kirby cake?

01:16:16.680 --> 01:16:19.600
He was just kind of being there.

01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:21.760
Just chilling out saying, hey, I'm a cake.

01:16:21.760 --> 01:16:22.760
In the fridge.

01:16:22.760 --> 01:16:27.840
And I couldn't look in the fridge for like two days because it was supposed to be a surprise.

01:16:27.840 --> 01:16:28.840
Okay.

01:16:28.840 --> 01:16:35.840
Yeah, so I would be like making eggs and I'd have to shut my eyes and I'd end up like sticking my hand in mashed potatoes or something.

01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:38.840
What flavor was Kirby when you ate him?

01:16:38.840 --> 01:16:40.840
Strawberry.

01:16:40.840 --> 01:16:42.840
Awesome. That's a very Kirby flavor.

01:16:42.840 --> 01:16:44.840
Kirby is strawberry.

01:16:44.840 --> 01:16:45.840
Delicious.

01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:51.840
Well, Roz, we're going to go ahead and let you go so we can get to another caller, but thanks so much for calling in and sharing the Kirby cake love with us.

01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:55.840
And enjoy that Red Bull, but please, don't drink and drive.

01:16:55.840 --> 01:16:56.840
Alright?

01:16:56.840 --> 01:16:57.840
Okay.

01:16:57.840 --> 01:16:59.360
Have a good one.

01:16:59.360 --> 01:16:59.860
Bye.

01:16:59.860 --> 01:17:01.440
Oh, I also want to say, Roz, Roz, wait.

01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:02.440
Actually, it's Hockwell.

01:17:02.440 --> 01:17:02.940
Wait.

01:17:02.940 --> 01:17:03.800
Liquor was here.

01:17:03.800 --> 01:17:07.080
Roz, I just want to say real quick, one more thing.

01:17:07.080 --> 01:17:11.480
Do you drink liquor at all, ever?

01:17:11.480 --> 01:17:12.200
No.

01:17:12.200 --> 01:17:12.700
OK.

01:17:12.700 --> 01:17:14.320
Because I was going to say, if you ever

01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:17.880
want to try something really crazy, mix your Red Bull

01:17:17.880 --> 01:17:19.040
with vodka.

01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:19.840
Good stuff.

01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:21.240
Good stuff.

01:17:21.240 --> 01:17:21.760
All right.

01:17:21.760 --> 01:17:23.760
Oh, I've got a bottle of absolute downstairs.

01:17:23.760 --> 01:17:25.400
Because vodka numbs the taste buds

01:17:25.400 --> 01:17:28.780
make you not taste the pea flavor of Red Bull I don't I don't want to be

01:17:28.780 --> 01:17:32.120
responsible for starting someone's drinking career so you stay away from

01:17:32.120 --> 01:17:42.000
the absolute for tonight all right take care bye bye let's go to another call

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:48.600
hi you're on Orange Lounge radio hey hey who's this this is a Xander from Florida

01:17:48.600 --> 01:17:51.560
again hi Xander from Florida aren't you one of our listeners who shut out right

01:17:51.560 --> 01:17:52.560
now?

01:17:52.560 --> 01:17:53.560
Yes.

01:17:53.560 --> 01:17:56.460
Oh, I'm so sorry to hear it, but I don't know what to tell you.

01:17:56.460 --> 01:17:57.460
This is crazy.

01:17:57.460 --> 01:18:00.520
I've never seen this happen on Orange Lounge.

01:18:00.520 --> 01:18:04.200
Did somebody hear that we were giving away a million dollars or something?

01:18:04.200 --> 01:18:05.200
I don't know why.

01:18:05.200 --> 01:18:06.200
They knew that I was back.

01:18:06.200 --> 01:18:10.240
That's what I've been telling people to get them to listen.

01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:11.240
So I don't know.

01:18:11.240 --> 01:18:12.240
Maybe that's the problem.

01:18:12.240 --> 01:18:13.240
No.

01:18:13.240 --> 01:18:14.240
We're going to do something about it.

01:18:14.240 --> 01:18:16.540
We're just going to have to pony up the extra money to double our cap.

01:18:16.540 --> 01:18:22.840
But that will involve probably all of us having to get a second job, so no, I'm kidding.

01:18:22.840 --> 01:18:23.840
We're going to do something about it.

01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:27.320
We just can't do it tonight, so to speak, so you guys are kind of locked out tonight.

01:18:27.320 --> 01:18:31.160
So we're just surprised, because we have not been in danger of hitting our cap.

01:18:31.160 --> 01:18:35.560
But little known fact, or well, maybe not so little, but our podcast was actually featured

01:18:35.560 --> 01:18:37.160
on Yahoo this week.

01:18:37.160 --> 01:18:43.960
So I think because of that, if you go to podcast.yahoo.com, you see a little picture of our podcast.

01:18:43.960 --> 01:18:49.400
So I think that, in turn, created more podcast downloads, which, in turn, have created more

01:18:49.400 --> 01:18:51.720
show listeners.

01:18:51.720 --> 01:18:56.200
We're very happy that folks are tuning in to listen to the madness, but it's kind of

01:18:56.200 --> 01:18:57.680
crazy at the same time.

01:18:57.680 --> 01:19:01.400
Well, Xander, since you're not able to listen to the show, is there anything you want to

01:19:01.400 --> 01:19:03.400
tell our listeners?

01:19:03.400 --> 01:19:08.400
No, I can't think of anything right now.

01:19:08.400 --> 01:19:10.560
I know I had something before.

01:19:10.560 --> 01:19:12.640
I always lose it whenever I call you guys.

01:19:12.640 --> 01:19:16.360
It's the pressures of being on air that make you forget things, huh?

01:19:16.360 --> 01:19:20.440
So if you ever wonder why we don't ever talk about video games on the live show, it's the

01:19:20.440 --> 01:19:21.880
pressures of being on air.

01:19:21.880 --> 01:19:23.680
We completely forget about games.

01:19:23.680 --> 01:19:24.680
We do.

01:19:24.680 --> 01:19:26.720
All right, Xander, well, thanks for the call.

01:19:26.720 --> 01:19:27.720
Have a good one, okay?

01:19:27.720 --> 01:19:28.720
And I hope you get in.

01:19:28.720 --> 01:19:29.720
Okay.

01:19:29.720 --> 01:19:30.720
All right.

01:19:30.720 --> 01:19:31.720
Keep trying.

01:19:31.720 --> 01:19:32.720
Later.

01:19:32.720 --> 01:19:33.720
All right.

01:19:33.720 --> 01:19:34.720
Thank you, Xander, for calling.

01:19:34.720 --> 01:19:37.120
Okay, we're actually going to shut off the Skyplane just for a little bit and go to an

01:19:37.120 --> 01:19:38.120
actual break.

01:19:38.120 --> 01:19:42.600
We are going to come back, so if you haven't gotten through just yet, don't cry and scream

01:20:12.600 --> 01:20:20.600
Alright, we're going to do some DDR music in this break, and, um, oh yes, uh, Dark Soccer wanted to hear some You're Not Here, which was a song in DDR.

01:20:20.600 --> 01:20:24.600
Yeah, that's one of those songs with that belt-out outfit in my car when no one's in there with me.

01:20:24.600 --> 01:20:26.600
Oh, I want to hear your lovely singing voice sometime.

01:20:26.600 --> 01:20:31.600
Um, you won't because I don't have one.

01:20:31.600 --> 01:20:40.600
Fine. We'll be back after this, uh, with more Orange Lounge Radio, and your calls, and, oh, we'll, okay, we'll get the employer request soon.

01:20:40.600 --> 01:20:56.080
for watching, and I'll see you in the next video.

01:21:40.600 --> 01:21:42.600
You hadn't let me

01:21:42.600 --> 01:21:46.600
I'd be fine on my own, baby

01:21:46.600 --> 01:21:50.600
Never felt so lonely then you

01:21:50.600 --> 01:21:52.600
Came along

01:21:52.600 --> 01:21:55.600
So now what should I do?

01:21:55.600 --> 01:21:58.600
I'm strong out, I did it to you

01:21:58.600 --> 01:22:02.600
My body aches, now that you're gone

01:22:02.600 --> 01:22:07.600
My supply fell through

01:22:07.600 --> 01:22:12.000
And they gave me everything you had and more

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.500
He craves my happiness

01:22:14.500 --> 01:22:17.100
When you make me feel joy in me

01:22:17.100 --> 01:22:21.400
Just smile, but now I feel your stress

01:22:21.400 --> 01:22:26.000
Love was never meant to be such a crazy affair, no

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.400
And who has time but you?

01:22:28.400 --> 01:22:33.500
Never fall, I sit around and forever you love

01:22:33.500 --> 01:22:40.220
talking to you now

01:23:03.500 --> 01:23:24.380
Can you be your fantasy?

01:23:24.380 --> 01:23:27.380
Audit let's XC

01:24:24.380 --> 01:24:38.380
Look at what you see in your face The mirror of a dream

01:24:38.380 --> 01:24:48.380
Make believe I'm everywhere Living in your eyes

01:24:48.380 --> 01:24:50.380
Living in your eyes

01:24:51.380 --> 01:24:53.380
Return on the page

01:24:54.380 --> 01:24:56.380
It's the end of the world

01:24:56.380 --> 01:24:58.380
Never ending

01:24:58.380 --> 01:25:00.380
Slowly

01:25:04.380 --> 01:25:05.380
Never ending

01:25:05.380 --> 01:25:11.380
Glory, ah

01:25:19.380 --> 01:25:25.380
Life is a secret when I fall behind the clouds

01:25:25.380 --> 01:25:28.380
There is once a rainbow

01:25:28.380 --> 01:25:33.380
The answer to my never-ending song

01:25:33.380 --> 01:25:38.380
And I'll never be lost

01:25:38.380 --> 01:25:45.380
Never in my life

01:25:51.380 --> 01:25:53.380
Love, our truth

01:25:53.380 --> 01:25:56.380
This is what I prove

01:25:56.380 --> 01:25:59.380
Between me and you

01:25:59.380 --> 01:26:02.380
Oh, oh

01:26:02.380 --> 01:26:06.880
Love or truth, which I want you to choose

01:26:06.880 --> 01:26:09.380
Is for me and you

01:26:09.380 --> 01:26:11.380
Oh, oh, oh

01:26:12.380 --> 01:26:15.380
Baby, don't you think we're the kind of love

01:26:15.380 --> 01:26:16.380
I wanna get

01:26:16.380 --> 01:26:19.380
We wanna, wanna be, wanna be

01:26:19.380 --> 01:26:22.380
But I'm gonna die, you're my body

01:26:22.380 --> 01:26:24.880
Don't get me in your way

01:26:24.880 --> 01:26:27.380
Baby, don't you wish to be

01:26:27.380 --> 01:26:29.880
Gonna die the other day

01:26:59.880 --> 01:27:10.880
You know the way you and I gotta be

01:27:10.880 --> 01:27:23.880
You know the way you and I gotta be

01:27:23.880 --> 01:27:51.640
Alright, so typically this is the part of the show where we come back on air, however,

01:27:51.640 --> 01:27:55.760
Due to popular demand from our chat room, we are going to do one more song, and it's

01:27:55.760 --> 01:27:58.720
a brand new song from DER Ultramix 3.

01:27:58.720 --> 01:28:02.600
We're going to play this full song because it just rocks that much.

01:28:02.600 --> 01:28:03.600
Enjoy.

01:28:03.600 --> 01:28:10.600
It has a quiet opening, but trust me, this song is playing.

01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:39.720
It's Istanbul, it's Constantinople Now it's Istanbul, not Constantinople

01:28:39.720 --> 01:28:44.200
Been a long time gone, it's Constantinople Now it's Thursday night, on a moonlit night

01:28:44.200 --> 01:28:49.200
Every gal in Constantinople lives in Istanbul Now it's Constantinople, so do you that they

01:28:49.200 --> 01:28:52.200
live in Constantinople Shall we wait again in Istanbul?

01:28:52.200 --> 01:28:58.900
Even old New York was once New Amsterdam Why they changed it, I can't say

01:28:58.900 --> 01:29:02.900
People just liked it better that way So take me back to Constantinople

01:29:02.900 --> 01:29:06.140
No, you can't go back to Constantinople, been a long time gone

01:29:06.140 --> 01:29:09.140
Constantinople, why did Constantinople get the works?

01:29:09.140 --> 01:29:12.140
That's cool, but it's just about the terse

01:29:19.140 --> 01:29:20.140
Istanbul

01:29:20.140 --> 01:29:33.660
Istanbul, even old New York Was once New Amsterdam

01:29:33.660 --> 01:29:37.380
Why they changed it, I can't say You just liked it better that way

01:29:37.380 --> 01:29:41.780
It's Istanbul with Constantinople Now it's Istanbul with Constantinople

01:29:41.780 --> 01:29:45.780
They're a long time gone in Constantinople Why did Constantinople get the works?

01:29:45.780 --> 01:29:48.780
That's so much as it's by the Turks

01:29:48.780 --> 01:30:18.660
So take me back to Constantinople No you can't go back to Constantinople

01:30:18.660 --> 01:30:22.660
It's been a long time gone, Constantinople, why did Constantinople get the works?

01:30:22.660 --> 01:30:27.660
That's nobody's business but the Turks

01:30:27.660 --> 01:30:32.660
Istanbul

01:30:57.660 --> 01:30:58.660
to worry about.

01:30:58.660 --> 01:30:59.660
Loki?

01:30:59.660 --> 01:31:00.660
What's up?

01:31:00.660 --> 01:31:01.660
What's on your mind?

01:31:01.660 --> 01:31:02.660
Nothing.

01:31:02.660 --> 01:31:04.220
I have a figure I'll save it for after the cage match in my normal segment, which I covered

01:31:04.220 --> 01:31:05.940
the SimNews.

01:31:05.940 --> 01:31:08.900
Is there actually going to be SimNews tonight, or are you just going to go in there and-

01:31:08.900 --> 01:31:09.900
Of course!

01:31:09.900 --> 01:31:12.620
Did you know that DDR Mania X actually came back?

01:31:12.620 --> 01:31:13.620
Did they?

01:31:13.620 --> 01:31:14.620
I didn't know that.

01:31:14.620 --> 01:31:16.460
Apparently, they've been up for a while now, and-

01:31:16.460 --> 01:31:18.620
Can I- I have a confession to make.

01:31:18.620 --> 01:31:19.620
I don't- no, no, no.

01:31:19.620 --> 01:31:22.140
I don't want to offend anybody when I say this.

01:31:22.140 --> 01:31:25.660
I don't really visit any Bahmani sites besides DDR freakin' Orange Lounge.

01:31:25.660 --> 01:31:26.660
I really don't.

01:31:26.660 --> 01:31:31.660
Bemani style once in a great while, I kind of lurk just to kind of see what the goings ons are

01:31:31.660 --> 01:31:36.660
and I think I've done the same on air in Japan, but on a regular basis, I only visit DDR Freakin' Orange Lounge.

01:31:36.660 --> 01:31:38.660
I don't really surf the other sites.

01:31:38.660 --> 01:31:42.660
And it's not that they're bad sites, it's just I don't have time.

01:31:42.660 --> 01:31:43.660
Yes it is.

01:31:43.660 --> 01:31:50.660
We will have, hopefully, if everything works out, and I will go into this later,

01:31:50.660 --> 01:31:55.660
we will have more stuff in our download section for our PSP site.

01:31:55.660 --> 01:32:18.660
I just want to interrupt with one thing. A haiku.

01:32:18.660 --> 01:32:21.660
Go for it.

01:32:21.660 --> 01:32:27.520
I'm going to, I figured that I would start, you know, giving our listeners a little bit

01:32:27.520 --> 01:32:28.520
of culture.

01:32:28.520 --> 01:32:31.480
Since the Your Mama Joke of the Week kind of faded out, we're going to change that now

01:32:31.480 --> 01:32:32.480
to the Haiku of the Week?

01:32:32.480 --> 01:32:33.480
Yeah.

01:32:33.480 --> 01:32:34.480
Okay, so we're going to have the Haiku of the Week.

01:32:34.480 --> 01:32:36.480
Do you want some background music for your Haiku of the Week?

01:32:36.480 --> 01:32:37.480
No.

01:32:37.480 --> 01:32:38.480
Okay.

01:32:38.480 --> 01:32:39.480
After this one.

01:32:39.480 --> 01:32:40.480
Okay.

01:32:40.480 --> 01:32:44.520
Today's Haiku is a summarization of Gulliver's Towels by Jonathan Swift.

01:32:44.520 --> 01:32:54.040
Thus I was first great, then small, and much vexed to learn that size does matter.

01:32:54.040 --> 01:32:57.760
Interesting.

01:32:57.760 --> 01:33:01.460
You know, if you ever run out of advice columns, you should just have the haiku of the week

01:33:01.460 --> 01:33:02.800
on the podcast.

01:33:02.800 --> 01:33:03.800
Something.

01:33:03.800 --> 01:33:05.620
The Kama Sutra.

01:33:05.620 --> 01:33:07.960
Advice for those in a difficult position.

01:33:07.960 --> 01:33:14.960
to be flexible.

01:33:14.960 --> 01:33:18.920
Speaking of the Kama Sutra, let's talk about the Burning Crusade. Things you don't want

01:33:18.920 --> 01:33:24.040
after practicing the Kama Sutra. You don't want a Burning Crusade. Angel, you're one

01:33:24.040 --> 01:33:28.200
of our resident World of Warcraft whores. Who's got the highest level? What's your highest

01:33:28.200 --> 01:33:32.440
level? Me. DarkSakura? Seven. And Loki, you don't play that bullshit. My highest level

01:34:02.440 --> 01:34:08.240
all know. And I never really got into Warcraft 3 or Warcraft 2. I played a lot of Warcraft

01:34:08.240 --> 01:34:11.760
2, actually, but I was really fucking bad at it. Like, when I say really fucking bad,

01:34:11.760 --> 01:34:15.800
I mean really fucking bad at Warcraft. I did not have the brain capacity to handle so many

01:34:15.800 --> 01:34:19.280
things going on at once. Yeah, all of Warcraft is not a problem for me.

01:34:19.280 --> 01:34:24.560
Oh, man. I can't even explain it. I mean, I know there's a lot out there, you know,

01:34:24.560 --> 01:34:30.220
City of Heroes and now soon City of Villains and Final Fantasy XI and just, you know, there's

01:34:30.220 --> 01:34:40.220
There's a lot out there, EQ2, yeah, but it was a workout for me, wow, it's just, no pun

01:34:40.220 --> 01:34:41.220
intended.

01:34:41.220 --> 01:34:42.220
Yeah, all right, that's cool.

01:34:42.220 --> 01:34:43.220
So what's up?

01:34:43.220 --> 01:34:44.220
What's going to happen with this new expansion?

01:34:44.220 --> 01:34:46.900
Oh, so much.

01:34:46.900 --> 01:34:52.980
We're going to have what's called rideable mounts, which currently they have mounts for

01:34:52.980 --> 01:34:54.940
each race.

01:34:54.940 --> 01:35:00.580
When you hit 40, you can, you know, save up all your money and go train on riding and

01:35:00.580 --> 01:35:05.980
then go get your mount so that you can, like, be all cool and ride all fast around the lands

01:35:05.980 --> 01:35:08.940
rather than walking, because, well, we all know walking sucks.

01:35:08.940 --> 01:35:10.400
Yeah, walking sucks.

01:35:10.400 --> 01:35:12.180
And flying those birds takes forever sometimes, too.

01:35:12.180 --> 01:35:15.900
Yes, flying those birds can take forever and they can be expensive depending on where you

01:35:15.900 --> 01:35:18.780
need to go, so that's cool.

01:35:18.780 --> 01:35:23.140
They're going to have flyable mounts now in the new expansion.

01:35:23.140 --> 01:35:29.580
There's also going to be a lot of areas you need to explore and stuff like that.

01:35:29.580 --> 01:35:36.740
They're raising the level cap from 60 to 70, which will enable us to go beyond the dark

01:35:36.740 --> 01:35:38.420
portal.

01:35:38.420 --> 01:35:44.860
If you guys remember Warcraft 2 expansion, beyond the dark portal, quote unquote, and

01:35:44.860 --> 01:35:50.460
then, you know, Warcraft 3 and then so we're going to be able to go through the portal

01:35:50.460 --> 01:35:53.780
and i believe one of the um...

01:35:53.780 --> 01:35:55.460
things that you can do

01:35:55.460 --> 01:35:57.640
when you go beyond the dark portal

01:35:57.640 --> 01:36:02.020
is um... if you're a hoard you get to fight the final battle with thrall and try

01:36:02.020 --> 01:36:04.640
to save him and like all the stuff so

01:36:04.640 --> 01:36:08.540
that's going to be neat um... socketable items if you guys have played

01:36:08.540 --> 01:36:10.580
uh...

01:36:10.580 --> 01:36:13.100
diablo 2

01:36:13.100 --> 01:36:15.380
yeah that's going to be kind of neat

01:36:15.380 --> 01:36:16.740
uh... there's just going to be

01:36:16.740 --> 01:36:18.220
so much i

01:36:18.220 --> 01:36:22.020
I mean that's just, you know, the tip of the iceberg.

01:36:22.020 --> 01:36:23.660
Uh... new race

01:36:23.660 --> 01:36:26.620
for the Horde is going to be Blood Elves.

01:36:26.620 --> 01:36:30.400
Um... I do not know what the alliance is going to get, but...

01:36:30.400 --> 01:36:34.500
Ah, well, it's rumored it's going to be Pandaren, so...

01:36:34.500 --> 01:36:36.180
Pandaren.

01:36:36.180 --> 01:36:38.260
Pandaren.

01:36:38.260 --> 01:36:41.020
But, yeah, so...

01:36:41.020 --> 01:36:43.920
Uh... yeah.

01:36:43.920 --> 01:36:47.140
I don't know, am I forgetting something, Mr. Rob?

01:36:47.140 --> 01:36:53.100
I think you hit on most of the big points about what's going on with the expansion.

01:36:53.100 --> 01:36:57.300
The rumored Pandarian would be so cool if that really happens.

01:36:57.300 --> 01:36:59.580
I think you hit on most of the other big stuff.

01:36:59.580 --> 01:37:03.820
There's going to be a new profession like alchemy and stuff to go along with the socketed

01:37:03.820 --> 01:37:04.820
items.

01:37:04.820 --> 01:37:06.820
You could be a jewel master.

01:37:06.820 --> 01:37:10.860
Yeah, I can't really think of anything else.

01:37:10.860 --> 01:37:15.220
I probably did forget something or whatever along the way, but...

01:37:15.220 --> 01:37:18.220
Now, there's more information all over the internet, obviously, so take a look.

01:37:18.220 --> 01:37:24.220
Yeah, it's all over the internet now, but as it was coming out this weekend, I knew about a lot of it, so as it was coming out...

01:37:24.220 --> 01:37:26.220
Were you on the cell phone with somebody at the car or something?

01:37:26.220 --> 01:37:37.220
Actually, as you know, I'm kind of heavily watching another radio station that's heavily, heavily into World of Warcraft, and that's all they do on the station.

01:37:37.220 --> 01:37:38.220
You can plug them, I don't care.

01:37:38.220 --> 01:37:39.220
Oh, wcradio.com.

01:37:39.220 --> 01:37:40.220
Okay.

01:37:40.220 --> 01:37:41.220
Well, you know that.

01:37:41.220 --> 01:37:44.340
you know i'm all about supporting the independent radio i just don't like i'm

01:37:44.340 --> 01:37:45.840
not here and plug in you know

01:37:45.840 --> 01:37:50.580
no matter what one of the heads up and they'll find them not not no no my my

01:37:50.580 --> 01:37:54.240
number one will always be orange listeria obviously right now

01:37:54.240 --> 01:37:55.520
yes so

01:37:55.520 --> 01:37:58.140
and no i think i pretty much hit everything

01:37:58.140 --> 01:37:59.880
uh... new instances in

01:37:59.880 --> 01:38:01.260
all that stuff to show

01:38:01.260 --> 01:38:03.760
a is a lot to look forward to good times

01:38:03.760 --> 01:38:04.680
looking forward to it

01:38:04.680 --> 01:38:08.560
all right uh... we go back over the skype line in taking your call so if

01:38:08.560 --> 01:38:10.820
you do in a call in the show you can do that

01:38:10.820 --> 01:38:15.300
by uh... going over to our skype line at www.orangelaunchradio.com and clicking on

01:38:15.300 --> 01:38:19.060
interact with us for more information or you can always call us the old-fashioned way and

01:38:19.060 --> 01:38:20.740
that is uh... via the telephone

01:38:20.740 --> 01:38:23.500
916-226-9067

01:38:23.500 --> 01:38:26.640
let's go to our first call, hi you're on Orange Launch Radio

01:38:26.640 --> 01:38:28.540
Hi Separop1215

01:38:28.540 --> 01:38:31.860
Hey Separop1215 what's on your mind?

01:38:31.860 --> 01:38:34.940
uh... actually a lot of stuff today

01:38:34.940 --> 01:38:38.340
first of all to start off I'd like to say the uh...

01:38:38.340 --> 01:38:40.180
Ultramax 3

01:38:40.180 --> 01:38:43.980
list so far sounds pretty interesting and it's it's not that they give

01:38:43.980 --> 01:38:46.380
nami of hawaii a big budget now

01:38:46.380 --> 01:38:51.940
it is kind of weird like i had this all these songs from so many random

01:38:51.940 --> 01:38:53.640
different places but

01:38:53.640 --> 01:38:57.020
i don't know i strangely dig it there's really is something for everyone i mean

01:38:57.020 --> 01:38:59.900
i know they've said that about previous tdr mixes

01:38:59.900 --> 01:39:03.580
that later something for everyone that no seriously guys this time something

01:39:03.580 --> 01:39:07.000
for everyone like even like ray charles

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:08.820
no affects come on that

01:39:08.820 --> 01:39:13.660
That's tapping into audiences that never would have looked twice at DDR before, so that's

01:39:13.660 --> 01:39:14.660
something else.

01:39:14.660 --> 01:39:15.660
Yeah.

01:39:15.660 --> 01:39:21.540
But otherwise, something you haven't really talked about is the recent release of DDR

01:39:21.540 --> 01:39:23.980
Mario Mix here.

01:39:23.980 --> 01:39:28.900
I kind of glossed over DDR Mario Mix because I haven't picked up my copy yet, because I

01:39:28.900 --> 01:39:34.980
bought Soul Calibur 3 instead this week, which should show you where I'm at DDR-wise.

01:39:34.980 --> 01:39:40.060
Plus, you know, I just... it doesn't seem like something that's that difficult, but

01:39:40.060 --> 01:39:41.060
I don't know, what do you think?

01:39:41.060 --> 01:39:43.060
Did you pick it up?

01:39:43.060 --> 01:39:47.100
Uh, technically, I did, but I got it for free, so...

01:39:47.100 --> 01:39:48.100
Okay, okay.

01:39:48.100 --> 01:39:50.380
Oh, did you, like, win one of those tournaments or something?

01:39:50.380 --> 01:39:54.660
Uh, yeah, only three people showed up, and two of which were my friends.

01:39:54.660 --> 01:39:56.540
Good job, good job anyway.

01:39:56.540 --> 01:40:02.420
Yeah, so I just got it for free, and I unlocked pretty much everything just last night, and

01:40:02.420 --> 01:40:03.420
it was totally heavy.

01:40:03.420 --> 01:40:10.260
cool or was it all Mario stuff and and classical tunes being redone? Yeah it's

01:40:10.260 --> 01:40:15.760
it's okay the song is okay. What I think is interesting is the way they did it of

01:40:15.760 --> 01:40:18.920
how it's just like a Mario game where you go through different worlds and go

01:40:18.920 --> 01:40:27.960
through the levels in the worlds. Really? Yeah but otherwise it's I think

01:40:27.960 --> 01:40:31.860
it's really good that I got it for free because I wouldn't really pay for it

01:40:31.860 --> 01:40:34.740
unless it was maybe cheaper.

01:40:34.740 --> 01:40:39.520
Yeah, it's a little too much money for me right now, too. Don't they want, like, 60 bucks for it with the pad and everything?

01:40:39.520 --> 01:40:45.720
Yeah, but I actually think that soft pad is really nice. It has more padding in the middle.

01:40:45.720 --> 01:40:53.440
The pads have been getting progressively nicer through various CDR mixes, because we had the one for, you know, the original one, which is okay.

01:40:53.440 --> 01:41:00.040
And there was actually the old old Konami mat for the Dreamcast that had that funny layer of plastic over the mat.

01:41:00.040 --> 01:41:03.040
That's right, you had these mats. They were like some of the first mats I ever played on.

01:41:03.040 --> 01:41:08.400
I had the Dreamcast ones that were the triple thicky thing, and now they slide apart.

01:41:08.400 --> 01:41:12.040
Yeah. But then... They're not as good as one thinks they are.

01:41:12.040 --> 01:41:17.240
And then the Xbox ones were really good, and now the GameCube ones. So they've had a lot of time to get it right.

01:41:17.240 --> 01:41:23.120
So. Yeah. So far, I think those are the best soft pads, but I have a metal pad anyway, so...

01:41:23.120 --> 01:41:27.720
whatever. I don't care. Do you think there's enough here for DDR fans to be happy?

01:41:27.720 --> 01:41:40.720
If you're a fan of Mario, yeah. But I mean, you can't even play the hardest level unless you beat the song on Very Hard, very much like Disney Mix.

01:41:40.720 --> 01:41:41.720
Okay.

01:41:41.720 --> 01:41:45.720
Which, all right, it's annoying, but Very Hard is just like an easy standard.

01:41:45.720 --> 01:41:49.720
I was going to say, isn't Very Hard like Five and Sixes anyway?

01:41:49.720 --> 01:41:50.720
Yeah.

01:41:50.720 --> 01:41:51.720
Yeah.

01:41:51.720 --> 01:41:52.720
So Mario...

01:41:52.720 --> 01:41:53.720
randomized.

01:41:53.720 --> 01:41:54.720
Go ahead.

01:41:54.720 --> 01:41:55.720
It's all right, it's all right.

01:41:55.720 --> 01:42:02.260
Mario Mix is kind of one of those games that's going to be more for kids, people that just

01:42:02.260 --> 01:42:09.340
are obsessed with Nintendo, like ultimate Nintendo fanboys and stuff, or you know, people

01:42:09.340 --> 01:42:12.500
that like the GameCube or only have a GameCube or like the GameCube things.

01:42:12.500 --> 01:42:16.620
I think most of the hardcore DDR people are going to find their game somewhere else.

01:42:16.620 --> 01:42:20.220
It's definitely a good mix to start out with for somebody who hasn't played yet though.

01:42:20.220 --> 01:42:21.220
Oh, that's cool.

01:42:21.220 --> 01:42:22.220
It's definitely good.

01:42:22.220 --> 01:42:23.220
They need that too.

01:42:23.220 --> 01:42:29.220
Alright, well Sephiroth1215, I'll let you have your final words, then we're going to let you go, try to get another call.

01:42:29.220 --> 01:42:43.220
Alright, last thing I wanted to say, which I can't confirm or anything, I just heard around, is that the Xbox 360 is, you can't get the premiums in first come, first serve stores.

01:42:43.220 --> 01:42:47.300
stores. I hope that's a lot of bullshit, because if it is not bullshit and that leads out to

01:42:47.300 --> 01:42:50.980
be true, I'm going to be one pissed motherfucker. I'm going to be one pissed motherfucker. I

01:42:50.980 --> 01:42:59.980
should not have to reserve that crap. I can't be sure of that, though. Where did you hear

01:42:59.980 --> 01:43:05.340
it, though? Did you hear it at a store that does reservations? Yeah, first I heard it

01:43:05.340 --> 01:43:08.900
online in Game Facts, which I'm like, whatever, I don't really believe you. Then I went to

01:43:08.900 --> 01:43:12.840
a store, and they said, yeah, we're not allowed to take any cores, because they're sending

01:43:12.840 --> 01:43:16.640
all the cores out to the stores and we're getting all the premiums, trying to get all

01:43:16.640 --> 01:43:18.520
the pre-orders up.

01:43:18.520 --> 01:43:22.180
I have this weird feeling, I hope it's not true or I'm going to be pissed. I cannot imagine

01:43:22.180 --> 01:43:25.600
a huge chain like Best Buy that they would screw over somebody like Best Buy or Toys

01:43:25.600 --> 01:43:31.920
R Us with that. I don't know, maybe we'll call Microsoft on the podcast or something

01:43:31.920 --> 01:43:35.280
if it wasn't so late on a Sunday night they were open. I swear we'd call somebody and

01:43:35.280 --> 01:43:40.360
try to figure it out. I have a feeling it's false, but we'll see. If it does turn out

01:43:40.360 --> 01:43:45.640
to be true, I'm gonna be pissed. Yeah, you can still reserve it, but I don't think you're

01:43:45.640 --> 01:43:51.880
guaranteed it until next year sometimes. What a crap. What a bunch of crap. I will get one

01:43:51.880 --> 01:43:57.640
launch day, just you wait. We'll see. Or I might come back on this show and say, fuck

01:43:57.640 --> 01:44:02.960
Microsoft, I hate them. Alright. I'm gonna let you go now, bud, okay? Okay. Alright,

01:44:02.960 --> 01:44:07.840
take care, have a good one. Alright. Later. Okay, we're gonna do one more call, and then

01:44:07.840 --> 01:44:11.840
We're going to have to go over to the cage match, and then we might do some more calls

01:44:11.840 --> 01:44:12.840
later.

01:44:12.840 --> 01:44:13.840
But first, one more.

01:44:13.840 --> 01:44:14.840
Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio.

01:44:14.840 --> 01:44:15.840
Obviously, you already know who this is.

01:44:15.840 --> 01:44:16.840
Hey, Zaku, what's on your mind?

01:44:16.840 --> 01:44:26.800
I'm posting up a link right now that pretty much might be of your interest.

01:44:26.800 --> 01:44:31.000
Some of you might hate it, some of you might say, what the fuck am I doing?

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:32.000
But here we go.

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:38.000
It's from CDR's Week in New York forums, but I think you'll see what I'm trying to tell you.

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:41.000
Okay, so give us a description of it while it loads on the computers here.

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:46.000
Alright, basically, MTV wants New York City TDR players.

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:54.000
Don't know why, but this dude who was probably recruited by them is seeking our kind.

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:59.000
Hmm, okay, so if you live in the New York area, let's see.

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:02.360
New York City, sorry, New York City.

01:45:02.360 --> 01:45:06.960
Somebody was recently contacted by MTV direct effects casting director to

01:45:06.960 --> 01:45:10.320
film an episode based on video gaming culture.

01:45:10.320 --> 01:45:14.000
They have to round up fifty to sixty gamers from New York City that are unique, outgoing,

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.360
who basically break the stereotype

01:45:16.360 --> 01:45:19.720
of the anti-social gamer geek. Hey, too bad they're on the

01:45:19.720 --> 01:45:21.560
east coast. We'd have

01:45:21.560 --> 01:45:24.240
something fun for them here in California.

01:45:24.240 --> 01:45:28.440
As you can see in the thread, I've already signed up as well as several other prominent players.

01:45:28.440 --> 01:45:36.440
They already called me back that same day, and MTV is supposed to be calling me soon

01:45:36.440 --> 01:45:37.440
about the interview date.

01:45:37.440 --> 01:45:38.440
Awesome.

01:45:38.440 --> 01:45:41.440
We'll drop our name a whole bunch, all right?

01:45:41.440 --> 01:45:42.440
We'll see.

01:45:42.440 --> 01:45:43.440
I'm just messing with you.

01:45:43.440 --> 01:45:44.440
Have fun with it.

01:45:44.440 --> 01:45:45.440
Have fun with it.

01:45:45.440 --> 01:45:46.440
That's great news.

01:45:46.440 --> 01:45:48.440
Yeah, that's basically what they want.

01:45:48.440 --> 01:45:57.440
They want sociable and outgoing people to just break that stereotype, which is basically

01:45:57.440 --> 01:46:04.220
what we are in a nutshell.

01:46:04.220 --> 01:46:10.980
As far as UltraMix III songs go, freestylers are fine, that's all you need to know.

01:46:10.980 --> 01:46:19.180
If we were able a couple of weeks ago to hook up a PS2 to a DDR machine and use it as such,

01:46:19.180 --> 01:46:23.220
we could probably do the same thing for an Xbox and pour out the songs for freestyle

01:46:23.220 --> 01:46:24.220
routines.

01:46:24.220 --> 01:46:29.460
Oh yeah, it's going to be great for freestyle people, so it's got such a solid song list.

01:46:29.460 --> 01:46:33.500
If we could get it, that's if we could, you know, hook up an Xbox to a DER machine in

01:46:33.500 --> 01:46:34.500
about a year.

01:46:34.500 --> 01:46:35.820
You never know.

01:46:35.820 --> 01:46:36.820
You never know.

01:46:36.820 --> 01:46:37.820
Mm-hmm.

01:46:37.820 --> 01:46:38.820
Okay, okay.

01:46:38.820 --> 01:46:43.020
Well, good luck with the MTV thing, and you know, I don't really watch MTV, but I'll make

01:46:43.020 --> 01:46:44.020
an exception.

01:46:44.020 --> 01:46:46.820
If you get on it, I'll TiVo it or something.

01:46:46.820 --> 01:46:50.060
I just, yeah, I just hope, I just hope I get in.

01:46:50.060 --> 01:46:51.060
All right.

01:46:51.060 --> 01:46:59.060
Yeah, it was probably in a few weeks anyway, so as I said, watch out, I might be on TV.

01:46:59.060 --> 01:47:04.060
If I am, just, you know, you'll probably mention it on Sunday.

01:47:04.060 --> 01:47:08.060
Maybe. We might. No, I'm kidding. We would. We would.

01:47:08.060 --> 01:47:13.060
Well, good luck with that, and, you know, again, name drop a lot. Orange Lounge. Love it. No, I'm just kidding.

01:47:13.060 --> 01:47:14.060
Have a good one, all right?

01:47:14.060 --> 01:47:15.060
Got an open one?

01:47:15.060 --> 01:47:18.060
I gotta let you go so we can get more calls.

01:47:18.060 --> 01:47:19.060
All right, bye.

01:47:19.060 --> 01:47:20.060
Later.

01:47:20.060 --> 01:47:22.780
He's going to be on the TV.

01:47:22.780 --> 01:47:24.460
You know, some of us are going to be on the TV.

01:47:24.460 --> 01:47:28.660
I'm not going to be on the TV, but some of us are going to be on the TV here locally.

01:47:28.660 --> 01:47:35.300
Next week, on the 8th, doing a Guitar Hero review on one of the stations here in Sacramento.

01:47:35.300 --> 01:47:36.860
All right.

01:47:36.860 --> 01:47:39.700
Actually looking at the time, I think what we're going to do is actually go into this

01:47:39.700 --> 01:47:40.700
nice cage match.

01:47:40.700 --> 01:47:43.500
We need to get into that or we're going to run out of time.

01:47:43.500 --> 01:47:45.200
So let's go ahead and get it started.

01:47:45.200 --> 01:47:47.200
the Orange Lounge Radio cage match.

01:47:47.200 --> 01:47:51.680
The way the cage match works, you have to be in our chat room.

01:47:51.680 --> 01:47:56.760
If you want to participate, www.orangeloungeradio.com, click on Chat.

01:47:56.760 --> 01:47:59.440
And the way the cage match works, we're going to play three songs for you guys.

01:47:59.440 --> 01:48:03.460
Each host picks a song, and you guys are going to vote for your favorite.

01:48:03.460 --> 01:48:07.560
And the winning song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's Flamani

01:48:07.560 --> 01:48:12.520
and Video Game Music program, which plays 24 hours a day, 7 days a week on this station.

01:48:12.520 --> 01:48:18.220
number one tonight is going for its fourth week win. If it wins tonight, it

01:48:18.220 --> 01:48:23.440
will be retired. It will be only the, I think, fifth song to be retired out of

01:48:23.440 --> 01:48:27.240
Orange Lawn Radio's cage match in this couple years we've been doing this. So

01:48:27.240 --> 01:48:31.460
here it is. It's song number four. It wasn't even really picked by one of us. I

01:48:31.460 --> 01:48:36.100
mean, I put it in, but I put it in on behalf of Miklotov, so just kind of

01:48:36.100 --> 01:48:38.940
interesting the way that works out. So this would be the first song that we get

01:48:38.940 --> 01:48:43.380
retired that was not even put in by one of us so be very interesting to see what

01:48:43.380 --> 01:48:48.960
happens so here it is it's song number one going for its fourth win in a row

01:48:48.960 --> 01:48:55.960
So will it be retired? It's up to you. Pendulum withholds your color.

01:49:18.960 --> 01:49:42.080
So can't figure out how to cut the castle open

01:49:42.080 --> 01:49:47.580
They take everything away

01:49:47.580 --> 01:49:55.080
And those who cares, they can't do all of that

01:49:55.080 --> 01:49:57.080
They take everything away

01:49:57.080 --> 01:50:25.560
You look into your eyes, and so I lay her knee

01:50:25.560 --> 01:50:31.320
Don't try to save yourself, Mr. Hall is gonna reach

01:50:31.320 --> 01:50:35.720
We're not reaching out and to see you

01:50:35.720 --> 01:50:40.440
Nothing else can touch me

01:50:40.440 --> 01:50:43.240
So can't find the hope

01:50:43.240 --> 01:50:47.800
Who comes against the road

01:50:47.800 --> 01:50:53.640
When they take everything away

01:50:53.640 --> 01:51:21.640
All right, let's get to it.

01:51:21.640 --> 01:51:25.800
Alright, let's get into song number two tonight.

01:51:25.800 --> 01:51:28.400
Song number two is Dark Sakura's Pick.

01:51:28.400 --> 01:51:30.880
Dark Sakura, what did you pick for us?

01:51:30.880 --> 01:51:32.880
Um, it's...

01:51:32.880 --> 01:51:35.640
Here, use mine.

01:51:35.640 --> 01:51:37.920
It's OG Bitch.

01:51:37.920 --> 01:51:40.240
OG Bitch by Estero.

01:51:40.240 --> 01:51:41.240
Huh?

01:51:41.240 --> 01:51:42.240
Remixed.

01:51:42.240 --> 01:51:46.520
Any particular reason you picked a song called OG Bitch?

01:51:46.520 --> 01:51:47.520
I just like Estero.

01:51:47.520 --> 01:51:50.640
Alright, here it is, song number two, Estero.

01:51:50.640 --> 01:51:57.520
It dethroned pendulum. We'll see a sterile with og bitch the orange factory mix. So how appropriate we back up this

01:53:50.640 --> 01:53:57.640
You're just waiting for me to drown, So no one knows that you stole my whole sound,

01:53:57.640 --> 01:54:04.640
And yet you're grinning when I come around, So no one knows that you stole my whole sound,

01:54:04.640 --> 01:54:08.640
And yet you're grinning when I come around,

01:54:08.640 --> 01:54:29.920
I know, I know you love me, yeah, yeah I know, I know you love me, yeah, yeah

01:54:59.920 --> 01:55:18.320
Alright, uttering her first words on the new microphone, Dark Sakura will let us know how

01:55:18.320 --> 01:55:19.840
she liked OG Bitch.

01:55:19.840 --> 01:55:20.840
Nine.

01:55:20.840 --> 01:55:22.840
It's a nine from Dark Sakura.

01:55:22.840 --> 01:55:25.040
Yeah, I think it went through.

01:55:25.040 --> 01:55:27.680
Dark Sakura, give us a sentence.

01:55:27.680 --> 01:55:28.680
I like Doritos.

01:55:28.680 --> 01:55:40.280
p0k3smot42o

01:55:40.280 --> 01:55:50.280
p0k3smot42o

01:55:50.280 --> 01:55:54.280
because I had a cool beat to it. Like, I liked the remix. I'm not so sure I was up on the

01:55:54.280 --> 01:55:59.280
singing, because the singing kind of had this kind of weird thing to it, but it was cool.

01:55:59.280 --> 01:56:05.280
I mean, it's the song I could see myself getting down at the club, OG clubbing, so I give it

01:56:05.280 --> 01:56:07.280
an 8. That's pretty good.

01:56:07.280 --> 01:56:09.280
Extifer, what did you think?

01:56:09.280 --> 01:56:16.280
Um, she didn't sound like a gangsta, but I will give it a 5, because I don't know what

01:56:16.280 --> 01:56:19.280
to think. I'm purely in the middle on that one.

01:56:19.280 --> 01:56:25.280
Angel. I liked the beat to it, it was pretty neat. Um, six.

01:56:25.280 --> 01:56:31.280
Alright. Song number three tonight, going up against Estro and Pendulum is...

01:56:31.280 --> 01:56:33.280
Loki, what you put in?

01:56:33.280 --> 01:56:38.280
You know, this is just one of those weeks where I had nothing really to put in.

01:56:38.280 --> 01:56:46.280
So this song will go out to Captain Jack being dead and all, but um, this is actually, I think out of all the songs I've listened to him,

01:56:46.280 --> 01:56:52.680
best thumbs up, you know, kind of the mood with him being, you know, dead and everything.

01:56:52.680 --> 01:56:58.280
But, um, it's also really strange. It's a really strange song. I'm saying all votes go to Pendulum

01:56:58.280 --> 01:57:02.180
because that's a fucking awesome song, but here you go. It's something to fill up.

01:57:02.180 --> 01:57:04.180
I don't know, you're going for the sympathy vote tonight.

01:57:04.180 --> 01:57:09.180
I'm not even hoping to get any votes, but, you know, because the song I want to put in was too long

01:57:09.180 --> 01:57:12.180
and I didn't want to cut it down, so, anyway.

01:57:12.180 --> 01:57:19.180
Let's see. Song number three, going out to the man, Captain Jack. It's Captain Jack with Back Home. Enjoy.

01:57:42.180 --> 01:57:57.540
The captain wants to be back home And the captain fights against the storm

01:57:57.540 --> 01:58:03.380
He's always true to gifts He always wants to live and be back home

01:58:03.380 --> 01:58:10.980
It was a lonely night with a pack full of dreams

01:58:10.980 --> 01:58:13.620
Miles away from home, I felt cold and at ease

01:58:13.620 --> 01:58:17.980
As if I was the only human being on Earth I thought about the soldiers and the peace

01:58:17.980 --> 01:58:21.380
can't spare Couldn't stop thinking about my company

01:58:21.380 --> 01:58:27.220
About coming home, life and history How everything started with Captain Jack

01:58:27.220 --> 01:58:28.220
When will I meet you?

01:58:28.220 --> 01:58:29.220
When will I be back?

01:58:29.220 --> 01:58:35.220
Try, try hard, get the best you can So never stop fighting for the peace in your land

01:58:35.220 --> 01:58:40.220
Come together and see the light All for one, like a stick of dynamite

01:58:40.220 --> 01:58:50.220
The captain wants to be back home And the captain fights against the storm

01:58:50.220 --> 01:58:59.220
He always wants to live and be back home

01:58:59.220 --> 01:59:04.220
After hours and hours of marching through the land

01:59:04.220 --> 01:59:07.220
There was something in the air, velvet flower in my hand

01:59:07.220 --> 01:59:10.220
The grass was green and the moon shined bright

01:59:10.220 --> 01:59:12.220
Remembered that night when she held me tight

01:59:12.220 --> 01:59:15.220
I went down to the river to the water bottle

01:59:15.220 --> 01:59:18.220
Took hours long for my belly for the crazy couple

01:59:18.220 --> 01:59:20.720
One morning came and I reached the can

01:59:20.720 --> 01:59:23.720
I took a break and laid down in the warm white sand

01:59:23.720 --> 01:59:26.220
So try, try hard and get the best you can

01:59:26.220 --> 01:59:28.720
Never stop fighting for the peace in our land

01:59:28.720 --> 01:59:31.720
Come together and see the light

01:59:31.720 --> 01:59:34.220
All for one like a stick of dynamite

01:59:34.220 --> 01:59:39.220
The captain wants to be back home

01:59:39.220 --> 01:59:43.720
And the captain fights against the storm

01:59:43.720 --> 01:59:45.220
Fight against

01:59:45.220 --> 01:59:47.720
His own ways to the game

01:59:47.720 --> 01:59:51.720
He always wants to live and be back home

01:59:55.720 --> 01:59:59.720
The captain wants to be back home

02:00:00.720 --> 02:00:04.720
And the captain is feeling all alone

02:00:06.720 --> 02:00:08.720
He's always true to me

02:00:08.720 --> 02:00:13.720
He always wants to live and be back home

02:00:17.720 --> 02:00:19.720
Tack, tack, tack, never looking back

02:00:19.720 --> 02:00:22.720
Come and fight for Captain Jack

02:00:22.720 --> 02:00:25.720
Say it slow, but say it loud

02:00:25.720 --> 02:00:27.720
Join the peace camp and you'll be proud

02:00:27.720 --> 02:00:30.720
Jump and walk, train and talk

02:00:30.720 --> 02:00:33.720
Move your body, you're not a piece of talk

02:00:33.720 --> 02:00:35.720
Scream and shout, call out my name

02:00:35.720 --> 02:00:38.720
It's Captain Jess, straight back again

02:00:38.720 --> 02:00:43.720
The Captain wants to be back home

02:00:43.720 --> 02:00:48.720
And the Captain fights against us all

02:00:48.720 --> 02:00:49.720
He fights against us all

02:00:49.720 --> 02:00:52.720
He's always true to give

02:00:52.720 --> 02:00:56.720
He always wants to live and be back home

02:00:59.720 --> 02:01:00.720
Ooh-ooh

02:01:00.720 --> 02:01:04.720
The Captain wants to be back home

02:01:04.720 --> 02:01:18.720
And the captain is feeling all alone He's always true to give He always wants to live and be back home

02:01:18.720 --> 02:01:32.720
The captain wants to be back home And the captain fights against the storm

02:01:32.720 --> 02:01:43.720
He's always trying to get He always wants to live and be back home

02:01:43.720 --> 02:01:48.720
The captain wants to be back home

02:01:48.720 --> 02:01:53.720
And the captain is feeling all alone

02:01:53.720 --> 02:01:56.720
He's always trying to get

02:01:56.720 --> 02:02:01.720
Your place wants to never be that old

02:02:26.720 --> 02:02:44.860
Song number three in tonight's case match, Captain Jack with Back Home, the captain's

02:02:44.860 --> 02:02:45.860
remix.

02:02:45.860 --> 02:02:49.880
Dark Sakura, what did you think of that tribute that Loki picked there for Captain Jack?

02:02:49.880 --> 02:02:52.680
I'm presently bleeding out of my ear from brain hemorrhage.

02:02:52.680 --> 02:02:55.800
Careful, I think that's what Captain Jack died of.

02:02:55.800 --> 02:02:58.840
I know, this one gets two.

02:02:58.840 --> 02:03:02.880
A two from Dark Sakura? Loki!

02:03:02.880 --> 02:03:06.380
You know, I don't know, it just

02:03:06.380 --> 02:03:11.320
is a weird song. I think the song, like, was okay until he started

02:03:11.320 --> 02:03:14.520
doing his, like, rapping or whatever that is.

02:03:14.520 --> 02:03:18.180
Um, it gets, like, a seven

02:03:18.180 --> 02:03:24.200
for the mindbase who's been dead. Actually, I have to, I have to say, his rapping reminded me of, like,

02:03:24.200 --> 02:03:26.520
new edition in ronie

02:03:26.520 --> 02:03:28.880
with like bobby brown trying to rap

02:03:28.880 --> 02:03:30.160
kinda

02:03:30.160 --> 02:03:33.560
i don't know, like i said, throw away songs to where

02:03:33.560 --> 02:03:40.560
uh... you know what song that was? you know that song kinda reminded me of something else?

02:03:44.740 --> 02:03:49.920
i like that song. and that song sucked too. i like it. sorry, you know what?

02:03:49.920 --> 02:03:51.240
captain jack was the man

02:03:51.240 --> 02:03:53.400
but he needs to stick to barking orders

02:03:53.400 --> 02:03:56.260
because that's what i want to pay attention i don't like

02:03:56.260 --> 02:03:58.580
i don't like and picked anything i don't like that

02:03:58.580 --> 02:04:02.760
but i don't like that with the captain jack in that time i like that sorry

02:04:02.760 --> 02:04:06.540
but i think that he brought a record and yes sir yes sir yes sir

02:04:06.540 --> 02:04:09.980
i will party down right now

02:04:09.980 --> 02:04:15.080
there is a song that's actually on the theme cd that it's called uh...

02:04:15.080 --> 02:04:17.520
highland was called after yesterday

02:04:17.520 --> 02:04:20.580
it's not like that and it's about like captain jack

02:04:20.580 --> 02:04:23.580
I'm gonna beat down the soldiers if they don't listen to him.

02:04:23.580 --> 02:04:30.580
There you go. That's the Captain Jack I like. I don't like this Captain Jack wah wah wah. I'm going home wah wah.

02:04:30.580 --> 02:04:35.580
All right, anyway, Extrovert, what did you think? Oh, I give it a 2 plus 1 is 3.

02:04:35.580 --> 02:04:37.580
Extrovert, what did you think?

02:04:37.580 --> 02:04:45.580
That's the kind of song that I'd like to listen at the stroke of 1130 when I'm about to go to sleep at night.

02:04:45.580 --> 02:04:53.700
Suddenly I'll wake up, you know, in the hospital surrounded by my hot bitches as I'm flipping

02:04:53.700 --> 02:04:54.700
into my coma.

02:04:54.700 --> 02:05:00.100
Wait, hold on, I need to check with the judges.

02:05:00.100 --> 02:05:04.540
Judges, are we allowed to be insensitive after only a week?

02:05:04.540 --> 02:05:05.540
I don't know.

02:05:05.540 --> 02:05:06.540
Is that politically correct?

02:05:06.540 --> 02:05:07.540
Yes.

02:05:07.540 --> 02:05:12.060
I was never really sensitive to begin with, so I'm kind of...

02:05:12.060 --> 02:05:14.060
Please try not to piss off the listeners.

02:05:14.060 --> 02:05:15.060
Hi, listeners.

02:05:15.060 --> 02:05:25.060
I will give it an 8, because I think that this song should win over the pendulum song that has been, like, winning.

02:05:25.060 --> 02:05:27.060
Don't forget about the OG bitch!

02:05:27.060 --> 02:05:30.060
Um, no, I don't know. She didn't sound like a gangsta.

02:05:30.060 --> 02:05:34.060
That's a whole... I'm not... I'm all for...

02:05:34.060 --> 02:05:36.060
But Captain Jack is an OG bitch.

02:05:36.060 --> 02:05:39.060
I'm all for the true Compton gangstas, okay?

02:05:39.060 --> 02:05:44.060
I like Compton gangstas, not Mexican Latina gangstas.

02:05:44.060 --> 02:05:47.060
Alright, Angel, what did you think?

02:05:48.060 --> 02:06:00.060
It kind of reminded me of like the 80's, like, not so much love song stuff, but like, I don't know, like R&B love song type, I don't know.

02:06:00.060 --> 02:06:01.060
The crappy songs, Angel.

02:06:01.060 --> 02:06:03.060
Yeah, that'll work.

02:06:08.060 --> 02:06:12.060
Oh, I'll be nice, I guess. Give it a 6.

02:06:12.060 --> 02:06:18.260
All right, let's recap. It's not up to us, it's up to you. You folks in chatroom, get

02:06:18.260 --> 02:06:22.380
your say. The three songs you can vote for tonight. Song number one, Pendulum, hold your

02:06:22.380 --> 02:06:33.240
color. And song number two you can vote for tonight is Estero with OG Bitch, the Orange

02:06:33.240 --> 02:06:40.240
factory mix.

02:06:41.640 --> 02:06:45.680
And song number three you can vote for tonight is Captain Jack with

02:06:45.680 --> 02:06:52.680
Back Home.

02:06:52.680 --> 02:06:59.680
After hours and hours of listening to that song, my brain is hemorrhaging all night.

02:07:22.680 --> 02:07:29.320
those who didn't know it, um, WOOOOO! Sorry, I'm just really excited. Okay. Well, what's

02:07:29.320 --> 02:07:33.120
cool about that is there's more sim stuff it seems like on DDR Maniacs than there was

02:07:33.120 --> 02:07:37.580
on Bomani's style. A lot more stuff that's going into like theme development and stuff

02:07:37.580 --> 02:07:44.580
like that. Plus you can get downloadable characters for Cloud and Tifa. Whoopsie-doo. Um, anyways,

02:07:44.580 --> 02:07:51.080
um, the big thing that I was looking for, and trying to find a link, um, to, but unfortunately

02:07:51.080 --> 02:08:01.080
the pages down right now is, for the PSP, it's Beatmania BMS Player and DDR BMS Player.

02:08:01.080 --> 02:08:06.500
And these are both for the PSP. They have a video or sort of a little animation on their

02:08:06.500 --> 02:08:13.840
site right now showing the DDR one in action with full background videos and it looks pretty

02:08:13.840 --> 02:08:20.540
cool so far. Unfortunately, all the links are down for it right now. And the Beatmania

02:08:20.540 --> 02:08:25.180
one is available right now. I tried downloading it to my PSP, but I can't get it to play anything,

02:08:25.180 --> 02:08:30.700
so both of these are still a work in progress right now. Anyways, if you're interested in

02:08:30.700 --> 02:08:40.060
the link, I will post it in the chat room. Sweet. Is that it? That's pretty much it for

02:08:40.060 --> 02:08:47.380
now. Other than that, Bill Mice still is back up too. Are they still begging for money?

02:08:47.380 --> 02:08:48.380
me?

02:08:48.380 --> 02:08:49.380
I'm sure.

02:08:49.380 --> 02:08:50.380
Okay.

02:08:50.380 --> 02:08:51.380
No.

02:08:51.380 --> 02:08:52.380
No.

02:08:52.380 --> 02:08:55.380
They're putting up more media stuff right now, like Simphile stuff.

02:08:55.380 --> 02:08:56.380
Good times.

02:08:56.380 --> 02:08:57.380
Time.

02:08:57.380 --> 02:08:58.380
Yeah.

02:08:58.380 --> 02:08:59.380
Oh.

02:08:59.380 --> 02:09:00.380
Oh.

02:09:00.380 --> 02:09:02.380
I forgot to check and see if they had more Simphiles up there for MaxRemix.

02:09:02.380 --> 02:09:03.380
Oh.

02:09:03.380 --> 02:09:04.380
Goody.

02:09:04.380 --> 02:09:05.380
Just what the world needs, more MaxRemixes.

02:09:05.380 --> 02:09:09.660
I don't think that their Simphiles are up quite yet, but I'm sure that pretty soon they

02:09:09.660 --> 02:09:10.660
will be.

02:09:10.660 --> 02:09:16.380
I know that actually you can go on ddrmaniax.net.

02:09:16.380 --> 02:09:22.920
They have a build in progress right now for StepMania 4, which is almost done.

02:09:22.920 --> 02:09:25.320
So that should be pretty cool.

02:09:25.320 --> 02:09:34.680
But yeah, Simfile database, not too much right now for that, but I'm thinking though, I mean

02:09:34.680 --> 02:09:41.340
they've already got some Rave songs in there and I'm sure there'll be Max remixes in here

02:09:41.340 --> 02:09:42.340
pretty soon.

02:09:42.340 --> 02:09:44.080
Hey wait a minute, I thought that Mindstyle was gonna have this whole new look when it

02:09:44.080 --> 02:09:45.080
came back.

02:09:45.080 --> 02:09:46.080
It looks the same.

02:09:46.080 --> 02:09:56.080
Well, apparently not. Apparently they lied to us, much like they lied to me when I donated money and said I was going to get special access to an FTP site that never happened.

02:09:56.080 --> 02:09:57.080
Okay.

02:09:57.080 --> 02:09:58.080
So that's why I never donate to them.

02:09:58.080 --> 02:09:59.080
Just curious.

02:09:59.080 --> 02:10:03.080
Oh, oh, here we go. Rave Unlimited. There you go. Max Unlimited remix. Okay.

02:10:03.080 --> 02:10:05.080
Ooh, just what the world needs.

02:10:05.080 --> 02:10:12.320
Alright, now we're going to get to the part of the show where we ask our buddy Xtopher

02:10:12.320 --> 02:10:14.920
to come on and tell us about the movies.

02:10:14.920 --> 02:10:16.320
Did you see a movie this week?

02:10:16.320 --> 02:10:17.320
I did see a movie this week.

02:10:17.320 --> 02:10:20.920
Alright, then you know it's time for Xtopher's Movie Review.

02:10:20.920 --> 02:10:27.800
The Captain, the Captain.

02:10:27.800 --> 02:10:30.440
I just wanted to go, like, stop it.

02:10:30.440 --> 02:10:31.440
Stop playing that song.

02:10:31.440 --> 02:10:32.440
Stop it.

02:10:32.440 --> 02:10:34.440
Okay, so what did you see this week?

02:10:34.440 --> 02:10:46.440
Okay, so I saw Saw 2 and it was bloody. If you like blood and if you like to be scared,

02:10:46.440 --> 02:10:52.440
then Saw 2 is the movie to see. I really was scared. I was genuinely scared at this movie.

02:10:52.440 --> 02:10:56.440
I'm easily scared though at films, so I mean just don't take that from me.

02:10:56.440 --> 02:11:00.440
I mean you may want to take a look at the reviews on RottenTomato.com.

02:11:00.440 --> 02:11:10.440
got like really horrible reviews. I don't know, I've never seen Saw 1, so I've never

02:11:10.440 --> 02:11:22.040
I never saw that, although I want to see Saw for Christmas. But no, it was really cool.

02:11:22.040 --> 02:11:28.380
My sister saw the first one, and she had filled me in on most of the first one before we saw

02:11:28.380 --> 02:11:32.140
the film but i didn't expect the beginning i just didn't like my mouth

02:11:32.140 --> 02:11:36.620
was open i was just like i was horrified it was it was really scary to me

02:11:36.620 --> 02:11:41.820
but um again i'm i'm kind of a pussy when it comes to scary movies rob you

02:11:41.820 --> 02:11:45.660
should know that oh my god yes um oh my god but uh i'm surprised you'll wet your

02:11:45.660 --> 02:11:50.700
pants um at this movie you i've never told you if i have or not i might have

02:11:50.700 --> 02:11:55.740
no kidding um no uh not really i am

02:11:55.740 --> 02:11:59.180
kind of impressed by it i thought it was like silent hill i thought it looked

02:11:59.180 --> 02:12:02.900
like so i had a look at the site looking feel a silent hill the way that it was

02:12:02.900 --> 02:12:06.100
all set up in everything now the other thing about this movie that is incredibly

02:12:06.100 --> 02:12:10.500
extremely and horribly violent like seriously ryland like

02:12:10.500 --> 02:12:11.660
fucking violent

02:12:11.660 --> 02:12:13.480
it is very violent people

02:12:13.480 --> 02:12:15.140
people bleeding all over the place

02:12:15.140 --> 02:12:19.440
but the way the way that places in the way the place looks is just exactly like

02:12:19.440 --> 02:12:22.060
something you see right out of that video game

02:12:22.060 --> 02:12:24.780
and um... i just was very

02:12:24.780 --> 02:12:27.180
very like, just, it was just hard to watch.

02:12:27.180 --> 02:12:29.900
Why don't you tell me something about, like, a trap?

02:12:29.900 --> 02:12:33.860
I don't know if it's a spoiler, but you're saying, like, a trap where razor blades are

02:12:33.860 --> 02:12:35.580
cutting off somebody's arm or something?

02:12:35.580 --> 02:12:36.580
Yeah, it's like...

02:12:36.580 --> 02:12:37.580
It's disgusting.

02:12:37.580 --> 02:12:42.340
It's like a plexiglass box with two openings, and you see, the whole premise is these people

02:12:42.340 --> 02:12:48.020
are poisoned, and they have to find their antidotes to this toxin that they've been

02:12:48.020 --> 02:12:53.280
breathing in for, like, you know, the last two hours, and they're trying to find them

02:12:53.280 --> 02:12:58.540
throughout this house and one of the girls walks into a room with this plexiglass box

02:12:58.540 --> 02:13:03.460
like hanging from the ceiling with two openings where hands can go through and an antidote

02:13:03.460 --> 02:13:09.780
like a, you know, a syringe is in the middle just standing up and she, they're all, you

02:13:09.780 --> 02:13:16.780
know, totally fu- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

02:13:16.780 --> 02:13:22.780
Jamie's about to die from my story. How does it fucking feel to want?

02:13:22.780 --> 02:13:26.780
It's my review, dammit.

02:13:26.780 --> 02:13:28.780
No, I...

02:13:28.780 --> 02:13:30.780
Bloody, bloody, et cetera.

02:13:30.780 --> 02:13:34.780
You know, that's pretty much... I'll talk about it tomorrow. How's about that?

02:13:34.780 --> 02:13:37.780
Okay. Don't listen to my show tomorrow.

02:13:37.780 --> 02:13:39.780
Talk to... or Jamie.

02:13:39.780 --> 02:13:43.780
But no. But listen, because, you know, you want to.

02:13:43.780 --> 02:13:47.780
And so I actually recommend it. I mean, if you don't like...

02:13:47.780 --> 02:13:51.780
If you like violence to the level of pornography level.

02:13:51.780 --> 02:13:55.580
It wasn't, but the thing is, I didn't really pay attention to the blood.

02:13:55.580 --> 02:13:56.580
I was genuinely...

02:13:56.580 --> 02:13:59.100
So if you like the guinea pig project, you'll like Saw 2?

02:13:59.100 --> 02:14:02.980
If you like faces of death, you'll probably like Saw 2.

02:14:02.980 --> 02:14:04.980
No, no, no, no, no.

02:14:04.980 --> 02:14:07.260
It was more scary than gory to me.

02:14:07.260 --> 02:14:11.900
I mean, sure, there was blood, you know, and that's just a given in a movie like that,

02:14:11.900 --> 02:14:15.160
but like, it was more, it was scary to me.

02:14:15.160 --> 02:14:18.140
But yeah, it was a good Halloween movie.

02:14:18.140 --> 02:14:19.140
Happy Halloween!

02:14:19.140 --> 02:14:20.140
So, thumbs up?

02:14:20.140 --> 02:14:21.660
Um, thumbs up for me.

02:14:21.660 --> 02:14:28.780
thumbs cut off really um most likely two stumps up all right all right anyway

02:14:28.780 --> 02:14:33.380
we're gonna go to another break and in this break we're gonna hear some stuff

02:14:33.380 --> 02:14:38.020
from since one of our callers earlier brought up a DDR with Mario I suppose we

02:14:38.020 --> 02:14:41.980
could do some music from a DDR with Mario so we'll do that and we'll be back

02:14:41.980 --> 02:14:46.720
with more Orange Lounge Radio right after this and maybe some more Skype

02:14:46.720 --> 02:14:49.220
calls we can get into it we also definitely have to do the FUs of the

02:14:49.220 --> 02:14:56.060
week and do the cage match winner as well so we'll be number three we'll see

02:14:56.060 --> 02:15:01.060
we'll see all right we'll be back after this with some DDO and Mario music and

02:15:01.060 --> 02:15:08.060
Norges Launch Radio.

02:18:01.060 --> 02:18:03.060
Thanks for watching!

02:20:01.060 --> 02:20:26.980
Here we go!

02:23:19.980 --> 02:23:21.540
While eating locks?

02:23:21.540 --> 02:23:22.540
While eating a box.

Christopher's ex, T as in Tom, O, F as in Frank, E, R as in Robert, at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

02:23:50.860 --> 02:23:51.860
Fun.

02:23:51.860 --> 02:24:00.060
Tuesday nights on Orange Lounge Radio, the one and only Dark Sakura presents Pump Up

02:24:00.060 --> 02:24:01.060
the Volume.

02:24:01.060 --> 02:24:02.300
It's a music request show.

02:24:02.300 --> 02:24:06.940
I've taken to doing it every other Tuesday just because it's cool.

02:24:06.940 --> 02:24:08.380
So you're off this week actually, right?

02:24:08.380 --> 02:24:12.620
This week I will be off, unless I get really bored, and then I might do something, so you

02:24:12.620 --> 02:24:13.620
never know.

02:24:13.620 --> 02:24:18.220
But the week after, I will be back live again.

02:24:18.220 --> 02:24:24.580
And then Wednesday nights on the Orange Lounge radio is the Rob Roberts show, my program,

02:24:24.580 --> 02:24:27.560
where we just kind of sit around and talk about stuff, like last week I went on this

02:24:27.560 --> 02:24:31.780
rant about the future of television and stuff because of podcasting.

02:24:31.780 --> 02:24:35.860
And so it's tech geek fun, and I just play music, and the music I play is whatever the

02:24:35.860 --> 02:24:37.180
fuck I want.

02:24:37.180 --> 02:24:41.660
This week's program, I'll have a very special guest on the show, Rice Princess is coming

02:24:41.660 --> 02:24:43.200
back on Wednesday.

02:24:43.200 --> 02:24:45.420
So it's a Vanilla Sky Reunion.

02:24:45.420 --> 02:24:47.020
It should be a barrel of monkeys laughs.

02:24:47.020 --> 02:24:48.400
It's going to be a fun show.

02:24:48.400 --> 02:24:49.400
So tune in.

02:24:49.400 --> 02:24:51.400
Wednesday night, 7 o'clock.

02:24:51.400 --> 02:24:55.860
Alright, anyway, moving on.

02:24:55.860 --> 02:24:57.860
New topic, Cage Match.

02:24:57.860 --> 02:25:00.820
Let's talk about who won tonight's Cage Match.

02:25:00.820 --> 02:25:05.520
The winner of tonight's cage match was...

02:25:05.520 --> 02:25:07.820
Drumroll. Xtopher, I need a drumroll.

02:25:07.820 --> 02:25:09.820
Thank you.

02:25:09.820 --> 02:25:12.820
The song that won tonight was...

02:25:12.820 --> 02:25:16.820
Pendulum with Hold Your Color.

02:25:16.820 --> 02:25:18.820
Fourth week.

02:25:18.820 --> 02:25:20.820
Retired.

02:25:20.820 --> 02:25:22.820
Retired!

02:25:22.820 --> 02:25:25.820
That is so sad. I mean, you guys...

02:25:25.820 --> 02:25:28.820
Don't you guys care about Captain Jack?

02:25:28.820 --> 02:25:32.820
Didn't he die for your sins?

02:25:32.820 --> 02:25:34.820
Maybe.

02:25:34.820 --> 02:25:37.820
Isn't he going to be coming back soon?

02:25:37.820 --> 02:25:39.820
I mean, come on. Come on, people.

02:25:39.820 --> 02:25:42.820
All right. Get off the show. No, I'm kidding.

02:25:42.820 --> 02:25:44.820
Stop gaying up the show, Extover.

02:25:44.820 --> 02:25:47.820
Well, I'm sorry, Rob. Okay?

02:25:47.820 --> 02:25:50.820
But I thought he was fabulous.

02:25:50.820 --> 02:25:53.820
Here, Loki. Here's your mic.

02:25:53.820 --> 02:25:55.820
I'm just kidding. You don't have to leave.

02:25:55.820 --> 02:25:56.820
Okay.

02:25:56.820 --> 02:25:57.820
That was great.

02:25:57.820 --> 02:25:58.820
Anyway.

02:25:58.820 --> 02:25:59.820
So, there it is.

02:25:59.820 --> 02:26:00.820
The show needs more gay.

02:26:00.820 --> 02:26:01.820
Three new songs.

02:26:01.820 --> 02:26:08.900
New, new, newbie, new, newbie and songs next week.

02:26:08.900 --> 02:26:10.060
I already know what song I'm putting in.

02:26:10.060 --> 02:26:13.820
I'm not allowing Mikul Tov to pick my song next week.

02:26:13.820 --> 02:26:16.940
Actually, is he on?

02:26:16.940 --> 02:26:21.580
I'm going to see if he's on AIM right now because I might send him a message letting

02:26:21.580 --> 02:26:22.580
him know.

02:26:22.580 --> 02:26:27.040
if he is online he's too good to be listening to this program but I want to

02:26:27.040 --> 02:26:34.240
let him know that he won oh he's not online right now denied or he blocked me

02:26:34.240 --> 02:26:38.640
now one or the other all right so anyway moving on then I think now would be an

02:26:38.640 --> 02:26:43.640
appropriate time to do our FUs of the week what do you guys think it is it time

02:26:43.640 --> 02:26:48.440
to get a little bit angsty is it getting angsty in here is it just me all right

02:26:48.440 --> 02:26:54.440
Let's get into the FUs of the Week, and DarkSakura has a new theme song for the FUs of the Week this week.

02:26:54.440 --> 02:26:56.440
Who said you could change your song?

02:26:56.440 --> 02:26:57.440
I did!

02:26:57.440 --> 02:26:58.440
Alright.

02:26:58.440 --> 02:26:59.440
Meow.

02:26:59.440 --> 02:27:00.440
Meow.

02:27:00.440 --> 02:27:01.440
Alright.

02:27:01.440 --> 02:27:04.440
DarkSakura, why is it that we do the FUs of the Week every single week?

02:27:04.440 --> 02:27:06.440
Grr, argh.

02:27:09.440 --> 02:27:12.440
Oh, I like this. This is video game sounding.

02:27:14.440 --> 02:27:16.440
Burn, fire, kill, die, burn!

02:27:16.440 --> 02:27:20.440
Dude, it's Schwartzstein. They're pretty cool. I might change it, though.

02:27:20.440 --> 02:27:24.440
But, um, my first F.U. goes to the cage match.

02:27:24.440 --> 02:27:28.440
Um, my second F.U. goes toward, uh, Captain Jack.

02:27:28.440 --> 02:27:32.440
For dying. How dare he.

02:27:38.440 --> 02:27:42.440
Um, no, this isn't schlag work. It's Schwartzstein.

02:27:42.440 --> 02:27:55.440
Another F.U. goes to being tired and another F.U. goes towards basically being slaked on by people.

02:27:56.440 --> 02:27:59.440
As I look across the window.

02:28:00.440 --> 02:28:03.440
I was like going, you know, I'm sorry, I forgot to call you.

02:28:04.440 --> 02:28:06.440
Because I went to my lobster.

02:28:06.440 --> 02:28:18.640
F.U. to Red Lobster for your tasty food that made me stay in the bathroom for an hour.

02:28:18.640 --> 02:28:26.440
And the F.U. to homework, F.U. to having the work to live, that's all, the end.

02:28:26.440 --> 02:28:32.640
Alright, then let's get to Loki's F.Us.

02:28:32.640 --> 02:28:37.120
My first nephew goes to the goddamn slow people that have to be in front of me every time

02:28:37.120 --> 02:28:39.160
I go out driving.

02:28:39.160 --> 02:28:43.160
You know, it's just really retarded people out there that just don't pay attention.

02:28:43.160 --> 02:28:45.680
It's always women on their goddamn cell phones.

02:28:45.680 --> 02:28:50.960
I'm sorry, I have given you plenty of chances to redeem yourself, but everywhere I look,

02:28:50.960 --> 02:28:56.400
there's a goddamn woman on her cell phone driving a stupid SUV, nearly hitting something.

02:28:56.400 --> 02:28:57.400
All the time.

02:28:57.400 --> 02:29:01.920
I mean, literally you cannot go outside without seeing something like that.

02:29:01.920 --> 02:29:08.920
Well, you know what SUV stands for? The stupid, useless vehicle for stupid, useless people.

02:29:31.920 --> 02:29:34.640
in general just um...

02:29:34.640 --> 02:29:38.160
fucked PHP because it was way too damn hard the programming

02:29:38.160 --> 02:29:42.120
and i'm glad i'm done doing that unfortunately you know i'll have to

02:29:42.120 --> 02:29:45.200
come up with something new and

02:29:45.200 --> 02:29:46.240
yeah my job's never done

02:29:46.240 --> 02:29:49.360
and also fuck those stupid people on

02:29:49.360 --> 02:29:53.640
craigslist that want to charge a hundred thirty five dollars for a webpage design

02:29:53.640 --> 02:29:54.560
and

02:29:54.560 --> 02:29:58.040
granted a hundred thirty five dollars for a webpage isn't probably too bad

02:29:58.040 --> 02:29:59.440
if the webpage is good

02:29:59.440 --> 02:30:02.560
you don't look at their examples in the webpage looks like something that even

02:30:02.560 --> 02:30:04.400
myspace would reject

02:30:04.400 --> 02:30:09.120
so i mean wow who the fuck would pay for that stuff and and obviously there has

02:30:09.120 --> 02:30:12.900
been people have paid for that because we see examples on their website

02:30:12.900 --> 02:30:17.000
i say fuck them because you know i could do a way better job so i guess i don't

02:30:17.000 --> 02:30:20.540
know maybe i should

02:30:20.540 --> 02:30:23.700
i'm gonna do a new f u song as well tonight i think

02:30:23.700 --> 02:30:30.700
just like

02:30:31.900 --> 02:30:33.780
uh...

02:30:33.780 --> 02:30:36.900
i'd like to give it up to you uh... don't

02:30:36.900 --> 02:30:38.620
cuba like that

02:30:38.620 --> 02:30:42.940
uh... i'd like to get a few to our uh... apartment complex

02:30:42.940 --> 02:30:46.180
because our apartment complex but can i call them on monday to tell them that

02:30:46.180 --> 02:30:50.620
the washer in the apartment was broken and it took them till today to just

02:30:50.620 --> 02:30:53.200
bring them a new washer you know why it finally happened today

02:30:53.200 --> 02:30:58.100
Because when I called the office, I actually got to speak to the general manager, and it's the only reason it got taken care of today.

02:30:58.100 --> 02:31:00.100
She had my problem fixed in five minutes.

02:31:00.700 --> 02:31:02.900
Seriously, it was just, it was a nightmare.

02:31:02.900 --> 02:31:08.900
And you know, not having a washer is just plain fucking insane.

02:31:09.400 --> 02:31:13.400
You have to like rely on your friends to have time to let you use their washer.

02:31:13.700 --> 02:31:14.100
Yeah.

02:31:14.100 --> 02:31:20.800
You know, because I'm not going to go to no laundromat or whatever to spend money and try to wash and dry my clothes.

02:31:20.800 --> 02:31:25.800
kostjamrh I have another one Rob

02:31:50.800 --> 02:31:53.980
some of our guest FUs started off with DDR Angel.

02:31:53.980 --> 02:31:59.200
Well, I usually don't bitch about a game per se or what happened in the game,

02:31:59.200 --> 02:32:02.580
but this one redeems itself, you see, because

02:32:02.580 --> 02:32:04.860
usually you go into a group and

02:32:04.860 --> 02:32:07.860
hopefully good things happen and you level and all the while whatever.

02:32:07.860 --> 02:32:09.940
This guy was a complete butt-head though,

02:32:09.940 --> 02:32:13.580
because as soon as I rolled on the object that I needed, he was like,

02:32:13.580 --> 02:32:17.380
you don't need that, you're a piece, this, this, this, this. So, you know what, fuck you.

02:32:17.380 --> 02:32:19.140
and um...

02:32:19.140 --> 02:32:21.860
a fuck you to kicking me out of the group

02:32:21.860 --> 02:32:24.420
after you didn't get your way. I mean it was just...

02:32:24.420 --> 02:32:26.920
it was just massive monster player kill.

02:32:26.920 --> 02:32:31.040
Go in the middle of the mob, run out and kill the priest!

02:32:31.040 --> 02:32:35.620
Fuck you. And that's pretty much it.

02:32:35.620 --> 02:32:43.140
So, yeah, that guy needs to be blacklisted and never spoken to again, which I already did, so ha ha ha ha ha.

02:32:43.140 --> 02:32:45.040
And your entire kill too.

02:32:45.040 --> 02:32:47.040
Next to her, your FUs of the week.

02:32:50.040 --> 02:32:56.040
FU to working for a living. I second Dark Soccer's FU.

02:32:56.040 --> 02:33:01.040
I went and applied for another job today, so maybe I'll have two.

02:33:02.040 --> 02:33:07.040
And, you know, I don't know. Like, I'm just not looking forward to working two jobs.

02:33:07.040 --> 02:33:10.040
Especially the job that I applied for is retail.

02:33:10.040 --> 02:33:12.040
And I'm the retail king.

02:33:12.040 --> 02:33:16.040
But if you're going to work at my favorite store and you can get me discounts, I'm so excited.

02:33:16.040 --> 02:33:19.040
That's fucking great for you.

02:33:19.040 --> 02:33:23.040
I, on the other hand, am not really happy for it.

02:33:23.040 --> 02:33:27.040
But, you know, I mean, it's cool. I mean, I just need the extra money.

02:33:27.040 --> 02:33:30.040
So, I mean, in the long run it will be good for me.

02:33:30.040 --> 02:33:34.040
But at the same time, fuck you to working for a living.

02:33:34.040 --> 02:33:38.040
I forgot something. Ow, I just hurt myself.

02:33:38.040 --> 02:33:42.500
you to not having enough time to do artwork and play video games. That's just that.

02:33:42.500 --> 02:33:46.920
Manwhore's getting too expensive, Christopher.

02:33:46.920 --> 02:33:49.000
They are. I mean, you know,

02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:51.080
and I pay the extra

02:33:51.080 --> 02:33:54.860
so that I can, you know, suck their assholes.

02:33:54.860 --> 02:34:01.280
Oh my god! And, you know, that's like a hundred and twenty bucks extra.

02:34:01.280 --> 02:34:03.080
You're cut off. Shut up.

02:34:03.080 --> 02:34:06.160
I'm sorry, but, you know, but

02:34:06.160 --> 02:34:11.160
You know, I think that it's a really horrible thing when you have to charge extra for that.

02:34:11.160 --> 02:34:12.160
Anyway.

02:34:12.160 --> 02:34:13.160
Can you please go to the chat room?

02:34:13.160 --> 02:34:15.160
It's all just jokes, people.

02:34:15.160 --> 02:34:17.160
It's okay to have sexual humor.

02:34:17.160 --> 02:34:19.160
I saw some people in the chat room earlier.

02:34:19.160 --> 02:34:23.160
It's okay, just get over it.

02:34:23.160 --> 02:34:26.160
I'm not going to change, so, you know, leave if you don't like it.

02:34:26.160 --> 02:34:32.160
The views and opinions expressed by Exifer are not necessarily that of the show.

02:34:32.160 --> 02:34:35.160
Misty says, Fuck my schedule for work this week.

02:34:35.160 --> 02:34:38.360
Of all the weeks that I could go in later because my mom is on vacation this week, I

02:34:38.360 --> 02:34:43.360
get scheduled for 8am or earlier.

02:34:43.360 --> 02:34:46.760
John Field says, F you to my car which has it's speedometer messed up.

02:34:46.760 --> 02:34:49.160
It says 55 and police gun says 45.

02:34:49.160 --> 02:34:51.600
Does anyone know where to take this thing to get it fixed?

02:34:51.600 --> 02:34:54.640
I've gone to the local Acura repair shop and they can't fix it.

02:34:54.640 --> 02:34:59.760
For fuck them, so fuck them for not being able to fix their own cars.

02:34:59.760 --> 02:35:06.640

getting uber pissed over me not doing my homework.

02:35:28.400 --> 02:35:30.560
people can have mental issues at times

02:35:30.560 --> 02:35:33.320
instead of just being lazy for now

02:35:33.320 --> 02:35:36.960
F you to etel for having a crappy DSL connection when I was trying to make my

Soccerina says F you to MPQ for teasing me all night long.

02:36:13.480 --> 02:36:14.480

Roz says FU to my health teacher because FUing to him has become a habit.

02:36:40.040 --> 02:36:43.680

02:36:43.680 --> 02:36:47.920

02:36:57.280 --> 02:36:59.280
F you to Sky for not being gay enough.

02:36:59.280 --> 02:37:01.280

02:37:16.280 --> 02:37:19.280
Sephiroth1215 says F you for midterms.

02:37:19.280 --> 02:37:24.280
landing on and before half on and after Halloween for me

02:37:24.280 --> 02:37:31.280
Rene says F you to those cat food packets because the cat food liquid stuff inside goes everywhere

02:37:31.280 --> 02:37:34.280
when you open the damn thing

02:37:34.280 --> 02:37:40.280

F you to having to reconnect to the stream with iTunes since the quality goes down as a result

02:37:44.280 --> 02:37:45.280
I got an I.M. F.U.

02:37:45.280 --> 02:37:46.280
Okay, what's that?

02:37:46.280 --> 02:37:47.280
I'm a Vexer.

02:37:47.280 --> 02:37:48.280
Uh-huh.

02:37:48.280 --> 02:37:54.280
Uh, F.U. to November 22nd, we're having three shitty albums come out on the same day.

02:37:54.280 --> 02:37:58.280
Lindsay Lohan, Jessica Simpson, and Scott Strap of Creed.

02:37:58.280 --> 02:38:00.280
Lindsay Lohan has another album coming out?

02:38:00.280 --> 02:38:01.280
Yeah.

02:38:01.280 --> 02:38:03.280
Who told her she could put out one, let alone two?

02:38:03.280 --> 02:38:04.280
I don't know.

02:38:04.280 --> 02:38:05.280
Bitch.

02:38:05.280 --> 02:38:08.280
Did you hear that she's gonna be making indie films now to get some street cred?

02:38:08.280 --> 02:38:10.280
She's signed up with some indie films.

02:38:10.280 --> 02:38:11.280
Hopefully those indie films-

02:38:11.280 --> 02:38:12.280
Maybe she'll die.

02:38:12.280 --> 02:38:15.680
Hopefully those indie films that are porn will involve lots of nudity.

02:38:15.680 --> 02:38:16.680
Is that what you want?

02:38:16.680 --> 02:38:19.840
I think she should do a remake of the Captain Jack song we heard tonight.

02:38:19.840 --> 02:38:20.840
You think so?

02:38:20.840 --> 02:38:21.840
Yeah, I do.

02:38:21.840 --> 02:38:22.840
It'll be good times.

02:38:22.840 --> 02:38:23.840
All right.

02:38:23.840 --> 02:38:24.840
We're going to...

02:38:24.840 --> 02:38:27.960
Actually, we're going to go to one more break, but there's a purpose behind this break, because

02:38:27.960 --> 02:38:32.840
I wanted to play this for you guys tonight at some point, because I just got this from

02:38:32.840 --> 02:38:36.580
our buddy Miklotov, and he says it's very cool, and I want to play it for you guys.

02:38:36.580 --> 02:38:38.120
It's in the Kiriyamaoka track.

02:38:38.120 --> 02:38:42.320
It's actually System Romance, but it's not the song that we know it from 2DX.

02:38:42.320 --> 02:38:45.040
It's actually a guitar instrumental version.

02:38:45.040 --> 02:38:49.800
It's actually the demo version of System Romance by Kiryamoka, and I think it's available on

02:38:49.800 --> 02:38:53.280
his website in streaming form or something, but we're going to play it for you guys, because

02:38:53.280 --> 02:38:57.760
it rocks and it's a Kiryamoka, so this is going to be our last break for tonight, and

02:38:57.760 --> 02:38:59.280
then when we come back we'll do...

02:38:59.280 --> 02:39:00.280
More news!

02:39:00.280 --> 02:39:01.280
More news.

02:39:01.280 --> 02:39:02.280
Yes.

02:39:02.280 --> 02:39:03.280
Okay.

02:39:03.280 --> 02:39:04.280
More news than it is.

02:39:04.280 --> 02:39:05.960
And maybe some Ask Orange Lounge if we have time?

02:39:05.960 --> 02:39:06.960
Sure.

02:39:06.960 --> 02:39:07.960
If we have time, but we don't know tonight.

02:39:07.960 --> 02:39:12.780
we may not get to do it. So, anyway, here we go, a Kiryamoka with a guitar version of

02:39:12.780 --> 02:39:15.780
system romance. Enjoy!

02:40:12.780 --> 02:40:19.780
I'm in love with you

02:40:19.780 --> 02:40:26.780
I'm in love with you

02:40:26.780 --> 02:40:33.780
I'm in love with you

02:42:03.780 --> 02:42:04.780
I don't know, I don't know

02:42:04.780 --> 02:42:05.780
I don't know

02:42:05.780 --> 02:42:06.780
I don't know

02:44:06.780 --> 02:44:15.220
Q&A with a instrumental version of System Romance.

02:44:15.220 --> 02:44:19.640
I promised somebody that we could do one more call over the Skypline, so we're going to

02:44:19.640 --> 02:44:22.700
go ahead and go to the Skypline for one last call before we get to some more news.

02:44:22.700 --> 02:44:23.700
Hi, you're on Orange Laundry Radio.

02:44:23.700 --> 02:44:24.700
Hey, Sky, it's John Field.

02:44:24.700 --> 02:44:25.700
Hey, John, what's on your mind?

02:44:25.700 --> 02:44:26.700
I'm doing okay.

02:44:26.700 --> 02:44:27.700
What's on your mind tonight?

02:44:27.700 --> 02:44:34.700
Well, I've got a pretty big announcement to make.

02:44:34.700 --> 02:44:35.700
Okay.

02:44:35.700 --> 02:44:49.700
A couple months back, I made an announcement on Orange Lounge Radio, the official announcement about it, that I would be starting up a Phantasy Star Online Mishima, and I've got good news about that.

02:44:49.700 --> 02:44:55.700
The first episode will be released tomorrow, and I'll be posting a link to it in the chat room.

02:44:55.700 --> 02:45:00.700
Oh, very cool. Now, explain for those that might not know, what is a Mishima?

02:45:00.700 --> 02:45:13.700
A machima is basically the idea of taking a video game, using the characters in it, and using that to tell a story that's different from what the actual game is like. Sort of like what Red vs. Blue did for Halo.

02:45:13.700 --> 02:45:18.700
Right, and I remember I saw a commercial on TV the other day that was The Sims 2, and it was a very similar kind of thing.

02:45:18.700 --> 02:45:24.700
So a lot of folks like that Red vs. Blue stuff, so now you made one for Phantasy Star Online.

02:45:24.700 --> 02:45:25.700
Yeah.

02:45:25.700 --> 02:45:26.700
Very cool, what's it called?

02:45:26.700 --> 02:45:32.700
It's called The Monster Within, and the first episode, like I said, will be out tomorrow.

02:45:32.700 --> 02:45:36.700
If it's not up on archive.org, I'll be hosting it on my own web space.

02:45:36.700 --> 02:45:43.700
And hopefully this will be, maybe every few weeks or so, I'll have another release out.

02:45:43.700 --> 02:45:46.700
Give us a little hint as to the plot of the first episode.

02:45:46.700 --> 02:45:51.700
The plot of the first episode is sort of, it takes place before the actual game starts.

02:45:51.700 --> 02:45:56.700
It's sort of like, you're there seeing the explosion of my goal.

02:45:56.700 --> 02:45:57.700
Hmm.

02:45:57.700 --> 02:46:00.700
Okay, so a little bit of a prequel going on here.

02:46:00.700 --> 02:46:03.700
You going to send this to some folks at SEGA, see what they think of it?

02:46:03.700 --> 02:46:07.700
Actually, I'm already working with a contact inside SEGA.

02:46:07.700 --> 02:46:10.700
It's the GM for Blue Burst, Clumsy Orchid.

02:46:10.700 --> 02:46:11.700
Awesome.

02:46:11.700 --> 02:46:12.700
Well, good luck with that.

02:46:12.700 --> 02:46:13.700
I hope you have a good time.

02:46:13.700 --> 02:46:15.700
And hey, name drop Oren's mom's name somewhere, okay?

02:46:15.700 --> 02:46:16.700
Okay.

02:46:16.700 --> 02:46:17.700
Just messing with you.

02:46:17.700 --> 02:46:18.700
All right, have a good one.

02:46:18.700 --> 02:46:19.700
Thanks for, and good luck with that.

02:46:19.700 --> 02:46:20.700
Let us know how it does.

02:46:20.700 --> 02:46:27.700
the link in the chatroom so we can check it out.

02:46:50.700 --> 02:46:53.500
So we got a lot in here in the last 15 minutes.

02:46:53.500 --> 02:46:54.020
OK.

02:46:54.020 --> 02:46:57.540
Anyways, stuff I was going to be talking about.

02:46:57.540 --> 02:47:00.060
And we posted this to the site earlier this week about this

02:47:00.060 --> 02:47:03.360
new dance game that's coming out by the creators of Get on

02:47:03.360 --> 02:47:03.820
the Mic.

02:47:03.820 --> 02:47:05.860
And it actually used to be called Get on the Floor.

02:47:05.860 --> 02:47:11.140
But now it's Flow, the Urban Dance Uprising.

02:47:11.140 --> 02:47:14.740
This game is the Urban Dance Uprising.

02:47:14.740 --> 02:47:16.300
Yes, Dance Uprising.

02:47:16.300 --> 02:47:20.180
Because Uprising's like a revolution, I guess.

02:47:20.180 --> 02:47:33.180
But it's basically DDR, I mean, in every sense of it. It is so much like DDR that I'm sure we'll see the lawsuit in a few months here, but, um, what can I say? It's all Breakbeat music, which is kinda cool.

02:47:33.180 --> 02:47:44.180
Um, you've got some pretty good tracks, and a lot of them I didn't recognize, cause, I mean, I like Breakbeat and stuff, but I don't really, um, listen to a whole lot of it, so...

02:47:44.180 --> 02:47:48.680
But it's going to be coming out actually the week after

02:47:48.680 --> 02:47:50.220
Ultramix 3

02:47:50.220 --> 02:47:55.980
for, I believe it's only on the Xbox, if I remember correctly.

02:47:55.980 --> 02:48:01.220
But two of the main songs that I wanted to mention was The Breaks by Curtis Blow

02:48:01.220 --> 02:48:05.040
and Eighth Wonder by Sugarhill Gang, which are going to be

02:48:05.040 --> 02:48:06.320
two of the big songs in it.

02:48:06.320 --> 02:48:07.980
Interesting. But it's

02:48:07.980 --> 02:48:09.140
basically BDR.

02:48:09.140 --> 02:48:12.060
Very, very similar.

02:48:12.060 --> 02:48:19.060
So that was the one I wanted to mention, I think that was the only story I had if I remember

02:48:19.060 --> 02:48:20.060
correctly.

02:48:20.060 --> 02:48:21.060
Yeah.

02:48:21.060 --> 02:48:22.060
Okay.

02:48:22.060 --> 02:48:23.060
Just that dance game.

02:48:23.060 --> 02:48:24.540
It'll be interesting to check out.

02:48:24.540 --> 02:48:27.740
I got a couple other things I want to add which I think is very interesting.

02:48:27.740 --> 02:48:33.820
DDR Freak is reporting this week that Carl's Jr., as we know it here on the west coast

02:48:33.820 --> 02:48:36.220
but on the east coast they call it Hardee's, but same thing.

02:48:36.220 --> 02:48:41.080
They're actually going to be running a promotion this November where DDR is going to be advertised

02:48:41.080 --> 02:48:45.160
on their drink cups. But that's very interesting, on their 44 ounce, like their super drink

02:48:45.160 --> 02:48:48.760
cups, they're gonna advertise like DDR games. Which I think is very interesting because

02:48:48.760 --> 02:48:52.320
you consider the types of things that are usually advertised on the side of fast food

02:48:52.320 --> 02:48:56.440
drink cups, and it's like, well, Extrovert, you drink a lot of fast food cups, so what

02:48:56.440 --> 02:48:59.760
kind of... I'm just kidding. I just saw you grab the mic.

02:48:59.760 --> 02:49:01.280
You said Carl's Jr., right? Yes.

02:49:01.280 --> 02:49:04.960
Oh, I love Carl's Jr. Okay, or Hardee's, if you're on the East Coast.

02:49:04.960 --> 02:49:12.240
Hardys. Carl's Jr. is the best. That's pretty good. And I think that makes it even better.

02:49:12.240 --> 02:49:16.760
You know, I once dated somebody who refused to eat at Carl's Jr. because Carl's Jr. was

02:49:16.760 --> 02:49:20.920
giving secret money to anti-gay Republican organizations, supposedly?

02:49:20.920 --> 02:49:25.560
Call me Republican and anti-gay, because I love Carl's Jr.

02:49:25.560 --> 02:49:30.840
Those Western bacons will make me... They are the Western bacon cheeseburger.

02:49:30.840 --> 02:49:35.740
Anyway, so usually they advertise Disney movies on the side of drink cups and whatever else

02:49:35.740 --> 02:49:39.980
is going on, but DDR is going to be a promotion at Carl's Jr. Hardy.

02:49:39.980 --> 02:49:40.980
That's very interesting.

02:49:40.980 --> 02:49:41.980
It is.

02:49:41.980 --> 02:49:42.980
That's interesting.

02:49:42.980 --> 02:49:47.060
Also, here's the thing, inside the store, there's going to be a big advertising standee

02:49:47.060 --> 02:49:51.940
and there'll be $5 coupons attached to the standee, so you can use these $5 coupons for

02:49:51.940 --> 02:49:56.100
Extreme II, UltraMix III, or Karaoke Revolution game.

02:49:56.100 --> 02:49:57.100
Nice.

02:49:57.100 --> 02:49:58.100
Should be interesting.

02:49:58.100 --> 02:49:59.100
Yeah.

02:49:59.100 --> 02:50:00.100
That's going to be kind of cool.

02:50:00.100 --> 02:50:01.100
What?

02:50:01.100 --> 02:50:02.100
That's right.

02:50:02.100 --> 02:50:03.100
Kiriyamaoka Revolution Party's coming up soon.

02:50:03.100 --> 02:50:04.100
That's right.

02:50:04.100 --> 02:50:06.100
I can't wait until we get them here on the show.

02:50:06.100 --> 02:50:07.100
Oh no.

02:50:07.100 --> 02:50:08.100
No.

02:50:08.100 --> 02:50:09.100
No, no, no, no.

02:50:09.100 --> 02:50:11.540
We need a Kiriyamaoka Revolution.

02:50:11.540 --> 02:50:15.500
I keep forgetting that we have international listeners, so they're like, I don't know if

02:50:15.500 --> 02:50:18.740
it's Canada or what, but somebody's all, we don't have arties here, wah!

02:50:18.740 --> 02:50:21.180
You're not missing anything, trust me.

02:50:21.180 --> 02:50:22.180
Their burgers taste like ass.

02:50:22.180 --> 02:50:25.100
Party sells fried chicken.

02:50:25.100 --> 02:50:28.780
And they have like, you know, giant sized burgers that taste like ass.

02:50:28.780 --> 02:50:33.180
me I used to like you know some of their burgers there but there's this one

02:50:33.180 --> 02:50:38.980
Carl's Jr. that was right by our house and it was really really bad there I

02:50:38.980 --> 02:50:43.740
remember the the probably the pinnacle of their suckiness was when the salt

02:50:43.740 --> 02:50:57.460
tasted like urine for some reason. Angel you'd know about that right? Wow. No. No.

02:50:57.460 --> 02:51:02.460
Hardee's is cooler than Carl's Jr. though because they have fried chicken and biscuits.

02:51:02.460 --> 02:51:07.460
I think that they're fine. And if they taste like ass, call me an ass man.

02:51:07.460 --> 02:51:10.460
Because I really like Carl's Jr.

02:51:10.460 --> 02:51:15.460
But, Carl's Jr. has in selected restaurants the green burrito.

02:51:15.460 --> 02:51:18.460
You know, I don't like green burrito. But you know what, I like...

02:51:18.460 --> 02:51:21.460
Shut your mouths, women!

02:51:21.460 --> 02:51:25.460
My fast food of choice better than Carl's Jr. though is Jack in the Box,

02:51:25.460 --> 02:51:28.940
Which I know is also not available in all the states, but it's the best place.

02:51:28.940 --> 02:51:29.940
Yack in the crack.

02:51:29.940 --> 02:51:30.940
Oh, that's great.

02:51:30.940 --> 02:51:35.580
I found out something like a couple weeks ago.

02:51:35.580 --> 02:51:36.580
What?

02:51:36.580 --> 02:51:38.260
About fast food, and...

02:51:38.260 --> 02:51:39.260
It makes you fat?

02:51:39.260 --> 02:51:40.260
I mean, I do that, or what?

02:51:40.260 --> 02:51:41.260
No, no, no, no.

02:51:41.260 --> 02:51:43.260
We have a Chick-fil-A now.

02:51:43.260 --> 02:51:45.260
Oh, come on, fuck-

02:51:45.260 --> 02:51:46.260
Okay, big whoop!

02:51:46.260 --> 02:51:47.260
Honestly-

02:51:47.260 --> 02:51:48.260
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

02:51:48.260 --> 02:51:49.260
I freaking grew up with a Chick-fil-A.

02:51:49.260 --> 02:51:50.260
I know, but I didn't.

02:51:50.260 --> 02:51:51.260
I'm sorry.

02:51:51.260 --> 02:51:52.260
I had an identity, but I didn't.

02:51:52.260 --> 02:51:53.260
What?

02:51:53.260 --> 02:51:55.260
Fuck Chick-fil-A. What's the big deal about Chick-fil-A?

02:51:55.260 --> 02:51:58.260
The crack they put in the Polynesian sauce.

02:51:58.260 --> 02:51:59.260
I like it.

02:51:59.260 --> 02:52:01.260
All Chick-fil-A's are closed on Sunday.

02:52:01.260 --> 02:52:04.260
I know, because they're praising Jesus.

02:52:04.260 --> 02:52:08.260
But no, I think that it's very admirable that they would take a corporate stance for their beliefs.

02:52:08.260 --> 02:52:11.260
I agree, and it's good that the employees at least all get one good day off.

02:52:11.260 --> 02:52:12.260
I hate sores to do that.

02:52:12.260 --> 02:52:17.260
I freaking hate it. Okay, goddamn tugboat, you know, fish and chips, and Nippon.

02:52:17.260 --> 02:52:24.260
Both of the places I love their food, the only time I really have a chance to get some is on Sundays and they have to go freaking warship.

02:52:24.260 --> 02:52:29.260
They can do that in the morning like normal people and they come back to work.

02:52:29.260 --> 02:52:33.780
Some people actually live up to their personal beliefs, maybe?

02:52:33.780 --> 02:52:36.780
No one does that anymore.

02:52:36.780 --> 02:52:39.460
That's so passe.

02:52:39.460 --> 02:52:43.220
I have to commend anyone who's willing to take a stance like that for what they believe

02:52:43.220 --> 02:52:44.220
in.

02:52:44.220 --> 02:52:45.860
I think that it's very admirable.

02:52:45.860 --> 02:52:53.740
The church crowd, when I used to work at Walmart, when they used to come in, I have horrible

02:52:53.740 --> 02:52:59.220
stories there's a worst crowd in the world I swear you're praising Jesus and

02:52:59.220 --> 02:53:04.700
you want you know to be saved yet you want to save more money than you want to

02:53:04.700 --> 02:53:10.380
be saved okay that's all I have you know just let's not let's not start a holy

02:53:10.380 --> 02:53:15.620
war oh I know I don't I grew up in a Christian family I know all about it so

02:53:15.620 --> 02:53:22.340
damn an angel started I'm sorry no because I wanted to play remember being

02:53:22.340 --> 02:53:27.660
religious does not make one moral that's true that is true I just said it cuz I

02:53:27.660 --> 02:53:33.140
thought you guys missed it or something never mind my aims improving um if I'm

02:53:33.140 --> 02:53:36.260
gonna have fast food it's all about Panda Express and I consider Panda

02:53:36.260 --> 02:53:41.260
Express fast food if I'm gonna have fast food then I'll have cooked it the night

02:53:41.260 --> 02:53:44.500
before and take it out of the refrigerator funny you said that Rob

02:53:44.500 --> 02:53:49.780
about Panda Express why all of a sudden I'm thinking of that little cartoon

02:53:49.780 --> 02:53:54.340
thing they have on the World of Warcraft site that says Pandora and Express, and I'm going,

02:53:54.340 --> 02:53:55.340
no!

02:53:55.340 --> 02:53:58.300
Okay, my brain is tainted for the evening, thank you.

02:53:58.300 --> 02:54:02.820
Seriously though, if people who are going to go somewhere the next day, they know that

02:54:02.820 --> 02:54:06.780
they're going to stop to get fast food, isn't it just easier to pack a lunch?

02:54:06.780 --> 02:54:10.340
It's cheaper and better for you.

02:54:10.340 --> 02:54:13.460
I think that everybody should boycott fast food for a week.

02:54:13.460 --> 02:54:14.460
Good.

02:54:14.460 --> 02:54:15.460
I don't want to...

02:54:15.460 --> 02:54:16.460
Get out of my drive-thru.

02:54:16.460 --> 02:54:17.460
No, seriously.

02:54:17.460 --> 02:54:23.940
No seriously, I think that if everybody stopped eating fast food for the duration of one entire

02:54:23.940 --> 02:54:29.100
week, ate regular food, out of the refrigerator, that you go to the grocery store and you have

02:54:29.100 --> 02:54:35.100
to prepare, after a week, I swear, your general level of health and well-being is going to

02:54:35.100 --> 02:54:36.100
be vastly improved.

02:54:36.100 --> 02:54:39.540
I would make a financial wager that I could go, I would make a substantial financial wager

02:54:39.540 --> 02:54:42.300
that I could go longer without fast food than these two.

02:54:42.300 --> 02:54:44.300
Oh, I believe it.

02:54:44.300 --> 02:54:46.700
They wouldn't last five seconds.

02:54:46.700 --> 02:54:52.420
Oh, yeah, right five seconds. Whoo. Okay. I'm going outside

02:54:53.360 --> 02:54:55.360
Is this a bet?

02:54:55.740 --> 02:55:02.260
Yeah, official orange sounds radio bet. Okay, I bet I can go. I am the master of my domain

02:55:02.260 --> 02:55:08.140
I bet I can go six fucking months without eating fast food. I will put money in it

02:55:08.660 --> 02:55:10.660
if you

02:55:11.780 --> 02:55:15.920
Don't believe it. I don't believe that Christopher would be able to okay. We'll do this right now

02:55:15.920 --> 02:55:24.880
now if he breaks his fast food goal then for every month remaining on the six

02:55:24.880 --> 02:55:30.040
months he has to pay $10 so for example if he makes it four months and then eats

02:55:30.040 --> 02:55:37.160
fast food he has to pay 20 bucks to what to us for the station you have to pay

02:55:37.160 --> 02:55:42.760
our station bill you're on I don't need that and shit

02:55:42.760 --> 02:55:44.760
Wait a minute.

02:55:44.760 --> 02:55:48.760
Christopher just agreed to something that Loki and I didn't even say we'd participate in,

02:55:48.760 --> 02:55:51.760
so now it's all Christopher and how long he can go without fast food.

02:55:51.760 --> 02:55:53.760
Loki agrees, too.

02:55:53.760 --> 02:55:56.760
I didn't agree to shit.

02:55:56.760 --> 02:56:01.760
If I don't go and eat fast food, where am I going to get my Best Buy bucks? Really?

02:56:01.760 --> 02:56:03.760
Steal them?

02:56:03.760 --> 02:56:05.760
Yeah, six months.

02:56:05.760 --> 02:56:11.760
See, that's the same type of consumerism crap that's got this country buried, I swear.

02:56:11.760 --> 02:56:13.260
Eh?

02:56:13.260 --> 02:56:17.260
Loki just took out like $20 in Best Buy bucks.

02:56:17.260 --> 02:56:18.260
$22, actually.

02:56:18.260 --> 02:56:20.760
Do you know when the last time I ate fast food was?

02:56:20.760 --> 02:56:21.760
When?

02:56:21.760 --> 02:56:25.760
Two weeks ago, when I bought a salad.

02:56:25.760 --> 02:56:27.760
Okay, now what is considered fast food?

02:56:27.760 --> 02:56:30.760
Because I don't want X to get off on a technicality.

02:56:30.760 --> 02:56:33.760
I don't really consider McDonald's food.

02:56:33.760 --> 02:56:35.760
I'm stepping into a McDonald's.

02:56:35.760 --> 02:56:39.760
Okay, the only thing that you would ever be allowed to buy from a McDonald's would be a salad.

02:56:39.760 --> 02:56:41.260
Okay.

02:56:41.260 --> 02:56:42.560
Cuz their salads are really good.

02:56:42.560 --> 02:56:43.060
Okay, then...

02:56:44.560 --> 02:56:45.060
So...

02:56:45.060 --> 02:56:48.860
So is it any place by a salad, or is it just McDonald's I can buy a salad?

02:56:48.860 --> 02:56:51.060
Any place. If they've got, like, salads...

02:56:51.060 --> 02:56:53.460
Good healthy salads, then that's fine.

02:56:53.460 --> 02:56:54.360
How about this?

02:56:54.360 --> 02:56:56.960
If you go to a place with a drive-thru...

02:56:56.960 --> 02:56:57.660
Yes.

02:56:57.660 --> 02:56:59.160
You can't get anything with meat.

02:56:59.160 --> 02:57:01.660
But, wait, no, cuz that won't work, cuz a chicken salad.

02:57:01.660 --> 02:57:03.560
And... and the apple pie, and...

02:57:03.560 --> 02:57:05.260
Okay, then you can't get anything but a salad.

02:57:05.260 --> 02:57:07.960
The only thing you could give there would be a salad and a drink to go with it.

02:57:07.960 --> 02:57:08.660
Okay.

02:57:08.660 --> 02:57:10.260
Guys are on. I swear.

02:57:10.260 --> 02:57:15.460
I'm gonna I to that tonight and you know is it by my rules of fast food which is

02:57:15.460 --> 02:57:16.020
salad

02:57:16.020 --> 02:57:19.380
also is subway and quiz knows considered fast food

02:57:19.380 --> 02:57:23.300
hello it takes 10 minutes to get fucking sandwich no I don't consider this to be

02:57:23.300 --> 02:57:23.860
fast food

02:57:23.860 --> 02:57:27.740
okay I'm but to raise it up a notch

02:57:27.740 --> 02:57:30.860
I won't even eat those you can have salad

02:57:30.860 --> 02:57:34.180
no I I I do not

02:57:34.180 --> 02:57:38.140
I do not believe you can go six months without I I will not believe it what I

02:57:38.140 --> 02:57:43.420
What are you gonna eat? I'm gonna eat Nippon every night is what you're gonna eat. Isn't Nippon fast food?

02:57:43.420 --> 02:57:47.200
It's Japanese fast food, so I can't even eat that fast food

02:57:47.200 --> 02:57:52.380
It takes like five minutes of repair you can eat you can eat like a regular restaurant like Applebee's or Chili's, okay?

02:57:52.380 --> 02:57:55.900
That's fine. You can get salads from these places

02:57:56.020 --> 02:57:56.540
Okay

02:57:56.540 --> 02:58:01.740
Because salads are good healthy food right, but other than that anything that you eat that you take to work

02:58:01.740 --> 02:58:03.920
You have to take your lunch to work, okay?

02:58:03.920 --> 02:58:09.000
you cannot eat burgers or anything unless you go buy meat and grill

02:58:09.000 --> 02:58:13.320
yourself a burger okay I go to Outback because I have I will seriously do this

02:58:13.320 --> 02:58:17.480
you guys are totally on you guys are totally you guys are gonna be eating my

02:58:17.480 --> 02:58:23.000
ass we'll give you some leeway tomorrow is Halloween you can eat your candy corn

02:58:23.000 --> 02:58:27.360
I'm starting it tonight because I'm starting my dad on the first okay so that

02:58:27.360 --> 02:58:32.800
way I can monitor okay I feel so cool this is gonna be neat so starting on the

02:58:32.800 --> 02:58:38.920
first what's what's halfway through that's gonna be we should have like a

02:58:38.920 --> 02:58:42.640
Biggest Loser competition where every Orange Lawns radio show we have to all

02:58:42.640 --> 02:58:48.840
stand on a weight scale. Well how about this, how about this, we'll go since we're starting here the

02:58:48.840 --> 02:58:55.880
six-month mark will actually be my wedding day so I'm up for this I'm up

02:58:55.880 --> 02:59:00.480
for a Biggest Loser competition okay I will we can do without giving out our

02:59:00.480 --> 02:59:08.720
our weights on the air. It's not really fair to me since I've dropped

02:59:08.720 --> 02:59:13.600
60 pounds since 2003. Then you're the host, you're the moderator.

02:59:13.600 --> 02:59:19.560
I'm the mediator, but I'm participating too. Forget all this other fast food stuff, it's

02:59:19.560 --> 02:59:24.760
just going to be strictly the biggest loser. Whoever loses the most weight in, let's make

02:59:24.760 --> 02:59:29.760
it less than six months, because our listeners don't want to wait that long.

02:59:29.760 --> 02:59:32.320
I also, though, I also, though, I can't rely on weight.

02:59:32.320 --> 02:59:34.480
Being myself, seeing as how, okay,

02:59:34.480 --> 02:59:35.680
I will go ahead and say it on the air,

02:59:35.680 --> 02:59:36.940
I'm a size 12 right now.

02:59:36.940 --> 02:59:40.800
The last time I was a size 12, I was 30 pounds lighter.

02:59:40.800 --> 02:59:44.200
So how about whoever loses the most inches off their waist?

02:59:47.120 --> 02:59:49.280
Whoever loses the most clothing sizes.

02:59:49.280 --> 02:59:50.800
Whoever loses the most, I don't know.

02:59:50.800 --> 02:59:52.000
See, now we're getting too complicated

02:59:52.000 --> 02:59:53.380
and we're running out of show.

02:59:53.380 --> 02:59:55.280
That's easy, it's not dependent on weight,

02:59:55.280 --> 02:59:58.560
it's not dependent on your, really, your metabolism.

02:59:58.560 --> 03:00:02.600
Whoever loses the most clothing sizes.

03:00:02.600 --> 03:00:03.960
I'm still on the fast food thing.

03:00:03.960 --> 03:00:04.960
I swear, though.

03:00:04.960 --> 03:00:05.960
Fast food for me.

03:00:05.960 --> 03:00:06.960
Here it is.

03:00:06.960 --> 03:00:13.880
If Christopher can actually go six months with no fast food, I'm trying to think of something

03:00:13.880 --> 03:00:14.880
I'll do.

03:00:14.880 --> 03:00:15.880
Ew.

03:00:15.880 --> 03:00:16.880
No.

03:00:16.880 --> 03:00:17.880
No.

03:00:17.880 --> 03:00:18.880
No.

03:00:18.880 --> 03:00:19.880
No.

03:00:19.880 --> 03:00:20.880
No.

03:00:20.880 --> 03:00:23.880
All sorts of meat.

03:00:23.880 --> 03:00:24.880
Okay.

03:00:24.880 --> 03:00:29.820
whose mind is in the gutter

03:00:29.820 --> 03:00:32.980
what we'll go ahead and do because there

03:00:32.980 --> 03:00:35.600
it is a good motivated for everybody

03:00:35.600 --> 03:00:41.560
it's just we are also they're going to test the m i

03:00:41.560 --> 03:00:43.360
by me i hate it

03:00:43.360 --> 03:00:46.760
yeah that bm is the most accurate way to test that one

03:00:46.760 --> 03:00:47.760
uh...

03:00:47.760 --> 03:00:51.280
i'm going to get by the m i counter

03:00:51.280 --> 03:00:54.120
hide me will do it by bm i

03:00:54.120 --> 03:00:58.360
Sounds good to me.

03:00:58.360 --> 03:01:02.720
Six months, though, is an awfully long time for this to finish, to play out.

03:01:02.720 --> 03:01:07.760
It's April, right? Isn't it six months April? We, we can go, we can make it.

03:01:07.760 --> 03:01:12.040
You remember how we were saying our lease? I'm not, I am not committing to the

03:01:12.040 --> 03:01:15.720
fast food thing because of my lifestyle. I just know I won't be able to do it. I am

03:01:15.720 --> 03:01:18.280
freely admitting that I will cut back. I'll cut back.

03:01:18.280 --> 03:01:22.120
I will. If we're doing like a physical dessert, I will participate.

03:01:22.120 --> 03:01:26.220
And I'll tell you what, I will make a private live journal community for us,

03:01:26.220 --> 03:01:30.280
but we are going to post running things on the site, and most,

03:01:30.280 --> 03:01:35.740
so without giving any specifics out, and then we'll be able to let our listeners,

03:01:35.740 --> 03:01:39.560
and if our listeners want to participate in this, you know, we'll think of something,

03:01:40.500 --> 03:01:44.180
but I think, you know, because we'd have to have some way to track that,

03:01:44.180 --> 03:01:48.180
but you guys, I'll see you in person, so, but, you know, I encourage our listeners

03:01:48.180 --> 03:01:49.520
to participate with us on their own.

03:01:49.520 --> 03:01:52.520
If you don't let me have diet soda, I'm going to cry.

03:01:52.520 --> 03:01:53.520
Yay!

03:01:53.520 --> 03:01:56.520
So Angel's going to participate. I'm going to do it.

03:01:56.520 --> 03:01:58.520
X-Ray's going to do it. Are you doing it too, Loki?

03:01:58.520 --> 03:02:00.520
I'm going to eat all fast food!

03:02:00.520 --> 03:02:02.520
Shut up! No you're not.

03:02:02.520 --> 03:02:03.520
Yes I am!

03:02:03.520 --> 03:02:05.520
You're going to be the biggest gainer?

03:02:09.520 --> 03:02:11.520
Well that's a good W.

03:02:11.520 --> 03:02:13.520
Oh no!

03:02:13.520 --> 03:02:17.520
Okay, so Angel, myself, and X-Ray will be the biggest losers.

03:02:17.520 --> 03:02:23.520
Which means I have to tell the entire house when I get back, no faster than six months!

03:02:23.520 --> 03:02:25.520
And they're going to give me like...

03:02:25.520 --> 03:02:31.520
And to encourage everybody, if anyone wants to go work out, if I'm free, I'll work out with you.

03:02:31.520 --> 03:02:34.520
I'm doing all my own too.

03:02:34.520 --> 03:02:36.520
I can encourage everybody.

03:02:36.520 --> 03:02:38.520
And we're getting a metal pad, so I'll be fine.

03:02:38.520 --> 03:02:40.520
Six months is too damn long.

03:02:40.520 --> 03:02:46.400
you know it though I want to one of the reasons why I'm doing it is because I

03:02:46.400 --> 03:02:50.880
want to see what kind of benefits this will this will give me you know in terms

03:02:50.880 --> 03:02:55.280
of financial because I know that a lot of money because you know living in an

03:02:55.280 --> 03:03:00.560
apartment and you know this whole lifestyle is spent on that food and of

03:03:00.560 --> 03:03:05.920
course health wise it'll be good and I think that overall it'll be a good thing

03:03:05.920 --> 03:03:11.680
so I say six months and I will be committed to it I won't drink I can't I

03:03:11.680 --> 03:03:18.120
can't drink anyway so I mean it's kind of cool anyway hello okay my microphone

03:03:18.120 --> 03:03:22.440
works okay we're going way too far so I do not think the six months because if

03:03:22.440 --> 03:03:25.080
you do it for six months you're eventually gonna get yourself into some

03:03:25.080 --> 03:03:29.760
healthier habits anyway how the hell do we get into this topic anyway it's just

03:03:29.760 --> 03:03:31.760
happened it was his fault

03:03:31.760 --> 03:03:35.000
yes

03:03:35.000 --> 03:03:35.900
extrovert

03:03:35.900 --> 03:03:37.380
well let's talk about

03:03:37.380 --> 03:03:41.440
food banks who want some uh... supersized fried

03:03:41.440 --> 03:03:45.620
and sounds good right now brother fucking disgusting thank you

03:03:45.620 --> 03:03:48.760
i know i was like she was planning on showing up at godary

03:03:48.760 --> 03:03:51.500
dammit i was planning on getting pizza head after the show tonight now i have

03:03:51.500 --> 03:03:54.860
to set a fucking example of my roommate who just made a fucking stupid bet

03:03:54.860 --> 03:04:00.240
i don't know how i've been looking for every month you have failed ten dollars

03:04:00.240 --> 03:04:03.800
you pay for the show we're going to think of a prize that you

03:04:03.800 --> 03:04:06.200
if you make it

03:04:06.200 --> 03:04:08.980
i will take you out to dinner

03:04:08.980 --> 03:04:10.820
wherever you want whatever you want it

03:04:10.820 --> 03:04:15.120
you're not going to change your lifestyle for six months for a fucking free dinner

03:04:15.120 --> 03:04:17.220
that it sounds good to me

03:04:17.220 --> 03:04:19.420
i think you know it you you had

03:04:19.420 --> 03:04:20.660
free dinners

03:04:20.660 --> 03:04:24.340
pretty good when you're living on your own you know you know what i mean

03:04:24.340 --> 03:04:29.300
Alright, alright, so, yeah, I can see Loki, like, every week coming in with a big old

03:04:29.300 --> 03:04:30.300
burger in front of it.

03:04:30.300 --> 03:04:33.180
I will think of a prize as well to sweeten up at the pot.

03:04:33.180 --> 03:04:34.180
Okay.

03:04:34.180 --> 03:04:35.180
Okay.

03:04:35.180 --> 03:04:36.780
I'll take it or not, sir.

03:04:36.780 --> 03:04:37.780
That sounds good.

03:04:37.780 --> 03:04:41.140
I'm gonna switch from single quarter pounders to double quarter pounders.

03:04:41.140 --> 03:04:47.100
I was gonna say something, but, like, I'll just do that out there.

03:04:47.100 --> 03:04:48.260
End of show.

03:04:48.260 --> 03:04:49.260
Final thoughts.

03:04:49.260 --> 03:04:51.940
Angel, your final thought.

03:04:51.940 --> 03:04:53.220
I think I can do this.

03:04:53.220 --> 03:04:58.220
We'll have to go yell at the roomies at home and tell them, no fast food, ever.

03:04:58.220 --> 03:05:01.220
Next up for our final thought.

03:05:01.220 --> 03:05:07.220
Oh, if somebody in chat wanted to hear the drum roll one more time.

03:05:07.220 --> 03:05:10.220
Thank you.

03:05:10.220 --> 03:05:14.220
That sounds like a really messed up warlock, I mean, murloc.

03:05:14.220 --> 03:05:15.220
Addict.

03:05:15.220 --> 03:05:17.220
I am Sam Drumroll or something.

03:05:17.220 --> 03:05:19.220
Low key, your final thought.

03:05:19.220 --> 03:05:29.220
My final thought is, this is the perfect week for me to actually roll out my hybrid beef-slash-sausage hamburger with double bacon, double cheese.

03:05:30.220 --> 03:05:31.220
Yummy.

03:05:31.220 --> 03:05:33.220
I'm gonna fuckin' be sick.

03:05:33.220 --> 03:05:38.220
You know what? Here it is. Six months. If you can go six months, I'll buy you a fuckin' DS.

03:05:39.220 --> 03:05:41.220
Shit. I'm not gonna try that.

03:05:41.220 --> 03:05:42.220
Okay.

03:05:42.220 --> 03:05:43.220
I'll give you like ten bucks.

03:05:43.220 --> 03:05:46.220
I'll give you a fuckin' DS if you can go six months.

03:05:46.220 --> 03:05:47.220
Okay.

03:05:47.220 --> 03:05:48.220
I'll buy you a puppy.

03:05:48.220 --> 03:05:52.280
uh...

03:05:52.280 --> 03:05:55.740
uh... my final thought would be uh...

03:05:55.740 --> 03:05:57.220
experts crazy

03:05:57.220 --> 03:05:59.660
uh...

03:05:59.660 --> 03:06:04.140
uh... reject of icons and even better reject fast food

03:06:04.140 --> 03:06:04.860
uh...

03:06:04.860 --> 03:06:06.200
package that room

03:06:06.200 --> 03:06:08.240
package that room

03:06:08.240 --> 03:06:11.820
there's going to be a betting pool for the fucking biggest loser contest

03:06:11.820 --> 03:06:13.440
revenue

03:06:13.440 --> 03:06:15.140
that on me

03:06:15.140 --> 03:06:18.340
I think I already won since I did drop 60 pounds.

03:06:18.340 --> 03:06:20.380
Which you're not participating in this competition.

03:06:20.380 --> 03:06:22.780
I'm monitoring because I'm the health guru of the station.

03:06:22.780 --> 03:06:23.780
You're setting an example.

03:06:23.780 --> 03:06:24.780
I'm the example.

03:06:24.780 --> 03:06:25.780
I'm so cool.

03:06:25.780 --> 03:06:26.780
Odds are in.

03:06:26.780 --> 03:06:32.260
Loki is 99 to 1 odds.

03:06:32.260 --> 03:06:33.260
God I love you guys.

03:06:33.260 --> 03:06:34.500
I'm going to get in on that action.

03:06:34.500 --> 03:06:35.900
I fucking love you guys.

03:06:35.900 --> 03:06:36.900
Alright.

03:06:36.900 --> 03:06:37.900
Seriously?

03:06:37.900 --> 03:06:40.020
Chat room you people make this show and everybody that listens.

03:06:40.020 --> 03:06:41.940
We love you chat room.

03:06:41.940 --> 03:06:42.940
Alright.

03:06:42.940 --> 03:06:48.620
motivate us to be thin. Actually, I have one other thing. For all of my fellow Gorillaz

03:06:48.620 --> 03:06:55.620
fans, they're broadcasting the Manchester show on BBC One, streaming. BBC One! BBC

03:06:55.620 --> 03:07:02.620

I'll teach you to be happy.

03:08:12.980 --> 03:08:15.860

The little critters of nature.

03:08:39.260 --> 03:08:41.720
They don't know they are ugly.

03:08:41.720 --> 03:08:43.420
That's very funny a

03:08:43.420 --> 03:08:45.500
A butterfly marrying a bumblebee

03:08:46.400 --> 03:08:48.080
I told you I'd shoot

03:08:48.080 --> 03:08:50.000
But you didn't believe me

03:08:50.000 --> 03:08:52.100
Why didn't you believe me?

03:08:53.440 --> 03:09:01.780
Happy, happy, joy, joy

03:09:01.780 --> 03:09:03.400
Happy, happy, joy, joy.

03:09:03.400 --> 03:09:10.400
Happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, joy, joy, joy.

03:09:10.400 --> 03:09:17.400
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.

03:09:40.400 --> 03:10:01.120
kostjamrh The guys just did their weigh-ins for the, uh,

03:10:01.120 --> 03:10:06.120
We're not going to say our weight, because the whole idea is that we don't have to say our weight, but oh my God, I was surprised.

03:10:06.120 --> 03:10:10.120
I hit a certain landmark that I didn't think I was over yet, and I'm like, oh, fuck.

03:10:10.120 --> 03:10:14.120
All right, so we'll see what happens.

03:10:14.120 --> 03:10:17.120
Did I really tell ExtraFryd buy him a DS? God, I'm poor.

03:10:17.120 --> 03:10:20.120
Yes, you did. We have proof of that.

03:10:20.120 --> 03:10:25.120
That's fine. If he can go six months without fast food, he earned it, and I bet you anything, Jay will get in on that, too.

03:10:25.120 --> 03:10:26.120
I'll bet you anything.

03:10:26.120 --> 03:10:31.120
I'm telling you right now, I'm at a plateau right now where I can eat as much fast food as I want, and I stay the same weight, so you know what?

03:10:31.120 --> 03:10:33.120
To be fair, you can see what I'm at.

03:10:33.120 --> 03:10:35.120
Okay, okay.

03:10:35.120 --> 03:10:36.120
That's what I'm at.

03:10:36.120 --> 03:10:40.120
Okay. Oh, you are going to participate too then, Ms. J?

03:10:40.120 --> 03:10:42.120
As a motivator for everybody.

03:10:42.120 --> 03:10:45.120
I can't lose. So we're going to track this on the website, like how much weight we all...

03:10:45.120 --> 03:10:47.120
I'm not eligible for any prizes.

03:10:47.120 --> 03:10:52.120
I'm still moderating it, so I'm not eligible for any prizes, but I'm doing it for motivation purposes.

03:10:52.120 --> 03:10:54.120
It's going to be a crazy six months, gang.

03:10:54.120 --> 03:10:57.740
yeah but I've needed to do it since I met you guys so you know what

03:10:57.740 --> 03:11:01.900
it's time to go. One thing though that you need to point this out

03:11:01.900 --> 03:11:06.080
just having come to this myself, I went from 255

03:11:06.080 --> 03:11:10.440
I don't mind saying it, I'm at 195 now and I did that in two years

03:11:10.440 --> 03:11:13.920
I did that in two years so if I can do that

03:11:13.920 --> 03:11:17.120
in two years and I lost the bulk of it in my first six months

03:11:17.120 --> 03:11:20.140
so trust me, you weren't able to do it

03:11:20.140 --> 03:11:22.640
If everybody stays on, it's going to be easy.
