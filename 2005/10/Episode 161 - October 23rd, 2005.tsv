356132	358774	And, you know, the same crap you've come to know and love.
358894	360555	Because Captain Jack would have wanted it that way.

487161	498524	You're tuned in to Orange Lounge Radio, radio the gamers really want, and this is Orange Lounge Radio Live, your home for all the news and discussion on rhythm and music games, as well as the gamer community and the pop culture world.
498984	503405	Plugged in and fully interactive through our website at www.orangeloungeradio.com.
504133	504973	My name is Rob Roberts.
504993	506054	You might know me as Sky.
506334	509036	Not joining us tonight is the lovely DarkSakura.
509056	510016	She has the night off.
510976	514738	But filling in instead is the one and only Xtifer.
515099	515659	Yo, yo.
516139	519341	Who is promised to be at least PG-13 tonight?
520341	525164	I will only talk about, you know, the possible showing of boobs and ass.
525384	526684	Okay, that's good.
527025	527925	Nothing else to promise.
528085	528485	Sounds good.
529646	532527	Also joining us, of course, the one and only Loki.
533128	533628	Yeah, I'm here.
534517	534977	How you doing?
535277	535478	Good?
535818	535978	Good.
536658	536959	All right.
537319	544263	Well, tonight, obviously, tonight's show is dedicated to the one and only Captain Jack, because he's the man.
544823	547145	We'll talk a little more about the captain when we come back.
547485	550847	But, of course, it's only appropriate that we play some Captain Jack songs tonight.
551788	557231	I don't know how many we're going to play, but certainly through these first few breaks, we're going to pay some tribute to Captain Jack.
557952	559813	And we're going to start it off with one of my favorites.
559893	560433	This is the one.
560773	561614	I remember this song.
562998	565657	From DDR4th Mix, and it's the song that...
566718	570379	Everybody, at least in this area, the Sacramento people, used to really get down to.
570680	572280	And, I mean, literally.
572760	575541	And it had such a fun little dance to it.
576122	581384	And people would kind of, the lyrics kind of have you sing along with it and do a little dance.
581724	584405	And it was really cheesy and we all looked drunk and stupid.
584825	587406	But, you know what, Captain Jack songs were all about fun.
587626	590307	And this is one of the most fun songs I can think of.
590327	592248	So we're going to start off this break with Only You.
592728	595089	And we'll be back with more Orange Lounge Radio after this.
597809	604739	This is radio station CJ Boogie with a brand new world premiere song from Captain Jack, Only You.
680202	681123	Thanks for watching!
762697	766780	Only you can make me feel so true I'll never, never be so blue As long as I have you
820069	821730	Celebrate Holiday Celebrate
990825	993387	The Step Squad to Orange Lab!
993787	995669	This PDR sucks!
995749	998071	Holla for the new level 7!
998111	998371	TTPO!
1004824	1005505	Welcome back, kids.
1005725	1008228	We're here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 161.
1008308	1014435	In that break, we heard Only You by Captain Jack from DDR4thMix and Captain Jack with Holiday, the radio mix.
1015116	1019581	Tonight, of course, we played a couple of long versions there, which we don't usually do during our breaks.
1019761	1022844	But tonight, I think we have an excuse to be a little bit different.
1023005	1023705	So there you have it.
1024726	1039660	I promised our chat room, which by the way is swinging tonight over at www.orangeloungeradio.com clicking on chat, I promised them that we would have a major announcement regarding interactivity and the show a little bit before the program started and I'm going to reveal that right now.
1041089	1041890	Here's the big news.
1043411	1049215	As you know, we have the Skype line that allows you to contact us and we can talk to you on air.
1050256	1054319	But sometimes we have a lot of problems with the Skype line with people being able to talk to us.
1054759	1056420	They can't hear us or we can't hear them.
1056801	1059963	And there's the internet lag or something's going on, so it acts really funny.
1061084	1063706	So what we've done... Excuse me.
1064166	1064246	Ah.
1066161	1068383	I'm burping here because I just had Sprite during the break.
1068863	1069664	Don't choke, Rob.
1070164	1072326	The worst is McDonald's french fries burped there.
1072346	1081192	Anyway, so what we did is we've actually purchased an add-on to Skype that will allow you to call us on a regular telephone and say hello to us.
1081632	1082713	So here's the thing, though.
1082913	1087777	Not only is it a regular phone so you can give us a call and talk to us, but it's also a message line.
1088297	1092280	So if you want to call and leave us a message at any time, you can, and we can play that on the show.
1092380	1092861	So we thought...
1093806	1103512	With the news regarding Captain Jack, and I'm sure a lot of people have something they want to say, we thought we could open up this brand new thing and allow you guys to call in right now, leave some messages, and we'll play them later in the show.
1103952	1111317	But of course, now guys, try to keep it, you know, it is a three hour show, so we're kind of looking for, you know, what's your feedback on how
1112357	1112958	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1131129	1132830	Thank you for watching.
1156963	1158866	So you don't just have to have Skype to call in.
1158886	1164392	You can actually call us using a regular telephone as long as you're cool with paying long distance charges.
1164653	1166876	Or use a cell phone because you've got all those minutes.
1167396	1168157	Free long distance.
1168197	1168578	Exactly.
1170961	1173524	Alright, so once again, the phone number, area code 916-226-9067.
1178397	1180218	I'm putting that in chat right now.
1180238	1182178	916-226-9067.
1183259	1192001	Anyway, before we get into how was your week, how was your day, obviously the big pink elephant sitting in the room right now is Extifer.
1192181	1193962	No, is the fact that...
1195780	1200823	Captain Jack obviously passed away this week, which, you know, sucks.
1202404	1203185	How else do you say it?
1203245	1203685	It sucks.
1204406	1218334	He suffered a second stroke, apparently he had a stroke a couple years ago, and he had a second stroke, and when he suffered the second stroke, apparently he was at a party in full uniform, because I don't think a picture of Captain Jack exists where he was not in his full uniform, which is part of what made him so awesome.
1219443	1220844	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
1241101	1243763	So anyway, I thought maybe we could go around before we do a little bit.
1243783	1244184	How was your week?
1244204	1244784	How was your day?
1245024	1247226	And what do you think about all that?
1247246	1248467	What did you think of Captain Jack?
1248487	1250169	What do you think about Captain Jack and DDR?
1250469	1251490	What do you think about the music?
1252951	1254012	Anything you guys want to say?
1254392	1255974	And we'll start it off with Loki.
1257780	1275884	Um, well, I was surprised to hear they'd passed away, um, because I remember the whole morning I was trying to see what his condition was, and a lot of people were, because they were getting sources from, like, a German site, so translating German, we weren't sure if it was, you know, still in coma, or passed away, or just like, you know.
1276264	1283806	So once he figured it out, you know, and the news hit everybody, um, you know, it was, you know, very surprising, that's for sure.
1284326	1285226	Um, the guy's
1286334	1313506	I don't know, I wasn't a particular fan of his music, I mean, he was in the category of songs that are quite annoying to be played over and over and over in DDR, so it wasn't bad, but it wasn't, you know, he wasn't as horrible as, say, like, you know, DJ Alligator or something like that, so it was still fun, his songs were fun, and he just, I mean, he's definitely stayed true to himself, I mean, he's just very, you know, out there, you know, not...
1314454	1315135	Thank you for watching!
1338283	1339504	Angel, anything you want to say about it?
1339524	1341044	Angel, anything you want to say about it?
1368584	1370826	I'm not quite sure on that, but I think so.
1371106	1377691	So, that's the first time that I ever played one of his songs, and, you know, I still like him, and, you know, good stuff.
1378612	1381634	And I'm sorry to hear that he did pass away this week.
1382134	1383255	That was kind of a shocker.
1383315	1391601	Actually, DJ Ranma S, one of our buddies, told me on AIM, we were, like, talking and stuff, and he was like, hey, did you hear him?
1391621	1392062	I'm like, what?
1392082	1392942	Huh?
1393262	1397986	So he, like, linked me to it, to the website that was announcing that he was in a coma and stuff, and
1398556	1399277	It's just sad.
1400538	1400798	Sad.
1401399	1401639	Okay.
1402239	1402780	I'll shut up now.
1405537	1419426	I kind of see Captain Jack as one of the three big artists in the beginnings of DDR, the other two being SmileDK and Erotic, because those three bands kind of showed up in every early mix and continue to show up in a lot of DDR mixes today.
1420667	1429092	And where SmileDK is kind of bubblegum pop girl stuff and Erotic is... I don't know what the hell you call Erotic.
1429613	1431414	Captain Jack is quite simply the shit.
1431954	1432795	Captain Jack is the shit.
1432995	1433495	He's the man.
1435797	1459998	I mean, a little bit eccentric, yes, but that's cool, because his music was just a lot of dumb fun, and I know, and that's kind of what DDR is all about, DDR is kind of dumb fun, and so Captain Jack, you know, he just wants to be surrounded by hot bitches and dance, that's really what Captain Jack was all about, was hot bitches and dancing, and, you know, I think that's awesome, and
1461300	1465123	That's just what DDR is all about, is having fun, and I think that's what Captain Jack's music was all about, is fun.
1465443	1466504	Is it ever going to win a Grammy?
1466584	1466825	No.
1467245	1471328	Is it, you know, the Oscar-winning soundtrack music?
1471428	1471728	No.
1471949	1474411	Is it even critically acclaimed ever?
1474531	1474731	No.
1474831	1480776	It's just, it's fun, mindless, happy, bouncy music, and that's what DDR is all about.
1481596	1482657	So that's why Captain Jack's the man.
1483198	1490984	What made it ironic about the whole thing was last week when I, after the show, I decided to go out in the living room
1491912	1495535	and, uh, play, uh, EX2 for the first time.
1496556	1505283	And, uh, the song that's on there was one of the first ones I actually played, so hearing what happened, you know, earlier this week, I was like, what?
1506404	1512469	So, I don't know, it's just kind of, kind of, uh, well, yeah, like I said, ironic, so, I don't know.
1513249	1513770	It was just weird.
1513790	1514751	It's like, wait.
1514771	1514971	Wait.
1516667	1520829	XFR, I would ask you, but I know you don't play enough DDR to probably even know who Captain Jack is.
1520849	1521729	The guy that died?
1521749	1522950	I'm guessing.
1523070	1524471	Yes, he is the guy that died this week.
1524511	1525671	Oh, okay.
1526111	1526992	My condolences.
1527352	1528312	Okay.
1529153	1535255	You know, it's pretty interesting how the Bumani community and the music gaming community in general has kind of been responding.
1535596	1545140	I know the article that Loki posted on it, I don't know if it made the runarounds and blogs and stuff, but the story about Captain Jack's passing has had more hits than...
1545760	1546460	and many more.
1567822	1570104	And another thing I could point out is, you know, you often wonder
1595883	1600185	If I ever pass away, will people find out about it and stuff like that?
1600465	1605307	I wonder if he wondered the same thing, because now look at the response after he passed away and stuff.
1605367	1607788	Kind of interesting.
1607848	1614111	I bet no record company here in this country had any idea how big of a following Captain Jack really had in this country.
1614971	1616252	It's kind of amazing.
1619073	1619853	I don't know what else to say.
1619953	1624455	I don't want to turn this into a three-hour sobfest, because honestly, that's not what Captain Jack was all about.
1625798	1628480	Yeah, he wants us to party, so let's like...
1639406	1640807	Okay, hot female dogs.
1640967	1641448	Okay, cool.
1641488	1641888	Yeah, yeah.
1643229	1644110	Release the dogs.
1644530	1645531	Release the hounds.
1645771	1657341	Alright, again, if you want to call and leave a message on our message line, it's 916-226-9067 and we'll be playing some of your messages and your thoughts about Captain Jack a little later in the program.
1660063	1661724	What else did I want to say on the whole thing?
1661864	1672190	Oh, yes, of course, we had some requests if we could maybe play a little something and just kind of give Captain Jack an appropriate 21-gun salute.
1673290	1679053	So we're going to give Captain Jack a 21-gun salute, or somebody suggested in the chat room, actually, a 21-arrow salute.
1680114	1681354	So however you want to...
1682819	1683339	Imagine it.
1683799	1688321	We're going to give Captain Jack a moment of silence, an Orange Launch Radio moment of silence, and a 21-gun salute.
1688381	1691883	So if you would all please, a moment of silence and a salute.
1727202	1735209	and to that you know Captain Jack would have followed up with GO LEFT GO RIGHT GO RIGHT GO LEFT GO LEFT GO LEFT GO RIGHT GO LEFT
1748316	1751238	Let's get into Orange Lounge Radio and what we're all about.
1751378	1753879	Hello kids who are listening to us, maybe for the first time.
1754859	1761782	We're a radio program about the music games and video gaming in general, but sometimes we like to talk about ourselves.
1761822	1765184	It's kind of like imagine if you were going out to Denny's after the football game.
1766084	1768585	Sure, you talk about the football game a little bit, but you talk about other stuff too.
1768765	1771286	And that's what we're all about here at Orange Lounge, just sitting around having a good time.
1771727	1774888	So one way we just kind of do that is by talking about our weeks and our days.
1775368	1778770	So we're going to talk about your week and your day and what's been up and what's been going on.
1778790	1782912	We'll start off tonight with DDR Angel, if you wouldn't mind starting us off with how was your week, how was your day?
1783272	1785154	Sure, that's not a problem.
1785414	1785614	Yeah.
1786414	1788996	Well, the week was alright.
1789216	1795159	I spent Monday and Tuesday kind of trying to get my computer back online and stuff like that.
1795179	1802803	I finally got to that point at early Wednesday morning before class.
1803123	1803844	Okay.
1804518	1809840	and so that's all fine and good now and I can finally play all the games that I want to play.
1810160	1819323	Today was pretty much spent catching up on World of Warcraft because I hadn't done it all week thanks to said computer.
1820604	1823945	Other than that I picked up EX2 this week.
1823965	1828507	I haven't gotten to play it yet but I shall get to that shortly.
1830583	1832605	Other than that, it's been a really quiet week.
1833186	1844898	Oh, I picked up a, um, people are going to shoot me for this, but I ended up going to the bookstore and stumbling upon a Warcraft manga.
1847696	1848197	Nerd!
1849297	1849798	Nerd!
1851339	1853480	Fucking Warcraft manga, nerd!
1854140	1854580	Hey!
1855921	1858523	I don't know, I saw it and I was like, okay, um, mine.
1858983	1861164	So let's see, let's see the story.
1861525	1864907	Let's see, the World of Warcraft, no, this isn't World of Warcraft, this is Warcraft.
1864947	1866207	Actually it is, I think.
1866628	1869830	World of Warcraft, the Sunwell Trilogy.
1870959	1876121	It's an epic quest to save the world of Azeroth from the forces of the Undead Scourge.
1876821	1892427	Warcraft, the Sunworld Trilogy, chronicles the adventures of Kalec, a blue dragon who has taken human form to investigate a mysterious power, and Anveena, a beautiful young maiden with an enchanting secret.
1895442	1898624	and volume number two will be out in March of 2006.
1899064	1901026	So that's a sex novel then, huh?
1901186	1902407	No, it's not a sex novel.
1902507	1902827	Oh, okay.
1903047	1903427	Oh dear.
1904508	1905489	What did I walk into?
1905509	1906189	Oh wait.
1907450	1911352	Actually, yeah, so I bought that and he caught in a go.
1912679	1915580	Yeah, I bought all those too, but you probably don't know that.
1915720	1916940	Oh, go read Shonen Jump.
1916980	1917220	Jeez.
1919641	1920121	Okay.
1920141	1922541	Yeah, well, it's in there.
1922601	1924762	Anyway, yeah, I bought manga this week.
1924902	1925362	Okay, anyway.
1925382	1925862	It's all good.
1925962	1926402	It's all good.
1927062	1928062	Whatever you're into.
1928302	1928562	What?
1928682	1935444	My Japanese side cries for books and stuff.
1935644	1935924	Okay.
1937324	1938345	I don't know.
1938785	1939505	I guess that's it.
1940445	1940866	All right.
1941666	1942587	Loki, how was your week?
1942607	1943088	How was your day?
1945750	1947252	My week was okay.
1948433	1953978	I played other games and worked on websites.
1956581	1957361	That's about it.
1958262	1959343	Ate steak today.
1961425	1961806	Steak.
1962046	1962646	What kind of steak?
1965629	1967010	How do you enjoy your slabs of meat?
1967030	1968231	Medium or medium rare.
1968311	1968531	Yeah.
1968871	1969091	Me too.
1969151	1969632	Anyways, so no, that
1989400	1991941	Pretty much all I did was play the Warriors this week.
1992761	1993741	And I love that game.
1994021	1997742	There's nothing more fun than a game that starts off with beating up bums.
1999323	2001043	And, you know, hitting them with bricks and stuff.
2001083	2005044	And then they mug somebody by throwing a TV at their head and knocking them down and then stole their money.
2005645	2007825	That's just, that's great gameplay right there.
2009406	2010046	So, yep.
2010566	2011146	That's what happened.
2012166	2014987	Okay, okay.
2015007	2016008	Um, well I guess that's it then.
2016128	2017008	Extrover, how was your week?
2017028	2017408	How was your day?
2018935	2019816	It was good.
2020436	2027482	I played a lot of World of Warcraft and I played some Final Fantasy XI.
2030965	2035569	My sister came over yesterday and hung out with me and you, Sky.
2036870	2043095	And we all hung out and stuff and ate at Claim Jumper, which is a popular restaurant over here.
2044896	2052582	Um, and today I kind of have, well, actually, you know, this week I've also been preparing for tomorrow's show.
2054823	2055424	Listen to it.
2055884	2056444	Starts tomorrow.
2057245	2057805	What's it called?
2057825	2058446	What time's it on?
2058486	2060367	Christopher's Case of the Monday starts at 7.
2062289	2063549	And, um... PST.
2064290	2065091	PST.
2065211	2067873	Meaning Pacific Standard Time, not Please Send Tell.
2067933	2069053	I know what it means.
2070434	2074878	So, you know, listen and stuff.
2075158	2077239	I'm planning on it lasting for two hours.
2077379	2078060	Who knows, though?
2078720	2079941	It may last less than that.
2081362	2084044	I'm just planning on it being kind of like a fun, random show.
2084384	2085085	Start off your week.
2086126	2087847	And I love my intro song.
2088868	2089508	Love it, love it.
2089548	2090589	I can't stop talking about it.
2090609	2091930	I'm almost obsessed with it.
2092470	2094031	So are you going to be sad if no one listens?
2096373	2097534	No, yes.
2097974	2098595	Well, possibly.
2099295	2102578	I figure either way, no matter what, it's got to have higher ratings than Diversion did.
2102798	2109063	So... Well, just listen, give it a chance, be objective.
2109463	2110544	It's not going to be all sex.
2111565	2112586	It'll be more than that.
2113726	2121292	Although I'd enjoy if you'd just take off your pants when you listen to it.
2121353	2123034	Your mic is going on and off.
2123754	2124635	That cord sucks.
2124675	2125596	We have to get it replaced, so...
2126331	2127232	Okay, well.
2127272	2127613	Are you there?
2128434	2128814	I think I am.
2128834	2129435	Yeah, I can hear you.
2129515	2129835	Barely.
2131157	2132578	Yeah, use Loki's mic for now.
2133019	2133419	Okay.
2134000	2134901	It's a little clearer anyway.
2136182	2138025	So anyways, that's how my week and my day was.
2138926	2139106	Okay.
2140633	2141334	My week and my day.
2141394	2145217	I went to a party last night and I got slightly intoxicated.
2146998	2147379	Slightly.
2148059	2148640	But I'm okay.
2149320	2151142	And remember kids, don't drink and drive.
2151362	2151642	I didn't.
2153644	2158147	And I've been playing a lot of World of Warcraft myself this week, which I know makes me a huge-ass hypocrite.
2159548	2159828	But no.
2160949	2162310	I don't go by books, okay?
2162350	2163290	I don't go by the manga.
2164030	2164850	I'm just kidding, I'm kidding.
2165171	2165491	It's cool.
2166631	2171673	But I've just been trying to get into it and seeing how I like it compared to the other MMOs out there.
2172253	2176574	And other than that, I haven't been doing a whole lot of things of interest.
2177775	2182556	I did watch the season premieres of South Park and Drawn Together, though, which were excellent.
2183657	2184597	We should have listened!
2185694	2186636	We should have listened!
2187298	2189483	Go around the ends and say trick or treat.
2189784	2191147	And you, like, get turned into stuff.
2191528	2192691	I know, I got turned into a ninja today.
2192872	2193914	I got turned into a bat.
2193974	2195037	That was kind of interesting.
2195717	2197157	I got turned into a skeleton.
2197518	2202939	Although I really think that the Halloween stuff in World of Warcraft is way better than Final Fantasy XI.
2203439	2205740	Like, I can't stand the Final Fantasy XI thing.
2206360	2206960	It just sucked.
2207380	2211882	I'm going to talk about this on the podcast a little later, but I don't want to compare Final Fantasy XI to World of Warcraft.
2211902	2212722	But you know what?
2212782	2215443	I can compare those two because they're both having Halloween events.
2216163	2216723	So, you know...
2220014	2221695	Yeah, that's fine.
2222455	2223876	All right, let's see.
2223916	2229820	I think what we'll do now is we're going to take a little bit of break, then we're going to come back and we're going to talk about some Bomani news, some things going on in the Bomani world.
2230260	2233662	So let's see, what do we want to do this break?
2234182	2240265	I think we'll do another Captain Jack song, although I think we'll keep it to shorter versions this time.
2241106	2244908	And we'll be back after this break with more Orange Lodge Radio.
2244948	2246289	Don't forget, you can call our message line.
2246309	2246629	We're going to
2247009	2249930	Get into the message line in probably about another 30 minutes or so.
2250010	2252472	So make sure you get all your messages in about Captain Jack.
2253392	2257834	Area code 916-226-9067.
2257874	2260135	Remember, it's a three-hour show, so keep your messages short.
2260455	2262536	We can't guarantee we'll get to all the messages as well.
2263276	2264597	So just give it a call.
2265437	2268659	And we'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.
2271152	2271732	Are you ready?
2271752	2273513	Ready for the race?
2273653	2274293	Are you ready?
2274513	2275894	Are you ready?
2276594	2277214	Are you ready?
2363391	2364374	My Generation

2447230	2448452	My Generation
2526005	2526585	Thanks for watching!
2553929	2555999	Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go
2637380	2639702	Go left, go right, go left, go left, go right, go left
2657179	2659561	We're back here on Orange Lounge Radio on this episode number 161.
2660042	2664986	A whole break there of Captain Jack songs from DDR because, of course, Captain Jack passed this past week.
2665707	2667608	So we're just kind of doing some tributes tonight.
2667728	2669890	Some songs there that you heard in that break, The Race.
2670011	2673153	That was a song that was in not only DDR third mix, but also a Beatmania song.
2673694	2674535	Kind of a fun song there.
2674855	2681401	My Generation, which I believe was the first Captain Jack song to be in American DDR, I think.
2682301	2684623	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2710958	2714762	And then, of course, Captain Jack, which is kind of the song that everybody knows.
2715242	2717043	The actual song, Captain Jack, from 3rd Mix.
2718184	2719265	The song that has the F word in it.
2719726	2720706	I will be your fucking man.
2721207	2721887	At one point in there.
2722268	2722608	Really?
2722628	2723028	That's right.
2723349	2724209	Lays down the smack there.
2724289	2725310	I will be your fucking man.
2727717	2729018	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2750033	2751194	and here's the catch.
2751854	2755537	Not only is it a copy of DDR Extreme 2, it's a bundle, kids.
2755637	2760881	It's a bundle pack, which means it has an official Konami soft pad bundled in with it.
2760941	2763062	And those things are not easy to get.
2763503	2766425	So if you want the best soft pad you can get,
2767065	2768747	We're going to give you a chance to win it next week.
2769007	2770649	And a copy of DDR Extreme 2 as well.
2770989	2772831	And more details to come next week.
2773171	2774233	I don't know what we're going to do.
2774353	2775894	We'll have to think about that.
2775934	2778277	We're going to boo about that over this next week.
2778377	2779398	So it'll be exciting.
2779418	2780099	So we're going to give that away.
2783129	2787172	Also, one more thing I want to point out is our message line.
2787212	2788513	We are taking messages right now.
2788573	2793316	If you have something you want to say about Captain Jack, area code 916-226-9067.
2793356	2796639	That's the brand new Orange Lounge Radio message line.
2797782	2798983	Thank you for watching!
2815370	2815910	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2836016	2836696	A podcast.
2836756	2840137	It's the new MIDI Head MP3 where he's teasing Ultramix 3.
2840457	2843438	And I'm going to be downright honest, I haven't had time to listen to it yet.
2843938	2844898	I listened to part of it.
2844918	2845178	Did you?
2845218	2845959	What did you think?
2845999	2847399	What came up?
2847559	2850440	It's just as cool as most MIDI Head stuff.
2850840	2853520	Played some more tracks from his new album.
2854361	2854521	And...
2856161	2856982	It's just, it was good.
2857243	2862128	And he gave, he let us know what some of the artists are going to be on Ultramix 3.
2862229	2864031	Looks like quite a lineup, too.
2864251	2866574	Yeah, it's got a very interesting lineup in Ultramix 3.
2866954	2867955	Let's see, I gotta head on over here to...
2870382	2878489	One of the websites here, because honestly, I've been a little bit disconnected from everything this week, so... I haven't really been reading what's going on.
2878809	2887256	I did hear, I heard some people bitching in the chatroom about Good Charlotte being in Ultramix 3, so I guess that news came out, that Good Charlotte's going to be in there.
2887276	2892701	Yeah, I know, that's kind of an interesting addition, to say the least.
2894202	2894322	Um...
2895103	2896664	Of course, They Might Be Giants.
2896684	2907211	I think some folks in the thread there used screen captures from a screenshot that was released on the internet to figure out that the They Might Be Giants song we were supposed to be getting is Istanbul, not Constantinople.
2907492	2910294	Which actually makes me sad because I wanted the Tiny Toons video in it.
2910734	2913396	Because that would have been awesome if it was the Tiny Toons music video.
2914289	2914929	Moby
2944218	2944999	Black Eyed Peas
2957779	2959600	B-52s, that's pretty awesome.
2959620	2960881	The B-52s are awesome.
2961601	2964602	I don't know which song it's going to be, but I'm... I hope they do Rome.
2965283	2968184	I liked Rome, but I'm kind of hoping for Rock Lobster a little bit.
2968584	2969345	Rock Lobster!
2969765	2972146	They always do Love Shack Rock Lobster.
2972646	2975248	It'll probably be Love Shack, but, you know.
2976288	2976808	What else is there?
2976828	2978029	Let's see, we've got Basement Jacks.
2978369	2978950	That's pretty cool.
2979270	2979850	Basement Jacks.
2980950	2981651	No FX.
2983001	2984563	Blackalicious, Groove Armada, and Devo
3000748	3003029	It's like Myspace in the form of DDR.
3026952	3027813	It totally is.
3028293	3028954	It totally is.
3029014	3031156	Ultramix 3 is DDR Myspace mix.
3033318	3033959	That's great.
3039624	3046070	I wonder if next year when they do Ultramix 4, if they're going to go up to the 360 or if they're going to stay on the regular Xbox platform.
3046090	3046831	What's going to happen?
3047171	3047832	Should be interesting.
3048660	3051605	Of course, we already know a bunch of other songs that are going to be in Ultra Mix 3 this year.
3052406	3058236	We have songs such as Spray doing I Am Gothic.
3058677	3060480	So that's kind of another borderline emo song.
3063171	3065033	They should have done the Kill With My Car song.
3066254	3080985	Raise Your Hands by Midihead, of course, Conflict by The Azoic, Basile by Orif Is, Drivin', Naoki featuring Politary, and Brilliant R.E.D., which is a brand new Naoki song, which one of the screenshots gave away that was posted by another website.
3081966	3086350	Love This Feelin', the Zonk remix by Akiriyama Oka, but remixed by Zonk.
3086810	3093614	JellyKiss, MidiHead, SmackMix HashTheSun, Shatonix Remix of Colors, MidiHead Remix of Bylalaki I Carried With The Wind Come With Me, Raindancer
3111724	3114828	and Together and Forever by Captain Jack, which I think is pretty cool.
3114888	3119173	So we do get a Captain Jack song in Ultramix 3, pretty appropriate at this point.
3119893	3121776	So that's what's going on with Ultramix 3.
3126793	3127813	should be an interesting mix.
3128434	3136220	Alright, I think what we'll do now, why don't we go ahead and let's go over to the Orange Launch Radio message line and let's see what we got on our messages.
3136320	3139422	And then we'll actually open up the Skype line in a little bit to take calls.
3139742	3148349	And when we open up the Skype line to take live calls, you can either call us over the Skype line like you always do in the past, or you can just get on the phone and punch in the digits.
3148709	3151131	So we're going to load up and see what messages we got on the Skype line.
3151351	3152652	We wanted to see what people had to say about...
3155273	3160977	and of course this is a brand new thing kind of for us is this whole thing so this is very experimental so I'm not sure
3162660	3163060	He's your webmaster.
3163080	3163681	I like it.
3192276	3193617	Whoops, I think that was a test call.
3195258	3197219	Let's try this one instead.
3198899	3199600	Yeah, what's up?
3199660	3200240	It's the same.
3200860	3205403	I mean, I don't know, this whole thing about Captain Jack is pretty crappy.
3206303	3207724	I mean, I love the songs.
3208144	3211046	Good times at Third Mix playing Captain Jack on the standard.
3211906	3217989	Oh, those were good times, but you know, it's terrible a guy like that has to mess away, so I don't know.
3219570	3221271	It just sucks, but
3222202	3223884	Captain Jack lives on in our hearts.
3225605	3231712	And did you also know Captain Jack, I was looking at pictures, he's a freaking pimp.
3232612	3234474	Captain Jack is the master pimp.
3234494	3237938	He had so many ladies, it was just awesome.
3238839	3242602	But, sucks about Captain Jack.
3248424	3251205	Captain Jack was all about the hot bitches, honestly.
3252266	3260890	You see these pictures, I mean, if you go to his official website, which I think is like CaptainJack.de or something like that, you go to his website, and in like half his picture galleries, he is surrounded by hot-ass bitches.
3261350	3264672	And, you know, what a fun guy.
3265092	3265952	Let's go to another message.
3266012	3267253	He was a pimp, but in a good way.
3268534	3271315	Hey, just sitting here in my room, Nintendo Maniac 64.
3271755	3276157	Just testing out this new golf thingy.
3277238	3277678	Can't answer...
3278655	3280335	I'm in the living room, I'm just back in my room.
3280355	3283236	Supposed to be doing homework, but... You know what?
3283256	3284416	Screw you, homework!
3284656	3285536	Screw you!
3286216	3286556	Yeah.
3287216	3288457	It really grinds like yours.
3289917	3291737	Like America does to Peter Griffin.
3293898	3296538	So... I think I'm getting Doritos and stuff.
3296798	3297418	Doritos are good.
3297618	3298418	Especially the ranch flavor.
3298438	3301859	I'm just watching movies that... Are you high?!
3303459	3304219	Is this guy high?!
3304239	3305400	No, I don't think so.
3306640	3307980	Yeah, I'm just, like, jabbering.
3309824	3312727	So yeah, Loki, I know what you did with my foot last night.
3312987	3315649	I don't know what the heck was going on in that sick mind of yours.
3316890	3323516	And go to gamersadvance.com because they have openings for, like, reviewer people and stuff.
3324017	3331083	Yeah, gamersadvance.com with a D at the end of advance.
3331523	3331783	Okay?
3333125	3333965	Spits.com.
3334166	3334846	Yeah, Spits.com.
3335987	3336708	I come out into the...
3337435	3338416	I think he was high.
3338516	3339517	He was something.
3339537	3342579	He was so high he forgot to mention Captain Jack.
3342599	3343099	No, it's fine.
3343180	3343920	I'm just teasing.
3363234	3364395	I do agree with the Doritos.
3364415	3365676	Doritos are the shit though.
3365716	3366457	Doritos are awesome.
3366477	3367858	Ranch Doritos are good, but you know what?
3368339	3369399	Nothing beats the original.
3369600	3371021	They're the cheesy.
3371341	3372942	Well, the cheesiest is Cheetos, right?
3373663	3374103	I think so.
3374684	3377226	They're the cheesiest to me in my book.
3377806	3379507	Our listeners are kind of sedated tonight.
3379547	3380448	I don't know what's going on.
3380648	3381469	No, what's going on?
3381549	3381909	I don't know.
3381929	3384812	Did you guys put on a fire or something?
3385232	3387774	Shut all the windows or something?
3389275	3390156	Let's go to another message.
3391667	3393308	Greetings, Orange Lounge Radio.
3393368	3396830	This is El Mullet with my thoughts on the passing of Captain Jack.
3398171	3399812	I really like Captain Jack's music.
3399872	3406916	I've played it ever since the second remix home version when two of his songs were used as preview tracks.
3407936	3409998	And I remember Captain Jack fondly.
3410838	3412439	He had some of my favorite songs.
3412919	3420964	And I remember him especially fondly because Captain Jack's Grand Ballet mix was the first catastrophic level song that I have ever passed.
3421601	3426924	which is really odd considering his step chart is incredibly difficult to begin with.
3427444	3429485	Yeah, it is.
3429766	3435789	And also, Dream of Dream was the first heavy song at seven stars that I ever AAA'd.
3436950	3442953	In any case, Captain Jack was very fun not only to listen to but to look at through his music videos.
3443573	3446555	If you wanted to know where all the white women were at, there they were.
3447896	3449777	And in any case, I will remember him
3450700	3457404	with the greatest of memories, as it were, for lack of better words, and embarrassing myself on your new message line.
3458885	3460025	It's okay, everybody else is.
3460385	3468310	I shall be playing his songs in remembrance, and thank you for allowing me this forum to talk about Captain Jack.
3468810	3470531	Thank you very much, everyone, and goodbye.
3470551	3474693	Where are the white women going to hang out now?
3475214	3477615	Now that Captain Jack's gone, where are all the white women going to go?
3478468	3480249	They'll go hang out with another gangsta.
3480609	3482089	I don't know, I don't know.
3482209	3482809	In Germany.
3484890	3485770	Good message, I like that.
3486871	3487691	Wasn't he from Germany?
3488551	3493533	No, I don't think he was from Germany, but he was big in Germany, like Hasselhoff was big in Germany.
3495613	3502736	Baywatch.de Let's go to another message here on the Orange Lounge Radio message line, then we're going to open it up for live calls very soon.
3504336	3506757	Hi, Orange Lounge People, this is Goggles Chatroom.
3509295	3517022	Dream of Dream was one of the first songs I played in DDR, and I guess it always held a special place in my heart.
3518583	3526029	Oh, and then I hung up.
3526990	3529712	No, Dream of Dream is one of the awesome DDR songs.
3529772	3533515	We've got to play that at some point tonight, because Dream of Dream, that's one of my favorite DDR songs as well.
3534448	3546692	Didn't I play that, like, when I first came up here and on, like, episode 37 or something and we went to, like, Stockton and, like, they had, like, a fourth mix there or something and I played it there?
3548390	3577283	possibly, Dream of Dreams debut was on 4th Mix and it's got a really, you know, the riff is from Hall of the Mountain King which is, you know, one of the, you know, like classic songs I do seem to recall that we went out and played like 4th or 5th Mix and probably that song came up because it's an easy as hell 7 footer but when I say easy, I mean fun like it was like a very constant, you know, the steps and a lot of people have fun with it if you're going to AAA heavy songs, Dream of Dreams is a good one to start off with
3578803	3579624	What are you talking about?
3579664	3581705	I still can't follow Heavy Arrows anyway.
3583127	3584688	Well, you know, it's a good song to warm up to.
3584708	3585669	It's a good song to warm up to.
3585689	3587610	All right, we got one more message on the message line.
3587630	3588091	Let's go to it.
3590192	3591473	Hi, this is Illusion.
3591613	3593615	Everybody, you know, what do you like?
3594496	3604884	When I found out Captain Jack died, I was surprised, but I didn't think it would affect DVR much because we got all his recordings out of the way.
3605905	3608227	But, yeah, I was surprised and
3609787	3615473	It was a sad thing to hear, and I hope his family's doing just fine now.
3617175	3622520	Yeah, of course, Captain Jack, his family, gotta be taking this harder than anybody in the scene is.
3624542	3628046	Obviously, our thoughts go out to Captain Jack's family and the surviving relatives.
3630239	3631640	How many times was Captain Jack married?
3631920	3632341	Only once?
3632501	3633902	I'm not sure.
3634122	3638686	I think the lead singer of Captain Jack at one point was his wife.
3639006	3642249	There were like four different women in Captain Jack at one point.
3642509	3645872	I think the first one was his wife at some point.
3647634	3648715	You think they were all his wives?
3649836	3650176	No.
3651317	3651677	Never mind.
3652698	3654219	He was in more women than they were in...
3660906	3661446	Oh, shit.
3661526	3664428	All right, on that note, let's go skypline.
3664448	3667870	We'll take your calls on anything, anything you want to talk about within reason, kids.
3667930	3674133	You can either call us the old-fashioned way by loading up the skypline, or you can give us a call on the telephone.
3674213	3680556	Of course, our brand-new telephone number that you can give us a call on, it is area code 916-226-9067.
3682838	3684418	Either way you want to do it there.
3684458	3688220	But, of course, kids, ask your parents' permission before calling because it might be a toll charge.
3690287	3690507	Sephiroth 1215
3706171	3708774	First of all, yeah, sadly Captain Jack died.
3708834	3717001	I actually had friends over when the news came up and they really even played EDR and even they were kind of awing.
3717722	3720024	Because they recognized the pimpness of Captain Jack.
3720424	3723227	Surely that guy had a ton of medals.
3724793	3725453	for a reason.
3726053	3726374	Yeah.
3727274	3727514	Anyway.
3728494	3732455	I mean, hopefully, I'm sure they would do something in Ultramix 3, but I don't even know.
3732475	3735576	I don't think there's enough time for them to even put a little tribute in there.
3735817	3743259	It would be nice for them to say something like in the manual or something, but seeing as the game is probably already on its way to the
3743679	3758292	Pressing Mill before this news came out I wouldn't expect to see anything in Ultramix 3 regarding this maybe this time next year when the new DDR games come out assuming we're getting more DDR games next year but I don't see how we couldn't possibly be maybe we'll see something in Beatmania
3758712	3779766	although I don't know about that and the only way I guess maybe we'd get that is if the race showed up as one of the five key songs but you never know what might happen over at Konami so we'll see now we might see something in DDR Strike the Japanese DDR because that still isn't going to be coming out until early 2006 as far as we know so they have plenty of time to do something for Captain Jack if they want over there so we'll see
3781334	3803512	Yeah, yeah, hopefully they will, but on the same note, I mean, I got to play the demo of Ultramix 3, which, I mean, it, the demo actually was kind of broken, well, maybe it was just the disc, but it froze up a lot for me, but otherwise it played just the same as Ultramix 2, except for the bubbles, and that's it.
3803852	3810234	You know, from what I remember at E3, the game did play just like Ultramix 2 with maybe some minor differences, so I don't know.
3810274	3815815	But then again, Ultramix 2 is one of the better Bomani games they put out ever at the home, so if it ain't broke, don't fix it, right?
3817216	3818596	Oh yeah, yeah, I'm sure it'll be fine.
3818656	3820016	It was just a demo disc I got.
3820156	3821757	Yeah.
3821817	3829839	Otherwise, I saw an ad for it, and I believe it even said in the chatroom that
3830925	3833547	Run DMC is going to be in there with Walk This Way.
3834548	3834949	Really?
3835750	3835930	Yeah.
3835950	3836871	Where did we hear that?
3837071	3838372	Was that on the podcast or something?
3838652	3839253	I might have missed it.
3841235	3847080	No, it was just in the chat room before and they have it advertised in an ad in a magazine.
3847841	3849042	They just have the background for it.
3849162	3849482	Wow.
3849622	3855688	It was based on like they saw there's a screenshot of a movie which looks like, you know, from the video.
3856343	3857023	Interesting.
3857043	3863806	Well, that would be a very interesting... I mean, obviously this is looking like one of the more diverse mixes we've gotten, so something like that wouldn't surprise me at all.
3863866	3869007	Well, MidiHead said that 80% of the music that was going to be in Ultramix 3 is going to be new to DDR.
3869147	3869347	Good!
3870468	3870628	Good.
3870908	3871288	Good news.
3872488	3874869	If you want the Japanese crossovers, go play Extreme 2.
3875169	3876630	Or go buy a Japanese PlayStation.
3880771	3882072	Also, the ad said that...
3883268	3887312	There's a new website called musicineverydirection.com.
3887972	3889674	I went today, but it's not even up yet.
3890875	3893117	And it also says coming soon to mobile.
3893958	3894679	What, DDR?
3895499	3895820	Yeah.
3896280	3897021	That's kind of weird.
3898635	3900836	Okay, well, it wouldn't surprise me, I guess.
3900876	3904579	I mean, they had Pump It Up on mobile overseas, so... And you know what?
3904619	3909181	Yeah, Konami's been doing the mobile thing, because I downloaded Castlevania on the mobile phone, which, by the way, sucked.
3910022	3919548	But it was there, and it was on the mobile phone, so it wouldn't surprise me if DDR shows up on mobile, but I don't really get the point, because you can't dance, but whatever.
3921638	3923238	Yeah, whatever, I guess.
3923678	3924038	You're right.
3925599	3933480	Otherwise, the demo also has a demo of Castlevania, but I got really pissed off because that's the one demo that absolutely would not work on there.
3933680	3934020	Really?
3934861	3935361	Yeah.
3935581	3938141	Oh, I want to check out the Castlevania demo, though, but it doesn't work?
3938181	3940282	How did that get by QA?
3941822	3945483	It says that it's unable to read disk every time I try and do it.
3946443	3947223	Very interesting.
3947243	3947463	Interesting.
3947912	3949412	Those merits coming out in two weeks anyways.
3950093	3951853	Yeah, but we want to play a free demo.
3953014	3953494	Whatever.
3954674	3955734	Free stuff rocks.
3956074	3956495	I know.
3957635	3967358	Speaking of free stuff, Toys R Us now has a deal going on this week where you can buy two Xbox, PS2, or GameCube games and you get one free.
3967598	3967998	Any of them.
3968838	3969158	Awesome.
3969279	3970079	Buy two, get one free?
3971039	3971719	Yeah.
3971779	3974480	Oh, man, I just bought two games at Toys R Us last week.
3975501	3976121	Bastards.
3976161	3977801	They always do that shit after I shop there.
3977841	3978081	Oh, well.
3978702	3979282	That's cool, though.
3979362	3980442	Hey, I'm going to have to go check that out.
3980462	3985084	I imagine they're probably trying to clear the shelves to make way for an Xbox 360 setup, but we'll see.
3986464	3986845	Maybe.
3988685	3990526	Otherwise, I guess that's it for me.
3990786	3991026	Okay.
3991286	3991706	Sounds good.
3991766	3994047	Thanks for the call, and take care, Sephiroth, okay?
3994707	3995487	Okay, you too.
3995507	3995768	Later.
3997228	3997928	Let's go to another call.
3998909	3999689	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4002748	4002948	Hello?
4003368	4003648	Hello?
4004128	4004308	Yes.
4004328	4004748	Hello.
4004948	4005349	Hello.
4006589	4007569	It's Nintendo Maniac 64.
4008549	4010390	How you doing, Nintendo Maniac 64?
4011350	4012730	By the way, I was not high.
4013130	4014851	I knew that was you that had called in earlier.
4016511	4024993	You tell me, though, how we're supposed to not think you're high, because, you know, you got the Dorito Craven going on, and you kind of had that voice on your message like, Hey, guys.
4028268	4030350	The phone, excuse me, it's not exactly the loudest thing.
4031071	4032793	I know, it's a cheap phone.
4033213	4034935	I think we have like five bucks on that.
4035236	4035576	What is that?
4035736	4038760	There's some noise in the background there that sounds like Christopher's car.
4039140	4039581	Like this is...
4042444	4044085	This is probably my laptop's fan.
4044325	4054170	Oh, okay, because the belt on Christopher's car is like about to fall off or something, so every time he starts his car, like if we had a microphone cord that we could run outside, we probably wouldn't even need to get it outside, we'd just get it to the door.
4054291	4058113	Seriously, every single time I start the car, everybody thinks there's a fire going on somewhere.
4058293	4067398	I know when Christopher leaves for work in the morning, because like he'll turn on his car and then, like you hear this really loud belt noise that I'm sure wakes up all the neighbors.
4067438	4068718	I need to announce when I leave.
4070119	4071660	X the fun has left the building.
4072629	4073510	Excuse me.
4074391	4074711	Alright.
4075632	4080638	There is a song that actually has, like, pardon me, like, let's wake up the neighbors or something.
4081559	4083100	I usually play that when you're playing.
4083861	4090008	I just, you know, between you and me, we kind of live in the ghetto as it is, so I don't want to have music wars around here because we will lose.
4093825	4094566	What else is on your mind?
4095127	4095627	Doritos.
4095667	4097369	Doritos coming out tomorrow.
4098030	4098691	What's coming out tomorrow?
4099291	4100313	Mario Mix, DDR.
4100653	4102095	Oh, yeah, DDR Mario Mix.
4102115	4103857	Oh, hell, the DDR I forgot all about.
4104337	4107741	Yeah, DDR Mario Mix is coming out tomorrow, and that's about all I have to say.
4108262	4111566	No, maybe I'll check it out, but at the same time,
4114543	4118444	It's easy, and it's chibi, and I don't know.
4119184	4121725	I'm not looking forward to paying $60 for it.
4122425	4122925	You know what I mean?
4123665	4124265	Yeah, I know.
4124625	4127426	Well, I only have a GameCube because I'm not rich and stuff.
4128746	4130046	I can't afford many consoles.
4130786	4133587	Neither am I, but I sell drugs.
4133867	4134707	No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
4134727	4136828	Yeah, and I sell Doritos.
4139511	4144194	No, I have a day job where I make decent money.
4144714	4145655	Selling drugs to kids.
4145735	4146936	No, I do not sell drugs to kids.
4146976	4147836	He sells drugs to kids.
4147856	4149037	I do not sell drugs to kids.
4149357	4150518	You might as well just get it out.
4150558	4152479	I sell drugs to nuns, not kids.
4153279	4153539	Nuns?
4154500	4155941	Kids that are in training to be nuns.
4160739	4171005	No, I have a day job, and since we live in the ghetto, my rent isn't very expensive, so I have leftover money to spend on things like Bomani Games and, you know, systems and drugs.
4173126	4173526	I'm kidding!
4174447	4176128	Drugs are for losers.
4176788	4177629	Unless you want some weed.
4177649	4178169	Except for Vicodin.
4178189	4178870	Vicodin is for winners.
4185011	4186232	There's a lot of losers in high school.
4186472	4191396	What was that big FBI message that used to show up at the beginning of all the Capcom games like Final Fight and stuff?
4191656	4193657	Winners don't use drugs for the big FBI.
4193717	4195318	And it's like, dude, this is a video game.
4195358	4196619	Why are we... I don't know.
4197660	4199081	It's like community service.
4199201	4199742	What the heck?
4200442	4201423	Sorry, I'm being random.
4202204	4203385	Yeah, much like you.
4206408	4209511	Any other thoughts, Mr. Nintendomaniac64, before we go to another call?
4210212	4213015	I think my parents are right next door, like, making love to each other.
4213635	4213936	What?!
4215858	4216438	I'm serious.
4216538	4217759	I can tell you stories.
4218140	4219161	Wait, wait, wait.
4219181	4221123	Did he say the parents are next door?
4221683	4222744	Making love to each other.
4223405	4226588	My parents are, like, right next door to my room.
4227148	4227288	Uh-huh.
4228989	4230030	Are you hearing things?
4231131	4232052	Uh, not much.
4232272	4233373	It's very mumbled.
4234073	4234774	And, like, muffled.
4234854	4237236	Would we be able to hear it if you put the phone next to the wall?
4237996	4238577	No, you wouldn't.
4240270	4241451	You make for bad radio.
4241471	4244834	Do you have any pictures on the wall that are kind of, like, vibrating?
4244854	4247256	That's what used to happen to me.
4247276	4248097	Dude, it's his parent.
4248177	4248897	Oh, my God.
4248977	4252280	You've heard your... You know, I have stories.
4253761	4254082	Oh, wow.
4255329	4256390	I do have stories, though.
4257211	4260093	Look, Captain Jack would have wanted us to talk about the bitches, alright?
4261374	4262895	Sorry, Captain Jack, I didn't say anything.
4264476	4266438	Alright, now we definitely gotta let you go.
4266478	4267979	The chat room is about to have an aneurysm, okay?
4268660	4270401	Alright, have a good one.
4271242	4272022	Okay, bye.
4273343	4274244	Let's go to another call.
4275025	4276025	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4277126	4277527	Really?
4278147	4278387	Yes.
4280249	4281610	It is I, E.T.
4282571	4282731	Who?
4284414	4284754	Dark.
4285655	4286415	Oh, hey, what's up?
4286455	4286975	What's on your mind?
4286995	4289937	I don't know, I just thought I'd call.
4290997	4293899	It's the one and only Dark Tetsuya from our chatroom, boys and girls.
4294119	4294739	Yo, yo.
4294879	4296080	Hey, how's it going?
4296200	4297121	Good, what's on your mind?
4298421	4301143	I don't know, I just thought I'd call in.
4302503	4306766	Yeah, you're utilizing our new phone line, I can see, from the caller ID, so.
4307226	4309507	Yeah, I, yeah.
4310225	4310585	Awesome.
4310705	4311786	You have a caller ID on that?
4311826	4312747	Yeah, we have a caller ID on here.
4312767	4315028	So if we get crank callers, we know who you are.
4315048	4316309	We can stop 69 your ass.
4316629	4317830	We're going to stop 69 your ass.
4318110	4318930	Well, what's on your mind?
4320451	4322212	What was your reaction to the news about Captain Jack?
4323433	4326575	Yeah, that was a total surprise.
4327795	4329617	Yeah, it was very sudden because he was so young, obviously.
4330377	4330797	Oh, yeah.
4332178	4334019	No, my brother was a big fan of his.
4335640	4336921	Is your brother much of a DDR player?
4338422	4338862	Yeah, he is.
4343271	4343991	Okay, very cool.
4346092	4352575	So, yeah, it was kind of a bummer, because it was very sudden and everything, and he kind of died young, which is really too bad.
4352655	4353135	Yeah, I know.
4354296	4355156	It sucks, X-Fur.
4355176	4355816	It really sucks.
4356257	4358458	And some people are really hurting, X-Fur.
4360378	4360839	Bastard.
4361239	4363340	Anyway, what else is on your mind, DT?
4368784	4371586	Any cool games you've been playing this week you want to tell us about?
4371606	4372687	Just Extreme 2.
4373348	4374509	Extreme 2, how's that going?
4374529	4375609	Have you unlocked all the songs yet?
4376830	4378552	Oh no, I had to start over.
4378592	4380793	I tripped over the power cord.
4381994	4383856	Oh shit, you tripped over the power cord?
4384396	4387058	Yeah.
4387458	4388919	Oh no, that's the worst.
4388999	4390781	Like when the game was saving or something?
4391221	4393403	Yeah, when it was booting up.
4395042	4404947	I'm always afraid that that's going to happen to me, like when it says do not pull out the memory card, especially on those games that take forever to save to the memory card because the files are so huge, like a game like Cold Step or something.
4407128	4411550	When the file's saving, I'm afraid that Thunder's going to hit and then turn off my PlayStation 2.
4411650	4414331	That would be God's little joke on me, honestly.
4414692	4415952	Hehehe, I erased your file.
4416813	4417833	Hehehe, 27 hours on the game.
4417873	4419814	Hehehe, you're going to hell.
4421195	4423676	Alright, any other thoughts for us, DT, before we get on to another call?
4425615	4426636	No, that's about it.
4426716	4431278	I did unlock Section D on the Dance Master mode.
4431859	4432299	Which song?
4433360	4434661	So that's been kicking my ass.
4434941	4435221	Okay.
4437222	4438363	So that's pretty much it.
4438883	4439263	Alrighty.
4439483	4440404	Thank you for calling.
4440424	4441425	Well, thanks for calling.
4441505	4441925	Oh, yeah.
4442125	4442385	Alright.
4442906	4443566	Have a good one.
4443806	4444086	Later.
4446147	4449009	Our Skype line is screaming popular tonight.
4449510	4450330	Let's go to another call.
4450870	4451811	Hello, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.
4453072	4453913	Hey, this is Dark Knight.
4454033	4455013	Hey, Dark Knight, what's up?
4455594	4456334	Yo, yo, yo.
4457395	4457855	Hey, DJ.
4457876	4459477	Hey, what's up?
4460658	4467042	I thought I'd just pass along this for you about what I heard about Yahoo maybe trying a little DDR themselves.
4467743	4469364	Yahoo is getting into DDR?
4471013	4480319	Yeah, apparently they put out like a little game from Wild Tangent or something like that called Dance on Mag or Dance Groove or something like that.
4480359	4480619	Aw, fuck.
4480679	4485281	Isn't Wild Tangent... Loki, wasn't Wild Tangent the one that did Tappa Jam?
4485642	4486942	Or am I confusing that with somebody else?
4487143	4490344	You remember that Tappa Jam, the one that was like Beatmania but it was all like classical songs?
4490364	4491145	Yeah, I think that was.
4491165	4491565	Was that them?
4491905	4493006	Wild Tangent does something.
4493066	4496228	I think Wild Tangent actually... No, Wild Tangent does the shitty AOL games.
4497569	4504153	I thought they were just, it was just like some sort of, um, like a script package or something like that.
4504233	4507255	Devil work, that's what it is, devil, devil stuff.
4508036	4508236	No.
4509116	4511918	Anyway, I took a look at this game and everything, right?
4512599	4518602	Well, they do, like, Buster Groove, but they also have, like, a little DDR mode as well mixed into it.
4520123	4523946	So it's, oh, wait, I think I've played, you know what, I think I've played a game like this before.
4524366	4527568	Yeah, I think I pointed it out like a long time ago on AIM.
4527729	4530671	But I didn't, it wasn't a Yahoo game, it was an AIM game.
4530691	4535034	No, yeah, it was an AIM game, but maybe they're like Licensing it out to Yahoo.
4535094	4535715	Yeah, exactly.
4535735	4539157	Maybe, okay, because that would make sense because if Wild Tangent did the AOL games Right.
4539858	4543440	Okay, okay, so this game is about to get a little bit bigger it looks like.
4543560	4544081	Oh, brother.
4544201	4545101	Oh, goody, goody, goody.
4545182	4545662	Yay.
4547243	4548424	It looked weird, I was like
4549342	4550683	Wait, man, this is like Busted Groove.
4550963	4552684	Wait, man, this is like DDR.
4553325	4556607	I suppose imitation is the finest form of flattery?
4557347	4557908	Very much.
4558808	4563971	I mean, with the gallon there, the only problem is that if you have a slow computer, of course, the timing will be atrocious.
4564632	4565172	Oh, yeah.
4565652	4570595	I remember, I seem to recall that, was that it was a very slow game.
4570635	4572717	Like, even on my computer, which is kind of, you know, it's nice.
4572797	4574058	It was kind of a slow-running game.
4574458	4576319	Not a very optimized game, so...
4576579	4586945	Yeah, but here's another weird story about how McDonald's might be, McDonald's will let Nintendo DS owners play the Wi-Fi servers.
4587406	4589507	I heard about this, the Wi-Fi at McDonald's.
4589607	4593870	I mean, when I think about, here, let me think about places I want to go play my DS.
4593950	4595431	I don't think, oh, McD's.
4598072	4605537	McDonald's was cool for social gatherings when I was six years old and some kid would have their birthday party there because their parents were poor.
4605973	4608434	and couldn't afford anything but a McDonald's birthday party.
4608755	4609315	Exactly.
4610416	4617840	It's funny though, I was like, you get beat in there, and I was like, yeah, I would like a Big Mac, an order of fries, and a Wi-Fi connection.
4619701	4621282	Would you like to supersize your Wi-Fi?
4622122	4622703	Yes, I would.
4623772	4625333	Wow, that's going to be interesting.
4625393	4627934	So McDonald's is going to become the DS hotspot.
4628214	4629894	I believe I read that on Slashdot.
4630334	4632295	Yeah, I read that somewhere on the internet this week.
4632375	4633096	It's interesting.
4634136	4636377	I mean, it's weird how they send this all up.
4636437	4641239	It's like Nintendo DS Wi-Fi, open up to everybody in the U.S.
4641459	4642339	How about McDonald's now?
4643139	4649302	You know, I seem to remember, though, didn't McDonald's also at one point have Nintendo 64s in a lot of their stores for kids to play?
4649682	4652143	It was like a little toy, I guess it was.
4653223	4656745	So Nintendo and McDonald's are kind of teaming up a little bit here, I see.
4657005	4665088	I was going to say that, like, the, what do you call it, the Ronald House thing that I'm trying to, for like sick kids and stuff.
4665148	4665508	Oh, okay.
4665528	4666589	They actually did that.
4666649	4672531	They built the cabinet for, you know, it had like a TV and a Nintendo 64 and stuff, so you're right.
4674272	4678654	But one time, somebody said Burger King had a DDR machine or something like that.
4680184	4680524	You know what?
4680564	4681305	Nothing surprises me.
4681385	4682885	Franchise owners can get away with a lot.
4683206	4683866	Yeah.
4683886	4685407	I'm thinking McDonald's might get it first.
4685447	4688028	They did do like a little commercial with it.
4688088	4688908	We'll see what happens.
4688928	4689469	It'll be interesting.
4689749	4691710	I'm curious to see what happens with the Nintendo Wi-Fi.
4691930	4696372	Because, you know, McDonald's has tried to do the social gathering thing before, but more at a kid-oriented audience.
4696392	4700794	But it's things like, okay, remember when they released those 101 Dalmatian toys in the Happy Meals?
4700994	4701274	Yes.
4701414	4701694	Yeah.
4701815	4704436	And they would have like Tuesday trade night or whatever.
4704876	4706177	And sure, it was a bunch of little kids.
4706437	4708698	But do you know who was really trading that stuff?
4710293	4713415	Their parents were trading those 101 Dalmatians.
4713455	4714136	It wasn't the kids.
4714156	4715057	It was the damn parents.
4715077	4716638	Beanie Babies.
4716738	4717558	Beanie Babies.
4717638	4718759	McDonald's Beanie Babies.
4718899	4719539	Good God.
4719900	4721060	I used to work at McDonald's.
4721080	4722301	You used to work at McDonald's during that time, right?
4722321	4724142	I have all of the Beanie Babies in my room.
4724303	4724703	All of them.
4725183	4727725	Who would show up more at those Beanie Baby exchange nights?
4727765	4728645	Kids or their parents?
4728825	4729266	Soccer moms.
4729286	4731027	Soccer moms.
4733587	4733907	Awesome.
4734048	4736430	Anyway, that's all the news I got for you tonight.
4736530	4741995	I should have some more in the coming weeks, but right now those are like the two major ones that are coming up.
4742015	4746479	Hey, we appreciate you contributing positively to the show, unlike Extifer.
4747540	4750543	Bye, DK.
4751564	4752024	You too.
4752045	4753226	All right, bye, Dark Knight.
4753246	4753786	Have a good one.
4754106	4754647	All right.
4756369	4757430	Sorry, Extifer.
4757970	4758651	Kisses.
4761482	4762203	TOTAL SILENCE
4775805	4785672	Well, I felt kind of sad when I discovered Captain Jack was dead, because the first time I played his song was Captain Jack 3rd Mix Grandale.
4786953	4788394	A lot of people's first songs.
4790355	4792457	A lot of people's first Captain Jack song, definitely.
4793437	4801263	Yeah, and I just really liked the song, and I liked it even better when I heard the full version, because I just thought it was awesome.
4801983	4805446	And I was just wondering, could you please get Captain Jack Little Boy on there?
4806070	4808851	We will work in Captain Jack Little Boy on our next break.
4808911	4809311	Absolutely.
4810271	4810492	Bye.
4810952	4813473	All right.
4813693	4815513	That was a pretty quick request there.
4816414	4816994	Play Little Boy.
4817054	4817274	Click.
4819215	4819875	We're fine.
4819935	4822736	Even if you're going to hang up and ditch, maybe I won't play it.
4822956	4824096	He just called ditched us.
4824456	4825957	He totally just called ditched us.
4826017	4826477	That's all right.
4827898	4829098	I know the Skype thing's new.
4831879	4834400	I'm surprised we don't get crank calls more on this program.
4836067	4836827	Don't say that!
4836867	4838548	People are actually going to do it now.
4839088	4841709	I scared them already because I told them we have ways of finding out who they are.
4841929	4846710	Hey, if you want to listen to my show tomorrow, you can call Ditch Me.
4847150	4847450	It's cool.
4847510	4849571	Alright, let's go to another call.
4849931	4851231	Let's go to another call.
4851351	4853772	Hi, you're on Orange House Radio.
4854092	4854432	Hey.
4854452	4854492	Hi.
4855432	4856812	Is it actually working this time?
4856872	4857953	It is actually working.
4858013	4859253	I hear you loud and clear.
4859533	4860873	Who is this?
4861133	4861854	This is Roz.
4861994	4862514	Hi, Roz.
4862534	4863054	What's on your mind?
4864740	4866501	Um, not too much.
4868183	4871805	I just got home from a fun experience.
4872806	4874487	Ooh, fun experience, huh?
4874807	4875647	Tell us more about it.
4876528	4885494	Yeah, I sat in church for an hour watching the bishop of the diocese say the rosary and sitting next to an old lady who wouldn't stop clearing her throat.
4886240	4888402	You have a very strange definition of fun experience.
4890243	4890724	I just wanted to say.
4890744	4892085	It was annoying as shit.
4892305	4892905	Okay, there you go.
4892925	4893286	Thank you.
4895047	4895808	Don't lie to us.
4895908	4896488	Don't lie to us.
4896568	4898490	That was not a fun experience.
4898510	4902833	That was a, I think I want to crawl under the pew experience.
4902913	4904094	Yeah, yeah.
4904214	4907537	Afterwards, I ran into the house and took a shower.
4907557	4909339	So, I'm good.
4913141	4915942	Loki's sitting in the back there, by the way, going, now we're talking.
4916282	4916943	Pervert.
4918823	4919164	Oh, yeah.
4919304	4919984	Fantasize.
4920344	4921364	All right.
4921925	4922685	I encourage it.
4923005	4927527	Now I wonder why I associate with these guys.
4927967	4928387	Never mind.
4928427	4929227	Oh, come on.
4929247	4930228	You know you like it.
4930288	4933269	To our credit, two of us are gay, you know.
4934318	4935679	It's okay, I can hang out with the women.
4936701	4937061	It's cool.
4937722	4938262	I like women.
4938703	4939704	I like women too.
4939724	4940945	They're fun to shop with, anyway.
4941185	4942226	And play around with.
4943267	4944629	Play around meaning shop with.
4944649	4946451	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
4946551	4946971	God.
4947572	4948653	Oh, now he changed it.
4948753	4951456	Anyway, let's let our caller talk a little more there.
4951796	4952537	Hello, caller.
4952557	4956381	I'm hitting the chat, and like, everyone seems horribly surprised that I'm a girl.
4957621	4971153	You know what, for some reason it's like this big thing like OMG a gamer girl Although like, I thought that was like years old now There's plenty of gamer girls out there now Actually, when I first walked into that chat room Are you a guy?
4971673	4981222	Uh, no Wow, no, there's plenty of girls that play video games of all types now And you have a super sounding voice too
4983613	4984734	I just thought I would say that.
4984794	4986215	Geez, don't look at me like that, Skye.
4986475	4987516	I'm just saying.
4987536	4990198	I'm like, okay, if you want to pay the callers a compliment, not a problem.
4990238	4998324	It sounds like you would be a good addition to listening to my show starting tomorrow at 7 o'clock PST.
4999144	4999965	He ain't too proud to beg.
5001606	5006349	Yeah, I'm all up in the East Coast, so, you know.
5007050	5008291	So, like, 10 o'clock?
5008331	5010032	She's got to go to bed by the time your show comes on.
5010592	5012454	What do you have going on in the morning on Tuesday?
5012494	5012794	You know what?
5013732	5015473	Stop berating the listeners, Extover.
5015853	5016193	Stop it.
5016954	5018335	We need to talk serious here for a minute.
5018355	5020716	It's after primetime program.
5020776	5022037	Extover, I will take your mic away.
5023498	5025479	Ross, I need to know your thoughts on Captain Jack.
5026700	5035805	You know, I had no idea until after I got home from the church and being coughed on by that old lady.
5036745	5042849	I came back, I checked the site, and I was like, holy shit, because I had no idea.
5044172	5044873	I don't know what else to say.
5064921	5066362	Okay, Roz, well, thanks for the call.
5066602	5070084	And we're going to let you go so we can get to some more calls because our line is lighting up tonight.
5070144	5071625	But thanks for calling.
5072185	5072746	And have a good one.
5072766	5074106	Yeah, I'm glad it worked this time.
5074366	5074767	Absolutely.
5074787	5075387	I'm glad, too.
5075547	5076067	I'm glad to hear it.
5076828	5077648	All right, take care, Roz.
5078389	5078609	Bye.
5078749	5079189	Bye-bye.
5080710	5081450	Let's go to another call.
5082311	5082891	One more, at least.
5083211	5083992	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
5085563	5088245	Hey, this is GS191 in the chat rooms.
5088585	5090746	Hello, GS191 in the chat rooms.
5090806	5091126	What's up?
5092327	5092767	Not much.
5093188	5096350	I just heard about Captain Jack just now.
5097030	5098851	So I'm very, very shocked.
5098931	5101292	Amazing that people actually get their news from our show.
5101593	5104454	I always thought that we were the redundancy of the Internet.
5104474	5106916	But no, that's interesting.
5106976	5109297	But yeah, I'm sorry you had to find out through our show.
5111078	5112259	But what do you think?
5112319	5113380	I mean, it's kind of sudden, huh?
5114440	5119263	Yeah, I remember back in the really, really old days of, like, the third mix, Korean version 2.
5119463	5120823	Oh, yes.
5121063	5121424	Oh, yes.
5122684	5125346	I did not... Shit.
5127167	5128107	Yeah, you could tell it was the first time.
5128147	5128507	It's all right.
5129028	5129548	You know what?
5129808	5130848	It's just internet radio.
5130929	5132890	No one expects anything, so... Yeah.
5132930	5133650	It's all good, man.
5134030	5137052	Look, if we can get a show, anything can happen.
5137072	5137452	If I can get a show?
5137532	5141574	Yeah, if Extaper can get a show, anything goes on the internet, so feel free.
5141594	5142174	Say anything.
5142194	5142534	Just relax.
5142635	5142795	Anything.
5142855	5143255	Anything.
5145745	5150970	I remember playing the Ray song on the third mix, and that was my first Captain Jack song, and I loved it.
5152892	5161520	When I got home, I frantically tried to search for the long version, found it, and put it on repeat on my CD player for a long, long time.
5162481	5165103	That's what a lot of people do with DDR music when they first play the game.
5165983	5169266	You know, you can see the life of a DDR noob.
5169627	5178314	It's like they play the game, then they find that song they like, then they burn their first DDR CD and they listen to it over and over and over again in the car, and then they're playing it to all their friends.
5178414	5180856	Like, listen to this really cheesy DDR music.
5181176	5181957	That was me, anyway.
5182657	5184699	As Angel turns bright red.
5184939	5186060	Because that's what Angel did, too.
5186160	5187261	You know it, you know it, guys.
5188422	5189083	Because Angel...
5190743	5190963	Angel
5204666	5206227	and I've been playing it non-stop.
5207748	5209069	It's a great game, it really is.
5209349	5210449	Yeah, it's a great game.
5210750	5212110	But I'm looking forward to Ultramix 3.
5212591	5215172	It's going to be a heck of a fall with the Bomani releases.
5215192	5215892	I'm very excited.
5216893	5217533	Oh yeah, me too.
5218074	5219694	Not just Captain Jack, but the whole variety.
5219915	5221896	It's the MySpace DDR mix.
5222676	5224257	It's going to be a fun time.
5224958	5227159	God, God, I hate Good Charlotte.
5227179	5228520	I want them to burn in hell.
5228860	5231261	I know, but there's always going to be one song on the mix.
5231361	5234202	It's kind of like in Ultramix 2 there was La Cucaracha.
5234362	5235983	I mean, seriously, who the fuck plays that song?
5236203	5238944	I want them to go to heaven, because I'm already going to hell.
5238984	5239745	I don't want them there.
5239765	5241886	Hey, good point.
5243366	5246148	On that note, is there anything else you wanted to share with our listeners, GS191?
5248166	5248786	No, not really.
5249567	5252930	Well, thanks for the call.
5253690	5254151	Well, thank you.
5254311	5256393	All right, and thanks for listening, and call back.
5256453	5257093	Don't be a stranger.
5257914	5258174	All right.
5258755	5259115	Take care.
5259155	5259335	Bye.
5259556	5259816	Later.
5261137	5261698	One more call.
5261758	5263079	We're just lighting up with calls tonight.
5263099	5263779	This is crazy.
5264420	5266242	Getting this new phone number was probably the best thing we ever did.
5266362	5267283	Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.
5267323	5270786	Hey, it's me, the legend, Zaku.
5271046	5272067	Hey, Zaku, what's up?
5273206	5278568	Yeah, finally got to the phone after, you know, after trying to hammer Skype through, you know, through IPC.
5279308	5282410	Zaku, I don't know what, Zaku, we've been hammered like all night long.
5282450	5283090	It's crazy.
5283170	5283490	What's up?
5284530	5287852	Yeah, obviously you want my reaction to Captain Jack's death.
5287872	5288332	Sure.
5288632	5290593	It's a shame, it's a shame.
5290613	5294094	I was, you know, I was pretty much shocked.
5294955	5299636	As soon as I came home that night and found, you know, and just found out, good DDR freak.
5300697	5300997	I mean...
5302277	5310147	How, I mean, this pretty much hit us quickly, you know, I mean, all these events happen within a matter of a week.
5310988	5318898	Monday he collapses and then a few days later he loses his life, he loses his battle to survive, so...
5320484	5325227	I'm putting up a link right now in the chat room that I managed to find from a thread in Bomani Style about the US version of Beatmania.
5325287	5326487	It involves EV games again.
5349662	5354304	They managed to get the date right, but the pricing, you might want to take a look at.
5355824	5359605	Okay, so Zaku posted a link in our chat room, which is available at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
5359665	5365628	Click on chat, and he wants me to take a look at this, and check out what's going on on EBGames.com.
5365768	5366148	Wow!
5366708	5371410	Okay, so they're going to ship Beatmania for the PS2, and it's saying March 1st, 2006.
5373010	5374150	$49.99 is the price.
5374210	5375151	Oh, that's interesting, though, because...
5376783	5381050	Wait a minute, $49.99 for the game and $49.99 for the bundle?
5381872	5383394	Yes, I was saying the same shit too.
5383715	5388964	How come Konami, you know, I thought they were going to charge like $60 or $70 for that thing.
5390029	5395972	Where they're pretty much shooting themselves in the foot when they're letting folks get away with a $50 ticket.
5395992	5397633	Let me put it this way.
5418283	5420865	The game's announced for January and February.
5420905	5422826	We have about 24 of them.
5423287	5425108	Okay, March we have two.
5425808	5427409	So, I'm going to tell you this much.
5427890	5433033	They don't have any info when it's coming out yet because we haven't even gotten any info when that stuff's coming out, let alone other stuff.
5433253	5436255	There's stuff getting announced left and right we have no dates for, so it doesn't matter.
5437516	5440198	It is an interesting discovery, but I don't think it holds any weight.
5440418	5441599	It's just like the date for Halo 3.
5441779	5443240	I mean, no one knows when that's coming out.
5443260	5445101	They just put it on there saying take pre-orders.
5445262	5445642	Exactly.
5445662	5445862	Exactly.
5447408	5462998	Okay, but besides, well, besides that, you know, obviously, basically by the time I called you last night, you know, Digital Life was over, but I didn't manage to get the results of the last few tournaments.
5463679	5465460	Oh yeah, what happened with the rest of Digital Life?
5466360	5472644	Um, one of the, one of the, this cat I know, you know, who played DDR managed to win like, he managed to win two grand.
5473925	5476527	One of the, one of the players from within, from within New York City.
5477560	5481101	Very cool, congratulations.
5485182	5491824	But so far, you know, Sunday was probably the worst day you went, and I know people learn their lessons well.
5492725	5495806	The only good days are the ones that they have to, that they go freestyling.
5497006	5498006	Keep that in mind, folks.
5498787	5503228	Well, if I go to Digital Life next year, I'll keep that in mind, that Sunday is not the day for me to be there.
5503288	5504789	I'll take my flight home on Sunday next year.
5504809	5505129	You know,
5506873	5508334	Next year is going to be four days.
5508394	5514096	I'm assuming that the first day is going to be like a free play event and then the next three days is going to be the tournament.
5514376	5517437	If I go to Digital Life next year, though, it ain't going to be just for the tournament.
5517557	5518498	I want to take it all in.
5518558	5520639	So, you know, of course I'll go to the tournament, but you know.
5521879	5523780	Yeah, just make sure, now you know.
5524280	5527201	Now you know that it's in the middle of October next year.
5527382	5528682	And knowing is half the battle.
5529562	5530903	Yeah, it's GDI, Joe.
5531743	5533604	All right, anything else you want to share with our listeners, Zach?
5533664	5535705	I've got to get to more calls because we've got people hammering us.
5536569	5537929	Yeah, that's about it, man.
5538049	5538830	Okay.
5540270	5540950	Well, have a good one.
5541390	5542270	Thanks for the call, Zaku.
5542610	5543291	Goodbye.
5544071	5544551	Later.
5546591	5547551	We gotta get some more calls.
5548472	5549312	Hi, you're on Orange House Radio.
5550392	5550932	Hey, what's up?
5551012	5553833	It's DJ Ranma S. Hello, DJ Ranma S. What's on your mind?
5554553	5554913	Not much.
5554933	5556933	I just wanted to say a couple things about the captain.
5557334	5559274	You cosplayed the captain, didn't you?
5560214	5561654	No, but I'm planning on it.
5561734	5563975	Oh, I thought you said you had cosplayed him at one point.
5564443	5567726	No, I said I plan to hopefully maybe Captain Con next year.
5567826	5568267	My bad.
5568307	5568707	My bad.
5569668	5573672	Well, prepare to be surrounded by white women because that's what happens with Captain Jack.
5573892	5574472	Hey, I love it.
5575093	5575473	I love it.
5577523	5582326	Which is why he told me on... Oh, never mind, I'm not exactly a white animal.
5582346	5584508	Close enough, close enough.
5584648	5585549	Anyway, it doesn't matter.
5586109	5589351	Obviously, we're just kidding, you know, joking around when we say stuff like that.
5589531	5592053	Obviously, you know, it's all about people.
5592073	5592513	Hot bitches.
5592934	5593294	People.
5593434	5594655	Hot bitches of all types.
5595475	5599178	Actually, when he told me, I thought, you know, I was like,
5599761	5601302	Thank you for telling me, I appreciate that
5626480	5626920	No problem.
5627000	5629801	So anything else you want to share about the whole Captain Jack thing?
5630361	5631302	Yeah, a couple things.
5632802	5642666	One thing, Captain Jack, it means a lot to me because at An Amazement, I did a walk on as Naval Barrett to End the Navy, which is one of my personal favorite songs.
5643786	5645967	So, you know, it kind of,
5646394	5647194	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5659506	5666850	The circumstance and the fact that he was just a fun party guy and died at a young age just kind of makes you go, life sucks.
5667210	5667810	Life sucks.
5668711	5675834	I was just going to say, everybody that calls in, they have a memory of some song that they've heard before.
5676715	5681857	That obviously this guy was a strong presence for you all when you guys started getting into DDR.
5682178	5682998	So that is sad.
5683778	5686720	Wow, you said something profound on this show.
5686760	5687080	I did.
5687180	5688020	I can be profound.
5688040	5688661	Holy fuck!
5689912	5691373	Somebody note the date and time.
5691513	5692754	No, you're absolutely right.
5692874	5694696	Someone stop the presses.
5695256	5700720	Because Captain Jack is so, he's got such a strong personality and his songs are very unique.
5701200	5705604	Like him or not, you know a Captain Jack song when you hear it because it sounds like somebody's barking orders at you.
5706004	5711288	And people remember that with DDR and people have such fond memories about DDR and playing DDR with their friends.
5711528	5714791	Kind of like how I was saying in the opening of the show when, you know, only you.
5715191	5717533	Everybody would get down and, you know, throw all your hands up.
5717553	5718053	Hands up.
5718093	5718994	And everybody would do it.
5719054	5719314	And like,
5719674	5719875	Thank you.
5737059	5737539	You're welcome.
5738159	5739540	Sorry, Ranma, I didn't mean to.
5739560	5739860	It's okay.
5740560	5741440	Anything else you want to share?
5742041	5743521	Yeah, two things before I go.
5743601	5743921	Sure.
5743941	5747502	Another reason why Captain Jack needs something to me, I want to post this link.
5747882	5753504	Someone, YTMND, as Sailor Barrett, and if you click on it, you hear In the Navy.
5754604	5757005	I'm afraid to bring that up because YTMND... It's a good one.
5757165	5758405	It's a good one, seriously.
5758485	5763307	But my computer doesn't like YTMND, so I don't know if I can pull it up, but chat room, go for it.
5764634	5768896	and right here, standing in front of my computer, I have a can of Budweiser.
5769196	5770496	Crack one open for the captain.
5772197	5773457	Pour a 40 for me.
5775278	5776638	Damn, I'm not that ghetto, son.
5779519	5779919	I am.
5779939	5785381	A whiff is like that, but you're going to have a good old time at CatDew.
5785901	5787142	Hell yeah, hell yeah.
5787182	5788602	Maybe I should cosplay as the captain.
5790063	5790163	Um...
5793250	5794531	I know some single gay guys.
5811670	5812250	No, I'm just kidding.
5812310	5812991	Anyway, let's get to it.
5813912	5814512	One more call.
5814552	5818595	I keep saying that, but I keep seeing all these names that have been hammering us.
5818895	5819115	What?
5819355	5826040	I've been seeing all these names hammering us all night long, and I know that people want to say stuff about the captain, so I feel an obligation to get to all these calls.
5826340	5827701	So this is the last one for now.
5828141	5829082	Hi, you're on Arizona Radio.
5831123	5831944	Oh, wow, I'm the last one?
5831984	5832785	I feel privileged.
5832825	5833865	It's SSJ100 Matt.
5833885	5838469	Well, I see you've been hammering us for like 30 minutes, so I feel bad for you, so I wanted to let you through.
5838529	5838889	What's up?
5839673	5840553	Yeah, I'm pretty pathetic.
5841754	5842374	It's all good.
5842474	5843074	We appreciate it.
5844535	5844995	No, nothing.
5845035	5849217	I just found out the bad news by Captain Jack after coming back from seeing Doom.
5849697	5851098	So that's two bad things in a row.
5852058	5853279	Oh, shit.
5853299	5855280	You know things come in threes, too.
5855460	5856720	So brace yourself.
5856760	5858421	Well, you're listening to this program, I suppose.
5858521	5859661	And warts.
5859782	5860082	Who knows?
5865789	5868932	Don't have sex in the next 24 hours, because you're bound to catch something.
5869273	5871915	Because bad things come in threes, so be careful.
5872876	5879183	Well, I'm about to go play the new Budokai Tenkaichi with my roommate after this.
5879583	5880764	It's going to blow up your console.
5881745	5882746	Or I'll get raped.
5886570	5886970	Either way.
5887010	5888292	What are your thoughts on Captain Jack?
5892246	5893429	I'm just disappointed.
5893450	5898303	I'm not going to hear any new songs from anymore on any of the new DDRs.
5900370	5900771	I don't know.
5901391	5904474	Maybe he's like Tupac and he has a bunch of songs that haven't been released.
5904754	5905615	Yeah, you never know.
5906756	5907797	Maybe he's still alive somewhere.
5907837	5910120	Maybe the whole damn thing is a conspiracy.
5910880	5911921	They'll find him in Mexico.
5913082	5914764	Mexico, Canada.
5914984	5917126	I can see the hate mail coming in right now.
5917146	5918287	Anything else on your mind?
5922312	5925315	Nope, other than Doom was a disappointment.
5927036	5930158	Was that first person stuff as stupid as it looked in the preview?
5931099	5938023	Well, to tell you the truth, they only really had it for about two to five minutes of the last part of the movie.
5938043	5938364	Really?
5938644	5940385	That still seems like a long time.
5940465	5942346	Five minutes is a goddamn long time.
5942667	5946489	Seriously, though, the way that they hyped it up, it was supposed to be like the big thing in the movie.
5946509	5948631	Well, thank God, because that shit looked cheesy.
5949716	5951998	It did, but you know... Yeah, it was cheesy.
5952739	5959364	And they did not have... Somebody in chat, I don't know if it was you or somebody else, I just saw it fly by in the chat room earlier, said that the flying eyeballs are not in the movie.
5960305	5961606	Yeah, yeah, I said that.
5961626	5962506	That's bullshit.
5963207	5969052	I was expecting like flaming skulls and skeletons with rocket launchers on their shoulders, but...
5969602	5974886	I think it was Roger Ebert that said that the best thing in the film was, like, the beginning Universal logo.
5975287	5977428	Like, there was some big thing that they did at the beginning.
5977829	5980111	Like, was that the best thing in the film?
5983633	5987637	No, you know, they had a couple subtle things in the movie.
5989015	5992857	The best thing about Doom will probably be the trailer for Harry Potter beforehand.
5992877	5993697	Harry Potter, oh my god.
5994158	5994498	Yay.
5995058	5995378	Anyway.
5996499	5996859	Alright.
5997839	6002822	Alright, Matt, we gotta go because we gotta get to a break here because we're tired and we've been taking calls for like the past hour.
6002942	6003562	Okay.
6003822	6004523	But have a good one.
6004543	6005483	Thanks for calling in, okay?
6006343	6006964	Peace out, man.
6006984	6007504	Alright, later.
6007984	6008665	Yep, bye.
6009285	6009485	Bye.
6011445	6012665	Thank you guys for calling in.
6012966	6014066	Whole shitload of calls tonight.
6014086	6014706	We appreciate it.
6014746	6015527	Sorry to those of you guys.
6015567	6017207	I hope we got to everybody at least once.
6017287	6019648	I really, really apologize to those of you guys we didn't get to.
6020348	6021429	We'll get to you guys a little bit later.
6021829	6022729	Hopefully, if we have time.
6023209	6024890	And try not to kill yourself on the way out, Xtfer.
6026511	6027211	Alright, anyway.
6028391	6029212	Let's go to a break.
6029312	6030052	Damn, I need a break.
6030072	6032293	And I promised somebody we could hear Little Boy.
6032973	6035294	So we're going to play that song from DDR Max 2.
6037373	6042017	And when we come back, we will probably get into the cage match and talk about some other stuff as well.
6042857	6044639	So let's go to a break.
6044879	6047581	I know that microphone is being awful.
6050703	6052505	It was left on for some reason.
6053185	6053425	All right.
6054606	6055347	We're going to play this.
6055427	6057248	It's actually the full version of Little Boy.
6057288	6060571	We'll play that and a couple other little Captain Jack songs, and we'll be back after this.
6065993	6071355	Dream on my little boy, dream on my little boy, dream on my little boy, go out and have some joy.
6117463	6119492	Dream on my little boy, dream on my little boy
6166857	6178648	Dream on my little boy, dream on my little boy, dream on my little boy, go out and have some joy Little boy, dream on my little boy, dream on my little boy, go out and have some joy
6197746	6201648	Hey, little boy, do you think you're Mr. Right?
6201688	6208832	A girl like me still wants to choose the man, the only one she wants to be Realize reality, you're not Mr. Right Running on that one big street alone
6231295	6231496	Cool!
6255538	6257079	Thanks for watching!
6501318	6502200	Thanks for watching!
6515768	6524331	Hi-ho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter V, the letter A, and the number 59.
6524371	6530494	Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?
6530574	6531354	Listen, Frog!
6532495	6533335	Hi-yo!
6534595	6535236	I love the Muppets.
6535836	6538557	Uh, anyway, we're back on Orange Lounge Radio.
6539983	6548733	In that break, you heard Captain Jack with Little Boy, the original, and oh my gosh, the chat room freaked out because I wasn't playing the remix that's in DDR, and it was the original.
6549754	6552558	But, you know, it gives you guys a chance to hear maybe something you haven't heard before.
6553018	6553499	Imagine that.
6553879	6559526	Aiko Aiko from DanceMania21, and Dancing Pompokolin from DDR Fifth Mix.
6560489	6560949	Good times.
6561189	6566172	And did you notice, Extifer, I'm sure you noticed this, the lyrics in Ico Ico, did you hear Set Your Fag on Fire?
6566252	6566532	I did.
6566692	6567973	Because you pointed it out.
6568013	6572455	Yes, at Captain Jack's request, we will be setting Extifer on fire at the end of the show.
6574476	6575456	How funny.
6575476	6576657	We're going to set our fag on fire.
6576677	6579498	Take you with me, bitch.
6583981	6585241	We're going to go over to Loki.
6585321	6586542	Loki's actually got some...
6589565	6599289	I was looking for that, because I don't see it.
6600269	6601770	It was there, but it's gone.
6603150	6612854	No, someone, of course, making games for the PSP, and the one that they had on there, which I can't find for the life of me, is called Button Mash Revolution.
6614375	6614455	It
6616207	6618468	Like DDR, but, you know, not.
6620968	6624189	And I can't find any info on it because the fucking links are gone.
6624309	6633251	So, fuck them for updating their stupid website and not having, like most websites do, you know, news archive where you can go to the next page and next page and next page.
6633891	6636292	No, we're too good for that.
6637212	6638432	So, fucking A, but...
6639963	6641266	Yeah, it was really cool looking.
6641948	6646458	I wish I could talk more about it, but I can't find the goddamn link, so... Yay!
6648154	6649635	So we'll go from here.
6649675	6650756	Live radio, boys and girls.
6651736	6653437	Hey, I got Bomani-related news.
6653557	6654138	Go ahead.
6654238	6658280	Okay, I just remembered this, because something that was just said in the chat room reminded me of this.
6658701	6662603	You know they showed a little preview of the new Madonna video for Hung Up?
6663484	6669187	The super gay, gay, gay, gay, gay, gay song that's coming out very soon.
6669588	6673890	They showed a little preview of the video on Total Request Live, and somebody put it on the internet.
6673910	6674471	Well, get this.
6675191	6676612	Freaking DDRs in the video.
6676632	6680633	Should I show this in the little... I'll even post this link in the chat room.
6681593	6694298	I'm going to post the link to the little video clip that they have, and I'll play it in the studio, see what you guys think here about this clip of Hung Up, which actually, I guess it's not really DDR, but it's actually Dancing Stage Fusion, but, you know, DDR.
6694318	6694918	It's still DDR.
6695899	6697039	It's DDR under a different name.
6697319	6699040	But, you know, Madonna, she's got to be so British.
6702162	6702743	Madonna's New...
6725781	6730306	It's got a video, and I can't play it in Firefox.
6730426	6737913	I have to open up Internet Explorer because Firefox won't play that clip, but I want to play it for you guys in studio.
6739935	6740596	And here we go.
6740856	6743018	Again, that's posted in our chat room at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
6743038	6745861	Click on chat, and here it is for us in studio.
6767049	6771753	Yeah, so you can see, like, what was Madonna doing at the end of the clip there?
6771813	6775156	She's like doing that rolling in the dough thing on the DDR machine.
6775196	6779720	She's really getting down on that machine, and she's kind of surrounded by her dancers, so...
6780967	6783970	DDR is making it into the mainstream, that's for sure.
6783990	6784951	Madonna bugs me.
6785973	6786593	And you're gay!
6786834	6787855	I know, I can't stand it.
6787895	6792600	I've never really liked her, except for with the exception of her Oh Father video.
6793301	6797766	But, I don't know, just something about her, she's just pretentious.
6797826	6800189	So has DDR officially jumped the shark with this or something?
6800209	6800349	Yeah.
6801649	6802069	I don't know.
6802149	6803850	I mean, I can't stand the song.
6804150	6806171	I think the song absolutely sucks.
6806811	6810392	That's what you said when I played it the other day.
6810752	6812653	I did not say that I liked that song.
6812813	6814713	He didn't say you liked it, but he said it wasn't that bad.
6815753	6817694	I didn't say anything about it, I don't think.
6819094	6820635	I don't even like the ABBA original.
6821875	6823636	Everybody hating me now because I just said that.
6823656	6823916	No, I don't.
6824456	6824996	It's fine.
6826957	6827237	Okay.
6827457	6828537	But DDR in the video?
6829098	6830158	Good thing or bad thing for DDR?
6831345	6832586	I mean, that's cool and everything.
6832626	6834347	Madonna, obviously, is huge.
6835607	6841491	By her having the video game in her video, that's a big deal.
6842311	6844873	But, you know, just me, a personal thing, I don't like her.
6845853	6846253	Okay.
6847694	6850436	What do you think, Loki, as a straight guy...
6852335	6858439	who, you know, as this Madonna doing an ABBA thing must be very, very, very gay.
6858779	6861421	And now to see DDR in the video makes it gay-y gay.
6862181	6862662	What do you think?
6863282	6875230	I think she's just trying to, you know, throw as much pop culture references in there, you know, to... She's insane, just like, you know, frickin' Tom Cruise, okay?
6875490	6878512	They're all lumped together, frickin' crazy-ass people.
6878905	6879445	You know what?
6879746	6884309	The last thing I'd be doing once I got lots of money would be going insane.
6886210	6888371	It's like, hmm, I have lots of money to buy stuff.
6888451	6890072	No, I think I'll go insane instead.
6890212	6891353	Let's just denounce everything.
6891433	6893635	Let's be as whacked out crazy as possible.
6893655	6897837	Let's become Jewish, and then Catholic, and then Jewish, and then Catholic, and then Jewish, and then Catholic.
6898318	6899078	And then Kambala.
6900139	6900959	And Scientologist.
6901840	6904442	Yeah, so, you know, Esther can go fuck my ass.
6906083	6906823	Stupid Esther.
6907544	6907804	Esther!
6908671	6909692	I like Madonna.
6909792	6912493	I don't like Ugo over Madonna, but, you know, she's cool.
6912573	6913553	I respect what she's doing.
6913713	6915194	No, you mean Esther.
6915214	6920716	I mean, you've got to respect Madonna's freestyle, though, in the video, because she's looking away from the screen.
6921136	6922317	So I give her points for that.
6922357	6927319	And somebody in the chatroom says, OMG, Madonna is AAA-ing Paranoia, Survivor, Max, Oni, S4R.
6929400	6930120	You guys are nerds.
6930320	6932021	And making a music video at the same time.
6932421	6935542	Angel, DDR in a Madonna video.
6935842	6937223	Good for DDR or bad news?
6940963	6941823	I don't know.
6942343	6945404	I guess it's okay, but it's Madonna.
6948986	6949226	No.
6952927	6955008	Nobody heard that.
6955128	6958470	I just said she should have done Like A Virgin.
6958510	6964692	If she's going to do a DDR video, she should have done a live version of her Like A Virgin where she humped the stage.
6965412	6966573	You know, the dancing stage.
6968760	6974764	Okay, and on that note, Sky... Loki, do you have anything else going on in the DDR world you want to share?
6975004	6977506	Didn't the new website open up or something, speaking of gay?
6980808	6990735	Yeah, the Ultramix 3 website was launched, and they changed the freaking logo on us to something that's super-duper gaytastic.
6991135	6992236	So what's the logo look like now?
6992696	6997239	Well, let me just pull it up for you, since that's what I do nowadays.
7000655	7003456	Actually, what I'll do... It's really bad.
7003656	7009237	Basically, it's kind of this party theme with a giant friggin' rainbow going through it.
7010458	7014779	So, um... Yeah, basically... Here it is, right here.
7015039	7015299	Okay.
7017220	7017680	Be afraid.
7019060	7022441	It's giant rainbow-ass revolution... It's rainbow-tastic.
7022461	7025422	Hey, Emmy's got her outfit from the graduation video.
7025762	7028303	I'll make a lot of fanboys happy because that skirt is very short.
7028814	7030416	Slut Emmy would have been better.
7030796	7032397	But anyways, there it is.
7032678	7037202	Ultramix 3 with its stupid rainbow-tastic stuff.
7038463	7038684	Yeah.
7040025	7040465	Interesting.
7042727	7043809	So that was really lame.
7044009	7053318	But they did have, there's some screenshots on there which, you know, sort of, you know, that's where we got all the, you know, new songs that were coming out and stuff.
7054011	7055532	Hung up by Madonna to match the theme, you think?
7055552	7058513	Maybe a secret license in Ultramix 3?
7058553	7060974	I don't know about that, but...
7083826	7088369	Alright, let's get into the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match tonight, shall we boys and girls?
7088930	7089730	It is about that time.
7092132	7095274	The way the Cage Match works, as a reminder, we're going to play three songs for you guys.
7095314	7098857	You kids get to vote for your favorite song, but you have to be in the chat room to vote.
7099697	7101679	You do, or else you're going to lose.
7102952	7105134	Anyway, so we're going to do the chat room tonight.
7105174	7107196	Three songs in the cage match.
7107236	7111800	You only get to hear a clip of last week's winner, though, because you already heard it last week.
7111840	7115002	And it actually won two weeks in a row now, so it's going for its third win.
7115463	7119526	The group is called Pendulum, and the song is called Hold Your Color.
7119907	7122209	And it's song number one you can vote for in tonight's cage match.
7122249	7122729	So get ready.
7122769	7125872	Here comes the clip of song number one, Pendulum with Hold Your Color.
7132749	7134611	When they take everything away
7282393	7284235	Alright, that was song number one.
7285416	7287998	Last week's winner, Pendulum with Hold Your Color.
7288539	7294464	Alright, we're going to get into song number two tonight, and song number two comes to us courtesy of Loki.
7295045	7296666	Loki, what did you pick for us tonight?
7297927	7302792	I picked, as I promised last week, I picked Pendulum again.
7306104	7307646	There's no rules about this.
7308247	7310269	This is Slam by Pendulum.
7310409	7313793	I was going to edit in the intro, but then I realized that the song would be too long.
7314333	7320200	As a reminder, last week, Loki was pissed that Pendulum won, so he decided to put another Pendulum song in.
7320660	7322983	It lost, so he's doing it again.
7325045	7325206	So...
7326397	7327138	I'm going to make a rule.
7327158	7327818	We're going to make a rule.
7327838	7330080	Jamie and I are going to get together and make a rule and outvote your ass.
7330240	7332802	Like, no more Pendulum and Cage Match ever or something.
7332822	7334683	And then Shane will be mad at you because it'll be your fault.
7334703	7335864	It's not going to be my fault.
7335904	7336625	It'll be your fault.
7337445	7337885	That's fine.
7337926	7339847	I'll just put other... I'll put girls in again.
7339987	7340547	Oh, shit.
7340607	7340988	Alright.
7342409	7342869	Here it is.
7342969	7344610	Song number two in tonight's Cage Match.
7344690	7346412	Pendulum with Slam.
7404956	7405860	on this small place.
7550734	7559345	were marooned on a small island in an endless sea, confined to a tiny spit of sand, unable to escape.
7559365	7561628	But tonight, it's heavy stuff, heavy stuff.
7693471	7696554	Song number two in tonight's cage match, Pendulum with Slam.
7696614	7700897	Let's see, was that song slammin' or do you want to slam that song into the ground?
7700977	7707122	Loki, give it a ten, because if you drive with that song really loud on your radio, it has a lot of bass in it.
7707162	7707543	It's cool.
7708904	7709104	Angel.
7711616	7715298	Um, that makes me wanna, like, go kill a lion now or something.
7715358	7719881	Sorry to those that play Alliance, but, um... God, this thing doesn't sound like it's on.
7720021	7720402	Huh!
7721062	7721382	It's on.
7721542	7721823	Okay.
7722023	7725565	Um... Oh, hell.
7726265	7726686	Seven.
7729407	7730008	I got bored.
7730208	7730528	Three.
7731269	7731669	Extra room.
7733496	7742405	I kind of got bored too, but Loki did make a good point that this would be a good song to blast out your Harvard.
7742766	7744788	Yeah, if you want to put the other people on the road to sleep.
7746410	7748752	Well, you don't knock it until you've tried it.
7749413	7749773	Okay.
7749994	7752136	Alright, so I give it an 8 for that.
7752697	7752997	Alright.
7754537	7756517	Remember, it's not our thoughts that count.
7756598	7757298	It's yours.
7757398	7758378	You have the final say.
7758418	7760238	Here's song number three in tonight's cage match.
7760378	7766700	Even though the lovely DarkSakura is not here tonight, she was kind enough to provide this song for you guys.
7766800	7768440	It's song number three, her song tonight.
7768920	7771401	It's an artist that was in DDR USA.
7772801	7774522	I shouldn't say DDR USA.
7774542	7776482	I should say DDR Extreme USA.
7777062	7778003	It's Junior Senior.
7778523	7778883	Remember them?
7778903	7779683	They did Move Your Feet.
7780563	7781704	This is another song by them.
7781764	7783344	It's called Shake Your Coconuts.
7784721	7786603	So get ready to shake your coconuts to this song.
7786643	7788125	It's song number three in tonight's skating match.
7788205	7788446	Enjoy.
7863851	7864900	Thanks for watching!
7914286	7915268	Thank you for watching!
7939016	7943038	Alright, song number three in tonight's cage match, Junior Senior with Shake Your Coconuts.
7943098	7944439	Did you shake your coconuts?
7945179	7946620	Or was that song just nuts?
7946720	7947060	I don't know.
7947120	7947481	Loki.
7948541	7949182	Get Loki a mic.
7950342	7951043	That was lame.
7951063	7952763	That was really lame.
7953604	7954724	That was awful lame.
7955305	7956145	It gives a four.
7957106	7957526	Angel.
7961648	7962269	It was okay.
7962889	7967051	I don't mind that song, but, um, no.
7967952	7968572	Six and a half.
7970632	7971273	X-Deferred!
7972294	7976317	Forgive me for saying this, but I felt like busting a nut.
7978980	7981042	God damn it, I hate you!
7981723	7984966	They said shake your coconut till the nut comes out or something like that.
7985046	7985666	I think so, yes.
7986087	7987648	That's pretty foul.
7988008	7989610	I give it, like I said, for that.
7990478	7994519	So vote for song 2 because we don't want song 1 to win.
7994659	7996719	Because I'm behind Loki's whole scheme here.
7996839	7997240	Shut up.
7998900	8001040	I thought that song was awesome, you know why?
8001180	8002721	Because it wasn't Pendulum.
8003261	8007502	So therefore it gets an 8 automatically because it was awesome for not being Pendulum.
8007622	8010062	I don't think 8 really translates to awesome, Rob.
8010242	8011083	It's not orgasmic.
8012043	8013583	No, no, no, I don't think it really does.
8013603	8014663	8 is, you know what, shut up.
8015264	8015804	Orgasmic would be 11.
8015844	8016144	Shut up.
8019383	8022145	Let's recap the songs you can vote for in tonight's cage match.
8022625	8026748	Song number one is Pendulum with Hold Your Color.
8026848	8027769	It's last week's winner.
8036014	8039637	And song number two you can vote for in tonight's cage match is Slam.
8051497	8055419	And song number three you can vote for tonight is Junior Senior with Shake Your Coconuts.
8065083	8067324	Place vote now.
8067404	8070245	Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.
8071035	8072076	and we'll let you know who won.
8072276	8073497	Remember, it's not up to us.
8073637	8076239	We're just big idiots.
8076259	8077781	We're like the American Idol judges.
8077801	8079602	Yeah, kind of, and it really isn't up to us.
8080823	8081944	You would be Paula Abdul.
8082565	8083625	I'm not Paula Abdul.
8083745	8086027	You're totally the Paula Abdul.
8086468	8087749	I'm Randy Dog.
8089030	8089991	What up, Dog?
8090111	8091092	What up, Dog?
8091232	8094594	I can't stand that fucking show right now.
8094634	8096036	You watch it every year!
8096476	8099719	I know, and the thing is, it's just like TV crack.
8100455	8107162	You know, it's like you have to watch something that's kind of a guilty pleasure that you can't stand, but you watch it anyway.
8107182	8109684	Kind of like Jerry Springer.
8110365	8111686	Ringmaster was on TV today.
8111726	8113088	I had to watch it, or some of it.
8113889	8116892	Because I actually saw Ringmaster in the theater the day it opened.
8117633	8118754	Four people in the theater.
8121797	8123879	Me and my roommate at the time and some other schmoes.
8124915	8125556	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8141658	8144802	Day 2 is Send My Kids to Boot Camp
8158464	8160485	Day 3 is my baby fat.
8162626	8166068	Day 4 would be I know I'm fat but I'm gorgeous.
8166448	8174793	How many times have you accidentally found yourself channel surfing and the channel lands on Maury Povich and it's about their baby being fat?
8176233	8178735	Like, dude, stop feeding your kid!
8180616	8182017	Like, shit!
8185051	8186372	and we're supposed to feel sympathy.
8186412	8190835	The mom's like, fuck, bitch, talk to your kid.
8194237	8197719	I suppose we should get into the, do you have a movie review for us tonight, Extifer?
8197879	8198379	I forgot to ask.
8198459	8200241	Oh, Extifer, I forgot to mention.
8200921	8203022	Our work, because, you know, I work at a video distributor.
8203783	8207485	Wednesday, we get, in our theater, we get to watch Serenity.
8207945	8209166	So, for free.
8210147	8210527	And we get pizza!
8210547	8211287	That's pretty damn awesome.
8211388	8212588	That is double awesome.
8212608	8213589	Well, I hope you enjoy it.
8214011	8220555	You know, seeing Serenity for free is about the only way people are seeing it these days, apparently, because the movie's not making any money right now.
8222236	8224457	You, that is very funny to you, isn't it?
8225278	8227579	Sadistic bitch.
8227999	8236885	No, but, you know, I saw it for free, actually, you know, a few months, or a couple months ago, maybe, a month and a half, and it was really good free.
8237445	8239566	But it was also good when I paid money, so, you know.
8240747	8240847	Yeah.
8240867	8240947	Yeah.
8242383	8243884	Are you going to do a movie review for us tonight?
8245005	8247067	Sure, I'll think up a movie review.
8247147	8250369	I haven't seen really any movies this week, so I'll think up one.
8250809	8252050	Just don't play the gay music.
8254172	8255433	We'll get to your gay review later.
8255573	8258034	My fiance's been watching Desperate Housewives.
8258255	8258915	Oh, God.
8259596	8261397	She's jumped on that bandwagon.
8263138	8264059	Everybody pity me.
8265440	8266941	Next thing you know, it's going to be Lost, too.
8268815	8270577	Like this bitch watches every week.
8270677	8272099	We have the season one box set.
8272179	8275603	It's in my pile of stuff that's going to be returned to GameStop for games.
8278126	8280489	But yeah, we have Lost and she wants to watch that too.
8280509	8281070	I'm like, no.
8283906	8285727	We need to get to your sim update, Loki.
8285767	8287968	What's going on in the sim scene?
8287988	8291809	Okay, okay, I actually do have the story now about that stupid button mash revolution thing.
8293030	8295971	Finally found it because, you know, PSP updates hide their shit.
8296331	8299413	Anyways, it's this game called Button Mash Revolution Version 1.
8299973	8300833	It's for the PSP.
8300853	8303634	You can only run it if you have a version 1.5 firmware.
8305835	8308618	And basically, it's like DDR, except you use your buttons.
8308658	8309539	There are no arrows.
8309619	8312541	Instead, there are the four corresponding buttons that are on the PSP.
8313282	8315984	And there's music in it, and someone made it in Lua.
8317125	8322090	So I don't really know what kind of music is in it, because I haven't downloaded it yet, but it looks kind of fun.
8322190	8328175	So if you're looking for something to waste some space on your memory card, check it out at PSPUpdates.com.
8328215	8329456	You're going to have to actually...
8330270	8331411	Button Mash Revolution Version 1
8344827	8346008	DJ Max Portable
8368942	8372404	Just be really awesome to see some more music games coming to the PSP.
8372744	8379387	And if you want to check out the website, I believe it's DJMax.com, but I'm not positive.
8380408	8383149	Just search for DJ Max, and I'm sure you'll find it.
8385390	8389172	And other than that, really, I don't think there's too much else going on in the sim scene.
8390313	8396456	I haven't been really paying attention to the sim scene because nothing really interesting has been going on for me.
8397301	8401024	You know, tournaments and stuff, just like, eh, don't care.
8403346	8406729	Well, I'm glad you're a faithful reporter in the sim industry.
8406809	8408831	There's really nothing going on, honestly.
8408911	8413455	I mean, I'm sure if MySaw had their sim section up, there'd be more crappy remixes of Max.
8414076	8417279	But unfortunately, I can't report on that because there is no sim section anymore.
8417799	8422043	I do know of a new torrent site that came up that has some stuff on it, but...
8423991	8425313	Yeah, that's about it.
8426254	8429838	I'm more interested in checking out Ultramix 3 when that comes out in a couple weeks.
8430339	8434585	As well as all my 360 games coming at the same time.
8434605	8436567	I know I gotta save my money for the 360.
8437208	8440272	I'm not looking forward to spending that kind of money, but what can you do?
8440589	8441029	That's okay.
8441510	8442751	I'm going to be getting my controllers.
8442791	8444192	I've got about four games lined up.
8444512	8447694	Just, you know, with all the store credit I've earned in the last few months.
8448215	8449596	And just fun stuff like that.
8449876	8456441	And hopefully, because now it's the first party, hopefully I can hit up some of our publishers and go, Hey, can you send me a free copy?
8456801	8457202	Hey, come on.
8458363	8462286	Xbox Live, they're taking it down for a day to do some adjustments or something.
8462346	8466349	So are they going to have the Xbox 360 interface on the regular Xbox or something?
8466369	8466709	I don't know.
8467489	8469650	Well, they're taking down live because they're updating everything.
8469910	8477913	They're going to actually have a website now where you can download all your stats and everything on live and people can actually view all that stuff, what games you're playing, what accomplishments you've done.
8478554	8485116	They've been announcing more stuff for the Xbox Live Arcade, the new one being Tetris is now on there because Tetris is on every system on the man.
8485236	8485396	Yep.
8486017	8486157	And...
8487290	8489612	Just lots of cool stuff they're doing for live.
8490052	8495876	I'm hoping that they're not using the same gamer tags, though, because I really want to get on there first and get Loki.
8496957	8498838	I'm wondering if they're going to carry the gamer tags over.
8499278	8500539	I don't think so.
8500819	8501660	I wouldn't think so.
8501680	8503041	It would be interesting if they did.
8503121	8503501	They might.
8503541	8504062	Who knows?
8504122	8506323	I think they would have to for the backwards compatibility thing.
8506343	8507044	I think they'd have to.
8507444	8507704	Maybe.
8507724	8508244	Well, that's okay.
8508284	8509866	I have a backup name just in case.
8510066	8510426	What's that?
8511292	8513174	I can't say, because someone's going to steal it.
8513715	8514075	Oh, okay.
8514896	8518220	It's not too far from, you know, the name I go by.
8518441	8518781	Okay.
8519522	8520703	Like, Super Loki?
8521344	8521524	Loki 6969?
8521564	8521624	No.
8526050	8526350	No.
8526931	8530554	Don't say my frickin' World of Warcraft name on air.
8531995	8533957	Or, um, well, you know, close enough.
8533977	8535298	He doesn't have a mic, it doesn't matter.
8535318	8536960	I know, this is a good thing.
8538521	8542084	Okay, um, let's get to Extraverse Movie Review before we get to a break.
8542925	8543706	You don't have a movie yet?
8543866	8544947	Okay, fine, then we'll have to go to a break.
8546547	8548228	To be continued.
8820104	8821025	Thanks for watching!
8863130	8863951	Thanks for watching!
8891212	8891472	and more.
8944653	8947781	Thanks for watching!
9040905	9041866	Gaming Radio.
9042106	9049389	So uncensored that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.
9049550	9050890	Orange Lounge Radio.
9051551	9053712	Hi kids!
9055112	9055693	Hello.
9055913	9057734	We're back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
9058780	9061261	Just having ourselves a good old time on this Sunday evening.
9061461	9063962	Thank you for deciding to tune in and listen to us.
9064082	9064883	We appreciate it.
9065803	9066984	Although I'm kind of tired today.
9067024	9069885	I'm just like, kind of sluggish.
9069905	9071366	I know, it's a lazy Sunday.
9071386	9074247	Of course, we were up like totally late last night.
9074307	9079650	And I've been doing a little drinking, so maybe I have a little bit of a hangover.
9079890	9080910	Maybe a little bit.
9081291	9082051	Just a little bit.
9083792	9084112	We'll see.
9085662	9090405	So, I guess now is the part of the show where I'm not going to do extra first movie review.
9090785	9090945	Oh.
9091565	9093546	Because I want to tell you guys who won tonight's cage match.
9094647	9094967	Okay.
9095267	9096748	Which is certainly something we need to hear about.
9097528	9101591	So the winner of tonight's cage match, it was one vote deciding things tonight, you guys.
9101611	9103812	It was a very, very close cage match.
9104492	9106413	Except for song number two, which got like no votes.
9108454	9111916	But the winning song by one vote in tonight's cage match is...
9114226	9120989	The Pendulum, Hold Your Color, for the third week in a row.
9121109	9123730	Next week, it goes for retirement.
9123830	9126411	If it is the winner next week, it will be retired.
9126771	9129352	It will be the first song to be retired in quite a while.
9129632	9137395	I think we had a song get retired by default, but I don't even remember because we missed two shows, and so it kind of held over for four weeks.
9137435	9138036	I want to say it was...
9139591	9142193	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
9167159	9167619	No!
9167920	9171663	Okay, I spoke out of... I didn't mean to say that.
9173604	9174605	And I'm starting to review.
9174625	9175506	You can't play the song now.
9175666	9176507	Okay, well... Oh, look.
9176767	9177528	You can't play it.
9177948	9179589	What are you going to be reviewing?
9179990	9182292	The movie I'm reviewing this week is Sphere.
9183272	9186715	Remember that movie, Terror Can Fill Any Space?
9187456	9187636	No.
9188216	9188337	Oh.
9188757	9192360	Well, that's what it says on the box art of Sphere.
9193337	9199404	And it's from the best-selling author of Jurassic Park and The Lost World, otherwise known as Michael Crichton.
9201306	9202907	Little info on some critics here.
9203087	9208213	Janet Maslin from the New York Times called it rich in techno terror.
9209215	9212118	A Solid Thriller Directed with Sustained Tension
9225831	9241438	Anyways, so I think Sphere was okay, I mean it wasn't great, but if you want to see Queen Latifah get killed by jellyfish, then I guess that would be the movie to watch, like her getting killed by jellyfish.
9242839	9244140	Rob, do you have anything to add to that?
9246421	9248522	From getting eaten by jellyfish to Pizza Hut commercials.
9249096	9260704	Yeah, basically the movie, the premise of the movie is that everybody's fears manifest themselves and they're down under, like deep, deep, deep into the ocean or water or whatever.
9261584	9266688	And basically, like, people get killed by their own fears, basically.
9267108	9269390	And Queen Latifah... Hey, Hector, can you hold on a minute?
9273512	9274793	Sorry, I'm rocking out a little bit.
9275714	9276454	Of course you are.
9277415	9278135	Okay, sorry, go ahead.
9279594	9285216	So, I'm sorry, I just got, I got stupid just then, because you played that song.
9285717	9300403	Um, no, the, so the movie basically is, it's really average, um, you know, I would give it a thumb sideways, um, because, you know, I'd give it an apathetic thumb anywhere, because I don't really care.
9301204	9305707	Um, and, um, you know, again, Queen Latifah died from jellyfish in it.
9306288	9309330	Again, I'd like to reiterate, she died from jellyfish.
9309350	9310691	She was like, oh my god!
9311771	9313873	I got killed by some damn jellyfish!
9315954	9322339	Oh my god, I gotta do Pizza Hut commercials, and I have to do Bringin' Down the House with Steve Martin in a few years.
9322399	9324320	I can't die from some damn jellyfish?
9325261	9326221	And don't forget Chicago.
9327082	9327862	Chicago, too!
9328303	9330184	When you're good to mama, mama's good to you, remember?
9330546	9331067	That's right.
9332027	9336131	She said, damn, god damn jellyfish.
9336171	9338273	No, the jellyfish, that was really funny.
9338314	9340295	And she acts really scared in it.
9340376	9340756	It's great.
9341701	9342842	That's the best scene in the movie.
9343342	9344663	Oh, Queen Latifah getting eaten by jellyfish?
9344683	9346004	Yeah, being eaten by jellyfish.
9346244	9347085	Or being killed by jellyfish.
9347125	9350867	So, Spear gets this apathetic thumb, but Queen Latifah getting eaten by jellyfish is the thumbs up.
9350887	9352408	That is really the high point of the movie.
9352428	9356431	It's really kind of at the beginning, so I would recommend that part.
9356511	9360074	So, I'm glad you listened to my little, you know, segment here.
9360334	9361234	It was so interesting.
9363656	9364376	Listen tomorrow.
9364416	9364857	It's my new show.
9364877	9365337	I'm rocking out.
9365998	9367599	I'm rocking out to your gay ABBA.
9368799	9369640	It's not my gay ABBA.
9369660	9370561	Yeah, your gay ABBA.
9370901	9371101	It's not.
9374850	9379493	I still say there should be a machine called the ABBA, like an AB machine.
9379974	9383956	Every single time you crunch, it'll play a little bit of Dancing Queen or something.
9385117	9385437	Okay.
9386078	9391081	Or it'll go, like as you crunch it.
9391101	9396325	I think it's about time that we get into the Orange Launch Radio Cage Match.
9396665	9398646	I think we're starting to get into that portion of the show.
9399387	9401368	I'm sure some of you guys are starting to get a little angsty.
9401649	9402149	You guys, this is...
9404059	9405160	Did I say the cage match?
9405180	9406741	I'm sorry, the FU's of the week.
9408563	9409383	It's one of those nights.
9409463	9410464	I don't give a fuck tonight.
9410524	9411044	I really don't.
9413366	9413747	That's alright.
9413767	9415808	We're going to get into the FU's of the week because we're angsty.
9416068	9417590	Maybe we're angsty because of cage match.
9417630	9417950	I don't know.
9418590	9426917	But anyway, DarkSakura isn't here tonight, but usually this is the part of the show where I would say, DarkSakura, why is it we do the FU's of the week every single week?
9427017	9428058	And then what would she say?
9428118	9430580	Something like, because we're angsty?
9430660	9432041	No, she says, ger arg, right?
9442827	9447350	DarkSakura did leave a little message for me on AOL because she was a little bit angsty.
9447410	9451093	She said, had the most retarded field trip for school today.
9451173	9452134	That's my FU.
9452514	9453835	Retarded field trips.
9454796	9456738	I didn't know you got to go on field trips in college.
9456798	9457738	Maybe I should have finished.
9461241	9462422	Loki, what's your FUs of the week?
9466074	9472040	Um, my first FU goes to, um, stupid drivers out there, because you're driving too damn slow, and getting in my way.
9472541	9486996	Um, my other FU goes to my apartment complex for deciding to repave the entire, um, parking lot, and basically rearrange some of the parking spaces and putting in some brand new handicapped ones, because the handicapped people have, like, all these 15 spaces that they can park in,
9487452	9504871	for all the two handicapped people in our complex and they have they put them in some really stupid spots like this one that's in this one spot where the actual ramp to where the handicapped people can go up is like way far away from it and also the fact that there's a giant curb in its way so it's kind of pointless to have a ramp there anyways
9505592	9507514	So, my apartment complex is retarded.
9507814	9512319	And also, fuck you, these stupid kids that keep throwing this tennis ball against the dumpster and playing Butts Up.
9514061	9515382	Dude, I remember Butts Up.
9515422	9516203	That game was awesome.
9516223	9522910	These kids need to go someplace, so I stole their tennis ball, and it's in my house now, but they bought another one, so I have to steal that one, too.
9522930	9523331	You see this?
9523571	9524332	This is mine now.
9524712	9525373	This is mine now.
9526534	9527135	Exactly.
9528016	9528376	Freaking...
9528916	9529516	Stupid people.
9529716	9530097	I hate them.
9530537	9545104	And also, uh, fuck you, the stupid woman that basically, uh, got all pissed off for Nelly having taken out her, um, laundry that had been sitting in one of the washers just unattended because it was already down to its cycle and she's all, WHERE MY CLOTHES AT?
9547185	9548606	And she's like, well, they're in the basket.
9549366	9551327	BETTER NOT BE STEALING MY CLOTHES!
9553299	9556601	And she had her freaking shower cap on and stuff.
9556841	9558722	Total ghetto woman.
9558802	9560603	You should have threatened them with some jellyfish.
9561704	9562884	Where my clothes at?
9562904	9564765	Thank you.
9564845	9565646	I can tell you this much.
9565726	9569688	I'd be handling the situation differently if I was in there.
9570708	9571989	She'd be like, where my clothes at?
9572009	9574130	And I'd be like, talking English, bitch.
9575991	9576551	So, yeah.
9577411	9578472	That's my abuse of the week.
9586616	9588037	I'm relatively angst-free.
9588417	9593799	I got most of my angst out in my live journal earlier this week, because that's what live journals are for, is for memes.
9594159	9596320	I know they're called memes or whatever, but I call them memes.
9597320	9600921	Live journals for memes and me venting once in a while.
9600961	9603482	So I've actually got most of it out of my system, so I feel pretty good.
9604663	9614026	But just an F you to, like, three days this week I ended up staying at work, like, way later than I was originally intending to, and I don't like that.
9615347	9615447	Um...
9616863	9620784	An FU to dumbasses in World of Warcraft, because there's been a couple that kind of pissed me off.
9620804	9624486	An FU to the fact that I haven't gotten onto other servers yet, but I swear I'm going to at some point.
9626446	9631388	And an FU to me having to save money for an Xbox 360, because I don't like being poor.
9631948	9632528	Being poor sucks.
9633929	9635329	That's it.
9635369	9637610	Let's get to Angel and Angel's FUs of the week.
9641158	9642139	Oh, let's see.
9643159	9645680	I'm still kind of pretty pissed off at my computer even though it works now.
9646000	9646780	So, F you to that.
9647140	9652302	Because if it hadn't broken down, I would be level 40 by now.
9652502	9655163	Because, um, yeah.
9655243	9657124	Damn level requirements for guilds.
9657204	9657704	Jesus.
9659385	9661926	Speaking of which, I have to hit level 50 by next Tuesday.
9661966	9664867	So, F you to that too because I don't even know if I'm going to make it.
9666107	9668808	Um, other than that...
9670547	9673128	Oh, yeah, I've been to go to school four days a week now.
9673408	9673628	Ouch.
9674169	9675529	But it must be done.
9675629	9675870	Why?
9675950	9682753	Because then I can get a better job later on or something or whatever you're supposed to do after you go to school.
9682953	9684113	Heh, heh, heh, heh.
9684373	9686054	Okay, that's really it.
9686254	9689036	I'm not really that pissy this week or something.
9690276	9693638	So, um, yeah, until next time.
9695499	9697399	Xtifer, what are your FUs of the week?
9698480	9698540	Um,
9699810	9703217	F you to God, because if you really do exist, you're fucking with my week.
9704339	9706544	I mean, Jesus Christ, God.
9707938	9713720	I am so fucking pissed off because I will be very, very fine and everything.
9714080	9717822	Then I go to the lab and I try to give blood and suddenly I almost faint.
9717862	9719122	You were trying to give blood.
9719242	9721223	I mean, I was trying to get blood work done.
9722103	9729406	And now I have to go back to the lab because I couldn't do enough work and just more stuff that I have to think about doing.
9730346	9731066	So, yeah.
9731586	9732327	So F you to that.
9732747	9733347	F you to just...
9737188	9738488	Last week in general.
9739789	9740229	I don't know.
9741129	9742449	It was just a really difficult week.
9742809	9744930	No, actually, you know, it ended really well.
9745030	9746570	I mean, we had a good night last night.
9747530	9748850	Good partying.
9749951	9751311	Partaking in a partay.
9752611	9753211	It was neat.
9754491	9755452	It was nifty.
9755952	9756852	But otherwise, yeah.
9757912	9762033	Otherwise, F you to everyone who won't listen to my show tomorrow at 7 o'clock.
9764250	9768253	X-O-T-C-M Will you be playing Madonna hung up on your show?
9768313	9771756	I will not be playing that song.
9772436	9778941	You know, I haven't even talked about the Rob Roberts show on Wednesday, which is going to be a big, huge Mondo OLR event.
9779341	9780562	I'm so freaking excited.
9780582	9781663	7 o'clock Wednesday.
9785226	9787027	Let's get to our chatroom FUs.
9789514	9793476	Dark Knight says, F you to work and finding out that I have no car.
9794317	9798119	And of course, F you to gas prices, even though they are starting to go down just a tad.
9800500	9801881	Um, and whoops, where did my music go?
9801901	9805443	My music went away for the, uh... It's because you played that fucking Madonna song.
9805463	9807344	I guess I'll just have to go back to the fucking Madonna song.
9807364	9807744	Sorry, guys.
9810445	9812646	Um, let's see, whatever, uh, the other F yous here.
9812687	9813687	We got Ninst.
9816429	9817109	Oh, whoops, I'm sorry.
9818561	9821123	That was, uh, it was, um, something else for me.
9822344	9827668	Um... Socorina says, F you to me for not voting for the cage match.
9828388	9834733	F you to my parents for being behind me when two hot girls asked me if I wanted to fuck them after clearing max 300 standard.
9837135	9837475	What?
9838356	9839917	That, that doesn't happen.
9841698	9842039	Wow.
9846102	9847603	Misty says, um...
9849674	9851536	Oh, she was giving me a suggestion for FUs.
9851576	9853317	Sorry, I got to them a little late there.
9853877	9858981	NintendoManiac64 says, FU to Loki for commenting on what you did with my foot last night.
9859041	9859942	You and your sick mind.
9861042	9867047	FU to myself for forgetting to put a not before the word commenting in my previous FU, which would make that FU true.
9868118	9870182	F you to Sky for talking during my Skype time.
9870462	9871344	Yeah, get over it.
9871945	9876011	F you to whoever chose the MK64 retro tracks in Mario Kart DS.
9876051	9877494	There's none of the awesome ones.

9880038	9881080	That was like the best track ever.
9886854	9890936	Glutwalk says F you to the coat hanger and the handicapped stall in the bathroom at my workplace.

9945748	9947089	And are they all chain letters?
9947889	9948570	I hate that shit.
9948650	9949030	Me too.
9949250	9952532	That's why I'm kind of glad Myspace exists, because that's where all the chain letters go now.

9990115	9992436	F you to this nagging stuffy nose I've been having these days.
9992896	9996318	One that I'm getting flack from one of my professors since she's saying I'm trying to get her sick.
9998259	10002421	Sephiroth1215 says, F you to Funimation for butchering Dragon Ball Z still.
10002781	10007464	Because even as I play Budokai Tenkashi, it still says...
10009338	10013241	HIFL instead of Hell, and Hercule instead of Mr. Satan.
10013721	10015742	The game is rated teen, you don't need to do that.
10015842	10018284	In fact, you don't even need to do that with an E-rated game.
10021826	10025327	Roz says, F you to old ladies coughing on me for an hour and a half.
10025568	10029470	F you to the health teacher who accused me of plagiarism and then denied it like three days later.
10030828	10033489	What is it about science teachers and assholes, them being assholes?
10033529	10034690	In church, in general.
10034910	10035430	I'm kidding.
10035490	10040232	Ron Chan says, to go along with Loki, a massive F you to people who take clothes out of the laundry machines.
10040312	10041933	No one told you to touch my clothes, okay?
10042213	10044654	You can wait five fucking minutes until I walk back into the laundromat.
10045014	10048496	And on behalf of the chatroom, F you to Socorina for talking smack about Captain Jack.
10052017	10054358	Lego Freak says, F you to every girl.
10054518	10055479	Why don't they like me?
10057967	10064856	and then lastly, Dirty Thief says, F you to my friend who hit me in the crotch with a shoe twice in one day.
10069081	10070082	That sounds pretty hot.
10072165	10072806	You know, though...
10073570	10080093	That is a segment in America's Funniest Home Videos that's so way overdone.
10080873	10083374	They always have those videos of people getting hit in the crotch.
10083834	10084815	And they're not funny.
10085375	10086476	They're not funny.
10087656	10090217	They're totally insanely not funny.
10091078	10093739	You know what I saw on a sale for DVD?
10094059	10097580	It's like freaking America's Funniest Home Videos, like an entire season on DVD.
10097620	10098781	And I was like, why would you buy this?
10098941	10099101	Why?
10099571	10103575	I know, they show it on PAX TV or like all those other channels, TNT.
10103715	10104696	Is it on ABC?
10105758	10106699	I think they still play it.
10106719	10108601	Still hosted by Tom Bergeron now or whatever?
10108921	10109081	Yeah.
10109101	10110302	The guy that was on Hollywood Squares?
10110342	10111363	Better than Bob Saget.
10111383	10112425	Is Hollywood Squares still on?
10113586	10114166	I don't think so.
10114186	10114927	Oh, that's too bad.
10115408	10117009	Whoopi Goldberg was a cool center square.
10117029	10118411	Just thought I'd share.
10118531	10119232	Really like her?
10119892	10120273	Not really.
10120553	10120633	Oh.
10126846	10133024	Anyway, what we're going to do now, I think we'll go to a quick break, and then when we come back, maybe Ask Orange Lounge for a little bit?
10133897	10136539	Ask me anything Ask Orange Lounge Get your questions in now
10163061	10177462	Dreamer Dreamer, take me in your dream Take me anywhere you please Boy, you're making me scream Dreamer Dreamer, life is just a dream If you wanna set me free Boy, you're making me scream Ooh, la-da-dee, la-da-dee
10200755	10212035	Hey, here we go again, turn it up my friend No, we don't stop, we rock the spot No, we don't wait, get ready, all this is it Do you like to dream?
10212075	10214058	Hey, I like to dream, baby
10245370	10250354	And just so you guys know, the only thing better than dream a dream is more dream a dream.
10255818	10260361	Let's dream a dream together.
10262043	10264745	A dream that is real.
10342268	10346150	Orange Lounge Radio, Mamani Music, and more.
10346290	10347971	Pa-pa-pa-perfect!
10354414	10355674	That's Sask Orange Lounge.
10356255	10357355	Some stupid question.
10357875	10361097	What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?
10361577	10368560	I'm curious to see if Extover actually got any questions, but it would be nice if we would stop talking about Madonna for once.
10371448	10373329	That was a laughing riot there.
10373790	10375771	I'm sure everybody just dropped everything they did.
10377392	10381896	Exploding laughter.
10381996	10385498	Rene wants to know, what will it take to get MidiHead on the show?
10386539	10389881	And Sky, Mr. Moripovich would like to know, are you the father?
10392924	10394665	The last time I had sex with a woman.
10396186	10396566	Never mind.
10398227	10398848	It was a kiss.
10399976	10401517	What would it take to get MiniHead on the show?
10401597	10408522	Probably if we just ask really nicely, and we do want to get him on the show sometime around the release time of Ultramix 3, so I look forward to it.
10408602	10409583	I'm sure he'll do it.
10409823	10411525	We just have to ask really nicely, so we will.
10411865	10413966	We'll have our people talk to his people, and we'll let you guys know.
10415087	10416148	Rini also wants to know...
10417463	10421946	Is that promo with Something Something making Captain Jack cry getting retired?
10422567	10423628	Um, we don't know yet.
10424088	10424748	We think so.
10425529	10428831	But we definitely don't want to retire Copy Kills Music, because that thing's awesome.
10429492	10431693	But as far as the promo, you know what?
10431833	10435456	All of our old promos really need to be retired, but we're just too lazy to make new ones.
10435776	10437457	Maybe we should have a promo making contest.
10437477	10438939	Maybe that's how we could get rid of this, uh...
10439824	10440544	DDR Extreme 2.
10440764	10441745	I wonder if people would do it.
10442165	10442505	I didn't know.
10442525	10447086	Chatroom, would you guys make us promos if we gave away an Extreme 2 bundle?
10447846	10449026	An official Konami softpad?
10450587	10451167	That might be cool.
10453167	10454248	Let's get to some more questions.
10459269	10462670	Sakurina wants to know, is 69 easier with a hard-on?
10464787	10465447	I appreciate the question.
10465467	10468269	And yes, my advice would be that you have a hard-on when you do a 69.
10494290	10499935	Legend of Zaku is wondering aloud in a question, are they going to bury Captain Jack in his trademark uniform?
10501276	10502977	You always know there's got to be somebody thinking morbid.
10507422	10509804	If I were Captain Jack, I would want to be buried in the uniform.
10510044	10511285	I think they have to.
10511585	10513907	When was he not in that uniform, honestly?
10514548	10515429	I think they should.
10518618	10521800	I love how everybody gets so mad when people ask me a question.
10522360	10524881	Like I'm gonna, you know, take offense or something.
10525562	10526242	Um, let's see.
10526302	10530645	NintendoManiac64 wants to know, why am I eating cheddar Chex Mix instead of ranch Doritos?
10531185	10532185	Um, because it's less fattening?
10532285	10532586	I don't know.
10533126	10536668	Why are none of the awesome Mario Kart 64 tracks in Mario Kart DS?
10536968	10542151	Um, because Nintendo will release Mario Kart DS Extreme or something that has the extra tracks in it later?
10542211	10543872	Has Mario Kart DS even come out yet?
10544092	10544912	No.
10545453	10547053	How do you know they're not unlockables?
10547334	10547434	Hmm?
10551400	10554822	So, Loki, what did you exactly do with my foot last night?
10554882	10557304	Everyone in chat wants to hear your sick, perverted, gay thoughts.
10558144	10560445	I have no idea what he's... That was like an hour ago on the show.
10560465	10561086	I don't even remember.
10561526	10564088	I wasn't even paying attention then.
10564128	10567770	Well, any of you guys or chatroom folks go to... Beep!
10568110	10569231	Somebody's trying to hoard their website.
10569611	10570491	Once it's complete.
10571312	10573353	Yes, complete it, and then we'll say the website.
10573933	10575054	I haven't even visited yet.
10575114	10576035	I'll visit it.
10577155	10577816	Send me an email.
10577856	10578676	Ask me really nicely.
10578716	10579857	I'll visit it and give you my opinion.
10581587	10584588	Illusion wants to know, now what's it all about, Alfie?
10586129	10588270	Seeing a good movie for a change would be my answer.
10588610	10593051	A movie, yeah, Alfie sucked.
10596053	10597593	It's lame, that's all you need to know.
10599014	10601175	Lego Freak wants to know, hey buddy, can I have $100?
10601215	10601835	Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.
10605211	10611173	One day when we're rich and famous, we'll give away cash and fabulous prizes on the show, and we'll remember your support.
10629315	10634357	Goggle wants to know, after no field trips the past three years, I have two coming up in the next two weeks.
10634757	10640098	Should I go on both and risk missing work, or only go on one and get all my work done?
10640458	10641659	It kind of depends where you're going.
10641699	10643679	Yeah, are you going to the pumpkin patch?
10643739	10645960	Yeah, if you're going to the pumpkin patch, fuck that shit.
10645980	10647621	You don't need to go to the pumpkin patch.
10647921	10653182	But if you're going to, like, I don't know, Hooters, then go.
10653603	10654223	Then go.
10656463	10658264	I mean, if it's to Canada, I would go to Canada.
10659424	10665729	Duran wants to know, I need an NES, can I have yours?
10677543	10678763	My NES is broken.
10679163	10685025	I mean, it won't even play the cartridges after I blow on them like there's no tomorrow.
10686925	10688265	My NES just don't work no more.
10688325	10691886	So if you want a broken paperweight, I guess you could have that.
10694067	10696367	No one ever asks me any questions.
10697348	10699288	Well, you want to give your NES to Duran?
10700439	10705704	No, I actually have the one that top loads, if you remember that one.
10705724	10706324	Oh, lucky you.
10707125	10709367	And I have the original as well.
10710848	10712570	Yes, they work, and no, you can't have them.
10714071	10716193	Otherwise, I can't play Guardian Legends, so there.
10719469	10721490	Goggle wanted to clarify the two field trips.
10721550	10724591	It's a museum on one day and a play on the other.
10725712	10726412	Go to the play.
10727172	10728953	I think both are worth it, and here's why.
10728993	10737136	The museum, you're going to see nudity at the museum, because in classic arts, there's going to be nudity, and in sculptures and stuff, usually there's a naked one or two, like a bust.
10737156	10739397	Artistic nudity is not that great.
10739537	10740238	Yeah, but it's nudity.
10740578	10744161	And then you should see the play, because there's a chance of nudity, depending on what the play is.
10744461	10747583	Like, if it's a little G-rated musical, like The Lion King, forget it.
10747904	10750305	But, you know, if it's something else, like, you know, hair?
10750345	10751406	You don't even need nudity.
10751466	10755269	I mean, if they're wearing tights, you're going to see their package.
10756170	10763916	So, I mean, you know, if you see penal structure behind that, you know, tight that the guy's... Goggle, go where the nudity is.
10764056	10766198	That's my advice, my sound advice to you.
10770394	10771154	All right, that's it.
10771314	10771715	We're done.
10771935	10772695	We're done with this show.
10773696	10774997	Put the nail in the coffin of the show.
10775037	10775337	We're done.
10775657	10778879	I was pretty PG-13 tonight, wouldn't you say so, Rob Roberts?
10778899	10781941	You did a fairly good job, extrovert extroverson.
10785876	10786957	I don't know what else to call you.
10787437	10788798	You don't have a stage last name yet.
10788838	10789378	You need one.
10789718	10790699	It's going to be Extifer.
10791840	10795362	And it's going to be on the show tomorrow.
10796182	10797223	Rob, pitch my show.
10798363	10800084	Listen to the Rob Roberts show on Wednesday.
10800144	10800825	It'll be a good time.
10801025	10801565	Shut the fuck up.
10801945	10802866	Pitch the real show.
10802986	10803506	Shut the fuck up!
10803626	10804186	Shut the fuck up!
10809009	10809549	Final thoughts.
10810690	10811551	Angel, your final thought.
10815171	10817192	I want to go home and play World of Warcraft.
10817812	10818072	Oh!
10819453	10820874	Extra for your final thought.
10820894	10821734	Oh, damn, you didn't say it.
10821754	10822254	Oh, I'm sorry.
10822874	10823375	Oh, addict?
10823495	10825416	Well, that's reserved for Final Fantasy XI.
10825436	10826856	I'll think of another word for World of Warcraft.
10828557	10829457	Extra for your final thought.
10830738	10832859	I want to go home and play World of Warcraft.
10834160	10834780	Oh!
10835820	10837361	But you're already home!
10840803	10843544	He's going to come over to your house, and that will be like the worst thing ever.
10843564	10843604	So...
10845003	10845383	Loki!
10848064	10856447	Um... I hope this works... And... It doesn't work.
10856527	10857087	No, it doesn't.
10857187	10857408	Okay.
10858708	10859288	Son of a bitch.
10859388	10865971	By the way, I'd just like to point out that we've actually been short two hosts tonight, because DarkSakura isn't here, and Loki has just really not been involved in the show.
10865991	10869432	He's been working on something for the site the whole night, so he could care less about this show.
10870260	10872381	I'm participating.
10872581	10875702	Loki does not care about Orange Lounge people.
10878323	10879723	I goddamn hate PHP.
10881004	10881244	Alright.
10882724	10885225	My final thought is I want to top loading NES now.
10885805	10886226	I'm jealous.
10886286	10889027	I can bring mine over and you can play games if you want.
10889047	10889567	Do you have Kid Icarus?
10891894	10892575	It ain't worth it.
10892695	10894055	If you don't have Kid Icarus, it ain't worth it.
10894075	10896797	Magus might, so yes.
10897057	10899478	Why is that game so wonderful?
10899618	10901019	Because it's Kid Icarus, motherfucker.
10901039	10904081	I mean, it was the fucking hardest game that I played when I played it.
10904101	10904281	I beat it.
10904361	10905462	I beat it because I'm the shit.
10906442	10907363	You are the shit.
10908543	10909444	Keep going with that, Rob.
10910284	10914446	But meanwhile, I still think that it was kind of difficult.
10914626	10917268	Maybe it was just because I'm not video game prone or something.
10917288	10917448	Maybe.
10918004	10918524	Maybe that's it.
10919365	10920765	I beat Legend of Zelda.
10921466	10921826	Good job.
10922186	10923047	Oh, no problem.
10923067	10924627	Did you beat the second quest, though?
10924928	10925408	I did.
10925948	10926448	I did beat it.
10926468	10926648	Good job.
10926689	10927549	Did you beat Zelda 2?
10928489	10929810	I didn't.
10930150	10931071	You suck!
10931571	10932031	I know.
10933572	10934753	Final word of the show.
10934953	10936494	One word to sum it all up.
10936774	10937374	Rob Roberts?
10937634	10937814	No.
10938795	10939955	Oh, do I get to give the final word?
10939975	10941356	I believe you do, because you never do.
10941376	10943577	I never do do the final word of the show.
10943597	10944978	Goddammit, do the final word of the show.
