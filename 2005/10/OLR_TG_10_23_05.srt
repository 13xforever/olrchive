00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,832
[SPEAKER_01]: Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, week of October 24th, 2005.

4
00:00:19,407 --> 00:00:28,034
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, everybody out there in iTunes or iPod or whatever you're using to download our podcast, maybe one of those websites out there.

5
00:00:29,241 --> 00:00:31,703
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

6
00:00:52,656 --> 00:00:54,117
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, our webpage.

7
00:00:54,217 --> 00:00:56,878
[SPEAKER_01]: OrangeLaundry.com or the OLRPSP site?

8
00:00:57,178 --> 00:00:57,998
[SPEAKER_00]: OLRPSP.

9
00:00:58,578 --> 00:01:02,559
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is I don't know how to program in said languages that I'm programming in.

10
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:05,180
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah, it's a little difficult.

11
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,561
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of a learning experience.

12
00:01:06,641 --> 00:01:09,162
[SPEAKER_01]: You must be trying to cook up some cool stuff for the site.

13
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:09,742
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.

14
00:01:09,902 --> 00:01:10,202
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

15
00:01:10,322 --> 00:01:10,722
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds good.

16
00:01:10,782 --> 00:01:11,242
[SPEAKER_01]: Check that out.

17
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:12,643
[SPEAKER_01]: OLRPSP.com.

18
00:01:12,663 --> 00:01:13,523
[SPEAKER_01]: It's our new site.

19
00:01:14,164 --> 00:01:15,224
[SPEAKER_01]: Just for the PSPs.

20
00:01:15,244 --> 00:01:21,087
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you can bring it up on like Internet Explorer or Firefox, but seriously, it's really made for your PSP.

21
00:01:21,107 --> 00:01:22,607
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks so much better on a PSP.

22
00:01:23,088 --> 00:01:25,228
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you bring it up in Firefox, you're going to go, what the heck?

23
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:25,849
[SPEAKER_01]: This doesn't look right.

24
00:01:27,669 --> 00:01:28,830
[SPEAKER_01]: But on a PSP, it looks great.

25
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:30,330
[SPEAKER_01]: High def and everything.

26
00:01:30,371 --> 00:01:30,751
[SPEAKER_01]: It's awesome.

27
00:01:30,791 --> 00:01:35,473
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're working on something that's kind of with the theme of the normal station that is, you know...

28
00:01:37,273 --> 00:01:44,215
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting our listeners to basically give us feedback and just a whole way of connecting with our listeners.

29
00:01:44,555 --> 00:01:45,015
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.

30
00:01:45,415 --> 00:01:51,076
[SPEAKER_01]: So actually, we also have the Orange Lounge Radio message line, which just opened up on our website for our live show.

31
00:01:51,156 --> 00:01:53,137
[SPEAKER_01]: So we might be using that in our podcast as well.

32
00:01:53,257 --> 00:01:59,938
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's more interactivity to make this a little bit your show as well, because we appreciate you guys tuning in and taking the time to listen.

33
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:01,819
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just Loki and I tonight.

34
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:03,839
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody else wanted to come.

35
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:06,020
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody else wanted to be on the podcast.

36
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:06,720
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's cool.

37
00:02:07,728 --> 00:02:10,110
[SPEAKER_01]: We got a little bit of news to talk about tonight.

38
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:15,954
[SPEAKER_01]: But first, we always talk about how our gaming week was, what we've been playing, and what's new in our gaming world.

39
00:02:15,974 --> 00:02:16,574
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you know what?

40
00:02:16,594 --> 00:02:17,335
[SPEAKER_01]: We're geeks too.

41
00:02:17,715 --> 00:02:18,576
[SPEAKER_01]: Loki, what have you been playing?

42
00:02:19,481 --> 00:02:21,702
[SPEAKER_00]: I have been playing a couple things.

43
00:02:21,882 --> 00:02:26,025
[SPEAKER_00]: First, I started off with Burnout because I had to get the rest of Burnout out of my system.

44
00:02:26,765 --> 00:02:30,567
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I've got my new baby, and that would be The Warriors.

45
00:02:31,167 --> 00:02:31,788
[SPEAKER_01]: The Warriors?

46
00:02:31,888 --> 00:02:32,748
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never even heard of this.

47
00:02:32,788 --> 00:02:33,308
[SPEAKER_01]: What's this about?

48
00:02:33,568 --> 00:02:37,430
[SPEAKER_00]: The Warriors is a game based on the 1979 movie starring Michael Beck.

49
00:02:37,831 --> 00:02:40,552
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically about the gangs of New York.

50
00:02:42,053 --> 00:02:44,254
[SPEAKER_01]: Not like the Martin Scorsese gangs in New York?

51
00:02:44,314 --> 00:02:45,094
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no.

52
00:02:45,354 --> 00:02:46,795
[SPEAKER_00]: This is about gangs during 1979.

53
00:02:46,835 --> 00:02:46,935
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

54
00:02:48,732 --> 00:02:54,173
[SPEAKER_00]: Think really cheesy themed gangs like you have a gang called the Baseball Furies that are dressed up like baseball players.

55
00:02:54,193 --> 00:02:57,274
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a gang of like mime looking people.

56
00:02:57,314 --> 00:02:59,154
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're a jet, you know you're a jet.

57
00:02:59,194 --> 00:03:00,374
[SPEAKER_00]: Seriously, it's like that.

58
00:03:00,695 --> 00:03:03,975
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very similar to that, but it's just so cheesy and cool.

59
00:03:04,415 --> 00:03:05,335
[SPEAKER_00]: The game is really awesome.

60
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:09,836
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like a Final Fight type game where you just beat up everything, but they actually have a story to it.

61
00:03:09,896 --> 00:03:17,318
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually takes place three months before the events of the movie, then the very end of the game goes through the events of the movie, because basically the story of the movie is that

62
00:03:17,873 --> 00:03:25,740
[SPEAKER_00]: There's this one guy who's calling all these gangs together to unite them because they outnumber the police and are basically going to take over New York.

63
00:03:26,661 --> 00:03:38,973
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this other gang frames the warriors and they kill the guy, and so now everybody's out to kill you, and so you have to get back to your home turf of Coney Island before you get beaten to death.

64
00:03:39,301 --> 00:03:40,002
[SPEAKER_01]: Xbox Live on Xbox?

65
00:03:40,042 --> 00:03:40,122
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

66
00:03:40,142 --> 00:03:41,102
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, bummer.

67
00:03:41,142 --> 00:03:42,924
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but it's really awesome.

68
00:04:03,226 --> 00:04:07,711
[SPEAKER_00]: and then this next week in a few days here I'll be picking up Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories.

69
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:08,732
[SPEAKER_01]: That's coming out very soon.

70
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,834
[SPEAKER_00]: Which I'm very excited about that one.

71
00:04:11,014 --> 00:04:15,079
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of Xbox, did you know Xbox Live is going to be, I know not that you care because you don't really play Xbox Live, right?

72
00:04:15,099 --> 00:04:15,779
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have an Xbox.

73
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,422
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I thought you got one finally.

74
00:04:18,723 --> 00:04:20,264
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, but you're going to be getting a 360, right?

75
00:04:20,284 --> 00:04:20,544
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

76
00:04:20,965 --> 00:04:23,788
[SPEAKER_01]: So are you going to buy any old Xbox games to kind of catch up on what you missed?

77
00:04:25,075 --> 00:04:26,035
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

78
00:04:47,759 --> 00:05:16,398
[SPEAKER_01]: and so I guess you know I was kind of trying to look into and during our three hour show earlier this week we were kind of talking to some of our listeners trying to get feedback on how the new Xbox 360 what their thoughts are on it and it sounds like you're going to be actually able to change your gamer tag whenever you want on the new 360 it's tied to your passport you know the whole Microsoft passport thing they're integrating that into the 360 it sounds like so that's kind of what we're hearing well that's cool at least in that way you can have a gamer tag you know that other people might have and

79
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:17,738
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

80
00:05:17,898 --> 00:05:18,379
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be interesting.

81
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:18,979
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, maybe.

82
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:23,783
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't know if we can duplicate names still, but... As long as I can keep my old one, I guess that's okay.

83
00:05:24,103 --> 00:05:24,323
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

84
00:05:24,343 --> 00:05:25,404
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

85
00:05:25,424 --> 00:05:28,727
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though I don't... There's better names I would have liked, but oh well.

86
00:05:29,827 --> 00:05:31,829
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, anything else you've been playing in your game week?

87
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:32,810
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?

88
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:33,210
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

89
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:39,595
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been just trying to play some of... I'm trying to... I have Shadow of Colossus, but I haven't gotten a chance to play it yet.

90
00:05:40,155 --> 00:05:43,778
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I want to check that one out and maybe Tony Hawk's American Wasteland.

91
00:05:44,238 --> 00:05:46,280
[SPEAKER_00]: But I haven't gotten a chance to play him yet.

92
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:47,810
[SPEAKER_01]: Real life?

93
00:05:49,134 --> 00:05:52,344
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, real life and just web page crap.

94
00:05:52,624 --> 00:05:53,146
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, all right.

95
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:57,161
[SPEAKER_01]: My gaming week actually has been pretty mellow.

96
00:05:57,301 --> 00:06:00,802
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been mostly World of Warcraft, which I talked about on last week's show.

97
00:06:00,842 --> 00:06:03,462
[SPEAKER_01]: I went out and got it, and it was this big, oh, Rob got World of Warcraft.

98
00:06:03,803 --> 00:06:07,303
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've been playing it, and I've been giving it a fair chance and kind of checking it out, seeing what I think of it.

99
00:06:07,744 --> 00:06:10,564
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, I actually kind of like it.

100
00:06:10,824 --> 00:06:20,967
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot better than I thought it would be, because you know, remember guys, I played Final Fantasy XI for like two years, so of course I hear nothing but smack talking about World of Warcraft, but one thing I'm learning about

101
00:06:21,789 --> 00:06:28,733
[SPEAKER_01]: The MMOs as I'm playing World of Warcraft is, it really is just a much different game than Final Fantasy XI.

102
00:06:28,773 --> 00:06:34,556
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very different and it has a whole lot of different things to offer and it's not necessarily better or worse.

103
00:06:34,657 --> 00:06:42,221
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just that even though World of Warcraft and Final Fantasy XI and let's take some of the other big ones too, Guild Wars and Ragnarok.

104
00:06:42,659 --> 00:06:43,439
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

105
00:07:03,445 --> 00:07:06,647
[SPEAKER_01]: because Guild Wars is practically set up so that you don't even have to ever play with anybody.

106
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:09,068
[SPEAKER_01]: And you don't play a monthly fee with Guild Wars.

107
00:07:09,648 --> 00:07:20,614
[SPEAKER_01]: Not that I think Guild Wars is necessarily the strongest game, nor is it my favorite out of the three, but I think it's probably the most accessible and most non-shocking.

108
00:07:21,415 --> 00:07:25,617
[SPEAKER_01]: The game is kind of set up very similar to a single-player experience, if you want it to be.

109
00:07:26,777 --> 00:07:29,459
[SPEAKER_01]: But as far as Final Fantasy XI and World of Warcraft, I'm just noticing...

110
00:07:29,915 --> 00:07:30,835
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

111
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:56,843
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, if you're looking for a game that you want to do, like, some, you know, role-playing, or you just want to, you know, do quests and big things with friends and stuff, I think Final Fantasy is probably the more social game.

112
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:59,784
[SPEAKER_01]: But World of Warcraft has its own strengths as well.

113
00:07:59,804 --> 00:08:07,806
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's a lot of things that make World of Warcraft a little less tedious of a game to be playing sometimes, because seriously, Final Fantasy XI feels like a second job sometimes.

114
00:08:08,186 --> 00:08:10,867
[SPEAKER_01]: It can get that intricate, and World of Warcraft doesn't feel that way at all.

115
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:13,168
[SPEAKER_01]: World of Warcraft is a little more, you know, relaxed.

116
00:08:13,388 --> 00:08:16,089
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm just kind of learning about all the differences between the game, but I think all in all,

117
00:08:16,894 --> 00:08:29,135
[SPEAKER_01]: I like World of Warcraft and I would recommend it if you are I mean obviously probably most of you guys already have it I'm really a late bloomer when it comes to this game just because I've been focused on one MMO for so long um

118
00:08:30,447 --> 00:08:34,930
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you have an interest in the game and you think it sounds like something you'd like, check it out.

119
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:39,493
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you'll find it's really different than the other MMOs out there, except for Guild Wars.

120
00:08:39,513 --> 00:08:41,695
[SPEAKER_01]: Because Guild Wars and World of Warcraft have a lot in common.

121
00:08:41,715 --> 00:08:42,215
[SPEAKER_01]: They really do.

122
00:08:42,895 --> 00:08:44,316
[SPEAKER_01]: Just in the game, the way it plays.

123
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:46,178
[SPEAKER_01]: To me, it feels very similar.

124
00:08:46,498 --> 00:08:50,961
[SPEAKER_01]: I think World of Warcraft has a lot more than Guild Wars.

125
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:52,522
[SPEAKER_01]: About 40 more levels, for one.

126
00:08:53,082 --> 00:08:56,485
[SPEAKER_01]: And more crafting and stuff you can do that I think makes it a little more...

127
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:01,253
[SPEAKER_01]: A little longer gameplay than Guild Wars would be.

128
00:09:01,613 --> 00:09:04,275
[SPEAKER_00]: Still haven't played Final Fantasy yet, again.

129
00:09:04,956 --> 00:09:08,719
[SPEAKER_00]: Still waiting for that time to come in, but it's not there.

130
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:12,122
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I'm just on a cool-off period from Final Fantasy XI for a little while myself.

131
00:09:12,182 --> 00:09:13,804
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to just take a step back.

132
00:09:14,605 --> 00:09:23,873
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not saying I dislike the game at all, I still think it's an awesome game, and I love it a lot, and I'll probably get back into it once the 360 and Treasures of Adorgan expansions kind of,

133
00:09:24,676 --> 00:09:25,057
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't

134
00:09:42,384 --> 00:09:43,004
[SPEAKER_00]: No, if it is.

135
00:09:43,204 --> 00:09:44,245
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if it is.

136
00:09:44,265 --> 00:09:52,767
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, I heard it's not going to support the voice chat, because the voice chat's going to be unmoderated, which doesn't make sense to me, because... Oh, I wouldn't want voice chat anyways.

137
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:56,728
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine Final Fantasy XI voice chat.

138
00:09:56,768 --> 00:09:57,248
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done it.

139
00:09:57,768 --> 00:09:59,209
[SPEAKER_00]: TeamSpeak.

140
00:09:59,549 --> 00:10:01,029
[SPEAKER_00]: Or Ventrilo, or one of those things.

141
00:10:01,349 --> 00:10:02,530
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but, okay.

142
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:06,891
[SPEAKER_00]: That works fine when you have a group of people, but what if you have the world?

143
00:10:07,051 --> 00:10:07,891
[SPEAKER_00]: No, thank you.

144
00:10:07,951 --> 00:10:08,651
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I gotcha.

145
00:10:08,952 --> 00:10:09,952
[SPEAKER_00]: But, no, the whole thing is...

146
00:10:11,055 --> 00:10:17,640
[SPEAKER_00]: I just hope it's supported, period, because then that way I can cancel my PlayOnLive account and just move it all over to the Xbox Live.

147
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:21,703
[SPEAKER_01]: I have this feeling it's going to be set up like PSO where you have to pay for both, and that's going to be sad.

148
00:10:22,264 --> 00:10:28,068
[SPEAKER_01]: Because with Phantasy Star Online on Xbox, you have to pay not just the Xbox Live, but then you pay the Sega fee of like $8 as well.

149
00:10:28,569 --> 00:10:28,889
[SPEAKER_01]: Sucks.

150
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,411
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, still, they're going to have a break, I'm sure.

151
00:10:31,431 --> 00:10:32,332
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we'll see.

152
00:10:33,052 --> 00:10:33,933
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope so, I hope so.

153
00:10:35,229 --> 00:10:39,592
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's get into some gaming news tonight, talk about some things going on in the gaming world.

154
00:10:40,112 --> 00:10:47,718
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of the Xbox 360, Walmart and EB Games and some other stores are starting to get the little Xbox 360 kiosks.

155
00:10:48,378 --> 00:10:55,803
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't seen any show up, but there's some websites set up that you can just go on to some of the major gaming portals.

156
00:10:55,823 --> 00:10:57,104
[SPEAKER_01]: You can probably find some websites.

157
00:10:57,424 --> 00:11:00,366
[SPEAKER_01]: that have these lists set up of where all these gaming kiosks are.

158
00:11:00,386 --> 00:11:00,946
[SPEAKER_00]: They have lists.

159
00:11:00,966 --> 00:11:03,828
[SPEAKER_00]: They even have a Google Map thing that's set up for it.

160
00:11:03,948 --> 00:11:06,970
[SPEAKER_01]: But honestly, chances are it's going to be in the mall near you at some point.

161
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:07,490
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me put it this way.

162
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:11,473
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to be rolled out to almost every store in over three weeks.

163
00:11:11,553 --> 00:11:12,913
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they're shipping them out right now.

164
00:11:12,993 --> 00:11:15,315
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, obviously Microsoft's pushing this thing like crazy.

165
00:11:15,475 --> 00:11:17,056
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be in your local store soon enough.

166
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:20,458
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you just have to be first, get on the Internet and look.

167
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,823
[SPEAKER_00]: I checked our local Walmart today because I just happened to be there, and no, they didn't have them.

168
00:11:25,023 --> 00:11:26,584
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a big Walmart fan myself.

169
00:11:26,924 --> 00:11:35,350
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm more of a Target guy, so... Yeah, it's only a couple demos, and honestly, this is coming out in a few weeks anyways.

170
00:11:35,651 --> 00:11:36,151
[SPEAKER_00]: I can wait.

171
00:11:36,502 --> 00:11:36,982
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, I know.

172
00:11:37,022 --> 00:11:37,823
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of where I'm at, too.

173
00:11:37,843 --> 00:11:38,423
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, you know what?

174
00:11:38,443 --> 00:11:43,125
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just wait and have my own, and then I'll have to stand in line, and I'll have little kids looking over my shoulder.

175
00:11:43,365 --> 00:11:49,228
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what really annoys me, when little kids are looking over my shoulder, like if I am in a place like Walmart or Target playing one of those, and the little kids are looking over my shoulder.

176
00:11:49,628 --> 00:11:50,309
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you doing?

177
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:51,089
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you do that?

178
00:11:51,189 --> 00:11:51,629
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you do that?

179
00:11:51,649 --> 00:11:52,209
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you do that?

180
00:11:52,409 --> 00:11:53,250
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you do that?

181
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:54,010
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you do that?

182
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:54,711
[SPEAKER_01]: What's that?

183
00:11:54,851 --> 00:11:55,251
[SPEAKER_01]: What's that?

184
00:11:55,771 --> 00:11:56,451
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you going to get this?

185
00:11:56,631 --> 00:11:57,272
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you going to buy this?

186
00:11:58,132 --> 00:11:58,953
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, I might buy this.

187
00:11:58,973 --> 00:12:03,095
[SPEAKER_01]: Not that it's going to do you a damn bit of good, but kids are funny.

188
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:06,871
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go to another system.

189
00:12:06,891 --> 00:12:10,472
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk a little bit about the PSP, which has shipped 10 million units.

190
00:12:10,592 --> 00:12:17,115
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what officials from Sony are announcing, that they have reached 10 million units, of course, this being worldwide.

191
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:26,778
[SPEAKER_01]: 183 PSP software titles currently out, a total of 19.6 million units of software shipped, and then 15 million UMD movies.

192
00:12:26,838 --> 00:12:31,480
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of crazy, because that means almost just as many UMD movies have shipped as games.

193
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,181
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know what's also crazy about it?

194
00:12:33,401 --> 00:12:33,861
[SPEAKER_01]: If 10 million...

195
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:40,983
[SPEAKER_01]: PSPs have shipped, then that means like most people only own like one game.

196
00:12:43,124 --> 00:12:44,164
[SPEAKER_01]: And probably it's Luminous.

197
00:12:44,384 --> 00:12:45,405
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably one or two games.

198
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:46,565
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably Luminous.

199
00:12:47,145 --> 00:12:47,665
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of them.

200
00:12:48,486 --> 00:12:49,186
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I don't know.

201
00:12:49,606 --> 00:12:50,807
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody I know, it's Luminous.

202
00:12:51,007 --> 00:12:52,687
[SPEAKER_01]: And honestly, it is the best PSP game out there.

203
00:12:52,887 --> 00:12:55,128
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm probably just not impressed with the games though right now like I am.

204
00:12:55,188 --> 00:12:57,249
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's just... I haven't bought it.

205
00:12:57,709 --> 00:12:57,889
[SPEAKER_00]: I had...

206
00:12:58,908 --> 00:13:02,230
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even remember the last PSP game I bought, other than Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories.

207
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:10,694
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything I've gotten has been passed down free from publishers, and I wouldn't have even bought them if they hadn't given it to me, because I'm just unimpressed by everything that's coming out.

208
00:13:10,715 --> 00:13:14,397
[SPEAKER_01]: There just hasn't really been a title that's been like, I have to really get that.

209
00:13:14,417 --> 00:13:16,438
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm kind of seeing that in the new Katamari PSP.

210
00:13:16,478 --> 00:13:19,019
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, oh, I definitely want to get that, because I'm in the Katamari franchise.

211
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:19,479
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm into that.

212
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:24,282
[SPEAKER_01]: But we have yet to see a really solid franchise game hit the PSP.

213
00:13:24,322 --> 00:13:26,083
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, granted, we've had Burnout and

214
00:13:26,443 --> 00:13:31,306
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had Wipeout, I guess, and we've had Metal Gear, but not really the same Metal Gear.

215
00:13:32,107 --> 00:13:38,191
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had some extent the franchises, but we've really just had no solid franchise title hit the PSP.

216
00:13:38,271 --> 00:13:38,731
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?

217
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:40,092
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's kind of what's hurting it.

218
00:13:40,312 --> 00:13:45,716
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas on the DS, now you're getting Castlevania, and it's seriously probably the best Castlevania game they've done since Symphony of the Night.

219
00:13:46,256 --> 00:13:50,259
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, it's like DS is starting to look really good with the franchises.

220
00:13:50,419 --> 00:13:50,939
[SPEAKER_01]: Mario Kart?

221
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:53,501
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Mario Kart on the way, and Animal Crossing.

222
00:13:53,601 --> 00:13:55,823
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole internet connectivity stuff.

223
00:13:56,721 --> 00:13:58,923
[SPEAKER_01]: So, PSP needs to pick up the pace.

224
00:13:58,983 --> 00:13:59,603
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see what happens.

225
00:14:00,504 --> 00:14:02,605
[SPEAKER_01]: I know PSP's got its loyalists out there, though.

226
00:14:03,746 --> 00:14:08,870
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have any emails, comments, or suggestions, you know I send us an email to go at orangelaunchradio.com.

227
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:11,792
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you're a PSP lover wanting to yell at us a little bit.

228
00:14:12,072 --> 00:14:13,133
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't dislike the PSP.

229
00:14:13,393 --> 00:14:16,855
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the PSP's a great multi-system, like getting to watch them.

230
00:14:16,895 --> 00:14:18,636
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, that's really what their marketing is.

231
00:14:18,697 --> 00:14:21,438
[SPEAKER_01]: So, on that end, it's successful that you can watch movies.

232
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:22,279
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not talking about PSP, either.

233
00:14:22,299 --> 00:14:23,880
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've got two of them.

234
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:26,282
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, obviously, I love them, but just...

235
00:14:26,902 --> 00:14:52,665
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the fact that it's got the wireless internet now and you can download our show on it so it's great for that but the games element alone little weak it's just you know when you see a game like Twisted Metal you're thinking ooh Twisted Metal Black that was an awesome game oh wait this is a port of Twisted Metal 2 a Playstation game oh crap Twisted Metal for the PS3 I know there's gonna be one that's gonna be awesome

236
00:14:53,812 --> 00:15:00,378
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, about the email box, DarkSakura is our mailbox queen, but she's not here tonight, unfortunately, so we're going to go ahead and table mailbox until next week.

237
00:15:00,938 --> 00:15:03,721
[SPEAKER_01]: But definitely get your emails in to go at orange launch radio dot com.

238
00:15:04,568 --> 00:15:12,870
[SPEAKER_01]: I was talking a little bit about World of Warcraft earlier, and you know there's an expansion on the horizon, and of course people love to gossip about the expansion packs.

239
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:15,430
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the latest rumors circulating around the internet.

240
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:19,031
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know how true they are, but they seem to be pretty solid leads.

241
00:15:19,771 --> 00:15:24,753
[SPEAKER_01]: The Burning Crusade, sounds like it's going to be the name of it, and it's going to take place in the Outlands.

242
00:15:24,993 --> 00:15:27,313
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to raise the level cap with this expansion to 70.

243
00:15:27,433 --> 00:15:28,573
[SPEAKER_01]: Some sites are saying 75, but most are saying 70.

244
00:15:31,578 --> 00:15:32,098
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

245
00:15:55,684 --> 00:15:59,186
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe next year, because I'm just now getting into World of Warcraft, so maybe next year I'll be ready for BlizzCon.

246
00:16:00,367 --> 00:16:05,190
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, they might do some small upgrades to the graphic engine as well, and they're going to add weather effects, which I think is neat.

247
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:08,712
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the other thing I think is neat, cross-server battlegrounds.

248
00:16:09,653 --> 00:16:10,013
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll see.

249
00:16:10,413 --> 00:16:24,782
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I actually, I was reading, because I was reading an article about this earlier, and they were talking about some of the stuff that they're going to be having, and I could have sworn they actually did name the... Yeah, for Alliance, it's this...

250
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:27,541
[SPEAKER_00]: Tra-nai or something like that.

251
00:16:27,722 --> 00:16:31,885
[SPEAKER_00]: It's D-R-A-E-N-E-I is the race for the alliance.

252
00:16:32,225 --> 00:16:34,207
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a new class, I guess, Spellbreaker.

253
00:16:35,267 --> 00:16:38,510
[SPEAKER_00]: They're rumored saying it's going to be race 275.

254
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:42,853
[SPEAKER_00]: Six new areas and nine new high-end instances.

255
00:16:42,953 --> 00:16:47,257
[SPEAKER_01]: So it really just depends on what website you're looking at because everybody's reporting something different at this point.

256
00:16:47,277 --> 00:16:50,039
[SPEAKER_01]: But it seems like, okay, there's going to be a level cap raise.

257
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:51,460
[SPEAKER_01]: Some little things it looks like.

258
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:52,101
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.

259
00:16:52,161 --> 00:16:52,281
[SPEAKER_01]: But...

260
00:16:54,022 --> 00:16:57,404
[SPEAKER_01]: You know the other big rumor going around about World of Warcraft right now is that it's going to go on the 360.

261
00:16:58,984 --> 00:17:07,968
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm certain Microsoft is really, really hoping for that, because let's face it, World of Warcraft right now is a PC-only title, and not everybody who's into consoles is into PC.

262
00:17:08,128 --> 00:17:08,729
[SPEAKER_01]: I like both.

263
00:17:09,449 --> 00:17:14,071
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, with Civilization IV coming out this week, this is going to be a big month for PC gaming for me.

264
00:17:14,611 --> 00:17:19,273
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, there's folks that don't really cross those lines.

265
00:17:19,293 --> 00:17:22,775
[SPEAKER_01]: They're a PC gamer or they're a console gamer.

266
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:27,703
[SPEAKER_01]: So if World of Warcraft came out on the 360 or any next-gen console, really, that would be huge.

267
00:17:29,104 --> 00:17:30,065
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to see it happen.

268
00:17:30,085 --> 00:17:32,487
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it would be good news, but who knows.

269
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:41,513
[SPEAKER_01]: So surely you've been following the drama, and I'm sure anybody who listens to this show probably has been following this too, so I don't want to beat a dead horse with this.

270
00:17:42,325 --> 00:17:44,428
[SPEAKER_01]: Penny Arcade vs. Jack Thompson

271
00:17:57,665 --> 00:18:04,987
[SPEAKER_01]: Penny Arcade donated $10,000 because Jack Thompson was like, ha ha, just kidding about the mod thing.

272
00:18:05,027 --> 00:18:08,629
[SPEAKER_01]: He said he was going to give $10,000 to whoever did it and then he said it was a joke.

273
00:18:08,949 --> 00:18:12,430
[SPEAKER_01]: And Penny Arcade put up the $10,000 because Jack Thompson wouldn't do it.

274
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:18,372
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Jack Thompson basically wrote a letter to the police saying that the Penny Arcade people are harassing him.

275
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:25,374
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the Penny Arcade people filed something with a legal association to get Jack Thompson investigated.

276
00:18:25,822 --> 00:18:28,643
[SPEAKER_00]: No, what they were doing is they were actually, they sent a letter.

277
00:18:28,823 --> 00:18:30,644
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm completely paraphrasing here.

278
00:18:31,305 --> 00:18:34,626
[SPEAKER_00]: They sent letters to the Florida bar, basically.

279
00:18:34,966 --> 00:18:41,890
[SPEAKER_01]: So Jack Thompson now turns around and files a complaint with the feds and the district attorney, and the rumor is he was calling for a truce.

280
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:54,696
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, he's all over the place, and he's emailing the feds and stuff like this, and all his information, I mean, if anybody actually instead of, because anybody's going to do research on this and be like, oh, my God, you know.

281
00:18:56,058 --> 00:18:59,081
[SPEAKER_00]: He's completely nuts because everything he's stating is completely wrong.

282
00:18:59,161 --> 00:19:08,610
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, anybody who does any research on this and doesn't take him for, you know, face value is obviously going to see... He's good at getting publicity, though, because even we're talking about him.

283
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:10,251
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe we shouldn't be, I don't know.

284
00:19:10,711 --> 00:19:13,034
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's just, we've got to point out that he's stupid.

285
00:19:13,074 --> 00:19:14,275
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I like doing.

286
00:19:14,315 --> 00:19:16,877
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to point out the retarded people.

287
00:19:19,319 --> 00:19:19,880
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate to say this.

288
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:26,975
[SPEAKER_00]: There seems to be a lot of politicians coming from Florida that are just retarded.

289
00:19:27,015 --> 00:19:30,916
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's not go there because we don't want to get more hate mail from our friends in Florida.

290
00:19:31,576 --> 00:19:32,237
[SPEAKER_00]: Politicians!

291
00:19:32,457 --> 00:19:33,617
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, just politicians.

292
00:19:33,877 --> 00:19:34,377
[SPEAKER_00]: Florida's cool.

293
00:19:36,057 --> 00:19:42,819
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, if I could offer words of advice to Penny Arcade, finish him.

294
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:47,820
[SPEAKER_00]: Just honestly...

295
00:19:48,672 --> 00:19:50,874
[SPEAKER_00]: Just let him dig himself his own grave.

296
00:19:50,934 --> 00:19:52,515
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, because it's going to happen.

297
00:19:52,575 --> 00:19:55,917
[SPEAKER_00]: He's just going to eventually get caught up in so many lies.

298
00:19:57,238 --> 00:19:58,399
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he'll be over.

299
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:00,781
[SPEAKER_01]: I have just a small little story on Civilization 4.

300
00:20:01,321 --> 00:20:03,123
[SPEAKER_01]: It's coming out this week, October 25th.

301
00:20:03,203 --> 00:20:05,324
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to buy this and check it out.

302
00:20:05,344 --> 00:20:07,426
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I didn't... I loved Civilization 1.

303
00:20:07,806 --> 00:20:08,587
[SPEAKER_01]: Loved Civilization 1.

304
00:20:08,727 --> 00:20:15,432
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I've gone off on a previous podcast about how I think it's probably one of my favorite games of all time, if not my favorite game of all time, is Civilization 1.

305
00:20:15,852 --> 00:20:17,053
[SPEAKER_01]: But I never really got into 2 or 3.

306
00:20:17,454 --> 00:20:18,014
[SPEAKER_01]: It just didn't...

307
00:20:18,382 --> 00:20:22,244
[SPEAKER_01]: have that simpleness, that accessibility of Civilization 1.

308
00:20:23,425 --> 00:20:26,787
[SPEAKER_01]: But Civ 4 is on the horizon, and I'm just excited to at least check it out and see if I like it.

309
00:20:26,807 --> 00:20:31,869
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hear it's going to be really customizable and all this stuff, so it's coming out this week, and I'm curious about it.

310
00:20:31,969 --> 00:20:41,134
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely... I wish I could rent PC games or something, because I don't want to have to spend $49.99 on it, but it looks like I'm going to have to, so we'll see.

311
00:20:41,935 --> 00:20:44,076
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, I'm like... Oh well, we'll see.

312
00:20:45,237 --> 00:20:46,737
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, Loki, what do you have for us tonight?

313
00:20:46,757 --> 00:20:47,838
[SPEAKER_01]: You got some news stories for us?

314
00:20:48,149 --> 00:20:48,850
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

315
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:11,103
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't understand the lure of buying games before the system is out anyway.

316
00:21:11,183 --> 00:21:12,984
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I'm going to go home and look at the pretty packaging in the book.

317
00:21:13,364 --> 00:21:16,466
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it just to make the lines go faster when the system comes out?

318
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:17,267
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

319
00:21:17,327 --> 00:21:17,807
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't get it.

320
00:21:17,827 --> 00:21:18,367
[SPEAKER_00]: I think so.

321
00:21:19,308 --> 00:21:22,010
[SPEAKER_00]: Or just so there's not a huge rush on everything.

322
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:24,431
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting my games before they come out just because...

323
00:21:26,658 --> 00:21:28,759
[SPEAKER_00]: Just pick everything up when I get it.

324
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:30,440
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll have the system.

325
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,520
[SPEAKER_01]: And you guys know I didn't reserve my system.

326
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,561
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to be playing the Rush the Crowds game.

327
00:21:36,522 --> 00:21:39,523
[SPEAKER_01]: I did it with the DS and I did it with other systems in the past.

328
00:21:39,563 --> 00:21:41,584
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll do it with the Xbox 360 as well.

329
00:21:41,784 --> 00:21:46,005
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole rumor is that they've been playing up the fact that they're oversold on it.

330
00:21:46,045 --> 00:21:46,885
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shock!

331
00:21:47,026 --> 00:21:49,226
[SPEAKER_01]: Every company says they're oversold when their systems come out.

332
00:21:49,246 --> 00:21:53,568
[SPEAKER_00]: They're saying that that was artificial to increase demand on the system or something like that.

333
00:21:53,668 --> 00:21:53,808
[SPEAKER_00]: But

334
00:21:54,963 --> 00:21:58,405
[SPEAKER_01]: What was that countdown thing you were blogging about earlier this week?

335
00:21:58,425 --> 00:22:00,887
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a countdown on the Xbox 360?

336
00:22:01,047 --> 00:22:01,227
[SPEAKER_00]: Hex 168.

337
00:22:01,747 --> 00:22:03,308
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you talked about it last podcast.

338
00:22:03,628 --> 00:22:09,392
[SPEAKER_00]: Hex 168 is actually this kind of, it's almost like the origin site for the people in the U.S.

339
00:22:10,213 --> 00:22:21,420
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing is, though, you can win an Xbox system, the three Microsoft games, Project Gotham Racing, Cameo, and Perfect Dark, you can win that and a year of Xbox Live.

340
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:35,209
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, what you have to do, though, is you have to create a short video clip or, um, like a Photoshop of the Hex 168 logo, um, like you saw it somewhere.

341
00:22:35,389 --> 00:22:37,230
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like, you have to send them pictures.

342
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:45,236
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to get creative, you know, doing something like, you know, in California they have the lottery, you know, the mega lottery or whatever it is, and they have, you know, the

343
00:22:45,754 --> 00:22:49,777
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like a home video camera footage of this giant ticket flying through the air.

344
00:22:49,857 --> 00:22:51,458
[SPEAKER_00]: No, something like that, you know, you have to make.

345
00:22:51,959 --> 00:22:52,999
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like way too much.

346
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:59,264
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, the UK people, they get to just sign up and enter the drawing, but no, we have to actually work for it.

347
00:22:59,284 --> 00:23:02,386
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of want to say the hand thing with the DS.

348
00:23:02,426 --> 00:23:03,507
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's like that.

349
00:23:03,627 --> 00:23:06,910
[SPEAKER_01]: They'd mail you a hand if you take a picture for touching as good.

350
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:08,711
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, it kind of reminds me of that.

351
00:23:08,971 --> 00:23:12,614
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just another thing, the giveaway, more 360s.

352
00:23:13,034 --> 00:23:14,135
[SPEAKER_00]: And the win, I guess, you win a

353
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:17,572
[SPEAKER_00]: A trip to the pre-release party or something like that.

354
00:23:18,093 --> 00:23:18,513
[SPEAKER_00]: Eh, not bad.

355
00:23:18,833 --> 00:23:19,974
[SPEAKER_00]: But, eh.

356
00:23:20,975 --> 00:23:21,756
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I had to say.

357
00:23:22,116 --> 00:23:23,117
[SPEAKER_00]: Eh, I haven't paid for it.

358
00:23:23,177 --> 00:23:23,518
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't care.

359
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:25,340
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

360
00:23:26,941 --> 00:23:27,802
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I want to mention this.

361
00:23:27,902 --> 00:23:29,043
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll go back to Loki for some more stories.

362
00:23:29,063 --> 00:23:29,604
[SPEAKER_01]: You have more stories?

363
00:23:29,704 --> 00:23:30,845
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm sure I do.

364
00:23:30,965 --> 00:23:32,406
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, let me get this out first.

365
00:23:32,446 --> 00:23:33,147
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to mention this.

366
00:23:33,187 --> 00:23:36,410
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though it's not necessarily gaming specific...

367
00:23:37,437 --> 00:23:46,242
[SPEAKER_01]: The Senate Commerce Committee made a bill this week that says that in 2009 all transmissions will have to be digital television transmissions.

368
00:23:46,562 --> 00:23:50,464
[SPEAKER_01]: So it looks like HD is going to be the big thing in 2009 at the latest.

369
00:23:51,184 --> 00:23:56,587
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course they will be also doing the subsidization or something in the amount of $3 billion.

370
00:23:57,327 --> 00:23:58,608
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

371
00:24:23,174 --> 00:24:35,921
[SPEAKER_01]: But think about this, if your console life is five years, which it seems like most consoles have been lasting about five years on the market, that means that these consoles will need to be ready for this in 2009.

372
00:24:36,581 --> 00:24:43,685
[SPEAKER_01]: And it sounds like the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360 are both HD ready, but is Nintendo listening to this?

373
00:24:43,945 --> 00:24:47,427
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope so, because they said the revolution wouldn't support HDTV.

374
00:24:48,408 --> 00:24:51,850
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes me sad, so I hope they will reconsider in light of this bill.

375
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:56,433
[SPEAKER_01]: Because by the end of the console life of the revolution, they're going to be in trouble.

376
00:24:57,113 --> 00:24:58,614
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't think they're going to be in trouble.

377
00:24:58,654 --> 00:25:01,696
[SPEAKER_01]: They won't necessarily be in trouble, but they won't be as cool.

378
00:25:02,237 --> 00:25:04,718
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we still haven't heard everything about the revolution yet.

379
00:25:04,918 --> 00:25:05,479
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I know.

380
00:25:06,139 --> 00:25:14,004
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there's still a lot to come, but the whole HD thing still... I want somebody to come out and say Nintendo Revolution will support HDTV, and then I'll shut my mouth.

381
00:25:16,445 --> 00:25:24,807
[SPEAKER_01]: You know I'm going to buy it no matter what because I'm going to want to play whatever Zelda game and whatever Metroid game and whatever Mario game they put out on it because I'm a consumer whore like that.

382
00:25:25,327 --> 00:25:25,547
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.

383
00:25:29,168 --> 00:25:29,348
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

384
00:25:29,508 --> 00:25:30,268
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, what else you got?

385
00:25:31,309 --> 00:25:33,089
[SPEAKER_00]: I got this funny site.

386
00:25:33,149 --> 00:25:34,349
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just looking up here.

387
00:25:35,169 --> 00:25:42,231
[SPEAKER_00]: This Chinese site actually was spoofing Nintendogs and they have Nintendogs.

388
00:25:43,131 --> 00:25:44,772
[SPEAKER_00]: It says college girls and friends.

389
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:45,952
[SPEAKER_00]: So

390
00:25:46,724 --> 00:25:51,728
[SPEAKER_01]: I went and pulled it up and... Do you take the girls out for a walk and you have to clean up their poop?

391
00:25:52,348 --> 00:25:52,808
[SPEAKER_00]: Not quite.

392
00:25:53,229 --> 00:25:55,010
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like a dating sim type thing.

393
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:56,551
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is actually all Photoshopped.

394
00:25:56,591 --> 00:25:57,792
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh god, it sprung too!

395
00:25:59,953 --> 00:26:01,374
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a funny idea.

396
00:26:02,575 --> 00:26:05,517
[SPEAKER_00]: However, they're never going to go in that market because they're too family friendly.

397
00:26:05,797 --> 00:26:07,538
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody was very, very bored, apparently.

398
00:26:07,558 --> 00:26:09,640
[SPEAKER_00]: Very bored and very horny, I guess.

399
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,721
[SPEAKER_01]: Whoever made Nintendo Girls, go outside.

400
00:26:12,062 --> 00:26:12,462
[SPEAKER_01]: Seriously.

401
00:26:13,581 --> 00:26:16,423
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have an advice column tonight because DarkSakura's not here, but that's my advice.

402
00:26:16,603 --> 00:26:18,524
[SPEAKER_01]: If this is you, go outside, please.

403
00:26:19,084 --> 00:26:19,465
[SPEAKER_00]: Seriously.

404
00:26:19,485 --> 00:26:20,125
[SPEAKER_01]: Get some fresh air.

405
00:26:21,226 --> 00:26:27,670
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing is, Famitsu Magazine put up some pictures of Final Fantasy XII.

406
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:31,432
[SPEAKER_01]: Which we will be referring to from now on as the sexy Final Fantasy XII.

407
00:26:32,733 --> 00:26:33,233
[SPEAKER_00]: Just kidding.

408
00:26:33,253 --> 00:26:33,894
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

409
00:26:33,914 --> 00:26:36,515
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to admit, the screenshots are sexy.

410
00:26:37,276 --> 00:26:41,498
[SPEAKER_00]: They are pretty sexy, but to me it looks like console version of XI, to be honest.

411
00:26:41,918 --> 00:26:42,539
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's

412
00:26:44,054 --> 00:26:47,095
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you play the demo at E3 a couple years ago when they were actually demoing it?

413
00:26:47,315 --> 00:26:57,317
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, lord knows what's changed in the past two years, but the battle system felt like a fusion of Final Fantasy XI and the old school Final Fantasies, but I don't know, in the past couple years they might have changed that.

414
00:26:57,517 --> 00:26:57,917
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

415
00:26:58,317 --> 00:26:59,217
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to tell anymore.

416
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:01,098
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll probably show it next year, too.

417
00:27:02,018 --> 00:27:05,199
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna be like the new Halo 2 of E3.

418
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:07,879
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll show it like three years in a row without the damn game coming out.

419
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,520
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, I mean, and

420
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:13,345
[SPEAKER_00]: Dragon Quest VIII is coming around the corner here pretty soon.

421
00:27:13,365 --> 00:27:14,726
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not supposed to have that demo back there.

422
00:27:14,746 --> 00:27:15,386
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it is.

423
00:27:16,446 --> 00:27:18,107
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that'll be something to check out.

424
00:27:18,687 --> 00:27:28,612
[SPEAKER_00]: Except I have my whole qualms with Dragon Quest VIII looking exactly like Dragon Ball Z. Granted, I know it's the same artist, but come on.

425
00:27:29,212 --> 00:27:30,453
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks exactly the same.

426
00:27:30,513 --> 00:27:31,953
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, no.

427
00:27:33,094 --> 00:27:36,616
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like Dragon Ball Z. It even has Dragon in the name.

428
00:27:36,656 --> 00:27:38,316
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's, it's wrong.

429
00:27:39,177 --> 00:27:39,877
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very wrong.

430
00:27:41,824 --> 00:27:45,886
[SPEAKER_01]: I was looking at a story very briefly.

431
00:27:45,946 --> 00:27:48,508
[SPEAKER_01]: It talks about Japan reconsidering the game ratings.

432
00:27:48,868 --> 00:27:51,729
[SPEAKER_01]: They may adopt some stricter standards for 18-plus games.

433
00:27:51,749 --> 00:27:54,751
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder if that's a paranoia over in this country starting to set in over there.

434
00:27:55,572 --> 00:27:58,733
[SPEAKER_01]: There was basically like an event that happened.

435
00:27:58,773 --> 00:28:04,917
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like a gathering of top industry players, and they had a session, and the topic was video games and their effects on the youth.

436
00:28:06,638 --> 00:28:10,880
[SPEAKER_01]: And in a proposal by government representatives, which was kind of similar to what was going on here,

437
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:29,708
[SPEAKER_01]: They put forward an initiative that said that there would be a distinct indication of games' contents on the packaging to change the CERO 18 rating to something that is recommended for 18 and over to prohibited for under 18.

438
00:28:30,789 --> 00:28:37,952
[SPEAKER_01]: So then they came out and these companies got together and it sounds like Square Enix president Yoichi Wada said,

439
00:28:38,691 --> 00:28:44,952
[SPEAKER_01]: actually told the group that there was still a need for more studies to be done on the game's influence of children.

440
00:28:44,992 --> 00:28:49,133
[SPEAKER_01]: So, kind of almost the same battle that's going on over here is going on in Japan right now.

441
00:28:49,353 --> 00:28:49,993
[SPEAKER_01]: Very interesting.

442
00:28:51,993 --> 00:28:53,434
[SPEAKER_00]: One more thing I was going to mention here.

443
00:28:55,694 --> 00:28:58,575
[SPEAKER_00]: Gizmondo launched in the US, apparently.

444
00:28:58,595 --> 00:28:59,135
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's right.

445
00:28:59,995 --> 00:29:03,295
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reviews for it have been... I've heard some pretty negative reviews.

446
00:29:03,315 --> 00:29:04,016
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty bad.

447
00:29:04,116 --> 00:29:06,396
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I've heard that it's getting some negative reviews.

448
00:29:06,952 --> 00:29:08,533
[SPEAKER_01]: E3, SSX3, FIFA 2005, Sticky Balls

449
00:29:29,963 --> 00:29:57,598
[SPEAKER_00]: Which whatever the hell that is Doesn't sound like something I want to be walking to the counter with The other bad things about the Gizmondo When you turn it on it takes 40 seconds to boot The other thing is In order to turn it off you have to actually go through this menu Almost like Windows and you have to hit shut down The other thing though is it's available in two versions One for $2.29 which is being sold right now And then you have the premium version which is selling for $3.39

450
00:30:00,284 --> 00:30:04,406
[SPEAKER_00]: The 229 version, you get ads sent to your Gizmondo.

451
00:30:04,887 --> 00:30:10,289
[SPEAKER_00]: And in order to shut off your Gizmondo, you have to watch the three ads each day.

452
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:14,311
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the 339 version, you don't get ads.

453
00:30:15,812 --> 00:30:17,373
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that a... That's the truth?

454
00:30:17,633 --> 00:30:19,854
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a real truth about the system?

455
00:30:20,314 --> 00:30:21,355
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the reviews said that.

456
00:30:23,276 --> 00:30:29,479
[SPEAKER_01]: If that is for real, then this... Yeah, I'm lost for words.

457
00:30:30,171 --> 00:30:39,098
[SPEAKER_01]: It seemed like an interesting idea at E3 and has quickly become... If that is true, I may proclaim this thing the worst gaming system of the past several years.

458
00:30:40,239 --> 00:30:40,619
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

459
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,342
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another system out there that really does want that title.

460
00:30:44,362 --> 00:30:45,102
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that?

461
00:30:45,122 --> 00:30:45,803
[SPEAKER_00]: The Phantom?

462
00:30:45,843 --> 00:30:46,603
[SPEAKER_00]: The N-Gage.

463
00:30:47,084 --> 00:30:48,705
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, shit, yeah.

464
00:30:49,366 --> 00:30:50,066
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a tough call.

465
00:30:50,446 --> 00:30:55,110
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm afraid to say even with the 40 second load... The N-Gage won't freaking show you ads when you shut it down, though.

466
00:30:57,964 --> 00:30:58,364
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny, though.

467
00:30:58,384 --> 00:31:01,445
[SPEAKER_00]: They said that one way you could bypass those is pull out the batteries, but, you know.

468
00:31:01,625 --> 00:31:04,245
That's so stupid.

469
00:31:05,546 --> 00:31:07,826
[SPEAKER_00]: Why did you pay $339 for the system anyways?

470
00:31:08,546 --> 00:31:15,748
[SPEAKER_00]: I could have this really crappy handheld system, or, I don't know, I could get a 360, get a PSP, get any other system out there on the market.

471
00:31:17,269 --> 00:31:18,349
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice knowing you, Gizmondo.

472
00:31:18,529 --> 00:31:19,049
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice knowing you.

473
00:31:19,889 --> 00:31:21,610
[SPEAKER_01]: Follow-up to something we were talking about last week.

474
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:23,330
[SPEAKER_01]: Children of Mana on the DS.

475
00:31:24,038 --> 00:31:25,220
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, Famitsu Magazine.

476
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:28,047
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again, spilling the beans on what's going on with Children of Mana.

477
00:31:29,049 --> 00:31:31,013
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, you know, going to be a very...

478
00:31:32,472 --> 00:31:33,553
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

479
00:31:56,991 --> 00:32:01,793
[SPEAKER_01]: And depending on the character that you're doing, you will be able to do different actions with your weapon.

480
00:32:02,133 --> 00:32:08,135
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you play as Frick, you can block incoming attacks with a guard and you can cut grass and stuff.

481
00:32:09,095 --> 00:32:16,277
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Pop, the character, has a flail, but it has a really large attack range and can do a boomerang thing and get long distance items.

482
00:32:16,701 --> 00:32:21,483
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's another character, Tumble, and you can stun enemies from a long range with arrows.

483
00:32:21,863 --> 00:32:25,365
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's also going to be a fever gauge that will build up as you attack enemies.

484
00:32:25,725 --> 00:32:28,767
[SPEAKER_01]: When it's full, you do a super attack that's unique for each weapon.

485
00:32:29,127 --> 00:32:34,869
[SPEAKER_01]: Why they're calling it a fever gauge and not a limit break, which it just sounds the same damn thing as, I'm not sure.

486
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:36,790
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever.

487
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:37,471
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool.

488
00:32:38,111 --> 00:32:39,051
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds like it'll be pretty cool.

489
00:32:39,071 --> 00:32:40,032
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll definitely want to check that out.

490
00:32:41,993 --> 00:32:44,854
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know we love to talk about video games that are being made into movies.

491
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,460
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, usually most of them.

492
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,961
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you go see Doom this weekend?

493
00:32:49,421 --> 00:32:49,721
[SPEAKER_01]: Not yet.

494
00:32:50,241 --> 00:32:52,701
[SPEAKER_00]: I have plans to go see it no matter how bad it is.

495
00:32:53,001 --> 00:32:54,522
[SPEAKER_01]: I will not probably see this.

496
00:32:54,582 --> 00:32:56,802
[SPEAKER_01]: I like Doom.

497
00:32:56,862 --> 00:32:57,682
[SPEAKER_01]: I respect Doom.

498
00:32:57,742 --> 00:32:58,422
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a series.

499
00:32:58,482 --> 00:32:59,022
[SPEAKER_01]: I like Doom 3.

500
00:32:59,242 --> 00:32:59,942
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it was cool.

501
00:32:59,962 --> 00:33:00,643
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a popcorn movie.

502
00:33:00,663 --> 00:33:01,283
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't need the movie.

503
00:33:01,523 --> 00:33:02,203
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't need the movie.

504
00:33:02,743 --> 00:33:03,863
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a popcorn movie.

505
00:33:04,003 --> 00:33:05,823
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a poisoned popcorn movie.

506
00:33:06,664 --> 00:33:10,184
[SPEAKER_00]: People are looking for some great acting stuff.

507
00:33:10,464 --> 00:33:14,325
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to find it in video game movies until some other actual...

508
00:33:15,046 --> 00:33:16,267
[SPEAKER_01]: Well-directed ones come out.

509
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:22,950
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand that, but even like... I don't know, even like Mortal Kombat had a halfway decent story, I suppose.

510
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:29,573
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't... I really don't... And Christopher Lambert was... I really don't understand how you can't make a good video game movie.

511
00:33:29,893 --> 00:33:30,694
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that different.

512
00:33:30,714 --> 00:33:36,116
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just... Instead of taking the source materials from a book, a play, or something like that, you're taking it from a game.

513
00:33:36,516 --> 00:33:37,037
[SPEAKER_00]: Big deal.

514
00:33:37,157 --> 00:33:37,397
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean...

515
00:33:38,148 --> 00:33:38,668
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

516
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:06,819
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's just, they didn't go like all pixelated.

517
00:34:06,839 --> 00:34:08,220
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't stomp on Goombas and stuff.

518
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:08,821
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.

519
00:34:09,241 --> 00:34:10,602
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not retarded like that.

520
00:34:11,243 --> 00:34:13,205
[SPEAKER_00]: But, of course, you know, Super Mario Bros.

521
00:34:13,225 --> 00:34:19,931
[SPEAKER_00]: the movie came out when they were making these really strange sci-fi movies, you know, like Waterworld and, you know, Judge Dredd and stuff.

522
00:34:20,211 --> 00:34:20,411
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

523
00:34:20,431 --> 00:34:22,533
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a whole other trend, but whatever.

524
00:34:23,273 --> 00:34:24,835
[SPEAKER_01]: I still have high hopes for Silent Hill.

525
00:34:25,235 --> 00:34:29,519
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's like one little publicity photo out right now, which tells you nothing about the movie, but...

526
00:34:30,374 --> 00:34:30,775
[SPEAKER_01]: House of the Dead

527
00:34:56,718 --> 00:34:57,078
[SPEAKER_00]: Dungeon Siege

528
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,000
[SPEAKER_01]: by Microsoft.

529
00:35:35,714 --> 00:35:37,055
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a fan of Swordfish, though.

530
00:36:03,766 --> 00:36:07,708
[SPEAKER_00]: That movie basically said, I'm going to kick your ass in the very beginning of the movie, and it did that.

531
00:36:07,888 --> 00:36:08,389
[SPEAKER_00]: It was awesome.

532
00:36:09,309 --> 00:36:10,530
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw like half of it.

533
00:36:11,611 --> 00:36:12,551
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a great movie.

534
00:36:12,571 --> 00:36:14,292
[SPEAKER_00]: I fell asleep.

535
00:36:14,412 --> 00:36:18,194
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole movie was just the villain winning, and that was the best part of the whole movie.

536
00:36:19,595 --> 00:36:20,035
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

537
00:36:20,175 --> 00:36:21,336
[SPEAKER_01]: No more stories from you, Loki?

538
00:36:21,576 --> 00:36:23,197
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I got a couple things about the PSP.

539
00:36:23,357 --> 00:36:24,178
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, what's up?

540
00:36:25,439 --> 00:36:27,280
[SPEAKER_00]: The first being that there's a game coming out.

541
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,821
[SPEAKER_00]: It's supposed to be released, I believe, in December.

542
00:36:30,081 --> 00:36:30,842
[SPEAKER_00]: DJ Maxx.

543
00:36:31,042 --> 00:36:31,342
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a

544
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:32,649
[SPEAKER_00]: Beep Mania

545
00:36:47,617 --> 00:36:48,998
[SPEAKER_00]: Out on the website now.

546
00:36:49,478 --> 00:36:52,400
[SPEAKER_00]: They're also on PSP Updates, which is pretty cool.

547
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:56,903
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing for music gaming fans is this game called Button Mashing Revolution.

548
00:36:58,564 --> 00:36:59,965
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when you play DDR on a controller.

549
00:37:00,065 --> 00:37:01,987
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, DDR on a controller.

550
00:37:02,307 --> 00:37:03,047
[SPEAKER_00]: They have it for PSP.

551
00:37:03,067 --> 00:37:07,670
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go download it on PSPUpdates.com as well.

552
00:37:08,171 --> 00:37:10,592
[SPEAKER_00]: Another interesting thing I saw is they have a Pac-Man race.

553
00:37:10,612 --> 00:37:11,993
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait, wait, does it have Butterfly?

554
00:37:12,614 --> 00:37:13,014
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

555
00:37:14,830 --> 00:37:16,952
[SPEAKER_00]: Pac-Man World Rally Crash Bandicoot Racing

556
00:37:31,201 --> 00:37:32,482
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for watching!

557
00:37:47,836 --> 00:37:49,418
[SPEAKER_01]: My Faith in the Crash Bandicoot series went out the door.

558
00:37:49,438 --> 00:37:50,619
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to hear what they did for this one?

559
00:37:50,659 --> 00:37:52,761
[SPEAKER_00]: They made it a platform game and a racing game.

560
00:37:52,801 --> 00:37:54,563
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can get out of your car and do platform stuff.

561
00:37:54,583 --> 00:37:56,164
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, but it's a racing game.

562
00:37:56,444 --> 00:38:01,549
[SPEAKER_01]: Wouldn't you lose the race if you got out of your car to lay spikes down maybe or something?

563
00:38:01,569 --> 00:38:02,530
[SPEAKER_01]: I forget.

564
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:02,931
[SPEAKER_01]: It's dumb.

565
00:38:02,951 --> 00:38:03,531
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, sorry.

566
00:38:03,571 --> 00:38:04,152
[SPEAKER_01]: Batman World.

567
00:38:04,432 --> 00:38:13,434
[SPEAKER_01]: Pac-Man World Race, uh, World Rally, um... Wait, wait, wait, I said... Wait, this is weird, because isn't there that Mario Kart arcade game coming out?

568
00:38:13,554 --> 00:38:13,694
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

569
00:38:13,714 --> 00:38:16,415
[SPEAKER_01]: And aren't there supposed to be Namco characters in that game?

570
00:38:16,555 --> 00:38:16,995
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there are.

571
00:38:17,015 --> 00:38:20,076
[SPEAKER_01]: Because Namco's a part of that whole Triforce thing that did the F-Zero game?

572
00:38:20,156 --> 00:38:20,616
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, there is.

573
00:38:20,876 --> 00:38:22,817
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's weird, because...

574
00:38:24,326 --> 00:38:26,649
[SPEAKER_01]: If this is coming out to compete with Mario Kart...

575
00:38:39,607 --> 00:38:42,349
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing that they ported was Quake 2 this week.

576
00:38:42,509 --> 00:38:44,690
[SPEAKER_00]: They've done a new port of that, and that's pretty awesome.

577
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:47,531
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm not a huge Quake fan, so... I'm going to check it out.

578
00:38:47,551 --> 00:38:47,971
[SPEAKER_01]: I like Quake.

579
00:38:48,152 --> 00:38:49,792
[SPEAKER_01]: But Quake 2, I mean... I like the first Quake, though.

580
00:38:49,812 --> 00:38:51,413
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still a purist with the first Quake.

581
00:38:51,873 --> 00:38:57,436
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, they have Quake 2, or Quake 1 available right now, and that's pretty awesome.

582
00:38:57,636 --> 00:38:59,617
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, Quake 2 is just going to be even more awesome.

583
00:39:01,558 --> 00:39:02,459
[SPEAKER_01]: Not necessarily.

584
00:39:02,699 --> 00:39:03,639
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of skipped over Quake 2.

585
00:39:03,779 --> 00:39:06,681
[SPEAKER_01]: I played a lot of Quake 1, played a lot of Quake 3, didn't play a lot of Quake 2.

586
00:39:06,721 --> 00:39:07,942
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

587
00:39:08,122 --> 00:39:08,842
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just weird like that.

588
00:39:10,321 --> 00:39:11,582
[SPEAKER_01]: Last story of the night, guys.

589
00:39:11,982 --> 00:39:22,926
[SPEAKER_01]: Hideo Kojima has a blog out there, and it's been out there for a little while on the Kojima Productions website, but now it's in English, so you can kind of check out some of the things he talks about in his blog.

590
00:39:22,946 --> 00:39:25,027
[SPEAKER_01]: What's kind of interesting, he doesn't just talk about games.

591
00:39:25,067 --> 00:39:31,669
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, he talked about directing Metal Gear Solid 4, and he's talked about some personal things, but he talks about kind of random things as well.

592
00:39:31,689 --> 00:39:35,131
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought this was an interesting quote, what he said about Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, the movie.

593
00:39:36,631 --> 00:39:37,031
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting quote.

594
00:39:37,051 --> 00:39:37,171
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

595
00:39:37,191 --> 00:39:38,152
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I aspire to be Veruca Salt.

596
00:39:38,212 --> 00:39:39,113
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know about you, but...

597
00:40:07,133 --> 00:40:07,453
[SPEAKER_01]: Forget it.

598
00:40:08,374 --> 00:40:08,674
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

599
00:40:09,435 --> 00:40:11,196
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, the last thing I've got.

600
00:40:12,017 --> 00:40:12,757
[SPEAKER_00]: SQ Stare.

601
00:40:13,598 --> 00:40:14,278
[SPEAKER_00]: You might remember him.

602
00:40:14,339 --> 00:40:19,182
[SPEAKER_00]: He's the guy that's working on hacking the Wi-Fi in the DS.

603
00:40:19,442 --> 00:40:23,145
[SPEAKER_00]: He's closing in on the bounty, which stands right now at $2,694.15.

604
00:40:23,185 --> 00:40:24,987
[SPEAKER_00]: But he's pretty much almost 100% done with everything.

605
00:40:25,007 --> 00:40:27,589
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a few more things to work on, but

606
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:38,301
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty soon they're going to be hacking that, and God knows what that's going to bring.

607
00:40:38,981 --> 00:40:43,184
[SPEAKER_00]: But I hear some pretty cool things are going to be coming out for the DS and the Revolution.

608
00:40:43,244 --> 00:40:44,844
[SPEAKER_00]: I know they're talking about a new Mario Paint.

609
00:40:46,185 --> 00:40:46,705
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.

610
00:40:46,786 --> 00:40:48,587
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, like a Mario Paint with a Revolution would be cool.

611
00:40:48,647 --> 00:40:52,849
[SPEAKER_00]: Mario Paint Revolution, and imagine Wi-Fi with the DS.

612
00:40:53,269 --> 00:40:54,890
[SPEAKER_00]: Be able to post your pictures.

613
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:55,771
[SPEAKER_00]: PictoChat on HD.

614
00:40:55,791 --> 00:40:57,191
[SPEAKER_00]: PictoChat online, yeah.

615
00:40:57,231 --> 00:40:57,852
[SPEAKER_00]: That's beautiful.

616
00:40:58,292 --> 00:40:59,953
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll have to look forward to that.

617
00:41:00,033 --> 00:41:00,733
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, sounds good.

618
00:41:01,394 --> 00:41:02,494
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, final thoughts.

619
00:41:02,514 --> 00:41:03,115
[SPEAKER_00]: Your final thought.

620
00:41:04,546 --> 00:41:09,089
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have to try maybe picking up Metroid Pinball this week because I want to see about that Rumble Pack thing.

621
00:41:09,569 --> 00:41:10,410
[SPEAKER_00]: That might be interesting.

622
00:41:10,450 --> 00:41:11,551
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man, too many games to buy.

623
00:41:11,591 --> 00:41:13,512
[SPEAKER_01]: My final thought is there's too many games to buy.

624
00:41:13,552 --> 00:41:15,454
[SPEAKER_01]: We're getting in that month now where I'm going to be broke.

625
00:41:15,574 --> 00:41:17,395
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh wait, the Christmas season now.

626
00:41:17,455 --> 00:41:17,835
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to die.

627
00:41:17,855 --> 00:41:18,376
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait until November.

628
00:41:18,396 --> 00:41:19,977
[SPEAKER_00]: November is like 50 billion games.

629
00:41:19,997 --> 00:41:20,477
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to die.

630
00:41:20,557 --> 00:41:22,279
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be a fun month for us though with this show.

631
00:41:23,331 --> 00:41:24,391
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

632
00:41:48,021 --> 00:41:48,842
[SPEAKER_00]: Rush to Rock, Rush 2049

633
00:42:17,859 --> 00:42:34,409
[SPEAKER_01]: Prapa the Rappa and DDR and in DDR there's been a musician in several of the Dance Dance Revolution games who anybody who's really into the Dance Dance Revolution games knows and really respects and that's Captain Jack Captain Jack passed away this week at the age of 43 of a stroke

634
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:35,910
[SPEAKER_01]: and DarkSakura.

635
00:42:50,077 --> 00:42:53,261
[SPEAKER_01]: It was not going to be critically acclaimed.

636
00:42:53,782 --> 00:42:58,207
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just about fun and getting stuck in your head with those little march songs.

637
00:42:58,807 --> 00:43:00,209
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, that's what DDR is all about.

638
00:43:00,229 --> 00:43:07,518
[SPEAKER_01]: Because a lot of people, when they get into DDR, they go play it and then they run home and they burn a CD of all the DDR songs and listen to it in their car and show all their friends and stuff.

639
00:43:07,938 --> 00:43:09,320
[SPEAKER_01]: And Captain Jack's just a part of that.

640
00:43:09,810 --> 00:43:31,456
[SPEAKER_01]: and the dance game community and really the music community as a whole lost somebody really awesome this week so we wanted to dedicate tonight's episode to Captain Jack and although we don't normally play music on the podcast we felt tonight it would be appropriate to play a little clip of you guys of Captain Jack with Together and Forever so we're going to close out with this tonight have a great week and we'll see you next week

641
00:44:26,445 --> 00:44:30,053
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the end of another Orange Lounge Radio To Go edition.

642
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:35,866
[SPEAKER_03]: This podcast is a proud part of www.orangeloungeradio.com.

643
00:44:36,327 --> 00:44:37,329
[SPEAKER_03]: See you next update.
