9
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,260
off, but over there in the other corner is the one and only Loki.

10
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:46,260
Yep, still here. Yep, still here. How you doing?

11
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:48,780
Good. Frustrated. Frustrated? Why?

12
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:52,020
Oh, web page crap. Yeah. Our web page?

13
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,820
Yes, our web page. OrangeLaunchRadio.com or the OLR PSP site?

14
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:02,940
The problem is, I don't know how to program in said languages that I'm programming in,

15
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,300
and so, yeah, it's a little difficult.

16
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:06,660
It's kind of a learning experience.

17
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:09,400
You must be trying to cook up some cool stuff for the site.

18
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,400
Of course.

19
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,400
All right.

20
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,400
Sounds good.

21
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,400
Check that out.

22
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,400
OLRPSP.com.

23
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,400
It's our new site just for the PSPs.

24
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:20,060
I mean, you can bring it up on like Internet Explorer or Firefox, but seriously, it's really

25
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:21,060
made for your PSP.

26
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:22,620
It looks so much better on a PSP.

27
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:26,780
If you bring it up in Firefox, you're going to go, what the heck, this doesn't look right.

28
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:30,780
But on a PSP it looks great. High def and everything, it's awesome.

29
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,060
Yeah, we're working on something that's kind of with the theme of the normal

30
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:35,660
station that is, you know,

31
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:42,020
getting our listeners to basically give us feedback and just a

32
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:44,380
whole way of connecting with our listeners.

33
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:48,740
Absolutely. So, actually we also have the Orange Lounge Radio message line which

34
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:52,060
just opened up on our website for our live show, so we might be using that on our

35
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:53,700
podcast as well, so

36
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:58,220
It's more interactivity to make this a little bit your show as well because we appreciate

37
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:00,680
you guys tuning in and taking the time to listen.

38
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:05,020
So it's just Loki and I tonight and nobody else wanted to come, nobody else wanted to

39
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:06,020
be on the podcast.

40
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,820
No, it's cool.

41
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:12,020
We got a little bit of news to talk about tonight, but first we always talk about how

42
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:16,140
our gaming week was, what we've been playing and what's new in our gaming world because

43
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,140
you know what?

44
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:18,140
We're geeks too.

45
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:19,140
Loki, what have you been playing?

46
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:22,180
I have been playing a couple of things.

47
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:26,900
I started off with Burnout because I had to get the rest of Burnout out of my system and

48
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:31,180
then I've got my new baby and that would be The Warriors.

49
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:32,180
The Warriors?

50
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,180
I've never even heard of this.

51
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,180
What's this about?

52
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:37,900
The Warriors is a game based on the 1979 movie starring Michael Beck.

53
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:41,460
It's basically about the gangs of New York.

54
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:48,900
This is about gangs during 1979.

55
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:52,860
really cheesy themed gangs like you have a gang called the baseball furies are

56
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:57,240
dressed up like baseball players you have a gang of like mime looking people

57
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:01,840
when you're a jet you know yes seriously it looks like that it's very similar to

58
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,720
that but it's just so cheesy and cool the game is really awesome it's kind of

59
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,580
like a final fight type game where you just beat up everything but they've

60
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:11,600
actually have a story to it it actually takes place three months before the

61
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,320
events of the movie then the very end of the game goes through the events of the

62
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:21,080
movie. The story of the movie is that there's this one guy who's calling all these gangs

63
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:24,960
together to unite them because they outnumber the police and they're basically going to

64
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:31,040
take over New York. Well, this other gang frames the Warriors and they kill the guy

65
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,360
and so now everybody's out to kill you and so you have to get back to your home turf

66
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,080
of Coney Island before you get beaten to death.

67
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:43,000
this must be a rock star game it's a rock star game it's really awesome I

68
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,940
highly recommend checking out we actually what's cool about it is they

69
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:47,240
have a quick match mode

70
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:51,400
where you can just do fighting so you can do two-player co-op in it which is awesome

71
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,040
and it's just it's a really fun game to pick up there's tons of unlockable

72
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:55,640
what system?

73
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:59,640
PlayStation 2 and Xbox. Oh and Xbox Live on Xbox?

74
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,920
No. Oh bummer. Yeah but it's really awesome

75
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:06,520
and then this next week in a few days here I'll be picking up Grand Theft Auto

76
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:10,920
of Liberty City Stories, which I'm very excited about that one.

77
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,320
Speaking of Xbox, do you know what Xbox Live is going to be?

78
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,000
Not that you care, because you don't really play Xbox Live, right?

79
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I don't have an Xbox.

80
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,600
I thought you got one, finally, but you're going to be getting a 360, right?

81
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,600
Yeah.

82
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,200
So are you going to buy any old Xbox games to catch up on what you missed?

83
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,960
Maybe Far Cry, because I've been hearing that's good.

84
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,600
Not even like Burnout on the Xbox, so you can play on Live, right?

85
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:35,080
Burnout for the 360 is coming out in March, so I've got to wait for Burnout.

86
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,080
Who cares about the other ones?

87
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,640
Alright, you know they're taking down Xbox Live for a day,

88
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:43,680
I don't get on Xbox Live that much so it's not too big a deal,

89
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,360
but they're gonna be changing it and getting it ready for the Xbox 360

90
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,640
and so I guess, you know, I was kinda trying to look into and during our

91
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,640
three-hour show

92
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:57,120
earlier this week we were kinda talking to some of our listeners, trying to get feedback on how the new

93
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,600
Xbox 360, what their thoughts are on it, and it sounds like you're gonna be actually

94
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,720
able to change your gamertag whenever you want on the new 360,

95
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,800
it's tied to your passport. You know the whole Microsoft passport thing?

96
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,360
They're integrating that into the 360 it sounds like, so

97
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,360
that's kinda what we're hearing. Well that's cool, at least in that way you can have a

98
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,320
gamertag, you know, that other people might have, and

99
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:21,800
I don't know, that'd be interesting. Well maybe, I mean, I don't know if we can duplicate names still, but

100
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,320
as long as I can keep my old one I guess that's okay. Yeah.

101
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:29,720
Even though I don't, you know, there's better names I would have liked, but oh well.

102
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:33,320
Anyway, anything else you've been playing in your gameweek? Really, no.

103
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:38,360
I've been just trying to play some of, I'm trying to, I have Shot of Colossus but I haven't

104
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,200
gotten a chance to play it yet.

105
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:44,400
And so I want to check that one out and maybe Tony Hawk's American Wasteland.

106
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,480
But I haven't gotten a chance to play him yet.

107
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,480
Real life?

108
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,680
Um, yeah.

109
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,480
Real life and just web page crap.

110
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,480
Alright, alright.

111
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:57,380
My Gaming Week actually has been pretty mellow.

112
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:00,640
It's been mostly World of Warcraft, which I talked about on last week's show is, you

113
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:03,920
You know, I went out and got it and it was this big, oh, I've got World of Warcraft.

114
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,560
But I've been playing it and I've been giving it a fair chance and kind of checking it out

115
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,560
and seeing what I think of it.

116
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:10,900
And you know, I actually kind of like it.

117
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:14,440
It's a lot better than I thought it would be because, you know, remember guys, I played

118
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:18,140
Final Fantasy XI for like two years, so of course I hear nothing but smack talking about

119
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,140
World of Warcraft.

120
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:25,260
But one thing I'm learning about the MMOs as I'm playing World of Warcraft is it really

121
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:28,840
is just a much different game than Final Fantasy XI.

122
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:33,000
very different and it has a whole lot of different things to offer and it's not

123
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,040
necessarily better or worse it's just that even though World of Warcraft and

124
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,980
Final Fantasy 11 and let's say let's take some of the other big ones too

125
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:45,440
Guild Wars and Ragnarok they're all MMOs but they've all got very very different

126
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,680
things to offer and I think it really boils down to this if you're looking

127
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:52,880
into getting into MMOs if you don't like MMOs you're not gonna like Final Fantasy

128
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:57,160
11 or World of Warcraft either the I think the easiest accessible one to

129
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:00,760
somebody who doesn't like MMOs at all, although I don't know why you'd be considering buying

130
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:05,520
an MMO, probably Guild Wars, because Guild Wars is practically set up so that you don't

131
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,800
even have to ever play with anybody, and you don't play a monthly fee with Guild Wars.

132
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:13,040
Not that I think Guild Wars is necessarily the strongest game, nor is it my favorite

133
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:21,440
out of the three, but I think it's probably the most accessible and most, like, non-shocking

134
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,340
the game is kind of set up very similar to a single player experience, if you want it

135
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:26,860
to be.

136
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:30,780
But as far as Final Fantasy XI and World of Warcraft, I'm just noticing it is very true

137
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,100
what they say.

138
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:35,480
World of Warcraft is a game that you don't have to play with other people.

139
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:39,700
You can play with it by yourself, except I am learning that it's a lot better to play

140
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:43,140
with other people and there's more quests you can do and things that you do with other

141
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:44,140
people.

142
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:48,580
But I still feel that Final Fantasy XI is probably the more social game.

143
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:52,900
If you're looking for a game that you want to do some role play in or you just want to

144
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:26,740
already have it. I'm really a late bloomer when it comes to this game just because I've

145
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:32,080
been focused on one MMO for so long. But if you have an interest in the game and you think

146
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:37,620
it sounds like something you'd like, check it out. I think you'll find it's really different

147
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:40,740
than the other MMOs out there except for Guild Wars because Guild Wars and World of Warcraft

148
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:45,700
have a lot in common. They really do, just in the game, the way it plays. To me, it feels

149
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:51,680
very similar. I think World of Warcraft has a lot more than Guild Wars, about 40 more

150
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:56,200
levels for one, and more crafting and stuff you can do that I think makes it a little

151
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:01,440
more... longer gameplay than Guild Wars would be.

152
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:07,520
So I haven't played Final Fantasy yet again. Still waiting for that time to come in, but

153
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,760
it's not there.

154
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:13,160
I'm just on a cool off period from Final Fantasy XI for a little while myself. I need to just

155
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:17,420
take a step back. I'm not saying I dislike the game at all. I still think it's an awesome

156
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:22,320
game and I love it a lot and I'll probably get back into it once the 360 and Treasures

157
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,520
of Autoregan expansions kind of pump some new blood into the game.

158
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:30,220
By that time I'll probably be burned out of World of Warcraft so it works out.

159
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:37,500
Yeah, my only thing is hopefully that they're going to have the Final Fantasy XI version

160
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,660
for the 360 is going to be on the same surface as everyone else.

161
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:41,660
Hoping.

162
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:43,180
I don't know if it is.

163
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:44,180
I'm not sure if it is.

164
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:47,060
Well, you know, I heard it's not going to support the voice chat because the voice chat

165
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:51,060
is going to be unmoderated, which doesn't make sense to me because...

166
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:54,620
Oh, I wouldn't want voice chat anyways.

167
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:56,700
Imagine Final Fantasy XI voice chat.

168
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:57,700
I've done it.

169
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:03,460
Team speak or Ventrilo are one of those things.

170
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:07,060
That works fine when you have a group of people, but what if you have the world?

171
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:08,060
No, thank you.

172
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:09,060
Okay, I got you.

173
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:13,140
But, no, the whole thing is I just hope it's supported, period, because then that way I

174
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:17,660
can cancel my Play Online account, just move it all over the Xbox Live.

175
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:21,100
I have this feeling it's going to be set up like PSO where you have to pay for both, and

176
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:25,460
that's going to be sad. With Phantasy Star Online on Xbox, you have to pay not just the

177
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:29,580
Xbox Live, but then you pay the Sega fee of like $8 as well. Sucks.

178
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,580
Well, still they're going to have a break, I'm sure.

179
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:32,940
Yeah, we'll see.

180
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:33,940
I hope so. I hope so.

181
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:38,740
All right, let's get into some gaming news tonight, talk about some things going on in

182
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:45,640
gaming world. Speaking of the Xbox 360, Wal-Mart and EB Games and some other stores are starting

183
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:51,740
to get the little Xbox 360 kiosks. I havenít seen any show up, but there are some websites

184
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:56,340
set up that you can just go on to some of the major gaming portals. You can probably

185
00:10:56,340 --> 00:11:00,460
find some websites that have these lists set up of where all these gaming kiosks are.

186
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:04,020
They have lists. They even have a Google Map thing thatís set up for it.

187
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:06,980
But honestly, chances are itís going to be in the mall near you at some point.

188
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:11,820
They're going to be rolled out to almost every store in over three weeks.

189
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,540
They're shipping them out right now.

190
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,560
Obviously Microsoft's pushing this thing like crazy.

191
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:19,580
It's going to be in your local store soon enough, but if you just have to be first,

192
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:20,580
get on the internet and look.

193
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:24,380
I checked our local Walmart today because I just happened to be there, and no, they

194
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:25,380
didn't have them.

195
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:26,860
I'm not a big Walmart fan myself.

196
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:29,180
I'm more of a Target guy.

197
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:35,540
It's only a couple of demos, and honestly this is coming out in a few weeks anyways.

198
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:36,540
I can wait.

199
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:10,740
Let's talk a little bit about the PSP, which has shipped 10 million units.

200
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:14,580
That's what officials from Sony are announcing, that they have reached 10 million units, of

201
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:22,980
course, this being worldwide, 183 PSP software titles currently out, a total of 19.6 million

202
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:27,020
units of software shipped, and then 15 million UMD movies.

203
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:31,500
That's kind of crazy because that means almost just as many UMD movies have shipped as games.

204
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,500
Yeah.

205
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:37,140
And you know what's also crazy about it, if 10 million PSPs have shipped, then that means

206
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:43,180
like most people only own like one game.

207
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,180
And probably it's Luminous.

208
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,820
Probably one or two games.

209
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:46,820
It's probably Luminous.

210
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:47,820
Probably.

211
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,860
Well, I don't know.

212
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:50,860
Everybody I know, it's Luminous.

213
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:52,700
And honestly, it is the best PSP game out there.

214
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:55,140
I'm probably just unimpressed that the game's out right now like I am.

215
00:12:55,140 --> 00:13:00,380
I mean, it's just, I haven't bought it, I don't even remember the last PSP game I bought

216
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:04,440
other than Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories, everything I've gotten has been passed down

217
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:08,560
free from publishers and I wouldn't have even bought them if they hadn't given it to me

218
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,560
because I'm just unimpressed by everything that's coming out.

219
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,480
There just hasn't really been a title that's been like, I have to really get that, and

220
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,760
I'm kind of seeing that in the new Katamari PSP. I'm like, oh, I definitely get that because

221
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:22,800
I'm in the Katamari franchise, I'm into that. But we have yet to see a really solid franchise

222
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:28,160
game hit the PSP. I mean, granted, we've had Burnout and we've had Wipeout, I guess, and

223
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:32,200
We've had Metal Gear, but not really the same Metal Gear.

224
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:37,480
We've had some to extend the franchise, but we've really just had no solid franchise title

225
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,480
hit the PSP.

226
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,480
You know what I mean?

227
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,480
I think that's kind of what's hurting it.

228
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,560
Whereas on the DS, now you're getting like Castlevania, and it's seriously probably the

229
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:46,280
best Castlevania game they've done since Symphony of the Night.

230
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:50,400
So you know, DS is starting to look really good with the franchises.

231
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,400
Mario Kart?

232
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,600
Yeah, Mario Kart on the way, and Animal Crossing.

233
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,120
The whole internet connectivity stuff?

234
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,120
Yeah.

235
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:03,760
I know PSP has its loyalists out there, though.

236
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,960
If you have any emails, comments, or suggestions, you know I send us an email to go at orange

237
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:08,960
lounge radio dot com.

238
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,760
Maybe you're a PSP lover wanting to yell at us a little bit.

239
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,280
I don't dislike the PSP.

240
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:17,520
I think the PSP is a great multi-system, like getting to watch them, and you know that's

241
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:21,640
really what they're marketing it as, so on that end, it's successful that you can watch

242
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,640
movies.

243
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,640
I'm not talking about the PSP either.

244
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:26,760
I've got two of them, so obviously I love them, but it's just...

245
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:30,760
I love the fact that it's got the wireless Internet now, and you can download our show

246
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,760
on it.

247
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:37,960
It's great for that, but the games element alone, a little weak, a little weak.

248
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:41,520
When you see a game like Twisted Metal, you're thinking, ooh, Twisted Metal Black, that was

249
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,520
an awesome game.

250
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:48,240
Oh, wait, this is a port of Twisted Metal 2, a PlayStation game, oh, crap, Twisted Metal

251
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,720
for the PS3.

252
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:54,600
I know there's going to be one, that's going to be awesome.

253
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,600
the email box. DarkSakura is our mailbox queen, but she's not here tonight, unfortunately,

254
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,960
so we're going to go ahead and table the mailbox until next week, but definitely get your emails

255
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:02,960
in togo.orangelandradio.com.

256
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:07,880
I was talking a little bit about World of Warcraft earlier. You know there's an expansion

257
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:13,120
on the horizon, and of course, people love to gossip about the expansion packs. Here's

258
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,360
the latest rumors circulating around the Internet. We don't know how true they are, but they

259
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:22,920
seem to be pretty solid leads. The Burning Crusade sounds like it's going to be the name

260
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,100
of it and it's going to take place in the Outlands.

261
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,980
They're going to raise the level cap with this expansion to 70.

262
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:31,600
Some sites are saying 75, but most are saying 70.

263
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,920
It's going to have two new races.

264
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:36,920
The Blood Elf will belong to the Horde and to be announced for the Alliance.

265
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,360
However, no new classes at this time.

266
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,600
Again, these are all rumors.

267
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,920
Things might change.

268
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,000
Blizzard will make the official announcement any day now, I'm sure.

269
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,200
BlizzCon, is BlizzCon this weekend?

270
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,280
Was it this weekend or it's coming up next weekend?

271
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,280
I don't know.

272
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,280
I have no idea.

273
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:55,840
don't have time off work to go to these things, unfortunately, I would love to if I could.

274
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,280
Maybe next year, because I'm just now getting into World of Warcraft, maybe next year I'll

275
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,280
be ready for Blizzcon.

276
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:03,320
Anyway, they might do some small upgrades to the graphic engine as well, and they're

277
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,280
going to add weather effects, which I think is neat.

278
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:09,700
And then the other thing I think is neat, cross-server battlegrounds?

279
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:10,700
So we'll see.

280
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:15,000
Well, I actually, I was reading, because I was reading an article about this earlier,

281
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,640
and they were talking about some of the stuff that they're going to be having, and I could

282
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:27,600
was sworn they actually did name the, yeah, for Alliance it's Draenei or something like

283
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,600
that.

284
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,760
It's D-R-A-E-N-E-I is the race for the Alliance.

285
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:37,200
They have a new class, I guess Spellbreaker, they said, they're rumored saying it's going

286
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:43,040
to be race 275, six new areas and nine new high-end instances.

287
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,840
So it really just depends on what website you're looking at because everybody's reporting

288
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:49,460
something different at this point, but it seems okay, there's going to be a level cap

289
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:54,100
Some little things it looks like.

290
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,700
You know the other big rumor going around about World of Warcraft right now is that

291
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:00,020
it's going to go on to 360.

292
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:03,500
I'm certain Microsoft is really, really hoping for that because let's face it, World of Warcraft

293
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:08,060
right now is a PC only title and not everybody who is in the console is into PC.

294
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,060
I like both.

295
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:12,900
In fact, with Civilization 4 coming out this week, this is going to be a big month for

296
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:17,220
PC gaming for me.

297
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:22,420
folks that don't really cross those lines. They're a PC gamer or they're a console

298
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:26,860
gamer so if World of Warcraft came out on the 360 or any next-gen console

299
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:30,640
really that would be huge so I'd like to see it happen I think it would be good

300
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:37,320
news but who knows. So surely you've been following the drama and I'm sure anybody

301
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:40,420
who listens to this show probably has been following this too so I don't want

302
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:46,240
to beat a dead horse with this but Penny Arcade versus Jack Thompson oh my god

303
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:50,840
It's like we're watching Mortal Kombat seriously like what what happened here? We got we got a letter

304
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:55,620
I mean, I'm totally paraphrasing here, and I'm just going off memory because there's been so many news articles

305
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:58,340
I don't even remember anymore, but like Penny Arcade

306
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:04,880
Donated $10,000 because Jack Thompson was like haha. Just kidding about the you know the mod thing

307
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,720
He said he was going to donate or he was going to give $10,000 whoever did it

308
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:12,400
And then he said it was a joke and Penny Arcade put up the $10,000 because Jack Thompson wouldn't do it

309
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,400
it.

310
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:17,200
And then Jack Thompson basically wrote a letter to the police saying that the penny arcade

311
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,040
people are harassing him.

312
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:24,120
And then the penny arcade people filed something with like a legal association to get Jack

313
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,120
Thompson investigated.

314
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,740
No, what they were doing is they were actually, they sent a letter.

315
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:31,320
I'm completely paraphrasing here.

316
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:35,000
They sent letters to the Florida bar basically.

317
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,760
So Jack Thompson now turns around and files a complaint with the feds and the district

318
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,880
attorney and the rumor is he was calling for a truce.

319
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:48,080
Well, yeah, he's all over the place and he's emailing the Feds and stuff like this and

320
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,080
all his information.

321
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:53,840
I mean, if anybody actually, because anybody's going to do research on this and be like,

322
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:58,680
oh my God, you know, he's completely nuts because everything he's stating is completely

323
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,680
wrong.

324
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:05,000
So, I mean, anybody who does any research on this and doesn't take them for face value

325
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
is obviously going to see.

326
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,880
He's good at getting publicity, though, because even we're talking about him.

327
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,880
Maybe we shouldn't be.

328
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:10,880
I don't know.

329
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:16,840
No, we've got to point out that he's stupid. You've got to point out the retarded people.

330
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:25,840
I have to say, there seems to be a lot of politicians coming from Florida that are just

331
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:26,840
retarded.

332
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:30,500
Well, let's not go there because we don't want to get more hate mail from our friends

333
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,500
in Florida.

334
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,500
Politicians!

335
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,500
I know, just politicians.

336
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:45,500
Anyway, if I could offer words of advice to Penny Arcade, finish him.

337
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:52,680
Honestly, just let him dig himself his own grave, because it's going to happen.

338
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:58,800
He's just going to eventually get caught up in so many lies that he'll be over.

339
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,400
I have just a small little story on Civilization 4.

340
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:05,400
coming out this week, October 25th, and I want to buy this and check it out.

341
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,400
You know, I didn't...

342
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,360
I loved Civilization I, love Civilization I, I know I've gone off on a previous podcast

343
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:14,080
about how I think it's probably one of my favorite games of all time, if not my favorite

344
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,440
game of all time, is Civilization I, but I never really got into 2 or 3.

345
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:23,960
It just didn't have that simpleness, that accessibility of Civilization I, but Civ IV

346
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:26,800
is on the horizon and I'm just excited to at least check it out and see if I like it,

347
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:30,200
and I hear it's going to be really customizable and all this stuff, so it's coming out this

348
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:36,280
this week, and I'm curious about it. I wish I could rent PC games or something, because

349
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:40,720
I don't want to have to spend $49.99 on it, but it looks like I'm going to have to, so

350
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,680
we'll see. I know, I'm like, ah, oh well, we'll see.

351
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:48,040
Anyway, Loki, what do you have for us tonight? You got some news stories for us?

352
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:53,960
Yeah, a couple things to touch on here. The first one everybody's talking about, because

353
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:57,880
with the 360 coming up, what are the launch dates for these games that are coming out?

354
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:02,000
We have, what is it, Best Buy saying, oh yeah, we're going to have the games before they

355
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
launch.

356
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,160
Well, yeah, I doubt because everybody's releasing their games before the system launches.

357
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:11,000
I don't understand the lure of buying games before the system is out anyway.

358
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,400
Oh, I'm going to go home and look at the pretty packaging in the book.

359
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,480
Is it just to make the lines go faster when the system comes out?

360
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,480
I don't know.

361
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,480
I don't get it.

362
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,480
I think so.

363
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:22,300
Or just so there's not a huge rush on everything.

364
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:27,800
I'm getting my games before they come out just because I just want to pick everything

365
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:31,060
up when I get it, and then I'll have the system.

366
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:35,520
You guys know I didn't reserve my system, so I'm going to be playing the Rush the Crowds

367
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,520
game.

368
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:39,560
I did it with the DS and I did it with other systems in the past.

369
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,800
I'll do it with Xbox 360 as well.

370
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:45,600
The whole rumor is that they've been playing up the fact that they're in their oversold

371
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,600
line.

372
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,600
Big shock!

373
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,160
Every company says they're oversold when their systems come out.

374
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:53,560
saying that that was artificial to increase demand on the system or something like that

375
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,360
but what do we know?

376
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:59,280
What was that countdown thing you were blogging about earlier this week? There was a countdown

377
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,160
on the Xbox 360?

378
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,160
Hex 168.

379
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,840
Yeah, you talked about it last podcast.

380
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:08,480
Hex 168 is actually this kind of, it's like almost like the origin site for, you know,

381
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:14,440
the people in the U.S. The thing is though, you can win an Xbox system, the three Microsoft

382
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:20,880
games, Project Gotham Racing, Cameo, and Perfect Dark, you can win that and a year of Xbox

383
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,560
Live.

384
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:28,440
What you have to do though is you have to create a short video clip or like a Photoshop

385
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:37,320
of the Hex 168 logo like you saw it somewhere, you know, like you have to send them pictures.

386
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:41,380
So you have to get creative, you know, doing something like, you know, in California they

387
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:44,680
have the lottery you know the mega lottery or whatever it is and they have

388
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:49,000
you know that it looks like a home video camera footage of this giant ticket

389
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
flying through the air now something like that you know you have to make so

390
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,520
it's like way too late so basically the UK people they get to just sign up and

391
00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:00,480
enter the drawing but no we have to actually work for it and you don't want

392
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,200
to say that the hand thing with the DS yeah it's like that they'd mail you a

393
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:08,320
hand you take a picture for touching is good oh I don't know it's gonna remind

394
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:15,320
It's another thing to give away more 360's and the win I guess you win a trip to the

395
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:17,600
pre-release party or something like that.

396
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,020
Hey not bad.

397
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:26,020
But ehh, that's what I had to say. Eh I have it paid for, don't care.

398
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:31,040
I want to mention this and we'll go back to Loki for some more stories. Do you have more stories?

399
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:31,380
I'm sure I do.

400
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:36,320
Alright let me get this out first. Even though it's not necessarily gaming specific with

401
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:43,320
The Senate Commerce Committee made a bill this week that says that in 2009, all transmissions

402
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:46,620
will have to be digital, television transmissions.

403
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:51,180
So it looks like HD is going to be the big thing in 2009 at the latest.

404
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:57,400
Of course, they will be also doing the subsidization or something in the amount of $3 billion to

405
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:01,880
help folks that are having a hard time getting a new TV kind of get cheap converters for

406
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:05,640
their old TVs to get the HD signals, it should be interesting.

407
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:09,080
Of course, that means HDTVs will get cheaper.

408
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,320
They've been getting cheaper and cheaper for the past few years.

409
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:16,040
I paid $600 for my HDTV, which is only 30 inch, but it's not bad.

410
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,040
It's a great TV.

411
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,400
I love it.

412
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,120
They're just going to get cheaper as the years go on.

413
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:23,360
By the time 2009 rolls around, it won't be a big deal.

414
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,360
Think about this.

415
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:27,960
If your console life is five years, which it seems like most consoles have been lasting

416
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:35,000
about five years on the market, that means that these consoles will need to be ready

417
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:42,040
for this in 2009 and it sounds like the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360 are both HD ready but is

418
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,840
Nintendo listening to this?

419
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:49,320
I hope so because they said the revolution wouldn't support HDTV and that makes me sad

420
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:53,720
so I hope they will reconsider in light of this bill because by the end of the console

421
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:58,120
life of the revolution, they're going to be in trouble but I don't think they're going

422
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,120
to be in trouble.

423
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,040
They won't necessarily be in trouble but they won't be as cool.

424
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,880
I think we still haven't heard everything about the revolution yet.

425
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:05,880
Yeah, I know.

426
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:09,240
I know there's still a lot to come, but the whole HD thing stills...

427
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:13,480
I want somebody to come out and say Nintendo Revolution will support HDTV and then I will

428
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:16,480
shut my mouth.

429
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,740
You know I'm going to buy it no matter what, because I'm going to want to play whatever

430
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:23,640
Zelda game and whatever Metroid game or whatever Mario game they put out on it, because I'm

431
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,240
a consumer whore like that.

432
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,240
I know.

433
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,240
Yeah.

434
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:31,280
Alright, what else you got?

435
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:35,280
I got this funny site, I was just looking up here.

436
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:43,180
This Chinese site actually was spoofing Nintendogs and they have Nintendirls.

437
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:46,520
It says College Girls and Friends.

438
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,640
I went and pulled it up and...

439
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,440
Do you take the girls out for a walk and you have to clean up their poop?

440
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,440
Not quite.

441
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,040
It looks like a dating sim type thing.

442
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,600
I think this is actually all photoshopped.

443
00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:00,120
Oh God, it sprung too!

444
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:04,680
It's a funny idea, however, they're never going to go in that market because they're

445
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,680
too family friendly.

446
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,680
Somebody was very, very bored.

447
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,720
Very bored and very horny, I guess.

448
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:13,640
Whoever made it in Ten Girls, go outside, seriously.

449
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:16,640
We don't have an advice column tonight because Dark Sakura's not here, but that's my advice.

450
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,800
If this is you, go outside, please.

451
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,800
Seriously.

452
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,800
Get some fresh air.

453
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:27,880
The other thing is, Famitsu Magazine put up some pictures of Final Fantasy XII.

454
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:31,680
Which we will be referring to from now on as the sexy Final Fantasy XII.

455
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,680
Just kidding.

456
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,680
Okay.

457
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:36,800
Yeah, you have to admit, the screenshots are sexy.

458
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:41,800
They are pretty sexy, but to me it looks like console version of XI, to be honest.

459
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,160
I mean, it's got the same characters.

460
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:47,240
Did you play the demo at E3 a couple years ago when they were actually demoing it?

461
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:51,640
I mean, lord knows what's changed in the past two years, but the battle system felt like

462
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:55,960
a fusion of Final Fantasy XI and the old school Final Fantasies, but I don't know, in the

463
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:59,360
past couple years, they might have changed that. I don't know. It's hard to tell anymore.

464
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:05,480
They'll probably show it next year, too. It's going to be like the new Halo 2 of E3. They'll

465
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:08,400
show it like three years in a row without the damn game coming out.

466
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:13,560
Well, you know. I mean, Dragon Quest VIII is coming around the corner here pretty soon.

467
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,760
You're supposed to have that demo packed in.

468
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:21,520
Yes, it is. So, that would be something to check out. Except, I have my whole qualms

469
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:27,480
with Dragon Quest VIII looking exactly like Dragon Ball Z. Granted, I know it's the same

470
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:34,920
artist, but come on. It looks exactly the same. It's just, no. It's like Dragon Ball

471
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:42,320
Z. It even has Dragon in the name. It's wrong. It's very wrong. Yeah, I don't really have

472
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:47,000
much. All right, that's all right. I was looking at a story very briefly. It talks about Japan

473
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,440
reconsidering the game ratings. They may adopt some stricter standards for 18 plus

474
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:55,080
I wonder if that's a paranoia over in this country starting to set in over there.

475
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:58,760
There was basically like an event that happened.

476
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:03,380
It was like a gathering of top industry players and they had a session and the topic was video

477
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:06,840
games and their effects on the youth.

478
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:10,360
In a proposal by government representatives, which was kind of similar to what was going

479
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:16,180
on here, they put forward an initiative that said that there would be a distinct indication

480
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:26,820
of games contents on the packaging to change the CERO18 rating to something that is recommended

481
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:30,820
for 18 and over to prohibited for under 18.

482
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:36,460
So then they came out and these companies got together and it sounds like Square Enix

483
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:41,980
president Yoichi Wada actually told the group that there was still a need for more studies

484
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:45,060
to be done on the games influence of children.

485
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:18,420
as its games. Yes, and what games are on the Gizmondo?

486
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:22,980
The Gizmondo, they've got SSX3, last year's version of SSX,

487
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:26,260
and I believe FIFA 2005,

488
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:29,540
last year's version of that Sticky Balls,

489
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:33,060
which, whatever the hell that is. Doesn't sound like something I want to be walking to the

490
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:33,660
camera with?

491
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:36,780
The other bad things about the Gizmondo,

492
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:40,420
when you turn it on, it takes 40 seconds to boot.

493
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:44,140
The other thing is,

494
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:48,340
In order to turn it off, you have to actually go through this menu, almost like Windows,

495
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:49,980
and you have to hit shutdown.

496
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:54,700
The other thing though is it's available in two versions, one for $2.29, which is being

497
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:55,700
sold right now.

498
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:59,860
Then they're going to have the premium version, which is selling for $3.39.

499
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:07,180
The $2.29 version, you get ads sent to your Gizmondo, and in order to shut off your Gizmondo,

500
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:11,120
you have to watch the three ads each day.

501
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:16,760
And for the 3.39 version, you don't get ads, so...

502
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:17,840
That's the truth?

503
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,400
That's a real truth about the system?

504
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:23,360
One of the reviews said that.

505
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,640
If that is for real, then this...

506
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:30,260
Yeah, I'm lost for words.

507
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:34,240
It seemed like an interesting idea at E3 and it has quickly become...

508
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:39,080
If that is true, I may proclaim this thing the worst gaming system of the past several

509
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,080
years.

510
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:45,240
I don't know, there's another system out there that really does want that title and that

511
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,240
would be the N-Gage.

512
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,240
Oh shit, yeah.

513
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,240
That's a tough call.

514
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:53,880
I'm afraid to say, even with the 40 second load, the N-Gage won't frickin' show you

515
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,600
ads when you shut it down, though.

516
00:30:55,600 --> 00:31:00,860
It's funny though, they said that one way you could bypass those is pull out the batteries,

517
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:01,860
but you know.

518
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:02,860
That's so stupid.

519
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:08,440
Why would you pay $3.39 for the system anyways?

520
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:14,460
I could have this really crappy handheld system or I could get a 360, get a PSP, get any other

521
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:17,380
system out there on the market.

522
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:20,080
Nice knowing you Gizmondo, nice knowing you.

523
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:24,040
Follow up to something we were talking about last week, Children of Mana on the DS.

524
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:27,600
Of course, Famitsu magazine once again spilling the beans on what's going on with Children

525
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,120
of Mana.

526
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:40,000
It's going to be very similar to the previous Zelda games, Zelda style Secret Amano games.

527
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,920
It's going to be about 25 to 30 hours of gameplay plus side quests to keep things going longer.

528
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:49,200
What's also interesting about this, it's going to have a big anime opening sequence.

529
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,520
For those of you guys that have Castlevania DS and saw the big anime opening sequence,

530
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:55,000
they're going to have something like that in Children of Mana, which was kind of cool

531
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,320
as well.

532
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:01,280
Depending on the character that you're doing, you will be able to do different actions with

533
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,280
your weapon.

534
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:07,140
So if you play as Frick, you can block incoming attacks with like a guard and you can cut

535
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:09,160
grass and stuff.

536
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:13,480
And then Pop, the character, has a flail, but it has a really large attack range and

537
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:16,760
can kind of do like a boomerang thing and get long distance items.

538
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:20,960
And then there's another character, Tumble, and you can stun enemies from a long range

539
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:21,960
with arrows.

540
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:25,820
And there's also going to be a Fever Gauge that will build up as you attack enemies.

541
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:29,880
it's full, you do a super attack that's unique for each weapon. Why they're calling it a

542
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:34,480
fever gauge and not a limit break, which it just sounds the same damn thing as, I'm not

543
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:39,720
sure. Whatever, that's cool. Sounds like it'll be pretty cool. I'll definitely want to check

544
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:45,620
that out. And you know we love to talk about video games that are being made into movies.

545
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:50,740
Oh yeah, usually most of them. Did you go see Doom this weekend? Not yet. I have plans

546
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:52,860
to go see it no matter how bad it is.

547
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:55,820
I will not probably see this.

548
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:56,820
I like Doom.

549
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:57,820
I respect Doom.

550
00:32:57,820 --> 00:32:58,820
It's a series.

551
00:32:58,820 --> 00:32:59,820
I like Doom 3.

552
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:00,820
I thought it was cool.

553
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:01,820
It's a popcorn movie.

554
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:02,820
I didn't need the movie.

555
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:04,220
It's a popcorn movie.

556
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:10,540
People are looking for some great acting stuff.

557
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:15,640
You're not going to find it in video game movies until some other actual well-directed

558
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:16,640
ones come out.

559
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,640
I understand that.

560
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:23,400
like, I don't know, even Mortal Kombat had a halfway decent story, I suppose.

561
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:30,400
I really don't understand how you can't make a good video game movie. It's not that

562
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:35,360
different. Instead of taking the source materials from a book, a play, or something like that,

563
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:39,560
you're taking it from a game. Big deal. I mean, I don't know why these people can't

564
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:44,160
get it. They just want to do something special to pay homage to the game or do something

565
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:50,880
you know, Quirky, don't try that. Do just normal movie stuff. You don't have to go crazy

566
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,440
and do the first-person view for Doom.

567
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:56,260
Yeah, that's really what sold me on the fact that Doom is going to be stupid, is the first-person

568
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:57,260
thing.

569
00:33:57,260 --> 00:34:01,800
We get the fact that it was a first-person shooter game, but, you know, for, well, okay,

570
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:05,980
well, Super Mario Bros. movie was bad, but, I mean, well, it's just, they didn't go like

571
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:06,980
all pixelated shit.

572
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:08,760
They didn't stomp on Goombas and stuff.

573
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:13,400
Exactly. It's not retarded like that. But, of course, you know, Super Mario Bros. movie

574
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:17,620
came out when they were making these really strange sci-fi movies, you know, like Waterworld

575
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:23,000
and Judge Dredd and stuff. That was a whole other trend, but whatever.

576
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,840
I still have high hopes for Silent Hill. There's like one little publicity photo out right

577
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:31,920
now, which tells you nothing about the movie, but I have such high hopes for Silent Hill.

578
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:34,560
I really hope they're doing that right. And Halo sounds like it might actually be pretty

579
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,560
good, too. You never know.

580
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:39,360
I think Peter Jackson behind it is a great idea.

581
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:44,180
So there's some high hopes in 2006, or well I guess Halo will be more like 2007, but still.

582
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:48,280
Well it's also another thing too is they're making it from a property that people know

583
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:51,100
what it is instead of like Alone in the Dark.

584
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:54,060
Most people haven't played Alone in the Dark, I mean it's a game that came out a long-ass

585
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:58,740
time ago and House of the Dead, not many people have played House of the Dead.

586
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:00,740
Dungeon Siege is probably the biggest title out of three.

587
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:02,740
I've never played Dungeon Siege.

588
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:06,400
Well of course that's another thing where it's like well are you a PC gamer or a console

589
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,680
gamer because I think if you talk to more PC gamers, probably a lot of them have played

590
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:16,000
Dungeon Siege. I've played Dungeon Siege. It's Diablo, which I'm sure is very insulting

591
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,000
to some Dungeon Siege fans out there, but that was my reaction when I played it. I was

592
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,040
like, oh, it's Diablo by Microsoft.

593
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:27,040
Halo, it could be good. I mean, the premise is simple. Doom, the premise was simple, but

594
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,880
no.

595
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:33,680
Almost too simple. I would have rather seen them do a Duke Nukem movie than a Doom.

596
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:34,920
Duke Nukem would be badass.

597
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:39,760
Well, anyway, before we get on that tangent, we're going to talk about Hitman.

598
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,760
It's going to be coming up.

599
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:43,520
Vin Diesel is going to be starring in this film.

600
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,520
It should be interesting.

601
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,960
The director has been named.

602
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:53,080
It is Skip Woods who directed a movie Thursday, and maybe another movie that a lot of nerds

603
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,080
seem to like, Swordfish.

604
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:56,080
Swordfish was fucking badass.

605
00:35:56,080 --> 00:36:00,400
So maybe there's hope for Hitman, but I'm not a Vin Diesel fan.

606
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,800
I'm a fan of Swordfish, though.

607
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:07,120
That movie basically said, I'm going to kick your ass at the very beginning of the movie

608
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,120
and I did that.

609
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,120
It was awesome.

610
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,960
I saw like half of it.

611
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,100
It was a great movie.

612
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:18,520
The whole movie was just the villain winning and that was the best part of the whole movie.

613
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:21,200
Alright, no more stories from you, Logie?

614
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,240
Well, I got a couple things about the PSP.

615
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:24,240
Sure, what's up?

616
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,240
Homebrew stuff.

617
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:27,320
The first being that there's a game coming out.

618
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:32,280
It's supposed to be released, I believe in December, DJ Max.

619
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:37,040
are fans of the music gaming stuff. It's like BeatMania. It's actually an online game right

620
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:42,180
now. It's Korean. Basically, music gaming over the internet. Kind of like that O2 Jam

621
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:49,560
as well. Just a really cool music game. They've got pictures out on the website now. They're

622
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:54,480
also on PSP updates, which is pretty cool. The other thing for music gaming fans is this

623
00:36:54,480 --> 00:37:01,360
game called Button Mashing Revolution. That's when you play DDR on a controller. Yeah, DDR

624
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:08,360
a controller. They have it for a PSP. You can go download it on PSPupdates.com as well.

625
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,600
Another interesting thing I saw is they have a Pac-Man Racing...

626
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:16,600
Wait, wait. Does it have Butterfly? I don't know. They have Pac-Man World Rally,

627
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:20,160
which is going to be coming out here pretty soon. They'll probably compete with the Mario

628
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:23,520
Kart game. Now, that looks kind of cool. From the screenshots

629
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,880
you get of it, that looks kind of cool. It looks pretty cool.

630
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:32,400
I hope it's not as shitty as the Crash Bandicoot racing game, though, because, man, those Crash

631
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,120
Bandicoot spin-offs were god-awful.

632
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:38,840
The Mario Party wannabe game was god-awful, and the racing game was god-awful.

633
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,560
They have a new Crash Tag Team Racing game.

634
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,880
I'm done with Crash Bandicoot.

635
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:42,880
I really am.

636
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:43,880
Tag Team Racing?

637
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:46,240
That sounds like, I don't know, Mario Kart Double Dash?

638
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,880
Sorry, I'm...

639
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:48,880
My faith in the Crash Bandicoot series went out before.

640
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,740
You want to hear what they did for this one?

641
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:53,840
They made it a platform game and a racing game, so you can get out of your car and do

642
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:54,840
platform stuff.

643
00:37:54,840 --> 00:38:00,440
but it's a racing game. Would you lose the race if you got out of your car to lay spikes

644
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:05,240
down maybe or something? I forget. Alright, sorry, you're in Pac-Man World. Pac-Man World

645
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:11,340
Race, or World Rally. Wait, wait, wait, wait. This is weird, because isn't there that Mario

646
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:16,480
Kart arcade game coming out? Aren't there supposed to be Namco characters in that game?

647
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:20,020
Yeah, there are. Because Namco is a part of that whole Triforce thing that did the F-Zero

648
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:26,900
Ah, there is. So that's weird because if this is coming out to compete with Mario Kart...

649
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:28,160
Okay, I got a headache. Forget it.

650
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,260
You see where I'm going with this, though, right?

651
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:36,620
I see where you're going with this, but yeah. Well, it'll be cool, but it's just, you know,

652
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:39,620
what can I say?

653
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:43,660
The other thing that they ported was Quake 2 this week. They've done a new port of that

654
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:46,340
and that's pretty awesome, but I'm not a huge Quake fan, so...

655
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:47,940
Oh, I'm going to check it out. I like Quake.

656
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:48,940
But Quake 2, I mean...

657
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:51,700
By the first Quake, though, I'm still a purist for the first Quake.

658
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:57,540
Yeah, well, they have Quake II, or Quake I available right now, and that's pretty awesome,

659
00:38:57,540 --> 00:39:02,060
and Quake II is just going to be even more awesome.

660
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:03,780
I kind of skipped over Quake II.

661
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:07,100
I played a lot of Quake I, played a lot of Quake III, didn't play a lot of Quake II.

662
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:08,100
I don't know.

663
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:10,540
I'm just weird like that.

664
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:12,060
Last story of the night, guys.

665
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:17,500
Hideo Kojima has a blog out there, and it's been out there for a little while on the Kojima

666
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:21,220
Productions website but now it's in English so you can kind of check out

667
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:23,620
some of the things he talks about in his blog. What's kind of interesting he

668
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:26,820
doesn't just talk about games I mean he talked about you know directing

669
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:29,700
Metal Gear Solid 4 and he's talked about you know some personal things but he

670
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:32,460
talks about kind of random things as well I thought this was an interesting

671
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:37,060
quote what he said about Charlie and the Chocolate Factory the movie. I regret

672
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:40,500
that today's children may identify more with the four children before they

673
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:44,660
identify with Charlie. Our children live with the prospects of a gloomy dark and

674
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:49,220
uncertain future. Our materialistic society disallows children the chance to become like

675
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:53,780
Charlie because of the priorities placed on the fulfillment of desires, the pressure of

676
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:58,420
entrance examinations, and other forms of competition. Yes, they are forbidden any means

677
00:39:58,420 --> 00:39:59,580
of becoming like Charlie."

678
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:02,820
Interesting quote.

679
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:08,540
I know I aspire to be Veruca Salt, I don't know about you, but forget it.

680
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:16,340
Finally, I've got SQ Stare, you might remember him, he's the guy that's working on hacking

681
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:19,620
the Wi-Fi in the DS.

682
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:28,700
He's closing in on the bounty, which stands right now at $2,694.15, but he's pretty much

683
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:35,780
almost 100% done with everything. Just a few more things to work on, but pretty soon they're

684
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:40,860
going to be hacking that and God knows what that's going to bring. But I hear some pretty

685
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:43,680
cool things are going to be coming out for the DS and the Revolution. I know they're

686
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:48,140
talking about a new Mario Paint. Cool. Oh, like a Mario Paint with a Revolution would

687
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:52,420
be cool with that controller. Mario Paint with Revolution and imagine Wi-Fi with the

688
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:58,340
DS. Be able to post your picture chat on HD. That's great. That's beautiful.

689
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:00,340
So we'll just have to look forward to that.

690
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:01,340
Okay, sounds good.

691
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:04,460
All right, final thoughts, your final thought.

692
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:07,940
I'm going to have to try maybe picking up Metroid Pinball this week because I want to

693
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:09,260
see about that Rumble Pak thing.

694
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:10,260
That might be interesting.

695
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:11,580
Oh man, too many games to buy.

696
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:13,620
My final thought is there's too many games to buy.

697
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:15,540
We're getting in that month now where I'm going to be broke.

698
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:17,500
Oh wait, the Christmas season now.

699
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:18,500
I'm going to die.

700
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:20,620
November is like 50 billion games.

701
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:22,500
It's going to be a fun month for us though with this show.

702
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:25,260
So you've got to get a lot of free games.

703
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:28,960
In fact, speaking of which, I'm going to be reviewing next week on the program Midway

704
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:32,440
Arcade Treasures 3, which I'm looking forward to checking out.

705
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:33,440
What?

706
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,440
Supports HD.

707
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,440
Does it?

708
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,440
Yes.

709
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:38,780
Oh, the Midway 2 did too, so awesome.

710
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:43,180
I am so looking forward to playing Iron Man's Off-Road, which I believe is in here, yes?

711
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:44,180
Yes.

712
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:45,180
Super Off-Road, yes.

713
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:48,180
And Off-Road Thunder, which is awesome, and Hydro Thunder.

714
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:49,180
Loved Off-Road.

715
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:52,340
Rush to Rock, Rush 2049.

716
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:55,420
You know, when I first read about this game, I wasn't that excited about it because I was

717
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:57,820
like, oh, it's just a bunch of, you know, racing games.

718
00:41:57,820 --> 00:42:02,180
But they are really good racing games, so I think I'll have fun with it.

719
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:03,980
I'll let you guys know next week on the show.

720
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:07,780
So anyway, my final thought is, of course, you know, too many games to buy, but we do

721
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:12,780
have one final, final, final thought, and of course, Orange Launch Radio started as

722
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:17,340
a music, you know, gaming station and we were dedicated to those music and game fusion games

723
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:20,340
like Prappa the Rappa and DDR.

724
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:26,360
In DDR there's been a musician in several of the Dance Dance Revolution games who anybody

725
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:30,380
who's really into the Dance Dance Revolution games knows and really respects, and that's

726
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:31,380
Captain Jack.

727
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:36,620
Captain Jack passed away this week at the age of 43 of a stroke, he was in a coma earlier

728
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:38,780
this week and then finally passed away.

729
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:42,700
Captain Jack you would know because he always was in the uniform surrounded by hot ass women

730
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:44,540
basically.

731
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:47,380
Captain Jack was just all about fun music.

732
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:50,100
His music was not going to win any Grammys.

733
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:53,780
It was not going to be critically acclaimed.

734
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:59,460
It was just about fun and getting stuck in your head with those little March songs.

735
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:02,320
That's what DDR is all about because a lot of people when they get into DDR, they go

736
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:06,060
play it and then they run home and they burn a CD of all the DDR songs and listen to it

737
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:08,260
in their car and show all their friends and stuff.

738
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:11,100
Captain Jack is just a part of that.

739
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:16,340
The dance game community and really the music community as a whole lost somebody really

740
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:17,340
awesome this week.

741
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:21,020
So we wanted to dedicate tonight's episode to Captain Jack and although we don't normally

742
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:25,140
play music on the podcast, we felt tonight it would be appropriate to play a little clip

743
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:27,940
of you guys, of Captain Jack with Together in Forever.

744
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:29,740
So we're going to close out with this tonight.

745
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:31,580
Have a great week and we'll see you next week.

746
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:02,740
Together, forever, we're all for one

747
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:06,740
Together, forever, come and set me free

748
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:09,740
Set me free tonight

749
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:12,740
Baby, let me be your guide

750
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:15,740
Ooh, set me free tonight

751
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:18,740
Take your way too fast

752
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:30,460
That's the end of another Orange Lounge Radio To Go edition.

753
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:37,340
This podcast is a proud part of www.orangeloungeradio.com See you next update!
