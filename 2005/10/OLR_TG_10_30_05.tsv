249	13979	Hello out there to everybody who's downloading us and checking out the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, our podcast dedicated to video games and gaming podcasts.
29264	32747	and news that doesn't suck about these so-called video games.
33908	36530	We are here every week for your listening pleasure.
37430	38651	Happy Halloween to you guys.
39752	42414	Those of you guys that are downloading this on Monday, the day it comes out.
43475	45797	If you're downloading this later in the week, I hope you had a good Halloween.
46417	48117	My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky.
48437	51658	Not joining us tonight is DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
51678	57540	She planned on being here, but she had a last minute thing she had to go take care of, so unfortunately she wasn't able to be here for the recording.
57560	59400	That's two weeks in a row now, though, we're counting.
60060	60580	Shame, shame.
60620	61080	Shame, shame.
61120	64841	No, she says hi, and she'll be back next week, I'm sure.
65601	68682	However, we do have, as always, the one and only Techmaster Loki.
68902	69742	Yep, I'm here.
70002	70423	How you doing?
70783	70963	Good.
71563	72143	Good, good to hear.
73089	73369	All right.
74370	75270	Well, let's just get into it.
75310	76891	Let's talk about the games we've been playing this week.
76931	80614	That's usually how we like to start off the show, by letting you guys know what's going on in our gaming world.
81034	87998	And I noticed some of the posts on the forums say, damn, you guys like to play a lot of games, or you guys really seem to play a lot of games.
88499	90680	How is it that we're able to play so many games, Loki?
90700	91221	What do you think?
91441	94423	I don't think I play that many games, honestly, but... I don't.
94623	96884	I mean, I play like one game a week, usually.
97084	97585	And usually...
98445	100086	You'll notice, like, for example, Burnout.
100406	106108	I'll play it at a month at a time, and then I'll get snippets of games I'll play for like an hour or something just to try them out.
106668	107309	That type of thing.
107909	110930	And, of course, you know, things are kind of going the same pattern now.
111130	118173	It's going to get a little crazy in a couple weeks when the 360 comes out because I've got four games on order, so that'll be a little interesting.
118533	119433	I don't know how I do it.
119833	123394	There's so much coming out right now that I seem to be buying at least one new game a week.
123414	124634	And that's buying, kids.
124734	126314	I don't get a lot of this stuff for free.
126334	131755	I did get one free game thanks to Loki this week, but we don't really get the hookup or anything, so we actually buy these games.
132575	136056	I get a lot of games for free, but I don't play them, to be honest.
136076	137336	I just got Castlevania DS.
137796	139077	I want to play that because it looks good.
140217	142637	And I got some more Dance Dance Revolution Extreme 2.
143657	147258	But they had Wallace and Gromit, Curse the Were-Rabbit, and I was like, eh, no.
148092	148892	I'm not going to play that game.
149012	150813	Usually games based on movies aren't all that great.
150833	151153	I don't know.
151173	151793	There's some good ones.
152054	154514	I can bring one in and give it away or something.
154574	154935	I don't know.
154995	156235	Yeah, listeners will like that.
156895	159997	So I don't get a chance to... I picked up a couple games.
160017	165999	I picked up Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories and I played it for like five minutes.
166399	171621	Usually Grand Theft Auto I'm just like getting right into it and it's like, oh man, you know, I have to play this game but
172899	173921	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
186304	190365	I was just about to ask you how your gaming week was, but I suppose that's a big part of it there, is the Liberty City.
205209	211310	I don't have enough time to dedicate to Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories because that's a game that requires a lot of time.
211770	212991	Same with San Andreas.
213031	214171	I didn't even finish that game.
214691	216812	I just didn't have enough time to dedicate to it.
216972	218312	I got bored with it after a while.
218332	221032	Once in a while, there's a great game, though, where you make time for it.
221293	222033	Yeah, exactly.
222833	224533	And that great game is The Warriors.
225013	226054	I love that game.
226414	227774	So that's what you've been playing instead.
227894	231855	I've been playing The Warriors this week, and I have to say Rockstar has really...
233673	237316	They really did a really good job translating the movie into a game.
237676	240698	And it's really surprising because I think this...
241414	242075	Game of Thrones
265316	292274	and just really fun stuff like one of the things I like most about it is this kind of a rumble mode type thing where you go in and do like quick fights and as you go through the game you unlock more fights so it starts off with one-on-one and then war party which is five-on-five and then I just unlocked one that's called arming which is nine-on-nine and it keeps going on with that you unlock more arenas that you can fight in and unlock more gangs and stuff
292774	294155	and overall, the game's really fun.
294215	296117	You can pick up objects and stuff.
296177	301262	I was mugging a guy and I threw a trash can in his head or threw a police officer through a window.
301302	302403	I mean, it's just really fun.
303163	304785	Alright, cool.
305125	305846	Fun's what it's all about.
306506	306826	Is that it?
307427	308488	That's all I've been playing.
308688	310950	I still haven't gotten a chance to play Shadow of Colossus yet.
311230	311911	It's
313276	319519	I've been dying to check out that game because our forums have been very active about this game and lit up, and I've heard a lot of great things about it.
319539	322661	So I'm hoping that that can be on my list for next week, but we'll see.
323502	324503	It's going to be a busy November.
325783	327805	Well, we have Battlefront 2 coming out this week.
328425	329326	Actually, tomorrow.
330226	331547	Or, no, I should say the first.
332708	335950	So there's a lot of stuff, and that's going to be a really awesome game.
336390	336490	Yep.
337379	339061	My gaming week, I played a couple games this week.
339081	341142	I actually played three games, so I'm going to review two of them for you.
341182	359417	The one I did not play so much of this week, I bought this, but I haven't really sat down to any extent with this, and that's the Taito collection that's come out recently with Bubble Bobble and Rainbow Islands and Elevator Action and Rastan and all these old kicks and all these old, old games.
359877	362379	And of course Space Invaders is on there too.
362399	370203	So I'm going to review that on next week's show because I didn't get to play it enough this week because I was too busy with other games, one of them being Soul Calibur 3.
371164	373005	Soul Calibur 3 I picked up this week on a whim.
374326	377127	Soul Calibur 3 is pretty hot, I gotta say.
377447	382110	At first my reaction to Soul Calibur 3 was, this is really more like Soul Calibur 2.5.
382450	384912	It doesn't really feel like...
385592	386313	DarkSakura
407569	414594	Challenge Mode, I don't remember the official, Soul Battle or something where you just, you do these different types like Deathmatch or coin collecting, these weird modes.
414934	437209	But I gotta say, this one mode that really I thought was just so fascinating was the Chronicles of the Sword mode, which is this mode that suddenly Soul Calibur turns into this tactical game where you're moving your characters around trying to capture castles, and when you get into battles, you can actually zoom to the battle and actually have a real Soul Calibur style match, which I thought was a very interesting addition to the game.
437749	446811	and you kind of consider that Soul Calibur has kind of been going outside the box for a little while now because they had that mode in Soul Calibur 2 and then the conquest mode in the arcades.
447171	447971	It was really cool.
448471	452132	I'm trying to make it much more than just a fighting game and I think that's really great.
453212	457953	Now, if you are not a fan of fighting games, is Soul Calibur 3 going to have anything new to win you over?
458473	459433	Probably not.
459633	464014	I don't think if you're a fighting games person, Soul Calibur 3 is going to have anything really for you.
464314	466755	And I think if you're not a fan of the Soul Calibur series to begin with,
467651	467931	and so on.
487781	488942	and so on and so forth.
511340	512701	But then he designed the outfits.
512901	517984	So it's more like you're playing Barbie, Soul Calibur Barbie style, where you're choosing the different outfits and the color for the outfits.
518404	520525	But you can still do an awful lot with that.
520585	521526	And it's kind of cool.
521566	522646	And it makes you laugh.
522666	526609	Because we made this one character that doesn't wear pants, but he wears a giant Pope hat.
527830	529631	Style Thing, and he's a ninja.
530072	531033	And it's really funny.
531874	533255	And we gave him like the old man.
533536	535678	Yes, he's a pantsless pope ninja, and he's awesome.
536298	539582	So, you know, you can have fun with it.
539922	540603	It's a cute idea.
542748	543649	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
563884	564645	I think it's kind of neat.
565265	567367	So I do recommend Soul Calibur 3.
567607	569169	I think it's a very solid, great game.
569629	574813	Honestly, if you're a fan of Soul Calibur, you probably already have this game, and if you don't already have it, you need to go get it.
574873	580578	Because if you remotely enjoyed the previous Soul Calibur games, especially Soul Calibur 2, you will enjoy Soul Calibur 3.
581018	583280	I'm just a little upset that they didn't put it in the arcades.
583340	584721	I think it would have been a great arcade game.
585041	585602	But maybe...
586122	597810	Because all the new stuff is very centered around the single player mode, I think if you take just the versus mode without creating a character, there's really not a whole lot different from Soul Calibur 2, save three new characters and some backgrounds.
598350	607596	So, I think it is something that, now having played it on the console, I think this is something that they really, you know, there would be no point porting it to the arcade, but...
608376	611678	I don't know, I'm just a little disappointed to see that it didn't continue in the arcade.
612438	619741	The other game I checked out this week was Midway Arcade Treasures Part 3 for the Xbox, was the system I played it on.
621602	636890	Eight racing games, including Stun Runner, Hydro Thunder, Offroad Thunder, that's what I'm thinking of, and then Iron Man's Offroad, but they took Iron Man out, and now it's just some regular guy, because I guess licensing ran up or whatever.
639429	651993	The reason why I was so drawn to this game and I was so excited to play this game was for Iron Man Off-Road because I have very fond memories of dumping a shitload of quarters into a pizzeria arcade machine and just playing this game over and over again.
652233	654754	And they even have the track pack one, which I think is awesome.
655154	658355	So I was loving it.
658475	658995	It's cool.
659115	660176	It's a retro trip.
660516	663237	I mean, you kind of know how you feel about those retro collections.
663277	666738	If you kind of find them a waste of money, then you're probably not going to get anything new out of this.
667278	667298	I
667538	679365	I was a little disappointed at first that it's nothing but the racing games, but when you consider that Midway's kind of already packaged all their other stuff and put it in Treasures 1 and 2, which were both very solid collections, this collection's, you know...
680565	682506	They made pretty good use out of what they got left.
682946	690129	Now, I was a little disappointed, though, because Hydro Thunder and Offroad Thunder do not appear to be arcade ports.
690490	692911	Or if they are, they sure don't play like them.
693011	694972	They feel very console-ish.
694992	696552	I think they're ports of the console versions.
696652	699734	I don't think they're ports of the arcade, which was a little bit disappointing.
699774	702415	And I don't know if maybe the hardware can handle it.
702435	703716	Well, it should be able to.
703756	704316	I mean, looking...
704895	706076	I remember the hardware versions.
706336	707777	I used to love Offroad Thunder.
707797	710459	That was my game to play at QZAR and stuff.
710980	712401	And it looked amazing.
712461	713221	It looked pretty good.
714622	715583	But yeah, I can imagine.
716204	718646	I don't think they're straight arcade ports.
718706	721848	Or if they are, they tweaked them so they don't really feel like the arcade.
721908	725591	So I was a little sad at that.
725691	728173	But it's still a pretty solid buy for $20.
728973	730735	If you like racing games, you're going to love this.
731375	742383	and it's in that same great interface that they have Part 2 in and I think they went back and updated Part 1 with but Part 2's got a great interface and 3 just kind of continues that.
742423	743664	If it's not broke, don't fix it.
743844	745926	Xbox Live Aware and all that good stuff if you're on Xbox.
747347	750368	So I would... I kind of borderline recommend it.
750528	755709	I think that Treasures 2 and Treasures 1 are more must-haves than Treasures 3.
756689	761610	But if you like these old retro collections, you definitely want to pick up Treasures 3.
761991	762751	It's a good buy for $20.
762951	763871	You can't go wrong.
764171	766952	So I give it kind of... If you're a retro fan, I recommend it.
767012	773933	If you're not so much a retro fan, I can only really give it a borderline recommendation because it's a very focused genre and it kind of gets old.
774594	775454	I think if you're not into it.
775834	775934	So...
776614	778856	All right, so those are two games, and then next week I'll talk about Taito.
779456	781038	Let's get into some gaming news, shall we?
781478	781638	Shall we.
781658	783399	We'll talk about some news going on.
784620	791525	Florida is going to follow the footsteps of California, supposedly, because a violent video game bill has been proposed in Florida now.
792006	794127	However, there's a little bit of a difference there.
795188	801213	Florida's proposal also includes violent arcade games and shop-selling arcade machines.
802344	806166	and not just the retail over-the-counter ones, which I think is very interesting.
806186	807727	Eh, that's retarded.
808487	808847	How so?
809748	814270	I mean, I can't sell this violent arcade game to a minor.
815451	816151	Is that what it's going to be?
816171	819653	I know, I guess, but what do you do about little kids walking into an arcade?
819713	827457	I mean, I don't think the bill is really set to cover that, but, I mean, Mortal Kombat, I saw it, like, you know, 15, and it was awesome.
827497	830539	It's not that violent, I mean, I don't know, it's...
831721	834363	You remember the big stink they raised about Mortal Kombat, though.
834383	839146	Yeah, and they never got it then and didn't get it now, so, I mean, it's just retarded.
839431	840372	We just thought we'd let you know.
868358	873862	and focus your energies on things like that because that's real violent, that kind of stuff.
875183	877805	Video games are cartoons compared to that movie.
878865	879946	I want to see that movie.
881627	892935	All kidding aside, obviously the issue is movies are rated R and you're warned about it and maybe he feels that video games aren't so well rated, although I seem to recall ratings on the bottom of every video game.
895157	895537	Seriously,
896958	900334	The movies can be way worse, you guys That's my opinion
901908	904770	Liberty City Stories, of course, Loki brought that up earlier in the show.
905071	910374	And you know that the custom soundtrack option is usually locked out, like you can't really get to it in the game.
910714	924323	However, Rockstar Games is now offering for download a Rockstar Custom Tracks program that will allow you to rip tracks off commercial music CDs and put them into your custom soundtracks for Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories.
924864	930227	So the interesting thing about this, though, is that it won't recognize stuff you bought off iTunes, which kind of sucks.
931749	934393	It will not rip music from CD-Rs.
934894	935334	Yes, it will.
936396	940583	Well, they say that you can't rip music from CD-Rs.
940703	943828	They say that you can't, but you can...
944692	954219	What people do is say either, like for example, if you have iTunes, burn a CD and you can either do it that way and burn a CD and then rip it that way.
954800	967289	Or if you have other tracks that won't rip for whatever reason, you use your CD burning software to create a disc image and you open that image in a program like Daemon Tools that creates a virtual CD-ROM and you can do it that way.
967850	968190	Wow.
969732	971413	That's a long way to go about doing it.
971573	977297	And the thing about the custom tracks, though, it's not like its own radio station like in the PC version or something.
978077	980639	You actually, it will play like a CD player.
980779	983381	So instead of switching stations, you're switching tracks.
984802	991386	So it's not like you get in a car and you can have your own custom station, which kind of sucks, but I don't know.
991426	991786	Interesting.
992489	1000054	Well, BlizzCon was going on this past weekend, and if you went to BlizzCon, I didn't, because I didn't really get into the Warcraft thing until just a couple weeks ago.
1000334	1002115	I'm not in the Warcraft thing, sir.
1002535	1006558	Well, I mean, it's not that I hadn't played Diablo 2 and Warcraft 2.
1006718	1008479	I never really did get into StarCraft, though.
1008519	1008799	I don't know.
1008839	1010761	I somehow just completely missed the boat on that one.
1011641	1013743	But as far as Warcraft 2 goes, I just sucked at it.
1014683	1015263	I sucked at it.
1015964	1019146	And Diablo, I played for a little while and then kind of gave up on.
1019486	1022009	So I'm just now kind of going back to the Blizzard stuff.
1023010	1025052	But of course, BlizzCon, very well attended.
1025112	1025793	Lots of people there.
1025853	1027194	Lots of stories from BlizzCon.
1027794	1032679	And they are saying that they are going to be testing a new game.
1032759	1039846	And if you use the, I guess, number on the back of your BlizzCon pass, you can go to a website and sign up to beta test a new game.
1040107	1041748	But they won't say what the game is.
1042709	1044671	Is it a new Diablo game?
1046112	1048534	Is it a WoW expansion or something?
1048814	1052357	Or is it possibly StarCraft Ghost?
1052417	1053998	Although I think that's already on its way.
1054399	1054979	So I don't know.
1055319	1056781	So we don't know what it's going to be.
1058402	1062005	But I imagine all those Blizzard fanboys and girls will be signing up in droves.
1064793	1072921	Anyway, also speaking of World of Warcraft, we definitely, definitely have to mention the Burning Crusade, the new expansion that was mentioned this week for World of Warcraft.
1073162	1074563	They're going to be upping the level cap to 70.
1075484	1085195	Two brand new playable races, Blood Elves on the Horde side, and although they won't say what it is on the Alliance side, we're hearing buzz that it's Pandarins, but...
1086095	1089577	I don't take that with a grain of salt, but Blood Elves is the for sure one.
1090638	1096482	Some new starting zones, and you can go through the Dark Portal, which is a reference to the Warcraft 2 expansions.
1097483	1102286	New flying mounts, you know, like instead of riding a horse, I guess they fly now.
1103206	1115815	And tons of new quests and tons of new items, and jewel crafting, a new profession, because you're going to have socketed items now, which is kind of something borrowed from Diablo, but if you think about it, World of Warcraft pretty much plays like a Diablo game.
1116355	1117236	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1138837	1140657	And that looks damn sexy.
1140717	1146139	You know, a lot of people panned the previous game, Enter the Matrix is what it's called.
1146219	1147239	I liked it.
1147399	1148639	I didn't think it was that bad.
1148759	1154360	I thought it was a really neat idea how they really made it a continuation of the movies.
1154740	1160562	And even if the movies 2 and 3 sucked, it was a neat continuation idea.
1160682	1162982	It really fused the whole movies and games thing.
1163022	1164302	I gotta give them a lot of credit for that.
1164542	1166463	And the game itself was not that bad.
1167003	1168004	It wasn't bad at all.
1168084	1169505	I thought it was kind of neat.
1169545	1170605	It was fun.
1170765	1171205	It was tough.
1172126	1175468	This one looks really badass, and the graphics really stepped it up a bit.
1176549	1177849	Anyways, that's not what I had.
1179931	1189356	The first thing I wanted to mention, actually, there's been a whole lot of, especially with the upcoming systems now, a whole bunch of speculation on dates and stuff.
1190797	1192658	One of the things that was reported this week is
1193300	1217798	and it's been confirmed by a couple places that the release for the revolution is going to be June 2006 which ties in both it's the end of or I should say the beginning of the new financial year for Nintendo and it's also been confirmed by some other hardware sources people are doing the chip manufacturing and stuff so that'll be interesting but the price point though is kind of up in the air
1218206	1218687	Zeldarevolution
1232967	1236868	Which is not even confirmed to be an actual game that's even in existence.
1237088	1246311	Even if it was in existence, they're not going to release it two months after... Oh my gosh, I'm so embarrassed I can't remember the name of the new Zelda game all of a sudden.
1247331	1248071	You mean Twilight Princess?
1248091	1249172	Yes, Twilight Princess.
1249232	1249752	Oh my god.
1251092	1252813	Oh, I just lost major nerd points there.
1253073	1255233	They're not going to release it two months after Twilight Princess.
1255273	1256154	Let's put it this way, okay?
1256534	1261095	First off, there is no Zelda Revolution, at least not anything that's coming out next year at all.
1262047	1268770	What it's going to be is going to be just Zelda Twilight Princess with Revolution support.
1268970	1273052	They're going to have added support added into the game, so if you have Revolution, you can do funky stuff and stuff.
1273212	1275894	Right, like the old Game Boy, Oracle Seasons and stuff.
1275994	1276894	Yeah, stuff like that.
1276934	1280316	Anyways, but what you can do is you can...
1281559	1285642	Actually pre-order some stuff with your Revolution in a bundle.
1285962	1290405	Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles, Mario Revolution, Metroid Prime 3, Super Smash Bros.
1290465	1291205	Revolution.
1292586	1293927	And you can reserve those for $240.
1294047	1300612	Which is interesting seeing as none of those games are even confirmed to exist.
1300672	1301672	I know, that's kind of weird.
1301692	1308457	That's like saying, I want to pre-order Grand Theft Auto V. But...
1309666	1313829	The other thing which was very interesting is the PlayStation 3.
1314449	1318352	And there's been a lot of, you know, when's this thing coming out too?
1319213	1322935	And now there's a rumor going around that's saying that it's not going to be until 2007.
1322995	1325737	No, they wouldn't.
1325797	1327738	That would be crazy.
1328059	1337545	2007 due to hardware failures because apparently the system, you know, a la normal PlayStation 2 and PlayStation, they get a little hot.
1339056	1339576	Wow.
1341017	1343557	That would really stink if they pushed that back to 2007.
1343817	1344738	That would be, oh.
1345058	1350599	Um, but of course this is, you know, a friend of, you know, I heard it from somebody who heard it from somebody.
1350619	1351800	Yeah, that's crap then.
1351880	1356581	So, yeah, very interesting stuff though.
1357413	1357673	XBOX 360 System
1384035	1384997	Not the core system.
1385537	1387900	And so they didn't really make that many to begin with.
1388000	1390964	And I don't think that they're... It's all based on pre-orders.
1391144	1396150	So these stores, you know, if they ordered that many core systems to come in, then that's what they're getting.
1396190	1398794	But it's not going to be like, we wanted to bring in some systems.
1399354	1400836	Here's some core systems instead.
1400856	1402198	Because, you know, that'd be like...
1403342	1408245	That'd be like going to your store, you know, and, oh, I'm going to be selling a bunch of Pentium 4 PCs.
1408485	1411726	Oh, sorry, we sent you Pentium 3 PCs, you know, deal.
1412227	1413987	So, it's not going to happen.
1414007	1422292	You know how I feel about pre-ordering, and I have this really hard idea believing that they would put off major retailers like Toys R Us and Best Buy by shafting them with just the $300.
1422852	1425773	Best Buy is only getting about $50 per store.
1426334	1426854	That is it.
1427074	1430496	So, you're going to have some major trouble finding one launch day.
1430516	1430676	Yeah.
1431978	1439323	I really am saying it's going to be short handed and as it is, eBay, they're already up to $480 to $600 for guaranteed getting them on launch day pre-books.
1446129	1446569	Crazy.
1446949	1447309	Crazy.
1448590	1450091	I'm going to be pissed if that happens.
1450651	1451051	Watch me.
1451131	1452231	I will rant on this program.
1453012	1453272	Anyway.
1455252	1455953	I better get mine.
1456393	1457693	It's paid for completely.
1458053	1459054	All right.
1460614	1460955	Moving on.
1460995	1464536	Let's go to the mailbox because I went ahead and opened up the mailbox this week.
1464576	1473959	I know this is usually DarkSakura's task, but she gave me permission to open up the mailbox this week, read some emails sent at togo at orangelaunchradio.com is our mailbox.
1474440	1475320	So let's open up the mailbag.
1477074	1477815	and see what's going on.
1480138	1483361	We have an email from Dallas who actually lives in Salt Lake City.
1484483	1494751	Dallas wrote us to tell us that they were listening to the last podcast and we mentioned about the congressional bill about how all TVs must be digital or TV stations need to be broadcast only in digital by 2008.
1496693	1499735	Digital is not the same as HD is what Dallas wants to clarify.
1500035	1504099	So all TVs by 2008 need to be able to receive a digital signal.
1504419	1508062	It doesn't mean that TVs need to receive an HD signal which is completely different.
1508622	1512484	and basically any TV can receive a digital signal with a converter from RadioShack.
1512824	1515745	And if you already get digital cable or satellite, then you're already set.
1516086	1521768	In fact, all current game consoles are digital, so all next-gen consoles will be digital as well.
1522348	1525690	But it seems only the 360 and PS3 will have HD capabilities.
1526230	1527731	HD is a completely different monster.
1528111	1533153	I used to have this misperception with digital and HD was the same thing, and I think many people have the same misperception.
1533473	1534794	Hope that clarifies things.
1535393	1537253	I thought they were broadcasting in HD.
1537293	1538694	I thought everything was going in HD.
1539254	1541174	I was under that misimpression too.
1541554	1544975	It wasn't so much that I misunderstood that there was a difference between digital and HD.
1545455	1548476	I thought that the bill was telling them they'd have to do HD.
1548596	1551796	I thought it was supposed to be HD because everything is going into that format now.
1552057	1553317	It's going to be all widescreen.
1553357	1554697	It's what everything is going into.
1555377	1558718	And that's why newer TVs can't support that.
1558758	1563439	But hey, more power to you if it's just digital.
1564147	1564688	DarkSakura.com
1585511	1586012	Good luck with that.
1586332	1587453	Alright, let's go to another email.
1587473	1590496	This is from one of our serial emailers, Rob.
1591156	1591697	But we like him.
1591717	1592838	He always has a lot of good stuff to say.
1592878	1597041	He wants to give us a useless bit of trivia for the game Grip Shift.
1597442	1601966	There's actually an Easter egg if you watch the credits of Grip Shift all the way through.
1602726	1604348	You get a recipe at the end.
1605048	1605829	That's kind of cool.
1606710	1607590	What's the recipe for?
1608231	1610353	It didn't say in the email, but I think it's on our forums.
1610553	1611694	So go check out the forums.
1613546	1613867	All right.
1614507	1616489	And last up, we got an email from Polly.
1616509	1620132	And this actually relates to something that's going on in the news right now.
1620732	1629219	The Ultramix 3 and Xtreme 2 and Karaoke Revolution Tour, the DDR and Karaoke Revolution Tour that's going on in some of the malls.
1630500	1635925	Polly wrote us because he wants to say that he actually went and wants to describe the setup a little bit.
1636205	1640048	It was a small stage set up with DDR Xtreme 2 set up southwest of the stage.
1640376	1642759	and Ultramix 3 set up Southeast.
1643279	1646322	Unfortunately, they didn't have metal pads, just the official sticky pads.
1646763	1649065	EX2 and Ultramix 3 have a bunch of new songs.
1649425	1657314	Although Extreme 2 seems to stick to the DDR feel and Ultramix 3 seems to have a bigger variety to me, both seem like good games to get for DDR Bomani fans.
1657674	1661438	The stage itself had a single soft pad and kiosk for Karaoke Revolution.
1661638	1662058	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1691198	1692199	Hmm, very interesting.
1692819	1706205	Also says at the end here, but for the lucky people in Illinois, Massachusetts, and New Jersey areas where this tour is going next, I say go to this event for some free DDR stuff, a chance to win $5,000, and to help those no-energy workers promote buhani games.
1707406	1708967	Sounds like fun, so check that out.
1709007	1718011	If you happen to live in Massachusetts, Illinois, or New Jersey, the tour is on its way to you, so go check it out if you're into the music games, which we are here at Orange Love Radio.
1719909	1721309	That's going to do it for the mailbox tonight.
1721870	1726751	2go at orangeloungeradio.com is the email address if you ever want to send us any feedback, comments, or questions on the show.
1727211	1730833	Also check out the olrpsp.com site.
1731173	1736174	We just added a brand new way to communicate with us via the shout line.
1736194	1736794	Shout out!
1737055	1742896	It's a shout line and a wonderful shout box that I worked so very hard on.
1743417	1744397	It's there for fun.
1744937	1747778	Post your thoughts, your feelings, or just play with it.
1748479	1748859	Have fun.
1748879	1750440	But don't spam it or we'll kill you.
1750921	1751301	That's all right.
1751341	1752682	We can ban you.
1753022	1753582	We'll ban you.
1753602	1754603	We'll ban you.
1754703	1756704	Just like we're the moderators of Ragnarok Online.
1756824	1757405	We ban you.
1758786	1761307	Anyway, check that out.
1761387	1765010	And olrpsp.com, again, is really meant for your PSP.
1765330	1769653	I mean, you can bring it up in Internet Explorer or Firefox, but it's just not as cool.
1770273	1770634	Trust me.
1770754	1771674	Bring it up on your PSP.
1771734	1772675	It's awesome looking.
1774249	1774750	It Got Cancelled!
1792011	1796155	The whole damn thing got canceled, except for, well, they do, you know, a couple shows.
1796495	1810128	They ended up doing the shows in, I think, Spokane and Vancouver, but they canceled all the rest, or at least, you know, they say, well, they kind of may be postponing them to 2006, but long story short, you got to go back, get your tickets refunded, and guess what?
1810368	1813351	That Ticketmaster handling fee, non-refundable.
1814312	1815233	You got screwed out of 450.
1818704	1832139	I think this is really weird, though, because I seem to remember that they made this big hubbaloo about postponing the dates, and I bet if we went in the older podcasts, we'd find where we were talking about this, even, where they were adding more dates because of demand.
1832600	1834842	And now they're saying they're canceling them because...
1835763	1840485	They thought more people would be supportive of the concept and there just wasn't enough interest generated in these shows.
1840686	1843727	I think they really underestimated how much people hate Tommy Tarling.
1844607	1845368	You're mean.
1849650	1855393	I was turned off by the fact they said they were going to play music from Pong and Donkey Kong and I'm sitting here going, what?
1856093	1857734	There's no music in Pong?
1858094	1860475	It was supposed to be inspired by Pong.
1860796	1861396	That's crap.
1863156	1863536	Boop!
1863637	1866618	That's a bunch of... Maybe I'm just reading rumors or something.
1866638	1868860	I don't want to get quoted or nasty emails and stuff.
1868880	1873683	But seriously, they were talking about playing music from these old, old, old 80s games that had no music.
1873723	1875904	I know that Donkey Kong or something was on there.
1876244	1877085	And I'm just thinking, what?
1877985	1884009	Some of the other stuff might have been cool, like Metal Gear Solid and stuff, but I bet Squeenix is pointing and laughing going, uh-huh.
1885009	1886550	Dear Friends was a big success.
1886791	1887131	Uh-huh.
1888231	1890473	More Friends plagued with sound problems and
1891411	1897696	Got panned by the video game community because we didn't know how to put on a show at the Hollywood Amphitheater or wherever the hell that thing was we went to.
1898137	1901660	Universal thing, but at least that place was sold out.
1904802	1906483	With their exploding soundboard.
1906844	1914630	Yeah, you know, it was so cool because they'd have like the one-winged angel and out come the black mages, you know.
1914670	1919134	And then, like this random wood thing falling.
1919734	1920335	That was awful.
1921089	1923351	I have full faith in him now.
1923371	1923831	Jason X was awesome.
1948755	1953677	No granted though, if anyone's going to pull off a Jason in Space movie, it would be him, I guess.
1955058	1959619	Uwe Boll is going to split the Dungeon Siege movie, Kill Bill style.
1960860	1961520	Very interesting.
1961720	1965242	This movie's going to be like four hours long, so they're splitting it into two parts.
1965422	1968263	You want to know how long originally this movie's supposed to be?
1969183	1973745	He said that it was basically the original script...
1974227	1979150	And the script that he apparently is going by right now is 485 pages long.
1979290	1982572	So, um... Excuse me, hold on.
1982592	1983513	Lord of the Rings ripoff!
1984793	1986514	Okay, 485 pages long.
1986975	1989756	And you know in script writing, each page is supposed to be about a minute.
1989776	1991678	That would be an 8 hour long movie.
1992198	1992878	Oh my god.
1993599	1993799	So...
1994904	2000709	I guess the first part is going to be called In the Name of the King, and it will be out November 3rd, 2006.
2001769	2003951	But then the conclusion will be out December 1st, 2006.
2004091	2007494	So it's going to be like one month in between.
2007954	2013298	I'm willing to give it a chance, but I'm kind of like, is this only getting made because of Lord of the Rings?
2013719	2016200	Is it going to be a subpar clone?
2016240	2017421	Was it BloodRayne?
2017642	2020384	The reviews for it have been horrible.
2020764	2021124	Horrible.
2021164	2021805	Horrible.
2023117	2025318	StarShipTroopers is being turned into a PC game.
2045945	2057409	So, in 2000, I guess in 2000 they had a first Starship Troopers-based game, but this is a new one that is basically doing a first-person perspective type thing.
2059510	2059890	Interesting.
2060250	2064212	Casper Van Diem, by the way, who was in the film, will be doing voiceover commentary in the game.
2064332	2065252	Because he doesn't get any work.
2065512	2065893	That's right.
2067933	2069074	Any other news for us, Loki?
2069974	2070954	Oh, let me see.
2071014	2073876	Yeah, I know, of course, there's stuff.
2074376	2075076	The first being...
2077426	2078686	Stuff for the PSP, of course.
2079306	2088428	The big thing that everybody's been, you know, up in arms about is the brand new, actually, well, for example, SOCOM.
2088548	2105531	They have voice chat in it, so now they are going to be offering, pretty soon, a headset for chatting on, you know, via the game over, you know, the internet, just like you would with anybody else playing, you know, SOCOM on your PS2 or whatnot.
2106286	2108888	So that's going to be coming out pretty soon, which is kind of cool.
2110569	2119516	The other thing was, they were talking about a little bit on the Resident Evil DS stuff, which looks really weird.
2121278	2128804	I'm always kind of concerned with the quirky gameplay of the DS with Resident Evil.
2128824	2129144	I don't know.
2130476	2131297	I'm just not seeing it.
2131917	2134219	Resident Evil Deadly Silence.
2134959	2136500	Damn you people and your DS.
2138462	2145626	God, every freaking franchise that's gone over to DS had to be like, you know, Drill Spirits or Dawn of Sorrow.
2145646	2147448	It's like, God, we get it.
2147608	2148568	It's a DS game.
2151250	2155713	It's coming out, by the way, in mid-January in Japan, but I'm sure we'll get it here.
2156314	2156694	Of course.
2158100	2159781	Don't wanna end up in a Jill's sandwich.
2176906	2179867	I don't think that'd be so bad.
2180527	2195974	Anyways, really, the other big thing that was coming out, actually, is the add-on for Half-Life 2, Lost Coast, and it's actually available now via Steam, which is definitely the way you can download it.
2195994	2202016	It supposedly has some graphical updates to it, new volumetric lighting, and just the
2202685	2206727	Overall, Half-Life 2 is sexy, so that's all you really need to know.
2206787	2213910	The other big thing, actually, if games are coming out, would be THQ's lineup for the 360.
2214771	2221834	And everybody's looking forward to Saints Row, which is supposed to be one of the Grand Theft Auto games now for the 360.
2222383	2223864	Oh yeah, another one.
2224164	2224944	You know what?
2243041	2246504	Why am I getting so upset about not being able to get an Xbox 360 on launch day?
2246524	2248366	Because there's going to be no freaking games out.
2248546	2250408	All your launch titles are coming out in November.
2251329	2254191	You're not going to be seeing anything new until January.
2254252	2257555	And so far, everything that's been announced for January, The Godfather...
2258294	2267521	which is one of the games that's coming out, and I believe there was another game that was pushed back to that date, NBA, or College Hoops, 2006.
2267561	2273286	Didn't the Elder Scrolls one get... Elder Scrolls is in December, the first week in December.
2273306	2274527	Okay, so we do get a December game.
2274687	2281713	Yeah, it's going to be awesome, but, you know, it's really sad that this is everything that's coming out.
2281733	2284655	It's going to be, you know, DSPSP syndrome, you know, where
2285148	2288589	The system launches with a ton of titles and you're like, okay, wow, all those games are cool.
2288949	2289769	What do you got for me next?
2290609	2291190	We got nothing.
2292250	2295791	Maybe now I'm starting to reconsider if I really need to buy into this hype on the launch.
2295811	2296831	It's only by second wave.
2296891	2299612	It's coming out first, second week in January.
2300932	2302192	That's when you can get your 360.
2303273	2303833	I'll think about it.
2304033	2304453	I'll think about it.
2305544	2306824	News on Final Fantasy 3DS
2328570	2334155	Final Fantasy 3 used some complicated programming techniques that really couldn't be ported to a handheld gaming machine until now.
2335216	2340420	So what they did is, since it went so long without an upgrade, they decided to do some graphical upgrades for Final Fantasy 3.
2341080	2345144	Not to be confused, you guys, with the American Final Fantasy 3, which was actually Final Fantasy 6.
2346165	2350168	They're going to remake the Japanese Final Fantasy 3 and call it Final Fantasy 3 on the DS.
2350488	2353251	It's going to have sort of 3D graphics.
2353971	2360936	It's going to be virtual 3D graphics, so you can't really rotate the maps on demand or anything, but you can still zoom in and out and stuff.
2361216	2366620	And they're going to redo the characters and some of the technology, and they will incorporate a little bit of touchscreen into it.
2367000	2370103	Think 3D as in Final Fantasy VII.
2371546	2376490	Also, in the original Nintendo one, the four main characters really didn't have any personalities.
2376850	2381974	But in the DS remake, they are going to get some new personalities that are going to impact the storyline.
2382255	2385357	So it's basically going to be this whole new game, it sounds like.
2386058	2387919	So, it should be fun.
2388279	2388560	Awesome.
2389360	2390261	I'm definitely going to pick that up.
2390721	2392783	Also, I've got to say this one more.
2393504	2395966	There will be wireless capability.
2398933	2403197	They won't say how, but it's going to use the wireless capability for some sort of bonus.
2404438	2404858	Interesting.
2405098	2405338	Cool.
2406079	2408041	Couple last news stories for you guys tonight.
2408561	2409862	Unless you have anything else, Loki?
2409902	2411323	I have stuff, of course.
2412004	2415047	Then finish up, because all I've got left is the funny stuff.
2415207	2415847	Okay, okay.
2415907	2418509	Well, the first thing I've got, and this is kind of cool.
2419731	2423614	If you're a fan of playing the old arcade games and you...
2424226	2425247	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2448176	2450097	And that's pretty interesting.
2450858	2452059	You know what, kids?
2452199	2454642	Just spend $40 on Arcade Treasures 1 and 2.
2455282	2456583	Or spend $60 and get 1, 2, and 3.
2457004	2464791	And just tilt your TV a little bit and maybe spend another $20 on an arcade-style joystick and you're set.
2466212	2473519	And in news that I like to classify as no shit, the Zelda 3 game that was available on eBay, yeah, that was fake.
2475099	2478544	Not the real Zelda 3 game.
2479185	2481869	So yeah, that's kind of interesting.
2481889	2482911	And then finally...
2483854	2489458	I don't know why, but Pac-Man in Pac-Man World 3 is giving his own voice.
2490559	2491499	Who will be voicing him?
2491699	2505128	But Martin T. Sherman, who had voiced such games as Driver 3, Second Sight, and TimeSplitters Future Perfect, which, by the way, is a very underrated game.
2505709	2511172	But really awesome, and personally, I think Pac-Man World 3 is going to suck.
2511212	2511573	But anyways...
2512974	2514274	Why did you say it was really awesome?
2515355	2515815	I don't know.
2516135	2518057	You were still thinking about TimeSplitters.
2518297	2518857	I was still thinking.
2519277	2519858	Exactly.
2520918	2521198	Alright.
2521819	2525661	I have a couple WTF stories for you guys.
2526322	2527502	Tamagotchi DS.
2528163	2530084	I think we reported on this a few months ago.
2530124	2533466	We talked about Tamagotchi Corner Store, which was coming out in Japan.
2534006	2534547	Guess what?
2535807	2537048	It's coming out in the US.
2537768	2539329	They are going to bring this game out in the US.
2539389	2540310	Guess when it's coming out?
2541171	2541731	This fall.
2542611	2545113	Like, soon, very soon.
2545293	2548135	So I guess secretly this whole time they're reporting it to the U.S.
2548195	2559342	So it is coming out here, and they're saying that the original Tamagotchi struck a chord with kids who wanted a toy that complemented their active lifestyle, and these virtual pets were the perfect answer.
2559883	2566427	Tamagotchi provides the nurturing play pattern with the electronic component and portability that allows kids to take the toy with them wherever they go.
2566927	2570730	This coming from Rain Rice of the Toy Industry Association.
2572628	2580712	Now, what I do think is kind of cool about this is that it is actually being designed by Nana Onsha, who made Parappa the Rapper.
2581153	2594240	So, I'm not completely laughing at this game just yet, because it's Tamagotchi related, because, you know, Parappa changed, you know, Parappa provided, you could say we would not have music games today if it weren't for Parappa.
2595083	2595183	Halo 2
2621832	2624413	They're going to be getting better graphics when they're hitting the 360.
2624453	2628015	They're going to be getting graphic enhancements and whatnot.
2628695	2630756	So that's kind of something to look forward to.
2630776	2643522	They're actually redoing the graphics or enhancing them like they should have been with the PlayStation 2, which was a little bit better graphics on the PlayStation 2 when you're playing PlayStation 1 games.
2645754	2647475	So, that is how they're going to do it?
2647495	2649777	They're going to release so many games a week for backwards compatibility?
2649797	2654361	Yeah, basically, here's... I still have yet to really hear a clear, definitive answer.
2655001	2666850	It's going to be... Well, what I heard was it's about 20... The numbers they were throwing out, about 15 to 25 of the top titles right now are going to be starting the first week.
2666930	2669893	Each week, there's going to be more titles added to the list of compatibility.
2671174	2673676	You have to have a system with a hard drive and...
2674358	2677041	and you have to have an Xbox Live account, I think.
2677521	2678042	Interesting.
2678362	2685469	I'm not sure if it's a live gold account, because that would be really cheap of them, but I wouldn't put it past them.
2687871	2689072	My last story I have tonight.
2690594	2699102	Gamasutra ran a story earlier this week that talks about several executives of the company that is producing and distributing the Gizmondo
2700259	2704321	Supposedly they are connected to organized crime, the mob.
2704701	2705341	Swedish mob.
2705361	2707402	So the mob made your Gizmondo.
2707422	2711804	Yes, they're connected to the Swedish mob, supposedly, and all this stuff.
2712985	2719948	Of course, you know, they use the word alleged and all that stuff, but wouldn't that be interesting that the Gizmondo was actually funded by the mob?
2719988	2724570	Doesn't save it from being kind of crappy, which is what all the reviews are saying, is that the game is crappy, crappy, crappy.
2725070	2727292	Not the game, the system, and all its games are crappy crappy.
2727892	2736638	I have yet to put my hands on it, so I won't withhold final judgment, but rumor is this is going to go down in history somewhere next to the end gauge.
2737158	2737438	Sad.
2738139	2738619	Finally.
2739660	2740880	You already had your final shot.
2741341	2741701	Alright, fine.
2741761	2741981	One more.
2742001	2742381	What do you want?
2742782	2750887	This is kind of old news, because when people are downloading this, this won't apply to them anymore, but this weekend was the Nintendogs kind of
2751505	2752386	I'm glad my dogs are dead.
2778580	2785024	and Nintendo and GameStop are donating $50,000 to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.
2785284	2792908	Well, if all I get out of it is a crappy message from Haley Duff, then I'm glad I let my dog starve for the past three weeks because I haven't played that game at all.
2793869	2796650	I haven't fed my dog at all, so I'm done with that game.
2797891	2798932	Good thing it's not real.
2799572	2800813	Anyway, final thoughts.
2800993	2802033	We're about done with the show.
2802093	2802914	Final thoughts, Loki.
2804184	2807867	I need to play Shadow Colossus this week for sure.
2808027	2808367	Me too.
2808488	2812832	Otherwise, I'm going to be playing more, more, more Warriors.
2814073	2817056	My final thought is I need to not feed my dogs.
2817116	2819258	I need to feed myself right now because I'm very hungry.
