WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.520
We dance united together, we are one

00:03.520 --> 00:06.640
I'll take you there, baby, come go with me

00:06.640 --> 00:09.440
Ah, barriba y barra

00:09.440 --> 00:11.760
Y que choriba de toda

00:11.760 --> 00:14.880
La toda la toda la toda la corazón

00:14.880 --> 00:16.880
Barriba y barra

00:16.880 --> 00:20.480
Y que choriba de toda la toda la corazón

00:20.480 --> 00:22.480
Love you for my love and

00:37.480 --> 00:41.480
I fell in love with your voice and your laughter

00:41.480 --> 00:44.480
And just one smile always makes me believe

00:44.480 --> 00:48.480
My destiny curious if you are mine

00:48.480 --> 00:51.800
Oh, won't you tell me if we're meant to be?

01:18.480 --> 01:41.480
When you dance with me, boy, I know you feel my needs more

01:41.480 --> 01:48.480
When you dance with me, boy, I know you feel my needs, boy

01:48.480 --> 02:06.480
Mambo mambo teo, Mambo mambo teo

02:06.480 --> 02:08.480
One, two, three!

02:36.480 --> 03:06.160
what's the point, it's like trying to shove a piano through a door when there's a perfectly

03:06.160 --> 03:17.740
good window right there. I mean, I don't see the point. And that's why men will never have

03:17.740 --> 03:29.320
babies. The genius of Loki on Orange Lounge Radio. The following live program is a special

03:29.320 --> 03:36.320
presentation of Orange Lounge Radio.

03:43.040 --> 03:50.040
Hello everybody, it is October 9th, 2005. You're tuned in to Orange Lounge Radio Live.

03:50.160 --> 03:54.440
And we're about ready to kick off tonight's program. On tonight's program, we're going

03:54.440 --> 03:58.280
to be talking a little bit about Extreme 2's online mode, because I got a chance to play

03:58.280 --> 04:02.800
that this week. And we're also going to be talking a little bit about Tycho Drummaster

04:02.800 --> 04:06.960
because X-Defer picked that up this week and he's like obsessed with Tycho Drummaster all

04:06.960 --> 04:10.800
of a sudden. So we definitely have to talk to him about that and his movie reveal. All

04:10.800 --> 04:14.560
that and all the other crap you're used to here on this lovely program known as Orange

04:14.560 --> 04:21.560
Orange Lounge Radio, see you after this.

04:44.560 --> 05:13.560
You're mentioning the Orange Man Iridium Live, the body-talked radio, so much more.

05:13.560 --> 05:15.560
Oh

05:16.820 --> 05:18.820
God

05:19.140 --> 05:21.140
Call me daddy

05:22.020 --> 05:25.700
Orange lounge may contain adult content

05:26.100 --> 05:29.840
Orange lounge may contain many four-letter words

05:30.600 --> 05:33.660
Orange lounge may contain a scene of nudity

05:34.460 --> 05:37.160
Orange lounge may contain plenty of

05:37.160 --> 05:40.160
Muh-uh-muh-chuh-muh-kocky.

05:40.160 --> 05:44.160
Just kidding, Orange Lounge Radio will not contain any of that.

05:44.160 --> 05:45.160
In this episode...

05:45.160 --> 05:47.160
Why isn't that special?

05:51.160 --> 06:02.160

06:39.600 --> 06:40.880
the place to be.

06:40.880 --> 06:44.800
My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Skye, joining me as always are my awesome

06:44.800 --> 06:46.080
co-hosts.

06:46.080 --> 06:48.960
Not here right now is Dark Sakura!

06:48.960 --> 06:55.880
Yeah, I'm actually not sure where she's at, I know she said something about homework was

06:55.880 --> 06:59.040
probably going to delay her a little bit, but we'll see what's going on.

06:59.040 --> 07:03.080
I'm sure she's gonna run through the door any minute now going traffic or the line at Safeway or something

07:03.080 --> 07:09.040
So she'll be here any minute, but I we're here with us. And by the way, when dark Sakura does get here everybody

07:10.840 --> 07:13.440
Just kidding I could never fire her she kicked my ass

07:14.220 --> 07:18.320
Right here is the one and only Loki. Hello. How you doing, Loki?

07:19.120 --> 07:24.080
Good, except I'm good in the you know, the department of developing pictures

07:24.080 --> 07:27.200
I I will talk about this later because I want to talk about how stupid that thing is

07:27.200 --> 07:28.200
So we'll talk about that in a little bit.

07:28.200 --> 07:31.200
I noticed Loki is sporting his In the Courtroom shirt today.

07:31.200 --> 07:36.200
So, those of you guys that won prizes a couple weeks ago, we finally got the In the Courtroom shirts.

07:36.200 --> 07:40.200
So our grand prize winner, who won that? Justin and Icy, I think, won the haiku thing.

07:40.200 --> 07:44.200
We're going to be sending the In the Courtroom shirt along with the In the Coop game this week.

07:44.200 --> 07:48.200
And I'll tell you what, I can't say anything about something that's in the works right now,

07:48.200 --> 07:52.200
but I'll be damned if this isn't the best week for us to be doing this.

07:52.200 --> 07:58.200
It helps save it for next week because it's going to be great, that's all I can say.

07:58.200 --> 07:59.200
Are you sure about irony?

07:59.200 --> 08:00.200
Yeah, I know.

08:00.200 --> 08:05.200
Anyway, we're here though and we're going to be talking about all sorts of other stuff.

08:05.200 --> 08:08.200
Bugd is also here tonight, one of our guests.

08:08.200 --> 08:09.200
Howdy.

08:09.200 --> 08:10.200
How you doing?

08:10.200 --> 08:12.200
Hi, I have a PSP.

08:12.200 --> 08:13.200
And fuck traffic apparently.

08:13.200 --> 08:14.200
I knew it.

08:14.200 --> 08:15.200
What did I say?

08:15.200 --> 08:19.200
I said she'd walk in here and she'd go fuck traffic or fuck the line at Safeway.

08:19.200 --> 08:21.200
One of the two.

08:21.200 --> 08:23.200
Hi DarkSakura, how are you?

08:23.200 --> 08:25.200
Got your butt.

08:25.200 --> 08:27.200
Next.

08:27.200 --> 08:29.200
Alright.

08:29.200 --> 08:33.200
So we're here, and we're about ready to get started with tonight's show.

08:33.200 --> 08:37.200
Xtafur is out in the front room playing Tycho Drummaster.

08:37.200 --> 08:38.200
My fault!

08:38.200 --> 08:41.200
Yeah, your fault. I'll be talking to you about that later.

08:41.200 --> 08:42.200
We'll get into that.

08:42.200 --> 08:44.200
Meanwhile though, let's get tonight's show started.

08:44.200 --> 08:46.200
Get your butt in the chatroom, Warrensonitrader.com.

08:46.200 --> 08:48.200
We're going to come back, we're going to talk a little bit about

08:48.200 --> 08:53.000
Something's going on in the Bomani scene, although it's kind of a slow news week because everybody's playing

08:53.680 --> 08:59.200
Dance Dance Revolution Extreme 2. I want to talk about online mode a little bit though because I finally got into online mode today

08:59.200 --> 09:04.000
It's very interesting and I can talk about my gaming router adventures and everything so it'll be fun. We're gonna have a fun show kids

09:04.000 --> 09:06.640
We'll be back after this. We're gonna start it off this break with a song

09:06.880 --> 09:10.760
That definitely had a lot of people talking last week. We're gonna talk about it a little bit more this week

09:10.760 --> 09:14.920
But we're going to play the original uncensored version of Injection of Love.

09:14.920 --> 09:21.920
We'll be back after this.

10:44.920 --> 10:49.920
Oh, clover, won't you play with the emo?

10:49.920 --> 10:50.940
Oh...

12:19.920 --> 12:22.920
It's a miracle, it's a miracle

12:22.920 --> 12:28.920
It's easy, but I'm made out of fortune and old

12:42.920 --> 12:45.920
It's got to be your love

12:45.920 --> 12:53.920
The only love I want and all You are the angel of my life

12:55.920 --> 13:02.920
It's tough to see my heart Bein' beside you on my own at all

13:02.920 --> 13:11.920
I wanna get closer to you, my love Until the day I die

13:11.920 --> 13:14.420

13:14.420 --> 13:18.420

13:22.420 --> 13:23.920

13:23.920 --> 13:27.420

13:30.420 --> 13:31.920

13:31.920 --> 13:33.920

13:33.920 --> 13:35.920

13:38.920 --> 13:40.920
Forever we're in the dark

13:40.920 --> 13:43.920

16:45.800 --> 16:50.200
has been done at two of Dark Sakura's places.

16:50.200 --> 16:53.800
Yeah, because I moved once and then I moved again.

16:53.800 --> 16:55.720
This show gets around quite a bit.

16:55.720 --> 16:57.040
We're such a ho.

Yeah, that's right.

16:58.040 --> 16:59.040
We're whores for you kids.

16:59.040 --> 17:01.760
How are you doing tonight, this lovely Sunday evening?

17:01.760 --> 17:04.560
I hear this constant pounding in my head tonight.

17:04.560 --> 17:05.560
Just a constant pounding.

17:05.560 --> 17:11.640
It's just extra for playing taiko drum master out in the living room.

17:11.640 --> 17:12.640
Oops!

17:12.640 --> 17:13.640
Dark Sakura, what the hell?

17:13.640 --> 17:14.640
What did you do?

17:14.640 --> 17:23.020
Friday night we had our supposed to be weekly Firefly marathon and we went out to do late

17:23.020 --> 17:30.380
night lions and came back and I was actually hunting down the turbo duo to play some Dracula

17:30.380 --> 17:40.100
X and instead Dan's like, put up your free taiko drum master, so I did and I have a RO

17:40.100 --> 17:45.900
I'm not going to say the name, but I also have, of course, the original, because Dan

17:45.900 --> 17:47.660
got all that for free for me.

17:47.660 --> 17:51.840
And so we played, like, a bunch, unlike, like, two songs.

17:51.840 --> 17:54.900
My hands were bruised by the time I was done.

17:54.900 --> 17:57.420
And I won the watermelon contest.

17:57.420 --> 17:58.420
The watermelon contest?

17:58.420 --> 17:59.420
The minigames.

17:59.420 --> 18:00.420
Oh, and the minigames.

18:00.420 --> 18:01.420
I haven't really played enough Ticodermism.

18:01.420 --> 18:04.220
I've played Ticodotatogen, but I don't remember that minigame.

18:04.220 --> 18:07.300
I'm going to be importing some of the Ticodotatogen.

18:07.300 --> 18:11.480
I've played like three different Taiko no Tatujin games thanks to Navi the Papa Music

18:11.480 --> 18:12.480
Horror.

18:12.480 --> 18:14.520
He has like all of them, so I've played a bunch of those.

18:14.520 --> 18:16.320
I don't remember the watermelon eating game.

18:16.320 --> 18:19.360
I remember when it was like- The intro was cracked out.

18:19.360 --> 18:23.840
That is one of the queerest movies I've ever seen, the How to Play.

18:23.840 --> 18:25.520
The How to Play was great.

18:25.520 --> 18:32.280
The How to Play was like, when the red dot comes, hit the note, boom boom ba doom, boom

18:32.280 --> 18:33.280
boom ba doom.

18:33.280 --> 18:36.160
It's like those little songs that- I'm talking about the intro though.

18:36.160 --> 18:42.840
It was cold cracked out, and it made me really have a craving for takoyaki.

18:42.840 --> 18:43.840
Takoyaki is yummy.

18:43.840 --> 18:50.480
Did it bring out your inner egg, where you're white on the outside, yellow on the inside?

18:50.480 --> 18:53.640
I just want takoyaki, because takoyaki is yummy.

18:53.640 --> 18:56.800
Don't they have takoyaki, Belle?

18:56.800 --> 18:57.800
Die!

18:57.800 --> 19:03.000
And by the way, school sucks.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.720
And by the way, school sucks.

19:05.720 --> 19:07.280
Oh, I was just about to ask you?

19:07.280 --> 19:08.280
Sucks my big fat toe.

19:08.280 --> 19:10.780
I was about to get into, uh, you know...

19:10.780 --> 19:11.780
Itchy.

19:11.780 --> 19:12.780
Itchy toe.

19:12.780 --> 19:13.780
Everybody...

19:13.780 --> 19:14.780
My rash-covered toe.

19:14.780 --> 19:15.780
Is your rash gone?

19:15.780 --> 19:16.780
No, it's not gone.

19:16.780 --> 19:17.780
I want to see it.

19:17.780 --> 19:18.780
Where's...

19:18.780 --> 19:19.780
I still have big psoriasis.

19:19.780 --> 19:20.780
What happened with the rash?

19:20.780 --> 19:21.780
Look at my toe.

19:21.780 --> 19:22.780
You'll see scary.

19:22.780 --> 19:23.780
And this is a great radio.

19:23.780 --> 19:24.780
This is going to look like a...

19:24.780 --> 19:27.780
I know, this is a wonderful radio.

19:27.780 --> 19:29.340
Okay, now that I see.

19:29.340 --> 19:30.340
How did you get a rash?

19:30.340 --> 19:34.980
Well, it began with that sinus infection that I was so pissed off at my doctor for not giving

19:34.980 --> 19:35.980
me antibiotics for.

19:35.980 --> 19:39.500
I want to point out, first of all, Dark Sakura thought she got it from this apartment at

19:39.500 --> 19:40.500
first.

19:40.500 --> 19:43.780
Yeah, because I didn't start itching until I was here doing the show.

19:43.780 --> 19:44.780
You're allergic to extrofer.

19:44.780 --> 19:45.780
That's basically what it is.

19:45.780 --> 19:46.780
I am allergic to gay...

19:46.780 --> 19:47.780
Okay.

19:47.780 --> 19:48.780
You're allergic to gay people?

19:48.780 --> 19:49.780
Is that what you're going to say?

19:49.780 --> 19:50.780
Gay people?

19:50.780 --> 19:51.780
No.

19:51.780 --> 19:52.780
Are you homophobic, ma'am?

19:52.780 --> 19:53.780
I'm allergic to your carpet.

19:53.780 --> 19:54.780
Your gay carpet.

19:54.780 --> 19:56.780
to your carpet.

19:56.780 --> 19:58.780
Your gay carpet?

19:58.780 --> 20:00.780
You and I have something in common, honey.

20:00.780 --> 20:02.780
I don't like like either!

20:02.780 --> 20:04.780
I don't like carpet either!

20:04.780 --> 20:06.780
Yay! Anyway.

20:06.780 --> 20:08.780
No, um...

20:08.780 --> 20:11.780
No, I can't be allergic to gay because I caught that already.

20:11.780 --> 20:12.780
Yeah, yeah.

20:12.780 --> 20:14.780
At, uh, Spigle. Five years ago.

20:14.780 --> 20:16.780
How did you catch gay at Spigle?

20:16.780 --> 20:19.780
Because, okay, this is an old story.

20:19.780 --> 20:21.780
Do tell.

20:21.780 --> 20:29.780
I remember my big Pepsi bong, I got this big, bone-shaped Pepsi drink with a long straw.

20:29.780 --> 20:32.780
I don't know if they still sell it at Spigle. I highly doubt it.

20:32.780 --> 20:34.780
Spigle, by the way, Sunnyvale, California.

20:34.780 --> 20:38.780
And you had just got done playing an intense game of DDR.

20:38.780 --> 20:42.780
So you said, here, do you want something to drink? I don't have any diseases.

20:42.780 --> 20:46.780
And you say, okay, and take a Spigle drink, and I take it back, and I take my drink, and you go, I have gay.

20:46.780 --> 20:49.780
I was like, oh my god, suddenly I want Irene.

20:52.780 --> 20:53.280
I remember that.

20:53.280 --> 20:54.280
OK, I remember that now.

20:54.280 --> 20:55.780
Yeah, that was an old story.

20:55.780 --> 20:57.280
OK.

20:57.280 --> 21:00.280
But it turned out, well, my doctor,

21:00.280 --> 21:02.780
after two weeks of all these other treatments

21:02.780 --> 21:05.780
and I don't get better, we decided it's not viral.

21:05.780 --> 21:07.780
So it puts me on amoxicillin, which

21:07.780 --> 21:09.280
I've never reacted to before.

21:09.280 --> 21:11.780
I called my mom to make sure before I started taking it, mom,

21:11.780 --> 21:13.280
do you have any reactions to amoxicillin?

21:13.280 --> 21:14.780
No, it's just penicillin.

21:14.780 --> 21:18.780
And these are the same family, but some people don't have reactions to one that they do to the other.

21:18.780 --> 21:22.280
It's like, okay, so I take it, I'm fine, I finish it up last week.

21:22.280 --> 21:25.780
And then Sunday, during the middle of the show, I start to itch.

21:25.780 --> 21:27.780
Itch, itch, itch. I don't think anything of it.

21:27.780 --> 21:31.280
And Monday I'm a little itchy, you know, just a little bit itchier, and then I go to spin,

21:31.280 --> 21:35.280
which of course the worst thing you can do when you are having a rash is to exercise,

21:35.280 --> 21:36.780
because you are not supposed to be warm.

21:36.780 --> 21:40.280
Spin, by the way, is a class at the gym where you ride a bike a lot.

21:40.280 --> 21:41.280
Yeah.

21:41.280 --> 21:41.780
Okay.

21:41.780 --> 21:43.780
And different in exciting positions.

21:43.780 --> 21:46.760
because the light does not spin around country before that i thought it was

21:46.760 --> 21:50.560
just you know what will kids do where they'd never get up and spin kind of

21:50.560 --> 21:53.520
but that was the best thing on the playground i think that

21:53.520 --> 21:56.320
you could be it's been a little merry-go-round like put your friends on

21:56.320 --> 21:57.280
it and then you'd like

21:57.280 --> 22:01.080
get five people just to spin that thing it's all right and then tell them i

22:01.080 --> 22:03.880
said in the order of uh... like everybody gets so dizzy they throw up

22:03.880 --> 22:08.720
it's you know that still fun we need to do or something like the park

22:08.720 --> 22:12.280
we do one of our we need to do one of our podcast at the park

22:12.280 --> 22:15.180
on the merry-go-round. As I was saying...

22:15.180 --> 22:19.260
Tuesday I have red welts all over my body.

22:19.260 --> 22:22.680
I am itching and miserable. Wednesday

22:22.680 --> 22:26.700
I call the doctor in the morning and go ahead and schedule my appointment and

22:26.700 --> 22:30.760
as the day develops my throat starts closing up. I'm having trouble breathing.

22:30.760 --> 22:35.220
I had stomach cramps so bad... You definitely didn't catch Gaye because your throat wouldn't be

22:35.220 --> 22:35.960
closing up.

22:35.960 --> 22:40.320
Okay, as I was saying

22:40.320 --> 22:48.080
I went to eat at the deli that I normally do behind my work, and as I was walking back,

22:48.080 --> 22:52.360
my stomach cramps were so bad that I would have to stop because I could not walk, because

22:52.360 --> 22:57.960
it hurt to put the pressure on my stomach from the motion of walking.

22:57.960 --> 23:03.960
So I went to the doctor, it took a while to narrow down everything because the drugs were

23:03.960 --> 23:07.440
the last thing I was thinking of since I never react to drugs, and it turned out it was the

23:07.440 --> 23:13.520
amoxicillin had done nothing different and so I'm given beautiful antihistamines

23:13.520 --> 23:17.080
which actually don't make me as sleepy as she said they would not like Benadryl

23:17.080 --> 23:23.800
which is instant coma and a pill. And this is drug chat with dark Sakura. But

23:23.800 --> 23:30.800
and then one of my co-workers who has issues with eczema let me use her

23:30.800 --> 23:36.280
prescription for this ointment that made the itch go away. You know I once had an

23:36.280 --> 23:39.400
allergic reaction to amoxicillin. It was the first time I was ever on penicillin of any

23:39.400 --> 23:42.700
type. I was probably like 12 years old and I don't even remember why I was on amoxicillin.

23:42.700 --> 23:46.000
Why do they put people on amoxicillin? Because they have like sinus infections or something?

23:46.000 --> 23:49.100
It's an antibiotic. It's an antibiotic. I love that stuff. It tastes so good. That is

23:49.100 --> 23:52.960
gross. It doesn't taste like anything. It's a pill. That's right, because my doctor. Well,

23:52.960 --> 23:56.400
I don't take pills. I can't swallow pills. I just had a sinus infection when I got back

23:56.400 --> 24:00.320
from Pennsylvania like a couple of months ago and the doctor wanted to put me on amoxicillin

24:00.320 --> 24:04.760
and I was like, no. Because I get really bad rashes. Like, I had a rash so bad, like it

24:04.760 --> 24:09.760
look, my chest was all pink and spotty. It looked like, I don't even know how it said.

24:09.760 --> 24:13.880
You didn't know how bad it was at the club. I went in and sat on these couches, and it's

24:13.880 --> 24:20.880
under a blacklight. And I'm so very pale that all the places where I was broken out

24:20.880 --> 24:24.320
looked like big black spots. Oh my God.

24:24.320 --> 24:26.920
Because my skin normally glows when I go in the club.

24:26.920 --> 24:32.240
To which they went, oh no, she's infected. Someone mentioned that my neck looked like

24:32.240 --> 24:33.740
like it had a continent on it.

24:33.740 --> 24:35.740
Did it say you had the SARS?

24:35.740 --> 24:37.740
Yeah, it was SARS.

24:37.740 --> 24:40.740
So besides diseaseful, how was your week?

24:40.740 --> 24:43.740
I played lots of games.

24:43.740 --> 24:44.740
Like what?

24:44.740 --> 24:47.740
I played, I finally opened up my copy of Katamari.

24:47.740 --> 24:49.740
Yay, so we can say the K word again.

24:49.740 --> 24:50.740
We can say the K word again.

24:50.740 --> 24:51.740
Alright, good to hear.

24:51.740 --> 24:55.740
And then I played some World of Warcraft.

24:55.740 --> 25:00.740
And thought about asking Dan to buy me DDR and then I thought no.

25:00.740 --> 25:03.860
You know, I realized why I can't ever play World of Warcraft.

25:03.860 --> 25:08.660
Why? Because everybody I... like a lot of people I know play World of Warcraft, and

25:08.660 --> 25:11.580
everybody's trying to get me to sign up and go to their server.

25:11.580 --> 25:15.100
The problem is that everybody is on a different server.

25:15.100 --> 25:19.100
So if I sign up for that game, I'm going to have to pick a server to go to, and

25:19.100 --> 25:21.780
I'm going to piss people off. No, not necessarily.

25:21.780 --> 25:25.580
The... and, and, um, except for having this conversation the other day, when I was

25:25.580 --> 25:29.180
showing World of Warcraft, you can have as many characters as you want on as

25:29.180 --> 25:32.420
as many servers as you want to and not get charged for it.

25:32.420 --> 25:36.900
But I don't like the whole spreading of characters because then you don't have time to focus

25:36.900 --> 25:38.860
and get one really, really uber powerful...

25:38.860 --> 25:42.300
But you level so fast. Seriously.

25:42.300 --> 25:44.380
Not Guild Wars fast, but fast.

25:44.380 --> 25:47.420
I was in an hour of gameplay, I made level 6.

25:47.420 --> 25:51.860
You can't do that on Final Fantasy XI, I'm sorry.

25:51.860 --> 25:52.820
Not when you first play.

25:52.820 --> 25:54.380
Not in an hour of gameplay.

25:54.380 --> 25:56.140
Not when you first play.

25:56.140 --> 26:00.620
you have people freaking tanking for you or something, but by yourself. There's ways,

26:00.620 --> 26:05.260
but not when you first play. You can run around and not kill anything and at least go up two

26:05.260 --> 26:10.900
levels. On World of Warcraft? On World of Warcraft. You find a lake, you get 50 experience

26:10.900 --> 26:15.580
points. You find a town, you get 100 experience points. You meet X person, you get 100 experience

26:15.580 --> 26:19.740
points. That's retarded. You finish a quest, you get 50, actually it is not for the simple

26:19.740 --> 26:26.300
reason it is an RPG if you do tabletop RPG if you do live-action RPG you get

26:26.300 --> 26:30.660
experience for doing things and participating in the game not for just

26:30.660 --> 26:33.900
going around doing freaking hack and slash which I think is ridiculous you

26:33.900 --> 26:41.260
discover you have arms to experience you discovered the secret to lovemaking you

26:41.260 --> 26:47.180
just hit puberty thank you grow your first pubes five experience but I like

26:47.180 --> 26:54.340
that in the fact that experience is defined by what you do not just what you

26:54.340 --> 27:00.900
kill. Also Jamie. Oh hi. Hello. Take a break from Tycho long enough to say hello. I did.

27:00.900 --> 27:07.660
All right. Yo everyone. Are your hands bruised yet? No my hands aren't bruised yet. What I was

27:07.660 --> 27:11.700
gonna ask you to tell you to say is what happens when you die on World

27:11.700 --> 27:15.680
of Warcraft. Oh yeah you have to go back and find your body. You're a ghost. I do

27:15.680 --> 27:16.680
I do remember seeing that.

27:16.680 --> 27:17.680
Yeah.

27:17.680 --> 27:18.680
Yeah.

27:18.680 --> 27:22.000
That's pretty cool because I haven't died yet because I'm awesome.

27:22.000 --> 27:26.440
Now of course, usually when we do little things like that where we just start repeating one

27:26.440 --> 27:29.120
thing over and over, gaining experience, our chat room joins in.

27:29.120 --> 27:31.160
I'd like to share some of the little things they've come up with here.

27:31.160 --> 27:34.520
We have L. Mullet who, God, I haven't seen him in chat in forever.

27:34.520 --> 27:35.520
Welcome back.

27:35.520 --> 27:42.940
L. Mullet says that you lost your virginity, 50 experience points and chlamydia.

27:42.940 --> 27:43.940
Got pizza times four.

27:43.940 --> 27:51.460
I think that's a reference to the slash pizza command in EverQuest you randomly die six experience you learn what IRC is

27:52.340 --> 27:54.340
You guys are weird. All right

27:55.900 --> 27:58.140
You know in in real life

27:58.140 --> 28:04.180
You know the different things you do add to your experience and teach you along the way and you love a little sometimes

28:04.180 --> 28:06.700
You do level when you find things out in real life. I

28:08.420 --> 28:10.420
Traumatize me minus

28:10.420 --> 28:13.420
Your boyfriend's been fucking around on your back and behind your back.

28:13.420 --> 28:19.420
I do like the fact how they have a quest where you can get a chicken pet to follow you around, and the chicken pet's easily killed.

28:19.420 --> 28:23.420
So it's a very complex quest for a really useless item.

28:23.420 --> 28:29.420
The last quest series of quests that I've been doing, and I'm on the last leg of the series, are the

28:29.420 --> 28:32.420
Go to this fountain and fill this bottle and bring it back.

28:32.420 --> 28:39.420
And I've done this with five different locations, and now I'm going to the big town to give my bottle to somebody.

28:39.420 --> 28:43.360
And I'm, like, kinda underleveled for where I am, because I've just been running quests.

28:43.360 --> 28:48.360
I think it would be cooler in World of Warcraft if the chicken that followed you, you could start slashing it, like, over and over,

28:48.360 --> 28:53.880
and then all of a sudden, all the chickens start attacking you, and then it says,

28:53.880 --> 29:00.560
and then it says, you got a cock in your ear, fifty experience points, and you got your brains fucked out.

29:00.560 --> 29:05.420
Thank you, Xtavor. I like playing the zombies, though, because you can eat people.

29:05.420 --> 29:09.420
If you play the undead, you can regain energy by feeding on corpses.

29:09.420 --> 29:10.420
That's lovely.

29:10.420 --> 29:12.980
So what happens if somebody eats your corpse before you find it?

29:12.980 --> 29:14.460
I think it's eating other corpses.

29:14.460 --> 29:17.980
I haven't tried doing it yet, because the other good thing about it is that you regenerate

29:17.980 --> 29:24.420
XP and you regenerate your MP or energy if you're one of the undead.

29:24.420 --> 29:27.500
You got sued by Konami.

29:27.500 --> 29:28.500
That's great.

29:28.500 --> 29:31.540
You got sued by Konami minus 999 experience.

29:31.540 --> 29:38.340
wouldn't it be minus five seven three experience I don't know as I was saying

29:38.340 --> 29:45.220
without saying anything all I have to say is that this week something the most

29:45.220 --> 29:50.780
hilarious thing is about to happen I can't even put it into words next week

29:50.780 --> 29:53.540
you guys is it gonna be done by next Sunday or do we have to wait till we

29:53.540 --> 29:58.340
Thursday so is it gonna be done by next Sunday yeah stay tuned on our website

29:58.340 --> 30:02.580
We got big news coming up, and next Sunday we're going to have a field day.

30:02.580 --> 30:03.580
That's all I have to say.

30:03.580 --> 30:06.380
I just find that the other thing that was occurring to me that I also find hilarious

30:06.380 --> 30:10.100
about that is just the number of things I'm going to have on display.

30:10.100 --> 30:11.100
I know, I know.

30:11.100 --> 30:12.100
When said person.

30:12.100 --> 30:13.100
I know.

30:13.100 --> 30:14.100
Anyway, anyway.

30:14.100 --> 30:15.100
No more about that.

30:15.100 --> 30:16.100
No more.

30:16.100 --> 30:17.100
There's your teaser.

30:17.100 --> 30:18.100
I dread.

30:18.100 --> 30:19.100
I dread what's going to come of this.

30:19.100 --> 30:20.100
I'll be bringing it out.

30:20.100 --> 30:21.100
I dread.

30:21.100 --> 30:22.100
Anyway, our listeners are still watching.

30:22.100 --> 30:23.100
I don't know.

30:23.100 --> 30:24.100
What the fuck are they talking about?

30:24.100 --> 30:30.820
But I'm going to be putting out my pop music controller in my...

30:30.820 --> 30:34.500
If the listeners are going to accuse us of jumping the shark ever, next week will be

30:34.500 --> 30:35.500
it.

30:35.500 --> 30:36.500
Oh yeah.

30:36.500 --> 30:37.500
I swear to God, next week will be it.

30:37.500 --> 30:38.500
I even find this hilarious.

30:38.500 --> 30:39.500
They asked for it.

30:39.500 --> 30:40.500
Anyway.

30:40.500 --> 30:42.900
You should put other, like, Bamani and stuff out.

30:42.900 --> 30:43.900
Anyway!

30:43.900 --> 30:44.900
Moving on.

30:44.900 --> 30:45.900
It'll be around.

30:45.900 --> 30:46.900
Loki, how was your week?

30:46.900 --> 30:47.900
How was your day?

30:47.900 --> 30:49.140
My week was okay.

30:49.140 --> 30:50.780
I didn't play that many games.

30:50.780 --> 30:57.400
I played Burnout, and more Burnout, and more Burnout. And... So, anyways, my week started

30:57.400 --> 31:03.500
off with I had to go to, um... Jury Duty. And, uh...

31:03.500 --> 31:05.740
Oh my God, you went to Jury Duty this week. That's right.

31:05.740 --> 31:06.740
Yes. How'd that go?

31:06.740 --> 31:11.860
I didn't get called. Instead, I had to watch four movies, um, because they played movies

31:11.860 --> 31:16.540
while we were waiting. So, I got to watch Advent Children again on my PSP, and then

31:16.540 --> 31:21.500
Then I watched Episode 4 of Star Wars.

31:21.500 --> 31:27.060
And then finally, the Pacifier, followed by While You Were Sleeping.

31:27.060 --> 31:28.060
Extremely boring.

31:28.060 --> 31:33.300
But I got to play Burnout that day on my PSP, so that was fun.

31:33.300 --> 31:38.780
And then, other than that, today I played Let's Return Games to GameStop and pre-order

31:38.780 --> 31:44.220
Xbox 360 games, so I did that, and I will have to say now I am an ordinary owner of

31:44.220 --> 31:48.220
I have one copy of Nintendogs and not three.

31:48.220 --> 31:51.220
You're supposed to let me take the doggies.

31:51.220 --> 31:53.220
Oh well.

31:53.220 --> 31:56.220
So then, wow, what a nice guy.

31:56.220 --> 32:00.220
So I pre-ordered Gun and Project Gotham Racing 3.

32:00.220 --> 32:01.220
That's going to be awesome.

32:01.220 --> 32:04.220
And what else did I do this week?

32:04.220 --> 32:05.220
Eh, not too much.

32:05.220 --> 32:09.220
I'm supposed to be getting stylish attire for the...

32:09.220 --> 32:18.220
Because I'm going to Lake Tahoe this week for our 25th anniversary party for our company, and I have to wear stylus attire.

32:18.220 --> 32:26.220
So I have pinstripe pants, and I have my shirt for it. I'm gonna look pimp. But anyways, what else?

32:26.220 --> 32:34.220
Oh, that's pretty much it. You know, just lots of work stuff, and yeah. Some stuff like that.

32:34.220 --> 32:35.220
Sounds good.

32:35.220 --> 32:43.220
Oh, and right now my stomach feels like it's being eaten by zombies because I just finished, um, a quarter pounder.

32:43.220 --> 32:47.220
You know what? Fuck the McDonald's Monopoly game. Fuck it all.

32:47.220 --> 32:51.220
It seems like every other month it's like, Monopoly's back!

32:51.220 --> 32:59.220
It's like this big excuse to come eat like crap and supersize your meals so you can get, and even though they claim they don't do supersizing anymore, they do.

32:59.220 --> 33:00.220
They don't.

33:00.220 --> 33:01.220
Yes, they do.

33:01.220 --> 33:03.220
They turn the supersize into large.

33:03.220 --> 33:04.220
No.

33:04.220 --> 33:09.540
large is not as big as supersize. Trust me, I am missing out on potential drink and fries.

33:09.540 --> 33:14.100
And you know, they finally switched the cups back to these nice plastic ones that don't

33:14.100 --> 33:19.460
fucking blow up when I put them in my cup holder, because that was really fun. But at

33:19.460 --> 33:25.700
least they have that fixed now. And what I have to say is now this new Monopoly game

33:25.700 --> 33:30.820
you play online as well as collect the stupid pieces. So I've been playing it online and

33:30.820 --> 33:37.380
And so far I've won three times the stupid, um, prints at this fish something or other.

33:37.380 --> 33:42.500
I don't know, some stupid online, uh, photo place. So now I can get, like, 75 exposures.

33:42.500 --> 33:45.940
That's great, except I don't take pictures of anything. So...

33:45.940 --> 33:50.220
You should take, like, pornographic pictures of something, or I don't know, like, really

33:50.220 --> 33:53.860
raunchy photos, like, take pictures of you and Ellie having sex or something, and see

33:53.860 --> 33:54.860
if they'll develop it.

33:54.860 --> 33:55.860
They won't develop that crap.

33:55.860 --> 33:57.220
You don't know that. Try it.

33:57.220 --> 33:58.220
You know that.

33:58.220 --> 34:02.220
It'll make a statement.

34:02.220 --> 34:07.220
Oh, however, anyways, I'm just trying to win something else.

34:07.220 --> 34:12.220
But I do like these Best Buy bucks. That's the only thing I really play it for, is these Best Buy bucks.

34:12.220 --> 34:15.220
So I got four dollars from two different fries.

34:15.220 --> 34:18.220
But why didn't you just the four dollars that you would have spent on food?

34:18.220 --> 34:24.220
I did spend on food. I wanted fries, but I also got fries and free money.

34:24.220 --> 34:26.220
Hey, I like free money.

34:26.220 --> 34:34.220
Whatever. My week and my day was pretty okay. Yesterday I went to Fry's, which is, you know,

34:34.220 --> 34:38.100
nerd heaven. Fry's is this giant electronic store here on the West Coast. I don't think

34:38.100 --> 34:42.900
they have it on the East or it's slowly going out there or something. It's also Outpost.com

34:42.900 --> 34:47.540
online. And so I went to Fry's and I finally bought myself a gaming router, a wireless

34:47.540 --> 34:51.980
gaming router. And what that'll allow me to do is that, since Bug was good enough to give

34:51.980 --> 34:57.220
me a wireless router for the computer, because we didn't have a wireless router for the longest

34:57.220 --> 35:01.020
time, but he gave me a wireless router for the computer so I could use the PSP 2.0 browser

35:01.020 --> 35:04.340
and I knew the DS thing would be coming out too. And I didn't know they were going to

35:04.340 --> 35:08.700
release that dongle thing, the USB that you could plug into the back of your computer

35:08.700 --> 35:12.820
so you wouldn't even need a wireless network anyway, but it doesn't matter at this point.

35:12.820 --> 35:17.980
But anyway, without having to run a cord to the living room, because the Xbox and Playstation

35:17.980 --> 35:23.280
out in the living room, we have the routers in here for the computers, so I don't have

35:23.280 --> 35:27.680
a cable long enough, so I had to get a wireless gaming router, basically. It's specifically

35:27.680 --> 35:32.500
something you use to plug your Xbox and PlayStation into. So I bought one of those, and it's nice

35:32.500 --> 35:34.780
to be back on Xbox Live and getting killed at Halo.

35:34.780 --> 35:41.140
The other thing there, you reminded me about mentioning computer stuff. I got my main computer

35:41.140 --> 35:46.540
back, so I can play games now, and that made me happy. Also, I'm working on doing the pop

35:46.540 --> 35:50.220
music controller and I went and actually bought the pop music buttons

35:50.220 --> 35:53.780
so I have the official arcade buttons so you know and I don't play pop music I

35:53.780 --> 35:57.180
hate pop music but for some reason I'm building a pop music controller

35:57.180 --> 36:00.660
oh it reminds me I need to play some pop music stuff next break

36:00.660 --> 36:04.800
I have pop music 13 stuff I never got to in a previous week I don't think but anyway

36:04.800 --> 36:05.780
thank you for reminding me

36:05.780 --> 36:10.620
uh... what else did I do this week? not a whole lot I guess I started playing

36:10.620 --> 36:13.940
extreme 2 online today because since I got the router last night I was

36:13.940 --> 36:14.620
playing

36:14.620 --> 36:22.860
Extreme 2 online a little bit today. It's interesting. It's better than I thought it

36:22.860 --> 36:28.660
would be based on what I had heard early on, the feedback. It was a little bit better done

36:28.660 --> 36:32.900
than I thought it would be. But it seems like, I don't know, it feels like halfway finished

36:32.900 --> 36:39.840
to me. But I think that more has to do with the fact that UltraMix has a more polished

36:39.840 --> 36:43.380
online thing where you can actually choose your opponent and choose your song, which

36:43.380 --> 36:47.340
is kind of interesting, but I wonder if that has to do with the fact that Xbox Live is

36:47.340 --> 36:52.300
just probably better set up for that kind of thing than the free Playstation things.

36:52.300 --> 36:56.540
I have no idea. I don't program these games, I don't know, but the online one, if you guys

36:56.540 --> 37:00.700
have played it, you know that you don't choose your opponent, you just search for an opponent,

37:00.700 --> 37:04.520
and you don't get to choose your song. You only get to choose light, standard, heavy,

37:04.520 --> 37:12.080
or any. So, it's interesting. And I've played some top ranked players in the time that I've

37:12.080 --> 37:16.520
been on there. And what's very interesting about doing that is that, well, A, they've

37:16.520 --> 37:21.360
all really, really beat me. But the other interesting thing is that it's randomly picking

37:21.360 --> 37:26.320
your song. I've played probably like 15 to 18 matches online total, which really isn't

37:26.320 --> 37:29.820
a lot. That's probably about less than an hour of game time. I play like 15 to 18 matches

37:29.820 --> 37:36.200
online. Paranoia Survivor Max Heavy has come up three or four times at least. And there's

37:36.200 --> 37:39.940
supposed to be like 70 freaking songs in this game. It's picking songs at random. I got

37:39.940 --> 37:44.980
paranoia survivor max three or four times out of like like one out of every

37:44.980 --> 37:49.300
three matches with paranoia survivor max that's crap that's such crap because

37:49.300 --> 37:53.740
paranoia survivor max has bullshit steps if I want to play a song with bullshit

37:53.740 --> 37:59.300
steps I'll go play in the groove okay so that's my experience with online

37:59.300 --> 38:02.700
otherwise it's okay I mean I did the ranking thing it's it's fun I guess and

38:02.700 --> 38:05.760
you know playing matches is okay except you can't really talk to the person

38:05.760 --> 38:08.440
you're playing so you can only imagine what their reaction is like because I

38:08.440 --> 38:11.440
know I was playing one kid and he was doing really well and then all of a

38:11.440 --> 38:15.480
sudden it like I think he got pissed off that he got a good or something because

38:15.480 --> 38:19.500
all of a sudden you just see boo boo boo boo boo and all these you know misses

38:19.500 --> 38:23.200
going up his side of the screen so it's kind of funny but you can't really hear

38:23.200 --> 38:28.840
them like you can on Xbox so oh darn I know then again kids say really stupid

38:28.840 --> 38:33.600
shit on Xbox not so much DDR the DDR rooms are rather decent compared to like

38:33.600 --> 38:38.960
like Halo 2 or Doom 3, playing those online, and you got all those kids, like,

38:38.960 --> 38:43.960
I'm gonna beat you up, I'm gonna cut you, I'm gonna shoot you, faggot, bla bla bla.

38:43.960 --> 38:44.960
That's what playing is.

38:44.960 --> 38:46.960
I do what I want!

38:46.960 --> 38:47.960
Exactly.

38:47.960 --> 38:51.680
My mom ain't home right now, I got a 40, bla bla bla.

38:51.680 --> 38:52.680
I hate kids on explosives.

38:52.680 --> 38:56.680
I just stabbed my sister, I'll do what I want!

38:56.680 --> 38:57.680
Alright.

38:57.680 --> 38:59.680
Anyway, so that's that.

38:59.680 --> 39:02.560
Bugged, how was your week, how was your day?

39:02.560 --> 39:07.160
I sold all my DS stuff yesterday and picked up a PSP.

39:07.160 --> 39:10.280
And just because, what attracted you to PSP?

39:10.280 --> 39:11.280
The sound worked.

39:11.280 --> 39:13.480
My DS's sound was dead.

39:13.480 --> 39:16.480
They didn't ask me when I sold it if it worked or not.

39:16.480 --> 39:21.920
That's because anything that doesn't fully function and get sent back for refurbishment.

39:21.920 --> 39:22.920
Ahh.

39:22.920 --> 39:23.920
Nope.

39:23.920 --> 39:25.440
He didn't say anything about it.

39:25.440 --> 39:28.640
Just because they test them later and if they don't work they send it back to be refurbished.

39:28.640 --> 39:29.640
Oh good.

39:29.640 --> 39:32.280
I still got my 55 bucks for that.

39:32.280 --> 39:35.800
As it turned out, all my stuff was worth the $150, and this is clear back to, like, Pokemon

39:35.800 --> 39:36.800
Silver.

39:36.800 --> 39:37.800
Wow.

39:37.800 --> 39:39.440
All of my Game Boy stuff.

39:39.440 --> 39:40.440
And Nintendogs.

39:40.440 --> 39:45.960
I didn't play it often enough, but PSP I can at least do stuff other than play games on.

39:45.960 --> 39:49.580
I think I'm kind of done with Nintendogs, which is kind of sad, because I really, really

39:49.580 --> 39:50.580
love that game.

39:50.580 --> 39:52.080
I mean, and I remember saying it was like-

39:52.080 --> 39:53.080
It's over far too quick.

39:53.080 --> 39:54.080
It's, yeah.

39:54.080 --> 39:58.320
I don't, it doesn't hold my interest long enough, and maybe, maybe I'm just trying to

39:58.320 --> 40:02.400
to get more of a game out of it, and it's really not supposed to be that. I don't know.

40:02.400 --> 40:06.920
I hated that I have to play it. It's just like, I'm like, aw, goddammit, I gotta feed

40:06.920 --> 40:10.680
the dog again. I mean, that's not too surprising, because that's how Tamagotchis are, and that's

40:10.680 --> 40:14.600
how, you know, other virtual pets. I can't find my DS. Oh, shit. I left it in my locked

40:14.600 --> 40:18.880
drawer at work, because I take it to work. Oh, maybe that's it. Maybe, but my puppies

40:18.880 --> 40:23.320
are gonna be pissing all over my tatami house. Well, they don't pee on the floor, like they

40:23.320 --> 40:28.600
doing like Sims 2 and stuff. Anyway, so anything else?

40:28.600 --> 40:32.760
I went down to the Bay Area and ran into random people that we know.

40:32.760 --> 40:34.960
Yeah. I went to Dave & Buster's for dinner and as

40:34.960 --> 40:39.460
I was leaving I was like, wow, that really looks like, holy crap, it is. And there's

40:39.460 --> 40:44.160
a large, they took out two of the driving games right next to the entrance. What was

40:44.160 --> 40:48.200
it, the Namco whatever the hell it was, and the Tokyo Cop.

40:48.200 --> 40:50.200
Maximum Tune? Yeah, Maximum Tune.

40:50.200 --> 40:52.200
I'm like Tokyo Cop. Both of those are gone.

40:52.200 --> 40:56.200
Yeah, they took out Maximum Tune. It's not in there anymore.

40:56.200 --> 41:00.200
But those two are gone, and there's now a giant six-player trivia game.

41:00.200 --> 41:02.200
Six-player trivia game?

41:02.200 --> 41:06.200
Six-player trivia game. You have three buttons, A, B, and C. You just press the button of the answer.

41:06.200 --> 41:08.200
That sounds kind of interesting.

41:08.200 --> 41:10.200
It's a ticket game.

41:10.200 --> 41:18.200
As I walk up, our other intrepid listener had a pile of tickets running around her feet several times, as per usual.

41:18.200 --> 41:20.200
That's great.

41:20.200 --> 41:27.200
She bought an Xbox. This is her previous girl, by the way. She's been on the show before, so some of our listeners might know her.

41:27.200 --> 41:28.200
I don't know what she wouldn't buy on here, so...

41:28.200 --> 41:29.200
Sharks Girl.

41:29.200 --> 41:36.200
Okay. But she now has $50,000 in one. She came up six short, so I gave her three tickets to put her over $50,000.

41:36.200 --> 41:37.200
What's she buying now?

41:37.200 --> 41:38.200
PS3.

41:41.200 --> 41:43.200
Wow. That's crazy.

41:43.200 --> 41:47.200
But that was really strange to just randomly...

41:48.200 --> 41:49.200
Run into people?

41:49.200 --> 41:50.200
They run into people?

41:50.200 --> 41:51.200
Randomly run into people.

41:51.200 --> 41:53.720
And I was thinking about actually text messaging her and saying,

41:53.720 --> 41:57.160
Hey, are you up for Dave & Buster's Night?

41:57.160 --> 41:58.160
She read your mind.

41:58.160 --> 41:59.160
Apparently so.

41:59.160 --> 42:00.160
Amazing.

42:00.160 --> 42:01.160
Yep.

42:01.160 --> 42:02.160
I want to go check out the trivia game.

42:02.160 --> 42:03.520
Although I am sad about Tokyo Cop.

42:03.520 --> 42:04.520
Don't be.

42:04.520 --> 42:05.520
I like Tokyo Cop.

42:05.520 --> 42:06.520
Sucked.

42:06.520 --> 42:07.520
Tokyo Cop was really awful.

42:07.520 --> 42:08.520
You bastards.

42:08.520 --> 42:13.360
If it's the same game I'm thinking of, it's like right there when you walk through

42:13.360 --> 42:14.360
the door, it's right there on the right.

42:14.360 --> 42:15.360
Yeah, it drove the little crazy heart.

42:15.360 --> 42:16.720
I like Tokyo Cop.

42:16.720 --> 42:17.720
Nobody else did.

42:17.720 --> 42:22.720
You know what they need to get anywhere because they're releasing it over here is the Mario Kart arcade game.

42:22.720 --> 42:25.720
Holy God do I want to play that so bad.

42:25.720 --> 42:27.720
But that's geared towards kids.

42:27.720 --> 42:28.720
No it's not.

42:28.720 --> 42:30.720
No, I don't care. I'll kick the kids out.

42:30.720 --> 42:34.720
All they have to do is put something you can hold your beer in.

42:34.720 --> 42:35.720
Exactly.

42:35.720 --> 42:38.720
I'll tell you what, that F-Zero arcade game kicked ass.

42:38.720 --> 42:41.720
The only problem with F-Zero arcade game is that there was like three tracks.

42:41.720 --> 42:42.720
Four.

42:42.720 --> 42:43.720
Yeah, like four tracks.

42:43.720 --> 42:49.880
An F-Zero arcade game could have been amazing if they put more tracks on it, and like more

42:49.880 --> 42:50.880
to do.

42:50.880 --> 42:53.640
It wasn't so damn expected, but the F-Zero arcade game was awesome.

42:53.640 --> 42:54.640
I liked it.

42:54.640 --> 43:00.500
Well, the nice thing about going to Dave & Buster's for dinner and stuff, they had the $13.99

43:00.500 --> 43:01.900
get a $10 card.

43:01.900 --> 43:06.920
Now it's $14.99 all day, Monday through Thursday.

43:06.920 --> 43:10.240
By the way, secret message from our chat room.

43:10.240 --> 43:11.240
Poland, Poland!

43:11.240 --> 43:12.240
Poland, yes.

43:12.240 --> 43:19.280
There you go. She's psychic! Shark's girl just hopped in chat and said Poland, Poland!

43:19.280 --> 43:22.640
She's probably listening. I think so.

43:22.640 --> 43:24.720
She claims to. Her boyfriend was in chat earlier, so I think

43:24.720 --> 43:27.320
they're both listening. It looks that way.

43:27.320 --> 43:29.800
Yes. Poland. Definitely Poland.

43:29.800 --> 43:32.960
Is that like a trivia question thing or something? Yeah, everyone else answered right, because

43:32.960 --> 43:36.920
it was pretty obvious. And, well, she didn't.

43:36.920 --> 43:40.920
Alright, anyway. I don't even remember the whole question.

43:40.920 --> 43:42.920
It was something about Poland.

43:42.920 --> 43:43.920
No, it wasn't about Poland.

43:43.920 --> 43:44.920
No, it wasn't about Poland.

43:44.920 --> 43:46.920
It was about somebody being from a certain country,

43:46.920 --> 43:48.920
and one of the choices was Poland,

43:48.920 --> 43:50.920
but the right answer was something completely odd.

43:50.920 --> 43:53.920
I want to try this game out sometime.

43:53.920 --> 43:55.920
I'm going to have to go back to Dave & Buster's.

43:55.920 --> 43:57.920
I wish they'd build one here.

43:57.920 --> 43:59.920
I love the idea of a Chuck E. Cheese for adults,

43:59.920 --> 44:01.920
where kids aren't allowed after a certain time.

44:01.920 --> 44:02.920
That's like heaven to me.

44:02.920 --> 44:04.920
I don't think they should be allowed at all.

44:04.920 --> 44:08.920
In heaven, I don't want children to be allowed after 11 o'clock.

44:08.920 --> 44:11.420
If you could if you could just beat them up and kick them out of the way

44:11.500 --> 44:16.000
Yeah, kind of like how in Katamari when you hold down the button and run you can bump the cousins out exactly

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
Yeah, that would be perfect for kids at night

44:18.880 --> 44:20.880
because drunken rages are just like

44:21.760 --> 44:23.760
X2 four hours your week. How was your day?

44:25.200 --> 44:31.740
It's pretty much your usual week for me. I like went to work, you know

44:33.400 --> 44:35.400
Played music at home

44:35.400 --> 44:42.280
home, showered, shaved, masturbated more than a few times.

44:42.280 --> 44:48.840
And also, you know, on Fridays, Fridays have officially been dubbed Firefly Fridays.

44:48.840 --> 44:54.320
And so Jamie and I, or DarkSakra and I have- I prefer my name.

44:54.320 --> 44:55.320
Okay.

44:55.320 --> 45:00.420
Jamie and I went ahead and we went ahead and watched up to the end of the second

45:00.420 --> 45:03.300
Disc of Firefly, which was great, good times.

45:03.300 --> 45:05.300
The J-Town episode.

45:05.300 --> 45:07.940
Yeah, it's pretty funny.

45:07.940 --> 45:08.940
Pretty funny stuff.

45:08.940 --> 45:09.940
Still recommend the movie.

45:09.940 --> 45:10.940
A hero called me.

45:10.940 --> 45:11.940
That was great.

45:11.940 --> 45:12.940
Okay, sorry.

45:12.940 --> 45:17.340
So, anyhow, we went and saw...

45:17.340 --> 45:23.860
We saw that at our place, and then we also went to Lions, where I got to explain why

45:23.860 --> 45:29.460
Pez candy is like the sheepskin condom of candy.

45:29.460 --> 45:34.460
Oh, you want to know why? Oh, okay.

45:34.460 --> 45:38.300
Probably not, but okay. Because sheepskin condoms are like the classic

45:38.300 --> 45:45.820
that nobody really thinks about now. And so are PEZ candies.

45:45.820 --> 45:49.460
PEZ candies go in those now? They just may.

45:49.460 --> 45:55.900
You know a sheepskin condom PEZ candy dispenser? That might be something to talk about.

45:55.900 --> 45:59.380
Just move on, please. So that would make the PEZ condiments, right?

45:59.380 --> 46:06.980
So anyways, that was my week.

46:06.980 --> 46:09.820
As for yesterday, it wasn't that great.

46:09.820 --> 46:14.340
It was kind of one of those dramatic family days.

46:14.340 --> 46:21.820
I did end up seeing a movie that I'll probably talk about later on, but otherwise that's

46:21.820 --> 46:22.820
really all.

46:22.820 --> 46:26.820
Today I bought Taiko Drum Master because I've been kind of... Oh, that's another thing

46:26.820 --> 46:30.740
thing that Jamie and I did on Friday night was I got to play her taiko drum master, which

46:30.740 --> 46:34.940
is so much funner with two people that it's still fun as with one person.

46:34.940 --> 46:35.940
Funner.

46:35.940 --> 46:36.940
Funner.

46:36.940 --> 46:38.460
Yeah, funner is the new word of the day.

46:38.460 --> 46:39.460
So much more fun.

46:39.460 --> 46:40.460
Whatever.

46:40.460 --> 46:41.460
Fuck you.

46:41.460 --> 46:42.460
Smartass.

46:42.460 --> 46:49.160
So anyways, that's how the week was.

46:49.160 --> 46:53.440
You know, I seem to remember that when we moved in together and you're going to be the

46:53.440 --> 46:56.300
roommate and everything, you didn't really like video games an awful lot.

46:56.300 --> 47:00.140
Like, you had a few GameCube games. You liked Metroid, you liked Donkey Konga.

47:00.140 --> 47:02.740
Now you're running out to GameStop. I gotta get Tycho Drum Master!

47:02.740 --> 47:05.620
Well, I mean, Tycho Drum Master's like Donkey Konga.

47:05.620 --> 47:11.220
It's a hell of a lot better than Donkey Konga. It's great, but, you know.

47:11.220 --> 47:16.140
I'm fairly... I'm not so much bad with the video game stuff.

47:16.140 --> 47:20.340
I can get into stuff. I used to be into it when I was little.

47:20.340 --> 47:24.260
You know, I played the Mario Brothers. Thank you.

47:24.260 --> 47:26.260
Oh, no problem for that.

47:26.260 --> 47:27.260
All right.

47:27.260 --> 47:30.260
We're going to go to a quick break, boys and girls, when we come back.

47:30.260 --> 47:32.260
Maybe we'll do some Bahmani news if there's anything going on.

47:32.260 --> 47:35.260
I don't know. I have to look. It's been a long week.

47:35.260 --> 47:39.260
And we'll also get into the Cave Match tonight at some point.

47:39.260 --> 47:40.260
EFUs of the Week.

47:40.260 --> 47:41.260
Oh, I want to talk about this, too.

47:41.260 --> 47:43.260
Listen to our podcast this week, boys and girls,

47:43.260 --> 47:46.260
because we're going to be giving away PSP games.

47:46.260 --> 47:51.260
We're giving away Death Jr. and Coded Arms on this week's podcast.

47:51.260 --> 47:52.260
Isn't that lovely?

47:52.260 --> 47:56.260
So listen to this week's podcast to figure out how to win.

47:56.260 --> 48:00.260

48:00.260 --> 48:04.260
In this break we're going to hear some music from Poppin' Music 13 since Loki was so kind

48:04.260 --> 48:08.260
to remind me we haven't done some of this music yet. We're going to hear a brand new

48:08.260 --> 48:12.260
Sota Fujimori song starting us off with Spring Come Around.

48:12.260 --> 48:16.260

Oh

Oh

49:50.260 --> 49:54.280
Then nay nay nay nay nay nay

49:55.280 --> 49:58.980
Then nay nay nay nay nay nay

50:00.360 --> 50:05.320
Then nay nay nay nay nay nay

50:06.000 --> 50:10.560
Then nay nay nay nay nay nay

50:40.560 --> 50:42.560
Oh

52:40.560 --> 53:08.560
It's just a matter of time, it goes by, it's all a matter of time The moment may have sealed me alive, but I can forget the moment

53:08.560 --> 53:13.560
If I don't get what I was hoping to show to you yet

53:13.560 --> 53:18.560
I wish I had a girl my girl would swear I could

53:18.560 --> 53:21.560
With no faith, or running, or running

53:21.560 --> 53:23.560
She could play her life without me

53:23.560 --> 53:26.560
If I was to change, and it could rise

53:26.560 --> 53:29.560
But I can't take it to be real, I think

53:29.560 --> 53:31.560
If the sun doesn't fly, I won't lose

53:31.560 --> 53:33.560
I can't get back to you

53:33.560 --> 53:37.560
I don't know what it's gonna be if we didn't show

53:37.560 --> 53:39.560
She could think of no light

53:39.560 --> 53:42.560
Looking for the pain inside your face

53:42.560 --> 53:44.560
These memories come all the same

53:44.560 --> 53:46.560
You say you love me

53:46.560 --> 53:47.560
I would know well

53:47.560 --> 53:50.920
Well, you was out here for me, wasn't it?

56:17.560 --> 56:28.600
After this song, we'll be having a Let Them Move marathon.

56:28.600 --> 56:29.600
Noooooo!

56:29.600 --> 56:36.200
Just kidding, Orange Lounge Radio, crap-free Bhavani radio.

56:36.200 --> 56:40.280
We're back here on Orange Lounge Radio, that was some music from Popin' Music 13, I think

56:40.280 --> 56:42.920
they're calling that Carnival, is the subtitle of that.

56:42.920 --> 56:47.180
I haven't followed Popin' Music in a little while, sorry kids, but they don't really have

56:47.180 --> 56:49.280
an arcade machine exactly around the corner

56:49.280 --> 56:52.040
uh... sort of which you more it was spring comes around the little eight

56:52.040 --> 56:53.800
that selling side i cannot actually

56:53.800 --> 56:56.800
it's almost eight that's only what it sounds like an old carter sixty-four

56:56.800 --> 56:59.400
game i kinda dig this track

56:59.400 --> 57:03.740
that site on a with opportunity and uh... deejay taco with moon in there as

57:03.740 --> 57:05.600
well featuring erica

57:05.600 --> 57:06.780
mochi suki

57:06.780 --> 57:10.680
and then does row is the last one there in the track is called

57:10.680 --> 57:13.720
uh... some japanese text after that i can read because it's all garbled on my

57:13.720 --> 57:16.720
computer anyway so son something

57:16.720 --> 57:19.720
And a lot of folks in the chat room are saying,

57:19.720 --> 57:20.720
Hey, it's Daikin Kai!

57:20.720 --> 57:21.720
Well, yeah, it's Desero.

57:21.720 --> 57:22.720
You know what I miss?

57:22.720 --> 57:23.720
What?

57:23.720 --> 57:26.480
I sort of miss letting them move.

57:26.480 --> 57:29.080
I don't think I have that anywhere.

57:29.080 --> 57:31.440
I used to let them move the cow thing.

57:31.440 --> 57:33.840
Yeah, let them move the cow mix.

57:33.840 --> 57:34.840
I have that somewhere.

57:34.840 --> 57:37.960
I'll have to find that.

57:37.960 --> 57:40.400
You know what's interesting is really not a whole lot going on in the music

57:40.400 --> 57:42.580
game scene right now going on.

57:42.580 --> 57:46.180
So God, we're screwed when it comes to a show tonight.

57:46.180 --> 57:50.340
So I guess we have to talk about some other things that are going on in the gaming world.

57:50.340 --> 57:55.780
So one thing that's kind of been brought up time and time again is the Xbox 360, of course

57:55.780 --> 57:58.060
the release dates right around the corner.

57:58.060 --> 58:03.340
And some folks are kind of wondering, what's so great about the Xbox 360?

58:03.340 --> 58:06.840
Should I be going out and picking up one of these Xbox 360s at launch?

58:06.840 --> 58:08.160
Should I wait?

58:08.160 --> 58:09.680
What games are actually going to be released?

58:09.680 --> 58:13.340
And boy, it seems like that launch list of Xbox 360 titles is getting shorter and shorter,

58:13.340 --> 58:14.340
doesn't it?

58:14.340 --> 58:15.340
Yep.

58:15.340 --> 58:19.340
What moved now? Wasn't it Project Gotham Racing, was it?

58:19.340 --> 58:22.340
No, Project Gotham is still there. That's the launch title.

58:22.340 --> 58:25.340
Microsoft's already guaranteed that's going to launch.

58:25.340 --> 58:30.340
That cameo and Perfect Dark Zero are guaranteed to launch.

58:30.340 --> 58:34.340
In fact, they actually pushed them up a week, so now they're coming out November 10th.

58:34.340 --> 58:39.340
Anyways, what did move, though, was Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter,

58:39.340 --> 58:42.340
one of the really cool squad-based first-version shooters that was coming out.

58:42.340 --> 58:52.340
That got pushed all the way back to February, and before that was Framed City Killer put out by Namco, which also got pushed back to February for more tweaking.

58:52.340 --> 58:57.340
I think Ghost Recon, what they're trying to do is finish the 360 stuff so they can launch them all at once.

58:57.340 --> 59:03.340
So that basically eliminated what I was going to try to bring in as one of the first games.

59:03.340 --> 59:07.340
I have a pre-booked gun, which is, you know, Grand Theft Auto and the Wild West,

59:07.340 --> 59:12.540
and then, um, Project Optum 3, which looks amazing from what I've seen in the gameplay footage.

59:12.540 --> 59:16.460
Plus, it has a minigame in it, um, Geometry Wars 2, which looks pretty cool.

59:16.460 --> 59:19.860
Yeah, what the hell is this about the minigame that's in it? Isn't it, like, uh,

59:19.860 --> 59:22.860
frickin', you said it was, like, by the people that did Rez, and...

59:22.860 --> 59:26.700
Well, it's not by the people that did Rez. I said it looks like a cross between Asteroids,

59:26.700 --> 59:32.860
Rez... I got really excited for a minute, and I was like, oh my god, because Rez is one of those titles that was so sexy, and it was, like, completely overlooked.

59:32.860 --> 59:37.580
It is, it looks pretty cool, and apparently Geometry Wars 1 was available as a hidden

59:37.580 --> 59:42.740
game in Project Gotham 2, so you can actually try that out, but what they're doing with

59:42.740 --> 59:49.100
the 360 is they're actually promoting a kind of a homebrew community actually, so you can

59:49.100 --> 59:54.620
have your games developed and put them on this Xbox Live Arcade, is what they're calling

59:54.620 --> 59:56.620
it, so you can download these mini games.

59:56.620 --> 01:00:00.420
So one of them, and it's actually included with the hard drive, which is retarded, but

01:00:00.420 --> 01:00:05.440
is this Hectics, which is created by the guy that did Tetris, and it's kind of a new puzzle

01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:09.540
game. Then there's another one that they showed, which is like a Marble Madness type game called

01:00:09.540 --> 01:00:14.300
Marble Blast. But then this game, though, is going to be coming with Project Gotham

01:00:14.300 --> 01:00:19.500
3, and I've seen gameplay footage of it. I was trying to bring some up to show you guys

01:00:19.500 --> 01:00:25.700
in the studio, but it looks amazing. And I don't know, I think it'd be a perfect PSP

01:00:25.700 --> 01:00:26.700
game.

01:00:26.700 --> 01:00:32.260
I'm worried about all these titles pushing back. It's kinda like Microsoft really, really

01:00:32.260 --> 01:00:35.840
wants the system out this Christmas, come hell. Well, and at this point, they can't

01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:39.080
push back. They really can't. I mean, they'll piss off America if they push the system back

01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:40.640
any further. Well, they're not gonna push the system.

01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:43.760
These games, though, at launch... But what's the point of buying the system

01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:47.160
if there's no games available at launch? There's gonna be, like, 20-some games.

01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:51.940
I know, but nothing that I really want. Well, what are you looking for? I mean, they've

01:00:51.940 --> 01:00:55.280
got stuff... If you're a sports fan, they have tons of sports coming out.

01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:59.660
I'm not much of a sports guitar. I haven't really liked a sports game since, like, Tecmo

01:00:59.660 --> 01:01:00.660
Bowl, okay?

01:01:00.660 --> 01:01:01.660
Yeah.

01:01:01.660 --> 01:01:05.300
And by the way, I picked up that Tecmo collection. I'm going to talk about this again on the

01:01:05.300 --> 01:01:09.100
podcast, but that Tecmo collection, I picked it up for Xbox, and it has the arcade game

01:01:09.100 --> 01:01:14.620
version of Tecmo Bowl on it. So not what I remember. The NES version was so much more

01:01:14.620 --> 01:01:17.020
fluid and fun. Anyway, sorry.

01:01:17.020 --> 01:01:23.560
Anyways, for the 360, if you like sports, definitely going to be a system for you. If

01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:28.280
We want racing games. There's going to be a lot of stuff. Project Gotham, Ridge Racer,

01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:32.080
Need for Speed, Most Wanted. Those are going to be three big ones.

01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:37.400
Carmageddon? No, Carmageddon. Full Auto. Full Auto coming out next year. That one is

01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:42.160
exciting. Put out by Sega. It's like a cross between Twisted Metal and Burnout. And all

01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:46.600
I have to do is mention Burnout. Basically, giant, you know, cars with guns on them, shooting

01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:51.160
each other. You can blow up buildings. Okay, like Spy Hunter on crack. Yeah. Okay, cool.

01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:55.280
Yeah, it's going to be freaking awesome. But anyways, on the end of that one...

01:01:55.280 --> 01:01:59.660
That was the Xbox. That was the problem I had with the Xbox, because it's no secret

01:01:59.660 --> 01:02:03.760
that on this program, because this program's been on long enough, where when we were first

01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:07.520
starting this program, PlayStation 2 was kind of new still, and Xbox was just on its way

01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:12.640
out, and I said, there's no effing way I'm ever going to buy an Xbox, because all the

01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:18.640
Xbox is is sports games, racers... I had an acronym for it.

01:02:18.640 --> 01:02:25.640
It's Sarsy Games. That's it. It's Sars Games. It's Sports, Action, Racing, Shooters.

01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:29.640
Yeah, that's pretty much everything that comes out nowadays, though.

01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:31.640
I guess because that's what sells, but...

01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:37.640
Well, let's put it this way. Okay, RPGs. You've got Cameo, which is sort of an RPG.

01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:39.640
That's really pushing it, but...

01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:40.640
Right.

01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:45.640
And Elder Scrolls, which is just a hardcore RPG.

01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:54.640
Then also, what else we have here? There's Quake 4 for your first-person shooter fans.

01:02:54.640 --> 01:03:04.640
Which I have to admit is something I'm highly interested in. I do like the rare first-person shooter game. I love Halo, for one, that's for sure.

01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:11.640
And then, for your non-mainstream stuff, they've got Tony Hawk's American Wasteland, Gun, which

01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:17.840
is going to be coming out, King Kong, they'll be coming out right afterwards, and then there's

01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:21.600
a dead spill of nothing until about January, I think.

01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:22.600
Interesting.

01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:24.560
And then that's when there's some more games coming out.

01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:26.920
But of course, more stuff will be announced as we get closer.

01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:30.020
Is it going to be like the DS launch, where they kind of blow their load when the system

01:03:30.020 --> 01:03:35.420
first comes out, and then you go through this like, and PSP, oh my god, the PSP. PSP totally

01:03:35.420 --> 01:03:38.140
blew its logo when it first came out, and then six months of nothing.

01:03:38.140 --> 01:03:42.180
Well, look at this way. December is a dead month as far as games coming out anyways for

01:03:42.180 --> 01:03:47.060
all systems. It's just, they push stuff out of, you know, December, and there's like twelve

01:03:47.060 --> 01:03:52.460
games. Total. I mean, that's it. Um, whereas November, two hundred games. You know, it's

01:03:52.460 --> 01:03:55.040
just pretty good. Well, that makes sense though, because everybody's

01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:58.340
trying to get on the Christmas bandwagon, because all the Christmas shopping starts

01:03:58.340 --> 01:04:02.220
the day after Thanksgiving. And I'll be damned if there aren't people to get all of their

01:04:02.220 --> 01:04:03.620
shopping done the day after Thanksgiving.

01:04:03.620 --> 01:04:07.980
Some of us actually get started in mid-year.

01:04:07.980 --> 01:04:12.180
And some of us wait until Christmas Eve Eve to do it. That's me. December 23rd. Every

01:04:12.180 --> 01:04:15.060
year I do my Christmas shopping.

01:04:15.060 --> 01:04:18.980
So the other games, the ones I was going to pick up and launch Project Gotham looks just

01:04:18.980 --> 01:04:22.940
like really amazing. And Ridge Racer wasn't too impressed with because it just looks like

01:04:22.940 --> 01:04:26.780
Ridge Racer. I mean, they haven't really done anything with it. It has the same damn tracks

01:04:26.780 --> 01:04:31.540
in it for one, whereas Project Awesome is so fully realistic. They actually have texturing

01:04:31.540 --> 01:04:36.660
on the glass on the windshield of the car. You can see smudge prints on there. I mean,

01:04:36.660 --> 01:04:38.020
that's how realistic this thing is.

01:04:38.020 --> 01:04:39.020
Bloodstains?

01:04:39.020 --> 01:04:47.860
No, but I'm hoping. I wish, but no. Just really amazing stuff. Quake 4 is going to be awesome.

01:04:47.860 --> 01:04:51.460
Gun is just, I don't even know what gun's going to be. Gun's going to be phenomenal.

01:04:51.460 --> 01:04:54.640
And then, I don't know, I might pick up one more game.

01:04:54.640 --> 01:04:59.640
Sixty bucks for these games. I was looking at EB Games, they have a whole big display trying to get people to pre-order this stuff.

01:04:59.640 --> 01:05:00.640
Sixty-four after tax.

01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:02.640
Sixty bucks a game.

01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:03.640
Yeah.

01:05:03.640 --> 01:05:04.640
Crazy.

01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:08.640
It's lame, but everything I buy is on store credit.

01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:10.640
Right, right.

01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:13.640
Yeah. But, um...

01:05:13.640 --> 01:05:21.640
So a lot of people, you know, we have a lot of younger listeners that listen to this program who don't hold down full-time jobs, so they can't exactly run out and buy a system.

01:05:21.640 --> 01:05:31.640
And please don't get us wrong either. I mean, yes, I have a full time job, but it's hard for me to go out and buy these systems. If gaming wasn't like a huge hobby of mine, I wouldn't be.

01:05:31.640 --> 01:05:40.640
And that's probably the only reason I'm going to buy a 360 on launch is because I feel like I have to to stay on top of what's going on in the industry for the podcast.

01:05:40.640 --> 01:05:45.640
Well, here's what I'm saying here. Don't go out and buy the system if you're unsure if you want it or not.

01:05:45.640 --> 01:05:55.640
The only reason I'm buying one, same reason I bought PSP close to launch, same reason I bought DS, is because I'm a gaming whore and I'll have to, you know, pick this stuff up for two reasons.

01:05:55.640 --> 01:06:02.640
One, to stay on, to have an edge at work, you know, the game sale stuff I do, and just an edge on everything.

01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:12.640
And then also just because I have to get everything, even though, you know, I may not play it like my GameCube, you know, but, um, it just, there's a lot of stuff coming out.

01:06:12.640 --> 01:06:18.380
If you have a PSP, definitely pick one of those up. DS? Tons of stuff for Internet,

01:06:18.380 --> 01:06:19.380
you know?

01:06:19.380 --> 01:06:21.120
Oh, I'm so excited about DS Internet.

01:06:21.120 --> 01:06:23.920
I'm going to have them all anyway.

01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:27.000
I was going to kind of ask you about this because you're kind of a systems whore. You

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:30.720
make no secret about that. You own, like, is there any system that's ever been released

01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:31.720
that you do not own?

01:06:31.720 --> 01:06:35.680
I don't have a CDI. I don't have a Sarah Child Channel app, although Dan has owned one.

01:06:35.680 --> 01:06:36.680
Do you have a 3DO?

01:06:36.680 --> 01:06:37.680
No.

01:06:37.680 --> 01:06:38.680
Okay.

01:06:38.680 --> 01:06:39.680
Don't want a 3DO.

01:06:39.680 --> 01:06:40.680
Yeah, I know. Who wants a 3DO?

01:06:40.680 --> 01:06:44.680
Is there any game on the 3DO that makes that system worth buying? A 1?

01:06:44.680 --> 01:06:48.680
What do I have? I have a Neo Geo, I have a Neo Geo CD.

01:06:48.680 --> 01:06:51.680
If we ask what you do have, it's going to take you all there.

01:06:51.680 --> 01:06:56.680
Yeah, but what I don't have also could take me a lot. The thing that's at the top of my list of what I want right now,

01:06:56.680 --> 01:07:02.680
realistically, is a Duo RX. PC Engine Duo RX.

01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:04.680
Okay, so we know you're going to get a 360 at launch.

01:07:04.680 --> 01:07:07.680
I'm actually wanting the PS3 more.

01:07:07.680 --> 01:07:13.600
There's also the fact that your husband works at GameStop, so you also in your household

01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:17.160
kind of have a need to stay on top of what's going on in the gaming world, right?

01:07:17.160 --> 01:07:20.800
With you doing the radio and him doing the selling of the items in the store.

01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:25.180
We're gonna have all that, and on top of that, any game that comes out, he can basically

01:07:25.180 --> 01:07:26.180
check it out of the store.

01:07:26.180 --> 01:07:29.840
He can play it all we want to and put it back.

01:07:29.840 --> 01:07:30.840
That's cool.

01:07:30.840 --> 01:07:31.840
Not a big deal.

01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:34.040
But you say you're more excited about PS3.

01:07:34.040 --> 01:07:35.040
Yeah.

01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:36.600
Why?

01:07:36.600 --> 01:07:42.560
studied a bit more on the cell processor myself prior to seeing the demo at E3

01:07:42.560 --> 01:07:49.400
and that knowing that there's going to be a new Tekken oh my god and other

01:07:49.400 --> 01:07:55.480
things that I'm more than positive will be out based on things that I've seen

01:07:55.480 --> 01:08:01.400
the Final Fantasy remake the the which I know is still just a rumor but I'm

01:08:01.400 --> 01:08:08.400
convinced it's happening. What was the other thing? The, god damn it, racing game that's

01:08:08.400 --> 01:08:10.800
incredibly, Gran Turismo, thank you, Gran Turismo.

01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:17.240
I'm not as excited about Gran Turismo but Dan is. Just knowing that, and on top of that,

01:08:17.240 --> 01:08:24.680
I really, really hope that people, see, the PlayStation 2 I think would have been better

01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:30.600
had people been more skilled in programming games for it because they didn't, there wasn't

01:08:30.600 --> 01:08:36.300
a lot of I wouldn't say very good use of the channels hence the jaggedy games you

01:08:36.300 --> 01:08:40.600
know like oh let's put in surround sound but not you know make the game look nice

01:08:40.600 --> 01:08:49.160
hello and you know and me I always go for the underdog system myself in you

01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:53.280
know I said I would normally put me on the boat with the revolution however I

01:08:53.280 --> 01:08:59.100
think that the controller is retarded so and the Xbox games I'm really not too

01:08:59.100 --> 01:09:03.380
you excited about anything coming out on 360? I can't knock the Nintendo controller though

01:09:03.380 --> 01:09:08.980
until I get to touch it and play a game and see how it really feels. Racing games, yay.

01:09:08.980 --> 01:09:14.260
Sports games, yay. And that's, to bring it full circle, that's how I felt about the Xbox

01:09:14.260 --> 01:09:17.540
when it first came out, and then sure enough, I got to play it. Well I know that all that's

01:09:17.540 --> 01:09:21.580
going to end up in my house is Project Gotham, and I'm like, I'm tired of damn playing Need

01:09:21.580 --> 01:09:25.860
for Speed Underground 2 all the damn time. He'll bring in Need for Speed Most Wanted

01:09:25.860 --> 01:09:32.900
than Underground 3. Goody-goody. Yay! Oh, gee, you know. Finally, I caved and I bought

01:09:32.900 --> 01:09:37.740
an Xbox when Halo, I finally got to play Halo for the first time and I was like, wow, this

01:09:37.740 --> 01:09:42.700
is a shooter I actually really enjoy. And Halo 2, of course, the DDR on Xbox, which

01:09:42.700 --> 01:09:49.780
I still believe the UltraMix 2 is the best DDR game they put out, period. And there's

01:09:49.780 --> 01:09:55.060
another Fable I actually kind of enjoy a little bit. And all that, you know, is on Xbox. And

01:09:55.060 --> 01:09:59.900
And so Xbox finally kind of grew out of the SARS games for me.

01:09:59.900 --> 01:10:05.180
On top of that, I'm probably going to be getting an import PS3 as well, because I know that

01:10:05.180 --> 01:10:09.900
there are going to be more games coming out overseas on the PS3 than there will be on

01:10:09.900 --> 01:10:11.420
the Xbox 360.

01:10:11.420 --> 01:10:12.420
I want to bring this up.

01:10:12.420 --> 01:10:15.540
I've been wanting to bring this topic up on the show for like two weeks, and now it just

01:10:15.540 --> 01:10:16.540
hit me.

01:10:16.540 --> 01:10:20.700
You saying this reminded me to bring this up.

01:10:20.700 --> 01:10:23.820
Obviously we've been to E3, so we've talked to a lot of people in the industry, and we

01:10:23.820 --> 01:10:27.540
we continue to talk to some of those people. And I was having a very interesting conversation

01:10:27.540 --> 01:10:31.700
with somebody who works in the industry, not that long ago, and this person was saying

01:10:31.700 --> 01:10:39.100
that there was a game that the company wanted to bring out that had a lot of hype going

01:10:39.100 --> 01:10:44.660
forward in Japan, I think. The game, you know, was something that some people in Japan are

01:10:44.660 --> 01:10:50.940
looking forward to, and they wanted to bring it out here. But I guess Sony gets some type

01:10:50.940 --> 01:10:55.220
of approval over what games actually come out for the system, and Sony rejected the

01:10:55.220 --> 01:11:02.220
game, saying it's too Japanese. That's stupid. And I'm thinking, what? You rejected a game

01:11:02.220 --> 01:11:07.500
because it's too Japanese? And then my second thought is, how in the fuck did Katamari Damacy

01:11:07.500 --> 01:11:14.260
ever come out in this country? Even better, why did it sell better here than there? Which

01:11:14.260 --> 01:11:19.860
is true. I, I, that boggled my mind. From what I understand the game cut even in Japan,

01:11:19.860 --> 01:11:24.440
here it's like oversold no one likes Japanese stuff I mean that's why you

01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:30.760
know all you see all these networks like g4 TV oh I don't know you know cartoon

01:11:30.760 --> 01:11:36.280
network all this stuff you know they're of course not playing any anime of any

01:11:36.280 --> 01:11:40.920
sort whatsoever so obviously no one likes the Japanese culture at all I mean

01:11:40.920 --> 01:11:44.120
that's why you don't see people out there you know buying anime from their

01:11:44.120 --> 01:11:48.360
GameStop or you know buying all these anime games that come out because

01:11:48.360 --> 01:11:51.120
There's no interest whatsoever in anime at all.

01:11:51.120 --> 01:11:55.000
And I can see where maybe Sony wants some type of quality control over the games, but

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:58.280
then I think, my God, why did Driver 3 come out?

01:11:58.280 --> 01:12:04.560
All they need, all that they need, well actually Sony right now is hiring for localization,

01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:09.560
for localization people, which leads me to think that, you know, I was taking that as

01:12:09.560 --> 01:12:13.600
a positive sign for a little while, hoping that they were saying, hey, you know, these

01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:17.600
import games are, are, you know, doing really big in the States.

01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:20.760
They've got a big, you know, how else did we get DDR here?

01:12:20.760 --> 01:12:25.120
What? I don't understand... That's also a good question, and now BeatMania on its way out too.

01:12:25.120 --> 01:12:29.200
I understand how they could reject a game because it's too Japanese anyways. So if the game's too Japanese,

01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:33.680
then it won't sell, then that company won't make any money. At least it's not crap, so it's not,

01:12:33.680 --> 01:12:36.760
you know, gonna make your system look bad. I don't get it.

01:12:36.760 --> 01:12:42.360
It should really take DDR as the example, you know. How many people think, oh, dancing aim, you know, too

01:12:42.360 --> 01:12:43.440
Japanese for the

01:12:43.440 --> 01:12:48.080
the United States, but we have our friend at Konami who kept pushing and pushing and

01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:49.080
pushing and...

01:12:49.080 --> 01:12:50.080
Mr. Enos.

01:12:50.080 --> 01:12:51.080
Exactly.

01:12:51.080 --> 01:12:52.080
Absolutely.

01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:56.640
And lo and behold, we have DDR now, and we also have cheap knock-offs.

01:12:56.640 --> 01:13:01.640
Well, an interesting follow-up to that is that the same person said that since that

01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:07.300
game's not going to come out here for the PlayStation now, that a different form...

01:13:07.300 --> 01:13:10.820
I obviously really don't want to give this away because of the nature of the story, but

01:13:10.820 --> 01:13:16.820
a different type of game in the series will be coming out on Xbox, on a Microsoft console.

01:13:16.820 --> 01:13:21.060
I don't remember if it was Xbox or Xbox 360, so it's going to come out on a Microsoft console.

01:13:21.060 --> 01:13:23.260
Because Microsoft apparently does not really give a shit.

01:13:23.260 --> 01:13:25.940
They're just excited to have people putting games out on their system.

01:13:25.940 --> 01:13:28.480
And I was kind of like, wow, that's kind of a...

01:13:28.480 --> 01:13:33.220
I understand the need to have quality control over your system, but some real shit comes

01:13:33.220 --> 01:13:34.220
out for those systems.

01:13:34.220 --> 01:13:35.220
I mean, really.

01:13:35.220 --> 01:13:36.220
Really.

01:13:36.220 --> 01:13:39.140
The chaff.

01:13:39.140 --> 01:13:42.900
Have you seen some of those budget titles they have now for PlayStation 1?

01:13:42.900 --> 01:13:45.580
Maybe they let those come out because they don't care anymore?

01:13:45.580 --> 01:13:48.020
Like the five and ten dollar Walmart games?

01:13:48.020 --> 01:13:57.700
The Texas Hold'em 50,000 incarnation of the PopCap games?

01:13:57.700 --> 01:14:03.300
Things you can play for free on the internet on Flash coming out for Game Boy Advance and

01:14:03.300 --> 01:14:04.300
PlayStation.

01:14:04.300 --> 01:14:05.300
Bejeweled again!

01:14:05.300 --> 01:14:11.580
Snood came out on the Game Boy Advance, if you'll recall, which is, I think, a cheaper

01:14:11.580 --> 01:14:14.080
problem for us to move.

01:14:14.080 --> 01:14:15.080
Interesting comment in the chat room.

01:14:15.080 --> 01:14:19.580
A float walk is in there saying, Katamari sells, because getting high and tripping out

01:14:19.580 --> 01:14:20.580
are universal.

01:14:20.580 --> 01:14:23.380
Yeah, I just get motion sick.

01:14:23.380 --> 01:14:24.380
Very interesting feedback there.

01:14:24.380 --> 01:14:28.460
Of course, our chat room, once again, www.orangeloungeradio.com.

01:14:28.460 --> 01:14:29.460
Click on Chat.

01:14:29.460 --> 01:14:32.700
And then we also have another way you can interact with our program, and that is the

01:14:32.700 --> 01:14:37.600
the skype line where we actually will talk to you live on air. That's www.orangelandrater.com

01:14:37.600 --> 01:14:42.640
click on interact with us and the skype line it's open right now. So if you want to call

01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:47.460
in we're opening that up. Not a whole lot of people signed into skype tonight so I'm

01:14:47.460 --> 01:14:51.640
thinking maybe we're going to have a dry night of skype calls. I don't know what's going

01:14:51.640 --> 01:14:55.860
on though that people would. People freaking call or we set you on fire and do nothing

01:14:55.860 --> 01:14:59.860
about talk about Britney Spears' baby.

01:14:59.860 --> 01:15:02.860
No, I don't want to. Didn't you do that last week?

01:15:02.860 --> 01:15:04.860
Okay, let's have Britney Spears do section chat.

01:15:04.860 --> 01:15:09.860
Ew, gross. God. I would rather go back to talking about the sheepskin con.

01:15:09.860 --> 01:15:13.860
She's worried that her scar won't go away.

01:15:13.860 --> 01:15:15.860
Poor thing.

01:15:15.860 --> 01:15:18.860
You know, and of course she spoke the whole time. She carried a rat.

01:15:18.860 --> 01:15:21.860
Hey, look at that. We've got to call them. Just for you, Dark Sakura.

01:15:21.860 --> 01:15:24.860
It's our regular caller on the line.

01:15:24.860 --> 01:15:26.860
How are you?

01:15:26.860 --> 01:15:27.860
Huh?

01:15:27.860 --> 01:15:28.860
Hello?

01:15:28.860 --> 01:15:29.860
Yeah.

01:15:29.860 --> 01:15:31.860
You on Orange One Radio?

01:15:31.860 --> 01:15:33.860
Who's this?

01:15:33.860 --> 01:15:34.860
Yeah?

01:15:34.860 --> 01:15:35.860
Do you think?

01:15:35.860 --> 01:15:37.860
Obviously you know who it is.

01:15:37.860 --> 01:15:39.860
Yes, it's the Legend of Zaku everybody.

01:15:39.860 --> 01:15:42.860
How are you, my friend?

01:15:42.860 --> 01:15:45.860
I'm just, you know, waiting for another, you know,

01:15:45.860 --> 01:15:48.860
just waiting for my Yankees to just finish up the Angels

01:15:48.860 --> 01:15:51.860
so we could take it, we could take it to their, you know,

01:15:51.860 --> 01:15:55.380
you know we could take the game to their place tomorrow and and win what's what's

01:15:55.380 --> 01:15:58.420
baseball what what is the baseball i'm watching

01:15:58.420 --> 01:16:03.620
it's the number one sport in japan ever i'm on the box i love yeah my yankees

01:16:03.620 --> 01:16:07.540
are you know yankees basically are up there

01:16:07.540 --> 01:16:12.500
in breathing and love making i know how it is because in this town where we live

01:16:12.500 --> 01:16:14.980
they don't have a well they do have a minor league baseball team but they have

01:16:14.980 --> 01:16:19.460
a really big basketball team and i swear to god everywhere you go it's kings

01:16:19.460 --> 01:16:23.460
Kings! Kings! Go Kings! We love the Kings! Ahhh!

01:16:23.460 --> 01:16:24.460
Oh, not the Kings.

01:16:24.460 --> 01:16:29.460
And I'm all like, you know, I left Alabama to get over the Auburn, Alabama fixation,

01:16:29.460 --> 01:16:30.460
and I come out here and it's like,

01:16:30.460 --> 01:16:31.460
Yankees don't suck.

01:16:31.460 --> 01:16:32.460
Wings! Wings!

01:16:32.460 --> 01:16:35.460
Whoever the hell's saying that in the chatroom, Yankees do not suck.

01:16:35.460 --> 01:16:36.460
Boston sucks.

01:16:36.460 --> 01:16:41.460
Zaku, tell me something video game related, please. What's on your mind?

01:16:41.460 --> 01:16:46.460
Uh, Digital Life starts this Friday, so I'm heading there this Saturday.

01:16:46.460 --> 01:16:50.820
I don't know if I'm going to compete in freestyle because I'm having second thoughts.

01:16:50.820 --> 01:16:54.660
The fact that I don't have any money to prepare for a really good one is just making it worse.

01:16:54.660 --> 01:16:59.220
Zaku, I've judged DDR freestyle competitions in my day.

01:16:59.220 --> 01:17:04.700
I haven't done one in a long-ass time, nobody's ass, but I've judged a few, and trust me Zaku,

01:17:04.700 --> 01:17:07.100
you couldn't be as bad as some of the ones I've seen in my life.

01:17:07.100 --> 01:17:11.900
I know, I've done it before, I've done a really good one even though I DQ'd, but this year

01:17:11.900 --> 01:17:17.900
You know, in the tournament this year, they're using an impartial jury.

01:17:17.900 --> 01:17:22.900
In other words, they're using people that don't know shit about DER.

01:17:22.900 --> 01:17:25.900
Does that mean you're going to have a horribly scored tournament?

01:17:25.900 --> 01:17:34.900
No, because last year, the judges were biased and basically handed people victories where they should have won.

01:17:34.900 --> 01:17:39.900
No, no, no, no. That's why you have equal representation.

01:17:39.900 --> 01:17:46.900
let me finish before you go jumping all over me

01:17:47.040 --> 01:17:51.260
that's why you need equal representation you need a certain number of people

01:17:51.260 --> 01:17:53.280
who know

01:17:53.280 --> 01:17:55.160
what good freestyle is

01:17:55.160 --> 01:17:59.460
you need people who you need at least one freestyle winner in there

01:17:59.460 --> 01:18:02.220
and you need to have two people on there

01:18:02.220 --> 01:18:06.060
who may not have competed in DDR but people who

01:18:06.060 --> 01:18:07.540
you know

01:18:07.540 --> 01:18:11.920
trust to be impartial, and I think that you do need to have judges who have not actually

01:18:11.920 --> 01:18:12.920
played.

01:18:12.920 --> 01:18:13.920
I agree with the mix.

01:18:13.920 --> 01:18:14.920
I agree with the mix.

01:18:14.920 --> 01:18:19.520
We did have that last year, and it failed, because that ended up doing more harm than

01:18:19.520 --> 01:18:20.520
good.

01:18:20.520 --> 01:18:21.520
We had everything that we said, Jamie.

01:18:21.520 --> 01:18:22.520
Really?

01:18:22.520 --> 01:18:24.760
That's what I've done before, and I've had success.

01:18:24.760 --> 01:18:26.760
That has to do with the people.

01:18:26.760 --> 01:18:28.900
Yeah, because we have to play it safe.

01:18:28.900 --> 01:18:33.120
We don't want any bullshit, and we don't want any bullshit from other people saying that

01:18:33.120 --> 01:18:35.800
they got screwed over, that they should have won.

01:18:35.800 --> 01:18:42.800
I heard the stories of people acting very biased in the judging.

01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:45.800
Those people should never get asked to judge in the first place.

01:18:45.800 --> 01:18:48.800
I guess it's our only choice.

01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:55.800
Another thing, also in digital life, they're going to be debuting Guitar Hero over there,

01:18:55.800 --> 01:18:59.800
so hopefully I'll be able to play it this Saturday.

01:18:59.800 --> 01:19:06.200
Well, by next Sunday I should be able to let you know of how it is, to give you like the...

01:19:06.200 --> 01:19:10.620
I really wish we were able to get a sneak peek at Guitar Hero 2, but you know, sometimes

01:19:10.620 --> 01:19:13.680
we just, you know, don't get our way.

01:19:13.680 --> 01:19:19.560
Hopefully, as I said, you know, I still have time to register for Freestyle, but at this

01:19:19.560 --> 01:19:24.560
point, I wish I had the money to really, you know, really invest on something, you know,

01:19:24.560 --> 01:19:27.200
something memorable and something that will even give me odds.

01:19:27.200 --> 01:19:36.200
I wish I could have gone to Digital Life. I would have judged you a fair tournament, I swear.

01:19:36.200 --> 01:19:37.200
I know, man.

01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:40.200
I'm going to let you go because we have other people who want to get in.

01:19:40.200 --> 01:19:41.200
But have a good night, Zaku, okay?

01:19:41.200 --> 01:19:42.200
All right, man.

01:19:42.200 --> 01:19:43.200
All right, later.

01:19:43.200 --> 01:19:44.200
All right, later.

01:19:44.200 --> 01:19:46.200
Our regular caller there, Zaku, getting in there.

01:19:46.200 --> 01:19:48.200
Getting a little heated there with DarkSacker about the judging.

01:19:48.200 --> 01:19:51.200
You know, I remember we were planning the very, very first tournament.

01:19:51.200 --> 01:19:54.200
We've done that at every tournament we've run, and it's always worked.

01:19:54.200 --> 01:19:57.920
worked we were we we did have that mix I remember scat in particular we have

01:19:57.920 --> 01:20:01.040
like a mix of people and actually one person we were trying to get for the

01:20:01.040 --> 01:20:04.000
longest time unfortunately had to back out at the last minute we were actually

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:07.000
trying to get a dance teacher yeah and be a judge I remember that cuz he's a

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:10.880
friend of mine so I that would have been great I think that's a good good person

01:20:10.880 --> 01:20:14.680
to get to judge your tournament but anyway moving on let's see what the next

01:20:14.680 --> 01:20:21.680
and

01:20:24.920 --> 01:20:28.400
uh... your microphone on caller

01:20:28.400 --> 01:20:32.740
can you have a throw it's a new caller calling in so i think maybe it's not

01:20:32.740 --> 01:20:33.760
working right

01:20:33.760 --> 01:20:38.120
but uh... echo one to be added to that go one to three a car and try a stack

01:20:38.120 --> 01:20:39.800
righty have gone

01:20:39.800 --> 01:20:43.840
so you gotta remember guys uh... before you call in the first time it might is

01:20:43.840 --> 01:20:48.760
is always a good idea to call. There's a username on Skype, Echo123. Make sure you can hear

01:20:48.760 --> 01:20:51.700
yourself. But, you know, that kind of stuff is bound to happen. We appreciate the new

01:20:51.700 --> 01:20:55.720
people who are at least trying to get through. Not that we don't like hearing from the regulars,

01:20:55.720 --> 01:21:00.480
but, you know, new blood once in a while is a good thing. Let's go to, oh damn, our lines

01:21:00.480 --> 01:21:03.560
are lighting up here. Let's go to another call. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

01:21:03.560 --> 01:21:08.900
Hey, Sky, it's El Mullet calling. El Mullet, how the hell have you been?

01:21:08.900 --> 01:21:11.960
I have been doing pretty damn good, Sky. How about yourself?

01:21:11.960 --> 01:21:17.260
Good! I have not heard from you in like three months. Where you been?

01:21:17.260 --> 01:21:20.800
I dropped off the face of the earth. Funny story, but we'll get to that in a minute.

01:21:20.800 --> 01:21:25.020
Okay, well what's on your mind? What do we owe this call to today?

01:21:25.020 --> 01:21:29.840
I think I missed the initial hullabaloo on Xtreme 2, and just want to offer my input

01:21:29.840 --> 01:21:32.420
on it. Sure, yeah. A lot of people really appreciate

01:21:32.420 --> 01:21:36.240
your input, because of course you write reviews, and of course I'll let you get your plug.

01:21:36.240 --> 01:21:39.240
Are you still working for those guys? Yes, I am. I am.

01:21:39.240 --> 01:21:42.840
I'll let you work in your plug there, but a lot of folks in the Bomani scene really

01:21:42.840 --> 01:21:48.720
trust your reviews on the game, so I'm very curious to hear your thoughts on Extreme 2.

01:21:48.720 --> 01:21:50.980
Extreme 2 really impressed me.

01:21:50.980 --> 01:21:56.640
Maybe not as much as a song list, a song list was great anyway, but the presentation really

01:21:56.640 --> 01:21:58.060
impressed me.

01:21:58.060 --> 01:22:06.620
The fact that Dance Master mode is now the official mode of the game, it's more like

01:22:06.620 --> 01:22:09.080
other games you know like

01:22:09.080 --> 01:22:10.280
if they'd like to

01:22:10.280 --> 01:22:14.080
this uh... this is what i said about last week amor is that it feels less

01:22:14.080 --> 01:22:18.260
like an arcade port and more like a playstation game

01:22:18.260 --> 01:22:21.620
as opposed to trying to copy exactly what's going on in the arcade

01:22:21.620 --> 01:22:24.200
having to dance master will be the simply makes it feel more like

01:22:24.200 --> 01:22:25.960
something this for

01:22:25.960 --> 01:22:30.000
the home and since we're not getting a new arcade mix anytime soon it's kind of

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:31.760
interesting to see the

01:22:31.760 --> 01:22:34.320
franchise really now for the first time

01:22:34.320 --> 01:22:36.520
in america kind of growing out of that

01:22:36.520 --> 01:22:37.920
So it's kind of neat.

01:22:37.920 --> 01:22:39.240
Yeah, exactly.

01:22:39.240 --> 01:22:40.840
And also the background movies.

01:22:40.840 --> 01:22:45.040
I cannot get enough of all of these new movies, especially since there's so many

01:22:45.040 --> 01:22:48.240
exclusive movies for a particular song.

01:22:48.240 --> 01:22:52.500
I mean, Daikin Kai jumped like a million points for me.

01:22:52.500 --> 01:22:55.000
I play that for the movie.

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:56.000
It's got some great video.

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:59.600
I still have yet to see some of the ones, like the one for Sakurai here is really good,

01:22:59.600 --> 01:23:02.520
and some of the other ones, because I haven't played enough Dance Master Mode.

01:23:02.520 --> 01:23:06.120
Believe it or not, I'm actually playing Dance Master Mode on a pad.

01:23:06.120 --> 01:23:10.040
So I'm getting flow for some of them.

01:23:10.040 --> 01:23:16.400
Yeah, it took me a week to unlock all the songs.

01:23:16.400 --> 01:23:21.280
I ended up with like 73, then I took a break for a few days, and then I came back to it

01:23:21.280 --> 01:23:24.240
and unlocked Survivor Max.

01:23:24.240 --> 01:23:26.480
Have you had a chance to play the online mode?

01:23:26.480 --> 01:23:28.640
Unfortunately no, not yet.

01:23:28.640 --> 01:23:33.600
I've tried to find time for it, but things keep popping up, and I'd rather be unlocking

01:23:33.600 --> 01:23:37.080
courses and whatnot because I'm an unlock whore.

01:23:37.080 --> 01:23:38.960
Right, right.

01:23:38.960 --> 01:23:43.760
Although, is it true or not, I haven't really heard any follow-up on this.

01:23:43.760 --> 01:23:47.200
Some rumors are going around that the game will give you pity unlocks.

01:23:47.200 --> 01:23:50.240
If you go for a long time without unlocking anything that it finally just starts giving

01:23:50.240 --> 01:23:51.240
them to you.

01:23:51.240 --> 01:23:55.960
Yes, I can confirm that you will get pity stuff showing up in the shop for no particular

01:23:55.960 --> 01:23:56.960
reason.

01:23:56.960 --> 01:23:57.960
Great.

01:23:57.960 --> 01:24:03.960
say this because I go back and I do the extra arrow missions and the

01:24:03.960 --> 01:24:08.580
alternate conditions and as I'm doing that and unlocking the hidden missions

01:24:08.580 --> 01:24:14.320
I'm getting a bunch of songs appear in the shop and it's really interesting

01:24:14.320 --> 01:24:21.680
because I ended up unlocking all the characters at one point and once

01:24:21.680 --> 01:24:26.680
I unlocked my last character a bunch of songs showed

01:24:26.680 --> 01:24:30.440
up for no reason. I noticed a bunch of songs randomly showed

01:24:30.440 --> 01:24:34.600
up in my shop too, so, you know, for those folks that are getting angsty with Dance Master

01:24:34.600 --> 01:24:37.560
Mode, just keep trying, and the game will pity you eventually, and you'll start getting

01:24:37.560 --> 01:24:40.240
some cool songs. Exactly.

01:24:40.240 --> 01:24:43.160
One other thing, well first of all, go ahead and give your site a plug, because it's been

01:24:43.160 --> 01:24:49.160
a little while. www.insidepulse.com. We are reviewing games,

01:24:49.160 --> 01:24:51.200
kicking ass, and taking names. Hey, that rhymes.

01:24:51.200 --> 01:24:53.880
Sounds good. And you also do, like, it's not just games,

01:24:53.880 --> 01:24:55.720
but there's there's raslin

01:24:55.720 --> 01:24:57.000
and there's uh...

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.640
uh... there's movies and tvs and all that stuff

01:24:59.640 --> 01:25:05.200
so uh... movies and tvs music uh... comic books and action figures the whole

01:25:05.200 --> 01:25:07.540
night never grow up everything nerdy

01:25:07.540 --> 01:25:09.120
everything they just call that

01:25:09.120 --> 01:25:12.640
be a nerd dot com because everything that he

01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:16.040
it's pop culture i know i have to add

01:25:16.040 --> 01:25:20.520
series two of the uh... invader zim figurines are out now and that made me

01:25:20.520 --> 01:25:23.240
extremely excited. Thank you for that completely random footnote.

01:25:23.240 --> 01:25:26.760
Are they, um, you know, in action figures? Yes.

01:25:26.760 --> 01:25:30.400
See what I mean? Nerds! All of you! Nerds!

01:25:30.400 --> 01:25:36.120
No, no, you want to talk about Nerds? It's a conversation that I had at Lions about grammar.

01:25:36.120 --> 01:25:40.920
I know, I know. Here we are all sitting on the radio show we've been doing about

01:25:40.920 --> 01:25:44.560
DDR for the past three and a half years.

01:25:44.560 --> 01:25:48.920
Anyway, um, I'm curious also, I have to let you go soon because we're still getting a

01:25:48.920 --> 01:25:50.400
bunch of other calls, but, um,

01:25:50.400 --> 01:25:53.640
What I want to ask you about real quick, you know, as somebody who reviews games and has

01:25:53.640 --> 01:25:57.460
been doing it for a little while, what do you think about this whole Xbox 360 thing?

01:25:57.460 --> 01:25:59.240
Are you going to pick one up at launch?

01:25:59.240 --> 01:26:04.660
No, I'm not, because for one, I don't like a pricing structure in order to get the good

01:26:04.660 --> 01:26:12.640
system with the hard drive, I have to drop an extra hundred bucks, and so far the games,

01:26:12.640 --> 01:26:18.000
especially the launch window, outside of Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion, there's really not much

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:21.300
I'm looking forward to that I can't play on my normal Xbox.

01:26:21.300 --> 01:26:23.300
Oh, there you have it.

01:26:23.300 --> 01:26:25.800
All right. Well, Elmoet, thanks so much for calling in.

01:26:25.800 --> 01:26:28.800
It's really good to hear from you. Don't be a stranger, all right?

01:26:28.800 --> 01:26:29.300
All right.

01:26:29.300 --> 01:26:32.800
And when's that EX2 review going to be up?

01:26:32.800 --> 01:26:36.000
Hopefully during this week, if I can manage it.

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:37.500
All right, sounds good.

01:26:37.500 --> 01:26:40.400
Elmoet from InsidePulse.com, thank you so much for calling in.

01:26:40.400 --> 01:26:42.200
Have a good week, okay?

01:26:42.200 --> 01:26:42.600
You too.

01:26:42.600 --> 01:26:44.800
All right, later.

01:26:44.800 --> 01:26:46.000
We're going to go to another call now.

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:49.700
Now let's go to, I want to pick up somebody new here, this one's been trying to get in

01:26:49.700 --> 01:26:50.700
for a little while here.

01:26:50.700 --> 01:26:52.700
Hello, you're on Orange Lawn's radio!

01:26:52.700 --> 01:26:55.740
Oops, did I actually answer the call?

01:26:55.740 --> 01:26:56.740
Probably not.

01:26:56.740 --> 01:26:57.740
Hello?

01:26:57.740 --> 01:27:00.400
Did I pick both of them up?

01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:05.100
I picked up the wrong, oh that's right, hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio!

01:27:05.100 --> 01:27:06.100
Hello!

01:27:06.100 --> 01:27:09.460
This is the one whose connection wasn't working quite right earlier.

01:27:09.460 --> 01:27:14.580
Still can't hear you buddy, still can't hear you buddy, try it again, alright?

01:27:14.580 --> 01:27:19.580
Um, let's- Oh, damn. There was the one I was gonna pick up. Let's pick up...

01:27:21.580 --> 01:27:23.580
I don't see that one coming in.

01:27:24.580 --> 01:27:25.580
Let's pick up this one.

01:27:25.580 --> 01:27:27.580
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio!

01:27:29.580 --> 01:27:31.580
Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio!

01:27:33.580 --> 01:27:34.580
Hello?

01:27:34.580 --> 01:27:35.580
Hello!

01:27:35.580 --> 01:27:36.580
Hello!

01:27:36.580 --> 01:27:37.580
Hi!

01:27:39.580 --> 01:27:40.080
Can you hear me?

01:27:40.080 --> 01:27:40.580
Hi!

01:27:40.580 --> 01:27:42.580
Hi! You're on Orange Lounge Radio!

01:27:42.580 --> 01:27:49.580
Um, I'm... I think... is this Ross?

01:27:49.580 --> 01:27:52.580
Massive lag. No, this isn't Ross, this is somebody else.

01:27:52.580 --> 01:27:53.580
Hello?

01:27:53.580 --> 01:27:58.580
Hi, I think there's massive lag. What's on your mind? And we'll answer your question or whatever's on your mind. Tell us what's up.

01:27:58.580 --> 01:28:05.580
We have to wait a little bit for the lag here. Let's see what this person has to say.

01:28:05.580 --> 01:28:06.580
Hi.

01:28:06.580 --> 01:28:07.580
Hi.

01:28:07.580 --> 01:28:11.580
Um, well, is it working?

01:28:11.580 --> 01:28:16.580
Yes, it's working. Hurry up and ask your question. What's on your mind? Just ask your question. What's up?

01:28:16.580 --> 01:28:28.580
Well, I don't play music games that much, but I don't know what you're talking about.

01:28:28.580 --> 01:28:36.580
Well, this is Orange Lounge Radio. Our Sunday night program was actually, the station kind of started, it has to do with, you know,

01:28:36.580 --> 01:28:41.020
you know, because the name Orange Lounge actually comes from music-based video games, and that's

01:28:41.020 --> 01:28:46.220
kind of how we grew into kind of what we're doing here, is that we started by talking

01:28:46.220 --> 01:28:47.220
about music video games.

01:28:47.220 --> 01:28:54.100
So this Sunday night show that we do is kind of a throwback to the music-based video games.

01:28:54.100 --> 01:28:56.500
And the podcast was something extra that we added.

01:28:56.500 --> 01:28:59.660
I'm assuming this is somebody who's listening to this show because of the podcast.

01:28:59.660 --> 01:29:02.860
The podcast was something we added a little extra because we wanted to talk about general

01:29:02.860 --> 01:29:03.860
gaming as well.

01:29:03.860 --> 01:29:07.980
But this show is still kind of basically based around the music games.

01:29:07.980 --> 01:29:11.340
So we do like to talk about other really random stuff once in a while, too, though.

01:29:11.340 --> 01:29:15.620
So it's not 100% music games, but we really owe it to our fans who have supported us for

01:29:15.620 --> 01:29:16.620
the past three and a half years.

01:29:16.620 --> 01:29:22.620
We do like to stay on what's going on in the DDR and in the music gaming scene.

01:29:22.620 --> 01:29:27.620
And music games could be anything from Parappa the Rapper to DDR, Dance Dance Revolution

01:29:27.620 --> 01:29:33.820
to Beatmania, Guitar Hero, Guitar Man, just about anything that involves music and gaming.

01:29:33.820 --> 01:29:35.500
Ryan Robb likes to talk a lot.

01:29:35.500 --> 01:29:36.820
I do, I really do.

01:29:36.820 --> 01:29:37.660
And people listen.

01:29:37.660 --> 01:29:39.180
Anyway, that person hung up.

01:29:39.180 --> 01:29:42.980
So you know, I think there was just too much lag there.

01:29:42.980 --> 01:29:44.260
But you know, people listen.

01:29:44.260 --> 01:29:45.100
You might learn something.

01:29:45.100 --> 01:29:47.820
And I'll tell you what, just like any genre of video games,

01:29:47.820 --> 01:29:49.740
there's really, really good music games out there

01:29:49.740 --> 01:29:50.820
that you should check out.

01:29:50.820 --> 01:29:52.860
And there's really bad ones that you should just

01:29:52.860 --> 01:29:54.060
frickin' avoid at all costs.

01:29:54.060 --> 01:29:55.340
Low-key, just don't even bother.

01:29:55.340 --> 01:29:56.860
We all know what you're going to say.

01:29:56.860 --> 01:29:58.580
All right, this is the one you wanted to talk to, Darksyra.

01:29:58.580 --> 01:29:59.260
Yep.

01:29:59.260 --> 01:30:04.020
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio!

01:30:04.020 --> 01:30:07.060
Hello, you are on Orange Lounge Radio!

01:30:07.060 --> 01:30:08.660
Can you hear us?

01:30:08.660 --> 01:30:13.860
Turn down your speakers! If you can hear us, we cannot hear you, my friend.

01:30:13.860 --> 01:30:16.700
Wait, wait, wait. I'm going to send an IM real quick.

01:30:16.700 --> 01:30:19.580
Just a reminder, because we had a lot of new people calling in tonight,

01:30:19.580 --> 01:30:21.720
maybe somebody can post this in the chat room as well.

01:30:21.720 --> 01:30:25.860
The first time, before the first time you call, it's always a good idea to call.

01:30:25.860 --> 01:30:28.140
It's a username on Skype, Echo,

01:30:28.140 --> 01:30:32.200
one two three and then that we can test your connection and see if you can hear

01:30:32.200 --> 01:30:34.500
yourself because it's a really good way to test the connection

01:30:34.500 --> 01:30:37.980
let me try one more time here are you there young

01:30:37.980 --> 01:30:40.720
can you hear us

01:30:40.720 --> 01:30:42.240
hello hi

01:30:42.240 --> 01:30:43.960
with that

01:30:43.960 --> 01:30:45.120
uh... this is for us

01:30:45.120 --> 01:30:50.280
hi ross what's on your mind

01:30:50.280 --> 01:30:52.220
this time

01:30:52.220 --> 01:30:55.580
how you doing what do you think you got a question for us well what are you

01:30:55.580 --> 01:30:56.580
I'm calling in about tonight.

01:30:56.580 --> 01:30:57.580
You can't hear us.

01:30:57.580 --> 01:30:58.580
You can't hear me.

01:30:58.580 --> 01:31:01.580
I can hear you.

01:31:01.580 --> 01:31:02.580
Oh.

01:31:02.580 --> 01:31:05.580
Is the call lagged by like 45 seconds?

01:31:05.580 --> 01:31:06.580
I don't know.

01:31:06.580 --> 01:31:07.580
I don't know.

01:31:07.580 --> 01:31:08.580
Maybe we're a little lagged.

01:31:08.580 --> 01:31:11.580
I think the call was incredibly lagged here, because I think she's just now getting the

01:31:11.580 --> 01:31:12.580
stuff we said in the beginning.

01:31:12.580 --> 01:31:14.580
Roz, I'm going to have to let you go for it right now.

01:31:14.580 --> 01:31:17.580
I'm really sorry, but try calling us back in a little while.

01:31:17.580 --> 01:31:18.580
Something's up with the connection tonight.

01:31:18.580 --> 01:31:19.580
I don't know what's going on.

01:31:19.580 --> 01:31:20.580
Yeah, I'm still here.

01:31:20.580 --> 01:31:21.580
Yeah.

01:31:21.580 --> 01:31:22.580
Mm-hmm.

01:31:22.580 --> 01:31:26.140
Maybe she'll get to the question.

01:31:26.140 --> 01:31:28.700
The question part should be coming up now on the call.

01:31:28.700 --> 01:31:30.500
Live radio, everybody.

01:31:30.500 --> 01:31:32.420
Yeah.

01:31:32.420 --> 01:31:33.540
Yeah, she's getting lag.

01:31:33.540 --> 01:31:35.120
OK, I figure it's probably really lag.

01:31:40.120 --> 01:31:41.860
OK, we're going to have to go ahead and let

01:31:41.860 --> 01:31:42.700
Ros go for right now.

01:31:42.700 --> 01:31:44.900
But hopefully she'll give us a call back a little later

01:31:44.900 --> 01:31:45.940
in the program.

01:31:45.940 --> 01:31:47.660
Let's try to go to this call.

01:31:47.660 --> 01:31:50.020
Remember, guys, Echo 123, unfortunately, lag.

01:31:50.020 --> 01:31:51.980
There's not a whole lot we can do about.

01:31:51.980 --> 01:31:53.400
but we'll give it a try.

01:31:53.400 --> 01:31:55.440
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:31:55.440 --> 01:31:56.200
Oh, hi.

01:31:56.200 --> 01:31:57.640
Hi.

01:31:57.640 --> 01:31:58.680
Hold on, I'm getting an echo,

01:31:58.680 --> 01:32:00.720
because I'm still listening to your show.

01:32:00.720 --> 01:32:01.680
That's all right.

01:32:01.680 --> 01:32:02.840
Luckily we don't hear it,

01:32:02.840 --> 01:32:05.140
and I'm very happy that we're picking up a call

01:32:05.140 --> 01:32:07.600
that's unlagged and we can hear the person just fine.

01:32:07.600 --> 01:32:08.440
It's all good.

01:32:08.440 --> 01:32:10.100
So go ahead and turn that down,

01:32:10.100 --> 01:32:11.360
and what's on your mind?

01:32:15.680 --> 01:32:17.200
Actually, I don't really know.

01:32:17.200 --> 01:32:18.440
Okay, well who's this?

01:32:18.440 --> 01:32:19.440
Introduce yourself.

01:32:19.440 --> 01:32:23.080
Um, this is, uh, Xander from Florida.

01:32:23.080 --> 01:32:24.080
Hi, Xander.

01:32:24.080 --> 01:32:25.080
So there's...

01:32:25.080 --> 01:32:26.080
Yeah.

01:32:26.080 --> 01:32:27.080
Hi, Xander from Florida.

01:32:27.080 --> 01:32:28.080
So there's, like...

01:32:28.080 --> 01:32:29.080
Yeah.

01:32:29.080 --> 01:32:30.080
There's a massive, uh, time difference.

01:32:30.080 --> 01:32:31.080
So it's, like, 11 o'clock here.

01:32:31.080 --> 01:32:32.080
And I'm staying up way past my bedtime.

01:32:32.080 --> 01:32:33.080
I...

01:32:33.080 --> 01:32:34.080
I know.

01:32:34.080 --> 01:32:35.080
We...

01:32:35.080 --> 01:32:37.080
We really kind of screw over our East Coast fans with the timing of the show.

01:32:37.080 --> 01:32:42.040
But the problem is, is that, you know, we're all people that work during the week, Monday

01:32:42.040 --> 01:32:43.040
through Friday.

01:32:43.040 --> 01:32:45.920
So Saturday and Sunday are kind of, like, our days off.

01:32:45.920 --> 01:32:50.280
So if we were to do our show at like 4.30 or a time, it would cater more to the East

01:32:50.280 --> 01:32:51.280
Coast folks.

01:32:51.280 --> 01:32:54.920
We would pretty much be losing a day of our weekend, so that's unfortunately why we have

01:32:54.920 --> 01:32:58.200
to do it early, so, or, I mean, later on.

01:32:58.200 --> 01:33:00.320
And we are paid well enough to start early.

01:33:00.320 --> 01:33:02.320
We don't get paid for this crap, either, so.

01:33:02.320 --> 01:33:06.920
But of course, that's another reason why we do the podcast, is so that folks can download

01:33:06.920 --> 01:33:07.920
that whenever they want.

01:33:07.920 --> 01:33:08.920
I like the podcast.

01:33:08.920 --> 01:33:11.360
So I'm assuming you heard about the show through the podcast?

01:33:11.360 --> 01:33:14.680
No, actually, I heard about it through DDR Freak.

01:33:14.680 --> 01:33:15.680
Oh, right on.

01:33:15.680 --> 01:33:19.480
Yeah, we got a lot of folks from DDR Freak, because, you know, people horror, I, I, I

01:33:19.480 --> 01:33:21.480
I haven't warned you for anything yet, have I?

01:33:22.680 --> 01:33:25.480
No, actually, I don't, I'm not on the forums, I just, you know.

01:33:25.480 --> 01:33:25.980
Okay.

01:33:25.980 --> 01:33:26.480
Who's a lurker?

01:33:26.480 --> 01:33:27.780
I will, because I will if you want me to.

01:33:27.780 --> 01:33:30.480
He's a lurker, he's a lawyer, he just watches.

01:33:30.480 --> 01:33:31.280
That's awesome.

01:33:31.280 --> 01:33:32.480
I'm a lurker on a lot of stuff.

01:33:32.480 --> 01:33:33.480
That's good, alright.

01:33:33.480 --> 01:33:34.980
Yay, we have a stalker!

01:33:34.980 --> 01:33:39.480
Look, uh, I wanted to talk to Jamie about it in the group.

01:33:39.480 --> 01:33:40.080
Okay.

01:33:40.080 --> 01:33:42.080
Uh oh, uh oh, I'm in trouble.

01:33:42.080 --> 01:33:43.080
Alright, what's up?

01:33:43.080 --> 01:33:50.120
Okay, I'm a big fan of In the Groove, and I would say that you are massively wrong in

01:33:50.120 --> 01:33:53.720
saying that it is a rip-off, and it's extremely-

01:33:53.720 --> 01:33:54.720
Wait, wait, wait.

01:33:54.720 --> 01:33:55.720
I'm finished.

01:33:55.720 --> 01:33:56.720
I'm finished.

01:33:56.720 --> 01:33:57.720
Yes?

01:33:57.720 --> 01:33:58.720
Go ahead.

01:33:58.720 --> 01:34:00.600
Yeah, I find it much more fun than DDR.

01:34:00.600 --> 01:34:01.600
How is it not a rip-off?

01:34:01.600 --> 01:34:06.600
Well- I don't want examples, item by item.

01:34:06.600 --> 01:34:07.600
Hold on.

01:34:07.600 --> 01:34:08.600
Let's imagine it's just-

01:34:08.600 --> 01:34:09.600
It's so much fun.

01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:12.600
It's triplicate.

01:34:12.600 --> 01:34:15.240
What is more fun, let me see if I can phrase it,

01:34:15.240 --> 01:34:19.640
what is more fun for you for In the Groove as opposed to DDR?

01:34:19.640 --> 01:34:24.920
Well, once I got to about the 9-footers in DDR,

01:34:24.920 --> 01:34:29.160
it got kind of boring for me, because it just kind of stagnated at that point.

01:34:29.160 --> 01:34:32.240
And then the 10s, there's too much of a gap between the 9s and the 10s,

01:34:32.240 --> 01:34:35.440
so it's too hard to get into the max and stuff.

01:34:35.440 --> 01:34:39.920
So I find with In the Groove, you have much harder 9s on expert,

01:34:39.920 --> 01:34:42.200
and easier 10s, so the gap is kind of close.

01:34:42.200 --> 01:34:46.920
and I can have a lot more fun in between, which is basically where I am, so.

01:34:46.920 --> 01:34:51.040
Just out of curiosity, do you play on controller or play on actual dance pad?

01:34:51.040 --> 01:34:56.680
No, I play on the dance mat. What dance mat are you using?

01:34:56.680 --> 01:35:02.680
The red octane, the foam mat. Okay, my Ignition 3.0.

01:35:02.680 --> 01:35:05.160
Ignition 3.0. No, 2.0.

01:35:05.160 --> 01:35:10.000
Oh, 2.0. Okay, so for you, the thing that makes In the Groove a little more exciting

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:16.480
than DDR is the fact that there's more middle-ground, like, nine-and-a-half level

01:35:16.480 --> 01:35:17.480
step patterns.

01:35:17.480 --> 01:35:20.400
That some of the step patterns cater more to an advanced level.

01:35:20.400 --> 01:35:21.400
Right.

01:35:21.400 --> 01:35:22.400
And Charlene's awesome.

01:35:22.400 --> 01:35:24.600
That's never been my point.

01:35:24.600 --> 01:35:29.200
My point is that it took something and basically stole the idea.

01:35:29.200 --> 01:35:33.960
I'm very much one for innovation, and there is, like, no innovation.

01:35:33.960 --> 01:35:34.960
They basically took DDR.

01:35:34.960 --> 01:35:39.440
Well, they've got the hands and the minds, and they're willing to do much harder songs

01:35:39.440 --> 01:35:41.880
than Konami was ever willing to do with DDR, so...

01:35:41.880 --> 01:35:48.560
But the fact remains that you take a game using four arrows that you have to step on

01:35:48.560 --> 01:35:49.560
in pattern.

01:35:49.560 --> 01:35:55.520
Well, I'm gonna say the same thing about Dragon Warrior and Final Fantasy.

01:35:55.520 --> 01:35:58.160
I mean, they're the same style of game, but that doesn't mean they're a rip-off of each

01:35:58.160 --> 01:35:59.160
other.

01:35:59.160 --> 01:36:06.960
The systems are complete, we're actually, you can't compare RPGs that come out at the

01:36:06.960 --> 01:36:07.960
same time.

01:36:07.960 --> 01:36:12.560
comparing Grundio with Final Fantasy, though they have two different combat systems.

01:36:12.560 --> 01:36:17.360
I've heard a similar argument to this before, and it's saying that you don't say Mario and

01:36:17.360 --> 01:36:23.440
Sonic is the common one I heard, but for me, honestly, Mario and Sonic is not the accurate

01:36:23.440 --> 01:36:27.080
comparison when it comes to In the Groove and DDR4 Me, it's Mario and this old Commodore

01:36:27.080 --> 01:36:32.120
64 game called The Great Giana Sisters, which was an awful lot like Mario Bros., except

01:36:32.120 --> 01:36:36.200
it had a couple, it was girls, and there was a couple extra things in it, but...

01:36:36.200 --> 01:36:40.320
That's why I can hear Sonic and Jazz Jackrabbit, okay?

01:36:40.320 --> 01:36:44.880
But the whole fact of the matter remains, and this is why, to this day, I will be against

01:36:44.880 --> 01:36:51.360
In the Groove, was the fact that they were saying, hey, take DDR machines and modify

01:36:51.360 --> 01:36:52.360
them.

01:36:52.360 --> 01:36:53.360
You know, let's break...

01:36:53.360 --> 01:36:56.480
That's why they have the dedicated cabinets now, for In the Groove 2.

01:36:56.480 --> 01:37:02.960
Right, they have that now, but the whole fact remains that the origin of In the Groove was

01:37:02.960 --> 01:37:05.320
a rip-off and modification of DDR.

01:37:05.320 --> 01:37:09.720
What about StepMania? StepMania was never marketed for sale.

01:37:09.720 --> 01:37:13.720
Well, the In the Groove is kind of StepMania marketed for sale in a way.

01:37:13.720 --> 01:37:17.600
You could argue that. Exactly. Had StepMania been released as an item

01:37:17.600 --> 01:37:22.000
for sale, which is why I was against those kits that they were selling on eBay, the same

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:27.460
thing. It is a rip-off. It is stealing proprietary information from

01:37:27.460 --> 01:37:29.240
Kami. All right.

01:37:29.240 --> 01:37:33.960
That is where my point is. And to this day, I will consider In the Groove

01:37:33.960 --> 01:37:38.400
a cheap knock-off because they will not admit their fault.

01:37:38.400 --> 01:37:41.760
Despite the fact, now to play devil's advocate here with our caller a little bit, despite

01:37:41.760 --> 01:37:47.500
the fact that In the Groove might have some, you know, more challenging steps in songs

01:37:47.500 --> 01:37:49.520
that appeal to a different audience.

01:37:49.520 --> 01:37:53.800
I will give it that it's got interesting steps, although the earlier level steps are actually

01:37:53.800 --> 01:37:54.800
complete crap.

01:37:54.800 --> 01:37:56.800
I do like some of the music better.

01:37:56.800 --> 01:37:57.800
Okay.

01:37:57.800 --> 01:38:01.880
The only reason that I didn't play anything harder on In the Groove when I played it is

01:38:01.880 --> 01:38:06.800
I was fresh off of a car accident. You know, I was having this issue with my hip wanting

01:38:06.800 --> 01:38:11.360
to dislocate itself every time I stepped funny. But, um, so I didn't get the chance to try

01:38:11.360 --> 01:38:15.560
anything harder. I'm not saying it's not a fun game. I'm not saying it doesn't offer

01:38:15.560 --> 01:38:19.800
challenge. My whole point comes with the origin of the game, and that's why I'm against it.

01:38:19.800 --> 01:38:22.640
Okay. This is not an easy topic. We've been here before.

01:38:22.640 --> 01:38:27.520
I don't believe in thievery in the industry. What, Loki? I'm sure you're just dying over

01:38:27.520 --> 01:38:30.600
there, Loki. I'm not dying at anything. No, honestly, I

01:38:30.600 --> 01:38:34.600
I don't like the game. I don't expect everyone to agree with me. I'm not trying to like the game.

01:38:34.600 --> 01:38:41.600
What I don't like about the game? First off, the interface is extremely plain. It just, it looks like whoever made the skin, like, crapped it out in about five minutes.

01:38:41.600 --> 01:38:46.600
The songs are all very generic. They sound very alike, and it's just really generic sounding stuff.

01:38:46.600 --> 01:38:54.600
The step patterns suck. I don't like them. I don't like the fact that there are hands and feet, or whatever, you know, the hands part of it, because it's retarded.

01:38:54.600 --> 01:39:02.440
I was kind of against the whole involvement of the iToy for DDR.

01:39:02.440 --> 01:39:06.160
I'm talking about the three steps at once or the four steps at once.

01:39:06.160 --> 01:39:07.160
It's retarded.

01:39:07.160 --> 01:39:08.160
It's just like Pump It Up.

01:39:08.160 --> 01:39:10.160
Yeah, and I hate it in Pump It Up.

01:39:10.160 --> 01:39:12.280
I hate Pump It Up the way they have that.

01:39:12.280 --> 01:39:16.640
Although, I like, you know what, I really, really like that recent pump release for Home

01:39:16.640 --> 01:39:19.080
because it is an awesome dance game, it really is.

01:39:19.080 --> 01:39:23.200
But still, some of the steps in Pump It Up are just as benign as

01:39:23.200 --> 01:39:27.200
I think all I said was it didn't look like they put that much polish in it. That's it.

01:39:27.200 --> 01:39:32.200
And in the group too, I'm sorry, they didn't put that much polish in that one either. They just changed the interface.

01:39:32.200 --> 01:39:41.200
Yeah, I could have also made a better cover with an afternoon in Illustrator with my, like, all of this, you know, five week skill in Illustrator than they did.

01:39:41.200 --> 01:39:46.200
To each their own. I mean, I don't care if you play the game. I think it's cool if you're supporting another company.

01:39:46.200 --> 01:39:51.040
know what there needs to be more dancing games out there and just maybe deviate a

01:39:51.040 --> 01:39:55.040
little bit more from DVR than you did before I mean I know what will make

01:39:55.040 --> 01:40:00.200
everybody happy we have DVR food mix for they just hire the food mix people and

01:40:00.200 --> 01:40:04.000
say make us a DVR and make some market that and then everyone will be happy. But it

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:08.320
still be a ripoff? I said Konami needs to. Oh Konami. It's a ripoff within the same

01:40:08.320 --> 01:40:14.160
company though that's kind of her point. Alright I get it. But if Konami releases it it's not a ripoff because it's Konami.

01:40:14.160 --> 01:40:17.600
I miss the Konami doing it part. Because it's Konami's intellectual property.

01:40:17.600 --> 01:40:22.840
All right, this discussion's been going on an awful long time, and honestly...

01:40:22.840 --> 01:40:28.440
All I want is for the In the Groove fans to admit that it's a rip-off.

01:40:28.440 --> 01:40:32.960
It's been going on for about ever since the damn game came out, so there's no easy answer,

01:40:32.960 --> 01:40:37.480
but we're just going to have to agree to disagree on this one with In the Groove.

01:40:37.480 --> 01:40:40.880
But thank you for your call and letting us know your side of it, okay?

01:40:40.880 --> 01:40:42.880
Okay. All right, have a good one, buddy.

01:40:42.880 --> 01:40:45.680
I completely respect your opinion, by the way.

01:40:45.680 --> 01:40:50.820
Alright, yeah, that's good. Even if I disagree. Alright, later dude.

01:40:50.820 --> 01:40:55.360
Alright, very interesting. I'm just like, you know, I just don't care. I don't.

01:40:55.360 --> 01:41:00.400
But honestly though, it's the same... I'm not even adamant about, like, pointing out that it's a rip-off. Who cares?

01:41:00.400 --> 01:41:05.880
Who cares? That's actually all I care about is people admitting that they basically stole.

01:41:05.880 --> 01:41:09.040
Well, it should all come out in the courts pretty, well, not pretty soon, but...

01:41:09.040 --> 01:41:12.040
Yeah, as soon as Rockstar gets the Smackdown laid off, I'm sure.

01:41:12.040 --> 01:41:15.040
We'll see. Alright, new topic, new title. Let's see if our next caller...

01:41:15.040 --> 01:41:17.040
I'm gonna try this guy one more time here.

01:41:17.040 --> 01:41:18.040
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:41:18.040 --> 01:41:19.040
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:41:19.040 --> 01:41:21.040
Hey, listen to this insane...

01:41:21.040 --> 01:41:23.040
I'm not even adamant about, like, pointing out...

01:41:23.040 --> 01:41:24.040
feedback.

01:41:24.040 --> 01:41:27.040
We got really bad feedback there. Turn down your, uh, speakers.

01:41:27.040 --> 01:41:28.040
It's... it's...

01:41:28.040 --> 01:41:29.040
Hello?

01:41:29.040 --> 01:41:30.040
Hello? Yeah.

01:41:30.040 --> 01:41:32.040
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:41:32.040 --> 01:41:35.040
Yeah, you guys are really choppy.

01:41:35.040 --> 01:41:37.040
It happens. Skype is really weird.

01:41:37.040 --> 01:41:38.040
It's really weird.

01:41:38.040 --> 01:41:44.040
Alright, um, yeah, hey, first time caller, um...

01:41:44.040 --> 01:41:47.040
What's on your mind, my friend?

01:41:47.040 --> 01:41:52.040
Alright, um, main reason I called in, um...

01:41:52.040 --> 01:41:59.040
Assuming that I don't win an Xbox 360 from the, uh, whole Mountain Dew, Pepsi, uh...

01:41:59.040 --> 01:42:06.040
Win an Xbox 360 every 10 minutes thing, uh, that I didn't religiously collect the coin for,

01:42:06.040 --> 01:42:12.040
Um, should I sell my PSP to help fund an Xbox 360 in your opinion?

01:42:12.040 --> 01:42:14.040
We'll sell your PSP to get a...

01:42:14.040 --> 01:42:16.040
Actually, I'm going to say the caller real quick.

01:42:16.040 --> 01:42:20.040
We're going to have to hang up on you because of the feedback, but keep listening.

01:42:20.040 --> 01:42:23.040
Alright, so keep listening, because we're going to get to this guy's call here,

01:42:23.040 --> 01:42:26.040
and we're just getting really bad feedback on that call, but we want to answer the question.

01:42:26.040 --> 01:42:33.040
So the question was, assuming that I cannot win an Xbox 360 through the every ten minutes competition that's going on,

01:42:33.040 --> 01:42:39.040
on, which, you're not going to win one. Well, if you do win one, hats off to you, but everybody

01:42:39.040 --> 01:42:44.080
and their mom, every nerd drinks Mountain Dew, unless they're on a diet, like, you have

01:42:44.080 --> 01:42:45.080
a better chance...

01:42:45.080 --> 01:42:47.600
I'm a nerd, and I don't drink Mountain Dew because I think it tastes like pee.

01:42:47.600 --> 01:42:51.240
You have a better chance of getting a 360 doing one of those referral programs than

01:42:51.240 --> 01:42:52.240
you would doing the...

01:42:52.240 --> 01:42:55.800
You have a better chance of getting a 360 by saving up the money and buying one.

01:42:55.800 --> 01:43:00.080
Not to knock it, though, dude. If you're going to try that way, have fun with it, and Mountain

01:43:00.080 --> 01:43:05.080
Mountain Dew. I like Mountain Dew, but it's too many calories for me. How dumb do I sound?

01:43:05.080 --> 01:43:10.080
But back to the subject, the thing is should he sell his PSP to get an Xbox 360? I think

01:43:10.080 --> 01:43:14.080
that you should sell your PSP to get a Turbo Express, because Better Games came out on

01:43:14.080 --> 01:43:15.080
the Turbo Dew.

01:43:15.080 --> 01:43:16.080
Oh, please.

01:43:16.080 --> 01:43:17.080
Ah, blah, blah, blah.

01:43:17.080 --> 01:43:19.080
You know what they need to bring back? They need to bring back my Liveware, because I

01:43:19.080 --> 01:43:22.080
love that drink, and I don't want to drink Shasta.

01:43:22.080 --> 01:43:25.080
Okay, let me try to give the caller, the person who called in there, who was, by the way,

01:43:25.080 --> 01:43:30.040
I'm trying to remember the name here, it was Keith?

01:43:30.040 --> 01:43:33.840
Keith from Chicago, I think was the guy that just called us there.

01:43:33.840 --> 01:43:37.120
Should I sell a PSP to get an Xbox 360?

01:43:37.120 --> 01:43:38.880
Here's the golden rule of gaming.

01:43:38.880 --> 01:43:42.080
We've said this, if you're gonna judge a system time and time again,

01:43:42.080 --> 01:43:45.960
a system is only as good as the games that they put out on it.

01:43:45.960 --> 01:43:47.000
I have always said that.

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.960
I know you have, and I'm repeating it, because it's the golden rule of gaming,

01:43:49.960 --> 01:43:51.800
and I say apply it here.

01:43:51.800 --> 01:43:54.520
Look at the games that are coming out for Xbox 360.

01:43:54.520 --> 01:43:55.840
Are you into racing games?

01:43:55.840 --> 01:43:57.240
Are you into sports games?

01:43:57.240 --> 01:43:58.920
Is guns something that interests you?

01:43:58.920 --> 01:44:01.280
Is Dead or Alive series something that interests you?

01:44:01.280 --> 01:44:06.040
If these are games that interest you, Xbox 360 is the way to go.

01:44:06.040 --> 01:44:10.000
If, on the other hand, you're more into the types of things that you can do on

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:13.080
the handheld and the things that are gonna be coming out for PSP.

01:44:13.080 --> 01:44:18.520
If you want the new Katamari PSP game, if you want Metal Gear Acid 2 and

01:44:18.520 --> 01:44:21.120
more the tactical games and more portable things, and

01:44:21.120 --> 01:44:27.860
like to watch movies on the go, then PSP is more for you. So, while we can kind of make

01:44:27.860 --> 01:44:34.860
a decision based on what our preference would be, honestly I couldn't decide. I would hold,

01:44:35.520 --> 01:44:41.320
honestly if this were me, if I were absolutely poor and I had no way to afford these games

01:44:41.320 --> 01:44:45.040
right now, I didn't have a job, I was unemployed so I had to cut back on my gaming regardless

01:44:45.040 --> 01:44:51.560
or not, I would probably hold on to my PSP for right now and stick it out a little bit

01:44:51.560 --> 01:44:56.740
longer because there's really nothing that's coming out for the 360 for me right now that's

01:44:56.740 --> 01:45:00.160
making me go, oh my gosh, I have to have this right now.

01:45:00.160 --> 01:45:04.200
And what if you get the 360 and then the PS3 comes out and you're like, oh crap, I wanted

01:45:04.200 --> 01:45:05.200
to get that instead.

01:45:05.200 --> 01:45:06.200
Exactly.

01:45:06.200 --> 01:45:09.680
You know, I would wait until, you know, this stuff comes out, I mean honestly it doesn't

01:45:09.680 --> 01:45:14.440
look like there's that much stuff coming out at launch, and just stick with the PSP for

01:45:14.440 --> 01:45:18.500
now. Especially if you're going to invest in a 360, you're going to be investing quite

01:45:18.500 --> 01:45:19.960
a bit of money. You know what, that's a really good idea.

01:45:19.960 --> 01:45:24.440
See if there's a, when the Xbox 360 comes out and you can play this at GameStop, EB

01:45:24.440 --> 01:45:27.320
Games, your favorite retailer, play the demos, maybe you can make a better decision at that

01:45:27.320 --> 01:45:33.120
point. There's no reason you have to get a 360 the day it comes out unless there's just

01:45:33.120 --> 01:45:36.360
this game you're dying for. Also, I personally do not advocate trading

01:45:36.360 --> 01:45:42.160
in your systems or games unless the game is crap. For the simple reason, I often find

01:45:42.160 --> 01:45:48.020
moments were like, oh, I want to play this game, and I'll go bust out the Neo Geo and

01:45:48.020 --> 01:45:49.980
we can play King of Fighters 2000.

01:45:49.980 --> 01:45:54.060
How many people do we know that has sold back a system and then had to buy it again later?

01:45:54.060 --> 01:45:57.180
I know many, many folks.

01:45:57.180 --> 01:45:58.180
I've done it myself.

01:45:58.180 --> 01:46:03.100
And we ourselves, we have, the only system that we have actually ever gotten rid of was

01:46:03.100 --> 01:46:07.460
our Nintendo 64, and we are borrowing somebody else's.

01:46:07.460 --> 01:46:10.060
So I mean, it doesn't really matter.

01:46:10.060 --> 01:46:14.260
You know, there's been days when we've broken out the Cliccovision and freaking had a growth

01:46:14.260 --> 01:46:15.260
fest.

01:46:15.260 --> 01:46:16.260
Right.

01:46:16.260 --> 01:46:17.260
Or played Venture.

01:46:17.260 --> 01:46:18.260
Sure.

01:46:18.260 --> 01:46:23.200
You know, next, only to put it up, you know, an hour later and break out the, the Turbo

01:46:23.200 --> 01:46:24.740
Graphics and play a bunch of Bonk.

01:46:24.740 --> 01:46:26.220
So I think that's another good element to look at.

01:46:26.220 --> 01:46:30.180
If you're going to sell that PSP back, think to yourself, am I going to regret this later?

01:46:30.180 --> 01:46:34.660
Is there going to be a game coming out for PSP that I'm going to really, really want

01:46:34.660 --> 01:46:35.660
later?

01:46:35.660 --> 01:46:39.100
Like, what, what the hell else is coming out on PSP and the, the Loki, what, what are some

01:46:39.100 --> 01:46:44.660
of the big games that somebody might really be like Grand Theft Auto Liberty

01:46:44.660 --> 01:46:49.300
stories has a good one the gauntlet has been thrown in the chatroom oh what

01:46:49.300 --> 01:46:54.540
happened tons of I have to label off my systems now okay all right anyway um

01:46:54.540 --> 01:46:57.500
before you sell back your PSP make sure it's something you're not going to

01:46:57.500 --> 01:47:01.260
regret later on with the games so that's all really really long-winded answer to

01:47:01.260 --> 01:47:04.300
your question I hope you I hope you're able to still listen and sorry we had to

01:47:04.300 --> 01:47:06.700
let you go there but we were just getting too much feedback and I think

01:47:06.700 --> 01:47:11.860
is being retarded. Skype is being very bad tonight. I'm punishing Skype. I'm not punishing

01:47:11.860 --> 01:47:15.860
our listeners, but I'm punishing Skype, and we're going to sign into Do Not Disturb for

01:47:15.860 --> 01:47:23.180
a little while. That was the last Skype word. Huh? All right. So again, if you want to give

01:47:23.180 --> 01:47:26.780
us feedback, you can always send us an email. You can always join our chat room, and we

01:47:26.780 --> 01:47:31.300
always try to get to this stuff on the show. www.orangeontrade.com, click on Chat. I'd

01:47:31.300 --> 01:47:35.740
really like to hear from this guy, what he thought of our feedback there, and of course

01:47:35.740 --> 01:47:40.760
our forums. I know I've been searching those forums non-stop lately on orangeontradar.com

01:47:40.760 --> 01:47:44.680
and there's been some pretty neat posts and some good questions asked. And I, you know,

01:47:44.680 --> 01:47:49.800
if I'm bored, I always take time to state my opinion there on the forums. So check that

01:47:49.800 --> 01:47:56.200
out as well on orangeontradar.com. All right. And some folks in the chat room are crying

01:47:56.200 --> 01:47:59.080
because they didn't get through on Skype line. So we're really sorry, but we are punishing

01:47:59.080 --> 01:48:01.920
Skype for a little while. If we have some extra time at the end of the show, we'll come

01:48:01.920 --> 01:48:05.540
back to skype okay we promise but for now we're long overdue for a break you

01:48:05.540 --> 01:48:09.580
guys so we're going to go to a break and in this break I think we're gonna play

01:48:09.580 --> 01:48:16.220
something from oh I don't know how about how about an out phase song from bmania

01:48:16.220 --> 01:48:20.460
2dx I've heard this a long time so we'll be back with more orange launch radio

01:48:20.460 --> 01:48:22.460
After this, you guys, stay tuned.

01:49:50.460 --> 01:50:04.960
🎵

01:50:04.960 --> 01:50:09.960
🎵 Charlie, he's a gangly little sister of mine 🎵

Stay out Charlene

01:50:22.460 --> 01:50:24.460
Just beware of the dark side of town

01:50:25.460 --> 01:50:28.460
There's no passion inside to tear you down

01:50:29.460 --> 01:50:31.460
Wherever people are feeling deep

01:50:32.460 --> 01:50:35.460
Better stay out Charlene

01:51:05.460 --> 01:51:11.460
I saw you last night in your fancy outfit

01:51:11.460 --> 01:51:15.460
I'm the man in the dark streets

01:51:15.460 --> 01:51:18.460
That touched your gorgeous body

01:51:18.460 --> 01:51:20.460
Let me be I

01:51:20.460 --> 01:51:23.460
So please take care of yourself

01:51:23.460 --> 01:51:27.460
Don't give away everything you own

01:51:27.460 --> 01:51:30.460
No one will give you back

01:51:30.460 --> 01:51:33.460
You understand that you have fun

01:51:33.460 --> 01:51:38.460
Charlene, you're such a little sister of mine

01:51:38.460 --> 01:51:42.460
Better stay off your drugs and the wine

01:51:42.460 --> 01:51:45.460
Don't get lost in the danger we see

01:51:45.460 --> 01:51:47.460
With you so, Charlene

01:51:47.460 --> 01:51:50.460
Stay out, Charlene

01:51:50.460 --> 01:51:54.460
Just beware of the dark side of town

01:51:54.460 --> 01:51:57.460
There's no passion except to turn you down

01:51:57.460 --> 01:52:00.460
We're the people who are bleeding in need

01:52:00.460 --> 01:52:04.460
You better stay up and join me

01:52:04.460 --> 01:52:06.460
Please don't touch my mane.

01:54:34.460 --> 01:55:01.900
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12

01:55:01.900 --> 01:55:06.900
My soul has come to life, it's just too much I need you

01:55:06.900 --> 01:55:11.900
I need you

01:55:41.900 --> 01:56:06.580
Hello, we're back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:56:06.580 --> 01:56:11.140
In that break you heard a little bit of Summer Vacation there from 2DX6 style.

01:56:11.140 --> 01:56:15.380
Charlene from In the Groove, because a big part of that last segment we were talking

01:56:15.380 --> 01:56:19.540
to an In the Groove fan who wanted to discuss with Jamie the pros and cons there, and they

01:56:19.540 --> 01:56:22.480
said they liked Charlene and a lot of our chat room likes that song too, so we thought

01:56:22.480 --> 01:56:26.260
we'd nod those folks with that.

01:56:26.260 --> 01:56:30.580
Also V, as requested by our chat room about a gazillion times there, so there you go,

01:56:30.580 --> 01:56:38.620
some V, the perennially hoarded Bamani song on all mixes that that song's ever been in.

01:56:38.620 --> 01:56:43.000
And then Ghosts, which I think a lot of you folks forgot about, but that song was an awesome

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:47.080
song that was in DDR Max and in America Max 2.

01:56:47.080 --> 01:56:49.840
So there you have it in that break.

01:56:49.840 --> 01:56:50.840
Moving on, what's going on?

01:56:50.840 --> 01:56:54.880
Of course we're very little on the music gaming news this week, so we've been kind of scouring

01:56:54.880 --> 01:56:58.360
some other sites, seeing what's kind of going on out there in the world, because you know,

01:56:58.360 --> 01:57:01.700
we can talk about non-gaming things once in a while, yes?

01:57:01.700 --> 01:57:05.400
So one thing I was reading, I thought this was very interesting, this article got slash

01:57:05.400 --> 01:57:06.400
dotted.

01:57:06.400 --> 01:57:13.560
that was posted over on this website, gaminghorizon.com, and it's this article talking about, here's

01:57:13.560 --> 01:57:18.720
all the shit we're sick of at E3. And of course, now, three of the four of us sitting in the

01:57:18.720 --> 01:57:20.840
room right now have been to E3 before. Sorry, bugs.

01:57:20.840 --> 01:57:23.200
I plan on going this year. Are you going to go this year?

01:57:23.200 --> 01:57:25.800
Rad? Well, bug? Get bug to Mike. Look.

01:57:25.800 --> 01:57:29.760
Give me the damn mic. Yes, I do plan on going this year. My roommate

01:57:29.760 --> 01:57:32.000
has gone for the past four years. Oh, right on.

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:36.200
And he just manages to walk right on in. See, you're going to act like you're going

01:57:36.200 --> 01:57:38.420
an ad to the overcrowding, basically, of E3.

01:57:38.420 --> 01:57:39.420
Yes.

01:57:39.420 --> 01:57:40.420
All right, sounds good.

01:57:40.420 --> 01:57:41.420
But I can show people aside.

01:57:41.420 --> 01:57:44.640
What's interesting about this article is it really kind of points out things that are

01:57:44.640 --> 01:57:49.420
wrong with E3, so I'm kind of curious, you know, for you guys, because E3's not that

01:57:49.420 --> 01:57:50.420
far away now.

01:57:50.420 --> 01:57:54.200
I mean, we've got to start thinking now in, you know, January we're going to be going

01:57:54.200 --> 01:57:57.820
and signing up for E3 again, so all that fun stuff.

01:57:57.820 --> 01:58:03.160
The biggest problems they say E3 has, the swagbagger, somebody who goes to the show

01:58:03.160 --> 01:58:06.480
show, just to get the free stuff and sell it on eBay.

01:58:06.480 --> 01:58:10.520
I went for swag my first year. To keep, though. That's different. When you

01:58:10.520 --> 01:58:12.560
keep it for yourself, that's different. And to give away to friends.

01:58:12.560 --> 01:58:16.880
Right. And we've done the giveaways, you know, on the show, too, so. But going to sell is

01:58:16.880 --> 01:58:20.320
not cool. But last year, it was all like, okay, I can't

01:58:20.320 --> 01:58:28.120
carry this crap around. And my goal, my first goal the first year I went was actually for

01:58:28.120 --> 01:58:32.800
media kits. My second year was media kits and getting into media events, which I succeeded

01:58:32.800 --> 01:58:42.080
in? Overpopulation, of course. My god, E3 was so crowded this year, it's not even funny,

01:58:42.080 --> 01:58:52.640
which of course ties back into the food lines, are god-awful at E3. I think next year somebody

01:58:52.640 --> 01:58:57.400
would be really smart to open up a hot dog stand out front. Like 50 of them. Or not just

01:58:57.400 --> 01:59:02.000
hot dog stands, but... Permits! How about a salad... They were chasing off folks with

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:05.780
the hot dog stands because they didn't have permits for sale. That is such BS. Actually

01:59:05.780 --> 01:59:09.820
it's law. Well, I understand it's the law, but come on, you've got all those people packed

01:59:09.820 --> 01:59:13.500
in that tiny building and they're trying to eat for God's sake, and to make them pay ten

01:59:13.500 --> 01:59:19.760
dollars for a hamburger is insane. So, shame on them. Or at least somebody go get a permit

01:59:19.760 --> 01:59:24.060
then and make it legal. Or how about, instead of like hot dog carts, how about a salad cart

01:59:24.060 --> 01:59:27.140
or something healthy for these people, which includes me.

01:59:27.140 --> 01:59:27.940
The fruit cart.

01:59:27.940 --> 01:59:28.580
The fruit cart.

01:59:28.580 --> 01:59:29.660
How about some hot fruit?

01:59:32.260 --> 01:59:33.940
I can't be the only hot fruit at E3.

01:59:33.940 --> 01:59:35.980
Come on.

01:59:35.980 --> 01:59:39.220
Media, media, media, everything is all media-centric,

01:59:39.220 --> 01:59:41.220
which some argue is the way it needs to be.

01:59:41.220 --> 01:59:42.820
Some argue, say, company.

01:59:42.820 --> 01:59:45.100
Of course, the rock star booth this year was shit,

01:59:45.100 --> 01:59:46.420
unless you were in the media.

01:59:46.420 --> 01:59:48.060
You couldn't do anything at that booth,

01:59:48.060 --> 01:59:49.420
unless you were media-oriented.

01:59:49.420 --> 01:59:51.140
Some people say that one day of E3

01:59:51.140 --> 01:59:53.420
needs to be nothing but media.

01:59:53.420 --> 01:59:56.500
be very interesting

01:59:56.500 --> 01:59:59.400
sexploitation of E3

01:59:59.400 --> 02:00:03.100
the fact that it's booth babes, booth babes, booth babes, and then just random

02:00:03.100 --> 02:00:05.260
uh... girls walking around

02:00:05.260 --> 02:00:08.820
nope, very very few booth boys

02:00:08.820 --> 02:00:11.900
very few. Just as barbarians it was great

02:00:11.900 --> 02:00:15.740
well let's face it though, the statistics are that you know

02:00:15.740 --> 02:00:18.100
most of the E3, the bacon dogs were awesome

02:00:18.100 --> 02:00:20.740
most of the E3, that was a random comment

02:00:20.740 --> 02:00:26.900
Most of the E3 is very male-dominated, but at the same time, I see a lot more women.

02:00:26.900 --> 02:00:31.380
There's more women that go to that show than you'd think, you know, so I'm kind of surprised

02:00:31.380 --> 02:00:34.700
they don't have more booth dudes or, you know, whatever you want to call them, booth hunks.

02:00:34.700 --> 02:00:35.700
I don't see anything wrong with that.

02:00:35.700 --> 02:00:36.700
I couldn't interview by IGN.

02:00:36.700 --> 02:00:37.700
What?

02:00:37.700 --> 02:00:38.700
I couldn't interview by IGN.

02:00:38.700 --> 02:00:39.700
As, like, a gamer girl, right?

02:00:39.700 --> 02:00:40.700
As a gamer girl.

02:00:40.700 --> 02:00:41.700
Yeah.

02:00:41.700 --> 02:00:42.700
I was like, do you consider yourself a gamer girl?

02:00:42.700 --> 02:00:43.700
No, I only host internet radio about video games.

02:00:43.700 --> 02:00:50.700
like, do you consider yourself a gamer girl? No, I only host internet radio about video

02:00:50.700 --> 02:00:57.540
games. I'm sorry, you're not a true gaming girl, you have not licked a PSV. Huh? You

02:00:57.540 --> 02:01:03.740
know, the licking the PSV? I am older school than old school. Oh, forget it. Um, people

02:01:03.740 --> 02:01:10.700
that camp and play the demos all day long. Well, I realize this, but I'm talking about

02:01:10.700 --> 02:01:15.700
like the one particular demo, like, what's a game that people were doing this on at this

02:01:15.700 --> 02:01:19.980
year's E3 that people would just not get off those damn demos no matter what? Not really

02:01:19.980 --> 02:01:24.040
so much Katamari, actually. The way the Katamari demo was set up, it was very hard to camp

02:01:24.040 --> 02:01:28.420
that demo. What was, I'm trying to think of a demo that was really badly camped. Soul

02:01:28.420 --> 02:01:34.580
Calibur III was pretty bad. So, I don't know. There's other ones, too. Well, in the year

02:01:34.580 --> 02:01:43.500
before that, even though I would say probably Contra, the Contra game, and oh, I don't remember

02:01:43.500 --> 02:01:46.820
the other one now.

02:01:46.820 --> 02:01:53.300
Cattle prods and timed electrical pulses will, although some people might get to like that.

02:01:53.300 --> 02:01:59.380
Shuttle delays, so it makes it very hard to get to the damn show, I agree with that one.

02:01:59.380 --> 02:02:04.180
The sound, the fact that the sound is very, very loud there.

02:02:04.180 --> 02:02:07.440
you ever been to any other type of conference? I got to touch the katamari and that made

02:02:07.440 --> 02:02:11.280
me happy. The fact that the lines are incredibly long

02:02:11.280 --> 02:02:18.280
and you never really necessarily know what they're for, in some cases, and sometimes

02:02:18.280 --> 02:02:23.320
the lines are to just walk through a room. The article says the line at Nintendo is for

02:02:23.320 --> 02:02:27.560
a screening at Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess. They'd just shown the trailer at the press

02:02:27.560 --> 02:02:32.040
conference the day before. And then the line at Sony was to walk through

02:02:32.040 --> 02:02:38.080
a room where they had hallow models of the PlayStation 3 design behind glass, two days

02:02:38.080 --> 02:02:40.880
before they'd released high-res images of the system anyway.

02:02:40.880 --> 02:02:42.800
Were you supposed to kneel down in reverence?

02:02:42.800 --> 02:02:43.800
Maybe.

02:02:43.800 --> 02:02:49.880
Hey, I'm not going to say anything because we had those pictures up as soon as we were

02:02:49.880 --> 02:02:50.880
back.

02:02:50.880 --> 02:02:54.080
Here's their suggestions, and then we'll wrap this up and get into other segments here because

02:02:54.080 --> 02:02:57.600
I know maybe some people are like, well, what the hell do I care?

02:02:57.600 --> 02:02:58.600
I don't get to go to E3.

02:02:58.600 --> 02:02:59.600
Huh?

02:02:59.600 --> 02:03:00.600
I know.

02:03:00.600 --> 02:03:01.600
We'll get to that.

02:03:01.600 --> 02:03:05.520
Um, suggestions on how to make E3 better.

02:03:05.520 --> 02:03:09.480
Tighten the entrance requirements.

02:03:09.480 --> 02:03:13.520
It's saying if you work at a Hollywood video store, um, you shouldn't be coming in.

02:03:13.520 --> 02:03:16.440
If you draw an online comic strip, you shouldn't be coming in.

02:03:16.440 --> 02:03:21.080
If you come to, if you're from blogger.com and you occasionally talk about games, you

02:03:21.080 --> 02:03:23.600
shouldn't be coming in.

02:03:23.600 --> 02:03:28.800
If you just really want to get into E3 because you want to play upcoming games, you're part

02:03:28.800 --> 02:03:31.520
of the problem, says this site.

02:03:31.520 --> 02:03:35.520
I'm not sure if that's the best way to phrase it.

02:03:35.520 --> 02:03:41.520
If you work at Target in the Garden Department, just because Target carries games, you shouldn't be going to E3.

02:03:41.520 --> 02:03:47.520
I think you have to play the upcoming games. You can tell other people about them. So, yes, that is part of the reason why you play.

02:03:47.520 --> 02:03:54.520
A media-only day. I don't know if that's the answer. I think the media gets too much favoritism as it is.

02:03:54.520 --> 02:03:57.520
If they would just tighten up who they let in in the general.

02:03:57.520 --> 02:04:02.800
Yeah, but the media, the hype that the media generates is part of what sells the games.

02:04:02.800 --> 02:04:04.840
I understand that, but I just...

02:04:04.840 --> 02:04:11.760
Part of what, you know, you've got to cater to the fan base, but it is a media event.

02:04:11.760 --> 02:04:12.760
It is an industry event.

02:04:12.760 --> 02:04:14.560
It's an industry event, not a media event.

02:04:14.560 --> 02:04:15.560
There's a difference.

02:04:15.560 --> 02:04:16.560
It's an industry event.

02:04:16.560 --> 02:04:17.560
But I do think the media should get different.

02:04:17.560 --> 02:04:22.960
They're the ones who are actually reporting on it, they should be getting the information

02:04:22.960 --> 02:04:24.720
before the average consumer.

02:04:24.720 --> 02:04:27.720
What about, like, a manager of a GameStop who's not the media?

02:04:27.720 --> 02:04:31.220
Then they need to be shown some credentials. I think that they should get into that too.

02:04:31.220 --> 02:04:37.720
But I was saying, the average, you know, GameStop employee, the average Target employee,

02:04:37.720 --> 02:04:43.220
the people who do a webcomic, you know, if you, I think if you report on it,

02:04:43.220 --> 02:04:49.720
or if you are in charge of a group that is selling it, then you should be allowed to.

02:04:49.720 --> 02:04:53.720
And maybe not even the managers as much. Maybe it should be, like, the district managers,

02:04:53.720 --> 02:04:55.800
marketing people for companies

02:04:55.800 --> 02:04:59.200
uh... less babes more games

02:04:59.200 --> 02:05:02.600
so i don't know about that one some some some guys might have a problem with that

02:05:02.600 --> 02:05:06.920
i like babes uh... streamline the press conferences

02:05:06.920 --> 02:05:09.920
uh... the one thing about the the press they were saying is no love for the

02:05:09.920 --> 02:05:12.040
small press like

02:05:12.040 --> 02:05:13.800
uh... because she for

02:05:13.800 --> 02:05:19.200
and i g n and gary like five thousand people doing a whore out everything and

02:05:19.200 --> 02:05:24.640
It's like, you know, Joe Bob, who actually has, you know, a website that's pretty popular,

02:05:24.640 --> 02:05:29.560
but not as popular as these, can't get into anything because they're being hoarded out.

02:05:29.560 --> 02:05:34.440
It's like, who are you? We don't know who you are, so fuck off, you know.

02:05:34.440 --> 02:05:39.000
And no behind closed doors only content. I have to agree with that one.

02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:42.560
I agree with that. That's a bunch of crap, keeping the stuff behind closed doors. Just

02:05:42.560 --> 02:05:45.560
don't show it at all.

02:05:45.560 --> 02:05:47.560
And some of this isn't even very special.

02:05:47.560 --> 02:05:50.120
Fix the demo camper problem.

02:05:50.120 --> 02:05:52.440
Just have those demos reset after like three minutes,

02:05:52.440 --> 02:05:53.280
or say, time's up.

02:05:53.280 --> 02:05:55.160
Get off my game.

02:05:55.160 --> 02:05:57.040
Watch the volume.

02:05:57.040 --> 02:06:00.520
Figure out what's secret and what's public.

02:06:00.520 --> 02:06:04.320
Have operational press sites running alongside the show.

02:06:04.320 --> 02:06:05.440
That's kind of interesting.

02:06:05.440 --> 02:06:07.760
And the last one, which I think is very interesting,

02:06:07.760 --> 02:06:10.640
have an East Coast show.

02:06:10.640 --> 02:06:11.840
No.

02:06:11.840 --> 02:06:19.960
Actually, I thought that Microsoft did their Xbox 360 demo very intelligently, got a ticket.

02:06:19.960 --> 02:06:23.000
You go up, get your ticket, you come back at the time for the ticket, and they let you

02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:24.000
in.

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:25.000
That's like Squeenix's thing.

02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:26.000
Squeenix's little joke.

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:27.000
Yeah, that was pretty smart, too.

02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:32.360
I mean, I think it was very, you know, although you do have to, you know, wait for your turn,

02:06:32.360 --> 02:06:34.800
but it prevents them from being the insane line.

02:06:34.800 --> 02:06:40.440
Okay, it did actually prevent the line at Squeenix, but it did prevent the lines for

02:06:40.440 --> 02:06:45.560
the 360, you had your line formed at the time it was to let them in.

02:06:45.560 --> 02:06:47.440
You get inside, no more line.

02:06:47.440 --> 02:06:49.360
You don't have to worry about the congestion of people.

02:06:49.360 --> 02:06:50.360
It was very smart.

02:06:50.360 --> 02:06:54.960
They should, you know, I even think that they should have, this is like what they do with

02:06:54.960 --> 02:07:00.900
Anime Expo, you know, if you're staying in the convention center hotels or the ones associated

02:07:00.900 --> 02:07:06.280
with the convention, then as part of, you know, you can go pick up a ticket when you

02:07:06.280 --> 02:07:09.180
prove that you're staying at one of these places or you know because that's

02:07:09.180 --> 02:07:13.240
that'll be no general a little bit more money for both the hotel and you know

02:07:13.240 --> 02:07:18.760
and for the convention itself but it also prevents you know there from being

02:07:18.760 --> 02:07:24.160
huge congested amounts of people if you have your ticket sales done in a more

02:07:24.160 --> 02:07:29.440
out-of-the-way location um a lot of our chat room really big on the East Coast

02:07:29.440 --> 02:07:34.680
idea I think somebody I think because of e3 getting overcrowded and over kind of

02:07:34.680 --> 02:07:38.960
bloated in a way. I think some of these East Coast shows are starting to pick up the slack

02:07:38.960 --> 02:07:42.080
a little bit, just naturally. Like, people are calling this digital life show that's

02:07:42.080 --> 02:07:45.880
coming up the East Coast E3, and that's just kind of a natural evolution.

02:07:45.880 --> 02:07:51.080
There are very few, as far as I know, there aren't as many game companies out on the East

02:07:51.080 --> 02:07:54.280
Coast as there are on the West Coast. That's very true.

02:07:54.280 --> 02:08:00.160
And it's significantly easier for, you know, basically LA is a local show for everyone

02:08:00.160 --> 02:08:01.240
in

02:08:01.240 --> 02:08:04.600
uh... but most of them are in the bay well not my i guess maybe not only

02:08:04.600 --> 02:08:08.160
has only four hours that's better than four days this is true of having to

02:08:08.160 --> 02:08:11.640
transport stuff four hours you know you can go home for a day take you know if

02:08:11.640 --> 02:08:12.800
you're flying

02:08:12.800 --> 02:08:16.800
you know what you can go down and and up every morning if you have to

02:08:16.800 --> 02:08:19.720
all right we're gonna move on uh... real quick well

02:08:19.720 --> 02:08:21.600
shoot i just got my keyboard that's no fun

02:08:21.600 --> 02:08:23.920
all right real quick though um... topping

02:08:23.920 --> 02:08:27.480
i thought it was part of this top thing that you think could be improved about

02:08:27.480 --> 02:08:28.480
E3.

02:08:28.480 --> 02:08:29.480
Loki.

02:08:29.480 --> 02:08:32.440
Top thing that you think could be improved about E3.

02:08:32.440 --> 02:08:35.240
Get rid of the retarded people that shouldn't be there.

02:08:35.240 --> 02:08:37.520
And let me into the goddamn Rockstar booth.

02:08:37.520 --> 02:08:41.440
Fuck, and they teased me the first time with Grand Theft Auto, and then they teased me

02:08:41.440 --> 02:08:43.080
again with these stupid buses.

02:08:43.080 --> 02:08:44.320
The hell with them.

02:08:44.320 --> 02:08:47.320
Dark Sakura.

02:08:47.320 --> 02:08:48.320
Thank you.

02:08:48.320 --> 02:08:50.700
Uh, more food vendors is my thing.

02:08:50.700 --> 02:08:51.700
More food vendors.

02:08:51.700 --> 02:08:54.400
That is completely stupid that I'm losing, like, an hour and a half of playing game time

02:08:54.400 --> 02:08:55.720
because I'm standing in line for food.

02:08:55.720 --> 02:08:56.720
That's awful.

02:08:56.720 --> 02:09:00.720
I seriously need to stop being run into by famous people.

02:09:00.720 --> 02:09:02.720
And closed door stuff should not...

02:09:02.720 --> 02:09:06.720
That's not the reason you're there. You're there to show stuff, not show stuff.

02:09:06.720 --> 02:09:10.720
But it's supposed to build the excitement about it by making it some secret deal.

02:09:10.720 --> 02:09:13.720
The biggest problem with E3 is they let Sinbad in.

02:09:13.720 --> 02:09:14.720
And Gary Coleman, what's up with that?

02:09:14.720 --> 02:09:18.720
Hey, John Cena was there last year, and he's pretty hot.

02:09:18.720 --> 02:09:23.720
All right, kids, we're going to get into the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match, or we're going to run out of time.

02:09:23.720 --> 02:09:26.620
The way the cage match works is that we play three songs for you guys.

02:09:26.620 --> 02:09:30.460
We play a clip of the song that won last week, and then two new songs, each host of course

02:09:30.460 --> 02:09:32.220
bringing one song to the table.

02:09:32.220 --> 02:09:33.420
You guys vote on your favorite.

02:09:33.420 --> 02:09:37.380
The winning song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's Bomani and Video

02:09:37.380 --> 02:09:41.080
Game Music program, which plays 24 hours a day, 7 days a week on the station.

02:09:41.080 --> 02:09:42.900
We are not live.

02:09:42.900 --> 02:09:46.700
Starting it off tonight is last week's winner, now going for its third win, I believe, if

02:09:46.700 --> 02:09:48.260
I'm not mistaken.

02:09:48.260 --> 02:09:49.980
It's something Loki picked a while back.

02:09:49.980 --> 02:09:53.660
It's a remix of V by Dorisia.

02:09:53.660 --> 02:09:58.140
the artist so it's one for the past two weeks will it win again tonight I just

02:09:58.140 --> 02:10:02.500
don't know we'll find out here it is song number one tonight a clip of last

02:10:02.500 --> 02:10:04.500
last week's winner, Thee.

02:11:32.500 --> 02:11:45.580
I turned the mics back on, right as you yawned, which was-

02:11:45.580 --> 02:11:46.580
I didn't have a-

02:11:46.580 --> 02:11:47.580
No, I was-

02:11:47.580 --> 02:11:48.580
Did I sleep?

02:11:48.580 --> 02:11:49.580
You're cutting out.

02:11:49.580 --> 02:11:51.580
I don't know what the hell's wrong with the cord there.

02:11:51.580 --> 02:11:52.580
Yo!

02:11:52.580 --> 02:11:53.580
There you are.

02:11:53.580 --> 02:11:54.580
All right.

02:11:54.580 --> 02:11:55.580
I was just- I was just being lulled to sleep.

02:11:55.580 --> 02:11:56.580
All right.

02:11:56.580 --> 02:11:59.620
That was song one, Dorisio with V. Will it win for the third week in a row?

02:11:59.620 --> 02:12:00.620
We'll find out.

02:12:00.620 --> 02:12:08.000
doing challenging it tonight the first one is my pick and I haven't won the

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:13.060
cage match in like three months seriously I have not won the cage

02:12:13.060 --> 02:12:16.180
match in three months so I decided tonight I just wasn't gonna pick a song

02:12:16.180 --> 02:12:21.300
so I let somebody else pick a song for me so and and and Miklotov's been

02:12:21.300 --> 02:12:24.180
begging and begging me for like two months or something to let him put a

02:12:24.180 --> 02:12:28.780
song in so here you go and I swear to God Miklotov if this song loses you

02:12:28.780 --> 02:12:33.020
never get another one in here no I'm just kidding but here it is this is a

02:12:33.020 --> 02:12:38.460
song by a group called pendulum and the song is called hold your color so we'll

02:12:38.460 --> 02:12:39.460
We'll see what you guys think.

02:12:39.460 --> 02:12:41.460
Here it is, song number two.

02:13:09.460 --> 02:13:33.300
When they take everything away Hold your colors against the wall

02:14:33.300 --> 02:14:39.940
Hold your guns against the wall

02:14:39.940 --> 02:14:45.620
And they take everything away

02:14:45.620 --> 02:14:54.260
Hold your guns against the wall

02:14:54.260 --> 02:15:21.260
I just want you to look into your eyes

02:15:21.260 --> 02:15:23.260
So I lay the name

02:15:23.260 --> 02:15:26.260
Don't try to save yourself

02:15:26.260 --> 02:15:29.260
This circle is complete

02:15:29.260 --> 02:15:33.260
Reaching out and to save you

02:15:33.260 --> 02:15:38.260
Nothing else can touch me

02:15:38.260 --> 02:15:41.260
So can't turn back now

02:15:41.260 --> 02:15:45.260
To cut us against the wall

02:15:45.260 --> 02:15:51.260
When they take everything away

02:15:51.260 --> 02:15:58.260
I want you guys to get to know

02:15:58.260 --> 02:16:00.260
I want you guys to get to know

02:16:00.260 --> 02:16:05.260
So I can see

02:16:05.260 --> 02:16:08.260
Open your eyes, twist and deny

02:16:08.260 --> 02:16:10.260
Open your eyes, twist and deny

02:16:10.260 --> 02:16:12.260
Open your eyes

02:16:12.260 --> 02:16:18.260
She looked into your eyes and saw what lay beneath

02:16:18.260 --> 02:16:23.260
Don't try to save yourself, the circle is complete

02:16:53.260 --> 02:16:57.260
Starting out to show it all

02:16:57.260 --> 02:17:02.260
When I'm reaching out, I do see you

02:17:02.260 --> 02:17:07.260
Nothing else can touch me

02:17:07.260 --> 02:17:09.260
So can I

02:17:09.260 --> 02:17:14.260
Come to girls against the rules

02:17:14.260 --> 02:17:20.260
When they take everything away

02:17:20.260 --> 02:17:28.900
I'm too close to get to be wrong

02:17:28.900 --> 02:17:37.380
I'm too close, I'm too close, I'm too close to get to be wrong

02:17:37.380 --> 02:17:42.260
Take everything out of your way

02:17:42.260 --> 02:17:45.400
Is it good? Is it good?

02:17:45.400 --> 02:17:50.100
In your eyes

02:17:50.100 --> 02:17:52.540
I'll know you're gonna say

02:17:53.660 --> 02:18:03.460
Don't open your eyes, don't represented the knife

02:18:07.960 --> 02:18:10.820
On our tune tonight skagematch pendulum

02:18:10.820 --> 02:18:12.820
Hold your color.

02:18:12.820 --> 02:18:14.820
We're not going to hold back our thoughts any longer.

02:18:14.820 --> 02:18:16.820
What do you guys think of that? Dark Sakura?

02:18:16.820 --> 02:18:18.820
Um...

02:18:18.820 --> 02:18:20.820
I like it a lot.

02:18:20.820 --> 02:18:23.820
I just felt it was a little long and got a little repetitive.

02:18:23.820 --> 02:18:26.820
But I really do like the song a lot, so it gets an 8.5.

02:18:26.820 --> 02:18:27.820
Low-key.

02:18:27.820 --> 02:18:29.820
I like the beginning of it, then it just kind of...

02:18:29.820 --> 02:18:31.820
I don't know.

02:18:31.820 --> 02:18:33.820
It drops off in my interest, I guess.

02:18:33.820 --> 02:18:35.820
Um, so 9.

02:18:35.820 --> 02:18:37.820
Bugged.

02:18:37.820 --> 02:18:39.820
Good driving song?

02:18:39.820 --> 02:18:48.820
I like that song more this time than the first time I heard it. I actually liked it a lot more this time, so I don't know what happened. I guess I was just in a crabby mood the other night.

02:18:48.820 --> 02:18:56.820
But I liked it, it was cool, but I agree, it kind of went on a little long, so if it had been like three minutes, it would have been cool. Five minutes, a little much.

02:18:56.820 --> 02:19:00.820
So I give it an eight and a half.

02:19:00.820 --> 02:19:06.820
Alright, song number three, Dark Sakura's pick. One more for you guys. Dark Sakura, what'd you pick first tonight?

02:19:06.820 --> 02:19:13.820
It's off the new M-Flow album, it's M-Flow Loves Benny K's Taste Your Stuff.

02:19:13.820 --> 02:19:15.820
Some M-Flow tonight.

02:19:15.820 --> 02:19:17.820
Yep, new M-Flow.

02:19:17.820 --> 02:19:18.820
Alright, new M-Flow.

02:19:18.820 --> 02:19:24.180
song number three tonight dark soccer's pick M flow loves Benny K with taste

02:19:24.180 --> 02:19:31.180

02:19:54.180 --> 02:20:02.740
Ain't nobody else Ain't nobody else

02:20:02.740 --> 02:20:24.740
Let's get out of here, oh no, ooh yeah You know I had enough of this baby, oh no, ooh yeah

02:20:24.740 --> 02:20:27.940
We could have been on a half-speed ride

02:20:43.240 --> 02:20:45.240
No one will say, no one will throw you

02:20:45.240 --> 02:20:46.740
But I'm just down to pay

02:20:46.740 --> 02:20:47.740
Bet I'm just down to pay

02:20:47.740 --> 02:20:48.740
Bet I'm just down to pay

02:20:48.740 --> 02:20:50.240
One, two, three

02:20:50.240 --> 02:20:51.740
I gotta get out, get out

02:20:51.740 --> 02:20:52.740
Let out the spot, good

02:20:52.740 --> 02:20:53.740
So many Ds, oh

02:20:53.740 --> 02:20:54.980
So many faces

02:20:54.980 --> 02:20:56.980
I got your eyes open, hold tight

02:20:56.980 --> 02:20:58.980
Gotta jowl, all the fun's breaking

02:20:58.980 --> 02:21:00.980
Uh-huh, uh-huh, what's the deal?

02:21:00.980 --> 02:21:02.980
Can't stop for y'all, that's the deal

02:21:02.980 --> 02:21:03.980
Now there's so many friends

02:21:03.980 --> 02:21:05.980
O-S-I-D-O-K-O-A-D-I

02:21:05.980 --> 02:21:06.980
Mada, mada, damn

02:21:06.980 --> 02:21:07.980
That's how we do

02:21:07.980 --> 02:21:09.980
It's more interesting to give it

02:21:09.980 --> 02:21:10.980
So much in front of you

02:21:10.980 --> 02:21:11.980
Very strong, but can't you

02:21:11.980 --> 02:21:12.980
Just communicate

02:21:12.980 --> 02:21:13.980
Show, start though

02:21:13.980 --> 02:21:14.980
Uh-huh

02:21:14.980 --> 02:21:15.980
We got the coffee

02:21:15.980 --> 02:21:16.980
Can't be so heat

02:21:16.980 --> 02:21:17.980
No small heat

02:21:17.980 --> 02:21:19.980
So now why can't I change the real story?

02:21:19.980 --> 02:21:20.980
I'm gonna meet you another showman

02:21:20.980 --> 02:21:25.980
I'm outta here, oh no, oh yeah

What? Hey, you don't wanna start this again?

02:21:47.980 --> 02:21:48.980
Well, what again?

02:21:48.980 --> 02:21:49.980
That's my style.

02:21:49.980 --> 02:21:50.980
Man, we're gonna see a Taurus, though.

02:21:50.980 --> 02:21:51.980
Too bad.

02:21:51.980 --> 02:21:52.980
You don't even wanna hear it.

02:21:52.980 --> 02:21:53.980
You'll be a 10.

02:21:53.980 --> 02:21:54.980
So I'm gonna kick you to the doorstep.

02:21:54.980 --> 02:21:55.980
What?

02:21:55.980 --> 02:21:56.980
Now I wanna take you instead.

02:21:56.980 --> 02:21:57.980
Uh-huh.

02:21:57.980 --> 02:21:58.980
Oh, you instead.

02:21:58.980 --> 02:21:59.980
Uh-huh.

02:21:59.980 --> 02:22:00.980
Gonna bite a horny moon.

02:22:00.980 --> 02:22:01.980
Uh-huh.

Hey, yo, so what moonshine?

02:22:05.980 --> 02:22:06.980
You can't say it?

02:22:06.980 --> 02:22:07.980
Uh-huh.

02:22:07.980 --> 02:22:08.980
Man, you still got the mouth.

02:22:08.980 --> 02:22:09.980
Say it.

02:22:09.980 --> 02:22:10.980
So moody, moody.

02:22:10.980 --> 02:22:11.980
Say it.

02:22:11.980 --> 02:22:12.980
Then I did just do it.

02:22:12.980 --> 02:22:13.980
Do it.

02:22:13.980 --> 02:22:20.980
You don't even know what to do now But yo, you don't even know what to say

But yo, you don't even know what you said

02:22:29.980 --> 02:22:31.980
Baby, why you gotta do that?

02:22:31.980 --> 02:22:33.980
I gotta do that

02:22:33.980 --> 02:22:36.980
Tell me baby, tell me what you're gonna do now

02:22:36.980 --> 02:22:38.980

02:23:00.980 --> 02:23:02.980
I'm here, I'm here

02:23:02.980 --> 02:23:04.980
You're here, you're here

02:23:04.980 --> 02:23:08.980
And now, it's even buggin' yesterday

02:23:12.980 --> 02:23:14.980
We could love another

02:23:14.980 --> 02:23:16.980
Let's get out of here!

02:23:29.980 --> 02:23:31.980
Okay, so it's song number three in tonight's cage match.

02:23:31.980 --> 02:23:35.980
M. Flo loves Benny K with Taste Your Stuff.

02:23:35.980 --> 02:23:37.980
Very interesting name for a song there.

02:23:37.980 --> 02:23:40.980
Let's see, did that leave a good taste or a bad taste in your mouth?

02:23:40.980 --> 02:23:41.980
Dark Sakura.

02:23:41.980 --> 02:23:43.980
M. Flo can do no wrong ten.

02:24:13.980 --> 02:24:18.940
a porno beat to it which is kind of cool so I give it like a eight and a half

02:24:18.940 --> 02:24:23.060
maybe nine I could be I could be talked into a nine eight and a half though for

02:24:23.060 --> 02:24:26.900
now all right let's recap the three songs you could vote for tonight

02:24:26.900 --> 02:24:33.380

02:24:33.380 --> 02:24:50.860
And song number two you can vote for tonight is Pendulum with Hold Your Color.

02:24:50.860 --> 02:24:56.300
And song number three you can vote for tonight is M-Flow Loves Benny K with Taste Your Stuff.

02:24:56.300 --> 02:24:58.500
Whoa, that's not it.

02:24:58.500 --> 02:25:03.500
How about this? Let's try this again. M-Flow loves Vinny K with Taste Your Stuff.

02:25:03.500 --> 02:25:18.260
All right, kids. You know what to do. Place, vote now. Send a private message to Skye in

02:25:18.260 --> 02:25:24.500
the chat room with your vote. Remember, screaming and hollering in the chat room will not count

02:25:24.500 --> 02:25:28.560
as a vote, although, you know, you may sway some other people, but I'm not encouraging

02:25:28.560 --> 02:25:30.080
you people to, uh, start flooding.

02:25:30.080 --> 02:25:31.920
Okay, the next person to type V.

02:25:31.920 --> 02:25:32.920
No flooding.

02:25:32.920 --> 02:25:38.440
Well, now you have to allow them to campaign for a song they might want, but, you know,

02:25:38.440 --> 02:25:39.440
no flooding.

02:25:39.440 --> 02:25:41.440
Yeah, the next person to type V.

02:25:41.440 --> 02:25:42.440
Yeah, don't flood.

02:25:42.440 --> 02:25:44.340
All right, so there you go.

02:25:44.340 --> 02:25:46.580
Have fun arguing about that.

02:25:46.580 --> 02:25:51.520
In the meantime, Loki, I'm really curious to hear what's going on in the sim scene.

For real? Please? Can I get that in writing?

02:27:06.080 --> 02:27:09.080

hooray for you people not all all of which i might add the uh... said who

02:27:54.500 --> 02:27:57.780
made them so no one by judging their

02:27:57.780 --> 02:28:02.020
which i i i i am i have thought there for not picking bromani songs and

02:28:02.020 --> 02:28:04.360
making steps for them like i think i got it

02:28:04.360 --> 02:28:08.060
bump down if you did something like that or something that because i was sick of

02:28:08.060 --> 02:28:11.300
seeing those so that is although it sounds like a budget dance mania speed

02:28:11.300 --> 02:28:14.120
songs are in there

02:28:14.120 --> 02:28:15.680
What can he do?

02:28:15.680 --> 02:28:19.960
Everybody loves their speed music. Man, of course I'm getting corrected in the chat room, it's not a Smile DK song.

02:28:19.960 --> 02:28:22.700
Where the hell have I heard that name before?

02:28:22.700 --> 02:28:25.640
Ding Ding Dong. I know I've heard that song name before.

02:28:25.640 --> 02:28:29.880
Like, it's on a DanceMania CD, I could swear.

02:28:29.880 --> 02:28:31.960
Oh well. I don't care.

02:28:31.960 --> 02:28:34.560
Are we looking? Alright.

02:28:34.560 --> 02:28:38.320
I wanted to play this for you guys. I feel like going to a Taiko parade all of a sudden.

02:28:38.320 --> 02:28:42.400
I know, he's still at it. Extrofer is still playing Taiko. You know what's funny?

02:28:42.400 --> 02:28:46.060
he bought the game at like five o'clock today okay he already has told me he's

02:28:46.060 --> 02:28:49.220
beat the game on easy which means he's played every song in the game on easy

02:28:49.220 --> 02:28:54.660
mode now and now he's going back through a normal mode well it's a damn good

02:28:54.660 --> 02:28:57.700
thing we don't have people living downstairs now they moved out the

02:28:57.700 --> 02:29:03.400
British soccer players moved out I know I know you said I want to play this for

02:29:03.400 --> 02:29:07.120
you guys this is an a cappella version of injection of love I think this is

02:29:07.120 --> 02:29:11.180
very interesting because what somebody did out there on one of the forums is

02:29:11.180 --> 02:29:15.900
that they took, um, and somebody, somebody, uh, Sakarina said this to me, so I can't remember

02:29:15.900 --> 02:29:19.820
where this came from, so sorry to whoever created this, but somebody took the instrumental

02:29:19.820 --> 02:29:25.940
version that's in Dance Dance Revolution Extreme 2 and cancelled that, or used that to cancel

02:29:25.940 --> 02:29:30.200
out that same noise in the 2DX Red version of the song, so they used that to strip it

02:29:30.200 --> 02:29:34.980
out, like cancel the noise. So what you're left with is Sana's vocals. So you should

02:29:34.980 --> 02:29:40.700
be able to hear nice and clear exactly what the woman's saying in this song. So we're

02:29:40.700 --> 02:29:46.700
gonna hear that part and I think she's supposed to say um stroke me she's

02:29:46.700 --> 02:29:51.900
supposed to say stroke me but I swear to God she says fuck me so we're gonna

02:29:51.900 --> 02:29:54.060
listen right now to a little bit of acapella here

02:29:54.060 --> 02:29:58.340
sauna injection of love so you can actually kind of hear the little Feds

02:29:58.340 --> 02:30:12.340
there in the background, so let's see if we can get into the...

02:30:12.340 --> 02:30:17.340
You can hear little bits of the music in there because the cancellation is not perfect.

02:30:17.340 --> 02:30:24.300
It sounds like playing a record backwards, doesn't it?

02:30:24.300 --> 02:30:28.300
Here it is.

02:30:28.300 --> 02:30:42.700
When you hear it like that, it doesn't sound like fuck so much, but it definitely sounds

02:30:42.700 --> 02:30:44.700
like froke me.

02:30:44.700 --> 02:30:46.700
Gently stroke me.

02:30:46.700 --> 02:30:50.700
Now you can kind of hear the stroke me a little bit when somebody puts it that way.

02:30:50.700 --> 02:30:54.700
But I swear to God it sounds like fuck in the original. It really, really does.

02:30:54.700 --> 02:30:58.700
She must not like it very rough if she's going Yasashi.

02:30:58.700 --> 02:31:00.700
One more time. Here it is.

02:31:04.700 --> 02:31:06.700
I think it's like froke me.

02:31:06.700 --> 02:31:10.700
How do you froke somebody?

02:31:10.700 --> 02:31:17.780
think about this it would if it were written out in katakana it would be

02:31:17.780 --> 02:31:29.860
sturoku so try saying suturo really fast and see how it comes out fuck me

02:31:29.860 --> 02:31:35.780
wow you're right seriously if you if you listen to that part again and listen to

02:31:35.780 --> 02:31:44.340
it as if the whole str little cluster there is actually three syllables what

02:31:44.340 --> 02:31:51.060
is there to stroke on her maybe her breasts and she wants it gently whatever

02:31:51.060 --> 02:31:58.600
I know what broke you and broke you and does she have a penis no I mean I'd not

02:31:58.600 --> 02:32:04.420
as far as I know no oh can you stroke a vagina look if you could oh god please

02:32:04.420 --> 02:32:10.420
You can't really do that, unless there's some really abnormalities and we're not going to go there.

02:32:10.420 --> 02:32:15.420
But, um, yeah, um, I don't think so.

02:32:15.420 --> 02:32:17.420
Alright.

02:32:17.420 --> 02:32:18.420
I don't...

02:32:18.420 --> 02:32:21.420
Seriously, play, but I'm for serious, play one more time.

02:32:21.420 --> 02:32:24.420
Isn't the clitoris, like, just another version of a penis?

02:32:24.420 --> 02:32:25.420
You know what?

02:32:25.420 --> 02:32:27.420
Never mind.

02:32:27.420 --> 02:32:29.420
I'll just let that spot answer.

02:32:29.420 --> 02:32:31.420
This is why you're gay.

02:32:31.420 --> 02:32:32.420
Just stay gay.

02:32:32.420 --> 02:32:35.420
Just stay gay. Don't try to do things that are outside your-

02:32:35.420 --> 02:32:40.420
Curiosity is bad. Curiosity led to the founding of countries.

02:32:40.420 --> 02:32:41.420
No, you're not getting the mic. Go back.

02:32:41.420 --> 02:32:42.420
Do they have a flag?

02:32:46.420 --> 02:32:47.420
Alright, here. Hold on.

02:32:47.420 --> 02:32:48.420
No flag, no country. You can't have one.

02:32:48.420 --> 02:32:51.420
Jamie was here one more time and then I swear to God we're dropping this subject forever.

02:32:53.420 --> 02:32:54.420
Alright, let's see. Here we go.

02:32:58.420 --> 02:32:59.420
See?

02:32:59.420 --> 02:33:02.420
If you listen to it with that in mind.

02:33:02.420 --> 02:33:09.420
But then again, you also broke off. Here's what we gotta say also. That's not going to rip her voice exactly how it was.

02:33:09.420 --> 02:33:11.420
It could have ripped off part of the voice.

02:33:11.420 --> 02:33:13.420
It didn't rip her voice. It ripped everything else out.

02:33:13.420 --> 02:33:18.420
Well, it might not have worked just perfectly, because I know when I try to take vocals out of stuff, sometimes you hear echoes in the background.

02:33:18.420 --> 02:33:21.420
You know what? We could actually run it through our computers and see what happens.

02:33:21.420 --> 02:33:25.420
Let's try doing this. We're going to, let me open up the file here.

02:33:25.420 --> 02:33:31.300
and then I'm gonna make some changes to it and just kind of you know do the

02:33:31.300 --> 02:33:35.500
cancellation thing and let's see what it sounds like this time let's let's let's

02:33:35.500 --> 02:33:39.020
listen to our version of it

02:33:39.020 --> 02:34:07.740
the original was doctored I think we should go to a break now oh wait

02:34:07.740 --> 02:34:08.740
Not before we get-

02:34:08.740 --> 02:34:09.740
Remember!

02:34:09.740 --> 02:34:10.740
What?

02:34:10.740 --> 02:34:11.740
Bleached katamari.

02:34:11.740 --> 02:34:12.740
Yeah, yeah, I know.

02:34:12.740 --> 02:34:13.740
Bleached katamari?

02:34:13.740 --> 02:34:15.500
Just, just, don't encourage the-

02:34:15.500 --> 02:34:17.060
Have I been out of the room too long?

02:34:17.060 --> 02:34:18.060
You have, you have.

02:34:18.060 --> 02:34:19.060
Oh.

02:34:19.060 --> 02:34:23.260
Um, but Extrofer, you're back just in time, because I'll be damned if we miss this.

02:34:23.260 --> 02:34:24.940
Please don't play the gay music.

02:34:24.940 --> 02:34:25.940
You get the gay music.

02:34:25.940 --> 02:34:29.100
I don't get the- I don't want the gay music.

02:34:29.100 --> 02:34:31.980
We need Extrofer's movie reveal.

02:34:31.980 --> 02:34:32.980
Extrofer-

02:34:32.980 --> 02:34:33.980
I need to choose the music for that.

02:34:33.980 --> 02:34:34.980
No.

02:34:34.980 --> 02:34:35.980
Extrofer.

02:34:35.980 --> 02:34:36.980
Oh.

02:34:36.980 --> 02:34:40.980
Well, I saw In Her Shoes yesterday.

02:34:40.980 --> 02:34:42.980
Isn't that a chick flick?

02:34:42.980 --> 02:34:44.980
It is not a chick flick.

02:34:44.980 --> 02:34:47.980
Well, it's a chick flick for gay guys.

02:34:47.980 --> 02:34:51.980
Does that make it a dick flick?

02:34:51.980 --> 02:34:54.980
It makes it a dick flick. It makes it a cock flick.

02:34:54.980 --> 02:34:56.980
So it's like Sex and the City.

02:34:56.980 --> 02:35:04.980
No, it's actually a movie about two sisters who go through some life-altering changes

02:35:04.980 --> 02:35:10.020
changes and how they kind of like come together but like it's a good movie if

02:35:10.020 --> 02:35:14.500
you're ever in the process of like you know unfortunately sometimes in your

02:35:14.500 --> 02:35:17.860
life you lose you may lose friends or you may be in the process of losing

02:35:17.860 --> 02:35:22.980
friends and it's it's a good movie to have to see when you're in that process

02:35:22.980 --> 02:35:32.860
but otherwise I mean it's it's it's a total conflict the female listeners of

02:35:32.860 --> 02:35:41.380
our show, thank you for that analogy. No problem, a thank you. I saw Serenity again. Yay! Talk

02:35:41.380 --> 02:35:45.220
about that. We have to go see Serenity next week. Let's go see Serenity next week. Let's

02:35:45.220 --> 02:35:48.820
do it. After Firefly. Somebody needs to go see Serenity. Next Friday we're gonna see

02:35:48.820 --> 02:35:53.340
Serenity again. Cause apparently- Blah, blah, blah, I got nine please. Okay, nevermind.

02:35:53.340 --> 02:36:00.060
Although we kind of spoiled it for Dan. Yeah, we spoiled it for Jamie's husband. Well don't

02:36:00.060 --> 02:36:03.900
spoil it for the listeners, please, but how did you spoil it without spoiling it for listeners?

02:36:03.900 --> 02:36:09.020
We just mentioned, oh, that's so sad. Yeah, and oh, that's so funny, and oh, that's

02:36:09.020 --> 02:36:13.060
so sad, how that was so funny, and oh, that's so, uh...

02:36:13.060 --> 02:36:18.620
And the people who will know what I'm talking about, you have this utter scene of, oh, and

02:36:18.620 --> 02:36:22.180
even a little bit of laughter, and all of a sudden, bam, dead silence.

02:36:22.180 --> 02:36:29.900
I know. It was crazy time. Without being a spoiler.

02:36:29.900 --> 02:36:33.440
I'm being corrected by one of our chatters who I'm going through trying to tally the

02:36:33.440 --> 02:36:34.520
cage match votes.

02:36:34.520 --> 02:36:38.000
The smile DK song is ding ding dong.

02:36:38.000 --> 02:36:40.400
Not ding dang dong.

02:36:40.400 --> 02:36:42.840
Okay people do you see how I got confused?

02:36:42.840 --> 02:36:43.840
Come on.

02:36:43.840 --> 02:36:44.840
With one vowel.

02:36:44.840 --> 02:36:47.840
Here's your serenity spoiler by the way.

02:36:47.840 --> 02:36:52.840
The reverb is not put on to do the hokey pokey and roller skates.

02:36:52.840 --> 02:36:55.520
And then I pee in bowls.

02:36:55.520 --> 02:36:56.520
You guys are weird.

02:36:56.520 --> 02:36:58.860
Do you still have your icons on your computer?

02:36:58.860 --> 02:37:02.280
deleted all those folders about it that you placed on my computer last week with

02:37:02.280 --> 02:37:06.240
that it makes me want to put some more on there I don't think on so we're

02:37:06.240 --> 02:37:10.320
gonna say about serenity and it being a ninth place huh yes serenity was the

02:37:10.320 --> 02:37:15.540
ninth place is it made so far about 17 point something million serenity needs

02:37:15.540 --> 02:37:27.440
to make $80,000 should we get 80 million hey we already got a sequel the chat

02:37:27.440 --> 02:37:29.440
That room is saying 19 million, actually.

02:37:29.440 --> 02:37:31.440
But remember, it's all estimates so far, so...

02:37:31.440 --> 02:37:34.440
Yeah, go to that mojo entertainment...

02:37:34.440 --> 02:37:35.440
Box office mojo is...

02:37:35.440 --> 02:37:36.440
Yeah, whatever that was.

02:37:36.440 --> 02:37:40.440
Everyone needs to see serenity a bajillion times, so declares me.

02:37:42.440 --> 02:37:49.440
To imagine how many times a bajillion is, imagine one time a bajillion times.

02:37:50.440 --> 02:37:52.440
That was really poor.

02:37:52.440 --> 02:37:53.440
Yeah.

02:37:53.440 --> 02:38:01.440
We haven't. I'm still running through all these freaking CAGEMATCH votes. I have never seen so many votes in the CAGEMATCH. Our chat room is passionate about this shit tonight.

02:38:01.440 --> 02:38:03.440
Alright.

02:38:03.440 --> 02:38:05.440
Alright, you guys ready to find out who won tonight's CAGEMATCH?

02:38:05.440 --> 02:38:07.440
We always thought about password protecting your computer.

02:38:07.440 --> 02:38:09.440
Girls, that's one!

02:38:09.440 --> 02:38:10.440
Why, what?

02:38:10.440 --> 02:38:11.440
So, cr-

02:38:11.440 --> 02:38:14.440
Aw, Jesus, did you just go in and make folders on your desktop?

02:38:14.440 --> 02:38:16.440
No. I could, shit.

02:38:16.440 --> 02:38:17.440
No?

02:38:17.440 --> 02:38:19.440
Hey, even I voted in the CAGEMATCH today, didn't I Rob?

02:38:19.440 --> 02:38:20.440
Stop it. What?

02:38:20.440 --> 02:38:22.440
Even I voted in the CAGEMATCH today.

02:38:22.440 --> 02:38:25.440
Because I'm the first guy's voice thinking for matching service.

02:38:52.440 --> 02:38:54.440
Thank you. Thank you, chat room. And thank you, actually-

02:38:54.440 --> 02:38:56.440
Thank you for giving Rob the pity, though.

02:38:56.440 --> 02:39:00.440
Yeah. And actually, Miek LaTov won it, and I didn't even win it, so...

02:39:00.440 --> 02:39:02.440
Fuck you, Miek LaTov.

02:39:02.440 --> 02:39:03.440
See, that's worth showing me up.

02:39:03.440 --> 02:39:07.440
Wilbur, what have I been telling you? Pick stuff other than generic trance, and you'll have a winner.

02:39:07.440 --> 02:39:09.440
I have been picking stuff other than generic trance.

02:39:09.440 --> 02:39:11.440
Pick Britney Spears' Toxic.

02:39:11.440 --> 02:39:12.440
Oh, God, no.

02:39:12.440 --> 02:39:13.440
I'm just kidding.

02:39:13.440 --> 02:39:17.440
I actually, it's funny, I actually did have a generic trance song, but it was really good.

02:39:17.440 --> 02:39:20.440
Well, that means that next week I have to play ABBA.

02:39:20.440 --> 02:39:24.440
I was actually disappointed that you did not choose ABBA tonight.

02:39:24.440 --> 02:39:29.440
I was trying to actually be serious, but I almost put in a Danger Doom track.

02:39:29.440 --> 02:39:34.440
Did you know that the new Madonna song actually samples ABBA?

02:39:34.440 --> 02:39:35.440
Really.

02:39:35.440 --> 02:39:39.440
And I honestly thought I had never heard the gayest song ever made,

02:39:39.440 --> 02:39:41.440
but I think this could possibly be it.

02:39:41.440 --> 02:39:47.440
Fusing Madonna and ABBA together could quite possibly be anal sex in song form.

02:39:47.440 --> 02:39:54.440
I've already heard foreplay in song form. Anyone who's ever seen Phantom of the Opera has.

02:39:54.440 --> 02:40:00.440
There should be an AB workout machine called ABBA. The ABBA. Whenever you crunch it, it gives you like...

02:40:00.440 --> 02:40:04.440
It's like, mama mia.

02:40:04.440 --> 02:40:06.440
Thanks for stopping, stupid.

02:40:06.440 --> 02:40:09.440
Alright.

02:40:09.440 --> 02:40:11.440
Oh my god, it's Rob.

02:40:11.440 --> 02:40:15.440
I've heard music in foreplay form before too, and it's going to start off this next break.

02:40:15.440 --> 02:40:20.440
break, and we'll be back with more Orange Lounge Radio, and the FUs of the week, we've

02:40:20.440 --> 02:40:23.520
got to get to those, we're running out of time. So we'll be right back after this break

02:40:23.520 --> 02:40:30.520
with more Orange Launch Radio.

02:42:23.520 --> 02:42:25.520
Oh

02:44:53.520 --> 02:45:13.520
I came in from a rainy surface on May Avenue

02:45:13.520 --> 02:45:20.520
Thought I heard you talking so fast

02:45:20.520 --> 02:45:27.520
I turn on the lights, I see the end of the radio

02:45:27.520 --> 02:45:34.520
Still I can't escape the ghost of you

02:45:34.520 --> 02:45:41.520
What has happened to it all, crazy some say

02:45:41.520 --> 02:45:47.520
Where is the light that I recognize?

02:45:47.520 --> 02:45:52.520
It's gone away, but I won't cry for yesterday

02:45:52.520 --> 02:46:02.520
There's an ordinary world, somehow I have to find

02:46:02.520 --> 02:46:10.520
And as I try to make my way to the ordinary world

02:46:10.520 --> 02:46:16.520
I will learn to survive

02:46:24.520 --> 02:46:29.520
For the best part of Orange Lounge, this GTR sucks!

02:46:29.520 --> 02:46:30.520
Holla!

02:46:30.520 --> 02:46:31.520
Stop! Stop! Stop!

02:46:31.520 --> 02:46:33.520
We want our women!

02:46:33.520 --> 02:46:34.520
That's right, PS!

02:46:34.520 --> 02:46:36.520
GG PO!

02:46:38.520 --> 02:46:39.520
We're back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:46:39.520 --> 02:46:44.520
We need more celebrity promos like that, actually. We need more promos in general.

02:46:44.520 --> 02:46:49.520
We just need to go out with a tape recorder and get more promos from people.

02:46:49.520 --> 02:46:54.520
Remember, the promos run all day long, though, on the stations. You'd have to keep it G-rated, because people do listen to us at work.

02:46:54.520 --> 02:46:59.520
I could utilize the word balls in a sentence without...

02:46:59.520 --> 02:47:04.520
I could say balls in a sentence without making it.

02:47:04.520 --> 02:47:11.760
In that break, you heard 4Play from 7th Style, so deep by Silvertear, because since Dark

02:47:11.760 --> 02:47:16.000
Soccer was talking about generic trance, I thought I'd give you some generic trance there.

02:47:16.000 --> 02:47:17.480
That's for generic.

02:47:17.480 --> 02:47:20.280
But the fans love it, go figure.

02:47:20.280 --> 02:47:25.200
Hoppin' Choppin' from DDR Mario, of course they're kind of interworking in that song

02:47:25.200 --> 02:47:31.960
from Mario Brothers 2, one of my favorite video games of all time and I can't remember

02:47:31.960 --> 02:47:33.120
the damn name of it.

02:47:33.120 --> 02:47:39.000
And then Aurora featuring Amy Coleman, Ordinary World, of course, another trance remix of

02:47:39.000 --> 02:47:44.160
an old song. Another thing you love, Dark Sakura, yes? When people take 70s and 80s

02:47:44.160 --> 02:47:45.160
songs...

02:47:45.160 --> 02:47:46.560
I particularly hate that version.

02:47:46.560 --> 02:47:52.040
I'll tell you... No, I heard one today that was really bad. It was a cover of Close to

02:47:52.040 --> 02:47:59.280
You by The Carpenters, but all it was, was like this... And then you'd hear this woman...

02:47:59.280 --> 02:48:04.280
like me, they want to be close to you.

02:48:04.280 --> 02:48:09.280
I have a version of that by Utada Hikaru.

02:48:09.280 --> 02:48:14.280
Well, I'm sure that's fine, but close to you has been done like a million times,

02:48:14.280 --> 02:48:19.280
and this one was especially offensive.

02:48:19.280 --> 02:48:23.280
We need to get to the FUs of the week, because I'll be damned if we're not running out of showtime.

02:48:23.280 --> 02:48:27.280
So chat room, when you guys send in your FUs tonight, you need to keep it short, because if you don't keep it short,

02:48:27.280 --> 02:48:29.240
You're getting cut off.

02:48:29.240 --> 02:48:31.640
I'm cutting you off tonight.

02:48:31.640 --> 02:48:33.720
So we're going to get into the FUs, and the same goes for...

02:48:33.720 --> 02:48:37.280
So just say, fuck you, to Rob, and that's it.

02:48:37.280 --> 02:48:41.560
Extifer, I will take that microphone away from you.

02:48:41.560 --> 02:48:44.040
Bugged, will you please babysit Extifer?

02:48:44.040 --> 02:48:46.200
That's going to be your new official show title, Bugged.

02:48:46.200 --> 02:48:48.040
You're Extifer's babysitter.

02:48:48.040 --> 02:48:49.280
Get it out of your red ass!

02:48:53.280 --> 02:48:54.200
Oh, lordy.

02:48:54.200 --> 02:48:59.920
Alright, um, in order for us to have the FUs of the Week, I'd better get, uh, Dark Soccer's song ready.

02:48:59.920 --> 02:49:02.800
Alright, Dark Soccer, why is it that we do the FUs of the Week every single week?

02:49:03.300 --> 02:49:04.500
Grr. Argh.

02:49:05.060 --> 02:49:07.880
That's such a nerd.

02:49:08.120 --> 02:49:12.680
Um, FU goes toward all of the traffic on my way up here.

02:49:13.180 --> 02:49:15.520
Um, FU goes toward Internet stalkers.

02:49:16.420 --> 02:49:22.320
Um, FU goes towards, um, my rash and amoxicillin.

02:49:22.320 --> 02:49:38.320
And the fact that my ass itches, and F you to add the blackboard for being down all day because A.R.C.'s website was dumb, I couldn't do my homework, so fuck all that, I'm done.

02:49:38.320 --> 02:49:40.320
Moving on to Loki!

02:49:40.320 --> 02:49:48.320
Um, well anyways, what? What the hell is your problem?

02:49:48.320 --> 02:49:50.500
you sick monomenon

02:49:50.500 --> 02:49:51.320
what?

02:49:51.320 --> 02:49:53.800
it's my song anyway

02:49:53.800 --> 02:49:58.660
fucking mcdonald's for making sub-par food and until they've recently fixed their cups

02:49:58.660 --> 02:50:01.700
for making cups that explode my cup holders

02:50:01.700 --> 02:50:05.400
that fucking sucks and also fucking to my neighbors who keep throwing their couches

02:50:05.400 --> 02:50:07.300
in the goddamn dumpster

02:50:07.300 --> 02:50:11.200
that is not what the dumpster is for, it's for trash not your fucking furniture

02:50:11.200 --> 02:50:14.980
you know pay for uh... it to be hauled away like everyone else

02:50:14.980 --> 02:50:17.800
and also uh...

02:50:17.800 --> 02:50:27.800
I'm so lucky to win this stupid free online film. Yeah, whatever. I hate that fucking Monopoly game. I'm done.

02:50:27.800 --> 02:50:44.160
I'd like to give an F.U. this week to ParanoiaSurvivorMax for showing up, way more than it's welcome

02:50:44.160 --> 02:50:50.640
on the totally random DDR Extreme match-up, but it's a good thing my life doesn't revolve

02:50:50.640 --> 02:50:51.640
around DDR.

02:50:51.640 --> 02:50:54.160
I might be upset about that.

02:50:54.160 --> 02:50:57.160
I'd also like to give an F.U. to

02:50:57.160 --> 02:51:00.480
the fact that I feel really, really unprepared for something that's about to take place a

02:51:00.480 --> 02:51:04.960
week from tomorrow and I'm not excited about it, but that's alright, life sucks for a birthday.

02:51:04.960 --> 02:51:06.200
No, it's not your birthday.

02:51:06.200 --> 02:51:06.840
Yes it is.

02:51:06.840 --> 02:51:10.640
Well, I mean, yes it is your birthday, but that's not why I'm mad. Shut up!

02:51:10.640 --> 02:51:13.000
This is my segment.

02:51:13.000 --> 02:51:15.080
And then, um...

02:51:15.080 --> 02:51:16.760
An F.U. to rainbows.

02:51:16.760 --> 02:51:19.240
Like the one on X to her shirt.

02:51:19.240 --> 02:51:23.640
Just kidding, I don't know. I'm actually not that angsty.

02:51:23.640 --> 02:51:27.480
all right let's go around and get uh other our guests in studio their fus uh bugged

And that's all.

02:51:50.080 --> 02:51:52.080
Extra verb.

02:51:52.080 --> 02:51:54.080
Uh, fuck you, bugs.

02:51:54.080 --> 02:52:06.080
Oh, no, no, no, no. I don't have really any FUs other than, uh, let's see, FU to things that suck.

02:52:06.080 --> 02:52:11.080
I don't know. No, not F you to things that suck, because things that suck are sometimes really good.

02:52:17.080 --> 02:52:20.080
Stop looking at me like, hurry up and finish! That's done!

02:52:20.080 --> 02:52:22.080
Oh, okay, you need to say something.

02:52:22.080 --> 02:52:28.080
I climax, so hey, I'm done, I'm done, okay? Sexual reference. End.

02:52:30.080 --> 02:52:32.080

kostjamrh I swear I heard that lyric somewhere before.

02:56:44.440 --> 02:56:45.440
He doesn't curse in his music.

02:56:45.440 --> 02:56:46.440
He samples everybody.

02:56:46.440 --> 02:56:47.440
Yes he does.

02:56:47.440 --> 02:56:54.440
Oh, we had one late F.U.

02:56:54.440 --> 02:56:59.400
Morty says, froke frigid roommates.

02:56:59.400 --> 02:57:00.400
Frigid roommates.

02:57:00.400 --> 02:57:01.400
I agree.

02:57:01.400 --> 02:57:03.040
Shut up, asshole.

02:57:03.040 --> 02:57:05.520
I'm not frigid.

02:57:05.520 --> 02:57:06.520
I'll have you know.

02:57:06.520 --> 02:57:07.520
I was quite warm.

02:57:07.520 --> 02:57:08.520
Never mind.

02:57:08.520 --> 02:57:09.520
Just kidding.

02:57:09.520 --> 02:57:10.520
I'm kidding.

02:57:10.520 --> 02:57:11.520
I'm kidding.

02:57:11.520 --> 02:57:12.520
All right.

02:57:12.520 --> 02:57:17.520
God, we're running out of time on the show. They want to do Ask Orange Lounge, but we don't really have the time, so I think we're going to have to take it.

02:57:17.520 --> 02:57:18.520
Let's do it.

02:57:18.520 --> 02:57:19.520
Want to do it real quick?

02:57:19.520 --> 02:57:20.520
Just do it.

02:57:20.520 --> 02:57:21.520
Yes.

02:57:21.520 --> 02:57:23.520
All right. You know, because we still got the podcast to do, and you want to go out.

02:57:23.520 --> 02:57:24.520
I know.

02:57:24.520 --> 02:57:25.520
All right.

02:57:25.520 --> 02:57:29.520
But where would we be without our fans probably in bed?

02:57:29.520 --> 02:57:31.520
All right.

02:57:31.520 --> 02:57:32.520
Doing what in bed?

02:57:32.520 --> 02:57:33.520
No.

02:57:33.520 --> 02:57:34.520
Big cut.

02:57:34.520 --> 02:57:37.520
Slumber party.

02:57:37.520 --> 02:57:40.520
All right, guys. Fine. We'll do really quick Ask Orange Lounge.

02:57:40.520 --> 02:57:43.860
parties with a bunch of people and the first girl who fell asleep we would take

02:57:43.860 --> 02:57:48.300
her bra and stuff like dip it in orange juice and put it in the freezer. My

02:57:48.300 --> 02:57:52.100
sister and her friend did that to one of their friends one time. It was really

02:57:52.100 --> 02:57:55.460
funny. And then when the last person to stay awake would go and put toothpaste

02:57:55.460 --> 02:57:58.980
on the toilet seat so that the first person who woke up in half asleep mode

02:57:58.980 --> 02:58:14.080
to go use the bathroom would stick to the toilet wow let's ask orange lounge

02:58:14.080 --> 02:58:19.800
some stupid question what will we find out this week on orange lounge radio I

02:58:19.800 --> 02:58:24.720
think it's very interesting we didn't even need a question to find out that

02:58:24.720 --> 02:58:31.720
Jamie played with other girls bras.

02:58:34.200 --> 02:58:39.200
Fireboma said, where do babies come from? No seriously, I don't know.

02:58:39.200 --> 02:58:42.720
I will let Extrofer answer this question on behalf of Orange Lounge Radio.

02:58:42.720 --> 02:58:49.720
Extrofer, where do babies come from? Babies come from a females coup.

02:58:49.720 --> 02:58:54.720
Legend of Zaku said, you guys seriously need a Wikipedia entry.

02:58:54.720 --> 02:58:56.720
We do. How do we do that?

02:58:56.720 --> 02:58:58.720
Someone has to make us one.

02:58:58.720 --> 02:59:01.720
Somebody make us one. Is Bug going to do it?

02:59:01.720 --> 02:59:05.720
Bug's working on it right now. Do people have to vote on it to make it stick?

02:59:05.720 --> 02:59:08.720
Oh good. Okay, Bug's going to write that right now. Thank you, Zaku.

02:59:08.720 --> 02:59:09.720
The Ferret needs an entry too.

02:59:09.720 --> 02:59:10.720
We'll post that though.

02:59:10.720 --> 02:59:13.720
Oh, other things I want to point out.

02:59:13.720 --> 02:59:25.720
I'd like to point out, um, vote us a five on your player window in line 365 speaking of like voting stuff, and for the love of God, vote for us on podcast alley, because we're really falling behind over there.

02:59:25.720 --> 02:59:38.720
So for your convenience, I'm going to post a link to where you can vote for our show, and you should do that right now, because that's a really good way for our podg- podcast to get exposure.

02:59:38.720 --> 02:59:40.720
I hate that podcast.

02:59:40.720 --> 02:59:42.720
It's a gas.

02:59:42.720 --> 02:59:44.720
Alright.

02:59:44.720 --> 02:59:46.720
Um, oh did somebody already do it?

02:59:46.720 --> 02:59:50.720
Somebody posted a Wikipedia link.

02:59:50.720 --> 02:59:52.720
Did somebody already do it?

02:59:52.720 --> 02:59:55.720
Somebody probably just made an entry that says it sucks.

02:59:55.720 --> 02:59:57.720
It stinks.

02:59:57.720 --> 03:00:00.720
Oh no it's not. Okay.

03:00:00.720 --> 03:00:02.720
Yeah you need to start. Somebody needs to hurry up and write it.

03:00:02.720 --> 03:00:04.720
Alright.

03:00:04.720 --> 03:00:09.960
sakorina says why is american thanksgiving later than canadian

03:00:09.960 --> 03:00:12.120
thanksgiving which is now

03:00:12.120 --> 03:00:13.160
wait a second

03:00:13.160 --> 03:00:14.400
oh yes loki

03:00:14.400 --> 03:00:17.200
why do the canadians get thanksgiving anyways?

03:00:17.200 --> 03:00:19.520
how many indians did they kill? come on

03:00:19.520 --> 03:00:20.800
exactly

03:00:20.800 --> 03:00:24.680
they didn't rape the land of indians

03:00:24.680 --> 03:00:26.440
no just kidding

03:00:26.440 --> 03:00:27.280
uh...

03:00:27.280 --> 03:00:30.960
god we're horribly offensive sometimes i really hope we didn't offend anybody with that comment

03:00:30.960 --> 03:00:35.040
but um... if anything we should be giving thanks for maple syrup because that's what they're

03:00:35.040 --> 03:00:36.040
known for

03:00:36.040 --> 03:00:41.920
that and brian adams. I really don't know why thanksgiving is later

03:00:41.920 --> 03:00:44.040
it's all timed

03:00:44.040 --> 03:00:47.760
for the shopping industry

03:00:47.760 --> 03:00:51.760
i know i know

03:00:56.760 --> 03:00:59.800
wasn't michael j fox from canada

03:00:59.800 --> 03:01:01.800
What about David Duchovny?

03:01:01.800 --> 03:01:03.800
Somebody in the chatroom is saying if DDR...

03:01:03.800 --> 03:01:06.800
Do you remember that song, David Duchovny, Why Won't You Love Me?

03:01:06.800 --> 03:01:07.800
No.

03:01:07.800 --> 03:01:09.800
Someone wrote a song about him.

03:01:09.800 --> 03:01:14.800
If somebody in the chatroom is saying that DDR Freak is not allowed to have a Wikipedia entry, so why should we?

03:01:14.800 --> 03:01:17.800
Who said DDR Freak is not allowed to have a Wikipedia entry? That's not cool.

03:01:17.800 --> 03:01:18.800
Maybe I can have one.

03:01:18.800 --> 03:01:20.800
Yeah, make them one. I don't care.

03:01:20.800 --> 03:01:22.800
I think they had one and it got removed or something.

03:01:22.800 --> 03:01:24.800
Somebody probably complained about it.

03:01:24.800 --> 03:01:25.800
Let me have a look.

03:01:25.800 --> 03:01:30.800
If we get a Wikipedia entry posted, just fucking don't complain about it, and we'll be fine.

03:01:30.800 --> 03:01:35.800
So don't tattle. If you tattle, I will come find you and beat you up, and it will not be a good thing.

03:01:35.800 --> 03:01:40.800
Because you're probably the end of feeding Rafa.

03:01:40.800 --> 03:01:43.800
Jayda's arms are flailing.

03:01:43.800 --> 03:01:46.800
We're already running late. No more questions, people. These are the last ones.

03:01:46.800 --> 03:01:53.800
Jayda2005 says, why is it cheaper to rent movies and expensive to rent video games?

03:01:53.800 --> 03:01:58.600
Because video games are more expensive than movies video games such a back like 50 bucks games only such or movies now

03:01:58.600 --> 03:02:03.240
I said you back like 25 exactly and they have to you know rent more times in order to make their money back

03:02:05.280 --> 03:02:10.800
And stop stealing games people stop stealing them for the rental stores, that's what the Internet's for

03:02:12.040 --> 03:02:18.520
If I mispronounce this, I'm really sorry. I don't know if it's just II or just with like the silent II

03:02:18.520 --> 03:02:22.880
I'm not sure if the East Islander night huh was it I think just I'm gonna go with just okay

03:02:23.400 --> 03:02:28.600
But it could be just a it could be like just a like Jack a this person's gonna kick my ass

03:02:28.600 --> 03:02:33.920
I'm gonna go with just all right. Why did you decide to start making an online radio show um?

03:02:34.960 --> 03:02:37.180
Me personally your turn, okay?

03:02:37.180 --> 03:02:42.120
I've been doing online radio personally since I was in college which was a long time ago

03:02:42.120 --> 03:02:48.260
I'm actually not that old, but I was doing a college radio show, and then I got invited

03:02:48.260 --> 03:02:53.140
to be on another internet radio program called Understation Live, that was years ago, and

03:02:53.140 --> 03:02:56.180
that just kind of turned into this, where it was like, you know what, we have fun doing

03:02:56.180 --> 03:03:00.500
Understation Live, let's do a show about video games, and sure enough, here we are, Dark

03:03:00.500 --> 03:03:02.820
Sakura was a frequent guest on that show.

03:03:02.820 --> 03:03:09.780
Loki just kind of showed up, but it worked out, so Loki's still here.

03:03:09.780 --> 03:03:16.780
juice day. It is juice day. Not just stay, but juice day. Just for the record.

03:03:17.780 --> 03:03:24.780
Alright. SSJ100Matt, what? Oh, I was just going to say, like, juice stay in your chair.

03:03:25.780 --> 03:03:30.780
Shut up. I haven't got any rules on Wikipedia yet.

03:03:31.780 --> 03:03:37.780
SSJ100Matt wants to know, I may be the only person on Earth to break an afterburner pad.

03:03:37.780 --> 03:03:39.780
Am I the only one to break one?

03:03:39.780 --> 03:03:41.780
Umm...

03:03:41.780 --> 03:03:42.780
No.

03:03:42.780 --> 03:03:43.780
No.

03:03:43.780 --> 03:03:44.780
Loki says no.

03:03:44.780 --> 03:03:45.780
How do you know this for a fact, Loki?

03:03:45.780 --> 03:03:49.780
Cause that's ridiculous to say that you're the only person that's broken one.

03:03:49.780 --> 03:03:51.780
They're not indestructible.

03:03:51.780 --> 03:03:55.780
I'm sure at some point, like, somebody who weighed like 700 pounds tried to play on one

03:03:55.780 --> 03:03:57.780
and probably broke it.

03:03:57.780 --> 03:03:59.780
So, I think that's safe to say, wouldn't you?

03:03:59.780 --> 03:04:00.780
Sure.

03:04:00.780 --> 03:04:04.780
You're probably not the first, but you might be one of a very select few.

03:04:04.780 --> 03:04:06.780
And that's something to be proud about.

03:04:06.780 --> 03:04:21.100
Why did Midway delay the GameCube version of Midway Arcade Treasures 3, and why did

03:04:21.100 --> 03:04:24.100
my laptop just lag for like 12 minutes straight?

03:04:24.100 --> 03:04:29.720
GameCube games seem to be getting finished last, like for example Rainbow Six Lockdown

03:04:29.720 --> 03:04:32.040
didn't come out until two weeks later.

03:04:32.040 --> 03:04:35.340
Same with Midway Arcade Treasures, it doesn't come out until two weeks later.

03:04:35.340 --> 03:04:38.220
Some of the Mortal Kombat games came out way later for GameCube, too, right?

03:04:38.220 --> 03:04:39.220
The reception.

03:04:39.220 --> 03:04:40.220
Some like that.

03:04:40.220 --> 03:04:44.380
Yeah, it's just, I don't know, either they have to go through some, like, process of,

03:04:44.380 --> 03:04:47.860
you know, Nintendo has to review it or something, or, I don't know.

03:04:47.860 --> 03:04:51.460
For whatever reason, it's delayed.

03:04:51.460 --> 03:04:52.460
Very interesting.

03:04:52.460 --> 03:04:53.460
All right.

03:04:53.460 --> 03:04:55.780
We've got to call it a show, boys and girls.

03:04:55.780 --> 03:04:56.780
We're done here.

03:04:56.780 --> 03:05:00.020
And, sorry, Nintendo Mania, I can't help you with your laptop.

03:05:00.020 --> 03:05:01.700
Call your local computer experts.

03:05:01.700 --> 03:05:02.700
All right.

03:05:02.700 --> 03:05:06.700
Final thoughts, you guys? It's the end of the show. Bud, your final thought?

03:05:06.700 --> 03:05:09.700
I like my PSP.

03:05:09.700 --> 03:05:11.700
Extifer, your final thought?

03:05:11.700 --> 03:05:18.700
Uh, stop it. I like, um, I don't like his PSP.

03:05:18.700 --> 03:05:21.700
Loki, your final thought?

03:05:21.700 --> 03:05:26.700
I have too many GameStop receipts.

03:05:26.700 --> 03:05:28.700
My final thought is, meow.

03:05:28.700 --> 03:05:29.700
Dark Sakura?

03:05:29.700 --> 03:05:32.700
Reject Plus Icons, Bleacher Katamari

03:05:33.700 --> 03:05:35.700
Final Word of the Show, one word to sum it all up

03:05:35.700 --> 03:05:38.700
We're running late but thanks you guys very much for tuning in tonight and listening to us

03:05:38.700 --> 03:05:40.700
We appreciate it, that's as far as the corn goes there

03:05:40.700 --> 03:05:43.700
Alright, thank you guys very much for tuning in and listening to us tonight

03:05:43.700 --> 03:05:44.700
We appreciate it

03:05:44.700 --> 03:05:47.700
Whore us up, tell a friend that you love Orange Launch Radio

03:05:47.700 --> 03:05:50.700
Tell a friend that you hate Orange Launch Radio because they might still check it out

03:05:50.700 --> 03:05:52.700
And that's it, thank you guys, we'll see you next week

03:05:52.700 --> 03:05:56.700
One word to sum it all up, Dark Sakura, what is tonight's final word?

03:05:56.700 --> 03:05:58.700
Itchy, Tasty

03:05:58.700 --> 03:06:00.700
That does it for another...

03:06:00.700 --> 03:06:02.700
Hold on, that was two. That was two!

03:06:02.700 --> 03:06:04.700
You pick one. You pick one or the other.

03:06:04.700 --> 03:06:07.700
I had to quote the game, but it's itchy.

03:06:07.700 --> 03:06:13.700
That does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live.

03:06:13.700 --> 03:06:18.700

And now, here is your fortune cookie message of the day.

03:06:49.700 --> 03:06:53.700
I miss you more than Michael Bay missed the mark

03:06:53.700 --> 03:06:57.700
when he made Pearl Harbor

03:06:57.700 --> 03:07:01.700
I miss you more than that movie missed the point

03:07:01.700 --> 03:07:05.700
and that's an awful lot girl

03:07:05.700 --> 03:07:09.700
and now, now you've gone away

03:07:09.700 --> 03:07:13.700
and all I'm trying to say

03:07:13.700 --> 03:07:15.700
Is Pearl Harbor suck

03:07:16.700 --> 03:07:18.700
And I miss you

03:07:26.700 --> 03:07:30.700
I need you like Ben Affleck needs acting school

03:07:31.700 --> 03:07:34.700
He was terrible in that film

03:07:34.700 --> 03:07:36.700
I need you like Cuba good

03:07:36.700 --> 03:07:38.700
He needed a bigger part

03:07:38.700 --> 03:07:46.700
He's way better than Ben Affleck now All I can think about is your smile

03:07:46.700 --> 03:07:52.700
And that shitty movie too For all the sun

03:07:52.700 --> 03:07:57.700
And I miss you

03:08:11.700 --> 03:08:18.700
Why does Michael Bay get to keep on making movies

03:08:18.700 --> 03:08:21.700
I guess Pearl Harbor sucks

03:08:21.700 --> 03:08:28.700
Just a little bit more than I miss you

03:08:51.700 --> 03:08:57.740
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.

03:09:21.700 --> 03:09:45.780
