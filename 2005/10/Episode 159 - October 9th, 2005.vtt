03:53.220 --> 04:03.127
[SPEAKER_22]: On tonight's program, we're going to be talking a little bit about Extreme 2's online mode, because I got a chance to play that this week, and we're also going to be talking a little bit about Tycho Drummaster, because...

04:03.767 --> 04:10.150
[SPEAKER_22]: Xtifer picked that up this week and he's like obsessed with Taiko Drum Master all of a sudden so we definitely have to talk to him about that and his movie review.

04:10.611 --> 04:15.453
[SPEAKER_22]: All that and all the other crap you're used to here on this lovely program known as Orange Lounge Radio.

04:15.493 --> 04:16.093

[SPEAKER_18]: Orange Lounge may contain plenty of... Just kidding.

05:41.243 --> 05:44.966
[SPEAKER_22]: Orange Lounge Radio will not contain any of that in this episode.

05:45.266 --> 05:46.907

06:20.984 --> 06:26.449
[SPEAKER_22]: You're tuned in to Orange Lounge Radio, radio that gamers really want, and this...

06:26.909 --> 06:27.149
[SPEAKER_22]: DarkSakura

06:51.874 --> 06:53.595
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, I'm actually not sure where she's at.

06:53.635 --> 06:59.036
[SPEAKER_22]: I know she said something about homework was probably going to delay her a little bit, but we'll see what's going on.

06:59.096 --> 07:03.097
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm sure she's going to run through the door any minute now going, ah, traffic, or the line at Safeway or something.

07:03.117 --> 07:03.898
[SPEAKER_22]: So she'll be here any minute.

07:04.538 --> 07:06.418
[SPEAKER_22]: But we're here with us.

07:06.858 --> 07:09.959
[SPEAKER_22]: And by the way, when DarkSakura does get here, everybody, fired!

07:11.220 --> 07:11.600
[SPEAKER_22]: Just kidding.

07:12.240 --> 07:12.960
[SPEAKER_22]: I could never fire her.

07:13.100 --> 07:13.660
[SPEAKER_22]: She'd kick my ass.

07:14.621 --> 07:16.521
[SPEAKER_22]: Right here is the one and only Loki.

07:16.541 --> 07:17.181
[SPEAKER_22]: Hello.

07:17.742 --> 07:18.302
[SPEAKER_22]: How you doing, Loki?

07:19.502 --> 07:24.264
[SPEAKER_22]: Good, except I'm good in the department of developing pictures.

07:25.004 --> 07:27.245
[SPEAKER_22]: We'll talk about this later, because I want to talk about how stupid that thing is.

07:27.306 --> 07:28.506
[SPEAKER_22]: So we'll talk about that in a little bit.

07:28.526 --> 07:31.007
[SPEAKER_22]: I noticed Loki is sporting his In the Courtroom shirt today.

07:31.107 --> 07:31.347
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

07:31.848 --> 07:36.410
[SPEAKER_22]: So those of you guys that won prizes a couple weeks ago, we finally got the In the Courtroom shirts.

07:36.710 --> 07:38.130
[SPEAKER_22]: So our grand prize winner, who won that?

07:38.150 --> 07:40.171
[SPEAKER_22]: Justin and Icy, I think, won the haiku thing.

07:40.311 --> 07:40.491
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

07:40.571 --> 07:43.633
[SPEAKER_22]: We're going to be sending the In the Courtroom shirt along with the In the Groove game this week.

07:44.193 --> 07:55.044
[SPEAKER_22]: And I'll tell you what, I can't say anything about something that's in the works right now, but I'll be damned if this isn't the best week for us to be doing this.

07:56.005 --> 07:57.507
[SPEAKER_22]: Save it for next week, because it's going to be great.

07:57.707 --> 07:58.548
[SPEAKER_13]: That's all I can say.

07:59.229 --> 07:59.569
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, I know.

08:00.230 --> 08:04.754
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyway, we're here though, and we're going to be talking about all sorts of other stuff.

08:05.315 --> 08:07.377
[SPEAKER_22]: Bugged is also here tonight, one of our guests.

08:08.789 --> 08:09.049
[SPEAKER_12]: Howdy.

08:09.469 --> 08:09.950
[SPEAKER_22]: How you doing?

08:10.470 --> 08:11.390
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, I have a PSP.

08:12.511 --> 08:13.452
[SPEAKER_12]: And fuck traffic, apparently.

08:13.652 --> 08:14.072
[SPEAKER_22]: I knew it.

08:14.432 --> 08:14.952
[SPEAKER_22]: What did I say?

08:14.992 --> 08:18.835
[SPEAKER_22]: I said she'd walk in here and she'd go, fuck traffic or fuck the line at Safeway.

08:19.235 --> 08:19.715
[SPEAKER_22]: One of the two.

08:21.496 --> 08:22.497
[SPEAKER_22]: Hi, DarkSakura, how are you?

08:23.857 --> 08:24.318
[SPEAKER_22]: That's your butt.

08:26.719 --> 08:27.079
[SPEAKER_08]: Next.

08:27.940 --> 08:28.260
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright.

08:30.097 --> 08:33.441
[SPEAKER_22]: So we're here and we're about ready to get started with tonight's show.

08:33.782 --> 08:36.886
[SPEAKER_22]: Extifer is out in the front room playing Taiko Drum Master.

08:37.246 --> 08:37.707
[SPEAKER_22]: My fault.

08:37.827 --> 08:38.668
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, your fault.

08:38.728 --> 08:40.370
[SPEAKER_22]: I'll be talking to you about that later.

08:41.533 --> 08:42.174
[SPEAKER_22]: We'll get into that.

08:42.794 --> 08:44.375
[SPEAKER_22]: Meanwhile, though, let's get tonight's show started.

08:44.435 --> 08:45.256
[SPEAKER_22]: Get your butt in the chatroom.

08:45.276 --> 08:45.836
[SPEAKER_22]: WarrenTalentRadio.com.

08:45.856 --> 08:46.617
[SPEAKER_22]: We're going to come back.

08:46.637 --> 08:55.464
[SPEAKER_22]: We're going to talk a little bit about some things going on in the Bomani scene, although it's kind of a slow news week because everybody's playing Dance Dance Revolution Extreme 2.

08:56.124 --> 08:59.247
[SPEAKER_22]: I want to talk about online mode a little bit, though, because I finally got into online mode today.

08:59.287 --> 09:00.007
[SPEAKER_22]: It's very interesting.

09:00.328 --> 09:02.790
[SPEAKER_22]: And I can talk about my gaming router adventures and everything, so it'll be fun.

09:02.810 --> 09:04.111
[SPEAKER_22]: We're going to have a fun show, kids.

09:04.151 --> 09:05.011
[SPEAKER_22]: We'll be back after this.

09:05.031 --> 09:06.753
[SPEAKER_22]: We're going to start it off this break with a song.

09:07.293 --> 09:14.820
[SPEAKER_22]: That definitely had a lot of people talking last week, and we're going to talk about it a little bit more this week, but we're going to play the original, uncensored version of Injection of Love.

09:14.860 --> 09:15.641
[SPEAKER_22]: We'll be back after this.

09:50.327 --> 09:50.812
and many more.

11:06.823 --> 11:07.928
Thanks for watching!

11:38.695 --> 11:40.236
Thanks for watching!

13:27.188 --> 13:28.289
and the rest of the crew.

14:17.018 --> 14:20.824
Thanks for watching!

15:16.443 --> 15:17.264
Thanks for watching!

15:57.116 --> 15:58.617
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, did you hear about that show?

15:59.097 --> 15:59.678
[SPEAKER_01]: What show?

15:59.998 --> 16:05.461
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they play a lot of great Fermanian video game music, but if you listen to it, you have to listen to it again within seven days.

16:05.862 --> 16:07.143
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, I've heard of that station.

16:07.243 --> 16:07.583
[SPEAKER_22]: Really?

16:07.983 --> 16:10.104
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, I even listened to it a couple weeks ago.

16:10.585 --> 16:12.846
[SPEAKER_22]: Hey, what happens to you if you don't listen to it again?

16:13.046 --> 16:14.007
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, you die.

16:14.627 --> 16:15.188
[SPEAKER_22]: I, what?

16:15.988 --> 16:20.131
[SPEAKER_22]: Hey, wait, what's this crazy bitch doing coming out of my computer screen?

16:22.274 --> 16:24.801
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge Radio Listen or DIE!

16:28.496 --> 16:32.978
[SPEAKER_22]: Hi, we're back on Orange Lounge Radio, here, episode number 159.

16:33.598 --> 16:39.121
[SPEAKER_22]: God, every week I say one higher number, and I think, God damn, we've been doing this show a long time.

16:39.521 --> 16:41.262
[SPEAKER_22]: We're in, like, what, studio number three?

16:42.402 --> 16:50.065
[SPEAKER_22]: Actually, really it's four, if you think about it, because the show has been done, no, studio number five, because the show has been done at two of DarkSakura's places.

16:50.346 --> 16:52.186
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, because I moved once and I moved again.

16:52.306 --> 16:55.588
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, so, this show gets around quite a bit, so...

16:56.206 --> 16:56.906
[SPEAKER_06]: We're such a hoe.

17:12.369 --> 17:13.409
[SPEAKER_22]: DarkSakura, what the hell?

17:13.489 --> 17:14.069
[SPEAKER_22]: What did you do?

17:14.089 --> 17:35.155
[SPEAKER_06]: Friday night we had our supposed to be weekly Firefly Marathon, and we went out to do Late Night Lions and came back, and I was actually hunting down the Turbo Duo to play some Dracula X, and instead, Dan's like, put up your free Taiko

17:35.635 --> 17:42.417
[SPEAKER_06]: Drum Master, so I did, and I have an RO pad, I'm not going to say the name.

17:44.218 --> 17:46.878
[SPEAKER_06]: But I also have, of course, the original, because Dan got all that for free for me.

17:47.599 --> 17:51.120
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we played a bunch, like two songs.

17:51.820 --> 17:53.560
[SPEAKER_06]: My hands were bruised by the time I was done.

17:53.780 --> 17:54.160
[SPEAKER_06]: Good deal.

17:54.841 --> 17:56.321
[SPEAKER_06]: And I won the watermelon contest.

17:57.421 --> 17:58.722
[SPEAKER_22]: The watermelon contest?

17:58.962 --> 17:59.762
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, and the mini game.

17:59.802 --> 18:01.262
[SPEAKER_22]: I haven't really played enough Taiko Dramas.

18:01.302 --> 18:02.503
[SPEAKER_22]: I've played Taiko No Tachigen.

18:03.206 --> 18:04.366
[SPEAKER_22]: But I don't remember that minigame.

18:04.386 --> 18:06.727
[SPEAKER_06]: So are you going to be importing some of the Taiko no Tatsujin?

18:06.747 --> 18:06.887
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

18:07.367 --> 18:11.648
[SPEAKER_22]: I've played like three different Taiko no Tatsujin games thanks to Navi the Pop and Music Whore.

18:12.348 --> 18:13.388
[SPEAKER_22]: He has like all of them.

18:13.568 --> 18:14.528
[SPEAKER_22]: So I've played a bunch of those.

18:14.548 --> 18:15.889
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't remember the watermelon eating game.

18:16.569 --> 18:18.029
[SPEAKER_22]: The intro is cracked out.

18:19.189 --> 18:21.730
[SPEAKER_22]: That is one of the queerest movies I've ever seen.

18:21.790 --> 18:22.670
[SPEAKER_22]: The how to play.

18:24.130 --> 18:25.451
[SPEAKER_22]: The how to play was great.

18:25.511 --> 18:26.451
[SPEAKER_22]: The how to play was like...

18:27.335 --> 18:30.336
[SPEAKER_22]: When the red dot comes, hit the note.

18:30.736 --> 18:31.696
[SPEAKER_22]: Boom, boom, ba-doom.

18:32.096 --> 18:32.916
[SPEAKER_22]: Boom, boom, ba-doom.

18:33.136 --> 18:34.356
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like this little song.

18:34.396 --> 18:35.756
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm talking about the intro, though.

18:36.177 --> 18:37.777
[SPEAKER_06]: The intro is so cracked out.

18:38.297 --> 18:40.637
[SPEAKER_06]: And it made me really have a craving for takoyaki.

18:42.358 --> 18:43.318
[SPEAKER_06]: Takoyaki's yummy.

18:43.438 --> 18:45.518
[SPEAKER_22]: Did it bring out your inner egg?

18:45.538 --> 18:48.119
[SPEAKER_22]: Where you're white on the outside, yellow on the inside?

18:50.679 --> 18:51.799
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want takoyaki.

18:51.819 --> 18:53.199
[SPEAKER_06]: Because takoyaki's yummy.

18:54.200 --> 18:56.120
[SPEAKER_16]: Don't they have takoyaki bell?

18:59.163 --> 19:04.407
[SPEAKER_16]: I still have fake psoriasis.

19:04.427 --> 19:04.787
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at my toe.

19:23.646 --> 19:24.546
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

19:40.251 --> 19:43.354
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, because I didn't start itching until I was here doing the show.

19:43.674 --> 19:44.875
[SPEAKER_22]: You're allergic to extifer.

19:44.895 --> 19:45.856
[SPEAKER_22]: That's basically what it is.

19:46.256 --> 19:48.838
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm allergic to gay... Okay.

19:48.858 --> 19:49.959
[SPEAKER_05]: You're allergic to gay people?

19:49.979 --> 19:51.260
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that what you're going to say?

19:51.280 --> 19:51.720
[SPEAKER_05]: Gay people?

19:52.761 --> 19:53.922
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you homophobic, ma'am?

19:53.962 --> 19:56.745
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm allergic to your carpet.

19:57.265 --> 19:59.066
[SPEAKER_22]: Your gay carpet.

19:59.086 --> 20:00.608
[SPEAKER_22]: You and I have something in common, honey.

20:01.348 --> 20:02.729
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't like that either.

20:03.290 --> 20:04.391
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't like carpet either.

20:04.411 --> 20:05.912
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay.

20:05.972 --> 20:06.172
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyway.

20:06.392 --> 20:06.873
[SPEAKER_06]: No, um...

20:09.073 --> 20:11.374
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I can't be allergic to gay because I caught that already.

20:11.974 --> 20:12.374
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, yeah.

20:12.734 --> 20:14.715
[SPEAKER_06]: At Spiggle five years ago.

20:14.835 --> 20:16.175
[SPEAKER_22]: How did you catch gay at Spiggle?

20:16.676 --> 20:19.596
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, okay, this is an old story.

20:20.497 --> 20:21.217
[SPEAKER_16]: Do tell.

20:22.157 --> 20:23.718
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember my big Pepsi bong.

20:24.898 --> 20:29.381
[SPEAKER_06]: I got this big bone-shaped Pepsi drink with the long straw.

20:29.401 --> 20:30.442
[SPEAKER_22]: Right, it was this drink.

20:30.482 --> 20:32.243
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know if they still sell it at Spiegel.

20:32.303 --> 20:32.884
[SPEAKER_22]: I highly doubt it.

20:32.904 --> 20:34.085
[SPEAKER_22]: Spiegel, by the way, Sunnyvale Golf Line.

20:34.285 --> 20:38.468
[SPEAKER_06]: And you had just got done playing an intense game of DDR.

20:39.108 --> 20:40.949
[SPEAKER_06]: So I said, here, do you want something to drink?

20:41.009 --> 20:42.230
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have any diseases.

20:42.631 --> 20:46.914
[SPEAKER_06]: And you say, okay, and take this big old drink, and I take it back, and I take my drink, and you go, I have gay.

20:46.934 --> 20:49.736
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, oh my god, suddenly I want Irene.

20:49.756 --> 20:50.156
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean...

20:52.762 --> 20:53.222
[SPEAKER_22]: I remember that.

20:53.242 --> 20:53.983
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, I remember that now.

20:54.083 --> 20:55.444
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that was an old story.

20:56.365 --> 20:56.665
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

20:57.406 --> 21:05.412
[SPEAKER_06]: But it turned out, well, my doctor, after two weeks of all these other treatments and I don't get better, we decide it's not viral.

21:05.873 --> 21:09.095
[SPEAKER_06]: So he puts me on amoxicillin, which I've never reacted to before.

21:09.115 --> 21:11.417
[SPEAKER_06]: I called my mom to make sure before I started taking it.

21:11.437 --> 21:13.078
[SPEAKER_06]: Mom, do you have any reactions to amoxicillin?

21:13.539 --> 21:14.640
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's just penicillin.

21:15.040 --> 21:18.503
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's in the same family, but some people don't have reactions to one that they do to the other.

21:18.923 --> 21:20.164
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm like, okay, so I take it.

21:20.264 --> 21:20.685
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm fine.

21:20.725 --> 21:21.886
[SPEAKER_06]: I finish it up last week.

21:22.506 --> 21:26.810
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, Sunday, during the middle of the show, I start itch, itch, itch, itch.

21:27.290 --> 21:28.051
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think anything of it.

21:28.071 --> 21:30.493
[SPEAKER_06]: Monday, I'm a little itchy, you know, just a little bit itcher.

21:30.513 --> 21:36.658
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I go to spin, which, of course, the worst thing you can do when you are having a rash is to exercise, because you are not supposed to be warm.

21:36.898 --> 21:40.141
[SPEAKER_22]: Spin, by the way, is a class at the gym where you ride a bike a lot.

21:40.641 --> 21:40.981
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

21:41.302 --> 21:41.662
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

21:42.182 --> 21:43.683
[SPEAKER_06]: In different and exciting positions.

21:43.804 --> 21:46.025
[SPEAKER_22]: But the bike does not spin around, contrary to popular belief.

21:46.045 --> 21:50.229
[SPEAKER_20]: Before that, I thought it was just, you know, what little kids do where they, you know, get up and spin, kind of...

21:50.809 --> 21:53.270
[SPEAKER_22]: That was the best thing on the playground.

21:53.550 --> 21:59.813
[SPEAKER_22]: You could spin the little merry-go-round, put your friends on it, and then you'd get five people to spin that thing as fast as you can.

21:59.993 --> 22:00.954
[SPEAKER_06]: And launch them into orbit.

22:00.994 --> 22:02.474
[SPEAKER_22]: Launch them into orbit.

22:02.514 --> 22:03.895
[SPEAKER_22]: Everybody gets so dizzy they throw up.

22:04.075 --> 22:04.435
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what?

22:04.455 --> 22:05.216
[SPEAKER_22]: That's still fun.

22:06.596 --> 22:08.357
[SPEAKER_22]: We need to do Orange Lounge Radio live at the park.

22:09.498 --> 22:11.178
[SPEAKER_22]: We need to do one of our podcasts at the park.

22:11.198 --> 22:12.919
[SPEAKER_22]: That would be awesome.

22:12.939 --> 22:13.679
[SPEAKER_22]: On the merry-go-round.

22:14.280 --> 22:19.142
[SPEAKER_06]: As I was saying, Tuesday I have red welts all over my body.

22:19.895 --> 22:21.177
[SPEAKER_06]: I am itching and miserable.

22:21.918 --> 22:22.519
[SPEAKER_06]: Wednesday.

22:22.980 --> 22:25.563
[SPEAKER_06]: I call the doctor in the morning and go ahead and schedule my appointment.

22:26.404 --> 22:29.268
[SPEAKER_06]: And as the day develops, my throat starts closing up.

22:29.348 --> 22:30.630
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm having trouble breathing.

22:31.552 --> 22:33.254
[SPEAKER_06]: I had stomach cramps so bad.

22:33.274 --> 22:35.838
[SPEAKER_22]: You definitely didn't catch gay because your throat wouldn't be closing up.

22:39.102 --> 22:57.348
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, as I was saying, I went to eat at the deli that I normally do behind my work and as I was walking back, my stomach cramps were so bad that I would have to stop because I could not walk because it hurt to put the pressure on my stomach from, you know, the motion of walking.

22:57.928 --> 22:58.888
[SPEAKER_06]: So I went to the doctor.

23:01.189 --> 23:02.089
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is Drug Chat with Dark Sakura.

23:25.056 --> 23:34.623
[SPEAKER_06]: and then one of my co-workers who has issues with eczema let me use her prescription for this ointment that made the itch go away.

23:35.604 --> 23:37.545
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, I once had an allergic reaction to amoxicillin.

23:37.565 --> 23:39.687
[SPEAKER_22]: It was the first time I was ever on penicillin of any type.

23:39.707 --> 23:42.429
[SPEAKER_22]: I was probably like 12 years old and I don't even remember why I was on amoxicillin.

23:42.629 --> 23:43.870
[SPEAKER_22]: Why do they put people on amoxicillin?

23:43.910 --> 23:45.912
[SPEAKER_22]: Because they have sinus infections or something?

23:45.932 --> 23:47.393
[SPEAKER_22]: It's an antibiotic.

23:47.433 --> 23:47.993
[SPEAKER_22]: I love that stuff.

23:48.013 --> 23:48.654
[SPEAKER_22]: It tastes so good.

23:48.874 --> 23:50.215
[SPEAKER_22]: That is gross.

23:50.235 --> 23:50.335
Ew.

23:50.655 --> 23:51.716
[SPEAKER_22]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

24:08.995 --> 24:09.795
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't even know how to say it.

24:09.815 --> 24:10.335
[SPEAKER_06]: You know how bad it was?

24:10.355 --> 24:14.736
[SPEAKER_06]: At the club, I went in and sat on these couches, and it's under a black light.

24:15.756 --> 24:23.838
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm so very pale that all the places where I was broken out look like big black spots.

24:24.118 --> 24:24.638
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh my God.

24:24.658 --> 24:26.898
[SPEAKER_06]: Because my skin normally glows when I go in the club.

24:27.018 --> 24:28.999
[SPEAKER_20]: To which they went, oh no, she's infected.

24:30.579 --> 24:33.420
[SPEAKER_06]: Someone mentioned that my neck looked like it had a continent on it.

24:33.640 --> 24:34.680
[SPEAKER_16]: Did it say you had the SARS?

24:35.686 --> 24:37.007
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it was SARS.

24:37.928 --> 24:39.729
[SPEAKER_22]: So besides Diseaseful, how was your week?

24:41.070 --> 24:41.971
[SPEAKER_06]: I played lots of games.

24:43.873 --> 24:44.173
[SPEAKER_22]: Like what?

24:44.713 --> 24:46.875
[SPEAKER_06]: I finally opened up my copy of Katamari.

24:47.435 --> 24:49.317
[SPEAKER_22]: Yay, so we can say the K word again.

24:49.377 --> 24:50.198
[SPEAKER_06]: We can say the K word again.

24:50.278 --> 24:50.938
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright, good to hear.

24:51.939 --> 25:00.366
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I played some World of Warcraft and thought about asking Dan to buy me DDR and then I thought no.

25:00.766 --> 25:02.988
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, I realized why I can't ever play World of Warcraft.

25:03.919 --> 25:04.079
[SPEAKER_06]: Why?

25:04.299 --> 25:11.282
[SPEAKER_22]: Because everybody, like a lot of people I know play World of Warcraft and everybody's trying to get me to sign up and go to their server.

25:11.622 --> 25:14.783
[SPEAKER_22]: The problem is that everybody is on a different server.

25:15.184 --> 25:20.286
[SPEAKER_22]: So if I sign up for that game, I'm going to have to pick a server to go to and I'm going to piss people off.

25:20.446 --> 25:21.286
[SPEAKER_06]: No, not necessarily.

25:22.586 --> 25:31.930
[SPEAKER_06]: And extra for having this conversation the other day when I was showing in World of Warcraft, you can have as many characters as you want on as many servers as you want to and not get charged for it.

25:31.990 --> 25:33.551
[SPEAKER_06]: But I don't like the whole...

25:33.931 --> 25:35.592
[SPEAKER_22]: I was in an hour of gameplay, I made level 6.

25:35.672 --> 25:37.654
[SPEAKER_22]: You can't do that on Final Fantasy XI, I'm sorry.

25:37.674 --> 25:38.755
[SPEAKER_22]: Not in an hour of gameplay.

25:55.908 --> 25:59.711
[SPEAKER_06]: Unless you have people freaking tanking for you or something, but by yourself.

25:59.731 --> 26:01.553
[SPEAKER_22]: There's ways, but not when you first play.

26:01.813 --> 26:05.636
[SPEAKER_06]: You can run around and not kill anything and at least go up two levels.

26:06.727 --> 26:07.407
[SPEAKER_22]: On World of Warcraft?

26:07.547 --> 26:08.328
[SPEAKER_06]: On World of Warcraft.

26:08.908 --> 26:11.269
[SPEAKER_06]: You find a lake, you get 50 experience points.

26:11.309 --> 26:13.310
[SPEAKER_06]: You find a town, you get 100 experience points.

26:13.630 --> 26:15.871
[SPEAKER_06]: You meet X person, you get 100 experience points.

26:15.891 --> 26:16.811
[SPEAKER_06]: That's retarded.

26:17.231 --> 26:18.112
[SPEAKER_06]: You finish a quest, you get 50.

26:18.252 --> 26:21.933
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, it is not for the simple reason it is an RPG.

26:22.053 --> 26:29.716
[SPEAKER_06]: If you do tabletop RPG, if you do live action RPG, you get experience for doing things and participating in the game.

26:30.216 --> 26:33.418
[SPEAKER_06]: Not for just going around doing freaking hack and slash, which I think is ridiculous.

26:33.858 --> 26:35.058
[SPEAKER_22]: You discover you have arms.

26:35.419 --> 26:36.319
[SPEAKER_22]: Two experience.

26:37.645 --> 26:40.006
[SPEAKER_22]: You discovered the secret to love making.

26:41.146 --> 26:42.327
[SPEAKER_22]: You just hit puberty!

26:42.507 --> 26:43.287
[SPEAKER_22]: Ten experience!

26:43.587 --> 26:45.148
[SPEAKER_22]: You growed your first pubes.

26:45.288 --> 26:46.108
[SPEAKER_22]: Five experience.

26:46.668 --> 26:52.830
[SPEAKER_06]: But I like that in the fact that experience is defined by what you do.

26:53.570 --> 26:54.731
[SPEAKER_06]: Not just what you kill.

26:55.774 --> 26:56.475
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, Jamie.

26:57.175 --> 26:57.656
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, hi.

26:57.756 --> 26:58.776
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, everybody.

26:58.796 --> 27:00.798
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you take a break from Tycho long enough to say hello?

27:00.818 --> 27:01.098
[SPEAKER_04]: I did.

27:01.278 --> 27:01.558
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

27:01.679 --> 27:03.000
[SPEAKER_04]: Yo, everyone.

27:03.520 --> 27:04.721
[SPEAKER_04]: Are your hands bruised yet?

27:05.562 --> 27:06.702
[SPEAKER_04]: No, my hands aren't bruised yet.

27:07.383 --> 27:12.287
[SPEAKER_04]: What I was going to tell you to say is what happens when you die on World of Warcraft.

27:12.447 --> 27:14.088
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah, you have to go back and find your body.

27:14.729 --> 27:15.309
[SPEAKER_22]: You're a ghost.

27:15.629 --> 27:16.770
[SPEAKER_22]: I do remember seeing that, yeah.

27:16.990 --> 27:19.132
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty cool, because I haven't died yet, because I'm awesome.

27:21.964 --> 27:22.344
[SPEAKER_22]: DarkSakura.com

27:42.775 --> 27:46.841
[SPEAKER_22]: Got Pizza x4, I think that's a reference to the slash pizza command in EverQuest.

27:47.322 --> 27:49.606
[SPEAKER_22]: You randomly die, 6 experience.

27:50.247 --> 27:51.508
[SPEAKER_22]: You learn what IRC is.

27:52.609 --> 27:53.350
[SPEAKER_22]: Ah, you guys are weird.

27:53.450 --> 27:54.130
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright, um, anything else?

27:54.531 --> 28:03.819
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, if you think about it, though, you know, in real life, you know, the different things you do add to your experience and teach you along the way, and you level over here.

28:03.839 --> 28:06.581
[SPEAKER_22]: Sometimes you de-level when you find things out in real life.

28:07.082 --> 28:07.982
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, ah!

28:08.022 --> 28:09.243
[SPEAKER_06]: This has traumatized me!

28:09.304 --> 28:10.505
[SPEAKER_06]: Minus 50 experience!

28:10.545 --> 28:12.726
[SPEAKER_22]: Your boyfriend's been fucking around on your back!

28:12.907 --> 28:19.072
[SPEAKER_22]: I did like the fact how they have a quest where you get a chicken, like, pet to follow you around, and the chicken pet's easily killed.

28:19.557 --> 28:23.119
[SPEAKER_22]: So it's like a very complex quest for a really useless item.

28:23.980 --> 28:31.704
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, the last quest series of quests that I've been doing, and I'm on the last leg of this series, are the go to this fountain and fill this bottle and bring it back.

28:32.665 --> 28:43.031
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've done this with like five different locations, and now I'm going to the big town to give my bottle to somebody, and I'm like kind of underleveled for where I am because I've just been running quests.

28:43.413 --> 28:53.624
[SPEAKER_22]: I think it would be cooler in World of Warcraft if the chicken that followed you, you could start slashing it like over and over and then all of a sudden all the chickens start attacking you.

28:53.905 --> 28:58.750
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it says you got a cock in your ear, 50 experience points, and you got your brains fucked out.

29:00.592 --> 29:01.393
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Extover.

29:01.613 --> 29:03.896
[SPEAKER_06]: I like playing the zombies though because you can eat people.

29:05.552 --> 29:09.115
[SPEAKER_06]: If you play the undead, you can regain energy by feeding on corpses.

29:09.295 --> 29:10.316
[SPEAKER_06]: That's lovely.

29:10.416 --> 29:12.678
[SPEAKER_22]: So what happens if somebody eats your corpse before you find it?

29:13.059 --> 29:14.480
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's eating other corpses.

29:14.540 --> 29:15.521
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't tried doing it yet.

29:16.142 --> 29:18.504
[SPEAKER_06]: The other good thing about it is that you regenerate XP.

29:19.885 --> 29:23.848
[SPEAKER_06]: And you regenerate your MP or energy if you're one of the undead.

29:23.868 --> 29:27.111
[SPEAKER_06]: You got sued by Konami.

29:27.352 --> 29:27.892
[SPEAKER_22]: That's great.

29:27.912 --> 29:29.173
[SPEAKER_22]: You got sued by Konami.

29:29.233 --> 29:29.774
[SPEAKER_22]: Minus 999 experience.

29:32.052 --> 29:37.696
[SPEAKER_06]: Wouldn't it be minus 573 experience points?

29:37.877 --> 29:46.764
[SPEAKER_22]: As I was saying, without saying anything, all I have to say is that this week, something, the most hilarious thing is about to happen.

29:47.164 --> 29:48.566
[SPEAKER_22]: I can't even put it into words.

29:50.267 --> 29:52.729
[SPEAKER_22]: Next week, you guys, is it going to be done by next Sunday?

29:52.849 --> 29:53.550
[SPEAKER_22]: Or do we have to wait two weeks?

29:53.570 --> 29:54.110
[SPEAKER_22]: It's Thursday.

29:54.691 --> 29:55.832
[SPEAKER_22]: So is it going to be done by next Sunday?

29:57.418 --> 29:58.358
[SPEAKER_22]: Stay tuned to our website.

29:58.378 --> 29:59.779
[SPEAKER_22]: We've got big news coming up.

29:59.899 --> 30:02.380
[SPEAKER_22]: And next Sunday, we're going to have a field day.

30:02.400 --> 30:03.200
[SPEAKER_22]: That's all I have to say.

30:03.240 --> 30:10.063
[SPEAKER_06]: I just find that the other thing that was occurring to me that I also find hilarious about that is just the number of things I'm going to have on display.

30:10.143 --> 30:10.683
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, I know.

30:10.723 --> 30:11.544
[SPEAKER_06]: When said person.

30:11.604 --> 30:11.844
[SPEAKER_22]: I know.

30:12.024 --> 30:12.624
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyway, anyway.

30:13.184 --> 30:14.305
[SPEAKER_06]: No more about that.

30:14.405 --> 30:14.725
[SPEAKER_06]: No more.

30:14.745 --> 30:15.746
[SPEAKER_22]: There's your teaser.

30:15.766 --> 30:16.126
[SPEAKER_06]: I dread.

30:17.066 --> 30:18.647
[SPEAKER_22]: I dread what's going to come of this.

30:18.747 --> 30:19.627
[SPEAKER_22]: I'll be bringing it out.

30:19.647 --> 30:20.107
[SPEAKER_06]: I dread.

30:20.447 --> 30:20.668
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

30:20.728 --> 30:22.008
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyway, our listeners are so lost.

30:22.068 --> 30:22.288
[SPEAKER_22]: I know.

30:22.328 --> 30:23.849
[SPEAKER_22]: What the fuck are they talking about?

30:25.603 --> 30:28.765
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to be putting out my popping music controller.

30:30.786 --> 30:34.788
[SPEAKER_22]: If the listeners are going to accuse us of jumping the shark ever, next week will be it.

30:35.088 --> 30:35.309
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh yeah.

30:35.329 --> 30:36.629
[SPEAKER_22]: I swear to God, next week will be it.

30:36.669 --> 30:39.211
[SPEAKER_06]: I even find this hilarious, they asked for it.

30:40.071 --> 30:42.633
[SPEAKER_22]: You should put other like, Bomani and stuff.

30:42.913 --> 30:43.773
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyway, moving on.

30:44.393 --> 30:45.034
[SPEAKER_22]: We'll be around.

30:45.274 --> 30:46.395
[SPEAKER_22]: Loki, how was your week, how was your day?

30:46.755 --> 30:47.835
[SPEAKER_22]: My week was okay.

30:49.426 --> 30:50.727
[SPEAKER_22]: I didn't play that many games.

30:50.807 --> 30:53.949
[SPEAKER_22]: I played Burnout and more Burnout and more Burnout.

30:56.010 --> 31:02.374
[SPEAKER_22]: So anyways, my week started off with I had to go to Jury Duty.

31:03.315 --> 31:05.216
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh my god, you went to Jury Duty this week.

31:05.236 --> 31:05.657
[SPEAKER_22]: That's right.

31:05.837 --> 31:06.077
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

31:06.117 --> 31:06.637
[SPEAKER_22]: How'd that go?

31:06.977 --> 31:07.738
[SPEAKER_22]: I didn't get called.

31:07.778 --> 31:12.621
[SPEAKER_22]: Instead, I had to watch four movies because they played movies while we were waiting.

31:12.721 --> 31:13.842
[SPEAKER_22]: So I got to watch...

31:14.242 --> 31:25.844
[SPEAKER_22]: Advent Children again on my PSP, then I watched episode 4 of Star Wars, and then finally The Pacifier, followed by While You Were Sleeping.

31:27.113 --> 31:27.553
[SPEAKER_22]: XBOX 360 Games

31:47.927 --> 31:51.008
[SPEAKER_03]: You're supposed to let me take the doggies.

31:51.328 --> 31:51.648
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, well.

31:53.448 --> 31:55.209
[SPEAKER_22]: So then, wow, what a nice guy.

31:55.969 --> 31:58.930
[SPEAKER_22]: So I pre-ordered Gun and Project Gotham Racing 3.

31:58.970 --> 32:00.550
[SPEAKER_22]: That's going to be awesome.

32:01.510 --> 32:03.511
[SPEAKER_22]: And what else did I do this week?

32:03.531 --> 32:04.491
[SPEAKER_22]: Eh, not too much.

32:04.511 --> 32:13.693
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm supposed to be getting stylish attire for the... Because I'm going to Lake Tahoe this week to actually...

32:14.392 --> 32:32.158
[SPEAKER_22]: for our 25th anniversary party for our company, and I have to wear stylist attire, so I have pinstripe pants, and I have to buy a shirt for it, I'm gonna look pimp, but anyways, what else, oh, that's pretty much it, you know, just lots of work stuff, and yeah.

32:33.530 --> 32:34.111
[SPEAKER_22]: Fun stuff like that.

32:59.654 --> 33:00.034
[SPEAKER_22]: They don't.

33:00.454 --> 33:00.895
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, they do.

33:01.295 --> 33:03.336
[SPEAKER_22]: They turned the supersize into large.

33:03.596 --> 33:05.897
[SPEAKER_22]: No, large is not as big as supersize.

33:05.917 --> 33:09.278
[SPEAKER_22]: Trust me, I am missing out on potential drink and fries.

33:09.858 --> 33:16.521
[SPEAKER_22]: And, you know, they finally switched the cups back to these nice plastic ones that don't fucking blow up when I put them in my cup holder.

33:16.841 --> 33:18.222
[SPEAKER_22]: Because that was really fun.

33:19.222 --> 33:21.483
[SPEAKER_22]: But at least, you know, they have that fixed now.

33:21.903 --> 33:28.386
[SPEAKER_22]: And what I have to say is now this new Monopoly game you play online as well as collect the stupid pieces.

33:28.406 --> 33:29.106
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, that's what I heard.

33:29.349 --> 33:40.016
[SPEAKER_22]: So I've been playing it online and so far I've won three times the stupid prints at this fish something or other, I don't know, some stupid online photo place.

33:40.437 --> 33:42.458
[SPEAKER_22]: So now I can get like 75 exposures.

33:42.678 --> 33:44.980
[SPEAKER_22]: That's great, except I don't take pictures of anything.

33:46.040 --> 33:51.224
[SPEAKER_22]: You should take like pornographic pictures of something, or I don't know, like really raunchy photos.

33:51.384 --> 33:54.666
[SPEAKER_22]: Like take pictures of you and Ellie having sex or something and see if they'll develop it.

33:54.886 --> 33:55.907
[SPEAKER_22]: It won't develop that crap.

33:56.127 --> 33:56.668
[SPEAKER_22]: You don't know that.

33:57.068 --> 33:57.328
[SPEAKER_00]: Try it.

33:57.368 --> 33:57.788
[SPEAKER_22]: You know that.

34:00.433 --> 34:01.234
[SPEAKER_22]: It'll make a statement.

34:02.675 --> 34:03.315
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, whatever.

34:03.375 --> 34:03.735
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyways.

34:05.136 --> 34:06.477
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm just trying to win something else.

34:07.357 --> 34:08.959
[SPEAKER_22]: But I do like these Best Buy bucks.

34:09.259 --> 34:12.221
[SPEAKER_22]: That's the only thing I really play it for, is these Best Buy bucks.

34:12.761 --> 34:15.282
[SPEAKER_22]: Because I got $4 from two different fries.

34:15.463 --> 34:18.184
[SPEAKER_22]: But why didn't you just the $4 that you would have spent on food?

34:19.145 --> 34:19.905
[SPEAKER_22]: I didn't spend it on food.

34:20.025 --> 34:24.128
[SPEAKER_22]: I wanted fries, but I also got fries and free money.

34:24.808 --> 34:25.909
[SPEAKER_22]: Hey, I like free money.

34:25.929 --> 34:26.550
[SPEAKER_22]: Whatever.

34:26.730 --> 34:27.070
[SPEAKER_22]: Whatever.

34:28.804 --> 34:32.405
[SPEAKER_22]: My week and my day was pretty okay.

34:32.465 --> 34:34.846
[SPEAKER_22]: Yesterday I went to Fry's, which is, you know, nerd heaven.

34:34.906 --> 34:37.707
[SPEAKER_22]: Fry's is this giant electronic store here on the West Coast.

34:37.747 --> 34:41.388
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't think they have it on the East, or it's slowly going out there or something.

34:41.668 --> 34:43.269
[SPEAKER_22]: It's also Outpost.com online.

34:43.689 --> 34:48.050
[SPEAKER_22]: And so I went to Fry's and I finally bought myself a gaming router, a wireless gaming router.

34:48.510 --> 34:52.672
[SPEAKER_22]: And what that will allow me to do is that, since Bug was good enough to give me a wireless...

34:53.832 --> 34:54.592
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you for watching!

35:12.717 --> 35:26.686
[SPEAKER_22]: But anyway, without having to run a cord to the living room, because the Xbox and PlayStation are out in the living room, we have the routers in here for the computers, so I don't have a cable long enough, so I had to get a wireless gaming router, basically.

35:26.726 --> 35:29.908
[SPEAKER_22]: It's specifically something you use to plug your Xbox and PlayStation into.

35:30.328 --> 35:34.811
[SPEAKER_22]: So I bought one of those, and it's nice to be back on Xbox Live and getting killed at Halo.

35:35.745 --> 35:36.145
[SPEAKER_22]: What's that?

35:36.165 --> 35:36.386
[SPEAKER_22]: What's that?

35:57.425 --> 35:59.167
[SPEAKER_22]: I need to play some poppin' music stuff next break.

36:00.728 --> 36:04.271
[SPEAKER_22]: I have poppin' music 13 stuff I never got to in a previous week, I don't think, but anyway.

36:04.291 --> 36:06.433
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you for reminding me.

36:07.013 --> 36:07.934
[SPEAKER_22]: What else did I do this week?

36:08.494 --> 36:09.175
[SPEAKER_22]: Not a whole lot.

36:09.195 --> 36:16.521
[SPEAKER_22]: I guess I started playing Extreme 2 online today, because since I got the router last night, I was playing Extreme 2 online a little bit today.

36:18.042 --> 36:18.843
[SPEAKER_22]: It's interesting.

36:18.863 --> 36:19.564
[SPEAKER_22]: It

36:21.772 --> 36:22.413
[SPEAKER_22]: Thanks for watching!

36:40.012 --> 36:52.297
[SPEAKER_22]: online thing where you can actually choose your opponent and choose your song, which is kind of interesting, but I wonder if that has to do with the fact that Xbox Live is just probably better set up for that kind of thing than the free PlayStation things.

36:52.417 --> 36:53.158
[SPEAKER_22]: I have no idea.

36:53.618 --> 37:01.921
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't program these games, so I don't know, but the online one, if you guys have played it, you know that you don't choose your opponent, you just search for an opponent, and you don't get to choose your song.

37:01.961 --> 37:05.763
[SPEAKER_22]: You only get to choose light, standard, heavy, or any.

37:06.723 --> 37:07.784
[SPEAKER_22]: So, it's interesting.

37:08.975 --> 37:35.270
[SPEAKER_22]: and I've played some top ranked players in the time that I've been on there and what's very interesting about doing that is that well, A, they've all really, really beat me but the other interesting thing is that it's randomly picking your song I've played probably like 15 to 18 matches online total which really isn't a lot, that's probably about less than an hour of game time I've played like 15 to 18 matches online Paranoia Survivor Max Heavy has come up three or four times at least

37:36.030 --> 37:38.272
[SPEAKER_22]: And there's supposed to be like 70 freaking songs in this game.

37:38.332 --> 37:39.452
[SPEAKER_22]: It's picking songs at random.

37:39.793 --> 37:46.698
[SPEAKER_22]: I got Paranoia Survivor Max three or four times out of, like, one out of every three matches was Paranoia Survivor Max.

37:46.718 --> 37:47.338
[SPEAKER_22]: That's crap.

37:48.379 --> 37:48.939
[SPEAKER_22]: That's such crap.

37:49.139 --> 37:51.481
[SPEAKER_22]: Because Paranoia Survivor Max has bullshit steps.

37:51.821 --> 37:55.744
[SPEAKER_22]: If I want to play a song with bullshit steps, I'll go play in the groove, okay?

37:58.174 --> 37:59.315
[SPEAKER_22]: So that's my experience with online.

37:59.455 --> 38:00.235
[SPEAKER_22]: Otherwise, it's okay.

38:00.375 --> 38:01.396
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, I did the ranking thing.

38:01.696 --> 38:02.676
[SPEAKER_22]: It's fun, I guess.

38:03.117 --> 38:22.287
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, playing matches is okay, except you can't really talk to the person you're playing, so you can only imagine what their reaction is like, because I know I was playing one kid, and he was doing really well, and then all of a sudden, like, I think he got pissed off that he got a good or something, because all of a sudden you just see boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, and all these, you know, misses going up his side of the screen, so it's just kind of funny.

38:22.487 --> 38:24.808
[SPEAKER_22]: But you can't really hear him like you can on Xbox, so...

38:25.928 --> 38:26.548
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, darn.

38:26.849 --> 38:27.129
[SPEAKER_22]: I know.

38:27.409 --> 38:29.890
[SPEAKER_22]: Then again, kids say really stupid shit on Xbox.

38:30.270 --> 38:31.130
[SPEAKER_22]: Not so much DDR.

38:31.150 --> 38:46.015
[SPEAKER_22]: The DDR rooms are rather decent compared to, like, Halo 2 or Doom 3, playing those online, and you got all those kids like, I'm gonna beat you up, I'm gonna cut you, I'm gonna shoot you, I do what I want!

38:46.455 --> 38:47.076
[SPEAKER_22]: Exactly.

38:47.536 --> 38:49.376
[SPEAKER_03]: My mom ain't home right now, I got a pony.

38:56.545 --> 38:56.845
[SPEAKER_22]: All right.

38:57.405 --> 38:58.825
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyway, so that's that.

38:59.845 --> 39:00.465
[SPEAKER_22]: Bogd, how was your week?

39:00.485 --> 39:00.886
[SPEAKER_22]: How was your day?

39:02.746 --> 39:04.926
[SPEAKER_16]: I sold all my DS stuff yesterday and picked up a PSP.

39:06.947 --> 39:09.848
[SPEAKER_16]: And just because, what attracted you to PSP?

39:10.248 --> 39:10.928
[SPEAKER_16]: The sound worked.

39:12.328 --> 39:13.368
[SPEAKER_16]: My DS's sound was dead.

39:13.388 --> 39:15.869
[SPEAKER_16]: They didn't ask me when I sold it if it worked or not.

39:18.038 --> 39:21.861
[SPEAKER_06]: That's because anything that doesn't fully function gets sent back for refurbishment.

39:22.441 --> 39:22.581
[SPEAKER_16]: Ah.

39:23.222 --> 39:28.465
[SPEAKER_06]: Nope, he didn't say anything about it, just... It's because they test them later, and if they don't work, they send it back to be refurbed.

39:28.765 --> 39:29.026
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, good.

39:29.526 --> 39:36.291
[SPEAKER_16]: I still got my 55 bucks for that, and as it turned out, all my stuff was worth 150 bucks, and this is clear back to, like, Pokemon Silver.

39:36.831 --> 39:37.091
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.

39:37.712 --> 39:38.692
[SPEAKER_16]: All my Game Boy stuff.

39:39.273 --> 39:40.654
[SPEAKER_16]: And, uh, Nintendogs.

39:41.074 --> 39:41.214
[SPEAKER_16]: Exactly.

39:42.042 --> 39:45.843
[SPEAKER_16]: I didn't play it often enough, but PSP I can at least do stuff other than play games on.

39:46.023 --> 39:50.545
[SPEAKER_22]: I think I'm kind of done with Nintendogs, which is kind of sad, because I really, really love that game.

39:50.625 --> 39:52.866
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, and I remember saying it was like... It's over far too quick.

39:53.266 --> 40:00.989
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, it doesn't hold my interest long enough, and maybe I'm just trying to get more of a game out of it, and it's really not supposed to be that.

40:02.089 --> 40:02.409
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know.

40:02.469 --> 40:03.930
[SPEAKER_22]: I hated that I have to play it.

40:04.699 --> 40:07.621
[SPEAKER_22]: It's just like, I'm like, oh, goddammit, I gotta feed the dog again.

40:07.681 --> 40:12.164
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, that's not too surprising, because that's how Tamagotchis are, and that's how, you know, other virtual pets... I can't find my PS.

40:12.824 --> 40:13.344
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, shit.

40:13.504 --> 40:15.225
[SPEAKER_06]: I left it in my locked drawer at work.

40:15.626 --> 40:16.366
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I take it to work.

40:16.806 --> 40:17.487
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, maybe that's it.

40:18.067 --> 40:21.229
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe, but my puppies are gonna be pissing all over my tatami house.

40:22.070 --> 40:24.571
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, they don't pee on the floor, like they do in, like, Sims 2 and stuff.

40:24.771 --> 40:25.031
[SPEAKER_06]: Mm-hmm.

40:25.392 --> 40:25.532
[SPEAKER_22]: No.

40:26.412 --> 40:26.632
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyway.

40:28.053 --> 40:28.553
[SPEAKER_22]: So, anything else?

40:29.974 --> 40:32.616
[SPEAKER_16]: Went down to the Bay Area and ran into random people that we know.

40:33.586 --> 40:38.209
[SPEAKER_16]: I went to Dave & Buster's for dinner, and as I was leaving, I was like, wow, that really looks like... Holy crap, it is!

40:38.909 --> 40:43.292
[SPEAKER_16]: And there's a large... They took out two of the driving games right next to the entrance.

40:43.972 --> 40:44.292
[SPEAKER_16]: What was it?

40:44.492 --> 40:46.534
[SPEAKER_16]: The Namco... Whatever the hell it was.

40:47.114 --> 40:47.914
[SPEAKER_16]: And the Tokyo Cop.

40:48.114 --> 40:48.775
[SPEAKER_06]: Maximum Tune?

40:49.475 --> 40:50.376
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, Maximum Tune.

40:50.396 --> 40:51.236
[SPEAKER_16]: I like Tokyo Cop.

40:51.576 --> 40:53.037
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not because we got Maximum Tune!

40:53.598 --> 40:54.678
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, they took out Maximum Tune.

40:54.718 --> 40:55.479
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not in there anymore.

40:55.619 --> 40:56.139
[SPEAKER_16]: Bastards.

40:56.419 --> 40:59.661
[SPEAKER_16]: But those two are gone, and there's now a giant six-player trivia game.

41:00.299 --> 41:01.740
[SPEAKER_16]: 6-player trivia game?

41:01.760 --> 41:02.720
[SPEAKER_16]: 6-player trivia game.

41:02.740 --> 41:05.401
[SPEAKER_16]: You have three buttons, A, B, and C. You just press the button of the answer.

41:05.642 --> 41:06.642
[SPEAKER_22]: That sounds kind of interesting.

41:06.662 --> 41:07.182
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a ticket game.

41:07.242 --> 41:08.743
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, I figured, yeah.

41:08.943 --> 41:17.788
[SPEAKER_16]: So, as I walk up, our other intrepid listener had a pile of tickets running around her feet several times, as per usual.

41:18.228 --> 41:18.728
[SPEAKER_16]: That's great.

41:18.888 --> 41:21.449
[SPEAKER_16]: I think she came up, like, six tickets.

41:21.469 --> 41:22.710
[SPEAKER_16]: She bought an Xbox.

41:23.010 --> 41:23.710
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, she saved it for me.

41:23.730 --> 41:24.731
[SPEAKER_16]: This is Shark's Girl, by the way.

41:24.771 --> 41:26.952
[SPEAKER_22]: She's been on the show before, so some of our listeners might know her.

41:26.972 --> 41:27.952
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know what she went by on here.

41:27.992 --> 41:28.513
[SPEAKER_16]: Shark's Girl.

41:28.773 --> 41:28.993
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

41:29.945 --> 41:31.306
[SPEAKER_16]: She now has $50,000 in one.

41:31.686 --> 41:35.307
[SPEAKER_16]: She came up six short, so I gave her three tickets to put her over $50,000.

41:36.528 --> 41:37.548
[SPEAKER_16]: What's she buying now?

41:37.728 --> 41:37.948
[SPEAKER_16]: PS3.

41:41.970 --> 41:42.350
[SPEAKER_22]: Wow.

41:42.790 --> 41:43.250
[SPEAKER_22]: That's crazy.

41:43.810 --> 41:49.873
[SPEAKER_16]: But that was really strange to just randomly... Run into people?

41:49.953 --> 41:50.933
[SPEAKER_16]: Randomly run into people.

41:51.633 --> 41:55.715
[SPEAKER_16]: And I was thinking about actually text messaging her and saying, Hey, are you up for Dave & Buster's tonight?

41:55.735 --> 41:55.815
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

41:57.113 --> 41:57.653
[SPEAKER_22]: She read your mind.

41:58.013 --> 41:58.534
[SPEAKER_16]: Apparently so.

41:58.614 --> 41:58.954
[SPEAKER_16]: Amazing.

41:59.994 --> 42:02.795
[SPEAKER_22]: I want to go check out the trivia game, although I am sad about Tokyo Cop.

42:03.375 --> 42:03.675
[SPEAKER_22]: Don't be.

42:04.396 --> 42:05.436
[SPEAKER_22]: I like Tokyo Cop.

42:06.056 --> 42:07.297
[SPEAKER_06]: Tokyo Cop was really awful.

42:08.597 --> 42:09.277
[SPEAKER_22]: You bastards.

42:09.477 --> 42:14.539
[SPEAKER_22]: If it's the same game I'm thinking of, it's like right there when you walk through the door.

42:14.659 --> 42:16.080
[SPEAKER_16]: I like Tokyo Cop.

42:16.700 --> 42:17.220
[SPEAKER_22]: Nobody else did.

42:17.460 --> 42:22.722
[SPEAKER_22]: You know what they need to get anywhere because they're releasing it over here is the Mario Kart arcade game.

42:23.342 --> 42:25.323
[SPEAKER_22]: Holy God do I want to play that so bad.

42:25.984 --> 42:27.184
[SPEAKER_16]: That's geared towards kids.

42:27.524 --> 42:27.785
No, it's not.

42:28.265 --> 42:29.125
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I don't care.

42:29.185 --> 42:30.125
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll kick the kids out.

42:31.145 --> 42:33.786
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, all they have to do is put something you can hold your beer in.

42:34.766 --> 42:35.447
[SPEAKER_16]: Exactly.

42:36.107 --> 42:38.608
[SPEAKER_22]: I'll tell you what, that F-Zero arcade game kicked ass.

42:38.628 --> 42:41.528
[SPEAKER_22]: The only problem with F-Zero arcade game is that there was like three tracks.

42:41.548 --> 42:42.309
[SPEAKER_22]: Four.

42:42.329 --> 42:43.369
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, like four tracks.

42:43.689 --> 42:45.069
[SPEAKER_22]: And F-Zero, fuck that.

42:45.409 --> 42:48.790
[SPEAKER_22]: That F-Zero arcade game could have been amazing if they put more tracks on it.

42:49.371 --> 42:50.471
[SPEAKER_22]: And like more to do.

42:50.491 --> 42:52.131
[SPEAKER_22]: I wasn't so damn excited.

42:52.151 --> 42:53.652
[SPEAKER_22]: But the F-Zero arcade game was awesome.

42:53.732 --> 42:54.172
[SPEAKER_22]: I liked it.

42:55.097 --> 43:01.281
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, the nice thing about going to Dave & Buster's for dinner and stuff, they had the $13.99, get a $10 card.

43:01.861 --> 43:05.803
[SPEAKER_16]: Now it's $14.99 all day, Monday through Thursday.

43:06.904 --> 43:12.027
[SPEAKER_22]: By the way, secret message from our chat room, Poland, Poland, Poland, yes.

43:14.062 --> 43:15.343
[SPEAKER_22]: There you go.

43:15.603 --> 43:16.223
[SPEAKER_22]: She's psychic.

43:16.243 --> 43:19.085
[SPEAKER_22]: Sharkskrill just hopped in chat and said Poland, Poland.

43:19.185 --> 43:20.246
[SPEAKER_16]: She's probably listening.

43:20.726 --> 43:22.207
[SPEAKER_22]: I think so.

43:22.607 --> 43:23.027
[SPEAKER_22]: She claims to.

43:23.147 --> 43:25.389
[SPEAKER_22]: Her boyfriend was in chat earlier, so I think they're both listening.

43:25.869 --> 43:26.409
[SPEAKER_16]: It looks that way.

43:26.669 --> 43:26.830
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

43:28.070 --> 43:28.431
[SPEAKER_16]: Poland.

43:28.811 --> 43:29.571
[SPEAKER_16]: Definitely Poland.

43:29.771 --> 43:31.552
[SPEAKER_22]: Is that like a trivia question thing or something?

43:31.572 --> 43:33.634
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, everyone else answered right because it was pretty obvious.

43:34.874 --> 43:36.415
[SPEAKER_16]: And, well, she didn't.

43:38.617 --> 43:39.197
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, anyway.

43:39.637 --> 43:40.858
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't even remember the whole question.

43:41.684 --> 43:42.544
[SPEAKER_16]: It was something about Poland.

43:42.985 --> 43:44.385
[SPEAKER_16]: No, it wasn't about Poland.

43:44.405 --> 43:46.367
[SPEAKER_16]: It was about somebody being from a certain country.

43:47.407 --> 43:50.929
[SPEAKER_16]: And one of the choices was Poland, but the right answer was something completely odd.

43:52.230 --> 43:53.711
[SPEAKER_22]: I want to try this game out sometime.

43:53.731 --> 43:55.431
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm going to have to go back to Dave & Buster's.

43:56.012 --> 43:57.533
[SPEAKER_22]: I wish they'd build one here.

43:57.713 --> 44:01.435
[SPEAKER_22]: I love the idea of a Chuck E. Cheese for adults where kids aren't allowed after a certain time.

44:01.775 --> 44:02.635
[SPEAKER_22]: That's like heaven to me.

44:03.196 --> 44:04.396
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think they should be allowed at all.

44:04.436 --> 44:06.598
[SPEAKER_22]: In heaven, I don't want children to be allowed after 11 o'clock.

44:09.329 --> 44:11.511
[SPEAKER_16]: If you could just beat them up and kick them out of the way.

44:11.891 --> 44:12.132
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

44:12.392 --> 44:15.535
[SPEAKER_16]: Kind of like how in Katamari, when you hold down the button and run, you can keep off the cousins out.

44:15.595 --> 44:15.995
[SPEAKER_16]: Exactly.

44:16.255 --> 44:18.017
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, that would be perfect for kids at midnight.

44:19.278 --> 44:23.122
[SPEAKER_16]: Because drunken rages are just like... Extifer, how was your week?

44:23.142 --> 44:23.722
[SPEAKER_04]: How was your day?

44:25.484 --> 44:28.967
[SPEAKER_04]: It was pretty much your usual week for me.

44:29.087 --> 44:31.850
[SPEAKER_04]: I went to work, you know...

44:33.683 --> 44:39.312
[SPEAKER_04]: Played music at home, showered, shaved, masturbated

44:40.447 --> 44:41.268
[SPEAKER_04]: More than a few times.

44:42.088 --> 44:48.071
[SPEAKER_04]: And also, you know, on Fridays, Fridays have officially been dubbed Firefly Fridays.

44:48.752 --> 44:53.995
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, Jamie and I, or DarkSakura and I, have... I prefer my name.

44:54.295 --> 45:03.240
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, Jamie and I went ahead and we went ahead and watched up to the end of the second disc of Firefly, which was great, good times.

45:03.700 --> 45:04.941
[SPEAKER_06]: The James Bond episode.

45:05.982 --> 45:07.683
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's pretty funny.

45:07.824 --> 45:08.624
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty funny stuff.

45:08.805 --> 45:09.666
[SPEAKER_04]: Still recommend the movie.

45:09.706 --> 45:10.847
[SPEAKER_06]: A hero called me.

45:12.208 --> 45:12.689
[SPEAKER_06]: That was great.

45:12.789 --> 45:14.411
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, sorry.

45:15.091 --> 45:18.956
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyhow, we went and saw, we saw that at our place.

45:18.976 --> 45:26.924
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we also went to Lyons where I got to explain why Pez candy is like the sheepskin condom of candy.

45:30.846 --> 45:31.886
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you want to know why?

45:32.066 --> 45:32.807
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

45:34.067 --> 45:35.327
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably not, but okay.

45:35.828 --> 45:40.249
[SPEAKER_04]: Because sheepskin condoms are like the classic that nobody really thinks about now.

45:41.409 --> 45:42.430
[SPEAKER_04]: And so are Pez candies.

45:45.731 --> 45:46.691
[SPEAKER_04]: Pez candies go in those now?

45:48.032 --> 45:48.993
[SPEAKER_04]: They just may.

45:49.394 --> 45:55.500
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, a sheepskin condom Pez candy dispenser, that might be something to talk about.

45:55.700 --> 45:56.922
[SPEAKER_04]: Just move on, please.

45:57.482 --> 45:58.944
[SPEAKER_04]: So that would make the Pez condiments, right?

46:00.746 --> 46:01.327
[SPEAKER_04]: Hehehe.

46:03.749 --> 46:06.512
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyways, that was my week.

46:06.973 --> 46:09.776
[SPEAKER_04]: As for yesterday, it wasn't that great.

46:09.877 --> 46:13.821
[SPEAKER_04]: It was kind of one of those dramatic family days.

46:14.442 --> 46:17.466
[SPEAKER_04]: I did end up seeing a movie that I'll probably talk about later on.

46:19.508 --> 46:22.569
[SPEAKER_04]: But otherwise, that's really all.

46:22.890 --> 46:34.655
[SPEAKER_04]: Today I bought Taiko Drum Master because I've been like kind of, oh, that's another thing that Jamie and I did on Friday night was I got to play her Taiko Drum Master, which is so much funner with two people, but it's still fun as with one person.

46:35.235 --> 46:35.535
[SPEAKER_04]: Funner.

46:35.795 --> 46:36.135
[SPEAKER_04]: Funner.

46:36.475 --> 46:37.936
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, funner is the new word of the day.

46:38.376 --> 46:39.957
[SPEAKER_04]: So much more fun, whatever, fuck you.

46:41.778 --> 46:42.558
[SPEAKER_04]: Smart ass.

46:43.519 --> 46:46.600
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyways, that's how the week was.

46:49.079 --> 46:56.321
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, I seem to remember that when we moved in together, and you know, you're going to be the roommate and everything, you didn't really like video games an awful lot.

46:56.361 --> 46:57.481
[SPEAKER_22]: Like, you had a few GameCube games.

46:57.501 --> 46:59.082
[SPEAKER_22]: You liked Metroid, you liked Donkey Konga.

47:00.122 --> 47:02.643
[SPEAKER_22]: Now you're running out to GameStop, I gotta get Tycho Drummaster!

47:02.803 --> 47:05.224
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean, Tycho Drummaster's like Donkey Konga.

47:05.564 --> 47:07.504
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a hell of a lot better than Donkey Konga.

47:08.164 --> 47:10.025
[SPEAKER_04]: It's great, but, you know...

47:11.370 --> 47:15.736
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not so much bad with the video game stuff.

47:16.216 --> 47:17.478
[SPEAKER_04]: I can get into stuff.

47:18.079 --> 47:19.500
[SPEAKER_04]: I used to be into it when I was little.

47:21.002 --> 47:22.404
[SPEAKER_04]: I played the Mario Brothers.

47:23.566 --> 47:23.946
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

47:24.767 --> 47:26.269
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, no problem for that.

47:26.469 --> 47:26.830
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

47:28.062 --> 47:29.762
[SPEAKER_22]: We're going to go to a quick break, boys and girls.

47:29.782 --> 47:32.763
[SPEAKER_22]: When we come back, maybe we'll do some Bomani news if there's anything going on.

47:32.783 --> 47:33.603
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know.

47:33.903 --> 47:34.484
[SPEAKER_22]: I have to look.

47:34.544 --> 47:35.284
[SPEAKER_22]: It's been a long week.

47:35.784 --> 47:40.465
[SPEAKER_22]: And we'll also get into the CAVE match tonight at some point, the FU's of the week.

47:40.805 --> 47:41.745
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, I want to talk about this, too.

47:41.825 --> 47:46.527
[SPEAKER_22]: Listen to our podcast this week, boys and girls, because we're going to be giving away PSP games.

47:46.947 --> 47:48.347
[SPEAKER_22]: We're giving away Death Jr.

47:49.287 --> 47:51.428
[SPEAKER_22]: and Coated Arms on this week's podcast.

47:51.628 --> 47:52.248
[SPEAKER_22]: Isn't that lovely?

47:53.328 --> 47:56.069
[SPEAKER_22]: So listen to this week's podcast to figure out how to win.

47:56.509 --> 47:58.269
[SPEAKER_22]: Podcast is over at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.

47:58.289 --> 47:59.710
[SPEAKER_22]: Click on Orange Launch Radio to go.

48:00.650 --> 48:02.610
[SPEAKER_22]: In this break, we're going to hear some music from Poppin' Music 13.

48:03.331 --> 48:11.673
[SPEAKER_22]: Since Loki was so kind to remind me we haven't done some of this music yet, we're going to hear a brand new Sota Fujimori song starting us off with Spring Comes Around.

48:12.093 --> 48:12.873
[SPEAKER_22]: We'll be back after this.

48:13.253 --> 48:16.194
[SPEAKER_22]: Maybe the Skype line, too, when we come back from this break with your calls.

48:16.534 --> 48:17.294
[SPEAKER_22]: OrangeLaunchRadio.com.

48:17.314 --> 48:18.175
[SPEAKER_22]: Click on Interact With Us.

48:18.395 --> 48:19.615
[SPEAKER_22]: We'll be back on Orange Launch Radio.

50:21.505 --> 50:21.756
Thank you.

51:35.889 --> 51:36.811
Thanks for watching!

52:23.268 --> 52:26.639
[SPEAKER_13]: Please tell me, is your role in my heartache?

52:26.679 --> 52:29.789
[SPEAKER_13]: Take me now, but I can't take it anymore

53:00.653 --> 53:01.459
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for watching!

55:37.135 --> 55:37.819
DarkSakura.com

56:25.237 --> 56:28.421
[SPEAKER_22]: After this song, we'll be having a Let Them Move Marathon.

56:28.701 --> 56:30.864
[SPEAKER_13]: No!

56:30.984 --> 56:31.645
[SPEAKER_22]: Just kidding.

56:32.085 --> 56:33.127
[SPEAKER_22]: Orange Lounge Radio.

56:33.207 --> 56:34.808
[SPEAKER_22]: Crap-free Bavani Radio.

56:36.110 --> 56:37.772
[SPEAKER_22]: We're back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

56:37.792 --> 56:39.354
[SPEAKER_22]: That was some music from Poppin' Music 13.

56:40.075 --> 56:42.598
[SPEAKER_22]: I think they're calling that Carnival is the subtitle of that.

56:43.290 --> 56:48.937
[SPEAKER_22]: I haven't followed pop music in a little while, sorry kids, but they don't really have an arcade machine exactly around the corner.

56:49.658 --> 56:57.988
[SPEAKER_22]: Soda Fujimori with Spring Comes Around, the little 8-bit sounding song, I kind of, or actually, it's not so much 8-bit sounding, but it sounds like an old Commodore 64 game, I kind of dig this track.

56:59.377 --> 57:10.280
[SPEAKER_22]: That was Saitone with Opportunity, and DJ Taka with Moon in there as well, featuring Erika Mochizuki, and then Desro was the last one there, and the track is called Sun.

57:10.960 --> 57:15.341
[SPEAKER_22]: Some Japanese text after that I can't read, because it's all garbled on my computer anyway, so Sun something.

57:18.382 --> 57:20.423
[SPEAKER_22]: And a lot of folks in the chat room are saying, hey, it's Daikinkai!

57:20.503 --> 57:21.743
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, yeah, it's Desro.

57:21.763 --> 57:22.523
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I miss?

57:22.823 --> 57:23.003
[SPEAKER_22]: What?

57:23.344 --> 57:25.264
[SPEAKER_06]: I sort of miss the move.

57:26.584 --> 57:28.145
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't think I have that anywhere.

57:28.165 --> 57:28.265
[SPEAKER_22]: Ah!

57:29.093 --> 57:30.174
[SPEAKER_22]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

57:57.973 --> 58:02.954
[SPEAKER_22]: And some folks are kind of wondering, what's so great about the Xbox 360?

58:03.234 --> 58:06.215
[SPEAKER_22]: Should I be going out and picking up one of these Xbox 360s at launch?

58:06.715 --> 58:07.515
[SPEAKER_22]: Should I wait?

58:08.035 --> 58:09.555
[SPEAKER_22]: What games are actually going to be released?

58:09.615 --> 58:13.576
[SPEAKER_22]: And boy, it seems like that launch list of Xbox 360 titles is getting shorter and shorter, doesn't it?

58:13.836 --> 58:14.056
[SPEAKER_22]: Yep.

58:14.616 --> 58:15.976
[SPEAKER_22]: There's another one that moved.

58:16.016 --> 58:16.556
[SPEAKER_22]: What moved now?

58:17.617 --> 58:19.837
[SPEAKER_22]: Wasn't it Project Gotham Racing, wasn't it?

58:19.857 --> 58:21.597
[SPEAKER_22]: No, Project Gotham's still there.

58:21.617 --> 58:22.798
[SPEAKER_22]: That's a launch title.

58:22.898 --> 58:24.758
[SPEAKER_22]: Microsoft's already guaranteed that's going to launch.

58:25.418 --> 58:30.200
[SPEAKER_22]: That cameo and Perfect Dark Zero are guaranteed to launch.

58:30.780 --> 58:33.661
[SPEAKER_22]: In fact, they actually pushed them up a week, so now they're coming out November 10th.

58:34.121 --> 58:42.384
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyways, what did move, though, was Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter, one of the really cool squad-based first-version shooters that was coming out.

58:42.704 --> 58:50.287
[SPEAKER_22]: That got pushed all the way back to February, and before that was Frame City Killer, put out by Namco, which also got pushed back to February.

58:51.099 --> 58:52.100
[SPEAKER_22]: for more tweaking.

58:52.120 --> 58:56.885
[SPEAKER_22]: I think Ghost Recon, what they're trying to do is finish the 360 stuff so they can launch them all at once.

58:57.986 --> 59:03.210
[SPEAKER_22]: So that basically eliminated what I was going to try to bring in as one of the first games.

59:03.651 --> 59:12.419
[SPEAKER_22]: I have pre-booked Gun, which is Grand Theft Auto and the Wild West, and then Project Gotham 3, which looks amazing from what I've seen in the gameplay footage.

59:12.699 --> 59:16.263
[SPEAKER_22]: Plus it has a minigame in it, Geometry Wars 2, which looks pretty cool.

59:16.883 --> 59:18.804
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, what the hell is this about the minigame that's in it?

59:18.864 --> 59:22.725
[SPEAKER_22]: Isn't it like, uh, frickin', you said it was like by the people that did Rez?

59:22.965 --> 59:24.265
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, it's not by the people that did Rez.

59:24.325 --> 59:27.346
[SPEAKER_22]: I said it looks like a cross between Asteroids, Rez.

59:27.406 --> 59:28.547
[SPEAKER_22]: I got really excited for a minute.

59:28.567 --> 59:32.788
[SPEAKER_22]: I was like, oh my god, because Rez is one of those titles that was so sexy and it was completely overlooked.

59:32.808 --> 59:39.170
[SPEAKER_22]: No, it is, it looks pretty cool, and apparently Geometry Wars 1 was available as a hidden game in Project Gotham 2.

59:40.080 --> 59:40.480
[SPEAKER_22]: XBOX Live Arcade

01:00:04.113 --> 01:00:05.493
[SPEAKER_22]: It's kind of a new puzzle game.

01:00:06.093 --> 01:00:10.374
[SPEAKER_22]: Then there's another one that they showed, which is like a Marble Madness type game called Marble Blast.

01:00:11.395 --> 01:00:14.815
[SPEAKER_22]: But then this game, though, is going to be coming with Project Gotham 3.

01:00:15.536 --> 01:00:17.456
[SPEAKER_22]: And I've seen gameplay footage of it.

01:00:17.476 --> 01:00:21.697
[SPEAKER_22]: I was trying to bring some up to show you guys in the studio, but it looks amazing.

01:00:22.137 --> 01:00:23.497
[SPEAKER_22]: And I don't know.

01:00:23.517 --> 01:00:25.578
[SPEAKER_22]: I think it would be a perfect PSP game.

01:00:26.892 --> 01:00:28.673
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm worried about all these titles pushing back.

01:00:28.894 --> 01:00:33.938
[SPEAKER_22]: It's kind of like Microsoft really, really wants this system out this Christmas.

01:00:34.839 --> 01:00:36.220
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, and at this point, they can't push back.

01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:36.900
[SPEAKER_22]: They really can't.

01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:39.302
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, they'll piss off America if they push the system back any further.

01:00:39.322 --> 01:00:40.423
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, they're not going to push the system.

01:00:40.623 --> 01:00:45.788
[SPEAKER_22]: These games at launch... But what's the point of buying the system if there's no games available at launch?

01:00:45.808 --> 01:00:46.989
[SPEAKER_22]: There's going to be like 20-some games.

01:00:47.289 --> 01:00:49.571
[SPEAKER_22]: I know, but nothing that I really want.

01:00:50.191 --> 01:00:50.772
[SPEAKER_22]: Thanks for watching!

01:01:02.987 --> 01:01:12.113
[SPEAKER_22]: I picked up that Tecmo collection, I'm going to talk about this again on the podcast, but that Tecmo collection, I picked it up for Xbox, and it has the arcade game version of Tecmo Bowl on it, so not what I remember.

01:01:12.933 --> 01:01:15.475
[SPEAKER_22]: The NES version was so much more fluid and fun.

01:01:16.295 --> 01:01:16.996
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyway, sorry.

01:01:17.116 --> 01:01:22.479
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyways, for the 360, if you like sports, definitely going to be a system for you.

01:01:23.301 --> 01:01:26.343
[SPEAKER_22]: If you want racing games, there's going to be a lot of stuff.

01:01:26.383 --> 01:01:29.884
[SPEAKER_22]: Project Gotham, Ridge Racer, Need for Speed, Most Wanted.

01:01:30.505 --> 01:01:31.625
[SPEAKER_22]: Those are going to be three big ones.

01:01:31.845 --> 01:01:32.446
[SPEAKER_22]: Carmageddon?

01:01:33.146 --> 01:01:33.766
[SPEAKER_22]: No, Carmageddon.

01:01:33.966 --> 01:01:34.607
[SPEAKER_22]: Full Auto!

01:01:34.927 --> 01:01:36.608
[SPEAKER_22]: Full Auto coming out next year.

01:01:36.668 --> 01:01:37.868
[SPEAKER_22]: That one is exciting.

01:01:38.188 --> 01:01:38.989
[SPEAKER_22]: Put out by Sega.

01:01:39.249 --> 01:01:41.630
[SPEAKER_22]: It's like a cross between Twisted Metal and Burnout.

01:01:41.930 --> 01:01:43.271
[SPEAKER_22]: And all you have to do is mention Burnout.

01:01:43.311 --> 01:01:43.811
[SPEAKER_22]: Basically...

01:01:44.326 --> 01:01:47.788
[SPEAKER_22]: Giant, you know, cars with guns on them, shooting each other, you can blow up buildings.

01:01:47.848 --> 01:01:49.910
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, like Spy Hunter on crack.

01:01:50.150 --> 01:01:50.630
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

01:01:50.650 --> 01:01:51.051
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, cool.

01:01:51.071 --> 01:01:52.451
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, it's going to be freaking awesome.

01:01:52.471 --> 01:01:53.872
[SPEAKER_22]: But anyways, they have that one.

01:01:54.673 --> 01:01:57.715
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, that was the Xbox, that was the problem I had with the Xbox.

01:01:57.735 --> 01:02:07.862
[SPEAKER_22]: Because I, and it's no secret that on this program, because this program's been on long enough, where, you know, when we were first starting this program, PlayStation 2 was kind of new still, and Xbox was just on its way out.

01:02:08.462 --> 01:02:18.326
[SPEAKER_22]: and I said there's no effing way I'm ever going to buy an Xbox because all the Xbox is is sports games, racers, I had an acronym for it.

01:02:18.446 --> 01:02:19.706
[SPEAKER_22]: It's Sarsi.

01:02:19.826 --> 01:02:20.887
[SPEAKER_22]: It's Sarsi games.

01:02:20.927 --> 01:02:21.207
[SPEAKER_22]: That's it.

01:02:21.247 --> 01:02:22.127
[SPEAKER_22]: It's Sars games.

01:02:22.207 --> 01:02:25.308
[SPEAKER_22]: It's sports, action, racing, shooters.

01:02:26.069 --> 01:02:28.429
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, that's pretty much everything that comes out nowadays, though.

01:02:29.870 --> 01:02:32.391
[SPEAKER_22]: I guess because that's what sells, but... Well, let's put it this way.

01:02:32.411 --> 01:02:33.411
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, RPGs.

01:02:33.811 --> 01:02:35.132
[SPEAKER_22]: You've got Cameo, which is...

01:02:36.059 --> 01:02:38.902
[SPEAKER_22]: I do like the rare first-person shooter game.

01:02:39.002 --> 01:02:40.463
[SPEAKER_22]: I love Halo, for one, that's for sure.

01:03:04.111 --> 01:03:19.879
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, then, what else, um, for, like, your non-mainstream stuff, they've got Tony Hawk's American Wasteland, Gun, which is gonna be coming out, King Kong, um, they'll be coming out right afterwards, and then there's a dead spell of nothing until about...

01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:22.281
[SPEAKER_22]: January, I think.

01:03:22.401 --> 01:03:24.142
[SPEAKER_22]: And then that's when there's some more games coming out.

01:03:24.462 --> 01:03:26.824
[SPEAKER_22]: But of course, you know, more stuff will be announced as we get closer.

01:03:26.884 --> 01:03:30.907
[SPEAKER_22]: Is it going to be like the DS launch where they kind of blow their load when the system first comes out?

01:03:30.987 --> 01:03:34.349
[SPEAKER_22]: And then you go through this like, and PSP, oh my god, the PSP.

01:03:34.790 --> 01:03:38.252
[SPEAKER_22]: PSP totally blew its load when it first came out and then six months of nothing.

01:03:38.272 --> 01:03:38.812
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, look at it this way.

01:03:39.113 --> 01:03:42.955
[SPEAKER_22]: December is a dead month as far as games coming out anyways for all systems.

01:03:43.015 --> 01:03:48.219
[SPEAKER_22]: It's just, they push stuff out of, you know, December and there's like 12 games total.

01:03:48.679 --> 01:03:49.360
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, that's it.

01:03:49.801 --> 01:03:51.382
[SPEAKER_22]: And some of us wait until Christmas Eve Eve to do it.

01:03:51.402 --> 01:03:51.582
[SPEAKER_22]: That's me.

01:03:51.602 --> 01:03:53.822
[SPEAKER_22]: December 23rd, every year I do my Christmas shopping.

01:04:15.011 --> 01:04:15.391
[SPEAKER_22]: Bloodstains

01:04:39.526 --> 01:04:40.707
[SPEAKER_22]: No, but I'm hoping.

01:04:40.747 --> 01:04:41.887
[SPEAKER_22]: I wish, but no.

01:04:43.228 --> 01:04:44.848
[SPEAKER_22]: Just really amazing stuff.

01:04:45.069 --> 01:04:47.009
[SPEAKER_22]: Quake 4 is going to be awesome.

01:04:47.630 --> 01:04:49.891
[SPEAKER_22]: Gun is just, I don't even know what Gun's going to be.

01:04:49.911 --> 01:04:50.931
[SPEAKER_22]: Gun's going to be phenomenal.

01:04:51.371 --> 01:04:55.153
[SPEAKER_22]: And then, I don't know, I'm going to pick up one more game.

01:04:55.433 --> 01:04:56.053
[SPEAKER_22]: $60 for these games.

01:04:56.093 --> 01:04:57.654
[SPEAKER_22]: I was looking at EB Games.

01:04:57.674 --> 01:05:00.055
[SPEAKER_22]: They have a whole big display trying to get people to pre-order this stuff.

01:05:00.075 --> 01:05:00.555
[SPEAKER_22]: $60 a game.

01:05:03.021 --> 01:05:03.401
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.

01:05:03.742 --> 01:05:04.102
[SPEAKER_22]: Crazy.

01:05:04.743 --> 01:05:08.646
[SPEAKER_22]: It's lame, but everything I buy is on store credit.

01:05:09.326 --> 01:05:14.271
[SPEAKER_22]: Right, right.

01:05:14.311 --> 01:05:21.497
[SPEAKER_22]: So a lot of people, we have a lot of younger listeners that listen to this program who don't hold down full-time jobs, so they can't exactly run out and buy a system.

01:05:21.797 --> 01:05:24.059
[SPEAKER_22]: And please don't get us wrong either.

01:05:24.179 --> 01:05:28.163
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, yes, I have a full-time job, but it's hard for me to go out and buy these systems.

01:05:28.203 --> 01:05:30.224
[SPEAKER_22]: If gaming wasn't a huge hobby of mine...

01:05:31.245 --> 01:05:40.307
[SPEAKER_22]: That's probably the only reason I'm going to buy a 360 on launch is because I feel like I have to to stay on top of what's going on in the industry for the podcast and stuff.

01:05:40.327 --> 01:05:41.808
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, here's what I'm saying here.

01:05:42.508 --> 01:05:45.629
[SPEAKER_22]: Don't go out and buy the system if you're unsure if you want it or not.

01:05:46.129 --> 01:05:54.271
[SPEAKER_22]: The only reason I'm buying one, same reason I bought PSP close to launch, same reason I bought DS, is because I'm a gaming whore and I'll have to pick this stuff up.

01:05:54.898 --> 01:06:16.029
[SPEAKER_22]: for two reasons, one to stay on, to have an edge at work, you know, the game sales stuff I do, and just an edge on everything, and then also just because I have to get everything, even though, you know, I may not play it, like my GameCube, you know, but it just, there's a lot of stuff coming out, if you have a PSP, definitely pick one of those up, DS,

01:06:17.079 --> 01:06:18.639
[SPEAKER_22]: Tons of stuff for internet, you know?

01:06:18.779 --> 01:06:18.979
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

01:06:19.559 --> 01:06:21.100
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, I'm so excited about DS Internet.

01:06:21.160 --> 01:06:22.980
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm going to have them all anyway.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:26.801
[SPEAKER_22]: I was going to kind of ask you about this because you're kind of a systems whore.

01:06:26.921 --> 01:06:27.841
[SPEAKER_22]: You make no secret about that.

01:06:27.861 --> 01:06:31.422
[SPEAKER_22]: You own, like, is there any system that's ever been released that you do not own?

01:06:31.602 --> 01:06:32.582
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have a CD-i.

01:06:33.222 --> 01:06:35.682
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have a Fairchild Channel S, although Dan has owned one.

01:06:35.702 --> 01:06:36.342
[SPEAKER_22]: Do you have a 3DO?

01:06:36.983 --> 01:06:37.123
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

01:06:37.143 --> 01:06:37.823
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

01:06:37.943 --> 01:06:38.723
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't want a 3DO.

01:06:38.803 --> 01:06:39.223
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, I know.

01:06:39.423 --> 01:06:41.063
[SPEAKER_22]: Who wants a 3DO, really?

01:06:41.103 --> 01:06:43.304
[SPEAKER_22]: Is there any game on the 3DO that makes that system worthwhile?

01:06:43.324 --> 01:06:43.764
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, okay, okay.

01:06:43.784 --> 01:06:43.824
[SPEAKER_06]: A 1?

01:06:44.884 --> 01:06:45.424
[SPEAKER_06]: What do I have?

01:06:46.325 --> 01:06:48.365
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a Neo Geo, I have a Neo Geo CD.

01:06:48.645 --> 01:06:51.386
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, if we ask what you do have, it's going to take you all day.

01:06:51.426 --> 01:06:53.947
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but what I don't have also could take me all day.

01:06:54.087 --> 01:06:59.909
[SPEAKER_06]: The thing that's at the top of my list of what I want right now, realistically, is a Duo RX.

01:07:00.890 --> 01:07:02.230
[SPEAKER_06]: A PC Engine Duo RX.

01:07:02.310 --> 01:07:03.831
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, so we know you're going to get a 360 at launch.

01:07:03.871 --> 01:07:05.371
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm actually wanting the PS3 more.

01:07:07.532 --> 01:07:17.058
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, there's also the fact that your husband works at GameStop, so you also, in your household, kind of have a need to stay on top of what's going on in the gaming world, right?

01:07:17.098 --> 01:07:20.721
[SPEAKER_22]: With you doing the radio and him doing the selling of the items in the store.

01:07:20.801 --> 01:07:26.144
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we're gonna have all that, and on top of that, any game that comes out, he can basically check it out of the store.

01:07:26.344 --> 01:07:26.745
[SPEAKER_22]: Right, right.

01:07:26.765 --> 01:07:28.526
[SPEAKER_06]: He can play it all we want to and put it back.

01:07:28.826 --> 01:07:30.067
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, that's cool.

01:07:30.427 --> 01:07:31.007
[SPEAKER_06]: Not a big deal.

01:07:31.687 --> 01:07:33.568
[SPEAKER_22]: But you say you're more excited about PS3?

01:07:34.168 --> 01:07:34.408
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

01:07:34.488 --> 01:07:35.909
[SPEAKER_06]: Why?

01:07:36.349 --> 01:07:55.555
[SPEAKER_06]: Having studied a bit more on the cell processor myself, prior to seeing the demo at E3, and that knowing that there's going to be a new Tekken, oh my god, and other things that I'm more than positive will be out based on things that I've seen.

01:07:56.235 --> 01:08:02.424
[SPEAKER_22]: The Final Fantasy remake, which I know is still just a rumor but I'm convinced it's happening.

01:08:03.266 --> 01:08:04.187
[SPEAKER_22]: What was the other thing?

01:08:07.150 --> 01:08:09.151
[SPEAKER_22]: Damn it, racing game that's incredibly fun.

01:08:09.171 --> 01:08:10.852
[SPEAKER_22]: Gran Turismo, thank you, Gran Turismo.

01:08:10.872 --> 01:08:12.893
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not as excited about Gran Turismo, but Dan is.

01:08:14.873 --> 01:08:34.462
[SPEAKER_06]: Just knowing that... And on top of that, I really, really hope that people... See, the PlayStation 2, I think, would have been better had people been more skilled in programming games for it because they didn't... There wasn't a lot of... I wouldn't say very good use of the channels because...

01:08:34.742 --> 01:08:36.544
[SPEAKER_06]: Hence the jaggedy games, you know.

01:08:36.844 --> 01:08:40.186
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, oh, let's put in surround sound, but not, you know, make the game look nice.

01:08:41.427 --> 01:08:41.748
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello?

01:08:44.722 --> 01:09:09.615
[SPEAKER_06]: and me, I always go for the underdog system myself so that would normally put me on the boat with the revolution however, I think that the controller is retarded and the Xbox games, I'm really not too excited about anything coming out on the 360 I can't knock the Nintendo controller though until I get to touch it and play a game and see how it really feels racing games, yay sports games

01:09:10.433 --> 01:09:10.833
[SPEAKER_22]: Yay.

01:09:10.913 --> 01:09:14.956
[SPEAKER_22]: And that's, to bring it full circle, that's how I felt about the Xbox when it first came out.

01:09:14.996 --> 01:09:16.757
[SPEAKER_22]: And then sure enough, I got to play it.

01:09:16.777 --> 01:09:19.359
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, all that's going to end up in my house is Project Gotham.

01:09:19.399 --> 01:09:24.162
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm like, I'm tired of Dan playing Need for Speed Underground 2 all the damn time.

01:09:24.242 --> 01:09:26.584
[SPEAKER_22]: He'll bring in Need for Speed Most Wanted then, Underground 3.

01:09:27.605 --> 01:09:28.165
[SPEAKER_22]: Goodie, goodie.

01:09:28.285 --> 01:09:28.746
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay!

01:09:29.146 --> 01:09:30.427
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, gee!

01:09:30.647 --> 01:09:39.313
[SPEAKER_22]: Finally, I caved, and I bought an Xbox when Halo... I finally got to play Halo for the first time, and I was like, wow, this is a shooter I actually really enjoy.

01:09:39.873 --> 01:09:40.874
[SPEAKER_22]: And Halo 2, of course.

01:09:41.274 --> 01:09:46.698
[SPEAKER_22]: The DDR on Xbox, which I still believe the Ultramix 2 is the best DDR game they put out, period.

01:09:47.338 --> 01:09:47.438
[SPEAKER_22]: And...

01:09:49.640 --> 01:09:51.883
[SPEAKER_22]: There's another, Fable, I actually kind of enjoy a little bit.

01:09:52.263 --> 01:09:54.425
[SPEAKER_22]: And all that is on Xbox.

01:09:55.006 --> 01:09:59.491
[SPEAKER_22]: And so Xbox finally kind of grew out of the SARS games for me.

01:09:59.871 --> 01:10:10.382
[SPEAKER_06]: On top of that, I'm probably going to be getting an import PS3 as well, because I know that there are going to be more games coming out overseas on the PS3 than there will be on the Xbox 360.

01:10:11.448 --> 01:10:12.148
[SPEAKER_22]: I want to bring this up.

01:10:12.649 --> 01:10:15.090
[SPEAKER_22]: I've been wanting to bring this topic up on the show for like two weeks.

01:10:15.110 --> 01:10:15.830
[SPEAKER_22]: Now it just hit me.

01:10:16.050 --> 01:10:18.111
[SPEAKER_22]: You saying this reminded me to bring this up.

01:10:20.372 --> 01:10:23.734
[SPEAKER_22]: Obviously, we've been to E3, so we've talked to a lot of people in the industry.

01:10:23.754 --> 01:10:25.274
[SPEAKER_22]: We continue to talk to some of those people.

01:10:25.894 --> 01:10:29.236
[SPEAKER_22]: I was having a very interesting conversation with somebody who works in the industry not that long ago.

01:10:30.817 --> 01:10:39.841
[SPEAKER_22]: This person was saying that there was a game that the company wanted to bring out that had a lot of hype going for it in Japan.

01:10:40.709 --> 01:10:41.050
[SPEAKER_22]: I think.

01:10:41.570 --> 01:10:46.534
[SPEAKER_22]: The game is something that some people in Japan are looking forward to, and they wanted to bring it out here.

01:10:48.156 --> 01:10:57.024
[SPEAKER_22]: But I guess Sony gets some type of approval over what games actually come out for the system, and Sony rejected the game, saying it's too Japanese.

01:10:58.083 --> 01:10:58.744
[SPEAKER_22]: That's stupid.

01:10:59.044 --> 01:11:00.626
[SPEAKER_22]: And I'm thinking, what?

01:11:01.186 --> 01:11:03.729
[SPEAKER_22]: You rejected a game because it's too Japanese?

01:11:04.149 --> 01:11:08.874
[SPEAKER_22]: And then my second thought is, how in the fuck did Katamari Damacy ever come out in this country?

01:11:08.914 --> 01:11:12.098
[SPEAKER_06]: Even better, why did it sell better here than there?

01:11:14.175 --> 01:11:14.675
[SPEAKER_06]: which is true.

01:11:16.456 --> 01:11:17.576
[SPEAKER_22]: That boggled my mind.

01:11:17.596 --> 01:11:19.917
[SPEAKER_06]: From what I understand, the game cut even in Japan.

01:11:20.017 --> 01:11:21.598
[SPEAKER_06]: Here, it just, like, oversold.

01:11:21.958 --> 01:11:23.458
[SPEAKER_22]: No one likes Japanese stuff.

01:11:23.498 --> 01:11:33.042
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, that's why, you know, you see all these networks like G4 TV, oh, I don't know, you know, Cartoon Network, all this stuff.

01:11:33.322 --> 01:11:40.724
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, they're, of course, not playing any anime of any sort whatsoever, so obviously no one likes the Japanese culture at all.

01:11:40.744 --> 01:11:42.565
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, that's why you don't see people out there

01:11:44.365 --> 01:11:58.249
[SPEAKER_22]: And I can see where maybe Sony wants some type of quality control over the games, but... And then I think, my god, why did Driver 3 come out?

01:11:58.389 --> 01:12:03.470
[SPEAKER_06]: All they need, all they need, well actually Sony right now is hiring for localization.

01:12:04.511 --> 01:12:05.491
[SPEAKER_06]: For localization people.

01:12:05.990 --> 01:12:17.599
[SPEAKER_06]: Which leads me to think that, you know, I was taking that as a positive sign for a little while, hoping that they were saying, hey, you know, these import games are, you know, doing really big in the States.

01:12:17.619 --> 01:12:20.661
[SPEAKER_06]: They've got a big, you know, how else did we get DDR here?

01:12:20.681 --> 01:12:25.024
[SPEAKER_22]: That's also a good question, and now Beatmania on its way out, too.

01:12:25.104 --> 01:12:27.846
[SPEAKER_22]: I understand how they could reject the game because it's too Japanese anyways.

01:12:28.187 --> 01:12:30.108
[SPEAKER_22]: So if the game's too Japanese, then it won't sell.

01:12:30.188 --> 01:12:31.709
[SPEAKER_22]: Then that company won't make any money.

01:12:31.809 --> 01:12:33.591
[SPEAKER_22]: At least it's not crap, so it's not...

01:12:33.971 --> 01:12:34.412
[SPEAKER_22]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:12:53.463 --> 01:12:54.304
[SPEAKER_06]: We have DDR now.

01:12:55.045 --> 01:12:56.266
[SPEAKER_06]: And we also have cheap knockoffs.

01:12:56.546 --> 01:13:14.644
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, an interesting follow-up to that is that the same person said that since that game's not going to come out here for the PlayStation now, that a different form, I obviously really don't want to give this away because of the nature of the story, but a different type of game in the series will be coming out on Xbox.

01:13:16.124 --> 01:13:16.764
[SPEAKER_22]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:13:37.041 --> 01:13:37.682
[SPEAKER_06]: The Chaff.

01:13:39.082 --> 01:13:41.884
[SPEAKER_22]: Have you seen some of those budget titles they have now for like PlayStation 1?

01:13:42.344 --> 01:13:44.645
[SPEAKER_22]: Maybe they let those come out because they don't care anymore.

01:13:44.665 --> 01:13:47.486
[SPEAKER_22]: Those are just like the ultimate in... Like the $5 and $10 Walmart games.

01:13:47.506 --> 01:13:48.387
[SPEAKER_22]: Incredible Crisis!

01:13:48.647 --> 01:13:55.070
[SPEAKER_22]: The Texas Hold'em 50,000... Puzzle Star!

01:13:55.110 --> 01:13:57.211
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, and then the PopCap games.

01:13:57.551 --> 01:14:04.054
[SPEAKER_22]: Things that you can play for free on the internet, on Flash, coming out for like Game Boy Advance and PlayStation.

01:14:04.594 --> 01:14:05.735
[SPEAKER_22]: Bejeweled, again!

01:14:05.755 --> 01:14:05.795
[SPEAKER_22]: No!

01:14:06.075 --> 01:14:06.596
[SPEAKER_06]: Catamari Sells

01:14:21.991 --> 01:14:22.792
[SPEAKER_06]: www.orangeloungeradio.com

01:14:43.752 --> 01:14:44.633
[SPEAKER_22]: We're opening that up.

01:14:45.113 --> 01:14:50.116
[SPEAKER_22]: Not a whole lot of people signed into Skype tonight, so I'm thinking maybe we're going to have a dry night of Skype calls.

01:14:50.896 --> 01:14:52.037
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know what's going on, though.

01:14:52.077 --> 01:14:58.721
[SPEAKER_06]: People would... People freaking call, or we set you on fire and do nothing but talk about Britney Spears' baby.

01:14:59.922 --> 01:15:02.523
[SPEAKER_22]: No, I don't want to... Didn't you do that last week?

01:15:02.583 --> 01:15:04.484
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, let's have Britney Spears C-section chat.

01:15:04.524 --> 01:15:05.645
[SPEAKER_22]: No, I don't... Oh, gross.

01:15:05.905 --> 01:15:06.345
[SPEAKER_22]: God.

01:15:06.986 --> 01:15:10.608
[SPEAKER_22]: I would rather go back to talking about the sheepskin con than what the hell I said about it earlier.

01:15:10.628 --> 01:15:12.129
[SPEAKER_06]: She's worried that her scar won't go away.

01:15:13.843 --> 01:15:14.583
[SPEAKER_22]: Poor thing.

01:15:16.024 --> 01:15:17.765
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, and of course she spoke the whole time.

01:15:17.805 --> 01:15:18.405
[SPEAKER_06]: She carried over that.

01:15:18.425 --> 01:15:18.785
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, look at that.

01:15:18.825 --> 01:15:19.445
[SPEAKER_22]: We got a call.

01:15:19.485 --> 01:15:19.905
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at that.

01:15:20.106 --> 01:15:24.007
[SPEAKER_22]: Just for you, DarkSakura, it's our regular caller on the line.

01:15:24.867 --> 01:15:25.388
[SPEAKER_22]: How are you?

01:15:25.408 --> 01:15:27.348
[SPEAKER_22]: Huh?

01:15:27.609 --> 01:15:27.969
[SPEAKER_22]: Hello?

01:15:29.109 --> 01:15:29.409
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

01:15:29.509 --> 01:15:30.370
[SPEAKER_05]: You on the radio?

01:15:32.150 --> 01:15:32.571
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's this?

01:15:34.351 --> 01:15:34.651
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

01:15:36.332 --> 01:15:37.472
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously you know who it is.

01:15:38.073 --> 01:15:39.953
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, it's the legend of Zaku, everybody.

01:15:40.134 --> 01:15:41.014
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you, my friend?

01:15:43.556 --> 01:15:54.711
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just waiting for my Yankees to finish up the Angels so we can take the game to their place tomorrow and win.

01:15:54.951 --> 01:15:56.073
[SPEAKER_05]: What's baseball?

01:15:56.133 --> 01:15:57.455
[SPEAKER_05]: What is the baseball?

01:15:58.596 --> 01:16:00.738
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the number one sport in Japan, ever.

01:16:00.758 --> 01:16:01.539
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm from the Bronx.

01:16:01.699 --> 01:16:03.280
[SPEAKER_05]: I love Yankees.

01:16:03.340 --> 01:16:09.366
[SPEAKER_05]: Yankees are, you know, Yankees basically are up there in breathing and lovemaking.

01:16:09.486 --> 01:16:19.215
[SPEAKER_22]: Saku, I know how it is, because in this town where we live, they don't have a, well, they do have a minor league baseball team, but they have a really big basketball team, and I swear to God, everywhere you go, it's king.

01:16:19.315 --> 01:16:21.217
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

01:16:41.859 --> 01:16:46.145
[SPEAKER_05]: Digital Life starts this Friday, so I'm heading there this Saturday.

01:16:46.625 --> 01:16:50.310
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if I'm going to compete in freestyle because I'm having second thoughts.

01:16:50.830 --> 01:16:54.555
[SPEAKER_05]: The fact that I don't have any money to prepare for a really good one is just making it worse.

01:17:01.623 --> 01:17:06.730
[SPEAKER_22]: I've judged a few, and trust me, Zaku, you couldn't be as bad as some of the ones I've seen in my life.

01:17:07.191 --> 01:17:08.272
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, I've done it before.

01:17:08.312 --> 01:17:10.716
[SPEAKER_05]: I've done a really good one, even though I DQ'd.

01:17:10.756 --> 01:17:17.485
[SPEAKER_05]: But this year, in the tournament this year, they're using an impartial jury.

01:17:18.152 --> 01:17:22.593
[SPEAKER_05]: In other words, they're using people that don't know shit about DER.

01:17:22.613 --> 01:17:25.374
[SPEAKER_06]: That means you're going to have a horribly scored tournament.

01:17:28.214 --> 01:17:35.896
[SPEAKER_05]: No, because last year, the judges were biased and basically handed people victories where they should have went to others.

01:17:36.296 --> 01:17:39.217
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why you have equal representation.

01:17:39.257 --> 01:17:41.338
[SPEAKER_06]: Trust me, it was biased.

01:17:41.458 --> 01:17:41.998
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw it.

01:17:43.158 --> 01:17:46.482
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me finish before you go jumping all over me.

01:17:47.102 --> 01:17:49.404
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why you need equal representation.

01:17:49.444 --> 01:17:54.329
[SPEAKER_06]: You need a certain number of people who know what good freestyle is.

01:17:55.190 --> 01:17:58.554
[SPEAKER_06]: You need at least one freestyle winner in there.

01:17:59.595 --> 01:18:05.440
[SPEAKER_06]: And you need to have two people on there who may not have competed in DDR, but people who...

01:18:06.121 --> 01:18:08.943
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you would trust to be impartial.

01:18:09.224 --> 01:18:12.186
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that you do need to have judges who have not actually played.

01:18:12.266 --> 01:18:13.107
[SPEAKER_22]: I agree with the mix.

01:18:13.207 --> 01:18:14.008
[SPEAKER_22]: I agree with the mix.

01:18:14.028 --> 01:18:14.768
[SPEAKER_06]: We did have that.

01:18:14.928 --> 01:18:16.730
[SPEAKER_05]: We did have that last year, and it failed.

01:18:17.090 --> 01:18:19.552
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that ended up doing more harm than good.

01:18:20.012 --> 01:18:21.554
[SPEAKER_05]: We had everything that we said, Jamie.

01:18:21.814 --> 01:18:24.596
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I've done before, and I've had success.

01:18:24.616 --> 01:18:25.997
[SPEAKER_06]: That has to do with people.

01:18:27.058 --> 01:18:28.800
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, because we have to play it safe.

01:18:28.840 --> 01:18:34.905
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't want any bullshit, and, you know, we don't want any bullshit from other people saying that they got screwed over, that they should have won, so...

01:18:36.104 --> 01:18:38.726
[SPEAKER_05]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

01:19:06.584 --> 01:19:12.187
[SPEAKER_22]: I really wish we were able to get a sneak peek of Guitar Hero 2, but sometimes we just don't get our way.

01:19:13.508 --> 01:19:14.408
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully.

01:19:15.189 --> 01:19:26.495
[SPEAKER_05]: As I said, I still have time to register for freestyle, but at this point I wish I had the money to really invest on something memorable and something that will even give me...

01:19:33.161 --> 01:19:34.502
[SPEAKER_22]: I wish I could have gone to Digital Life.

01:19:34.602 --> 01:19:37.044
[SPEAKER_22]: I would have judged you a fair tournament, I swear.

01:19:37.064 --> 01:19:37.565
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, man.

01:19:37.625 --> 01:19:39.747
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm going to let you go because we have other people who want to get in.

01:19:40.268 --> 01:19:41.248
[SPEAKER_22]: But have a good night, Zaku, okay?

01:19:41.369 --> 01:19:42.149
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright, man.

01:19:42.550 --> 01:19:43.170
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright, later.

01:19:44.111 --> 01:19:46.192
[SPEAKER_22]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

01:20:13.197 --> 01:20:15.159
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyway, moving on, let's see what the next caller wants.

01:20:16.840 --> 01:20:17.981
[SPEAKER_22]: Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:20:20.584 --> 01:20:22.145
[SPEAKER_22]: Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:20:25.268 --> 01:20:26.789
[SPEAKER_22]: Is your microphone on, caller?

01:20:26.929 --> 01:20:27.230
[SPEAKER_22]: Hello.

01:20:28.462 --> 01:20:30.082
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have a throat?

01:20:30.142 --> 01:20:33.323
[SPEAKER_22]: It's a new caller calling in, so I think maybe it's not working right.

01:20:33.783 --> 01:20:35.503
[SPEAKER_22]: What's that, Echo123 or whatever?

01:20:35.523 --> 01:20:38.644
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, give Echo123 a call and try us back, alrighty?

01:20:38.884 --> 01:20:39.264
[SPEAKER_22]: Have a good one.

01:20:39.884 --> 01:20:45.105
[SPEAKER_22]: So, remember guys, before you call in the first time, it's always a good idea to call.

01:20:45.325 --> 01:20:47.706
[SPEAKER_22]: There's a username on Skype, Echo123.

01:20:48.006 --> 01:20:49.426
[SPEAKER_22]: Make sure you can hear yourself.

01:20:49.526 --> 01:20:51.047
[SPEAKER_22]: But, you know, that kind of stuff's bound to happen.

01:20:51.087 --> 01:20:53.247
[SPEAKER_22]: We appreciate the new people are at least trying to get through.

01:20:53.967 --> 01:20:57.688
[SPEAKER_22]: Not that we don't like hearing from the regulars, but new blood once in a while is a good thing.

01:20:58.248 --> 01:21:01.250
[SPEAKER_22]: Let's go to... Oh, damn, our lines are lighting up here.

01:21:01.290 --> 01:21:01.930
[SPEAKER_22]: Let's go to another call.

01:21:02.190 --> 01:21:03.191
[SPEAKER_22]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

01:21:04.512 --> 01:21:06.013
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Sky, it's Al Mullet calling.

01:21:06.193 --> 01:21:06.933
[SPEAKER_00]: Al Mullet!

01:21:06.973 --> 01:21:08.014
[SPEAKER_00]: How the hell have you been?

01:21:09.035 --> 01:21:11.056
[SPEAKER_00]: I have been doing pretty damn good, Sky.

01:21:11.096 --> 01:21:12.257
[SPEAKER_00]: How about yourself?

01:21:12.397 --> 01:21:12.677
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.

01:21:12.817 --> 01:21:15.859
[SPEAKER_22]: I have not heard from you in, like, three months.

01:21:15.879 --> 01:21:16.399
[SPEAKER_22]: Where have you been?

01:21:17.520 --> 01:21:18.921
[SPEAKER_22]: I dropped off the face of the earth.

01:21:19.001 --> 01:21:20.702
[SPEAKER_22]: Funny story, but we'll get to that in a minute.

01:21:20.902 --> 01:21:22.043
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, well, what's on your mind?

01:21:22.103 --> 01:21:23.804
[SPEAKER_22]: What do we owe this call to today?

01:21:25.226 --> 01:21:30.149
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I missed the initial hullabaloo on Extreme 2 and just want to offer my input on it.

01:21:30.309 --> 01:21:31.030
[SPEAKER_22]: Sure, yeah.

01:21:31.130 --> 01:21:36.273
[SPEAKER_22]: A lot of people really appreciate your input because, of course, you write reviews and, of course, I'll let you get your plug.

01:21:36.293 --> 01:21:37.254
[SPEAKER_22]: Are you still working for those guys?

01:21:38.154 --> 01:21:39.155
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I am.

01:21:39.315 --> 01:21:40.776
[SPEAKER_22]: I'll let you work in your plug there.

01:21:41.056 --> 01:21:46.580
[SPEAKER_22]: But a lot of folks in the Bomani scene really trust your reviews on the game, so I'm very curious to hear your thoughts on Extreme 2.

01:21:48.390 --> 01:21:50.572
[SPEAKER_00]: Extreme 2 really impressed me.

01:21:50.772 --> 01:21:57.337
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe not as much as a song list, a song list was great anyway, but the presentation really impressed me.

01:21:58.037 --> 01:22:08.084
[SPEAKER_00]: The fact that Dance Master Mode is now the official mode of the game, it's more like other games, you know, like...

01:22:10.365 --> 01:22:21.349
[SPEAKER_22]: This is why I said about it last week, Amol, is that it feels less like an arcade port and more like a PlayStation game, as opposed to just trying to copy exactly what's going on in the arcade.

01:22:21.709 --> 01:22:26.491
[SPEAKER_22]: Having the Dance Master be the central thing makes it feel more like something that is for the home.

01:22:26.531 --> 01:22:36.135
[SPEAKER_22]: And since we're not getting a new arcade mix anytime soon, it's kind of interesting to see the franchise really now for the first time in America kind of growing out of that.

01:22:36.575 --> 01:22:37.115
[SPEAKER_22]: So it's kind of neat.

01:22:38.188 --> 01:22:38.889
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.

01:22:39.129 --> 01:22:40.830
[SPEAKER_00]: And also the background movies.

01:22:40.870 --> 01:22:47.756
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot get enough of all of these new movies, especially since there's so many exclusive movies for a particular song.

01:22:48.336 --> 01:22:51.619
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Daikin Kai jumped like a million points for me.

01:22:51.919 --> 01:22:52.139
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

01:22:52.620 --> 01:22:53.701
[SPEAKER_00]: I play that for the movie.

01:22:54.941 --> 01:22:55.862
[SPEAKER_22]: It's got some great videos.

01:22:55.902 --> 01:23:02.506
[SPEAKER_22]: I still have yet to see some of the ones, like the one for Sakurai here is really good, and some of the other ones, because I haven't played enough Dance Master Mode.

01:23:02.706 --> 01:23:05.568
[SPEAKER_22]: Believe it or not, I'm actually playing Dance Master Mode on a pad.

01:23:06.068 --> 01:23:11.771
[SPEAKER_22]: So I'm getting slow for some of them.

01:23:13.932 --> 01:23:16.394
[SPEAKER_00]: It took me a week to unlock all the songs.

01:23:16.474 --> 01:23:22.477
[SPEAKER_00]: I ended up with like 73, then I took a break for a few days, and then I came back to it and unlocked Survivor Max.

01:23:24.198 --> 01:23:25.520
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you had a chance to play the online mode?

01:23:26.520 --> 01:23:28.262
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, no, not yet.

01:23:28.442 --> 01:23:35.787
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've tried to find time for it, but things keep popping up, and I'd rather be unlocking courses and whatnot because I'm an unlock whore.

01:23:37.229 --> 01:23:37.749
[SPEAKER_22]: Right, right.

01:23:39.550 --> 01:23:43.413
[SPEAKER_22]: Although, is it true or not, I haven't really heard any follow-up on this.

01:23:43.673 --> 01:23:50.599
[SPEAKER_22]: Some rumors are going around that the game will give you pity unlocks if you go for a long time without unlocking anything, that it finally just starts giving them to you.

01:23:51.414 --> 01:23:56.198
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I can confirm that you will get pity stuff showing up in the shop for no particular reason.

01:23:56.379 --> 01:23:56.679
[SPEAKER_22]: Great.

01:23:57.019 --> 01:24:12.373
[SPEAKER_00]: I only say this because I go back and I do the extra arrow missions and the alternate conditions, and as I'm doing that, unlocking the hidden missions, I'm getting a bunch of songs up here in the shop.

01:24:13.354 --> 01:24:27.488
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's really interesting because I ended up unlocking all the characters at one point and once I unlocked my last character a bunch of songs showed up for no reason.

01:24:28.283 --> 01:24:31.506
[SPEAKER_22]: I noticed a bunch of songs randomly showed up in my shop, too.

01:24:31.606 --> 01:24:38.371
[SPEAKER_22]: So, you know, for those folks that are getting angsty with Dance Master Mode, just keep trying, and the game will pity you eventually, and you'll start getting some cool songs.

01:24:39.212 --> 01:24:39.693
[SPEAKER_22]: Exactly.

01:24:40.193 --> 01:24:43.676
[SPEAKER_22]: One other thing I want to... Well, first of all, go ahead and give your site a plug, because it's been a little while.

01:24:45.241 --> 01:24:50.385
[SPEAKER_00]: www.insidepulse.com We are reviewing games, kicking ass, and taking names.

01:24:50.425 --> 01:24:51.066
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, that rhymed.

01:24:51.286 --> 01:24:51.646
[SPEAKER_22]: Sounds good.

01:24:51.706 --> 01:24:59.992
[SPEAKER_22]: And you also do, like, it's not just games, but there's wrestling, and there's movies and TVs and all that stuff.

01:25:00.473 --> 01:25:04.656
[SPEAKER_00]: Movies, TVs, music, comic books, and action figures.

01:25:05.016 --> 01:25:06.097
[SPEAKER_22]: The whole nine yards.

01:25:06.197 --> 01:25:07.078
[SPEAKER_22]: Everything nerdy.

01:25:07.858 --> 01:25:11.241
[SPEAKER_22]: They just call that beanerd.com because it's everything nerdy.

01:25:14.102 --> 01:25:21.566
[SPEAKER_22]: I have to add, Series 2 of the Invader Zim figurines are out now, and that made me extremely excited.

01:25:21.706 --> 01:25:23.126
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you for that completely random footnote.

01:25:23.446 --> 01:25:26.148
[SPEAKER_06]: Are they, you know, inaction figures?

01:25:26.408 --> 01:25:26.608
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

01:25:26.788 --> 01:25:27.248
[SPEAKER_06]: See what I mean?

01:25:27.408 --> 01:25:27.728
[SPEAKER_06]: Nerds!

01:25:27.929 --> 01:25:28.269
[SPEAKER_22]: All of you!

01:25:28.469 --> 01:25:28.769
[SPEAKER_06]: Nerds!

01:25:29.749 --> 01:25:29.929
What?

01:25:30.510 --> 01:25:34.952
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, you want to talk about nerds, it's a conversation that Extrovert and I had at Lions about glamour.

01:25:36.309 --> 01:25:38.031
[SPEAKER_22]: I know, I know.

01:25:38.091 --> 01:25:43.476
[SPEAKER_22]: Here we are all sitting on the radio show we've been doing about DDR for the past three and a half years.

01:25:44.697 --> 01:25:57.290
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyway, I'm curious also, I have to let you go soon because we're still getting a bunch of other calls, but what I want to ask you about real quick, as somebody who reviews games and has been doing it for a little while, what do you think about this whole Xbox 360 thing?

01:25:57.470 --> 01:25:58.571
[SPEAKER_22]: Are you going to pick one up at launch?

01:25:59.887 --> 01:26:08.970
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm not, because for one, I don't like the pricing structure in order to get the good system with the hard drive, I have to drop an extra hundred bucks.

01:26:09.770 --> 01:26:21.174
[SPEAKER_00]: And so far, the games, especially the launch window, outside of Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion, there's really not much I'm looking forward to that I can't play on my normal Xbox.

01:26:22.075 --> 01:26:22.595
[SPEAKER_22]: There you have it.

01:26:23.515 --> 01:26:23.835
[SPEAKER_22]: All right.

01:26:24.315 --> 01:26:25.936
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, Amal, thanks so much for calling in.

01:26:26.036 --> 01:26:27.116
[SPEAKER_22]: It's really good to hear from you.

01:26:27.257 --> 01:26:28.237
[SPEAKER_22]: Don't be a stranger, all right?

01:26:29.011 --> 01:26:29.311
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

01:26:29.391 --> 01:26:31.111
[SPEAKER_22]: And when's that EX2 review going to be up?

01:26:33.272 --> 01:26:36.013
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully during this week, if I can manage it.

01:26:36.193 --> 01:26:36.453
[SPEAKER_22]: All right.

01:26:36.513 --> 01:26:37.013
[SPEAKER_22]: Sounds good.

01:26:37.753 --> 01:26:40.574
[SPEAKER_22]: Elmo from InsidePulse.com, thank you so much for calling in.

01:26:40.614 --> 01:26:41.314
[SPEAKER_22]: Have a good week, okay?

01:26:42.334 --> 01:26:42.634
[SPEAKER_00]: You too.

01:26:42.694 --> 01:26:42.894
[SPEAKER_22]: All right.

01:26:42.934 --> 01:26:43.114
[SPEAKER_22]: Later.

01:26:44.955 --> 01:26:46.095
[SPEAKER_22]: We're going to go to another call now.

01:26:46.175 --> 01:26:48.815
[SPEAKER_22]: Let's go to – I want to pick up somebody new here.

01:26:48.855 --> 01:26:50.316
[SPEAKER_22]: This one's been trying to get in for a little while here.

01:26:51.056 --> 01:26:52.176
[SPEAKER_22]: Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

01:26:54.237 --> 01:26:55.477
[SPEAKER_22]: Oops, did I actually answer the call?

01:26:55.517 --> 01:26:55.917
[SPEAKER_22]: Probably not.

01:26:57.219 --> 01:26:57.479
[SPEAKER_22]: Hello?

01:26:58.260 --> 01:26:59.280
[SPEAKER_22]: Did I pick both of them up?

01:27:00.401 --> 01:27:01.181
[SPEAKER_22]: I picked up the wrong one.

01:27:01.201 --> 01:27:01.582
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, that's right.

01:27:01.622 --> 01:27:02.622
[SPEAKER_22]: Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.

01:27:04.904 --> 01:27:05.264
[SPEAKER_22]: Hello?

01:27:06.825 --> 01:27:09.586
[SPEAKER_22]: This is the one whose connection wasn't working quite right earlier.

01:27:10.067 --> 01:27:11.728
[SPEAKER_22]: Still can't hear you, buddy.

01:27:11.908 --> 01:27:12.688
[SPEAKER_22]: Still can't hear you, buddy.

01:27:12.728 --> 01:27:13.469
[SPEAKER_22]: Try it again, alright?

01:27:15.510 --> 01:27:16.390
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, let's... Oh, damn.

01:27:16.931 --> 01:27:17.891
[SPEAKER_22]: There was the one I was going to pick up.

01:27:17.931 --> 01:27:18.912
[SPEAKER_22]: Let's pick up...

01:27:22.288 --> 01:27:23.228
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't see that one coming in.

01:27:24.789 --> 01:27:25.549
[SPEAKER_22]: Let's pick up this one.

01:27:26.410 --> 01:27:27.250
[SPEAKER_22]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:27:29.491 --> 01:27:30.891
[SPEAKER_22]: Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:27:33.632 --> 01:27:33.973
[SPEAKER_22]: Hello?

01:27:34.293 --> 01:27:34.653
[SPEAKER_22]: Hello!

01:27:35.893 --> 01:27:36.233
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.

01:27:36.374 --> 01:27:36.654
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi!

01:27:39.595 --> 01:27:39.955
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you hear me?

01:27:39.975 --> 01:27:40.075
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi!

01:27:40.235 --> 01:27:40.595
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi!

01:27:40.735 --> 01:27:41.736
[SPEAKER_03]: You're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:27:44.117 --> 01:27:47.678
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I'm... I think...

01:27:48.911 --> 01:27:49.351
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this Roz?

01:27:49.391 --> 01:27:50.171
[SPEAKER_22]: Massive lag.

01:27:50.572 --> 01:27:51.532
[SPEAKER_22]: No, this isn't Roz.

01:27:51.592 --> 01:27:52.392
[SPEAKER_22]: This is somebody else.

01:27:52.612 --> 01:27:52.992
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello?

01:27:53.193 --> 01:27:54.873
[SPEAKER_22]: Hi, I think there's massive lag.

01:27:54.933 --> 01:27:55.753
[SPEAKER_22]: What's on your mind?

01:27:55.934 --> 01:27:58.194
[SPEAKER_22]: And we'll answer your question or whatever's on your mind.

01:27:58.234 --> 01:27:58.775
[SPEAKER_22]: Tell us what's up.

01:28:02.196 --> 01:28:04.377
[SPEAKER_20]: We have to wait a little bit for the lag here.

01:28:04.577 --> 01:28:05.497
[SPEAKER_22]: Let's see what this person has to say.

01:28:05.517 --> 01:28:05.857
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.

01:28:06.017 --> 01:28:06.257
[SPEAKER_22]: Hi.

01:28:09.018 --> 01:28:11.079
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, is it working?

01:28:12.339 --> 01:28:13.300
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, it's working.

01:28:13.340 --> 01:28:14.400
[SPEAKER_22]: Hurry up and ask your question.

01:28:14.440 --> 01:28:14.940
[SPEAKER_22]: What's on your mind?

01:28:15.200 --> 01:28:16.061
[SPEAKER_22]: Just ask your question.

01:28:16.101 --> 01:28:16.421
[SPEAKER_22]: What's up?

01:28:17.898 --> 01:28:20.741
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I don't play music games that much.

01:28:21.141 --> 01:28:21.441
[SPEAKER_22]: Uh-huh.

01:28:22.963 --> 01:28:28.588
[SPEAKER_03]: But... But I don't... So I don't know what you're talking about.

01:28:29.693 --> 01:28:32.036
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, this is Orange Lounge Radio.

01:28:32.136 --> 01:28:40.745
[SPEAKER_22]: Our Sunday night program was actually, the station kind of started, it has to do with, you know, because the name Orange Lounge actually comes from music-based video games.

01:28:40.785 --> 01:28:47.091
[SPEAKER_22]: And that's kind of how we grew into kind of what we're doing here is that we started by talking about music video games.

01:28:47.131 --> 01:28:51.796
[SPEAKER_22]: So this Sunday night show that we do is kind of a throwback to the music

01:28:52.697 --> 01:28:53.237
[SPEAKER_22]: Thanks for watching!

01:29:13.663 --> 01:29:14.064
[SPEAKER_22]: Thanks for watching!

01:29:33.783 --> 01:29:34.183
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura

01:30:04.005 --> 01:30:06.207
[SPEAKER_22]: Hello, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:30:06.988 --> 01:30:07.469
[SPEAKER_22]: Can you hear us?

01:30:08.630 --> 01:30:10.352
[SPEAKER_22]: Turn down your speakers.

01:30:10.432 --> 01:30:12.614
[SPEAKER_22]: If you can hear us, we cannot hear you, my friend.

01:30:12.654 --> 01:30:13.315
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, wait, wait.

01:30:13.896 --> 01:30:15.017
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to send an IM real quick.

01:30:15.782 --> 01:30:16.822
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

01:30:16.842 --> 01:30:19.304
[SPEAKER_22]: Just a reminder, because we had a lot of new people calling in tonight.

01:30:19.784 --> 01:30:21.465
[SPEAKER_22]: Maybe somebody can post this in the chat room as well.

01:30:22.285 --> 01:30:25.586
[SPEAKER_22]: The first time, before the first time you call, it's always a good idea to call.

01:30:25.886 --> 01:30:27.687
[SPEAKER_22]: It's a username on Skype, Echo123.

01:30:28.348 --> 01:30:34.090
[SPEAKER_22]: And then that way you can test your connection and see if you can hear yourself, because that's a really good way to test the connection.

01:30:34.530 --> 01:30:36.211
[SPEAKER_22]: Let me try one more time here.

01:30:36.411 --> 01:30:36.911
[SPEAKER_22]: Are you there?

01:30:37.972 --> 01:30:38.372
[SPEAKER_22]: Can you hear us?

01:30:40.711 --> 01:30:41.191
[SPEAKER_22]: Hello!

01:30:41.491 --> 01:30:41.852
[SPEAKER_22]: Hi!

01:30:42.272 --> 01:30:42.692
[SPEAKER_22]: Who's this?

01:30:44.093 --> 01:30:44.913
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, this is Roz.

01:30:45.133 --> 01:30:45.773
[SPEAKER_22]: Hi Roz!

01:30:45.853 --> 01:30:46.514
[SPEAKER_22]: What's on your mind?

01:30:49.555 --> 01:30:50.716
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, just fine.

01:30:52.616 --> 01:30:53.217
[SPEAKER_22]: How you doing?

01:30:53.617 --> 01:30:54.998
[SPEAKER_22]: Do you got a question for us?

01:30:55.158 --> 01:30:56.218
[SPEAKER_22]: What are you calling in about tonight?

01:30:56.238 --> 01:30:56.778
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't hear us.

01:30:58.399 --> 01:30:59.099
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't hear me.

01:30:59.119 --> 01:31:00.460
[SPEAKER_06]: I can hear you.

01:31:02.021 --> 01:31:02.121
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh.

01:31:03.880 --> 01:31:06.002
[SPEAKER_22]: Is the call lagged by like 45 seconds?

01:31:06.883 --> 01:31:08.564
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, maybe we're a little lagged.

01:31:08.584 --> 01:31:12.827
[SPEAKER_22]: I think the call was incredibly lagged here because I think she's just now getting the stuff we said in the beginning.

01:31:13.168 --> 01:31:14.649
[SPEAKER_22]: Roz, I'm going to have to let you go for right now.

01:31:14.689 --> 01:31:17.111
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm really sorry, but try calling us back in a little while.

01:31:17.571 --> 01:31:18.792
[SPEAKER_22]: Something's up with the connection tonight.

01:31:19.132 --> 01:31:19.773
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know what's going on.

01:31:19.793 --> 01:31:23.096
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm still here, yeah.

01:31:23.276 --> 01:31:24.116
[SPEAKER_22]: Maybe she'll get to the question.

01:31:26.118 --> 01:31:27.900
[SPEAKER_22]: The question part should be coming up now on the call.

01:31:28.760 --> 01:31:30.041
[SPEAKER_22]: Live radio, everybody.

01:31:30.522 --> 01:31:33.324
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, she's getting lagged.

01:31:33.527 --> 01:31:34.808
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, I figure it's probably really lagged.

01:31:40.675 --> 01:31:45.300
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, we're going to have to go ahead and let Roz go for right now, but hopefully she'll give us a call back a little later in the program.

01:31:46.001 --> 01:31:47.522
[SPEAKER_22]: Let's try to go to this call.

01:31:47.642 --> 01:31:49.945
[SPEAKER_22]: Remember guys, Echo 1-2-3, unfortunately lagged.

01:31:49.965 --> 01:31:52.888
[SPEAKER_22]: There's not a whole lot we can do about, but we'll give it a try.

01:31:53.469 --> 01:31:54.330
[SPEAKER_22]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

01:31:55.518 --> 01:31:55.878
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, hi.

01:31:56.219 --> 01:31:56.559
[SPEAKER_21]: Hi.

01:31:57.660 --> 01:32:00.642
[SPEAKER_21]: Hold on, I'm getting an echo because I'm still listening to your show.

01:32:00.662 --> 01:32:01.343
[SPEAKER_21]: That's all right.

01:32:01.743 --> 01:32:02.784
[SPEAKER_22]: Luckily, we don't hear it.

01:32:02.864 --> 01:32:07.127
[SPEAKER_22]: And I'm very happy that we're picking up a call that's unlagged and we can hear the person just fine.

01:32:07.548 --> 01:32:08.068
[SPEAKER_22]: It's all good.

01:32:08.148 --> 01:32:10.030
[SPEAKER_22]: So go ahead and turn that down.

01:32:10.150 --> 01:32:11.131
[SPEAKER_22]: And what's on your mind?

01:32:13.653 --> 01:32:13.853
[SPEAKER_22]: Um...

01:32:15.740 --> 01:32:16.581
[SPEAKER_21]: Actually, I don't really know.

01:32:17.222 --> 01:32:18.363
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, well, who's this?

01:32:18.443 --> 01:32:19.204
[SPEAKER_21]: Introduce yourself.

01:32:20.725 --> 01:32:22.947
[SPEAKER_21]: This is Xander from Florida.

01:32:22.967 --> 01:32:24.008
[SPEAKER_21]: Hi, Xander.

01:32:25.450 --> 01:32:26.351
[SPEAKER_21]: Hi, Xander from Florida.

01:32:27.051 --> 01:32:29.153
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, there's a massive time difference.

01:32:29.214 --> 01:32:30.175
[SPEAKER_21]: It's like 11 o'clock here.

01:32:30.575 --> 01:32:31.856
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm staying up way past my bedtime.

01:32:32.577 --> 01:32:33.077
[SPEAKER_22]: I know.

01:32:33.438 --> 01:32:38.583
[SPEAKER_22]: We really kind of screw over our East Coast fans with the timing of this show, but the problem is that, you know...

01:32:40.164 --> 01:32:45.825
[SPEAKER_22]: We're all people that work during the week, Monday through Friday, so Saturday and Sunday are kind of like our days off.

01:32:45.885 --> 01:32:53.166
[SPEAKER_22]: So if we were to do our show at like 4.30 or a time that would cater more to the East Coast folks, we would pretty much be losing a day of our weekend.

01:32:53.226 --> 01:32:55.607
[SPEAKER_22]: So that's unfortunately why we have to do it early.

01:32:55.627 --> 01:32:57.967
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, later on.

01:32:58.147 --> 01:32:59.968
[SPEAKER_22]: And we aren't paid well enough to do it early.

01:32:59.988 --> 01:33:01.568
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, we don't get paid for this crap either.

01:33:02.928 --> 01:33:07.529
[SPEAKER_22]: But of course, that's another reason why we do the podcast, is so that folks can download that whenever they want.

01:33:08.789 --> 01:33:10.793
[SPEAKER_22]: So, I'm assuming you heard about the show through the podcast?

01:33:12.155 --> 01:33:14.699
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, no, actually, I heard about it through DDR Freak.

01:33:14.939 --> 01:33:21.230
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, right on, okay, yeah, we got a lot of folks from DDR Freak, because, you know, people whore... I haven't warned you for anything yet, have I?

01:33:22.768 --> 01:33:23.608
[SPEAKER_21]: No, actually, I don't.

01:33:23.708 --> 01:33:24.569
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm not on the forums.

01:33:24.669 --> 01:33:25.329
[SPEAKER_21]: I just, you know.

01:33:25.569 --> 01:33:26.009
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

01:33:26.029 --> 01:33:26.809
[SPEAKER_06]: He's a lurker.

01:33:26.869 --> 01:33:27.670
[SPEAKER_06]: I will if you want me to.

01:33:27.910 --> 01:33:28.650
[SPEAKER_21]: He's a lurker.

01:33:28.750 --> 01:33:29.270
[SPEAKER_06]: He's a voyeur.

01:33:29.290 --> 01:33:30.111
[SPEAKER_21]: He just watches.

01:33:30.131 --> 01:33:31.111
[SPEAKER_21]: That's awesome.

01:33:31.151 --> 01:33:32.331
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm a lurker on a lot of stuff.

01:33:32.592 --> 01:33:33.072
[SPEAKER_21]: That's good.

01:33:33.132 --> 01:33:33.432
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

01:33:33.572 --> 01:33:34.992
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay, we have a stalker.

01:33:37.353 --> 01:33:39.154
[SPEAKER_21]: I wanted to talk to Jamie about in the group.

01:33:39.714 --> 01:33:41.655
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, uh-oh, uh-oh, I'm in trouble.

01:33:41.795 --> 01:33:43.336
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, what's up?

01:33:44.216 --> 01:33:52.621
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, um, I'm a big fan of In The Groove, and I would say that you are massively wrong in saying that it is a rip-off.

01:33:52.841 --> 01:33:55.562
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, let me finish, let me finish.

01:33:55.802 --> 01:33:56.022
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes?

01:33:57.263 --> 01:33:57.823
[SPEAKER_21]: Go ahead.

01:33:58.003 --> 01:34:00.345
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I find it much more fun than DDR.

01:34:00.585 --> 01:34:01.565
[SPEAKER_06]: How is it not a rip-off?

01:34:03.086 --> 01:34:06.468
[SPEAKER_02]: Well... And I want examples, item by item.

01:34:07.588 --> 01:34:08.849
[SPEAKER_22]: Hold on, let the man finish his thoughts.

01:34:11.481 --> 01:34:15.705
[SPEAKER_22]: What is more fun for you for In The Groove as opposed to DDR?

01:34:15.785 --> 01:34:20.970
[SPEAKER_22]: Once I got to about the 9-footers in DDR, it got kind of boring for me because it just kind of stagnated.

01:34:28.537 --> 01:34:34.500
[SPEAKER_21]: at that point, and then the 10s, there's too much of a gap between the 9s and the 10s, so it's too hard to get into, like, the max and stuff.

01:34:35.420 --> 01:34:44.424
[SPEAKER_21]: So, I found within the groove, you have much harder 9s on Expert, and easier 10s, so the gap is kind of closed, and I can have a lot more fun in between.

01:34:45.184 --> 01:34:50.807
[SPEAKER_21]: Which is basically where I am, so... Just out of curiosity, do you play on controller or play on actual dance pad?

01:34:51.287 --> 01:34:54.008
[SPEAKER_21]: No, I play on the dance mat.

01:34:54.408 --> 01:34:55.349
[SPEAKER_21]: What dance mat are you using?

01:34:56.569 --> 01:35:00.153
[SPEAKER_21]: The Red Octane, the foam mat.

01:35:00.573 --> 01:35:01.834
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, my Ignition 3.0.

01:35:02.795 --> 01:35:03.095
[SPEAKER_22]: Ignition 3.0.

01:35:03.456 --> 01:35:04.176
[SPEAKER_22]: No, 2.0.

01:35:04.977 --> 01:35:05.437
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, 2.0.

01:35:05.637 --> 01:35:19.470
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, so for you, the thing that makes In The Groove a little more exciting than DDR is the fact that there's more middle ground, like 9.5 level step patterns, that some of the step patterns cater more to an advanced level.

01:35:20.498 --> 01:35:22.100
[SPEAKER_21]: Right, and Charlene's awesome.

01:35:22.540 --> 01:35:24.542
[SPEAKER_06]: That's never been my point.

01:35:24.582 --> 01:35:28.305
[SPEAKER_06]: My point is that it took something and basically stole the idea.

01:35:29.346 --> 01:35:33.870
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm very much one for innovation, and there is no innovation.

01:35:33.910 --> 01:35:35.051
[SPEAKER_06]: They basically took the DDR.

01:35:35.071 --> 01:35:36.352
[SPEAKER_21]: They have the hands and the minds.

01:35:37.361 --> 01:35:41.863
[SPEAKER_21]: And they're willing to do much harder songs than Konami was ever willing to do with DDR.

01:35:42.164 --> 01:35:49.207
[SPEAKER_06]: But the fact remains that you take a game using four arrows that you have to step on in pattern.

01:35:50.108 --> 01:35:55.450
[SPEAKER_21]: Are you going to say the same thing about Dragon Warrior and Final Fantasy?

01:35:55.590 --> 01:35:58.472
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, they're the same style of game, but that doesn't mean they're a ripoff of each other.

01:36:00.183 --> 01:36:07.388
[SPEAKER_06]: The systems were actually... You can't compare RPGs that come out at the same time.

01:36:07.428 --> 01:36:12.611
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be like comparing Grindio with Final Fantasy, even though they have two different combat systems.

01:36:12.651 --> 01:36:18.856
[SPEAKER_22]: I've heard a similar argument to this before, and it's saying that you don't say Mario and Sonic is the common one I hear.

01:36:18.876 --> 01:36:25.160
[SPEAKER_22]: But for me, honestly, Mario and Sonic is not the accurate comparison when it comes to In the Groove and DDR for me.

01:36:25.200 --> 01:36:28.942
[SPEAKER_22]: It's Mario and this old Commodore 64 game called The Great Gianna Sisters,

01:36:30.383 --> 01:36:36.065
[SPEAKER_22]: was an awful lot like Mario Brothers, except they had like a couple, it was girls, and there was a couple extra things in it.

01:36:36.125 --> 01:36:38.226
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like in here, Sonic and Jazz Jackrabbit.

01:36:38.986 --> 01:36:39.287
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay?

01:36:39.827 --> 01:36:51.411
[SPEAKER_06]: But the whole fact of the matter remains, and this is why to this day I will be against in the group, was the fact that they were saying, hey, take DDR machines and modify them.

01:36:51.931 --> 01:36:52.732
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, let's break...

01:36:53.932 --> 01:36:56.034
[SPEAKER_21]: That's why they have the dedicated cabinets now for In The Groove 2.

01:36:56.554 --> 01:37:05.301
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, they have that now, but the whole fact remains that the origin of In The Groove was a rip-off and modification of DDR.

01:37:06.061 --> 01:37:06.962
[SPEAKER_21]: And what about Step Mania?

01:37:07.742 --> 01:37:09.544
[SPEAKER_06]: Step Mania was never marketed for sale.

01:37:11.110 --> 01:37:13.672
[SPEAKER_22]: In the Groove is kind of Stepmania marketed for sale in a way.

01:37:13.712 --> 01:37:14.732
[SPEAKER_22]: You could argue that.

01:37:14.813 --> 01:37:22.519
[SPEAKER_06]: Had Stepmania been released as an item for sale, which is why I was against those kits that they were selling on eBay, the same thing.

01:37:22.999 --> 01:37:24.020
[SPEAKER_06]: It is a ripoff.

01:37:24.280 --> 01:37:27.983
[SPEAKER_06]: It is stealing proprietary information from Konami.

01:37:30.285 --> 01:37:31.446
[SPEAKER_02]: That is where my point is.

01:37:32.006 --> 01:37:37.211
[SPEAKER_06]: And to this day, I will consider In the Groove a cheap knockoff because they will not admit their fault.

01:37:37.810 --> 01:37:48.608
[SPEAKER_22]: Despite the fact, now to play devil's advocate here with our caller a little bit, despite the fact that In The Groove might have some more challenging steps and songs that appeal to a different audience.

01:37:50.155 --> 01:37:54.517
[SPEAKER_06]: I will give it that it's got interesting stuff, although the earlier level steps were actually complete crap.

01:37:55.417 --> 01:37:56.597
[SPEAKER_06]: I do like some of the music better.

01:37:58.358 --> 01:38:03.620
[SPEAKER_06]: The only reason that I didn't play anything harder on In the Groove when I played it is I was fresh off of a car accident.

01:38:04.420 --> 01:38:08.741
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I was having this issue with my hip pointing to dislocate itself every time I stepped funny.

01:38:10.102 --> 01:38:11.962
[SPEAKER_06]: So I didn't get a chance to try anything harder.

01:38:12.002 --> 01:38:13.943
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not saying it's not a fun game.

01:38:14.443 --> 01:38:16.064
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not saying it doesn't offer challenge.

01:38:16.224 --> 01:38:19.305
[SPEAKER_06]: My whole point comes with the origin of the game, and that's why I'm against it.

01:38:19.625 --> 01:38:23.149
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't believe in thievery in the industry Why don't you like the game?

01:38:35.183 --> 01:38:36.023
[SPEAKER_22]: What I don't like about the game?

01:38:36.163 --> 01:38:38.024
[SPEAKER_22]: First off, the interface is extremely plain.

01:38:38.044 --> 01:38:41.826
[SPEAKER_22]: It looks like whoever made the skin crapped it out in about five minutes.

01:38:42.026 --> 01:38:43.447
[SPEAKER_22]: The songs are all very generic.

01:38:43.507 --> 01:38:46.568
[SPEAKER_22]: They sound very alike, and it's just really generic sounding stuff.

01:38:47.268 --> 01:38:48.349
[SPEAKER_22]: The step patterns suck.

01:38:48.429 --> 01:38:49.069
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't like them.

01:38:49.769 --> 01:38:53.691
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't like the fact that there are hands and feet, or whatever, you know, the hands part of it.

01:38:54.051 --> 01:38:54.611
[SPEAKER_22]: It's retarded.

01:38:54.711 --> 01:38:56.152
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't like the feet, Loki.

01:38:56.252 --> 01:39:02.436
[SPEAKER_06]: I was kind of against the whole involvement of the eye toy for DDR.

01:39:02.456 --> 01:39:06.018
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm talking about the three steps at once, or the four steps at once.

01:39:06.118 --> 01:39:06.778
[SPEAKER_22]: It's retarded.

01:39:06.878 --> 01:39:07.979
[SPEAKER_22]: It's just like, pump it up.

01:39:08.099 --> 01:39:10.080
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, and I hate it in Pump It Up.

01:39:10.240 --> 01:39:11.921
[SPEAKER_22]: I hate Pump It Up, the way they have that.

01:39:12.361 --> 01:39:18.605
[SPEAKER_22]: Although I like, you know what, I really, really like that recent pump release for Home because it's an awesome dance game, it really is.

01:39:18.965 --> 01:39:23.947
[SPEAKER_22]: But still, some of the steps in Pump It Up are just as asinine as Paranoia Survivor Max or The Water.

01:39:23.967 --> 01:39:26.509
[SPEAKER_22]: All I said was it didn't look like they put that much polish in it.

01:39:27.089 --> 01:39:27.409
[SPEAKER_22]: That's it.

01:39:27.549 --> 01:39:30.471
[SPEAKER_22]: And in the group too, I'm sorry, they didn't put that much polish into that one either.

01:39:30.511 --> 01:39:31.692
[SPEAKER_22]: They just changed the interface.

01:39:31.732 --> 01:39:40.997
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I could have also made a better cover with an afternoon in Illustrator with my, like, all of, you know, five week skill in Illustrator than they did.

01:39:41.317 --> 01:39:41.938
[SPEAKER_22]: To each his own.

01:39:41.958 --> 01:39:43.579
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, I don't care if you play the game.

01:39:43.639 --> 01:39:45.500
[SPEAKER_22]: I think it's cool if you're supporting another company.

01:39:45.580 --> 01:39:46.481
[SPEAKER_22]: Hey, you know what?

01:39:46.601 --> 01:39:53.767
[SPEAKER_22]: There needs to be more dancing games out there, and just maybe deviate a little bit more from DDR than you did before.

01:39:53.947 --> 01:39:55.908
[SPEAKER_06]: I know what will make everybody happy.

01:39:55.968 --> 01:39:58.030
[SPEAKER_06]: We have DDR Food Mix.

01:39:58.450 --> 01:40:03.754
[SPEAKER_06]: They just hire the Food Mix people and say, make us a DDR mix and market that, and then everyone will be happy.

01:40:03.794 --> 01:40:04.655
[SPEAKER_22]: But it'd still be a rip-off.

01:40:05.396 --> 01:40:06.437
[SPEAKER_06]: I said Konami needs to.

01:40:06.977 --> 01:40:09.099
[SPEAKER_21]: It's a rip-off within the same company, though.

01:40:09.139 --> 01:40:10.220
[SPEAKER_21]: That's kind of her point.

01:40:11.300 --> 01:40:13.822
[SPEAKER_06]: But if Konami releases it, it's not a rip-off.

01:40:13.902 --> 01:40:15.523
[SPEAKER_22]: I miss the Konami doing it part.

01:40:15.543 --> 01:40:17.305
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it's Konami's intellectual property.

01:40:18.025 --> 01:40:21.848
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright, this discussion's been going on an awful long time.

01:40:21.888 --> 01:40:27.072
[SPEAKER_06]: All I want is for the in-the-group fans to admit that it's a rip-off.

01:40:28.359 --> 01:40:29.540
[SPEAKER_22]: I completely respect your opinion, by the way.

01:40:45.731 --> 01:40:46.391
[SPEAKER_22]: All right, that's good.

01:40:46.591 --> 01:40:47.392
[SPEAKER_06]: Even if I disagree.

01:40:47.752 --> 01:40:48.552
[SPEAKER_22]: All right, later, dude.

01:40:49.673 --> 01:40:49.973
[SPEAKER_22]: All right.

01:40:50.853 --> 01:40:51.494
[SPEAKER_22]: Very interesting.

01:40:51.814 --> 01:40:54.135
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just like, you know, I just don't care.

01:40:54.575 --> 01:40:54.895
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't.

01:40:55.415 --> 01:40:56.976
[SPEAKER_06]: But honestly, it's the same.

01:40:57.016 --> 01:40:59.337
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm not even adamant about pointing out that it's a ripoff.

01:40:59.357 --> 01:40:59.857
[SPEAKER_06]: Who cares?

01:41:00.418 --> 01:41:00.798
[SPEAKER_06]: Who cares?

01:41:00.878 --> 01:41:05.620
[SPEAKER_06]: That's actually all I care about is people admitting that they basically stole.

01:41:05.900 --> 01:41:07.961
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it should all come out in the courts pretty soon.

01:41:08.061 --> 01:41:12.224
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, not pretty soon, but... Yeah, as soon as Rockstar gets the Smackdown laid on him, sure.

01:41:12.724 --> 01:41:13.945
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright, new topic, new topic.

01:41:13.965 --> 01:41:16.346
[SPEAKER_22]: Let's see if our next call... I'm going to try this guy one more time here.

01:41:16.366 --> 01:41:17.947
[SPEAKER_22]: Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.

01:41:18.148 --> 01:41:20.309
[SPEAKER_22]: Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.

01:41:20.329 --> 01:41:23.731
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not even adamant about, like, pointing out... Feedback!

01:41:24.131 --> 01:41:25.292
[SPEAKER_22]: We got really bad feedback there.

01:41:25.312 --> 01:41:26.573
[SPEAKER_22]: Turn down your speakers.

01:41:27.053 --> 01:41:28.754
[SPEAKER_22]: Hello?

01:41:28.995 --> 01:41:29.255
[SPEAKER_22]: Hello?

01:41:29.815 --> 01:41:30.135
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

01:41:30.896 --> 01:41:32.217
[SPEAKER_20]: Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.

01:41:32.677 --> 01:41:34.118
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, you guys are really choppy.

01:41:35.570 --> 01:41:36.051
[SPEAKER_20]: It happens.

01:41:36.131 --> 01:41:37.772
[SPEAKER_22]: Skype is really weird.

01:41:38.132 --> 01:41:39.273
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright.

01:41:40.253 --> 01:41:42.394
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, hey, first time caller.

01:41:44.436 --> 01:41:45.576
[SPEAKER_22]: What's on your mind, my friend?

01:41:45.596 --> 01:41:45.897
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright.

01:41:45.917 --> 01:41:47.258
[SPEAKER_20]: Main reason I called in...

01:41:52.532 --> 01:42:07.553
[SPEAKER_20]: Assuming that I don't win an Xbox 360 from the whole Mountain Dew, Pepsi, win an Xbox 360 every 10 minutes thing that I've been religiously collecting money for, should I sell my PSP?

01:42:08.240 --> 01:42:10.881
[SPEAKER_20]: to help fund an Xbox 360 in your opinion?

01:42:12.242 --> 01:42:19.644
[SPEAKER_22]: We're going to have to hang up on you because of the feedback, but keep listening.

01:42:20.765 --> 01:42:26.327
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright, so keep listening because we're going to get to this guy's call here, and we're just getting really bad feedback on that call, but we want to answer the question.

01:42:26.367 --> 01:42:33.450
[SPEAKER_22]: So the question was, assuming that I cannot win an Xbox 360 through the every 10 minutes competition that's going on, which

01:42:34.410 --> 01:42:36.793
[SPEAKER_22]: You're not going to win one.

01:42:36.853 --> 01:42:39.556
[SPEAKER_22]: If you do win one, hats off to you.

01:42:39.917 --> 01:42:42.940
[SPEAKER_22]: Every nerd drinks Mountain Dew unless they're on a diet.

01:42:43.340 --> 01:42:47.565
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a nerd and I don't drink Mountain Dew because I think it tastes like pee.

01:42:47.585 --> 01:42:52.291
[SPEAKER_22]: You have a better chance of getting a 360 doing one of those referral programs than you would doing the...

01:42:52.751 --> 01:42:55.832
[SPEAKER_06]: You have a better chance of getting a 360 by saving up the money and buying one.

01:42:55.852 --> 01:42:57.093
[SPEAKER_22]: Not to knock it, though, dude.

01:42:57.353 --> 01:42:59.674
[SPEAKER_22]: If you're going to try that way, have fun with it.

01:42:59.774 --> 01:43:03.095
[SPEAKER_22]: And Mountain Dew, I like Mountain Dew, but it's too many calories for me.

01:43:03.415 --> 01:43:04.775
[SPEAKER_22]: How dumb do I sound?

01:43:04.795 --> 01:43:09.417
[SPEAKER_06]: But back to the subject, the thing is, should he sell his PSP to get an Xbox 360?

01:43:09.957 --> 01:43:14.799
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that you should sell your PSP to get a Turbo Express, because Better Games came out on the Turbo Duo.

01:43:16.620 --> 01:43:19.441
[SPEAKER_22]: No, they need to bring back my LiveWire, because I love that.

01:43:20.122 --> 01:43:21.925
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't want to drink Shasta.

01:43:33.800 --> 01:43:36.682
[SPEAKER_22]: Should I sell a PSP to get an Xbox 360?

01:43:37.042 --> 01:43:41.546
[SPEAKER_22]: Here's the golden rule of gaming, and we've said this if you're going to judge a system time and time again.

01:43:42.006 --> 01:43:45.328
[SPEAKER_22]: A system is only as good as the games that they put out on it.

01:43:45.989 --> 01:43:46.850
[SPEAKER_06]: I have always said that.

01:43:46.950 --> 01:43:51.053
[SPEAKER_22]: I know you have, and I'm repeating it because it's the golden rule of gaming, and I say apply it here.

01:43:51.693 --> 01:43:53.354
[SPEAKER_22]: Look at the games that are coming out for Xbox 360.

01:43:54.455 --> 01:43:55.677
[SPEAKER_22]: Are you into racing games?

01:43:55.797 --> 01:43:57.099
[SPEAKER_22]: Are you into sports games?

01:43:57.219 --> 01:43:58.821
[SPEAKER_22]: Is Gun something that interests you?

01:43:58.881 --> 01:44:00.824
[SPEAKER_22]: Is Dead or Alive series something that interests you?

01:44:01.285 --> 01:44:04.870
[SPEAKER_22]: If these are games that interest you, Xbox 360 is the way to go.

01:44:06.076 --> 01:44:24.694
[SPEAKER_22]: If, on the other hand, you're more into the types of things you can do on a handheld and the things that are going to be coming out for PSP, if you want the new Katamari PSP game, if you want Metal Gear Acid 2 and the tactical games and more portable things, and you like to watch movies on the go, then PSP is more for you.

01:44:25.635 --> 01:44:30.799
[SPEAKER_22]: So, while we can kind of make a decision based on what our preference would be,

01:44:32.633 --> 01:44:33.913
[SPEAKER_22]: Honestly, I couldn't decide.

01:44:34.934 --> 01:44:58.260
[SPEAKER_22]: Honestly, if this were me, if I were absolutely poor and I had no way to afford these games right now, I didn't have a job, I was unemployed, so I had to cut back on my gaming, regardless or not, like it or not, I would probably hold on to my PSP for right now and stick it out a little bit longer because there's really nothing that's coming out for the 360 for me right now that's making me go, oh my gosh,

01:44:58.800 --> 01:45:00.101
[SPEAKER_22]: I have to have this right now.

01:45:00.121 --> 01:45:04.965
[SPEAKER_22]: And what if you get the 360 and then the PS3 comes out and you're like, oh crap, I wanted to get that instead.

01:45:05.125 --> 01:45:05.485
[SPEAKER_22]: Exactly.

01:45:05.525 --> 01:45:08.307
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, I would wait until this stuff comes out.

01:45:08.548 --> 01:45:11.510
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, honestly, it doesn't look like there's that much stuff coming at launch.

01:45:12.677 --> 01:45:14.639
[SPEAKER_22]: and just stick with the PSP for now.

01:45:15.119 --> 01:45:18.862
[SPEAKER_22]: Especially if you're going to invest in the 360, you're going to be investing quite a bit of money.

01:45:18.882 --> 01:45:19.863
[SPEAKER_22]: You know what, that's a really good idea.

01:45:21.024 --> 01:45:27.590
[SPEAKER_22]: When the Xbox 360 comes out and you can play this at GameStop, EB Games, your favorite retailer, play the demos, maybe you can make a better decision at that point.

01:45:27.850 --> 01:45:31.953
[SPEAKER_22]: There's no reason you have to get a 360 the day it comes out unless...

01:45:32.793 --> 01:45:34.134
[SPEAKER_22]: There's just this game you're dying for.

01:45:34.295 --> 01:45:38.739
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, I personally do not advocate trading in your systems or games unless the game is crap.

01:45:39.560 --> 01:45:48.970
[SPEAKER_06]: For the simple reason, I often find moments where like, oh, I want to play this game and I'll go bust out the Neo Geo and freaking play King of Fighters 2000.

01:45:49.931 --> 01:45:53.255
[SPEAKER_22]: How many people do we know that has sold back a system and then had to buy it again later?

01:45:54.327 --> 01:45:56.490
[SPEAKER_06]: I know many, many folks.

01:45:57.271 --> 01:45:58.011
[SPEAKER_22]: I've done it myself.

01:45:58.091 --> 01:46:06.481
[SPEAKER_06]: And we ourselves, the only system that we have actually ever gotten rid of was our Nintendo 64, and we are borrowing somebody else's.

01:46:07.415 --> 01:46:09.938
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I mean, it doesn't really matter.

01:46:10.318 --> 01:46:24.695
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, there's been days where we've broken out the ColecoVision and freaking had a golf fest or played Venture, you know, only to put it up, you know, an hour later and break out the TurboGrafx and play a bunch of bonks.

01:46:24.895 --> 01:46:26.176
[SPEAKER_22]: I think that's another good element to look at.

01:46:26.216 --> 01:46:30.120
[SPEAKER_22]: If you're going to sell that PSP back, think to yourself, am I going to regret this later?

01:46:30.180 --> 01:46:35.024
[SPEAKER_22]: Is there going to be a game coming out for PSP that I'm going to really, really want later?

01:46:35.825 --> 01:46:37.506
[SPEAKER_22]: What the hell else is coming out on PSP?

01:46:38.187 --> 01:46:40.209
[SPEAKER_22]: Loki, what are some of the big games coming out for PSP?

01:46:41.687 --> 01:46:45.289
[SPEAKER_22]: That's a good one.

01:46:45.309 --> 01:46:48.851
[SPEAKER_06]: Ooh, the gauntlet has been thrown in the chat room.

01:46:49.091 --> 01:46:49.611
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, what happened?

01:46:50.072 --> 01:46:51.392
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to label off my systems now.

01:46:51.792 --> 01:46:52.053
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, okay.

01:46:52.633 --> 01:46:53.313
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright, anyway.

01:46:55.434 --> 01:46:58.516
[SPEAKER_22]: Before you sell back your PSP, make sure it's something you're not going to regret later on with the games.

01:46:58.716 --> 01:47:01.838
[SPEAKER_22]: So, that's our really, really long-winded answer to your question.

01:47:01.878 --> 01:47:06.460
[SPEAKER_22]: I hope you're able to still listen, and sorry we had to let you go there, but we were just getting too much feedback.

01:47:06.560 --> 01:47:07.741
[SPEAKER_22]: Skype is being retarded today.

01:47:07.761 --> 01:47:09.382
[SPEAKER_22]: Skype is being very bad tonight, so...

01:47:09.482 --> 01:47:11.123
[SPEAKER_22]: Skype, Skype, I'm punishing Skype.

01:47:11.303 --> 01:47:13.244
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm not punishing our listeners, but I'm punishing Skype.

01:47:13.724 --> 01:47:16.226
[SPEAKER_22]: And we're going to sign into Do Not Disturb for a little while.

01:47:16.406 --> 01:47:17.286
[SPEAKER_22]: That was the last Skype word.

01:47:17.566 --> 01:47:17.747
[SPEAKER_22]: Huh?

01:47:20.468 --> 01:47:20.708
[SPEAKER_22]: All right.

01:47:21.409 --> 01:47:24.810
[SPEAKER_22]: So, again, if you want to give us feedback, you can always send us an email.

01:47:25.131 --> 01:47:28.472
[SPEAKER_22]: You can always join our chat room, and we always try to get to this stuff on the show.

01:47:28.873 --> 01:47:30.894
[SPEAKER_22]: www.orangeontrade.com, click on chat.

01:47:31.254 --> 01:47:34.396
[SPEAKER_22]: I'd really like to hear from this guy what he thought of our feedback there.

01:47:35.396 --> 01:47:36.257
[SPEAKER_22]: And, of course, our forums.

01:47:37.217 --> 01:47:43.241
[SPEAKER_22]: I know I've been searching those forums non-stop lately on OrangeLunchRadio.com, and there's been some pretty neat posts and some good questions asked.

01:47:43.601 --> 01:47:48.404
[SPEAKER_22]: And I, you know, if I'm bored, I always take time to state my opinion there on the forums.

01:47:48.844 --> 01:47:51.546
[SPEAKER_22]: So check that out as well on OrangeLunchRadio.com.

01:47:52.387 --> 01:47:52.647
[SPEAKER_22]: All right.

01:47:54.628 --> 01:47:59.871
[SPEAKER_22]: And some folks in the chat room are crying because they didn't get through on Skype line, so we're really sorry, but we are punishing Skype for a little while.

01:48:00.171 --> 01:48:02.773
[SPEAKER_22]: If we have some extra time at the end of the show, we'll come back to Skype, okay?

01:48:02.833 --> 01:48:03.273
[SPEAKER_22]: We promise.

01:48:03.774 --> 01:48:05.775
[SPEAKER_22]: But for now, we're long overdue for a break, you guys.

01:48:06.513 --> 01:48:12.921
[SPEAKER_22]: So we're going to go to a break, and in this break, I think we're going to play something from... Oh, I don't know.

01:48:12.961 --> 01:48:16.746
[SPEAKER_22]: How about an Outphase song from Beatmania 2DX?

01:48:16.766 --> 01:48:18.448
[SPEAKER_22]: I haven't heard this in a long time.

01:48:18.468 --> 01:48:21.232
[SPEAKER_22]: So we'll be back with more Orange Launch Radio after this, you guys.

01:48:21.612 --> 01:48:21.993
[SPEAKER_22]: Stay tuned.

01:50:05.626 --> 01:50:07.949
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for watching!

01:50:33.191 --> 01:50:35.845
Thank you for watching

01:51:17.349 --> 01:51:31.361
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't give away everything you own Someone will give you back the innocence that you have lost Charlie, if you're getting a sister of mine Better stay off the drugs and the wine Don't get lost in the day

01:52:04.232 --> 01:52:05.615

Thanks for watching!

01:55:54.148 --> 01:55:59.954
[SPEAKER_17]: Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

01:56:04.431 --> 01:56:06.492
[SPEAKER_22]: Hello, we're back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:56:06.532 --> 01:56:10.654
[SPEAKER_22]: In that break, you heard a little bit of Summer Vacation there from 2DX6Style.

01:56:11.214 --> 01:56:18.857
[SPEAKER_22]: Charlene from In The Groove, because, you know, a big part of that last segment, we were talking to an In The Groove fan who wanted to discuss with Jamie the pros and cons there.

01:56:19.377 --> 01:56:22.158
[SPEAKER_22]: And they said they liked Charlene, and a lot of our chatroom likes that song, too.

01:56:22.218 --> 01:56:24.999
[SPEAKER_22]: So we thought we'd nod those folks with that.

01:56:26.080 --> 01:56:29.781
[SPEAKER_22]: Also, V, as requested by our chatroom about a gazillion times there.

01:56:29.841 --> 01:56:33.663
[SPEAKER_22]: So there you go, some V. The perennially whored Bomani song.

01:56:34.864 --> 01:56:34.904
[SPEAKER_22]: D.R.

01:56:34.924 --> 01:56:36.006
[SPEAKER_22]: Max, America Max 2

01:56:48.134 --> 01:56:48.734
[SPEAKER_22]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

01:57:16.380 --> 01:57:20.301
[SPEAKER_22]: and of course now three of the four of us sitting in the room right now have been to E3 before.

01:57:20.401 --> 01:57:20.881
[SPEAKER_22]: Sorry, Bugs.

01:57:20.901 --> 01:57:21.842
[SPEAKER_22]: I plan on going this year.

01:57:22.102 --> 01:57:22.822
[SPEAKER_22]: Are you going to go this year?

01:57:23.482 --> 01:57:23.702
[SPEAKER_22]: Rad?

01:57:24.022 --> 01:57:24.703
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, Bug?

01:57:25.043 --> 01:57:25.583
[SPEAKER_22]: Get Bug to mic.

01:57:25.603 --> 01:57:28.104
[SPEAKER_16]: Give me the damn mic.

01:57:28.424 --> 01:57:29.444
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, I do plan on going this year.

01:57:29.504 --> 01:57:30.884
[SPEAKER_16]: My roommate has gone for the past four years.

01:57:31.044 --> 01:57:31.345
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, right on.

01:57:33.542 --> 01:57:34.422
[SPEAKER_16]: and many more.

01:57:49.108 --> 01:57:54.109
[SPEAKER_22]: I went for swag my first year And to give away to friends But going to sell is not cool

01:58:18.208 --> 01:58:21.310
[SPEAKER_06]: But last year it was all like, okay, I can't carry this crap around.

01:58:22.511 --> 01:58:28.995
[SPEAKER_06]: And my goal, my first goal, the first year I went was actually for media kits.

01:58:29.655 --> 01:58:36.340
[SPEAKER_06]: My second year was media kits and getting into media events, which I succeeded in.

01:58:36.880 --> 01:58:45.566
[SPEAKER_22]: Overpopulation, of course, my god, E3 was so crowded this year, it's not even funny, which of course ties back into the food lines, are god awful at E3.

01:58:50.267 --> 01:59:14.963
[SPEAKER_22]: I think next year somebody I had ways around that too somebody would be really smart to open up a hot dog stand out front like 50 of them or not just hot dog stands but permits how about a salad they were chasing off folks with hot dog stands because they didn't have permits for sale that is such BS actually it's law well I understand it's the law but come on you've got all those people packed in that tiny building and they're trying to eat for God's sake and to make them pay $10 for a hamburger is insane

01:59:15.743 --> 01:59:17.004
[SPEAKER_22]: So, shame on them.

01:59:18.284 --> 01:59:20.525
[SPEAKER_22]: Or at least somebody go get a permit then and make it legal.

01:59:21.326 --> 01:59:25.588
[SPEAKER_22]: How about instead of like hot dog carts, how about a salad cart or something healthy for these people?

01:59:26.368 --> 01:59:27.089
[SPEAKER_22]: Which includes me.

01:59:27.189 --> 01:59:27.849
[SPEAKER_22]: The fruit cart.

01:59:28.009 --> 01:59:28.569
[SPEAKER_22]: The fruit cart.

01:59:28.589 --> 01:59:29.430
[SPEAKER_22]: How about some hot fruit?

01:59:32.344 --> 01:59:35.166
[SPEAKER_22]: I can't be the only hot fruit at E3, come on.

01:59:36.146 --> 01:59:37.347
[SPEAKER_22]: Media, media, media.

01:59:37.667 --> 01:59:41.229
[SPEAKER_22]: Everything is all media-centric, which some argue is the way it needs to be.

01:59:41.369 --> 01:59:46.052
[SPEAKER_22]: Of course, the Rockstar booth this year was shit unless you were in the media.

01:59:46.733 --> 01:59:49.254
[SPEAKER_22]: You couldn't do anything at that booth unless you were media-oriented.

01:59:49.514 --> 01:59:52.416
[SPEAKER_22]: Some people say that one day of E3 needs to be nothing but media.

01:59:53.537 --> 01:59:55.938
[SPEAKER_22]: Be very interesting, nonetheless.

01:59:56.638 --> 01:59:58.219
[SPEAKER_22]: Sexploitation of E3.

01:59:59.500 --> 02:00:04.444
[SPEAKER_22]: The fact that it's booth babes, booth babes, booth babes, and then just random girls walking around.

02:00:04.464 --> 02:00:05.745
[SPEAKER_22]: Look at this place.

02:00:05.945 --> 02:00:06.165
[SPEAKER_22]: Nope.

02:00:06.386 --> 02:00:07.787
[SPEAKER_22]: Very, very few booth boys.

02:00:07.827 --> 02:00:08.287
[SPEAKER_22]: There's one.

02:00:08.948 --> 02:00:09.428
[SPEAKER_22]: Very few.

02:00:09.508 --> 02:00:10.789
[SPEAKER_22]: Just at the Barbarians.

02:00:10.829 --> 02:00:11.410
[SPEAKER_22]: It was great.

02:00:12.010 --> 02:00:13.111
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, let's face it, though.

02:00:13.251 --> 02:00:17.895
[SPEAKER_22]: The statistics are that, you know, most of the E3... The Bacon Dogs were awesome.

02:00:18.616 --> 02:00:20.397
[SPEAKER_22]: Most of the... That was a random comment.

02:00:20.937 --> 02:00:24.540
[SPEAKER_22]: Most of the E3 is very male-dominated.

02:00:24.560 --> 02:00:26.942
[SPEAKER_22]: But at the same time, I see a lot, a lot more women.

02:00:26.962 --> 02:00:28.844
[SPEAKER_22]: There's more women that go to that show than you'd think.

02:00:30.097 --> 02:00:34.642
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, so I'm kind of surprised they don't have more booth dudes, or whatever you want to call them, booth hunks.

02:00:34.822 --> 02:00:36.223
[SPEAKER_06]: I got interviewed by IGN.

02:00:36.764 --> 02:00:36.984
[SPEAKER_22]: What?

02:00:37.104 --> 02:00:38.385
[SPEAKER_22]: I got interviewed by IGN.

02:00:39.046 --> 02:00:40.087
[SPEAKER_22]: As like a gamer girl, right?

02:00:40.107 --> 02:00:40.928
[SPEAKER_22]: As a gamer girl.

02:00:40.968 --> 02:00:41.148
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

02:00:41.168 --> 02:00:46.253
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, do you consider yourself a gamer girl?

02:00:46.774 --> 02:00:49.657
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I only host internet radio about video games.

02:00:52.045 --> 02:00:53.767
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm sorry, you're not a true gaming girl.

02:00:53.787 --> 02:00:57.691
[SPEAKER_22]: You have not licked a PSP.

02:00:57.711 --> 02:01:01.316
[SPEAKER_06]: I am older school than old school.

02:01:03.418 --> 02:01:06.742
[SPEAKER_22]: People that camp and play the demos all day long.

02:01:08.479 --> 02:01:12.322
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, I realize this, but I'm talking about the one particular demo.

02:01:13.143 --> 02:01:19.067
[SPEAKER_22]: What's a game that people were doing this on at this year's E3 that people would just not get off those damn demos no matter what?

02:01:19.688 --> 02:01:21.269
[SPEAKER_22]: Not really so much Katamari, actually.

02:01:21.649 --> 02:01:24.552
[SPEAKER_22]: The way the Katamari demo was set up, it was very hard to camp that demo.

02:01:25.212 --> 02:01:27.914
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm trying to think of a demo that was really badly camped.

02:01:28.315 --> 02:01:30.797
[SPEAKER_22]: Soul Calibur III was pretty bad.

02:01:31.977 --> 02:01:32.558
[SPEAKER_22]: So, I don't know.

02:01:32.578 --> 02:01:33.659
[SPEAKER_22]: There's other ones, too.

02:01:34.082 --> 02:01:44.025
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, in the year before that, I would say probably Contra, the Contra game, and... Oh, I don't even remember the other one now.

02:01:46.666 --> 02:01:52.568
[SPEAKER_16]: Cattle Pods and Timed Electrical Pulses will... Although some people might get to like that.

02:01:53.008 --> 02:01:57.130
[SPEAKER_22]: Shuttle Delays, so it makes it very hard to get to the damn show, I agree with that one.

02:01:57.930 --> 02:01:58.030
[SPEAKER_22]: Um...

02:01:59.366 --> 02:02:02.868
[SPEAKER_22]: The sound, the fact that the sound is very, very loud there.

02:02:04.109 --> 02:02:05.890
[SPEAKER_22]: Have you ever been to any other type of conference?

02:02:05.910 --> 02:02:07.971
[SPEAKER_06]: I got to touch the Katamari and that made me happy.

02:02:08.672 --> 02:02:15.476
[SPEAKER_22]: The fact that the lines are incredibly long and you never really necessarily know what they're for in some cases.

02:02:17.777 --> 02:02:20.939
[SPEAKER_22]: And sometimes the lines are to just walk through a room.

02:02:21.479 --> 02:02:25.762
[SPEAKER_22]: The article says, The line at Nintendo is for a screening at Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess.

02:02:26.102 --> 02:02:28.784
[SPEAKER_22]: They'd just shown the trailer at the press conference the day before.

02:02:30.148 --> 02:02:41.013
[SPEAKER_22]: and then the line at Sony was to walk through a room where they had hallow models of the PlayStation 3 design behind glass two days before they'd released high-res images of the system anyway.

02:02:41.113 --> 02:02:42.534
[SPEAKER_22]: Were you supposed to kneel down in reverence?

02:02:43.394 --> 02:02:48.476
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, I'm not going to say anything because we had those pictures up as soon as we were back.

02:02:50.297 --> 02:02:57.580
[SPEAKER_22]: Here's their suggestions, and then we'll wrap this up and get into other segments here because I know maybe some people are like, well, what the hell do I care?

02:02:57.620 --> 02:02:58.301
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't get to go to E3.

02:02:58.321 --> 02:02:58.381
[SPEAKER_22]: Huh?

02:02:59.944 --> 02:03:02.005
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, we'll get to that.

02:03:03.366 --> 02:03:04.947
[SPEAKER_22]: Suggestions on how to make E3 better.

02:03:05.267 --> 02:03:06.988
[SPEAKER_22]: Tighten the entrance requirements.

02:03:09.389 --> 02:03:13.491
[SPEAKER_22]: It's saying if you work at a Hollywood video store, you shouldn't be coming in.

02:03:13.591 --> 02:03:16.492
[SPEAKER_22]: If you draw an online comic strip, you shouldn't be coming in.

02:03:16.552 --> 02:03:22.035
[SPEAKER_22]: If you're from blogger.com and you occasionally talk about games, you shouldn't be coming in.

02:03:23.573 --> 02:03:32.781
[SPEAKER_22]: If you just really want to get into E3 because you want to play upcoming games, you're part of the problem, says this site, article.gaminghorizon.com.

02:03:33.081 --> 02:03:34.922
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm not sure if that's the best way to phrase it.

02:03:35.903 --> 02:03:41.508
[SPEAKER_22]: If you work at Target in the garden department, just because Target carries games, you shouldn't be going to E3.

02:03:41.548 --> 02:03:48.233
[SPEAKER_22]: I think you have to play the upcoming games so you can tell other people about them, so yes, that is part of the reason why you play, but anyway.

02:03:49.695 --> 02:03:50.976
[SPEAKER_22]: A Media Only Day...

02:03:51.792 --> 02:03:52.833
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know if that's the answer.

02:03:53.053 --> 02:03:55.014
[SPEAKER_22]: I think the media gets too much favoritism as it is.

02:03:55.134 --> 02:03:57.635
[SPEAKER_22]: If they would just tighten up who they let in in general.

02:03:57.835 --> 02:04:02.718
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but the media, the hype that the media generates is part of what sells the games.

02:04:03.078 --> 02:04:11.483
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand that, but I just... Part of what... True, you've got to cater to the fan base, but it is a media event.

02:04:11.743 --> 02:04:12.923
[SPEAKER_06]: It is an industry event.

02:04:12.983 --> 02:04:14.444
[SPEAKER_22]: It's an industry event, not a media event.

02:04:14.464 --> 02:04:15.024
[SPEAKER_22]: There's a difference.

02:04:15.385 --> 02:04:16.145
[SPEAKER_22]: It's an industry event.

02:04:16.165 --> 02:04:17.746
[SPEAKER_06]: But I do think the media should get a difference.

02:04:18.851 --> 02:04:20.632
[SPEAKER_06]: They're the ones who are actually reporting on it.

02:04:20.692 --> 02:04:24.294
[SPEAKER_06]: They should be getting the information before the average consumer.

02:04:24.634 --> 02:04:26.735
[SPEAKER_22]: What about like a manager of a GameStop who's not the media?

02:04:27.895 --> 02:04:29.356
[SPEAKER_06]: Then they need to be shown some credentials.

02:04:29.416 --> 02:04:30.957
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that they should get into that too.

02:04:31.357 --> 02:04:40.781
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm saying the average GameStop employee, the average Target employee, the people who do a webcomic.

02:04:41.342 --> 02:04:46.464
[SPEAKER_06]: I think if you report on it or if you are in charge of a group that is selling it,

02:04:48.015 --> 02:04:50.097
[SPEAKER_06]: Less babes, more games Streamline the press conferences

02:05:07.197 --> 02:05:17.544
[SPEAKER_22]: The one thing about the press they were saying is no love for the small press like us because G4 and IGN bring like 5,000 people to those things.

02:05:17.684 --> 02:05:18.925
[SPEAKER_22]: They whore out everything.

02:05:19.165 --> 02:05:29.452
[SPEAKER_22]: It's like Joe Bob who actually has a website that's pretty popular but not as popular as these can't get into anything because they're being whored out.

02:05:29.632 --> 02:05:30.473
[SPEAKER_22]: It's like, who are you?

02:05:30.793 --> 02:05:33.155
[SPEAKER_22]: We don't know who you are so fuck off, you know.

02:05:34.336 --> 02:05:37.798
[SPEAKER_22]: and no behind closed doors only content.

02:05:38.178 --> 02:05:39.078
[SPEAKER_22]: I have to agree with that one.

02:05:39.098 --> 02:05:39.338
[SPEAKER_22]: I agree.

02:05:39.358 --> 02:05:42.400
[SPEAKER_22]: That's a bunch of crap, keeping the stuff behind closed doors.

02:05:42.440 --> 02:05:46.941
[SPEAKER_22]: Just don't show it at all.

02:05:47.562 --> 02:05:49.262
[SPEAKER_22]: Fix the demo camper problem.

02:05:50.003 --> 02:05:53.944
[SPEAKER_22]: I'd just have those demos reset after like three minutes or say, time's up, get off my game.

02:05:55.265 --> 02:05:56.305
[SPEAKER_22]: Watch the volume.

02:05:57.066 --> 02:05:59.607
[SPEAKER_22]: Figure out what's secret and what's public.

02:06:00.529 --> 02:06:03.951
[SPEAKER_22]: have operational press sites running alongside the show.

02:06:04.251 --> 02:06:04.952
[SPEAKER_22]: That's kind of interesting.

02:06:05.472 --> 02:06:08.834
[SPEAKER_22]: And the last one, which I think is very interesting, have an East Coast show.

02:06:10.675 --> 02:06:10.835
[SPEAKER_22]: No.

02:06:11.896 --> 02:06:17.799
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, I thought that Microsoft did their Xbox 360 demo very intelligently.

02:06:18.059 --> 02:06:18.760
[SPEAKER_06]: They had a ticket.

02:06:19.921 --> 02:06:23.182
[SPEAKER_06]: You go up, get your ticket, you come back at the time for the ticket, and they let you in.

02:06:23.222 --> 02:06:24.103
[SPEAKER_22]: That's a Squeenix thing.

02:06:25.024 --> 02:06:27.005
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that was pretty smart, too.

02:06:27.245 --> 02:06:28.125
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I think it was very...

02:06:29.306 --> 02:06:34.807
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, although you do have to wait for your turn, but it prevents them from being the insane line.

02:06:35.107 --> 02:06:40.769
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, it did actually prevent the line at Squinnix, but it did prevent the lines for the 360.

02:06:42.129 --> 02:06:45.069
[SPEAKER_06]: You had your line formed at the time it was to let them in.

02:06:45.490 --> 02:06:47.370
[SPEAKER_06]: You get inside, no more line.

02:06:47.390 --> 02:06:49.250
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't have to worry about the congestion of people.

02:06:49.370 --> 02:06:50.251
[SPEAKER_06]: It was very smart.

02:06:51.051 --> 02:06:56.072
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I even think that they should have, this is like what they do with Anime Expo.

02:06:56.872 --> 02:07:07.894
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, if you're staying in the convention center hotels or the ones associated with the convention, then as part of, you know, you can go pick up a ticket when you prove that you're staying at one of these places.

02:07:08.514 --> 02:07:15.116
[SPEAKER_06]: Or, you know, because that will, you know, generate a little bit more money for both the hotel and, you know, and for the convention itself.

02:07:15.956 --> 02:07:25.098
[SPEAKER_06]: But it also prevents, you know, there from being huge congested amounts of people if you have your ticket sales done in a more out of the way location.

02:07:26.709 --> 02:07:29.910
[SPEAKER_22]: A lot of our chat room is really big on the East Coast idea.

02:07:30.090 --> 02:07:40.112
[SPEAKER_22]: I think because of E3 getting overcrowded and over-bloated in a way, I think some of these East Coast shows are starting to pick up the slack a little bit, just naturally.

02:07:40.312 --> 02:07:45.693
[SPEAKER_22]: People are calling this digital live show that's coming up the East Coast E3, and that's just kind of a natural evolution.

02:07:45.773 --> 02:07:52.215
[SPEAKER_16]: There are very few, as far as I can know, there aren't as many game companies out on the East Coast as there are on the West Coast.

02:07:53.035 --> 02:07:53.515
[SPEAKER_22]: That's very true.

02:07:54.151 --> 02:07:58.935
[SPEAKER_16]: and it's significantly easier for, you know, basically L.A.

02:07:58.975 --> 02:08:02.839
[SPEAKER_16]: is a local show for everyone in... But most of them are in the bay.

02:08:02.919 --> 02:08:04.320
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, I guess maybe not.

02:08:04.400 --> 02:08:05.821
[SPEAKER_16]: It's still only four hours.

02:08:05.861 --> 02:08:08.944
[SPEAKER_16]: That's better than four days of having to transport stuff.

02:08:09.004 --> 02:08:12.207
[SPEAKER_16]: Four hours, you know, you can go home for a day, you know, if you fly.

02:08:12.787 --> 02:08:15.329
[SPEAKER_16]: You can go down and up every morning if you have to.

02:08:17.111 --> 02:08:18.852
[SPEAKER_22]: All right, we're going to move on real quick.

02:08:20.052 --> 02:08:20.433
[SPEAKER_22]: DarkSakura

02:08:47.148 --> 02:08:47.468
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

02:08:48.409 --> 02:08:50.591
[SPEAKER_22]: More food vendors is my thing.

02:08:50.631 --> 02:08:51.231
[SPEAKER_22]: More food vendors.

02:08:51.271 --> 02:08:55.514
[SPEAKER_22]: That is stupid that I'm losing an hour and a half of playing game time because I'm standing in line for food.

02:08:55.575 --> 02:08:56.155
[SPEAKER_22]: That's awful.

02:08:56.455 --> 02:08:59.317
[SPEAKER_06]: I seriously need to stop being run into by famous people.

02:09:00.678 --> 02:09:01.839
[SPEAKER_16]: And closed door stuff should not.

02:09:02.500 --> 02:09:02.620
[SPEAKER_16]: No.

02:09:02.760 --> 02:09:03.901
[SPEAKER_16]: That's not the reason you're there.

02:09:03.961 --> 02:09:05.902
[SPEAKER_16]: You're there to show stuff, not show stuff.

02:09:06.623 --> 02:09:10.546
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's just to build the excitement about it by making it some secret deal.

02:09:10.706 --> 02:09:12.988
[SPEAKER_22]: The biggest problem with E3 is they let Sinbad in.

02:09:13.786 --> 02:09:14.448
[SPEAKER_22]: and Gary Coleman.

02:09:14.508 --> 02:09:17.757
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, John Cena was there last year and he's pretty hot.

02:09:18.679 --> 02:09:22.008
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright kids, we're going to get into the Orange Lounge Radio cage match or we're going to run out of time.

02:09:23.697 --> 02:09:26.538
[SPEAKER_22]: The way the cage match works is that we play three songs for you guys.

02:09:26.578 --> 02:09:31.720
[SPEAKER_22]: We play a clip of the song that won last week and then two new songs, each host, of course, bringing one song to the table.

02:09:32.160 --> 02:09:33.400
[SPEAKER_22]: You guys vote on your favorite.

02:09:33.440 --> 02:09:40.963
[SPEAKER_22]: The winning song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's Bomani and video game music program, which plays 24 hours a day, seven days a week on the station.

02:09:41.043 --> 02:09:42.203
[SPEAKER_22]: We are not live.

02:09:42.663 --> 02:09:47.205
[SPEAKER_22]: Starting it off tonight is last week's winner, now going for its third win, I believe, if I'm not mistaking.

02:09:48.165 --> 02:09:49.806
[SPEAKER_22]: It's something Loki picked a while back.

02:09:49.906 --> 02:09:52.867
[SPEAKER_22]: It's a remix of V by Doresia.

02:09:53.547 --> 02:09:54.207
[SPEAKER_22]: is the artist.

02:09:54.588 --> 02:09:56.128
[SPEAKER_22]: So it's won for the past two weeks.

02:09:56.188 --> 02:09:57.229
[SPEAKER_22]: Will it win again tonight?

02:09:57.729 --> 02:09:58.930
[SPEAKER_22]: I just don't know.

02:09:58.990 --> 02:09:59.770
[SPEAKER_22]: We'll find out.

02:10:00.490 --> 02:10:03.632
[SPEAKER_22]: Here it is, song number one tonight, a clip of last week's winner, V.

02:11:43.308 --> 02:11:48.891
[SPEAKER_22]: I turned the mics back on right as you yawned, which was... I didn't have... I was... I was asleep.

02:11:48.951 --> 02:11:51.272
[SPEAKER_22]: You're cutting out... I don't know what the hell's wrong with the cord there.

02:11:51.312 --> 02:11:51.652
[SPEAKER_06]: Yo!

02:11:51.772 --> 02:11:52.132
[SPEAKER_22]: There you are.

02:11:52.432 --> 02:11:52.672
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright.

02:11:53.373 --> 02:11:55.834
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just... I was just being lulled to sleep.

02:11:56.054 --> 02:11:59.535
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright, that was song one, Doresio with V. Will it win for the third week in a row?

02:11:59.555 --> 02:12:00.116
[SPEAKER_22]: We'll find out.

02:12:00.176 --> 02:12:02.757
[SPEAKER_22]: Two new songs doing... challenging it tonight.

02:12:03.357 --> 02:12:09.440
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, the first one is my pick, and, um... I haven't won the cage match in, like, three months.

02:12:10.519 --> 02:12:10.999
[SPEAKER_22]: Seriously.

02:12:12.420 --> 02:12:13.721
[SPEAKER_22]: I have not won the cage match in three months.

02:12:14.021 --> 02:12:16.282
[SPEAKER_22]: So I decided tonight I just wasn't going to pick a song.

02:12:16.642 --> 02:12:18.423
[SPEAKER_22]: So I let somebody else pick a song for me.

02:12:19.924 --> 02:12:24.646
[SPEAKER_22]: And Miklatov's been begging and begging me for like two months or something to let him put a song in.

02:12:24.686 --> 02:12:25.446
[SPEAKER_22]: So here you go.

02:12:25.846 --> 02:12:29.828
[SPEAKER_22]: And I swear to God, Miklatov, if this song loses, you never get another one in here.

02:12:29.868 --> 02:12:30.508
[SPEAKER_22]: No, I'm just kidding.

02:12:31.189 --> 02:12:31.789
[SPEAKER_22]: But here it is.

02:12:32.770 --> 02:12:35.011
[SPEAKER_22]: This is a song by a group called Pendulum.

02:12:35.631 --> 02:12:37.412
[SPEAKER_22]: And the song is called Hold Your Color.

02:12:38.172 --> 02:12:39.473
[SPEAKER_22]: So we'll see what you guys think.

02:12:39.533 --> 02:12:40.494
[SPEAKER_22]: Here it is, song number two.

02:12:42.515 --> 02:12:46.919
So can't forget So can't forget So can't forget So can't forget

02:13:08.237 --> 02:13:09.098
Thanks for watching!

02:13:09.118 --> 02:13:10.279
Subscribe for more!

02:16:03.579 --> 02:16:04.600
Thanks for watching!

02:18:09.104 --> 02:18:12.006
[SPEAKER_22]: Song number two in tonight's cage match, Pendulum, Hold Your Color.

02:18:13.087 --> 02:18:14.789
[SPEAKER_22]: We're not going to hold back our thoughts any longer.

02:18:14.829 --> 02:18:16.270
[SPEAKER_22]: What do you guys think of that, DarkSakura?

02:18:17.769 --> 02:18:20.391
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I like it a lot.

02:18:21.152 --> 02:18:26.575
[SPEAKER_06]: I just felt it was a little long and got a little repetitive, but I really do like the song a lot, so it gets an 8.5.

02:18:27.296 --> 02:18:27.636
[SPEAKER_22]: Loki.

02:18:27.936 --> 02:18:33.400
[SPEAKER_20]: I like the beginning of it, then it just kind of, I don't know, it dropped off in my interest, I guess.

02:18:34.281 --> 02:18:34.781
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, so 9.

02:18:36.262 --> 02:18:36.682
[SPEAKER_22]: Bugged.

02:18:38.463 --> 02:18:39.204
[SPEAKER_22]: Good driving song.

02:18:40.385 --> 02:18:40.605
[SPEAKER_16]: About an 8.

02:18:41.970 --> 02:18:42.991
[SPEAKER_22]: DarkSakura, which pick first tonight?

02:19:07.515 --> 02:19:10.136
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, it's, uh, off the new Enflo album.

02:19:11.296 --> 02:19:13.857
[SPEAKER_06]: It's, uh, Enflo Loves Benny K's Taste Your Stuff.

02:19:15.277 --> 02:19:16.417
[SPEAKER_22]: Some Enflo tonight.

02:19:16.437 --> 02:19:17.437
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep, new Enflo.

02:19:17.537 --> 02:19:18.538
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright, new Enflo.

02:19:19.418 --> 02:19:20.398
[SPEAKER_22]: Song number three tonight.

02:19:20.958 --> 02:19:24.819
[SPEAKER_22]: DarkSakura's pick, Enflo Loves Benny K with Taste Your Stuff.

02:19:35.515 --> 02:19:42.660
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, nobody else Hey, nobody else

02:20:43.905 --> 02:20:44.747
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for watching!

02:21:55.467 --> 02:21:56.268
[SPEAKER_08]: Akihito, Akihito

02:22:22.766 --> 02:22:24.127
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for watching!

02:23:14.256 --> 02:23:32.283
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, that was song number three in tonight's cage match.

02:23:32.503 --> 02:23:35.824
[SPEAKER_22]: Mflow loves Benny K with Taste Your Stuff.

02:23:36.304 --> 02:23:37.845
[SPEAKER_22]: Very interesting name for a song there.

02:23:38.868 --> 02:23:41.730
[SPEAKER_22]: So let's see, uh, did that leave a good taste or a bad taste in your mouth?

02:23:41.770 --> 02:23:42.431
[SPEAKER_22]: DarkSakura?

02:23:42.691 --> 02:23:44.052
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm broken, do no wrong, 10.

02:23:44.872 --> 02:23:45.232
[SPEAKER_22]: Loki?

02:23:45.433 --> 02:23:46.854
[SPEAKER_22]: Were they talking about snowballing?

02:23:47.494 --> 02:23:48.114
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't think so.

02:23:48.535 --> 02:23:51.017
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, um, I think it's an 8.

02:23:51.497 --> 02:23:53.578
[SPEAKER_22]: I was, they lost me at the meowing.

02:23:54.699 --> 02:23:54.999
[SPEAKER_22]: Bugged.

02:23:56.320 --> 02:23:57.041
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, same thing.

02:23:57.761 --> 02:23:58.141
[SPEAKER_16]: Yelling.

02:23:58.242 --> 02:23:58.642
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright.

02:23:59.422 --> 02:24:00.603
[SPEAKER_22]: I liked it, it was kind of cool.

02:24:01.563 --> 02:24:06.106
[SPEAKER_22]: It's weird because whenever I decide to randomly download and upload, I get a really shitty song.

02:24:06.406 --> 02:24:10.989
[SPEAKER_22]: Whenever she picks one for Cage Match, it's actually really good and I like them, so go figure.

02:24:11.389 --> 02:24:13.190
[SPEAKER_22]: So I like that song, it was cool.

02:24:13.250 --> 02:24:15.571
[SPEAKER_22]: It had like a porno beat to it, which was kind of cool.

02:24:15.912 --> 02:24:19.614
[SPEAKER_22]: So I give it like an 8.5, maybe 9.

02:24:20.554 --> 02:24:21.775
[SPEAKER_22]: I could be talked into a 9.

02:24:21.815 --> 02:24:22.375
[SPEAKER_22]: 8.5 though for now.

02:24:24.079 --> 02:24:26.780
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright, let's recap the three songs you can vote for tonight.

02:24:27.241 --> 02:24:42.109
[SPEAKER_22]: Starting off with song number one is Doresia with The... And song number two you can vote for tonight is Pendulum with Hold Your Color.

02:24:50.749 --> 02:24:55.653
[SPEAKER_22]: And song number three you can vote for tonight is Mflow Loves Benny K with Taste Your Stuff.

02:24:55.673 --> 02:24:58.556
[SPEAKER_22]: Whoa, that's not it.

02:24:59.337 --> 02:24:59.817
[SPEAKER_22]: How about this?

02:25:00.177 --> 02:25:01.078
[SPEAKER_22]: Let's try this again.

02:25:01.218 --> 02:25:02.980
[SPEAKER_22]: Mflow Loves Benny K with Taste Your Stuff.

02:25:11.637 --> 02:25:13.317
[SPEAKER_22]: All right, kids, you know what to do.

02:25:13.738 --> 02:25:16.158
[SPEAKER_22]: Place vote now.

02:25:16.258 --> 02:25:19.999
[SPEAKER_22]: Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.

02:25:20.379 --> 02:25:31.661
[SPEAKER_22]: Remember, screaming and hollering in the chat room will not count as a vote, although, you know, you may sway some other people, but I'm not encouraging you people to start flooding the chat room.

02:25:31.881 --> 02:25:33.601
[SPEAKER_22]: No flooding.

02:25:34.421 --> 02:25:38.962
[SPEAKER_22]: You have to allow them to campaign for a song they might want, but, you know, no flooding.

02:25:39.673 --> 02:25:41.115
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, the next person who floods me.

02:25:41.155 --> 02:25:42.036
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, don't flood.

02:25:42.737 --> 02:25:43.758
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright, so there you go.

02:25:43.798 --> 02:25:46.020
[SPEAKER_22]: Have fun arguing about that.

02:25:46.561 --> 02:25:51.267
[SPEAKER_22]: In the meantime, Loki, I'm really curious to hear what's going on in the sim scene.

02:25:51.287 --> 02:25:52.508
[SPEAKER_22]: Setmania 3.9, release candidate 4.

02:25:52.548 --> 02:25:52.808
[SPEAKER_22]: That's it.

02:25:55.987 --> 02:25:56.387
[SPEAKER_22]: That's it?

02:25:56.567 --> 02:25:56.887
[SPEAKER_20]: That's it.

02:25:57.128 --> 02:25:59.088
[SPEAKER_22]: God damn the Sims team for being slow lately.

02:25:59.109 --> 02:26:00.569
[SPEAKER_22]: They really haven't been doing anything lately.

02:26:01.190 --> 02:26:01.990
[SPEAKER_20]: Get up off your asses, people.

02:26:02.010 --> 02:26:03.270
[SPEAKER_20]: Everybody's on vacation.

02:26:03.731 --> 02:26:04.931
[SPEAKER_22]: They're getting... Vacation?

02:26:05.011 --> 02:26:06.372
[SPEAKER_22]: It's early October.

02:26:06.692 --> 02:26:07.152
[SPEAKER_22]: What are they doing?

02:26:07.192 --> 02:26:08.633
[SPEAKER_22]: Going on vacation for Columbus Day?

02:26:08.673 --> 02:26:09.894
[SPEAKER_22]: How do I go on vacation?

02:26:10.634 --> 02:26:11.074
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know.

02:26:12.515 --> 02:26:21.519
[SPEAKER_22]: All I know is that that release candidate's coming out, and they're promising Set Mania 4 someday, and I think I lost interest, like, what, three years ago when they were on release candidate 3?

02:26:21.559 --> 02:26:21.779
[SPEAKER_22]: So, um...

02:26:23.877 --> 02:26:50.184
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, anyways, um, no, nothing really going on, um, was it, OSC 4, um, the other step file, uh, contest they are in judging right now, and, yeah, and, um, I don't know, oh, I know, um, I was gonna see if, um, the, was it, uh,

02:26:51.854 --> 02:26:52.735
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you for watching!

02:27:09.119 --> 02:27:13.360
[SPEAKER_22]: It's down to the final 10, well, 11 actually.

02:27:13.660 --> 02:27:15.781
[SPEAKER_22]: How many remixes of 2DX songs are in there?

02:27:16.721 --> 02:27:20.222
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, here's the finalists in no particular order.

02:27:20.562 --> 02:27:21.702
[SPEAKER_22]: Curious what songs people choose.

02:27:21.722 --> 02:27:28.164
[SPEAKER_22]: Din Dan Don, Speed Mix, Lucky Cha Cha Cha, Heaven is a Place on Earth, the Speedo Mix.

02:27:28.424 --> 02:27:30.344
[SPEAKER_22]: Isn't Ding Dang Dong a Smile Decay song?

02:27:30.504 --> 02:27:30.824
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know.

02:27:30.864 --> 02:27:31.925
[SPEAKER_06]: That last one is Wild Side.

02:27:33.325 --> 02:27:37.906
[SPEAKER_22]: Canned Heat by Jamiroquai, Unbalance, Country Roads,

02:27:39.293 --> 02:27:46.065
[SPEAKER_22]: Take On Me, Speedo Mix, Bye Bye Bike, Boys and Girls Mix, and Not For Sale.

02:27:50.288 --> 02:27:58.115
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, hooray for you people not- All of which, I might add, they said who made them, so no unbiased judging there.

02:27:59.136 --> 02:28:02.900
[SPEAKER_22]: My hat's off, though, for not picking Bomani songs and making steps for them.

02:28:02.980 --> 02:28:07.064
[SPEAKER_22]: I think you got bumped down if you did something like that or something.

02:28:07.084 --> 02:28:08.585
[SPEAKER_22]: Good, good, because I was sick of seeing those.

02:28:09.666 --> 02:28:12.248
[SPEAKER_22]: Although it sounds like a bunch of Dance Mania speed songs are in there.

02:28:13.550 --> 02:28:14.591
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh well, what can you do?

02:28:17.135 --> 02:28:19.998
[SPEAKER_22]: And of course I'm getting corrected in the chatroom, it's not a SmileDK song.

02:28:20.038 --> 02:28:21.519
[SPEAKER_22]: Where the hell have I heard that name before?

02:28:22.720 --> 02:28:23.320
[SPEAKER_22]: Ding dang dong.

02:28:23.380 --> 02:28:24.701
[SPEAKER_22]: I know I've heard that song name before.

02:28:25.682 --> 02:28:27.784
[SPEAKER_22]: Like, it's on a Dance Mania CD, I can swear.

02:28:29.266 --> 02:28:30.486
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh well.

02:28:30.646 --> 02:28:31.027
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't care.

02:28:32.067 --> 02:28:32.687
[SPEAKER_22]: Ugly looking.

02:28:33.087 --> 02:28:33.387
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright.

02:28:34.808 --> 02:28:37.709
[SPEAKER_22]: I wanted to play this- I feel like I'm going to a Taika Parade all of a sudden.

02:28:38.429 --> 02:28:39.509
[SPEAKER_22]: I know, he's still at it.

02:28:39.649 --> 02:28:41.250
[SPEAKER_22]: Extaper is still playing Taika.

02:28:41.390 --> 02:28:42.010
[SPEAKER_22]: You know what's funny?

02:28:42.450 --> 02:28:44.591
[SPEAKER_22]: He bought the game at like 5 o'clock today, okay?

02:28:44.951 --> 02:28:51.533
[SPEAKER_22]: He already has told me he's beat the game on easy, which means he's played every song in the game on easy mode now, and now he's going back through on normal mode.

02:28:51.633 --> 02:28:51.853
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

02:28:54.144 --> 02:28:55.865
[SPEAKER_22]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

02:29:23.919 --> 02:29:25.920
[SPEAKER_22]: I swear to god she says fuck me

02:29:51.653 --> 02:29:55.954
[SPEAKER_22]: So we're going to listen right now to a little bit of acapella here, Sana, Injection of Love.

02:29:56.914 --> 02:30:15.257
[SPEAKER_13]: So you can actually kind of hear the little thuds there in the background, so let's see if we can get into the... You can hear little bits of the music in there because the cancellation is not perfect.

02:30:20.902 --> 02:30:22.963
[SPEAKER_22]: It sounds like playing a record backwards, doesn't it?

02:30:24.403 --> 02:30:38.327
[SPEAKER_13]: Here it is.

02:30:38.907 --> 02:30:43.548
[SPEAKER_22]: When you hear it like that, it doesn't sound like fuck so much, but it definitely sounds like froak me.

02:30:45.615 --> 02:30:46.996
[SPEAKER_06]: Gently stroke me.

02:30:47.336 --> 02:30:47.456
[SPEAKER_06]: Me.

02:30:47.476 --> 02:30:47.556
[SPEAKER_06]: Me.

02:30:47.596 --> 02:30:47.696
[SPEAKER_06]: Me.

02:30:47.736 --> 02:30:47.776
[SPEAKER_06]: Me.

02:30:47.796 --> 02:30:47.856
[SPEAKER_06]: Me.

02:30:47.876 --> 02:30:47.956
[SPEAKER_22]: Me.

02:30:47.996 --> 02:30:48.056
[SPEAKER_22]: Me.

02:30:48.076 --> 02:30:48.116
[SPEAKER_22]: Me.

02:30:48.136 --> 02:30:48.176
[SPEAKER_22]: Me.

02:30:48.197 --> 02:30:48.237
[SPEAKER_22]: Me.

02:31:11.826 --> 02:31:12.406
[SPEAKER_06]: Think about this.

02:31:13.467 --> 02:31:26.234
[SPEAKER_06]: If it were written out in Karakana, it would be So try saying really fast and see how it comes out.

02:31:28.475 --> 02:31:29.056
[SPEAKER_22]: Fuck me!

02:31:30.748 --> 02:31:31.488
[SPEAKER_22]: Wow, you're right.

02:31:31.809 --> 02:31:32.129
[SPEAKER_06]: Amazing.

02:31:32.149 --> 02:31:42.554
[SPEAKER_06]: But seriously, if you listen to that part again and listen to it as if the whole STR little cluster there is actually three syllables.

02:31:44.215 --> 02:31:45.776
[SPEAKER_04]: What is there to stroke on her?

02:31:46.957 --> 02:31:47.777
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe her breast.

02:31:49.058 --> 02:31:50.479
[SPEAKER_06]: She wants it gently, whatever.

02:31:52.210 --> 02:31:52.570
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

02:31:53.150 --> 02:31:56.372
[SPEAKER_04]: Froak you, and froak you, and froak you too.

02:31:56.412 --> 02:31:57.512
[SPEAKER_22]: Does she have a penis?

02:31:57.772 --> 02:31:59.933
[SPEAKER_22]: No, I mean, as far as I know, no.

02:32:00.914 --> 02:32:02.775
[SPEAKER_22]: Can you stroke a vagina, Loki?

02:32:02.795 --> 02:32:04.815
[SPEAKER_22]: You could, oh god, please don't.

02:32:04.915 --> 02:32:06.156
[SPEAKER_22]: You can't really do that.

02:32:06.536 --> 02:32:10.078
[SPEAKER_22]: Unless there's some really abnormalities, we're not going to go there.

02:32:10.458 --> 02:32:12.679
[SPEAKER_22]: But, um, yeah.

02:32:13.319 --> 02:32:15.280
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't think so.

02:32:15.954 --> 02:32:21.078
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

02:32:21.659 --> 02:32:24.401
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't the Clitoris like just another version of a penis?

02:32:24.421 --> 02:32:25.082
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

02:32:26.183 --> 02:32:26.623
[SPEAKER_04]: Never mind.

02:32:27.884 --> 02:32:29.545
[SPEAKER_22]: I'll just let that thought answer.

02:32:29.685 --> 02:32:30.606
[SPEAKER_22]: This is why you're gay.

02:32:30.726 --> 02:32:32.388
[SPEAKER_22]: Just stay gay.

02:32:33.048 --> 02:32:33.508
[SPEAKER_22]: Stay gay.

02:32:33.749 --> 02:32:37.592
[SPEAKER_22]: Don't try to do things that are outside your... Curiosity is bad.

02:32:37.992 --> 02:32:40.374
[SPEAKER_06]: Curiosity led to the founding of countries.

02:32:40.694 --> 02:32:41.715
[SPEAKER_22]: No, you're not getting the microphone back.

02:32:41.735 --> 02:32:42.596
[SPEAKER_06]: Do they have a flag?

02:32:46.614 --> 02:32:48.876
[SPEAKER_06]: No flag, no country, you can't have one.

02:32:48.896 --> 02:32:51.799
[SPEAKER_22]: Jamie wants to hear it one more time, and then I swear to God we're dropping this subject forever.

02:32:53.300 --> 02:32:54.081
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright, let's see, here we go.

02:32:58.505 --> 02:32:58.805
[SPEAKER_06]: See?

02:33:00.646 --> 02:33:02.268
[SPEAKER_06]: If you listen to it with that in mind.

02:33:02.988 --> 02:33:04.790
[SPEAKER_22]: But then again, you also... Broke off.

02:33:05.190 --> 02:33:09.294
[SPEAKER_22]: Here's what we gotta say also, that's not gonna rip her voice exactly how it was.

02:33:09.814 --> 02:33:11.676
[SPEAKER_22]: It could've ripped off part of the voice.

02:33:11.696 --> 02:33:13.918
[SPEAKER_06]: It didn't rip her voice, it ripped everything else out.

02:33:14.315 --> 02:33:18.998
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, it might not have worked just perfectly, because I know when I try to take vocals out of stuff, sometimes you hear echoes in the background.

02:33:19.118 --> 02:33:19.558
[SPEAKER_22]: You know what?

02:33:19.578 --> 02:33:22.139
[SPEAKER_22]: We could actually run it through our computers and see what happens.

02:33:22.199 --> 02:33:23.220
[SPEAKER_22]: Let's try doing this.

02:33:23.320 --> 02:33:25.081
[SPEAKER_22]: Let me open up the file here.

02:33:26.862 --> 02:33:28.403
[SPEAKER_22]: And then I'm going to make some changes to it.

02:33:30.324 --> 02:33:32.185
[SPEAKER_22]: And just kind of, you know, do the cancellation thing.

02:33:33.565 --> 02:33:34.906
[SPEAKER_22]: And let's see what it sounds like this time.

02:33:34.946 --> 02:33:36.847
[SPEAKER_22]: Let's listen to our version of it.

02:33:38.308 --> 02:33:38.868
[SPEAKER_13]: Touch me.

02:33:44.485 --> 02:33:46.647
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, fuck me!

02:33:49.609 --> 02:33:50.110
[SPEAKER_22]: Amazing.

02:33:50.410 --> 02:33:50.870
[SPEAKER_22]: Amazing.

02:33:52.291 --> 02:33:52.712
[SPEAKER_22]: Amazing.

02:33:52.812 --> 02:33:53.052
[SPEAKER_22]: See?

02:33:53.432 --> 02:33:57.335
[SPEAKER_06]: The original was doctored.

02:33:58.216 --> 02:33:59.517
[SPEAKER_22]: The original was doctored.

02:34:05.441 --> 02:34:06.642
[SPEAKER_22]: I think we should go to a break now.

02:34:07.423 --> 02:34:08.564
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wait, not before we get...

02:34:09.673 --> 02:34:09.873
[SPEAKER_22]: What?

02:34:10.253 --> 02:34:11.134
[SPEAKER_04]: Bleached Katamari.

02:34:12.474 --> 02:34:13.614
[SPEAKER_04]: Bleached Katamari?

02:34:13.634 --> 02:34:16.936
[SPEAKER_22]: Have I been out of the room too long?

02:34:16.996 --> 02:34:18.376
[SPEAKER_22]: You have, you have.

02:34:18.496 --> 02:34:22.958
[SPEAKER_22]: But Extrofer, you're back just in time because I'll be damned if we miss this.

02:34:23.058 --> 02:34:24.459
[SPEAKER_04]: Please don't play the gay music.

02:34:24.899 --> 02:34:25.679
[SPEAKER_22]: You get the gay music.

02:34:25.799 --> 02:34:27.800
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want the gay music.

02:34:29.040 --> 02:34:30.721
[SPEAKER_22]: We need Extrofer's movie reveal.

02:34:32.068 --> 02:34:33.589
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to choose the music for that.

02:34:33.669 --> 02:34:33.830
[SPEAKER_22]: No.

02:34:34.330 --> 02:34:34.930
[SPEAKER_22]: Extover.

02:34:36.031 --> 02:34:36.932
[SPEAKER_04]: What did you see this week?

02:34:37.593 --> 02:34:41.556
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I saw In Her Shoes yesterday.

02:34:41.616 --> 02:34:42.497
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't that a chick flick?

02:34:43.317 --> 02:34:45.019
[SPEAKER_04]: It is not a chick flick.

02:34:45.259 --> 02:34:47.841
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, it's a chick flick for gay guys.

02:34:49.362 --> 02:34:50.243
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no.

02:34:50.263 --> 02:34:51.644
[SPEAKER_04]: Does that make it a dick flick?

02:34:52.325 --> 02:34:53.426
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes it a dick flick.

02:34:53.546 --> 02:34:54.547
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes it a cock flick.

02:34:55.455 --> 02:34:56.475
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like Sex and the City.

02:34:57.195 --> 02:34:57.656
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no.

02:34:58.096 --> 02:35:07.718
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually a movie about two sisters who go through some life-altering changes and how they kind of come together.

02:35:08.019 --> 02:35:18.422
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's a good movie if you're ever in the process of... Unfortunately, sometimes in your life you may lose friends or you may be in the process of losing friends.

02:35:18.922 --> 02:35:23.143
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a good movie to see when you're in that process.

02:35:23.840 --> 02:35:27.501
[SPEAKER_04]: But otherwise, I mean, it's a total conflict.

02:35:31.883 --> 02:35:34.824
[SPEAKER_04]: The female listeners of our show, thank you for that analogy.

02:35:35.624 --> 02:35:36.224
[SPEAKER_04]: No problem.

02:35:36.404 --> 02:35:36.845
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

02:35:38.985 --> 02:35:39.946
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw Serenity again.

02:35:40.426 --> 02:35:40.946
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay!

02:35:41.206 --> 02:35:41.946
[SPEAKER_04]: Talk about that.

02:35:42.066 --> 02:35:43.447
[SPEAKER_06]: We have to go see Serenity next week.

02:35:43.727 --> 02:35:45.087
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go see Serenity next week.

02:35:45.107 --> 02:35:45.527
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do it.

02:35:45.768 --> 02:35:46.568
[SPEAKER_04]: After Firefly.

02:35:46.628 --> 02:35:48.028
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody needs to go see Serenity.

02:35:48.048 --> 02:35:49.589
[SPEAKER_06]: Next Friday, we're going to see Serenity again.

02:35:49.609 --> 02:35:50.269
[SPEAKER_04]: I got nine points.

02:35:50.289 --> 02:35:50.709
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, never mind.

02:35:53.779 --> 02:35:55.020
[SPEAKER_06]: We kind of spoiled it for Dan.

02:35:56.421 --> 02:35:59.624
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we spoiled it for Jamie's husband.

02:35:59.724 --> 02:36:01.205
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, don't spoil it for the listeners, please.

02:36:01.565 --> 02:36:03.727
[SPEAKER_22]: But how did you spoil it without spoiling it for the listeners?

02:36:03.827 --> 02:36:06.148
[SPEAKER_04]: We just mentioned, oh, that's so sad.

02:36:06.369 --> 02:36:08.250
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and oh, that's so funny.

02:36:08.670 --> 02:36:10.792
[SPEAKER_04]: And oh, that's so sad how that was so funny.

02:36:11.452 --> 02:36:16.156
[SPEAKER_06]: And oh, that's so... And the people who have seen it will know what I'm talking about.

02:36:16.196 --> 02:36:21.740
[SPEAKER_06]: You have this utter scene of, oh, and even a little bit of laughter, and all of a sudden, bam, dead silence.

02:36:22.259 --> 02:36:42.512
[SPEAKER_22]: I know, it was a crazy time Without being a spoiler I'm being corrected by one of our chatters I'm going through trying to tally the cage match votes The Smile DK song is Ding Ding Dong Not Ding Dang Dong Okay people, do you see how I got confused?

02:36:42.692 --> 02:36:51.157
[SPEAKER_06]: Come on, it was one vowel Here's your Serenity spoiler, by the way Thank you, Goggle, by the way The Reavers all put on tutus and do the hokey pokey in roller skates

02:36:52.745 --> 02:36:53.865
[SPEAKER_04]: and NYP and Bowls.

02:36:55.246 --> 02:36:56.046
[SPEAKER_22]: You guys are weird.

02:36:56.166 --> 02:36:57.626
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you still have your icons on your computer?

02:36:58.807 --> 02:37:04.848
[SPEAKER_22]: No, I deleted all those folders that you placed on my computer last week with the... Which makes me want to put some more on there.

02:37:05.028 --> 02:37:05.628
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think so.

02:37:05.648 --> 02:37:08.929
[SPEAKER_04]: So what are we going to say about Serenity being in 9th place, huh?

02:37:09.549 --> 02:37:10.990
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Serenity was in 9th place.

02:37:11.050 --> 02:37:12.170
[SPEAKER_06]: How much money has it made so far?

02:37:12.630 --> 02:37:14.870
[SPEAKER_04]: About 17 point something million dollars.

02:37:14.910 --> 02:37:16.611
[SPEAKER_06]: Serenity needs to make $80,000 so we get a sequel.

02:37:16.651 --> 02:37:16.611
$80,000? $80,000.

02:37:21.974 --> 02:37:24.376
[SPEAKER_22]: Everyone needs to see Serenity a bajillion times.

02:37:24.416 --> 02:37:27.218
[SPEAKER_22]: So declares me.

02:37:43.220 --> 02:37:49.464
[SPEAKER_04]: To imagine how many times a bajillion is, imagine one time a bajillion times.

02:37:51.205 --> 02:37:52.065
[SPEAKER_04]: That was really poor.

02:38:03.996 --> 02:38:05.798
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright, you guys ready to find out who won tonight's cage match?

02:38:05.818 --> 02:38:07.960
[SPEAKER_22]: Have you ever thought about password protecting your computer?

02:38:08.160 --> 02:38:09.261
[SPEAKER_06]: Girls, that's one!

02:38:09.301 --> 02:38:09.881
[SPEAKER_22]: Why, what?

02:38:10.562 --> 02:38:14.205
[SPEAKER_22]: So... Aw, Jesus, did you just go in and make folders on my desktop?

02:38:14.465 --> 02:38:16.587
[SPEAKER_22]: No, I could, should... No?

02:38:16.847 --> 02:38:19.550
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, even I voted in the cage match today, didn't I, Rob?

02:38:19.590 --> 02:38:19.890
[SPEAKER_22]: Stop it.

02:38:20.050 --> 02:38:20.270
[SPEAKER_22]: What?

02:38:20.611 --> 02:38:21.852
[SPEAKER_06]: Even I voted in the cage match today.

02:38:21.872 --> 02:38:22.532
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, but it didn't count.

02:38:23.033 --> 02:38:25.495
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I voted for Skye as the voice of the game for matching service.

02:38:25.515 --> 02:38:26.236
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright.

02:38:27.133 --> 02:38:29.194

[SPEAKER_22]: And no song, I mean, it was very close between all three songs tonight.

02:38:37.577 --> 02:38:38.778
[SPEAKER_22]: So the chat room just loved them all.

02:38:39.358 --> 02:38:40.558
[SPEAKER_22]: But only one could win.

02:38:41.679 --> 02:38:49.022

[SPEAKER_22]: And actually, Miklatov won it, and I didn't even win it, so... Fuck you, Miklatov, for showing me up.

02:39:04.031 --> 02:39:05.312
[SPEAKER_06]: More proof, what have I been telling you?

02:39:05.352 --> 02:39:07.532
[SPEAKER_06]: Pick stuff other than generic trance, and you'll have a winner.

02:39:07.552 --> 02:39:09.393
[SPEAKER_22]: I have been picking stuff other than generic trance.

02:39:10.433 --> 02:39:12.033
[SPEAKER_22]: Pick Britney Spears' Toxic.

02:39:12.154 --> 02:39:12.914
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, God, no.

02:39:13.314 --> 02:39:14.534
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just kidding.

02:39:14.554 --> 02:39:17.495
[SPEAKER_22]: Actually, it's funny, I actually did have a generic trance song, but it was really good.

02:39:18.223 --> 02:39:20.064
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that means that next week I have to play ABBA.

02:39:20.805 --> 02:39:23.866
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, I was actually disappointed that you did not choose ABBA tonight.

02:39:24.707 --> 02:39:29.009
[SPEAKER_06]: I was trying to actually be serious, but I almost put it in a Danger Doom track.

02:39:30.270 --> 02:39:34.333
[SPEAKER_22]: Did you know that the new Madonna song actually samples ABBA?

02:39:35.013 --> 02:39:35.273
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

02:39:35.533 --> 02:39:41.677
[SPEAKER_22]: And I honestly thought I had never heard the gayest song ever made, but I think this could possibly be it.

02:39:41.917 --> 02:39:46.360
[SPEAKER_22]: Fusing Madonna and ABBA together could quite possibly be anal sex in song form.

02:39:46.680 --> 02:39:46.780
[SPEAKER_22]: Hmm.

02:39:48.348 --> 02:39:50.529
[SPEAKER_06]: I've already heard foreplay in song form.

02:39:50.869 --> 02:39:53.911
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyone who's ever seen Phantom of the Opera has.

02:39:54.291 --> 02:39:56.993
[SPEAKER_04]: There should be an ab workout machine called Abba.

02:39:57.273 --> 02:39:57.813
[SPEAKER_04]: The Abba.

02:39:58.834 --> 02:40:02.696
[SPEAKER_04]: Whenever you crunch it, it gives you like... Mama Mia.

02:40:03.076 --> 02:40:05.638
[SPEAKER_22]: Thanks for stopping, stupid.

02:40:06.158 --> 02:40:06.438
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright.

02:40:09.620 --> 02:40:09.960
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright.

02:40:10.801 --> 02:40:11.541
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh my god, it's Rob.

02:40:11.822 --> 02:40:20.367
[SPEAKER_22]: I've heard music in foreplay form before too and it's going to start off this next break and we'll be back with more Orange Lounge Radio and the FUs of the week.

02:40:20.387 --> 02:40:20.988
[SPEAKER_22]: We've got to get to those.

02:40:21.028 --> 02:40:21.748
[SPEAKER_22]: We're running out of time.

02:40:22.068 --> 02:40:24.450
[SPEAKER_22]: So we'll be right back after this break with more Orange Lounge Radio.

02:41:12.661 --> 02:41:13.622
Thanks for watching!

02:41:41.586 --> 02:41:42.447
Thank you for watching!

02:45:07.455 --> 02:45:23.943
Came in from the rainy Thursday on the Avenue Thought I heard you talking so fast I turned on the lights, the TV, and the radio Still I can't escape the ghost of you What is happening?

02:46:24.358 --> 02:46:29.122
[SPEAKER_13]: From Step Squad to Orange Lounge, this PDR sucks!

02:46:33.706 --> 02:46:36.128
[SPEAKER_13]: Holla!

02:46:38.711 --> 02:46:40.132
[SPEAKER_22]: We're back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:46:40.372 --> 02:46:42.794
[SPEAKER_22]: We need more celebrity promos like that, actually.

02:46:42.954 --> 02:46:44.516
[SPEAKER_22]: We need more promos in general.

02:46:44.596 --> 02:46:47.158
[SPEAKER_22]: We just need to go out with a tape recorder and get more promos.

02:46:47.338 --> 02:46:48.199
[SPEAKER_22]: I'll do a promo.

02:46:48.639 --> 02:46:49.200
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, God.

02:46:50.410 --> 02:46:54.917
[SPEAKER_22]: Remember, the promos run all day long, though, on the station, so you have to keep it G-rated, because people do listen to us at work.

02:46:56.148 --> 02:47:00.312
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

02:47:20.228 --> 02:47:28.655
[SPEAKER_22]: Hoppin' Choppin' from DDR Mario, of course, they're kind of interworking in that song from, what the hell was it, Mario Brothers 2?

02:47:29.596 --> 02:47:32.598
[SPEAKER_22]: God's like, one of my favorite video games of all time, I can't remember the damn name of it.

02:47:33.059 --> 02:47:37.562
[SPEAKER_22]: And then, Aurora, featuring Amy Coleman, Ordinary World, of course.

02:47:37.662 --> 02:47:41.866
[SPEAKER_22]: Another trance remix of an old song, another thing you love, DarkSakura, yes?

02:47:42.666 --> 02:47:46.409
[SPEAKER_22]: When people take 70s and 80s songs, and I particularly hate that version.

02:47:47.190 --> 02:47:48.191
[SPEAKER_22]: I have a version of that by Utada Hikaru.

02:48:09.810 --> 02:48:16.331
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, I'm sure that's fine, but close to you has been done like a million times, and this one was especially offensive.

02:48:18.052 --> 02:48:18.572
[SPEAKER_22]: All right, anyway.

02:48:19.992 --> 02:48:22.773
[SPEAKER_22]: We need to get to the FUs of the week, because I'll be damned if we're not running out of show time.

02:48:22.813 --> 02:48:28.054
[SPEAKER_22]: So chat room, when you guys send in your FUs tonight, you need to keep it short, because if you don't keep it short, you're getting cut off.

02:48:29.254 --> 02:48:30.234
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm cutting you off tonight.

02:48:31.694 --> 02:48:33.415
[SPEAKER_22]: So we're going to get into the FUs.

02:48:33.455 --> 02:48:35.455
[SPEAKER_04]: So just say fuck you to Rob, and that's it.

02:48:37.336 --> 02:48:39.196
[SPEAKER_22]: Extifer, I will take that microphone away from you.

02:48:41.567 --> 02:48:43.788
[SPEAKER_22]: Bugged, will you please babysit Extifer?

02:48:44.048 --> 02:48:46.170
[SPEAKER_22]: That's going to be your new official show title, Bugged.

02:48:46.190 --> 02:48:47.951
[SPEAKER_22]: You're Extifer's babysitter.

02:48:48.091 --> 02:48:49.151
Get it out of your ass!

02:48:53.594 --> 02:48:54.114
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, lordy.

02:48:54.234 --> 02:48:54.534
[SPEAKER_22]: All right.

02:48:56.035 --> 02:48:59.857
[SPEAKER_22]: In order for us to have the FUs of the week, I better get DarkSakura's song ready.

02:48:59.937 --> 02:49:02.699
[SPEAKER_22]: All right, DarkSakura, why is it that we do the FUs of the week every single week?

02:49:03.319 --> 02:49:04.340
[SPEAKER_06]: Grr, argh.

02:49:07.093 --> 02:49:24.967
[SPEAKER_06]: FU goes toward all of the traffic on my way up here FU goes toward internet stalkers FU goes toward my rash and amoxicillin and the fact that my ass itches

02:49:27.379 --> 02:49:35.545
[SPEAKER_06]: And F you to Blackboard for being down all day because ARC's website was down and I couldn't do my homework.

02:49:35.685 --> 02:49:36.985
[SPEAKER_06]: So fuck all that, I'm done.

02:49:39.027 --> 02:49:39.947
[SPEAKER_22]: Moving on to Loki!

02:49:42.809 --> 02:49:45.191
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, well anyways, what?

02:49:46.412 --> 02:49:47.713
[SPEAKER_03]: What the hell is your problem?

02:49:50.514 --> 02:49:50.895
[SPEAKER_22]: What?

02:49:51.315 --> 02:49:51.995
[SPEAKER_22]: It's my song.

02:49:52.236 --> 02:49:55.938
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyways, um, fuck you McDonald's for making subpar food.

02:49:56.534 --> 02:50:00.836
[SPEAKER_22]: and until they recently fixed their cups for making cups that explode in my cup holders.

02:50:01.577 --> 02:50:02.597
[SPEAKER_22]: Because that fucking sucks.

02:50:02.837 --> 02:50:06.720
[SPEAKER_22]: And also fuck you to my neighbors who keep throwing their couches in the goddamn dumpster.

02:50:07.380 --> 02:50:10.642
[SPEAKER_22]: That is not what the dumpster is for, it's for trash, not your fucking furniture.

02:50:11.202 --> 02:50:14.163
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, pay for it to be hauled away like everyone else.

02:50:15.324 --> 02:50:22.508
[SPEAKER_22]: And also, um, fuck you to winning this stupid free online, um, film, uh,

02:50:24.147 --> 02:50:24.547
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, whatever.

02:50:24.848 --> 02:50:26.409
[SPEAKER_22]: I hate that fucking Monopoly game.

02:50:26.669 --> 02:50:30.352
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm done.

02:50:39.659 --> 02:50:52.850
[SPEAKER_22]: I'd like to give an F you this week to Paranoia Survivor Max for showing up way more than it's welcome on the totally random DDR stream matchup, but it's a good thing my life doesn't revolve around DDR, or I might be upset about that, huh?

02:50:54.246 --> 02:51:04.055
[SPEAKER_22]: I'd also like to give an F you to the fact that I feel really, really unprepared for something that's about to take place a week from tomorrow and I'm not excited about it, but that's alright, life sucks sometimes.

02:51:04.095 --> 02:51:04.495
[SPEAKER_22]: Is it my birthday?

02:51:05.076 --> 02:51:05.937
[SPEAKER_22]: No, it's not your birthday.

02:51:06.217 --> 02:51:06.637
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes it is.

02:51:06.898 --> 02:51:09.440
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, I mean, yes it is your birthday, but that's not why I'm mad.

02:51:09.940 --> 02:51:10.321
[SPEAKER_22]: Shut up!

02:51:10.681 --> 02:51:12.423
[SPEAKER_22]: This is my segment.

02:51:13.183 --> 02:51:17.968
[SPEAKER_22]: And then an F you to rainbows, like the one on next to her shirt.

02:51:19.326 --> 02:51:28.931
[SPEAKER_22]: FU to fuel prices, of course 325 for the low end on diesel, which is kind of crappy The anti-FU to that is, I'm still getting 45 miles a gallon And another FU is to extra fur as well Tyco drums Do they have to be so fucking loud?

02:51:28.971 --> 02:51:29.291
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's all

02:51:49.733 --> 02:51:50.153
[SPEAKER_16]: Extoverb.

02:51:51.734 --> 02:51:52.935
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, fuck you, bugs.

02:51:54.336 --> 02:51:55.016
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, no, no, no, no.

02:51:55.316 --> 02:52:04.301
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have really any FUs other than, uh, let's see, FU to things that suck.

02:52:05.882 --> 02:52:06.583
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I don't know.

02:52:06.663 --> 02:52:10.605
[SPEAKER_04]: No, not FU to things that suck, because things that suck are sometimes really good.

02:52:16.684 --> 02:52:18.445
[SPEAKER_04]: That's looking at me like, hurry up and finish!

02:52:19.125 --> 02:52:19.746
[SPEAKER_04]: That's done!

02:52:19.766 --> 02:52:20.346
[SPEAKER_04]: It's done!

02:52:20.386 --> 02:52:22.187
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay, you need to say something.

02:52:22.247 --> 02:52:23.427
[SPEAKER_04]: I climaxed.

02:52:23.487 --> 02:52:24.908
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm done, I'm done, okay.

02:52:25.288 --> 02:52:26.089
[SPEAKER_04]: Sexual reference.

02:52:26.889 --> 02:52:27.029
[SPEAKER_22]: End.

02:52:29.651 --> 02:52:30.151
[SPEAKER_22]: Chat room time.

[SPEAKER_22]: Happy birthday, fuck you.

[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, that's it.

02:53:22.365 --> 02:53:22.806
[SPEAKER_22]: Just kidding.

02:53:28.788 --> 02:53:32.189

02:54:00.922 --> 02:54:02.343
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh my god, this is classic.

02:54:02.403 --> 02:54:11.847
[SPEAKER_22]: Side note, you guys, on the DDR Freak forums, you know how there's this big stink that in DDR Extreme, Memories is like a hidden song that's actually on the disc, but nobody knows how to unlock the song in the game?

02:54:12.187 --> 02:54:17.549
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, some guy comes on there and says, My Memories has been in DDR Extreme the whole time, I don't know what you guys are freaking out about.

02:54:19.350 --> 02:54:20.651
[SPEAKER_22]: And they're like, Oh yeah?

02:54:20.911 --> 02:54:22.011
[SPEAKER_22]: Send us a screenshot!

02:54:22.371 --> 02:54:25.093
[SPEAKER_22]: And he sends a screenshot, and it's the Japanese version of Extreme.

02:54:28.214 --> 02:54:29.615
[SPEAKER_22]: And he took six points of damage!

02:54:32.627 --> 02:54:39.391
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, and FU to the live 365 keeps kicking me off stream and skipping so I miss most of the show.

02:56:01.208 --> 02:56:04.630
[SPEAKER_22]: F you to the LA Angels for nearly eliminating the Yankees in the playoffs.

02:56:06.871 --> 02:56:09.933
[SPEAKER_22]: And Floatwalk says, from Melody, F you to Poland.

02:56:12.195 --> 02:56:13.555
[SPEAKER_22]: Just the whole country, fuck them all.

02:56:13.635 --> 02:56:14.216
[SPEAKER_22]: Egypt's better.

02:56:15.116 --> 02:56:15.617
[SPEAKER_22]: Fuck them all.

02:56:16.537 --> 02:56:18.338
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright, just kidding if you're Polish, just kidding.

02:56:18.358 --> 02:56:20.780
[SPEAKER_22]: There's obviously an inside joke there that you don't know about if you got offended.

02:56:20.800 --> 02:56:22.261
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm of Polish descent.

02:56:22.321 --> 02:56:24.322
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, obviously, there's an inside joke, so don't take it seriously.

02:56:24.824 --> 02:56:25.805
[SPEAKER_06]: So fuck me.

02:56:27.907 --> 02:56:28.668
[SPEAKER_22]: No thank you, I'll leave it.

02:56:28.688 --> 02:56:30.730
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, Will Smith doesn't have to cuss to sell records.

02:56:31.630 --> 02:56:32.211
[SPEAKER_06]: But I do.

02:56:32.671 --> 02:56:34.313
[SPEAKER_06]: So fuck him, and fuck you too.

02:56:34.333 --> 02:56:36.455
[SPEAKER_22]: Isn't that a lyric?

02:56:36.735 --> 02:56:38.377
[SPEAKER_22]: Isn't that a lyric in a song somewhere?

02:56:38.577 --> 02:56:40.479
[SPEAKER_06]: It's from an Eminem song.

02:56:40.539 --> 02:56:42.461
[SPEAKER_22]: I cuss when I've heard that lyric somewhere before.

02:56:42.841 --> 02:56:44.262
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, Will Smith really prides himself on it.

02:56:44.302 --> 02:56:45.363
[SPEAKER_22]: He doesn't curse in his music.

02:56:45.384 --> 02:56:48.807
[SPEAKER_22]: But he samples everybody.

02:56:49.628 --> 02:56:50.028
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, he does.

02:56:52.861 --> 02:56:54.042
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, we had one late FU.

02:56:54.682 --> 02:56:57.383
[SPEAKER_22]: Morty says, Froke, Frigid Roommates.

02:56:59.124 --> 02:56:59.624
[SPEAKER_22]: Frigid Roommates.

02:56:59.644 --> 02:57:00.124
[SPEAKER_22]: I agree.

02:57:01.144 --> 02:57:02.225
[SPEAKER_22]: Shut up, asshole.

02:57:03.205 --> 02:57:04.126
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm not frigid.

02:57:05.586 --> 02:57:07.207
[SPEAKER_22]: I'll have you know, I was quite warm.

02:57:07.327 --> 02:57:07.627
[SPEAKER_22]: Never mind.

02:57:07.647 --> 02:57:09.588
[SPEAKER_22]: She's kidding.

02:57:09.628 --> 02:57:09.928
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm kidding.

02:57:09.968 --> 02:57:10.248
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm kidding.

02:57:10.929 --> 02:57:11.269
[SPEAKER_22]: All right.

02:57:12.964 --> 02:57:14.324
[SPEAKER_22]: God, we're running out of time on the show.

02:57:14.344 --> 02:57:15.545
[SPEAKER_22]: They want to do Ask Orange Lounge.

02:57:15.585 --> 02:57:18.005
[SPEAKER_22]: We don't really have the time, so I think we're going to have to... That's it.

02:57:18.025 --> 02:57:18.785
[SPEAKER_22]: You want to do it real quick?

02:57:18.825 --> 02:57:19.465
[SPEAKER_22]: Just do it.

02:57:19.726 --> 02:57:20.266
[SPEAKER_22]: All right.

02:57:20.346 --> 02:57:22.706
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, because we still got the podcast to do, and you want to go out.

02:57:23.586 --> 02:57:23.906
[SPEAKER_22]: I know.

02:57:24.267 --> 02:57:24.547
[SPEAKER_22]: All right.

02:57:25.247 --> 02:57:28.348
[SPEAKER_06]: But where would we be without our fans?

02:57:28.528 --> 02:57:29.308
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably in bed.

02:57:29.408 --> 02:57:29.768
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

02:57:31.248 --> 02:57:32.088
[SPEAKER_04]: Doing what in bed?

02:57:32.288 --> 02:57:32.688
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

02:57:33.649 --> 02:57:34.309
[SPEAKER_06]: Summer party!

02:57:37.386 --> 02:57:39.407
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright guys, fine, we'll do really quick.

02:57:39.427 --> 02:57:47.729
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember going to slumber parties with a bunch of people and the first girl who fell asleep, we would take her bra and stuff, like dip it in orange juice and put it in the freezer.

02:57:48.229 --> 02:57:51.110
[SPEAKER_04]: My sister and her friend did that to one of their friends one time.

02:57:51.610 --> 02:57:52.430
[SPEAKER_04]: It was really funny.

02:57:52.570 --> 02:58:00.792
[SPEAKER_06]: And then when the last person to stay awake would go and put toothpaste on the toilet seat so that the first person who woke up in half-asleep mode to go use the bathroom would stick to the toilet.

02:58:06.014 --> 02:58:06.254
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow.

02:58:13.044 --> 02:58:15.986
[SPEAKER_22]: Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.

02:58:16.486 --> 02:58:19.688
[SPEAKER_22]: What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?

02:58:20.209 --> 02:58:21.770
[SPEAKER_22]: I think it's very interesting.

02:58:22.070 --> 02:58:27.173
[SPEAKER_22]: We didn't even need a question to find out that Jamie played with other girls' bras.

02:58:34.192 --> 02:58:36.993
[SPEAKER_22]: Fireboma said, where do babies come from?

02:58:37.213 --> 02:58:38.833
[SPEAKER_22]: No, seriously, I don't know.

02:58:39.253 --> 02:58:42.534
[SPEAKER_22]: I will let Extifer answer this question on behalf of Orange Lounge Radio.

02:58:42.634 --> 02:58:44.655
[SPEAKER_22]: Extifer, where do babies come from?

02:58:45.035 --> 02:58:47.195
[SPEAKER_04]: Babies come from a female's coo.

02:58:51.136 --> 02:58:55.077
[SPEAKER_22]: Legend of Zaku said, you guys seriously need a Wikipedia entry.

02:58:55.737 --> 02:58:56.117
[SPEAKER_22]: We do.

02:58:56.157 --> 02:58:56.837
[SPEAKER_22]: How do we do that?

02:58:57.578 --> 02:58:58.878
[SPEAKER_22]: Someone has to make us one.

02:58:59.804 --> 02:59:00.705
[SPEAKER_22]: Somebody make us one.

02:59:00.985 --> 02:59:01.807
[SPEAKER_22]: Is Bug gonna do it?

02:59:02.387 --> 02:59:03.429
[SPEAKER_22]: Bug's working on it right now.

02:59:03.489 --> 02:59:05.771
[SPEAKER_22]: Do people have to vote on it to make it stick?

02:59:06.232 --> 02:59:06.552
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, good.

02:59:06.933 --> 02:59:08.195
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, Bug's gonna write that right now.

02:59:08.555 --> 02:59:09.156
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Zaku.

02:59:09.176 --> 02:59:10.337
[SPEAKER_22]: The ferret needs an entry, too.

02:59:10.417 --> 02:59:11.098
[SPEAKER_22]: We'll post that, though.

02:59:11.479 --> 02:59:14.142
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, other things I want to point out...

02:59:15.612 --> 02:59:20.554
[SPEAKER_22]: Vote us a 5 on your player window in Line365, speaking of voting stuff.

02:59:20.854 --> 02:59:24.975
[SPEAKER_22]: And for the love of God, vote for us on Podcast Alley, because we're really falling behind over there.

02:59:25.275 --> 02:59:29.517
[SPEAKER_22]: So for your convenience, I'm going to post a link to where you can vote for our show.

02:59:29.557 --> 02:59:34.839
[SPEAKER_22]: And you should do that right now, because that's a really good way for our podcast to get exposure.

02:59:39.770 --> 02:59:41.091
[SPEAKER_22]: I hate that podcast.

02:59:41.991 --> 02:59:42.612
[SPEAKER_22]: It's a gas.

02:59:44.113 --> 02:59:44.393
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright.

02:59:45.974 --> 02:59:46.994
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, did somebody already do it?

02:59:49.756 --> 02:59:51.297
[SPEAKER_22]: Somebody posted a Wikipedia link.

02:59:51.417 --> 02:59:52.177
[SPEAKER_22]: Did somebody already do it?

02:59:53.818 --> 02:59:55.739
[SPEAKER_22]: Somebody probably just made an entry that says, it sucks.

02:59:56.720 --> 02:59:57.440
[SPEAKER_22]: It stinks!

02:59:59.601 --> 03:00:00.282
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, no, it's not there.

03:00:00.302 --> 03:00:00.562
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

03:00:01.002 --> 03:00:01.663
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, you need to start.

03:00:01.703 --> 03:00:02.843
[SPEAKER_22]: Somebody needs to hurry up and write it.

03:00:03.664 --> 03:00:03.924
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright.

03:00:05.814 --> 03:00:11.476
[SPEAKER_22]: Sakurina says, why is American Thanksgiving later than Canadian Thanksgiving, which is now?

03:00:12.137 --> 03:00:13.037
Wait a second!

03:00:13.297 --> 03:00:14.037
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh yes, Loki.

03:00:14.538 --> 03:00:17.039
[SPEAKER_22]: Why do the Canadians get Thanksgiving anyways?

03:00:17.059 --> 03:00:18.579
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, how many Indians did they kill?

03:00:18.699 --> 03:00:19.039
[SPEAKER_22]: Come on.

03:00:19.520 --> 03:00:20.280
[SPEAKER_22]: Exactly.

03:00:20.820 --> 03:00:22.261
[SPEAKER_22]: They didn't rape the land of Indians.

03:00:24.835 --> 03:00:26.135
[SPEAKER_22]: No, just kidding.

03:00:27.436 --> 03:00:29.216
[SPEAKER_22]: God, we're horribly offensive sometimes.

03:00:29.276 --> 03:00:30.776
[SPEAKER_22]: I really hope we didn't offend anybody with that comment.

03:00:31.116 --> 03:00:35.598
[SPEAKER_22]: But if anything, they should be giving thanks for maple syrup because that's what they're known for.

03:00:36.058 --> 03:00:36.978
[SPEAKER_22]: That and Bryan Adams.

03:00:37.478 --> 03:00:39.618
[SPEAKER_22]: I really don't know why Thanksgiving is later.

03:00:42.059 --> 03:00:45.120
[SPEAKER_22]: It's all timed for the shopping industry.

03:00:45.140 --> 03:00:47.200
[SPEAKER_06]: They gave us Atlantis, Rob.

03:00:47.840 --> 03:00:48.481
[SPEAKER_22]: I know, I know.

03:00:48.721 --> 03:00:49.861
[SPEAKER_16]: And Bryan Adams.

03:00:51.841 --> 03:00:52.822
[SPEAKER_16]: And William Shatner.

03:00:53.622 --> 03:00:54.402
[SPEAKER_16]: Where would we be

03:00:56.812 --> 03:00:58.913
[SPEAKER_04]: Wasn't Michael J. Fox from Canada?

03:00:59.954 --> 03:01:01.335
[SPEAKER_04]: What about David Duchovny?

03:01:02.055 --> 03:01:06.578
[SPEAKER_06]: You remember that song, David Duchovny, Why Won't You Love Me?

03:01:07.378 --> 03:01:07.659
[SPEAKER_22]: No.

03:01:08.299 --> 03:01:09.500
[SPEAKER_06]: Someone wrote a song about him.

03:01:09.800 --> 03:01:14.663
[SPEAKER_22]: If somebody in the chatroom is saying that DDR Freak is not allowed to have a Wikipedia entry, so why should we?

03:01:15.111 --> 03:01:16.832
[SPEAKER_22]: Who said DDR Free is not allowed to have a Wikipedia entry?

03:01:16.852 --> 03:01:17.393
[SPEAKER_22]: That's not cool!

03:01:17.433 --> 03:01:19.435
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, make them one!

03:01:20.696 --> 03:01:22.777
[SPEAKER_22]: I think they had one and it got removed or something.

03:01:23.118 --> 03:01:24.299
[SPEAKER_22]: Somebody probably complained about it.

03:01:25.159 --> 03:01:30.844
[SPEAKER_22]: Dude, if we get a Wikipedia entry posted, just fucking don't complain about it and we'll be fine.

03:01:30.924 --> 03:01:32.065
[SPEAKER_22]: So don't tattle.

03:01:32.385 --> 03:01:35.988
[SPEAKER_22]: If you tattle, I will come find you and beat you up and it will not be a good thing.

03:01:36.609 --> 03:01:38.971
[SPEAKER_22]: Because you'll probably end up beating Rafa.

03:01:41.837 --> 03:01:52.304
[SPEAKER_22]: Jaded2005 says, why is it cheaper to rent movies and expensive to rent video games?

03:01:54.226 --> 03:01:55.747
[SPEAKER_22]: Because video games are more expensive than movies.

03:01:55.787 --> 03:01:57.168
[SPEAKER_22]: Video games set you back like 50 bucks.

03:01:57.308 --> 03:01:59.469
[SPEAKER_22]: Movies now only set you back like 25.

03:01:59.629 --> 03:02:03.352
[SPEAKER_22]: Exactly, and they have to rent more times in order to make their money back.

03:02:05.794 --> 03:02:07.675
[SPEAKER_22]: And stop stealing games, people!

03:02:08.319 --> 03:02:10.040
[SPEAKER_22]: Stop stealing them from the rental stores.

03:02:10.060 --> 03:02:11.081
[SPEAKER_22]: That's what the internet's for.

03:02:12.582 --> 03:02:14.404
[SPEAKER_22]: If I mispronounce this, I'm really sorry.

03:02:14.524 --> 03:02:20.168
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know if it's just E or just with like the silent E. I'm not sure if the E is silent or not.

03:02:20.328 --> 03:02:21.149
[SPEAKER_22]: I think just.

03:02:21.509 --> 03:02:22.330
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm going to go with just.

03:02:23.951 --> 03:02:24.772
[SPEAKER_22]: It could be just day.

03:02:24.972 --> 03:02:28.855
[SPEAKER_22]: It could be like just day, like Jack A. This person is going to kick my ass.

03:02:29.075 --> 03:02:29.855
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm going to go with just.

03:02:29.935 --> 03:02:30.196
[SPEAKER_22]: All right.

03:02:30.716 --> 03:02:33.778
[SPEAKER_22]: Why did you decide to start making an online radio show?

03:02:33.798 --> 03:02:34.199
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

03:02:35.390 --> 03:02:42.299
[SPEAKER_22]: Meep, personally, I've been doing online radio personally since I was in college, which was a long time ago.

03:02:43.200 --> 03:02:51.370
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm actually not that old, but I was doing a college radio show and then I got invited to be on another internet radio program called Under Sedation Live.

03:02:51.730 --> 03:02:58.634
[SPEAKER_22]: That was years ago, and that just kind of turned into this, where it was like, you know what, we have fun doing Understation Live, let's do a show about video games.

03:02:58.914 --> 03:03:00.074
[SPEAKER_22]: And sure enough, here we are.

03:03:00.375 --> 03:03:02.256
[SPEAKER_22]: DarkSakura was a frequent guest on that show.

03:03:02.636 --> 03:03:05.858
[SPEAKER_22]: Loki just kind of showed up, but it worked out, so Loki's still here.

03:03:09.700 --> 03:03:10.420
[SPEAKER_22]: Juice Day.

03:03:10.540 --> 03:03:11.401
[SPEAKER_22]: It is Juice Day.

03:03:13.101 --> 03:03:14.782
[SPEAKER_22]: Not Just Day, but Juice Day.

03:03:15.743 --> 03:03:16.443
[SPEAKER_22]: Just for the record.

03:03:17.604 --> 03:03:17.864
[SPEAKER_22]: All right.

03:03:20.479 --> 03:03:37.746
[SPEAKER_22]: SSJ100 Matt wants to know, I may be the only person on Earth to break an afterburner pad.

03:03:38.146 --> 03:03:39.527
[SPEAKER_22]: Am I the only one to break one?

03:03:40.947 --> 03:03:40.987
[SPEAKER_22]: No.

03:03:42.908 --> 03:03:43.148
[SPEAKER_22]: No.

03:03:43.488 --> 03:03:44.068
[SPEAKER_22]: Loki says no.

03:03:44.148 --> 03:03:45.349
[SPEAKER_22]: How do you know this for a fact, Loki?

03:03:46.843 --> 03:03:49.764
[SPEAKER_22]: That's ridiculous to say that you're the only person that's broken one.

03:03:49.924 --> 03:03:51.044
[SPEAKER_22]: They're not indestructible.

03:03:51.724 --> 03:03:57.305
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm sure at some point, like, somebody who weighed like 700 pounds tried to play on one and probably broke it.

03:03:57.546 --> 03:03:59.566
[SPEAKER_22]: So, I think that's safe to say, wouldn't you?

03:04:00.646 --> 03:04:00.846
[SPEAKER_22]: Sure.

03:04:00.866 --> 03:04:04.047
[SPEAKER_22]: You're probably not the first, but you might be one of a very select few.

03:04:04.887 --> 03:04:06.048
[SPEAKER_22]: And that's something to be proud about.

03:04:07.448 --> 03:04:07.828
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, no.

03:04:09.268 --> 03:04:10.669
[SPEAKER_22]: Lastly, last question here.

03:04:10.689 --> 03:04:11.549
[SPEAKER_22]: I hope this is a good one.

03:04:11.969 --> 03:04:12.089
[SPEAKER_22]: Um...

03:04:13.624 --> 03:04:18.973
[SPEAKER_22]: Nintendomaniac64 Why did Midway delay the GameCube version of Midway Arcade Treasures 3?

03:04:20.635 --> 03:04:23.520
[SPEAKER_22]: And why did my laptop just lag for like 12 minutes straight?

03:04:23.988 --> 03:04:27.549
[SPEAKER_22]: GameCube games seem to be getting finished last.

03:04:27.849 --> 03:04:31.249
[SPEAKER_22]: Like, for example, Rainbow Six Lockdown didn't come out until two weeks later.

03:04:31.889 --> 03:04:35.270
[SPEAKER_22]: Same with Midway Arcade Treasures doesn't come out until two weeks later.

03:04:35.290 --> 03:04:38.150
[SPEAKER_22]: One of the Mortal Kombat games came out way later for GameCube 2, right?

03:04:38.190 --> 03:04:39.511
[SPEAKER_22]: The Deception.

03:04:39.751 --> 03:04:47.332
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, it's just, I don't know, either they have to go through some process of, you know, Nintendo has to review it or something, or I don't know.

03:04:47.812 --> 03:04:49.092
[SPEAKER_22]: For whatever reason, it gets delayed.

03:04:51.313 --> 03:04:51.953
[SPEAKER_22]: Very interesting.

03:04:52.733 --> 03:04:52.993
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright.

03:04:54.090 --> 03:04:55.610
[SPEAKER_22]: We've got to call it a show, boys and girls.

03:04:55.710 --> 03:04:56.351
[SPEAKER_22]: We're done here.

03:04:56.451 --> 03:04:58.751
[SPEAKER_22]: And sorry, Nintendo Mania, I can't help you with your laptop.

03:04:59.891 --> 03:05:01.852
[SPEAKER_22]: Call your local computer experts.

03:05:02.452 --> 03:05:02.712
[SPEAKER_22]: All right.

03:05:03.973 --> 03:05:04.873
[SPEAKER_22]: Final thoughts, you guys.

[SPEAKER_16]: I like my PSP.

[SPEAKER_16]: Extifer, your final thought.

03:05:14.155 --> 03:05:14.675
[SPEAKER_04]: Stop it.

03:05:16.076 --> 03:05:18.376
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like his PSP.

03:05:20.297 --> 03:05:21.097

03:05:24.392 --> 03:05:26.196
[SPEAKER_22]: I have too many GameStop receipts.

03:05:26.677 --> 03:05:28.039

[SPEAKER_22]: That does it for another... Hold on.

03:06:00.954 --> 03:06:01.674
[SPEAKER_22]: That was two.

03:06:01.834 --> 03:06:02.555
[SPEAKER_22]: That was two.

03:06:02.975 --> 03:06:03.835
[SPEAKER_22]: You pick one.

03:06:04.135 --> 03:06:05.256
[SPEAKER_22]: You pick one or the other.

03:06:05.296 --> 03:06:07.337
[SPEAKER_06]: I had to quote the game, but it's itchy.

03:06:08.637 --> 03:06:13.519
