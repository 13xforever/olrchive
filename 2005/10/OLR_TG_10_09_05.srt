11
00:00:44,893 --> 00:00:45,774
[SPEAKER_05]: Not going anywhere.

12
00:00:46,194 --> 00:00:47,095
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right, still here.

[SPEAKER_04]: That's right, I'm here.

15
00:00:49,957 --> 00:00:50,277
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

16
00:00:50,677 --> 00:00:52,078
[SPEAKER_03]: We're still working on that.

17
00:00:52,699 --> 00:00:53,760
[SPEAKER_04]: PSP community for responding so well.

18
00:01:21,681 --> 00:01:24,944
[SPEAKER_04]: and those of you guys that are downloading the show onto your PSP, enjoy.

19
00:01:25,304 --> 00:01:27,646
[SPEAKER_04]: Great use for your PSP, all this stuff.

20
00:01:27,706 --> 00:01:29,608
[SPEAKER_03]: Still working on more stuff for it, too.

21
00:01:30,008 --> 00:01:31,970
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Loki's still working on that website.

22
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:36,314
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we're looking at maybe a shell box and looking at chat, possibly.

23
00:01:36,694 --> 00:01:37,074
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

24
00:01:37,455 --> 00:01:42,139
[SPEAKER_04]: So check out olrpsp.com and celebrate olrpsp.com.

25
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:43,340
[SPEAKER_04]: How about a giveaway?

26
00:01:43,953 --> 00:01:44,293
[SPEAKER_03]: DeathJunior.com

27
00:02:11,886 --> 00:02:12,627
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just that easy.

28
00:02:12,747 --> 00:02:13,607
[SPEAKER_04]: We won't spam you.

29
00:02:13,647 --> 00:02:15,489
[SPEAKER_04]: We won't put you on any list or anything.

30
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:18,051
[SPEAKER_04]: Just send us an email and you might win.

31
00:02:18,751 --> 00:02:21,814
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you put a funny message in there that uses bad grammar, I will laugh at you.

32
00:02:22,774 --> 00:02:23,175
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

33
00:02:24,573 --> 00:02:27,795
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's start off tonight's show talking about how our gaming week was going.

34
00:02:27,835 --> 00:02:29,195
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, how's your gaming week been?

35
00:02:29,596 --> 00:02:30,876
[SPEAKER_05]: Busy, actually.

36
00:02:30,936 --> 00:02:35,238
[SPEAKER_05]: I had the week off of school, so I basically sat around and did, you know, crap all day.

37
00:02:35,938 --> 00:02:40,300
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, of course I had work, but I played some Nintendogs, although I do not know where my DS is now.

38
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:40,681
[SPEAKER_05]: Oops.

39
00:02:41,221 --> 00:02:43,002
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I locked my DS in the drawer at work.

40
00:02:43,102 --> 00:02:43,862
[SPEAKER_05]: Did the dog eat it?

41
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:45,079
[SPEAKER_05]: What dog?

42
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:46,280
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a cat.

43
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,581
[SPEAKER_05]: She'd probably run in fear.

44
00:02:48,621 --> 00:02:50,703
[SPEAKER_05]: She does look alarmed whenever the puppies bark.

45
00:02:51,603 --> 00:02:52,283
[SPEAKER_05]: She's a little jealous.

46
00:02:52,323 --> 00:02:53,004
[SPEAKER_05]: I think she hid it.

47
00:02:53,084 --> 00:02:54,765
[SPEAKER_05]: She hid it in her litter box and took a big shit on it.

48
00:02:56,886 --> 00:02:59,408
[SPEAKER_04]: You're remembering to feed your cat, right, as well as the dogs?

49
00:02:59,508 --> 00:02:59,848
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

50
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:03,330
[SPEAKER_05]: The cat doesn't let me forget because she hops on the bed and goes, Mom!

51
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:04,571
[SPEAKER_05]: Feed me!

52
00:03:04,971 --> 00:03:05,471
[SPEAKER_05]: Like that.

53
00:03:06,432 --> 00:03:10,994
[SPEAKER_05]: I've also finally opened my copy of We Love Katamari.

54
00:03:11,014 --> 00:03:12,755
[SPEAKER_04]: And what do you think?

55
00:03:13,015 --> 00:03:13,836
[SPEAKER_05]: Cracked out.

56
00:03:14,758 --> 00:03:16,179
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

57
00:03:42,643 --> 00:03:44,805
[SPEAKER_05]: Dedicating a virtual car we can never afford.

58
00:03:44,825 --> 00:03:46,647
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, actually, technically, we can't afford one right now.

59
00:03:47,447 --> 00:03:49,389
[SPEAKER_05]: However, in the real world.

60
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:52,632
[SPEAKER_04]: Like an Xbox 360 and a PlayStation 3 and a Revolution.

61
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:54,774
[SPEAKER_05]: Xbox 360 does not come first on that list.

62
00:03:56,836 --> 00:03:57,957
[SPEAKER_05]: Release date-wise, yes.

63
00:03:59,078 --> 00:04:00,739
[SPEAKER_05]: Opinion-wise, no.

64
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:02,941
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything else you've been gaming with this week?

65
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:10,026
[SPEAKER_05]: God, yeah, playing lots of Taiko No Tatsu, Taiko Drum Master, I have the US one.

66
00:04:10,766 --> 00:04:11,727
[SPEAKER_05]: Your roommate, Extifer.

67
00:04:11,947 --> 00:04:12,148
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

68
00:04:12,488 --> 00:04:15,431
[SPEAKER_05]: We have our Firefly Monday, Firefly Friday.

69
00:04:15,731 --> 00:04:15,871
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

70
00:04:16,092 --> 00:04:22,838
[SPEAKER_05]: And afterwards, we went out, we kidnapped my husband and all went out to Lions and came back.

71
00:04:22,918 --> 00:04:23,599
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is a restaurant.

72
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:23,919
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

73
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:24,180
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

74
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:34,572
[SPEAKER_05]: Late Night Lions on Firefly Friday and played lots of Taiko no Tatsujin and my hands were all bruised and we were watching the cracked out opening, sleep deprived, thinking, oh, that's so cute.

75
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:36,955
[SPEAKER_04]: How does the Japanese version compare to the English version?

76
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:39,037
[SPEAKER_05]: When was the last time Jamie played the Japanese version?

77
00:04:39,398 --> 00:04:39,998
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you haven't played it?

78
00:04:40,239 --> 00:04:40,619
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought you had.

79
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:41,260
[SPEAKER_04]: I've played both.

80
00:04:42,122 --> 00:04:43,083
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't had time.

81
00:04:43,423 --> 00:04:46,624
[SPEAKER_04]: The English one is a little bit scaled down compared to the Japanese ones.

82
00:04:46,725 --> 00:04:48,145
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a lot scaled down.

83
00:04:48,245 --> 00:04:49,106
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's still cute.

84
00:04:49,266 --> 00:04:51,767
[SPEAKER_05]: It's cute, but I'm going to go on and import the others.

85
00:04:51,847 --> 00:04:53,848
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't honestly have much interest in it beforehand.

86
00:04:54,869 --> 00:04:58,271
[SPEAKER_05]: But now that, I mean, I played it before, but I just was like, eh.

87
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:03,253
[SPEAKER_04]: The arcade one is a heck of a lot of fun because the Taiko drum is like, Taiko, it's actual size.

88
00:05:03,574 --> 00:05:04,494
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a heck of a lot of fun.

89
00:05:04,534 --> 00:05:05,735
[SPEAKER_04]: I like playing the arcade version.

90
00:05:06,095 --> 00:05:11,578
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, I only know of like one arcade, and that's in LA, which is not exactly around the corner from us, so.

91
00:05:12,176 --> 00:05:13,716
[SPEAKER_03]: They need to bring out the PSP version here.

92
00:05:14,217 --> 00:05:14,797
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a lot of fun.

93
00:05:15,777 --> 00:05:18,258
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not the same when you've got a game like that on the PSP.

94
00:05:18,998 --> 00:05:22,058
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not the same when you've got a game like that on the PSP because there's no taiko drum.

95
00:05:23,299 --> 00:05:24,019
[SPEAKER_03]: It still works.

96
00:05:24,239 --> 00:05:29,020
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, Dan's been playing Castlevania Dawn of Sorrow.

97
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,481
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm definitely going to touch on that later because I picked that up too.

98
00:05:32,581 --> 00:05:33,381
[SPEAKER_05]: It's looking pretty nice.

99
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:35,202
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you get a chance to play yourself yet?

100
00:05:36,382 --> 00:05:37,562
[SPEAKER_05]: I turned it on in the bathroom.

101
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:39,643
[SPEAKER_05]: He left the DS in there.

102
00:05:40,123 --> 00:05:40,323
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

103
00:05:41,469 --> 00:05:48,114
[SPEAKER_05]: I trip over the thing because we have this hanging basket in our bathroom and he had it sticking out and I ran into it and knocked it across the floor.

104
00:05:48,134 --> 00:05:53,578
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, oh shit, did I break down the DS?

105
00:05:53,638 --> 00:05:55,319
[SPEAKER_05]: I keep the cat box in the bathroom too.

106
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,901
[SPEAKER_05]: I was afraid I knocked it into the cat litter.

107
00:05:58,882 --> 00:05:59,142
[SPEAKER_05]: Oops.

108
00:05:59,542 --> 00:05:59,762
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

109
00:06:00,523 --> 00:06:02,004
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

110
00:06:02,044 --> 00:06:03,545
[SPEAKER_04]: Narrowly safe there, the DS.

111
00:06:04,566 --> 00:06:05,726
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been playing World of Warcraft too.

112
00:06:05,987 --> 00:06:06,507
[SPEAKER_04]: How's that going?

113
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:08,826
[SPEAKER_05]: www.DarkSakura.com

114
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,162
[SPEAKER_04]: So strange to me, but interesting.

115
00:06:37,242 --> 00:06:42,166
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's pretty cool, because the thing is that it was passing to any character in the game.

116
00:06:42,326 --> 00:06:44,728
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, you know, people can teleport in real life.

117
00:06:45,808 --> 00:06:54,695
[SPEAKER_05]: But the thing is that it was passing on to any standing character in the game that anyone talks to.

118
00:06:55,196 --> 00:06:57,398
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was passing to the NPCs.

119
00:06:58,988 --> 00:07:15,054
[SPEAKER_05]: and that's how it was spreading, is that people would contract whatever that is, heal themselves, they would contract it, teleport in, talk to the NPC, heal themselves, the NPC gets it, passes it on, because it cuts something like 200 and something life each time it drops.

120
00:07:15,474 --> 00:07:17,475
[SPEAKER_05]: For someone who's level 50, that doesn't matter.

121
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:20,536
[SPEAKER_05]: For someone who's just starting off, that's instant death.

122
00:07:21,456 --> 00:07:22,897
[SPEAKER_05]: And it keeps happening.

123
00:07:23,564 --> 00:07:27,385
[SPEAKER_05]: So they counteracted it by having them infected with something else.

124
00:07:28,405 --> 00:07:30,426
[SPEAKER_05]: It's fixed, but I never had to worry about it.

125
00:07:30,846 --> 00:07:31,266
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

126
00:07:32,806 --> 00:07:33,926
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, what have you been playing this week?

127
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:36,147
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been playing Burnout Revenge.

128
00:07:37,107 --> 00:07:38,748
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you play anything besides Burnout?

129
00:07:39,468 --> 00:07:41,888
[SPEAKER_03]: I played Burnout Legends.

130
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:44,849
[SPEAKER_04]: You're becoming a broken record.

131
00:07:45,789 --> 00:07:46,209
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

132
00:07:46,509 --> 00:07:50,950
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I play this during the week, and I don't have time to play stuff at home.

133
00:07:51,371 --> 00:07:52,691
[SPEAKER_03]: I really wish I did, but...

134
00:07:53,834 --> 00:07:54,634
[SPEAKER_03]: I play Nintendogs.

135
00:07:55,594 --> 00:07:56,475
[SPEAKER_03]: Taco's still alive.

136
00:07:57,355 --> 00:07:58,975
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kind of done with Nintendogs now.

137
00:07:58,995 --> 00:07:59,415
[SPEAKER_04]: Me too.

138
00:07:59,475 --> 00:07:59,835
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm done.

139
00:08:00,275 --> 00:08:01,516
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really care about Taco anymore.

140
00:08:01,556 --> 00:08:03,056
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess the virtual pet thing wasn't for me.

141
00:08:04,436 --> 00:08:07,737
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just I lost the attention to it because you can't really do that much.

142
00:08:07,997 --> 00:08:10,538
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still a great game, but it's just, I don't know.

143
00:08:10,578 --> 00:08:13,738
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fun to throw bones and stuff at their head, but it's just, you know.

144
00:08:13,818 --> 00:08:14,478
[SPEAKER_04]: The Bark Ball.

145
00:08:14,638 --> 00:08:15,579
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all about the Bark Ball.

146
00:08:15,619 --> 00:08:18,519
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe if there's expansions later on that your dog can learn to do more things.

147
00:08:18,559 --> 00:08:19,760
[SPEAKER_05]: When you quit playing, give me all your stuff.

148
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:20,900
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

149
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,320
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

150
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:21,860
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

151
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:27,322
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just waiting for Animal Crossing.

152
00:08:28,022 --> 00:08:29,823
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so looking forward to the Wi-Fi.

153
00:08:29,943 --> 00:08:30,603
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be awesome.

154
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:34,785
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be cool, except, I mean, how's that going to work with people coming to your town?

155
00:08:34,825 --> 00:08:37,606
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we could have people destroying towns.

156
00:08:37,686 --> 00:08:39,827
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure they have tested this thing into the ground.

157
00:08:40,207 --> 00:08:41,187
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll have a way to do it.

158
00:08:41,387 --> 00:08:43,148
[SPEAKER_05]: Folks can interact with us in our town.

159
00:08:43,228 --> 00:08:48,870
[SPEAKER_04]: You probably can only allow certain... You probably get to allow who comes into your town and which trains can run into your town.

160
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:50,050
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be interesting.

161
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:51,071
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like Bark Mode.

162
00:08:51,892 --> 00:08:52,152
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe.

163
00:08:52,672 --> 00:08:53,993
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's going to be like Bark Mode.

164
00:08:54,013 --> 00:08:56,074
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to be in like Town Mode or something.

165
00:08:56,114 --> 00:08:57,775
[SPEAKER_04]: But Wi-Fi somehow.

166
00:08:59,796 --> 00:09:03,518
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously you can't run when your DS is off, so you'd be able to monitor who's coming in and out of your town.

167
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:04,878
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be interesting.

168
00:09:05,078 --> 00:09:06,659
[SPEAKER_03]: No retro game stuff pisses me off.

169
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,060
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

170
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:09,320
[SPEAKER_03]: Bad Nintendo.

171
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:09,961
[SPEAKER_03]: Bad.

172
00:09:10,381 --> 00:09:13,022
[SPEAKER_05]: But I got to play against Mario Voice.

173
00:09:13,923 --> 00:09:14,323
[SPEAKER_04]: At E3?

174
00:09:14,423 --> 00:09:15,623
[SPEAKER_05]: At E3.

175
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:16,884
[SPEAKER_05]: And you said I was lovely.

176
00:09:16,984 --> 00:09:18,585
[SPEAKER_04]: The whole reason I bought...

177
00:09:19,338 --> 00:09:19,858
[SPEAKER_04]: and DarkSakura.com.

178
00:09:44,966 --> 00:09:46,027
[SPEAKER_04]: Animal Crossing was such a great game.

179
00:09:46,787 --> 00:09:49,349
[SPEAKER_04]: God, I would still be playing it if there was just a little more to do.

180
00:09:49,369 --> 00:09:53,372
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope they bring out a really expansive version of it later on.

181
00:09:53,812 --> 00:09:58,035
[SPEAKER_03]: For any of those companies out there, I'm willing to advertise in my town for your products.

182
00:09:58,916 --> 00:09:59,216
[SPEAKER_03]: Shut up.

183
00:10:02,321 --> 00:10:03,322
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

184
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:25,543
[SPEAKER_05]: And the thing is, I don't know if anyone's ever listened to when they speak in the U.S.

185
00:10:25,563 --> 00:10:27,884
[SPEAKER_05]: when they're actually saying every letter in the words that they're speaking.

186
00:10:28,564 --> 00:10:34,047
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, in the Japanese one, now they do say it very fast, it's hard to catch it, but they're saying every syllable.

187
00:10:34,147 --> 00:10:37,509
[SPEAKER_05]: They're actually speaking Japanese when they talk to you.

188
00:10:38,269 --> 00:10:39,029
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's very fast.

189
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:39,770
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just very fast.

190
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:40,590
[SPEAKER_04]: Cartoon-y style.

191
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:41,931
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

192
00:10:41,991 --> 00:10:44,392
[SPEAKER_05]: However, if you listen carefully enough, you can actually hear them talking.

193
00:10:45,793 --> 00:10:47,074
[SPEAKER_04]: Slow it down, record it, slow it down.

194
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:49,675
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything else you've been playing this week, Logie?

195
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:54,181
[SPEAKER_04]: My week, a few games I want to talk about.

196
00:10:54,241 --> 00:10:55,882
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to follow up on Lost in Blue.

197
00:10:55,902 --> 00:11:03,746
[SPEAKER_04]: It was something that I kind of touched on last week, but I didn't really get to give a more in-depth impression of it because I feel like I didn't get to play enough of it.

198
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:05,727
[SPEAKER_04]: So I played a little more Lost in Blue.

199
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:07,848
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry to say it didn't really hold my interest.

200
00:11:08,448 --> 00:11:11,510
[SPEAKER_04]: I would have to say borderline not recommend Lost in Blue.

201
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:14,291
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there is an audience for this game out there.

202
00:11:15,154 --> 00:11:22,459
[SPEAKER_04]: It really reminds me of an old-school computer point-and-click game, like an old-school King's Quest, Loom-style game.

203
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:31,546
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's definitely some creative things to be done with the stylus, like digging in the sand and starting the fire and some of the things you do.

204
00:11:31,606 --> 00:11:39,131
[SPEAKER_04]: But I was just really bored with the story, and it seemed like I got so close to dying.

205
00:11:39,191 --> 00:11:39,391
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

206
00:11:39,591 --> 00:11:40,572
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you get the milk a goat?

207
00:11:41,593 --> 00:11:43,594
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't get that far to the milk and the goat part, no.

208
00:11:44,595 --> 00:11:44,675
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh.

209
00:11:45,191 --> 00:11:48,374
[SPEAKER_03]: I heard it was almost impossible to milk the goat.

210
00:11:48,934 --> 00:11:52,177
[SPEAKER_04]: The game, honestly, I didn't really want to play it that much longer.

211
00:11:52,197 --> 00:11:53,618
[SPEAKER_04]: It just really didn't hold my interest.

212
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:56,561
[SPEAKER_04]: So I can't really recommend Lost in Blue.

213
00:11:56,601 --> 00:11:59,443
[SPEAKER_04]: But I do think there are people out there that would like this type of game.

214
00:12:00,044 --> 00:12:06,750
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm not going to completely say avoid it, but I'm going to say borderline non-recommend because I think there are people out there that might enjoy it.

215
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:10,213
[SPEAKER_04]: If you like those old-style computer point-and-click games, you actually might get a kick out of this.

216
00:12:10,713 --> 00:12:11,714
[SPEAKER_04]: You might like this more than I did.

217
00:12:12,549 --> 00:12:37,872
[SPEAKER_04]: and I did like some King's Quest games and some of that stuff I just wasn't like really into it so that's why I can't King's Quest bored the tears out of me but I love Loom see I love King's Quest 4 like that is an awesome game and some of the other King's Quest in fact I have a King's Quest related story for later but we'll talk about that in a minute the other game I played based on a recommendation in the forums I didn't even know this game was out but a Tecmo Arcade Collection I think it's the official name Tecmo Collection something along those lines

218
00:12:38,533 --> 00:12:39,473
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

219
00:12:54,338 --> 00:12:55,318
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's pretty awesome.

220
00:13:13,703 --> 00:13:16,965
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's kind of how I felt playing a lot of these games in the Tecmo Collection.

221
00:13:16,985 --> 00:13:20,586
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, boy, I remember this game being a lot better.

222
00:13:21,607 --> 00:13:24,768
[SPEAKER_04]: And granted, you go into a game like Rygar.

223
00:13:24,828 --> 00:13:29,150
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, Rygar on the NES was completely different than it was in the arcade.

224
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:34,573
[SPEAKER_04]: The arcade was like a side-scroller action-based game, where the Nintendo one was...

225
00:13:35,262 --> 00:13:35,763
[SPEAKER_04]: and DarkSakura.

226
00:14:00,182 --> 00:14:02,862
[SPEAKER_04]: They're really like gems hidden in this collection that are very cool.

227
00:14:02,882 --> 00:14:06,903
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I like Solomon's Key, the arcade version is very cool and some of the other stuff in there as well.

228
00:14:07,603 --> 00:14:10,624
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's my biggest problem with the Tecmo collection.

229
00:14:11,084 --> 00:14:22,846
[SPEAKER_04]: It's $29.99 not $19.99 and I honestly think $29.99 is a little high when you consider that most of the retro at least where I paid for it, it was $29.99 and there were other retro collections sitting right next to it.

230
00:14:22,886 --> 00:14:25,287
[SPEAKER_04]: The Midway one, the Namco one for $19.99 and I just

231
00:14:28,214 --> 00:14:32,056
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think the price additional is really justified with this.

232
00:14:32,096 --> 00:14:33,337
[SPEAKER_04]: So what if it has Tecmo Bowl?

233
00:14:33,457 --> 00:14:36,199
[SPEAKER_04]: I think $19.99 is a more fair price to be charging for this game.

234
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:47,985
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to borderline recommend it just because I think there are some good titles in here that a lot of folks might remember from the NES, but they never got to play the arcade versions of some of these games.

235
00:14:48,285 --> 00:14:49,426
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it's worth checking out.

236
00:14:49,466 --> 00:14:51,387
[SPEAKER_04]: There are a lot of really good gems in this series.

237
00:14:52,468 --> 00:14:56,490
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's nothing to drop everything and go right out and buy.

238
00:14:57,708 --> 00:14:58,489
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

239
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,120
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

240
00:15:31,178 --> 00:15:36,822
[SPEAKER_04]: I was so bored with this game, I forced myself to play the game a little bit longer, but I was just like, this is stupid.

241
00:15:37,483 --> 00:15:39,624
[SPEAKER_04]: Why is this a game on the DS?

242
00:15:40,044 --> 00:15:43,267
[SPEAKER_04]: This should be a game that's a flash thing on somebody's website.

243
00:15:43,547 --> 00:15:45,648
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't believe somebody will waste their money on Sprung.

244
00:15:45,969 --> 00:15:49,491
[SPEAKER_04]: I definitely do not recommend, avoid like the plague, Sprung.

245
00:15:49,551 --> 00:15:50,191
[SPEAKER_04]: It's awful.

246
00:15:50,432 --> 00:15:51,312
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not even a game.

247
00:15:51,633 --> 00:15:56,356
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a scenario-based borefest.

248
00:15:57,182 --> 00:16:00,263
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep in mind that those games are very, very popular in Japan.

249
00:16:00,343 --> 00:16:02,824
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but they're also better in Japan.

250
00:16:02,884 --> 00:16:04,205
[SPEAKER_05]: He has Tokimeki Memorial.

251
00:16:04,665 --> 00:16:06,546
[SPEAKER_04]: You get to see boobs in the Japanese one.

252
00:16:06,566 --> 00:16:08,887
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't even get that here.

253
00:16:08,907 --> 00:16:11,828
[SPEAKER_05]: They did a Tokimeki for girls.

254
00:16:13,048 --> 00:16:18,631
[SPEAKER_04]: And in this one, you can play as the girl or the guy, but it doesn't matter.

255
00:16:18,851 --> 00:16:19,691
[SPEAKER_04]: Both stories suck.

256
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:20,891
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's the girl one.

257
00:16:20,951 --> 00:16:24,513
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, she actually has to convince the guy to have sex with her because...

258
00:16:26,352 --> 00:16:28,994
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if they ever got it on, I just didn't care.

259
00:16:29,474 --> 00:16:31,615
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted that game out of my DS, it's that bad.

260
00:16:32,516 --> 00:16:36,719
[SPEAKER_04]: And for the record, the only game I've played that's worse than that is Pink Pals.

261
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,721
[SPEAKER_03]: Chatroom Sim.

262
00:16:40,401 --> 00:16:44,824
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, PictoChat plus crappy minigames.

263
00:16:45,144 --> 00:16:45,584
[SPEAKER_04]: What is that?

264
00:16:45,644 --> 00:16:46,025
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on.

265
00:16:46,945 --> 00:16:49,327
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, last game, Castlevania Don Isaro.

266
00:16:50,526 --> 00:16:52,687
[SPEAKER_04]: Finally, a really, really good game I played this week.

267
00:16:52,767 --> 00:17:03,591
[SPEAKER_04]: If you liked the most recent Castlevania game that they put out on the Game Boy Advance, where you're collecting the souls and absorbing the souls, you're going to like this one because it's the exact same freaking thing.

268
00:17:03,751 --> 00:17:05,212
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a continuation in that story.

269
00:17:05,292 --> 00:17:17,176
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's an absolute continuation of the story, except they added the magic seal thing, which is kind of hokey, but they did some other touchscreen elements, like certain souls that you absorb, you use the touchscreen as part of it, and that's kind of neat.

270
00:17:17,617 --> 00:17:18,577
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can play as Alucard.

271
00:17:19,395 --> 00:17:20,316
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I didn't get that far yet.

272
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:26,921
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe, because Dan showed me something on one of the sites, I believe that Alucard is an unlockable character in that game.

273
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:28,202
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's cool.

274
00:17:28,342 --> 00:17:28,822
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I hope so.

275
00:17:28,842 --> 00:17:32,385
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you meet with the other people and you can switch off like in Castlevania 3.

276
00:17:32,425 --> 00:17:33,185
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cool.

277
00:17:33,205 --> 00:17:35,627
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't gotten that far in the game yet, but I do know I like this game.

278
00:17:36,188 --> 00:17:39,530
[SPEAKER_04]: Symphony of the Night, one of the greatest video games ever, in my opinion.

279
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:48,717
[SPEAKER_04]: And although I haven't followed the advanced games so well, I did like this most recent one they had, the Aria of Sorrow, but

280
00:17:49,691 --> 00:17:50,212
[SPEAKER_04]: I like this.

281
00:17:50,312 --> 00:17:51,433
[SPEAKER_04]: The continuation, it's great.

282
00:17:51,453 --> 00:17:54,795
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's extra features, like a versus and a soul trading thing.

283
00:17:55,376 --> 00:17:55,776
[SPEAKER_04]: It's great.

284
00:17:56,297 --> 00:17:59,760
[SPEAKER_04]: For Castlevania fans, especially if you're a fan of Symphony Night, this one doesn't disappoint.

285
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,904
[SPEAKER_04]: My only complaints is that the drawing thing is a little bit hokey.

286
00:18:07,446 --> 00:18:08,587
[SPEAKER_04]: That's about it, honestly.

287
00:18:08,847 --> 00:18:09,428
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a great game.

288
00:18:09,488 --> 00:18:11,009
[SPEAKER_04]: I recommend Castlevania Dinosaur.

289
00:18:11,385 --> 00:18:17,808
[SPEAKER_05]: I still love the opinion they need to do a US release of what was the Saturn version of Symphony of the Night in Japan.

290
00:18:18,048 --> 00:18:19,268
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, where you could play as Maria, right?

291
00:18:19,409 --> 00:18:19,629
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

292
00:18:20,309 --> 00:18:24,711
[SPEAKER_05]: That game, the one problem I had with it is that the 3D effects were not as good.

293
00:18:24,731 --> 00:18:26,452
[SPEAKER_05]: The 2D effects were much better.

294
00:18:26,912 --> 00:18:29,133
[SPEAKER_05]: The sound was infinitely better because as...

295
00:18:30,013 --> 00:18:34,897
[SPEAKER_05]: The sound processor and 2D graphics in the Saturn were far superior to the PlayStation.

296
00:18:36,077 --> 00:18:40,881
[SPEAKER_05]: But it had so much more to offer that I think that game would sell very well if it comes out over here.

297
00:18:41,021 --> 00:18:45,564
[SPEAKER_04]: You know a complaint I heard about Castlevania and Dinosaur... Symphony of the Night?

298
00:18:45,944 --> 00:18:46,765
[SPEAKER_04]: No, not Symphony of the Night.

299
00:18:46,785 --> 00:18:47,925
[SPEAKER_04]: Castlevania and Dinosaur.

300
00:18:47,945 --> 00:18:49,346
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know why I'm correcting myself.

301
00:18:50,767 --> 00:18:53,289
[SPEAKER_04]: A complaint I heard was you don't get to use a whip.

302
00:18:54,009 --> 00:18:56,211
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's not a Castlevania game if you don't use a whip.

303
00:18:57,665 --> 00:18:59,967
[SPEAKER_04]: It is totally a Castlevania game.

304
00:19:00,427 --> 00:19:01,288
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't get that argument.

305
00:19:01,428 --> 00:19:05,370
[SPEAKER_03]: You do unlock a character who is one of the Belmonts, and you do get to use a whip.

306
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:06,391
[SPEAKER_04]: So what?

307
00:19:06,411 --> 00:19:07,491
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't get to use a whip.

308
00:19:07,511 --> 00:19:09,873
[SPEAKER_04]: The swords play practically the exact same way.

309
00:19:09,913 --> 00:19:10,513
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't get that.

310
00:19:10,993 --> 00:19:11,514
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait a second.

311
00:19:11,534 --> 00:19:13,755
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to use a whip in Symphony of the Night.

312
00:19:13,795 --> 00:19:14,135
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

313
00:19:14,175 --> 00:19:14,716
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, you do.

314
00:19:15,316 --> 00:19:17,397
[SPEAKER_04]: Richter is an unlockable character.

315
00:19:17,597 --> 00:19:19,078
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, still, that's the same thing, though.

316
00:19:19,819 --> 00:19:21,620
[SPEAKER_04]: And you play through Richter's story.

317
00:19:22,268 --> 00:19:24,811
[SPEAKER_04]: Symphony of the Night is the greatest Castlevania game, period.

318
00:19:24,992 --> 00:19:25,432
[SPEAKER_04]: Period.

319
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:26,033
[SPEAKER_04]: Ever.

320
00:19:26,133 --> 00:19:28,616
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

321
00:19:28,696 --> 00:19:31,380
[SPEAKER_04]: Not even Simon's Quest, not even Castlevania 3, not even the original.

322
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,563
[SPEAKER_05]: Dracula X was infinitely better.

323
00:19:33,743 --> 00:19:36,967
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I, I, you show me Dracula X, I still think Symphony of the Night is the best.

324
00:19:36,987 --> 00:19:39,951
[SPEAKER_05]: Dracula X was the last true Castlevania game.

325
00:19:42,062 --> 00:19:42,482
[SPEAKER_04]: Possibly.

326
00:19:43,303 --> 00:19:43,963
[SPEAKER_04]: I could see that argument.

327
00:19:43,984 --> 00:19:45,545
[SPEAKER_04]: But not the Super Nintendo version.

328
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,246
[SPEAKER_04]: Not the Super Nintendo version.

329
00:19:47,346 --> 00:19:47,806
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, no.

330
00:19:48,027 --> 00:19:58,254
[SPEAKER_05]: And even that was good, but when you started getting into the whole Metroid-style gameplay, it became... You can't... I don't think there's a comparison.

331
00:19:59,936 --> 00:20:03,799
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, we've got to get into some other actual news going on this week.

332
00:20:04,299 --> 00:20:07,862
[SPEAKER_04]: As much as I could argue about Castlevania all night long... Hi, we're nerds.

333
00:20:07,902 --> 00:20:08,602
[SPEAKER_05]: We do a radio show.

334
00:20:08,642 --> 00:20:09,683
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk about it.

335
00:20:09,983 --> 00:20:10,884
[SPEAKER_04]: And hi, you're a nerd.

336
00:20:10,904 --> 00:20:11,685
[SPEAKER_04]: You're listening to it.

337
00:20:12,717 --> 00:20:13,177
[SPEAKER_04]: Nerd!

338
00:20:13,377 --> 00:20:13,477
[SPEAKER_04]: Geek!

339
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:45,192
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank God I did not vote for him.

340
00:20:54,642 --> 00:20:54,922
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

341
00:20:54,962 --> 00:21:00,487
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, honestly, I could say I didn't vote for him either, but it was written by a Democratic assemblyman.

342
00:21:01,188 --> 00:21:02,789
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really a bipartisan thing.

343
00:21:02,969 --> 00:21:07,593
[SPEAKER_04]: I just think there's... I don't think everything was truly being considered with this.

344
00:21:07,893 --> 00:21:11,236
[SPEAKER_04]: I just think there could have been a better option to do what they wanted to do.

345
00:21:12,177 --> 00:21:12,957
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm cool with them.

346
00:21:13,518 --> 00:21:15,820
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how much I want to rehash the same topic, though, honestly.

347
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,342
[SPEAKER_04]: Just go listen to an old podcast.

348
00:21:18,362 --> 00:21:19,283
[SPEAKER_04]: I know I've talked about it before.

349
00:21:19,303 --> 00:21:21,565
[SPEAKER_05]: I just have a quick description for it.

350
00:21:21,645 --> 00:21:21,805
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

351
00:21:24,261 --> 00:21:24,882
[SPEAKER_05]: Getting more voters.

352
00:21:26,823 --> 00:21:29,725
[SPEAKER_04]: But that could be said of either party in this case.

353
00:21:30,186 --> 00:21:32,567
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the media kind of plays to this.

354
00:21:32,688 --> 00:21:36,350
[SPEAKER_05]: He's taking the popular opinion and using the media hype to gain himself some more voters.

355
00:21:38,392 --> 00:21:39,092
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows?

356
00:21:39,213 --> 00:21:39,953
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a loser.

357
00:21:41,414 --> 00:21:44,176
[SPEAKER_04]: GameStop and EB Games, the merger was approved.

358
00:21:45,057 --> 00:21:48,119
[SPEAKER_04]: We talked previously that GameStop was going to buy EB Games.

359
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,040
[SPEAKER_04]: It was approved.

360
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:49,961
[SPEAKER_04]: The merger went through.

361
00:21:51,942 --> 00:21:53,343
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if the names are changing, though.

362
00:21:53,363 --> 00:21:54,024
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think they are.

363
00:21:54,892 --> 00:21:55,513
[SPEAKER_04]: Gizmondo White Screen

364
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:20,287
[SPEAKER_05]: You have a widescreen Gizmondo.

365
00:22:20,667 --> 00:22:22,388
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like the PSP.

366
00:22:23,288 --> 00:22:24,048
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's funny.

367
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:35,510
[SPEAKER_05]: I like the phrase, though, that the rumors that Gizmondo is $210 million in the hole isn't going to stop the release on time.

368
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:37,571
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure the Phantom console is worse in the hole.

369
00:22:37,831 --> 00:22:41,011
[SPEAKER_03]: The only reason it's widescreen is they're trying to compete with the Pop Station.

370
00:22:43,192 --> 00:22:44,372
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

371
00:22:44,912 --> 00:22:48,593
[SPEAKER_05]: Taking a look at the image of the widescreen Gizmondo

372
00:22:49,497 --> 00:22:52,220
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to say, you know, and see, I liked the Gizmondo.

373
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,081
[SPEAKER_05]: I had absolutely no problem with it.

374
00:22:54,542 --> 00:22:55,743
[SPEAKER_05]: This thing does look pretty sleek.

375
00:22:56,804 --> 00:22:58,125
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but does it have sight talking?

376
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:01,968
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, they definitely changed the look of that from what they were showing at E3.

377
00:23:01,988 --> 00:23:09,875
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what's funny is I remember the original shots of the PSP back when it was conceptual still.

378
00:23:10,136 --> 00:23:11,837
[SPEAKER_03]: They had shots of fish as well.

379
00:23:12,438 --> 00:23:15,240
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's kind of ironic in that picture of the widescreen Gizmondo.

380
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:15,981
[SPEAKER_03]: There's fish on it.

381
00:23:16,567 --> 00:23:18,108
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe that is a favorable sign.

382
00:23:18,368 --> 00:23:20,049
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you going to be picking one of these up, DarkSakura?

383
00:23:20,549 --> 00:23:21,089
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope so.

384
00:23:21,189 --> 00:23:29,853
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, ever since I got to play it at E3 and played that game, Johnny Whatever, that had the karaoke mode, we're sort of like guitar freaks.

385
00:23:30,453 --> 00:23:31,593
[SPEAKER_04]: What other games are on this thing?

386
00:23:31,613 --> 00:23:33,774
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the only one I really know anything about is the Johnny Whatever.

387
00:23:33,794 --> 00:23:34,735
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, see?

388
00:23:35,095 --> 00:23:36,636
[SPEAKER_04]: And what's the golden rule of gaming?

389
00:23:36,696 --> 00:23:38,316
[SPEAKER_04]: We brought this up on the three-hour show this week.

390
00:23:38,556 --> 00:23:41,178
[SPEAKER_05]: A system is only as good as the games that are on it.

391
00:23:41,278 --> 00:23:43,779
[SPEAKER_04]: So I want to hear less about the Gizmondo and more about the games.

392
00:23:44,279 --> 00:23:44,419
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

393
00:23:45,078 --> 00:23:45,819
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

394
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:04,603
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, what's going on in the hack and crack scene?

395
00:24:04,623 --> 00:24:07,926
[SPEAKER_04]: I know there was, of course, the mandatory PSP update that happened.

396
00:24:08,046 --> 00:24:08,366
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, 2.01.

397
00:24:08,786 --> 00:24:14,311
[SPEAKER_03]: It adds no features whatsoever other than fixing the hole that allows you to do stuff with your PSP.

398
00:24:15,932 --> 00:24:22,878
[SPEAKER_03]: Other than that, since people love the hack of the firmware, they're doing some more cosmetic modifications.

399
00:24:23,118 --> 00:24:28,082
[SPEAKER_03]: The first one is they have a guide to removing the broken icons.

400
00:24:28,202 --> 00:24:30,264
[SPEAKER_03]: It requires you to hex edit your

401
00:24:30,874 --> 00:24:37,716
[SPEAKER_03]: firmware and the runner program and basically just blanked out those icons instead of actually having them pop up.

402
00:24:38,277 --> 00:24:41,938
[SPEAKER_03]: The other one is, you know those little wavy lines that are on there that prevent burn in?

403
00:24:42,258 --> 00:24:43,919
[SPEAKER_03]: You can get rid of those too as well.

404
00:24:44,719 --> 00:24:45,999
[SPEAKER_03]: Just more cosmetic stuff.

405
00:24:46,219 --> 00:24:47,080
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the wavy lines.

406
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,341
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, but some people don't.

407
00:24:49,461 --> 00:24:50,101
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know what?

408
00:24:50,921 --> 00:24:52,041
[SPEAKER_03]: They just want to remove them.

409
00:24:52,162 --> 00:24:54,762
[SPEAKER_03]: So, by golly, they're going to do it.

410
00:24:55,823 --> 00:24:56,263
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah.

411
00:24:57,527 --> 00:25:05,656
[SPEAKER_04]: We were talking earlier in the show a little bit about Nintendogs, and I was saying that I get a little burned out on Nintendogs, but the fun is just beginning for some of our other friends, right, Jamie?

412
00:25:06,136 --> 00:25:06,476
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

413
00:25:07,237 --> 00:25:11,061
[SPEAKER_05]: On the 7th, Nintendogs was just released in Europe.

414
00:25:12,522 --> 00:25:12,663
[SPEAKER_05]: And...

415
00:25:14,949 --> 00:25:17,270
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, didn't you post some photos from that in your blog?

416
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:19,690
[SPEAKER_03]: It was friggin' cute is what it was.

417
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:24,351
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, they had some pictures of the people bringing their dogs with them.

418
00:25:25,212 --> 00:25:27,952
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just absolutely adorable.

419
00:25:28,373 --> 00:25:34,914
[SPEAKER_03]: They've got one where the dog's actually sniffing the... or licking the... Oh my god!

420
00:25:35,354 --> 00:25:36,715
[SPEAKER_03]: Dog licking the DS!

421
00:25:37,195 --> 00:25:39,776
[SPEAKER_03]: Trying to be a celebrity.

422
00:25:39,796 --> 00:25:41,476
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, any word on how this game is selling?

423
00:25:41,997 --> 00:25:42,758
[SPEAKER_05]: Over in Europe.

424
00:25:42,998 --> 00:25:43,618
[SPEAKER_05]: Taking a look.

425
00:25:43,738 --> 00:25:46,320
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, this is a cute picture of a puppy in a soccer ball.

426
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:47,241
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

427
00:25:47,321 --> 00:25:48,682
[SPEAKER_05]: I love that game so much.

428
00:25:51,323 --> 00:25:53,625
[SPEAKER_05]: It got an 8 out of 10 by Eurogamer.

429
00:25:54,361 --> 00:25:55,742
[SPEAKER_05]: Just to read the small paragraph.

430
00:26:16,985 --> 00:26:23,608
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we're enchanted by it since it's a highly engaging and entertaining game and one that makes excellent use of the DS's unique capabilities.

431
00:26:23,908 --> 00:26:24,808
[SPEAKER_05]: Plus, it's got puppies in it.

432
00:26:26,449 --> 00:26:27,209
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that sums it up.

433
00:26:27,389 --> 00:26:37,873
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, I will add, they did throw a puppy party to celebrate the launch of this game, which featured such wonderful events as dog-loving celebrities.

434
00:26:38,573 --> 00:26:44,755
[SPEAKER_03]: They had actual canine celebrities as well, some dogs from different shows and stuff.

435
00:26:45,325 --> 00:26:54,468
[SPEAKER_03]: They had dog's eye video screens, a very important pooch chill out area, and the doggy Olympics as well as a doggy disco.

436
00:26:55,148 --> 00:26:55,308
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

437
00:26:55,328 --> 00:26:56,149
[SPEAKER_04]: Doggy disco?

438
00:26:56,589 --> 00:26:57,469
[SPEAKER_03]: Doggy disco.

439
00:26:57,789 --> 00:27:03,271
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, because Nintendogs is so big, there's other people out there that want to steal some of Nintendogs Thunder, correct?

440
00:27:05,152 --> 00:27:05,812
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, there are.

441
00:27:05,872 --> 00:27:07,713
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm also trying to find the numbers, by the way.

442
00:27:07,933 --> 00:27:08,293
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, well, no.

443
00:27:08,633 --> 00:27:09,293
[SPEAKER_05]: But, yeah, 03...

444
00:27:11,883 --> 00:27:12,884
[SPEAKER_05]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

445
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,162
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there screenshots up there on your screen there?

446
00:27:33,202 --> 00:27:40,868
[SPEAKER_05]: Hanadeka Club is sort of like The Dog with the fisheye camera, so it's all the puppies done the same way.

447
00:27:41,568 --> 00:27:44,691
[SPEAKER_05]: There are eight breeds to choose from, including Pugs, Chihuahua, Shih Tzu.

448
00:27:46,532 --> 00:27:52,957
[SPEAKER_05]: The dogs can talk with their owners, find out about their likes and dislikes, and will play games of fetch, frisbee, balls, and bones.

449
00:27:53,858 --> 00:27:57,101
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure that it's crap compared to the other one.

450
00:27:57,681 --> 00:27:59,743
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, because I do like the Hanadeka Club.

451
00:28:01,143 --> 00:28:03,326
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd look at it, I wouldn't, you know.

452
00:28:03,906 --> 00:28:14,659
[SPEAKER_05]: But this actually is, so far it looks like that it's out, it will be released this holiday season.

453
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:15,520
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

454
00:28:17,302 --> 00:28:19,483
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on, there's some other stuff coming out for the DS.

455
00:28:20,184 --> 00:28:21,365
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought this was very interesting.

456
00:28:21,465 --> 00:28:27,550
[SPEAKER_04]: Square Enix, as we call them, Squeenix, but Square Enix is actually putting out a game called Mario Basket 3 vs. 3.

457
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:32,353
[SPEAKER_04]: So shock, it's something that's not a role-playing game, although it's not the first time they haven't done a role-playing game.

458
00:28:32,393 --> 00:28:33,294
[SPEAKER_04]: But very interesting.

459
00:28:33,314 --> 00:28:37,637
[SPEAKER_04]: They're kind of doing this little basketball-looking game, and it's a three-on-three game using the DS.

460
00:28:38,378 --> 00:28:39,719
[SPEAKER_04]: Should be interesting.

461
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:42,181
[SPEAKER_04]: It has a very Mario Kart-style look to it.

462
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:45,695
[SPEAKER_04]: which I think is very interesting considering it's being developed not by Nintendo but by Square.

463
00:28:46,536 --> 00:28:48,397
[SPEAKER_05]: We did get Mario Baseball.

464
00:28:48,997 --> 00:28:49,397
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.

465
00:28:49,557 --> 00:28:49,837
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.

466
00:28:49,877 --> 00:28:50,618
[SPEAKER_04]: That just recently came out.

467
00:28:51,118 --> 00:28:57,741
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, Nintendo is unveiling a new Wario Land game that's coming out very soon and that'll also be on the DS.

468
00:28:58,081 --> 00:28:59,442
[SPEAKER_04]: So, should be interesting.

469
00:29:00,359 --> 00:29:02,900
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to mention this for PSP, our friends on the PSP.

470
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:08,481
[SPEAKER_04]: Detel has released a 4GB hard drive for the PSP.

471
00:29:09,341 --> 00:29:19,304
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, because this is a hard drive, it also has a battery that goes with it, and it's supposed to boost your time that you play, or it's supposed to boost the loading times as well using the hard drive.

472
00:29:19,324 --> 00:29:26,066
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's twice the battery power for one, because it's basically this giant battery that sticks out of your battery port there.

473
00:29:26,286 --> 00:29:26,886
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

474
00:29:26,966 --> 00:29:29,628
[SPEAKER_03]: Then it's also got a 4GB drive in there as well.

475
00:29:29,708 --> 00:29:36,651
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, the only bad thing about Daytel is they've got really bad... They have a really bad track record with their batteries.

476
00:29:36,811 --> 00:29:38,372
[SPEAKER_03]: Their batteries tend to explode.

477
00:29:38,652 --> 00:29:39,193
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my gosh!

478
00:29:39,753 --> 00:29:47,357
[SPEAKER_03]: So, hopefully this won't have the explosive feature in it, but hey, more storage space is always good.

479
00:29:47,377 --> 00:29:48,858
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just expensive.

480
00:29:49,918 --> 00:29:51,399
[SPEAKER_04]: And speaking of which, no price changes.

481
00:29:51,846 --> 00:29:53,227
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

482
00:30:17,268 --> 00:30:22,790
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you want to store tons of crap... Especially since you can't buy actual 4GB hard drives anymore.

483
00:30:23,271 --> 00:30:24,491
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you could, they'd be like $15.

484
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:39,337
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they're releasing that one peripheral that the team executor is working on that's actually going to be using CompactFlash and MicroDrives, which go up to 6GB.

485
00:30:40,057 --> 00:30:42,318
[SPEAKER_03]: And those are a little bit less expensive.

486
00:30:42,358 --> 00:30:45,079
[SPEAKER_03]: But actually, if you get that on there...

487
00:30:45,464 --> 00:30:56,508
[SPEAKER_03]: and then you add the, there's an adapter you can make or buy that converts laptop drives to work with CompactFlash, you can in a sense have, you know, a 30 gig, 120 gig drive.

488
00:30:56,668 --> 00:31:04,331
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, you'd be spending that, you know, upwards to about $500 for it, but, you know, hey, if you want more space, I mean, that's one way to do it.

489
00:31:04,751 --> 00:31:06,492
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

490
00:31:07,572 --> 00:31:13,074
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, I'm looking to see here real quick, because I know they had that going for it.

491
00:31:13,354 --> 00:31:14,595
[SPEAKER_03]: They also had actually

492
00:31:17,379 --> 00:31:21,282
[SPEAKER_03]: The PSP TV stuff, they've announced a price point for that as well.

493
00:31:22,203 --> 00:31:22,764
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, what was that?

494
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:23,765
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you know the price for that?

495
00:31:23,805 --> 00:31:25,246
[SPEAKER_03]: The price for that is going to be $119.

496
00:31:25,466 --> 00:31:27,228
[SPEAKER_03]: They're taking pre-orders right now.

497
00:31:27,668 --> 00:31:30,891
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the things that they added to it is an S-video out, so you can have that.

498
00:31:30,931 --> 00:31:36,617
[SPEAKER_03]: Plus, the swappable, you can do 4.3 or 16.9 aspect ratios.

499
00:31:37,137 --> 00:31:39,840
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of money, but going to a different company...

500
00:31:40,322 --> 00:31:51,388
[SPEAKER_04]: There's rumors going around this week, and I think some of it comes back to Joystick ran an article, that's Joystick with a Q, .com ran an article about Nintendo possibly releasing the Revolution for $99.

501
00:31:53,769 --> 00:31:54,930
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm.

502
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:56,811
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of a rumor that's going around right now.

503
00:31:57,211 --> 00:32:03,714
[SPEAKER_04]: Wouldn't that be very interesting, though, because the Xbox 360 is going to be, what, $300 for the core, $400 for a little more?

504
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:10,422
[SPEAKER_04]: PlayStation 3, we don't know yet, but we can expect it will probably be about the same.

505
00:32:10,842 --> 00:32:19,026
[SPEAKER_04]: So what a way for Nintendo to catch up by being kind of the last one out the gate to really, you know, create interest in their system because it would only be $100.

506
00:32:19,066 --> 00:32:20,127
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you imagine that?

507
00:32:20,147 --> 00:32:21,227
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be very smart.

508
00:32:21,828 --> 00:32:22,368
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd have to...

509
00:32:23,118 --> 00:32:37,869
[SPEAKER_05]: The only thing I can think of logically is if the system is not that expensive to make for parts and labor and however much they would pay per system for marketing and then for shipping, sales.

510
00:32:38,149 --> 00:32:41,051
[SPEAKER_05]: You'd have to see what their overhead is in this.

511
00:32:41,512 --> 00:32:48,517
[SPEAKER_05]: However, you can make enough product with even a minute profit to make back and pull a good profit.

512
00:32:49,278 --> 00:32:50,359
[SPEAKER_05]: by selling more units.

513
00:33:13,357 --> 00:33:14,439
[SPEAKER_04]: If this is really true.

514
00:33:14,599 --> 00:33:16,322
[SPEAKER_05]: Even so, it's comparable.

515
00:33:16,382 --> 00:33:17,123
[SPEAKER_04]: That's half.

516
00:33:17,143 --> 00:33:18,224
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very competitive.

517
00:33:18,245 --> 00:33:19,106
[SPEAKER_04]: That's half as much.

518
00:33:19,607 --> 00:33:23,853
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be a real way for Nintendo to gain some ground if they were going to be the last ones out the gate, but

519
00:33:25,164 --> 00:33:25,564
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows?

520
00:33:25,724 --> 00:33:28,565
[SPEAKER_04]: There's the whole innovation thing with the controller.

521
00:33:28,605 --> 00:33:34,127
[SPEAKER_05]: But on top of that, Nintendo has always been oriented toward more family child games.

522
00:33:34,407 --> 00:33:44,349
[SPEAKER_05]: What parent is going to want to buy their small child a $350 system when they can get a $150 system that would be easier to play?

523
00:33:44,429 --> 00:33:44,909
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.

524
00:33:44,989 --> 00:33:47,970
[SPEAKER_03]: I have something to add here.

525
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:50,631
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think we've heard everything about the revolution yet.

526
00:33:51,406 --> 00:33:51,906
[SPEAKER_03]: and so on.

527
00:34:21,243 --> 00:34:28,668
[SPEAKER_03]: Game Company out there, they're referring to one of the big three, is actually going to be using this in their next console.

528
00:34:30,049 --> 00:34:40,296
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think what it's going to be is, and this is my theory, is that they're going to have, it's not going to be as powerful photorealistic-wise, but it's going to be 3D.

529
00:34:41,416 --> 00:34:42,157
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.

530
00:34:42,977 --> 00:34:45,099
[SPEAKER_03]: Which will be why you need a 3D remote.

531
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:46,460
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

532
00:34:47,338 --> 00:34:48,699
[SPEAKER_04]: Peter Jackson's King Kong Demo

533
00:35:11,286 --> 00:35:12,046
[SPEAKER_05]: Available for download.

534
00:35:12,106 --> 00:35:17,489
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's probably hitting a lot of the major game sites because I actually saw a little clip of the game in action.

535
00:35:17,549 --> 00:35:18,970
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks very nice.

536
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:26,554
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to see what the Xbox 360 might look like by using your PC, kind of, because the graphics are supposed to be comparable, check it out on your PC.

537
00:35:26,654 --> 00:35:29,935
[SPEAKER_05]: There's also a teaser for Tomb Raider Legends X360.

538
00:35:30,756 --> 00:35:32,497
[SPEAKER_04]: And teaser would be not playable though, right?

539
00:35:32,517 --> 00:35:33,257
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a little trailer?

540
00:35:33,457 --> 00:35:37,139
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, but it is there to see some of the stuff.

541
00:35:37,199 --> 00:35:40,861
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, one I'm kind of interested in myself is the Possession Zombie Takedown.

542
00:35:41,843 --> 00:35:42,443
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

543
00:36:01,378 --> 00:36:15,390
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, what are you going to tell the kids about tonight?

544
00:36:16,031 --> 00:36:18,793
[SPEAKER_05]: Today's piece of advice is how to jump from a moving train.

545
00:36:19,273 --> 00:36:22,756
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you never know when you're going to be having to jump from the train, or throw Mama from the train.

546
00:36:24,298 --> 00:36:29,222
[SPEAKER_05]: Number one, make your jump from the end of the last, the rear car.

547
00:36:30,231 --> 00:36:30,952
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously.

548
00:36:31,772 --> 00:36:32,172
[SPEAKER_01]: Duh.

549
00:36:32,413 --> 00:36:35,294
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't jump from the middle.

550
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:35,995
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.

551
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:39,897
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait for the train to slow as it rounds the bend in the tracks if you have time.

552
00:36:41,278 --> 00:36:42,919
[SPEAKER_05]: Pick your landing spot.

553
00:36:43,379 --> 00:36:47,722
[SPEAKER_05]: The ideal spot is relatively soft and free of obstructions.

554
00:36:48,503 --> 00:36:50,964
[SPEAKER_05]: Get as low to the floor as possible, bending your knees.

555
00:36:52,885 --> 00:36:58,449
[SPEAKER_05]: Jump perpendicular, that's sideways, children, to the train, leaping as far as you can.

556
00:36:59,071 --> 00:37:01,772
[SPEAKER_05]: Cover your head with your arms and roll like a log when you land.

557
00:37:02,552 --> 00:37:04,732
[SPEAKER_05]: But my final, final piece of advice.

558
00:37:04,952 --> 00:37:05,172
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

559
00:37:05,712 --> 00:37:08,473
[SPEAKER_05]: If you hitchhike and stick to cars, much easier.

560
00:37:08,493 --> 00:37:09,633
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't have to jump from a train.

561
00:37:11,574 --> 00:37:11,854
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

562
00:37:12,474 --> 00:37:13,434
[SPEAKER_04]: Looking for that piece of advice.

563
00:37:14,414 --> 00:37:16,895
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, what's going on with the Xbox 360?

564
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:25,357
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you like to talk about homebrew stuff for PSP, but now it sounds like there's independent stuff going on for the 360.

565
00:37:26,117 --> 00:37:26,677
[SPEAKER_04]: What's this about?

566
00:37:26,957 --> 00:37:28,338
[SPEAKER_03]: XBOX Live Arcade Marble Blast Ultra

567
00:37:54,346 --> 00:37:55,346
[SPEAKER_04]: That may not be a bad thing, though.

568
00:37:55,366 --> 00:37:56,407
[SPEAKER_04]: Marble Madness is excellent.

569
00:38:15,557 --> 00:38:18,298
[SPEAKER_03]: Project Gotham Racing 3, and this game looks friggin' awesome.

570
00:38:18,618 --> 00:38:23,080
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of a combo between Asteroids, Rez, and Fantavision.

571
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,780
[SPEAKER_03]: Just tons of explosions on the screen.

572
00:38:26,401 --> 00:38:33,103
[SPEAKER_03]: The other ones that they were showing off, which actually is pretty cool, is Joust, the classic Atari game.

573
00:38:33,323 --> 00:38:33,824
[SPEAKER_04]: Right on.

574
00:38:34,524 --> 00:38:35,424
[SPEAKER_03]: So you gotta love that.

575
00:38:35,544 --> 00:38:37,605
[SPEAKER_04]: Now they have Joust, but do they have Burger Time?

576
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,581
[SPEAKER_03]: No Burger King yet.

577
00:38:40,621 --> 00:38:41,021
[SPEAKER_03]: Sucks.

578
00:38:41,181 --> 00:38:41,282
[SPEAKER_03]: Sucks.

579
00:38:41,302 --> 00:38:41,682
[SPEAKER_03]: Beer Tapper.

580
00:38:41,702 --> 00:38:42,562
[SPEAKER_04]: Worst system ever.

581
00:38:42,802 --> 00:38:43,183
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm kidding.

582
00:38:43,203 --> 00:38:51,568
[SPEAKER_03]: But actually, one of the things I was going to mention is the Xbox hard drive that they're coming out with, it does come with some other features.

583
00:38:51,848 --> 00:38:53,569
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I was looking about this.

584
00:38:53,649 --> 00:38:56,011
[SPEAKER_04]: What's this, like Hexic or something?

585
00:38:56,071 --> 00:38:56,531
[SPEAKER_03]: Hexen.

586
00:38:57,351 --> 00:38:58,612
[SPEAKER_04]: No, Hexen's a different game.

587
00:39:00,133 --> 00:39:00,473
[SPEAKER_03]: Hexen.

588
00:39:00,774 --> 00:39:02,174
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a Tetris game.

589
00:39:02,215 --> 00:39:03,956
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually done by the guy that did Tetris.

590
00:39:04,596 --> 00:39:05,977
[SPEAKER_03]: There's going to be actually videos available.

591
00:39:06,598 --> 00:39:07,659
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

592
00:39:30,138 --> 00:39:33,399
[SPEAKER_04]: But all this crap's getting preloaded on if you buy the hard drive.

593
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:37,560
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and it's either if you buy it with the system or by itself.

594
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,440
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to be on there.

595
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:44,822
[SPEAKER_03]: So you get a game, which is kind of cool, but you need the hard drive if you're going to play any of these games because you've got to download them to your hard drive.

596
00:39:44,902 --> 00:39:46,162
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, the arcade stuff, yeah.

597
00:39:46,282 --> 00:39:46,923
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

598
00:39:46,963 --> 00:39:51,164
[SPEAKER_03]: The other game that they showed was Wick and the Fable of Souls, and I have no idea what that was.

599
00:39:51,204 --> 00:39:55,245
[SPEAKER_03]: It just looks like some RPG or shooter game that has a tree in it.

600
00:39:55,485 --> 00:39:55,665
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

601
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:58,018
[SPEAKER_03]: SkyTree, that's all I know.

602
00:39:58,919 --> 00:39:59,800
[SPEAKER_04]: Good way to sum that up.

603
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,541
[SPEAKER_03]: It's interesting.

604
00:40:01,601 --> 00:40:15,171
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, the other thing to disappoint fans, unfortunately, at launch, a couple games have gone bye-bye, and those would be Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter for all those Tom Clancy fans, and, of course, Frame City Killer for all those Namco fans.

605
00:40:16,653 --> 00:40:19,235
[SPEAKER_04]: So, starting to push back a little bit there.

606
00:40:19,255 --> 00:40:20,416
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a good Valentine's Day gift.

607
00:40:21,536 --> 00:40:24,539
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing says I love you like Tom Clancy's Advanced Warfighter.

608
00:40:24,679 --> 00:40:25,139
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure.

609
00:40:25,159 --> 00:40:25,199
[SPEAKER_04]: Um,

610
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,682
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of Xbox, might as well roll on with Microsoft here.

611
00:40:29,722 --> 00:40:33,005
[SPEAKER_04]: This week we had Doom 3 Resurrection of Evil come out.

612
00:40:33,626 --> 00:40:44,775
[SPEAKER_04]: Not too often on the consoles, I mean it's happened before, but not too often do you see expansions coming out for games where you have to already own the first game to play this expansion.

613
00:40:45,435 --> 00:40:47,597
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what's going on with the Doom 3 here.

614
00:40:47,637 --> 00:40:48,097
[SPEAKER_03]: Not quite.

615
00:40:48,418 --> 00:40:48,658
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

616
00:40:49,058 --> 00:40:49,899
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's its own thing.

617
00:40:50,039 --> 00:40:51,600
[SPEAKER_04]: Did I misunderstand the article?

618
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:51,981
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

619
00:40:52,341 --> 00:40:52,881
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, crap.

620
00:40:53,041 --> 00:40:54,443
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually their game's re-release.

621
00:40:54,483 --> 00:40:56,004
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like Ninja Gaiden Black, uh,

622
00:40:56,536 --> 00:40:59,078
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically a re-release with the PC expansion stuff.

623
00:40:59,118 --> 00:41:02,360
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got a couple more weapons and more levels.

624
00:41:03,301 --> 00:41:04,702
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not what somebody else told me.

625
00:41:04,762 --> 00:41:07,584
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody else told me, well, I guess because maybe the PC version was like that.

626
00:41:08,044 --> 00:41:10,026
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, PC version, you have the original one.

627
00:41:10,386 --> 00:41:10,886
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, crap.

628
00:41:11,286 --> 00:41:12,367
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's nothing special then.

629
00:41:12,427 --> 00:41:13,248
[SPEAKER_04]: Just another game coming out.

630
00:41:13,288 --> 00:41:14,429
[SPEAKER_04]: No, Doom 3 was pretty cool.

631
00:41:14,749 --> 00:41:15,589
[SPEAKER_04]: It was kind of scary.

632
00:41:15,649 --> 00:41:16,990
[SPEAKER_03]: It's also, the price point's lower.

633
00:41:17,531 --> 00:41:17,931
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true.

634
00:41:17,951 --> 00:41:18,291
[SPEAKER_03]: It's $29.99.

635
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:19,392
[SPEAKER_03]: That's very true.

636
00:41:19,412 --> 00:41:21,614
[SPEAKER_05]: Comedic in Doom is the movie.

637
00:41:22,494 --> 00:41:22,734
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.

638
00:41:22,754 --> 00:41:23,455
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you see the trailer?

639
00:41:23,555 --> 00:41:24,636
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, forget the movie.

640
00:41:25,016 --> 00:41:25,576
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to see it.

641
00:41:25,636 --> 00:41:25,777
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not.

642
00:41:25,857 --> 00:41:26,237
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not.

643
00:41:26,693 --> 00:41:29,333
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to see it and laugh at it and then watch The Rock for an hour.

644
00:41:29,433 --> 00:41:31,634
[SPEAKER_04]: That first person thing was so hokey.

645
00:41:32,014 --> 00:41:35,155
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

646
00:41:35,335 --> 00:41:38,395
[SPEAKER_04]: If the Halo trailer ends up looking like that, I'm going to laugh.

647
00:41:38,895 --> 00:41:44,176
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I still have to remind our listeners, speaking of movies, Silent Hill coming out next year.

648
00:41:44,736 --> 00:41:54,658
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, didn't you have something about like a... I'm still trying to find more on it, but there's a couple more people listed on IMDb like we can really...

649
00:41:55,393 --> 00:41:58,118
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, say yeah, I am DB, but... Right.

650
00:41:58,238 --> 00:42:06,612
[SPEAKER_05]: They have a link to the article, to the, uh... Not an article, but an interview with Roger Avery that I had touched on a few weeks ago.

651
00:42:06,632 --> 00:42:06,692
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm.

652
00:42:07,874 --> 00:42:07,974
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

653
00:42:10,527 --> 00:42:14,709
[SPEAKER_05]: I remembered us getting as far as some of the other actors in there.

654
00:42:14,729 --> 00:42:19,512
[SPEAKER_05]: We also have Jodell Fairland, Alice Cridge, is that how her name is pronounced?

655
00:42:20,412 --> 00:42:24,994
[SPEAKER_05]: That also goes in a little bit more into the behind-the-scenes cast, but it's still Sean Bean.

656
00:42:25,014 --> 00:42:25,515
[SPEAKER_05]: That's cool.

657
00:42:26,355 --> 00:42:26,655
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

658
00:42:28,697 --> 00:42:31,659
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess at this point, while we're getting a little late in the show, but that's all right.

659
00:42:31,699 --> 00:42:36,062
[SPEAKER_04]: It's never too late to open up the old mailbag and see what's going on, what our listeners have said to us.

660
00:42:36,722 --> 00:42:41,865
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, you can email the show by just sending us an email to go at orange lounge radio dot com.

661
00:42:42,306 --> 00:42:46,268
[SPEAKER_04]: Dark Sakura, she reads and sifts through the mail all day long.

662
00:42:46,408 --> 00:42:51,352
[SPEAKER_04]: Our our hundreds and hundreds of spam and our one or two actual emails that come in.

663
00:42:51,372 --> 00:42:51,772
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm kidding.

664
00:42:52,971 --> 00:42:54,592
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, what's in our email bag this week?

665
00:42:54,872 --> 00:43:02,779
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, our friend Mike from 1up.com, who had that very interesting article about the NDAs, sent me a movie file.

666
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:03,820
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really funny.

667
00:43:04,361 --> 00:43:07,523
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to try to find a way to get this up on our site, hopefully.

668
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:08,765
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure there's a way we can get it up.

669
00:43:09,445 --> 00:43:13,309
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's of one of the Nintendo Micro.

670
00:43:14,209 --> 00:43:15,270
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, the Game Boy Micro.

671
00:43:15,350 --> 00:43:17,272
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I saw one of those today, and I was like, I'm not going to buy that.

672
00:43:17,702 --> 00:43:28,853
[SPEAKER_05]: It involves a maze with a rat with a micro on one side and a piece of cheese on the other and the mouse showing its opinion.

673
00:43:29,974 --> 00:43:30,435
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

674
00:43:31,736 --> 00:43:33,278
[SPEAKER_05]: It was humping the micro.

675
00:43:34,599 --> 00:43:35,140
[SPEAKER_01]: That's lovely.

676
00:43:36,019 --> 00:43:36,539
[SPEAKER_05]: Very lovely.

677
00:43:36,659 --> 00:43:40,840
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that was probably the most messed up thing I've seen all day, but very hilarious.

678
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:44,541
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, in response to Sasuke, I wanted to know what the Click-O-Vision is.

679
00:43:44,601 --> 00:43:46,722
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe we were talking about the Coleco-Vision.

680
00:43:46,882 --> 00:43:48,702
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, the C-O-L-E-C-O-Vision.

681
00:43:49,482 --> 00:43:53,243
[SPEAKER_05]: Coleco also made swimming pools and Cabbage Patch Kids.

682
00:43:53,563 --> 00:43:54,603
[SPEAKER_04]: I knew about the Cabbage Patch Kids.

683
00:43:54,624 --> 00:43:55,644
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't know about the swimming pools.

684
00:43:56,144 --> 00:43:56,444
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

685
00:43:58,845 --> 00:44:02,745
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, a lot of gaming companies make other things you may not know about, like Konami and slot machines.

686
00:44:03,246 --> 00:44:03,646
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

687
00:44:03,966 --> 00:44:04,686
[SPEAKER_04]: I know there's others, but...

688
00:44:05,239 --> 00:44:06,800
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the one that comes to mind because I like to gamble.

689
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:16,665
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, Bradley, not to be confused with Arcadian42, also sent me the link to the GameSpot article about pocket dogs.

690
00:44:17,386 --> 00:44:17,806
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, okay.

691
00:44:17,826 --> 00:44:22,028
[SPEAKER_04]: We like it when the listeners try to clue us in a little bit.

692
00:44:22,089 --> 00:44:22,549
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's cool.

693
00:44:22,629 --> 00:44:23,009
[SPEAKER_04]: We like it.

694
00:44:27,832 --> 00:44:32,594
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, I got another email from Rob with two Bs.

695
00:44:33,215 --> 00:44:33,395
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

696
00:44:35,233 --> 00:44:39,755
[SPEAKER_05]: He actually just had a little bit more about the super huge games.

697
00:44:40,195 --> 00:44:43,396
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I like this one sentence in particular here.

698
00:44:43,496 --> 00:44:45,217
[SPEAKER_05]: The industry is taking sides.

699
00:44:45,657 --> 00:44:48,538
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's Betamax versus VHS all over again.

700
00:44:48,818 --> 00:44:50,859
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, with the HD DVD and Blu-ray?

701
00:44:50,899 --> 00:44:52,319
[SPEAKER_05]: With the formats, exactly.

702
00:44:52,419 --> 00:44:54,440
[SPEAKER_05]: But that does make perfect sense.

703
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:56,160
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, no, it absolutely makes sense.

704
00:44:56,260 --> 00:45:00,482
[SPEAKER_04]: But I really hope before these things get into...

705
00:45:01,314 --> 00:45:02,315
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

706
00:45:28,877 --> 00:45:31,640
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember Penny Arcade and their character, the Divics.

707
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:32,782
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's hilarious.

708
00:45:35,605 --> 00:45:37,848
[SPEAKER_05]: Also about the worst game.

709
00:45:39,109 --> 00:45:42,433
[SPEAKER_05]: See, I always said it was E.T., but he said it was Firefly Magic Carpet.

710
00:45:44,015 --> 00:45:47,980
[SPEAKER_04]: What about Zelda Wanda Gamelon?

711
00:45:49,328 --> 00:45:49,968
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

712
00:45:49,988 --> 00:45:51,209
[SPEAKER_05]: These are pretty rotten ones.

713
00:45:51,229 --> 00:45:54,970
[SPEAKER_04]: Frickin' play Sprung and tell me you didn't just play the worst game.

714
00:45:55,571 --> 00:45:56,331
[SPEAKER_04]: Or Ping Pals.

715
00:45:56,611 --> 00:45:58,912
[SPEAKER_04]: Pick up either one of those and tell me you just didn't play the worst game.

716
00:45:59,572 --> 00:46:02,634
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually, at least Zelda amused me for a few seconds.

717
00:46:03,994 --> 00:46:04,314
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

718
00:46:05,295 --> 00:46:10,317
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, one of our listeners wrote in, Danny, and I want to read this email.

719
00:46:10,437 --> 00:46:10,617
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

720
00:46:10,897 --> 00:46:14,178
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I 100% freaking agree with it, okay?

721
00:46:14,839 --> 00:46:15,059
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

722
00:46:15,379 --> 00:46:15,459
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

723
00:46:17,057 --> 00:46:19,500
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe I speak for some people when I say fuck IGN

724
00:46:22,418 --> 00:46:28,319
[SPEAKER_05]: Just the other day I was trying to read a gaming article when all of a sudden a random yellow circle covered over the text I was reading.

725
00:46:28,759 --> 00:46:30,399
[SPEAKER_05]: As it turned out, this was an ad.

726
00:46:30,519 --> 00:46:32,260
[SPEAKER_05]: An ad that had obscured what I was reading.

727
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:36,100
[SPEAKER_05]: After realizing what it was, I was instantly irritated.

728
00:46:36,281 --> 00:46:40,421
[SPEAKER_05]: IGN is notorious for planting obnoxious advertisements everywhere you try to visit.

729
00:46:40,801 --> 00:46:45,742
[SPEAKER_05]: Clicking a link, viewing an image, forced uncontrollable downloading of a video ad when you want to watch something.

730
00:46:45,902 --> 00:46:49,903
[SPEAKER_04]: To be fair, this is a trend on the internet as a whole that IGN is...

731
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:55,063
[SPEAKER_04]: and I'm sure is not the only gaming site but of course one of the most prevalent.

732
00:46:55,323 --> 00:46:55,863
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't get those.

733
00:46:55,903 --> 00:46:56,564
[SPEAKER_03]: I paid for mine.

734
00:46:57,104 --> 00:46:59,306
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you're a corporate whore anyway.

735
00:47:00,227 --> 00:47:01,308
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's the other thing on here.

736
00:47:01,388 --> 00:47:04,811
[SPEAKER_05]: And how about disallowing QuickTime Media for the majority of the time?

737
00:47:05,671 --> 00:47:09,594
[SPEAKER_05]: On a Macintosh, Windows Media Player is atrocious to use and watch on a Mac.

738
00:47:09,674 --> 00:47:11,716
[SPEAKER_05]: Then again, Windows Media Player is just atrocious, period.

739
00:47:11,756 --> 00:47:12,397
[SPEAKER_05]: That's my opinion.

740
00:47:12,417 --> 00:47:14,138
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I want to bitch about IGN?

741
00:47:14,378 --> 00:47:16,320
[SPEAKER_03]: Is all their downloads stop halfway.

742
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:17,461
[SPEAKER_03]: There's that too.

743
00:47:19,681 --> 00:47:24,344
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's also in here, you'd think with all the advertising IGN puts up that they'd have the bandwidth to allow QuickTime.

744
00:47:25,325 --> 00:47:26,326
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

745
00:47:26,346 --> 00:47:27,487
[SPEAKER_03]: They have QuickTime for everything.

746
00:47:27,827 --> 00:47:28,988
[SPEAKER_03]: Once you're like an insider.

747
00:47:29,028 --> 00:47:30,048
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to be a paid member.

748
00:47:30,068 --> 00:47:30,929
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to pay for it.

749
00:47:31,069 --> 00:47:31,549
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

750
00:47:32,390 --> 00:47:36,052
[SPEAKER_05]: But when this bot came out of nowhere and blocked the article I wanted to read, it was the last straw.

751
00:47:36,092 --> 00:47:41,376
[SPEAKER_05]: A few years ago, IGN was limiting how many images you could view per day, and now they're blocking the text you want to read.

752
00:47:42,103 --> 00:47:42,903
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

753
00:48:02,647 --> 00:48:04,769
[SPEAKER_05]: Really good news on things that are coming out.

754
00:48:04,789 --> 00:48:06,510
[SPEAKER_05]: They have an excellent download section.

755
00:48:07,130 --> 00:48:09,672
[SPEAKER_05]: There's also 1UP, which I actually mentioned looking at 1UP.com.

756
00:48:09,772 --> 00:48:11,073
[SPEAKER_05]: And they've been good to us.

757
00:48:11,313 --> 00:48:12,134
[SPEAKER_04]: 1UP's pretty good.

758
00:48:12,154 --> 00:48:12,654
[SPEAKER_04]: I like 1UP.

759
00:48:12,774 --> 00:48:16,296
[SPEAKER_04]: I also like... I like the ones that are just the facts.

760
00:48:16,436 --> 00:48:18,178
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no pretty picture, just the facts.

761
00:48:18,318 --> 00:48:19,579
[SPEAKER_05]: I like the media-oriented sites.

762
00:48:19,699 --> 00:48:21,860
[SPEAKER_04]: Slashdot and Dig.

763
00:48:22,541 --> 00:48:26,143
[SPEAKER_04]: And some of those ones are just, you know... If you're looking for trailers, GameTrailers.com.

764
00:48:26,163 --> 00:48:27,224
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, GameTrailers.com.

765
00:48:27,244 --> 00:48:29,745
[SPEAKER_04]: If you just want movies and you don't gotta pay, and it's great.

766
00:48:29,825 --> 00:48:31,466
[SPEAKER_04]: So there are all alternatives out there.

767
00:48:31,547 --> 00:48:32,067
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course,

768
00:48:32,671 --> 00:48:34,452
[SPEAKER_04]: and other independent podcasts.

769
00:48:35,272 --> 00:48:35,732
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

770
00:48:35,852 --> 00:48:37,673
[SPEAKER_05]: Support your independent podcaster.

771
00:48:37,733 --> 00:48:38,293
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, please do.

772
00:48:38,313 --> 00:48:39,194
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

773
00:48:40,034 --> 00:48:40,674
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a good email.

774
00:48:40,754 --> 00:48:41,014
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

775
00:48:41,635 --> 00:48:44,516
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, I have to say that voiced.

776
00:48:44,996 --> 00:48:46,797
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, also, use Mozilla.

777
00:48:48,277 --> 00:48:51,018
[SPEAKER_04]: Use Mozilla and there's an extension you can use.

778
00:48:51,158 --> 00:48:55,920
[SPEAKER_04]: I use this to block flash, like ad block.

779
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,162
[SPEAKER_04]: Search for ad block Mozilla on Google and you'll find this.

780
00:48:59,522 --> 00:49:02,343
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a thing that allows you to block

781
00:49:05,083 --> 00:49:15,586
[SPEAKER_04]: like Mozilla as it is you can right click on an image and block it from ever seeing it but Adblock takes it like one step further where you can block plugins on the page and things so you can get rid of those little quick time movies and stuff.

782
00:49:15,626 --> 00:49:16,186
[SPEAKER_04]: It's beautiful.

783
00:49:16,526 --> 00:49:16,766
[SPEAKER_04]: Love it.

784
00:49:17,587 --> 00:49:18,947
[SPEAKER_05]: I really like Firefox for that.

785
00:49:18,967 --> 00:49:32,050
[SPEAKER_04]: You just right click on it and you go to block images from I understand the websites are just trying to make their money and that's perfectly fine but at the same time there's smart ways of doing it and there's annoying ways of doing it.

786
00:49:32,366 --> 00:49:34,766
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, opening up IGN should not crash my computer.

787
00:49:35,927 --> 00:49:36,547
[SPEAKER_05]: Amen to that.

788
00:49:37,927 --> 00:49:38,287
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything else?

789
00:49:38,687 --> 00:49:44,228
[SPEAKER_05]: We also got another email about ThePlay2O, and actually I'm so dumb I just closed the email.

790
00:49:44,748 --> 00:49:46,389
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll try to credit you next week, I'm sorry.

791
00:49:47,749 --> 00:49:53,170
[SPEAKER_05]: About ThePlay2O, combines water play with the world of video games featuring flashing lights and sounds.

792
00:49:53,690 --> 00:49:56,771
[SPEAKER_05]: Directional water jets move characters through traps and mazes.

793
00:49:57,791 --> 00:49:57,871
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

794
00:49:58,598 --> 00:49:59,138
[SPEAKER_02]: That's weird.

795
00:49:59,158 --> 00:50:04,201
[SPEAKER_05]: There's Pokemon, Super Mario Brothers, Donkey Kong, and in Canada only, SpongeBob SquarePants.

796
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:15,488
[SPEAKER_05]: But after looking at this thing, though, it looks like those little toys that you used to get in the 80s that you'd push the button and it shot water up into the thing.

797
00:50:15,628 --> 00:50:17,389
[SPEAKER_05]: Now this one, it's electronic.

798
00:50:17,429 --> 00:50:18,750
[SPEAKER_05]: You control the direction on it.

799
00:50:19,230 --> 00:50:24,414
[SPEAKER_05]: This still makes me think of those things where you squish the water and try to hit the loop and put it on a pike or something.

800
00:50:24,434 --> 00:50:24,494
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm.

801
00:50:25,802 --> 00:50:26,302
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds weird.

802
00:50:26,563 --> 00:50:29,705
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd have to really see this thing in action, but that's really what it's making me think of.

803
00:50:30,566 --> 00:50:34,729
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if I want to... I don't feel like getting in the pool to just try this out.

804
00:50:34,749 --> 00:50:34,969
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

805
00:50:35,269 --> 00:50:38,471
[SPEAKER_05]: But you go to play20, the letter O, dot com.

806
00:50:38,752 --> 00:50:39,032
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

807
00:50:41,474 --> 00:50:41,974
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything else?

808
00:50:43,335 --> 00:50:47,138
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I do, but I think I will let somebody else talk for a moment.

809
00:50:47,738 --> 00:50:48,299
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no, go ahead.

810
00:50:48,399 --> 00:50:48,679
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead.

811
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:49,479
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you insist?

812
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:50,200
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I insist.

813
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:50,880
[SPEAKER_05]: Must you?

814
00:50:50,901 --> 00:50:51,141
[SPEAKER_05]: I do.

815
00:50:51,241 --> 00:50:51,421
[SPEAKER_04]: I do.

816
00:50:52,188 --> 00:50:54,189
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have it up, so you've got the email up.

817
00:50:54,509 --> 00:50:56,830
[SPEAKER_04]: There was one that was emailed to me, right?

818
00:50:57,890 --> 00:51:00,031
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought you just accidentally closed the email box.

819
00:51:00,091 --> 00:51:00,692
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, sorry.

820
00:51:01,832 --> 00:51:03,093
[SPEAKER_04]: I can get it up real fast here.

821
00:51:03,133 --> 00:51:03,393
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

822
00:51:03,993 --> 00:51:06,434
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I'm glad that your roommate's not in the room when you say that.

823
00:51:06,454 --> 00:51:07,494
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it was... Shut up.

824
00:51:07,534 --> 00:51:08,575
[SPEAKER_03]: Why you guys are doing that?

825
00:51:09,175 --> 00:51:09,575
[SPEAKER_03]: Here it is.

826
00:51:09,855 --> 00:51:10,196
[SPEAKER_04]: I got it.

827
00:51:10,296 --> 00:51:11,156
[SPEAKER_04]: It was... Fine.

828
00:51:13,957 --> 00:51:15,678
[SPEAKER_04]: It was Shallon Monks.

829
00:51:15,818 --> 00:51:18,139
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a question from Steven S...

830
00:51:19,103 --> 00:51:22,726
[SPEAKER_04]: Who, by the way, has a hilarious email address, but of course I'm not going to read it on air, but it's hilarious.

831
00:51:23,306 --> 00:51:30,530
[SPEAKER_04]: It says, In Shaolin Monks, I've been playing with my friend, and every time he gets a fatality, mutality, or brutality, he gets it, and my character doesn't.

832
00:51:30,650 --> 00:51:34,313
[SPEAKER_04]: If you can help me figure this out, it would be much appreciated, because I'm about ready to give up on this game.

833
00:51:35,413 --> 00:51:39,896
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, I played Mortal Kombat Shaolin Monks, and the fatality thing was really ticking me off, too.

834
00:51:40,717 --> 00:51:43,999
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, you're going to have to check that out on GameFAQ.

835
00:51:44,879 --> 00:51:47,041
[SPEAKER_04]: GameFAQSGameFacts.com

836
00:51:48,081 --> 00:51:52,262
[SPEAKER_04]: because I unfortunately do not know the answer, and I'm okay with admitting that, that I do not know the answer.

837
00:51:52,622 --> 00:51:54,423
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, go for it.

838
00:51:55,083 --> 00:51:55,623
[SPEAKER_04]: Check that out.

839
00:51:56,023 --> 00:52:02,085
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you find out, let me know, because I want to know why I can't keep, why I can't unlock any more fatalities in that game.

840
00:52:02,425 --> 00:52:03,845
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just being stupid or something, I don't know.

841
00:52:04,625 --> 00:52:05,485
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got a couple more.

842
00:52:05,505 --> 00:52:07,746
[SPEAKER_05]: I have, um, this week's UK releases.

843
00:52:08,006 --> 00:52:08,186
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

844
00:52:08,706 --> 00:52:09,786
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've touched on a few of them.

845
00:52:09,806 --> 00:52:15,828
[SPEAKER_05]: We have, uh, Brat Angels, Combat Elite, uh, World War II Paratroopers, Driver 3, uh, uh, uh,

[SPEAKER_05]: Rush, Pokemon Emerald And as I scroll down to see if there's anything else...

848
00:52:46,995 --> 00:52:47,516
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god.

849
00:52:48,436 --> 00:52:50,338
[SPEAKER_05]: UFO Aftershock X3 Reunion.

850
00:52:51,059 --> 00:52:52,139
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are all coming out next week.

851
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:53,040
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, sounds good.

852
00:52:53,060 --> 00:52:56,083
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, we're starting to get kind of late on the show here.

853
00:52:56,303 --> 00:52:57,364
[SPEAKER_04]: I have one last one.

854
00:52:57,384 --> 00:52:57,704
[SPEAKER_04]: One last one.

855
00:52:57,724 --> 00:52:58,185
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a quick one.

856
00:52:58,205 --> 00:52:58,705
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, make it quick.

857
00:52:59,105 --> 00:53:03,229
[SPEAKER_05]: The Australian High Court, to our Australian listeners, hello everybody.

858
00:53:04,270 --> 00:53:05,831
[SPEAKER_05]: PlayStation mod chips are legal, guys.

859
00:53:06,291 --> 00:53:08,213
[SPEAKER_05]: You can mod the hell out of your PlayStation.

860
00:53:08,393 --> 00:53:09,074
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's all legal.

861
00:53:09,454 --> 00:53:11,215
[SPEAKER_05]: The whole thing behind that is it was...

862
00:53:12,236 --> 00:53:21,105
[SPEAKER_05]: Their decision found that PlayStation chips' functions were circumvented by mod chips to allow unauthorized games to be played are not primarily copy protection devices.

863
00:53:21,566 --> 00:53:25,370
[SPEAKER_05]: They really don't give a rat's ass whatever you play on your system as long as it's not bootlegged.

864
00:53:25,470 --> 00:53:27,472
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, have fun down under with your mod chips.

865
00:53:27,632 --> 00:53:28,633
[SPEAKER_05]: Import those games.

866
00:53:28,693 --> 00:53:30,074
[SPEAKER_04]: Have fun.

867
00:53:30,615 --> 00:53:32,176
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a few quick stories for you guys here.

868
00:53:32,196 --> 00:53:33,017
[SPEAKER_04]: We're trying to wind down here.

869
00:53:33,057 --> 00:53:35,079
[SPEAKER_04]: I do want to say one other thing about the PSP.

870
00:53:36,072 --> 00:53:36,272
[SPEAKER_04]: P-Safe P-1.1

871
00:54:03,164 --> 00:54:03,745
[SPEAKER_03]: PS3, PS4, PS5, PS6, PS7

872
00:54:24,128 --> 00:54:39,019
[SPEAKER_03]: and one of the things that they were demonstrating could be the possible evolution in the eye toy which is they actually had a demonstration where the eye toy took a picture of the person and recreated a 3D model of their head just like completely accurately

873
00:54:39,611 --> 00:54:47,233
[SPEAKER_03]: and they're just saying that this is possible that later on something like this could be used in the PS3 to actually put you in the game.

874
00:54:47,373 --> 00:54:48,413
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean... That's freaky.

875
00:54:48,673 --> 00:54:49,053
[SPEAKER_04]: It's okay.

876
00:54:49,173 --> 00:54:49,634
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well.

877
00:54:50,114 --> 00:54:50,434
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

878
00:54:51,754 --> 00:54:52,154
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything else?

879
00:54:52,754 --> 00:54:53,695
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all I've got.

880
00:54:53,775 --> 00:54:54,055
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

881
00:54:54,375 --> 00:54:56,195
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know they've been trying to do that for years.

882
00:54:56,235 --> 00:54:58,056
[SPEAKER_05]: They had that thing with the Game Boy camera.

883
00:54:58,756 --> 00:54:59,176
[SPEAKER_05]: What was that?

884
00:54:59,196 --> 00:54:59,936
[SPEAKER_05]: What was it?

885
00:54:59,956 --> 00:55:00,936
[SPEAKER_05]: Imperfect Dark, wasn't it?

886
00:55:01,437 --> 00:55:02,177
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but that was...

887
00:55:03,642 --> 00:55:05,882
[SPEAKER_04]: And they've done it for some other eye toys.

888
00:55:05,963 --> 00:55:06,823
[SPEAKER_03]: Facial skinning.

889
00:55:06,843 --> 00:55:08,303
[SPEAKER_03]: They have that for the eye toy now.

890
00:55:08,343 --> 00:55:10,403
[SPEAKER_04]: But boy, that's just like pasting your face.

891
00:55:10,483 --> 00:55:13,144
[SPEAKER_04]: But the 3D modeling and everything, that's crazy stuff.

892
00:55:13,184 --> 00:55:15,204
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, this is a 3D head.

893
00:55:15,344 --> 00:55:17,705
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, this is not just some stupid mapping.

894
00:55:17,925 --> 00:55:20,205
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to see how fat I look in a video game, okay?

895
00:55:20,905 --> 00:55:22,026
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't need no 3D model.

896
00:55:22,106 --> 00:55:28,247
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what it is, but what just popped into my head is having the model taken and then for a new Rayman game, Raymanizing yourself.

897
00:55:29,622 --> 00:55:30,343
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be fun.

898
00:55:30,363 --> 00:55:32,006
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be weird.

899
00:55:32,207 --> 00:55:33,709
[SPEAKER_05]: I love manipulation like that.

900
00:55:35,092 --> 00:55:36,174
[SPEAKER_04]: We know you like manipulating.

901
00:55:37,175 --> 00:55:37,436
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob.

902
00:55:37,837 --> 00:55:38,117
[SPEAKER_02]: Here.

903
00:55:38,498 --> 00:55:38,718
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

904
00:55:40,161 --> 00:55:40,682
[SPEAKER_02]: Just messing.

905
00:55:42,216 --> 00:55:46,959
[SPEAKER_04]: You know there was this big fan homebrew thing going on, King's Quest, brought up King's Quest earlier in the show.

906
00:55:47,259 --> 00:55:50,421
[SPEAKER_04]: King's Quest 9, every cloak has a silver lining.

907
00:55:50,481 --> 00:56:10,972
[SPEAKER_04]: Get this, they had all these volunteer people, like they had a 2,000 page script going for it, 9 chapters, 450 characters, original music, original voice acting being done for this whole thing, and a cease and desist was just laid on them this week by Vivendi Universal Games, which, you know, acquired Sierra some time ago, which Sierra made the King's Quest games.

908
00:56:11,536 --> 00:56:19,258
[SPEAKER_04]: So this Mac got put down on this, which is too bad because King's Quest is kind of one of those games where I kind of, I'm always like, I wonder whatever happened to King's Quest.

909
00:56:19,278 --> 00:56:25,179
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I knew that there was like that eighth game that didn't really register on the radar too much, but then King's Quest kind of disappeared.

910
00:56:25,259 --> 00:56:28,680
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would have been excited to see something like this, a continuation of the story.

911
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:34,641
[SPEAKER_04]: And what a fan community, honestly, what a community to be getting that many people involved in a project like that.

912
00:56:34,681 --> 00:56:35,241
[SPEAKER_04]: That's great.

913
00:56:35,341 --> 00:56:37,682
[SPEAKER_04]: But unfortunately, I guess when you get that many people involved,

914
00:56:38,066 --> 00:56:41,607
[SPEAKER_04]: you start to draw attention to yourself so that's too bad I guess but

915
00:56:41,929 --> 00:56:45,411
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe they'll release it as like Queen's Trip.

916
00:56:46,472 --> 00:56:47,352
[SPEAKER_04]: There's an idea.

917
00:56:48,373 --> 00:56:50,194
[SPEAKER_04]: Queen's Journey Part 9.

918
00:56:51,154 --> 00:56:52,415
[SPEAKER_04]: Peasant's Quest.

919
00:56:52,715 --> 00:56:54,836
[SPEAKER_05]: Curse you, Trogdor!

920
00:56:55,737 --> 00:57:03,821
[SPEAKER_04]: Or, you know, maybe they could work out a deal where maybe Vivendi Universal could just distribute this game and, you know, make some money.

921
00:57:03,862 --> 00:57:07,083
[SPEAKER_04]: Download it free off of their website.

922
00:57:07,123 --> 00:57:08,424
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously, I mean, come on.

923
00:57:08,484 --> 00:57:09,785
[SPEAKER_04]: Some people still love King's Quest.

924
00:57:10,205 --> 00:57:11,326
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, last story, you guys.

925
00:57:11,346 --> 00:57:11,506
[SPEAKER_04]: Ready?

926
00:57:13,766 --> 00:57:17,409
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a brand new game coming out.

927
00:57:17,629 --> 00:57:19,430
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how else to say this.

928
00:57:21,031 --> 00:57:26,935
[SPEAKER_04]: Care Bears Catch a Star is now coming out for the PC and Macintosh.

929
00:57:27,575 --> 00:57:34,260
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, this is coming out right before the Care Bears Big Wish movie, which is coming out on DVD October 8th.

930
00:57:35,101 --> 00:57:36,782
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, that actually would have already come out here.

931
00:57:36,802 --> 00:57:37,322
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

932
00:57:38,939 --> 00:57:41,680
[SPEAKER_04]: That is the Care Bears of the 80s.

933
00:57:41,980 --> 00:57:42,680
[SPEAKER_04]: Brand new game.

934
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:45,902
[SPEAKER_05]: At least they haven't changed how they look like they did with Strawberry Shortcake.

935
00:57:45,982 --> 00:57:49,143
[SPEAKER_03]: My big wish is that they would just stay in the 80s.

936
00:57:49,363 --> 00:57:52,244
[SPEAKER_05]: You need the Care Bears stare, don't you?

937
00:57:52,304 --> 00:57:54,025
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki just needs a Care Bears stare.

938
00:57:54,285 --> 00:57:55,345
[SPEAKER_04]: I just don't care.

939
00:57:56,886 --> 00:57:57,206
[SPEAKER_04]: At all.

940
00:57:57,346 --> 00:58:00,567
[SPEAKER_05]: I still remember the Care Bears in Wonderland movie and that was awesome.

941
00:58:01,327 --> 00:58:02,328
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, it's only 20 bucks.

942
00:58:03,468 --> 00:58:04,489
[SPEAKER_04]: Can't argue with that.

943
00:58:06,369 --> 00:58:07,170
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the end of the show.

944
00:58:07,270 --> 00:58:08,270
[SPEAKER_04]: Final thoughts, Loki.

945
00:58:09,130 --> 00:58:09,951
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate the Care Bears.

946
00:58:10,611 --> 00:58:11,992
[SPEAKER_04]: Final thoughts, DarkSakura?

947
00:58:12,833 --> 00:58:16,416
[SPEAKER_05]: Reject Posse icons and itchy, tasty.

948
00:58:17,657 --> 00:58:20,799
[SPEAKER_01]: My final thought is, somebody's got a case of the Mondays.

949
00:58:23,501 --> 00:58:24,762
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, thank you guys so much.

950
00:58:24,782 --> 00:58:27,744
[SPEAKER_05]: If they really take my stapler, I'm going to set the building on fire.

951
00:58:28,185 --> 00:58:30,587

[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, it's really Columbus Day.

960
00:58:46,234 --> 00:58:46,634
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

961
00:58:47,054 --> 00:58:49,096
