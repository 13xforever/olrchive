8
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:42,140
It means a lot to us, so not just me here on this program, Rob Roberts, but also I'm

9
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:45,060
joined by the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

10
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:46,060
Not going anywhere.

11
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:49,140
That's right, he's still here, and the one and only Loki.

12
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:50,140
That's right, I'm here.

13
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:51,140
All right.

14
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:52,140
First off, I want to...

15
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,140
We're still working on that.

16
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:54,820
We were trying to vote him out.

17
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:57,780
We had an alliance going on, so we could get one step closer to the million.

18
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:00,780
I lied about my grandma dying, and then that's how I stayed in.

19
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,740
Anyway, that's a different podcast, people.

20
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:08,740
All right, anyway, starting off tonight, I want to talk about OLRPSP.com, the brand new

21
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:12,900
PSP website that we launched recently.

22
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,900
Been getting a lot of great feedback.

23
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:18,460
A couple of really big PSP sites ran stories on it, and that's just awesome, so thanks

24
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:22,940
you guys, the PSP community, for responding so well, and those of you guys that are downloading

25
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:27,940
the show on to your PSP, enjoy. Great use for your PSP, all this stuff, so.

26
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:29,940
Still working on more stuff for it too.

27
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:31,940
Yeah, Loki's still working on that website, so.

28
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:35,940
Yeah, we're looking at maybe a shell box and looking at chat, possibly.

29
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:43,940
Alright, we'll see. So check out OLRPSP.com and celebrate OLRPSP.com. How about a giveaway?

30
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:44,940
Sounds good to me!

31
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:49,940
Alright, we're going to do a giveaway. We're going to give away copies of Death Jr. and Coded Arms,

32
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:53,220
are the two games that we're giving away.

33
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,980
We're gonna give away Death Junior to one winner

34
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:56,260
and Coded Arms to another winner.

35
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:58,680
So two separate prizes here, two separate winners.

36
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,700
All you gotta do, email freestuff at orangelountrader.com.

41
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:12,760
It's just that easy.

42
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:16,580

44
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:22,780
but if you put a funny message in there that uses bad grammar, I will laugh at you.

45
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:27,780
Alright. Let's start off tonight's show talking about how our gaming week was going.

46
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,780
DarkSakura, how's your gaming week been?

47
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:35,780
Busy. Actually, I had the week off of school, so I basically sat around and did, you know, crap all day.

48
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:40,780
Well, of course I had work, but I played some Nintendogs, although I do not know where my DS is now.

49
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:42,780
Oops. I think I locked my DS in the drawer at work.

50
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,780
Did the dog eat it?

51
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:45,780
What dog? I have a cat.

52
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:46,780
I'm just teasing.

53
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:20,220
We heart kind of already though as it's cracked out. It still makes me emotion sick. All right

54
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,100
um

55
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:29,180
What else about god's playing lots of stuff dan's been playing the hell out of uh need for speed underground 2 on xbox

56
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:32,620
Lots of racing i'm so sick of hearing

57
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:38,220
When I get home, but he did make me an evo so I forgive him

58
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,340
Very cool because he said that car was dedicated to me

59
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:45,860
He's dedicating a virtual car we can never afford, well actually technically we can't

60
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,260
afford one right now.

61
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:50,380
However, in the real world.

62
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:52,780
Like an Xbox 360 and a Playstation 3 and a Revolution.

63
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:57,060
Xbox 360 does not come first on that list.

64
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:59,060
Release date-wise, yes.

65
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:01,860
Opinion-wise, no.

66
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:04,060
Anything else you've been gaming with this week?

67
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:10,860
God yeah, playing lots of Taiko no Tatsujin, Taiko Drum Master, I have the US one.

68
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:15,300
roommate extra fur yes we have our Firefly Monday a Firefly fight Friday

69
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:20,380
right and afterwards we went out we know we kidnapped my husband and all went out

70
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:25,940
to Lions and came back which is a restaurant yeah yeah late night Lions on

71
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:31,380
Firefly Friday and played lots of Taiko no Tatsujin and my hands are all bruised

72
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:34,260
and we're watching the cracked out opening sleep deprived thing you're so

73
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:37,340
cute how does the Japanese version compare to the English version and when

74
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:40,140
was the last time Jamie played Japanese version oh you haven't played it I

75
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:42,000
I thought, yeah, I've played both.

76
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,440
I haven't in my time.

77
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,840
The English one is a little bit scaled down compared to the Japanese ones.

78
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,320
It's a lot scaled down.

79
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,320
But it's still cute.

80
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,760
It's cute, but I'm gonna go on and import the others.

81
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,920
I didn't honestly have much interest in it beforehand.

82
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:58,440
But now that, I mean, I played it before, but I just was like, eh.

83
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:02,360
The Arcade one is a heck of a lot of fun, because the Taiko drum is like, Taiko, it's

84
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,360
actual size.

85
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,480
It's a heck of a lot of fun.

86
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,060
I like playing the Arcade version.

87
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:10,660
Of course, I only know of one arcade, and that's in LA, which is not exactly around

88
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:11,660
the corner from us.

89
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:13,940
They need to bring out the PSP version here.

90
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,820
It's a lot of fun.

91
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:19,060
It's not the same when you've got a game like that on the PSP.

92
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:23,420
It's not the same when you've got a game like that on the PSP because there's no taiko drum.

93
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:24,420
It still works.

94
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:25,420
Yawn, whoring, whatever.

95
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:30,200
I'll say Dan's been playing Castlevania Dawn of Sorrow.

96
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,660
I'm definitely going to touch on that later because I picked that up too.

97
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:33,660
It's looking pretty nice.

98
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,660
Did you get a chance to play it yourself yet?

99
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:37,660
I turned it on in the bathroom.

100
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:39,660
He left the DS in there.

101
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:40,660
All right.

102
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:43,660
I trip over the thing because he has a half-hanging...

103
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:46,660
We have this hanging basket in our bathroom, and he had it sticking out,

104
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:48,660
and I ran into it and knocked it across the floor.

105
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:51,660
I was like, oh shit, did I break it down the DS?

106
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,660
I was getting on my...

107
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:55,660
Because I keep the cat box in the bathroom too.

108
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:58,660
I was afraid I knocked it into the cat litter.

109
00:05:58,660 --> 00:05:59,660
Oops.

110
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:00,660
Wow.

111
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:01,660
All right.

112
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:05,660
I've been playing World of Warcraft 2.

113
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:06,660
How's that going?

114
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:09,660
Really, it's tons of fun.

115
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,660
Did you catch that disease that was going around in World of Warcraft?

116
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,660
That was before I started playing, thank you.

117
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:19,660
I think the disease is hilarious, because it is actually the first true

118
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:22,660
first virtually created virus.

119
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:26,660
You know, I was reading something, it didn't make the cut for tonight's stories,

120
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:30,660
but something about that some official government agency is using that to

121
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:36,320
to study disease control now that would happen in World of Warcraft. So strange to me, but

122
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,320
interesting.

123
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:41,800
But it's pretty cool, because the thing is that it was passing to any character in the

124
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,800
game.

125
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,880
Because, you know, people can teleport in real life.

126
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:54,080
But the thing is that it was passing on to any standing character in the game that anyone

127
00:06:54,080 --> 00:07:01,180
talks to, and it was passing to the NPCs, and that's how it was spreading, is that people

128
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:07,200
would contract whatever that is, heal themselves, they would contract it, teleport in, talk

129
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:11,440
to the NPC, heal themselves, the NPC gets it, passes it on, because it cuts something

130
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:17,920
like 200 and something life each time it drops, for someone who's level 50, that doesn't matter,

131
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:23,620
for someone who's just starting off, that's instant death, and it keeps happening.

132
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:29,620
So they counteracted it by having them infected with something else or it's fixed but I never

133
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:30,860
had to worry about it.

134
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:31,860
Interesting.

135
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:34,340
Lucky, what have you been playing this week?

136
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:36,020
I've been playing Burnout Revenge.

137
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:39,140
Did you play anything besides Burnout?

138
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:42,060
I played Burnout Legends.

139
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:45,380
You're becoming a broken record.

140
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:50,220
Sorry, you know, I played this during the week and I don't have time to play stuff during

141
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,220
a home.

142
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:55,820
I really wish I did, but I played Nintendogs.

143
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:56,820
Taco's still alive.

144
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:59,020
I'm kind of done with Nintendogs now.

145
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,020
Me too.

146
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,020
I'm done.

147
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,020
I don't really care about Taco anymore.

148
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:04,500
I guess the virtual pet thing wasn't for me.

149
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:08,060
It's just I lost the attention to it, because you can't really do that much.

150
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:10,540
It's still a great game, but it's just, I don't know.

151
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:13,820
It's fun to throw bones and stuff at their head, but it's just, you know.

152
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:14,820
The Bark Ball.

153
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:15,820
It's all about the Bark Ball.

154
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:18,460
Maybe if there's expansions later on that your dog can learn to do more things.

155
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:20,460
When you quit playing, give me all your stuff.

156
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:24,500
Alright, we'll see, we'll see. Because I have a Mario hat, it's pretty cool.

157
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,420
I'm just waiting for Animal Crossing though.

158
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:32,020
I'm so looking forward to the Wi-Fi, it's going to be awesome. It's going to be cool,

159
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:35,580
except, I mean, how's that going to work with people coming into your town? I mean, we could have

160
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:36,500
like people like

161
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:40,180
destroying towns. I'm sure they have tested this thing into the ground, they'll

162
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:44,340
have a way to do it. Folks can interact with us in our town. You probably can only

163
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:48,100
allow certain, you probably get to allow who comes into your town and which trains

164
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:48,940
can run into your town.

165
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:52,300
it's going to be interesting. I feel like bark mode. Maybe.

166
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:56,060
I think it's going to be like bark mode. You have to be in like town mode or something.

167
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:57,860
But Wi-Fi somehow.

168
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:02,340
It's on the internet. It'd be interesting. Obviously you can't run when your DS is off, so you'd be able to monitor

169
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:03,900
who's coming in and out of your town, so

170
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:08,140
it'll be interesting. No retro game stuff pisses me off. I know.

171
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:12,260
Bad Nintendo. Bad. I got to play against the

172
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:16,940
Mario voice. At E3? At E3. Oh yeah. The whole reason I... And you said I was lovely.

173
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:22,400
The whole reason I bought Animal Crossing was because it had all those old Nintendo

174
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:26,920
games hidden in it, and come to find out Animal Crossing was actually a really freaking great

175
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:31,940
game in itself, and so I'm looking forward to the sequel, or I guess what I originally

176
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:34,400
thought was just going to be another port of the game, but now it's looking more like

177
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,400
a sequel, so...

178
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,720
I loved my house, with my big bonfire in the middle of my house.

179
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,360
Oh yeah, I loved your shrine to fire that you had in your house, it was awesome.

180
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,120
And I had taiko drums in my house.

181
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,800
Animal Crossing was such a great game, I would still be playing it if there was just a little

182
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,800
more to do.

183
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:53,600
I hope they bring out a really expansive version of it later on.

184
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:58,240
For any of those companies out there, I'm willing to advertise in my town for your products.

185
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,240
Shut up.

186
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:10,560
I actually, I have a Dobutsu no Mori, Japanese Animal Forest, which I actually bought to

187
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:15,900
to help myself with my Japanese because it's all in hiragana katakana.

188
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:19,200
The kanji that's in there is like first grade level kanji.

189
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:24,640
It's nothing hard and the thing is I don't know if anyone's ever listened to when they

190
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,360
speak in the U.S. when they're actually saying every letter in the words that they're speaking.

191
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,160
Well, in the Japanese one, now they do say it very fast.

192
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:34,280
It's hard to catch it, but they're saying every syllable.

193
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:38,320
They're actually speaking Japanese when they talk to you.

194
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,320
is very fast.

195
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,320
It's just very fast.

196
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,320
And cartoony style.

197
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,320
Exactly.

198
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,920
However, if you listen carefully enough, you can actually hear them talking.

199
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:46,920
Slow it down.

200
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:47,920
Record it.

201
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:48,920
Slow it down.

202
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:49,920
Mm-hmm.

203
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,920
All right.

204
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:51,920
Anything else you've been playing this week, Logie?

205
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:52,920
Nope.

206
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:53,920
All right.

207
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,920
My week.

208
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:55,920
A few games I want to talk about.

209
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,920
I want to follow up on Lost in Blue.

210
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,900
It was something that I kind of touched on last week, but I didn't really get to give

211
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:03,720
a more in-depth impression of it because I feel like I didn't get to play enough of

212
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,720
it.

213
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,720
So I played a little more Lost in Blue.

214
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:08,360
Sorry to say it didn't really hold my interest.

215
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:11,880
I would have to say borderline not recommend Lost in Blue.

216
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:15,200
I think there is an audience for this game out there.

217
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,760
It really reminds me of an old school like computer point and click game like an old

218
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:26,880
school King's Quest Loom style game and there's definitely some creative things to be done

219
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:31,320
with the stylus like digging in the sand and starting the fire and some of the things you

220
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:39,040
do, but I was just really bored with the story, and it seemed like I got so close to dying,

221
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,040
what?

222
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:44,120
I didn't get that far to the milk and the goat part, no.

223
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:48,960
I heard it was almost impossible to milk the goat.

224
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:52,800
The game, honestly, I didn't really want to play it that much longer, it just really didn't

225
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:57,720
hold my interest, so I can't really recommend Lost in Blue, but I do think there are people

226
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:01,960
out there that would like this type of game, so I'm not going to completely say avoid it,

227
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:06,120
but I'm just going to say borderline non-recommend, because I think there are people out there

228
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:09,040
that might enjoy it. If you like those old-style computer point-and-click games, you actually

229
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:13,240
might get a kick out of this. You might like this more than I did. And I did like some

230
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:16,560
King's Quest games and some of that stuff, I just wasn't, like, really into it, so that's

231
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,560
why I came.

232
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,720
Yeah, King's Quest bored the tears out of me, but I love Loom.

233
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:23,140
See, I love King's Quest IV, like that is an awesome game and some of the other King's

234
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:26,000
Quest. In fact, I have a King's Quest related story for later, but we'll talk about that

235
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
in a minute.

236
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,200
The other game I played, based on a recommendation in the forums, I didn't even know this game

237
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:42,200
was out, but Tecmo Arcade Collection, it's a bunch of old Tecmo arcade games packaged

238
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:46,440
on one, I think it's only for Xbox, Xbox DVD.

239
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:50,640
What is great about this is that it supports widescreen televisions, so if you want to

240
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:54,240
play Tecmobile, it actually shows in widescreen on your TV.

241
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,800
I think that's pretty awesome.

242
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,800
Of course, you know, you could play it on a normal TV as well, it's just going to be

243
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,360
a little bit smaller of an image, but Tecmo Bowl in the arcade was much different than

244
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:06,360
it was on the NES, and I have to say I'm actually a little bit disappointed, it wasn't quite

245
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,360
what I remember.

246
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,640
Like, on the NES it was really cool, but in the arcade it seemed kind of slow and jerky

247
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:13,800
and just not my kind of game.

248
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:17,120
And that's kind of how I felt playing a lot of these games in the Tecmo collection, was

249
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,720
like, boy, I just, I remember this game being a lot better.

250
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:28,340
And granted, you go into a game like Rygar, now Rygar on the NES was completely different

251
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:29,340
than it was in the arcade.

252
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:36,380
The arcade was like a side-scroller action-based game where the Nintendo one was borderline

253
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:37,380
role-playing style.

254
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:42,420
It was more of a quest and walk-around, more free-roaming type of game.

255
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:46,480
The arcade one, that's probably one of my more favorite games in the collection, but

256
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,100
still it's kind of like one of those things where I was like, boy, I remember this game

257
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:54,960
being better when I played it in the 80s and then I do like Solomon's Key and

258
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:59,300
Pinball Action and some of the titles that they aren't so much hyping in this

259
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:03,060
they're really like gems hidden in this collection that are very cool like I

260
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:06,420
like Solomon's Key the arcade version is very cool and some of the other stuff in

261
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:11,100
there as well here's my biggest problem with with the Tecmo collection it's

262
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:17,220
$29.99 not $19.99 and I honestly think $29.99 is a little high when you consider

263
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:21,300
that most of the retro, at least where I paid for it, it was $29.99, and there were other

264
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:27,160
retro collections sitting right next to it, the Midway one, the Namco one, for $19.99.

265
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:32,460
And I just, I don't think the price additional is really justified with this, so what if

266
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:33,460
it has Tecmo Bowl?

267
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:37,340
I think $19.99 is a more fair price to be charging for this game.

268
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:42,720
So I'm gonna borderline recommend it just because I think there's some good titles in

269
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,940
here that a lot of folks might remember from the NES but they never got to play the arcade

270
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:50,000
versions of some of these games, and I think it's worth checking out. There are a lot of

271
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:56,360
really good gems in this series, but it's nothing to drop everything and go right out

272
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,000
and buy.

273
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,720
Next game I played this week was Sprung for the Nintendo DS, which is actually a game

274
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,760
that has been out for quite some time.

275
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,760
Since launch.

276
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:08,000
It was one of the launch titles. I finally got around to playing it this week. Sprung

277
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:15,780
is one of the second worst video game I've ever played on the DS. It is an awful game.

278
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:18,300
I didn't even find a game inside Sprung.

279
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:21,420
I understand Sprung is supposed to be like a dating sim.

280
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:26,860
So basically all you do is you watch this absolutely idiotic story and select the best

281
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:31,060
answer from a list and once in a while you use an item.

282
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:34,740
I was so bored with this game, I forced myself to play the game a little bit longer, but

283
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:37,560
I was just like, this is stupid.

284
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:40,120
Why is this a game on the DS?

285
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:43,420
This should be a game that's a flash thing on somebody's website.

286
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:45,780
I can't believe somebody will waste their money on Sprung.

287
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:49,620
I definitely do not recommend Avoid Like the Plague Sprung.

288
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:50,620
It's awful.

289
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:53,020
It's not even a game.

290
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:57,300
It's a scenario-based borefest.

291
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:00,340
Keep in mind that those games are very, very popular in Japan.

292
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:02,820
Yeah, but they're also better in Japan.

293
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:04,720
He has Tokimeki Memorial.

294
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,600
You get to see boobs in the Japanese one.

295
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,300
You don't even get that here.

296
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:12,220
So they did a Tokimeki for girls.

297
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:15,580
Well, yeah, and in this one you can play as the girl or the guy

298
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:20,700
But it doesn't matter that both stories suck so there's the girl one

299
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:24,740
I mean, she actually has to convince the guy to have sex with her cuz I

300
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:30,860
Honestly, so I don't know if they ever got it on. I just didn't care. I I wanted that game out of my DS

301
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:35,420
It's that bad and for the record on the only game I've played that's worse than that is ping-pals

302
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:39,300
chat room sim

303
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:43,060
yeah would be picked a chat for an additional that's like picked a chat

304
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:46,140
plus crappy minigames what is that come on

305
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:49,540
I anyway I last game Castlevania Dawn of Sorrow

306
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:53,780
finally a really really good game I played this week if you like to the most

307
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:56,020
recent Castlevania game that they put out on the

308
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:59,980
the Game Boy Advance we're like collecting the souls and absorbing the

309
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:00,640
souls

310
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:03,880
you're gonna like this one because like the exact same freaking thing it's a

311
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,280
a continuation in that story.

312
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:09,520
And it's an absolute continuation of the story, except they added the magic seal thing, which

313
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:13,960
is kind of hokey, but they did some other touch screen elements, like certain souls

314
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:17,740
that you absorb, you use the touch screen as part of it, and that's kind of neat.

315
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:18,740
And you can play as Alucard.

316
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,360
Ooh, I didn't get that far yet.

317
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:25,480
I believe, because Dan showed me something on one of the sites, I believe that Alucard

318
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,200
is an unlockable character in that game.

319
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,200
Oh, that's cool.

320
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,200
Oh, I hope so.

321
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,920
Then you meet with the other people and you can switch off like in Castlevania III.

322
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:36,480
I say I haven't gotten that far in the game yet, but I do know I like this game, Symphony

323
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:41,720
of the Night, one of the greatest video games ever in my opinion, and although I haven't

324
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:47,000
followed the advanced game so well, I did like this most recent one they had, the Aria

325
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:52,480
of Sorrow, but I like this, the continuation, it's great, and there's extra features like

326
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,320
a versus and a soul trading thing, it's great.

327
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,280
For Castlevania fans, especially if you're a fan of Symphony of the Night, this one doesn't

328
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:07,600
disappoint. My only complaints is that the drawing thing is a little bit hokey. That's

329
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,200
about it, honestly. It's a great game. I recommend Castlevania Dawn of Sorrow.

330
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:16,080
I still love the opinion they need to do a US release of what was the Saturn version

331
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,320
of Symphony of the Night in Japan. Oh, where you could play as Maria, right?

332
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:24,660
Yeah. That game, the one problem I had with it is that the 3D effects were not as good.

333
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:30,300
the 2D effects were much better, the sound was infinitely better because as the sound

334
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:37,380
processor and 2D graphics in the Saturn were far superior to the Playstation, but it had

335
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:40,500
so much more to offer that I think that that game would sell very well if it comes out

336
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,500
over here.

337
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:52,300
You know a complaint I heard about Castlevania Dawn of Sorrow, a complaint I heard was you

338
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,580
don't get to use a whip.

339
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:56,580
Yeah, it's not a Castlevania game if you don't use a whip.

340
00:18:56,580 --> 00:19:01,580
It is a totally a Castlevania game. I don't get that argument.

341
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:05,580
You do unlock a character who is one of the Belmonts and you do get to use a whip.

342
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:10,580
So what? You don't get to use a whip. The swords play practically the exact same way. I don't get that.

343
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:13,580
Wait a second. You need to use a whip in Symphony of the Night.

344
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:14,580
I know.

345
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:15,580
Yes you do.

346
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,580
Victor is an unlockable character.

347
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:19,580
Well still though, that's the same thing though.

348
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:21,580
It's the Victor story.

349
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:24,580
The night is the greatest Castlevania game, period.

350
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,580
Ever.

351
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:28,580
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

352
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:31,580
Not even Simon's Quest, not even Castlevania 3, not even the original.

353
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:33,580
Dracula X was infinitely better.

354
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:36,580
No, I, I, you show me Dracula X, I still think...

355
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:41,580
Dracula X was the last true Castlevania game.

356
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,580
Possibly. I could see that argument.

357
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:44,580
The series...

358
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:47,580
But not the Super Nintendo version, not the Super Nintendo version.

359
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:57,340
Even that was good, but when you started getting into the whole Metroid-style gameplay, I don't

360
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:59,340
think there's a comparison.

361
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:04,300
Anyway, we've got to get into some other actual news going on this week.

362
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:10,020
As much as I could argue about Castlevania all night long, let's talk about it.

363
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:11,020
And hi, you're a nerd.

364
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:12,020
You're listening to it.

365
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:13,020
Just kidding.

366
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:16,420
We love our listeners.

367
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:19,900
Follow-ups to some stories we've talked about previously, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger

368
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:24,220
here in California where we record our show, he did sign that bill and that's the one that

369
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:28,780
will ban the sale of violent video games to minors and you could be fined up to a thousand

370
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:34,100
dollars if you're a retailer violating the law, and this takes effect January 1st.

371
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:37,740
So kids, you better put those violent video games on your Christmas list, because starting

372
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:43,900
January 1 you won't be able to buy them yourself, or your retailer might get a fine.

373
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:47,060
Thank God I did not vote for him.

374
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:49,300
Without getting too political here though, I mean...

375
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,300
I'm just saying.

376
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,300
I know, but...

377
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,300
It's a govenator.

378
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:58,100
I don't know I mean honestly I could say I didn't vote for him either but this

379
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:02,420
really was written by a Democratic assemblyman it's really a bipartisan

380
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:07,140
thing I just think there's I don't think everything was truly being considered

381
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:10,460
with this I just I just think there could have been a better option to do

382
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:14,320
what they wanted to do I I'm cool with them I don't know how much I want to

383
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:18,460
rehash the same topic though honestly just go listen to an old podcast I know

384
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:24,620
I've talked about it before I just have a quick description for getting more

385
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:30,780
voters but that could be said of either either party in this case because the

386
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:35,740
media kind of taking the popular opinion and using media hype to gain himself

387
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:43,740
some more voters who knows alright GameStop and EB Games the merger was

388
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:48,420
approved we talked previously that you know GameStop was gonna buy EB Games it

389
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:53,260
It was approved, the merger went through, and I don't know if the names are changing

390
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:54,260
though.

391
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,260
I don't think they are.

392
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:56,260
But they are officially one company.

393
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:59,700
They'll be just game games.

394
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:01,140
Now on to some other stories.

395
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:13,340
The Gizmondo is on its way out on October 22, and there's something special though about

396
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:14,340
the Gizmondo.

397
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:15,340
Right, Jamie?

398
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:16,340
They kind of changed something.

399
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:18,340
Well, yeah, it's going to be widescreen.

400
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:20,500
We have a widescreen Gizmondo.

401
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,500
So why are they doing that?

402
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,500
It looks like the PSP.

403
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,380
I think it's funny.

404
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:33,300
I like the phrase, though, that the rumors that Gizmondo is $210 million in the hole

405
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:35,500
isn't going to stop the release on time.

406
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,660
I'm sure the Phantom console is worse in the hole.

407
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:38,660
Yeah.

408
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:41,780
The only reason it's widescreen is they're trying to compete with the pop station.

409
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:42,780
Sure.

410
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:52,200
But taking a look at the image of the widescreen gizmondo, I have to say, I liked the gizmondo.

411
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,640
I had absolutely no problem with it.

412
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,200
This thing does look pretty sleek.

413
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,760
Yeah, but does it have sight talking?

414
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:02,400
Oh, they definitely changed the look of that from what they were showing at E3.

415
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:09,720
You know what's funny is I remember the original shots of the PSP back when it was conceptual

416
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,720
still.

417
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,240
They had shots of fish as well.

418
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,800
I think that's kind of ironic in that picture of the widescreen gizmondo, there's fish on

419
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:16,800
it.

420
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,420
Maybe they took that as a favorable sign.

421
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:20,440
Are you going to be picking one of these up, Dark Star Crown?

422
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,440
I hope so.

423
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:28,000
I mean, ever since I got to play it at E3 and played that game, Johnny Whatever, that

424
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,540
had the karaoke mode, was sort of like Guitar Freaks.

425
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:31,540
What other games are on this thing?

426
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:33,760
That's the only one I really know anything about, is the Johnny Whatever.

427
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,760
I have no idea.

428
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:35,760
See?

429
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,760
And what's the golden rule of gaming?

430
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,400
We brought this up on the three hour show this week.

431
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,320
A system is only as good as the games that are on it.

432
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:44,320
So I want to hear less about the Gizmondo and more about the games.

433
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:48,060
So start putting out the game information in your press releases, because I'm really

434
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,060
curious.

435
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:50,060
However, it's Tiger.

436
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,060
Tiger Toys.

437
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:52,060
Oh yeah, but you know.

438
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:55,480
They bought us hours of black and white entertainment back in the day.

439
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,480
Very true.

440
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00,280
You get those Tiger Toys and you're about to crack a jacks.

441
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,280
Yep.

442
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,280
Very true.

443
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,600
Um, Loki, what's kind of going on in the hack and crack scene?

444
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:08,360
I know there was, of course, the mandatory PSP update that happened.

445
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,360
Yes, 2.01.

446
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:13,600
It adds no features whatsoever other than fixing the hole that allows you to do stuff

447
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,000
with your PSP.

448
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:22,080
Other than that, since people love the hack of the firmware, they're doing some more cosmetic

449
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,080
modifications.

450
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:28,200
The first one is they have a guide to removing the broken icons.

451
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:33,920
It requires you to hex edit your firmware and the run of programming basically just

452
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:38,280
blanks out those icons instead of actually having them pop up.

453
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:41,840
The other one is, you know those little wavy lines that are on there that prevent burn

454
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:42,840
in?

455
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,880
You can get rid of those too as well.

456
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,160
Just more cosmetic stuff.

457
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,400
I like the wavy lines.

458
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:50,960
I know, but some people don't and you know what?

459
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:55,920
They just want to remove them, so by golly, they're going to do it.

460
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:56,920
So yeah.

461
00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:01,000
We were talking earlier in the show a little bit about Nintendogs and I was saying that

462
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,560
I get a little burned out on Nintendogs, but the fun is just beginning for some of our

463
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,440
other friends, right Jamie?

464
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,440
Yep.

465
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:14,960
The seventh nintendo dogs was just released in europe and uh...

466
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,480
loki didn't you post some photos from that in your blog?

467
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:23,160
it was freaking cute is what it was yes they had um some pictures of the people bringing

468
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:29,720
their dogs with them um it was just absolutely adorable um they've got one where the dogs

469
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:37,320
like actually sniffing the, the, or licking the, um, oh my god, dog licking the D.S. Eh?

470
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:42,040
Eh? He's trying to be a celebrity. DarkSakura, any word on how this game is selling? Over

471
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:45,560
in Europe? Um, taking a look, oh, there's just your cute picture of the puppy and his

472
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:53,600
darker ball. I'm sorry, I love that game so much. Um, it got an 8 out of 10 by Eurogamer.

473
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:59,000
Mm-hmm. Um, really most of the problems, the same problems I had with it was, uh, getting

474
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:04,820
them to actually understanding what you're saying, but I haven't seen much as far as

475
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:05,820
the sales on it go.

476
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:08,880
I haven't yet pulled up the numbers, I've just been pulling up the reviews.

477
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:15,360
There was a fun line I like in this one review I read on Eurogamer, just to read the small

478
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,360
paragraph.

479
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,360
Sure.

480
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,380
It says, while we're enchanted by it, since it's a highly engaging and entertaining game

481
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:24,560
and one that makes excellent use of the DS's unique capabilities, plus it's got puppies

482
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,560
in it.

483
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,440
I think that sums it up.

484
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:33,920
By the way, they did throw a puppy party to celebrate the launch of this game, which featured

485
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:42,760
such wonderful events as dog-loving celebrities, they had actual canine celebrities as well,

486
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:45,400
some dogs from different shows and stuff.

487
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:52,940
They had dog's eye video screens, a very important pooch chill-out area, and the Doggie Olympics

488
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:58,820
as well as a doggie disco.

489
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:02,460
Because Nintendogs is so big, there are other people out there that want to steal some of

490
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:03,460
Nintendogs thunder, correct?

491
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:04,460
Yeah, there are.

492
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:14,040
I'm also trying to find the numbers, by the way, but yeah, O3 has decided to put out one

493
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:22,580
for the GBA called Pocket Dogs, which is basically the same thing on the GBA.

494
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:26,820
So how would you do that on the GBA with no voice and no touch screens, you can't really

495
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:27,820
text your dog?

496
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:31,360
It's actually from the Hanadekka Club toy brand.

497
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,020
Is there screenshots up there on your screen there?

498
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:40,040
Yeah, Hanadekka Club is sort of like the dog with the fisheye camera, so it's all the puppies

499
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,040
done the same way.

500
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:46,560
There are eight breeds to choose from, including Pugs, Chihuahua, Shih Tzu.

501
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:50,200
The dogs can talk with their owners, find out about their likes and dislikes, and will

502
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:53,620
play games of fetch, frisbee, balls, and bones.

503
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:57,500
I'm sure that it's crap compared to the other one.

504
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:01,220
I don't know because I do like the Hanadeka stuff.

505
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:14,300
I'd look at it, but this actually is, so far it looks like it will be released this holiday

506
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:15,300
season.

507
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:16,300
Alright.

508
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:20,060
Moving on, there's some other stuff coming out for the DS.

509
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:25,760
I thought this was very interesting, Square Enix is actually putting out a game called

510
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:30,760
Mario Basket 3 vs. 3, so shock at something that's not a role-playing game, although it's

511
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:33,640
not the first time they haven't done a role-playing game, but very interesting, they're kind of

512
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:39,100
doing this little basketball-looking game, and it's a 3-on-3 game using the DS, it should

513
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:43,340
be interesting, it has a very Mario Kart-style look to it, which I think is very interesting

514
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:46,580
considering it's being developed not by Nintendo, but by Square.

515
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:49,140
We did get Mario Baseball.

516
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:50,140
That's true.

517
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:51,140
That's true.

518
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:52,140
That just recently came out.

519
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:56,380
Also, Nintendo is unveiling a new Wario Land game that's coming out very soon and that

520
00:28:56,380 --> 00:29:00,300
will also be on the DS, so it should be interesting.

521
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:01,980
I want to mention this for PSP.

522
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:09,380
Our friends on the PSP, Datel has released a four gigabyte hard drive for the PSP.

523
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:14,140
Now because this is a hard drive, it also has a battery that goes with it and it's supposed

524
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:18,580
to boost your time that you play or like it's supposed to like boost the loading times as

525
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:19,580
as well, using the hard drive.

526
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:24,700
Well, it's twice the battery power for one, because it's basically this giant battery

527
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,420
that sticks out of your battery port there.

528
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:27,420
Right.

529
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:29,740
Then it's also got a 4GB drive in there as well.

530
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:36,880
Now the only bad thing about Datel is they've got really bad track record with their batteries.

531
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,580
Their batteries tend to explode.

532
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:39,820
Oh my gosh!

533
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:46,380
So hopefully this won't have the explosive feature in it, but hey, more storage space

534
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:48,980
Price is always good, just expensive.

535
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:53,340
And speaking of which, no price released yet for this.

536
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:55,580
Actually there is a price released for that.

537
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:56,580
Oh, I hadn't read it.

538
00:29:56,580 --> 00:30:03,260
The price is going to be actually, I believe it was roughly, they had the European price

539
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:08,920
for it, which was I think the range of, I can't remember how many pounds, but it ended

540
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,580
up being about $250 US.

541
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:13,340
Wow, that's almost as much as the PSP.

542
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:19,020
Yeah, well, it's ridiculous, actually, but if you want to store tons of crap...

543
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:23,940
Especially since you can't buy actual 4GB hard drives anyway anymore, and if you could,

544
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:25,940
they'd be like $15.

545
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:33,500
Well, they're releasing that one peripheral that the team executor is working on that's

546
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:40,780
actually going to be using CompactFlash and micro drives, which go up to 6GB, and those

547
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:45,680
Those are a little bit less expensive, but actually, if you get that on there, and then

548
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:51,420
you add the, there's an adapter you can make or buy that converts laptop drives to work

549
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:56,300
with Combat Flash, you can, in a sense, have, you know, a 30 gig, 120 gig drive.

550
00:30:56,300 --> 00:31:02,120
Of course, you'd be spending upwards of about $500 for it, but, you know, hey, if you want

551
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:06,080
more space, I mean, that's one way to do it.

552
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,080
And let's see.

553
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:13,400
All right, I'm looking to see here real quick because I know they had that going for it.

554
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:21,400
They also had actually the PSP TV stuff, they announced the price point for that as well.

555
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,400
Oh, what was that?

556
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,120
Do you know the price for that?

557
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:26,000
Price for that is going to be $119.

558
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,280
They're taking pre-orders right now.

559
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:31,480
One of the things that they added to it is an S-video out, so you can have that plus

560
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,480
the swappable.

561
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:36,320
You can do 4.3 or 16.9 aspect ratios.

562
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:42,200
Speaking of money, but going to a different company, is rumors going around this week,

563
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:50,400
and I think some of it comes back to Joystiq.com, ran an article about Nintendo possibly releasing

564
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:58,120
the revolution for $99, kind of a rumor that's going around right now, wouldn't that be very

565
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:04,660
interesting though, because the Xbox 360 is going to be what, $300 for the core, $400

566
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:09,140
a little more PlayStation 3 we don't know yet but we can expect it will

567
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:13,900
probably be about the same so what a way for Nintendo to catch up by being kind

568
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:18,500
of last one out the gate to really you know create interest in their system

569
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:22,100
because it would only be $100 can you imagine it would be very smart I'd have

570
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:26,820
to the only thing I can think of logically is if the system is not that

571
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:32,940
expensive to make for parts and labor mm-hmm and however much they would pay

572
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:38,700
per system for marketing and then for you know shipping sales you'd have to

573
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:44,780
see what what their overhead is in this however you can make enough product with

574
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:50,340
even a minute profit to make back and pull a good profit by selling more units

575
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:53,740
you know what's interesting is I seem to remember that Nintendo has tried to

576
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:58,180
launch new systems at $99 before and usually doesn't make it they usually get

577
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:02,580
launched for about 150 I'm thinking the GameCube here GameCube and I think

578
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:06,020
Nintendo 64 was almost the same way as well when it first came out. I can't remember

579
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:07,980
100 percent. It might have been 200, but

580
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:10,900
I know both of those they were aiming for $99, so I would expect that the

581
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:13,260
revolution is probably going to be about $150

582
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:17,420
if this is really true. Even so, it's comparable. Even so, that's half.

583
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:19,580
Very competitive. That's half as much.

584
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:22,780
That would be a real way for Nintendo to gain some ground if they were going to be the

585
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:24,220
last ones out the gate, but

586
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:28,500
you know, who knows? There's the whole innovation thing with the controller.

587
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:32,020
But on top of that, Nintendo has always been oriented toward more family,

588
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:40,980
child games, and what parent is going to want to buy their small child a $350 system, when

589
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:45,860
they can get a $150 system that would be easier to play, should their child track it?

590
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:46,860
Absolutely.

591
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:47,860
I have something to add here.

592
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:48,860
Okay.

593
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:49,860
What?

594
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,740
I don't think we've heard everything about the revolution yet.

595
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:54,220
I think there's more features they haven't even announced yet.

596
00:33:54,220 --> 00:34:00,340
For example, there was a conference a while back when they were talking about pushing

597
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:07,340
into the next stage, which is basically 3D, so you're going to have 3D movies and stuff,

598
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:09,540
like they're going to remake Star Wars and stuff.

599
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:13,860
One of the presenters there, I believe it might have been Peter Jackson or something,

600
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:19,220
someone there, Robert Rodriguez, I think it was, mentioned that a lot of film companies

601
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:26,700
are going to add one game company out there, they're referring to one of the big three,

602
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:33,700
actually going to be using this in their next console. So, I think that what's going to

603
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:38,380
be is, and this is my theory, is that they're going to have, it's not going to be as powerful

604
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:47,380
photorealistic wise, but it's going to be 3D, which will be why you need a 3D remote.

605
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:50,100
Interesting thought, we'll see.

606
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:54,200
Loki dropped the name Peter Jackson, of course Peter Jackson's got that King Kong movie coming

607
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:58,140
out pretty soon. DarkSakura, you said something about the game?

608
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:05,860
Just a little something on it. I found the trailer for it is actually up on Eurogamer.net.

609
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:11,600
If you go into their download section, there's the Peter Jackson's King Kong demo available

610
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,720
for download. I think that's probably hitting a lot of the

611
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:18,240
major game sites because I actually saw a little clip of the game in action. It looks

612
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:23,560
very nice. If you want to see what the Xbox 360 might look like by using your PC, kind

613
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,880
I know, because the graphics are supposed to be comparable.

614
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:26,880
Check it out on your PC.

615
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:30,840
There's also a teaser for Tomb Raider Legends x360.

616
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,640
And teaser would be not playable though, right?

617
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,640
Just a little trailer?

618
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:37,360
Right, but it is there to see some of the stuff.

619
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:42,000
Also one I'm kind of interested in myself is the Possession Zombie Takedown.

620
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Just because you like zombies, you like to eat brains.

621
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
I like the zombies.

622
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,280
I know, but I keep starving in this town.

623
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,600
Alright, DarkSakura.

624
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:55,780
You know, you have to help save the children of America, basically, because, you know,

625
00:35:55,780 --> 00:36:01,800
they can't be playing the video games all day long, because if they play video games

626
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:05,420
all day long, then they really will turn into zombies who go around eating brains, and they

627
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:06,420
can't do it for fun.

628
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:08,060
MTV does it for us.

629
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:13,140
So anyway, Dark Sakura's here to save America with her one and only advice column.

630
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:15,980
Dark Sakura, what are you going to tell the kids about tonight?

631
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:20,180
Today's piece of advice is how to jump from a moving train, because you never know when

632
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:24,180
are going to be having a jump from the train, or the Obama from the train.

633
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:30,180
Number one, make your jump from the end of the rear car.

634
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:35,180
Obviously, duh. You don't jump from the middle because then, sorry.

635
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:41,180
Wait for the train to slow as it rounds the bend in the tracks if you have time.

636
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:47,180
Pick your landing spot, that's number two. The ideal spot is relatively soft and free of obstruction.

637
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:51,180
3. Get as low to the floor as possible, bending your knees.

638
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:59,180
4. Jump perpendicular, that's sideways children, to the train, leaping as far as you can.

639
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:02,180
5. Cover your head with your arms and roll like a log when you land.

640
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:08,180
6. For my final, final piece of advice, if you hitchhiking, stick to cars.

641
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:11,180
Much easier. You don't have to jump from a train.

642
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:14,180
Alright, looking for that piece of advice.

643
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:21,040
Loki what's going on with the Xbox 360 and some I know you like to talk about homebrew stuff for

644
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:26,600
PSP but now it sounds like there's independent stuff going on for the 360. What's this about?

645
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:32,660
Yeah, one of the things that the 360 is gonna have is the Xbox Live Arcade where you can download mini games

646
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:35,560
Probably not free, but you can download them

647
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,940
Some of the mini games that they've been showing off actually

648
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:42,980
Actually there's been a couple and those are going to be actually at the Independent Games

649
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:45,900
Conference in Eugene, Oregon.

650
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:54,460
The first one being Marble Blast Ultra, which looks like a cheap PC ripoff of Marble Madness.

651
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:56,740
That may not be a bad thing though, Marble Madness is excellent.

652
00:37:56,740 --> 00:38:01,540
It's not a bad thing, I mean it looks okay.

653
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:05,780
One of the other things that they had this other game, Mutant Swarm, which sort of just

654
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:12,040
look like another Asteroids-type game. One I'm excited about, Geometry Wars 2, which

655
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:17,780
is actually going to be bundled with Project Gotham Racing 3, and this game looks friggin'

656
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:24,180
awesome. It's kind of a combo between Asteroids, Res, and Phantom Vision. Just tons of explosions

657
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:30,340
on the screen. The other ones that they were showing off, which actually is pretty cool,

658
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:33,220
is Joust, a classic Atari game.

659
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:34,220
Right on.

660
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:37,860
Now they have joust, but do they have burger time?

661
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:42,740
Sucks! Sucks! Worst system ever!

662
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:44,460
No, I'm kidding.

663
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:48,140
One of the things I was going to mention is the Xbox hard drive that they're

664
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:51,740
coming out with, it does come with some other features.

665
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:55,980
Yeah, I was looking about this. What's this? Like Hexic or something?

666
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:59,900
Hexin. No, Hexin's a different game.

667
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:04,060
Hexic. It's like a Tetris game. It's actually done by the guy who did Tetris.

668
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:08,500
there's going to be actually videos like the behind the scenes of the Xbox

669
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,980
whatever and then they have like custom soundtrack stuff and

670
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:14,500
more gamer text. All useless crap by the way.

671
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:18,180
Well I don't know, the game might be cool. Okay the game might be cool but does it justify

672
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:20,780
the hundred dollar price tag on a 20 gig hard drive? No, because

673
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:24,900
you're getting the hard drive and all the HD cables which is really what's

674
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:28,260
selling me here because I would like to have the right cables. No, I'm talking about buying the hard drive by itself.

675
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:32,860
$100. But all this crap is getting preloaded on if you buy the

676
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:36,460
hard drive yeah and that's it's either if you buy it with the system

677
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:40,740
or by itself that's going to be on there so you get a game which is kinda cool

678
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:43,460
but you need the hard drive if you're going to play any of these games because you

679
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:46,180
guys download them to your hard drive. Oh the arcade stuff yeah.

680
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:49,740
Yeah the other game that they showed was Wick and the Fable of Souls

681
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:53,460
and I have no idea what that was it just looks like some RPG or

682
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:57,260
shooter game that has a tree in it so it's got a tree

683
00:39:57,260 --> 00:40:02,460
that's all I know. Good way to sum that up. It's interesting now the other thing

684
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:07,860
to disappoint fans, unfortunately, at launch. A couple of games have gone buh-bye, and those

685
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:13,260
would be Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter for all those Tom Clancy fans, and of course Frame

686
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:15,160
City Killer for all those Namco fans.

687
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:19,380
So, starting to push back a little bit there.

688
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:20,380
It's a good Valentine's Day gift.

689
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:24,560
Nothing says I love you like Tom Clancy, he's an advanced warfighter.

690
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:30,220
I'm sure. Speaking of Xbox, might as well roll on with Microsoft here. This week we

691
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:35,780
had Doom 3 Resurrection of Evil come out, not too often on the consoles, I mean it's

692
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:40,900
happened before, but not too often do you see expansions coming out for games where

693
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:46,100
you have to already own the first game to play this expansion, and that's what's going

694
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:47,700
on with the Doom 3 here.

695
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:48,700
Not quite.

696
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:49,700
Really?

697
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:50,700
No, it's its own thing.

698
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:51,700
Did I misunderstand the article?

699
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:52,700
Yes.

700
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:53,700
Oh, crap.

701
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:56,580
It's actually, the game's re-released, it's like Ninja Gate in black.

702
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:59,220
It's basically re-released with the PC expansion stuff.

703
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:03,500
we've got a couple more weapons and uh... more levels

704
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:06,220
that's not what somebody else told me something else so we go back as it is

705
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:08,220
maybe the pc version was like that

706
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:10,540
yes it was no original

707
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:11,420
well crap

708
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:13,940
well that's nothing special and just another game coming out now do three

709
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:14,900
was pretty cool

710
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:17,440
it's also the price points lower

711
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:21,020
it's a that's true twenty nine ninety three tramp or you need it can do

712
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:22,540
was the movie

713
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:25,180
oh yeah the trailer forget the movie

714
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:29,020
see it I'm not I want to see it and laugh at it and then watch the rock for

715
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:35,540
an hour that first-person thing was so hokey I'm sorry if the halo movie if the

716
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:39,140
halo trailer ends up looking like that I'm just I'm gonna laugh you know I

717
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:42,820
still have to remind our listeners you know speaking of movies Silent Hill

718
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:48,260
coming out next year yeah did you did you have something about like a I'm

719
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:52,620
still trying to find more on it but there is there's a couple more people

720
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:58,860
listed on IMDB like we can really you know say yeah IMDB but they have a link

721
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:04,940
to the article to the not an article but a interview with Roger Avery that I had

722
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:13,940
touched on a few weeks ago I remembered us getting as far as some of the other

723
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:18,620
actors in there we also have Jodelle Fairland Alice Cridge is that how her

724
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:25,140
It also goes a little bit more into the behind-the-scenes cast, but it's still Sean Bean.

725
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:26,140
That's cool.

726
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:31,780
At this point, we're getting a little late in the show, but that's all right.

727
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:35,060
It's never too late to open up the old mailbag and see what's going on, what our listeners

728
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:36,220
have said to us.

729
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:41,660
Of course, you can email the show by just sending us an email togo at orangelaungeradio.com.

730
00:42:41,660 --> 00:43:10,820
I am going to try to find a way to get this up on our site, hopefully, but it is of one

731
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:17,820
of the gameboy micro.

732
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:46,820
Also in response to Sasuke, I wanted to know what the ColecoVision is. I believe we were talking about the ColecoVision.

733
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:48,820
Yes, the C-O-L-E-C-O Vision.

734
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:52,820
Coleco also made swimming pools and cabbage patch kits.

735
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:55,820
I knew about the cabbage patch kits. I didn't know about the swimming pools.

736
00:43:55,820 --> 00:43:57,820
Yep.

737
00:43:57,820 --> 00:44:02,820
You know, a lot of gaming companies make other things. You may not know about, like, Konami and slot machines.

738
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:03,820
Yeah.

739
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:06,820
I know there's others, but that's the one that comes to mind because I like to gamble.

740
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:15,160
Also, Bradley, not to be confused with Arcadian42, also sent me the link to the GameSpot article

741
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:16,820
about pocket dogs.

742
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:17,820
Ah, okay.

743
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:22,060
Do you like it when the listeners try to clue us in a little bit?

744
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:23,060
No, it's cool.

745
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:24,140
We like it.

746
00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:25,980
Anyone else?

747
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:33,580
Actually, I got another email from Rob with two B's.

748
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:34,580
Okay.

749
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:39,820
He actually just had a little bit more about the super huge games.

750
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:43,520
I think I like this one sentence in particular here.

751
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:48,660
The industry is taking sides, so it's Betamax versus VHS all over again.

752
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:50,980
Oh, with the HD DVD and Blu-ray?

753
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:54,460
With the formats, exactly, but that does make perfect sense.

754
00:44:54,460 --> 00:45:01,840
Oh no, it absolutely makes sense, but I really hope before these things get into, we go too

755
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:05,880
too far with this, like we went with beta, because my family was the unfortunate family

756
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:06,880
that had the beta machine.

757
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:07,880
I had both.

758
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:12,240
The Betamax, you could copy anything off VHS past CopyGuard.

759
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:16,000
I know, but we couldn't afford both, so we only had the beta machine.

760
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,840
Whoops, we picked the wrong one, so I really don't want to see that happen again.

761
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:22,880
I hope this gets settled before it gets really out there.

762
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:26,680
I love the reminder about the Divix machine.

763
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:27,680
Remember the Divix?

764
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:29,200
Oh, sure.

765
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:35,840
So Penny Arcade and their character are the Demiks, I think that's hilarious.

766
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:42,000
Also about the worst game, see I always said it was UT, but he said it was Firefly Magic

767
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,100
Carpet.

768
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:48,960
What about Zelda Wand Gamelon?

769
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:51,280
I don't know, these are pretty rotten ones.

770
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:55,640
Frickin' play Sprung and tell me you didn't just play the worst game.

771
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:58,680
Or Ping Pals, pick up either one of those and tell me you just didn't play the worst

772
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:05,360
game I actually I at least Zelda amused me for a few seconds I don't know now

773
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:10,560
I'm one of our listeners wrote in Danny and I want to read this email sure

774
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:18,120
because I 100% freaking agree with it okay okay um I believe I speak for some

775
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:24,200
people when I say fuck IGN Wow okay just the other day I was trying to read a

776
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:27,360
gaming article when all of a sudden a random yellow circle covered over the

777
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:31,640
text I was reading. As it turned out, this was an ad, an ad that had obscured what I

778
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:37,280
was reading. After realizing what it was, I was instantly irritated. IGN is notorious

779
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:41,660
for planting obnoxious advertisements everywhere you try to visit, clicking a link, viewing

780
00:46:41,660 --> 00:46:45,860
an image, forced uncontrollable downloading of a video ad when you want to watch something.

781
00:46:45,860 --> 00:46:51,100
To be fair, this is a trend on the Internet as a whole that IGN is buying into, and I'm

782
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:54,940
sure is not the only gaming site, but of course one of the most prevalent.

783
00:46:54,940 --> 00:46:55,940
I don't get those.

784
00:46:55,940 --> 00:46:56,940
I paid for mine.

785
00:46:56,940 --> 00:47:00,380
Well, you're a corporate whore, anyway.

786
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:04,100
And there's the other thing on here, and how about disallowing QuickTime media for the

787
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:05,100
majority of the time?

788
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:09,780
I am on a Macintosh and Windows Media Player is atrocious to use and watch on a Mac, and

789
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:11,620
then again, Windows Media Player is just atrocious, period.

790
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:12,620
That's my opinion.

791
00:47:12,620 --> 00:47:16,620
What I want to bitch about IGN is all their downloads stop halfway.

792
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:18,620
Yeah, there's that too.

793
00:47:18,620 --> 00:47:24,620
But there's also in here, you'd think with all the advertising IGN puts up that they'd have the bandwidth to allow QuickTime.

794
00:47:24,620 --> 00:47:28,620
I don't know, they have QuickTime for everything. Once you're like an insider...

795
00:47:28,620 --> 00:47:29,620
You have to be a paid member.

796
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:30,620
You have to pay for it.

797
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:31,620
Sorry.

798
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:35,620
But when this bot came out of nowhere and bought the article I wanted to read, it was the last straw.

799
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:41,620
A few years ago, IGN was limiting how many images you could view per day, and now they're blocking the text you want to read.

800
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:45,380
I was starting to tolerate IGN a bit recently, but they have officially lost my respect to

801
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:46,700
them this across the line.

802
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:51,300
So basically, he's looking for alternatives to IGN's sudden game spot had turned out

803
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:52,820
very similarly.

804
00:47:52,820 --> 00:47:56,360
I actually greatly enjoy Eurogamer's News.

805
00:47:56,360 --> 00:48:02,840
Even if it's more geared toward the European audience, you get really good reviews, really

806
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:04,800
good news on things that are coming out.

807
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:07,240
They have an excellent download section.

808
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:10,740
There's also 1UP, which I actually mentioned looking at 1UP.com, and they've been good

809
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:11,740
to us.

810
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:12,740
OneUp's pretty good.

811
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:13,740
I like OneUp.

812
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:16,560
I also like the ones that are just the facts.

813
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,280
There's no pretty picture, just the facts.

814
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:19,760
I like the media-oriented sites.

815
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:24,240
Slashdot and Dig, and some of those ones are just the facts.

816
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:26,240
If you're looking for trailers, gametrailers.com.

817
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:27,240
Yeah, gametrailers.com.

818
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:29,880
If you just want movies and you don't got to pay, then it's great.

819
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:31,600
So there are alternatives out there.

820
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:34,720
And of course, other independent podcasts.

821
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:35,720
Exactly.

822
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:37,680
Support your independent podcaster.

823
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:38,680
Yes, please do.

824
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:39,680
All right.

825
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:41,680
That was a good email. Thank you.

826
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:44,680
But yeah, I have to say that voiced a great deal.

827
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:47,680
Oh, also, use Mozilla.

828
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:50,680
Use Mozilla and there's an extension you can use.

829
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:55,680
I use this to block Flash, like Adblock.

830
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:58,680
Search for Adblock Mozilla on Google and you'll find this.

831
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:05,680
It's a thing that allows you to block, like Mozilla as it is,

832
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:08,680
you can right click on an image and block it from ever seeing it.

833
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:12,960
seeing it but adblock takes it like one step further where you can block plugins on the

834
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:15,680
page and things so you can get rid of those little QuickTime movies and stuff.

835
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:16,680
It's beautiful.

836
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:17,680
Love it.

837
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:19,000
I really like Firefox for that.

838
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:23,560
You just right click on it and you go to block images from.

839
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:27,760
I understand the websites are just trying to make their money and that's perfectly fine

840
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:31,920
but at the same time there's smart ways of doing it and there's annoying ways of doing

841
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:32,920
it.

842
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:35,320
Yeah, opening up IGN should not crash my computer.

843
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:37,320
Amen to that.

844
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:38,320
Anything else?

845
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:44,320
We also got another email about Le Play 2-0, and actually I'm so dumb I just closed the email.

846
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:46,320
I'll try to credit you next week, I'm sorry.

847
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:53,320
About Le Play 2-0 combines water play with the world of video games featuring flashing lights and sounds.

848
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:58,320
Directional water jets move characters through traps and mazes.

849
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:04,320
There's Pokémon, Super Mario Bros., Donkey Kong, and in Canada only SpongeBob SquarePants.

850
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:10,080
But after looking at this thing though, it looks like those little toys that you used

851
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:16,160
to get in the 80s that you'd push the button and it shot water up into the thing.

852
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:19,320
Now this one, it's electronic, you control the direction on it.

853
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:22,520
This makes me think of those things where you squish the water and try to hit the loop

854
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:24,640
and put it on a pike or something.

855
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:25,640
Hmm.

856
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:26,640
Sounds weird.

857
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:29,480
I'd have to really see this thing in action, but that's really what it's making me think

858
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:30,480
of.

859
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:35,080
I don't know if I want to... I don't feel like getting in the pool to try this out, sorry.

860
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:38,640
Could you go to play2o.com

861
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:42,000
Okay. Anything else?

862
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:46,080
Well, I do, but I think I will let somebody else

863
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:50,320
talk for a moment. Oh no, go ahead, go ahead. Do you insist? Yeah, I insist.

864
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:55,040
Must you? I do. I don't have it up, so you got the email up. There was one that

865
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:55,360
was

866
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:58,000
did you get me mail to me right

867
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,720
sort of text that we close the email but i was sorry

868
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:03,880
i can get it up real fast here sorry

869
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:07,180
you know i'm glad that your room is not in the room when you say that it was

870
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:09,000
shut up while you guys are doing that

871
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:13,880
i've heard or i got it it was on line

872
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:18,600
it was uh... shall amongst it was a gay question from uh... steven s

873
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:21,620
uh... who by the way has a hilarious email address but of course i can read

874
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:23,000
it on air but it's hilarious

875
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:27,080
says in Shaolin Monks I've been playing with my friend and every time he gets a

876
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:29,480
fatality, brutality, or brutality he gets it

877
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:32,560
and my character doesn't. If you can help me figure this out it would be much

878
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:34,640
appreciated because I'm about ready to give up on this game.

879
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:38,880
Hey, I played Mortal Kombat Shaolin Monks and the fatality thing was really

880
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:40,160
ticking me off too.

881
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:44,240
Honestly, you're going to have to check that out on Game FAQ.

882
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:47,320
Game FAQs, gamefacts.com

883
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:51,040
because I unfortunately do not know the answer and I'm okay with admitting

884
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:52,520
that I do not know the answer.

885
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:55,740
So, um, go for it. Check that out.

886
00:51:55,740 --> 00:51:59,720
Um, and when you find out, let me know, because I want to know why I can't keep...

887
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:03,960
why I can't unlock any more fatalities in that game. I'm just being stupid or something, I don't know.

888
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:07,920
Well, I've got a couple more. I have, um, this week's UK releases.

889
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:11,840

00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:52,360
Oh my God, UFO Aftershock X3 Reunion, those are all coming out next week.

898
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:53,360
Alright, sounds good.

899
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:56,200
Alright, we're starting to get kind of laid on the show here.

900
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:57,200
Yes.

901
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:58,200
I had one last one.

902
00:52:58,200 --> 00:52:59,200
One last one.

903
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:00,200
Just a quick one.

904
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:01,200
Alright, make it quick.

905
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:04,720
The Australian High Court, to our Australian listeners, hello everybody.

906
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:06,340
PlayStation mod chips are legal, guys.

907
00:53:06,340 --> 00:53:08,420
You can mod the hell out of your PlayStation.

908
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:09,480
And it's all legal.

909
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:14,900
The whole thing behind that is it was their decision found that PlayStation chips's functions

910
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:19,800
were circumvented by modchips to allow unauthorized games to be played are not primarily copy

911
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:21,600
protection devices.

912
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:24,960
They really don't give a rat's ass whatever you play on your system as long as it's not

913
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:25,960
bootlegged.

914
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:27,720
Well, have fun down under with your modchips.

915
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:28,780
Import those games.

916
00:53:28,780 --> 00:53:30,720
Have fun.

917
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:32,200
Just a few quick stories for you guys here.

918
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:33,200
We're trying to wind down here.

919
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:36,260
I do want to say one other thing about the PSP.

920
00:53:36,260 --> 00:53:39,260
There's a virus scanner now available for the PSP.

921
00:53:39,260 --> 00:53:42,920
It's called P-Safe-P 1.1.

922
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:47,340
And I don't know why, this just kind of amuses me because, you know, now that PSP can actually

923
00:53:47,340 --> 00:53:52,540
be online and stuff, that they have to have these virus scan programs and stuff, it's

924
00:53:52,540 --> 00:53:53,540
amusing.

925
00:53:53,540 --> 00:53:57,420
It comes down to the same thing, don't run programs you don't know where they came from.

926
00:53:57,420 --> 00:54:01,460
Wasn't there a big outbreak of some program that was claimed to be the downgrader was

927
00:54:01,460 --> 00:54:02,460
a big virus?

928
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:04,940
Well, that was another fake downgrader.

929
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:08,700
Well, you just got to be careful about what you download.

930
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:12,100
Now Matt, you had another thing for us regarding some games.

931
00:54:12,100 --> 00:54:21,140
Yeah, real quick, they did a PS3 demonstration recently at the CEA Tech 2005 conference in

932
00:54:21,140 --> 00:54:26,700
Japan to show off the cell processor and one of the things that they were demonstrating

933
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:31,820
could be the possible evolution in the iToy, which is they actually had a demonstration

934
00:54:31,820 --> 00:54:37,620
where the iToy took a picture of the person and recreated a 3D model of their head, just

935
00:54:37,620 --> 00:54:42,400
like completely accurate and they're just saying that this is possible that

936
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:46,800
later on something like this could be used in the PS3 to actually put you in

937
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:47,280
the game

938
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:50,520
I mean that's freaky okay all right well interesting

939
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:54,080
anything else? That's all I've got

940
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:58,120
Well you know they've been trying to do that for years they had that thing with the gameplay camera

941
00:54:58,120 --> 00:55:01,120
what was it in perfect dark wasn't it?

942
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:04,360
yeah but that was that was yeah and they've done it for

943
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:08,360
That's just facial skinning. They have that for the iToy now.

944
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:13,360
But boy, that's just like pasting your face, but the 3D modeling and everything, that's crazy stuff.

945
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:17,360
Yeah, this is a 3D head. I mean, this is not just some stupid mapping.

946
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:21,360
I don't want to see how fat I look in a video game, okay? I don't need no 3D model.

947
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:28,360
I don't know what it is, but what just popped into my head is having the model taken and then like, for a new Rayman game, Raymanizing yourself.

948
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:30,360
That would be fun.

949
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:31,360
That'd be weird.

950
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:33,360
I love manipulation like that.

951
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:42,280
like that.

952
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:49,560
You know there was this big fan homebrew thing going on, Kings Quest 9, every cloak has a

953
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:54,680
silver lining, get this, they had all these volunteer people, like they had a 2000 page

954
00:55:54,680 --> 00:56:00,600
script going for it, 9 chapters, 450 characters, original music, original voice acting being

955
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:05,960
done for this whole thing, and a cease and desist was just laid on him this week by Vivendi

956
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:10,300
Universal Games, which, you know, acquired Sierra some time ago, which Sierra made the

957
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:11,580
King's Quest games.

958
00:56:11,580 --> 00:56:15,740
So this mat got put down on this, which is too bad, because King's Quest is kind of one

959
00:56:15,740 --> 00:56:18,780
of those games where I kind of, I'm always like, I wonder what ever happened to King's

960
00:56:18,780 --> 00:56:22,740
Quest, you know, I knew that there was like that eighth game that didn't really register

961
00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:26,320
on the radar too much, but then King's Quest kind of disappeared, so I would have been

962
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:30,580
excited to see something like this, a continuation of the story, and what a fan community!

963
00:56:30,580 --> 00:56:34,860
Honestly, what a community to be getting that many people involved in a project like that.

964
00:56:34,860 --> 00:56:35,860
That's great.

965
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:39,140
But unfortunately, I guess when you get that many people involved, you start to draw attention

966
00:56:39,140 --> 00:56:40,140
to yourself.

967
00:56:40,140 --> 00:56:42,100
So that's too bad, I guess.

968
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:46,700
Maybe they'll release it as like, Queen's Trip.

969
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:48,700
There's an idea.

970
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:51,100
Queen's Journey, Part 9.

971
00:56:51,100 --> 00:56:52,100
Peasants Quest.

972
00:56:52,100 --> 00:56:53,100
Yeah, yeah.

973
00:56:53,100 --> 00:56:54,900
Curse you, Choctaw!

974
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:59,760
Or, you know, maybe they could work out a deal where maybe Vivendi Universal could just

975
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:06,760
distribute this game and, you know, make some money, download it free off of their website.

976
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:09,880
Seriously, I mean, come on, some people still love King's Quest.

977
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:13,840
All right, last story, you guys, ready?

978
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:22,200
This is a brand new game coming out, I don't know how else to say this, Care Bears Catch

979
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:27,560
a Star is now coming out for the PC and Macintosh.

980
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:31,860
Of course, this is coming out right before the Care Bears Big Wish movie, which is coming

981
00:57:31,860 --> 00:57:38,280
out on DVD October 8th, or I'm sorry, that actually would have already come out here.

982
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:42,760
So that is the Care Bears of the 80s, brand new game.

983
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:46,020
Although they haven't changed how they look like they did with Strawberry Shortcake.

984
00:57:46,020 --> 00:57:49,400
My big wish is that they would just stay in the 80s.

985
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:52,360
You need the Care Bears stare, don't you?

986
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:54,200
Loki just needs a Care Bears stare.

987
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:57,240
I just don't care at all.

988
00:57:57,240 --> 00:58:00,680
I still remember the Care Bears and Wonderland movie, and that was awesome.

989
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:04,080
Hey, it's only 20 bucks! Can't argue with that?

990
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:08,460
Ooh! That's the end of the show. Final thoughts, Loki?

991
00:58:08,460 --> 00:58:12,080
I hate the Care Bears. Final thoughts, Dark Sakura?

992
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:15,580
Reject Pause Icons and Itchy,

993
00:58:15,580 --> 00:58:21,080
Tasty. My final thought is, somebody's got a case of the Mondays.

994
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:26,880
Alright, thank you guys so much. If they really take my stapler, I'm going to set the

995
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:30,680
building on fire. Thank you guys so much for downloading and listening to us. We

999
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:48,240
Lounge Radio Day. It is? I choose, really, Columbus Day. Oh, okay. All right. If you work for a bank, you've

1000
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:52,000
gotten the day off. Lucky you. Use it well. Listen to us all day long. All right, have a

1001
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,680
good one, guys. We'll see you next time on Orange Lounge Radio To Go.

1002
