00:00:00,189 --> 00:00:02,952
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, week of October 3rd, 2005.

4
00:00:19,389 --> 00:00:21,691
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello everybody, once again...

00:00:22,941 --> 00:00:28,622
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your home for all that news that gamers really want to know about.

6
00:00:28,962 --> 00:00:30,543
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks so much for subscribing to us.

7
00:00:30,583 --> 00:00:32,263
[SPEAKER_03]: We really do appreciate your support.

8
00:00:32,723 --> 00:00:34,603
[SPEAKER_03]: We are an independent production.

9
00:00:34,723 --> 00:00:40,485
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's just three buddies here doing a show out of a spare bedroom in one of our apartments, really.

10
00:00:41,065 --> 00:00:43,965
[SPEAKER_03]: So we appreciate you guys supporting just, you know, the independent podcast.

11
00:00:43,985 --> 00:00:47,446
[SPEAKER_03]: We do this because we love video games, and we never shut up about them.

12
00:00:47,666 --> 00:00:50,167
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't that right, Dark Sakura, one of my lovely co-hosts over there?

13
00:00:50,707 --> 00:00:52,047
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't shut up about anything ever.

14
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:53,592
[SPEAKER_03]: This is true.

15
00:00:54,052 --> 00:00:55,353
[SPEAKER_03]: Video games is one of them though, right?

16
00:00:55,553 --> 00:00:58,035
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'd have to say video games are probably up at the top of the list.

17
00:00:58,075 --> 00:00:59,496
[SPEAKER_00]: That and Serenity.

18
00:01:01,598 --> 00:01:03,559
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki's here as well, the Techmaster Loki.

19
00:01:03,819 --> 00:01:04,260
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I am.

20
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:04,840
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you doing?

21
00:01:05,441 --> 00:01:06,001
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm good.

22
00:01:06,261 --> 00:01:07,722
[SPEAKER_03]: And he never shuts up about video games either.

23
00:01:08,143 --> 00:01:14,327
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and in fact, even the people I work with who we sell video games and they still don't like listening to me.

24
00:01:15,188 --> 00:01:15,929
[SPEAKER_00]: But you love bacon.

25
00:01:16,689 --> 00:01:19,111
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I have my I Love Bacon shirt on.

26
00:01:19,271 --> 00:01:19,631
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

27
00:01:20,012 --> 00:01:20,372
[SPEAKER_02]: Good choice.

28
00:01:20,845 --> 00:01:21,625
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

29
00:01:45,031 --> 00:01:45,971
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, well, that's something.

30
00:01:46,412 --> 00:01:49,273
[SPEAKER_00]: I did go into Bark mode about three times this week, though, with other people.

31
00:01:49,573 --> 00:01:49,813
[SPEAKER_03]: Right on.

32
00:01:49,833 --> 00:01:51,514
[SPEAKER_03]: Were you able to get any cool unlocks that way?

33
00:01:51,774 --> 00:01:52,014
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

34
00:01:52,534 --> 00:02:02,498
[SPEAKER_00]: However, my friend has an extra fireman's hat and is going to lend it to me, because if you ever have the fireman's hat in your inventory at any time, you will automatically have the Dalmatian, even if you give the hat away.

35
00:02:03,198 --> 00:02:03,758
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

36
00:02:04,058 --> 00:02:04,338
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

37
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:06,219
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to get a Dalmatian next week.

38
00:02:06,279 --> 00:02:06,919
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to be honest.

39
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:08,620
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't been that into Nintendogs.

40
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:10,301
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of my interest in fading.

41
00:02:10,321 --> 00:02:11,801
[SPEAKER_00]: Did your puppies run away?

42
00:02:12,081 --> 00:02:13,262
[SPEAKER_03]: No, not yet, but they all have fleas.

43
00:02:14,172 --> 00:02:15,193
[SPEAKER_03]: because I haven't been bathing them.

44
00:02:16,074 --> 00:02:16,214
[SPEAKER_03]: Ew.

45
00:02:16,434 --> 00:02:16,695
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, well.

46
00:02:18,076 --> 00:02:19,277
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, what's your game of the week been like?

47
00:02:19,677 --> 00:02:27,065
[SPEAKER_02]: I tried Lost in Blue a bit for the DS, and that was kind of fun, and then had to play the stupid dogs because otherwise they'll run away.

48
00:02:28,146 --> 00:02:30,488
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm actually taking two of my copies back.

49
00:02:31,049 --> 00:02:31,589
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want them.

50
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:34,713
[SPEAKER_02]: The game's not that interesting, and after...

51
00:02:36,434 --> 00:02:42,196
[SPEAKER_03]: You did kind of make a mistake by buying all three versions, not realizing that all 18... I didn't realize it.

52
00:02:42,396 --> 00:02:45,117
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to bring your other versions so that I can get your dogs.

53
00:02:46,017 --> 00:02:46,457
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess.

54
00:02:46,517 --> 00:02:48,278
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll have to do that before I return them.

55
00:02:49,318 --> 00:02:53,299
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, so other than that, I've been playing DDR Extreme 2, and that was fun.

56
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:58,461
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good dance game, except my dance pads don't work it right now, so I have to play it on the controller.

57
00:02:59,181 --> 00:03:00,141
[SPEAKER_02]: Boring.

58
00:03:01,042 --> 00:03:01,722
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

59
00:03:02,062 --> 00:03:04,943
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when I was staring at my copy of Graffiti Kingdom this week,

60
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:08,951
[SPEAKER_02]: If it makes you feel any better my copy of We Love Katamari is still unwrapped

61
00:03:31,704 --> 00:03:33,125
[SPEAKER_03]: But you did finally get it.

62
00:03:33,145 --> 00:03:35,426
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I got it the night after the show.

63
00:03:35,526 --> 00:03:37,507
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not such a touchy subject for you anymore.

64
00:03:37,587 --> 00:03:38,387
[SPEAKER_00]: No, not as touchy.

65
00:03:38,507 --> 00:03:40,028
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very wrapped subject.

66
00:03:40,068 --> 00:03:41,269
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep it under wraps.

67
00:03:41,529 --> 00:03:42,750
[SPEAKER_03]: That was awful.

68
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:44,350
[SPEAKER_03]: That was really bad.

69
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:45,271
[SPEAKER_03]: Boo!

70
00:03:45,631 --> 00:03:46,612
[SPEAKER_03]: I did it on purpose.

71
00:03:47,672 --> 00:03:48,272
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else, Loki?

72
00:03:49,753 --> 00:03:50,754
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's really it.

73
00:03:50,994 --> 00:03:51,234
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

74
00:03:51,904 --> 00:03:53,805
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, things that I have been playing this week.

75
00:03:53,845 --> 00:03:55,906
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually checked out Pack and Roll for the Nintendo DS.

76
00:03:56,447 --> 00:03:57,827
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, kind of fun.

77
00:03:58,088 --> 00:03:58,668
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty cool.

78
00:03:58,748 --> 00:04:00,649
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one of those, like, kind of quickie games.

79
00:04:00,689 --> 00:04:07,493
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, it's a game that I don't think I could really see myself, like, oh, I'm going to sit down for three hours and just have a marathon Pack and Roll session.

80
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:14,397
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of one of those things where, like, yeah, I could, like, fire this up, play a level while I'm waiting for something else, then just save it and do it again later.

81
00:04:14,737 --> 00:04:18,759
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's kind of a nice, like, simple, relaxing action game.

82
00:04:19,705 --> 00:04:23,366
[SPEAKER_00]: I spent at least 30 minutes on it at E3.

83
00:04:23,386 --> 00:04:23,686
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

84
00:04:23,966 --> 00:04:27,007
[SPEAKER_03]: See, I didn't find it to be quite so addicting.

85
00:04:27,047 --> 00:04:27,748
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it was kind of cool.

86
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:29,088
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a really cool concept.

87
00:04:29,588 --> 00:04:33,289
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it kind of whores the stylus features of the DS out, but, you know, it's in a good way.

88
00:04:33,329 --> 00:04:34,590
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess that's what the stylus is for.

89
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:41,732
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the idea that you kind of use Pac-Man as like a trackball, although part of me kind of wonders what that game would be like if you actually had a trackball.

90
00:04:42,092 --> 00:04:47,334
[SPEAKER_03]: The game would surprisingly be a hell of a lot like Crystal Castles, that old, old Atari game.

91
00:04:47,434 --> 00:04:48,654
[SPEAKER_00]: It made me think of Marvel Madness.

92
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:53,483
[SPEAKER_03]: Marble Madness kind of, I thought, because with the dots and everything, it really reminded me of Crystal Castles.

93
00:04:53,783 --> 00:04:59,212
[SPEAKER_03]: But instead you were using the stylus to kind of draw your kind of roll with the pen.

94
00:04:59,233 --> 00:04:59,894
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was kind of neat.

95
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:01,577
[SPEAKER_03]: And you do like all these different moves.

96
00:05:03,249 --> 00:05:06,213
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still kind of only like a borderline recommendation for me, though.

97
00:05:06,253 --> 00:05:09,057
[SPEAKER_03]: I think if you're a fan of this type of genre, I think you'll get a kick out of this.

98
00:05:09,457 --> 00:05:15,325
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's also a type of thing that I couldn't see myself playing it for a heck of a long time.

99
00:05:15,365 --> 00:05:17,448
[SPEAKER_03]: I couldn't see myself playing this game until I beat it.

100
00:05:17,488 --> 00:05:18,509
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I'd kind of get sick of it.

101
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:20,152
[SPEAKER_03]: And the graphics weren't...

102
00:05:21,232 --> 00:05:25,115
[SPEAKER_03]: The graphics, it looked like a PlayStation game on my DS, which I guess is kind of cool.

103
00:05:25,476 --> 00:05:26,096
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't know.

104
00:05:26,156 --> 00:05:28,278
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think I really like the graphical style of the game.

105
00:05:28,498 --> 00:05:29,219
[SPEAKER_02]: It was kind of dumb.

106
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:30,640
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't care for it.

107
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:35,724
[SPEAKER_03]: But Pac-Man looked really cute in the little bottom window where he's the controller.

108
00:05:36,345 --> 00:05:37,446
[SPEAKER_02]: Better than Pac-Pix.

109
00:05:37,486 --> 00:05:38,467
[SPEAKER_02]: Pac-Pix sucked.

110
00:05:39,327 --> 00:05:41,149
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got rid of that game quick.

111
00:05:41,209 --> 00:05:42,250
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I got this game.

112
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:43,771
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was just like, eh.

113
00:05:44,732 --> 00:05:44,812
[SPEAKER_02]: Eh.

114
00:05:46,063 --> 00:06:14,185
[SPEAKER_03]: so borderline recommendation for pack and roll for me the other game I didn't play this enough I'm not going to make a final judgment on this game I did play a little bit of Lost in Blue it seemed a little I don't know if it's just not my type of game if I'm just not into those point and click games although I don't know for some reason I was like thinking like King's Quest but with the little added like you can actually use the stylus to dig in the sand and kind of explore seemed a little gimmicky to me but I don't

115
00:06:14,745 --> 00:06:17,088
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think I played enough of the game to really get a feel for this yet.

116
00:06:17,108 --> 00:06:20,453
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to give the game another shot, so I'm not going to make a final judgment on it yet, but I did check it out.

117
00:06:21,775 --> 00:06:22,996
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if I'm going to like this one, though.

118
00:06:23,056 --> 00:06:24,759
[SPEAKER_03]: It just doesn't seem like my kind of game, but we'll see.

119
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:26,361
[SPEAKER_02]: I played it for a little bit.

120
00:06:26,401 --> 00:06:31,588
[SPEAKER_02]: I played it for the first day that you're on the island, and it's like you have to do things really...

121
00:06:33,346 --> 00:06:37,128
[SPEAKER_02]: in order, otherwise your only player is going to die, because you start off with very little life.

122
00:06:37,328 --> 00:06:41,910
[SPEAKER_03]: It seemed like it would be really easy to lose in the beginning, a little frustrating, but I don't know.

123
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:43,231
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to wait and play them a little more.

124
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:44,272
[SPEAKER_02]: It was pretty frustrating.

125
00:06:44,352 --> 00:06:48,834
[SPEAKER_02]: I hear trying to hunt the animals and stuff later on is even more frustrating.

126
00:06:49,994 --> 00:06:52,276
[SPEAKER_02]: The games are very frustrating.

127
00:06:52,296 --> 00:06:54,117
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and the text boxes were horrible, too.

128
00:06:54,317 --> 00:06:58,979
[SPEAKER_03]: You only see one line of text at a time, and you have to wait, even though I put my display speed on fast.

129
00:06:59,397 --> 00:07:01,918
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like that method of showing text.

130
00:07:01,998 --> 00:07:05,560
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know if I'm going to like this one, guys, but I'm not making a final judgment yet.

131
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,840
[SPEAKER_03]: There might be something that happens.

132
00:07:07,441 --> 00:07:10,182
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of games I first play and I don't like them, and then I warm up to them later.

133
00:07:10,202 --> 00:07:11,122
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to check it out.

134
00:07:11,242 --> 00:07:13,163
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of games coming out next month I want for the DS.

135
00:07:13,203 --> 00:07:14,024
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Trauma Center.

136
00:07:14,224 --> 00:07:14,864
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to be fun.

137
00:07:14,884 --> 00:07:15,885
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to check out Trauma Center as well.

138
00:07:16,205 --> 00:07:18,266
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something I'm waiting on for the GBA.

139
00:07:18,906 --> 00:07:19,206
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that?

140
00:07:19,346 --> 00:07:19,786
[SPEAKER_00]: A whole lot.

141
00:07:20,007 --> 00:07:21,047
[SPEAKER_00]: Gunstar Superheroes.

142
00:07:21,467 --> 00:07:21,947
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

143
00:07:21,967 --> 00:07:22,968
[SPEAKER_03]: That game looks like it's going to be awesome.

144
00:07:23,388 --> 00:07:25,890
[SPEAKER_03]: One other game I checked out this week was Dance Dance Revolution Extreme 2.

145
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:33,957
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, Orange Launch Radio was started on the music video games and kind of grew beyond that, but I still have a place in my heart for the music video games.

146
00:07:34,297 --> 00:07:42,544
[SPEAKER_03]: Dance Dance Revolution Extreme 2, if you are a fan of the dancing games in any capacity, you must, I highly recommend Dance Dance Revolution Extreme 2.

147
00:07:43,605 --> 00:07:50,511
[SPEAKER_03]: I talked about this a lot more on Sunday night's live three-hour show, but I think it really kind of transitioned...

148
00:07:51,089 --> 00:07:52,731
[SPEAKER_03]: Beatmania 2DX's Drill Mode

149
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:05,491
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

150
00:08:23,356 --> 00:08:24,257
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

151
00:08:49,651 --> 00:09:01,860
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're more of a casual fan or if you're curious about DDR, I would recommend you start on Max 2, which was from two years ago, but it had a very solid song list, and I think it was a lot more accessible for people who hadn't really played DDR before.

152
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,581
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's just my recommendation.

153
00:09:03,861 --> 00:09:05,822
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise, graphics in the game are great.

154
00:09:05,862 --> 00:09:08,484
[SPEAKER_03]: They gave every song a unique music video this time.

155
00:09:08,524 --> 00:09:08,924
[SPEAKER_03]: It's great.

156
00:09:09,205 --> 00:09:10,005
[SPEAKER_03]: The sound, of course.

157
00:09:10,426 --> 00:09:11,406
[SPEAKER_03]: Kick-butt song list.

158
00:09:11,466 --> 00:09:15,409
[SPEAKER_03]: Couple of licenses I didn't like, but that's bound to happen when you have such a diverse song list.

159
00:09:16,602 --> 00:09:18,703
[SPEAKER_03]: and the gameplay, it's DDR.

160
00:09:19,483 --> 00:09:20,164
[SPEAKER_03]: What else can I say?

161
00:09:20,844 --> 00:09:22,605
[SPEAKER_03]: Highly recommend if you're a fan of music games.

162
00:09:23,665 --> 00:09:29,167
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of borderline if you're not so much, if you just are interested in dance games and want to get into the series.

163
00:09:29,407 --> 00:09:32,729
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to disagree with most of the music selection though because I wasn't too impressed.

164
00:09:32,949 --> 00:09:33,449
[SPEAKER_03]: With what you heard?

165
00:09:34,437 --> 00:09:38,340
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was a bunch of repetitive, same old trance.

166
00:09:38,561 --> 00:09:44,246
[SPEAKER_03]: I think when you see what they picked from the old games to put next to it, though, I think it makes it a lot more solid.

167
00:09:44,286 --> 00:09:47,889
[SPEAKER_03]: They really took a lot of the things the fans have been asking for for years.

168
00:09:48,349 --> 00:09:52,473
[SPEAKER_03]: Sakura, Daikinkai, Cartoon Heroes, Sync, it's all in there.

169
00:09:52,813 --> 00:09:57,918
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's kind of nice that Konami really listened to their DDR fans on this one.

170
00:09:59,239 --> 00:09:59,479
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway...

171
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:06,368
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually did have something that I had forgotten to mention earlier.

172
00:10:07,948 --> 00:10:12,731
[SPEAKER_00]: Back to the Gunstar Heroes release, there's actually going to be a Sega Ages treasure chest.

173
00:10:13,551 --> 00:10:15,492
[SPEAKER_00]: I found this on Treasure's homepage.

174
00:10:16,372 --> 00:10:19,614
[SPEAKER_00]: It's featuring Gunstar Heroes Dynamite Headdy Alien Soldier.

175
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:26,097
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, in the Sega Ages 2500 collection, it'll be sold for 2,500 yen.

176
00:10:26,137 --> 00:10:28,278
[SPEAKER_03]: And I hope that comes out here.

177
00:10:28,709 --> 00:10:30,852
[SPEAKER_00]: and also Treasure is doing the Bleach game.

178
00:10:31,933 --> 00:10:33,295
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's off of the anime.

179
00:10:33,776 --> 00:10:33,956
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm.

180
00:10:34,236 --> 00:10:34,456
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

181
00:10:35,037 --> 00:10:35,217
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.

182
00:10:36,138 --> 00:10:37,420
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's Treasure, it's gotta be good.

183
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:40,504
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I actually liked the Sega collection they put out.

184
00:10:40,544 --> 00:10:46,672
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people really panned it and said it was awful, and I guess that's probably because of the Golden Axe remake, but I thought it was a good deal.

185
00:10:47,076 --> 00:10:49,377
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was better than that Namco collection that just came out.

186
00:10:49,537 --> 00:10:56,101
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought the Sega one was way better, but... I didn't buy it because we've already, so far, have some of the Sega Ages games we went to since we imported them.

187
00:10:56,761 --> 00:10:59,282
[SPEAKER_02]: Have any of you guys picked up the Midway Arcade Treasures 3 yet?

188
00:10:59,342 --> 00:10:59,502
[SPEAKER_03]: Not 3.

189
00:11:00,203 --> 00:11:04,585
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm definitely interested because it has... I didn't even realize this game was in it, but it has Iron Man's off-road in it.

190
00:11:04,885 --> 00:11:09,487
[SPEAKER_03]: That was, like, my favorite racing game, which is kind of not even really, like, it's borderline racing.

191
00:11:10,228 --> 00:11:11,208
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I want to check that out.

192
00:11:11,548 --> 00:11:12,449
[SPEAKER_03]: I've heard good things about it.

193
00:11:13,029 --> 00:11:14,050
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you what broke my heart.

194
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:14,510
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm.

195
00:11:15,843 --> 00:11:26,752
[SPEAKER_00]: Our landlord, who's actually good friends of ours, cleaned out some stuff out of their attic in the garage and brought down an Atari 2600 wood grain that had cobwebs all over it.

196
00:11:26,772 --> 00:11:30,535
[SPEAKER_00]: It made my heart break to have a box full of games.

197
00:11:30,595 --> 00:11:32,417
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, no!

198
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:35,880
[SPEAKER_00]: Except it was like that slow motion, no!

199
00:11:37,781 --> 00:11:39,363
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki got me thinking about racing games.

200
00:11:39,443 --> 00:11:40,964
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you hear about What's Coming to America?

201
00:11:40,984 --> 00:11:41,064
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

202
00:11:41,533 --> 00:11:42,394
[SPEAKER_03]: Mario Kart GP 64DD Collection

203
00:12:05,563 --> 00:12:06,164
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

204
00:12:26,518 --> 00:12:33,803
[SPEAKER_03]: and the first thing is we're going to give away a copy of the DDR Extreme 2 V-Rare as well as a copy of the Max 2 V-Rare.

205
00:12:33,883 --> 00:12:38,947
[SPEAKER_03]: We gave one away on the live show last week and we told you guys on the podcast you had a chance to enter this week.

206
00:12:39,367 --> 00:12:45,071
[SPEAKER_03]: Many of you did, so DarkSakura, pull a number out of the hat and let's see who's going to win the copy of the V-Rares.

207
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:46,552
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember guys, these aren't...

208
00:12:46,992 --> 00:12:49,053
[SPEAKER_03]: Games, they're the VRares, the soundtracks.

209
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:51,375
[SPEAKER_03]: Some folks in their email subject said, I want to win the games.

210
00:12:51,615 --> 00:12:53,536
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, guys, it's just the soundtracks.

211
00:12:53,596 --> 00:12:54,636
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have that big a budget yet.

212
00:12:54,997 --> 00:12:56,477
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, who are we giving it to?

213
00:12:56,517 --> 00:12:56,998
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the number?

214
00:12:57,198 --> 00:12:58,118
[SPEAKER_03]: Number 28.

215
00:12:58,338 --> 00:12:58,999
[SPEAKER_03]: Number 28.

216
00:12:59,599 --> 00:13:00,520
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, let's see.

217
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:01,700
[SPEAKER_03]: It's 15.

218
00:13:02,261 --> 00:13:03,361
[SPEAKER_03]: This will be number 30.

219
00:13:03,481 --> 00:13:04,842
[SPEAKER_03]: This is 28 right here.

220
00:13:05,042 --> 00:13:15,028
[SPEAKER_03]: Our winner is Joseph E. Joseph E is the winner of the other soundtracks we're going to give away there.

221
00:13:16,042 --> 00:13:23,107
[SPEAKER_03]: his email address says red star in it so I'm guessing that's his handle there so congratulations to you you've won the other soundtracks good job

222
00:13:25,729 --> 00:13:28,952
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, what we're going to give away, we're going to give away... Now, this is a game that we're giving away.

223
00:13:28,972 --> 00:13:32,915
[SPEAKER_03]: We're giving away a copy of In the Groove, and this is another dance game that's out.

224
00:13:32,975 --> 00:13:34,256
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a lot of dance games to give away.

225
00:13:34,276 --> 00:13:36,517
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we going to give away some non-dance games in the coming weeks, Loki?

226
00:13:36,698 --> 00:13:36,858
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

227
00:13:36,998 --> 00:13:37,358
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, we are.

228
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:38,959
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

229
00:13:39,099 --> 00:13:41,701
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, we love dance games, but we've got to give away some other stuff, too.

230
00:13:42,002 --> 00:13:48,046
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, this is a copy of In the Groove that has been autographed, quote-unquote, by all the hosts here at Orange Lounge Radio.

231
00:13:48,547 --> 00:13:54,391
[SPEAKER_03]: And what you had to do was write a haiku about In the Groove, and it had to be five syllables, seven syllables...

232
00:13:56,025 --> 00:13:59,046
[SPEAKER_03]: 3 syllables, not 575, because that's a horrible inside joke.

233
00:13:59,926 --> 00:14:01,386
[SPEAKER_03]: And Loki is going to sweeten the deal.

234
00:14:01,426 --> 00:14:02,867
[SPEAKER_03]: You're throwing in something else, aren't you?

235
00:14:03,207 --> 00:14:09,008
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm throwing in a t-shirt that says, In the Courtroom, but it's in the style of the logo for In the Groove.

236
00:14:09,528 --> 00:14:10,009
[SPEAKER_03]: Very nice.

237
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:12,629
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, you know, they got sued by Konami.

238
00:14:12,749 --> 00:14:15,650
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to throw in something that says, In the Courtroom.

239
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:15,950
[SPEAKER_03]: Lovely.

240
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:23,472
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we're also going to give away to all of our winners, not just the folks who won the In the Groove,

241
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:29,624
[SPEAKER_03]: we have some Silent Hill 3 stickers that were given to us by somebody at Konami so we're going to give

242
00:14:30,391 --> 00:14:30,711
[SPEAKER_03]: SILENT HILL 3

243
00:14:58,726 --> 00:15:01,268
[SPEAKER_03]: Minds, Mods, and much more.

244
00:15:01,868 --> 00:15:05,591
[SPEAKER_03]: In the Groove will help you score, just not dates.

245
00:15:06,231 --> 00:15:07,012
[SPEAKER_00]: That was brilliant.

246
00:15:07,212 --> 00:15:07,772
[SPEAKER_03]: That was great.

247
00:15:07,792 --> 00:15:08,473
[SPEAKER_03]: That's our runner-up.

248
00:15:08,493 --> 00:15:09,293
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually had a rhyme in it.

249
00:15:09,473 --> 00:15:09,974
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's good.

250
00:15:10,154 --> 00:15:12,535
[SPEAKER_03]: That's our runner-up, AsianBuddyPaul.

251
00:15:12,656 --> 00:15:13,856
[SPEAKER_03]: AsianBuddyPaul is our runner-up.

252
00:15:14,016 --> 00:15:15,097
[SPEAKER_00]: Congratulations.

253
00:15:15,277 --> 00:15:16,598
[SPEAKER_03]: And here is our winner.

254
00:15:17,939 --> 00:15:19,520
[SPEAKER_03]: You want a haiku?

255
00:15:20,341 --> 00:15:21,922
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe about In the Groove?

256
00:15:22,739 --> 00:15:24,061
[SPEAKER_03]: They got sued.

257
00:15:24,501 --> 00:15:25,402
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the best.

258
00:15:25,483 --> 00:15:30,148
[SPEAKER_03]: That was Justin M is our winner of the In the Groove contest.

259
00:15:30,188 --> 00:15:30,949
[SPEAKER_03]: Congratulations.

260
00:15:31,009 --> 00:15:31,570
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay.

261
00:15:32,171 --> 00:15:32,471
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

262
00:15:32,832 --> 00:15:33,352
[SPEAKER_03]: Good job, guys.

263
00:15:33,412 --> 00:15:34,494
[SPEAKER_03]: We did get lots of good ones.

264
00:15:34,654 --> 00:15:35,515
[SPEAKER_03]: We did get lots of good ones.

265
00:15:35,535 --> 00:15:36,656
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys crack us up.

266
00:15:36,716 --> 00:15:37,197
[SPEAKER_03]: So good job.

267
00:15:37,738 --> 00:15:39,580
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to do more creativity competitions.

268
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,241
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.

269
00:15:40,919 --> 00:15:42,000
[SPEAKER_00]: The Xbox Chief Officer, Robbie Bach

270
00:15:58,127 --> 00:16:21,115
[SPEAKER_03]: Expects half of all Xbox 360 owners to be on Xbox Live In the article it goes on to say that only about 10% of current Xbox users Which would be about 2 million people Use the current version of Xbox Live But because they're going to have this free silver version of Xbox Live That's going to be on the 360 The chief officer there believes that 50%

271
00:16:22,435 --> 00:16:23,095
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

272
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:55,429
[SPEAKER_03]: Because what, Silver, we did this a few weeks back.

273
00:16:55,449 --> 00:16:56,909
[SPEAKER_03]: We were talking about the differences between Silver and Gold.

274
00:16:56,929 --> 00:17:01,310
[SPEAKER_03]: Silver just basically got you on there and you could communicate with people, but you couldn't really play them, right?

275
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:02,550
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to go to Gold for that.

276
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:03,230
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be correct.

277
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:08,912
[SPEAKER_03]: So if they end up saying that 70% of the people are on Xbox Live, well, does that mean 70% of the people are playing games on there?

278
00:17:09,772 --> 00:17:10,112
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

279
00:17:10,332 --> 00:17:10,892
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know.

280
00:17:11,292 --> 00:17:12,432
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how much weight this story holds.

281
00:17:12,452 --> 00:17:13,273
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just huge numbers, that's all.

282
00:17:13,373 --> 00:17:19,054
[SPEAKER_03]: I was kind of surprised this story got as much attention as it did because I'm like, so if it's free, yeah, people are going to use it.

283
00:17:19,194 --> 00:17:19,454
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

284
00:17:20,107 --> 00:17:22,309
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that wins the award of the evening.

285
00:17:22,429 --> 00:17:22,770
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

286
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:23,530
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

287
00:17:24,651 --> 00:17:27,834
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, you actually had a story about the Xbox 360's launch as well, didn't you?

288
00:17:28,134 --> 00:17:34,860
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I got an email from one of our listeners, one of our regular writers as well.

289
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:35,581
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, right on.

290
00:17:35,641 --> 00:17:36,762
[SPEAKER_00]: From Rob with two B's.

291
00:17:39,144 --> 00:17:45,309
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to go ahead and read this email real quick just because I think it's very well written and brings up a good point.

292
00:17:46,871 --> 00:17:51,058
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been hitting the internet gaming news about Microsoft rejecting the Blu-ray DVD format.

293
00:17:51,159 --> 00:17:54,104
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not really interested in the reasons, but rather why it's an issue at all.

294
00:17:54,585 --> 00:17:56,188
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe the crew can help me with that.

295
00:17:56,448 --> 00:17:58,853
[SPEAKER_00]: And I actually thought it would be a good thing to bring up for discussion.

296
00:18:00,077 --> 00:18:04,300
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless you have three hours of video, why would one DVD be insufficient for a game?

297
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:10,565
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason I ask myself this is, how can there be so much code and support files to engulf an entire DVD?

298
00:18:11,005 --> 00:18:22,954
[SPEAKER_00]: The compiled code itself should be a fraction of the entire content, but I've noticed that games of practically the same complexity as Tetris are three megabytes and higher.

299
00:18:23,414 --> 00:18:27,137
[SPEAKER_00]: This can only mean developer kits, uncompressed files, and non-optimized code.

300
00:18:27,737 --> 00:18:28,258
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching!

301
00:18:45,951 --> 00:18:51,876
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that accepted, it still has to be unnecessarily large support files that really push them over the edge.

302
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:57,540
[SPEAKER_00]: Overly large and or detailed bitmaps compressed along with the code instead of as bitmaps.

303
00:18:58,301 --> 00:18:59,582
[SPEAKER_00]: The same with video and sound.

304
00:18:59,662 --> 00:19:03,044
[SPEAKER_00]: It may not use more of the file-specific compression algorithms.

305
00:19:03,485 --> 00:19:07,988
[SPEAKER_00]: It brings me to the conclusion that if the file fills more than a DVD, you may want to reconsider your content.

306
00:19:08,448 --> 00:19:11,631
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that you're not adding fluff to distract the player from the core game.

307
00:19:12,011 --> 00:19:12,612
[SPEAKER_00]: It is absolutely

308
00:19:13,512 --> 00:19:15,473
[SPEAKER_00]: from the core game is absolutely piece of crap.

309
00:19:15,994 --> 00:19:18,135
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost every movie license game fits this description.

310
00:19:19,095 --> 00:19:19,596
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

311
00:19:20,396 --> 00:19:28,961
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, my initial thought as to why you would need so much space, though, is that isn't the Xbox 3, if I'm not mistaken, isn't Microsoft forcing all the Xbox 360 games to be high-def compatible?

312
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:30,662
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe so.

313
00:19:30,742 --> 00:19:31,702
[SPEAKER_03]: Which I think is a good thing.

314
00:19:32,203 --> 00:19:33,023
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendo, are you listening?

315
00:19:34,584 --> 00:19:37,746
[SPEAKER_03]: And that would take up more space by default, I would think.

316
00:19:37,766 --> 00:19:39,306
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it would take up a full DVD.

317
00:19:39,346 --> 00:19:40,107
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think it's...

318
00:19:40,706 --> 00:19:45,127
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing is, when you're pushing these higher-res games, you're going to have higher-res textures.

319
00:19:45,487 --> 00:19:49,148
[SPEAKER_02]: More of them, if you've seen Project Gotham Racing, the whole buildings are textured.

320
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:50,788
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, it takes up more space.

321
00:19:50,868 --> 00:19:53,008
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not coding that's going to take up space at all.

322
00:19:53,048 --> 00:19:54,608
[SPEAKER_02]: Coding is tiny.

323
00:19:55,389 --> 00:19:58,689
[SPEAKER_02]: It's basically all these textures and audio and stuff that you've got.

324
00:19:58,709 --> 00:20:04,350
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know how many channels of audio you've got on the 360 and stuff, 5.1 and everything.

325
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:07,791
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the difference between why a DVD video file is 4GB

326
00:20:09,378 --> 00:20:11,798
[SPEAKER_02]: and a DivX file is only 600 megs.

327
00:20:12,099 --> 00:20:15,539
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, in quality, you're going to see a big difference there, too.

328
00:20:15,979 --> 00:20:23,601
[SPEAKER_02]: And Blu-ray, well, the only reason they're not going Blu-ray is because Sony's the one that's making Blu-ray, so, duh, they're not going to support their competitor.

329
00:20:24,921 --> 00:20:26,441
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree, though, with what's being said about it.

330
00:20:26,481 --> 00:20:28,282
[SPEAKER_03]: It really comes down to the quality of games.

331
00:20:28,562 --> 00:20:36,103
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there's going to be those crap games that don't make good use of the space, but I really think there will be games out there that are just going to have some stunning...

332
00:20:36,584 --> 00:20:42,529
[SPEAKER_03]: Cutscenes and things that could take up feasibly more room than a normal DVD could handle.

333
00:20:43,549 --> 00:20:50,775
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if there'll be any launch titles, but I think down the line, if there's that room for expansion, naturally the games have to grow.

334
00:20:51,349 --> 00:20:52,130
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching!

335
00:21:12,558 --> 00:21:18,302
[SPEAKER_00]: They will have to use the hard drive, but as we know, developers can't assume the hard drive will always be there for the 360.

336
00:21:19,283 --> 00:21:24,066
[SPEAKER_00]: So his question is, do you see this as a growing trend where we're going to see more eye candy and less gameplay?

337
00:21:27,731 --> 00:21:30,212
[SPEAKER_03]: I think unfortunately that's kind of... It's happening already.

338
00:21:30,232 --> 00:21:31,752
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's been a trend that's been happening already.

339
00:21:32,233 --> 00:21:32,693
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.

340
00:21:32,733 --> 00:21:38,955
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's games... But you know, sometimes there's games out there that have a lot of good eye candy, but they have good gameplay too, like Xenosaga comes to mind.

341
00:21:38,995 --> 00:21:43,377
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, God, that game was like half just sit and watch the cutscenes, but it was still a good game.

342
00:21:46,332 --> 00:21:50,013
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think, you know, and I think the other person who emailed, was that Rob?

343
00:21:50,213 --> 00:21:50,674
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

344
00:21:51,014 --> 00:21:56,076
[SPEAKER_03]: I think what he said there about the movie franchise games are some of the biggest culprits of that stuff.

345
00:21:56,156 --> 00:21:58,056
[SPEAKER_03]: Not always, but usually the biggest culprits of that stuff.

346
00:21:58,376 --> 00:21:59,737
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he made an excellent point with that.

347
00:21:59,777 --> 00:22:05,339
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, yeah, those games have always been about the eye candy a lot of times and making you remember the movie and things.

348
00:22:06,805 --> 00:22:08,425
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's kind of a trend that's going on already.

349
00:22:09,046 --> 00:22:11,466
[SPEAKER_03]: And it'll just continue to go.

350
00:22:11,646 --> 00:22:19,068
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly think that that was the big thing that spawned the whole PlayStation is better than Saturn bullshit of a few years ago.

351
00:22:19,808 --> 00:22:25,409
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing is, though, is that most of the people that were saying that never imported a single Saturn game.

352
00:22:25,609 --> 00:22:27,109
[SPEAKER_00]: And were not 2D gamers.

353
00:22:27,649 --> 00:22:29,430
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this goes all the way back to Super Nintendo.

354
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:31,150
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember those games that would whore Mode 7?

355
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:31,970
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

356
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:33,971
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was really nothing else to it.

357
00:22:34,011 --> 00:22:35,371
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just, oh, look at the pretty Mode 7.

358
00:22:37,049 --> 00:22:43,719
[SPEAKER_00]: But then again, the Super Nintendo, they were one of the first systems to do polygons.

359
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,026
[SPEAKER_00]: Although actually there was a system out before that that did it, but not in America.

360
00:22:48,996 --> 00:22:54,598
[SPEAKER_00]: The PC Engine Duo had a game called Sapphire that was one of their arcade card games.

361
00:22:55,779 --> 00:23:00,361
[SPEAKER_00]: That system was so intelligent to have those upgradable cards to support the different games.

362
00:23:00,961 --> 00:23:03,062
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've played this game.

363
00:23:03,422 --> 00:23:06,523
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got really pretty graphics in it for its time.

364
00:23:07,243 --> 00:23:09,204
[SPEAKER_00]: And in-game polygons.

365
00:23:09,224 --> 00:23:10,945
[SPEAKER_03]: And there were some great Mode 7 games.

366
00:23:10,965 --> 00:23:13,026
[SPEAKER_03]: Pilotwings I loved and some of the other older ones.

367
00:23:13,046 --> 00:23:14,126
[SPEAKER_00]: We had Star Fox.

368
00:23:14,306 --> 00:23:15,507
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, even effects in...

369
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:22,082
[SPEAKER_03]: and, um, like Dracula X. But see, you had the Star Fox game, but then there was some buggy racing game or something that was stupid.

370
00:23:22,122 --> 00:23:22,602
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't like it.

371
00:23:22,682 --> 00:23:24,203
[SPEAKER_03]: It was Step Race FX.

372
00:23:24,423 --> 00:23:25,043
[SPEAKER_03]: Step Race FX.

373
00:23:25,063 --> 00:23:27,284
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that was, I didn't like that.

374
00:23:27,444 --> 00:23:32,126
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, but, uh, the, uh, some of the other, F-Zero.

375
00:23:32,726 --> 00:23:32,906
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

376
00:23:33,838 --> 00:23:34,599
[SPEAKER_00]: F-Zero was mid-seven.

377
00:23:34,739 --> 00:23:34,939
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

378
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:35,820
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got to move on, though.

379
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:40,383
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you want to email us, send us an email at togo at orangeloungeradio.com.

380
00:23:40,403 --> 00:23:41,864
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll get to some more emails a little later in the show.

381
00:23:41,924 --> 00:23:42,084
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes?

382
00:23:42,224 --> 00:23:42,444
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

383
00:23:42,944 --> 00:23:45,546
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, you had a story about, now, the Xbox 360.

384
00:23:45,586 --> 00:23:49,148
[SPEAKER_03]: There was some type of teaser site going on, and the countdown finished this week.

385
00:23:49,289 --> 00:23:50,609
[SPEAKER_03]: What happened?

386
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:53,992
[SPEAKER_02]: OriginXbox360.com.

387
00:23:55,192 --> 00:24:00,336
[SPEAKER_02]: It would have been great if you live in the UK, because guess what?

388
00:24:00,496 --> 00:24:01,637
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a UK launch site.

389
00:24:01,737 --> 00:24:01,857
[SPEAKER_02]: It's

390
00:24:02,867 --> 00:24:12,891
[SPEAKER_02]: You basically, you can enter to win a trip to the launch party that's in, I guess, Vegas, if I remember correctly, or New York, in the United States.

391
00:24:13,011 --> 00:24:15,072
[SPEAKER_02]: But you have to be in the UK in order to enter this.

392
00:24:15,693 --> 00:24:21,215
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, the website was teasing it with some cut-out pictures of rabbits and this giant tree that was growing.

393
00:24:22,195 --> 00:24:27,077
[SPEAKER_02]: And at the very end, you have these rabbits, and the whole thing reminds me of Monty Python, the way it's done.

394
00:24:27,317 --> 00:24:28,478
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, the rabbits, you know,

395
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:33,747
[SPEAKER_02]: One of them eats the fruit that makes them hallucinate, and then you go to the maiden site.

396
00:24:34,207 --> 00:24:35,347
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a complete letdown.

397
00:24:35,407 --> 00:24:40,709
[SPEAKER_02]: We were thinking it was going to be something cool, but unless you were in the UK, it was not.

398
00:24:41,429 --> 00:24:43,470
[SPEAKER_00]: But we do have listeners in the UK, so hey.

399
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:44,670
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, good for you guys.

400
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:45,430
[SPEAKER_00]: Congratulations.

401
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:46,430
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a great site.

402
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:46,731
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cute.

403
00:24:46,791 --> 00:24:50,352
[SPEAKER_02]: It has rabbits that talk, and they're little bunny things.

404
00:24:51,392 --> 00:24:53,593
[SPEAKER_02]: I love bunnies, and then ten bunnies would be good.

405
00:24:53,873 --> 00:24:57,134
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem is they multiply too fast.

406
00:24:59,605 --> 00:25:00,225
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't know.

407
00:25:00,325 --> 00:25:01,666
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a really cool site.

408
00:25:02,506 --> 00:25:04,807
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, it's only for the UK.

409
00:25:04,827 --> 00:25:06,507
[SPEAKER_03]: The punchline sucked, in other words.

410
00:25:07,007 --> 00:25:16,650
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really dumb, because the whole thing... If you have a launch site like this, and you're basically making it seem like, oh, the world's connected... Except for you people in the US.

411
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:18,631
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not connected to the world, so...

412
00:25:19,417 --> 00:25:20,218
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

413
00:25:42,737 --> 00:25:46,380
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura wants to let you guys know what's going on for the release calendar in Europe.

414
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,422
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a number of games coming out this week.

415
00:25:49,122 --> 00:25:56,788
[SPEAKER_00]: Black and White 2 for the PC, Armored Core Nexus, Geist, King of Fighters 2003 for Xbox.

416
00:25:56,989 --> 00:25:57,769
[SPEAKER_00]: That's been out for a while.

417
00:25:58,590 --> 00:25:59,170
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, yeah.

418
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:02,913
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Nintendogs is coming out in the UK on the 7th.

419
00:26:03,634 --> 00:26:08,718
[SPEAKER_00]: Shattered Union, Stargate 1, SG-1, which I actually really want to play.

420
00:26:09,819 --> 00:26:12,001
[SPEAKER_00]: Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas, The Pumpkin King.

421
00:26:13,739 --> 00:26:17,641
[SPEAKER_00]: Also on the 14th coming out, we've got Driver for the GBA.

422
00:26:18,321 --> 00:26:18,761
[SPEAKER_02]: Stay away.

423
00:26:18,861 --> 00:26:20,582
[SPEAKER_02]: Driver 3 for the GBA.

424
00:26:20,602 --> 00:26:21,542
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Driver 3, sorry.

425
00:26:22,682 --> 00:26:30,025
[SPEAKER_00]: Marvel Nemesis Rise of the Imperfects, Namco Museum Battle Collection, Rengoku Tower of Purgatory, Serious Sam 2.

426
00:26:30,785 --> 00:26:32,086
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are some of the ones coming out.

427
00:26:33,066 --> 00:26:38,828
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, I don't know why it took so long, but they're also on the 21st getting Dragon Ball Z, Budokai Tengaiichi.

428
00:26:39,697 --> 00:26:42,198
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, Budokai Tenkaichi hasn't come out yet.

429
00:26:42,338 --> 00:26:44,559
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not coming out until November.

430
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:48,281
[SPEAKER_00]: According to Eurogamer, their release is October 21st for the UK.

431
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:48,882
[SPEAKER_02]: Lucky them.

432
00:26:49,042 --> 00:26:52,343
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because November it's not coming out until, I think, second or third week.

433
00:26:52,503 --> 00:26:52,964
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a good thing.

434
00:26:52,984 --> 00:26:53,344
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wait, no, wait.

435
00:26:53,684 --> 00:26:54,044
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm sorry.

436
00:26:54,064 --> 00:26:54,844
[SPEAKER_02]: That was October.

437
00:26:55,325 --> 00:26:56,345
[SPEAKER_02]: We're getting it a week later, though.

438
00:26:57,025 --> 00:27:01,508
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good thing I could care less about Dragon Ball Z. Genji is also coming out, which is actually a game that I have at home.

439
00:27:01,808 --> 00:27:03,228
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did bring a pack and roll earlier.

440
00:27:03,268 --> 00:27:03,869
[SPEAKER_00]: They get it on the 28th.

441
00:27:05,169 --> 00:27:06,690
[SPEAKER_00]: Zenoseca Episode 2, also on the 28th.

442
00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:10,393
[SPEAKER_03]: If you know a place that rents DS games, seriously, rent before you buy on that one.

443
00:27:10,734 --> 00:27:12,815
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's one of those ones you'll love it or you'll not.

444
00:27:14,016 --> 00:27:14,557
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, thank you.

445
00:27:15,257 --> 00:27:15,578
[SPEAKER_03]: You're welcome.

446
00:27:15,598 --> 00:27:15,738
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.

447
00:27:16,598 --> 00:27:25,966
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's move on to, I've got to ask Loki, you know, kind of our hack and crack guy, you know, I don't follow the hack scene so much, but obviously I heard the big news about the 2.0 downgrade.

448
00:27:26,206 --> 00:27:26,686
[SPEAKER_03]: What happened?

449
00:27:27,427 --> 00:27:33,472
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so the people that, you know, found that bug to begin with in the 2.0 downgrade

450
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:39,002
[SPEAKER_02]: Firmware basically be able to launch their own code by doing a buffer overflow.

451
00:27:40,463 --> 00:27:44,884
[SPEAKER_02]: They basically created this program to make the PSP think that's version 1.0.

452
00:27:45,685 --> 00:27:51,787
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when you do that, then you can run the version 1.5 update and basically downgrade your entire PSP.

453
00:27:52,348 --> 00:27:55,069
[SPEAKER_02]: So this method has been posted all over the place.

454
00:27:55,629 --> 00:28:00,031
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it started off at PSPHacks.com is where they originally posted it.

455
00:28:00,451 --> 00:28:00,591
[SPEAKER_02]: And

456
00:28:24,865 --> 00:28:25,867
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless you know where to get them.

457
00:28:25,888 --> 00:28:26,489
[SPEAKER_02]: Not exactly.

458
00:28:26,529 --> 00:28:29,896
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're the one that's in the homebrew site, they do have links to the firmware.

459
00:28:29,936 --> 00:28:33,043
[SPEAKER_02]: They do keep copies on their servers for the Japanese and stuff, so...

460
00:28:33,436 --> 00:28:35,517
[SPEAKER_03]: Not surprised Sony's ticked off about this.

461
00:28:35,877 --> 00:28:38,658
[SPEAKER_03]: Although, you'd think they'd embrace the homebrew thing a little more.

462
00:28:38,718 --> 00:28:40,519
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you'd think they'd take advantage of it.

463
00:28:40,579 --> 00:28:42,360
[SPEAKER_03]: They'd take advantage of it, at least, you know.

464
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:42,840
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

465
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:48,603
[SPEAKER_02]: I was telling my guy that represents H-Tech, I'm like, why aren't they coming out with RPG Maker for the PSP?

466
00:28:48,643 --> 00:28:50,124
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, it'd be freaking sweet.

467
00:28:50,144 --> 00:28:51,864
[SPEAKER_02]: You could put your own textures and stuff in there.

468
00:28:51,884 --> 00:28:53,425
[SPEAKER_02]: You can distribute your games online.

469
00:28:53,885 --> 00:28:55,026
[SPEAKER_02]: It's homebrew, but it's legal.

470
00:28:56,146 --> 00:28:57,227
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, what more would you want?

471
00:28:57,467 --> 00:29:02,289
[SPEAKER_03]: I always found it interesting that in the 2.0 upgrade, there were things like

472
00:29:02,591 --> 00:29:07,354
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember there was the hack a few months ago before 2.0 came out that would allow you to change the background on your PSP?

473
00:29:07,734 --> 00:29:09,355
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they implemented that in 2.0.

474
00:29:09,475 --> 00:29:10,976
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought that was kind of interesting.

475
00:29:11,216 --> 00:29:13,318
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's stuff like that.

476
00:29:13,738 --> 00:29:14,778
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's the thing, though.

477
00:29:14,798 --> 00:29:22,163
[SPEAKER_02]: The other reason is people are only really upgrading to use the web browser, but when you think about it, the web browser is kind of useless anyways.

478
00:29:23,364 --> 00:29:25,265
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless, I mean, you just... I don't know.

479
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:27,226
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not a lot of sites that support it right now, so...

480
00:29:28,556 --> 00:29:38,204
[SPEAKER_02]: and it doesn't support Flash and it's really limited on, it doesn't support Java so it's like, they're teething oh well maybe future firmware updates will implement that.

481
00:29:38,224 --> 00:29:40,706
[SPEAKER_02]: Well thank you for releasing something crippled for us.

482
00:29:40,746 --> 00:29:41,187
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

483
00:29:41,587 --> 00:29:42,268
[SPEAKER_02]: Appreciate it.

484
00:29:42,748 --> 00:29:45,210
[SPEAKER_03]: A good way for them to cover their tracks when this kind of stuff comes up though.

485
00:29:45,851 --> 00:29:55,839
[SPEAKER_02]: But the whole thing is they're working with Homebrew on even the 2.0 and if they get smart enough they're going to figure out how to just rip stuff out of the different updates and put

486
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:58,161
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what's going to happen.

487
00:29:58,181 --> 00:30:02,362
[SPEAKER_02]: And speaking of updates, I have to warn a few people here.

488
00:30:02,982 --> 00:30:17,886
[SPEAKER_02]: There was something going around, actually, that was basically saying it's a patcher that will fix your PSP to, I think, add the browser in there as well.

489
00:30:18,246 --> 00:30:20,487
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's basically this patcher that's been going around.

490
00:30:20,507 --> 00:30:23,848
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know who was releasing it, PSP Team.

491
00:30:25,461 --> 00:30:28,982
[SPEAKER_02]: and it will actually crash your PSP and destroy it.

492
00:30:29,122 --> 00:30:33,023
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's got to be somebody that wants to mess it up for everybody else.

493
00:30:33,064 --> 00:30:33,584
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.

494
00:30:33,764 --> 00:30:38,045
[SPEAKER_02]: So don't download that, but do find the big links for it.

495
00:30:38,665 --> 00:30:39,085
[SPEAKER_02]: It's out there.

496
00:30:39,485 --> 00:30:39,786
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

497
00:30:40,026 --> 00:30:47,988
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, speaking of the PSP, we here at Orange Lounge Radio have a pretty hefty announcement, and I think it's time to mention what it is.

498
00:30:48,148 --> 00:30:51,089
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, what is going on, Orange Lounge Radio PSP-wise?

499
00:30:51,496 --> 00:31:00,980
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, everybody's having the PSP, and those people that do have the 2.0 browser or a web browser out there that they're using on the PSP are looking for more portals and links and stuff like that.

500
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:14,606
[SPEAKER_02]: So we here at Orange Launch Radio decided it's time to get with things, and we like to be innovative and jumped on the whole podcasting thing right when it was kind of getting started here.

501
00:31:15,487 --> 00:31:18,968
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we actually will be announcing the launch of OLRPSP.com

502
00:31:21,916 --> 00:31:23,979
[SPEAKER_02]: which will be our PSP formatted site.

503
00:31:23,999 --> 00:31:28,063
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to find links to download our podcast straight to your PSP.

504
00:31:28,103 --> 00:31:32,608
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to have downloads just like we have a wallpaper on there now that you can download for it.

505
00:31:33,375 --> 00:31:38,678
[SPEAKER_02]: and plus you'll be able to keep up with the news that we have and a lot of other things, just more features.

506
00:31:39,138 --> 00:31:41,239
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's olrpsp.com.

507
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:50,484
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you can visit this on a PC, on your regular Internet Explorer or Firefly, but it's going to look kind of crappy because this site is formatted for your PSP.

508
00:31:50,524 --> 00:31:52,365
[SPEAKER_03]: This is specifically for those folks.

509
00:31:53,525 --> 00:32:00,949
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, it looks kind of okay on a... It's okay, but if you're wondering why it looks all funky, it's because it's specifically for a PSP.

510
00:32:02,108 --> 00:32:03,769
[SPEAKER_00]: That looks pretty good if you have a high-definition screen.

511
00:32:03,989 --> 00:32:04,270
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

512
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:04,710
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

513
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:06,592
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it looks really nice.

514
00:32:07,512 --> 00:32:16,239
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki and VXJasonXV, our tech guy behind the scenes, you guys did an incredible job on this, and I think people are going to love it because I love the way you guys designed the site.

515
00:32:16,259 --> 00:32:21,383
[SPEAKER_03]: You used a lot of image maps in your design, and I think that's a great way to browse on the PSP.

516
00:32:21,443 --> 00:32:23,105
[SPEAKER_03]: So check it out, guys.

517
00:32:23,205 --> 00:32:31,151
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've got my 2.0 PSP that I was actually testing it with right as I'm making it, so make sure that everything worked, that it looked nice.

518
00:32:32,029 --> 00:32:33,269
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just works awesome.

519
00:32:33,309 --> 00:32:36,530
[SPEAKER_02]: And the first wallpaper we have, I have it on my PSP.

520
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:37,250
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks nice.

521
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:40,431
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't detract from the icon so you can see everything.

522
00:32:40,971 --> 00:32:42,711
[SPEAKER_02]: And ironically enough, it worked out that way.

523
00:32:42,771 --> 00:32:44,612
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's just really cool.

524
00:32:44,672 --> 00:32:47,532
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so check that out, olrpsp.com.

525
00:32:47,552 --> 00:32:50,393
[SPEAKER_02]: No www, remember, folks, because otherwise that won't work.

526
00:32:50,873 --> 00:32:51,153
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

527
00:32:51,353 --> 00:32:53,954
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, just olrpsp.com.

528
00:32:54,074 --> 00:32:54,934
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, check that out.

529
00:32:55,598 --> 00:32:57,199
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, moving on.

530
00:32:57,299 --> 00:32:58,499
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go to another story here.

531
00:32:58,519 --> 00:33:00,239
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a story about Disgaea 2.

532
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,680
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of folks are really into the Disgaea.

533
00:33:03,941 --> 00:33:04,681
[SPEAKER_03]: Cute story.

534
00:33:05,101 --> 00:33:08,162
[SPEAKER_03]: It had a very cute story to it and a very interesting game there.

535
00:33:09,102 --> 00:33:14,024
[SPEAKER_03]: Disgaea 2 has been announced in the latest issue of Dengeki PS2.

536
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:15,444
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be out for 2006.

537
00:33:18,245 --> 00:33:25,087
[SPEAKER_03]: So that is going to be what is coming out and the Etna, Devil Girl Etna

538
00:33:25,823 --> 00:33:31,105
[SPEAKER_03]: and the Prinies, the little penguin guys, they will be coming back in the next Disgaea as well.

539
00:33:32,085 --> 00:33:42,869
[SPEAKER_03]: Some cameos as well of characters from Makai Kingdom, which was another game in that same series, I believe, or at least from the same developer.

540
00:33:42,909 --> 00:33:43,749
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's the same series.

541
00:33:46,010 --> 00:33:46,350
[SPEAKER_00]: What game?

542
00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:47,970
[SPEAKER_03]: Not La Pucelle.

543
00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:48,851
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a different game.

544
00:33:49,391 --> 00:33:50,511
[SPEAKER_00]: No, Makai Tenshou?

545
00:33:50,571 --> 00:33:51,792
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Makai Kingdom.

546
00:33:52,312 --> 00:33:52,972
[SPEAKER_03]: Here, yeah.

547
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:54,880
[SPEAKER_03]: So check that out there.

548
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:58,801
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be a very similar game with the combo system and everything is coming back.

549
00:33:58,881 --> 00:33:59,961
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's Disgaea 2.

550
00:34:02,302 --> 00:34:04,943
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go on to, I think what we should do now.

551
00:34:05,303 --> 00:34:08,524
[SPEAKER_03]: We've talked an awful lot about a lot of games so far, haven't we?

552
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:09,364
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

553
00:34:09,404 --> 00:34:14,065
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think what we need to do, we need to talk about some real life things.

554
00:34:14,405 --> 00:34:22,707
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, we here at Orange Lounge Radio, we can't play video games all day long because if we played video games all day long, we'd have no time to design websites.

555
00:34:23,715 --> 00:34:31,776
[SPEAKER_03]: So, DarkSakura is here to remind you guys there's a whole world out there, and she would like to give you some advice to help you survive in the world.

556
00:34:31,816 --> 00:34:35,437
[SPEAKER_03]: So, DarkSakura, what are you going to talk to the kids about tonight?

557
00:34:36,457 --> 00:34:39,258
[SPEAKER_00]: Today's bit of advice is how to survive a bird attack.

558
00:34:40,638 --> 00:34:41,658
[SPEAKER_03]: Like in the Hitchcock movie?

559
00:34:41,698 --> 00:34:42,118
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

560
00:34:42,158 --> 00:34:42,418
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

561
00:34:43,378 --> 00:34:46,279
[SPEAKER_00]: There's even, I even have a picture that looks like it's from the birds.

562
00:34:46,979 --> 00:34:49,460
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one, watch for hovering and clacking.

563
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:51,740
[SPEAKER_00]: If you observe this behavior, be ready for an attack.

564
00:34:52,429 --> 00:34:54,170
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't wander on to the set of Hitchcock remakes.

565
00:35:21,969 --> 00:35:23,049
[SPEAKER_02]: And also they're birds.

566
00:35:23,149 --> 00:35:23,870
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, come on.

567
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:25,450
[SPEAKER_02]: You should be able to fight off birds.

568
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:26,330
[SPEAKER_02]: They're small.

569
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:29,131
[SPEAKER_03]: When they say don't feed the pigeons, they effing mean it.

570
00:35:29,171 --> 00:35:30,132
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a bird.

571
00:35:30,172 --> 00:35:33,113
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like a giant duck or goose or something.

572
00:35:33,173 --> 00:35:36,854
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if you have like a flock of geese or something that are... A flock of seagulls.

573
00:35:37,574 --> 00:35:39,555
[SPEAKER_02]: Or a flock of... Well, seagulls are just pathetic.

574
00:35:39,595 --> 00:35:42,255
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they'll drop dead when you give them, you know, Alka-Seltzer.

575
00:35:42,275 --> 00:35:44,136
[SPEAKER_02]: But seriously, I mean, they're birds.

576
00:35:44,216 --> 00:35:45,456
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you should be able to fight off birds.

577
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:47,537
[SPEAKER_03]: I was attacked by a flock of seagulls once, and you know what?

578
00:35:48,117 --> 00:35:48,517
[SPEAKER_03]: I ran.

579
00:35:48,978 --> 00:35:50,218
[SPEAKER_03]: I ran so far away.

580
00:35:50,238 --> 00:35:50,438
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey.

581
00:35:51,963 --> 00:35:53,004
[SPEAKER_00]: Did it give you bad hair?

582
00:35:53,224 --> 00:36:00,490
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, you've got a story about the Nintendo Wi-Fi DS system that's coming up, and I'm really excited about this.

583
00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:03,712
[SPEAKER_03]: I am so excited about the DS Wi-Fi.

584
00:36:03,812 --> 00:36:10,117
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope this isn't just one of those things that's a good theory on paper, but I really hope Nintendo doesn't let me down on this.

585
00:36:10,137 --> 00:36:11,358
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is going to be bigger than I thought.

586
00:36:11,458 --> 00:36:15,801
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought this was just going to be Animal Crossing and Mario Kart, but not the case.

587
00:36:16,242 --> 00:36:18,103
[SPEAKER_02]: No, they have a lot of things announced for it, actually.

588
00:36:18,844 --> 00:36:21,686
[SPEAKER_02]: The Nintendo Wi-Fi site actually launched

589
00:36:22,731 --> 00:36:24,891
[SPEAKER_02]: By launch, they mean there's a teaser page there now.

590
00:36:25,712 --> 00:36:39,874
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically, if you go to NintendoWiFi.com and you check it out, their wonderful logo for it, the games that they're saying that are going to be utilizing the Wi-Fi, they have a huge list here.

591
00:36:40,434 --> 00:36:41,474
[SPEAKER_02]: This is only partial, too.

592
00:36:41,714 --> 00:36:48,255
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, of course, Animal Crossing, Bomberman, which I was surprised, and I'm assuming that's the Bomberman that came out already.

593
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:49,616
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe there's another one.

594
00:36:49,656 --> 00:36:49,956
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

595
00:36:49,976 --> 00:36:50,796
[SPEAKER_02]: There might be another one.

596
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:51,976
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't heard of one, but

597
00:36:52,869 --> 00:36:57,753
[SPEAKER_02]: Castlevania at DS, which that's coming out in a couple of days here.

598
00:36:58,954 --> 00:37:03,698
[SPEAKER_02]: We have Contact, which I hope is not a game based on the really crappy movie.

599
00:37:03,758 --> 00:37:04,538
[SPEAKER_03]: I somehow doubt it.

600
00:37:05,479 --> 00:37:09,482
[SPEAKER_02]: Digimon World, of course, they'll probably make a DS version.

601
00:37:10,743 --> 00:37:14,526
[SPEAKER_02]: Dynasty Warriors DS, which I heard was actually pushed back to who knows when.

602
00:37:15,247 --> 00:37:16,027
[SPEAKER_02]: Some really good ones.

603
00:37:16,427 --> 00:37:18,929
[SPEAKER_02]: Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles DS, which is pretty cool.

604
00:37:18,989 --> 00:37:20,250
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope that's playable.

605
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:21,391
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be great.

606
00:37:22,711 --> 00:37:24,472
[SPEAKER_02]: Mario Kart DS, of course, no surprise.

607
00:37:24,532 --> 00:37:26,933
[SPEAKER_02]: Metroid Prime Hunters, which isn't even coming out until next year.

608
00:37:28,714 --> 00:37:29,594
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see here.

609
00:37:30,034 --> 00:37:32,956
[SPEAKER_02]: Super Monkey Ball DS, which whoop-a-dee-doo.

610
00:37:33,576 --> 00:37:40,560
[SPEAKER_02]: Tony Hawk's American Skateland, which is the DS version of American Wasteland, but they did their own specific version for it.

611
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:43,641
[SPEAKER_02]: Top Spin 2, Tenchu DS.

612
00:37:44,481 --> 00:37:47,023
[SPEAKER_02]: Then they have some generic card games.

613
00:37:47,043 --> 00:37:49,524
[SPEAKER_02]: They have Ultimate Card Games and Ultimate Brain Games.

614
00:37:49,624 --> 00:37:51,105
[SPEAKER_02]: And then World Soccer Winnie-11 DS.

615
00:37:53,002 --> 00:37:58,505
[SPEAKER_00]: For the record, Contact is by Goichi Suda, who is the director of Capcom's Killer7.

616
00:37:59,606 --> 00:38:00,546
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's that game.

617
00:38:01,407 --> 00:38:03,128
[SPEAKER_03]: That's weird.

618
00:38:03,168 --> 00:38:04,228
[SPEAKER_00]: So it shouldn't suck.

619
00:38:05,029 --> 00:38:05,229
[SPEAKER_03]: Good.

620
00:38:06,089 --> 00:38:06,789
[SPEAKER_03]: No Jodie Foster.

621
00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:11,212
[SPEAKER_02]: This isn't launching until November, but hey, that's when Mario Kart's coming out.

622
00:38:11,232 --> 00:38:11,852
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty exciting.

623
00:38:11,892 --> 00:38:13,753
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the website for that, the teaser site?

624
00:38:13,893 --> 00:38:14,674
[SPEAKER_02]: Nintendo.com?

625
00:38:14,694 --> 00:38:15,634
[SPEAKER_03]: NintendoWiFi.com.

626
00:38:15,674 --> 00:38:16,695
[SPEAKER_03]: NintendoWiFi.com.

627
00:38:16,955 --> 00:38:17,275
[SPEAKER_03]: Check it out.

628
00:38:18,328 --> 00:38:19,269
[SPEAKER_03]: Grandma's Boy

629
00:38:34,097 --> 00:38:36,098
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay, yeah, yeah, Grandma's Boy was the one I had.

630
00:38:36,138 --> 00:38:37,779
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't even realize the trailer was out already.

631
00:38:38,499 --> 00:38:41,221
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a brand new Adam Sandler movie that's coming out now.

632
00:38:41,301 --> 00:38:44,122
[SPEAKER_03]: Why would we care here on a video game show about an Adam Sandler movie?

633
00:38:44,462 --> 00:38:50,385
[SPEAKER_03]: Because in the film, Grandma's Boy, he plays a 36-year-old game tester and aspiring developer.

634
00:38:51,486 --> 00:38:55,528
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's about, oh, it's about Adam Sandler stuff, you know.

635
00:38:56,048 --> 00:38:56,608
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funny.

636
00:38:56,748 --> 00:38:58,049
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got the mom from...

637
00:38:58,942 --> 00:39:00,283
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody Loves Raymond in it.

638
00:39:29,938 --> 00:39:30,679
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, here's another one.

639
00:39:30,699 --> 00:39:33,361
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a little more serious of a game adaptation.

640
00:39:34,061 --> 00:39:40,185
[SPEAKER_03]: Siren is going to be made into a live action film in Japan.

641
00:39:41,065 --> 00:39:51,071
[SPEAKER_03]: And let's see, the film is going to be directed by Sada Yoshihiko, who made Trick and Kizoku.

642
00:39:51,612 --> 00:39:52,392
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope I pronounced that right.

643
00:39:53,092 --> 00:39:58,976
[SPEAKER_03]: He's writing a treatment right now that's supposed to come out about February 11th when Siren 2 comes out as well.

644
00:39:59,777 --> 00:40:03,799
[SPEAKER_03]: So it is being plotted right now to come out, a Siren video game.

645
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:07,902
[SPEAKER_02]: Another franchise is getting their own movie pretty soon.

646
00:40:09,162 --> 00:40:11,584
[SPEAKER_02]: God of War is being worked on right now.

647
00:40:11,704 --> 00:40:12,845
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not a surprise.

648
00:40:13,205 --> 00:40:18,228
[SPEAKER_02]: Adaptation, but you know they're going to cast Vin Diesel or The Rock for it.

649
00:40:18,768 --> 00:40:25,031
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I saw finally on the big screen for the first time was that trailer for Doom, which I hadn't seen yet.

650
00:40:25,171 --> 00:40:25,372
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

651
00:40:25,572 --> 00:40:25,912
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

652
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:30,216
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, that first person thing, look hokey.

653
00:40:30,896 --> 00:40:32,998
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to use that way too much.

654
00:40:33,098 --> 00:40:39,462
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I can understand, let's do that sequence for like maybe 30 seconds of the movies to kind of throw back to the, you know.

655
00:40:39,482 --> 00:40:41,124
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you know what that reminds me of?

656
00:40:41,444 --> 00:40:47,388
[SPEAKER_03]: It reminds me of, what was the, not House of the Dead, I think it was, where they had the gun.

657
00:40:47,408 --> 00:40:49,409
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that what it is?

658
00:40:49,470 --> 00:40:53,172
[SPEAKER_02]: House of the Dead, yeah, where they threw in actual shots from the game.

659
00:40:53,212 --> 00:40:54,533
[SPEAKER_00]: Worst zombie movie ever.

660
00:40:54,553 --> 00:40:55,454
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, thank you.

661
00:40:57,025 --> 00:40:58,666
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you hear about the PlayStation?

662
00:40:59,446 --> 00:40:59,626
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

663
00:40:59,646 --> 00:41:00,427
[SPEAKER_03]: What's going on with the PlayStation?

664
00:41:00,587 --> 00:41:01,227
[SPEAKER_00]: They won an Emmy.

665
00:41:01,567 --> 00:41:02,108
[SPEAKER_03]: An Emmy?

666
00:41:02,328 --> 00:41:02,608
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.

667
00:41:02,908 --> 00:41:05,369
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it one of those things that Ellen gave out on the awards?

668
00:41:05,389 --> 00:41:06,790
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I don't remember hearing about that.

669
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:14,313
[SPEAKER_00]: Ten years to the day after the original PlayStation went on sale in North America, the console has been awarded an Emmy for...

670
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:18,741
[SPEAKER_00]: Outstanding Achievement in Technology and Advanced New Media.

671
00:41:19,881 --> 00:41:22,622
[SPEAKER_03]: So that must have been at one of those tech awards.

672
00:41:22,642 --> 00:41:25,442
[SPEAKER_03]: You know how they always do the tech awards that aren't good enough for TV?

673
00:41:25,582 --> 00:41:27,403
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the Oscars and the Emmys do that?

674
00:41:27,723 --> 00:41:31,123
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the 57th Annual Technology and Engineering Emmy Awards.

675
00:41:32,084 --> 00:41:33,504
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not all that they've won.

676
00:41:34,304 --> 00:41:35,124
[SPEAKER_02]: What else did they win?

677
00:41:35,444 --> 00:41:39,605
[SPEAKER_02]: They've won... Banishment from the Vatican.

678
00:41:40,705 --> 00:41:42,066
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if I'd consider that winning.

679
00:41:42,386 --> 00:41:43,386
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but basically...

680
00:41:44,423 --> 00:41:53,306
[SPEAKER_02]: Sony Italy has recently put up a full-page advertisement depicting some guy wearing a crown of thorns, much like Jesus.

681
00:41:54,026 --> 00:41:57,207
[SPEAKER_03]: Except this guy has no beard and no mustache, right?

682
00:41:57,227 --> 00:42:00,709
[SPEAKER_02]: Except this guy looks like he's a, I don't know, some... A nerd?

683
00:42:00,989 --> 00:42:02,649
[SPEAKER_02]: Some, yeah, nerd reject or whatever.

684
00:42:02,669 --> 00:42:10,352
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, and he has a crown of thorns made up of the PlayStation symbols, you know, the X, circle, square, triangle stuff, and

685
00:42:11,151 --> 00:42:16,772
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the subtitle to the whole article, which I love this, Ten Years of Passion.

686
00:42:18,413 --> 00:42:19,453
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my gosh.

687
00:42:20,373 --> 00:42:20,813
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

688
00:42:22,214 --> 00:42:23,594
[SPEAKER_03]: How did that get by?

689
00:42:23,614 --> 00:42:25,755
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it did.

690
00:42:26,315 --> 00:42:27,775
[SPEAKER_00]: The Vatican took exception.

691
00:42:29,856 --> 00:42:31,676
[SPEAKER_03]: How did that get by at Sony, though?

692
00:42:31,696 --> 00:42:34,737
[SPEAKER_00]: So is the entirety of Sega Corporate X communicated now?

693
00:42:34,877 --> 00:42:35,217
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

694
00:42:35,517 --> 00:42:38,698
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they've actually had it pulled out of the Vatican.

695
00:42:38,738 --> 00:42:39,138
[SPEAKER_02]: You think?

696
00:42:39,622 --> 00:42:41,483
[SPEAKER_02]: They executed their Vatican powers.

697
00:42:41,803 --> 00:42:42,184
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

698
00:42:43,805 --> 00:42:44,405
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on.

699
00:42:44,465 --> 00:42:47,287
[SPEAKER_03]: We promised earlier in the show we'd get to some more of your e-mails.

700
00:42:47,507 --> 00:42:52,750
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you have an e-mail for us, you can always send us one at togo, T-O-G-O, at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

701
00:42:53,331 --> 00:42:58,494
[SPEAKER_03]: And DarkSakura is going to rip open the mailbag violently and salvage some letters to read on air.

702
00:42:58,514 --> 00:43:01,156
[SPEAKER_00]: Smash, smash, rip, tear.

703
00:43:01,196 --> 00:43:03,477
[SPEAKER_00]: 16Bit sent us an e-mail, actually.

704
00:43:03,717 --> 00:43:04,218
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome name.

705
00:43:05,158 --> 00:43:09,041
[SPEAKER_00]: A correction about Panorama Cotton stating that it's just fairly uncommon.

706
00:43:09,944 --> 00:43:11,104
[SPEAKER_00]: and there were several thousand.

707
00:43:11,145 --> 00:43:15,766
[SPEAKER_00]: I tend to exaggerate with that game because I've had no luck finding a copy for less than $500.

708
00:43:15,966 --> 00:43:18,947
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm impressed somebody out there actually knew what the game was.

709
00:43:19,027 --> 00:43:20,008
[SPEAKER_03]: I sure as hell never heard of it.

710
00:43:20,068 --> 00:43:21,368
[SPEAKER_00]: Panorama Cotton is fun.

711
00:43:21,428 --> 00:43:22,029
[SPEAKER_03]: I never heard of it.

712
00:43:22,289 --> 00:43:25,190
[SPEAKER_00]: Although it actually does give me sort of motion sickness.

713
00:43:26,190 --> 00:43:30,952
[SPEAKER_00]: And Rainbow Cotton didn't, which is really weird because usually it has to be the 3D game that makes me motion sick.

714
00:43:32,207 --> 00:43:36,071
[SPEAKER_03]: While we're on the subject of corrections, I actually have to correct something too, because I got an email about that.

715
00:43:37,072 --> 00:43:37,332
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

716
00:43:37,692 --> 00:43:47,261
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Ranma S wants to know that the Miyamoto meet, which we talked about last week, the article that I was referencing talked about that it was going to be the first ten people.

717
00:43:48,019 --> 00:43:50,200
[SPEAKER_03]: would get to do Bark Mode with Miyamoto's dog.

718
00:43:50,520 --> 00:44:06,904
[SPEAKER_03]: But unfortunately, if you think about the way Bark Mode works, there's no way you can restrict that to just being the first ten people in line that are going to be able to do it, because Bark Mode is going to pick up on any DS that's within 100 feet, so really it ended up being anybody that could get to Miyamoto's dog got to do Bark Mode with Miyamoto's dog.

719
00:44:07,385 --> 00:44:13,026
[SPEAKER_03]: And so a lot of people outside actually ended up getting Miyamoto on their friends list, which I think is just awesome.

720
00:44:13,486 --> 00:44:15,787
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, DJ Ranma S, for sending in that correction.

721
00:44:17,281 --> 00:44:22,944
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, one of our Canadian friends, Aceman, sent a question.

722
00:44:23,524 --> 00:44:29,267
[SPEAKER_00]: Said, I'm thinking about getting the 360 when it comes out on launch, but the thing is I don't know about the game selection.

723
00:44:30,087 --> 00:44:33,809
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I know which ones I'm going to get for myself, Gears of War and Dead Rising.

724
00:44:33,829 --> 00:44:40,232
[SPEAKER_00]: My question is, are there any four-player co-op games offline that you guys know of that I should pick up other than Ghost Recon?

725
00:44:41,641 --> 00:44:48,704
[SPEAKER_02]: First off, I'd like to mention you might think of some better games to pick because Dead Rising and Gears of War are not coming out of launch, unfortunately.

726
00:44:48,864 --> 00:44:49,465
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, ouch.

727
00:44:49,845 --> 00:44:52,706
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Gears of War is to be announced right now.

728
00:44:52,746 --> 00:44:55,007
[SPEAKER_02]: Dead Rising has never even been on launch.

729
00:44:56,608 --> 00:44:59,249
[SPEAKER_02]: However, you've got a good selection of sports games.

730
00:44:59,309 --> 00:45:04,191
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're a sports fan, you have the entire 2K series and the EA series, you know, their games.

731
00:45:04,551 --> 00:45:08,352
[SPEAKER_00]: If I may, I actually have the full list of launch titles in alphabetical order.

732
00:45:08,653 --> 00:45:09,293
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, go for it.

733
00:45:09,998 --> 00:45:13,459
[SPEAKER_00]: Amped 3, Call of Duty, Condemned, which is Sega.

734
00:45:13,479 --> 00:45:14,280
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking forward to that.

735
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:21,722
[SPEAKER_00]: Dead or Alive 4, Elder Scrolls 4, Final Fantasy XI, Full Auto.

736
00:45:21,902 --> 00:45:23,343
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Final Fantasy XI is a launch title?

737
00:45:23,383 --> 00:45:24,583
[SPEAKER_03]: They are not launch titles.

738
00:45:24,603 --> 00:45:25,643
[SPEAKER_02]: That list is wrong.

739
00:45:25,663 --> 00:45:25,803
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

740
00:45:26,084 --> 00:45:29,545
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm still going to read the list because these are either launch or near launch.

741
00:45:30,745 --> 00:45:37,287
[SPEAKER_00]: Full Auto, Ghost Recon, Advanced Warfighter, Gun, Cameo, Elements of Power, Madden NFL is...

742
00:45:39,424 --> 00:45:53,205
[SPEAKER_00]: NBA 2K6, NHL 2K6, blah blah The Outfit, Perfect Dark, Project Gotham Racing 3, Quake 4, Ridge Racer 6 Saints Row, Tony Hawk's American Wasteland, Top Spin 2

743
00:45:54,629 --> 00:45:59,514
[SPEAKER_00]: Second wave of launch titles announced by EB as of November 16th.

744
00:45:59,874 --> 00:46:05,059
[SPEAKER_00]: Burnout Revenge, FIFA Soccer 06, Peter Jackson's King Kong.

745
00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:12,746
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way, speaking of that, they showed a scene of King Kong to the GameStop managers and it apparently is supposed to be very awesome.

746
00:46:13,828 --> 00:46:17,911
[SPEAKER_00]: NBA Live 06, Need for Speed Most Wanted, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 06.

747
00:46:19,752 --> 00:46:21,093
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect Dark, isn't that a four-player?

748
00:46:21,333 --> 00:46:23,313
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me correct that list real quick here.

749
00:46:23,353 --> 00:46:28,574
[SPEAKER_02]: King Kong is coming day and date with the PlayStation 2, Xbox versions, and GameCube versions.

750
00:46:28,694 --> 00:46:31,375
[SPEAKER_02]: It's launching on every single platform the same day.

751
00:46:33,276 --> 00:46:34,156
[SPEAKER_02]: What else we have here?

752
00:46:35,076 --> 00:46:40,597
[SPEAKER_02]: There was... I know Frame City Killer got pushed back to February, which was one I was looking for.

753
00:46:40,777 --> 00:46:42,758
[SPEAKER_02]: I know Saints Row isn't coming out until next year.

754
00:46:44,418 --> 00:46:47,359
[SPEAKER_02]: Full Auto's not coming out next year, and I'm really disappointed about that, but...

755
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:52,042
[SPEAKER_02]: The ones I was definitely going to pick up, Quake 4 looks good.

756
00:46:52,862 --> 00:46:56,363
[SPEAKER_02]: Project Gotham Racing 3 is going to be friggin' awesome.

757
00:46:56,403 --> 00:47:00,605
[SPEAKER_02]: Need for Speed, most wanted, is coming out the week before launch.

758
00:47:01,065 --> 00:47:04,987
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a November 19th release date for Frame City Killer by Namco.

759
00:47:05,476 --> 00:47:07,498
[SPEAKER_02]: I got pushed back last week to February.

760
00:47:09,059 --> 00:47:15,364
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also an initial price list from EB that all the games will be $59.99, except for Cameo, which is listed at $49.99.

761
00:47:16,065 --> 00:47:19,367
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some other ones that are $49.99, but yeah, Cameo is one of the cheaper ones.

762
00:47:19,588 --> 00:47:28,355
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking forward to Quake 4 and DOA 4, which is weird because I'm usually not into DOA, but for some reason, I'm looking really forward to this new one.

763
00:47:28,375 --> 00:47:29,916
[SPEAKER_00]: EB listed Halo 3 as being July 1, 2006.

764
00:47:32,498 --> 00:47:34,780
[SPEAKER_02]: They haven't even announced anything yet.

765
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:38,503
[SPEAKER_00]: They're stating that they're presuming it to be the same day as the PS3 release.

766
00:47:38,723 --> 00:47:39,084
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

767
00:47:39,424 --> 00:47:40,425
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah.

768
00:47:40,685 --> 00:47:41,426
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got to keep it moving.

769
00:47:41,466 --> 00:47:42,787
[SPEAKER_03]: So any other emails, DarkSakura?

770
00:47:42,967 --> 00:47:43,127
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope.

771
00:47:43,548 --> 00:47:43,788
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

772
00:47:43,828 --> 00:47:45,709
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to close the mailbag until next week.

773
00:47:45,749 --> 00:47:48,572
[SPEAKER_03]: So send us some emails to go at orangelaunchradio.com.

774
00:47:49,662 --> 00:47:53,043
[SPEAKER_03]: Castlevania will be going next-gen.

775
00:47:53,203 --> 00:47:54,784
[SPEAKER_03]: It's already in development.

776
00:47:55,484 --> 00:48:00,786
[SPEAKER_03]: Koji Igarashi has confirmed that the next-gen entry, it will happen.

777
00:48:01,446 --> 00:48:03,826
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, it shouldn't be a surprise to anybody.

778
00:48:03,866 --> 00:48:05,527
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one of Konami's most successful series.

779
00:48:06,167 --> 00:48:12,669
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, one thing that you might have been curious about is that the handheld releases, it will continue to depict a different timeline.

780
00:48:12,709 --> 00:48:15,170
[SPEAKER_03]: So the handheld releases will still be a little bit different.

781
00:48:15,830 --> 00:48:17,091
[SPEAKER_03]: Curse of Darkness, I think I...

782
00:48:18,513 --> 00:48:19,274
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

783
00:48:39,059 --> 00:48:40,600
[SPEAKER_03]: Grand Theft Auto and a Grand Theft Auto-like game

784
00:49:03,837 --> 00:49:10,701
[SPEAKER_02]: First off, everybody's been waiting for the Grand Theft Auto Liberty City stories, which is going to be coming out for the PSP at the end of October.

785
00:49:11,662 --> 00:49:18,086
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the things that I, especially I, have been wondering is, you know, are they going to have some support for Wi-Fi?

786
00:49:18,106 --> 00:49:19,386
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we haven't really heard anything.

787
00:49:19,466 --> 00:49:21,067
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the answer is yes, they are.

788
00:49:21,808 --> 00:49:27,611
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll actually feature a few different modes, multiplayer for up to six different players.

789
00:49:28,012 --> 00:49:29,853
[SPEAKER_02]: And it will basically have...

790
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:32,709
[SPEAKER_02]: 2 that have been released so far.

791
00:49:32,769 --> 00:49:34,050
[SPEAKER_02]: They said about 7 modes.

792
00:49:34,530 --> 00:49:50,460
[SPEAKER_02]: The first one being Liberty City Survivor, which is your basic deathmatch style gameplay, and Protection Racket, which splits players into teams, which they must protect or destroy a number of different limousines at bases somewhere in the city.

793
00:49:51,120 --> 00:50:00,366
[SPEAKER_02]: They're basically saying that multiplayer mode will be identical to single player, but you'll have more vehicles available up front and 60 different player skins.

794
00:50:01,658 --> 00:50:02,338
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

795
00:50:02,378 --> 00:50:05,719
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus, of course, power-ups and standard hoo-ha there.

796
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:27,026
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, of course, Microsoft can't be out of any sort of franchise, so their supposed answer to the Grand Theft Auto series is a game which, I don't know, it looks okay, but it's basically a Grand Theft Auto-ish type game with kind of a superhero character.

797
00:50:27,086 --> 00:50:27,946
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Crackdown.

798
00:50:28,436 --> 00:50:57,949
[SPEAKER_02]: and you're basically a superhuman guy who can who's basically cleaning up the city and by cleaning up the city you can steal cars throw cars at people just really interesting stuff I don't know it doesn't look that great to me the screenshots I saw I was like who gives a crap you know I'll pick it up because it'll be fun to play I like throwing cars at people but it doesn't look that impressive I mean especially looking at the other games coming out it just

799
00:50:59,085 --> 00:51:00,687
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like a third-party release.

800
00:51:00,767 --> 00:51:01,767
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just not really good.

801
00:51:02,828 --> 00:51:04,670
[SPEAKER_02]: But, hey, beta shots, who knows?

802
00:51:05,391 --> 00:51:06,472
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows?

803
00:51:06,532 --> 00:51:07,753
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a couple more stories, then.

804
00:51:08,173 --> 00:51:09,755
[SPEAKER_03]: We got just a couple more here.

805
00:51:09,935 --> 00:51:11,736
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing I want to talk about is the Mana series.

806
00:51:12,077 --> 00:51:14,539
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, you know, Secret of Mana, Legend of Mana, all that stuff.

807
00:51:15,239 --> 00:51:16,561
[SPEAKER_03]: We have Children of Mana.

808
00:51:16,641 --> 00:51:18,682
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually an RPG that's in development right now.

809
00:51:18,702 --> 00:51:20,424
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be coming out for the Nintendo DS.

810
00:51:21,105 --> 00:51:24,428
[SPEAKER_03]: That was confirmed in Famitsu Weekly Magazine this week.

811
00:51:25,188 --> 00:51:25,849
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't know how it's...

812
00:51:26,536 --> 00:51:29,098
[SPEAKER_03]: Take advantage of having the two screens and the touch thing.

813
00:51:29,398 --> 00:51:30,679
[SPEAKER_03]: All we know is that it's happening.

814
00:51:30,739 --> 00:51:31,399
[SPEAKER_03]: Children of Mana.

815
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:36,623
[SPEAKER_03]: I just hope it's better than Legend of Mana because I could not... Legend of Mana ruined the series for me.

816
00:51:36,803 --> 00:51:37,503
[SPEAKER_03]: I couldn't stand it.

817
00:51:37,584 --> 00:51:39,005
[SPEAKER_03]: That PlayStation one was awful.

818
00:51:39,145 --> 00:51:44,428
[SPEAKER_00]: My problem with Legend of Mana was the fact that I imported it in a fit of... Ooh, Mana game!

819
00:51:44,748 --> 00:51:46,830
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to make this bold statement.

820
00:51:46,850 --> 00:51:47,670
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll probably get hate mail for it.

821
00:51:47,690 --> 00:51:48,811
[SPEAKER_00]: It was uber text heavy.

822
00:51:49,131 --> 00:51:51,393
[SPEAKER_03]: I liked Secret of Evermore more than I liked...

823
00:51:51,846 --> 00:51:52,447
[SPEAKER_03]: Legend of Mana

824
00:52:16,511 --> 00:52:22,472
[SPEAKER_03]: Neither one of these games, I should point out, is World of Mana, which was that thing they teased at E3 this year, like a big movie.

825
00:52:23,252 --> 00:52:24,433
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows what the heck that is?

826
00:52:24,713 --> 00:52:27,653
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a hunch it's an MMO, but I could be wrong.

827
00:52:27,793 --> 00:52:28,253
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's an MMO.

828
00:52:28,273 --> 00:52:32,194
[SPEAKER_03]: I think when you call something world, I have a hunch it's an MMO, but we don't know.

829
00:52:32,234 --> 00:52:33,274
[SPEAKER_03]: We just don't know.

830
00:52:34,395 --> 00:52:35,495
[SPEAKER_03]: Last story tonight, guys.

831
00:52:37,855 --> 00:52:45,257
[SPEAKER_03]: Katamari Craze is spreading the nation, of course, and if you want to check out Namco's website, katamari.namco.com,

832
00:52:46,499 --> 00:52:57,566
[SPEAKER_03]: If you sign up for the website, you can actually download your own little version of the prince who will roll a katamari across your screen at various intervals and will play little looping music.

833
00:52:58,106 --> 00:53:01,968
[SPEAKER_03]: And, of course, you can actually click and drag him and throw him places and all that stuff.

834
00:53:02,208 --> 00:53:03,969
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to have a goat that did that.

835
00:53:04,950 --> 00:53:10,553
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess this would be fun for about five minutes and then get as annoying as those little purple bonsai buddies.

836
00:53:10,633 --> 00:53:11,814
[SPEAKER_03]: Thirty seconds, actually.

837
00:53:11,874 --> 00:53:12,134
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

838
00:53:12,594 --> 00:53:13,295
[SPEAKER_02]: Thirty seconds.

839
00:53:13,515 --> 00:53:14,115
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you try this?

840
00:53:14,175 --> 00:53:14,696
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I did.

841
00:53:14,796 --> 00:53:15,236
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was

842
00:53:15,669 --> 00:53:24,591
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like, it replays the whole thing, just over and over, and he just rolls the thing all over the screen, basically back and forth, back and forth, back and forth.

843
00:53:24,631 --> 00:53:25,771
[SPEAKER_02]: Does he pick up your windows?

844
00:53:26,171 --> 00:53:34,933
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought he would, and I thought that would have been awesome, because I have a lot of icons he could roll up, but he did not, and it was a great disappointment.

845
00:53:35,813 --> 00:53:39,194
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll just have to send a message to the King of Cosmos for somebody to...

846
00:53:39,987 --> 00:53:42,509
[SPEAKER_03]: Shoot some frickin' laser beams out of their eyes at Namco.

847
00:53:42,629 --> 00:53:42,969
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

848
00:53:43,509 --> 00:53:45,410
[SPEAKER_00]: That just makes me really miss the little goat.

849
00:53:45,851 --> 00:53:46,091
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

850
00:53:46,731 --> 00:53:48,993
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the little goat would occasionally run off to go see Loki.

851
00:53:49,013 --> 00:53:50,494
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a few last-minute stories here.

852
00:53:50,514 --> 00:53:50,894
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, what's up?

853
00:53:51,174 --> 00:53:51,754
[SPEAKER_02]: A couple ones.

854
00:53:52,395 --> 00:53:54,076
[SPEAKER_02]: First off, there's going to be a new Resident Evil.

855
00:53:54,116 --> 00:53:55,937
[SPEAKER_02]: This one's coming out for the DS, actually.

856
00:53:56,557 --> 00:53:57,758
[SPEAKER_02]: Resident Evil Deadly Science.

857
00:53:57,938 --> 00:53:58,238
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh-huh.

858
00:53:59,839 --> 00:54:00,199
[SPEAKER_03]: DS.

859
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:01,400
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my gosh.

860
00:54:01,420 --> 00:54:01,780
[SPEAKER_03]: Deadly Science.

861
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:04,202
[SPEAKER_03]: You people and naming your franchises...

862
00:54:04,824 --> 00:54:07,085
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything that will work with the DS acronym.

863
00:54:07,366 --> 00:54:10,868
[SPEAKER_02]: So, basically, Resident Evil 4 DS, nothing more to see here, move along.

864
00:54:10,968 --> 00:54:23,895
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, the other thing is, in November, they're going to be bundling the Red DS with Mario Kart for the price of $149, much like you have seen with the Nintendogs.

865
00:54:24,395 --> 00:54:27,257
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yippee, skippee.

866
00:54:27,517 --> 00:54:29,578
[SPEAKER_00]: The Red DS is already available for import.

867
00:54:30,219 --> 00:54:31,479
[SPEAKER_02]: Some info about Zelda...

868
00:54:32,819 --> 00:54:36,381
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, you know how Twilight Princess was supposed to be coming out this year?

869
00:54:36,421 --> 00:54:37,361
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and it's not.

870
00:54:38,042 --> 00:54:39,422
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're adding new features.

871
00:54:39,502 --> 00:54:40,963
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know what those features are?

872
00:54:41,483 --> 00:54:45,685
[SPEAKER_02]: It's basically going to be enhanced for the Nintendo Revolution.

873
00:54:46,126 --> 00:54:54,150
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to be adding, if you plug in your GameCube game to the Revolution, you'll be able to use the wonderful Revolution controller for God knows what.

874
00:54:54,230 --> 00:54:56,811
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's basically why it's been pushed back.

875
00:54:58,092 --> 00:55:00,713
[SPEAKER_02]: I was hoping they would put it on the Nintendo system, but...

876
00:55:01,089 --> 00:55:02,529
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not.

877
00:55:02,609 --> 00:55:04,150
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, they should have just done it for the revolution.

878
00:55:04,190 --> 00:55:07,451
[SPEAKER_00]: The best description of that controller is on VG Cats.

879
00:55:08,671 --> 00:55:09,051
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that?

880
00:55:10,272 --> 00:55:12,272
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, the reaction is, I feel dirty.

881
00:55:13,413 --> 00:55:15,513
[SPEAKER_02]: And the last story... You promise?

882
00:55:16,454 --> 00:55:16,954
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just kidding.

883
00:55:16,994 --> 00:55:17,554
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, what's up?

884
00:55:18,294 --> 00:55:18,954
[SPEAKER_02]: I promise.

885
00:55:19,535 --> 00:55:27,417
[SPEAKER_02]: Last story is, Kojima clarifies that the No Place to Hide in the trailer that we saw from Metal Gear Solid 4 is about Snake's age.

886
00:55:28,130 --> 00:55:31,411
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, this doesn't take no place to hide from death.

887
00:55:32,791 --> 00:55:43,354
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, because he is a clone of Big Boss, this is only a few years later after number two, or three, I guess, whatever.

888
00:55:43,554 --> 00:55:45,374
[SPEAKER_02]: No, number two, because three took place before two.

889
00:55:46,295 --> 00:55:47,235
[SPEAKER_03]: I've gone cross-eyed.

890
00:55:49,035 --> 00:55:56,197
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, so they haven't really said too much else other than there's going to be two different sides that you can either ally with

891
00:55:57,148 --> 00:55:58,949
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still like the little snatcher bot.

892
00:55:59,369 --> 00:56:00,669
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks sexy.

893
00:56:00,829 --> 00:56:02,610
[SPEAKER_03]: I still need to get into Metal Gear Solid.

894
00:56:03,050 --> 00:56:08,652
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, though, there's another fun parody of that on VGCats, also their most recent comic.

895
00:56:08,713 --> 00:56:10,073
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really a solid snake.

896
00:56:10,093 --> 00:56:11,734
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they paying you money under the table or something?

897
00:56:12,114 --> 00:56:13,614
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I just love that.

898
00:56:13,654 --> 00:56:14,875
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like my favorite webcomic.

899
00:56:14,935 --> 00:56:15,995
[SPEAKER_03]: No, Spamusement all the way.

900
00:56:16,856 --> 00:56:18,816
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, video game related webcomics.

901
00:56:18,856 --> 00:56:21,477
[SPEAKER_00]: Spamusement, I have to say, is the only one that makes me crack up like crazy.

902
00:56:21,998 --> 00:56:22,758
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, anyway.

903
00:56:23,271 --> 00:56:23,551
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

904
00:56:23,671 --> 00:56:24,091
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

905
00:56:24,131 --> 00:56:24,831
[SPEAKER_03]: We're definitely done.

906
00:56:24,851 --> 00:56:26,472
[SPEAKER_03]: When we're talking about webcomics, we know we're done.

907
00:56:26,652 --> 00:56:27,792
[SPEAKER_00]: Nail, coffin, bang.

908
00:56:28,052 --> 00:56:29,372
[SPEAKER_02]: Final thoughts, Loki.

909
00:56:29,772 --> 00:56:31,572
[SPEAKER_02]: OLRPSB.com.

910
00:56:31,652 --> 00:56:32,013
[SPEAKER_02]: Visit it.

911
00:56:32,093 --> 00:56:32,653
[SPEAKER_02]: It's awesome.

912
00:56:32,713 --> 00:56:33,413
[SPEAKER_02]: It's sexy.

913
00:56:33,813 --> 00:56:34,613
[SPEAKER_02]: Download a wallpaper.

914
00:56:35,313 --> 00:56:35,653
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.

915
00:56:35,673 --> 00:56:36,093
[SPEAKER_02]: And a podcast.

916
00:56:37,133 --> 00:56:40,214
[SPEAKER_00]: Reject false icons and balls.

917
00:56:41,254 --> 00:56:44,895
[SPEAKER_03]: And my final thought is Blue Mage on Final Fantasy XI.

918
00:56:45,195 --> 00:56:45,495
Awesome.

919
00:56:47,235 --> 00:56:48,275
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't make a time out of me.

920
00:56:48,295 --> 00:56:49,696
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know when they get GM answer.

921
00:56:50,136 --> 00:56:50,396
[SPEAKER_03]: I will.

922
00:56:50,716 --> 00:56:51,916
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, are you going to come back?

923
00:56:52,995 --> 00:56:55,056
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I just want to laugh.

924
00:56:55,156 --> 00:56:55,536
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

925
00:56:56,497 --> 00:56:57,177
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the show.

926
00:56:57,217 --> 00:56:58,118
[SPEAKER_03]: Time made.
