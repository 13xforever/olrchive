00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Hello, everybody. Once again, welcome to the Orange Lounge Radio 2 Go Edition, your home for all that news that gamers really want to know about.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,760
Thanks so much for subscribing to us, we really do appreciate your support.

6
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:37,760
We are an independent production, you know, it's just three buddies here doing a show

7
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,120
out of a spare bedroom in one of our apartments, really.

8
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,000
So we appreciate you guys supporting just, you know, the independent podcast.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,680
We do this because we love video games and we never shut up about them.

10
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,600
Isn't that right, Dark Sakura, one of my lovely co-hosts over there?

11
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,120
I don't shut up about anything ever.

12
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,200
This is true.

13
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,520
Video games is one of them though, right?

14
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:01,840
Yeah, I'd have to say video games are probably up at the top of the list, that and Serenity.

15
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,720
Loki is here as well, the tech master Loki.

16
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:04,720
Yes, I am.

17
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05,720
How are you doing?

18
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:06,720
I'm good.

19
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:07,800
He never shuts up about video games either.

20
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:12,920
Yeah, and in fact, even the people I work with who we sell video games and they still

21
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,240
don't like listening to me.

22
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,240
But you love bacon.

23
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,520
Yes, I have my I Love Bacon shirt on.

24
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,520
Awesome.

25
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,520
Good choice.

26
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,780
All right, let's get right into it.

27
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:23,780
We don't mess around.

28
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:27,620
into tonight's topics, we always start it off by letting you know what's going on in

29
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:31,660
our gaming world. Start off with Dark Sakura.

30
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:35,780
I did something really stupid. I did the wrong homework the week before last. So this week

31
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:41,140
I had to make up for that homework and my geography homework and do a humongous project

32
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:42,140
in Illustrator.

33
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:43,140
So no time for games.

34
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,140
I played with my puppies.

35
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:46,140
Okay, well that's something.

36
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:49,420
I did go into Bark Mode about three times this week though with other people.

37
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:51,580
All right, were you able to get any cool unlocks that way?

38
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:56,060
No, however, my friend has an extra Fireman's Hat and is going to lend it to me because

39
00:01:56,060 --> 00:02:00,860
if you ever have the Fireman's Hat in your inventory at any time, you will automatically

40
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:03,060
have a Dalmatian even if you give the hat away.

41
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,060
Interesting.

42
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,060
Okay.

43
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,260
So, I'm going to get a Dalmatian next week.

44
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:09,420
I have to be honest, I haven't been that into Nintendogs.

45
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:10,420
It's kind of my interest.

46
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:11,420
Did your puppies run away?

47
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:15,700
No, not yet, but they all have fleas because I haven't been bathing them.

48
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:16,700
Ew.

49
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:17,700
Oh well.

50
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,580
Loki, what's your game that we've been like?

51
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:25,280
I tried Lost in Blue Bit for the DS and that was kind of fun and then had to play the stupid

52
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,200
dogs because otherwise they'll run away.

53
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,740
You know, I'm actually taking two of my copies back.

54
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:32,300
I don't want them.

55
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:36,620
The game's not that interesting and after, you know, buying...

56
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:41,140
Well, you did kind of make a mistake by buying all three versions and not realizing that

57
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:42,140
all you've seen...

58
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:43,140
I didn't know.

59
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,140
I didn't realize it.

60
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,920
You need to bring your other versions so that I can get your dogs.

61
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,920
I guess.

62
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,020
We'll have to do that before I return them, but...

63
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:53,860
Anyways, so the other than that, I've been playing DDR Extreme 2, and that was fun.

64
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:57,740
That's a good dance game, except my dance pads don't work it right now, so I have to

65
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,740
play it on the controller.

66
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:00,740
Boring.

67
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:02,100
Ah, whatever.

68
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:06,380
You know, when I was staring at my copy of Graffiti Kingdom this week, thinking, when

69
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:13,300
am I going to play this, and I didn't play it this week, so maybe next week.

70
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:17,580
But yeah, hopefully I'm going to be playing some more PSP games, especially tomorrow,

71
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:22,140
or not tomorrow, on Tuesday, because I potentially have jury duty and I've got to wait all day

72
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:25,280
to get called in. So, lots of time for the portable games.

73
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:30,000
If it makes you feel any better, my copy of We Love Katamari is still unwrapped.

74
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,460
But you did finally get it. Yes, I got it the night after the show.

75
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:40,000
It's not such a touchy subject for you anymore. No, not as touchy. It's a very wrapped subject.

76
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,400
I keep it under wraps. That was awful.

77
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,400
That was awful.

78
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,400
That was really bad.

79
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,400
Boo!

80
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,400
Alright.

81
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,400
I did it on purpose.

82
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,400
Anything else, Logie?

83
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,080
No, that's really it.

84
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,080
Alright.

85
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,160
Things that I have been playing this week, I actually checked out Pack and Roll for the

86
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,400
Nintendo DS.

87
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,820
Kind of fun, it's pretty cool.

88
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,720
It's one of those, like, kind of quickie games.

89
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,440
Like, it's a game that I don't think I could really see myself, like, oh, I'm gonna sit

90
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,920
down for three hours and just have a marathon Pack and Roll session.

91
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,440
It's kind of one of those things where, like, yeah, I could, like, fire this up, play a

92
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:14,780
level while I'm waiting for something else, then just save it and do it again later.

93
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:19,580
So it's kind of a nice, simple, relaxing action game.

94
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:24,500
I spent at least 30 minutes on it at E3, on the one level.

95
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:28,220
I didn't find it to be quite so addicting, I mean it was kind of cool, it was a really

96
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:29,220
cool concept.

97
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:33,180
Yes, it kind of whores the stylus features of the DS out, but you know, it's in a good

98
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,180
way.

99
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:35,180
I guess that's what the stylus is for.

100
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:39,260
I like the idea that you kind of use Pac-Man as like a trackball, although part of me kind

101
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:42,520
of wonders what that game would be like if you actually had a trackball. The game would

102
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:47,460
surprisingly be a hell of a lot like Crystal Castles, that old, old Atari game.

103
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,660
It made me think of Marble Madness.

104
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:52,540
Marble Madness kind of, I thought, because with the dots and everything, it really reminded

105
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:58,340
me of Crystal Castles, but instead you were using the stylus to kind of draw your kind

106
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:03,340
of roll with the pen, so it was kind of neat. And you do like all these different moves.

107
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:06,660
It's still kind of only like a borderline recommendation for me though. I think if you're

108
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:10,280
a fan of this type of genre, I think you'll get a kick out of this, but it's also a type

109
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:15,660
of thing that I kind of, I couldn't see myself playing it for a heck of a long time. I couldn't

110
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:19,100
see myself playing this game until I beat it. I think I'd kind of get sick of it. And

111
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:24,100
the graphics weren't, the graphics, it looked like a Playstation game on my DS, which I

112
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:27,780
guess is kind of cool, but I don't know, I don't think I really liked the graphical style

113
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:32,140
of the game. It was kind of dumb. I didn't care for it, but Pac-Man looked really cute

114
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:36,340
in the little bottom window where he's the controller.

115
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:41,700
Better than Pac-Pix. Pac-Pix sucked. And I got rid of that game quick. And then I got

116
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:45,300
this game. And I was just like, eh. Eh.

117
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,620
Dude, Pac-Pix was awesome.

118
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:51,660
So borderline recommendation for Pac and Roll for me. The other game, I didn't play this

119
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:54,720
enough. I'm not going to make a final judgment on this game. I did play a little bit of Lost

120
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:00,020
in Blue. It seemed a little... I don't know if it's just not my type of game. If I'm just

121
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:04,200
not into those point-and-click games. Although, I don't know, for some reason I was thinking

122
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:09,400
like King's Quest, but with the little added, like, you can actually use the stylus to dig

123
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:15,040
in the sand and kind of explore. Seemed a little gimmicky to me, but I don't think

124
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,660
I played enough of the game to really get a feel for this yet. I want to give the game

125
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:20,020
another shot, so I'm not going to make a final judgment on it yet, but I did check

126
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:23,580
it out. I don't know if I'm going to like this one, though. It just doesn't seem

127
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:24,900
like my kind of game, but we'll see.

128
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:28,820
I played it for a little bit. I played it through the first day that you're on the

129
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:34,940
Island, and it's like you have to do things really in order, otherwise you're only player

130
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:37,740
is going to die, because you start off with very little life, and it's just like...

131
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:41,420
It seemed like it would be really easy to lose in the beginning, a little frustrating,

132
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:43,300
but I don't know, I'm going to wait and play it more.

133
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:47,620
It was pretty frustrating. I hear like trying to hunt the animals and stuff later on is

134
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:52,260
even more frustrating, and just stuff that, the games are very frustrating.

135
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:56,160
Oh, and the text boxes were horrible too, like you only see one line of text at a time,

136
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,600
and you have to wait, even though I put my display speed on fast, I don't like that method

137
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:04,800
of showing text. So, I don't know if I'm going to like this one, guys, but I'm not making

138
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,460
a final judgment yet. There might be something that happens. There's a lot of games I first

139
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,940
play and I don't like them, and then I warm up to them later. So, I'm going to check it

140
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:14,380
out. A lot of games coming out next month I want for the DS, like Trauma Center. That's

141
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:17,120
going to be fun. I want to check out Trauma Center as well. There's something I'm waiting

142
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:22,160
on for the GBA. What's that? A whole lot. Gunstar Super Heroes. Oh, yeah, that game

143
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,000
looks like it's going to be awesome. One other game I checked out this week was Dance Dance

144
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,160
Revolution Extreme 2, of course, you know, Orange Launch Radio was started on the music

145
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:33,100
video games and kind of grew beyond that, but you know, I still have a place in my heart

146
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,480
for the music video games.

147
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:39,560
Dance Dance Revolution Extreme 2, if you are a fan of the dancing games in any capacity,

148
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:43,520
you must, I highly recommend Dance Dance Revolution Extreme 2.

149
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:49,040
I talked about this a lot more on Sunday night's live 3 hour show, but I think it really kind

150
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:55,500
of transitioned the series from being an arcade port, which every other version before this

151
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:01,040
was, to a home console version of DDR, and that's through the dance master mode where

152
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:05,480
you kind of learn, and it's very similar to BeatMania 2DX's drill mode, where you kind

153
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:09,940
of do little missions and step on these arrows and do this part of the song and get a full

154
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:15,220
combo here, but that's really how you unlock all your songs, and I think that's just kind

155
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:20,240
of a neat concept, a neat way to do the game, so I think fans of the series are going to

156
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,360
love it and there's just a great song list for fans of Babani. If you're not so much

157
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:29,320
a dance game fan, if you're just the type that plays the games casually, I don't think

158
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:33,620
Extreme 2 is a good entry level pick. I think it's not a good party game because the song

159
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:37,840
list is so limited to just the licenses when you first start and you really have to work

160
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:42,120
at it to get unlocks, unlike the other games which were all time unlocks. And supposedly

161
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:45,700
this game has time unlocks in it as well, we don't know yet for sure, but I haven't

162
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:50,920
played it enough to really know for sure. So, if you're more of a casual fan or if you're

163
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:55,680
curious about DDR, I would recommend you start on Max 2, which was from two years ago, but

164
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:00,200
it had a very solid song list and, you know, I think it was a lot more accessible for people

165
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:04,580
who hadn't really played DDR before, so that's just my recommendation. Otherwise, graphics

166
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:09,220
in the game are great, they gave every song a unique music video this time, it's great.

167
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:13,380
The sound, of course, kick butt song list, couple of licenses I didn't like, but that's

168
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:16,700
bound to happen when you have such a diverse song list.

169
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:19,580
And the gameplay, it's DDR.

170
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:20,580
What else can I say?

171
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:26,260
So, highly recommend if you're a fan of music games, kinda borderline if you're not so much,

172
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:29,220
if you just are interested in dance games and want to get into the series.

173
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:33,020
I have to disagree with most of the music selection, though, because I wasn't too impressed.

174
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:34,020
With what you heard.

175
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:38,460
Yeah, it wasn't, it was like a bunch of repetitive, old, same old trance.

176
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:42,100
I think when you see what they picked from the old games, though, to put next to it,

177
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:46,340
though, I think it makes it a lot more solid. They really took a lot of the things the fans

178
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:53,260
have been asking for for years. Sakura, Daikonkai, Cartoon Heroes, Sink, it's all in there. So

179
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:57,420
that's kind of nice that Konami, you know, really, I think, really listen to their DDR

180
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:02,020
fans on this one. Anyway, yes?

181
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:08,020
I actually did have something that I had forgotten to mention earlier.

182
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:10,020
Back to the Gunstar Heroes release.

183
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:13,020
There's actually going to be a Sega Ages treasure chest.

184
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:16,020
I found this on Treasure's homepage.

185
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:21,020
It's featuring Gunstar Heroes' dynamite heady alien soldier.

186
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:27,020
And of course in the Sega Ages 2500 collection it will be sold for 2500 yen.

187
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:29,020
And I hope that comes out here.

188
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:34,020
Also, Treasure is doing the Bleach game, but that's off of the anime.

189
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,020
Hmm.

190
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,020
Okay.

191
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:37,020
Cool.

192
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:38,020
If it's Treasure, it's gotta be good.

193
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:40,460
You know, I actually liked the SEGA collection they put out.

194
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:44,180
A lot of people really panned it and said it was awful, and I guess that's probably

195
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:47,040
because of the Golden Axe remake, but you know, I thought it was a good deal.

196
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,420
I thought it was better than that Namco collection that just came out.

197
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:51,420
I thought the SEGA one was way better, but...

198
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:55,100
I didn't buy it because we've already so far have some of the SEGA Aegis games we went

199
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,820
to since we imported them.

200
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:59,460
Have any of you guys picked up the Midway Arcade Treasures 3 yet?

201
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:02,980
Not three, I'm definitely interested because it has, I didn't even realize this game was

202
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:05,000
in it, but it has Iron Man's Off-Road in it.

203
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,340
That was like my favorite racing game, which is kind of not even really, like, it's borderline

204
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:10,340
racing.

205
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,340
But yeah, I want to check that out.

206
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:12,620
I've heard good things about it.

207
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:14,620
I'll tell you what broke my heart.

208
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:19,580
Our landlord, who's actually good friends of ours, cleaned out some stuff out of their

209
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:26,620
attic in the garage and brought down an Atari 2600 wood grain that had cobwebs all over

210
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:33,020
right now. It made my heart break to have a box full of games. I was like, noooo! Except

211
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:37,980
it was like that slow motion, noooo!

212
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:40,520
Loki got me thinking about racing games. You know, did you hear about what's coming to

213
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:44,360
America that was in Japan, but it's finally, it's going to make its way in limited release

214
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,500
in America. At least I read this on some gaming site this week.

215
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,800
Mario Kart GP.

216
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:48,800
Mario Kart GP.

217
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,800
Sweet.

218
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,400
I know. I can't wait to check that out.

219
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,400
Alright.

220
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,840
You know what I actually think Nintendo should do?

221
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,840
Hmm?

222
00:11:54,840 --> 00:12:00,840
I know that some of the games were remade later on for the DS, not the DS, but the GameCube.

223
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,840
They should do like a 64 double D collection.

224
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,840
Possibly.

225
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,840
Because they got the 64 double D in Japan and we never got it.

226
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:14,840
But I heard that the version of F-Zero was supposed to be really excellent.

227
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,840
I mean, of course, we got an upgrade.

228
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,840
Maybe there's something you can download on the Revolution. Who knows?

229
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,840
Possible.

230
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,840
We'll see. Anyway, we need to do some follow-up from last week.

231
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:27,260
We had two contests last week, we're going to give away some stuff and the first thing

232
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:32,760
is we're going to give away a copy of the DDR Extreme 2 V-Rare as well as a copy of

233
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,920
the Max 2 V-Rare.

234
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,440
We gave one away on the live show last week and we told you guys on the podcast you had

235
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,520
a chance to enter this week.

236
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:43,920
Many of you did, so DarkSakura pull a number out of the hat and let's see who's going to

237
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,440
win the copy of the V-Rares.

238
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,400
Remember guys, these aren't games, they're the V-Rares, the soundtracks.

239
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:52,900
some folks in their email subjects that I want to win the games. Sorry, guys, it's just

240
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,900
the soundtracks. We don't have that big a budget yet.

241
00:12:54,900 --> 00:13:00,180
All right, who are we giving it to? What's the number? Number 28. Number 28, okay, let's

242
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:09,900
see, it's 15. This will be number 30. This is 28 right here. Our winner is Joseph E.

243
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:16,380
Joseph E. is the winner of the other soundtracks we're going to give away there. His email

244
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:20,160
address says Red Star in it, so I'm guessing that's his handle there. So congratulations

245
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:25,940
to you. You've won the other soundtracks. Good job.

246
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:28,500
Also what we're going to give away, we're going to give away, now this is a game that

247
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:32,160
we're giving away. We're giving away a copy of In the Groove and this is another dance

248
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,940
game that's out. We have a lot of dance games to give away. Are we going to give away some

249
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:39,800
non-dance games in the coming weeks, Loki? Yes, yes we are. Okay. Obviously we love dance

250
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:43,340
games, but we've got to give away some other stuff too. Anyway, this is a copy of In the

251
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:48,640
the Groove that has been autographed by all the hosts here at Orange Lounge Radio and

252
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:54,820
what you had to do was write a haiku about In the Groove and it had to be five syllables,

253
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:58,680
seven syllables, three syllables, not five, seven, five because that's a horrible inside

254
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,520
joke and Loki is going to sweeten the deal.

255
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,040
You're throwing in something else, aren't you?

256
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:08,120
I'm throwing in a t-shirt that says In the Courtroom but it's in the style of the logo

257
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:12,520
for In the Groove because they got sued by Konami.

258
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:18,520
Youíre going to throw in something that says ìIn the courtroom.î Then weíre also going

259
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:24,320
to give away to all of our winners, not just the folks who won In the Groove. We have some

260
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:29,400
Silent Hill 3 stickers that were given to us by somebody at Konami, so weíre going

261
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:34,040
to give away some Silent Hill 3 stickers to those folks that won all these various prizes.

262
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:38,600
We also decided to give a runner-up prize because we got so many hilarious haikus. Weíre

263
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,980
going to give away a runner-up prize as well. Weíre just going to give away some assorted

264
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:46,260
soundtracks that we have. I think we've got some, I want to say a Resident Evil soundtrack

265
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,260
or something.

266
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,260
And ESPN.

267
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:53,160
Yeah, so we're going to give away those soundtracks to our runner-up. Let's find out who won.

268
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:58,340
The runner-up, here is the haiku that is the runner-up in the in the Groove haiku contest.

269
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:06,340
Minds, mods, and much more. In the Groove will help you score, just not dates.

270
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:07,340
That was brilliant.

271
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,340
That was great. That's our runner-up.

272
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,340
It actually had a rhyme in it.

273
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:13,980
Yeah, that's good. That's our runner-up, Asian Buddy Paul. Asian Buddy Paul is our runner-up.

274
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:23,180
Congratulations. And here is our winner. You want a haiku? Maybe about In the Groove? They

275
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:30,220
got sued. That was the best. That was Justin M. is our winner of the In the Groove contest.

276
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:34,780
Congratulations. Yay. All right. Good job, guys. We did get lots of good ones. We did

277
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:38,860
get lots of good ones. You guys crack us up, so good job. We have to do more creativity

278
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:39,860
competitions.

279
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:40,860
Absolutely.

280
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:44,500
Encouraging people to use their brains and think independently is always good.

281
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,500
Absolutely.

282
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,500
Of course.

283
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,020
Alright, let's get into some gaming news tonight.

284
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:52,580
We're going to start off with some news about the Xbox 360.

285
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:58,620
GameSpot actually ran a report earlier this week that the Xbox Chief Officer Robbie Bach

286
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:05,360
expects half of all Xbox 360 owners to be on Xbox Live.

287
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,360
In the article, it goes on to say that only about 10% of current Xbox users, which would

288
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,600
be about 2 million people, use the current version of Xbox Live, but because theyíre

289
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:19,480
going to have this free silver version of Xbox Live thatís going to be on the 360,

290
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:24,800
the chief officer there believes that 50% of the users will go on because itís free.

291
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,280
And to me, I kind of think, ìWell, duh, yeah, if itís free, more people are going to use

292
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,880
it.î I actually think 50% is kind of low.

293
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,760
I think more people are wired this day and age for Internet access, high speed.

294
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,400
I think that they could maybe get more people on it.

295
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:40,640
He's not accounting for consumer apathy.

296
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,640
Maybe.

297
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,640
Maybe.

298
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:45,640
I don't know.

299
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:48,400
It seems to me like there's a possibility for distortion here, because if the only way

300
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:54,400
that you can really play the games online is to do the Xbox Gold, because we did this

301
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,400
a few weeks back.

302
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,140
We were talking about the differences between silver and gold.

303
00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:00,120
Silver just basically got you on there and you could communicate with people, but you

304
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,640
couldn't really play them, right?

305
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:02,640
You have to go gold for that.

306
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,640
That would be correct.

307
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:07,080
they end up saying that 70% of the people are on Xbox Live. Well, does that mean 70%

308
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:11,720
of the people are playing games on there? No, so I don't know. I don't know how much

309
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,720
weight this story holds.

310
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,720
It's a huge number, that's all.

311
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:16,880
I was kind of surprised this story got as much attention as it did, because I'm like,

312
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,760
so, if it's free, people are going to use it. I don't know.

313
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,320
I think that wins the award of the evening.

314
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:27,280
We'll see. We'll see. Dark Soccer, you actually had a story about the Xbox 360's launch as

315
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,280
well, didn't you?

316
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:36,200
Actually, I got an email from one of our listeners, one of our regular writers as well, from Rob

317
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:39,080
with Two Bees.

318
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:43,400
I'm just going to go ahead and read this email real quick, just because I think it's very

319
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,920
well written and brings up a good point.

320
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:50,760
It's been hitting the internet gaming news about Microsoft rejecting the Blu-ray DVD

321
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,760
format.

322
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,980
I'm not really interested in the reasons, but rather why it's an issue at all, so maybe

323
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,800
the crew can help me with that.

324
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,980
I actually thought it would be a good thing to bring up for discussion.

325
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:04,620
Unless you have three hours of video, why would one DVD be insufficient for a game?

326
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:08,260
The reason I ask myself this is how can there be so much code

327
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:12,400
and support files to engulf an entire DVD? The compiled code itself should be a

328
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,280
fraction of the entire content,

329
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:18,280
but I've noticed that games of

330
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:21,360
practically the same complexity as Tetris

331
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:25,480
are three megabytes and higher. This can only mean developer kits, uncompressed

332
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:30,160
files and non-optimized code. I'd be the first to admit that devkits are necessary, but why

333
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,920
are companies compiling all of the libraries into a game that use less than half of all

334
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:38,200
the features? There's no one answer to that question. It's most likely a combination of

335
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:43,280
sufficient documentation, closed source code, programming shops, and the acceptance of software

336
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:49,520
that barely meets the expected performance. All of that excepted, it still has to be unnecessarily

337
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:53,680
large support files that really push them over the edge. Overly large and or detailed

338
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:59,680
bitmaps compressed along with the code instead of as bitmaps. The same with video and sound.

339
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:04,640
It may not use more of the file specific compression algorithms. It brings me to a conclusion that

340
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,740
if the file fills more than a DVD, you may want to reconsider your content. Make sure

341
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:14,800
that you�re not adding fluff to distract the player from the core game is absolutely

342
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:18,520
piece of crap. Almost every movie licensed game fits this description.

343
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:23,200
Interesting. You know, my initial thought as to why you would need so much space though

344
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,560
is that isn't the Xbox 360, if I'm not mistaken, isn't Microsoft forcing all the Xbox 360 games

345
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,600
to be high-def compatible?

346
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,820
I believe so.

347
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:36,520
Which I think is a good thing. Nintendo, are you listening? And that would take up more

348
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,760
space by default, I would think.

349
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,240
I don't think it would take up a whole DVD.

350
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:43,960
Well, I think the thing is when you're pushing these higher-res games, you're going to have

351
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:48,060
higher-res textures. More of them, if you've seen Project Anthem Racing, they mean whole

352
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:52,160
buildings are textured. Of course, it takes up more space. It's not coding that's going

353
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:58,040
to take up space at all. Coding is tiny. It's basically all these textures and audio and

354
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:03,020
stuff that you've got. I don't even know how many channels of audio you've got on the 360

355
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:09,500
and stuff, 5.1 and everything. It's the difference between why a DVD video file is 4 gigs and

356
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:15,420
a DivX file is only 600 megs. In quality, you're going to see a big difference there

357
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:19,260
too. Blu-ray, the only reason they're not going with Blu-ray is because Sony is the

358
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:23,700
one thatís making Blu-ray so, duh, theyíre not going to support their competitor.

359
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:28,420
I agree though with whatís being said about it really comes down to the quality of games.

360
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:32,420
You know, thereís going to be those crap games that donít make good use of the space,

361
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:36,500
but I really think there will be games out there that are just going to have some stunning

362
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:41,600
cut scenes and things that could take up, you know, feasibly more room than a normal

363
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:46,300
DVD could handle. I donít know if there will be any launch titles, but you know, I think

364
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:50,940
down the line if there's that room for expansion, naturally the games have to grow.

365
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:56,220
Well, I also got another email that's sort of the converse of that. One of our other

366
00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:03,800
listeners, Tony, brought to our attention this. Something about Volision recently stating

367
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:07,820
that their 360 game Saints Row will not have flyable aircraft because they can't stream

368
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:14,220
the hard drive data fast enough from the disk. They will have to use the hard drive, but

369
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:17,920
I'm just quoting here, as we know developers can't assume the hard drive will always be

370
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:18,920
there for the 360.

371
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:22,720
So, the question is, do you see this as a growing trend where we're going to see more

372
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:27,640
eye candy and less game play?

373
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,200
I think unfortunately that's kind of...

374
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,200
I think it's kind of...

375
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,200
It's happening already.

376
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,200
I think it's been a trend that's been happening already.

377
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,200
Absolutely.

378
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,200
I think there's games...

379
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,680
But, you know, sometimes there's games out there that have a lot of good eye candy, but

380
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:39,000
they have good game play too, like Xenosaga comes to mind.

381
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,700
I mean, God, that game was like half just sit and watch the cut scenes, but it was still

382
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:54,780
a good game, but I think what he said there about the movie franchise games are some of

383
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,260
the biggest culprits of that stuff.

384
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:59,180
Not always, but usually the biggest culprits of that stuff, I think he made an excellent

385
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:00,180
point with that.

386
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:03,460
I think those games have always been about the eye candy a lot of times and making you

387
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:06,660
remember the movie and things.

388
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:11,100
I think it's kind of a trend that's going on already and I think it will just continue

389
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,100
to go.

390
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:17,580
that was the big thing that spawned the whole, oh, PlayStation is better than Saturn bullshit

391
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:22,500
of a few years ago. The thing is, though, is that most of the people that were saying

392
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:27,540
that never imported a single Saturn game, and were not 2D gamers.

393
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:30,180
I think this goes all the way back to Super Nintendo. Remember those games that would

394
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:32,320
horror mode 7? Yeah.

395
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:37,420
And there was really nothing else to it. It was just, oh, look at the pretty mode 7.

396
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:43,020
But then again, the Super Nintendo, you know, they had, they were one of the first systems

397
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:44,020
to do polygons.

398
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:45,020
True.

399
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:49,020
Although, actually, there was a system out before that that did it, but not in America.

400
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:55,860
The PC Engine Duo had a game called Sapphire that was one of their arcade card games, which

401
00:22:55,860 --> 00:23:00,260
that system was so intelligent to have those upgradeable cards to support the different

402
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:01,260
games.

403
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:03,540
But I've played this game.

404
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:09,340
It's got really pretty graphics in it for its time, and in-game polygons.

405
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:12,580
There were some great mode 7 games, such as pilot wings, I loved, and some of the other

406
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:13,580
older ones.

407
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:17,780
We had Star Fox, I mean, even FX in, like, Dracula X.

408
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:21,280
But see, you had the Star Fox game, but then there was some buggy racing game or something

409
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,280
that was stupid.

410
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,280
I didn't like it.

411
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,280
Stunt Race FX.

412
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,280
Stunt Race FX.

413
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,280
Yeah, that was one of them.

414
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,280
I didn't like that.

415
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:32,280
But some of the other races, F-Zero.

416
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,280
Sure.

417
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:40,280
We got to move on though. If you want to email us, send us an email at togo at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

418
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,280
We'll get to some more emails a little later in the show, yes?

419
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,280
All right.

420
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:47,280
Loki, you had a story about now the Xbox 360. There was some type of teaser site going on

421
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:50,560
and the countdown finished this week. What happened?

422
00:23:50,560 --> 00:24:00,400
Origin Xbox360.com. It would have been great if you live in the UK because guess what?

423
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:08,040
it's a UK launch site. Basically, you can enter to win a trip to the launch party that's

424
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:13,720
in Vegas, if I remember correctly, or New York in the United States, but you have to

425
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:18,140
be in the UK in order to enter this. Basically, the website was teasing it with some cutout

426
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:23,640
pictures of rabbits and this giant tree that was growing. At the very end, you have these

427
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:27,720
rabbits and the whole thing reminds me of Monty Python, the way it's done. Basically,

428
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:32,080
the rabbits, one of them eats the fruit that makes them hallucinate, and then you go to

429
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:36,600
the maiden site. It was a complete letdown. We were thinking it was going to be something

430
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,440
cool, but unless you were in the UK, it was not.

431
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,560
But we do have listeners in the UK, so hey.

432
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,720
Hey, good for you guys. Congratulations.

433
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:51,600
It's a great site. It's cute. It has rabbits that talk and little bunny things. I love

434
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:58,600
bunnies and then 10 bunnies would be good, but the problem is they multiply too fast.

435
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:04,840
Yeah, I don't know. It was a really cool site. Unfortunately, it's only for the U.K.

436
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:10,180
The punchline sucked, in other words. It was really dumb because the whole thing,

437
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:14,060
if you have a launch site like this and you're basically making it seem like, oh, the world's

438
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:19,760
connected, except for you people in the U.S., you're not connected to the world, so forget

439
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,760
you.

440
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:25,000
Well speaking, now we talk a lot about release dates in the US for games here on the show,

441
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:30,040
but Dark Sakura once in a while likes to give our UK listeners, because we have a pretty

442
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:33,400
big group there that listens, and thanks to you guys in the UK that listen, not just there,

443
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:37,440
but we have folks in Australia, Asia, all over the world listening to this program.

444
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,800
Love you guys, unfortunately we can't go over everybody's calendar, but we do once in a

445
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:44,240
while like to go over the UK's calendar, and Dark Sakura wants to let you guys know what's

446
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,600
going on for the release calendar in Europe.

447
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:51,120
We have a number of games coming out this week, Black and White 2 for the PC, Armored

448
00:25:51,120 --> 00:26:02,440
Core Nexus, Geist, King of Fighters 2003 for Xbox, Nintendogs is coming out in the UK on

hasn't come out yet it's not coming out until November

457
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:48,320
According to Eurogamer, their release is October 21st for the UK.

458
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:48,920
Lucky them.

459
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:52,320
Yeah, because November it's not coming out until, I think, the second or third week.

460
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:52,820
It's a good thing-

461
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:53,620
Oh, wait, no, wait!

462
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:54,920
No, I'm sorry, that was October.

463
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,420
We're getting it a week later, though.

464
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:58,820
It's a good thing I could care less about Dragon Ball Z.

465
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:01,720
Genji is also coming out, which is actually a game that I have at home.

466
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,220
And we did bring a pack and roll earlier.

467
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:04,520
They get it on the 28th.

468
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,020
All right.

469
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:06,620
Zen Osaka Episode 2, also on the 28th.

470
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:10,520
If you know a place that rents DS games, seriously, rent Before You Buy on that one.

471
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:13,920
I think it's one of those ones you'll love it or you'll not.

472
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:14,920
Alright, thank you.

473
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:15,920
You're welcome.

474
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:16,920
Cool.

475
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:21,960
Let's move on to, I've got to ask Loki, kind of our hack and crack guy, I don't

476
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:26,280
follow the hack scene so much, but obviously I heard the big news about the 2.0 downgrade.

477
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,280
What happened?

478
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:35,540
Okay, so the people that found that bug to begin with, in the 2.0 firmware, basically

479
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:40,520
be able to launch their own code by doing a buffer overflow.

480
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:46,220
They basically created this program to make the PSP think that's version 1.0.

481
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:51,160
When you do that, then you can run the version 1.5 update and basically downgrade your entire

482
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,840
PSP.

483
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:55,580
This method has been posted all over the place.

484
00:27:55,580 --> 00:28:02,120
I think it started off at psphacks.com is where they originally posted it.

485
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:08,600
Basically everyone that had version 1.51 or 1.52 or even a 2.0, they've been downgrading

486
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:14,360
to play the homebrew stuff again. So, what would you expect Sony to do? Yes, they released

487
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,360
version 2.01.

488
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:19,800
No surprise there. So now, so if you were thinking about going back and forth between

489
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:25,820
2.0 and 1.5, it's going to be hard to get on 2.0 now, unless you know where to get.

490
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:29,840
Not exactly. If you're the one that's in the homebrew site, they do have links to the firmware.

491
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:33,300
They do keep copies on their servers for the Japanese and stuff, so.

492
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:37,820
Not surprised Sony ticked off about this, although you'd think they'd embrace the homebrew

493
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:38,820
thing a little more.

494
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:39,820
No.

495
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:40,820
You'd think they'd take advantage of it.

496
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:42,460
They'd take advantage of it, at least, you know?

497
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:43,460
I don't know.

498
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:46,380
I was telling my guy that, you know, represents H-Tech, I'm like, why aren't they coming

499
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:48,620
out with RPG Maker for the end of the PSP?

500
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:50,180
I'm like, it'd be freaking sweet.

501
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:51,900
You'd put your own textures and stuff in there.

502
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:53,960
You can distribute your games online.

503
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:56,100
It's homebrew, but it's legal.

504
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,500
I mean, what more would you want?

505
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:02,620
But I always found it interesting that, like, in the 2.0 upgrade, there were things, like,

506
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:05,940
remember there was a hack a few months ago before 2.0 came out that would allow you to

507
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:10,180
changed the background on your PSP and then they implemented that in 2.0. I thought that

508
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:11,180
was kind of interesting.

509
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:17,300
Yeah, there's stuff like that, but that's the thing though. The other reason is people

510
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:20,820
are only really upgrading to use the web browser, but when you think about it, the web browser

511
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:26,580
is kind of useless anyways. I don't know, there's not a lot of sites that support it

512
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:32,340
right now. It doesn't support Flash and it's really limited on, it doesn't support Java.

513
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:37,980
us, so it's like, they're teething, oh, well, maybe future firmware updates will implement

514
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:42,220
that. Well, thank you for releasing something crippled for us. Thank you. Appreciate it.

515
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:45,940
Yeah, a good way for them to cover their tracks when this kind of stuff comes up, though.

516
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:51,540
But the whole thing is, they're working with Homebrew on even the 2.0, and if they get

517
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:54,840
smart enough, they're going to figure out how to just rip stuff out of the different

518
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:58,260
updates and build their own update. That's what's going to happen.

519
00:29:58,260 --> 00:29:59,260
Interesting.

520
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:03,100
And speaking of updates, I have to warn a few people here.

521
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:09,020
There was something going around actually that was basically saying it's a patcher

522
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:18,460
that will fix your PHP to add the browser in there as well.

523
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:22,900
And it's basically this patcher that's been going around, I don't know who is releasing

524
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:29,140
a PSP team supposedly and it will actually crash your PSP and destroy it.

525
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:33,140
always got to be somebody that wants to mess it up for everybody else.

526
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:40,060
So yeah, don't download that but do find the big links for it. It's out there.

527
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:45,500
Now speaking of the PSP, we here at Orange Lounge Radio have a pretty hefty announcement

528
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:50,420
and I think it's time to mention what it is. Loki, what is going on Orange Lounge Radio

529
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:51,420
PSP wise?

530
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:56,480
Well, everybody's having the PSP and those people do have the 2.0 browser or A web browser

531
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:00,580
out there that they're using on the PSP or looking for more portals and links and stuff

532
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:02,960
like that.

533
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:09,240
We here at Orange Launch Radio decided it's time to get with things and we like to be

534
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:15,540
innovative and jumped on the whole podcasting thing right when it was getting started here.

535
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:23,400
So now we actually will be announcing the launch of OLRPSP.com, which will be our PSP

536
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,400
formatted site.

537
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:29,020
find links to download a podcast straight to your PSP. Weíre going to have downloads

538
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:33,820
just like we have a wallpaper on there now that you can download for it. And plus youíll

539
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:39,060
be able to keep up with the news that we have and a lot of other things, just more features.

540
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:46,060
So thatís OLRPSP.com. Now you can visit this on a PC but on your regular Internet Explorer

541
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:50,620
500, itís going to look kind of crappy because this site is formatted for your PSP. This

542
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:53,740
is specifically for those folks.

543
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:58,620
it looks kind of okay on a... It's okay, but if you're wondering why it

544
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:01,620
looks all funky, it's because it's specifically for a PSP.

545
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:03,860
It looks pretty good if you have a high-definition screen.

546
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:07,660
Oh yeah, oh yeah. Yeah, it looks really nice.

547
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:12,980
Loki and VX Jason XV, our tech guy behind the scenes, you guys did an incredible job

548
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:15,860
on this and I think people are going to love it because I love the way you guys designed

549
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:19,140
the site. You didn't make it. You used a lot of image maps in your design

550
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:23,300
and I think that's a great way to browse on the PSP, so check it out guys.

551
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:28,760
And I've got my 2.0 PSP that I was actually testing it with right as I'm making it so

552
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:33,980
make sure that everything worked, that it looked nice. And it just works awesome. And

553
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:38,740
the first wallpaper we have, I have it on my PSP. It looks nice. It doesn't detract

554
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:42,460
from the icons so you can see everything. And ironically enough, it worked out that

555
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,620
way but it's just really cool.

556
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:47,540
Let's check that out, OLRPSP.com.

557
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:51,060
No WWW, remember folks, because otherwise that won't work.

558
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:52,060
Really?

559
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:58,420
All right, check that out. All right, moving on. Let's go to another story

560
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:05,860
here. I have a story about Disgaea 2. A lot of folks are really into Disgaea. Cute story.

561
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:11,860
Very cute story to it and a very interesting game there. Disgaea 2 has been announced in

562
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:20,460
the latest issue of Dengeki PS2. It's going to be out for 2006. That is going to be what

563
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:27,800
is coming out, and the Etna, Devil Girl Etna, and the Prinnies, the little penguin guys,

564
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:35,280
they will be coming back in the next Disgaea as well. Some cameos as well of characters

565
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:42,000
from Makai Kingdom, which was another game in that same series, I believe, or at least

566
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,880
from the same developer. Yeah, it's the same series.

567
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:49,120
That was the, what game? Not La Poussel, that was a different game.

568
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:56,000
Monkei Tencho? Yeah. Monkei Kingdom. So check that out there, it's going to be a very similar

569
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:02,480
game with the combo system and everything is coming back. So that's Disgaea 2. Let's

570
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:07,800
go on to, I think what we should do now, we've talked an awful lot about a lot of games so

571
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:13,300
far, haven't we? Yeah. So I think what we need to do, we need to talk about some real

572
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:18,120
life things. And you know, we here at Orange Lounge Radio, we can't play video games all

573
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:22,360
all day long because if we played video games all day long, we'd have no time to design

574
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:28,040
websites. So DarkSakura is here to remind you guys there is a whole world out there

575
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:32,600
and she would like to give you some advice to help you survive in the world. So DarkSakura,

576
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:38,520
what are you going to talk to the kids about tonight? Today's bit of advice is how to survive

577
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:45,120
a bird attack. Like in the Hitchcock movie? Yeah. Okay. There's even, I even have a picture

578
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,920
that looks like it's from the birds.

579
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:49,560
Number one, watch for hovering and clacking.

580
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:52,400
If you observe this behavior, be ready for an attack.

581
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,880
Two, close your eyes and cover your ears.

582
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:57,040
The birds will swoop down quickly, striking at the head

583
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,280
or shoulders with its wings or beak.

584
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,880
Three, run for cover away from nesting and foraging areas.

585
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,960
Run as fast as you can away from the areas

586
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,480
that the bird is protecting.

587
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,560
Many species of birds will attack if their nests

588
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:11,560
or foraging areas are disturbed, even incidentally.

589
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,520
If a bird attacks, it will continue to attack

590
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:19,640
until you leave these areas. But my final bit of advice is don't wander onto the set

591
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:20,640
of Hitchcock remakes.

592
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:25,640
And also, they're birds. I mean, come on. You should be able to fight off birds. They're

593
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:26,640
small.

594
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,120
When they say, don't feed the pigeons, they effin' mean it.

595
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:33,920
It's just a bird. It's not like a giant duck or goose or something. I mean, if you have

596
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,960
like a flock of geese or something that are...

597
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:36,960
A flock of seagulls.

598
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:41,240
Or a flock of, well, seagulls are just pathetic. I mean, they'll drop dead when you give them

599
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:46,320
you know, Alka-Seltzer, but seriously, I mean, they're birds. I was attacked by a flock of

600
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:49,980
seagulls once, and you know what? I ran. I ran so far away.

601
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:55,600
Did it give you bad hair? Stop. Loki, you've got a story about the Nintendo

602
00:35:55,600 --> 00:36:01,520
Wi-Fi DS system that's coming up, and I'm really excited about this. I am so excited

603
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:07,160
about the DS Wi-Fi. I hope this isn't just one of those things that's a good theory on

604
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:10,560
paper, but I really hope Nintendo doesn't let me down on this, but this is going to

605
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:15,060
bigger than I thought. I thought this was just gonna be Animal Crossing and Mario Kart,

606
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:16,060
but not the case.

607
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:21,120
Now, they have a lot of things announced for it, actually. The Nintendo Wi-Fi site actually

608
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:27,480
launched, by launched I mean there's a teaser page there now. So basically, if you go to

609
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:34,580
NintendoWifi.com and you check it out, their wonderful logo for it. The games that they're

610
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:40,620
seeing that are going to be utilizing the Wi-Fi. They have a huge list here. This is

611
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:46,600
only partial too. It's of course Animal Crossing, Bomberman, which is a surprise. I'm assuming

612
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,220
that's the Bomberman that came out already.

613
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:50,020
Maybe there's another one. I don't know.

614
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:55,560
There might be another one. I haven't heard of one. Castlevania DS, which that's coming

615
00:36:55,560 --> 00:37:02,820
out in a couple of days here. We have Contact, which I hope is not a game based on the really

616
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:03,820
crappy movie.

617
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:05,520
I somehow doubt it.

618
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:11,040
Digimon World, of course, you can probably make a DS version.

619
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:15,340
Dynasty Warriors DS, which I heard was actually pushed back to who knows when.

620
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:16,580
Some really good ones.

621
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:18,900
Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles DS, which is pretty cool.

622
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:22,660
I hope that's playable, that would be great.

623
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:24,580
Mario Kart DS, of course, no surprise.

624
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:28,860
Metro Prime Hunters, which isn't even coming out until next year.

625
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:33,620
Let's see here, Super Monkey Ball DS, which whoop-a-dee-doo.

626
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:38,840
Tony Hawk's American Skateland, which is the DS version of American Wasteland, but they

627
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:41,040
did their own specific version for it.

628
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:47,800
Topspin 2, Tenchu DS, then they have some generic card games, they have Ultimate Card

629
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:52,240
Games and Ultimate Brain Games, and then World Soccer Winnie 11 DS.

630
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,240
Cool.

631
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:58,960
For the Record, Contact is by Goichi Tsuda, who is the director of Capcom's Killer 7.

632
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,960
Oh, it's that game.

633
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,960
That's weird.

634
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:02,960
That's weird.

635
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,520
No, it shouldn't suck.

636
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:05,520
Good.

637
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,400
No Jodie Foster.

638
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:11,720
This isn't launching until November, but hey, that's when Mario Kart is coming out.

639
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:12,720
That's pretty exciting.

640
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:13,720
What's the website for that?

641
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:14,720
The teaser site?

642
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:15,720
Nintendo.com?

643
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:16,720
NintendoWifi.com.

644
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:17,720
NintendoWifi.com.

645
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:18,720
Check it out.

646
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:19,720
Okay.

647
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:20,720
Let's talk about...

648
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:24,040
I have some movie-related news.

649
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:26,920
I don't know why, but we seem to always talk about movies on this program.

650
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,680
I saw the trailer for this one.

651
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:29,680
What?

652
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:30,680
Actually, I didn't even...

653
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:32,340
What are you thinking?

654
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:33,340
This is Grandmaís Boy.

655
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:38,540
I didnít even realize the trailer was out already.

656
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:41,340
It is a brand new Adam Sandler movie thatís coming out now.

657
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:44,660
Why would we care here on a video game show about an Adam Sandler movie?

658
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:51,580
Because in the film, Grandmaís Boy, he plays a 36-year-old game tester and aspiring developer,

659
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:55,580
and itís about Adam Sandlerís stuff.

660
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:56,580
Itís funny.

661
00:38:56,580 --> 00:39:02,780
It's got the mom from Everybody Loves Raymond in it and she's funny, she just tortures

662
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:03,780
this guy.

663
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:05,460
It's really good.

664
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:11,760
But yeah, it does have game testers in it and it's supposedly the most accurate depiction

665
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:12,760
of game testers.

666
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,760
Well, you know what?

667
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:17,000
We're going to get some game testers on this show once the movie comes out to tell

668
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:21,540
us exactly what they think because we've got some contacts.

669
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:23,740
I know other than our usual people.

670
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:24,740
Well, yeah.

671
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:25,740
We've got a couple.

672
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:28,900
put it this way, it's an Adam Sandler film. It can't be too accurate to anything, so...

673
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:32,700
It should be interesting. Well, here's another one. This is a little more serious of a game

674
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:42,700
adaptation. Siren is going to be made into a live action film in Japan. Let's see, the

675
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:52,060
film is going to be directed by Sara Yoshihiko, who made Trick and Kizoku. I hope I pronounced

676
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:55,180
that right he's writing a treatment right now that's supposed to come out

677
00:39:55,180 --> 00:40:01,780
about February 11th when siren 2 comes out as well so it is being plotted right

678
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:05,660
now to come out a siren video game you know another franchise it's getting in

679
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:11,460
their own game or movie pretty soon God of War is being worked on right now

680
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:16,860
that's not a surprise adaptation but you know they're gonna cast like Vin Diesel

681
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:18,820
or The Rock for it.

682
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:24,100
You know what I saw finally on the big screen for the first time was that trailer for Doom,

683
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:25,580
which I hadn't seen yet.

684
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:26,580
Yeah.

685
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:29,700
I'm sorry, that first person thing?

686
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:30,700
Look hokey.

687
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:31,700
Yeah.

688
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:33,340
They're going to use that way too much.

689
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:38,660
I can understand, let's do that sequence for maybe 30 seconds of the movies to throw back

690
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:39,660
to the...

691
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:41,460
Yeah, you know what that reminds me of?

692
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:46,660
reminds me of what was the not not a house of the dead I think it was where

693
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:51,100
they had the gun so it is or whatever house of the dead yeah where they threw

694
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:56,460
in actual shots from the game worst zombie movie ever yeah thank you all

695
00:40:56,460 --> 00:41:00,980
right did you hear about PlayStation what's going on PlayStation doing an

696
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:05,380
Emmy an Emmy yeah was it one of those things that Ellen gave out on the awards

697
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:09,080
because I don't remember hearing about that ten years to the day after the

698
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:12,100
The original PlayStation went on sale in North America.

699
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:18,340
The console has been awarded an Emmy for outstanding achievement in technology and advanced new

700
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:19,340
media.

701
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:25,740
You know how they always do the tech awards that aren't good enough for TV?

702
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:27,620
The Oscars and the Emmys do that?

703
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:31,620
Yeah, the 57th Annual Technology and Engineering Emmy Awards.

704
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:34,400
That's not all that they've won.

705
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,620
What else did they win?

706
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:44,460
one banishment from the Vatican. I don't know if I consider that winning. No, but basically

707
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:50,120
Sony Italy has recently put up a full page advertisement depicting some guy wearing a

708
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:57,220
crown of thorns, much like Jesus. Except this guy had no beard and no mustache, right? Except

709
00:41:57,220 --> 00:42:02,480
this guy looks like he's a, I don't know, some... A nerd? Yeah, some nerd reject or

710
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:09,080
And he has a crown of thorns made up of the PlayStation symbols, the X circle, square

711
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:11,280
triangle stuff.

712
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:18,280
And then the subtitle to the whole article, which I love this, Ten Years of Passion.

713
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:22,260
Oh my gosh, wow.

714
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:24,720
How did that get by?

715
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,200
I don't think it did.

716
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:29,900
The Vatican took exception.

717
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:31,840
How did that get by at Sony though?

718
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:34,840
The entirety of Sega Corporate excommunicated now.

719
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:35,840
Wow, wow, wow.

720
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:38,840
Yeah, they've actually had it pulled out of the Vatican.

721
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:39,840
You think?

722
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:41,840
They executed their Vatican powers.

723
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,840
All right.

724
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:47,840
Moving on, we promised earlier in the show we'd get to some more of your emails, so if

725
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:52,840
you have an email for us, you can always send us one at togo, T-O-G-O, at orangelaunchradio.com.

726
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:57,840
And Dark Sakura's going to rip open the mailbag violently and salvage some letters to read

727
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:58,840
on air.

728
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:00,840
Dash, dash, ripped hair.

729
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:08,180
Xteen Bits sent us an email, a correction about Panorama Cotton stating that it's just

730
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:11,140
fairly uncommon and that there were several thousand.

731
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:15,460
I tend to exaggerate with that game because I have had no luck finding a copy for less

732
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:16,460
than $500.

733
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:19,020
I'm impressed somebody out there actually knew what the game was.

734
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:20,460
I sure as hell never heard of it.

735
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:21,460
Panorama Cotton is fun.

736
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:22,460
I never heard of it.

737
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:27,180
Although, it actually does give me sort of motion sickness and Rainbow Cotton didn't

738
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:32,180
which is really weird because usually it has to be the 3D game that makes me motion sick.

739
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:35,140
While we're on the subject of corrections, I actually have to correct something too because

740
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:36,140
I got an email about that.

741
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:37,140
Tsk, tsk.

742
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:41,220
I know. DJ Rama S. wants to know that the Miyamoto meet, which we talked about last

743
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:47,220
week, the article that I was referencing talked about that it was going to be the first 10

744
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:51,620
people would get to do bark mode with Miyamoto's dog, but unfortunately if you think about

745
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:55,660
the way bark mode works, there's no way you can restrict that to just being the first

746
00:43:55,660 --> 00:43:58,580
10 people in line that are going to be able to do it because Bark Mode is going to pick

747
00:43:58,580 --> 00:44:00,500
up on any DS that's within 100 feet.

748
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:05,860
So really it ended up being anybody that could get to Miyamoto's dog got to do Bark Mode

749
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:07,440
with Miyamoto's dog.

750
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:12,060
And so a lot of people outside actually ended up getting Miyamoto on their friends list,

751
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:13,660
which I think is just awesome.

752
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:17,460
Thank you DJ Ron Maest for sending in that correction.

753
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:23,100
Also one of our Canadian friends, Aceman, sent a question.

754
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:29,220
So I'm thinking about getting the 360 when it comes out on launch, but the thing is I don't know about the game selection

755
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:33,780
Like I know which ones I'm gonna get for myself Gears of War and Dead Rising

756
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:40,140
My question is are there any four player co-op games offline that you guys know of that I should pick up other than Ghost Recon?

757
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:47,100
First off I'd like to mention you might think of some better games to pick because Dead Rising and Gears of War are not coming

758
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:48,020
out of launch

759
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:49,020
Unfortunately.

760
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:50,020
Oh, ouch.

761
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:52,860
Yeah, Gears of War is to be announced right now.

762
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:55,740
Dead Rising has never even been on launch.

763
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:59,340
However, you've got a good selection of sports games.

764
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:04,100
If you're a sports fan, you have the entire 2K series and the EA series, you know, their

765
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:05,100
games.

766
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:08,420
If I may, I actually have the full list of launch titles in alphabet quarter.

767
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:10,140
All right, go for it.

768
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:14,860
Amped 3, Call of Duty, Condemned, which is Sega, I'm looking forward to that.

769
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:21,860
Federal Life 4, Elder Scrolls IV, Final Fantasy XI, Full Auto,

770
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:23,360
Final Fantasy XI is a launch title?

771
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:25,860
They are not launch titles. That list is wrong.

772
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:29,860
Well, I'm still going to read the list because these are either launch or near launch.

773
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:38,860
Full Auto, Ghost Recon, Advanced Warfighter, Gun, Cameo, Elements of Power, Madden NFL,

774
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:41,860
NBA 2K6, NHL 2K...blah, blah.

775
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:44,860
The Outfit, Perfect Dark.

776
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:50,860
Project Gotham Racing 3, Quake 4, Ridge Racer 6, Saints Row.

777
00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:53,860
Tony Hawk's American Wasteland, Top Spin 2.

778
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:58,860
Second Wave of Launch Titles, announced by EB as of November 16th.

779
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:04,860
Burnout Revenge, FIFA Soccer 06, Peter Jackson's King Kong.

780
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:12,860
By the way, speaking of that, they showed a scene of King Kong to the GameStop managers and it apparently is supposed to be very awesome.

781
00:46:12,860 --> 00:46:18,860
NBA Live 06, Need for Speed Most Wanted, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 06.

782
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:20,860
Perfect dark, isn't that a four player?

783
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:22,860
Let me correct that list real quick here.

784
00:46:22,860 --> 00:46:27,860
King Kong is coming day and date with the PlayStation 2, Xbox versions and GameCube versions.

785
00:46:27,860 --> 00:46:31,860
It's launching on every single platform the same day.

786
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:39,460
So, what else we have here? There was, I know Frame City Killer got pushed back to February,

787
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:44,540
which was one I was looking for. I know Saints Row isn't coming out until next year. Full

788
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:48,660
Auto is not coming out next year and I'm really disappointed about that. But, the ones

789
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:54,580
I was definitely going to pick up, Quake 4 looks good. Project Autumn Racing 3 is going

790
00:46:54,580 --> 00:47:00,560
to be friggin' awesome. Need for Speed, most wanted is coming out the week before

791
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:01,560
launch.

792
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:05,280
November 19th release date for Framed City Killer by Namco.

793
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:08,280
I got pushed back last week to February.

794
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:14,160
There's also an initial price list from EB that all the games will be $59.99, except

795
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:16,160
for Cameo, which is listed at $49.99.

796
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:19,440
There's some other ones that are $49.99, but yeah, Cameo is one of the cheaper ones.

797
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:23,840
I'm looking forward to Quake 4 and DOA 4, which is weird.

798
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:28,400
I'm usually not into DOA, but for some reason, I'm looking really forward to this new one.

799
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:32,040
We listed Halo 3 as being July 1, 2006.

800
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:36,420
They haven't even announced anything yet, so they're stating that they're presuming

801
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:40,740
it to be the same day as the PS3 release.

802
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:41,740
We got to keep it moving.

803
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:42,740
Any other emails?

804
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:43,740
Nope.

805
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:44,740
All right.

806
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:45,740
We're going to close the mail bag until next week.

807
00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:49,720
Send us some emails to go at orangelunchroider.com.

808
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:53,280
Castlevania will be going next gen.

809
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:55,560
It's already in development.

810
00:47:55,560 --> 00:48:01,480
Koji Igarashi has confirmed that the next gen entry will happen.

811
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:06,320
Honestly it shouldn't be a surprise to anybody, it's one of Konami's most successful series.

812
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:11,080
But one thing you might have been curious about is that the handheld releases will continue

813
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:15,880
to depict a different timeline, so the handheld releases will still be a little bit different.

814
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:24,240
Curse of Darkness, Dawn of Sorrow, why was I thinking about Curse of Darkness?

815
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:25,840
Game Boy Advance, I thought.

816
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:28,280
Is that a new game that's coming out that I didn't even know about?

817
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:31,600
Crystal Darkness is PlayStation 2 and Xbox. Remember the new one?

818
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:33,440
Yeah, I guess so. Is that coming out this year?

819
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:35,560
Yeah, it's coming out in October. Oh, no, wait.

820
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:36,040
How did I miss that?

821
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:36,680
November. I'm sorry.

822
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:39,400
Wow. Somehow I wouldn't completely miss that.

823
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:39,680
Yeah.

824
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:42,600
That's right. I remember seeing screenshots for that. I just haven't heard a lot about it lately.

825
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:43,840
For the first time, to the Xbox.

826
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:47,280
Interesting. So there will also be another game coming out for the next-gen systems.

827
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:51,640
Of course, we don't know which system and when, but it will be on its way.

828
00:48:51,640 --> 00:49:01,000
Moving on, let's talk about some stories that Loki has about Grand Theft Auto and a Grand

829
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,120
Theft Auto-like game.

830
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:08,200
First off, everybody's been waiting for the Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories, which

831
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:12,520
is going to be coming out for the PSP at the end of October.

832
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:17,760
One of the things that I have been wondering is, are they going to have some support for

833
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:18,760
Wi-Fi?

834
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:19,760
We haven't really heard anything.

835
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:24,440
answer is yes they are. They will actually feature a few different modes

836
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:31,200
multiplayer for up to six different players and it will basically have two

837
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:35,080
that have been released so far. They said about seven modes. The first one being

838
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:39,480
Liberty City Survivor which is your basic deathmatch style gameplay and

839
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:45,200
Protection Racket which splits players into teams which they must protect or

840
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:51,580
or destroy a number of different limousines at bases somewhere in the city. They're basically

841
00:49:51,580 --> 00:49:57,960
saying that multiplayer mode will be identical to single player, but you'll have more vehicles

842
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:00,800
available up front and 60 different player skins.

843
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:01,800
Awesome.

844
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:09,740
Plus, of course, power-ups and the standard hoo-ha there. Now, of course, Microsoft can't

845
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:15,000
be out of any sort of franchise, so their supposed answer to the Grand Theft Auto series

846
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:23,200
is a game which, I don't know, it looks okay, but it's basically a Grand Theft Auto-ish

847
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:29,680
type game with kind of a superhero character. It's Crackdown, and you're basically a super

848
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:35,880
human guy who's basically cleaning up the city, and by cleaning up the city, you can

849
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:44,180
steal cars, throw cars at people, just really interesting stuff. I don't know. It doesn't

850
00:50:44,180 --> 00:50:49,440
look that great to me. The screenshots I saw, I was like, who gives a crap? I'll pick

851
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:54,600
it up because it'll be fun to play. I like throwing cards at people. But, it doesn't

852
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:59,360
look that impressive. Especially looking at the other games coming out, it just looks

853
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:06,640
like a third party release. It's just not really good. But, hey, beta shots, who knows?

854
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:10,440
Just a couple more stories then. We've got just a couple more here. One thing I want

855
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:15,280
talk about is the Mana series. Of course, Secret of Mana, Legend of Mana, all that stuff.

856
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:18,800
We have Children of Mana, it's actually an RPG that's in development right now. It's

857
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:23,920
going to be coming out for the Nintendo DS. That was confirmed in Famitsu Weekly Magazine

858
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:29,440
this week. Don't know how it's taken advantage of having the two screens and the touch thing.

859
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:33,040
All we know is that it's happening, Children of Mana. I just hope it's better than Legend

860
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:37,480
of Mana because I could not, Legend of Mana ruined the series for me. I couldn't stand

861
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:39,160
it. That PlayStation one was awful.

862
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:44,080
My problem with Legend of Mana was the fact that I imported it in a fit of, ooh, Mana

863
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:45,080
game!

864
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:47,560
I like, I'm going to make this bold statement, I'll probably get Haymail for it.

865
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:48,920
It was uber text heavy.

866
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:52,560
I liked Secret of Evermore more than I liked Legend of Mana.

867
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:53,560
Ooh!

868
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:54,560
I know.

869
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:55,560
That's a pretty bold statement, I realize.

870
00:51:55,560 --> 00:52:00,000
Legend of Mana was pretty, but I didn't read enough Japanese at the time to be able to

871
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,440
effectively play it.

872
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:06,400
Now, one of the games in the Mana series that a lot of people love is Second Detsetsu 3,

873
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:08,280
which of course never made its way over here.

874
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:13,560
Well, Second Densetsu 4 is in development, but we don't know which system, and we don't

875
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:15,040
know really anything else about it.

876
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:16,520
We just know it's happening.

877
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:20,480
Neither one of these games, I should point out, is World of Mana, which was that thing

878
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:23,280
they teased at E3 this year with, like, a big movie.

879
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:24,560
Who knows what the heck that is?

880
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:27,720
I have a hunch it's an MMO, but I could be wrong.

881
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:28,720
I think it's an MMO.

882
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:32,260
I think when you call something world, I have a hunch it's an MMO, but we don't know.

883
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:34,600
We just don't know.

884
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:41,760
story tonight, guys. Katamari Craze is spreading the nation, of course, and if you want to

885
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:48,420
check out Namco's website, katamari.namco.com, if you sign up for the website, you can actually

886
00:52:48,420 --> 00:52:53,900
download your own little version of The Prince, who will roll a katamari across your screen

887
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:59,100
at various intervals, and will play little looping music, and of course, you can actually

888
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:02,120
click and drag him and throw him places and all that stuff.

889
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:04,660
I used to have a goat that did that.

890
00:53:04,660 --> 00:53:09,660
I guess this would be fun for about five minutes and then get as annoying as those little purple

891
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:10,660
bonsai buddies.

892
00:53:10,660 --> 00:53:12,660
Thirty seconds, actually.

893
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:13,660
Really?

894
00:53:13,660 --> 00:53:14,660
Thirty seconds.

895
00:53:14,660 --> 00:53:15,660
Did you try this?

896
00:53:15,660 --> 00:53:16,660
Yes, I did.

897
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:22,500
It replays the whole thing over and over and he just rolls the thing all over the screen,

898
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:24,700
basically back and forth, back and forth, back and forth.

899
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:26,020
Does he pick up your windows?

900
00:53:26,020 --> 00:53:29,940
I thought he would and I thought that would be awesome because I have a lot of icons he

901
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:34,940
he could roll up, but he did not, and it was a great disappointment.

902
00:53:34,940 --> 00:53:40,340
We'll just have to send a message to the King of Cosmos for somebody to shoot some

903
00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:43,660
freaking laser beams out of their eyes at Namco.

904
00:53:43,660 --> 00:53:48,020
That just makes me really miss the little goat, because the little goat would occasionally

905
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:49,020
run off to get the lucky.

906
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:50,700
I've got a few last minute stories here.

907
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:51,700
What's up?

908
00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:52,700
A couple of ones.

909
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:54,160
First off, there's going to be a new Resident Evil.

910
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:56,580
This one's coming out for the DS, actually.

911
00:53:56,580 --> 00:54:04,900
Resident Evil deadly science, ha ha, DS, oh my gosh, you people and naming your franchises,

912
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:07,420
anything that will work with the DS acronym.

913
00:54:07,420 --> 00:54:11,620
So basically Resident Evil for DS, nothing more to see here, move along, anyways, the

914
00:54:11,620 --> 00:54:19,020
other thing is in November, they're going to be bundling the red DS with Mario Kart

915
00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:27,580
for the price of $1.49, much like you have seen with the Nintendogs, so yippee, skippy.

916
00:54:27,580 --> 00:54:34,100
The Red DS is already available for import. Some info about Zelda. Basically, you know

917
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:38,220
how Twilight Princess was supposed to come out this year? Yeah, and it's not, and they

918
00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:43,180
were adding new features. Well, you know what those features are? It's basically going to

919
00:54:43,180 --> 00:54:48,980
be enhanced for the Nintendo Revolution. They're going to be adding, if you plug in your game

920
00:54:48,980 --> 00:54:52,680
cube game to the revolution you'll be able to use the wonderful revolution controller

921
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:58,940
for god knows what, but that's basically why it's been pushed back. I was hoping that you'd

922
00:54:58,940 --> 00:55:01,880
put it on the same system, but they're not.

923
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:04,180
I just think honestly they should have just done it for the revolution.

924
00:55:04,180 --> 00:55:08,800
The best description of that controller is on VG Cats.

925
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:10,640
What's that?

926
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:13,480
Basically the reaction is, I feel dirty.

927
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:15,000
And the last story.

928
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,400
You promise?

929
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:24,480
I promise. The last story is Kojima clarifies that the No Place to Hide in the trailer that

930
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:30,180
we saw from Metal Gear Solid 4 is about Snake's age. Basically, this doesn't take no place

931
00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:39,620
to hide from death. Basically, because he is a clone of Big Boss, this is only a few

932
00:55:39,620 --> 00:55:44,100
years later after number two so or three I guess and whatever no number two

933
00:55:44,100 --> 00:55:50,120
because three took place before two anyways I've gone cross-eyed anyway so

934
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:53,560
they haven't really said too much else other than there's gonna be two

935
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:59,980
different sides that you can either ally with still a little snatcher but it

936
00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:03,580
looks sexy I still need to get into Metal Gear Solid I honestly though

937
00:56:03,580 --> 00:56:08,620
another there's a fun parody of that on VG cats also their most recent comic

938
00:56:08,620 --> 00:56:12,660
it's really a solid state any money under the table or something no I just

939
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:15,260
love that I just thought that that's like my favorite webcomic I'll spam

940
00:56:15,260 --> 00:56:19,620
amusement all the way okay video game related webcomics spam use but I have

941
00:56:19,620 --> 00:56:24,020
sizzling makes me crack up like crazy all right anyway that's it that's it
