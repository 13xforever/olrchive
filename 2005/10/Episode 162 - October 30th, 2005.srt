00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:28,840
ASMR

2
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:17,020

The following program is intended for mature audiences.

4
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:27,560
Good evening, everybody out there on the interweb.

5
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:31,720
listening to Orange Lounge Radio. We're about ready to kick off tonight's program.

6
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:36,760
Happy Halloween, you weenies! We're gonna be talking tonight about Ultramix 3.

7
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:44,600
Extrofer is gonna review a snuff film on tonight's show, and I don't know, whatever else

8
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:49,840
tickles our fancies. Dark Soccer was out for last week, so she's gonna

9
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:55,640
tell you all about her week off. Is your mic on? It is now. There we go. I had to go

10
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,640
We're going to talk about field trips.

11
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,640
It sucks!

12
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,640
We're going to reminisce about good old times.

13
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,640
But first, a brief introduction.

00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:12,640
Orange Lounge Radio is presented in the TMI sound format.

15
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,640
Oh

00:03:37,640 --> 00:04:04,480
Oh, God, hey, hey, hey, call me Daddy

17
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:14,480

18
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:21,480
Orange Lounge may contain a scene of beauty. Orange Lounge may contain plenty of...

19
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:29,480
Just kidding, Orange Lounge Radio will not contain any of that. In this episode...

20
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,480
Well, isn't that special?

21

29
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:31,700
co-hosts in this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm, is Stark Sakura.

30
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:32,700
Jamie Summers.

31
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:33,700
That was lovely.

32
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:34,700
Tasted like burrito.

33
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:35,700
It tastes like burning.

34
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:36,700
No, it tasted like burrito.

35
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:37,700
You know what's funny?

36
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:44,140
I think your mic faded out, like right at the point where you burped, so it didn't pick

37
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:45,700
it up even, which is great.

38
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:46,700
Burp!

39
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,700
There you go.

40
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,700
Also with us tonight, say hello to Tech Masuloki.

41
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:51,700
Hi.

42
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:52,700
How you doing?

43
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:58,140
But you seem a little withdrawn tonight giving me one word answers. I don't know

44
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:02,820
I just haven't gotten into this show yet. Are you are you committed to this program? Yes

45
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:07,580
You better be all right also with us tonight. Say hello to

46
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:11,500
The crazy the delusional, but it's very funny extrovert

47
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:17,900
Yo, yo, how you doing extrovert? I'm doing great with a side of good

48
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:18,900
Good.

49
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,900
That's wonderful to hear.

50
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:24,900
Also with us tonight, say hello to Ms. DDR Angel.

51
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:25,900
Hello.

52
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:26,900
How you doing?

53
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:27,900
I'm good.

54
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:33,900
Yeah, I've got a lot of stuff to talk about, but I guess we can talk about that later.

55
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:37,900
As I have news about said convention from this weekend.

56
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:38,900
Hint.

57
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:39,900
Elbow.

58
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:40,900
Hint.

59
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:41,900
Did you go to Blizzcon?

60
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:42,900
No, I didn't.

61
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:43,900
I know a lot of news about it.

62
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:44,900
I was like, the fuck?

63
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,900
We had representation at Blizzcon?

64
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:55,900
Um, sort of. I kind of had my ends as far as finding out about stuff, even though I wasn't there. Does that make sense?

65
00:06:55,900 --> 00:07:04,900
Okay, I gotcha. I'll talk about my relationship with Blizzard Entertainment in a little while. We'll talk about that when we come back. How's that sound?

66
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:08,900
Sure. No, that's fine. I just wanted to, you know, get out there.

67
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:15,900
I love Blizzard now, which is ironic because I used to think they were so overrated, but ever since I started playing World of Warcraft, I can't fucking stop.

68
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:20,580
and then i would like to know how to get a blue and i don't know if they will not

69
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:23,260
tell you what i've ran laughter

70
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:25,140
fifteen years ago

71
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:27,740
that you know i'm not

72
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:30,300
the public rocket

73
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,520
yet but this really big interesting

74
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:36,420
uh... it was in the end isn't that that new movie like you monday

75
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:37,760
you know

76
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:44,060
uh... or that the medication you take with your depressed that that a lot

77
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:48,060
Anyway, I have a lot of news about that. We can talk about that when we get back.

78
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:52,060
Other than that, I've probably got some other stuff.

79
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:56,060
Well good, I'm glad someone's on task tonight, because I have really nothing. I was just going to wing it for three hours.

80
00:07:56,060 --> 00:08:02,060
I don't know about DarkSakura and Loki, but I can already tell Loki's kind of distance from the show.

81
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:05,060
Anyway, yeah, hi.

82
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:11,060
And DarkSakura, I don't even know if what she's got on the screen is related to the show.

83
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:18,060
I'm looking at Playgirl models.

84
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:21,060
Let's go to a break, kids. We'll be back after this with more...

85
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:23,060
I'm looking at naked Darryl Hannah.

86
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:28,060
Oh, sorry. I'm actually going to be ordering Clan of the Cave Bear.

87
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:29,060
You guys are so weird.

88
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:30,060
And Iguana Girl says hi.

89
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:32,060
Oh, right on. Hey.

90
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:35,060
Is her people very gray and wiry?

91
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:36,060
What?

92
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:37,060
Darryl Hannah.

93
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:38,060
I don't know it.

94
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:41,060
Oh, I thought you were talking about Iguana Girl. I was like, what?

95
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:44,060
Oh, no, no, no, no. I was talking about Daryl Hannah.

96
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:48,060
But it's Iguana Girls. No, I'm kidding.

97
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:52,060
On that note, let's go to a break.

98
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:55,060
And we'll be back after this. And we might actually talk about some music game stuff.

99
00:08:55,060 --> 00:09:00,060
Because apparently Ultra Mix 3, the song list released, and there's a concert coming to town,

100
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:02,060
and all this other garbage I want to talk about too.

101
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:05,060
We'll be back after this. Oh, join our chat room, won't you?

102
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:12,060
click on chat. We'll start it off this break with a little bit of Taku from 2DX4 style. Enjoy.

103
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:16,080
Long live the

104
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:50,080
Johnny wanted to you

105
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,080
Ready, steady, go!

106
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,080
Ready, steady, go!

107
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,080
Lyrical style of my blow, yo

108
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,080
Yo, ready

109
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,080
Ready

110
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,080
Lyrical style of my blow, yo

111
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,080
Ready, steady, go!

112
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,080
Strictly the motherfucker

113
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:14,080
I'm ready, steady, go I'm ready, steady, go

114
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:44,080
Gaming radio, so uncensored, that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.

115
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,080
Uh, Mooch, uh, Moo-kaw-key.

116
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,080
Orange Lounge Radio.

117
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,080
Taxcon.

118
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,080
Hi, we're here.

119
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,080
I like Doritos, Rob.

120
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,080
Do you? That's good to hear.

121
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,080
It sounds like it. I mean, literally.

122
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,080
It smells like it, too.

123
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,080
We all know.

124
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:08,080
Oh, that mic's getting retired before the end of the night. I don't know what the fuck's going on with it.

125
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:11,080
Hi! This microphone sucks a big chunk of ass.

126
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,080
Oh, that's what it is.

127
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,080
Do you want me to pick up a new mic?

128
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,080
Are you going to Target?

129
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,080
And you can reimburse me?

130
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,080
F yes. Go to Target and get a new mic.

131
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,080
Okay.

132
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,080
That's awesome.

133
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,080
I'm so awesome, aren't I?

134
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,080
You're okay.

135
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,080
Aww.

136
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,080
Alright, so we'll get that fixed.

137
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:31,080
Good, that means that'll be fixed before the podcast. That makes me happy.

138
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,080
So anyway.

139
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,080
Wow, that kind of threw me.

140
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:39,100
I just think it would be really funny if one day we were at a break and then we just didn't

141
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,100
come back.

142
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:43,440
You just kind of hear the music in the background and we're not there.

143
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,280
Actually, maybe we already pulled that prank.

144
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,280
I don't know.

145
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,280
Anyway, hi.

146
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,400
You're listening to Orange Andrea.

147
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,400
We are here.

148
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,400
We are live.

149
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:54,400
I noticed, just judging from the names I see in chat room, we have quite a few people tonight

150
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,420
who haven't listened before.

151
00:16:56,420 --> 00:17:00,560
And judging from what's been going on in general in the past 10 months, we have more and more

152
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,620
people listening to us thanks to our podcast, which I think, you know, that's awesome. That's

153
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:07,580
the whole idea. We did a podcast in the first place. It's because we were like, oh, maybe

154
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:10,920
we'll get like two or three people listening to the podcast that'll come over and then

155
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:15,720
listen to our live show. And then the fucking podcast gets like 40 times the listeners our

156
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:20,040
live show gets. It's crazy. But it's cool. No, we love it. We love the fact that, you

157
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:25,960
know, people are listening to it and just loving it. But I do, I do got to warn people,

158
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:29,640
the live show's not really like the podcast. Because the podcast, you know, we're sitting

159
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:32,480
around, we're talking about games, we're letting you know about, you know, what video games

160
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,920
are coming out, and we're just the news, we're telling you guys the news and what's going

161
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:40,520
on and giving you our big fat opinions and all that, but this three hour show, well,

162
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:44,480
it's about the music-based video games, supposedly, I mean, that's, you know, the ideas that we

163
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:51,040
talk about DDR and 2DX, but, I mean, let's face it, if you look at the DDR scene in general,

164
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,880
what's happened to the DDR Freak boards?

165
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:57,160
It's like this, it's like, we're dedicated, this show is dedicated to music games like

166
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,000
MTV is dedicated to music.

167
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,280
Yes, that's a great analogy. We are the MTV of music gaming.

168
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:07,480
I can't really say anything too bad about the DDR Freak boards, though.

169
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:10,400
No, I'm not saying a negative thing. No, no, no, no. Not just because I moderate

170
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,400
there. Right.

171
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,960
But because I've seen worse. Oh, yeah. No, no. I'm not saying anything.

172
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,080
I mean, if I wanted to say something negative about the DDR Freak boards, I'd go to a different

173
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,680
topic. But the DDR Freak boards in general, if you

174
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:25,960
notice where the majority of posts are, well, maybe not the majority, but the real active

175
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:32,900
users and the long-time users all kind of flock to one forum, random chat.

176
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:35,700
So we are the random chat of the internet. I don't know.

177
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:45,700
Random chat lately is the bane of my existence. Anyway, that is a great analogy. I'm sorry,

178
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:52,820
that was great. We're like MTV is to music. Anyway, oh, even the chat room agrees. Loki

179
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:57,500
he wins the show says uh... in bq good job people are still in the same way

180
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:01,380
g_-four has nothing to do it in the g_-four is is um...

181
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,140
young man television and

182
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:06,100
at the stretch of that i'm confused by g_-four

183
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:10,000
they confuse me a first up why they play fast lane cuz

184
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,460
at show shouldn't be on erin any station

185
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:15,520
or remember that one episode of a play bdr in it

186
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,940
all i get that probably tied up with the video game and i still want to be there

187
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:22,080
you know put on station

188
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,080
sounds good to me

189
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:26,080
well maybe they'll put on like you know will and grace now on that show because

190
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,620
you know they play DDR in one episode

191
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:32,820
that's like that logo channel playing wonder falls

192
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:36,240
you know just because there was a lesbian couple in wonder falls they put

193
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,500
on the whole show

194
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:41,160
logo by the way being the gay lesbian I'm sorry for all of you

195
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:45,480
people that don't like to be fucked up the ass

196
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,000
logos for gay people

197
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,200
What does it, it doesn't, my, my mother watches Logo.

198
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,400
Oh, it's not just for Gabe, it's about Gabe.

199
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,600
Some people don't have cable.

200
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,600
Oh, well, Logo...

201
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,600
Some people have to live with core TV.

202
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,200
So it's like Bravo?

203
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,200
Psychic detectives.

204
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:07,800
No, Bravo, Bravo is somehow gayer than Logo still.

205
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,400
I mean, honestly, fucking A.

206
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:13,800
Project Runway is like the equivalent of an all-male gangbang.

207
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:18,200
I don't know if you've ever watched this show, Project Runway.

208
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,720
It's gay.

209
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:25,880
It's like ten Madonna videos, all back to back is what Project Runway is, it is gay.

210
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:31,520
Every guy on that show is gay, it's gay, gay, gay-y, gay.

211
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:35,360
But since I'm gay I can say that because it's like that episode of South Park where Mr.

212
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:39,760
Garrison goes around and calls everybody a fag because he's gay, that's where I can get

213
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:48,320
away saying that too. Anyway, we should start a show. Usually we like to start the show

214
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:52,240
by playing a little bit of How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day, where we go around and find

215
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:56,840
out from everybody, how was your week, how was your day, because not only do we not really

216
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:00,920
talk about DER, even though we claim that's what our show's about, but the show, if you

217
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:06,280
think about what the show is really, really about at its core, it's about us and our lives.

218
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,880
about stoking the ego.

219
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:08,880
That's exactly right.

220
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,200
So, uh, DarkSakura, if your microphone will cooperate with you through this segment, how

221
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,200
was your week, how was your day?

222
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:17,680
Well, actually, how was the past two weeks?

223
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,680
That's true.

224
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,680
Excuse me.

225
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:23,720
I ate a burrito, and burritos make me burp.

226
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:26,720
I'm also drinking TAB.

227
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,720
TAB is like the ultimate drink of me.

228
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:31,400
Why the fuck are you voluntarily drinking TAB?

229
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:34,640
Because the 80s are making a comeback and not in a good way.

230
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:41,520
if I if I was on like survivor and they offered tab and a reward challenge I'd

231
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:46,400
be all fuck you I'll starve seriously I'll drink sand thank you I would

232
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:52,680
honestly rather drink ocean water that all the fish have crapped in the tap

233
00:21:52,680 --> 00:22:01,360
but the tab is tabulous fantabulous you know tab backwards is bad and that's

234
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,120
That's exactly what it tastes like, blended bat.

235
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,120
Rob.

236
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,120
What?

237
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,120
Dear.

238
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,120
Yes.

239
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,120
Your analogy sucked ass.

240
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,120
I know.

241
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,440
I'm trying to compete with Loki tonight in the analogy department.

242
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:21,000
I just got an I.M. that says you're drinking tab.

243
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Yes.

244
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
That's right.

245
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
You get her.

246
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
That's almost as bad.

247
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
What was that?

248
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Tang or?

249
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,660
by the Tang or...

250
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:31,720
Did you get the astronauts took to the moon?

251
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:37,680
Notice how Tab was conspicuously left out of all three

252
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:41,080
I love the 80's series on VH1. You know why?

253
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:45,200
Because no one loved Tab. No one loved Tab at all.

254
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:51,000
I love Tab. It tastes like gross but I like it. You know what's sad is I woke up this morning...

255
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,780
I woke up this morning... Hey!

256
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:54,000
What about my week?

257
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,240
Well, we were on the tangent of I Love the 80s, so I was saying, I woke up this morning

258
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:03,920
and I was wondering, how long after it becomes, you know, 2011 will it take VH1 to make the

259
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:06,440
I Love 2000?

260
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,440
I was just like...

261
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,440
Well, we already have it.

262
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,800
It's that show, Best Week Ever.

263
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:13,520
I don't know if you've watched Best Week Ever, but it's basically I Love the Last Week.

264
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,760
It's the premise of the show.

265
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,760
I Love the Last Week.

266
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:20,440
But you know the drink that we need to have come back besides Crystal Pepsi and Josta?

267
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:23,600
Because Josta was the drink, and Serge...

268
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:29,200
If you say, if you say Pepsi Blue, I'm leaving the show, because I cannot stand Pepsi Blue.

269
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,200
It is so blue, too.

270
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,200
Pepsi Blue.

271
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:36,760
But Tab makes me think of Back to the Future, where he goes into the bar, into the little

272
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,920
diner and says, give me a tab.

273
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,200
You haven't ordered anything yet.

274
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,200
You can't have a tab.

275
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,200
Okay.

276
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,200
Then a Pepsi Free.

277
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,360
Look, if you're going to get, have a Pepsi, you have to pay for it.

278
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,480
Ha ha.

279
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,080
The only thing I can think of that's worse than TAB is Pepsi Blue.

280
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,080
Nasty.

281
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:58,080
Like, if that were the reward on Survivor, I'd swish it and spit it at the host.

282
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,080
This is not awful.

283
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,080
Pepsi Blue is god-awful.

284
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,080
Dr. Pepper.

285
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,080
Isn't it?

286
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,080
Doesn't the vanilla Dr. Pepper?

287
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,080
Ew!

288
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,080
Ew!

289
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:07,680
The Cherry Vanilla Dr. Pepper is the nastiest shit ever.

290
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,680
Okay.

291
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:15,800
I don't know when we started becoming the soft drink show, but I have to say this.

292
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:19,780
This friend of mine made the best analogy about that diet Cherry Vanilla Dr. Pepper.

293
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:23,220
It doesn't taste like cherry, and it doesn't taste like vanilla, and it really doesn't

294
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:25,020
taste like Dr. Pepper.

295
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:28,560
I don't know what that's supposed to be.

296
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:32,540
It's like all three of the flavors cancel each other out, and suddenly you've got like

297
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:33,540
TAB.

298
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:34,540
Anyway.

299
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:38,260
Raj just told me that Blue Pepsi tasted like medicine.

300
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:40,580
I would rather drink a bottle of DayQuil.

301
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:42,200
I said it looked like a toilet bowl.

302
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,420
I liked Blue Pepsi.

303
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:44,420
Oh my God.

304
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:45,420
Am I weird?

305
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:46,420
Go kill yourself.

306
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:47,420
Okay.

307
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:56,260
was eventful. I got to stay on a bus and go to San Francisco on a bus for my

308
00:24:56,260 --> 00:25:02,060
field trip last Sunday and I just sort of played with my puppies on the way and

309
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:07,100
ignored the teacher. But he was giving us a history of different locations on the

310
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:10,980
way in San Francisco and everything and it was kind of cool. Wait a minute, wait a

311
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:15,820
minute. But we hardly got out of the bus. Hold up, hold up. The last time I went on a

312
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:22,380
a field trip. I was in the 11th grade. I did not know that they did field trips in college.

313
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:25,700
What? What? I've never... They also do camping trips for like single

314
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:29,080
credits and everything. The hell?

315
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:32,020
If you can take bowling as a sport, they have field trips.

316
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:35,980
This is for cultural geography. So we went over the different settlements and we went

317
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:41,140
by the first mission in San Francisco. And we also, though, went by... This is my favorite

318
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:45,580
place and I've always wanted to get out and go there. It's by the Exploratorium.

319
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:49,960
The Palace of Fine Art that was there since the World's Fair in 1915.

320
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:54,000
The last standing structure from the World's Fair in 1915.

321
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,440
And just listening to how most of San Francisco is built on landfill.

322
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,800
Like oh, we have an earthquake, let's just use all this crap to fill up a lake and build

323
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:07,800
houses on it. Without any real engineering, really makes me want to live in San Francisco.

324
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:08,800
Yeah, right.

325
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,800
Right.

326
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:10,800
Did you go to the Exploratorium also?

327
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:11,800
No, we didn't.

328
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,800
Oh.

329
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,800
We used their bathroom twice.

330
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,800
Oh.

331
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:15,800
I like the Exploratorium.

332
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,800
I do, too.

333
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,800
Yeah.

334
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:20,720
I liked it at the very, very back where nobody really went, and you know how you have that

335
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:25,620
big screen where if you dance in front of it, you can see yourself like a silhouette

336
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:28,960
of yourself on the screen dancing, and it changes all sorts of colors.

337
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:29,960
You know what I'm talking about?

338
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:30,960
They have a place like that in Mobile.

339
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:31,960
It's actually just called the Explorium.

340
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:32,960
Oh, really?

341
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,600
It's in downtown Mobile built out of, I think, the old city hall, but they have a screen

342
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,600
like that.

343
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,600
It was great.

344
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:46,160
They still have animatronic dinosaurs there too.

345
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:49,480
So on the way back on the field trip, did you guys sing songs on the bus?

346
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:53,120
Found a peanut, found a peanut, found a peanut.

347
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,120
Actually, no.

348
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:58,480
This is the first time in my life, normally if you go look at the Golden Gate, if it's

349
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:02,120
foggy you can still see the top of the tallest bit of it.

350
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,760
It was completely engulfed in fog this time.

351
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:05,760
Completely.

352
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,760
I took pictures. I can put them somewhere for people, I guess.

353
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:13,760
But yeah, that's what I did on Sunday. The rest of my week has just been

354
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:17,760
working school and going to the chiropractor. My

355
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:21,760
insurance paid for me one of those exercise balls.

356
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:25,760
So I've been using it.

357
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:29,760
My husband's going on South Beach next week, so I'm going back

358
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,760
to phase one on it with him. So you're going to be hearing me next week going,

359
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:39,800
hungry I need a burrito I'll be sitting here eating Pizza Hut mmm actually I can

360
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:43,240
eat California Pizza Kitchen Tanya because they don't bleach their flour

361
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:51,600
that's some good stuff I respect you but um but and at any rate it's like I was

362
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:57,240
so worn out that day that when we got onto the Bay Bridge to go back I opened

363
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:08,400
my eyes again in Vallejo so yeah I was pretty much dead and really the rest of

364
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:13,840
my week has just been crap well we did watch Batman Begins again and I sprained

365
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:25,480
my wrist. Wait a minute how did you sprain your wrist watching Batman Begins? I was drinking and I got up off the floor.

366
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:28,680
Christian Bale do it for you?

367
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:31,320
Well actually, in that movie, yeah.

368
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:38,040
But no, I was getting up off the floor and I pushed my hand down and hyper-extended my wrist.

369
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:42,160
Were you going to show them the bat cave?

370
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:46,280
Listeners, I'm going to give you a play-by-play of me winding up this

371
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,920
game from Chipotle and

372
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:50,360
throwing it at Robin, hitting him in the face.

373
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:54,080
Which I just did.

374
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,080
Naughty naughty boy!

375
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:28,080
I was gonna play a video game, but, uh, yeah. I wanna go eat instead.

376
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,080
Well, it was good.

377
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:34,080
And, um, we ended up, we were gonna watch, uh, Dan was watching The Job.

378
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:38,080
It has Dennis Leary. I hate that show, but I love Dennis Leary.

379
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:42,080
I, like, I loathe just about every character on that show.

380
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:47,080
The last thing that I liked that I loathed every character on was, like, Chicago.

381
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,080
But that's it.

382
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:54,080
I'm done since you've not wasted all my time talking about stuff.

383
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:57,080
You know you love it. That's what we do.

384
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,080
Oh, baby.

385
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,080
Loki, how was your week? How was your day?

386
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:05,080
Well, my week was weird, and my day was weird.

387
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:09,080
The entire week was filled up with two things, and it's really strange.

388
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:15,080
Myself playing the game The Warriors and watching the first season of Desperate Housewives.

389
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:21,080
and I don't know how those two combined but that's I don't get it dude you

390
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:24,220
actually sat through the whole first season of Desperate Housewives not

391
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:28,020
voluntarily Nellie was watching Desperate Housewives I was programming the

392
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:32,520
web page so I think in a sense I did sit through the whole you know first season

393
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:39,880
of Desperate Housewives I don't know it's I have breaking news what I just

394
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:44,280
found two dollars in my pocket congratulations that's your payment for

395
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:49,620
doing this show for the past three and a half years someone actually sent me a

396
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:55,440
dollar you know how in the intro it says give her a dollar yeah someone actually

397
00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:02,740
mailed me a dollar you gave somebody your address anyway okay listening to

398
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:07,380
this show and he mailed me a dollar awesome dude we're gonna be rich doing

399
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:10,980
this program get all the listeners to send us a dollar then we'd have like

400
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:44,820
can identify with. You know, they have the four different type of women and stuff like

401
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:52,420
that. So, I don't know. It's not a bad show. It's well-written, I guess, but not exactly

402
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:58,980
something that, you know, most heterosexual males would be caught dead watching. You know,

403
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:04,660
I don't know. It had, for me, it had the same feel as, like, Dead Like Me and Wonder Falls.

404
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:07,580
You know, the same type of thing, where each show has, like, a theme to it, that type of

405
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:08,580
thing.

406
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:10,580
And if we're missing out, those two shows are great.

407
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:15,580
So, hey, that's what it... I mean, I've got the DVD set, got it for free, thank God, I didn't pay for it.

408
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:20,580
So yeah, guess what's up next? I have to watch season one of Lost now.

409
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:23,580
I really don't want to sit through that, so, but, whatever.

410
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:28,580
Anyways, um, so yeah, it's been that, working on the webpage, playing the Warriors,

411
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:33,580
and not getting to play any other games I wanted to play because, you know, the TV's being taken up.

412
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:37,580
So, what did you, um, do for the website?

413
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:47,580
I created a wonderful kick-ass shoutbox for our PSP site with a nice virtual keyboard on there and everything. It looks pretty.

414
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:56,580
Yeah, so you can go there and give us a shoutout over on OLRPSP.com, but again, that website is really for viewing on your PSP.

415
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:59,580
It'll work in a normal browser, but it looks ugly.

416
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:01,580
It doesn't look as pretty, let's put it that way.

417
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:07,580
It is still pretty, but it's prettier if you look at it on a PSP, because it's made for the PSP.

418
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:11,580
In fact, it looks better than our regular website, I gotta say.

419
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:13,580
Oh well.

420
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:15,580
That's alright, what can you do?

421
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:18,580
But yeah, that's pretty much what I've been doing this week.

422
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:25,580
Just lots of work, and trying to put some video games in there.

423
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:28,580
Play Grand Theft Auto Liberty Sea Stories for all five minutes.

424
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:31,580
It's about all the attention that I can dedicate to that game.

425
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:32,580
Is it that bad?

426
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:34,580
No, I just can't dedicate enough attention to the game.

427
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:35,580
Too busy watching Desperate Housewives?

428
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:36,580
I'm too busy doing every-

429
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:37,580
Too bad?

430
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:38,580
Like, tons of stuff.

431
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:39,580
And, I don't know.

432
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:43,580
Liberty City Stories, it's like, I don't even have time for most of the stuff on the PSP,

433
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:46,580
so, I don't know.

434
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:48,580
It'll be fun playing multiplayer, though.

435
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:49,580
Alright, I'm done.

436
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:50,580
Alright.

437
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:53,580
Uh, I guess I'll talk about my week real fast, then we'll get to our guests,

438
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:54,580
and they can talk about their week.

439
00:33:54,580 --> 00:34:02,580
My week was okay. It was actually really busy, because I had an awful lot of work stuff this week, and I was even there one night until like 7 o'clock, and that's just sad.

440
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:08,580
So I haven't really gotten a chance to do a whole lot else. I did buy some new games, and I'll talk about those on this week's podcast.

441
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:15,580
Soul Calibur 3 I've been playing an awful lot of, as well as Midway Arcade Treasures 3, which Loki gave me last week.

442
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:21,580
And I started playing Taito, but I'm going to save that for the week after podcast, because I didn't get to play it really enough.

443
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:26,860
really enough so I'm gonna talk about those games and not a whole lot else

444
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:32,080
really you know I didn't do a lot for Halloween which is kind of even though

445
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:35,180
Halloween's technically tomorrow I've really done a lot for Halloween which is

446
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:38,980
kind of too bad except playing World of Warcraft and trick-or-treating inside

447
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:42,720
World of Warcraft which is really nerdy but I haven't done a whole lot for

448
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:48,220
Halloween which is sad because I remember when Halloween was cool otherwise

449
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:51,320
I hung out with some friends I went up to Chico Friday night Chico's a small

450
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:56,300
little town. You know, our show's based in Sacramento, California. Chico's a town about

451
00:34:56,300 --> 00:35:00,640
90 minutes north of here, and it's one of those towns where the college pretty much

452
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:05,880
runs the town, so, you know, like the keg is the national flower and stuff in Chico.

453
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:11,880
So it was good times, though. Good times. You know, just did a little bit of drinking.

454
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:15,600
We drank butter beer, like Harry Potter. You know how they had the butter beer? We drank

455
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:18,000
butter beer. You know what they put in butter beer?

456
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
What is that?

457
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,400
Shnops, root beer, and vodka.

458
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:26,280
You know, when we went to the party last year, the one

459
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:30,640
that Rice Princess threw, we had the butter beer there,

460
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,840
and it was actually really good.

461
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,200
Everything there was really good,

462
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:38,440
and then I got sick and put in the hospital the next day.

463
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,320
But I mean, the food was great.

464
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,200
That's not funny.

465
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,160
No, no, the food didn't make me sick, though.

466
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:43,960
Oh, that's right.

467
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:46,960
Didn't we all suspect at first that Irene had poisoned you

468
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:47,600
or something?

469
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:48,320
Oh, no.

470
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,720
Irene's food had killed you somehow?

471
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:51,720
She killed me?

472
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:56,480
No, I didn't die, so, you know, I'm a trooper.

473
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:01,160
Little known fact about Extrofer, he had two major surgeries last year.

474
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,880
I did have two major surgeries last year.

475
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,000
Maybe he didn't want me to say that on the show, but...

476
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:09,240
Well, no, it's okay, you know, to say that.

477
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,240
Fine with it.

478
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,280
I'm over it, you know.

479
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,280
Extrofer's been cut up.

480
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,800
I have been cut up.

481
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:18,000
You know, lost a gallbladder, lost an appendix.

482
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,640
I'm 10% less Christopher than you saw before that.

483
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,960
I have room in me to stuff things.

484
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,960
Good.

485
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:29,800
You'll need that, like cocaine and stuff.

486
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:30,800
So is it my turn?

487
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,800
Yeah.

488
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:32,800
How was your week?

489
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,800
How was your day?

490
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,800
Okay.

491
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:40,620
Well, while Loki was getting in touch with his feminine side, I was doing my show on

492
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:47,880
Monday and I had a really good turnout, lots of listeners, 14 listeners, which was really

493
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:55,920
good and I enjoyed it and I can't wait to do it again tomorrow and stuff.

494
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:03,800
And also I played an ass-load of World of Warcraft this week, also I know it's almost

495
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:07,640
too sad to really talk about.

496
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:14,680
Yesterday I went to a movie, which I guess I'll get to later on in the show.

497
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:18,720
Let's just say I saw a movie with my sister.

498
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:24,520
My sister saw it too, okay?

499
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:31,660
So, you may want to look forward to my movie review later on.

500
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:32,660
It'll be spectabulous.

501
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:37,180
All right.

502
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:38,900
Like it'll be tabulous.

503
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:39,900
Like tab.

504
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:40,900
Give the microphone to Angel.

505
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:41,900
Okay.

506
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:42,900
There you go.

507
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:43,900
Angel, how was your week?

508
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:53,900
Oh, um, well, pretty good, um, had a lot of stuff to do at, uh, school and stuff like

509
00:37:53,900 --> 00:38:00,420
that, but then other than that, it was, oh dear, what's going on over there?

510
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:02,420
Come on, spill it!

511
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:10,620
Jamie, Jamie allows herself to get tied up with chatting with our chatters at orange.google.com,

512
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:16,120
I really don't want to know what that is.

513
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,120
Did you paste that in chat?

514
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,120
Yes I did.

515
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:21,120
It's a birthday cake with a giant cock on it, basically.

516
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:23,120
It has piercings with a cock right here.

517
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:27,120
I'm not talking about a chicken.

518
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:31,120
You know, nice that she did that right when I have them.

519
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,120
It's horrible.

520
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:34,120
That's not fair!

521
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:37,120
It's balls look diseased or something.

522
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:41,120
I mean, the balls look like couches. I mean, seriously.

523
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:43,120
Anyway, Angel, please continue.

524
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:45,120
I'm sorry, Angel.

525
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:49,120
Now I forgot what I was saying. Damn it. Damn it. Okay.

526
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:53,120
Well, yeah. I had a lot of school stuff to do, but then other than that, it was pretty much

527
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:56,120
gearing up for BlizzCon, even though I didn't really go.

528
00:38:56,120 --> 00:39:00,120
But I know a lot of stuff now, after the fact.

529
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:02,120
We can get to that later if you wish.

530
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,120
Sure.

531
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:10,120
a lot of stuff to talk about. I played a lot of World of Warcraft. I shouldn't have played

532
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:15,120
it and it was fun. All the cool kids play World of Warcraft now.

533
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:20,120
I'm going to pull an extrovert here. When we talk about World of Warcraft, you know,

534
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:26,120
the fact that we're going to be bringing it up, it might have your ears burning. And then

535
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:30,120
we'll be on a crusade later to tell you all the latest information.

536
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:40,360
I bet it was interesting to see oh wait I mean oh never mind shut up sorry I do

537
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:48,800
oh and um not that I ever talk about that other game called there but um I

538
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:54,880
kind of got nominated for like this big um council thing where like you work

539
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:59,440
with staff and there's you work with 15 other people and I get to find out

540
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:03,360

541
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:09,240

542
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,640

00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,240
yeah okay whatever

544
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:15,440
is it like the jedi council no think of like

545
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:20,560
we'll get a pointy hat and think of like student government where like you know

546
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:21,480
you

547
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:24,780
uh... after work with like the dean and

548
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:27,340
the waterworks

549
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:34,340
here it leads to there. Oh dear God. I mean the water sports camp. Okay, what can of worms did I open up?

550
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:38,700
Um, yeah, so it's just basically what, um,

551
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:44,580
you working with staff and fifteen of your other community members to

552
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:50,020
do like NDA stuff and, you know, for the game and develop things. NDA leads to

553
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:52,820
lawsuits. Oh dear God.

554
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:54,820

561
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:10,820

562
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:14,980

that's it

566
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:23,740
i guess

567
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:28,220
We should have had like a show or something where you know we just watch a movie and all

568
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:30,020
it is is just our reactions to it.

569
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:35,300
Like, oh my god, oh my, what'd she, what'd she do, oh my god, take that out, take that

570
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:36,300

Oh my god, not in the bat cave, oh no, no, and then make all my body to jump!

00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:51,920

uh... i think this shows in need of a break and when we come back from this break

576
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,760
we're gonna talk about some actual video game related things

577
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:09,360
uh... i want to talk about Ultra Mix 3 cause there's a whole shitload of news on Ultra Mix 3

578
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,860

You and I, together we can touch the sky

611
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:11,360
I was walking down the street

612
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:15,360
You came like the summer breeze

613
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:18,360
Sweeping my breath away

614
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:22,360
It doesn't happen every day

615
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:25,360
You and I together in the sky

This media sucks!

630
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:33,840
All over the world!

631
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:35,840
We want our servers!

632
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:37,840
That's right! P.S.!

DTPO

634
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:41,840
Hi welcome back kids

635
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:43,840
We're on Orange Lounge Radio

636
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:45,840
Here again, another week

637
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:47,840
Another Sunday, another show

638
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:49,840
Our 162nd show

639
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:51,840
If you can believe it

640
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:53,840
God I'm old!

641
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:55,840
No, just kidding. Not counting the half shows

642
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:57,840
Yes, very true

643
00:50:57,840 --> 00:50:59,840
That's true, that's true. We did have a couple half shows.

644
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:02,840
I'm old as far as shows. Yeah.

645
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:04,840
We've been here since, what, like show 27?

646
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:05,840
37.

647
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:06,840
37? I thought it was 27.

648
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:08,840
No. Oh, wait.

649
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:10,840
Oh well. Oh, a long time.

650
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:12,840
27. Sorry.

651
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:16,840
Um, again, ever since, you know, god, when did we start doing the podcast?

652
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:20,840
It was January this year, so it was like around 110 or so in show numbers.

653
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:24,840
No, I just, no, not that, I guess it would be sooner than that, about 120, 130.

654
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:27,440
It was when we really started getting a lot of new people.

655
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:28,440
Gee, I wonder why.

656
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:29,440
But that's cool.

657
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:33,560
No, we love the fact that people give a crap about us.

658
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:34,880
It's a very nice feeling.

659
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:39,240
Anyway, we give a crap about you, too, so we want you to have a chance to give back

660
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:40,640
to the show.

661
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:46,080
And you can do that by calling into our Skype line, which we're going to open up very soon

662
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:50,340
after we talk about the other couple topics here.

663
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:53,760
And also, we just announced this last week, so some of you guys might have missed this,

664
00:51:53,760 --> 00:52:00,340
now, not only can you call in over the Skype line by calling our username at OrangeLawnsRadio,

665
00:52:00,340 --> 00:52:05,940
but you can actually call us on the phone, 916-226-9067 is the OrangeLawnsRadio number,

666
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:11,020
so you'll be able to call into that very soon. So, very cool. You missed that, Jamie, that

667
00:52:11,020 --> 00:52:16,420
was last week. We have an actual number now. Wow! So we can get even more people calling

668
00:52:16,420 --> 00:52:25,460
in and telling us to go fuck ourselves, um, anyway, anyway, 916-226-9067, don't call yet,

669
00:52:25,460 --> 00:52:32,580
we're not answering, um, let's see, we also have our chat room going on, www.orangehonortrader.com,

670
00:52:32,580 --> 00:52:37,860
click on chat and you can see, um, all these folks chatting, including, um, Dirty Thief,

671
00:52:37,860 --> 00:52:43,460
who keeps wanting to get me to say his name, so there you have it, I said it. Now I'd have

672
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:48,580
Now I'm going to have to go through and say everybody's name, but maybe another time.

673
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:50,220
For now, I want to talk about Ultramix 3.

674
00:52:50,220 --> 00:52:54,220
Dance Dance Revolution Ultramix 3 is on its way out, and they've been taking it out on

675
00:52:54,220 --> 00:52:55,220
tour.

676
00:52:55,220 --> 00:52:58,860
I don't know if you guys heard about the Konami tour, but Konami's going around and touring

677
00:52:58,860 --> 00:53:04,420
the nation right now, and when I say nation, I mean a couple of select states.

678
00:53:04,420 --> 00:53:08,120
They already did the ones in California, but neglected to tell anybody that it was going

679
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:12,500
on in the DDR community, so none of us thought to go out, but it was in Southern California

680
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:17,660
So, we here at OLR wouldn't have been able to go, but right now, this past weekend, they

681
00:53:17,660 --> 00:53:21,900
have been in Texas, and they were in Texas today, and that's the last opportunity to

682
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:22,900
catch them in Texas.

683
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:29,020
However, they're going to go to Illinois over November 4th, 5th, and 6th, and then they'll

684
00:53:29,020 --> 00:53:34,760
be in Massachusetts, 11th, 12th, and 13th, and then the New York, New Jersey area, mostly

685
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:38,940
New Jersey, 18th, 19th, and 20th of November.

686
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:42,220
So if you want to check out the exact locations, we've got them posted on our site, orange

687
00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:45,940
orangeonsradio.com, just look for the little story about the Mall Tour and click Read More.

688
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:52,560
Now because of the Mall Tour, people have been getting to play final builds of the game

689
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:54,680
and came back to report a song list.

690
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:59,260
And so the song list is also posted on our website, www.orangeonsradio.com.

691
00:53:59,260 --> 00:54:03,440
I guess I'll go ahead and read through the song list here, where basically people have

692
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:09,660
put together, based on the song names, because what somebody did on DDR Freak is they went

693
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:13,580
to the tour and just wrote down all the names, but they neglected to write down all the artists,

694
00:54:13,580 --> 00:54:17,660
so they've kind of just been piecing it together which artists go with which songs.

695
00:54:17,660 --> 00:54:22,060
So we know about Akumaju Dracula Medli. This group, Blackalicious, has a song called

696
00:54:22,060 --> 00:54:27,620
Alphabet Aerobics, which should be very interesting. I think I actually might have a copy of it

697
00:54:27,620 --> 00:54:30,820
on my machine somewhere. I'm going to have to take a look.

698
00:54:30,820 --> 00:54:36,080
Bag by Revenge, of course, from DDRXtreme. By La Lacquia Carried with When, the Johnny

699
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:42,420
and S.P.E.S.H. mix, we already knew about that one, Orifiz with Basile, No FX with Bath

700
00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:44,180
of Least Resistance.

701
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:45,180
That's going to be interesting.

702
00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:46,180
No FX.

703
00:54:46,180 --> 00:54:47,180
That's going to be interesting.

704
00:54:47,180 --> 00:54:52,460
Moby with Body Rock, B4U with Breakdown, the new Naoki song Brilliant Red, Old School with

705
00:54:52,460 --> 00:54:57,660
Butterfly by Smile Decay, Candy Star by Love Unlimited, Carnival Day, which is a crossover

706
00:54:57,660 --> 00:55:03,580
from Guitar Freaks, Polteri and the Fufus, Colors, Midi Head Sapphire mix by DJ Pataka.

707
00:55:03,580 --> 00:55:06,020
There's two songs called Come With Me.

708
00:55:06,020 --> 00:55:09,120
One of them we know is the Rain Dancer version from the v-rare, we don't know what the other

709
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:10,120
one is.

710
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:14,940
Conflict, the Turmoil Mix by the Izoic, Crazy in Love, which is the Karaoke Revolution crossover

711
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:21,900
that was also in Extreme 2, Daikonkai, also in Extreme 2, Dansa Da Yuka by Big Idea,

712
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:23,660
which I believe is on the v-rare?

713
00:55:23,660 --> 00:55:24,660
I can't remember.

714
00:55:24,660 --> 00:55:32,220
Delta 32 is a song by We Don't Know Who, Destiny Lovers, a song from, I think, Extreme?

715
00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:33,220
I think?

716
00:55:33,220 --> 00:55:34,540
It's been all the time.

717
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:40,460
Drivin' by Naoki, which was in 2DX, Emotion, there's an old school song for you, Emotion

718
00:55:40,460 --> 00:55:48,260
from the club of pens, I believe, Eversnow from Max 2, Firefly by B4U, Frozen Ray, but

719
00:55:48,260 --> 00:55:53,180
it says Dirty Hurts, like it's a remix of Frozen Ray by DJ Taka.

720
00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:56,620
It was the one, it was the one that was on the V-Rare.

721
00:55:56,620 --> 00:55:58,500
Oh, okay.

722
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:03,420
Hash the Sun by Chetanix, which is also on the V-Rare, Hateful, we don't know who, here's

723
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:08,420
There's an A-list musical group, Hey Mama, by the Black Eyed Peas.

724
00:56:08,420 --> 00:56:09,420
Interesting.

725
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:10,420
I'm just glad it's not...

726
00:56:10,420 --> 00:56:11,420
My Humps?

727
00:56:11,420 --> 00:56:12,420
Thank God.

728
00:56:12,420 --> 00:56:18,580
I'm glad they didn't pick that song.

729
00:56:18,580 --> 00:56:22,860
You know, I was going to talk about my friend's funny dance to My Humps.

730
00:56:22,860 --> 00:56:24,660
You know my friend Billy, right?

731
00:56:24,660 --> 00:56:27,180
He got really drunk at the party and started dancing to My Humps.

732
00:56:27,180 --> 00:56:30,340
My Humps, My Humps.

733
00:56:30,340 --> 00:56:31,700
Maybe an Ultramix 4.

734
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:32,700
No.

735
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:37,340
on the phone, which we don't know who it's by. It sounds like Erotic, but it's not. That's

736
00:56:37,340 --> 00:56:41,500
not one of their songs. Sex on the Phone is a song by them, but it's not. I Am Gothic

737
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:46,700
by Spray. Hey, that's the one we announced on Orange on the Radio like weeks ago. Imperfection,

738
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:52,140
the Taiko Brahe remix by Real Life. Real Life did the song Send Me an Angel like years and

739
00:56:52,140 --> 00:56:55,320
years ago, and they still play it at like the golf clubs and stuff, so it should be

740
00:56:55,320 --> 00:57:02,320
interesting to there and there. A song called Insaner by Joni and Svesh. Interesting. They

741
00:57:02,660 --> 00:57:09,240
might be giants with Istanbul, not Constantinople. Cool! Which maybe we'll play, I'm going to

742
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:12,320
see which one of these songs. Maybe they just like it better that way. I have some of these

743
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:16,400
songs so we're going to try and dig them up. They might be giants. I will play Istanbul

744
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:20,760
if we can play it. What's also great about that too is one of the very first DWI sim

745
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:27,760
files that was ever out there was Istanbul NonConcept Noble, which is great.

746
00:57:50,760 --> 00:58:02,120
be like a Spanish song or Latino song, like something you would see on MTV Latin or something.

747
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:10,040
Midnight Frankenstein by Stay Gold Ponyboy. Miracle Moon LED Light Style Mix, Togo Project

748
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:15,600

749
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:19,640
funky music, which I believe was another crossover, wasn't it?

750
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:23,040
Play That Funky Music is... No, I'm thinking Pump of the Volley. I'm sorry.

751
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:26,520
No, that's from Karaoke Revolution. Ah, that's right.

752
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:31,660

00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:11,840
i don't want to hear the resolving of the one where they did it teamed up with

765

766
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:13,840

00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:20,760
Yep, it is.

769
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:22,840
It is Ray Charles.

770
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:26,160
Mitty had said that Ray Charles was going to be on.

771
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:32,160

I know I have Sold It For A Song by Zonk, so we're going to play a little clip of this.

780
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:22,920
This is something you're going to be hearing in DDR UltraMix 3.

781
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:23,920

There is nowhere to be found

785
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:07,920

Wow, I have to interrupt this.

794
01:02:01,020 --> 01:02:04,060
We're playing some clips from UltraMix 3.0, so I have to interrupt this to say that we

795
01:02:04,060 --> 01:02:05,500
We hit our cap tonight, you guys.

796
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:09,820
We have the maximum number of people on stream that we're supposed to be able to hold right

797
01:02:09,820 --> 01:02:11,760
now for what we're paying for at Live 365.

798
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:15,460
So we're going to have to pay more to fit 100 people on stuff now.

799
01:02:15,460 --> 01:02:18,460
So anyway, good job, you guys.

800
01:02:18,460 --> 01:02:19,820
That's where we put up the PayPal link.

801
01:02:19,820 --> 01:02:20,820
I know.

802
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:22,660
Yeah, we're going to have to put up the PayPal link now.

803
01:02:22,660 --> 01:02:25,080
Thank you guys for listening and making us successful.

804
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:28,220
If you are on the stream right now, don't disconnect because there are people in the

805
01:02:28,220 --> 01:02:30,340
chat room that are pissed that they can't get in.

806
01:02:30,340 --> 01:02:35,300
Anyway, let's go to another clip.

807
01:02:35,300 --> 01:02:36,300
This is a clip of...

808
01:02:36,300 --> 01:02:37,300
We've played this on the show before.

809
01:02:37,300 --> 01:02:38,460

01:03:38,460 --> 01:03:56,960
All right, let's do another clip.

812
01:03:56,960 --> 01:04:02,140
This is a song by Real Life called Imperfection, which is one that we named off as going to

813
01:04:02,140 --> 01:04:09,140
to be in DDR.

814
01:04:32,140 --> 01:04:34,140
She loves you so much

815
01:04:36,140 --> 01:04:38,140
I'm never coming down again

816
01:04:38,140 --> 01:04:43,140
I'm never coming down again

817
01:04:43,140 --> 01:04:47,140
I'm never coming down again

818
01:04:47,140 --> 01:04:50,140
I'm never coming down

819
01:04:51,140 --> 01:04:56,140
I'm your lover, love is what I like

820
01:04:56,140 --> 01:05:15,140
This is my imperfection, waiting for your direction

821
01:05:15,140 --> 01:05:22,140
This is my imperfection, waiting for resurrection

822
01:05:45,140 --> 01:06:01,060
Alright, that was another clip of a song that's going to be UltraMix 3, Real Life with Imperfection.

823
01:06:01,060 --> 01:06:03,860
I can't find Istanbul.

824
01:06:03,860 --> 01:06:06,140
I know I had that song years ago, so I'm going to have to get that.

825
01:06:06,140 --> 01:06:09,940
We'll play some more clips on some later shows before the game gets out.

826
01:06:09,940 --> 01:06:10,940
So check it out.

827
01:06:10,940 --> 01:06:12,940
What do you guys think of this UltraMix 3 song list?

828
01:06:12,940 --> 01:06:14,820
I'm curious to hear your feedback.

829
01:06:14,820 --> 01:06:15,620
Dark Sakura.

830
01:06:15,620 --> 01:06:17,460
Not quite so generic.

831
01:06:17,460 --> 01:06:19,380
It's very diverse, isn't it?

832
01:06:19,380 --> 01:06:22,100
They're definitely going for a very diverse,

833
01:06:22,100 --> 01:06:23,700
diverse listing, aren't they?

834
01:06:23,700 --> 01:06:29,600
It is very diverse. I like the system that they're so diverse.

835
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:33,020
Freaking Ray Charles and no FX

836
01:06:33,020 --> 01:06:34,660
in the same mix. That's crazy.

837
01:06:34,660 --> 01:06:36,380
That's pretty cute.

838
01:06:36,380 --> 01:06:38,340
What do you think, Loki?

839
01:06:38,340 --> 01:06:42,500
Um, it's pretty cool. I just don't have an Xbox, so...

840
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:44,500
We don't have the 360 though, right?

841
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:46,500
Yeah, it doesn't mean it's going to work on it.

842
01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:51,500
Because remember, it's only supporting about 20 games from the launch.

843
01:06:51,500 --> 01:06:53,500
That might not be one of the 20.

844
01:06:53,500 --> 01:06:59,500
I would figure it'd be the games that are closest to the launch, but who knows.

845
01:06:59,500 --> 01:07:04,500
So I'll just have to get it and wait for it to work.

846
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:06,500
Okay.

847
01:07:06,500 --> 01:07:08,500
I'm sure I'll get a copy for free.

848
01:07:08,500 --> 01:07:15,500
Angel, what do you think of the Ultramix 3 songs there?

849
01:07:15,500 --> 01:07:20,500
Like you said, pretty diverse. Yeah, I'm looking forward to it. We'll see what happens.

850
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:27,500
All right. I like it. I think it's just very diverse. It's going to be a great, great song list.

851
01:07:27,500 --> 01:07:30,500
Very solid. Looking forward to it. Be good.

852
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:37,500
Also, one other thing I want to point out about Ultramix 3 is that also what's been revealed in the demo

853
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:41,180
demo is that they're going to have a 0.5 speed.

854
01:07:41,180 --> 01:07:43,620
So it's like it's going to be able to slow down the arrows.

855
01:07:43,620 --> 01:07:46,460
So those of you guys that say, max 300 is too fast.

856
01:07:46,460 --> 01:07:48,700
Well, now you'll have a 0.5 modifier.

857
01:07:48,700 --> 01:07:51,500
So that's going to be very interesting.

858
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:54,060
And also, if you can play bag on 0.5,

859
01:07:54,060 --> 01:07:57,340
that would be very impressive.

860
01:07:57,340 --> 01:08:02,260
I know it's been done like on, excuse me,

861
01:08:02,260 --> 01:08:04,980
I know that that stuff's been done on like step mania

862
01:08:04,980 --> 01:08:06,900
and stuff, but it's nice to see it acknowledged

863
01:08:06,900 --> 01:08:16,160
like real BDR so oh yeah what arcade mix had the point five on it wasn't there

864
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:20,340
one of the boots or bootlegs or something someone the hacked extreme with

865
01:08:20,340 --> 01:08:29,200
the point five speed and the wave and break that were in there hmm so you

866
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:35,480
could in a sense try doing bag on point five speed break down to the point the

867
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:36,480
the end where it's just...

868
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:38,120
You just have to memorize the arrows, basically.

869
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:39,120
Pretty much, yeah.

870
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:41,680
Looks like a big clusterfuck of arrows would be no fun.

871
01:08:41,680 --> 01:08:42,680
Exactly.

872
01:08:42,680 --> 01:08:43,680
Alright.

873
01:08:43,680 --> 01:08:46,840
Alright, well, I think what we'll do now is we'll go ahead and open up the Skype line

874
01:08:46,840 --> 01:08:51,760
and take your calls, because we want to know what you guys have to say, and your thoughts

875
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:52,760
on what's going on.

876
01:08:52,760 --> 01:08:54,320
And we're already getting a call, so why not?

877
01:08:54,320 --> 01:08:55,320
Let's go for it.

878
01:08:55,320 --> 01:08:56,320
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

879
01:08:56,320 --> 01:08:57,320
Hey, what's up?

880
01:08:57,320 --> 01:08:58,320
It's Ronma.

881
01:08:58,320 --> 01:08:59,320
Hey, Ronma, how are you?

882
01:08:59,320 --> 01:09:00,320
Ronma!

883
01:09:00,320 --> 01:09:01,320
What?

884
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:02,320
What?

885
01:09:02,320 --> 01:09:03,320
What?

886
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:10,680
Yeah, this is the ultimate test of the message line, so I'm currently on the road as we speak.

887
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:12,240
You're currently on the road?

888
01:09:12,240 --> 01:09:14,880
Yeah, I'm coming back to my niece's house.

889
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:16,440
I'm on the bus heading back home.

890
01:09:16,440 --> 01:09:17,440
Oh, right on.

891
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:18,440
You know what?

892
01:09:18,440 --> 01:09:21,480
You might have trouble getting in when you get home because we hit our cap tonight.

893
01:09:21,480 --> 01:09:22,480
It's crazy.

894
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:28,800
We've got all these new listeners tonight, so we're happy, but very too bad that you

895
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:34,760
might not be able to get in when you get home when I get home somebody in the

896
01:09:34,760 --> 01:09:38,240
chat room is actually taping the show so I definitely get a copy yeah I heard

897
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:42,960
about our bootleggers we got going on so that's cool we we do it it's flattering

898
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:49,080
who said hey I call it syndication underground okay it's all good it's all

899
01:09:49,080 --> 01:09:52,840
good just we can't we're officially support it because of the license music

900
01:09:52,840 --> 01:09:53,940
issue but yeah

901
01:09:53,940 --> 01:09:56,180
underground cool

902
01:09:56,180 --> 01:09:57,740
uh...

903
01:09:57,740 --> 01:09:59,160
anyway all

904
01:09:59,160 --> 01:10:01,260
i think part of that i want to know

905
01:10:01,260 --> 01:10:04,220
happy halloween what are you doing really

906
01:10:04,220 --> 01:10:05,980
i will go to hang out

907
01:10:05,980 --> 01:10:09,700
tomorrow just in our total character that's going to enter not parading

908
01:10:09,700 --> 01:10:12,300
downtown manhattan

909
01:10:12,300 --> 01:10:17,040
no it's cool it might be our i'm going to act like tomorrow

910
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:18,880
their feathery

911
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:21,440
I'm gonna go around reaping my fellow co-workers

912
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:31,560
And last night we had a Halloween party out in Queens and let's just say everybody got trashed and

913
01:10:32,360 --> 01:10:37,800
Let's just say it blows down to this. Whatever happens on Halloween parties stays at a Halloween party

914
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:41,960
You have to beat it to understand

915
01:10:44,680 --> 01:10:46,680
One of those things well

916
01:10:46,680 --> 01:10:51,680
Um, we gotta kinda keep it short tonight, because we've got a ton of people trying to get in, but, uh, anything else you want to say?

917
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:52,680
You got it.

918
01:10:52,680 --> 01:10:55,680
That's it, and the message line works great, especially when you're out on the road.

919
01:10:55,680 --> 01:10:57,680
All right, sounds good.

920
01:10:57,680 --> 01:10:58,680
All right, you guys take care.

921
01:10:58,680 --> 01:11:00,680
All right, take care, bud. Later.

922
01:11:00,680 --> 01:11:01,680
You got it. Bye.

923
01:11:01,680 --> 01:11:05,680
And when he talks about our new message line, of course he's talking about the phone number that you can call in as well.

924
01:11:05,680 --> 01:11:11,680
916-226-9067 if you want to get through, or you can also give us a call on the old Skype line.

925
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:13,680
Let's go to another call.

926
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:14,680
I'm gonna pick up this one.

927
01:11:14,680 --> 01:11:29,300
Hi, you're on Orange

928
01:11:29,300 --> 01:11:31,300
It's Nintendo Maniac 64.

929
01:11:31,300 --> 01:11:33,300
Hi Nintendo Maniac 64, why are you pissed?

930
01:11:33,300 --> 01:11:37,300
Because I can't get into the radio station.

931
01:11:37,300 --> 01:11:38,300
You know, you're in the...

932
01:11:38,300 --> 01:11:39,300
The stupid...

933
01:11:39,300 --> 01:11:42,300
I don't know what to say, we've never been in this situation before.

934
01:11:42,300 --> 01:11:44,300
We've been on the air... No, one other time we were in this situation.

935
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:47,300
We've been on the air for three and a half years now.

936
01:11:47,300 --> 01:11:49,300
Literally, three and a half years.

937
01:11:49,300 --> 01:11:52,300
And we've only one other time been this popular.

938
01:11:52,300 --> 01:11:56,300
And the only reason we had so many people trying to get in that episode

939
01:11:56,300 --> 01:12:00,300
was because we were playing a brand new Akira Yamaoka song before anybody.

940
01:12:00,300 --> 01:12:02,300
It was a brand new DDR Akira Yamaoka song.

941
01:12:02,300 --> 01:12:04,300
It was the URAIN mix in DDR Extreme.

942
01:12:04,300 --> 01:12:06,800
We played it first, like months before the game came out,

943
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:08,800
and that's the only other time we ever hit our cap.

944
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:10,300
So this is very odd for us,

945
01:12:10,300 --> 01:12:12,300
that we're just here doing our normal thing,

946
01:12:12,300 --> 01:12:14,300
and we're so popular.

947
01:12:14,300 --> 01:12:18,300
So we really appreciate the support, of course, but it's kind of crazy, so.

948
01:12:19,300 --> 01:12:22,300
People get pissed.

949
01:12:22,300 --> 01:12:24,300
What, buddy? You're breaking up a little bit.

950
01:12:24,300 --> 01:12:25,800
People get pissed.

951
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:30,040
Yeah, I'm sorry, we're going to look at what we can do about increasing the cap so we can

952
01:12:30,040 --> 01:12:35,960
get more listeners in during the show, but for tonight, you guys are a little bit screwed,

953
01:12:35,960 --> 01:12:39,960
but you know what, go into our chat room at orangelunch.com and click on chat, and there's

954
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:46,400
people that can help you catch up on what you missed, so to speak, if you know what

955
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:47,400
I mean.

956
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:48,400
Yeah.

957
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:49,400
Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.

958
01:12:49,400 --> 01:12:50,400
Yeah.

959
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:51,400
All right.

960
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:55,040
Anything you want to say, gaming related or related to the show?

961
01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:58,040
Yeah, uh, you said you got Midway Arcade Treasures 3?

962
01:12:58,040 --> 01:13:01,040
Uh, run that by me one more time? You broke up a little bit there?

963
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:05,040
You said you got Midway Arcade Treasures 3?

964
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:07,040
Yes, I got Midway Arcade Treasures 3.

965
01:13:08,040 --> 01:13:12,040
Cool, I've been trying, like, forever to get that game.

966
01:13:12,040 --> 01:13:18,040
Really? It's not- I- I got it thanks to Loki, so I didn't try to go out and buy it in the store or anything, so...

967
01:13:18,040 --> 01:13:20,040
I guess I got kinda lucky.

968
01:13:20,040 --> 01:13:26,040
Well, not like... I'm not trying to drive, but I mean, like, as soon as I can't drive, yeah, it's so, like...

969
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:30,040
Ah, so you can take out your aggressions on Arcade Treasures 3, then, since you can't drive.

970
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:35,040
Hello?

971
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:40,040
I think we're breaking up, buddy. I think we're breaking up, buddy, so I'm gonna go ahead and let you go for now.

972
01:13:40,040 --> 01:13:42,040
But thanks for listening, and keep trying to get back in, all right?

973
01:13:42,040 --> 01:13:43,040
Okay.

974
01:13:43,940 --> 01:13:46,880
He's a Midway arcade treasures 3 of course is the eight

975
01:13:48,040 --> 01:13:50,960
Driving games kind of all put in one game

976
01:13:52,620 --> 01:13:59,520
Classics like hydro thunder and stun runner and my favorite iron man off-road with the track pack as well

977
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:02,800
Which I think is awesome, so anyway let's go to another call. Let's go to

978
01:14:03,740 --> 01:14:05,740
This one hi you're on orange on radio

979
01:14:08,540 --> 01:14:10,540
Hello you're on orange on radio

980
01:14:10,540 --> 01:14:14,540
Hello. Hello. Hi.

981
01:14:14,540 --> 01:14:18,540
Hi, who's this? This is Roz again. Hi Roz, how are you?

982
01:14:18,540 --> 01:14:22,540
Hi Roz! Hi. What's up?

983
01:14:22,540 --> 01:14:26,540
Actually I feel really damn great because I had my

984
01:14:26,540 --> 01:14:30,540
first ever Red Bull today.

985
01:14:30,540 --> 01:14:34,540
She had her first Red Bull today. Oh shit.

986
01:14:34,540 --> 01:14:38,540
I remember the first time I drank a Red Bull. It was because I

987
01:14:38,540 --> 01:14:41,540
staying up really late and I'd been up since like six in the morning and I was

988
01:14:41,540 --> 01:14:45,920
trying to stay out to go clubbing and I just it was like I was drunk but not

989
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:50,120
not really it's a different sensation than being drunk but but Red Bull is the

990
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:59,360
color of pee it is it really it looks a lot like it it's why it's in a can not a

991
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:03,080
clear bottle so why are you drinking Red Bull tonight are you just drinking it

992
01:15:03,080 --> 01:15:06,380
for recreational purposes, or?

993
01:15:06,380 --> 01:15:08,380
Well, I had never had one before.

994
01:15:08,380 --> 01:15:09,960
And I was going to get bottled water,

995
01:15:09,960 --> 01:15:12,080
but they were out of it for some reason,

996
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:14,600
at the little store place I was at.

997
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:18,840
So the other thing that they had that was cold was Red Bull.

998
01:15:18,840 --> 01:15:23,240
So I just picked one out and decided to drink it today.

999
01:15:23,240 --> 01:15:26,000
I feel great.

1000
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:27,720
You kind of sound like you're really happy.

1001
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,120
I'm just messing with you.

1002
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:31,700
That's great.

1003
01:15:31,700 --> 01:15:32,880
Damn it.

1004
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:38,320
The red bill gives you wings because it makes you freaking high.

1005
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:41,280
Yeah, exactly.

1006
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:44,000
So anything you want to share about what you've been hearing on the show so far?

1007
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:47,760
Anything going on in your video game world?

1008
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:49,560
Um...

1009
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:52,700
Rosling to be the Katamari cake.

1010
01:15:52,700 --> 01:15:57,520
Oh yeah, the Katamari cake. Dude, what is up with all these cakes you guys are

1011
01:15:57,520 --> 01:16:01,640
looking at tonight in chat? So there was the cake with the giant penis on it,

1012
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:06,000
And now there's the cake that's a katamari, the little prince of the cosmos pushing around

1013
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,000
the katamari.

1014
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:08,000
That's awesome.

1015
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:09,000
I want a cake like that for my birthday.

1016
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,960
Yeah, like two years ago I had a kirby cake.

1017
01:16:11,960 --> 01:16:14,920
Oh, that's so cute.

1018
01:16:14,920 --> 01:16:16,680
What was kirby doing on the kirby cake?

1019
01:16:16,680 --> 01:16:19,600
He was just kind of being there.

1020
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:21,760
Just chilling out saying, hey, I'm a cake.

1021
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:22,760
In the fridge.

1022
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:27,840
And I couldn't look in the fridge for like two days because it was supposed to be a surprise.

1023
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:28,840
Okay.

1024
01:16:28,840 --> 01:16:35,840
Yeah, so I would be like making eggs and I'd have to shut my eyes and I'd end up like sticking my hand in mashed potatoes or something.

1025
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:38,840
What flavor was Kirby when you ate him?

1026
01:16:38,840 --> 01:16:40,840
Strawberry.

1027
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:42,840
Awesome. That's a very Kirby flavor.

1028
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:44,840
Kirby is strawberry.

1029
01:16:44,840 --> 01:16:45,840
Delicious.

1030
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:51,840
Well, Roz, we're going to go ahead and let you go so we can get to another caller, but thanks so much for calling in and sharing the Kirby cake love with us.

1031
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:55,840
And enjoy that Red Bull, but please, don't drink and drive.

1032
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:56,840
Alright?

1033
01:16:56,840 --> 01:16:57,840
Okay.

1034
01:16:57,840 --> 01:16:59,360
Have a good one.

1035
01:16:59,360 --> 01:16:59,860
Bye.

1036
01:16:59,860 --> 01:17:01,440
Oh, I also want to say, Roz, Roz, wait.

1037
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:02,440
Actually, it's Hockwell.

1038
01:17:02,440 --> 01:17:02,940
Wait.

1039
01:17:02,940 --> 01:17:03,800
Liquor was here.

1040
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:07,080
Roz, I just want to say real quick, one more thing.

1041
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:11,480
Do you drink liquor at all, ever?

1042
01:17:11,480 --> 01:17:12,200
No.

1043
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:12,700
OK.

1044
01:17:12,700 --> 01:17:14,320
Because I was going to say, if you ever

1045
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:17,880
want to try something really crazy, mix your Red Bull

1046
01:17:17,880 --> 01:17:19,040
with vodka.

1047
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:19,840
Good stuff.

1048
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:21,240
Good stuff.

1049
01:17:21,240 --> 01:17:21,760
All right.

1050
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:23,760
Oh, I've got a bottle of absolute downstairs.

1051
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:25,400
Because vodka numbs the taste buds

1052
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:28,780
make you not taste the pea flavor of Red Bull I don't I don't want to be

1053
01:17:28,780 --> 01:17:32,120
responsible for starting someone's drinking career so you stay away from

1054
01:17:32,120 --> 01:17:42,000
the absolute for tonight all right take care bye bye let's go to another call

1055
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:48,600
hi you're on Orange Lounge radio hey hey who's this this is a Xander from Florida

1056
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:51,560
again hi Xander from Florida aren't you one of our listeners who shut out right

1057
01:17:51,560 --> 01:17:52,560
now?

1058
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:53,560
Yes.

1059
01:17:53,560 --> 01:17:56,460
Oh, I'm so sorry to hear it, but I don't know what to tell you.

1060
01:17:56,460 --> 01:17:57,460
This is crazy.

1061
01:17:57,460 --> 01:18:00,520
I've never seen this happen on Orange Lounge.

1062
01:18:00,520 --> 01:18:04,200
Did somebody hear that we were giving away a million dollars or something?

1063
01:18:04,200 --> 01:18:05,200
I don't know why.

1064
01:18:05,200 --> 01:18:06,200
They knew that I was back.

1065
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:10,240
That's what I've been telling people to get them to listen.

1066
01:18:10,240 --> 01:18:11,240
So I don't know.

1067
01:18:11,240 --> 01:18:12,240
Maybe that's the problem.

1068
01:18:12,240 --> 01:18:13,240
No.

1069
01:18:13,240 --> 01:18:14,240
We're going to do something about it.

1070
01:18:14,240 --> 01:18:16,540
We're just going to have to pony up the extra money to double our cap.

1071
01:18:16,540 --> 01:18:22,840
But that will involve probably all of us having to get a second job, so no, I'm kidding.

1072
01:18:22,840 --> 01:18:23,840
We're going to do something about it.

1073
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:27,320
We just can't do it tonight, so to speak, so you guys are kind of locked out tonight.

1074
01:18:27,320 --> 01:18:31,160
So we're just surprised, because we have not been in danger of hitting our cap.

1075
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:35,560
But little known fact, or well, maybe not so little, but our podcast was actually featured

1076
01:18:35,560 --> 01:18:37,160
on Yahoo this week.

1077
01:18:37,160 --> 01:18:43,960
So I think because of that, if you go to podcast.yahoo.com, you see a little picture of our podcast.

1078
01:18:43,960 --> 01:18:49,400
So I think that, in turn, created more podcast downloads, which, in turn, have created more

1079
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:51,720
show listeners.

1080
01:18:51,720 --> 01:18:56,200
We're very happy that folks are tuning in to listen to the madness, but it's kind of

1081
01:18:56,200 --> 01:18:57,680
crazy at the same time.

1082
01:18:57,680 --> 01:19:01,400
Well, Xander, since you're not able to listen to the show, is there anything you want to

1083
01:19:01,400 --> 01:19:03,400
tell our listeners?

1084
01:19:03,400 --> 01:19:08,400
No, I can't think of anything right now.

1085
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:10,560
I know I had something before.

1086
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:12,640
I always lose it whenever I call you guys.

1087
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:16,360
It's the pressures of being on air that make you forget things, huh?

1088
01:19:16,360 --> 01:19:20,440
So if you ever wonder why we don't ever talk about video games on the live show, it's the

1089
01:19:20,440 --> 01:19:21,880
pressures of being on air.

1090
01:19:21,880 --> 01:19:23,680
We completely forget about games.

1091
01:19:23,680 --> 01:19:24,680
We do.

1092
01:19:24,680 --> 01:19:26,720
All right, Xander, well, thanks for the call.

1093
01:19:26,720 --> 01:19:27,720
Have a good one, okay?

1094
01:19:27,720 --> 01:19:28,720
And I hope you get in.

1095
01:19:28,720 --> 01:19:29,720
Okay.

1096
01:19:29,720 --> 01:19:30,720
All right.

1097
01:19:30,720 --> 01:19:31,720
Keep trying.

1098
01:19:31,720 --> 01:19:32,720
Later.

1099
01:19:32,720 --> 01:19:33,720
All right.

1100
01:19:33,720 --> 01:19:34,720
Thank you, Xander, for calling.

1101
01:19:34,720 --> 01:19:37,120
Okay, we're actually going to shut off the Skyplane just for a little bit and go to an

1102
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:38,120
actual break.

1103
01:19:38,120 --> 01:19:42,600
We are going to come back, so if you haven't gotten through just yet, don't cry and scream

1104
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:20,600
Alright, we're going to do some DDR music in this break, and, um, oh yes, uh, Dark Soccer wanted to hear some You're Not Here, which was a song in DDR.

1105
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:24,600
Yeah, that's one of those songs with that belt-out outfit in my car when no one's in there with me.

1106
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:26,600
Oh, I want to hear your lovely singing voice sometime.

1107
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:31,600
Um, you won't because I don't have one.

1108
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:40,600
Fine. We'll be back after this, uh, with more Orange Lounge Radio, and your calls, and, oh, we'll, okay, we'll get the employer request soon.

1109
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:56,080
for watching, and I'll see you in the next video.

1110
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:42,600
You hadn't let me

1111
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:46,600
I'd be fine on my own, baby

1112
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:50,600
Never felt so lonely then you

1113
01:21:50,600 --> 01:21:52,600
Came along

1114
01:21:52,600 --> 01:21:55,600
So now what should I do?

1115
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:58,600
I'm strong out, I did it to you

1116
01:21:58,600 --> 01:22:02,600
My body aches, now that you're gone

1117
01:22:02,600 --> 01:22:07,600
My supply fell through

1118
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:12,000
And they gave me everything you had and more

1119
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,500
He craves my happiness

1120
01:22:14,500 --> 01:22:17,100
When you make me feel joy in me

1121
01:22:17,100 --> 01:22:21,400
Just smile, but now I feel your stress

1122
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:26,000
Love was never meant to be such a crazy affair, no

1123
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,400
And who has time but you?

1124
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:33,500
Never fall, I sit around and forever you love

1125
01:22:33,500 --> 01:22:40,220
talking to you now

1126
01:23:03,500 --> 01:23:24,380
Can you be your fantasy?

1127
01:23:24,380 --> 01:23:27,380
Audit let's XC

1128
01:24:24,380 --> 01:24:38,380
Look at what you see in your face The mirror of a dream

1129
01:24:38,380 --> 01:24:48,380
Make believe I'm everywhere Living in your eyes

1130
01:24:48,380 --> 01:24:50,380
Living in your eyes

1131
01:24:51,380 --> 01:24:53,380
Return on the page

1132
01:24:54,380 --> 01:24:56,380
It's the end of the world

1133
01:24:56,380 --> 01:24:58,380
Never ending

1134
01:24:58,380 --> 01:25:00,380
Slowly

1135
01:25:04,380 --> 01:25:05,380
Never ending

1136
01:25:05,380 --> 01:25:11,380
Glory, ah

1137
01:25:19,380 --> 01:25:25,380
Life is a secret when I fall behind the clouds

1138
01:25:25,380 --> 01:25:28,380
There is once a rainbow

1139
01:25:28,380 --> 01:25:33,380
The answer to my never-ending song

1140
01:25:33,380 --> 01:25:38,380
And I'll never be lost

1141
01:25:38,380 --> 01:25:45,380
Never in my life

1142
01:25:51,380 --> 01:25:53,380
Love, our truth

1143
01:25:53,380 --> 01:25:56,380
This is what I prove

1144
01:25:56,380 --> 01:25:59,380
Between me and you

1145
01:25:59,380 --> 01:26:02,380
Oh, oh

1146
01:26:02,380 --> 01:26:06,880
Love or truth, which I want you to choose

1147
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:09,380
Is for me and you

1148
01:26:09,380 --> 01:26:11,380
Oh, oh, oh

1149
01:26:12,380 --> 01:26:15,380
Baby, don't you think we're the kind of love

1150
01:26:15,380 --> 01:26:16,380
I wanna get

1151
01:26:16,380 --> 01:26:19,380
We wanna, wanna be, wanna be

1152
01:26:19,380 --> 01:26:22,380
But I'm gonna die, you're my body

1153
01:26:22,380 --> 01:26:24,880
Don't get me in your way

1154
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:27,380
Baby, don't you wish to be

1155
01:26:27,380 --> 01:26:29,880
Gonna die the other day

1156
01:26:59,880 --> 01:27:10,880
You know the way you and I gotta be

1157
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:23,880
You know the way you and I gotta be

1158
01:27:23,880 --> 01:27:51,640
Alright, so typically this is the part of the show where we come back on air, however,

1159
01:27:51,640 --> 01:27:55,760
Due to popular demand from our chat room, we are going to do one more song, and it's

1160
01:27:55,760 --> 01:27:58,720
a brand new song from DER Ultramix 3.

1161
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:02,600
We're going to play this full song because it just rocks that much.

1162
01:28:02,600 --> 01:28:03,600
Enjoy.

1163
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:10,600
It has a quiet opening, but trust me, this song is playing.

1164
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:39,720
It's Istanbul, it's Constantinople Now it's Istanbul, not Constantinople

1165
01:28:39,720 --> 01:28:44,200
Been a long time gone, it's Constantinople Now it's Thursday night, on a moonlit night

1166
01:28:44,200 --> 01:28:49,200
Every gal in Constantinople lives in Istanbul Now it's Constantinople, so do you that they

1167
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:52,200
live in Constantinople Shall we wait again in Istanbul?

1168
01:28:52,200 --> 01:28:58,900
Even old New York was once New Amsterdam Why they changed it, I can't say

1169
01:28:58,900 --> 01:29:02,900
People just liked it better that way So take me back to Constantinople

1170
01:29:02,900 --> 01:29:06,140
No, you can't go back to Constantinople, been a long time gone

1171
01:29:06,140 --> 01:29:09,140
Constantinople, why did Constantinople get the works?

1172
01:29:09,140 --> 01:29:12,140
That's cool, but it's just about the terse

1173
01:29:19,140 --> 01:29:20,140
Istanbul

1174
01:29:20,140 --> 01:29:33,660
Istanbul, even old New York Was once New Amsterdam

1175
01:29:33,660 --> 01:29:37,380
Why they changed it, I can't say You just liked it better that way

1176
01:29:37,380 --> 01:29:41,780
It's Istanbul with Constantinople Now it's Istanbul with Constantinople

1177
01:29:41,780 --> 01:29:45,780
They're a long time gone in Constantinople Why did Constantinople get the works?

1178
01:29:45,780 --> 01:29:48,780
That's so much as it's by the Turks

1179
01:29:48,780 --> 01:30:18,660
So take me back to Constantinople No you can't go back to Constantinople

1180
01:30:18,660 --> 01:30:22,660
It's been a long time gone, Constantinople, why did Constantinople get the works?

1181
01:30:22,660 --> 01:30:27,660
That's nobody's business but the Turks

1182
01:30:27,660 --> 01:30:32,660
Istanbul

1183
01:30:57,660 --> 01:30:58,660
to worry about.

1184
01:30:58,660 --> 01:30:59,660
Loki?

1185
01:30:59,660 --> 01:31:00,660
What's up?

1186
01:31:00,660 --> 01:31:01,660
What's on your mind?

1187
01:31:01,660 --> 01:31:02,660
Nothing.

1188
01:31:02,660 --> 01:31:04,220
I have a figure I'll save it for after the cage match in my normal segment, which I covered

1189
01:31:04,220 --> 01:31:05,940
the SimNews.

1190
01:31:05,940 --> 01:31:08,900
Is there actually going to be SimNews tonight, or are you just going to go in there and-

1191
01:31:08,900 --> 01:31:09,900
Of course!

1192
01:31:09,900 --> 01:31:12,620
Did you know that DDR Mania X actually came back?

1193
01:31:12,620 --> 01:31:13,620
Did they?

1194
01:31:13,620 --> 01:31:14,620
I didn't know that.

1195
01:31:14,620 --> 01:31:16,460
Apparently, they've been up for a while now, and-

1196
01:31:16,460 --> 01:31:18,620
Can I- I have a confession to make.

1197
01:31:18,620 --> 01:31:19,620
I don't- no, no, no.

1198
01:31:19,620 --> 01:31:22,140
I don't want to offend anybody when I say this.

1199
01:31:22,140 --> 01:31:25,660
I don't really visit any Bahmani sites besides DDR freakin' Orange Lounge.

1200
01:31:25,660 --> 01:31:26,660
I really don't.

1201
01:31:26,660 --> 01:31:31,660
Bemani style once in a great while, I kind of lurk just to kind of see what the goings ons are

1202
01:31:31,660 --> 01:31:36,660
and I think I've done the same on air in Japan, but on a regular basis, I only visit DDR Freakin' Orange Lounge.

1203
01:31:36,660 --> 01:31:38,660
I don't really surf the other sites.

1204
01:31:38,660 --> 01:31:42,660
And it's not that they're bad sites, it's just I don't have time.

1205
01:31:42,660 --> 01:31:43,660
Yes it is.

1206
01:31:43,660 --> 01:31:50,660
We will have, hopefully, if everything works out, and I will go into this later,

1207
01:31:50,660 --> 01:31:55,660
we will have more stuff in our download section for our PSP site.

1208
01:31:55,660 --> 01:32:18,660
I just want to interrupt with one thing. A haiku.

1209
01:32:18,660 --> 01:32:21,660
Go for it.

1210
01:32:21,660 --> 01:32:27,520
I'm going to, I figured that I would start, you know, giving our listeners a little bit

1211
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:28,520
of culture.

1212
01:32:28,520 --> 01:32:31,480
Since the Your Mama Joke of the Week kind of faded out, we're going to change that now

1213
01:32:31,480 --> 01:32:32,480
to the Haiku of the Week?

1214
01:32:32,480 --> 01:32:33,480
Yeah.

1215
01:32:33,480 --> 01:32:34,480
Okay, so we're going to have the Haiku of the Week.

1216
01:32:34,480 --> 01:32:36,480
Do you want some background music for your Haiku of the Week?

1217
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:37,480
No.

1218
01:32:37,480 --> 01:32:38,480
Okay.

1219
01:32:38,480 --> 01:32:39,480
After this one.

1220
01:32:39,480 --> 01:32:40,480
Okay.

1221
01:32:40,480 --> 01:32:44,520
Today's Haiku is a summarization of Gulliver's Towels by Jonathan Swift.

1222
01:32:44,520 --> 01:32:54,040
Thus I was first great, then small, and much vexed to learn that size does matter.

1223
01:32:54,040 --> 01:32:57,760
Interesting.

1224
01:32:57,760 --> 01:33:01,460
You know, if you ever run out of advice columns, you should just have the haiku of the week

1225
01:33:01,460 --> 01:33:02,800
on the podcast.

1226
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:03,800
Something.

1227
01:33:03,800 --> 01:33:05,620
The Kama Sutra.

1228
01:33:05,620 --> 01:33:07,960
Advice for those in a difficult position.

1229
01:33:07,960 --> 01:33:14,960
to be flexible.

1230
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:18,920
Speaking of the Kama Sutra, let's talk about the Burning Crusade. Things you don't want

1231
01:33:18,920 --> 01:33:24,040
after practicing the Kama Sutra. You don't want a Burning Crusade. Angel, you're one

1232
01:33:24,040 --> 01:33:28,200
of our resident World of Warcraft whores. Who's got the highest level? What's your highest

1233
01:33:28,200 --> 01:33:32,440
level? Me. DarkSakura? Seven. And Loki, you don't play that bullshit. My highest level

1234
01:34:02,440 --> 01:34:08,240
all know. And I never really got into Warcraft 3 or Warcraft 2. I played a lot of Warcraft

1235
01:34:08,240 --> 01:34:11,760
2, actually, but I was really fucking bad at it. Like, when I say really fucking bad,

1236
01:34:11,760 --> 01:34:15,800
I mean really fucking bad at Warcraft. I did not have the brain capacity to handle so many

1237
01:34:15,800 --> 01:34:19,280
things going on at once. Yeah, all of Warcraft is not a problem for me.

1238
01:34:19,280 --> 01:34:24,560
Oh, man. I can't even explain it. I mean, I know there's a lot out there, you know,

1239
01:34:24,560 --> 01:34:30,220
City of Heroes and now soon City of Villains and Final Fantasy XI and just, you know, there's

1240
01:34:30,220 --> 01:34:40,220
There's a lot out there, EQ2, yeah, but it was a workout for me, wow, it's just, no pun

1241
01:34:40,220 --> 01:34:41,220
intended.

1242
01:34:41,220 --> 01:34:42,220
Yeah, all right, that's cool.

1243
01:34:42,220 --> 01:34:43,220
So what's up?

1244
01:34:43,220 --> 01:34:44,220
What's going to happen with this new expansion?

1245
01:34:44,220 --> 01:34:46,900
Oh, so much.

1246
01:34:46,900 --> 01:34:52,980
We're going to have what's called rideable mounts, which currently they have mounts for

1247
01:34:52,980 --> 01:34:54,940
each race.

1248
01:34:54,940 --> 01:35:00,580
When you hit 40, you can, you know, save up all your money and go train on riding and

1249
01:35:00,580 --> 01:35:05,980
then go get your mount so that you can, like, be all cool and ride all fast around the lands

1250
01:35:05,980 --> 01:35:08,940
rather than walking, because, well, we all know walking sucks.

1251
01:35:08,940 --> 01:35:10,400
Yeah, walking sucks.

1252
01:35:10,400 --> 01:35:12,180
And flying those birds takes forever sometimes, too.

1253
01:35:12,180 --> 01:35:15,900
Yes, flying those birds can take forever and they can be expensive depending on where you

1254
01:35:15,900 --> 01:35:18,780
need to go, so that's cool.

1255
01:35:18,780 --> 01:35:23,140
They're going to have flyable mounts now in the new expansion.

1256
01:35:23,140 --> 01:35:29,580
There's also going to be a lot of areas you need to explore and stuff like that.

1257
01:35:29,580 --> 01:35:36,740
They're raising the level cap from 60 to 70, which will enable us to go beyond the dark

1258
01:35:36,740 --> 01:35:38,420
portal.

1259
01:35:38,420 --> 01:35:44,860
If you guys remember Warcraft 2 expansion, beyond the dark portal, quote unquote, and

1260
01:35:44,860 --> 01:35:50,460
then, you know, Warcraft 3 and then so we're going to be able to go through the portal

1261
01:35:50,460 --> 01:35:53,780
and i believe one of the um...

1262
01:35:53,780 --> 01:35:55,460
things that you can do

1263
01:35:55,460 --> 01:35:57,640
when you go beyond the dark portal

1264
01:35:57,640 --> 01:36:02,020
is um... if you're a hoard you get to fight the final battle with thrall and try

1265
01:36:02,020 --> 01:36:04,640
to save him and like all the stuff so

1266
01:36:04,640 --> 01:36:08,540
that's going to be neat um... socketable items if you guys have played

1267
01:36:08,540 --> 01:36:10,580
uh...

1268
01:36:10,580 --> 01:36:13,100
diablo 2

1269
01:36:13,100 --> 01:36:15,380
yeah that's going to be kind of neat

1270
01:36:15,380 --> 01:36:16,740
uh... there's just going to be

1271
01:36:16,740 --> 01:36:18,220
so much i

1272
01:36:18,220 --> 01:36:22,020
I mean that's just, you know, the tip of the iceberg.

1273
01:36:22,020 --> 01:36:23,660
Uh... new race

1274
01:36:23,660 --> 01:36:26,620
for the Horde is going to be Blood Elves.

1275
01:36:26,620 --> 01:36:30,400
Um... I do not know what the alliance is going to get, but...

1276
01:36:30,400 --> 01:36:34,500
Ah, well, it's rumored it's going to be Pandaren, so...

1277
01:36:34,500 --> 01:36:36,180
Pandaren.

1278
01:36:36,180 --> 01:36:38,260
Pandaren.

1279
01:36:38,260 --> 01:36:41,020
But, yeah, so...

1280
01:36:41,020 --> 01:36:43,920
Uh... yeah.

1281
01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:47,140
I don't know, am I forgetting something, Mr. Rob?

1282
01:36:47,140 --> 01:36:53,100
I think you hit on most of the big points about what's going on with the expansion.

1283
01:36:53,100 --> 01:36:57,300
The rumored Pandarian would be so cool if that really happens.

1284
01:36:57,300 --> 01:36:59,580
I think you hit on most of the other big stuff.

1285
01:36:59,580 --> 01:37:03,820
There's going to be a new profession like alchemy and stuff to go along with the socketed

1286
01:37:03,820 --> 01:37:04,820
items.

1287
01:37:04,820 --> 01:37:06,820
You could be a jewel master.

1288
01:37:06,820 --> 01:37:10,860
Yeah, I can't really think of anything else.

1289
01:37:10,860 --> 01:37:15,220
I probably did forget something or whatever along the way, but...

1290
01:37:15,220 --> 01:37:18,220
Now, there's more information all over the internet, obviously, so take a look.

1291
01:37:18,220 --> 01:37:24,220
Yeah, it's all over the internet now, but as it was coming out this weekend, I knew about a lot of it, so as it was coming out...

1292
01:37:24,220 --> 01:37:26,220
Were you on the cell phone with somebody at the car or something?

1293
01:37:26,220 --> 01:37:37,220
Actually, as you know, I'm kind of heavily watching another radio station that's heavily, heavily into World of Warcraft, and that's all they do on the station.

1294
01:37:37,220 --> 01:37:38,220
You can plug them, I don't care.

1295
01:37:38,220 --> 01:37:39,220
Oh, wcradio.com.

1296
01:37:39,220 --> 01:37:40,220
Okay.

1297
01:37:40,220 --> 01:37:41,220
Well, you know that.

1298
01:37:41,220 --> 01:37:44,340

01:38:40,180 --> 01:38:43,980
list so far sounds pretty interesting and it's it's not that they give

1321
01:38:43,980 --> 01:38:46,380
nami of hawaii a big budget now

1322
01:38:46,380 --> 01:38:51,940
it is kind of weird like i had this all these songs from so many random

1323
01:38:51,940 --> 01:38:53,640
different places but

1324
01:38:53,640 --> 01:38:57,020
i don't know i strangely dig it there's really is something for everyone i mean

1325
01:38:57,020 --> 01:38:59,900
i know they've said that about previous tdr mixes

1326
01:38:59,900 --> 01:39:03,580
that later something for everyone that no seriously guys this time something

1327
01:39:03,580 --> 01:39:07,000
for everyone like even like ray charles

1328
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:08,820
no affects come on that

1329
01:39:08,820 --> 01:39:13,660
That's tapping into audiences that never would have looked twice at DDR before, so that's

1330
01:39:13,660 --> 01:39:14,660
something else.

1331
01:39:14,660 --> 01:39:15,660
Yeah.

1332
01:39:15,660 --> 01:39:21,540
But otherwise, something you haven't really talked about is the recent release of DDR

1333
01:39:21,540 --> 01:39:23,980
Mario Mix here.

1334
01:39:23,980 --> 01:39:28,900
I kind of glossed over DDR Mario Mix because I haven't picked up my copy yet, because I

1335
01:39:28,900 --> 01:39:34,980
bought Soul Calibur 3 instead this week, which should show you where I'm at DDR-wise.

1336
01:39:34,980 --> 01:39:40,060
Plus, you know, I just... it doesn't seem like something that's that difficult, but

1337
01:39:40,060 --> 01:39:41,060
I don't know, what do you think?

1338
01:39:41,060 --> 01:39:43,060
Did you pick it up?

1339
01:39:43,060 --> 01:39:47,100
Uh, technically, I did, but I got it for free, so...

1340
01:39:47,100 --> 01:39:48,100
Okay, okay.

1341
01:39:48,100 --> 01:39:50,380
Oh, did you, like, win one of those tournaments or something?

1342
01:39:50,380 --> 01:39:54,660
Uh, yeah, only three people showed up, and two of which were my friends.

1343
01:39:54,660 --> 01:39:56,540
Good job, good job anyway.

1344
01:39:56,540 --> 01:40:02,420
Yeah, so I just got it for free, and I unlocked pretty much everything just last night, and

1345
01:40:02,420 --> 01:40:03,420
it was totally heavy.

1346
01:40:03,420 --> 01:40:10,260
cool or was it all Mario stuff and and classical tunes being redone? Yeah it's

1347
01:40:10,260 --> 01:40:15,760
it's okay the song is okay. What I think is interesting is the way they did it of

1348
01:40:15,760 --> 01:40:18,920
how it's just like a Mario game where you go through different worlds and go

1349
01:40:18,920 --> 01:40:27,960
through the levels in the worlds. Really? Yeah but otherwise it's I think

1350
01:40:27,960 --> 01:40:31,860
it's really good that I got it for free because I wouldn't really pay for it

1351
01:40:31,860 --> 01:40:34,740
unless it was maybe cheaper.

1352
01:40:34,740 --> 01:40:39,520
Yeah, it's a little too much money for me right now, too. Don't they want, like, 60 bucks for it with the pad and everything?

1353
01:40:39,520 --> 01:40:45,720
Yeah, but I actually think that soft pad is really nice. It has more padding in the middle.

1354
01:40:45,720 --> 01:40:53,440
The pads have been getting progressively nicer through various CDR mixes, because we had the one for, you know, the original one, which is okay.

1355
01:40:53,440 --> 01:41:00,040
And there was actually the old old Konami mat for the Dreamcast that had that funny layer of plastic over the mat.

1356
01:41:00,040 --> 01:41:03,040
That's right, you had these mats. They were like some of the first mats I ever played on.

1357
01:41:03,040 --> 01:41:08,400
I had the Dreamcast ones that were the triple thicky thing, and now they slide apart.

1358
01:41:08,400 --> 01:41:12,040
Yeah. But then... They're not as good as one thinks they are.

1359
01:41:12,040 --> 01:41:17,240
And then the Xbox ones were really good, and now the GameCube ones. So they've had a lot of time to get it right.

1360
01:41:17,240 --> 01:41:23,120
So. Yeah. So far, I think those are the best soft pads, but I have a metal pad anyway, so...

1361
01:41:23,120 --> 01:41:27,720
whatever. I don't care. Do you think there's enough here for DDR fans to be happy?

1362
01:41:27,720 --> 01:41:40,720
If you're a fan of Mario, yeah. But I mean, you can't even play the hardest level unless you beat the song on Very Hard, very much like Disney Mix.

1363
01:41:40,720 --> 01:41:41,720
Okay.

1364
01:41:41,720 --> 01:41:45,720
Which, all right, it's annoying, but Very Hard is just like an easy standard.

1365
01:41:45,720 --> 01:41:49,720
I was going to say, isn't Very Hard like Five and Sixes anyway?

1366
01:41:49,720 --> 01:41:50,720
Yeah.

1367
01:41:50,720 --> 01:41:51,720
Yeah.

1368
01:41:51,720 --> 01:41:52,720
So Mario...

1369
01:41:52,720 --> 01:41:53,720
randomized.

1370
01:41:53,720 --> 01:41:54,720
Go ahead.

1371
01:41:54,720 --> 01:41:55,720
It's all right, it's all right.

1372
01:41:55,720 --> 01:42:02,260
Mario Mix is kind of one of those games that's going to be more for kids, people that just

1373
01:42:02,260 --> 01:42:09,340
are obsessed with Nintendo, like ultimate Nintendo fanboys and stuff, or you know, people

1374
01:42:09,340 --> 01:42:12,500
that like the GameCube or only have a GameCube or like the GameCube things.

1375
01:42:12,500 --> 01:42:16,620
I think most of the hardcore DDR people are going to find their game somewhere else.

1376
01:42:16,620 --> 01:42:20,220
It's definitely a good mix to start out with for somebody who hasn't played yet though.

1377
01:42:20,220 --> 01:42:21,220
Oh, that's cool.

1378
01:42:21,220 --> 01:42:22,220
It's definitely good.

1379
01:42:22,220 --> 01:42:23,220
They need that too.

1380
01:42:23,220 --> 01:42:29,220
Alright, well Sephiroth1215, I'll let you have your final words, then we're going to let you go, try to get another call.

1381
01:42:29,220 --> 01:42:43,220
Alright, last thing I wanted to say, which I can't confirm or anything, I just heard around, is that the Xbox 360 is, you can't get the premiums in first come, first serve stores.

1382
01:42:43,220 --> 01:42:47,300
stores. I hope that's a lot of bullshit, because if it is not bullshit and that leads out to

1383
01:42:47,300 --> 01:42:50,980
be true, I'm going to be one pissed motherfucker. I'm going to be one pissed motherfucker. I

1384
01:42:50,980 --> 01:42:59,980
should not have to reserve that crap. I can't be sure of that, though. Where did you hear

1385
01:42:59,980 --> 01:43:05,340
it, though? Did you hear it at a store that does reservations? Yeah, first I heard it

1386
01:43:05,340 --> 01:43:08,900
online in Game Facts, which I'm like, whatever, I don't really believe you. Then I went to

1387
01:43:08,900 --> 01:43:12,840
a store, and they said, yeah, we're not allowed to take any cores, because they're sending

1388
01:43:12,840 --> 01:43:16,640
all the cores out to the stores and we're getting all the premiums, trying to get all

1389
01:43:16,640 --> 01:43:18,520
the pre-orders up.

1390
01:43:18,520 --> 01:43:22,180
I have this weird feeling, I hope it's not true or I'm going to be pissed. I cannot imagine

1391
01:43:22,180 --> 01:43:25,600
a huge chain like Best Buy that they would screw over somebody like Best Buy or Toys

1392
01:43:25,600 --> 01:43:31,920
R Us with that. I don't know, maybe we'll call Microsoft on the podcast or something

1393
01:43:31,920 --> 01:43:35,280
if it wasn't so late on a Sunday night they were open. I swear we'd call somebody and

1394
01:43:35,280 --> 01:43:40,360
try to figure it out. I have a feeling it's false, but we'll see. If it does turn out

1395
01:43:40,360 --> 01:43:45,640
to be true, I'm gonna be pissed. Yeah, you can still reserve it, but I don't think you're

1396
01:43:45,640 --> 01:43:51,880
guaranteed it until next year sometimes. What a crap. What a bunch of crap. I will get one

1397
01:43:51,880 --> 01:43:57,640
launch day, just you wait. We'll see. Or I might come back on this show and say, fuck

1398
01:43:57,640 --> 01:44:02,960
Microsoft, I hate them. Alright. I'm gonna let you go now, bud, okay? Okay. Alright,

1399
01:44:02,960 --> 01:44:07,840
take care, have a good one. Alright. Later. Okay, we're gonna do one more call, and then

1400
01:44:07,840 --> 01:44:11,840
We're going to have to go over to the cage match, and then we might do some more calls

1401
01:44:11,840 --> 01:44:12,840
later.

1402
01:44:12,840 --> 01:44:13,840
But first, one more.

1403
01:44:13,840 --> 01:44:14,840
Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio.

1404
01:44:14,840 --> 01:44:15,840
Obviously, you already know who this is.

1405
01:44:15,840 --> 01:44:16,840
Hey, Zaku, what's on your mind?

1406
01:44:16,840 --> 01:44:26,800
I'm posting up a link right now that pretty much might be of your interest.

1407
01:44:26,800 --> 01:44:31,000
Some of you might hate it, some of you might say, what the fuck am I doing?

1408
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:32,000
But here we go.

1409
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:38,000
It's from CDR's Week in New York forums, but I think you'll see what I'm trying to tell you.

1410
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:41,000
Okay, so give us a description of it while it loads on the computers here.

1411
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:46,000
Alright, basically, MTV wants New York City TDR players.

1412
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:54,000
Don't know why, but this dude who was probably recruited by them is seeking our kind.

1413
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:59,000
Hmm, okay, so if you live in the New York area, let's see.

1414
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:02,360
New York City, sorry, New York City.

1415
01:45:02,360 --> 01:45:06,960
Somebody was recently contacted by MTV direct effects casting director to

1416
01:45:06,960 --> 01:45:10,320
film an episode based on video gaming culture.

1417
01:45:10,320 --> 01:45:14,000
They have to round up fifty to sixty gamers from New York City that are unique, outgoing,

1418
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,360
who basically break the stereotype

1419
01:45:16,360 --> 01:45:19,720
of the anti-social gamer geek. Hey, too bad they're on the

1420
01:45:19,720 --> 01:45:21,560
east coast. We'd have

1421
01:45:21,560 --> 01:45:24,240
something fun for them here in California.

1422
01:45:24,240 --> 01:45:28,440
As you can see in the thread, I've already signed up as well as several other prominent players.

1423
01:45:28,440 --> 01:45:36,440
They already called me back that same day, and MTV is supposed to be calling me soon

1424
01:45:36,440 --> 01:45:37,440
about the interview date.

1425
01:45:37,440 --> 01:45:38,440
Awesome.

1426
01:45:38,440 --> 01:45:41,440
We'll drop our name a whole bunch, all right?

1427
01:45:41,440 --> 01:45:42,440
We'll see.

1428
01:45:42,440 --> 01:45:43,440
I'm just messing with you.

1429
01:45:43,440 --> 01:45:44,440
Have fun with it.

1430
01:45:44,440 --> 01:45:45,440
Have fun with it.

1431
01:45:45,440 --> 01:45:46,440
That's great news.

1432
01:45:46,440 --> 01:45:48,440
Yeah, that's basically what they want.

1433
01:45:48,440 --> 01:45:57,440
They want sociable and outgoing people to just break that stereotype, which is basically

1434
01:45:57,440 --> 01:46:04,220
what we are in a nutshell.

1435
01:46:04,220 --> 01:46:10,980
As far as UltraMix III songs go, freestylers are fine, that's all you need to know.

1436
01:46:10,980 --> 01:46:19,180
If we were able a couple of weeks ago to hook up a PS2 to a DDR machine and use it as such,

1437
01:46:19,180 --> 01:46:23,220
we could probably do the same thing for an Xbox and pour out the songs for freestyle

1438
01:46:23,220 --> 01:46:24,220
routines.

1439
01:46:24,220 --> 01:46:29,460
Oh yeah, it's going to be great for freestyle people, so it's got such a solid song list.

1440
01:46:29,460 --> 01:46:33,500
If we could get it, that's if we could, you know, hook up an Xbox to a DER machine in

1441
01:46:33,500 --> 01:46:34,500
about a year.

1442
01:46:34,500 --> 01:46:35,820
You never know.

1443
01:46:35,820 --> 01:46:36,820
You never know.

1444
01:46:36,820 --> 01:46:37,820
Mm-hmm.

1445
01:46:37,820 --> 01:46:38,820
Okay, okay.

1446
01:46:38,820 --> 01:46:43,020
Well, good luck with the MTV thing, and you know, I don't really watch MTV, but I'll make

1447
01:46:43,020 --> 01:46:44,020
an exception.

1448
01:46:44,020 --> 01:46:46,820
If you get on it, I'll TiVo it or something.

1449
01:46:46,820 --> 01:46:50,060
I just, yeah, I just hope, I just hope I get in.

1450
01:46:50,060 --> 01:46:51,060
All right.

1451
01:46:51,060 --> 01:46:59,060
Yeah, it was probably in a few weeks anyway, so as I said, watch out, I might be on TV.

1452
01:46:59,060 --> 01:47:04,060
If I am, just, you know, you'll probably mention it on Sunday.

1453
01:47:04,060 --> 01:47:08,060
Maybe. We might. No, I'm kidding. We would. We would.

1454
01:47:08,060 --> 01:47:13,060
Well, good luck with that, and, you know, again, name drop a lot. Orange Lounge. Love it. No, I'm just kidding.

1455
01:47:13,060 --> 01:47:14,060
Have a good one, all right?

1456
01:47:14,060 --> 01:47:15,060
Got an open one?

1457
01:47:15,060 --> 01:47:18,060
I gotta let you go so we can get more calls.

1458
01:47:18,060 --> 01:47:19,060
All right, bye.

1459
01:47:19,060 --> 01:47:20,060
Later.

1460
01:47:20,060 --> 01:47:22,780
He's going to be on the TV.

1461
01:47:22,780 --> 01:47:24,460
You know, some of us are going to be on the TV.

1462
01:47:24,460 --> 01:47:28,660
I'm not going to be on the TV, but some of us are going to be on the TV here locally.

1463
01:47:28,660 --> 01:47:35,300
Next week, on the 8th, doing a Guitar Hero review on one of the stations here in Sacramento.

1464
01:47:35,300 --> 01:47:36,860
All right.

1465
01:47:36,860 --> 01:47:39,700
Actually looking at the time, I think what we're going to do is actually go into this

1466
01:47:39,700 --> 01:47:40,700
nice cage match.

1467
01:47:40,700 --> 01:47:43,500
We need to get into that or we're going to run out of time.

1468
01:47:43,500 --> 01:47:45,200
So let's go ahead and get it started.

1469
01:47:45,200 --> 01:47:47,200
the Orange Lounge Radio cage match.

1470
01:47:47,200 --> 01:47:51,680
The way the cage match works, you have to be in our chat room.

1471
01:47:51,680 --> 01:47:56,760
If you want to participate, www.orangeloungeradio.com, click on Chat.

1472
01:47:56,760 --> 01:47:59,440
And the way the cage match works, we're going to play three songs for you guys.

1473
01:47:59,440 --> 01:48:03,460
Each host picks a song, and you guys are going to vote for your favorite.

1474
01:48:03,460 --> 01:48:07,560
And the winning song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's Flamani

1475
01:48:07,560 --> 01:48:12,520
and Video Game Music program, which plays 24 hours a day, 7 days a week on this station.

1476
01:48:12,520 --> 01:48:18,220
number one tonight is going for its fourth week win. If it wins tonight, it

1477
01:48:18,220 --> 01:48:23,440
will be retired. It will be only the, I think, fifth song to be retired out of

1478
01:48:23,440 --> 01:48:27,240
Orange Lawn Radio's cage match in this couple years we've been doing this. So

1479
01:48:27,240 --> 01:48:31,460
here it is. It's song number four. It wasn't even really picked by one of us. I

1480
01:48:31,460 --> 01:48:36,100
mean, I put it in, but I put it in on behalf of Miklotov, so just kind of

1481
01:48:36,100 --> 01:48:38,940
interesting the way that works out. So this would be the first song that we get

1482
01:48:38,940 --> 01:48:43,380
retired that was not even put in by one of us so be very interesting to see what

1483
01:48:43,380 --> 01:48:48,960
happens so here it is it's song number one going for its fourth win in a row

1484
01:48:48,960 --> 01:48:55,960
So will it be retired? It's up to you. Pendulum withholds your color.

1485
01:49:18,960 --> 01:49:42,080
So can't figure out how to cut the castle open

1486
01:49:42,080 --> 01:49:47,580
They take everything away

1487
01:49:47,580 --> 01:49:55,080
And those who cares, they can't do all of that

1488
01:49:55,080 --> 01:49:57,080
They take everything away

1489
01:49:57,080 --> 01:50:25,560
You look into your eyes, and so I lay her knee

1490
01:50:25,560 --> 01:50:31,320
Don't try to save yourself, Mr. Hall is gonna reach

1491
01:50:31,320 --> 01:50:35,720
We're not reaching out and to see you

1492
01:50:35,720 --> 01:50:40,440
Nothing else can touch me

1493
01:50:40,440 --> 01:50:43,240
So can't find the hope

1494
01:50:43,240 --> 01:50:47,800
Who comes against the road

1495
01:50:47,800 --> 01:50:53,640
When they take everything away

1496
01:50:53,640 --> 01:51:21,640
All right, let's get to it.

1497
01:51:21,640 --> 01:51:25,800
Alright, let's get into song number two tonight.

1498
01:51:25,800 --> 01:51:28,400
Song number two is Dark Sakura's Pick.

1499
01:51:28,400 --> 01:51:30,880
Dark Sakura, what did you pick for us?

1500
01:51:30,880 --> 01:51:32,880
Um, it's...

1501
01:51:32,880 --> 01:51:35,640
Here, use mine.

1502
01:51:35,640 --> 01:51:37,920
It's OG Bitch.

1503
01:51:37,920 --> 01:51:40,240
OG Bitch by Estero.

1504
01:51:40,240 --> 01:51:41,240
Huh?

1505
01:51:41,240 --> 01:51:42,240
Remixed.

1506
01:51:42,240 --> 01:51:46,520
Any particular reason you picked a song called OG Bitch?

1507
01:51:46,520 --> 01:51:47,520
I just like Estero.

1508
01:51:47,520 --> 01:51:50,640
Alright, here it is, song number two, Estero.

1509
01:51:50,640 --> 01:51:57,520
It dethroned pendulum. We'll see a sterile with og bitch the orange factory mix. So how appropriate we back up this

1510
01:53:50,640 --> 01:53:57,640
You're just waiting for me to drown, So no one knows that you stole my whole sound,

1511
01:53:57,640 --> 01:54:04,640
And yet you're grinning when I come around, So no one knows that you stole my whole sound,

1512
01:54:04,640 --> 01:54:08,640
And yet you're grinning when I come around,

1513
01:54:08,640 --> 01:54:29,920
I know, I know you love me, yeah, yeah I know, I know you love me, yeah, yeah

1514
01:54:59,920 --> 01:55:18,320
Alright, uttering her first words on the new microphone, Dark Sakura will let us know how

1515
01:55:18,320 --> 01:55:19,840
she liked OG Bitch.

1516
01:55:19,840 --> 01:55:20,840
Nine.

1517
01:55:20,840 --> 01:55:22,840
It's a nine from Dark Sakura.

1518
01:55:22,840 --> 01:55:25,040
Yeah, I think it went through.

1519
01:55:25,040 --> 01:55:27,680
Dark Sakura, give us a sentence.

1520
01:55:27,680 --> 01:55:28,680
I like Doritos.

1521
01:55:28,680 --> 01:55:40,280
p0k3smot42o

1522
01:55:40,280 --> 01:55:50,280
p0k3smot42o

1523
01:55:50,280 --> 01:55:54,280
because I had a cool beat to it. Like, I liked the remix. I'm not so sure I was up on the

1524
01:55:54,280 --> 01:55:59,280
singing, because the singing kind of had this kind of weird thing to it, but it was cool.

1525
01:55:59,280 --> 01:56:05,280
I mean, it's the song I could see myself getting down at the club, OG clubbing, so I give it

1526
01:56:05,280 --> 01:56:07,280
an 8. That's pretty good.

1527
01:56:07,280 --> 01:56:09,280
Extifer, what did you think?

1528
01:56:09,280 --> 01:56:16,280
Um, she didn't sound like a gangsta, but I will give it a 5, because I don't know what

1529
01:56:16,280 --> 01:56:19,280
to think. I'm purely in the middle on that one.

1530
01:56:19,280 --> 01:56:25,280
Angel. I liked the beat to it, it was pretty neat. Um, six.

1531
01:56:25,280 --> 01:56:31,280
Alright. Song number three tonight, going up against Estro and Pendulum is...

1532
01:56:31,280 --> 01:56:33,280
Loki, what you put in?

1533
01:56:33,280 --> 01:56:38,280
You know, this is just one of those weeks where I had nothing really to put in.

1534
01:56:38,280 --> 01:56:46,280
So this song will go out to Captain Jack being dead and all, but um, this is actually, I think out of all the songs I've listened to him,

1535
01:56:46,280 --> 01:56:52,680
best thumbs up, you know, kind of the mood with him being, you know, dead and everything.

1536
01:56:52,680 --> 01:56:58,280
But, um, it's also really strange. It's a really strange song. I'm saying all votes go to Pendulum

1537
01:56:58,280 --> 01:57:02,180
because that's a fucking awesome song, but here you go. It's something to fill up.

1538
01:57:02,180 --> 01:57:04,180
I don't know, you're going for the sympathy vote tonight.

1539
01:57:04,180 --> 01:57:09,180
I'm not even hoping to get any votes, but, you know, because the song I want to put in was too long

1540
01:57:09,180 --> 01:57:12,180
and I didn't want to cut it down, so, anyway.

1541
01:57:12,180 --> 01:57:19,180
Let's see. Song number three, going out to the man, Captain Jack. It's Captain Jack with Back Home. Enjoy.

1542
01:57:42,180 --> 01:57:57,540
The captain wants to be back home And the captain fights against the storm

1543
01:57:57,540 --> 01:58:03,380
He's always true to gifts He always wants to live and be back home

1544
01:58:03,380 --> 01:58:10,980
It was a lonely night with a pack full of dreams

1545
01:58:10,980 --> 01:58:13,620
Miles away from home, I felt cold and at ease

1546
01:58:13,620 --> 01:58:17,980
As if I was the only human being on Earth I thought about the soldiers and the peace

1547
01:58:17,980 --> 01:58:21,380
can't spare Couldn't stop thinking about my company

1548
01:58:21,380 --> 01:58:27,220
About coming home, life and history How everything started with Captain Jack

1549
01:58:27,220 --> 01:58:28,220
When will I meet you?

1550
01:58:28,220 --> 01:58:29,220
When will I be back?

1551
01:58:29,220 --> 01:58:35,220
Try, try hard, get the best you can So never stop fighting for the peace in your land

1552
01:58:35,220 --> 01:58:40,220
Come together and see the light All for one, like a stick of dynamite

1553
01:58:40,220 --> 01:58:50,220
The captain wants to be back home And the captain fights against the storm

1554
01:58:50,220 --> 01:58:59,220
He always wants to live and be back home

1555
01:58:59,220 --> 01:59:04,220
After hours and hours of marching through the land

1556
01:59:04,220 --> 01:59:07,220
There was something in the air, velvet flower in my hand

1557
01:59:07,220 --> 01:59:10,220
The grass was green and the moon shined bright

1558
01:59:10,220 --> 01:59:12,220
Remembered that night when she held me tight

1559
01:59:12,220 --> 01:59:15,220
I went down to the river to the water bottle

1560
01:59:15,220 --> 01:59:18,220
Took hours long for my belly for the crazy couple

1561
01:59:18,220 --> 01:59:20,720
One morning came and I reached the can

1562
01:59:20,720 --> 01:59:23,720
I took a break and laid down in the warm white sand

1563
01:59:23,720 --> 01:59:26,220
So try, try hard and get the best you can

1564
01:59:26,220 --> 01:59:28,720
Never stop fighting for the peace in our land

1565
01:59:28,720 --> 01:59:31,720
Come together and see the light

1566
01:59:31,720 --> 01:59:34,220
All for one like a stick of dynamite

1567
01:59:34,220 --> 01:59:39,220
The captain wants to be back home

1568
01:59:39,220 --> 01:59:43,720
And the captain fights against the storm

1569
01:59:43,720 --> 01:59:45,220
Fight against

1570
01:59:45,220 --> 01:59:47,720
His own ways to the game

1571
01:59:47,720 --> 01:59:51,720
He always wants to live and be back home

1572
01:59:55,720 --> 01:59:59,720
The captain wants to be back home

1573
02:00:00,720 --> 02:00:04,720
And the captain is feeling all alone

1574
02:00:06,720 --> 02:00:08,720
He's always true to me

1575
02:00:08,720 --> 02:00:13,720
He always wants to live and be back home

1576
02:00:17,720 --> 02:00:19,720
Tack, tack, tack, never looking back

1577
02:00:19,720 --> 02:00:22,720
Come and fight for Captain Jack

1578
02:00:22,720 --> 02:00:25,720
Say it slow, but say it loud

1579
02:00:25,720 --> 02:00:27,720
Join the peace camp and you'll be proud

1580
02:00:27,720 --> 02:00:30,720
Jump and walk, train and talk

1581
02:00:30,720 --> 02:00:33,720
Move your body, you're not a piece of talk

1582
02:00:33,720 --> 02:00:35,720
Scream and shout, call out my name

1583
02:00:35,720 --> 02:00:38,720
It's Captain Jess, straight back again

1584
02:00:38,720 --> 02:00:43,720
The Captain wants to be back home

1585
02:00:43,720 --> 02:00:48,720
And the Captain fights against us all

1586
02:00:48,720 --> 02:00:49,720
He fights against us all

1587
02:00:49,720 --> 02:00:52,720
He's always true to give

1588
02:00:52,720 --> 02:00:56,720
He always wants to live and be back home

1589
02:00:59,720 --> 02:01:00,720
Ooh-ooh

1590
02:01:00,720 --> 02:01:04,720
The Captain wants to be back home

1591
02:01:04,720 --> 02:01:18,720
And the captain is feeling all alone He's always true to give He always wants to live and be back home

1592
02:01:18,720 --> 02:01:32,720
The captain wants to be back home And the captain fights against the storm

1593
02:01:32,720 --> 02:01:43,720
He's always trying to get He always wants to live and be back home

1594
02:01:43,720 --> 02:01:48,720
The captain wants to be back home

1595
02:01:48,720 --> 02:01:53,720
And the captain is feeling all alone

1596
02:01:53,720 --> 02:01:56,720
He's always trying to get

1597
02:01:56,720 --> 02:02:01,720
Your place wants to never be that old

1598
02:02:26,720 --> 02:02:44,860
Song number three in tonight's case match, Captain Jack with Back Home, the captain's

1599
02:02:44,860 --> 02:02:45,860
remix.

1600
02:02:45,860 --> 02:02:49,880
Dark Sakura, what did you think of that tribute that Loki picked there for Captain Jack?

1601
02:02:49,880 --> 02:02:52,680
I'm presently bleeding out of my ear from brain hemorrhage.

1602
02:02:52,680 --> 02:02:55,800
Careful, I think that's what Captain Jack died of.

1603
02:02:55,800 --> 02:02:58,840
I know, this one gets two.

1604
02:02:58,840 --> 02:03:02,880
A two from Dark Sakura? Loki!

1605
02:03:02,880 --> 02:03:06,380
You know, I don't know, it just

1606
02:03:06,380 --> 02:03:11,320
is a weird song. I think the song, like, was okay until he started

1607
02:03:11,320 --> 02:03:14,520
doing his, like, rapping or whatever that is.

1608
02:03:14,520 --> 02:03:18,180
Um, it gets, like, a seven

1609
02:03:18,180 --> 02:03:24,200
for the mindbase who's been dead. Actually, I have to, I have to say, his rapping reminded me of, like,

1610
02:03:24,200 --> 02:03:26,520
new edition in ronie

1611
02:03:26,520 --> 02:03:28,880
with like bobby brown trying to rap

1612
02:03:28,880 --> 02:03:30,160
kinda

1613
02:03:30,160 --> 02:03:33,560
i don't know, like i said, throw away songs to where

1614
02:03:33,560 --> 02:03:40,560
uh... you know what song that was? you know that song kinda reminded me of something else?

1615
02:03:44,740 --> 02:03:49,920
i like that song. and that song sucked too. i like it. sorry, you know what?

1616
02:03:49,920 --> 02:03:51,240
captain jack was the man

1617
02:03:51,240 --> 02:03:53,400
but he needs to stick to barking orders

1618
02:03:53,400 --> 02:03:56,260
because that's what i want to pay attention i don't like

1619
02:03:56,260 --> 02:03:58,580
i don't like and picked anything i don't like that

1620
02:03:58,580 --> 02:04:02,760
but i don't like that with the captain jack in that time i like that sorry

1621
02:04:02,760 --> 02:04:06,540
but i think that he brought a record and yes sir yes sir yes sir

1622
02:04:06,540 --> 02:04:09,980
i will party down right now

1623
02:04:09,980 --> 02:04:15,080
there is a song that's actually on the theme cd that it's called uh...

1624
02:04:15,080 --> 02:04:17,520
highland was called after yesterday

1625
02:04:17,520 --> 02:04:20,580
it's not like that and it's about like captain jack

1626
02:04:20,580 --> 02:04:23,580
I'm gonna beat down the soldiers if they don't listen to him.

1627
02:04:23,580 --> 02:04:30,580
There you go. That's the Captain Jack I like. I don't like this Captain Jack wah wah wah. I'm going home wah wah.

1628
02:04:30,580 --> 02:04:35,580
All right, anyway, Extrovert, what did you think? Oh, I give it a 2 plus 1 is 3.

1629
02:04:35,580 --> 02:04:37,580
Extrovert, what did you think?

1630
02:04:37,580 --> 02:04:45,580
That's the kind of song that I'd like to listen at the stroke of 1130 when I'm about to go to sleep at night.

1631
02:04:45,580 --> 02:04:53,700
Suddenly I'll wake up, you know, in the hospital surrounded by my hot bitches as I'm flipping

1632
02:04:53,700 --> 02:04:54,700
into my coma.

1633
02:04:54,700 --> 02:05:00,100
Wait, hold on, I need to check with the judges.

1634
02:05:00,100 --> 02:05:04,540
Judges, are we allowed to be insensitive after only a week?

1635
02:05:04,540 --> 02:05:05,540
I don't know.

1636
02:05:05,540 --> 02:05:06,540
Is that politically correct?

1637
02:05:06,540 --> 02:05:07,540
Yes.

1638
02:05:07,540 --> 02:05:12,060
I was never really sensitive to begin with, so I'm kind of...

1639
02:05:12,060 --> 02:05:14,060
Please try not to piss off the listeners.

1640
02:05:14,060 --> 02:05:15,060
Hi, listeners.

1641
02:05:15,060 --> 02:05:25,060
I will give it an 8, because I think that this song should win over the pendulum song that has been, like, winning.

1642
02:05:25,060 --> 02:05:27,060
Don't forget about the OG bitch!

1643
02:05:27,060 --> 02:05:30,060
Um, no, I don't know. She didn't sound like a gangsta.

1644
02:05:30,060 --> 02:05:34,060
That's a whole... I'm not... I'm all for...

1645
02:05:34,060 --> 02:05:36,060
But Captain Jack is an OG bitch.

1646
02:05:36,060 --> 02:05:39,060
I'm all for the true Compton gangstas, okay?

1647
02:05:39,060 --> 02:05:44,060
I like Compton gangstas, not Mexican Latina gangstas.

1648
02:05:44,060 --> 02:05:47,060
Alright, Angel, what did you think?

1649
02:05:48,060 --> 02:06:00,060
It kind of reminded me of like the 80's, like, not so much love song stuff, but like, I don't know, like R&B love song type, I don't know.

1650
02:06:00,060 --> 02:06:01,060
The crappy songs, Angel.

1651
02:06:01,060 --> 02:06:03,060
Yeah, that'll work.

1652
02:06:08,060 --> 02:06:12,060
Oh, I'll be nice, I guess. Give it a 6.

1653
02:06:12,060 --> 02:06:18,260
All right, let's recap. It's not up to us, it's up to you. You folks in chatroom, get

1654
02:06:18,260 --> 02:06:22,380
your say. The three songs you can vote for tonight. Song number one, Pendulum, hold your

1655
02:06:22,380 --> 02:06:33,240
color. And song number two you can vote for tonight is Estero with OG Bitch, the Orange

1656
02:06:33,240 --> 02:06:40,240
factory mix.

1657
02:06:41,640 --> 02:06:45,680
And song number three you can vote for tonight is Captain Jack with

1658
02:06:45,680 --> 02:06:52,680
Back Home.

1659
02:06:52,680 --> 02:06:59,680
After hours and hours of listening to that song, my brain is hemorrhaging all night.

1660
02:07:22,680 --> 02:07:29,320
those who didn't know it, um, WOOOOO! Sorry, I'm just really excited. Okay. Well, what's

1661
02:07:29,320 --> 02:07:33,120
cool about that is there's more sim stuff it seems like on DDR Maniacs than there was

1662
02:07:33,120 --> 02:07:37,580
on Bomani's style. A lot more stuff that's going into like theme development and stuff

1663
02:07:37,580 --> 02:07:44,580
like that. Plus you can get downloadable characters for Cloud and Tifa. Whoopsie-doo. Um, anyways,

1664
02:07:44,580 --> 02:07:51,080
um, the big thing that I was looking for, and trying to find a link, um, to, but unfortunately

1665
02:07:51,080 --> 02:08:01,080
the pages down right now is, for the PSP, it's Beatmania BMS Player and DDR BMS Player.

1666
02:08:01,080 --> 02:08:06,500
And these are both for the PSP. They have a video or sort of a little animation on their

1667
02:08:06,500 --> 02:08:13,840
site right now showing the DDR one in action with full background videos and it looks pretty

1668
02:08:13,840 --> 02:08:20,540
cool so far. Unfortunately, all the links are down for it right now. And the Beatmania

1669
02:08:20,540 --> 02:08:25,180
one is available right now. I tried downloading it to my PSP, but I can't get it to play anything,

1670
02:08:25,180 --> 02:08:30,700
so both of these are still a work in progress right now. Anyways, if you're interested in

1671
02:08:30,700 --> 02:08:40,060
the link, I will post it in the chat room. Sweet. Is that it? That's pretty much it for

1672
02:08:40,060 --> 02:08:47,380
now. Other than that, Bill Mice still is back up too. Are they still begging for money?

1673
02:08:47,380 --> 02:08:48,380
me?

1674
02:08:48,380 --> 02:08:49,380
I'm sure.

1675
02:08:49,380 --> 02:08:50,380
Okay.

1676
02:08:50,380 --> 02:08:51,380
No.

1677
02:08:51,380 --> 02:08:52,380
No.

1678
02:08:52,380 --> 02:08:55,380
They're putting up more media stuff right now, like Simphile stuff.

1679
02:08:55,380 --> 02:08:56,380
Good times.

1680
02:08:56,380 --> 02:08:57,380
Time.

1681
02:08:57,380 --> 02:08:58,380
Yeah.

1682
02:08:58,380 --> 02:08:59,380
Oh.

1683
02:08:59,380 --> 02:09:00,380
Oh.

1684
02:09:00,380 --> 02:09:02,380
I forgot to check and see if they had more Simphiles up there for MaxRemix.

1685
02:09:02,380 --> 02:09:03,380
Oh.

1686
02:09:03,380 --> 02:09:04,380
Goody.

1687
02:09:04,380 --> 02:09:05,380
Just what the world needs, more MaxRemixes.

1688
02:09:05,380 --> 02:09:09,660
I don't think that their Simphiles are up quite yet, but I'm sure that pretty soon they

1689
02:09:09,660 --> 02:09:10,660
will be.

1690
02:09:10,660 --> 02:09:16,380
I know that actually you can go on ddrmaniax.net.

1691
02:09:16,380 --> 02:09:22,920
They have a build in progress right now for StepMania 4, which is almost done.

1692
02:09:22,920 --> 02:09:25,320
So that should be pretty cool.

1693
02:09:25,320 --> 02:09:34,680
But yeah, Simfile database, not too much right now for that, but I'm thinking though, I mean

1694
02:09:34,680 --> 02:09:41,340
they've already got some Rave songs in there and I'm sure there'll be Max remixes in here

1695
02:09:41,340 --> 02:09:42,340
pretty soon.

1696
02:09:42,340 --> 02:09:44,080
Hey wait a minute, I thought that Mindstyle was gonna have this whole new look when it

1697
02:09:44,080 --> 02:09:45,080
came back.

1698
02:09:45,080 --> 02:09:46,080
It looks the same.

1699
02:09:46,080 --> 02:09:56,080
Well, apparently not. Apparently they lied to us, much like they lied to me when I donated money and said I was going to get special access to an FTP site that never happened.

1700
02:09:56,080 --> 02:09:57,080
Okay.

1701
02:09:57,080 --> 02:09:58,080
So that's why I never donate to them.

1702
02:09:58,080 --> 02:09:59,080
Just curious.

1703
02:09:59,080 --> 02:10:03,080
Oh, oh, here we go. Rave Unlimited. There you go. Max Unlimited remix. Okay.

1704
02:10:03,080 --> 02:10:05,080
Ooh, just what the world needs.

1705
02:10:05,080 --> 02:10:12,320
Alright, now we're going to get to the part of the show where we ask our buddy Xtopher

1706
02:10:12,320 --> 02:10:14,920
to come on and tell us about the movies.

1707
02:10:14,920 --> 02:10:16,320
Did you see a movie this week?

1708
02:10:16,320 --> 02:10:17,320
I did see a movie this week.

1709
02:10:17,320 --> 02:10:20,920
Alright, then you know it's time for Xtopher's Movie Review.

1710
02:10:20,920 --> 02:10:27,800
The Captain, the Captain.

1711
02:10:27,800 --> 02:10:30,440
I just wanted to go, like, stop it.

1712
02:10:30,440 --> 02:10:31,440
Stop playing that song.

1713
02:10:31,440 --> 02:10:32,440
Stop it.

1714
02:10:32,440 --> 02:10:34,440
Okay, so what did you see this week?

1715
02:10:34,440 --> 02:10:46,440
Okay, so I saw Saw 2 and it was bloody. If you like blood and if you like to be scared,

1716
02:10:46,440 --> 02:10:52,440
then Saw 2 is the movie to see. I really was scared. I was genuinely scared at this movie.

1717
02:10:52,440 --> 02:10:56,440
I'm easily scared though at films, so I mean just don't take that from me.

1718
02:10:56,440 --> 02:11:00,440
I mean you may want to take a look at the reviews on RottenTomato.com.

1719
02:11:00,440 --> 02:11:10,440
got like really horrible reviews. I don't know, I've never seen Saw 1, so I've never

1720
02:11:10,440 --> 02:11:22,040
I never saw that, although I want to see Saw for Christmas. But no, it was really cool.

1721
02:11:22,040 --> 02:11:28,380
My sister saw the first one, and she had filled me in on most of the first one before we saw

1722
02:11:28,380 --> 02:11:32,140
the film but i didn't expect the beginning i just didn't like my mouth

1723
02:11:32,140 --> 02:11:36,620
was open i was just like i was horrified it was it was really scary to me

1724
02:11:36,620 --> 02:11:41,820
but um again i'm i'm kind of a pussy when it comes to scary movies rob you

1725
02:11:41,820 --> 02:11:45,660
should know that oh my god yes um oh my god but uh i'm surprised you'll wet your

1726
02:11:45,660 --> 02:11:50,700
pants um at this movie you i've never told you if i have or not i might have

1727
02:11:50,700 --> 02:11:55,740
no kidding um no uh not really i am

1728
02:11:55,740 --> 02:11:59,180
kind of impressed by it i thought it was like silent hill i thought it looked

1729
02:11:59,180 --> 02:12:02,900
like so i had a look at the site looking feel a silent hill the way that it was

1730
02:12:02,900 --> 02:12:06,100
all set up in everything now the other thing about this movie that is incredibly

1731
02:12:06,100 --> 02:12:10,500
extremely and horribly violent like seriously ryland like

1732
02:12:10,500 --> 02:12:11,660
fucking violent

1733
02:12:11,660 --> 02:12:13,480
it is very violent people

1734
02:12:13,480 --> 02:12:15,140
people bleeding all over the place

1735
02:12:15,140 --> 02:12:19,440
but the way the way that places in the way the place looks is just exactly like

1736
02:12:19,440 --> 02:12:22,060
something you see right out of that video game

1737
02:12:22,060 --> 02:12:24,780
and um... i just was very

1738
02:12:24,780 --> 02:12:27,180
very like, just, it was just hard to watch.

1739
02:12:27,180 --> 02:12:29,900
Why don't you tell me something about, like, a trap?

1740
02:12:29,900 --> 02:12:33,860
I don't know if it's a spoiler, but you're saying, like, a trap where razor blades are

1741
02:12:33,860 --> 02:12:35,580
cutting off somebody's arm or something?

1742
02:12:35,580 --> 02:12:36,580
Yeah, it's like...

1743
02:12:36,580 --> 02:12:37,580
It's disgusting.

1744
02:12:37,580 --> 02:12:42,340
It's like a plexiglass box with two openings, and you see, the whole premise is these people

1745
02:12:42,340 --> 02:12:48,020
are poisoned, and they have to find their antidotes to this toxin that they've been

1746
02:12:48,020 --> 02:12:53,280
breathing in for, like, you know, the last two hours, and they're trying to find them

1747
02:12:53,280 --> 02:12:58,540
throughout this house and one of the girls walks into a room with this plexiglass box

1748
02:12:58,540 --> 02:13:03,460
like hanging from the ceiling with two openings where hands can go through and an antidote

1749
02:13:03,460 --> 02:13:09,780
like a, you know, a syringe is in the middle just standing up and she, they're all, you

1750
02:13:09,780 --> 02:13:16,780
know, totally fu- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1751
02:13:16,780 --> 02:13:22,780
Jamie's about to die from my story. How does it fucking feel to want?

1752
02:13:22,780 --> 02:13:26,780
It's my review, dammit.

1753
02:13:26,780 --> 02:13:28,780
No, I...

1754
02:13:28,780 --> 02:13:30,780
Bloody, bloody, et cetera.

1755
02:13:30,780 --> 02:13:34,780
You know, that's pretty much... I'll talk about it tomorrow. How's about that?

1756
02:13:34,780 --> 02:13:37,780
Okay. Don't listen to my show tomorrow.

1757
02:13:37,780 --> 02:13:39,780
Talk to... or Jamie.

1758
02:13:39,780 --> 02:13:43,780
But no. But listen, because, you know, you want to.

1759
02:13:43,780 --> 02:13:47,780
And so I actually recommend it. I mean, if you don't like...

1760
02:13:47,780 --> 02:13:51,780
If you like violence to the level of pornography level.

1761
02:13:51,780 --> 02:13:55,580
It wasn't, but the thing is, I didn't really pay attention to the blood.

1762
02:13:55,580 --> 02:13:56,580
I was genuinely...

1763
02:13:56,580 --> 02:13:59,100
So if you like the guinea pig project, you'll like Saw 2?

1764
02:13:59,100 --> 02:14:02,980
If you like faces of death, you'll probably like Saw 2.

1765
02:14:02,980 --> 02:14:04,980
No, no, no, no, no.

1766
02:14:04,980 --> 02:14:07,260
It was more scary than gory to me.

1767
02:14:07,260 --> 02:14:11,900
I mean, sure, there was blood, you know, and that's just a given in a movie like that,

1768
02:14:11,900 --> 02:14:15,160
but like, it was more, it was scary to me.

1769
02:14:15,160 --> 02:14:18,140
But yeah, it was a good Halloween movie.

1770
02:14:18,140 --> 02:14:19,140
Happy Halloween!

1771
02:14:19,140 --> 02:14:20,140
So, thumbs up?

1772
02:14:20,140 --> 02:14:21,660
Um, thumbs up for me.

1773
02:14:21,660 --> 02:14:28,780
thumbs cut off really um most likely two stumps up all right all right anyway

1774
02:14:28,780 --> 02:14:33,380
we're gonna go to another break and in this break we're gonna hear some stuff

1775
02:14:33,380 --> 02:14:38,020
from since one of our callers earlier brought up a DDR with Mario I suppose we

1776
02:14:38,020 --> 02:14:41,980
could do some music from a DDR with Mario so we'll do that and we'll be back

1777
02:14:41,980 --> 02:14:46,720
with more Orange Lounge Radio right after this and maybe some more Skype

1778
02:14:46,720 --> 02:14:49,220
calls we can get into it we also definitely have to do the FUs of the

1779
02:14:49,220 --> 02:14:56,060
week and do the cage match winner as well so we'll be number three we'll see

1780
02:14:56,060 --> 02:15:01,060
we'll see all right we'll be back after this with some DDO and Mario music and

1781
02:15:01,060 --> 02:15:08,060
Norges Launch Radio.

1782
02:18:01,060 --> 02:18:03,060
Thanks for watching!

1783
02:20:01,060 --> 02:20:26,980
Here we go!

1784
02:20:56,980 --> 02:21:15,460
Orange Lounge Radio, we put your thing down, flip it and reverse it.

1785
02:21:15,460 --> 02:21:25,660
Hi kids, we're back here on Orange Lounge Radio, we're about ready to reveal who won

1786
02:21:25,660 --> 02:21:36,540
tonight's cage match we like to tell you about some of the other programming here

1787
02:21:36,540 --> 02:21:39,800
on Orange Launch Radio I don't know if you guys are aware but last week we kind of

1788
02:21:39,800 --> 02:21:44,380
launched a couple new shows and so we got we're full of crap on Orange Launch

1789
02:21:44,380 --> 02:21:48,380
Radio now so we got a lot of live shows and it all starts tomorrow night with

1790
02:21:48,380 --> 02:21:54,340
Xtifer's case of the Mondays if you don't like Mondays and you're ready to

1791
02:21:54,340 --> 02:22:01,740

Tuesday nights on Orange Lounge Radio, the one and only Dark Sakura presents Pump Up

1818
02:24:00,060 --> 02:24:01,060
the Volume.

1819
02:24:01,060 --> 02:24:02,300
It's a music request show.

1820
02:24:02,300 --> 02:24:06,940
I've taken to doing it every other Tuesday just because it's cool.

1821
02:24:06,940 --> 02:24:08,380
So you're off this week actually, right?

1822
02:24:08,380 --> 02:24:12,620
This week I will be off, unless I get really bored, and then I might do something, so you

1823
02:24:12,620 --> 02:24:13,620
never know.

1824
02:24:13,620 --> 02:24:18,220
But the week after, I will be back live again.

1825
02:24:18,220 --> 02:24:24,580
And then Wednesday nights on the Orange Lounge radio is the Rob Roberts show, my program,

1826
02:24:24,580 --> 02:24:27,560
where we just kind of sit around and talk about stuff, like last week I went on this

1827
02:24:27,560 --> 02:24:31,780
rant about the future of television and stuff because of podcasting.

1828
02:24:31,780 --> 02:24:35,860
And so it's tech geek fun, and I just play music, and the music I play is whatever the

1829
02:24:35,860 --> 02:24:37,180
fuck I want.

1830
02:24:37,180 --> 02:24:41,660
This week's program, I'll have a very special guest on the show, Rice Princess is coming

1831
02:24:41,660 --> 02:24:43,200
back on Wednesday.

1832
02:24:43,200 --> 02:24:45,420
So it's a Vanilla Sky Reunion.

1833
02:24:45,420 --> 02:24:47,020
It should be a barrel of monkeys laughs.

1834
02:24:47,020 --> 02:24:48,400
It's going to be a fun show.

1835
02:24:48,400 --> 02:24:49,400
So tune in.

1836
02:24:49,400 --> 02:24:51,400

02:24:51,400 --> 02:24:55,860
Alright, anyway, moving on.

1838
02:24:55,860 --> 02:24:57,860
New topic, Cage Match.

1839
02:24:57,860 --> 02:25:00,820
Let's talk about who won tonight's Cage Match.

1840
02:25:00,820 --> 02:25:05,520
The winner of tonight's cage match was...

1841
02:25:05,520 --> 02:25:07,820
Drumroll. Xtopher, I need a drumroll.

1842
02:25:07,820 --> 02:25:09,820
Thank you.

1843
02:25:09,820 --> 02:25:12,820
The song that won tonight was...

1844
02:25:12,820 --> 02:25:16,820
Pendulum with Hold Your Color.

1845
02:25:16,820 --> 02:25:18,820
Fourth week.

1846
02:25:18,820 --> 02:25:20,820
Retired.

1847
02:25:20,820 --> 02:25:22,820
Retired!

1848
02:25:22,820 --> 02:25:25,820
That is so sad. I mean, you guys...

1849
02:25:25,820 --> 02:25:28,820
Don't you guys care about Captain Jack?

1850
02:25:28,820 --> 02:25:32,820
Didn't he die for your sins?

1851
02:25:32,820 --> 02:25:34,820
Maybe.

1852
02:25:34,820 --> 02:25:37,820
Isn't he going to be coming back soon?

1853
02:25:37,820 --> 02:25:39,820
I mean, come on. Come on, people.

1854
02:25:39,820 --> 02:25:42,820
All right. Get off the show. No, I'm kidding.

1855
02:25:42,820 --> 02:25:44,820
Stop gaying up the show, Extover.

1856
02:25:44,820 --> 02:25:47,820
Well, I'm sorry, Rob. Okay?

1857
02:25:47,820 --> 02:25:50,820
But I thought he was fabulous.

1858
02:25:50,820 --> 02:25:53,820
Here, Loki. Here's your mic.

1859
02:25:53,820 --> 02:25:55,820
I'm just kidding. You don't have to leave.

1860
02:25:55,820 --> 02:25:56,820
Okay.

1861
02:25:56,820 --> 02:25:57,820
That was great.

1862
02:25:57,820 --> 02:25:58,820
Anyway.

1863
02:25:58,820 --> 02:25:59,820
So, there it is.

1864
02:25:59,820 --> 02:26:00,820
The show needs more gay.

1865
02:26:00,820 --> 02:26:01,820
Three new songs.

1866
02:26:01,820 --> 02:26:08,900
New, new, newbie, new, newbie and songs next week.

1867
02:26:08,900 --> 02:26:10,060
I already know what song I'm putting in.

1868
02:26:10,060 --> 02:26:13,820
I'm not allowing Mikul Tov to pick my song next week.

1869
02:26:13,820 --> 02:26:16,940
Actually, is he on?

1870
02:26:16,940 --> 02:26:21,580
I'm going to see if he's on AIM right now because I might send him a message letting

1871
02:26:21,580 --> 02:26:22,580
him know.

1872
02:26:22,580 --> 02:26:27,040
if he is online he's too good to be listening to this program but I want to

1873
02:26:27,040 --> 02:26:34,240
let him know that he won oh he's not online right now denied or he blocked me

1874
02:26:34,240 --> 02:26:38,640
now one or the other all right so anyway moving on then I think now would be an

1875
02:26:38,640 --> 02:26:43,640
appropriate time to do our FUs of the week what do you guys think it is it time

1876
02:26:43,640 --> 02:26:48,440
to get a little bit angsty is it getting angsty in here is it just me all right

1877
02:26:48,440 --> 02:26:54,440
Let's get into the FUs of the Week, and DarkSakura has a new theme song for the FUs of the Week this week.

1878
02:26:54,440 --> 02:26:56,440
Who said you could change your song?

1879
02:26:56,440 --> 02:26:57,440
I did!

1880
02:26:57,440 --> 02:26:58,440
Alright.

1881
02:26:58,440 --> 02:26:59,440
Meow.

1882
02:26:59,440 --> 02:27:00,440
Meow.

1883
02:27:00,440 --> 02:27:01,440
Alright.

1884
02:27:01,440 --> 02:27:04,440
DarkSakura, why is it that we do the FUs of the Week every single week?

1885
02:27:04,440 --> 02:27:06,440
Grr, argh.

1886
02:27:09,440 --> 02:27:12,440
Oh, I like this. This is video game sounding.

1887
02:27:14,440 --> 02:27:16,440
Burn, fire, kill, die, burn!

1888
02:27:16,440 --> 02:27:20,440
Dude, it's Schwartzstein. They're pretty cool. I might change it, though.

1889
02:27:20,440 --> 02:27:24,440
But, um, my first F.U. goes to the cage match.

1890
02:27:24,440 --> 02:27:28,440
Um, my second F.U. goes toward, uh, Captain Jack.

1891
02:27:28,440 --> 02:27:32,440
For dying. How dare he.

1892
02:27:38,440 --> 02:27:42,440
Um, no, this isn't schlag work. It's Schwartzstein.

1893
02:27:42,440 --> 02:27:55,440
Another F.U. goes to being tired and another F.U. goes towards basically being slaked on by people.

1894
02:27:56,440 --> 02:27:59,440
As I look across the window.

1895
02:28:00,440 --> 02:28:03,440
I was like going, you know, I'm sorry, I forgot to call you.

1896
02:28:04,440 --> 02:28:06,440
Because I went to my lobster.

1897
02:28:06,440 --> 02:28:18,640
F.U. to Red Lobster for your tasty food that made me stay in the bathroom for an hour.

1898
02:28:18,640 --> 02:28:26,440
And the F.U. to homework, F.U. to having the work to live, that's all, the end.

1899
02:28:26,440 --> 02:28:32,640
Alright, then let's get to Loki's F.Us.

1900
02:28:32,640 --> 02:28:37,120
My first nephew goes to the goddamn slow people that have to be in front of me every time

1901
02:28:37,120 --> 02:28:39,160
I go out driving.

1902
02:28:39,160 --> 02:28:43,160
You know, it's just really retarded people out there that just don't pay attention.

1903
02:28:43,160 --> 02:28:45,680
It's always women on their goddamn cell phones.

1904
02:28:45,680 --> 02:28:50,960
I'm sorry, I have given you plenty of chances to redeem yourself, but everywhere I look,

1905
02:28:50,960 --> 02:28:56,400
there's a goddamn woman on her cell phone driving a stupid SUV, nearly hitting something.

1906
02:28:56,400 --> 02:28:57,400
All the time.

1907
02:28:57,400 --> 02:29:01,920
I mean, literally you cannot go outside without seeing something like that.

1908
02:29:01,920 --> 02:29:08,920
Well, you know what SUV stands for? The stupid, useless vehicle for stupid, useless people.

1909
02:29:31,920 --> 02:29:34,640
in general just um...

1910
02:29:34,640 --> 02:29:38,160
fucked PHP because it was way too damn hard the programming

1911
02:29:38,160 --> 02:29:42,120
and i'm glad i'm done doing that unfortunately you know i'll have to

1912
02:29:42,120 --> 02:29:45,200
come up with something new and

1913
02:29:45,200 --> 02:29:46,240
yeah my job's never done

1914
02:29:46,240 --> 02:29:49,360
and also fuck those stupid people on

1915
02:29:49,360 --> 02:29:53,640
craigslist that want to charge a hundred thirty five dollars for a webpage design

1916
02:29:53,640 --> 02:29:54,560
and

1917
02:29:54,560 --> 02:29:58,040
granted a hundred thirty five dollars for a webpage isn't probably too bad

1918
02:29:58,040 --> 02:29:59,440
if the webpage is good

1919
02:29:59,440 --> 02:30:02,560
you don't look at their examples in the webpage looks like something that even

1920
02:30:02,560 --> 02:30:04,400
myspace would reject

1921
02:30:04,400 --> 02:30:09,120
so i mean wow who the fuck would pay for that stuff and and obviously there has

1922
02:30:09,120 --> 02:30:12,900
been people have paid for that because we see examples on their website

1923
02:30:12,900 --> 02:30:17,000
i say fuck them because you know i could do a way better job so i guess i don't

1924
02:30:17,000 --> 02:30:20,540
know maybe i should

1925
02:30:20,540 --> 02:30:23,700
i'm gonna do a new f u song as well tonight i think

1926
02:30:23,700 --> 02:30:30,700
just like

1927
02:30:31,900 --> 02:30:33,780
uh...

1928
02:30:33,780 --> 02:30:36,900
i'd like to give it up to you uh... don't

1929
02:30:36,900 --> 02:30:38,620
cuba like that

1930
02:30:38,620 --> 02:30:42,940
uh... i'd like to get a few to our uh... apartment complex

1931
02:30:42,940 --> 02:30:46,180
because our apartment complex but can i call them on monday to tell them that

1932
02:30:46,180 --> 02:30:50,620
the washer in the apartment was broken and it took them till today to just

1933
02:30:50,620 --> 02:30:53,200
bring them a new washer you know why it finally happened today

1934
02:30:53,200 --> 02:30:58,100
Because when I called the office, I actually got to speak to the general manager, and it's the only reason it got taken care of today.

1935
02:30:58,100 --> 02:31:00,100
She had my problem fixed in five minutes.

1936
02:31:00,700 --> 02:31:02,900
Seriously, it was just, it was a nightmare.

1937
02:31:02,900 --> 02:31:08,900
And you know, not having a washer is just plain fucking insane.

1938
02:31:09,400 --> 02:31:13,400
You have to like rely on your friends to have time to let you use their washer.

1939
02:31:13,700 --> 02:31:14,100
Yeah.

1940
02:31:14,100 --> 02:31:20,800
You know, because I'm not going to go to no laundromat or whatever to spend money and try to wash and dry my clothes.

1941
02:31:20,800 --> 02:31:25,800
kostjamrh I have another one Rob

1942
02:31:50,800 --> 02:31:53,980
some of our guest FUs started off with DDR Angel.

1943
02:31:53,980 --> 02:31:59,200
Well, I usually don't bitch about a game per se or what happened in the game,

1944
02:31:59,200 --> 02:32:02,580
but this one redeems itself, you see, because

1945
02:32:02,580 --> 02:32:04,860
usually you go into a group and

1946
02:32:04,860 --> 02:32:07,860
hopefully good things happen and you level and all the while whatever.

1947
02:32:07,860 --> 02:32:09,940
This guy was a complete butt-head though,

1948
02:32:09,940 --> 02:32:13,580
because as soon as I rolled on the object that I needed, he was like,

1949
02:32:13,580 --> 02:32:17,380
you don't need that, you're a piece, this, this, this, this. So, you know what, fuck you.

1950
02:32:17,380 --> 02:32:19,140
and um...

1951
02:32:19,140 --> 02:32:21,860
a fuck you to kicking me out of the group

1952
02:32:21,860 --> 02:32:24,420
after you didn't get your way. I mean it was just...

1953
02:32:24,420 --> 02:32:26,920
it was just massive monster player kill.

1954
02:32:26,920 --> 02:32:31,040
Go in the middle of the mob, run out and kill the priest!

1955
02:32:31,040 --> 02:32:35,620
Fuck you. And that's pretty much it.

1956
02:32:35,620 --> 02:32:43,140
So, yeah, that guy needs to be blacklisted and never spoken to again, which I already did, so ha ha ha ha ha.

1957
02:32:43,140 --> 02:32:45,040
And your entire kill too.

1958
02:32:45,040 --> 02:32:47,040
Next to her, your FUs of the week.

1959
02:32:50,040 --> 02:32:56,040
FU to working for a living. I second Dark Soccer's FU.

1960
02:32:56,040 --> 02:33:01,040
I went and applied for another job today, so maybe I'll have two.

1961
02:33:02,040 --> 02:33:07,040
And, you know, I don't know. Like, I'm just not looking forward to working two jobs.

1962
02:33:07,040 --> 02:33:10,040
Especially the job that I applied for is retail.

1963
02:33:10,040 --> 02:33:12,040
And I'm the retail king.

1964
02:33:12,040 --> 02:33:16,040
But if you're going to work at my favorite store and you can get me discounts, I'm so excited.

1965
02:33:16,040 --> 02:33:19,040
That's fucking great for you.

1966
02:33:19,040 --> 02:33:23,040
I, on the other hand, am not really happy for it.

1967
02:33:23,040 --> 02:33:27,040
But, you know, I mean, it's cool. I mean, I just need the extra money.

1968
02:33:27,040 --> 02:33:30,040
So, I mean, in the long run it will be good for me.

1969
02:33:30,040 --> 02:33:34,040
But at the same time, fuck you to working for a living.

1970
02:33:34,040 --> 02:33:38,040
I forgot something. Ow, I just hurt myself.

1971
02:33:38,040 --> 02:33:42,500
you to not having enough time to do artwork and play video games. That's just that.

1972
02:33:42,500 --> 02:33:46,920
Manwhore's getting too expensive, Christopher.

1973
02:33:46,920 --> 02:33:49,000
They are. I mean, you know,

1974
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:51,080
and I pay the extra

1975
02:33:51,080 --> 02:33:54,860
so that I can, you know, suck their assholes.

1976
02:33:54,860 --> 02:34:01,280
Oh my god! And, you know, that's like a hundred and twenty bucks extra.

1977
02:34:01,280 --> 02:34:03,080
You're cut off. Shut up.

1978
02:34:03,080 --> 02:34:06,160
I'm sorry, but, you know, but

1979
02:34:06,160 --> 02:34:11,160
You know, I think that it's a really horrible thing when you have to charge extra for that.

1980
02:34:11,160 --> 02:34:12,160
Anyway.

1981
02:34:12,160 --> 02:34:13,160
Can you please go to the chat room?

1982
02:34:13,160 --> 02:34:15,160
It's all just jokes, people.

1983
02:34:15,160 --> 02:34:17,160
It's okay to have sexual humor.

1984
02:34:17,160 --> 02:34:19,160
I saw some people in the chat room earlier.

1985
02:34:19,160 --> 02:34:23,160
It's okay, just get over it.

1986
02:34:23,160 --> 02:34:26,160
I'm not going to change, so, you know, leave if you don't like it.

1987
02:34:26,160 --> 02:34:32,160
The views and opinions expressed by Exifer are not necessarily that of the show.

1988
02:34:32,160 --> 02:34:35,160
Misty says, Fuck my schedule for work this week.

1989
02:34:35,160 --> 02:34:38,360
Of all the weeks that I could go in later because my mom is on vacation this week, I

1990
02:34:38,360 --> 02:34:43,360
get scheduled for 8am or earlier.

1991
02:34:43,360 --> 02:34:46,760
John Field says, F you to my car which has it's speedometer messed up.

1992
02:34:46,760 --> 02:34:49,160
It says 55 and police gun says 45.

1993
02:34:49,160 --> 02:34:51,600
Does anyone know where to take this thing to get it fixed?

1994
02:34:51,600 --> 02:34:54,640
I've gone to the local Acura repair shop and they can't fix it.

1995
02:34:54,640 --> 02:34:59,760
For fuck them, so fuck them for not being able to fix their own cars.

1996
02:34:59,760 --> 02:35:06,640
Goggle says, oh, is sending me a private link, thank you Goggle.

2003
02:35:28,400 --> 02:35:30,560
people can have mental issues at times

2004
02:35:30,560 --> 02:35:33,320
instead of just being lazy for now

2005
02:35:33,320 --> 02:35:36,960
F you to etel for having a crappy DSL connection when I was trying to make my

2006
02:35:36,960 --> 02:35:40,460

2007

F you to that mark guy of epic games for just being a game facts NGG fanboy noob

Soccerina says F you to MPQ for teasing me all night long.

2017
02:36:13,480 --> 02:36:14,480

2018
02:36:14,480 --> 02:36:15,480
Just kidding.

Neo14789 says FU to AP chemistry and loads of homework.

And fuck you to light rail.

Color of Sakura says FU to having a 10 page research paper that I haven't started it's

2031
02:36:55,280 --> 02:36:57,280
I might want to get started on that, buddy.

2032
02:36:57,280 --> 02:36:59,280
F you to Sky for not being gay enough.

2033

2038
02:37:19,280 --> 02:37:24,280

2039
02:37:24,280 --> 02:37:31,280
Rene says F you to those cat food packets because the cat food liquid stuff inside goes everywhere

2040
02:37:31,280 --> 02:37:34,280
when you open the damn thing

2041
02:37:34,280 --> 02:37:40,280

F you to having to reconnect to the stream with iTunes since the quality goes down as a result

2043
02:37:44,280 --> 02:37:45,280
I got an I.M. F.U.

2044
02:37:45,280 --> 02:37:46,280
Okay, what's that?

2045
02:37:46,280 --> 02:37:47,280
I'm a Vexer.

2046
02:37:47,280 --> 02:37:48,280
Uh-huh.

2047
02:37:48,280 --> 02:37:54,280
Uh, F.U. to November 22nd, we're having three shitty albums come out on the same day.

2048
02:37:54,280 --> 02:37:58,280
Lindsay Lohan, Jessica Simpson, and Scott Strap of Creed.

2049
02:37:58,280 --> 02:38:00,280
Lindsay Lohan has another album coming out?

2050
02:38:00,280 --> 02:38:01,280
Yeah.

2051
02:38:01,280 --> 02:38:03,280
Who told her she could put out one, let alone two?

2052
02:38:03,280 --> 02:38:04,280
I don't know.

2053
02:38:04,280 --> 02:38:05,280
Bitch.

2054
02:38:05,280 --> 02:38:08,280
Did you hear that she's gonna be making indie films now to get some street cred?

2055
02:38:08,280 --> 02:38:10,280
She's signed up with some indie films.

2056
02:38:10,280 --> 02:38:11,280
Hopefully those indie films-

2057
02:38:11,280 --> 02:38:12,280
Maybe she'll die.

2058
02:38:12,280 --> 02:38:15,680
Hopefully those indie films that are porn will involve lots of nudity.

2059
02:38:15,680 --> 02:38:16,680
Is that what you want?

2060
02:38:16,680 --> 02:38:19,840
I think she should do a remake of the Captain Jack song we heard tonight.

2061
02:38:19,840 --> 02:38:20,840
You think so?

2062
02:38:20,840 --> 02:38:21,840
Yeah, I do.

2063
02:38:21,840 --> 02:38:22,840
It'll be good times.

2064
02:38:22,840 --> 02:38:23,840
All right.

2065
02:38:23,840 --> 02:38:24,840
We're going to...

2066
02:38:24,840 --> 02:38:27,960
Actually, we're going to go to one more break, but there's a purpose behind this break, because

2067
02:38:27,960 --> 02:38:32,840
I wanted to play this for you guys tonight at some point, because I just got this from

2068
02:38:32,840 --> 02:38:36,580
our buddy Miklotov, and he says it's very cool, and I want to play it for you guys.

2069
02:38:36,580 --> 02:38:38,120
It's in the Kiriyamaoka track.

2070
02:38:38,120 --> 02:38:42,320
It's actually System Romance, but it's not the song that we know it from 2DX.

2071
02:38:42,320 --> 02:38:45,040
It's actually a guitar instrumental version.

2072
02:38:45,040 --> 02:38:49,800
It's actually the demo version of System Romance by Kiryamoka, and I think it's available on

2073
02:38:49,800 --> 02:38:53,280
his website in streaming form or something, but we're going to play it for you guys, because

2074
02:38:53,280 --> 02:38:57,760
it rocks and it's a Kiryamoka, so this is going to be our last break for tonight, and

2075
02:38:57,760 --> 02:38:59,280
then when we come back we'll do...

2076
02:38:59,280 --> 02:39:00,280
More news!

2077
02:39:00,280 --> 02:39:01,280
More news.

2078
02:39:01,280 --> 02:39:02,280
Yes.

2079
02:39:02,280 --> 02:39:03,280
Okay.

2080
02:39:03,280 --> 02:39:04,280
More news than it is.

2081
02:39:04,280 --> 02:39:05,960
And maybe some Ask Orange Lounge if we have time?

2082
02:39:05,960 --> 02:39:06,960
Sure.

2083
02:39:06,960 --> 02:39:07,960
If we have time, but we don't know tonight.

2084
02:39:07,960 --> 02:39:12,780
we may not get to do it. So, anyway, here we go, a Kiryamoka with a guitar version of

2085
02:39:12,780 --> 02:39:15,780
system romance. Enjoy!

2086
02:40:12,780 --> 02:40:19,780
I'm in love with you

2087
02:40:19,780 --> 02:40:26,780
I'm in love with you

2088
02:40:26,780 --> 02:40:33,780
I'm in love with you

2089
02:42:03,780 --> 02:42:04,780
I don't know, I don't know

2090
02:42:04,780 --> 02:42:05,780
I don't know

2091
02:42:05,780 --> 02:42:06,780
I don't know

2092
02:44:06,780 --> 02:44:15,220
Q&A with a instrumental version of System Romance.

2093
02:44:15,220 --> 02:44:19,640
I promised somebody that we could do one more call over the Skypline, so we're going to

2094
02:44:19,640 --> 02:44:22,700
go ahead and go to the Skypline for one last call before we get to some more news.

2095
02:44:22,700 --> 02:44:23,700
Hi, you're on Orange Laundry Radio.

2096
02:44:23,700 --> 02:44:24,700
Hey, Sky, it's John Field.

2097
02:44:24,700 --> 02:44:25,700
Hey, John, what's on your mind?

2098
02:44:25,700 --> 02:44:26,700
I'm doing okay.

2099
02:44:26,700 --> 02:44:27,700
What's on your mind tonight?

2100
02:44:27,700 --> 02:44:34,700
Well, I've got a pretty big announcement to make.

2101
02:44:34,700 --> 02:44:35,700
Okay.

2102
02:44:35,700 --> 02:44:49,700
A couple months back, I made an announcement on Orange Lounge Radio, the official announcement about it, that I would be starting up a Phantasy Star Online Mishima, and I've got good news about that.

2103
02:44:49,700 --> 02:44:55,700
The first episode will be released tomorrow, and I'll be posting a link to it in the chat room.

2104
02:44:55,700 --> 02:45:00,700
Oh, very cool. Now, explain for those that might not know, what is a Mishima?

2105
02:45:00,700 --> 02:45:13,700
A machima is basically the idea of taking a video game, using the characters in it, and using that to tell a story that's different from what the actual game is like. Sort of like what Red vs. Blue did for Halo.

2106
02:45:13,700 --> 02:45:18,700
Right, and I remember I saw a commercial on TV the other day that was The Sims 2, and it was a very similar kind of thing.

2107
02:45:18,700 --> 02:45:24,700
So a lot of folks like that Red vs. Blue stuff, so now you made one for Phantasy Star Online.

2108
02:45:24,700 --> 02:45:25,700
Yeah.

2109
02:45:25,700 --> 02:45:26,700
Very cool, what's it called?

2110
02:45:26,700 --> 02:45:32,700
It's called The Monster Within, and the first episode, like I said, will be out tomorrow.

2111
02:45:32,700 --> 02:45:36,700
If it's not up on archive.org, I'll be hosting it on my own web space.

2112
02:45:36,700 --> 02:45:43,700
And hopefully this will be, maybe every few weeks or so, I'll have another release out.

2113
02:45:43,700 --> 02:45:46,700
Give us a little hint as to the plot of the first episode.

2114
02:45:46,700 --> 02:45:51,700
The plot of the first episode is sort of, it takes place before the actual game starts.

2115
02:45:51,700 --> 02:45:56,700
It's sort of like, you're there seeing the explosion of my goal.

2116
02:45:56,700 --> 02:45:57,700
Hmm.

2117
02:45:57,700 --> 02:46:00,700
Okay, so a little bit of a prequel going on here.

2118
02:46:00,700 --> 02:46:03,700
You going to send this to some folks at SEGA, see what they think of it?

2119
02:46:03,700 --> 02:46:07,700
Actually, I'm already working with a contact inside SEGA.

2120
02:46:07,700 --> 02:46:10,700
It's the GM for Blue Burst, Clumsy Orchid.

2121
02:46:10,700 --> 02:46:11,700
Awesome.

2122
02:46:11,700 --> 02:46:12,700
Well, good luck with that.

2123
02:46:12,700 --> 02:46:13,700
I hope you have a good time.

2124
02:46:13,700 --> 02:46:15,700
And hey, name drop Oren's mom's name somewhere, okay?

2125
02:46:15,700 --> 02:46:16,700
Okay.

2126
02:46:16,700 --> 02:46:17,700
Just messing with you.

2127
02:46:17,700 --> 02:46:18,700
All right, have a good one.

2128
02:46:18,700 --> 02:46:19,700
Thanks for, and good luck with that.

2129
02:46:19,700 --> 02:46:20,700
Let us know how it does.

2130
02:46:20,700 --> 02:46:27,700
the link in the chatroom so we can check it out.

2131
02:46:50,700 --> 02:46:53,500
So we got a lot in here in the last 15 minutes.

2132
02:46:53,500 --> 02:46:54,020
OK.

2133
02:46:54,020 --> 02:46:57,540
Anyways, stuff I was going to be talking about.

2134
02:46:57,540 --> 02:47:00,060
And we posted this to the site earlier this week about this

2135
02:47:00,060 --> 02:47:03,360
new dance game that's coming out by the creators of Get on

2136
02:47:03,360 --> 02:47:03,820
the Mic.

2137
02:47:03,820 --> 02:47:05,860
And it actually used to be called Get on the Floor.

2138
02:47:05,860 --> 02:47:11,140
But now it's Flow, the Urban Dance Uprising.

2139
02:47:11,140 --> 02:47:14,740
This game is the Urban Dance Uprising.

2140
02:47:14,740 --> 02:47:16,300
Yes, Dance Uprising.

2141
02:47:16,300 --> 02:47:20,180
Because Uprising's like a revolution, I guess.

2142
02:47:20,180 --> 02:47:33,180
But it's basically DDR, I mean, in every sense of it. It is so much like DDR that I'm sure we'll see the lawsuit in a few months here, but, um, what can I say? It's all Breakbeat music, which is kinda cool.

2143
02:47:33,180 --> 02:47:44,180
Um, you've got some pretty good tracks, and a lot of them I didn't recognize, cause, I mean, I like Breakbeat and stuff, but I don't really, um, listen to a whole lot of it, so...

2144
02:47:44,180 --> 02:47:48,680
But it's going to be coming out actually the week after

2145
02:47:48,680 --> 02:47:50,220
Ultramix 3

2146
02:47:50,220 --> 02:47:55,980
for, I believe it's only on the Xbox, if I remember correctly.

2147
02:47:55,980 --> 02:48:01,220
But two of the main songs that I wanted to mention was The Breaks by Curtis Blow

2148
02:48:01,220 --> 02:48:05,040
and Eighth Wonder by Sugarhill Gang, which are going to be

2149
02:48:05,040 --> 02:48:06,320
two of the big songs in it.

2150
02:48:06,320 --> 02:48:07,980
Interesting. But it's

2151
02:48:07,980 --> 02:48:09,140
basically BDR.

2152
02:48:09,140 --> 02:48:12,060
Very, very similar.

2153
02:48:12,060 --> 02:48:19,060
So that was the one I wanted to mention, I think that was the only story I had if I remember

2154
02:48:19,060 --> 02:48:20,060
correctly.

2155
02:48:20,060 --> 02:48:21,060
Yeah.

2156
02:48:21,060 --> 02:48:22,060
Okay.

2157
02:48:22,060 --> 02:48:23,060
Just that dance game.

2158
02:48:23,060 --> 02:48:24,540
It'll be interesting to check out.

2159
02:48:24,540 --> 02:48:27,740
I got a couple other things I want to add which I think is very interesting.

2160
02:48:27,740 --> 02:48:33,820
DDR Freak is reporting this week that Carl's Jr., as we know it here on the west coast

2161
02:48:33,820 --> 02:48:36,220
but on the east coast they call it Hardee's, but same thing.

2162
02:48:36,220 --> 02:48:41,080
They're actually going to be running a promotion this November where DDR is going to be advertised

2163
02:48:41,080 --> 02:48:45,160
on their drink cups. But that's very interesting, on their 44 ounce, like their super drink

2164
02:48:45,160 --> 02:48:48,760
cups, they're gonna advertise like DDR games. Which I think is very interesting because

2165
02:48:48,760 --> 02:48:52,320
you consider the types of things that are usually advertised on the side of fast food

2166
02:48:52,320 --> 02:48:56,440
drink cups, and it's like, well, Extrovert, you drink a lot of fast food cups, so what

2167
02:48:56,440 --> 02:48:59,760
kind of... I'm just kidding. I just saw you grab the mic.

2168
02:48:59,760 --> 02:49:01,280
You said Carl's Jr., right? Yes.

2169
02:49:01,280 --> 02:49:04,960
Oh, I love Carl's Jr. Okay, or Hardee's, if you're on the East Coast.

2170
02:49:04,960 --> 02:49:12,240
Hardys. Carl's Jr. is the best. That's pretty good. And I think that makes it even better.

2171
02:49:12,240 --> 02:49:16,760
You know, I once dated somebody who refused to eat at Carl's Jr. because Carl's Jr. was

2172
02:49:16,760 --> 02:49:20,920
giving secret money to anti-gay Republican organizations, supposedly?

2173
02:49:20,920 --> 02:49:25,560
Call me Republican and anti-gay, because I love Carl's Jr.

2174
02:49:25,560 --> 02:49:30,840
Those Western bacons will make me... They are the Western bacon cheeseburger.

2175
02:49:30,840 --> 02:49:35,740
Anyway, so usually they advertise Disney movies on the side of drink cups and whatever else

2176
02:49:35,740 --> 02:49:39,980
is going on, but DDR is going to be a promotion at Carl's Jr. Hardy.

2177
02:49:39,980 --> 02:49:40,980
That's very interesting.

2178
02:49:40,980 --> 02:49:41,980
It is.

2179
02:49:41,980 --> 02:49:42,980
That's interesting.

2180
02:49:42,980 --> 02:49:47,060
Also, here's the thing, inside the store, there's going to be a big advertising standee

2181
02:49:47,060 --> 02:49:51,940
and there'll be $5 coupons attached to the standee, so you can use these $5 coupons for

2182
02:49:51,940 --> 02:49:56,100
Extreme II, UltraMix III, or Karaoke Revolution game.

2183
02:49:56,100 --> 02:49:57,100
Nice.

2184
02:49:57,100 --> 02:49:58,100
Should be interesting.

2185
02:49:58,100 --> 02:49:59,100
Yeah.

2186
02:49:59,100 --> 02:50:00,100
That's going to be kind of cool.

2187
02:50:00,100 --> 02:50:01,100
What?

2188
02:50:01,100 --> 02:50:02,100
That's right.

2189
02:50:02,100 --> 02:50:03,100
Kiriyamaoka Revolution Party's coming up soon.

2190
02:50:03,100 --> 02:50:04,100
That's right.

2191
02:50:04,100 --> 02:50:06,100
I can't wait until we get them here on the show.

2192
02:50:06,100 --> 02:50:07,100
Oh no.

2193
02:50:07,100 --> 02:50:08,100
No.

2194
02:50:08,100 --> 02:50:09,100
No, no, no, no.

2195
02:50:09,100 --> 02:50:11,540
We need a Kiriyamaoka Revolution.

2196
02:50:11,540 --> 02:50:15,500
I keep forgetting that we have international listeners, so they're like, I don't know if

2197
02:50:15,500 --> 02:50:18,740
it's Canada or what, but somebody's all, we don't have arties here, wah!

2198
02:50:18,740 --> 02:50:21,180
You're not missing anything, trust me.

2199
02:50:21,180 --> 02:50:22,180
Their burgers taste like ass.

2200
02:50:22,180 --> 02:50:25,100
Party sells fried chicken.

2201
02:50:25,100 --> 02:50:28,780
And they have like, you know, giant sized burgers that taste like ass.

2202
02:50:28,780 --> 02:50:33,180
me I used to like you know some of their burgers there but there's this one

2203
02:50:33,180 --> 02:50:38,980
Carl's Jr. that was right by our house and it was really really bad there I

2204
02:50:38,980 --> 02:50:43,740
remember the the probably the pinnacle of their suckiness was when the salt

2205
02:50:43,740 --> 02:50:57,460
tasted like urine for some reason. Angel you'd know about that right? Wow. No. No.

2206
02:50:57,460 --> 02:51:02,460
Hardee's is cooler than Carl's Jr. though because they have fried chicken and biscuits.

2207
02:51:02,460 --> 02:51:07,460
I think that they're fine. And if they taste like ass, call me an ass man.

2208
02:51:07,460 --> 02:51:10,460
Because I really like Carl's Jr.

2209
02:51:10,460 --> 02:51:15,460
But, Carl's Jr. has in selected restaurants the green burrito.

2210
02:51:15,460 --> 02:51:18,460
You know, I don't like green burrito. But you know what, I like...

2211
02:51:18,460 --> 02:51:21,460
Shut your mouths, women!

2212
02:51:21,460 --> 02:51:25,460
My fast food of choice better than Carl's Jr. though is Jack in the Box,

2213
02:51:25,460 --> 02:51:28,940
Which I know is also not available in all the states, but it's the best place.

2214
02:51:28,940 --> 02:51:29,940
Yack in the crack.

2215
02:51:29,940 --> 02:51:30,940
Oh, that's great.

2216
02:51:30,940 --> 02:51:35,580
I found out something like a couple weeks ago.

2217
02:51:35,580 --> 02:51:36,580
What?

2218
02:51:36,580 --> 02:51:38,260
About fast food, and...

2219
02:51:38,260 --> 02:51:39,260
It makes you fat?

2220
02:51:39,260 --> 02:51:40,260
I mean, I do that, or what?

2221
02:51:40,260 --> 02:51:41,260
No, no, no, no.

2222
02:51:41,260 --> 02:51:43,260
We have a Chick-fil-A now.

2223
02:51:43,260 --> 02:51:45,260
Oh, come on, fuck-

2224
02:51:45,260 --> 02:51:46,260
Okay, big whoop!

2225
02:51:46,260 --> 02:51:47,260
Honestly-

2226
02:51:47,260 --> 02:51:48,260
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

2227
02:51:48,260 --> 02:51:49,260
I freaking grew up with a Chick-fil-A.

2228
02:51:49,260 --> 02:51:50,260
I know, but I didn't.

2229
02:51:50,260 --> 02:51:51,260
I'm sorry.

2230
02:51:51,260 --> 02:51:52,260
I had an identity, but I didn't.

2231
02:51:52,260 --> 02:51:53,260
What?

2232
02:51:53,260 --> 02:51:55,260
Fuck Chick-fil-A. What's the big deal about Chick-fil-A?

2233
02:51:55,260 --> 02:51:58,260
The crack they put in the Polynesian sauce.

2234
02:51:58,260 --> 02:51:59,260
I like it.

2235
02:51:59,260 --> 02:52:01,260
All Chick-fil-A's are closed on Sunday.

2236
02:52:01,260 --> 02:52:04,260
I know, because they're praising Jesus.

2237
02:52:04,260 --> 02:52:08,260
But no, I think that it's very admirable that they would take a corporate stance for their beliefs.

2238
02:52:08,260 --> 02:52:11,260
I agree, and it's good that the employees at least all get one good day off.

2239
02:52:11,260 --> 02:52:12,260
I hate sores to do that.

2240
02:52:12,260 --> 02:52:17,260
I freaking hate it. Okay, goddamn tugboat, you know, fish and chips, and Nippon.

2241
02:52:17,260 --> 02:52:24,260
Both of the places I love their food, the only time I really have a chance to get some is on Sundays and they have to go freaking warship.

2242
02:52:24,260 --> 02:52:29,260
They can do that in the morning like normal people and they come back to work.

2243
02:52:29,260 --> 02:52:33,780
Some people actually live up to their personal beliefs, maybe?

2244
02:52:33,780 --> 02:52:36,780
No one does that anymore.

2245
02:52:36,780 --> 02:52:39,460
That's so passe.

2246
02:52:39,460 --> 02:52:43,220
I have to commend anyone who's willing to take a stance like that for what they believe

2247
02:52:43,220 --> 02:52:44,220
in.

2248
02:52:44,220 --> 02:52:45,860
I think that it's very admirable.

2249
02:52:45,860 --> 02:52:53,740
The church crowd, when I used to work at Walmart, when they used to come in, I have horrible

2250
02:52:53,740 --> 02:52:59,220
stories there's a worst crowd in the world I swear you're praising Jesus and

2251
02:52:59,220 --> 02:53:04,700
you want you know to be saved yet you want to save more money than you want to

2252
02:53:04,700 --> 02:53:10,380
be saved okay that's all I have you know just let's not let's not start a holy

2253
02:53:10,380 --> 02:53:15,620
war oh I know I don't I grew up in a Christian family I know all about it so

2254
02:53:15,620 --> 02:53:22,340
damn an angel started I'm sorry no because I wanted to play remember being

2255
02:53:22,340 --> 02:53:27,660
religious does not make one moral that's true that is true I just said it cuz I

2256
02:53:27,660 --> 02:53:33,140
thought you guys missed it or something never mind my aims improving um if I'm

2257
02:53:33,140 --> 02:53:36,260
gonna have fast food it's all about Panda Express and I consider Panda

2258
02:53:36,260 --> 02:53:41,260
Express fast food if I'm gonna have fast food then I'll have cooked it the night

2259
02:53:41,260 --> 02:53:44,500
before and take it out of the refrigerator funny you said that Rob

2260
02:53:44,500 --> 02:53:49,780
about Panda Express why all of a sudden I'm thinking of that little cartoon

2261
02:53:49,780 --> 02:53:54,340
thing they have on the World of Warcraft site that says Pandora and Express, and I'm going,

2262
02:53:54,340 --> 02:53:55,340
no!

2263
02:53:55,340 --> 02:53:58,300
Okay, my brain is tainted for the evening, thank you.

2264
02:53:58,300 --> 02:54:02,820
Seriously though, if people who are going to go somewhere the next day, they know that

2265
02:54:02,820 --> 02:54:06,780
they're going to stop to get fast food, isn't it just easier to pack a lunch?

2266
02:54:06,780 --> 02:54:10,340
It's cheaper and better for you.

2267
02:54:10,340 --> 02:54:13,460
I think that everybody should boycott fast food for a week.

2268
02:54:13,460 --> 02:54:14,460
Good.

2269
02:54:14,460 --> 02:54:15,460
I don't want to...

2270
02:54:15,460 --> 02:54:16,460
Get out of my drive-thru.

2271
02:54:16,460 --> 02:54:17,460
No, seriously.

2272
02:54:17,460 --> 02:54:23,940
No seriously, I think that if everybody stopped eating fast food for the duration of one entire

2273
02:54:23,940 --> 02:54:29,100
week, ate regular food, out of the refrigerator, that you go to the grocery store and you have

2274
02:54:29,100 --> 02:54:35,100
to prepare, after a week, I swear, your general level of health and well-being is going to

2275
02:54:35,100 --> 02:54:36,100
be vastly improved.

2276
02:54:36,100 --> 02:54:39,540
I would make a financial wager that I could go, I would make a substantial financial wager

2277
02:54:39,540 --> 02:54:42,300
that I could go longer without fast food than these two.

2278
02:54:42,300 --> 02:54:44,300
Oh, I believe it.

2279
02:54:44,300 --> 02:54:46,700
They wouldn't last five seconds.

2280
02:54:46,700 --> 02:54:52,420
Oh, yeah, right five seconds. Whoo. Okay. I'm going outside

2281
02:54:53,360 --> 02:54:55,360
Is this a bet?

2282
02:54:55,740 --> 02:55:02,260
Yeah, official orange sounds radio bet. Okay, I bet I can go. I am the master of my domain

2283
02:55:02,260 --> 02:55:08,140
I bet I can go six fucking months without eating fast food. I will put money in it

2284
02:55:08,660 --> 02:55:10,660
if you

2285
02:55:11,780 --> 02:55:15,920
Don't believe it. I don't believe that Christopher would be able to okay. We'll do this right now

2286
02:55:15,920 --> 02:55:24,880
now if he breaks his fast food goal then for every month remaining on the six

2287
02:55:24,880 --> 02:55:30,040
months he has to pay $10 so for example if he makes it four months and then eats

2288
02:55:30,040 --> 02:55:37,160
fast food he has to pay 20 bucks to what to us for the station you have to pay

2289
02:55:37,160 --> 02:55:42,760
our station bill you're on I don't need that and shit

2290
02:55:42,760 --> 02:55:44,760
Wait a minute.

2291
02:55:44,760 --> 02:55:48,760
Christopher just agreed to something that Loki and I didn't even say we'd participate in,

2292
02:55:48,760 --> 02:55:51,760
so now it's all Christopher and how long he can go without fast food.

2293
02:55:51,760 --> 02:55:53,760
Loki agrees, too.

2294
02:55:53,760 --> 02:55:56,760
I didn't agree to shit.

2295
02:55:56,760 --> 02:56:01,760
If I don't go and eat fast food, where am I going to get my Best Buy bucks? Really?

2296
02:56:01,760 --> 02:56:03,760
Steal them?

2297
02:56:03,760 --> 02:56:05,760
Yeah, six months.

2298
02:56:05,760 --> 02:56:11,760
See, that's the same type of consumerism crap that's got this country buried, I swear.

2299
02:56:11,760 --> 02:56:13,260
Eh?

2300
02:56:13,260 --> 02:56:17,260
Loki just took out like $20 in Best Buy bucks.

2301
02:56:17,260 --> 02:56:18,260
$22, actually.

2302
02:56:18,260 --> 02:56:20,760
Do you know when the last time I ate fast food was?

2303
02:56:20,760 --> 02:56:21,760
When?

2304
02:56:21,760 --> 02:56:25,760
Two weeks ago, when I bought a salad.

2305
02:56:25,760 --> 02:56:27,760
Okay, now what is considered fast food?

2306
02:56:27,760 --> 02:56:30,760
Because I don't want X to get off on a technicality.

2307
02:56:30,760 --> 02:56:33,760
I don't really consider McDonald's food.

2308
02:56:33,760 --> 02:56:35,760
I'm stepping into a McDonald's.

2309
02:56:35,760 --> 02:56:39,760
Okay, the only thing that you would ever be allowed to buy from a McDonald's would be a salad.

2310
02:56:39,760 --> 02:56:41,260
Okay.

2311
02:56:41,260 --> 02:56:42,560
Cuz their salads are really good.

2312
02:56:42,560 --> 02:56:43,060
Okay, then...

2313
02:56:44,560 --> 02:56:45,060
So...

2314
02:56:45,060 --> 02:56:48,860
So is it any place by a salad, or is it just McDonald's I can buy a salad?

2315
02:56:48,860 --> 02:56:51,060
Any place. If they've got, like, salads...

2316
02:56:51,060 --> 02:56:53,460
Good healthy salads, then that's fine.

2317
02:56:53,460 --> 02:56:54,360
How about this?

2318
02:56:54,360 --> 02:56:56,960
If you go to a place with a drive-thru...

2319
02:56:56,960 --> 02:56:57,660
Yes.

2320
02:56:57,660 --> 02:56:59,160
You can't get anything with meat.

2321
02:56:59,160 --> 02:57:01,660
But, wait, no, cuz that won't work, cuz a chicken salad.

2322
02:57:01,660 --> 02:57:03,560
And... and the apple pie, and...

2323
02:57:03,560 --> 02:57:05,260
Okay, then you can't get anything but a salad.

2324
02:57:05,260 --> 02:57:07,960
The only thing you could give there would be a salad and a drink to go with it.

2325
02:57:07,960 --> 02:57:08,660
Okay.

2326
02:57:08,660 --> 02:57:10,260
Guys are on. I swear.

2327
02:57:10,260 --> 02:57:15,460
I'm gonna I to that tonight and you know is it by my rules of fast food which is

2328
02:57:15,460 --> 02:57:16,020
salad

2329
02:57:16,020 --> 02:57:19,380
also is subway and quiz knows considered fast food

2330
02:57:19,380 --> 02:57:23,300
hello it takes 10 minutes to get fucking sandwich no I don't consider this to be

2331
02:57:23,300 --> 02:57:23,860
fast food

2332
02:57:23,860 --> 02:57:27,740
okay I'm but to raise it up a notch

2333
02:57:27,740 --> 02:57:30,860
I won't even eat those you can have salad

2334
02:57:30,860 --> 02:57:34,180
no I I I do not

2335
02:57:34,180 --> 02:57:38,140
I do not believe you can go six months without I I will not believe it what I

2336
02:57:38,140 --> 02:57:43,420
What are you gonna eat? I'm gonna eat Nippon every night is what you're gonna eat. Isn't Nippon fast food?

2337
02:57:43,420 --> 02:57:47,200
It's Japanese fast food, so I can't even eat that fast food

2338
02:57:47,200 --> 02:57:52,380
It takes like five minutes of repair you can eat you can eat like a regular restaurant like Applebee's or Chili's, okay?

2339
02:57:52,380 --> 02:57:55,900
That's fine. You can get salads from these places

2340
02:57:56,020 --> 02:57:56,540
Okay

2341
02:57:56,540 --> 02:58:01,740
Because salads are good healthy food right, but other than that anything that you eat that you take to work

2342
02:58:01,740 --> 02:58:03,920
You have to take your lunch to work, okay?

2343
02:58:03,920 --> 02:58:09,000
you cannot eat burgers or anything unless you go buy meat and grill

2344
02:58:09,000 --> 02:58:13,320
yourself a burger okay I go to Outback because I have I will seriously do this

2345
02:58:13,320 --> 02:58:17,480
you guys are totally on you guys are totally you guys are gonna be eating my

2346
02:58:17,480 --> 02:58:23,000
ass we'll give you some leeway tomorrow is Halloween you can eat your candy corn

2347
02:58:23,000 --> 02:58:27,360
I'm starting it tonight because I'm starting my dad on the first okay so that

2348
02:58:27,360 --> 02:58:32,800
way I can monitor okay I feel so cool this is gonna be neat so starting on the

2349
02:58:32,800 --> 02:58:38,920
first what's what's halfway through that's gonna be we should have like a

2350
02:58:38,920 --> 02:58:42,640
Biggest Loser competition where every Orange Lawns radio show we have to all

2351
02:58:42,640 --> 02:58:48,840
stand on a weight scale. Well how about this, how about this, we'll go since we're starting here the

2352
02:58:48,840 --> 02:58:55,880
six-month mark will actually be my wedding day so I'm up for this I'm up

2353
02:58:55,880 --> 02:59:00,480
for a Biggest Loser competition okay I will we can do without giving out our

2354
02:59:00,480 --> 02:59:08,720
our weights on the air. It's not really fair to me since I've dropped

2355
02:59:08,720 --> 02:59:13,600
60 pounds since 2003. Then you're the host, you're the moderator.

2356
02:59:13,600 --> 02:59:19,560
I'm the mediator, but I'm participating too. Forget all this other fast food stuff, it's

2357
02:59:19,560 --> 02:59:24,760
just going to be strictly the biggest loser. Whoever loses the most weight in, let's make

2358
02:59:24,760 --> 02:59:29,760
it less than six months, because our listeners don't want to wait that long.

2359
02:59:29,760 --> 02:59:32,320
I also, though, I also, though, I can't rely on weight.

2360
02:59:32,320 --> 02:59:34,480
Being myself, seeing as how, okay,

2361
02:59:34,480 --> 02:59:35,680
I will go ahead and say it on the air,

2362
02:59:35,680 --> 02:59:36,940
I'm a size 12 right now.

2363
02:59:36,940 --> 02:59:40,800
The last time I was a size 12, I was 30 pounds lighter.

2364
02:59:40,800 --> 02:59:44,200
So how about whoever loses the most inches off their waist?

2365
02:59:47,120 --> 02:59:49,280
Whoever loses the most clothing sizes.

2366
02:59:49,280 --> 02:59:50,800
Whoever loses the most, I don't know.

2367
02:59:50,800 --> 02:59:52,000
See, now we're getting too complicated

2368
02:59:52,000 --> 02:59:53,380
and we're running out of show.

2369
02:59:53,380 --> 02:59:55,280
That's easy, it's not dependent on weight,

2370
02:59:55,280 --> 02:59:58,560
it's not dependent on your, really, your metabolism.

2371
02:59:58,560 --> 03:00:02,600
Whoever loses the most clothing sizes.

2372
03:00:02,600 --> 03:00:03,960
I'm still on the fast food thing.

2373
03:00:03,960 --> 03:00:04,960
I swear, though.

2374
03:00:04,960 --> 03:00:05,960
Fast food for me.

2375
03:00:05,960 --> 03:00:06,960
Here it is.

2376
03:00:06,960 --> 03:00:13,880
If Christopher can actually go six months with no fast food, I'm trying to think of something

2377
03:00:13,880 --> 03:00:14,880
I'll do.

2378
03:00:14,880 --> 03:00:15,880
Ew.

2379
03:00:15,880 --> 03:00:16,880
No.

2380
03:00:16,880 --> 03:00:17,880
No.

2381
03:00:17,880 --> 03:00:18,880
No.

2382
03:00:18,880 --> 03:00:19,880
No.

2383
03:00:19,880 --> 03:00:20,880
No.

2384
03:00:20,880 --> 03:00:23,880
All sorts of meat.

2385
03:00:23,880 --> 03:00:24,880
Okay.

2386
03:00:24,880 --> 03:00:29,820
whose mind is in the gutter

2387
03:00:29,820 --> 03:00:32,980
what we'll go ahead and do because there

2388
03:00:32,980 --> 03:00:35,600
it is a good motivated for everybody

2389
03:00:35,600 --> 03:00:41,560
it's just we are also they're going to test the m i

2390
03:00:41,560 --> 03:00:43,360
by me i hate it

2391
03:00:43,360 --> 03:00:46,760
yeah that bm is the most accurate way to test that one

2392
03:00:46,760 --> 03:00:47,760
uh...

2393
03:00:47,760 --> 03:00:51,280
i'm going to get by the m i counter

2394
03:00:51,280 --> 03:00:54,120
hide me will do it by bm i

2395
03:00:54,120 --> 03:00:58,360
Sounds good to me.

2396
03:00:58,360 --> 03:01:02,720
Six months, though, is an awfully long time for this to finish, to play out.

2397
03:01:02,720 --> 03:01:07,760
It's April, right? Isn't it six months April? We, we can go, we can make it.

2398
03:01:07,760 --> 03:01:12,040
You remember how we were saying our lease? I'm not, I am not committing to the

2399
03:01:12,040 --> 03:01:15,720
fast food thing because of my lifestyle. I just know I won't be able to do it. I am

2400
03:01:15,720 --> 03:01:18,280
freely admitting that I will cut back. I'll cut back.

2401
03:01:18,280 --> 03:01:22,120
I will. If we're doing like a physical dessert, I will participate.

2402
03:01:22,120 --> 03:01:26,220
And I'll tell you what, I will make a private live journal community for us,

2403
03:01:26,220 --> 03:01:30,280
but we are going to post running things on the site, and most,

2404
03:01:30,280 --> 03:01:35,740
so without giving any specifics out, and then we'll be able to let our listeners,

2405
03:01:35,740 --> 03:01:39,560
and if our listeners want to participate in this, you know, we'll think of something,

2406
03:01:40,500 --> 03:01:44,180
but I think, you know, because we'd have to have some way to track that,

2407
03:01:44,180 --> 03:01:48,180
but you guys, I'll see you in person, so, but, you know, I encourage our listeners

2408
03:01:48,180 --> 03:01:49,520
to participate with us on their own.

2409
03:01:49,520 --> 03:01:52,520
If you don't let me have diet soda, I'm going to cry.

2410
03:01:52,520 --> 03:01:53,520
Yay!

2411
03:01:53,520 --> 03:01:56,520
So Angel's going to participate. I'm going to do it.

2412
03:01:56,520 --> 03:01:58,520
X-Ray's going to do it. Are you doing it too, Loki?

2413
03:01:58,520 --> 03:02:00,520
I'm going to eat all fast food!

2414
03:02:00,520 --> 03:02:02,520
Shut up! No you're not.

2415
03:02:02,520 --> 03:02:03,520
Yes I am!

2416
03:02:03,520 --> 03:02:05,520
You're going to be the biggest gainer?

2417
03:02:09,520 --> 03:02:11,520
Well that's a good W.

2418
03:02:11,520 --> 03:02:13,520
Oh no!

2419
03:02:13,520 --> 03:02:17,520
Okay, so Angel, myself, and X-Ray will be the biggest losers.

2420
03:02:17,520 --> 03:02:23,520
Which means I have to tell the entire house when I get back, no faster than six months!

2421
03:02:23,520 --> 03:02:25,520
And they're going to give me like...

2422
03:02:25,520 --> 03:02:31,520
And to encourage everybody, if anyone wants to go work out, if I'm free, I'll work out with you.

2423
03:02:31,520 --> 03:02:34,520
I'm doing all my own too.

2424
03:02:34,520 --> 03:02:36,520
I can encourage everybody.

2425
03:02:36,520 --> 03:02:38,520
And we're getting a metal pad, so I'll be fine.

2426
03:02:38,520 --> 03:02:40,520
Six months is too damn long.

2427
03:02:40,520 --> 03:02:46,400
you know it though I want to one of the reasons why I'm doing it is because I

2428
03:02:46,400 --> 03:02:50,880
want to see what kind of benefits this will this will give me you know in terms

2429
03:02:50,880 --> 03:02:55,280
of financial because I know that a lot of money because you know living in an

2430
03:02:55,280 --> 03:03:00,560
apartment and you know this whole lifestyle is spent on that food and of

2431
03:03:00,560 --> 03:03:05,920
course health wise it'll be good and I think that overall it'll be a good thing

2432
03:03:05,920 --> 03:03:11,680
so I say six months and I will be committed to it I won't drink I can't I

2433
03:03:11,680 --> 03:03:18,120
can't drink anyway so I mean it's kind of cool anyway hello okay my microphone

2434
03:03:18,120 --> 03:03:22,440
works okay we're going way too far so I do not think the six months because if

2435
03:03:22,440 --> 03:03:25,080
you do it for six months you're eventually gonna get yourself into some

2436
03:03:25,080 --> 03:03:29,760
healthier habits anyway how the hell do we get into this topic anyway it's just

2437
03:03:29,760 --> 03:03:31,760
happened it was his fault

2438
03:03:31,760 --> 03:03:35,000
yes

2439
03:03:35,000 --> 03:03:35,900
extrovert

2440
03:03:35,900 --> 03:03:37,380
well let's talk about

2441
03:03:37,380 --> 03:03:41,440
food banks who want some uh... supersized fried

2442
03:03:41,440 --> 03:03:45,620
and sounds good right now brother fucking disgusting thank you

2443
03:03:45,620 --> 03:03:48,760
i know i was like she was planning on showing up at godary

2444
03:03:48,760 --> 03:03:51,500
dammit i was planning on getting pizza head after the show tonight now i have

2445
03:03:51,500 --> 03:03:54,860
to set a fucking example of my roommate who just made a fucking stupid bet

2446
03:03:54,860 --> 03:04:00,240
i don't know how i've been looking for every month you have failed ten dollars

2447
03:04:00,240 --> 03:04:03,800
you pay for the show we're going to think of a prize that you

2448
03:04:03,800 --> 03:04:06,200
if you make it

2449
03:04:06,200 --> 03:04:08,980
i will take you out to dinner

2450
03:04:08,980 --> 03:04:10,820
wherever you want whatever you want it

2451
03:04:10,820 --> 03:04:15,120
you're not going to change your lifestyle for six months for a fucking free dinner

2452
03:04:15,120 --> 03:04:17,220
that it sounds good to me

2453
03:04:17,220 --> 03:04:19,420
i think you know it you you had

2454
03:04:19,420 --> 03:04:20,660
free dinners

2455
03:04:20,660 --> 03:04:24,340
pretty good when you're living on your own you know you know what i mean

2456
03:04:24,340 --> 03:04:29,300
Alright, alright, so, yeah, I can see Loki, like, every week coming in with a big old

2457
03:04:29,300 --> 03:04:30,300
burger in front of it.

2458
03:04:30,300 --> 03:04:33,180
I will think of a prize as well to sweeten up at the pot.

2459
03:04:33,180 --> 03:04:34,180
Okay.

2460
03:04:34,180 --> 03:04:35,180
Okay.

2461
03:04:35,180 --> 03:04:36,780
I'll take it or not, sir.

2462
03:04:36,780 --> 03:04:37,780
That sounds good.

2463
03:04:37,780 --> 03:04:41,140
I'm gonna switch from single quarter pounders to double quarter pounders.

2464
03:04:41,140 --> 03:04:47,100
I was gonna say something, but, like, I'll just do that out there.

2465
03:04:47,100 --> 03:04:48,260
End of show.

2466
03:04:48,260 --> 03:04:49,260
Final thoughts.

2467
03:04:49,260 --> 03:04:51,940
Angel, your final thought.

2468
03:04:51,940 --> 03:04:53,220
I think I can do this.

2469
03:04:53,220 --> 03:04:58,220
We'll have to go yell at the roomies at home and tell them, no fast food, ever.

2470
03:04:58,220 --> 03:05:01,220
Next up for our final thought.

2471
03:05:01,220 --> 03:05:07,220
Oh, if somebody in chat wanted to hear the drum roll one more time.

2472
03:05:07,220 --> 03:05:10,220
Thank you.

2473
03:05:10,220 --> 03:05:14,220
That sounds like a really messed up warlock, I mean, murloc.

2474
03:05:14,220 --> 03:05:15,220
Addict.

2475
03:05:15,220 --> 03:05:17,220
I am Sam Drumroll or something.

2476
03:05:17,220 --> 03:05:19,220
Low key, your final thought.

2477
03:05:19,220 --> 03:05:29,220
My final thought is, this is the perfect week for me to actually roll out my hybrid beef-slash-sausage hamburger with double bacon, double cheese.

2478
03:05:30,220 --> 03:05:31,220
Yummy.

2479
03:05:31,220 --> 03:05:33,220
I'm gonna fuckin' be sick.

2480
03:05:33,220 --> 03:05:38,220
You know what? Here it is. Six months. If you can go six months, I'll buy you a fuckin' DS.

2481
03:05:39,220 --> 03:05:41,220
Shit. I'm not gonna try that.

2482
03:05:41,220 --> 03:05:42,220
Okay.

2483
03:05:42,220 --> 03:05:43,220
I'll give you like ten bucks.

2484
03:05:43,220 --> 03:05:46,220
I'll give you a fuckin' DS if you can go six months.

2485
03:05:46,220 --> 03:05:47,220
Okay.

2486
03:05:47,220 --> 03:05:48,220
I'll buy you a puppy.

2487
03:05:48,220 --> 03:05:52,280
uh...

2488
03:05:52,280 --> 03:05:55,740
uh... my final thought would be uh...

2489
03:05:55,740 --> 03:05:57,220
experts crazy

2490
03:05:57,220 --> 03:05:59,660
uh...

2491
03:05:59,660 --> 03:06:04,140
uh... reject of icons and even better reject fast food

2492
03:06:04,140 --> 03:06:04,860
uh...

2493
03:06:04,860 --> 03:06:06,200
package that room

2494
03:06:06,200 --> 03:06:08,240
package that room

2495
03:06:08,240 --> 03:06:11,820
there's going to be a betting pool for the fucking biggest loser contest

2496
03:06:11,820 --> 03:06:13,440
revenue

2497
03:06:13,440 --> 03:06:15,140
that on me

2498
03:06:15,140 --> 03:06:18,340
I think I already won since I did drop 60 pounds.

2499
03:06:18,340 --> 03:06:20,380
Which you're not participating in this competition.

2500
03:06:20,380 --> 03:06:22,780
I'm monitoring because I'm the health guru of the station.

2501
03:06:22,780 --> 03:06:23,780
You're setting an example.

2502
03:06:23,780 --> 03:06:24,780
I'm the example.

2503
03:06:24,780 --> 03:06:25,780
I'm so cool.

2504
03:06:25,780 --> 03:06:26,780
Odds are in.

2505
03:06:26,780 --> 03:06:32,260
Loki is 99 to 1 odds.

2506
03:06:32,260 --> 03:06:33,260
God I love you guys.

2507
03:06:33,260 --> 03:06:34,500
I'm going to get in on that action.

2508
03:06:34,500 --> 03:06:35,900
I fucking love you guys.

2509
03:06:35,900 --> 03:06:36,900
Alright.

2510
03:06:36,900 --> 03:06:37,900
Seriously?

2511
03:06:37,900 --> 03:06:40,020
Chat room you people make this show and everybody that listens.

2512
03:06:40,020 --> 03:06:41,940
We love you chat room.

2513
03:06:41,940 --> 03:06:42,940
Alright.

2514
03:06:42,940 --> 03:06:48,620
motivate us to be thin. Actually, I have one other thing. For all of my fellow Gorillaz

2515
03:06:48,620 --> 03:06:55,620
fans, they're broadcasting the Manchester show on BBC One, streaming. BBC One! BBC

2516
03:06:55,620 --> 03:07:02,620
Two! Alright, anyway. Fuck it, we gotta end the show already. Okay, bye! Last word! Loki!

2517
03:07:02,620 --> 03:07:11,620

2520
03:07:26,660 --> 03:07:27,660
of the day.

2521
03:07:27,660 --> 03:07:39,980
Hello, boys and girls. This is your old pal, Stinky Wizzle Teeth. This is a song about

2522
03:07:39,980 --> 03:07:49,380
a player. No! This is a song about being happy. That's right. It's the Happy, Happy, Joy,

2523
03:07:49,380 --> 03:08:10,540
I don't think you're happy enough, that's right.

2524
03:08:10,540 --> 03:08:12,980
I'll teach you to be happy.

2525
03:08:12,980 --> 03:08:15,860
I'll teach your grandmother to suck eggs.

2526
03:08:15,860 --> 03:08:20,320
Now boys and girl let's try it again.

2527
03:08:20,320 --> 03:08:23,680
Happy Happy Joy Joy! Happy Happy Joy Joy!

2528
03:08:23,680 --> 03:08:27,020
Happy Happy Joy Joy! Happy Happy Joy Joy!

2529
03:08:27,020 --> 03:08:30,380
Happy Happy Joy Joy! Happy Happy Joy Joy!

2530

Happy Happy Joy Joy Joy!

2531
03:08:33,720 --> 03:08:37,900
It's the Newical sinker of all honor!

2532
03:08:37,900 --> 03:08:39,260
The little critters of nature.

2533
03:08:39,260 --> 03:08:41,720
They don't know they are ugly.

2534
03:08:41,720 --> 03:08:43,420
That's very funny a

2535
03:08:43,420 --> 03:08:45,500
A butterfly marrying a bumblebee

2536
03:08:46,400 --> 03:08:48,080
I told you I'd shoot

2537
03:08:48,080 --> 03:08:50,000
But you didn't believe me

2538
03:08:50,000 --> 03:08:52,100
Why didn't you believe me?

2539
03:08:53,440 --> 03:09:01,780
Happy, happy, joy, joy

2540
03:09:01,780 --> 03:09:03,400
Happy, happy, joy, joy.

2541
03:09:03,400 --> 03:09:10,400
Happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, joy, joy, joy.

2542
03:09:10,400 --> 03:09:17,400
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.

2543
03:09:40,400 --> 03:10:01,120
kostjamrh The guys just did their weigh-ins for the, uh,

2544
03:10:01,120 --> 03:10:06,120
We're not going to say our weight, because the whole idea is that we don't have to say our weight, but oh my God, I was surprised.

2545
03:10:06,120 --> 03:10:10,120
I hit a certain landmark that I didn't think I was over yet, and I'm like, oh, fuck.

2546
03:10:10,120 --> 03:10:14,120
All right, so we'll see what happens.

2547
03:10:14,120 --> 03:10:17,120
Did I really tell ExtraFryd buy him a DS? God, I'm poor.

2548
03:10:17,120 --> 03:10:20,120
Yes, you did. We have proof of that.

2549
03:10:20,120 --> 03:10:25,120
That's fine. If he can go six months without fast food, he earned it, and I bet you anything, Jay will get in on that, too.

2550
03:10:25,120 --> 03:10:26,120
I'll bet you anything.

2551
03:10:26,120 --> 03:10:31,120
I'm telling you right now, I'm at a plateau right now where I can eat as much fast food as I want, and I stay the same weight, so you know what?

2552
03:10:31,120 --> 03:10:33,120
To be fair, you can see what I'm at.

2553
03:10:33,120 --> 03:10:35,120
Okay, okay.

2554
03:10:35,120 --> 03:10:36,120
That's what I'm at.

2555
03:10:36,120 --> 03:10:40,120
Okay. Oh, you are going to participate too then, Ms. J?

2556
03:10:40,120 --> 03:10:42,120
As a motivator for everybody.

2557
03:10:42,120 --> 03:10:45,120
I can't lose. So we're going to track this on the website, like how much weight we all...

2558
03:10:45,120 --> 03:10:47,120
I'm not eligible for any prizes.

2559
03:10:47,120 --> 03:10:52,120
I'm still moderating it, so I'm not eligible for any prizes, but I'm doing it for motivation purposes.

2560
03:10:52,120 --> 03:10:54,120
It's going to be a crazy six months, gang.

2561
03:10:54,120 --> 03:10:57,740
yeah but I've needed to do it since I met you guys so you know what

2562
03:10:57,740 --> 03:11:01,900
it's time to go. One thing though that you need to point this out

2563
03:11:01,900 --> 03:11:06,080
just having come to this myself, I went from 255

2564
03:11:06,080 --> 03:11:10,440
I don't mind saying it, I'm at 195 now and I did that in two years

2565
03:11:10,440 --> 03:11:13,920
I did that in two years so if I can do that

2566
03:11:13,920 --> 03:11:17,120
in two years and I lost the bulk of it in my first six months

2567
03:11:17,120 --> 03:11:20,140
so trust me, you weren't able to do it

2568
03:11:20,140 --> 03:11:22,640
If everybody stays on, it's going to be easy.
