[SPEAKER_10]: No, it tasted like burrito.

36
00:05:40,525 --> 00:05:41,085
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what's funny?

37
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:45,446
[SPEAKER_07]: I think your mic faded out right at the point where you burped, so it didn't pick it up even, which is great.

38
00:05:45,866 --> 00:05:46,467
Burp!

39
00:05:46,667 --> 00:05:47,207

00:05:54,272 --> 00:05:56,994
[SPEAKER_07]: You seem a little withdrawn tonight, giving me one-word answers.

45
00:05:57,894 --> 00:06:00,356
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, I just haven't gotten into the show yet.

00:06:22,283 --> 00:06:25,365

[SPEAKER_10]: I'm good.

59
00:06:29,507 --> 00:06:33,729
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I've got a lot of stuff to talk about, but I guess we can talk about that later.

60
00:06:33,749 --> 00:06:34,069
[SPEAKER_10]: Good!

61
00:06:34,109 --> 00:06:38,271
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I have news about said convention from this weekend.

62
00:06:38,311 --> 00:06:39,372
[SPEAKER_10]: Hint, elbow, hint.

63
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:40,432
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you go to BlizzCon?

64
00:06:40,612 --> 00:06:41,053
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I didn't.

65
00:06:41,213 --> 00:06:41,333
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh.

66
00:06:41,393 --> 00:06:42,733
[SPEAKER_10]: I know a lot of news about it.

67
00:06:42,753 --> 00:06:43,994
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, the fuck?

68
00:06:44,034 --> 00:06:46,155
[SPEAKER_07]: We had representation at BlizzCon?

69
00:06:46,976 --> 00:06:47,016
[SPEAKER_10]: Um...

70
00:06:47,896 --> 00:06:48,376
[SPEAKER_10]: Sort of.

71
00:06:48,756 --> 00:06:54,139
[SPEAKER_10]: I kind of had my ins as far as finding out about stuff even though I wasn't there.

72
00:06:54,419 --> 00:06:55,239
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, does that make sense?

73
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,240
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I gotcha.

74
00:06:58,241 --> 00:07:02,383
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll talk about my relationship with Blizzard Entertainment in a little while.

75
00:07:03,243 --> 00:07:04,404
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll talk about that when we come back.

76
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:05,024
[SPEAKER_07]: How's that sound?

77
00:07:05,124 --> 00:07:05,644
[SPEAKER_10]: No, that's fine.

78
00:07:05,684 --> 00:07:15,309
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanted to, like, you know... No, I love Blizzard now, which is ironic because I used to think they were so overrated, but ever since I started playing World of Warcraft and can't fucking stop...

79
00:07:15,989 --> 00:07:19,371
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm suddenly like, ooh, I want to go to BlizzCon!

80
00:07:19,411 --> 00:07:24,112
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no, I will not tell you what I ran last, er, like, 15 minutes ago.

81
00:07:24,453 --> 00:07:24,693
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

82
00:07:25,213 --> 00:07:26,713
[SPEAKER_10]: Zofarok, you don't want to run that.

83
00:07:27,054 --> 00:07:27,334
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

84
00:07:27,354 --> 00:07:33,816
[SPEAKER_10]: It's called Zofarok, it's like, yeah, like this really big instance thing, and it hurts in the end.

85
00:07:34,056 --> 00:07:35,897
[SPEAKER_07]: Isn't that that new movie, like Jumanji?

86
00:07:38,898 --> 00:07:40,979
[SPEAKER_07]: Or is that the medication you take when you're depressed?

87
00:07:41,119 --> 00:07:42,740
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a lot, I don't know.

88
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:44,181
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura

89
00:08:07,926 --> 00:08:12,709
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't even know if what she's got on the screen is related to the show.

90
00:08:12,769 --> 00:08:15,811
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm looking at Playgirl models.

91
00:08:17,873 --> 00:08:19,113
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go to a break, kids.

92
00:08:19,173 --> 00:08:22,095
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll be back after this with more... I'm looking at naked Daryl Hannah.

93
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:23,996
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, sorry.

94
00:08:24,157 --> 00:08:26,718
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm actually going to be ordering Clint at the cave fair.

95
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:28,439
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys are so weird.

96
00:08:28,459 --> 00:08:29,460
[SPEAKER_10]: And Iguana Girl says hi.

97
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,281
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, right on.

98
00:08:31,982 --> 00:08:33,903
[SPEAKER_08]: Is her people hair gray and wiry?

99
00:08:35,066 --> 00:08:35,346
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

100
00:08:35,927 --> 00:08:36,727
[SPEAKER_08]: Daryl Hannah.

101
00:08:37,268 --> 00:08:37,828
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

102
00:08:38,469 --> 00:08:39,930
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I thought you were talking about Iguana Girl.

103
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:40,531
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, what?

104
00:08:40,671 --> 00:08:41,511
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, no, no, no, no.

105
00:08:41,671 --> 00:08:43,053
[SPEAKER_08]: I was talking about Daryl Hannah.

106
00:08:44,234 --> 00:08:47,296
[SPEAKER_08]: But is Iguana Girls... No, I'm kidding.

107
00:08:48,517 --> 00:08:49,658
[SPEAKER_07]: On that note, let's go to a break.

108
00:08:52,153 --> 00:08:53,174
[SPEAKER_07]: And we'll be back after this.

109
00:08:53,234 --> 00:09:01,704
[SPEAKER_07]: And we might actually talk about some music game stuff, because apparently Ultramix 3, the song list released, and there's a concert coming to town, and all this other garbage I want to talk about too.

110
00:09:01,964 --> 00:09:02,765
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll be back after this.

111
00:09:03,005 --> 00:09:04,667
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, join our chat room, won't you?

112
00:09:04,807 --> 00:09:06,529
[SPEAKER_07]: OrangeLoungeRadio.com, click on chat.

113
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:11,014
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll start it off this break with a little bit of Taku from 2DX4Style.

114
00:09:11,154 --> 00:09:11,555
[SPEAKER_07]: Enjoy.

115
00:10:14,222 --> 00:10:15,187
Thank you for watching!

116
00:15:26,724 --> 00:15:31,025
Gaming Radio, so uncensored that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.

117
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:31,945
Orange Lounge Radio.

118
00:15:55,117 --> 00:15:57,321
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, we're here.

119
00:15:57,401 --> 00:15:58,402
[SPEAKER_10]: I like burritos, Rob.

120
00:15:59,175 --> 00:15:59,595
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you?

121
00:15:59,775 --> 00:16:00,256
[SPEAKER_08]: That's good to hear.

122
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:01,396
[SPEAKER_08]: It sounds like it.

123
00:16:01,596 --> 00:16:02,597
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, literally.

124
00:16:02,837 --> 00:16:03,897
[SPEAKER_10]: It smells like it, too.

125
00:16:04,578 --> 00:16:05,298
[SPEAKER_07]: We all know.

126
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:07,379
[SPEAKER_07]: That mic's getting retired before the end of the night.

127
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:08,500
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what's going on with it.

128
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:10,821
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, this microphone sucks a big chunk of ass.

129
00:16:10,941 --> 00:16:11,881
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's what it is.

130
00:16:11,901 --> 00:16:13,362
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you want me to pick up a new mic?

131
00:16:14,022 --> 00:16:14,623
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you going to Target?

132
00:16:14,643 --> 00:16:15,643
[SPEAKER_08]: And you can reimburse me?

133
00:16:16,243 --> 00:16:16,604
[SPEAKER_07]: F yes.

134
00:16:16,664 --> 00:16:18,084
[SPEAKER_08]: Go to Target and get a new mic.

135
00:16:19,285 --> 00:16:20,505
[SPEAKER_08]: That's awesome.

136
00:16:21,486 --> 00:16:22,667
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm so awesome, aren't I?

137
00:16:22,927 --> 00:16:23,707
[SPEAKER_07]: You're okay.

138
00:16:24,467 --> 00:16:24,567
[SPEAKER_08]: Aww.

139
00:16:26,297 --> 00:16:27,759
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, so we'll get that fixed.

140
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:29,561
[SPEAKER_07]: Good, that means I'll be fixed before the podcast.

141
00:16:29,581 --> 00:16:30,182
[SPEAKER_07]: That makes me happy.

142
00:16:31,524 --> 00:16:31,965
[SPEAKER_07]: So anyway.

143
00:16:33,426 --> 00:16:34,348
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow, that kind of threw me.

144
00:16:35,149 --> 00:16:39,555
[SPEAKER_07]: I just think it would be really funny if one day we were at a break and then we just didn't come back.

145
00:16:40,956 --> 00:16:42,999
[SPEAKER_07]: You just kind of hear the music in the background and we're not there.

146
00:16:43,905 --> 00:16:45,226
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, maybe we already pulled that rank.

147
00:16:45,246 --> 00:16:45,546
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

148
00:16:46,146 --> 00:16:48,327
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, hi, you're listening to Orange Sounds Radio.

149
00:16:48,347 --> 00:16:48,727
[SPEAKER_07]: We are here.

150
00:16:48,747 --> 00:16:49,247
[SPEAKER_07]: We are live.

151
00:16:49,348 --> 00:16:55,770
[SPEAKER_07]: I noticed, just judging from the names I see in chat room, we have quite a few people tonight who haven't listened before.

152
00:16:56,291 --> 00:17:03,634
[SPEAKER_07]: And judging from what's been going on in general in the past 10 months, we have more and more people listening to us thanks to our podcast, which I think, you know, that's awesome.

153
00:17:03,694 --> 00:17:05,115
[SPEAKER_07]: That was the whole idea.

154
00:17:05,155 --> 00:17:11,878
[SPEAKER_07]: We did a podcast in the first place because we were like, oh, maybe we'll get like two or three people listening to the podcast that will come over and then listen to our live show.

155
00:17:12,378 --> 00:17:16,581
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the fucking podcast gets like 40 times the listeners our live show gets.

156
00:17:16,641 --> 00:17:17,301
[SPEAKER_07]: It's crazy.

157
00:17:17,741 --> 00:17:18,542
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's cool.

158
00:17:18,562 --> 00:17:18,922
[SPEAKER_07]: We love it.

159
00:17:18,962 --> 00:17:22,784
[SPEAKER_07]: We love the fact that people are listening to it and just loving it.

160
00:17:23,165 --> 00:17:24,946
[SPEAKER_07]: But I do got to warn people.

161
00:17:25,899 --> 00:17:26,580
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

162
00:17:50,922 --> 00:17:52,683
[SPEAKER_07]: What's happened to the DDR Freak boards?

163
00:17:52,783 --> 00:17:53,303
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like this.

164
00:17:53,383 --> 00:17:59,126
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, we're dedicated, this show is dedicated to music games like MTV is dedicated to music.

165
00:17:59,206 --> 00:18:00,847
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, that's a great analogy.

166
00:18:02,868 --> 00:18:04,309
[SPEAKER_07]: We are the MTV of music gaming.

167
00:18:04,529 --> 00:18:07,470
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't really say anything too bad about the DDR Freak boards, though.

168
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:09,011
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm not saying a negative thing at all.

169
00:18:09,031 --> 00:18:12,293
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no, no, not just because I moderate there, but because I've seen worse.

170
00:18:13,061 --> 00:18:13,341
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.

171
00:18:13,581 --> 00:18:13,801
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no.

172
00:18:14,182 --> 00:18:14,902
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not saying anything.

173
00:18:14,922 --> 00:18:18,403
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, if I wanted to say something negative about the DDR Freak Boards, I'd go to a different topic.

174
00:18:18,483 --> 00:18:29,809
[SPEAKER_07]: But the DDR Freak Boards in general, if you notice where the majority of posts are, well, maybe not the majority, but the real active users and the long-time users all kind of flock to one forum.

175
00:18:30,649 --> 00:18:31,409
[SPEAKER_07]: Random chat.

176
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:35,171
[SPEAKER_07]: So we are the random chat of the Internet.

177
00:18:35,251 --> 00:18:35,611
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

178
00:18:36,612 --> 00:18:38,833
[SPEAKER_10]: Random chat lately is the bane of my existence.

179
00:18:41,514 --> 00:18:41,794
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

180
00:18:44,195 --> 00:18:45,435
[SPEAKER_07]: That is a great analogy.

181
00:18:45,495 --> 00:18:46,415
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, that was great.

182
00:18:46,435 --> 00:18:48,556
[SPEAKER_07]: We're like MTV is to music.

183
00:18:49,996 --> 00:18:52,277
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, oh, even the chat room agrees.

184
00:18:52,617 --> 00:18:54,717
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki wins the show, says MPQ.

185
00:18:54,797 --> 00:18:55,157
[SPEAKER_07]: Good job.

186
00:18:55,517 --> 00:18:56,778
[SPEAKER_07]: G4 is going the same way.

187
00:18:57,558 --> 00:18:59,138
[SPEAKER_07]: G4 has nothing to do with Games Day.

188
00:18:59,158 --> 00:19:04,079
[SPEAKER_07]: G4 is young man television, and it's a stretch of that.

189
00:19:04,199 --> 00:19:05,640
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm confused by G4.

190
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:06,780
[SPEAKER_04]: They confuse me.

191
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,040
[SPEAKER_04]: First off, why are they playing Fastlane?

192
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:12,201
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that show shouldn't be on air at any station.

193
00:19:12,563 --> 00:19:12,843
[SPEAKER_07]: DJ Ranma S

194
00:19:32,813 --> 00:19:36,954
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, just because there was a lesbian couple in Wonderfalls, they put on the whole show.

195
00:19:37,534 --> 00:19:38,995
[SPEAKER_08]: Logo, by the way, being the gay and lesbian.

196
00:19:39,015 --> 00:19:39,655
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, gay and lesbian.

197
00:19:39,715 --> 00:19:40,175
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.

198
00:19:40,535 --> 00:19:47,037
[SPEAKER_08]: For all of you people that don't like to be fucked up the ass, Logo is for gay people.

199
00:19:47,137 --> 00:19:49,157
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

200
00:19:49,637 --> 00:19:51,017
[SPEAKER_08]: My mother watches Logo.

201
00:19:51,358 --> 00:19:52,518
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not just for gay people.

202
00:19:52,578 --> 00:19:53,418
[SPEAKER_08]: It's about gay people.

203
00:19:53,478 --> 00:19:55,299
[SPEAKER_10]: Some people don't have cable.

204
00:19:56,419 --> 00:19:58,339
[SPEAKER_10]: Some of us have to live with Core TV.

205
00:19:58,939 --> 00:19:59,900
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like Bravo?

206
00:20:02,941 --> 00:20:03,901
[SPEAKER_10]: Psychic Detectives.

207
00:20:04,382 --> 00:20:07,643
[SPEAKER_07]: No, Bravo is somehow gayer than Logo still.

208
00:20:07,883 --> 00:20:13,825
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, honestly, fucking A. Project Runway is like the equivalent of an all-male gangbang.

209
00:20:13,905 --> 00:20:17,286
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if you've ever watched this show, Project Runway.

210
00:20:18,147 --> 00:20:18,907
[SPEAKER_07]: It's gay.

211
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:24,409
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's like 10 Madonna videos all back-to-back is what Project Runway is.

212
00:20:24,449 --> 00:20:25,129
[SPEAKER_07]: It is gay.

213
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,270
[SPEAKER_07]: Every guy on that show is gay.

214
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:29,311
[SPEAKER_07]: It's gay, gay, gay, gay, gay.

215
00:20:31,004 --> 00:20:33,107
[SPEAKER_07]: And see, but since I'm gay, I can say that.

216
00:20:33,207 --> 00:20:37,774
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it's like that episode of South Park where Mr. Garrison goes around and calls everybody a fag because he's gay.

217
00:20:37,814 --> 00:20:40,578
[SPEAKER_07]: That's where I can get away saying that, too.

218
00:20:42,901 --> 00:20:43,122
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

219
00:20:45,516 --> 00:20:50,758
[SPEAKER_07]: Dark Sakura, if your microphone will cooperate with you through this segment, how was your week, how was your day?

220
00:21:15,489 --> 00:21:17,310
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, actually, how was the past two weeks?

221
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:17,970
[SPEAKER_07]: That's true.

222
00:21:19,512 --> 00:21:20,072
[SPEAKER_10]: Excuse me.

223
00:21:20,712 --> 00:21:23,014
[SPEAKER_10]: I ate a burrito, and burritos make me burp.

224
00:21:23,835 --> 00:21:25,036
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm also drinking Tab.

225
00:21:26,597 --> 00:21:28,218
[SPEAKER_10]: Tab is like the ultimate drink of the year.

226
00:21:28,238 --> 00:21:30,219
[SPEAKER_07]: Why the fuck are you voluntarily drinking Tab?

227
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:33,762
[SPEAKER_10]: Because the 80s are making a comeback, and not in a good way.

228
00:21:36,969 --> 00:21:43,034
[SPEAKER_07]: If I was on, like, Survivor, and they offered Tab in a reward challenge, I'd be all, fuck you, I'll starve.

229
00:21:43,355 --> 00:21:43,955
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously.

230
00:21:44,215 --> 00:21:45,877
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll drink sand, thank you.

231
00:21:46,197 --> 00:21:51,562
[SPEAKER_07]: I would honestly rather drink ocean water that all the fish have crapped in than Tab.

232
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:55,985
[SPEAKER_10]: But Tab is tabulous.

233
00:21:57,026 --> 00:21:57,787
[SPEAKER_10]: Fantabulous.

234
00:21:58,629 --> 00:22:00,670
[SPEAKER_07]: You know tab backwards is bat?

235
00:22:01,151 --> 00:22:03,632
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's exactly what it tastes like, blended bat.

236
00:22:05,633 --> 00:22:05,893
[SPEAKER_10]: Rob.

237
00:22:06,574 --> 00:22:06,814
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

238
00:22:06,954 --> 00:22:07,174
[SPEAKER_10]: Dear.

239
00:22:07,554 --> 00:22:07,755
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes?

240
00:22:07,835 --> 00:22:09,135
[SPEAKER_10]: Your analogy sucked ass.

241
00:22:09,295 --> 00:22:09,596
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

242
00:22:09,736 --> 00:22:13,118
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm trying to compete with Loki tonight in the analogy department.

243
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:20,482
[SPEAKER_10]: I just got an IM that says you're drinking tab?

244
00:22:20,502 --> 00:22:21,002
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes!

245
00:22:21,063 --> 00:22:25,005
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right, you'd get her.

246
00:22:25,345 --> 00:22:28,027
[SPEAKER_04]: That's almost as bad as, what was that, Tang or...

247
00:22:29,653 --> 00:22:33,294
[SPEAKER_10]: The Drink of the Astronauts, Take to the Moon, Astronauts, Moon!

248
00:22:33,835 --> 00:22:39,457
[SPEAKER_07]: Notice how Tab was conspicuously left out of all three I Love the 80s series on VH1?

249
00:22:40,337 --> 00:22:40,817
[SPEAKER_07]: You know why?

250
00:22:40,997 --> 00:22:42,358
[SPEAKER_07]: Because no one loved Tab.

251
00:22:42,658 --> 00:22:43,798
[SPEAKER_07]: No one loved Tab at all.

252
00:22:43,818 --> 00:22:44,439
[SPEAKER_10]: I love Tab.

253
00:22:45,259 --> 00:22:48,020
[SPEAKER_10]: It tastes, like, gross, but I like it.

254
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:51,741
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what's sad is I woke up this morning... Hey!

255
00:22:52,722 --> 00:22:53,382
[SPEAKER_10]: What about my week?

256
00:22:53,971 --> 00:23:04,498
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we were on the tangent of I Love the 80s, so I was saying, I woke up this morning and I was wondering, how long after it becomes, you know, 2011, will it take VH1 to make the I Love 2000?

257
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,401
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just like... Well, we already have it.

258
00:23:08,501 --> 00:23:09,702
[SPEAKER_07]: It's that show Best Week Ever.

259
00:23:09,882 --> 00:23:13,285
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if you've watched Best Week Ever, but it's basically I Love the Last Week.

260
00:23:14,065 --> 00:23:16,827
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the premise of the show, I Love the Last Week.

261
00:23:16,867 --> 00:23:20,310
[SPEAKER_10]: But you know what drink that we need to have come back besides Crystal Pepsi and Josta?

262
00:23:23,562 --> 00:23:26,925
[SPEAKER_07]: If you say Pepsi Blue, I'm leaving the show.

263
00:23:27,165 --> 00:23:29,147
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I cannot stand Pepsi Blue.

264
00:23:29,367 --> 00:23:30,168
[SPEAKER_07]: Pepsi Blue too.

265
00:23:31,108 --> 00:23:31,949
[SPEAKER_07]: Pepsi Blue.

266
00:23:32,209 --> 00:23:34,031
[SPEAKER_10]: But Tab makes me think of Back to the Future.

267
00:23:34,051 --> 00:23:38,415
[SPEAKER_10]: Where he goes into the bar, another little diner, and says, Give me a Tab.

268
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:40,156
[SPEAKER_10]: You haven't ordered anything yet.

269
00:23:40,176 --> 00:23:41,017
[SPEAKER_10]: You can't have a Tab.

270
00:23:41,497 --> 00:23:42,618
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, then a Pepsi free.

271
00:23:43,139 --> 00:23:45,501
[SPEAKER_10]: Look, if you're going to have a Pepsi, you have to pay for it.

272
00:23:48,724 --> 00:23:49,004
[SPEAKER_10]: Ha ha.

273
00:23:50,443 --> 00:23:52,984
[SPEAKER_07]: The only thing I can think of that's worse than Tab is Pepsi Blue.

274
00:23:53,705 --> 00:23:54,105
[SPEAKER_10]: Nasty.

275
00:23:54,305 --> 00:23:57,827
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, if that were the reward on Survivor, I'd swish it and spit it at the host.

276
00:23:58,047 --> 00:23:58,787
[SPEAKER_07]: It's that awful.

277
00:23:58,827 --> 00:24:00,228
[SPEAKER_07]: Pepsi Blue is god-awful.

278
00:24:01,669 --> 00:24:02,369
[SPEAKER_10]: Dr. Pepper.

279
00:24:02,409 --> 00:24:03,349
[SPEAKER_10]: Vanilla Dr. Pepper.

280
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:03,790
[SPEAKER_10]: Ew.

281
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:07,111
[SPEAKER_10]: The prairie vanilla Dr. Pepper is the nastiest shit ever.

282
00:24:07,171 --> 00:24:07,451
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

283
00:24:08,632 --> 00:24:13,314
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know when we started becoming the soft drink show, but I have to say this.

284
00:24:15,726 --> 00:24:19,211
[SPEAKER_07]: This friend of mine made the best analogy about that diet cherry vanilla, Dr. Pepper.

285
00:24:19,751 --> 00:24:24,298
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't taste like cherry, and it doesn't taste like vanilla, and it really doesn't taste like Dr. Pepper.

286
00:24:25,099 --> 00:24:26,381
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what that's supposed to be.

287
00:24:28,484 --> 00:24:31,047
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like all three of the flavors cancel each other out.

288
00:24:31,467 --> 00:24:33,048
[SPEAKER_07]: And suddenly you've got like Tab.

289
00:24:33,269 --> 00:24:33,609
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

290
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:36,672
[SPEAKER_10]: Roz just told me that Blue Pepsi tasted like medicine.

291
00:24:37,333 --> 00:24:40,536
[SPEAKER_07]: Blue Pep... I would rather drink a bottle of Dayquil.

292
00:24:40,696 --> 00:24:42,137
[SPEAKER_10]: I said it looked like a toilet bowl.

293
00:24:42,337 --> 00:24:43,479
[SPEAKER_08]: I liked Blue Pepsi.

294
00:24:43,739 --> 00:24:44,660
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my god!

295
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:45,320
[SPEAKER_08]: Am I weird?

296
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:46,241
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't kill yourself.

297
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:48,964
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, my week was eventful.

298
00:24:50,025 --> 00:24:51,727
[SPEAKER_10]: I got to stay on a bus.

299
00:24:52,941 --> 00:24:57,344
[SPEAKER_10]: and go to San Francisco on a bus for my field trip last Sunday.

300
00:24:58,524 --> 00:25:02,827
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just sort of played with my puppies on the way and ignored the teacher.

301
00:25:04,388 --> 00:25:10,011
[SPEAKER_10]: But he was giving us a history of different locations on the way in San Francisco and everything, and it was kind of cool.

302
00:25:10,611 --> 00:25:11,172
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait a minute, wait a minute.

303
00:25:11,192 --> 00:25:12,332
[SPEAKER_10]: But we hardly got out of the bus.

304
00:25:12,452 --> 00:25:13,113
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold up, hold up.

305
00:25:14,694 --> 00:25:17,656
[SPEAKER_07]: The last time I went on a field trip, I was in the 11th grade.

306
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:21,991
[SPEAKER_07]: I did not know that they did field trips in college.

307
00:25:22,231 --> 00:25:22,411
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

308
00:25:22,691 --> 00:25:22,851
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

309
00:25:23,191 --> 00:25:26,653
[SPEAKER_10]: I've never... They also do camping trips for like single credits and everything.

310
00:25:26,753 --> 00:25:27,413
[SPEAKER_04]: The hell?

311
00:25:29,014 --> 00:25:31,595
[SPEAKER_04]: If you could take bowling as a sport, they have field trips.

312
00:25:31,895 --> 00:25:33,796
[SPEAKER_10]: This is for cultural geography, so we went over...

313
00:25:34,329 --> 00:25:37,951
[SPEAKER_10]: The different settlements and we went by the first mission in San Francisco.

314
00:25:38,771 --> 00:25:42,854
[SPEAKER_10]: And we also went by, this is my favorite place and I've always wanted to get out and go there.

315
00:25:42,894 --> 00:25:44,655
[SPEAKER_10]: It's by the Exploratorium.

316
00:25:45,535 --> 00:25:49,037
[SPEAKER_10]: The Palace of Fine Art that was there since the World's Fair in 1915.

317
00:25:49,257 --> 00:25:52,819
[SPEAKER_10]: The last standing structure from the World's Fair in 1915.

318
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:58,562
[SPEAKER_10]: And just listening to how most of San Francisco is built on landfill.

319
00:25:59,342 --> 00:26:00,803
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, oh, we have an earthquake.

320
00:26:00,843 --> 00:26:03,485
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's just use all this crap to fill up a lake and build houses on it.

321
00:26:04,125 --> 00:26:05,286
[SPEAKER_10]: Without any real engineering.

322
00:26:05,967 --> 00:26:07,848
[SPEAKER_10]: Really makes me want to live in San Francisco.

323
00:26:08,308 --> 00:26:08,569
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

324
00:26:08,849 --> 00:26:11,151
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you go to the Exploratorium also?

325
00:26:11,391 --> 00:26:11,771
[SPEAKER_10]: No, we didn't.

326
00:26:11,791 --> 00:26:12,151
[SPEAKER_08]: We went.

327
00:26:12,191 --> 00:26:13,092
[SPEAKER_10]: We used their bathroom twice.

328
00:26:13,653 --> 00:26:13,793
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh.

329
00:26:15,014 --> 00:26:16,295
[SPEAKER_08]: I like the Exploratorium.

330
00:26:16,315 --> 00:26:16,675
[SPEAKER_08]: I do too.

331
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:19,677
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I liked it at the very, very back where nobody really went.

332
00:26:19,757 --> 00:26:28,904
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know, you have that big screen where if you dance in front of it, you can see yourself like a silhouette of yourself on the screen dancing and it changes all sorts of colors.

333
00:26:28,924 --> 00:26:29,565
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I'm talking about?

334
00:26:29,585 --> 00:26:30,706
[SPEAKER_10]: They have a place like that in Mobile.

335
00:26:30,766 --> 00:26:32,007
[SPEAKER_10]: It's actually just called the Explorium.

336
00:26:32,407 --> 00:26:32,667
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, really?

337
00:26:32,687 --> 00:26:35,390
[SPEAKER_10]: It's in downtown Mobile, built out of, I think, the old city hall.

338
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:36,991
[SPEAKER_10]: But they have a screen like that.

339
00:26:37,031 --> 00:26:39,733
[SPEAKER_10]: You can do the weird prismatic shapes and everything.

340
00:26:39,813 --> 00:26:40,314
[SPEAKER_10]: That's cool.

341
00:26:40,334 --> 00:26:42,536
[SPEAKER_10]: They used to have animatronic dinosaurs there, too.

342
00:26:44,554 --> 00:26:45,994
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching.

343
00:26:46,134 --> 00:26:46,735
[SPEAKER_07]: See you next time.

344
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:06,780
[SPEAKER_10]: I took pictures.

345
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:09,301
[SPEAKER_10]: I can put them somewhere for people, I guess.

346
00:27:10,662 --> 00:27:12,522
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, that's what I did on Sunday.

347
00:27:12,542 --> 00:27:16,383
[SPEAKER_10]: The rest of my week has just been work and school and going to the chiropractor.

348
00:27:17,464 --> 00:27:19,744
[SPEAKER_10]: My insurance paid for me one of those exercise balls.

349
00:27:20,865 --> 00:27:21,165
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

350
00:27:21,425 --> 00:27:22,425
[SPEAKER_10]: So I've been using it.

351
00:27:24,006 --> 00:27:31,048
[SPEAKER_10]: And my husband's going on South Beach next week, so I'm going back to phase one on it with him.

352
00:27:31,748 --> 00:27:34,349
[SPEAKER_10]: So you're going to be hearing me next week going, I'm hungry!

353
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:36,130
[SPEAKER_10]: I need a burrito.

354
00:27:36,571 --> 00:27:37,971
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll be sitting here eating Pizza Hut.

355
00:27:39,272 --> 00:27:40,993
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, I can eat California Pizza Kitchen.

356
00:27:41,153 --> 00:27:41,473
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you?

357
00:27:41,873 --> 00:27:43,374
[SPEAKER_10]: Because they don't bleach their flour.

358
00:27:43,774 --> 00:27:45,695
[SPEAKER_07]: That's some good stuff at restaurants, too.

359
00:27:46,535 --> 00:27:58,581
[SPEAKER_10]: But, um... But, um, at any rate, I was so worn out that day that when we got onto the Bay Bridge to go back, I opened my eyes again in Vallejo.

360
00:27:59,662 --> 00:28:02,483
[SPEAKER_10]: So, yeah, I was pretty much dead.

361
00:28:04,064 --> 00:28:04,624
[SPEAKER_10]: And, uh...

362
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:10,500
[SPEAKER_10]: Really, the rest of my week has just been crap.

363
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:14,322
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we did watch Batman Begins again, and I sprained my wrist.

364
00:28:16,143 --> 00:28:18,984
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait a minute, how did you sprain your wrist watching Batman Begins?

365
00:28:19,004 --> 00:28:21,945
[SPEAKER_10]: I was drinking, and I got up off the floor.

366
00:28:25,326 --> 00:28:26,747
[SPEAKER_07]: Does Christian Bale do it for you?

367
00:28:28,688 --> 00:28:32,589
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, actually, in that movie, yeah.

368
00:28:32,649 --> 00:28:36,791
[SPEAKER_10]: I was getting up off the floor, and I pushed my hand down and hyperextended my wrist.

369
00:28:38,117 --> 00:28:39,358
[SPEAKER_07]: Were you going to show them the Batcave?

370
00:28:43,241 --> 00:28:51,047
[SPEAKER_10]: Listeners, I'm going to give you a play-by-play of me winding up this skin from Chipotle and throwing it at Robin, hitting him in the face, which I just did.

371
00:28:54,229 --> 00:28:55,810
[SPEAKER_10]: Naughty, naughty boy!

372
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:57,251
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but funny.

373
00:28:57,592 --> 00:28:58,592
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the important thing, funny.

374
00:28:59,573 --> 00:29:00,033
[SPEAKER_07]: I made it funny.

375
00:29:00,053 --> 00:29:01,875
[SPEAKER_07]: You're just pissed off because I made it funny at your expense.

376
00:29:03,256 --> 00:29:03,516
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

377
00:29:04,016 --> 00:29:04,937
[SPEAKER_07]: Bitch, you know I'm right.

378
00:29:05,778 --> 00:29:06,118
[SPEAKER_10]: Bitch?

379
00:29:06,438 --> 00:29:07,479
[SPEAKER_10]: Who do you call a bitch, bitch?

380
00:29:11,994 --> 00:29:15,435
[SPEAKER_10]: We were going to play Katamari last night, but we went out to TGR Fridays instead.

381
00:29:19,176 --> 00:29:21,657
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm so glad we have you on this video gaming station.

382
00:29:21,937 --> 00:29:22,217
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

383
00:29:23,977 --> 00:29:25,158
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to play a video game, but...

384
00:29:26,513 --> 00:29:27,333
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to go eat instead.

385
00:29:27,353 --> 00:29:29,174
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it was good.

386
00:29:29,494 --> 00:29:29,894
[SPEAKER_07]: It's fine.

387
00:29:30,014 --> 00:29:33,295
[SPEAKER_10]: And we ended up... Dan was watching The Job.

388
00:29:33,915 --> 00:29:34,855
[SPEAKER_10]: It has Dennis Leary.

389
00:29:35,756 --> 00:29:37,636
[SPEAKER_10]: I hate that show, but I love Dennis Leary.

390
00:29:38,836 --> 00:29:41,477
[SPEAKER_10]: I loathe just about every character on that show.

391
00:29:42,838 --> 00:29:46,639
[SPEAKER_10]: The last thing that I liked that I loathed every character on was Chicago.

392
00:29:47,639 --> 00:29:48,119
[SPEAKER_10]: But that's it.

393
00:29:48,719 --> 00:29:54,241
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, I'm done since you're not wasting all my time talking about stuff.

394
00:29:54,781 --> 00:29:55,361
[SPEAKER_07]: You know you love it.

395
00:29:56,394 --> 00:29:57,054
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what we do.

396
00:29:57,254 --> 00:29:57,515
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki.

397
00:29:57,595 --> 00:29:58,095
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, baby.

398
00:29:58,335 --> 00:29:58,995
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, how was your week?

399
00:29:59,015 --> 00:29:59,376
[SPEAKER_07]: How was your day?

400
00:30:00,616 --> 00:30:04,318
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, my week was weird, and my day was weird.

401
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:08,481
[SPEAKER_04]: The entire week was filled up with two things, and it's really strange.

402
00:30:09,241 --> 00:30:15,164
[SPEAKER_04]: Myself playing the game The Warriors and watching the first season of Desperate Housewives.

403
00:30:15,244 --> 00:30:20,547
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know how those two combined, but that's... I don't get it.

404
00:30:20,767 --> 00:30:23,489
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, you actually sat through the whole first season of Desperate Housewives?

405
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:24,890
[SPEAKER_04]: Not voluntarily.

406
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:27,011
[SPEAKER_04]: Nellie was watching Desperate Housewives.

407
00:30:27,191 --> 00:30:28,631
[SPEAKER_04]: I was programming the webpage.

408
00:30:29,852 --> 00:30:33,593
[SPEAKER_04]: In a sense, I did sit through the whole first season of Desperate Housewives.

409
00:30:36,514 --> 00:30:36,874
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

410
00:30:38,154 --> 00:30:39,075
[SPEAKER_10]: I have breaking news.

411
00:30:39,395 --> 00:30:39,575
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

412
00:30:39,675 --> 00:30:41,015
[SPEAKER_10]: I just found $2 in my pocket.

413
00:30:41,556 --> 00:30:42,656
[SPEAKER_07]: Congratulations.

414
00:30:43,416 --> 00:30:45,777
[SPEAKER_07]: That's your payment for doing this show for the past three and a half years.

415
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:50,011
[SPEAKER_10]: Dude, someone actually sent me a dollar.

416
00:30:50,812 --> 00:30:51,172
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

417
00:30:51,753 --> 00:30:54,535
[SPEAKER_10]: You know how in the intro it says, give her a dollar?

418
00:30:54,635 --> 00:30:54,975
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

419
00:30:55,055 --> 00:30:56,457
[SPEAKER_10]: Someone actually mailed me a dollar.

420
00:30:58,338 --> 00:31:00,240
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait, you gave somebody your address?

421
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:01,701
[SPEAKER_10]: It was somebody I knew anyway.

422
00:31:01,761 --> 00:31:02,141
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, okay.

423
00:31:02,161 --> 00:31:04,263
[SPEAKER_10]: He was listening to the show and he mailed me a dollar.

424
00:31:04,283 --> 00:31:05,024
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

425
00:31:06,225 --> 00:31:08,067
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, we're going to be rich doing this program.

426
00:31:08,967 --> 00:31:10,429
[SPEAKER_07]: Get all the listeners to send us a dollar.

427
00:31:10,489 --> 00:31:11,730
[SPEAKER_07]: Then we'd have like five dollars.

428
00:31:14,631 --> 00:31:15,192
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

429
00:31:35,779 --> 00:31:36,499
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all I have to say.

430
00:31:36,579 --> 00:31:36,980
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

431
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:41,882
[SPEAKER_04]: The whole scope of the show, they have one character at least that someone can identify with.

432
00:31:41,902 --> 00:31:44,823
[SPEAKER_04]: They have the four different type of women and stuff like that.

433
00:31:45,383 --> 00:31:47,184
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I don't know.

434
00:31:47,404 --> 00:31:49,465
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a bad show.

435
00:31:49,525 --> 00:31:56,828
[SPEAKER_04]: It's well written, I guess, but not exactly something that most heterosexual males would be caught dead watching.

436
00:31:59,109 --> 00:32:00,709
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

437
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:04,251
[SPEAKER_04]: For me, it had the same feel as Dead Like Me and Wonderfall's.

438
00:32:04,687 --> 00:32:32,687
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the same type of thing, where each show has like a theme to it, that type of thing Oh shit, Extra Pro, we're missing out, those two shows are great So, that's what it, I mean, I've got the DVD set, got it for free, thank God, I didn't pay for it So yeah, guess what is up next, I have to watch Season 1 of Lost now I really don't want to sit through that, so, but, whatever Anyways, so yeah, it's been that, working on the webpage, playing the Warriors And not getting to play any other games I wanted to play, because, you know, the TV is being taken up

439
00:32:33,692 --> 00:32:37,074
[SPEAKER_07]: So what did you do for the website?

440
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:46,558
[SPEAKER_04]: I created a wonderful kick-ass shout box for our PSP site with a nice virtual keyboard on there and everything.

441
00:32:46,638 --> 00:32:47,238
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks pretty.

442
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:53,681
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so you can go there and give us a shout out over on olrpsp.com.

443
00:32:54,022 --> 00:32:56,643
[SPEAKER_07]: But again, that website is really for viewing on your PSP.

444
00:32:56,863 --> 00:32:58,984
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll work in a normal browser, but it looks ugly.

445
00:32:59,935 --> 00:33:01,698
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't look as pretty, let's put it that way.

446
00:33:01,718 --> 00:33:05,604
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it is still pretty, but it's prettier if you look at it on PSP.

447
00:33:06,045 --> 00:33:07,266
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it's made for the PSP.

448
00:33:08,268 --> 00:33:10,912
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, it looks better than our regular website, I gotta say.

449
00:33:12,735 --> 00:33:13,015
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh well.

450
00:33:13,075 --> 00:33:13,396
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

451
00:33:13,777 --> 00:33:14,598
[SPEAKER_07]: That's alright, what can you do?

452
00:33:15,506 --> 00:33:18,388
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, that's pretty much what I've been doing this week.

453
00:33:19,089 --> 00:33:24,773
[SPEAKER_04]: Just lots of work and trying to put some video games in there.

454
00:33:25,394 --> 00:33:27,856
[SPEAKER_04]: Play Grand Theft Auto Liberty Stories for all five minutes.

455
00:33:28,516 --> 00:33:31,058
[SPEAKER_04]: That's about all the attention that I can dedicate to that game.

456
00:33:31,459 --> 00:33:32,099
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it that bad?

457
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:34,581
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I just can't dedicate enough attention to the game.

458
00:33:34,661 --> 00:33:35,782
[SPEAKER_07]: Too busy watching Desperate Housewives?

459
00:33:35,802 --> 00:33:38,604
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm too busy doing tons of stuff.

460
00:33:39,045 --> 00:33:39,365
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

461
00:33:40,034 --> 00:33:45,944
[SPEAKER_04]: Liberty City Stories, it's like, I don't even have time for most of the stuff on the PSP, so, I don't know.

462
00:33:47,386 --> 00:33:48,508
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be fun playing multiplayer, though.

463
00:33:48,528 --> 00:33:49,590
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, I'm done.

464
00:33:51,570 --> 00:33:54,612
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess I'll talk about my week real fast, then we'll get to our guests, and they can talk about their week.

465
00:33:56,273 --> 00:33:57,294
[SPEAKER_07]: My week was okay.

466
00:33:57,374 --> 00:34:02,898
[SPEAKER_07]: It was actually really busy, because I had an awful lot of work stuff this week, and I was even there one night until like 7 o'clock, and that's just sad.

467
00:34:04,379 --> 00:34:06,261
[SPEAKER_07]: So I haven't really gotten a chance to do a whole lot else.

468
00:34:06,281 --> 00:34:08,902
[SPEAKER_07]: I did buy some new games, and I'll talk about those on this week's podcast.

469
00:34:09,443 --> 00:34:11,624
[SPEAKER_07]: Soul Calibur III I've been playing an awful lot of, as well as...

470
00:34:13,125 --> 00:34:16,248
[SPEAKER_07]: Midway Arcade Treasures 3, which Loki gave me last week.

471
00:34:16,588 --> 00:34:22,152
[SPEAKER_07]: And I started playing Taito, but I'm going to save that for the week after podcast because I didn't get to play it really enough.

472
00:34:22,652 --> 00:34:24,213
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm going to talk about those games.

473
00:34:24,814 --> 00:34:27,676
[SPEAKER_07]: And not a whole lot else, really.

474
00:34:29,097 --> 00:34:40,345
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I didn't do a lot for Halloween, which is kind of, even though Halloween's technically tomorrow, I've really done a lot for Halloween, which is kind of too bad, except playing World of Warcraft and trick-or-treating inside of World of Warcraft, which is really nerdy.

475
00:34:40,985 --> 00:34:41,045
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

476
00:34:41,786 --> 00:34:42,267
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

477
00:34:58,684 --> 00:35:01,405
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's one of those towns where the college pretty much runs the town.

478
00:35:01,445 --> 00:35:05,647
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, like the keg is the national flower and stuff in Chico.

479
00:35:05,827 --> 00:35:07,928
[SPEAKER_07]: So it was good times, though.

480
00:35:08,048 --> 00:35:08,488
[SPEAKER_07]: Good times.

481
00:35:08,848 --> 00:35:10,169
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, just did a little bit of drinking.

482
00:35:10,329 --> 00:35:11,229
[SPEAKER_07]: Good times.

483
00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:13,911
[SPEAKER_07]: We drank butterbeer, like Harry Potter.

484
00:35:13,931 --> 00:35:14,891
[SPEAKER_07]: You know how they had the butterbeer?

485
00:35:15,371 --> 00:35:15,971
[SPEAKER_07]: We drank butterbeer.

486
00:35:15,991 --> 00:35:16,992
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what they put in butterbeer?

487
00:35:17,893 --> 00:35:18,413
[SPEAKER_08]: What is that?

488
00:35:18,473 --> 00:35:21,577
[SPEAKER_08]: Butterscotch schnapps, root beer, and vodka.

489
00:35:22,398 --> 00:35:31,909
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, when we went to the party last year, the one that Rice Princess threw, we had the butter beer there, and it was actually really good.

490
00:35:32,890 --> 00:35:36,775
[SPEAKER_08]: Everything there was really good, and then I got sick and put in the hospital the next day.

491
00:35:38,502 --> 00:35:40,344
[SPEAKER_08]: Xtifer had two major surgeries last year.

492
00:36:01,212 --> 00:36:02,873
[SPEAKER_08]: I did have two major surgeries last week.

493
00:36:02,893 --> 00:36:04,314
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe he didn't want me to say that on the show.

494
00:36:04,894 --> 00:36:08,696
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, no, it's okay to say that.

495
00:36:08,896 --> 00:36:09,596
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm fine with it.

496
00:36:10,617 --> 00:36:11,757
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm over it.

497
00:36:12,038 --> 00:36:13,018
[SPEAKER_08]: Extrovert's been cut up.

498
00:36:13,318 --> 00:36:15,980
[SPEAKER_08]: I have been cut up.

499
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:17,901
[SPEAKER_08]: Lost a gallbladder, lost an appendix.

500
00:36:18,001 --> 00:36:20,782
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm 10% less Christopher than you saw before that.

501
00:36:22,703 --> 00:36:24,444
[SPEAKER_08]: I have room in me to stuff things.

502
00:36:25,825 --> 00:36:26,585
[SPEAKER_07]: Good, you'll need that.

503
00:36:27,485 --> 00:36:28,586
[SPEAKER_08]: Like cocaine and stuff.

504
00:36:29,748 --> 00:36:30,408
[SPEAKER_08]: So is it my turn?

505
00:36:30,828 --> 00:36:31,489
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, how was your week?

506
00:36:31,509 --> 00:36:31,849
[SPEAKER_03]: How was your day?

507
00:36:32,049 --> 00:36:42,553
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, well, while Loki was getting in touch with his feminine side, I was, you know, doing my show on Monday, and I had a really good turnout.

508
00:36:43,273 --> 00:36:48,255
[SPEAKER_08]: Lots of listeners, 14 listeners, which was really good.

509
00:36:49,056 --> 00:36:54,638
[SPEAKER_08]: And I enjoyed it, and I can't wait to do it again tomorrow and stuff.

510
00:36:55,818 --> 00:36:59,401
[SPEAKER_08]: And also, I played an assload of World of Warcraft this week.

511
00:37:00,742 --> 00:37:01,322
[SPEAKER_08]: Addict.

512
00:37:01,563 --> 00:37:06,406
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, it's almost too sad to really talk about.

513
00:37:07,287 --> 00:37:13,792
[SPEAKER_08]: Yesterday, I went to a movie, which I guess I'll get to later on in the show.

514
00:37:14,573 --> 00:37:18,416
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's just say I saw a movie with my sister.

515
00:37:18,716 --> 00:37:20,978
[SPEAKER_08]: My sister saw it, too!

516
00:37:23,504 --> 00:37:25,326
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay?

517
00:37:26,287 --> 00:37:31,192
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you may want to look forward to my movie review later on.

518
00:37:31,572 --> 00:37:33,754
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll be spectabulous.

519
00:37:36,637 --> 00:37:36,917
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

520
00:37:37,097 --> 00:37:38,459
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, it'll be tabulous.

521
00:37:38,819 --> 00:37:39,640
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, tab.

522
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:40,661
[SPEAKER_07]: Give the microphone to Angel.

523
00:37:40,821 --> 00:37:41,021
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

524
00:37:41,341 --> 00:37:41,742
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

525
00:37:42,082 --> 00:37:42,823
[SPEAKER_07]: Angel, how was your week?

526
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:43,283
[SPEAKER_07]: How was your day?

527
00:37:43,363 --> 00:37:43,784
[SPEAKER_10]: Mine?

528
00:37:43,984 --> 00:37:46,386
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, pretty good.

529
00:37:48,038 --> 00:37:51,721
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for watching, and I'll see you next time.

530
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:05,260
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh-huh?

531
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:10,045
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie allows yourself to get tied up with chatting with our chatters at OrangeLiveJournal.com.

532
00:38:10,485 --> 00:38:13,408
[SPEAKER_10]: I really want my friends to listen to LiveJournal.

533
00:38:13,849 --> 00:38:16,111
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, I really don't want to know what that is.

534
00:38:16,191 --> 00:38:17,312
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you paste that in chat?

535
00:38:17,592 --> 00:38:18,013
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I did.

536
00:38:18,073 --> 00:38:21,156
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a birthday cake with a giant cock on it, basically.

537
00:38:21,176 --> 00:38:22,878
[SPEAKER_07]: And it has piercings with a cock ring.

538
00:38:22,898 --> 00:38:24,439
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not talking about a chicken.

539
00:38:28,523 --> 00:38:30,905
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice that she did that right when I have the mic.

540
00:38:30,925 --> 00:38:31,705
[SPEAKER_08]: It's balls look horrible.

541
00:38:32,105 --> 00:38:33,827
[SPEAKER_10]: That's not fair!

542
00:38:33,847 --> 00:38:37,169
[SPEAKER_08]: It's balls look diseased or something.

543
00:38:37,949 --> 00:38:39,470
[SPEAKER_08]: The balls look like kushes.

544
00:38:40,291 --> 00:38:41,011
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, seriously.

545
00:38:41,031 --> 00:38:42,232
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, Abel, please continue.

546
00:38:42,252 --> 00:38:43,052
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry, Abel.

547
00:38:44,313 --> 00:38:45,334
[SPEAKER_10]: Now I forgot what I was saying.

548
00:38:45,834 --> 00:38:46,254
[SPEAKER_10]: Damn it.

549
00:38:46,855 --> 00:38:47,235
[SPEAKER_10]: Damn it.

550
00:38:47,415 --> 00:38:47,695
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

551
00:38:48,876 --> 00:38:49,416
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, yeah.

552
00:38:49,777 --> 00:38:55,600
[SPEAKER_10]: I had a lot of school stuff to do, but then other than that, it was pretty much gearing up for BlizzCon, even though I didn't really go, but I...

553
00:38:56,761 --> 00:38:57,722
[SPEAKER_10]: Know a lot of stuff now.

554
00:38:58,462 --> 00:38:59,103
[SPEAKER_10]: After the fact.

555
00:39:00,063 --> 00:39:01,484
[SPEAKER_10]: We can get to that later if you wish.

556
00:39:01,564 --> 00:39:01,864
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure.

557
00:39:02,064 --> 00:39:04,766
[SPEAKER_10]: Considering there's a lot of stuff to talk about.

558
00:39:06,847 --> 00:39:08,468
[SPEAKER_10]: I played a lot of World of Warcraft.

559
00:39:08,528 --> 00:39:11,910
[SPEAKER_10]: I shouldn't have, but I did and it was fun.

560
00:39:12,071 --> 00:39:14,732
[SPEAKER_10]: All the cool kids play World of Warcraft now.

561
00:39:14,992 --> 00:39:16,173
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to pull an extrovert here.

562
00:39:16,493 --> 00:39:23,718
[SPEAKER_07]: When we talk about World of Warcraft, the fact that we're going to be bringing it up, it might have your ears burning.

563
00:39:25,819 --> 00:39:29,827
[SPEAKER_07]: and then we'll be on a crusade later to tell you all the latest information.

564
00:39:32,569 --> 00:39:35,250
[SPEAKER_08]: I bet it was interesting to see.

565
00:39:35,730 --> 00:39:37,890
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh wait, I mean, oh, never mind.

566
00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:39,150
[SPEAKER_08]: Shut up.

567
00:39:39,951 --> 00:39:40,411
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, Angel.

568
00:39:41,031 --> 00:40:00,515
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, and not that I ever talk about that other game called There, but I kind of got nominated for this big council thing where you work with staff and you work with 15 other people and I get to find out tomorrow if I...

569
00:40:01,331 --> 00:40:02,312

[SPEAKER_10]: What?

572
00:41:01,719 --> 00:41:03,861
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I thought you were going to say that was a horrible laugh angel.

573
00:41:03,941 --> 00:41:04,221
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway.

574
00:41:05,482 --> 00:41:06,162
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that too.

575
00:41:06,563 --> 00:41:07,283
[SPEAKER_10]: Shut up.

576
00:41:08,224 --> 00:41:08,864
[SPEAKER_10]: Shut up.

577
00:41:09,144 --> 00:41:09,445
[SPEAKER_10]: Woo.

578
00:41:09,465 --> 00:41:10,385
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

579
00:41:11,026 --> 00:41:13,688
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I love how our show gets visual at some points.

580
00:41:14,008 --> 00:41:14,728
[SPEAKER_07]: Great radio, gang.

581
00:41:15,129 --> 00:41:15,629
[SPEAKER_07]: Great radio.

582
00:41:16,029 --> 00:41:16,590
[SPEAKER_10]: Website again.

583
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:18,391
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway.

584
00:41:19,572 --> 00:41:21,033
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it, I guess.

585
00:41:22,254 --> 00:41:22,594
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, bye.

586
00:41:23,803 --> 00:41:29,867
[SPEAKER_08]: We should have a show or something where we just watch a movie and all it is is just our reactions to it.

587
00:41:30,448 --> 00:41:33,190
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, oh my god, what'd you do?

588
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:34,610
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god, take that out!

589
00:41:34,711 --> 00:41:35,991
[SPEAKER_08]: Take that out!

590
00:41:36,011 --> 00:41:37,512
[SPEAKER_08]: Do not go back there!

591
00:41:37,673 --> 00:41:39,694
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god, not in the Batcave!

592
00:41:40,134 --> 00:41:41,115
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh no, no!

593
00:41:42,996 --> 00:41:44,557
[SPEAKER_10]: And then make all my bodies to jump!

594
00:41:46,178 --> 00:41:47,159
[SPEAKER_10]: Not in the back door!

595
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:48,340
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't go in the back door!

596
00:41:51,997 --> 00:41:53,358
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god, she's been backdoored!

597
00:41:58,942 --> 00:41:59,603
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, anyway.

598
00:42:00,844 --> 00:42:02,345
[SPEAKER_07]: I think this show's in need of a break.

599
00:42:02,445 --> 00:42:05,547
[SPEAKER_07]: And when we come back from this break, we're going to talk about some actual video game related things.

600
00:42:06,068 --> 00:42:08,790
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to talk about Ultramix 3, because there's a whole shitload of news on Ultramix 3.

601
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:13,053
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we're going to talk a little bit about the Burning Crusade.

602
00:42:14,033 --> 00:42:14,754
[SPEAKER_17]: Hot.

603
00:42:15,194 --> 00:42:19,518
[SPEAKER_07]: Because now that we've all become World of Warcraft whores, we have to dedicate a little piece of our show to that.

604
00:42:19,738 --> 00:42:20,178
[SPEAKER_10]: Hot.

605
00:42:20,698 --> 00:42:21,059
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

606
00:42:22,813 --> 00:42:25,154
[SPEAKER_07]: Sky, DarkSakura, and Loki

607
00:42:51,329 --> 00:42:52,930

[SPEAKER_07]: God, I'm old.

619
00:50:53,612 --> 00:50:54,112
[SPEAKER_10]: No, just kidding.

620
00:50:54,252 --> 00:50:55,353
[SPEAKER_10]: Not counting the half shows.

[SPEAKER_07]: You've been here since what?

626
00:51:04,705 --> 00:51:04,545
37.

627
00:51:04,725 --> 00:51:06,926
[SPEAKER_07]: 37?

628
00:51:04,825 --> 00:51:06,926
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought it was 27.

629
00:51:07,046 --> 00:51:07,306
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

630
00:51:07,846 --> 00:51:08,366

00:51:09,946 --> 00:51:11,107
[SPEAKER_07]: A long time.

633
00:51:11,427 --> 00:51:11,107
27.

634
00:51:11,987 --> 00:51:12,307
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.

635
00:51:13,007 --> 00:51:16,808
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, again, ever since, you know, God, when did we start doing the podcast?

636
00:51:16,968 --> 00:51:20,929
[SPEAKER_07]: It was January of this year, so it was like around 110 or so in show numbers.

637
00:51:21,529 --> 00:51:22,429
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I just, no, not that.

638
00:51:22,489 --> 00:51:23,870
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess it would be sooner than that, about 120, 130.

639
00:51:24,190 --> 00:51:27,391
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, it was when we really started getting a lot of new people.

640
00:51:27,431 --> 00:51:28,011
[SPEAKER_07]: Gee, I wonder why.

641
00:51:28,551 --> 00:51:28,631
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh...

642
00:51:28,971 --> 00:51:29,932
[SPEAKER_19]: www.DarkSakura.com

643
00:51:50,194 --> 00:52:08,523
[SPEAKER_07]: And also, we just announced this last week, so some of you guys might have missed this, but now, not only can you call in over the Skype line by calling our username at Orange Lounge Radio, but you can actually call us on the phone, 916-226-9067 is the Orange Lounge Radio number, so you'll be able to call in to that very soon.

644
00:52:08,903 --> 00:52:09,623
[SPEAKER_07]: So, very cool.

645
00:52:10,183 --> 00:52:11,604
[SPEAKER_07]: You missed that, Jamie, that was last week.

646
00:52:11,644 --> 00:52:13,305
[SPEAKER_07]: We have an actual number now.

647
00:52:14,766 --> 00:52:21,411
[SPEAKER_07]: So we can get even more people calling in and telling us to go fuck ourselves.

648
00:52:22,052 --> 00:52:23,954
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, 916-226-9067.

649
00:52:24,915 --> 00:52:25,995
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't call yet, we're not answering.

650
00:52:28,638 --> 00:52:32,501
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see, we also have our chat room going on, www.orangeentrader.com.

651
00:52:32,541 --> 00:52:39,467
[SPEAKER_07]: Click on chat and you can see all these folks chatting, including Dirty Thief, who keeps wanting to get me to say his name.

652
00:52:39,867 --> 00:52:40,468
[SPEAKER_07]: So there you have it.

653
00:52:41,229 --> 00:52:41,609
[SPEAKER_07]: I said it.

654
00:52:44,294 --> 00:52:54,586
[SPEAKER_07]: Dan's Dance Revolution Ultra Mix 3 is on its way out and they've been taking it out on tour.

655
00:52:54,646 --> 00:52:59,811
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if you guys heard about the Konami tour, but Konami's going around and touring the nation right now.

656
00:53:00,492 --> 00:53:03,235
[SPEAKER_07]: And when I say nation, I mean a couple of select states.

657
00:53:04,376 --> 00:53:10,738
[SPEAKER_07]: They already did the ones in California, but neglected to tell anybody that it was going on in the DDR community, so none of us thought to go out.

658
00:53:11,318 --> 00:53:14,819
[SPEAKER_07]: But it was in Southern California anyway, so we here at OLR wouldn't have been able to go.

659
00:53:15,219 --> 00:53:22,661
[SPEAKER_07]: But right now, this past weekend, they have been in Texas, and they were in Texas today, and that's the last opportunity to catch them in Texas.

660
00:53:23,222 --> 00:53:27,003
[SPEAKER_07]: However, they're going to go to Illinois over November 4th, 5th, and 6th.

661
00:53:28,764 --> 00:53:31,767
[SPEAKER_07]: And then they'll be in Massachusetts, 11th, 12th, and 13th.

662
00:53:32,107 --> 00:53:38,614
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the New York, New Jersey area, mostly New Jersey, 18th, 19th, and 20th of November.

663
00:53:38,894 --> 00:53:43,199
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you want to check out the exact locations, we've got them posted on our site, OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

664
00:53:43,239 --> 00:53:45,521
[SPEAKER_07]: Just look for the little story about the mall tour and click read more.

665
00:53:45,922 --> 00:53:50,827
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, because of the mall tour, people have been getting to play final builds of the game.

666
00:53:52,407 --> 00:53:55,068
[SPEAKER_07]: and came back to report a song list.

667
00:53:55,088 --> 00:53:59,030
[SPEAKER_07]: The song list is also posted on our website, www.orangezonesradio.com.

668
00:53:59,890 --> 00:54:02,171
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess I'll go ahead and read through the song list here.

669
00:54:02,632 --> 00:54:16,538
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, people have put together, based on the song names, because what somebody did on DDR Freak is they went to the tour and just wrote down all the names, but they neglected to write down all the artists, so they've kind of just been piecing it together, which artists go with which songs.

670
00:54:17,598 --> 00:54:19,459
[SPEAKER_07]: So we know about Akumajou Dracula Medley.

671
00:54:20,139 --> 00:54:25,801
[SPEAKER_07]: This group, Blackalicious, has a song called Alphabet Aerobics, which should be very interesting.

672
00:54:25,901 --> 00:54:28,421
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I actually might have a copy of it on my machine somewhere.

673
00:54:28,441 --> 00:54:30,382
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to have to take a look.

[SPEAKER_07]: No FX with Bath of Least Resistance.

679
00:54:43,926 --> 00:54:45,387
[SPEAKER_10]: That's going to be interesting.

00:54:45,407 --> 00:54:45,707
[SPEAKER_07]: No FX.

681
00:54:46,047 --> 00:54:46,687

[SPEAKER_10]: No, I went to Red Lobster Friday.

748
01:00:07,891 --> 01:00:08,791
[SPEAKER_03]: Red Lobster.

749
01:00:09,111 --> 01:00:10,191
[SPEAKER_10]: I vote for Rock Lobster.

750
01:00:10,611 --> 01:00:13,912
[SPEAKER_10]: I ate Rock Lobster, which are really giant crayfish.

751
01:00:14,815 --> 01:00:16,778
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's get some clips of some of these songs, shall we?

752
01:00:17,519 --> 01:00:20,543
[SPEAKER_07]: I know I have Sold It For A Song by Zonk, so we're going to play a little clip of this.

753
01:00:20,583 --> 01:00:22,685
[SPEAKER_07]: This is something you're going to be hearing in DDR Ultramix 3.

754
01:00:22,765 --> 01:00:23,787
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's a little clip.

755
01:00:23,807 --> 01:00:25,249
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Sold It For A Song by Zonk.

756
01:01:59,497 --> 01:02:00,918
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow, I have to interrupt this.

757
01:02:00,938 --> 01:02:02,520
[SPEAKER_07]: We're playing some clips from Ultimax 3 songs.

758
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:05,282
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to interrupt this to say that we hit our cap tonight, you guys.

759
01:02:05,462 --> 01:02:11,647
[SPEAKER_07]: We have the maximum number of people on stream that we're supposed to be able to hold right now for what we're paying for at Live 365.

760
01:02:11,707 --> 01:02:15,370
[SPEAKER_07]: So, shit, we're going to have to pay more to fit 100 people on stuff now.

761
01:02:15,410 --> 01:02:16,211
[SPEAKER_07]: So, anyway.

762
01:02:17,898 --> 01:02:18,398
[SPEAKER_07]: Good job, you guys.

763
01:02:18,418 --> 01:02:19,759
[SPEAKER_10]: That's where we put up the PayPal link.

764
01:02:19,879 --> 01:02:20,119
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

765
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:22,400
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we're going to have to put up the PayPal link now.

766
01:02:22,901 --> 01:02:25,002
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you guys for listening and making us successful.

767
01:02:25,042 --> 01:02:30,325
[SPEAKER_07]: If you are on the stream right now, don't disconnect because there are people in the chat room that are pissed that they can't get in.

768
01:02:30,705 --> 01:02:33,627
[SPEAKER_07]: So, we'll see.

769
01:02:33,707 --> 01:02:35,208
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, let's go to another clip.

770
01:02:35,228 --> 01:02:37,169
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a clip of, we played this on the show before.

771
01:02:37,189 --> 01:02:38,169
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to play this for you guys again.

772
01:02:38,429 --> 01:02:39,550
[SPEAKER_07]: Midi Head with Raise Your Hands.

773
01:02:53,704 --> 01:02:54,610
Thank you for watching!

774
01:03:55,871 --> 01:03:56,851
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, let's do another clip.

775
01:03:56,871 --> 01:04:01,874
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a song by Real Life called Imperfection, which is one that we named off.

776
01:04:01,914 --> 01:04:02,694
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be in DDR.

777
01:04:03,854 --> 01:04:11,117
This is my imperfection Waiting for your direction

778
01:04:43,601 --> 01:04:50,045
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm never coming down again I'm never coming down I'm in love and love is what I like

779
01:05:11,411 --> 01:05:17,158
[SPEAKER_13]: We look for your direction This is my imperfection We look for resurrection

780
01:05:57,594 --> 01:06:01,015
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, that was another clip of a song that's going to be in Ultramix 3, Real Life with Imperfection.

781
01:06:01,175 --> 01:06:03,736
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't find Istanbul.

782
01:06:03,956 --> 01:06:06,397
[SPEAKER_07]: I know I had that song years ago, so I'm going to have to get that.

783
01:06:06,437 --> 01:06:10,738
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll play some more clips on some later shows before the game gets out, so check it out.

784
01:06:10,978 --> 01:06:12,959
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you guys think of this Ultramix 3 song list?

785
01:06:12,979 --> 01:06:14,439
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm curious to hear your feedback.

786
01:06:14,819 --> 01:06:15,299
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura?

787
01:06:15,700 --> 01:06:16,700
[SPEAKER_10]: Not quite so generic.

788
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:18,941
[SPEAKER_07]: It's very diverse, isn't it?

789
01:06:19,421 --> 01:06:23,222
[SPEAKER_07]: They're definitely going for a very diverse listing, aren't they?

790
01:06:23,797 --> 01:06:25,098
[SPEAKER_10]: It is very diverse.

791
01:06:25,198 --> 01:06:28,019
[SPEAKER_10]: I like the system that they're so diverse.

792
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:33,823
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, frickin' Ray Charles and Noah FX in the same mix.

793
01:06:33,843 --> 01:06:34,443
[SPEAKER_07]: That's crazy.

794
01:06:34,663 --> 01:06:35,383
[SPEAKER_10]: That's pretty cute.

795
01:06:36,484 --> 01:06:37,124
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you think, Loki?

796
01:06:38,505 --> 01:06:39,506
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, it's pretty cool.

797
01:06:39,686 --> 01:06:43,788
[SPEAKER_04]: I just don't have an Xbox, so... Well, you have the 360, though, right?

798
01:06:43,808 --> 01:06:46,350
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it doesn't mean it's gonna work on it.

799
01:06:48,087 --> 01:06:50,948
[SPEAKER_04]: Angel, what do you think of the Ultimix 3 songs there?

800
01:07:15,757 --> 01:07:17,158
[SPEAKER_10]: Like you said, pretty diverse.

801
01:07:18,119 --> 01:07:19,060
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I'm looking forward to it.

802
01:07:19,100 --> 01:07:19,901
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see what happens.

803
01:07:31,106 --> 01:07:40,709
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, one other thing I want to point out about Ultramix 3 is that also what's been revealed in the demo is that they're going to have a .5 speed.

804
01:07:41,189 --> 01:07:43,590
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's like it's going to be able to slow down the arrows.

805
01:07:43,610 --> 01:07:46,351
[SPEAKER_07]: So those of you guys that say, Max 300 is too fast.

806
01:07:46,371 --> 01:07:48,251
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, now you'll have a .5 modifier.

807
01:07:48,631 --> 01:07:49,732
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's going to be very interesting.

808
01:07:51,512 --> 01:07:55,013
[SPEAKER_07]: And also, if you can play bag on .5, that would be very impressive.

809
01:07:57,314 --> 01:08:00,455
[SPEAKER_07]: I know it's been done like on, excuse me,

810
01:08:02,256 --> 01:08:08,097
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that that stuff's been done on StepMania and stuff, but it's nice to see it acknowledged in real DDR.

811
01:08:12,899 --> 01:08:15,859
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, what arcade mix had the .5 on it?

812
01:08:15,899 --> 01:08:17,780
[SPEAKER_07]: Wasn't there one of the bootlegs or something?

813
01:08:17,940 --> 01:08:26,902
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone hacked Extreme with the .5 speed and the wave and break.

814
01:08:27,779 --> 01:08:29,140
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio

815
01:08:57,523 --> 01:08:58,004
[SPEAKER_27]: Hey, what's up?

816
01:08:58,064 --> 01:08:58,604
[SPEAKER_27]: It's Ranma.

817
01:08:58,925 --> 01:08:59,846
[SPEAKER_27]: Hey, Ranma, how are you?

818
01:09:00,166 --> 01:09:01,788
[SPEAKER_27]: Ranma!

819
01:09:02,468 --> 01:09:02,749
[SPEAKER_27]: What?

820
01:09:02,889 --> 01:09:04,130
[SPEAKER_27]: Hey, Jamie, what's up?

821
01:09:05,952 --> 01:09:07,955
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, this is the ultimate test of the message, Mark.

822
01:09:08,055 --> 01:09:10,337
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm currently on the road as we speak.

823
01:09:10,597 --> 01:09:11,839
[SPEAKER_07]: You're currently on the road?

824
01:09:13,072 --> 01:09:14,834
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, I'm coming back to my niece's house.

825
01:09:14,914 --> 01:09:16,176
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm on the bus heading back home.

826
01:09:31,550 --> 01:09:37,492
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, I'm not too worried about it, because when I did host somebody in the chatroom, it was actually taped in the show, so I'll definitely get a copy.

827
01:09:37,572 --> 01:09:42,214
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I heard about our bootleggers we got going on, so that's cool.

828
01:09:42,474 --> 01:09:43,094
[SPEAKER_07]: It's flattering.

829
01:09:43,334 --> 01:09:43,855
[SPEAKER_07]: Who said hey?

830
01:09:44,155 --> 01:09:47,096
[SPEAKER_27]: I call it syndication underground.

831
01:09:47,516 --> 01:09:47,956
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, okay.

832
01:09:48,256 --> 01:09:48,756
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all good.

833
01:09:48,896 --> 01:09:49,297
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all good.

834
01:09:49,557 --> 01:09:53,458
[SPEAKER_07]: We can't officially support it because of the licensed music issue, but yeah.

835
01:09:53,658 --> 01:09:54,659
[SPEAKER_10]: We're underground.

836
01:09:54,699 --> 01:09:55,499
[SPEAKER_10]: That's cool.

837
01:09:57,820 --> 01:09:58,080
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

838
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:00,921
[SPEAKER_27]: First of all, happy Halloween to you guys.

839
01:10:01,300 --> 01:10:01,961
[SPEAKER_07]: Happy Halloween.

840
01:10:01,981 --> 01:10:02,982
[SPEAKER_07]: What are you doing for your Halloween?

841
01:10:04,463 --> 01:10:10,548
[SPEAKER_27]: We're going to hang out tomorrow dressed as Naruto characters and just go enter the parade in downtown Manhattan.

842
01:10:10,969 --> 01:10:11,609
[SPEAKER_07]: Nerds.

843
01:10:12,350 --> 01:10:12,870
[SPEAKER_07]: No, that's cool.

844
01:10:13,051 --> 01:10:13,971
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, right we are.

845
01:10:14,532 --> 01:10:16,333
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm wearing big black wings tomorrow.

846
01:10:16,994 --> 01:10:17,675
[SPEAKER_10]: They're feathery.

847
01:10:19,316 --> 01:10:21,458
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to go around reaping my fellow co-workers.

848
01:10:22,859 --> 01:10:23,100
[SPEAKER_27]: Uh-oh.

849
01:10:25,339 --> 01:10:28,642
[SPEAKER_27]: and last night we had a Halloween party out in Queensland.

850
01:10:28,702 --> 01:10:34,266
[SPEAKER_27]: Let's just say everybody got trashed and let's just say it boils down to this.

851
01:10:34,726 --> 01:10:38,229
[SPEAKER_27]: Whatever happens at a Halloween party stays at a Halloween party.

852
01:10:39,430 --> 01:10:40,071
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh.

853
01:10:40,351 --> 01:10:42,052
[SPEAKER_27]: You have to be there to understand.

854
01:10:42,212 --> 01:10:43,213
[SPEAKER_27]: Let's see about some of that.

855
01:10:43,273 --> 01:10:44,674
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, good watching.

856
01:10:45,115 --> 01:10:45,955
[SPEAKER_07]: One of those things.

857
01:10:46,075 --> 01:10:51,580
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we've got to kind of keep it short tonight because we've got a ton of people trying to get in, but anything else you want to say?

858
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:51,900
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got to.

01:11:31,363 --> 01:11:33,324
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, Nintendomaniac64, why are you pissed?

869
01:11:37,150 --> 01:11:41,010
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what to say.

870
01:11:41,050 --> 01:11:42,631
[SPEAKER_07]: We've never been in this situation before.

871
01:11:43,011 --> 01:11:44,951
[SPEAKER_07]: One other time we were in this situation.

872
01:11:45,271 --> 01:11:48,052
[SPEAKER_07]: We've been on the air for three and a half years now.

873
01:11:48,132 --> 01:11:49,212
[SPEAKER_07]: Literally three and a half years.

874
01:11:49,652 --> 01:11:52,873
[SPEAKER_07]: And we've only one other time been this popular.

875
01:11:52,913 --> 01:11:56,174
[SPEAKER_07]: And the only reason we had so many people trying to get in that episode...

876
01:11:56,374 --> 01:11:56,874
[SPEAKER_07]: People get pissed.

877
01:11:56,954 --> 01:11:57,495
[SPEAKER_07]: People get pissed.

878
01:12:25,939 --> 01:12:27,040
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'm sorry.

879
01:12:27,340 --> 01:12:31,623
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to look at what we can do about increasing the cap so we can get more listeners in during the show.

880
01:12:31,683 --> 01:12:35,446
[SPEAKER_07]: But for tonight, you guys are a little bit screwed.

881
01:12:35,766 --> 01:12:36,567
[SPEAKER_07]: But you know what?

882
01:12:36,627 --> 01:12:38,989
[SPEAKER_07]: Go into our chat room at orangelaunchradio.com and click on chat.

883
01:12:39,109 --> 01:12:46,674
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's people that can help you catch up on what you missed, so to speak, if you know what I mean.

884
01:12:46,714 --> 01:12:46,955
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

885
01:12:47,055 --> 01:12:47,935
[SPEAKER_07]: Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.

886
01:12:49,697 --> 01:12:49,897
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah.

887
01:12:50,277 --> 01:12:51,378
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

888
01:12:51,418 --> 01:12:54,100
[SPEAKER_07]: Anything you want to say gaming related or related to the show?

889
01:12:55,478 --> 01:12:57,459
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, uh, you said you got Midway Arcade Treasures 3?

890
01:12:57,499 --> 01:13:00,620
[SPEAKER_24]: Uh, run that by me one more time, you broke up a little bit there?

891
01:13:02,441 --> 01:13:04,602
[SPEAKER_24]: You said you got Midway Arcade Treasures 3?

892
01:13:05,063 --> 01:13:06,403
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I got Midway Arcade Treasures 3.

893
01:13:08,444 --> 01:13:11,686
[SPEAKER_07]: Cool, I've been trying, like, forever to get that game.

894
01:13:12,346 --> 01:13:19,670
[SPEAKER_07]: Really, it's not, I, I got it thanks to Loki, so I didn't try to go out and buy it in the store or anything, so, I guess I got kinda lucky.

895
01:13:20,010 --> 01:13:22,631
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, not like, not trying forever, but I mean, like,

896
01:13:24,026 --> 01:13:24,927
[SPEAKER_25]: I can't drive yet.

897
01:13:44,962 --> 01:13:51,086
[SPEAKER_07]: Midway Arcade Treasures 3, of course, is the eight driving games kind of all put in one game.

898
01:13:52,527 --> 01:14:00,413
[SPEAKER_07]: Classics like Hydro Thunder and Stun Runner and my favorite, Iron Man Off-Road with the track pack as well, which I think is awesome.

899
01:14:00,793 --> 01:14:02,274
[SPEAKER_07]: So anyway, let's go to another call.

900
01:14:02,334 --> 01:14:04,536
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go to this one.

901
01:14:05,076 --> 01:14:05,977
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

902
01:14:08,879 --> 01:14:10,440
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

903
01:14:11,841 --> 01:14:12,501
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello.

904
01:14:12,802 --> 01:14:13,062
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello.

905
01:14:14,178 --> 01:14:14,398
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi.

906
01:14:14,418 --> 01:14:15,519
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, who's this?

907
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:17,420
[SPEAKER_11]: This is Roz again.

908
01:14:17,540 --> 01:14:18,221
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, Roz.

909
01:14:18,241 --> 01:14:18,721
[SPEAKER_07]: How are you?

910
01:14:18,821 --> 01:14:19,342
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, Roz.

911
01:14:20,402 --> 01:14:20,923
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi.

912
01:14:22,064 --> 01:14:22,384
[SPEAKER_07]: What's up?

913
01:14:22,404 --> 01:14:22,964
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm pretty good.

914
01:14:23,104 --> 01:14:29,029
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, I feel really damn great because I had my first ever Red Bull today.

915
01:14:30,230 --> 01:14:30,550
What?

916
01:14:31,130 --> 01:14:32,391
[SPEAKER_07]: She had her first Red Bull today.

917
01:14:32,731 --> 01:14:33,572
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, shit.

918
01:14:34,891 --> 01:14:35,832
[SPEAKER_07]: Red Bull is the color of pee.

919
01:14:52,543 --> 01:14:52,843
[SPEAKER_11]: It is.

920
01:14:52,983 --> 01:14:54,845
[SPEAKER_11]: It really looks a lot like it.

921
01:14:55,445 --> 01:15:00,428
[SPEAKER_11]: That's why it's in a can, not a clear bottle.

922
01:15:00,668 --> 01:15:02,369
[SPEAKER_07]: So why are you drinking Red Bull tonight?

923
01:15:02,390 --> 01:15:04,631
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you just drinking it for recreational purposes?

924
01:15:06,352 --> 01:15:13,697
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I had never had one before, and I was going to get bottled water, but they were out of it for some reason, like at the little store place I was at.

925
01:15:14,614 --> 01:15:18,436
[SPEAKER_11]: So the other thing that they had that was like cold was Red Bull.

926
01:15:18,816 --> 01:15:22,298
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just picked one out and decided to drink it today.

927
01:15:23,318 --> 01:15:24,199
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel great.

928
01:15:25,960 --> 01:15:27,981
[SPEAKER_07]: You kind of sound like you're really happy.

929
01:15:30,242 --> 01:15:30,902
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just messing with you.

930
01:15:30,922 --> 01:15:32,063
[SPEAKER_10]: That's great.

931
01:15:32,883 --> 01:15:35,284
[SPEAKER_10]: Red Bull gives you wings because it makes you freaking high.

932
01:15:38,346 --> 01:15:39,026
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, exactly.

933
01:15:39,487 --> 01:15:39,807
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

934
01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:44,203
[SPEAKER_07]: So anything you want to share about what you've been hearing on the show so far?

935
01:15:44,264 --> 01:15:45,866
[SPEAKER_07]: Anything going on in your video game world?

936
01:15:52,848 --> 01:15:54,188
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah, the Katamari cake.

937
01:15:54,308 --> 01:15:58,850
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, what is up with all these cakes you guys are looking at tonight in chat?

938
01:15:59,070 --> 01:16:06,451
[SPEAKER_07]: So there was the cake with the giant penis on it, and now there's the cake that's a Katamari, the little prince of the cosmos pushing around the Katamari.

939
01:16:06,471 --> 01:16:06,871
[SPEAKER_07]: That's awesome.

940
01:16:06,891 --> 01:16:08,312
[SPEAKER_10]: I want a cake like that for my birthday.

941
01:16:09,172 --> 01:16:11,313
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, like two years ago I had a Kirby cake.

942
01:16:13,393 --> 01:16:14,673
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's so cute.

943
01:16:14,813 --> 01:16:16,194
[SPEAKER_07]: What was Kirby doing on the Kirby cake?

944
01:16:17,194 --> 01:16:19,115
[SPEAKER_11]: He was just kind of being there.

945
01:16:19,415 --> 01:16:20,955
[SPEAKER_07]: Just chilling out, saying, hey, I'm a cake.

946
01:16:21,693 --> 01:16:22,254
[SPEAKER_11]: In the fridge.

947
01:16:22,614 --> 01:16:26,577
[SPEAKER_11]: And I couldn't look in the fridge for like two days because it was supposed to be a surprise.

948
01:16:26,858 --> 01:16:27,198
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

949
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:37,007
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, so I would be like making eggs and I'd have to shut my eyes and I'd end up like sticking my hand in mashed potatoes or something.

950
01:16:37,047 --> 01:16:38,628
[SPEAKER_07]: What flavor was Kirby when you ate him?

951
01:16:39,949 --> 01:16:40,390
[SPEAKER_11]: Strawberry.

952
01:16:41,050 --> 01:16:41,371
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

953
01:16:41,991 --> 01:16:43,012
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a very Kirby flavor.

954
01:16:43,212 --> 01:16:44,453
[SPEAKER_11]: Kirby is strawberry.

955
01:16:45,274 --> 01:16:45,715
[SPEAKER_07]: Delicious.

956
01:16:46,516 --> 01:16:52,221
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Roz, we're going to go ahead and let you go so we can get to another caller, but thanks so much for calling in and sharing the Kirby cake love with us.

957
01:16:52,521 --> 01:16:56,064
[SPEAKER_07]: And enjoy that Red Bull, but please, don't drink and drive, alright?

958
01:16:57,125 --> 01:16:57,465
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

959
01:16:57,565 --> 01:16:58,466
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, have a good one.

960
01:16:59,407 --> 01:16:59,707
[SPEAKER_11]: Bye.

961
01:16:59,767 --> 01:17:01,368
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I also want to say, Roz, Roz, wait.

962
01:17:01,388 --> 01:17:03,090
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually talked while the girl was here.

963
01:17:03,931 --> 01:17:05,812
[SPEAKER_07]: Roz, I just want to say real quick, one more thing.

964
01:17:07,133 --> 01:17:08,955
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you drink liquor at all, ever?

965
01:17:11,324 --> 01:17:16,688
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to be responsible for starting someone's drinking career, so stay away from the absolute for tonight.

966
01:17:40,879 --> 01:17:46,509
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go to another call Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio Hey Hey, who's this?

967
01:17:47,351 --> 01:17:51,758
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Xander from Florida again Hi, Xander from Florida Aren't you one of our listeners who's shut out right now?

968
01:17:53,240 --> 01:17:53,480
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

969
01:17:53,880 --> 01:17:56,321
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I'm so sorry to hear it, but I don't know what to tell you.

970
01:17:56,361 --> 01:17:57,361
[SPEAKER_07]: This is crazy.

971
01:17:57,461 --> 01:17:59,161
[SPEAKER_07]: I've never seen this happen on Orange Lounge.

972
01:18:00,382 --> 01:18:04,023
[SPEAKER_07]: Did somebody hear that we were giving away a million dollars or something?

973
01:18:04,263 --> 01:18:04,863
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know why.

974
01:18:04,883 --> 01:18:06,243
[SPEAKER_10]: They knew that I was back.

975
01:18:06,683 --> 01:18:10,744
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I've been telling people again to listen, so I don't know.

976
01:18:10,784 --> 01:18:11,485
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe that's the problem.

977
01:18:11,705 --> 01:18:13,305
[SPEAKER_07]: No, we're going to do something about it.

978
01:18:13,345 --> 01:18:16,546
[SPEAKER_07]: We're just going to have to pony up the extra money to double our cap, but...

979
01:18:17,765 --> 01:18:20,707
[SPEAKER_07]: That will involve probably all of us having to get a second job.

980
01:18:20,847 --> 01:18:21,948
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm kidding.

981
01:18:22,728 --> 01:18:23,689
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to do something about it.

982
01:18:23,709 --> 01:18:25,790
[SPEAKER_07]: We just can't do it tonight, so to speak.

983
01:18:25,830 --> 01:18:27,211
[SPEAKER_07]: So you guys are kind of locked out tonight.

984
01:18:27,271 --> 01:18:30,493
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're just surprised because we have not been in danger of hitting our cap.

985
01:18:30,993 --> 01:18:36,697
[SPEAKER_07]: But little known fact, or maybe not so little, but our podcast was actually featured on Yahoo this week.

986
01:18:37,117 --> 01:18:43,641
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think because of that, if you go to podcast.yahoo.com, you see a little picture of our podcast.

987
01:18:43,921 --> 01:18:44,642
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think...

988
01:18:45,362 --> 01:18:50,525
[SPEAKER_07]: That in turn created more podcast downloads, which in turn have created more show listeners.

989
01:18:51,605 --> 01:18:57,048
[SPEAKER_07]: We're very happy that folks are tuning in to listen to the madness, but it's kind of crazy at the same time.

990
01:18:59,093 --> 01:19:02,015
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Xander, since you're not able to listen to the show, is there anything you want to tell our listeners?

991
01:19:05,036 --> 01:19:07,318
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I can't think of anything right now.

992
01:19:07,638 --> 01:19:08,778
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

993
01:19:08,798 --> 01:19:10,199
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I had something before.

994
01:19:10,700 --> 01:19:12,420
[SPEAKER_02]: I always lose it whenever I call you guys.

995
01:19:12,541 --> 01:19:15,322
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the pressures of being on air that make you forget things, huh?

996
01:19:15,422 --> 01:19:16,283
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

997
01:19:16,303 --> 01:19:21,345
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you ever wonder why we don't ever talk about video games on the live show, it's the pressures of being on air.

998
01:19:21,806 --> 01:19:23,006
[SPEAKER_07]: We completely forget about games.

999
01:19:23,627 --> 01:19:23,807
[SPEAKER_07]: We do.

1000
01:19:25,455 --> 01:19:26,596
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, Xander, well, thanks for the call.

1001
01:19:26,636 --> 01:19:27,356
[SPEAKER_07]: Have a good one, okay?

1002
01:19:27,416 --> 01:19:28,056
[SPEAKER_07]: And I hope you get in.

1003
01:19:28,316 --> 01:19:28,657
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1004
01:19:28,977 --> 01:19:29,657
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, keep trying.

1005
01:19:30,197 --> 01:19:30,418
[SPEAKER_07]: Later.

1006
01:19:32,399 --> 01:19:33,599
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, thank you, Xander, for calling.

1007
01:19:33,819 --> 01:19:37,881
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, we're actually going to shut off the Skyplane just for a little bit and go to an actual break.

1008
01:19:37,901 --> 01:19:45,605
[SPEAKER_07]: We are going to come back, so if you haven't gotten through just yet, don't cry and scream just yet, because we are going to take some more calls a little later in the show, I promise.

1009
01:19:46,166 --> 01:19:48,487
[SPEAKER_07]: But I really have to pee, so that means we take a break.

1010
01:19:49,147 --> 01:19:49,527
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

1011
01:19:49,747 --> 01:19:50,788
[SPEAKER_07]: That's just how it is, guys.

1012
01:19:50,828 --> 01:19:52,709
[SPEAKER_07]: When I've got to go potty, we go to a break.

1013
01:19:54,980 --> 01:19:58,402
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're going to go to break and we're going to come back with more Orange Lounge Radio.

1014
01:19:59,123 --> 01:20:00,224
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think we'll start off this break.

1015
01:20:00,244 --> 01:20:01,385
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll do some DDR music.

1016
01:20:02,185 --> 01:20:04,107
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you want to do Rock Lobster?

1017
01:20:04,147 --> 01:20:05,147
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have Rock Lobster.

1018
01:20:05,227 --> 01:20:07,069
[SPEAKER_07]: I have Rome and I have Love Shack.

1019
01:20:07,089 --> 01:20:07,909
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have Rock Lobster.

1020
01:20:07,929 --> 01:20:09,350
[SPEAKER_10]: How can you not have Rock Lobster?

1021
01:20:09,390 --> 01:20:09,831
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

1022
01:20:09,991 --> 01:20:11,952
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I'll get it for later.

1023
01:20:12,753 --> 01:20:14,554
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, we're going to do some DDR music in this break.

1024
01:20:16,656 --> 01:20:20,919
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yes, Dark Sakura wanted to hear some You're Not Here, which was a song in DDR.

1025
01:20:20,939 --> 01:20:24,021
[SPEAKER_10]: That's one of the songs that I built out in my car when no one's in there with me.

1026
01:20:25,206 --> 01:20:27,068
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to hear your lovely singing voice sometime.

1027
01:20:28,169 --> 01:20:29,310
[SPEAKER_10]: You won't because I don't have one.

1028
01:20:32,113 --> 01:20:32,613
[SPEAKER_07]: Fine.

1029
01:20:32,813 --> 01:20:38,659
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio and your calls.

1030
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:40,841
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, we'll get the Mflow.

1031
01:20:40,941 --> 01:20:44,264
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't have Mirrorball Satellite.

1032
01:20:45,345 --> 01:20:47,587
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll play Mflow from Third Style and they'll like it.

1033
01:20:49,755 --> 01:20:50,637
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll be back after this.

1034
01:21:23,148 --> 01:21:26,936
[SPEAKER_17]: We risk our dreams forever, the raindrops blowin' the wind, it's deadly

1035
01:21:33,254 --> 01:21:34,495
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you for watching!

1036
01:21:56,040 --> 01:22:16,307
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm strung out, addicted to you, my body aches, now that you're gone My supplies fell through, you let me give me everything you had and more You craved my happiness, when you made me feel joy in me, just smile for now

1037

Thanks for watching!

1039

Thanks for watching!

1040
01:24:17,638 --> 01:24:19,340
Turn around, look at what you see

1041
01:25:52,371 --> 01:25:57,158
[SPEAKER_17]: Love or truth, this is what I prove, between me and you.

1042
01:25:57,198 --> 01:26:00,022
[SPEAKER_17]: Love or truth, whichever you choose, is for me.

1043
01:27:20,232 --> 01:27:20,693
[SPEAKER_20]: I got a beat.

1044
01:27:47,780 --> 01:27:50,742
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, so typically this is the part of the show where we'd come back on air.

1045
01:27:50,782 --> 01:27:55,445
[SPEAKER_07]: However, due to popular demand from our chatroom, we are going to do one more song.

1046
01:27:55,565 --> 01:27:58,466
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's a brand new song from DDR Ultramix 3.

1047
01:27:59,307 --> 01:28:01,728
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to play this full song because it just rocks that much.

1048
01:28:02,248 --> 01:28:02,569
[SPEAKER_07]: Enjoy.

1049
01:28:02,589 --> 01:28:06,391
[SPEAKER_07]: It has a quiet opening, but trust me, the song's playing.

1050
01:28:12,975 --> 01:28:13,295
Ultramix 3

1051
01:28:21,524 --> 01:28:22,250
Thanks for watching!

1052
01:28:35,842 --> 01:28:56,284
[SPEAKER_18]: Istanbul was Constantinople, now it's Istanbul, now Constantinople Been a long time gone, Constantinople, now it's Thursday night, on a moonlit night Every gal in Constantinople lives in Istanbul, now Constantinople So if you like dating Constantinople, she'll be waiting in Istanbul Even old New York was once New Amsterdam

1053
01:28:56,804 --> 01:28:57,784
[SPEAKER_18]: Why'd they change it?

1054
01:28:57,884 --> 01:28:58,585
[SPEAKER_18]: I can't say.

1055
01:28:58,885 --> 01:29:00,745
[SPEAKER_18]: People just liked it better that way.

1056
01:29:00,946 --> 01:29:02,826
[SPEAKER_18]: So, take me back to Constantinople.

1057
01:29:02,866 --> 01:29:04,987
[SPEAKER_18]: No, you can't go back to Constantinople.

1058
01:29:05,007 --> 01:29:06,187
[SPEAKER_18]: Been a long time gone.

1059
01:29:06,207 --> 01:29:08,688
[SPEAKER_18]: Constantinople, why did Constantinople get the works?

1060
01:29:09,208 --> 01:29:12,610
[SPEAKER_18]: That's nobody's business but the Turks.

1061
01:29:12,690 --> 01:29:13,010
Istanbul.

1062
01:29:13,070 --> 01:29:13,390
Istanbul.

1063
01:29:13,470 --> 01:29:13,770
[SPEAKER_18]: Istanbul.

1064
01:29:29,091 --> 01:29:37,839
[SPEAKER_18]: Even Old New York was once New Amsterdam Why they changed it, I can't say You just liked it better that way!

[SPEAKER_18]: Istanbul was Constantinople, now it's Istanbul The Constantinople, they're a long time gone The Constantinople, why did Constantinople get the works?

1066
01:29:46,046 --> 01:29:48,869

1067
01:29:57,893 --> 01:30:05,756
So take me back to Constantinople No you can't go back to Constantinople Been a long time gone, Constantinople Out of Constantinople, get the works That's nobody's business but the Turks

1068
01:30:33,612 --> 01:30:39,536
[SPEAKER_07]: We're back here on Orange Lounge Radio, that was a little bit of Istanbul, not Constantinople, but they might be giants.

1069
01:30:40,436 --> 01:30:46,020
[SPEAKER_07]: That mp3 file was a little quiet, sorry guys, I had to turn that up in the middle there, and sorry for the volume.

1070
01:30:47,161 --> 01:30:51,143
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, we're back here on Orange Lounge Radio, and we've been talking about Ultramix 3 a little bit.

1071
01:30:51,183 --> 01:30:58,168
[SPEAKER_07]: We were taking some calls over Skype, and I do want to take some more calls over Skype very shortly, and get to the cage match as well, we got that to worry about.

1072
01:30:58,188 --> 01:30:59,609
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, what's up, what's on your mind?

1073
01:31:00,228 --> 01:31:00,528
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing.

1074
01:31:00,588 --> 01:31:04,970
[SPEAKER_04]: I figure I'll save it for after the KH match in my normal segment, which I cover the sim news.

1075
01:31:05,870 --> 01:31:07,191
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there actually going to be sim news tonight?

1076
01:31:07,251 --> 01:31:08,051
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course!

1077
01:31:09,672 --> 01:31:12,373
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you know that DDR Mania X actually came back?

1078
01:31:12,533 --> 01:31:12,913
[SPEAKER_07]: Did they?

1079
01:31:13,413 --> 01:31:14,154
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't know that.

1080
01:31:14,314 --> 01:31:15,895
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently they've been up for a while now.

1081
01:31:15,915 --> 01:31:17,775
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I have a confession to make?

1082
01:31:18,516 --> 01:31:19,316
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, no.

1083
01:31:19,376 --> 01:31:21,277
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to offend anybody when I say this.

1084
01:31:22,202 --> 01:31:25,383
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't really visit any Bomani sites besides DDR Freakin' Orange Lounge.

1085
01:31:25,723 --> 01:31:26,323
[SPEAKER_07]: I really don't.

1086
01:31:26,943 --> 01:31:37,005
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Bomani style, once in a great while, I kind of lurk just to kind of see what the goings-ons are, and I think I've done the same on Air in Japan, but on a regular basis, I only visit DDR Freakin' Orange Lounge.

1087
01:31:37,425 --> 01:31:38,585
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't really surf the other sites.

1088
01:31:39,426 --> 01:31:42,366
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's not that they're bad sites, it's just I don't have time.

1089
01:31:42,766 --> 01:31:43,286
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, it is.

1090
01:31:43,406 --> 01:31:45,067
[SPEAKER_07]: We will have... No, it's not.

1091
01:31:45,307 --> 01:31:50,228
[SPEAKER_04]: We will have, hopefully, if everything works out, and I will go into this later...

1092
01:31:52,433 --> 01:31:55,018
[SPEAKER_04]: We will have more stuff in our download section for our PSP site.

1093
01:31:55,418 --> 01:31:57,502
[SPEAKER_04]: Stuff that's related to the show.

1094
01:31:58,363 --> 01:31:59,926
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be awesome.

1095
01:32:01,548 --> 01:32:04,593
[SPEAKER_04]: Because this hasn't been posted anywhere except for Japanese sites.

1096
01:32:06,960 --> 01:32:07,020
[SPEAKER_07]: D.R.

1097
01:32:07,080 --> 01:32:07,180
[SPEAKER_07]: ANGEL

1098
01:32:28,454 --> 01:32:31,676
[SPEAKER_07]: Your Mama Joke of the Week Today's haiku is a summarization of Gulliver's Fowls by Jonathan Swift.

1099
01:32:31,696 --> 01:32:34,278
[SPEAKER_07]: The size was first great, then small, and much vexed to learn, but the size does matter.

1100
01:32:34,298 --> 01:32:34,638
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

1101
01:32:34,658 --> 01:32:34,879
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

1102
01:32:58,391 --> 01:33:02,293
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, if you ever run out of advice columns, you should just have the haiku of the week on the podcast.

1103
01:33:03,613 --> 01:33:04,294
[SPEAKER_10]: The Kama Sutra.

1104
01:33:05,354 --> 01:33:07,535
[SPEAKER_10]: Advice for those in a difficult position.

1105
01:33:07,715 --> 01:33:09,156
[SPEAKER_10]: First, be flexible.

1106
01:33:14,818 --> 01:33:20,880
[SPEAKER_07]: Speaking of the Kama Sutra, let's talk about the Burning Crusade, things you don't want after practicing the Kama Sutra.

1107
01:33:21,180 --> 01:33:22,421
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't want a Burning Crusade.

1108
01:33:23,439 --> 01:33:26,000
[SPEAKER_07]: Angel, you're one of our resident World of Warcraft whores.

1109
01:33:26,240 --> 01:33:27,701
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's got the highest level?

1110
01:33:27,741 --> 01:33:28,341
[SPEAKER_07]: What's your highest level?

1111
01:33:28,361 --> 01:33:28,561
[SPEAKER_07]: Me.

1112
01:33:28,901 --> 01:33:29,502
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura?

1113
01:33:29,522 --> 01:33:30,182
[SPEAKER_07]: Seven.

1114
01:33:30,382 --> 01:33:31,683
[SPEAKER_07]: And Loki, you don't play that bullshit.

1115
01:33:31,783 --> 01:33:34,564
[SPEAKER_07]: My highest level is 16, so what's yours?

1116
01:33:34,624 --> 01:33:36,245
[SPEAKER_10]: Currently, mine's 43.

1117
01:33:36,885 --> 01:33:38,646
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, you're the official WoW whore.

1118
01:33:38,666 --> 01:33:40,927
[SPEAKER_07]: So what's going on in the World of WoW?

1119
01:33:42,187 --> 01:33:45,168
[SPEAKER_07]: First off, your hair looks good, though, DarkSakura.

1120
01:33:45,308 --> 01:33:45,669
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks good.

1121
01:33:45,829 --> 01:33:46,529
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks pink.

1122
01:33:47,089 --> 01:33:47,569
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks good.

1123
01:33:47,609 --> 01:33:48,410
[SPEAKER_07]: I like the color.

1124
01:33:48,670 --> 01:33:49,890
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, anyway, so...

1125
01:33:51,687 --> 01:34:01,594
[SPEAKER_07]: BlizzCon was this past weekend, and I would have gone had I had more interest a couple months ago in what Blizzard was doing, but I kind of ignored World of Warcraft for a long, long time.

1126
01:34:02,355 --> 01:34:02,815
[SPEAKER_07]: You all know.

1127
01:34:03,295 --> 01:34:06,297
[SPEAKER_07]: And I never really got into Warcraft 3 or Warcraft 2.

1128
01:34:07,098 --> 01:34:10,500
[SPEAKER_07]: I played a lot of Warcraft 2, actually, but I was really fucking bad at it.

1129
01:34:10,560 --> 01:34:14,023
[SPEAKER_07]: When I say really fucking bad, I mean really fucking bad at Warcraft.

1130
01:34:14,103 --> 01:34:16,565
[SPEAKER_07]: I did not have the brain capacity to handle so many things going on at once.

1131
01:34:17,406 --> 01:34:19,147
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, World of Warcraft is not a problem for me.

1132
01:34:19,408 --> 01:34:20,028
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, man.

1133
01:34:20,889 --> 01:34:22,010
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't even explain it.

1134
01:34:22,230 --> 01:34:31,157
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I know there's a lot out there, you know, City of Heroes and now soon City of Villains and Final Fantasy XI and just, you know, there's a lot out there.

1135
01:34:31,177 --> 01:34:33,119
[SPEAKER_10]: EQ too, yeah.

1136
01:34:34,220 --> 01:34:40,425
[SPEAKER_10]: But World of Warcraft for me, wow, it's just, no pun intended.

1137
01:34:40,565 --> 01:34:41,446
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, all right.

1138
01:34:41,826 --> 01:34:42,186
[SPEAKER_07]: That's cool.

1139
01:34:42,447 --> 01:34:42,847
[SPEAKER_07]: So what's up?

1140
01:34:42,887 --> 01:34:44,128
[SPEAKER_07]: What's going to happen with this new expansion?

1141
01:34:44,368 --> 01:34:45,369
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, so much.

1142
01:34:46,790 --> 01:34:53,716
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to have what's called rideable mounts, which currently they have mounts for each race.

1143
01:34:54,837 --> 01:35:09,089
[SPEAKER_10]: When you hit 40, you can save up all your money and go train on riding and then go get your mount so that you can be all cool and ride all fast around the lands rather than walking because, well, we all know walking sucks.

1144
01:35:09,149 --> 01:35:10,010
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, walking sucks.

1145
01:35:10,350 --> 01:35:12,231
[SPEAKER_07]: and flying those birds takes forever sometimes.

1146
01:35:12,271 --> 01:35:16,453
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, flying those birds can take forever and they can be expensive depending on where you need to go.

1147
01:35:16,613 --> 01:35:18,653
[SPEAKER_10]: So, that's cool.

1148
01:35:18,693 --> 01:35:22,195
[SPEAKER_10]: They're going to have flyable mounts now in the new expansion.

1149
01:35:23,015 --> 01:35:27,897
[SPEAKER_10]: There's also going to be a lot of areas you need to explore and stuff like that.

1150
01:35:29,458 --> 01:35:37,261
[SPEAKER_10]: They're raising the level cap from 60 to 70 which will enable us to go beyond the Dark Portal.

1151
01:35:38,402 --> 01:35:39,262
[SPEAKER_10]: If you guys remember

1152
01:35:41,344 --> 01:35:46,270
[SPEAKER_10]: Warcraft 2 expansion, Beyond the Dark Portal, and then Warcraft 3.

1153
01:35:46,910 --> 01:35:56,842
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're going to be able to go through the portal, and I believe one of the things that you can do when you go Beyond the Dark Portal...

1154
01:35:57,882 --> 01:35:59,822
[SPEAKER_10]: New Race for the Horde is Blood Elves

1155
01:36:26,915 --> 01:36:37,539
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, I do not know what the Alliance is going to get, but, ah, well, it's rumored it's going to be Pandarian, so, or Pandaren, no, Pandaren, that's it.

1156
01:36:38,359 --> 01:36:46,102
[SPEAKER_10]: But, yeah, so, um, yeah, I don't know, am I forgetting something, Mr. Robb?

1157
01:36:47,444 --> 01:36:52,007
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you hit on most of the big points about what's going on with the expansion.

1158
01:36:53,027 --> 01:36:56,069
[SPEAKER_07]: The rumored Pandarian would be so cool if that really happens.

1159
01:36:57,370 --> 01:36:58,831
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you hit on most of the other big stuff.

1160
01:36:59,411 --> 01:37:04,214
[SPEAKER_07]: There's going to be a new profession, like alchemy and stuff, to go along with the socketed items.

1161
01:37:04,234 --> 01:37:06,655
[SPEAKER_07]: You could be a jewel master.

1162
01:37:08,336 --> 01:37:09,997
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I can't really think of anything else.

1163
01:37:10,297 --> 01:37:14,960
[SPEAKER_10]: I probably did forget something or whatever along the way, but

1164
01:37:15,441 --> 01:37:15,741
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.com

1165
01:37:33,676 --> 01:37:36,937
[SPEAKER_10]: heavily, heavily into World of Warcraft, and that's all they do on the station.

1166
01:37:36,957 --> 01:37:37,897
[SPEAKER_07]: You can plug them, I don't care.

1167
01:37:38,357 --> 01:37:39,757
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, wcradio.com.

1168
01:37:39,897 --> 01:37:40,257
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1169
01:37:41,037 --> 01:37:41,638
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you know that.

1170
01:37:41,658 --> 01:37:43,538
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm all about supporting the independent radio.

1171
01:37:43,658 --> 01:37:49,059
[SPEAKER_07]: I just don't want you coming on here and plugging, you know, 97.1 to hit, say FM, you know, fuck them.

1172
01:37:49,599 --> 01:37:52,320
[SPEAKER_10]: No, my number one will always be Orange Hill Radio.

1173
01:37:52,360 --> 01:37:52,940
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you're sweet.

1174
01:37:53,060 --> 01:37:53,300
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1175
01:37:54,320 --> 01:37:57,861
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, so, I don't know, I think I pretty much hit everything.

1176
01:37:58,521 --> 01:37:59,301
[SPEAKER_10]: New instances in...

1177
01:37:59,972 --> 01:38:00,713
[SPEAKER_10]: All that stuff, too.

1178
01:38:00,833 --> 01:38:02,754
[SPEAKER_10]: So, hey, there's a lot to look forward to.

1179
01:38:02,854 --> 01:38:03,375
[SPEAKER_07]: Good times.

1180
01:38:03,775 --> 01:38:04,416
[SPEAKER_07]: Looking forward to it.

1181
01:38:04,876 --> 01:38:05,256
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1182
01:38:05,637 --> 01:38:08,379
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to go back over to the Skype line and take some of your calls.

1183
01:38:08,419 --> 01:38:16,866
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you do want to call into the show, you can do that by going over to our Skype line at www.OrangeLoungeRadio.com and clicking on Interact With Us for more information.

1184
01:38:17,246 --> 01:38:23,131
[SPEAKER_07]: Or you can always call us the old-fashioned way, and that is via the telephone, 916-226-9067.

1185
01:38:23,491 --> 01:38:24,492
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go to our first call.

1186
01:38:24,532 --> 01:38:25,653
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1187
01:38:26,908 --> 01:38:28,292
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, Sephiroth1215.

1188
01:38:28,572 --> 01:38:30,358
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, Sephiroth1215, what's on your mind?

1189
01:38:32,423 --> 01:38:33,928
[SPEAKER_12]: Actually, a lot of stuff today.

1190
01:38:34,963 --> 01:38:45,727
[SPEAKER_12]: First of all, to start off, I'll say the Ultramix 3 list so far sounds pretty interesting, and it just sounds like they give Konami of Hawaii a big budget now.

1191
01:38:46,627 --> 01:38:55,070
[SPEAKER_07]: It is kind of weird, like, all these songs from so many random different places, but I don't know, I strangely dig it.

1192
01:38:55,090 --> 01:38:56,771
[SPEAKER_07]: There really is something for everyone.

1193
01:38:56,871 --> 01:38:59,392
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I know they've said that about previous DDR mixes,

1194
01:39:00,212 --> 01:39:14,184
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, there's something for everyone, but no, seriously guys, this time, something for everyone, like even like Ray Charles, no FX, come on, that's tapping into audiences that never would have looked twice at DDR before, so that's something else.

1195
01:39:16,098 --> 01:39:22,444
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, but otherwise, something you haven't really talked about is the recent release of DDR Mario Mix here.

1196
01:39:24,086 --> 01:39:30,672
[SPEAKER_07]: I kind of glossed over DDR Mario Mix because I haven't picked up my copy yet, because I bought Soul Calibur III instead this week.

1197
01:39:32,794 --> 01:39:35,176
[SPEAKER_07]: which should show you where I'm at DDR-wise.

1198
01:39:35,276 --> 01:39:40,521
[SPEAKER_07]: Plus, you know, I just, it doesn't seem like something that's that difficult, but I don't know.

1199
01:39:40,541 --> 01:39:40,961
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you think?

1200
01:39:41,001 --> 01:39:41,582
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you pick it up?

1201
01:39:43,463 --> 01:39:46,726
[SPEAKER_12]: Technically, I did, but I got it for free.

1202
01:39:47,186 --> 01:39:47,787
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, okay.

1203
01:39:47,947 --> 01:39:49,708
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, did you, like, win one of those tournaments or something?

1204
01:39:51,010 --> 01:39:54,112
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, only three people showed up, and two of which were my friends.

1205
01:39:54,613 --> 01:39:55,193
[SPEAKER_07]: Good job.

1206
01:39:55,273 --> 01:39:55,954
[SPEAKER_07]: Good job, anyway.

1207
01:39:57,358 --> 01:40:02,223
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, so I just got it for free, and I unlocked pretty much everything just last night.

1208
01:40:02,743 --> 01:40:03,724
[SPEAKER_07]: Was there anything really cool?

1209
01:40:05,025 --> 01:40:09,029
[SPEAKER_07]: Or was it all Mario stuff and classical tunes being redone?

1210
01:40:09,810 --> 01:40:11,231
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it's okay.

1211
01:40:11,331 --> 01:40:12,412
[SPEAKER_12]: The song's okay.

1212
01:40:13,233 --> 01:40:20,399
[SPEAKER_12]: What I think is interesting is the way they did it, of how it's just like a Mario game where you go through different worlds and go through the levels in the worlds.

1213
01:40:21,260 --> 01:40:21,620
[SPEAKER_12]: Really?

1214
01:40:21,640 --> 01:40:21,861
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

1215
01:40:24,878 --> 01:40:29,863
[SPEAKER_12]: But otherwise, I think it's really good that I got it for free.

1216
01:40:30,163 --> 01:40:33,286
[SPEAKER_12]: Because I wouldn't really pay for it unless it was maybe cheaper.

1217
01:40:34,827 --> 01:40:36,649
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's a little too much money for me right now, too.

1218
01:40:36,669 --> 01:40:38,811
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't they want like 60 bucks for it with the pad and everything?

1219
01:40:39,631 --> 01:40:42,953
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, but I actually think that soft pad is really nice.

1220
01:40:43,313 --> 01:40:45,495
[SPEAKER_12]: It has more padding in the middle.

1221
01:40:46,736 --> 01:40:59,684
[SPEAKER_07]: The pads have been getting progressively nicer through various CDR mixes, because we had the original one, which is okay, and there was actually the old, old Konami mat for the Dreamcast that had that funny layer of plastic over the mat.

1222
01:41:00,104 --> 01:41:01,285
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, you had these mats.

1223
01:41:01,305 --> 01:41:02,906
[SPEAKER_07]: They were like some of the first mats I ever played on.

1224
01:41:03,206 --> 01:41:08,268
[SPEAKER_10]: I had the Dreamcast ones that were the triple sticky thing, and now they slide apart.

1225
01:41:10,069 --> 01:41:11,850
[SPEAKER_10]: They're not as good as one thinks they are.

1226
01:41:12,670 --> 01:41:15,611
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the Xbox ones were really good, and now the GameCube ones.

1227
01:41:15,631 --> 01:41:17,112
[SPEAKER_07]: So they've had a lot of time to get it right.

1228
01:41:19,573 --> 01:41:23,834
[SPEAKER_12]: So far I think those are the best softpads, but I have a metal pad anyway, so whatever.

1229
01:41:25,055 --> 01:41:27,636
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you think there's enough here for DDR fans to be happy?

1230
01:41:29,537 --> 01:41:29,657
[SPEAKER_12]: Um...

1231
01:41:32,096 --> 01:41:35,358
[SPEAKER_12]: Mario Mix is one of those games that's going to be more for kids.

1232
01:42:01,618 --> 01:42:05,301
[SPEAKER_07]: People that just are obsessed with Nintendo, like Ultimate Nintendo Fanboys and stuff.

1233
01:42:06,361 --> 01:42:12,386
[SPEAKER_07]: Or, you know, people that like the GameCube, or only have a GameCube, or like the GameCube things.

1234
01:42:12,706 --> 01:42:15,628
[SPEAKER_07]: I think most of the hardcore DDR people are going to find their game somewhere else.

1235
01:42:16,589 --> 01:42:20,171
[SPEAKER_12]: It's definitely a good mix to start out with for somebody who hasn't played yet, though.

1236
01:42:20,332 --> 01:42:20,852
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's cool.

1237
01:42:21,092 --> 01:42:21,793
[SPEAKER_12]: It's definitely good.

1238
01:42:22,113 --> 01:42:22,753
[SPEAKER_07]: They need that, too.

1239
01:42:24,174 --> 01:42:28,938
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, well, Sephiroth1215, I'll let you have your final words, then we're going to let you go and try to get another call.

1240
01:42:30,374 --> 01:42:43,720
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, last thing I wanted to say, which I can't confirm or anything, I just heard around, is that the Xbox 360 is, you can't get the premiums in first-come, first-served stores.

1241
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:49,143
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope that's a lot of bullshit, because if it is not bullshit and that leads out to be true, I'm going to be one pissed motherfucker.

1242
01:42:49,503 --> 01:42:51,024
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to be one pissed motherfucker.

1243
01:42:51,064 --> 01:42:55,926
[SPEAKER_07]: I should not have to reserve that crap without them telling me.

1244
01:42:57,959 --> 01:42:59,264
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't be sure of that though.

1245
01:42:59,304 --> 01:43:00,228
[SPEAKER_07]: Where did you hear it though?

1246
01:43:00,268 --> 01:43:02,356
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you hear it at a store that does reservations?

1247
01:43:03,690 --> 01:43:08,433
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, yeah, first, I heard it online in GameFAQs, which I'm like, whatever, I don't really believe you.

1248
01:43:08,513 --> 01:43:17,979
[SPEAKER_12]: Then I went to a store, and they said, yeah, we're not allowed to take any cores, because they're sending all the cores out to the stores, and we're getting all the premiums to try and get all the pre-orders up.

1249
01:43:18,900 --> 01:43:21,261
[SPEAKER_07]: I have this weird feeling, I hope it's not true, or I'm gonna be pissed.

1250
01:43:21,561 --> 01:43:26,244
[SPEAKER_07]: I cannot imagine a huge chain like Best Buy, that they would screw over somebody like Best Buy or Toys R Us with that.

1251
01:43:26,825 --> 01:43:26,965
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

1252
01:43:28,215 --> 01:43:31,798
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, maybe we'll call Microsoft on the podcast or something.

1253
01:43:32,038 --> 01:43:36,061
[SPEAKER_07]: If it wasn't so late on a Sunday night they were open, I swear we'd call somebody and try to figure it out.

1254
01:43:36,762 --> 01:43:39,764
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a feeling it's false, but we'll see.

1255
01:43:39,824 --> 01:43:41,645
[SPEAKER_07]: If it does turn out to be true, I'm going to be pissed.

1256
01:43:43,547 --> 01:43:48,110
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, you can still reserve it, but I don't think you're guaranteed it until next year sometime.

1257
01:43:49,311 --> 01:43:49,831
[SPEAKER_07]: What a crap.

1258
01:43:50,112 --> 01:43:50,692
[SPEAKER_07]: What a bunch of crap.

1259
01:43:51,333 --> 01:43:53,054
[SPEAKER_07]: I will get one launch day, just you wait.

1260
01:43:55,075 --> 01:43:56,256
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, Zaku, what's on your mind?

1261
01:44:21,284 --> 01:44:26,167
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm posting up a link right now that pretty much might be of your interest.

1262
01:44:26,647 --> 01:44:31,510
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you might hate it, some of you might say, what the fuck am I doing, but here we go.

1263
01:44:32,470 --> 01:44:37,473
[SPEAKER_00]: It's from CDR Freaks New York forums, but I think you'll see what I'm trying to tell you.

1264
01:44:37,733 --> 01:44:40,675
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so give us a description of it while it loads on the computers here.

1265
01:44:42,116 --> 01:44:46,018
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, basically, MTV wants New York City DDR players.

1266
01:44:46,690 --> 01:44:53,896
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't know why, but this dude who was probably recruited by them is seeking our kind.

1267
01:44:55,317 --> 01:44:58,500
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so if you live in the New York area, let's see.

1268
01:45:00,922 --> 01:45:05,185
[SPEAKER_07]: As you can see in the thread, I've already signed up as well as several other prominent players.

1269
01:45:05,225 --> 01:45:05,725
[SPEAKER_07]: They basically...

1270
01:45:30,410 --> 01:45:37,433
[SPEAKER_00]: They already called me back that same day, and MTV is supposed to be calling me soon about the interview date.

1271
01:45:38,173 --> 01:45:38,473
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

1272
01:45:38,493 --> 01:45:40,154
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll drop our name a whole bunch, all right?

1273
01:45:42,215 --> 01:45:42,715
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see.

1274
01:45:42,895 --> 01:45:43,715
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just messing with you.

1275
01:45:43,755 --> 01:45:44,395
[SPEAKER_07]: Have fun with it.

1276
01:45:44,435 --> 01:45:44,936
[SPEAKER_07]: Have fun with it.

1277
01:45:44,956 --> 01:45:45,556
[SPEAKER_07]: That's great news.

1278
01:45:47,056 --> 01:45:51,838
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's basically what they want.

1279
01:45:51,878 --> 01:45:58,941
[SPEAKER_00]: They want sociable and outgoing people to just break that stereotype, which is basically what we are in a nutshell.

1280
01:45:59,952 --> 01:46:01,053
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, well, yeah.

1281
01:46:02,613 --> 01:46:08,076
[SPEAKER_00]: And as far as Ultramix 3 songs go, freestylers are fine.

1282
01:46:08,996 --> 01:46:09,977
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all you need to know.

1283
01:46:10,037 --> 01:46:24,164
[SPEAKER_00]: If we were able, you know, a couple of weeks ago to hook up a PS2 to a DDR machine and use it as such, we could probably do the same thing for an Xbox and whore out the songs for freestyle routines.

1284
01:46:24,244 --> 01:46:26,025
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, it's going to be great for freestyle people.

1285
01:46:26,305 --> 01:46:28,386
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's got such a solid song list.

1286
01:46:29,413 --> 01:46:34,217
[SPEAKER_00]: If we could get it, that's if we could, you know, hook up an Xbox to a DDR machine in about a year.

1287
01:46:34,477 --> 01:46:35,098
[SPEAKER_00]: You never know.

1288
01:46:35,759 --> 01:46:36,239
[SPEAKER_07]: You never know.

1289
01:46:38,100 --> 01:46:38,341
[SPEAKER_00]: Mm-hmm.

1290
01:46:38,441 --> 01:46:39,181
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, okay.

1291
01:46:39,261 --> 01:46:40,642
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, good luck with the MTV thing.

1292
01:46:40,662 --> 01:46:43,645
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, I don't really watch MTV, but I'll make an exception.

1293
01:46:43,705 --> 01:46:46,567
[SPEAKER_07]: If you get on it, I'll TiVo it or something.

1294
01:46:47,768 --> 01:46:49,450
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I just hope I get in.

1295
01:46:50,130 --> 01:46:50,851
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

1296
01:46:51,531 --> 01:46:55,915
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's probably in a few weeks anyway, so... As I said...

1297
01:46:56,556 --> 01:46:58,477
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch out, I might be on TV.

1298
01:46:58,777 --> 01:46:59,197
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1299
01:46:59,417 --> 01:47:03,378
[SPEAKER_00]: If I am, just, you know, you'll probably mention it on Sunday.

1300
01:47:04,498 --> 01:47:05,419
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe, we might.

1301
01:47:05,559 --> 01:47:06,279
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm kidding, we would.

1302
01:47:06,459 --> 01:47:06,739
[SPEAKER_07]: We would.

1303
01:47:07,759 --> 01:47:10,680
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, good luck with that, and, you know, again, name drop a lot.

1304
01:47:10,880 --> 01:47:11,860
[SPEAKER_07]: Orange Lounge, love it.

1305
01:47:11,981 --> 01:47:12,481
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm just kidding.

1306
01:47:13,101 --> 01:47:14,041
[SPEAKER_07]: Have a good one, alright?

1307
01:47:15,542 --> 01:47:16,942
[SPEAKER_07]: I gotta let you go so we can get more calls.

1308
01:47:18,260 --> 01:47:21,602
[SPEAKER_07]: Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match

1309
01:47:49,551 --> 01:47:50,251
[SPEAKER_07]: www.orangeloungeradio.com

1310
01:48:12,338 --> 01:48:16,102
[SPEAKER_07]: Song number one tonight is going for its fourth week win.

1311
01:48:16,603 --> 01:48:19,866
[SPEAKER_07]: If it wins tonight, it will be retired.

1312
01:48:19,906 --> 01:48:26,473
[SPEAKER_07]: It will be only the, I think, fifth song to be retired out of Orange Lounge Radio's cage match in the couple years we've been doing this.

1313
01:48:27,114 --> 01:48:27,354
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

1314
01:48:28,155 --> 01:48:29,535
[SPEAKER_07]: Here it is, it's song number four.

1315
01:48:29,555 --> 01:48:31,376
[SPEAKER_07]: And it wasn't even really picked by one of us.

1316
01:48:31,436 --> 01:48:34,797
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I put it in, but I put it in on behalf of Miklatov.

1317
01:48:35,237 --> 01:48:37,457
[SPEAKER_07]: So, just kind of interesting the way that works out.

1318
01:48:37,477 --> 01:48:41,678
[SPEAKER_07]: So this would be the first song that would get retired that was not even put in by one of us.

1319
01:48:42,058 --> 01:48:43,759
[SPEAKER_07]: So it would be very interesting to see what happens.

1320
01:48:44,079 --> 01:48:49,080
[SPEAKER_07]: So here it is, it's song number one, going for its fourth win in a row.

1321
01:48:49,120 --> 01:48:50,060
[SPEAKER_07]: Will it be retired?

1322
01:48:50,580 --> 01:48:51,161
[SPEAKER_07]: It's up to you.

1323
01:48:51,301 --> 01:48:52,721
[SPEAKER_07]: Pendulum withholds your color.

1324
01:51:05,232 --> 01:51:07,654
All right, let's get into song number two tonight.

1325
01:51:07,694 --> 01:51:09,915
Song number two is Dark Sakura's pick.

1326
01:51:09,935 --> 01:51:12,096
Dark Sakura, what did you pick for us?

1327
01:51:12,157 --> 01:51:12,337
It's...

1328
01:51:33,030 --> 01:51:33,870
[SPEAKER_07]: It's OG Bitch!

1329
01:52:09,232 --> 01:52:10,533
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for watching!

1330
01:55:11,289 --> 01:55:19,520
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, uttering her first words on the new microphone, DarkSakura will let us know how she liked OG Bitch.

1331
01:55:19,980 --> 01:55:20,281
[SPEAKER_17]: Nine.

1332
01:55:21,062 --> 01:55:22,844
[SPEAKER_07]: Get some nine from DarkSakura.

1333
01:55:23,845 --> 01:55:24,786
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think it went through.

1334
01:55:25,107 --> 01:55:26,529
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, give us a sentence.

1335
01:55:27,765 --> 01:55:28,506
[SPEAKER_07]: I like burritos.

1336
01:55:28,766 --> 01:55:29,286
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, that works.

1337
01:55:29,306 --> 01:55:29,667
[SPEAKER_07]: There we go.

1338
01:55:29,987 --> 01:55:30,347
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

1339
01:55:31,008 --> 01:55:31,408
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki.

1340
01:55:32,109 --> 01:55:33,970
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like burritos or that song.

1341
01:55:34,871 --> 01:55:35,711
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a five.

1342
01:55:36,172 --> 01:55:38,614
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like OG bitch.

1343
01:55:39,855 --> 01:55:40,215
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1344
01:55:40,275 --> 01:55:43,358
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that like... It seems very Latin to me.

1345
01:55:43,378 --> 01:55:45,399
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be original gangsta bitch, actually.

1346
01:55:46,881 --> 01:55:47,361
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1347
01:55:47,501 --> 01:55:49,322
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't get it.

1348
01:55:49,462 --> 01:55:51,504
[SPEAKER_07]: I kind of dug it because it had a cool beat to it.

1349
01:55:51,544 --> 01:55:52,505
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I liked the remix.

1350
01:55:52,905 --> 01:55:59,810
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not so sure I was up on the singing because the singing kind of had this kind of weird thing to it, but it was cool.

1351
01:56:00,051 --> 01:56:02,833
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it was kind of... It's a song I could see myself getting down at the club.

1352
01:56:03,633 --> 01:56:04,374
[SPEAKER_07]: OG clubbing.

1353
01:56:05,054 --> 01:56:05,955
[SPEAKER_07]: So I give it an 8.

1354
01:56:06,055 --> 01:56:06,936
[SPEAKER_07]: It was pretty good.

1355
01:56:08,077 --> 01:56:09,038
[SPEAKER_08]: Extifer, what did you think?

1356
01:56:10,579 --> 01:56:12,100
[SPEAKER_08]: She didn't sound like a gangsta.

1357
01:56:13,061 --> 01:56:13,261
[SPEAKER_08]: But...

1358
01:56:14,056 --> 01:56:17,179
[SPEAKER_08]: I will give it a five because I don't know what to think.

1359
01:56:17,239 --> 01:56:18,640
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm purely in the middle on that one.

1360
01:56:18,940 --> 01:56:19,360
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

1361
01:56:19,761 --> 01:56:20,141
[SPEAKER_06]: Angel?

1362
01:56:21,422 --> 01:56:22,943
[SPEAKER_10]: I liked the beat to it.

1363
01:56:22,983 --> 01:56:23,744
[SPEAKER_10]: It was pretty neat.

1364
01:56:23,944 --> 01:56:24,605
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, six.

1365
01:56:25,605 --> 01:56:25,886
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

1366
01:56:27,066 --> 01:56:33,031
[SPEAKER_07]: Song number three tonight, going up against Estro and Pendulum is... Loki, what'd you put in?

1367
01:56:33,972 --> 01:56:38,035
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, this is just one of those weeks where I had nothing really to put in.

1368
01:56:38,776 --> 01:56:42,679
[SPEAKER_04]: So, this song will go out to Captain Jack being dead and all, but, um,

1369
01:56:43,032 --> 01:56:52,584
[SPEAKER_04]: This is actually, I think out of all the songs I've listened to him, this best sums up, you know, kind of the mood with him being, you know, dead and everything.

1370
01:56:52,724 --> 01:56:54,906
[SPEAKER_04]: But, um, it's also really strange.

1371
01:56:55,447 --> 01:56:56,468
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a really strange song.

1372
01:56:56,488 --> 01:57:00,213
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm saying all those go to Pendulum because that's a fucking awesome song, but...

1373
01:57:00,999 --> 01:57:01,399
[SPEAKER_04]: Here you go.

1374
01:57:01,800 --> 01:57:02,480
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1375
01:57:02,500 --> 01:57:04,182
[SPEAKER_07]: You're going for the sympathy vote tonight.

1376
01:57:04,322 --> 01:57:06,103
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not even hoping to get any votes.

1377
01:57:06,183 --> 01:57:10,587
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, because the song I wanted to put in was too long and I didn't want to cut it down.

1378
01:57:10,807 --> 01:57:12,048
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

1379
01:57:12,248 --> 01:57:12,609
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

1380
01:57:13,069 --> 01:57:14,030
[SPEAKER_07]: Song number three.

1381
01:57:14,610 --> 01:57:15,511
[SPEAKER_07]: Going out to the man.

1382
01:57:15,811 --> 01:57:16,452
[SPEAKER_07]: Captain Jack.

1383
01:57:16,532 --> 01:57:18,413
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Captain Jack with Back Home.

1384
01:57:18,673 --> 01:57:18,994
[SPEAKER_07]: Enjoy.

1385
01:57:46,698 --> 01:57:59,504
[SPEAKER_17]: The captain wants to be back home And the captain fights against the storm He's always tuned against

1386
01:58:00,151 --> 01:58:03,817
[SPEAKER_17]: He always wants to live and be back home

1387
01:58:08,288 --> 01:58:28,183
[SPEAKER_14]: It was a lonely night with a pack full of dreams Miles away from home, I felt cold in the sea As if I was the only human being on Earth I thought about the soldiers and the peace camp there Couldn't stop thinking about my company About coming home, life and history How everything started with Captain Jack When will I meet you?

1388
01:58:28,263 --> 01:58:29,504
[SPEAKER_14]: When will I be back?

1389
01:58:29,924 --> 01:58:34,688
[SPEAKER_14]: Strike, try hard, give the best you can So never stop fighting for the peace in your land

1390
01:58:35,308 --> 01:58:53,423
[SPEAKER_17]: Come together and see the light All for one, like a stick of dynamite The captain wants to be back home And the captain fights against the storm He's always true to the game He always wants to live and be back home

1391
01:59:02,029 --> 01:59:07,274
[SPEAKER_14]: After hours and hours of marching through the land, there was something in the air held a flower in my hand.

1392
01:59:07,554 --> 01:59:09,976
[SPEAKER_14]: The grass was green and the moon shined bright.

1393
01:59:10,276 --> 01:59:12,498
[SPEAKER_14]: Remember that night when she held me tight.

1394
01:59:12,819 --> 01:59:18,223
[SPEAKER_14]: I went down to the river with the water, but look, I was longing for my band and for the crazy couple.

1395
01:59:18,323 --> 01:59:23,528
[SPEAKER_14]: When morning came and I reached the camp, I took a break and lay down in the warm white sand.

1396
01:59:23,708 --> 01:59:25,870
[SPEAKER_14]: So try, try hard and give the best you can.

1397
01:59:26,531 --> 01:59:43,491
[SPEAKER_17]: Never stop fighting for the peace in our land Come together and see the light All for one like a stick of dynamite The captain wants to be back home And the captain fights against the storm

1398
01:59:56,038 --> 02:00:09,153
[SPEAKER_17]: The captain wants to be back home And the captain is feeling all alone He's always true to himself He always wants to live and be back home

1399
02:00:17,683 --> 02:00:42,276
[SPEAKER_14]: Tak tak tak, never looking back Come and fight for Captain Jack Say it slow, but say it loud Join the peace camp and you'll be proud Jump and walk, train and talk Move your body, you're not a piece of chalk Scream and shout, call out my name It's Captain Jack, straight back again The captain wants to be back home

1400
02:00:44,393 --> 02:01:08,908
[SPEAKER_17]: And the captain fights against the storm He's always true to game He always wants to live and be back home The captain wants to be back home And the captain is feeling all alone

1401
02:01:15,430 --> 02:01:36,077
[SPEAKER_17]: The captain wants to live and be back home The captain wants to be back home And the captain fights against the storm He's always true to himself He always wants to live and be back home

1402
02:01:43,763 --> 02:01:54,234
[SPEAKER_17]: The captain wants to be back home And the captain is feeling all alone He's always true to himself

1403
02:02:41,468 --> 02:02:49,774
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, what did you think of that tribute that Loki picked there for Captain Jack?

1404
02:02:49,934 --> 02:02:52,596
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm presently bleeding out of my ears from brain hemorrhage.

1405
02:02:53,096 --> 02:02:54,898
[SPEAKER_07]: Careful, I think that's what Captain Jack died of.

1406
02:02:55,938 --> 02:02:56,379
[SPEAKER_10]: I know.

1407
02:02:56,999 --> 02:02:57,960
[SPEAKER_10]: This one gets a two.

1408
02:02:57,980 --> 02:03:00,262
[SPEAKER_07]: A two from DarkSakura.

1409
02:03:00,502 --> 02:03:00,882
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki!

1410
02:03:02,904 --> 02:03:05,205
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I don't know, it just...

1411
02:03:06,411 --> 02:03:07,211
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a weird song.

1412
02:03:07,531 --> 02:03:13,893
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the song was okay until he started doing his rapping or whatever that is.

1413
02:03:15,694 --> 02:03:19,735
[SPEAKER_04]: It gets like a 7 for the amount of days he's been dead.

1414
02:03:21,095 --> 02:03:25,496
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, I have to say his rapping reminded me of New Edition and Roni.

1415
02:03:26,516 --> 02:03:28,057
[SPEAKER_10]: With Bobby Brown trying to rap.

1416
02:03:28,857 --> 02:03:29,777
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of, kind of.

1417
02:03:30,197 --> 02:03:32,138
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, like I said, throw away songs to wear.

1418
02:03:34,058 --> 02:03:37,239
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what song kind of reminded me of something else?

1419
02:03:44,783 --> 02:03:45,403
[SPEAKER_07]: I like that song.

1420
02:03:45,423 --> 02:03:46,463
[SPEAKER_07]: And that song sucked too.

1421
02:03:46,943 --> 02:03:49,004
[SPEAKER_07]: I like it.

1422
02:03:49,364 --> 02:03:52,866
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, you know what, Captain Jack was the man, but he needs to stick to barking orders.

1423
02:03:53,426 --> 02:03:54,827
[SPEAKER_07]: Because that's when I want to pay attention.

1424
02:03:55,127 --> 02:03:55,507
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't like...

1425
02:03:56,631 --> 02:04:20,167
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't like that, I don't like that pussy Captain Jack in that song, I don't like that, I'm sorry, Captain Jack needs to go, and yes sir, yes sir, yes sir, I will party down right now, there is a song that's actually on the same CD that is called, I don't remember what it's called now, Sir Yes Sir, it's something like that, and it's about like Captain Jack,

1426
02:04:20,595 --> 02:04:25,017
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the kind of song that I'd like to listen at the stroke of 11.30 when I'm about to go to sleep at night.

1427
02:04:25,117 --> 02:04:25,577
[SPEAKER_07]: And then suddenly...

1428
02:04:47,605 --> 02:04:54,648
[SPEAKER_08]: Suddenly I'll wake up in the hospital surrounded by my hot bitches as I'm slipping into my coma.

1429
02:04:56,868 --> 02:04:58,169
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry, wait, hold on.

1430
02:04:58,209 --> 02:04:59,389
[SPEAKER_08]: I need to check with the judges.

1431
02:05:00,290 --> 02:05:04,051
[SPEAKER_07]: Judges, are we allowed to be insensitive after only a week?

1432
02:05:04,651 --> 02:05:05,251
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1433
02:05:05,331 --> 02:05:06,932
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that politically correct?

1434
02:05:06,952 --> 02:05:07,412
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes!

1435
02:05:07,832 --> 02:05:13,414
[SPEAKER_08]: I was never really sensitive to begin with, so I'm kind of... Please try not to piss off the listeners.

1436
02:05:13,834 --> 02:05:15,075
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi listeners, I love you.

1437
02:05:16,553 --> 02:05:25,059
[SPEAKER_08]: I will give it an 8, because I think that this song should win over the Pendulum song.

1438
02:05:25,159 --> 02:05:26,580
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't forget about the OG bitch!

1439
02:05:27,721 --> 02:05:28,582
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I don't know.

1440
02:05:28,642 --> 02:05:29,983
[SPEAKER_08]: She didn't sound like a gangsta.

1441
02:05:30,683 --> 02:05:35,467
[SPEAKER_08]: The Captain Jack is an OG bitch.

1442
02:05:35,827 --> 02:05:39,330
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm all for the true Compton gangstas.

1443
02:05:39,650 --> 02:05:43,913
[SPEAKER_08]: I like Compton gangstas, not Mexican Latina gangstas.

1444
02:05:45,352 --> 02:05:46,654
[SPEAKER_05]: Angel, what did you think?

1445
02:05:48,536 --> 02:05:53,863
[SPEAKER_10]: It kind of reminded me of the 80s, not so much love songs, but R&B love songs.

1446
02:05:53,903 --> 02:05:54,604
[SPEAKER_10]: The crappy songs, Angel.

1447
02:05:55,305 --> 02:05:56,226
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that'll work.

1448
02:06:04,984 --> 02:06:10,826
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, um, I'll be nice, I guess.

1449
02:06:10,846 --> 02:06:12,087
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm giving a six.

1450
02:06:13,567 --> 02:06:14,708
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, let's recap.

1451
02:06:14,748 --> 02:06:16,228
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not up to us, it's up to you.

1452
02:06:16,869 --> 02:06:18,889
[SPEAKER_07]: You folks in chat room, get your say.

1453
02:06:19,209 --> 02:06:20,770
[SPEAKER_07]: The three songs you can vote for tonight.

1454
02:06:20,810 --> 02:06:22,731
[SPEAKER_07]: Song number one, Pendulum, Hold Your Color.

1455
02:06:28,393 --> 02:06:33,895
[SPEAKER_07]: And song number two you can vote for tonight is Estero with OG Bitch, the Orange Factory Mix.

1456
02:06:41,827 --> 02:06:46,433
[SPEAKER_07]: And song number three you can vote for tonight is Captain Jack with Back Home.

1457
02:06:50,979 --> 02:06:55,124
[SPEAKER_14]: After hours and hours of listening to that song, my brain is hemorrhaging all night.

1458
02:07:05,318 --> 02:07:06,759
[SPEAKER_07]: I turned off the mics in the middle of that.

1459
02:07:07,360 --> 02:07:09,161
[SPEAKER_07]: It's probably best they didn't hear my little song there.

1460
02:07:10,242 --> 02:07:12,704
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, this is the part of the show.

1461
02:07:12,724 --> 02:07:13,724
[SPEAKER_07]: Place vote now.

1462
02:07:13,784 --> 02:07:15,366
[SPEAKER_07]: Send a private message to Sky Chatroom vote.

1463
02:07:16,266 --> 02:07:17,687
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, SimUpdate, what's up?

1464
02:07:18,027 --> 02:07:23,671
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, first off, as I mentioned before, DDR Maniacs is back up for all those who didn't know it.

1465
02:07:24,012 --> 02:07:24,132
[SPEAKER_04]: Woo!

1466
02:07:26,926 --> 02:07:28,287
[SPEAKER_07]: I was looking for and trying to find a link

1467
02:07:49,710 --> 02:07:50,511
[SPEAKER_04]: For the PSP

1468
02:08:08,257 --> 02:08:35,731
[SPEAKER_04]: the DDR one in action with full background videos and it looks pretty cool so far unfortunately all the links are down for it right now and the Beatmania one is available right now I tried downloading it to my PSP but I can't get it to play anything so both of these are still a work in progress right now anyways if you're interested in the link I will post it in the chat room sweet

1469
02:08:37,230 --> 02:08:37,631
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that it?

1470
02:08:38,853 --> 02:08:40,396
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty much it for now.

1471
02:08:40,416 --> 02:08:45,966
[SPEAKER_04]: Other than that, Bill Mysell's back up too.

1472
02:08:45,986 --> 02:08:47,449
[SPEAKER_07]: Are they still begging for money?

1473
02:08:48,671 --> 02:08:48,992
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure.

1474
02:08:50,673 --> 02:08:54,914
[SPEAKER_04]: No, they're putting up more media stuff right now, like sim file stuff.

1475
02:08:55,715 --> 02:08:56,135
[SPEAKER_06]: Good times.

1476
02:08:57,675 --> 02:09:02,597
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I forgot to check and see if they had more sim files up there for Max Remix.

1477
02:09:02,797 --> 02:09:03,217
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, goody.

1478
02:09:03,497 --> 02:09:05,137
[SPEAKER_07]: This is what the world needs, more Max Remixes.

1479
02:09:05,418 --> 02:09:10,099
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think that their sim files are up quite yet, but I'm sure that pretty soon they will be.

1480
02:09:10,619 --> 02:09:16,324
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that actually you can go on ddrmaniax.net.

1481
02:09:16,364 --> 02:09:21,969
[SPEAKER_04]: They have a build in progress right now for Step Mania 4, which is almost done.

1482
02:09:22,850 --> 02:09:24,151
[SPEAKER_04]: So that should be pretty cool.

1483
02:09:25,192 --> 02:09:31,257
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, sim file database, not too much right now for that.

1484
02:09:32,598 --> 02:09:36,822
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm thinking though, I mean they've already got some rave songs in there and

1485
02:09:38,618 --> 02:09:41,820
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure there'll be Max remixes in here pretty soon.

1486
02:09:41,840 --> 02:09:42,200
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, wait a minute.

1487
02:09:42,220 --> 02:09:44,561
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought my style was going to have this whole new look when it came back.

1488
02:09:44,601 --> 02:09:45,261
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks the same.

1489
02:09:46,262 --> 02:09:47,402
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, apparently not.

1490
02:09:47,963 --> 02:09:56,147
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently they lied to us, much like they lied to me when I donated money and said I was going to get special access to an FTP site that never happened.

1491
02:09:56,807 --> 02:09:58,748
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's why I never donate to them.

1492
02:09:58,868 --> 02:09:59,448
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, here we go.

1493
02:09:59,628 --> 02:10:00,309
[SPEAKER_04]: Rave Unlimited.

1494
02:10:00,429 --> 02:10:00,889
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

1495
02:10:01,069 --> 02:10:03,110
[SPEAKER_04]: Max Unlimited remix.

1496
02:10:03,190 --> 02:10:04,011
[SPEAKER_06]: Just what the world needs.

1497
02:10:05,131 --> 02:10:05,932
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, um...

1498
02:10:09,454 --> 02:10:14,816
[SPEAKER_07]: Now we're going to get to the part of the show where we ask our buddy Xtifer to come on and tell us about the movies.

1499
02:10:14,836 --> 02:10:15,796
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you see a movie this week?

1500
02:10:16,396 --> 02:10:17,357
[SPEAKER_07]: I did see a movie this week.

1501
02:10:17,397 --> 02:10:20,078
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, then you know it's time for Xtifer's movie review.

1502
02:10:20,858 --> 02:10:27,320
[SPEAKER_08]: The captain, the captain, the captain.

1503
02:10:27,340 --> 02:10:27,800
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

1504
02:10:27,900 --> 02:10:30,261
[SPEAKER_08]: I just wanted to go, like, stop it.

1505
02:10:30,301 --> 02:10:31,141
[SPEAKER_08]: Stop playing that song.

1506
02:10:31,421 --> 02:10:31,721
[SPEAKER_08]: Stop it.

1507
02:10:33,102 --> 02:10:34,302
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, so what did you see this week?

1508
02:10:35,223 --> 02:10:36,603
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so I saw Saw 2.

1509
02:10:40,257 --> 02:11:06,660
[SPEAKER_08]: and um it was bloody if you like blood and if you like to be scared then Saw 2 is the movie to see I really was scared I was genuinely scared at this movie um I'm easily scared though at films so I mean just don't take that from me I mean you may want to take a look at the reviews on RottenTomato.com it got like really horrible reviews um I don't know I it's I've never seen Saw 1

1510
02:11:08,652 --> 02:11:15,256
[SPEAKER_08]: So, um, I've never, I never saw that, um, although I want to see, I want a seesaw for Christmas.

1511
02:11:16,397 --> 02:11:22,000
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, so, but no, it's, it was really, um, cool.

1512
02:11:22,020 --> 02:11:28,905
[SPEAKER_08]: My sister saw the first one, and, um, she had, uh, told, filled me in on most of the first one before we saw the film.

1513
02:11:29,325 --> 02:11:34,428
[SPEAKER_08]: But I didn't expect the beginning, I just did, like, my mouth was open, I was just like, I was horrified.

1514
02:11:34,528 --> 02:11:36,089
[SPEAKER_08]: It was, it was really scary to me.

1515
02:11:36,738 --> 02:11:41,102
[SPEAKER_08]: But again, I'm kind of a pussy when it comes to scary movies.

1516
02:11:41,543 --> 02:11:42,343
[SPEAKER_08]: Rob, you should know that.

1517
02:11:42,463 --> 02:11:43,524
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god, yes.

1518
02:11:43,645 --> 02:11:44,205
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god.

1519
02:11:44,365 --> 02:11:47,188
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm surprised you don't wet your pants at this movie.

1520
02:11:47,728 --> 02:11:49,270
[SPEAKER_08]: I've never told you if I have or not.

1521
02:11:49,370 --> 02:11:50,071
[SPEAKER_08]: I might have.

1522
02:11:50,711 --> 02:11:51,332
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm kidding.

1523
02:11:52,233 --> 02:11:53,314
[SPEAKER_08]: No, not really.

1524
02:11:54,114 --> 02:11:54,675
[SPEAKER_08]: I am...

1525
02:11:55,819 --> 02:11:57,120
[SPEAKER_08]: Kind of impressed by it.

1526
02:11:57,200 --> 02:11:58,521
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought it was like Silent Hill.

1527
02:11:58,641 --> 02:12:03,925
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought it looked like the look and feel of Silent Hill, the way that it was all set up and everything.

1528
02:12:04,085 --> 02:12:07,788
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, the other thing about this movie is that it seems incredibly, extremely, and horribly violent.

1529
02:12:07,988 --> 02:12:09,729
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, seriously violent.

1530
02:12:09,849 --> 02:12:11,350
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, fucking violent.

1531
02:12:12,071 --> 02:12:14,913
[SPEAKER_08]: It is very violent, and people bleeding all over the place.

1532
02:12:15,253 --> 02:12:21,178
[SPEAKER_08]: But the way the place looks is just exactly like something you see right out of that video game.

1533
02:12:22,359 --> 02:12:24,040
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just was very...

1534
02:12:24,941 --> 02:12:27,222
[SPEAKER_08]: Very, like, just, it was just hard to watch.

1535
02:12:27,242 --> 02:12:29,823
[SPEAKER_07]: Why don't you tell me something about, like, a trap?

1536
02:12:30,243 --> 02:12:36,105
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if it's a spoiler, but you were saying, like, a trap where razor blades are cutting off somebody's arm or something.

1537
02:12:36,305 --> 02:12:50,469
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, there's, like, a plexiglass box with two openings, and, you see, the whole premise is these people are poisoned, and they have to find their antidotes to this toxin that they've been breathing in for, like, you know, the last two hours.

1538
02:12:51,400 --> 02:13:13,529
[SPEAKER_08]: and they're trying to find them throughout this house and one of the girls walks into a room with this plexiglass box like hanging from the ceiling with two openings where hands can go through and an antidote like a syringe is in the middle just standing up and she, they're all, you know, totally No, no.

1539
02:13:13,549 --> 02:13:14,029
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

1540
02:13:14,049 --> 02:13:15,649
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, long story short, bloody.

1541
02:13:16,170 --> 02:13:16,910
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no.

1542
02:13:17,370 --> 02:13:19,572
[SPEAKER_08]: Jamie's about to die from my story.

1543
02:13:19,612 --> 02:13:21,293
[SPEAKER_10]: How does it fucking feel to want?

1544
02:13:23,194 --> 02:13:25,055
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, it's my review, damn it.

1545
02:13:26,977 --> 02:13:30,499
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I, um, bloody, bloody, etc.

1546
02:13:30,839 --> 02:13:33,401
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, that's pretty much, I'll talk about it tomorrow.

1547
02:13:33,461 --> 02:13:34,162
[SPEAKER_08]: How's about that?

1548
02:13:35,042 --> 02:13:35,343
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1549
02:13:35,803 --> 02:13:38,705
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't listen to my show tomorrow, DarkSakura, or Jamie.

1550
02:13:39,807 --> 02:14:08,558
[SPEAKER_08]: but uh... no but listen because you know you want to uh... and uh... so I actually recommend it I mean if you don't like if you like um... violence to the level of pornography level it wasn't but the thing is I didn't really pay attention to the blood I was genuinely so if you like the guinea pig project you'll like Saw 2 if you like the I've never seen the guinea pig if you like Faces of Death you'll probably like Saw 2 no no no no no it was more scary than gory to me I mean sure there was blood

1551
02:14:09,378 --> 02:14:11,043
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a good Halloween movie.

1552
02:14:18,103 --> 02:14:19,103
[SPEAKER_08]: Happy Halloween!

1553
02:14:19,143 --> 02:14:19,944
[SPEAKER_08]: Thumbs up?

1554
02:14:20,604 --> 02:14:21,704
[SPEAKER_08]: Thumbs up for me.

1555
02:14:21,724 --> 02:14:23,084
[SPEAKER_08]: Thumbs cut off.

1556
02:14:23,104 --> 02:14:25,645
[SPEAKER_08]: Two stumps up.

1557
02:14:26,646 --> 02:14:27,026
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

1558
02:14:28,546 --> 02:14:39,849
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, we're going to go to another break and in this break we're going to hear some stuff from, since one of our callers earlier brought up DDR with Mario, I suppose we could do some music from DDR with Mario.

1559
02:14:40,210 --> 02:14:44,391
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll do that and we'll be back with more Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

1560
02:14:45,522 --> 02:14:47,664
[SPEAKER_07]: and maybe some more Skype calls if we can get into it.

1561
02:14:47,724 --> 02:14:51,927
[SPEAKER_07]: We also definitely have to do the FUs of the week and do the cage match winner as well.

1562
02:14:52,247 --> 02:14:54,549
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll be... Number three.

1563
02:14:55,770 --> 02:14:56,470
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see, we'll see.

1564
02:14:57,431 --> 02:15:01,674
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, we'll be back after this with some DDR with Mario music and Orange Lodge Radio.

02:21:13,100 --> 02:21:15,262
[SPEAKER_03]: We put your thing down, flip it, and reverse it.

02:21:16,102 --> 02:21:24,189
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi kids, we're back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1573
02:22:03,321 --> 02:22:04,982
[SPEAKER_08]: Any hints about what's coming up on this week's show?

[SPEAKER_10]: Would you read it with a fox?

1584
02:23:15,197 --> 02:23:18,199
[SPEAKER_08]: I would read it in a box with a fox.

1585
02:23:19,871 --> 02:23:20,651

02:23:21,412 --> 02:23:22,372

1600
02:24:06,980 --> 02:24:08,220
[SPEAKER_07]: So you're off this week, actually, right?

1601
02:24:08,320 --> 02:24:09,221
[SPEAKER_10]: This week I will be off.

1602
02:24:09,621 --> 02:24:11,662
[SPEAKER_10]: Unless I get really bored and then I might do something.

1603
02:24:12,462 --> 02:24:13,082
[SPEAKER_10]: So you never know.

1604
02:24:14,122 --> 02:24:15,963

[SPEAKER_07]: This week's program, I'll have a very special guest on the show.

1607
02:24:40,536 --> 02:24:42,717
[SPEAKER_07]: Rice Princess is coming back on Wednesday.

1608
02:24:43,138 --> 02:24:44,618
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's a Vanilla Sky reunion.

1609
02:24:44,638 --> 02:24:47,080
[SPEAKER_07]: It should be a barrel of monkeys' laughs.

1610
02:24:47,240 --> 02:24:48,020
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be a fun show.

1611
02:24:48,341 --> 02:24:48,801
[SPEAKER_07]: So tune in.

1612
02:24:49,101 --> 02:24:50,022
[SPEAKER_07]: Wednesday night, 7 o'clock.

1613
02:24:51,903 --> 02:24:52,223
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1614
02:24:53,383 --> 02:24:55,245
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, moving on.

1615
02:24:55,865 --> 02:24:56,405
[SPEAKER_07]: New topic.

1616
02:24:57,206 --> 02:24:57,746
[SPEAKER_07]: Cage match.

1617
02:24:57,766 --> 02:24:59,987
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's talk about who won tonight's cage match.

1618
02:25:00,828 --> 02:25:02,689
[SPEAKER_07]: The winner of tonight's cage match was...

1619
02:25:05,540 --> 02:25:06,021
[SPEAKER_07]: Drumroll.

1620
02:25:06,421 --> 02:25:07,522
[SPEAKER_07]: Extifer, I need a drumroll.

1621
02:25:07,983 --> 02:25:09,405
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1622
02:25:09,825 --> 02:25:14,791
[SPEAKER_07]: Song that won tonight was... Pendulum with Hold Your Color.

1623
02:25:16,714 --> 02:25:17,535
[SPEAKER_07]: Fourth week.

1624
02:25:18,736 --> 02:25:19,397
[SPEAKER_08]: Retired.

1625
02:25:20,498 --> 02:25:21,019
[SPEAKER_08]: Retired!

1626
02:25:23,339 --> 02:25:24,600
[SPEAKER_08]: That is so sad.

1627
02:25:24,660 --> 02:25:27,981
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, you guys, don't you guys care about Captain Jack?

1628
02:25:28,481 --> 02:25:30,062
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, didn't he die for you?

1629
02:25:31,282 --> 02:25:32,503
[SPEAKER_08]: Didn't he die for your sins?

1630
02:25:33,483 --> 02:25:35,004
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe.

1631
02:25:35,044 --> 02:25:36,604
[SPEAKER_08]: Isn't he going to be coming back soon?

1632
02:25:37,665 --> 02:25:38,245
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, come on.

1633
02:25:38,625 --> 02:25:39,386
[SPEAKER_08]: Come on, people.

1634
02:25:39,686 --> 02:25:39,966
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1635
02:25:40,686 --> 02:25:41,306
[SPEAKER_07]: Get off the show.

1636
02:25:41,326 --> 02:25:41,687
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm kidding.

1637
02:25:43,127 --> 02:25:44,788
[SPEAKER_07]: Stop gaying up the show, Extover.

1638
02:25:45,308 --> 02:25:46,469
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I'm sorry, Rob.

1639
02:25:46,969 --> 02:25:47,409
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay?

1640
02:25:47,789 --> 02:25:48,950
[SPEAKER_07]: But I thought he was fabulous.

1641
02:25:51,330 --> 02:25:52,371
[SPEAKER_07]: Here, Loki, here's your mic.

1642
02:25:53,732 --> 02:25:54,932
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just kidding, you don't have to leave.

1643
02:25:55,793 --> 02:25:56,133
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1644
02:25:56,933 --> 02:25:57,713
[SPEAKER_10]: That was great.

1645
02:25:59,434 --> 02:25:59,734
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

1646
02:26:01,095 --> 02:26:01,895
[SPEAKER_07]: So there it is, four weeks ago.

1647
02:26:01,915 --> 02:26:02,835
[SPEAKER_10]: This show needs more gay.

1648
02:26:03,155 --> 02:26:04,776
[SPEAKER_07]: Three new songs.

1649
02:26:04,856 --> 02:26:07,257
[SPEAKER_07]: New, new, newbie, new, newbian songs next week.

1650
02:26:08,953 --> 02:26:10,074
[SPEAKER_07]: I already know what song I'm putting in.

1651
02:26:10,114 --> 02:26:13,296
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not allowing Miklatov to pick my song next week.

1652
02:26:13,596 --> 02:26:16,338
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, is he on?

1653
02:26:17,038 --> 02:26:22,062
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to see if he's on AIM right now, because I might send him a message letting him know.

1654
02:26:22,102 --> 02:26:25,424
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I know if he is online, he's too good to be listening to this program.

1655
02:26:26,685 --> 02:26:29,006
[SPEAKER_07]: But I want to let him know that he won.

1656
02:26:29,687 --> 02:26:30,768
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, he's not online right now.

1657
02:26:30,808 --> 02:26:31,128
[SPEAKER_07]: Denied.

1658
02:26:33,595 --> 02:26:33,875
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura

1659
02:27:01,436 --> 02:27:03,976
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, why is it that we do the FUs of the week every single week?

1660
02:27:08,598 --> 02:27:10,699
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I like this.

1661
02:27:10,719 --> 02:27:11,759
[SPEAKER_07]: This is video game sounding.

1662
02:27:14,940 --> 02:27:16,981
[SPEAKER_07]: Burn, fire, kill, die, burn.

1663
02:27:17,021 --> 02:27:18,041
[SPEAKER_10]: Dude, it's sports fun.

1664
02:27:18,081 --> 02:27:18,721
[SPEAKER_10]: They're pretty cool.

1665
02:27:18,882 --> 02:27:19,682
[SPEAKER_10]: I might change it, though.

1666
02:27:21,485 --> 02:27:23,387
[SPEAKER_10]: But, um, my first F.U.

1667
02:27:23,427 --> 02:27:24,447
[SPEAKER_10]: goes to the cage match.

1668
02:27:25,969 --> 02:27:26,990
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, my second F.U.

1669
02:27:27,070 --> 02:27:28,791
[SPEAKER_10]: goes toward, uh, Captain Jack.

1670
02:27:30,092 --> 02:27:30,653
[SPEAKER_10]: For dying.

1671
02:27:31,253 --> 02:27:31,894
[SPEAKER_10]: How dare he?

1672
02:27:31,914 --> 02:27:41,682
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, no, this isn't Schlagwort, it's Schwarzstein.

1673
02:27:43,360 --> 02:27:45,781
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, another F you goes to being tired.

1674
02:27:47,061 --> 02:27:55,063
[SPEAKER_10]: And, uh, another F you goes toward basically being flaked on by people.

1675
02:27:57,204 --> 02:27:59,604
[SPEAKER_10]: As I look across the room and I'll say that.

1676
02:28:01,045 --> 02:28:02,325
[SPEAKER_10]: I flaked on you, I'm sorry.

1677
02:28:02,645 --> 02:28:03,505
[SPEAKER_10]: I forgot to call you.

1678
02:28:04,406 --> 02:28:07,987
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I went to Red Lobster.

1679
02:28:08,407 --> 02:28:12,908
[SPEAKER_10]: F you to Red Lobster for your tasty food that made me

1680
02:28:14,429 --> 02:28:22,454
[SPEAKER_10]: My first FU goes to the goddamn slow people that have to be in front of me every time I go out driving.

1681
02:28:39,110 --> 02:28:43,212
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's just really retarded people out there that just don't pay attention.

1682
02:28:43,272 --> 02:28:45,394
[SPEAKER_04]: It's always women on their goddamn cell phones.

1683
02:28:45,794 --> 02:28:55,680
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, I have given you plenty of chances to, you know, redeem yourself, but everywhere I look, there's a goddamn woman on her cell phone driving a stupid SUV, nearly hitting something.

1684
02:28:56,360 --> 02:28:56,980
[SPEAKER_04]: All the time.

1685
02:28:57,521 --> 02:29:01,023
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, literally, you cannot go outside without seeing something like that.

1686
02:29:01,883 --> 02:29:02,323
[SPEAKER_04]: It's crazy.

1687
02:29:02,764 --> 02:29:04,445
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you know what SUV stands for.

1688
02:29:05,625 --> 02:29:08,067
[SPEAKER_10]: The Stupid Useless Vehicle for Stupid Useless People.

1689
02:29:11,798 --> 02:29:33,122
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, um, so, fuck them, cause they suck, and, also, uh, fuck the fact that I haven't had any time playing more Final Fantasy, um, really getting behind on that, and trying to cram more minutes into the day is just not working, so, yeah, it sucks, um, also, in general, just, um,

1690
02:29:34,633 --> 02:29:38,615
[SPEAKER_04]: And also, fuck those stupid people on Craigslist that want to charge $135 for a web page design, and

1691
02:29:54,585 --> 02:29:55,685
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, maybe I should... I'm done.

1692
02:30:20,540 --> 02:30:22,741
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm gonna do a new FU song as well tonight, I think.

1693
02:30:23,762 --> 02:30:24,242
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm keeping mine.

1694
02:30:24,262 --> 02:30:25,503
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, that's fine.

1695
02:30:25,683 --> 02:30:26,124
[SPEAKER_07]: I like yours.

1696
02:30:26,664 --> 02:30:26,984
[SPEAKER_06]: For now.

1697
02:30:27,144 --> 02:30:27,845
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm gonna change mine.

1698
02:30:32,228 --> 02:30:37,831
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I'd like to give an FU, um, oh, cute, I like that.

1699
02:30:38,872 --> 02:30:41,614
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, I'd like to give an FU to our, um, apartment complex.

1700
02:30:42,981 --> 02:30:51,470
[SPEAKER_07]: Because our apartment complex, I called them on Monday to tell them that the washer in the apartment was broken, and it took them until today to just bring them a new washer.

1701
02:30:51,490 --> 02:30:52,972
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know why it finally happened today?

1702
02:30:53,232 --> 02:30:56,055
[SPEAKER_07]: Because when I called the office, I actually got to speak to the general manager.

1703
02:30:56,335 --> 02:30:57,937
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's the only reason it got taken care of today.

1704
02:30:58,217 --> 02:30:59,959
[SPEAKER_08]: She had my problem fixed in five minutes.

1705
02:31:00,740 --> 02:31:02,862
[SPEAKER_08]: Seriously, it was just, it was a nightmare.

1706
02:31:02,902 --> 02:31:04,604
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know, not having a washer...

1707
02:31:05,553 --> 02:31:08,735
[SPEAKER_08]: is just plain fucking insane.

1708
02:31:09,415 --> 02:31:13,217
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to, like, rely on your friends to have time to let you use their washer.

1709
02:31:13,757 --> 02:31:13,997
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1710
02:31:14,137 --> 02:31:20,640
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, because I'm not going to go to no laundromat or whatever to spend money and wash and dry my clothes.

1711
02:31:21,100 --> 02:31:21,400
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyways.

1712
02:31:22,081 --> 02:31:23,641
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

1713
02:31:26,222 --> 02:31:31,805
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's, um, I think that's pretty much my major FU, otherwise FU to the fact that I am going to have

1714
02:31:33,430 --> 02:31:35,993
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm gonna be so, so busy at work in the next couple weeks.

1715
02:31:36,073 --> 02:31:36,654
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm gonna cry.

1716
02:31:36,794 --> 02:31:37,595
[SPEAKER_10]: I have another one, Rob.

1717
02:31:37,715 --> 02:31:38,395
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, but that's alright.

1718
02:31:38,796 --> 02:31:39,236
[SPEAKER_07]: What can you do?

1719
02:31:39,677 --> 02:31:42,680
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, then let's go back to Jamie's music so she can get her last FU up.

1720
02:31:42,960 --> 02:31:47,265
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, my last FU is to myself for leaving directions to somewhere at home, so I have to get back to them.

1721
02:31:47,966 --> 02:31:48,206
[SPEAKER_07]: Dope.

1722
02:31:49,427 --> 02:31:52,290
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, let's go and check out some of our guest FUs.

1723
02:31:52,351 --> 02:31:53,372
[SPEAKER_07]: Started off with DDR Angel.

1724
02:31:54,059 --> 02:32:07,633
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I usually don't bitch about a game, per se, or what happened in the game, but this one redeems itself, you see, because usually you go into a group and hopefully good things happen and you level and blah blah blah, whatever.

1725
02:32:07,913 --> 02:32:09,354
[SPEAKER_10]: This guy was a complete butthead, though.

1726
02:32:09,995 --> 02:32:33,057
[SPEAKER_10]: because as soon as I rolled on the object that I needed, he was like, you don't need that, you're a priest, so you know what, fuck you, and fuck you to kicking me out of the group after you didn't get your way, I mean, it was just massive monster player kill, go in the middle of the mob, run out, and kill the priest, fuck you, and that's

1727
02:32:33,578 --> 02:32:36,342
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks to her, you're FUs of the week.

1728
02:32:48,159 --> 02:32:53,784
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, FU to working for a living.

1729
02:32:53,984 --> 02:32:56,086
[SPEAKER_08]: I second DarkSakura's FU.

1730
02:32:56,606 --> 02:33:01,170
[SPEAKER_08]: I went and applied for another job today, so maybe I'll have two.

1731
02:33:02,531 --> 02:33:04,192
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, I don't know.

1732
02:33:04,232 --> 02:33:09,497
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, I'm just not looking forward to working two jobs, especially the job that I applied for is retail.

1733
02:33:10,337 --> 02:33:11,939
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm the retail king.

1734
02:33:11,959 --> 02:33:14,921
[SPEAKER_08]: But you're going to work at my favorite store and you can get me discounts.

1735
02:33:14,961 --> 02:33:15,602
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm so excited.

1736
02:33:15,722 --> 02:33:17,223
[SPEAKER_08]: That's fucking great.

1737
02:33:18,044 --> 02:33:18,484
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, for you.

1738
02:33:19,324 --> 02:33:22,445
[SPEAKER_08]: I, on the other hand, am not really happy for it.

1739
02:33:22,585 --> 02:33:24,425
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, I mean, it's cool.

1740
02:33:24,445 --> 02:33:26,626
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I just need the extra money.

1741
02:33:26,926 --> 02:33:29,546
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I mean, in the long run, it'll be good for me.

1742
02:33:29,646 --> 02:33:32,487
[SPEAKER_08]: But at the same time, fuck you to working for a living.

1743
02:33:34,247 --> 02:33:35,127
[SPEAKER_10]: I forgot something.

1744
02:33:35,247 --> 02:33:36,227
[SPEAKER_10]: Ow, I just hurt myself.

1745
02:33:36,828 --> 02:33:40,908
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, fuck you to not having enough time to do artwork and play video games.

1746
02:33:40,988 --> 02:33:41,689
[SPEAKER_10]: That just sucks.

1747
02:33:42,489 --> 02:33:44,109
[SPEAKER_08]: Manwhore's getting too expensive, Christopher.

1748
02:33:46,960 --> 02:33:55,788
[SPEAKER_08]: They are, I mean, you know, and I pay the extra so that I can, you know, suck their assholes Oh my god!

1749
02:33:56,048 --> 02:34:10,761
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, that's like 120 bucks extra You're cut off, shut up I'm sorry, but, you know, but, you know, I think that it's a really horrible thing when you have to charge extra for that

1750
02:34:12,045 --> 02:34:13,326
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I please go to the chatroom?

1751
02:34:13,346 --> 02:34:15,207
[SPEAKER_08]: It's all just jokes, people.

1752
02:34:15,367 --> 02:34:17,188
[SPEAKER_08]: It's okay to have sexual humor.

1753
02:34:17,208 --> 02:34:18,809
[SPEAKER_08]: I saw some people in the chatroom earlier.

1754
02:34:19,169 --> 02:34:20,910
[SPEAKER_08]: It's okay, just get over it.

1755
02:34:23,192 --> 02:34:25,813
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not gonna change, so, you know, leave if you don't like it.

1756
02:34:26,874 --> 02:34:31,777
[SPEAKER_04]: The views and opinions expressed by Xifer are not necessarily that of the show's.

1757
02:34:32,337 --> 02:34:35,119
[SPEAKER_07]: Misty says, fuck my schedule for work this week.

1758
02:34:35,159 --> 02:34:40,502
[SPEAKER_07]: Of all the weeks that I could go in later because my mom's on vacation this week, I get scheduled for 8am or earlier.

1759
02:34:43,398 --> 02:34:46,719
[SPEAKER_07]: John Field says, F you to my car which has it's speedometer messed up.

[SPEAKER_07]: It says 55 and police gun says 45.

1761
02:34:49,501 --> 02:34:51,582
[SPEAKER_07]: Does anyone know where to take this thing to get it fixed?

1762
02:34:51,622 --> 02:34:54,243
[SPEAKER_07]: I've gone to the local Acura repair shop and they can't fix it.

1763
02:34:55,764 --> 02:34:58,225
[SPEAKER_07]: So fuck them for not being able to fix their own cars.

1764
02:34:59,766 --> 02:35:02,908
[SPEAKER_07]: Goggle says, um, oh.

1773
02:35:28,432 --> 02:35:32,613
[SPEAKER_07]: People can have mental issues at times instead of just being lazy for now.

1774
02:35:33,493 --> 02:35:38,914
[SPEAKER_07]: F you to Etel for having a crappy DSL connection when I was trying to make my Skype call that couldn't even be considered a call.

1775
02:35:38,954 --> 02:35:39,914

02:38:00,345 --> 02:38:00,625
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1801
02:38:00,666 --> 02:38:02,827
[SPEAKER_07]: Who told her she could put out one, let alone two?

1802
02:38:02,847 --> 02:38:03,447
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know.

1803
02:38:04,088 --> 02:38:04,368
[SPEAKER_07]: Bitch.

1804
02:38:04,994 --> 02:38:08,117
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you hear that she's going to be making indie films now to get some street cred?

1805
02:38:08,618 --> 02:38:09,899
[SPEAKER_07]: She signed up with some indie films.

1806
02:38:10,339 --> 02:38:11,500
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe she'll die.

1807
02:38:11,901 --> 02:38:15,384
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully those indie films that are porn will involve lots of nudity.

1808
02:38:15,865 --> 02:38:16,465
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that what you want?

1809
02:38:16,665 --> 02:38:19,528
[SPEAKER_08]: I think she should do a remake of the Captain Jack song we heard tonight.

1810
02:38:20,569 --> 02:38:20,929
[SPEAKER_08]: You think so?

1811
02:38:21,170 --> 02:38:21,590
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I do.

1812
02:38:21,610 --> 02:38:22,271
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be good times.

1813
02:38:23,556 --> 02:38:35,931
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, um, we're gonna do, um, actually we're gonna go to one more break, but there's a purpose behind this break, because I wanted to play this for you guys tonight at some point, um, because I just got this, um, from our buddy Miklatov, and he says it's very cool, and I want to play it for you guys.

1814
02:38:36,392 --> 02:38:41,238
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, it's in the Kiriyama Oka track, it's actually System Romance, but it's not the song that we know it from 2DX.

1815
02:38:42,159 --> 02:38:42,339
[SPEAKER_07]: More news!

1816
02:38:42,359 --> 02:38:42,539
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1817
02:39:01,499 --> 02:39:02,720
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, more news than it is.

1818
02:39:03,321 --> 02:39:05,803
[SPEAKER_07]: And maybe some Ask Orange Lounge if we have time?

1819
02:39:05,983 --> 02:39:06,163
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

1820
02:39:06,383 --> 02:39:07,664
[SPEAKER_07]: If we have time, but we don't know tonight.

1821
02:39:07,704 --> 02:39:09,086
[SPEAKER_07]: Tonight, we may not get to do it.

1822
02:39:09,486 --> 02:39:10,627
[SPEAKER_07]: So, anyway, here we go.

1823
02:39:10,647 --> 02:39:13,469
[SPEAKER_07]: Akira Yamaoka with a guitar version of Sister Romance.

1824
02:39:13,570 --> 02:39:13,770
[SPEAKER_07]: Enjoy.

1825
02:39:31,113 --> 02:39:31,675
Thanks for watching!

1826
02:41:24,479 --> 02:41:25,184
Thanks for watching!

1827
02:41:52,592 --> 02:41:54,875
Thanks for watching!

1828
02:42:58,054 --> 02:42:59,124
Thanks for watching!

1829
02:43:24,865 --> 02:43:25,387
DJ Ranma S

1830
02:44:11,363 --> 02:44:15,244
[SPEAKER_07]: Akira Yamaoka with an instrumental version of System Romance.

1831
02:44:15,904 --> 02:44:22,685
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I promised somebody that we could do one more call over the Skype line, so we're going to go ahead and go to the Skype line for one last call before we get to some more news.

1832
02:44:23,045 --> 02:44:23,985
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1833
02:44:25,266 --> 02:44:26,366
[SPEAKER_26]: Hey, Sky, it's John Field.

1834
02:44:26,946 --> 02:44:27,826
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, John, what's on your mind?

1835
02:44:29,507 --> 02:44:30,247
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm doing okay.

1836
02:44:31,567 --> 02:44:32,467
[SPEAKER_07]: What's on your mind tonight?

1837
02:44:33,747 --> 02:44:35,928
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, I've got a pretty big amount to make.

1838
02:44:36,248 --> 02:44:36,588
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1839
02:44:37,999 --> 02:44:45,923
[SPEAKER_26]: A couple months back, I made an announcement on Orange Lounge Radio, the official announcement about it, that I would be starting up a Phantasy Star Online Mishima.

1840
02:44:46,563 --> 02:44:46,963
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, okay.

1841
02:44:48,083 --> 02:44:49,444
[SPEAKER_26]: And I've got good news about that.

1842
02:44:51,245 --> 02:44:55,667
[SPEAKER_26]: The first episode will be released tomorrow, and I'll be posting a link to it in the chat room.

1843
02:44:56,527 --> 02:44:57,147
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, very cool.

1844
02:44:57,187 --> 02:45:00,189
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, explain for those that might not know, what is a Mishima?

1845
02:45:01,309 --> 02:45:05,611
[SPEAKER_26]: A Mishima is basically the idea of taking a video game, using the characters in it,

1846
02:45:06,444 --> 02:45:10,826
[SPEAKER_26]: and using that to tell a story that's different from what the actual game is like.

1847
02:45:10,846 --> 02:45:13,647
[SPEAKER_26]: Sort of like what Red vs. Blue did for Halo.

1848
02:45:13,847 --> 02:45:18,669
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, and I remember I saw a commercial on TV the other day that was The Sims 2, and it was a very similar kind of thing.

1849
02:45:18,769 --> 02:45:24,091
[SPEAKER_07]: So a lot of folks like that Red vs. Blue stuff, so now you made one for Phantasy Star Online.

1850
02:45:25,052 --> 02:45:25,272
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah.

1851
02:45:25,532 --> 02:45:25,932
[SPEAKER_07]: Very cool.

1852
02:45:25,952 --> 02:45:26,412
[SPEAKER_07]: What's it called?

1853
02:45:27,693 --> 02:45:31,915
[SPEAKER_26]: It's called The Monster Within, and the first episode, like I said, will be out tomorrow.

1854
02:45:32,175 --> 02:45:32,355
[SPEAKER_07]: Mm-hmm.

1855
02:45:33,149 --> 02:45:36,312
[SPEAKER_26]: If it's not up on Archive.org, I'll be hosting it on my own web space.

1856
02:45:36,732 --> 02:45:36,972
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

1857
02:45:37,452 --> 02:45:43,557
[SPEAKER_26]: And hopefully this will be maybe every few weeks or so, I'll have another release out.

1858
02:45:43,838 --> 02:45:46,279
[SPEAKER_07]: Give us a little hint as to the plot of the first episode.

1859
02:45:47,741 --> 02:45:52,104
[SPEAKER_26]: The plot of the first episode is sort of, it takes place before the actual game starts.

1860
02:45:52,164 --> 02:45:56,067
[SPEAKER_26]: It's sort of like you're there seeing the explosion on Red Gold.

1861
02:45:56,728 --> 02:45:56,948
[SPEAKER_07]: Hmm.

1862
02:45:57,898 --> 02:46:00,398
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so a little bit of a prequel going on here.

1863
02:46:00,719 --> 02:46:03,099
[SPEAKER_07]: You going to send this to some folks at Sega, see what they think of it?

1864
02:46:04,439 --> 02:46:08,020
[SPEAKER_26]: Actually, I'm already working with a contact inside Sega.

1865
02:46:08,100 --> 02:46:10,400
[SPEAKER_26]: It's the GM for Blueburst, Clumsy Orchid.

1866
02:46:10,800 --> 02:46:11,160
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

1867
02:46:11,260 --> 02:46:12,040
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, good luck with that.

1868
02:46:12,080 --> 02:46:13,321
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope you have a good time.

1869
02:46:13,381 --> 02:46:15,421
[SPEAKER_07]: And hey, name drop Orin's mom's name somewhere, okay?

1870
02:46:16,581 --> 02:46:16,881
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

1871
02:46:16,901 --> 02:46:17,501
[SPEAKER_07]: Just messing with you.

1872
02:46:17,521 --> 02:46:18,382
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, have a good one.

1873
02:46:18,402 --> 02:46:19,622
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for, and good luck with that.

1874
02:46:19,662 --> 02:46:20,262
[SPEAKER_07]: Let us know how it does.

1875
02:46:20,502 --> 02:46:22,042
[SPEAKER_07]: And post the link in the chat room so we can check it out.

1876
02:46:22,982 --> 02:46:23,162
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

1877
02:46:23,342 --> 02:46:23,603
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1878
02:46:24,043 --> 02:46:24,343
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1879
02:46:24,523 --> 02:46:24,823
[SPEAKER_07]: Later.

1880
02:46:25,763 --> 02:46:25,983
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye.

1881
02:46:26,063 --> 02:46:26,243
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye.

1882
02:46:27,449 --> 02:46:27,849
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1883
02:46:29,349 --> 02:46:30,310
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are always a good time.

1884
02:46:30,610 --> 02:46:41,932
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I forgot to ask if it was going to be like a comedy or a drama kind of thing, because, you know, Red vs. Blue is funny stuff, but the way that kind of sounded, it sounded like it might be a more serious thing, so hopefully it's a little bit of both, though.

1885
02:46:41,972 --> 02:46:42,593
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are the best.

1886
02:46:42,793 --> 02:46:44,253
[SPEAKER_07]: A little bit of both is always a good time.

1887
02:46:44,853 --> 02:46:49,414
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, Loki said he had some news for us, so I want to go ahead and let him have a chance to talk about some news.

1888
02:46:49,774 --> 02:46:52,495
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think I have something else, too, so we got a lot of news here in the last 15 minutes.

1889
02:46:53,584 --> 02:47:09,461
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, anyways, um, stuff I was going to be talking about, um, and we posted this to the site earlier this week about this new dance game that's coming out by the creators of Get on the Mic, and it actually used to be called Get on the Floor, but now it's Flow, the Urban Dance Uprising.

1890
02:47:10,522 --> 02:47:12,064
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, this game is...

1891
02:47:12,642 --> 02:47:14,783
[SPEAKER_06]: The Urban Dance Uprising.

1892
02:47:14,843 --> 02:47:16,284
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Dance Uprising.

1893
02:47:16,304 --> 02:47:19,125
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, you know, Uprising is like a revolution, I guess.

1894
02:47:20,366 --> 02:47:21,727
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's basically DDR.

1895
02:47:22,067 --> 02:47:23,848
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, in every sense.

1896
02:47:24,208 --> 02:47:28,470
[SPEAKER_04]: It is so much like DDR that I'm sure we'll see the lawsuit in a few months here.

1897
02:47:28,550 --> 02:47:30,991
[SPEAKER_04]: But what can I say?

1898
02:47:31,031 --> 02:47:33,032
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all breakbeat music, which is kind of cool.

1899
02:47:33,652 --> 02:47:35,233
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got some pretty good tracks in it.

1900
02:47:35,253 --> 02:47:40,196
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of them I didn't recognize because, I mean, I like breakbeat and stuff, but I don't really...

1901
02:47:41,499 --> 02:47:42,440
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

1902
02:47:56,241 --> 02:48:06,067
[SPEAKER_04]: But two of the main songs I wanted to mention was The Breaks by Curtis Blow and 8th Wonder by Sugar Hill Gang, which are going to be two of the big songs in it.

1903
02:48:06,408 --> 02:48:06,948
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

1904
02:48:07,008 --> 02:48:08,809
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's basically VDR.

1905
02:48:09,329 --> 02:48:10,210
[SPEAKER_04]: Very, very similar.

1906
02:48:12,371 --> 02:48:14,192
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was the one I wanted to mention.

1907
02:48:14,833 --> 02:48:19,396
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that was the only story I had, if I remember correctly.

1908
02:48:20,316 --> 02:48:20,536
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1909
02:48:20,717 --> 02:48:21,257
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1910
02:48:21,497 --> 02:48:22,378
[SPEAKER_04]: Just that dance game.

1911
02:48:23,098 --> 02:48:24,459
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be interesting to check out.

1912
02:48:24,926 --> 02:48:27,449
[SPEAKER_07]: I got a couple other things I want to add, which I think is very interesting.

1913
02:48:27,709 --> 02:48:35,840
[SPEAKER_07]: DDR Freak is reporting this week that Carl's Jr., as we know it here on the West Coast, but on the East Coast they call it Hardee's, but same thing.

1914
02:48:36,120 --> 02:48:42,107
[SPEAKER_07]: They're actually going to be running a promotion this November where DDR is going to be advertised on their drink cups.

1915
02:48:42,827 --> 02:48:43,667
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's very interesting.

1916
02:48:43,727 --> 02:48:58,035
[SPEAKER_07]: On their 44-ounce, like their super drink cups, they're going to advertise like DDR games, which I think is very interesting because you consider the types of things that are usually advertised on the side of fast food drink cups, and it's like, well, Extifer, you drink a lot of fast food cups, so what kind of... I'm just kidding.

1917
02:48:58,375 --> 02:48:59,595
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw you grab the mic.

1918
02:48:59,615 --> 02:49:00,836
[SPEAKER_08]: No, you said Carl's Jr., right?

1919
02:49:00,876 --> 02:49:01,056
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1920
02:49:01,496 --> 02:49:02,737
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I love Carl's Jr.

1921
02:49:02,937 --> 02:49:04,598
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, or Hardee's if you're on the East Coast.

1922
02:49:04,898 --> 02:49:05,398
[SPEAKER_08]: Or Hardee's.

1923
02:49:05,718 --> 02:49:06,259
[SPEAKER_08]: Carl's Jr.

1924
02:49:06,299 --> 02:49:06,959
[SPEAKER_08]: is the best.

1925
02:49:07,637 --> 02:49:08,418
[SPEAKER_08]: It's pretty good.

1926
02:49:08,738 --> 02:49:11,840
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that makes it even better.

1927
02:49:12,120 --> 02:49:15,282
[SPEAKER_07]: You know I once dated somebody who refused to eat at Carl's Jr.

1928
02:49:15,342 --> 02:49:16,583
[SPEAKER_07]: because Carl's Jr.

1929
02:49:16,663 --> 02:49:20,426
[SPEAKER_07]: was giving secret money to anti-gay Republican organizations, supposedly.

1930
02:49:20,728 --> 02:49:24,911
[SPEAKER_08]: Call me Republican and anti-gay because I love Carl's Jr.

1931
02:49:25,411 --> 02:49:30,714
[SPEAKER_08]: Those Western bacons will make me... They are the Western bacon cheeseburger.

1932
02:49:30,794 --> 02:49:36,377
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, so usually they advertise what, like Disney movies on the side of drink cups and whatever else is going on.

1933
02:49:36,998 --> 02:49:39,599
[SPEAKER_07]: But DDR is going to be a promotion at Carl's Jr.

1934
02:49:39,860 --> 02:49:40,800
[SPEAKER_07]: That's very interesting.

1935
02:49:41,080 --> 02:49:41,340
[SPEAKER_04]: It is.

1936
02:49:41,541 --> 02:49:42,101
[SPEAKER_07]: It's interesting.

1937
02:49:42,281 --> 02:49:43,542
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, here's the thing.

1938
02:49:44,302 --> 02:49:48,004
[SPEAKER_07]: Inside the store, there's going to be a big advertising standee and there'll be $5 coupons.

1939
02:49:49,750 --> 02:49:50,650
[SPEAKER_07]: We need a Kiriyamaoka revolution

1940
02:50:11,624 --> 02:50:18,511
[SPEAKER_07]: I keep forgetting that we have international listeners, so they're like, I don't know if it's Canada or what, but somebody's all, we don't have Hardee's here, where?

1941
02:50:18,951 --> 02:50:20,493
[SPEAKER_07]: You're not missing anything, trust me.

1942
02:50:21,113 --> 02:50:22,595
[SPEAKER_04]: Their burgers taste like ass.

1943
02:50:22,675 --> 02:50:23,896
[SPEAKER_10]: Hardee's sells fried chicken.

1944
02:50:25,013 --> 02:50:28,295
[SPEAKER_04]: And they have like, you know, giant sized burgers that taste like ass.

1945
02:50:28,595 --> 02:50:34,258
[SPEAKER_04]: Trust me, I used to like, you know, some of their burgers there, but there's this one Carl's Jr.

1946
02:50:34,298 --> 02:50:38,620
[SPEAKER_04]: that was right by our house and it was really, um, really bad.

1947
02:50:39,060 --> 02:50:46,264
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember probably the pinnacle of their suckiness was when the salt tasted like urine for some reason.

1948
02:50:46,284 --> 02:50:50,406
[SPEAKER_08]: Angel, you'd know about that, right?

1949
02:50:54,307 --> 02:50:54,607
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

1950
02:50:54,768 --> 02:50:55,989
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

1951
02:50:57,370 --> 02:50:57,670
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

1952
02:50:57,750 --> 02:50:59,391
[SPEAKER_10]: Hardee's is cooler than Carl's Jr.

1953
02:50:59,411 --> 02:51:01,253
[SPEAKER_10]: though because they have fried chicken and biscuits.

1954
02:51:03,082 --> 02:51:04,723
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that they're fine.

1955
02:51:05,043 --> 02:51:07,284
[SPEAKER_08]: And if they taste like ass, call me an ass man.

1956
02:51:07,964 --> 02:51:10,225
[SPEAKER_08]: I really like... But, Carl's Jr.

1957
02:51:10,326 --> 02:51:12,286
[SPEAKER_07]: But, Carl's Jr.

1958
02:51:12,346 --> 02:51:14,748
[SPEAKER_07]: has in selected restaurants the green burrito.

1959
02:51:15,528 --> 02:51:16,508
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I don't like green burrito.

1960
02:51:16,648 --> 02:51:17,769
[SPEAKER_08]: But you know what I like?

1961
02:51:17,929 --> 02:51:18,709
[SPEAKER_08]: I like green burrito.

1962
02:51:18,889 --> 02:51:19,470
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I like?

1963
02:51:19,510 --> 02:51:20,850
[SPEAKER_08]: Shut your mouths, women.

1964
02:51:21,090 --> 02:51:28,334
[SPEAKER_08]: My fast food of choice, better than Carl's Jr., though, is Jack in the Box, which I know is also not available in all the states.

1965
02:51:28,974 --> 02:51:29,854
[SPEAKER_10]: Yak in the crack.

1966
02:51:30,395 --> 02:51:31,015
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that's great.

1967
02:51:33,366 --> 02:51:35,287
[SPEAKER_10]: I found out something like a couple weeks ago.

1968
02:51:35,447 --> 02:51:35,667
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

1969
02:51:35,947 --> 02:51:39,129
[SPEAKER_10]: About fast food and... It makes you fat?

1970
02:51:39,209 --> 02:51:40,029
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I do that.

1971
02:51:40,089 --> 02:51:40,650
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, no.

1972
02:51:41,690 --> 02:51:43,191
[SPEAKER_10]: We have a chick-fil-a now.

1973
02:51:43,851 --> 02:51:44,352
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, come on.

1974
02:51:44,552 --> 02:51:45,812
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, big whoop.

1975
02:51:46,173 --> 02:51:46,793
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, hey, hey.

1976
02:51:46,813 --> 02:51:48,774
[SPEAKER_10]: I freaking grew up with a chick-fil-a.

1977
02:51:48,854 --> 02:51:49,914
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, but I didn't.

1978
02:51:50,035 --> 02:51:50,675
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

1979
02:51:50,735 --> 02:51:51,615
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't, but I didn't.

1980
02:51:51,675 --> 02:51:52,256
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

1981
02:51:53,120 --> 02:51:54,201
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck Chick-fil-A.

1982
02:51:54,381 --> 02:51:56,383
[SPEAKER_07]: What's the big deal about Chick-fil-A?

1983
02:51:56,423 --> 02:51:57,984
[SPEAKER_10]: The crack they put in the Polynesian sauce.

1984
02:51:59,325 --> 02:51:59,986
[SPEAKER_10]: I like it.

1985
02:52:00,066 --> 02:52:01,267
[SPEAKER_10]: All Chick-fil-A's are closed on Sunday.

1986
02:52:01,347 --> 02:52:03,569
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, because they're praising Jesus.

1987
02:52:04,335 --> 02:52:08,697
[SPEAKER_10]: But no, I think that it's very admirable that they would take a corporate stance for their beliefs.

1988
02:52:08,837 --> 02:52:12,660
[SPEAKER_07]: I agree, and it's good that the employees at least all get one good day off.

1989
02:52:12,900 --> 02:52:13,640
[SPEAKER_04]: I freaking hate it.

1990
02:52:13,880 --> 02:52:17,562
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, goddamn Tugboat, you know, Fish and Chips, and Nippon.

1991
02:52:17,962 --> 02:52:19,763
[SPEAKER_04]: Both of the places, I love their food.

1992
02:52:19,984 --> 02:52:24,446
[SPEAKER_04]: The only time I really have a chance to get some is on Sundays, and they have to go freaking warship.

1993
02:52:25,166 --> 02:52:28,788
[SPEAKER_04]: They could do that in the morning like normal people, and they come back to work.

1994
02:52:29,469 --> 02:52:33,671
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, some people actually live up to their personal beliefs, maybe.

1995
02:52:34,431 --> 02:52:35,492
[SPEAKER_04]: No one does that anymore.

1996
02:52:36,633 --> 02:52:37,814
[SPEAKER_04]: That's so passe.

1997
02:52:39,535 --> 02:52:43,418
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I have to commend anyone who's willing to take a stance like that for what they believe in.

1998
02:52:43,458 --> 02:52:44,699
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that it's very admirable.

1999
02:52:45,840 --> 02:52:54,327
[SPEAKER_08]: The church crowd, when I used to work at Walmart, when they used to come in, I have horrible stories.

2000
02:52:54,927 --> 02:52:56,368
[SPEAKER_08]: It was the worst crowd in the world.

2001
02:52:57,449 --> 02:53:02,073
[SPEAKER_08]: I swear, you're praising Jesus, and you want, you know, to be saved, and

2002
02:53:02,711 --> 02:53:05,193
[SPEAKER_08]: yet you want to save more money than you want to be saved.

2003
02:53:26,661 --> 02:53:29,143
[SPEAKER_10]: I just said it because I thought you guys missed it or something.

2004
02:53:29,603 --> 02:53:30,243
[SPEAKER_10]: Never mind.

2005
02:53:30,444 --> 02:53:31,204
[SPEAKER_07]: My aim's improving.

2006
02:53:32,965 --> 02:53:36,948
[SPEAKER_07]: If I'm going to have fast food, it's all about Panda Express, and I consider Panda Express fast food.

2007
02:53:38,189 --> 02:53:43,132
[SPEAKER_10]: If I'm going to have fast food, then I'll have cooked it the night before and take it out of the refrigerator.

2008
02:53:43,372 --> 02:53:45,774
[SPEAKER_10]: Funny you said that, Rob, about Panda Express.

2009
02:53:45,834 --> 02:53:45,954
[SPEAKER_07]: Why?

2010
02:53:45,974 --> 02:53:53,659
[SPEAKER_10]: Because all of a sudden I'm thinking of that little cartoon thing they have on the World of Warcraft site that says Pandoran Express, and I'm going, no!

2011
02:53:53,679 --> 02:53:53,719
[SPEAKER_10]: No!

2012
02:53:55,160 --> 02:53:57,721
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, my brain is tainted for the evening.

2013
02:53:57,741 --> 02:53:58,222
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

2014
02:53:58,262 --> 02:54:06,646
[SPEAKER_10]: Seriously, though, if people who are going to go somewhere the next day, they know that they're going to stop to get fast food, isn't it just easier to pack a lunch?

2015
02:54:06,726 --> 02:54:08,607
[SPEAKER_10]: It's cheaper and better for you.

2016
02:54:10,428 --> 02:54:13,069
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that everybody should boycott fast food for a week.

2017
02:54:14,430 --> 02:54:14,950
[SPEAKER_17]: Good.

2018
02:54:15,050 --> 02:54:16,531
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't want to... Good.

2019
02:54:16,551 --> 02:54:18,132
[SPEAKER_17]: Get out of my drive-thru.

2020
02:54:18,972 --> 02:54:19,633
[SPEAKER_10]: No, seriously.

2021
02:54:19,733 --> 02:54:24,115
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that if everybody stopped eating fast food for the duration of one entire week...

2022
02:54:24,835 --> 02:54:29,939
[SPEAKER_10]: A regular food out of the refrigerator that you go to the grocery store and have to prepare.

2023
02:54:30,780 --> 02:54:37,725
[SPEAKER_10]: After a week, I swear, your general level of health and well-being is going to be very improved.

2024
02:54:37,825 --> 02:54:42,068
[SPEAKER_07]: I would make a substantial financial wager that I could go longer without fast food than these two.

2025
02:54:42,929 --> 02:54:43,569
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I believe it.

2026
02:54:45,351 --> 02:54:47,032
[SPEAKER_10]: They wouldn't last five seconds.

2027
02:54:47,512 --> 02:54:49,194
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, right.

2028
02:54:49,554 --> 02:54:51,776
[SPEAKER_04]: Five seconds.

2029
02:54:51,936 --> 02:54:52,837
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going outside.

2030
02:54:53,877 --> 02:54:54,478
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this a bet?

2031
02:54:56,478 --> 02:54:59,960
[SPEAKER_10]: Official Orange Sounds Radio bet.

2032
02:55:00,020 --> 02:55:02,461
[SPEAKER_08]: I am the master of my domain.

2033
02:55:02,741 --> 02:55:06,083
[SPEAKER_08]: I bet I can go six fucking months without eating fast food.

2034
02:55:06,844 --> 02:55:08,184
[SPEAKER_08]: I will put money in it.

2035
02:55:08,985 --> 02:55:12,687
[SPEAKER_08]: If you... I don't believe it.

2036
02:55:12,767 --> 02:55:16,249
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't believe that Christopher would be able to right now.

2037
02:55:17,029 --> 02:55:20,611
[SPEAKER_10]: If he breaks his fast food goal...

2038
02:55:22,196 --> 02:55:26,497
[SPEAKER_10]: Then for every month remaining on the sixth month, he has to pay $10.

2039
02:55:27,758 --> 02:55:31,018
[SPEAKER_10]: So, for example, if he makes it four months and then eats fast food, he has to pay $20.

2040
02:55:31,058 --> 02:55:32,079
[SPEAKER_10]: To what?

2041
02:55:33,019 --> 02:55:34,139
[SPEAKER_10]: To us, for the station.

2042
02:55:36,640 --> 02:55:37,760
[SPEAKER_10]: You have to pay our station bill.

2043
02:55:37,780 --> 02:55:38,280
[SPEAKER_10]: You're on.

2044
02:55:39,581 --> 02:55:40,221
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't eat fast food.

2045
02:55:40,261 --> 02:55:41,041
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not betting shit.

2046
02:55:42,182 --> 02:55:43,062
[SPEAKER_17]: Wait a minute, wait a minute.

2047
02:55:44,862 --> 02:55:48,723
[SPEAKER_07]: Christopher just agreed to something that Loki and I didn't even say we'd participate in.

2048
02:55:48,763 --> 02:55:50,904
[SPEAKER_07]: So now it's all Christopher and how long he can go without fast food.

2049
02:55:51,926 --> 02:55:52,887
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki agrees too.

2050
02:55:54,349 --> 02:55:55,350
[SPEAKER_19]: I didn't agree to shit.

2051
02:55:56,752 --> 02:55:59,836
[SPEAKER_04]: If I don't go and eat fast food, where am I going to get my Best Buy bucks?

2052
02:56:00,296 --> 02:56:00,537
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

2053
02:56:01,798 --> 02:56:02,299
[SPEAKER_04]: Steal them?

2054
02:56:04,782 --> 02:56:10,409
[SPEAKER_10]: See, that's the same type of consumerism crap that's got this country buried, I swear.

2055
02:56:13,775 --> 02:56:17,858
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki just took out like $20 in Best Buy bucks.

2056
02:56:17,878 --> 02:56:18,358
[SPEAKER_07]: $22, actually.

2057
02:56:18,378 --> 02:56:18,738
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

2058
02:56:18,778 --> 02:56:20,939
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you know when the last time I ate fast food was?

2059
02:56:21,140 --> 02:56:21,360
[SPEAKER_07]: When?

2060
02:56:22,060 --> 02:56:24,361
[SPEAKER_10]: Two weeks ago, when I brought a salad.

2061
02:56:25,882 --> 02:56:27,704
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, now what is considered fast food?

2062
02:56:27,724 --> 02:56:30,605
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I don't want extrovert to get off on a technicality.

2063
02:56:30,685 --> 02:56:33,547
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't really consider McDonald's food.

2064
02:56:33,767 --> 02:56:35,388
[SPEAKER_10]: Stepping into a McDonald's?

2065
02:56:35,788 --> 02:56:39,251
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, the only thing that you would ever be allowed to buy from a McDonald's would be a salad.

2066
02:56:39,271 --> 02:56:41,432
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

2067
02:56:41,452 --> 02:56:42,492
[SPEAKER_10]: Because their salads are really good.

2068
02:56:42,553 --> 02:56:42,973
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, then...

2069
02:56:45,487 --> 02:56:48,795
[SPEAKER_08]: So is it any place to buy a salad or is it just McDonald's I can buy a salad?

2070
02:56:49,035 --> 02:56:49,617
[SPEAKER_10]: Any place.

2071
02:56:49,697 --> 02:56:53,385
[SPEAKER_10]: If they've got like salads, good healthy salads, then that's fine.

2072
02:56:53,882 --> 02:56:54,262
[SPEAKER_07]: How about this?

2073
02:56:54,562 --> 02:56:59,063
[SPEAKER_07]: If you go to a place with a drive-thru, you can't get anything with meat.

2074
02:56:59,743 --> 02:57:01,604
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait, no, because that won't work because it's a chicken salad.

2075
02:57:02,384 --> 02:57:03,304
[SPEAKER_10]: And the apple pie.

2076
02:57:03,824 --> 02:57:05,325
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, then you can't get anything but a salad.

2077
02:57:05,365 --> 02:57:07,885
[SPEAKER_10]: The only thing you could get there would be a salad and a drink to go with it.

2078
02:57:08,305 --> 02:57:09,566
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

2079
02:57:09,626 --> 02:57:12,506
[SPEAKER_08]: As long as it's not sugary.

2080
02:57:12,566 --> 02:57:15,887
[SPEAKER_10]: You have to live by my rules of fast food, which is salad.

2081
02:57:16,187 --> 02:57:19,268
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, is Subway and Quiznos considered fast food?

2082
02:57:20,376 --> 02:57:22,261
[SPEAKER_08]: Hell no, it takes 10 minutes to get fucking sandwiches.

2083
02:57:22,301 --> 02:57:23,825
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I don't consider those to be fast food.

2084
02:57:24,026 --> 02:57:29,019
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, but to raise it up a notch, I won't even eat those sandwiches.

2085
02:57:30,038 --> 02:57:30,859
[SPEAKER_10]: You can have salads.

2086
02:57:33,660 --> 02:57:36,802
[SPEAKER_07]: I do not believe you can go six months without Christmas.

2087
02:57:36,942 --> 02:57:37,902
[SPEAKER_07]: I do not believe it.

2088
02:57:37,942 --> 02:57:39,163
[SPEAKER_07]: What the fuck are you going to eat?

2089
02:57:39,423 --> 02:57:41,944
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to eat Nippon every night is what you're going to eat.

2090
02:57:42,184 --> 02:57:43,505
[SPEAKER_08]: Isn't Nippon fast food?

2091
02:57:43,565 --> 02:57:46,447
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Japanese fast food, so I can't even eat that.

2092
02:57:46,467 --> 02:57:47,307
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not fast food.

2093
02:57:47,347 --> 02:57:49,328
[SPEAKER_08]: It takes like five minutes to prepare.

2094
02:57:49,468 --> 02:57:52,170
[SPEAKER_10]: You can eat at a regular restaurant, like Applebee's or Chili's.

2095
02:57:52,230 --> 02:57:52,810
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, that's fine.

2096
02:57:53,516 --> 02:57:58,142
[SPEAKER_10]: You can get salads from these places because salads are good healthy food.

2097
02:57:58,782 --> 02:58:03,368
[SPEAKER_10]: But other than that, anything that you eat that you take to work, you have to take your lunch to work.

2098
02:58:04,895 --> 02:58:09,996
[SPEAKER_10]: You cannot eat burgers or anything unless you go buy meat and grill yourself a burger.

2099
02:58:10,516 --> 02:58:10,756
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

2100
02:58:10,816 --> 02:58:12,217
[SPEAKER_10]: Or go to Outback because they have really good burgers.

2101
02:58:12,277 --> 02:58:13,417
[SPEAKER_08]: I will seriously do this.

2102
02:58:13,537 --> 02:58:14,537
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys are totally on.

2103
02:58:15,017 --> 02:58:18,058
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys are totally, you guys are going to be eating my ass.

2104
02:58:18,078 --> 02:58:19,358
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, well, I'll tell you what, I'll tell you what.

2105
02:58:19,738 --> 02:58:20,818
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll give you some leeway.

2106
02:58:20,858 --> 02:58:21,939
[SPEAKER_10]: Tomorrow is Halloween.

2107
02:58:22,039 --> 02:58:23,099
[SPEAKER_10]: You can eat your candy corn.

2108
02:58:23,299 --> 02:58:24,259
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm starting it tonight.

2109
02:58:24,279 --> 02:58:26,099
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no, because I'm starting my diet on the 1st.

2110
02:58:26,380 --> 02:58:26,720
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, okay.

2111
02:58:27,020 --> 02:58:28,980
[SPEAKER_10]: So that way I can monitor.

2112
02:58:29,660 --> 02:58:29,920
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

2113
02:58:30,340 --> 02:58:31,100
[SPEAKER_10]: I feel so cool.

2114
02:58:31,140 --> 02:58:31,741
[SPEAKER_10]: This is going to be neat.

2115
02:58:32,041 --> 02:58:32,861
[SPEAKER_10]: So starting on the 1st.

2116
02:58:34,326 --> 02:58:35,547
[SPEAKER_10]: What's halfway through?

2117
02:58:35,607 --> 02:58:36,967
[SPEAKER_10]: That's going to be April?

2118
02:58:38,188 --> 02:58:43,610
[SPEAKER_08]: We should have like a biggest loser competition where every Orange Lounge radio show we have to all stand on a weight scale.

2119
02:58:43,630 --> 02:58:44,611
[SPEAKER_10]: No, because I'm at a freaking plateau.

2120
02:58:44,631 --> 02:58:45,251
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, how about this?

2121
02:58:45,351 --> 02:58:45,831
[SPEAKER_04]: How about this?

2122
02:58:46,371 --> 02:58:53,635
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll go, since we're starting here, the six-month mark will actually be my wedding day, so... You know what?

2123
02:58:54,978 --> 02:58:55,558
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm up for this.

2124
02:58:55,679 --> 02:58:57,219
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm up for a Biggest Loser competition.

2125
02:58:57,500 --> 02:58:59,101
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, good.

2126
02:58:59,261 --> 02:59:01,262
[SPEAKER_07]: We can do it without giving out our weights on the air.

2127
02:59:01,302 --> 02:59:01,722
[SPEAKER_10]: Crap.

2128
02:59:01,742 --> 02:59:03,183
[SPEAKER_10]: Does that mean Angel's going to do it too?

2129
02:59:03,203 --> 02:59:04,584
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you going to participate in this too?

2130
02:59:04,764 --> 02:59:04,904
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, shit.

2131
02:59:05,464 --> 02:59:06,205
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

2132
02:59:06,285 --> 02:59:09,627
[SPEAKER_10]: Except it's not really fair to me since I've dropped 60 pounds since 2003.

2133
02:59:10,127 --> 02:59:11,988
[SPEAKER_07]: Then you're the host.

2134
02:59:12,008 --> 02:59:12,609
[SPEAKER_07]: You're the moderator.

2135
02:59:13,633 --> 02:59:16,434
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm the mediator, but I'm participating too, but I'm mediating.

2136
02:59:16,554 --> 02:59:21,297
[SPEAKER_07]: I like this, forget all this other fast food stuff, it's just going to be strictly the biggest loser.

2137
02:59:21,357 --> 02:59:26,819
[SPEAKER_07]: Whoever loses the most weight in, let's make it less than six months, because our listeners don't want to wait that long.

2138
02:59:26,839 --> 02:59:28,300
[SPEAKER_07]: It has to be fast food, it has to be something like that.

2139
02:59:28,480 --> 02:59:36,523
[SPEAKER_10]: I also though, I also though, I can't rely on weight, being myself, seeing as how, okay, I will go ahead and say it on the air, I'm a size 12 right now.

2140
02:59:36,984 --> 02:59:39,785
[SPEAKER_10]: The last time I was a size 12, I was 30 pounds lighter.

2141
02:59:40,936 --> 02:59:43,898
[SPEAKER_10]: So how about whoever loses the most inches off their waist?

2142
02:59:47,080 --> 02:59:49,761
[SPEAKER_10]: Whoever loses the most clothing sizes.

2143
02:59:50,462 --> 02:59:50,762
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

2144
02:59:50,802 --> 02:59:52,703
[SPEAKER_07]: See, now we're getting too complicated and we're running out of show.

2145
02:59:53,363 --> 02:59:53,824
[SPEAKER_10]: That's easy.

2146
02:59:53,904 --> 02:59:55,244
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not dependent on weight.

2147
02:59:55,304 --> 02:59:58,526
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not dependent on really your metabolism.

2148
02:59:58,586 --> 03:00:01,328
[SPEAKER_10]: Whoever loses the most clothing sizes.

2149
03:00:02,669 --> 03:00:03,989
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm still on the fast food thing.

2150
03:00:04,109 --> 03:00:04,750
[SPEAKER_08]: I swear, though.

2151
03:00:04,910 --> 03:00:05,870
[SPEAKER_08]: Fast food for me.

2152
03:00:05,991 --> 03:00:06,351
[SPEAKER_07]: Here it is.

2153
03:00:06,611 --> 03:00:10,113
[SPEAKER_07]: If Christopher can actually go six months with no fast food...

2154
03:00:13,345 --> 03:00:20,030
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm trying to think of something I'll do.

2155
03:00:20,050 --> 03:00:20,090
[SPEAKER_08]: Ew.

2156
03:00:20,450 --> 03:00:20,851
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

2157
03:00:20,871 --> 03:00:20,911
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

2158
03:00:20,931 --> 03:00:21,651
[SPEAKER_17]: No.

2159
03:00:21,711 --> 03:00:22,292
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

2160
03:00:22,512 --> 03:00:23,633
[SPEAKER_08]: All sorts of no.

2161
03:00:23,653 --> 03:00:23,753
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki!

2162
03:00:24,914 --> 03:00:26,155
[SPEAKER_08]: Whose mind is in the gutter?

2163
03:00:28,637 --> 03:00:28,937
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

2164
03:00:29,918 --> 03:00:31,379
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll go ahead and do Biggest Loser.

2165
03:00:32,279 --> 03:00:33,220
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay?

2166
03:00:33,280 --> 03:00:34,761
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a good motivator for everybody.

2167
03:00:35,722 --> 03:00:38,224
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just, we are also, though, going to test BMI.

2168
03:00:41,567 --> 03:00:42,808
[SPEAKER_10]: Bite me, I hate BMI.

2169
03:00:43,288 --> 03:00:46,371
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but BMI is the most accurate way to test fat loss.

2170
03:00:47,872 --> 03:00:49,613
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to go buy a BMI counter.

2171
03:00:50,153 --> 03:00:50,334
[SPEAKER_10]: Ugh.

2172
03:00:51,314 --> 03:00:52,135
[SPEAKER_10]: Hide me.

2173
03:00:52,195 --> 03:00:53,076
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll do it by BMI.

2174
03:00:54,176 --> 03:00:54,797
[SPEAKER_08]: Sounds good to me.

2175
03:00:58,670 --> 03:01:02,471
[SPEAKER_07]: 6 months though is an awfully long time for this to finish, to play out.

2176
03:01:02,551 --> 03:01:03,892
[SPEAKER_08]: It's April, right?

2177
03:01:04,052 --> 03:01:06,132
[SPEAKER_08]: Isn't it 6 months April?

2178
03:01:06,212 --> 03:01:07,373
[SPEAKER_08]: We can go, we can make it.

2179
03:01:08,073 --> 03:01:11,134
[SPEAKER_08]: You remember how we were saying our lease was 6 months ago?

2180
03:01:11,154 --> 03:01:13,855
[SPEAKER_07]: I am not committing to the fast food thing because of my lifestyle.

2181
03:01:13,955 --> 03:01:15,535
[SPEAKER_07]: I just know I won't be able to do it.

2182
03:01:15,635 --> 03:01:17,356
[SPEAKER_07]: I am freely admitting, but I will cut back.

2183
03:01:17,456 --> 03:01:18,036
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll cut back.

2184
03:01:18,416 --> 03:01:18,716
[SPEAKER_07]: I will.

2185
03:01:18,976 --> 03:01:21,017
[SPEAKER_07]: If we're doing like a basic loser, I will participate.

2186
03:01:22,356 --> 03:01:37,678
[SPEAKER_10]: and I'll tell you what, I will make a private live journal community for us but we are going to post running things on the site without giving any specifics out and then we'll be able to let our listeners and if our listeners want to participate in this

2187
03:01:38,439 --> 03:01:39,560
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, we'll think of something.

2188
03:01:40,560 --> 03:01:44,203
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think, you know, because we'd have to have some way to track that.

2189
03:01:44,223 --> 03:01:45,743
[SPEAKER_10]: But you guys, I'll see you in person.

2190
03:01:46,684 --> 03:01:49,526
[SPEAKER_10]: But, you know, I encourage our listeners to participate with us on their own.

2191
03:01:50,386 --> 03:01:52,127
[SPEAKER_10]: If you don't let me have diet soda, I'm going to cry.

2192
03:01:53,228 --> 03:01:53,868
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay!

2193
03:01:54,028 --> 03:01:56,030
[SPEAKER_07]: So Angel's going to participate.

2194
03:01:56,090 --> 03:01:56,630
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to do it.

2195
03:01:57,310 --> 03:01:57,851
[SPEAKER_07]: Extra's going to do it.

2196
03:01:57,871 --> 03:01:58,671
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you doing it too, Loki?

2197
03:01:59,172 --> 03:02:01,253
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to eat all fast food.

2198
03:02:01,553 --> 03:02:02,113
[SPEAKER_07]: No, you're not.

2199
03:02:02,433 --> 03:02:03,314
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I am.

2200
03:02:03,354 --> 03:02:04,675
[SPEAKER_07]: You're going to be the biggest gainer.

2201
03:02:09,810 --> 03:02:13,812
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll have to go double your touch measurement.

2202
03:02:13,832 --> 03:02:14,693
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, no!

2203
03:02:14,713 --> 03:02:17,875
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so Angel, myself, and XRO will be the biggest loser.

2204
03:02:17,895 --> 03:02:19,836
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki will be the biggest loser.

2205
03:02:19,856 --> 03:02:23,799
[SPEAKER_10]: Which means I have to tell the entire house when I get back, no fashion wear six months!

2206
03:02:23,959 --> 03:02:26,841
[SPEAKER_10]: And they're going to give me like, huh?

2207
03:02:26,961 --> 03:02:31,464
[SPEAKER_10]: And to encourage everybody, if anyone wants to go work out, if I'm free, I'll work out with you.

2208
03:02:32,405 --> 03:02:34,146
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm doing it on my own, too.

2209
03:02:35,461 --> 03:02:36,102
[SPEAKER_10]: We're getting the middle.

2210
03:02:37,384 --> 03:02:38,745
[SPEAKER_10]: We're getting the middle, Pat, so I'll be fine.

2211
03:02:38,805 --> 03:02:40,768
[SPEAKER_07]: Six months is too damn long.

2212
03:02:41,589 --> 03:02:42,831
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what, though?

2213
03:02:43,852 --> 03:02:51,702
[SPEAKER_08]: One of the reasons why I'm doing it is because I want to see what kind of benefits this will give me in terms of financial...

2214
03:02:52,523 --> 03:02:53,103
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't have vodka?

2215
03:03:15,851 --> 03:03:16,151
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello.

2216
03:03:16,951 --> 03:03:17,211
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

2217
03:03:17,371 --> 03:03:18,332
[SPEAKER_10]: My microphone works.

2218
03:03:19,152 --> 03:03:20,913
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, we're going way too far.

2219
03:03:20,973 --> 03:03:26,174
[SPEAKER_10]: I do not think this is six months, because if you do it for six months, you're eventually going to get yourself into some healthier habits anyway.

2220
03:03:27,354 --> 03:03:29,375
[SPEAKER_10]: How the hell did we get into this topic anyway?

2221
03:03:29,555 --> 03:03:30,275
[SPEAKER_10]: It just kind of happened.

2222
03:03:30,375 --> 03:03:31,176
[SPEAKER_10]: It was his fault.

2223
03:03:31,856 --> 03:03:33,436
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it's his fault.

2224
03:03:33,636 --> 03:03:36,177
[SPEAKER_10]: Christopher Fryer.

2225
03:03:36,237 --> 03:03:36,637
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm kidding.

2226
03:03:36,657 --> 03:03:40,679
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk about food banks who want some supersized fries.

2227
03:03:41,479 --> 03:03:42,839
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds good right now.

2228
03:03:42,859 --> 03:03:44,760
[SPEAKER_10]: That sounds fucking disgusting.

2229
03:03:44,820 --> 03:03:45,120
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

2230
03:03:45,680 --> 03:03:51,223
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, I was like, shit, I was planning on getting Pizza Hut after the show tonight.

2231
03:03:51,283 --> 03:03:56,565
[SPEAKER_07]: Now I have to set a fucking example for my roommate who just made a fucking stupid bet on his show.

2232
03:03:58,146 --> 03:04:01,167
[SPEAKER_10]: For every month that you have failed, it's $10 you pay for the show.

2233
03:04:01,347 --> 03:04:04,769
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to think of a prize that you get if you win.

2234
03:04:05,169 --> 03:04:07,650
[SPEAKER_10]: If you make it, I will take you out to dinner.

2235
03:04:08,110 --> 03:04:08,370
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

2236
03:04:09,050 --> 03:04:10,271
[SPEAKER_10]: Wherever you want, whenever you want.

2237
03:04:10,971 --> 03:04:14,691
[SPEAKER_08]: You're not, you're gonna change your lifestyle for six months for a fucking free dinner?

2238
03:04:15,232 --> 03:04:16,492
[SPEAKER_08]: That, it sounds good to me.

2239
03:04:17,612 --> 03:04:23,633
[SPEAKER_08]: I, I, you know what, you, you, free dinner's pretty good when you're living on your own, you know what, you know what I mean.

2240
03:04:24,454 --> 03:04:25,234
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, alright.

2241
03:04:25,354 --> 03:04:30,315
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yeah, I can see Loki like every week coming in with a big old burger in front of us.

2242
03:04:30,395 --> 03:04:32,555
[SPEAKER_08]: I will think of a prize as well to sweeten up the pot.

2243
03:04:33,015 --> 03:04:33,255
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

2244
03:04:35,016 --> 03:04:35,816
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm thinking Red Lobster.

2245
03:04:37,679 --> 03:04:41,041
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to switch from single quarter pounders to double quarter pounders.

2246
03:04:41,261 --> 03:04:44,604
[SPEAKER_10]: I was going to say something, but I'm disgusted and I threw that out there.

2247
03:04:47,025 --> 03:04:47,766
[SPEAKER_07]: End of show.

2248
03:04:48,006 --> 03:04:48,787
[SPEAKER_07]: Final thoughts.

2249
03:04:49,407 --> 03:04:50,348
[SPEAKER_07]: Angel, your final thought.

2250
03:04:52,029 --> 03:04:53,029
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I can do this.

2251
03:04:53,170 --> 03:04:57,432
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll have to go yell at the roomies at home and tell them no fast food.

2252
03:04:57,873 --> 03:04:58,053
[SPEAKER_10]: Ever.

2253
03:05:00,034 --> 03:05:00,975
[SPEAKER_07]: Extifer, final thought.

2254
03:05:04,421 --> 03:05:07,422
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, somebody in chat wanted to hear the drumroll one more time.

2255
03:05:10,383 --> 03:05:10,723
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

2256
03:05:10,743 --> 03:05:13,603
[SPEAKER_10]: That sounds like a really messed up, I mean, Murloc.

2257
03:05:14,664 --> 03:05:15,464
[SPEAKER_04]: Addict.

2258
03:05:15,544 --> 03:05:17,504
[SPEAKER_04]: I am Sam drumroll or something.

2259
03:05:17,804 --> 03:05:19,304
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, your final thought.

2260
03:05:19,805 --> 03:05:29,447
[SPEAKER_04]: My final thought is this is the perfect week for me to actually roll out my hybrid beef slash sausage hamburger with double bacon, double cheese.

2261
03:05:31,127 --> 03:05:31,407
[SPEAKER_07]: Yummy.

2262
03:05:33,574 --> 03:05:33,974
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

2263
03:05:34,655 --> 03:05:34,995
[SPEAKER_07]: Here it is.

2264
03:05:35,235 --> 03:05:35,756
[SPEAKER_07]: Six months.

2265
03:05:36,576 --> 03:05:38,598
[SPEAKER_07]: If you can go six months, I'll buy you a fucking DS.

2266
03:05:42,060 --> 03:05:43,421
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

2267
03:05:43,701 --> 03:05:46,043
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll give you a fucking DS if you can go six months.

2268
03:05:46,483 --> 03:05:46,723
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

2269
03:05:48,304 --> 03:05:48,785
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, cool.

2270
03:05:49,545 --> 03:05:49,765
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

2271
03:05:51,407 --> 03:05:56,669
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, my final thought would be, um, X-Verse Crazy.

2272
03:05:58,429 --> 03:05:59,470
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, your final thought.

2273
03:05:59,910 --> 03:06:03,411
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, reject false icons, and even better, reject fast food.

2274
03:06:04,311 --> 03:06:07,132
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, fucking chatroom, fucking chatroom.

2275
03:06:08,313 --> 03:06:12,314
[SPEAKER_07]: There's gonna be a betting pool for the fucking biggest loser contest we're having.

2276
03:06:12,374 --> 03:06:13,875
[SPEAKER_07]: You fucking bet on me.

2277
03:06:14,335 --> 03:06:14,675
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

2278
03:06:15,215 --> 03:06:17,476
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I already won since I did drop 60 pounds.

2279
03:06:18,249 --> 03:06:19,930
[SPEAKER_07]: But you're not participating in this competition.

2280
03:06:20,030 --> 03:06:22,491
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm monitoring because I'm the help guru.

2281
03:06:22,511 --> 03:06:23,552
[SPEAKER_07]: You're setting an example.

2282
03:06:23,892 --> 03:06:24,692
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm the example.

2283
03:06:24,712 --> 03:06:25,393
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm so cool.

2284
03:06:25,833 --> 03:06:26,433
[SPEAKER_07]: Odds are in.

2285
03:06:26,754 --> 03:06:27,534
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki is 99 to 1 odds.

2286
03:06:32,281 --> 03:06:33,242
[SPEAKER_07]: God, I love you guys.

2287
03:06:33,302 --> 03:06:34,483
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to get in on that action.

2288
03:06:34,643 --> 03:06:35,683
[SPEAKER_07]: I fucking love you guys.

2289
03:06:35,823 --> 03:06:36,184
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2290
03:06:36,644 --> 03:06:39,846
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously, chat room, you people make this show, and everybody that listens.

2291
03:06:39,986 --> 03:06:41,647
[SPEAKER_10]: We love you, chat room.

2292
03:06:41,928 --> 03:06:42,288
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2293
03:06:42,808 --> 03:06:44,409
[SPEAKER_07]: You motivate us to be thin.

2294
03:06:44,429 --> 03:06:46,231
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, I have one other thing.

2295
03:06:46,711 --> 03:06:46,931
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

2296
03:06:47,091 --> 03:06:53,355
[SPEAKER_10]: For all of my fellow Gorillaz fans, they're broadcasting the Manchester show on BBC One, streaming.

2297
03:06:53,816 --> 03:06:55,777
[SPEAKER_10]: BBC One, BBC Two.

2298
03:06:56,017 --> 03:06:56,538
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, anyway.

2299
03:06:58,259 --> 03:06:59,420
[SPEAKER_07]: Fucking, we've got to end the show already.

2300
03:06:59,480 --> 03:07:00,080
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, bye.

2301
03:07:00,120 --> 03:07:01,161
[SPEAKER_07]: Last word, Loki.

2302
03:07:02,654 --> 03:07:03,594
[SPEAKER_21]: Surprise!

2303
03:07:04,795 --> 03:07:09,658
[SPEAKER_21]: That does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live.

2304
03:07:10,498 --> 03:07:14,700

[SPEAKER_09]: This is your old pal, Stinky Wizzleteeth.

2308
03:07:38,834 --> 03:07:40,635
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a song about a whale.

2309
03:07:41,055 --> 03:07:41,335
[SPEAKER_09]: No!

2310
03:07:43,236 --> 03:07:45,098
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a song about being happy.

2311
03:07:45,558 --> 03:07:46,078
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right.

2312
03:07:47,619 --> 03:07:50,201
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the happy, happy, joy, joy song.

2313

[SPEAKER_09]: I'll teach you to be happy.

2316
03:08:13,095 --> 03:08:14,916
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll teach your grandmother to suck eggs.

2317
03:08:15,876 --> 03:08:18,557
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, boys and girls, let's try it again.

[SPEAKER_17]: Happy, happy, joy, joy.

2319
03:08:22,006 --> 03:08:23,426
[SPEAKER_18]: Happy, happy, joy, joy.

2320
03:08:23,667 --> 03:08:25,327
[SPEAKER_18]: Happy, happy, joy, joy.

2321

[SPEAKER_09]: Happy, happy, joy, joy.

2326
03:08:33,771 --> 03:08:35,832
[SPEAKER_09]: If and you ain't the granddaddy of all liars.

2327
03:08:37,593 --> 03:08:38,994
[SPEAKER_09]: The little critters of nature.

2328
03:08:39,794 --> 03:08:40,875
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't know that they're ugly.

2329
03:08:41,955 --> 03:08:42,796
[SPEAKER_09]: That's very funny.

2330
03:08:43,556 --> 03:08:45,337
[SPEAKER_09]: A fly marrying a bumblebee.

2331
03:08:46,577 --> 03:08:47,658
[SPEAKER_09]: I told you I'd shoot.

2332
03:08:48,365 --> 03:08:49,306
[SPEAKER_09]: But you didn't believe me.

2333
03:08:50,046 --> 03:08:51,307
[SPEAKER_09]: Why didn't you believe me?

2334
03:08:51,948 --> 03:08:53,349
Happy, happy, joy, joy

2335
03:09:19,122 --> 03:09:22,613
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.

2336
03:09:56,815 --> 03:10:05,858
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, the guys just did their weigh-ins for the, uh, and we're not going to say our weight because the whole idea is that we don't have to say our weight, but, oh my god, I was surprised.

2337
03:10:06,599 --> 03:10:09,960
[SPEAKER_07]: I hit a certain landmark that I didn't think I was over yet, and I'm like, oh, fuck.

2338
03:10:09,980 --> 03:10:11,861
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, so we'll see what happens.

2339
03:10:14,606 --> 03:10:16,267
[SPEAKER_07]: Did I really tell Extra Fried to buy him a DS?

2340
03:10:16,787 --> 03:10:17,387
[SPEAKER_07]: God, I'm poor.

2341
03:10:17,547 --> 03:10:18,087
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, you did.

2342
03:10:18,127 --> 03:10:19,948
[SPEAKER_07]: We have proof of that.

2343
03:10:19,988 --> 03:10:20,328
[SPEAKER_07]: That's fine.

2344
03:10:20,348 --> 03:10:21,969
[SPEAKER_07]: If he can go six months without fast food, he earned it.

2345
03:10:21,989 --> 03:10:24,710
[SPEAKER_07]: And I bet you anything Jay will get in on that, too.

2346
03:10:25,310 --> 03:10:25,890
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll bet you anything.

2347
03:10:26,170 --> 03:10:30,972
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm telling you right now, I'm at a plateau right now where I can eat as much fast food as I want, and I stay the same weight, so you know what?

2348
03:10:30,992 --> 03:10:33,893
[SPEAKER_07]: To be fair, you won a mat.

2349
03:10:33,913 --> 03:10:34,433
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, okay.

2350
03:10:34,453 --> 03:10:36,614
[SPEAKER_07]: You won a mat.

2351
03:10:36,654 --> 03:10:36,874
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

2352
03:10:36,914 --> 03:10:38,655
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you are going to participate, too, then, Miss Jay?

2353
03:10:40,196 --> 03:10:41,256
[SPEAKER_10]: As a motivator for everybody.

2354
03:10:42,242 --> 03:10:42,742
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't believe it.

2355
03:10:42,762 --> 03:10:46,665
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're going to track this on the website, like how much weight we all... I'm not eligible for any prizes.

2356
03:10:47,405 --> 03:10:50,987
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm still moderating it, so I'm not eligible for any prizes, but I'm doing it for motivation purposes.

2357
03:10:51,848 --> 03:10:53,449
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be a crazy six months, gang.

2358
03:10:54,622 --> 03:10:57,663
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but I've needed to do it since I met you guys, so you know what?

2359
03:10:57,963 --> 03:10:58,603
[SPEAKER_10]: It's time to go.

2360
03:10:59,043 --> 03:11:00,183
[SPEAKER_10]: One thing, though, that, you know...

2361
03:11:22,853 --> 03:11:25,035
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, all I want, if I win, I want sex.

2362
03:11:25,315 --> 03:11:27,557
[SPEAKER_07]: Not with any of you, I just want sex in general.

2363
03:11:28,157 --> 03:11:28,898
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll hire somebody.

2364
03:11:28,978 --> 03:11:29,898
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, sounds awesome.

2365
03:11:30,299 --> 03:11:33,481
[SPEAKER_07]: On this note, we really got to pull the plug, guys, so we can get to our podcast.

2366
03:11:33,501 --> 03:11:34,842
[SPEAKER_10]: If I win, I want fries.

2367
03:11:34,982 --> 03:11:37,164
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, good night, thank you.

2368
03:11:37,184 --> 03:11:39,465
[SPEAKER_10]: If you win, I'm buying you five pounds of fries.

2369
03:11:39,626 --> 03:11:40,206
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, hell yeah.

2370
03:11:41,947 --> 03:11:42,768
[SPEAKER_13]: Let it be noted.

2371
03:11:43,969 --> 03:11:45,530
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, we're done, we're done.

2372
03:11:46,210 --> 03:11:49,633
[SPEAKER_07]: Tune back in, 15 seconds, Orange Lodge Radio, video game music.
