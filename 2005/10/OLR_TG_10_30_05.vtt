00:53.860 --> 00:56.900
minute thing she had to go take care of so unfortunately she wasn't able to be here for

00:56.900 --> 00:57.900
the recording.

00:57.900 --> 00:59.900
That's two weeks in a row now though, we're counting.

00:59.900 --> 01:00.900
Shame shame.

01:00.900 --> 01:01.900
Shame shame.

01:01.900 --> 01:05.540
No, she says hi and she'll be back next week I'm sure.

01:05.540 --> 01:08.580
However, we do have as always the one and only Tech Masoloki.

01:08.580 --> 01:09.580
Yep.

01:09.580 --> 01:10.580
I'm here.

01:10.580 --> 01:11.580
How you doing?

01:11.580 --> 01:12.580
Good.

01:12.580 --> 01:13.580
Good.

01:13.580 --> 01:14.580
Good to hear.

01:14.580 --> 01:15.580
All right.

01:15.580 --> 01:16.580
Well, let's just get into it.

01:16.580 --> 01:17.580
Let's talk about the games we've been playing this week.

01:17.580 --> 01:19.480
That's usually how we like to start off the show by letting you guys know what's going

01:19.480 --> 01:21.120
on in our gaming world.

01:21.120 --> 01:25.760
And I noticed some of the posts on the forums say, damn, you guys like to play a lot of

01:25.760 --> 01:28.560
games or you guys really seem to play a lot of games.

01:28.560 --> 01:30.760
How is it that we're able to play so many games, Logie?

01:30.760 --> 01:31.760
What do you think?

01:31.760 --> 01:33.840
I don't think I play that many games, honestly, but...

01:33.840 --> 01:34.840
I don't.

01:34.840 --> 01:39.840
I mean, I play like one game a week usually, and usually you'll notice, like for example,

01:39.840 --> 01:40.840
burnout.

01:40.840 --> 01:44.120
I'll play it in a month at a time and then I'll get snippets of games I'll play for like

01:44.120 --> 01:48.040
an hour or something just to try them out, that type of thing.

01:48.040 --> 01:50.960
And of course, you know, things are kind of going the same pattern now.

01:50.960 --> 01:54.000
It's going to get a little crazy in a couple weeks when the 360 comes out because I've

01:54.000 --> 01:58.420
got four games on order, so that'll be a little interesting.

01:58.420 --> 02:01.520
I don't know how I do, I just, there's so much coming out right now that there's just,

02:01.520 --> 02:05.320
I seem to be buying at least one new game a week, and that's buying, kids, I don't get

02:05.320 --> 02:06.320
a lot of this stuff for free.

02:06.320 --> 02:10.040
I did get one free game thanks to Loki this week, but we don't really get the hookup or

02:10.040 --> 02:12.440
anything, so we actually buy these games, so.

02:12.440 --> 02:15.480
I do a lot of games for free, but I don't play them, to be honest.

02:15.480 --> 02:20.680
Well, I just got Castlevania DS. I want to play that because that looks good. And I got

02:20.680 --> 02:25.440
some more Dance Dance Revolution Xtreme 2. But they had Wallace and Gromit, Curse of

02:25.440 --> 02:28.960
the Were-Rabbit, and I was like, eh, no. I'm not going to play that game.

02:28.960 --> 02:31.800
Usually games based on movies aren't all that great, although there's some good ones.

02:31.800 --> 02:35.120
I don't know. I can bring one in and give it away or something, I don't know.

02:35.120 --> 02:36.960
Yeah, listeners will like that.

02:36.960 --> 02:42.120
So I don't get a chance to... I picked up a couple games. I picked up Grand Theft Auto

02:42.120 --> 02:47.040
Liberty City Stories, and I played it for like five minutes, and usually Grand Theft

02:47.040 --> 02:50.800
Auto I'm just like getting right into it, and it's like, oh man, you know, I have to

02:50.800 --> 02:55.920
play this game, but it seems like I've, this game feels like I've played it before, it

02:55.920 --> 02:59.760
just seems like Grand Theft Auto 3 all over again, there's nothing really pulling me in

02:59.760 --> 03:03.300
other than, ooh I want to try out the multiplayer, but that's it, I think I'm going to put this

03:03.300 --> 03:07.600
game down in about like a day, and, well I was just about to ask you how your gaming

03:07.600 --> 03:10.440
week was, but I suppose that's a big part of it there, is the Liberty City.

03:10.440 --> 03:14.840
I'm just saying, you know, I've picked up other stuff, but yeah, it's just, it's really

03:14.840 --> 03:15.960
not keeping my attention.

03:15.960 --> 03:20.480
It's a good game, I'm assuming, because once you get into the storyline, the problem comes

03:20.480 --> 03:23.400
down to, I just don't have enough time to play this stuff.

03:23.400 --> 03:28.520
I really don't, and I don't have enough time to dedicate to Grand Theft Auto Liberty City

03:28.520 --> 03:31.880
Stories because that's a game that requires a lot of time.

03:31.880 --> 03:35.920
Same with San Andreas, I didn't even finish that game, I just didn't have enough time

03:35.920 --> 03:36.920
to dedicate to it.

03:36.920 --> 03:38.320
I got bored with it after a while.

03:38.320 --> 03:43.100
in a while there's a great game though where you make time for it. Yeah, exactly. And that

03:43.100 --> 03:47.840
great game is the Warriors. I love that game. So that's what you've been playing instead.

03:47.840 --> 03:53.720
I've been playing the Warriors this week and I have to say Rockstar has really, you know,

03:53.720 --> 03:58.960
they really did a really good job translating the movie into a game and it's really surprising

03:58.960 --> 04:04.400
because I think this game itself, for people that don't know what the Warriors are, it's

04:04.400 --> 04:08.440
It's a good game, but it's also a game that will make you want to see the movie.

04:08.440 --> 04:11.440
Also if you've seen the movie, it's a game that you'll want to play.

04:11.440 --> 04:16.400
After seeing and playing this game, I'm like, damn, I've got to watch this movie.

04:16.400 --> 04:17.960
It's win-win I think.

04:17.960 --> 04:22.200
A really solid game, they've really put the polish into it like they've done with Grand

04:22.200 --> 04:26.480
Theft Auto where they have mini stuff that's in the game and just really fun stuff.

04:26.480 --> 04:31.320
One of the things I like most about it is this kind of rumble mode type thing where

04:31.320 --> 04:33.800
you go in and do quick fights.

04:33.800 --> 04:38.800
you go through the game you unlock more fights so it starts off with one on one and then

04:38.800 --> 04:44.240
War Party which is five on five and then I just unlocked one that's called Arming which

04:44.240 --> 04:50.200
is nine on nine and it keeps going on with that you unlock more arenas that you can fight

04:50.200 --> 04:55.760
in and unlock more gangs and stuff and overall the game is really fun you can pick up objects

04:55.760 --> 05:00.360
and stuff like I was mugging a guy and I threw a trash can at his head or threw a police

05:00.360 --> 05:02.840
officer through a window. I mean, it's just really fun.

05:02.840 --> 05:05.240
Alright, cool. Yeah.

05:05.240 --> 05:07.680
Fun's what it's all about. Is that it?

05:07.680 --> 05:10.920
That's all I've been playing. I still haven't gotten a chance to play Shadow of Colossus

05:10.920 --> 05:13.480
yet. It's on, like, the list.

05:13.480 --> 05:16.880
I've been dying to check out that game because our forums have been very active about this

05:16.880 --> 05:20.440
game and lit up, and I've heard a lot of great things about it, so I'm hoping that that can

05:20.440 --> 05:24.440
be on my list for next week, but we'll see. It's going to be a busy November.

05:24.440 --> 05:30.880
Well we have Battlefront 2 coming out this week, actually tomorrow, or no I should say

05:30.880 --> 05:37.400
the first, so there's a lot of stuff and that's going to be a really awesome game.

05:37.400 --> 05:40.160
My gaming week, I played a couple games this week, I actually played three games, I'm going

05:40.160 --> 05:43.280
to review two of them for you. The one I did not play so much of this week, I bought this

05:43.280 --> 05:48.800
but I haven't really sat down to any extent with this, and that's the Taito collection

05:48.800 --> 05:54.400
that's come out recently with the bubble bobble and Rainbow Islands and elevator

05:54.400 --> 06:00.080
action and Rastan and all these old kicks and all these old old games that

06:00.080 --> 06:03.500
were put out by Taito and of course Space Invaders is on there too so I'm

06:03.500 --> 06:05.820
going to review that on next week's show because I didn't get to play it enough

06:05.820 --> 06:09.760
this week because I was too busy with other games one of them being Soul

06:09.760 --> 06:15.120
Calibur 3. Soul Calibur 3 I picked up this week on a whim. Soul Calibur 3 is

06:15.120 --> 06:20.400
pretty hot I gotta say at first at first my reaction to Soul Calibur 3 was this

06:20.400 --> 06:26.640
is really more like Soul Calibur 2.5 it doesn't really feel like that radically

06:26.640 --> 06:30.160
different from Soul Calibur 2 at first glance because you really just have

06:30.160 --> 06:33.680
pretty much the same characters and different clothing I mean granted there's

06:33.680 --> 06:36.480
small changes here and there you pretty much have the same characters and

06:36.480 --> 06:40.400
different outfits and then you know the three new ones but the game does start

06:40.400 --> 06:44.640
to go really a lot deeper than that and the game has these really interesting

06:44.640 --> 06:48.960
modes in them of course you have your challenge mode I don't remember the

06:48.960 --> 06:51.800
official soul battle or something where you just you do these different types

06:51.800 --> 06:55.600
like death match or coin collecting these weird modes but I gotta say this

06:55.600 --> 07:00.160
one mode that really I thought was just so fascinating was the chronicles of the

07:00.160 --> 07:04.000
sword mode which is this mode that suddenly soul caliber turns into this

07:04.000 --> 07:07.640
tactical game where you're moving your characters around trying to capture

07:07.640 --> 07:11.640
castles and when you get into battles you can actually zoom to the battle and

07:11.640 --> 07:14.680
actually have a real Soul Calibur style match.

07:14.680 --> 07:17.720
Which I thought was a very interesting addition to the game.

07:17.720 --> 07:19.600
And you kinda consider that Soul Calibur's

07:19.600 --> 07:22.520
kinda been going outside the box for a little while now

07:22.520 --> 07:24.440
because they had that mode in Soul Calibur 2

07:24.440 --> 07:27.120
and then the conquest mode in the arcades.

07:27.120 --> 07:28.300
It was really cool.

07:29.440 --> 07:31.200
I'm trying to make it much more than just a fighting game

07:31.200 --> 07:33.120
and I think that's really great.

07:33.120 --> 07:35.400
Now if you are not a fan of fighting games,

07:35.400 --> 07:38.400
is Soul Calibur 3 gonna have anything new to win you over?

07:38.400 --> 07:39.560
Probably not.

07:39.560 --> 07:43.640
I don't think if you're a fighting games person, Soul Calibur 3 is going to have anything really

07:43.640 --> 07:44.640
for you.

07:44.640 --> 07:48.180
And I think if you're not a fan of the Soul Calibur series to begin with, 3 is not going

07:48.180 --> 07:51.100
to have anything that new that's going to bowl you over.

07:51.100 --> 07:58.420
I mean, there's some great new modes and some new things and stuff, but I just don't think

07:58.420 --> 08:02.060
if you are into fighting games you're going to find anything great here.

08:02.060 --> 08:04.980
Have you played with the create a character mode?

08:04.980 --> 08:05.980
Yes, now that was the other thing.

08:05.980 --> 08:07.900
The create a character mode is hilarious.

08:07.900 --> 08:11.060
Hilarious now basically create a character mode

08:11.060 --> 08:16.620
I think is a little you don't get to create as much as you think you basically pick from one of a few

08:16.980 --> 08:23.140
Types like you can be a ninja or an assassin or a dancer now

08:23.140 --> 08:26.980
I have a I have a create your own character dancer who uses tambourines for a weapon

08:26.980 --> 08:29.620
But see you don't really get to pick with the wet, you know

08:29.620 --> 08:32.620
You don't get to pick the type of weapon, but then you design the outfits

08:32.620 --> 08:34.420
So it's more like you're playing Barbie

08:34.420 --> 08:37.980
So caliber Barbie style where you're choosing the different outfits and the color for the outfits

08:37.980 --> 08:41.340
But you can still do an awful lot with that and it's kind of cool

08:41.340 --> 08:46.480
And it makes you know, you laugh because you know, we made this one character that doesn't wear pants, but he wears a giant pope hat

08:47.580 --> 08:52.900
Style thing and he's a ninja then it's really funny and we gave him like the old man

08:53.140 --> 09:00.380
Yes, he's a pantsless pope ninja and he's awesome. So, you know, you can have fun with it. And it's it's it's a it's a cute idea

09:00.380 --> 09:06.740
of course I miss having cool characters like link and spawn but you know that's

09:06.740 --> 09:10.240
the creative character thing more than makes up for it it's a pretty funny mode

09:10.240 --> 09:14.420
and it leaves a lot to achieve in the game because there's a lot of stuff to

09:14.420 --> 09:18.200
unlock a lot of outfits and you unlock stuff fast in this game too probably

09:18.200 --> 09:21.160
within the first 15 minutes of me playing Soulcalibur 3 I had three

09:21.160 --> 09:26.000
characters three new characters unlocked so I think it's kind of neat so I do

09:26.000 --> 09:30.260
recommend Soulcalibur 3 I think it's a very solid great game honestly if you're

09:30.260 --> 09:33.120
a fan of Soul Calibur you probably already have this game and if you don't

09:33.120 --> 09:36.860
already have it you need to go get it because if you remotely enjoyed the

09:36.860 --> 09:40.020
previous Soul Calibur games especially Soul Calibur 2 you will enjoy Soul

09:40.020 --> 09:43.360
Calibur 3. I'm just a little upset that they didn't put it in the arcades I

09:43.360 --> 09:47.580
think it would have been a great arcade game but maybe because all the new stuff

09:47.580 --> 09:50.560
is very centered around the single-player mode I think if you take

09:50.560 --> 09:54.300
just the versus mode without create a character there's really not a whole lot

09:54.300 --> 09:59.260
different from Soul Calibur 2 save three new characters and some backgrounds so I

09:59.260 --> 10:02.980
I think it is something that and now and now having played it on the console

10:02.980 --> 10:07.260
I think this is something that they really you know, there would be no point pointing it to the arcade

10:07.260 --> 10:11.620
But I don't know. I just I'm just a little disappointed to see that it didn't continue in the arcade

10:11.980 --> 10:17.260
the other game I checked out this week was midday Midway arcade treasures part 3 for the

10:17.980 --> 10:19.980
Xbox was the system I played it on

10:19.980 --> 10:30.220
um eight racing games including stun runner hydro thunder off-road uh off-road thunder that's what

10:30.220 --> 10:34.300
i'm thinking of and then like iron man's off-road but they took iron man out and now it's just some

10:34.300 --> 10:40.860
regular guy because i guess licensing ran up or whatever um the reason why i was so drawn to this

10:40.860 --> 10:45.740
game and i was so excited to play this game was for iron man off-road because i have very fond

10:45.740 --> 10:50.700
memories of dumping a shitload of quarters into a pizzeria arcade machine

10:50.700 --> 10:53.480
and just playing this game over and over again and they even have the track pack

10:53.480 --> 10:59.720
one which I think is awesome so I was I was loving it it's cool it's a retro

10:59.720 --> 11:03.340
trip I mean you kind of know how you feel about those retro collections if

11:03.340 --> 11:05.860
you kind of find them a waste of money then you're probably not going to get

11:05.860 --> 11:09.720
anything new out of this I was a little disappointed at first it's nothing but

11:09.720 --> 11:13.340
the racing games but when you consider the Midways kind of already packaged all

11:13.340 --> 11:18.020
their other stuff, and put it in Treasures 1 and 2, which were both very solid collections.

11:18.020 --> 11:23.220
This collections, you know, they made pretty good use out of what they got left.

11:23.220 --> 11:27.980
Now, I was a little disappointed though, because Hydro Thunder and Off-Road Thunder do not

11:27.980 --> 11:34.060
appear to be arcade ports, or if they are, they sure don't play like them, they feel

11:34.060 --> 11:36.980
very console-ish, I think they're ports of the console versions, I don't think they're

11:36.980 --> 11:41.500
ports of the arcade, which was a little bit disappointing, and I don't know if maybe the

11:41.500 --> 11:42.740
hardware can handle it, but...

11:42.740 --> 11:47.740
Well, it should be able to. I remember the hardware versions. I used to love Off-Road Thunder.

11:47.740 --> 11:50.740
That was my game to play at, like, Cuzar and stuff.

11:50.740 --> 11:55.740
And it looked amazing. It looked pretty good. But yeah, I can imagine.

11:55.740 --> 12:01.740
I don't think they're straight arcade ports. Or if they are, they tweaked them so they don't really feel like the arcade.

12:01.740 --> 12:08.740
So I was a little sad at that, but it's still a pretty solid buy for $20.

12:08.740 --> 12:13.140
if you like racing games you're gonna love this otherwise and it's in that

12:13.140 --> 12:17.260
same great interface that they have part two in and I think they went back and

12:17.260 --> 12:21.780
updated part one with but part two's got a great interface and three just kind of

12:21.780 --> 12:24.980
continues that if it's not broke don't fix it Xbox Live aware and all that good

12:24.980 --> 12:30.580
stuff if you're on Xbox so I I would I kind of borderline recommend it I think

12:30.580 --> 12:36.900
that treasures 2 and treasures 1 are more must-haves than treasures 3 but if

12:36.900 --> 12:42.100
If you like these old retro collections, you definitely want to pick up Treasures 3.

12:42.100 --> 12:44.260
It's a good buy for 20 bucks, you can't go wrong.

12:44.260 --> 12:47.080
So I give it kind of, if you're a retro fan, I recommend it.

12:47.080 --> 12:50.380
If you're not so much a retro fan, I can only really give it a borderline recommendation

12:50.380 --> 12:55.020
because it's just, it's a very focused genre and it kind of gets old, I think, if you're

12:55.020 --> 12:56.020
not into it.

12:56.020 --> 12:59.580
So, all right, so those are two games and then next week I'll talk about Taito.

12:59.580 --> 13:01.060
Let's get into some gaming news, shall we?

13:01.060 --> 13:02.060
Shall we?

13:02.060 --> 13:04.700
We'll talk about some news going on.

13:04.700 --> 13:08.700
Florida is going to follow the footsteps of California, supposedly, because a violent

13:08.700 --> 13:11.700
video game bill has been proposed in Florida now.

13:11.700 --> 13:15.380
However, there's a little bit of a difference there.

13:15.380 --> 13:22.740
Florida's proposal also includes violent arcade games and shop-selling arcade machines, and

13:22.740 --> 13:26.300
not just the retail over-the-counter ones, which I think is very interesting.

13:26.300 --> 13:27.820
Ehhhh, that's retarded.

13:27.820 --> 13:29.620
Well, how so?

13:29.620 --> 13:35.460
I mean, I can't sell this violent arcade game to a minor.

13:35.460 --> 13:36.460
Is that what it's gonna be?

13:36.460 --> 13:39.660
I know, I guess, but what do you do about little kids walking into an arcade?

13:39.660 --> 13:44.980
I mean, I don't think the bill is really set to cover that, but, I mean, Mortal Kombat,

13:44.980 --> 13:47.340
I saw it like, you know, 15 and it was awesome.

13:47.340 --> 13:51.740
It's not that violent, I mean, I don't know, it's...

13:51.740 --> 13:54.300
You remember the big stink they raised about Mortal Kombat though.

13:54.300 --> 13:59.460
Yeah, and I never got it then, I didn't get it now, so, I mean, it's just retarded.

13:59.460 --> 14:02.740
just thought we'd let you know it teaches people how to rip spines off of

14:02.740 --> 14:07.560
people I don't think which reminds me I have a message for Jack Thompson if he's

14:07.560 --> 14:10.820
listening which he probably is not but you know this whole debacle going around

14:10.820 --> 14:15.020
with Jack Thompson and even this week the Seattle Police basically said you

14:15.020 --> 14:19.300
know what this is more of a civil issue we're not gonna really go here which it

14:19.300 --> 14:23.500
really isn't a big surprise but I have a message for Jack Thompson I'm seriously

14:23.500 --> 14:31.060
go see Saw 2 and and focus your energies on things like that because that's

14:31.060 --> 14:36.980
that's real violent that kind of stuff video games are cartoons compared to

14:36.980 --> 14:43.180
that movie I want to see that movie I all kidding aside I mean obviously the

14:43.180 --> 14:47.460
issue is you know movies are rated R and and you you're warned about it and maybe

14:47.460 --> 14:51.660
he feels that video games aren't so well rated although I seem to recall ratings

14:51.660 --> 14:57.580
on the bottom of every video game but seriously the movies the movies can be

14:57.580 --> 15:03.580
way worse you guys that's my opinion Liberty City Stories of course look you

15:03.580 --> 15:06.440
brought that up earlier in the show and you know that the custom soundtrack

15:06.440 --> 15:10.340
option is is usually locked out like you can't really get to it in the game

15:10.340 --> 15:15.480
however Rockstar Games is now offering for download a Rockstar custom tracks

15:15.480 --> 15:20.300
program that will allow you to rip tracks off commercial music CDs and put

15:20.300 --> 15:25.300
them into your custom soundtracks for Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories.

15:25.300 --> 15:28.580
The interesting thing about this, though, is that it won't recognize stuff you bought

15:28.580 --> 15:34.060
off iTunes, which kind of sucks, and it will not rip music from CD-Rs.

15:34.060 --> 15:36.580
Yes, it will.

15:36.580 --> 15:41.500
Well, they say that you can't rip music from CD-Rs.

15:41.500 --> 15:44.800
They say that you can't, but you can.

15:44.800 --> 15:51.100
people do is they either, like for example, if you have iTunes, burn a CD and you can

15:51.100 --> 15:56.120
either do it that way and burn a CD and then rip it that way. Or if you have other tracks

15:56.120 --> 16:01.320
that won't rip for whatever reason, you use your CD burning software to create a disc

16:01.320 --> 16:05.960
image and you open that image in a program like Daemon Tools that creates a virtual CD

16:05.960 --> 16:12.120
ROM and you can do it that way. Wow. That's a long way to go about doing it. And the thing

16:12.120 --> 16:16.800
about the custom tracks though it's not like its own radio station like in the PC version

16:16.800 --> 16:22.440
or something. You actually it will play like a CD player so instead of switching stations

16:22.440 --> 16:27.680
you're switching tracks. So it's not like you know you get in a car and you can have

16:27.680 --> 16:33.240
your own custom station which kind of sucks but I don't know. Interesting. Well Blizzcon

16:33.240 --> 16:37.400
was going on this past weekend and if you went to Blizzcon I didn't because I didn't

16:37.400 --> 16:41.280
really get into the Warcraft thing until just a couple weeks ago. I'm not in the Warcraft

16:41.280 --> 16:46.600
Well, I mean, it's not that I hadn't played Diablo II and Warcraft II.

16:46.600 --> 16:48.480
I never really did get into StarCraft, though.

16:48.480 --> 16:49.480
I don't know.

16:49.480 --> 16:51.760
I somehow just completely missed the boat on that one.

16:51.760 --> 16:54.600
But as far as Warcraft II goes, I just sucked at it.

16:54.600 --> 16:56.000
I sucked at it.

16:56.000 --> 16:59.540
And Diablo, I played for a little while and then kind of gave up on.

16:59.540 --> 17:03.240
So I'm just now kind of going back to the Blizzard stuff.

17:03.240 --> 17:05.280
Of course, BlizzCon, very well attended.

17:05.280 --> 17:06.280
Lots of people there.

17:06.280 --> 17:07.960
Lots of stories from BlizzCon.

17:07.960 --> 17:14.320
And they are saying that they are going to be testing a new game, and if you use the

17:14.320 --> 17:18.720
I guess number on the back of your Blizzcon pass, you can go to a website and sign up

17:18.720 --> 17:20.160
to beta test a new game.

17:20.160 --> 17:22.760
But they won't say what the game is.

17:22.760 --> 17:26.160
Is it a new Diablo game?

17:26.160 --> 17:28.820
Is it a WoW expansion or something?

17:28.820 --> 17:34.420
Or is it possibly Starcraft Ghost, although I think that's already on its way.

17:34.420 --> 17:35.420
So I don't know.

17:35.420 --> 17:38.500
So we don't know what it's going to be.

17:38.500 --> 17:43.100
But I imagine all those Blizzard fanboys and girls will be signing up in droves.

17:43.100 --> 17:48.660
Anyway, also speaking of World of Warcraft, we definitely, definitely have to mention

17:48.660 --> 17:53.300
the Burning Crusade, the new expansion that was mentioned this week for World of Warcraft.

17:53.300 --> 17:55.600
They're going to be upping the level cap to 70.

17:55.600 --> 17:59.700
Two brand new playable races, Blood Elves on the Horde side.

17:59.700 --> 18:03.420
And although they won't say what it is on the Alliance side, we're hearing buzz that

18:03.420 --> 18:08.820
it's pandarens but take that with a grain of salt but blood elves is the

18:08.820 --> 18:14.420
for sure one some new starting zones and you can go through the dark portal which

18:14.420 --> 18:19.520
is a reference to the Warcraft 2 expansions new flying mounts you know

18:19.520 --> 18:24.580
like instead of riding a horse I guess they fly now and tons of new quests and

18:24.580 --> 18:28.820
tons of new items and jewel crafting a new profession because you're gonna have

18:28.820 --> 18:32.660
socketed items now which is kind of something borrowed from Diablo but if

18:32.660 --> 18:37.060
think about it, World of Warcraft pretty much plays like a Diablo game anyway, so that's

18:37.060 --> 18:38.740
not too big of a surprise.

18:38.740 --> 18:43.220
So I'm sure a lot of you folks that are into Warcraft are very excited about that expansion.

18:43.220 --> 18:44.560
I would be too.

18:44.560 --> 18:46.780
So I'm definitely going to pick this up.

18:46.780 --> 18:47.780
It'll be exciting.

18:47.780 --> 18:48.780
Yeah.

18:48.780 --> 18:50.780
Alright, Loki, you got something for us?

18:50.780 --> 18:51.780
Yeah.

18:51.780 --> 18:57.540
Well, first thing I'm looking at is screenshots from the Matrix Path of Neo, which is coming

18:57.540 --> 19:00.740
out in a couple weeks, and that looks damn sexy.

19:00.740 --> 19:07.840
You know, a lot of people panned the previous game, Enter the Matrix, I didn't think it

19:07.840 --> 19:08.840
was that bad.

19:08.840 --> 19:14.760
I thought it was a really neat idea, how they really made it a continuation of the movies,

19:14.760 --> 19:21.160
and even if the movies 2 and 3 sucked, it was a neat continuation idea, like it really

19:21.160 --> 19:22.920
fused the whole movies and games thing.

19:22.920 --> 19:26.440
I got to give them a lot of credit for that, and the game itself was not that bad.

19:26.440 --> 19:28.000
It wasn't bad at all.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.500
I thought it was kind of neat.

19:29.500 --> 19:32.180
It was fun, it was tough.

19:32.180 --> 19:37.140
This one looks really bad ass and the graphics really stepped it up a bit, but anyways, that's

19:37.140 --> 19:39.860
not what I had.

19:39.860 --> 19:45.180
The first thing I wanted to mention actually, there's been a whole lot of, you know, especially

19:45.180 --> 19:50.800
with the upcoming systems now, a whole bunch of speculation on dates and stuff.

19:50.800 --> 19:55.760
One of the things that was reported this week is that it's been confirmed by a couple places

19:55.760 --> 20:02.000
is that the release for the revolution is going to be June 2006, which ties in both

20:02.000 --> 20:09.620
it's the beginning of the new financial year for Nintendo, and it's also been confirmed

20:09.620 --> 20:14.480
by some other hardware sources, people are doing the chip manufacturing and stuff.

20:14.480 --> 20:18.240
So that would be interesting, but the price point, though, is kind of up in the air.

20:18.240 --> 20:23.280
But that doesn't mean that EB Games can't put a pre-order thing on their site.

20:23.280 --> 20:33.840
So I believe the price point is, right now they have Zelda Revolution, which is not even

20:33.840 --> 20:37.280
confirmed to be an actual game that's even in existence.

20:37.280 --> 20:40.840
Even if it was in existence, they're not going to release it two months after...

20:40.840 --> 20:47.360
Oh my gosh, I'm so embarrassed, I can't remember the name of the new Zelda game all of a sudden.

20:47.360 --> 20:48.360
You mean Twilight Princess?

20:48.360 --> 20:51.360
Yes, Twilight Princess, oh my god.

20:51.360 --> 20:53.160
I just lost major nerd points there.

20:53.160 --> 20:55.200
They're not going to release it two months after Twilight Princess.

20:55.200 --> 20:56.700
I'll put it this way, okay?

20:56.700 --> 21:00.040
First off, there is no Zelda Revolution, at least not anything that's coming out next

21:00.040 --> 21:02.160
year at all.

21:02.160 --> 21:08.200
What it's going to be is it's going to be just Zelda Twilight Princess with Revolution

21:08.200 --> 21:09.200
support.

21:09.200 --> 21:12.080
They're going to have added support added into the game, so if you have Revolution you

21:12.080 --> 21:13.080
can do funky stuff and stuff.

21:13.080 --> 21:16.560
Right, I like the old Game Boy, Oracle of Seasons and stuff, that sort of thing.

21:16.560 --> 21:17.560
Yeah, stuff like that.

21:17.560 --> 21:25.960
But, what you can do is you can actually pre-order some stuff with your Revolution in a bundle.

21:25.960 --> 21:32.680
Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles, Mario Revolution, Metroid Prime 3, Super Smash Bros. Revolution,

21:32.680 --> 21:36.360
and you can reserve those for $240.

21:36.360 --> 21:40.560
Which is interesting seeing as none of those games are even confirmed to exist.

21:40.560 --> 21:42.560
I know, that's kind of weird.

21:42.560 --> 21:43.560
They're just trying to get people to agree with it.

21:43.560 --> 21:48.440
That's like saying, ah, I want to pre-order Grand Theft Auto 5.

21:48.440 --> 21:54.520
But the other thing, which was very interesting, is the PlayStation 3.

21:54.520 --> 21:59.280
And there's been a lot of, you know, when's this thing coming out 2?

21:59.280 --> 22:04.360
And now there's a rumor going around that's saying that it's not going to be until 2007,

22:04.360 --> 22:05.360
and because they had some...

22:05.360 --> 22:06.360
No, they wouldn't.

22:06.360 --> 22:07.360
That would be crazy.

22:07.360 --> 22:10.440
2007 do the hardware failures because apparently the system

22:11.480 --> 22:14.280
you know all a normal PlayStation 2 and

22:15.640 --> 22:17.640
PlayStation they get a little hot

22:18.720 --> 22:20.640
Wow

22:20.640 --> 22:25.560
That would really stink if they push that back to 2007. That would be oh, but of course

22:25.560 --> 22:32.040
This is you know a friend of you know, I heard it from somebody who for some way out and that's that's crap then so

22:32.040 --> 22:36.520
yeah it's very interesting stuff though

22:36.520 --> 22:38.280
I'm glad you have some news about the

22:38.280 --> 22:39.700
other consoles because a lot of people

22:39.700 --> 22:42.040
are still like OMG Xbox 360 so it's nice

22:42.040 --> 22:43.040
to see what the other guys are up to

22:43.040 --> 22:44.600
right now because I'll tell you what if

22:44.600 --> 22:45.920
that room somebody brought this up on

22:45.920 --> 22:47.520
our three-hour program this week where

22:47.520 --> 22:49.160
they're saying that you're not going to

22:49.160 --> 22:52.480
be able to get a plus package the

22:52.480 --> 22:54.820
$400 one unless you pre-ordered it if

22:54.820 --> 22:56.040
that turns out to be true I'm gonna be

22:56.040 --> 22:58.480
so mad. Most of them were made so mad. Most of

22:58.480 --> 23:03.480
of the boxes going out were the Xbox 360 system,

23:03.960 --> 23:07.000
not the core system, and so they didn't really make

23:07.000 --> 23:09.400
that many to begin with, and I don't think that they're,

23:09.400 --> 23:12.040
it's all based on pre-orders, so these stores,

23:12.040 --> 23:14.440
you know, if they ordered that many core systems

23:14.440 --> 23:16.220
to come in, then that's what they're getting,

23:16.220 --> 23:18.160
but it's not gonna be like, we wanted to bring in

23:18.160 --> 23:20.960
some systems, here's some core systems instead,

23:20.960 --> 23:23.320
because, you know, that'd be like,

23:23.320 --> 23:25.280
that'd be like going to your store, you know,

23:25.280 --> 23:28.440
and oh, I'm gonna be selling a bunch of Pentium 4 PCs,

23:28.440 --> 23:32.160
Oh, sorry, we sent you Pentium 3 PCs, you know, deal.

23:32.160 --> 23:34.000
So that's not gonna happen.

23:34.000 --> 23:35.520
You know how I feel about pre-ordering

23:35.520 --> 23:37.020
and I have this really hard idea

23:37.020 --> 23:39.160
believing that they would put off major retailers

23:39.160 --> 23:40.760
like Toys R Us and Best Buy

23:40.760 --> 23:42.840
by shafting them with just the $300.

23:42.840 --> 23:46.320
Best Buy is only getting about 50 per store.

23:46.320 --> 23:47.140
That is it.

23:47.140 --> 23:50.120
So you're gonna have some major trouble finding one

23:50.120 --> 23:51.480
launch day.

23:51.480 --> 23:54.480
I really am saying it's gonna be short-handed

23:54.480 --> 23:59.480
and as it is, eBay, they're already up to $480 to $600

24:00.320 --> 24:04.640
for guaranteed getting them on launch day, free books, so.

24:06.120 --> 24:06.960
Crazy.

24:06.960 --> 24:07.800
Crazy.

24:07.800 --> 24:10.600
I'm gonna be pissed if that happens.

24:10.600 --> 24:13.000
Watch me, I will rant on this program.

24:13.000 --> 24:13.840
Anyway.

24:15.260 --> 24:16.360
I better get mine.

24:16.360 --> 24:18.760
It's paid for completely, so.

24:18.760 --> 24:21.040
All right, moving on.

24:21.040 --> 24:23.200
Let's go to the mailbox because I went ahead

24:23.200 --> 24:26.560
open up the mailbox this week. I know this is usually DarkSakura's task, but she gave

24:26.560 --> 24:33.320
me permission to open up the mailbox this week. Read some emails sent at togo at orangelaunchradio.com

24:33.320 --> 24:40.720
is our mailbox. So let's open up the mailbag and see what's going on. We have an email

24:40.720 --> 24:46.380
from Dallas, who actually lives in Salt Lake City, and Dallas wrote us to tell us that

24:46.380 --> 24:49.880
they were listening to the last podcast, and we mentioned about the congressional bill

24:49.880 --> 24:56.920
about how all TVs must be digital, or TV stations need to be broadcast only in digital by 2008.

24:56.920 --> 25:00.060
Digital is not the same as HD, is what Dallas wants to clarify.

25:00.060 --> 25:04.420
So all TVs by 2008 need to be able to receive a digital signal.

25:04.420 --> 25:08.680
It doesn't mean the TVs need to receive an HD signal, which is completely different.

25:08.680 --> 25:12.480
And basically, any TV can receive a digital signal with a converter from Radio Shack.

25:12.480 --> 25:16.080
And if you already get digital cable or satellite, then you're already set.

25:16.080 --> 25:21.520
In fact, all current game consoles are digital, so all next-gen consoles will be digital as

25:21.520 --> 25:22.520
well.

25:22.520 --> 25:25.960
But it seems only the 360 and PS3 will have HD capabilities.

25:25.960 --> 25:28.000
HD is a completely different monster.

25:28.000 --> 25:31.620
I used to have this misperception with digital and HD was the same thing, and I think many

25:31.620 --> 25:33.560
people have the same misperception.

25:33.560 --> 25:35.040
Hope that clarifies things.

25:35.040 --> 25:38.780
I thought they were broadcasting HD, I thought everything was going HD.

25:38.780 --> 25:43.040
I was under that misimpression too, that I thought it wasn't so much that I misunderstood

25:43.040 --> 25:45.320
that there was a difference between digital and HD.

25:45.320 --> 25:47.760
I thought that the bill was telling them they'd have to do HD.

25:47.760 --> 25:52.140
I thought it was supposed to be HD because everything is going into that format now.

25:52.140 --> 25:53.420
It's going to be all widescreen.

25:53.420 --> 25:55.680
It's what everything is going into.

25:55.680 --> 26:03.080
That's why, because older TVs can't support that, but hey, more power to you if it's just

26:03.080 --> 26:04.080
digital.

26:04.080 --> 26:07.840
Honestly, if you're going to go to the next step with your TV any time in the next few

26:07.840 --> 26:12.280
years, you ought to just get an HD anyway, because they're getting more and more affordable.

26:12.280 --> 26:18.200
I've mentioned to a few of my friends, I'm modifying my cabinet, my MAME cabinet at home

26:18.200 --> 26:23.020
to support HD, in other words I'm ripping the top off of it so I can put a widescreen

26:23.020 --> 26:24.020
TV in there.

26:24.020 --> 26:25.020
Awesome.

26:25.020 --> 26:26.020
Yeah.

26:26.020 --> 26:27.020
Good luck with that.

26:27.020 --> 26:28.020
Alright, let's go to another email.

26:28.020 --> 26:32.340
This is from one of our serial emailers, Rob, but we like him, he always has a lot of good

26:32.340 --> 26:33.340
stuff to say.

26:33.340 --> 26:37.540
He wants to give us a useless bit of trivia for the game Grip Shift.

26:37.540 --> 26:41.500
actually an easter egg if you watch the credits of grip shift all the way

26:41.500 --> 26:47.220
through you get a recipe at the end that's kind of cool what's the recipe

26:47.220 --> 26:51.100
for it didn't say in the email but I think it's on our forums so go check out

26:51.100 --> 26:56.980
the forums all right and last up we got an email from Polly and this actually

26:56.980 --> 27:01.700
relates to something that's going on in the news right now I did the ultra mix

27:01.700 --> 27:07.360
three and extreme two and karaoke revolution tour the DDR and karaoke

27:07.360 --> 27:11.440
revolution tour that's going on in some of the malls poly wrote us because he

27:11.440 --> 27:15.880
wants to say that he actually went and I want to describe the setup a little bit

27:15.880 --> 27:19.940
it was a small stage set up with DDR extreme to set up southwest of the stage

27:19.940 --> 27:24.120
and Ultramix 3 set up south southeast unfortunately they didn't have

27:24.120 --> 27:28.480
metal pads just the official sticky pads ex2 and the Ultramix 3 have a bunch of

27:28.480 --> 27:34.480
Although Xtreme 2 seems to stick to the DDR feel and UltraMix 3 seems to have a bigger variety to me,

27:34.480 --> 27:37.480
both seem like good games to get for DDR Bamani fans.

27:37.480 --> 27:41.480
The stage itself had a single softpad and kiosk for Karaoke Revolution,

27:41.480 --> 27:44.480
where you could choose to sing a song solo, duet, or sing and dance.

27:44.480 --> 27:47.480
The list of songs to sing was alright, I think. Wish there were more.

27:47.480 --> 27:52.480
After singing on stage, you got the promised CD recording of yourself and a Karaoke Revolution t-shirt,

27:52.480 --> 27:57.480
but the guy said, um, set it up weird so the recording turned up really awful, he said.

27:57.480 --> 28:03.200
said. Other free things that he got included the Xtreme 2 and UltraMix 3 v-rare samplers

28:03.200 --> 28:08.720
and the DDR t-shirt. The t-shirts are white and ash, white for DDR, ash for Karaoke Revolution,

28:08.720 --> 28:15.000
and have the logos on the front. Very interesting. Also says at the end here, but for the lucky

28:15.000 --> 28:18.880
people in Illinois, Massachusetts, and New Jersey areas where this tour is going next,

28:18.880 --> 28:24.280
I say go to this event for some free DDR stuff, a chance to win $5,000 and to help those no

28:24.280 --> 28:29.600
energy workers promote balani games sounds like fun so check that out if you happen to

28:29.600 --> 28:33.960

shout line.

28:56.360 --> 28:57.360

29:11.060 --> 29:12.060

29:13.060 --> 29:14.060
Alright, we'll ban you.

29:16.060 --> 29:17.060

29:17.060 --> 29:25.260
Anyway, check that out and OLRPSP.com again is really meant for your PSP.

29:25.260 --> 29:30.340
I mean, you can bring it up in Internet Explorer or Firefox, but it's just not as cool.

29:30.340 --> 29:31.820
Trust me, bring it up on your PSP.

29:31.820 --> 29:34.340
It's awesome looking.

29:34.340 --> 29:39.460
So you know the big tour that's going around the country or, well, I'm going to be using

29:39.460 --> 29:44.600
past tense terms pretty soon, Video Games Live, the one that was being co-produced by

29:44.600 --> 29:49.880
Tommy Tallarico G4 TV personality and composer of music for certain games it

29:49.880 --> 29:55.280
got cancelled the whole damn thing got cancelled except for well they do you

29:55.280 --> 29:58.220
know a couple show they did they ended up doing the shows and I think Spokane

29:58.220 --> 30:02.220
and Vancouver but they cancelled all the rest or at least you know they say well

30:02.220 --> 30:07.420
they kind of may be postponing them to 2006 but bottom story long story short

30:07.420 --> 30:10.820
you got to go back get your tickets refunded and guess what that ticket

30:10.820 --> 30:18.980
master handling fee non-refundable you got screwed out of 450 yeah I I think

30:18.980 --> 30:22.460
this is really weird though because I seem to remember that they made this big

30:22.460 --> 30:26.180
hubble ooh about postponing the dates and I bet if we went in the older

30:26.180 --> 30:29.780
podcast we find where we were talking about this even where they were adding

30:29.780 --> 30:34.260
more dates because of demand and now they're saying they're canceling them

30:34.260 --> 30:38.460
because they thought more people would be supportive of the concept and there

30:38.460 --> 30:41.220
just wasn't enough interest generated in these shows I think they really

30:41.220 --> 30:49.860
underestimated how much people hate Tommy Tarlet you're mean but I I was

30:49.860 --> 30:52.780
turned off by the fact they said they were gonna play music from like pong and

30:52.780 --> 30:58.460
Donkey Kong and I'm sitting here going what I mean it's no music in pong I it

30:58.460 --> 31:04.060
was supposed to be inspired by pong or so that's crap yeah that's a bunch of

31:04.060 --> 31:07.060
maybe maybe I'm maybe I'm just reading rumors or something I don't want to get

31:07.060 --> 31:10.020
like quoted or nasty emails and stuff but seriously they were talking about

31:10.020 --> 31:14.740
playing music from these old old old 80s games that had no music I know that like

31:14.740 --> 31:18.140
Donkey Kong or something was on there and I'm just thinking what now some of

31:18.140 --> 31:20.940
the other stuff might have been cool like Metal Gear Solid and stuff but I

31:20.940 --> 31:27.340
bet Squeenix is pointing and laughing going dear friends was a big success

31:27.340 --> 31:32.500
more friends plagued with sound problems and got panned by the video game

31:32.500 --> 31:35.220
community because we didn't know how to put on a show at the Hollywood

31:35.220 --> 31:39.020
empathy or wherever the hell that thing was we went to universal thing but

31:39.020 --> 31:42.300
at least that place was sold out

31:42.300 --> 31:46.660
with their exploding sound board

31:46.660 --> 31:50.100
yeah you know it was so cool because they'd have like the one wing angel and

31:50.100 --> 31:54.500
out come the black mages you know doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo

31:54.500 --> 31:54.920
and then

31:54.920 --> 31:59.300
like this random wood thing falling

31:59.300 --> 32:05.160
that was awful you know we like to talk about video games and movie

32:05.160 --> 32:11.160
and vice versa. Clock Tower 3 is going to have a film made out of it. Script writer

32:11.160 --> 32:20.160
Todd Farmer, who by the way wrote Jason X a few years ago, oh wow, has been approached

32:20.160 --> 32:23.920
by the Mayhem Project to helm an adaptation of Clock Tower 3.

32:23.920 --> 32:30.160
I have full faith in him now. Jason X was awesome. No granted though, if anyone's going

32:30.160 --> 32:35.040
to pull off a Jason in space movie, it would be him I guess.

32:35.040 --> 32:41.040
Dewey Ball is going to split the Dungeon Siege movie, Kill Bill style.

32:41.040 --> 32:42.040
Very interesting.

32:42.040 --> 32:45.440
This movie is going to be like four hours long, so they're splitting it into two parts.

32:45.440 --> 32:49.180
You want to know how long originally this movie is supposed to be?

32:49.180 --> 32:55.360
He said that it was basically the original script, and the script that he apparently

32:55.360 --> 32:59.360
is going by right now is 485 pages long.

32:59.360 --> 33:00.360
So...

33:00.360 --> 33:01.360
Hold on.

33:01.360 --> 33:02.360
Huh?

33:02.360 --> 33:03.360
Huh?

33:03.360 --> 33:04.360
Huh?

33:04.360 --> 33:05.360
Lord of the Rings ripoff!

33:05.360 --> 33:10.840
Okay, 485 pages long, and you know in scriptwriting, each page is supposed to be about an 8 hour

33:10.840 --> 33:11.840
long movie.

33:11.840 --> 33:13.640
Oh my God.

33:13.640 --> 33:20.040
So I guess the first part is going to be called In the Name of the King, and it will be out

33:20.040 --> 33:25.760
November 3rd, 2006, but then the conclusion will be out December 1st, 2006, but it's going

33:25.760 --> 33:27.660
to be like one month in between.

33:27.660 --> 33:32.460
I'm willing to give it a chance, but I'm kind of like, is this only getting made because

33:32.460 --> 33:33.460
of Lord of the Rings?

33:33.460 --> 33:36.340
Is it going to be a subpar clone?

33:36.340 --> 33:37.660
Was it BloodRayne?

33:37.660 --> 33:39.740
The reviews before have been horrible.

33:39.740 --> 33:40.740
Horrible.

33:40.740 --> 33:45.040
Alright, let's talk about something cool.

33:45.040 --> 33:46.320
Let's talk about Starship Troopers.

33:46.320 --> 33:47.640
Now that was a cool movie.

33:47.640 --> 33:50.140
Well Starship Troopers is being, I think it was a cool movie.

33:50.140 --> 33:51.140
It was okay.

33:51.140 --> 33:54.420
It was cheesy, but it was good.

33:54.420 --> 33:57.140
It's being turned into a PC game.

33:57.140 --> 33:59.140
You're not supposed to be turned into a PC game like a long-ass.

33:59.140 --> 34:01.140
Well, it's finally happening.

34:01.140 --> 34:06.140
It's coming out in, it went in gold, and it's coming out here in November.

34:06.140 --> 34:12.140
In 2000, I guess in 2000 they had a first Starship Troopers base game,

34:12.140 --> 34:19.140
but this is a new one that is basically doing a first-person perspective type thing.

34:19.140 --> 34:20.140
Interesting.

34:20.140 --> 34:24.140
Caspar Van Diem, by the way, who is in the film, will be doing voiceover commentary in the game.

34:24.140 --> 34:25.140
Because he doesn't get any work.

34:25.140 --> 34:32.980
that's right any other news for us Loki oh let me see yeah um yeah I know of

34:32.980 --> 34:39.500
course there's stuff the first being stuff for the PSP of course the big

34:39.500 --> 34:46.620
thing that everybody's been you know up in arms about is the brand new actually

34:46.620 --> 34:51.060
well for example SOCOM they have voice chat in it so now they are going to be

34:51.060 --> 35:00.020
offering pretty soon a headset for chatting via the game over the internet just like you

35:00.020 --> 35:06.340
would with anybody else playing SOCOM on your PS2 or what not.

35:06.340 --> 35:10.580
So that's going to be coming out pretty soon which is kind of cool.

35:10.580 --> 35:18.660
The other thing was they were talking a little bit on the Resident Evil DS stuff which looks

35:18.660 --> 35:28.460
really weird. I'm always kind of concerned with the quirky gameplay of the DS with Resident

35:28.460 --> 35:31.740
Evil. I'm just not seeing it.

35:31.740 --> 35:40.820
Resident Evil Deadly Silence. Damn you people and your DS. God, every freaking franchise

35:40.820 --> 35:46.900
that's gone over to DS had to be like Drill Spirits or Dawn of Sorrow. It's like, God,

35:46.900 --> 35:51.300
We get it, it's a DS game.

35:51.300 --> 35:56.280
It's coming out, by the way, in mid-January in Japan, but I'm sure we'll get it here.

35:56.280 --> 35:57.280
Of course.

35:57.280 --> 36:00.780
Of course, touch screens, features, and controls and stuff.

36:00.780 --> 36:03.500
You know it's actually a remake of the original Resident Evil, but they just, you know, they

36:03.500 --> 36:04.780
changed a whole bunch.

36:04.780 --> 36:08.300
How many times have they remade the original Resident Evil now?

36:08.300 --> 36:09.300
Too many.

36:09.300 --> 36:13.380
What about the great voice acting?

36:13.380 --> 36:15.380
when I end up in a Jill's sandwich.

36:15.380 --> 36:20.380
I don't think that'd be so bad.

36:20.380 --> 36:26.760
Anyways, really the other big thing that was coming out actually is the add-on for Half

36:26.760 --> 36:35.260
Life 2, Lost Coast, and it's actually available now via Steam, which is definitely the way

36:35.260 --> 36:36.260
you can download it.

36:36.260 --> 36:43.020
It supposedly has some graphical updates to it, new volumetric lighting, and just overall

36:43.020 --> 36:47.080
you know half-life 2 sexy so that's all you really need to know the other big

36:47.080 --> 36:53.940
the other big thing actually if games coming out would be thq's lineup for the

36:53.940 --> 36:58.280
360 and everybody's like you know looking forward to Saints Row which is

36:58.280 --> 37:01.240
supposed to be the Grand Theft Auto or one of the Grand Theft Auto games now

37:01.240 --> 37:06.920
for the 360 oh yeah another one yeah too bad you know what I think you'll see

37:06.920 --> 37:11.000
this game about the same time you'll see a PlayStation 3 and that would be in

37:11.000 --> 37:14.040
two thousand seven so i keep on waiting

37:14.040 --> 37:19.120
uh... and also the other game the outfit uh... won't be seen till two thousand

37:19.120 --> 37:23.020
six but i could've told you that

37:23.020 --> 37:26.120
why am i getting so upset about not being able to get an xbox three sixty on

37:26.120 --> 37:29.600
launch day because there's gonna be no freaking games at home. All your launch titles are

37:29.600 --> 37:30.920
coming out in november

37:30.920 --> 37:33.660
uh... you're not going to be seeing anything new until

37:33.660 --> 37:36.640
january and so far everything that's been announced for january

37:36.640 --> 37:38.160
the godfather

37:38.160 --> 37:42.120
which is uh... one of the games is coming out and i believe uh... there's

37:42.120 --> 37:44.560
another game that was pushed back to that date

37:44.560 --> 37:46.100
of nba uh...

37:46.100 --> 37:49.620
or college hoops two thousand six the uh...

37:49.620 --> 37:50.880
elder scrolls

37:50.880 --> 37:55.120
elder scrolls is in december the first week of december so we do get a december game

37:55.120 --> 37:58.400
it's going to be awesome but um...

37:58.400 --> 38:01.880
you know it's really sad that uh... this is everything that's come out it's going

38:01.880 --> 38:05.120
to be you know ds psp syndrome you know where

38:05.120 --> 38:08.200
the system launches with a ton of tiles and then you're like, okay, wow, all those games

38:08.200 --> 38:09.200
are cool.

38:09.200 --> 38:10.600
What do you got for me next?

38:10.600 --> 38:11.600
We got nothing.

38:11.600 --> 38:16.080
Maybe, now I'm starting to reconsider if I really need to buy into this hype on the launch.

38:16.080 --> 38:21.000
Buy Second Wave is coming out first, second week in January.

38:21.000 --> 38:22.000
That's when you can get your 360.

38:22.000 --> 38:23.000
We'll see.

38:23.000 --> 38:24.000
I'll think about it.

38:24.000 --> 38:25.640
I'll think about it.

38:25.640 --> 38:31.920
News on Final Fantasy 3DS, of course, from MeToo Magazine, which always seems to get

38:31.920 --> 38:35.080
a lot of great news on the games first.

38:35.080 --> 38:37.840
Basically what happened is that they were kind of talking about why the game took so

38:37.840 --> 38:43.920
long to be redone and what it is is that, well it used to be, it was first a Famicom

38:43.920 --> 38:47.800
game and it was only developed by a really small team of people.

38:47.800 --> 38:51.720
However, Final Fantasy 3 used some complicated programming techniques that really couldn't

38:51.720 --> 38:55.300
be ported to a handheld gaming machine until now.

38:55.300 --> 38:58.240
So what they did is since it went so long without an upgrade, they decided to do some

38:58.240 --> 39:01.200
graphical upgrades for Final Fantasy 3.

39:01.200 --> 39:05.040
Not to be confused you guys with the American Final Fantasy 3 which was actually Final Fantasy

39:05.040 --> 39:09.880
Okay, they're gonna remake the Japanese Final Fantasy 3 and call it Final Fantasy 3 on the

39:09.880 --> 39:10.880
DS.

39:10.880 --> 39:14.040
It's gonna have sort of 3D graphics.

39:14.040 --> 39:18.240
It's gonna be like virtual 3D graphics, so you can't really like rotate the maps on demand

39:18.240 --> 39:21.800
or anything, but you can still like zoom in and out and stuff, and they're gonna redo

39:21.800 --> 39:25.760
the characters and some of the technology and they will incorporate a little bit of

39:25.760 --> 39:27.240
touch screen into it.

39:27.240 --> 39:30.880
Think 3D as in Final Fantasy 7.

39:30.880 --> 39:35.480
also in the original Nintendo one the four main characters really didn't have

39:35.480 --> 39:39.600
any personalities but in the DS remake they are going to get some new

39:39.600 --> 39:43.240
personalities that are going to impact the storyline so it's basically going to

39:43.240 --> 39:49.600
be this whole new game it sounds like so should be fun awesome I'm definitely

39:49.600 --> 39:55.360
gonna pick that up also I gotta say it's one more they there will be wireless

39:55.360 --> 39:57.880
capability

39:57.880 --> 40:01.560
but it's going to be, they won't say how, but it's going to use the wireless

40:01.560 --> 40:04.480
capability for some sort of bonus

40:04.480 --> 40:06.060
interesting

40:06.060 --> 40:08.280
couple last news stories for you guys tonight

40:08.280 --> 40:12.720
unless you have anything else, Loki? I have stuff, of course. Then finish up

40:12.720 --> 40:16.480
because all I've got left is the funny stuff. Okay, okay, well the first

40:16.480 --> 40:19.320
thing I've got and this is kind of cool

40:19.320 --> 40:24.200
if you're a fan of, you know, playing the old arcade games and you

40:24.200 --> 40:28.920
thinking about getting a MAME cabinet, well think no further. All you have to do now is

40:28.920 --> 40:33.940
go to your local Target. That's right, Target's going to be selling stand-up arcade machines

40:33.940 --> 40:41.280
starting in November. The 62-inch tall arcade cabinets featuring midway games such as Joust,

40:41.280 --> 40:49.240
Rampage, Defender, and Root Beer Tapper will be available under $500. And that's pretty

40:49.240 --> 40:54.440
pretty interesting. You know what, kids? Just spend forty bucks on arcade treasures one

40:54.440 --> 41:00.580
and two. Or spend sixty and get one, two, and three. And just tilt your TV a little

41:00.580 --> 41:06.280
bit and maybe spend another twenty dollars on an arcade style joystick in your set.

41:06.280 --> 41:12.360
And in news that I'd like to classify as no shit, the Zelda 3 game that was available

41:12.360 --> 41:22.120
on eBay, yeah that was fake. Not the real Zelda 3 game. So yeah, that's kind of interesting.

41:22.120 --> 41:30.600
And then finally, I don't know why, but Pac-Man and Pac-Man World 3 is giving his own voice.

41:30.600 --> 41:38.820
Who will be voicing him? But Martin T. Sherman, who had voiced such games as Driver 3, Second

41:38.820 --> 41:43.440
site. Oh wow, what an impressive resume. And TimeSplitters Future Perfect, which by the

41:43.440 --> 41:50.600
way is a very underrated game. But really awesome, and personally I think Pac-Man World

41:50.600 --> 41:55.960
3 is going to suck, but anyways. So why did you say it was really awesome? I don't know.

41:55.960 --> 42:01.600
I was... You were still thinking about TimeSplitters? I was still thinking about it, exactly. Alright,

42:01.600 --> 42:06.880
I have a couple WTF stories for you guys.

42:06.880 --> 42:10.140
Tamagotchi DS, I think we reported on this a few months ago.

42:10.140 --> 42:14.140
We talked about Tamagotchi Corner Store, which was coming out in Japan.

42:14.140 --> 42:15.860
Guess what?

42:15.860 --> 42:17.800
It's coming out in the US.

42:17.800 --> 42:19.480
They are going to bring this game out in the US.

42:19.480 --> 42:21.280
Guess when it's coming out?

42:21.280 --> 42:22.740
This fall.

42:22.740 --> 42:25.360
Like soon, very soon.

42:25.360 --> 42:28.240
So I guess secretly this whole time they're reporting it to the US.

42:28.240 --> 42:33.740
So it is coming out here and they're saying that the original Tamagotchi struck a chord

42:33.740 --> 42:38.140
with kids who wanted a toy that complimented their active lifestyle and these virtual pets

42:38.140 --> 42:40.320
were the perfect answer.

42:40.320 --> 42:43.780
Tamagotchi provides the nurturing play pattern with the electronic component and portability

42:43.780 --> 42:47.000
that allows kids to take the toy with them wherever they go.

42:47.000 --> 42:52.660
This coming from Rain Rice of the Toy Industry Association.

42:52.660 --> 42:57.100
Now what I do think is kind of cool about this is that it is actually being designed

42:57.100 --> 43:01.200
by Nana Oncha, who made Parappa the Rapper.

43:01.200 --> 43:06.440
So I'm not completely laughing at this game just yet, because it's Tamagotchi related,

43:06.440 --> 43:12.280
because you know, Parappa changed, you know, Parappa provided, you could say we would not

43:12.280 --> 43:15.120
have music games today if it weren't for Parappa.

43:15.120 --> 43:16.120
You could say that, I don't know.

43:16.120 --> 43:17.720
Can I mention one more thing here?

43:17.720 --> 43:18.720
Oh sure.

43:18.720 --> 43:22.220
One of the things that I was really pissed off about was the backwards compatibility

43:22.220 --> 43:23.220
with the 360.

43:23.220 --> 43:25.720
And I was like, why is it only supporting 20 games?

43:25.720 --> 43:26.720
That's retarded.

43:26.720 --> 43:27.720
What?

43:27.720 --> 43:29.840
I didn't hear that they finally said it was only going to support 20 games.

43:29.840 --> 43:33.960
Well that's initially what they threw out there about the first week of course, then

43:33.960 --> 43:36.800
each week there's more and more support it.

43:36.800 --> 43:42.040
But one of the reasons they're doing this is like for example games like Halo 2, they're

43:42.040 --> 43:47.200
going to be getting better graphics when they're hitting the 360, I mean graphic enhancements

43:47.200 --> 43:48.780
and whatnot.

43:48.780 --> 43:53.300
So that's kind of something to look forward to, they're actually redoing the graphics

43:53.300 --> 43:59.300
are enhancing them like they should have been, like with the Playstation 2, which was interesting.

43:59.300 --> 44:05.800
A little bit better graphics on the Playstation 2 when you're playing the Playstation 1 games.

44:05.800 --> 44:08.980
So that is how they're going to do it? They're going to release so many games a week for

44:08.980 --> 44:13.280
backwards compatibility? Yeah, basically here's... I still have yet to really hear like a clear

44:13.280 --> 44:19.540
definitive answer. It's going to be, well, what I heard was it's about 20, the numbers

44:19.540 --> 44:26.100
they were throwing out about 15 to 25 of the top titles right now are going to be starting

44:26.100 --> 44:31.220
the first week. Each week there's going to be more titles added to the list of compatibility.

44:31.220 --> 44:36.580
You have to have a system with a hard drive and you have to have an Xbox Live account

44:36.580 --> 44:41.460
I think. Interesting. I'm not sure if it's a Live Gold account because that would be

44:41.460 --> 44:47.880
really cheap of them but I wouldn't put it past them.

44:47.880 --> 44:55.520
last story I have tonight, Gamasutra ran a story earlier this week that talks about several

44:55.520 --> 45:00.840
executives of the company that is producing and distributing the Gizmondo.

45:00.840 --> 45:07.280
Supposedly they are connected to organized crime, the mob, Swedish, so the mob made your

45:07.280 --> 45:08.280
Gizmondo.

45:08.280 --> 45:12.160
Yes, they're connected to the Swedish mob supposedly and all this stuff.

45:12.160 --> 45:17.200
Of course, you know, they use the word alleged and all that stuff, but wouldn't that be interesting

45:17.200 --> 45:19.600
that the Gizmondo was actually funded by the mob.

45:19.600 --> 45:22.960
It doesn't save it from being kind of crappy, which is what all the reviews are saying,

45:22.960 --> 45:26.640
is that the game is crappy, crappy, crappy, or not the game, the system, and all its games

45:26.640 --> 45:27.760
are crappy, crappy.

45:27.760 --> 45:32.520
I have yet to put my hands on it, so I won't, you know, I'll withhold final judgment, but

45:32.520 --> 45:37.200
rumor is this is going to go down in history somewhere next to the end gauge.

45:37.200 --> 45:38.200
Sad.

45:38.200 --> 45:39.200
Finally, this is...

45:39.200 --> 45:40.920
Hey, you already had your final shot!

45:40.920 --> 45:41.920
Alright, fine.

45:41.920 --> 45:42.920
One more.

45:42.920 --> 45:43.920
What do you want?

45:43.920 --> 45:46.240
This is kind of old news because, you know, when people are downloading this, this won't

45:46.240 --> 45:53.120
apply to them anymore, but this weekend was the Nintendogs kind of event going on at GameStop

45:53.120 --> 46:01.480
where you can actually download some new star glasses for your dog, and a special greeting

46:01.480 --> 46:04.560
by Haley Duff.

46:04.560 --> 46:07.360
Oh God!

46:07.360 --> 46:10.200
So yeah, and it's...

46:10.200 --> 46:11.960
I'm glad my dogs are dead.

46:11.960 --> 46:18.680
Well, this is part of the event dubbed the Nintendo's Tricks and Treats Weekend, and

46:18.680 --> 46:23.980
Nintendo and GameStop are donating $50,000 to the American Society for the Prevention

46:23.980 --> 46:25.240
of Cruelty to Animals.

46:25.240 --> 46:29.800
Well, if all I get out of it is a crappy message from Hayley Duff, then I'm glad I let my dog

46:29.800 --> 46:33.720
starve for the past three weeks, because I haven't played that game at all.

46:33.720 --> 46:38.000
I haven't fed my dog at all, so I'm done with that game.

46:38.000 --> 46:39.440
Good thing it's not real.

46:39.440 --> 46:42.000
Anyway, final thoughts, we're about done with the show.

46:42.000 --> 46:43.600
Final thoughts, Loki?

46:43.600 --> 46:48.000
I need to play Shadow Colossus this week, for sure.

46:48.000 --> 46:48.840
Me too.

46:48.840 --> 46:53.060
Otherwise, gonna be playing more, more, more warriors.

46:53.960 --> 46:57.040
My final thought is, I need to not feed my dogs,

46:57.040 --> 47:00.600
I need to feed myself right now, because I'm very hungry.
