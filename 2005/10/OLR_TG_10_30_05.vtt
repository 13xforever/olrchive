00:00.249 --> 00:13.979
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello out there to everybody who's downloading us and checking out the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, our podcast dedicated to video games and gaming podcasts.

00:29.264 --> 00:32.747
[SPEAKER_02]: and news that doesn't suck about these so-called video games.

00:33.908 --> 00:36.530
[SPEAKER_02]: We are here every week for your listening pleasure.

00:37.430 --> 00:38.651
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy Halloween to you guys.

00:39.752 --> 00:42.414
[SPEAKER_02]: Those of you guys that are downloading this on Monday, the day it comes out.

00:43.475 --> 00:45.797
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're downloading this later in the week, I hope you had a good Halloween.

00:46.417 --> 00:48.117
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky.

00:48.437 --> 00:51.658
[SPEAKER_02]: Not joining us tonight is DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

00:51.678 --> 00:57.540
[SPEAKER_02]: She planned on being here, but she had a last minute thing she had to go take care of, so unfortunately she wasn't able to be here for the recording.

00:57.560 --> 00:59.400
[SPEAKER_02]: That's two weeks in a row now, though, we're counting.

01:00.060 --> 01:00.580
[SPEAKER_02]: Shame, shame.

01:00.620 --> 01:01.080
[SPEAKER_02]: Shame, shame.

01:01.120 --> 01:04.841
[SPEAKER_02]: No, she says hi, and she'll be back next week, I'm sure.

01:05.601 --> 01:08.682
[SPEAKER_02]: However, we do have, as always, the one and only Techmaster Loki.

01:08.902 --> 01:09.742
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, I'm here.

01:10.002 --> 01:10.423
[SPEAKER_02]: How you doing?

01:10.783 --> 01:10.963
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.

01:11.563 --> 01:12.143
[SPEAKER_02]: Good, good to hear.

01:13.089 --> 01:13.369
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

01:14.370 --> 01:15.270
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's just get into it.

01:15.310 --> 01:16.891
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about the games we've been playing this week.

01:16.931 --> 01:20.614
[SPEAKER_02]: That's usually how we like to start off the show, by letting you guys know what's going on in our gaming world.

01:21.034 --> 01:27.998
[SPEAKER_02]: And I noticed some of the posts on the forums say, damn, you guys like to play a lot of games, or you guys really seem to play a lot of games.

01:28.499 --> 01:30.680
[SPEAKER_02]: How is it that we're able to play so many games, Loki?

01:30.700 --> 01:31.221
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think?

01:31.441 --> 01:34.423
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think I play that many games, honestly, but... I don't.

01:34.623 --> 01:36.884
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I play like one game a week, usually.

01:37.084 --> 01:37.585
[SPEAKER_01]: And usually...

01:38.445 --> 01:40.086
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll notice, like, for example, Burnout.

01:40.406 --> 01:46.108
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll play it at a month at a time, and then I'll get snippets of games I'll play for like an hour or something just to try them out.

01:46.668 --> 01:47.309
[SPEAKER_01]: That type of thing.

01:47.909 --> 01:50.930
[SPEAKER_01]: And, of course, you know, things are kind of going the same pattern now.

01:51.130 --> 01:58.173
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to get a little crazy in a couple weeks when the 360 comes out because I've got four games on order, so that'll be a little interesting.

01:58.533 --> 01:59.433
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how I do it.

01:59.833 --> 02:03.394
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so much coming out right now that I seem to be buying at least one new game a week.

02:03.414 --> 02:04.634
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's buying, kids.

02:04.734 --> 02:06.314
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't get a lot of this stuff for free.

02:06.334 --> 02:11.755
[SPEAKER_02]: I did get one free game thanks to Loki this week, but we don't really get the hookup or anything, so we actually buy these games.

02:12.575 --> 02:16.056
[SPEAKER_01]: I get a lot of games for free, but I don't play them, to be honest.

02:16.076 --> 02:17.336
[SPEAKER_01]: I just got Castlevania DS.

02:17.796 --> 02:19.077
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to play that because it looks good.

02:20.217 --> 02:22.637
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got some more Dance Dance Revolution Extreme 2.

02:23.657 --> 02:27.258
[SPEAKER_01]: But they had Wallace and Gromit, Curse the Were-Rabbit, and I was like, eh, no.

02:28.092 --> 02:28.892
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to play that game.

02:29.012 --> 02:30.813
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually games based on movies aren't all that great.

02:30.833 --> 02:31.153
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

02:31.173 --> 02:31.793
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some good ones.

02:32.054 --> 02:34.514
[SPEAKER_01]: I can bring one in and give it away or something.

02:34.574 --> 02:34.935
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

02:34.995 --> 02:36.235
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, listeners will like that.

02:36.895 --> 02:39.997
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't get a chance to... I picked up a couple games.

02:40.017 --> 02:45.999
[SPEAKER_01]: I picked up Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories and I played it for like five minutes.

02:46.399 --> 02:51.621
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually Grand Theft Auto I'm just like getting right into it and it's like, oh man, you know, I have to play this game but

02:52.899 --> 02:53.921
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

03:06.304 --> 03:10.365
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just about to ask you how your gaming week was, but I suppose that's a big part of it there, is the Liberty City.

03:25.209 --> 03:31.310
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have enough time to dedicate to Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories because that's a game that requires a lot of time.

03:31.770 --> 03:32.991
[SPEAKER_01]: Same with San Andreas.

03:33.031 --> 03:34.171
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't even finish that game.

03:34.691 --> 03:36.812
[SPEAKER_01]: I just didn't have enough time to dedicate to it.

03:36.972 --> 03:38.312
[SPEAKER_01]: I got bored with it after a while.

03:38.332 --> 03:41.032
[SPEAKER_02]: Once in a while, there's a great game, though, where you make time for it.

03:41.293 --> 03:42.033
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.

03:42.833 --> 03:44.533
[SPEAKER_01]: And that great game is The Warriors.

03:45.013 --> 03:46.054
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that game.

03:46.414 --> 03:47.774
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what you've been playing instead.

03:47.894 --> 03:51.855
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been playing The Warriors this week, and I have to say Rockstar has really...

03:53.673 --> 03:57.316
[SPEAKER_01]: They really did a really good job translating the movie into a game.

03:57.676 --> 04:00.698
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really surprising because I think this...

04:01.414 --> 04:02.075
[SPEAKER_01]: Game of Thrones

04:25.316 --> 04:52.274
[SPEAKER_01]: and just really fun stuff like one of the things I like most about it is this kind of a rumble mode type thing where you go in and do like quick fights and as you go through the game you unlock more fights so it starts off with one-on-one and then war party which is five-on-five and then I just unlocked one that's called arming which is nine-on-nine and it keeps going on with that you unlock more arenas that you can fight in and unlock more gangs and stuff

04:52.774 --> 04:54.155
[SPEAKER_01]: and overall, the game's really fun.

04:54.215 --> 04:56.117
[SPEAKER_01]: You can pick up objects and stuff.

04:56.177 --> 05:01.262
[SPEAKER_01]: I was mugging a guy and I threw a trash can in his head or threw a police officer through a window.

05:01.302 --> 05:02.403
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's just really fun.

05:03.163 --> 05:04.785
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, cool.

05:05.125 --> 05:05.846
[SPEAKER_02]: Fun's what it's all about.

05:06.506 --> 05:06.826
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that it?

05:07.427 --> 05:08.488
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all I've been playing.

05:08.688 --> 05:10.950
[SPEAKER_01]: I still haven't gotten a chance to play Shadow of Colossus yet.

05:11.230 --> 05:11.911
[SPEAKER_01]: It's

05:13.276 --> 05:19.519
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been dying to check out that game because our forums have been very active about this game and lit up, and I've heard a lot of great things about it.

05:19.539 --> 05:22.661
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm hoping that that can be on my list for next week, but we'll see.

05:23.502 --> 05:24.503
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be a busy November.

05:25.783 --> 05:27.805
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we have Battlefront 2 coming out this week.

05:28.425 --> 05:29.326
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, tomorrow.

05:30.226 --> 05:31.547
[SPEAKER_01]: Or, no, I should say the first.

05:32.708 --> 05:35.950
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of stuff, and that's going to be a really awesome game.

05:36.390 --> 05:36.490
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

05:37.379 --> 05:39.061
[SPEAKER_02]: My gaming week, I played a couple games this week.

05:39.081 --> 05:41.142
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually played three games, so I'm going to review two of them for you.

05:41.182 --> 05:59.417
[SPEAKER_02]: The one I did not play so much of this week, I bought this, but I haven't really sat down to any extent with this, and that's the Taito collection that's come out recently with Bubble Bobble and Rainbow Islands and Elevator Action and Rastan and all these old kicks and all these old, old games.

05:59.877 --> 06:02.379
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course Space Invaders is on there too.

06:02.399 --> 06:10.203
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to review that on next week's show because I didn't get to play it enough this week because I was too busy with other games, one of them being Soul Calibur 3.

06:11.164 --> 06:13.005
[SPEAKER_02]: Soul Calibur 3 I picked up this week on a whim.

06:14.326 --> 06:17.127
[SPEAKER_02]: Soul Calibur 3 is pretty hot, I gotta say.

06:17.447 --> 06:22.110
[SPEAKER_02]: At first my reaction to Soul Calibur 3 was, this is really more like Soul Calibur 2.5.

06:22.450 --> 06:24.912
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't really feel like...

06:25.592 --> 06:26.313
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura

06:47.569 --> 06:54.594
[SPEAKER_02]: Challenge Mode, I don't remember the official, Soul Battle or something where you just, you do these different types like Deathmatch or coin collecting, these weird modes.

06:54.934 --> 07:17.209
[SPEAKER_02]: But I gotta say, this one mode that really I thought was just so fascinating was the Chronicles of the Sword mode, which is this mode that suddenly Soul Calibur turns into this tactical game where you're moving your characters around trying to capture castles, and when you get into battles, you can actually zoom to the battle and actually have a real Soul Calibur style match, which I thought was a very interesting addition to the game.

07:17.749 --> 07:26.811
[SPEAKER_02]: and you kind of consider that Soul Calibur has kind of been going outside the box for a little while now because they had that mode in Soul Calibur 2 and then the conquest mode in the arcades.

07:27.171 --> 07:27.971
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really cool.

07:28.471 --> 07:32.132
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to make it much more than just a fighting game and I think that's really great.

07:33.212 --> 07:37.953
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, if you are not a fan of fighting games, is Soul Calibur 3 going to have anything new to win you over?

07:38.473 --> 07:39.433
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably not.

07:39.633 --> 07:44.014
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think if you're a fighting games person, Soul Calibur 3 is going to have anything really for you.

07:44.314 --> 07:46.755
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think if you're not a fan of the Soul Calibur series to begin with,

07:47.651 --> 07:47.931
[SPEAKER_02]: and so on.

08:07.781 --> 08:08.942
[SPEAKER_02]: and so on and so forth.

08:31.340 --> 08:32.701
[SPEAKER_02]: But then he designed the outfits.

08:32.901 --> 08:37.984
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's more like you're playing Barbie, Soul Calibur Barbie style, where you're choosing the different outfits and the color for the outfits.

08:38.404 --> 08:40.525
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can still do an awful lot with that.

08:40.585 --> 08:41.526
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's kind of cool.

08:41.566 --> 08:42.646
[SPEAKER_02]: And it makes you laugh.

08:42.666 --> 08:46.609
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we made this one character that doesn't wear pants, but he wears a giant Pope hat.

08:47.830 --> 08:49.631
[SPEAKER_02]: Style Thing, and he's a ninja.

08:50.072 --> 08:51.033
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's really funny.

08:51.874 --> 08:53.255
[SPEAKER_02]: And we gave him like the old man.

08:53.536 --> 08:55.678
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, he's a pantsless pope ninja, and he's awesome.

08:56.298 --> 08:59.582
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, you can have fun with it.

08:59.922 --> 09:00.603
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a cute idea.

09:02.748 --> 09:03.649
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

09:23.884 --> 09:24.645
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's kind of neat.

09:25.265 --> 09:27.367
[SPEAKER_02]: So I do recommend Soul Calibur 3.

09:27.607 --> 09:29.169
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a very solid, great game.

09:29.629 --> 09:34.813
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, if you're a fan of Soul Calibur, you probably already have this game, and if you don't already have it, you need to go get it.

09:34.873 --> 09:40.578
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if you remotely enjoyed the previous Soul Calibur games, especially Soul Calibur 2, you will enjoy Soul Calibur 3.

09:41.018 --> 09:43.280
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just a little upset that they didn't put it in the arcades.

09:43.340 --> 09:44.721
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it would have been a great arcade game.

09:45.041 --> 09:45.602
[SPEAKER_02]: But maybe...

09:46.122 --> 09:57.810
[SPEAKER_02]: Because all the new stuff is very centered around the single player mode, I think if you take just the versus mode without creating a character, there's really not a whole lot different from Soul Calibur 2, save three new characters and some backgrounds.

09:58.350 --> 10:07.596
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I think it is something that, now having played it on the console, I think this is something that they really, you know, there would be no point porting it to the arcade, but...

10:08.376 --> 10:11.678
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, I'm just a little disappointed to see that it didn't continue in the arcade.

10:12.438 --> 10:19.741
[SPEAKER_02]: The other game I checked out this week was Midway Arcade Treasures Part 3 for the Xbox, was the system I played it on.

10:21.602 --> 10:36.890
[SPEAKER_02]: Eight racing games, including Stun Runner, Hydro Thunder, Offroad Thunder, that's what I'm thinking of, and then Iron Man's Offroad, but they took Iron Man out, and now it's just some regular guy, because I guess licensing ran up or whatever.

10:39.429 --> 10:51.993
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason why I was so drawn to this game and I was so excited to play this game was for Iron Man Off-Road because I have very fond memories of dumping a shitload of quarters into a pizzeria arcade machine and just playing this game over and over again.

10:52.233 --> 10:54.754
[SPEAKER_02]: And they even have the track pack one, which I think is awesome.

10:55.154 --> 10:58.355
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was loving it.

10:58.475 --> 10:58.995
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cool.

10:59.115 --> 11:00.176
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a retro trip.

11:00.516 --> 11:03.237
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you kind of know how you feel about those retro collections.

11:03.277 --> 11:06.738
[SPEAKER_02]: If you kind of find them a waste of money, then you're probably not going to get anything new out of this.

11:07.278 --> 11:07.298
[SPEAKER_02]: I

11:07.538 --> 11:19.365
[SPEAKER_02]: I was a little disappointed at first that it's nothing but the racing games, but when you consider that Midway's kind of already packaged all their other stuff and put it in Treasures 1 and 2, which were both very solid collections, this collection's, you know...

11:20.565 --> 11:22.506
[SPEAKER_02]: They made pretty good use out of what they got left.

11:22.946 --> 11:30.129
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I was a little disappointed, though, because Hydro Thunder and Offroad Thunder do not appear to be arcade ports.

11:30.490 --> 11:32.911
[SPEAKER_02]: Or if they are, they sure don't play like them.

11:33.011 --> 11:34.972
[SPEAKER_02]: They feel very console-ish.

11:34.992 --> 11:36.552
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they're ports of the console versions.

11:36.652 --> 11:39.734
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think they're ports of the arcade, which was a little bit disappointing.

11:39.774 --> 11:42.415
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know if maybe the hardware can handle it.

11:42.435 --> 11:43.716
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it should be able to.

11:43.756 --> 11:44.316
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, looking...

11:44.895 --> 11:46.076
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember the hardware versions.

11:46.336 --> 11:47.777
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to love Offroad Thunder.

11:47.797 --> 11:50.459
[SPEAKER_01]: That was my game to play at QZAR and stuff.

11:50.980 --> 11:52.401
[SPEAKER_01]: And it looked amazing.

11:52.461 --> 11:53.221
[SPEAKER_01]: It looked pretty good.

11:54.622 --> 11:55.583
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I can imagine.

11:56.204 --> 11:58.646
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think they're straight arcade ports.

11:58.706 --> 12:01.848
[SPEAKER_02]: Or if they are, they tweaked them so they don't really feel like the arcade.

12:01.908 --> 12:05.591
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was a little sad at that.

12:05.691 --> 12:08.173
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's still a pretty solid buy for $20.

12:08.973 --> 12:10.735
[SPEAKER_02]: If you like racing games, you're going to love this.

12:11.375 --> 12:22.383
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's in that same great interface that they have Part 2 in and I think they went back and updated Part 1 with but Part 2's got a great interface and 3 just kind of continues that.

12:22.423 --> 12:23.664
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's not broke, don't fix it.

12:23.844 --> 12:25.926
[SPEAKER_02]: Xbox Live Aware and all that good stuff if you're on Xbox.

12:27.347 --> 12:30.368
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would... I kind of borderline recommend it.

12:30.528 --> 12:35.709
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that Treasures 2 and Treasures 1 are more must-haves than Treasures 3.

12:36.689 --> 12:41.610
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you like these old retro collections, you definitely want to pick up Treasures 3.

12:41.991 --> 12:42.751
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a good buy for $20.

12:42.951 --> 12:43.871
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't go wrong.

12:44.171 --> 12:46.952
[SPEAKER_02]: So I give it kind of... If you're a retro fan, I recommend it.

12:47.012 --> 12:53.933
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're not so much a retro fan, I can only really give it a borderline recommendation because it's a very focused genre and it kind of gets old.

12:54.594 --> 12:55.454
[SPEAKER_02]: I think if you're not into it.

12:55.834 --> 12:55.934
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

12:56.614 --> 12:58.856
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so those are two games, and then next week I'll talk about Taito.

12:59.456 --> 13:01.038
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get into some gaming news, shall we?

13:01.478 --> 13:01.638
[SPEAKER_02]: Shall we.

13:01.658 --> 13:03.399
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll talk about some news going on.

13:04.620 --> 13:11.525
[SPEAKER_02]: Florida is going to follow the footsteps of California, supposedly, because a violent video game bill has been proposed in Florida now.

13:12.006 --> 13:14.127
[SPEAKER_02]: However, there's a little bit of a difference there.

13:15.188 --> 13:21.213
[SPEAKER_02]: Florida's proposal also includes violent arcade games and shop-selling arcade machines.

13:22.344 --> 13:26.166
[SPEAKER_02]: and not just the retail over-the-counter ones, which I think is very interesting.

13:26.186 --> 13:27.727
[SPEAKER_01]: Eh, that's retarded.

13:28.487 --> 13:28.847
[SPEAKER_02]: How so?

13:29.748 --> 13:34.270
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I can't sell this violent arcade game to a minor.

13:35.451 --> 13:36.151
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that what it's going to be?

13:36.171 --> 13:39.653
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, I guess, but what do you do about little kids walking into an arcade?

13:39.713 --> 13:47.457
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't think the bill is really set to cover that, but, I mean, Mortal Kombat, I saw it, like, you know, 15, and it was awesome.

13:47.497 --> 13:50.539
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not that violent, I mean, I don't know, it's...

13:51.721 --> 13:54.363
[SPEAKER_02]: You remember the big stink they raised about Mortal Kombat, though.

13:54.383 --> 13:59.146
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and they never got it then and didn't get it now, so, I mean, it's just retarded.

13:59.431 --> 14:00.372
[SPEAKER_02]: We just thought we'd let you know.

14:28.358 --> 14:33.862
[SPEAKER_02]: and focus your energies on things like that because that's real violent, that kind of stuff.

14:35.183 --> 14:37.805
[SPEAKER_02]: Video games are cartoons compared to that movie.

14:38.865 --> 14:39.946
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to see that movie.

14:41.627 --> 14:52.935
[SPEAKER_02]: All kidding aside, obviously the issue is movies are rated R and you're warned about it and maybe he feels that video games aren't so well rated, although I seem to recall ratings on the bottom of every video game.

14:55.157 --> 14:55.537
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously,

14:56.958 --> 15:00.334
[SPEAKER_02]: The movies can be way worse, you guys That's my opinion

15:01.908 --> 15:04.770
[SPEAKER_02]: Liberty City Stories, of course, Loki brought that up earlier in the show.

15:05.071 --> 15:10.374
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know that the custom soundtrack option is usually locked out, like you can't really get to it in the game.

15:10.714 --> 15:24.323
[SPEAKER_02]: However, Rockstar Games is now offering for download a Rockstar Custom Tracks program that will allow you to rip tracks off commercial music CDs and put them into your custom soundtracks for Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories.

15:24.864 --> 15:30.227
[SPEAKER_02]: So the interesting thing about this, though, is that it won't recognize stuff you bought off iTunes, which kind of sucks.

15:31.749 --> 15:34.393
[SPEAKER_02]: It will not rip music from CD-Rs.

15:34.894 --> 15:35.334
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it will.

15:36.396 --> 15:40.583
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they say that you can't rip music from CD-Rs.

15:40.703 --> 15:43.828
[SPEAKER_01]: They say that you can't, but you can...

15:44.692 --> 15:54.219
[SPEAKER_01]: What people do is say either, like for example, if you have iTunes, burn a CD and you can either do it that way and burn a CD and then rip it that way.

15:54.800 --> 16:07.289
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if you have other tracks that won't rip for whatever reason, you use your CD burning software to create a disc image and you open that image in a program like Daemon Tools that creates a virtual CD-ROM and you can do it that way.

16:07.850 --> 16:08.190
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

16:09.732 --> 16:11.413
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a long way to go about doing it.

16:11.573 --> 16:17.297
[SPEAKER_01]: And the thing about the custom tracks, though, it's not like its own radio station like in the PC version or something.

16:18.077 --> 16:20.639
[SPEAKER_01]: You actually, it will play like a CD player.

16:20.779 --> 16:23.381
[SPEAKER_01]: So instead of switching stations, you're switching tracks.

16:24.802 --> 16:31.386
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not like you get in a car and you can have your own custom station, which kind of sucks, but I don't know.

16:31.426 --> 16:31.786
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

16:32.489 --> 16:40.054
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, BlizzCon was going on this past weekend, and if you went to BlizzCon, I didn't, because I didn't really get into the Warcraft thing until just a couple weeks ago.

16:40.334 --> 16:42.115
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not in the Warcraft thing, sir.

16:42.535 --> 16:46.558
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, it's not that I hadn't played Diablo 2 and Warcraft 2.

16:46.718 --> 16:48.479
[SPEAKER_02]: I never really did get into StarCraft, though.

16:48.519 --> 16:48.799
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

16:48.839 --> 16:50.761
[SPEAKER_02]: I somehow just completely missed the boat on that one.

16:51.641 --> 16:53.743
[SPEAKER_02]: But as far as Warcraft 2 goes, I just sucked at it.

16:54.683 --> 16:55.263
[SPEAKER_02]: I sucked at it.

16:55.964 --> 16:59.146
[SPEAKER_02]: And Diablo, I played for a little while and then kind of gave up on.

16:59.486 --> 17:02.009
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm just now kind of going back to the Blizzard stuff.

17:03.010 --> 17:05.052
[SPEAKER_02]: But of course, BlizzCon, very well attended.

17:05.112 --> 17:05.793
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of people there.

17:05.853 --> 17:07.194
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of stories from BlizzCon.

17:07.794 --> 17:12.679
[SPEAKER_02]: And they are saying that they are going to be testing a new game.

17:12.759 --> 17:19.846
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you use the, I guess, number on the back of your BlizzCon pass, you can go to a website and sign up to beta test a new game.

17:20.107 --> 17:21.748
[SPEAKER_02]: But they won't say what the game is.

17:22.709 --> 17:24.671
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it a new Diablo game?

17:26.112 --> 17:28.534
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it a WoW expansion or something?

17:28.814 --> 17:32.357
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is it possibly StarCraft Ghost?

17:32.417 --> 17:33.998
[SPEAKER_02]: Although I think that's already on its way.

17:34.399 --> 17:34.979
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know.

17:35.319 --> 17:36.781
[SPEAKER_02]: So we don't know what it's going to be.

17:38.402 --> 17:42.005
[SPEAKER_02]: But I imagine all those Blizzard fanboys and girls will be signing up in droves.

17:44.793 --> 17:52.921
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, also speaking of World of Warcraft, we definitely, definitely have to mention the Burning Crusade, the new expansion that was mentioned this week for World of Warcraft.

17:53.162 --> 17:54.563
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to be upping the level cap to 70.

17:55.484 --> 18:05.195
[SPEAKER_02]: Two brand new playable races, Blood Elves on the Horde side, and although they won't say what it is on the Alliance side, we're hearing buzz that it's Pandarins, but...

18:06.095 --> 18:09.577
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't take that with a grain of salt, but Blood Elves is the for sure one.

18:10.638 --> 18:16.482
[SPEAKER_02]: Some new starting zones, and you can go through the Dark Portal, which is a reference to the Warcraft 2 expansions.

18:17.483 --> 18:22.286
[SPEAKER_02]: New flying mounts, you know, like instead of riding a horse, I guess they fly now.

18:23.206 --> 18:35.815
[SPEAKER_02]: And tons of new quests and tons of new items, and jewel crafting, a new profession, because you're going to have socketed items now, which is kind of something borrowed from Diablo, but if you think about it, World of Warcraft pretty much plays like a Diablo game.

18:36.355 --> 18:37.236
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

18:58.837 --> 19:00.657
[SPEAKER_01]: And that looks damn sexy.

19:00.717 --> 19:06.139
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, a lot of people panned the previous game, Enter the Matrix is what it's called.

19:06.219 --> 19:07.239
[SPEAKER_02]: I liked it.

19:07.399 --> 19:08.639
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't think it was that bad.

19:08.759 --> 19:14.360
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was a really neat idea how they really made it a continuation of the movies.

19:14.740 --> 19:20.562
[SPEAKER_02]: And even if the movies 2 and 3 sucked, it was a neat continuation idea.

19:20.682 --> 19:22.982
[SPEAKER_02]: It really fused the whole movies and games thing.

19:23.022 --> 19:24.302
[SPEAKER_02]: I gotta give them a lot of credit for that.

19:24.542 --> 19:26.463
[SPEAKER_02]: And the game itself was not that bad.

19:27.003 --> 19:28.004
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't bad at all.

19:28.084 --> 19:29.505
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was kind of neat.

19:29.545 --> 19:30.605
[SPEAKER_01]: It was fun.

19:30.765 --> 19:31.205
[SPEAKER_01]: It was tough.

19:32.126 --> 19:35.468
[SPEAKER_01]: This one looks really badass, and the graphics really stepped it up a bit.

19:36.549 --> 19:37.849
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, that's not what I had.

19:39.931 --> 19:49.356
[SPEAKER_01]: The first thing I wanted to mention, actually, there's been a whole lot of, especially with the upcoming systems now, a whole bunch of speculation on dates and stuff.

19:50.797 --> 19:52.658
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that was reported this week is

19:53.300 --> 20:17.798
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's been confirmed by a couple places that the release for the revolution is going to be June 2006 which ties in both it's the end of or I should say the beginning of the new financial year for Nintendo and it's also been confirmed by some other hardware sources people are doing the chip manufacturing and stuff so that'll be interesting but the price point though is kind of up in the air

20:18.206 --> 20:18.687
[SPEAKER_01]: Zeldarevolution

20:32.967 --> 20:36.868
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is not even confirmed to be an actual game that's even in existence.

20:37.088 --> 20:46.311
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if it was in existence, they're not going to release it two months after... Oh my gosh, I'm so embarrassed I can't remember the name of the new Zelda game all of a sudden.

20:47.331 --> 20:48.071
[SPEAKER_01]: You mean Twilight Princess?

20:48.091 --> 20:49.172
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Twilight Princess.

20:49.232 --> 20:49.752
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god.

20:51.092 --> 20:52.813
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I just lost major nerd points there.

20:53.073 --> 20:55.233
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not going to release it two months after Twilight Princess.

20:55.273 --> 20:56.154
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's put it this way, okay?

20:56.534 --> 21:01.095
[SPEAKER_01]: First off, there is no Zelda Revolution, at least not anything that's coming out next year at all.

21:02.047 --> 21:08.770
[SPEAKER_01]: What it's going to be is going to be just Zelda Twilight Princess with Revolution support.

21:08.970 --> 21:13.052
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to have added support added into the game, so if you have Revolution, you can do funky stuff and stuff.

21:13.212 --> 21:15.894
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, like the old Game Boy, Oracle Seasons and stuff.

21:15.994 --> 21:16.894
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, stuff like that.

21:16.934 --> 21:20.316
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, but what you can do is you can...

21:21.559 --> 21:25.642
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually pre-order some stuff with your Revolution in a bundle.

21:25.962 --> 21:30.405
[SPEAKER_01]: Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles, Mario Revolution, Metroid Prime 3, Super Smash Bros.

21:30.465 --> 21:31.205
[SPEAKER_01]: Revolution.

21:32.586 --> 21:33.927
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can reserve those for $240.

21:34.047 --> 21:40.612
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is interesting seeing as none of those games are even confirmed to exist.

21:40.672 --> 21:41.672
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, that's kind of weird.

21:41.692 --> 21:48.457
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like saying, I want to pre-order Grand Theft Auto V. But...

21:49.666 --> 21:53.829
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing which was very interesting is the PlayStation 3.

21:54.449 --> 21:58.352
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's been a lot of, you know, when's this thing coming out too?

21:59.213 --> 22:02.935
[SPEAKER_01]: And now there's a rumor going around that's saying that it's not going to be until 2007.

22:02.995 --> 22:05.737
[SPEAKER_01]: No, they wouldn't.

22:05.797 --> 22:07.738
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be crazy.

22:08.059 --> 22:17.545
[SPEAKER_01]: 2007 due to hardware failures because apparently the system, you know, a la normal PlayStation 2 and PlayStation, they get a little hot.

22:19.056 --> 22:19.576
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

22:21.017 --> 22:23.557
[SPEAKER_02]: That would really stink if they pushed that back to 2007.

22:23.817 --> 22:24.738
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be, oh.

22:25.058 --> 22:30.599
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but of course this is, you know, a friend of, you know, I heard it from somebody who heard it from somebody.

22:30.619 --> 22:31.800
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's crap then.

22:31.880 --> 22:36.581
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, very interesting stuff though.

22:37.413 --> 22:37.673
[SPEAKER_02]: XBOX 360 System

23:04.035 --> 23:04.997
[SPEAKER_01]: Not the core system.

23:05.537 --> 23:07.900
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they didn't really make that many to begin with.

23:08.000 --> 23:10.964
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't think that they're... It's all based on pre-orders.

23:11.144 --> 23:16.150
[SPEAKER_01]: So these stores, you know, if they ordered that many core systems to come in, then that's what they're getting.

23:16.190 --> 23:18.794
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not going to be like, we wanted to bring in some systems.

23:19.354 --> 23:20.836
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's some core systems instead.

23:20.856 --> 23:22.198
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, you know, that'd be like...

23:23.342 --> 23:28.245
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd be like going to your store, you know, and, oh, I'm going to be selling a bunch of Pentium 4 PCs.

23:28.485 --> 23:31.726
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, sorry, we sent you Pentium 3 PCs, you know, deal.

23:32.227 --> 23:33.987
[SPEAKER_01]: So, it's not going to happen.

23:34.007 --> 23:42.292
[SPEAKER_02]: You know how I feel about pre-ordering, and I have this really hard idea believing that they would put off major retailers like Toys R Us and Best Buy by shafting them with just the $300.

23:42.852 --> 23:45.773
[SPEAKER_01]: Best Buy is only getting about $50 per store.

23:46.334 --> 23:46.854
[SPEAKER_01]: That is it.

23:47.074 --> 23:50.496
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you're going to have some major trouble finding one launch day.

23:50.516 --> 23:50.676
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

23:51.978 --> 23:59.323
[SPEAKER_01]: I really am saying it's going to be short handed and as it is, eBay, they're already up to $480 to $600 for guaranteed getting them on launch day pre-books.

24:06.129 --> 24:06.569
[SPEAKER_02]: Crazy.

24:06.949 --> 24:07.309
[SPEAKER_02]: Crazy.

24:08.590 --> 24:10.091
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to be pissed if that happens.

24:10.651 --> 24:11.051
[SPEAKER_02]: Watch me.

24:11.131 --> 24:12.231
[SPEAKER_02]: I will rant on this program.

24:13.012 --> 24:13.272
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway.

24:15.252 --> 24:15.953
[SPEAKER_01]: I better get mine.

24:16.393 --> 24:17.693
[SPEAKER_01]: It's paid for completely.

24:18.053 --> 24:19.054
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

24:20.614 --> 24:20.955
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on.

24:20.995 --> 24:24.536
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go to the mailbox because I went ahead and opened up the mailbox this week.

24:24.576 --> 24:33.959
[SPEAKER_02]: I know this is usually DarkSakura's task, but she gave me permission to open up the mailbox this week, read some emails sent at togo at orangelaunchradio.com is our mailbox.

24:34.440 --> 24:35.320
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's open up the mailbag.

24:37.074 --> 24:37.815
[SPEAKER_02]: and see what's going on.

24:40.138 --> 24:43.361
[SPEAKER_02]: We have an email from Dallas who actually lives in Salt Lake City.

24:44.483 --> 24:54.751
[SPEAKER_02]: Dallas wrote us to tell us that they were listening to the last podcast and we mentioned about the congressional bill about how all TVs must be digital or TV stations need to be broadcast only in digital by 2008.

24:56.693 --> 24:59.735
[SPEAKER_02]: Digital is not the same as HD is what Dallas wants to clarify.

25:00.035 --> 25:04.099
[SPEAKER_02]: So all TVs by 2008 need to be able to receive a digital signal.

25:04.419 --> 25:08.062
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't mean that TVs need to receive an HD signal which is completely different.

25:08.622 --> 25:12.484
[SPEAKER_02]: and basically any TV can receive a digital signal with a converter from RadioShack.

25:12.824 --> 25:15.745
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you already get digital cable or satellite, then you're already set.

25:16.086 --> 25:21.768
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, all current game consoles are digital, so all next-gen consoles will be digital as well.

25:22.348 --> 25:25.690
[SPEAKER_02]: But it seems only the 360 and PS3 will have HD capabilities.

25:26.230 --> 25:27.731
[SPEAKER_02]: HD is a completely different monster.

25:28.111 --> 25:33.153
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to have this misperception with digital and HD was the same thing, and I think many people have the same misperception.

25:33.473 --> 25:34.794
[SPEAKER_02]: Hope that clarifies things.

25:35.393 --> 25:37.253
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought they were broadcasting in HD.

25:37.293 --> 25:38.694
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought everything was going in HD.

25:39.254 --> 25:41.174
[SPEAKER_02]: I was under that misimpression too.

25:41.554 --> 25:44.975
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't so much that I misunderstood that there was a difference between digital and HD.

25:45.455 --> 25:48.476
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought that the bill was telling them they'd have to do HD.

25:48.596 --> 25:51.796
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it was supposed to be HD because everything is going into that format now.

25:52.057 --> 25:53.317
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be all widescreen.

25:53.357 --> 25:54.697
[SPEAKER_01]: It's what everything is going into.

25:55.377 --> 25:58.718
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why newer TVs can't support that.

25:58.758 --> 26:03.439
[SPEAKER_01]: But hey, more power to you if it's just digital.

26:04.147 --> 26:04.688
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura.com

26:25.511 --> 26:26.012
[SPEAKER_02]: Good luck with that.

26:26.332 --> 26:27.453
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's go to another email.

26:27.473 --> 26:30.496
[SPEAKER_02]: This is from one of our serial emailers, Rob.

26:31.156 --> 26:31.697
[SPEAKER_02]: But we like him.

26:31.717 --> 26:32.838
[SPEAKER_02]: He always has a lot of good stuff to say.

26:32.878 --> 26:37.041
[SPEAKER_02]: He wants to give us a useless bit of trivia for the game Grip Shift.

26:37.442 --> 26:41.966
[SPEAKER_02]: There's actually an Easter egg if you watch the credits of Grip Shift all the way through.

26:42.726 --> 26:44.348
[SPEAKER_02]: You get a recipe at the end.

26:45.048 --> 26:45.829
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of cool.

26:46.710 --> 26:47.590
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the recipe for?

26:48.231 --> 26:50.353
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't say in the email, but I think it's on our forums.

26:50.553 --> 26:51.694
[SPEAKER_02]: So go check out the forums.

26:53.546 --> 26:53.867
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

26:54.507 --> 26:56.489
[SPEAKER_02]: And last up, we got an email from Polly.

26:56.509 --> 27:00.132
[SPEAKER_02]: And this actually relates to something that's going on in the news right now.

27:00.732 --> 27:09.219
[SPEAKER_02]: The Ultramix 3 and Xtreme 2 and Karaoke Revolution Tour, the DDR and Karaoke Revolution Tour that's going on in some of the malls.

27:10.500 --> 27:15.925
[SPEAKER_02]: Polly wrote us because he wants to say that he actually went and wants to describe the setup a little bit.

27:16.205 --> 27:20.048
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a small stage set up with DDR Xtreme 2 set up southwest of the stage.

27:20.376 --> 27:22.759
[SPEAKER_02]: and Ultramix 3 set up Southeast.

27:23.279 --> 27:26.322
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, they didn't have metal pads, just the official sticky pads.

27:26.763 --> 27:29.065
[SPEAKER_02]: EX2 and Ultramix 3 have a bunch of new songs.

27:29.425 --> 27:37.314
[SPEAKER_02]: Although Extreme 2 seems to stick to the DDR feel and Ultramix 3 seems to have a bigger variety to me, both seem like good games to get for DDR Bomani fans.

27:37.674 --> 27:41.438
[SPEAKER_02]: The stage itself had a single soft pad and kiosk for Karaoke Revolution.

27:41.638 --> 27:42.058
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

28:11.198 --> 28:12.199
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm, very interesting.

28:12.819 --> 28:26.205
[SPEAKER_02]: Also says at the end here, but for the lucky people in Illinois, Massachusetts, and New Jersey areas where this tour is going next, I say go to this event for some free DDR stuff, a chance to win $5,000, and to help those no-energy workers promote buhani games.

28:27.406 --> 28:28.967
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds like fun, so check that out.

28:29.007 --> 28:38.011
[SPEAKER_02]: If you happen to live in Massachusetts, Illinois, or New Jersey, the tour is on its way to you, so go check it out if you're into the music games, which we are here at Orange Love Radio.

28:39.909 --> 28:41.309
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to do it for the mailbox tonight.

28:41.870 --> 28:46.751
[SPEAKER_02]: 2go at orangeloungeradio.com is the email address if you ever want to send us any feedback, comments, or questions on the show.

28:47.211 --> 28:50.833
[SPEAKER_01]: Also check out the olrpsp.com site.

28:51.173 --> 28:56.174
[SPEAKER_01]: We just added a brand new way to communicate with us via the shout line.

28:56.194 --> 28:56.794
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out!

28:57.055 --> 29:02.896
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a shout line and a wonderful shout box that I worked so very hard on.

29:03.417 --> 29:04.397
[SPEAKER_01]: It's there for fun.

29:04.937 --> 29:07.778
[SPEAKER_01]: Post your thoughts, your feelings, or just play with it.

29:08.479 --> 29:08.859
[SPEAKER_02]: Have fun.

29:08.879 --> 29:10.440
[SPEAKER_02]: But don't spam it or we'll kill you.

29:10.921 --> 29:11.301
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all right.

29:11.341 --> 29:12.682
[SPEAKER_01]: We can ban you.

29:13.022 --> 29:13.582
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll ban you.

29:13.602 --> 29:14.603
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll ban you.

29:14.703 --> 29:16.704
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like we're the moderators of Ragnarok Online.

29:16.824 --> 29:17.405
[SPEAKER_02]: We ban you.

29:18.786 --> 29:21.307
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, check that out.

29:21.387 --> 29:25.010
[SPEAKER_02]: And olrpsp.com, again, is really meant for your PSP.

29:25.330 --> 29:29.653
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you can bring it up in Internet Explorer or Firefox, but it's just not as cool.

29:30.273 --> 29:30.634
[SPEAKER_02]: Trust me.

29:30.754 --> 29:31.674
[SPEAKER_02]: Bring it up on your PSP.

29:31.734 --> 29:32.675
[SPEAKER_02]: It's awesome looking.

29:34.249 --> 29:34.750
[SPEAKER_02]: It Got Cancelled!

29:52.011 --> 29:56.155
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole damn thing got canceled, except for, well, they do, you know, a couple shows.

29:56.495 --> 30:10.128
[SPEAKER_02]: They ended up doing the shows in, I think, Spokane and Vancouver, but they canceled all the rest, or at least, you know, they say, well, they kind of may be postponing them to 2006, but long story short, you got to go back, get your tickets refunded, and guess what?

30:10.368 --> 30:13.351
[SPEAKER_02]: That Ticketmaster handling fee, non-refundable.

30:14.312 --> 30:15.233
[SPEAKER_02]: You got screwed out of 450.

30:18.704 --> 30:32.139
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is really weird, though, because I seem to remember that they made this big hubbaloo about postponing the dates, and I bet if we went in the older podcasts, we'd find where we were talking about this, even, where they were adding more dates because of demand.

30:32.600 --> 30:34.842
[SPEAKER_02]: And now they're saying they're canceling them because...

30:35.763 --> 30:40.485
[SPEAKER_02]: They thought more people would be supportive of the concept and there just wasn't enough interest generated in these shows.

30:40.686 --> 30:43.727
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they really underestimated how much people hate Tommy Tarling.

30:44.607 --> 30:45.368
[SPEAKER_02]: You're mean.

30:49.650 --> 30:55.393
[SPEAKER_02]: I was turned off by the fact they said they were going to play music from Pong and Donkey Kong and I'm sitting here going, what?

30:56.093 --> 30:57.734
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no music in Pong?

30:58.094 --> 31:00.475
[SPEAKER_02]: It was supposed to be inspired by Pong.

31:00.796 --> 31:01.396
[SPEAKER_02]: That's crap.

31:03.156 --> 31:03.536
[SPEAKER_02]: Boop!

31:03.637 --> 31:06.618
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a bunch of... Maybe I'm just reading rumors or something.

31:06.638 --> 31:08.860
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to get quoted or nasty emails and stuff.

31:08.880 --> 31:13.683
[SPEAKER_02]: But seriously, they were talking about playing music from these old, old, old 80s games that had no music.

31:13.723 --> 31:15.904
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that Donkey Kong or something was on there.

31:16.244 --> 31:17.085
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm just thinking, what?

31:17.985 --> 31:24.009
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the other stuff might have been cool, like Metal Gear Solid and stuff, but I bet Squeenix is pointing and laughing going, uh-huh.

31:25.009 --> 31:26.550
[SPEAKER_02]: Dear Friends was a big success.

31:26.791 --> 31:27.131
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh-huh.

31:28.231 --> 31:30.473
[SPEAKER_02]: More Friends plagued with sound problems and

31:31.411 --> 31:37.696
[SPEAKER_02]: Got panned by the video game community because we didn't know how to put on a show at the Hollywood Amphitheater or wherever the hell that thing was we went to.

31:38.137 --> 31:41.660
[SPEAKER_02]: Universal thing, but at least that place was sold out.

31:44.802 --> 31:46.483
[SPEAKER_01]: With their exploding soundboard.

31:46.844 --> 31:54.630
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you know, it was so cool because they'd have like the one-winged angel and out come the black mages, you know.

31:54.670 --> 31:59.134
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, like this random wood thing falling.

31:59.734 --> 32:00.335
[SPEAKER_02]: That was awful.

32:01.089 --> 32:03.351
[SPEAKER_01]: I have full faith in him now.

32:03.371 --> 32:03.831
[SPEAKER_02]: Jason X was awesome.

32:28.755 --> 32:33.677
[SPEAKER_01]: No granted though, if anyone's going to pull off a Jason in Space movie, it would be him, I guess.

32:35.058 --> 32:39.619
[SPEAKER_02]: Uwe Boll is going to split the Dungeon Siege movie, Kill Bill style.

32:40.860 --> 32:41.520
[SPEAKER_02]: Very interesting.

32:41.720 --> 32:45.242
[SPEAKER_02]: This movie's going to be like four hours long, so they're splitting it into two parts.

32:45.422 --> 32:48.263
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to know how long originally this movie's supposed to be?

32:49.183 --> 32:53.745
[SPEAKER_01]: He said that it was basically the original script...

32:54.227 --> 32:59.150
[SPEAKER_01]: And the script that he apparently is going by right now is 485 pages long.

32:59.290 --> 33:02.572
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um... Excuse me, hold on.

33:02.592 --> 33:03.513
[SPEAKER_01]: Lord of the Rings ripoff!

33:04.793 --> 33:06.514
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, 485 pages long.

33:06.975 --> 33:09.756
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know in script writing, each page is supposed to be about a minute.

33:09.776 --> 33:11.678
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be an 8 hour long movie.

33:12.198 --> 33:12.878
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god.

33:13.599 --> 33:13.799
[SPEAKER_01]: So...

33:14.904 --> 33:20.709
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess the first part is going to be called In the Name of the King, and it will be out November 3rd, 2006.

33:21.769 --> 33:23.951
[SPEAKER_02]: But then the conclusion will be out December 1st, 2006.

33:24.091 --> 33:27.494
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's going to be like one month in between.

33:27.954 --> 33:33.298
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm willing to give it a chance, but I'm kind of like, is this only getting made because of Lord of the Rings?

33:33.719 --> 33:36.200
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it going to be a subpar clone?

33:36.240 --> 33:37.421
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it BloodRayne?

33:37.642 --> 33:40.384
[SPEAKER_01]: The reviews for it have been horrible.

33:40.764 --> 33:41.124
[SPEAKER_01]: Horrible.

33:41.164 --> 33:41.805
[SPEAKER_01]: Horrible.

33:43.117 --> 33:45.318
[SPEAKER_02]: StarShipTroopers is being turned into a PC game.

34:05.945 --> 34:17.409
[SPEAKER_02]: So, in 2000, I guess in 2000 they had a first Starship Troopers-based game, but this is a new one that is basically doing a first-person perspective type thing.

34:19.510 --> 34:19.890
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

34:20.250 --> 34:24.212
[SPEAKER_02]: Casper Van Diem, by the way, who was in the film, will be doing voiceover commentary in the game.

34:24.332 --> 34:25.252
[SPEAKER_02]: Because he doesn't get any work.

34:25.512 --> 34:25.893
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

34:27.933 --> 34:29.074
[SPEAKER_02]: Any other news for us, Loki?

34:29.974 --> 34:30.954
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, let me see.

34:31.014 --> 34:33.876
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I know, of course, there's stuff.

34:34.376 --> 34:35.076
[SPEAKER_01]: The first being...

34:37.426 --> 34:38.686
[SPEAKER_01]: Stuff for the PSP, of course.

34:39.306 --> 34:48.428
[SPEAKER_01]: The big thing that everybody's been, you know, up in arms about is the brand new, actually, well, for example, SOCOM.

34:48.548 --> 35:05.531
[SPEAKER_01]: They have voice chat in it, so now they are going to be offering, pretty soon, a headset for chatting on, you know, via the game over, you know, the internet, just like you would with anybody else playing, you know, SOCOM on your PS2 or whatnot.

35:06.286 --> 35:08.888
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's going to be coming out pretty soon, which is kind of cool.

35:10.569 --> 35:19.516
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing was, they were talking about a little bit on the Resident Evil DS stuff, which looks really weird.

35:21.278 --> 35:28.804
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm always kind of concerned with the quirky gameplay of the DS with Resident Evil.

35:28.824 --> 35:29.144
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

35:30.476 --> 35:31.297
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just not seeing it.

35:31.917 --> 35:34.219
[SPEAKER_02]: Resident Evil Deadly Silence.

35:34.959 --> 35:36.500
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn you people and your DS.

35:38.462 --> 35:45.626
[SPEAKER_02]: God, every freaking franchise that's gone over to DS had to be like, you know, Drill Spirits or Dawn of Sorrow.

35:45.646 --> 35:47.448
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, God, we get it.

35:47.608 --> 35:48.568
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a DS game.

35:51.250 --> 35:55.713
[SPEAKER_02]: It's coming out, by the way, in mid-January in Japan, but I'm sure we'll get it here.

35:56.314 --> 35:56.694
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.

35:58.100 --> 35:59.781
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't wanna end up in a Jill's sandwich.

36:16.906 --> 36:19.867
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that'd be so bad.

36:20.527 --> 36:35.974
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, really, the other big thing that was coming out, actually, is the add-on for Half-Life 2, Lost Coast, and it's actually available now via Steam, which is definitely the way you can download it.

36:35.994 --> 36:42.016
[SPEAKER_01]: It supposedly has some graphical updates to it, new volumetric lighting, and just the

36:42.685 --> 36:46.727
[SPEAKER_01]: Overall, Half-Life 2 is sexy, so that's all you really need to know.

36:46.787 --> 36:53.910
[SPEAKER_01]: The other big thing, actually, if games are coming out, would be THQ's lineup for the 360.

36:54.771 --> 37:01.834
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody's looking forward to Saints Row, which is supposed to be one of the Grand Theft Auto games now for the 360.

37:02.383 --> 37:03.864
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, another one.

37:04.164 --> 37:04.944
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?

37:23.041 --> 37:26.504
[SPEAKER_02]: Why am I getting so upset about not being able to get an Xbox 360 on launch day?

37:26.524 --> 37:28.366
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there's going to be no freaking games out.

37:28.546 --> 37:30.408
[SPEAKER_02]: All your launch titles are coming out in November.

37:31.329 --> 37:34.191
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to be seeing anything new until January.

37:34.252 --> 37:37.555
[SPEAKER_01]: And so far, everything that's been announced for January, The Godfather...

37:38.294 --> 37:47.521
[SPEAKER_01]: which is one of the games that's coming out, and I believe there was another game that was pushed back to that date, NBA, or College Hoops, 2006.

37:47.561 --> 37:53.286
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't the Elder Scrolls one get... Elder Scrolls is in December, the first week in December.

37:53.306 --> 37:54.527
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so we do get a December game.

37:54.687 --> 38:01.713
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's going to be awesome, but, you know, it's really sad that this is everything that's coming out.

38:01.733 --> 38:04.655
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be, you know, DSPSP syndrome, you know, where

38:05.148 --> 38:08.589
[SPEAKER_01]: The system launches with a ton of titles and you're like, okay, wow, all those games are cool.

38:08.949 --> 38:09.769
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you got for me next?

38:10.609 --> 38:11.190
[SPEAKER_01]: We got nothing.

38:12.250 --> 38:15.791
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe now I'm starting to reconsider if I really need to buy into this hype on the launch.

38:15.811 --> 38:16.831
[SPEAKER_01]: It's only by second wave.

38:16.891 --> 38:19.612
[SPEAKER_01]: It's coming out first, second week in January.

38:20.932 --> 38:22.192
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when you can get your 360.

38:23.273 --> 38:23.833
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll think about it.

38:24.033 --> 38:24.453
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll think about it.

38:25.544 --> 38:26.824
[SPEAKER_02]: News on Final Fantasy 3DS

38:48.570 --> 38:54.155
[SPEAKER_02]: Final Fantasy 3 used some complicated programming techniques that really couldn't be ported to a handheld gaming machine until now.

38:55.216 --> 39:00.420
[SPEAKER_02]: So what they did is, since it went so long without an upgrade, they decided to do some graphical upgrades for Final Fantasy 3.

39:01.080 --> 39:05.144
[SPEAKER_02]: Not to be confused, you guys, with the American Final Fantasy 3, which was actually Final Fantasy 6.

39:06.165 --> 39:10.168
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to remake the Japanese Final Fantasy 3 and call it Final Fantasy 3 on the DS.

39:10.488 --> 39:13.251
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to have sort of 3D graphics.

39:13.971 --> 39:20.936
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be virtual 3D graphics, so you can't really rotate the maps on demand or anything, but you can still zoom in and out and stuff.

39:21.216 --> 39:26.620
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're going to redo the characters and some of the technology, and they will incorporate a little bit of touchscreen into it.

39:27.000 --> 39:30.103
[SPEAKER_02]: Think 3D as in Final Fantasy VII.

39:31.546 --> 39:36.490
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, in the original Nintendo one, the four main characters really didn't have any personalities.

39:36.850 --> 39:41.974
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the DS remake, they are going to get some new personalities that are going to impact the storyline.

39:42.255 --> 39:45.357
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's basically going to be this whole new game, it sounds like.

39:46.058 --> 39:47.919
[SPEAKER_02]: So, it should be fun.

39:48.279 --> 39:48.560
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

39:49.360 --> 39:50.261
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm definitely going to pick that up.

39:50.721 --> 39:52.783
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, I've got to say this one more.

39:53.504 --> 39:55.966
[SPEAKER_02]: There will be wireless capability.

39:58.933 --> 40:03.197
[SPEAKER_02]: They won't say how, but it's going to use the wireless capability for some sort of bonus.

40:04.438 --> 40:04.858
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

40:05.098 --> 40:05.338
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.

40:06.079 --> 40:08.041
[SPEAKER_02]: Couple last news stories for you guys tonight.

40:08.561 --> 40:09.862
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless you have anything else, Loki?

40:09.902 --> 40:11.323
[SPEAKER_02]: I have stuff, of course.

40:12.004 --> 40:15.047
[SPEAKER_02]: Then finish up, because all I've got left is the funny stuff.

40:15.207 --> 40:15.847
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, okay.

40:15.907 --> 40:18.509
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the first thing I've got, and this is kind of cool.

40:19.731 --> 40:23.614
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a fan of playing the old arcade games and you...

40:24.226 --> 40:25.247
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

40:48.176 --> 40:50.097
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's pretty interesting.

40:50.858 --> 40:52.059
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what, kids?

40:52.199 --> 40:54.642
[SPEAKER_02]: Just spend $40 on Arcade Treasures 1 and 2.

40:55.282 --> 40:56.583
[SPEAKER_02]: Or spend $60 and get 1, 2, and 3.

40:57.004 --> 41:04.791
[SPEAKER_02]: And just tilt your TV a little bit and maybe spend another $20 on an arcade-style joystick and you're set.

41:06.212 --> 41:13.519
[SPEAKER_01]: And in news that I like to classify as no shit, the Zelda 3 game that was available on eBay, yeah, that was fake.

41:15.099 --> 41:18.544
[SPEAKER_01]: Not the real Zelda 3 game.

41:19.185 --> 41:21.869
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, that's kind of interesting.

41:21.889 --> 41:22.911
[SPEAKER_01]: And then finally...

41:23.854 --> 41:29.458
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why, but Pac-Man in Pac-Man World 3 is giving his own voice.

41:30.559 --> 41:31.499
[SPEAKER_01]: Who will be voicing him?

41:31.699 --> 41:45.128
[SPEAKER_01]: But Martin T. Sherman, who had voiced such games as Driver 3, Second Sight, and TimeSplitters Future Perfect, which, by the way, is a very underrated game.

41:45.709 --> 41:51.172
[SPEAKER_01]: But really awesome, and personally, I think Pac-Man World 3 is going to suck.

41:51.212 --> 41:51.573
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyways...

41:52.974 --> 41:54.274
[SPEAKER_02]: Why did you say it was really awesome?

41:55.355 --> 41:55.815
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

41:56.135 --> 41:58.057
[SPEAKER_02]: You were still thinking about TimeSplitters.

41:58.297 --> 41:58.857
[SPEAKER_01]: I was still thinking.

41:59.277 --> 41:59.858
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

42:00.918 --> 42:01.198
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

42:01.819 --> 42:05.661
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a couple WTF stories for you guys.

42:06.322 --> 42:07.502
[SPEAKER_02]: Tamagotchi DS.

42:08.163 --> 42:10.084
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we reported on this a few months ago.

42:10.124 --> 42:13.466
[SPEAKER_02]: We talked about Tamagotchi Corner Store, which was coming out in Japan.

42:14.006 --> 42:14.547
[SPEAKER_02]: Guess what?

42:15.807 --> 42:17.048
[SPEAKER_02]: It's coming out in the US.

42:17.768 --> 42:19.329
[SPEAKER_02]: They are going to bring this game out in the US.

42:19.389 --> 42:20.310
[SPEAKER_02]: Guess when it's coming out?

42:21.171 --> 42:21.731
[SPEAKER_02]: This fall.

42:22.611 --> 42:25.113
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, soon, very soon.

42:25.293 --> 42:28.135
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess secretly this whole time they're reporting it to the U.S.

42:28.195 --> 42:39.342
[SPEAKER_02]: So it is coming out here, and they're saying that the original Tamagotchi struck a chord with kids who wanted a toy that complemented their active lifestyle, and these virtual pets were the perfect answer.

42:39.883 --> 42:46.427
[SPEAKER_02]: Tamagotchi provides the nurturing play pattern with the electronic component and portability that allows kids to take the toy with them wherever they go.

42:46.927 --> 42:50.730
[SPEAKER_02]: This coming from Rain Rice of the Toy Industry Association.

42:52.628 --> 43:00.712
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, what I do think is kind of cool about this is that it is actually being designed by Nana Onsha, who made Parappa the Rapper.

43:01.153 --> 43:14.240
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I'm not completely laughing at this game just yet, because it's Tamagotchi related, because, you know, Parappa changed, you know, Parappa provided, you could say we would not have music games today if it weren't for Parappa.

43:15.083 --> 43:15.183
[SPEAKER_02]: Halo 2

43:41.832 --> 43:44.413
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to be getting better graphics when they're hitting the 360.

43:44.453 --> 43:48.015
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to be getting graphic enhancements and whatnot.

43:48.695 --> 43:50.756
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of something to look forward to.

43:50.776 --> 44:03.522
[SPEAKER_01]: They're actually redoing the graphics or enhancing them like they should have been with the PlayStation 2, which was a little bit better graphics on the PlayStation 2 when you're playing PlayStation 1 games.

44:05.754 --> 44:07.475
[SPEAKER_02]: So, that is how they're going to do it?

44:07.495 --> 44:09.777
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to release so many games a week for backwards compatibility?

44:09.797 --> 44:14.361
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, basically, here's... I still have yet to really hear a clear, definitive answer.

44:15.001 --> 44:26.850
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be... Well, what I heard was it's about 20... The numbers they were throwing out, about 15 to 25 of the top titles right now are going to be starting the first week.

44:26.930 --> 44:29.893
[SPEAKER_01]: Each week, there's going to be more titles added to the list of compatibility.

44:31.174 --> 44:33.676
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to have a system with a hard drive and...

44:34.358 --> 44:37.041
[SPEAKER_01]: and you have to have an Xbox Live account, I think.

44:37.521 --> 44:38.042
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.

44:38.362 --> 44:45.469
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure if it's a live gold account, because that would be really cheap of them, but I wouldn't put it past them.

44:47.871 --> 44:49.072
[SPEAKER_02]: My last story I have tonight.

44:50.594 --> 44:59.102
[SPEAKER_02]: Gamasutra ran a story earlier this week that talks about several executives of the company that is producing and distributing the Gizmondo

45:00.259 --> 45:04.321
[SPEAKER_02]: Supposedly they are connected to organized crime, the mob.

45:04.701 --> 45:05.341
[SPEAKER_02]: Swedish mob.

45:05.361 --> 45:07.402
[SPEAKER_02]: So the mob made your Gizmondo.

45:07.422 --> 45:11.804
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, they're connected to the Swedish mob, supposedly, and all this stuff.

45:12.985 --> 45:19.948
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, you know, they use the word alleged and all that stuff, but wouldn't that be interesting that the Gizmondo was actually funded by the mob?

45:19.988 --> 45:24.570
[SPEAKER_02]: Doesn't save it from being kind of crappy, which is what all the reviews are saying, is that the game is crappy, crappy, crappy.

45:25.070 --> 45:27.292
[SPEAKER_02]: Not the game, the system, and all its games are crappy crappy.

45:27.892 --> 45:36.638
[SPEAKER_02]: I have yet to put my hands on it, so I won't withhold final judgment, but rumor is this is going to go down in history somewhere next to the end gauge.

45:37.158 --> 45:37.438
[SPEAKER_02]: Sad.

45:38.139 --> 45:38.619
[SPEAKER_01]: Finally.

45:39.660 --> 45:40.880
[SPEAKER_02]: You already had your final shot.

45:41.341 --> 45:41.701
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, fine.

45:41.761 --> 45:41.981
[SPEAKER_02]: One more.

45:42.001 --> 45:42.381
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you want?

45:42.782 --> 45:50.887
[SPEAKER_01]: This is kind of old news, because when people are downloading this, this won't apply to them anymore, but this weekend was the Nintendogs kind of

45:51.505 --> 45:52.386
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad my dogs are dead.

46:18.580 --> 46:25.024
[SPEAKER_01]: and Nintendo and GameStop are donating $50,000 to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.

46:25.284 --> 46:32.908
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if all I get out of it is a crappy message from Haley Duff, then I'm glad I let my dog starve for the past three weeks because I haven't played that game at all.

46:33.869 --> 46:36.650
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't fed my dog at all, so I'm done with that game.

46:37.891 --> 46:38.932
[SPEAKER_02]: Good thing it's not real.

46:39.572 --> 46:40.813
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, final thoughts.

46:40.993 --> 46:42.033
[SPEAKER_02]: We're about done with the show.

46:42.093 --> 46:42.914
[SPEAKER_02]: Final thoughts, Loki.

46:44.184 --> 46:47.867
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to play Shadow Colossus this week for sure.

46:48.027 --> 46:48.367
[SPEAKER_02]: Me too.

46:48.488 --> 46:52.832
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, I'm going to be playing more, more, more Warriors.

46:54.073 --> 46:57.056
[SPEAKER_02]: My final thought is I need to not feed my dogs.

46:57.116 --> 46:59.258
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to feed myself right now because I'm very hungry.
