Once again, welcome aboard for the Orange Lounge Radio-to-Go edition.

but her name is DarkSakura.

9
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:07,480
Yeah, that would be me. That is you. That would be me

10
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:10,760
if I were me today. Who are you today then?

11
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:14,240
My name is Zool.

12
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,560
Are you the keymaster? Oh god.

13
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:21,400
Alright, that was bad. Alright. That was the ferret.

14
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,800
Also with us, Techmaster Loki. I am here and I'm me.

15
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:30,520
So yeah, you're not I don't believe you. You're not the gatekeeper or whatever. No, okay

16
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:33,200
That's good. Cuz then you guys would have to have sex or something. They'll be nasty

17
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,920
I'm married. Thank you. I know you are

18
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,360
anyway

19
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,440
We're here to talk about games, right? So let's do it

20
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:45,280
let's get into how is your gaming week and then we'll get into the news and what's going on around the

21
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:50,280
Gaming world the hack and crack. I think we have a mod story tonight UK news everything

22
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,120
Let's start off, though, with our gaming week, because, you know, part of this show is about

23
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,120
us, right?

24
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,120
So, Dark Sakura.

25
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,120
It's all about me, you know.

26
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,120
Yeah, I know.

27
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,660
I'm the diva of the show.

28
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:01,480
How was your gaming week, Dark Sakura?

29
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:05,240
Actually, I was so busy all week, I haven't had much of a chance to play things, although

30
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,920
I have put in effort.

31
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:10,560
I got a Dalmatian on that dog game.

32
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,560
Nintendogs?

33
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,560
Yeah.

34
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,560
How quickly do we forget?

35
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,860
After forgetting to feed my dogs for, like, two days, I have a new dog that lives with

36
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:22,740
my corgi ein and my shiba inu menshi.

37
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:25,940
It's a dalmatian because my friend loaned me a hat so I could get a dalmatian in my

38
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:27,940
kennel and give the hat back.

39
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:30,620
My dog's name is Ikea.

40
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:31,620
We were going to name it Alpo.

41
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,220
Yes, I suggested Alpo.

42
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:39,900
Alpo didn't work and I didn't want to pick something as crude as naming my dog Smallpox,

43
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:45,460
so I named it Ikea because it made me think of meatballs.

44
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:51,620
also got me that lawyer game. Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney. Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney.

45
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:55,380
I think it's ironic that there's like a lawyer game and a doctor game out like right around

46
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:59,160
the same time. Doctor game's getting a secret too. Trauma Center. Oh my gosh. I've heard

47
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:02,020
Trauma Center is really difficult. I haven't gotten a chance to play it, but I hear Trauma

48
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:06,040
Center is really, really difficult. You know, unfortunately that brings me back to the game

49
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:10,380
of Life and Death. Remember that game back on the PC way a long time ago? I think about

50
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:14,900
operation but sorry dark soccer wouldn't operation just be an operation the MMO

51
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:21,380
no you know too many doctors ruin the operation um but yeah I was gonna play

52
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:25,160
it and then Dan started to play it used to play the Castlevania that but so he

53
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:30,020
needs to let me play the attorney game I need to solve cases I'm good at that

54
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:34,940
kind of thing um I also tried to play some Katamari but that's too busy and

55
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:38,860
then I screamed obscenities at illustrator this morning good good times

56
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:42,340
Maybe you could check out an Illustrator podcast to help you out there.

57
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:45,020
I'm sure there's got to be one out there somewhere.

58
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:47,020
We hate Adobe Hour!

59
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:49,980
Alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?

60
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:55,100
Actually, I have to say, because we're not talking about it immediately, we did have

61
00:03:55,100 --> 00:04:00,060
a very cool gaming event on Thursday that we'll go into later.

62
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,420
Yes, we will get into this later, definitely.

63
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:05,960
And also, speaking of events, the Sacramento Independent Audio for Katrina Relief, thank

64
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:09,960
Thank you to everybody that helped out with that, sending your donations in online.

65
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:13,320
We had the garage sale the other night, and we're doing a lot of good for a lot of people.

66
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:16,160
I have a trunk full of stuff to donate to the Salvation Army now, too.

67
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,160
The leftovers.

68
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,760
Including some games, some DS games and stuff were in there, right?

69
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:25,220
I actually, with the games, I can get more out of them by selling them to places that

70
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:31,880
give cash for games, and then turn over the proceeds with our donations.

71
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:36,720
I actually donated my own copies of Polaris and Field Magic, which I'm done with both

72
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,720
of those games very much.

73
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:41,480
Yeah, because I remember how much you love Polaris and Polaris.

74
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,480
You know what?

75
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,980
There's worse DS games out there, though.

76
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:47,600
Check out my review of Sprung last week, if you want to hear a bad DS game.

77
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,600
I still need Electroplankton.

78
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,600
That's what I'm waiting for.

79
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,600
I want to check that out, too.

80
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,600
Loki, how was your game of the week?

81
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,880
I didn't play too much.

82
00:04:53,880 --> 00:05:00,640
I did get to play a new game for the PSP, which is just some Hudson pinball game, where

83
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:06,640
Where you actually play it sideways, just like Star Soldier, didn't like it.

84
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,300
It was just pinball and I got bored with it really quick.

85
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:12,880
There's better games to be playing on the PSP than pinball.

86
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:19,240
And you know, with only two boards unlocked at the beginning, it was just pretty lame.

87
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:22,540
Not a good thing to be playing on the PSP.

88
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:27,040
The other game I played of course was More Wheel of Katamari, and that's still fun.

89
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,380
It doesn't get boring at all.

90
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:33,420
the game I haven't been playing is in 10 Dogs because I'm tired of that game now

91
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:37,980
and I'm not feeding my dog so the hell with the dog. My dog floated to the top of the bowl.

92
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:41,540
You need to bring Taco over so I can play with Taco

93
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:44,620
before he runs away. Alright.

94
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:48,220
That's it? That's, well, Burnout.

95
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:51,940
Burnout Revenge. I've been playing that but

96
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:56,300
I'm going to check out some different games this week. I've got XSX on tour

97
00:05:56,300 --> 00:06:00,460
so I'm anticipating Warriors which is coming out this week

98
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:04,260
so I'll definitely be reviewing that. My gaming week

99
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:08,700
I've been playing Castlevania DS still I know I talked about last week but I love it

100
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:12,060
I love it it's a great game so I've been playing a lot more of that and honestly not a

101
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,140
whole lot of new stuff

102
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:16,560
until today the day we're recording this show

103
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,980
I finally caved and I bought World of Warcraft so I could join the 1.5

104
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:26,160
gazillion other people, isn't the official number 1.5 gazillion people

105
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,900
playing World of Warcraft, I think.

106
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:28,900
Indeed it is.

107
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:32,600
Yes, because you can tell because there's 1.5 gazillion servers and all of my friends

108
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,200
are on different ones.

109
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:37,440
So no matter which server I play on, I'm going to piss somebody off.

110
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,600
So I think I finally narrowed it down to a couple, and I know Dark Sakura and I will

111
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,120
both be playing on one of those servers together, so it'll be cool.

112
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,360
It will be on Scarlet Crusade.

113
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,360
Yes.

114
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,360
And we're both playing Alliance.

115
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,360
Please don't cyberstalk us.

116
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,360
Yes.

117
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,280
But I'm not saying who our characters are or what.

118
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,840
Because they won't be named after ourselves.

119
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,000
But if you want to cyberstalk us, send us an email, you never know.

120
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,400
I was, somebody sent me an email that says, hey I want to add you to Xbox Live and I said

121
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,400
okay, why not?

122
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,400
And then they kicked my ass in Halo.

123
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,960
I'm wondering if they're doing new gamer tags for Xbox Live for the 360.

124
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,880
I'm curious about that too, because I want to try and get Sky, just Sky, but...

125
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:12,880
Same.

126
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,800
I don't think I'll be able to do it, but I will be willing to, you know, get on Xbox

127
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,680
Live right when I get the game, so...

128
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:22,920
Because I don't have just plain old Sky on regular Xbox right now.

129
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,920
I have something else.

130
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:30,920
I really haven't played enough of it yet, I mean I'm level 3, I'm playing a gnome character.

131
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,920
David the gnome?

132
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:40,920
No, I was thinking of the Strangers with Candy reference. We're gonna go kill the gnomes. I don't even remember the line, but I just remember it was really funny.

133
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,920
I'm playing a night elf.

134
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,920
Total inside joke, sorry guys. But I'm playing a warlock, but I'm more like level 3 right now.

135
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,760
but more like level three right now but I thought it's pretty badass because I

136
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,680
actually got a spell where you can set something on fire

137
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,400
and that was cool, like actually setting it on fire. I have not left Final Fantasy 11

138
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,880
I'm just gonna try and balance the two games, I'm gonna balance the two games for a little while

139
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,880
there's things about Final Fantasy 11 that were really starting to get to me

140
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:05,200
so I want to play World of Warcraft, see what, no

141
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,800
there's things I like about Final Fantasy 11, there's things I dislike about Final Fantasy 11

142
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:11,380
I really need to sit down and dedicate time to play the game

143
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:15,280
I haven't played in months and I really, I don't want to give it up

144
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,800
I still want to play the game, but I need to dedicate a day or something

145
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,680
in which the fiance will not interfere with the game

146
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,960
and I get to play. I need to give WoW a fair shot because honestly

147
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:29,760
I owe it to our listeners to give an unbiased

148
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:34,400
perspective of what's going on in WoW. Let's give away some crap. You should send me a letter.

149
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:38,880
We'll see. Let's give away some crap. Last week we promised we would give away some

150
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,400
crap.

151
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:43,880
We're gonna give away a copy of Death Junior and pull a number out of the hat

152
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:27,880
see dig dig dig dig dig dig 12 number 12 is gonna be this one it's Jason and

153
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:31,960
there's no last name but I think it's cute because the username it's coming

154
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:36,160
from a gmail address and this is not the same as the username but it's a otaku

155
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,900
land is how their name comes out otaku land is one of our also regular writers

156
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:16,540
pz.com, that has people who deal in import games, trading import games, and someone on

157
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:18,540
there has panorama cotton.

158
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:25,180
They want $500 freaking dollars for it, and I said, uh, no, but they do trade in the rare.

159
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:27,540
That would be a great Christmas present.

160
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:34,260
If some dear listener wants to spend $500 on little old me, I ain't stopping you.

161
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:35,740
You're a sucker, for one.

162
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:36,740
I ain't stopping you.

163
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:38,620
All right, well, congratulations to our two winners there.

164
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:41,380
I'm glad some people that are involved in the show could win those.

165
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:42,380
So good job, guys!

166
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,860
We will do another giveaway very soon.

167
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:45,080
Tune in next week.

168
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,080
Maybe we'll have something next week.

169
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,460
Loki, do we have anything in the prize vault for next week?

170
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:48,460
Do we know?

171
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:53,280
I've got an assortment of anime soundtracks, like a ton of them.

172
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,280
So possibly.

173
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,460
Okay, well we'll just have to give a whole lot of those away.

174
00:10:56,460 --> 00:11:00,060
So alright, we'll see what happens.

175
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:03,860
Let's get into some actual gaming news tonight.

176
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:07,460
I'm gonna let Dark Sakura start it off because Dark Sakura has an interesting little follow-up

177
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:11,980
to the state law here in California, which everyone's been screaming about.

178
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:14,700
Somebody's taken action against this law, aren't they, DarkSakura?

179
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:19,460
Yes, and basically it's a lot of the stuff that we've brought out about, you know, first

180
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:29,380
of all, the MPAA being a private entity, you know, basically raiding the movies now, but

181
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:35,980
we have the government controlling what video games can be sold, you know, where's the equality

182
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:36,980
in that.

183
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:39,860
Basically, the Entertainment Software Association

184
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:41,740
is planning to sue the state of California

185
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:45,220
over the passage of AB 1179, the bill that

186
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:47,260
outlawed the sale of violent video games to minors.

187
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:53,020
They're very confident that they're going to win.

188
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:56,580
They've got the arguments very well.

189
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:58,500
They basically, from what I understand,

190
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,960
have taken the law and broken the new bill that's passed

191
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:06,020
and broken it down item by item, and also

192
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:12,040
Comparing it to what the current laws are, actually there's one in particular that is

193
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:15,140
actually the first one used.

194
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:23,700
Actually the person who wrote this article did a comparison by showing the law about

195
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:29,420
the sale of alcohol to minors compared with the law regarding the game sale.

196
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:34,460
And the game sale one reads as this, except as otherwise provided in subdivision C. Every

197
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:08,900
Violent video game means a video game in which the range of options available to a player

198
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:13,500
includes killing, maiming, dismembering, or sexually assaulting the image of a human being

199
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:17,420
if those acts are depicted in the game in a manner that does either or it goes into

200
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:27,940
the whole outline of it.

201
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:35,220
A lot of what it's going into, as far as trying to define, is that it's going on the assumption

202
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:39,700
that it's depicting a violent act on a person.

203
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:43,540
Thing is, is that they're not people.

204
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:45,380
They're video game images.

205
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:48,100
Without rehashing this whole same argument over and over again, though, because it seems

206
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:51,460
like we've had something about violent video games like every week on this program for

207
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:52,460
the last three months.

208
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,980
The point is, it's not a clear law.

209
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:56,060
That's what I'm saying.

210
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,060
Who makes that definition?

211
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,060
What is violent?

212
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:01,100
Who makes that definition and who's checking on them because we got a system of checks

213
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,440
and balances in this country.

214
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,720
Who's checking on the people that are making these calls?

215
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,720
That's what I want to know.

216
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:10,820
The whole point it makes here is how clear the sale of alcohol law is in comparison to

217
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:17,900
this piece of crap video game law because item by item, it goes into lots of definition

218
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:23,900
as to what these items are but the thing is that it's not clear.

219
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:30,620
How can something suffer when the same something does not exist?

220
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:35,780
I don't necessarily disagree with trying to control the sale of games, just like you would

221
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:43,140
say that an under 17 person shouldn't buy an R-rated DVD, but my whole thing is that

222
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:49,540
the bill is so vague that it seems like it's just prepared to be there to target things

223
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:52,540
when they come out like Grand Theft Auto.

224
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:57,280
It's built so that when somebody kills somebody and blames Grand Theft Auto, that's when people

225
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,260
are going to panic and say, who sold them the game?

226
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:00,260
Find them.

227
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:01,260
Invoke the law.

228
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:04,220
But my question is, no, no, before that all happens, who is making the determination what

229
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:05,220
is a value?

230
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:06,220
That's my biggest problem with the law.

231
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:09,700
Otherwise, you know, whatever, I suppose they have to do what they have to do, and I'm okay

232
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,340
with them, you know.

233
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:16,300
I was all for ratings, because ratings puts the power in the hands of those who should

234
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,440
possess it, the parents.

235
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,060
Why not have the bill just adopt the ratings that are in place right now?

236
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:21,060
You know what this is?

237
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:25,060
Basically, legalizing censorship as far as...

238
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:27,060
In a way, in a way.

239
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:29,060
It's limiting free expression.

240
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:33,060
It's not stopping the games from being made, no, but...

241
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:35,060
But it's putting the scarlet letter on them?

242
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:39,060
Yeah, that's exactly it. That's a great comparison right there.

243
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:43,060
But let's face it, in some of our demographic, I know for me,

244
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:47,060
the games that have the scarlet letter on them, or should I say the scarlet number,

245
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:51,660
I'm going to be more attracted to and go, ooh, do I get to see some titties in this

246
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:52,660
one?

247
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:53,660
Exactly.

248
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:54,660
I want more titties in my games.

249
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:57,340
No, they're going to be preventing kids from buying them.

250
00:15:57,340 --> 00:16:02,420
That means Rockstar, the gloves are off, do whatever the fuck you want, just release the

251
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:03,420
games.

252
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,700
Anyway, all right.

253
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:14,100
I think, I look at this as the government basically trying to take the power from the

254
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:18,360
people trying to take the responsibility out of the people's hands.

255
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:26,360
I think that, well, I do admit the game companies do have a duty of responsibility to the consumer

256
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,400
to make sure that the product that they put on the market is exactly what they say they're

257
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,400
selling.

258
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,400
Exactly.

259
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:36,360
And to rate the game appropriately and market the game towards the appropriate audience.

260
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:41,080
To compare, when I was studying business law, they brought up a case about a woman who was

261
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:48,220
suing over having pieces of clam shell in her clam chowder, and she broke a tooth, so

262
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:50,020
she sued.

263
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:58,380
The thing is that there is an expectation that there may be clam shell in the game.

264
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,980
She lost, not in the game, but in the soup.

265
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:03,540
Warning, this game may contain clam parts.

266
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:10,640
But she lost the case, because under the rights and responsibility for safe food handling,

267
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:16,460
having bits and pieces in that, chicken soup, you know, or you may have a fish bone in your

268
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:17,460
fish fillet.

269
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:27,380
Now, to compare, when you buy a game that is rated M, you should expect that there's

270
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:30,120
going to be mature themes in the game.

271
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:38,560
You may see some boobies, you may hear the F word, regardless, you have been warned by

272
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:42,920
By that little end, being on the bottom of the game, you have been warned.

273
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:46,280
Now, I do think that Rockstar was lax.

274
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:51,120
I mean, and even so, I can't really fault this either.

275
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:56,160
You know, removing the code, bracketing it out, that's done all the time.

276
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,920
Aren't we feeling a little blue in the face here?

277
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,920
I am.

278
00:17:58,920 --> 00:17:59,920
All right.

279
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:04,000
But, you know, honestly, there is and is not fault in that.

280
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,200
Technically, they did remove access to it.

281
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:09,440
It just happened to be somebody out there who's curious enough to find it.

282
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,440
No easy answer.

283
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,440
All right.

284
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,440
We welcome your feedback, as always.

285
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,440
ToGo at orangelaunchradio.com.

286
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,440
I'm tired of talking about this subject.

287
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,440
All right.

288
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,440
Then let's get to a new one.

289
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,840
Let's talk about, ooh, Digital Life happened this weekend, which was that big expo in New

290
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:22,580
York, which I really wanted to go to, but I couldn't, but I heard it was very crowded.

291
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:26,360
We had some folks call in on our live show Sunday nights that were at Digital Life saying

292
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:30,680
that just crowded amongst crowded, just really, really crowded stuff.

293
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:33,480
A few folks got to check out some new games, though.

294
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:37,800
One thing that did happen was that the Xbox Live Arcade lineup was announced.

295
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:41,160
Now Loki, I know you talked about this a little bit last week because you had some photos

296
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:44,640
of some of the games in development, but they did kind of officially say what's going to

297
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,640
be in it.

298
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,360
What I think is interesting, a whole lot of PopCap games showing up.

299
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:52,380
Astro Pop, Bejeweled 2, Zuma going to be in there.

300
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:57,160
Some other games in there as well, Gauntlet, Joust, and then of course the Marble Blaster

301
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:01,200
talking about Robotron and Smash TV, which is kind of interesting to me that they would

302
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,760
to put these in the arcade when you can just buy the Midway Arcade Treasures collection,

303
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,960
which would be a much better deal, I think, for some of those games.

304
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,240
Remember, don't shoot the food.

305
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:12,600
Yeah, I know. That's not the complete list, but those are the only games that sound very

306
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:20,020
familiar to me. So check that out if you're curious on your Xbox 360 when you get that.

307
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:25,880
Also on the Xbox 360, this is interesting, they're doing this in Japan. They're going

308
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:30,880
to be doing a beta test of Final Fantasy XI on the brand new Xbox 360. The console launches

309
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:38,120
in Japan on December 10th, and if you purchase the limited edition Xbox 360 package, you're

310
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:44,620
going to get a free Final Fantasy XI beta test disk while supplies last. Interesting.

311
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:45,620
Japan only though.

312
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:46,620
Of course.

313
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:47,620
Sorry guys.

314
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:48,620
We're going to start looking for them on Yahoo!

315
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:49,620
Actions Japan.

316
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:55,480
Even though we're getting the system first, they get to beta test Final Fantasy XI. Isn't

317
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,480
that lovely?

318
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:03,960
Alright, now DarkSakura, you have a story about the 360 as well and some kind of bad

319
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,080
news about the dev kits.

320
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:13,960
Yeah, we did cover about the theft of the 360 dev kit.

321
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:17,560
I think so, but if we didn't, I'm sure people read about it or heard about it on another

322
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,560
cast or something.

323
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,560
But yeah, some dev kits were stolen.

324
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:27,080
At any rate, a Dutch newspaper reported that Microsoft is going to be preparing a $100

325
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:36,080
million lawsuit against those responsible for the theft, because they're wanting to

326
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:41,600
protect the security so that you can't hack the Xbox 360, which you know is a big problem

327
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,160
with the Xbox here is that they pretty much broke it right away.

328
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:50,440
And we started having the name on the Xbox and extra huge hard drives and...

329
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,620
Look, Ui, you're laughing.

330
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:56,340
I'm laughing because the way they set up the whole hard drive situation anyways is just

331
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:57,900
asking to be hacked.

332
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:01,700
Let's include the game on the hard drive that runs on the operating system.

333
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:06,220
No, no one's gonna take that off the hard drive and figure out how it works.

334
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:07,220
No, not at all.

335
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:09,740
That'll never happen.

336
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:14,580
They're just like, okay, we're gonna leave this door unlocked, now we're trusting.

337
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:19,000
You're not going to break in, because if you do, you'll be sorry, you know, so it's like,

338
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
come on.

339
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,060
There's also an interesting statement on here, though, from the hacking group who's, I guess,

340
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:26,060
responsible.

341
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:30,020
It's from, I hope I'm saying this wrong, it's SmartXX.com.

342
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:32,800
You hope you're saying that wrong?

343
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,340
He said, I hope I'm saying that wrong.

344
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:36,140
I said, I hope I'm not saying that wrong.

345
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:37,140
Oh, my bad.

346
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:40,140
I threw a ferret at you.

347
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:41,140
Anyway.

348
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:47,460
They are saying the pictures of stolen dev kits emerged claiming Microsoft was actually

349
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:51,620
complicit in the group's acquisition of the kits.

350
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:59,940
They went on to say, according to the poster, people within Microsoft unaware of the operation

351
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:04,520
went on to inform the police that they should investigate SmartXX leading to the current

352
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:10,380
situation and that Microsoft was going to deny it as usual.

353
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:25,180
Speaking of people getting busted, a game pirate in Richmond, Texas was sentenced to

354
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:32,420
three years and ten months in a federal prison and a fine of $1.15 million.

355
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:38,860
Dashieau Ponce de Leon, receiving this sentence there, that 1.15 million dollars representing

356
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:42,180
the retail value of all the software this guy sold.

357
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:44,380
Now this guy wasn't doing the thing on BitTorrent or anything.

358
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:48,620
This guy was actually downloading stuff online then reselling it through the internet.

359
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:50,340
That's the worst kind of piracy right there.

360
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,700
That's the kind that a lot of people say even if they want to.

361
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:55,420
That hurts the pockets of the developers.

362
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:57,700
And just downloading off BitTorrent doesn't?

363
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:00,100
Well, stop making crappy games.

364
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:06,100
One person as opposed to one person multiplying the efforts. I buy games look at my collection

365
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:10,740
I have tons of games that I pay money. I don't think that anyone who my house

366
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:15,980
Cannot say that I don't buy a lot of games. I just don't want to buy an import system. So

367
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:22,680
Anyway, so there's that I just thought it was interesting because that kind of made news is like they got one pirate and that made

368
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,180
News, I don't know

369
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:26,180
Struck me a scar

370
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:33,180
Alright, let's get into this guy because, my god, this guy gets in the news an awful

371
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:35,780
lot and we've got like four stories on this guy this week.

372
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:37,140
Everyone's favorite butthead!

373
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:41,660
It's Jack Thompson, boys and girls, this is the guy, god, you gotta know who this guy

374
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:42,660
is right now.

375
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:44,460
I am so sick of this loser.

376
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:46,980
He needs to team up with a guy from the 700 Club.

377
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:50,940
I know, I know, but anyway, this is the guy who, you know, was saying, video games are

378
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:51,940
evil.

379
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:57,580
people refute him with backing up everything with solid evidence and then he goes, ìYouíre

380
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:58,580
just a piss ant.î

381
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:03,100
Well, I thought this was interesting is that earlier this week you might have heard the

382
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:08,300
National Institute on Media and the Family, NIMF, the President David Walsh kind of wrote

383
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:12,980
a letter that kind of distanced himself from Jack Thompson and said, ìI really wish youíd

384
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:19,140
stop using our name in your arguments and stuff.î A quote from the letter here, ìYour

385
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:27,200
commentary has included extreme hyperbole and your tactics have included personally

386
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,280
attacking individuals for whom I have a great deal of respect."

387
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,960
I thought that was very interesting.

388
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:35,040
Get this, Dr. Thompson fought back.

389
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,920
Dr. Thompson fought back.

390
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:38,920
Is he a doctor?

391
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,920
No, he's not a doctor.

392
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:47,280
He's a doctor of things he can't say on the air.

393
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:52,060
fuse two words together there. Anyway, what he did there is that he actually

394
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:57,280
kind of denied saying, the fact is I have never suggested that Dr. Walsh approves of

395
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:01,020
what I do. I have countless times told people that I believe he is an expert around the

396
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:05,080
dangers of video games. The mistake I made apparently naively is thinking that a person

397
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:09,800
of his expertise would use it actually to help some bereaved families rather than choose

398
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:13,640
to protect his relationship with portions of the video game industry and its reckless

399
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:16,420
retail network.

400
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:20,760
And then he goes on to say, I'm a Christian, and I think Dr. Walsh is as well, and there's

401
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:26,880
a passage in the New Testament, yada yada yada yada, thou shall not play violent video

402
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:27,880
games.

403
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:34,960
I'm really wondering why people keep bringing up Christianity as an illustration of morality.

404
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,840
That's a whole other topic for a whole other cast.

405
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:41,720
I know, I know, I'm not going to go into it, it's just I find it highly hilarious how he's

406
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:44,960
defending himself saying, oh but I'm a Christian. Yet he's going around

407
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:49,080
basically slandering innocent people. You know,

408
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:52,560
and like I said before, when people are presenting him with evidence that

409
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:57,080
proves him wrong, he's going back and calling them names.

410
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:00,720
From what, and I don't want to get into religious debate, but from what I understand about Christianity

411
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:04,120
there's only one judge. Oh, he's

412
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:07,680
gonna have to answer to it. There's only one judge. No, it's not Wapner.

413
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:10,880
Alright. Judge Wapner guy.

414
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,880
No, he's doing the pet court or something.

415
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,880
Oh!

416
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:14,880
Just Robner's cool.

417
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,880
God, if he did die, that would be really sad.

418
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:16,880
I don't think he died.

419
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,880
I think he's alive and well.

420
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,880
He's still alive, I think.

421
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,880
He's doing the pet court thing.

422
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:20,880
I think that man must be indestructible then.

423
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,880
Anyway.

424
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:25,880
Some other news on Thompson, didn't you have a little side note to that, Dark Sakura?

425
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:26,880
I thought you did.

426
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:27,880
Something.

427
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:28,880
Well, Loki, you had something.

428
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:35,960
Yeah, that one of the people that he happened to have issues with compared him to Hitler,

429
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:36,960
which I found hilarious.

430
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:37,960
Interesting.

431
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:38,960
I don't know.

432
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:39,960
I don't find Hitler hilarious.

433
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:46,680
No, I'll take that back. Jack Thompson compared this guy to Hitler, and that's one of the

434
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,840
people that this group associates with.

435
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,960
One of the things I was going to mention is, remember last week we were talking about how

436
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:59,320
he was proposing that game companies create his game. Anyway, Penny Arcade, of course,

437
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:03,520
he said he would pay $10,000 if his game was created. They were like, well, that's kind

438
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:08,480
of weak because we donated half a million dollars for this charity. So what did he do?

439
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:14,240
He found their phone number in their signature that was in their email and yelled at them,

440
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:19,720
literally. Called them up and yelled. That was pretty lame.

441
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:23,720
This guy is obviously mentally unstable. Now obviously this guy is becoming kind of

442
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:29,880
like the laughing stock of the video game community, so now you're seeing him in all

443
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:36,240
sorts of mods and what did you find? Well, it's the Jack Thompson murder simulator

444
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:44,200
called Defamation of Character, and it's basically a mod for Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, and

445
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:54,000
you can find this at hellfish.gtajunkies.com, and it's basically got his story. It's a video

446
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,200
game featuring Jack Thompson doing incredibly violent things, in this particular case murdering

447
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:01,160
Janet Reno and Doug Lowenstein, among others.

448
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,760
That was the guy you compared to Hitler.

449
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:07,400
Basically, they kind of go through what you can do.

450
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:16,720
He is Jack Thompson, who also is his alter ego, Ban Man, who they actually have dressed

451
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,200
up in some weird box and just some funny stuff.

452
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:28,280
Anyways, you go through a bunch of different missions, including murdering, I believe it

453
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:30,720
was two live crew, if I remember correctly.

454
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,320
I don't think they're going to like that very much.

455
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:38,920
Yeah, you're murdering two left crew who they have a picture on the website hanging, looks

456
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,840
like upside down, dead from his ceiling.

457
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:44,720
He was actually also the one responsible for the whole cop killer thing with Ice-T.

458
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,120
Some of you guys have a lot of free time, I noticed out there.

459
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,120
Yeah.

460
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,120
Some of you gamers have a lot of free time.

461
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,720
But I thought here's what was funny though.

462
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:56,440
Some of the special abilities he had, he can do, of course, bullet time like every other

463
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,440
game.

464
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:01,400
He has legal immunity, basically when the police are coming or whatever, you can instantly

465
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:07,500
to get them to go away. He has the Holy Escort, which is this Harrier jet that makes him invincible

466
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:14,840
or something, and Press Relations, which you can basically just pull publicity stunt and

467
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,240
get everyone to forget about stuff.

468
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:20,500
Beautiful. Beautiful. Beautiful. All right. You know what? I need some real morality here

469
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:26,000
on this show. I need some real morality, and I turned to Dark Sakura to bring that morality

470
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,680
to this program, and she provides that for us every week with her weekly advice column,

471
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:34,560
because you know there is more to life than just gaming because if uh...

472
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:37,980
you played video games all day long you would have no time to watch the people's

473
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:40,160
court

474
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:43,500
Judge Wapner was cool. I know. Even that new lady that's on it is pretty awesome.

475
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,840
She's pretty awesome. I just don't watch TV.

476
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:50,680
Anyway, so DarkStalker, what are you going to be telling the kids about tonight?

477
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,840
Today's bit of advice

478
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:55,760
is excuses you can make for falling asleep at your desk at work and then how to fake

479
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,640
being asleep at work.

480
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,760
Awesome. I need this. I need to know this.

481
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,960
To be asleep at your desk, first of all blame work.

482
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,080
Say I'm so exhausted I was here until midnight last night.

483
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,720
Do not attempt this if your boss works late and you do not.

484
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:14,580
You know, I had a fellow coworker actually say that to me the other day.

485
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:16,680
I wonder if that was something they were doing.

486
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:19,340
Number two, blame medication.

487
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:22,120
Claim that your new allergy medicine has been making you drowsy.

488
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,640
Say those antihistamines just knock me out.

489
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,860
It usually works for me because I hate men and girls.

490
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:29,520
Number three, blame lunch.

491
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:34,600
say, �Wow, I guess I should not have eaten that turkey sandwich. Tryptophan always makes

492
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:38,600
me sleepy.�

493
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:43,400
Be aware when taking a nap. Always rest your elbow on your desk and keep your arm perpendicular

494
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:48,600
to the desktop. Your forehead should rest on your four fingers. Your thumb, spread apart

495
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:52,640
from the fingers, should support your jaw. This position will keep your head up and aimed

496
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:57,480
at your desk. Face in a direction so that it is not immediately visible to someone approaching

497
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:03,000
your desk so that your eyes are closed. Keep an important group of documents in your perceived

498
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,240
line of sight so as to appear to be reading intently.

499
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:16,240
Do not stay up all night playing Final Fantasy XI, you freakin' addicts.

500
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:22,240
or World of Warcraft or Ragnarok or whatever the hell the kids are playing these days.

501
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,240
I never let that get in the way of my sleeve.

502
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:30,240
I said when I was unemployed and had no excuse to go to bed.

503
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:33,240
We've got some music game news for you guys tonight.

504
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:37,240
Because you know, Orange Lounge, we were all about the music games when we started.

505
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,240
We still are to some extent, but we talk about other video games too.

506
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,240
But this is some big music game news.

507
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:43,240
We've got Guitar Hero.

508
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,240
It's that brand new game coming out.

509
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:49,880
Those of you guys that were wishing and hoping that they would make like amplitude or frequency

510
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:52,840
like a new one, from what I understand, they kind of have.

511
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:56,440
They kind of did make a new one except it just involves a guitar and it's called Guitar

512
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,440
Hero.

513
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,600
Red Octane is the company that's putting this out.

514
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:01,880
Red Octane, of course, is famous for making a lot of music game peripherals.

515
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:02,880
And harmonics.

516
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:03,880
And harmonics.

517
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,880
Harmonics being the folks that did bring us amplitude.

518
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:12,360
Harmonics developed the game, absolutely, and made Karaoke Revolution as well.

519
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:16,800
X just wrapped up work on Guitar Hero, and Red Octane is going to put it out.

520
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:19,400
It's scheduled to be out November 8th.

521
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,400
Should be interesting.

522
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:26,400
A lot of licensed songs in this game, including More Than a Feelin' by Boston, ZZ Top, Sharp

523
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:29,080
Dressed Man, and Franz Ferdinand's Take Me Out.

524
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:31,640
Now something interesting happened this past week, didn't it?

525
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:36,100
I played More Than a Feelin' on Guitar Hero.

526
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:40,440
We recorded a segment for the local news, KCRA.

527
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,040
Nice folks.

528
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:48,860
Playtesting guitar hero, and it was me and loki got to play it on my I had other other TV. I had other commitments

529
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:52,180
First of all I have to say that that game looks

530
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:54,700
Visually looks very sharp

531
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:59,960
Being of an artistic background myself all the lights were singing that came was really cool

532
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:02,300
The character models were great

533
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:07,440
There's even a Keith Richards look-alike who and me being the big gorillas fangirl that I am I was like

534
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:12,040
first of all seeing that hair and sing and play a flying V I was like oh my

535
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:15,640
god it's Murdoch but it it was really just based directly off of Keith

536
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:19,800
Richards which he was based off of Keith Richards too anyway back away from my

537
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:29,560
nerdom um it has an excellent song list um I played um I want to be sedated and

538
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:34,640
then I played more than a feelin which I love Boston and I love the Ramones so

539
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:41,840
There was also Stevie Ray Vaughan in it, Franz Ferdinand, Megadeth, and it's not the actual

540
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,400
bands, but the folks that they had play in the music was just...

541
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:48,000
Kind of like Karaoke Revolution, where they have a cover band do it, yeah.

542
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,920
But there was some real skill that went into the guitar playing on the game, and on top

543
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:54,920
of that, the controller.

544
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:58,880
First of all, the controller design was body style licensed by Gibson.

545
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:02,320
Gibson and MTV are both backing the game.

546
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:08,040
In fact, the guitars in the game are all licensed by Gibson.

547
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,040
Sounds cool.

548
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,040
Loki, I'm curious what you thought.

549
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,040
It was awesome.

550
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:24,300
I got to play Smoke on the Water, and Iron Man, and he was like, take me out, and just

551
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:25,300
really cool.

552
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:30,840
A really fun game to get into, since I'm a big fan of Guitar Freaks, this is definitely

553
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:34,180
step in the right direction, because I like how they have the extra buttons on there so

554
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:37,580
it is a little bit more difficult, so for those people that did actually master, you

555
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:41,460
know, Guitar Freaks, this is a whole new challenge for you.

556
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:46,500
Yeah, I'm just, I didn't get to play it, unfortunately, but I'm just excited that we're getting like

557
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:50,660
amplitude, but like different with a new peripheral, I'm just, because I love frequency, I loved

558
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:52,140
amplitude, I'm kind of excited.

559
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:55,720
Being that I heavily imported all the Guitar Freaks games that I could get my hands on

560
00:34:55,720 --> 00:35:01,080
except for the appends there's no comparison this game guitar hero really

561
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:05,080
blows it out of the water the music quality being that you're going from

562
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:10,840
basically MIDI to real you know instruments guitar freaks has also just

563
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:14,120
kind of gotten stale over like 13 mixes or something like that right it's like

564
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:19,920
Simon it's like playing Simon you know press the button in the right order but

565
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:23,600
this because you've got the five keys and on top of that the way that you move

566
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:27,960
your hand they're calling him fret buttons I think you've got a whammy bar

567
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:33,760
on it geez how much cooler can you get I mean I know I'm gushing about it but I

568
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:39,200
I've got my game on reserve already the controller itself is suitably more

569
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:43,520
substantial than the guitar freaks controller $69.99 is what it's gonna set

570
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:48,680
you back and it comes out November 8th T for teen it must have some hard lyrics

571
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:49,680
in there or something.

572
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:50,680
It's not an EA game.

573
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:51,680
We've got Megadeth.

574
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,680
I guess so.

575
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,840
You know, throw the horns.

576
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:55,840
Sounds good.

577
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,760
Also, another music gaming related story.

578
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,760
I thought this was interesting.

579
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:02,560
Of course, you know Konami puts out Dance Dance Revolution well.

580
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:06,920
What they're doing is they are teaming up with 24 Hour Fitness, which I think is very

581
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,280
interesting.

582
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:13,720
They're going to be putting a 30-day free gym pass to 24 Hour Fitness inside copies

583
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,760
of DDR Extreme 2, the new ones.

584
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,500
ones I mean obviously it's already been being sold but as the new ones come out

585
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:22,840
they're gonna have a 30-day free pass 24-hour Fitness and 24-hour Fitness is

586
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:29,300
going to put DDR machines in their kids club portions of the gyms not I don't

587
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:31,900
think they have kids club at all the gyms but you know the ones that do they're

588
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:35,020
some of them are gonna have DDR machines so an interesting confusion there

589
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:39,700
between Dance Dance Revolution and a legitimate gymnasium interesting I think

590
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:43,940
that it's a fascinating marketing tool and it's sort of one that we see we've

591
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:48,180
seen it coming. With all the schools that are putting DDR machines in their fitness

592
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:52,500
programs, it was inevitable.

593
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:56,940
Konami was also working on DDR Studio, I think it was, where they actually, it was going

594
00:36:56,940 --> 00:37:02,820
to be like an eight-person DDR thing, and it was crazy. It was meant for gyms, although

595
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:06,400
we didn't really see if this ever got actually implemented. It's interesting to see this

596
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,060
partnership take place, so.

597
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:11,540
I still think Pata Pata would have been a better choice.

598
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:13,260
Yeah, but no.

599
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:16,220
Get your upper body moving, but then you'd have to listen to the music.

600
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:17,220
I didn't mean anything.

601
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:18,220
I'm kidding.

602
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:19,220
There's nothing wrong with the Eurobeat.

603
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:20,220
I'm kidding.

604
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:24,420
I watch Initial D. Rhythm gymnastics, the game.

605
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:25,420
Alright.

606
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:26,420
Rhythm masters.

607
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:29,460
Now, you guys have some news on Dead or Alive 4.

608
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:30,460
I want to hear this stuff.

609
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:32,860
Dark Soccer, what did you have on Dead or Alive 4?

610
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:33,860
DOA4.

611
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:36,540
Well, their lobby system has been revealed.

612
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:40,380
Famitsu was talking about it.

613
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:44,120
The description that I have seen is that it is a

614
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:47,780
wacky. The lobby features 10 various

615
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:51,240
areas. There's like a Halloween theme, a swamp room that you swim through.

616
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:54,480
Which, you know, honestly it totally just

617
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:58,920
fits, you know, what I would have expected of me if they gave us a Volleyball.

618
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:02,300
They'd have to do something goofy. You also have

619
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:06,340
various avatars. I believe that there is around 30.

620
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:11,020
You also can have like a ninja, ghost, cat,

621
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:14,780
penguin. You get a penguin, Rom? Awesome. And

622
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:18,940
each lobby can hold a maximum of 20 people and you can chat with people and watch

623
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:21,700
fights that are taking place on a widescreen display.

624
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:24,860
No screenshots yet,

625
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:28,120
but of course there's shots of the game out there.

626
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:32,400
But it was in the recent issue of Famitsu. Interesting. Before I get to Loki's side, I just want to say

627
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,200
something real quick about Famitsu Magazine

628
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:37,480
because it kinda relates to Xbox. They actually just did a study on how the

629
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:40,160
Japanese are kinda looking at the next generation of systems.

630
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:45,360
24 percent say that they do want to get an Xbox 360. 40 percent

631
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:49,480
are still undecided. PlayStation 3, way ahead still.

632
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:53,160
But it's interesting because the Xbox is making a little bit of progress because the Xbox

633
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:56,320
One or whatever you want to call it, the regular Xbox, kinda

634
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:59,880
thudded in Japan a little bit. But 360 seems to be getting more awareness.

635
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:00,880
That's very interesting.

636
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,840
Loki, what do you have on DLA for?

637
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:06,760
Well, it's been mentioned that there was going to be a guest character in this game, which

638
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:10,160
was going to be from Halo, or the Halo series.

639
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:16,200
The guest character they've announced, and actually have screenshots of, is actually

640
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:21,240
Spartan 458, a female character, I believe from Halo 2.

641
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:25,840
And it, I mean, to be honest, looks exactly like Master Chief.

642
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:28,960
So you get to play this game with this character.

643
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:36,560
They said that possibly some alternate costumes that might reveal more of her, you know?

644
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:39,720
We are forgetting what DOA is all about.

645
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:43,640
Of course they put in a female Master Chief.

646
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:44,640
Of course.

647
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:48,520
If I'm a betting man, I'm going to say the code is probably Justin Bailey.

648
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:49,520
Yeah.

649
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:57,000
Yeah, but I don't think that Was It Tecmo had anything to do with Metroid?

650
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Whatever.

651
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:05,440
Moving on, I've got a quick news for you guys, it relates to Final Fantasy Advent Children.

652
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:11,700
Seven hundred thousand copies sold since September 14th when it came out in Japan, and seven

653
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:17,680
million copies pirated on BitTorrent in the U.S., just kidding, I don't know, I don't

654
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:18,680
know for sure.

655
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:22,920
Don't forget, there's a big pre-order push for that.

656
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:29,900
Even today, on the Advent Children release date schedule, it's basically now the end

657
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:30,900
of January.

658
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:33,620
I think January 29th is what I heard.

659
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:34,620
But then I could be wrong.

660
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:35,620
Oh my, again?

661
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:36,620
No.

662
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:37,620
End of January.

663
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:38,620
Are they foolish?

664
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:39,620
Because this thing's all over the internet.

665
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:41,820
Unless they're going back to add extra content to make us want to get the DVD.

666
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:42,820
I don't know.

667
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:48,220
I think they're going to be pushing, I'm hoping that it's going to be a theater release.

668
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:54,700
Where actually I have heard from other, though I cannot say who, reputable sources that are

669
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:56,900
saying that it's going to be a limited theater run.

670
00:40:56,900 --> 00:41:00,100
Well that would be good.

671
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:01,100
Maybe IMAX?

672
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:04,660
I remember mentioning that a while back, that I had heard that IMAX was what they were gunning

673
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:05,660
for.

674
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:06,660
That would be pretty amazing.

675
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:08,660
That might be a fanboy's wet dream, I don't know.

676
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:09,660
We'll see.

677
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:10,660
It's my wet dream.

678
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:13,600
Anyway, thanks for sharing.

679
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:17,840

but i think that uh...

689
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:40,340
ten kite g

690
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:43,400
I think I know how to pronounce Japanese.

691
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:47,800
Duel Master, Shadow of the Code, Fear, which I know a lot of people are looking forward

692
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,160
to.

693
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:56,520
Fable of the Lost Chapters, Genji, which is already out over here, LA Rush for PS2, Xbox,

694
00:41:56,520 --> 00:42:01,760
Marvel Nemesis, Rise of the Imperfects, Namco Museum, Battle Collection, Pokemon Emerald,

695
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:08,880
Rengoku, UFO Aftershock, WRC Rally Edition, and X3 Reunion.

696
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:15,900
couple of notables of the 28th we have a Dancing Stage Mario mix we have Makai

697
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:20,880
Kingdom Chronicles of the Sacred Tome for PS2 pack and roll on the 28th you

698
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:25,080
mentioned fable in there and our fable lost chapters which is out here already

699
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:28,560
but I just have one quick minor bitch about fable it doesn't work with my TV

700
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:33,180
it looks like garbage on my TV like like my HD wigs out on it like there's

701
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:36,720
something weird about the mode it uses I hope the 360 doesn't do the same thing

702
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:40,720
But that's the only game that I have problems with out of my collection.

703
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:41,720
I have quite a few games.

704
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:42,720
Get the Lost Chapters that's coming out.

705
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:45,720
I don't want the Lost Chapters. I want to play the one I bought.

706
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:47,720
No! You want the Lost Chapters.

707
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:50,720
See something also November just that might be a little fun.

708
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:53,720
Sing Star 80s on the PS2.

709
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:54,720
Sing Star.

710
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:57,720
And Donkey Kong Country 3 for the GBA.

711
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:00,720
I'm like, cool, it's Donkey Kong Country.

712
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:01,720
Alright.

713
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:02,720
Yeah.

714
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:06,720
You also had something about Alien Hominid, which was a game that's out here, but...

715
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,720
What about Alien Hominid?

716
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:14,720
They are releasing downloadable level packs for owners of Alien Hominid for the Xbox.

717
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:22,720
Some of the level packs are saying there's the Chicken Pack and the Ultra Hyperload, both containing 25 levels.

718
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:26,720
And so far, it sounds like they're going to be free downloads.

719
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:31,720
When it said Ultra Hyperload, I was just picturing a long-ass loading screen.

720
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:36,720
Alien Hamed or whatever it's called, not a game that I was very interested in.

721
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:40,720
I watched Loki play it for a length of time and I thought, how boring.

722
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:44,720
I love the comment on here, just a quote from Eurogamer.

723
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:50,720
Mothers, buying your kids 2D shooters will make them better geeks in years to come.

724
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:55,720
I have some news regarding Castlevania because I've been playing, of course, the DS one a lot.

725
00:43:55,720 --> 00:44:00,720
Well, there are brand new Castlevania games coming out for the Xbox and PlayStation 2.

726
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:05,160
It's Curse of Darkness is the game coming out, should be very cool there.

727
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:08,960
It's set three years after Castlevania III, Dracula's Curse,

728
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:12,120
and Curse of Darkness follows, I guess, a new character,

729
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:15,520
Hector, a former minion of Dracula.

730
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:19,680
Should be interesting. November 1st is the day, that's just around the corner.

731
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:24,440
$49.99, M for Mature, because you know it's got lots of blood and the good stuff.

732
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:28,240
Should be a good game though. I hope it's a little better than Lament of

733
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:30,480
Innocence. Not that Lament of Innocence was bad,

734
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:33,480
But it wasn't Symphony of the Night.

735
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:39,480
I'm more looking forward to Matrix of the Path of Neo coming out that same week.

736
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:43,480
I did just find something very interesting that I'm looking forward to.

737
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:44,480
What's that?

738
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:47,480
A Bone game. You remember Bone? The comic?

739
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:49,480
Oh, okay.

740
00:44:49,480 --> 00:45:02,480
I just glanced over here. Telltale Games, apparently they're releasing a bone game.

741
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:03,480
Interesting.

742
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:09,840
Yeah, I will try to go into more of this next week. I just saw this. But I mean, for anyone

743
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:13,320
who's fans of the series, it actually looks pretty cool. I found the link on the front

744
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:17,000
page of Eurogamer this week, so I would suggest everyone check that out.

745
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,200
maybe you'll get some emails on it speaking of emails to go at orange

746
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:21,600
lounge radio dot com

747
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:24,540
we get emails we like to read some of them on the air we don't have time to

748
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:27,080
read all of them but we do read them all

749
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:30,120
and we love you guys for writing us and letting us know you care

750
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:34,240
uh... but we want to respond to some on air right now so dark sakura what is in

751
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:36,400
that the old orange launch radio mailbag

752
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,640
well the uh...

753
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:43,160
the one about the comparing the just how bad that video game law is

754
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:44,840
and that was actually sent to us by rob

755
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:50,800
Oh yeah, he's king of our forums lately too, he's a nice guy.

756
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:53,720
Great addition to our forums, yeah.

757
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:58,400
Also we have one from Paul in Belfast, Northern Ireland.

758
00:45:58,400 --> 00:45:59,640
Oh, right on.

759
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:02,520
I'm really glad to hear we've got listeners so far.

760
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:04,800
International, I love hearing from the international folks.

761
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:07,080
He has a question for us.

762
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:09,320
I will just read this.

763
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:13,440
My question is have you ever given it some thought of doing a video of your podcast for

764
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:16,820
us to download on PSP like they do with DigNation.

765
00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:21,020
It would be totally cool, just a thought.

766
00:46:21,020 --> 00:46:26,520
Here's the problem with videocast is that it's more money to get a video set up and

767
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:27,900
all that stuff.

768
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:29,920
I would love to do it.

769
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:33,760
It's just a matter, the execution is how in the hell are we going to do something like

770
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:34,760
that?

771
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:37,320
When you're talking about dig and stuff like that, I mean that's backed by people who have

772
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:42,800
been in the television industry already, so they kind of have their ties on how to do

773
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:47,440
it do that kind of stuff and we don't really have that we've got I've got a

774
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:52,100
little crappy 15 year old in the recorder but I don't know what kind of a

775
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:55,880
TV show we could do with that let's just it's a lot lot more time because I have

776
00:46:55,880 --> 00:47:00,160
worked in you know television in college and stuff it is more time preparing

777
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:04,700
stuff for the internet is yeah I'm willing to do it but it's again it's

778
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:10,760
just a matter of the fact that we have a budget of zero dollars and no place to

779
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:13,920
shoot it and that once I get my camcorder

780
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:18,520
huh I think that it might might eventually be feasible to do a special

781
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:21,640
it's it's in the back of our minds we want to do it and that that place we

782
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:24,000
were at that that warehouse we were at the other night

783
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,440
I thought would be a fabulous place to do an orange lounge type

784
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:31,040
thing and I told you about that already I I

785
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:33,560
we have ideas it's something that's constantly been sitting in the back my

786
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:34,760
mind someday

787
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:37,840
someday especially with this new iTunes 6.0 and the way that they're really

788
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:39,880
pushing video now with the new video iPods

789
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:44,980
Of course, we like PSPs as well, and we've been trying to support that.

790
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:46,660
It's a natural evolution of the show.

791
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:47,660
I want to see it happen.

792
00:47:47,660 --> 00:47:49,660
It's just not going to happen cheaply.

793
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:52,660
That means I have to go buy a veil.

794
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:53,660
Any other mails?

795
00:47:53,660 --> 00:47:54,660
Yeah.

796
00:47:54,660 --> 00:47:57,820
I won last one tonight.

797
00:47:57,820 --> 00:47:59,700
One of our listeners, Joseph, wrote in.

798
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:01,380
He's won the one-two round.

799
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:02,380
Oh, he won.

800
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:03,380
The rare CD.

801
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:04,380
Yeah.

802
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:06,980
By the way, those prizes are on their way.

803
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:15,940
He would like for us to plug that they're having their Pali Bimani Games Day at Cal

804
00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:29,300
Pali in San Luis Obispo, at the Chumash Auditorium inside the University Union at Cal Pali State.

805
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:33,260
They've asked us to go, but you're going to be busy with the podcast awards that we get.

806
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:38,580
I actually am going to be at the Podcast Awards on the 11th and staying in San Diego to go

807
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:40,860
buy wine.

808
00:48:40,860 --> 00:48:42,180
I might be putting in an appearance.

809
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:46,740
I have to check my calendar, see if I can do it feasibly, but I would like to do it,

810
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:47,740
so we'll see.

811
00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:50,020
I'll get back to these folks.

812
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:51,020
Still seem...

813
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:52,020
Yeah.

814
00:48:52,020 --> 00:48:53,020
Yeah.

815
00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:54,020
We'll see.

816
00:48:54,020 --> 00:48:58,020
Loki's a little harder to get to do the PR things.

817
00:48:58,020 --> 00:49:00,740
Gee, I wonder why.

818
00:49:00,740 --> 00:49:01,740
I want to do it.

819
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:02,740
It sounds like fun.

820
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:03,740
We'll see.

821
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:06,980
I'm not coming by myself, though, so I'm bringing a random...

822
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:10,380
I might have to bring XtoFur from Orange Line Radio's live show.

823
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:11,380
That would be hilarious.

824
00:49:11,380 --> 00:49:12,380
We'll see.

825
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:13,380
We'll see.

826
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:14,380
We'll do it.

827
00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:15,380
Take the DigiCam with you.

828
00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:16,380
If I go, I definitely will.

829
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:18,340
I'll get in touch with this guy on email.

830
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:22,500
But yeah, I'm already going to the podcast awards, or I would be more than thrilled to

831
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:23,500
go.

832
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:24,500
Sorry.

833
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:27,140
I also would like to go to the podcast awards, but I can't, but that's a very bitter subject,

834
00:49:27,140 --> 00:49:29,140
so we won't go there.

835
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:30,140
Yeah.

836
00:49:30,140 --> 00:49:31,140
Real life sucks sometimes.

837
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:32,140
What can you say?

838
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:33,140
I have some more fun, though.

839
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:34,140
Oh, okay.

840
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:35,140
Good.

841
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:36,140
I want fun.

842
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:37,140
You remember our friend Steven Spielberg?

843
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:40,620
Didn't we have lunch with him last week?

844
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:41,620
Actually...

845
00:49:41,620 --> 00:49:42,620
I told him to kiss my ass.

846
00:49:42,620 --> 00:49:44,420
I want more money for the show.

847
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:50,420
I ran into... well, not ran into him, but I was eating dinner at Skywalker Ranch.

848
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:51,420
Is it...

849
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:53,340
George Lucas walked past us and I almost flicked...

850
00:49:53,340 --> 00:49:55,780
You tell that Lucas story every chance you can.

851
00:49:55,780 --> 00:49:56,780
It was cool.

852
00:49:56,780 --> 00:49:57,780
It was cool.

853
00:49:57,780 --> 00:49:58,780
Oh, that's cool.

854
00:49:58,780 --> 00:49:59,780
Oh, my God.

855
00:49:59,780 --> 00:50:00,780
He's in meatloaf-flicking distance.

856
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:01,780
All right.

857
00:50:01,780 --> 00:50:07,700
Little Quickie, he has basically signed a deal with Electronic Arts to publish three

858
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:10,340
original game properties.

859
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:12,740
Will they be overrated like his movies?

860
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:15,500
Likely, but you know, only time will tell.

861
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:16,900
Ooh, I'm looking forward to it.

862
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:18,660
Well, it wouldn't be an original property.

863
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:21,220
Yeah, it's going to be original since no Indiana Jones.

864
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:23,260
I want War of the Worlds.

865
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:29,100
He has been quoted as saying the new technology represents the future of cinema, and in the

866
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:35,400
future, you will physically be inside the experience.

867
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:36,400
Inside the experience.

868
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:40,260
Another thing they were asking how it's going to work, he said, I invented it, but because

869
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:44,540
the patent is pending, I can't discuss it right now.

870
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:49,540
Hopefully being inside the experience includes Pamela Anderson.

871
00:50:49,540 --> 00:50:56,820
Moving on, moving on, let's get to a story that Loki's got about PSP on the TV.

872
00:50:56,820 --> 00:50:58,660
It's something that you've been following for a little while.

873
00:50:58,660 --> 00:51:04,500
Yes, everybody wants the PSP to be on the TV, I mean, you've got the UMD movies which

874
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:06,740
are selling like crazy, of course.

875
00:51:06,740 --> 00:51:15,460
The first thing, of course, they have the PSP2TV, which is actually kind of an add-on

876
00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:19,180
modification that you can do to your PSP system.

877
00:51:19,180 --> 00:51:23,260
The new one now, though, is kind of using, I would say, smoke and mirrors.

878
00:51:23,260 --> 00:51:26,980
It's kind of a device that looks very similar to what they're making for Metal Gear Acid

879
00:51:26,980 --> 00:51:33,060
2 plugs into the top and then I guess like a scanner kind of re-encodes everything and

880
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:36,380
puts it on your TV. I don't know. I don't know about that working.

881
00:51:36,380 --> 00:51:38,220
Sounds crazy. Okay.

882
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:42,340
But it doesn't require modification and I think that's kind of the selling point of

883
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:43,340
it.

884
00:51:43,340 --> 00:51:47,940
Okay. Okay. That's cool. You also had a story about now like a mod for the Nintendo, like

885
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:50,180
with the GBA Micro being so popular right now.

886
00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:58,620
Yes, actually the guy behind all those portable systems, like the portable Atari Ben Heck,

887
00:51:58,620 --> 00:52:06,200
he actually created a brand new NES Micro, as he calls it, and they've got screenshots

888
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:08,520
on his site here on BenHeck.com.

889
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:17,960
The NES Micro is smaller than the cartridge, the cartridge is pretty small, pretty thick

890
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:22,340
also but the cartridge is twice the size of the micro yeah it's still pretty

891
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:26,780
small they have it um you know side by side with the micro and it's about you

892
00:52:26,780 --> 00:52:30,980
know about a half an inch bigger Wow is that is that Ninja Gaiden they're

893
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:35,540
playing right now on the NES micro Mega Man 2 oh I thought I saw Ninja Gaiden

894
00:52:35,540 --> 00:52:37,980
in one of those pictures I was gonna say good choice but Mega Man 2 is a good

895
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:43,220
choice too yeah so that's kind of cool pretty nifty sounds good

896
00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:48,220
Dark Soccer, you had one kind of too bad story about GameStop?

897
00:52:48,220 --> 00:52:50,220
Yeah, last one for me.

898
00:52:50,220 --> 00:52:54,220
GameStop is cutting 700 jobs in the Philadelphia area,

899
00:52:54,220 --> 00:52:57,220
like immediately after this merger has taken place.

900
00:52:57,220 --> 00:53:01,220
They've shut down the corporate office

901
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:04,220
and have also shut down the distribution center.

902
00:53:04,220 --> 00:53:05,220
A VB?

903
00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:06,220
Yes.

904
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:10,220
However, they're saying that other than the game stores currently in existence,

905
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:15,500
since the GameStop ones, they're not going to have that big of a presence, they're not

906
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:19,980
going to really shift things, and from what I've heard, a lot of the EB's are still going

907
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:22,380
to stay and keep operating under the EB name.

908
00:53:22,380 --> 00:53:23,380
Oh, interesting.

909
00:53:23,380 --> 00:53:26,900
So that explains what's going to happen when you have a mall and you have EB, which is

910
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:30,940
like right up, like we have here in Sacramento, we have a mall where the show's based, we

911
00:53:30,940 --> 00:53:34,900
have a mall where there's a GameStop and then like right around the corner there's an EB

912
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:36,260
next to the Cinnabon.

913
00:53:36,260 --> 00:53:38,220
I don't think either of those stores are going anywhere.

914
00:53:38,220 --> 00:53:39,220
Right.

915
00:53:39,220 --> 00:53:46,220
Well, people probably wondered, you know, with a merger is EB going to be GameStop and you just have two GameStops in the mall, which would be a little crazy.

916
00:53:46,220 --> 00:53:55,220
I believe it's still operating under, well, they said, from what I understand, they were supposed to dissolve the EB name, however, the EB stores are still there, so I don't know how they're going to manage that.

917
00:53:55,220 --> 00:53:56,220
Interesting.

918
00:53:56,220 --> 00:53:58,220
Let's say I have GameStop A and GameStop B.

919
00:53:58,220 --> 00:53:59,220
GameStop A and GameStop B.

920
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:00,220
And for the record...

921
00:54:00,220 --> 00:54:07,220
Well, it could be like Express Men and Express Women, they could have GameStop Nintendo and GameStop Xbox and GameStop Sony, it'd be interesting.

922
00:54:07,220 --> 00:54:11,960
I do need to correct myself, though, as far as Barnes & Noble's involvement in that, GameStop

923
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:16,600
is now a fully functioning business.

924
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:21,380
They're still associated with Barnes & Noble, but they are their own business.

925
00:54:21,380 --> 00:54:24,400
No longer a fully owned subsidy, I should say.

926
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:27,400
I got one last story for you guys, and we'll let Loki finish this out tonight, because

927
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:29,720
I think his thing's a little bit cooler.

928
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:32,040
My last thing is Soul Calibur 3.

929
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:33,360
I can't believe I saved this for last.

930
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:34,640
This is big news.

931
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:37,640
Soul Calibur 3, though, for me, it feels like it's been flying under the radar a little

932
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:38,640
bit.

933
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:41,040
Maybe it's just because I'm not following the same news I used to, but I remember Soul

934
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:43,800
Calibur 2 was, like, this huge frickin' deal.

935
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:47,400
Soul Calibur 3, certainly if you're a fighting game fan, is still a huge deal, but this one's

936
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:51,240
kind of been seeming to fly under the radar for me, but it's still gonna look like a cool

937
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:52,240
game, nonetheless.

938
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:57,320
Maybe it's because, A, it doesn't have Link in it, and B, I know, but it wasn't the whole

939
00:54:57,320 --> 00:54:58,320
game.

940
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:00,080
I mean, the arcade version of Soul Calibur 2 is awesome.

941
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:02,120
Ivy is the whole game, really, is what it was.

942
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:04,700
The Xbox version of Soul Calibur 2 was awesome.

943
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:08,140
Anyway, Soul Calibur 3 is for the Playstation 2.

944
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:11,780
It's coming out October 25th, which I was kind of surprised, I was like, whoa, that

945
00:55:11,780 --> 00:55:13,200
was quick.

946
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:15,340
Also rated T for Teen, $49.99.

947
00:55:15,340 --> 00:55:20,780
Of course, the big thing about this is that you're going to be able to do some, create

948
00:55:20,780 --> 00:55:23,960
your own character, which I think will be very interesting.

949
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:24,960
So we'll see.

950
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:26,900
I definitely want to review this game on a later show.

951
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:31,980
Loki, take us out tonight with a story about Flash.

952
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:38,580
kind of a little promo thing. They have actually, as part of GameSpot, you can actually play

953
00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:42,540
the whole Prince of Persia via Flash on the Internet.

954
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:45,220
Like the old-ass Prince of Persia. We're not talking the sands of time.

955
00:55:45,220 --> 00:55:46,520
Yes. Wasn't there anything about the Prince of

956
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:53,640
Persia that was on like the NES, the Commodore 64, the Apple, the Game Boy? It was on like

957
00:55:53,640 --> 00:56:00,140
every system ever at that time. That's correct. You can find us at www.gamespot.com

958
00:56:00,140 --> 00:56:08,220
slash promo slash Prince of Persia dash game slash flash. That's it. Interesting.

959
00:56:08,220 --> 00:56:13,500
Slash partridge in a pear tree dot org. Check that out you guys. dot EU.

960
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:21,660
Alright, couple really quick things. PSP firmware 2.5 came out that allows the

961
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:25,780
movies on the go type thing where you can stream over the internet. Too bad that

962
00:56:25,780 --> 00:56:32,640
the peripheral that you need to use that is $350, so that sucks for everybody.

963
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:35,540
There's a brand new viral marketing campaign out.

964
00:56:35,540 --> 00:56:37,180
Oh God, one of those websites.

965
00:56:37,180 --> 00:56:38,840
Yep, that's right.

966
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:48,480
It's actually hex168, I believe is what it is, hex168.com, it's supposed to finish in

967
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:49,640
two days.

968
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:54,040
People are thinking it might be the announcement of World of Warcraft for the 360.

969
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:55,040
I doubt it.

970
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:56,040
about that.

971
00:56:56,040 --> 00:57:01,480
But anyways, that was just kind of interesting and the other thing is, and this is kind of

972
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:05,080
a disappointment to me, Elder Scrolls IV got pushed back to December.

973
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:06,960
Another launch game getting pushed back.

974
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:07,960
Go figure.

975
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:09,960
Couple weeks, but you know, December.

976
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:10,960
Still.

977
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:11,960
Still.

978
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:12,960
Still.

979
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:13,960
Yeah, so that's lame.

980
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:14,960
That's it.

981
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:15,960
That's going to do it.

982
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:16,960
That's the show, you guys.

983
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:17,960
Final thoughts.

984
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:18,960
Loki.

985
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:19,960
I need to play more games this week.

986
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:22,920
SSX on tour looks awesome, I can't wait.

987
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:26,960
My final thought is World of Warcraft, setting things on fire, full report next week.

988
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:29,000
Dark Sakura.

989
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,040
Reject pulse icons.

990
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:32,680
And that's all.

991
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:35,240
And one more thing, more fun stuff coming to the PSP site.

992
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:36,640
You had your last thought.

993
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:37,640
Alright.

994
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:42,440
Yes, check out the PSP site, OLRPSP.com, we haven't plugged that yet.

995
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:46,440
You know what though, we have barely heard from somebody this entire show.

996
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:47,800
Who's that?

997
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:50,520
Yes, our little pet ferret.

998
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:51,520
What are those things called?

999
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:52,520
Scoosies?

1000
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:53,520
Scott the Ferret.

1001
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:57,800
You know, in the little album art for our show, you see him, like really, really tiny.

1002
00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:01,360
I have just been sad and now I've been reunited with my Ferret friend.

1003
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:06,320
Alright, we're done, we're done, thanks for telling us, check us out next week, we'll

1004
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:08,240
be back as always.

1005
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:09,240
Have we ever missed a week?

1006
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:10,240
I don't know.

1007
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:13,240
I want a vacation, when do I get a vacation?

1008
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:14,720
You missed one show.

1009
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:15,720
One show.

1010
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:20,040
Alright, anyway, that's it, see you guys next time.

1011
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:23,800
That's the end of another Orange Lounge Radio To Go edition.

1012
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:27,680
This podcast is a proud part of www.orangeloungeradio.com.

1013
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:30,720
See you next update!
