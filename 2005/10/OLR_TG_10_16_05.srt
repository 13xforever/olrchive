00:00:30,471 --> 00:00:40,400
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, there's a whole lot of gaming podcasts out there now, so thank you guys especially for choosing us and sticking with us because I think if you go to the iTunes list of video game podcasts that are available, you get like a hundred.

8
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:41,321
[SPEAKER_06]: There's tons of them.

9
00:00:41,641 --> 00:00:43,022
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you guys for choosing us.

10
00:00:44,073 --> 00:00:44,293
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura

11
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:13,744
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Zul.

12
00:01:14,705 --> 00:01:16,666
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you the Keymaster?

13
00:01:17,006 --> 00:01:17,526
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, God.

14
00:01:17,706 --> 00:01:18,007
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

15
00:01:18,027 --> 00:01:18,667
[SPEAKER_05]: That was bad.

16
00:01:18,707 --> 00:01:18,987
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

17
00:01:19,007 --> 00:01:21,409
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the ferret.

18
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:23,010
[SPEAKER_05]: Also with us, Techmaster Loki.

19
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:23,970
[SPEAKER_05]: I am here.

20
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:24,691
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm me.

21
00:01:25,151 --> 00:01:26,752
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah.

22
00:01:26,852 --> 00:01:27,692
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't believe you.

23
00:01:28,113 --> 00:01:29,493
[SPEAKER_06]: You're not the gatekeeper or whatever?

24
00:01:29,533 --> 00:01:29,774
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

25
00:01:30,294 --> 00:01:30,834
[SPEAKER_06]: No gatekeeper.

26
00:01:30,854 --> 00:01:32,795
[SPEAKER_06]: That's good, because then you guys would have to have sex or something.

27
00:01:32,815 --> 00:01:33,416
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be nasty.

28
00:01:34,436 --> 00:01:34,957
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm married.

29
00:01:35,017 --> 00:01:35,377
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

30
00:01:35,457 --> 00:01:35,877
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you are.

31
00:01:37,018 --> 00:01:37,298
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

32
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,020
[SPEAKER_06]: GAMING WEEK

33
00:01:55,191 --> 00:01:56,891
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all about me, you know.

34
00:01:57,131 --> 00:01:58,072
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I know.

35
00:01:58,152 --> 00:01:59,412
[SPEAKER_01]: The diva of the show.

36
00:01:59,612 --> 00:02:01,752
[SPEAKER_06]: How was your gaming week, DarkSakura?

37
00:02:01,952 --> 00:02:06,573
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I was so busy all week, I haven't had much of a chance to play things, although I have put in effort.

38
00:02:07,053 --> 00:02:10,534
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a Dalmatian on that dog game.

39
00:02:10,554 --> 00:02:11,174
[SPEAKER_06]: Nintendogs?

40
00:02:11,414 --> 00:02:11,974
Yeah.

41
00:02:12,374 --> 00:02:13,014
[SPEAKER_06]: How quickly we forget.

42
00:02:13,034 --> 00:02:15,275
[SPEAKER_01]: After forgetting to feed my dogs for like two days.

43
00:02:16,395 --> 00:02:21,476
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a new dog that lives with my Corgiine and my Shiba Inu Minchi.

44
00:02:21,496 --> 00:02:21,876
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm.

45
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:23,821
[SPEAKER_01]: Dan also got me that Lawyer game.

46
00:02:49,082 --> 00:02:50,222
[SPEAKER_05]: Phoenix Wright, Ace Attorney.

47
00:02:50,242 --> 00:02:51,443
[SPEAKER_01]: Phoenix Wright, Ace Attorney.

48
00:02:51,843 --> 00:02:56,084
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's ironic that there's like a lawyer game and a doctor game out like right around the same time.

49
00:02:56,164 --> 00:02:57,404
[SPEAKER_06]: Doctor game's getting a sequel too.

50
00:02:57,424 --> 00:02:57,864
[SPEAKER_06]: Trauma Center.

51
00:02:58,024 --> 00:02:58,564
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my gosh.

52
00:02:58,904 --> 00:03:00,805
[SPEAKER_06]: I've heard Trauma Center is really difficult.

53
00:03:00,825 --> 00:03:03,445
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't gotten a chance to play it, but I hear Trauma Center is really, really difficult.

54
00:03:03,705 --> 00:03:07,026
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, unfortunately that brings me back to the game of Life and Death.

55
00:03:07,066 --> 00:03:09,907
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember that game back on the PC way long time ago?

56
00:03:09,967 --> 00:03:12,107
[SPEAKER_06]: I think about Operation, but sorry, DarkSakura.

57
00:03:12,127 --> 00:03:14,648
[SPEAKER_01]: Wouldn't Operation just be... Operation the MMO.

58
00:03:15,848 --> 00:03:16,008
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

59
00:03:16,468 --> 00:03:18,389
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, too many doctors ruin the operation.

60
00:03:19,556 --> 00:03:22,938
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I was going to play it and then Dan started to play it.

61
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:26,701
[SPEAKER_01]: He's still playing through Castlevania, that butt, so he needs to let me play the attorney game.

62
00:03:27,421 --> 00:03:28,462
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to solve cases.

63
00:03:29,462 --> 00:03:30,583
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm good at that kind of thing.

64
00:03:31,924 --> 00:03:34,766
[SPEAKER_01]: I also tried to play some Katamari, but I was too busy.

65
00:03:35,026 --> 00:03:37,327
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I screamed obscenities at Illustrator this morning.

66
00:03:38,508 --> 00:03:38,908
[SPEAKER_01]: Good times.

67
00:03:39,409 --> 00:03:42,330
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe you could check out an Illustrator podcast to help you out there.

68
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:44,832
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure there's got to be one out there somewhere.

69
00:03:44,972 --> 00:03:46,213
[SPEAKER_01]: We hate Adobe Hour.

70
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:52,295
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you to everybody that helped out with that, sending your donations in online.

71
00:04:09,233 --> 00:04:10,815
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

72
00:04:27,093 --> 00:04:31,616
[SPEAKER_01]: And then turn over the proceeds with our donations.

73
00:04:31,736 --> 00:04:37,659
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I actually donated my own copies of Polarium and Field of Magic, which I'm done with both of those games very much.

74
00:04:37,699 --> 00:04:40,460
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, because I remember how much you love Polarium.

75
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:41,701
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

76
00:04:41,721 --> 00:04:43,041
[SPEAKER_06]: There's worse DS games out there, though.

77
00:04:43,862 --> 00:04:47,584
[SPEAKER_06]: Check out my review of Sprung last week if you want to hear a bad deal.

78
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:48,964
[SPEAKER_01]: I still need Electroplankton.

79
00:04:48,984 --> 00:04:49,725
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm waiting for.

80
00:04:50,085 --> 00:04:50,865
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to check that out, too.

81
00:04:51,145 --> 00:04:52,526
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, how was your game of the week?

82
00:04:52,886 --> 00:04:53,667
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't play too much.

83
00:04:53,967 --> 00:04:56,048
[SPEAKER_05]: I did get to play a new game for the PSP.

84
00:04:56,658 --> 00:04:58,238
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

85
00:05:26,121 --> 00:05:26,721
[SPEAKER_05]: That's still fun.

86
00:05:27,102 --> 00:05:29,363
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't get boring at all.

87
00:05:29,944 --> 00:05:36,168
[SPEAKER_05]: The game I haven't been playing is Nintendogs because I'm tired of that game now and I'm not feeding my dog.

88
00:05:36,228 --> 00:05:37,949
[SPEAKER_05]: My dog floated to the top of the bowl.

89
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:42,512
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to bring Taco over so I can play with Taco before he runs away.

90
00:05:44,213 --> 00:05:44,534
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

91
00:05:45,882 --> 00:05:46,202
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it?

92
00:05:47,523 --> 00:05:48,404
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Burnout.

93
00:05:48,424 --> 00:05:49,124
[SPEAKER_05]: Burnout Revenge.

94
00:05:49,825 --> 00:05:50,405
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been playing that.

95
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:54,268
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to check out some different games this week.

96
00:05:54,308 --> 00:05:56,129
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got SSX on tour.

97
00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:00,272
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm anticipating Warriors, which is coming out this week.

98
00:06:00,772 --> 00:06:02,133
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll definitely be reviewing that.

99
00:06:03,534 --> 00:06:04,095
[SPEAKER_06]: My gaming week?

100
00:06:04,335 --> 00:06:06,637
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been playing Castlevania DS still.

101
00:06:06,817 --> 00:06:08,618
[SPEAKER_06]: I know I talked about it last week, but I love it.

102
00:06:08,798 --> 00:06:09,158
[SPEAKER_06]: I love it.

103
00:06:09,278 --> 00:06:09,819
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a great game.

104
00:06:09,999 --> 00:06:11,040
[SPEAKER_06]: So I've been playing a lot more of that.

105
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:14,302
[SPEAKER_06]: And honestly, not a whole lot of new stuff until today.

106
00:06:15,356 --> 00:06:16,437
[SPEAKER_06]: The Day We Were Recording This Show

107
00:06:37,379 --> 00:06:39,320
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think I finally narrowed it down to a couple.

108
00:06:39,961 --> 00:06:43,163
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know DarkSakura and I will both be playing on one of those servers together.

109
00:06:43,183 --> 00:06:43,623
[SPEAKER_06]: So it'll be cool.

110
00:06:44,063 --> 00:06:45,464
[SPEAKER_01]: It will be on Scarlet Crusade.

111
00:06:45,524 --> 00:06:45,685
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

112
00:06:45,785 --> 00:06:46,725
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're both playing Alliance.

113
00:06:46,745 --> 00:06:47,686
[SPEAKER_06]: Please don't cyber-stalk us.

114
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:48,326
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

115
00:06:48,927 --> 00:06:51,168
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm not saying who our characters are or what.

116
00:06:51,188 --> 00:06:53,049
[SPEAKER_06]: Because they won't be named after ourselves.

117
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:55,371
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you want to cyber-stalk us, send us an email.

118
00:06:55,391 --> 00:06:55,751
[SPEAKER_06]: You never know.

119
00:06:56,752 --> 00:06:59,593
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody sent me an email that says, hey, I want to add you to Xbox Live.

120
00:06:59,654 --> 00:07:01,114
[SPEAKER_06]: And I said, okay, why not?

121
00:07:01,195 --> 00:07:02,295
[SPEAKER_06]: And then they kicked my ass in Halo.

122
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:05,537
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm wondering if they're doing new gamer tags for Xbox Live for the 360.

123
00:07:05,597 --> 00:07:05,697
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

124
00:07:07,028 --> 00:07:12,130
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm curious about that too, because I want to try and get Sky, just Sky, but... Same.

125
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:22,714
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think I'll be able to do it, but I will be willing to, you know, get on Xbox Live right when I get the game, so... Because I don't have just plain old Sky on regular Xbox right now.

126
00:07:22,954 --> 00:07:23,554
[SPEAKER_06]: I have something else.

127
00:07:23,895 --> 00:07:24,715
[SPEAKER_06]: Otherwise I got backup.

128
00:07:26,167 --> 00:07:26,968
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

129
00:07:45,886 --> 00:08:09,166
[SPEAKER_06]: but I'm playing a warlock but I'm only like level 3 right now but I thought it was pretty badass because I actually got a spell where you can set something on fire and that was cool like actually setting it on fire I have not left Final Fantasy XI I'm just going to try and balance the two games I'm going to balance the two games for a little while there's things about Final Fantasy XI that were really starting to get to me so I want to play World of Warcraft no there's things I like about Final Fantasy XI there's things I dislike about Final Fantasy XI I really need to sit down and

130
00:08:09,778 --> 00:08:35,395
[SPEAKER_05]: Dedicate time to play the game I haven't played in months And I really, I don't want to give it up I still want to play the game But I need to dedicate a day or something In which the fiancé will not interfere with the game And I get to play I need to give WoW a fair shot Because honestly, I owe it to our listeners To give an unbiased perspective of what's going on in WoW Let's give away some crap You can send me a letter We'll see

131
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:37,190
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's give away some crap.

132
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:39,291
[SPEAKER_06]: Last week we promised we would give away some crap.

[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to give away a copy of Death Junior and pull a number out of the hat there, DarkSakura.

00:09:35,876 --> 00:09:38,217
[SPEAKER_06]: and Otakuland is how their name comes up.

152
00:09:38,257 --> 00:09:41,778
[SPEAKER_01]: Otakuland is one of our also regular writers to our 2GoBox.

153
00:09:41,899 --> 00:09:42,319
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, really?

154
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:43,439
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, good deal.

155
00:09:44,059 --> 00:09:46,761
[SPEAKER_06]: Otakuland won a copy of Coded Arms for the PSP, so there you have it.

156
00:09:46,781 --> 00:09:57,585
[SPEAKER_05]: Just remember, folks, if you do have PSPs that are version 1.5 and you're going to be playing these games, I think Coded Arms does have a 2.0 update on it, so you want to go get that version changer, which is available on PSP Updates.

157
00:09:58,929 --> 00:10:26,868
[SPEAKER_01]: I also would like to mention that Otakuland has actually been very helpful to me by suggesting there's a site called GameTZ just G-A-M-E-T-Z dot com that has people who deal in import games trading import games and someone on there has Panorama Cotton they want 500 freaking dollars for it and I said no but they do trade in the rare that would be a great Christmas present

158
00:10:28,485 --> 00:10:34,589
[SPEAKER_01]: If some dear listener wants to spend $500 on little old me, I ain't stopping you.

159
00:10:34,609 --> 00:10:35,629
[SPEAKER_06]: You're a sucker, for one.

160
00:10:35,649 --> 00:10:36,770
[SPEAKER_01]: I ain't stopping you.

161
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:38,611
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, well, congratulations to our two winners there.

162
00:10:38,651 --> 00:10:41,233
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad some people that are involved in the show could win those.

163
00:10:41,313 --> 00:10:42,053
[SPEAKER_06]: So good job, guys.

164
00:10:42,353 --> 00:10:43,754
[SPEAKER_06]: We will do another giveaway very soon.

165
00:10:43,814 --> 00:10:44,474
[SPEAKER_06]: Tune in next week.

166
00:10:44,935 --> 00:10:45,875
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe we'll have something next week.

167
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,496
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, do we have anything in the prize vault for next week?

168
00:10:47,576 --> 00:10:47,876
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we know?

169
00:10:48,096 --> 00:10:52,619
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got an assortment of anime soundtracks, like a ton of them.

170
00:10:53,239 --> 00:10:54,180
[SPEAKER_05]: So, possibly.

171
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:56,341
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, well, we'll just have to give a whole lot of those away, so...

172
00:10:57,415 --> 00:10:58,375
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

173
00:11:25,043 --> 00:11:26,004
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

174
00:11:50,114 --> 00:11:50,955
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for watching!

175
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:08,461
[SPEAKER_01]: and also comparing it to what the current laws are.

176
00:12:10,341 --> 00:12:13,222
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, there's one in particular that is actually the first one used.

177
00:12:14,943 --> 00:12:28,646
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, the person who wrote this article did a comparison by showing the law about the sale of alcohol to minors compared with the law regarding the game sale.

178
00:12:29,338 --> 00:12:38,023
[SPEAKER_01]: And the game sale one reads as this, except as otherwise provided in subdivision C, every person who sells, furnishes, gives, or causes to be sold, furnished, or given away.

179
00:12:38,543 --> 00:12:40,584
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, actually, that's the alcoholic beverage one.

180
00:12:42,885 --> 00:12:47,928
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, are given away any alcoholic beverage to any person under the age of 21 years is guilty of a misdemeanor.

181
00:12:48,508 --> 00:12:58,096
[SPEAKER_01]: Any person under the age of 21 who purchases any alcoholic beverage or any person under the age of 21 who consumes any alcoholic beverage in any on-sale premises is guilty of a misdemeanor.

182
00:12:59,217 --> 00:13:04,220
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, compared to the violent game law, I'll just read a little bit of part of it.

183
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:16,830
[SPEAKER_01]: Violent video game means a video game in which the range of options available to a player includes killing, maiming, dismembering, or sexually assaulting the image of a human being if those acts are depicted in the game in a manner that does either the fault.

184
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:17,491
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes into...

185
00:13:21,265 --> 00:13:22,546
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole outline of it.

186
00:13:28,032 --> 00:13:38,942
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of what it's going into as far as trying to define is that it's going on the assumption that it's depicting a violent act on a person.

187
00:13:39,602 --> 00:13:42,385
[SPEAKER_01]: Thing is, is that they're not people.

188
00:13:43,265 --> 00:13:44,966
[SPEAKER_01]: and their video game images.

189
00:13:45,186 --> 00:13:52,248
[SPEAKER_06]: Without rehashing this whole same argument over and over again though because it seems like we've had something about violent video games like every week on this program for the last three months.

190
00:13:52,268 --> 00:13:54,149
[SPEAKER_01]: The point is it's not a clear law.

191
00:13:54,689 --> 00:13:56,950
[SPEAKER_06]: Who makes that definition?

192
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:57,830
[SPEAKER_06]: What is violent?

193
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:00,051
[SPEAKER_06]: Who makes that definition and who's checking on them?

194
00:14:00,071 --> 00:14:02,032
[SPEAKER_06]: Because we've got a system of checks and balances in this country.

195
00:14:02,332 --> 00:14:04,573
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's checking on the people that are making these calls?

196
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:05,253
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I want to know.

197
00:14:05,433 --> 00:14:09,334
[SPEAKER_01]: And the whole point it makes here is how clear the sale of alcohol law is.

198
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:10,975
[SPEAKER_01]: In comparison to this

199
00:14:11,485 --> 00:14:12,787
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

200
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:29,788
[SPEAKER_01]: When the same something does not exist.

201
00:14:30,329 --> 00:14:34,733
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't necessarily disagree with trying to control the sale of games.

202
00:14:35,213 --> 00:14:40,137
[SPEAKER_06]: Just like you would say that an under 17 person shouldn't buy an R-rated DVD.

203
00:14:40,558 --> 00:14:47,684
[SPEAKER_06]: But my whole thing is that the bill is so vague that it seems like it's just prepared to be there to...

204
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:51,987
[SPEAKER_06]: Target things when they come out like Grand Theft Auto.

205
00:14:52,067 --> 00:14:58,929
[SPEAKER_06]: It's built so that when somebody kills somebody and blames Grand Theft Auto, that's when people are going to panic and say, who sold them the game?

206
00:14:59,009 --> 00:14:59,410
[SPEAKER_06]: Find them.

207
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:00,370
[SPEAKER_06]: Invoke the law.

208
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:04,891
[SPEAKER_06]: But my question is, no, no, before that all happens, who is making the determination what is a value?

209
00:15:04,911 --> 00:15:05,892
[SPEAKER_06]: That's my biggest problem with the law.

210
00:15:06,032 --> 00:15:07,352
[SPEAKER_06]: Otherwise, whatever.

211
00:15:07,472 --> 00:15:10,253
[SPEAKER_06]: I suppose they have to do what they have to do, and I'm okay with them.

212
00:15:10,713 --> 00:15:12,454
[SPEAKER_06]: I was all for ratings.

213
00:15:13,075 --> 00:15:17,317
[SPEAKER_01]: because ratings puts the power in the hands of those who should possess it, the parents.

214
00:15:17,377 --> 00:15:19,918
[SPEAKER_06]: Why not have the bill just adopt the ratings that are in place right now?

215
00:15:19,938 --> 00:15:20,719
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what this is?

216
00:15:20,839 --> 00:15:26,001
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basically legalizing censorship as far as... In a way, in a way.

217
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:29,037
[SPEAKER_01]: It's limiting free expression.

218
00:15:29,738 --> 00:15:32,299
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not stopping the games from being made, no.

219
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,041
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's putting the scarlet letter on them.

220
00:15:35,321 --> 00:15:36,782
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's exactly it.

221
00:15:36,862 --> 00:15:39,243
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great comparison right there.

222
00:15:39,743 --> 00:15:51,751
[SPEAKER_06]: But let's face it, in some of our demographic, I know for me, the games that have the scarlet letter on them, or should I say the scarlet number, I'm going to be more attracted to and go, ooh, do I get to see some titties in this one?

223
00:15:52,131 --> 00:15:52,651
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

224
00:15:52,751 --> 00:15:54,212
[SPEAKER_05]: I want more titties in my games if

225
00:15:54,758 --> 00:15:56,922
[SPEAKER_05]: No, they're going to be preventing kids from buying them.

226
00:15:57,202 --> 00:15:59,527
[SPEAKER_05]: That means, Rockstar, the gloves are off.

227
00:16:00,048 --> 00:16:01,150
[SPEAKER_05]: Do whatever the fuck you want.

228
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:02,974
[SPEAKER_05]: Just release the games.

229
00:16:03,775 --> 00:16:04,737
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, alright.

230
00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:06,461
[SPEAKER_01]: I think...

231
00:16:08,911 --> 00:16:17,633
[SPEAKER_01]: I look at this as the government basically trying to take the power from the people, trying to take the responsibility out of the people's hands.

232
00:16:18,674 --> 00:16:29,777
[SPEAKER_01]: I do admit, the game companies do have a duty of responsibility to the consumer to make sure that the product that they put on the market is exactly what they say they're selling.

233
00:16:29,877 --> 00:16:30,237
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

234
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:36,053
[SPEAKER_06]: To rate the game appropriately and market the game towards the appropriate audience.

235
00:16:36,314 --> 00:16:46,339
[SPEAKER_01]: To compare, when I was studying business law, they brought up a case about a woman who was suing over having pieces of clamshell in her clam chowder.

236
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:47,620
[SPEAKER_01]: And she broke a tooth.

237
00:16:48,061 --> 00:16:48,641
[SPEAKER_01]: So she sued.

238
00:16:50,022 --> 00:16:57,886
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing is, is that there is an expectation that there may be clamshell in the game.

239
00:16:58,347 --> 00:17:00,528
[SPEAKER_01]: She lost, not in the game, but in the soup.

240
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:03,301
[SPEAKER_06]: Warning, this game may contain clam parts.

241
00:17:03,921 --> 00:17:15,244
[SPEAKER_01]: But she lost the case because under the rights and responsibility for, say, food handling, having bits and pieces in that, chicken soup, you know, or buy fish fillet.

242
00:17:15,324 --> 00:17:17,125
[SPEAKER_01]: You may have a fish bone in your fish fillet.

243
00:17:17,685 --> 00:17:29,228
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, to compare, when you buy a game that is rated M, you should expect that there's going to be mature themes in the game.

244
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,341
[SPEAKER_01]: You may see some boobies.

245
00:17:32,222 --> 00:17:33,663
[SPEAKER_01]: You may hear the F word.

246
00:17:35,185 --> 00:17:37,467
[SPEAKER_01]: Regardless, you have been warned.

247
00:17:38,528 --> 00:17:42,671
[SPEAKER_01]: By that little N being on the bottom of the game, you have been warned.

248
00:17:43,512 --> 00:17:47,215
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I do think that Rockstar was lax.

249
00:17:47,536 --> 00:17:50,478
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, and even so, I can't really fault this either.

250
00:17:51,079 --> 00:17:53,401
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, removing the code, bracketing it out.

251
00:17:55,163 --> 00:17:56,263
[SPEAKER_01]: That's done all the time.

252
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:57,744
[SPEAKER_06]: Aren't we feeling a little blue in the face here?

253
00:17:58,144 --> 00:17:58,484
[SPEAKER_01]: I am.

254
00:17:59,305 --> 00:18:03,666
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, honestly, there is and is not fault in that.

255
00:18:03,746 --> 00:18:05,767
[SPEAKER_01]: Technically, they did remove access to it.

256
00:18:06,187 --> 00:18:08,688
[SPEAKER_01]: It just happened to be somebody out there who's curious enough to find it.

257
00:18:09,042 --> 00:18:09,982
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, no easy answer.

258
00:18:10,002 --> 00:18:12,583
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, we welcome your feedback, as always, to go at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.

259
00:18:12,604 --> 00:18:14,044
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm tired of talking about this subject.

260
00:18:14,344 --> 00:18:15,605
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, then let's get to a new one.

261
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:21,327
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's talk about, ooh, Digital Life happened this weekend, which was that big expo in New York, which I really wanted to go to, but I couldn't.

262
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,548
[SPEAKER_06]: But I heard it was very crowded.

263
00:18:22,588 --> 00:18:29,911
[SPEAKER_06]: We had some folks call in on our live show Sunday nights that were at Digital Life, saying that just crowded amongst crowded, just really, really crowded stuff.

264
00:18:30,751 --> 00:18:32,612
[SPEAKER_06]: A few folks got to check out some new games, though.

265
00:18:33,432 --> 00:18:37,716
[SPEAKER_06]: One thing that did happen was that the Xbox Live Arcade lineup was announced.

266
00:18:37,796 --> 00:18:42,440
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, Loki, I know you talked about this a little bit last week because you had some photos of some of the games in development.

267
00:18:42,721 --> 00:18:45,023
[SPEAKER_06]: But they did kind of officially say what's going to be in it.

268
00:18:45,383 --> 00:18:48,045
[SPEAKER_06]: What I think is interesting, a whole lot of PopCap games showing up.

269
00:18:48,266 --> 00:18:51,689
[SPEAKER_06]: Astro Pop, Bejeweled 2, Zuma going to be in there.

270
00:18:52,329 --> 00:18:53,390
[SPEAKER_06]: Some other games in there as well.

271
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:55,432
[SPEAKER_06]: Gauntlet, Joust.

272
00:18:56,038 --> 00:19:06,942
[SPEAKER_06]: and then of course the Marble Blaster talking about Robotron and Smash TV which is kind of interesting to me that they would put these in the arcade when you can just buy the Midway Arcade Treasures Collection which would be a much better deal I think for some of those games.

273
00:19:07,042 --> 00:19:08,122
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember, don't shoot the food.

274
00:19:08,462 --> 00:19:08,842
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I know.

275
00:19:09,843 --> 00:19:13,324
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not the complete list but those are the only games that sound very familiar to me.

276
00:19:14,304 --> 00:19:18,886
[SPEAKER_06]: So check that out if you're curious on your Xbox 360 when you get that.

277
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:20,646
[SPEAKER_06]: Also on the Xbox 360...

278
00:19:23,939 --> 00:19:24,579
[SPEAKER_06]: This is interesting.

279
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:25,619
[SPEAKER_06]: They're doing this in Japan.

280
00:19:25,639 --> 00:19:29,060
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to be doing a beta test of Final Fantasy XI on the brand new Xbox 360.

281
00:19:30,061 --> 00:19:43,264
[SPEAKER_06]: The console launches in Japan on December 10th, and if you purchase the limited edition Xbox 360 package, you're going to get a free Final Fantasy XI beta test disc while supplies last.

282
00:19:44,022 --> 00:19:47,644
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, you have a story about the 360 as well and some kind of bad news about the dev kits.

283
00:19:47,704 --> 00:19:47,804
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

284
00:19:47,824 --> 00:19:49,124
[SPEAKER_01]: We did cover about the theft of the 360 dev kit

285
00:20:14,056 --> 00:20:18,462
[SPEAKER_06]: I think so, but if we didn't, I'm sure people read about it or heard about it on another cast or something.

286
00:20:18,502 --> 00:20:19,924
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, some dev kits were stolen.

287
00:20:21,385 --> 00:20:30,497
[SPEAKER_01]: At any rate, a Dutch newspaper reported that Microsoft is preparing a $100 million lawsuit against those responsible for the theft.

288
00:20:33,616 --> 00:20:40,299
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they're wanting to protect the security so that you can't hack the Xbox 360.

289
00:20:40,599 --> 00:20:44,361
[SPEAKER_01]: Which you know is a big problem with the Xbox here is that they pretty much broke it right away.

290
00:20:45,101 --> 00:20:50,243
[SPEAKER_01]: And we started having a meme on the Xbox and extra huge hard drives.

291
00:20:50,543 --> 00:20:51,423
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, why are you laughing?

292
00:20:51,684 --> 00:20:57,266
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm laughing because the way they set up the whole hard drive situation anyways is just asking to be hacked.

293
00:20:57,765 --> 00:20:58,266
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

294
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:25,255
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also an interesting statement on here, though, from the hacking group who's, I guess, responsible.

295
00:21:25,896 --> 00:21:29,980
[SPEAKER_01]: It's from, I hope I'm saying this wrong, it's smartxx.com.

296
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,122
[SPEAKER_06]: You hope you're saying that wrong?

297
00:21:32,783 --> 00:21:34,065
[SPEAKER_06]: He said, I hope I'm saying that wrong.

298
00:21:34,645 --> 00:21:36,207
[SPEAKER_06]: I said, I hope I'm not saying that wrong.

299
00:21:36,227 --> 00:21:36,768
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, my bad.

300
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:39,371
[SPEAKER_01]: I threw a ferret at you.

301
00:21:39,391 --> 00:21:41,553
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, anyway.

302
00:21:42,931 --> 00:22:09,851
[SPEAKER_01]: but they're saying the website the pictures of the stolen dev kits emerged claiming Microsoft was actually complicit in the group's acquisition of the kits they went on to say I'm going to just quote this here according to the poster people within Microsoft unaware of the operation went on to inform the police that they should investigate SmartXX leading to the current situation and that Microsoft was going to deny it as usual

303
00:22:11,477 --> 00:22:12,340
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought that was very interesting.

304
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,964
[SPEAKER_06]: That was interesting.

305
00:22:14,085 --> 00:22:16,491
[SPEAKER_06]: Speaking of people getting busted...

306
00:22:17,771 --> 00:22:20,792
[SPEAKER_06]: A Game Pirate in Richmond, Texas.

307
00:22:21,192 --> 00:22:22,152
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess we should say in a legend.

308
00:22:22,212 --> 00:22:31,015
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I guess not a legend anymore because this guy was sentenced to three years and ten months in a federal prison and a fine of $1.15 million.

309
00:22:32,235 --> 00:22:36,216
[SPEAKER_06]: That's Dashiel Ponce de Leon receiving this sentence there.

310
00:22:36,536 --> 00:22:41,798
[SPEAKER_06]: That $1.15 million representing the retail value of all the software this guy sold.

311
00:22:42,138 --> 00:22:44,319
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, this guy wasn't doing the thing on BitTorrent or anything.

312
00:22:44,339 --> 00:22:45,059
[SPEAKER_06]: This guy was actually...

313
00:22:45,399 --> 00:22:48,361
[SPEAKER_06]: Downloading stuff online then reselling it through the internet.

314
00:22:48,421 --> 00:22:50,162
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the worst kind of piracy right there.

315
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:52,824
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the kind that a lot of people say even they want to.

316
00:22:52,844 --> 00:22:54,545
[SPEAKER_05]: That hurts the pockets of the developers.

317
00:22:55,346 --> 00:22:57,107
[SPEAKER_05]: And just downloading off BitTorrent doesn't?

318
00:22:58,367 --> 00:22:59,788
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, stop making crappy games.

319
00:22:59,848 --> 00:23:03,631
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one person as opposed to one person multiplying the efforts.

320
00:23:04,306 --> 00:23:05,007
[SPEAKER_05]: I buy games.

321
00:23:05,328 --> 00:23:06,109
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at my collection.

322
00:23:06,169 --> 00:23:08,732
[SPEAKER_05]: I have tons of games that I pay money for.

323
00:23:08,812 --> 00:23:13,919
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that anyone who lives in my house cannot say that I don't buy a lot of games.

324
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:16,002
[SPEAKER_05]: I just don't want to buy an import system, so...

325
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:18,811
[SPEAKER_06]: I am so sick of this loser.

326
00:23:44,452 --> 00:23:46,914
[SPEAKER_05]: He needs to team up with that guy from the 700 Club.

327
00:23:47,054 --> 00:23:47,555
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, I know.

328
00:23:47,595 --> 00:23:51,658
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway, this is the guy who was saying, video games are evil.

329
00:23:51,758 --> 00:23:58,184
[SPEAKER_01]: And people refute him with backing up everything with solid evidence, and then he goes, well, you're just a pissant.

330
00:23:58,564 --> 00:24:06,231
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I thought this was interesting, is that earlier this week you might have heard the National Institute on Media and the Family, NIMF,

331
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:15,778
[SPEAKER_06]: The President David Walsh kind of wrote a letter that kind of distanced himself from Jack Thompson and said, I really wish you'd stop using our name in your arguments and stuff.

332
00:24:16,398 --> 00:24:18,600
[SPEAKER_06]: A quote from the letter here.

333
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:22,643
[SPEAKER_06]: Your commentary has included extreme hyperbole and your... Hyperbole.

334
00:24:22,663 --> 00:24:23,204
[SPEAKER_06]: Hyperbole.

335
00:24:23,704 --> 00:24:24,585
[SPEAKER_06]: I was correcting myself.

336
00:24:24,985 --> 00:24:25,466
[SPEAKER_06]: Hyperbole.

337
00:24:25,486 --> 00:24:30,210
[SPEAKER_06]: And your tactics have included personally attacking individuals for whom I have a great deal of respect.

338
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:31,671
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought that was very interesting.

339
00:24:31,691 --> 00:24:32,311
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, get this.

340
00:24:33,032 --> 00:24:34,533
[SPEAKER_06]: Dr. Thompson fought back.

341
00:24:35,214 --> 00:24:35,534
[SPEAKER_06]: Doctor?

342
00:24:36,719 --> 00:24:38,442
[SPEAKER_06]: I think he, is he a doctor?

343
00:24:39,243 --> 00:24:41,866
[SPEAKER_06]: He's a doctor of... No, he's not a doctor.

344
00:24:42,126 --> 00:24:45,591
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a doctor of things he can't say on the air.

345
00:24:45,671 --> 00:24:48,655
[SPEAKER_06]: I kind of fused two words together there.

346
00:24:49,231 --> 00:24:57,814
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, no, what he did there is that he actually kind of denied, saying, the fact is, I have never suggested that Dr. Walsh approves of what I do.

347
00:24:58,194 --> 00:25:01,956
[SPEAKER_06]: I have countless times told people that I believe he is an expert around the dangers of video games.

348
00:25:02,236 --> 00:25:14,720
[SPEAKER_06]: The mistake I made, apparently, naively, is thinking that a person of his expertise would use it actually to help some bereaved families rather than choose to protect his relationship with portions of the video game industry and its reckless retail network.

349
00:25:16,331 --> 00:25:22,296
[SPEAKER_06]: and then he goes on to say, I'm a Christian and I think Dr. Walsh is as well and there's a passage in the New Testament.

350
00:25:22,316 --> 00:25:24,197
[SPEAKER_06]: What does that have to do with anything?

351
00:25:24,217 --> 00:25:27,040
[SPEAKER_01]: Thou shall not play violent video games.

352
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:33,465
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really wondering why people keep bringing up Christianity as an illustration of morality.

353
00:25:34,826 --> 00:25:36,827
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a whole other topic for a whole other cast.

354
00:25:36,907 --> 00:25:37,768
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, I know.

355
00:25:37,788 --> 00:25:38,629
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to go into it.

356
00:25:38,749 --> 00:25:43,453
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just I find it highly hilarious how he's defending himself saying, oh, but I'm a Christian.

357
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:44,994
[SPEAKER_01]: Yet he's going around saying,

358
00:25:45,527 --> 00:25:47,668
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically slandering innocent people.

359
00:25:48,709 --> 00:25:56,892
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like I said before, when people are presenting him with evidence that proves him wrong, he's going back and calling them names.

360
00:25:57,273 --> 00:26:02,015
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't want to get into religious debate, but from what I understand about Christianity, there's only one judge.

361
00:26:03,616 --> 00:26:05,256
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, he's going to have to answer to it.

362
00:26:05,276 --> 00:26:06,697
[SPEAKER_06]: There's only one judge.

363
00:26:06,777 --> 00:26:07,637
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's not Wapner.

364
00:26:09,278 --> 00:26:09,598
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

365
00:26:09,698 --> 00:26:10,819
[SPEAKER_01]: Judge Wapner, guy.

366
00:26:11,179 --> 00:26:12,660
[SPEAKER_06]: No, he's doing the pet court or something.

367
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:12,940
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh.

368
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:14,195
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura.com

369
00:26:43,459 --> 00:26:45,300
[SPEAKER_01]: Jack Thompson compared this guy to Hitler.

370
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:48,802
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's one of the people that this group associates with.

371
00:26:48,822 --> 00:26:55,205
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the things I was going to mention is remember last week we were talking about how he was proposing that game companies create his game.

372
00:26:55,926 --> 00:26:56,166
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways.

373
00:26:56,539 --> 00:27:01,981
[SPEAKER_05]: So then Penny Arcade, of course, said he would pay $10,000 if his game was created.

374
00:27:02,001 --> 00:27:06,842
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they're like, well, that's kind of weak because we donated half a million dollars for this charity.

375
00:27:07,582 --> 00:27:08,102
[SPEAKER_05]: So what did he do?

376
00:27:08,462 --> 00:27:14,744
[SPEAKER_05]: He found their phone number and their signature that was in their email and yelled at them, literally.

377
00:27:14,944 --> 00:27:16,725
[SPEAKER_05]: Called them up and yelled.

378
00:27:16,765 --> 00:27:17,045
[SPEAKER_05]: Yelled.

379
00:27:18,581 --> 00:27:19,182
[SPEAKER_05]: That was pretty lame.

380
00:27:19,682 --> 00:27:21,823
[SPEAKER_01]: This guy is obviously mentally unstable.

381
00:27:22,004 --> 00:27:31,890
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, obviously, this guy is becoming kind of like the laughingstock of the video game community, so now you're seeing him in all sorts of mods, and what did you find?

382
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:38,194
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's the Jack Thompson murder simulator called Defamation of Character.

383
00:27:39,114 --> 00:27:46,519
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's basically a mod for Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, and you can find this at hellfish...

384
00:27:47,632 --> 00:27:50,615
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a guy you compared to Hitler.

385
00:28:02,915 --> 00:28:06,576
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, and basically they kind of go through what you can do.

386
00:28:07,376 --> 00:28:20,100
[SPEAKER_05]: He is Jack Thompson, who also is his alter ego, Bandman, who they actually have dressed up in some weird box and just some funny stuff.

387
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:29,382
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyways, you go through a bunch of different missions, including murdering, I believe it was two live crew.

388
00:28:31,476 --> 00:28:33,177
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think they're going to like that very much.

389
00:28:33,517 --> 00:28:40,818
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you're murdering two left crew who they have a picture on the website hanging, looks like upside down, dead from his ceiling.

390
00:28:41,078 --> 00:28:44,879
[SPEAKER_01]: He was actually also the one responsible for the whole cop killer thing with Ice-T.

391
00:28:44,919 --> 00:28:46,099
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of you guys have a lot of free time.

392
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:46,939
[SPEAKER_06]: I know it's out there.

393
00:28:46,959 --> 00:28:48,760
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of you gamers have a lot of free time.

394
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,520
[SPEAKER_05]: But I thought here's what was funny, though.

395
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:56,421
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the special abilities he had, he can do, of course, bullet time like every other game.

396
00:28:56,684 --> 00:29:02,108
[SPEAKER_05]: He has legal immunity, basically when the police are coming or whatever, you can instantly get them to go away.

397
00:29:03,388 --> 00:29:08,092
[SPEAKER_05]: He has the Holy Escort, which is this Harrier jet that makes him invincible or something.

398
00:29:08,712 --> 00:29:16,177
[SPEAKER_05]: And Press Relations, which you can basically just pull a publicity stunt and get everyone to forget about stuff.

399
00:29:16,465 --> 00:29:16,845
[SPEAKER_06]: Beautiful.

400
00:29:17,366 --> 00:29:17,966
[SPEAKER_06]: Beautiful, beautiful.

401
00:29:18,026 --> 00:29:18,306
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

402
00:29:18,607 --> 00:29:18,887
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

403
00:29:19,047 --> 00:29:21,089
[SPEAKER_06]: I need some real morality here on this show.

404
00:29:21,189 --> 00:29:22,310
[SPEAKER_06]: I need some real morality.

405
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:26,873
[SPEAKER_06]: And I turned to DarkSakura to bring that morality to this program.

406
00:29:27,514 --> 00:29:30,376
[SPEAKER_06]: And she provides that for us every week with her weekly advice column.

407
00:29:30,716 --> 00:29:32,758
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, you know, there is more to life than just gaming.

408
00:29:33,098 --> 00:29:38,322
[SPEAKER_06]: Because if you played video games all day long, you would have no time to watch the people's court.

409
00:29:38,923 --> 00:29:39,283
[SPEAKER_06]: You wouldn't.

410
00:29:40,245 --> 00:29:41,305
[SPEAKER_06]: Judge Wapner was cool.

411
00:29:41,486 --> 00:29:41,706
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

412
00:29:41,786 --> 00:29:43,366
[SPEAKER_06]: Even that new lady that's on it is pretty awesome.

413
00:29:43,546 --> 00:29:44,006
[SPEAKER_06]: She's pretty awesome.

414
00:29:44,026 --> 00:29:44,827
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't watch TV.

415
00:29:45,267 --> 00:29:45,467
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

416
00:29:45,887 --> 00:29:48,168
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, so DarkSakura, what are you going to be telling the kids about tonight?

417
00:29:50,209 --> 00:29:56,611
[SPEAKER_01]: Today's bit of advice is excuses you can make for falling asleep at your desk at work and then how to fake being asleep at work.

418
00:29:56,991 --> 00:29:57,332
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

419
00:29:57,712 --> 00:29:58,212
[SPEAKER_06]: I need this.

420
00:29:58,312 --> 00:29:58,932
[SPEAKER_06]: I need to know this.

421
00:29:59,853 --> 00:30:02,394
[SPEAKER_01]: To be asleep at your desk, first of all, blame work.

422
00:30:02,874 --> 00:30:06,015
[SPEAKER_01]: Say, I'm so exhausted I was here until midnight last night.

423
00:30:06,395 --> 00:30:08,676
[SPEAKER_01]: Do not attempt this if your boss works late and you do not.

424
00:30:09,616 --> 00:30:13,397
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I had a fellow co-worker actually say that to me the other day.

425
00:30:14,617 --> 00:30:16,097
[SPEAKER_06]: I wonder if that was something they were doing.

426
00:30:16,477 --> 00:30:18,698
[SPEAKER_01]: Number two, blame medication.

427
00:30:19,098 --> 00:30:21,858
[SPEAKER_01]: Claim that your new allergy medicine has been making you drowsy.

428
00:30:22,018 --> 00:30:24,119
[SPEAKER_01]: Say, those antihistamines just knock me out.

429
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:26,299
[SPEAKER_01]: It usually works for me because I take Benadryl.

430
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:29,019
[SPEAKER_01]: Number three, blame lunch.

431
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,460
[SPEAKER_01]: Say, wow, I guess I should not have eaten that turkey sandwich.

432
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:36,641
[SPEAKER_01]: Tryptophan always makes me sleepy, which is true.

433
00:30:36,761 --> 00:30:37,381
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a sedative.

434
00:30:37,421 --> 00:30:37,721
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm-hmm.

435
00:30:38,591 --> 00:30:40,272
[SPEAKER_01]: Be aware when taking a nap.

436
00:30:40,452 --> 00:30:44,215
[SPEAKER_01]: Always rest your elbow on your desk and keep your arm perpendicular to the desktop.

437
00:30:44,755 --> 00:30:46,737
[SPEAKER_01]: Your forehead should rest on your four fingers.

438
00:30:46,977 --> 00:30:50,299
[SPEAKER_01]: Your thumb, spread apart from the fingers, should support your jaw.

439
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,281
[SPEAKER_01]: This position will keep your head up and aimed at your desk.

440
00:30:54,082 --> 00:30:59,305
[SPEAKER_01]: Face in a direction so that it is not immediately visible to someone approaching your desk that your eyes are closed.

441
00:31:00,066 --> 00:31:05,289
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep an important group of documents in your perceived line of sight so as to appear to be reading intently.

442
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:07,771
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this also worked in high school.

443
00:31:09,483 --> 00:31:16,085
[SPEAKER_01]: My final piece of advice, do not stay up all night playing Final Fantasy XI, you freaking addicts.

444
00:31:17,145 --> 00:31:21,786
[SPEAKER_06]: Or World of Warcraft, or Ragnarok, or whatever the kids are playing these days.

445
00:31:22,566 --> 00:31:24,647
[SPEAKER_01]: I never let that get in the way of my sleep.

446
00:31:26,647 --> 00:31:30,468
[SPEAKER_01]: Except when I was unemployed and had no excuse to go to bed.

447
00:31:31,118 --> 00:31:33,799
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got some music game news for you guys tonight.

448
00:31:33,819 --> 00:31:37,180
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, you know, Orange Lounge, we were all about the music games when we started.

449
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,860
[SPEAKER_06]: We still are to some extent, but we talk about other video games too.

450
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,841
[SPEAKER_06]: But this is some big music game news.

451
00:31:42,221 --> 00:31:43,581
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got Guitar Hero.

452
00:31:44,062 --> 00:31:45,582
[SPEAKER_06]: It's that brand new game coming out.

453
00:31:45,602 --> 00:31:52,584
[SPEAKER_06]: For those of you guys that were wishing and hoping that they would make, like, Amplitude or Frequency, like a new one, from what I understand, they kind of have.

454
00:31:52,604 --> 00:31:55,485
[SPEAKER_06]: They kind of did make a new one, except it just involves a guitar.

455
00:31:55,865 --> 00:31:56,805
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's called Guitar Hero.

456
00:31:56,845 --> 00:31:58,505
[SPEAKER_06]: And Red Octane's the company that's putting this out.

457
00:31:58,545 --> 00:32:00,386
[SPEAKER_06]: Red Octane, of course, famous for making a lot of

458
00:32:00,751 --> 00:32:03,312
[SPEAKER_06]: Music Game Peripherals, and Harmonix.

459
00:32:03,352 --> 00:32:06,494
[SPEAKER_01]: Harmonix being the folks that did bring us Amplitude.

460
00:32:06,554 --> 00:32:09,055
[SPEAKER_06]: Harmonix developed the game, absolutely.

461
00:32:09,675 --> 00:32:11,096
[SPEAKER_06]: And made Karaoke Revolution as well.

462
00:32:11,916 --> 00:32:16,439
[SPEAKER_06]: Harmonix just wrapped up work on Guitar Hero, and Red Octane is going to put it out.

463
00:32:16,739 --> 00:32:18,700
[SPEAKER_06]: It's scheduled to be out November 8th.

464
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:19,960
[SPEAKER_06]: Should be interesting.

465
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:28,685
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of licensed songs in this game, including More Than a Feelin' by Boston, ZZ Top, Sharp Dressed Man, and Franz Ferdinand's Take Me Out.

466
00:32:29,065 --> 00:32:29,305
[SPEAKER_06]: Now,

467
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:30,720
[SPEAKER_06]: I had other commitments.

468
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:31,521
[SPEAKER_06]: I had other commitments.

469
00:32:49,935 --> 00:32:51,196
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

470
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:21,692
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, back away from my nerddom.

471
00:33:22,973 --> 00:33:25,275
[SPEAKER_01]: It has an excellent song list.

472
00:33:26,696 --> 00:33:34,742
[SPEAKER_01]: I played I Wanna Be Sedated, and then I played More Than a Feelin', which I love Boston, and I love the Ramones.

473
00:33:34,943 --> 00:33:39,626
[SPEAKER_01]: There was also Stevie Ray Vaughan in it, Franz Ferdinand, Megadeth.

474
00:33:40,547 --> 00:33:44,270
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not the actual bands, but the folks that they had playing the music was just...

475
00:33:44,824 --> 00:33:45,244
[SPEAKER_06]: Smoke on the Water

476
00:34:13,935 --> 00:34:17,916
[SPEAKER_05]: and Iron Man.

477
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:18,816
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.

478
00:34:19,656 --> 00:34:21,496
[SPEAKER_05]: And I want to say take me out.

479
00:34:23,237 --> 00:34:24,757
[SPEAKER_05]: And just really cool.

480
00:34:25,597 --> 00:34:29,618
[SPEAKER_05]: Really fun game to get into since I'm a big fan of Guitar Freaks.

481
00:34:30,278 --> 00:34:35,419
[SPEAKER_05]: This is definitely a step in the right direction because I like how they have the extra buttons on there so it is a little bit more difficult.

482
00:34:35,539 --> 00:34:41,260
[SPEAKER_05]: So for those people that did actually master Guitar Freaks, this is a whole new challenge for you.

483
00:34:41,667 --> 00:34:49,110
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm just... I didn't get to play it, unfortunately, but I'm just excited that we're getting, like, Amplitude, but, like, different with a new peripheral.

484
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:50,431
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just... because I love Frequency.

485
00:34:50,451 --> 00:34:51,091
[SPEAKER_06]: I loved Amplitude.

486
00:34:51,131 --> 00:34:51,831
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm kind of excited.

487
00:34:52,011 --> 00:34:59,575
[SPEAKER_01]: Being that I heavily imported all the Guitar Freaks games that I could get my hands on except for the FNs, there's no comparison.

488
00:34:59,635 --> 00:35:02,196
[SPEAKER_01]: This game, Guitar Hero, really blows it out of the water.

489
00:35:02,436 --> 00:35:09,319
[SPEAKER_01]: The music quality, being that you're going from basically MIDI to real, you know, instruments...

490
00:35:09,830 --> 00:35:13,653
[SPEAKER_06]: Guitar Freaks has also just kind of gotten stale over like 13 mixes or something like that, right?

491
00:35:13,793 --> 00:35:15,114
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like Simon.

492
00:35:15,234 --> 00:35:16,075
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like playing Simon.

493
00:35:16,555 --> 00:35:19,177
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, press the button in the right order.

494
00:35:19,837 --> 00:35:25,942
[SPEAKER_01]: But this, because you've got the five keys and on top of that, the way that you move your hand, they're calling them fret buttons, I think.

495
00:35:27,122 --> 00:35:28,343
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got a whammy bar on it.

496
00:35:28,383 --> 00:35:30,585
[SPEAKER_01]: Jeez, how much cooler can you get?

497
00:35:31,606 --> 00:35:35,488
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I know I'm gushing about it, but I've got my game on reserve already.

498
00:35:36,049 --> 00:35:37,470
[SPEAKER_01]: The controller itself is...

499
00:35:38,602 --> 00:35:40,943
[SPEAKER_01]: Suitably more substantial than the Guitar Freaks controller.

500
00:35:53,686 --> 00:35:54,286
[SPEAKER_01]: They're the horns.

501
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:28,625
[SPEAKER_06]: 24 Hour Fitness is going to put DDR machines in their kids club portions of the gyms.

502
00:36:28,825 --> 00:36:33,529
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think they have kids club at all, the gyms, but the ones that do, some of them are going to have DDR machines.

503
00:36:33,709 --> 00:36:38,473
[SPEAKER_06]: So an interesting fusion there between Dance Dance Revolution and a legitimate gymnasium.

504
00:36:38,913 --> 00:36:39,413
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting, huh?

505
00:36:39,453 --> 00:36:44,698
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that it's a fascinating marketing tool, and it's sort of one that we've seen it coming.

506
00:36:45,318 --> 00:36:50,022
[SPEAKER_01]: With all the schools that are putting DDR machines in their fitness programs...

507
00:36:51,307 --> 00:36:52,348
[SPEAKER_01]: It was inevitable.

508
00:36:52,368 --> 00:37:01,155
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Konami was also working on DDR Studio, I think it was, where it was going to be like an eight-person DDR thing, and it was crazy.

509
00:37:01,195 --> 00:37:02,296
[SPEAKER_06]: It was meant for gyms.

510
00:37:02,716 --> 00:37:07,320
[SPEAKER_06]: Although we didn't really see if this ever got actually implemented, it's interesting to see this partnership take place.

511
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:09,841
[SPEAKER_01]: I still think Pada Pada would have been a better choice.

512
00:37:11,343 --> 00:37:12,524
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but that, no.

513
00:37:13,184 --> 00:37:16,026
[SPEAKER_06]: Get your upper body moving, but then you'd have to listen to the music.

514
00:37:16,387 --> 00:37:18,868
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing wrong with the Eurobeat.

515
00:37:19,069 --> 00:37:19,589
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm kidding.

516
00:37:19,649 --> 00:37:20,510
[SPEAKER_01]: I watch Initial D.

517
00:37:21,755 --> 00:37:23,695
[SPEAKER_05]: Rhythm Gymnastics, the game.

518
00:37:24,796 --> 00:37:26,076
[SPEAKER_01]: Rhythm Masters.

519
00:37:26,916 --> 00:37:28,997
[SPEAKER_06]: Now you guys have some news on Dead or Alive 4.

520
00:37:29,457 --> 00:37:30,317
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to hear this stuff.

521
00:37:30,637 --> 00:37:32,037
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, what did you have on Dead or Alive 4?

522
00:37:32,698 --> 00:37:33,898
[SPEAKER_01]: DOA 4.

523
00:37:34,078 --> 00:37:36,338
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, their lobby system has been revealed.

524
00:37:37,759 --> 00:37:40,179
[SPEAKER_01]: Famitsu was talking about it.

525
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,560
[SPEAKER_01]: The description that I have seen is that it is wacky.

526
00:37:45,201 --> 00:37:48,261
[SPEAKER_01]: The lobby features 10 various areas.

527
00:37:48,301 --> 00:37:51,002
[SPEAKER_01]: There's like a Halloween theme, a swamp room that you swim through.

528
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:57,661
[SPEAKER_01]: Which, you know, honestly, it totally just fits, you know, what I would have expected.

529
00:37:57,701 --> 00:38:00,202
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if they gave us a volleyball, they'd have to do something goofy.

530
00:38:01,542 --> 00:38:03,242
[SPEAKER_01]: You also have various avatars.

531
00:38:03,282 --> 00:38:04,723
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that there is around 30.

532
00:38:05,123 --> 00:38:11,464
[SPEAKER_01]: You also can have, like, a ninja, ghost, cat, penguin.

533
00:38:11,684 --> 00:38:12,464
[SPEAKER_01]: You get a penguin, Rob?

534
00:38:12,764 --> 00:38:13,064
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

535
00:38:14,345 --> 00:38:21,526
[SPEAKER_01]: And each lobby can hold a maximum of 20 people, and you can chat with people and watch fights that are taking place on a widescreen display.

536
00:38:22,435 --> 00:38:27,981
[SPEAKER_01]: No screenshots yet, but of course there's shots of the game out there.

537
00:38:28,342 --> 00:38:30,124
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was in the recent issue of Famitsu.

538
00:38:30,566 --> 00:38:30,926
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

539
00:38:30,966 --> 00:38:35,770
[SPEAKER_06]: Before I get to Loki's side, I just want to say something real quick about Famitsu Magazine, because it kind of relates to Xbox.

540
00:38:35,790 --> 00:38:40,073
[SPEAKER_06]: They actually just did a study on how the Japanese are kind of looking at the next generation of systems.

541
00:38:42,215 --> 00:38:44,576
[SPEAKER_06]: 24% say that they do want to get an Xbox 360.

542
00:38:45,357 --> 00:38:46,558
[SPEAKER_06]: 40% are still undecided.

543
00:38:46,938 --> 00:38:49,300
[SPEAKER_06]: PlayStation 3, way ahead still.

544
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:56,205
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's just interesting because the Xbox is making a little bit of progress, because the Xbox One, or whatever you want to call it, the regular Xbox, kind of

545
00:38:56,581 --> 00:38:56,721
[SPEAKER_06]: D.O.A.

546
00:39:18,275 --> 00:39:20,136
[SPEAKER_05]: Female character, I believe from Halo 2.

547
00:39:21,097 --> 00:39:24,799
[SPEAKER_05]: And it, I mean, to be honest, looks exactly like Master Chief.

548
00:39:24,819 --> 00:39:25,580
[SPEAKER_04]: Looks exactly like Master Chief.

549
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:28,142
[SPEAKER_05]: So you get to play this game with this character.

550
00:39:28,902 --> 00:39:36,327
[SPEAKER_05]: They said that possibly some alternate costumes that might reveal more of her, you know.

551
00:39:36,507 --> 00:39:39,689
[SPEAKER_06]: We are forgetting what DOA is all about.

552
00:39:39,729 --> 00:39:43,191
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course they put in a female Master Chief.

553
00:39:43,652 --> 00:39:44,032
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course.

554
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:47,514
[SPEAKER_05]: If I'm a betting man, I'm going to say the code is probably Justin Bailey.

555
00:39:50,118 --> 00:39:55,925
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but I don't think that was it Tecmo had anything to do with Metroid?

556
00:39:57,466 --> 00:39:57,767
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever.

557
00:39:58,187 --> 00:40:01,431
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, moving on, I got a quick news for you guys.

558
00:40:01,451 --> 00:40:04,294
[SPEAKER_06]: It relates to Final Fantasy Advent Children.

559
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:10,642
[SPEAKER_06]: 700,000 copies sold since September 14th when it came out in Japan.

560
00:40:11,223 --> 00:40:14,785
[SPEAKER_06]: And 7 million copies pirated on BitTorrent in the U.S.

561
00:40:15,726 --> 00:40:16,547
[SPEAKER_06]: Just kidding.

562
00:40:16,607 --> 00:40:17,087
[SPEAKER_06]: Just kidding.

563
00:40:17,127 --> 00:40:17,467
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

564
00:40:17,527 --> 00:40:18,148
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know for sure.

565
00:40:18,408 --> 00:40:22,371
[SPEAKER_01]: And don't forget, there's a big pre-order push for that.

566
00:40:22,551 --> 00:40:30,637
[SPEAKER_05]: And then today on the Advent Children Release date, you know, it's basically now the end of January.

567
00:40:30,857 --> 00:40:32,379
[SPEAKER_05]: I think January 29th is what I heard.

568
00:40:33,579 --> 00:40:34,340
[SPEAKER_05]: But then I could be wrong.

569
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:35,710
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my, again?

570
00:40:35,911 --> 00:40:36,111
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

571
00:40:36,191 --> 00:40:36,771
[SPEAKER_05]: End of January.

572
00:40:36,891 --> 00:40:37,631
[SPEAKER_06]: Are they foolish?

573
00:40:37,691 --> 00:40:38,972
[SPEAKER_06]: Because this thing's all over the internet.

574
00:40:39,372 --> 00:40:41,793
[SPEAKER_06]: Unless they're going back to add extra content to make us want to get the DVD.

575
00:40:41,873 --> 00:40:42,153
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

576
00:40:42,514 --> 00:40:47,876
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they're going to be pushing, I'm hoping that it's going to be a theater release.

577
00:40:48,116 --> 00:40:56,440
[SPEAKER_01]: They're actually, I have heard from other, though I cannot say who, reputable sources that are saying that it's going to be a limited theater run.

578
00:40:57,921 --> 00:40:58,481
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that would be good.

579
00:40:59,951 --> 00:41:00,572
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe IMAX?

580
00:41:01,093 --> 00:41:04,701
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember mentioning that a while back that I had heard that IMAX was what they were gunning for.

581
00:41:05,843 --> 00:41:08,028
[SPEAKER_01]: That might just be a fanboy's wet dream.

582
00:41:08,068 --> 00:41:08,449
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

583
00:41:08,609 --> 00:41:09,010
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

584
00:41:09,170 --> 00:41:09,752
[SPEAKER_06]: It's my wet dream.

585
00:41:10,069 --> 00:41:11,770
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, thanks for sharing.

586
00:41:13,391 --> 00:41:18,475
[SPEAKER_06]: Moving on, DarkSakura, you have some news about what's going on in the UK in release dates.

587
00:41:18,835 --> 00:41:19,415
[SPEAKER_01]: I sure do.

588
00:41:19,515 --> 00:41:20,496
[SPEAKER_01]: I have our release dates.

589
00:41:21,677 --> 00:41:26,140
[SPEAKER_01]: This is going to be, all of these games are to be released on the 21st.

590
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:37,848
[SPEAKER_01]: We have Buzz the Music Quiz on PS2, Cold War for PC and Xbox, Crash Tag Team Racing, Dragon Ball Z, Budokai Tenkaichi,

591
00:41:40,509 --> 00:41:41,910
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I know how to pronounce Japanese.

592
00:41:43,511 --> 00:41:48,033
[SPEAKER_01]: Dual Master, Shadow of the Code, Fear, which I know a lot of people are looking forward to.

593
00:41:49,154 --> 00:41:52,955
[SPEAKER_01]: Fable, The Lost Chapters, Genji, which is already out over here.

594
00:41:53,836 --> 00:41:54,036
[SPEAKER_01]: L.A.

595
00:41:54,096 --> 00:42:07,783
[SPEAKER_01]: Rush for PS2, Xbox, Marvel Nemesis, Rise of the Imperfects, Namco Museum, Battle Collection, Pokemon Emerald, Rengoku, UFO, Aftershock, WRC Rally Edition, and X3 Reunion.

596
00:42:08,724 --> 00:42:09,885
[SPEAKER_01]: Another couple of notables.

597
00:42:10,365 --> 00:42:12,728
[SPEAKER_01]: The 28th, we have Dancing Stage Mario Mix.

598
00:42:13,389 --> 00:42:18,414
[SPEAKER_01]: We have Makai Kingdom, Chronicles of the Sacred Tome for PS2.

599
00:42:18,774 --> 00:42:19,916
[SPEAKER_01]: Pack and roll on the 28th.

600
00:42:20,836 --> 00:42:25,159
[SPEAKER_06]: You mentioned Fable in there, or Fable Lost Chapters, which is out here already.

601
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:27,461
[SPEAKER_06]: But I just have one quick minor bitch about Fable.

602
00:42:27,581 --> 00:42:28,602
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't work with my TV.

603
00:42:29,022 --> 00:42:30,123
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks like garbage on my TV.

604
00:42:30,203 --> 00:42:32,725
[SPEAKER_06]: Like my HD wigs out on it.

605
00:42:32,885 --> 00:42:34,547
[SPEAKER_06]: Like there's something weird about the mode it uses.

606
00:42:34,947 --> 00:42:36,848
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope the 360 doesn't do the same thing.

607
00:42:37,269 --> 00:42:40,731
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's the only game that I have problems with out of my collection.

608
00:42:40,771 --> 00:42:41,352
[SPEAKER_06]: I have quite a few games.

609
00:42:41,372 --> 00:42:42,132
[SPEAKER_05]: Get the Lost Chapters.

610
00:42:42,272 --> 00:42:42,813
[SPEAKER_05]: It's coming out.

611
00:42:42,953 --> 00:42:44,254
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want the Lost Chapters.

612
00:42:44,294 --> 00:42:45,415
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to play the one I bought.

613
00:42:45,895 --> 00:42:47,697
[SPEAKER_05]: No, you want the Lost Chapters.

614
00:42:47,857 --> 00:42:48,057
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

615
00:42:48,417 --> 00:42:51,058
[SPEAKER_01]: See something also November, just that might be a little fun.

616
00:42:51,518 --> 00:42:53,759
[SPEAKER_01]: SingStar 80s for the PS2.

617
00:42:53,939 --> 00:42:54,479
[SPEAKER_06]: SingStar.

618
00:42:55,159 --> 00:42:56,920
[SPEAKER_01]: And Donkey Kong Country 3 for the GBA.

619
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:00,821
[SPEAKER_01]: I like... Cool, it's Donkey Kong Country.

620
00:43:00,841 --> 00:43:01,421
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

621
00:43:01,761 --> 00:43:02,642
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

622
00:43:03,082 --> 00:43:14,226
[SPEAKER_01]: You also had something about Alien Hamed, which was a game that's out here, but... They are releasing downloadable level packs for owners of Alien Hamed for the Xbox.

623
00:43:15,246 --> 00:43:15,306
[SPEAKER_01]: Um...

624
00:43:16,598 --> 00:43:22,921
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the level packs are saying there's the chicken pack and the Ultra Hyper Load, both containing 25 levels.

625
00:43:23,802 --> 00:43:26,923
[SPEAKER_01]: And so far, it sounds like there are going to be free downloads.

626
00:43:27,183 --> 00:43:31,306
[SPEAKER_05]: When I said Ultra Hyper Load, I was just picturing a long-ass loading screen.

627
00:43:32,566 --> 00:43:36,728
[SPEAKER_06]: Alien Hamednid, or whatever it's called, not a game that I was very interested in.

628
00:43:36,968 --> 00:43:40,230
[SPEAKER_06]: I watched Loki play it for a length of time, and I thought, how boring.

629
00:43:40,832 --> 00:43:44,193
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the comments on here, just a quote from Eurogamer.

630
00:43:44,733 --> 00:43:48,334
[SPEAKER_01]: Mothers, buying your kids 2D shooters will make them better geeks in years to come.

631
00:43:51,514 --> 00:43:55,655
[SPEAKER_06]: I have some news regarding Castlevania, because I've been playing, of course, the DS one a lot.

632
00:43:55,935 --> 00:44:00,096
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, there are brand new Castlevania games coming out for the Xbox and PlayStation 2.

633
00:44:01,436 --> 00:44:03,457
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Curse of Darkness is the game coming out.

634
00:44:03,837 --> 00:44:04,977
[SPEAKER_06]: Should be very cool there.

635
00:44:05,307 --> 00:44:15,431
[SPEAKER_06]: It's set three years after Castlevania III, Dracula's Curse, and Curse of Darkness follows, I guess, a new character, Hector, a former minion of Dracula.

636
00:44:15,551 --> 00:44:16,271
[SPEAKER_06]: Should be interesting.

637
00:44:16,811 --> 00:44:18,212
[SPEAKER_06]: November 1st is the day.

638
00:44:18,392 --> 00:44:20,893
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just around the corner.

639
00:44:21,213 --> 00:44:20,893
$49.99.

640
00:44:21,813 --> 00:44:24,254
[SPEAKER_06]: M for Mature, because you know it's got lots of blood and the good stuff.

641
00:44:24,914 --> 00:44:25,774
[SPEAKER_06]: Should be a good game, though.

642
00:44:26,335 --> 00:44:28,635
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope it's a little better than Lament of Innocence.

643
00:44:28,675 --> 00:44:33,177
[SPEAKER_06]: Not that Lament of Innocence was bad, but it wasn't Symphony of the Night.

644
00:44:34,221 --> 00:44:38,584
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm more looking forward to Matrix The Path of Neo coming out that same week.

645
00:44:39,544 --> 00:44:43,307
[SPEAKER_01]: I did just find something very interesting that I'm looking forward to.

646
00:44:43,327 --> 00:44:43,927
[SPEAKER_01]: What's that?

647
00:44:44,167 --> 00:44:45,028
[SPEAKER_01]: A Bone game.

648
00:44:45,268 --> 00:44:45,988
[SPEAKER_01]: You remember Bone?

649
00:44:46,969 --> 00:44:47,449
[SPEAKER_01]: The comic?

650
00:44:48,089 --> 00:44:48,830
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.

651
00:44:50,071 --> 00:44:51,451
[SPEAKER_01]: I just glanced over here.

652
00:44:53,893 --> 00:45:01,558
[SPEAKER_01]: Telltale Games Apparently they're releasing a Bone game.

653
00:45:02,495 --> 00:45:02,835
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

654
00:45:03,715 --> 00:45:07,237
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I will try to go into more of this next week.

655
00:45:07,297 --> 00:45:08,157
[SPEAKER_01]: I just saw this.

656
00:45:08,677 --> 00:45:12,099
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, for anyone who's fans of the series, it actually looks pretty cool.

657
00:45:12,179 --> 00:45:14,660
[SPEAKER_01]: I found the link on the front page of Eurogamer this week.

658
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,960
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would suggest everyone check that out.

659
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:18,261
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe you'll get some emails on it.

660
00:45:18,341 --> 00:45:21,222
[SPEAKER_06]: Speaking of emails, togo at orangeloungeradio.com.

661
00:45:21,662 --> 00:45:24,023
[SPEAKER_06]: We get emails and we like to read some of them on the air.

662
00:45:24,043 --> 00:45:26,144
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't have time to read all of them, but we do read them all.

663
00:45:27,124 --> 00:45:29,445
[SPEAKER_06]: And we love you guys for writing us and letting us know you care.

664
00:45:30,709 --> 00:45:32,650
[SPEAKER_06]: But we want to respond to some on-air right now.

665
00:45:32,750 --> 00:45:35,953
[SPEAKER_06]: So, DarkSakura, what is in the old Orange Launch Radio mailbag?

666
00:45:36,514 --> 00:45:42,399
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the one about comparing just how bad the video game law is.

667
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:44,481
[SPEAKER_01]: That was actually sent to us by Rob.

668
00:45:44,921 --> 00:45:45,041
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh.

669
00:45:45,402 --> 00:45:46,363
[SPEAKER_01]: Our friend Rob with two Bs.

670
00:45:46,703 --> 00:45:49,645
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, he's king of our forums lately, too.

671
00:45:49,706 --> 00:45:50,286
[SPEAKER_06]: He's a nice guy.

672
00:45:50,506 --> 00:45:53,329
[SPEAKER_01]: A great addition to our forums, yeah.

673
00:45:53,489 --> 00:45:55,411
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, we have one from...

674
00:45:56,109 --> 00:45:58,090
[SPEAKER_01]: Paul in Belfast, Northern Ireland.

675
00:45:58,391 --> 00:45:58,851
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, right on.

676
00:45:59,972 --> 00:46:02,414
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really glad to hear we've got listeners so far.

677
00:46:02,434 --> 00:46:03,014
[SPEAKER_06]: International.

678
00:46:03,054 --> 00:46:04,455
[SPEAKER_06]: I love hearing from the international folks.

679
00:46:04,795 --> 00:46:06,036
[SPEAKER_01]: He has a question for us.

680
00:46:06,276 --> 00:46:06,977
[SPEAKER_06]: Ooh, okay.

681
00:46:07,197 --> 00:46:08,858
[SPEAKER_01]: I will just read this.

682
00:46:09,278 --> 00:46:16,063
[SPEAKER_01]: My question is, have you ever given it some thought of doing a video of your podcast for us to download on PSP like they do with Dignation?

683
00:46:16,784 --> 00:46:19,125
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be totally cool, just a thought.

684
00:46:19,726 --> 00:46:19,806
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

685
00:46:20,874 --> 00:46:27,117
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's the problem with Videocast, is that it's more money to get a video set up and all that stuff.

686
00:46:28,018 --> 00:46:29,419
[SPEAKER_06]: I would love to do it.

687
00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:33,741
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just a matter, the execution is, how in the hell are we going to do something like that?

688
00:46:33,761 --> 00:46:44,447
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, when you're talking about Dig and stuff like that, I mean, that's backed by people who have been in the television industry already, so they kind of have, you know, their ties on how to do it, do that kind of stuff.

689
00:46:45,866 --> 00:46:46,906
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't really have that.

690
00:46:47,146 --> 00:46:53,328
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got a little crappy 15-year-old recorder, but I don't know what kind of a TV show we could do with that.

691
00:46:53,568 --> 00:46:58,590
[SPEAKER_06]: Plus, it's a lot, lot more time because I have worked in television in college and stuff.

692
00:46:58,950 --> 00:46:59,630
[SPEAKER_05]: It is a lot more time.

693
00:46:59,870 --> 00:47:02,171
[SPEAKER_05]: Preparing stuff for the Internet is not fun either.

694
00:47:02,271 --> 00:47:10,334
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm willing to do it, but again, it's just a matter of the fact that we have a budget of $0 and no place to shoot it.

695
00:47:12,274 --> 00:47:18,420
[SPEAKER_01]: that once I get my camcorder, I think that it might eventually be feasible to do a special.

696
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:19,721
[SPEAKER_06]: It's in the back of our minds.

697
00:47:19,841 --> 00:47:20,401
[SPEAKER_06]: We want to do it.

698
00:47:20,622 --> 00:47:28,108
[SPEAKER_06]: And that place we were at, that warehouse we were at the other night, I thought would be a fabulous place to do an Orange Lounge type thing.

699
00:47:28,208 --> 00:47:29,129
[SPEAKER_06]: And I told you about that already.

700
00:47:31,311 --> 00:47:31,991
[SPEAKER_06]: We have ideas.

701
00:47:32,071 --> 00:47:33,913
[SPEAKER_06]: It's something that's constantly been sitting in the back of my mind.

702
00:47:34,053 --> 00:47:39,798
[SPEAKER_06]: Someday, someday, especially with this new iTunes 6.0 and the way that they're really pushing video now with the new video iPods.

703
00:47:40,330 --> 00:47:43,651
[SPEAKER_06]: and of course we like PSPs as well and we've been trying to support that.

704
00:47:44,911 --> 00:47:46,532
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a natural evolution of the show.

705
00:47:46,732 --> 00:47:47,652
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to see it happen.

706
00:47:47,672 --> 00:47:49,473
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just not going to happen cheaply.

707
00:47:49,573 --> 00:47:51,013
[SPEAKER_01]: That means I have to go buy a veil.

708
00:47:52,113 --> 00:47:53,074
[SPEAKER_06]: Any other mails?

709
00:47:54,054 --> 00:47:55,954
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, one last one tonight.

710
00:47:57,795 --> 00:47:59,755
[SPEAKER_01]: One of our listeners, Joseph, wrote in.

711
00:47:59,775 --> 00:48:01,456
[SPEAKER_01]: He's one of the ones who wrote.

712
00:48:01,536 --> 00:48:02,156
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, he won.

713
00:48:02,176 --> 00:48:03,436
[SPEAKER_06]: The rare CD.

714
00:48:03,496 --> 00:48:05,497
[SPEAKER_06]: By the way, those prizes are on their way.

715
00:48:06,962 --> 00:48:17,667
[SPEAKER_01]: He would like for us to plug that they're having their Poly Bimani Games Day at Cal Poly in San Luis Obispo.

716
00:48:18,207 --> 00:48:21,048
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope I pronounced that right because I'm not from here.

717
00:48:21,848 --> 00:48:26,410
[SPEAKER_01]: It's at the Chumash Auditorium inside the University Union at Cal Poly State.

718
00:48:29,291 --> 00:48:30,572
[SPEAKER_06]: They've asked us to go, right?

719
00:48:30,772 --> 00:48:30,972
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

720
00:48:31,072 --> 00:48:33,293
[SPEAKER_06]: But you're going to be busy with the Podcast Awards that weekend.

721
00:48:33,353 --> 00:48:39,194
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually am going to be at the Podcast Awards on the 11th and staying in San Diego to go buy wine.

722
00:48:39,895 --> 00:48:42,175
[SPEAKER_06]: And I might be putting in an appearance.

723
00:48:42,295 --> 00:48:47,357
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to check my calendar, see if I can do it feasibly, but I would like to do it, so we'll see.

724
00:48:48,177 --> 00:48:49,637
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll get back to these folks.

725
00:48:49,657 --> 00:48:52,038
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm still seeing, yeah.

726
00:48:52,058 --> 00:48:53,439
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

727
00:48:53,939 --> 00:48:54,419
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

728
00:48:54,739 --> 00:48:56,560
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki's a little harder to get to do the PR things.

729
00:48:58,912 --> 00:49:00,253
[SPEAKER_06]: Gee, I wonder why.

730
00:49:01,053 --> 00:49:01,614
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to do it.

731
00:49:01,634 --> 00:49:02,334
[SPEAKER_06]: It sounds like fun.

732
00:49:02,634 --> 00:49:03,074
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

733
00:49:04,535 --> 00:49:10,238
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not coming by myself, though, so I'm bringing a random... I might have to bring Extifer from Orange Lounge Radio's live show.

734
00:49:10,278 --> 00:49:11,799
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be hilarious.

735
00:49:12,319 --> 00:49:12,699
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

736
00:49:12,759 --> 00:49:13,099
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

737
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:13,880
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll do it.

738
00:49:14,020 --> 00:49:14,940
[SPEAKER_01]: Take the Digicam with you.

739
00:49:15,361 --> 00:49:16,281
[SPEAKER_06]: If I go, I definitely will.

740
00:49:16,581 --> 00:49:17,942
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll get in touch with this guy on email.

741
00:49:18,182 --> 00:49:22,724
[SPEAKER_01]: But, yeah, I'm already going to the podcast awards, or I would be more than thrilled to go.

742
00:49:22,744 --> 00:49:27,687
[SPEAKER_06]: I also would like to go to the podcast awards, but I can't, but that's a very bitter subject, so we won't go there.

743
00:49:29,033 --> 00:49:30,794
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, real life sucks sometimes.

744
00:49:30,814 --> 00:49:31,294
[SPEAKER_06]: What can you say?

745
00:49:31,574 --> 00:49:33,295
[SPEAKER_01]: I have some more fun, though.

746
00:49:33,495 --> 00:49:33,995
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay, good.

747
00:49:34,295 --> 00:49:34,795
[SPEAKER_06]: I want fun.

748
00:49:34,835 --> 00:49:36,396
[SPEAKER_01]: You remember our friend Steven Spielberg?

749
00:49:39,017 --> 00:49:40,537
[SPEAKER_06]: Didn't we have lunch with him last week?

750
00:49:41,137 --> 00:49:42,598
[SPEAKER_06]: I told him to kiss my ass.

751
00:49:42,618 --> 00:49:43,738
[SPEAKER_06]: I want more money for the show.

752
00:49:44,599 --> 00:49:50,121
[SPEAKER_01]: I ran into, well, not ran into him, but I was eating dinner at Skywalker Ranch.

753
00:49:50,941 --> 00:49:53,222
[SPEAKER_01]: George Lucas walked past us, and I almost flipped.

754
00:49:53,242 --> 00:49:55,403
[SPEAKER_06]: You tell that Lucas story every chance you get.

755
00:49:55,423 --> 00:49:55,943
[SPEAKER_01]: It was cool.

756
00:49:57,068 --> 00:49:57,508
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's cool.

757
00:49:57,588 --> 00:49:59,369
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my god, he's a meatless flicking distance.

758
00:49:59,389 --> 00:50:00,450
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, tell us about Spielberg.

759
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:02,391
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, just a little quickie.

760
00:50:02,511 --> 00:50:09,315
[SPEAKER_01]: He has basically signed a deal with Electronic Arts to publish three original game properties.

761
00:50:10,256 --> 00:50:12,177
[SPEAKER_06]: Will they be overrated like his movies?

762
00:50:13,118 --> 00:50:15,439
[SPEAKER_01]: Likely, but only time will tell.

763
00:50:15,459 --> 00:50:16,600
[SPEAKER_06]: Ooh, I'm looking forward to it.

764
00:50:17,060 --> 00:50:18,681
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it wouldn't be an original property.

765
00:50:18,701 --> 00:50:20,102
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's going to be original.

766
00:50:20,342 --> 00:50:21,202
[SPEAKER_06]: No Indiana Jones.

767
00:50:21,262 --> 00:50:22,303
[SPEAKER_06]: I want War of the Worlds.

768
00:50:23,251 --> 00:50:32,498
[SPEAKER_01]: He has been quoted as saying the new technology represents the future of cinema, and in the future you will physically be inside the experience.

769
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:36,200
[SPEAKER_06]: Inside the experience.

770
00:50:36,721 --> 00:50:42,965
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing they were asking how it's going to work, he said, I invented it, but because the patent is pending, I can't discuss it right now.

771
00:50:44,226 --> 00:50:47,489
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully being inside the experience includes Pam Landerson.

772
00:50:49,224 --> 00:50:51,486
[SPEAKER_06]: Moving on, moving on.

773
00:50:52,587 --> 00:50:56,711
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's get to a story that Loki's got about PSP on the TV.

774
00:50:56,771 --> 00:50:58,353
[SPEAKER_06]: It's something that you've been following for a little while.

775
00:50:58,753 --> 00:51:02,116
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, everybody wants the PSP to be on the TV.

776
00:51:02,196 --> 00:51:06,080
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's only, you've got the UMD movies, which are selling like crazy, of course.

777
00:51:06,761 --> 00:51:14,368
[SPEAKER_05]: The first thing, of course, they have the PSP2 TV, which is actually kind of a,

778
00:51:15,166 --> 00:51:15,746
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

779
00:51:15,786 --> 00:51:16,947
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know about that working.

780
00:51:17,007 --> 00:51:17,327
[SPEAKER_05]: Sounds crazy.

781
00:51:17,347 --> 00:51:17,447
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

782
00:51:17,467 --> 00:51:21,609
[SPEAKER_05]: But it doesn't require modification, and I think that's kind of the selling point of it.

783
00:51:21,669 --> 00:51:21,929
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, okay.

784
00:51:21,949 --> 00:51:22,249
[SPEAKER_05]: That's cool.

785
00:51:44,632 --> 00:51:50,155
[SPEAKER_06]: You also had a story about a mod for the Nintendo, with the GBA Micro being so popular right now.

786
00:51:50,235 --> 00:51:50,455
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

787
00:51:50,996 --> 00:52:03,923
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, the guy behind all those portable systems, like the portable Atari, Ben Heck, he actually created a brand new NES Micro, as he calls it.

788
00:52:04,963 --> 00:52:08,465
[SPEAKER_05]: They've got screenshots on his site here on BenHeck.com.

789
00:52:08,505 --> 00:52:09,986
[SPEAKER_06]: The NES Micro is like...

790
00:52:11,937 --> 00:52:12,517
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

791
00:52:41,106 --> 00:52:41,447
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura

792
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:05,760
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

793
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:15,263
[SPEAKER_01]: However, they're saying that other than the game stores currently in existence, the GameStop ones, they're not going to have that big of a presence.

794
00:53:15,283 --> 00:53:16,463
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not going to really shift things.

795
00:53:16,543 --> 00:53:22,004
[SPEAKER_01]: And from what I've heard, a lot of the EBs are still going to stay and keep operating under the EB name.

796
00:53:22,344 --> 00:53:22,824
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, interesting.

797
00:53:23,144 --> 00:53:29,246
[SPEAKER_06]: So that explains what's going to happen when you have a mall and you have EB, which is right up... We have here in Sacramento, we have a mall...

798
00:53:29,881 --> 00:53:35,644
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a mall where there's a GameStop and then right around the corner there's an EB next to the Cinnabon.

799
00:53:36,405 --> 00:53:38,005
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think either of those stores are going anywhere.

800
00:53:39,646 --> 00:53:44,709
[SPEAKER_06]: People probably wondered, with a merger, is EB going to be GameStop and you just have two GameStops in the mall?

801
00:53:45,029 --> 00:53:45,890
[SPEAKER_06]: Which would be a little crazy.

802
00:53:46,170 --> 00:53:51,513
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe it's still operating under... From what I understood, they were supposed to dissolve the EB name.

803
00:53:51,633 --> 00:53:53,414
[SPEAKER_01]: However, the EB stores are still there.

804
00:53:53,594 --> 00:53:55,315
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know how they're going to manage that.

805
00:53:55,495 --> 00:53:55,815
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

806
00:53:56,275 --> 00:54:00,017
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say I have GameStop A and GameStop B. GameStop A and GameStop B. And for the record.

807
00:54:00,557 --> 00:54:02,718
[SPEAKER_06]: It could be like Express Men and Express Women.

808
00:54:02,738 --> 00:54:06,539
[SPEAKER_06]: They could have GameStop Nintendo and GameStop Xbox and GameStop Sony.

809
00:54:06,559 --> 00:54:07,239
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be interesting.

810
00:54:07,299 --> 00:54:11,381
[SPEAKER_01]: I do need to correct myself, though, as far as Barnes & Noble's involvement in that.

811
00:54:11,461 --> 00:54:16,243
[SPEAKER_01]: GameStop is now a fully functioning business.

812
00:54:16,503 --> 00:54:19,864
[SPEAKER_01]: They're still associated with Barnes & Noble, but they are their own business.

813
00:54:20,525 --> 00:54:20,985
[SPEAKER_06]: Very interesting.

814
00:54:21,365 --> 00:54:23,626
[SPEAKER_01]: No longer a fully owned subsidy, I should say.

815
00:54:24,442 --> 00:54:28,704
[SPEAKER_06]: I got one last story for you guys, and then we'll let Loki finish this out tonight, because I think his thing's a little bit cooler.

816
00:54:29,704 --> 00:54:31,265
[SPEAKER_06]: My last thing is Soul Calibur 3.

817
00:54:32,085 --> 00:54:33,266
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't believe I saved this for last.

818
00:54:33,286 --> 00:54:33,966
[SPEAKER_06]: This is big news.

819
00:54:34,606 --> 00:54:37,787
[SPEAKER_06]: Soul Calibur 3, though, for me, it feels like it's been flying under the radar a little bit.

820
00:54:37,827 --> 00:54:43,289
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe it's just because I'm not following the same news I used to, but I remember Soul Calibur 2 was like this huge freaking deal.

821
00:54:43,730 --> 00:54:49,612
[SPEAKER_06]: Soul Calibur 3, certainly if you're a fighting game fan, is still a huge deal, but this one's kind of been seeming to fly under the radar for me, but...

822
00:54:50,112 --> 00:54:51,733
[SPEAKER_06]: It's still going to look like a cool game nonetheless.

823
00:54:51,833 --> 00:54:55,976
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe it's because, A, it doesn't have Link in it, and B... Link was cool!

824
00:54:56,076 --> 00:54:57,777
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, but he wasn't the whole game.

825
00:54:57,837 --> 00:54:59,899
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, the arcade version of Soul Calibur II was awesome.

826
00:55:00,379 --> 00:55:02,200
[SPEAKER_06]: Ivy is the whole game, really, is what it was.

827
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:04,482
[SPEAKER_01]: The Xbox version of Soul Calibur II was awesome.

828
00:55:05,142 --> 00:55:07,704
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, Soul Calibur III is for the PlayStation 2.

829
00:55:08,064 --> 00:55:10,726
[SPEAKER_06]: It's coming out October 25th, which I was kind of surprised.

830
00:55:10,746 --> 00:55:12,087
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, whoa, that was quick.

831
00:55:13,047 --> 00:55:14,268
[SPEAKER_06]: Also rated T14, $49.99.

832
00:55:14,608 --> 00:55:19,512
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, the big thing about this is that you're going to be able to do, you know, some...

833
00:55:20,575 --> 00:55:21,256
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

834
00:55:41,437 --> 00:55:42,558
[SPEAKER_05]: via Flash on the internet.

835
00:55:42,578 --> 00:55:43,739
[SPEAKER_06]: Like the old-ass Prince of Persia.

836
00:55:43,779 --> 00:55:45,239
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not talking the Sands of Time.

837
00:55:45,259 --> 00:55:52,604
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you mean by the Prince of Persia that was on the NES, the Commodore 64, the Apple, the Game Boy?

838
00:55:53,145 --> 00:55:55,166
[SPEAKER_06]: It was on every system ever at that time.

839
00:55:55,186 --> 00:55:55,626
[SPEAKER_05]: That's correct.

840
00:55:56,327 --> 00:56:04,692
[SPEAKER_05]: You can find us at www.gamespot.com slash promo slash princeofpersia dash game slash flash

841
00:56:06,454 --> 00:56:06,774
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

842
00:56:07,734 --> 00:56:08,255
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

843
00:56:08,415 --> 00:56:10,515
[SPEAKER_01]: Slash partridge in a pear tree dot org.

844
00:56:11,896 --> 00:56:12,096
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

845
00:56:12,156 --> 00:56:12,876
[SPEAKER_01]: Check that out, you guys.

846
00:56:12,976 --> 00:56:13,576
[SPEAKER_01]: Dot EU.

847
00:56:14,016 --> 00:56:14,276
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

848
00:56:15,117 --> 00:56:16,857
[SPEAKER_05]: A couple really quick things.

849
00:56:17,838 --> 00:56:25,360
[SPEAKER_05]: PSP firmware 2.5 came out that allows the movies on the go type thing where you can stream over the internet.

850
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:27,541
[SPEAKER_05]: Too bad that the peripheral that you need to use that is $350.

851
00:56:27,581 --> 00:56:27,661
[SPEAKER_05]: Ouch.

852
00:56:27,681 --> 00:56:28,221
[SPEAKER_05]: That sucks for everybody.

853
00:56:32,438 --> 00:56:34,279
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

854
00:56:54,133 --> 00:56:54,973
[SPEAKER_05]: I need to play more games this week.

855
00:56:55,013 --> 00:56:56,154
[SPEAKER_05]: SSX on tour looks awesome.

856
00:56:56,174 --> 00:56:56,514
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't wait.

857
00:57:22,881 --> 00:57:25,242
[SPEAKER_06]: My final thought is World of Warcraft, setting things on fire.

858
00:57:25,342 --> 00:57:26,283
[SPEAKER_06]: Full report next week.

859
00:57:26,803 --> 00:57:27,343
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.

860
00:57:28,984 --> 00:57:29,925
[SPEAKER_01]: Reject false icons.

861
00:57:30,965 --> 00:57:31,445
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's all.

862
00:57:32,626 --> 00:57:33,186
[SPEAKER_05]: And one more thing.

863
00:57:33,626 --> 00:57:35,167
[SPEAKER_05]: More fun stuff coming to the PSP site.

864
00:57:35,187 --> 00:57:36,148
[SPEAKER_01]: You had your last thought.

865
00:57:37,808 --> 00:57:38,169
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

866
00:57:38,749 --> 00:57:41,230
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, check out the PSP site, olrpsp.com.

867
00:57:41,250 --> 00:57:41,850
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't plugged that yet.

868
00:57:42,391 --> 00:57:43,111
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what, though?

869
00:57:43,351 --> 00:57:46,093
[SPEAKER_01]: We have barely heard from somebody this entire show.

870
00:57:46,533 --> 00:57:46,933
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's that?

871
00:57:48,345 --> 00:57:50,406
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, our little pet ferret.

872
00:57:50,426 --> 00:57:51,086

873
00:57:51,126 --> 00:57:51,466
[SPEAKER_06]: Scoozies?

874
00:57:51,546 --> 00:57:51,966

879
00:57:58,189 --> 00:57:59,169
[SPEAKER_01]: I have just been sad.

880
00:57:59,389 --> 00:58:01,130
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I've been reunited with my ferret friend.

881
00:58:01,390 --> 00:58:01,750

882
00:58:02,031 --> 00:58:02,491

[SPEAKER_06]: I want a vacation.

890
00:58:11,454 --> 00:58:12,375
