Muh-uh-muh-chuh-muh-kaw-key.

22
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:24,340
Just kidding, Orange Lounge Radio will not contain any of that.

23
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:25,240

00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,240

00:02:54,740 --> 00:03:02,740
And this is episode number 158 for this October the 2nd of 2005.

29
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:09,740
You're tuned in to Orange Lounge Radio, radio that gamers really want, and this is Orange Lounge Radio Live.

30
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:13,500
You're home for all the news and discussion on rhythm and music games,

31
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,980
as well as the gamer community and the pop culture world.

32
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:20,980
We're plugged in and fully interactive through our website at

33
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:26,340
www.orangeloungeradio.com. My name is Rob Roberts. You might know me as Sky.

34
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:30,420
Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts. In this corner, the happiest

35
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:31,660
bunny on the farm, Ms.

36
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:34,700
Dark Sakura. I've got legs.

37
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:38,220
You got legs? Do you like bread?

38
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:41,500
Did you say you got legs? I have legs.

39
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:46,740
Oh, that's good. Legs are good. I was listening to some of my Eddie Izzard stuff before I left.

40
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:50,580
Especially if you're trying to play DDR, legs are a good thing. No.

41
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:54,740
There are people without legs who play DDR. Or at least who work on them.

42
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:58,820
How do you play DDR without legs? There's a guy who played with the crutches.

43
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:02,220
Oh yeah, that infamous video. Pretty cool.

44
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:05,900
On the intranet. Alright.

45
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:14,900
Well, um, also not here tonight, just yet, is Loki. He's actually running a little bit tardy tonight, and you know what that means, kids?

46
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:15,900
Fired!

47
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,900
Oh, darn.

48
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:22,900
He'll be, he'll be here soon enough. And actually, we're kind of bummed because we don't have any special guests tonight.

49
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:25,900
There's us. We're special enough.

50
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:28,900
Yeah, it's just the three of us, and of course your calls on the Skyplane.

51
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,900
No, we haven't, we have somebody who's returned to the show.

52
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:31,900
Oh, goody who?

53
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:39,900
I forgot to tell you what I found this week, after incessant listener demand.

54
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:42,900
We dug him up.

55
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:47,900
So, Loki will be here soon enough.

56
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:54,900
Actually, what's kind of sad is that Miklotov, one of our regular guests, was just here, not even an hour ago,

57
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,620
and was going to stay for the show but unfortunately

58
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:59,180
due to some

59
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:04,260
commuting issues had to get back before the show started so he says hi

60
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:04,880
and I guess

61
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,420
too bad he couldn't be here tonight because you know obviously we're talking about

62
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:10,940
EX2 and for once he could have talked about pretty much everything with EX2

63
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:11,740
but

64
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:15,020
we'll get him back here another week and talk about all that fun stuff after you guys have

65
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,420
unlocked all the stuff

66
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:20,500
which is one thing I should say is that tonight we are going to be playing lots of

67
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,760
music from

68
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,880
Dance Dance Revolution Xtreme 2

69
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:28,680
We're going to play a lot of new music, which may include some things you haven't unlocked

70
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,680
yet.

71
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,840
So if you are wary of spoilers, unfortunately I'm going to tell you, you may not want to

72
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,880
listen tonight.

73
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:40,560
But honestly, there's some real good stuff, just stick with it.

74
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,600
I'm assuming that a lot of people out there who were trying to really stay careful of

75
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:49,520
the spoilers probably have either already unlocked this stuff by themselves by now or

76
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,100
just don't care at this point, I don't know.

77
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:55,660
So I just want to warn you guys, we are going to talk about and probably play some music

78
00:05:55,660 --> 00:06:01,300
that is unlockable in DDR Extreme 2, so you guys, it might be a spoiler, but who cares?

79
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,940
The game's been out for several days now.

80
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:04,940
We can spoil.

81
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:07,700
If they don't want the spoiler, they can all go see Serenity.

82
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,020
Yeah, we'll talk about...

83
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:11,740
So that it can make the 80 million and we get a sequel.

84
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,980
We'll talk about Serenity, yes.

85
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:16,620
And we'll talk about other stuff too.

86
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:18,660
I want to talk about that big, big secret.

87
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:32,660
It's not really a secret. It's out there and people have been wanting this in a Bomani game for so, so long and it's out there and nobody, I know somebody found it because people are talking about it, but nobody I know knew about this, really.

88
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:37,660
Except Miggletop who pointed it out to me. But we will talk about all that after this break, kids.

89
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:43,660
So, let's get to the first break of DDR Extreme 2 Music.

90
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:49,660
In this break, we're going to hear, As the Rush Comes, a little bit of Block Rockin' Beats,

91
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:56,660
we're going to hear Genie in a Bottle, and we're going to hear I Will Survive all in this break.

92
00:06:56,660 --> 00:07:03,660
in this break. So we'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.

93
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:41,660
We drift deeper into the sound Traveling somewhere, could be anywhere

94
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:48,660
There's a coldness in the air, but I don't care

95
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:55,660
We drift deeper into the sound, life goes on

96
00:07:55,660 --> 00:08:02,660
We drift deeper into the sound, feeling strong

97
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:10,660
To bring it on, to bring it on

98
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:17,660
He scraped me, he found me, and the rush comes

99
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:52,660
into the sound of life goes on

100
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:55,660
Oh, we did the same thing

101
00:09:52,660 --> 00:10:20,060
I'm back with another one of those block rockin' beats

102
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:34,740
Lyrics from Part 3

103
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:49,720
Subs by

104
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:34,520
If you want to be with me, baby there's no such thing as

105
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:29,960
I was petrified, here thinkin' I could never live without you by my side

106
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:33,960
But then I spent so many nights thinking how you did me wrong

107
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,960
And I put strong

108
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,960
And I learned how to get along

109
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,960
And so you're back

110
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,960
From outer space

111
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,960
I just walked in to find you here

112
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,960
With that sad look upon your face

113
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,960
I should have changed that even less

114
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,960
I should have made you leave your feet

115
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,960
I had known for just one second you'd be back

116
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,960
You lied to me

117
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,960
So I now go

118
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,960
Walk out the door

119
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,960
Just turn around now

120
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,960
You're not welcome anymore

121
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,960
But you're the one who tried to hurt me with your vibe

122
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,960
You think I'd crumble?

123
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,960
You think I'd stay down and die?

124
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,960
No, not I

125
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,960
I will survive

126
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:13,960
Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll feel alive

127
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,960
I've got all my life to live

128
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,960
I've got all my love to give

129
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:18,960
And I'll survive

130
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,960
I will survive

131
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,960
Hey, hey

132
00:13:50,960 --> 00:14:05,540
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

133
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:11,200

I'm starting to lose count, we're getting so high.

136
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,200
We're old.

137
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,200
I know, God.

138
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,440
We have to keep innovating.

139
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,720
We're what, like three and a half years old now?

140
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,720
Yeah, something like that.

141
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,560
We're pretty well potty trained at this point,

142
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,240
and we're going to start preschool soon.

143
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,960
Yeah.

144
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,480
We don't have to use the big kids' pants anymore.

145
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,560
We have like pull-ups.

146
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,040
Yeah.

147
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,880
Mommy, wow, I'm a big kid now.

148
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:39,640
Occasionally, we still do have an accident or two.

i don't see how it couldn't be a carry a mocha honestly i think it was cool

171
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:47,300
although it's like i'm very picky about that song and i would've been i will

172
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:51,800
survive. But the Genie in the Bottle one made me feel highly nauseous. Genie in the Bottle's

173
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:55,600
been a very split down the middle one in the community. Of course I've been reading a lot

174
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,720
of feedback, not just on our forums over at OrangeLodgeRadio, but the more heavily used

175
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:03,640
forums over at DDRFreak.com, and just a lot of feedback for Genie in the Bottle seems

176
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:07,560
very polarized. A lot of people are like, wow, that's different, it's pretty cool. I

177
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:10,840
think it just has to do with if you're like a trance whore or not, because if you're a

178
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,540
trance whore, then of course you're going to like that. It sounds like every other trance

179
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:16,360
song ever made. Yeah, if you're not a trance whore, you're probably not going to like it

180
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:20,280
as much and it's let's face it it's still you know genie in a bottle and

181
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:23,480
while genie in a bottle makes a great karaoke song for me

182
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:27,320
um it's it's not a song that i like to hear

183
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:32,280
otherwise anyway um now you didn't really get a chance to

184
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,360
check out dance dance revolution extreme 2

185
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:38,840
did you jamie you haven't really when i have no life

186
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:44,200
no i did i i ran out and got it on tuesday i i'm gonna wait for loki to

187
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:47,400
to get here because I think he's been playing it too so I'll wait and share my

188
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:50,960
thoughts with him but in the meantime let's go ahead and start off tonight's

189
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:54,560
show as we do every week playing a little bit of how was your cake how was

190
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:59,200
your day and we'll start it off with the one and only dark Sakura the sugar is

191
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:05,780
burning a path down my throat like vodka um I played Nintendogs lots and lots of

192
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:11,700
puppies and that's it I'd even touch World of Warcraft although we did have

193
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:15,120
like a very nerdy discussion friday night after serenity

194
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,160
oh my gosh that was

195
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:20,320
that was pretty cuz we were starting to talk about games for a little while we

196
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,920
were talking about um...

197
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,840
i don't know god what were we talking about

198
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:28,260
different ddr's and stuff and and a couple of my... and our various mmo's

199
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:28,960
oh yeah

200
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:33,080
various mmo's we've played like Ragnarok and Final Fantasy 11 and World of Warcraft

201
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:36,600
and City of Heroes and all this other stuff

202
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,400
we were talking about all those games

203
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,840
and

204
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,600
one of my poor friends who isn't much of a gamer was just kind of sitting there

205
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,000
going

206
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,300
blink blink blink and this is also like his birthday dinner so

207
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:51,040
and then we got on the uh... I should feel bad on to the uh... angel discussion and

208
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:54,280
Buffy yeah then you guys started talking about Buffy and angel

209
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:57,440
all night and then that was the part where I started going blink blink blink

210
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,400
because I'm not much of a Joss Whedon whore

211
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,480
granted I did go out and see Serenity because I was basically I was

212
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,160
essentially dragged by all my friends who are Joss Whedon whores

213
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:08,920
um but it was cool I like Serenity I'm not like OMFG

214
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:13,900
serenity like I'm gonna make all my LJ icons serenity based I have a serenity

215
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:18,340
icon okay I'm just teasing the general like I just noticed this huge influx

216
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:22,660
this past couple weeks is just serenity whoredom amongst the nerds on my LJ list

217
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:26,800
which is cool I mean god knows I have my nerdy things as well so I'm not one to

218
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:30,220
judge but I just noticed that the past two weeks you know have been like

219
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:34,660
serenity things been on overdrive so I'm not like omfg over the movie but it was

220
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:41,620
good it was it was cool I liked the action scenes it was action packed I

221
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:47,940
liked it that part at the end and I liked the black chick with a gun she was

222
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:50,900
cool Zoe because black chick with guns are

223
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:57,980
cool they are all right that's my that's my opinion on Serenity and Rob's movie

224
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:01,460
review yeah no no we actually have extra for here and he's going to give his

225
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:04,360
movie review a little later in the show. And he's actually sitting in Loki's show.

226
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,360
Hello. Hi.

227
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,960
You're our new co-host now. Oh, okay.

228
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,360
If we fire Loki, you're going to have to step in here, so.

229
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:18,560
Okay. I hate Macs and in the group. There you go. He fits right in. I love it.

230
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:21,720
I have a Mac now. Is that a Mac? I hate you.

231
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:28,200
I have a Mac now. I have an iMac that I named Easy Mac.

232
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:34,640
That's cool. It's the graphite one, so it fits in with my dark personality.

233
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:40,600
Except for what games do you play? Do you play the DDR games at all?

234
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:45,560
I enjoy watching people play them. I like Pump It Up.

235
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:52,120
No, I do, because as a person who's not very good at DDR, it felt more natural.

236
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:57,160
Pump It Up felt more natural for me. That's interesting, because I think in a lot

237
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:01,280
of ways Pump It Up is actually a harder game. Even to pick up and learn. I think DDR is

238
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:05,040
a little more beginner friendly to Pump It Up. Not to not Pump It Up. I just don't see

239
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:12,360
this as beginner friendly. I don't know. I just don't have that feet eye coordination

240
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:15,760
that a lot of people do with these DDR games. Well you know it just takes practice. You

241
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:21,120
should have seen me when I first started. I mean, God. You should see you now. Shut

242
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:28,860
up again you should see you now yeah thank you all right anyway why is Fiona

243
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:33,820
Apple on myspace because a lot of musicians put their profile thank you

244
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:37,640
for completely derailing our previous topic that's all right a lot of

245
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:43,340
musicians put their profiles on myspace and like f-list celebrities and D list

246
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:46,820
celebrities put their profiles on myspace so people can add them or D list

247
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:50,060
singers songwriters it's the singer songwriters and then like when you when

248
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:54,140
When you add them to your MySpace, then they'll start spamming your comments with like,

249
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:55,140
Hey!

250
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:56,140
Come check out our show!

251
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:59,360
And then they like paste a huge ass image of a flyer.

252
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,980
This is my sister's MySpace for you guys, because my sister is like the biggest MySpace

253
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:03,980
whore I know.

254
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:07,020
My sister has over 1,000 friends on MySpace.

255
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:08,020
I'm not even kidding.

256
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:09,020
She has over 1,000 friends.

257
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:11,280
I have 64.

258
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,280
And I have 227.

259
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,340
Well, we're not going to go there.

260
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:18,860
And I've posted about 10 entries since I've had my...

261
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:19,860
I don't post any entries.

262
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:20,860
I don't either.

263
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:21,860
I just have my profile.

264
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:23,860
I have my live journal to post entries.

265
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:31,140
And my sexy MySpace emo pics, which reminds me, last night, me, Exeterfer, John, and Precious

266
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:33,220
Amanda were all here last night.

267
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:37,540
See, you kind of have the emo pic thing going on on your MySpace.

268
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:39,140
It's a good emo pic.

269
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:41,380
Every MySpace profile, we're talking about MySpace, Dr. Tanya.

270
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:43,260
That's me holding the camera over my head.

271
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:47,520
See, that's the way to take an emo pic, is take a picture of yourself, okay?

272
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:51,400
So we were actually taking emo pics last night because I think John was borrowing his parent's

273
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,140
digital camera, which is kind of nice.

274
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:56,240
So we were taking pictures of ourselves.

275
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,640
We were doing that thing where you take a picture of yourself in the bathroom mirror

276
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:05,040
and you're half-flexing and you look really sad, like you're going to cry, like you just

277
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:08,440
listened to an entire Linkin Park album or something.

278
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:11,120
Like Evanescence, you know?

279
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,120
And then you're sad inside.

280
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:15,120
But Evanescence makes me happy.

281
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,120
Sarcasm.

282
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:21,560
No, you know, Amanda and I, we were trying to do an emo pic where we were both in the

283
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:25,500
bathroom and she was holding up the camera and taking a picture of us, which is funny

284
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:30,540
because, you know, that way, you know, why would a person do that, you know, which makes

285
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:32,020
it funny.

286
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:33,540
I like that one better, Jimmy.

287
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:38,540
I'm waiting to see how my emo pics turn out, but I will put them on my MySpace.

288
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:42,700
And by the way, kids, Orange Lounge Radio has hopped on the MySpace bandwagon, toot

289
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:43,700
toot!

290
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:47,260
And we've got a club thingy on there.

291
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:50,340
We haven't really done anything with it yet.

292
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:51,380
But it's there.

293
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:52,180
And join it.

294
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:54,900
Because when a lot of people are in the club, then they'll go,

295
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:57,380
hey, why are all my friends in this Orange Lawns Radio Club?

296
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:59,020
And then they'll be likely to check out

297
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:00,500
our station and our podcast.

298
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,820
And then we get popular.

299
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:04,160
And then we can sell commercials on this program.

300
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,160
And we can all quit our day jobs and do Orange Lawns Radio

301
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:06,660
forever.

302
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:08,020
Yay!

303
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,540
That means that I can't move.

304
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:21,100
I don't even know how to access our club on MySpace.com.

305
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:25,980
I think it's like MySpace.com slash clubs slash Orange Lounge Radio or something.

306
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,860
Just do a search in the clubs for Orange Lounge Radio.

307
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:31,620
I don't imagine that there's like some other club named Orange Lounge Radio.

308
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:34,660
I'm pretty sure we're the only club named Orange Lounge Radio, because I can't think

309
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:38,540
of anybody else that would call themselves Orange Lounge Radio, so look for that.

310
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:41,540
So how was your gaming week, Rob?

311
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:48,540
Well, I'll talk about my gaming week on the podcast, but I'll talk about my regular week now.

312
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:49,540
Okay.

313
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:52,540
Let's just mess with you.

314
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:59,540
My week was kind of boring, and I barely slept last night at all, and I took a big ol' nap today,

315
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:03,540
so I didn't really do anything on my Sunday, which kind of sucks. Stop laughing.

316
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:06,540
But you didn't do anything with your Sunday?

317
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:11,500
I went to Lions and ate, but you didn't do anything else?

318
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,500
This program.

319
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,500
Oh, okay.

320
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:18,260
Yeah, but this is nothing noteworthy.

321
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:22,240
I was starting to think that we're starting to do stuff like ice cream.

322
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,240
Ice cream?

323
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,240
We have ice cream?

324
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,240
You're Sunday.

325
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,980
Oh my god, we should totally get ice cream.

326
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:27,980
I know, I totally want ice cream.

327
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:28,980
We should.

328
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:30,220
Xtifer, when Loki gets here, you're our ice cream bitch.

329
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:33,540
You should go get us all a cold stone.

330
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:34,540
Should I really?

331
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:35,540
That would be awesome.

332
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:37,140
I said I have no money.

333
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:38,780
Oh, I don't either.

334
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:41,940
Just give us a big tub of Ben and Jerry's.

335
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,220
A big tub of Ben and Jerry's.

336
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:43,980
Yes.

337
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:46,660
Hey, is my picture, does it look emo?

338
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:47,980
That particular picture, yes.

339
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:49,580
But you know what's funny about that particular picture?

340
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:50,940
We're looking at Myspace, which, by the way,

341
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:53,260
makes for great radio right now, Extover,

342
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:54,620
to be talking about pictures.

343
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:55,980
It does.

344
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:56,540
It's a picture.

345
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:57,300
We should describe the picture.

346
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:57,860
OK, we will.

347
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:00,260
It's Extover, and he's kind of tilted toward the side.

348
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:02,300
He's probably about three years younger in this picture,

349
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:03,060
by the way.

350
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:05,100
And his head's kind of tilted towards the side,

351
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:10,340
he's got that I'm not wearing my glasses look he's got that look of it looks

352
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:14,900
super sexy he's I'm not wearing my glasses you should post that in our chat

353
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:19,580
oh you don't you're not in the chat room you can't post that I'll post it for the

354
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:22,020
listeners later if they want to see you should show me how to get into the chat

355
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:29,420
room during a break I will anyway the rest of my week I did a lot of work and

356
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:33,100
and uh... i uh... did

357
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:35,760
stuff i played a lot of d r

358
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,700
somebody commented today that i look like i've lost weight and i credit that

359
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:42,260
to the three days of d r the plane this week

360
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:45,100
i'm just kidding and not not just for that but i've been playing quite a bit

361
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:50,740
of d r and uh... it doesn't show

362
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:52,340
all right you're still

363
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:54,500
because you had a

364
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:55,420
extra for

365
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:57,620
why don't you know how was your week out today

366
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:08,980
My week was good. I just worked at blah, blah, boring, et cetera, the end and stuff. We went

367
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:19,980
and saw Serenity, which I should get to probably later on, but still it was great and stuff.

368
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:24,540
And then today has been kind of boring. There were a lot of people here when I woke up and

369
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:31,540
and then everybody left. And now it's just me and you guys.

370
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,420
Do you feel abandoned? Are you having abandonment issues?

371
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:36,380
I do. I was planning on, you know...

372
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:38,260
That precious Amanda, Miklotov, had to go.

373
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:42,700
Right. I was planning on hanging out with Miklotov as he was doing the show with you

374
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:43,100
guys.

375
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:46,820
Well, usually when Miklotov is here on the show, he'll drop in and say hi, and then he

376
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:49,880
retires out to the living room because he doesn't really want to be on the show.

377
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:54,460
And we got a new gay channel here, logo, that I was just watching in the other room.

378
00:26:54,460 --> 00:27:00,300
I know, it's super fabulous. And we, they were having a, is that funny?

379
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:05,780
What are you laughing at over there? Is it the chat room?

380
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:11,580
No, just the way it's super fabulous. Yeah, I know, he's a big queer.

381
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:18,920
No I'm not, dude. We went, so I was watching that channel and they have, you know, a lot

382
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:23,460
of super gay programming on it. Well imagine that. I mean, on the gay channel,

383
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:24,460
What are you going to have?

384
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:25,460
You're going to have...

385
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:26,700
Well, you know, they have Wonder Falls, which isn't totally gay.

386
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:31,380
Madonna documentaries and, um, I don't know, what else do you show on the channel?

387
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:37,860
It was actually a reality show based around this gay guy opening a bar for the first time,

388
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:41,340
called Open Bar, and the guy was fucking hot.

389
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:43,980
And he was totally hot.

390
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:50,140
And like, I bet, you know, I bet he has, you know, nice looking balls.

391
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:51,140
I don't know.

392
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:52,140
What?

393
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:53,140
What?

394
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:57,980
Well, you know, sometimes if you look at a guy, you can tell, okay, that guy has good-looking

395
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:58,980
balls.

396
00:27:58,980 --> 00:27:59,980
Whoa!

397
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:01,740
That just came, like, completely out of left field.

398
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:02,740
What the...

399
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:07,420
Oh, I like sitting here right now.

400
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:08,420
You don't know that?

401
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:12,940
Dark Sakura as a straight woman, do you ever look at a guy and go, I bet that guy has some

402
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:14,940
nice balls?

403
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:16,460
Occasionally?

404
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:19,820
Occasionally?

405
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:23,100
I'm more like, I hope he shames those.

406
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:26,780
Yeah. Oh my god. Oh my god. Okay. Oh wow, look at that.

407
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:31,060
Sometimes Harry is better. Amazing. Look at that. We just lost half our listeners.

408
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:35,180
Good job. Now we're down to one listener. Wow. Good job.

409
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:39,180
You lost half your listeners last week. Yes, we went from two to one. Good job.

410
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:44,380
Good job.

411
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:47,380
Anyway, so that's how my week was and my day.

412
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:51,380
That's good to know. Thank you.

413
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:52,380
No problem.

414
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:53,380
Your week was balls.

415
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:55,380
It was hairy balls.

416
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:57,380
And serenity. Hairy balls and serenity.

417
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:04,380
Wow, I'm so glad that the show just instantly went down the toilet. That's great.

418
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:06,380
And Legend of Zaku gets it!

419
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:08,380
What? What did Legend of Zaku say?

420
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:13,380
The in-your-mouth line after, didn't you see Jay and Silent Bob strike back?

421
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:16,940
I did, like, years ago, when it first came out.

Also, interact with us, the Skype line.

425
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:28,620
We're going to open that up in a little while, because I know

426
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:31,220
you guys are dying to give your feedback to Dance Dance

427
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:32,900
Revolution Extreme 2.

428
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,340
However, what we're going to do now, we're going to go to a

429
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:36,460
break, and when we come back from this break, we're going

430
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:39,260
to see if, hopefully, Loki shows up during this break.

431
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:43,100
But even if not, we're going to talk about the big news

432
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:46,820
going on in the Bamani scene that I wonder if you guys even know about.

433
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:48,460
And then we'll talk about the, thank you for that.

434
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:52,640
We'll also talk about the Dance Dance Revolution Extreme 2 and my thoughts

435
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,940
and hopefully Loki's thoughts.

436
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:54,900
Enter Asante.

437
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,480
He's here, thank you.

438
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,860
It's almost like having a studio audience where you can have like an

439
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:02,220
applause sign that lights up.

440
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:04,260
All right.

441
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:09,060
In this break, we're going to hear some more music from DER Extreme 2.

442
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:11,300
We're going to hear Injection of Love.

443
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:16,340
but this is the version of Injection of Love that has the vocals not in it, so see if you

444
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:21,100
like this version, a little bit different there because they actually stripped out Sana's

445
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:26,120
vocals because, controversially, Sana says fuck me in one part of the song where she

446
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:30,820
says fuck me, although some people are saying, no, she doesn't say fuck me, she's actually

447
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:35,020
saying suck me or something else. She totally says fuck me. She totally says fuck me, and

448
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:39,460
even if she's not trying to say fuck me, she says fuck me. So I don't, I don't know if

449
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:43,620
the lyrics. In fact, let me see. Hold on. I have no problem with those words. God dammit,

450
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:49,140
y'all got me on a tangent. Let me pull this up real fast here, because I have to prove

451
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:52,340
something to you people. So for those of you guys that have never heard Injection of Love,

452
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:55,180
even though we've actually played this quite a bit on our show before this was ever in

453
00:30:55,180 --> 00:31:01,180
DDR Extreme USA, here's a little piece of Injection of Love. And you tell me if this

454
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:08,180
This doesn't sound like fuck.

455
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:18,580
A little bit after this part. Let me fast forward a little bit here.

456
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:27,780
She totally said fuck me right there. Come on. She totally said fuck me.

457
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:30,360
It's called injection of love.

458
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:34,640
Of course she said fuck me. Isn't that giving your injection of love?

459
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:38,600
I'm gonna inject you with my meat rod. No, my love.

460
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:43,240
My love rod. In other words, my cock.

461
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:49,760
And in some weird porn way, my balls too. Alright.

462
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:54,480
So I understand if you guys, I don't know, you probably went on some website and looked

463
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:58,720
up the official lyrics or something and maybe it's not fuck, but let's face it, if it's

464
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:04,280
not supposed to be fucked. She did a pretty bad job. She did a Freudian slip. She was

465
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:10,000
thinking about fucking when she sang it. And so she said, fuck me. There. So.

466
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,200
What does fuck mean? Because, get it, she doesn't say fuck right?

467
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:19,880
She says fuck. Actually, to me it sounds more like fook me. Like fook me and fook you from,

468
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:24,840
forget it. Yes, I do. I just wasn't funny. So needless to say, they had to strip out

469
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:29,640
the vocals because you know they weren't going to do that and well I'm assuming

470
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:33,000
anyway that that's why they stripped out the vocals is that you know because you

471
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,600
know it awfully it sounds like fuck in the song although in Dance Dance

472
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:41,080
Revolution Extreme they little they little little fuck slip by and the song

473
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:45,640
highs off you but it's so hard to catch and that's even more controversial as to

474
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:50,680
whether they're really saying fucking you up is the lyric so plus I don't know

475
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:59,700
you know this. I used to think that, what was that one that was in Beatmania? God, now

476
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:03,840
I can't remember what it was. I always thought that they used to say, often kissed by a boy

477
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:11,640
band fucker. Oh. Often kissed by a boy band fucker, often kissed by a boy band fucker.

478
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:18,540
Yeah, that song. I forgot what the song was. I have Wonderland. That was it. Yeah. That

479
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:21,740
in one of the earlier USDDRs as well as like what third mix like way back when

480
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:26,460
okay anyway I swear we're gonna get to the song but I just wanted to get that

481
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:31,660
out there about you know word censorship and all that stuff so here we go

482
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:35,300
starting off this break the instrumental version or as they're calling it the

483
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:38,900
Hina mix of injection of love and after this we're gonna hear some inside your

484
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:45,900
heart, make a difference and my my my, we'll be back after this.

485
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:31,100
One, two, three, four!

486
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:38,100
One, two, three, four!

487
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:59,100
I want you now, my heart's on fire, and so we step, step, step into the love of life.

488
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:04,100
It's time for your love, I'm watching your love

489
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:07,100
I know that you'll be there

490
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:11,100
I'm feeling good, I'm feeling fine

491
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:16,100
I want you now, I want you now

492
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:20,100
Don't ever leave, I know you won't

493
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:25,100
Don't let me go, don't let me go

494
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:29,060
Baby yeah you love me so much

495
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:33,580
Baby yeah you're holding my mind

496
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,080
I want you just to hold me

497
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:38,300
I love that you love me always

498
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:40,580
I want you just to touch me

499
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:42,980
I want to see you near me

500
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:45,260
I want you just to hold me

501
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,260
I love that you love me always

502
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:49,660
I want you just to touch me

503
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:52,780
I'd like to feel inside your heart

504
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:24,660
For your heart, for your dreams, for your heart

505
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:29,660
For your dreams, for your heart

506
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:32,660
When a world is lost in itself

507
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:36,660
And you feel the life is not showing through

508
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:39,660
And you'll forget it's not by yourself

509
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:42,660
But you gotta reach and make this one

510
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:45,660
Let her play, give it a chance

511
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:48,660
Stand up and stand in front at night

512
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:52,660
You can work through it to get the chance

513
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:55,660
We can work from waist to waist

514
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:58,660
Get up and you can just

515
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:05,660
Use it at all times

516
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:07,660
What else can we do?

517
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:10,660
We can do it now baby, cause I'll be fine

518
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:13,660
We can do it now baby, cause I'll be fine

519
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:47,660
Follow your dreams Follow your mind

520
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:50,660
Follow your world Follow your dreams

521
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:53,660
Let's do it now for a dream

522
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:25,080
My, my, my, my How's he ever get this way?

523
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:30,960
Where's he gonna go?

524
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,960
How's he gonna make this good?

525
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,920
What's the sugar take to do it?

526
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:40,440
My, my, my, how's he ever get this way?

527
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:46,440
Where's he gonna go?

528
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:48,320
How's he gonna make this good?

529
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,320
I'm gonna take the joy

530
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:53,320
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my

531
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,320
How do you get this one?

532
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,320
Where is the door?

533
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:00,320
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my

534
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,320
Oh, tell me where you're gonna take it from

535
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,320
We'll do what I think they're doing

536
00:40:34,320 --> 00:41:00,320
Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

537
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:09,480
We're back here on Orange Lounge Radio. Hope you enjoyed that break of more EX2 music,

538
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:15,520
including Injection of Love, Inside Your Heart, Make a Difference, and My My My. As a reminder,

539
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:21,800
tonight's show is filled with Dance Dance Revolution Extreme 2 spoilers, and if you

540
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:26,600
are afraid of hearing something that might spoil Dance Dance Revolution Extreme 2 for

541
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:31,920
Let me remind you Dance Dance Revolution Xtreme 2 is not a movie or a story. There is nothing to spoil.

542
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:37,220
Oh no, we told you a song is in the game. You still have to work to unlock it.

543
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:43,840
I don't, that's one of those things I kind of don't get quote-unquote on DDR Freak right now, get, putting quotes,

544
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:46,080
is that everybody in the Xtreme 2 thread is,

545
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:52,040
and even I had to do this myself because I feared the angry mob if I didn't. They were, you know, putting all the

546
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:54,800
spoilers in hidden like you have to

547
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:59,400
highlight with your mouse type text because you know they don't want you

548
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:03,240
know people are not wanting the game to be spoiled but I'm thinking anybody with

549
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:07,240
common sense would think if I don't want to spoil this game I probably shouldn't

550
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:10,920
go on a discussion forum where people were talking about how how much they've

551
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:13,680
been playing it and how great the game is and all the songs they've been getting

552
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:17,200
so I'm not I'm not sure I get the point of why we're being so sensitive about

553
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:24,600
spoilers so whatever maybe somebody will call up and yell at me for spoiling

554
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:28,600
uh... dancers revolution extreme too but you know what

555
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,200
i warned you

556
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:31,920
welded

557
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,840
well look he's here he's he's back

558
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:36,920
yeah doing i'm i'm good fired

559
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:41,140
no i'm scared i'm not fired i i had top-secret working working on them

560
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:45,460
and that's going to have to get a sandwich also right that's fine

561
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:49,400
you're allowed to be late once in a while but don't let it happen again

562
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:53,760
how you doing how was your week how was your day? um... my week was okay today was kind of

563
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:59,240
weird because Nellie decided, you know, instead of watching the Food Network today, she wanted

564
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:07,400
to watch TLC, which, um, they were playing, um, it's like a whole line-up of medical procedures

565
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:11,440
that could go wrong. Like, for example, they had, um, you know, plastic surgery gone wrong

566
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:17,000
and then they had another one that was, uh, when medical instruments get left behind,

567
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:21,240
you know, a whole series of people, oh, look, we left the sponge in you. Oh, look, there's

568
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:27,240
I'm sorry, but we've replaced your heart with a baked potato. You have five seconds to live.

569
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:28,240
Exactly.

570
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:29,240
Oh, sure.

571
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:33,240
It was just like, you know, I didn't need to be watching that stuff, so. But other than

572
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:37,920
that, no. Really not too much going on. Except, I don't know, I'm just getting some more games

573
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:38,920
to sell back.

574
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:39,920
Right on.

575
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:42,520
So, I'm clearing out, you know, my excess crap.

576
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:43,520
Okay. Cool.

577
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:49,320
What else was I going to ask you about? Oh, actually, I wanted to tell the listeners about

578
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:53,960
this. Before the break, you missed a little bit of show, obviously, Loki. Luckily you

579
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:59,920
missed the conversation on balls, because Extrofer got us started talking about balls,

580
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:04,200
as Extrofer tends to do on this program, bring up something X-rated we shouldn't be talking

581
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:08,960
about on the internet. But one other thing we were talking about was Injection of Love,

582
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:13,480
the censored version, quote unquote, that's in DDR Extreme 2, and how they took out the

583
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:17,680
Fuck Me line by just basically taking out all the vocals. Well, thanks to one of our

584
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:22,520
our listeners who's listening tonight, who's in our chat room, Color of Sakura, she actually,

585
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:28,080
or he or she, sorry, actually quoted, sorry, I don't take note of everybody's gender sometimes.

586
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:35,060
This person actually sent me a picture of the 2DX Red Booklet that actually shows the

587
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:40,240
lyrics here to Injection of Love, and sure enough, something, something in Japanese,

588
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:45,440
touch me, something, something, lick me, something, something, stroke me.

589
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:48,340
She's supposed to be saying, stroke me.

590
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:52,800
Okay, so keeping that in mind, here we go again, I'm going to play you the vocal version

591
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,940
of Injection of Love, that little piece here.

592
00:44:54,940 --> 00:45:00,220
You tell me, fuck or stroke, you be the judge.

593
00:45:00,220 --> 00:45:14,660
That's clearly an F. That is clearly an F.

594
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:20,180
that is not stroke me fuck me does not sound like stroke me unless you have some

595
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:24,300
weird fucking accent that's all I gotta say if she pronounces her S's like F's

596
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:30,140
like we're gonna go club some baby feels or we're gonna I don't yeah it doesn't

597
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:33,300
work I'm sorry I don't care what the lyric book says thank you for sharing

598
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:41,620
the restaurant is down the feet I don't know I do a print I do appreciate you

599
00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:46,180
sharing the lyric book though at least um I know she was drunk if he Oh sauna

600
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:49,940
sauna because I remember when I was drunk at Dave and Bester's and I called

601
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:57,780
my food a chili feet steak all right it was a silly cheesesteak

602
00:45:57,780 --> 00:46:04,340
mpq and chat room says a kiriyamoka said stroke but sauna said fuck discussion

603
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:08,340
over I can agree with that sauna butchered the lyrics to injection of

604
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:13,180
love. It makes for a good Bimani drama story. And then, of course, naturally that's followed

605
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:22,180
up. Leave this to our chat room with Sakurina saying, a Kiryamoka must have big balls. You

606
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:28,340
guys are so immature. All right, anyway. Balls! Shut up. I know you're talking about the drink,

607
00:46:28,340 --> 00:46:35,060
right? All right. Yeah. Balls. Yeah. I want to talk about, I want to talk about Pump It

608
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:38,060
I want to talk about one more thing too. No, I want to talk about Pump It Up first.

609
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:39,060
What do you want to talk about?

610
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:44,060
Okay, so this is the first time I got, well yesterday I got a sandwich at Rayleigh's.

611
00:46:44,060 --> 00:46:45,060
That was okay.

612
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:48,060
Today I got a sandwich and they were like, what kind of turkey would you want?

613
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:51,060
I'm like, I thought there was only one kind of turkey, you know?

614
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:52,060
The bird turkey.

615
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:57,060
So I am all, I just want that one because it looked like the turkey I normally get.

616
00:46:57,060 --> 00:46:58,060
Well this is salsa turkey.

617
00:46:58,060 --> 00:47:03,060
Now I don't know what the difference is, but it's sort of dipped in salsa.

618
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:04,060
It's a Mexican turkey?

619
00:47:04,060 --> 00:47:08,140
turkey? I guess. I didn't know there were Mexican turkeys. Is there a lambada turkey

620
00:47:08,140 --> 00:47:14,140
in a... More importantly, is it tasty? Foxtrot? It tastes like salsa, partially. Imagine that.

621
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:19,860
That doesn't sound yummy. Anyways, go ahead. Oh, thank you. I actually had a music video

622
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:23,980
game. I don't know if you guys remember, but we did create this show to talk about music

623
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:29,460
video games. When do I get bored of the game? Pump It Up. I want to talk about Pump It Up.

624
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:32,160
Huge news in Pump It Up and I don't think

625
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:36,120
many people notice this. Something was released on Xbox Live for Pump It Up this

626
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:37,160
week and it's the

627
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:39,240
Pump It Up Step Chart Editor.

628
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:43,160
It's something that you download on Xbox Live and when I say download it's

629
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:47,120
actually very similar to the way the characters in UltraMix 2 were

630
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:47,800
unlocked

631
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:51,000
where you're basically downloading a code or something that

632
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,840
unlocks it inside the game because it's only a five block file

633
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:58,120
and I have a hard time believing that a step editor would fit in five blocks of data.

634
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:02,160
Um, you download this thing and then you suddenly have a step editor available to you in Pump

635
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:03,160
It Up.

636
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:04,160
No big deal, right?

637
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:05,320
It just puts it up there on the level with DDR.

638
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:07,460
You can create your own steps to songs.

639
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:13,560
And in fact, the editor in Pump It Up is a hell of a lot like the DDR editor, but, you

640
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:15,000
know, with pump arrows.

641
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:19,400
Um, but here's the really interesting thing that I think might have slipped through some

642
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:21,300
of the cracks and some people didn't notice.

643
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:26,720
Not only can you edit the steps to songs in Pump It Up, but you can create brand new step

644
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:30,280
files to songs loaded on your Xbox hard drive.

645
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:33,320
You can use the custom soundtrack feature to create

646
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:36,640
your own arrows to songs that you rip to your hard drive.

647
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:40,800
So finally, we have this game out there that allows you to

648
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:44,220
create steps to your own music, which is something

649
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:46,920
people have been wanting in DDR for a long time.

650
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:47,880
That's pretty cool.

651
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:50,080
Licensing issues, of course, make that a nightmare.

652
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:53,240
Now obviously, you can't really take these files and

653
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:54,960
send them over the internet to other people.

654
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:57,960
I imagine there must be a way to do it using an Xbox memory

655
00:48:57,960 --> 00:48:59,060
card, maybe.

656
00:48:59,060 --> 00:49:02,160
I don't know enough about Xbox memory to know if you can

657
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:04,020
transfer, maybe one of our listeners knows, to know if

658
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:06,580
you can transfer a soundtrack, quote on quote, something you

659
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:10,540
rip on the CD, to take something that you rip on the

660
00:49:10,540 --> 00:49:12,740
soundtrack to a memory card.

661
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:14,340
Obviously, you could take the step file and put it on your

662
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:16,540
memory card, but I don't know if you could take Soundtracks

663
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:18,500
and put it on a memory card.

664
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:21,840
So hypothetically, if you could do that, put the

665
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:23,780
soundtrack on the memory card and your step file on the

666
00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:28,480
card, you could essentially give these to your friends via the memory card.

667
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:32,120
And here's the other cool thing about Pump It Up, putting your own songs, your own step

668
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:38,760
files, it has this preloaded background movie, so your song even has its own background movie,

669
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:39,760
which is kind of cool.

670
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:44,320
So, it's just a generic thing with like, you know, one of those rotating cubes and lights

671
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:45,320
and, you know, it's very...

672
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:46,880
Is it with the boobies?

673
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:48,520
It's not the booby law, unfortunately.

674
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:50,640
It's not the booby law.

675
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:55,040
But somehow a lot of people didn't notice this.

676
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:56,880
I mean, it was actually announced on the official

677
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:58,280
Pump It Up website.

678
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:00,320
This actually came out on the 29th.

679
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:03,080
And Miklotov and I were just randomly serving the internet

680
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:03,480
this morning.

681
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:04,600
And he was like, wait a minute.

682
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:06,680
Did you realize that they put this all out there?

683
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:08,720
So we hooked up Xbox Live.

684
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:10,800
And sure enough, we just went on and downloaded it.

685
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:13,820
So if you own Pump It Up Exceed for Xbox, I don't think

686
00:50:13,820 --> 00:50:15,360
this exists in the PS2 version.

687
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:18,000
This only exists in the Xbox version, as far as I know.

688
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:18,520
Check it out.

689
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:20,360
Well, obviously, it wouldn't matter, because PS2 doesn't

690
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:25,200
you to have custom soundtracks. Check it out. Rip your own music to the Xbox hard drive.

691
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:31,840
It's very easy to do within the Xbox. In fact, I actually, what I did, I burned a CD from

692
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:37,960
iTunes and just ripped it on my Xbox, so I have like a mix of music. But I understand

693
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:42,120
that not all Xboxes will read burned CDs, because from what Mikolatov was telling me,

694
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:43,120
his Xbox won't read burned CDs.

695
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:44,400
Ours will either.

696
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:45,400
That's weird. Mine will.

697
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:48,240
It also depends on the quality of the CD that you use.

698
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:54,280
be. He's theorizing this because I have the Halo Xbox, that maybe somehow the drive in

699
00:50:54,280 --> 00:51:00,200
mine is different and it allows it to read the burned disc. I don't know. But that's

700
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:06,040
one thing. So before you try that, realize that your Xbox may not read the burned thing

701
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:11,520
and rip it to the custom soundtrack, but I'm hoping you still have some legitimate CDs

702
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:18,880
in your collection out there, boys and girls, so you can certainly rip those.

703
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:22,520
Very very interesting.

704
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:26,480
So I think a lot of people didn't really realize that because I don't think a lot of people

705
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:30,360
are following what's going on in the Pump It Up scene, but that's what we're here at

706
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:32,840
Orange Lounge Radio to do, so have fun with that.

707
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:36,840
Go dig up your copy of Pump It Up and have fun making your own steps there.

708
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:44,320
be interesting. Oh, somebody in the chat room is actually telling me, Rontan is actually

709
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:51,640
saying that there are three different types of Xbox drives. So possibly I have one of

710
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:55,240
the ones that will let you read the burned CDs, whereas the old Xboxes don't do that.

711
00:51:55,240 --> 00:52:00,800
I don't know. Anyway. Now of course a lot of our chat room is using this opportunity

712
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:07,760
to say, Andamiro wins, Andamiro F'd Konami in the A, Andamiro loves us long time, Andamiro

713
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:12,480
yay yay yay, and of course I realize this is a feature people have been wanting for

714
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:21,020
forever, but did Andamiro serve Konami? Is this gonna revolutionize things? I say no.

715
00:52:21,020 --> 00:52:28,080
You know why I say no? Because you can't share these files. There's no easy way. I'm sure

716
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:33,080
hacker people out there that know how to get to the raw files on the Xbox hard drive and

717
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:36,040
would therefore be able to rip the files, copy them, and send them over the internet

718
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:39,760
to somebody else who would know how to load them onto their hard drive. But that's not

719
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:45,280
the normal Xbox user. So I don't think a lot of people are going to be able to do much

720
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:50,280
with these custom things they make, and so I don't think it's going to be a widely used

721
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:53,800
thing. I actually don't, I mean, I don't, it's kind of a bitch to create your own step

722
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:59,200
file and pump it up, especially from a song because, to put this in perspective, the song,

723
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:02,920
track number one was Endless Day by Echo Image on my custom soundtrack, so we decided to

724
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:07,260
try and make a step file of that. Well, not only do you have to figure out the BPM, although

725
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:11,900
Pump It Up does have a little thing where you can tap the X button on each beat and

726
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:15,520
it'll calculate what the average beat per minute is you're clicking, so you can kind

727
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:20,240
of figure out the BPM that way. But the problem is you have to set the delay as well, and

728
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:24,040
And that was a real bitch for us to figure out the delay, because there was no easy way

729
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:28,320
for us to, like, there was no press the X button when the song starts type thing, so

730
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:31,880
we had to actually calculate in time the delay.

731
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:33,080
So it was kind of a bitch to do.

732
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:35,800
But once we got it, it was pretty cool.

733
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:40,640
But I don't know how many people are going to take the time to do that, just to play

734
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:41,640
their own song.

735
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:42,640
I don't know.

736
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:43,900
Maybe I'm underestimating what people want to do out there.

737
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:47,840
There's a whole Simphile community that has to do it the same way, so...

738
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:51,840
Yeah, but the thing about the SymFile community is that you can zip those up, send them on the internet very easily.

739
00:53:51,840 --> 00:54:01,840
StepMania practically endorses that kind, I mean, they don't endorse it, I guess, but they thrive on that type of distribution, basically.

740
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:04,840
Is that, you know, you even have, what, the SM zip file?

741
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:10,840
You know, an archive file that's specifically made for StepMania, which is the way, what, like FoodMix and stuff was distributed, right?

742
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:13,840
Yeah, it's just a zip file with some other program that runs it.

743
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:16,240
basically.

744
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:18,280
So yeah, it is the same as making a SIM file.

745
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:20,920
But at the same time, a SIM file is very easy to get out

746
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:21,840
there and share.

747
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:24,040
And let's face it, I think that's what motivates people.

748
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:29,480
It's because people want to share what they've done.

749
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:32,920
I think one way that this could be improved upon is for

750
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:37,240
Ann DeMuro to set up a database very similar to what

751
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:40,680
UltraMix 2 had, where users can submit their own step

752
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:42,980
files and then share it with each other.

753
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:43,980
Now the problem is, of course, you

754
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:45,340
wouldn't be able to share the music because that's

755
00:54:45,340 --> 00:54:46,860
all type of copyright laws.

756
00:54:46,860 --> 00:54:49,620
But if you had maybe like, you say,

757
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:54,260
this is track one on the latest garbage album or something.

758
00:54:54,260 --> 00:54:55,780
And then, assumably, if everybody

759
00:54:55,780 --> 00:54:59,620
ripped the same track, it would all be the same, right?

760
00:54:59,620 --> 00:55:00,780
I don't know.

761
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:02,580
Does you kind of understand what I'm saying?

762
00:55:02,580 --> 00:55:03,080
I don't know.

763
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:04,860
Maybe not so feasible, but it's a way

764
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:08,020
to do it legally where you could distribute the SIM files.

765
00:55:08,020 --> 00:55:12,080
So go figure.

766
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:13,480
So I don't know.

767
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:16,000
I don't really think I'll be really using this feature

768
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:16,660
for anything else.

769
00:55:16,660 --> 00:55:17,320
I tried it once.

770
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:17,820
It's cute.

771
00:55:17,820 --> 00:55:20,560
But I don't really want to make my own step files to dance to,

772
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:23,280
because I'll be able to beat it too easy if I made it.

773
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:25,720
I don't have Pump It Up.

774
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:26,520
You should get it.

775
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:28,840
It's surprisingly good.

776
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:31,360
I got a free game, though, while Dan was in Texas.

777
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:32,280
And what's that?

778
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:34,360
I have Taiko Drum Master.

779
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:35,320
Oh, Taiko Drum Master.

780
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:36,560
How's that?

781
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:39,400
Well, I haven't opened mine yet, but I've played other people's.

782
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:43,900
I kind of want the Japanese one, just because of the other songs in it.

783
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:48,760
But he picked up the Red Octane drum thing.

784
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:52,220
So I'm going to do a comparison of them so that I can talk about it on the show.

785
00:55:52,220 --> 00:55:56,100
I've been hearing from a lot of people that the Red Octane one is highly inferior

786
00:55:56,100 --> 00:56:00,420
to, of course, the official stuff. But then again, that happens with most any.

787
00:56:00,420 --> 00:56:03,520
Right, well I mean when they're trying to sell it cheaper, they're going to use cheaper

788
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:04,060
parts.

789
00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:07,700
I look at it, it's a cheap knockoff. All their products are cheap knockoffs.

790
00:56:07,700 --> 00:56:11,140
At least it wasn't as bad as the rave disc man.

791
00:56:11,140 --> 00:56:11,940
The what?

792
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:15,820
The two triangles that were the 2DS controller?

793
00:56:15,820 --> 00:56:20,100
Oh, that.

794
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:21,260
Very interesting.

795
00:56:21,260 --> 00:56:25,020
All right, um...

796
00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:29,060
Okay, we're going to... I think we're going to open up the Skypoint pretty soon here.

797
00:56:29,060 --> 00:56:31,780
I don't want to go to another break just yet, so I guess we'll go into the next topic.

798
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:35,540
Let's talk about what's been going on, of course, with DDR Extreme 2.

799
00:56:35,540 --> 00:56:38,060
Now, Loki, have you gotten to play Extreme 2 at all?

800
00:56:38,060 --> 00:56:38,900
Yeah, I haven't.

801
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:40,780
We haven't really talked about our thoughts on the game yet.

802
00:56:40,780 --> 00:56:43,060
So I'm kind of curious because I want the listeners

803
00:56:43,060 --> 00:56:44,460
to be able to give their feedback when we come back

804
00:56:44,460 --> 00:56:45,940
from the next break on the Skype line.

805
00:56:45,940 --> 00:56:48,000
So we should share what we think of Extreme 2.

806
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,340
So what do you think?

807
00:56:49,340 --> 00:56:50,460
How is Extreme 2?

808
00:56:50,460 --> 00:56:51,180
I like it.

809
00:56:51,180 --> 00:56:53,220
I just got the play up for like one night, though.

810
00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:55,140
Haven't really gotten to play too much of it,

811
00:56:55,140 --> 00:56:58,060
but unlocked like quite a few things.

812
00:56:58,060 --> 00:56:59,780
Yeah, in the dance master mode?

813
00:56:59,780 --> 00:57:00,500
Yeah.

814
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:01,420
That's pretty cool.

815
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:03,060
I like the way they're doing that.

816
00:57:03,060 --> 00:57:04,820
The hidden steps that are in there,

817
00:57:04,820 --> 00:57:09,820
So that's kind of a throwback to the old Guitar Freaks, you know, first mix.

818
00:57:09,820 --> 00:57:14,820
I wish they'd do that with the rest of the songs, like, instead of just one step, have a bunch of them in there.

819
00:57:14,820 --> 00:57:16,820
That'd be kind of neat.

820
00:57:16,820 --> 00:57:22,820
Um, and then, just some of the, um, well the characters I couldn't give a crap about.

821
00:57:22,820 --> 00:57:27,820
I think that the fact that they buy their other outfits for like $100,000 is retarded.

822
00:57:27,820 --> 00:57:32,820
I mean, I'm like, hmm, should I buy one outfit or 20 songs?

823
00:57:32,820 --> 00:57:34,820
That's a tough one there.

824
00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:38,820
Yeah, the outfits are something I think you save up for and get later on with the points.

825
00:57:38,820 --> 00:57:41,820
But I do like the whole shop thing and the way you unlock songs that way.

826
00:57:41,820 --> 00:57:46,820
So that way it's like, well, I don't want to unlock that song, so I'm going to save my points and unlock another one.

827
00:57:46,820 --> 00:57:54,820
Exactly. Like, I was pretty much passing up a lot of the stuff that I've had, you know, played to death before in other DDR versions.

828
00:57:54,820 --> 00:58:01,820
Like Air. I didn't bother to buy Air. I already have that in extreme Japan, so I saved up the money and bought Inside Your Heart instead.

829
00:58:01,820 --> 00:58:03,820
kind of interesting, that I could choose to unlock things.

830
00:58:03,820 --> 00:58:07,820
Yeah, about Inside Your Heart and some of those other ones.

831
00:58:07,820 --> 00:58:09,820
Polytary Can't Sing.

832
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:10,820
That's not Polytary in that song.

833
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:12,820
Okay, I know that.

834
00:58:12,820 --> 00:58:13,320
Right.

835
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:13,820
But Polytary Can't Sing.

836
00:58:13,820 --> 00:58:15,320
Oh right, you know, we'll probably hear that.

837
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:16,320
Which is true.

838
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:16,820
Yeah.

839
00:58:16,820 --> 00:58:17,320
Polytary Can't.

840
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:18,320
I'm talking about the new songs that she did.

841
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:18,820
Passion of Love.

842
00:58:18,820 --> 00:58:19,820
Yeah, Passion of Love.

843
00:58:19,820 --> 00:58:21,320
That was crap.

844
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:25,820
I was like, oh wow, everything that happened with Orbitribe just like went down the tubes,

845
00:58:25,820 --> 00:58:28,820
just went back to like sucking it up, you know.

846
00:58:28,820 --> 00:58:34,660
I just was amazed at how much she really sucked on the

847
00:58:34,660 --> 00:58:36,380
long gun

848
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:39,740
I think she's alright on there. I think she's actually pretty good on there.

849
00:58:39,740 --> 00:58:41,820
A woman can't hold a key.

850
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:43,380
Her teacher should have just

851
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:48,600
you know, smacked some ability to stay in tune into her, but no.

852
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:51,840
She was supposed to be professionally trained in my ass.

853
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:56,660
I can fart in key better than she can sing in key, okay?

854
00:58:56,660 --> 00:58:57,540
Alright.

855
00:58:57,540 --> 00:58:58,540
uh...

856
00:58:58,540 --> 00:59:00,980
well they say that uh...

857
00:59:00,980 --> 00:59:04,740
extreme to you know a lot of people are pitching because sakura and i think i

858
00:59:04,740 --> 00:59:09,180
had their backgrounds changed all while they translated to people can read it

859
00:59:09,180 --> 00:59:11,740
who give the fuck i people are

860
00:59:11,740 --> 00:59:13,300
why

861
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:15,140
i don't like the shape of the air

862
00:59:15,140 --> 00:59:18,660
it's too well there are no you know it's what you know it's funny on the

863
00:59:18,660 --> 00:59:21,380
background somebody posted on the

864
00:59:21,380 --> 00:59:24,660
freak threat and i apologize i remember who posted that somebody said

865
00:59:24,660 --> 00:59:29,500
Wouldn't it be funny if in UltraMix 3, the banners weren't changed?

866
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:36,180
FYI guys, Sakura and Daikankai were in the E3 demo of UltraMix 3, and from what I recall,

867
00:59:36,180 --> 00:59:38,420
I would have noticed if they changed those banners.

868
00:59:38,420 --> 00:59:40,740
They didn't change those banners in UltraMix 3.

869
00:59:40,740 --> 00:59:45,100
So unless something changed between E3 and when this game comes out,

870
00:59:45,100 --> 00:59:47,560
whatever that poster said is going to be absolutely right,

871
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:51,220
where Extreme 2 had their backgrounds changed, and Extreme 3...

872
00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:57,220
It might just, they might, no. Extreme 2 and Ultramix, Extreme 2 had their backgrounds changed and Ultramix 3 did not.

873
00:59:57,220 --> 01:00:03,220
Yeah, but the artwork, the artwork for the backgrounds is going to be the last thing. They're, of course, going to use whatever they have at the moment, you know, for the backgrounds.

874
01:00:03,220 --> 01:00:08,220
So, who gives a crap? I mean, we're talking like, a few pixels here. I mean, who cares?

875
01:00:08,220 --> 01:00:11,220
So what? It's translated. Big deal. It's an American game now.

876
01:00:11,220 --> 01:00:16,220
But, she has Sakura tattooed on her face, which makes no sense now. I know.

877
01:00:16,220 --> 01:00:20,220
Well, it's probably not a tattoo. It's probably just the fucking name of the song.

878
01:00:20,220 --> 01:00:25,220
If they were going to translate it, they just would have put Cherry.

879
01:00:25,220 --> 01:00:30,220
I guess that's true. They could have done worse. They could have just given us the English names of the songs.

880
01:00:30,220 --> 01:00:34,220
Huh? Could have been worse. You know what is interesting about speaking of Sakura?

881
01:00:34,220 --> 01:00:39,220
I actually haven't gotten to the song yet. I've only been reading fan feedback on DDRFreak.

882
01:00:39,220 --> 01:00:44,220
But you notice that the background videos are all totally different and extreme too.

883
01:00:44,220 --> 01:00:49,000
too there's no it looks like they don't use the looping thing anymore like you

884
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:52,380
know how now you like that you would go like video a for a little bit and then

885
01:00:52,380 --> 01:00:56,360
video B go to the spinning Beethoven's okay now go to the little plasma looking

886
01:00:56,360 --> 01:01:00,320
thing they're all their own videos now yeah they're all like all full videos

887
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:03,600
now some of them are featuring the looping video stuff but a lot of them

888
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:09,600
featured the backgrounds as well like I noticed in happy wedding and irresistible

889
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:13,920
lot they were different and what was the other one that really used a lot of

890
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:18,640
Well, like, La Copa Da Vida has a lot of soccer themes running through it, and the one that

891
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:23,740
Against All Odds is kind of cool, it just has like a very 70s-looking art piece with

892
01:01:23,740 --> 01:01:28,080
a woman and hair blowing around and stuff, so it's kind of neat.

893
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:29,720
I like how they did that with all the different...

894
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:30,720
It's a step in the right direction.

895
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:31,720
Yeah, it's cool.

896
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:32,720
It's cool.

897
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:35,580
It's very interesting that only one song in the whole game has, well, at least that I've

898
01:01:35,580 --> 01:01:39,440
gotten to so far, but I haven't heard of any others, one song in the whole game has an

899
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:43,880
actual music video and that's Get Busy which is probably one of the most

900
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:49,040
well, one of my least favorite songs to play in DDR. Let's put it that way.

901
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:52,680
Not a big Get Busy fan. You know what song that is, right? The reggae one?

902
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:57,360
Not a big fan of Get Busy.

903
01:01:57,360 --> 01:02:01,800
Interesting point though, reading in our chat room over at OrangeLunchRadio.com

904
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:02,420
click on chat

905
01:02:02,420 --> 01:02:05,480
Sakurina says, why did they do that though? Because Kakumei

906
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:09,680
was left as is. So why did they change this but not that?

907
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:13,880
I don't know. Interesting thought. Who cares?

908
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:17,120
Why are you guys putting this much thought into it? Who cares?

909
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:22,120
My thoughts on Extreme- It's not tattooed

910
01:02:22,120 --> 01:02:26,000
on her fucking face, it's just the logo

911
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:30,160
that happens to be on her face. Doesn't mean it's tattooed on her face

912
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:33,320
because who the hell would tattoo a word on their face? That's retarded.

913
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:51,320
I honestly think that they should have left it as Kanji, because with any sort of sense of logic would assume that if you're playing a song with a Japanese title and you see Kanji, that typically it's probably going to be the same thing. So, duh!

914
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:52,320
I know, I know.

915
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:55,320
There has to be somebody pretty stupid in their localization department at Konami.

916
01:02:55,320 --> 01:03:05,320
Snare has a comment there, Palavastian Dances and Chorus has its own full music video too.

917
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:14,320
I say that's kind of borderline because that's a Konami original and all the video is clips from the game that that song is featured in, which is Oz.

918
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:20,320
And Oz, from what I understand, isn't actually going to be coming out here. It's only going to be a Japanese release, I think. I don't remember.

919
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:27,320
It's very interesting that this is the first mix that they've released that isn't an arcade port, basically.

920
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:34,320
So, it kind of has its own video, I guess, although I think it's what game footage would it be.

921
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:37,320
Nah, it's like CG footage. It's like cutscenes, maybe.

922
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:39,320
Well, yeah, cutscenes stuff. That's what I meant.

923
01:03:39,320 --> 01:03:43,320
Let's see. My thoughts on Extreme 2.

924
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:48,700
Jeez, it's very interesting that this is the first mix that they've released that isn't

925
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:51,460
an arcade port, basically.

926
01:03:51,460 --> 01:03:58,620
Like even when you look at Extreme, the last one they released here in the US, Extreme,

927
01:03:58,620 --> 01:04:02,300
even though they radically changed the interface and everything, I think for a lot of people

928
01:04:02,300 --> 01:04:07,940
it was still our version of the port of the Extreme arcade mix, right?

929
01:04:07,940 --> 01:04:12,760
So this is really the first game where there's been no arcade mix to base it off of.

930
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:20,020
So you really, I think, see that evolution from a game that is a translation of an arcade

931
01:04:20,020 --> 01:04:27,100
game for the home mixes, to a game that is specifically made to be played on a home mix.

932
01:04:27,100 --> 01:04:31,480
And I think that's why it centers so strongly around Dance Master Mode, because that's a

933
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:38,360
very single-player, adventure, conquest type, here's a goal, a long-term goal to get from

934
01:04:38,360 --> 01:04:41,560
point A to point B that you can't really do in an arcade game.

935
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:44,560
So I think it's really interesting to kind of see that transition now from...

936
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:50,480
I think this is really the first true transition that we see from DDR as an arcade series to

937
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:54,200
now DDR as a home series with Dance Master Mode.

938
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:56,900
So is that a good thing or a bad thing for the series?

939
01:04:56,900 --> 01:04:57,900
I don't know.

940
01:04:57,900 --> 01:05:03,520
I mean, they kept an arcade-like thing in there still by having the free mode, which,

941
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:07,760
you know, basically has the look and feel of a DDR arcade game, but it's just very interesting

942
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:11,140
that now the focus is on Dance Master Mode, because if you don't play through Dance Master

943
01:05:11,140 --> 01:05:14,700
mode, you're not going to really unlock a lot of songs. So I thought it was very interesting

944
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:23,820
that the only songs that are available at the outset is the licensed songs. So, and

945
01:05:23,820 --> 01:05:28,900
I guess that's a lot of the songs that somebody who doesn't really follow DDR or play a lot

946
01:05:28,900 --> 01:05:32,760
of DDR, those would be the songs that, you know, they would get a kick out of. So that's

947
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:36,760
why that's the initial song list, I'm pretty sure. And it's like all these Konami originals

948
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:40,340
that are hidden in there are just kind of like bonuses for the hardcore people that

949
01:05:40,340 --> 01:05:42,300
that are willing to play through Dance Master Mode.

950
01:05:42,300 --> 01:05:43,860
So it's very interesting.

951
01:05:43,860 --> 01:05:46,460
But I have heard comments from casual players of DDR

952
01:05:46,460 --> 01:05:49,260
that's like, boy, there's really not many songs in this.

953
01:05:49,260 --> 01:05:50,220
And then I'm like, well, you've got

954
01:05:50,220 --> 01:05:51,640
to play through Dance Master Mode.

955
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:54,140
And they're like, oh, I just wanted to get in there

956
01:05:54,140 --> 01:05:55,820
and go into workout mode.

957
01:05:55,820 --> 01:05:59,540
So very interesting.

958
01:05:59,540 --> 01:06:03,540
So I like the game.

959
01:06:03,540 --> 01:06:04,780
It's cool.

960
01:06:04,780 --> 01:06:06,520
It's just different.

961
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:08,260
It's a different direction for the series.

962
01:06:08,260 --> 01:06:09,700
I think I like it, though.

963
01:06:09,700 --> 01:06:13,780
somebody who's a DDR fan. If I was somebody who was buying DDR mixes just to have house

964
01:06:13,780 --> 01:06:18,220
parties though, I'd be kind of ticked off at this mix because it's not, there's not

965
01:06:18,220 --> 01:06:22,580
a lot to it. If you just buy it to play it once in a while, you know, let's get drunk

966
01:06:22,580 --> 01:06:27,660
and play DDR. I'd probably be a little irritated with it because there's not a lot of songs

967
01:06:27,660 --> 01:06:28,660
to choose from.

968
01:06:28,660 --> 01:06:32,780
But even though I'd say the casual person doesn't like playing, you know, all the stuff,

969
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:39,620
I'm sure that they're not that great at DDR. You can play through the, you know, the Mission

970
01:06:39,620 --> 01:06:42,460
mode type stuff you know and you can actually it starts off you know

971
01:06:42,460 --> 01:06:47,620
beginner stuff and goes all the way to really hard so now there you go you can

972
01:06:47,620 --> 01:06:51,060
get better yeah that's true the dance master mode is kind of a way for you to

973
01:06:51,060 --> 01:06:56,060
get better it actually reminded me a lot of 2dx what the hell they call that in

974
01:06:56,060 --> 01:07:01,780
2dx the real mode trial mode drill drill mode thank you drill mode in 2d x6 style

975
01:07:01,780 --> 01:07:04,580
they have that drill mode and I think it was in fifth style as well where you

976
01:07:04,580 --> 01:07:08,500
could you it was like you know play these little sections of songs and meet

977
01:07:08,500 --> 01:07:11,820
these certain qualifications like it's kind of like they took drill mode and

978
01:07:11,820 --> 01:07:15,740
and really changed it and drill mode really helped me get better at 2dx it

979
01:07:15,740 --> 01:07:19,460
really did so it would be very interesting that this dance master mode

980
01:07:19,460 --> 01:07:25,100
could really get you better at DDR but it's still kind of weird to have all the

981
01:07:25,100 --> 01:07:31,100
unlocks only available by playing the dance master mode to death I mean I

982
01:07:31,100 --> 01:07:34,900
there's rumors that there's time releases as well but I don't know I

983
01:07:34,900 --> 01:07:41,900
I don't know. No. I do like the, um, Hidden Roads and stuff like that. Those are pretty cool. Yeah. We're gonna have to find them. Yeah.

984
01:07:41,900 --> 01:07:49,900
I like Spider Stomp. I'm sorry, I haven't played it. I wish I could contribute more to that. That's alright.

985
01:07:49,900 --> 01:07:55,900
Well, you could maybe borrow my copy later this week or something if you wanna check it out. I don't know when I would play it.

986
01:07:55,900 --> 01:08:00,900
Spider Stomp is an excellent game. Just, there's no music, so. It sucks.

987
01:08:00,900 --> 01:08:04,900
I have Puyo Puyo to keep me happy on the maim, so.

988
01:08:04,900 --> 01:08:09,900
But I'm gonna, um, we're, uh, discussing, though, buying a DDR machine.

989
01:08:09,900 --> 01:08:13,900
Speaking of which, um, I'm not sure if you saw that I posted,

990
01:08:13,900 --> 01:08:19,900
I went and opted to get the correct popping music buttons for my popping music controller,

991
01:08:19,900 --> 01:08:21,900
so they're gonna be arcade-style.

992
01:08:21,900 --> 01:08:22,900
Very cool.

993
01:08:22,900 --> 01:08:25,900
Can't wait for that to be done.

994
01:08:25,900 --> 01:08:29,900
I wanna try to build one for myself, like, so that I can actually play on something other than the dinky pad.

995
01:08:29,900 --> 01:08:37,860
that would be easy just the buttons are like 70 bucks cheaper than 400 yeah yeah

996
01:08:37,860 --> 01:08:43,780
you show me how to I'll do it there's a fact I'll email it okay all right we're

And I, for all the glory I,

Okay, we're back here on Orange Lawns Radio.

1033
01:16:32,100 --> 01:16:35,980
people remind me in the future not to reset the router while we're trying to

1034
01:16:35,980 --> 01:16:40,980
broadcast so that Loki can get on our wireless network with the PSP. My bad, my

1035
01:16:40,980 --> 01:16:45,340
bad kids. So since that was kind of my bad and I dropped a lot of you guys

1036
01:16:45,340 --> 01:16:50,340
during the song that like everybody in chat was like OMG waiting for, here it is

1037
01:16:50,340 --> 01:16:57,340
once again one more time seduction

1038
01:17:50,340 --> 01:17:52,340
Hey

1039
01:18:20,340 --> 01:18:40,180
Hello, kids, we're back. Okay, stop complaining, you got to hear a seduction. My bad, people.

1040
01:18:40,180 --> 01:18:46,220
God, we all make mistakes. Some of us more than others, granted, but we all make mistakes.

1041
01:18:46,220 --> 01:18:50,580
Anyway, I'm looking at this really cool new thing that

1042
01:18:50,580 --> 01:18:53,020
Loki was a big part of putting together along with one of our

1043
01:18:53,020 --> 01:18:56,900
other behind-the-scenes people, VX JasonXV, and it's

1044
01:18:56,900 --> 01:18:57,980
very pretty.

1045
01:18:57,980 --> 01:18:59,380
And I think we're going to announce it tonight on the

1046
01:18:59,380 --> 01:19:02,860
podcast. I just have to check with Jason to make sure

1047
01:19:02,860 --> 01:19:04,020

Oh, really?

1065
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:36,180
That was the brand new t-shirt, which says, in the

1066
01:19:36,180 --> 01:19:36,880
courtroom.

1067
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:38,320

1068
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:42,840

1069
01:19:42,840 --> 01:19:44,040
Wow, awesome.

01:19:44,040 --> 01:19:47,320
So somebody is going to win an In The Courtroom shirt, which is...

1071
01:19:47,320 --> 01:19:48,320
What is this?

1072
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:50,200
It's the In The Groove logo, but it says In The Courtroom.

1073
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:51,200
In The Courtroom.

1074
01:19:51,200 --> 01:19:52,200
That's beautiful.

1075
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:53,640
All right.

1076
01:19:53,640 --> 01:19:55,300
So check that out.

1077
01:19:55,300 --> 01:19:59,700
So somebody's going to win the In The Groove thing and the In The Courtroom t-shirt.

1078
01:19:59,700 --> 01:20:03,560
And also, Miklotov wanted to throw some prizes in as well.

1079
01:20:03,560 --> 01:20:04,900
Silent Hill 3 stickers.

1080
01:20:04,900 --> 01:20:07,880
We're going to send the winner a Silent Hill 3 sticker.

1081
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:12,480
Not only the winner, the person who wins the In The Groove haiku contest, but also we're

1082
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:16,440
we're going to send that to the people that won. Fireboma won one of our V-rares, or two

1083
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:20,200
of our V-rares last week. He won an Extreme 2V-rare and a Max 2V-rare. He's going to actually

1084
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:25,120
get a Silent Hill 3 sticker as well, and whoever we draw tonight on the podcast is going to

1085
01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:29,820
get a sticker as well. And Miklotov gave us like 10 stickers, so we're going to just give

1086
01:20:29,820 --> 01:20:33,960
them all away with other prizes that we give out later on throughout this month.

1087
01:20:33,960 --> 01:20:37,820
I'm thinking there will be another contest to go with the announcement that we'll make

1088
01:20:37,820 --> 01:20:39,360
on the podcast later as well.

1089
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:43,140
Super! We got tons of giveaway crap going on. I love it.

1090
01:20:43,140 --> 01:20:46,300
Cleaning house. I love it. We're going to give away stuff. Let's give away the ferret.

1091
01:20:46,300 --> 01:20:50,300
No, no, no. We already gave away a ferret. And there was like three other ones.

1092
01:20:50,300 --> 01:20:54,060
Oh, did we throw them all away? Ferret. Hidden.

1093
01:20:54,060 --> 01:20:57,940
I don't know, yeah. Anyways, they're in my butt.

1094
01:20:57,940 --> 01:21:01,740

1097
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:07,940
Hello!

1098
01:21:07,940 --> 01:21:09,500
You're on Orange Launch Radio.

1099
01:21:09,500 --> 01:21:14,060
Hello, Sephiroth1215 here. Hello, Sephiroth1215, what's on your mind?

1100
01:21:14,060 --> 01:21:17,100
Uh, basically just extreme too, but uh...

1101
01:21:17,100 --> 01:21:19,100
My first thought...

1102
01:21:19,100 --> 01:21:20,940
My first thought was like,

1103
01:21:20,940 --> 01:21:24,540
why was I playing in the groove over the summer?

1104
01:21:24,540 --> 01:21:25,980
I don't know, why?

1105
01:21:25,980 --> 01:21:32,980
Well, I don't know, it just kind of revives the DDR back for me at least.

1106
01:21:35,020 --> 01:21:37,620
Except for the arcades of course, but still.

1107
01:21:37,620 --> 01:21:43,260
Well, you know, I'm the one out of the three of us that doesn't hate on In the Groove

1108
01:21:43,260 --> 01:21:46,720
as much. You know, In the Groove for me was exactly

1109
01:21:46,720 --> 01:21:50,720
like you were kind of referring to here. In the Groove was holding me over between

1110
01:21:50,720 --> 01:21:53,800
real DDR. It's kind of how I felt about In the Groove.

1111
01:21:53,800 --> 01:21:58,760
It's kind of like, well, this is, you know, it's like, it's, it's, I can't believe it's

1112
01:21:58,760 --> 01:22:01,480
not DDR. But, you know, it worked for me, and it kind

1113
01:22:01,480 --> 01:22:04,240
of held me over. So I don't fault anybody for getting in In

1114
01:22:04,240 --> 01:22:05,780
the Groove or whatever. And you know what?

1115
01:22:05,780 --> 01:22:09,040
Even after this, there's still going to be people that are more into In The Groove than

1116
01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:11,040
they are DDR, and you know, that's just fine.

1117
01:22:11,040 --> 01:22:18,880
If you are into running in place for 13 Arrow songs and stuff, hey, hats off to you.

1118
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:23,200
But unfortunately, my personal opinion of In The Groove, and this is my personal opinion

1119
01:22:23,200 --> 01:22:28,160
and whatever, is that unfortunately I think In The Groove was so damn busy making hard

1120
01:22:28,160 --> 01:22:33,560
steps to their songs that they didn't license any good music.

1121
01:22:33,560 --> 01:22:39,320
And to look at DDR Extreme 2's song list, which is pretty phenomenal and really sucks

1122
01:22:39,320 --> 01:22:44,220
the fans' collective cock in every way, I mean honestly, every fan bitching that was

1123
01:22:44,220 --> 01:22:47,700
going on on DDR Freak was really granted with this mix.

1124
01:22:47,700 --> 01:22:51,480
Maybe not everything, but let's face it, the people that were whining and bitching that

1125
01:22:51,480 --> 01:22:53,640
they never got Erotic, they got it.

1126
01:22:53,640 --> 01:22:56,000
The people that were whining and bitching that they were never going to get Cartoon

1127
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:57,440
Heroes, they got it.

1128
01:22:57,440 --> 01:23:01,040
The people that were bitching they were never going to get Sakura and Daikonkai, they got

1129
01:23:01,040 --> 01:23:06,920
got it. I'll be a little bit butchered, but they got it. So this mix really delivered

1130
01:23:06,920 --> 01:23:12,840
to the fans in every way, I think. I don't know. I'm sorry, it's your call, not my monologue.

1131
01:23:12,840 --> 01:23:18,040
I keep cutting you off. What are your other thoughts on Extreme?

1132
01:23:18,040 --> 01:23:22,480
Well, first of all, yeah. I was really pissed about the Injection of Love thing. Because

1133
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:27,320
it came up randomly and I was happy, I was excited. I'm like, oh, what's Hina mean? And

1134
01:23:27,320 --> 01:23:31,320
all the lyrics are just gone, which has kind of ruined the song.

1135
01:23:31,320 --> 01:23:35,320
I like how, I think somebody on Freak put it this way, is that somebody said,

1136
01:23:35,320 --> 01:23:39,320
imagine you've never heard the 2DX Red version, and I realize it's hard to do

1137
01:23:39,320 --> 01:23:43,320
because you have heard the 2DX Red version, but imagine for a minute you haven't heard the 2DX Red version,

1138
01:23:43,320 --> 01:23:47,320
as a standalone song, it's not that bad.

1139
01:23:47,320 --> 01:23:51,320
There's been worse songs in DDR, although I agree it's a little disappointing for the

1140
01:23:51,320 --> 01:23:55,320
lyrics to be cut out of the song, but, you know, there's, all I can tell you is that there's

1141
01:23:55,320 --> 01:23:59,280
a reason for everything so there's probably a really good reason why it

1142
01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:03,440
turned out the way it did. Well if it's a reason for censoring I think it's poor

1143
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:08,440
because some of the other songs they're like get busy or even the erotic song I

1144
01:24:08,440 --> 01:24:12,320
mean I thought they weren't gonna censor anything after that since they got an E10 rating. Think of it

1145
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:16,000
this way though maybe it wasn't done for censoring everybody's assuming it was

1146
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:23,640
done for censoring but what if it wasn't? We don't really know so just

1147
01:24:23,640 --> 01:24:29,400
I'm just hoping maybe I'll put in like UltraMix 3 or something, since they're probably better

1148
01:24:29,400 --> 01:24:30,400
on that.

1149
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:35,080
Which kind of reminds me, the Quest Mode in UltraMix 3 is probably going to be similar

1150
01:24:35,080 --> 01:24:37,200
in some sort to this Mission Mode.

1151
01:24:37,200 --> 01:24:41,560
I was kind of wondering, I kind of thought about that too, that you know, I'm wondering

1152
01:24:41,560 --> 01:24:45,480
if the Quest Mode in UltraMix 3 is going to be the very central part of the game, such

1153
01:24:45,480 --> 01:24:52,480
as Dance Master Mode was in this Dance Dance Extreme 2, but I don't think it will be, because

1154
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:57,240
honestly from what I played at E3, and granted, a lot can change from E3 to the home release

1155
01:24:57,240 --> 01:25:04,200
because UltraMix II at last year's E3 sucked humongous, hairy, extra-for-love-and-balls,

1156
01:25:04,200 --> 01:25:13,040
okay? But the version that they ended up releasing is probably one of the best DDR mixes that

1157
01:25:13,040 --> 01:25:17,340
they've ever put out, and in my opinion, I think the song list in UltraMix II is better

1158
01:25:17,340 --> 01:25:20,960
than Extreme II's, but I realize, you know, not everybody shares the same opinion. But

1159
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:24,660
but Ultramix 2 is phenomenal when they released it. But, Ultramix 3 at E3 this year, I can

1160
01:25:24,660 --> 01:25:28,340
tell you, really didn't feel that much different from Ultramix 2. It was just Ultramix 2 with

1161
01:25:28,340 --> 01:25:32,820
new songs thrown in, and hey, this new little quest mode. So, I don't know.

1162
01:25:32,820 --> 01:25:39,420
Well yeah, I think it was explained before, is quest mode is probably going to be like

1163
01:25:39,420 --> 01:25:43,780
that mode in Virtua Fighter IV Evolution. Where you just go around different arcades

1164
01:25:43,780 --> 01:25:49,260
and fight people. Virtual Fighter IV Evolution, I didn't really

1165
01:25:49,260 --> 01:25:52,260
I didn't really play the Virtua Fighter. Oh, Jamie's making the gag face. I didn't really play Virtua Fighter.

1166
01:25:52,260 --> 01:25:54,260
I hate Virtua Fighter.

1167
01:25:54,260 --> 01:25:58,260
Oh. Sorry, we don't catch the reference because I don't really play a lot of fighting games.

1168
01:25:58,260 --> 01:26:01,260
I saw it. It was pretty, but I don't like Virtua Fighter.

1169
01:26:01,260 --> 01:26:03,260
What was the last fighting game I really liked? Oh, Capcom vs. SNK 2.

1170
01:26:03,260 --> 01:26:05,260
Tekken 5.

1171
01:26:05,260 --> 01:26:07,260
Tekken was okay.

1172
01:26:07,260 --> 01:26:13,260
Anyway, I need to get to some other calls, but do you have any other thoughts on DDR Extreme 2?

1173
01:26:13,260 --> 01:26:16,260
Not really. I think most people should buy it now.

1174
01:26:16,260 --> 01:26:19,260
If you're a fan of DDR, you need to have this game, period.

1175
01:26:19,260 --> 01:26:22,260
If you're a fan of music games, you need to have this game, period.

1176
01:26:22,260 --> 01:26:26,260
If you're a casual, hey, I like to play DDR when I'm drunk,

1177
01:26:26,260 --> 01:26:29,260
you're probably not listening to this show, for one.

1178
01:26:29,260 --> 01:26:33,260
But if that does happen to be you, you may not be so into this mix.

1179
01:26:33,260 --> 01:26:35,260
I would recommend if you're going to start somewhere,

1180
01:26:35,260 --> 01:26:37,260
like if you're a brand new, I'm brand new to DDR,

1181
01:26:37,260 --> 01:26:39,260
I want to start somewhere in the series,

1182
01:26:39,260 --> 01:26:42,260
I actually think Max 2 is the place to start for me.

1183
01:26:42,260 --> 01:26:51,260
but I don't know, it's a toss up. It's tough. One other thing I want to ask you, Sephiroth1215,

1184
01:26:51,260 --> 01:26:54,300
what do you think about the Pump It Up custom soundtrack feature?

1185
01:26:54,300 --> 01:27:02,460
All right, I guess it's okay. I mean, it's not something I would probably use, but I

1186
01:27:02,460 --> 01:27:08,740
mean, still, there's still a possibility it's going to be the next UltraMix, or even so.

1187
01:27:08,740 --> 01:27:14,660
I mean, they said the 360, if it goes onto the 360, every 360 game is going to use the

1188
01:27:14,660 --> 01:27:17,900
custom soundtrack feature. So I'm sure they're going to have to throw it in somehow.

1189
01:27:17,900 --> 01:27:21,020
Really? I didn't know about that, that every game was supposed to use the custom soundtrack

1190
01:27:21,020 --> 01:27:26,820
feature. That's going to be kind of cool. Okay. Well, we'll see. I don't see how we

1191
01:27:26,820 --> 01:27:32,580
can't, if DDR is selling as well as everybody says it is, I say UltraMix or some version

1192
01:27:32,580 --> 01:27:41,660
of Xbox DDR on the 360 is inevitable. So maybe Konami now has something to dare to achieve

1193
01:27:41,660 --> 01:27:43,780
in their Xbox series. Who knows? We'll see.

1194
01:27:43,780 --> 01:27:49,660
Alright, well we're going to let you go. I'm going to get to another call, but have a good

1195
01:27:49,660 --> 01:27:50,660
night and thanks for calling, alright?

1196
01:27:50,660 --> 01:27:51,660
Alright, you too.

1197
01:27:51,660 --> 01:27:52,660
Alright, take care.

1198
01:27:52,660 --> 01:27:53,660
Bye.

1199
01:27:53,660 --> 01:27:54,660
Bye-bye.

1200
01:27:54,660 --> 01:27:59,060
Let's go to another call. Is it loud enough in the studio for you, Dorksucker, or do I

1201
01:27:59,060 --> 01:28:00,060
need to turn it up a little bit?

1202
01:28:00,060 --> 01:28:01,060
I couldn't hear it.

1203
01:28:01,060 --> 01:28:02,060
I'm sorry.

1204
01:28:02,060 --> 01:28:05,820
a little let me turn it up a little bit for you. Alright, let's go to another call. I'm

1205
01:28:05,820 --> 01:28:10,700
going to take, I don't think we've heard from this one in a while. Hello, you're on Orange

1206
01:28:10,700 --> 01:28:18,020
Lawn's radio. Hello. Hello, yes, you're on Orange Lawn's radio. Hey, this is Dark Knight.

1207
01:28:18,020 --> 01:28:27,260
Hey, Dark Knight, how you doing? Hello. Hey. What about the online mode on DDR EX2? Yeah,

1208
01:28:27,260 --> 01:28:30,220
we didn't talk a lot about online mode. I haven't played a whole lot of it, but what's

1209
01:28:30,220 --> 01:28:31,220
What's up?

1210
01:28:31,220 --> 01:28:32,220
I tried it.

1211
01:28:32,220 --> 01:28:38,220
It has a major flaw, and that is you cannot pick your opponent, nor can you pick the song

1212
01:28:38,220 --> 01:28:41,820
to play against, to play against with them.

1213
01:28:41,820 --> 01:28:42,820
That's kind of weird.

1214
01:28:42,820 --> 01:28:47,700
I mean, I guess, yeah, it's kind of one of those things where, well, it's DDR's first

1215
01:28:47,700 --> 01:28:53,740
adventures into the PlayStation Online realm, which, from what I understand, is just not,

1216
01:28:53,740 --> 01:28:58,940
well, you know, from a player perspective, the Sony Online network is just not as good

1217
01:28:58,940 --> 01:28:59,940
as Xbox Live.

1218
01:28:59,940 --> 01:29:03,180
I mean, it's just not as set up as well as Xbox Live is.

1219
01:29:03,180 --> 01:29:05,820
So I'm kind of not surprised that the online features aren't as good.

1220
01:29:05,820 --> 01:29:09,740
But yeah, that is kind of weird that you can't even pick your song, of all things.

1221
01:29:09,740 --> 01:29:11,220
Yeah, but I mean, it was OK.

1222
01:29:11,220 --> 01:29:12,900
But as far as the game play went, it was all right.

1223
01:29:12,900 --> 01:29:14,180
It was pretty synced up.

1224
01:29:14,180 --> 01:29:15,340
Really?

1225
01:29:15,340 --> 01:29:17,940
Yeah, it was pretty synced up when I played my match.

1226
01:29:17,940 --> 01:29:19,460
It was synced with the song I was playing.

1227
01:29:19,460 --> 01:29:22,820
I'm going to have to get on there and kick some ass on DER.

1228
01:29:22,820 --> 01:29:26,540
Can you tell if people are using a controller or not?

1229
01:29:26,540 --> 01:29:28,300
No, you really can't.

1230
01:29:28,300 --> 01:29:28,800
Excellent.

1231
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:29,800
I'm a button, button master.

1232
01:29:29,800 --> 01:29:30,800
I'm going to get on there and kick some butt.

1233
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:39,800
I think I'll play against somebody and keep playing on Heavy, and I killed him.

1234
01:29:39,800 --> 01:29:40,800
Awesome.

1235
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:46,800
See, I feel kind of bad for admitting to that, but at the same time, you know they're all

1236
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:48,400
playing on controller.

1237
01:29:48,400 --> 01:29:50,280
You know they're all...

1238
01:29:50,280 --> 01:29:54,400
Maybe there's one or two guys out there playing on a dance pad on Heavy, and props to you

1239
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:57,880
guys for having the guts to do it, but come on.

1240
01:29:57,880 --> 01:30:02,640
all playing on controller. Especially on the soft pad, that's impossible to play heavy

1241
01:30:02,640 --> 01:30:07,340
on the soft pad. It is. That's my problem is that honestly it's too hard to play. When

1242
01:30:07,340 --> 01:30:11,660
you're playing for ranking as well, certainly, I have this problem on Xbox Live as well is

1243
01:30:11,660 --> 01:30:16,860
that I have a really hard time playing heavy matches on a dance pad because I have problems

1244
01:30:16,860 --> 01:30:23,220
hitting my down arrow a lot of times. So I do not like playing heavy songs. I will still

1245
01:30:23,220 --> 01:30:27,300
play light and standard songs on a dance pad against someone on a controller

1246
01:30:27,300 --> 01:30:31,020
because on Xbox you can see what they're using. But if they're using a control...

1247
01:30:31,020 --> 01:30:36,740
whoa we just had a major net split on IRC and I think I split from the rest of

1248
01:30:36,740 --> 01:30:39,620
the chat room but hopefully they'll reconnect soon. Anyway just want to give

1249
01:30:39,620 --> 01:30:44,900
that update. Yeah I mean like I said I mean other than that the normal mode

1250
01:30:44,900 --> 01:30:48,860
yeah there's match mode pretty good fast way to open the songs a little more

1251
01:30:48,860 --> 01:30:55,460
quicker. But at the same time though, it depends on the player's skill on a home pad because

1252
01:30:55,460 --> 01:31:01,100
right now I'm just working on the B-chords right now. I ain't even hit the hard levels

1253
01:31:01,100 --> 01:31:02,100
yet.

1254
01:31:02,100 --> 01:31:06,260
I've actually been pretty good about sticking to playing Dance Master mode strictly on a

1255
01:31:06,260 --> 01:31:11,440
dance pad because I want to get back into actively playing DDR. When I say actively

1256
01:31:11,440 --> 01:31:16,120
meaning like I'm actually exercising by doing it, what little I will be able to exercise

1257
01:31:16,120 --> 01:31:20,300
playing DDR, so I've been actually doing it on the S-FAB, but even there's that one

1258
01:31:20,300 --> 01:31:24,540
occasional mission that I just cannot do without the controller, and those are, the

1259
01:31:24,540 --> 01:31:27,820
one for me that I have to use a controller for is the one where, and you

1260
01:31:27,820 --> 01:31:30,580
probably haven't seen these yet, but you'll see these when you get into D, is

1261
01:31:30,580 --> 01:31:36,420
that there'll be some missions that say, step on a hundred and fifty arrows, but

1262
01:31:36,420 --> 01:31:41,220
not any of the arrows that are actually in the step chart. If you step on one of

1263
01:31:41,220 --> 01:31:44,140
them, if you step on one of the arrows that are actually in the step chart, you

1264
01:31:44,140 --> 01:31:49,300
lose I think it's one somebody said I think so get FAQ say if you step on the

1265
01:31:49,300 --> 01:31:53,740
down arrows you will fail there's another yes there's another mission like

1266
01:31:53,740 --> 01:31:56,780
that too where you can't step on any down arrows and it's really hard to do

1267
01:31:56,780 --> 01:32:00,500
like some of that stuff is just super I could not do I tried doing that mission

1268
01:32:00,500 --> 01:32:04,960
on a dance pad I could not get 150 notes to register with my feet so I think one

1269
01:32:04,960 --> 01:32:09,340
song where you have to typically play bad to pass yeah there's there's a whole

1270
01:32:09,340 --> 01:32:13,600
bunch of weird stuff there in dance master mode so I was like what do I have

1271
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:16,400
I'm going to literally get a D to set this up.

1272
01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:17,560
Okay, I'll just step off.

1273
01:32:17,560 --> 01:32:19,080
It's good attack.

1274
01:32:19,080 --> 01:32:20,560
One other thing I want to ask you, Dark Knight,

1275
01:32:20,560 --> 01:32:21,400
before we go to another call,

1276
01:32:21,400 --> 01:32:23,760
what do you think about the Pump It Up thing,

1277
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:27,400
the custom soundtrack thing on Pump It Up?

1278
01:32:27,400 --> 01:32:28,560
That's just like a major,

1279
01:32:28,560 --> 01:32:31,680
maybe it might be a major coke of IE hot coffee,

1280
01:32:31,680 --> 01:32:33,520
but A, to eat his own.

1281
01:32:35,440 --> 01:32:37,400
So are you saying that kids everywhere now

1282
01:32:37,400 --> 01:32:41,480
can make step files to porn soundtracks, or?

1283
01:32:41,480 --> 01:32:48,480
The only thing I can think of though, Xbox Live you can't upload.

1284
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:50,480
Can you?

1285
01:32:50,480 --> 01:32:52,480
I think.

1286
01:32:52,480 --> 01:32:54,480
How? I don't know how to do it.

1287
01:32:54,480 --> 01:33:00,480
You can upload if the game allows it, but Pump It Up doesn't allow it.

1288
01:33:00,480 --> 01:33:04,480
Ultra Mix 2 does though.

1289
01:33:04,480 --> 01:33:05,480
Does?

1290
01:33:05,480 --> 01:33:07,480
Yeah, Ultra Mix 2 does.

1291
01:33:07,480 --> 01:33:11,980
Maybe somebody in Mike can find a code for it.

1292
01:33:11,980 --> 01:33:13,480
You never know. You never know what might happen.

1293
01:33:13,480 --> 01:33:20,980
If Microsoft really does plan on setting up this big music store for their 360 that's going to compete with iTunes or whatever,

1294
01:33:20,980 --> 01:33:24,980
which is a big rumor, they're going to set up their own music store to compete with iTunes via the 360,

1295
01:33:24,980 --> 01:33:28,980
wouldn't that be interesting that not only could you download the song,

1296
01:33:28,980 --> 01:33:33,980
but then you could also have, hey, you could have this fan step chart in DDR that you download with it.

1297
01:33:33,980 --> 01:33:38,080
I don't know that would be kind of cheesy, but I could see it happening. I don't know might be a way to do it

1298
01:33:38,660 --> 01:33:42,280
All right, anyway. We're gonna let you go see what we can get you another call

1299
01:33:42,280 --> 01:33:46,820
But thank you so much for calling in tonight and have a good one all right night late up

1300
01:33:47,460 --> 01:33:50,220
All right, let's go to another call one more guys before break

1301
01:33:51,620 --> 01:33:56,140
Hello, you're on orange on the radio. Hey, what's up is Ron. Hello Ron channel. Hello

1302
01:33:56,660 --> 01:34:02,200
Hey, oh, what's up? Hey, not not too much. Just you know been playing the hell out of extreme, too

1303
01:34:02,200 --> 01:34:08,200
I've been playing the older mixes. As soon as I get a job, I'll pick up Extreme 2 and have fun with that.

1304
01:34:08,200 --> 01:34:11,200
Okay, so you're still on the older mixes. That's alright.

1305
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:16,200
Yeah, I'm following what's going on. Everybody's bitching this song because I did it.

1306
01:34:16,200 --> 01:34:21,200
Look, if you want this song that badly, buy the import or shut the fuck up.

1307
01:34:21,200 --> 01:34:29,200
Yeah, I don't see... People are always going to find something to complain about. That's just inevitable.

1308
01:34:29,200 --> 01:34:32,200
But this mix is pretty solid, honestly.

1309
01:34:32,200 --> 01:34:36,200
Overall, you can't make people happy. You know, that's all it is.

1310
01:34:36,200 --> 01:34:38,200
That's true.

1311
01:34:38,200 --> 01:34:43,200
But let's take a little step from DDL. Let's do a little power power.

1312
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:47,200
In case you haven't heard, I went to the Yoko Ishida concert in New York City today.

1313
01:34:47,200 --> 01:34:49,200
Ah! How was that?

1314
01:34:49,200 --> 01:34:53,200
It was awesome. I'm posting pictures from the concert.

1315
01:34:53,200 --> 01:34:55,200
It was a free concert at the Manhattan Mall.

1316
01:34:55,200 --> 01:34:59,440
It took about 100 pictures, and if you go through the pictures, you'll see a lot of

1317
01:34:59,440 --> 01:35:01,640
people up there power powering as well.

1318
01:35:01,640 --> 01:35:03,240
Oh, that is so gay.

1319
01:35:03,240 --> 01:35:04,240
No, that's cool.

1320
01:35:04,240 --> 01:35:05,240
No, it's great.

1321
01:35:05,240 --> 01:35:08,440
I didn't power power because I was too busy taking pictures and stuff.

1322
01:35:08,440 --> 01:35:09,440
Uh-huh.

1323
01:35:09,440 --> 01:35:14,200
I had fun, but one thing that always pisses me off is the fact that when they don't have

1324
01:35:14,200 --> 01:35:19,160
any type of anime or video game gathering or whatever, you have to have one fanboy that

1325
01:35:19,160 --> 01:35:20,160
pisses you off.

1326
01:35:20,160 --> 01:35:23,960
You just want to strangle him, and your friends are like, no, don't.

1327
01:35:23,960 --> 01:35:27,920
not worth it. I'm looking at some of these pictures very randomly on the site. Oh, don't

1328
01:35:27,920 --> 01:35:33,960
they look cute? You were up near the front, weren't you? Yeah. If you look at this one

1329
01:35:33,960 --> 01:35:41,360
picture I'm about to post, this is when I got my Power Power Mix CDs signed and stuff

1330
01:35:41,360 --> 01:35:46,520
like that. All right on. Go you. And the one before that's my friend Aaron. We pushed him

1331
01:35:46,520 --> 01:35:50,600
onto the stage so he could do Power Power as well. How many people were at this thing?

1332
01:35:50,600 --> 01:35:58,600
Okay, there was about 40 people downstairs. Now, everybody around the first and second floors is about 100 or so.

1333
01:35:58,600 --> 01:36:10,600
I mean, it was just so awesome. Words you really can't describe per se, but I did find somebody that videotaped it, so I'm trying to get a copy of the footage of the concert.

1334
01:36:10,600 --> 01:36:14,600
Oh, yeah, I remember that guy. I met that guy when I was in Jersey.

1335
01:36:14,600 --> 01:36:17,600
Yeah, Aaron. The fanboy.

1336
01:36:17,600 --> 01:36:21,600
Alrighty. Awesome. He looks very happy to be with those three sexy ladies there.

1337
01:36:21,600 --> 01:36:23,600
Awesome. Awesome.

1338
01:36:23,600 --> 01:36:30,600
What we did was after we took the pictures, we went back and wished Yoko Ishida a happy birthday because her birthday is this Friday.

1339
01:36:30,600 --> 01:36:31,600
Oh, right on.

1340
01:36:31,600 --> 01:36:40,600
And I also found out that supposedly she's going to be on live with Regis and Kathy Lee. No, Regis and Kelly doing Power Power this Friday.

1341
01:36:40,600 --> 01:36:41,600
No way.

1342
01:36:41,600 --> 01:36:42,600
Way.

1343
01:36:42,600 --> 01:36:43,600
That's gonna be awesome.

1344
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:45,600
That's what I've heard.

1345
01:36:45,600 --> 01:36:49,800
Big props to Ron-chan, by the way, because that's the first time in about five years

1346
01:36:49,800 --> 01:36:53,760
where I said, no way, and then I got the response, way.

1347
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:58,000
But it's the little things in life that amuse me.

1348
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:01,720
That's great that they're going to do some Para-para on Regis and Kelly, because you

1349
01:37:01,720 --> 01:37:02,720
know what?

1350
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:05,640
The audience for Regis and Kelly is like my grandma, okay?

1351
01:37:05,640 --> 01:37:11,040
So they're so not going to get it, but I'm so going to TiVo that.

1352
01:37:11,040 --> 01:37:12,040
Wow.

1353
01:37:12,040 --> 01:37:14,400
Is there a TiVo that too?

1354
01:37:14,400 --> 01:37:17,720
Just like that, there's a comment in the chatroom, somebody needs to TiVo that.

1355
01:37:17,720 --> 01:37:19,600
I will TiVo it.

1356
01:37:19,600 --> 01:37:23,080
Or Comcast ghetto knockoff TiVo, whatever they call it.

1357
01:37:23,080 --> 01:37:24,080
I will...

1358
01:37:24,080 --> 01:37:27,120
You do realize, somebody's going to TiVo it, and it's going to end up on a torrent site

1359
01:37:27,120 --> 01:37:28,120
somewhere.

1360
01:37:28,120 --> 01:37:29,120
Good, because we need to do...

1361
01:37:29,120 --> 01:37:33,400
We haven't done movie time on Orange Lounge Radio in like months, so we need a good thing

1362
01:37:33,400 --> 01:37:35,200
to skewer, so I'm excited.

1363
01:37:35,200 --> 01:37:38,520
Oh, speaking of movies, one of my friends saw Serenity.

1364
01:37:38,520 --> 01:37:39,520
This is what he said.

1365
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:40,520
Yeah?

1366
01:37:40,520 --> 01:37:44,080
I liked Serenity when it was called Outlaw Star.

1367
01:37:44,080 --> 01:37:49,280
I've heard people complaining that it's way too similar to certain animes out there.

1368
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:51,280
Here comes X to purr the weed and whore.

1369
01:37:51,280 --> 01:37:52,280
Uh-oh.

1370
01:37:52,280 --> 01:37:53,280
What?

1371
01:37:53,280 --> 01:37:56,280
I just grabbed the mic.

1372
01:37:56,280 --> 01:37:57,280
Serenity?

1373
01:37:57,280 --> 01:38:00,980
I just grabbed Serenity so I automatically started for the mic.

1374
01:38:00,980 --> 01:38:03,200
Is it a rip-off of popular animes?

1375
01:38:03,200 --> 01:38:07,240
I have no clue because I don't watch anime.

1376
01:38:07,240 --> 01:38:10,680
But if it is, it's really good and I recommend it.

1377
01:38:10,680 --> 01:38:12,320
Watch your nearest theater.

1378
01:38:12,320 --> 01:38:17,320
I saw the first episode of Buffy and I was like, this is a rip-devil-hunting orko.

1379
01:38:17,320 --> 01:38:22,320
Well, I don't know. I guess it happens. What can you say?

1380
01:38:22,320 --> 01:38:29,320
You know, maybe he was indirectly inspired. Maybe it's a fancy coincidence. I don't know.

1381
01:38:29,320 --> 01:38:36,320
But there was the whole show that preceded it, so it's kind of tough to decide that your movie is going to rip it off after the fact.

1382
01:38:36,320 --> 01:38:40,320
Well, from what I understand, the series ripped off Outlaw Star and Cowboy Bebop.

1383
01:38:40,320 --> 01:38:47,240
Every good everybody steals from somebody. Yeah, that is true. Imitation is the finest form of flattery, right? Mm-hmm

1384
01:38:48,280 --> 01:38:53,280
All right, we're gonna go ahead and let you go Ron Chan, so thank you so much for calling in. Okay. Peace

1385
01:38:53,280 --> 01:39:00,320
Take care fellas. Peace y'all. Have a good one. Super. Bye Dark Sakura. She actually had to run out to take a call real quick

1386
01:39:00,320 --> 01:39:02,320
She said bye.

1387
01:39:02,480 --> 01:39:04,480
Later

1388
01:39:04,720 --> 01:39:08,920
All right, we're gonna go to one more call here since I don't want to get into cage match with that Dark Sakura so

1389
01:39:08,920 --> 01:39:12,920
So, our old buddy Zaku is hammering the line.

1390
01:39:12,920 --> 01:39:14,920
Yeah, as always.

1391
01:39:14,920 --> 01:39:16,920
As always. What's on your mind?

1392
01:39:16,920 --> 01:39:17,920
Keep it!

1393
01:39:17,920 --> 01:39:22,920
I know you've got an opinion. If anybody's got an opinion on Xtreme 2, I know you've got one, so what is it?

1394
01:39:22,920 --> 01:39:29,920
Well, first of all, since I'm too broke to buy me a PS2, thus I don't have the game,

1395
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:36,920
but I have been hearing around that it's pretty good that people, especially within the city,

1396
01:39:36,920 --> 01:39:41,280
There's a lot of city players I heard who are actually playing the game and actually

1397
01:39:41,280 --> 01:39:45,440
going through the hell of Dance Master Mode.

1398
01:39:45,440 --> 01:39:47,560
What do you think about Dance Master Mode?

1399
01:39:47,560 --> 01:39:51,780
Is it appropriate for DDR on a home mix, or should they have just stuck to the, make it

1400
01:39:51,780 --> 01:39:53,720
look like the arcade?

1401
01:39:53,720 --> 01:39:58,120
In other words, it only applies to one type of player, like a hardcore person, like a

1402
01:39:58,120 --> 01:40:04,360
seasoned DDR player, not like a newbie who basically hasn't heard a damn thing about

1403
01:40:04,360 --> 01:40:05,360
it.

1404
01:40:05,360 --> 01:40:11,500
They'll be shocked when they only see like what, 20, 25 songs in free mode when they

1405
01:40:11,500 --> 01:40:16,020
have like shitloads more, they have to literally put effort into getting them.

1406
01:40:16,020 --> 01:40:20,720
But I mean, is Dance Master Mode really that hard in the beginning anyway?

1407
01:40:20,720 --> 01:40:21,720
It depends.

1408
01:40:21,720 --> 01:40:26,900
I mean, from what I'm hearing, like certain challenges where you can't step on the original

1409
01:40:26,900 --> 01:40:31,220
arrows or you can't step on a particular arrow, which is basically an in-the-group rip-off

1410
01:40:31,220 --> 01:40:32,220
if you ask me.

1411
01:40:32,220 --> 01:40:33,700
Those, well now, wait a minute.

1412
01:40:33,700 --> 01:40:39,100
Like mines? Come on, you gotta admit, Konami's trying to play the mine cart in this one.

1413
01:40:39,100 --> 01:40:47,100
But Poison Arrows existed in UltraMix before that and other mission modes, so just like

1414
01:40:47,100 --> 01:40:51,140
when, you know, I could say that In the Groove ripped off the multiple arrow idea from either

1415
01:40:51,140 --> 01:40:54,980
Pump It Up or DDR Solo, both of all had multiple arrows, so it's, you know.

1416
01:40:54,980 --> 01:40:58,020
Yeah, but not more than two, how about more than two at the same time?

1417
01:40:58,020 --> 01:41:06,020
Actually, DDR Dancing Stage, or DDR First Mix, one of the songs that was supposed to be on there, had three arrows at one time.

1418
01:41:06,020 --> 01:41:07,020
But...

1419
01:41:07,020 --> 01:41:13,020
So, okay, the step charts for Dropout Maniac on DDR Solo has four. You have to hit four at once.

1420
01:41:13,020 --> 01:41:20,020
Hmm. All right. Anyways, MTV2 had their video mods thing on Friday.

1421
01:41:20,020 --> 01:41:27,020
How did that go? I couldn't catch the beginning, though, so I can't vouch for what they had for DDR Extreme 2.

1422
01:41:27,020 --> 01:41:33,020
So, you know, they're gonna air it again in about two and a half hours from now East Coast time.

1423
01:41:33,020 --> 01:41:38,020
So, I'll probably see that beginning part when they had it.

1424
01:41:38,020 --> 01:41:43,020
What the hell was the DDR reference on this thing?

1425
01:41:43,020 --> 01:41:47,020
I don't know because I couldn't catch the beginning of the video.

1426
01:41:47,020 --> 01:41:48,020
What good are you?

1427
01:41:48,020 --> 01:41:49,020
I'm just kidding.

1428
01:41:49,020 --> 01:41:54,220
I'm just kidding. As I said, you know, they're going to air it again in like 1.30 tonight,

1429
01:41:54,220 --> 01:41:59,380
so obviously I'm going to be able to stay up to see it, so I can't vouch for it now.

1430
01:41:59,380 --> 01:42:05,660
I'll set the TiVo. So we'll see. I wish I had a TiVo, but...

1431
01:42:05,660 --> 01:42:11,300
Besides... Zaku, I want to know your thoughts on the Pump It Up thing, the custom soundtrack.

1432
01:42:11,300 --> 01:42:17,820
Well, let me... obviously this is no surprise. Xbox is pretty much sold, you know, you could

1433
01:42:17,820 --> 01:42:22,620
You pretty much sell an Xbox on the whole idea of basically playing games with your

1434
01:42:22,620 --> 01:42:23,620
own tracks.

1435
01:42:23,620 --> 01:42:25,420
Except none of them use it.

1436
01:42:25,420 --> 01:42:26,420
Yes.

1437
01:42:26,420 --> 01:42:30,660
Well, but I've seen a lot of, there's some folks I know that actually use it in certain

1438
01:42:30,660 --> 01:42:31,660
games.

1439
01:42:31,660 --> 01:42:35,900
But anyways, the whole thing, it's too basic in other words.

1440
01:42:35,900 --> 01:42:40,580
Because it's not a robust step editor in my opinion.

1441
01:42:40,580 --> 01:42:45,680
You need something obviously to find the BPM, but also something to calculate the gap.

1442
01:42:45,680 --> 01:42:51,840
And something to assist you, to take every measure, so that way you can make your song

1443
01:42:51,840 --> 01:42:53,440
sync up.

1444
01:42:53,440 --> 01:42:57,240
And so it doesn't feel robust.

1445
01:42:57,240 --> 01:43:02,880
Well you gotta check out the pump editor though, it's very similar to a DDR editor, but just

1446
01:43:02,880 --> 01:43:05,680
with some extra stuff there to support the custom soundtrack.

1447
01:43:05,680 --> 01:43:06,680
Alright.

1448
01:43:06,680 --> 01:43:07,680
Yeah.

1449
01:43:07,680 --> 01:43:11,600
Zaku, I'm hanging up on you now, we got a cage match to get to.

1450
01:43:11,600 --> 01:43:13,120
Alright, later man.

1451
01:43:13,120 --> 01:43:14,120
Take care.

1452
01:43:14,120 --> 01:43:15,120
Bye.

1453
01:43:15,120 --> 01:43:20,120
Alright, we're going to get into the Orange Lounge Cage Match here momentarily there.

1454
01:43:20,120 --> 01:43:22,120
Interesting calls tonight, yeah?

1455
01:43:22,120 --> 01:43:29,120
Alright, I was trying to think if there's any other things, little pieces of news I wanted to get to.

1456
01:43:29,120 --> 01:43:37,120
I guess not, so why don't we get into the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match, which I'm so not set up for, by the way.

1457
01:43:37,120 --> 01:43:40,120
Actually, I need somebody to stretch some time, because I'm so not set up for tonight's event.

1458
01:43:40,120 --> 01:43:44,120
The question is, has anyone actually played the Karaoke Revolution Party demo yet?

1459
01:43:44,120 --> 01:43:50,120
I haven't. No, I haven't because I can't find my microphone.

1460
01:43:50,120 --> 01:43:52,120
Jamie doesn't sing in public.

1461
01:43:52,120 --> 01:43:56,120
Well, you can play in the privacy of your own home, if you so choose.

1462
01:43:56,120 --> 01:44:02,120
I don't sing outside of my car.

1463
01:44:02,120 --> 01:44:05,120
I would play it if it had gorillas.

1464
01:44:05,120 --> 01:44:08,120
Karaoke Revolution, Automobile Edition.

1465
01:44:08,120 --> 01:44:10,120
Sing in your car?

1466
01:44:10,120 --> 01:44:11,120
Karaoke Revolution for your cell phone, maybe?

1467
01:44:11,120 --> 01:44:17,120
In fact, that's what they should have as one of the stages, you know, you're singing in your car or you're singing in your shower.

1468
01:44:17,120 --> 01:44:24,120
Oh yeah, because like how you sing in different locations, like you know, you're at the country bar and then you're at the Super Bowl or whatever it's called.

1469
01:44:24,120 --> 01:44:32,120
They should have the first stage that you're singing on the toilet or something.

1470
01:44:32,120 --> 01:44:39,120
They need to have like the toys level where you're in the bathroom at the toys factory from toys singing in the corner.

1471
01:44:39,120 --> 01:44:45,420
awesome I love that movie all right I'm ready for the cage matcher you guys yeah

1472
01:44:45,420 --> 01:44:49,320
sure all right let's do it let's get into tonight's orange lounge radio cage

1473
01:44:49,320 --> 01:44:55,200
match the way the cage match works boys and girls we're gonna put three songs in

1474
01:44:55,200 --> 01:44:58,760
and they're gonna do battle head-to-head against each other and you guys will

1475
01:44:58,760 --> 01:45:02,720
vote for your favorite and the winning song goes into rotation all week long on

1476
01:45:02,720 --> 01:45:07,360
orange lounge radios for Monte music and video game music program which plays 24

1477
01:45:07,360 --> 01:45:11,640
hours a day, seven days a week on this station when we're not here. It's your guys' vote

1478
01:45:11,640 --> 01:45:17,860
that makes or breaks the cage match. The rules for how a song gets put in cage match is we

1479
01:45:17,860 --> 01:45:20,760
have to want to put it in cage match. There's really no other rules. It doesn't have to

1480
01:45:20,760 --> 01:45:25,920
be a Bamani song. It doesn't have to be a 2005 song. It just has to be something cool

1481
01:45:25,920 --> 01:45:29,440
that we want to play on the air for you guys. So we're going to start off with last week's

1482
01:45:29,440 --> 01:45:34,120
winner of which you're only going to hear a clip of because it was last week's winner.

1483
01:45:34,120 --> 01:45:36,000
And it's going to be song number one you're going to hear tonight.

1484
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:39,280
It's a remix of V from the Diverse Systems Collections.

1485
01:45:39,280 --> 01:45:40,280
Which Diverse Systems was this?

1486
01:45:40,280 --> 01:45:41,280
Eight?

1487
01:45:41,280 --> 01:45:42,280
Nine.

1488
01:45:42,280 --> 01:45:43,280
Nine.

1489
01:45:43,280 --> 01:45:47,000
This is last week's winner, Dorisia with V. Enjoy.

1490
01:45:47,000 --> 01:46:01,720
Gameplay

1491
01:47:47,000 --> 01:48:14,720
Song number one in tonight's cage match, V, a little remix there.

1492
01:48:14,720 --> 01:48:20,720
Alright, we're gonna get into the rest of the cage match tonight, and we're gonna go into song number two, which is Jamie's pick.

1493
01:48:20,720 --> 01:48:24,720
Jamie, I had a hard time figuring out what your pick was. Would you care to explain it here?

1494
01:48:24,720 --> 01:48:29,720
Um, I couldn't think of anything, cause I was busy doing my last bit of illustrator homework.

1495
01:48:29,720 --> 01:48:37,720
So this is from, uh, Team America World Police, the montage song. Cause I couldn't think of anything else.

1496
01:48:37,720 --> 01:48:43,720
Alright, so this is the montage song from Team America World Police, also featured in South Park.

1497
01:48:43,720 --> 01:48:47,720
This is a very random pick, I must say, but let's check it out.

1498
01:48:47,720 --> 01:48:49,720
I couldn't think of anything.

1499
01:48:49,720 --> 01:48:52,720
Alright, here it is. We're going to go into song number two tonight.

1500
01:48:52,720 --> 01:48:56,720
It is The Montage from Team America World Police.

1501
01:48:56,720 --> 01:49:12,720
The hour's approaching to give it your best, and you've got to reach your prime.

1502
01:49:12,720 --> 01:49:17,720
That's when you need to put yourself to the test, and show us the passage of time.

1503
01:49:17,720 --> 01:49:20,720
We're gonna need a mom time.

1504
01:49:20,720 --> 01:49:21,720
Mom time.

1505
01:49:21,720 --> 01:49:23,720
Oh, I need a mom time.

1506
01:49:23,720 --> 01:49:24,720
Mom time.

1507
01:49:24,720 --> 01:49:30,720
To show a lot of things happening at once Remind everyone of what's going on

1508
01:49:30,720 --> 01:49:36,720
And with every shot show a little improvement To show it won't take too long

1509
01:49:36,720 --> 01:49:43,720
That's called a montage Girl, we want a montage

1510
01:49:43,720 --> 01:49:49,720
And anything if you want to go From such a beginner to a pro

1511
01:49:49,720 --> 01:49:52,720
Frozen with a monster

1512
01:49:52,720 --> 01:49:55,720
Even Rocky had a monster

1513
01:49:55,720 --> 01:49:56,720
Monster

1514
01:50:07,720 --> 01:50:09,720
Monster

1515
01:50:09,720 --> 01:50:27,720
Anything if you want to go from just a beginner to a pro

1516
01:50:27,720 --> 01:50:33,720
You need a montage, ooh it takes a montage

1517
01:50:33,720 --> 01:50:39,720
Always fade out in a montage

1518
01:50:39,720 --> 01:50:46,720
If you fade out it seems like more time has passed in a montage

1519
01:50:46,720 --> 01:51:00,720
I'm so bro and green

1520
01:51:00,720 --> 01:51:09,720
Now song number two in tonight's cage match, Montage from Team America World Police. Definitely a random pick, but let's see, DarkSakura, what did you think of that on a scale of one to ten?

1521
01:51:09,720 --> 01:51:11,720
Ten, fuck yeah!

1522
01:51:11,720 --> 01:51:14,720
Extifer on a scale of one to ten.

1523
01:51:14,720 --> 01:51:26,720
I would give it a 9, because it's pretty funny. I've never seen Team America, because I don't know.

1524
01:51:26,720 --> 01:51:28,720
It's not as funny as South Park.

1525
01:51:28,720 --> 01:51:37,720
Okay. Well, I never got into South Park until this year, so I mean, if it's that kind of humor, I may like it. But that song was great.

1526
01:51:37,720 --> 01:51:40,720
Alright. Loki, your thoughts?

1527
01:51:40,720 --> 01:51:45,720
I started off as a 5, but it became a 9 because it gradually got better over time.

1528
01:51:46,720 --> 01:51:47,720
That's good.

1529
01:51:47,720 --> 01:51:48,720
Like a montage.

1530
01:51:48,720 --> 01:51:49,720
Like a montage, yeah, I get it.

1531
01:51:50,720 --> 01:51:55,720
My thoughts is that, damn, between your song and my song, we're practically handing Loki another victory tonight.

1532
01:51:57,720 --> 01:51:59,720
Are we going to need a montage for this?

1533
01:51:59,720 --> 01:52:01,720
Wait until you fucking see what I picked, alright?

1534
01:52:01,720 --> 01:52:02,720
But anyway, I thought-

1535
01:52:02,720 --> 01:52:03,720
Do I need to go hide?

1536
01:52:03,720 --> 01:52:05,720
I thought I was bad tonight, but this was pretty bad.

1537
01:52:05,720 --> 01:52:06,720
Did you all get a montage?

1538
01:52:06,720 --> 01:52:08,720
Yeah, funny enough, I picked a montage. No, I didn't.

1539
01:52:08,720 --> 01:52:14,400
I did. That was... whatever. It's funny, but I just don't think people are going to vote

1540
01:52:14,400 --> 01:52:18,840
for it. I really don't. But it gets a 7, because it is a pretty funny parody. But I think the

1541
01:52:18,840 --> 01:52:23,640
funnier song in Team America World Police was the Everyone Has AIDS song. I almost picked,

1542
01:52:23,640 --> 01:52:29,600
actually it was a tossup between the montage, Everyone Has AIDS, and Pearl Harbor Sucks

1543
01:52:29,600 --> 01:52:35,940
and I Miss You. Even... There's a song called Everyone Has AIDS? Yeah, they're parodying

1544
01:52:35,940 --> 01:52:41,420
rent in it. It's really politically incorrect and that's something that probably shouldn't

1545
01:52:41,420 --> 01:52:45,420
be joked about. In the context of the movie it's really funny.

1546
01:52:45,420 --> 01:52:51,460
Falls. Anyway, let's get into my pick. Song number

1547
01:52:51,460 --> 01:52:56,060
three tonight is from a band that I consider a guilty pleasure band. And you know what

1548
01:52:56,060 --> 01:53:02,420
that means. ABBA! No, it's not ABBA. This is definitely one of those guilty pleasure

1549
01:53:02,420 --> 01:53:06,720
things and there really is no excuse for me liking this song at all and I

1550
01:53:06,720 --> 01:53:12,020
apologize in advance but I'll be damned if this isn't just a damn fun song so my

1551
01:53:12,020 --> 01:53:16,740
pick for tonight's cage mask is a brand new song by everyone's favorite lesbians

1552
01:53:16,740 --> 01:53:23,740
on the Planet Tattoo. This is their new single, All About Us.

1553
01:54:16,740 --> 01:54:42,740
If they hurt you, they hurt me too So we'll rise up, won't stop

1554
01:55:12,740 --> 01:55:40,740
It's all about us It's all about, all about us

1555
01:56:40,740 --> 01:56:47,740
Um, actually I can't, I couldn't hear because I can hear myself too loudly.

1556
01:56:47,740 --> 01:56:52,740
Um, it was repetitive, and it sounded like everything else I've ever heard them do.

1557
01:56:52,740 --> 01:56:54,740
So it gets a five.

1558
01:56:54,740 --> 01:56:57,740
Extifer.

1559
01:56:57,740 --> 01:57:01,740
It's, um, not, it's a very good song.

1560
01:57:01,740 --> 01:57:05,740
It is very stupid. I don't like them. I don't like Tattoo.

1561
01:57:05,740 --> 01:57:09,740
I want to get a tattoo, but I don't like Tattoo.

1562
01:57:09,740 --> 01:57:13,740
And, uh, but the guy getting shot is pretty cool.

1563
01:57:13,740 --> 01:57:17,740
But he should have raped her, I'm sorry. He should have raped her because...

1564
01:57:17,740 --> 01:57:19,740
They all have one to ten before the angry emos come in.

1565
01:57:19,740 --> 01:57:23,740
Oh, okay. Well, um, two. Loki.

1566
01:57:23,740 --> 01:57:27,740
You know, it would have gotten a higher score with me, but I just didn't really know what the song was about.

1567
01:57:27,740 --> 01:57:29,740
So, um, it's getting...

1568
01:57:29,740 --> 01:57:31,740
It's all about them.

1569
01:57:31,740 --> 01:57:34,740
I thought it would... Oh, okay. Well, um...

1570
01:57:34,740 --> 01:57:36,740
It gets to seven.

1571
01:57:36,740 --> 01:57:39,580
Wow, Loki actually gave a higher score than everybody else. I'm kind of surprised.

1572
01:57:39,580 --> 01:57:43,220
Uh, I give that song a 10. Dude, Tattoo is awesome. It's awesome.

1573
01:57:43,220 --> 01:57:47,580
They're so awesome. And the guy gets shot in the video and blood goes everywhere. It's badass.

1574
01:57:47,580 --> 01:57:48,700
Alright.

1575
01:57:48,700 --> 01:57:50,300
She should have been raped.

1576
01:57:50,300 --> 01:57:51,140
Alright.

1577
01:57:51,140 --> 01:57:53,060
That's just what Russians do.

1578
01:57:53,060 --> 01:57:56,700
Alright, song number one. Let's recap the three songs you can vote for tonight.

1579
01:57:56,700 --> 01:57:57,780
Song number one,

1580
01:57:57,780 --> 01:58:04,780

1582
01:58:13,820 --> 01:58:18,540
Beginner to approach, you need a montage

And song number three you can vote for tonight is Tattoo with All About Us

1584
01:58:22,420 --> 01:58:33,660
If they hurt you, they hurt me too

1585
01:58:33,660 --> 01:58:36,700
Alright, I had to choose the best lyric from the song there

1586
01:58:36,700 --> 01:58:39,780
At least they weren't singing All About Us in it

1587
01:58:39,780 --> 01:58:45,300
yeah anyway so there it is place vote now kids send a private message to Sky

1591
01:58:58,780 --> 01:59:06,640
scene nothing not a damn thing huh nothing important sorry oh actually I

1592
01:59:06,640 --> 01:59:15,640
I guess one small thing. Someone put up screenshots, or not screenshots, but conceptual artwork for what will be StepMania 4.

1593
01:59:15,640 --> 01:59:16,640
Oh, it'll be StepMania 4?

1594
01:59:16,640 --> 01:59:31,640
Yeah, someday. And it looks cool. It's, yeah, it looks cool. I don't really know how to describe it, it's just gonna be the same damn thing with another skin on it, but it'll be cool.

1595
01:59:31,640 --> 01:59:38,640
So much for what's going on in The Simpsons.

1596
01:59:38,640 --> 01:59:41,640
I did see that there was a new music game coming out on the PSP.

1597
01:59:41,640 --> 01:59:45,640
As much of a music game as Rez was.

1598
01:59:45,640 --> 01:59:48,640
Didn't we talk about that on a podcast like four weeks ago or something?

1599
01:59:48,640 --> 01:59:50,640
I heard about it. I haven't seen much more about it.

1600
01:59:50,640 --> 01:59:51,640
E3?

1601
01:59:51,640 --> 01:59:53,640
No, not E3, but a Tokyo game show.

1602
01:59:53,640 --> 01:59:54,640
No.

1603
01:59:54,640 --> 01:59:55,640
The game's called E3.

1604
01:59:55,640 --> 01:59:58,640
Oh, that's right. That's right. The game's called E3. I remember now.

1605
01:59:58,640 --> 02:00:02,640
Have screenshots come out of this yet or something?

1606
02:00:02,640 --> 02:00:08,640
No, I watched the Tokyo Game Special on G4, and that was one of their focuses, they were showing that game.

1607
02:00:08,640 --> 02:00:17,640
Looks interesting, it's like a shooter game, but you can combo stuff to make music and stuff.

1608
02:00:17,640 --> 02:00:22,640
It looks very similar to Rez.

1609
02:00:22,640 --> 02:00:26,640
I thought G4 was Spike TV for kids now.

1610
02:00:26,640 --> 02:00:41,640
They have their moments, but this, they actually had the two people from X-Play, Adam and Morgan, and then they had that Kevin guy from Attack on the Show.

1611
02:00:41,640 --> 02:00:50,640
The smartest people on the network to cover Tokugame's show. Thank God they said whoever else that they have there that's really retarded.

1612
02:00:50,640 --> 02:01:01,640
But they got the smart people and they covered it pretty well and they kind of went more in depth with like, you know, the Nintendo Revolution stuff and just everything. But it looked cool.

1613
02:01:01,640 --> 02:01:07,640
Sounds cool. Alright, if I could just show Jamie something real quick. I wanted to make sure Jamie got a chance to see this.

1614
02:01:07,640 --> 02:01:08,640
Is this a gun?

1615
02:01:08,640 --> 02:01:12,640
Yes, this is something we were talking about just a second ago. If you don't mind, listeners.

1616
02:01:12,640 --> 02:01:14,640
I need a gun to keep myself from harm.

1617
02:01:14,640 --> 02:01:17,900
this as a radio show, but those of you that have seen this music video will know exactly

1618
02:01:17,900 --> 02:01:31,460
what I'm talking about right here. And here we go, and bam! Cool! Blood! It looks kind

1619
02:01:31,460 --> 02:01:42,420
of like jelly. It's making me hungry, I need to get something to eat. Does that change

1620
02:01:42,420 --> 02:01:45,140
your score any? I'm just curious if that would alter your score.

1621
02:01:45,140 --> 02:01:48,060
Four. Alright. Wait a minute, didn't you give it a higher

1622
02:01:48,060 --> 02:01:51,140
score before that? Yeah, but now that I've had time to think

1623
02:01:51,140 --> 02:01:56,140
about the song, it needs a montage. Bitch. Alright.

1624
02:01:56,140 --> 02:01:57,140
So. Loki?

1625
02:01:57,140 --> 02:01:58,140
I'll take this. Alright.

1626
02:01:58,140 --> 02:02:05,860
But we have to save it, don't we? We have to save that.

1627
02:02:05,860 --> 02:02:09,860
That's a... that's a... fine.

1628
02:02:09,860 --> 02:02:15,860
Give him a hint. Give him a little hint. You can drop a little hint.

1629
02:02:15,860 --> 02:02:19,860
We made a new web page.

1630
02:02:19,860 --> 02:02:23,860
Okay. Okay. That's good. That's a good hint.

1631
02:02:23,860 --> 02:02:24,860
It's new!

1632
02:02:24,860 --> 02:02:27,860
It's new. Exactly.

1633
02:02:27,860 --> 02:02:29,860
And it's a web page.

1634
02:02:29,860 --> 02:02:34,900
Do kids know that Konami Style had their website launched this week for Guitar Freaks V?

1635
02:02:34,900 --> 02:02:37,460
It also features the arcade controller.

1636
02:02:37,460 --> 02:02:39,660
No, we didn't hit this last week's show, did we?

1637
02:02:39,660 --> 02:02:40,660
Oh, we did.

1638
02:02:40,660 --> 02:02:41,660
Son of a bitch.

1639
02:02:41,660 --> 02:02:42,660
Never mind.

1640
02:02:42,660 --> 02:02:45,260
I just realized we hit that on last week's show.

1641
02:02:45,260 --> 02:02:46,260
Hit.

1642
02:02:46,260 --> 02:02:47,260
Oh.

1643
02:02:47,260 --> 02:02:48,260
How about...

1644
02:02:48,260 --> 02:02:49,260
You know what I haven't done yet?

1645
02:02:49,260 --> 02:02:50,260
What?

1646
02:02:50,260 --> 02:02:51,260
What I need to do?

1647
02:02:51,260 --> 02:02:56,780
I didn't have time during the week, but I need to pop in the DDR Extreme 2 DVD to find

1648
02:02:56,780 --> 02:02:58,380
the track list.

1649
02:02:58,380 --> 02:03:02,380
I think some folks already did that over in New York, right?

1650
02:03:02,380 --> 02:03:06,380
I think they found it already.

1651
02:03:06,380 --> 02:03:10,380
There's nothing really in there, from what I remember.

1652
02:03:10,380 --> 02:03:14,380
What was the other thing I did want to point out? Did we talk about downgrader PSP

1653
02:03:14,380 --> 02:03:18,380
firmware at all? No, not yet. I seemed like we talked about

1654
02:03:18,380 --> 02:03:22,380
that on the podcast, didn't we? No, it didn't happen until... Oh, the actual

1655
02:03:22,380 --> 02:03:26,380
downgrade. We talked about on the podcast the fact

1656
02:03:26,380 --> 02:03:30,820
that 2.0 had been exploited, but we hadn't talked about the downgrader yet. So what does

1657
02:03:30,820 --> 02:03:37,460
this mean for hackers on the PSP? It means if you bought one that happened to be firmware

1658
02:03:37,460 --> 02:03:46,020
1.51 or 1.52 or 2.0, you can actually downgrade it back to 1.5. And the way you do that is

1659
02:03:46,020 --> 02:03:54,320
you run this bit of homebrew code using an exploit in their image, their photo gallery

1660
02:03:54,320 --> 02:03:59,960
everything. It basically is a buffer overflow which allows you to run your own code. And

1661
02:03:59,960 --> 02:04:05,280
what that does is the program makes your PSP think it's a version 1.0. So then what you

1662
02:04:05,280 --> 02:04:11,200
do is then you throw in the version 1.5 update that came out a while ago for the Japanese

1663
02:04:11,200 --> 02:04:15,340
and you run the update. And what will happen is it will crash out at the very end because

1664
02:04:15,340 --> 02:04:20,160
it realizes, hey, wait a second, this isn't, you know, version 1 PSP but then you just

1665
02:04:20,160 --> 02:04:27,520
kind of reset it a few times and you're back at version 1.5. Problem is, is because it's

1666
02:04:27,520 --> 02:04:34,640
only a 99% install, we don't know what kind of repercussions that will have later on.

1667
02:04:34,640 --> 02:04:39,400
I've heard things from like people couldn't get their web browser working again to other

1668
02:04:39,400 --> 02:04:44,560
stuff. But then again, I don't know if that's just, you know, people spreading rumors or

1669
02:04:44,560 --> 02:04:49,260
what. But you can actually, people have downgraded, upgraded, downgraded, upgraded, so you can

1670
02:04:49,260 --> 02:04:53,060
can do it, so you have the best of both worlds. I, on the other hand, I thought about selling

1671
02:04:53,060 --> 02:04:58,300
my other PSP to downgrade it, or downgrade one and sell it, just to get some more money.

1672
02:04:58,300 --> 02:05:02,980
I'm actually going to keep both because I don't know how, you know, obviously they're

1673
02:05:02,980 --> 02:05:07,660
working on version 2.5, which is going to come out soon, so got to keep one for that

1674
02:05:07,660 --> 02:05:14,140
stuff, and then one for the homebrew stuff. Keeping one at 1.5, so.

1675
02:05:14,140 --> 02:05:17,540
Okay, we're going to go to a break now, and in this break we're going to do something

1676
02:05:17,540 --> 02:05:20,800
different we've been playing DDR extreme 2 music all night however we

1677
02:05:20,800 --> 02:05:24,600
haven't played any music from this game and a friend of mine was so kind to

1678
02:05:24,600 --> 02:05:27,920
send me some rips from the game here we're gonna play some songs from DDR

1679
02:05:27,920 --> 02:05:30,880
with Mario because I think a lot of you guys haven't heard what some of these

1680
02:05:30,880 --> 02:05:33,800
songs sound like so we're gonna play some of the songs here we're gonna play

1681
02:05:33,800 --> 02:05:39,040
here we go and I apologize I'm gonna horribly mispronounce this one it's a

1682
02:05:39,040 --> 02:05:45,720
Mozart remix it's um Dokkan no Naka no Mozart and Hoppin Choppin we're gonna

1683
02:05:45,720 --> 02:05:51,160
to play, and Mario no Carnival. They really need to put, like, the Para Para Dancers with

1684
02:05:51,160 --> 02:05:55,000
that commercial that they had for Mario in the, like, U.S. commercials. I think that'd

1685
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:58,240
be great. We'll see. We'll see. All right, we're going to come back after this break

1686
02:05:58,240 --> 02:06:02,040
of music from DDR with Mario so you guys can check this out, and we'll be back with more

1687
02:06:02,040 --> 02:06:03,040
Orange Launch Radio.

1688
02:06:03,040 --> 02:06:10,040
Come on!

1689
02:06:10,040 --> 02:06:17,040
Come on!

1690
02:06:17,040 --> 02:06:24,040
Come on!

1691
02:06:24,040 --> 02:06:31,040
Come on!

1692
02:06:31,040 --> 02:06:31,540
Hey!

1693
02:06:31,540 --> 02:06:32,040
Hey!

1694
02:06:32,040 --> 02:06:32,540
Hey!

1695
02:06:36,540 --> 02:06:37,040
Come on!

1696
02:06:37,040 --> 02:06:37,540
Go.

1697
02:06:37,540 --> 02:06:39,540
Oh

1698
02:07:07,540 --> 02:07:09,540
Oh

1699
02:10:37,540 --> 02:10:39,540
Oh

1700
02:10:39,540 --> 02:10:41,540
Oh

1701
02:12:09,540 --> 02:12:37,140
Hi ho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio

1702
02:12:37,140 --> 02:12:41,140
is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.

1703
02:12:41,140 --> 02:12:46,140
Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

1704
02:12:46,140 --> 02:12:47,140
Sup, kids?

1705
02:12:47,140 --> 02:12:49,140
We're back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1706
02:12:49,140 --> 02:12:51,140
That was some music from DDR with Mario.

1707
02:12:51,140 --> 02:12:52,140
Here we go.

1708
02:12:52,140 --> 02:12:56,140
The Mozart one, Hoppin' Choppin', Carnival, et cetera.

1709
02:12:56,140 --> 02:12:57,140
What did you think of DDR with Mario?

1710
02:12:57,140 --> 02:12:59,140
That's the first time some of you guys are hearing that music.

1711
02:12:59,140 --> 02:13:03,140
It's incredibly happy and makes me so happy I could puke.

1712
02:13:03,140 --> 02:13:05,140
Yeah, that made me so happy that I think I pooped my pants

1713
02:13:05,140 --> 02:13:06,140
because it lost control of my bowels.

1714
02:13:06,140 --> 02:13:09,140
I don't need medication anymore.

1715
02:13:09,140 --> 02:13:10,140
Thank you.

1716
02:13:10,140 --> 02:13:12,140
Use effectser? No!

1717
02:13:12,140 --> 02:13:15,140
Just listen to Mario DDR.

1718
02:13:15,140 --> 02:13:18,140
I heard ice clamor sound effects in there.

1719
02:13:18,140 --> 02:13:19,140
Yes you did.

1720
02:13:19,140 --> 02:13:21,140
The typical Nintendo traits.

1721
02:13:21,140 --> 02:13:22,140
And um...

1722
02:13:22,140 --> 02:13:25,140
Yeah, I know why we don't play that anymore.

1723
02:13:25,140 --> 02:13:27,140
No, it was cute. I thought some of it was cute.

1724
02:13:27,140 --> 02:13:29,140
Like, Hoppin' Choppin' was a cute song, I thought.

1725
02:13:29,140 --> 02:13:30,140
You know what that game needs?

1726
02:13:30,140 --> 02:13:31,140
What?

1727
02:13:31,140 --> 02:13:33,140
A lot of seizure inducing strobing.

1728
02:13:33,140 --> 02:13:34,140
It should have.

1729
02:13:34,140 --> 02:13:39,640
You know what's funny is that you'd think I would have heard that music at E3 when I actually had to play DDR with Mario, but I really didn't.

1730
02:13:39,640 --> 02:13:44,840
But the funny thing is, to put in perspective how difficult DDR with Mario is, I triple-A'd the song I played.

1731
02:13:44,840 --> 02:13:47,640
It's the first time I ever played it.

1732
02:13:47,640 --> 02:13:52,840
And I'm not this... I don't profess to be some type of DDR king, okay? Like, I'm not that great.

1733
02:13:52,840 --> 02:13:53,640
Yes, you do.

1734
02:13:53,640 --> 02:13:55,140
I do not.

1735
02:13:55,140 --> 02:14:02,840
My cousin, Dr. D, does, but I do not profess to be some type of DDR god.

1736
02:14:02,840 --> 02:14:06,340
Anyway, uh, do you kids want to hear who won tonight's cage match? I bet you do.

1737
02:14:06,340 --> 02:14:07,840
Why not?

1738
02:14:07,840 --> 02:14:11,840
Let's hear the results in a montage.

1739
02:14:11,840 --> 02:14:18,840
Actually, you could probably spell out the results in a V formation.

1740
02:14:18,840 --> 02:14:20,840
That song gives me such a headache.

1741
02:14:20,840 --> 02:14:22,340
That's tonight's winner.

1742
02:14:22,340 --> 02:14:27,840
The other two songs not performing quite as badly as I anticipated, actually, so it was actually kind of close.

1743
02:14:27,840 --> 02:14:29,840
So, I was kind of surprised.

1744
02:14:29,840 --> 02:14:31,840
Extover, you got a mic? What?

1745
02:14:31,840 --> 02:14:38,120
Oh, I was just thinking, um, is everybody in the chat room straight because V is like

1746
02:14:38,120 --> 02:14:41,720
for vagina? Like, does everybody just like this one that much?

1747
02:14:41,720 --> 02:14:48,020
You know, I think just like the real world, there's probably some straight people and

1748
02:14:48,020 --> 02:14:52,440
some gay people and some, I don't know what the hell they are, people in our chat room.

1749
02:14:52,440 --> 02:14:56,040
I don't really take the time to ask, you know, I don't go around to everybody.

1750
02:14:56,040 --> 02:14:59,040
Let's take a poll. I don't want to take a poll.

1751
02:14:59,040 --> 02:15:02,040
You don't want to take a poll, you're gay.

1752
02:15:02,040 --> 02:15:03,040
I don't care.

1753
02:15:03,040 --> 02:15:05,040
You like taking polls?

1754
02:15:05,040 --> 02:15:10,040
Yeah, I don't want this to turn into ASL chat, okay?

1755
02:15:10,040 --> 02:15:13,040
Or ASLS, you know, sexuality or whatever. I don't know.

1756
02:15:13,040 --> 02:15:16,040
I don't care. I'm here to talk about games. I don't care who's gay.

1757
02:15:16,040 --> 02:15:23,040
No, no, no. We will know how many of our listeners are gay next week when I put ABBA in.

1758
02:15:23,040 --> 02:15:27,040
Yeah, also, any of you that voted for Tattoo are obviously gay. No, I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

1759
02:15:27,040 --> 02:15:28,040
I'm so kidding.

1760
02:15:28,040 --> 02:15:29,040
That's not true.

1761
02:15:29,040 --> 02:15:30,040
It's not a true...

1762
02:15:30,040 --> 02:15:32,360
I know it's not true, because I know who voted for Tattoo.

1763
02:15:32,360 --> 02:15:33,360
I'm just teasing.

1764
02:15:33,360 --> 02:15:38,880
Just, you know, let me know if you're a pole-loving motherfucker, just tell me.

1765
02:15:38,880 --> 02:15:39,880
You made Roz cry.

1766
02:15:39,880 --> 02:15:41,920
She just wanted me to say that.

1767
02:15:41,920 --> 02:15:42,920
Why?

1768
02:15:42,920 --> 02:15:43,920
Because you made her cry.

1769
02:15:43,920 --> 02:15:44,920
Why did she cry?

1770
02:15:44,920 --> 02:15:46,400
The chatroom made her cry.

1771
02:15:46,400 --> 02:15:47,400
Who's Roz, and why did she cry?

1772
02:15:47,400 --> 02:15:49,920
She's one of my friends from the Gorillaz board.

1773
02:15:49,920 --> 02:15:51,080
Hello, friends.

1774
02:15:51,080 --> 02:15:52,640
And the chatroom just made her cry.

1775
02:15:52,640 --> 02:15:53,640
Why?

1776
02:15:53,640 --> 02:15:54,640
For voting for that one?

1777
02:15:54,640 --> 02:15:55,640
Yeah.

1778
02:15:55,640 --> 02:15:56,640
Sorry.

1779
02:15:56,640 --> 02:15:57,640
It happens.

1780
02:15:57,640 --> 02:16:02,960
tell you. You know. The tribe has spoken. I think she should come in the chat room and

1781
02:16:02,960 --> 02:16:07,960
bitch everybody out for me. Go for it. You, well, this is completely on a tangent but

1782
02:16:07,960 --> 02:16:12,800
since, you know, we're not going anywhere right now. You said friends and that made

1783
02:16:12,800 --> 02:16:17,000
me think of the friends game. I got to watch a video of the friends game and let me just

1784
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:22,360
say I wouldn't wish the friends game on my worst enemies. I watched a good eight minute

1785
02:16:22,360 --> 02:16:26,680
video just saying that I wanted to fall asleep. I didn't even want to play the game after

1786
02:16:26,680 --> 02:16:31,980
watching the game. It's just that awful. Is this another game that we need to get a copy

1787
02:16:31,980 --> 02:16:38,560
of and autograph? It is bad. It is really bad. It's Friends, the one with all the trivia.

1788
02:16:38,560 --> 02:16:48,300
It is narrated by the woman that does Janice on the show, the Fran Drescher wannabe. Hi!

1789
02:16:48,300 --> 02:16:53,220
And it's completely bland and it just shows a bunch of clips from the show and the trivia

1790
02:16:53,220 --> 02:16:57,780
is just lame and I just want the false statement I just like I'm like I can't

1791
02:16:57,780 --> 02:17:06,600
watch this anymore yeah there's a there's a friends game I don't know if

1792
02:17:06,600 --> 02:17:10,400
you got the memo does it have it wait this is the TV show friends right yes

1793
02:17:10,400 --> 02:17:25,820

1794
02:17:25,820 --> 02:17:29,940

1795
02:17:29,940 --> 02:17:35,100

1796
02:17:35,100 --> 02:17:41,860

1799
02:17:51,140 --> 02:17:54,620
actually went through and cleaned my desktop a couple weeks ago you remember

1800
02:17:54,620 --> 02:17:57,940
how messy my desktop used to be like it was just icons everywhere right and you

1808
02:18:37,380 --> 02:18:44,720
What the hell? Why did you do that? Um, I'm not gonna, I, you know, if you're gonna download

1809
02:18:44,720 --> 02:18:48,960
that shit, I mean, don't blame it on me. Okay, this is from the person that left us with

1810
02:18:48,960 --> 02:18:52,400
the bleached asshole joke

1811
02:18:52,400 --> 02:18:53,840
by the way um...

1812
02:18:53,840 --> 02:18:58,080
did they use something other than bleach? did I talk about the asshole strips yet?

1813
02:18:58,080 --> 02:18:59,060
no

1814
02:18:59,060 --> 02:19:02,160
oh well you know how you have like

1815
02:19:02,160 --> 02:19:05,960
yes it's like crest white strips only put on your asshole you leave it for

1816
02:19:05,960 --> 02:19:09,440
you leave them for like a few minutes and then you just strip them off and hey

1817
02:19:09,440 --> 02:19:12,060
what about the kind that are supposed to dissolve

1818
02:19:12,060 --> 02:19:13,800
when you go

1819
02:19:13,800 --> 02:19:15,680
i'm disgusted

1820
02:19:15,680 --> 02:19:21,680
I am so disgusted.

1821
02:19:21,680 --> 02:19:26,240
Remember, mint scattles.

1822
02:19:26,240 --> 02:19:29,880
Okay, we're gonna just get into this here.

1823
02:19:29,880 --> 02:19:34,160
We're gonna get into a new segment here on the show. Well, it's a returning

1824
02:19:34,160 --> 02:19:34,840
segment, really.

1825
02:19:34,840 --> 02:19:38,720
We're trying to make this a regular segment. It's Extraverse Movie Review,

1826
02:19:38,720 --> 02:19:43,440
boys and girls.

1827
02:19:43,440 --> 02:19:45,240
Oh my god, that's gay.

1828
02:19:45,240 --> 02:19:46,800
Exactly, just like you.

1829
02:19:46,800 --> 02:19:48,560
So, Extraverb,

1830
02:19:48,560 --> 02:19:51,060
what movie are you going to review today?

1831
02:19:51,060 --> 02:19:55,200
The Long Kiss Goodnight. The Long Kiss Goodnight. Now, this is an old ass movie.

1832
02:19:55,200 --> 02:19:56,320
Serenity.

1833
02:19:56,320 --> 02:19:59,680
And Serenity, because, well, I've already talked about Serenity, but

1834
02:19:59,680 --> 02:20:02,880
of course everybody probably knows that I'm a Serenity fan.

1835
02:20:02,880 --> 02:20:06,280
I'm a Firefly fan. What did you think of Serenity on the

1836
02:20:06,280 --> 02:20:10,240
second viewing this week? The second viewing was great. I got to see

1837
02:20:10,240 --> 02:20:13,140
it with a lot of people and they all liked it. I was sitting in

1838
02:20:13,140 --> 02:20:17,560
the straight guy row so I was an honorary straight guy. I counted all the girls' boobies

1839
02:20:17,560 --> 02:20:23,140
and it seems like they all have two. I also... Wait, wait, wait. Does that mean that I was

1840
02:20:23,140 --> 02:20:30,660
an honorary gay man that night? Yes. Um, Jamie was sitting in the gay man row, which you

1841
02:20:30,660 --> 02:20:36,580
were sitting in. Yeah, thank you for reminding our listeners. No problem. And, um, I also,

1842
02:20:36,580 --> 02:20:39,580
Um, oh that's so much fun.

1843
02:20:39,580 --> 02:20:44,580
Um, anyways, I just, uh, I wanted to, uh, talk about Serenity more.

1844
02:20:44,580 --> 02:20:49,580
Anyways, so Serenity is great, and then the third time I watched it, which was yesterday,

1845
02:20:49,580 --> 02:20:52,580
I was enjoying it a lot too.

1846
02:20:52,580 --> 02:20:57,580
And my sister, like, hit me in my arm when something really, uh, shocking happened in the movie,

1847
02:20:57,580 --> 02:21:00,580
because she really likes Firefly as well.

1848
02:21:00,580 --> 02:21:01,580
Right.

1849
02:21:01,580 --> 02:21:02,580
So, but it hurt.

1850
02:21:02,580 --> 02:21:04,580
So, Serenity on the third viewing. Thumbs up, thumbs down.

1851
02:21:04,580 --> 02:21:06,580
Thumbs fucking up.

1852
02:21:06,580 --> 02:21:08,580
Alright, thumbs fucking up.

1853
02:21:08,580 --> 02:21:10,580
Alright, how about Long Kiss Goodnight?

1854
02:21:10,580 --> 02:21:12,580
Now this movie's like 20 years old, how old is this?

1855
02:21:12,580 --> 02:21:20,580
I loved that movie when I saw it the first time because Gina Davis kicks ass, and it's just a cheesy, like, action movie.

1856
02:21:20,580 --> 02:21:28,580
But, I mean, I saw it for the first time in years with Garrett, who was on the show last week.

1857
02:21:28,580 --> 02:21:30,580
Alright, the Poppin' Music Whore is what we call him on the ground.

1858
02:21:30,580 --> 02:21:32,580
Oh, Poppin' Music Whore.

1859
02:21:32,580 --> 02:21:38,580
Poppin Music Whore and I made fun of it quite a bit.

1860
02:21:38,580 --> 02:21:40,580
I mean there are so many cheesy lines.

1861
02:21:40,580 --> 02:21:46,580
There's like this line where this guy goes, where Gina Davis says something like,

1862
02:21:46,580 --> 02:21:48,580
I'm saving myself to get raped.

1863
02:21:48,580 --> 02:21:51,580
Like it's just so random. I'm like, okay.

1864
02:21:51,580 --> 02:21:53,580
You know, that was, it was fun.

1865
02:21:53,580 --> 02:21:55,580
It was, you know, it's a fun movie or whatever.

1866
02:21:55,580 --> 02:21:57,580
It's a little long, but anyway.

1867
02:21:57,580 --> 02:21:58,580
I give it.

1868
02:21:58,580 --> 02:21:59,580
Thumbs up or thumbs down?

1869
02:21:59,580 --> 02:22:00,580
Thumbs sideways.

1870
02:22:00,580 --> 02:22:01,580
Alright.

1871
02:22:01,580 --> 02:22:05,380
Now, lastly, you told me that you were going to be reviewing a TV show tonight because

1872
02:22:05,380 --> 02:22:07,340
you didn't get to really see a new movie in the theater.

1873
02:22:07,340 --> 02:22:08,780
You were going to review a TV show tonight.

1874
02:22:08,780 --> 02:22:09,780
I did?

1875
02:22:09,780 --> 02:22:10,780
Yeah.

1876
02:22:10,780 --> 02:22:11,780
Which TV show?

1877
02:22:11,780 --> 02:22:14,620
Oh, The Will and Grace.

1878
02:22:14,620 --> 02:22:17,820
I'm glad you prepped for tonight's movie review segment.

1879
02:22:17,820 --> 02:22:19,220
Will and Grace.

1880
02:22:19,220 --> 02:22:24,880
I'd never gotten to Will and Grace until this year when I moved to Sacramento.

1881
02:22:24,880 --> 02:22:31,260
I think it's pretty damn hilarious, but they had their live show which I was hoping for

1882
02:22:31,260 --> 02:22:37,860
them to mess up more, but they didn't. But it was funny anyway. I had a good time with

1883
02:22:37,860 --> 02:22:38,860
it.

1884
02:22:38,860 --> 02:22:39,860
Alright, so thumbs up or thumbs down for Will & Grace?

1885
02:22:39,860 --> 02:22:40,860
Thumbs up.

1886
02:22:40,860 --> 02:22:41,860
Thumbs up.

1887
02:22:41,860 --> 02:22:42,860
Up.

1888
02:22:42,860 --> 02:22:43,860
Up.

1889
02:22:43,860 --> 02:22:44,860
Up.

1890
02:22:44,860 --> 02:22:45,860
Up.

1891
02:22:45,860 --> 02:22:46,860
This is so boring.

1892
02:22:46,860 --> 02:22:49,940
Alright. Thank you, Xtifer, for that movie review. Now get off our show.

1893
02:22:49,940 --> 02:22:50,940
Thank you.

1894
02:22:50,940 --> 02:22:55,460
Get off our show. Alright.

1895
02:22:55,460 --> 02:22:59,780
We're going to get into another segment we love to do here on Orange Lawns Radio every

1896
02:22:59,780 --> 02:23:11,620
single damn week because you know what, you know what, we are full of angst. I am full

1897
02:23:11,620 --> 02:23:16,300
of tirade. That's right, so that's why we have to do the FUs of the week every single

1898
02:23:16,300 --> 02:23:19,480
week. And DarkSakura, what's your excuse? Why do we have to do the FUs of the week every

1899
02:23:19,480 --> 02:23:21,480
every single week.

1900
02:23:21,480 --> 02:23:23,480
Balls.

1901
02:23:30,480 --> 02:23:34,480
A big F.U. goes toward my sinus infection that I'm finally over.

1902
02:23:34,480 --> 02:23:36,480
And the fact that I haven't worked out.

1903
02:23:36,480 --> 02:23:41,480
An F.U. goes toward the Adobe company for making Illustrator?

1904
02:23:41,480 --> 02:23:43,480
I hate vectors.

1905
02:23:43,480 --> 02:23:47,480
You know you've been doing Illustrator homework for too long?

1906
02:23:47,480 --> 02:23:54,480
When you start seeing real life in terms of vectors, I hate vectors. I hate them, hate them, hate them.

1907
02:23:54,480 --> 02:24:02,480
And I am posting my homework in my chatroom. I did that one best, which is in a red monotone. It really is looking like shit.

1908
02:24:02,480 --> 02:24:15,480
I also am mad at people in SUVs. What's that kind of like on the Escalade? It looks like it's a fake SUV with a truck ass?

1909
02:24:15,480 --> 02:24:17,480
I don't like the SUVs that look like a box.

1910
02:24:17,480 --> 02:24:20,480
Someone at Sam's Club last night was double parked in one of them.

1911
02:24:20,480 --> 02:24:23,480
And I totally made fun of them loudly in the parking lot and they hurt me.

1912
02:24:23,480 --> 02:24:24,480
Was it a lesbian?

1913
02:24:24,480 --> 02:24:27,480
No, it was some stupid, yuppie-looking man.

1914
02:24:27,480 --> 02:24:29,480
Oh. So it was a lesbian.

1915
02:24:29,480 --> 02:24:30,480
I was screaming,

1916
02:24:30,480 --> 02:24:33,480
Hi! I have money! And I have shit for brains that can't park!

1917
02:24:33,480 --> 02:24:35,480
And he heard me and then I drove off.

1918
02:24:35,480 --> 02:24:36,480
That's awesome.

1919
02:24:36,480 --> 02:24:39,480
You know, I called a lady a cunt one time because Rob told me to.

1920
02:24:39,480 --> 02:24:41,480
Really?

1921
02:24:41,480 --> 02:24:46,440
He told me to roll down the window and cuz he was some lady cut him off in the parking lot

1922
02:24:46,440 --> 02:24:50,000
And he goes that lady's a cunt Christopher roll down that window a car cunt

1923
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:54,080
It's just jokingly you know and I'm like I looked at him, and I looked at everybody else in the car

1924
02:24:54,080 --> 02:24:57,960
I said well, okay, nine round. I rolled down the window, and I said you're a cunt

1925
02:24:59,760 --> 02:25:06,920
And and Rob can back me up. That's he's not making this shit up. He really isn't um and

1926
02:25:06,920 --> 02:25:12,920
And, uh, Legend of Zaku, you get an F.U. because I've had my work on for a very long fucking time.

1927
02:25:12,920 --> 02:25:18,920
And I still hate the stupid goddamn program because he made us fucking use the pen tool.

1928
02:25:18,920 --> 02:25:25,920
I could have done the whole thing with the drawing tool, but no, we had to do it with the pen tool.

1929
02:25:25,920 --> 02:25:29,920
So, don't fucking ever correct me again. You don't have the right.

1930
02:25:29,920 --> 02:25:37,920
Um, a second Fe goes toward Loki's song because it gives me a headache every time I hear it.

1931
02:25:37,920 --> 02:25:45,920
Um, and an Fe did gold detailing on cars that really don't need gold detailing.

1932
02:25:45,920 --> 02:25:54,920
Um, and, um, also another Fe legend is Aku because I was not a math major because it was a waste of my time.

1933
02:25:54,920 --> 02:26:05,160
Um, and, uh, really, um, okay, if he says anything more about what I need, I'm fucking

1934
02:26:05,160 --> 02:26:06,160
kicking you, okay?

1935
02:26:06,160 --> 02:26:09,560
In fact, I'm gonna do it anyway just because I fucking feel like it.

1936
02:26:09,560 --> 02:26:12,240
You piss me off every time I come here.

1937
02:26:12,240 --> 02:26:15,240
Stop pissing me off!

1938
02:26:15,240 --> 02:26:21,400
Um, and, uh, F.U. goes toward, uh, everything else.

1939
02:26:21,400 --> 02:26:28,400
That was fantastic. That was. Is that it? Yeah. Alright, here we go. Next up, Loki. Okay,

1940
02:26:35,680 --> 02:26:40,320
I've really got like one major one that I need to get off my chest and that is, fuck

1941
02:26:40,320 --> 02:26:46,160
you to the fact that I'm potentially have to go to jury duty on Tuesday. Tell them you're

1942
02:26:46,160 --> 02:26:49,160
Go to school. You'll get out of it until December.

1943
02:27:16,160 --> 02:27:25,240
so, whatever. And, um, yeah, pretty much that, and for some reason, um, I'm having problems

1944
02:27:25,240 --> 02:27:34,200
with certain things, uh, web page related, that piss me off. But, um, yeah, I'm done.

1945
02:27:34,200 --> 02:27:36,200
That's all I really have.

1946
02:27:40,200 --> 02:27:42,200
Okay, my turn then.

1947
02:27:49,200 --> 02:27:56,200
I want to give an F.U. to me for not getting enough sleep at night throughout the weekend, on the weekend.

1948
02:27:57,200 --> 02:28:00,200
I want to give an F.U. to the fact... Shut the fuck up Christopher.

1949
02:28:00,200 --> 02:28:05,320
I want to give an F.U. to the fact that I haven't been eating very well all week, but

1950
02:28:05,320 --> 02:28:08,760
at least I've kind of, despite my irregular eating patterns, I've actually managed to

1951
02:28:08,760 --> 02:28:12,040
lose some weight, so I guess I can't complain too much except, you know, I don't want to

1952
02:28:12,040 --> 02:28:15,940
like kill my liver or anything.

1953
02:28:15,940 --> 02:28:21,760
And so an F.U. to lack of motivation for that, an F.U. to other drama that I'm going through

1954
02:28:21,760 --> 02:28:28,400
professionally right now, but I'll be okay, and just an F.U. to the fact that I still

1955
02:28:28,400 --> 02:28:32,400
I still have work left to do and it's Sunday night and I've got to have it done by tomorrow morning.

1956
02:28:32,400 --> 02:28:33,400
Sucks.

1957
02:28:33,400 --> 02:28:36,400
And then, um, I guess that's it.

1958
02:28:36,400 --> 02:28:40,400
F you to Fandango because it costs like $1.25 to use Fandango.

1959
02:28:40,400 --> 02:28:43,400
Did you do the Fandango with your credit card?

1960
02:28:43,400 --> 02:28:44,400
I did.

1961
02:28:44,400 --> 02:28:45,400
Fandango.

1962
02:28:45,400 --> 02:28:46,400
Fandango.

1963
02:28:46,400 --> 02:28:47,400
HoboCam.

1964
02:28:47,400 --> 02:28:48,400
HoboCam.

1965
02:28:48,400 --> 02:28:51,400
Um, and come to find out that Serenity wasn't even that crowded.

1966
02:28:51,400 --> 02:28:53,400
Like, I could have just walked right in and got tickets.

1967
02:28:53,400 --> 02:28:57,400
I thought, just because of all the hype on LJ, I thought that theater was going to be packed.

1968
02:28:57,400 --> 02:29:06,400
Actually, I'm sure that the earlier ones were, but I still think it's funny that I, uh, woke up late and then made it down the freeway in 15 minutes.

1969
02:29:06,400 --> 02:29:09,400
Alright, that was crazy. Alright.

1970
02:29:09,400 --> 02:29:10,400
Things I do for fandom.

1971
02:29:10,400 --> 02:29:14,400
Alright, let's get to extrovertz FUs.

1972
02:29:14,400 --> 02:29:19,400
Um, FU to people with unnecessary drama.

1973
02:29:19,400 --> 02:29:24,400
You know, um, I'm so indifferent to you, I don't care.

1974
02:29:24,400 --> 02:29:26,400
Don't bring it in, put it in my face.

1975
02:29:26,400 --> 02:29:34,400
You know, um, but otherwise, a big old fuck you in a good way to everybody I like.

1976
02:29:34,400 --> 02:29:55,320
dark knight says f you to gas prices work and studying for tests

1977
02:29:55,320 --> 02:30:03,800

1978
02:30:03,800 --> 02:30:07,680
Tomokun says, fuck not getting my Para Para Para machine.

1979
02:30:07,680 --> 02:30:10,840
Fuck my cold and fuck my bad RAM.

1980
02:30:10,840 --> 02:30:13,560
That sounded dirty.

1981
02:30:13,560 --> 02:30:17,840
Sakurina says, fuck Life 365 for making me miss the first quarter of the show.

1982
02:30:17,840 --> 02:30:20,980
Fuck that guy who's been stealing that 12 year old I find cute.

1983
02:30:20,980 --> 02:30:23,760
Fuck Illustrator because it makes Dark Sakura angry.

1984
02:30:23,760 --> 02:30:28,460
And fuck Tomo-kun in a friendly way for interrupting my bisexual erotica reading session.

1985
02:30:28,460 --> 02:30:32,240
And F you to all USDR mixes for not having little bitch.

1986
02:30:32,240 --> 02:30:36,040
Now I need to get Pump It Up and put it in there.

1987
02:30:36,040 --> 02:30:39,260
MPQ says F you to guys that pretend to be girls on the internet.

1988
02:30:39,260 --> 02:30:41,380
I feel like a fucking internet cliche.

1989
02:30:41,380 --> 02:30:45,860
F you to my router for being a piece of shit and randomly deciding to not let people connect.

1990
02:30:45,860 --> 02:30:51,300
F you to injection of Love Hina mix for reminding me of Love Hina, which I hate.

1991
02:30:51,300 --> 02:30:55,460
Goggle says, F you to Garden Burger for tasting like meatloaf instead of a burger.

1992
02:30:55,460 --> 02:30:56,460
I agree.

1993
02:30:56,460 --> 02:30:58,060
F you to the awful lag I'm getting.

1994
02:30:58,060 --> 02:31:00,780
It is all about the Boca Burger, honey.

1995
02:31:00,780 --> 02:31:04,020
Snare, F you to V for still being there.

1996
02:31:04,020 --> 02:31:09,180
F you to Bevmo, or Beverages and More, but as I call it, the Bevmo, for having such great

1997
02:31:09,180 --> 02:31:11,460
drinks that suck my wallet dry.

1998
02:31:11,460 --> 02:31:14,980
Another F you to Bevmo for having paper bags that have no handles.

1999
02:31:14,980 --> 02:31:18,940
So you could go around looking like a wino.

2000
02:31:18,940 --> 02:31:22,040

my immune system illusion says f you to family guy for sucking so much recently

2005
02:31:36,580 --> 02:31:40,940
so I would agree to older episodes that string along the already thin plot lame

2006
02:31:40,940 --> 02:31:41,660
I agree

2007
02:31:41,660 --> 02:31:45,340
five hundred percent family guy sucks this year

2008
02:31:45,340 --> 02:31:51,220
Rene says, my utmost ultimate fuck you goes to Dance Master Mode's mission with Boom Boom

2009
02:31:51,220 --> 02:31:54,080
Dollar KOG G3 on Break.

2010
02:31:54,080 --> 02:31:57,740
Fuck Break like I'll get out because it's the worst modifier ever.

2011
02:31:57,740 --> 02:32:02,740
This fuck ass mission has literally made Dance Master impossible to complete for me.

2012
02:32:02,740 --> 02:32:05,540
And everybody, I want you to use fuck ass in a sentence later today.

2013
02:32:05,540 --> 02:32:07,340
That's the word of the day.

2014
02:32:07,340 --> 02:32:11,740
And fuck anybody who said the dynamite rave heavy on reverse on hard because it wasn't

2015
02:32:11,740 --> 02:32:13,860
and it still wasn't

2016
02:32:13,860 --> 02:32:16,860
when you had to not do well on it

2017
02:32:16,860 --> 02:32:20,860
and of course one for Sky because of his hidden bad omen from last week

2018
02:32:20,860 --> 02:32:24,740
uh... you guys may or may not remember I put a hex on Rini last week because um...

2019
02:32:24,740 --> 02:32:29,700
I was mad at him about something I don't remember what now

2020
02:32:29,700 --> 02:32:34,420
Brightsta says F you to gas prices F you to people who smoke I'd like to sue you for

2021
02:32:34,420 --> 02:32:35,780
second hand smoking

2022
02:32:35,780 --> 02:32:39,560
F you to this asshole who's in our dorm and keeps playing his music really loud

2023
02:32:39,560 --> 02:32:43,720
F you to the campus store for having such high prices for food, F you to my router which

2024
02:32:43,720 --> 02:32:48,200
XP keeps showing as disconnecting my ethernet cable physically.

2025
02:32:48,200 --> 02:32:54,040
And just an FYI, as someone who used to smoke, your anger is not going to make them stop

2026
02:32:54,040 --> 02:32:55,040
any faster.

2027
02:32:55,040 --> 02:32:59,120
By the way, as far as the people in dorm rooms that play their music really loudly, what

2028
02:32:59,120 --> 02:33:04,080
I used to do is I used to, when the people across the hall would play their rap really

2029
02:33:04,080 --> 02:33:08,960
loudly, because I hate, you know, that type of rap, I would turn on my stereo really loud,

2030
02:33:08,960 --> 02:33:15,080
was on top of my chest of drawers, and we had cinder block walls, and would crank Vanessa

2031
02:33:15,080 --> 02:33:20,000
May to the ultimate loudness on Takata and Fugin D minor, but you should do that with

2032
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:26,340
the organ version, because I guarantee you, it will chase people off, and you'll have

2033
02:33:26,340 --> 02:33:29,480
the entire building to yourself. It works!

2034
02:33:29,480 --> 02:33:38,040
To the person quitting smoking, maybe you should think about having to fuck ass every

2035
02:33:38,040 --> 02:33:42,840
time you want to smoke a sir 800 says a big f you to my trick teacher who is a

02:33:42,840 --> 02:33:47,580
lazy master student who teaches shit during class and f you to the lady who

2037
02:33:47,580 --> 02:33:50,360
is behind me while I was driving and freaking honked at me when there was a

2038
02:33:50,360 --> 02:33:54,920
cop in front of me and I didn't want to be arrested

2039
02:33:54,920 --> 02:34:00,860
legend of Zaku says f you to not having a modded slim ps2 and some bimani games

2040
02:34:00,860 --> 02:34:04,720
and I should have had them by now if you to my ever so weak and shitty DDR stop

2041
02:34:04,720 --> 02:34:09,560
F you to me being a bitch about whether or not to compete in freestyle in a major tourney

2042
02:34:09,560 --> 02:34:13,640
that you probably already know about next Saturday.

2043
02:34:13,640 --> 02:34:17,680
Dark Tetsuya says F you to mission C30 and the mission with Dynamite Ray of Oni.

2044
02:34:17,680 --> 02:34:20,600
God you have a lot of angst tonight chat room.

2045
02:34:20,600 --> 02:34:25,300
F you to the fanboy says Ron Chan at the Yoko Ishida concert.

2046
02:34:25,300 --> 02:34:28,280
No one cares you came from Boston you were loud and rude.

2047
02:34:28,280 --> 02:34:29,800
Go jump in traffic.

2048
02:34:29,800 --> 02:34:35,040
I'm going to use that at some point this week during a call.

2049
02:34:35,040 --> 02:34:38,560
Yeah, tell one of your callers to go jump in traffic.

2050
02:34:38,560 --> 02:34:39,560
Enjoy your life.

2051
02:34:39,560 --> 02:34:40,840
We're not going to pay your claim.

2052
02:34:40,840 --> 02:34:42,220
Go jump in traffic.

2053
02:34:42,220 --> 02:34:46,200
ColorOfSakura says, F you to all the stuff I've bought on eBay in the last month and

2054
02:34:46,200 --> 02:34:47,600
it's still not being here.

2055
02:34:47,600 --> 02:34:50,000
F you to the break modifier in DDR.

2056
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:56,260
And lastly, GS191 says, F you to my college for putting all my core classes, especially

2057
02:34:56,260 --> 02:35:01,240
math online. F you to websites that are taken down without warning and call it redesigning.

2058
02:35:01,240 --> 02:35:05,860
Yes, I'm looking at you, DDRMania X and Bamani Style. F you to myself for not having any

02:35:43,840 --> 02:35:47,840

2069
02:35:52,240 --> 02:35:55,440
We're going to get to the rest of the Xtreme 2 music I wanted to play tonight.

2070
02:35:55,440 --> 02:36:01,440
We're going to play Spin Spin Sugar, Tomorrow, which is a great Konami original.

2071
02:36:01,440 --> 02:36:02,720
I really like this song, Tomorrow.

2072
02:36:02,720 --> 02:36:03,600
Not like Annie.

2073
02:36:03,600 --> 02:36:05,280
Tomorrow, tomorrow.

2074
02:36:05,280 --> 02:36:06,800
That's exactly what I thought of.

2075
02:36:06,800 --> 02:36:08,240
I know, because you're a big Nelly Queen.

2076
02:36:08,880 --> 02:36:11,600
And then the last song we're going to play is Fat Boy Slim with Wonderful Night.

2077
02:36:11,600 --> 02:36:13,600
So we're going to play those songs brand new from DDREX2.

2078
02:36:13,600 --> 02:36:14,800
That's a wonderful name.

2079
02:36:14,800 --> 02:36:15,200
Thank you.

2080
02:36:15,200 --> 02:36:15,680
Is that the one?

2081
02:36:15,680 --> 02:36:16,400
That is the one.

2082
02:36:16,400 --> 02:36:17,200
Good job.

2083
02:36:17,200 --> 02:36:17,440
All right.

2084
02:36:19,040 --> 02:36:20,640
Ask Orange Lounge when we come back.

2085
02:36:20,640 --> 02:36:22,480
And you guys had a lot of questions last week.

2086
02:36:22,480 --> 02:36:23,520
We didn't even get to all of them.

2087
02:36:23,520 --> 02:36:25,520
So we missed your question last week.

2088
02:36:25,520 --> 02:36:28,280
Here's your chance to get it answered after we come back.

2089
02:36:28,280 --> 02:36:31,200
So send a private message to Skye with your question for

2090
02:36:31,200 --> 02:36:33,000
Ask Orange Lounge.

2091
02:36:33,000 --> 02:36:35,000
We'll be back after this.

2092
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:09,160
Crawl on me Spin, spin, sugar

2093
02:37:10,760 --> 02:37:17,080
Spill it for me Spin, spin, sugar

2094
02:37:17,080 --> 02:37:24,080
With all me, it's been sugar

2095
02:37:47,080 --> 02:38:13,080
Oh, come on me, thin, thin sugar, drive on me, thin, thin sugar, stayin' strong.

2096
02:38:17,080 --> 02:38:45,840
I like to think we've got to take it easy, captured in frame,

2097
02:38:45,840 --> 02:38:47,840
Captured in frame

2098
02:38:47,840 --> 02:38:49,840
I've got so much to lose

2099
02:39:17,840 --> 02:39:21,840
Drop it, anymore

2100
02:39:47,840 --> 02:39:48,840

14

2129
02:40:16,840 --> 02:40:20,720
Music search, and you need a tune-up Soon as they out the gate, they all wanna

2130
02:40:20,720 --> 02:40:24,080
hit a corner, uh-huh Well, that was cool, but now, but then I heard

2131
02:40:24,080 --> 02:40:27,200
a rumor, uh-huh Your crew was riding for the White Cliffs of

2132
02:40:27,200 --> 02:40:30,560
Dover, uh-huh Well, let me tell you how we do it in California

2133
02:40:30,560 --> 02:40:35,720
We'll have you on the run just like a Puma If it don't move us, ain't paid your dues

2134
02:40:35,720 --> 02:40:39,640
and it ain't gon' get our groove us So we lose ya to the consumer solution,

2135
02:40:39,640 --> 02:40:42,800
come on It's a wonderful night, gotta take it from

2136
02:40:42,800 --> 02:40:46,480
me It's a wonderful night, break it on down

2137
02:40:46,480 --> 02:40:49,280
It's a wonderful night, you gotta shake it for me

2138
02:40:49,280 --> 02:40:52,280
It's a wonderful night, come on and break it on down

2139
02:40:52,280 --> 02:40:55,080
Girl I want it, you got it, your body's like an autotic

2140
02:40:55,080 --> 02:40:58,280
The thought is autoerotic, come on and break it on down

2141
02:40:58,280 --> 02:41:00,580
Can I get it on credit or get your brick house?

2142
02:41:00,580 --> 02:41:04,480
I bet it, take it as far as you let it, come on and break it on down

2143
02:41:10,280 --> 02:41:13,080
That the spot'll get hot, that it's ready to pop

2144
02:41:13,080 --> 02:41:16,080
Don't even look at the clock, all of your problems forgotten

2145
02:41:16,080 --> 02:41:17,760
It's time to rock till you drop

2146
02:41:17,760 --> 02:41:22,240
Will the force end just like with the epicenter of a party's base tremors? Come on!

2147
02:41:22,240 --> 02:41:25,280
It's a wonderful night, gotta take it from me

2148
02:41:25,280 --> 02:41:28,400
It's a wonderful night, come on and break it on down

2149
02:41:28,400 --> 02:41:31,280
It's a wonderful night, gotta take it from me

2150
02:41:31,280 --> 02:41:34,320
It's a wonderful night, come on and break it on down

2151
02:41:36,320 --> 02:41:39,920
After this song, we'll be having a Let Them Move marathon

2152
02:41:39,920 --> 02:41:40,400
Nooooooo

2153
02:41:40,400 --> 02:41:46,400
Just kidding, Orange Lounge Radio, crap-free Bhimani Radio.

2154
02:41:46,400 --> 02:41:49,400
Welcome back kids, we're about ready to get into Ask Orange Lounge.

2155
02:41:49,400 --> 02:41:54,400
However, first off I wanted to point out that we actually have somebody who,

2156
02:41:54,400 --> 02:42:00,400
there was an F.U. back there that was about Bhimani style and how they're down all the time.

2157
02:42:00,400 --> 02:42:04,400
Actually we have somebody who happens to be one of their moderators over at Bhimani style

2158
02:42:04,400 --> 02:42:08,400
that would like us to clarify, they aren't down for redesigning.

2159
02:42:08,400 --> 02:42:11,760
motherboard on their server went kaboom!

2160
02:42:11,760 --> 02:42:15,440
There's been word, however, that MontyStyle 7.0 is progressing nicely, however.

2161
02:42:15,440 --> 02:42:17,440
Just a friendly clarification.

2162
02:42:17,440 --> 02:42:21,520
I need to also make the announcement, the one that I mentioned to you during the break.

2163
02:42:21,520 --> 02:42:22,520
Sure.

2164
02:42:22,520 --> 02:42:30,240
There will not be a pump up in volume this week because of other reasons, but I will

2165
02:42:30,240 --> 02:42:34,720
be returning the week after with the much promised, because actually people did ask

2166
02:42:34,720 --> 02:42:36,720
for it, Blur Marathon.

2167
02:42:36,720 --> 02:42:37,720
Awesome.

2168
02:42:37,720 --> 02:42:40,200
All right, sounds good.

2169
02:42:40,200 --> 02:42:42,520
And I'm bringing back my weeknight show

2170
02:42:42,520 --> 02:42:43,360
sometime this month.

2171
02:42:43,360 --> 02:42:44,800
Absolutely, positively.

2172
02:42:44,800 --> 02:42:46,000
No more delaying for me.

2173
02:42:46,000 --> 02:42:48,520
So I'll be back sometime this month with something special

2174
02:42:48,520 --> 02:42:51,040
for you kids.

2175
02:42:51,040 --> 02:42:51,640
So we'll see.

2176
02:42:51,640 --> 02:42:52,720
All right, anyway, moving on.

2177
02:42:52,720 --> 02:42:54,200
Let's go to Ask Orange Lounge.

2178
02:42:54,200 --> 02:43:05,440
Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question, what will we find out this week on Orange

2179
02:43:05,440 --> 02:43:07,400
Lounge Radio?

2180
02:43:07,400 --> 02:43:15,640
My question is this, who will be the first person to use the word fuckass in their question?

2181
02:43:15,640 --> 02:43:21,640
What would your ultimate video game be?

2182
02:43:21,640 --> 02:43:27,640
Golf Land Birthday Party Sniper

2183
02:43:27,640 --> 02:43:30,640
would be my ultimate video game.

2184
02:43:30,640 --> 02:43:33,640
Dark Sakura, do you have an ultimate video game?

2185
02:43:33,640 --> 02:43:35,640
The Guardian Legend

2186
02:43:35,640 --> 02:43:37,640
Okay, I'm not sure if the part would be...

2187
02:43:37,640 --> 02:43:41,640
Completely redone for one of the new systems.

2188
02:43:41,640 --> 02:43:42,640
That would be very sexy.

2189
02:43:42,640 --> 02:43:47,640
What would your ultimate video game be?

2190
02:43:47,640 --> 02:43:52,640
In the ass.

2191
02:43:52,640 --> 02:43:57,640
Loki, what would your ultimate video game be?

2192
02:43:57,640 --> 02:44:02,640
I think they should have a fighting game with every character from all the systems.

2193
02:44:02,640 --> 02:44:07,640
Just one giant brawl. Call it Console Wars or something like that.

2194
02:44:07,640 --> 02:44:14,640
Alusion says, What's it all about, Alfie?

2195
02:44:14,640 --> 02:44:21,640
Well, I don't watch crappy Jude Law movies, so I don't know.

2196
02:44:21,640 --> 02:44:25,640
And I didn't watch the crappy original either, I'm sorry to say, so I don't really know what it's all about.

2197
02:44:25,640 --> 02:44:28,640
Apparently they weren't crappy. I mean, they got some critical mass, didn't they?

2198
02:44:28,640 --> 02:44:30,640
Well, the first one I'm sure was critically loved.

2199
02:44:30,640 --> 02:44:34,640
You say Alfie, I start thinking of like in Barbarella, her shit. Alfie?

2200
02:44:34,640 --> 02:44:38,280
Well I think of the little creature from Melmac that liked to eat cats.

2201
02:44:38,280 --> 02:44:39,280
That's Alf!

2202
02:44:39,280 --> 02:44:42,400
Well you could call him Alfie as a nickname.

2203
02:44:42,400 --> 02:44:43,400
No.

2204
02:44:43,400 --> 02:44:44,400
Ha!

2205
02:44:44,400 --> 02:44:45,880
I kill me!

2206
02:44:45,880 --> 02:44:47,880
Damn you people.

2207
02:44:47,880 --> 02:44:50,440
Ha ha ha ha.

2208
02:44:50,440 --> 02:44:54,480
Brightsta says, can you pass me the first of the Mario Mix songs we heard?

2209
02:44:54,480 --> 02:44:57,120
I'd like to add Captain Lou Albano to it.

2210
02:44:57,120 --> 02:45:00,240
Now kids, piracy is wrong.

2211
02:45:00,240 --> 02:45:02,160
Email me off air.

2212
02:45:02,160 --> 02:45:07,920
However, it did sound an awful lot like, you know, the, or actually, let me get into this.

2213
02:45:07,920 --> 02:45:16,920
Do the Mario, swing your arms from side to side, come on, the time to go, do the Mario!

2214
02:45:16,920 --> 02:45:23,520
Total silence.

2215
02:45:23,520 --> 02:45:30,080
Sockarina says, um, will my request for that diverse system remix of Quasar be played before

2216
02:45:30,080 --> 02:45:34,820
the end of the show. Not likely tonight, my friend, but probably next week when we don't

2217
02:45:34,820 --> 02:45:38,240
have so much Xtreme 2 music to worry about.

2218
02:45:38,240 --> 02:45:43,740
Sakarina says, what does each member of the Orange Launch Radio crew prefer? Hairy or

2219
02:45:43,740 --> 02:45:52,700
hairless balls?

2220
02:45:52,700 --> 02:45:56,620
It's a toss-up. Because, you know, there's some days where I'm like, you know, wake up

2221
02:45:56,620 --> 02:46:01,820
in the morning you know and you know want to get my daily you know porn for

2222
02:46:01,820 --> 02:46:07,540
breakfast and it's like maybe I want to see hairy balls sometimes you know wake

2223
02:46:07,540 --> 02:46:13,480
up in the morning and I want to see hairless balls sometimes I have that you

2224
02:46:13,480 --> 02:46:19,020
know a can desire to shave my own balls Loki okay here you go how about balls

2225
02:46:19,020 --> 02:46:22,820
that aren't as hot as the surface of the Sun and fucking sweaty all the time

2226
02:46:22,820 --> 02:46:31,020
time. Those are the balls that we prefer. How about bowling balls? I like cheese balls.

2227
02:46:31,020 --> 02:46:41,980
Cheese balls are good. Jazz says, the answer to your question is I can't say that on air.

2228
02:46:41,980 --> 02:46:50,940
That's what it is. I like meatballs. Yeah, meatballs. For my Q and A. And Jazz, don't

2229
02:46:50,940 --> 02:47:00,940
Zaku says, what will I win if I guess the DDR song used in last Friday's episode of MTV2's Video Mods featuring DDR Extreme 2?

2230
02:47:00,940 --> 02:47:02,940
I don't know.

2231
02:47:02,940 --> 02:47:04,940
Does anybody in this room watch MTV?

2232
02:47:04,940 --> 02:47:06,940
I know, I don't watch it. Are they giving it away?

2233
02:47:06,940 --> 02:47:08,940
Reject false icons!

2234
02:47:08,940 --> 02:47:10,940
Are they giving it away? Because we're not.

2235
02:47:10,940 --> 02:47:16,940
After they did that next marathon for like five days straight, I was like, I can't watch this channel anymore.

2236
02:47:16,940 --> 02:47:23,440
Jaded wants to know, where did you get the Ask Orange Lounge intro music?

2237
02:47:23,440 --> 02:47:28,980
The Ask Orange Lounge intro music is actually Journey to the Wonderland from Keyboard Mania

2238
02:47:28,980 --> 02:47:29,980
2.

2239
02:47:29,980 --> 02:47:34,900
It's Keyboard Mania 2, it's Journey to the Wonderland by NPB.

2240
02:47:34,900 --> 02:47:45,560
And then the lyrics, of course, are sung by yours truly, the one and only Sky.

2241
02:47:45,560 --> 02:47:51,960
says hey Sky you should play get busy just to throw the chatroom off you know

2242
02:47:51,960 --> 02:47:54,760
there's a reason I didn't play get busy tonight and that's because I had to play

2243
02:47:54,760 --> 02:48:00,640
it 20 times this week in mission mode Renee wants to know could you help a

2244
02:48:00,640 --> 02:48:05,400
poor soul with my break problem pretty please I already used step mania and I

2245
02:48:05,400 --> 02:48:13,000
can't do that fuck-ass thinking hehe um you know break I remember was in one of

2246
02:48:13,000 --> 02:48:24,000
The best way to do it was to play that song over and over in regular mode and so you kind

2247
02:48:24,000 --> 02:48:28,260
of like, you start to hear your feet as a separate rhythm in your head.

2248
02:48:28,260 --> 02:48:30,920
It's very similar to the way you get really good at 2DX, you start to hear what the key

2249
02:48:30,920 --> 02:48:33,800
patterns sound like in your head, that's what you're going to have to do with this DDR thing

2250
02:48:33,800 --> 02:48:37,480
is play the song over and over in regular mode and hear the pattern of the steps in

2251
02:48:37,480 --> 02:48:41,520
your head and then of course then again if it's a song he hasn't unlocked yet, I guess

2252
02:48:41,520 --> 02:48:42,520
you're just fucked.

2253
02:48:42,520 --> 02:48:44,520
Sorry, I don't know what to tell you.

2254
02:48:44,520 --> 02:48:47,520
Break, by the way, is when the arrows slow down as they reach the top.

2255
02:48:47,520 --> 02:48:50,520
It's the reverse of Boost.

2256
02:48:50,520 --> 02:48:58,520
Bugged wants to know, what fuck-ass games have you had the joy of playing as of late?

2257
02:48:58,520 --> 02:48:59,520
None.

2258
02:48:59,520 --> 02:49:01,520
I played Pack and Roll earlier today. It was kind of cool.

2259
02:49:01,520 --> 02:49:03,520
I'll talk about that more on the podcast.

2260
02:49:03,520 --> 02:49:06,520
I kind of remember the last video game I played.

2261
02:49:06,520 --> 02:49:08,520
Didn't I make you play something?

2262
02:49:08,520 --> 02:49:10,520
Sweaty Balls of the Game.

2263
02:49:10,520 --> 02:49:17,520
as in the white mage is the bitch, the game

2264
02:49:40,520 --> 02:49:47,520
The other day I was telling Helen Keller jokes to Loki and his fiance and they just loved it.

2265
02:49:47,520 --> 02:49:50,520
It wasn't even funnier because I was partially drunk.

2266
02:49:50,520 --> 02:49:53,520
It's the funniest I've seen you in a while.

2267
02:49:53,520 --> 02:49:56,520
Dark Sakura, I know, because I can't be funny unless I'm ripping off other people's jokes.

2268
02:49:56,520 --> 02:49:57,520
That's true.

2269
02:49:57,520 --> 02:49:59,520
Dark Sakura, we need a Your Mama joke of the week.

2270
02:49:59,520 --> 02:50:01,520
Give me a second.

2271
02:50:01,520 --> 02:50:02,520
Okay, you need to work on that.

2272
02:50:02,520 --> 02:50:10,140
Dark Tetsuya wants to know, will Sky's voice, the video game, ever return or is it doomed

2273
02:50:10,140 --> 02:50:11,480
to obscurity?

2274
02:50:11,480 --> 02:50:13,060
My friend, it is doomed to obscurity.

2275
02:50:13,060 --> 02:50:14,060
What?

2276
02:50:14,060 --> 02:50:16,500
It's an inside joke from like two and a half years ago on this.

2277
02:50:16,500 --> 02:50:21,220
I used to get on the, we used to do, before we were a real structured station, not that

2278
02:50:21,220 --> 02:50:26,220
we ever have been a structured station, but Dark Soccer and I used to do what was called

2279
02:50:26,220 --> 02:50:28,860
fuck off shows where we would just randomly get on the stream.

2280
02:50:28,860 --> 02:50:30,100
We didn't have scheduled programs.

2281
02:50:30,100 --> 02:50:34,480
We would just randomly, like it could be midnight on a Tuesday night, we would just randomly

2282
02:50:34,480 --> 02:50:37,980
get on the stream and kick everyone off and go live and do our own show, just play music

2283
02:50:37,980 --> 02:50:40,080
we wanted to play and do whatever the fuck we wanted.

2284
02:50:40,080 --> 02:50:43,280
So we called it the Fuck Off Show, because if you didn't like what we were doing, you

2285
02:50:43,280 --> 02:50:45,180
could fuck off.

2286
02:50:45,180 --> 02:50:48,960
And I used to get on there and I would sing my own versions of Bobani songs, like I had

2287
02:50:48,960 --> 02:50:51,380
my own version of Cowgirl and other things.

2288
02:50:51,380 --> 02:50:54,580
So I think they're wondering if I'm going to do that again, and the answer is no.

2289
02:50:54,580 --> 02:50:56,780
Okay, I have one.

2290
02:50:56,780 --> 02:50:57,780
What?

2291
02:50:57,780 --> 02:51:00,080
Um, your momma says stupid, that's what-

2292
02:51:00,080 --> 02:51:01,780
Wait, wait, wait, I need the music. I need the music.

2293
02:51:01,780 --> 02:51:02,780
Oh, fine.

2294
02:51:02,780 --> 02:51:05,280
I need to hype this up.

2295
02:51:05,280 --> 02:51:09,280
Oh, we have a- oh, I have never heard that Helen Keller joke before in the chatroom there.

2296
02:51:09,280 --> 02:51:13,280
Uh, what did Helen Keller do when she fell off a cliff?

2297
02:51:13,280 --> 02:51:15,280
She screamed her hands off.

2298
02:51:15,280 --> 02:51:16,780
Uh...

2299
02:51:16,780 --> 02:51:18,280
Hahahaha.

2300
02:51:18,280 --> 02:51:19,780
Oh, yeah.

2301
02:51:19,780 --> 02:51:20,780
Hahahaha.

2302
02:51:20,780 --> 02:51:22,780
We're gonna get some angry emails.

2303
02:51:22,780 --> 02:51:24,280
That's alright.

2304
02:51:24,280 --> 02:51:26,780
That's what we do here on the, uh, show.

2305
02:51:26,780 --> 02:51:30,780
Alright, uh, wait, hold on. I wasn't ready to do a Yo Mama Joke of the Week.

2306
02:51:30,780 --> 02:51:32,780
Let's go to your Big Boobs 1 icon.

2307
02:51:32,780 --> 02:51:36,780
Yeah, you probably hit all my music in the Big Boobs folder.

2308
02:51:36,780 --> 02:51:38,780
Peeing in glass bowls or whatever the shit you...

2309
02:51:38,780 --> 02:51:39,780
It's women on stage.

2310
02:51:39,780 --> 02:51:42,780
I'm gonna make out for it by saying a couple of them.

2311
02:51:42,780 --> 02:51:44,780
Alright, kids.

2312
02:51:48,780 --> 02:51:52,780
It's Dark Sakura's Yo Mama Joke of the Week.

2313
02:51:52,780 --> 02:51:53,780
Dark Sakura.

2314
02:51:53,780 --> 02:51:54,780
I have a couple.

2315
02:51:54,780 --> 02:51:59,780
Yo mama so stupid, I told her drinks were on the house so she went and got a ladder.

2316
02:52:02,780 --> 02:52:03,780
And my other one?

2317
02:52:04,780 --> 02:52:07,780
Yo mama so stupid, she took the Pepsi challenge and chose Coke.

2318
02:52:11,780 --> 02:52:14,780
I saw that joke growing because I meant to be Mountain Dew.

2319
02:52:14,780 --> 02:52:19,780
hahahahahahaha

2320
02:52:19,780 --> 02:52:23,780
uh... yo mama so stupid she reckoned a quarterback was a refund

2321
02:52:23,780 --> 02:52:28,780
hahahahahahahahaha

2322
02:52:28,780 --> 02:52:30,780
you're laughing at yourself

2323
02:52:30,780 --> 02:52:33,780
uh... yo mama so stupid she sold her car for gas money

2324
02:52:33,780 --> 02:52:37,780
alright that was like seven yo mama jokes you do one a week here

2325
02:52:37,780 --> 02:52:38,780
I got more

2326
02:52:38,780 --> 02:52:40,780
hell I'm gonna sell my mama for gas money

2327
02:52:40,780 --> 02:52:42,780
alright this one's the best but it's really disgusting

2328
02:52:42,780 --> 02:52:43,780
save it for next week

2329
02:52:43,780 --> 02:52:45,780
I'm gonna tell it right now!

2330
02:52:45,780 --> 02:52:46,780
Nevermind.

2331
02:52:46,780 --> 02:52:48,780
No, tell it right now.

2332
02:52:48,780 --> 02:52:50,780
I promise I won't laugh.

2333
02:52:50,780 --> 02:52:53,780
Yamalasistupu, when you were born, she looked at your umbilical cord and said,

2334
02:52:53,780 --> 02:52:55,780
Well, come to the cable.

2335
02:52:57,780 --> 02:52:59,780
ColorOfSakura wants to know,

2336
02:52:59,780 --> 02:53:04,780
If you could remake any video game from the 16-bit era or earlier, what would it be?

2337
02:53:04,780 --> 02:53:06,780
Guardian Legend!

2338
02:53:06,780 --> 02:53:08,780
Street Fighter 2!

2339
02:53:08,780 --> 02:53:09,780
Repeat the question.

2340
02:53:09,780 --> 02:53:12,780
If you could remake any video game from the 16-bit era or earlier, what would it be?

2341
02:53:12,780 --> 02:53:13,780
or what would it be?

2342
02:53:13,780 --> 02:53:14,780
Kid Icarus.

2343
02:53:14,780 --> 02:53:15,780
I'll say something different then.

2344
02:53:15,780 --> 02:53:16,780
Custer's Revenge.

2345
02:53:16,780 --> 02:53:21,820
You said Street Fighter II, man.

2346
02:53:21,820 --> 02:53:26,340
X-Man.

2347
02:53:26,340 --> 02:53:30,580
I think that they've already remade all the games that I like.

2348
02:53:30,580 --> 02:53:33,020
Oregon Trail.

2349
02:53:33,020 --> 02:53:35,420
You know, like Metroid.

2350
02:53:35,420 --> 02:53:39,620
And the last question we have tonight, Nince wants to know, will Loki singing ever come

2351
02:53:39,620 --> 02:53:42,140
back to the show?

2352
02:53:42,140 --> 02:53:45,140
We actually have to wait for Karaoke Revolution Party to come out, so...

2353
02:53:45,140 --> 02:53:51,140
I hope not, and we don't really have the setup for that, luckily, so, hahaha.

2354
02:53:51,140 --> 02:53:53,140
Well, we can always make it happen.

2355
02:53:53,140 --> 02:53:54,140
No, you can't.

2356
02:53:54,140 --> 02:53:56,140
I think that you should play I'm Stayin' In.

2357
02:53:56,140 --> 02:53:59,140
I don't know if I have it anymore, I gotta dig for it.

2358
02:53:59,140 --> 02:54:01,140
I used to have it somewhere.

2359
02:54:01,140 --> 02:54:04,140
We gotta do a retrospective episode at the end of the year or something, and we'll do it on that.

2360
02:54:04,140 --> 02:54:06,140
What, Logie? What?

2361
02:54:06,140 --> 02:54:10,140
I know where I should put that song, even though I don't want to put that song there.

2362
02:54:10,140 --> 02:54:11,140
Hmm.

2363
02:54:11,140 --> 02:54:14,300
on the thing. Oh, the thing, yeah. Yeah.

2364
02:54:14,300 --> 02:54:19,340
Um, actually it's being suggested by our chat room that we could just use the demo

2365
02:54:19,340 --> 02:54:23,620
in DDR to make, um, Loki sing some crazy in love.

2366
02:54:23,620 --> 02:54:28,660
There's also, um, SingStar, which I have on my hard drive. There you go!

2367
02:54:28,660 --> 02:54:31,920
See, we could do this. We need to get you to sing again.

2368
02:54:31,920 --> 02:54:36,460
We could always pre-record it, you know. You know what we should do is get Loki to go to one of

2369
02:54:36,460 --> 02:54:38,820
those recording studios that they have at the theme park

2370
02:54:38,820 --> 02:54:43,300
and cut his own CD because I did that once and the old radio program I was on

2371
02:54:43,300 --> 02:54:44,460
years ago before the show

2372
02:54:44,460 --> 02:54:47,980
I remember that, I was there. Yeah, I went to Great America,

2373
02:54:47,980 --> 02:54:52,180
Six Flags, oh no it's not Six Flags, it's Paramount's Great America.

2374
02:54:52,180 --> 02:54:55,900
We went to see Margaret Cho. Yeah, it was Paramount's Great America, it was years ago,

2375
02:54:55,900 --> 02:54:59,500
it was Gay Day at Great America. I got hit on by girls in the bathroom.

2376
02:54:59,500 --> 02:55:04,140
Because it was Gay Day and so you know Dark Soccer being one of my fag hags, she had to go

2377
02:55:04,140 --> 02:55:08,660
and we went and there was one of those rooms where you could record your own

2378
02:55:08,660 --> 02:55:14,700
CD. I've been in those things before. I sang Like a Prayer by Madonna. I sang Save the

2379
02:55:14,700 --> 02:55:24,700
Best for Last by what's-her-name. Penthouse model, American beauty queen. Vanessa Williams.

2380
02:55:24,700 --> 02:55:33,940
So, I recorded this song and then somehow the CD fell into the hands of Travis, who

2381
02:55:33,940 --> 02:55:38,280
was the host over on Understation Live, and every week he would play that song to make

2382
02:55:38,280 --> 02:55:46,760
fun of it so I don't know alright I think it's about time to wrap up the

2383
02:55:46,760 --> 02:55:52,240
show boys and girls we're done shows over I know sadness huh first off all

02:56:01,480 --> 02:56:04,840

2387
02:56:04,840 --> 02:56:07,160
we should add you on permanently, and to that I say...

2388
02:56:07,160 --> 02:56:12,160
You gave us the bleached asshole joke. What was that?

2389
02:56:12,160 --> 02:56:16,800
You gave us the bleached asshole joke. I did give you that bleached asshole joke.

2390
02:56:16,800 --> 02:56:23,800
And taking immense pride over that. That is really funny. Keep doing that.

2391
02:56:24,160 --> 02:56:27,400
Alright, let's go around. I am going to choke that ferret.

2392
02:56:27,400 --> 02:56:31,840
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

2393
02:56:31,840 --> 02:56:37,600
We sent Zero on fire and sent him back to his flea infested- I'm sorry, did I say that

2394
02:56:37,600 --> 02:56:38,600
on the air?

2395
02:56:38,600 --> 02:56:41,240
We sent him back to live in a hole.

2396
02:56:41,240 --> 02:56:45,520
Xtavor, your final thought.

2397
02:56:45,520 --> 02:56:51,400
Akira Yamamoka should be a drink called Akira Yamamoka.

2398
02:56:51,400 --> 02:56:58,440
Wait, did I pronounce his name right?

2399
02:56:58,440 --> 02:56:59,720
I hate you.

2400
02:56:59,720 --> 02:57:05,040
uh... loki your final thought

2401
02:57:05,040 --> 02:57:09,400
except for a hand on the god damn microphone

2402
02:57:09,400 --> 02:57:11,840
loki turn on the god damn microphone

2403
02:57:11,840 --> 02:57:13,520
it's all his fault

2404
02:57:13,520 --> 02:57:17,120
this is why you're never going to be on the show, never

2405
02:57:17,120 --> 02:57:19,720
ever ever

2406
02:57:19,720 --> 02:57:24,000
no one can hear you because you don't have the microphone

2407
02:57:24,000 --> 02:57:26,320
my final thought is uh...

2408
02:57:26,320 --> 02:57:29,620
to finish the thing but it's done pretty much

2409
02:57:29,620 --> 02:57:32,620

2419
02:57:52,340 --> 02:57:54,860
