[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Rob Roberts.

21
00:03:25,172 --> 00:03:26,293
[SPEAKER_02]: You might know me as Sky.

24
00:03:33,935 --> 00:03:34,595
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got legs.

25
00:03:35,455 --> 00:03:36,215
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got legs?

26
00:03:36,235 --> 00:03:37,356
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you like bread?

27
00:03:38,877 --> 00:03:40,338
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you say you got legs?

28
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:41,439
[SPEAKER_02]: I have legs.

29
00:03:41,779 --> 00:03:43,821
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, that's good.

30
00:03:43,921 --> 00:03:46,743
[SPEAKER_17]: I was listening to some of my Eddie Izzard stuff before I left.

31
00:03:46,864 --> 00:03:49,306
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially if you're trying to play DDR, legs are a good thing.

32
00:03:50,106 --> 00:03:50,386
[SPEAKER_17]: No.

33
00:03:50,847 --> 00:03:52,548
[SPEAKER_17]: There are people without legs who play DDR.

34
00:03:53,469 --> 00:03:54,610
[SPEAKER_17]: Or at least who were watching them.

35
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:56,371
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you play DDR without legs?

36
00:03:56,411 --> 00:03:59,414
[SPEAKER_17]: There was a guy who played with the crutches and did a free show.

37
00:03:59,574 --> 00:04:03,277
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, that infamous video on the intranet.

38
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:05,819
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

39
00:04:06,846 --> 00:04:10,467
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, also not here tonight, just yet, is Loki.

40
00:04:11,328 --> 00:04:13,408
[SPEAKER_02]: He's actually running a little bit tardy tonight.

41
00:04:13,989 --> 00:04:15,269
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what that means, kids.

42
00:04:15,729 --> 00:04:19,010
[SPEAKER_02]: FIRED!

43
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:19,911
[SPEAKER_02]: He'll be here soon enough.

44
00:04:20,271 --> 00:04:23,232
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually, we're kind of bummed because we don't have any special guests tonight.

45
00:04:24,412 --> 00:04:26,173
[SPEAKER_02]: There's us, and we're special enough.

46
00:04:26,353 --> 00:04:28,894
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's just the three of us, and of course your calls on the skyplane.

47
00:04:29,014 --> 00:04:31,115
[SPEAKER_17]: No, we have somebody who's returned to the show.

48
00:04:31,255 --> 00:04:31,995
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, goody, who?

49
00:04:32,495 --> 00:04:32,815
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

50
00:04:35,489 --> 00:04:39,570
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot to tell you what I found this week after incessant listener demand.

51
00:04:41,451 --> 00:04:42,191
[SPEAKER_02]: We dug him up.

52
00:04:43,392 --> 00:04:43,652
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

53
00:04:46,593 --> 00:04:47,633
[SPEAKER_02]: So Loki will be here soon enough.

54
00:04:47,733 --> 00:05:02,078
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually what's kind of sad is that Miklatov, one of our regular guests, was just here not even an hour ago and was going to stay for the show but unfortunately due to some commuting issues had to get back before the show started.

55
00:05:02,178 --> 00:05:04,499
[SPEAKER_02]: So he says hi and I guess

56
00:05:04,864 --> 00:05:06,125
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

57
00:05:31,952 --> 00:05:34,494
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, I'm going to tell you, you may not want to listen tonight.

58
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:36,656
[SPEAKER_02]: But honestly, there's some real good stuff.

59
00:05:37,377 --> 00:05:38,138
[SPEAKER_02]: Just stick with it.

60
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:46,245
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm assuming that a lot of people out there who were trying to really stay careful of the spoilers probably...

61
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,322
[SPEAKER_02]: Have either already unlocked this stuff for themselves by now or just, you know, don't care at this point.

62
00:05:51,382 --> 00:05:51,663
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

63
00:05:52,063 --> 00:05:57,626
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just want to warn you guys, we are going to talk about and probably play some music that is unlockable in DDR Extreme 2.

64
00:05:57,666 --> 00:06:00,947
[SPEAKER_02]: So you guys, it might be a spoiler, but who cares?

65
00:06:01,288 --> 00:06:02,808
[SPEAKER_02]: The game's been out for several days now.

66
00:06:03,929 --> 00:06:04,509
[SPEAKER_02]: We can spoil.

67
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:07,251
[SPEAKER_17]: If they don't want the spoiler, they can all go see Serenity.

68
00:06:08,271 --> 00:06:11,413
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, we'll talk about... So that it can make the 80 million and we get a sequel.

69
00:06:11,693 --> 00:06:12,874
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll talk about Serenity, yes.

70
00:06:13,877 --> 00:06:16,658
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll talk about other stuff, too.

71
00:06:16,718 --> 00:06:18,838
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to talk about that big, big secret.

72
00:06:19,378 --> 00:06:20,438
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's not really a secret.

73
00:06:20,798 --> 00:06:34,461
[SPEAKER_02]: It's out there, and people have been wanting this in a Bomani game for so, so long, and it's out there, and nobody... I know somebody found it, because people were talking about it, but nobody I know knew about this, really, except Miklatov, who pointed it out to me.

74
00:06:34,521 --> 00:06:37,682
[SPEAKER_02]: But we will talk about all that after this break, kids.

75
00:06:38,422 --> 00:06:38,622
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

76
00:06:39,775 --> 00:06:40,155
[SPEAKER_02]: DDR Extreme 2 Music

77
00:07:21,438 --> 00:07:47,214
[SPEAKER_09]: We drift deeper and life goes on We drift deeper into the sound Traveling somewhere, could be anywhere There's a coldness in the air, but I don't care

78
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:06,272
[SPEAKER_09]: Back with another one of those block rockin' beats!

79
00:11:28,849 --> 00:11:29,670
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

80
00:13:54,884 --> 00:13:58,747
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Lounge Radio, Bomani Music, and more.

81
00:14:02,849 --> 00:14:04,891
[SPEAKER_02]: We're back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

82
00:14:05,491 --> 00:14:08,093
[SPEAKER_02]: We are in the midst of our October 2nd episode.

83
00:14:08,133 --> 00:14:09,254
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, we are live here.

84
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:12,616
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is episode number, what, 158?

85
00:14:13,336 --> 00:14:14,017
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm starting to lose count.

86
00:14:14,037 --> 00:14:14,677
[SPEAKER_02]: We're getting so high.

87
00:14:14,697 --> 00:14:15,097
[SPEAKER_02]: We're old.

88
00:14:15,257 --> 00:14:15,918
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, God.

89
00:14:17,099 --> 00:14:18,220
[SPEAKER_17]: We have to keep innovating.

90
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:20,501
[SPEAKER_02]: We're what, like three and a half years old now?

91
00:14:20,741 --> 00:14:21,662
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, something like that.

92
00:14:21,682 --> 00:14:24,964
[SPEAKER_02]: We're pretty well potty trained at this point, and we're going to start preschool soon.

93
00:14:25,244 --> 00:14:27,145
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

94
00:14:27,206 --> 00:14:29,687
[SPEAKER_17]: We don't have to use the big kids' pants anymore.

95
00:14:29,707 --> 00:14:31,248
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right, we have like pull-ups.

96
00:14:33,029 --> 00:14:34,870
[SPEAKER_17]: Mommy, wow, I'm a big kid now.

97
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:37,112
[SPEAKER_02]: Occasionally we still do have an accident or two.

98
00:14:39,659 --> 00:14:44,024
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, in that break you did hear some music from Dance Dance Revolution Extreme 2.

99
00:14:44,324 --> 00:14:50,490
[SPEAKER_02]: You heard As the Rush Comes, Block Rockin' Beats, Genie in a Bottle, and I Will Survive.

100
00:14:52,792 --> 00:14:54,454
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, you didn't really get a chance to.

101
00:14:54,474 --> 00:14:56,156
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I know you're eating cake over there.

102
00:14:56,356 --> 00:14:57,197
[SPEAKER_17]: Let them eat cake.

103
00:14:57,758 --> 00:14:58,979
[SPEAKER_17]: No one's supposed to know I'm cheating.

104
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:00,520
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my bad.

105
00:15:01,121 --> 00:15:01,982
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody listens to this show.

106
00:15:02,022 --> 00:15:02,362
[SPEAKER_02]: It's okay.

107
00:15:04,642 --> 00:15:05,363
[SPEAKER_02]: No, just kidding.

108
00:15:05,503 --> 00:15:06,024
[SPEAKER_02]: Just kidding.

109
00:15:06,064 --> 00:15:06,645
[SPEAKER_02]: Tons and tons.

110
00:15:06,945 --> 00:15:09,969
[SPEAKER_02]: Hundreds upon hundreds of people want to listen to this show.

111
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:11,791
[SPEAKER_02]: And a couple do.

112
00:15:12,172 --> 00:15:16,076
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're in our chat room, www.orangeloungeradio.com.

113
00:15:16,157 --> 00:15:17,358
[SPEAKER_02]: Click on Interact With Us.

114
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,182
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, that's for the Skype line.

115
00:15:20,202 --> 00:15:20,903
[SPEAKER_02]: Click on Chat.

116
00:15:22,244 --> 00:15:23,566
[SPEAKER_02]: This is going to be one of those nights tonight.

117
00:15:24,202 --> 00:15:28,066
[SPEAKER_02]: Click on chat and you can join our chat room and there's a whole bunch of fun people in there.

118
00:15:28,626 --> 00:15:29,647
[SPEAKER_02]: What are they talking about right now?

119
00:15:30,548 --> 00:15:33,631
[SPEAKER_02]: I think some comments there on some of the songs.

120
00:15:34,131 --> 00:15:36,393
[SPEAKER_17]: Except for the Akira Moka one.

121
00:15:37,051 --> 00:15:38,072
[SPEAKER_02]: We're assuming it's Akira.

122
00:15:38,092 --> 00:15:40,234
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't really know because the saying Akira... The beat was cool.

123
00:15:41,034 --> 00:15:43,256
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see how it couldn't be Akira Yamaoka, honestly.

124
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:46,579
[SPEAKER_17]: The beat was cool, although it's like I'm very picky about that song.

125
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:47,640
[SPEAKER_02]: And that would have been I Will Survive.

126
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:51,023
[SPEAKER_17]: But the Genie in the Bottle one made me feel highly nauseous.

127
00:15:51,203 --> 00:15:54,746
[SPEAKER_02]: Genie in the Bottle's been a very split down the middle one in the community.

128
00:15:54,786 --> 00:15:58,449
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, I've been reading a lot of feedback, not just on our forums over at Orange Lodge Radio, but the more...

129
00:15:59,158 --> 00:15:59,878
[SPEAKER_02]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft,

130
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:34,989
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, now you didn't really get a chance to check out Dance Dance Revolution Extreme 2, did you Jamie?

131
00:16:35,009 --> 00:16:37,471
[SPEAKER_17]: You haven't really... When I have no life.

132
00:16:38,992 --> 00:16:39,152
[SPEAKER_17]: No.

133
00:16:40,914 --> 00:16:43,076
[SPEAKER_02]: I did, I ran out and got it on Tuesday.

134
00:16:43,396 --> 00:16:48,040
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to wait for Loki to get here because I think he's been playing it too, so I'll wait and share my thoughts with him.

135
00:16:48,121 --> 00:16:54,126
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the meantime, let's go ahead and start off tonight's show as we do every week, playing a little bit of How Was Your Cake?

136
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:54,787
[SPEAKER_02]: How Was Your Day?

137
00:16:54,807 --> 00:16:55,127
[SPEAKER_02]: How Was Your Day?

138
00:16:55,788 --> 00:16:58,349
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll start it off with the one and only DarkSakura.

139
00:16:58,589 --> 00:17:01,390
[SPEAKER_17]: The sugar is burning a path down my throat like vodka.

140
00:17:04,131 --> 00:17:06,131
[SPEAKER_17]: I played Nintendogs, lots and lots of puppies.

141
00:17:07,112 --> 00:17:07,592
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's it.

142
00:17:08,792 --> 00:17:09,952
[SPEAKER_17]: I didn't even touch World of Warcraft.

143
00:17:11,153 --> 00:17:14,374
[SPEAKER_17]: Although we did have a very nerdly discussion Friday night after Serenity.

144
00:17:15,254 --> 00:17:16,614
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my gosh.

145
00:17:17,635 --> 00:17:20,256
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we were starting to talk about games for a little while.

146
00:17:20,296 --> 00:17:20,956
[SPEAKER_02]: We were talking about...

147
00:17:22,578 --> 00:17:23,378
[SPEAKER_02]: God, what were we talking about?

148
00:17:23,398 --> 00:17:25,500
[SPEAKER_02]: Just different DDRs and stuff.

149
00:17:26,061 --> 00:17:28,022
[SPEAKER_02]: And our various MMOs.

150
00:17:28,362 --> 00:17:28,723
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

151
00:17:29,043 --> 00:17:35,449
[SPEAKER_02]: Various MMOs that we've played, like Ragnarok and Final Fantasy XI and World of Warcraft and City of Heroes and all this other stuff.

152
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:43,796
[SPEAKER_02]: We were talking about all those games, and one of my poor friends who isn't much of a gamer was just kind of sitting there going, blink, blink, blink.

153
00:17:44,216 --> 00:17:46,098
[SPEAKER_02]: And this was also like his birthday dinner, so...

154
00:17:46,843 --> 00:17:51,524
[SPEAKER_17]: I only got onto the Angel discussion and Buffy.

155
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:59,325
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, then you guys started talking about Buffy and Angel all night, and then that was the part where I started going blink, blink, blink, because I'm not much of a Joss Whedon whore.

156
00:17:59,706 --> 00:18:05,087
[SPEAKER_02]: Granted, I did go out and see Serenity, because I was essentially dragged by all my friends who are Joss Whedon whores.

157
00:18:05,927 --> 00:18:06,467
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was cool.

158
00:18:06,667 --> 00:18:07,327
[SPEAKER_02]: I like Serenity.

159
00:18:07,607 --> 00:18:12,508
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not like OMFG Serenity, like I'm going to make all my LJ icons Serenity-based.

160
00:18:12,668 --> 00:18:14,670
[SPEAKER_17]: I have a Serenity icon, okay?

161
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:16,211
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just teasing the general.

162
00:18:16,471 --> 00:18:19,374
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I just noticed this huge influx this past couple weeks.

163
00:18:19,394 --> 00:18:23,317
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just Serenity whoredom amongst the nerds on my LJ list, which is cool.

164
00:18:23,657 --> 00:18:32,264
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, God knows I have my nerdy things as well, so I'm not one to judge, but I just noticed that the past two weeks, you know, have been like, Serenity thing's been on overdrive.

165
00:18:32,644 --> 00:18:35,146
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not like OMFG over the movie, but it was good.

166
00:18:35,327 --> 00:18:36,367
[SPEAKER_02]: It was cool.

167
00:18:37,689 --> 00:18:39,570
[SPEAKER_02]: I liked the action scenes.

168
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:40,551
[SPEAKER_02]: It was action-packed.

169
00:18:42,327 --> 00:18:44,789
[SPEAKER_17]: I liked that part at the end.

170
00:18:45,269 --> 00:18:46,830
[SPEAKER_02]: And I liked the black chick with a gun.

171
00:18:47,731 --> 00:18:48,291
[SPEAKER_17]: She was cool.

172
00:18:49,412 --> 00:18:49,733
[SPEAKER_17]: Zoe.

173
00:18:49,793 --> 00:18:51,174
[SPEAKER_02]: Because black chick with guns are cool.

174
00:18:52,054 --> 00:18:52,374
[SPEAKER_02]: They are?

175
00:18:54,476 --> 00:18:56,457
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, that's my opinion on Serenity.

176
00:18:57,278 --> 00:18:58,659
[SPEAKER_17]: And Rob's movie review.

177
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:02,762
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we actually have Extra for here, and he's going to give his movie review a little later in the show.

178
00:19:03,303 --> 00:19:05,124
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's actually sitting in Loki's chair.

179
00:19:05,384 --> 00:19:06,345
[SPEAKER_17]: You're our new co-host now.

180
00:19:07,366 --> 00:19:10,048
[SPEAKER_02]: If we fire Loki, you're going to have to step in here.

181
00:19:10,068 --> 00:19:10,368
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

182
00:19:10,468 --> 00:19:10,648
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

183
00:19:11,152 --> 00:19:13,273
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate Macs and in the groove.

184
00:19:13,313 --> 00:19:13,953
[SPEAKER_17]: There you go.

185
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:15,674
[SPEAKER_16]: He fits right in.

186
00:19:15,754 --> 00:19:16,295
[SPEAKER_16]: I love it.

187
00:19:18,636 --> 00:19:19,236
[SPEAKER_17]: I have a Mac now.

188
00:19:19,276 --> 00:19:19,856
[SPEAKER_16]: Is that a Mac?

189
00:19:20,177 --> 00:19:20,837
[SPEAKER_16]: I hate you.

190
00:19:21,757 --> 00:19:22,678
[SPEAKER_17]: I have a Mac now.

191
00:19:23,418 --> 00:19:27,240
[SPEAKER_17]: I have an iMac that I named Easy Mac.

192
00:19:28,261 --> 00:19:28,901
[SPEAKER_16]: That's cool.

193
00:19:30,162 --> 00:19:33,263
[SPEAKER_17]: It's the graphite one, so it fits in with my dark personality.

194
00:19:34,724 --> 00:19:35,985
[SPEAKER_02]: Extra, for what games do you play?

195
00:19:36,745 --> 00:19:39,186
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you play the DDR games at all?

196
00:19:39,646 --> 00:19:39,666
[SPEAKER_16]: I...

197
00:19:41,286 --> 00:19:43,087
[SPEAKER_16]: Enjoy watching people play them.

198
00:19:43,248 --> 00:19:44,068
[SPEAKER_16]: I like Pump It Up.

199
00:19:45,529 --> 00:19:51,634
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I do, because as a person who's not very good at DDR, it felt more natural.

200
00:19:52,154 --> 00:19:53,976
[SPEAKER_16]: Pump It Up felt more natural for me.

201
00:19:55,537 --> 00:20:00,421
[SPEAKER_02]: That's interesting, because I think in a lot of ways Pump It Up is actually a harder game, even to pick up and learn.

202
00:20:00,441 --> 00:20:03,123
[SPEAKER_02]: I think DDR is a little more beginner-friendly than Pump It Up.

203
00:20:03,143 --> 00:20:06,405
[SPEAKER_02]: Not to knock Pump It Up, I just don't see it as beginner-friendly.

204
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:07,606
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know.

205
00:20:07,726 --> 00:20:09,848
[SPEAKER_16]: I just don't have that...

206
00:20:10,999 --> 00:20:12,079
[SPEAKER_16]: Why is Fiona Apple on Myspace?

207
00:20:32,207 --> 00:20:36,070
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for completely derailing our previous topic.

208
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:36,730
[SPEAKER_02]: That's alright.

209
00:20:54,182 --> 00:20:55,923
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, come check out our show.

210
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:58,844
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they like paste a huge ass image of a flyer.

211
00:20:59,245 --> 00:21:00,985
[SPEAKER_02]: This is my sister's MySpace for you guys.

212
00:21:01,005 --> 00:21:03,467
[SPEAKER_02]: Because my sister is like the biggest MySpace whore I know.

213
00:21:03,487 --> 00:21:06,888
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, my sister has over 1,000 friends on MySpace.

214
00:21:07,048 --> 00:21:07,589
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not even kidding.

215
00:21:07,609 --> 00:21:09,029
[SPEAKER_02]: She has over 1,000 friends.

216
00:21:09,089 --> 00:21:09,410
[SPEAKER_17]: I have 64.

217
00:21:11,229 --> 00:21:11,729
[SPEAKER_02]: and I have 227.

218
00:21:12,089 --> 00:21:13,930
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not going to go there.

219
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:19,831
[SPEAKER_17]: And I've posted about 10 entries since I've had my... I don't post any entries.

220
00:21:19,871 --> 00:21:20,452
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't either.

221
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:21,672
[SPEAKER_02]: I just have my profile.

222
00:21:21,892 --> 00:21:23,733
[SPEAKER_02]: I have my live journal to post entries.

223
00:21:23,753 --> 00:21:26,213
[SPEAKER_02]: And my sexy MySpace emo pics, which reminds me.

224
00:21:27,114 --> 00:21:32,335
[SPEAKER_02]: Last night, me, Extifer, John, and Precious Amanda were all here last night.

225
00:21:34,006 --> 00:21:37,508
[SPEAKER_02]: See, you kind of have the emo pic thing going on, on your MySpace.

226
00:21:37,809 --> 00:21:38,809
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a good emo pic.

227
00:21:38,949 --> 00:21:41,151
[SPEAKER_02]: Every MySpace profile, we're talking about MySpace.

228
00:21:41,211 --> 00:21:43,052
[SPEAKER_17]: That's me holding the camera over my head.

229
00:21:43,192 --> 00:21:46,474
[SPEAKER_02]: See, that's the way to take an emo pic, is take a picture of yourself.

230
00:21:47,455 --> 00:21:52,658
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were actually taking emo pics last night, because I think John was borrowing his parents' digital camera, which is kind of nice.

231
00:21:53,058 --> 00:21:55,860
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were taking pictures of ourselves.

232
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:59,182
[SPEAKER_02]: We were doing that thing where you take a picture of yourself in the bathroom mirror.

233
00:21:59,662 --> 00:22:03,944
[SPEAKER_02]: and you're like half flexing and you look really like sad, like you're going to cry.

234
00:22:04,645 --> 00:22:08,247
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you just listened to an entire Linkin Park album or something.

235
00:22:08,347 --> 00:22:12,189
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Evanescence, you know, and then you're sad inside.

236
00:22:12,229 --> 00:22:13,730
[SPEAKER_16]: But Evanescence makes me happy.

237
00:22:15,471 --> 00:22:16,111
[SPEAKER_16]: Sarcasm.

238
00:22:17,372 --> 00:22:26,797
[SPEAKER_16]: No, you know, Amanda and I, we were trying to do an emo pic where we were both in the bathroom and she was holding up the camera and taking a picture of us, which is funny because, you know, that way...

239
00:22:28,322 --> 00:22:29,743
[SPEAKER_16]: Why would a person do that?

240
00:22:29,903 --> 00:22:30,944
[SPEAKER_16]: Which makes it funny.

241
00:22:32,105 --> 00:22:32,946
[SPEAKER_16]: I like that one better.

242
00:22:33,406 --> 00:22:36,929
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm waiting to see how my emo pics turn out.

243
00:22:37,009 --> 00:22:38,190
[SPEAKER_02]: But I will put them on my MySpace.

244
00:22:38,491 --> 00:22:42,014
[SPEAKER_02]: And by the way, kids, Orange Lounge Radio has hopped on the MySpace bandwagon.

245
00:22:42,054 --> 00:22:42,514
[SPEAKER_02]: Toot toot!

246
00:22:43,135 --> 00:22:47,198
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've got a club thingy on there.

247
00:22:47,238 --> 00:22:48,759
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't really done anything with it yet.

248
00:22:50,341 --> 00:22:51,182
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's there.

249
00:22:51,462 --> 00:22:52,122
[SPEAKER_02]: And join it.

250
00:22:52,142 --> 00:22:54,524
[SPEAKER_02]: Because when a lot of people are in the club, then they'll go, Hey!

251
00:22:55,444 --> 00:22:57,305
[SPEAKER_02]: Why are all my friends in this Orange Lounge Radio Club?

252
00:22:57,325 --> 00:23:00,186
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they'll be likely to check out our station and our podcast.

253
00:23:00,487 --> 00:23:01,447
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we get popular.

254
00:23:01,827 --> 00:23:03,908
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we can sell commercials on this program.

255
00:23:04,128 --> 00:23:06,490
[SPEAKER_02]: And we can all quit our day jobs and do Orange Lounge Radio forever.

256
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:07,530
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay!

257
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:09,511
[SPEAKER_17]: That means that I can't move.

258
00:23:12,232 --> 00:23:12,893
[SPEAKER_17]: But I'm not going to.

259
00:23:15,714 --> 00:23:16,014
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

260
00:23:17,055 --> 00:23:18,576
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, MySpace.com.

261
00:23:18,636 --> 00:23:21,137
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know how to access our club on MySpace.com.

262
00:23:21,157 --> 00:23:23,358
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's like MySpace.com slash...

263
00:23:23,834 --> 00:23:25,594
[SPEAKER_02]: Clubs slash Orange Lounge Radio or something.

264
00:23:25,854 --> 00:23:27,735
[SPEAKER_02]: Just do a search in the clubs for Orange Lounge Radio.

265
00:23:28,075 --> 00:23:31,556
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't imagine that there's like some other club named Orange Lounge Radio.

266
00:23:31,636 --> 00:23:36,677
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty sure we're the only club named Orange Lounge Radio because I can't think of anybody else that would call themselves Orange Lounge Radio.

267
00:23:36,877 --> 00:23:37,937
[SPEAKER_02]: So look for that.

268
00:23:39,158 --> 00:23:40,618
[SPEAKER_17]: So how was your gaming week, Rob?

269
00:23:41,498 --> 00:23:47,380
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'll talk about my gaming week on the podcast, but I'll talk about my regular week now.

270
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,060
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

271
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:50,700
[SPEAKER_02]: Just messing with you.

272
00:23:52,881 --> 00:23:53,421
[SPEAKER_02]: My week was

273
00:23:54,262 --> 00:24:01,805
[SPEAKER_02]: And I barely slept last night at all, and I took a big ol' nap today, so I didn't really do anything on my Sunday, which kinda sucks.

274
00:24:01,825 --> 00:24:02,325
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop laughing.

275
00:24:02,345 --> 00:24:05,687
[SPEAKER_16]: But you didn't do anything with your Sunday?

276
00:24:06,627 --> 00:24:08,248
[SPEAKER_02]: I went to Lions and ate.

277
00:24:09,408 --> 00:24:11,129
[SPEAKER_16]: But you didn't do anything else?

278
00:24:11,409 --> 00:24:12,109
[SPEAKER_16]: This program.

279
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:13,150
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, okay.

280
00:24:15,051 --> 00:24:17,392
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but this is nothing noteworthy.

281
00:24:18,372 --> 00:24:20,753
[SPEAKER_17]: I was starting to think that Rob was starting to do stuff like ice cream.

282
00:24:22,179 --> 00:24:22,620
[SPEAKER_02]: Ice cream?

283
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:23,500
[SPEAKER_02]: We have ice cream?

284
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,061
[SPEAKER_02]: Your sundae.

285
00:24:25,142 --> 00:24:26,623
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh my god, we should totally get ice cream.

286
00:24:27,064 --> 00:24:27,785
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, I totally want ice cream.

287
00:24:27,805 --> 00:24:28,185
[SPEAKER_02]: We should.

288
00:24:28,285 --> 00:24:30,187
[SPEAKER_02]: Except for when Loki gets here, you're our ice cream bitch.

289
00:24:30,207 --> 00:24:32,169
[SPEAKER_02]: You should go get us all Cold Stone.

290
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:33,931
[SPEAKER_16]: Should I really?

291
00:24:34,611 --> 00:24:35,572
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be awesome!

292
00:24:35,612 --> 00:24:36,473
[SPEAKER_17]: Except I have no money.

293
00:24:37,274 --> 00:24:38,555
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, I don't either.

294
00:24:38,755 --> 00:24:40,337
[SPEAKER_02]: Just get us a big tub of Ben & Jerry's.

295
00:24:41,938 --> 00:24:43,139
[SPEAKER_16]: A big tub of Ben & Jerry's?

296
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:43,380
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

297
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,662
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey, is my picture, does it look emo?

298
00:24:45,682 --> 00:24:45,722
[SPEAKER_16]: No.

299
00:24:46,581 --> 00:24:47,281
[SPEAKER_02]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

300
00:25:14,025 --> 00:25:15,166
[SPEAKER_02]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

301
00:25:35,856 --> 00:25:40,839
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody commented today that I look like I've lost weight, and I credit that to the three days of DDR I've been playing this week.

302
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:42,900
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just kidding.

303
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,502
[SPEAKER_02]: Not just for that, but I've been playing quite a bit of DDR and other stuff.

304
00:25:46,582 --> 00:25:47,283
[SPEAKER_16]: It doesn't show.

305
00:25:48,083 --> 00:25:48,483
[SPEAKER_02]: Shut up.

306
00:25:50,885 --> 00:25:51,145
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

307
00:25:51,305 --> 00:25:52,106
[SPEAKER_16]: You're still fat.

308
00:25:52,706 --> 00:25:53,186
[SPEAKER_02]: Shut up.

309
00:25:53,666 --> 00:25:54,027
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

310
00:25:54,627 --> 00:25:55,988
[SPEAKER_16]: Extifer, why don't you go?

311
00:25:56,048 --> 00:25:56,528
[SPEAKER_16]: How was your week?

312
00:25:56,548 --> 00:25:56,988
[SPEAKER_16]: How was your day?

313
00:25:58,229 --> 00:25:59,650
[SPEAKER_16]: My week was good.

314
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:04,193
[SPEAKER_16]: I just worked at blah, blah, boring, etc.,

315
00:26:05,612 --> 00:26:07,754
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

316
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:32,700
[SPEAKER_23]: Do you feel abandoned?

317
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,861
[SPEAKER_16]: Are you having abandonment issues?

318
00:26:33,881 --> 00:26:34,201
[SPEAKER_16]: I do.

319
00:26:34,441 --> 00:26:38,162
[SPEAKER_16]: I was planning on, you know... That precious Amanda Miklatov had to go.

320
00:26:38,242 --> 00:26:38,542
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

321
00:26:38,602 --> 00:26:43,024
[SPEAKER_16]: I was planning on hanging out with Miklatov as he was doing the show with you guys.

322
00:26:43,084 --> 00:26:49,486
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, usually when Miklatov is here on the show, he'll drop in and say hi, and then he retires out to the living room because he just doesn't really want to be on the show.

323
00:26:49,786 --> 00:26:54,087
[SPEAKER_16]: And we got a new gay channel here, logo, that I was just watching in the other room.

324
00:26:54,107 --> 00:26:54,628
[SPEAKER_16]: Super!

325
00:26:54,888 --> 00:26:55,208
[SPEAKER_16]: I know.

326
00:26:55,268 --> 00:26:56,168
[SPEAKER_16]: It's super fabulous.

327
00:26:56,788 --> 00:26:58,369
[SPEAKER_16]: And we... They were having a...

328
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,121
[SPEAKER_16]: Is that funny?

329
00:27:01,263 --> 00:27:02,665
[SPEAKER_16]: What are you laughing at over there?

330
00:27:04,487 --> 00:27:05,549
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it the chat room?

331
00:27:05,869 --> 00:27:06,029
[SPEAKER_17]: No.

332
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:08,693
[SPEAKER_17]: Just the way he's super fabulous.

333
00:27:08,713 --> 00:27:09,434
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know.

334
00:27:09,474 --> 00:27:10,075
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a big queer.

335
00:27:11,557 --> 00:27:12,759
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I'm not, dude.

336
00:27:14,332 --> 00:27:20,934
[SPEAKER_16]: We went, so I was watching that channel and they have, you know, a lot of super gay programming on it.

337
00:27:21,054 --> 00:27:21,974
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, imagine that.

338
00:27:22,194 --> 00:27:23,835
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, on the gay channel, what are you going to have?

339
00:27:23,855 --> 00:27:26,596
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to have... Well, you know, they have Wonderfalls, which isn't totally gay.

340
00:27:26,636 --> 00:27:30,917
[SPEAKER_02]: Madonna documentaries and, I don't know, what else do you show on the gay channel?

341
00:27:30,937 --> 00:27:31,637
[SPEAKER_16]: They don't have Madonna.

342
00:27:31,657 --> 00:27:35,418
[SPEAKER_16]: It was actually, it was a reality show based around this gay...

343
00:27:35,939 --> 00:27:37,239
[SPEAKER_16]: I like sitting here right now.

344
00:28:07,374 --> 00:28:08,115
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't know that?

345
00:28:08,375 --> 00:28:14,042
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura as a straight woman, do you ever look at a guy and go, I bet that guy has some nice balls!

346
00:28:16,645 --> 00:28:17,506
[SPEAKER_17]: Occasionally?

347
00:28:20,069 --> 00:28:22,152
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm more like, I hope he shames those.

348
00:28:23,171 --> 00:28:23,571
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

349
00:28:23,731 --> 00:28:24,532
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my God.

350
00:28:24,672 --> 00:28:25,093
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my God.

351
00:28:25,193 --> 00:28:25,493
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

352
00:28:25,813 --> 00:28:26,173
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wow.

353
00:28:26,234 --> 00:28:26,634
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at that.

354
00:28:26,894 --> 00:28:28,035
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes Harry is better.

355
00:28:28,155 --> 00:28:28,675
[SPEAKER_02]: Amazing.

356
00:28:28,716 --> 00:28:29,076
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at that.

357
00:28:29,096 --> 00:28:30,897
[SPEAKER_02]: We just lost half our listeners.

358
00:28:31,077 --> 00:28:31,618
[SPEAKER_02]: Good job.

359
00:28:31,718 --> 00:28:33,019
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we're down to one listener.

360
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:33,259
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

361
00:28:33,299 --> 00:28:34,340
[SPEAKER_16]: Good job.

362
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:37,082
[SPEAKER_16]: You lost half your listeners like last week.

363
00:28:37,262 --> 00:28:38,283
[SPEAKER_16]: We went from two to one.

364
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:38,824
[SPEAKER_16]: Good job.

365
00:28:39,204 --> 00:28:39,564
[SPEAKER_16]: Good job.

366
00:28:43,347 --> 00:28:43,608
Great.

367
00:28:44,468 --> 00:28:47,290
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyway, so that's how my week was and my day.

368
00:28:49,712 --> 00:28:50,293
[SPEAKER_16]: That's good to know.

369
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:50,653
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

370
00:28:51,394 --> 00:28:51,794
[SPEAKER_17]: No problem.

371
00:28:51,814 --> 00:28:52,795
[SPEAKER_17]: Your week was balls.

372
00:28:53,661 --> 00:28:54,562
[SPEAKER_16]: It was Hairy Balls.

373
00:28:55,422 --> 00:28:56,422
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, and Serenity.

374
00:28:56,543 --> 00:28:57,443
[SPEAKER_16]: Hairy Balls and Serenity.

375
00:29:00,745 --> 00:29:03,826
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, I'm so glad that this show just instantly went down the toilet.

376
00:29:03,866 --> 00:29:04,406
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.

377
00:29:04,607 --> 00:29:06,067
[SPEAKER_17]: And Legend of Zaku gets it!

378
00:29:06,467 --> 00:29:06,688
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

379
00:29:07,128 --> 00:29:07,988
[SPEAKER_02]: What did Legend of Zaku say?

380
00:29:08,869 --> 00:29:12,691
[SPEAKER_17]: The in-your-mouth line after... Didn't you see Jay and Silent Bob straight back?

381
00:29:13,391 --> 00:29:15,312
[SPEAKER_02]: I did, like, years ago.

382
00:29:16,012 --> 00:29:16,813
[SPEAKER_02]: When it first came out.

383
00:29:18,994 --> 00:29:19,094
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah...

384
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:22,111
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft

385
00:29:42,618 --> 00:29:43,619
[SPEAKER_02]: Dance Dance Revolution Xtreme

386
00:30:04,286 --> 00:30:08,509
[SPEAKER_02]: In this break we're going to hear some more music from DDR Extreme 2.

387
00:30:09,009 --> 00:30:14,813
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to hear Injection of Love, but this is the version of Injection of Love that has the vocals not in it.

388
00:30:15,113 --> 00:30:17,515
[SPEAKER_02]: So see if you like this version.

389
00:30:17,535 --> 00:30:22,058
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little bit different there because they actually stripped out Sana's vocals because...

390
00:30:22,638 --> 00:30:26,699
[SPEAKER_02]: Controversially, Sana says, fuck me, in one part of the song, where she says, fuck me.

391
00:30:27,079 --> 00:30:32,501
[SPEAKER_02]: Although, some people are saying, no, she doesn't say, fuck me, she's actually saying, suck me, or something else.

392
00:30:32,521 --> 00:30:33,541
[SPEAKER_02]: She totally says, fuck me.

393
00:30:33,561 --> 00:30:38,082
[SPEAKER_02]: She totally says, fuck me, and even if she's not trying to say, fuck me, she says, fuck me.

394
00:30:38,402 --> 00:30:41,383
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I don't know if the lyrics, in fact, let me see, hold on.

395
00:30:41,563 --> 00:30:43,143
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no problem with those words.

396
00:30:43,163 --> 00:30:44,564
[SPEAKER_02]: God damn it, y'all got me on a tangent.

397
00:30:46,884 --> 00:30:49,945
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me pull this up real fast here, because I have to prove something to you people.

398
00:30:50,583 --> 00:30:59,452
[SPEAKER_02]: So for those of you guys that have never heard Injection of Love, even though we've actually played this quite a bit on our show before this was ever in DDR Extreme USA, here's a little piece of Injection of Love.

399
00:30:59,873 --> 00:31:02,255
[SPEAKER_02]: And you tell me if this doesn't sound like fuck.

400
00:31:11,405 --> 00:31:13,327
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit after this part, let me fast forward a little bit here.

401
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:25,471
[SPEAKER_02]: She totally said fuck me right there.

402
00:31:25,651 --> 00:31:25,951
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on.

403
00:31:25,971 --> 00:31:27,612
[SPEAKER_16]: She totally said fuck me.

404
00:31:27,652 --> 00:31:28,973
[SPEAKER_16]: It's called injection of love.

405
00:31:30,274 --> 00:31:31,475
[SPEAKER_16]: Of course she said fuck me.

406
00:31:32,376 --> 00:31:34,397
[SPEAKER_16]: Isn't that giving your injection of love?

407
00:31:34,697 --> 00:31:36,719
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm gonna inject you with my meat rod.

408
00:31:37,379 --> 00:31:38,220
[SPEAKER_16]: No, my love.

409
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:39,000
[SPEAKER_16]: My love rod.

410
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,641
[SPEAKER_16]: In other words, my cock.

411
00:31:43,123 --> 00:31:46,105
[SPEAKER_16]: And in some weird porn way, my balls too.

412
00:31:48,379 --> 00:31:48,659
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

413
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:57,103
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I understand if you guys, I don't know, you probably went on some website and looked up the official lyrics or something, and maybe it's not fuck.

414
00:31:57,583 --> 00:32:01,345
[SPEAKER_02]: But let's face it, if it's not supposed to be fuck, she did a pretty bad job.

415
00:32:02,326 --> 00:32:03,867
[SPEAKER_02]: She did a Freudian slip.

416
00:32:04,107 --> 00:32:05,727
[SPEAKER_02]: She was thinking about fucking when she sang it.

417
00:32:06,168 --> 00:32:07,208
[SPEAKER_02]: And so she said, fuck me.

418
00:32:08,189 --> 00:32:08,789
[SPEAKER_02]: There, so.

419
00:32:09,889 --> 00:32:11,050
[SPEAKER_02]: What does fuck mean?

420
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:13,171
[SPEAKER_24]: Because, get it?

421
00:32:13,211 --> 00:32:14,212
[SPEAKER_24]: She doesn't say fuck right?

422
00:32:14,252 --> 00:32:15,152
[SPEAKER_24]: She says fuck.

423
00:32:15,192 --> 00:32:16,873
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, to me it sounds more like fook me.

424
00:32:17,836 --> 00:32:20,197
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Fook Me and Fook You from... forget it.

425
00:32:20,457 --> 00:32:21,257
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, I do.

426
00:32:22,397 --> 00:32:23,178
[SPEAKER_16]: It just wasn't funny.

427
00:32:23,198 --> 00:32:27,699
[SPEAKER_02]: So needless to say, they had to strip out the vocals because, you know, they weren't going to do that.

428
00:32:28,519 --> 00:32:41,703
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm assuming, anyway, that that's why they stripped out the vocals is that, you know, because it sounds like fuck in the song, although in Dance Dance Revolution Extreme, they let a little fuck slip by and the song highs off you.

429
00:32:41,723 --> 00:32:42,783
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's so hard to catch.

430
00:32:43,343 --> 00:32:46,544
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's even more controversial as to whether they're really saying...

431
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:48,583
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuckin' You Up is the lyric.

432
00:32:50,044 --> 00:32:51,144
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus, I don't know if you know this.

433
00:32:51,484 --> 00:32:58,285
[SPEAKER_17]: I used to think that in... What was that one that was in Beatmania?

434
00:32:59,386 --> 00:33:00,886
[SPEAKER_17]: God, now I can't remember what it was.

435
00:33:01,546 --> 00:33:04,507
[SPEAKER_17]: I always thought that they used to say Often Kissed by a Boy Band Fucker.

436
00:33:06,167 --> 00:33:08,527
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh.

437
00:33:08,768 --> 00:33:10,208
[SPEAKER_22]: Often kissed by a boy band fucker.

438
00:33:10,428 --> 00:33:11,748
[SPEAKER_22]: Often kissed by a boy band fucker.

439
00:33:11,788 --> 00:33:12,908
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, that song.

440
00:33:12,968 --> 00:33:13,969
[SPEAKER_17]: I forgot what the song was.

441
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:15,029
[SPEAKER_02]: Wonderland.

442
00:33:16,937 --> 00:33:17,437
[SPEAKER_17]: That was it.

443
00:33:17,618 --> 00:33:17,818
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

444
00:33:18,378 --> 00:33:21,200
[SPEAKER_02]: That was in one of the earlier USDDRs as well as like, what, third mix?

445
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:21,801
[SPEAKER_02]: Like way back when?

446
00:33:22,141 --> 00:33:22,601
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, anyway.

447
00:33:23,362 --> 00:33:29,827
[SPEAKER_02]: I swear we're going to get to the song, but I just wanted to get that out there about, you know, word censorship and all that stuff.

448
00:33:29,867 --> 00:33:31,048
[SPEAKER_02]: So, here we go.

449
00:33:32,449 --> 00:33:37,293
[SPEAKER_02]: Starting off this break, the instrumental version, or as they're calling it, the Hina mix of Injection of Love.

450
00:33:37,333 --> 00:33:41,736
[SPEAKER_02]: And after this, we're going to hear some Inside Your Heart, Make a Difference, and My My My.

451
00:33:41,756 --> 00:33:42,457
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be back after this.

452
00:35:29,065 --> 00:35:30,327
Um, so, thanks

453
00:37:18,351 --> 00:37:45,145
[SPEAKER_09]: For your dreams, for your heart For your dreams, for your heart For your dreams, for your heart When a world feels so lost in itself And you feel the life is not so easy for you and me Don't forget that you're not by yourself For together we can make this world better place Give it a chance

454
00:37:51,123 --> 00:37:52,804
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

455
00:38:21,139 --> 00:38:22,220
Thank you for watching!

456
00:40:46,405 --> 00:40:56,567
[SPEAKER_20]: We're back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

457
00:40:56,587 --> 00:41:05,369
[SPEAKER_20]: Hope you enjoyed that break of more EX2 music, including Injection of Love, Inside Your Heart, Make a Difference, and My My My.

458
00:41:14,764 --> 00:41:20,446
[SPEAKER_02]: As a reminder, tonight's show is filled with Dance Dance Revolution Extreme 2 spoilers.

459
00:41:21,046 --> 00:41:30,768
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you are afraid of hearing something that might spoil Dance Dance Revolution Extreme 2 for you, let me remind you, Dance Dance Revolution Extreme 2 is not a movie or a story.

460
00:41:30,808 --> 00:41:31,709
[SPEAKER_02]: There is nothing to spoil.

461
00:41:33,989 --> 00:41:35,610
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh no, we told you a song is in the game.

462
00:41:35,650 --> 00:41:37,010
[SPEAKER_02]: You still have to work to unlock it.

463
00:41:38,888 --> 00:41:50,334
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one of those things I kind of don't get, quote unquote, on DDR Freak right now, get, putting quotes, is that everybody in the Extreme 2 thread is, even I had to do this myself because I feared the angry mob if I didn't.

464
00:41:50,594 --> 00:42:01,699
[SPEAKER_02]: They were, you know, putting all the spoilers in hidden, like you have to highlight with your mouse type text because, you know, they don't want, you know, people are not wanting the game to be spoiled.

465
00:42:02,039 --> 00:42:05,781
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm thinking anybody with common sense would think if I don't want to spoil this game,

466
00:42:06,661 --> 00:42:13,706
[SPEAKER_02]: I probably shouldn't go on a discussion forum where people are talking about how much they've been playing it and how great the game is and all the songs they've been getting.

467
00:42:13,766 --> 00:42:17,908
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not sure I get the point of why we're being so insensitive about spoilers.

468
00:42:18,389 --> 00:42:19,569
[SPEAKER_02]: So, whatever.

469
00:42:22,131 --> 00:42:27,234
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe somebody will call up and yell at me for spoiling Dance Dance Revolution Extreme 2, but you know what?

470
00:42:28,675 --> 00:42:29,156
[SPEAKER_02]: I warned you.

471
00:42:30,236 --> 00:42:30,636
[SPEAKER_02]: We all did.

472
00:42:31,937 --> 00:42:32,658
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Loki's here.

473
00:42:32,778 --> 00:42:34,499
[SPEAKER_02]: He's back here.

474
00:42:34,912 --> 00:42:36,132
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, I'm good.

475
00:42:36,272 --> 00:42:36,632
[SPEAKER_25]: Fired!

476
00:42:36,912 --> 00:42:37,353
[SPEAKER_25]: No, I'm just kidding.

477
00:42:37,373 --> 00:42:37,913
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm not fired.

478
00:42:37,933 --> 00:42:40,473
[SPEAKER_25]: I had top secret work to be working on.

479
00:42:40,493 --> 00:42:40,653
[SPEAKER_25]: I know.

480
00:42:41,173 --> 00:42:43,434
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's going to be... And I have to get a sandwich also.

481
00:42:43,654 --> 00:42:44,394
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, that's fine.

482
00:42:45,454 --> 00:42:47,635
[SPEAKER_02]: You're allowed to be late once in a while, but don't let it happen again.

483
00:42:47,655 --> 00:42:49,855
[SPEAKER_02]: So how are you doing?

484
00:42:49,875 --> 00:42:50,255
[SPEAKER_02]: How was your week?

485
00:42:50,275 --> 00:42:50,615
[SPEAKER_02]: How was your day?

486
00:42:51,375 --> 00:42:52,276
[SPEAKER_25]: My week was okay.

487
00:42:52,576 --> 00:43:02,738
[SPEAKER_25]: Today was kind of weird because Nelly decided, you know, instead of watching the Food Network today, she wanted to watch TLC, which they were playing...

488
00:43:04,179 --> 00:43:08,120
[SPEAKER_25]: It's like a whole lineup of medical procedures that could go wrong.

489
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:11,501
[SPEAKER_25]: Like, for example, they had plastic surgery gone wrong.

490
00:43:11,861 --> 00:43:16,842
[SPEAKER_25]: Then they had another one that was when medical instruments get left behind.

491
00:43:16,942 --> 00:43:20,303
[SPEAKER_25]: You know, a whole series of people... Oh, look, we left a sponge in you.

492
00:43:20,463 --> 00:43:23,044
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, look, there's scissors in you.

493
00:43:23,264 --> 00:43:25,184
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sorry, but we've replaced your heart with a baked potato.

494
00:43:25,304 --> 00:43:26,905
[SPEAKER_17]: You have five seconds to live.

495
00:43:26,945 --> 00:43:27,285
[SPEAKER_25]: Exactly.

496
00:43:27,365 --> 00:43:27,905
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, sure.

497
00:43:28,145 --> 00:43:31,006
[SPEAKER_25]: It was just like, you know, I didn't need to be watching that stuff, so...

498
00:43:32,789 --> 00:43:34,690
[SPEAKER_25]: But other than that, no, really not too much going on.

499
00:43:35,090 --> 00:43:38,432
[SPEAKER_25]: Except, I don't know, I'm just getting some more games to sell back.

500
00:43:38,972 --> 00:43:39,252
[SPEAKER_24]: Right on.

501
00:43:39,732 --> 00:43:42,594
[SPEAKER_25]: So, I'm clearing out, you know, my excess crap.

502
00:43:43,074 --> 00:43:44,995
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, cool.

503
00:43:45,215 --> 00:43:46,275
[SPEAKER_02]: What else was I going to ask you about?

504
00:43:47,256 --> 00:43:50,137
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, actually, I wanted to tell the listeners about this before the break.

505
00:43:51,257 --> 00:43:53,078
[SPEAKER_02]: You missed a little bit of show, obviously, Loki.

506
00:43:53,518 --> 00:43:56,520
[SPEAKER_02]: Luckily, you missed the conversation on balls, because extra for...

507
00:43:57,250 --> 00:43:58,131
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

508
00:44:25,802 --> 00:44:27,723
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I don't take note of everybody's gender sometimes.

509
00:44:27,943 --> 00:44:36,745
[SPEAKER_02]: This person actually sent me a picture of the 2DX Red booklet that actually shows the lyrics here to Injection of Love.

510
00:44:36,785 --> 00:44:44,548
[SPEAKER_02]: And sure enough, something something in Japanese, touch me, something something lick me, something something stroke me.

511
00:44:45,368 --> 00:44:47,869
[SPEAKER_02]: She's supposed to be saying stroke me.

512
00:44:48,429 --> 00:44:51,190
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so keeping that in mind, here we go again.

513
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:54,491
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to play you the vocal version of Injection of Love, that little piece here.

514
00:44:54,891 --> 00:44:55,531
[SPEAKER_02]: You tell me

515
00:44:56,115 --> 00:44:57,656
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck or stroke?

516
00:44:58,056 --> 00:44:58,817
[SPEAKER_02]: You be the judge.

517
00:45:11,867 --> 00:45:17,010
[SPEAKER_25]: That's clearly an F. That is clearly an F. That is not stroke me.

518
00:45:17,050 --> 00:45:19,032
[SPEAKER_25]: Fuck me does not sound like stroke me.

519
00:45:19,292 --> 00:45:22,314
[SPEAKER_25]: Unless she has some weird fucking accent, that's all I gotta say.

520
00:45:22,374 --> 00:45:24,436
[SPEAKER_25]: If she pronounces her S's like F's.

521
00:45:25,117 --> 00:45:27,018
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, we're going to go club some baby feels?

522
00:45:27,798 --> 00:45:30,279
[SPEAKER_02]: Or we're going to... I don't... Yeah, it doesn't work.

523
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:30,979
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

524
00:45:31,059 --> 00:45:32,299
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care what the lyric book says.

525
00:45:32,599 --> 00:45:33,419
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for sharing.

526
00:45:33,499 --> 00:45:35,080
[SPEAKER_02]: The restaurant is down the feet.

527
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:38,941
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

528
00:45:40,722 --> 00:45:42,682
[SPEAKER_02]: I do appreciate you sharing the lyric book, though.

529
00:45:42,722 --> 00:45:44,743
[SPEAKER_02]: At least I know... Maybe she was drunk.

530
00:45:44,883 --> 00:45:46,323
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Sana.

531
00:45:46,363 --> 00:45:46,723
[SPEAKER_02]: Sana.

532
00:45:47,023 --> 00:45:51,445
[SPEAKER_17]: Because I remember when I was drunk at Dave & Buster's and I called my food a chili feet steak.

533
00:45:55,836 --> 00:45:56,116
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

534
00:45:56,576 --> 00:45:57,637
[SPEAKER_17]: It was a Philly cheesesteak.

535
00:45:58,937 --> 00:46:03,679
[SPEAKER_02]: MPQ in chatroom says, Akira Yamaoka said stroke, but Sana said fuck.

536
00:46:03,799 --> 00:46:04,700
[SPEAKER_02]: Discussion over.

537
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:06,040
[SPEAKER_02]: I can agree with that.

538
00:46:06,741 --> 00:46:08,582
[SPEAKER_02]: Sana butchered the lyrics to Injection of Love.

539
00:46:08,962 --> 00:46:10,502
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes for a good Bimani drama story.

540
00:46:11,503 --> 00:46:13,204
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, of course, naturally, that's followed up.

541
00:46:13,244 --> 00:46:16,925
[SPEAKER_02]: Leave this to our chatroom with Sakurina saying, Akira Yamaoka must have big balls.

542
00:46:21,987 --> 00:46:22,928
[SPEAKER_24]: You guys are so immature.

543
00:46:23,328 --> 00:46:23,608
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

544
00:46:24,068 --> 00:46:24,388
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

545
00:46:25,049 --> 00:46:25,449
[SPEAKER_02]: Balls!

546
00:46:26,246 --> 00:46:26,506
[SPEAKER_02]: Shut up.

547
00:46:27,067 --> 00:46:28,507
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you're talking about the drink, right?

548
00:46:29,228 --> 00:46:29,528
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

549
00:46:29,688 --> 00:46:30,108
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

550
00:46:31,189 --> 00:46:31,549
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyways.

551
00:46:31,569 --> 00:46:31,989
[SPEAKER_02]: Balls.

552
00:46:32,129 --> 00:46:32,330
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

553
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:35,231
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to talk about, um, I want to talk about Pump It Up.

554
00:46:35,612 --> 00:46:36,652
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to talk about one more thing, too.

555
00:46:36,852 --> 00:46:37,012
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

556
00:46:37,152 --> 00:46:38,153
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to talk about Pump It Up first.

557
00:46:38,213 --> 00:46:39,134
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, what do you want to talk about?

558
00:46:39,534 --> 00:46:39,754
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

559
00:46:40,074 --> 00:46:44,177
[SPEAKER_25]: So, this is the first time I got, well, yesterday I got a sandwich at Rayleigh's.

560
00:46:44,617 --> 00:46:45,017
[SPEAKER_25]: That was okay.

561
00:46:46,058 --> 00:46:47,639
[SPEAKER_25]: Today I got a sandwich in there.

562
00:46:47,659 --> 00:46:48,599
[SPEAKER_25]: What kind of turkey would you want?

563
00:46:48,819 --> 00:46:51,321
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm like, I thought there was only one kind of turkey, you know?

564
00:46:51,821 --> 00:46:52,401
[SPEAKER_25]: The bird turkey.

565
00:46:52,922 --> 00:46:53,262
[SPEAKER_25]: But, um.

566
00:46:54,352 --> 00:46:57,354
[SPEAKER_25]: So I am all, I just want that one, because it looked like the turkey I normally get.

567
00:46:57,434 --> 00:46:58,675
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, this is salsa turkey.

568
00:46:59,896 --> 00:47:03,458
[SPEAKER_25]: Now, I don't know what the difference is, but it sort of tastes like it was dipped in salsa.

569
00:47:03,518 --> 00:47:04,359
[SPEAKER_25]: It's a Mexican turkey?

570
00:47:04,939 --> 00:47:05,440
[SPEAKER_25]: I guess.

571
00:47:05,540 --> 00:47:07,041
[SPEAKER_25]: I didn't know there were Mexican turkeys.

572
00:47:07,061 --> 00:47:10,123
[SPEAKER_25]: Is there a Lombada turkey and a... More importantly, is it tasty?

573
00:47:10,183 --> 00:47:10,723
[SPEAKER_17]: Foxtrot?

574
00:47:10,983 --> 00:47:12,344
[SPEAKER_25]: It tastes like salsa, partially.

575
00:47:13,525 --> 00:47:14,045
[SPEAKER_17]: Imagine that.

576
00:47:14,065 --> 00:47:15,546
[SPEAKER_17]: That doesn't sound yummy.

577
00:47:15,987 --> 00:47:16,487
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, go ahead.

578
00:47:17,293 --> 00:47:18,374
[SPEAKER_02]: Pump It Up Step Chart Editor

579
00:47:39,561 --> 00:47:56,935
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something that you download on Xbox Live, and when I say download, it's actually very similar to the way the characters in Ultramix 2 were unlocked, where you're basically downloading a code or something that unlocks it inside the game, because it's only a five block file, and I have a hard time believing that a step editor would fit in five blocks of data.

580
00:47:57,436 --> 00:48:02,380
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you download this thing, and then you suddenly have a step editor available to you in Pump It Up.

581
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:03,561
[SPEAKER_02]: No big deal, right?

582
00:48:03,601 --> 00:48:05,201
[SPEAKER_02]: It just puts it up there on the level with DDR.

583
00:48:05,242 --> 00:48:06,962
[SPEAKER_02]: You can create your own steps to songs.

584
00:48:07,363 --> 00:48:14,527
[SPEAKER_02]: And in fact, the editor in Pump It Up is a hell of a lot like the DDR editor, but, you know, with pump arrows.

585
00:48:15,647 --> 00:48:20,730
[SPEAKER_02]: But here's the really interesting thing that I think might have slipped through the cracks and some people didn't notice.

586
00:48:21,170 --> 00:48:29,695
[SPEAKER_02]: Not only can you edit the steps to songs in Pump It Up, but you can create brand new step files to songs loaded on your Xbox hard drive.

587
00:48:30,474 --> 00:48:35,952
[SPEAKER_02]: custom soundtrack feature to create your own arrows to songs that you rip to your hard drive.

588
00:48:36,730 --> 00:48:46,818
[SPEAKER_02]: So finally, we have this game out there that allows you to create steps to your own music, which is something people have been wanting in DDR for a long time.

589
00:48:47,318 --> 00:48:49,800
[SPEAKER_02]: Although, licensing issues, of course, make that a nightmare.

590
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:54,663
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, obviously, you can't really take these files and send them over the internet to other people.

591
00:48:55,044 --> 00:48:58,446
[SPEAKER_02]: I imagine there must be a way to do it using an Xbox memory card, maybe?

592
00:48:58,767 --> 00:49:00,268
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know enough about Xbox...

593
00:49:00,999 --> 00:49:12,126
[SPEAKER_02]: Memory to know if you can transfer, maybe one of our listeners knows, to know if you can transfer a soundtrack, quote unquote, something you rip on the CD, to take something that you rip on the soundtrack to a memory card.

594
00:49:12,827 --> 00:49:17,870
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, you could take the step file and put it on your memory card, but I don't know if you could take soundtracks and put it on the memory card.

595
00:49:18,570 --> 00:49:25,315
[SPEAKER_02]: So, hypothetically, if you could do that, put the soundtrack on the memory card and your step file on the memory card, you could essentially...

596
00:49:26,187 --> 00:49:28,188
[SPEAKER_02]: Give these to your friends via the memory card.

597
00:49:28,448 --> 00:49:32,509
[SPEAKER_02]: And here's the other cool thing about Pump It Up, putting your own songs, your own step files.

598
00:49:33,669 --> 00:49:39,451
[SPEAKER_02]: It has this preloaded background movie, so your song even has its own background movie, which is kind of cool.

599
00:49:39,751 --> 00:49:44,372
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just a generic thing with one of those rotating cubes and lights.

600
00:49:44,492 --> 00:49:46,333
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it with the boobies?

601
00:49:46,833 --> 00:49:48,453
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not the booby law, unfortunately.

602
00:49:48,493 --> 00:49:49,214
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not the booby law.

603
00:49:50,494 --> 00:49:50,714
[SPEAKER_22]: But...

604
00:49:52,782 --> 00:49:54,883
[SPEAKER_02]: Somehow a lot of people didn't notice this.

605
00:49:55,164 --> 00:50:06,350
[SPEAKER_02]: It was actually announced on the official Pump It Up website that this actually came out on the 29th and Miklatov and I were just randomly surfing the internet this morning and he was like, wait a minute, did you realize that they put this out there?

606
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:10,512
[SPEAKER_02]: So we hooked up Xbox Live and sure enough, we just went on and downloaded it.

607
00:50:10,812 --> 00:50:15,275
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you own Pump It Up Exceed for Xbox, I don't think this exists in the PS2 version.

608
00:50:15,315 --> 00:50:17,196
[SPEAKER_02]: This only exists in the Xbox version as far as I know.

609
00:50:17,996 --> 00:50:18,436
[SPEAKER_02]: Check it out.

610
00:50:18,456 --> 00:50:21,398
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, obviously it wouldn't matter because PS2 doesn't allow you to have custom soundtracks

611
00:50:22,078 --> 00:50:22,539
[SPEAKER_02]: Check it out.

612
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:25,101
[SPEAKER_02]: Rip your own music to the Xbox hard drive.

613
00:50:25,141 --> 00:50:26,923
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very easy to do within the Xbox.

614
00:50:27,603 --> 00:50:35,350
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, what I did, I burned a CD from iTunes and just ripped it on my Xbox.

615
00:50:35,610 --> 00:50:36,831
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have like a mix of music.

616
00:50:37,092 --> 00:50:40,354
[SPEAKER_02]: But I understand that not all Xboxes will read burned CDs.

617
00:50:40,374 --> 00:50:43,297
[SPEAKER_02]: Because from what Mikulatov was telling me, his Xbox won't read burned CDs.

618
00:50:43,317 --> 00:50:43,837
[SPEAKER_17]: Ours won't either.

619
00:50:44,258 --> 00:50:44,778
[SPEAKER_02]: That's weird.

620
00:50:44,838 --> 00:50:45,259
[SPEAKER_02]: Mine will.

621
00:50:45,319 --> 00:50:47,861
[SPEAKER_17]: It also depends on the quality of the CD that you use.

622
00:50:48,041 --> 00:50:48,321
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.

623
00:50:49,549 --> 00:50:58,491
[SPEAKER_02]: He's theorizing this because I have the Halo Xbox that maybe somehow the drive in mine is different and it allows it to read the burned disc.

624
00:50:58,591 --> 00:50:58,951
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

625
00:50:59,291 --> 00:51:00,531
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's one thing.

626
00:51:00,851 --> 00:51:07,612
[SPEAKER_02]: So before you try that, realize that your Xbox may not read the burned thing and rip it to the custom soundtrack.

627
00:51:07,672 --> 00:51:14,673
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm hoping you still have some legitimate CDs in your collection out there, boys and girls, so you can certainly rip those.

628
00:51:15,134 --> 00:51:15,294
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

629
00:51:18,647 --> 00:51:20,048
[SPEAKER_02]: Very, very interesting.

630
00:51:22,470 --> 00:51:28,654
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think a lot of people didn't really realize that because I don't think a lot of people are following what's going on in the Pump It Up scene.

631
00:51:29,094 --> 00:51:31,416
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's what we're here at Orange Lounge Radio to do.

632
00:51:31,536 --> 00:51:32,577
[SPEAKER_02]: So have fun with that.

633
00:51:32,797 --> 00:51:35,699
[SPEAKER_02]: Go dig up your copy of Pump It Up and have fun making your own steps there.

634
00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:37,420
[SPEAKER_02]: Should be interesting.

635
00:51:41,443 --> 00:51:48,108
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, somebody in the chat room is actually telling me, Ron Chan is actually saying that there are three different types of Xbox Drives.

636
00:51:49,304 --> 00:51:53,507
[SPEAKER_02]: So, possibly, I have one of the ones that will let you read the burned CDs.

637
00:51:53,527 --> 00:51:55,008
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, the old Xboxes don't do that.

638
00:51:55,308 --> 00:51:55,629
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

639
00:51:57,150 --> 00:51:57,370
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

640
00:51:58,491 --> 00:52:09,498
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, of course, a lot of our chatroom is using this opportunity to say, Andamiro wins, Andamiro effed Konami in the A, Andamiro loves us long time, Andamiro, yay, yay, yay.

641
00:52:10,219 --> 00:52:16,183
[SPEAKER_02]: And, of course, I realize this is a feature people have been wanting for forever, but did Andamiro serve Konami?

642
00:52:16,503 --> 00:52:18,685
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this going to revolutionize things?

643
00:52:19,813 --> 00:52:21,074
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

644
00:52:31,601 --> 00:52:33,022
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

645
00:52:57,412 --> 00:52:58,013
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

646
00:53:18,235 --> 00:53:22,378
[SPEAKER_02]: But the problem is you have to set the delay as well, and that was a real bitch for us to figure out the delay.

647
00:53:22,678 --> 00:53:31,424
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there was no easy way for us to, like, there was no press the X button when the song starts type thing, so we had to actually calculate in time the delay.

648
00:53:31,804 --> 00:53:34,686
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was kind of a bitch to do, but once we got it, it was pretty cool.

649
00:53:35,566 --> 00:53:41,490
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't know how many people were going to take the time to do that, just to play their own song.

650
00:53:41,550 --> 00:53:43,912
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, maybe I'm underestimating what people want to do out there.

651
00:53:43,932 --> 00:53:47,314
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a whole SimFile community that has to do it the same way, so...

652
00:53:48,348 --> 00:53:51,949
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but the thing about the sim file community is that you can zip those up, send them on the internet very easily.

653
00:53:52,289 --> 00:54:10,792
[SPEAKER_02]: Stepmania practically endorses that, I mean, they don't endorse it, I guess, but they thrive on that type of distribution, basically, is that, you know, you even have, what, the SM zip file, you know, an archive file that's specifically made for Stepmania, which is the way, what, like, FoodMix and stuff was distributed, right?

654
00:54:10,952 --> 00:54:13,773
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, it's just a zip file with some other program that runs it.

655
00:54:13,873 --> 00:54:15,153
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, so...

656
00:54:16,243 --> 00:54:21,467
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, it is the same as making a sim file, but at the same time, a sim file is very easy to get out there and share.

657
00:54:21,807 --> 00:54:27,251
[SPEAKER_02]: And let's face it, I think that's what motivates people, is because people want to share what they've done.

658
00:54:29,512 --> 00:54:40,980
[SPEAKER_02]: I think one way that this could be improved upon is for Andomero to set up a database very similar to what Ultramix 2 had, where users can submit their own step files,

659
00:54:41,798 --> 00:54:42,919
[SPEAKER_02]: and then share it with each other.

660
00:54:42,959 --> 00:54:46,441
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, the problem is, of course, you wouldn't be able to share the music because that's all type of copyright laws.

661
00:54:46,881 --> 00:54:58,548
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, if you had maybe like, you know, you say, this is track one on the latest garbage album or something, you know, and then assumably if everybody ripped the same track, it would all be the same, right?

662
00:54:59,629 --> 00:54:59,989
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

663
00:55:00,750 --> 00:55:02,190
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you kind of understand what I'm saying?

664
00:55:02,571 --> 00:55:02,891
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

665
00:55:03,071 --> 00:55:07,494
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe not so feasible, but it's a way to do it legally where you could distribute the sim files.

666
00:55:08,034 --> 00:55:09,755
[SPEAKER_02]: So, go figure.

667
00:55:13,661 --> 00:55:16,585
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think I'll be really using this feature for anything else.

668
00:55:16,625 --> 00:55:17,246
[SPEAKER_02]: I tried it once.

669
00:55:17,306 --> 00:55:22,733
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cute, but I don't really want to make my own step files to dance to because I'll be able to beat it too easy if I made it.

670
00:55:23,614 --> 00:55:24,875
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't have Pump It Up.

671
00:55:25,697 --> 00:55:26,197
[SPEAKER_02]: You should get it.

672
00:55:26,257 --> 00:55:27,519
[SPEAKER_02]: It's surprisingly good.

673
00:55:29,106 --> 00:55:31,227
[SPEAKER_17]: I got a free game, though, while Dan was in Texas.

674
00:55:31,307 --> 00:55:31,727
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, what's that?

675
00:55:32,247 --> 00:55:33,948
[SPEAKER_17]: I have Taiko Drum Master.

676
00:55:34,388 --> 00:55:35,268
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, Taiko Drum Master.

677
00:55:35,288 --> 00:55:35,649
[SPEAKER_24]: How's that?

678
00:55:36,569 --> 00:55:43,772
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I haven't opened mine yet, but I've played other people's, and I kind of want the Japanese one, just because of the other songs in it.

679
00:55:44,212 --> 00:55:52,035
[SPEAKER_17]: But he picked up the Red Octane drum thing, so I'm going to do a comparison of them so that I can talk about it on the show.

680
00:55:52,435 --> 00:55:52,695
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, very good.

681
00:55:52,715 --> 00:55:58,097
[SPEAKER_17]: Because I've been hearing from a lot of people that the red octane one is highly inferior to, of course, the official stuff.

682
00:55:58,837 --> 00:56:03,938
[SPEAKER_02]: But then again, that happens with most of the... Right, well, I mean, when they're trying to sell it cheaper, they're going to use cheaper parts.

683
00:56:04,399 --> 00:56:05,959
[SPEAKER_17]: I look at it, it's a cheap knockoff.

684
00:56:06,199 --> 00:56:07,720
[SPEAKER_17]: All their products are cheap knockoffs.

685
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:10,080
[SPEAKER_25]: At least it wasn't as bad as the Rave Discman.

686
00:56:11,161 --> 00:56:12,181
[SPEAKER_17]: The what?

687
00:56:12,361 --> 00:56:14,902
[SPEAKER_25]: The two triangles that were the 2DX controls.

688
00:56:14,922 --> 00:56:16,322
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, that.

689
00:56:20,163 --> 00:56:20,784
[SPEAKER_02]: Very interesting.

690
00:56:21,364 --> 00:56:22,104
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, um...

691
00:56:25,106 --> 00:56:29,089
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, we're going to... I think we're going to open up the Skype line pretty soon here.

692
00:56:29,109 --> 00:56:31,811
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to go to another break just yet, so I guess we'll go into the next topic.

693
00:56:31,871 --> 00:56:35,494
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about what's been going on, of course, with DDR Extreme 2.

694
00:56:35,554 --> 00:56:37,976
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, Loki, have you gotten to play Extreme 2 at all?

695
00:56:38,156 --> 00:56:38,696
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I have.

696
00:56:38,897 --> 00:56:45,622
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't really talked about our thoughts on the game yet, so I'm kind of curious, because I want the listeners to be able to give their feedback when we come back from the next break on the Skype line.

697
00:56:45,942 --> 00:56:47,964
[SPEAKER_02]: So we should share what we think of Extreme 2.

698
00:56:48,044 --> 00:56:49,024
[SPEAKER_02]: So, what do you think?

699
00:56:49,345 --> 00:56:49,945
[SPEAKER_02]: How is Extreme 2?

700
00:56:50,486 --> 00:56:50,886
[SPEAKER_25]: I like it.

701
00:56:51,246 --> 00:56:53,188
[SPEAKER_25]: I just got to play it for like one night, though.

702
00:56:53,208 --> 00:56:54,929
[SPEAKER_25]: I haven't really gotten to play too much of it, but

703
00:56:55,339 --> 00:56:57,840
[SPEAKER_25]: Unlocked, like, quite a few things.

704
00:56:58,040 --> 00:56:59,521
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, in the Dance Master mode?

705
00:56:59,741 --> 00:57:01,182
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, that's pretty cool.

706
00:57:01,402 --> 00:57:02,363
[SPEAKER_25]: I like the way they're doing that.

707
00:57:03,083 --> 00:57:08,926
[SPEAKER_25]: The hidden steps that are in there, that's kind of a throwback to the old Guitar Freaks, you know, first mix.

708
00:57:09,546 --> 00:57:14,129
[SPEAKER_25]: I wish they'd do that with the rest of the songs, like, instead of just one step, have a bunch of them in there.

709
00:57:14,589 --> 00:57:15,249
[SPEAKER_25]: That'd be kind of neat.

710
00:57:17,330 --> 00:57:22,713
[SPEAKER_25]: And then, just some of the, well, the characters I couldn't give a crap about.

711
00:57:23,191 --> 00:57:26,915
[SPEAKER_25]: I think the fact that you have to buy their other outfits for like $100,000 is retarded.

712
00:57:27,095 --> 00:57:32,400
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, I'm like, hmm, should I buy one outfit or 20 songs?

713
00:57:33,221 --> 00:57:34,042
[SPEAKER_25]: That's a tough one there.

714
00:57:34,642 --> 00:57:38,526
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the outfits are something I think you save up for and get later on with the points.

715
00:57:38,926 --> 00:57:41,789
[SPEAKER_25]: But I do like the whole shop thing and the way you unlock songs that way.

716
00:57:42,029 --> 00:57:42,710
[SPEAKER_25]: So that way it's like,

717
00:57:43,220 --> 00:57:46,221
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, I don't want to unlock that song, so I'm going to save my points and unlock another one.

718
00:57:46,321 --> 00:57:46,821
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

719
00:57:46,881 --> 00:57:55,083
[SPEAKER_02]: I was pretty much passing up a lot of the stuff that I've had played to death before in other DDR versions, like Air.

720
00:57:55,203 --> 00:57:56,163
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't bother to buy Air.

721
00:57:56,323 --> 00:58:01,304
[SPEAKER_02]: I already have that in Extreme Japan, so I saved up the money and bought Inside Your Heart instead.

722
00:58:01,484 --> 00:58:03,985
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of interesting that I could choose to unlock things.

723
00:58:04,005 --> 00:58:07,546
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, about Inside Your Heart and some of those other ones.

724
00:58:08,406 --> 00:58:09,286
[SPEAKER_25]: Politary can't sing.

725
00:58:09,847 --> 00:58:10,967
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not Politary in that song.

726
00:58:10,987 --> 00:58:11,287
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

727
00:58:11,307 --> 00:58:11,507
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay.

728
00:58:12,153 --> 00:58:13,794
[SPEAKER_25]: I know that, but Politary Can't.

729
00:58:14,274 --> 00:58:15,936
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is true.

730
00:58:16,836 --> 00:58:18,297
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm talking about the new songs that she did.

731
00:58:18,317 --> 00:58:18,877
[SPEAKER_25]: Passion and Love?

732
00:58:19,158 --> 00:58:19,938
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, Passion and Love.

733
00:58:20,398 --> 00:58:21,139
[SPEAKER_25]: That was crap.

734
00:58:21,519 --> 00:58:27,783
[SPEAKER_25]: I was like, oh wow, everything that happened with Orbit Tribe just went down the tubes, just went back to sucking it up.

735
00:58:29,124 --> 00:58:36,769
[SPEAKER_17]: I just was amazed at how much she really sucked on the Longan Midnight Action.

736
00:58:36,789 --> 00:58:37,810
[SPEAKER_24]: I think she's alright on there.

737
00:58:37,970 --> 00:58:39,751
[SPEAKER_24]: I think she's actually pretty good on there.

738
00:58:39,771 --> 00:58:40,752
[SPEAKER_17]: A woman can't hold a key!

739
00:58:41,815 --> 00:58:44,156
[SPEAKER_17]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

740
00:59:01,056 --> 00:59:01,516
[SPEAKER_02]: Xtreme 2 Xtreme 2

741
00:59:30,128 --> 00:59:38,173
[SPEAKER_02]: FYI guys, Sakura and Daikinkai were in the E3 demo of Ultramix 3 and from what I recall, I would have noticed if they changed those banners.

742
00:59:38,493 --> 00:59:40,214
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't change those banners in Ultramix 3.

743
00:59:40,834 --> 00:59:49,479
[SPEAKER_02]: So unless something changed between E3 and when this game comes out, whatever that poster said is going to be absolutely right where Extreme 2 had their backgrounds changed.

744
00:59:49,927 --> 00:59:51,147
[SPEAKER_02]: and Extreme 3.

745
00:59:52,968 --> 00:59:56,868
[SPEAKER_02]: Extreme 2 had their backgrounds changed and Ultimate 3 did not.

746
00:59:56,888 --> 00:59:59,329
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, but the artwork for the backgrounds is going to be the last thing.

747
00:59:59,349 --> 01:00:02,810
[SPEAKER_25]: They're of course going to use whatever they have at the moment for the backgrounds.

748
01:00:03,490 --> 01:00:04,570
[SPEAKER_25]: So who gives a crap?

749
01:00:04,830 --> 01:00:06,870
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, we're talking like a few pixels here.

750
01:00:06,910 --> 01:00:08,031
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, who cares?

751
01:00:08,611 --> 01:00:08,971
[SPEAKER_25]: So what?

752
01:00:09,031 --> 01:00:09,791
[SPEAKER_25]: It's translated.

753
01:00:09,851 --> 01:00:10,251
[SPEAKER_25]: Big deal.

754
01:00:10,291 --> 01:00:11,511
[SPEAKER_25]: It's an American game now.

755
01:00:11,631 --> 01:00:15,372
[SPEAKER_02]: But she has Sakura tattooed on her face, which makes no sense now.

756
01:00:16,548 --> 01:00:16,768
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

757
01:00:16,808 --> 01:00:18,670
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, it's probably not a tattoo.

758
01:00:18,710 --> 01:00:20,911
[SPEAKER_25]: It's probably just the fucking name of the song.

759
01:00:20,931 --> 01:00:23,173
[SPEAKER_17]: If they were going to translate it, they just would have put Cherry.

760
01:00:25,574 --> 01:00:26,155
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that's true.

761
01:00:26,195 --> 01:00:26,935
[SPEAKER_02]: They could have done worse.

762
01:00:27,275 --> 01:00:29,997
[SPEAKER_02]: They could have just given us the English names of the songs.

763
01:00:30,818 --> 01:00:31,338
[SPEAKER_02]: Could have been worse.

764
01:00:32,079 --> 01:00:36,101
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what is interesting about, speaking of Sakura, I actually haven't gotten to the song yet.

765
01:00:36,121 --> 01:00:38,983
[SPEAKER_02]: I've only been reading fan feedback on DDR Freak.

766
01:00:39,423 --> 01:00:44,527
[SPEAKER_02]: But you notice that the background videos are all totally different and extreme, too.

767
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:48,762
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no... It looks like they don't use the looping thing anymore.

768
01:00:48,802 --> 01:00:54,645
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know how it would go, like, video A for a little bit, and then video B. Go to the spinning Beethovens.

769
01:00:54,745 --> 01:00:56,586
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, now go to the little plasma-looking thing.

770
01:00:56,626 --> 01:00:57,887
[SPEAKER_25]: They're all their own videos now.

771
01:00:57,907 --> 01:01:00,568
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they're all, like, all full videos now.

772
01:01:00,588 --> 01:01:05,031
[SPEAKER_25]: Some of them are featuring the looping video stuff, but a lot of them feature the backgrounds as well.

773
01:01:05,071 --> 01:01:11,214
[SPEAKER_25]: Like, I noticed in Happy Wedding and in Irresistible Monk, they were different.

774
01:01:11,787 --> 01:01:14,329
[SPEAKER_02]: And what was the other one that really used a lot of their background?

775
01:01:14,349 --> 01:01:17,192
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, like La Copa De Vida has a lot of soccer themes running through it.

776
01:01:17,632 --> 01:01:20,014
[SPEAKER_02]: And the one against all odds is kind of cool.

777
01:01:20,034 --> 01:01:26,320
[SPEAKER_02]: It just has like a very 70s looking art piece with a woman and hair blowing around and stuff.

778
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:27,821
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of neat.

779
01:01:28,141 --> 01:01:29,642
[SPEAKER_02]: I like how they did that with all the different steps.

780
01:01:29,662 --> 01:01:30,683
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a step in the right direction.

781
01:01:30,743 --> 01:01:31,264
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's cool.

782
01:01:31,384 --> 01:01:31,724
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cool.

783
01:01:32,124 --> 01:01:37,429
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very interesting that only one song in the whole game has, well, at least that I've gotten to so far, but I haven't heard of any others.

784
01:01:38,167 --> 01:01:48,251
[SPEAKER_02]: One song in the whole game has an actual music video, and that's Get Busy, which is probably one of the most, well, one of my least favorite songs to play in DDR.

785
01:01:48,291 --> 01:01:48,931
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's put it that way.

786
01:01:49,371 --> 01:01:50,351
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a big Get Busy fan.

787
01:01:51,132 --> 01:01:51,992
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what song that is, right?

788
01:01:52,012 --> 01:01:52,652
[SPEAKER_02]: The reggae one?

789
01:01:52,732 --> 01:01:52,932
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

790
01:01:53,612 --> 01:01:54,713
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a big fan of Get Busy.

791
01:01:56,814 --> 01:01:57,134
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.

792
01:01:58,254 --> 01:01:59,074
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting point, though.

793
01:01:59,975 --> 01:02:02,375
[SPEAKER_02]: Reading in our chat room over at OrangeLaunchRadio.com, click on chat.

794
01:02:02,976 --> 01:02:04,516
[SPEAKER_02]: Sakurina says, why did they do that, though?

795
01:02:04,536 --> 01:02:06,697
[SPEAKER_02]: Because Kakumei was left as is.

796
01:02:07,972 --> 01:02:09,593
[SPEAKER_02]: So why did they change this, but not that?

797
01:02:09,973 --> 01:02:10,793
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know.

798
01:02:11,294 --> 01:02:11,794
[SPEAKER_25]: Interesting thought.

799
01:02:11,814 --> 01:02:12,194
[SPEAKER_25]: Who cares?

800
01:02:13,295 --> 01:02:13,815
[SPEAKER_25]: Who cares?

801
01:02:13,835 --> 01:02:15,896
[SPEAKER_25]: Why are you guys putting this much thought into it?

802
01:02:16,296 --> 01:02:16,937
[SPEAKER_25]: Who cares?

803
01:02:20,438 --> 01:02:23,340
[SPEAKER_25]: My thoughts on the extreme... It's not tattooed on her fucking face!

804
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:27,922
[SPEAKER_25]: It's just the logo that happens to be on her face.

805
01:02:28,322 --> 01:02:32,525
[SPEAKER_25]: Doesn't mean it's tattooed on her face, because who the hell would tattoo a word on their face?

806
01:02:32,545 --> 01:02:33,185
[SPEAKER_25]: That's retarded.

807
01:02:34,785 --> 01:02:37,326
[SPEAKER_17]: I honestly think that they should have left it as Kanji.

808
01:02:37,986 --> 01:02:49,130
[SPEAKER_17]: Because with any sort of sense of logic would assume that if you're playing a song with a Japanese title and you see Kanji, that typically it's probably going to be the same thing.

809
01:02:49,870 --> 01:02:50,770
[SPEAKER_17]: So, duh!

810
01:02:51,871 --> 01:02:55,312
[SPEAKER_17]: There has to be somebody pretty stupid in their localization department at Konami.

811
01:02:56,749 --> 01:02:57,930
[SPEAKER_02]: Snare has a comment there.

812
01:02:58,491 --> 01:03:01,593
[SPEAKER_02]: Palavstian... I can never pronounce this damn name.

813
01:03:02,014 --> 01:03:05,457
[SPEAKER_02]: Palavstian Dances and Chorus has its own full music video too.

814
01:03:06,458 --> 01:03:14,025
[SPEAKER_02]: I say that's kind of borderline because that's a Konami original and all the video is clips from the game that that song is featured in, which is Oz.

815
01:03:14,645 --> 01:03:15,346
[SPEAKER_02]: And Oz...

816
01:03:15,546 --> 01:03:16,126
[SPEAKER_02]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

817
01:03:42,404 --> 01:03:50,491
[SPEAKER_02]: My thoughts on Xtreme 2, geez, it's very interesting that this is the first mix that they've released that isn't an arcade port, basically.

818
01:03:51,351 --> 01:04:07,484
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, even when you look at Xtreme, the last one they released here in the US, Xtreme, even though they radically changed the interface and everything, I think for a lot of people it was still our version of the port of the Xtreme arcade mix, right?

819
01:04:07,905 --> 01:04:11,848
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is really the first game where there's been no arcade mix to base it off of.

820
01:04:12,711 --> 01:04:26,177
[SPEAKER_02]: So you really, I think, see that evolution from a game that is a translation of an arcade game for the home mixes to a game that is specifically made to be played on a home mix.

821
01:04:27,034 --> 01:04:52,063
[SPEAKER_02]: and I think that's why it centers so strongly around Dance Master Mode because that's a very single player, adventure, conquest type here's a goal, a long term goal to get from point A to point B that you can't really do in an arcade game so I think it's really interesting to kind of see that transition now I think this is really the first true transition that we see from DDR as an arcade series to now DDR as a home series

822
01:04:52,723 --> 01:04:53,644
[SPEAKER_02]: with Dance Master Mode.

823
01:04:54,144 --> 01:04:56,885
[SPEAKER_02]: So, is that a good thing or bad thing for the series?

824
01:04:56,945 --> 01:04:57,285
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

825
01:04:57,385 --> 01:05:06,849
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they kept an arcade-like thing in there still by having the free mode, which, you know, basically has the look and feel of a DDR arcade game.

826
01:05:06,869 --> 01:05:09,611
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's just very interesting that now the focus is on Dance Master Mode.

827
01:05:09,871 --> 01:05:12,812
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if you don't play through Dance Master Mode, you're not going to really unlock a lot of songs.

828
01:05:13,172 --> 01:05:20,315
[SPEAKER_02]: So I thought it was very interesting that the only songs that are available at the outset is the licensed songs.

829
01:05:21,676 --> 01:05:21,896
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

830
01:05:22,537 --> 01:05:24,117
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

831
01:05:43,740 --> 01:05:44,280
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the game.

832
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:44,820
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cool.

833
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:45,040
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just...

834
01:06:06,136 --> 01:06:06,756
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just different.

835
01:06:06,796 --> 01:06:08,157
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a different direction for the series.

836
01:06:08,257 --> 01:06:10,797
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I like it, though, as somebody who's a DDR fan.

837
01:06:11,117 --> 01:06:18,899
[SPEAKER_02]: If I was somebody who was buying DDR mixes just to have house parties, though, I'd be kind of ticked off at this mix because there's not a lot to it.

838
01:06:19,019 --> 01:06:23,300
[SPEAKER_02]: If you just buy it to play it once in a while, you know, let's get drunk and play DDR.

839
01:06:24,020 --> 01:06:28,301
[SPEAKER_25]: I'd probably be a little irritated with it because there's not a lot of songs to choose from.

840
01:06:28,721 --> 01:06:31,342
[SPEAKER_25]: But even though I'd say the casual person doesn't like playing

841
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:32,821
[SPEAKER_25]: All the stuff.

842
01:06:32,841 --> 01:06:34,942
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm sure that they're not that great at DDR.

843
01:06:35,182 --> 01:06:40,546
[SPEAKER_25]: You can play through the mission mode type stuff.

844
01:06:41,787 --> 01:06:45,290
[SPEAKER_25]: It starts off beginner stuff and goes all the way to really hard.

845
01:06:47,151 --> 01:06:47,452
[SPEAKER_25]: There you go.

846
01:06:47,472 --> 01:06:47,932
[SPEAKER_25]: You can get better.

847
01:06:48,479 --> 01:06:49,339
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's true.

848
01:06:49,419 --> 01:06:51,400
[SPEAKER_02]: The Dance Master Mode is kind of a way for you to get better.

849
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:55,001
[SPEAKER_02]: It actually reminded me a lot of 2DX.

850
01:06:55,201 --> 01:06:56,522
[SPEAKER_02]: What the hell did they call that in 2DX?

851
01:06:57,042 --> 01:06:57,482
[SPEAKER_02]: Drill Mode?

852
01:06:57,942 --> 01:06:58,462
[SPEAKER_02]: Trial Mode?

853
01:06:58,742 --> 01:06:59,042
[SPEAKER_02]: Drill.

854
01:06:59,182 --> 01:06:59,643
[SPEAKER_02]: Drill Mode.

855
01:06:59,663 --> 01:06:59,923
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

856
01:06:59,943 --> 01:07:01,843
[SPEAKER_02]: Drill Mode in 2DX 6th Style.

857
01:07:01,863 --> 01:07:09,906
[SPEAKER_02]: They had that Drill Mode, and I think it was in 5th Style as well, where it was like play these little sections of songs and meet these certain qualifications.

858
01:07:10,266 --> 01:07:12,847
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of like they took Drill Mode and really changed it.

859
01:07:12,887 --> 01:07:15,608
[SPEAKER_02]: And Drill Mode really helped me get better at 2DX.

860
01:07:15,688 --> 01:07:16,208
[SPEAKER_02]: It really did.

861
01:07:16,768 --> 01:07:17,729
[SPEAKER_02]: I like Spider Stomp.

862
01:07:46,383 --> 01:07:47,543
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sorry, I haven't played it.

863
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:49,104
[SPEAKER_17]: I wish I could contribute more to that.

864
01:07:49,264 --> 01:07:49,724
[SPEAKER_24]: That's all right.

865
01:07:50,684 --> 01:07:54,846
[SPEAKER_24]: You could maybe borrow my copy later this week or something if you want to check it out.

866
01:07:54,886 --> 01:07:56,006
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know when I would play it.

867
01:07:57,147 --> 01:07:58,627
[SPEAKER_25]: Spider Stomp is an excellent game.

868
01:07:58,987 --> 01:08:00,888
[SPEAKER_25]: Just there's no music, so it sucks.

869
01:08:01,288 --> 01:08:03,509
[SPEAKER_17]: I have Puyo Puyo to keep me happy on the MAME.

870
01:08:05,089 --> 01:08:08,990
[SPEAKER_17]: But we're discussing, though, buying a DDR machine.

871
01:08:10,271 --> 01:08:13,532
[SPEAKER_25]: Speaking of which, I'm not sure if you saw that I posted...

872
01:08:14,399 --> 01:08:21,221
[SPEAKER_25]: I went and opted to get the correct poppin' music buttons for my poppin' music controller, so they're gonna be arcade-style.

873
01:08:21,621 --> 01:08:22,081
[SPEAKER_10]: Very cool.

874
01:08:22,981 --> 01:08:24,202
[SPEAKER_25]: Can't wait for that to be done.

875
01:08:25,962 --> 01:08:29,943
[SPEAKER_17]: I wanna try to build one for myself, like, so that I can actually play on something other than the dinky pad.

876
01:08:30,143 --> 01:08:30,743
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, it'd be easy.

877
01:08:31,143 --> 01:08:33,944
[SPEAKER_25]: Just, the buttons are, like, 70 bucks.

878
01:08:35,684 --> 01:08:36,184
[SPEAKER_17]: Cheaper than 400?

879
01:08:36,264 --> 01:08:36,745
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

880
01:08:37,045 --> 01:08:37,905
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah.

881
01:08:38,545 --> 01:08:39,685
[SPEAKER_17]: You show me how to, I'll do it.

882
01:08:40,285 --> 01:08:40,866
[SPEAKER_25]: There's a fact.

883
01:08:41,266 --> 01:08:41,866
[SPEAKER_25]: I'll email it.

884
01:08:42,226 --> 01:08:42,306
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

885
01:08:42,326 --> 01:08:42,406
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

887
01:09:07,361 --> 01:09:13,626
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the favorite of Orange Lounge Radio, Paula Terry with Naoki with Passion of Love starting off this set.

888
01:09:14,147 --> 01:09:23,275
[SPEAKER_02]: Also in this break we're going to hear a Palafstian dance and chorus, Seduction, which you guys have been begging me to play since the beginning of the show, so you'll get that, as well as Silence in this break.

889
01:09:23,355 --> 01:09:25,156
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.

[SPEAKER_09]: Cheap and Normal

898
01:16:29,716 --> 01:16:39,387
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, we're back here on Orange Launch Radio, and people remind me in the future not to reset the router while we're trying to broadcast so that Loki can get on our wireless network with the PSP.

899
01:16:40,207 --> 01:16:40,648
[SPEAKER_02]: My bad.

900
01:16:40,888 --> 01:16:41,489
[SPEAKER_02]: My bad, kids.

901
01:16:42,310 --> 01:16:51,620
[SPEAKER_02]: So since that was kind of my bad, and I dropped a lot of you guys during the song that everybody in chat was like, OMG, waiting for, here it is again, one more time, Seduction.

902
01:16:59,895 --> 01:17:03,918

[SPEAKER_02]: Hello kids, we're back.

905
01:18:35,739 --> 01:18:37,500
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, stop complaining, you got to hear seduction.

906
01:18:38,401 --> 01:18:39,722
[SPEAKER_02]: My bad, people.

907
01:18:40,183 --> 01:18:41,303
[SPEAKER_02]: God, we all make mistakes.

908
01:18:43,145 --> 01:18:45,447
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of us more than others, granted, but we all make mistakes.

909
01:18:46,267 --> 01:18:57,536
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, I'm looking at this really cool new thing that Loki was a big part of putting together along with one of our other behind the scenes people, VXJasonXV, and it's very pretty.

910
01:18:57,976 --> 01:18:59,938
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we're going to announce it tonight on the podcast.

911
01:18:59,978 --> 01:19:03,540
[SPEAKER_02]: I just have to check with Jason and make sure everything's good to go.

912
01:19:04,021 --> 01:19:04,181
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah.

913
01:19:04,494 --> 01:19:05,314
[SPEAKER_02]: And where's Waldo?

914
01:19:29,456 --> 01:19:32,298
[SPEAKER_25]: and the added bonus, which I picked up last minute.

915
01:19:32,498 --> 01:19:32,919
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, really?

916
01:19:32,959 --> 01:19:36,701
[SPEAKER_25]: That was the brand new t-shirt, which says, In the Courtroom.

917
01:19:36,901 --> 01:19:38,042
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, did you get that?

918
01:19:38,402 --> 01:19:42,485
[SPEAKER_25]: I got one for myself and one for the winner.

919
01:19:42,825 --> 01:19:44,006
[SPEAKER_25]: Wow, awesome.

920
01:19:44,026 --> 01:19:47,688
[SPEAKER_02]: So somebody is going to win an In the Courtroom shirt, which is, what is this?

921
01:19:48,068 --> 01:19:50,810
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the In the Groove logo, but it says In the Courtroom.

922
01:19:50,990 --> 01:19:51,550
[SPEAKER_02]: That's beautiful.

923
01:19:52,531 --> 01:19:54,192
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so check that out.

924
01:19:55,279 --> 01:19:58,789
[SPEAKER_02]: So somebody's going to win the In the Groove thing and the In the Courtroom t-shirt.

925
01:19:59,552 --> 01:20:02,681
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, Miklatov wanted to throw some prizes in as well.

926
01:20:03,251 --> 01:20:04,752
[SPEAKER_02]: SILENTHILL3 STICKERS

927
01:20:27,655 --> 01:20:33,776
[SPEAKER_02]: Mikulatov gave us like 10 stickers, so we're going to just give them all away with other prizes that we give out later on throughout this month.

928
01:20:33,797 --> 01:20:39,238
[SPEAKER_25]: And I'm thinking there will be another contest to go with the announcement that we'll make on the podcast later as well.

929
01:20:39,558 --> 01:20:40,038
[SPEAKER_02]: Super!

930
01:20:40,158 --> 01:20:42,279
[SPEAKER_02]: We got tons of giveaway crap going on.

931
01:20:42,319 --> 01:20:42,619
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.

932
01:20:42,639 --> 01:20:43,739
[SPEAKER_25]: It's cleaning house.

933
01:20:43,979 --> 01:20:44,399
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.

934
01:20:44,499 --> 01:20:45,339
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to give away stuff.

935
01:20:45,359 --> 01:20:46,239
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's give away the ferret.

936
01:20:46,540 --> 01:20:47,580
[SPEAKER_25]: No, no, no.

937
01:20:47,620 --> 01:20:50,220
[SPEAKER_25]: We already gave away a ferret, and there was like three other ones.

938
01:20:50,240 --> 01:20:51,401
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, did we throw them all away?

939
01:20:52,481 --> 01:20:53,681
[SPEAKER_02]: They're hidden.

940
01:20:54,241 --> 01:20:54,601
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

941
01:20:54,641 --> 01:20:54,921
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

942
01:20:55,082 --> 01:20:55,342
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways.

943
01:20:56,122 --> 01:20:57,062
[SPEAKER_02]: They're in my butt.

944
01:20:58,018 --> 01:21:07,001
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, Skype line's open, and people are already hammering us on the Skype line, so if you want to call, head on over to OrangeLaunchRadio.com and click on Interact With Us, and we'll go to our first call.

945
01:21:07,061 --> 01:21:07,501
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello!

946
01:21:07,981 --> 01:21:08,841
[SPEAKER_02]: You're on Orange Launch Radio.

947
01:21:09,521 --> 01:21:11,022
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, Sephiroth1215 here.

948
01:21:11,142 --> 01:21:13,062
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, Sephiroth1215, what's on your mind?

949
01:21:13,082 --> 01:21:23,525
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically just extreme, too, but my first thought was, like, why was I playing in the groove over the summer?

950
01:21:24,666 --> 01:21:25,346
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, why?

951
01:21:30,379 --> 01:21:34,341
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I don't know, it just kind of revived the DDR back for me, at least.

952
01:21:35,081 --> 01:21:36,962
[SPEAKER_00]: Except for the arcades, of course, but still.

953
01:21:37,763 --> 01:21:43,946
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, I'm the one out of the three of us that doesn't hate on In the Groove as much.

954
01:21:44,886 --> 01:21:48,007
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, In the Groove for me was exactly like you're kind of referring to here.

955
01:21:48,388 --> 01:21:51,549
[SPEAKER_02]: In the Groove was holding me over between real DDR.

956
01:21:52,169 --> 01:21:53,830
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of how I felt about In the Groove.

957
01:21:53,890 --> 01:21:59,473
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of like, well, this is, you know, it's like, it's, I can't believe it's not DDR.

958
01:21:59,983 --> 01:22:00,864
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

959
01:22:29,759 --> 01:22:31,861
[SPEAKER_02]: That they didn't license any good music.

960
01:22:33,462 --> 01:22:41,348
[SPEAKER_02]: And to look at DDR Extreme 2's song list, which is pretty phenomenal, and really sucks the fans' collective cock in every way.

961
01:22:41,688 --> 01:22:47,112
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, honestly, every fan bitching that was going on on DDR Freak was really granted with this mix.

962
01:22:47,553 --> 01:22:49,434
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe not everything, but let's face it.

963
01:22:49,878 --> 01:22:53,361
[SPEAKER_02]: The people that were whining and bitching that they never got erotic, they got it.

964
01:22:53,621 --> 01:22:57,165
[SPEAKER_02]: The people that were whining and bitching that they were never going to get cartoon heroes, they got it.

965
01:22:57,405 --> 01:23:01,208
[SPEAKER_02]: The people that were bitching they were never going to get Sakura and Daikin Kai, they got it.

966
01:23:01,589 --> 01:23:03,511
[SPEAKER_02]: Albeit a little bit butchered, but they got it.

967
01:23:04,051 --> 01:23:09,096
[SPEAKER_02]: So this mix really delivered to the fans in every way, I think.

968
01:23:09,776 --> 01:23:10,077
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

969
01:23:10,998 --> 01:23:12,859
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, it's your call, not my monologue.

970
01:23:12,899 --> 01:23:13,700
[SPEAKER_02]: I keep cutting you off.

971
01:23:14,401 --> 01:23:15,722
[SPEAKER_02]: What are your other thoughts on Xtreme?

972
01:23:17,267 --> 01:23:26,760
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, well, first of all, yeah, I was really pissed about the Injection of Love thing, because it came up randomly, and I was happy, I was excited, I'm like, oh, what's Hina mean?

973
01:23:26,980 --> 01:23:30,525
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, all the lyrics are just gone, which just kind of ruined the song.

974
01:23:31,585 --> 01:24:00,119
[SPEAKER_02]: I like how I think somebody on Freak put it this way is that somebody said imagine you've never heard the 2DX Red version and I realize it's hard to do because you have heard the 2DX Red version but imagine for a minute you haven't heard the 2DX Red version as a standalone song it's not that bad there's been worse songs in DDR although I agree it's a little disappointing for the lyrics to be cut out of the song but you know there's all I can tell you is that there's a reason for everything so there's probably a really good reason why it turned out the way it did

975
01:24:01,055 --> 01:24:11,898
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if it's a reason for censoring, I think it's poor, because some of the other songs in there, like Get Busy, or even the Erotic song, I mean, I thought they weren't going to censor anything after that, since it got an E10 rating.

976
01:24:11,998 --> 01:24:12,738
[SPEAKER_02]: Think of it this way, though.

977
01:24:13,059 --> 01:24:14,679
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it wasn't done for censoring.

978
01:24:14,899 --> 01:24:17,620
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's assuming it was done for censoring, but what if it wasn't?

979
01:24:20,081 --> 01:24:24,282
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't really know, so... Just food for thought.

980
01:24:25,270 --> 01:24:29,794
[SPEAKER_00]: Just hoping maybe they'll put in Ultramix 3 or something, since they're probably better on that.

981
01:24:30,014 --> 01:24:36,960
[SPEAKER_00]: Which kind of reminds me, the quest mode in Ultramix 3 is probably going to be similar in some sort to this mission mode.

982
01:24:37,321 --> 01:24:50,052
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of thought about that too, that I'm wondering if the quest mode in Ultramix 3 is going to be the very central part of the game, such as Dance Master Mode was in this Dance Dance Extreme 2, but...

983
01:24:50,935 --> 01:25:04,610
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it will be, because honestly, from what I played at E3, and granted, a lot can change from E3 to the home release, because Ultramix 2 at last year's E3 sucked humongous, hairy, extrovert-loving balls, okay?

984
01:25:06,713 --> 01:25:06,933
[SPEAKER_02]: But...

985
01:25:08,202 --> 01:25:13,725
[SPEAKER_02]: The version that they ended up releasing is probably one of the best DDR mixes that they've ever put out.

986
01:25:13,765 --> 01:25:18,247
[SPEAKER_02]: And in my opinion, I think the song list in Ultramix 2 is better than Extreme 2's.

987
01:25:18,387 --> 01:25:20,549
[SPEAKER_02]: But I realize, you know, not everybody shares the same opinion.

988
01:25:20,889 --> 01:25:22,409
[SPEAKER_02]: But Ultramix 2 is phenomenal when they released it.

989
01:25:22,510 --> 01:25:27,112
[SPEAKER_02]: But Ultramix 3 at E3 this year, I can tell you, really didn't feel that much different from Ultramix 2.

990
01:25:27,392 --> 01:25:31,114
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just Ultramix 2 with new songs thrown in and hey, this new little quest mode.

991
01:25:31,678 --> 01:25:32,879
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I don't know.

992
01:25:34,201 --> 01:25:44,493
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, I think it was explained before as Quest World's probably going to be like that mode in Virtua Fighter 4 Evolution where you just go around different arcades and fight people.

993
01:25:46,543 --> 01:26:02,010
[SPEAKER_02]: Virtual Fighter 4 Evolution I didn't really play the Virtual Fighter Oh, Jamie's making the gag face I hate Virtual Fighter Sorry, we don't catch the reference because I don't really play a lot of fighting games I thought it was pretty, but I don't like Virtual Fighter What was the last fighting game I really liked?

994
01:26:02,150 --> 01:26:11,715
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Capcom vs. SNK 2 Tekken 5 Tekken was okay Anyway, I need to get to some other calls Do you have any other thoughts on DDR Extreme 2?

995
01:26:13,176 --> 01:26:13,876
[SPEAKER_02]: Not really, I think

996
01:26:14,423 --> 01:26:15,444
[SPEAKER_02]: Most people should buy it now.

997
01:26:15,804 --> 01:26:18,686
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean... If you're a fan of DDR, you need to have this game.

998
01:26:18,786 --> 01:26:19,126
[SPEAKER_02]: Period.

999
01:26:19,486 --> 01:26:21,288
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're a fan of music games, you need to have this game.

1000
01:26:21,328 --> 01:26:21,608
[SPEAKER_02]: Period.

1001
01:26:21,968 --> 01:26:28,252
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're a casual, hey, I like to play DDR when I'm drunk, you're probably not listening to this show, for one.

1002
01:26:28,893 --> 01:26:33,415
[SPEAKER_02]: But if that does happen to be you, you may not be so into this mix.

1003
01:26:33,455 --> 01:26:42,181
[SPEAKER_02]: I would recommend if you're going to start somewhere, like if you're a brand new, I'm brand new to DDR, I want to start somewhere in the series, I actually think Max 2 is the place to start for me.

1004
01:26:42,321 --> 01:26:43,262
[SPEAKER_02]: But I...

1005
01:26:44,409 --> 01:26:44,729
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1006
01:26:45,030 --> 01:26:45,810
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a toss-up.

1007
01:26:46,071 --> 01:26:46,391
[SPEAKER_02]: It's tough.

1008
01:26:48,433 --> 01:26:54,399
[SPEAKER_02]: One other thing I want to ask you, Sephiroth1215, what do you think about the Pump It Up custom soundtrack feature?

1009
01:26:55,760 --> 01:26:58,503
[SPEAKER_00]: Um... Alright, I guess it's okay.

1010
01:26:59,203 --> 01:27:02,767
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's not something I would probably use, but, I mean...

1011
01:27:04,381 --> 01:27:04,962
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1012
01:27:24,542 --> 01:27:25,663
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we'll see.

1013
01:27:26,083 --> 01:27:35,107
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see how we can't... If DDR is selling as well as everybody says it is, I say Ultramix or some version of Xbox DDR on the 360 is inevitable.

1014
01:27:35,667 --> 01:27:42,611
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe Konami now has something to dare to achieve in their Xbox series.

1015
01:27:42,691 --> 01:27:42,971
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows?

1016
01:27:43,411 --> 01:27:43,731
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

1017
01:27:46,713 --> 01:27:48,133
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well, we're going to let you go.

1018
01:27:48,153 --> 01:27:50,775
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to get to another call, but have a good night, and thanks for calling, alright?

1019
01:27:51,455 --> 01:27:52,035
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, you too.

1020
01:27:52,055 --> 01:27:52,595
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, take care.

1021
01:27:53,336 --> 01:27:53,516
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.

1022
01:27:53,576 --> 01:27:53,856
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye-bye.

1023
01:27:55,711 --> 01:27:57,052
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go to another call.

1024
01:27:57,212 --> 01:27:59,834
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it loud enough in studio for you, DarkSakura, or do I need to turn it up a little bit?

1025
01:28:00,034 --> 01:28:01,595
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't hear it badly at all.

1026
01:28:01,615 --> 01:28:02,595
[SPEAKER_02]: That was probably a little low.

1027
01:28:02,615 --> 01:28:03,976
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let me turn it up a little bit for you, okay?

1028
01:28:04,436 --> 01:28:05,677
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's go to another call.

1029
01:28:05,757 --> 01:28:08,859
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to take... I don't think we've heard from this one in a while.

1030
01:28:10,060 --> 01:28:11,361
[SPEAKER_23]: Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1031
01:28:14,042 --> 01:28:14,543
[SPEAKER_23]: Hello.

1032
01:28:15,223 --> 01:28:16,544
[SPEAKER_23]: Hello, yes, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1033
01:28:17,164 --> 01:28:17,925
[SPEAKER_23]: Hey, this is Dark Knight.

1034
01:28:18,085 --> 01:28:19,206
[SPEAKER_23]: Hey, Dark Knight, how you doing?

1035
01:28:19,886 --> 01:28:20,366
[SPEAKER_23]: Hello.

1036
01:28:21,207 --> 01:28:21,487
[SPEAKER_23]: Hey.

1037
01:28:22,708 --> 01:28:23,068
[SPEAKER_23]: Um, what...

1038
01:28:23,636 --> 01:28:26,577
[SPEAKER_15]: About the online mode on DDR EX 2.

1039
01:28:27,137 --> 01:28:28,737
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we didn't talk a lot about online mode.

1040
01:28:28,757 --> 01:28:30,438
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't played a whole lot of it, but what's up?

1041
01:28:31,258 --> 01:28:32,038
[SPEAKER_15]: I tried it.

1042
01:28:32,298 --> 01:28:38,860
[SPEAKER_15]: It has a major flaw, and that is you cannot pick your opponent, nor can you pick the song to play against.

1043
01:28:39,400 --> 01:28:40,440
[SPEAKER_15]: To play against with them.

1044
01:28:41,541 --> 01:28:42,941
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of weird.

1045
01:28:43,001 --> 01:28:50,383
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I guess, yeah, it's kind of one of those things, well, it's DDR's first adventures into the PlayStation Online realm, which...

1046
01:28:51,116 --> 01:28:59,823
[SPEAKER_02]: From what I understand, from a player perspective, the Sony online network is just not as good as Xbox Live.

1047
01:28:59,943 --> 01:29:02,565
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's just not as set up as well as Xbox Live is.

1048
01:29:03,166 --> 01:29:09,230
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm kind of not surprised that the online features aren't as good, but yeah, that is kind of weird that you can't even pick your song, of all things.

1049
01:29:09,791 --> 01:29:11,372
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, but I mean, it was okay.

1050
01:29:11,392 --> 01:29:12,833
[SPEAKER_15]: As far as gameplay went, it was alright.

1051
01:29:12,853 --> 01:29:13,894
[SPEAKER_15]: It was pretty synced up.

1052
01:29:14,194 --> 01:29:14,435
[SPEAKER_15]: Really?

1053
01:29:14,475 --> 01:29:17,197
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, it was pretty synced up when I played my match.

1054
01:29:17,297 --> 01:29:17,457
[SPEAKER_15]: It was

1055
01:29:18,218 --> 01:29:22,581
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna have to get on there and kick some ass on DDR.

1056
01:29:22,821 --> 01:29:24,962
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you tell if people are using a controller or not?

1057
01:29:26,323 --> 01:29:27,784
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, no, you really can't.

1058
01:29:28,604 --> 01:29:29,265
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.

1059
01:29:30,225 --> 01:29:31,306
[SPEAKER_15]: You really can't.

1060
01:29:31,406 --> 01:29:32,867
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a button button master.

1061
01:29:32,887 --> 01:29:34,488
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna get on there and kick some butt.

1062
01:29:35,028 --> 01:29:39,051
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll play against somebody, and he's playing on heavy, and I killed him.

1063
01:29:39,671 --> 01:29:39,991
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

1064
01:29:40,031 --> 01:29:40,311
[SPEAKER_02]: See, and...

1065
01:29:41,658 --> 01:29:47,987
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel kind of bad for admitting to that, but at the same time, you know they're all playing on controller.

1066
01:29:50,049 --> 01:29:59,162
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe there's one or two guys out there playing on a dance pad on Heavy, and props to you guys for having the guts to do it, but come on, they're all playing on controller.

1067
01:30:00,222 --> 01:30:01,262
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1068
01:30:22,708 --> 01:30:29,149
[SPEAKER_02]: I will still play light and standard songs on a dance pad against someone on a controller because on Xbox you can see what they're using.

1069
01:30:29,810 --> 01:30:38,312
[SPEAKER_02]: But if they're using a controller... Whoa, we just had a major net split on IRC, and I think I split from the rest of the chatroom, but hopefully they'll reconnect soon.

1070
01:30:38,932 --> 01:30:41,252
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, just wanted to give that update.

1071
01:30:42,252 --> 01:30:47,254
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I mean, like I said, other than that, the normal mode, yeah, deathmatch mode, pretty good.

1072
01:30:47,274 --> 01:30:49,234
[SPEAKER_15]: That way you can open the songs a little more quicker.

1073
01:30:50,323 --> 01:30:57,870
[SPEAKER_15]: But at the same time though, it depends on the player's skill on a home pad because right now I'm just working on the B course right now.

1074
01:30:58,710 --> 01:31:01,332
[SPEAKER_15]: I ain't even hit the hard levels yet.

1075
01:31:01,473 --> 01:31:10,420
[SPEAKER_02]: I've actually been pretty good about sticking to playing Dance Master mode strictly on a dance pad because I want to get back into actively playing DDR.

1076
01:31:10,700 --> 01:31:12,482
[SPEAKER_02]: When I say actively, meaning like I'm actually...

1077
01:31:13,266 --> 01:31:13,787
[SPEAKER_02]: Step on 150 Arrows

1078
01:31:36,294 --> 01:31:40,158
[SPEAKER_02]: but not any of the arrows that are actually in the step chart.

1079
01:31:40,359 --> 01:31:44,403
[SPEAKER_02]: If you step on one of the arrows that are actually in the step chart, you lose.

1080
01:31:45,084 --> 01:31:51,331
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's on FAQ, if you step on the down arrows, you will fail.

1081
01:31:52,788 --> 01:31:56,811
[SPEAKER_02]: There's another mission like that too where you can't step on any down arrows and it's really hard to do.

1082
01:31:57,251 --> 01:32:01,113
[SPEAKER_02]: I tried doing that mission on a dance pad.

1083
01:32:01,153 --> 01:32:03,695
[SPEAKER_02]: I could not get 150 notes to register with my feet.

1084
01:32:04,355 --> 01:32:07,837
[SPEAKER_15]: I think of one song where you have to intentionally play bad to pass.

1085
01:32:08,297 --> 01:32:11,079
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's a whole bunch of weird stuff there in Dance Master Mode.

1086
01:32:11,319 --> 01:32:15,782
[SPEAKER_15]: I was like, do I have to literally get a D to pass a song?

1087
01:32:16,242 --> 01:32:17,122
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, I'll just step off.

1088
01:32:17,303 --> 01:32:17,983
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good attack.

1089
01:32:18,905 --> 01:32:24,830
[SPEAKER_02]: One other thing I want to ask you, Dark Knight, before we go to another call, what do you think about the Pump It Up thing, the custom soundtrack thing on Pump It Up?

1090
01:32:26,191 --> 01:32:30,174
[SPEAKER_15]: That's just like a major, maybe it might be a major code goof, i.e.

1091
01:32:30,214 --> 01:32:34,898
[SPEAKER_15]: hot coffee, but hey, to each his own.

1092
01:32:35,278 --> 01:32:40,502
[SPEAKER_02]: So are you saying that kids everywhere now can make, you know, Step Files to Porn soundtracks, or...?

1093
01:32:43,106 --> 01:32:44,487
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't like where you're going that far.

1094
01:32:44,787 --> 01:32:48,388
[SPEAKER_15]: The only thing I can think of though, Xbox Live, you can't upload.

1095
01:32:49,609 --> 01:32:50,309
[SPEAKER_15]: Can you?

1096
01:32:51,190 --> 01:32:51,770
[SPEAKER_15]: I think.

1097
01:32:52,910 --> 01:32:53,250
[SPEAKER_02]: How?

1098
01:32:53,530 --> 01:32:54,231
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how to do it.

1099
01:32:57,372 --> 01:33:00,753
[SPEAKER_02]: You can upload if the game allows it, but Pump It Up doesn't allow it.

1100
01:33:01,414 --> 01:33:02,094
[SPEAKER_02]: Ultramix 2 does though.

1101
01:33:02,114 --> 01:33:02,374
[SPEAKER_15]: Does?

1102
01:33:02,394 --> 01:33:03,675
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, Ultramix 2 does.

1103
01:33:08,087 --> 01:33:11,929
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe somebody might get funny outside and maybe find a code for it.

1104
01:33:12,009 --> 01:33:12,449
[SPEAKER_02]: You never know.

1105
01:33:12,529 --> 01:33:13,429
[SPEAKER_02]: You never know what might happen.

1106
01:33:14,930 --> 01:33:34,018
[SPEAKER_02]: If Microsoft really does plan on setting up this big music store for their 360 that's going to compete with iTunes or whatever, which is a big rumor, they're going to set up their own music store to compete with iTunes via the 360, wouldn't that be interesting that not only could you download the song, but then you could also have, hey, you could have this fan step chart in DDR that you download with it.

1107
01:33:34,258 --> 01:33:38,100
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, that would be kind of cheesy, but I could see it happening, I don't know, might be a way to do it.

1108
01:33:39,140 --> 01:33:44,923
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, anyway, we're going to let you go, see if we can get to another call, but thank you so much for calling in tonight, and have a good one.

1109
01:33:45,163 --> 01:33:46,864
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, later.

1110
01:33:47,885 --> 01:33:48,825
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's go to another call.

1111
01:33:49,225 --> 01:33:50,306
[SPEAKER_02]: One more, guys, before break.

1112
01:33:51,987 --> 01:33:53,007
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.

1113
01:33:53,607 --> 01:33:54,928
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, what's up, it's Ron Chan.

1114
01:33:54,988 --> 01:33:56,469
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, Ron Chan, what's on your mind?

1115
01:33:57,049 --> 01:33:58,190
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, what's up?

1116
01:33:58,790 --> 01:34:02,812
[SPEAKER_24]: Hey, not too much, just, you know, been playing the hell out of Extreme 2, how about you?

1117
01:34:03,703 --> 01:34:04,964
[SPEAKER_21]: I've been playing the older mixes.

1118
01:34:05,004 --> 01:34:08,325
[SPEAKER_21]: As soon as I get a job, I'll pick up Xtreme 2 and have fun with that.

1119
01:34:09,186 --> 01:34:10,567
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so you're still on the older mixes.

1120
01:34:10,587 --> 01:34:11,067
[SPEAKER_02]: That's alright.

1121
01:34:11,427 --> 01:34:13,908
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm following what's going on.

1122
01:34:13,968 --> 01:34:16,690
[SPEAKER_21]: Everybody's bitching this song.

1123
01:34:16,890 --> 01:34:21,452
[SPEAKER_21]: Look, if you want this song that badly, buy the import or shut the fuck up.

1124
01:34:22,493 --> 01:34:23,433
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't see...

1125
01:34:26,005 --> 01:34:28,467
[SPEAKER_02]: People are always going to find something to complain about.

1126
01:34:28,507 --> 01:34:29,448
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just inevitable.

1127
01:34:29,828 --> 01:34:32,090
[SPEAKER_02]: But this mix is pretty solid, honestly.

1128
01:34:32,951 --> 01:34:35,193
[SPEAKER_21]: Overall, you can't make people happy.

1129
01:34:35,213 --> 01:34:35,793
[SPEAKER_21]: That's all it is.

1130
01:34:37,415 --> 01:34:37,775
[SPEAKER_21]: That's true.

1131
01:34:38,916 --> 01:34:41,779
[SPEAKER_21]: But let's take a little step from DDL.

1132
01:34:41,859 --> 01:34:43,260
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's do a little para para.

1133
01:34:43,700 --> 01:34:47,503
[SPEAKER_21]: In case you haven't heard, I went to the Yoko Ishida concert in New York City today.

1134
01:34:48,424 --> 01:34:49,185
[SPEAKER_21]: Ah, how was that?

1135
01:34:49,905 --> 01:34:51,006
[SPEAKER_21]: It was awesome.

1136
01:34:51,106 --> 01:34:53,468
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm posting pictures from the concert.

1137
01:34:53,548 --> 01:34:55,349
[SPEAKER_21]: It was a free concert at the Manhattan Mall.

1138
01:34:55,770 --> 01:35:01,394
[SPEAKER_21]: It took about 100 pictures, and if you go through the pictures, you'll see a lot of people up there power-powering as well.

1139
01:35:01,894 --> 01:35:03,375
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that is so gay.

1140
01:35:03,576 --> 01:35:04,156
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's cool.

1141
01:35:04,196 --> 01:35:04,716
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's great.

1142
01:35:05,417 --> 01:35:08,259
[SPEAKER_21]: I didn't power-power because I was too busy taking pictures and stuff.

1143
01:35:09,920 --> 01:35:14,644
[SPEAKER_21]: I had fun, but one thing that always pisses me off is the fact that when they don't have any type of

1144
01:35:15,387 --> 01:35:16,928
[SPEAKER_21]: Anime or Video Game Gathering, whatever.

1145
01:35:17,088 --> 01:35:20,029
[SPEAKER_21]: You have that one fanboy that pisses you off.

1146
01:35:20,189 --> 01:35:23,551
[SPEAKER_21]: You just want to strangle him and your friends are like, no, don't.

1147
01:35:23,871 --> 01:35:24,551
[SPEAKER_21]: It's not worth it.

1148
01:35:25,491 --> 01:35:27,652
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking at some of these pictures very randomly on the site.

1149
01:35:27,692 --> 01:35:28,333
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, don't they look cute?

1150
01:35:28,373 --> 01:35:29,733
[SPEAKER_02]: You were up near the front, weren't you?

1151
01:35:30,474 --> 01:35:31,354
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

1152
01:35:31,434 --> 01:35:41,759
[SPEAKER_21]: If you look at this one picture I'm about to post, this is when I got my Powerpuff Mix CDs signed and stuff like that.

1153
01:35:41,839 --> 01:35:42,599
[SPEAKER_24]: All right, go you.

1154
01:35:43,835 --> 01:35:48,897
[SPEAKER_21]: and the one before that, my friend Aaron, we pushed him onto the stage so he could do Power Power as well.

1155
01:35:49,637 --> 01:35:50,677
[SPEAKER_21]: How many people were at this thing?

1156
01:35:52,098 --> 01:35:54,298
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, there was about 40 people downstairs.

1157
01:35:54,398 --> 01:35:58,700
[SPEAKER_21]: Now, everybody around the first and second floors is about 100 or so.

1158
01:36:00,580 --> 01:36:03,381
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, it was just so awesome.

1159
01:36:03,681 --> 01:36:10,624
[SPEAKER_21]: Words really can't describe per se, but I did find somebody that videotaped it, so I'm trying to get a copy of the footage of the concert.

1160
01:36:10,864 --> 01:36:11,444
[SPEAKER_21]: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

1161
01:36:12,390 --> 01:36:13,390
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, I remember that guy.

1162
01:36:13,430 --> 01:36:14,950
[SPEAKER_02]: I met that guy when I was in Jersey.

1163
01:36:15,611 --> 01:36:16,411
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, Aaron.

1164
01:36:16,431 --> 01:36:16,931
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1165
01:36:16,951 --> 01:36:17,451
[SPEAKER_02]: The fanboy.

1166
01:36:17,591 --> 01:36:18,131
[SPEAKER_02]: Alrighty.

1167
01:36:18,571 --> 01:36:18,991
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

1168
01:36:19,151 --> 01:36:21,352
[SPEAKER_02]: He looks very happy to be with those three sexy ladies there.

1169
01:36:22,272 --> 01:36:22,512
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1170
01:36:23,032 --> 01:36:23,552
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

1171
01:36:24,212 --> 01:36:30,433
[SPEAKER_21]: What we did was after we took the pictures, we went back and wished Yoko Ishida a happy birthday because her birthday is this Friday.

1172
01:36:30,653 --> 01:36:31,133
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, right on.

1173
01:36:32,073 --> 01:36:40,275
[SPEAKER_21]: And I also found out that supposedly she's going to be on live with Regis and Kathy Lee, no, Regis and Kelly doing Power Power this Friday.

1174
01:36:40,415 --> 01:36:40,855
[SPEAKER_21]: No way.

1175
01:36:41,423 --> 01:36:42,325
[SPEAKER_09]: That's going to be awesome.

1176
01:36:42,345 --> 01:36:44,308
[SPEAKER_09]: Who needs to take that?

1177
01:36:44,508 --> 01:36:45,610
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I've heard.

1178
01:36:45,851 --> 01:36:52,842
[SPEAKER_02]: Big props to Ranchan, by the way, because that's the first time in about five years where I said, no way, and then I got the response, way.

1179
01:36:54,977 --> 01:36:56,358
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so gonna TiVo that I'm so gonna TiVo that too

1180
01:37:14,185 --> 01:37:17,706
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like that, there's a comment in the chatroom, somebody needs to TiVo that.

1181
01:37:17,826 --> 01:37:18,567
[SPEAKER_02]: I will TiVo it.

1182
01:37:19,607 --> 01:37:22,728
[SPEAKER_02]: Or Comcast Ghetto Knockoff TiVo, whatever they call it.

1183
01:37:23,208 --> 01:37:27,410
[SPEAKER_21]: You do realize, somebody's going to TiVo it, and it's going to end up on a torrent site somewhere.

1184
01:37:27,450 --> 01:37:34,752
[SPEAKER_02]: Good, because we haven't done movie time on Orange Lounge Radio in months, so we need a good thing to skewer, so I'm excited.

1185
01:37:35,733 --> 01:37:38,394
[SPEAKER_21]: Speaking of movies, one of my friends saw Serenity.

1186
01:37:38,454 --> 01:37:39,274
[SPEAKER_21]: This is what he said.

1187
01:37:39,734 --> 01:37:42,195
[SPEAKER_21]: I liked Serenity when it was called Outlaw Star.

1188
01:37:44,770 --> 01:37:48,833
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard people complaining that it's way too similar to certain animes out there.

1189
01:37:49,213 --> 01:37:50,614
[SPEAKER_02]: Here comes Extaper the Weed and Whore.

1190
01:37:54,657 --> 01:37:54,917
[SPEAKER_16]: What?

1191
01:37:54,997 --> 01:37:57,519
[SPEAKER_02]: I just grabbed the mic.

1192
01:37:57,699 --> 01:38:00,901
[SPEAKER_16]: I just heard Serenity, so I automatically darted for the mic.

1193
01:38:00,961 --> 01:38:02,682
[SPEAKER_16]: Is it a rip-off of popular animes?

1194
01:38:03,303 --> 01:38:04,964
[SPEAKER_16]: I have no clue because I don't watch anime.

1195
01:38:05,004 --> 01:38:05,144
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1196
01:38:07,116 --> 01:38:09,900
[SPEAKER_16]: But if it is, it's really good, and I recommend it.

1197
01:38:09,920 --> 01:38:11,963
[SPEAKER_16]: Go out to your nearest theater.

1198
01:38:11,983 --> 01:38:12,563
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, I don't know.

1199
01:38:12,764 --> 01:38:13,385
[SPEAKER_21]: I guess it happens.

1200
01:38:13,405 --> 01:38:14,526
[SPEAKER_21]: What can you say?

1201
01:38:23,416 --> 01:38:27,217
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, maybe he was indirectly inspired.

1202
01:38:27,277 --> 01:38:28,718
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's a fancy coincidence.

1203
01:38:28,778 --> 01:38:29,158
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1204
01:38:29,238 --> 01:38:31,779
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, there was the whole show that preceded it.

1205
01:38:31,819 --> 01:38:35,641
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of tough to decide that your movie is going to rip it off after the fact.

1206
01:38:36,201 --> 01:38:40,122
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, from what I understand, the series ripped off Outlaw Star and Cowboy Bebop.

1207
01:38:40,142 --> 01:38:42,983
[SPEAKER_21]: But, hey, everybody steals from somebody.

1208
01:38:43,483 --> 01:38:44,144
[SPEAKER_24]: That is true.

1209
01:38:44,164 --> 01:38:44,824
[SPEAKER_24]: I agree with that.

1210
01:38:44,844 --> 01:38:46,625
[SPEAKER_24]: Imitation is the finest form of flattery, right?

1211
01:38:46,645 --> 01:38:47,045
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm.

1212
01:38:47,145 --> 01:38:47,585
[SPEAKER_24]: All right.

1213
01:38:48,823 --> 01:38:49,364
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1214
01:38:49,784 --> 01:38:51,546
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to go ahead and let you go, Ranchan.

1215
01:38:51,706 --> 01:38:53,027
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much for calling in, okay?

1216
01:38:53,067 --> 01:38:53,427
[SPEAKER_02]: Peace.

1217
01:38:54,368 --> 01:38:55,209
[SPEAKER_02]: Take care, fellas.

1218
01:38:55,269 --> 01:38:55,829
[SPEAKER_02]: Peace, y'all.

1219
01:38:55,850 --> 01:38:56,330
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a good one.

1220
01:38:57,131 --> 01:38:58,352
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye, DarkSakura.

1221
01:38:58,732 --> 01:39:00,334
[SPEAKER_02]: She actually had to run out to take a call real quick.

1222
01:39:00,354 --> 01:39:01,395
[SPEAKER_09]: She said bye.

1223
01:39:02,856 --> 01:39:03,196
[SPEAKER_02]: Later.

1224
01:39:05,178 --> 01:39:05,418
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1225
01:39:05,438 --> 01:39:08,721
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to go to one more call here since I don't want to get in a cage match with that DarkSakura.

1226
01:39:08,761 --> 01:39:12,264
[SPEAKER_02]: So our old buddy Zaku is hammering the line.

1227
01:39:13,265 --> 01:39:14,286
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, as always.

1228
01:39:14,426 --> 01:39:14,987
[SPEAKER_02]: As always.

1229
01:39:15,666 --> 01:39:16,547
[SPEAKER_02]: What's on your mind?

1230
01:39:17,287 --> 01:39:19,048
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you've got an opinion.

1231
01:39:19,088 --> 01:39:21,609
[SPEAKER_02]: If anybody's got an opinion on Xtreme 2, I know you've got one.

1232
01:39:21,670 --> 01:39:22,190
[SPEAKER_02]: So what is it?

1233
01:39:22,250 --> 01:39:43,942
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, first of all, since I'm too broke to buy me a PS2, thus I don't have the game, but I have been hearing around that it's pretty good that people, especially within the city, there's a lot of city players I heard who are actually playing the game and actually going through the hell of Dance Master mode.

1234
01:39:43,962 --> 01:39:44,783
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh-huh.

1235
01:39:45,339 --> 01:39:46,781
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think about Dan's master mode?

1236
01:39:46,841 --> 01:39:52,608
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it appropriate for DDR on a home mix or should they have just stuck to the make it look like the arcade?

1237
01:39:53,690 --> 01:39:59,196
[SPEAKER_14]: In other words, it only appeases to one type of player, like a hardcore person, like a seasoned DDR player.

1238
01:40:00,678 --> 01:40:01,279
[SPEAKER_14]: Dan's Master Mode

1239
01:40:20,695 --> 01:40:31,984
[SPEAKER_14]: It depends, I mean, from what I'm hearing, like, certain challenges where you can't step on the original arrows, or you can't step on this particular arrow, which is basically an in-the-group rip-off, if you ask me.

1240
01:40:32,084 --> 01:40:33,606
[SPEAKER_14]: Those, well, now, wait a minute.

1241
01:40:33,626 --> 01:40:39,090
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, mines, come on, come on, you gotta admit, Konami's trying to play the mine card in this one.

1242
01:40:39,110 --> 01:40:42,973
[SPEAKER_02]: But, poison arrows existed in Ultramix before that, and other mission modes, so...

1243
01:40:45,835 --> 01:40:46,576
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, please.

1244
01:40:46,796 --> 01:40:52,561
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like when, you know, I could say that In The Groove ripped off the multiple arrow idea from either Pump It Up or DDR Solo.

1245
01:40:52,601 --> 01:40:56,064
[SPEAKER_02]: Both of all had multiple arrows, so it's... Yeah, but not more than two.

1246
01:40:56,084 --> 01:40:57,965
[SPEAKER_14]: How about more than two at the same time?

1247
01:40:58,125 --> 01:41:05,071
[SPEAKER_25]: Actually, DDR Dancing Stage or DDR First Mix, one of the songs that was supposed to be on there, had three arrows at one time.

1248
01:41:06,112 --> 01:41:11,716
[SPEAKER_02]: But... Solo... Okay, the step charts for Dropout Maniac on DDR Solo has four.

1249
01:41:11,756 --> 01:41:12,537
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to hit four at once.

1250
01:41:13,447 --> 01:41:20,172
[SPEAKER_14]: Hmm, alright, anyways, MTV2 had their video mods thing on Friday.

1251
01:41:20,233 --> 01:41:21,694
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, how did that go?

1252
01:41:22,514 --> 01:41:26,778
[SPEAKER_14]: I couldn't catch the beginning though, so I can't vouch for what they had for DDR Extreme 2.

1253
01:41:27,138 --> 01:41:33,143
[SPEAKER_14]: So, you know, they're going to air it again in about two and a half hours from now, East Coast time.

1254
01:41:34,244 --> 01:41:38,087
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'll probably see that beginning part when they had it.

1255
01:41:38,627 --> 01:41:41,109
[SPEAKER_14]: What the hell was the DDR reference on this thing?

1256
01:41:43,755 --> 01:41:45,436
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know because I didn't see that.

1257
01:41:45,636 --> 01:41:47,538
[SPEAKER_14]: I couldn't catch the beginning of the video.

1258
01:41:47,558 --> 01:41:48,378
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, what good are you?

1259
01:41:48,999 --> 01:41:49,559
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just kidding.

1260
01:41:49,699 --> 01:41:57,345
[SPEAKER_14]: As I said, you know, they're going to air it again in like 1.30 tonight, so obviously I'm going to be able to stay up to see it.

1261
01:41:57,365 --> 01:41:59,026
[SPEAKER_14]: So I can't vouch for it now.

1262
01:41:59,426 --> 01:42:00,287
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll set the TiVo.

1263
01:42:01,528 --> 01:42:02,068
[SPEAKER_14]: So we'll see.

1264
01:42:02,188 --> 01:42:04,229
[SPEAKER_14]: I wish I had a TiVo.

1265
01:42:06,431 --> 01:42:07,392
[SPEAKER_14]: Besides, yeah.

1266
01:42:07,552 --> 01:42:10,634
[SPEAKER_02]: Zaku, I want to know your thoughts on the Pump It Up thing, the custom soundtrack.

1267
01:42:11,343 --> 01:42:14,867
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, let me... Obviously, this is no surprise.

1268
01:42:15,087 --> 01:42:23,315
[SPEAKER_14]: Xbox is pretty much so... You could pretty much sell an Xbox on the whole idea of basically playing games with your own tracks.

1269
01:42:23,375 --> 01:42:24,777
[SPEAKER_14]: Except none of them use it.

1270
01:42:25,715 --> 01:42:30,796
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, well, I've seen a lot of, there's some folks I know that actually use it in certain games.

1271
01:42:31,637 --> 01:42:35,418
[SPEAKER_14]: But anyways, the whole thing, it's too basic, in other words.

1272
01:42:35,658 --> 01:42:40,519
[SPEAKER_14]: Because it's not a robust step editor, in my honest opinion.

1273
01:42:40,559 --> 01:42:44,920
[SPEAKER_14]: You need something, obviously, to find the BPM, but also something to calculate the gap.

1274
01:42:45,620 --> 01:42:48,901
[SPEAKER_14]: And something to assist you, you know, to take every measure.

1275
01:42:49,381 --> 01:42:52,342
[SPEAKER_14]: So that way, you know, your song, so that way you can make your song sync up.

1276
01:42:53,391 --> 01:42:55,793
[SPEAKER_14]: And so, you know, it doesn't feel robust.

1277
01:42:57,134 --> 01:43:00,216
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you've got to check out the pump editor, though.

1278
01:43:00,276 --> 01:43:05,340
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very similar to a DDR editor, but just with some extra stuff there to support the custom soundtrack.

1279
01:43:06,741 --> 01:43:07,042
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1280
01:43:09,043 --> 01:43:10,124
[SPEAKER_02]: Zaku, I'm hanging up on you now.

1281
01:43:10,144 --> 01:43:11,185
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got a cage match to get to.

1282
01:43:12,246 --> 01:43:12,566
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1283
01:43:12,586 --> 01:43:13,006
[SPEAKER_02]: Later, man.

1284
01:43:13,026 --> 01:43:13,427
[SPEAKER_02]: Take care.

1285
01:43:13,447 --> 01:43:13,947
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.

1286
01:43:14,087 --> 01:43:14,708
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for coming.

1287
01:43:16,247 --> 01:43:19,649
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, we're going to get into the Orange Lounge Cage Match here momentarily there.

1288
01:43:20,589 --> 01:43:21,830
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting calls tonight, yeah?

1289
01:43:22,910 --> 01:43:23,210
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

1290
01:43:25,531 --> 01:43:29,753
[SPEAKER_02]: I was trying to think if there's any other things, little pieces of news I wanted to get to.

1291
01:43:29,893 --> 01:43:37,056
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess not, so why don't we get into the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match, which I'm so not set up for, by the way.

1292
01:43:38,057 --> 01:43:40,398
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I need somebody to stretch some time, because I'm so not set up for tonight.

1293
01:43:40,418 --> 01:43:44,279
[SPEAKER_25]: The question is, has anyone actually played the Karaoke Revolution party demo yet?

1294
01:43:45,200 --> 01:43:45,600
[SPEAKER_25]: I haven't.

1295
01:43:46,818 --> 01:43:50,500
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I haven't because I can't find my microphone.

1296
01:43:50,600 --> 01:43:51,981
[SPEAKER_17]: Jamie doesn't sing in public.

1297
01:43:52,581 --> 01:43:54,583
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you can play in the privacy of your own home if you so choose.

1298
01:43:57,664 --> 01:43:59,285
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't sing outside of my car.

1299
01:44:02,387 --> 01:44:04,108
[SPEAKER_17]: I would play it if it had gorillas.

1300
01:44:04,949 --> 01:44:07,250
[SPEAKER_25]: Karaoke Revolution Automobile Edition.

1301
01:44:07,470 --> 01:44:08,731
[SPEAKER_25]: Singing in your car.

1302
01:44:09,997 --> 01:44:38,643
[SPEAKER_02]: karaoke revolution for your cell phone maybe in fact that's what they should have as one of the stages you know you're singing in your car or you're singing in your shower oh yeah cause like how you sing in different locations like you know you're at the country bar and then you're at the super bowl or whatever it's called they should have the first stage that you're singing on the toilet or something they need to have like the toys level where you're in the bathroom at the toys factory from toys singing in the corner

1303
01:44:40,037 --> 01:44:40,337
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

1304
01:44:40,537 --> 01:44:41,318
[SPEAKER_17]: I love that movie.

1305
01:44:42,558 --> 01:44:42,898
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1306
01:44:43,379 --> 01:44:44,259
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm ready for the cage match.

1307
01:44:44,299 --> 01:44:44,719
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you guys?

1308
01:44:45,300 --> 01:44:45,460
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1309
01:44:45,660 --> 01:44:46,140
[SPEAKER_17]: Sure.

1310
01:44:46,240 --> 01:44:46,520
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1311
01:44:46,560 --> 01:44:46,960
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do it.

1312
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,962
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get into tonight's Orange Lounge Radio cage match.

1313
01:44:52,315 --> 01:44:57,316
[SPEAKER_02]: The way the cage match works, boys and girls, we're going to put three songs in, and they're going to do battle head-to-head against each other.

1314
01:44:57,937 --> 01:45:10,080
[SPEAKER_02]: And you guys will vote for your favorite, and the winning song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's Ramani Music and Video Game Music program, which plays 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, on this station where we're not here.

1315
01:45:10,740 --> 01:45:12,921
[SPEAKER_02]: It's your guys' vote that makes or breaks the cage match.

1316
01:45:13,281 --> 01:45:16,962
[SPEAKER_02]: The rule for how a song gets put in cage match is

1317
01:45:17,796 --> 01:45:19,197
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to want to put it in GageMatch.

1318
01:45:19,217 --> 01:45:20,177
[SPEAKER_02]: There's really no other rules.

1319
01:45:20,237 --> 01:45:21,758
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't have to be a Bomani song.

1320
01:45:21,778 --> 01:45:24,260
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't have to be a 2005 song.

1321
01:45:24,300 --> 01:45:27,742
[SPEAKER_02]: It just has to be something cool that we want to play on the air for you guys.

1322
01:45:28,122 --> 01:45:33,205
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to start off with last week's winner, of which you're only going to hear a clip of because it was last week's winner.

1323
01:45:33,965 --> 01:45:35,906
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's going to be song number one you're going to hear tonight.

1324
01:45:35,947 --> 01:45:39,188
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a remix of V from the Diverse Systems collections.

1325
01:45:39,228 --> 01:45:39,949
[SPEAKER_02]: What's Diverse Systems?

1326
01:45:39,989 --> 01:45:40,989
[SPEAKER_02]: Was this 8?

1327
01:45:41,430 --> 01:45:40,989
9?

1328
01:45:41,450 --> 01:45:46,933
[SPEAKER_02]: 9.

1329
01:45:41,770 --> 01:45:46,933
[SPEAKER_02]: From Diverse Systems 9, this is last week's winner, Dorisia with V. Enjoy.

1330
01:45:46,993 --> 01:45:47,093
[SPEAKER_02]: Enjoy.

1331
01:48:10,734 --> 01:48:14,396
[SPEAKER_02]: Song number one in tonight's cage match, V, a little remix there.

1332
01:48:15,377 --> 01:48:20,420
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, we're going to get into the rest of the cage match tonight, and we're going to go into song number two, which is Jamie's pick.

1333
01:48:20,881 --> 01:48:23,102
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie, I had a hard time figuring out what your pick was.

1334
01:48:23,202 --> 01:48:24,763
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you care to explain it here?

1335
01:48:25,644 --> 01:48:30,026
[SPEAKER_17]: I couldn't think of anything because I was busy doing my last bit of illustrator homework.

1336
01:48:30,487 --> 01:48:37,832
[SPEAKER_17]: So this is from Team America World Police, the montage song, because I couldn't think of anything else.

1337
01:48:38,132 --> 01:48:38,452
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1338
01:48:38,809 --> 01:48:42,390
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the montage song from Team America World Police.

1339
01:48:42,550 --> 01:48:44,011
[SPEAKER_02]: Also featured in South Park.

1340
01:48:44,631 --> 01:48:46,472
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a very random pick, I must say.

1341
01:48:46,792 --> 01:48:48,852
[SPEAKER_17]: I couldn't think of anything.

1342
01:48:49,853 --> 01:48:50,513
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, here it is.

1343
01:48:50,553 --> 01:48:52,294
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to go into song number two tonight.

1344
01:48:52,794 --> 01:48:55,955
[SPEAKER_02]: It is the montage from Team America World Police.

1345
01:49:15,669 --> 01:49:33,131
[SPEAKER_06]: And show us the passage of time, we're gonna need a montage Show like things happening at once, remind everyone of what's going on And with every shot, show a little of who

1346
01:49:47,620 --> 01:49:55,215
Just a beginner to a pro, you need a montage Even Rocky had a montage

1347
01:50:23,752 --> 01:50:24,972
Thank you for watching!

1348
01:51:01,125 --> 01:51:05,569
[SPEAKER_02]: Song number two in tonight's cage match, Montage from Team America World Police.

1349
01:51:05,629 --> 01:51:07,610
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely a random pick, but let's see.

1350
01:51:07,730 --> 01:51:09,592
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, what did you think of that on a scale of one to ten?

1351
01:51:09,912 --> 01:51:10,953
[SPEAKER_02]: Ten, fuck yeah!

1352
01:51:12,574 --> 01:51:14,156
[SPEAKER_25]: X to fur on a scale of one to ten?

1353
01:51:15,397 --> 01:51:19,160
[SPEAKER_16]: I would give it a nine.

1354
01:51:20,320 --> 01:51:20,581
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1355
01:51:21,181 --> 01:51:23,243
[SPEAKER_16]: Because it's pretty funny.

1356
01:51:23,623 --> 01:51:27,046
[SPEAKER_16]: I've never seen Team America because I don't know.

1357
01:51:27,106 --> 01:51:28,427
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not as funny as South Park.

1358
01:51:29,848 --> 01:51:35,932
[SPEAKER_16]: I never got into South Park until this year, so if it's that kind of humor, I may like it.

1359
01:51:36,252 --> 01:51:37,333
[SPEAKER_16]: But that song was great.

1360
01:51:38,774 --> 01:51:40,075
[SPEAKER_16]: Loki, your thoughts?

1361
01:51:41,596 --> 01:51:45,899
[SPEAKER_25]: It started off as a 5, but it became a 9 because it gradually got better over time.

1362
01:51:46,840 --> 01:51:48,201
[SPEAKER_02]: That's good.

1363
01:51:48,281 --> 01:51:49,442
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a montage, yeah, I get it.

1364
01:51:50,863 --> 01:51:55,947
[SPEAKER_02]: My thoughts is that, damn, between your song and my song, we're practically handing Loki another victory tonight.

1365
01:51:57,977 --> 01:51:59,919
[SPEAKER_17]: Are we going to need a montage for this?

1366
01:51:59,939 --> 01:52:01,761
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait until you fucking see what I picked, alright?

1367
01:52:01,801 --> 01:52:03,623
[SPEAKER_17]: But anyway... Do I need to go hide?

1368
01:52:03,703 --> 01:52:05,925
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought I was bad tonight, but this was pretty bad.

1369
01:52:06,967 --> 01:52:08,568
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, funny enough, I picked a montage.

1370
01:52:08,608 --> 01:52:09,509
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I didn't.

1371
01:52:09,809 --> 01:52:10,170
[SPEAKER_02]: That was...

1372
01:52:11,195 --> 01:52:11,655
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

1373
01:52:12,075 --> 01:52:14,756
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funny, but I don't think people are going to vote for it.

1374
01:52:14,816 --> 01:52:15,376
[SPEAKER_02]: I really don't.

1375
01:52:15,696 --> 01:52:17,776
[SPEAKER_02]: But it gets a 7 because it is a pretty funny parody.

1376
01:52:18,116 --> 01:52:22,077
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think the funnier song in Team America World Police was the Everyone Has AIDS song.

1377
01:52:22,617 --> 01:52:30,219
[SPEAKER_17]: I almost picked... Actually, it was a toss-up between the montage, Everyone Has AIDS, and Pearl Harbor Sucks and I Miss You.

1378
01:52:30,499 --> 01:52:33,959
[SPEAKER_16]: Even... There's a song called Everyone Has AIDS?

1379
01:52:34,079 --> 01:52:36,900
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they're parodying Rent in it.

1380
01:52:37,280 --> 01:52:37,400
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh.

1381
01:52:38,030 --> 01:52:38,490
[SPEAKER_02]: Abba!

1382
01:52:59,997 --> 01:53:06,161
[SPEAKER_02]: This is definitely one of those guilty pleasure things, and there really is no excuse for me liking this song at all.

1383
01:53:06,581 --> 01:53:10,723
[SPEAKER_02]: And I apologize in advance, but I'll be damned if this isn't just a damn fun song.

1384
01:53:11,204 --> 01:53:17,867
[SPEAKER_02]: So my pick for tonight's Cage Mass is a brand new song by everyone's favorite lesbians on the planet, Tattoo.

1385
01:53:18,428 --> 01:53:20,289
[SPEAKER_02]: This is their new single, All About Us.

1386
01:56:30,709 --> 01:56:34,290
[SPEAKER_02]: Song number three in tonight's cage match, Tattoo with All About Us.

1387
01:56:35,310 --> 01:56:36,991
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see what you guys thought about that one.

1388
01:56:37,671 --> 01:56:38,491
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.

1389
01:56:39,871 --> 01:56:39,951
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

1390
01:56:43,823 --> 01:57:13,509
[SPEAKER_16]: um actually I can't I couldn't hear because I could hear myself too loudly um it was repetitive and it sounded like everything else I've ever heard them do so it gets a 5 extifer it's um not a very good song it is very stupid I don't like them I don't like tattoo I want to get a tattoo but I don't like tattoo and uh but the the guy getting shot is pretty cool

1391
01:57:14,537 --> 01:57:15,518
[SPEAKER_16]: But he should have raped her.

1392
01:57:15,598 --> 01:57:16,079
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sorry.

1393
01:57:16,179 --> 01:57:20,183
[SPEAKER_02]: He should have raped her because... Scale of 1 to 10 before the angry emo come in.

1394
01:57:20,223 --> 01:57:20,443
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, okay.

1395
01:57:20,684 --> 01:57:21,304
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, um, 2.

1396
01:57:23,327 --> 01:57:23,667
[SPEAKER_16]: Loki.

1397
01:57:24,468 --> 01:57:28,072
[SPEAKER_25]: You know, it would have gotten a higher score with me, but I just didn't really know what the song was about.

1398
01:57:28,592 --> 01:57:30,394
[SPEAKER_25]: So, um, it's getting... It's not about them.

1399
01:57:31,896 --> 01:57:33,137
[SPEAKER_25]: I thought it... Okay, well.

1400
01:57:33,838 --> 01:57:35,179
[SPEAKER_25]: Um, it gets a 7.

1401
01:57:36,843 --> 01:57:38,784
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, Loki actually gave it a higher score than everybody else.

1402
01:57:38,804 --> 01:57:39,384
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm kind of surprised.

1403
01:57:39,964 --> 01:57:40,584
[SPEAKER_02]: I give that song a 10.

1404
01:57:41,184 --> 01:57:42,365
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, Tattoo is awesome.

1405
01:57:42,525 --> 01:57:43,025
[SPEAKER_02]: It's awesome.

1406
01:57:43,245 --> 01:57:43,965
[SPEAKER_02]: They're so awesome.

1407
01:57:44,025 --> 01:57:46,166
[SPEAKER_02]: And the guy gets shot in the video and blood goes everywhere.

1408
01:57:46,226 --> 01:57:46,886
[SPEAKER_02]: It's badass.

1409
01:57:47,626 --> 01:57:47,926
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

1410
01:57:48,827 --> 01:57:49,647
[SPEAKER_02]: She should have been raped.

1411
01:57:50,387 --> 01:57:50,747
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

1412
01:57:51,148 --> 01:57:52,388
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just what Russians do.

1413
01:57:53,108 --> 01:57:54,509
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, song number one.

1414
01:57:54,609 --> 01:57:56,709
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's recap the three songs you can vote for tonight.

1415
01:57:56,749 --> 01:57:58,950
[SPEAKER_02]: Song number one, Doresia with Vee.

1416
01:58:06,843 --> 01:58:09,285
[SPEAKER_02]: Song number two you can vote for tonight, Montage.

1417
01:58:18,431 --> 01:58:22,454
[SPEAKER_02]: And song number three you can vote for tonight is Tattoo with All About Us.

1418
01:58:33,906 --> 01:58:34,326
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1419
01:58:34,506 --> 01:58:36,647
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I had to choose the best lyric from the song there.

1420
01:58:36,987 --> 01:58:39,788
[SPEAKER_02]: You two weren't singing all about us in it.

1421
01:58:40,048 --> 01:58:40,529
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, anyway.

1422
01:58:41,409 --> 01:58:41,829
[SPEAKER_02]: So there it is.

1423
01:58:41,909 --> 01:58:43,470
[SPEAKER_02]: Place vote now, kids.

1424
01:58:43,510 --> 01:58:51,553
[SPEAKER_02]: Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote for song number one, song number two, or, if you so choose, song number three.

1425
01:58:52,933 --> 01:58:57,155
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, this is the part of the show where we go over to Loki and ask what's going on in the sim scene.

1426
01:58:57,235 --> 01:58:59,256
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Loki, what's going on in the sim scene?

1427
01:58:59,496 --> 01:58:59,776
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing.

1428
01:59:00,916 --> 01:59:01,856
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a damn thing, huh?

1429
01:59:02,437 --> 01:59:03,177
[SPEAKER_25]: Nothing important.

1430
01:59:04,417 --> 01:59:04,717
[SPEAKER_25]: Sorry.

1431
01:59:05,918 --> 01:59:07,660
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, actually, I guess one small thing.

1432
01:59:08,020 --> 01:59:14,565
[SPEAKER_25]: Someone put up a conceptual artwork for what will be Step Mania 4.

1433
01:59:14,725 --> 01:59:16,707
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it will be Step Mania 4?

1434
01:59:16,827 --> 01:59:17,568
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, someday.

1435
01:59:20,090 --> 01:59:20,790
[SPEAKER_25]: And it looks cool.

1436
01:59:21,671 --> 01:59:24,994
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, it looks cool.

1437
01:59:25,754 --> 01:59:27,056
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't really know how to describe it.

1438
01:59:27,076 --> 01:59:29,578
[SPEAKER_25]: It's just going to be the same damn thing with another skin on it.

1439
01:59:29,658 --> 01:59:31,499
[SPEAKER_25]: But it'll be cool.

1440
01:59:32,280 --> 01:59:32,500
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1441
01:59:35,565 --> 01:59:35,825
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah.

1442
01:59:36,888 --> 01:59:37,129
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1443
01:59:37,449 --> 01:59:39,073
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, so much for what's going on in The Simpsons, I guess.

1444
01:59:39,093 --> 01:59:41,620
[SPEAKER_25]: I did see, though, there was a new music game coming out on the PSP.

1445
01:59:44,723 --> 01:59:46,264
[SPEAKER_25]: as much of a music game as Rez was.

1446
01:59:46,284 --> 01:59:49,065
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't we talk about that on a podcast like four weeks ago or something?

1447
01:59:49,125 --> 01:59:49,625
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard about it.

1448
01:59:49,645 --> 01:59:51,386
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't seen much more about it.

1449
01:59:51,806 --> 01:59:51,866
[SPEAKER_02]: E3?

1450
01:59:52,066 --> 01:59:52,347
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1451
01:59:52,567 --> 01:59:54,367
[SPEAKER_02]: No, not E3, but a Tokyo game show.

1452
01:59:54,387 --> 01:59:54,888
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1453
01:59:55,068 --> 01:59:56,308
[SPEAKER_02]: The game's called E3.

1454
01:59:56,568 --> 01:59:56,969
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's right.

1455
01:59:56,989 --> 01:59:57,689
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

1456
01:59:57,709 --> 01:59:58,469
[SPEAKER_25]: The game's called E3.

1457
01:59:58,509 --> 01:59:58,969
[SPEAKER_25]: I remember now.

1458
01:59:59,330 --> 02:00:00,130
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1459
02:00:00,150 --> 02:00:02,571
[SPEAKER_02]: Has screenshots come out of this yet or something?

1460
02:00:02,611 --> 02:00:07,833
[SPEAKER_25]: No, I watched the Tokyo game special on G4 and they showed... That was one of their focuses.

1461
02:00:07,853 --> 02:00:08,594
[SPEAKER_25]: They were showing that game.

1462
02:00:08,934 --> 02:00:09,534
[SPEAKER_25]: Looks interesting.

1463
02:00:09,554 --> 02:00:13,136
[SPEAKER_25]: It's like a first... It's like a shooter game, but it's not...

1464
02:00:14,304 --> 02:00:16,006
[SPEAKER_25]: I thought G4 was Spike TV for kids now

1465
02:00:26,312 --> 02:00:41,164
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, they have their moments, but this, they actually had, you know, the two people from X-Play, Kevin Morgan, or Adam Morgan, and then they had that Kevin guy from Attack of the Show.

1466
02:00:41,604 --> 02:00:44,987
[SPEAKER_25]: The smartest people on the network to cover Tokyo Game Show.

1467
02:00:45,067 --> 02:00:50,311
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank God they, like, said whoever else that they have there that's really retarded.

1468
02:00:50,851 --> 02:00:54,354
[SPEAKER_25]: But they got the smart people, and they covered it pretty well, and...

1469
02:00:54,773 --> 02:01:00,176
[SPEAKER_25]: They kind of went more in depth with the Nintendo Revolution stuff and just everything.

1470
02:01:00,676 --> 02:01:01,217
[SPEAKER_25]: But it looked cool.

1471
02:01:01,857 --> 02:01:02,297
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds cool.

1472
02:01:03,018 --> 02:01:05,359
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, if I could just show Jamie something real quick.

1473
02:01:05,419 --> 02:01:07,360
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to make sure Jamie got a chance to see this.

1474
02:01:07,961 --> 02:01:08,501
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a gun.

1475
02:01:08,601 --> 02:01:09,842
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it's a gun.

1476
02:01:10,102 --> 02:01:12,323
[SPEAKER_02]: This is something we were talking about just a second ago, if you don't mind.

1477
02:01:12,343 --> 02:01:14,144
[SPEAKER_17]: I need a gun to keep myself from harm.

1478
02:01:14,204 --> 02:01:19,007
[SPEAKER_02]: I realize this is a radio show, but those of you that have seen this music video will know exactly what I'm talking about right here.

1479
02:01:24,308 --> 02:01:26,270
[SPEAKER_02]: And here we go, and bam!

1480
02:01:26,690 --> 02:01:27,371
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool!

1481
02:01:28,151 --> 02:01:28,632
[SPEAKER_02]: Blood!

1482
02:01:30,953 --> 02:01:32,254
[SPEAKER_16]: It looks kind of like jelly.

1483
02:01:34,596 --> 02:01:35,897
[SPEAKER_16]: Like, it's making me hungry.

1484
02:01:35,917 --> 02:01:37,318
[SPEAKER_16]: I need to get something to eat.

1485
02:01:41,041 --> 02:01:43,102
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, does that change your score any?

1486
02:01:43,322 --> 02:01:45,004
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just curious if that would alter your score.

1487
02:01:45,184 --> 02:01:45,524
[SPEAKER_17]: Four.

1488
02:01:45,884 --> 02:01:46,204
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

1489
02:01:46,865 --> 02:01:49,027
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait a minute, didn't you give it a higher score before that?

1490
02:01:49,807 --> 02:01:51,949
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, but now that I've had time to think about the song...

1491
02:01:53,744 --> 02:01:54,644
[SPEAKER_17]: It needs a montage.

1492
02:01:55,204 --> 02:01:55,504
[SPEAKER_23]: Bitch.

1493
02:01:55,945 --> 02:01:56,305
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright.

1494
02:01:57,245 --> 02:02:03,546
[SPEAKER_17]: So... Loki?

1495
02:02:03,726 --> 02:02:04,846
[SPEAKER_25]: We have to save it, don't we?

1496
02:02:04,986 --> 02:02:05,846
[SPEAKER_25]: We have to save that.

1497
02:02:07,587 --> 02:02:11,067
[SPEAKER_02]: Fine.

1498
02:02:11,247 --> 02:02:11,707
[SPEAKER_02]: Give him a hint.

1499
02:02:12,107 --> 02:02:12,767
[SPEAKER_02]: Give him a little hint.

1500
02:02:12,787 --> 02:02:13,568
[SPEAKER_02]: You can drop a little hint.

1501
02:02:15,828 --> 02:02:18,068
[SPEAKER_02]: We... made a new webpage.

1502
02:02:19,589 --> 02:02:19,829
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

1503
02:02:20,549 --> 02:02:20,769
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

1504
02:02:20,989 --> 02:02:21,309
[SPEAKER_22]: That's good.

1505
02:02:21,389 --> 02:02:21,809
[SPEAKER_22]: That's a good hint.

1506
02:02:23,476 --> 02:02:24,036
[SPEAKER_22]: It's new!

1507
02:02:24,617 --> 02:02:25,858
[SPEAKER_02]: It's new, exactly.

1508
02:02:27,519 --> 02:02:28,620
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's a webpage.

1509
02:02:48,065 --> 02:02:48,946
[SPEAKER_25]: You know what I haven't done yet?

1510
02:02:49,066 --> 02:02:49,286
[SPEAKER_25]: What?

1511
02:02:49,446 --> 02:02:50,147
[SPEAKER_25]: What I need to do?

1512
02:02:50,987 --> 02:02:57,832
[SPEAKER_25]: I didn't have time during the week, but I need to pop in the DDR Extreme 2 DVD to find the track list.

1513
02:02:58,473 --> 02:03:00,334
[SPEAKER_25]: I think some folks already did that over on DR3.

1514
02:03:01,035 --> 02:03:01,635
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember them.

1515
02:03:02,456 --> 02:03:05,538
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they found it already.

1516
02:03:06,419 --> 02:03:09,241
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's not... There's nothing really in there, from what I remember.

1517
02:03:09,361 --> 02:03:09,541
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh-huh.

1518
02:03:10,752 --> 02:03:11,954
[SPEAKER_02]: What was the other thing I didn't want to point out?

1519
02:03:11,994 --> 02:03:13,517
[SPEAKER_02]: Did we talk about Downgrader?

1520
02:03:13,777 --> 02:03:15,179
[SPEAKER_02]: PSP firmware?

1521
02:03:16,041 --> 02:03:16,862
[SPEAKER_02]: No, not yet.

1522
02:03:17,423 --> 02:03:19,647
[SPEAKER_02]: I seem like we talked about that on the podcast, didn't we?

1523
02:03:19,972 --> 02:03:21,812
[SPEAKER_25]: No, it didn't happen until this week.

1524
02:03:21,832 --> 02:03:23,353
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, the actual downgrade didn't happen.

1525
02:03:23,413 --> 02:03:30,314
[SPEAKER_02]: We talked about on the podcast the fact that 2.0 had been exploited, but we hadn't talked about the downgrader yet.

1526
02:03:30,354 --> 02:03:33,055
[SPEAKER_02]: So what does this mean for hackers on the PSP?

1527
02:03:33,195 --> 02:03:39,696
[SPEAKER_25]: It means if you bought one that happened to be firmware 1.51 or 1.52 or 2.0, you can actually downgrade it back to 1.5.

1528
02:03:45,037 --> 02:03:54,761
[SPEAKER_25]: And the way you do that is you run this bit of homebrew code using an exploit in their image, their photo gallery thing.

1529
02:03:55,061 --> 02:03:59,262
[SPEAKER_25]: It basically is a buffer overflow which allows you to run your own code.

1530
02:03:59,843 --> 02:04:03,904
[SPEAKER_25]: And what that does is the program makes your PSP think it's a version 1.0.

1531
02:04:04,785 --> 02:04:07,506
[SPEAKER_25]: So then what you do is then you throw in the version 1.5 update.

1532
02:04:08,988 --> 02:04:12,791
[SPEAKER_25]: that came out a while ago for the Japanese, and you run the update.

1533
02:04:12,831 --> 02:04:24,799
[SPEAKER_25]: And what'll happen is it'll crash out at the very end because it realizes, hey, wait a second, this isn't, you know, version 1 PSP, but then you just kind of reset it a few times and you're back at version 1.5.

1534
02:04:24,999 --> 02:04:33,885
[SPEAKER_25]: Problem is, is because it's only a 99% install, we don't know what kind of repercussions that will have later on.

1535
02:04:34,842 --> 02:04:39,645
[SPEAKER_25]: I've heard things from people couldn't get their web browser working again to other stuff.

1536
02:04:39,665 --> 02:04:50,772
[SPEAKER_25]: But then again, I don't know if that's just people spreading rumors or what, but people have downgraded, upgraded, downgraded, upgraded, so you can do it, and so you have the best of both worlds.

1537
02:04:51,593 --> 02:04:58,257
[SPEAKER_25]: On the other hand, I thought about selling my other PSP to downgrade it, or downgrade one and sell it, just to get some more money.

1538
02:04:58,337 --> 02:05:01,119
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm actually going to keep both because I don't know how...

1539
02:05:02,426 --> 02:05:10,110
[SPEAKER_25]: obviously they're working on version 2.5 which is going to come out soon so gotta keep one for that stuff and one for the homebrew stuff keeping one at 1.5

1540
02:05:13,953 --> 02:05:15,114
[SPEAKER_02]: Dokkan no Naka no Mozart

1541
02:05:44,079 --> 02:05:48,103
[SPEAKER_02]: and Hoppin' Choppin' we're going to play and Mario No Carnival.

1542
02:05:48,183 --> 02:05:54,288
[SPEAKER_25]: They really need to put the Para Para Dancers with that commercial that they had for Mario in the U.S.

1543
02:05:54,329 --> 02:05:54,649
[SPEAKER_25]: commercials.

1544
02:05:54,689 --> 02:05:55,510
[SPEAKER_25]: I think that would be great.

1545
02:05:55,790 --> 02:05:56,150
[SPEAKER_25]: We'll see.

1546
02:05:56,230 --> 02:05:56,511
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

1547
02:05:56,811 --> 02:06:02,716
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to come back after this a break of music from DDR with Mario so you guys can check this out and we'll be back with more Orange Launch Radio.

1548
02:06:03,737 --> 02:06:04,678
Orange Launch Radio

1549
02:07:10,121 --> 02:07:10,569
Thanks for watching!

1550
02:08:37,131 --> 02:08:38,012
Thanks for watching!

1551
02:09:39,657 --> 02:09:40,438
Thanks for watching!

1552
02:10:23,980 --> 02:10:25,180
Mario's The Superstar

1553
02:11:33,877 --> 02:11:35,058
Mario the Superstar

1554
02:12:21,904 --> 02:12:22,687
[SPEAKER_18]: and Superstar!

1555
02:12:31,946 --> 02:12:40,593
[SPEAKER_01]: Hiho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter V, the letter A, and the number 59.

1556
02:12:46,298 --> 02:12:49,120
[SPEAKER_02]: Sup kids, we're back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1557
02:12:49,160 --> 02:12:51,402
[SPEAKER_02]: That was some music from DDR with Mario.

1558
02:12:51,522 --> 02:12:55,865
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go, the Mozart one, Hoppin' Choppin', Carnival, etc.

1559
02:12:55,906 --> 02:12:57,307
[SPEAKER_02]: What did you think of DDR with Mario?

1560
02:12:57,327 --> 02:12:58,808
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the first time some of you guys are hearing that music.

1561
02:12:59,651 --> 02:13:03,254
[SPEAKER_17]: It's incredibly happy and makes me so happy I could puke.

1562
02:13:03,454 --> 02:13:06,797
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that made me so happy that I think I pooped my pants because it lost controls in my bowel.

1563
02:13:06,897 --> 02:13:08,638
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't need medication anymore.

1564
02:13:09,759 --> 02:13:10,240
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1565
02:13:10,540 --> 02:13:11,340
[SPEAKER_16]: Use Effexor?

1566
02:13:11,701 --> 02:13:12,101
[SPEAKER_16]: No!

1567
02:13:12,982 --> 02:13:14,763
[SPEAKER_16]: Just listen to Mario DDR.

1568
02:13:16,364 --> 02:13:18,546
[SPEAKER_25]: I heard Ice Clamor sound effects in there.

1569
02:13:18,646 --> 02:13:19,106
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, you did.

1570
02:13:19,707 --> 02:13:21,148
[SPEAKER_02]: The typical Nintendo traits.

1571
02:13:21,528 --> 02:13:22,129
[SPEAKER_25]: And, um...

1572
02:13:23,576 --> 02:13:25,398
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, I know why we don't play that anymore.

1573
02:13:25,558 --> 02:13:26,278
[SPEAKER_25]: No, it was cute.

1574
02:13:26,378 --> 02:13:27,479
[SPEAKER_25]: I thought some of it was cute.

1575
02:13:27,579 --> 02:13:29,420
[SPEAKER_25]: Like, Hoppin' Choppin' was a cute song, I thought.

1576
02:13:29,561 --> 02:13:30,862
[SPEAKER_25]: You know what that game needs?

1577
02:13:30,942 --> 02:13:31,122
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1578
02:13:31,142 --> 02:13:33,503
[SPEAKER_25]: A lot of seizure-inducing strobing.

1579
02:13:33,523 --> 02:13:33,944
[SPEAKER_02]: It should have.

1580
02:13:34,244 --> 02:13:39,468
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what's funny is that you'd think I would have heard that music at E3 when I actually got to play DDR with Mario, but I really didn't.

1581
02:13:39,728 --> 02:13:44,231
[SPEAKER_02]: But the funny thing is, to put in perspective how difficult DDR with Mario is, I AAA'd the song I played.

1582
02:13:44,251 --> 02:13:46,433
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the first time I ever played it.

1583
02:13:48,105 --> 02:13:51,948
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not this, I don't profess to be some type of DDR king, okay?

1584
02:13:52,028 --> 02:13:53,048
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I'm not that great.

1585
02:13:53,068 --> 02:13:53,409
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, you do.

1586
02:13:53,869 --> 02:13:54,329
[SPEAKER_02]: I do not.

1587
02:13:55,310 --> 02:14:01,494
[SPEAKER_02]: My cousin, Dr. D, does, but I do not profess to be some type of DDR god.

1588
02:14:03,015 --> 02:14:05,476
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, do you kids want to hear who won tonight's cage match?

1589
02:14:05,516 --> 02:14:06,157
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet you do.

1590
02:14:06,577 --> 02:14:07,158
[SPEAKER_17]: Why not?

1591
02:14:08,378 --> 02:14:10,600
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's hear the results in a montage.

1592
02:14:12,321 --> 02:14:16,964
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, you could probably spell out the results in a V formation.

1593
02:14:19,028 --> 02:14:20,489
[SPEAKER_17]: That song gives me such a headache.

1594
02:14:21,389 --> 02:14:22,210
[SPEAKER_02]: That's tonight's winner.

1595
02:14:22,750 --> 02:14:26,252
[SPEAKER_02]: The other two songs not performing quite as badly as I anticipated, actually.

1596
02:14:26,352 --> 02:14:27,832
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was actually kind of close.

1597
02:14:28,052 --> 02:14:29,633
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was kind of surprised.

1598
02:14:30,514 --> 02:14:31,434
[SPEAKER_02]: Extover, you've got a mic?

1599
02:14:31,714 --> 02:14:31,894
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1600
02:14:32,355 --> 02:14:34,095
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, I was just thinking.

1601
02:14:35,936 --> 02:14:37,357
[SPEAKER_16]: Is everybody in the chat room straight?

1602
02:14:37,417 --> 02:14:38,938
[SPEAKER_16]: Because V is like for vagina.

1603
02:14:39,798 --> 02:14:41,599
[SPEAKER_16]: Like, does everybody just like this song that much?

1604
02:14:41,719 --> 02:14:45,261
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think just like the real world...

1605
02:14:45,748 --> 02:15:09,806
[SPEAKER_02]: There's probably some straight people and some gay people and some I don't know what the hell they are people in our chat room I don't really take the time to ask, you know, I don't go around everybody Let's take a poll I don't want to take a poll No, take a poll, you don't want to take a poll, you're gay I don't care You like taking polls Yeah, I don't want this to turn into ASL chat, okay

1606
02:15:10,416 --> 02:15:12,736
[SPEAKER_02]: or ASLS, you know, sexuality or whatever.

1607
02:15:12,776 --> 02:15:13,077
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1608
02:15:13,497 --> 02:15:14,037
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care.

1609
02:15:14,337 --> 02:15:15,597
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm here to talk about games.

1610
02:15:15,637 --> 02:15:16,517
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care who's gay.

1611
02:15:18,137 --> 02:15:18,678
[SPEAKER_17]: No, no, no.

1612
02:15:18,718 --> 02:15:23,278
[SPEAKER_17]: We will know how many of our listeners are gay next week when I put ABBA in.

1613
02:15:23,758 --> 02:15:26,599
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, also, any of you that voted for Tattoo are obviously gay.

1614
02:15:26,639 --> 02:15:26,999
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm kidding.

1615
02:15:27,059 --> 02:15:27,359
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm kidding.

1616
02:15:27,379 --> 02:15:27,979
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so kidding.

1617
02:15:27,999 --> 02:15:28,799
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not true.

1618
02:15:29,880 --> 02:15:32,320
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's not true because I know who voted for Tattoo.

1619
02:15:32,380 --> 02:15:33,060
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just teasing.

1620
02:15:33,600 --> 02:15:36,881
[SPEAKER_16]: Just, you know, let me know if you're a porn loving motherfucker.

1621
02:15:36,941 --> 02:15:37,101
[SPEAKER_16]: Just...

1622
02:15:37,994 --> 02:15:38,495
[SPEAKER_16]: Tell me.

1623
02:15:38,795 --> 02:15:39,756
[SPEAKER_17]: You made Roz cry.

1624
02:15:39,896 --> 02:15:41,017
[SPEAKER_17]: She just wanted me to say that.

1625
02:15:41,798 --> 02:15:42,038
[SPEAKER_16]: Why?

1626
02:15:42,719 --> 02:15:43,740
[SPEAKER_17]: Because you made her cry.

1627
02:15:44,420 --> 02:15:44,561
[SPEAKER_17]: Why?

1628
02:15:44,601 --> 02:15:45,021
[SPEAKER_17]: Why did she cry?

1629
02:15:45,061 --> 02:15:45,882
[SPEAKER_17]: The chatroom made her cry.

1630
02:15:46,302 --> 02:15:47,363
[SPEAKER_24]: Who's Roz and why did she cry?

1631
02:15:47,764 --> 02:15:49,665
[SPEAKER_17]: She's one of my friends from the Gorillas board.

1632
02:15:49,906 --> 02:15:50,426
[SPEAKER_24]: Hello, friends.

1633
02:15:50,967 --> 02:15:52,448
[SPEAKER_17]: And the chatroom just made her cry.

1634
02:15:52,608 --> 02:15:52,808
[SPEAKER_24]: Why?

1635
02:15:52,868 --> 02:15:53,609
[SPEAKER_24]: For voting for that one?

1636
02:15:53,649 --> 02:15:53,809
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah.

1637
02:15:55,431 --> 02:15:55,751
[SPEAKER_24]: Sorry.

1638
02:15:56,352 --> 02:15:56,812
[SPEAKER_24]: It happens.

1639
02:15:56,952 --> 02:15:57,233
[SPEAKER_24]: Sorry.

1640
02:15:57,253 --> 02:15:59,775
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know what to tell you.

1641
02:15:59,815 --> 02:16:00,636
[SPEAKER_25]: The tribe has spoken.

1642
02:16:01,539 --> 02:16:03,900
[SPEAKER_17]: I think she should come in the chat room and bitch everybody out for me.

1643
02:16:03,940 --> 02:16:04,501
[SPEAKER_25]: Go for it.

1644
02:16:05,421 --> 02:16:10,004
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, this is completely on a tangent, but since, you know, we're not going anywhere right now.

1645
02:16:11,484 --> 02:16:14,266
[SPEAKER_25]: You said friends, and that made me think of the Friends game.

1646
02:16:14,366 --> 02:16:20,289
[SPEAKER_25]: I got to watch a video of the Friends game, and let me just say, I wouldn't wish the Friends game on my worst enemies.

1647
02:16:20,949 --> 02:16:24,611
[SPEAKER_25]: I watched a good eight-minute video of this thing, and I wanted to fall asleep.

1648
02:16:24,752 --> 02:16:27,573
[SPEAKER_25]: I didn't even want to play the game after watching the game.

1649
02:16:27,633 --> 02:16:29,294
[SPEAKER_25]: It's just that awful.

1650
02:16:30,503 --> 02:16:32,704
[SPEAKER_25]: Is this another game that we need to get a copy of and autograph?

1651
02:16:33,685 --> 02:16:34,445
[SPEAKER_25]: It is bad.

1652
02:16:34,705 --> 02:16:35,826
[SPEAKER_25]: It is really bad.

1653
02:16:36,006 --> 02:16:38,527
[SPEAKER_25]: It's Friends, the one with all the trivia.

1654
02:16:38,688 --> 02:16:45,191
[SPEAKER_25]: It is narrated by the woman that does Janice on the show, the Fran Drescher wannabe.

1655
02:16:45,971 --> 02:16:47,392
[SPEAKER_25]: Hi!

1656
02:16:48,233 --> 02:16:54,036
[SPEAKER_25]: And it's completely bland, and it just shows a bunch of clips from the show, and the trivia is just lame.

1657
02:16:55,396 --> 02:16:57,057
[SPEAKER_25]: I just want to fall asleep.

1658
02:16:57,497 --> 02:16:58,418
[SPEAKER_25]: I can't watch this anymore.

1659
02:17:04,465 --> 02:17:05,766
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's a Friends game.

1660
02:17:05,786 --> 02:17:07,167
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you got the memo.

1661
02:17:07,307 --> 02:17:09,988
[SPEAKER_16]: Does it have... Wait, this is the TV show Friends, right?

1662
02:17:10,228 --> 02:17:10,889
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, like the TV show.

1663
02:17:10,909 --> 02:17:11,869
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's a video game Friends.

1664
02:17:12,850 --> 02:17:12,970
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh.

1665
02:17:13,991 --> 02:17:17,413
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, I think that that is stupid.

1666
02:17:24,697 --> 02:17:25,697
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, okay, we'll get to that.

1667
02:17:25,757 --> 02:17:26,318
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's do...

1668
02:17:27,366 --> 02:17:32,411
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to get into a segment that we're trying to make a regular segment on this show.

1669
02:17:33,112 --> 02:17:35,635
[SPEAKER_17]: Or irregular, depending on what you have for dinner.

1670
02:17:37,937 --> 02:17:41,161
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm trying to find the background music here.

1671
02:17:41,501 --> 02:17:41,902
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, there we go.

1672
02:17:41,942 --> 02:17:42,222
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.

1673
02:17:43,103 --> 02:17:44,264
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to... Oh, shit.

1674
02:17:44,324 --> 02:17:45,065
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's the wrong track.

1675
02:17:46,906 --> 02:17:47,306
[SPEAKER_02]: Big Boobies No. 1

1676
02:18:15,262 --> 02:18:16,683
[SPEAKER_02]: Big Boobies No.

1677
02:18:16,703 --> 02:18:37,554
[SPEAKER_02]: 2, Big Boobies with Cocks in Them, Blood Spattered Boobies, Boobies and Sunflowers, Boobies for Milking, Boobies in Pee, Mastectomy Leftover Boobies, Hot Hairy Saggy Man Boobies, and then my last, my favorite here, Women in Roller Skates Peeing in Glass Bowls.

1678
02:18:39,214 --> 02:18:40,035
[SPEAKER_02]: What the hell?

1679
02:18:41,249 --> 02:18:42,350
[SPEAKER_24]: Why did you do that?

1680
02:18:42,370 --> 02:18:46,692
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not gonna, you know, if you're gonna download that shit, I mean, don't blame it on me.

1681
02:18:47,212 --> 02:18:50,173
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, this is from the person that left us with the bleached asshole joke.

1682
02:18:52,434 --> 02:18:55,195
[SPEAKER_16]: By the way, um... Did they use something other than bleach?

1683
02:18:55,475 --> 02:18:57,556
[SPEAKER_16]: Did I talk about the asshole strips yet?

1684
02:18:58,157 --> 02:18:58,377
[SPEAKER_16]: No.

1685
02:18:59,177 --> 02:19:00,838
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, well, you know how you have, like...

1686
02:19:01,277 --> 02:19:03,959
[SPEAKER_16]: What about the kind that are supposed to dissolve when you go?

1687
02:19:03,979 --> 02:19:04,339
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm disgusted.

1688
02:19:04,399 --> 02:19:04,939
[SPEAKER_16]: I am so disgusted.

1689
02:19:04,979 --> 02:19:05,600
[SPEAKER_16]: Remember, mint scattles.

1690
02:19:05,620 --> 02:19:06,280
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1691
02:19:26,514 --> 02:19:28,935
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, we're going to just get into this here.

1692
02:19:30,075 --> 02:19:32,276
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to get into a new segment here on the show.

1693
02:19:32,996 --> 02:19:34,737
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's actually a returning segment, really.

1694
02:19:35,017 --> 02:19:36,217
[SPEAKER_02]: We're trying to make this a regular segment.

1695
02:19:36,557 --> 02:19:39,418
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Extraverse Movie Review, boys and girls.

1696
02:19:43,540 --> 02:19:44,760
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, that's gay.

1697
02:19:45,360 --> 02:19:46,341
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly, just like you.

1698
02:19:46,881 --> 02:19:50,102
[SPEAKER_16]: So, Extraverse, what movie are you going to review today?

1699
02:19:50,122 --> 02:19:50,202
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1700
02:19:51,095 --> 02:19:52,435
[SPEAKER_16]: The Long Kiss Goodnight.

1701
02:19:52,576 --> 02:19:53,736
[SPEAKER_16]: The Long Kiss Goodnight.

1702
02:19:54,096 --> 02:19:55,296
[SPEAKER_16]: This is an old ass movie.

1703
02:19:55,316 --> 02:19:56,557
[SPEAKER_16]: Serenity.

1704
02:19:56,717 --> 02:19:57,437
[SPEAKER_16]: And Serenity.

1705
02:19:58,037 --> 02:20:03,259
[SPEAKER_16]: I've already talked about Serenity, but of course everybody probably knows that I'm a Serenity fan.

1706
02:20:03,779 --> 02:20:04,940
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm a Firefly fan.

1707
02:20:04,980 --> 02:20:07,380
[SPEAKER_16]: What did you think of Serenity on the second viewing this week?

1708
02:20:07,501 --> 02:20:09,681
[SPEAKER_16]: The second viewing was great.

1709
02:20:09,861 --> 02:20:12,202
[SPEAKER_16]: I got to see it with a lot of people and they all liked it.

1710
02:20:12,262 --> 02:20:15,923
[SPEAKER_16]: I was sitting in the straight guy row, so I was an honorary straight guy.

1711
02:20:16,043 --> 02:20:18,864
[SPEAKER_16]: I counted all the girls' boobies and it seems like they all have two.

1712
02:20:19,945 --> 02:20:20,565
[SPEAKER_16]: I also...

1713
02:20:21,622 --> 02:20:22,042
[SPEAKER_17]: Wait, wait, wait.

1714
02:20:22,082 --> 02:20:24,644
[SPEAKER_17]: Does that mean that I was an honorary gay man that night?

1715
02:20:24,844 --> 02:20:25,064
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1716
02:20:26,044 --> 02:20:31,207
[SPEAKER_16]: Jamie was sitting in the gay man row, which you were sitting in.

1717
02:20:31,247 --> 02:20:32,928
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, thank you for reminding our listeners.

1718
02:20:33,128 --> 02:20:33,508
[SPEAKER_16]: No problem.

1719
02:20:34,809 --> 02:20:39,332
[SPEAKER_16]: And I also... Oh, that's so much fun.

1720
02:20:40,072 --> 02:20:44,414
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyways, I just wanted to talk about Serenity more.

1721
02:20:44,474 --> 02:20:49,237
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyways, so Serenity is great, and then the third time I watched it, which was yesterday...

1722
02:20:50,103 --> 02:20:52,066
[SPEAKER_16]: I was enjoying it a lot too.

1723
02:20:52,566 --> 02:21:00,276
[SPEAKER_16]: And my sister like hit me in my arm when something really shocking happened in the movie because she really likes Firefly as well.

1724
02:21:00,757 --> 02:21:01,017
[SPEAKER_16]: Right.

1725
02:21:01,278 --> 02:21:01,979
[SPEAKER_16]: So, but it hurt.

1726
02:21:02,159 --> 02:21:03,681
[SPEAKER_02]: So Serenity on the third viewing.

1727
02:21:03,781 --> 02:21:04,702
[SPEAKER_02]: Thumbs up, thumbs down.

1728
02:21:04,862 --> 02:21:06,585
[SPEAKER_02]: Thumbs fucking up.

1729
02:21:06,925 --> 02:21:07,246
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

1730
02:21:07,586 --> 02:21:08,267
[SPEAKER_02]: Thumbs fucking up.

1731
02:21:08,854 --> 02:21:10,675
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, how about Long Kiss Goodnight?

1732
02:21:10,715 --> 02:21:12,156
[SPEAKER_16]: Now, this movie's like 20 years old.

1733
02:21:12,236 --> 02:21:12,736
[SPEAKER_16]: How old is this?

1734
02:21:12,816 --> 02:21:20,020
[SPEAKER_16]: I loved that movie when I saw it the first time because Geena Davis kicks ass and it's just a cheesy, like, action movie.

1735
02:21:20,500 --> 02:21:28,545
[SPEAKER_16]: But, I mean, I saw it for the first time in years with Garrett, who was on the show last week.

1736
02:21:29,005 --> 02:21:31,126
[SPEAKER_16]: Right, the Poppin' Music Whore is what we call him on the show.

1737
02:21:31,146 --> 02:21:32,047
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, Poppin' Music Whore.

1738
02:21:32,987 --> 02:21:35,809
[SPEAKER_16]: And Poppin' Music Whore and I...

1739
02:21:37,173 --> 02:21:38,534
[SPEAKER_16]: Make fun of it quite a bit.

1740
02:21:38,634 --> 02:21:40,454
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, there are so many cheesy lines.

1741
02:21:40,935 --> 02:21:47,818
[SPEAKER_16]: There's like this line where this guy goes, where Gina Davis says something like, I'm saving myself to get raped.

1742
02:21:48,798 --> 02:21:49,938
[SPEAKER_16]: Like, it's just so random.

1743
02:21:49,978 --> 02:21:53,740
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm like, okay, you know, that was, it was fun.

1744
02:21:53,820 --> 02:21:55,821
[SPEAKER_16]: It was, you know, it's a fun movie or whatever.

1745
02:21:55,841 --> 02:22:00,363
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a little long, but I give it thumbs sideways.

1746
02:22:00,842 --> 02:22:01,142
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

1747
02:22:01,242 --> 02:22:01,923
[SPEAKER_16]: For you.

1748
02:22:02,243 --> 02:22:07,427
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, lastly, you told me that you were going to be reviewing a TV show tonight because you didn't get to really see a new movie in the theater.

1749
02:22:07,447 --> 02:22:08,707
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to review a TV show tonight.

1750
02:22:08,848 --> 02:22:09,108
[SPEAKER_02]: I did?

1751
02:22:09,128 --> 02:22:09,948
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1752
02:22:10,088 --> 02:22:10,929
[SPEAKER_02]: Which TV show?

1753
02:22:13,371 --> 02:22:14,511
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, The Will and Grace.

1754
02:22:14,692 --> 02:22:17,273
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad you prepped for tonight's movie review segment.

1755
02:22:17,734 --> 02:22:18,374
[SPEAKER_16]: Will and Grace.

1756
02:22:19,555 --> 02:22:22,697
[SPEAKER_16]: I'd never gotten to Will and Grace until this year when I moved to Sacramento.

1757
02:22:23,057 --> 02:22:26,840
[SPEAKER_16]: And, like, I think it's pretty damn hilarious.

1758
02:22:27,824 --> 02:22:34,927
[SPEAKER_16]: But they had their live show, which, you know, I was hoping for them to mess up more, but they didn't.

1759
02:22:35,428 --> 02:22:36,828
[SPEAKER_16]: But it was funny anyway.

1760
02:22:37,008 --> 02:22:37,929
[SPEAKER_16]: I had a good time with it.

1761
02:22:38,149 --> 02:22:40,730
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so thumbs up or thumbs down for Will and Drake?

1762
02:22:41,350 --> 02:22:41,690
[SPEAKER_16]: Thumbs up.

1763
02:22:41,710 --> 02:22:42,911
[SPEAKER_16]: Thumbs up.

1764
02:22:43,791 --> 02:22:43,931
[SPEAKER_02]: Up.

1765
02:22:45,292 --> 02:22:46,673
[SPEAKER_02]: This is so boring.

1766
02:22:46,753 --> 02:22:47,133
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

1767
02:22:47,453 --> 02:22:49,094
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Extrofer, for that movie review.

1768
02:22:49,114 --> 02:22:49,914
[SPEAKER_02]: Now get off our show.

1769
02:22:49,954 --> 02:22:50,434
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1770
02:22:51,034 --> 02:22:51,575
[SPEAKER_02]: Get off our show.

1771
02:22:51,855 --> 02:22:52,115
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

1772
02:22:55,369 --> 02:23:01,851
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to get into another segment we love to do here on Orange Lounge Radio every single damn week because you know what?

1773
02:23:05,612 --> 02:23:06,352
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

1774
02:23:07,152 --> 02:23:07,872
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1775
02:23:09,133 --> 02:23:10,853
[SPEAKER_02]: We are full of angst.

1776
02:23:11,253 --> 02:23:12,334
[SPEAKER_02]: I am full of rage.

1777
02:23:12,454 --> 02:23:12,934
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

1778
02:23:12,994 --> 02:23:16,675
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why we have to do the FUs of the week every single week.

1779
02:23:16,735 --> 02:23:18,015
[SPEAKER_02]: And DarkSakura, what's your excuse?

1780
02:23:18,075 --> 02:23:19,976
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do we have to do the FUs of the week every single week?

1781
02:23:21,076 --> 02:23:21,436
[SPEAKER_15]: Balls.

1782
02:23:30,279 --> 02:23:36,361
[SPEAKER_17]: A big F you goes toward my sinus infection that I'm finally over and the fact that I haven't worked out.

1783
02:23:36,781 --> 02:23:40,682
[SPEAKER_17]: An F you goes toward the Adobe company for making Illustrator.

1784
02:23:41,783 --> 02:23:42,963
[SPEAKER_17]: I hate vectors.

1785
02:23:43,683 --> 02:23:50,866
[SPEAKER_17]: You know you've been doing Illustrator homework for too long when you start seeing real life in terms of vectors?

1786
02:23:52,179 --> 02:23:52,880
[SPEAKER_17]: I hate vectors.

1787
02:23:53,560 --> 02:23:54,501
[SPEAKER_17]: I hate them, hate them, hate them.

1788
02:23:55,201 --> 02:23:57,703
[SPEAKER_17]: And I am posting my homework in my chatroom.

1789
02:23:57,743 --> 02:23:59,945
[SPEAKER_17]: I think you're like that one best, which is in a red monotone.

1790
02:24:00,245 --> 02:24:01,866
[SPEAKER_17]: It really is looking like shit.

1791
02:24:04,505 --> 02:24:10,109
[SPEAKER_17]: I also am mad at people in SUVs.

1792
02:24:10,289 --> 02:24:12,270
[SPEAKER_17]: What's that kind of like one, the Escalade?

1793
02:24:12,810 --> 02:24:15,232
[SPEAKER_17]: It looks like it's a fake SUV with a truck ass.

1794
02:24:15,412 --> 02:24:17,413
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like the SUVs that look like a box.

1795
02:24:17,773 --> 02:24:20,655
[SPEAKER_17]: Someone at Sam's Club last night was double parked in one of them.

1796
02:24:21,076 --> 02:24:23,217
[SPEAKER_17]: And I totally made fun of them loudly in the parking lot.

1797
02:24:23,397 --> 02:24:24,218
[SPEAKER_16]: Was it a lesbian?

1798
02:24:24,638 --> 02:24:26,199
[SPEAKER_17]: No, it was some stupid...

1799
02:24:26,957 --> 02:24:35,105
[SPEAKER_17]: I was screaming, hi, I have money, and I have shit for brains and I can't park, and he heard me, and then I drove off.

1800
02:24:35,926 --> 02:24:36,506
[SPEAKER_16]: That's awesome.

1801
02:24:36,807 --> 02:24:39,930
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, I called a lady a cunt one time, because Rob told me to.

1802
02:24:41,311 --> 02:24:42,072
[SPEAKER_16]: Really?

1803
02:24:42,132 --> 02:24:47,917
[SPEAKER_16]: He told me to roll down the window, because some lady cut him off in the parking lot, and he goes, that lady's a cunt.

1804
02:24:48,118 --> 02:24:50,019
[SPEAKER_16]: Christopher, roll down that window and call her a cunt.

1805
02:24:50,220 --> 02:24:51,621
[SPEAKER_16]: Just jokingly, you know, and I'm like,

1806
02:24:52,168 --> 02:24:55,714
[SPEAKER_16]: I looked at him and I looked at everybody else in the car and I said, well, okay.

1807
02:24:55,794 --> 02:24:58,138
[SPEAKER_16]: I rolled down the window and I said, you're a cunt.

1808
02:24:59,440 --> 02:25:02,085
[SPEAKER_16]: And Rob can back me up.

1809
02:25:02,285 --> 02:25:03,106
[SPEAKER_16]: That's beautiful.

1810
02:25:03,247 --> 02:25:04,428
[SPEAKER_16]: He's not making this shit up.

1811
02:25:04,689 --> 02:25:05,310
[SPEAKER_16]: He really isn't.

1812
02:25:06,585 --> 02:25:18,957
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, and Legend of Zaku, you get an F you because I've had my Wacom for a very long fucking time, and I still hate that stupid goddamn program because he made us fucking use the pen tool.

1813
02:25:19,337 --> 02:25:25,483
[SPEAKER_17]: I could have done the whole thing with the drawing tool, but no, we had to do it with the pen tool.

1814
02:25:25,903 --> 02:25:29,586
[SPEAKER_17]: So, don't fucking ever correct me again, you don't have the right.

1815
02:25:33,277 --> 02:25:37,440
[SPEAKER_17]: A second FU goes toward Loki's song because it gives me a headache every time I hear it.

1816
02:25:41,464 --> 02:25:45,807
[SPEAKER_17]: And an FU to gold detailing on cars that really don't need gold detailing.

1817
02:25:49,370 --> 02:25:54,294
[SPEAKER_17]: And also another FU to Legend of Zaku because I was not a math major because it was a waste of my time.

1818
02:25:56,816 --> 02:25:59,739
[SPEAKER_17]: And really...

1819
02:26:02,156 --> 02:26:06,058
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, if he says anything more about what I need, I'm fucking kicking you, okay?

1820
02:26:06,098 --> 02:26:08,320
[SPEAKER_17]: In fact, I'm going to do it anyway just because I fucking feel like it.

1821
02:26:09,480 --> 02:26:10,961
[SPEAKER_17]: You piss me off every time I come here.

1822
02:26:12,062 --> 02:26:12,942
[SPEAKER_17]: Stop pissing me off!

1823
02:26:15,504 --> 02:26:20,306
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, and, uh, FU goes toward, uh, everything else.

1824
02:26:23,988 --> 02:26:25,289
[SPEAKER_16]: Was that it?

1825
02:26:25,549 --> 02:26:26,090
[SPEAKER_17]: That was.

1826
02:26:26,330 --> 02:26:26,670
[SPEAKER_16]: Is that it?

1827
02:26:27,030 --> 02:26:27,330
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

1828
02:26:27,410 --> 02:26:27,991
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, here we go.

1829
02:26:29,091 --> 02:26:30,132
[SPEAKER_16]: Next up, Loki.

1830
02:26:30,152 --> 02:26:30,312
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1831
02:26:33,783 --> 02:26:44,645
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, um, I've really got, like, one major one that I need to get off my chest, and that is, fuck you the fact that I'm potentially have to go to jury duty on Tuesday.

1832
02:26:44,665 --> 02:26:46,605
[SPEAKER_17]: Tell them you're in school.

1833
02:26:47,345 --> 02:26:48,406
[SPEAKER_17]: You'll get out of it until December.

1834
02:26:49,946 --> 02:26:52,686
[SPEAKER_25]: I just don't want to get, I just want to get out of it, period.

1835
02:26:53,066 --> 02:26:55,927
[SPEAKER_25]: So, uh, fuck you that.

1836
02:26:56,367 --> 02:26:58,347
[SPEAKER_25]: Tell them you're incredibly racist and homophobic.

1837
02:26:59,567 --> 02:27:03,028
[SPEAKER_25]: No, I'll just, I'll wait, because I might not even have to go, and if I do,

1838
02:27:03,650 --> 02:27:05,171
[SPEAKER_25]: Um, I'll take care of it.

1839
02:27:05,391 --> 02:27:06,631
[SPEAKER_25]: Whatever I need to do, I'll do.

1840
02:27:06,951 --> 02:27:09,172
[SPEAKER_02]: So, it's your duty, duty.

1841
02:27:11,113 --> 02:27:13,794
[SPEAKER_25]: I just basically made it look like I don't want to be there.

1842
02:27:13,894 --> 02:27:16,035
[SPEAKER_25]: So, you know, if I don't want to be there, I don't want to be there.

1843
02:27:16,175 --> 02:27:17,015
[SPEAKER_25]: So, whatever.

1844
02:27:18,956 --> 02:27:21,036
[SPEAKER_25]: And, um, yeah, pretty much that.

1845
02:27:21,377 --> 02:27:26,138
[SPEAKER_25]: And for some reason, um, I'm having problems with certain things.

1846
02:27:26,839 --> 02:27:28,939
[SPEAKER_25]: A webpage related that pissed me off.

1847
02:27:29,320 --> 02:27:30,540
[SPEAKER_25]: But, um, ah.

1848
02:27:33,174 --> 02:27:34,114
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, I'm done.

1849
02:27:34,234 --> 02:27:35,095
[SPEAKER_25]: That's all I really have.

1850
02:27:40,777 --> 02:27:41,418
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay, my turn then.

1851
02:27:49,881 --> 02:27:56,044
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to give an F you to me for not getting enough sleep at night throughout the week and on the weekend.

1852
02:27:57,345 --> 02:28:00,426
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to give an F you to the fact... Shut the fuck up, Christopher.

1853
02:28:00,914 --> 02:28:13,525
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to give an F you to the fact that I haven't been eating very well all week, but at least I've kind of... Despite my irregular eating patterns, I've actually managed to lose some weight, so I guess I can't complain too much, except, you know, I don't want to, like, kill my liver or anything.

1854
02:28:15,867 --> 02:28:18,129
[SPEAKER_02]: And so an F you to lack of motivation for that.

1855
02:28:18,790 --> 02:28:24,375
[SPEAKER_02]: An F you to other drama that I'm going through professionally right now, but I'll be okay.

1856
02:28:24,775 --> 02:28:25,235
[SPEAKER_02]: And just...

1857
02:28:27,409 --> 02:28:31,671
[SPEAKER_02]: and FU to the fact that I still have work left to do and it's Sunday night and I've got to have it done by tomorrow morning.

1858
02:28:32,451 --> 02:28:32,992
[SPEAKER_02]: Sucks.

1859
02:28:33,412 --> 02:28:36,293
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I guess that's it.

1860
02:28:36,493 --> 02:28:40,735
[SPEAKER_02]: FU to Fandango because it costs like $1.25 to use Fandango.

1861
02:28:40,795 --> 02:28:42,736
[SPEAKER_17]: Did you do the Fandango with your credit card?

1862
02:28:43,036 --> 02:28:43,376
[SPEAKER_02]: I did.

1863
02:28:44,597 --> 02:28:45,537
[SPEAKER_02]: Fandango.

1864
02:28:45,577 --> 02:28:46,137
[SPEAKER_02]: Fandango.

1865
02:28:46,217 --> 02:28:46,898
[SPEAKER_02]: Hobocamp.

1866
02:28:46,958 --> 02:28:47,958
[SPEAKER_02]: Hobocamp.

1867
02:28:48,358 --> 02:28:51,520
[SPEAKER_02]: And come to find out that Serenity wasn't even that crowded.

1868
02:28:51,580 --> 02:28:53,421
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I could have just walked right in and got tickets.

1869
02:28:53,761 --> 02:28:54,061
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought...

1870
02:28:54,889 --> 02:28:57,311
[SPEAKER_02]: Because of all the hype on LJ, I thought that theater was going to be packed.

1871
02:28:57,972 --> 02:29:05,538
[SPEAKER_17]: Actually, I'm sure that the earlier ones were, but I still think it's funny that I woke up late and then made it down the freeway in 15 minutes.

1872
02:29:06,198 --> 02:29:08,120
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, that was crazy.

1873
02:29:09,341 --> 02:29:10,321
[SPEAKER_17]: Things I do for fandom.

1874
02:29:10,782 --> 02:29:13,844
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, let's get to Extover's FUs.

1875
02:29:15,545 --> 02:29:19,008
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, FU to people with unnecessary drama.

1876
02:29:20,229 --> 02:29:21,290
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, um...

1877
02:29:21,846 --> 02:29:22,967
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm so indifferent to you.

1878
02:29:23,247 --> 02:29:23,787
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't care.

1879
02:29:24,228 --> 02:29:26,009
[SPEAKER_16]: Don't bring it and put it in my face.

1880
02:29:26,889 --> 02:29:27,169
[SPEAKER_16]: You know?

1881
02:29:28,890 --> 02:29:34,174
[SPEAKER_16]: But otherwise, a big old fuck you in a good way to everybody I like.

1882
02:29:38,877 --> 02:29:39,937
[SPEAKER_16]: Because it feels good.

1883
02:29:41,258 --> 02:29:41,659
[SPEAKER_16]: Is that it?

1884
02:29:42,219 --> 02:29:44,300
[SPEAKER_16]: A big old anal thrust to everyone.

1885
02:29:44,480 --> 02:29:45,481
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, you're done.

1886
02:29:48,643 --> 02:29:49,804
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's move on to the chatroom, shall we?

[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck my cold and fuck my bad ram.

1891
02:30:11,785 --> 02:30:12,605
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounded dirty.

1892
02:30:13,553 --> 02:30:17,196
[SPEAKER_02]: Sakarina says fuck Life 365 for making me miss the first quarter of the show.

1893
02:30:17,657 --> 02:30:20,459
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck that guy who's been stealing that 12 year old I find cute.

1894
02:30:20,820 --> 02:30:23,302
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck Illustrator because it makes DarkSakura angry.

1895
02:30:23,682 --> 02:30:27,866
[SPEAKER_02]: And fuck Tomokun in a friendly way for interrupting my bisexual erotica reading session.

[SPEAKER_02]: And F you to all USDDR mixes for not having little bitch.

1897
02:30:32,230 --> 02:30:34,092
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I need to get Pump It Up and put it in there.

1898
02:30:36,016 --> 02:30:39,079
[SPEAKER_02]: MPQ says, F you to guys that pretend to be girls on the internet.

1899
02:30:39,359 --> 02:30:41,180
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like a fucking internet cliche.

1900
02:30:41,401 --> 02:30:45,344
[SPEAKER_02]: F you to my router for being a piece of shit and randomly deciding to not let people connect.

1901
02:30:45,904 --> 02:30:49,667
[SPEAKER_02]: F you to Injection of Love Hina Mix for reminding me of Love Hina, which I hate.

1902
02:30:51,269 --> 02:30:55,412
[SPEAKER_02]: Goggle says, F you to Garden Burger for tasting like meatloaf instead of a burger.

1903
02:30:55,552 --> 02:30:56,053
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree.

1904
02:30:56,413 --> 02:30:58,014
[SPEAKER_02]: F you to the awful lag I'm getting.

1905
02:30:58,374 --> 02:31:00,016

02:31:29,910 --> 02:31:33,253
[SPEAKER_02]: Illusion says F you to Family Guy for sucking so much recently.

1915
02:31:33,594 --> 02:31:35,796
[SPEAKER_02]: All it has become is a bunch of lame illusions.

1916
02:31:35,956 --> 02:31:36,416
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh ho ho.

1917
02:31:36,957 --> 02:31:37,497
[SPEAKER_16]: I would agree.

1918
02:31:37,677 --> 02:31:40,640
[SPEAKER_02]: To older episodes that string along the already thin plot.

1919
02:31:40,700 --> 02:31:40,981
[SPEAKER_02]: Lame.

1920
02:31:41,101 --> 02:31:42,442
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree 500%.

1921
02:31:42,502 --> 02:31:43,823
[SPEAKER_02]: Family Guy sucks this year.

1922
02:31:45,385 --> 02:31:46,486
[SPEAKER_02]: Rini says my...

1923
02:31:47,319 --> 02:31:53,461
[SPEAKER_02]: Upmost Ultimate Fuck You goes to Dance Master Mode's mission with Boom Boom Dollar KOG G3 on break.

1924
02:31:53,881 --> 02:31:57,202
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck break like all get out because it's the worst modifier ever.

1925
02:31:57,603 --> 02:32:02,084
[SPEAKER_02]: This fuck ass mission has literally made Dance Master impossible to complete for me.

1926
02:32:02,664 --> 02:32:05,445
[SPEAKER_02]: And everybody, I want you to use fuck ass in a sentence later today.

1927
02:32:05,725 --> 02:32:06,446
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the word of the day.

1928
02:32:07,246 --> 02:32:12,948
[SPEAKER_02]: And fuck anybody who said the Dynamite Rave heavy on reverse on hard because it wasn't and it still wasn't

1929
02:32:13,974 --> 02:32:16,215
[SPEAKER_02]: when you had to not do well on it.

1930
02:32:16,916 --> 02:32:20,518
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, one for Sky because of his hidden bad omen from last week.

1931
02:32:20,538 --> 02:32:25,881
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys may or may not remember, I put a hex on Rini last week because I was mad at him about something.

1932
02:32:25,901 --> 02:32:26,601
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember what now.

1933
02:32:29,761 --> 02:32:54,760
[SPEAKER_02]: Brightsta says F you to gas prices, F you to people who smoke, I'd like to sue you for second hand smoking F you to this asshole who's in our dorm and keeps playing his music really loud F you to the campus store for having such high prices for food F you to my router which XP keeps showing as disconnecting my ethernet cable physically And just an FYI as someone who used to smoke, your anger is not going to make them stop any faster

1934
02:32:55,832 --> 02:33:18,824
[SPEAKER_17]: By the way, as far as the people in dorm rooms that play their music really loudly, what I used to do is I used to, when the people across the hall would play their rap really loudly, because I hate that type of rap, I would turn on my stereo really loud, which was on top of my chest of drawers, and we had cinder block walls, and would crank Vanessa May to the ultimate loudness on Takata and Fugue in D minor.

1935
02:33:19,364 --> 02:33:23,386
[SPEAKER_17]: But you should do that with the organ version, because I guarantee you,

1936
02:33:24,295 --> 02:33:27,557
[SPEAKER_17]: It will chase people off, and you will have the entire building to yourself.

1937
02:33:28,538 --> 02:33:28,958
[SPEAKER_17]: It works!

1938
02:33:29,438 --> 02:33:36,283
[SPEAKER_16]: To the person quitting smoking, um, maybe you should think about, uh, you know, having to fuck ass.

1939
02:33:37,944 --> 02:33:39,164
[SPEAKER_16]: Every single time you want to smoke.

1940
02:33:39,325 --> 02:33:46,169
[SPEAKER_02]: Acer800 says, A big F you to my trig teacher who is a lazy master student who teaches shit during class.

1941
02:33:46,549 --> 02:33:52,633
[SPEAKER_02]: And F you to the lady who was behind me while I was driving and freaking honked at me when there was a cop in front of me and I didn't want to be arrested.

1942
02:33:55,652 --> 02:34:02,115
[SPEAKER_02]: LegendOfZaku says, F you to not having a modded slim PS2 and some Bomani games when I should have had them by now.

1943
02:34:02,616 --> 02:34:05,337
[SPEAKER_02]: F you to my ever so weak and shitty DDR stamina.

1944
02:34:05,817 --> 02:34:11,741
[SPEAKER_02]: F you to me being a bitch about whether or not to compete in freestyle in a major tourney that you probably already know about next Saturday.

1945
02:34:13,461 --> 02:34:17,544
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkTetsuya says, F you to Mission C30 and the mission with Dynamite Ravoni.

1946
02:34:18,384 --> 02:34:20,085
[SPEAKER_02]: God, you have a lot of angst tonight, chatroom.

1947
02:34:20,612 --> 02:34:24,573
[SPEAKER_02]: F you to the fanboy, says Ron Chan, at the Yoko Ishida concert.

1948
02:34:25,273 --> 02:34:26,973
[SPEAKER_02]: No one cares you came from Boston.

1949
02:34:27,013 --> 02:34:28,154
[SPEAKER_02]: You were loud and rude.

1950
02:34:28,234 --> 02:34:29,414
[SPEAKER_02]: Go jump in traffic.

1951
02:34:32,415 --> 02:34:34,995
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm going to use that at some point this week during a call.

1952
02:34:35,075 --> 02:34:36,735
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, tell one of your callers to go jump in traffic.

1953
02:34:38,396 --> 02:34:39,216
[SPEAKER_16]: Enjoy your life.

1954
02:34:39,556 --> 02:34:40,736
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not going to pay your claim.

1955
02:34:40,776 --> 02:34:41,916
[SPEAKER_02]: Go jump in traffic.

1956
02:34:42,017 --> 02:34:47,378
[SPEAKER_02]: Color of Sakura says, F you to all the stuff I bought on eBay in the last month, and it's still not being here.

1957
02:34:47,618 --> 02:34:49,078
[SPEAKER_02]: F you to the brake modifier in New York.

1958
02:34:49,946 --> 02:34:57,171
[SPEAKER_02]: And lastly, GS191 says, F you to my college for putting all my core classes, especially math, online.

1959
02:34:57,731 --> 02:35:01,213
[SPEAKER_02]: F you to websites that are taken down without warning and call it redesigning.

1960
02:35:01,293 --> 02:35:03,875
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I'm looking at you, DDRmaniaX and BomaniStyle.

1961
02:35:04,475 --> 02:35:06,957
[SPEAKER_02]: F you to myself for not having any better F yous.

1962
02:35:07,457 --> 02:35:07,817
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck!

1963
02:35:09,639 --> 02:35:09,979
[SPEAKER_02]: The end.

1964
02:35:10,839 --> 02:35:12,300
[SPEAKER_02]: God, you guys had a lot of angst.

1965
02:35:13,101 --> 02:35:14,522
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are just mean people.

1966
02:35:15,422 --> 02:35:16,063
[SPEAKER_02]: Mean people.

1967
02:35:17,684 --> 02:35:17,904
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1968
02:35:19,364 --> 02:35:22,226
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember kids, down the road, not across the street

1969
02:35:48,109 --> 02:35:55,485
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, we're going to get to the rest of the Extreme 2 music I wanted to play tonight.

1970
02:35:55,505 --> 02:35:58,331
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to play Spin Spin Sugar.

1971
02:35:59,480 --> 02:36:01,302
[SPEAKER_02]: Tomorrow Tomorrow Tomorrow Tomorrow Tomorrow

1972
02:36:19,264 --> 02:36:20,564
[SPEAKER_02]: Ask Orange Lounge when we come back.

1973
02:36:20,844 --> 02:36:22,465
[SPEAKER_02]: And you guys had a lot of questions last week.

1974
02:36:22,485 --> 02:36:23,545
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't even get to all of them.

1975
02:36:23,605 --> 02:36:25,526
[SPEAKER_02]: So we missed your question last week.

1976
02:36:25,566 --> 02:36:28,266
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's your chance to get it answered after we come back.

1977
02:36:28,346 --> 02:36:32,667
[SPEAKER_02]: So send a private message to Sky with your question for Ask Orange Lounge.

1978
02:36:33,048 --> 02:36:34,208
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be back after this.

1979
02:36:59,868 --> 02:37:01,848
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for watching!

02:38:37,719 --> 02:38:40,062
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like to be with you.

1981
02:38:40,102 --> 02:38:43,044
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got to take it easy.

1982
02:38:43,064 --> 02:38:45,907
[SPEAKER_09]: Capture and pray.

1983
02:38:46,047 --> 02:38:48,189
I've got so much to show you.

1984
02:38:48,349 --> 02:38:50,551
I've got so much to show you.

1989
02:41:11,846 --> 02:41:15,028
[SPEAKER_10]: After this song, we'll be having a Let Them Move Marathon.

1990
02:41:42,288 --> 02:41:42,948
[SPEAKER_02]: Just kidding.

1991
02:41:43,368 --> 02:41:44,409
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Lounge Radio.

1992
02:41:44,489 --> 02:41:46,089
[SPEAKER_02]: Crap-free Bomani Radio.

1993
02:41:46,490 --> 02:41:47,130
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back, kids.

1994
02:41:47,150 --> 02:41:49,171
[SPEAKER_02]: We're about ready to get into Ask Orange Lounge.

1995
02:41:49,271 --> 02:42:00,076
[SPEAKER_02]: However, first off, I wanted to point out that we actually have somebody who... There was an FU back there that was about Bomani style and how they're down all the time.

1996
02:42:00,176 --> 02:42:05,699
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, we have somebody who happens to be one of their moderators over at Bomani Style that would like us to clarify...

1997
02:42:06,482 --> 02:42:08,083
[SPEAKER_02]: They aren't down for redesigning.

1998
02:42:08,143 --> 02:42:10,765
[SPEAKER_02]: The motherboard on their server went kaboom.

1999
02:42:11,606 --> 02:42:15,489
[SPEAKER_02]: There's been word, however, that MimaniStyle 7.0 is progressing nicely, however.

2000
02:42:16,089 --> 02:42:17,931
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a friendly clarification.

2001
02:42:18,211 --> 02:42:21,193
[SPEAKER_17]: I need to also make the announcement, the one that I mentioned to you during the break.

2002
02:42:21,353 --> 02:42:21,613
[SPEAKER_17]: Sure.

2003
02:42:22,414 --> 02:42:28,699
[SPEAKER_17]: There will not be a Pump Up the Volume this week because of other reasons.

2004
02:42:29,659 --> 02:42:35,924
[SPEAKER_17]: But I will be returning the week after with the much-promised, because actually people did ask for it, Blur Marathon event.

2005
02:42:36,623 --> 02:42:38,305
[SPEAKER_02]: Ask Gorn's Lounge

2006
02:43:00,003 --> 02:43:02,964
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.

2007
02:43:03,444 --> 02:43:06,666
[SPEAKER_02]: What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?

2008
02:43:07,366 --> 02:43:08,526
[SPEAKER_02]: My question is this.

2009
02:43:08,987 --> 02:43:14,109
[SPEAKER_02]: Who will be the first person to use the word fuck ass in their question?

2010
02:43:18,470 --> 02:43:21,272
[SPEAKER_02]: MPQ says, what would your ultimate video game be?

2011
02:43:24,813 --> 02:43:29,595
[SPEAKER_02]: Golf Land Birthday Party Sniper would be my ultimate video game.

2012
02:43:31,411 --> 02:43:33,612
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, do you have an ultimate video game?

2013
02:43:34,252 --> 02:43:34,952
[SPEAKER_02]: The Guardian Legend.

2014
02:43:36,272 --> 02:43:41,233
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, I'm not sure if the question is like... Completely redone for one of the new systems.

2015
02:43:41,593 --> 02:43:43,534
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be very sexy.

2016
02:43:43,694 --> 02:43:45,154
[SPEAKER_17]: Guardian Legend, the MMORPG.

2017
02:43:47,015 --> 02:43:49,395
[SPEAKER_02]: Extifer, what would your ultimate video game be?

2018
02:43:50,636 --> 02:43:51,396
[SPEAKER_02]: In the ass.

2019
02:43:52,716 --> 02:43:54,497
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, what would your ultimate video game be?

2020
02:43:54,517 --> 02:43:55,997
[SPEAKER_25]: Um...

2021
02:43:57,867 --> 02:44:01,631
[SPEAKER_25]: I think they should have a fighting game with every character from all the systems.

2022
02:44:02,212 --> 02:44:03,273
[SPEAKER_25]: Just one giant brawl.

2023
02:44:03,813 --> 02:44:06,256
[SPEAKER_25]: Call it, like, Console Wars or something like that.

2024
02:44:09,339 --> 02:44:09,720
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2025
02:44:12,243 --> 02:44:14,525
[SPEAKER_02]: Allusion says, What's it all about, Alfie?

2026
02:44:16,888 --> 02:44:17,969
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want... Well...

2027
02:44:19,525 --> 02:44:21,565
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't watch crappy Jude Law movies, so I don't know.

2028
02:44:21,846 --> 02:44:25,426
[SPEAKER_02]: And I didn't watch the crappy original either, I'm sorry to say, so I don't really know what it's all about.

2029
02:44:25,446 --> 02:44:26,467
[SPEAKER_16]: Apparently they weren't crappy.

2030
02:44:26,507 --> 02:44:28,747
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, they got some critical mass, didn't they?

2031
02:44:28,767 --> 02:44:30,408
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the first one I'm sure was critically loved.

2032
02:44:30,428 --> 02:44:33,668
[SPEAKER_17]: You say Alfie, I start thinking of, like, in Barbarella, her ship.

2033
02:44:34,148 --> 02:44:34,469
[SPEAKER_02]: Alfie.

2034
02:44:34,569 --> 02:44:38,249
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think of the little creature from Melmac that liked to eat cats.

2035
02:44:38,269 --> 02:44:39,070
[SPEAKER_02]: That's Alf!

2036
02:44:39,890 --> 02:44:41,690
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you could call him Alfie as a nickname.

2037
02:44:41,710 --> 02:44:44,291
[SPEAKER_17]: No.

2038
02:44:44,451 --> 02:44:44,571
[SPEAKER_17]: Ha!

2039
02:44:44,811 --> 02:44:45,511
[SPEAKER_17]: I kill me!

2040
02:44:45,971 --> 02:44:46,591
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn you people.

2041
02:44:47,472 --> 02:44:48,792
[SPEAKER_16]: He, he, ha, ha, ha, ha.

2042
02:44:50,441 --> 02:44:54,442
[SPEAKER_02]: Brightsta says, can you pass me the first of the Mario Mix songs we heard?

2043
02:44:54,482 --> 02:44:56,603
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to add Captain Lou Albano to it.

2044
02:44:57,063 --> 02:44:59,743
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, kids, piracy is wrong.

2045
02:45:00,344 --> 02:45:01,084
[SPEAKER_02]: Email me off air.

2046
02:45:02,864 --> 02:45:07,445
[SPEAKER_02]: However, it did sound an awful lot like, you know, the... Actually, let me get into this.

2047
02:45:07,845 --> 02:45:08,686
[SPEAKER_02]: Do the Mario!

2048
02:45:08,706 --> 02:45:11,126
[SPEAKER_02]: Swing your arms from side to side.

2049
02:45:11,166 --> 02:45:12,407
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on, it's time to go.

2050
02:45:12,567 --> 02:45:13,447
[SPEAKER_05]: Do the Mario!

2051
02:45:17,008 --> 02:45:17,768
[SPEAKER_16]: Total silence.

2052
02:45:23,455 --> 02:45:30,937
[SPEAKER_02]: Socorina says, will my request for that Diverse System remix of Quasar be played before the end of the show?

2053
02:45:32,257 --> 02:45:37,178
[SPEAKER_02]: Not likely tonight, my friend, but probably next week when we don't have so much Extreme 2 music to worry about.

2054
02:45:38,059 --> 02:45:44,840
[SPEAKER_02]: Socorina says, what does each member of the Orange Lounge Radio crew prefer, hairy or hairless balls?

2055
02:45:52,629 --> 02:45:53,449
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a toss-up.

2056
02:45:54,090 --> 02:46:02,354
[SPEAKER_16]: Because, you know, there's some days where I'm like, you know, wake up in the morning, you know, and, you know, want to get my daily, you know, porn for breakfast.

2057
02:46:02,514 --> 02:46:05,356
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's like, maybe I want to see hairy balls.

2058
02:46:06,516 --> 02:46:11,079
[SPEAKER_16]: Sometimes, you know, I wake up in the morning and I want to see hairless balls.

2059
02:46:12,179 --> 02:46:16,121
[SPEAKER_16]: Sometimes I have that, you know, aching desire to shave my own balls.

2060
02:46:16,401 --> 02:46:16,762
[SPEAKER_16]: Loki.

2061
02:46:17,222 --> 02:46:17,722
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, here you go.

2062
02:46:18,373 --> 02:46:22,875
[SPEAKER_25]: How about balls that aren't as hot as the surface of the sun and fucking sweaty all the time?

2063
02:46:23,615 --> 02:46:24,896
[SPEAKER_25]: Those are the balls that we prefer.

2064
02:46:25,816 --> 02:46:27,097
[SPEAKER_02]: How about bowling balls?

2065
02:46:29,398 --> 02:46:30,258
[SPEAKER_25]: I like cheese balls.

2066
02:46:31,019 --> 02:46:31,799
[SPEAKER_25]: Cheese balls are good.

2067
02:46:32,139 --> 02:46:39,823
[SPEAKER_02]: Jazz says... Jazz, the answer to your question is I can't say that on air.

2068
02:46:41,763 --> 02:46:42,404
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what it is.

2069
02:46:43,664 --> 02:46:44,865
[SPEAKER_17]: I like meatballs.

2070
02:46:47,059 --> 02:46:47,619
[SPEAKER_02]: For my Kia.

2071
02:46:47,639 --> 02:46:48,620
[SPEAKER_02]: Me and cheese balls.

2072
02:46:49,900 --> 02:46:51,341
[SPEAKER_02]: Jazz, don't repeat it.

2073
02:46:51,561 --> 02:46:52,281
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't repeat it, Jazz.

2074
02:46:53,062 --> 02:47:00,205
[SPEAKER_02]: Zachu says, what will I win if I guess the DDR song used in last Friday's episode of MTV2's Video Mods featuring DDR Extreme 2?

2075
02:47:02,246 --> 02:47:02,686
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

2076
02:47:03,067 --> 02:47:05,128
[SPEAKER_17]: Does anybody in this room watch MTV?

2077
02:47:05,288 --> 02:47:06,088
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, I don't watch it.

2078
02:47:06,148 --> 02:47:06,488
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't.

2079
02:47:06,528 --> 02:47:07,329
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they giving it away?

2080
02:47:07,349 --> 02:47:08,309
[SPEAKER_17]: Reject boss icons!

2081
02:47:08,429 --> 02:47:09,330
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they giving it away?

2082
02:47:09,350 --> 02:47:09,970
[SPEAKER_16]: Because we're not.

2083
02:47:10,270 --> 02:47:13,852
[SPEAKER_16]: After they did that next marathon for like five days straight, I was like...

2084
02:47:15,325 --> 02:47:16,626
[SPEAKER_16]: I can't watch this channel anymore.

2085
02:47:19,308 --> 02:47:23,052
[SPEAKER_02]: Jaded wants to know, where did you get the Ask Orange Lounge intro music?

2086
02:47:23,392 --> 02:47:28,876
[SPEAKER_02]: The Ask Orange Lounge intro music is actually Journey to the Wonderland from Keyboard Mania 2.

2087
02:47:30,718 --> 02:47:33,540
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Keyboard Mania 2, it's Journey to the Wonderland by NPB.

2088
02:47:34,821 --> 02:47:38,845
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the lyrics, of course, are sung by yours truly, One and Only Sky.

2089
02:47:43,343 --> 02:47:44,463
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, let's see.

2090
02:47:45,324 --> 02:47:51,088
[SPEAKER_02]: Dark Knight says, Hey Sky, you should play Get Busy just to throw the chat room off.

2091
02:47:51,609 --> 02:47:57,453
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, you know, there's a reason I didn't play Get Busy tonight, and that's because I had to play it, um, 20 times this week in Mission Mode.

2092
02:47:58,714 --> 02:48:03,417
[SPEAKER_02]: Rini wants to know, Could you help a poor soul with my break problem, pretty please?

2093
02:48:03,857 --> 02:48:07,300
[SPEAKER_02]: I already use Step Mania, and I can't do that fuck-ass syncing.

2094
02:48:08,821 --> 02:48:09,421
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, hee hee.

2095
02:48:10,042 --> 02:48:10,102
[SPEAKER_02]: Um,

2096
02:48:10,703 --> 02:48:15,384
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Break, I remember, was in one of the Oni courses in Extreme, wasn't it?

2097
02:48:15,424 --> 02:48:18,864
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you had to play Sexy Planet Oni on Break or something, and it was a bitch.

2098
02:48:19,545 --> 02:48:27,666
[SPEAKER_02]: The best way to do it was to play that song over and over in regular mode, and so you kind of, like, you start to hear your feet as a separate rhythm in your head.

2099
02:48:28,166 --> 02:48:30,006
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very similar to the way you get really good at 2DX.

2100
02:48:30,026 --> 02:48:31,927
[SPEAKER_02]: You start to hear what the key patterns sound like in your head.

2101
02:48:31,947 --> 02:48:38,548
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what you're going to have to do with this DDR thing, is play the song over and over in regular mode and hear the pattern of the steps in your head, and then...

2102
02:48:39,228 --> 02:48:42,109
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, then again, if it's a song he hasn't unlocked yet, I guess you're just fucked.

2103
02:48:42,209 --> 02:48:43,230
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, I don't know what to tell you.

2104
02:48:44,651 --> 02:48:47,592
[SPEAKER_02]: Break, by the way, is when the arrows slow down as they reach the top.

2105
02:48:47,872 --> 02:48:49,793
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the reverse of boost.

2106
02:48:51,153 --> 02:48:55,395
[SPEAKER_02]: Bugged wants to know, what fuck-ass games have you had the joy of playing as of late?

2107
02:48:58,937 --> 02:48:59,217
[SPEAKER_02]: None.

2108
02:48:59,557 --> 02:49:00,978
[SPEAKER_02]: I played Pack'n Roll earlier today.

2109
02:49:00,998 --> 02:49:01,738
[SPEAKER_02]: It was kind of cool.

2110
02:49:01,798 --> 02:49:03,119
[SPEAKER_24]: I'll talk about that more on the podcast.

2111
02:49:03,539 --> 02:49:05,480
[SPEAKER_24]: I can't even remember the last video game I played.

2112
02:49:07,103 --> 02:49:08,944
[SPEAKER_24]: Didn't I make you play something?

2113
02:49:08,964 --> 02:49:09,904
[SPEAKER_17]: Sweaty Balls of the Game.

2114
02:49:10,404 --> 02:49:11,425
[SPEAKER_17]: Final Fantasy XI?

2115
02:49:11,465 --> 02:49:11,845
[SPEAKER_17]: Hello.

2116
02:49:12,225 --> 02:49:13,546
[SPEAKER_16]: As in Sweaty Balls of the Game.

2117
02:49:14,066 --> 02:49:15,186
[SPEAKER_16]: Sweaty Balls of the Game.

2118
02:49:16,207 --> 02:49:16,487
[SPEAKER_25]: Loki?

2119
02:49:16,707 --> 02:49:18,668
[SPEAKER_17]: As in The White Mage is the Bitch of the Game.

2120
02:49:18,988 --> 02:49:21,089
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, I had to feed Taco again this morning.

2121
02:49:21,109 --> 02:49:24,010
[SPEAKER_25]: He hasn't run away yet, even though I haven't fed him for three days.

2122
02:49:24,990 --> 02:49:26,351
[SPEAKER_25]: And I played Lost in Blue a bit.

2123
02:49:28,405 --> 02:49:30,907
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going to really get a dog named Taco.

2124
02:49:31,388 --> 02:49:32,669
[SPEAKER_17]: That's a cool name for a child.

2125
02:49:32,729 --> 02:49:47,562
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm telling you, after the joke last night about why Helen Keller's dog ran away, my next dog's name is... The other day I was telling Helen Keller jokes to Loki and his fiancée and they just loved it.

2126
02:49:48,062 --> 02:49:50,284
[SPEAKER_02]: It was even funnier because I was partially drunk.

2127
02:49:51,649 --> 02:49:53,331
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the funniest I've seen you in a while.

2128
02:49:53,411 --> 02:49:56,314
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, I know, because I can't be funny unless I'm ripping off other people's jokes.

2129
02:49:56,354 --> 02:49:56,734
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.

2130
02:49:57,135 --> 02:49:58,776
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, we need your mama joke of the week.

2131
02:50:00,778 --> 02:50:01,299
[SPEAKER_02]: Give me a second.

2132
02:50:01,339 --> 02:50:02,159
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, you need to work on that.

2133
02:50:02,299 --> 02:50:02,540
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2134
02:50:04,862 --> 02:50:10,827
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkTreadStudio wants to know, Will Sky's voice, the video game, ever return, or is it doomed to obscurity?

2135
02:50:11,448 --> 02:50:12,929
[SPEAKER_02]: My friend, it is doomed to obscurity.

2136
02:50:12,949 --> 02:50:13,210
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

2137
02:50:14,187 --> 02:50:16,268
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an inside joke from like two and a half years ago on this.

2138
02:50:16,628 --> 02:50:28,772
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to get on the, we used to do, before we were a real structured station, not that we ever have been a structured station, but DarkSakura and I used to do what was called fuck-off shows where we would just randomly get on the stream.

2139
02:50:28,792 --> 02:50:29,792
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't have scheduled programs.

2140
02:50:30,032 --> 02:50:39,716
[SPEAKER_02]: We would just randomly, like it could be midnight on a Tuesday night, we would just randomly get on the stream and kick everyone off and go live and do our own show, just play music we wanted to play and do whatever the fuck we wanted.

2141
02:50:40,016 --> 02:50:43,757
[SPEAKER_02]: So we called it a fuck-off show because if you didn't like what we were doing, you could fuck off.

2142
02:50:45,069 --> 02:50:48,610
[SPEAKER_02]: and I used to get on there and I would sing my own versions of Bobani songs.

2143
02:50:48,650 --> 02:50:51,071
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I had my own version of Cowgirl and other things.

2144
02:50:51,291 --> 02:50:54,252
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think they're wondering if I'm going to do that again and the answer is no.

2145
02:50:55,233 --> 02:50:56,053
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, I have one.

2146
02:50:56,613 --> 02:50:56,813
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

2147
02:50:58,694 --> 02:50:59,934
[SPEAKER_17]: Your mama's so stupid.

2148
02:50:59,954 --> 02:51:00,614
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, wait, wait.

2149
02:51:00,694 --> 02:51:01,314
[SPEAKER_02]: I need the music.

2150
02:51:01,414 --> 02:51:01,895
[SPEAKER_02]: I need the music.

2151
02:51:02,035 --> 02:51:04,195
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to hype this up.

2152
02:51:05,536 --> 02:51:08,997
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I have never heard that Helen Keller joke before in the chat room there.

2153
02:51:10,097 --> 02:51:12,258
[SPEAKER_02]: What did Helen Keller do when she fell off a cliff?

2154
02:51:13,553 --> 02:51:14,974
[SPEAKER_02]: She screamed her hands off.

2155
02:51:15,654 --> 02:51:22,096
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to get some angry emails.

2156
02:51:23,096 --> 02:51:23,536
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all right.

2157
02:51:24,737 --> 02:51:26,538
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we do here on the show.

2158
02:51:27,018 --> 02:51:27,278
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2159
02:51:27,998 --> 02:51:28,418
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, hold on.

2160
02:51:29,338 --> 02:51:31,159
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't ready to do it.

2161
02:51:31,179 --> 02:51:33,200
[SPEAKER_16]: Go to your Big Boobs 1 icon.

2162
02:51:33,240 --> 02:51:36,321
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, you probably hit all my music in the Big Boobs folder.

2163
02:51:37,181 --> 02:51:38,982
[SPEAKER_16]: Peeing in glass bowls or whatever the shit.

2164
02:51:39,242 --> 02:51:42,163
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going to make up for it by saying a couple of them.

2165
02:51:43,274 --> 02:51:52,762
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright kids, it's DarkSakura's Yo Mama Joke of the Week.

2166
02:51:53,363 --> 02:51:53,903
[SPEAKER_22]: DarkSakura.

2167
02:51:53,923 --> 02:51:54,684
[SPEAKER_17]: I have a couple.

2168
02:51:55,485 --> 02:51:58,988
[SPEAKER_17]: Yo Mama's so stupid, I told her drinks were on the house so she went and got a lighter.

2169
02:51:59,828 --> 02:52:00,409
And my other one.

2170
02:52:04,719 --> 02:52:07,560
[SPEAKER_17]: Yo mama so stupid she took the Pepsi challenge and chose Coke.

2171
02:52:09,721 --> 02:52:10,221
[SPEAKER_17]: Wait.

2172
02:52:11,962 --> 02:52:14,383
[SPEAKER_17]: I said that joke wrong because I meant to be Mountain Dew.

2173
02:52:21,026 --> 02:52:23,567
[SPEAKER_17]: Yo mama so stupid she reckoned a quarterback was a refund.

2174
02:52:29,750 --> 02:52:30,911
[SPEAKER_16]: You're laughing at yourself.

2175
02:52:31,811 --> 02:52:34,112
[SPEAKER_17]: Yo mama so stupid she sold her car for gas money.

2176
02:52:34,653 --> 02:52:39,617
[SPEAKER_02]: Your mama says stupid, when you were born she looked at your umbilical cord and said, well, it comes with a cable.

2177
02:52:58,820 --> 02:53:04,622
[SPEAKER_02]: ColorofSakura wants to know, if you could remake any video game from the 16-bit era or earlier, what would it be?

2178
02:53:05,442 --> 02:53:06,383
[SPEAKER_02]: Guardian Legend.

2179
02:53:07,123 --> 02:53:07,923
[SPEAKER_02]: Street Fighter II.

2180
02:53:07,963 --> 02:53:08,323
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

2181
02:53:08,363 --> 02:53:09,204
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm kidding.

2182
02:53:09,244 --> 02:53:09,824
[SPEAKER_17]: Repeat the question.

2183
02:53:09,964 --> 02:53:13,345
[SPEAKER_02]: If you could remake any video game from the 16-bit era or earlier, what would it be?

2184
02:53:13,505 --> 02:53:14,125
[SPEAKER_17]: Guardian Legend.

2185
02:53:14,425 --> 02:53:14,925
[SPEAKER_02]: Kid Icarus.

2186
02:53:14,985 --> 02:53:15,846
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll say something different, then.

2187
02:53:18,767 --> 02:53:19,727
[SPEAKER_02]: Custer's Revenge.

2188
02:53:19,747 --> 02:53:21,007
[SPEAKER_16]: I just said Street Fighter II, man.

2189
02:53:21,808 --> 02:53:22,288
[SPEAKER_17]: X-Man.

2190
02:53:26,840 --> 02:53:29,383
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that they've already remade all the games that I like.

2191
02:53:30,724 --> 02:53:31,485
[SPEAKER_15]: Oregon Trail!

2192
02:53:32,946 --> 02:53:33,927
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like Metroid.

2193
02:53:35,208 --> 02:53:40,373
[SPEAKER_02]: And the last question we have tonight, Nince wants to know, will Loki singing ever come back to the show?

2194
02:53:42,094 --> 02:53:44,677
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually have to wait for Karaoke Revolution Party to come out.

2195
02:53:45,237 --> 02:53:49,061
[SPEAKER_25]: I hope not, and we don't really have the setup for that, luckily.

2196
02:53:51,002 --> 02:53:52,724
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we can always make it happen.

2197
02:53:53,890 --> 02:53:54,390
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you can't.

2198
02:53:54,530 --> 02:53:56,171
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that you should play I'm Stayin' In.

2199
02:53:57,091 --> 02:53:58,211
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if I have it anymore.

2200
02:53:58,251 --> 02:53:59,111
[SPEAKER_02]: I gotta dig for it.

2201
02:54:00,031 --> 02:54:01,072
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to have it somewhere.

2202
02:54:01,632 --> 02:54:04,693
[SPEAKER_02]: We gotta do a retrospective episode at the end of the year or something, and we'll do it on that.

2203
02:54:04,733 --> 02:54:05,173
[SPEAKER_25]: What, Loki?

2204
02:54:05,293 --> 02:54:05,473
[SPEAKER_25]: What?

2205
02:54:06,393 --> 02:54:10,074
[SPEAKER_25]: I know where I should put that song, even though I don't want to put that song there.

2206
02:54:10,214 --> 02:54:10,494
[SPEAKER_22]: Hmm.

2207
02:54:11,994 --> 02:54:12,554
[SPEAKER_25]: On the thing.

2208
02:54:12,874 --> 02:54:13,795
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, the thing, yeah.

2209
02:54:13,975 --> 02:54:14,235
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

2210
02:54:15,215 --> 02:54:15,295
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

2211
02:54:16,152 --> 02:54:16,733
[SPEAKER_02]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2212
02:54:34,758 --> 02:54:44,405
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what we should do is get Loki to go to one of those recording studios that they have at the theme park and cut his own CD because I did that once and the old radio program I was on years ago before this show.

2213
02:54:44,645 --> 02:54:45,846
[SPEAKER_17]: I remember that.

2214
02:54:46,146 --> 02:54:46,867
[SPEAKER_17]: I was there.

2215
02:54:46,887 --> 02:54:48,107
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I went to Great America.

2216
02:54:48,147 --> 02:54:48,568
[SPEAKER_02]: Six Flags.

2217
02:54:48,608 --> 02:54:49,448
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no, it's not Six Flags.

2218
02:54:49,508 --> 02:54:51,530
[SPEAKER_17]: It was Paramount.

2219
02:54:51,570 --> 02:54:52,831
[SPEAKER_17]: We went to see Margaret Cho.

2220
02:54:53,271 --> 02:54:53,891
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

2221
02:55:14,092 --> 02:55:17,494
[SPEAKER_16]: I saved the best for last by what's her name?

2222
02:55:18,575 --> 02:55:43,171
[SPEAKER_02]: Penthouse model, American Beauty Queen Vanessa Williams So I recorded this song and then somehow the CD fell into the hands of Travis who was the host over on Understation Live and every week he would play that song and make fun of it I don't know Alright

2223
02:55:45,515 --> 02:55:47,716
[SPEAKER_24]: I think it's about time to wrap up the show, boys and girls.

2224
02:55:47,956 --> 02:55:48,337
[SPEAKER_24]: We're done.

2225
02:55:48,817 --> 02:55:49,437
[SPEAKER_24]: The show's over.

2226
02:55:49,797 --> 02:55:50,077
[SPEAKER_24]: I know.

2227
02:55:50,197 --> 02:55:51,498
[SPEAKER_24]: Sadness, huh?

2228
02:55:51,618 --> 02:55:52,539
[SPEAKER_24]: First off, it's already over.

2229
02:55:52,579 --> 02:55:53,239
[SPEAKER_24]: Can I get quiet now?

2230
02:55:54,039 --> 02:55:54,640
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, if you want.

2231
02:55:54,660 --> 02:55:55,080
[SPEAKER_24]: You can go cry.

2232
02:55:55,100 --> 02:55:56,800
[SPEAKER_16]: I've never stayed through a whole show before.

2233
02:55:56,961 --> 02:55:57,201
[SPEAKER_16]: I know.

2234
02:55:57,801 --> 02:55:59,602
[SPEAKER_02]: You were our special guest tonight, extra.

2235
02:55:59,642 --> 02:56:01,002
[SPEAKER_02]: I was a special guest.

2236
02:56:01,223 --> 02:56:01,903
[SPEAKER_02]: Extra special.

2237
02:56:01,963 --> 02:56:03,343
[SPEAKER_02]: Our chat room seems to like you.

2238
02:56:03,363 --> 02:56:04,264
[SPEAKER_02]: They do.

2239
02:56:04,344 --> 02:56:10,847
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them think we should add you on permanently, and to that I say... You gave us the Bleach Household joke.

2240
02:56:11,587 --> 02:56:12,007
[SPEAKER_17]: What was that?

2241
02:56:12,107 --> 02:56:13,448
[SPEAKER_17]: You gave us the Bleach Tassel joke.

2242
02:56:13,548 --> 02:56:16,068
[SPEAKER_16]: I did give you that Bleach Tassel joke.

2243
02:56:16,208 --> 02:56:18,489
[SPEAKER_16]: I am taking immense pride over that.

2244
02:56:21,370 --> 02:56:22,971
[SPEAKER_16]: That is really funny.

2245
02:56:23,191 --> 02:56:24,031
[SPEAKER_16]: Keep doing that.

2246
02:56:24,191 --> 02:56:25,611
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, let's go around.

2247
02:56:26,072 --> 02:56:27,552
[SPEAKER_02]: I am going to choke that ferret.

2248
02:56:30,013 --> 02:56:31,953
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

2249
02:56:32,994 --> 02:56:37,875
[SPEAKER_17]: We sent Zero on fire and sent him back to his flea infested... I'm sorry, did I say that on the air?

2250
02:56:38,255 --> 02:56:39,996
[SPEAKER_17]: We sent him back to live in a hole.

2251
02:56:41,115 --> 02:56:42,196
[SPEAKER_25]: Extifer, your final thought.

2252
02:56:45,579 --> 02:56:51,825
[SPEAKER_16]: Akira Yamamoka should be a drink called Akira Yamamoka.

2253
02:56:56,109 --> 02:56:57,270
[SPEAKER_16]: Wait, did I pronounce his name right?

2254
02:56:58,551 --> 02:56:59,011
[SPEAKER_16]: I hate you.

2255
02:57:00,112 --> 02:57:01,253
[SPEAKER_16]: Loki, your final thought.

2256
02:57:04,816 --> 02:57:06,678
[SPEAKER_02]: Extifer, hand him the goddamn microphone.

2257
02:57:06,698 --> 02:57:07,639
[SPEAKER_02]: My microphone?

2258
02:57:09,116 --> 02:57:10,957
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, turn on the goddamn microphone.

2259
02:57:11,658 --> 02:57:12,658
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all his fault.

2260
02:57:13,298 --> 02:57:15,100
[SPEAKER_25]: This is why your novel would be on the show.

2261
02:57:15,220 --> 02:57:15,520
[SPEAKER_25]: Never.

2262
02:57:16,801 --> 02:57:17,341
[SPEAKER_25]: Never, ever.

2263
02:57:17,361 --> 02:57:18,562
[SPEAKER_25]: I've been evicted from the room.

2264
02:57:19,502 --> 02:57:21,143
[SPEAKER_25]: No one can hear you because you don't have the microphone.

2265
02:57:21,283 --> 02:57:22,564
[SPEAKER_25]: Anyways.

2266
02:57:23,544 --> 02:57:27,267
[SPEAKER_25]: My final thought is... I have to finish the thing.

2267
02:57:27,467 --> 02:57:28,627
[SPEAKER_25]: But it's done, pretty much.

2268
02:57:29,448 --> 02:57:30,208
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, super.

2269
02:57:32,570 --> 02:57:35,511
[SPEAKER_02]: And my final thought, just for you, chat room, you bitches.

2270
02:57:36,252 --> 02:57:37,412
[SPEAKER_02]: My final thought is Polovistian.

2271
02:57:37,472 --> 02:57:37,993
[SPEAKER_02]: Polovistian.

2272
02:57:39,673 --> 02:57:40,395
[SPEAKER_02]: Pavlostian.

2273
02:57:40,495 --> 02:57:41,336
[SPEAKER_02]: Pavlostian.

2274
02:57:42,479 --> 02:57:43,260
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate you guys.

2275
02:57:43,982 --> 02:57:46,046
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, your final thought.

2276
02:57:46,768 --> 02:57:51,177
[SPEAKER_17]: Reject false icons and sweaty balls.

2277
02:57:52,299 --> 02:57:54,240
[SPEAKER_02]: One word to sum it all up.

2278
02:57:54,300 --> 02:57:55,680
[SPEAKER_02]: To shut the show up.
