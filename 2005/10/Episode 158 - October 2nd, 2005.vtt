Muh-uh-muh-chuh-muh-kaw-key.

02:20.440 --> 02:24.340

And this is episode number 158 for this October the 2nd of 2005.

03:02.740 --> 03:09.740
You're tuned in to Orange Lounge Radio, radio that gamers really want, and this is Orange Lounge Radio Live.

03:09.740 --> 03:13.500
You're home for all the news and discussion on rhythm and music games,

03:13.500 --> 03:16.980
as well as the gamer community and the pop culture world.

03:16.980 --> 03:20.980
We're plugged in and fully interactive through our website at

03:20.980 --> 03:26.340
www.orangeloungeradio.com. My name is Rob Roberts. You might know me as Sky.

03:26.340 --> 03:30.420
Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts. In this corner, the happiest

03:30.420 --> 03:31.660
bunny on the farm, Ms.

03:31.660 --> 03:34.700
Dark Sakura. I've got legs.

03:34.700 --> 03:38.220
You got legs? Do you like bread?

03:38.220 --> 03:41.500
Did you say you got legs? I have legs.

03:41.500 --> 03:46.740
Oh, that's good. Legs are good. I was listening to some of my Eddie Izzard stuff before I left.

03:46.740 --> 03:50.580
Especially if you're trying to play DDR, legs are a good thing. No.

03:50.580 --> 03:54.740
There are people without legs who play DDR. Or at least who work on them.

03:54.740 --> 03:58.820
How do you play DDR without legs? There's a guy who played with the crutches.

03:58.820 --> 04:02.220
Oh yeah, that infamous video. Pretty cool.

04:02.220 --> 04:05.900
On the intranet. Alright.

04:05.900 --> 04:14.900
Well, um, also not here tonight, just yet, is Loki. He's actually running a little bit tardy tonight, and you know what that means, kids?

04:14.900 --> 04:15.900
Fired!

04:15.900 --> 04:17.900
Oh, darn.

04:17.900 --> 04:22.900
He'll be, he'll be here soon enough. And actually, we're kind of bummed because we don't have any special guests tonight.

04:22.900 --> 04:25.900
There's us. We're special enough.

04:25.900 --> 04:28.900
Yeah, it's just the three of us, and of course your calls on the Skyplane.

04:28.900 --> 04:30.900
No, we haven't, we have somebody who's returned to the show.

04:30.900 --> 04:31.900
Oh, goody who?

04:31.900 --> 04:39.900
I forgot to tell you what I found this week, after incessant listener demand.

04:39.900 --> 04:42.900
We dug him up.

04:42.900 --> 04:47.900
So, Loki will be here soon enough.

04:47.900 --> 04:54.900
Actually, what's kind of sad is that Miklotov, one of our regular guests, was just here, not even an hour ago,

04:54.900 --> 04:57.620
and was going to stay for the show but unfortunately

04:57.620 --> 04:59.180
due to some

04:59.180 --> 05:04.260
commuting issues had to get back before the show started so he says hi

05:04.260 --> 05:04.880
and I guess

05:04.880 --> 05:07.420
too bad he couldn't be here tonight because you know obviously we're talking about

05:07.420 --> 05:10.940
EX2 and for once he could have talked about pretty much everything with EX2

05:10.940 --> 05:11.740
but

05:11.740 --> 05:15.020
we'll get him back here another week and talk about all that fun stuff after you guys have

05:15.020 --> 05:16.420
unlocked all the stuff

05:16.420 --> 05:20.500
which is one thing I should say is that tonight we are going to be playing lots of

05:20.500 --> 05:21.760
music from

05:21.760 --> 05:23.880
Dance Dance Revolution Xtreme 2

05:23.880 --> 05:28.680
We're going to play a lot of new music, which may include some things you haven't unlocked

05:28.680 --> 05:29.680
yet.

05:29.680 --> 05:33.840
So if you are wary of spoilers, unfortunately I'm going to tell you, you may not want to

05:33.840 --> 05:34.880
listen tonight.

05:34.880 --> 05:40.560
But honestly, there's some real good stuff, just stick with it.

05:40.560 --> 05:44.600
I'm assuming that a lot of people out there who were trying to really stay careful of

05:44.600 --> 05:49.520
the spoilers probably have either already unlocked this stuff by themselves by now or

05:49.520 --> 05:52.100
just don't care at this point, I don't know.

05:52.100 --> 05:55.660
So I just want to warn you guys, we are going to talk about and probably play some music

05:55.660 --> 06:01.300
that is unlockable in DDR Extreme 2, so you guys, it might be a spoiler, but who cares?

06:01.300 --> 06:03.940
The game's been out for several days now.

06:03.940 --> 06:04.940
We can spoil.

06:04.940 --> 06:07.700
If they don't want the spoiler, they can all go see Serenity.

06:07.700 --> 06:09.020
Yeah, we'll talk about...

06:09.020 --> 06:11.740
So that it can make the 80 million and we get a sequel.

06:11.740 --> 06:13.980
We'll talk about Serenity, yes.

06:13.980 --> 06:16.620
And we'll talk about other stuff too.

06:16.620 --> 06:18.660
I want to talk about that big, big secret.

06:18.660 --> 06:32.660
It's not really a secret. It's out there and people have been wanting this in a Bomani game for so, so long and it's out there and nobody, I know somebody found it because people are talking about it, but nobody I know knew about this, really.

06:32.660 --> 06:37.660
Except Miggletop who pointed it out to me. But we will talk about all that after this break, kids.

06:37.660 --> 06:43.660
So, let's get to the first break of DDR Extreme 2 Music.

06:43.660 --> 06:49.660
In this break, we're going to hear, As the Rush Comes, a little bit of Block Rockin' Beats,

06:49.660 --> 06:56.660
we're going to hear Genie in a Bottle, and we're going to hear I Will Survive all in this break.

06:56.660 --> 07:03.660
in this break. So we'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.

07:26.660 --> 07:41.660
We drift deeper into the sound Traveling somewhere, could be anywhere

07:41.660 --> 07:48.660
There's a coldness in the air, but I don't care

07:48.660 --> 07:55.660
We drift deeper into the sound, life goes on

07:55.660 --> 08:02.660
We drift deeper into the sound, feeling strong

08:02.660 --> 08:10.660
To bring it on, to bring it on

08:10.660 --> 08:17.660
He scraped me, he found me, and the rush comes

08:47.660 --> 08:52.660
into the sound of life goes on

08:52.660 --> 08:55.660
Oh, we did the same thing

09:52.660 --> 10:20.060
I'm back with another one of those block rockin' beats

10:20.060 --> 10:34.740
Lyrics from Part 3

10:34.760 --> 10:49.720
Subs by

11:19.720 --> 11:34.520
If you want to be with me, baby there's no such thing as

12:04.520 --> 12:29.960
I was petrified, here thinkin' I could never live without you by my side

12:29.960 --> 12:33.960
But then I spent so many nights thinking how you did me wrong

12:33.960 --> 12:34.960
And I put strong

12:34.960 --> 12:36.960
And I learned how to get along

12:36.960 --> 12:38.960
And so you're back

12:38.960 --> 12:40.960
From outer space

12:40.960 --> 12:42.960
I just walked in to find you here

12:42.960 --> 12:44.960
With that sad look upon your face

12:44.960 --> 12:46.960
I should have changed that even less

12:46.960 --> 12:48.960
I should have made you leave your feet

12:48.960 --> 12:50.960
I had known for just one second you'd be back

12:50.960 --> 12:51.960
You lied to me

12:51.960 --> 12:53.960
So I now go

12:53.960 --> 12:55.960
Walk out the door

12:55.960 --> 12:57.960
Just turn around now

12:57.960 --> 12:59.960
You're not welcome anymore

12:59.960 --> 13:02.960
But you're the one who tried to hurt me with your vibe

13:02.960 --> 13:04.960
You think I'd crumble?

13:04.960 --> 13:06.960
You think I'd stay down and die?

13:06.960 --> 13:07.960
No, not I

13:07.960 --> 13:09.960
I will survive

13:09.960 --> 13:13.960
Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll feel alive

13:13.960 --> 13:15.960
I've got all my life to live

13:15.960 --> 13:17.960
I've got all my love to give

13:17.960 --> 13:18.960
And I'll survive

13:18.960 --> 13:20.960
I will survive

13:20.960 --> 13:22.960
Hey, hey

13:50.960 --> 14:05.540
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

14:05.540 --> 14:11.200
We are in the midst of our October 2nd episode, of course we are live here, and it is episode

14:11.200 --> 14:12.200
number what, 158?

14:12.200 --> 14:14.200
I'm starting to lose count, we're getting so high.

14:14.200 --> 14:15.200
We're old.

14:15.200 --> 14:16.200
I know, God.

14:16.200 --> 14:18.440
We have to keep innovating.

14:18.440 --> 14:20.720
We're what, like three and a half years old now?

14:20.720 --> 14:21.720
Yeah, something like that.

14:21.720 --> 14:23.560
We're pretty well potty trained at this point,

14:23.560 --> 14:25.240
and we're going to start preschool soon.

14:25.240 --> 14:26.960
Yeah.

14:26.960 --> 14:29.480
We don't have to use the big kids' pants anymore.

14:29.480 --> 14:31.560
We have like pull-ups.

14:31.560 --> 14:33.040
Yeah.

14:33.040 --> 14:34.880
Mommy, wow, I'm a big kid now.

14:34.880 --> 14:39.640
Occasionally, we still do have an accident or two.

14:39.640 --> 14:42.320
All right, in that break, you did hear some music

14:42.320 --> 14:44.320
from Dance Dance Revolution Extreme 2.

14:44.320 --> 14:47.760
You heard As the Rush Comes, Block Rock and Beats,

14:47.760 --> 14:52.160
genie in a bottle and i will survive

14:52.160 --> 14:55.320
uh... dark soccer you really get a chance to know i'd i'd know you're

14:55.320 --> 14:57.600
eating cake over there let them eat cake

14:57.600 --> 14:59.800
uh... let us know i'm cheating

14:59.800 --> 15:01.060
of my bad

15:01.060 --> 15:04.600
nobody listens to the show it's okay

15:04.600 --> 15:06.840
no just kidding just kidding tons and tons

15:06.840 --> 15:10.240
hundreds upon hundreds of people want to listen to the show

15:10.240 --> 15:12.040
uh... and a couple do

15:12.040 --> 15:16.520
and they're in our chat room w w w dot orange launch radio dot com click on

15:16.520 --> 15:17.680

15:17.680 --> 15:22.220
and uh... there are no i'm sorry that's for the skype line click on chat

15:22.220 --> 15:23.860
this is going to be one of my tonight

15:23.860 --> 15:27.080
uh... click on chat and you can join our chat room and there's a whole bunch of

15:27.080 --> 15:28.420
fun people in there

15:28.420 --> 15:31.760
uh... what are you talking about right now uh... i think some some comments

15:31.760 --> 15:36.980
there are some thoughts of the songs i think that for the a carry a mocha

15:36.980 --> 15:40.500
we're assuming it's a cure we only know because the saying i think you're a cool

15:40.500 --> 15:44.040
i don't see how it couldn't be a carry a mocha honestly i think it was cool

15:44.040 --> 15:47.300
although it's like i'm very picky about that song and i would've been i will

15:47.300 --> 15:51.800
survive. But the Genie in the Bottle one made me feel highly nauseous. Genie in the Bottle's

15:51.800 --> 15:55.600
been a very split down the middle one in the community. Of course I've been reading a lot

15:55.600 --> 15:59.720
of feedback, not just on our forums over at OrangeLodgeRadio, but the more heavily used

15:59.720 --> 16:03.640
forums over at DDRFreak.com, and just a lot of feedback for Genie in the Bottle seems

16:03.640 --> 16:07.560
very polarized. A lot of people are like, wow, that's different, it's pretty cool. I

16:07.560 --> 16:10.840
think it just has to do with if you're like a trance whore or not, because if you're a

16:10.840 --> 16:13.540
trance whore, then of course you're going to like that. It sounds like every other trance

16:13.540 --> 16:16.360
song ever made. Yeah, if you're not a trance whore, you're probably not going to like it

16:16.360 --> 16:20.280
as much and it's let's face it it's still you know genie in a bottle and

16:20.280 --> 16:23.480
while genie in a bottle makes a great karaoke song for me

16:23.480 --> 16:27.320
um it's it's not a song that i like to hear

16:27.320 --> 16:32.280
otherwise anyway um now you didn't really get a chance to

16:32.280 --> 16:34.360
check out dance dance revolution extreme 2

16:34.360 --> 16:38.840
did you jamie you haven't really when i have no life

16:38.840 --> 16:44.200
no i did i i ran out and got it on tuesday i i'm gonna wait for loki to

16:44.200 --> 16:47.400
to get here because I think he's been playing it too so I'll wait and share my

16:47.400 --> 16:50.960
thoughts with him but in the meantime let's go ahead and start off tonight's

16:50.960 --> 16:54.560
show as we do every week playing a little bit of how was your cake how was

16:54.560 --> 16:59.200
your day and we'll start it off with the one and only dark Sakura the sugar is

16:59.200 --> 17:05.780
burning a path down my throat like vodka um I played Nintendogs lots and lots of

17:05.780 --> 17:11.700
puppies and that's it I'd even touch World of Warcraft although we did have

17:11.700 --> 17:15.120
like a very nerdy discussion friday night after serenity

17:15.120 --> 17:17.160
oh my gosh that was

17:17.160 --> 17:20.320
that was pretty cuz we were starting to talk about games for a little while we

17:20.320 --> 17:21.920
were talking about um...

17:21.920 --> 17:23.840
i don't know god what were we talking about

17:23.840 --> 17:28.260
different ddr's and stuff and and a couple of my... and our various mmo's

17:28.260 --> 17:28.960
oh yeah

17:28.960 --> 17:33.080
various mmo's we've played like Ragnarok and Final Fantasy 11 and World of Warcraft

17:33.080 --> 17:36.600
and City of Heroes and all this other stuff

17:36.600 --> 17:38.400
we were talking about all those games

17:38.400 --> 17:39.840
and

17:39.840 --> 17:42.600
one of my poor friends who isn't much of a gamer was just kind of sitting there

17:42.600 --> 17:43.000
going

17:43.000 --> 17:46.300
blink blink blink and this is also like his birthday dinner so

17:46.300 --> 17:51.040
and then we got on the uh... I should feel bad on to the uh... angel discussion and

17:51.040 --> 17:54.280
Buffy yeah then you guys started talking about Buffy and angel

17:54.280 --> 17:57.440
all night and then that was the part where I started going blink blink blink

17:57.440 --> 17:59.400
because I'm not much of a Joss Whedon whore

17:59.400 --> 18:02.480
granted I did go out and see Serenity because I was basically I was

18:02.480 --> 18:05.160
essentially dragged by all my friends who are Joss Whedon whores

18:05.160 --> 18:08.920
um but it was cool I like Serenity I'm not like OMFG

18:08.920 --> 18:13.900
serenity like I'm gonna make all my LJ icons serenity based I have a serenity

18:13.900 --> 18:18.340
icon okay I'm just teasing the general like I just noticed this huge influx

18:18.340 --> 18:22.660
this past couple weeks is just serenity whoredom amongst the nerds on my LJ list

18:22.660 --> 18:26.800
which is cool I mean god knows I have my nerdy things as well so I'm not one to

18:26.800 --> 18:30.220
judge but I just noticed that the past two weeks you know have been like

18:30.220 --> 18:34.660
serenity things been on overdrive so I'm not like omfg over the movie but it was

18:34.660 --> 18:41.620
good it was it was cool I liked the action scenes it was action packed I

18:41.620 --> 18:47.940
liked it that part at the end and I liked the black chick with a gun she was

18:47.940 --> 18:50.900
cool Zoe because black chick with guns are

18:50.900 --> 18:57.980
cool they are all right that's my that's my opinion on Serenity and Rob's movie

18:57.980 --> 19:01.460
review yeah no no we actually have extra for here and he's going to give his

19:01.460 --> 19:04.360
movie review a little later in the show. And he's actually sitting in Loki's show.

19:04.360 --> 19:05.360
Hello. Hi.

19:05.360 --> 19:07.960
You're our new co-host now. Oh, okay.

19:07.960 --> 19:10.360
If we fire Loki, you're going to have to step in here, so.

19:10.360 --> 19:18.560
Okay. I hate Macs and in the group. There you go. He fits right in. I love it.

19:18.560 --> 19:21.720
I have a Mac now. Is that a Mac? I hate you.

19:21.720 --> 19:28.200
I have a Mac now. I have an iMac that I named Easy Mac.

19:28.200 --> 19:34.640
That's cool. It's the graphite one, so it fits in with my dark personality.

19:34.640 --> 19:40.600
Except for what games do you play? Do you play the DDR games at all?

19:40.600 --> 19:45.560
I enjoy watching people play them. I like Pump It Up.

19:45.560 --> 19:52.120
No, I do, because as a person who's not very good at DDR, it felt more natural.

19:52.120 --> 19:57.160
Pump It Up felt more natural for me. That's interesting, because I think in a lot

19:57.160 --> 20:01.280
of ways Pump It Up is actually a harder game. Even to pick up and learn. I think DDR is

20:01.280 --> 20:05.040
a little more beginner friendly to Pump It Up. Not to not Pump It Up. I just don't see

20:05.040 --> 20:12.360
this as beginner friendly. I don't know. I just don't have that feet eye coordination

20:12.360 --> 20:15.760
that a lot of people do with these DDR games. Well you know it just takes practice. You

20:15.760 --> 20:21.120
should have seen me when I first started. I mean, God. You should see you now. Shut

20:21.120 --> 20:28.860
up again you should see you now yeah thank you all right anyway why is Fiona

20:28.860 --> 20:33.820
Apple on myspace because a lot of musicians put their profile thank you

20:33.820 --> 20:37.640
for completely derailing our previous topic that's all right a lot of

20:37.640 --> 20:43.340
musicians put their profiles on myspace and like f-list celebrities and D list

20:43.340 --> 20:46.820
celebrities put their profiles on myspace so people can add them or D list

20:46.820 --> 20:50.060
singers songwriters it's the singer songwriters and then like when you when

20:50.060 --> 20:54.140
When you add them to your MySpace, then they'll start spamming your comments with like,

20:54.140 --> 20:55.140
Hey!

20:55.140 --> 20:56.140
Come check out our show!

20:56.140 --> 20:59.360
And then they like paste a huge ass image of a flyer.

20:59.360 --> 21:02.980
This is my sister's MySpace for you guys, because my sister is like the biggest MySpace

21:02.980 --> 21:03.980
whore I know.

21:03.980 --> 21:07.020
My sister has over 1,000 friends on MySpace.

21:07.020 --> 21:08.020
I'm not even kidding.

21:08.020 --> 21:09.020
She has over 1,000 friends.

21:09.020 --> 21:11.280
I have 64.

21:11.280 --> 21:12.280
And I have 227.

21:12.280 --> 21:14.340
Well, we're not going to go there.

21:14.340 --> 21:18.860
And I've posted about 10 entries since I've had my...

21:18.860 --> 21:19.860
I don't post any entries.

21:19.860 --> 21:20.860
I don't either.

21:20.860 --> 21:21.860
I just have my profile.

21:21.860 --> 21:23.860
I have my live journal to post entries.

21:23.860 --> 21:31.140
And my sexy MySpace emo pics, which reminds me, last night, me, Exeterfer, John, and Precious

21:31.140 --> 21:33.220
Amanda were all here last night.

21:33.220 --> 21:37.540
See, you kind of have the emo pic thing going on on your MySpace.

21:37.540 --> 21:39.140
It's a good emo pic.

21:39.140 --> 21:41.380
Every MySpace profile, we're talking about MySpace, Dr. Tanya.

21:41.380 --> 21:43.260
That's me holding the camera over my head.

21:43.260 --> 21:47.520
See, that's the way to take an emo pic, is take a picture of yourself, okay?

21:47.520 --> 21:51.400
So we were actually taking emo pics last night because I think John was borrowing his parent's

21:51.400 --> 21:53.140
digital camera, which is kind of nice.

21:53.140 --> 21:56.240
So we were taking pictures of ourselves.

21:56.240 --> 21:59.640
We were doing that thing where you take a picture of yourself in the bathroom mirror

21:59.640 --> 22:05.040
and you're half-flexing and you look really sad, like you're going to cry, like you just

22:05.040 --> 22:08.440
listened to an entire Linkin Park album or something.

22:08.440 --> 22:11.120
Like Evanescence, you know?

22:11.120 --> 22:12.120
And then you're sad inside.

22:12.120 --> 22:15.120
But Evanescence makes me happy.

22:15.120 --> 22:16.120
Sarcasm.

22:16.120 --> 22:21.560
No, you know, Amanda and I, we were trying to do an emo pic where we were both in the

22:21.560 --> 22:25.500
bathroom and she was holding up the camera and taking a picture of us, which is funny

22:25.500 --> 22:30.540
because, you know, that way, you know, why would a person do that, you know, which makes

22:30.540 --> 22:32.020
it funny.

22:32.020 --> 22:33.540
I like that one better, Jimmy.

22:33.540 --> 22:38.540
I'm waiting to see how my emo pics turn out, but I will put them on my MySpace.

22:38.540 --> 22:42.700
And by the way, kids, Orange Lounge Radio has hopped on the MySpace bandwagon, toot

22:42.700 --> 22:43.700
toot!

22:43.700 --> 22:47.260
And we've got a club thingy on there.

22:47.260 --> 22:50.340
We haven't really done anything with it yet.

22:50.340 --> 22:51.380
But it's there.

22:51.380 --> 22:52.180
And join it.

22:52.180 --> 22:54.900
Because when a lot of people are in the club, then they'll go,

22:54.900 --> 22:57.380
hey, why are all my friends in this Orange Lawns Radio Club?

22:57.380 --> 22:59.020
And then they'll be likely to check out

22:59.020 --> 23:00.500
our station and our podcast.

23:00.500 --> 23:01.820
And then we get popular.

23:01.820 --> 23:04.160
And then we can sell commercials on this program.

23:04.160 --> 23:06.160
And we can all quit our day jobs and do Orange Lawns Radio

23:06.160 --> 23:06.660
forever.

23:06.660 --> 23:08.020
Yay!

23:08.020 --> 23:09.540
That means that I can't move.

23:09.540 --> 23:21.100
I don't even know how to access our club on MySpace.com.

23:21.100 --> 23:25.980
I think it's like MySpace.com slash clubs slash Orange Lounge Radio or something.

23:25.980 --> 23:27.860
Just do a search in the clubs for Orange Lounge Radio.

23:27.860 --> 23:31.620
I don't imagine that there's like some other club named Orange Lounge Radio.

23:31.620 --> 23:34.660
I'm pretty sure we're the only club named Orange Lounge Radio, because I can't think

23:34.660 --> 23:38.540
of anybody else that would call themselves Orange Lounge Radio, so look for that.

23:38.540 --> 23:41.540
So how was your gaming week, Rob?

23:41.540 --> 23:48.540
Well, I'll talk about my gaming week on the podcast, but I'll talk about my regular week now.

23:48.540 --> 23:49.540
Okay.

23:49.540 --> 23:52.540
Let's just mess with you.

23:52.540 --> 23:59.540
My week was kind of boring, and I barely slept last night at all, and I took a big ol' nap today,

23:59.540 --> 24:03.540
so I didn't really do anything on my Sunday, which kind of sucks. Stop laughing.

24:03.540 --> 24:06.540
But you didn't do anything with your Sunday?

24:06.540 --> 24:11.500
I went to Lions and ate, but you didn't do anything else?

24:11.500 --> 24:12.500
This program.

24:12.500 --> 24:13.500
Oh, okay.

24:13.500 --> 24:18.260
Yeah, but this is nothing noteworthy.

24:18.260 --> 24:22.240
I was starting to think that we're starting to do stuff like ice cream.

24:22.240 --> 24:23.240
Ice cream?

24:23.240 --> 24:24.240
We have ice cream?

24:24.240 --> 24:25.240
You're Sunday.

24:25.240 --> 24:26.980
Oh my god, we should totally get ice cream.

24:26.980 --> 24:27.980
I know, I totally want ice cream.

24:27.980 --> 24:28.980
We should.

24:28.980 --> 24:30.220
Xtifer, when Loki gets here, you're our ice cream bitch.

24:30.220 --> 24:33.540
You should go get us all a cold stone.

24:33.540 --> 24:34.540
Should I really?

24:34.540 --> 24:35.540
That would be awesome.

24:35.540 --> 24:37.140
I said I have no money.

24:37.140 --> 24:38.780
Oh, I don't either.

24:38.780 --> 24:41.940
Just give us a big tub of Ben and Jerry's.

24:41.940 --> 24:43.220
A big tub of Ben and Jerry's.

24:43.220 --> 24:43.980
Yes.

24:43.980 --> 24:46.660
Hey, is my picture, does it look emo?

24:46.660 --> 24:47.980
That particular picture, yes.

24:47.980 --> 24:49.580
But you know what's funny about that particular picture?

24:49.580 --> 24:50.940
We're looking at Myspace, which, by the way,

24:50.940 --> 24:53.260
makes for great radio right now, Extover,

24:53.260 --> 24:54.620
to be talking about pictures.

24:54.620 --> 24:55.980
It does.

24:55.980 --> 24:56.540
It's a picture.

24:56.540 --> 24:57.300
We should describe the picture.

24:57.300 --> 24:57.860
OK, we will.

24:57.860 --> 25:00.260
It's Extover, and he's kind of tilted toward the side.

25:00.260 --> 25:02.300
He's probably about three years younger in this picture,

25:02.300 --> 25:03.060
by the way.

25:03.060 --> 25:05.100
And his head's kind of tilted towards the side,

25:05.100 --> 25:10.340
he's got that I'm not wearing my glasses look he's got that look of it looks

25:10.340 --> 25:14.900
super sexy he's I'm not wearing my glasses you should post that in our chat

25:14.900 --> 25:19.580
oh you don't you're not in the chat room you can't post that I'll post it for the

25:19.580 --> 25:22.020
listeners later if they want to see you should show me how to get into the chat

25:22.020 --> 25:29.420
room during a break I will anyway the rest of my week I did a lot of work and

25:29.420 --> 25:33.100
and uh... i uh... did

25:33.100 --> 25:35.760
stuff i played a lot of d r

25:35.760 --> 25:38.700
somebody commented today that i look like i've lost weight and i credit that

25:38.700 --> 25:42.260
to the three days of d r the plane this week

25:42.260 --> 25:45.100
i'm just kidding and not not just for that but i've been playing quite a bit

25:45.100 --> 25:50.740
of d r and uh... it doesn't show

25:50.740 --> 25:52.340
all right you're still

25:52.340 --> 25:54.500
because you had a

25:54.500 --> 25:55.420
extra for

25:55.420 --> 25:57.620
why don't you know how was your week out today

25:57.620 --> 26:08.980
My week was good. I just worked at blah, blah, boring, et cetera, the end and stuff. We went

26:08.980 --> 26:19.980
and saw Serenity, which I should get to probably later on, but still it was great and stuff.

26:19.980 --> 26:24.540
And then today has been kind of boring. There were a lot of people here when I woke up and

26:24.540 --> 26:31.540
and then everybody left. And now it's just me and you guys.

26:31.960 --> 26:33.420
Do you feel abandoned? Are you having abandonment issues?

26:33.420 --> 26:36.380
I do. I was planning on, you know...

26:36.380 --> 26:38.260
That precious Amanda, Miklotov, had to go.

26:38.260 --> 26:42.700
Right. I was planning on hanging out with Miklotov as he was doing the show with you

26:42.700 --> 26:43.100
guys.

26:43.100 --> 26:46.820
Well, usually when Miklotov is here on the show, he'll drop in and say hi, and then he

26:46.820 --> 26:49.880
retires out to the living room because he doesn't really want to be on the show.

26:49.880 --> 26:54.460
And we got a new gay channel here, logo, that I was just watching in the other room.

26:54.460 --> 27:00.300
I know, it's super fabulous. And we, they were having a, is that funny?

27:00.300 --> 27:05.780
What are you laughing at over there? Is it the chat room?

27:05.780 --> 27:11.580
No, just the way it's super fabulous. Yeah, I know, he's a big queer.

27:11.580 --> 27:18.920
No I'm not, dude. We went, so I was watching that channel and they have, you know, a lot

27:18.920 --> 27:23.460
of super gay programming on it. Well imagine that. I mean, on the gay channel,

27:23.460 --> 27:24.460
What are you going to have?

27:24.460 --> 27:25.460
You're going to have...

27:25.460 --> 27:26.700
Well, you know, they have Wonder Falls, which isn't totally gay.

27:26.700 --> 27:31.380
Madonna documentaries and, um, I don't know, what else do you show on the channel?

27:31.380 --> 27:37.860
It was actually a reality show based around this gay guy opening a bar for the first time,

27:37.860 --> 27:41.340
called Open Bar, and the guy was fucking hot.

27:41.340 --> 27:43.980
And he was totally hot.

27:43.980 --> 27:50.140
And like, I bet, you know, I bet he has, you know, nice looking balls.

27:50.140 --> 27:51.140
I don't know.

27:51.140 --> 27:52.140
What?

27:52.140 --> 27:53.140
What?

27:53.140 --> 27:57.980
Well, you know, sometimes if you look at a guy, you can tell, okay, that guy has good-looking

27:57.980 --> 27:58.980
balls.

27:58.980 --> 27:59.980
Whoa!

27:59.980 --> 28:01.740
That just came, like, completely out of left field.

28:01.740 --> 28:02.740
What the...

28:02.740 --> 28:07.420
Oh, I like sitting here right now.

28:07.420 --> 28:08.420
You don't know that?

28:08.420 --> 28:12.940
Dark Sakura as a straight woman, do you ever look at a guy and go, I bet that guy has some

28:12.940 --> 28:14.940
nice balls?

28:14.940 --> 28:16.460
Occasionally?

28:16.460 --> 28:19.820
Occasionally?

28:19.820 --> 28:23.100
I'm more like, I hope he shames those.

28:23.100 --> 28:26.780
Yeah. Oh my god. Oh my god. Okay. Oh wow, look at that.

28:26.780 --> 28:31.060
Sometimes Harry is better. Amazing. Look at that. We just lost half our listeners.

28:31.060 --> 28:35.180
Good job. Now we're down to one listener. Wow. Good job.

28:35.180 --> 28:39.180
You lost half your listeners last week. Yes, we went from two to one. Good job.

28:39.180 --> 28:44.380
Good job.

28:44.380 --> 28:47.380
Anyway, so that's how my week was and my day.

28:49.380 --> 28:51.380
That's good to know. Thank you.

28:51.380 --> 28:52.380
No problem.

28:52.380 --> 28:53.380
Your week was balls.

28:53.380 --> 28:55.380
It was hairy balls.

28:55.380 --> 28:57.380
And serenity. Hairy balls and serenity.

29:00.380 --> 29:04.380
Wow, I'm so glad that the show just instantly went down the toilet. That's great.

29:04.380 --> 29:06.380
And Legend of Zaku gets it!

29:06.380 --> 29:08.380
What? What did Legend of Zaku say?

29:08.380 --> 29:13.380
The in-your-mouth line after, didn't you see Jay and Silent Bob strike back?

29:13.380 --> 29:16.940
I did, like, years ago, when it first came out.

Click on Chat if you want to join in the chat fun.

29:25.060 --> 29:26.820
Also, interact with us, the Skype line.

29:26.820 --> 29:28.620
We're going to open that up in a little while, because I know

29:28.620 --> 29:31.220
you guys are dying to give your feedback to Dance Dance

29:31.220 --> 29:32.900
Revolution Extreme 2.

29:32.900 --> 29:34.340
However, what we're going to do now, we're going to go to a

29:34.340 --> 29:36.460
break, and when we come back from this break, we're going

29:36.460 --> 29:39.260
to see if, hopefully, Loki shows up during this break.

29:39.260 --> 29:43.100
But even if not, we're going to talk about the big news

29:43.100 --> 29:46.820
going on in the Bamani scene that I wonder if you guys even know about.

29:46.820 --> 29:48.460
And then we'll talk about the, thank you for that.

29:48.460 --> 29:52.640
We'll also talk about the Dance Dance Revolution Extreme 2 and my thoughts

29:52.640 --> 29:53.940
and hopefully Loki's thoughts.

29:53.940 --> 29:54.900
Enter Asante.

29:54.900 --> 29:56.480
He's here, thank you.

29:56.480 --> 29:58.860
It's almost like having a studio audience where you can have like an

29:58.860 --> 30:02.220
applause sign that lights up.

30:02.220 --> 30:04.260
All right.

30:04.260 --> 30:09.060
In this break, we're going to hear some more music from DER Extreme 2.

30:09.060 --> 30:11.300
We're going to hear Injection of Love.

30:11.300 --> 30:16.340
but this is the version of Injection of Love that has the vocals not in it, so see if you

30:16.340 --> 30:21.100
like this version, a little bit different there because they actually stripped out Sana's

30:21.100 --> 30:26.120
vocals because, controversially, Sana says fuck me in one part of the song where she

30:26.120 --> 30:30.820
says fuck me, although some people are saying, no, she doesn't say fuck me, she's actually

30:30.820 --> 30:35.020
saying suck me or something else. She totally says fuck me. She totally says fuck me, and

30:35.020 --> 30:39.460
even if she's not trying to say fuck me, she says fuck me. So I don't, I don't know if

30:39.460 --> 30:43.620
the lyrics. In fact, let me see. Hold on. I have no problem with those words. God dammit,

30:43.620 --> 30:49.140
y'all got me on a tangent. Let me pull this up real fast here, because I have to prove

30:49.140 --> 30:52.340
something to you people. So for those of you guys that have never heard Injection of Love,

30:52.340 --> 30:55.180
even though we've actually played this quite a bit on our show before this was ever in

30:55.180 --> 31:01.180
DDR Extreme USA, here's a little piece of Injection of Love. And you tell me if this

31:01.180 --> 31:08.180
This doesn't sound like fuck.

31:11.580 --> 31:18.580
A little bit after this part. Let me fast forward a little bit here.

31:24.100 --> 31:27.780
She totally said fuck me right there. Come on. She totally said fuck me.

31:27.780 --> 31:30.360
It's called injection of love.

31:30.360 --> 31:34.640
Of course she said fuck me. Isn't that giving your injection of love?

31:34.640 --> 31:38.600
I'm gonna inject you with my meat rod. No, my love.

31:38.600 --> 31:43.240
My love rod. In other words, my cock.

31:43.240 --> 31:49.760
And in some weird porn way, my balls too. Alright.

31:49.760 --> 31:54.480
So I understand if you guys, I don't know, you probably went on some website and looked

31:54.480 --> 31:58.720
up the official lyrics or something and maybe it's not fuck, but let's face it, if it's

31:58.720 --> 32:04.280
not supposed to be fucked. She did a pretty bad job. She did a Freudian slip. She was

32:04.280 --> 32:10.000
thinking about fucking when she sang it. And so she said, fuck me. There. So.

32:10.000 --> 32:14.200
What does fuck mean? Because, get it, she doesn't say fuck right?

32:14.200 --> 32:19.880
She says fuck. Actually, to me it sounds more like fook me. Like fook me and fook you from,

32:19.880 --> 32:24.840
forget it. Yes, I do. I just wasn't funny. So needless to say, they had to strip out

32:24.840 --> 32:29.640
the vocals because you know they weren't going to do that and well I'm assuming

32:29.640 --> 32:33.000
anyway that that's why they stripped out the vocals is that you know because you

32:33.000 --> 32:36.600
know it awfully it sounds like fuck in the song although in Dance Dance

32:36.600 --> 32:41.080
Revolution Extreme they little they little little fuck slip by and the song

32:41.080 --> 32:45.640
highs off you but it's so hard to catch and that's even more controversial as to

32:45.640 --> 32:50.680
whether they're really saying fucking you up is the lyric so plus I don't know

32:50.680 --> 32:59.700
you know this. I used to think that, what was that one that was in Beatmania? God, now

32:59.700 --> 33:03.840
I can't remember what it was. I always thought that they used to say, often kissed by a boy

33:03.840 --> 33:11.640
band fucker. Oh. Often kissed by a boy band fucker, often kissed by a boy band fucker.

33:11.640 --> 33:18.540
Yeah, that song. I forgot what the song was. I have Wonderland. That was it. Yeah. That

33:18.540 --> 33:21.740
in one of the earlier USDDRs as well as like what third mix like way back when

33:21.740 --> 33:26.460
okay anyway I swear we're gonna get to the song but I just wanted to get that

33:26.460 --> 33:31.660
out there about you know word censorship and all that stuff so here we go

33:31.660 --> 33:35.300
starting off this break the instrumental version or as they're calling it the

33:35.300 --> 33:38.900
Hina mix of injection of love and after this we're gonna hear some inside your

33:38.900 --> 33:45.900
heart, make a difference and my my my, we'll be back after this.

35:08.900 --> 35:31.100
One, two, three, four!

35:31.100 --> 35:38.100
One, two, three, four!

35:38.100 --> 35:59.100
I want you now, my heart's on fire, and so we step, step, step into the love of life.

35:59.100 --> 36:04.100
It's time for your love, I'm watching your love

36:04.100 --> 36:07.100
I know that you'll be there

36:07.100 --> 36:11.100
I'm feeling good, I'm feeling fine

36:11.100 --> 36:16.100
I want you now, I want you now

36:16.100 --> 36:20.100
Don't ever leave, I know you won't

36:20.100 --> 36:25.100
Don't let me go, don't let me go

36:25.100 --> 36:29.060
Baby yeah you love me so much

36:29.700 --> 36:33.580
Baby yeah you're holding my mind

36:34.080 --> 36:36.080
I want you just to hold me

36:36.680 --> 36:38.300
I love that you love me always

36:38.580 --> 36:40.580
I want you just to touch me

36:40.980 --> 36:42.980
I want to see you near me

36:43.260 --> 36:45.260
I want you just to hold me

36:45.620 --> 36:47.260
I love that you love me always

36:47.660 --> 36:49.660
I want you just to touch me

36:49.660 --> 36:52.780
I'd like to feel inside your heart

37:19.660 --> 37:24.660
For your heart, for your dreams, for your heart

37:24.660 --> 37:29.660
For your dreams, for your heart

37:29.660 --> 37:32.660
When a world is lost in itself

37:32.660 --> 37:36.660
And you feel the life is not showing through

37:36.660 --> 37:39.660
And you'll forget it's not by yourself

37:39.660 --> 37:42.660
But you gotta reach and make this one

37:42.660 --> 37:45.660
Let her play, give it a chance

37:45.660 --> 37:48.660
Stand up and stand in front at night

37:49.660 --> 37:52.660
You can work through it to get the chance

37:53.660 --> 37:55.660
We can work from waist to waist

37:55.660 --> 37:58.660
Get up and you can just

38:02.660 --> 38:05.660
Use it at all times

38:05.660 --> 38:07.660
What else can we do?

38:07.660 --> 38:10.660
We can do it now baby, cause I'll be fine

38:10.660 --> 38:13.660
We can do it now baby, cause I'll be fine

38:43.660 --> 38:47.660
Follow your dreams Follow your mind

38:47.660 --> 38:50.660
Follow your world Follow your dreams

38:50.660 --> 38:53.660
Let's do it now for a dream

39:20.660 --> 39:25.080
My, my, my, my How's he ever get this way?

39:25.080 --> 39:30.960
Where's he gonna go?

39:30.960 --> 39:32.960
How's he gonna make this good?

39:32.960 --> 39:34.920
What's the sugar take to do it?

39:34.920 --> 39:40.440
My, my, my, how's he ever get this way?

39:40.440 --> 39:46.440
Where's he gonna go?

39:46.440 --> 39:48.320
How's he gonna make this good?

39:48.320 --> 39:50.320
I'm gonna take the joy

39:50.320 --> 39:53.320
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my

39:53.320 --> 39:55.320
How do you get this one?

39:55.320 --> 39:57.320
Where is the door?

39:57.320 --> 40:00.320
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my

40:00.320 --> 40:02.320
Oh, tell me where you're gonna take it from

40:02.320 --> 40:04.320
We'll do what I think they're doing

40:34.320 --> 41:00.320
Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

41:00.320 --> 41:09.480
We're back here on Orange Lounge Radio. Hope you enjoyed that break of more EX2 music,

41:09.480 --> 41:15.520
including Injection of Love, Inside Your Heart, Make a Difference, and My My My. As a reminder,

41:15.520 --> 41:21.800
tonight's show is filled with Dance Dance Revolution Extreme 2 spoilers, and if you

41:21.800 --> 41:26.600
are afraid of hearing something that might spoil Dance Dance Revolution Extreme 2 for

41:26.600 --> 41:31.920
Let me remind you Dance Dance Revolution Xtreme 2 is not a movie or a story. There is nothing to spoil.

41:33.720 --> 41:37.220
Oh no, we told you a song is in the game. You still have to work to unlock it.

41:38.000 --> 41:43.840
I don't, that's one of those things I kind of don't get quote-unquote on DDR Freak right now, get, putting quotes,

41:43.840 --> 41:46.080
is that everybody in the Xtreme 2 thread is,

41:46.640 --> 41:52.040
and even I had to do this myself because I feared the angry mob if I didn't. They were, you know, putting all the

41:52.240 --> 41:54.800
spoilers in hidden like you have to

41:54.800 --> 41:59.400
highlight with your mouse type text because you know they don't want you

41:59.400 --> 42:03.240
know people are not wanting the game to be spoiled but I'm thinking anybody with

42:03.240 --> 42:07.240
common sense would think if I don't want to spoil this game I probably shouldn't

42:07.240 --> 42:10.920
go on a discussion forum where people were talking about how how much they've

42:10.920 --> 42:13.680
been playing it and how great the game is and all the songs they've been getting

42:13.680 --> 42:17.200
so I'm not I'm not sure I get the point of why we're being so sensitive about

42:17.200 --> 42:24.600
spoilers so whatever maybe somebody will call up and yell at me for spoiling

42:24.600 --> 42:28.600
uh... dancers revolution extreme too but you know what

42:28.600 --> 42:30.200
i warned you

42:30.200 --> 42:31.920
welded

42:31.920 --> 42:34.840
well look he's here he's he's back

42:34.840 --> 42:36.920
yeah doing i'm i'm good fired

42:36.920 --> 42:41.140
no i'm scared i'm not fired i i had top-secret working working on them

42:41.140 --> 42:45.460
and that's going to have to get a sandwich also right that's fine

42:45.460 --> 42:49.400
you're allowed to be late once in a while but don't let it happen again

42:49.400 --> 42:53.760
how you doing how was your week how was your day? um... my week was okay today was kind of

42:53.760 --> 42:59.240
weird because Nellie decided, you know, instead of watching the Food Network today, she wanted

42:59.240 --> 43:07.400
to watch TLC, which, um, they were playing, um, it's like a whole line-up of medical procedures

43:07.400 --> 43:11.440
that could go wrong. Like, for example, they had, um, you know, plastic surgery gone wrong

43:11.440 --> 43:17.000
and then they had another one that was, uh, when medical instruments get left behind,

43:17.000 --> 43:21.240
you know, a whole series of people, oh, look, we left the sponge in you. Oh, look, there's

43:21.240 --> 43:27.240
I'm sorry, but we've replaced your heart with a baked potato. You have five seconds to live.

43:27.240 --> 43:28.240
Exactly.

43:28.240 --> 43:29.240
Oh, sure.

43:29.240 --> 43:33.240
It was just like, you know, I didn't need to be watching that stuff, so. But other than

43:33.240 --> 43:37.920
that, no. Really not too much going on. Except, I don't know, I'm just getting some more games

43:37.920 --> 43:38.920
to sell back.

43:38.920 --> 43:39.920
Right on.

43:39.920 --> 43:42.520
So, I'm clearing out, you know, my excess crap.

43:42.520 --> 43:43.520
Okay. Cool.

43:43.520 --> 43:49.320
What else was I going to ask you about? Oh, actually, I wanted to tell the listeners about

43:49.320 --> 43:53.960
this. Before the break, you missed a little bit of show, obviously, Loki. Luckily you

43:53.960 --> 43:59.920
missed the conversation on balls, because Extrofer got us started talking about balls,

43:59.920 --> 44:04.200
as Extrofer tends to do on this program, bring up something X-rated we shouldn't be talking

44:04.200 --> 44:08.960
about on the internet. But one other thing we were talking about was Injection of Love,

44:08.960 --> 44:13.480
the censored version, quote unquote, that's in DDR Extreme 2, and how they took out the

44:13.480 --> 44:17.680
Fuck Me line by just basically taking out all the vocals. Well, thanks to one of our

44:17.680 --> 44:22.520
our listeners who's listening tonight, who's in our chat room, Color of Sakura, she actually,

44:22.520 --> 44:28.080
or he or she, sorry, actually quoted, sorry, I don't take note of everybody's gender sometimes.

44:28.080 --> 44:35.060
This person actually sent me a picture of the 2DX Red Booklet that actually shows the

44:35.060 --> 44:40.240
lyrics here to Injection of Love, and sure enough, something, something in Japanese,

44:40.240 --> 44:45.440
touch me, something, something, lick me, something, something, stroke me.

44:45.440 --> 44:48.340
She's supposed to be saying, stroke me.

44:48.340 --> 44:52.800
Okay, so keeping that in mind, here we go again, I'm going to play you the vocal version

44:52.800 --> 44:54.940
of Injection of Love, that little piece here.

44:54.940 --> 45:00.220
You tell me, fuck or stroke, you be the judge.

45:00.220 --> 45:14.660
That's clearly an F. That is clearly an F.

45:14.660 --> 45:20.180
that is not stroke me fuck me does not sound like stroke me unless you have some

45:20.180 --> 45:24.300
weird fucking accent that's all I gotta say if she pronounces her S's like F's

45:24.300 --> 45:30.140
like we're gonna go club some baby feels or we're gonna I don't yeah it doesn't

45:30.140 --> 45:33.300
work I'm sorry I don't care what the lyric book says thank you for sharing

45:33.300 --> 45:41.620
the restaurant is down the feet I don't know I do a print I do appreciate you

45:41.620 --> 45:46.180
sharing the lyric book though at least um I know she was drunk if he Oh sauna

45:46.180 --> 45:49.940
sauna because I remember when I was drunk at Dave and Bester's and I called

45:49.940 --> 45:57.780
my food a chili feet steak all right it was a silly cheesesteak

45:57.780 --> 46:04.340
mpq and chat room says a kiriyamoka said stroke but sauna said fuck discussion

46:04.340 --> 46:08.340
over I can agree with that sauna butchered the lyrics to injection of

46:08.340 --> 46:13.180
love. It makes for a good Bimani drama story. And then, of course, naturally that's followed

46:13.180 --> 46:22.180
up. Leave this to our chat room with Sakurina saying, a Kiryamoka must have big balls. You

46:22.180 --> 46:28.340
guys are so immature. All right, anyway. Balls! Shut up. I know you're talking about the drink,

46:28.340 --> 46:35.060
right? All right. Yeah. Balls. Yeah. I want to talk about, I want to talk about Pump It

46:35.060 --> 46:38.060
I want to talk about one more thing too. No, I want to talk about Pump It Up first.

46:38.060 --> 46:39.060
What do you want to talk about?

46:39.060 --> 46:44.060
Okay, so this is the first time I got, well yesterday I got a sandwich at Rayleigh's.

46:44.060 --> 46:45.060
That was okay.

46:45.060 --> 46:48.060
Today I got a sandwich and they were like, what kind of turkey would you want?

46:48.060 --> 46:51.060
I'm like, I thought there was only one kind of turkey, you know?

46:51.060 --> 46:52.060
The bird turkey.

46:52.060 --> 46:57.060
So I am all, I just want that one because it looked like the turkey I normally get.

46:57.060 --> 46:58.060
Well this is salsa turkey.

46:58.060 --> 47:03.060
Now I don't know what the difference is, but it's sort of dipped in salsa.

47:03.060 --> 47:04.060
It's a Mexican turkey?

47:04.060 --> 47:08.140
turkey? I guess. I didn't know there were Mexican turkeys. Is there a lambada turkey

47:08.140 --> 47:14.140
in a... More importantly, is it tasty? Foxtrot? It tastes like salsa, partially. Imagine that.

47:14.140 --> 47:19.860
That doesn't sound yummy. Anyways, go ahead. Oh, thank you. I actually had a music video

47:19.860 --> 47:23.980
game. I don't know if you guys remember, but we did create this show to talk about music

47:23.980 --> 47:29.460
video games. When do I get bored of the game? Pump It Up. I want to talk about Pump It Up.

47:29.460 --> 47:32.160
Huge news in Pump It Up and I don't think

47:32.160 --> 47:36.120
many people notice this. Something was released on Xbox Live for Pump It Up this

47:36.120 --> 47:37.160
week and it's the

47:37.160 --> 47:39.240
Pump It Up Step Chart Editor.

47:39.240 --> 47:43.160
It's something that you download on Xbox Live and when I say download it's

47:43.160 --> 47:47.120
actually very similar to the way the characters in UltraMix 2 were

47:47.120 --> 47:47.800
unlocked

47:47.800 --> 47:51.000
where you're basically downloading a code or something that

47:51.000 --> 47:53.840
unlocks it inside the game because it's only a five block file

47:53.840 --> 47:58.120
and I have a hard time believing that a step editor would fit in five blocks of data.

47:58.120 --> 48:02.160
Um, you download this thing and then you suddenly have a step editor available to you in Pump

48:02.160 --> 48:03.160
It Up.

48:03.160 --> 48:04.160
No big deal, right?

48:04.160 --> 48:05.320
It just puts it up there on the level with DDR.

48:05.320 --> 48:07.460
You can create your own steps to songs.

48:07.460 --> 48:13.560
And in fact, the editor in Pump It Up is a hell of a lot like the DDR editor, but, you

48:13.560 --> 48:15.000
know, with pump arrows.

48:15.000 --> 48:19.400
Um, but here's the really interesting thing that I think might have slipped through some

48:19.400 --> 48:21.300
of the cracks and some people didn't notice.

48:21.300 --> 48:26.720
Not only can you edit the steps to songs in Pump It Up, but you can create brand new step

48:26.720 --> 48:30.280
files to songs loaded on your Xbox hard drive.

48:30.280 --> 48:33.320
You can use the custom soundtrack feature to create

48:33.320 --> 48:36.640
your own arrows to songs that you rip to your hard drive.

48:36.640 --> 48:40.800
So finally, we have this game out there that allows you to

48:40.800 --> 48:44.220
create steps to your own music, which is something

48:44.220 --> 48:46.920
people have been wanting in DDR for a long time.

48:46.920 --> 48:47.880
That's pretty cool.

48:47.880 --> 48:50.080
Licensing issues, of course, make that a nightmare.

48:50.080 --> 48:53.240
Now obviously, you can't really take these files and

48:53.240 --> 48:54.960
send them over the internet to other people.

48:54.960 --> 48:57.960
I imagine there must be a way to do it using an Xbox memory

48:57.960 --> 48:59.060
card, maybe.

48:59.060 --> 49:02.160
I don't know enough about Xbox memory to know if you can

49:02.160 --> 49:04.020
transfer, maybe one of our listeners knows, to know if

49:04.020 --> 49:06.580
you can transfer a soundtrack, quote on quote, something you

49:06.580 --> 49:10.540
rip on the CD, to take something that you rip on the

49:10.540 --> 49:12.740
soundtrack to a memory card.

49:12.740 --> 49:14.340
Obviously, you could take the step file and put it on your

49:14.340 --> 49:16.540
memory card, but I don't know if you could take Soundtracks

49:16.540 --> 49:18.500
and put it on a memory card.

49:18.500 --> 49:21.840
So hypothetically, if you could do that, put the

49:21.840 --> 49:23.780
soundtrack on the memory card and your step file on the

49:23.780 --> 49:28.480
card, you could essentially give these to your friends via the memory card.

49:28.480 --> 49:32.120
And here's the other cool thing about Pump It Up, putting your own songs, your own step

49:32.120 --> 49:38.760
files, it has this preloaded background movie, so your song even has its own background movie,

49:38.760 --> 49:39.760
which is kind of cool.

49:39.760 --> 49:44.320
So, it's just a generic thing with like, you know, one of those rotating cubes and lights

49:44.320 --> 49:45.320
and, you know, it's very...

49:45.320 --> 49:46.880
Is it with the boobies?

49:46.880 --> 49:48.520
It's not the booby law, unfortunately.

49:48.520 --> 49:50.640
It's not the booby law.

49:50.640 --> 49:55.040
But somehow a lot of people didn't notice this.

49:55.040 --> 49:56.880
I mean, it was actually announced on the official

49:56.880 --> 49:58.280
Pump It Up website.

49:58.280 --> 50:00.320
This actually came out on the 29th.

50:00.320 --> 50:03.080
And Miklotov and I were just randomly serving the internet

50:03.080 --> 50:03.480
this morning.

50:03.480 --> 50:04.600
And he was like, wait a minute.

50:04.600 --> 50:06.680
Did you realize that they put this all out there?

50:06.680 --> 50:08.720
So we hooked up Xbox Live.

50:08.720 --> 50:10.800
And sure enough, we just went on and downloaded it.

50:10.800 --> 50:13.820
So if you own Pump It Up Exceed for Xbox, I don't think

50:13.820 --> 50:15.360
this exists in the PS2 version.

50:15.360 --> 50:18.000
This only exists in the Xbox version, as far as I know.

50:18.000 --> 50:18.520
Check it out.

50:18.520 --> 50:20.360
Well, obviously, it wouldn't matter, because PS2 doesn't

50:20.360 --> 50:25.200
you to have custom soundtracks. Check it out. Rip your own music to the Xbox hard drive.

50:25.200 --> 50:31.840
It's very easy to do within the Xbox. In fact, I actually, what I did, I burned a CD from

50:31.840 --> 50:37.960
iTunes and just ripped it on my Xbox, so I have like a mix of music. But I understand

50:37.960 --> 50:42.120
that not all Xboxes will read burned CDs, because from what Mikolatov was telling me,

50:42.120 --> 50:43.120
his Xbox won't read burned CDs.

50:43.120 --> 50:44.400
Ours will either.

50:44.400 --> 50:45.400
That's weird. Mine will.

50:45.400 --> 50:48.240
It also depends on the quality of the CD that you use.

50:48.240 --> 50:54.280
be. He's theorizing this because I have the Halo Xbox, that maybe somehow the drive in

50:54.280 --> 51:00.200
mine is different and it allows it to read the burned disc. I don't know. But that's

51:00.200 --> 51:06.040
one thing. So before you try that, realize that your Xbox may not read the burned thing

51:06.040 --> 51:11.520
and rip it to the custom soundtrack, but I'm hoping you still have some legitimate CDs

51:11.520 --> 51:18.880
in your collection out there, boys and girls, so you can certainly rip those.

51:18.880 --> 51:22.520
Very very interesting.

51:22.520 --> 51:26.480
So I think a lot of people didn't really realize that because I don't think a lot of people

51:26.480 --> 51:30.360
are following what's going on in the Pump It Up scene, but that's what we're here at

51:30.360 --> 51:32.840
Orange Lounge Radio to do, so have fun with that.

51:32.840 --> 51:36.840
Go dig up your copy of Pump It Up and have fun making your own steps there.

51:36.840 --> 51:44.320
be interesting. Oh, somebody in the chat room is actually telling me, Rontan is actually

51:44.320 --> 51:51.640
saying that there are three different types of Xbox drives. So possibly I have one of

51:51.640 --> 51:55.240
the ones that will let you read the burned CDs, whereas the old Xboxes don't do that.

51:55.240 --> 52:00.800
I don't know. Anyway. Now of course a lot of our chat room is using this opportunity

52:00.800 --> 52:07.760
to say, Andamiro wins, Andamiro F'd Konami in the A, Andamiro loves us long time, Andamiro

52:07.760 --> 52:12.480
yay yay yay, and of course I realize this is a feature people have been wanting for

52:12.480 --> 52:21.020
forever, but did Andamiro serve Konami? Is this gonna revolutionize things? I say no.

52:21.020 --> 52:28.080
You know why I say no? Because you can't share these files. There's no easy way. I'm sure

52:28.080 --> 52:33.080
hacker people out there that know how to get to the raw files on the Xbox hard drive and

52:33.080 --> 52:36.040
would therefore be able to rip the files, copy them, and send them over the internet

52:36.040 --> 52:39.760
to somebody else who would know how to load them onto their hard drive. But that's not

52:39.760 --> 52:45.280
the normal Xbox user. So I don't think a lot of people are going to be able to do much

52:45.280 --> 52:50.280
with these custom things they make, and so I don't think it's going to be a widely used

52:50.280 --> 52:53.800
thing. I actually don't, I mean, I don't, it's kind of a bitch to create your own step

52:53.800 --> 52:59.200
file and pump it up, especially from a song because, to put this in perspective, the song,

52:59.200 --> 53:02.920
track number one was Endless Day by Echo Image on my custom soundtrack, so we decided to

53:02.920 --> 53:07.260
try and make a step file of that. Well, not only do you have to figure out the BPM, although

53:07.260 --> 53:11.900
Pump It Up does have a little thing where you can tap the X button on each beat and

53:11.900 --> 53:15.520
it'll calculate what the average beat per minute is you're clicking, so you can kind

53:15.520 --> 53:20.240
of figure out the BPM that way. But the problem is you have to set the delay as well, and

53:20.240 --> 53:24.040
And that was a real bitch for us to figure out the delay, because there was no easy way

53:24.040 --> 53:28.320
for us to, like, there was no press the X button when the song starts type thing, so

53:28.320 --> 53:31.880
we had to actually calculate in time the delay.

53:31.880 --> 53:33.080
So it was kind of a bitch to do.

53:33.080 --> 53:35.800
But once we got it, it was pretty cool.

53:35.800 --> 53:40.640
But I don't know how many people are going to take the time to do that, just to play

53:40.640 --> 53:41.640
their own song.

53:41.640 --> 53:42.640
I don't know.

53:42.640 --> 53:43.900
Maybe I'm underestimating what people want to do out there.

53:43.900 --> 53:47.840
There's a whole Simphile community that has to do it the same way, so...

53:47.840 --> 53:51.840
Yeah, but the thing about the SymFile community is that you can zip those up, send them on the internet very easily.

53:51.840 --> 54:01.840
StepMania practically endorses that kind, I mean, they don't endorse it, I guess, but they thrive on that type of distribution, basically.

54:01.840 --> 54:04.840
Is that, you know, you even have, what, the SM zip file?

54:04.840 --> 54:10.840
You know, an archive file that's specifically made for StepMania, which is the way, what, like FoodMix and stuff was distributed, right?

54:10.840 --> 54:13.840
Yeah, it's just a zip file with some other program that runs it.

54:13.840 --> 54:16.240
basically.

54:16.240 --> 54:18.280
So yeah, it is the same as making a SIM file.

54:18.280 --> 54:20.920
But at the same time, a SIM file is very easy to get out

54:20.920 --> 54:21.840
there and share.

54:21.840 --> 54:24.040
And let's face it, I think that's what motivates people.

54:24.040 --> 54:29.480
It's because people want to share what they've done.

54:29.480 --> 54:32.920
I think one way that this could be improved upon is for

54:32.920 --> 54:37.240
Ann DeMuro to set up a database very similar to what

54:37.240 --> 54:40.680
UltraMix 2 had, where users can submit their own step

54:40.680 --> 54:42.980
files and then share it with each other.

54:42.980 --> 54:43.980
Now the problem is, of course, you

54:43.980 --> 54:45.340
wouldn't be able to share the music because that's

54:45.340 --> 54:46.860
all type of copyright laws.

54:46.860 --> 54:49.620
But if you had maybe like, you say,

54:49.620 --> 54:54.260
this is track one on the latest garbage album or something.

54:54.260 --> 54:55.780
And then, assumably, if everybody

54:55.780 --> 54:59.620
ripped the same track, it would all be the same, right?

54:59.620 --> 55:00.780
I don't know.

55:00.780 --> 55:02.580
Does you kind of understand what I'm saying?

55:02.580 --> 55:03.080
I don't know.

55:03.080 --> 55:04.860
Maybe not so feasible, but it's a way

55:04.860 --> 55:08.020
to do it legally where you could distribute the SIM files.

55:08.020 --> 55:12.080
So go figure.

55:12.080 --> 55:13.480
So I don't know.

55:13.480 --> 55:16.000
I don't really think I'll be really using this feature

55:16.000 --> 55:16.660
for anything else.

55:16.660 --> 55:17.320
I tried it once.

55:17.320 --> 55:17.820
It's cute.

55:17.820 --> 55:20.560
But I don't really want to make my own step files to dance to,

55:20.560 --> 55:23.280
because I'll be able to beat it too easy if I made it.

55:23.280 --> 55:25.720
I don't have Pump It Up.

55:25.720 --> 55:26.520
You should get it.

55:26.520 --> 55:28.840
It's surprisingly good.

55:28.840 --> 55:31.360
I got a free game, though, while Dan was in Texas.

55:31.360 --> 55:32.280
And what's that?

55:32.280 --> 55:34.360
I have Taiko Drum Master.

55:34.360 --> 55:35.320
Oh, Taiko Drum Master.

55:35.320 --> 55:36.560
How's that?

55:36.560 --> 55:39.400
Well, I haven't opened mine yet, but I've played other people's.

55:39.400 --> 55:43.900
I kind of want the Japanese one, just because of the other songs in it.

55:43.900 --> 55:48.760
But he picked up the Red Octane drum thing.

55:48.760 --> 55:52.220
So I'm going to do a comparison of them so that I can talk about it on the show.

55:52.220 --> 55:56.100
I've been hearing from a lot of people that the Red Octane one is highly inferior

55:56.100 --> 56:00.420
to, of course, the official stuff. But then again, that happens with most any.

56:00.420 --> 56:03.520
Right, well I mean when they're trying to sell it cheaper, they're going to use cheaper

56:03.520 --> 56:04.060
parts.

56:04.060 --> 56:07.700
I look at it, it's a cheap knockoff. All their products are cheap knockoffs.

56:07.700 --> 56:11.140
At least it wasn't as bad as the rave disc man.

56:11.140 --> 56:11.940
The what?

56:11.940 --> 56:15.820
The two triangles that were the 2DS controller?

56:15.820 --> 56:20.100
Oh, that.

56:20.100 --> 56:21.260
Very interesting.

56:21.260 --> 56:25.020
All right, um...

56:25.020 --> 56:29.060
Okay, we're going to... I think we're going to open up the Skypoint pretty soon here.

56:29.060 --> 56:31.780
I don't want to go to another break just yet, so I guess we'll go into the next topic.

56:31.780 --> 56:35.540
Let's talk about what's been going on, of course, with DDR Extreme 2.

56:35.540 --> 56:38.060
Now, Loki, have you gotten to play Extreme 2 at all?

56:38.060 --> 56:38.900
Yeah, I haven't.

56:38.900 --> 56:40.780
We haven't really talked about our thoughts on the game yet.

56:40.780 --> 56:43.060
So I'm kind of curious because I want the listeners

56:43.060 --> 56:44.460
to be able to give their feedback when we come back

56:44.460 --> 56:45.940
from the next break on the Skype line.

56:45.940 --> 56:48.000
So we should share what we think of Extreme 2.

56:48.000 --> 56:49.340
So what do you think?

56:49.340 --> 56:50.460
How is Extreme 2?

56:50.460 --> 56:51.180
I like it.

56:51.180 --> 56:53.220
I just got the play up for like one night, though.

56:53.220 --> 56:55.140
Haven't really gotten to play too much of it,

56:55.140 --> 56:58.060
but unlocked like quite a few things.

56:58.060 --> 56:59.780
Yeah, in the dance master mode?

56:59.780 --> 57:00.500
Yeah.

57:00.500 --> 57:01.420
That's pretty cool.

57:01.420 --> 57:03.060
I like the way they're doing that.

57:03.060 --> 57:04.820
The hidden steps that are in there,

57:04.820 --> 57:09.820
So that's kind of a throwback to the old Guitar Freaks, you know, first mix.

57:09.820 --> 57:14.820
I wish they'd do that with the rest of the songs, like, instead of just one step, have a bunch of them in there.

57:14.820 --> 57:16.820
That'd be kind of neat.

57:16.820 --> 57:22.820
Um, and then, just some of the, um, well the characters I couldn't give a crap about.

57:22.820 --> 57:27.820
I think that the fact that they buy their other outfits for like $100,000 is retarded.

57:27.820 --> 57:32.820
I mean, I'm like, hmm, should I buy one outfit or 20 songs?

57:32.820 --> 57:34.820
That's a tough one there.

57:34.820 --> 57:38.820
Yeah, the outfits are something I think you save up for and get later on with the points.

57:38.820 --> 57:41.820
But I do like the whole shop thing and the way you unlock songs that way.

57:41.820 --> 57:46.820
So that way it's like, well, I don't want to unlock that song, so I'm going to save my points and unlock another one.

57:46.820 --> 57:54.820
Exactly. Like, I was pretty much passing up a lot of the stuff that I've had, you know, played to death before in other DDR versions.

57:54.820 --> 58:01.820
Like Air. I didn't bother to buy Air. I already have that in extreme Japan, so I saved up the money and bought Inside Your Heart instead.

58:01.820 --> 58:03.820
kind of interesting, that I could choose to unlock things.

58:03.820 --> 58:07.820
Yeah, about Inside Your Heart and some of those other ones.

58:07.820 --> 58:09.820
Polytary Can't Sing.

58:09.820 --> 58:10.820
That's not Polytary in that song.

58:10.820 --> 58:12.820
Okay, I know that.

58:12.820 --> 58:13.320
Right.

58:13.320 --> 58:13.820
But Polytary Can't Sing.

58:13.820 --> 58:15.320
Oh right, you know, we'll probably hear that.

58:15.320 --> 58:16.320
Which is true.

58:16.320 --> 58:16.820
Yeah.

58:16.820 --> 58:17.320
Polytary Can't.

58:17.320 --> 58:18.320
I'm talking about the new songs that she did.

58:18.320 --> 58:18.820
Passion of Love.

58:18.820 --> 58:19.820
Yeah, Passion of Love.

58:19.820 --> 58:21.320
That was crap.

58:21.320 --> 58:25.820
I was like, oh wow, everything that happened with Orbitribe just like went down the tubes,

58:25.820 --> 58:28.820
just went back to like sucking it up, you know.

58:28.820 --> 58:34.660
I just was amazed at how much she really sucked on the

58:34.660 --> 58:36.380
long gun

58:36.380 --> 58:39.740
I think she's alright on there. I think she's actually pretty good on there.

58:39.740 --> 58:41.820
A woman can't hold a key.

58:41.820 --> 58:43.380
Her teacher should have just

58:43.380 --> 58:48.600
you know, smacked some ability to stay in tune into her, but no.

58:48.600 --> 58:51.840
She was supposed to be professionally trained in my ass.

58:51.840 --> 58:56.660
I can fart in key better than she can sing in key, okay?

58:56.660 --> 58:57.540
Alright.

58:57.540 --> 58:58.540
uh...

58:58.540 --> 59:00.980
well they say that uh...

59:00.980 --> 59:04.740
extreme to you know a lot of people are pitching because sakura and i think i

59:04.740 --> 59:09.180
had their backgrounds changed all while they translated to people can read it

59:09.180 --> 59:11.740
who give the fuck i people are

59:11.740 --> 59:13.300
why

59:13.300 --> 59:15.140
i don't like the shape of the air

59:15.140 --> 59:18.660
it's too well there are no you know it's what you know it's funny on the

59:18.660 --> 59:21.380
background somebody posted on the

59:21.380 --> 59:24.660
freak threat and i apologize i remember who posted that somebody said

59:24.660 --> 59:29.500
Wouldn't it be funny if in UltraMix 3, the banners weren't changed?

59:29.500 --> 59:36.180
FYI guys, Sakura and Daikankai were in the E3 demo of UltraMix 3, and from what I recall,

59:36.180 --> 59:38.420
I would have noticed if they changed those banners.

59:38.420 --> 59:40.740
They didn't change those banners in UltraMix 3.

59:40.740 --> 59:45.100
So unless something changed between E3 and when this game comes out,

59:45.100 --> 59:47.560
whatever that poster said is going to be absolutely right,

59:47.560 --> 59:51.220
where Extreme 2 had their backgrounds changed, and Extreme 3...

59:51.220 --> 59:57.220
It might just, they might, no. Extreme 2 and Ultramix, Extreme 2 had their backgrounds changed and Ultramix 3 did not.

59:57.220 --> 01:00:03.220
Yeah, but the artwork, the artwork for the backgrounds is going to be the last thing. They're, of course, going to use whatever they have at the moment, you know, for the backgrounds.

01:00:03.220 --> 01:00:08.220
So, who gives a crap? I mean, we're talking like, a few pixels here. I mean, who cares?

01:00:08.220 --> 01:00:11.220
So what? It's translated. Big deal. It's an American game now.

01:00:11.220 --> 01:00:16.220
But, she has Sakura tattooed on her face, which makes no sense now. I know.

01:00:16.220 --> 01:00:20.220
Well, it's probably not a tattoo. It's probably just the fucking name of the song.

01:00:20.220 --> 01:00:25.220
If they were going to translate it, they just would have put Cherry.

01:00:25.220 --> 01:00:30.220
I guess that's true. They could have done worse. They could have just given us the English names of the songs.

01:00:30.220 --> 01:00:34.220
Huh? Could have been worse. You know what is interesting about speaking of Sakura?

01:00:34.220 --> 01:00:39.220
I actually haven't gotten to the song yet. I've only been reading fan feedback on DDRFreak.

01:00:39.220 --> 01:00:44.220
But you notice that the background videos are all totally different and extreme too.

01:00:44.220 --> 01:00:49.000
too there's no it looks like they don't use the looping thing anymore like you

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:52.380
know how now you like that you would go like video a for a little bit and then

01:00:52.380 --> 01:00:56.360
video B go to the spinning Beethoven's okay now go to the little plasma looking

01:00:56.360 --> 01:01:00.320
thing they're all their own videos now yeah they're all like all full videos

01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:03.600
now some of them are featuring the looping video stuff but a lot of them

01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:09.600
featured the backgrounds as well like I noticed in happy wedding and irresistible

01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:13.920
lot they were different and what was the other one that really used a lot of

01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:18.640
Well, like, La Copa Da Vida has a lot of soccer themes running through it, and the one that

01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:23.740
Against All Odds is kind of cool, it just has like a very 70s-looking art piece with

01:01:23.740 --> 01:01:28.080
a woman and hair blowing around and stuff, so it's kind of neat.

01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:29.720
I like how they did that with all the different...

01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:30.720
It's a step in the right direction.

01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:31.720
Yeah, it's cool.

01:01:31.720 --> 01:01:32.720
It's cool.

01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:35.580
It's very interesting that only one song in the whole game has, well, at least that I've

01:01:35.580 --> 01:01:39.440
gotten to so far, but I haven't heard of any others, one song in the whole game has an

01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:43.880
actual music video and that's Get Busy which is probably one of the most

01:01:43.880 --> 01:01:49.040
well, one of my least favorite songs to play in DDR. Let's put it that way.

01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:52.680
Not a big Get Busy fan. You know what song that is, right? The reggae one?

01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:57.360
Not a big fan of Get Busy.

01:01:57.360 --> 01:02:01.800
Interesting point though, reading in our chat room over at OrangeLunchRadio.com

01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:02.420
click on chat

01:02:02.420 --> 01:02:05.480
Sakurina says, why did they do that though? Because Kakumei

01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:09.680
was left as is. So why did they change this but not that?

01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:13.880
I don't know. Interesting thought. Who cares?

01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:17.120
Why are you guys putting this much thought into it? Who cares?

01:02:17.120 --> 01:02:22.120
My thoughts on Extreme- It's not tattooed

01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:26.000
on her fucking face, it's just the logo

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:30.160
that happens to be on her face. Doesn't mean it's tattooed on her face

01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:33.320
because who the hell would tattoo a word on their face? That's retarded.

01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:51.320
I honestly think that they should have left it as Kanji, because with any sort of sense of logic would assume that if you're playing a song with a Japanese title and you see Kanji, that typically it's probably going to be the same thing. So, duh!

01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:52.320
I know, I know.

01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:55.320
There has to be somebody pretty stupid in their localization department at Konami.

01:02:55.320 --> 01:03:05.320
Snare has a comment there, Palavastian Dances and Chorus has its own full music video too.

01:03:05.320 --> 01:03:14.320
I say that's kind of borderline because that's a Konami original and all the video is clips from the game that that song is featured in, which is Oz.

01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:20.320
And Oz, from what I understand, isn't actually going to be coming out here. It's only going to be a Japanese release, I think. I don't remember.

01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:27.320
It's very interesting that this is the first mix that they've released that isn't an arcade port, basically.

01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:34.320
So, it kind of has its own video, I guess, although I think it's what game footage would it be.

01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:37.320
Nah, it's like CG footage. It's like cutscenes, maybe.

01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:39.320
Well, yeah, cutscenes stuff. That's what I meant.

01:03:39.320 --> 01:03:43.320
Let's see. My thoughts on Extreme 2.

01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:48.700
Jeez, it's very interesting that this is the first mix that they've released that isn't

01:03:48.700 --> 01:03:51.460
an arcade port, basically.

01:03:51.460 --> 01:03:58.620
Like even when you look at Extreme, the last one they released here in the US, Extreme,

01:03:58.620 --> 01:04:02.300
even though they radically changed the interface and everything, I think for a lot of people

01:04:02.300 --> 01:04:07.940
it was still our version of the port of the Extreme arcade mix, right?

01:04:07.940 --> 01:04:12.760
So this is really the first game where there's been no arcade mix to base it off of.

01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:20.020
So you really, I think, see that evolution from a game that is a translation of an arcade

01:04:20.020 --> 01:04:27.100
game for the home mixes, to a game that is specifically made to be played on a home mix.

01:04:27.100 --> 01:04:31.480
And I think that's why it centers so strongly around Dance Master Mode, because that's a

01:04:31.480 --> 01:04:38.360
very single-player, adventure, conquest type, here's a goal, a long-term goal to get from

01:04:38.360 --> 01:04:41.560
point A to point B that you can't really do in an arcade game.

01:04:41.560 --> 01:04:44.560
So I think it's really interesting to kind of see that transition now from...

01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:50.480
I think this is really the first true transition that we see from DDR as an arcade series to

01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:54.200
now DDR as a home series with Dance Master Mode.

01:04:54.200 --> 01:04:56.900
So is that a good thing or a bad thing for the series?

01:04:56.900 --> 01:04:57.900
I don't know.

01:04:57.900 --> 01:05:03.520
I mean, they kept an arcade-like thing in there still by having the free mode, which,

01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:07.760
you know, basically has the look and feel of a DDR arcade game, but it's just very interesting

01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:11.140
that now the focus is on Dance Master Mode, because if you don't play through Dance Master

01:05:11.140 --> 01:05:14.700
mode, you're not going to really unlock a lot of songs. So I thought it was very interesting

01:05:14.700 --> 01:05:23.820
that the only songs that are available at the outset is the licensed songs. So, and

01:05:23.820 --> 01:05:28.900
I guess that's a lot of the songs that somebody who doesn't really follow DDR or play a lot

01:05:28.900 --> 01:05:32.760
of DDR, those would be the songs that, you know, they would get a kick out of. So that's

01:05:32.760 --> 01:05:36.760
why that's the initial song list, I'm pretty sure. And it's like all these Konami originals

01:05:36.760 --> 01:05:40.340
that are hidden in there are just kind of like bonuses for the hardcore people that

01:05:40.340 --> 01:05:42.300
that are willing to play through Dance Master Mode.

01:05:42.300 --> 01:05:43.860
So it's very interesting.

01:05:43.860 --> 01:05:46.460
But I have heard comments from casual players of DDR

01:05:46.460 --> 01:05:49.260
that's like, boy, there's really not many songs in this.

01:05:49.260 --> 01:05:50.220
And then I'm like, well, you've got

01:05:50.220 --> 01:05:51.640
to play through Dance Master Mode.

01:05:51.640 --> 01:05:54.140
And they're like, oh, I just wanted to get in there

01:05:54.140 --> 01:05:55.820
and go into workout mode.

01:05:55.820 --> 01:05:59.540
So very interesting.

01:05:59.540 --> 01:06:03.540
So I like the game.

01:06:03.540 --> 01:06:04.780
It's cool.

01:06:04.780 --> 01:06:06.520
It's just different.

01:06:06.520 --> 01:06:08.260
It's a different direction for the series.

01:06:08.260 --> 01:06:09.700
I think I like it, though.

01:06:09.700 --> 01:06:13.780
somebody who's a DDR fan. If I was somebody who was buying DDR mixes just to have house

01:06:13.780 --> 01:06:18.220
parties though, I'd be kind of ticked off at this mix because it's not, there's not

01:06:18.220 --> 01:06:22.580
a lot to it. If you just buy it to play it once in a while, you know, let's get drunk

01:06:22.580 --> 01:06:27.660
and play DDR. I'd probably be a little irritated with it because there's not a lot of songs

01:06:27.660 --> 01:06:28.660
to choose from.

01:06:28.660 --> 01:06:32.780
But even though I'd say the casual person doesn't like playing, you know, all the stuff,

01:06:32.780 --> 01:06:39.620
I'm sure that they're not that great at DDR. You can play through the, you know, the Mission

01:06:39.620 --> 01:06:42.460
mode type stuff you know and you can actually it starts off you know

01:06:42.460 --> 01:06:47.620
beginner stuff and goes all the way to really hard so now there you go you can

01:06:47.620 --> 01:06:51.060
get better yeah that's true the dance master mode is kind of a way for you to

01:06:51.060 --> 01:06:56.060
get better it actually reminded me a lot of 2dx what the hell they call that in

01:06:56.060 --> 01:07:01.780
2dx the real mode trial mode drill drill mode thank you drill mode in 2d x6 style

01:07:01.780 --> 01:07:04.580
they have that drill mode and I think it was in fifth style as well where you

01:07:04.580 --> 01:07:08.500
could you it was like you know play these little sections of songs and meet

01:07:08.500 --> 01:07:11.820
these certain qualifications like it's kind of like they took drill mode and

01:07:11.820 --> 01:07:15.740
and really changed it and drill mode really helped me get better at 2dx it

01:07:15.740 --> 01:07:19.460
really did so it would be very interesting that this dance master mode

01:07:19.460 --> 01:07:25.100
could really get you better at DDR but it's still kind of weird to have all the

01:07:25.100 --> 01:07:31.100
unlocks only available by playing the dance master mode to death I mean I

01:07:31.100 --> 01:07:34.900
there's rumors that there's time releases as well but I don't know I

01:07:34.900 --> 01:07:41.900
I don't know. No. I do like the, um, Hidden Roads and stuff like that. Those are pretty cool. Yeah. We're gonna have to find them. Yeah.

01:07:41.900 --> 01:07:49.900
I like Spider Stomp. I'm sorry, I haven't played it. I wish I could contribute more to that. That's alright.

01:07:49.900 --> 01:07:55.900
Well, you could maybe borrow my copy later this week or something if you wanna check it out. I don't know when I would play it.

01:07:55.900 --> 01:08:00.900
Spider Stomp is an excellent game. Just, there's no music, so. It sucks.

01:08:00.900 --> 01:08:04.900
I have Puyo Puyo to keep me happy on the maim, so.

01:08:04.900 --> 01:08:09.900
But I'm gonna, um, we're, uh, discussing, though, buying a DDR machine.

01:08:09.900 --> 01:08:13.900
Speaking of which, um, I'm not sure if you saw that I posted,

01:08:13.900 --> 01:08:19.900
I went and opted to get the correct popping music buttons for my popping music controller,

01:08:19.900 --> 01:08:21.900
so they're gonna be arcade-style.

01:08:21.900 --> 01:08:22.900
Very cool.

01:08:22.900 --> 01:08:25.900
Can't wait for that to be done.

01:08:25.900 --> 01:08:29.900
I wanna try to build one for myself, like, so that I can actually play on something other than the dinky pad.

01:08:29.900 --> 01:08:37.860
that would be easy just the buttons are like 70 bucks cheaper than 400 yeah yeah

01:08:37.860 --> 01:08:43.780
you show me how to I'll do it there's a fact I'll email it okay all right we're

01:08:43.780 --> 01:08:45.940

I don't want to be into you all the time, my baby

I'll find you free, free

01:15:19.480 --> 01:15:23.480
Yeah, I want a sense of love

01:15:23.480 --> 01:15:26.480
And I want it to be there

01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:28.480
I'll get to know you

01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:32.480
When my making me suspect

01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:34.480
Oh

01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:32.100
Okay, we're back here on Orange Lawns Radio.

01:16:32.100 --> 01:16:35.980
people remind me in the future not to reset the router while we're trying to

01:16:35.980 --> 01:16:40.980
broadcast so that Loki can get on our wireless network with the PSP. My bad, my

01:16:40.980 --> 01:16:45.340
bad kids. So since that was kind of my bad and I dropped a lot of you guys

01:16:45.340 --> 01:16:50.340
during the song that like everybody in chat was like OMG waiting for, here it is

01:16:50.340 --> 01:16:57.340
once again one more time seduction

01:17:50.340 --> 01:17:52.340
Hey

01:18:20.340 --> 01:18:40.180
Hello, kids, we're back. Okay, stop complaining, you got to hear a seduction. My bad, people.

01:18:40.180 --> 01:18:46.220
God, we all make mistakes. Some of us more than others, granted, but we all make mistakes.

01:18:46.220 --> 01:18:50.580
Anyway, I'm looking at this really cool new thing that

01:18:50.580 --> 01:18:53.020
Loki was a big part of putting together along with one of our

01:18:53.020 --> 01:18:56.900
other behind-the-scenes people, VX JasonXV, and it's

01:18:56.900 --> 01:18:57.980
very pretty.

01:18:57.980 --> 01:18:59.380
And I think we're going to announce it tonight on the

01:18:59.380 --> 01:19:02.860
podcast. I just have to check with Jason to make sure

01:19:02.860 --> 01:19:04.020
everything's good to go.

01:19:04.020 --> 01:19:04.420
Yeah?

01:19:04.420 --> 01:19:04.860
Yeah.

01:19:04.860 --> 01:19:05.660
So that's exciting.

01:19:05.660 --> 01:19:08.420

01:19:08.420 --> 01:19:10.380

01:19:20.160 --> 01:19:22.480
submitted the winning haiku that's going to win the copy

01:19:22.480 --> 01:19:25.240
of In the Groove that was autographed by all of us.

01:19:25.240 --> 01:19:26.600
And?

01:19:26.600 --> 01:19:27.760
And who?

01:19:27.760 --> 01:19:29.040
And where's Roto?

01:19:29.040 --> 01:19:29.360
No.

01:19:29.360 --> 01:19:32.440
And the added bonus, which I picked up last minute.

01:19:32.440 --> 01:19:33.000
Oh, really?

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:36.180
That was the brand new t-shirt, which says, in the

01:19:36.180 --> 01:19:36.880
courtroom.

01:19:36.880 --> 01:19:38.320
Oh, did you get that?

01:19:38.320 --> 01:19:42.840
I got one for myself and one for the winner.

01:19:42.840 --> 01:19:44.040
Wow, awesome.

01:19:44.040 --> 01:19:47.320
So somebody is going to win an In The Courtroom shirt, which is...

01:19:47.320 --> 01:19:48.320
What is this?

01:19:48.320 --> 01:19:50.200
It's the In The Groove logo, but it says In The Courtroom.

01:19:50.200 --> 01:19:51.200
In The Courtroom.

01:19:51.200 --> 01:19:52.200
That's beautiful.

01:19:52.200 --> 01:19:53.640
All right.

01:19:53.640 --> 01:19:55.300
So check that out.

01:19:55.300 --> 01:19:59.700
So somebody's going to win the In The Groove thing and the In The Courtroom t-shirt.

01:19:59.700 --> 01:20:03.560
And also, Miklotov wanted to throw some prizes in as well.

01:20:03.560 --> 01:20:04.900
Silent Hill 3 stickers.

01:20:04.900 --> 01:20:07.880
We're going to send the winner a Silent Hill 3 sticker.

01:20:07.880 --> 01:20:12.480
Not only the winner, the person who wins the In The Groove haiku contest, but also we're

01:20:12.480 --> 01:20:16.440
we're going to send that to the people that won. Fireboma won one of our V-rares, or two

01:20:16.440 --> 01:20:20.200
of our V-rares last week. He won an Extreme 2V-rare and a Max 2V-rare. He's going to actually

01:20:20.200 --> 01:20:25.120
get a Silent Hill 3 sticker as well, and whoever we draw tonight on the podcast is going to

01:20:25.120 --> 01:20:29.820
get a sticker as well. And Miklotov gave us like 10 stickers, so we're going to just give

01:20:29.820 --> 01:20:33.960
them all away with other prizes that we give out later on throughout this month.

01:20:33.960 --> 01:20:37.820
I'm thinking there will be another contest to go with the announcement that we'll make

01:20:37.820 --> 01:20:39.360
on the podcast later as well.

01:20:39.360 --> 01:20:43.140
Super! We got tons of giveaway crap going on. I love it.

01:20:43.140 --> 01:20:46.300
Cleaning house. I love it. We're going to give away stuff. Let's give away the ferret.

01:20:46.300 --> 01:20:50.300
No, no, no. We already gave away a ferret. And there was like three other ones.

01:20:50.300 --> 01:20:54.060
Oh, did we throw them all away? Ferret. Hidden.

01:20:54.060 --> 01:20:57.940
I don't know, yeah. Anyways, they're in my butt.

01:20:57.940 --> 01:21:01.740
Alright, Skypline's open and people are already hammering us on the Skypline, so

01:21:01.740 --> 01:21:03.460
if you want to call, head on over to

01:21:03.460 --> 01:21:06.960
orangelandradio.com and click on interact with us and we'll go to our first call.

01:21:06.960 --> 01:21:07.940
Hello!

01:21:07.940 --> 01:21:09.500
You're on Orange Launch Radio.

01:21:09.500 --> 01:21:14.060
Hello, Sephiroth1215 here. Hello, Sephiroth1215, what's on your mind?

01:21:14.060 --> 01:21:17.100
Uh, basically just extreme too, but uh...

01:21:17.100 --> 01:21:19.100
My first thought...

01:21:19.100 --> 01:21:20.940
My first thought was like,

01:21:20.940 --> 01:21:24.540
why was I playing in the groove over the summer?

01:21:24.540 --> 01:21:25.980
I don't know, why?

01:21:25.980 --> 01:21:32.980
Well, I don't know, it just kind of revives the DDR back for me at least.

01:21:35.020 --> 01:21:37.620
Except for the arcades of course, but still.

01:21:37.620 --> 01:21:43.260
Well, you know, I'm the one out of the three of us that doesn't hate on In the Groove

01:21:43.260 --> 01:21:46.720
as much. You know, In the Groove for me was exactly

01:21:46.720 --> 01:21:50.720
like you were kind of referring to here. In the Groove was holding me over between

01:21:50.720 --> 01:21:53.800
real DDR. It's kind of how I felt about In the Groove.

01:21:53.800 --> 01:21:58.760
It's kind of like, well, this is, you know, it's like, it's, it's, I can't believe it's

01:21:58.760 --> 01:22:01.480
not DDR. But, you know, it worked for me, and it kind

01:22:01.480 --> 01:22:04.240
of held me over. So I don't fault anybody for getting in In

01:22:04.240 --> 01:22:05.780
the Groove or whatever. And you know what?

01:22:05.780 --> 01:22:09.040
Even after this, there's still going to be people that are more into In The Groove than

01:22:09.040 --> 01:22:11.040
they are DDR, and you know, that's just fine.

01:22:11.040 --> 01:22:18.880
If you are into running in place for 13 Arrow songs and stuff, hey, hats off to you.

01:22:18.880 --> 01:22:23.200
But unfortunately, my personal opinion of In The Groove, and this is my personal opinion

01:22:23.200 --> 01:22:28.160
and whatever, is that unfortunately I think In The Groove was so damn busy making hard

01:22:28.160 --> 01:22:33.560
steps to their songs that they didn't license any good music.

01:22:33.560 --> 01:22:39.320
And to look at DDR Extreme 2's song list, which is pretty phenomenal and really sucks

01:22:39.320 --> 01:22:44.220
the fans' collective cock in every way, I mean honestly, every fan bitching that was

01:22:44.220 --> 01:22:47.700
going on on DDR Freak was really granted with this mix.

01:22:47.700 --> 01:22:51.480
Maybe not everything, but let's face it, the people that were whining and bitching that

01:22:51.480 --> 01:22:53.640
they never got Erotic, they got it.

01:22:53.640 --> 01:22:56.000
The people that were whining and bitching that they were never going to get Cartoon

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:57.440
Heroes, they got it.

01:22:57.440 --> 01:23:01.040
The people that were bitching they were never going to get Sakura and Daikonkai, they got

01:23:01.040 --> 01:23:06.920
got it. I'll be a little bit butchered, but they got it. So this mix really delivered

01:23:06.920 --> 01:23:12.840
to the fans in every way, I think. I don't know. I'm sorry, it's your call, not my monologue.

01:23:12.840 --> 01:23:18.040
I keep cutting you off. What are your other thoughts on Extreme?

01:23:18.040 --> 01:23:22.480
Well, first of all, yeah. I was really pissed about the Injection of Love thing. Because

01:23:22.480 --> 01:23:27.320
it came up randomly and I was happy, I was excited. I'm like, oh, what's Hina mean? And

01:23:27.320 --> 01:23:31.320
all the lyrics are just gone, which has kind of ruined the song.

01:23:31.320 --> 01:23:35.320
I like how, I think somebody on Freak put it this way, is that somebody said,

01:23:35.320 --> 01:23:39.320
imagine you've never heard the 2DX Red version, and I realize it's hard to do

01:23:39.320 --> 01:23:43.320
because you have heard the 2DX Red version, but imagine for a minute you haven't heard the 2DX Red version,

01:23:43.320 --> 01:23:47.320
as a standalone song, it's not that bad.

01:23:47.320 --> 01:23:51.320
There's been worse songs in DDR, although I agree it's a little disappointing for the

01:23:51.320 --> 01:23:55.320
lyrics to be cut out of the song, but, you know, there's, all I can tell you is that there's

01:23:55.320 --> 01:23:59.280
a reason for everything so there's probably a really good reason why it

01:23:59.280 --> 01:24:03.440
turned out the way it did. Well if it's a reason for censoring I think it's poor

01:24:03.440 --> 01:24:08.440
because some of the other songs they're like get busy or even the erotic song I

01:24:08.440 --> 01:24:12.320
mean I thought they weren't gonna censor anything after that since they got an E10 rating. Think of it

01:24:12.320 --> 01:24:16.000
this way though maybe it wasn't done for censoring everybody's assuming it was

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:23.640
done for censoring but what if it wasn't? We don't really know so just

01:24:23.640 --> 01:24:29.400
I'm just hoping maybe I'll put in like UltraMix 3 or something, since they're probably better

01:24:29.400 --> 01:24:30.400
on that.

01:24:30.400 --> 01:24:35.080
Which kind of reminds me, the Quest Mode in UltraMix 3 is probably going to be similar

01:24:35.080 --> 01:24:37.200
in some sort to this Mission Mode.

01:24:37.200 --> 01:24:41.560
I was kind of wondering, I kind of thought about that too, that you know, I'm wondering

01:24:41.560 --> 01:24:45.480
if the Quest Mode in UltraMix 3 is going to be the very central part of the game, such

01:24:45.480 --> 01:24:52.480
as Dance Master Mode was in this Dance Dance Extreme 2, but I don't think it will be, because

01:24:52.480 --> 01:24:57.240
honestly from what I played at E3, and granted, a lot can change from E3 to the home release

01:24:57.240 --> 01:25:04.200
because UltraMix II at last year's E3 sucked humongous, hairy, extra-for-love-and-balls,

01:25:04.200 --> 01:25:13.040
okay? But the version that they ended up releasing is probably one of the best DDR mixes that

01:25:13.040 --> 01:25:17.340
they've ever put out, and in my opinion, I think the song list in UltraMix II is better

01:25:17.340 --> 01:25:20.960
than Extreme II's, but I realize, you know, not everybody shares the same opinion. But

01:25:20.960 --> 01:25:24.660
but Ultramix 2 is phenomenal when they released it. But, Ultramix 3 at E3 this year, I can

01:25:24.660 --> 01:25:28.340
tell you, really didn't feel that much different from Ultramix 2. It was just Ultramix 2 with

01:25:28.340 --> 01:25:32.820
new songs thrown in, and hey, this new little quest mode. So, I don't know.

01:25:32.820 --> 01:25:39.420
Well yeah, I think it was explained before, is quest mode is probably going to be like

01:25:39.420 --> 01:25:43.780
that mode in Virtua Fighter IV Evolution. Where you just go around different arcades

01:25:43.780 --> 01:25:49.260
and fight people. Virtual Fighter IV Evolution, I didn't really

01:25:49.260 --> 01:25:52.260
I didn't really play the Virtua Fighter. Oh, Jamie's making the gag face. I didn't really play Virtua Fighter.

01:25:52.260 --> 01:25:54.260
I hate Virtua Fighter.

01:25:54.260 --> 01:25:58.260
Oh. Sorry, we don't catch the reference because I don't really play a lot of fighting games.

01:25:58.260 --> 01:26:01.260
I saw it. It was pretty, but I don't like Virtua Fighter.

01:26:01.260 --> 01:26:03.260
What was the last fighting game I really liked? Oh, Capcom vs. SNK 2.

01:26:03.260 --> 01:26:05.260
Tekken 5.

01:26:05.260 --> 01:26:07.260
Tekken was okay.

01:26:07.260 --> 01:26:13.260
Anyway, I need to get to some other calls, but do you have any other thoughts on DDR Extreme 2?

01:26:13.260 --> 01:26:16.260
Not really. I think most people should buy it now.

01:26:16.260 --> 01:26:19.260
If you're a fan of DDR, you need to have this game, period.

01:26:19.260 --> 01:26:22.260
If you're a fan of music games, you need to have this game, period.

01:26:22.260 --> 01:26:26.260
If you're a casual, hey, I like to play DDR when I'm drunk,

01:26:26.260 --> 01:26:29.260
you're probably not listening to this show, for one.

01:26:29.260 --> 01:26:33.260
But if that does happen to be you, you may not be so into this mix.

01:26:33.260 --> 01:26:35.260
I would recommend if you're going to start somewhere,

01:26:35.260 --> 01:26:37.260
like if you're a brand new, I'm brand new to DDR,

01:26:37.260 --> 01:26:39.260
I want to start somewhere in the series,

01:26:39.260 --> 01:26:42.260
I actually think Max 2 is the place to start for me.

01:26:42.260 --> 01:26:51.260
but I don't know, it's a toss up. It's tough. One other thing I want to ask you, Sephiroth1215,

01:26:51.260 --> 01:26:54.300
what do you think about the Pump It Up custom soundtrack feature?

01:26:54.300 --> 01:27:02.460
All right, I guess it's okay. I mean, it's not something I would probably use, but I

01:27:02.460 --> 01:27:08.740
mean, still, there's still a possibility it's going to be the next UltraMix, or even so.

01:27:08.740 --> 01:27:14.660
I mean, they said the 360, if it goes onto the 360, every 360 game is going to use the

01:27:14.660 --> 01:27:17.900
custom soundtrack feature. So I'm sure they're going to have to throw it in somehow.

01:27:17.900 --> 01:27:21.020
Really? I didn't know about that, that every game was supposed to use the custom soundtrack

01:27:21.020 --> 01:27:26.820
feature. That's going to be kind of cool. Okay. Well, we'll see. I don't see how we

01:27:26.820 --> 01:27:32.580
can't, if DDR is selling as well as everybody says it is, I say UltraMix or some version

01:27:32.580 --> 01:27:41.660
of Xbox DDR on the 360 is inevitable. So maybe Konami now has something to dare to achieve

01:27:41.660 --> 01:27:43.780
in their Xbox series. Who knows? We'll see.

01:27:43.780 --> 01:27:49.660
Alright, well we're going to let you go. I'm going to get to another call, but have a good

01:27:49.660 --> 01:27:50.660
night and thanks for calling, alright?

01:27:50.660 --> 01:27:51.660
Alright, you too.

01:27:51.660 --> 01:27:52.660
Alright, take care.

01:27:52.660 --> 01:27:53.660
Bye.

01:27:53.660 --> 01:27:54.660
Bye-bye.

01:27:54.660 --> 01:27:59.060
Let's go to another call. Is it loud enough in the studio for you, Dorksucker, or do I

01:27:59.060 --> 01:28:00.060
need to turn it up a little bit?

01:28:00.060 --> 01:28:01.060
I couldn't hear it.

01:28:01.060 --> 01:28:02.060
I'm sorry.

01:28:02.060 --> 01:28:05.820
a little let me turn it up a little bit for you. Alright, let's go to another call. I'm

01:28:05.820 --> 01:28:10.700
going to take, I don't think we've heard from this one in a while. Hello, you're on Orange

01:28:10.700 --> 01:28:18.020
Lawn's radio. Hello. Hello, yes, you're on Orange Lawn's radio. Hey, this is Dark Knight.

01:28:18.020 --> 01:28:27.260
Hey, Dark Knight, how you doing? Hello. Hey. What about the online mode on DDR EX2? Yeah,

01:28:27.260 --> 01:28:30.220
we didn't talk a lot about online mode. I haven't played a whole lot of it, but what's

01:28:30.220 --> 01:28:31.220
What's up?

01:28:31.220 --> 01:28:32.220
I tried it.

01:28:32.220 --> 01:28:38.220
It has a major flaw, and that is you cannot pick your opponent, nor can you pick the song

01:28:38.220 --> 01:28:41.820
to play against, to play against with them.

01:28:41.820 --> 01:28:42.820
That's kind of weird.

01:28:42.820 --> 01:28:47.700
I mean, I guess, yeah, it's kind of one of those things where, well, it's DDR's first

01:28:47.700 --> 01:28:53.740
adventures into the PlayStation Online realm, which, from what I understand, is just not,

01:28:53.740 --> 01:28:58.940
well, you know, from a player perspective, the Sony Online network is just not as good

01:28:58.940 --> 01:28:59.940
as Xbox Live.

01:28:59.940 --> 01:29:03.180
I mean, it's just not as set up as well as Xbox Live is.

01:29:03.180 --> 01:29:05.820
So I'm kind of not surprised that the online features aren't as good.

01:29:05.820 --> 01:29:09.740
But yeah, that is kind of weird that you can't even pick your song, of all things.

01:29:09.740 --> 01:29:11.220
Yeah, but I mean, it was OK.

01:29:11.220 --> 01:29:12.900
But as far as the game play went, it was all right.

01:29:12.900 --> 01:29:14.180
It was pretty synced up.

01:29:14.180 --> 01:29:15.340
Really?

01:29:15.340 --> 01:29:17.940
Yeah, it was pretty synced up when I played my match.

01:29:17.940 --> 01:29:19.460
It was synced with the song I was playing.

01:29:19.460 --> 01:29:22.820
I'm going to have to get on there and kick some ass on DER.

01:29:22.820 --> 01:29:26.540
Can you tell if people are using a controller or not?

01:29:26.540 --> 01:29:28.300
No, you really can't.

01:29:28.300 --> 01:29:28.800
Excellent.

01:29:28.800 --> 01:29:29.800
I'm a button, button master.

01:29:29.800 --> 01:29:30.800
I'm going to get on there and kick some butt.

01:29:30.800 --> 01:29:39.800
I think I'll play against somebody and keep playing on Heavy, and I killed him.

01:29:39.800 --> 01:29:40.800
Awesome.

01:29:40.800 --> 01:29:46.800
See, I feel kind of bad for admitting to that, but at the same time, you know they're all

01:29:46.800 --> 01:29:48.400
playing on controller.

01:29:48.400 --> 01:29:50.280
You know they're all...

01:29:50.280 --> 01:29:54.400
Maybe there's one or two guys out there playing on a dance pad on Heavy, and props to you

01:29:54.400 --> 01:29:57.880
guys for having the guts to do it, but come on.

01:29:57.880 --> 01:30:02.640
all playing on controller. Especially on the soft pad, that's impossible to play heavy

01:30:02.640 --> 01:30:07.340
on the soft pad. It is. That's my problem is that honestly it's too hard to play. When

01:30:07.340 --> 01:30:11.660
you're playing for ranking as well, certainly, I have this problem on Xbox Live as well is

01:30:11.660 --> 01:30:16.860
that I have a really hard time playing heavy matches on a dance pad because I have problems

01:30:16.860 --> 01:30:23.220
hitting my down arrow a lot of times. So I do not like playing heavy songs. I will still

01:30:23.220 --> 01:30:27.300
play light and standard songs on a dance pad against someone on a controller

01:30:27.300 --> 01:30:31.020
because on Xbox you can see what they're using. But if they're using a control...

01:30:31.020 --> 01:30:36.740
whoa we just had a major net split on IRC and I think I split from the rest of

01:30:36.740 --> 01:30:39.620
the chat room but hopefully they'll reconnect soon. Anyway just want to give

01:30:39.620 --> 01:30:44.900
that update. Yeah I mean like I said I mean other than that the normal mode

01:30:44.900 --> 01:30:48.860
yeah there's match mode pretty good fast way to open the songs a little more

01:30:48.860 --> 01:30:55.460
quicker. But at the same time though, it depends on the player's skill on a home pad because

01:30:55.460 --> 01:31:01.100
right now I'm just working on the B-chords right now. I ain't even hit the hard levels

01:31:01.100 --> 01:31:02.100
yet.

01:31:02.100 --> 01:31:06.260
I've actually been pretty good about sticking to playing Dance Master mode strictly on a

01:31:06.260 --> 01:31:11.440
dance pad because I want to get back into actively playing DDR. When I say actively

01:31:11.440 --> 01:31:16.120
meaning like I'm actually exercising by doing it, what little I will be able to exercise

01:31:16.120 --> 01:31:20.300
playing DDR, so I've been actually doing it on the S-FAB, but even there's that one

01:31:20.300 --> 01:31:24.540
occasional mission that I just cannot do without the controller, and those are, the

01:31:24.540 --> 01:31:27.820
one for me that I have to use a controller for is the one where, and you

01:31:27.820 --> 01:31:30.580
probably haven't seen these yet, but you'll see these when you get into D, is

01:31:30.580 --> 01:31:36.420
that there'll be some missions that say, step on a hundred and fifty arrows, but

01:31:36.420 --> 01:31:41.220
not any of the arrows that are actually in the step chart. If you step on one of

01:31:41.220 --> 01:31:44.140
them, if you step on one of the arrows that are actually in the step chart, you

01:31:44.140 --> 01:31:49.300
lose I think it's one somebody said I think so get FAQ say if you step on the

01:31:49.300 --> 01:31:53.740
down arrows you will fail there's another yes there's another mission like

01:31:53.740 --> 01:31:56.780
that too where you can't step on any down arrows and it's really hard to do

01:31:56.780 --> 01:32:00.500
like some of that stuff is just super I could not do I tried doing that mission

01:32:00.500 --> 01:32:04.960
on a dance pad I could not get 150 notes to register with my feet so I think one

01:32:04.960 --> 01:32:09.340
song where you have to typically play bad to pass yeah there's there's a whole

01:32:09.340 --> 01:32:13.600
bunch of weird stuff there in dance master mode so I was like what do I have

01:32:13.600 --> 01:32:16.400
I'm going to literally get a D to set this up.

01:32:16.400 --> 01:32:17.560
Okay, I'll just step off.

01:32:17.560 --> 01:32:19.080
It's good attack.

01:32:19.080 --> 01:32:20.560
One other thing I want to ask you, Dark Knight,

01:32:20.560 --> 01:32:21.400
before we go to another call,

01:32:21.400 --> 01:32:23.760
what do you think about the Pump It Up thing,

01:32:23.760 --> 01:32:27.400
the custom soundtrack thing on Pump It Up?

01:32:27.400 --> 01:32:28.560
That's just like a major,

01:32:28.560 --> 01:32:31.680
maybe it might be a major coke of IE hot coffee,

01:32:31.680 --> 01:32:33.520
but A, to eat his own.

01:32:35.440 --> 01:32:37.400
So are you saying that kids everywhere now

01:32:37.400 --> 01:32:41.480
can make step files to porn soundtracks, or?

01:32:41.480 --> 01:32:48.480
The only thing I can think of though, Xbox Live you can't upload.

01:32:48.480 --> 01:32:50.480
Can you?

01:32:50.480 --> 01:32:52.480
I think.

01:32:52.480 --> 01:32:54.480
How? I don't know how to do it.

01:32:54.480 --> 01:33:00.480
You can upload if the game allows it, but Pump It Up doesn't allow it.

01:33:00.480 --> 01:33:04.480
Ultra Mix 2 does though.

01:33:04.480 --> 01:33:05.480
Does?

01:33:05.480 --> 01:33:07.480
Yeah, Ultra Mix 2 does.

01:33:07.480 --> 01:33:11.980
Maybe somebody in Mike can find a code for it.

01:33:11.980 --> 01:33:13.480
You never know. You never know what might happen.

01:33:13.480 --> 01:33:20.980
If Microsoft really does plan on setting up this big music store for their 360 that's going to compete with iTunes or whatever,

01:33:20.980 --> 01:33:24.980
which is a big rumor, they're going to set up their own music store to compete with iTunes via the 360,

01:33:24.980 --> 01:33:28.980
wouldn't that be interesting that not only could you download the song,

01:33:28.980 --> 01:33:33.980
but then you could also have, hey, you could have this fan step chart in DDR that you download with it.

01:33:33.980 --> 01:33:38.080
I don't know that would be kind of cheesy, but I could see it happening. I don't know might be a way to do it

01:33:38.660 --> 01:33:42.280
All right, anyway. We're gonna let you go see what we can get you another call

01:33:42.280 --> 01:33:46.820
But thank you so much for calling in tonight and have a good one all right night late up

01:33:47.460 --> 01:33:50.220
All right, let's go to another call one more guys before break

01:33:51.620 --> 01:33:56.140
Hello, you're on orange on the radio. Hey, what's up is Ron. Hello Ron channel. Hello

01:33:56.660 --> 01:34:02.200
Hey, oh, what's up? Hey, not not too much. Just you know been playing the hell out of extreme, too

01:34:02.200 --> 01:34:08.200
I've been playing the older mixes. As soon as I get a job, I'll pick up Extreme 2 and have fun with that.

01:34:08.200 --> 01:34:11.200
Okay, so you're still on the older mixes. That's alright.

01:34:11.200 --> 01:34:16.200
Yeah, I'm following what's going on. Everybody's bitching this song because I did it.

01:34:16.200 --> 01:34:21.200
Look, if you want this song that badly, buy the import or shut the fuck up.

01:34:21.200 --> 01:34:29.200
Yeah, I don't see... People are always going to find something to complain about. That's just inevitable.

01:34:29.200 --> 01:34:32.200
But this mix is pretty solid, honestly.

01:34:32.200 --> 01:34:36.200
Overall, you can't make people happy. You know, that's all it is.

01:34:36.200 --> 01:34:38.200
That's true.

01:34:38.200 --> 01:34:43.200
But let's take a little step from DDL. Let's do a little power power.

01:34:43.200 --> 01:34:47.200
In case you haven't heard, I went to the Yoko Ishida concert in New York City today.

01:34:47.200 --> 01:34:49.200
Ah! How was that?

01:34:49.200 --> 01:34:53.200
It was awesome. I'm posting pictures from the concert.

01:34:53.200 --> 01:34:55.200
It was a free concert at the Manhattan Mall.

01:34:55.200 --> 01:34:59.440
It took about 100 pictures, and if you go through the pictures, you'll see a lot of

01:34:59.440 --> 01:35:01.640
people up there power powering as well.

01:35:01.640 --> 01:35:03.240
Oh, that is so gay.

01:35:03.240 --> 01:35:04.240
No, that's cool.

01:35:04.240 --> 01:35:05.240
No, it's great.

01:35:05.240 --> 01:35:08.440
I didn't power power because I was too busy taking pictures and stuff.

01:35:08.440 --> 01:35:09.440
Uh-huh.

01:35:09.440 --> 01:35:14.200
I had fun, but one thing that always pisses me off is the fact that when they don't have

01:35:14.200 --> 01:35:19.160
any type of anime or video game gathering or whatever, you have to have one fanboy that

01:35:19.160 --> 01:35:20.160
pisses you off.

01:35:20.160 --> 01:35:23.960
You just want to strangle him, and your friends are like, no, don't.

01:35:23.960 --> 01:35:27.920
not worth it. I'm looking at some of these pictures very randomly on the site. Oh, don't

01:35:27.920 --> 01:35:33.960
they look cute? You were up near the front, weren't you? Yeah. If you look at this one

01:35:33.960 --> 01:35:41.360
picture I'm about to post, this is when I got my Power Power Mix CDs signed and stuff

01:35:41.360 --> 01:35:46.520
like that. All right on. Go you. And the one before that's my friend Aaron. We pushed him

01:35:46.520 --> 01:35:50.600
onto the stage so he could do Power Power as well. How many people were at this thing?

01:35:50.600 --> 01:35:58.600
Okay, there was about 40 people downstairs. Now, everybody around the first and second floors is about 100 or so.

01:35:58.600 --> 01:36:10.600
I mean, it was just so awesome. Words you really can't describe per se, but I did find somebody that videotaped it, so I'm trying to get a copy of the footage of the concert.

01:36:10.600 --> 01:36:14.600
Oh, yeah, I remember that guy. I met that guy when I was in Jersey.

01:36:14.600 --> 01:36:17.600
Yeah, Aaron. The fanboy.

01:36:17.600 --> 01:36:21.600
Alrighty. Awesome. He looks very happy to be with those three sexy ladies there.

01:36:21.600 --> 01:36:23.600
Awesome. Awesome.

01:36:23.600 --> 01:36:30.600
What we did was after we took the pictures, we went back and wished Yoko Ishida a happy birthday because her birthday is this Friday.

01:36:30.600 --> 01:36:31.600
Oh, right on.

01:36:31.600 --> 01:36:40.600
And I also found out that supposedly she's going to be on live with Regis and Kathy Lee. No, Regis and Kelly doing Power Power this Friday.

01:36:40.600 --> 01:36:41.600
No way.

01:36:41.600 --> 01:36:42.600
Way.

01:36:42.600 --> 01:36:43.600
That's gonna be awesome.

01:36:43.600 --> 01:36:45.600
That's what I've heard.

01:36:45.600 --> 01:36:49.800
Big props to Ron-chan, by the way, because that's the first time in about five years

01:36:49.800 --> 01:36:53.760
where I said, no way, and then I got the response, way.

01:36:53.760 --> 01:36:58.000
But it's the little things in life that amuse me.

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:01.720
That's great that they're going to do some Para-para on Regis and Kelly, because you

01:37:01.720 --> 01:37:02.720
know what?

01:37:02.720 --> 01:37:05.640
The audience for Regis and Kelly is like my grandma, okay?

01:37:05.640 --> 01:37:11.040
So they're so not going to get it, but I'm so going to TiVo that.

01:37:11.040 --> 01:37:12.040
Wow.

01:37:12.040 --> 01:37:14.400
Is there a TiVo that too?

01:37:14.400 --> 01:37:17.720
Just like that, there's a comment in the chatroom, somebody needs to TiVo that.

01:37:17.720 --> 01:37:19.600
I will TiVo it.

01:37:19.600 --> 01:37:23.080
Or Comcast ghetto knockoff TiVo, whatever they call it.

01:37:23.080 --> 01:37:24.080
I will...

01:37:24.080 --> 01:37:27.120
You do realize, somebody's going to TiVo it, and it's going to end up on a torrent site

01:37:27.120 --> 01:37:28.120
somewhere.

01:37:28.120 --> 01:37:29.120
Good, because we need to do...

01:37:29.120 --> 01:37:33.400
We haven't done movie time on Orange Lounge Radio in like months, so we need a good thing

01:37:33.400 --> 01:37:35.200
to skewer, so I'm excited.

01:37:35.200 --> 01:37:38.520
Oh, speaking of movies, one of my friends saw Serenity.

01:37:38.520 --> 01:37:39.520
This is what he said.

01:37:39.520 --> 01:37:40.520
Yeah?

01:37:40.520 --> 01:37:44.080
I liked Serenity when it was called Outlaw Star.

01:37:44.080 --> 01:37:49.280
I've heard people complaining that it's way too similar to certain animes out there.

01:37:49.280 --> 01:37:51.280
Here comes X to purr the weed and whore.

01:37:51.280 --> 01:37:52.280
Uh-oh.

01:37:52.280 --> 01:37:53.280
What?

01:37:53.280 --> 01:37:56.280
I just grabbed the mic.

01:37:56.280 --> 01:37:57.280
Serenity?

01:37:57.280 --> 01:38:00.980
I just grabbed Serenity so I automatically started for the mic.

01:38:00.980 --> 01:38:03.200
Is it a rip-off of popular animes?

01:38:03.200 --> 01:38:07.240
I have no clue because I don't watch anime.

01:38:07.240 --> 01:38:10.680
But if it is, it's really good and I recommend it.

01:38:10.680 --> 01:38:12.320
Watch your nearest theater.

01:38:12.320 --> 01:38:17.320
I saw the first episode of Buffy and I was like, this is a rip-devil-hunting orko.

01:38:17.320 --> 01:38:22.320
Well, I don't know. I guess it happens. What can you say?

01:38:22.320 --> 01:38:29.320
You know, maybe he was indirectly inspired. Maybe it's a fancy coincidence. I don't know.

01:38:29.320 --> 01:38:36.320
But there was the whole show that preceded it, so it's kind of tough to decide that your movie is going to rip it off after the fact.

01:38:36.320 --> 01:38:40.320
Well, from what I understand, the series ripped off Outlaw Star and Cowboy Bebop.

01:38:40.320 --> 01:38:47.240
Every good everybody steals from somebody. Yeah, that is true. Imitation is the finest form of flattery, right? Mm-hmm

01:38:48.280 --> 01:38:53.280
All right, we're gonna go ahead and let you go Ron Chan, so thank you so much for calling in. Okay. Peace

01:38:53.280 --> 01:39:00.320
Take care fellas. Peace y'all. Have a good one. Super. Bye Dark Sakura. She actually had to run out to take a call real quick

01:39:00.320 --> 01:39:02.320
She said bye.

01:39:02.480 --> 01:39:04.480
Later

01:39:04.720 --> 01:39:08.920
All right, we're gonna go to one more call here since I don't want to get into cage match with that Dark Sakura so

01:39:08.920 --> 01:39:12.920
So, our old buddy Zaku is hammering the line.

01:39:12.920 --> 01:39:14.920
Yeah, as always.

01:39:14.920 --> 01:39:16.920
As always. What's on your mind?

01:39:16.920 --> 01:39:17.920
Keep it!

01:39:17.920 --> 01:39:22.920
I know you've got an opinion. If anybody's got an opinion on Xtreme 2, I know you've got one, so what is it?

01:39:22.920 --> 01:39:29.920
Well, first of all, since I'm too broke to buy me a PS2, thus I don't have the game,

01:39:29.920 --> 01:39:36.920
but I have been hearing around that it's pretty good that people, especially within the city,

01:39:36.920 --> 01:39:41.280
There's a lot of city players I heard who are actually playing the game and actually

01:39:41.280 --> 01:39:45.440
going through the hell of Dance Master Mode.

01:39:45.440 --> 01:39:47.560
What do you think about Dance Master Mode?

01:39:47.560 --> 01:39:51.780
Is it appropriate for DDR on a home mix, or should they have just stuck to the, make it

01:39:51.780 --> 01:39:53.720
look like the arcade?

01:39:53.720 --> 01:39:58.120
In other words, it only applies to one type of player, like a hardcore person, like a

01:39:58.120 --> 01:40:04.360
seasoned DDR player, not like a newbie who basically hasn't heard a damn thing about

01:40:04.360 --> 01:40:05.360
it.

01:40:05.360 --> 01:40:11.500
They'll be shocked when they only see like what, 20, 25 songs in free mode when they

01:40:11.500 --> 01:40:16.020
have like shitloads more, they have to literally put effort into getting them.

01:40:16.020 --> 01:40:20.720
But I mean, is Dance Master Mode really that hard in the beginning anyway?

01:40:20.720 --> 01:40:21.720
It depends.

01:40:21.720 --> 01:40:26.900
I mean, from what I'm hearing, like certain challenges where you can't step on the original

01:40:26.900 --> 01:40:31.220
arrows or you can't step on a particular arrow, which is basically an in-the-group rip-off

01:40:31.220 --> 01:40:32.220
if you ask me.

01:40:32.220 --> 01:40:33.700
Those, well now, wait a minute.

01:40:33.700 --> 01:40:39.100
Like mines? Come on, you gotta admit, Konami's trying to play the mine cart in this one.

01:40:39.100 --> 01:40:47.100
But Poison Arrows existed in UltraMix before that and other mission modes, so just like

01:40:47.100 --> 01:40:51.140
when, you know, I could say that In the Groove ripped off the multiple arrow idea from either

01:40:51.140 --> 01:40:54.980
Pump It Up or DDR Solo, both of all had multiple arrows, so it's, you know.

01:40:54.980 --> 01:40:58.020
Yeah, but not more than two, how about more than two at the same time?

01:40:58.020 --> 01:41:06.020
Actually, DDR Dancing Stage, or DDR First Mix, one of the songs that was supposed to be on there, had three arrows at one time.

01:41:06.020 --> 01:41:07.020
But...

01:41:07.020 --> 01:41:13.020
So, okay, the step charts for Dropout Maniac on DDR Solo has four. You have to hit four at once.

01:41:13.020 --> 01:41:20.020
Hmm. All right. Anyways, MTV2 had their video mods thing on Friday.

01:41:20.020 --> 01:41:27.020
How did that go? I couldn't catch the beginning, though, so I can't vouch for what they had for DDR Extreme 2.

01:41:27.020 --> 01:41:33.020
So, you know, they're gonna air it again in about two and a half hours from now East Coast time.

01:41:33.020 --> 01:41:38.020
So, I'll probably see that beginning part when they had it.

01:41:38.020 --> 01:41:43.020
What the hell was the DDR reference on this thing?

01:41:43.020 --> 01:41:47.020
I don't know because I couldn't catch the beginning of the video.

01:41:47.020 --> 01:41:48.020
What good are you?

01:41:48.020 --> 01:41:49.020
I'm just kidding.

01:41:49.020 --> 01:41:54.220
I'm just kidding. As I said, you know, they're going to air it again in like 1.30 tonight,

01:41:54.220 --> 01:41:59.380
so obviously I'm going to be able to stay up to see it, so I can't vouch for it now.

01:41:59.380 --> 01:42:05.660
I'll set the TiVo. So we'll see. I wish I had a TiVo, but...

01:42:05.660 --> 01:42:11.300
Besides... Zaku, I want to know your thoughts on the Pump It Up thing, the custom soundtrack.

01:42:11.300 --> 01:42:17.820
Well, let me... obviously this is no surprise. Xbox is pretty much sold, you know, you could

01:42:17.820 --> 01:42:22.620
You pretty much sell an Xbox on the whole idea of basically playing games with your

01:42:22.620 --> 01:42:23.620
own tracks.

01:42:23.620 --> 01:42:25.420
Except none of them use it.

01:42:25.420 --> 01:42:26.420
Yes.

01:42:26.420 --> 01:42:30.660
Well, but I've seen a lot of, there's some folks I know that actually use it in certain

01:42:30.660 --> 01:42:31.660
games.

01:42:31.660 --> 01:42:35.900
But anyways, the whole thing, it's too basic in other words.

01:42:35.900 --> 01:42:40.580
Because it's not a robust step editor in my opinion.

01:42:40.580 --> 01:42:45.680
You need something obviously to find the BPM, but also something to calculate the gap.

01:42:45.680 --> 01:42:51.840
And something to assist you, to take every measure, so that way you can make your song

01:42:51.840 --> 01:42:53.440
sync up.

01:42:53.440 --> 01:42:57.240
And so it doesn't feel robust.

01:42:57.240 --> 01:43:02.880
Well you gotta check out the pump editor though, it's very similar to a DDR editor, but just

01:43:02.880 --> 01:43:05.680
with some extra stuff there to support the custom soundtrack.

01:43:05.680 --> 01:43:06.680
Alright.

01:43:06.680 --> 01:43:07.680
Yeah.

01:43:07.680 --> 01:43:11.600
Zaku, I'm hanging up on you now, we got a cage match to get to.

01:43:11.600 --> 01:43:13.120
Alright, later man.

01:43:13.120 --> 01:43:14.120
Take care.

01:43:14.120 --> 01:43:15.120
Bye.

01:43:15.120 --> 01:43:20.120
Alright, we're going to get into the Orange Lounge Cage Match here momentarily there.

01:43:20.120 --> 01:43:22.120
Interesting calls tonight, yeah?

01:43:22.120 --> 01:43:29.120
Alright, I was trying to think if there's any other things, little pieces of news I wanted to get to.

01:43:29.120 --> 01:43:37.120
I guess not, so why don't we get into the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match, which I'm so not set up for, by the way.

01:43:37.120 --> 01:43:40.120
Actually, I need somebody to stretch some time, because I'm so not set up for tonight's event.

01:43:40.120 --> 01:43:44.120
The question is, has anyone actually played the Karaoke Revolution Party demo yet?

01:43:44.120 --> 01:43:50.120
I haven't. No, I haven't because I can't find my microphone.

01:43:50.120 --> 01:43:52.120
Jamie doesn't sing in public.

01:43:52.120 --> 01:43:56.120
Well, you can play in the privacy of your own home, if you so choose.

01:43:56.120 --> 01:44:02.120
I don't sing outside of my car.

01:44:02.120 --> 01:44:05.120
I would play it if it had gorillas.

01:44:05.120 --> 01:44:08.120
Karaoke Revolution, Automobile Edition.

01:44:08.120 --> 01:44:10.120
Sing in your car?

01:44:10.120 --> 01:44:11.120
Karaoke Revolution for your cell phone, maybe?

01:44:11.120 --> 01:44:17.120
In fact, that's what they should have as one of the stages, you know, you're singing in your car or you're singing in your shower.

01:44:17.120 --> 01:44:24.120
Oh yeah, because like how you sing in different locations, like you know, you're at the country bar and then you're at the Super Bowl or whatever it's called.

01:44:24.120 --> 01:44:32.120
They should have the first stage that you're singing on the toilet or something.

01:44:32.120 --> 01:44:39.120
They need to have like the toys level where you're in the bathroom at the toys factory from toys singing in the corner.

01:44:39.120 --> 01:44:45.420
awesome I love that movie all right I'm ready for the cage matcher you guys yeah

01:44:45.420 --> 01:44:49.320
sure all right let's do it let's get into tonight's orange lounge radio cage

01:44:49.320 --> 01:44:55.200
match the way the cage match works boys and girls we're gonna put three songs in

01:44:55.200 --> 01:44:58.760
and they're gonna do battle head-to-head against each other and you guys will

01:44:58.760 --> 01:45:02.720
vote for your favorite and the winning song goes into rotation all week long on

01:45:02.720 --> 01:45:07.360
orange lounge radios for Monte music and video game music program which plays 24

01:45:07.360 --> 01:45:11.640
hours a day, seven days a week on this station when we're not here. It's your guys' vote

01:45:11.640 --> 01:45:17.860
that makes or breaks the cage match. The rules for how a song gets put in cage match is we

01:45:17.860 --> 01:45:20.760
have to want to put it in cage match. There's really no other rules. It doesn't have to

01:45:20.760 --> 01:45:25.920
be a Bamani song. It doesn't have to be a 2005 song. It just has to be something cool

01:45:25.920 --> 01:45:29.440
that we want to play on the air for you guys. So we're going to start off with last week's

01:45:29.440 --> 01:45:34.120
winner of which you're only going to hear a clip of because it was last week's winner.

01:45:34.120 --> 01:45:36.000
And it's going to be song number one you're going to hear tonight.

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:39.280
It's a remix of V from the Diverse Systems Collections.

01:45:39.280 --> 01:45:40.280
Which Diverse Systems was this?

01:45:40.280 --> 01:45:41.280
Eight?

01:45:41.280 --> 01:45:42.280
Nine.

01:45:42.280 --> 01:45:43.280
Nine.

01:45:43.280 --> 01:45:47.000
This is last week's winner, Dorisia with V. Enjoy.

01:45:47.000 --> 01:46:01.720
Gameplay

01:47:47.000 --> 01:48:14.720
Song number one in tonight's cage match, V, a little remix there.

01:48:14.720 --> 01:48:20.720
Alright, we're gonna get into the rest of the cage match tonight, and we're gonna go into song number two, which is Jamie's pick.

01:48:20.720 --> 01:48:24.720
Jamie, I had a hard time figuring out what your pick was. Would you care to explain it here?

01:48:24.720 --> 01:48:29.720
Um, I couldn't think of anything, cause I was busy doing my last bit of illustrator homework.

01:48:29.720 --> 01:48:37.720
So this is from, uh, Team America World Police, the montage song. Cause I couldn't think of anything else.

01:48:37.720 --> 01:48:43.720
Alright, so this is the montage song from Team America World Police, also featured in South Park.

01:48:43.720 --> 01:48:47.720
This is a very random pick, I must say, but let's check it out.

01:48:47.720 --> 01:48:49.720
I couldn't think of anything.

01:48:49.720 --> 01:48:52.720
Alright, here it is. We're going to go into song number two tonight.

01:48:52.720 --> 01:48:56.720
It is The Montage from Team America World Police.

01:48:56.720 --> 01:49:12.720
The hour's approaching to give it your best, and you've got to reach your prime.

01:49:12.720 --> 01:49:17.720
That's when you need to put yourself to the test, and show us the passage of time.

01:49:17.720 --> 01:49:20.720
We're gonna need a mom time.

01:49:20.720 --> 01:49:21.720
Mom time.

01:49:21.720 --> 01:49:23.720
Oh, I need a mom time.

01:49:23.720 --> 01:49:24.720
Mom time.

01:49:24.720 --> 01:49:30.720
To show a lot of things happening at once Remind everyone of what's going on

01:49:30.720 --> 01:49:36.720
And with every shot show a little improvement To show it won't take too long

01:49:36.720 --> 01:49:43.720
That's called a montage Girl, we want a montage

01:49:43.720 --> 01:49:49.720
And anything if you want to go From such a beginner to a pro

01:49:49.720 --> 01:49:52.720
Frozen with a monster

01:49:52.720 --> 01:49:55.720
Even Rocky had a monster

01:49:55.720 --> 01:49:56.720
Monster

01:50:07.720 --> 01:50:09.720
Monster

01:50:09.720 --> 01:50:27.720
Anything if you want to go from just a beginner to a pro

01:50:27.720 --> 01:50:33.720
You need a montage, ooh it takes a montage

01:50:33.720 --> 01:50:39.720
Always fade out in a montage

01:50:39.720 --> 01:50:46.720
If you fade out it seems like more time has passed in a montage

01:50:46.720 --> 01:51:00.720
I'm so bro and green

01:51:00.720 --> 01:51:09.720
Now song number two in tonight's cage match, Montage from Team America World Police. Definitely a random pick, but let's see, DarkSakura, what did you think of that on a scale of one to ten?

01:51:09.720 --> 01:51:11.720
Ten, fuck yeah!

01:51:11.720 --> 01:51:14.720
Extifer on a scale of one to ten.

01:51:14.720 --> 01:51:26.720
I would give it a 9, because it's pretty funny. I've never seen Team America, because I don't know.

01:51:26.720 --> 01:51:28.720
It's not as funny as South Park.

01:51:28.720 --> 01:51:37.720
Okay. Well, I never got into South Park until this year, so I mean, if it's that kind of humor, I may like it. But that song was great.

01:51:37.720 --> 01:51:40.720
Alright. Loki, your thoughts?

01:51:40.720 --> 01:51:45.720
I started off as a 5, but it became a 9 because it gradually got better over time.

01:51:46.720 --> 01:51:47.720
That's good.

01:51:47.720 --> 01:51:48.720
Like a montage.

01:51:48.720 --> 01:51:49.720
Like a montage, yeah, I get it.

01:51:50.720 --> 01:51:55.720
My thoughts is that, damn, between your song and my song, we're practically handing Loki another victory tonight.

01:51:57.720 --> 01:51:59.720
Are we going to need a montage for this?

01:51:59.720 --> 01:52:01.720
Wait until you fucking see what I picked, alright?

01:52:01.720 --> 01:52:02.720
But anyway, I thought-

01:52:02.720 --> 01:52:03.720
Do I need to go hide?

01:52:03.720 --> 01:52:05.720
I thought I was bad tonight, but this was pretty bad.

01:52:05.720 --> 01:52:06.720
Did you all get a montage?

01:52:06.720 --> 01:52:08.720
Yeah, funny enough, I picked a montage. No, I didn't.

01:52:08.720 --> 01:52:14.400
I did. That was... whatever. It's funny, but I just don't think people are going to vote

01:52:14.400 --> 01:52:18.840
for it. I really don't. But it gets a 7, because it is a pretty funny parody. But I think the

01:52:18.840 --> 01:52:23.640
funnier song in Team America World Police was the Everyone Has AIDS song. I almost picked,

01:52:23.640 --> 01:52:29.600
actually it was a tossup between the montage, Everyone Has AIDS, and Pearl Harbor Sucks

01:52:29.600 --> 01:52:35.940
and I Miss You. Even... There's a song called Everyone Has AIDS? Yeah, they're parodying

01:52:35.940 --> 01:52:41.420
rent in it. It's really politically incorrect and that's something that probably shouldn't

01:52:41.420 --> 01:52:45.420
be joked about. In the context of the movie it's really funny.

01:52:45.420 --> 01:52:51.460
Falls. Anyway, let's get into my pick. Song number

01:52:51.460 --> 01:52:56.060
three tonight is from a band that I consider a guilty pleasure band. And you know what

01:52:56.060 --> 01:53:02.420
that means. ABBA! No, it's not ABBA. This is definitely one of those guilty pleasure

01:53:02.420 --> 01:53:06.720
things and there really is no excuse for me liking this song at all and I

01:53:06.720 --> 01:53:12.020
apologize in advance but I'll be damned if this isn't just a damn fun song so my

01:53:12.020 --> 01:53:16.740
pick for tonight's cage mask is a brand new song by everyone's favorite lesbians

01:53:16.740 --> 01:53:23.740
on the Planet Tattoo. This is their new single, All About Us.

01:54:16.740 --> 01:54:42.740
If they hurt you, they hurt me too So we'll rise up, won't stop

01:55:12.740 --> 01:55:40.740
It's all about us It's all about, all about us

01:56:40.740 --> 01:56:47.740
Um, actually I can't, I couldn't hear because I can hear myself too loudly.

01:56:47.740 --> 01:56:52.740
Um, it was repetitive, and it sounded like everything else I've ever heard them do.

01:56:52.740 --> 01:56:54.740
So it gets a five.

01:56:54.740 --> 01:56:57.740
Extifer.

01:56:57.740 --> 01:57:01.740
It's, um, not, it's a very good song.

01:57:01.740 --> 01:57:05.740
It is very stupid. I don't like them. I don't like Tattoo.

01:57:05.740 --> 01:57:09.740
I want to get a tattoo, but I don't like Tattoo.

01:57:09.740 --> 01:57:13.740
And, uh, but the guy getting shot is pretty cool.

01:57:13.740 --> 01:57:17.740
But he should have raped her, I'm sorry. He should have raped her because...

01:57:17.740 --> 01:57:19.740
They all have one to ten before the angry emos come in.

01:57:19.740 --> 01:57:23.740
Oh, okay. Well, um, two. Loki.

01:57:23.740 --> 01:57:27.740
You know, it would have gotten a higher score with me, but I just didn't really know what the song was about.

01:57:27.740 --> 01:57:29.740
So, um, it's getting...

01:57:29.740 --> 01:57:31.740
It's all about them.

01:57:31.740 --> 01:57:34.740
I thought it would... Oh, okay. Well, um...

01:57:34.740 --> 01:57:36.740
It gets to seven.

01:57:36.740 --> 01:57:39.580
Wow, Loki actually gave a higher score than everybody else. I'm kind of surprised.

01:57:39.580 --> 01:57:43.220
Uh, I give that song a 10. Dude, Tattoo is awesome. It's awesome.

01:57:43.220 --> 01:57:47.580
They're so awesome. And the guy gets shot in the video and blood goes everywhere. It's badass.

01:57:47.580 --> 01:57:48.700
Alright.

01:57:48.700 --> 01:57:50.300
She should have been raped.

01:57:50.300 --> 01:57:51.140
Alright.

01:57:51.140 --> 01:57:53.060
That's just what Russians do.

01:57:53.060 --> 01:57:56.700
Alright, song number one. Let's recap the three songs you can vote for tonight.

01:57:56.700 --> 01:57:57.780
Song number one,

Dorisia with V

song number two you can vote for tonight, Montage

01:58:13.820 --> 01:58:18.540
Beginner to approach, you need a montage

01:58:18.540 --> 01:58:22.420
And song number three you can vote for tonight is Tattoo with All About Us

01:58:22.420 --> 01:58:33.660
If they hurt you, they hurt me too

01:58:33.660 --> 01:58:36.700
Alright, I had to choose the best lyric from the song there

01:58:36.700 --> 01:58:39.780
At least they weren't singing All About Us in it

01:58:39.780 --> 01:58:45.300
yeah anyway so there it is place vote now kids send a private message to Sky

01:58:58.780 --> 01:59:06.640
scene nothing not a damn thing huh nothing important sorry oh actually I

01:59:06.640 --> 01:59:15.640
I guess one small thing. Someone put up screenshots, or not screenshots, but conceptual artwork for what will be StepMania 4.

01:59:15.640 --> 01:59:16.640
Oh, it'll be StepMania 4?

01:59:16.640 --> 01:59:31.640
Yeah, someday. And it looks cool. It's, yeah, it looks cool. I don't really know how to describe it, it's just gonna be the same damn thing with another skin on it, but it'll be cool.

01:59:31.640 --> 01:59:38.640
So much for what's going on in The Simpsons.

01:59:38.640 --> 01:59:41.640
I did see that there was a new music game coming out on the PSP.

01:59:41.640 --> 01:59:45.640
As much of a music game as Rez was.

01:59:45.640 --> 01:59:48.640
Didn't we talk about that on a podcast like four weeks ago or something?

01:59:48.640 --> 01:59:50.640
I heard about it. I haven't seen much more about it.

01:59:50.640 --> 01:59:51.640
E3?

01:59:51.640 --> 01:59:53.640
No, not E3, but a Tokyo game show.

01:59:53.640 --> 01:59:54.640
No.

01:59:54.640 --> 01:59:55.640
The game's called E3.

01:59:55.640 --> 01:59:58.640
Oh, that's right. That's right. The game's called E3. I remember now.

01:59:58.640 --> 02:00:02.640
Have screenshots come out of this yet or something?

02:00:02.640 --> 02:00:08.640
No, I watched the Tokyo Game Special on G4, and that was one of their focuses, they were showing that game.

02:00:08.640 --> 02:00:17.640
Looks interesting, it's like a shooter game, but you can combo stuff to make music and stuff.

02:00:17.640 --> 02:00:22.640
It looks very similar to Rez.

02:00:22.640 --> 02:00:26.640
I thought G4 was Spike TV for kids now.

02:00:26.640 --> 02:00:41.640
They have their moments, but this, they actually had the two people from X-Play, Adam and Morgan, and then they had that Kevin guy from Attack on the Show.

02:00:41.640 --> 02:00:50.640
The smartest people on the network to cover Tokugame's show. Thank God they said whoever else that they have there that's really retarded.

02:00:50.640 --> 02:01:01.640
But they got the smart people and they covered it pretty well and they kind of went more in depth with like, you know, the Nintendo Revolution stuff and just everything. But it looked cool.

02:01:01.640 --> 02:01:07.640
Sounds cool. Alright, if I could just show Jamie something real quick. I wanted to make sure Jamie got a chance to see this.

02:01:07.640 --> 02:01:08.640
Is this a gun?

02:01:08.640 --> 02:01:12.640
Yes, this is something we were talking about just a second ago. If you don't mind, listeners.

02:01:12.640 --> 02:01:14.640
I need a gun to keep myself from harm.

02:01:14.640 --> 02:01:17.900
this as a radio show, but those of you that have seen this music video will know exactly

02:01:17.900 --> 02:01:31.460
what I'm talking about right here. And here we go, and bam! Cool! Blood! It looks kind

02:01:31.460 --> 02:01:42.420
of like jelly. It's making me hungry, I need to get something to eat. Does that change

02:01:42.420 --> 02:01:45.140
your score any? I'm just curious if that would alter your score.

02:01:45.140 --> 02:01:48.060
Four. Alright. Wait a minute, didn't you give it a higher

02:01:48.060 --> 02:01:51.140
score before that? Yeah, but now that I've had time to think

02:01:51.140 --> 02:01:56.140
about the song, it needs a montage. Bitch. Alright.

02:01:56.140 --> 02:01:57.140
So. Loki?

02:01:57.140 --> 02:01:58.140
I'll take this. Alright.

02:01:58.140 --> 02:02:05.860
But we have to save it, don't we? We have to save that.

02:02:05.860 --> 02:02:09.860
That's a... that's a... fine.

02:02:09.860 --> 02:02:15.860
Give him a hint. Give him a little hint. You can drop a little hint.

02:02:15.860 --> 02:02:19.860
We made a new web page.

02:02:19.860 --> 02:02:23.860
Okay. Okay. That's good. That's a good hint.

02:02:23.860 --> 02:02:24.860
It's new!

02:02:24.860 --> 02:02:27.860
It's new. Exactly.

02:02:27.860 --> 02:02:29.860
And it's a web page.

02:02:29.860 --> 02:02:34.900
Do kids know that Konami Style had their website launched this week for Guitar Freaks V?

02:02:34.900 --> 02:02:37.460
It also features the arcade controller.

02:02:37.460 --> 02:02:39.660
No, we didn't hit this last week's show, did we?

02:02:39.660 --> 02:02:40.660
Oh, we did.

02:02:40.660 --> 02:02:41.660
Son of a bitch.

02:02:41.660 --> 02:02:42.660
Never mind.

02:02:42.660 --> 02:02:45.260
I just realized we hit that on last week's show.

02:02:45.260 --> 02:02:46.260
Hit.

02:02:46.260 --> 02:02:47.260
Oh.

02:02:47.260 --> 02:02:48.260
How about...

02:02:48.260 --> 02:02:49.260
You know what I haven't done yet?

02:02:49.260 --> 02:02:50.260
What?

02:02:50.260 --> 02:02:51.260
What I need to do?

02:02:51.260 --> 02:02:56.780
I didn't have time during the week, but I need to pop in the DDR Extreme 2 DVD to find

02:02:56.780 --> 02:02:58.380
the track list.

02:02:58.380 --> 02:03:02.380
I think some folks already did that over in New York, right?

02:03:02.380 --> 02:03:06.380
I think they found it already.

02:03:06.380 --> 02:03:10.380
There's nothing really in there, from what I remember.

02:03:10.380 --> 02:03:14.380
What was the other thing I did want to point out? Did we talk about downgrader PSP

02:03:14.380 --> 02:03:18.380
firmware at all? No, not yet. I seemed like we talked about

02:03:18.380 --> 02:03:22.380
that on the podcast, didn't we? No, it didn't happen until... Oh, the actual

02:03:22.380 --> 02:03:26.380
downgrade. We talked about on the podcast the fact

02:03:26.380 --> 02:03:30.820
that 2.0 had been exploited, but we hadn't talked about the downgrader yet. So what does

02:03:30.820 --> 02:03:37.460
this mean for hackers on the PSP? It means if you bought one that happened to be firmware

02:03:37.460 --> 02:03:46.020
1.51 or 1.52 or 2.0, you can actually downgrade it back to 1.5. And the way you do that is

02:03:46.020 --> 02:03:54.320
you run this bit of homebrew code using an exploit in their image, their photo gallery

02:03:54.320 --> 02:03:59.960
everything. It basically is a buffer overflow which allows you to run your own code. And

02:03:59.960 --> 02:04:05.280
what that does is the program makes your PSP think it's a version 1.0. So then what you

02:04:05.280 --> 02:04:11.200
do is then you throw in the version 1.5 update that came out a while ago for the Japanese

02:04:11.200 --> 02:04:15.340
and you run the update. And what will happen is it will crash out at the very end because

02:04:15.340 --> 02:04:20.160
it realizes, hey, wait a second, this isn't, you know, version 1 PSP but then you just

02:04:20.160 --> 02:04:27.520
kind of reset it a few times and you're back at version 1.5. Problem is, is because it's

02:04:27.520 --> 02:04:34.640
only a 99% install, we don't know what kind of repercussions that will have later on.

02:04:34.640 --> 02:04:39.400
I've heard things from like people couldn't get their web browser working again to other

02:04:39.400 --> 02:04:44.560
stuff. But then again, I don't know if that's just, you know, people spreading rumors or

02:04:44.560 --> 02:04:49.260
what. But you can actually, people have downgraded, upgraded, downgraded, upgraded, so you can

02:04:49.260 --> 02:04:53.060
can do it, so you have the best of both worlds. I, on the other hand, I thought about selling

02:04:53.060 --> 02:04:58.300
my other PSP to downgrade it, or downgrade one and sell it, just to get some more money.

02:04:58.300 --> 02:05:02.980
I'm actually going to keep both because I don't know how, you know, obviously they're

02:05:02.980 --> 02:05:07.660
working on version 2.5, which is going to come out soon, so got to keep one for that

02:05:07.660 --> 02:05:14.140
stuff, and then one for the homebrew stuff. Keeping one at 1.5, so.

02:05:14.140 --> 02:05:17.540
Okay, we're going to go to a break now, and in this break we're going to do something

02:05:17.540 --> 02:05:20.800
different we've been playing DDR extreme 2 music all night however we

02:05:20.800 --> 02:05:24.600
haven't played any music from this game and a friend of mine was so kind to

02:05:24.600 --> 02:05:27.920
send me some rips from the game here we're gonna play some songs from DDR

02:05:27.920 --> 02:05:30.880
with Mario because I think a lot of you guys haven't heard what some of these

02:05:30.880 --> 02:05:33.800
songs sound like so we're gonna play some of the songs here we're gonna play

02:05:33.800 --> 02:05:39.040
here we go and I apologize I'm gonna horribly mispronounce this one it's a

02:05:39.040 --> 02:05:45.720
Mozart remix it's um Dokkan no Naka no Mozart and Hoppin Choppin we're gonna

02:05:45.720 --> 02:05:51.160
to play, and Mario no Carnival. They really need to put, like, the Para Para Dancers with

02:05:51.160 --> 02:05:55.000
that commercial that they had for Mario in the, like, U.S. commercials. I think that'd

02:05:55.000 --> 02:05:58.240
be great. We'll see. We'll see. All right, we're going to come back after this break

02:05:58.240 --> 02:06:02.040
of music from DDR with Mario so you guys can check this out, and we'll be back with more

02:06:02.040 --> 02:06:03.040
Orange Launch Radio.

02:06:03.040 --> 02:06:10.040
Come on!

02:06:10.040 --> 02:06:17.040
Come on!

02:06:17.040 --> 02:06:24.040
Come on!

02:06:24.040 --> 02:06:31.040
Come on!

02:06:31.040 --> 02:06:31.540
Hey!

02:06:31.540 --> 02:06:32.040
Hey!

02:06:32.040 --> 02:06:32.540
Hey!

02:06:36.540 --> 02:06:37.040
Come on!

02:06:37.040 --> 02:06:37.540
Go.

02:06:37.540 --> 02:06:39.540
Oh

02:07:07.540 --> 02:07:09.540
Oh

02:10:37.540 --> 02:10:39.540
Oh

02:10:39.540 --> 02:10:41.540
Oh

02:12:09.540 --> 02:12:37.140
Hi ho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio

02:12:37.140 --> 02:12:41.140
is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.

02:12:41.140 --> 02:12:46.140
Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

02:12:46.140 --> 02:12:47.140
Sup, kids?

02:12:47.140 --> 02:12:49.140
We're back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:12:49.140 --> 02:12:51.140
That was some music from DDR with Mario.

02:12:51.140 --> 02:12:52.140
Here we go.

02:12:52.140 --> 02:12:56.140
The Mozart one, Hoppin' Choppin', Carnival, et cetera.

02:12:56.140 --> 02:12:57.140
What did you think of DDR with Mario?

02:12:57.140 --> 02:12:59.140
That's the first time some of you guys are hearing that music.

02:12:59.140 --> 02:13:03.140
It's incredibly happy and makes me so happy I could puke.

02:13:03.140 --> 02:13:05.140
Yeah, that made me so happy that I think I pooped my pants

02:13:05.140 --> 02:13:06.140
because it lost control of my bowels.

02:13:06.140 --> 02:13:09.140
I don't need medication anymore.

02:13:09.140 --> 02:13:10.140
Thank you.

02:13:10.140 --> 02:13:12.140
Use effectser? No!

02:13:12.140 --> 02:13:15.140
Just listen to Mario DDR.

02:13:15.140 --> 02:13:18.140
I heard ice clamor sound effects in there.

02:13:18.140 --> 02:13:19.140
Yes you did.

02:13:19.140 --> 02:13:21.140
The typical Nintendo traits.

02:13:21.140 --> 02:13:22.140
And um...

02:13:22.140 --> 02:13:25.140
Yeah, I know why we don't play that anymore.

02:13:25.140 --> 02:13:27.140
No, it was cute. I thought some of it was cute.

02:13:27.140 --> 02:13:29.140
Like, Hoppin' Choppin' was a cute song, I thought.

02:13:29.140 --> 02:13:30.140
You know what that game needs?

02:13:30.140 --> 02:13:31.140
What?

02:13:31.140 --> 02:13:33.140
A lot of seizure inducing strobing.

02:13:33.140 --> 02:13:34.140
It should have.

02:13:34.140 --> 02:13:39.640
You know what's funny is that you'd think I would have heard that music at E3 when I actually had to play DDR with Mario, but I really didn't.

02:13:39.640 --> 02:13:44.840
But the funny thing is, to put in perspective how difficult DDR with Mario is, I triple-A'd the song I played.

02:13:44.840 --> 02:13:47.640
It's the first time I ever played it.

02:13:47.640 --> 02:13:52.840
And I'm not this... I don't profess to be some type of DDR king, okay? Like, I'm not that great.

02:13:52.840 --> 02:13:53.640
Yes, you do.

02:13:53.640 --> 02:13:55.140
I do not.

02:13:55.140 --> 02:14:02.840
My cousin, Dr. D, does, but I do not profess to be some type of DDR god.

02:14:02.840 --> 02:14:06.340
Anyway, uh, do you kids want to hear who won tonight's cage match? I bet you do.

02:14:06.340 --> 02:14:07.840
Why not?

02:14:07.840 --> 02:14:11.840
Let's hear the results in a montage.

02:14:11.840 --> 02:14:18.840
Actually, you could probably spell out the results in a V formation.

02:14:18.840 --> 02:14:20.840
That song gives me such a headache.

02:14:20.840 --> 02:14:22.340
That's tonight's winner.

02:14:22.340 --> 02:14:27.840
The other two songs not performing quite as badly as I anticipated, actually, so it was actually kind of close.

02:14:27.840 --> 02:14:29.840
So, I was kind of surprised.

02:14:29.840 --> 02:14:31.840
Extover, you got a mic? What?

02:14:31.840 --> 02:14:38.120
Oh, I was just thinking, um, is everybody in the chat room straight because V is like

02:14:38.120 --> 02:14:41.720
for vagina? Like, does everybody just like this one that much?

02:14:41.720 --> 02:14:48.020
You know, I think just like the real world, there's probably some straight people and

02:14:48.020 --> 02:14:52.440
some gay people and some, I don't know what the hell they are, people in our chat room.

02:14:52.440 --> 02:14:56.040
I don't really take the time to ask, you know, I don't go around to everybody.

02:14:56.040 --> 02:14:59.040
Let's take a poll. I don't want to take a poll.

02:14:59.040 --> 02:15:02.040
You don't want to take a poll, you're gay.

02:15:02.040 --> 02:15:03.040
I don't care.

02:15:03.040 --> 02:15:05.040
You like taking polls?

02:15:05.040 --> 02:15:10.040
Yeah, I don't want this to turn into ASL chat, okay?

02:15:10.040 --> 02:15:13.040
Or ASLS, you know, sexuality or whatever. I don't know.

02:15:13.040 --> 02:15:16.040
I don't care. I'm here to talk about games. I don't care who's gay.

02:15:16.040 --> 02:15:23.040
No, no, no. We will know how many of our listeners are gay next week when I put ABBA in.

02:15:23.040 --> 02:15:27.040
Yeah, also, any of you that voted for Tattoo are obviously gay. No, I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

02:15:27.040 --> 02:15:28.040
I'm so kidding.

02:15:28.040 --> 02:15:29.040
That's not true.

02:15:29.040 --> 02:15:30.040
It's not a true...

02:15:30.040 --> 02:15:32.360
I know it's not true, because I know who voted for Tattoo.

02:15:32.360 --> 02:15:33.360
I'm just teasing.

02:15:33.360 --> 02:15:38.880
Just, you know, let me know if you're a pole-loving motherfucker, just tell me.

02:15:38.880 --> 02:15:39.880
You made Roz cry.

02:15:39.880 --> 02:15:41.920
She just wanted me to say that.

02:15:41.920 --> 02:15:42.920
Why?

02:15:42.920 --> 02:15:43.920
Because you made her cry.

02:15:43.920 --> 02:15:44.920
Why did she cry?

02:15:44.920 --> 02:15:46.400
The chatroom made her cry.

02:15:46.400 --> 02:15:47.400
Who's Roz, and why did she cry?

02:15:47.400 --> 02:15:49.920
She's one of my friends from the Gorillaz board.

02:15:49.920 --> 02:15:51.080
Hello, friends.

02:15:51.080 --> 02:15:52.640
And the chatroom just made her cry.

02:15:52.640 --> 02:15:53.640
Why?

02:15:53.640 --> 02:15:54.640
For voting for that one?

02:15:54.640 --> 02:15:55.640
Yeah.

02:15:55.640 --> 02:15:56.640
Sorry.

02:15:56.640 --> 02:15:57.640
It happens.

02:15:57.640 --> 02:16:02.960
tell you. You know. The tribe has spoken. I think she should come in the chat room and

02:16:02.960 --> 02:16:07.960
bitch everybody out for me. Go for it. You, well, this is completely on a tangent but

02:16:07.960 --> 02:16:12.800
since, you know, we're not going anywhere right now. You said friends and that made

02:16:12.800 --> 02:16:17.000
me think of the friends game. I got to watch a video of the friends game and let me just

02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:22.360
say I wouldn't wish the friends game on my worst enemies. I watched a good eight minute

02:16:22.360 --> 02:16:26.680
video just saying that I wanted to fall asleep. I didn't even want to play the game after

02:16:26.680 --> 02:16:31.980
watching the game. It's just that awful. Is this another game that we need to get a copy

02:16:31.980 --> 02:16:38.560
of and autograph? It is bad. It is really bad. It's Friends, the one with all the trivia.

02:16:38.560 --> 02:16:48.300
It is narrated by the woman that does Janice on the show, the Fran Drescher wannabe. Hi!

02:16:48.300 --> 02:16:53.220
And it's completely bland and it just shows a bunch of clips from the show and the trivia

02:16:53.220 --> 02:16:57.780
is just lame and I just want the false statement I just like I'm like I can't

02:16:57.780 --> 02:17:06.600
watch this anymore yeah there's a there's a friends game I don't know if

02:17:06.600 --> 02:17:10.400

boobies in pee, um, mastectomy leftover boobies, um, hot hairy saggy man boobies, and then

02:18:32.500 --> 02:18:37.380
my last, uh, my favorite here, women in roller skates peeing in glass bowls.

02:18:37.380 --> 02:18:44.720
What the hell? Why did you do that? Um, I'm not gonna, I, you know, if you're gonna download

02:18:44.720 --> 02:18:48.960
that shit, I mean, don't blame it on me. Okay, this is from the person that left us with

02:18:48.960 --> 02:18:52.400
the bleached asshole joke

02:18:52.400 --> 02:18:53.840
by the way um...

02:18:53.840 --> 02:18:58.080
did they use something other than bleach? did I talk about the asshole strips yet?

02:18:58.080 --> 02:18:59.060
no

02:18:59.060 --> 02:19:02.160
oh well you know how you have like

02:19:02.160 --> 02:19:05.960
yes it's like crest white strips only put on your asshole you leave it for

02:19:05.960 --> 02:19:09.440
you leave them for like a few minutes and then you just strip them off and hey

02:19:09.440 --> 02:19:12.060
what about the kind that are supposed to dissolve

02:19:12.060 --> 02:19:13.800
when you go

02:19:13.800 --> 02:19:15.680
i'm disgusted

02:19:15.680 --> 02:19:21.680
I am so disgusted.

02:19:21.680 --> 02:19:26.240
Remember, mint scattles.

02:19:26.240 --> 02:19:29.880
Okay, we're gonna just get into this here.

02:19:29.880 --> 02:19:34.160
We're gonna get into a new segment here on the show. Well, it's a returning

02:19:34.160 --> 02:19:34.840
segment, really.

02:19:34.840 --> 02:19:38.720
We're trying to make this a regular segment. It's Extraverse Movie Review,

02:19:38.720 --> 02:19:43.440
boys and girls.

02:19:43.440 --> 02:19:45.240
Oh my god, that's gay.

02:19:45.240 --> 02:19:46.800
Exactly, just like you.

02:19:46.800 --> 02:19:48.560
So, Extraverb,

02:19:48.560 --> 02:19:51.060
what movie are you going to review today?

02:19:51.060 --> 02:19:55.200
The Long Kiss Goodnight. The Long Kiss Goodnight. Now, this is an old ass movie.

02:19:55.200 --> 02:19:56.320
Serenity.

02:19:56.320 --> 02:19:59.680
And Serenity, because, well, I've already talked about Serenity, but

02:19:59.680 --> 02:20:02.880
of course everybody probably knows that I'm a Serenity fan.

02:20:02.880 --> 02:20:06.280
I'm a Firefly fan. What did you think of Serenity on the

02:20:06.280 --> 02:20:10.240
second viewing this week? The second viewing was great. I got to see

02:20:10.240 --> 02:20:13.140
it with a lot of people and they all liked it. I was sitting in

02:20:13.140 --> 02:20:17.560
the straight guy row so I was an honorary straight guy. I counted all the girls' boobies

02:20:17.560 --> 02:20:23.140
and it seems like they all have two. I also... Wait, wait, wait. Does that mean that I was

02:20:23.140 --> 02:20:30.660
an honorary gay man that night? Yes. Um, Jamie was sitting in the gay man row, which you

02:20:30.660 --> 02:20:36.580
were sitting in. Yeah, thank you for reminding our listeners. No problem. And, um, I also,

02:20:36.580 --> 02:20:39.580
Um, oh that's so much fun.

02:20:39.580 --> 02:20:44.580
Um, anyways, I just, uh, I wanted to, uh, talk about Serenity more.

02:20:44.580 --> 02:20:49.580
Anyways, so Serenity is great, and then the third time I watched it, which was yesterday,

02:20:49.580 --> 02:20:52.580
I was enjoying it a lot too.

02:20:52.580 --> 02:20:57.580
And my sister, like, hit me in my arm when something really, uh, shocking happened in the movie,

02:20:57.580 --> 02:21:00.580
because she really likes Firefly as well.

02:21:00.580 --> 02:21:01.580
Right.

02:21:01.580 --> 02:21:02.580
So, but it hurt.

02:21:02.580 --> 02:21:04.580
So, Serenity on the third viewing. Thumbs up, thumbs down.

02:21:04.580 --> 02:21:06.580
Thumbs fucking up.

02:21:06.580 --> 02:21:08.580
Alright, thumbs fucking up.

02:21:08.580 --> 02:21:10.580
Alright, how about Long Kiss Goodnight?

02:21:10.580 --> 02:21:12.580
Now this movie's like 20 years old, how old is this?

02:21:12.580 --> 02:21:20.580
I loved that movie when I saw it the first time because Gina Davis kicks ass, and it's just a cheesy, like, action movie.

02:21:20.580 --> 02:21:28.580
But, I mean, I saw it for the first time in years with Garrett, who was on the show last week.

02:21:28.580 --> 02:21:30.580
Alright, the Poppin' Music Whore is what we call him on the ground.

02:21:30.580 --> 02:21:32.580
Oh, Poppin' Music Whore.

02:21:32.580 --> 02:21:38.580
Poppin Music Whore and I made fun of it quite a bit.

02:21:38.580 --> 02:21:40.580
I mean there are so many cheesy lines.

02:21:40.580 --> 02:21:46.580
There's like this line where this guy goes, where Gina Davis says something like,

02:21:46.580 --> 02:21:48.580
I'm saving myself to get raped.

02:21:48.580 --> 02:21:51.580
Like it's just so random. I'm like, okay.

02:21:51.580 --> 02:21:53.580
You know, that was, it was fun.

02:21:53.580 --> 02:21:55.580
It was, you know, it's a fun movie or whatever.

02:21:55.580 --> 02:21:57.580
It's a little long, but anyway.

02:21:57.580 --> 02:21:58.580
I give it.

02:21:58.580 --> 02:21:59.580
Thumbs up or thumbs down?

02:21:59.580 --> 02:22:00.580
Thumbs sideways.

02:22:00.580 --> 02:22:01.580
Alright.

02:22:01.580 --> 02:22:05.380
Now, lastly, you told me that you were going to be reviewing a TV show tonight because

02:22:05.380 --> 02:22:07.340
you didn't get to really see a new movie in the theater.

02:22:07.340 --> 02:22:08.780
You were going to review a TV show tonight.

02:22:08.780 --> 02:22:09.780
I did?

02:22:09.780 --> 02:22:10.780
Yeah.

02:22:10.780 --> 02:22:11.780
Which TV show?

02:22:11.780 --> 02:22:14.620
Oh, The Will and Grace.

02:22:14.620 --> 02:22:17.820
I'm glad you prepped for tonight's movie review segment.

02:22:17.820 --> 02:22:19.220
Will and Grace.

02:22:19.220 --> 02:22:24.880
I'd never gotten to Will and Grace until this year when I moved to Sacramento.

02:22:24.880 --> 02:22:31.260
I think it's pretty damn hilarious, but they had their live show which I was hoping for

02:22:31.260 --> 02:22:37.860
them to mess up more, but they didn't. But it was funny anyway. I had a good time with

02:22:37.860 --> 02:22:38.860
it.

02:22:38.860 --> 02:22:39.860
Alright, so thumbs up or thumbs down for Will & Grace?

02:22:39.860 --> 02:22:40.860
Thumbs up.

02:22:40.860 --> 02:22:41.860
Thumbs up.

02:22:41.860 --> 02:22:42.860
Up.

02:22:42.860 --> 02:22:43.860
Up.

02:22:43.860 --> 02:22:44.860
Up.

02:22:44.860 --> 02:22:45.860
Up.

02:22:45.860 --> 02:22:46.860
This is so boring.

02:22:46.860 --> 02:22:49.940
Alright. Thank you, Xtifer, for that movie review. Now get off our show.

02:22:49.940 --> 02:22:50.940
Thank you.

02:22:50.940 --> 02:22:55.460
Get off our show. Alright.

02:22:55.460 --> 02:22:59.780
We're going to get into another segment we love to do here on Orange Lawns Radio every

02:22:59.780 --> 02:23:11.620
single damn week because you know what, you know what, we are full of angst. I am full

02:23:11.620 --> 02:23:16.300
of tirade. That's right, so that's why we have to do the FUs of the week every single

02:23:16.300 --> 02:23:19.480
week. And DarkSakura, what's your excuse? Why do we have to do the FUs of the week every

02:23:19.480 --> 02:23:21.480
every single week.

02:23:21.480 --> 02:23:23.480
Balls.

02:23:30.480 --> 02:23:34.480
A big F.U. goes toward my sinus infection that I'm finally over.

02:23:34.480 --> 02:23:36.480
And the fact that I haven't worked out.

02:23:36.480 --> 02:23:41.480
An F.U. goes toward the Adobe company for making Illustrator?

02:23:41.480 --> 02:23:43.480
I hate vectors.

02:23:43.480 --> 02:23:47.480
You know you've been doing Illustrator homework for too long?

02:23:47.480 --> 02:23:54.480
When you start seeing real life in terms of vectors, I hate vectors. I hate them, hate them, hate them.

02:23:54.480 --> 02:24:02.480
And I am posting my homework in my chatroom. I did that one best, which is in a red monotone. It really is looking like shit.

02:24:02.480 --> 02:24:15.480
I also am mad at people in SUVs. What's that kind of like on the Escalade? It looks like it's a fake SUV with a truck ass?

02:24:15.480 --> 02:24:17.480
I don't like the SUVs that look like a box.

02:24:17.480 --> 02:24:20.480
Someone at Sam's Club last night was double parked in one of them.

02:24:20.480 --> 02:24:23.480
And I totally made fun of them loudly in the parking lot and they hurt me.

02:24:23.480 --> 02:24:24.480
Was it a lesbian?

02:24:24.480 --> 02:24:27.480
No, it was some stupid, yuppie-looking man.

02:24:27.480 --> 02:24:29.480
Oh. So it was a lesbian.

02:24:29.480 --> 02:24:30.480
I was screaming,

02:24:30.480 --> 02:24:33.480
Hi! I have money! And I have shit for brains that can't park!

02:24:33.480 --> 02:24:35.480
And he heard me and then I drove off.

02:24:35.480 --> 02:24:36.480
That's awesome.

02:24:36.480 --> 02:24:39.480
You know, I called a lady a cunt one time because Rob told me to.

02:24:39.480 --> 02:24:41.480
Really?

02:24:41.480 --> 02:24:46.440
He told me to roll down the window and cuz he was some lady cut him off in the parking lot

02:24:46.440 --> 02:24:50.000
And he goes that lady's a cunt Christopher roll down that window a car cunt

02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:54.080
It's just jokingly you know and I'm like I looked at him, and I looked at everybody else in the car

02:24:54.080 --> 02:24:57.960
I said well, okay, nine round. I rolled down the window, and I said you're a cunt

02:24:59.760 --> 02:25:06.920
And and Rob can back me up. That's he's not making this shit up. He really isn't um and

02:25:06.920 --> 02:25:12.920
And, uh, Legend of Zaku, you get an F.U. because I've had my work on for a very long fucking time.

02:25:12.920 --> 02:25:18.920
And I still hate the stupid goddamn program because he made us fucking use the pen tool.

02:25:18.920 --> 02:25:25.920
I could have done the whole thing with the drawing tool, but no, we had to do it with the pen tool.

02:25:25.920 --> 02:25:29.920
So, don't fucking ever correct me again. You don't have the right.

02:25:29.920 --> 02:25:37.920
Um, a second Fe goes toward Loki's song because it gives me a headache every time I hear it.

02:25:37.920 --> 02:25:45.920
Um, and an Fe did gold detailing on cars that really don't need gold detailing.

02:25:45.920 --> 02:25:54.920
Um, and, um, also another Fe legend is Aku because I was not a math major because it was a waste of my time.

02:25:54.920 --> 02:26:05.160
Um, and, uh, really, um, okay, if he says anything more about what I need, I'm fucking

02:26:05.160 --> 02:26:06.160
kicking you, okay?

02:26:06.160 --> 02:26:09.560
In fact, I'm gonna do it anyway just because I fucking feel like it.

02:26:09.560 --> 02:26:12.240
You piss me off every time I come here.

02:26:12.240 --> 02:26:15.240
Stop pissing me off!

02:26:15.240 --> 02:26:21.400
Um, and, uh, F.U. goes toward, uh, everything else.

02:26:21.400 --> 02:26:28.400
That was fantastic. That was. Is that it? Yeah. Alright, here we go. Next up, Loki. Okay,

02:26:35.680 --> 02:26:40.320
I've really got like one major one that I need to get off my chest and that is, fuck

02:26:40.320 --> 02:26:46.160
you to the fact that I'm potentially have to go to jury duty on Tuesday. Tell them you're

02:26:46.160 --> 02:26:49.160
Go to school. You'll get out of it until December.

02:27:16.160 --> 02:27:25.240
so, whatever. And, um, yeah, pretty much that, and for some reason, um, I'm having problems

02:27:25.240 --> 02:27:34.200
with certain things, uh, web page related, that piss me off. But, um, yeah, I'm done.

02:27:34.200 --> 02:27:36.200
That's all I really have.

02:27:40.200 --> 02:27:42.200
Okay, my turn then.

02:27:49.200 --> 02:27:56.200
I want to give an F.U. to me for not getting enough sleep at night throughout the weekend, on the weekend.

02:27:57.200 --> 02:28:00.200
I want to give an F.U. to the fact... Shut the fuck up Christopher.

02:28:00.200 --> 02:28:05.320
I want to give an F.U. to the fact that I haven't been eating very well all week, but

02:28:05.320 --> 02:28:08.760
at least I've kind of, despite my irregular eating patterns, I've actually managed to

02:28:08.760 --> 02:28:12.040
lose some weight, so I guess I can't complain too much except, you know, I don't want to

02:28:12.040 --> 02:28:15.940
like kill my liver or anything.

02:28:15.940 --> 02:28:21.760
And so an F.U. to lack of motivation for that, an F.U. to other drama that I'm going through

02:28:21.760 --> 02:28:28.400
professionally right now, but I'll be okay, and just an F.U. to the fact that I still

02:28:28.400 --> 02:28:32.400
I still have work left to do and it's Sunday night and I've got to have it done by tomorrow morning.

02:28:32.400 --> 02:28:33.400
Sucks.

02:28:33.400 --> 02:28:36.400
And then, um, I guess that's it.

02:28:36.400 --> 02:28:40.400
F you to Fandango because it costs like $1.25 to use Fandango.

02:28:40.400 --> 02:28:43.400
Did you do the Fandango with your credit card?

02:28:43.400 --> 02:28:44.400
I did.

02:28:44.400 --> 02:28:45.400
Fandango.

02:28:45.400 --> 02:28:46.400
Fandango.

02:28:46.400 --> 02:28:47.400
HoboCam.

02:28:47.400 --> 02:28:48.400
HoboCam.

02:28:48.400 --> 02:28:51.400
Um, and come to find out that Serenity wasn't even that crowded.

02:28:51.400 --> 02:28:53.400
Like, I could have just walked right in and got tickets.

02:28:53.400 --> 02:28:57.400
I thought, just because of all the hype on LJ, I thought that theater was going to be packed.

02:28:57.400 --> 02:29:06.400
Actually, I'm sure that the earlier ones were, but I still think it's funny that I, uh, woke up late and then made it down the freeway in 15 minutes.

02:29:06.400 --> 02:29:09.400
Alright, that was crazy. Alright.

02:29:09.400 --> 02:29:10.400
Things I do for fandom.

02:29:10.400 --> 02:29:14.400
Alright, let's get to extrovertz FUs.

02:29:14.400 --> 02:29:19.400
Um, FU to people with unnecessary drama.

02:29:19.400 --> 02:29:24.400
You know, um, I'm so indifferent to you, I don't care.

02:29:24.400 --> 02:29:26.400
Don't bring it in, put it in my face.

02:29:26.400 --> 02:29:34.400

F you to Bevmo, or Beverages and More, but as I call it, the Bevmo, for having such great

drinks that suck my wallet dry.

Another F you to Bevmo for having paper bags that have no handles.

02:31:14.980 --> 02:31:18.940

02:31:40.940 --> 02:31:41.660
I agree

02:31:41.660 --> 02:31:45.340

Fuck Break like I'll get out because it's the worst modifier ever.

02:31:57.740 --> 02:32:02.740
This fuck ass mission has literally made Dance Master impossible to complete for me.

02:32:02.740 --> 02:32:05.540
And everybody, I want you to use fuck ass in a sentence later today.

02:32:05.540 --> 02:32:07.340
That's the word of the day.

02:32:07.340 --> 02:32:11.740
And fuck anybody who said the dynamite rave heavy on reverse on hard because it wasn't

when you had to not do well on it

02:32:16.860 --> 02:32:20.860
and of course one for Sky because of his hidden bad omen from last week

02:32:20.860 --> 02:32:24.740
uh... you guys may or may not remember I put a hex on Rini last week because um...

02:32:24.740 --> 02:32:29.700
I was mad at him about something I don't remember what now

02:32:29.700 --> 02:32:34.420
Brightsta says F you to gas prices F you to people who smoke I'd like to sue you for

F you to the campus store for having such high prices for food, F you to my router which

02:32:43.720 --> 02:32:48.200
XP keeps showing as disconnecting my ethernet cable physically.

02:32:48.200 --> 02:32:54.040
And just an FYI, as someone who used to smoke, your anger is not going to make them stop

02:32:54.040 --> 02:32:55.040
any faster.

02:32:55.040 --> 02:32:59.120
By the way, as far as the people in dorm rooms that play their music really loudly, what

02:32:59.120 --> 02:33:04.080
I used to do is I used to, when the people across the hall would play their rap really

02:33:04.080 --> 02:33:08.960
loudly, because I hate, you know, that type of rap, I would turn on my stereo really loud,

02:33:08.960 --> 02:33:15.080
was on top of my chest of drawers, and we had cinder block walls, and would crank Vanessa

02:33:15.080 --> 02:33:20.000
May to the ultimate loudness on Takata and Fugin D minor, but you should do that with

02:33:20.000 --> 02:33:26.340
the organ version, because I guarantee you, it will chase people off, and you'll have

02:33:26.340 --> 02:33:29.480
the entire building to yourself. It works!

02:33:29.480 --> 02:33:38.040
To the person quitting smoking, maybe you should think about having to fuck ass every

02:33:38.040 --> 02:33:42.840
time you want to smoke a sir 800 says a big f you to my trick teacher who is a

cop in front of me and I didn't want to be arrested

02:33:54.920 --> 02:34:00.860

Yeah, tell one of your callers to go jump in traffic.

02:34:38.560 --> 02:34:39.560
Enjoy your life.

02:34:39.560 --> 02:34:40.840
We're not going to pay your claim.

02:34:40.840 --> 02:34:42.220
Go jump in traffic.

We're going to play Spin Spin Sugar, Tomorrow, which is a great Konami original.

02:36:01.440 --> 02:36:02.720
I really like this song, Tomorrow.

02:36:02.720 --> 02:36:03.600
Not like Annie.

02:36:03.600 --> 02:36:05.280
Tomorrow, tomorrow.

02:36:05.280 --> 02:36:06.800
That's exactly what I thought of.

02:36:06.800 --> 02:36:08.240

02:36:08.880 --> 02:36:11.600
And then the last song we're going to play is Fat Boy Slim with Wonderful Night.

We didn't even get to all of them.

02:36:23.520 --> 02:36:25.520
So we missed your question last week.

02:36:25.520 --> 02:36:28.280

02:38:47.840 --> 02:38:49.840
I've got so much to lose

02:39:17.840 --> 02:39:21.840
Drop it, anymore

02:40:16.840 --> 02:40:20.720
Music search, and you need a tune-up Soon as they out the gate, they all wanna

02:40:20.720 --> 02:40:24.080
hit a corner, uh-huh Well, that was cool, but now, but then I heard

02:40:24.080 --> 02:40:27.200
a rumor, uh-huh Your crew was riding for the White Cliffs of

02:40:27.200 --> 02:40:30.560
Dover, uh-huh Well, let me tell you how we do it in California

02:40:30.560 --> 02:40:35.720
We'll have you on the run just like a Puma If it don't move us, ain't paid your dues

02:40:35.720 --> 02:40:39.640

02:40:46.480 --> 02:40:49.280
It's a wonderful night, you gotta shake it for me

02:40:49.280 --> 02:40:52.280
It's a wonderful night, come on and break it on down

02:40:52.280 --> 02:40:55.080
Girl I want it, you got it, your body's like an autotic

02:40:55.080 --> 02:40:58.280
The thought is autoerotic, come on and break it on down

02:40:58.280 --> 02:41:00.580
Can I get it on credit or get your brick house?

02:41:00.580 --> 02:41:04.480
I bet it, take it as far as you let it, come on and break it on down

02:41:10.280 --> 02:41:13.080
That the spot'll get hot, that it's ready to pop

02:41:13.080 --> 02:41:16.080
Don't even look at the clock, all of your problems forgotten

02:41:16.080 --> 02:41:17.760
It's time to rock till you drop

02:41:17.760 --> 02:41:22.240
Will the force end just like with the epicenter of a party's base tremors? Come on!

02:41:22.240 --> 02:41:25.280
It's a wonderful night, gotta take it from me

02:41:25.280 --> 02:41:28.400
It's a wonderful night, come on and break it on down

02:41:28.400 --> 02:41:31.280
It's a wonderful night, gotta take it from me

02:41:31.280 --> 02:41:34.320
It's a wonderful night, come on and break it on down

02:41:36.320 --> 02:41:39.920
After this song, we'll be having a Let Them Move marathon

02:41:39.920 --> 02:41:40.400
Nooooooo

02:41:40.400 --> 02:41:46.400
Just kidding, Orange Lounge Radio, crap-free Bhimani Radio.

02:41:46.400 --> 02:41:49.400
Welcome back kids, we're about ready to get into Ask Orange Lounge.

02:41:49.400 --> 02:41:54.400
However, first off I wanted to point out that we actually have somebody who,

02:41:54.400 --> 02:42:00.400
there was an F.U. back there that was about Bhimani style and how they're down all the time.

02:42:00.400 --> 02:42:04.400
Actually we have somebody who happens to be one of their moderators over at Bhimani style

02:42:04.400 --> 02:42:08.400
that would like us to clarify, they aren't down for redesigning.

02:42:08.400 --> 02:42:11.760
motherboard on their server went kaboom!

02:42:11.760 --> 02:42:15.440
There's been word, however, that MontyStyle 7.0 is progressing nicely, however.

02:42:15.440 --> 02:42:17.440
Just a friendly clarification.

02:42:17.440 --> 02:42:21.520
I need to also make the announcement, the one that I mentioned to you during the break.

02:42:21.520 --> 02:42:22.520
Sure.

02:42:22.520 --> 02:42:30.240
There will not be a pump up in volume this week because of other reasons, but I will

02:42:30.240 --> 02:42:34.720
be returning the week after with the much promised, because actually people did ask

02:42:34.720 --> 02:42:36.720
for it, Blur Marathon.

02:42:36.720 --> 02:42:37.720
Awesome.

02:42:37.720 --> 02:42:40.200
All right, sounds good.

02:42:40.200 --> 02:42:42.520
And I'm bringing back my weeknight show

02:42:42.520 --> 02:42:43.360
sometime this month.

02:42:43.360 --> 02:42:44.800
Absolutely, positively.

02:42:44.800 --> 02:42:46.000
No more delaying for me.

02:42:46.000 --> 02:42:48.520
So I'll be back sometime this month with something special

02:42:48.520 --> 02:42:51.040
for you kids.

02:42:51.040 --> 02:42:51.640
So we'll see.

02:42:51.640 --> 02:42:52.720
All right, anyway, moving on.

02:42:52.720 --> 02:42:54.200
Let's go to Ask Orange Lounge.

02:42:54.200 --> 02:43:05.440
Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question, what will we find out this week on Orange

02:43:05.440 --> 02:43:07.400
Lounge Radio?

02:43:07.400 --> 02:43:15.640
My question is this, who will be the first person to use the word fuckass in their question?

02:43:15.640 --> 02:43:21.640
What would your ultimate video game be?

02:43:21.640 --> 02:43:27.640
Golf Land Birthday Party Sniper

02:43:27.640 --> 02:43:30.640
would be my ultimate video game.

02:43:30.640 --> 02:43:33.640
Dark Sakura, do you have an ultimate video game?

02:43:33.640 --> 02:43:35.640
The Guardian Legend

02:43:35.640 --> 02:43:37.640
Okay, I'm not sure if the part would be...

02:43:37.640 --> 02:43:41.640
Completely redone for one of the new systems.

02:43:41.640 --> 02:43:42.640
That would be very sexy.

02:43:42.640 --> 02:43:47.640
What would your ultimate video game be?

02:43:47.640 --> 02:43:52.640
In the ass.

02:43:52.640 --> 02:43:57.640
Loki, what would your ultimate video game be?

02:43:57.640 --> 02:44:02.640
I think they should have a fighting game with every character from all the systems.

02:44:02.640 --> 02:44:07.640
Just one giant brawl. Call it Console Wars or something like that.

02:44:07.640 --> 02:44:14.640
Alusion says, What's it all about, Alfie?

02:44:14.640 --> 02:44:21.640
Well, I don't watch crappy Jude Law movies, so I don't know.

02:44:21.640 --> 02:44:25.640
And I didn't watch the crappy original either, I'm sorry to say, so I don't really know what it's all about.

02:44:25.640 --> 02:44:28.640
Apparently they weren't crappy. I mean, they got some critical mass, didn't they?

02:44:28.640 --> 02:44:30.640
Well, the first one I'm sure was critically loved.

02:44:30.640 --> 02:44:34.640
You say Alfie, I start thinking of like in Barbarella, her shit. Alfie?

02:44:34.640 --> 02:44:38.280
Well I think of the little creature from Melmac that liked to eat cats.

02:44:38.280 --> 02:44:39.280
That's Alf!

02:44:39.280 --> 02:44:42.400
Well you could call him Alfie as a nickname.

02:44:42.400 --> 02:44:43.400
No.

02:44:43.400 --> 02:44:44.400
Ha!

02:44:44.400 --> 02:44:45.880
I kill me!

02:44:45.880 --> 02:44:47.880
Damn you people.

02:44:47.880 --> 02:44:50.440
Ha ha ha ha.

02:44:50.440 --> 02:44:54.480
Brightsta says, can you pass me the first of the Mario Mix songs we heard?

02:44:54.480 --> 02:44:57.120
I'd like to add Captain Lou Albano to it.

02:44:57.120 --> 02:45:00.240
Now kids, piracy is wrong.

02:45:00.240 --> 02:45:02.160
Email me off air.

02:45:02.160 --> 02:45:07.920
However, it did sound an awful lot like, you know, the, or actually, let me get into this.

02:45:07.920 --> 02:45:16.920
Do the Mario, swing your arms from side to side, come on, the time to go, do the Mario!

02:45:16.920 --> 02:45:23.520
Total silence.

02:45:23.520 --> 02:45:30.080
Sockarina says, um, will my request for that diverse system remix of Quasar be played before

02:45:30.080 --> 02:45:34.820
the end of the show. Not likely tonight, my friend, but probably next week when we don't

02:45:34.820 --> 02:45:38.240
have so much Xtreme 2 music to worry about.

02:45:38.240 --> 02:45:43.740
Sakarina says, what does each member of the Orange Launch Radio crew prefer? Hairy or

02:45:43.740 --> 02:45:52.700
hairless balls?

02:45:52.700 --> 02:45:56.620
It's a toss-up. Because, you know, there's some days where I'm like, you know, wake up

02:45:56.620 --> 02:46:01.820
in the morning you know and you know want to get my daily you know porn for

02:46:01.820 --> 02:46:07.540
breakfast and it's like maybe I want to see hairy balls sometimes you know wake

02:46:07.540 --> 02:46:13.480
up in the morning and I want to see hairless balls sometimes I have that you

02:46:13.480 --> 02:46:19.020
know a can desire to shave my own balls Loki okay here you go how about balls

02:46:19.020 --> 02:46:22.820
that aren't as hot as the surface of the Sun and fucking sweaty all the time

02:46:22.820 --> 02:46:31.020
time. Those are the balls that we prefer. How about bowling balls? I like cheese balls.

02:46:31.020 --> 02:46:41.980
Cheese balls are good. Jazz says, the answer to your question is I can't say that on air.

02:46:41.980 --> 02:46:50.940
That's what it is. I like meatballs. Yeah, meatballs. For my Q and A. And Jazz, don't

02:46:50.940 --> 02:47:00.940
Zaku says, what will I win if I guess the DDR song used in last Friday's episode of MTV2's Video Mods featuring DDR Extreme 2?

02:47:00.940 --> 02:47:02.940
I don't know.

02:47:02.940 --> 02:47:04.940
Does anybody in this room watch MTV?

02:47:04.940 --> 02:47:06.940
I know, I don't watch it. Are they giving it away?

02:47:06.940 --> 02:47:08.940
Reject false icons!

02:47:08.940 --> 02:47:10.940
Are they giving it away? Because we're not.

02:47:10.940 --> 02:47:16.940
After they did that next marathon for like five days straight, I was like, I can't watch this channel anymore.

02:47:16.940 --> 02:47:23.440
Jaded wants to know, where did you get the Ask Orange Lounge intro music?

02:47:23.440 --> 02:47:28.980
The Ask Orange Lounge intro music is actually Journey to the Wonderland from Keyboard Mania

02:47:28.980 --> 02:47:29.980
2.

02:47:29.980 --> 02:47:34.900
It's Keyboard Mania 2, it's Journey to the Wonderland by NPB.

02:47:34.900 --> 02:47:45.560
And then the lyrics, of course, are sung by yours truly, the one and only Sky.

02:47:45.560 --> 02:47:51.960
says hey Sky you should play get busy just to throw the chatroom off you know

02:47:51.960 --> 02:47:54.760
there's a reason I didn't play get busy tonight and that's because I had to play

02:47:54.760 --> 02:48:00.640
it 20 times this week in mission mode Renee wants to know could you help a

02:48:00.640 --> 02:48:05.400
poor soul with my break problem pretty please I already used step mania and I

02:48:05.400 --> 02:48:13.000
can't do that fuck-ass thinking hehe um you know break I remember was in one of

02:48:13.000 --> 02:48:24.000
The best way to do it was to play that song over and over in regular mode and so you kind

02:48:24.000 --> 02:48:28.260
of like, you start to hear your feet as a separate rhythm in your head.

02:48:28.260 --> 02:48:30.920
It's very similar to the way you get really good at 2DX, you start to hear what the key

02:48:30.920 --> 02:48:33.800
patterns sound like in your head, that's what you're going to have to do with this DDR thing

02:48:33.800 --> 02:48:37.480
is play the song over and over in regular mode and hear the pattern of the steps in

02:48:37.480 --> 02:48:41.520
your head and then of course then again if it's a song he hasn't unlocked yet, I guess

02:48:41.520 --> 02:48:42.520
you're just fucked.

02:48:42.520 --> 02:48:44.520
Sorry, I don't know what to tell you.

02:48:44.520 --> 02:48:47.520
Break, by the way, is when the arrows slow down as they reach the top.

02:48:47.520 --> 02:48:50.520
It's the reverse of Boost.

02:48:50.520 --> 02:48:58.520
Bugged wants to know, what fuck-ass games have you had the joy of playing as of late?

02:48:58.520 --> 02:48:59.520
None.

02:48:59.520 --> 02:49:01.520
I played Pack and Roll earlier today. It was kind of cool.

02:49:01.520 --> 02:49:03.520
I'll talk about that more on the podcast.

02:49:03.520 --> 02:49:06.520
I kind of remember the last video game I played.

02:49:06.520 --> 02:49:08.520
Didn't I make you play something?

02:49:08.520 --> 02:49:10.520
Sweaty Balls of the Game.

02:49:10.520 --> 02:49:17.520
as in the white mage is the bitch, the game

02:49:40.520 --> 02:49:47.520
The other day I was telling Helen Keller jokes to Loki and his fiance and they just loved it.

02:49:47.520 --> 02:49:50.520
It wasn't even funnier because I was partially drunk.

02:49:50.520 --> 02:49:53.520
It's the funniest I've seen you in a while.

02:49:53.520 --> 02:49:56.520
Dark Sakura, I know, because I can't be funny unless I'm ripping off other people's jokes.

02:49:56.520 --> 02:49:57.520
That's true.

02:49:57.520 --> 02:49:59.520
Dark Sakura, we need a Your Mama joke of the week.

02:49:59.520 --> 02:50:01.520
Give me a second.

02:50:01.520 --> 02:50:02.520
Okay, you need to work on that.

02:50:02.520 --> 02:50:10.140
Dark Tetsuya wants to know, will Sky's voice, the video game, ever return or is it doomed

02:50:10.140 --> 02:50:11.480
to obscurity?

02:50:11.480 --> 02:50:13.060
My friend, it is doomed to obscurity.

02:50:13.060 --> 02:50:14.060
What?

02:50:14.060 --> 02:50:16.500
It's an inside joke from like two and a half years ago on this.

02:50:16.500 --> 02:50:21.220
I used to get on the, we used to do, before we were a real structured station, not that

02:50:21.220 --> 02:50:26.220
we ever have been a structured station, but Dark Soccer and I used to do what was called

02:50:26.220 --> 02:50:28.860
fuck off shows where we would just randomly get on the stream.

02:50:28.860 --> 02:50:30.100
We didn't have scheduled programs.

02:50:30.100 --> 02:50:34.480
We would just randomly, like it could be midnight on a Tuesday night, we would just randomly

02:50:34.480 --> 02:50:37.980
get on the stream and kick everyone off and go live and do our own show, just play music

02:50:37.980 --> 02:50:40.080
we wanted to play and do whatever the fuck we wanted.

02:50:40.080 --> 02:50:43.280
So we called it the Fuck Off Show, because if you didn't like what we were doing, you

02:50:43.280 --> 02:50:45.180
could fuck off.

02:50:45.180 --> 02:50:48.960
And I used to get on there and I would sing my own versions of Bobani songs, like I had

02:50:48.960 --> 02:50:51.380
my own version of Cowgirl and other things.

02:50:51.380 --> 02:50:54.580
So I think they're wondering if I'm going to do that again, and the answer is no.

02:50:54.580 --> 02:50:56.780
Okay, I have one.

02:50:56.780 --> 02:50:57.780
What?

02:50:57.780 --> 02:51:00.080
Um, your momma says stupid, that's what-

02:51:00.080 --> 02:51:01.780
Wait, wait, wait, I need the music. I need the music.

02:51:01.780 --> 02:51:02.780
Oh, fine.

02:51:02.780 --> 02:51:05.280
I need to hype this up.

02:51:05.280 --> 02:51:09.280
Oh, we have a- oh, I have never heard that Helen Keller joke before in the chatroom there.

02:51:09.280 --> 02:51:13.280
Uh, what did Helen Keller do when she fell off a cliff?

02:51:13.280 --> 02:51:15.280
She screamed her hands off.

02:51:15.280 --> 02:51:16.780
Uh...

02:51:16.780 --> 02:51:18.280
Hahahaha.

02:51:18.280 --> 02:51:19.780
Oh, yeah.

02:51:19.780 --> 02:51:20.780
Hahahaha.

02:51:20.780 --> 02:51:22.780
We're gonna get some angry emails.

02:51:22.780 --> 02:51:24.280
That's alright.

02:51:24.280 --> 02:51:26.780
That's what we do here on the, uh, show.

02:51:26.780 --> 02:51:30.780
Alright, uh, wait, hold on. I wasn't ready to do a Yo Mama Joke of the Week.

02:51:30.780 --> 02:51:32.780
Let's go to your Big Boobs 1 icon.

02:51:32.780 --> 02:51:36.780
Yeah, you probably hit all my music in the Big Boobs folder.

02:51:36.780 --> 02:51:38.780
Peeing in glass bowls or whatever the shit you...

02:51:38.780 --> 02:51:39.780
It's women on stage.

02:51:39.780 --> 02:51:42.780
I'm gonna make out for it by saying a couple of them.

02:51:42.780 --> 02:51:44.780
Alright, kids.

02:51:48.780 --> 02:51:52.780
It's Dark Sakura's Yo Mama Joke of the Week.

02:51:52.780 --> 02:51:53.780
Dark Sakura.

02:51:53.780 --> 02:51:54.780
I have a couple.

02:51:54.780 --> 02:51:59.780
Yo mama so stupid, I told her drinks were on the house so she went and got a ladder.

02:52:02.780 --> 02:52:03.780
And my other one?

02:52:04.780 --> 02:52:07.780
Yo mama so stupid, she took the Pepsi challenge and chose Coke.

02:52:11.780 --> 02:52:14.780
I saw that joke growing because I meant to be Mountain Dew.

02:52:14.780 --> 02:52:19.780
hahahahahahaha

02:52:19.780 --> 02:52:23.780
uh... yo mama so stupid she reckoned a quarterback was a refund

02:52:23.780 --> 02:52:28.780
hahahahahahahahaha

02:52:28.780 --> 02:52:30.780
you're laughing at yourself

02:52:30.780 --> 02:52:33.780
uh... yo mama so stupid she sold her car for gas money

02:52:33.780 --> 02:52:37.780
alright that was like seven yo mama jokes you do one a week here

02:52:37.780 --> 02:52:38.780
I got more

02:52:38.780 --> 02:52:40.780
hell I'm gonna sell my mama for gas money

02:52:40.780 --> 02:52:42.780
alright this one's the best but it's really disgusting

02:52:42.780 --> 02:52:43.780
save it for next week

02:52:43.780 --> 02:52:45.780
I'm gonna tell it right now!

02:52:45.780 --> 02:52:46.780
Nevermind.

02:52:46.780 --> 02:52:48.780
No, tell it right now.

02:52:48.780 --> 02:52:50.780
I promise I won't laugh.

02:52:50.780 --> 02:52:53.780
Yamalasistupu, when you were born, she looked at your umbilical cord and said,

02:52:53.780 --> 02:52:55.780
Well, come to the cable.

02:52:57.780 --> 02:52:59.780
ColorOfSakura wants to know,

02:52:59.780 --> 02:53:04.780
If you could remake any video game from the 16-bit era or earlier, what would it be?

02:53:04.780 --> 02:53:06.780
Guardian Legend!

02:53:06.780 --> 02:53:08.780
Street Fighter 2!

02:53:08.780 --> 02:53:09.780
Repeat the question.

02:53:09.780 --> 02:53:12.780
If you could remake any video game from the 16-bit era or earlier, what would it be?

02:53:12.780 --> 02:53:13.780
or what would it be?

02:53:13.780 --> 02:53:14.780
Kid Icarus.

02:53:14.780 --> 02:53:15.780
I'll say something different then.

02:53:15.780 --> 02:53:16.780
Custer's Revenge.

02:53:16.780 --> 02:53:21.820
You said Street Fighter II, man.

02:53:21.820 --> 02:53:26.340
X-Man.

02:53:26.340 --> 02:53:30.580
I think that they've already remade all the games that I like.

02:53:30.580 --> 02:53:33.020
Oregon Trail.

02:53:33.020 --> 02:53:35.420
You know, like Metroid.

02:53:35.420 --> 02:53:39.620
And the last question we have tonight, Nince wants to know, will Loki singing ever come

02:53:39.620 --> 02:53:42.140
back to the show?

02:53:42.140 --> 02:53:45.140
We actually have to wait for Karaoke Revolution Party to come out, so...

02:53:45.140 --> 02:53:51.140
I hope not, and we don't really have the setup for that, luckily, so, hahaha.

02:53:51.140 --> 02:53:53.140
Well, we can always make it happen.

02:53:53.140 --> 02:53:54.140
No, you can't.

02:53:54.140 --> 02:53:56.140
I think that you should play I'm Stayin' In.

02:53:56.140 --> 02:53:59.140
I don't know if I have it anymore, I gotta dig for it.

02:53:59.140 --> 02:54:01.140
I used to have it somewhere.

02:54:01.140 --> 02:54:04.140
We gotta do a retrospective episode at the end of the year or something, and we'll do it on that.

02:54:04.140 --> 02:54:06.140
What, Logie? What?

02:54:06.140 --> 02:54:10.140
I know where I should put that song, even though I don't want to put that song there.

02:54:10.140 --> 02:54:11.140
Hmm.

02:54:11.140 --> 02:54:14.300
on the thing. Oh, the thing, yeah. Yeah.

02:54:14.300 --> 02:54:19.340
Um, actually it's being suggested by our chat room that we could just use the demo

02:54:19.340 --> 02:54:23.620
in DDR to make, um, Loki sing some crazy in love.

02:54:23.620 --> 02:54:28.660
There's also, um, SingStar, which I have on my hard drive. There you go!

02:54:28.660 --> 02:54:31.920
See, we could do this. We need to get you to sing again.

02:54:31.920 --> 02:54:36.460
We could always pre-record it, you know. You know what we should do is get Loki to go to one of

02:54:36.460 --> 02:54:38.820
those recording studios that they have at the theme park

02:54:38.820 --> 02:54:43.300
and cut his own CD because I did that once and the old radio program I was on

02:54:43.300 --> 02:54:44.460
years ago before the show

02:54:44.460 --> 02:54:47.980
I remember that, I was there. Yeah, I went to Great America,

02:54:47.980 --> 02:54:52.180
Six Flags, oh no it's not Six Flags, it's Paramount's Great America.

02:54:52.180 --> 02:54:55.900
We went to see Margaret Cho. Yeah, it was Paramount's Great America, it was years ago,

02:54:55.900 --> 02:54:59.500
it was Gay Day at Great America. I got hit on by girls in the bathroom.

02:54:59.500 --> 02:55:04.140
Because it was Gay Day and so you know Dark Soccer being one of my fag hags, she had to go

02:55:04.140 --> 02:55:08.660
and we went and there was one of those rooms where you could record your own

02:55:08.660 --> 02:55:14.700
CD. I've been in those things before. I sang Like a Prayer by Madonna. I sang Save the

02:55:14.700 --> 02:55:24.700
Best for Last by what's-her-name. Penthouse model, American beauty queen. Vanessa Williams.

02:55:24.700 --> 02:55:33.940
So, I recorded this song and then somehow the CD fell into the hands of Travis, who

02:55:33.940 --> 02:55:38.280
was the host over on Understation Live, and every week he would play that song to make

02:55:38.280 --> 02:55:46.760
fun of it so I don't know alright I think it's about time to wrap up the

02:55:46.760 --> 02:55:52.240
show boys and girls we're done shows over I know sadness huh first off all

02:55:52.240 --> 02:55:56.080
right now yeah if you want you can go cry I've never stayed through a whole

02:55:56.080 --> 02:56:01.480
show before I know you are a special guest tonight extra special guest extra

02:56:01.480 --> 02:56:04.840
special our chat room seems to like you some of them they do some of them think

02:56:04.840 --> 02:56:07.160
we should add you on permanently, and to that I say...

02:56:07.160 --> 02:56:12.160
You gave us the bleached asshole joke. What was that?

02:56:12.160 --> 02:56:16.800
You gave us the bleached asshole joke. I did give you that bleached asshole joke.

02:56:16.800 --> 02:56:23.800
And taking immense pride over that. That is really funny. Keep doing that.

02:56:24.160 --> 02:56:27.400
Alright, let's go around. I am going to choke that ferret.

02:56:27.400 --> 02:56:31.840
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

02:56:31.840 --> 02:56:37.600
We sent Zero on fire and sent him back to his flea infested- I'm sorry, did I say that

02:56:37.600 --> 02:56:38.600
on the air?

02:56:38.600 --> 02:56:41.240
We sent him back to live in a hole.

02:56:41.240 --> 02:56:45.520
Xtavor, your final thought.

02:56:45.520 --> 02:56:51.400
Akira Yamamoka should be a drink called Akira Yamamoka.

02:56:51.400 --> 02:56:58.440
Wait, did I pronounce his name right?

02:56:58.440 --> 02:56:59.720
I hate you.

02:56:59.720 --> 02:57:05.040
uh... loki your final thought

02:57:05.040 --> 02:57:09.400
except for a hand on the god damn microphone

02:57:09.400 --> 02:57:11.840
loki turn on the god damn microphone

02:57:11.840 --> 02:57:13.520
it's all his fault

02:57:13.520 --> 02:57:17.120
this is why you're never going to be on the show, never

02:57:17.120 --> 02:57:19.720
ever ever

02:57:19.720 --> 02:57:24.000
no one can hear you because you don't have the microphone

02:57:24.000 --> 02:57:26.320
my final thought is uh...

02:57:26.320 --> 02:57:29.620
to finish the thing but it's done pretty much

02:57:29.620 --> 02:57:32.620
okay, super

02:57:32.620 --> 02:57:36.220
and my final thought just for you chat room you bitches

02:57:39.740 --> 02:57:42.340
polovestian? polovestian

02:57:42.340 --> 02:57:44.120

02:57:50.720 --> 02:57:52.340

02:57:52.340 --> 02:57:54.860
One word to sum it all up, the final...
