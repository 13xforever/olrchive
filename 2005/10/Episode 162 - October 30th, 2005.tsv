331642	332143	Jamie Summers.
333803	334403	That was lovely.
334683	335624	It tasted like burrito.
337144	338244	It tastes like burning.
339245	340505	No, it tasted like burrito.
340525	341085	You know what's funny?
341125	345446	I think your mic faded out right at the point where you burped, so it didn't pick it up even, which is great.
345866	346467	Burp!
346667	347207	There you go.
348527	350568	Also with us tonight, say hello to TechMassaloki.
350588	351008	Hi.
352250	352710	How you doing?
353051	353291	Good.
354272	356994	You seem a little withdrawn tonight, giving me one-word answers.
357894	360356	I don't know, I just haven't gotten into the show yet.
360416	362218	Are you committed to this program?
362678	362938	Yes.
364139	364660	You better be.
364900	365220	Alright.
366021	371585	Also with us tonight, say hello to the crazy, the delusional, but the very funny, Extifer.
372846	373367	Yo, yo.
374127	374908	How you doing, Extifer?
375448	378130	I'm doing great with a side of good.
380312	381153	That's wonderful to hear.
382283	385365	Also with us tonight, say hello to Miss DDR Angel.
385565	385805	Hello.
385865	386585	How you doing?
386966	388506	I'm good.
389507	393729	Yeah, I've got a lot of stuff to talk about, but I guess we can talk about that later.
393749	394069	Good!
394109	398271	Because I have news about said convention from this weekend.
398311	399372	Hint, elbow, hint.
399432	400432	Did you go to BlizzCon?
400612	401053	No, I didn't.
401213	401333	Oh.
401393	402733	I know a lot of news about it.
402753	403994	I was like, the fuck?
404034	406155	We had representation at BlizzCon?
406976	407016	Um...
407896	408376	Sort of.
408756	414139	I kind of had my ins as far as finding out about stuff even though I wasn't there.
414419	415239	Like, does that make sense?
415480	417240	Okay, I gotcha.
418241	422383	I'll talk about my relationship with Blizzard Entertainment in a little while.
423243	424404	We'll talk about that when we come back.
424424	425024	How's that sound?
425124	425644	No, that's fine.
425684	435309	I just wanted to, like, you know... No, I love Blizzard now, which is ironic because I used to think they were so overrated, but ever since I started playing World of Warcraft and can't fucking stop...
435989	439371	I'm suddenly like, ooh, I want to go to BlizzCon!
439411	444112	No, no, I will not tell you what I ran last, er, like, 15 minutes ago.
444453	444693	What?
445213	446713	Zofarok, you don't want to run that.
447054	447334	What?
447354	453816	It's called Zofarok, it's like, yeah, like this really big instance thing, and it hurts in the end.
454056	455897	Isn't that that new movie, like Jumanji?
458898	460979	Or is that the medication you take when you're depressed?
461119	462740	That's a lot, I don't know.
463460	464181	DarkSakura
487926	492709	I don't even know if what she's got on the screen is related to the show.
492769	495811	I'm looking at Playgirl models.
497873	499113	Let's go to a break, kids.
499173	502095	We'll be back after this with more... I'm looking at naked Daryl Hannah.
503636	503996	Oh, sorry.
504157	506718	I'm actually going to be ordering Clint at the cave fair.
507639	508439	You guys are so weird.
508459	509460	And Iguana Girl says hi.
510000	511281	Oh, right on.
511982	513903	Is her people hair gray and wiry?
515066	515346	What?
515927	516727	Daryl Hannah.
517268	517828	I don't know.
518469	519930	Oh, I thought you were talking about Iguana Girl.
519970	520531	I was like, what?
520671	521511	Oh, no, no, no, no.
521671	523053	I was talking about Daryl Hannah.
524234	527296	But is Iguana Girls... No, I'm kidding.
528517	529658	On that note, let's go to a break.
532153	533174	And we'll be back after this.
533234	541704	And we might actually talk about some music game stuff, because apparently Ultramix 3, the song list released, and there's a concert coming to town, and all this other garbage I want to talk about too.
541964	542765	We'll be back after this.
543005	544667	Oh, join our chat room, won't you?
544807	546529	OrangeLoungeRadio.com, click on chat.
546990	551014	We'll start it off this break with a little bit of Taku from 2DX4Style.
551154	551555	Enjoy.
614222	615187	Thank you for watching!
926724	931025	Gaming Radio, so uncensored that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.
931125	931945	Orange Lounge Radio.
955117	957321	Hi, we're here.
957401	958402	I like burritos, Rob.
959175	959595	Do you?
959775	960256	That's good to hear.
960376	961396	It sounds like it.
961596	962597	I mean, literally.
962837	963897	It smells like it, too.
964578	965298	We all know.
965798	967379	That mic's getting retired before the end of the night.
967399	968500	I don't know what's going on with it.
968540	970821	Hi, this microphone sucks a big chunk of ass.
970941	971881	Oh, that's what it is.
971901	973362	Do you want me to pick up a new mic?
974022	974623	Are you going to Target?
974643	975643	And you can reimburse me?
976243	976604	F yes.
976664	978084	Go to Target and get a new mic.
979285	980505	That's awesome.
981486	982667	I'm so awesome, aren't I?
982927	983707	You're okay.
984467	984567	Aww.
986297	987759	Alright, so we'll get that fixed.
987779	989561	Good, that means I'll be fixed before the podcast.
989581	990182	That makes me happy.
991524	991965	So anyway.
993426	994348	Wow, that kind of threw me.
995149	999555	I just think it would be really funny if one day we were at a break and then we just didn't come back.
1000956	1002999	You just kind of hear the music in the background and we're not there.
1003905	1005226	Actually, maybe we already pulled that rank.
1005246	1005546	I don't know.
1006146	1008327	Anyway, hi, you're listening to Orange Sounds Radio.
1008347	1008727	We are here.
1008747	1009247	We are live.
1009348	1015770	I noticed, just judging from the names I see in chat room, we have quite a few people tonight who haven't listened before.
1016291	1023634	And judging from what's been going on in general in the past 10 months, we have more and more people listening to us thanks to our podcast, which I think, you know, that's awesome.
1023694	1025115	That was the whole idea.
1025155	1031878	We did a podcast in the first place because we were like, oh, maybe we'll get like two or three people listening to the podcast that will come over and then listen to our live show.
1032378	1036581	And then the fucking podcast gets like 40 times the listeners our live show gets.
1036641	1037301	It's crazy.
1037741	1038542	But it's cool.
1038562	1038922	We love it.
1038962	1042784	We love the fact that people are listening to it and just loving it.
1043165	1044946	But I do got to warn people.
1045899	1046580	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1070922	1072683	What's happened to the DDR Freak boards?
1072783	1073303	It's like this.
1073383	1079126	It's like, we're dedicated, this show is dedicated to music games like MTV is dedicated to music.
1079206	1080847	Yes, that's a great analogy.
1082868	1084309	We are the MTV of music gaming.
1084529	1087470	I can't really say anything too bad about the DDR Freak boards, though.
1087550	1089011	No, I'm not saying a negative thing at all.
1089031	1092293	No, no, no, not just because I moderate there, but because I've seen worse.
1093061	1093341	Oh, yeah.
1093581	1093801	No, no.
1094182	1094902	I'm not saying anything.
1094922	1098403	I mean, if I wanted to say something negative about the DDR Freak Boards, I'd go to a different topic.
1098483	1109809	But the DDR Freak Boards in general, if you notice where the majority of posts are, well, maybe not the majority, but the real active users and the long-time users all kind of flock to one forum.
1110649	1111409	Random chat.
1112870	1115171	So we are the random chat of the Internet.
1115251	1115611	I don't know.
1116612	1118833	Random chat lately is the bane of my existence.
1121514	1121794	Anyway.
1124195	1125435	That is a great analogy.
1125495	1126415	I'm sorry, that was great.
1126435	1128556	We're like MTV is to music.
1129996	1132277	Anyway, oh, even the chat room agrees.
1132617	1134717	Loki wins the show, says MPQ.
1134797	1135157	Good job.
1135517	1136778	G4 is going the same way.
1137558	1139138	G4 has nothing to do with Games Day.
1139158	1144079	G4 is young man television, and it's a stretch of that.
1144199	1145640	I'm confused by G4.
1146060	1146780	They confuse me.
1147200	1149040	First off, why are they playing Fastlane?
1149060	1152201	Because that show shouldn't be on air at any station.
1152563	1152843	DJ Ranma S
1172813	1176954	You know, just because there was a lesbian couple in Wonderfalls, they put on the whole show.
1177534	1178995	Logo, by the way, being the gay and lesbian.
1179015	1179655	Yeah, gay and lesbian.
1179715	1180175	I'm sorry.
1180535	1187037	For all of you people that don't like to be fucked up the ass, Logo is for gay people.
1187137	1189157	Okay.
1189637	1191017	My mother watches Logo.
1191358	1192518	It's not just for gay people.
1192578	1193418	It's about gay people.
1193478	1195299	Some people don't have cable.
1196419	1198339	Some of us have to live with Core TV.
1198939	1199900	So it's like Bravo?
1202941	1203901	Psychic Detectives.
1204382	1207643	No, Bravo is somehow gayer than Logo still.
1207883	1213825	I mean, honestly, fucking A. Project Runway is like the equivalent of an all-male gangbang.
1213905	1217286	I don't know if you've ever watched this show, Project Runway.
1218147	1218907	It's gay.
1219327	1224409	I mean, it's like 10 Madonna videos all back-to-back is what Project Runway is.
1224449	1225129	It is gay.
1225750	1227270	Every guy on that show is gay.
1227890	1229311	It's gay, gay, gay, gay, gay.
1231004	1233107	And see, but since I'm gay, I can say that.
1233207	1237774	Because it's like that episode of South Park where Mr. Garrison goes around and calls everybody a fag because he's gay.
1237814	1240578	That's where I can get away saying that, too.
1242901	1243122	Anyway.
1245516	1250758	Dark Sakura, if your microphone will cooperate with you through this segment, how was your week, how was your day?
1275489	1277310	Well, actually, how was the past two weeks?
1277490	1277970	That's true.
1279512	1280072	Excuse me.
1280712	1283014	I ate a burrito, and burritos make me burp.
1283835	1285036	I'm also drinking Tab.
1286597	1288218	Tab is like the ultimate drink of the year.
1288238	1290219	Why the fuck are you voluntarily drinking Tab?
1290980	1293762	Because the 80s are making a comeback, and not in a good way.
1296969	1303034	If I was on, like, Survivor, and they offered Tab in a reward challenge, I'd be all, fuck you, I'll starve.
1303355	1303955	Seriously.
1304215	1305877	I'll drink sand, thank you.
1306197	1311562	I would honestly rather drink ocean water that all the fish have crapped in than Tab.
1313583	1315985	But Tab is tabulous.
1317026	1317787	Fantabulous.
1318629	1320670	You know tab backwards is bat?
1321151	1323632	And that's exactly what it tastes like, blended bat.
1325633	1325893	Rob.
1326574	1326814	What?
1326954	1327174	Dear.
1327554	1327755	Yes?
1327835	1329135	Your analogy sucked ass.
1329295	1329596	I know.
1329736	1333118	I'm trying to compete with Loki tonight in the analogy department.
1337380	1340482	I just got an IM that says you're drinking tab?
1340502	1341002	Yes!
1341063	1345005	That's right, you'd get her.
1345345	1348027	That's almost as bad as, what was that, Tang or...
1349653	1353294	The Drink of the Astronauts, Take to the Moon, Astronauts, Moon!
1353835	1359457	Notice how Tab was conspicuously left out of all three I Love the 80s series on VH1?
1360337	1360817	You know why?
1360997	1362358	Because no one loved Tab.
1362658	1363798	No one loved Tab at all.
1363818	1364439	I love Tab.
1365259	1368020	It tastes, like, gross, but I like it.
1368160	1371741	You know what's sad is I woke up this morning... Hey!
1372722	1373382	What about my week?
1373971	1384498	Well, we were on the tangent of I Love the 80s, so I was saying, I woke up this morning and I was wondering, how long after it becomes, you know, 2011, will it take VH1 to make the I Love 2000?
1386500	1388401	I was just like... Well, we already have it.
1388501	1389702	It's that show Best Week Ever.
1389882	1393285	I don't know if you've watched Best Week Ever, but it's basically I Love the Last Week.
1394065	1396827	It's the premise of the show, I Love the Last Week.
1396867	1400310	But you know what drink that we need to have come back besides Crystal Pepsi and Josta?
1403562	1406925	If you say Pepsi Blue, I'm leaving the show.
1407165	1409147	Because I cannot stand Pepsi Blue.
1409367	1410168	Pepsi Blue too.
1411108	1411949	Pepsi Blue.
1412209	1414031	But Tab makes me think of Back to the Future.
1414051	1418415	Where he goes into the bar, another little diner, and says, Give me a Tab.
1418875	1420156	You haven't ordered anything yet.
1420176	1421017	You can't have a Tab.
1421497	1422618	Okay, then a Pepsi free.
1423139	1425501	Look, if you're going to have a Pepsi, you have to pay for it.
1428724	1429004	Ha ha.
1430443	1432984	The only thing I can think of that's worse than Tab is Pepsi Blue.
1433705	1434105	Nasty.
1434305	1437827	Like, if that were the reward on Survivor, I'd swish it and spit it at the host.
1438047	1438787	It's that awful.
1438827	1440228	Pepsi Blue is god-awful.
1441669	1442369	Dr. Pepper.
1442409	1443349	Vanilla Dr. Pepper.
1443590	1443790	Ew.
1444510	1447111	The prairie vanilla Dr. Pepper is the nastiest shit ever.
1447171	1447451	Okay.
1448632	1453314	I don't know when we started becoming the soft drink show, but I have to say this.
1455726	1459211	This friend of mine made the best analogy about that diet cherry vanilla, Dr. Pepper.
1459751	1464298	It doesn't taste like cherry, and it doesn't taste like vanilla, and it really doesn't taste like Dr. Pepper.
1465099	1466381	I don't know what that's supposed to be.
1468484	1471047	It's like all three of the flavors cancel each other out.
1471467	1473048	And suddenly you've got like Tab.
1473269	1473609	Anyway.
1474350	1476672	Roz just told me that Blue Pepsi tasted like medicine.
1477333	1480536	Blue Pep... I would rather drink a bottle of Dayquil.
1480696	1482137	I said it looked like a toilet bowl.
1482337	1483479	I liked Blue Pepsi.
1483739	1484660	Oh my god!
1484740	1485320	Am I weird?
1485340	1486241	Don't kill yourself.
1486401	1488964	Okay, my week was eventful.
1490025	1491727	I got to stay on a bus.
1492941	1497344	and go to San Francisco on a bus for my field trip last Sunday.
1498524	1502827	And I just sort of played with my puppies on the way and ignored the teacher.
1504388	1510011	But he was giving us a history of different locations on the way in San Francisco and everything, and it was kind of cool.
1510611	1511172	Wait a minute, wait a minute.
1511192	1512332	But we hardly got out of the bus.
1512452	1513113	Hold up, hold up.
1514694	1517656	The last time I went on a field trip, I was in the 11th grade.
1519850	1521991	I did not know that they did field trips in college.
1522231	1522411	What?
1522691	1522851	What?
1523191	1526653	I've never... They also do camping trips for like single credits and everything.
1526753	1527413	The hell?
1529014	1531595	If you could take bowling as a sport, they have field trips.
1531895	1533796	This is for cultural geography, so we went over...
1534329	1537951	The different settlements and we went by the first mission in San Francisco.
1538771	1542854	And we also went by, this is my favorite place and I've always wanted to get out and go there.
1542894	1544655	It's by the Exploratorium.
1545535	1549037	The Palace of Fine Art that was there since the World's Fair in 1915.
1549257	1552819	The last standing structure from the World's Fair in 1915.
1553840	1558562	And just listening to how most of San Francisco is built on landfill.
1559342	1560803	Like, oh, we have an earthquake.
1560843	1563485	Let's just use all this crap to fill up a lake and build houses on it.
1564125	1565286	Without any real engineering.
1565967	1567848	Really makes me want to live in San Francisco.
1568308	1568569	Yeah.
1568849	1571151	Did you go to the Exploratorium also?
1571391	1571771	No, we didn't.
1571791	1572151	We went.
1572191	1573092	We used their bathroom twice.
1573653	1573793	Oh.
1575014	1576295	I like the Exploratorium.
1576315	1576675	I do too.
1576875	1579677	Yeah, I liked it at the very, very back where nobody really went.
1579757	1588904	And you know, you have that big screen where if you dance in front of it, you can see yourself like a silhouette of yourself on the screen dancing and it changes all sorts of colors.
1588924	1589565	You know what I'm talking about?
1589585	1590706	They have a place like that in Mobile.
1590766	1592007	It's actually just called the Explorium.
1592407	1592667	Oh, really?
1592687	1595390	It's in downtown Mobile, built out of, I think, the old city hall.
1595930	1596991	But they have a screen like that.
1597031	1599733	You can do the weird prismatic shapes and everything.
1599813	1600314	That's cool.
1600334	1602536	They used to have animatronic dinosaurs there, too.
1604554	1605994	Thank you for watching.
1606134	1606735	See you next time.
1626080	1626780	I took pictures.
1626940	1629301	I can put them somewhere for people, I guess.
1630662	1632522	But yeah, that's what I did on Sunday.
1632542	1636383	The rest of my week has just been work and school and going to the chiropractor.
1637464	1639744	My insurance paid for me one of those exercise balls.
1640865	1641165	Awesome.
1641425	1642425	So I've been using it.
1644006	1651048	And my husband's going on South Beach next week, so I'm going back to phase one on it with him.
1651748	1654349	So you're going to be hearing me next week going, I'm hungry!
1655470	1656130	I need a burrito.
1656571	1657971	I'll be sitting here eating Pizza Hut.
1659272	1660993	Actually, I can eat California Pizza Kitchen.
1661153	1661473	Can you?
1661873	1663374	Because they don't bleach their flour.
1663774	1665695	That's some good stuff at restaurants, too.
1666535	1678581	But, um... But, um, at any rate, I was so worn out that day that when we got onto the Bay Bridge to go back, I opened my eyes again in Vallejo.
1679662	1682483	So, yeah, I was pretty much dead.
1684064	1684624	And, uh...
1687279	1690500	Really, the rest of my week has just been crap.
1691481	1694322	Well, we did watch Batman Begins again, and I sprained my wrist.
1696143	1698984	Wait a minute, how did you sprain your wrist watching Batman Begins?
1699004	1701945	I was drinking, and I got up off the floor.
1705326	1706747	Does Christian Bale do it for you?
1708688	1712589	Well, actually, in that movie, yeah.
1712649	1716791	I was getting up off the floor, and I pushed my hand down and hyperextended my wrist.
1718117	1719358	Were you going to show them the Batcave?
1723241	1731047	Listeners, I'm going to give you a play-by-play of me winding up this skin from Chipotle and throwing it at Robin, hitting him in the face, which I just did.
1734229	1735810	Naughty, naughty boy!
1735830	1737251	Yeah, but funny.
1737592	1738592	That's the important thing, funny.
1739573	1740033	I made it funny.
1740053	1741875	You're just pissed off because I made it funny at your expense.
1743256	1743516	No.
1744016	1744937	Bitch, you know I'm right.
1745778	1746118	Bitch?
1746438	1747479	Who do you call a bitch, bitch?
1751994	1755435	We were going to play Katamari last night, but we went out to TGR Fridays instead.
1759176	1761657	I'm so glad we have you on this video gaming station.
1761937	1762217	What?
1763977	1765158	I was going to play a video game, but...
1766513	1767333	I want to go eat instead.
1767353	1769174	Well, it was good.
1769494	1769894	It's fine.
1770014	1773295	And we ended up... Dan was watching The Job.
1773915	1774855	It has Dennis Leary.
1775756	1777636	I hate that show, but I love Dennis Leary.
1778836	1781477	I loathe just about every character on that show.
1782838	1786639	The last thing that I liked that I loathed every character on was Chicago.
1787639	1788119	But that's it.
1788719	1794241	Okay, I'm done since you're not wasting all my time talking about stuff.
1794781	1795361	You know you love it.
1796394	1797054	That's what we do.
1797254	1797515	Loki.
1797595	1798095	Oh, baby.
1798335	1798995	Loki, how was your week?
1799015	1799376	How was your day?
1800616	1804318	Well, my week was weird, and my day was weird.
1805359	1808481	The entire week was filled up with two things, and it's really strange.
1809241	1815164	Myself playing the game The Warriors and watching the first season of Desperate Housewives.
1815244	1820547	And I don't know how those two combined, but that's... I don't get it.
1820767	1823489	Dude, you actually sat through the whole first season of Desperate Housewives?
1824130	1824890	Not voluntarily.
1825470	1827011	Nellie was watching Desperate Housewives.
1827191	1828631	I was programming the webpage.
1829852	1833593	In a sense, I did sit through the whole first season of Desperate Housewives.
1836514	1836874	I don't know.
1838154	1839075	I have breaking news.
1839395	1839575	What?
1839675	1841015	I just found $2 in my pocket.
1841556	1842656	Congratulations.
1843416	1845777	That's your payment for doing this show for the past three and a half years.
1846528	1850011	Dude, someone actually sent me a dollar.
1850812	1851172	What?
1851753	1854535	You know how in the intro it says, give her a dollar?
1854635	1854975	Yeah.
1855055	1856457	Someone actually mailed me a dollar.
1858338	1860240	Wait, you gave somebody your address?
1860260	1861701	It was somebody I knew anyway.
1861761	1862141	Oh, okay.
1862161	1864263	He was listening to the show and he mailed me a dollar.
1864283	1865024	Awesome.
1866225	1868067	Dude, we're going to be rich doing this program.
1868967	1870429	Get all the listeners to send us a dollar.
1870489	1871730	Then we'd have like five dollars.
1874631	1875192	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1895779	1896499	That's all I have to say.
1896579	1896980	Interesting.
1897180	1901882	The whole scope of the show, they have one character at least that someone can identify with.
1901902	1904823	They have the four different type of women and stuff like that.
1905383	1907184	So, I don't know.
1907404	1909465	It's not a bad show.
1909525	1916828	It's well written, I guess, but not exactly something that most heterosexual males would be caught dead watching.
1919109	1920709	I don't know.
1920890	1924251	For me, it had the same feel as Dead Like Me and Wonderfall's.
1924687	1952687	You know, the same type of thing, where each show has like a theme to it, that type of thing Oh shit, Extra Pro, we're missing out, those two shows are great So, that's what it, I mean, I've got the DVD set, got it for free, thank God, I didn't pay for it So yeah, guess what is up next, I have to watch Season 1 of Lost now I really don't want to sit through that, so, but, whatever Anyways, so yeah, it's been that, working on the webpage, playing the Warriors And not getting to play any other games I wanted to play, because, you know, the TV is being taken up
1953692	1957074	So what did you do for the website?
1957914	1966558	I created a wonderful kick-ass shout box for our PSP site with a nice virtual keyboard on there and everything.
1966638	1967238	It looks pretty.
1967759	1973681	Yeah, so you can go there and give us a shout out over on olrpsp.com.
1974022	1976643	But again, that website is really for viewing on your PSP.
1976863	1978984	It'll work in a normal browser, but it looks ugly.
1979935	1981698	It doesn't look as pretty, let's put it that way.
1981718	1985604	Yeah, it is still pretty, but it's prettier if you look at it on PSP.
1986045	1987266	Because it's made for the PSP.
1988268	1990912	In fact, it looks better than our regular website, I gotta say.
1992735	1993015	Oh well.
1993075	1993396	Sorry.
1993777	1994598	That's alright, what can you do?
1995506	1998388	But yeah, that's pretty much what I've been doing this week.
1999089	2004773	Just lots of work and trying to put some video games in there.
2005394	2007856	Play Grand Theft Auto Liberty Stories for all five minutes.
2008516	2011058	That's about all the attention that I can dedicate to that game.
2011459	2012099	Is it that bad?
2012660	2014581	No, I just can't dedicate enough attention to the game.
2014661	2015782	Too busy watching Desperate Housewives?
2015802	2018604	I'm too busy doing tons of stuff.
2019045	2019365	I don't know.
2020034	2025944	Liberty City Stories, it's like, I don't even have time for most of the stuff on the PSP, so, I don't know.
2027386	2028508	It'll be fun playing multiplayer, though.
2028528	2029590	Alright, I'm done.
2031570	2034612	I guess I'll talk about my week real fast, then we'll get to our guests, and they can talk about their week.
2036273	2037294	My week was okay.
2037374	2042898	It was actually really busy, because I had an awful lot of work stuff this week, and I was even there one night until like 7 o'clock, and that's just sad.
2044379	2046261	So I haven't really gotten a chance to do a whole lot else.
2046281	2048902	I did buy some new games, and I'll talk about those on this week's podcast.
2049443	2051624	Soul Calibur III I've been playing an awful lot of, as well as...
2053125	2056248	Midway Arcade Treasures 3, which Loki gave me last week.
2056588	2062152	And I started playing Taito, but I'm going to save that for the week after podcast because I didn't get to play it really enough.
2062652	2064213	So I'm going to talk about those games.
2064814	2067676	And not a whole lot else, really.
2069097	2080345	You know, I didn't do a lot for Halloween, which is kind of, even though Halloween's technically tomorrow, I've really done a lot for Halloween, which is kind of too bad, except playing World of Warcraft and trick-or-treating inside of World of Warcraft, which is really nerdy.
2080985	2081045	Um...
2081786	2082267	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2098684	2101405	And it's one of those towns where the college pretty much runs the town.
2101445	2105647	So, you know, like the keg is the national flower and stuff in Chico.
2105827	2107928	So it was good times, though.
2108048	2108488	Good times.
2108848	2110169	You know, just did a little bit of drinking.
2110329	2111229	Good times.
2111830	2113911	We drank butterbeer, like Harry Potter.
2113931	2114891	You know how they had the butterbeer?
2115371	2115971	We drank butterbeer.
2115991	2116992	You know what they put in butterbeer?
2117893	2118413	What is that?
2118473	2121577	Butterscotch schnapps, root beer, and vodka.
2122398	2131909	You know, when we went to the party last year, the one that Rice Princess threw, we had the butter beer there, and it was actually really good.
2132890	2136775	Everything there was really good, and then I got sick and put in the hospital the next day.
2138502	2140344	Xtifer had two major surgeries last year.
2161212	2162873	I did have two major surgeries last week.
2162893	2164314	Maybe he didn't want me to say that on the show.
2164894	2168696	Well, no, it's okay to say that.
2168896	2169596	I'm fine with it.
2170617	2171757	I'm over it.
2172038	2173018	Extrovert's been cut up.
2173318	2175980	I have been cut up.
2176060	2177901	Lost a gallbladder, lost an appendix.
2178001	2180782	I'm 10% less Christopher than you saw before that.
2182703	2184444	I have room in me to stuff things.
2185825	2186585	Good, you'll need that.
2187485	2188586	Like cocaine and stuff.
2189748	2190408	So is it my turn?
2190828	2191489	Yeah, how was your week?
2191509	2191849	How was your day?
2192049	2202553	Okay, well, while Loki was getting in touch with his feminine side, I was, you know, doing my show on Monday, and I had a really good turnout.
2203273	2208255	Lots of listeners, 14 listeners, which was really good.
2209056	2214638	And I enjoyed it, and I can't wait to do it again tomorrow and stuff.
2215818	2219401	And also, I played an assload of World of Warcraft this week.
2220742	2221322	Addict.
2221563	2226406	I know, it's almost too sad to really talk about.
2227287	2233792	Yesterday, I went to a movie, which I guess I'll get to later on in the show.
2234573	2238416	Let's just say I saw a movie with my sister.
2238716	2240978	My sister saw it, too!
2243504	2245326	Okay?
2246287	2251192	So, you may want to look forward to my movie review later on.
2251572	2253754	It'll be spectabulous.
2256637	2256917	All right.
2257097	2258459	Like, it'll be tabulous.
2258819	2259640	Like, tab.
2259680	2260661	Give the microphone to Angel.
2260821	2261021	Okay.
2261341	2261742	There you go.
2262082	2262823	Angel, how was your week?
2262843	2263283	How was your day?
2263363	2263784	Mine?
2263984	2266386	Oh, pretty good.
2268038	2271721	Thank you for watching, and I'll see you next time.
2284680	2285260	Uh-huh?
2285300	2290045	Jamie allows yourself to get tied up with chatting with our chatters at OrangeLiveJournal.com.
2290485	2293408	I really want my friends to listen to LiveJournal.
2293849	2296111	Okay, I really don't want to know what that is.
2296191	2297312	Did you paste that in chat?
2297592	2298013	Yes, I did.
2298073	2301156	It's a birthday cake with a giant cock on it, basically.
2301176	2302878	And it has piercings with a cock ring.
2302898	2304439	I'm not talking about a chicken.
2308523	2310905	Nice that she did that right when I have the mic.
2310925	2311705	It's balls look horrible.
2312105	2313827	That's not fair!
2313847	2317169	It's balls look diseased or something.
2317949	2319470	The balls look like kushes.
2320291	2321011	I mean, seriously.
2321031	2322232	Anyway, Abel, please continue.
2322252	2323052	I'm sorry, Abel.
2324313	2325334	Now I forgot what I was saying.
2325834	2326254	Damn it.
2326855	2327235	Damn it.
2327415	2327695	Okay.
2328876	2329416	Well, yeah.
2329777	2335600	I had a lot of school stuff to do, but then other than that, it was pretty much gearing up for BlizzCon, even though I didn't really go, but I...
2336761	2337722	Know a lot of stuff now.
2338462	2339103	After the fact.
2340063	2341484	We can get to that later if you wish.
2341564	2341864	Sure.
2342064	2344766	Considering there's a lot of stuff to talk about.
2346847	2348468	I played a lot of World of Warcraft.
2348528	2351910	I shouldn't have, but I did and it was fun.
2352071	2354732	All the cool kids play World of Warcraft now.
2354992	2356173	I'm going to pull an extrovert here.
2356493	2363718	When we talk about World of Warcraft, the fact that we're going to be bringing it up, it might have your ears burning.
2365819	2369827	and then we'll be on a crusade later to tell you all the latest information.
2372569	2375250	I bet it was interesting to see.

2378830	2379150	Shut up.
2379951	2380411	Sorry, Angel.

2463941	2464221	Anyway.
2465482	2466162	Well, that too.
2466563	2467283	Shut up.
2468224	2468864	Shut up.
2469144	2469445	Woo.
2469465	2470385	All right.

2474008	2474728	Great radio, gang.
2475129	2475629	Great radio.
2476029	2476590	Website again.
2476650	2478391	Anyway.
2479572	2481033	That's it, I guess.
2482254	2482594	Yeah, bye.
2483803	2489867	We should have a show or something where we just watch a movie and all it is is just our reactions to it.
2490448	2493190	Like, oh my god, what'd you do?
2493290	2494610	Oh my god, take that out!
2494711	2495991	Take that out!
2496011	2497512	Do not go back there!
2497673	2499694	Oh my god, not in the Batcave!
2500134	2501115	Oh no, no!
2502996	2504557	And then make all my bodies to jump!
2506178	2507159	Not in the back door!
2507359	2508340	Don't go in the back door!
2511997	2513358	Oh my god, she's been backdoored!
2518942	2519603	Alright, anyway.
2520844	2522345	I think this show's in need of a break.
2522445	2525547	And when we come back from this break, we're going to talk about some actual video game related things.
2526068	2528790	I want to talk about Ultramix 3, because there's a whole shitload of news on Ultramix 3.
2529610	2533053	And then we're going to talk a little bit about the Burning Crusade.
2534033	2534754	Hot.
2535194	2539518	Because now that we've all become World of Warcraft whores, we have to dedicate a little piece of our show to that.
2539738	2540178	Hot.
2540698	2541059	Thank you.

3042751	3044831	We're on Orange Lounge Radio here again.
3045351	3047251	Another week, another Sunday, another show.
3048251	3050012	Our 162nd show.
3050692	3051872	If you can believe it.
3052652	3053412	God, I'm old.
3053612	3054112	No, just kidding.
3054252	3055353	Not counting the half shows.
3056053	3056913	Yes, very true.
3057527	3057991	DarkSakura.com
3059804	3062005	I'm old as far as shows.
3062605	3062905	Yeah.
3063405	3064545	You've been here since what?
3064705	3064545	37.
3064725	3066926	37?
3064825	3066926	I thought it was 27.
3067046	3067306	No.
3067846	3068366	Oh, wait.
3069246	3069526	Oh, well.
3069946	3071107	A long time.
3071427	3071107	27.
3071987	3072307	Sorry.
3073007	3076808	Um, again, ever since, you know, God, when did we start doing the podcast?
3076968	3080929	It was January of this year, so it was like around 110 or so in show numbers.
3081529	3082429	No, I just, no, not that.
3082489	3083870	I guess it would be sooner than that, about 120, 130.
3084190	3087391	Um, it was when we really started getting a lot of new people.
3087431	3088011	Gee, I wonder why.
3088551	3088631	Uh...
3088971	3089932	www.DarkSakura.com
3110194	3128523	And also, we just announced this last week, so some of you guys might have missed this, but now, not only can you call in over the Skype line by calling our username at Orange Lounge Radio, but you can actually call us on the phone, 916-226-9067 is the Orange Lounge Radio number, so you'll be able to call in to that very soon.
3128903	3129623	So, very cool.
3130183	3131604	You missed that, Jamie, that was last week.
3131644	3133305	We have an actual number now.
3134766	3141411	So we can get even more people calling in and telling us to go fuck ourselves.
3142052	3143954	Anyway, 916-226-9067.
3144915	3145995	Don't call yet, we're not answering.
3148638	3152501	Let's see, we also have our chat room going on, www.orangeentrader.com.
3152541	3159467	Click on chat and you can see all these folks chatting, including Dirty Thief, who keeps wanting to get me to say his name.
3159867	3160468	So there you have it.
3161229	3161609	I said it.
3164294	3174586	Dan's Dance Revolution Ultra Mix 3 is on its way out and they've been taking it out on tour.
3174646	3179811	I don't know if you guys heard about the Konami tour, but Konami's going around and touring the nation right now.
3180492	3183235	And when I say nation, I mean a couple of select states.
3184376	3190738	They already did the ones in California, but neglected to tell anybody that it was going on in the DDR community, so none of us thought to go out.
3191318	3194819	But it was in Southern California anyway, so we here at OLR wouldn't have been able to go.
3195219	3202661	But right now, this past weekend, they have been in Texas, and they were in Texas today, and that's the last opportunity to catch them in Texas.
3203222	3207003	However, they're going to go to Illinois over November 4th, 5th, and 6th.
3208764	3211767	And then they'll be in Massachusetts, 11th, 12th, and 13th.
3212107	3218614	And then the New York, New Jersey area, mostly New Jersey, 18th, 19th, and 20th of November.
3218894	3223199	So if you want to check out the exact locations, we've got them posted on our site, OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
3223239	3225521	Just look for the little story about the mall tour and click read more.
3225922	3230827	Now, because of the mall tour, people have been getting to play final builds of the game.
3232407	3235068	and came back to report a song list.
3235088	3239030	The song list is also posted on our website, www.orangezonesradio.com.
3239890	3242171	I guess I'll go ahead and read through the song list here.
3242632	3256538	Basically, people have put together, based on the song names, because what somebody did on DDR Freak is they went to the tour and just wrote down all the names, but they neglected to write down all the artists, so they've kind of just been piecing it together, which artists go with which songs.
3257598	3259459	So we know about Akumajou Dracula Medley.
3260139	3265801	This group, Blackalicious, has a song called Alphabet Aerobics, which should be very interesting.
3265901	3268421	I think I actually might have a copy of it on my machine somewhere.
3268441	3270382	I'm going to have to take a look.
3270462	3273863	Bag by Revenge, of course, from DDR Extreme.
3274483	3276744	By the Lucky I Carried with Wen, the Johnny and Spesh mix.
3276764	3277544	We already knew about that one.
3278165	3280245	Or If Is with Basile.
3280445	3283486	No FX with Bath of Least Resistance.
3283926	3285387	That's going to be interesting.
3285407	3285707	No FX.
3286047	3286687	That should be interesting.
3287027	3302774	Moby with Body Rock, B4U with Breakdown, the new Naoki song Brilliant Red, Old School with Butterfly by SmileDK, Candy Star by Love Unlimited, Carnival Day, which is a crossover from Guitar Freaks, Politary and the Foo Foos, Colors, Midi Head Sapphire Mix by DJ Taka.
3303414	3305555	There's two songs called Come With Me.
3305995	3308396	One of them we know is the Rain Dancer version from the V-Rare.
3308416	3309317	We don't know what the other one is.
3310057	3334248	Conflict, the Turmoil Mix by the Azoic, Crazy in Love, which is the Karaoke Revolution crossover that was also in Extreme 2, Daikin Kai, also in Extreme 2, Danza da Yuka by Big Idea, which I believe is on the viewer, I can't remember, Delta 32 is a song by We Don't Know Who, Destiny Lovers, a song from, I think, Extreme, I think, it's been a long time, uh, Extreme
3334528	3352646	Drivin' by Naoki, which was in 2DX, Emotion, there's an old school song for you, Emotion, from the Club of Pens, I believe, Eversnow from Max 2, Firefly by B4U, Frozen Ray, but it says Dirty Hurts, like it's a remix of Frozen Ray by DJ Taka.
3353167	3356230	It was the one that was on the V-Rare.
3356870	3357251	Oh, okay.
3358459	3367531	Hash the Sun by Shatanix, which is also on the VRare, Hateful, we don't know who, here's a list of musical groups, Hey Mama by the Black Eyed Peas.
3368433	3371116	I'm just glad it's not... My humps!
3375031	3376532	I'm glad they didn't pick that song.
3378534	3382798	You know, I was gonna talk about my friend's funny dance to My Humps.
3382818	3383979	You know my friend Billy, right?
3384359	3384599	Yeah.
3384659	3386761	He got really drunk at the party and started dancing to My Humps.
3387141	3388483	My Humps, My Humps.
3390304	3391025	Maybe in Ultramix 4.
3392449	3394751	Hot on the Phone, which we don't know who it's by.
3394831	3397073	It sounds like erotic, but it's not.
3397173	3398174	That's not one of their songs.
3398474	3400036	Sex on the Phone is a song by them, but it's not.
3400936	3402137	I Am Gothic by Spray.
3402178	3404519	Hey, that's the one we announced on Orange Ones Radio weeks ago.
3405881	3409043	Imperfection, the Tycho Brahe remix by Real Life.
3409544	3416229	Real Life did the song Send Me an Angel years and years ago, and they still play it at the goth clubs and stuff, so it should be interesting that they're in there.
3416790	3420673	A song called Insaner by Joni and Spesh.
3421789	3422169	Interesting.
3422589	3425551	They Might Be Giants with Istanbul, Not Constantinople.
3425571	3426091	Cool!
3427552	3428893	Which maybe we'll play.
3428953	3430114	I'm going to see which one of these songs.
3430134	3431555	Maybe they just like it better that way.
3431655	3434716	I have some of these songs, so we're going to try and dig them up and play them.
3435097	3435677	They Might Be Giants.
3435697	3436738	I will play Istanbul, Not Constantinople.
3436758	3446183	What's also great about that too is one of the very first DWI sim files that was ever out there was Istanbul, Not Constantinople, which is great.

3503097	3505239	No, that's from Karaoke Revolution.

3559209	3559709	Yep, it is.
3560730	3561551	It is Ray Charles.

3970978	3972959	What do you guys think of this Ultramix 3 song list?
3972979	3974439	I'm curious to hear your feedback.
3974819	3975299	DarkSakura?
3975700	3976700	Not quite so generic.
3977520	3978941	It's very diverse, isn't it?
3979421	3983222	They're definitely going for a very diverse listing, aren't they?
3983797	3985098	It is very diverse.
3985198	3988019	I like the system that they're so diverse.
3988240	3993823	Like, frickin' Ray Charles and Noah FX in the same mix.
3993843	3994443	That's crazy.
3994663	3995383	That's pretty cute.
3996484	3997124	What do you think, Loki?
3998505	3999506	Um, it's pretty cool.
3999686	4003788	I just don't have an Xbox, so... Well, you have the 360, though, right?
4003808	4006350	Yeah, it doesn't mean it's gonna work on it.
4008087	4010948	Angel, what do you think of the Ultimix 3 songs there?
4035757	4037158	Like you said, pretty diverse.
4038119	4039060	Yeah, I'm looking forward to it.
4039100	4039901	We'll see what happens.
4051106	4060709	Also, one other thing I want to point out about Ultramix 3 is that also what's been revealed in the demo is that they're going to have a .5 speed.
4061189	4063590	So it's like it's going to be able to slow down the arrows.
4063610	4066351	So those of you guys that say, Max 300 is too fast.
4066371	4068251	Well, now you'll have a .5 modifier.
4068631	4069732	So that's going to be very interesting.
4071512	4075013	And also, if you can play bag on .5, that would be very impressive.
4077314	4080455	I know it's been done like on, excuse me,
4082256	4088097	I know that that stuff's been done on StepMania and stuff, but it's nice to see it acknowledged in real DDR.
4092899	4095859	Oh yeah, what arcade mix had the .5 on it?
4095899	4097780	Wasn't there one of the bootlegs or something?
4097940	4106902	Someone hacked Extreme with the .5 speed and the wave and break.
4107779	4109140	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio
4137523	4138004	Hey, what's up?
4138064	4138604	It's Ranma.
4138925	4139846	Hey, Ranma, how are you?
4140166	4141788	Ranma!
4142468	4142749	What?
4142889	4144130	Hey, Jamie, what's up?
4145952	4147955	Yeah, this is the ultimate test of the message, Mark.
4148055	4150337	I'm currently on the road as we speak.
4150597	4151839	You're currently on the road?
4153072	4154834	Yeah, I'm coming back to my niece's house.
4154914	4156176	I'm on the bus heading back home.
4171550	4177492	Well, I'm not too worried about it, because when I did host somebody in the chatroom, it was actually taped in the show, so I'll definitely get a copy.
4177572	4182214	Yeah, I heard about our bootleggers we got going on, so that's cool.
4182474	4183094	It's flattering.
4183334	4183855	Who said hey?
4184155	4187096	I call it syndication underground.
4187516	4187956	Oh, okay.
4188256	4188756	It's all good.
4188896	4189297	It's all good.
4189557	4193458	We can't officially support it because of the licensed music issue, but yeah.
4193658	4194659	We're underground.
4194699	4195499	That's cool.
4197820	4198080	Anyway.
4199120	4200921	First of all, happy Halloween to you guys.
4201300	4201961	Happy Halloween.
4201981	4202982	What are you doing for your Halloween?
4204463	4210548	We're going to hang out tomorrow dressed as Naruto characters and just go enter the parade in downtown Manhattan.
4210969	4211609	Nerds.
4212350	4212870	No, that's cool.
4213051	4213971	Yeah, right we are.
4214532	4216333	I'm wearing big black wings tomorrow.
4216994	4217675	They're feathery.
4219316	4221458	I'm going to go around reaping my fellow co-workers.
4222859	4223100	Uh-oh.
4225339	4228642	and last night we had a Halloween party out in Queensland.
4228702	4234266	Let's just say everybody got trashed and let's just say it boils down to this.
4234726	4238229	Whatever happens at a Halloween party stays at a Halloween party.
4239430	4240071	Oh.
4240351	4242052	You have to be there to understand.
4242212	4243213	Let's see about some of that.
4243273	4244674	Well, good watching.
4245115	4245955	One of those things.
4246075	4251580	Well, we've got to kind of keep it short tonight because we've got a ton of people trying to get in, but anything else you want to say?
4251600	4251900	We've got to.
4253252	4276094	and the message line works great, especially when you're out on the road alright, sounds good alright, you guys take care alright, take care bud, later and when he talks about our new message line of course he's talking about the phone number that you can call in as well, 916-226-9067 if you want to get through or you can also give us a call on the old Skype line let's go to another call I'm going to pick up this one hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio
4279599	4281140	Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.
4282580	4282820	Cool.
4283721	4285121	Um, what's up?
4285841	4286202	Right now?
4286962	4287702	Yeah, hi.
4287822	4288242	Who is this?
4289083	4289443	Who is this?
4289963	4291263	It's Nintendomaniac64.
4291363	4293324	Hi, Nintendomaniac64, why are you pissed?
4297150	4301010	I don't know what to say.
4301050	4302631	We've never been in this situation before.
4303011	4304951	One other time we were in this situation.
4305271	4308052	We've been on the air for three and a half years now.
4308132	4309212	Literally three and a half years.
4309652	4312873	And we've only one other time been this popular.
4312913	4316174	And the only reason we had so many people trying to get in that episode...
4316374	4316874	People get pissed.
4316954	4317495	People get pissed.
4345939	4347040	Yeah, I'm sorry.
4347340	4351623	We're going to look at what we can do about increasing the cap so we can get more listeners in during the show.
4351683	4355446	But for tonight, you guys are a little bit screwed.
4355766	4356567	But you know what?
4356627	4358989	Go into our chat room at orangelaunchradio.com and click on chat.
4359109	4366674	And there's people that can help you catch up on what you missed, so to speak, if you know what I mean.
4366714	4366955	Yeah.
4367055	4367935	Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.
4369697	4369897	Yeah.
4370277	4371378	All right.
4371418	4374100	Anything you want to say gaming related or related to the show?
4375478	4377459	Yeah, uh, you said you got Midway Arcade Treasures 3?
4377499	4380620	Uh, run that by me one more time, you broke up a little bit there?
4382441	4384602	You said you got Midway Arcade Treasures 3?
4385063	4386403	Yes, I got Midway Arcade Treasures 3.
4388444	4391686	Cool, I've been trying, like, forever to get that game.
4392346	4399670	Really, it's not, I, I got it thanks to Loki, so I didn't try to go out and buy it in the store or anything, so, I guess I got kinda lucky.
4400010	4402631	Well, not like, not trying forever, but I mean, like,
4404026	4404927	I can't drive yet.
4424962	4431086	Midway Arcade Treasures 3, of course, is the eight driving games kind of all put in one game.
4432527	4440413	Classics like Hydro Thunder and Stun Runner and my favorite, Iron Man Off-Road with the track pack as well, which I think is awesome.
4440793	4442274	So anyway, let's go to another call.
4442334	4444536	Let's go to this one.
4445076	4445977	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
4448879	4450440	Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
4451841	4452501	Hello.
4452802	4453062	Hello.
4454178	4454398	Hi.
4454418	4455519	Hi, who's this?
4456560	4457420	This is Roz again.
4457540	4458221	Hi, Roz.
4458241	4458721	How are you?
4458821	4459342	Hi, Roz.
4460402	4460923	Hi.
4462064	4462384	What's up?
4462404	4462964	I'm pretty good.
4463104	4469029	Actually, I feel really damn great because I had my first ever Red Bull today.
4470230	4470550	What?
4471130	4472391	She had her first Red Bull today.
4472731	4473572	Oh, shit.
4474891	4475832	Red Bull is the color of pee.
4492543	4492843	It is.
4492983	4494845	It really looks a lot like it.
4495445	4500428	That's why it's in a can, not a clear bottle.
4500668	4502369	So why are you drinking Red Bull tonight?
4502390	4504631	Are you just drinking it for recreational purposes?
4506352	4513697	Well, I had never had one before, and I was going to get bottled water, but they were out of it for some reason, like at the little store place I was at.
4514614	4518436	So the other thing that they had that was like cold was Red Bull.
4518816	4522298	So I just picked one out and decided to drink it today.
4523318	4524199	I feel great.
4525960	4527981	You kind of sound like you're really happy.
4530242	4530902	I'm just messing with you.
4530922	4532063	That's great.
4532883	4535284	Red Bull gives you wings because it makes you freaking high.
4538346	4539026	Yeah, exactly.
4539487	4539807	Awesome.
4541400	4544203	So anything you want to share about what you've been hearing on the show so far?
4544264	4545866	Anything going on in your video game world?
4552848	4554188	Oh yeah, the Katamari cake.
4554308	4558850	Dude, what is up with all these cakes you guys are looking at tonight in chat?
4559070	4566451	So there was the cake with the giant penis on it, and now there's the cake that's a Katamari, the little prince of the cosmos pushing around the Katamari.
4566471	4566871	That's awesome.
4566891	4568312	I want a cake like that for my birthday.
4569172	4571313	Yeah, like two years ago I had a Kirby cake.
4573393	4574673	Oh, that's so cute.
4574813	4576194	What was Kirby doing on the Kirby cake?
4577194	4579115	He was just kind of being there.
4579415	4580955	Just chilling out, saying, hey, I'm a cake.
4581693	4582254	In the fridge.
4582614	4586577	And I couldn't look in the fridge for like two days because it was supposed to be a surprise.
4586858	4587198	Okay.
4588880	4597007	Yeah, so I would be like making eggs and I'd have to shut my eyes and I'd end up like sticking my hand in mashed potatoes or something.
4597047	4598628	What flavor was Kirby when you ate him?
4599949	4600390	Strawberry.
4601050	4601371	Awesome.
4601991	4603012	That's a very Kirby flavor.
4603212	4604453	Kirby is strawberry.
4605274	4605715	Delicious.
4606516	4612221	Well, Roz, we're going to go ahead and let you go so we can get to another caller, but thanks so much for calling in and sharing the Kirby cake love with us.
4612521	4616064	And enjoy that Red Bull, but please, don't drink and drive, alright?
4617125	4617465	Okay.
4617565	4618466	Alright, have a good one.
4619407	4619707	Bye.
4619767	4621368	Oh, I also want to say, Roz, Roz, wait.
4621388	4623090	I actually talked while the girl was here.
4623931	4625812	Roz, I just want to say real quick, one more thing.
4627133	4628955	Do you drink liquor at all, ever?
4631324	4636688	I don't want to be responsible for starting someone's drinking career, so stay away from the absolute for tonight.
4660879	4666509	Let's go to another call Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio Hey Hey, who's this?
4667351	4671758	This is Xander from Florida again Hi, Xander from Florida Aren't you one of our listeners who's shut out right now?
4673240	4673480	Yes.
4673880	4676321	Oh, I'm so sorry to hear it, but I don't know what to tell you.
4676361	4677361	This is crazy.
4677461	4679161	I've never seen this happen on Orange Lounge.
4680382	4684023	Did somebody hear that we were giving away a million dollars or something?
4684263	4684863	I don't know why.
4684883	4686243	They knew that I was back.
4686683	4690744	That's what I've been telling people again to listen, so I don't know.
4690784	4691485	Maybe that's the problem.
4691705	4693305	No, we're going to do something about it.
4693345	4696546	We're just going to have to pony up the extra money to double our cap, but...
4697765	4700707	That will involve probably all of us having to get a second job.
4700847	4701948	No, I'm kidding.
4702728	4703689	We're going to do something about it.
4703709	4705790	We just can't do it tonight, so to speak.
4705830	4707211	So you guys are kind of locked out tonight.
4707271	4710493	So we're just surprised because we have not been in danger of hitting our cap.
4710993	4716697	But little known fact, or maybe not so little, but our podcast was actually featured on Yahoo this week.
4717117	4723641	So I think because of that, if you go to podcast.yahoo.com, you see a little picture of our podcast.
4723921	4724642	So I think...
4725362	4730525	That in turn created more podcast downloads, which in turn have created more show listeners.
4731605	4737048	We're very happy that folks are tuning in to listen to the madness, but it's kind of crazy at the same time.
4739093	4742015	Well, Xander, since you're not able to listen to the show, is there anything you want to tell our listeners?
4745036	4747318	No, I can't think of anything right now.
4747638	4748778	All right.
4748798	4750199	I know I had something before.
4750700	4752420	I always lose it whenever I call you guys.
4752541	4755322	It's the pressures of being on air that make you forget things, huh?
4755422	4756283	Right.
4756303	4761345	So if you ever wonder why we don't ever talk about video games on the live show, it's the pressures of being on air.
4761806	4763006	We completely forget about games.
4763627	4763807	We do.
4765455	4766596	All right, Xander, well, thanks for the call.
4766636	4767356	Have a good one, okay?
4767416	4768056	And I hope you get in.
4768316	4768657	Thank you.
4768977	4769657	All right, keep trying.
4770197	4770418	Later.
4772399	4773599	All right, thank you, Xander, for calling.
4773819	4777881	Okay, we're actually going to shut off the Skyplane just for a little bit and go to an actual break.
4777901	4785605	We are going to come back, so if you haven't gotten through just yet, don't cry and scream just yet, because we are going to take some more calls a little later in the show, I promise.
4786166	4788487	But I really have to pee, so that means we take a break.
4789147	4789527	I'm sorry.
4789747	4790788	That's just how it is, guys.
4790828	4792709	When I've got to go potty, we go to a break.
4794980	4798402	So we're going to go to break and we're going to come back with more Orange Lounge Radio.
4799123	4800224	And I think we'll start off this break.
4800244	4801385	We'll do some DDR music.
4802185	4804107	Oh, you want to do Rock Lobster?
4804147	4805147	I don't have Rock Lobster.
4805227	4807069	I have Rome and I have Love Shack.
4807089	4807909	I don't have Rock Lobster.
4807929	4809350	How can you not have Rock Lobster?
4809390	4809831	I know.
4809991	4811952	Well, I'll get it for later.
4812753	4814554	All right, we're going to do some DDR music in this break.
4816656	4820919	Oh, yes, Dark Sakura wanted to hear some You're Not Here, which was a song in DDR.
4820939	4824021	That's one of the songs that I built out in my car when no one's in there with me.
4825206	4827068	I want to hear your lovely singing voice sometime.
4828169	4829310	You won't because I don't have one.
4832113	4832613	Fine.
4832813	4838659	We'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio and your calls.
4840000	4840841	Okay, we'll get the Mflow.
4840941	4844264	We don't have Mirrorball Satellite.
4845345	4847587	We'll play Mflow from Third Style and they'll like it.
4849755	4850637	We'll be back after this.
4883148	4886936	We risk our dreams forever, the raindrops blowin' the wind, it's deadly
4893254	4894495	Thank you for watching!
4916040	4936307	I'm strung out, addicted to you, my body aches, now that you're gone My supplies fell through, you let me give me everything you had and more You craved my happiness, when you made me feel joy in me, just smile for now
4941857	4942858	Thank you for watching!
4991308	4992129	Thanks for watching!
5019799	5020660	Thanks for watching!
5057638	5059340	Turn around, look at what you see
5152371	5157158	Love or truth, this is what I prove, between me and you.
5157198	5160022	Love or truth, whichever you choose, is for me.
5240232	5240693	I got a beat.
5267780	5270742	Alright, so typically this is the part of the show where we'd come back on air.
5270782	5275445	However, due to popular demand from our chatroom, we are going to do one more song.
5275565	5278466	And it's a brand new song from DDR Ultramix 3.
5279307	5281728	We're going to play this full song because it just rocks that much.
5282248	5282569	Enjoy.
5282589	5286391	It has a quiet opening, but trust me, the song's playing.
5292975	5293295	Ultramix 3
5301524	5302250	Thanks for watching!
5315842	5336284	Istanbul was Constantinople, now it's Istanbul, now Constantinople Been a long time gone, Constantinople, now it's Thursday night, on a moonlit night Every gal in Constantinople lives in Istanbul, now Constantinople So if you like dating Constantinople, she'll be waiting in Istanbul Even old New York was once New Amsterdam
5336804	5337784	Why'd they change it?
5337884	5338585	I can't say.
5338885	5340745	People just liked it better that way.
5340946	5342826	So, take me back to Constantinople.
5342866	5344987	No, you can't go back to Constantinople.
5345007	5346187	Been a long time gone.
5346207	5348688	Constantinople, why did Constantinople get the works?
5349208	5352610	That's nobody's business but the Turks.
5352690	5353010	Istanbul.
5353070	5353390	Istanbul.
5353470	5353770	Istanbul.
5369091	5377839	Even Old New York was once New Amsterdam Why they changed it, I can't say You just liked it better that way!
5377859	5385546	Istanbul was Constantinople, now it's Istanbul The Constantinople, they're a long time gone The Constantinople, why did Constantinople get the works?
5386046	5388869	That's nobody's business but the Turks
5397893	5405756	So take me back to Constantinople No you can't go back to Constantinople Been a long time gone, Constantinople Out of Constantinople, get the works That's nobody's business but the Turks
5433612	5439536	We're back here on Orange Lounge Radio, that was a little bit of Istanbul, not Constantinople, but they might be giants.
5440436	5446020	That mp3 file was a little quiet, sorry guys, I had to turn that up in the middle there, and sorry for the volume.
5447161	5451143	Anyway, we're back here on Orange Lounge Radio, and we've been talking about Ultramix 3 a little bit.
5451183	5458168	We were taking some calls over Skype, and I do want to take some more calls over Skype very shortly, and get to the cage match as well, we got that to worry about.
5458188	5459609	Loki, what's up, what's on your mind?
5460228	5460528	Nothing.
5460588	5464970	I figure I'll save it for after the KH match in my normal segment, which I cover the sim news.
5465870	5467191	Is there actually going to be sim news tonight?
5467251	5468051	Of course!
5469672	5472373	Did you know that DDR Mania X actually came back?
5472533	5472913	Did they?
5473413	5474154	I didn't know that.
5474314	5475895	Apparently they've been up for a while now.
5475915	5477775	Can I have a confession to make?
5478516	5479316	No, no, no.
5479376	5481277	I don't want to offend anybody when I say this.
5482202	5485383	I don't really visit any Bomani sites besides DDR Freakin' Orange Lounge.
5485723	5486323	I really don't.
5486943	5497005	Well, Bomani style, once in a great while, I kind of lurk just to kind of see what the goings-ons are, and I think I've done the same on Air in Japan, but on a regular basis, I only visit DDR Freakin' Orange Lounge.
5497425	5498585	I don't really surf the other sites.
5499426	5502366	And it's not that they're bad sites, it's just I don't have time.
5502766	5503286	Yes, it is.
5503406	5505067	We will have... No, it's not.
5505307	5510228	We will have, hopefully, if everything works out, and I will go into this later...
5512433	5515018	We will have more stuff in our download section for our PSP site.
5515418	5517502	Stuff that's related to the show.
5518363	5519926	That'd be awesome.
5521548	5524593	Because this hasn't been posted anywhere except for Japanese sites.
5526960	5527020	D.R.
5527080	5527180	ANGEL
5548454	5551676	Your Mama Joke of the Week Today's haiku is a summarization of Gulliver's Fowls by Jonathan Swift.
5551696	5554278	The size was first great, then small, and much vexed to learn, but the size does matter.
5554298	5554638	Interesting.
5554658	5554879	Interesting.
5578391	5582293	You know, if you ever run out of advice columns, you should just have the haiku of the week on the podcast.
5583613	5584294	The Kama Sutra.
5585354	5587535	Advice for those in a difficult position.
5587715	5589156	First, be flexible.
5594818	5600880	Speaking of the Kama Sutra, let's talk about the Burning Crusade, things you don't want after practicing the Kama Sutra.
5601180	5602421	You don't want a Burning Crusade.
5603439	5606000	Angel, you're one of our resident World of Warcraft whores.
5606240	5607701	Who's got the highest level?
5607741	5608341	What's your highest level?
5608361	5608561	Me.
5608901	5609502	DarkSakura?
5609522	5610182	Seven.
5610382	5611683	And Loki, you don't play that bullshit.
5611783	5614564	My highest level is 16, so what's yours?
5614624	5616245	Currently, mine's 43.
5616885	5618646	All right, you're the official WoW whore.
5618666	5620927	So what's going on in the World of WoW?
5622187	5625168	First off, your hair looks good, though, DarkSakura.
5625308	5625669	It looks good.
5625829	5626529	It looks pink.
5627089	5627569	It looks good.
5627609	5628410	I like the color.
5628670	5629890	All right, anyway, so...
5631687	5641594	BlizzCon was this past weekend, and I would have gone had I had more interest a couple months ago in what Blizzard was doing, but I kind of ignored World of Warcraft for a long, long time.
5642355	5642815	You all know.
5643295	5646297	And I never really got into Warcraft 3 or Warcraft 2.
5647098	5650500	I played a lot of Warcraft 2, actually, but I was really fucking bad at it.
5650560	5654023	When I say really fucking bad, I mean really fucking bad at Warcraft.
5654103	5656565	I did not have the brain capacity to handle so many things going on at once.
5657406	5659147	Yeah, World of Warcraft is not a problem for me.
5659408	5660028	Oh, man.
5660889	5662010	I can't even explain it.
5662230	5671157	I mean, I know there's a lot out there, you know, City of Heroes and now soon City of Villains and Final Fantasy XI and just, you know, there's a lot out there.
5671177	5673119	EQ too, yeah.
5674220	5680425	But World of Warcraft for me, wow, it's just, no pun intended.
5680565	5681446	Yeah, all right.
5681826	5682186	That's cool.
5682447	5682847	So what's up?
5682887	5684128	What's going to happen with this new expansion?
5684368	5685369	Oh, so much.
5686790	5693716	We're going to have what's called rideable mounts, which currently they have mounts for each race.
5694837	5709089	When you hit 40, you can save up all your money and go train on riding and then go get your mount so that you can be all cool and ride all fast around the lands rather than walking because, well, we all know walking sucks.
5709149	5710010	Yeah, walking sucks.
5710350	5712231	and flying those birds takes forever sometimes.
5712271	5716453	Yes, flying those birds can take forever and they can be expensive depending on where you need to go.
5716613	5718653	So, that's cool.
5718693	5722195	They're going to have flyable mounts now in the new expansion.
5723015	5727897	There's also going to be a lot of areas you need to explore and stuff like that.
5729458	5737261	They're raising the level cap from 60 to 70 which will enable us to go beyond the Dark Portal.
5738402	5739262	If you guys remember
5741344	5746270	Warcraft 2 expansion, Beyond the Dark Portal, and then Warcraft 3.
5746910	5756842	So we're going to be able to go through the portal, and I believe one of the things that you can do when you go Beyond the Dark Portal...
5757882	5759822	New Race for the Horde is Blood Elves
5786915	5797539	Um, I do not know what the Alliance is going to get, but, ah, well, it's rumored it's going to be Pandarian, so, or Pandaren, no, Pandaren, that's it.
5798359	5806102	But, yeah, so, um, yeah, I don't know, am I forgetting something, Mr. Robb?
5807444	5812007	I think you hit on most of the big points about what's going on with the expansion.
5813027	5816069	The rumored Pandarian would be so cool if that really happens.
5817370	5818831	I think you hit on most of the other big stuff.
5819411	5824214	There's going to be a new profession, like alchemy and stuff, to go along with the socketed items.
5824234	5826655	You could be a jewel master.
5828336	5829997	Yeah, I can't really think of anything else.
5830297	5834960	I probably did forget something or whatever along the way, but
5835441	5835741	DarkSakura.com
5853676	5856937	heavily, heavily into World of Warcraft, and that's all they do on the station.
5856957	5857897	You can plug them, I don't care.
5858357	5859757	Oh, wcradio.com.
5859897	5860257	Okay.
5861037	5861638	Well, you know that.
5861658	5863538	I'm all about supporting the independent radio.
5863658	5869059	I just don't want you coming on here and plugging, you know, 97.1 to hit, say FM, you know, fuck them.
5869599	5872320	No, my number one will always be Orange Hill Radio.
5872360	5872940	Oh, you're sweet.
5873060	5873300	All right.
5874320	5877861	Yeah, so, I don't know, I think I pretty much hit everything.
5878521	5879301	New instances in...
5879972	5880713	All that stuff, too.
5880833	5882754	So, hey, there's a lot to look forward to.
5882854	5883375	Good times.
5883775	5884416	Looking forward to it.
5884876	5885256	All right.
5885637	5888379	We're going to go back over to the Skype line and take some of your calls.
5888419	5896866	So if you do want to call into the show, you can do that by going over to our Skype line at www.OrangeLoungeRadio.com and clicking on Interact With Us for more information.
5897246	5903131	Or you can always call us the old-fashioned way, and that is via the telephone, 916-226-9067.
5903491	5904492	Let's go to our first call.
5904532	5905653	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
5906908	5908292	Hi, Sephiroth1215.
5908572	5910358	Hey, Sephiroth1215, what's on your mind?
5912423	5913928	Actually, a lot of stuff today.
5914963	5925727	First of all, to start off, I'll say the Ultramix 3 list so far sounds pretty interesting, and it just sounds like they give Konami of Hawaii a big budget now.
5926627	5935070	It is kind of weird, like, all these songs from so many random different places, but I don't know, I strangely dig it.
5935090	5936771	There really is something for everyone.
5936871	5939392	I mean, I know they've said that about previous DDR mixes,
5940212	5954184	Hey, there's something for everyone, but no, seriously guys, this time, something for everyone, like even like Ray Charles, no FX, come on, that's tapping into audiences that never would have looked twice at DDR before, so that's something else.
5956098	5962444	Yeah, but otherwise, something you haven't really talked about is the recent release of DDR Mario Mix here.
5964086	5970672	I kind of glossed over DDR Mario Mix because I haven't picked up my copy yet, because I bought Soul Calibur III instead this week.
5972794	5975176	which should show you where I'm at DDR-wise.
5975276	5980521	Plus, you know, I just, it doesn't seem like something that's that difficult, but I don't know.
5980541	5980961	What do you think?
5981001	5981582	Did you pick it up?
5983463	5986726	Technically, I did, but I got it for free.
5987186	5987787	Okay, okay.
5987947	5989708	Oh, did you, like, win one of those tournaments or something?
5991010	5994112	Yeah, only three people showed up, and two of which were my friends.
5994613	5995193	Good job.
5995273	5995954	Good job, anyway.
5997358	6002223	Yeah, so I just got it for free, and I unlocked pretty much everything just last night.
6002743	6003724	Was there anything really cool?
6005025	6009029	Or was it all Mario stuff and classical tunes being redone?
6009810	6011231	Yeah, it's okay.
6011331	6012412	The song's okay.
6013233	6020399	What I think is interesting is the way they did it, of how it's just like a Mario game where you go through different worlds and go through the levels in the worlds.
6021260	6021620	Really?
6021640	6021861	Yeah.
6024878	6029863	But otherwise, I think it's really good that I got it for free.
6030163	6033286	Because I wouldn't really pay for it unless it was maybe cheaper.
6034827	6036649	Yeah, it's a little too much money for me right now, too.
6036669	6038811	Don't they want like 60 bucks for it with the pad and everything?
6039631	6042953	Yeah, but I actually think that soft pad is really nice.
6043313	6045495	It has more padding in the middle.
6046736	6059684	The pads have been getting progressively nicer through various CDR mixes, because we had the original one, which is okay, and there was actually the old, old Konami mat for the Dreamcast that had that funny layer of plastic over the mat.
6060104	6061285	DarkSakura, you had these mats.
6061305	6062906	They were like some of the first mats I ever played on.
6063206	6068268	I had the Dreamcast ones that were the triple sticky thing, and now they slide apart.
6070069	6071850	They're not as good as one thinks they are.
6072670	6075611	And then the Xbox ones were really good, and now the GameCube ones.
6075631	6077112	So they've had a lot of time to get it right.
6079573	6083834	So far I think those are the best softpads, but I have a metal pad anyway, so whatever.
6085055	6087636	Do you think there's enough here for DDR fans to be happy?
6089537	6089657	Um...
6092096	6095358	Mario Mix is one of those games that's going to be more for kids.
6121618	6125301	People that just are obsessed with Nintendo, like Ultimate Nintendo Fanboys and stuff.
6126361	6132386	Or, you know, people that like the GameCube, or only have a GameCube, or like the GameCube things.
6132706	6135628	I think most of the hardcore DDR people are going to find their game somewhere else.
6136589	6140171	It's definitely a good mix to start out with for somebody who hasn't played yet, though.
6140332	6140852	Oh, that's cool.
6141092	6141793	It's definitely good.
6142113	6142753	They need that, too.
6144174	6148938	Alright, well, Sephiroth1215, I'll let you have your final words, then we're going to let you go and try to get another call.
6150374	6163720	All right, last thing I wanted to say, which I can't confirm or anything, I just heard around, is that the Xbox 360 is, you can't get the premiums in first-come, first-served stores.
6164000	6169143	I hope that's a lot of bullshit, because if it is not bullshit and that leads out to be true, I'm going to be one pissed motherfucker.
6169503	6171024	I'm going to be one pissed motherfucker.
6171064	6175926	I should not have to reserve that crap without them telling me.
6177959	6179264	I can't be sure of that though.
6179304	6180228	Where did you hear it though?
6180268	6182356	Did you hear it at a store that does reservations?
6183690	6188433	Um, yeah, first, I heard it online in GameFAQs, which I'm like, whatever, I don't really believe you.
6188513	6197979	Then I went to a store, and they said, yeah, we're not allowed to take any cores, because they're sending all the cores out to the stores, and we're getting all the premiums to try and get all the pre-orders up.
6198900	6201261	I have this weird feeling, I hope it's not true, or I'm gonna be pissed.
6201561	6206244	I cannot imagine a huge chain like Best Buy, that they would screw over somebody like Best Buy or Toys R Us with that.
6206825	6206965	Um...
6208215	6211798	I don't know, maybe we'll call Microsoft on the podcast or something.
6212038	6216061	If it wasn't so late on a Sunday night they were open, I swear we'd call somebody and try to figure it out.
6216762	6219764	I have a feeling it's false, but we'll see.
6219824	6221645	If it does turn out to be true, I'm going to be pissed.
6223547	6228110	Yeah, you can still reserve it, but I don't think you're guaranteed it until next year sometime.
6229311	6229831	What a crap.
6230112	6230692	What a bunch of crap.
6231333	6233054	I will get one launch day, just you wait.
6235075	6236256	Hey, Zaku, what's on your mind?
6261284	6266167	I'm posting up a link right now that pretty much might be of your interest.
6266647	6271510	Some of you might hate it, some of you might say, what the fuck am I doing, but here we go.
6272470	6277473	It's from CDR Freaks New York forums, but I think you'll see what I'm trying to tell you.
6277733	6280675	Okay, so give us a description of it while it loads on the computers here.
6282116	6286018	Alright, basically, MTV wants New York City DDR players.
6286690	6293896	Don't know why, but this dude who was probably recruited by them is seeking our kind.
6295317	6298500	Okay, so if you live in the New York area, let's see.
6300922	6305185	As you can see in the thread, I've already signed up as well as several other prominent players.
6305225	6305725	They basically...
6330410	6337433	They already called me back that same day, and MTV is supposed to be calling me soon about the interview date.
6338173	6338473	Awesome.
6338493	6340154	We'll drop our name a whole bunch, all right?
6342215	6342715	We'll see.
6342895	6343715	I'm just messing with you.
6343755	6344395	Have fun with it.
6344435	6344936	Have fun with it.
6344956	6345556	That's great news.
6347056	6351838	Yeah, that's basically what they want.
6351878	6358941	They want sociable and outgoing people to just break that stereotype, which is basically what we are in a nutshell.
6359952	6361053	Okay, well, yeah.
6362613	6368076	And as far as Ultramix 3 songs go, freestylers are fine.
6368996	6369977	That's all you need to know.
6370037	6384164	If we were able, you know, a couple of weeks ago to hook up a PS2 to a DDR machine and use it as such, we could probably do the same thing for an Xbox and whore out the songs for freestyle routines.
6384244	6386025	Oh yeah, it's going to be great for freestyle people.
6386305	6388386	So it's got such a solid song list.
6389413	6394217	If we could get it, that's if we could, you know, hook up an Xbox to a DDR machine in about a year.
6394477	6395098	You never know.
6395759	6396239	You never know.
6398100	6398341	Mm-hmm.
6398441	6399181	Okay, okay.
6399261	6400642	Well, good luck with the MTV thing.
6400662	6403645	And, you know, I don't really watch MTV, but I'll make an exception.
6403705	6406567	If you get on it, I'll TiVo it or something.
6407768	6409450	Yeah, I just hope I get in.
6410130	6410851	All right.
6411531	6415915	Yeah, it's probably in a few weeks anyway, so... As I said...
6416556	6418477	Watch out, I might be on TV.
6418777	6419197	Alright.
6419417	6423378	If I am, just, you know, you'll probably mention it on Sunday.
6424498	6425419	Maybe, we might.
6425559	6426279	No, I'm kidding, we would.
6426459	6426739	We would.
6427759	6430680	Well, good luck with that, and, you know, again, name drop a lot.
6430880	6431860	Orange Lounge, love it.
6431981	6432481	No, I'm just kidding.
6433101	6434041	Have a good one, alright?
6435542	6436942	I gotta let you go so we can get more calls.
6438260	6441602	Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match
6469551	6470251	www.orangeloungeradio.com
6492338	6496102	Song number one tonight is going for its fourth week win.
6496603	6499866	If it wins tonight, it will be retired.
6499906	6506473	It will be only the, I think, fifth song to be retired out of Orange Lounge Radio's cage match in the couple years we've been doing this.
6507114	6507354	So...
6508155	6509535	Here it is, it's song number four.
6509555	6511376	And it wasn't even really picked by one of us.
6511436	6514797	I mean, I put it in, but I put it in on behalf of Miklatov.
6515237	6517457	So, just kind of interesting the way that works out.
6517477	6521678	So this would be the first song that would get retired that was not even put in by one of us.
6522058	6523759	So it would be very interesting to see what happens.
6524079	6529080	So here it is, it's song number one, going for its fourth win in a row.
6529120	6530060	Will it be retired?
6530580	6531161	It's up to you.
6531301	6532721	Pendulum withholds your color.
6665232	6667654	All right, let's get into song number two tonight.
6667694	6669915	Song number two is Dark Sakura's pick.
6669935	6672096	Dark Sakura, what did you pick for us?
6672157	6672337	It's...
6693030	6693870	It's OG Bitch!
6729232	6730533	Thank you for watching!
6911289	6919520	Alright, uttering her first words on the new microphone, DarkSakura will let us know how she liked OG Bitch.
6919980	6920281	Nine.
6921062	6922844	Get some nine from DarkSakura.
6923845	6924786	Yeah, I think it went through.
6925107	6926529	DarkSakura, give us a sentence.
6927765	6928506	I like burritos.
6928766	6929286	Okay, that works.
6929306	6929667	There we go.
6929987	6930347	Alright.
6931008	6931408	Loki.
6932109	6933970	I don't like burritos or that song.
6934871	6935711	It's a five.
6936172	6938614	It's like OG bitch.
6939855	6940215	I don't know.
6940275	6943358	Is that like... It seems very Latin to me.
6943378	6945399	That would be original gangsta bitch, actually.
6946881	6947361	I don't know.
6947501	6949322	I didn't get it.
6949462	6951504	I kind of dug it because it had a cool beat to it.
6951544	6952505	Like, I liked the remix.
6952905	6959810	I'm not so sure I was up on the singing because the singing kind of had this kind of weird thing to it, but it was cool.
6960051	6962833	I mean, it was kind of... It's a song I could see myself getting down at the club.
6963633	6964374	OG clubbing.
6965054	6965955	So I give it an 8.
6966055	6966936	It was pretty good.
6968077	6969038	Extifer, what did you think?
6970579	6972100	She didn't sound like a gangsta.
6973061	6973261	But...
6974056	6977179	I will give it a five because I don't know what to think.
6977239	6978640	I'm purely in the middle on that one.
6978940	6979360	Alright.
6979761	6980141	Angel?
6981422	6982943	I liked the beat to it.
6982983	6983744	It was pretty neat.
6983944	6984605	Um, six.
6985605	6985886	Alright.
6987066	6993031	Song number three tonight, going up against Estro and Pendulum is... Loki, what'd you put in?
6993972	6998035	You know, this is just one of those weeks where I had nothing really to put in.
6998776	7002679	So, this song will go out to Captain Jack being dead and all, but, um,
7003032	7012584	This is actually, I think out of all the songs I've listened to him, this best sums up, you know, kind of the mood with him being, you know, dead and everything.
7012724	7014906	But, um, it's also really strange.
7015447	7016468	It's a really strange song.
7016488	7020213	I'm saying all those go to Pendulum because that's a fucking awesome song, but...
7020999	7021399	Here you go.
7021800	7022480	I don't know.
7022500	7024182	You're going for the sympathy vote tonight.
7024322	7026103	I'm not even hoping to get any votes.
7026183	7030587	But, you know, because the song I wanted to put in was too long and I didn't want to cut it down.
7030807	7032048	Anyway.
7032248	7032609	Let's see.
7033069	7034030	Song number three.
7034610	7035511	Going out to the man.
7035811	7036452	Captain Jack.
7036532	7038413	It's Captain Jack with Back Home.
7038673	7038994	Enjoy.
7066698	7079504	The captain wants to be back home And the captain fights against the storm He's always tuned against
7080151	7083817	He always wants to live and be back home
7088288	7108183	It was a lonely night with a pack full of dreams Miles away from home, I felt cold in the sea As if I was the only human being on Earth I thought about the soldiers and the peace camp there Couldn't stop thinking about my company About coming home, life and history How everything started with Captain Jack When will I meet you?
7108263	7109504	When will I be back?
7109924	7114688	Strike, try hard, give the best you can So never stop fighting for the peace in your land
7115308	7133423	Come together and see the light All for one, like a stick of dynamite The captain wants to be back home And the captain fights against the storm He's always true to the game He always wants to live and be back home
7142029	7147274	After hours and hours of marching through the land, there was something in the air held a flower in my hand.
7147554	7149976	The grass was green and the moon shined bright.
7150276	7152498	Remember that night when she held me tight.
7152819	7158223	I went down to the river with the water, but look, I was longing for my band and for the crazy couple.
7158323	7163528	When morning came and I reached the camp, I took a break and lay down in the warm white sand.
7163708	7165870	So try, try hard and give the best you can.
7166531	7183491	Never stop fighting for the peace in our land Come together and see the light All for one like a stick of dynamite The captain wants to be back home And the captain fights against the storm
7196038	7209153	The captain wants to be back home And the captain is feeling all alone He's always true to himself He always wants to live and be back home
7217683	7242276	Tak tak tak, never looking back Come and fight for Captain Jack Say it slow, but say it loud Join the peace camp and you'll be proud Jump and walk, train and talk Move your body, you're not a piece of chalk Scream and shout, call out my name It's Captain Jack, straight back again The captain wants to be back home
7244393	7268908	And the captain fights against the storm He's always true to game He always wants to live and be back home The captain wants to be back home And the captain is feeling all alone
7275430	7296077	The captain wants to live and be back home The captain wants to be back home And the captain fights against the storm He's always true to himself He always wants to live and be back home
7303763	7314234	The captain wants to be back home And the captain is feeling all alone He's always true to himself
7361468	7369774	DarkSakura, what did you think of that tribute that Loki picked there for Captain Jack?
7369934	7372596	I'm presently bleeding out of my ears from brain hemorrhage.
7373096	7374898	Careful, I think that's what Captain Jack died of.
7375938	7376379	I know.
7376999	7377960	This one gets a two.
7377980	7380262	A two from DarkSakura.
7380502	7380882	Loki!
7382904	7385205	You know, I don't know, it just...
7386411	7387211	It was a weird song.
7387531	7393893	I think the song was okay until he started doing his rapping or whatever that is.
7395694	7399735	It gets like a 7 for the amount of days he's been dead.
7401095	7405496	Actually, I have to say his rapping reminded me of New Edition and Roni.
7406516	7408057	With Bobby Brown trying to rap.
7408857	7409777	Kind of, kind of.
7410197	7412138	I don't know, like I said, throw away songs to wear.
7414058	7417239	You know what song kind of reminded me of something else?
7424783	7425403	I like that song.
7425423	7426463	And that song sucked too.
7426943	7429004	I like it.
7429364	7432866	Sorry, you know what, Captain Jack was the man, but he needs to stick to barking orders.
7433426	7434827	Because that's when I want to pay attention.
7435127	7435507	I don't like...
7436631	7460167	I don't like that, I don't like that pussy Captain Jack in that song, I don't like that, I'm sorry, Captain Jack needs to go, and yes sir, yes sir, yes sir, I will party down right now, there is a song that's actually on the same CD that is called, I don't remember what it's called now, Sir Yes Sir, it's something like that, and it's about like Captain Jack,
7460595	7465017	That's the kind of song that I'd like to listen at the stroke of 11.30 when I'm about to go to sleep at night.
7465117	7465577	And then suddenly...
7487605	7494648	Suddenly I'll wake up in the hospital surrounded by my hot bitches as I'm slipping into my coma.
7496868	7498169	I'm sorry, wait, hold on.
7498209	7499389	I need to check with the judges.
7500290	7504051	Judges, are we allowed to be insensitive after only a week?
7504651	7505251	I don't know.
7505331	7506932	Is that politically correct?
7506952	7507412	Yes!
7507832	7513414	I was never really sensitive to begin with, so I'm kind of... Please try not to piss off the listeners.
7513834	7515075	Hi listeners, I love you.
7516553	7525059	I will give it an 8, because I think that this song should win over the Pendulum song.
7525159	7526580	Don't forget about the OG bitch!
7527721	7528582	No, I don't know.
7528642	7529983	She didn't sound like a gangsta.
7530683	7535467	The Captain Jack is an OG bitch.
7535827	7539330	I'm all for the true Compton gangstas.
7539650	7543913	I like Compton gangstas, not Mexican Latina gangstas.
7545352	7546654	Angel, what did you think?
7548536	7553863	It kind of reminded me of the 80s, not so much love songs, but R&B love songs.
7553903	7554604	The crappy songs, Angel.
7555305	7556226	Yeah, that'll work.
7564984	7570826	Um, um, I'll be nice, I guess.
7570846	7572087	I'm giving a six.
7573567	7574708	Alright, let's recap.
7574748	7576228	It's not up to us, it's up to you.
7576869	7578889	You folks in chat room, get your say.
7579209	7580770	The three songs you can vote for tonight.
7580810	7582731	Song number one, Pendulum, Hold Your Color.
7588393	7593895	And song number two you can vote for tonight is Estero with OG Bitch, the Orange Factory Mix.
7601827	7606433	And song number three you can vote for tonight is Captain Jack with Back Home.
7610979	7615124	After hours and hours of listening to that song, my brain is hemorrhaging all night.
7625318	7626759	I turned off the mics in the middle of that.
7627360	7629161	It's probably best they didn't hear my little song there.
7630242	7632704	Loki, this is the part of the show.
7632724	7633724	Place vote now.
7633784	7635366	Send a private message to Sky Chatroom vote.
7636266	7637687	Loki, SimUpdate, what's up?
7638027	7643671	Okay, first off, as I mentioned before, DDR Maniacs is back up for all those who didn't know it.
7644012	7644132	Woo!
7646926	7648287	I was looking for and trying to find a link
7669710	7670511	For the PSP
7688257	7715731	the DDR one in action with full background videos and it looks pretty cool so far unfortunately all the links are down for it right now and the Beatmania one is available right now I tried downloading it to my PSP but I can't get it to play anything so both of these are still a work in progress right now anyways if you're interested in the link I will post it in the chat room sweet
7717230	7717631	Is that it?
7718853	7720396	That's pretty much it for now.
7720416	7725966	Other than that, Bill Mysell's back up too.
7725986	7727449	Are they still begging for money?
7728671	7728992	I'm sure.
7730673	7734914	No, they're putting up more media stuff right now, like sim file stuff.
7735715	7736135	Good times.
7737675	7742597	Oh, I forgot to check and see if they had more sim files up there for Max Remix.
7742797	7743217	Oh, goody.
7743497	7745137	This is what the world needs, more Max Remixes.
7745418	7750099	I don't think that their sim files are up quite yet, but I'm sure that pretty soon they will be.
7750619	7756324	I know that actually you can go on ddrmaniax.net.
7756364	7761969	They have a build in progress right now for Step Mania 4, which is almost done.
7762850	7764151	So that should be pretty cool.
7765192	7771257	But yeah, sim file database, not too much right now for that.
7772598	7776822	But I'm thinking though, I mean they've already got some rave songs in there and
7778618	7781820	I'm sure there'll be Max remixes in here pretty soon.
7781840	7782200	Hey, wait a minute.
7782220	7784561	I thought my style was going to have this whole new look when it came back.
7784601	7785261	It looks the same.
7786262	7787402	Well, apparently not.
7787963	7796147	Apparently they lied to us, much like they lied to me when I donated money and said I was going to get special access to an FTP site that never happened.
7796807	7798748	So that's why I never donate to them.
7798868	7799448	Oh, here we go.
7799628	7800309	Rave Unlimited.
7800429	7800889	There you go.
7801069	7803110	Max Unlimited remix.
7803190	7804011	Just what the world needs.
7805131	7805932	Alright, um...
7809454	7814816	Now we're going to get to the part of the show where we ask our buddy Xtifer to come on and tell us about the movies.
7814836	7815796	Did you see a movie this week?
7816396	7817357	I did see a movie this week.
7817397	7820078	Alright, then you know it's time for Xtifer's movie review.
7820858	7827320	The captain, the captain, the captain.
7827340	7827800	Alright.
7827900	7830261	I just wanted to go, like, stop it.
7830301	7831141	Stop playing that song.
7831421	7831721	Stop it.
7833102	7834302	Alright, so what did you see this week?
7835223	7836603	Okay, so I saw Saw 2.
7840257	7866660	and um it was bloody if you like blood and if you like to be scared then Saw 2 is the movie to see I really was scared I was genuinely scared at this movie um I'm easily scared though at films so I mean just don't take that from me I mean you may want to take a look at the reviews on RottenTomato.com it got like really horrible reviews um I don't know I it's I've never seen Saw 1
7868652	7875256	So, um, I've never, I never saw that, um, although I want to see, I want a seesaw for Christmas.
7876397	7882000	Um, so, but no, it's, it was really, um, cool.
7882020	7888905	My sister saw the first one, and, um, she had, uh, told, filled me in on most of the first one before we saw the film.
7889325	7894428	But I didn't expect the beginning, I just did, like, my mouth was open, I was just like, I was horrified.
7894528	7896089	It was, it was really scary to me.
7896738	7901102	But again, I'm kind of a pussy when it comes to scary movies.
7901543	7902343	Rob, you should know that.
7902463	7903524	Oh my god, yes.
7903645	7904205	Oh my god.
7904365	7907188	I'm surprised you don't wet your pants at this movie.
7907728	7909270	I've never told you if I have or not.
7909370	7910071	I might have.
7910711	7911332	No, I'm kidding.
7912233	7913314	No, not really.
7914114	7914675	I am...
7915819	7917120	Kind of impressed by it.
7917200	7918521	I thought it was like Silent Hill.
7918641	7923925	I thought it looked like the look and feel of Silent Hill, the way that it was all set up and everything.
7924085	7927788	Now, the other thing about this movie is that it seems incredibly, extremely, and horribly violent.
7927988	7929729	Like, seriously violent.
7929849	7931350	Like, fucking violent.
7932071	7934913	It is very violent, and people bleeding all over the place.
7935253	7941178	But the way the place looks is just exactly like something you see right out of that video game.
7942359	7944040	And I just was very...
7944941	7947222	Very, like, just, it was just hard to watch.
7947242	7949823	Why don't you tell me something about, like, a trap?
7950243	7956105	I don't know if it's a spoiler, but you were saying, like, a trap where razor blades are cutting off somebody's arm or something.
7956305	7970469	Yeah, there's, like, a plexiglass box with two openings, and, you see, the whole premise is these people are poisoned, and they have to find their antidotes to this toxin that they've been breathing in for, like, you know, the last two hours.
7971400	7993529	and they're trying to find them throughout this house and one of the girls walks into a room with this plexiglass box like hanging from the ceiling with two openings where hands can go through and an antidote like a syringe is in the middle just standing up and she, they're all, you know, totally No, no.
7993549	7994029	No.
7994049	7995649	Okay, long story short, bloody.
7996170	7996910	No, no.
7997370	7999572	Jamie's about to die from my story.
7999612	8001293	How does it fucking feel to want?
8003194	8005055	Um, it's my review, damn it.
8006977	8010499	No, I, um, bloody, bloody, etc.
8010839	8013401	You know, that's pretty much, I'll talk about it tomorrow.
8013461	8014162	How's about that?
8015042	8015343	Okay.
8015803	8018705	Don't listen to my show tomorrow, DarkSakura, or Jamie.
8019807	8048558	but uh... no but listen because you know you want to uh... and uh... so I actually recommend it I mean if you don't like if you like um... violence to the level of pornography level it wasn't but the thing is I didn't really pay attention to the blood I was genuinely so if you like the guinea pig project you'll like Saw 2 if you like the I've never seen the guinea pig if you like Faces of Death you'll probably like Saw 2 no no no no no it was more scary than gory to me I mean sure there was blood
8049378	8051043	It was a good Halloween movie.
8058103	8059103	Happy Halloween!
8059143	8059944	Thumbs up?

8063104	8065645	Two stumps up.
8066646	8067026	Alright.
8068546	8079849	Anyway, we're going to go to another break and in this break we're going to hear some stuff from, since one of our callers earlier brought up DDR with Mario, I suppose we could do some music from DDR with Mario.
8080210	8084391	So we'll do that and we'll be back with more Orange Lounge Radio right after this.
8085522	8087664	and maybe some more Skype calls if we can get into it.
8087724	8091927	We also definitely have to do the FUs of the week and do the cage match winner as well.
8092247	8094549	So we'll be... Number three.
8095770	8096470	We'll see, we'll see.
8097431	8101674	Alright, we'll be back after this with some DDR with Mario music and Orange Lodge Radio.
8471539	8472780	Orange Lounge Radio.

8476102	8484189	Hi kids, we're back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
8484209	8486731	We're about ready to reveal who won tonight's cage match.

8591775	8593296	Would you read it in a box?
8593456	8594476	Would you read it with a fox?
8595197	8598199	I would read it in a box with a fox.
8599871	8600651	While eating logs?
8601412	8602372	While eating a box.
8603672	8603972	All right.
8604272	8606933	Spell extoverse.

8639798	8640658	Pump Up the Volume.
8641178	8642279	It's a music request show.
8642399	8646960	I've taken to doing it every other Tuesday just because school obligates me.
8646980	8648220	So you're off this week, actually, right?
8648320	8649221	This week I will be off.
8649621	8651662	Unless I get really bored and then I might do something.
8652462	8653082	So you never know.
8654122	8655963	But the week after I will be back live again.

8683138	8684618	So it's a Vanilla Sky reunion.
8684638	8687080	It should be a barrel of monkeys' laughs.
8687240	8688020	It's going to be a fun show.
8688341	8688801	So tune in.
8689101	8690022	Wednesday night, 7 o'clock.

8695865	8696405	New topic.
8697206	8697746	Cage match.
8697766	8699987	Let's talk about who won tonight's cage match.
8700828	8702689	The winner of tonight's cage match was...
8705540	8706021	Drumroll.
8706421	8707522	Extifer, I need a drumroll.
8707983	8709405	Thank you.
8709825	8714791	Song that won tonight was... Pendulum with Hold Your Color.
8716714	8717535	Fourth week.
8718736	8719397	Retired.
8720498	8721019	Retired!
8723339	8724600	That is so sad.
8724660	8727981	I mean, you guys, don't you guys care about Captain Jack?
8728481	8730062	I mean, didn't he die for you?
8731282	8732503	Didn't he die for your sins?
8733483	8735004	Maybe.
8735044	8736604	Isn't he going to be coming back soon?
8737665	8738245	I mean, come on.
8738625	8739386	Come on, people.
8739686	8739966	All right.
8740686	8741306	Get off the show.
8741326	8741687	No, I'm kidding.
8743127	8744788	Stop gaying up the show, Extover.
8745308	8746469	Well, I'm sorry, Rob.
8746969	8747409	Okay?
8747789	8748950	But I thought he was fabulous.
8751330	8752371	Here, Loki, here's your mic.
8753732	8754932	I'm just kidding, you don't have to leave.
8755793	8756133	Okay.
8756933	8757713	That was great.
8759434	8759734	Anyway.
8761095	8761895	So there it is, four weeks ago.
8761915	8762835	This show needs more gay.
8763155	8764776	Three new songs.
8764856	8767257	New, new, newbie, new, newbian songs next week.
8768953	8770074	I already know what song I'm putting in.
8770114	8773296	I'm not allowing Miklatov to pick my song next week.
8773596	8776338	Actually, is he on?
8777038	8782062	I'm going to see if he's on AIM right now, because I might send him a message letting him know.
8782102	8785424	Because I know if he is online, he's too good to be listening to this program.
8786685	8789006	But I want to let him know that he won.
8789687	8790768	Oh, he's not online right now.
8790808	8791128	Denied.
8793595	8793875	DarkSakura
8821436	8823976	DarkSakura, why is it that we do the FUs of the week every single week?
8828598	8830699	Oh, I like this.
8830719	8831759	This is video game sounding.
8834940	8836981	Burn, fire, kill, die, burn.
8837021	8838041	Dude, it's sports fun.
8838081	8838721	They're pretty cool.
8838882	8839682	I might change it, though.
8841485	8843387	But, um, my first F.U.
8843427	8844447	goes to the cage match.
8845969	8846990	Um, my second F.U.
8847070	8848791	goes toward, uh, Captain Jack.
8850092	8850653	For dying.
8851253	8851894	How dare he?
8851914	8861682	Um, no, this isn't Schlagwort, it's Schwarzstein.
8863360	8865781	Um, another F you goes to being tired.
8867061	8875063	And, uh, another F you goes toward basically being flaked on by people.
8877204	8879604	As I look across the room and I'll say that.
8881045	8882325	I flaked on you, I'm sorry.
8882645	8883505	I forgot to call you.
8884406	8887987	Because I went to Red Lobster.
8888407	8892908	F you to Red Lobster for your tasty food that made me
8894429	8902454	My first FU goes to the goddamn slow people that have to be in front of me every time I go out driving.
8919110	8923212	You know, it's just really retarded people out there that just don't pay attention.
8923272	8925394	It's always women on their goddamn cell phones.
8925794	8935680	I'm sorry, I have given you plenty of chances to, you know, redeem yourself, but everywhere I look, there's a goddamn woman on her cell phone driving a stupid SUV, nearly hitting something.
8936360	8936980	All the time.
8937521	8941023	I mean, literally, you cannot go outside without seeing something like that.
8941883	8942323	It's crazy.
8942764	8944445	Well, you know what SUV stands for.
8945625	8948067	The Stupid Useless Vehicle for Stupid Useless People.
8951798	8973122	Anyways, um, so, fuck them, cause they suck, and, also, uh, fuck the fact that I haven't had any time playing more Final Fantasy, um, really getting behind on that, and trying to cram more minutes into the day is just not working, so, yeah, it sucks, um, also, in general, just, um,
8974633	8978615	And also, fuck those stupid people on Craigslist that want to charge $135 for a web page design, and
8994585	8995685	I don't know, maybe I should... I'm done.
9020540	9022741	I'm gonna do a new FU song as well tonight, I think.
9023762	9024242	I'm keeping mine.
9024262	9025503	Alright, that's fine.
9025683	9026124	I like yours.
9026664	9026984	For now.
9027144	9027845	I'm gonna change mine.
9032228	9037831	Um, I'd like to give an FU, um, oh, cute, I like that.
9038872	9041614	Uh, I'd like to give an FU to our, um, apartment complex.
9042981	9051470	Because our apartment complex, I called them on Monday to tell them that the washer in the apartment was broken, and it took them until today to just bring them a new washer.
9051490	9052972	And you know why it finally happened today?
9053232	9056055	Because when I called the office, I actually got to speak to the general manager.
9056335	9057937	And that's the only reason it got taken care of today.
9058217	9059959	She had my problem fixed in five minutes.
9060740	9062862	Seriously, it was just, it was a nightmare.
9062902	9064604	And you know, not having a washer...
9065553	9068735	is just plain fucking insane.
9069415	9073217	You have to, like, rely on your friends to have time to let you use their washer.
9073757	9073997	Yeah.
9074137	9080640	You know, because I'm not going to go to no laundromat or whatever to spend money and wash and dry my clothes.
9081100	9081400	Anyways.
9082081	9083641	Alright.
9086222	9091805	Let's, um, I think that's pretty much my major FU, otherwise FU to the fact that I am going to have
9093430	9095993	I'm gonna be so, so busy at work in the next couple weeks.
9096073	9096654	I'm gonna cry.
9096794	9097595	I have another one, Rob.
9097715	9098395	Um, but that's alright.
9098796	9099236	What can you do?
9099677	9102680	Alright, then let's go back to Jamie's music so she can get her last FU up.
9102960	9107265	Um, my last FU is to myself for leaving directions to somewhere at home, so I have to get back to them.
9107966	9108206	Dope.
9109427	9112290	Alright, let's go and check out some of our guest FUs.
9112351	9113372	Started off with DDR Angel.
9114059	9127633	Well, I usually don't bitch about a game, per se, or what happened in the game, but this one redeems itself, you see, because usually you go into a group and hopefully good things happen and you level and blah blah blah, whatever.
9127913	9129354	This guy was a complete butthead, though.
9129995	9153057	because as soon as I rolled on the object that I needed, he was like, you don't need that, you're a priest, so you know what, fuck you, and fuck you to kicking me out of the group after you didn't get your way, I mean, it was just massive monster player kill, go in the middle of the mob, run out, and kill the priest, fuck you, and that's
9153578	9156342	Thanks to her, you're FUs of the week.
9168159	9173784	Um, FU to working for a living.
9173984	9176086	I second DarkSakura's FU.
9176606	9181170	I went and applied for another job today, so maybe I'll have two.
9182531	9184192	And, you know, I don't know.
9184232	9189497	Like, I'm just not looking forward to working two jobs, especially the job that I applied for is retail.
9190337	9191939	And I'm the retail king.
9191959	9194921	But you're going to work at my favorite store and you can get me discounts.
9194961	9195602	I'm so excited.
9195722	9197223	That's fucking great.
9198044	9198484	Um, for you.
9199324	9202445	I, on the other hand, am not really happy for it.
9202585	9204425	But, you know, I mean, it's cool.
9204445	9206626	I mean, I just need the extra money.
9206926	9209546	So, I mean, in the long run, it'll be good for me.
9209646	9212487	But at the same time, fuck you to working for a living.
9214247	9215127	I forgot something.
9215247	9216227	Ow, I just hurt myself.
9216828	9220908	Um, fuck you to not having enough time to do artwork and play video games.
9220988	9221689	That just sucks.
9222489	9224109	Manwhore's getting too expensive, Christopher.
9226960	9235788	They are, I mean, you know, and I pay the extra so that I can, you know, suck their assholes Oh my god!
9236048	9250761	And, you know, that's like 120 bucks extra You're cut off, shut up I'm sorry, but, you know, but, you know, I think that it's a really horrible thing when you have to charge extra for that
9252045	9253326	Can I please go to the chatroom?
9253346	9255207	It's all just jokes, people.
9255367	9257188	It's okay to have sexual humor.
9257208	9258809	I saw some people in the chatroom earlier.
9259169	9260910	It's okay, just get over it.
9263192	9265813	I'm not gonna change, so, you know, leave if you don't like it.
9266874	9271777	The views and opinions expressed by Xifer are not necessarily that of the show's.
9272337	9275119	Misty says, fuck my schedule for work this week.
9275159	9280502	Of all the weeks that I could go in later because my mom's on vacation this week, I get scheduled for 8am or earlier.

9291622	9294243	I've gone to the local Acura repair shop and they can't fix it.
9295764	9298225	So fuck them for not being able to fix their own cars.

9480345	9480625	Yeah.
9480666	9482827	Who told her she could put out one, let alone two?
9482847	9483447	I don't know.
9484088	9484368	Bitch.
9484994	9488117	Do you hear that she's going to be making indie films now to get some street cred?
9488618	9489899	She signed up with some indie films.
9490339	9491500	Maybe she'll die.
9491901	9495384	Hopefully those indie films that are porn will involve lots of nudity.
9495865	9496465	Is that what you want?
9496665	9499528	I think she should do a remake of the Captain Jack song we heard tonight.
9500569	9500929	You think so?
9501170	9501590	Yeah, I do.
9501610	9502271	That would be good times.
9503556	9515931	Alright, um, we're gonna do, um, actually we're gonna go to one more break, but there's a purpose behind this break, because I wanted to play this for you guys tonight at some point, um, because I just got this, um, from our buddy Miklatov, and he says it's very cool, and I want to play it for you guys.
9516392	9521238	Um, it's in the Kiriyama Oka track, it's actually System Romance, but it's not the song that we know it from 2DX.
9522159	9522339	More news!
9522359	9522539	Yes.
9541499	9542720	Okay, more news than it is.
9543321	9545803	And maybe some Ask Orange Lounge if we have time?
9545983	9546163	Sure.
9546383	9547664	If we have time, but we don't know tonight.
9547704	9549086	Tonight, we may not get to do it.
9549486	9550627	So, anyway, here we go.
9550647	9553469	Akira Yamaoka with a guitar version of Sister Romance.
9553570	9553770	Enjoy.
9571113	9571675	Thanks for watching!
9684479	9685184	Thanks for watching!
9712592	9714875	Thanks for watching!
9778054	9779124	Thanks for watching!
9804865	9805387	DJ Ranma S
9851363	9855244	Akira Yamaoka with an instrumental version of System Romance.
9855904	9862685	Okay, I promised somebody that we could do one more call over the Skype line, so we're going to go ahead and go to the Skype line for one last call before we get to some more news.
9863045	9863985	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
9865266	9866366	Hey, Sky, it's John Field.
9866946	9867826	Hey, John, what's on your mind?
9869507	9870247	I'm doing okay.
9871567	9872467	What's on your mind tonight?
9873747	9875928	Well, I've got a pretty big amount to make.
9876248	9876588	Okay.
9877999	9885923	A couple months back, I made an announcement on Orange Lounge Radio, the official announcement about it, that I would be starting up a Phantasy Star Online Mishima.
9886563	9886963	Oh, okay.
9888083	9889444	And I've got good news about that.
9891245	9895667	The first episode will be released tomorrow, and I'll be posting a link to it in the chat room.
9896527	9897147	Oh, very cool.
9897187	9900189	Now, explain for those that might not know, what is a Mishima?
9901309	9905611	A Mishima is basically the idea of taking a video game, using the characters in it,
9906444	9910826	and using that to tell a story that's different from what the actual game is like.
9910846	9913647	Sort of like what Red vs. Blue did for Halo.
9913847	9918669	Right, and I remember I saw a commercial on TV the other day that was The Sims 2, and it was a very similar kind of thing.
9918769	9924091	So a lot of folks like that Red vs. Blue stuff, so now you made one for Phantasy Star Online.
9925052	9925272	Yeah.
9925532	9925932	Very cool.
9925952	9926412	What's it called?
9927693	9931915	It's called The Monster Within, and the first episode, like I said, will be out tomorrow.
9932175	9932355	Mm-hmm.
9933149	9936312	If it's not up on Archive.org, I'll be hosting it on my own web space.
9936732	9936972	Okay.
9937452	9943557	And hopefully this will be maybe every few weeks or so, I'll have another release out.
9943838	9946279	Give us a little hint as to the plot of the first episode.
9947741	9952104	The plot of the first episode is sort of, it takes place before the actual game starts.
9952164	9956067	It's sort of like you're there seeing the explosion on Red Gold.
9956728	9956948	Hmm.
9957898	9960398	Okay, so a little bit of a prequel going on here.
9960719	9963099	You going to send this to some folks at Sega, see what they think of it?
9964439	9968020	Actually, I'm already working with a contact inside Sega.
9968100	9970400	It's the GM for Blueburst, Clumsy Orchid.
9970800	9971160	Awesome.
9971260	9972040	Well, good luck with that.
9972080	9973321	I hope you have a good time.
9973381	9975421	And hey, name drop Orin's mom's name somewhere, okay?
9976581	9976881	Okay.
9976901	9977501	Just messing with you.
9977521	9978382	All right, have a good one.
9978402	9979622	Thanks for, and good luck with that.
9979662	9980262	Let us know how it does.
9980502	9982042	And post the link in the chat room so we can check it out.
9982982	9983162	Right.
9983342	9983603	All right.
9984043	9984343	Okay.
9984523	9984823	Later.
9985763	9985983	Bye.
9986063	9986243	Bye.
9987449	9987849	All right.
9989349	9990310	Those are always a good time.
9990610	10001932	Oh, I forgot to ask if it was going to be like a comedy or a drama kind of thing, because, you know, Red vs. Blue is funny stuff, but the way that kind of sounded, it sounded like it might be a more serious thing, so hopefully it's a little bit of both, though.
10001972	10002593	Those are the best.
10002793	10004253	A little bit of both is always a good time.
10004853	10009414	All right, Loki said he had some news for us, so I want to go ahead and let him have a chance to talk about some news.
10009774	10012495	And I think I have something else, too, so we got a lot of news here in the last 15 minutes.
10013584	10029461	Okay, anyways, um, stuff I was going to be talking about, um, and we posted this to the site earlier this week about this new dance game that's coming out by the creators of Get on the Mic, and it actually used to be called Get on the Floor, but now it's Flow, the Urban Dance Uprising.
10030522	10032064	Um, this game is...
10032642	10034783	The Urban Dance Uprising.
10034843	10036284	Yes, Dance Uprising.
10036304	10039125	Because, you know, Uprising is like a revolution, I guess.
10040366	10041727	But it's basically DDR.
10042067	10043848	I mean, in every sense.
10044208	10048470	It is so much like DDR that I'm sure we'll see the lawsuit in a few months here.
10048550	10050991	But what can I say?
10051031	10053032	It's all breakbeat music, which is kind of cool.
10053652	10055233	You've got some pretty good tracks in it.
10055253	10060196	A lot of them I didn't recognize because, I mean, I like breakbeat and stuff, but I don't really...
10061499	10062440	Thank you for watching!
10076241	10086067	But two of the main songs I wanted to mention was The Breaks by Curtis Blow and 8th Wonder by Sugar Hill Gang, which are going to be two of the big songs in it.
10086408	10086948	Interesting.
10087008	10088809	But it's basically VDR.
10089329	10090210	Very, very similar.
10092371	10094192	So that was the one I wanted to mention.
10094833	10099396	I think that was the only story I had, if I remember correctly.
10100316	10100536	Yeah.
10100717	10101257	Okay.
10101497	10102378	Just that dance game.
10103098	10104459	It'll be interesting to check out.
10104926	10107449	I got a couple other things I want to add, which I think is very interesting.
10107709	10115840	DDR Freak is reporting this week that Carl's Jr., as we know it here on the West Coast, but on the East Coast they call it Hardee's, but same thing.
10116120	10122107	They're actually going to be running a promotion this November where DDR is going to be advertised on their drink cups.
10122827	10123667	But that's very interesting.
10123727	10138035	On their 44-ounce, like their super drink cups, they're going to advertise like DDR games, which I think is very interesting because you consider the types of things that are usually advertised on the side of fast food drink cups, and it's like, well, Extifer, you drink a lot of fast food cups, so what kind of... I'm just kidding.
10138375	10139595	I saw you grab the mic.
10139615	10140836	No, you said Carl's Jr., right?
10140876	10141056	Yes.
10141496	10142737	Oh, I love Carl's Jr.
10142937	10144598	Okay, or Hardee's if you're on the East Coast.
10144898	10145398	Or Hardee's.
10145718	10146259	Carl's Jr.
10146299	10146959	is the best.
10147637	10148418	It's pretty good.
10148738	10151840	And I think that makes it even better.
10152120	10155282	You know I once dated somebody who refused to eat at Carl's Jr.
10155342	10156583	because Carl's Jr.
10156663	10160426	was giving secret money to anti-gay Republican organizations, supposedly.
10160728	10164911	Call me Republican and anti-gay because I love Carl's Jr.
10165411	10170714	Those Western bacons will make me... They are the Western bacon cheeseburger.
10170794	10176377	Anyway, so usually they advertise what, like Disney movies on the side of drink cups and whatever else is going on.
10176998	10179599	But DDR is going to be a promotion at Carl's Jr.
10179860	10180800	That's very interesting.
10181080	10181340	It is.
10181541	10182101	It's interesting.
10182281	10183542	Also, here's the thing.
10184302	10188004	Inside the store, there's going to be a big advertising standee and there'll be $5 coupons.
10189750	10190650	We need a Kiriyamaoka revolution
10211624	10218511	I keep forgetting that we have international listeners, so they're like, I don't know if it's Canada or what, but somebody's all, we don't have Hardee's here, where?
10218951	10220493	You're not missing anything, trust me.
10221113	10222595	Their burgers taste like ass.
10222675	10223896	Hardee's sells fried chicken.
10225013	10228295	And they have like, you know, giant sized burgers that taste like ass.
10228595	10234258	Trust me, I used to like, you know, some of their burgers there, but there's this one Carl's Jr.
10234298	10238620	that was right by our house and it was really, um, really bad.
10239060	10246264	I remember probably the pinnacle of their suckiness was when the salt tasted like urine for some reason.
10246284	10250406	Angel, you'd know about that, right?
10254307	10254607	Wow.
10254768	10255989	No.
10257370	10257670	No.
10257750	10259391	Hardee's is cooler than Carl's Jr.
10259411	10261253	though because they have fried chicken and biscuits.
10263082	10264723	I think that they're fine.
10265043	10267284	And if they taste like ass, call me an ass man.
10267964	10270225	I really like... But, Carl's Jr.
10270326	10272286	But, Carl's Jr.
10272346	10274748	has in selected restaurants the green burrito.
10275528	10276508	You know, I don't like green burrito.
10276648	10277769	But you know what I like?
10277929	10278709	I like green burrito.
10278889	10279470	You know what I like?
10279510	10280850	Shut your mouths, women.
10281090	10288334	My fast food of choice, better than Carl's Jr., though, is Jack in the Box, which I know is also not available in all the states.
10288974	10289854	Yak in the crack.
10290395	10291015	Oh, that's great.
10293366	10295287	I found out something like a couple weeks ago.
10295447	10295667	What?
10295947	10299129	About fast food and... It makes you fat?
10299209	10300029	I mean, I do that.
10300089	10300650	No, no, no.
10301690	10303191	We have a chick-fil-a now.
10303851	10304352	Oh, come on.
10304552	10305812	Okay, big whoop.
10306173	10306793	Hey, hey, hey.
10306813	10308774	I freaking grew up with a chick-fil-a.
10308854	10309914	I know, but I didn't.
10310035	10310675	I'm sorry.
10310735	10311615	I didn't, but I didn't.
10311675	10312256	What?
10313120	10314201	Fuck Chick-fil-A.
10314381	10316383	What's the big deal about Chick-fil-A?
10316423	10317984	The crack they put in the Polynesian sauce.
10319325	10319986	I like it.
10320066	10321267	All Chick-fil-A's are closed on Sunday.
10321347	10323569	I know, because they're praising Jesus.
10324335	10328697	But no, I think that it's very admirable that they would take a corporate stance for their beliefs.
10328837	10332660	I agree, and it's good that the employees at least all get one good day off.
10332900	10333640	I freaking hate it.
10333880	10337562	Okay, goddamn Tugboat, you know, Fish and Chips, and Nippon.
10337962	10339763	Both of the places, I love their food.
10339984	10344446	The only time I really have a chance to get some is on Sundays, and they have to go freaking warship.
10345166	10348788	They could do that in the morning like normal people, and they come back to work.
10349469	10353671	You know, some people actually live up to their personal beliefs, maybe.
10354431	10355492	No one does that anymore.
10356633	10357814	That's so passe.
10359535	10363418	Oh, I have to commend anyone who's willing to take a stance like that for what they believe in.
10363458	10364699	I think that it's very admirable.
10365840	10374327	The church crowd, when I used to work at Walmart, when they used to come in, I have horrible stories.
10374927	10376368	It was the worst crowd in the world.
10377449	10382073	I swear, you're praising Jesus, and you want, you know, to be saved, and
10382711	10385193	yet you want to save more money than you want to be saved.
10406661	10409143	I just said it because I thought you guys missed it or something.
10409603	10410243	Never mind.
10410444	10411204	My aim's improving.
10412965	10416948	If I'm going to have fast food, it's all about Panda Express, and I consider Panda Express fast food.
10418189	10423132	If I'm going to have fast food, then I'll have cooked it the night before and take it out of the refrigerator.
10423372	10425774	Funny you said that, Rob, about Panda Express.
10425834	10425954	Why?
10425974	10433659	Because all of a sudden I'm thinking of that little cartoon thing they have on the World of Warcraft site that says Pandoran Express, and I'm going, no!
10433679	10433719	No!
10435160	10437721	Okay, my brain is tainted for the evening.
10437741	10438222	Thank you.
10438262	10446646	Seriously, though, if people who are going to go somewhere the next day, they know that they're going to stop to get fast food, isn't it just easier to pack a lunch?
10446726	10448607	It's cheaper and better for you.
10450428	10453069	I think that everybody should boycott fast food for a week.
10454430	10454950	Good.
10455050	10456531	I don't want to... Good.
10456551	10458132	Get out of my drive-thru.
10458972	10459633	No, seriously.
10459733	10464115	I think that if everybody stopped eating fast food for the duration of one entire week...
10464835	10469939	A regular food out of the refrigerator that you go to the grocery store and have to prepare.
10470780	10477725	After a week, I swear, your general level of health and well-being is going to be very improved.
10477825	10482068	I would make a substantial financial wager that I could go longer without fast food than these two.
10482929	10483569	Oh, I believe it.
10485351	10487032	They wouldn't last five seconds.
10487512	10489194	Oh, yeah, right.
10489554	10491776	Five seconds.
10491936	10492837	I'm going outside.
10493877	10494478	Is this a bet?
10496478	10499960	Official Orange Sounds Radio bet.
10500020	10502461	I am the master of my domain.
10502741	10506083	I bet I can go six fucking months without eating fast food.
10506844	10508184	I will put money in it.
10508985	10512687	If you... I don't believe it.
10512767	10516249	I don't believe that Christopher would be able to right now.
10517029	10520611	If he breaks his fast food goal...
10522196	10526497	Then for every month remaining on the sixth month, he has to pay $10.
10527758	10531018	So, for example, if he makes it four months and then eats fast food, he has to pay $20.
10531058	10532079	To what?
10533019	10534139	To us, for the station.
10536640	10537760	You have to pay our station bill.
10537780	10538280	You're on.
10539581	10540221	I don't eat fast food.
10540261	10541041	I'm not betting shit.
10542182	10543062	Wait a minute, wait a minute.
10544862	10548723	Christopher just agreed to something that Loki and I didn't even say we'd participate in.
10548763	10550904	So now it's all Christopher and how long he can go without fast food.
10551926	10552887	Loki agrees too.
10554349	10555350	I didn't agree to shit.
10556752	10559836	If I don't go and eat fast food, where am I going to get my Best Buy bucks?
10560296	10560537	Really?
10561798	10562299	Steal them?
10564782	10570409	See, that's the same type of consumerism crap that's got this country buried, I swear.
10573775	10577858	Loki just took out like $20 in Best Buy bucks.
10577878	10578358	$22, actually.
10578378	10578738	Wow.
10578778	10580939	Do you know when the last time I ate fast food was?
10581140	10581360	When?
10582060	10584361	Two weeks ago, when I brought a salad.
10585882	10587704	Okay, now what is considered fast food?
10587724	10590605	Because I don't want extrovert to get off on a technicality.
10590685	10593547	I don't really consider McDonald's food.
10593767	10595388	Stepping into a McDonald's?
10595788	10599251	Okay, the only thing that you would ever be allowed to buy from a McDonald's would be a salad.
10599271	10601432	Okay.
10601452	10602492	Because their salads are really good.
10602553	10602973	Okay, then...
10605487	10608795	So is it any place to buy a salad or is it just McDonald's I can buy a salad?
10609035	10609617	Any place.
10609697	10613385	If they've got like salads, good healthy salads, then that's fine.
10613882	10614262	How about this?
10614562	10619063	If you go to a place with a drive-thru, you can't get anything with meat.
10619743	10621604	Wait, no, because that won't work because it's a chicken salad.
10622384	10623304	And the apple pie.
10623824	10625325	Okay, then you can't get anything but a salad.
10625365	10627885	The only thing you could get there would be a salad and a drink to go with it.
10628305	10629566	Okay.
10629626	10632506	As long as it's not sugary.
10632566	10635887	You have to live by my rules of fast food, which is salad.
10636187	10639268	Also, is Subway and Quiznos considered fast food?
10640376	10642261	Hell no, it takes 10 minutes to get fucking sandwiches.
10642301	10643825	No, I don't consider those to be fast food.
10644026	10649019	Okay, but to raise it up a notch, I won't even eat those sandwiches.
10650038	10650859	You can have salads.
10653660	10656802	I do not believe you can go six months without Christmas.
10656942	10657902	I do not believe it.
10657942	10659163	What the fuck are you going to eat?
10659423	10661944	I'm going to eat Nippon every night is what you're going to eat.
10662184	10663505	Isn't Nippon fast food?
10663565	10666447	It's Japanese fast food, so I can't even eat that.
10666467	10667307	It's not fast food.
10667347	10669328	It takes like five minutes to prepare.
10669468	10672170	You can eat at a regular restaurant, like Applebee's or Chili's.
10672230	10672810	Okay, that's fine.
10673516	10678142	You can get salads from these places because salads are good healthy food.
10678782	10683368	But other than that, anything that you eat that you take to work, you have to take your lunch to work.
10684895	10689996	You cannot eat burgers or anything unless you go buy meat and grill yourself a burger.
10690516	10690756	Okay.
10690816	10692217	Or go to Outback because they have really good burgers.
10692277	10693417	I will seriously do this.
10693537	10694537	You guys are totally on.
10695017	10698058	You guys are totally, you guys are going to be eating my ass.
10698078	10699358	Alright, well, I'll tell you what, I'll tell you what.
10699738	10700818	We'll give you some leeway.
10700858	10701939	Tomorrow is Halloween.
10702039	10703099	You can eat your candy corn.
10703299	10704259	I'm starting it tonight.
10704279	10706099	No, no, because I'm starting my diet on the 1st.
10706380	10706720	Oh, okay.
10707020	10708980	So that way I can monitor.
10709660	10709920	Okay.
10710340	10711100	I feel so cool.
10711140	10711741	This is going to be neat.
10712041	10712861	So starting on the 1st.
10714326	10715547	What's halfway through?
10715607	10716967	That's going to be April?
10718188	10723610	We should have like a biggest loser competition where every Orange Lounge radio show we have to all stand on a weight scale.
10723630	10724611	No, because I'm at a freaking plateau.
10724631	10725251	Well, how about this?
10725351	10725831	How about this?
10726371	10733635	We'll go, since we're starting here, the six-month mark will actually be my wedding day, so... You know what?
10734978	10735558	I'm up for this.
10735679	10737219	I'm up for a Biggest Loser competition.
10737500	10739101	Okay, good.
10739261	10741262	We can do it without giving out our weights on the air.
10741302	10741722	Crap.
10741742	10743183	Does that mean Angel's going to do it too?
10743203	10744584	Are you going to participate in this too?
10744764	10744904	Oh, shit.
10745464	10746205	I don't know.
10746285	10749627	Except it's not really fair to me since I've dropped 60 pounds since 2003.
10750127	10751988	Then you're the host.
10752008	10752609	You're the moderator.
10753633	10756434	I'm the mediator, but I'm participating too, but I'm mediating.
10756554	10761297	I like this, forget all this other fast food stuff, it's just going to be strictly the biggest loser.
10761357	10766819	Whoever loses the most weight in, let's make it less than six months, because our listeners don't want to wait that long.
10766839	10768300	It has to be fast food, it has to be something like that.
10768480	10776523	I also though, I also though, I can't rely on weight, being myself, seeing as how, okay, I will go ahead and say it on the air, I'm a size 12 right now.
10776984	10779785	The last time I was a size 12, I was 30 pounds lighter.
10780936	10783898	So how about whoever loses the most inches off their waist?
10787080	10789761	Whoever loses the most clothing sizes.
10790462	10790762	I don't know.
10790802	10792703	See, now we're getting too complicated and we're running out of show.
10793363	10793824	That's easy.
10793904	10795244	It's not dependent on weight.
10795304	10798526	It's not dependent on really your metabolism.
10798586	10801328	Whoever loses the most clothing sizes.
10802669	10803989	I'm still on the fast food thing.
10804109	10804750	I swear, though.
10804910	10805870	Fast food for me.
10805991	10806351	Here it is.
10806611	10810113	If Christopher can actually go six months with no fast food...
10813345	10820030	I'm trying to think of something I'll do.
10820050	10820090	Ew.
10820450	10820851	No.
10820871	10820911	No.
10820931	10821651	No.
10821711	10822292	No.
10822512	10823633	All sorts of no.
10823653	10823753	Loki!
10824914	10826155	Whose mind is in the gutter?
10828637	10828937	Okay.
10829918	10831379	We'll go ahead and do Biggest Loser.
10832279	10833220	Okay?
10833280	10834761	It's a good motivator for everybody.
10835722	10838224	It's just, we are also, though, going to test BMI.
10841567	10842808	Bite me, I hate BMI.
10843288	10846371	Yeah, but BMI is the most accurate way to test fat loss.
10847872	10849613	I'm going to go buy a BMI counter.
10850153	10850334	Ugh.
10851314	10852135	Hide me.
10852195	10853076	We'll do it by BMI.
10854176	10854797	Sounds good to me.
10858670	10862471	6 months though is an awfully long time for this to finish, to play out.
10862551	10863892	It's April, right?
10864052	10866132	Isn't it 6 months April?
10866212	10867373	We can go, we can make it.
10868073	10871134	You remember how we were saying our lease was 6 months ago?
10871154	10873855	I am not committing to the fast food thing because of my lifestyle.
10873955	10875535	I just know I won't be able to do it.
10875635	10877356	I am freely admitting, but I will cut back.
10877456	10878036	I'll cut back.
10878416	10878716	I will.
10878976	10881017	If we're doing like a basic loser, I will participate.
10882356	10897678	and I'll tell you what, I will make a private live journal community for us but we are going to post running things on the site without giving any specifics out and then we'll be able to let our listeners and if our listeners want to participate in this
10898439	10899560	You know, we'll think of something.
10900560	10904203	But I think, you know, because we'd have to have some way to track that.
10904223	10905743	But you guys, I'll see you in person.
10906684	10909526	But, you know, I encourage our listeners to participate with us on their own.
10910386	10912127	If you don't let me have diet soda, I'm going to cry.
10913228	10913868	Yay!
10914028	10916030	So Angel's going to participate.
10916090	10916630	I'm going to do it.
10917310	10917851	Extra's going to do it.
10917871	10918671	Are you doing it too, Loki?
10919172	10921253	I'm going to eat all fast food.
10921553	10922113	No, you're not.
10922433	10923314	Yes, I am.
10923354	10924675	You're going to be the biggest gainer.
10929810	10933812	We'll have to go double your touch measurement.
10933832	10934693	Oh, no!
10934713	10937875	Okay, so Angel, myself, and XRO will be the biggest loser.
10937895	10939836	Loki will be the biggest loser.
10939856	10943799	Which means I have to tell the entire house when I get back, no fashion wear six months!
10943959	10946841	And they're going to give me like, huh?
10946961	10951464	And to encourage everybody, if anyone wants to go work out, if I'm free, I'll work out with you.
10952405	10954146	I'm doing it on my own, too.
10955461	10956102	We're getting the middle.
10957384	10958745	We're getting the middle, Pat, so I'll be fine.
10958805	10960768	Six months is too damn long.
10961589	10962831	You know what, though?
10963852	10971702	One of the reasons why I'm doing it is because I want to see what kind of benefits this will give me in terms of financial...
10972523	10973103	You don't have vodka?
10995851	10996151	Hello.
10996951	10997211	Okay.
10997371	10998332	My microphone works.
10999152	11000913	Okay, we're going way too far.
11000973	11006174	I do not think this is six months, because if you do it for six months, you're eventually going to get yourself into some healthier habits anyway.
11007354	11009375	How the hell did we get into this topic anyway?
11009555	11010275	It just kind of happened.
11010375	11011176	It was his fault.
11011856	11013436	Yeah, it's his fault.
11013636	11016177	Christopher Fryer.
11016237	11016637	No, I'm kidding.
11016657	11020679	Let's talk about food banks who want some supersized fries.
11021479	11022839	That sounds good right now.
11022859	11024760	That sounds fucking disgusting.
11024820	11025120	Thank you.
11025680	11031223	I know, I was like, shit, I was planning on getting Pizza Hut after the show tonight.
11031283	11036565	Now I have to set a fucking example for my roommate who just made a fucking stupid bet on his show.
11038146	11041167	For every month that you have failed, it's $10 you pay for the show.
11041347	11044769	We're going to think of a prize that you get if you win.
11045169	11047650	If you make it, I will take you out to dinner.
11048110	11048370	Okay.
11049050	11050271	Wherever you want, whenever you want.
11050971	11054691	You're not, you're gonna change your lifestyle for six months for a fucking free dinner?
11055232	11056492	That, it sounds good to me.
11057612	11063633	I, I, you know what, you, you, free dinner's pretty good when you're living on your own, you know what, you know what I mean.
11064454	11065234	Alright, alright.
11065354	11070315	So, yeah, I can see Loki like every week coming in with a big old burger in front of us.
11070395	11072555	I will think of a prize as well to sweeten up the pot.
11073015	11073255	Okay.
11075016	11075816	I'm thinking Red Lobster.
11077679	11081041	I'm going to switch from single quarter pounders to double quarter pounders.
11081261	11084604	I was going to say something, but I'm disgusted and I threw that out there.
11087025	11087766	End of show.
11088006	11088787	Final thoughts.
11089407	11090348	Angel, your final thought.
11092029	11093029	I think I can do this.
11093170	11097432	We'll have to go yell at the roomies at home and tell them no fast food.
11097873	11098053	Ever.
11100034	11100975	Extifer, final thought.
11104421	11107422	Oh, somebody in chat wanted to hear the drumroll one more time.
11110383	11110723	Thank you.
11110743	11113603	That sounds like a really messed up, I mean, Murloc.
11114664	11115464	Addict.
11115544	11117504	I am Sam drumroll or something.
11117804	11119304	Loki, your final thought.
11119805	11129447	My final thought is this is the perfect week for me to actually roll out my hybrid beef slash sausage hamburger with double bacon, double cheese.
11131127	11131407	Yummy.
11133574	11133974	You know what?
11134655	11134995	Here it is.
11135235	11135756	Six months.
11136576	11138598	If you can go six months, I'll buy you a fucking DS.
11142060	11143421	Okay.
11143701	11146043	I'll give you a fucking DS if you can go six months.
11146483	11146723	Okay.
11148304	11148785	Alright, cool.
11149545	11149765	Alright.
11151407	11156669	Um, my final thought would be, um, X-Verse Crazy.
11158429	11159470	DarkSakura, your final thought.
11159910	11163411	Uh, reject false icons, and even better, reject fast food.
11164311	11167132	Oh, fucking chatroom, fucking chatroom.
11168313	11172314	There's gonna be a betting pool for the fucking biggest loser contest we're having.
11172374	11173875	You fucking bet on me.
11174335	11174675	Alright.
11175215	11177476	I think I already won since I did drop 60 pounds.
11178249	11179930	But you're not participating in this competition.
11180030	11182491	I'm monitoring because I'm the help guru.
11182511	11183552	You're setting an example.
11183892	11184692	I'm the example.
11184712	11185393	I'm so cool.
11185833	11186433	Odds are in.
11186754	11187534	Loki is 99 to 1 odds.
11192281	11193242	God, I love you guys.
11193302	11194483	I'm going to get in on that action.
11194643	11195683	I fucking love you guys.
11195823	11196184	All right.
11196644	11199846	Seriously, chat room, you people make this show, and everybody that listens.
11199986	11201647	We love you, chat room.
11201928	11202288	All right.
11202808	11204409	You motivate us to be thin.
11204429	11206231	Actually, I have one other thing.
11206711	11206931	Sure.
11207091	11213355	For all of my fellow Gorillaz fans, they're broadcasting the Manchester show on BBC One, streaming.
11213816	11215777	BBC One, BBC Two.
11216017	11216538	All right, anyway.
11218259	11219420	Fucking, we've got to end the show already.
11219480	11220080	Okay, bye.
11220120	11221161	Last word, Loki.
11222654	11223594	Surprise!
11224795	11229658	That does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live.

11323556	11325337	A fly marrying a bumblebee.
11326577	11327658	I told you I'd shoot.
11328365	11329306	But you didn't believe me.
11330046	11331307	Why didn't you believe me?
11331948	11333349	Happy, happy, joy, joy
11359122	11362613	Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.
11396815	11405858	Okay, the guys just did their weigh-ins for the, uh, and we're not going to say our weight because the whole idea is that we don't have to say our weight, but, oh my god, I was surprised.
11406599	11409960	I hit a certain landmark that I didn't think I was over yet, and I'm like, oh, fuck.
11409980	11411861	Alright, so we'll see what happens.
11414606	11416267	Did I really tell Extra Fried to buy him a DS?
11416787	11417387	God, I'm poor.
11417547	11418087	Yes, you did.
11418127	11419948	We have proof of that.
11419988	11420328	That's fine.
11420348	11421969	If he can go six months without fast food, he earned it.
11421989	11424710	And I bet you anything Jay will get in on that, too.
11425310	11425890	I'll bet you anything.
11426170	11430972	I'm telling you right now, I'm at a plateau right now where I can eat as much fast food as I want, and I stay the same weight, so you know what?
11430992	11433893	To be fair, you won a mat.
11433913	11434433	Okay, okay.
11434453	11436614	You won a mat.
11436654	11436874	Okay.
11436914	11438655	Oh, you are going to participate, too, then, Miss Jay?
11440196	11441256	As a motivator for everybody.
11442242	11442742	I can't believe it.
11442762	11446665	So we're going to track this on the website, like how much weight we all... I'm not eligible for any prizes.
11447405	11450987	I'm still moderating it, so I'm not eligible for any prizes, but I'm doing it for motivation purposes.
11451848	11453449	It's going to be a crazy six months, gang.
11454622	11457663	Yeah, but I've needed to do it since I met you guys, so you know what?
11457963	11458603	It's time to go.
11459043	11460183	One thing, though, that, you know...
11482853	11485035	All right, all I want, if I win, I want sex.
11485315	11487557	Not with any of you, I just want sex in general.
11488157	11488898	We'll hire somebody.
11488978	11489898	All right, sounds awesome.
11490299	11493481	On this note, we really got to pull the plug, guys, so we can get to our podcast.
11493501	11494842	If I win, I want fries.
11494982	11497164	All right, good night, thank you.
11497184	11499465	If you win, I'm buying you five pounds of fries.
11499626	11500206	Oh, hell yeah.
11501947	11502768	Let it be noted.
11503969	11505530	All right, we're done, we're done.
11506210	11509633	Tune back in, 15 seconds, Orange Lodge Radio, video game music.
