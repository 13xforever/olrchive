My curves on the left side and likes on the right.

We're singing viva la vida!

02:12.680 --> 02:19.380

My girl's on the left side, back on the right We're shaking, it's Viva la vida

02:25.880 --> 02:34.080
I woke up tonight, some silver in light From somewhere I heard music playing

02:34.080 --> 02:41.480
The party the people were clanging And what I saw made me believing

02:41.480 --> 02:45.480
We dance through the night, the stars shining bright

02:45.480 --> 02:48.480
And the silence of cool margaritas

02:48.480 --> 02:52.480
All over him like seÃ±oritas

02:52.480 --> 02:56.480
The rising sun shines and we're singing

02:56.480 --> 02:59.480
Ay yi yi yi

02:59.480 --> 03:02.480
Viva la vina

03:02.480 --> 03:06.480
Some curves on the left side and backs on the right

03:06.480 --> 03:09.480
We're singing in viva la vina

03:09.480 --> 03:16.480
Ayayaya, Viva La Vida

03:16.480 --> 03:20.480
The girls on the left side, the blacks on the right

03:20.480 --> 03:23.480
We're singing and here I come, here I come

03:50.480 --> 03:56.480
His hands warm and fine, these boys should be mine

03:56.480 --> 03:59.480
His lungs made me feel like a chili

03:59.480 --> 04:02.480
His body, his shoulders, his willies

04:02.480 --> 04:05.480
And everything, he is the biggest

04:05.480 --> 04:09.480
He asked for a walk, he's stolen my heart

04:09.480 --> 04:12.480
And he held me tight, made me study

04:12.480 --> 04:16.480
Like his son and sweat on his body

04:16.480 --> 04:20.480
This body dance moves like no other

04:20.480 --> 04:23.480
Ay yi yi yi

start it off with one of my favorites this is the one I remember this song

09:22.100 --> 09:28.260
from DDR fourth mix and it's the song that everybody at least in this area the

09:28.260 --> 09:32.780
Sacramento people used to really get down to and I mean literally and and

09:32.780 --> 09:37.540
with it had such a fun little dance to it and people would kind of the lyrics

09:37.540 --> 09:42.260
kind of have you like sing along with it and do a little dance and it was really

09:42.260 --> 09:46.660
cheesy and we all look drunk and stupid but um you know what Captain Jack songs

09:46.660 --> 09:50.660

16:38.760 --> 16:40.760
That's right, DDS!

16:40.760 --> 16:43.760
DTPO!

16:43.760 --> 16:48.760
Welcome back, kids. We're here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 161.

16:48.760 --> 16:51.760
In that break, we heard Only You by Captain Jack from DDR4thMix

16:51.760 --> 16:54.760
and Captain Jack with Holiday the Radio Mix.

16:54.760 --> 16:59.760
Tonight, of course, we played a couple of long versions there, which we don't usually do during our breaks.

16:59.760 --> 17:03.580
but tonight I think we have an excuse to be a little bit different, so there you have

17:03.580 --> 17:09.420
it. I promised our chat room, which by the way is swinging tonight, over at www.orangelaungeradio.com

17:09.420 --> 17:13.460
clicking on chat, I promised them that we would have a major announcement regarding

17:13.460 --> 17:18.540
interactivity and the show a little bit before the program started, and I'm going to reveal

17:18.540 --> 17:26.120
that right now. Here's the big news. As you know, we have the Skype line that allows you

17:26.120 --> 17:30.380
to contact us, you know, and we can talk to you on air.

17:30.380 --> 17:33.060
But sometimes we have a lot of problems with the Skype line with people like being able

17:33.060 --> 17:36.740
to talk to us. They can't hear us or we can't hear them.

17:36.740 --> 17:41.140
And there's the Internet lag or something's going on, so it acts really funny.

17:41.140 --> 17:47.980
So what we've done, excuse me, I'm burping here because I just had Sprite during the

17:47.980 --> 17:51.700
break. And that's the worst McDonald's french fries

17:51.700 --> 17:55.060
verb there. Anyway, so what we did is we've actually purchased

17:55.060 --> 18:00.820
an add-on to Skype that will allow you to call us on a regular telephone and say hello

18:00.820 --> 18:01.820
to us.

18:01.820 --> 18:05.180
So here's the thing though, not only is it a regular phone so you can give us a call

18:05.180 --> 18:08.380
and talk to us, but it's also a message line.

18:08.380 --> 18:11.780
So if you want to call and leave us a message at any time, you can, and we can play that

18:11.780 --> 18:12.780
on the show.

18:12.780 --> 18:16.580
So we thought, with the news regarding Captain Jack, and I'm sure a lot of people have something

18:16.580 --> 18:20.060
they want to say, we thought we could open up this brand new thing and allow you guys

18:20.060 --> 18:24.060
to call in right now, leave some messages, and we'll play them later in the show.

18:24.060 --> 18:28.780
course now guys try to keep it you know it is a three-hour show so we're kind of

18:28.780 --> 18:33.020
looking for you know what's your feedback on how did you react to the

18:33.020 --> 18:38.480
news how was Captain Jack influential to DDR was he the reason you played was you

18:38.480 --> 18:42.580
know he just fun whatever you want to say we've got a line for you guys here

18:42.580 --> 18:46.500
is the number it's not an 800 number you guys so you want to ask mommy or daddy

18:46.500 --> 18:49.860
before you call because it might be a long-distance number it's area code 9 1

18:49.860 --> 18:56.260
916-226-9067 is the brand new Orange Lounge Radio message line.

18:56.260 --> 18:58.260
That's 916-226-9067.

18:58.260 --> 19:03.060
It's open right now if you want to call in and leave us a message.

19:03.060 --> 19:07.820
We do not have, we're not taking live calls at this time, we'll do that later in the show,

19:07.820 --> 19:11.540
and when we take live calls, you will actually be able to call in with a number if you want

19:11.540 --> 19:12.540
as well.

19:12.540 --> 19:15.340
You don't just have to, you got to be careful with that mic extra for it's got like a feedback

19:15.340 --> 19:16.340
thing.

19:16.340 --> 19:20.380
So you don't just have to have Skype to call in, you can actually call us using a regular

19:20.380 --> 19:24.340
telephone as long as you're cool with paying long distance charges.

19:24.340 --> 19:28.380
Or use a cell phone because you've got all those minutes, free long distance.

19:28.380 --> 19:29.380
Exactly.

19:29.380 --> 19:30.380
Exactly.

19:30.380 --> 19:38.340
Alright, so once again the phone number, area code 916-226-9067.

19:38.340 --> 19:40.340
And I'm putting that in chat right now.

19:40.340 --> 19:41.340
916-226-9067.

19:41.340 --> 19:48.100
90-67. Anyway, um, before we get into how was your week, how was your day, obviously

19:48.100 --> 19:53.300
the big, uh, pink elephant sitting in the room right now is, uh, Extifer, no, um, is

19:53.300 --> 20:00.100
the fact that, um, Captain Jack obviously passed away this week, um, which, um, you

20:00.100 --> 20:06.140
know, sucks. How else do you say it sucks? Um, he suffered a second stroke, apparently

20:06.140 --> 20:09.860
he had a stroke, um, a couple years ago, and he had a second stroke, and when he suffered

20:09.860 --> 20:13.180
the second stroke apparently he was at a party in full uniform because I don't

20:13.180 --> 20:16.900
think a picture of Captain Jack exists where he was not in his full uniform

20:16.900 --> 20:21.300
which is part of what made him so awesome but unfortunately he did suffer

20:21.300 --> 20:24.380
a second stroke and it caused him to go into a coma which we posted about

20:24.380 --> 20:28.460
earlier in the week and unfortunately led to his death a little later on in

20:28.460 --> 20:31.960
the week and he was 43 when he passed away which is kind of a young age so

20:31.960 --> 20:36.940
it's really too bad. He is survived by an ex-wife and a son, son's 21 years old I

20:36.940 --> 20:40.940
I believe living in Miami? Something like that?

20:40.940 --> 20:44.940
So, anyway, I thought maybe we could go around before we do a little bit of How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day,

20:44.940 --> 20:48.940
and what do you think about all of it? What did you think of Captain Jack? What do you think about

20:48.940 --> 20:52.940
Captain Jack and DDR? What do you think about the music?

20:52.940 --> 20:56.940
Anything you guys want to say? And we'll start it off with Loki.

20:56.940 --> 21:00.940
Well, I was surprised to hear they had passed away.

21:00.940 --> 21:04.940
Because I remember the whole morning I was trying to see what his condition

21:04.940 --> 21:09.900
was, and a lot of people were, because they were getting sources from a German site, so

21:09.900 --> 21:15.060
translating German we weren't sure if it was, you know, still in coma, or passed away, or

21:15.060 --> 21:18.700
just like, you know. So once he figured it out, you know, and the news hit everybody,

21:18.700 --> 21:26.700
you know, it was, you know, very surprising, that's for sure. The guy's, I don't know,

21:26.700 --> 21:32.700
I wasn't a particular fan of his music, I mean, he was in the category of songs that

21:32.700 --> 21:37.080
they're quite annoying to be played over and over and over in DDR so it wasn't

21:37.080 --> 21:41.840
bad but it wasn't you know he wasn't as horrible say like you know DJ Alligator

21:41.840 --> 21:46.640
or something like that so it was still fun his songs were fun and he's just I

21:46.640 --> 21:51.660
mean he's definitely stayed true to himself I mean he's just very you know

21:51.660 --> 21:57.740
out there you know not change the way he was you know just because of whatever I

21:57.740 --> 22:01.740
I mean, he was definitely strange, that's for sure.

22:01.740 --> 22:04.380
But yeah, it sucks that he's not going to be around.

22:04.380 --> 22:08.740
But I'm sure we're still going to hear his music in DDR.

22:08.740 --> 22:11.580
In fact, probably more so now that he's gone.

22:11.580 --> 22:14.180
So yeah, it's good.

22:14.180 --> 22:18.220
But that's life.

22:18.220 --> 22:19.980
Angel, anything you want to say about it?

22:19.980 --> 22:22.500
Who, by the way, was joining us there during the opening music

22:22.500 --> 22:23.020
there.

22:23.020 --> 22:23.420
Hi, Angel.

22:23.420 --> 22:23.920
Hi.

22:23.920 --> 22:24.420
Hi.

22:24.420 --> 22:27.720
Anything you want to say about Captain Jack?

22:27.720 --> 22:34.040
oh well let's see it the first time i played it or it yeah any song by him i guess um

22:34.600 --> 22:40.120
i think and now correct me if i'm wrong it was like i don't know i was like at scandia

22:40.120 --> 22:48.840
back in the bay area there and uh we were playing it on a second third mix duo thing yeah i'm not

22:48.840 --> 22:53.960
quite sure on that but i think so so that's the first time that i ever played one of his songs

22:53.960 --> 23:00.200
and you know I still like him and you know good stuff and I'm sorry to hear

23:00.200 --> 23:05.040
that he did pass away this week that was kind of a shocker actually DJ I want to

23:05.040 --> 23:10.400
run the s one of our buddies told me on aim we were like talking and stuff and

23:10.400 --> 23:15.320
he was like hey did you hear my what huh so he like linked me to it and to the

23:15.320 --> 23:19.920
website that was announcing that he was in a coma and stuff it's just sad huh

23:19.920 --> 23:29.640
I kind of see Captain Jack as one of like the three big artists in the beginnings of

23:29.640 --> 23:34.560
DDR, the other two being Smile DK and Erotic, because like those three bands kind of showed

23:34.560 --> 23:40.720
up in every early mix and continue to show up in a lot of DDR mixes today.

23:40.720 --> 23:48.220
And where Smile DK is kind of bubblegum, pop girl stuff, and Erotic is, I don't know what

23:48.220 --> 23:52.440
the hell you call erotic. Captain Jack is quite simply the shit. Captain Jack is the

23:52.440 --> 24:00.320
shit. He's the man. I mean, a little bit eccentric, yes, but that's cool because his music was

24:00.320 --> 24:06.020
just a lot of dumb fun and I know, and that's kind of what DDR is all about. DDR is kind

24:06.020 --> 24:12.120
of dumb fun. And so Captain Jack, you know, he just wants to be surrounded by hot bitches

24:12.120 --> 24:16.960
and dance. That's really what Captain Jack was all about, was hot bitches and dancing.

24:16.960 --> 24:22.720
And you know, I think that's awesome. And that's just what DDR is all about, is having

24:22.720 --> 24:25.880
fun, and I think that's what Captain Jack's music was all about, is fun. Is it ever gonna

24:25.880 --> 24:33.520
win a Grammy? No. Is it, you know, the Oscar-winning soundtrack music? No. Is it even critically

24:33.520 --> 24:40.400
acclaimed ever? No. It's just, it's fun, mindless, happy, bouncy music, and that's what DDR is

24:40.400 --> 24:43.280
all about. So that's why Captain Jack's the man.

24:43.280 --> 24:50.120
What made it ironic about the whole thing was last week after the show I decided to

24:50.120 --> 24:59.500
go out in the living room and play EX2 for the first time and the song that's on there

24:59.500 --> 25:04.660
was one of the first ones I actually played so hearing what happened earlier this week

25:04.660 --> 25:06.440
I was like what?

25:06.440 --> 25:12.080
So, I don't know, it's just kind of, kind of, well, yeah, like I said, ironic, so...

25:12.080 --> 25:13.080
I don't know.

25:13.080 --> 25:14.080
It was just weird.

25:14.080 --> 25:15.080
It's like, wait.

25:15.080 --> 25:20.040
XFR, I would ask you, but I know you don't play enough DDR to probably even know who

25:20.040 --> 25:21.040
Gavin Jack is, or...

25:21.040 --> 25:22.040
The guy that died?

25:22.040 --> 25:23.040
Yeah, he...

25:23.040 --> 25:24.040
I'm guessing.

25:24.040 --> 25:25.040
Yes, he is the guy that died this week.

25:25.040 --> 25:26.040
Oh, okay.

25:26.040 --> 25:27.040
Um, my condolences.

25:27.040 --> 25:28.040
Okay, yeah.

25:28.040 --> 25:29.040
Well, you know...

25:29.040 --> 25:30.040
Et cetera.

25:30.040 --> 25:33.680
You know, it's, it's pretty interesting how the Bomani community and the music gaming

25:33.680 --> 25:35.440
community in general has kind of been responding.

25:35.440 --> 25:40.720
I know the article that Loki posted on it, I don't know if it made the run-arounds and

25:40.720 --> 25:46.320
blogs and stuff, but the story about Captain Jack's passing has had more hits than anything

25:46.320 --> 25:47.720
ever on our website.

25:47.720 --> 25:52.040
I mean, it's something like 1,800 hits and counting for that story.

25:52.040 --> 25:53.040
It's amazing.

25:53.040 --> 25:58.080
And then, of course, on DDR Freak, you have the largest message board for music gaming.

25:58.080 --> 26:01.280
You have the folks that are putting the little triangles in their signature that look like

26:01.280 --> 26:02.280
the little black ribbon.

26:02.280 --> 26:09.280
I think that's kind of interesting, and you just really see in the thread about Captain Jack passing on,

26:09.280 --> 26:13.280
you really see just a lot of people talking about how, you know what, Captain Jack music was just fun,

26:13.280 --> 26:17.280
and it was stuff that got me up on the machine and just got me into the game and got me into playing DDR,

26:17.280 --> 26:22.280
and it's just really sad to kind of see that there won't be more Captain Jack music.

26:22.280 --> 26:28.280
I mean, Captain Jack music and DDR, yes, maybe, but Captain Jack music, new stuff in general, no.

26:28.280 --> 26:29.280
So it's just kind of too bad.

26:29.280 --> 26:40.280
And another thing I could point out is, you know, you often wonder, you know, if I ever pass away, will people, you know, find out about it and stuff like that?

26:40.280 --> 26:46.280
And I wonder if he wondered the same thing, because now look at the response after, you know, he passed away and stuff, and so...

26:46.280 --> 26:54.280
Kind of interesting. I bet no record company here in this country had any idea how big of a following Captain Jagger really had in this country.

26:54.280 --> 26:56.720
You know, it's kind of amazing. So

26:57.800 --> 26:59.680
Huh? I don't know what else to say

26:59.680 --> 27:04.160
I don't want to turn this into a three-hour sob fest because honestly it's not we're all about that's not what Captain Jack was all

27:04.160 --> 27:09.960
About so yeah, he wants just a party. So let's like we're not gonna have a funeral

27:09.960 --> 27:12.960
I was saying in the chat room earlier tonight. We're not gonna have a funeral. We're gonna have a funeral

27:13.360 --> 27:18.480
Yeah with hot bitches with hot bitches that's because that's that's what Captain Jack was all about with hot bitches

27:18.480 --> 27:21.800
What okay hot female dogs? Okay. Yeah. Yeah

27:21.800 --> 27:25.800
Release the dogs. Release the hounds.

27:25.800 --> 27:32.800
Alright, again if you want to call and leave a message on our message line, it's 916-226-9067

27:32.800 --> 27:37.800
and we'll be playing some of your messages and your thoughts about Captain Jack a little later in the program.

27:37.800 --> 27:43.800
What else do I want to say on the whole thing? Oh yes, of course we had some requests

27:43.800 --> 27:50.800
if we could maybe play a little something and just kind of give Captain Jack an appropriate

27:50.800 --> 27:56.880
21 gun salute. So we're going to give Captain Jack a 21 gun salute, or as somebody suggested

27:56.880 --> 28:03.720
in the chat room actually, a 21 arrow salute. So however you want to imagine it, this is

28:03.720 --> 28:06.440
we're going to give Captain Jack a moment of silence, an orange launch radio moment

28:06.440 --> 28:11.520
of silence, and a 21 gun salute. So if you would all please, a moment of silence and

28:11.520 --> 28:18.520
a salute.

28:41.520 --> 28:48.520
and to that you know Captain Jack would have followed up with

28:49.360 --> 28:52.840
gooooo left go right go left go left go right go left

28:52.840 --> 28:55.920
the sex on the right

28:55.920 --> 29:00.080
those little words I picked up on when you were playing

29:00.080 --> 29:03.320
the vita la vita song we were playing for the show?

29:03.320 --> 29:07.280
live in la vita loca? no not really

29:07.280 --> 29:11.360
let's get into orange lounge radio and what we're all about

29:11.360 --> 29:14.840
Hello kids who are listening to us, maybe for the first time.

29:14.840 --> 29:19.040
We're just a radio program about the music games and video gaming in general,

29:19.040 --> 29:21.800
but sometimes we like to talk about ourselves.

29:21.800 --> 29:24.280
It's kind of like, imagine if you were going out to Denny's

29:24.280 --> 29:26.000
after the football game.

29:26.000 --> 29:27.560
Sure, you talk about the football game a little bit,

29:27.560 --> 29:28.760
but you talk about other stuff too.

29:28.760 --> 29:30.160
And that's what we're all about here at Orange Lounge,

29:30.160 --> 29:31.680
just sitting around having a good time.

29:31.680 --> 29:35.320
So one way we just kind of do that is by talking about our weeks and our days.

29:35.320 --> 29:38.120
So we're going to talk about your week and your day and what's been up

29:38.120 --> 29:38.800
and what's been going on.

29:38.800 --> 29:42.800
We'll start off tonight with DDR Angel, if you wouldn't mind starting us off. How was your week? How was your day?

29:42.800 --> 29:54.800
Sure, that's not a problem. Yeah. Well, the week was alright. I spent Monday and Tuesday kind of trying to get my computer back online and stuff like that.

29:54.800 --> 30:05.280
like that. I finally got to that point at early Wednesday morning before class and so

30:05.280 --> 30:12.480
that's all fine and good now and I can finally play all the games that I want to play. Today

30:12.480 --> 30:17.980
was pretty much spent catching up on all the Warcraft because I hadn't done it all week

30:17.980 --> 30:24.400
thanks to said computer. Other than that I picked up EX2 this week. I haven't gotten

30:24.400 --> 30:31.400
to play it yet, but I shall get to that shortly. Other than that, it's been a really quiet

30:32.200 --> 30:38.840
week. Oh, I picked up a... People are going to shoot me for this, but I ended up going

30:38.840 --> 30:45.840
to the bookstore and stumbling upon a Warcraft manga. So I was like...

30:47.840 --> 30:48.840
Nerd! Nerd!

30:48.840 --> 30:51.560
I was like, hey, this is cool. Yeah, yeah, yeah, shut up.

30:51.560 --> 30:59.560
Warcraft manga nerd hey I don't know I said I was like okay I'm mine so let's

30:59.560 --> 31:04.080
see let's see the story let's see the world of war I know this isn't World of

31:04.080 --> 31:09.960
Warcraft this is yeah oh it is I think World of Warcraft the Sunwell trilogy

31:09.960 --> 31:15.320
it's an epic quest to save the world of Azeroth from the forces of the undead

31:15.320 --> 31:21.680
Scourge. Warcraft the Sudwell Trilogy chronicles the adventures of Kalec, a blue

31:21.680 --> 31:27.920
dragon who has taken human form to investigate a mysterious power. And

31:27.920 --> 31:36.900
Anvina, a beautiful young maiden with an enchanting secret. Ooh. And volume number

31:36.900 --> 31:41.980
two will be added in March of 2006. So that's a sex novel then, huh? No, it's not a sex

31:41.980 --> 31:48.980
novel. Oh, okay. Oh, dear. What did I walk into? Oh, wait. Actually, yeah, so I bought

31:49.020 --> 31:55.540
that and he caught in a go. Yeah, I bought all those, too, but you've probably done that.

31:55.540 --> 32:02.540
Oh, go read Tone and Jump. Jeez. Okay. Yeah, well, it's in there. Anyway, yeah, I bought

32:03.980 --> 32:08.700
manga this week. Okay, anyway. It's all good. It's all good. Whatever you're into. What?

32:08.700 --> 32:15.700
My Japanese says cries for, um, books and stuff.

32:15.700 --> 32:18.700
Okay, uh, I don't know.

32:18.700 --> 32:19.700
I guess that's it.

32:19.700 --> 32:20.700
All right.

32:20.700 --> 32:22.700
Uh, Loki, how was your week?

32:22.700 --> 32:24.700
How was your day?

32:24.700 --> 32:27.700
Um, my week was okay.

32:27.700 --> 32:36.700
Um, I played other games and worked on the websites.

32:36.700 --> 32:37.700
That's about it.

32:37.700 --> 32:39.700
I ate steak today.

32:40.700 --> 32:42.700
Steak? What kind of steak?

32:43.700 --> 32:46.700
Just steak at Tahoe Joe's.

32:47.700 --> 32:48.700
How big was this steak?

32:48.700 --> 32:49.700
Six ounces.

32:49.700 --> 32:50.700
Was it a big slab of meat?

32:50.700 --> 32:52.700
No, because we had to do the...

32:52.700 --> 32:56.700
We did the meal thing, so you get appetizers, bread, and soup and stuff.

32:56.700 --> 32:59.700
So it's like, by the time you get to the actual steak, it's like, I'm full.

32:59.700 --> 33:01.700
How do you enjoy your slabs of meat?

33:02.700 --> 33:04.700
Medium. Or medium rare.

33:04.700 --> 33:05.700
Yeah.

33:05.700 --> 33:06.700
Me too.

33:06.700 --> 33:13.700
Anyways, so no, that's pretty much all I did was play The Warriors this week, and I love that game.

33:13.700 --> 33:20.700
There's nothing more fun than a game that starts off with beating up bums, and you know, hitting them with bricks and stuff,

33:20.700 --> 33:25.700
and then they mug somebody by throwing a TV at their head and knocked them down and then stole their money.

33:25.700 --> 33:28.700
That's just, that's great gameplay right there.

33:28.700 --> 33:31.700
So, yep, that's what happened.

33:31.700 --> 33:33.700
Okay, okay.

33:33.700 --> 33:35.700
Well, I guess that's it then.

33:35.700 --> 33:37.700
Exover, how was your week? How was your day?

33:37.700 --> 33:39.700
It was good.

33:39.700 --> 33:41.700
I worked a lot.

33:41.700 --> 33:47.700
I played a lot of World of Warcraft, and I played some Final Fantasy XI.

33:47.700 --> 33:49.700
Addict.

33:49.700 --> 33:55.700
My sister came over yesterday and hung out with me and you, Sky.

33:55.700 --> 33:59.380
and we all, like, hung out and stuff

33:59.380 --> 34:03.260
and ate at Claim Jumper, which is a popular restaurant over here

34:03.260 --> 34:06.580
and today

34:06.580 --> 34:10.860
I kind of have, well actually, you know, this week I've also been preparing for

34:10.860 --> 34:11.500
tomorrow's

34:11.500 --> 34:15.540
show. Listen to it.

34:15.540 --> 34:18.660
Starts tomorrow. What's it called? What time's it on?

34:18.660 --> 34:22.660
The first case of the Monday starts at seven and

34:22.660 --> 34:30.500
PST. PST. Meaning Pacific Standard Time. Not Please Sentel. Not Please Sentel.

34:30.500 --> 34:38.740
So you know, listen and stuff. I'm planning on it lasting for two hours. Who knows, though.

34:38.740 --> 34:44.540
It may last less than that. I'm just planning on it being kind of like a fun, random show.

34:44.540 --> 34:50.500
Start off your week. And I love my intro song. Love it, love it. I can't stop talking about

34:50.500 --> 34:52.500
I'm almost obsessed with it.

34:52.500 --> 34:55.020
So are you going to be sad if no one listens?

34:55.020 --> 34:59.180
Um, no, yes, well possibly.

34:59.180 --> 35:02.300
I figure either way, no matter what, it's got to have higher ratings than Diversion

35:02.300 --> 35:03.300
did.

35:03.300 --> 35:04.300
So...

35:04.300 --> 35:12.140
Well, just listen, give it a chance, be objective, it's not going to be all sex, it'll be more

35:12.140 --> 35:13.140
than that.

35:13.140 --> 35:14.140
Okay.

35:14.140 --> 35:17.740
Although I'd enjoy if you just, you know, take off your pants when you listen to it.

35:17.740 --> 35:18.740
Okay.

35:18.740 --> 35:20.740
PG-13, I'm still PG-13.

35:48.740 --> 35:54.500
remember kids don't drink and drive I didn't and I've been playing a lot of

35:54.500 --> 35:58.620
World of Warcraft myself this week which I know it makes me a huge ass hypocrite

35:58.620 --> 36:04.580
but no I don't go by books okay I don't go by the manga I'm just kidding I'm

36:04.580 --> 36:08.940
kidding it's cool but I've just been you know trying to get into it and seeing

36:08.940 --> 36:14.860
how I like it compared to the other MMOs out there and other than that I haven't

36:14.860 --> 36:19.900
been doing a whole lot of things of interest. I did watch the season premieres of South

36:19.900 --> 36:25.980
Park and Drawn Together, though, which were excellent. We should have listened! We should

36:25.980 --> 36:30.580
have listened! Go around the ends and say, trick or treat, and you, like, get turned

36:30.580 --> 36:35.020
into stuff. I know, I got turned into a ninja. I got turned into a bat. That was kind of

36:35.020 --> 36:39.220
interesting. I got turned into a skeleton. Although, I really think that the Halloween

36:39.220 --> 36:44.300
stuff in World of Warcraft is way better than Final Fantasy XI. Like, it can't stand the

36:44.300 --> 36:47.220
the Final Fantasy XI thing, it just sucked.

36:47.220 --> 36:50.400
I'm going to talk about this on the podcast a little later, but I don't want to compare

36:50.400 --> 36:51.900
Final Fantasy XI and World of Warcraft.

36:51.900 --> 36:52.900
But you know what?

36:52.900 --> 36:56.240
I can compare those two because they're both having Halloween events.

36:56.240 --> 36:57.240
So you know...

36:57.240 --> 36:58.240
Yeah.

36:58.240 --> 36:59.240
Alright.

36:59.240 --> 37:00.240
That's fine.

37:00.240 --> 37:01.240
Alright.

37:01.240 --> 37:02.240
Let's see.

37:02.240 --> 37:05.920
I think what we'll do now is we're going to take a little bit of a break, then we're going

37:05.920 --> 37:09.200
to come back and we're going to talk about some Bahmani news, some things going on in

37:09.200 --> 37:10.200
the Bahmani world.

37:10.200 --> 37:11.560
So, let's see.

37:11.560 --> 37:14.160
What do we want to do this break?

37:14.160 --> 37:19.200
I think we'll do another Captain Jack song, although I think we'll keep it to shorter

37:19.200 --> 37:21.280
versions this time.

37:21.280 --> 37:25.080
And we'll be back after this break with more Orange Lodge Radio.

37:25.080 --> 37:26.360
Don't forget you can call our message line.

37:26.360 --> 37:30.100
We're going to get into the message line in probably about another 30 minutes or so.

37:30.100 --> 37:33.340
So make sure you get all your messages in about Captain Jack.

37:33.340 --> 37:38.120
Area code 9162269067.

37:38.120 --> 37:40.520
Remember it's a three hour show, so keep your messages short.

37:40.520 --> 37:43.360
We can't guarantee we'll get to all the messages as well.

37:43.360 --> 37:48.040
just, you know, give it a call. And we'll be back after this with more Orange

37:48.040 --> 37:55.040
lounge radio.

38:18.040 --> 38:21.040
Now you're the last girl on the run

38:22.040 --> 38:25.040
You feel the best to be the one

38:25.040 --> 38:28.040
Come on and join the journey

38:28.040 --> 38:32.040
This is the journey into time

38:32.040 --> 38:35.040
As all the wheels are turning

38:35.040 --> 38:39.040
Race is on the run

38:39.040 --> 38:41.040
Are you ready?

38:41.040 --> 38:43.040
Ready for the race

38:43.040 --> 38:45.040
Are you ready?

38:46.040 --> 38:47.040
Are you ready?

38:48.040 --> 38:51.040
Ready for the Rex. Are you ready?

38:56.040 --> 38:57.040
Are you ready?

39:02.040 --> 39:04.040
Are you ready?

39:09.040 --> 39:10.040
Are you ready?

39:10.040 --> 39:11.040
Are you ready?

39:13.040 --> 39:14.040
Are you ready?

39:15.040 --> 39:16.040
Ready for the race?

39:16.040 --> 39:17.040
Are you ready?

39:23.040 --> 39:24.040
My generation

39:24.040 --> 39:52.040
I am an inspiration to the whole generation.

39:52.040 --> 40:08.520
I throw your hands up I throw your hands up I throw your hands up get em' up high

40:09.480 --> 40:16.280
I throw your hands up I throw your hands up I throw your hands up get em' up high

40:46.280 --> 40:48.280
I can't believe it, I can't believe it

40:49.280 --> 40:50.280
My generation

40:57.280 --> 40:58.280
And the baby

41:01.280 --> 41:02.280
We watching

41:04.280 --> 41:05.280
And the baby

41:08.280 --> 41:09.280
We watching

41:11.280 --> 41:12.280
And the baby

41:13.280 --> 41:14.280
We never felt the same

41:14.280 --> 41:33.120
We want you, we want you, we want you and the cast is crew

41:33.120 --> 41:39.120
Pray to you, my precious, that you will be treasured by my entomology

41:40.120 --> 41:46.120
Pray me to begin to make you feel no puncture on the world of harmony

41:47.120 --> 41:53.120
Pray to you, that you will fly away from the sin that was brought to your heart to see

41:54.120 --> 42:00.120
Stand up for the peace and open in the presence of the sin that was brought to me

42:30.120 --> 42:37.120
Let's go, let's go, right go pick up, let's go, let's go, right go later

42:45.120 --> 42:53.120
Hey yo, Captain Jack, bring me back to the way we're tracked

42:53.120 --> 42:56.120
Give me a gun and more hands

42:56.120 --> 42:59.120
I wanna be your shooting man

43:59.120 --> 44:17.220
The Orange Lounge Radio!

44:17.220 --> 44:19.700
Back here on Orange Lounge Radio on this episode number 161.

44:19.700 --> 44:23.600
A whole break there of Captain Jack songs from DDR because, of course, Captain Jack

44:23.600 --> 44:27.840
passed this past week, so we're just kind of doing some tributes tonight.

44:27.840 --> 44:31.020
Some songs there that you heard in that break, The Race, that was a song that was in not

44:31.020 --> 44:34.900
only DDR third mix, but also a Beatmania song, kind of a fun song there.

44:34.900 --> 44:41.020
My Generation, which I believe was the first Captain Jack song to be in American DDR, I

44:41.020 --> 44:45.940
think, because that song was in DDR Max, right, so I think that was the first one in American

44:45.940 --> 44:46.940
DDR.

44:46.940 --> 44:50.740
And then In The Navy, which by the way is like my favorite steps of any Captain Jack

44:50.740 --> 44:52.220
song, even though the song's a little cheesy.

44:52.220 --> 44:55.860
I do like the little trance part in the middle and the chick singing.

44:55.860 --> 44:57.540
the song itself was kinda

44:57.540 --> 45:00.560
uh... well i didn't like it when the who did that some of the little those

45:00.560 --> 45:02.880
people that's ours i don't like it when they did originally

45:02.880 --> 45:04.200
this is going to get

45:04.200 --> 45:06.160
uh... but i like it

45:06.160 --> 45:09.520
i liked that i like that version because i have a little middle transport is

45:09.520 --> 45:10.480
kinda cool

45:10.480 --> 45:14.040
uh... and then uh... of course captain jack which is kind of the song that

45:14.040 --> 45:17.440
everybody knows um... the actual song captain jack from third makes

45:17.440 --> 45:19.680
uh... this on the heavy effort in it

45:19.680 --> 45:21.200
i will be a fucking man

45:21.200 --> 45:22.180
one point in there

45:22.180 --> 45:27.620
That's right. He lays down the smack there. I will be your fucking man!

45:27.620 --> 45:31.060
And of course that song had some crazy ass steps because it was a maniac song.

45:31.060 --> 45:33.080
And that song also appearing in the latest

45:33.080 --> 45:35.520
DDR Home Mix Xtreme 2.

45:35.520 --> 45:38.280
Which, by the way, speaking of DDR Xtreme 2,

45:38.280 --> 45:42.840
our next big fat giveaway will be on next week's live program. It's going to be

45:42.840 --> 45:44.760
something you're going to have to listen live to win.

45:44.760 --> 45:46.300
We are giving away

45:46.300 --> 45:49.800
a copy of Dance Dance Revolution Xtreme 2,

45:49.800 --> 45:51.760
and here's the catch.

45:51.760 --> 45:55.600
Not only is it a copy of DDR Extreme 2, it's a bundle, kids.

45:55.600 --> 45:58.960
It's a bundle pack, which means it has an official Konami

45:58.960 --> 46:01.040
soft pad bundled in with it.

46:01.040 --> 46:03.440
And those things are not easy to get.

46:03.440 --> 46:07.320
So if you want the best soft pad you can get, we're going

46:07.320 --> 46:08.880
to give you a chance to win it next week.

46:08.880 --> 46:10.920
And a copy of DDR Extreme 2 as well.

46:10.920 --> 46:13.160
And more details to come next week.

46:13.160 --> 46:14.320
I don't know what we're going to do.

46:14.320 --> 46:15.960
Maybe we're going to think about that.

46:15.960 --> 46:18.360
We're going to boo about that over this next week.

46:18.360 --> 46:19.440
So it'll be exciting.

46:19.440 --> 46:26.560
so we're gonna give that away. Also, one more thing I want to point out is our

46:26.560 --> 46:29.360
message line. We are taking messages right now if you have something you want to say

46:29.360 --> 46:34.840
about Captain Jack. Air code 9162269067. That's the brand new Orange

46:34.840 --> 46:41.200
Lounge Radio message line. Anyway, let's talk about what else is going on in the

46:41.200 --> 46:46.960
Milmani world this week. We have the new Midihead podcast, although I have to

46:46.960 --> 46:50.720
be honest. I love Midyhead. He's a great guy. He's a lot of fun, and he does a great job,

46:50.720 --> 46:55.840
but that's not a podcast, what he's doing. He is not doing a podcast. He's calling it

46:55.840 --> 47:00.080
a podcast, but it's not a podcast. You know why it's not a podcast? Because the MP3 was

47:00.080 --> 47:06.800
released by itself. It was not part of a RSS feed. An RSS feed is like, I don't know if

47:06.800 --> 47:11.160
you guys ever saw Kevin Pereira's blog. He was doing a podcast for a little while. It

47:11.160 --> 47:15.160
wasn't a podcast. It was MP3s he was offering for download. So I'm not going to call this

47:15.160 --> 47:20.760
thing, a podcast. It's the new Midihead MP3 where he's teasing Ultramix 3. And I'm gonna

47:20.760 --> 47:25.000
be downright honest, I haven't had time to listen to it yet. I listened to part of it.

47:25.000 --> 47:27.440
Did you? What'd you think? What's that came up?

47:27.440 --> 47:33.040
It's just as cool as, you know, most Midihead stuff. Played some more tracks from his new

47:33.040 --> 47:40.340
album, and it was good. And he gave, he let us know what some of the artists are gonna

47:40.340 --> 47:44.160
be on Ultramix 3. Looks like quite a lineup, too.

47:44.160 --> 47:46.920
Yeah, it's got a very interesting lineup in Ultramix 3.

47:46.920 --> 47:53.240
Let's see if I can head on over here to one of the websites here, because honestly,

47:53.240 --> 47:58.000
I've been a little bit disconnected from everything this week, so I haven't really been reading

47:58.000 --> 47:59.000
what's going on.

47:59.000 --> 48:03.560
I did hear, I heard some people bitching in the chat room about Good Charlotte being in

48:03.560 --> 48:07.400
Ultramix 3, so I guess that news came out that Good Charlotte's going to be in there.

48:07.400 --> 48:08.400
Good.

48:08.400 --> 48:09.400
Yeah, I know.

48:09.400 --> 48:17.120
of an interesting edition, to say the least. Of course, they might be giants. I think some

48:17.120 --> 48:22.000
folks in the thread there used screen captures from a screenshot that was released on the

48:22.000 --> 48:25.160
internet to figure out that the they might be giants song we were supposed to be getting

48:25.160 --> 48:29.520
is Istanbul, not Constantinople, which actually makes me sad because I wanted the Tiny Toons

48:29.520 --> 48:34.200
video in it, because that would have been awesome if it was the Tiny Toons music video.

48:34.200 --> 48:39.120
Okay. Don't you remember on Tiny Toons like years ago, they, well of course Tiny Toons

48:39.120 --> 48:43.040
was a badass show to begin with, but like they had an episode where they parodied MTV

48:43.040 --> 48:46.480
and they did their own music videos and they were like two, they might be giant songs,

48:46.480 --> 48:52.280
they did videos too and Istanbul was one of them and then Particle Man was the other one.

48:52.280 --> 48:56.520
Particle Man, Particle Man, doing the, you know what, forget it. Screw you guys.

48:56.520 --> 48:57.520
Right.

48:57.520 --> 48:58.520
Screw you guys.

48:58.520 --> 48:59.520
No, no, keep going.

48:59.520 --> 49:00.920
Screw you guys.

49:00.920 --> 49:12.480
mentioned in the podcast, Moby, Black Eyed Peas, I wonder if it'll be the, what's the,

49:12.480 --> 49:19.580
My Humps or whatever that song is, probably not, My Humps, B-52s, that's pretty awesome,

49:19.580 --> 49:24.080
the B-52s are awesome. I don't know which song it's going to be, but I hope they do

49:24.080 --> 49:29.440
Rome. I liked Rome, but I'm kind of hoping for Rock Lobster a little bit, or Rock Lobster,

49:29.440 --> 49:32.600
we're going to look at the route club and i'll probably do it

49:32.600 --> 49:34.280
it'll probably be love shack

49:34.280 --> 49:35.720
yeah but you know

49:35.720 --> 49:39.280
uh... what else is there was a gap basement jacks that's pretty cool

49:39.280 --> 49:42.960
isn't jack's uh... nowhere facts

49:42.960 --> 49:45.600
the hell we got like talking to you are

49:45.600 --> 49:46.960
interesting

49:46.960 --> 49:49.960
good charlotte black alicia's

49:49.960 --> 49:53.640

49:56.520 --> 50:00.700
there there's a song called black elitist

50:00.700 --> 50:02.340

50:02.340 --> 50:06.400

50:22.800 --> 50:26.800
it's like my space in the form of

50:26.800 --> 50:28.100
it totally is

50:28.100 --> 50:33.300
it totally is all to explain is the uh... myspace mix

50:33.300 --> 50:35.880
that's great

50:35.880 --> 50:39.580
uh...

50:39.580 --> 50:42.220

50:42.220 --> 50:45.180
four thirty to go up to the three sixty or if they're gonna stay on the regular

50:45.180 --> 50:47.140
xbox platform what's gonna happen

50:47.140 --> 50:48.680
should be interesting

50:48.680 --> 50:51.980
Of course we already know a bunch of other songs that are going to be in UltraMix 3 this year.

50:51.980 --> 50:55.680
We have songs such as

50:55.680 --> 50:58.680
Spray doing I Am Gothic.

50:58.680 --> 51:03.180
So that's another, so you got like, so that's kind of another like borderline emo song.

51:03.180 --> 51:06.180
They should have done the Kill With My Car song.

51:06.180 --> 51:07.680
Raise Your Hands by Midihead of course.

51:07.680 --> 51:09.680
Conflict by The Yozoic.

51:09.680 --> 51:12.680
Basil by Orif Is.

51:12.680 --> 51:14.680
Drivin' Naoki featuring Polteri.

51:14.680 --> 51:17.680
And Brilliant R.E.D. which is a brand new Naoki song.

51:17.680 --> 51:21.040
which one of the screenshots gave away that was posted by another website.

51:21.040 --> 51:25.240
Love This Feelin', the Zonk remix by Akiriyama Oka,

51:25.240 --> 51:29.280
the remix by Zonk. And then of course the Jelly Hit, Jelly Head.

51:29.280 --> 51:32.640
Jelly Kiss, Midi Head, Smack Mix with Togo Project featuring Sana.

51:32.640 --> 51:36.360
Hash the Sun by Shatonix, which was on the V-Rare.

51:36.360 --> 51:39.440
A Remix of Colors by Midi Head.

51:39.440 --> 51:43.120
A Remix of Bailalaki, I Carried with the Wind by Jondi and Spesh.

51:43.120 --> 51:46.960
Come With Me by Raindancer, which I believe is a

51:46.960 --> 51:52.360
different drum crossover or something related I think and together and

51:52.360 --> 51:55.860
forever by Captain Jack which I think is pretty cool so we do get a Captain Jack

51:55.860 --> 52:01.000
song in Ultramix 3 pretty appropriate at this point so that's what's going on

52:01.000 --> 52:08.920
with Ultramix 3 should be an interesting mix all right I think what

52:08.920 --> 52:13.060
we'll do now why don't we go ahead and let's let's um go over to the Orange

52:13.060 --> 52:16.540
Launch Radio message line and let's see what we got on our messages and then

52:16.540 --> 52:19.980
we'll actually open up the Skype line in a little bit to take calls and when we

52:19.980 --> 52:23.540
open up the Skype line to take live calls you can either call us over the

52:23.540 --> 52:27.340
Skype line like you always do in the past or you can just get on the phone

52:27.340 --> 52:30.460
and punch in the digits. So we're gonna load up and see what messages we got on

52:30.460 --> 52:35.740
the Skype line. We wanted to see what people had to say about us. And of course

52:35.740 --> 52:39.340
this is a brand new thing kind of for us is this whole thing so this is very

52:39.340 --> 52:43.900
experimental, so I'm not sure if this is going to work.

52:43.900 --> 52:45.140
So we'll find out.

52:45.140 --> 52:47.460
But we're cutting edge here on Orange Line Radio.

52:47.460 --> 52:47.980
So why not?

52:47.980 --> 52:49.700
We're going to go check out what kind of

52:49.700 --> 52:51.220
voicemails we got.

52:51.220 --> 52:54.820
And play some messages, see what you guys have to say.

52:54.820 --> 52:56.060
So let's go ahead.

52:56.060 --> 52:58.120
And we're not taking live calls right now at this

52:58.120 --> 53:01.260
moment, we are simply taking the calls over

53:01.260 --> 53:02.920
on the message line.

53:02.920 --> 53:07.700
So let's listen to some voicemails that we got.

53:07.700 --> 53:09.300
eat your webmaster

53:09.300 --> 53:10.900
I like it

53:10.900 --> 53:11.860
ha ha ha

53:11.860 --> 53:15.200
whoops I think that was a test call

53:15.200 --> 53:18.860
let's try this one instead

53:18.860 --> 53:20.700
Yea what's up it's Sam

53:20.700 --> 53:21.880
I mean

53:21.880 --> 53:24.640
I don't know this whole thing about Captain Jack is

53:24.640 --> 53:26.100
pretty crappy

53:26.100 --> 53:28.140
I mean I love the songs

53:28.140 --> 53:31.860
good times on third mix playing Captain Jack on the standard

53:31.860 --> 53:33.700
oh those were good times but

53:33.700 --> 53:35.800
y'know it's terrible a guy like that has to

53:35.800 --> 53:37.540
pass away so

53:37.540 --> 53:46.900
I don't know, it just sucks, but Captain Jack lives on in our hearts.

53:46.900 --> 53:52.860
And did you also know Captain Jack, I was looking at pictures, he's a freaking pimp.

53:52.860 --> 53:58.980
Captain Jack is the master pimp, he had so many ladies, it was just awesome.

53:58.980 --> 54:05.980
but it sucks about Captain Jack.

54:28.980 --> 54:36.980
Just sitting here in my room, attending Maniac 64, just testing out this new golf thingy.

54:36.980 --> 54:40.980
Pants are out in the living room and just back in my room.

54:40.980 --> 54:45.980
I'm supposed to be doing homework, but you know what? Screw you, homework! Screw you!

54:45.980 --> 54:53.980
Yeah, it really grinds my gears, like America does to Peter Griffin.

54:53.980 --> 54:58.980
I'm thinking about getting Doritos and stuff. Doritos are good, especially the ranch flavor.

54:58.980 --> 55:00.980
I'm just watching a movie that-

55:00.980 --> 55:01.980
Are you high?

55:01.980 --> 55:02.980
Funny feeling.

55:02.980 --> 55:03.980
Is this guy high?

55:03.980 --> 55:04.980
No, I don't think so.

55:04.980 --> 55:05.980
Alright.

55:05.980 --> 55:08.980
Yeah, I'm just like, jabbering.

55:08.980 --> 55:15.980
So yeah, Loki, I know what you did with my foot last night. I don't know what the heck was going on in that sick mind of yours.

55:15.980 --> 55:23.980
And go to gamersadvanced.com because they have openings for like, reviewer people and stuff.

55:23.980 --> 55:31.980
Yeah, gamersadvanced.com with a D at the end of advance, okay?

55:31.980 --> 55:35.980
Games.com? Yeah, it's.com.

55:35.980 --> 55:42.980
Come on to the... there, or else the scrolls of like, evil chocolate will take you away to the funny farm.

55:42.980 --> 55:43.980
Our life is good.

55:43.980 --> 55:48.980
Yeah, just crazy random. Okay, so, like, bye. Hope you're quiet.

55:50.980 --> 55:55.980
I think he was high. He was something.

55:55.980 --> 56:01.980
I think he was so high he forgot to mention Captain Jack in his minute. No, it's fine. I'm just teasing.

56:01.980 --> 56:03.980
Doritos? I do agree with the Doritos.

56:03.980 --> 56:05.980
Doritos are the shit, though. Doritos are awesome.

56:05.980 --> 56:10.980
Branch Doritos are good, but you know what? Nothing beats the original. They're the cheesiest.

56:10.980 --> 56:12.980
Well, the cheesiest is Cheetos, right?

56:12.980 --> 56:14.980
I think so.

56:14.980 --> 56:16.980
They're the cheesiest to me in my book.

56:16.980 --> 56:19.980
Our listeners are kind of sedated tonight. I don't know what's going on.

56:19.980 --> 56:21.980
I don't know what's going on.

56:21.980 --> 56:23.980
Did you guys like put on a fire or something?

56:23.980 --> 56:25.980
Like shut all the windows or something?

56:28.980 --> 56:30.980
Let's go to another message.

56:30.980 --> 56:32.980
Greetings Orange Lounge Radio.

56:32.980 --> 56:36.980
This is L. Mullet with my thoughts on the passing of Captain Jack.

56:36.980 --> 56:39.980
I really like Captain Jack's music.

56:39.980 --> 56:46.380
played it ever since uh the second remix home version when two of his songs were used as preview

56:46.380 --> 56:53.660
tracks and i remember captain jack fondly he had some of my favorite songs and i remember him

56:53.660 --> 56:58.940
especially fondly because captain jack grand ballet mix was the first catastrophic level

56:58.940 --> 57:05.900
song that i have ever passed which is really odd considering this step chart is incredibly

57:05.900 --> 57:09.860
difficult to begin with.

57:09.860 --> 57:16.980
And also, Dream of Dream was the first heavy song at Seven Stars that I ever triple-A'd.

57:16.980 --> 57:22.020
In any case, Captain Jack was very fun, not only to listen to, but to look at through

57:22.020 --> 57:23.620
his music videos.

57:23.620 --> 57:27.980
If you wanted to know where all the white women were at, there they were.

57:27.980 --> 57:34.020
And in any case, I will remember him with the greatest of memories, as it were, for

57:34.020 --> 57:38.940
lack of better words than embarrassing myself on your new message line and it's

57:38.940 --> 57:45.540
okay everybody else's I shall be playing his songs in memorance and thank you for

57:45.540 --> 57:49.380
allowing me this forum to talk about Captain Jack thank you very much

57:49.380 --> 57:55.340
everyone and goodbye where the white women gonna hang out now now the

57:55.340 --> 57:59.300
Captain Jack's gone where all the white women gonna go they'll go hang out with

57:59.300 --> 58:00.540
another gangster

58:00.540 --> 58:04.420
i don't know i don't know in germany

58:04.420 --> 58:06.840
wait what message i like that

58:06.840 --> 58:08.460
wasn't from germany

58:08.460 --> 58:12.340
no i don't use from germany but he was big in germany like hasselhoff

58:12.340 --> 58:15.580
uh... was big in germany

58:15.580 --> 58:18.180
baywatch dot d

58:18.180 --> 58:21.260
let's go to another message here on the orange laundry or message line they were

58:21.260 --> 58:24.300
going to open it up for live calls very soon

58:24.300 --> 58:25.180
Hi, Aaron's on.

58:25.180 --> 58:29.300
He's open to his goggles in the chat room.

58:29.300 --> 58:32.740
Dream of Dream was one of the first songs I played in DDR.

58:32.740 --> 58:36.420
And I guess it was always pretty kind of a special place

58:36.420 --> 58:37.660
in my heart.

58:45.180 --> 58:46.940
Oh, and then it hung up.

58:46.940 --> 58:49.740
No, Dream of Dream is one of the awesome DDR songs.

58:49.740 --> 58:51.540
We've got to play that at some point tonight, because Dream

58:51.540 --> 58:55.500
Dream that's one of my favorite DDR songs as well didn't I play that like

58:55.500 --> 59:01.820
when my first came up here and on like episode 37 or something and we went to

59:01.820 --> 59:06.140
like Stockton and like they had like a fourth mix there or something and I

59:06.140 --> 59:11.660
played it there possibly Dream of Dreams debut was on fourth mix and it's got a

59:11.660 --> 59:14.620
really you know the riff is from Hall of the Mountain King which is you know one

59:14.620 --> 59:19.540
of the you know doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo like classic songs I I do seem

59:19.540 --> 59:24.300
to recall that we went out and played like fourth or fifth mix and probably that song

59:24.300 --> 59:28.780
came up because it's an easy as hell seven-footer, but when I say easy, I mean fun. Like it was

59:28.780 --> 59:33.220
like a very constant, you know, you can know the steps and a lot of people have fun with

59:33.220 --> 59:37.260
it. If you're going to AAA heavy songs, Dream of Dreams is a good one to start off with.

59:37.260 --> 59:41.540
What are you talking about? I still can't follow heavy arrows anyway.

59:41.540 --> 59:46.300
Well, you know, it's a good song to warm up to. It's a good song to warm up to. All right,

59:46.300 --> 59:50.300
We got one more message on the message line. Let's go to it.

59:50.300 --> 59:54.300
This is Illusion.

59:54.300 --> 59:58.300
When I found out Captain Jack died, I was surprised, but

59:58.300 --> 01:00:02.300
I didn't think it would affect CDR much, because

01:00:02.300 --> 01:00:06.300
I guess he got all his recordings out of the way.

01:00:06.300 --> 01:00:10.300
But, yeah, I was surprised, and it was a

01:00:10.300 --> 01:00:14.300
sad thing to hear, and I hope his family is doing

01:00:14.300 --> 01:00:21.820
Yeah, of course, Captain Jack, his family, got to be taking this harder than anybody

01:00:21.820 --> 01:00:27.500
in the scene is. Obviously, our thoughts go out to Captain Jack's family and the surviving

01:00:27.500 --> 01:00:33.060
relatives. How many times was Captain Jack married? Only once? I'm not sure. I think

01:00:33.060 --> 01:00:36.220
the lead singer of Captain Jack at one point, I know, I'm looking at extra for like he knows,

01:00:36.220 --> 01:00:39.860
I think the lead singer of Captain Jack at one point was his wife, but there were like

01:00:39.860 --> 01:00:43.620
four different women in Captain Jack at one point different different women I

01:00:43.620 --> 01:00:48.300
think the first one was his wife at some point do you think they were all his

01:00:48.300 --> 01:01:01.580
wives what no never mind okay he was in more women than they were oh shit all

01:01:01.580 --> 01:01:05.980
right on that note let's go Skype I will take your calls on anything anything you

01:01:05.980 --> 01:01:09.380
want to talk about within reason kids you can either call us the old-fashioned

01:01:09.380 --> 01:01:14.260
way by loading up the Skype line, or you can give us a call on the telephone.

01:01:14.260 --> 01:01:18.980
Of course, our brand new telephone number that you can give us a call on, it is area

01:01:18.980 --> 01:01:24.540
code 9162269067, either way you want to do it there.

01:01:24.540 --> 01:01:27.700
But of course, kids, ask your parents' permission before calling because it might be a toll

01:01:27.700 --> 01:01:28.700
charge.

01:01:28.700 --> 01:01:33.100
Kind of interesting, the first experiment there on the Orange Lake message line, I notice

01:01:33.100 --> 01:01:37.100
some people's voices are very, very quiet, where some people are very, very loud.

01:01:37.100 --> 01:01:39.100
Anyway, uh, let's go to a call.

01:01:39.100 --> 01:01:41.100
Hello, Yarnorgen Launch Radio.

01:01:41.100 --> 01:01:43.100
Hi, it's Sephiroth1215.

01:01:43.100 --> 01:01:45.100
Hello, Sephiroth1215, what's on your mind?

01:01:45.100 --> 01:01:49.100
Uh, first of all, yeah, sadly, Captain Jack died.

01:01:49.100 --> 01:01:57.100
I actually had friends over when the news came up, and they really even played EDR, and even they were kinda...awing.

01:01:57.100 --> 01:02:00.100
Because they recognized the pimpness of Captain Jack.

01:02:00.100 --> 01:02:04.100
Surely, that guy had a ton of medals.

01:02:04.100 --> 01:02:06.100
For a reason.

01:02:06.100 --> 01:02:12.340
Anyway, I mean hopefully, I'm sure they would do something in UltraMix 3, but I don't even

01:02:12.340 --> 01:02:13.340
know.

01:02:13.340 --> 01:02:15.820
I don't think there's enough time for them to even put a little tribute in there.

01:02:15.820 --> 01:02:19.980
It would be nice for them to say something like in the manual or something, but seeing

01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:25.220
as the game is probably already on its way to the pressing mill before this news came

01:02:25.220 --> 01:02:29.340
out, I wouldn't expect to see anything in UltraMix 3 regarding this.

01:02:29.340 --> 01:02:33.460
Maybe this time next year when the new DDR games come out, assuming we're getting more

01:02:33.460 --> 01:02:37.200
DDR games next year, but I don't see how we couldn't possibly be.

01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:40.980
Maybe we'll see something in B-Mania, although I don't know about that, and the only way

01:02:40.980 --> 01:02:44.640
I guess maybe we'd get that is if the race showed up as one of the five key songs.

01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:47.800
But you never know what might happen over at Konami, so we'll see.

01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:52.960
Now we might see something in DDR Strike, the Japanese DDR, because that still isn't

01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:56.200
going to be coming out until early 2006, as far as we know.

01:02:56.200 --> 01:02:59.540
So they have plenty of time to do something for Captain Jack if they want over there.

01:02:59.540 --> 01:03:00.540
So we'll see.

01:03:00.540 --> 01:03:07.540
Yeah, yeah, hopefully they will, but on the same note, I mean, I got to play the demo

01:03:07.540 --> 01:03:14.540
of UltraMix 3, which, I mean, it, the demo actually was kind of broken, well, maybe it

01:03:14.540 --> 01:03:20.460
was just a disk, but it froze up a lot for me, but otherwise it played just the same

01:03:20.460 --> 01:03:23.940
as UltraMix 2, except for the bubbles, and that's it.

01:03:23.940 --> 01:03:27.760
You know, from what I remember at E3, the game did play just like UltraMix 2 with maybe

01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:31.800
some minor differences so I don't know but then again Ultramix 2 is one of the

01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:35.440
better Bomani games they put out ever at the home so if it ain't broke don't fix

01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:39.920
it right oh yeah yeah I'm sure it'd be fine it was just a demo test they got

01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:49.320
yeah otherwise I saw an ad for it and I believe it even said in the in the chat

01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:55.880
room that run DMC is going to be in there with walk this way really yeah

01:03:55.880 --> 01:03:59.880
Where did we hear that? Was that on the podcast or something? I might have missed it.

01:03:59.880 --> 01:04:06.880
No, it was just in the chatroom before, and they have it advertised in an ad in a magazine.

01:04:06.880 --> 01:04:08.880
They just have the background for it.

01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:09.880
Wow.

01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:15.880
It was based on, like, they saw, there's a screenshot of a movie which looks like, you know, from the video.

01:04:15.880 --> 01:04:23.880
Interesting. Well, that would be a very interesting, I mean, obviously this is looking like one of the more diverse mixes we've gotten, so something like that wouldn't surprise me at all.

01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:28.880
Well, Mitty had said that 80% of the music that was going to be in UltraMix 3 is going to be new to DDR.

01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:31.880
Good! Good news.

01:04:31.880 --> 01:04:36.880
If you want the Japanese crossovers, go play Xtreme 2, or go buy a Japanese PlayStation.

01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:46.880
Also, the ad said that there's a new website called MusicInEveryDirection.com.

01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:49.880
I went to it today, but it's not even up yet.

01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:53.240
and it also says coming soon to mobile

01:04:53.240 --> 01:04:57.240
what DDR? yeah that's kinda weird

01:04:57.240 --> 01:05:02.240
okay well it wouldn't surprise me I guess I mean they'd pump it up on mobile

01:05:02.240 --> 01:05:03.480
overseas so

01:05:03.480 --> 01:05:06.920
and you know what yeah Konami's been doing the mobile thing because I downloaded

01:05:06.920 --> 01:05:09.280
Castlevania on a mobile phone which by the way sucked

01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:12.360
but it was there and it was on a mobile phone

01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:15.760
so it wouldn't surprise me if DDR shows up on mobile but

01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:19.160
I don't really get the point because you can't dance but

01:05:19.160 --> 01:05:21.580
whatever

01:05:21.580 --> 01:05:23.680
yeah yeah whatever i guess

01:05:23.680 --> 01:05:25.480
right on

01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:26.320
otherwise

01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:29.660
the demo also has a demo of castlevania

01:05:29.660 --> 01:05:33.200
but i got really pissed off because that's the one demo that absolutely would not work on

01:05:33.200 --> 01:05:34.760
there really

01:05:34.760 --> 01:05:37.500
yeah oh i've got it i want to check out the castlevania demo though but it

01:05:37.500 --> 01:05:40.980
doesn't work how does that how did that get by QA

01:05:40.980 --> 01:05:42.760
it says there's

01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:44.380
that it's not able to read disk

01:05:44.380 --> 01:05:46.180
every time i try and do it

01:05:46.180 --> 01:05:47.880
very interesting

01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:50.060
The merit's coming out in two weeks anyways.

01:05:50.060 --> 01:05:52.960
Yeah, but we want to play a free demo.

01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:54.600
Whatever.

01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:57.220
Free stuff rocks, I know.

01:05:57.220 --> 01:06:02.360
Speaking of free stuff, Toys R Us now has a deal going on this week.

01:06:02.360 --> 01:06:04.520
Or you could buy two

01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:08.680
Xbox, PS2, or GameCube games and you get one free. Any of them.

01:06:08.680 --> 01:06:10.940
Awesome. Buy two, get one free?

01:06:10.940 --> 01:06:15.480
Yeah. Oh man, I just bought two games at Toys R Us last week.

01:06:15.480 --> 01:06:18.680
bastards, they always do that shit after I shop there, oh well.

01:06:18.680 --> 01:06:24.280
That's cool though, hey, I'm gonna have to go check that out. I imagine they're probably trying to clear the shelves to make way for an Xbox 360 setup.

01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:25.540
Uh, but we'll see.

01:06:25.540 --> 01:06:28.040
Uh, maybe.

01:06:28.040 --> 01:06:34.340
Um, otherwise I, I guess that's it for me. Okay, sounds good, thanks for the call, and uh, take care, sub her up, okay?

01:06:34.340 --> 01:06:37.160
Okay, you too.

01:06:37.160 --> 01:06:38.840
Let's go to another call.

01:06:38.840 --> 01:06:42.640
Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's Radio.

01:06:42.640 --> 01:06:46.480
Hello? Hello? Yes. Hello?

01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:51.120
It's Nintendo Maniac 64. How you doing Nintendo Maniac 64?

01:06:51.120 --> 01:06:55.960
By the way, I was not high. I knew that was you that had called in earlier.

01:06:55.960 --> 01:06:59.880
You tell me, though, how we're supposed to not think you're high because, you know,

01:06:59.880 --> 01:07:02.160
you got the Dorito craven going on and you

01:07:02.160 --> 01:07:04.420
you kind of have that voice on your message like,

01:07:04.420 --> 01:07:07.440
Hey guys.

01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:11.800
The phone, excuse me, it's not exactly the loudest thing.

01:07:11.800 --> 01:07:13.000
I'm just messing with you.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.060
I think we have like five bucks on that.

01:07:15.060 --> 01:07:18.960
What is that? There's some noise in the background there that sounds like Christopher's car.

01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:20.240
Like this is...

01:07:20.240 --> 01:07:22.320
Eeeeee!

01:07:22.320 --> 01:07:24.120
This is the laptop's fan.

01:07:24.120 --> 01:07:28.700
Oh, okay. Cause the belt on Christopher's car is about to fall off or something, so every time he starts his car...

01:07:28.700 --> 01:07:31.400
Like if we had a microphone cord that we could run outside,

01:07:31.400 --> 01:07:34.260
we probably wouldn't even need to get it outside, we'd just get it to the door.

01:07:34.260 --> 01:07:38.120
Seriously, every single time I start the car everybody thinks there's a fire going on somewhere.

01:07:38.120 --> 01:07:40.420
I know when Christopher leaves for work in the morning,

01:07:40.420 --> 01:07:42.140
because like he'll turn on his car and then

01:07:42.140 --> 01:07:45.820
like you hear this really loud bell noise that

01:07:45.820 --> 01:07:49.920
I'm sure wakes up all the neighbors. I need to announce when I leave.

01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:52.460
X the fuck has left the building.

01:07:52.460 --> 01:07:54.140
Excuse me.

01:07:54.140 --> 01:07:58.620
Alright. There is a song that actually has like, pardon the lyrics though, like

01:07:58.620 --> 01:08:01.420
let's wake up the neighbors or something.

01:08:01.420 --> 01:08:03.220
I usually play that when you're playing.

01:08:03.220 --> 01:08:04.460
I just

01:08:04.460 --> 01:08:07.780
you know between you and me we kind of live in the ghetto as it is so I don't

01:08:07.780 --> 01:08:13.460

01:12:03.020 --> 01:12:04.540
uh... yeah

01:12:04.540 --> 01:12:05.900
that was a total

01:12:05.900 --> 01:12:07.780
surprise

01:12:07.780 --> 01:12:10.260
yeah it was very sudden because he was so young obviously

01:12:10.260 --> 01:12:12.180
oh yeah

01:12:12.180 --> 01:12:15.460
you know my brother was a big fan of his

01:12:15.460 --> 01:12:18.360
is your brother much of a DDR player?

01:12:18.360 --> 01:12:20.000
yes

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.920
okay

01:12:22.920 --> 01:12:24.580
okay very cool

01:12:24.580 --> 01:12:26.000
uh...

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:29.960
so yeah I was kind of a bummer because it was very sudden and you know everything

01:12:29.960 --> 01:12:34.000
and he kind of died young which is really too bad yeah I know

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.080
it sucks Exeter, it really sucks

01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:41.160
and some people are really hurting Exeter

01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:42.040
anyway

01:12:42.040 --> 01:12:48.560
uh... what else is in your mind d t

01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:52.320
any any cool games you play this week or tells about

01:12:52.320 --> 01:12:56.560
extreme to extreme to how's that going to be a lot of fun job

01:12:56.560 --> 01:12:59.320
i don't know i had to start over right

01:12:59.320 --> 01:13:01.880
prepped over the park orange

01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:06.440
all she said he took over the power car like a good like we have a lot

01:13:06.440 --> 01:13:07.240
Yeah.

01:13:07.240 --> 01:13:11.140
Oh no, that's the worst. Like when the game was saving or something?

01:13:11.140 --> 01:13:12.840
Yeah, when it was

01:13:12.840 --> 01:13:14.440
booting up.

01:13:14.440 --> 01:13:17.600
Oh my god, I'm always afraid that that's going to happen to me,

01:13:17.600 --> 01:13:19.800
like when it says do not pull out the memory card,

01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:23.400
especially on those games that take forever to save to the memory card because the files are so

01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:27.000
huge, like a game like Coldsept or something.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:30.320
When the file's saving, I'm afraid that thunder's going to hit and then turn off my

01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:33.840
PlayStation 2. That would be God's little joke on me,

01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:38.840
Honestly. Hee hee hee, I erased your file. Hee hee hee, 27 hours on the game. Hee hee hee.

01:13:38.840 --> 01:13:41.040
Hee hee, you're going to hell.

01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:45.540
Alright, any other thoughts for us, DT, before we get onto another call?

01:13:45.540 --> 01:13:49.160
No, that's about it. I did unlock a

01:13:49.160 --> 01:13:51.720
Section D on the Dancemaster mode.

01:13:51.720 --> 01:13:53.340
A which song?

01:13:53.340 --> 01:13:57.040
So that's been kicking my ass.

01:13:57.040 --> 01:13:58.700
Okay. So that's pretty much it.

01:13:58.700 --> 01:14:02.020
Alrighty. Thank you for calling. Well, thanks for calling. Oh, yeah.

01:14:02.020 --> 01:14:02.840
Alright. Yep.

01:14:02.840 --> 01:14:03.840
Have a good one.

01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:04.840
Bye.

01:14:04.840 --> 01:14:05.840
Later.

01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:06.840
Yep.

01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:09.600
Our Skype line is screaming popular tonight.

01:14:09.600 --> 01:14:10.600
Let's go to another call.

01:14:10.600 --> 01:14:11.600
Hello?

01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:12.600
You're on Orange Launch Radio.

01:14:12.600 --> 01:14:13.600
Hey.

01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:14.600
This is Dark Knight.

01:14:14.600 --> 01:14:15.600
Hey, Dark Knight.

01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:16.600
What's up?

01:14:16.600 --> 01:14:17.600
Yo, yo.

01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:18.600
Hey, JK.

01:14:18.600 --> 01:14:19.600
Hello, man.

01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:20.600
Hey, what's up?

01:14:20.600 --> 01:14:25.600
I thought I'd just pass along this for you about what I heard about Yahoo maybe trying

01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:27.560
a little DDR themselves.

01:14:27.560 --> 01:14:29.840
Yahoo is getting into DDR?

01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:30.840
Yeah.

01:14:30.840 --> 01:14:39.600
Yeah, apparently they put out, like, a little game from Wild Tangent and something like that, called, like, Dance-O-Matic or Dance Groove or something like that.

01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:47.080
Aw, fuck. Isn't Wild Tangent-Loki, wasn't Wild Tangent the one that did Tap-A-Jam, or am I confusing that with somebody else?

01:14:47.080 --> 01:14:50.000
You remember that Tap-A-Jam, the one that was, like, Beatmania, but it was all, like, classical songs?

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:51.080
Yeah, I think there was.

01:14:51.080 --> 01:14:51.840
Was that them?

01:14:51.840 --> 01:14:54.280
Wild Tangent does something-I think Wild Tangent actually just, like-

01:14:54.280 --> 01:14:57.400
No, Wild Tangent does the shitty AOL games.

01:14:57.400 --> 01:15:04.200
I thought they were just, it was just like some sort of, um, like a script package or something like that.

01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:07.400
Devil work! That's what it is. Devil! Devil stuff!

01:15:07.900 --> 01:15:08.400
No.

01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:11.900
Yeah, anyway, I took a look at this game and everything, right?

01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:18.400
Well, they do, like, bust a groove, but they also have, like, a little DDR mode as well mixed into it.

01:15:19.900 --> 01:15:23.900
So it's... Oh, wait, I think I played... You know what? I think I played a game like this before.

01:15:23.900 --> 01:15:27.900
Yeah, I think I pointed it out like a long time ago on AIM.

01:15:27.900 --> 01:15:29.900
But it wasn't a Yahoo game, it was an AIM game.

01:15:29.900 --> 01:15:33.900
No, yeah, it was an AIM game, but maybe they're like...

01:15:33.900 --> 01:15:34.900
Licensing it out to Yahoo.

01:15:34.900 --> 01:15:35.900
Yeah, exactly.

01:15:35.900 --> 01:15:38.900
Maybe, okay, because that would make sense because if Wild Tangent did the AOL games...

01:15:38.900 --> 01:15:39.900
Right.

01:15:39.900 --> 01:15:42.900
Okay, okay, so this game is about to get a little bit bigger, it looks like.

01:15:42.900 --> 01:15:43.900
Oh, brother.

01:15:43.900 --> 01:15:44.900
Oh, goody, goody, goody.

01:15:44.900 --> 01:15:46.900
Yay.

01:15:46.900 --> 01:15:47.900
It looked weird.

01:15:47.900 --> 01:15:50.900
I was like, wait, man, this is like Busted Groove.

01:15:50.900 --> 01:15:52.900
Wait, man, it looks like CDR.

01:15:52.900 --> 01:15:56.900
I suppose imitation is the finest form of flattery?

01:15:56.900 --> 01:16:00.900
Very much. I mean, with the gallon there, the only problem is that

01:16:00.900 --> 01:16:04.900
if you have a slow computer, of course the timing will be atrocious.

01:16:04.900 --> 01:16:08.900
Oh, yeah. I remember, I seem to recall that, was that it was a very

01:16:08.900 --> 01:16:12.900
slow game. Like, even on my computer, which is kind of, you know, it's nice,

01:16:12.900 --> 01:16:16.900
it was kind of the slow running game. Not a very optimized game.

01:16:16.900 --> 01:16:20.900
Yeah. But here's another weird story.

01:16:20.900 --> 01:16:27.100
McDonald's might be, McDonald's will let Nintendo DS owners play their Wi-Fi servers.

01:16:27.100 --> 01:16:31.940
I heard about this, the Wi-Fi at McDonald's. I mean, when I think about, here, let me think

01:16:31.940 --> 01:16:40.700
about places I want to go play my DS. I don't think, oh, McD's. McDonald's was cool for

01:16:40.700 --> 01:16:44.300
social gatherings when I was six years old and some kid would have their birthday party

01:16:44.300 --> 01:16:47.700
there because their parents were poor and couldn't afford anything but a McDonald's

01:16:47.700 --> 01:16:48.700
birthday party?

01:16:48.700 --> 01:16:49.700
Exactly.

01:16:49.700 --> 01:16:50.700
It's funny though.

01:16:50.700 --> 01:16:57.420
It was like you get to be there and you have a Big Mac, an order of fries, and a Wi-Fi

01:16:57.420 --> 01:16:58.420
connection.

01:16:58.420 --> 01:17:01.500
Would you like to supersize your Wi-Fi?

01:17:01.500 --> 01:17:03.380
Yes, I would.

01:17:03.380 --> 01:17:05.460
Wow, that's going to be interesting.

01:17:05.460 --> 01:17:08.180
So McDonald's is going to become the DS hotspot.

01:17:08.180 --> 01:17:09.740
I believe I read that on Slashdot.

01:17:09.740 --> 01:17:12.500
Yeah, I read that somewhere on the internet this week.

01:17:12.500 --> 01:17:13.500
It's interesting.

01:17:13.500 --> 01:17:16.540
I mean, it's weird how they send this all up.

01:17:16.540 --> 01:17:22.540
Nintendo DS Wi-Fi opened up to everybody in the U.S. How about McDonald's now?

01:17:46.540 --> 01:17:51.980
they built the cabinet for, you know, it had like a TV and a Nintendo 64 and stuff, so

01:17:51.980 --> 01:17:52.980
you're right.

01:17:52.980 --> 01:18:00.220
But one time, somebody said a Burger King had a DDR machine or something like that.

01:18:00.220 --> 01:18:01.220
You know what?

01:18:01.220 --> 01:18:02.220
Nothing surprises me.

01:18:02.220 --> 01:18:03.220
Franchise owners can get away with a lot.

01:18:03.220 --> 01:18:04.220
Yeah.

01:18:04.220 --> 01:18:07.180
I figured McDonald's might get it first, but they did do like a little commercial with

01:18:07.180 --> 01:18:08.180
it.

01:18:08.180 --> 01:18:09.180
We'll see what happens.

01:18:09.180 --> 01:18:10.180
It'll be interesting.

01:18:10.180 --> 01:18:11.780
I'm curious to see what happens with the Nintendo Wi-Fi.

01:18:11.780 --> 01:18:14.900
Because, you know, McDonald's has tried to do the social gathering thing before, but

01:18:14.900 --> 01:18:18.260
more of a kid-oriented audience, but it's things like, okay, remember when they released

01:18:18.260 --> 01:18:20.980
those 101 Dalmatian toys in the Happy Meals?

01:18:20.980 --> 01:18:21.980
Yes.

01:18:21.980 --> 01:18:22.980
Yeah.

01:18:22.980 --> 01:18:24.940
And they would have like Tuesday trade night or whatever?

01:18:24.940 --> 01:18:29.740
And sure, it was a bunch of little kids, but do you know who was really trading that stuff?

01:18:29.740 --> 01:18:31.020
Their parents.

01:18:31.020 --> 01:18:33.020
Their parents were trading those 101 Dalmatians.

01:18:33.020 --> 01:18:35.060
It wasn't the kids, it was the damn parents.

01:18:35.060 --> 01:18:36.060
Beanie Babies.

01:18:36.060 --> 01:18:37.060
That's right.

01:18:37.060 --> 01:18:38.060
Beanie Babies.

01:18:38.060 --> 01:18:39.060
Beanie Babies.

01:18:39.060 --> 01:18:40.060
Oh, yeah.

01:18:40.060 --> 01:18:41.060
The McDonald's Beanie Babies.

01:18:41.060 --> 01:18:42.060
Good God.

01:18:42.060 --> 01:18:43.060
I used to work at McDonald's.

01:18:43.060 --> 01:18:44.060
You used to work at McDonald's during that time, right?

01:18:44.060 --> 01:18:48.760
all of them. Who would show up more at those Beanie Baby exchange nights, kids or the parents?

01:18:48.760 --> 01:18:51.660
Soccer balls. Soccer balls.

01:18:51.660 --> 01:18:54.660
Awesome.

01:18:54.660 --> 01:18:58.820
That's all the news I got for you tonight. I should have some more in the coming weeks, but right now

01:18:58.820 --> 01:19:00.100
those are like the two

01:19:00.100 --> 01:19:05.460
major ones that are coming up. Hey, we appreciate you contributing positively to the show

01:19:05.460 --> 01:19:06.020
unlike

01:19:06.020 --> 01:19:09.020
Extover.

01:19:09.020 --> 01:19:12.220
Bye, T.K.

01:19:12.220 --> 01:19:16.280
i'd like that i have a good one

01:19:16.280 --> 01:19:17.960
sorry extra for

01:19:17.960 --> 01:19:21.460
that uh...

01:19:21.460 --> 01:19:22.860
total silence

01:19:22.860 --> 01:19:25.200
so that i call we don't have lighten up on them

01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:28.140
or don't want to know that i don't want to know

01:19:28.140 --> 01:19:30.760
you know

01:19:30.760 --> 01:19:32.880
uh... hello

01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:35.800
that i would like

01:19:35.800 --> 01:19:40.640
well that kind of sad when i discovered captain jack was dead because the

01:19:40.640 --> 01:19:45.640
The first time I played his song was Captain Jack 3rd Mix Grondale.

01:19:45.640 --> 01:19:48.640
A lot of people's first songs?

01:19:48.640 --> 01:19:49.640
Huh?

01:19:49.640 --> 01:19:52.640
A lot of people's first Captain Jack song, definitely.

01:19:52.640 --> 01:19:55.640
Yeah, and I just really liked the song.

01:19:55.640 --> 01:20:01.640
And I liked it even better when I heard the full version because I just thought it was awesome.

01:20:01.640 --> 01:20:05.640
And I was just wondering, could you please get Captain Jack Little Boy on there?

01:20:05.640 --> 01:20:09.640
We will work in Captain Jack Little Boy on our next break, absolutely.

01:20:09.640 --> 01:20:10.640
Bye.

01:20:10.640 --> 01:20:11.640
Alright.

01:20:11.640 --> 01:20:16.520
That was a pretty quick request there.

01:20:16.520 --> 01:20:17.520
Play Little Boy.

01:20:17.520 --> 01:20:18.520
Click.

01:20:18.520 --> 01:20:19.520
We're fine.

01:20:19.520 --> 01:20:23.000
Even if you're going to hang up and ditch, maybe I won't play it.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:24.480
He just called ditched us.

01:20:24.480 --> 01:20:26.160
He totally just called ditched us.

01:20:26.160 --> 01:20:27.160
That's right.

01:20:27.160 --> 01:20:28.160
We've been ditched.

01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:31.720
I know this guy things new.

01:20:31.720 --> 01:20:35.320
I'm surprised we don't get crank calls more on this program.

01:20:35.320 --> 01:20:36.320
Because we have...

01:20:36.320 --> 01:20:37.320
Don't say that.

01:20:37.320 --> 01:20:38.720
People are actually going to do it now.

01:20:38.720 --> 01:20:41.800
I scared them already because I told them we have ways of finding out who they are.

01:20:41.800 --> 01:20:45.120
Hey, if you want to listen to my show tomorrow,

01:20:45.120 --> 01:20:48.120
you can call Ditch Me. It's cool.

01:20:48.120 --> 01:20:51.320
Alright, let's go to another call. Let's go to another call.

01:20:51.320 --> 01:20:54.600
Hi, you're on Orange House Radio. Hey. Hi.

01:20:54.600 --> 01:20:59.480
Is it actually working this time? It is actually working, I hear you loud and clear.

01:20:59.480 --> 01:21:03.240
Who is this? This is Roz. Hi Roz, what's on your mind?

01:21:03.240 --> 01:21:06.800
Um, not too much.

01:21:06.800 --> 01:21:11.800
I just got home from a fun experience.

01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:16.800
Ooh, fun experience, huh? Tell us more about it.

01:21:16.800 --> 01:21:21.800
Yeah, I sat in church for an hour watching the bishop of the diocese say the rosary

01:21:21.800 --> 01:21:26.800
and sitting next to an old lady who wouldn't stop clearing her throat.

01:21:26.800 --> 01:21:31.800
You have a very strange definition of fun experience.

01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:33.800
Okay, there you go. Thank you.

01:21:33.800 --> 01:21:37.800
Don't lie to us. Don't lie to us. That was not a fun experience.

01:21:37.800 --> 01:21:42.800
That was a, um, I think I want to crawl under the pew experience.

01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:47.800
Yeah, yeah. Afterwards, I ran into the house and took a shower.

01:21:47.800 --> 01:21:49.800
So, I'm good.

01:21:52.800 --> 01:21:54.800
Loki sitting in the back there, by the way, going,

01:21:54.800 --> 01:21:55.800
Now we're talking.

01:21:55.800 --> 01:21:57.800
Pervert.

01:21:57.800 --> 01:21:59.800
Oh, yeah. Fantasize.

01:21:59.800 --> 01:22:01.800
Alright.

01:22:01.800 --> 01:22:02.800
I encourage it.

01:22:02.800 --> 01:22:06.800
Now I wonder why I associate with these, um, guys.

01:22:06.800 --> 01:22:08.800
Uh, never mind.

01:22:08.800 --> 01:22:09.800
Oh, come on, you know you like it.

01:22:09.800 --> 01:22:13.800
To our credit, two of us, two of us are gay, you know.

01:22:13.800 --> 01:22:15.800
It's okay, I can hang out with the women.

01:22:15.800 --> 01:22:16.800
It's cool.

01:22:16.800 --> 01:22:17.800
Alright, I like women.

01:22:17.800 --> 01:22:18.800
I like women too.

01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:20.800
They're fun to shop with, anyway.

01:22:20.800 --> 01:22:22.800
And play around with.

01:22:22.800 --> 01:22:24.800
Play around meaning shop with.

01:22:24.800 --> 01:22:25.800
Yeah, yeah.

01:22:25.800 --> 01:22:26.800
God.

01:22:26.800 --> 01:22:28.800
Oh, now he changes it.

01:22:28.800 --> 01:22:31.800
Anyway, let's let our caller talk a little more then.

01:22:31.800 --> 01:22:32.800
Hello caller.

01:22:32.800 --> 01:22:37.680
I'm hitting the chat and like everyone seems horribly surprised that I'm a girl.

01:22:37.680 --> 01:22:38.680
You know what?

01:22:38.680 --> 01:22:41.960
For some reason it's like this big thing like OMG a gamer girl.

01:22:41.960 --> 01:22:46.200
Although like I thought that was like years old now.

01:22:46.200 --> 01:22:48.240
There's plenty of gamer girls out there now.

01:22:48.240 --> 01:22:53.800
Actually when I first walked into that chat room, are you a guy?

01:22:53.800 --> 01:22:54.800
Uh, no.

01:22:54.800 --> 01:22:55.800
Wow.

01:22:55.800 --> 01:22:59.000
Well, there's plenty of girls that play video games of all types now, so...

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.400
And you have a super sounding voice, too.

01:23:03.400 --> 01:23:06.300
I just thought I would say that. Jeez, don't look at me like that, Sky.

01:23:06.300 --> 01:23:10.200
I'm just saying, I'm like, okay, if you want to pay the call, there's a compliment, not a problem.

01:23:10.200 --> 01:23:18.500
It sounds like you would be a good addition to listening to my show starting tomorrow at seven o'clock PST.

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:20.100
He ain't too proud to beg.

01:23:20.100 --> 01:23:26.100
Yeah, I'm all up in the East Coast, so, you know.

01:23:26.100 --> 01:23:28.100
So, like, 10 o'clock?

01:23:28.100 --> 01:23:30.100
She's gotta go to bed by the time your show comes on.

01:23:30.100 --> 01:23:32.100
What do you have going on in the morning on Tuesday?

01:23:32.100 --> 01:23:36.100
You know what? Stop berating the listeners, Extover. Stop it.

01:23:36.100 --> 01:23:38.100
We need to talk serious here for a minute.

01:23:38.100 --> 01:23:40.100
It's after primetime programming.

01:23:40.100 --> 01:23:43.100
Extover, I will take your mic away.

01:23:43.100 --> 01:23:46.100
Roz, I need to know your thoughts on Captain Jack.

01:23:46.100 --> 01:23:56.100
You know, I had no idea until after I got home from the church and being coughed on by that old lady.

01:23:56.100 --> 01:24:03.100
I came back, I checked the site, and I was like, holy shit, because I had no idea.

01:24:03.100 --> 01:24:09.100
That was pretty much my reaction when I found that too, I was like, wow, that was kinda sudden.

01:24:09.100 --> 01:24:12.100
Yeah, it's Captain Jack, that can't happen.

01:24:12.100 --> 01:24:13.100
I know.

01:24:13.100 --> 01:24:14.100
Captain Jack can't die.

01:24:14.100 --> 01:24:15.100
I know.

01:24:15.100 --> 01:24:22.500
Captain Jack I know but yeah I don't know it's it's too bad I don't know what

01:24:22.500 --> 01:24:27.260
else yeah it really is okay Ross well thanks for the call and we're gonna get

01:24:27.260 --> 01:24:29.900
let you go so we get to some more calls because our line is lighting up tonight

01:24:29.900 --> 01:24:33.780
but thanks thanks for calling and they have a good I'm glad it worked this time

01:24:33.780 --> 01:24:39.820
absolutely I'm glad to I'm glad to hear it all right take care Ross bye bye

01:24:39.820 --> 01:24:44.820
Let's go to another call. One more, at least. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

01:24:44.820 --> 01:24:51.820
Hey, this is GS-191 in the chat rooms. Hello, GS-191 in the chat rooms. What's up?

01:24:51.820 --> 01:24:58.820
Not much. I just heard about Captain Jack just now, so I'm very, very shocked.

01:24:58.820 --> 01:25:02.820
Amazing that people actually get their news from our show. I always thought that we were

01:25:02.820 --> 01:25:07.820
the redundancy of the Internet, but no, that's interesting. But yeah, I'm sorry you had to

01:25:07.820 --> 01:25:13.180
had to find out through our show. But what do you think? I mean, it's kind of sudden,

01:25:13.180 --> 01:25:14.180
huh?

01:25:14.180 --> 01:25:19.340
Yeah, I remember back in the really, really old days of, like, the third mix, Korean version

01:25:19.340 --> 01:25:20.340
2.

01:25:20.340 --> 01:25:22.540
Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

01:25:22.540 --> 01:25:23.540
I did not...

01:25:23.540 --> 01:25:24.540
Shit.

01:25:24.540 --> 01:25:28.100
Yeah, you could tell it's the first time.

01:25:28.100 --> 01:25:31.860
It's all right. You know what? It's just Internet radio. No one expects anything.

01:25:31.860 --> 01:25:32.860
Yeah.

01:25:32.860 --> 01:25:33.860
It's all good, man.

01:25:33.860 --> 01:25:37.500
Look, if we can get a show, anything happens.

01:25:37.500 --> 01:25:40.960
Yeah, if Xtoper can get a show, anything goes on the internet.

01:25:40.960 --> 01:25:41.460
So feel safe.

01:25:41.460 --> 01:25:42.180
Say anything.

01:25:42.180 --> 01:25:42.780
Just relax.

01:25:42.780 --> 01:25:43.780
Anything.

01:25:43.780 --> 01:25:45.740
Yeah.

01:25:45.740 --> 01:25:47.760
I remember playing the race on Third Mix,

01:25:47.760 --> 01:25:50.060
and that was my first Captain Jack song.

01:25:50.060 --> 01:25:51.340
And I loved it.

01:25:51.340 --> 01:25:55.900
And when I got home, I frantically

01:25:55.900 --> 01:25:59.220
tried to search for the long version, found it, and put it

01:25:59.220 --> 01:26:02.500
on repeat in my CD player for a long, long time.

01:26:02.500 --> 01:26:05.780
That's what a lot of people do with DDR music when they first play the game, it's like they...

01:26:05.780 --> 01:26:09.620
You know, it's kind of like you can see the life of a DDR noob?

01:26:09.620 --> 01:26:14.380
It's like they play the game, then they find that song they like, then they burn their first DDR CD,

01:26:14.380 --> 01:26:16.860
and they listen to it over and over and over again in the car,

01:26:16.860 --> 01:26:18.580
and then they're playing it to all their friends, like,

01:26:18.580 --> 01:26:20.980
this is this really cheesy DDR music!

01:26:20.980 --> 01:26:22.140
That was me, anyway.

01:26:22.140 --> 01:26:24.980
As Angel turns bright red.

01:26:24.980 --> 01:26:28.540
Because that's what Angel did, too. You know it, you know it, guys.

01:26:28.540 --> 01:26:30.660
because the angel is...

01:26:30.660 --> 01:26:33.620
angel.

01:26:33.620 --> 01:26:38.060
Have you picked up any of the U.S. mixes that have songs in them so you can keep playing them?

01:26:38.060 --> 01:26:40.380
Yeah, I picked up

01:26:40.380 --> 01:26:44.220
EX-2 right after my birthday

01:26:44.220 --> 01:26:47.700
and I've been playing it non-stop.

01:26:47.700 --> 01:26:49.320
It's a great game, it really is.

01:26:49.320 --> 01:26:53.780
Yeah, it's a great day. But I'm looking forward to UltraMix 3, it's going to be a heck of a fall

01:26:53.780 --> 01:26:56.780
with the Bomani releases, I'm very excited.

01:26:56.780 --> 01:27:01.400
oh yeah me too not just captain jack but the whole break if the myspace i'd be

01:27:01.400 --> 01:27:02.200
our mix

01:27:02.200 --> 01:27:05.720
pretty if you have my space makes it can be a fun time

01:27:05.720 --> 01:27:06.560
dot heat

01:27:06.560 --> 01:27:10.780
picture i won't burn in hell i know that there's always going to be one song on

01:27:10.780 --> 01:27:14.340
the next is kinda like uh... it'll to make sure there was like a garage uh...

01:27:14.340 --> 01:27:16.140
i mean seriously who the fuck with us on

01:27:16.140 --> 01:27:19.280
so i want to go to heaven because i mean i'm already going to hell i don't want

01:27:19.280 --> 01:27:21.180
to be

01:27:21.180 --> 01:27:23.180
a good point

01:27:23.180 --> 01:27:27.580
On that note, is there anything else you want to share with our visitors, GS-191?

01:27:27.580 --> 01:27:31.620
Uh, no, not really. It's been great.

01:27:31.620 --> 01:27:33.660
Well, thanks for the call.

01:27:33.660 --> 01:27:37.860
Well, thank you. Alright, and thanks for listening, and uh... call back. Don't be a stranger.

01:27:37.860 --> 01:27:41.000
Alright, sure. Take care. Bye. Later.

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:44.360
One more call? We're just lighting up a call tonight. This is crazy.

01:27:44.360 --> 01:27:48.420
Getting this new phone number was probably the best thing we ever did. Hi, you're on Orson's Radio.

01:27:48.420 --> 01:27:53.160
Hey, it's me, the legend, Zaku. Hey, Zaku, what's up?

01:27:53.160 --> 01:27:59.160
Yeah, I finally got through the phone after trying to hammer Skype through my PC.

01:27:59.160 --> 01:28:04.160
Zaku, we've been hammered all night long. It's crazy. What's up?

01:28:04.160 --> 01:28:08.160
Yeah, obviously you want my reaction to Captain Jack's death.

01:28:08.160 --> 01:28:09.160
Sure.

01:28:09.160 --> 01:28:20.160
It's a shame. I was pretty much shocked as soon as I came home that night and just found out through DDRFreak.

01:28:20.160 --> 01:28:27.160
I mean, this pretty much hit us quickly, you know.

01:28:27.160 --> 01:28:31.160
All these events happen within a matter of a week.

01:28:31.160 --> 01:28:40.160
Monday, he collapses, and then a few days later, he loses his battle to survive.

01:28:40.160 --> 01:28:44.160
Well, unfortunately, Zaku, it was a second stroke, unfortunately.

01:28:44.160 --> 01:28:48.160
Not that that obviously makes it any better, but strokes are sudden things.

01:28:48.160 --> 01:28:52.400
They're not something you have a chance to prepare for, like certain types of cancer

01:28:52.400 --> 01:28:57.600
and things like that, you know, so it's really unfortunate how it went down.

01:28:57.600 --> 01:28:58.600
I agree.

01:28:58.600 --> 01:29:04.720
I'm putting up a link right now in the chatroom that I managed to find from a threading Bobani

01:29:04.720 --> 01:29:07.040
style about the U.S. version of Beatmania.

01:29:07.040 --> 01:29:09.680
It involves DV games again.

01:29:09.680 --> 01:29:15.120
They managed to get the date right, but the pricing you might want to take a look at.

01:29:15.120 --> 01:29:19.560
Okay, so Zaku posts a link in our chatroom which is available at OrangeLawnRadio.com

01:29:19.560 --> 01:29:25.560
Click on chat and he wants me to take a look at this and check out what's going on on EBGames.com

01:29:25.560 --> 01:29:31.760
Wow! Okay, so they're going to ship BeatMania for the PS2 and it's saying March 1st, 2006

01:29:31.760 --> 01:29:35.120
$49.99 is the price. Oh, that's interesting though because...

01:29:35.120 --> 01:29:36.120
Well, that's double.

01:29:36.120 --> 01:29:41.120
Wait a minute. $49.99 for the game and $49.99 for the bundle?

01:29:41.120 --> 01:29:49.120
Yes, I was saying the same shit too. How could Konami, you know, I thought they were going to charge like 60 or 70 for that game.

01:29:49.120 --> 01:29:57.120
Where they're pretty much gonna, they're pretty much shooting themselves in the foot when they're letting folks get away with a 50 dollar game.

01:30:19.120 --> 01:30:26.720
for January and February. We have about 24 of them. Okay, March, we have two. So, I'm

01:30:26.720 --> 01:30:30.000
going to tell you this much. They don't have any info when it's coming out yet because

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:33.400
we haven't even gotten any info when that's just coming out, let alone other stuff. There's

01:30:33.400 --> 01:30:36.840
stuff getting announced left and right we have no dates for, so it doesn't matter.

01:30:36.840 --> 01:30:40.200
It is an interesting discovery, but I don't think it holds any weight.

01:30:40.200 --> 01:30:43.320
It's just like a date for Halo 3. I mean, no one knows when that's coming out. They

01:30:43.320 --> 01:30:45.200
just put it on there saying, take pre-orders.

01:30:45.200 --> 01:30:46.200
Exactly.

01:30:46.200 --> 01:31:03.200
Besides that, basically by the time I called you last night, Digital Life was over, but I didn't manage to get the results of the last few tournaments.

01:31:03.200 --> 01:31:06.200
What happened with the rest of Digital Life?

01:31:06.200 --> 01:31:13.200
One of the, this cat I know who played DVR managed to win like, he managed to win two

01:31:13.200 --> 01:31:14.200
grand.

01:31:14.200 --> 01:31:17.680
One of the players from within, from within New York City.

01:31:17.680 --> 01:31:18.680
Very cool, congratulations.

01:31:18.680 --> 01:31:25.280
If you had a free New York thread, you would know, you know.

01:31:25.280 --> 01:31:28.760
But so far, I mean, it was a sort of, you know, Sunday was probably the worst day you

01:31:28.760 --> 01:31:32.760
went, and I know people learn their lessons well.

01:31:32.760 --> 01:31:36.280
The only good days are the ones that they hold freestyle in.

01:31:36.280 --> 01:31:38.720
Keep that in mind, folks.

01:31:38.720 --> 01:31:42.120
Well, if I go to Additional Life next year, I'll keep that in mind, that Sunday is not

01:31:42.120 --> 01:31:43.120
the day for me to be there.

01:31:43.120 --> 01:31:45.080
I'll take my flight home on Sunday next year.

01:31:45.080 --> 01:31:48.320
Next year is going to be four days.

01:31:48.320 --> 01:31:52.960
I'm assuming that the first day is going to be a free-play event, and then the next three

01:31:52.960 --> 01:31:55.080
days is going to be the tournament.

01:31:55.080 --> 01:31:57.480
If I go to Additional Life next year, though, it ain't going to be just for the tournament.

01:31:57.480 --> 01:31:58.480
I want to take it all in.

01:31:58.480 --> 01:32:01.440
So, of course I'll go to the tournament, but you know.

01:32:01.440 --> 01:32:02.440
Yeah.

01:32:02.440 --> 01:32:07.440
Now you know, now you know that it's in the middle of October next year.

01:32:07.440 --> 01:32:09.440
And knowing is half the battle.

01:32:09.440 --> 01:32:11.440
Yeah, it's GBI Joe.

01:32:11.440 --> 01:32:13.440
Alright, anything else you want to share with our listeners, Zaku?

01:32:13.440 --> 01:32:16.440
I gotta get some more calls because we've got people hammering us.

01:32:16.440 --> 01:32:18.440
Yeah, that's about it, man.

01:32:18.440 --> 01:32:20.440
I already showed you.

01:32:20.440 --> 01:32:22.440
Well, have a good one. Thanks for the call, Zaku.

01:32:22.440 --> 01:32:23.440
Goodbye.

01:32:23.440 --> 01:32:24.440
Alright.

01:32:24.440 --> 01:32:26.440
Later.

01:32:26.440 --> 01:32:28.440
We gotta get some more calls.

01:32:28.440 --> 01:32:30.440
Hi, you're on Orange House Radio.

01:32:30.440 --> 01:32:32.120
Hey, what's up? It's DJ Rama S.

01:32:32.120 --> 01:32:34.520
Hello, DJ Rama S. What's on your mind?

01:32:34.520 --> 01:32:37.080
Not much. I just wanted to say a couple things about the captain.

01:32:37.080 --> 01:32:40.160
You cosplayed the captain, didn't you?

01:32:40.160 --> 01:32:41.720
No, but I'm planning on it.

01:32:41.720 --> 01:32:44.420
Oh, I thought you said you would cosplay him at one point.

01:32:44.420 --> 01:32:47.820
No, I said I plan to. Hopefully, maybe Captain Con next year.

01:32:47.820 --> 01:32:49.680
My bad, my bad.

01:32:49.680 --> 01:32:53.880
Well, prepare to be surrounded by white women, because that's what happens with Captain Jack.

01:32:53.880 --> 01:32:55.080
So...

01:32:55.080 --> 01:32:57.360
Hey, I love it.

01:32:57.360 --> 01:32:59.520
Which is why he told me on...

01:32:59.520 --> 01:33:03.280

01:33:07.400 --> 01:33:11.680

self actually we have every when he told me i thought it you know i was like

01:33:19.760 --> 01:33:21.600

01:33:25.920 --> 01:33:26.920
Yeah.

01:33:26.920 --> 01:33:27.920
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:33:27.920 --> 01:33:30.320
When he was actually in the hospital and stuff, we didn't know.

01:33:30.320 --> 01:33:31.320
Oh, yeah.

01:33:31.320 --> 01:33:33.800
Well, yeah, because the only site that was really reporting on it was like an obscure...

01:33:33.800 --> 01:33:37.720
Well, it was MSM, but it was in Germany because it was the only country where Captain Jack

01:33:37.720 --> 01:33:42.160
was really charting on the charts, so no other news services picked it up.

01:33:42.160 --> 01:33:43.160
Right.

01:33:43.160 --> 01:33:44.160
Anyway.

01:33:44.160 --> 01:33:45.160
Thank you for telling me.

01:33:45.160 --> 01:33:46.160
Yeah.

01:33:46.160 --> 01:33:47.160
I appreciate that.

01:33:47.160 --> 01:33:48.160
Hey, no problem.

01:33:48.160 --> 01:33:50.040
So anything else you want to share about the whole Captain Jack thing?

01:33:50.040 --> 01:33:52.840
Yeah, a couple of things.

01:33:52.840 --> 01:33:58.280
One thing Captain Jack, it means a lot to me because at an amazement I did a walk on

01:33:58.280 --> 01:34:03.880
his naval Barrett to End the Navy, which is one of my personal favorite songs.

01:34:03.880 --> 01:34:09.880
So it kind of tore my heart a bit to hear that news, so yeah.

01:34:09.880 --> 01:34:10.880
I know.

01:34:10.880 --> 01:34:14.560
It's like one of those things where you don't want to say, oh my gosh, I'm getting depressed

01:34:14.560 --> 01:34:16.760
over a DDR artist passing away.

01:34:16.760 --> 01:34:21.300
But at the same time, it's like, you know, the circumstance and the fact that he was

01:34:21.300 --> 01:34:27.380
just a fun party guy and died at a young age, just kind of makes you go, life sucks. Life

01:34:27.380 --> 01:34:28.380
sucks.

01:34:28.380 --> 01:34:35.160
I was just going to say, everybody that calls in, they have a memory of some song that they've

01:34:35.160 --> 01:34:40.340
heard before, that obviously this guy was a strong presence for you all when you guys

01:34:40.340 --> 01:34:43.180
started getting into DDR, so that is sad.

01:34:43.180 --> 01:34:47.100
Wow, you said something profound on this show.

01:34:47.100 --> 01:34:48.100
I did. I can be profound.

01:34:48.100 --> 01:34:53.060
fuck somebody knows the date and time no you you're absolutely right I think a

01:34:53.060 --> 01:34:58.020
lot of time presses because because Captain Jack is so he's got such a

01:34:58.020 --> 01:35:02.300
strong personality and the songs are very unique like him or not you know a

01:35:02.300 --> 01:35:04.620
Captain Jack song when you hear it because it sounds like somebody's

01:35:04.620 --> 01:35:08.540
parking orders at you and people remember that with DDR and people have

01:35:08.540 --> 01:35:11.860
such fond memories about DDR and playing DDR with their friends kind of like how

01:35:11.860 --> 01:35:14.700
they were saying in the opening of the the show when you know only you

01:35:14.700 --> 01:35:23.700
Everybody would get down and, you know, throw all your hands up, hands up, and everybody would do it, and like, everybody did the same stupid little dance to that, you know, and it's...

01:35:23.700 --> 01:35:29.700
You associate all that, I guess, with Captain Jack, the fact that, you know, those bonding times that you had playing DDR, so...

01:35:29.700 --> 01:35:35.700
Xtavor, you're right.

01:35:35.700 --> 01:35:36.700
Thank you.

01:35:36.700 --> 01:35:37.700
You're welcome.

01:35:37.700 --> 01:35:38.700
Sorry, Ronma, I didn't mean to...

01:35:38.700 --> 01:35:39.700
It's okay.

01:35:39.700 --> 01:35:41.700
Anything else you want to share?

01:35:41.700 --> 01:35:53.700
Yeah, two things before I go. Another reason why Captain Jack needs something to me, I'm going to post this link. Someone YTMND, as Taylor Barrett, and if you click on you here in the Navy.

01:35:53.700 --> 01:35:56.700
I'm afraid to bring that up because YTMND-

01:35:56.700 --> 01:35:58.700
It's a good one. I know a good one, seriously.

01:35:58.700 --> 01:36:03.700
But my computer doesn't like YTMND, so I don't know if I can pull it up, but go, chat room, go for it.

01:36:03.700 --> 01:36:10.700
And right here, standing in front of my computer, I have a can of Budweiser. Crack it one open for the captain.

01:36:10.700 --> 01:36:13.700
Poor a 40 for me!

01:36:13.700 --> 01:36:18.700
Damn, I'm not that ghetto, son!

01:36:18.700 --> 01:36:21.700
I am!

01:36:21.700 --> 01:36:25.700
Oh, if it's like that, you could have a good ol' time at CatDoo!

01:36:25.700 --> 01:36:29.700
Hell yeah, hell yeah. Maybe I should cosplay as the captain.

01:36:29.700 --> 01:36:32.700
Um...no.

01:36:32.700 --> 01:36:36.700
I know some single gay guys.

01:36:36.700 --> 01:36:43.700
Me too. Yeah, but that don't mean nothing. Anyway, I'm gonna let you go before this conversation gets ugly.

01:36:43.700 --> 01:36:47.700
Alright. Alright, have a good one. Peace out. Later. Peace.

01:36:47.700 --> 01:36:53.700
And me surrounded by, uh, hot people. No, I'm just kidding. Anyway, let's get to it.

01:36:53.700 --> 01:36:57.700
One more call. I keep saying that, but I keep saying all these, I keep seeing all these names that have been hammering us.

01:36:57.700 --> 01:37:05.700
We need to shut them off. What? No, I've been, I've been seeing all these names, like, hammering us all night long, and I, I know that people want to say stuff about the captain, so I feel an obligation to get to all these calls.

01:37:05.700 --> 01:37:07.700
So this is the last one for now.

01:37:07.700 --> 01:37:10.700
Hi, you're on Arizona Radio.

01:37:10.700 --> 01:37:12.700
Oh wow, I'm the last one. I feel privileged.

01:37:12.700 --> 01:37:13.700
Our test is J100M.

01:37:13.700 --> 01:37:16.700
Well, I see you've been hammering us for like 30 minutes, so I feel bad for you.

01:37:16.700 --> 01:37:18.700
So I want to know what you threw. What's up?

01:37:18.700 --> 01:37:20.700
Yeah, I'm pretty pathetic.

01:37:20.700 --> 01:37:23.700
It's all good. We appreciate it.

01:37:23.700 --> 01:37:26.700
No, nothing. I just found out the bad news about Captain Jack

01:37:26.700 --> 01:37:29.700
after coming back from seeing Doom.

01:37:29.700 --> 01:37:31.700
So that's two bad things in a row.

01:37:31.700 --> 01:37:38.700
Oh shit, you know things come in threes too, so brace yourself. Well, you're listening to this program, I suppose.

01:37:38.700 --> 01:37:40.700
And warts, who knows?

01:37:45.700 --> 01:37:52.700
Don't have sex in the next 24 hours, because you're bound to catch something. Bad things come in threes, so be careful.

01:37:52.700 --> 01:37:59.700
Well yeah, well I'm about to go play the new Budokai Tenkaichi with my roommate after this.

01:37:59.700 --> 01:38:01.540
gonna blow up your console

01:38:01.540 --> 01:38:06.380
or i'll get raped but

01:38:06.380 --> 01:38:10.660
either way what are your thoughts on captain jack

01:38:10.660 --> 01:38:11.520
uh...

01:38:11.520 --> 01:38:16.420
uh... i'm just disappointed i'm not gonna hear uh... any new songs

01:38:16.420 --> 01:38:20.300
from any any more on any of the new DDRs but

01:38:20.300 --> 01:38:21.260
i don't know

01:38:21.260 --> 01:38:24.500
maybe he's like Tupac and he has like a bunch of songs that haven't been released

01:38:24.500 --> 01:38:26.260
yeah you never know

01:38:26.260 --> 01:38:30.860
maybe still alive somewhere. Maybe the whole damn thing is a conspiracy.

01:38:30.860 --> 01:38:32.660
They'll find him in Mexico.

01:38:32.660 --> 01:38:34.180
Yeah, Mexico,

01:38:34.180 --> 01:38:39.080
Canada. I can see the hate mail coming in right now towards Longoria.

01:38:39.080 --> 01:38:41.580
Anything else on your mind?

01:38:41.580 --> 01:38:43.980
Nope, other than

01:38:43.980 --> 01:38:45.780
Doom was a disappointment.

01:38:45.780 --> 01:38:50.700
Was that first person stuff as stupid as it looked in the preview?

01:38:50.700 --> 01:38:55.520
Well, to tell you the truth, they only really had it for about

01:38:55.520 --> 01:38:59.080
two to five minutes of the uh... the last part of the movie. Really?

01:38:59.080 --> 01:39:06.080
That still seems like a long time. Five minutes is a goddamn long time. I thought it was gonna be, well seriously though, the way that they hyped it up, it was supposed to be like the big thing in the movie.

01:39:06.080 --> 01:39:09.560
Well thank god because that shit looked cheesy.

01:39:09.560 --> 01:39:12.680
It did, but you know... Yeah, it was cheesy.

01:39:12.680 --> 01:39:17.400
And they did not have, somebody in chat, I don't know if it was you or somebody else, I just saw it fly by in the chatroom earlier,

01:39:17.400 --> 01:39:20.220
said that the flying eyeballs are not in the movie.

01:39:20.220 --> 01:39:23.140
Yeah, yeah I said that. That's bullshit.

01:39:23.140 --> 01:39:26.100
I was expecting flaming skulls and

01:39:26.100 --> 01:39:29.460
skeletons with rocket launches on their shoulders.

01:39:29.460 --> 01:39:33.340
I think it was Roger Ebert that said that the best thing in the film was like the

01:39:33.340 --> 01:39:35.260
beginning universal logo.

01:39:35.260 --> 01:39:37.780
Like there was some big thing that they did at the beginning.

01:39:37.780 --> 01:39:42.040
Like was that the best thing in the film?

01:39:42.040 --> 01:39:45.700
No, you know they had a couple of

01:39:45.700 --> 01:39:48.740
subtle things in the movie.

01:39:48.740 --> 01:39:52.340
The best thing about Doom will probably be the trailer for Harry Potter

01:40:22.340 --> 01:40:26.340
We have time. And try not to kill yourself on the way out, Extrofer.

01:40:26.340 --> 01:40:30.340
Alright, anyway, um, let's go to a break. Damn, I need a break.

01:40:30.340 --> 01:40:34.340
And I promised somebody we could hear Little Boy, so we're gonna play that song

01:40:34.340 --> 01:40:38.340
from DDR Max 2, and when we come back

01:40:38.340 --> 01:40:42.340
we will probably get into the cage match and talk about some other stuff as well.

01:40:42.340 --> 01:40:46.340
So, let's go to a break. I know that

01:40:46.340 --> 01:40:50.340
microphone is being awful.

01:40:50.340 --> 01:40:52.840
It was, it was left on for some reason.

01:40:52.840 --> 01:40:57.340
Alright, we're gonna play this, it's the, it's actually the full version of Little Boy.

01:40:57.340 --> 01:40:59.860
play that in a couple other little Captain Jack songs and we'll be back

01:40:59.860 --> 01:41:01.860
after this

01:41:29.860 --> 01:41:47.180
Dream on, dream on, make my day You will find a better way

01:41:47.180 --> 01:41:50.180
Dream on and you'll realize That one day you'll pay the price

01:41:50.180 --> 01:41:53.180
Keep on going till tomorrow You will find there is no tomorrow

01:41:53.180 --> 01:41:57.180
Keep on dreaming of this toy You can use my little boy

01:41:57.180 --> 01:42:04.280
Dream on my list, boy, dream on my list, boy Dream on my list, boy, go out and have some joy

I give honors that you follow

01:42:43.400 --> 01:42:44.880
Come with me until tomorrow

01:42:44.880 --> 01:42:46.600
I'm your captain and your jaw

01:42:46.600 --> 01:42:48.200
You can use my little boy

01:42:49.100 --> 01:42:50.560
Dream of my little boy

01:42:50.580 --> 01:42:52.180
Dream of my little boy

01:42:52.200 --> 01:42:53.840
Dream of my little boy

01:42:53.840 --> 01:42:55.680
Go out and have some joy

01:42:55.900 --> 01:42:56.680
Little boy

01:42:56.820 --> 01:42:58.240
Dream of my little boy

01:42:58.380 --> 01:43:00.040
Dream of my little boy

01:43:00.040 --> 01:43:28.040
Hey, little boy, do you think you'll miss her, right?

01:43:28.040 --> 01:43:33.040
She still wants to choose a man, the only one she wants to be

01:43:33.040 --> 01:43:39.040
Realize reality, you're not Mr. Right

01:43:39.040 --> 01:43:43.040
Running on that subway seat alone

01:43:43.040 --> 01:43:46.040
I'm waiting for a loving man to come

01:43:46.040 --> 01:43:49.040
Looking for a love to stay

01:43:49.040 --> 01:43:51.040
Listen what I gotta say

01:43:51.040 --> 01:43:53.040
Oh

Aye, Aye, Aye, Aye, Aye, Aye

Aye, Aye, Aye, Aye, Aye

01:46:54.080 --> 01:46:56.080
All your lives are kept in the back

01:46:56.080 --> 01:46:58.080
Aye, Aye, Aye, Aye, Aye, Aye

01:46:58.080 --> 01:47:21.080
No matter what goes on, every one of us better set us in From the bottom level to the top of the top of the top

01:47:21.080 --> 01:47:24.120
S kick you gotta get a shot inside

01:47:24.640 --> 01:47:26.040
No matter what

01:47:26.360 --> 01:47:29.480
I never told ya that it isn't work

01:47:29.660 --> 01:47:31.640
I really comparing

01:47:31.760 --> 01:47:35.960
A board that is something we all know

01:47:36.360 --> 01:47:38.120
Dadada Lila

01:47:38.160 --> 01:47:45.600
Liara Liara

01:48:15.600 --> 01:48:40.960
Hi Ho, Kermit the Frog here informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio

01:48:40.960 --> 01:48:44.960
It's brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.

01:48:44.960 --> 01:48:49.960
Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

01:48:49.960 --> 01:48:51.960
Listen, frog!

01:48:51.960 --> 01:48:53.960
Hi-ya!

01:48:53.960 --> 01:48:55.960
I love the Muppets.

01:48:55.960 --> 01:48:59.960
Anyway, we're back on Orange Moms Radio.

01:48:59.960 --> 01:49:02.960
In that break, you heard Captain Jack with Little Boy, the original.

01:49:02.960 --> 01:49:07.960
And oh my gosh, the chat room freaked out because I wasn't playing the remix that's in DDR.

01:49:07.960 --> 01:49:11.960
was the original, but it gives you guys a chance to hear maybe something you haven't

01:49:11.960 --> 01:49:12.960
heard before.

01:49:12.960 --> 01:49:13.960
Imagine that.

01:49:13.960 --> 01:49:20.000
Iko Iko from Dance Mania 21 and Dancing Pompocolin from DDR Fifth Mix.

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:21.000
Good times.

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:25.360
And did you notice, Extafur, I'm sure you noticed the lyrics in Iko Iko, did you hear

01:49:25.360 --> 01:49:26.360
Set Your Fag on Fire?

01:49:26.360 --> 01:49:27.360
I did.

01:49:27.360 --> 01:49:28.360
Because you pointed it out.

01:49:28.360 --> 01:49:32.240
Yes, at Captain Jack's request, we will be setting Extafur on fire at the end of the

01:49:32.240 --> 01:49:33.240
show.

01:49:33.240 --> 01:49:34.240
How funny.

01:49:34.240 --> 01:49:37.080
We're going to set our fag on fire.

01:49:37.080 --> 01:49:45.240
All right, um, anyway, we're going to go over to Loki.

01:49:45.240 --> 01:49:50.360
Loki's actually got some, um, Bahmani-related news going on.

01:49:50.360 --> 01:49:55.400
Uh, something about, what's this, something, somebody's doing a homebrew thingy?

01:49:55.400 --> 01:50:00.040
Yeah, I was looking for that, because I can't, I don't see it.

01:50:00.040 --> 01:50:02.520
It was there, but it's gone.

01:50:02.520 --> 01:50:09.240
Someone, of course, making games for the PSP, and the one that they had on there, which

01:50:09.240 --> 01:50:17.520
I can't find for the life of me, is called Button Master Revolution. It's like DDR, but,

01:50:17.520 --> 01:50:24.740
you know, not. And I can't find any info on it because the fucking links are gone, so

01:50:24.740 --> 01:50:30.320
fuck them for updating their stupid website and not having, like most websites do, a news

01:50:30.320 --> 01:50:35.280
archive where you can go to the next page, the next page, the next page. No! We're too

01:50:35.280 --> 01:50:42.360
good for that. So fucking A, but... Yeah, it was really cool-looking. I wish I could

01:50:42.360 --> 01:50:49.340
talk more about it, but I can't find the goddamn link, so... Yay! So we'll go... Holy...

01:50:49.340 --> 01:50:56.100
Live radio, boys and girls. Hey, I got Bahmani-related news. Go ahead. Okay, I just remembered this,

01:50:56.100 --> 01:50:59.000
because something that was just said in the chat room reminded me of this. You know they

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:06.320
They showed a little preview of the new Madonna video for Hung Up, the super gay gay gay gay

01:51:06.320 --> 01:51:09.620
gay gay song that's coming out very soon.

01:51:09.620 --> 01:51:13.300
They showed a little preview of the video on Total Request Live and somebody put it

01:51:13.300 --> 01:51:14.300
on the internet.

01:51:14.300 --> 01:51:15.300
Well, get this.

01:51:15.300 --> 01:51:16.300
Frickin' DDR's in the video.

01:51:16.300 --> 01:51:18.300
Should I show this in the little?

01:51:18.300 --> 01:51:20.740
I'll even post this link in the chat room.

01:51:20.740 --> 01:51:24.460
I'm going to post a link to the little video clip that they have and I'll play it in studio

01:51:24.460 --> 01:51:28.500
and see what you guys think here about this clip of Hung Up.

01:51:28.500 --> 01:51:32.340
actually I guess it's not really DDR but it's actually dancing stage fusion but

01:51:32.340 --> 01:51:37.900
you know DDR it's still DDR a TDR under a different name but you know Madonna

01:51:37.900 --> 01:51:44.860
she's got to be so British I is she denounced her American ship yet or is

01:51:44.860 --> 01:51:49.700
she I don't know American citizenship whatever you call it cuz you know she's

01:51:49.700 --> 01:51:55.540
called be so British let's see here we go I'm gonna play this and then I'll

01:51:55.540 --> 01:51:58.060
post this link in the chat room for you guys as well so you can check this out

01:51:58.060 --> 01:52:09.460
this is a clip of Madonna's new and it's got a video and I can't play it in

01:52:09.460 --> 01:52:15.720
Firefox I have to open up Internet Explorer because um Firefox won't play

01:52:15.720 --> 01:52:21.040
that clip but I want to play it for you guys in studio and here we go again

01:52:21.040 --> 01:52:25.000
that's posted in our chat room at orange launch radio comm click on chat and here

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:28.820
So here it is for us in the studio.

01:52:28.820 --> 01:52:51.920
Yeah, so you can see, what was Madonna doing at the end of the clip there?

01:52:51.920 --> 01:52:55.280
She's like doing that rolling in the dough thing on the DDR machine.

01:52:55.280 --> 01:52:59.560
She's really getting down on that machine, and she's kind of surrounded by her dancers,

01:52:59.560 --> 01:53:04.120
so DDR is making it into the mainstream, that's for sure.

01:53:04.120 --> 01:53:05.120
Madonna bugs me.

01:53:05.120 --> 01:53:06.120
What?

01:53:06.120 --> 01:53:07.120
And you're gay!

01:53:07.120 --> 01:53:08.120
I know, I can't stand...

01:53:08.120 --> 01:53:14.080
I've never really liked her, except for with the exception of her Oh Father video, but

01:53:14.080 --> 01:53:17.840
I don't know, just something about her, she's just pretentious.

01:53:17.840 --> 01:53:21.440
So has DDR officially jumped the shark with this or something?

01:53:21.440 --> 01:53:26.440
I don't know. I mean, I can't stand the song. I think the song absolutely sucks.

01:53:26.440 --> 01:53:30.440
That's what you said when I played it the other day.

01:53:30.440 --> 01:53:32.440
I did not say that I liked that song.

01:53:32.440 --> 01:53:35.440
You didn't say you liked it, but you said it wasn't that bad.

01:53:35.440 --> 01:53:38.440
I didn't say anything about it, I don't think.

01:53:38.440 --> 01:53:41.440
I don't even like the ABBA original.

01:53:41.440 --> 01:53:43.440
Everybody hating me now because I just said that.

01:53:43.440 --> 01:53:46.440
No, I don't. It's fine.

01:53:46.440 --> 01:53:50.440
But DDR in the video? Good thing or bad thing for DDR?

01:53:50.440 --> 01:53:55.640
I mean, that's cool and everything. Madonna, obviously, is huge.

01:53:55.640 --> 01:54:03.120
By her having the video game in her video, that's a big deal.

01:54:03.120 --> 01:54:07.760
Just me, a personal thing, I don't like her.

01:54:07.760 --> 01:54:16.960
What do you think, Loki, as a straight guy, who, as this Madonna doing an Abba thing must

01:54:16.960 --> 01:54:22.360
be very very very gay and now to see DDR in the video makes it gay gay what do

01:54:22.360 --> 01:54:27.380
you think I think she's just trying to you know throw as much pop culture

01:54:27.380 --> 01:54:34.280
references in there you know to she's insane just like you know freaking Tom

01:54:34.280 --> 01:54:39.360
Cruise okay they're all lumped together freaking crazy ass people you know what

01:54:39.360 --> 01:54:46.320
the last thing I'd be doing once I got lots of money would be going insane it's

01:54:46.320 --> 01:54:50.320
I have lots of money to buy stuff. No, I think I'll go insane instead.

01:54:50.320 --> 01:54:54.320
Let's just denounce everything. Let's be as whacked out crazy as possible.

01:54:54.320 --> 01:54:58.320
Let's become Jewish, and then Catholic, and then Jewish, and then Catholic, and then Jewish, and then Catholic.

01:54:58.320 --> 01:55:02.320
And then Kambala. And Scientologist.

01:55:02.320 --> 01:55:06.320
Yeah, so, you know, Esther can go fuck my ass.

01:55:06.320 --> 01:55:10.320
Stupid Esther. I like Madonna.

01:55:10.320 --> 01:55:14.320
I don't like Ugo over Madonna, but you know, she's cool. I respect what she's doing.

01:55:14.320 --> 01:55:18.920
Esther I mean you've got to respect Madonna's freestyle though in the video

01:55:18.920 --> 01:55:22.200
because she's looking away from the screen so I give her points for that

01:55:22.200 --> 01:55:26.120
somebody in the chair who says OMG Madonna is triple-aing paranoia survivor

01:55:26.120 --> 01:55:31.960
max only s4r you guys are nerds and making a music video at the same time

01:55:31.960 --> 01:55:42.880
angel DDR in a Madonna video good good for DDR or bad news I don't know I guess

01:55:42.880 --> 01:55:46.880
I guess it's okay, but it's Madonna, right?

01:55:46.880 --> 01:55:50.880
No.

01:55:50.880 --> 01:55:54.880
Nobody heard that.

01:55:54.880 --> 01:55:58.880
You gotta talk in the microphone if you wanna talk around here.

01:55:58.880 --> 01:56:02.880
If she's gonna do a DDR video, she should've done a live version of her

01:56:02.880 --> 01:56:06.880
Like A Virgin where she like, humped the stage. You know, the dancing stage.

01:56:06.880 --> 01:56:10.880
Okay. And on that note, Skye.

01:56:10.880 --> 01:56:14.880
Loki, do you have anything else going on in the DDR world you want to share?

01:56:14.880 --> 01:56:18.880
Didn't the new website open up or something, speaking of gay?

01:56:18.880 --> 01:56:22.880
Yeah, the Ultramix 3 website

01:56:22.880 --> 01:56:26.880
was launched and they changed the freaking logo on us

01:56:26.880 --> 01:56:30.880
to something that's super duper gay-tastic

01:56:30.880 --> 01:56:34.880
So what's the logo look like now? Well, let me just pull it up for you

01:56:34.880 --> 01:56:38.880
since that's what I do nowadays

01:56:38.880 --> 01:56:45.680
And actually what I'll do is it's really bad it basically it's kind of this party

01:56:45.680 --> 01:56:54.240
theme with a giant friggin rainbow going through it so yeah basically here it is

01:56:54.240 --> 01:57:00.960
right here okay be afraid it's giant rainbow as it's

01:57:00.960 --> 01:57:05.560
revolution rainbow tastic hey Emmys got her outfit from the graduation video I

01:57:05.560 --> 01:57:08.560
I don't make a lot of fanboys happy because that skirt is very short.

01:57:08.560 --> 01:57:10.560
Slut Emmy would have been better.

01:57:10.560 --> 01:57:11.560
But anyways.

01:57:11.560 --> 01:57:12.560
There it is.

01:57:12.560 --> 01:57:17.560
UltraMix 3 with its stupid Rainbowtastic stuff.

01:57:17.560 --> 01:57:19.560
Yeah.

01:57:19.560 --> 01:57:22.560
Interesting.

01:57:22.560 --> 01:57:23.560
So that was really lame.

01:57:23.560 --> 01:57:25.560
But they did have, um...

01:57:25.560 --> 01:57:28.560
There's some screenshots on there which, you know, sort of, you know...

01:57:28.560 --> 01:57:30.560
That's where we got all the, um...

01:57:30.560 --> 01:57:33.560
You know, new songs that were coming out and stuff.

01:57:33.560 --> 01:57:40.680
Because they had a background for, you know, Brilliant Red and all that stuff, so.

01:57:40.680 --> 01:57:45.160
But you can always check back for the Song of the Week, they've got new stuff.

01:57:45.160 --> 01:57:51.640
They had Moment 40 on there from the VRare for the Song of the Week, and then of course

01:57:51.640 --> 01:57:54.200
next week will be something better, so.

01:57:54.200 --> 01:57:57.720
Hung up by Madonna to match the theme, you think?

01:57:57.720 --> 01:57:59.700
Maybe a secret license in Ultramix 3?

01:57:59.700 --> 01:58:03.700
I don't know about that, but...

01:58:03.700 --> 01:58:05.020
Alright.

01:58:05.020 --> 01:58:08.860
Let's get into the Orange Zones Radio Cage Match tonight, shall we boys and girls?

01:58:08.860 --> 01:58:12.060
It is about that time.

01:58:12.060 --> 01:58:19.620
The way the cage match works is a reminder, we're going to play three songs for you guys. You kids get to vote for your favorite song, but you have to be in the chat room to vote.

01:58:19.620 --> 01:58:22.860
You do, or else you're going to lose.

01:58:22.860 --> 01:58:27.260
Anyway, so we're going to do the chat room tonight, three songs in the cage match.

01:58:27.260 --> 01:58:30.260
You only get to hear a clip of last week's winner though,

01:58:30.260 --> 01:58:31.860
because you already heard it last week.

01:58:31.860 --> 01:58:35.460
And it actually won two weeks in a row now, so it's going for its third win.

01:58:35.460 --> 01:58:39.900
The group is called Pendulum, and the song is called Hold Your Color.

01:58:39.900 --> 01:58:42.780
And it's song number one you can vote for in tonight's cage match, so get ready.

01:58:42.780 --> 01:58:45.940
Here comes the clip of song number one, Pendulum with Hold Your Color.

01:58:45.940 --> 01:59:13.940
When they take everything away Hold your colors against the wall

02:00:13.940 --> 02:00:19.940
When they take everything away

02:00:19.940 --> 02:00:28.940
I want you just to get away

02:00:28.940 --> 02:00:56.940
I keep looking into your eyes

02:00:56.940 --> 02:01:01.940
So I laid the name, try to make a sound

02:01:01.940 --> 02:01:08.940
The circle is gonna reach, reaching out and to see you

02:01:08.940 --> 02:01:13.940
Nothing else can touch me

02:01:13.940 --> 02:01:18.940
So can't turn around to come

02:01:21.940 --> 02:01:24.940
Alright, that was song number one

02:01:24.940 --> 02:01:28.140
last week's winner pendulum withhold your color

02:01:28.140 --> 02:01:31.860
alright we're gonna get into song number two tonight and song number two comes to

02:01:31.860 --> 02:01:32.820
us courtesy

02:01:32.820 --> 02:01:36.700
of Loki what did you pick for us tonight

02:01:36.700 --> 02:01:40.580
I picked as I promised last week

02:01:40.580 --> 02:01:46.060
I picked pendulum again

02:01:46.060 --> 02:01:47.180
there's no rules about this

02:01:47.180 --> 02:01:50.300
this is slam by pendulum

02:01:50.300 --> 02:01:53.500
I was gonna edit in the intro but then I realized that the song would be too long

02:01:53.500 --> 02:02:00.500
As a reminder, last week, Loki was pissed that Pendulum won, so he decided to put another Pendulum song in.

02:02:00.500 --> 02:02:03.500
It lost! So he's doing it again!

02:02:04.500 --> 02:02:05.500
So?

02:02:05.500 --> 02:02:09.500
I'm gonna make a rule. We're gonna make a rule. Jamie and I are gonna get together and make a rule and outvote your ass.

02:02:09.500 --> 02:02:14.500
Like, no more Pendulum and Cage Match ever, or something, and then Shane will be mad at you because it'll be your fault.

02:02:14.500 --> 02:02:15.500
It's not gonna be my fault.

02:02:15.500 --> 02:02:16.500
It'll be your fault.

02:02:16.500 --> 02:02:19.500
That's fine, I'll just put other- I'll put girls in again.

02:02:19.500 --> 02:02:21.500
Aw, shit. Alright.

02:02:21.500 --> 02:02:28.260
here it is song number two in tonight's cage match pendulum with slam

02:03:21.500 --> 02:03:23.500
But tonight

02:03:24.500 --> 02:03:26.500
On this small planet

02:04:56.500 --> 02:05:03.500
Is this bass really strung up?

02:05:26.500 --> 02:05:54.500
We're a maroon on a small island In an endless sea

02:05:54.500 --> 02:06:00.500
Confined to a Chinese bit of fear, unable to escape.

02:06:00.500 --> 02:06:05.500
But you know it, it's heavy stuff

02:08:00.500 --> 02:08:07.500
and

02:08:13.460 --> 02:08:17.500
song number two in tonight's cage match pendulum with slam let's see

02:08:17.500 --> 02:08:20.900
uh... was that song slamming or do you want to slam that song into the ground

02:08:20.900 --> 02:08:21.860
loki

02:08:21.860 --> 02:08:25.860
in the ten because you can drive with that song really loud on your radio

02:08:25.860 --> 02:08:28.820
it's all has a lot of bass in it

02:08:28.820 --> 02:08:29.820
Angel.

02:08:29.820 --> 02:08:34.820
Um, that makes me want to like, go kill Alliance now or something.

02:08:34.820 --> 02:08:39.820
Sorry to lose it by Alliance, but um, God, this thing doesn't sound like it's on.

02:08:39.820 --> 02:08:40.820
Huh!

02:08:40.820 --> 02:08:41.820
It's on.

02:08:41.820 --> 02:08:42.820
Okay.

02:08:42.820 --> 02:08:43.820
No.

02:08:43.820 --> 02:08:44.820
Um.

02:08:44.820 --> 02:08:45.820
Ah hell.

02:08:45.820 --> 02:08:46.820
Save it.

02:08:48.820 --> 02:08:49.820
I got bored.

02:08:49.820 --> 02:08:50.820
Three.

02:08:50.820 --> 02:08:51.820
Extra room.

02:08:51.820 --> 02:08:54.820
Um, I kind of got bored too.

02:08:54.820 --> 02:09:02.820
Um, but Loki did make a good point that this would be a good song to blast out here at Harvard.

02:09:02.820 --> 02:09:05.820
Yeah, if you want to put the other people on the road to sleep.

02:09:05.820 --> 02:09:08.820
Well, unless, you don't knock it till you've tried it.

02:09:08.820 --> 02:09:09.820
Okay.

02:09:09.820 --> 02:09:11.820
Alright, so I give it an 8 for that.

02:09:11.820 --> 02:09:13.820
Alright.

02:09:13.820 --> 02:09:17.820
Remember, it's not our thoughts that count, it's yours. You have the final say.

02:09:17.820 --> 02:09:19.820
Here's song number 3 in tonight's Cage Match.

02:09:19.820 --> 02:09:25.140

02:09:29.180 --> 02:09:35.240

extreme USA it's junior senior remember them they did move your feet this is

coconuts to this song. It's song number three in tonight's skating match. Enjoy.

02:11:15.540 --> 02:11:17.540
Hands in the air

02:11:17.540 --> 02:11:20.540
Hey boys and girls, we want to see what you've got

02:11:20.540 --> 02:11:24.540
We wanna see you shaking coconut

02:11:38.540 --> 02:11:41.540
We'll get up to speak some music

02:11:41.540 --> 02:11:44.540
We'll get down to present time

02:12:14.540 --> 02:12:23.180
Alright, song number three in tonight's cage match, junior-senior with Shake Your Coconuts.

02:12:23.180 --> 02:12:25.180
Did you shake your coconuts?

02:12:25.180 --> 02:12:26.620
Or was that song just nuts?

02:12:26.620 --> 02:12:27.620
I don't know.

02:12:27.620 --> 02:12:28.620
Loki.

02:12:28.620 --> 02:12:29.620
Get Loki and Mike.

02:12:29.620 --> 02:12:30.620
That was lame.

02:12:30.620 --> 02:12:32.620
That was really lame.

02:12:32.620 --> 02:12:35.340
That was awful lame.

02:12:35.340 --> 02:12:37.340
It kids of four.

02:12:37.340 --> 02:12:38.340
Angel.

02:12:38.340 --> 02:12:42.340
It was okay.

02:12:42.340 --> 02:12:50.340
I don't mind that song, but, um, no, six-and-a-half.

02:12:50.340 --> 02:12:52.340
Ex-defirm.

02:12:52.340 --> 02:12:58.340
Forgive me for saying this, but I felt like busting a nut.

02:12:58.340 --> 02:13:01.340
God damn it, I hate you!

02:13:01.340 --> 02:13:05.340
They said shake your coconut till the nut comes out or something like that.

02:13:05.340 --> 02:13:06.340
I think so, yes.

02:13:06.340 --> 02:13:10.340
That's pretty foul. I give it, like I said, for that.

02:13:10.340 --> 02:13:16.340
But vote for song 2, because we don't want song 1 to win, because I'm behind Loki's whole team here.

02:13:16.340 --> 02:13:17.340
Holy shit up.

02:13:18.340 --> 02:13:27.340
I thought that song was awesome, you know why? Because it wasn't Pendulum, so therefore it gets an 8 automatically, because it was awesome for not being Pendulum.

02:13:27.340 --> 02:13:30.340
I don't think 8 really translates to Awesome Log.

02:13:30.340 --> 02:13:32.340
It's not Orgasmic.

02:13:32.340 --> 02:13:34.340
No, no, no, I don't think it really does.

02:13:34.340 --> 02:13:35.340
Shut up.

02:13:35.340 --> 02:13:36.340
Orgasmic could be 11.

02:13:36.340 --> 02:13:37.340
Shut up.

02:13:37.340 --> 02:13:42.780
Let's recap the songs you can vote for in tonight's cage match.

02:13:42.780 --> 02:13:46.900
Song number one is Pendulum with Hold Your Color.

02:13:46.900 --> 02:13:56.100
It's last week's winner.

02:13:56.100 --> 02:14:11.660
And song number two you can vote for in tonight's cage match is Slam.

02:14:11.660 --> 02:14:18.500
And song number three you can vote for tonight is Junior Senior with Shake Yo' Coconuts.

02:14:18.500 --> 02:14:31.220
Please vote now, send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote, and we'll

02:14:31.220 --> 02:14:32.220
let you know who won.

02:14:32.220 --> 02:14:33.700
Remember, it's not up to us.

02:14:33.700 --> 02:14:36.340
We're just big idiots on the-

02:14:36.340 --> 02:14:37.900
We're like American Idol judges.

02:14:37.900 --> 02:14:40.900
Yeah, kind of, and it really isn't up to us.

02:14:40.900 --> 02:14:42.540
You would be Paula Abdul.

02:14:42.540 --> 02:14:43.820
I'm not Paula Abdul.

02:14:43.820 --> 02:14:46.380
You're totally the Paula Abdul.

02:14:46.380 --> 02:14:48.980
I'm Randy. Dog.

02:14:48.980 --> 02:14:54.180
What up, dog? What up, dog? What's up, dog pound? I can't stand that fucking show

02:14:54.180 --> 02:15:00.420
right now. You watch it every year! I know, and the thing is it's just like TV crack.

02:15:00.420 --> 02:15:01.860
You know, it's like

02:15:01.860 --> 02:15:05.540
you have to watch something that's kind of a guilty pleasure

02:15:05.540 --> 02:15:08.820
that you can't stand, but you watch it anyway.

02:15:08.820 --> 02:15:10.260
Kind of like Jerry Springer.

02:15:10.260 --> 02:15:12.520
Ringmaster was on TV today. I had to watch it.

02:15:12.520 --> 02:15:13.900
It was some of it.

02:15:13.900 --> 02:15:17.600
because I actually saw Ringmaster in the theater the day it opened

02:15:17.600 --> 02:15:21.600
four people in the theater

02:15:21.600 --> 02:15:24.880
me and my roommate at the time and some other schmoes

02:15:24.880 --> 02:15:29.080
was that Loki? no it wasn't Loki, no it was, Ringmaster opened up like when I was in college

02:15:29.080 --> 02:15:29.960
it was years ago

02:15:29.960 --> 02:15:33.280
years ago yeah I never saw it

02:15:33.280 --> 02:15:37.140
I never saw it. Jerry Springer is still on the show

02:15:37.140 --> 02:15:41.520
you still got a show yeah so does Maury

02:15:41.520 --> 02:15:45.320
That's Maury. Why? I don't know. Who watches Maury?

02:15:45.320 --> 02:15:50.640
Maury's got a very, it's got a very fine schedule to it too. It's like Mondays

02:15:50.640 --> 02:15:53.880
is I don't believe you my baby daddy.

02:15:53.880 --> 02:15:57.880
Day two is send my kids to boot camp.

02:15:57.880 --> 02:16:01.720
Day three is my baby fat.

02:16:01.720 --> 02:16:06.240
Day four would be I know I'm fat but I'm gorgeous.

02:16:06.240 --> 02:16:11.000
How many times have you accidentally found yourself channel surfing and

02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:15.000
The channel lands on Maury Povich, and it's about their baby being fat.

02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:19.000
It's like, dude, stop feeding your kid!

02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:23.000
Like, shit!

02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:27.000
And we're supposed to feel sympathy. The mom's like,

02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:31.000
I don't know what to do! Fuck, bitch, stop feeding your kid!

02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:35.000
I suppose we should get

02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:39.000
into the- do you have a movie review for us tonight, Ecstifer? I forgot to ask.

02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:43.900
Christopher, I forgot to mention, our work, because, you know, I worked at a video distributor,

02:16:43.900 --> 02:16:50.900
Wednesday we get, in our theater, we get to watch Serenity. So, for free. And we get pizza!

02:16:50.900 --> 02:16:53.900
That is double awesome! Well, I hope you enjoy it.

02:16:53.900 --> 02:16:57.900
And, you know, seeing Serenity for free is about the only way people are seeing it these

02:16:57.900 --> 02:17:03.140
days, apparently, because the movie's not making any money right now.

02:17:03.140 --> 02:17:05.700
That is very funny to you, isn't it?

02:17:05.700 --> 02:17:07.020
Statistic bitch.

02:17:07.020 --> 02:17:15.340
No, but I saw it for free, actually, a couple months ago, maybe, a month and a half, and

02:17:15.340 --> 02:17:19.900
it was really good free, but it was also good when I paid money, so, you know.

02:17:19.900 --> 02:17:20.900
Yeah.

02:17:20.900 --> 02:17:21.900
All right.

02:17:21.900 --> 02:17:24.660
Are you going to do a movie review for us tonight?

02:17:24.660 --> 02:17:25.660
Sure.

02:17:25.660 --> 02:17:27.100
I'll think up a movie review.

02:17:27.100 --> 02:17:30.940
I haven't seen really any movies this week, so I'll think up one.

02:17:30.940 --> 02:17:33.820
please don't play the game music

02:17:33.820 --> 02:17:37.540
so you know if you're going to be later my family's been watching desperate

02:17:37.540 --> 02:17:39.780
housewives of god

02:17:39.780 --> 02:17:43.580
she's jumped on that thing going on

02:17:43.580 --> 02:17:45.660
everybody pity me

02:17:45.660 --> 02:17:48.980
next thing you know it's gonna be lost to

02:17:48.980 --> 02:17:52.700
like this bitch watches every week we have the season one box that it's in my

02:17:52.700 --> 02:17:58.300
pile of stuff that's going to be returned to games up for games

02:17:58.300 --> 02:18:02.300
Yeah, we have lost, and she wants to watch that too. I'm like, noooo.

02:18:02.300 --> 02:18:08.300
Um, we need to get to your sim update, Loki. What's going on in the sim scene?

02:18:08.300 --> 02:18:12.300
Okay, okay, I actually do have the story now about that stupid Button Mash Revolution thing.

02:18:12.300 --> 02:18:16.300
Um, finally found it because, you know, PSP updates hide their shit.

02:18:16.300 --> 02:18:21.300
Anyways, it's this game called Button Mash Revolution version 1. It's for the PSP.

02:18:21.300 --> 02:18:25.300
You can only run it if you have a version 1.5, um, firmware.

02:18:25.300 --> 02:18:29.940
And basically, it's like DDR except you use your buttons, there are no arrows instead,

02:18:29.940 --> 02:18:35.020
there are the four corresponding buttons that are on the PSP, and there's music in it, and

02:18:35.020 --> 02:18:37.180
someone made it in Lua.

02:18:37.180 --> 02:18:40.460
So I don't really know what kind of music is in it, because I haven't downloaded it

02:18:40.460 --> 02:18:44.540
yet, but it looks kind of fun, so if you're looking for something to waste some space

02:18:44.540 --> 02:18:48.320
in your memory card, check it out at pspupdates.com.

02:18:48.320 --> 02:18:53.180
You're going to have to actually, it's going to be tough to find, but it's Button Mash

02:18:53.180 --> 02:19:00.220
Revolution version 1. And that's one thing. The other thing that's worth mentioning is

02:19:00.220 --> 02:19:07.520
actually a game that's kind of on the internet right now. It's made by the creators of Easy

02:19:07.520 --> 02:19:14.440
to DJ and it's called DJ Max. Now they have DJ Max Portable which is coming to the PSP

02:19:14.440 --> 02:19:19.420
in December and it's actually very similar to Beatmania. Very similar to Beatmania. So

02:19:19.420 --> 02:19:23.020
So this is definitely going to be one I'm going to be checking out as soon as it comes

02:19:23.020 --> 02:19:24.020
out.

02:19:24.020 --> 02:19:26.020
But they do have some screenshots.

02:19:26.020 --> 02:19:29.140
It looks amazing so far.

02:19:29.140 --> 02:19:32.900
Just be really awesome to see some more music games coming to the PSP.

02:19:32.900 --> 02:19:40.540
And if you want to check out the website, I believe it's djmaxx.com, but I'm not positive.

02:19:40.540 --> 02:19:45.580
Just search for DJ Maxx and I'm sure you'll find it.

02:19:45.580 --> 02:19:50.260
other than that, really, um, I don't think there's too much else going on in the sim scene.

02:19:50.260 --> 02:19:54.380
I haven't been really paying attention to the sim scene because

02:19:54.380 --> 02:19:57.260
nothing really interesting has been going on for me.

02:19:57.260 --> 02:20:03.260
You know, tournaments and stuff, just like, eh, don't care.

02:20:03.260 --> 02:20:04.740
Well, I'm glad you're, um,

02:20:04.740 --> 02:20:09.220
a faithful reporter in the sim industry. There's really nothing going on, honestly, I mean,

02:20:09.220 --> 02:20:13.020
I'm sure if Mysore had their sim section up, they'd be more crappy remixes of

02:20:13.020 --> 02:20:17.660
Max, but unfortunately I can't report on that because there is no sim section anymore. I

02:20:17.660 --> 02:20:24.660
do know of a new torrent site that came up though that has some stuff on it, but yeah.

02:20:24.900 --> 02:20:29.500
That's about it. I'm more interested in checking out Ultramix 3 when that comes out in a couple

02:20:29.500 --> 02:20:34.580
weeks. This was all my 360 games becoming at the same time.

02:20:34.580 --> 02:20:38.580
I know, I gotta save my money for the 360. I'm not looking forward to spending that kind

02:20:38.580 --> 02:20:40.700
of money, but what can you do?

02:20:40.700 --> 02:20:49.700
I'm gonna be getting my controllers. I've got about four games lined up, just, you know, with all the store credit I've, you know, earned in the last few months, and just fun stuff like that.

02:20:49.700 --> 02:20:57.700
And hopefully, because not all that stuff's first party, hopefully I can hit up some of our publishers and go, hey, can you send me a free copy? Hey, come on.

02:20:57.700 --> 02:21:05.700
Xbox Live, they're taking it down for a day to do some, like, adjustments or something. So, are they gonna have the Xbox 360, like, interface on the regular Xbox or something?

02:21:05.700 --> 02:21:06.700
Xbox or something?

02:21:06.700 --> 02:21:07.700
I don't know.

02:21:07.700 --> 02:21:09.980
Well, they're taking down Live because they're updating everything.

02:21:09.980 --> 02:21:12.780
They're going to actually have a website now where you can download all your stats and

02:21:12.780 --> 02:21:16.540
everything on Live and people can actually view all that stuff, what games you're playing,

02:21:16.540 --> 02:21:18.660
what accomplishments you've done.

02:21:18.660 --> 02:21:22.420
They've been announcing more stuff for the Xbox Live Arcade, the new one being Tetris

02:21:22.420 --> 02:21:28.500
is now on there because Tetris is on every system on the man, and just lots of cool stuff

02:21:28.500 --> 02:21:30.020
they're doing for Live.

02:21:30.020 --> 02:21:33.940
I'm hoping that they're not using the same gamer tags, though, because I really want

02:21:33.940 --> 02:21:36.540
and they're like, first thing to get Loki, but...

02:21:36.540 --> 02:21:39.920
Yeah, I'm wondering if they're going to carry the gamertags over, because...

02:21:39.920 --> 02:21:43.660
I don't think... I wouldn't think so, but... It would be interesting if they did. They might, who knows?

02:21:43.660 --> 02:21:47.380
Yeah, I think they would have to for the backwards compatibility thing. I think they'd have to.

02:21:47.380 --> 02:21:51.140
Maybe. Well, that's okay. I have a backup name just in case, so... What's that?

02:21:51.140 --> 02:21:53.440
I can't say, because someone's going to steal it.

02:21:53.440 --> 02:21:54.780
Oh, okay.

02:21:54.780 --> 02:21:59.440
It's not too far from, you know, the name I go by, but...

02:21:59.440 --> 02:22:05.880
like super Loki? Loki6969 slide?

02:22:05.880 --> 02:22:11.800
No. Don't say my frickin' World of Warcraft name on error.

02:22:11.800 --> 02:22:16.120
Or, um, you know, close enough. He doesn't have a mic, it doesn't matter.

02:22:16.120 --> 02:22:18.360
This is a good thing.

02:22:18.360 --> 02:22:19.680
Okay, um,

02:22:19.680 --> 02:22:22.840
let's get to Extrovert's movie review before we get to a break.

02:22:22.840 --> 02:22:27.200
You don't have a movie yet? Okay, fine, we'll have to go to a break.

02:22:27.200 --> 02:22:34.200
We are going to play some other music this break, because we have been doing Captain Jack most of the night, but we want to work in some other stuff.

02:22:34.200 --> 02:22:39.200
I've actually had a few requests for some other songs some folks want to hear tonight, so I want to get to some of those.

02:22:39.200 --> 02:22:45.200
So I think we'll do a little bit of 2DX music this break, and we'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.

02:22:45.200 --> 02:22:51.200
We're going to get into the FUs of the week, and if we're feeling like it, maybe a little bit of Ask Orange Lounge, if you're lucky.

02:22:51.200 --> 02:22:58.200
We'll be back after this with more Orange Launch Video.

02:23:51.200 --> 02:23:55.200
and

02:23:55.200 --> 02:23:59.200
and

02:23:59.200 --> 02:24:03.200
and

02:24:03.200 --> 02:24:07.200
and

02:24:07.200 --> 02:24:11.200
and

02:24:11.200 --> 02:24:15.200
and

02:24:15.200 --> 02:24:19.200
and

02:24:49.200 --> 02:25:10.800
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah You must be, you must be, you must be

02:25:10.800 --> 02:25:12.800
You know they mean the best of my balls

02:25:25.300 --> 02:25:27.300
Two chicks a-nakin' with the beef

02:25:32.300 --> 02:25:34.300
Two chicks a-nakin' with the beef

02:25:37.300 --> 02:25:40.300
You're gonna make me feel like you're not even free

02:25:40.300 --> 02:25:47.300
Don't make me feel that you're loving me now

02:26:17.300 --> 02:26:21.300
Wherever I want to go

02:26:24.300 --> 02:26:28.300
I must be there to say

02:26:58.300 --> 02:27:00.300
You

02:28:28.300 --> 02:28:30.300
Yay!

02:28:58.300 --> 02:29:07.300
I'm burning up for you, I'm burning up for you

02:29:28.300 --> 02:29:39.300
I'm gonna be my masterful but I need you to be with you

02:29:39.300 --> 02:29:43.300
To make a sky more than a moon

02:29:43.300 --> 02:29:48.300
Hey, I know that I'm losing you tonight

02:29:48.300 --> 02:29:51.300
I want something else

02:29:51.300 --> 02:29:55.300
I'm trying to get through

02:29:55.300 --> 02:30:02.300
I'm burning up for you, I'm burning up for you

02:30:02.300 --> 02:30:07.300
I'm burning every time that I look at you

02:30:07.300 --> 02:30:14.300
I'm burning up for you, I'm burning up for you

02:30:14.300 --> 02:30:22.300
I don't know anybody the way I do

02:30:22.300 --> 02:30:47.580
So uncensored that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.

02:30:47.580 --> 02:30:54.580
the

02:30:55.180 --> 02:30:55.880
alone

02:30:55.880 --> 02:30:58.780
we're back here on orange lounge radio

02:30:58.780 --> 02:31:02.140
just having ourselves a good old time on this sunday evening thank you for

02:31:02.140 --> 02:31:05.780
deciding to tune in and listen to us we appreciate it

02:31:05.780 --> 02:31:08.140
although i'm kinda tired today i'm just like uh...

02:31:08.140 --> 02:31:11.700
kind of uh... sluggish i know it's a lazy sunday

02:31:11.700 --> 02:31:13.820
of course we were up like totally late last night

02:31:13.820 --> 02:31:18.020
And I've been doing a little drinking so maybe I didn't I watch to drink though

02:31:18.020 --> 02:31:21.820
Maybe I have a little bit of a hangover. Maybe a little bit a little bit

02:31:23.400 --> 02:31:27.620
We'll see um so I guess now is the part of the show where

02:31:28.180 --> 02:31:30.540
I'm not going to do extra first movie review. Oh

02:31:31.220 --> 02:31:33.460
Because I want to tell you guys who won tonight's cage match

02:31:34.380 --> 02:31:36.520
Okay, which is certainly something we need to hear about

02:31:37.100 --> 02:31:41.260
So the winner of tonight's cage match it was one vote deciding things tonight

02:31:41.260 --> 02:31:45.960
you guys. It was a very, very close cage match, except for song number two, which got like

02:31:45.960 --> 02:31:52.100
no votes. But the winning song by one vote in tonight's cage match is...

02:31:52.100 --> 02:32:03.740
Tensellum, Hold Your Color. For the third week in a row next week, it goes for retirement.

02:32:03.740 --> 02:32:08.540
If it is the winner next week, it will be retired and will be the first song to be retired

02:32:08.540 --> 02:32:12.740
in quite a while. I think we had a song get retired by default, but I don't even remember

02:32:12.740 --> 02:32:17.740
because we missed two shows, and so it kind of held over for four weeks. I want to say

02:32:17.740 --> 02:32:22.980
it was something from Wangan or something. I don't remember, though. I think it was one

02:32:22.980 --> 02:32:31.580
of Dark Soccer's songs. Maybe one of the people in chat remembers. Anyway, what we're going

02:32:31.580 --> 02:32:35.940
to do now is we're going to get into Extrofer's movie review. Extrofer!

02:32:35.940 --> 02:32:40.940
Hello. It's time for your movie reveal. Oh my god.

02:32:40.940 --> 02:32:45.940
Play anything. Even the Madonna song. It's okay.

02:32:45.940 --> 02:32:52.940
Okay. No. Okay. I spoke out of... I didn't mean to say that.

02:32:52.940 --> 02:32:55.940
And I'm starting the review. You can't play the song now.

02:32:55.940 --> 02:32:59.940
Okay. What are you going to be reviewing?

02:32:59.940 --> 02:33:02.940
The movie I'm reviewing this week is Sphere.

02:33:02.940 --> 02:33:07.060
Remember that movie, Terror Can Fill Any Space?

02:33:07.060 --> 02:33:08.060
No.

02:33:08.060 --> 02:33:09.060
Oh.

02:33:09.060 --> 02:33:15.140
Well, that's what it says on the box art of Sphere, and it's from the best-selling author

02:33:15.140 --> 02:33:21.460
of Jurassic Park and The Lost World, otherwise known as Michael Crichton.

02:33:21.460 --> 02:33:23.460
Little info on some critics here.

02:33:23.460 --> 02:33:30.020
Janet Maslin from the New York Times called it rich in techno terror, a solid thriller

02:33:30.020 --> 02:33:35.020
directed with sustained tension. I'm not sure what Techno Terror is.

02:33:35.020 --> 02:33:40.060
Well, I wasn't sure until I read that and I noticed it was on the back of this

02:33:40.060 --> 02:33:45.620
case for Sphere. So I guess Sphere would be called Techno Terror.

02:33:45.620 --> 02:33:53.140
Anyways, so I think Sphere was okay. I mean, it wasn't great, but if you want

02:33:53.140 --> 02:33:57.660
to see Queen Latifah get killed by Jellyfish, then I guess that would be the

02:33:57.660 --> 02:34:03.260
movie to watch like you know her getting killed by jellyfish Rob do you have

02:34:03.260 --> 02:34:08.500
anything add to that from getting eaten by jellyfish to Pizza Hut commercials

02:34:08.500 --> 02:34:12.460
yeah basically the movie the premise of the movie is that everybody's fears

02:34:12.460 --> 02:34:16.940
manifest themselves and they're down and they're down under like deep deep deep

02:34:16.940 --> 02:34:24.980
and you know and to the ocean or water or whatever and basically like people

02:34:24.980 --> 02:34:28.420
get killed by their own fears, basically, and Queen Latifah is...

02:34:28.420 --> 02:34:32.420
Hey, Exteror, can you hold on a minute?

02:34:32.420 --> 02:34:35.420
Sorry, I'm rocking out a little bit.

02:34:35.420 --> 02:34:37.420
Of course you are.

02:34:37.420 --> 02:34:39.420
Okay, sorry, go ahead.

02:34:39.420 --> 02:34:45.780
So, I'm sorry, I just got stupid just then, because you played that song.

02:34:45.780 --> 02:34:51.020
No, so the movie basically is really average.

02:34:51.020 --> 02:34:59.660
I would give it a thumb sideways because, you know, I'd give it an apathetic thumb anywhere

02:34:59.660 --> 02:35:01.820
because I don't really care.

02:35:01.820 --> 02:35:06.060
And you know, again, Queen Latifah died from jellyfish in it.

02:35:06.060 --> 02:35:12.060
Again, I'd like to reiterate, she died from jellyfish, she was like, oh my God, I got

02:35:12.060 --> 02:35:15.860
killed by some damn jellyfish.

02:35:15.860 --> 02:35:20.900
Oh my God, I got to do Pizza Hut commercials and I have to do bringing down the house with

02:35:20.900 --> 02:35:24.900
Steve Martin in a few years. I can't die from them damn jellyfish?

02:35:24.900 --> 02:35:26.900
And don't forget Chicago.

02:35:26.900 --> 02:35:27.900
Chicago too!

02:35:27.900 --> 02:35:29.900
When you're good to momma, momma's good to you, remember?

02:35:29.900 --> 02:35:31.900
That's right.

02:35:31.900 --> 02:35:33.900
She said...

02:35:33.900 --> 02:35:35.900
Damn... God damn jellyfish.

02:35:35.900 --> 02:35:37.900
No, the jellyfish, that was really funny.

02:35:37.900 --> 02:35:40.900
And she's like, she acts really scared in it. It's great.

02:35:40.900 --> 02:35:42.900
That's the best scene in the movie.

02:35:42.900 --> 02:35:44.900
Ooh, Queen Latifah getting eaten by jellyfish.

02:35:44.900 --> 02:35:45.900
Yeah, being eaten by jellyfish.

02:35:45.900 --> 02:35:46.900
So...

02:35:46.900 --> 02:35:50.900
So, Spierer gets his apathetic thumb, but Queen Latifah getting eaten by jellyfish is what I'm saying.

02:35:50.900 --> 02:35:55.900
That is really the high point of the movie. It's really kind of at the beginning, so I would recommend that part.

02:35:55.900 --> 02:36:01.900
So, I'm glad you listened to my little, you know, segment here. It was so interesting.

02:36:03.900 --> 02:36:05.900
Listen tomorrow. It's my new show.

02:36:05.900 --> 02:36:08.900
I'm rocking out. I'm rocking out. See, you're gay ABBA.

02:36:08.900 --> 02:36:09.900
It's not my gay ABBA.

02:36:09.900 --> 02:36:11.900
Yeah, you're gay ABBA.

02:36:11.900 --> 02:36:19.900
I still say there should be a machine called the ABBA, like an ABB machine.

02:36:19.900 --> 02:36:24.900
Every single time you crunch, it'll play a little bit of Dancing Queen or something.

02:36:24.900 --> 02:36:25.900
Okay.

02:36:25.900 --> 02:36:32.900
Or it'll go, dee dee dee dee dee, like as you crunch it.

02:36:32.900 --> 02:36:36.900
I think it's about time that we get into the Orange Launch Radio Cage match.

02:36:36.900 --> 02:36:38.900
I think we're starting to get into that portion of the show.

02:36:38.900 --> 02:36:41.860
I'm sure some of you guys are starting to get a little angsty you guys

02:36:43.700 --> 02:36:46.680
That's the cage man, yeah, I'm sorry if use the week

02:36:48.140 --> 02:36:51.060
It's one of those nights. I don't give a fuck tonight. I really don't

02:36:52.980 --> 02:36:57.500
That's right, we're gonna get into the F use the week because we're angsty maybe we're angsty because of cage match

02:36:57.500 --> 02:36:59.500
I don't know. But anyway, um

02:37:00.820 --> 02:37:04.940
Dark soccer isn't here tonight, but usually this is the part of the show where I would say dark soccer

02:37:04.940 --> 02:37:08.300
So why is it we do the FUs of the Week every single week and then what would she say?

02:37:08.300 --> 02:37:10.620
Something like, uh, because we're angsty?

02:37:10.620 --> 02:37:22.980
No, she says grr argh, right?

02:37:22.980 --> 02:37:27.460
DarkSakura did leave a little message for me on AOL because she was a little bit angsty.

02:37:27.460 --> 02:37:31.380
She said, had the most retarded field trip for school today.

02:37:31.380 --> 02:37:33.020
That's my FU.

02:37:33.020 --> 02:37:34.740
Retarded field trips.

02:37:34.740 --> 02:37:41.200
I didn't know you got to go on field trips in college. Maybe I should have finished.

02:37:41.200 --> 02:37:45.800
Loki, what's your FUs of the week?

02:37:45.800 --> 02:37:51.220
Um, my first FU goes to, um, super driver's out there because you're driving too damn slow

02:37:51.220 --> 02:37:52.380
and getting in my way.

02:37:52.380 --> 02:37:58.180
Um, my other FU goes to my apartment complex for deciding to repave the entire, um,

02:37:58.180 --> 02:37:59.900
parking lot and basically

02:37:59.900 --> 02:38:04.100
rearrange some of the parking spaces and putting in some brand new handicapped ones because the handicapped

02:38:04.100 --> 02:38:08.500
people have, like, all these 15 spaces that they can park in for all the two handicapped

02:38:08.500 --> 02:38:13.140
people in our complex. And they have, they put them in some really stupid spots, like,

02:38:13.140 --> 02:38:17.620
this one that's in this, um, one spot where the actual ramp to where the handicapped people

02:38:17.620 --> 02:38:22.020
can go up is, like, way far away from it, and also the fact that there's a giant curve

02:38:22.020 --> 02:38:26.880
in its way, so it's kind of pointless to have a ramp there anyways. So, my apartment complex

02:38:26.880 --> 02:38:30.700
is retarded. And also, fuck you to these stupid kids that keep throwing this tennis ball against

02:38:30.700 --> 02:38:33.820
dumpster and playing butts up

02:38:33.820 --> 02:38:38.140
do what i remember butts up that game was awesome these kids need to go someplace so i stole

02:38:38.140 --> 02:38:43.540
their tennis ball and it's in my house now but they bought another one so i had to steal that one too

02:38:43.540 --> 02:38:44.740
you see this? this is mine now

02:38:44.740 --> 02:38:46.460
this is mine now

02:38:46.460 --> 02:38:48.820
exactly

02:38:48.820 --> 02:38:50.340
freaking stupid people i hate them

02:38:50.340 --> 02:38:55.020
and also uh... fuck you the stupid woman that basically uh... got all pissed off for

02:38:55.020 --> 02:38:57.380
nelly having taken out her uh...

02:38:57.380 --> 02:39:00.780
lottery they've been sitting in one of the washers just unattended

02:39:00.780 --> 02:39:03.520
because there was a regarded cycle and she's off

02:39:03.520 --> 02:39:07.020
where my clothes at

02:39:07.020 --> 02:39:09.140
and she's like well they're in the basket

02:39:09.140 --> 02:39:12.580
better not be stealing my clothes

02:39:12.580 --> 02:39:17.460
and she had and she had her like freakin shower cap on and stuff

02:39:17.460 --> 02:39:21.620
total ghetto woman you should have threatened them with some jellyfish

02:39:21.620 --> 02:39:23.160
where my clothes at

02:39:23.160 --> 02:39:28.380
I can tell you this much, I'd be handling the situation differently if it were me

02:39:28.380 --> 02:39:32.880
you know, if I was in there, I'd be, you know, she'd be like, where my clothes at, and I'd be like

02:39:32.880 --> 02:39:35.960
talking English, bitch!

02:39:35.960 --> 02:39:37.360
So, yeah.

02:39:37.360 --> 02:39:44.360
That's my effusive week.

02:39:46.580 --> 02:39:51.080
I'm relatively angst free. I got most of my angst out in my live journal earlier this week

02:39:51.080 --> 02:39:54.680
because that's what live journals for is for me me me's I know they're called

02:39:54.680 --> 02:39:59.980
maims or whatever but I call me me's live drills for me me's and me venting

02:39:59.980 --> 02:40:02.960
once in a while so I've got actually got most of it out of my system so I feel

02:40:02.960 --> 02:40:10.400
pretty good but just an F you to like three days this week I ended up staying

02:40:10.400 --> 02:40:13.720
at work like way later than I was originally intending to and I don't like

02:40:13.720 --> 02:40:19.680
that but F you two dumbasses in World of Warcraft because there's been a couple

02:40:19.680 --> 02:40:24.680
that kind of pissed me off. A nephew to the fact that I haven't gotten onto other servers yet, but I swear I'm going to at some point.

02:40:24.680 --> 02:40:31.680
Um, and a nephew to, um, me having to save money for an Xbox 360, because I don't like being poor.

02:40:31.680 --> 02:40:33.680
Being poor sucks.

02:40:33.680 --> 02:40:34.680
That's it.

02:40:34.680 --> 02:40:39.680
Um, let's get to Angel and Angel's FUs of the Week.

02:40:39.680 --> 02:40:42.680
Oh, let's see.

02:40:42.680 --> 02:40:57.680
Yeah, I'm still kind of pretty pissed off at my computer even though it works now, so F you to that, because if it hadn't broken down I would be level 40 by now, because, um, yeah, damn level requirements for guilds, Jesus!

02:40:57.680 --> 02:41:04.680
Speaking of which, I have to hit level 50 by next Tuesday, so maybe to that, too, because I don't even know if I'm gonna make it.

02:41:04.680 --> 02:41:13.680
Other than that... Oh, yeah, I've been having to go to school four days a week now. Ouch.

02:41:13.680 --> 02:41:22.680
But it must be done. Why? Because then I can get a better job later on or something, or whatever you're supposed to do after you go to school.

02:41:22.680 --> 02:41:28.680
Okay, that's really it. I'm not really that pissy this week or something.

02:41:28.680 --> 02:41:33.680
So, um, yeah, until next time.

02:41:33.680 --> 02:41:37.680
Xtaphir, what are your FUs of the week?

02:41:37.680 --> 02:41:42.680
Um, FU to God, because if you really do exist, you're fucking with my week.

02:41:42.680 --> 02:41:46.680
I mean, Jesus Christ, God.

02:41:46.680 --> 02:41:52.940
I am so fucking pissed off because like I like you know will be very very fine

02:41:52.940 --> 02:41:57.360
and everything then I go to the lab and I try to give blood and suddenly I almost

02:41:57.360 --> 02:42:01.120
faint you were trying to give blood I mean I was trying to get blood work done

02:42:01.120 --> 02:42:05.280
and now I have to go back to the lab because they couldn't do enough work and

02:42:05.280 --> 02:42:10.960
you know just more you know stuff that I have to like think about doing so yeah

02:42:10.960 --> 02:42:22.960
Yeah, so F you to that. F you to, like, just last week in general. I don't know. It was just a really difficult week.

02:42:22.960 --> 02:42:31.960
No, actually, you know, it ended really well. I mean, we had a good night last night. Good partay-ing. Partaking in a partay.

02:42:31.960 --> 02:42:33.960
It was neat.

02:42:33.960 --> 02:42:35.960
It was nifty.

02:42:35.960 --> 02:42:37.960
But otherwise, yeah.

02:42:37.960 --> 02:42:42.960
Otherwise, after you, everyone who won't listen to my show tomorrow, at 7 o'clock,

02:42:42.960 --> 02:42:45.960
X-O-T-C-M.

02:42:45.960 --> 02:42:47.960
Will you be playing Madonna hung up on your show?

02:42:47.960 --> 02:42:48.960
I will not be playing.

02:42:48.960 --> 02:42:49.960
I'm going to request this.

02:42:49.960 --> 02:42:51.960
I will not be playing that song.

02:42:51.960 --> 02:42:54.960
You know, I haven't even talked about the Rob Roberts show on Wednesday,

02:42:54.960 --> 02:42:58.960
which is going to be a big, huge Mondo OLR event.

02:42:58.960 --> 02:43:13.360
darkknight â F you to work and finding out that I have no car

02:43:13.360 --> 02:43:20.360
And of course, FU to gas prices even though they are starting to go down just a tad.

02:43:43.360 --> 02:43:48.760

after clearing max 300 standard what that that doesn't happen

02:44:00.800 --> 02:44:03.800

02:44:40.200 --> 02:44:46.880
like the best track ever.

02:44:46.880 --> 02:44:51.520
Gloatwalk says F you to the coat hanger in the handicap stall in the bathroom at my workplace.

02:44:51.520 --> 02:44:55.240
That damn thing was placed so low it practically punctured my right arm and I've got a huge

02:44:55.240 --> 02:44:58.040
honking bruise the size of two silver dollars.

02:44:58.040 --> 02:45:02.320
DAMN YOU!

02:45:02.320 --> 02:45:06.560
Color of Sakura says F you to the fact that I was diagnosed with a peptic ulcer last week

02:45:36.560 --> 02:45:47.800
And are they all chain letters?

02:45:47.800 --> 02:45:48.800
I hate that shit.

02:45:48.800 --> 02:45:49.800
Me too.

02:45:49.800 --> 02:45:52.180
That's why I'm kinda glad Myspace exists, because that's where all the chain letters

02:45:52.180 --> 02:45:53.180
go now.

02:45:53.180 --> 02:45:59.700
GS191 says, F you to Tommy Tallarco for giving Weehart Katamari a fucking 3 out of 10.

02:45:59.700 --> 02:46:03.820
F you to my friend for bricking his PSP, he deserved it, and a continuing F you to my

02:46:03.820 --> 02:46:05.320
online math class.

02:46:05.320 --> 02:46:08.160
A three out of ten for Weheart Katamari?

02:46:08.160 --> 02:46:10.520
That's just stupid.

02:46:10.520 --> 02:46:16.120
I know. Don't watch that show. Just don't watch it and then he won't get to give reviews.

02:46:16.120 --> 02:46:20.120
Listen to our show and tell people that we should be on TV.

02:46:20.120 --> 02:46:24.120
Vote us for president and give us money.

02:46:24.120 --> 02:46:28.620
Listen to Zaku who says, F you to death for taking Captain Jack from this earth on Friday.

02:46:28.620 --> 02:46:32.720
F you to still being single. F you to this nagging stuff he knows I've been having these days.

02:46:32.720 --> 02:46:38.160
One that I'm getting flack from one of my professors since she's saying I'm trying to get her sick.

02:46:38.160 --> 02:46:42.680
Sephiroth1215 says, F you to Funimation for butchering Dragon Ball Z, still,

02:46:42.680 --> 02:46:53.640
because even if I play Budokai Tenkashi, it still says H-I-F-L instead of Hell and Hercule instead of Mr. Satan.

02:46:53.640 --> 02:47:01.680
The game is rated Teen, you don't need to do that. In fact, you don't even need to do that with an E-rated game.

02:47:01.680 --> 02:47:05.380
Raaz says, F you to old ladies coughing on me for an hour and a half.

02:47:05.380 --> 02:47:09.680
F you to the health teacher who accused me of plagiarism and then denied it like three days later.

02:47:10.680 --> 02:47:13.380
What is it about science teachers and assholes, them being assholes?

02:47:13.380 --> 02:47:14.880
In church, in general.

02:47:14.880 --> 02:47:15.380
I'm kidding.

02:47:15.380 --> 02:47:20.180
Ronchan says, to go along with Loki, a massive F you to people who take clothes out of the laundry machines.

02:47:20.180 --> 02:47:22.080
No one told you to touch my clothes, okay?

02:47:22.080 --> 02:47:24.780
You can wait five fucking minutes till I walk back into the laundromat.

02:47:24.780 --> 02:47:28.780
And on behalf of the chat room, F you to Sakurina for talking smack about Captain Jack.

02:47:31.780 --> 02:47:35.780
Lego Freak says F you to every girl, why don't they like me?

02:47:37.780 --> 02:47:44.780
And then lastly, Dirty Thief says F you to my friend who hit me in the crotch with a shoe twice in one day.

02:47:48.780 --> 02:47:50.780
That sounds pretty hot.

02:47:50.780 --> 02:48:04.780
You know, though, that is a segment in, you know, that America's Funniest Home Videos that's so way overdone, that they always have those videos of people getting hit in the crotch, and, like, they're not funny.

02:48:04.780 --> 02:48:10.780
They're not funny. They're, like, they're totally, like, insanely not funny. Insanely not.

02:48:10.780 --> 02:48:18.780
You know what I saw on a sale for a DVD is, like, frickin' America's Funniest Home Videos, like, an entire season on DVD, and I was like, why would you buy this? Why?

02:48:18.780 --> 02:48:24.660
I know they show it on PAX TV or like all those other channels TNT. Is it on ABC?

02:48:24.660 --> 02:48:28.580
I think they still still hosted by Tom Bergeron now or whatever

02:48:28.580 --> 02:48:32.620
Yeah, the guy that was on Hollywood Squares better than Bob Sagar Hollywood Squares still on I

02:48:33.340 --> 02:48:40.280
Don't think so. Well, that's too bad. Whoopi Goldberg was a cool Center Square. It's thought I'd share really like her not really

02:48:40.280 --> 02:48:50.880
Anyway, what we're going to do now, I think we'll go to a quick break, and then when we

02:48:50.880 --> 02:48:54.320
come back, maybe Ask Orange Lounge for a little bit?

02:48:54.320 --> 02:48:55.320
Ask Extifer?

02:48:55.320 --> 02:48:56.320
Ask me anything.

02:48:56.320 --> 02:48:57.320
All right, anything.

02:48:57.320 --> 02:49:01.000
All right, ask us anything, and we'll be back after this.

02:49:01.000 --> 02:49:05.040
We're going to do a really quick, quick break here to give you guys a chance to send us

02:49:05.040 --> 02:49:07.760
in some questions for Ask Orange Lounge.

02:49:07.760 --> 02:49:11.480
have been begging for this song all night so I definitely have to indulge

02:49:11.480 --> 02:49:15.960
our chat room with this because I live for our chat room. We'll be back after

02:49:15.960 --> 02:49:22.960
with more Orange Lounge Radio and Ask Orange Lounge. Get your questions in now.

02:49:45.960 --> 02:50:03.960
Oh, one more time, I'm back with a new rhyme Hey, here we go again, turn it up my friend

02:50:03.960 --> 02:50:09.960
No, we don't stop talking, we rock the spot No, we don't quit, get failure, this is it

02:50:09.960 --> 02:50:11.960
Do you like to say maybe do you like to scream?

02:50:11.960 --> 02:50:13.960
Hey I like to dream, baby

02:50:13.960 --> 02:50:15.960
Do you like to dream oh

02:50:15.960 --> 02:50:17.960
I like to dream mama do you like to scream?

02:50:17.960 --> 02:50:19.960
Hey I like to scream baby

02:50:19.960 --> 02:50:21.960
Do you like to scream

02:50:21.960 --> 02:50:23.960
Oh so scream it out

02:50:23.960 --> 02:50:25.960
Scream out, scream out

02:50:25.960 --> 02:50:49.960
And just so you guys know, the only thing better than dream a dream is more dream a

02:50:49.960 --> 02:50:56.960
a dream.

02:51:19.960 --> 02:51:24.960
I'm back with a new rhyme, hey! Here we go again, turn it up my friends, go!

02:51:24.960 --> 02:51:29.960
We don't stop, we rock the spot, go! We don't quit, you feel your innocence

02:51:29.960 --> 02:51:33.960
Do you like to dream? Hey! I like to dream, baby

02:51:33.960 --> 02:51:36.960
Do you like to dream? Whoa! I like to dream, mommy

02:51:36.960 --> 02:51:39.960
Do you like to scream? Hey! I like to scream, baby

02:51:39.960 --> 02:51:42.960
Do you like to scream? Oh! So scream it out

02:51:42.960 --> 02:51:45.960
Scream out, dream up, a tip it in your ear

02:52:15.960 --> 02:52:21.960
You gotta, you gotta, you gotta, you gotta, you gotta, you gotta, you gotta, you gotta dream a little dream.

02:52:21.960 --> 02:52:23.960
Orange Lounge Radio,

02:52:23.960 --> 02:52:25.960
Bahmani Music,

02:52:25.960 --> 02:52:27.960
and more.

02:52:27.960 --> 02:52:29.960
Perfect!

02:52:33.960 --> 02:52:35.960
Let's ask Orange Lounge,

02:52:35.960 --> 02:52:37.960
some stupid question,

02:52:37.960 --> 02:52:40.960
what will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?

02:52:40.960 --> 02:52:42.960
I'm curious to see if

02:52:42.960 --> 02:52:47.600
actually got any questions but it would be nice to he would stop talking about

02:52:47.600 --> 02:52:54.880
Madonna for once that was a laughing riot there sure everybody just dropped

02:52:54.880 --> 02:53:03.880
everything they did floating laughter uh Renee wants to know what will it take to

02:53:03.880 --> 02:53:09.160
get MIDI head on the show and sky mr. Maury Povich would like to know are you

02:53:09.160 --> 02:53:12.920
the father

02:53:12.920 --> 02:53:16.160
the last time i had sex with a woman

02:53:16.160 --> 02:53:18.160
nevermind

02:53:18.160 --> 02:53:19.600
it was a kid

02:53:19.600 --> 02:53:22.600
what what would it take to get many head on the show probably if we just ask

02:53:22.600 --> 02:53:25.720
really nicely and we do want to get him on the show sometime around the release

02:53:25.720 --> 02:53:27.280
time of ultra mix three so

02:53:27.280 --> 02:53:30.880
i look forward to it i'm sure he'll do it now we just have to ask really nicely

02:53:30.880 --> 02:53:31.840
so we will

02:53:31.840 --> 02:53:34.720
we'll have our people talk to his people what you guys know

02:53:34.720 --> 02:53:37.380
uh... we also want to know

02:53:37.380 --> 02:53:42.380
Is that promo with something-something making Captain Jack cry getting retired?

02:53:42.380 --> 02:53:45.480
Um, we don't know yet. We think so.

02:53:45.480 --> 02:53:49.120
But we definitely don't want to retire Copy Kill's music, because that thing's awesome.

02:53:49.120 --> 02:53:54.040
Um, but as far as the promo, you know what, all of our old promos really need to be retired,

02:53:54.040 --> 02:53:55.740
but we're just too lazy to make new ones.

02:53:55.740 --> 02:53:59.800
Maybe we should have a promo-making contest. Maybe that's how we could get rid of this, uh,

02:53:59.800 --> 02:54:02.100
DDR Extreme 2. I wonder if people would do it.

02:54:02.100 --> 02:54:07.800
I didn't know, Charum, would you guys make us promos if we gave away an Extreme 2 bundle?

02:54:07.800 --> 02:54:10.600
An official Konami soft pad?

02:54:10.600 --> 02:54:13.200
That might be cool.

02:54:13.200 --> 02:54:19.200
Let's get to some more questions.

02:54:19.200 --> 02:54:24.820
Sakurina wants to know, is 69 easier with a hard-on?

02:54:24.820 --> 02:54:26.340
Of course it is.

02:54:26.340 --> 02:54:29.380
I think that's... If you don't have one,

02:54:29.380 --> 02:54:34.260
Why are you doing the 69? Right, I mean, you don't necessarily fall asleep when you're

02:54:34.260 --> 02:54:38.100
doing the 69. Well, if you're a girl, though, you wouldn't have a hard-on, and then 69 would

02:54:38.100 --> 02:54:42.460
be just fine. That's true, that's true. Yeah, you wouldn't do that to a vagina. I mean,

02:54:42.460 --> 02:54:50.540
vaginas don't get hard, so, no. But I appreciate the question, and yes, my advice would be

02:54:50.540 --> 02:54:56.980
that you have a hard-on when you do a 69. Legend of Zaku is wondering aloud in a question,

02:54:56.980 --> 02:55:01.360
Are they going to bury Captain Jack in his trademark uniform?

02:55:01.360 --> 02:55:07.460
You always know there's got to be somebody thinking I'm morbid.

02:55:07.460 --> 02:55:09.920
If I were Captain Jack, I would want to be buried in the uniform.

02:55:09.920 --> 02:55:11.940
I think they have to.

02:55:11.940 --> 02:55:14.380
Where was he not in that uniform, honestly?

02:55:14.380 --> 02:55:18.580
I think they should.

02:55:18.580 --> 02:55:22.500
I love how everybody gets so mad when people ask me questions.

02:55:22.500 --> 02:55:25.980
Like I'm going to take offense or something.

02:55:25.980 --> 02:55:30.980
NintendoManiac64 wants to know, why am I eating Cheddar Chex Mix instead of Ranch Doritos?

02:55:30.980 --> 02:55:32.980
Because it's less fattening? I don't know.

02:55:32.980 --> 02:55:36.980
Why are none of the awesome Mario Kart 64 tracks a Mario Kart DS?

02:55:36.980 --> 02:55:41.980
Because Nintendo will release Mario Kart DS Extreme or something that has the extra tracks in it later.

02:55:41.980 --> 02:55:44.980
Has Mario Kart DS even come out yet? No.

02:55:44.980 --> 02:55:50.980
How do you know they're not unlockables?

02:55:50.980 --> 02:55:55.140
So, Loki, what did you exactly do with my foot last night?

02:55:55.140 --> 02:55:57.340
Everyone in chat wants to hear your sick, perverted, gay thoughts.

02:55:57.340 --> 02:55:58.980
I have no idea what he's saying.

02:55:58.980 --> 02:56:01.460
That was like an hour ago on the show, I don't even remember.

02:56:01.460 --> 02:56:03.340
I wasn't even paying attention then.

02:56:03.340 --> 02:56:04.340
Oh well.

02:56:04.340 --> 02:56:08.780
Will any of you guys or chat room folks go to, beep, somebody's trying to hoard their

02:56:08.780 --> 02:56:10.780
website once it's complete.

02:56:10.780 --> 02:56:13.860
Yes, complete it, and then we'll say the website.

02:56:13.860 --> 02:56:15.460
I haven't even visited yet.

02:56:15.460 --> 02:56:16.460
I'll visit it.

02:56:16.460 --> 02:56:20.460
Send me an email, ask me really nicely, I'll visit it and give you my opinion.

02:56:21.460 --> 02:56:24.540
illusion wants to know now what's it all about Alfie

02:56:25.780 --> 02:56:29.100
Seeing a good movie for a change would be my answer a movie you

02:56:30.820 --> 02:56:32.900
Yeah, Alfie sucked

02:56:35.580 --> 02:56:37.580
It's lame that's all you need to know

02:56:38.700 --> 02:56:42.940
Lego freak wants to know hey, buddy. Can I have a hundred dollars wink wink a nudge nudge?

02:56:42.940 --> 02:57:06.140
One day when we're rich and famous, we'll give away cash and fabulous prizes on the

02:57:06.140 --> 02:57:09.380
show, and we'll remember your support.

02:57:09.380 --> 02:57:13.580
Kago wants to know, after no field trips the past three years, I have two coming up in

02:57:13.580 --> 02:57:19.060
the next two weeks. Should I go on both and risk missing work, or only go on one and get

02:57:19.060 --> 02:57:21.740
all my work done? It kind of depends where you're going.

02:57:21.740 --> 02:57:25.580
Yeah, are you going to the pumpkin patch? Yeah, if you're going to the pumpkin patch,

02:57:25.580 --> 02:57:28.020
fuck that shit, you don't need to go to the pumpkin patch.

02:57:28.020 --> 02:57:34.020
But if you're going to like, I don't know, Hooters, then go.

02:57:34.020 --> 02:57:42.980
I mean, if it's to Canada, I would go to Canada at a field trip.

02:57:42.980 --> 02:57:43.980
Let's see.

02:57:43.980 --> 02:57:57.620
Duran wants to know, I need an NES, can I have yours?

02:57:57.620 --> 02:57:58.980
My NES is broken.

02:57:58.980 --> 02:58:04.480
I mean, it won't even play the cartridges after I, like, blow on them like there's no tomorrow.

02:58:04.480 --> 02:58:05.480
Extra shut up.

02:58:06.480 --> 02:58:11.980
My NES just don't work no more, so if you want a broken paperweight, I guess you could have that.

02:58:13.980 --> 02:58:16.480
No one ever asks me any questions.

02:58:17.480 --> 02:58:19.480
Well, you want to give your NES to Duran?

02:58:20.480 --> 02:58:25.480
No, I actually have the one that top loads, if you remember that.

02:58:25.480 --> 02:58:26.480
Oh, lucky you.

02:58:26.480 --> 02:58:29.480
And I have the original as well, so...

02:58:30.480 --> 02:58:32.480
Yes, they work, and no, you can't have them.

02:58:33.480 --> 02:58:36.480
Otherwise, I can't play Guardian Legends, so there.

02:58:38.480 --> 02:58:41.480
Goggle wanted to clarify the two field trips.

02:58:41.480 --> 02:58:44.480
It's a museum on one day and a play on the other.

02:58:44.480 --> 02:58:46.480
Okay, I would go to the play.

02:58:46.480 --> 02:58:48.480
Well, I think both are worth it, and here's why.

02:58:48.480 --> 02:58:51.480
The museum, you're going to see nudity at the museum,

02:58:51.480 --> 02:58:53.480
because, like, you know, in classic arts, there's going to be nudity,

02:58:53.480 --> 02:58:56.560
be nudity and like in sculptures and stuff usually there's naked one or two

02:58:56.560 --> 02:59:00.840
like a butt. Autistic nudity is not that great. Yeah but it's nudity and then you

02:59:00.840 --> 02:59:03.760
should see the play because there's a chance of nudity depending on what the

02:59:03.760 --> 02:59:07.960
play is like if it's a little g-rated musical like The Lion King forget it but

02:59:07.960 --> 02:59:11.680
you know if it's something else like you know. You don't even have nudity I mean

02:59:11.680 --> 02:59:16.560
they if if they're wearing tights you're gonna see their package yeah so I mean

02:59:16.560 --> 02:59:21.320
you know if you see if you see penal structure behind that you know tight that

02:59:21.320 --> 02:59:26.320
Goggle, go where the nudity is. That's my advice, my sound advice to you.

02:59:26.320 --> 02:59:33.320
Alright, that's it. We're done. We're done with this show.

02:59:33.320 --> 02:59:35.320
Put the nail in the coffin of the show. We're done.

02:59:35.320 --> 02:59:38.320
I was pretty PG-13 tonight, wouldn't you say so, Rob Robert?

02:59:38.320 --> 02:59:42.320
You did a fairly good job, Extrofer Extroferson.

02:59:42.320 --> 02:59:45.320
Alright.

02:59:45.320 --> 02:59:49.320
I don't know what else to call you. You don't have a stage last name yet. You need one.

02:59:49.320 --> 02:59:51.600
it's going to be extra for

02:59:51.600 --> 02:59:53.760
and and it's going to be on

02:59:53.760 --> 02:59:56.100
uh... the show tomorrow

02:59:56.100 --> 02:59:57.960
rob pitch michelle

02:59:57.960 --> 03:00:01.940
uh... listen to the rob robert show on wednesday it'll be a good time

03:00:01.940 --> 03:00:08.940
pitch of the real show so i forgot to talk about

03:00:08.940 --> 03:00:10.600
final thoughts

03:00:10.600 --> 03:00:15.140
angel your final thought

03:00:15.140 --> 03:00:17.540
I want to go home and play World of Warcraft.

03:00:17.540 --> 03:00:19.380
Oh!

03:00:19.380 --> 03:00:22.820
Extrovert, your final thought. Oh, I'm sorry.

03:00:22.820 --> 03:00:27.500
Oh, Addict? Well, that's reserved for Final Fantasy XI. I'll think of another word for World of Warcraft.

03:00:27.500 --> 03:00:30.620
Extrovert, your final thought.

03:00:30.620 --> 03:00:34.580
I want to go home and play World of Warcraft.

03:00:34.580 --> 03:00:40.460
Oh! But you're already home!

03:00:40.460 --> 03:00:44.920
He's going to come over to your house, and that will be like the worst thing ever.

03:00:44.920 --> 03:00:45.920
LOKI!

03:00:45.920 --> 03:00:46.920
Um...

03:00:46.920 --> 03:00:55.920
I hope this works and...

03:00:55.920 --> 03:00:56.920
It doesn't work.

03:00:56.920 --> 03:00:57.920
No, it doesn't.

03:00:57.920 --> 03:00:58.920
Okay.

03:00:58.920 --> 03:00:59.920
Son of a bitch.

03:00:59.920 --> 03:01:02.480
By the way, I'd just like to point out that we've actually been short two hosts tonight

03:01:02.480 --> 03:01:06.000
because Dark Sakura isn't here and Loki has just really not been involved in the show.

03:01:06.000 --> 03:01:09.040
He's been working on something for the site the whole night so he could care less about

03:01:09.040 --> 03:01:10.040
this show.

03:01:10.040 --> 03:01:12.500
I'm participating.

03:01:12.500 --> 03:01:18.280
low-key does not care about orange lounge people

03:01:18.280 --> 03:01:22.620
i got them hate p h p

03:01:22.620 --> 03:01:25.860
my final thought is i want to top loading any s now

03:01:25.860 --> 03:01:31.340
jealous i can bring mine over and you can play games to get to the chris

03:01:31.340 --> 03:01:34.920
uh... may or if it if you don't have to have a war and i just might

03:01:34.920 --> 03:01:36.500
okay

03:01:36.500 --> 03:01:41.280
why why is that game so so wonderful because it's kitty chris but if i mean

03:01:41.280 --> 03:01:44.240
And it was the fucking hardest game that I played when I played it.

03:01:44.240 --> 03:01:46.480
I beat it because I'm the shit.

03:01:46.480 --> 03:01:48.640
You are the shit.

03:01:48.640 --> 03:01:50.360
Keep going with that, Rob.

03:01:50.360 --> 03:01:54.760
But meanwhile, I still think that it was kind of difficult.

03:01:54.760 --> 03:01:58.120
Maybe it was just because I'm not video game prone or something.

03:01:58.120 --> 03:01:59.280
Maybe that's it.

03:01:59.280 --> 03:02:00.840
I beat Legend of Zelda.

03:02:00.840 --> 03:02:01.840
Good job.

03:02:01.840 --> 03:02:02.840
Oh, no problem.

03:02:02.840 --> 03:02:04.800
Did you beat the second quest, though?

03:02:04.800 --> 03:02:05.800
I did.

03:02:05.800 --> 03:02:06.800
I did beat it.

03:02:06.800 --> 03:02:07.800
Good job.

03:02:07.800 --> 03:02:08.800
Did you beat Zelda 2?

03:02:08.800 --> 03:02:10.200
I didn't.

03:02:10.200 --> 03:02:11.200
You suck!

03:02:11.200 --> 03:02:13.860
I know.

03:02:13.860 --> 03:02:16.700
Final word of the show, one word to sum it all up.

03:02:16.700 --> 03:02:17.700
Rob Roberts?

03:02:17.700 --> 03:02:18.700
No.

03:02:18.700 --> 03:02:19.700
Oh, do I get to get the final word?

03:02:19.700 --> 03:02:22.140
I believe you do, because you never do.

03:02:22.140 --> 03:02:23.540
I never do do the final word of the show.

03:02:23.540 --> 03:02:24.900
God dammit, do the final word of the show.

03:02:24.900 --> 03:02:28.540
Alright, here's the final word of tonight's show.

03:02:28.540 --> 03:02:33.320
Go left, go right, go pick up a step, go left, go right, go left.

03:02:33.320 --> 03:02:39.020

Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.

03:04:33.900 --> 03:04:59.620
Are you sad that DarkSakur wasn't here tonight?

03:04:59.620 --> 03:05:01.620
What do you have to say to our listeners?

03:05:01.620 --> 03:05:03.620
Are you going to tune in next week?

03:05:05.620 --> 03:05:07.620
Are you going to download our podcast?

03:05:10.620 --> 03:05:12.620
Are you going to say goodnight to the listeners?

03:05:13.620 --> 03:05:18.620
All right, tell them that they have to reconnect to the stream in 15 seconds after they get dumped

03:05:18.620 --> 03:05:22.820
get dumped so they can tune into our Bahmanian video game music program. Can you say all

03:05:22.820 --> 03:05:23.820
What?

03:05:23.820 --> 03:05:25.820
Oh
