[SPEAKER_06]: But we're not going to have a funeral tonight.

05:47.385 --> 05:48.246
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to have a funeral.

05:48.506 --> 05:50.368
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that's the Orange Lounge Radio way after all.

05:51.308 --> 05:54.351

[SPEAKER_06]: And of course some other Bomani news.

05:56.132 --> 05:58.774
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, the same crap you've come to know and love.

05:58.894 --> 06:00.555
[SPEAKER_06]: Because Captain Jack would have wanted it that way.

07:28.718 --> 07:32.420
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge Radio will not contain any of that in this episode.

07:32.740 --> 07:33.921

[SPEAKER_06]: You might know me as Sky.

08:26.334 --> 08:29.036
[SPEAKER_06]: Not joining us tonight is the lovely DarkSakura.

08:29.056 --> 08:30.016
[SPEAKER_06]: She has the night off.

08:30.976 --> 08:34.738
[SPEAKER_06]: But filling in instead is the one and only Xtifer.

08:35.099 --> 08:35.659
[SPEAKER_06]: Yo, yo.

08:36.139 --> 08:39.341
[SPEAKER_06]: Who is promised to be at least PG-13 tonight?

08:40.341 --> 08:45.164
[SPEAKER_15]: I will only talk about, you know, the possible showing of boobs and ass.

08:45.384 --> 08:46.684
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, that's good.

08:47.025 --> 08:47.925
[SPEAKER_15]: Nothing else to promise.

08:48.085 --> 08:48.485
[SPEAKER_29]: Sounds good.

08:49.646 --> 08:52.527
[SPEAKER_29]: Also joining us, of course, the one and only Loki.

08:53.128 --> 08:53.628
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I'm here.

08:54.517 --> 08:54.977
[SPEAKER_06]: How you doing?

08:55.277 --> 08:55.478
[SPEAKER_06]: Good?

08:55.818 --> 08:55.978
[SPEAKER_06]: Good.

08:56.658 --> 08:56.959
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

08:57.319 --> 09:04.263
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, tonight, obviously, tonight's show is dedicated to the one and only Captain Jack, because he's the man.

09:04.823 --> 09:07.145
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll talk a little more about the captain when we come back.

09:07.485 --> 09:10.847
[SPEAKER_06]: But, of course, it's only appropriate that we play some Captain Jack songs tonight.

09:11.788 --> 09:17.231
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know how many we're going to play, but certainly through these first few breaks, we're going to pay some tribute to Captain Jack.

09:17.952 --> 09:19.813
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're going to start it off with one of my favorites.

09:19.893 --> 09:20.433
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the one.

09:20.773 --> 09:21.614
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember this song.

09:22.998 --> 09:25.657
[SPEAKER_06]: From DDR4th Mix, and it's the song that...

09:26.718 --> 09:30.379
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody, at least in this area, the Sacramento people, used to really get down to.

09:30.680 --> 09:32.280
[SPEAKER_06]: And, I mean, literally.

09:32.760 --> 09:35.541
[SPEAKER_06]: And it had such a fun little dance to it.

09:36.122 --> 09:41.384
[SPEAKER_06]: And people would kind of, the lyrics kind of have you sing along with it and do a little dance.

09:41.724 --> 09:44.405
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was really cheesy and we all looked drunk and stupid.

09:44.825 --> 09:47.406
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know what, Captain Jack songs were all about fun.

09:47.626 --> 09:50.307
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is one of the most fun songs I can think of.

09:50.327 --> 09:52.248
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're going to start off this break with Only You.

09:52.728 --> 09:55.089
[SPEAKER_06]: And we'll be back with more Orange Lounge Radio after this.

09:57.809 --> 10:04.739
[SPEAKER_11]: This is radio station CJ Boogie with a brand new world premiere song from Captain Jack, Only You.

11:20.202 --> 11:21.123
Thanks for watching!

12:42.697 --> 12:46.780
[SPEAKER_11]: Only you can make me feel so true I'll never, never be so blue As long as I have you

13:40.069 --> 13:41.730
[SPEAKER_09]: Celebrate Holiday Celebrate

16:30.825 --> 16:33.387
[SPEAKER_10]: The Step Squad to Orange Lab!

16:33.787 --> 16:35.669
[SPEAKER_10]: This PDR sucks!

16:35.749 --> 16:38.071
[SPEAKER_10]: Holla for the new level 7!

16:38.111 --> 16:38.371
[SPEAKER_09]: TTPO!

16:44.824 --> 16:45.505
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome back, kids.

16:45.725 --> 16:48.228
[SPEAKER_06]: We're here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 161.

16:48.308 --> 16:54.435
[SPEAKER_06]: In that break, we heard Only You by Captain Jack from DDR4thMix and Captain Jack with Holiday, the radio mix.

16:55.116 --> 16:59.581
[SPEAKER_06]: Tonight, of course, we played a couple of long versions there, which we don't usually do during our breaks.

16:59.761 --> 17:02.844
[SPEAKER_06]: But tonight, I think we have an excuse to be a little bit different.

17:03.005 --> 17:03.705
[SPEAKER_06]: So there you have it.

17:04.726 --> 17:19.660
[SPEAKER_06]: I promised our chat room, which by the way is swinging tonight over at www.orangeloungeradio.com clicking on chat, I promised them that we would have a major announcement regarding interactivity and the show a little bit before the program started and I'm going to reveal that right now.

17:21.089 --> 17:21.890
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's the big news.

17:23.411 --> 17:29.215
[SPEAKER_06]: As you know, we have the Skype line that allows you to contact us and we can talk to you on air.

17:30.256 --> 17:34.319
[SPEAKER_06]: But sometimes we have a lot of problems with the Skype line with people being able to talk to us.

17:34.759 --> 17:36.420
[SPEAKER_06]: They can't hear us or we can't hear them.

17:36.801 --> 17:39.963
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's the internet lag or something's going on, so it acts really funny.

17:41.084 --> 17:43.706
[SPEAKER_06]: So what we've done... Excuse me.

17:44.166 --> 17:44.246
[SPEAKER_06]: Ah.

17:46.161 --> 17:48.383
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm burping here because I just had Sprite during the break.

17:48.863 --> 17:49.664
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't choke, Rob.

17:50.164 --> 17:52.326
[SPEAKER_06]: The worst is McDonald's french fries burped there.

17:52.346 --> 18:01.192
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, so what we did is we've actually purchased an add-on to Skype that will allow you to call us on a regular telephone and say hello to us.

18:01.632 --> 18:02.713
[SPEAKER_06]: So here's the thing, though.

18:02.913 --> 18:07.777
[SPEAKER_06]: Not only is it a regular phone so you can give us a call and talk to us, but it's also a message line.

18:08.297 --> 18:12.280
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you want to call and leave us a message at any time, you can, and we can play that on the show.

18:12.380 --> 18:12.861
[SPEAKER_06]: So we thought...

18:13.806 --> 18:23.512
[SPEAKER_06]: With the news regarding Captain Jack, and I'm sure a lot of people have something they want to say, we thought we could open up this brand new thing and allow you guys to call in right now, leave some messages, and we'll play them later in the show.

18:23.952 --> 18:31.317
[SPEAKER_06]: But of course, now guys, try to keep it, you know, it is a three hour show, so we're kind of looking for, you know, what's your feedback on how

18:32.357 --> 18:32.958
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

18:51.129 --> 18:52.830
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for watching.

19:16.963 --> 19:18.866
[SPEAKER_06]: So you don't just have to have Skype to call in.

19:18.886 --> 19:24.392
[SPEAKER_06]: You can actually call us using a regular telephone as long as you're cool with paying long distance charges.

19:24.653 --> 19:26.876
[SPEAKER_06]: Or use a cell phone because you've got all those minutes.

19:27.396 --> 19:28.157
[SPEAKER_06]: Free long distance.

19:28.197 --> 19:28.578
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

19:30.961 --> 19:33.524
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, so once again, the phone number, area code 916-226-9067.

19:38.397 --> 19:40.218
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm putting that in chat right now.

19:40.238 --> 19:42.178
[SPEAKER_06]: 916-226-9067.

19:43.259 --> 19:52.001
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, before we get into how was your week, how was your day, obviously the big pink elephant sitting in the room right now is Extifer.

19:52.181 --> 19:53.962
[SPEAKER_06]: No, is the fact that...

19:55.780 --> 20:00.823
[SPEAKER_06]: Captain Jack obviously passed away this week, which, you know, sucks.

20:02.404 --> 20:03.185
[SPEAKER_06]: How else do you say it?

20:03.245 --> 20:03.685
[SPEAKER_06]: It sucks.

20:04.406 --> 20:18.334
[SPEAKER_06]: He suffered a second stroke, apparently he had a stroke a couple years ago, and he had a second stroke, and when he suffered the second stroke, apparently he was at a party in full uniform, because I don't think a picture of Captain Jack exists where he was not in his full uniform, which is part of what made him so awesome.

20:19.443 --> 20:20.844
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

20:41.101 --> 20:43.763
[SPEAKER_06]: So anyway, I thought maybe we could go around before we do a little bit.

20:43.783 --> 20:44.184
[SPEAKER_06]: How was your week?

20:44.204 --> 20:44.784
[SPEAKER_06]: How was your day?

20:45.024 --> 20:47.226
[SPEAKER_06]: And what do you think about all that?

20:47.246 --> 20:48.467
[SPEAKER_06]: What did you think of Captain Jack?

20:48.487 --> 20:50.169
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think about Captain Jack and DDR?

20:50.469 --> 20:51.490
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think about the music?

20:52.951 --> 20:54.012
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything you guys want to say?

20:54.392 --> 20:55.974
[SPEAKER_06]: And we'll start it off with Loki.

20:57.780 --> 21:15.884
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, well, I was surprised to hear they'd passed away, um, because I remember the whole morning I was trying to see what his condition was, and a lot of people were, because they were getting sources from, like, a German site, so translating German, we weren't sure if it was, you know, still in coma, or passed away, or just like, you know.

21:16.264 --> 21:23.806
[SPEAKER_06]: So once he figured it out, you know, and the news hit everybody, um, you know, it was, you know, very surprising, that's for sure.

21:24.326 --> 21:25.226
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, the guy's

21:26.334 --> 21:53.506
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, I wasn't a particular fan of his music, I mean, he was in the category of songs that are quite annoying to be played over and over and over in DDR, so it wasn't bad, but it wasn't, you know, he wasn't as horrible as, say, like, you know, DJ Alligator or something like that, so it was still fun, his songs were fun, and he just, I mean, he's definitely stayed true to himself, I mean, he's just very, you know, out there, you know, not...

21:54.454 --> 21:55.135
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for watching!

22:18.283 --> 22:19.504
[SPEAKER_06]: Angel, anything you want to say about it?

22:19.524 --> 22:21.044
[SPEAKER_06]: Angel, anything you want to say about it?

22:48.584 --> 22:50.826
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm not quite sure on that, but I think so.

22:51.106 --> 22:57.691
[SPEAKER_26]: So, that's the first time that I ever played one of his songs, and, you know, I still like him, and, you know, good stuff.

22:58.612 --> 23:01.634
[SPEAKER_26]: And I'm sorry to hear that he did pass away this week.

23:02.134 --> 23:03.255
[SPEAKER_26]: That was kind of a shocker.

23:03.315 --> 23:11.601
[SPEAKER_26]: Actually, DJ Ranma S, one of our buddies, told me on AIM, we were, like, talking and stuff, and he was like, hey, did you hear him?

23:11.621 --> 23:12.062
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm like, what?

23:12.082 --> 23:12.942
[SPEAKER_26]: Huh?

23:13.262 --> 23:17.986
[SPEAKER_26]: So he, like, linked me to it, to the website that was announcing that he was in a coma and stuff, and

23:18.556 --> 23:19.277
[SPEAKER_26]: It's just sad.

23:20.538 --> 23:20.798
[SPEAKER_26]: Sad.

23:21.399 --> 23:21.639
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay.

23:22.239 --> 23:22.780
[SPEAKER_26]: I'll shut up now.

23:25.537 --> 23:39.426
[SPEAKER_06]: I kind of see Captain Jack as one of the three big artists in the beginnings of DDR, the other two being SmileDK and Erotic, because those three bands kind of showed up in every early mix and continue to show up in a lot of DDR mixes today.

23:40.667 --> 23:49.092
[SPEAKER_06]: And where SmileDK is kind of bubblegum pop girl stuff and Erotic is... I don't know what the hell you call Erotic.

23:49.613 --> 23:51.414
[SPEAKER_06]: Captain Jack is quite simply the shit.

23:51.954 --> 23:52.795
[SPEAKER_06]: Captain Jack is the shit.

23:52.995 --> 23:53.495
[SPEAKER_06]: He's the man.

23:55.797 --> 24:19.998
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, a little bit eccentric, yes, but that's cool, because his music was just a lot of dumb fun, and I know, and that's kind of what DDR is all about, DDR is kind of dumb fun, and so Captain Jack, you know, he just wants to be surrounded by hot bitches and dance, that's really what Captain Jack was all about, was hot bitches and dancing, and, you know, I think that's awesome, and

24:21.300 --> 24:25.123
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just what DDR is all about, is having fun, and I think that's what Captain Jack's music was all about, is fun.

24:25.443 --> 24:26.504
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it ever going to win a Grammy?

24:26.584 --> 24:26.825
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

24:27.245 --> 24:31.328
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it, you know, the Oscar-winning soundtrack music?

24:31.428 --> 24:31.728
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

24:31.949 --> 24:34.411
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it even critically acclaimed ever?

24:34.531 --> 24:34.731
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

24:34.831 --> 24:40.776
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just, it's fun, mindless, happy, bouncy music, and that's what DDR is all about.

24:41.596 --> 24:42.657
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's why Captain Jack's the man.

24:43.198 --> 24:50.984
[SPEAKER_26]: What made it ironic about the whole thing was last week when I, after the show, I decided to go out in the living room

24:51.912 --> 24:55.535
[SPEAKER_26]: and, uh, play, uh, EX2 for the first time.

24:56.556 --> 25:05.283
[SPEAKER_26]: And, uh, the song that's on there was one of the first ones I actually played, so hearing what happened, you know, earlier this week, I was like, what?

25:06.404 --> 25:12.469
[SPEAKER_26]: So, I don't know, it's just kind of, kind of, uh, well, yeah, like I said, ironic, so, I don't know.

25:13.249 --> 25:13.770
[SPEAKER_26]: It was just weird.

25:13.790 --> 25:14.751
[SPEAKER_26]: It's like, wait.

25:14.771 --> 25:14.971
[SPEAKER_26]: Wait.

25:16.667 --> 25:20.829
[SPEAKER_06]: XFR, I would ask you, but I know you don't play enough DDR to probably even know who Captain Jack is.

25:20.849 --> 25:21.729
[SPEAKER_06]: The guy that died?

25:21.749 --> 25:22.950
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm guessing.

25:23.070 --> 25:24.471
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, he is the guy that died this week.

25:24.511 --> 25:25.671
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, okay.

25:26.111 --> 25:26.992
[SPEAKER_15]: My condolences.

25:27.352 --> 25:28.312
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

25:29.153 --> 25:35.255
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's pretty interesting how the Bumani community and the music gaming community in general has kind of been responding.

25:35.596 --> 25:45.140
[SPEAKER_06]: I know the article that Loki posted on it, I don't know if it made the runarounds and blogs and stuff, but the story about Captain Jack's passing has had more hits than...

25:45.760 --> 25:46.460
[SPEAKER_06]: and many more.

26:07.822 --> 26:10.104
[SPEAKER_06]: And another thing I could point out is, you know, you often wonder

26:35.883 --> 26:40.185
[SPEAKER_26]: If I ever pass away, will people find out about it and stuff like that?

26:40.465 --> 26:45.307
[SPEAKER_26]: I wonder if he wondered the same thing, because now look at the response after he passed away and stuff.

26:45.367 --> 26:47.788
[SPEAKER_26]: Kind of interesting.

26:47.848 --> 26:54.111
[SPEAKER_06]: I bet no record company here in this country had any idea how big of a following Captain Jack really had in this country.

26:54.971 --> 26:56.252
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of amazing.

26:59.073 --> 26:59.853
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what else to say.

26:59.953 --> 27:04.455
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to turn this into a three-hour sobfest, because honestly, that's not what Captain Jack was all about.

27:05.798 --> 27:08.480
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, he wants us to party, so let's like...

27:19.406 --> 27:20.807
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, hot female dogs.

27:20.967 --> 27:21.448
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, cool.

27:21.488 --> 27:21.888
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah.

27:23.229 --> 27:24.110
[SPEAKER_06]: Release the dogs.

27:24.530 --> 27:25.531
[SPEAKER_26]: Release the hounds.

27:25.771 --> 27:37.341
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, again, if you want to call and leave a message on our message line, it's 916-226-9067 and we'll be playing some of your messages and your thoughts about Captain Jack a little later in the program.

27:40.063 --> 27:41.724
[SPEAKER_06]: What else did I want to say on the whole thing?

27:41.864 --> 27:52.190
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yes, of course, we had some requests if we could maybe play a little something and just kind of give Captain Jack an appropriate 21-gun salute.

27:53.290 --> 27:59.053
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're going to give Captain Jack a 21-gun salute, or somebody suggested in the chat room, actually, a 21-arrow salute.

28:00.114 --> 28:01.354
[SPEAKER_06]: So however you want to...

28:02.819 --> 28:03.339
[SPEAKER_06]: Imagine it.

28:03.799 --> 28:08.321
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to give Captain Jack a moment of silence, an Orange Launch Radio moment of silence, and a 21-gun salute.

28:08.381 --> 28:11.883
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you would all please, a moment of silence and a salute.

28:47.202 --> 28:55.209
[SPEAKER_06]: and to that you know Captain Jack would have followed up with GO LEFT GO RIGHT GO RIGHT GO LEFT GO LEFT GO LEFT GO RIGHT GO LEFT

29:08.316 --> 29:11.238
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's get into Orange Lounge Radio and what we're all about.

29:11.378 --> 29:13.879
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello kids who are listening to us, maybe for the first time.

29:14.859 --> 29:21.782
[SPEAKER_06]: We're a radio program about the music games and video gaming in general, but sometimes we like to talk about ourselves.

29:21.822 --> 29:25.184
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of like imagine if you were going out to Denny's after the football game.

29:26.084 --> 29:28.585
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure, you talk about the football game a little bit, but you talk about other stuff too.

29:28.765 --> 29:31.286
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's what we're all about here at Orange Lounge, just sitting around having a good time.

29:31.727 --> 29:34.888
[SPEAKER_06]: So one way we just kind of do that is by talking about our weeks and our days.

29:35.368 --> 29:38.770
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're going to talk about your week and your day and what's been up and what's been going on.

29:38.790 --> 29:42.912
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll start off tonight with DDR Angel, if you wouldn't mind starting us off with how was your week, how was your day?

29:43.272 --> 29:45.154
[SPEAKER_26]: Sure, that's not a problem.

29:45.414 --> 29:45.614
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah.

29:46.414 --> 29:48.996
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, the week was alright.

29:49.216 --> 29:55.159
[SPEAKER_26]: I spent Monday and Tuesday kind of trying to get my computer back online and stuff like that.

29:55.179 --> 30:02.803
[SPEAKER_26]: I finally got to that point at early Wednesday morning before class.

30:03.123 --> 30:03.844
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay.

30:04.518 --> 30:09.840
[SPEAKER_26]: and so that's all fine and good now and I can finally play all the games that I want to play.

30:10.160 --> 30:19.323
[SPEAKER_26]: Today was pretty much spent catching up on World of Warcraft because I hadn't done it all week thanks to said computer.

30:20.604 --> 30:23.945
[SPEAKER_26]: Other than that I picked up EX2 this week.

30:23.965 --> 30:28.507
[SPEAKER_26]: I haven't gotten to play it yet but I shall get to that shortly.

30:30.583 --> 30:32.605
[SPEAKER_26]: Other than that, it's been a really quiet week.

30:33.186 --> 30:44.898
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, I picked up a, um, people are going to shoot me for this, but I ended up going to the bookstore and stumbling upon a Warcraft manga.

30:47.696 --> 30:48.197
[SPEAKER_06]: Nerd!

30:49.297 --> 30:49.798
[SPEAKER_26]: Nerd!

30:51.339 --> 30:53.480
[SPEAKER_06]: Fucking Warcraft manga, nerd!

30:54.140 --> 30:54.580
[SPEAKER_26]: Hey!

30:55.921 --> 30:58.523
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't know, I saw it and I was like, okay, um, mine.

30:58.983 --> 31:01.164
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's see, let's see the story.

31:01.525 --> 31:04.907
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see, the World of Warcraft, no, this isn't World of Warcraft, this is Warcraft.

31:04.947 --> 31:06.207
[SPEAKER_26]: Actually it is, I think.

31:06.628 --> 31:09.830
[SPEAKER_06]: World of Warcraft, the Sunwell Trilogy.

31:10.959 --> 31:16.121
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an epic quest to save the world of Azeroth from the forces of the Undead Scourge.

31:16.821 --> 31:32.427
[SPEAKER_06]: Warcraft, the Sunworld Trilogy, chronicles the adventures of Kalec, a blue dragon who has taken human form to investigate a mysterious power, and Anveena, a beautiful young maiden with an enchanting secret.

31:35.442 --> 31:38.624
[SPEAKER_26]: and volume number two will be out in March of 2006.

31:39.064 --> 31:41.026
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's a sex novel then, huh?

31:41.186 --> 31:42.407
[SPEAKER_18]: No, it's not a sex novel.

31:42.507 --> 31:42.827
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, okay.

31:43.047 --> 31:43.427
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh dear.

31:44.508 --> 31:45.489
[SPEAKER_26]: What did I walk into?

31:45.509 --> 31:46.189
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh wait.

31:47.450 --> 31:51.352
[SPEAKER_26]: Actually, yeah, so I bought that and he caught in a go.

31:52.679 --> 31:55.580
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, I bought all those too, but you probably don't know that.

31:55.720 --> 31:56.940
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, go read Shonen Jump.

31:56.980 --> 31:57.220
[SPEAKER_26]: Jeez.

31:59.641 --> 32:00.121
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay.

32:00.141 --> 32:02.541
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, well, it's in there.

32:02.601 --> 32:04.762
[SPEAKER_26]: Anyway, yeah, I bought manga this week.

32:04.902 --> 32:05.362
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, anyway.

32:05.382 --> 32:05.862
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all good.

32:05.962 --> 32:06.402
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all good.

32:07.062 --> 32:08.062
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever you're into.

32:08.302 --> 32:08.562
[SPEAKER_26]: What?

32:08.682 --> 32:15.444
[SPEAKER_26]: My Japanese side cries for books and stuff.

32:15.644 --> 32:15.924
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay.

32:17.324 --> 32:18.345
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't know.

32:18.785 --> 32:19.505
[SPEAKER_26]: I guess that's it.

32:20.445 --> 32:20.866
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

32:21.666 --> 32:22.587
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, how was your week?

32:22.607 --> 32:23.088
[SPEAKER_06]: How was your day?

32:25.750 --> 32:27.252
[SPEAKER_06]: My week was okay.

32:28.433 --> 32:33.978
[SPEAKER_06]: I played other games and worked on websites.

32:36.581 --> 32:37.361
[SPEAKER_06]: That's about it.

32:38.262 --> 32:39.343
[SPEAKER_06]: Ate steak today.

32:41.425 --> 32:41.806
[SPEAKER_06]: Steak.

32:42.046 --> 32:42.646
[SPEAKER_06]: What kind of steak?

32:45.629 --> 32:47.010
[SPEAKER_06]: How do you enjoy your slabs of meat?

32:47.030 --> 32:48.231
[SPEAKER_06]: Medium or medium rare.

32:48.311 --> 32:48.531
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

32:48.871 --> 32:49.091
[SPEAKER_06]: Me too.

32:49.151 --> 32:49.632
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways, so no, that

33:09.400 --> 33:11.941
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty much all I did was play the Warriors this week.

33:12.761 --> 33:13.741
[SPEAKER_06]: And I love that game.

33:14.021 --> 33:17.742
[SPEAKER_06]: There's nothing more fun than a game that starts off with beating up bums.

33:19.323 --> 33:21.043
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, hitting them with bricks and stuff.

33:21.083 --> 33:25.044
[SPEAKER_06]: And then they mug somebody by throwing a TV at their head and knocking them down and then stole their money.

33:25.645 --> 33:27.825
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just, that's great gameplay right there.

33:29.406 --> 33:30.046
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yep.

33:30.566 --> 33:31.146
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what happened.

33:32.166 --> 33:34.987
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, okay.

33:35.007 --> 33:36.008
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, well I guess that's it then.

33:36.128 --> 33:37.008
[SPEAKER_06]: Extrover, how was your week?

33:37.028 --> 33:37.408
[SPEAKER_06]: How was your day?

33:38.935 --> 33:39.816
[SPEAKER_06]: It was good.

33:40.436 --> 33:47.482
[SPEAKER_15]: I played a lot of World of Warcraft and I played some Final Fantasy XI.

33:50.965 --> 33:55.569
[SPEAKER_15]: My sister came over yesterday and hung out with me and you, Sky.

33:56.870 --> 34:03.095
[SPEAKER_15]: And we all hung out and stuff and ate at Claim Jumper, which is a popular restaurant over here.

34:04.896 --> 34:12.582
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, and today I kind of have, well, actually, you know, this week I've also been preparing for tomorrow's show.

34:14.823 --> 34:15.424
[SPEAKER_15]: Listen to it.

34:15.884 --> 34:16.444
[SPEAKER_15]: Starts tomorrow.

34:17.245 --> 34:17.805
[SPEAKER_15]: What's it called?

34:17.825 --> 34:18.446
[SPEAKER_15]: What time's it on?

34:18.486 --> 34:20.367
[SPEAKER_15]: Christopher's Case of the Monday starts at 7.

34:22.289 --> 34:23.549
[SPEAKER_15]: And, um... PST.

34:24.290 --> 34:25.091
[SPEAKER_15]: PST.

34:25.211 --> 34:27.873
[SPEAKER_15]: Meaning Pacific Standard Time, not Please Send Tell.

34:27.933 --> 34:29.053
[SPEAKER_15]: I know what it means.

34:30.434 --> 34:34.878
[SPEAKER_15]: So, you know, listen and stuff.

34:35.158 --> 34:37.239
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm planning on it lasting for two hours.

34:37.379 --> 34:38.060
[SPEAKER_15]: Who knows, though?

34:38.720 --> 34:39.941
[SPEAKER_15]: It may last less than that.

34:41.362 --> 34:44.044
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just planning on it being kind of like a fun, random show.

34:44.384 --> 34:45.085
[SPEAKER_15]: Start off your week.

34:46.126 --> 34:47.847
[SPEAKER_15]: And I love my intro song.

34:48.868 --> 34:49.508
[SPEAKER_15]: Love it, love it.

34:49.548 --> 34:50.589
[SPEAKER_15]: I can't stop talking about it.

34:50.609 --> 34:51.930
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm almost obsessed with it.

34:52.470 --> 34:54.031
[SPEAKER_06]: So are you going to be sad if no one listens?

34:56.373 --> 34:57.534
[SPEAKER_06]: No, yes.

34:57.974 --> 34:58.595
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, possibly.

34:59.295 --> 35:02.578
[SPEAKER_06]: I figure either way, no matter what, it's got to have higher ratings than Diversion did.

35:02.798 --> 35:09.063
[SPEAKER_15]: So... Well, just listen, give it a chance, be objective.

35:09.463 --> 35:10.544
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not going to be all sex.

35:11.565 --> 35:12.586
[SPEAKER_15]: It'll be more than that.

35:13.726 --> 35:21.292
[SPEAKER_15]: Although I'd enjoy if you'd just take off your pants when you listen to it.

35:21.353 --> 35:23.034
[SPEAKER_06]: Your mic is going on and off.

35:23.754 --> 35:24.635
[SPEAKER_06]: That cord sucks.

35:24.675 --> 35:25.596
[SPEAKER_06]: We have to get it replaced, so...

35:26.331 --> 35:27.232
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, well.

35:27.272 --> 35:27.613
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you there?

35:28.434 --> 35:28.814
[SPEAKER_15]: I think I am.

35:28.834 --> 35:29.435
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I can hear you.

35:29.515 --> 35:29.835
[SPEAKER_06]: Barely.

35:31.157 --> 35:32.578
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, use Loki's mic for now.

35:33.019 --> 35:33.419
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

35:34.000 --> 35:34.901
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a little clearer anyway.

35:36.182 --> 35:38.025
[SPEAKER_15]: So anyways, that's how my week and my day was.

35:38.926 --> 35:39.106
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

35:40.633 --> 35:41.334
[SPEAKER_06]: My week and my day.

35:41.394 --> 35:45.217
[SPEAKER_06]: I went to a party last night and I got slightly intoxicated.

35:46.998 --> 35:47.379
[SPEAKER_06]: Slightly.

35:48.059 --> 35:48.640
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm okay.

35:49.320 --> 35:51.142
[SPEAKER_06]: And remember kids, don't drink and drive.

35:51.362 --> 35:51.642
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't.

35:53.644 --> 35:58.147
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've been playing a lot of World of Warcraft myself this week, which I know makes me a huge-ass hypocrite.

35:59.548 --> 35:59.828
[SPEAKER_06]: But no.

36:00.949 --> 36:02.310
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't go by books, okay?

36:02.350 --> 36:03.290
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't go by the manga.

36:04.030 --> 36:04.850
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just kidding, I'm kidding.

36:05.171 --> 36:05.491
[SPEAKER_06]: It's cool.

36:06.631 --> 36:11.673
[SPEAKER_06]: But I've just been trying to get into it and seeing how I like it compared to the other MMOs out there.

36:12.253 --> 36:16.574
[SPEAKER_06]: And other than that, I haven't been doing a whole lot of things of interest.

36:17.775 --> 36:22.556
[SPEAKER_06]: I did watch the season premieres of South Park and Drawn Together, though, which were excellent.

36:23.657 --> 36:24.597
[SPEAKER_26]: We should have listened!

36:25.694 --> 36:26.636
[SPEAKER_26]: We should have listened!

36:27.298 --> 36:29.483
[SPEAKER_26]: Go around the ends and say trick or treat.

36:29.784 --> 36:31.147
[SPEAKER_26]: And you, like, get turned into stuff.

36:31.528 --> 36:32.691
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, I got turned into a ninja today.

36:32.872 --> 36:33.914
[SPEAKER_26]: I got turned into a bat.

36:33.974 --> 36:35.037
[SPEAKER_26]: That was kind of interesting.

36:35.717 --> 36:37.157
[SPEAKER_15]: I got turned into a skeleton.

36:37.518 --> 36:42.939
[SPEAKER_15]: Although I really think that the Halloween stuff in World of Warcraft is way better than Final Fantasy XI.

36:43.439 --> 36:45.740
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, I can't stand the Final Fantasy XI thing.

36:46.360 --> 36:46.960
[SPEAKER_15]: It just sucked.

36:47.380 --> 36:51.882
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to talk about this on the podcast a little later, but I don't want to compare Final Fantasy XI to World of Warcraft.

36:51.902 --> 36:52.722
[SPEAKER_06]: But you know what?

36:52.782 --> 36:55.443
[SPEAKER_15]: I can compare those two because they're both having Halloween events.

36:56.163 --> 36:56.723
[SPEAKER_15]: So, you know...

37:00.014 --> 37:01.695
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, that's fine.

37:02.455 --> 37:03.876
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, let's see.

37:03.916 --> 37:09.820
[SPEAKER_06]: I think what we'll do now is we're going to take a little bit of break, then we're going to come back and we're going to talk about some Bomani news, some things going on in the Bomani world.

37:10.260 --> 37:13.662
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's see, what do we want to do this break?

37:14.182 --> 37:20.265
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we'll do another Captain Jack song, although I think we'll keep it to shorter versions this time.

37:21.106 --> 37:24.908
[SPEAKER_06]: And we'll be back after this break with more Orange Lodge Radio.

37:24.948 --> 37:26.289
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't forget, you can call our message line.

37:26.309 --> 37:26.629
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to

37:27.009 --> 37:29.930
[SPEAKER_06]: Get into the message line in probably about another 30 minutes or so.

37:30.010 --> 37:32.472
[SPEAKER_06]: So make sure you get all your messages in about Captain Jack.

37:33.392 --> 37:37.834
[SPEAKER_06]: Area code 916-226-9067.

37:37.874 --> 37:40.135
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember, it's a three-hour show, so keep your messages short.

37:40.455 --> 37:42.536
[SPEAKER_06]: We can't guarantee we'll get to all the messages as well.

37:43.276 --> 37:44.597
[SPEAKER_06]: So just give it a call.

37:45.437 --> 37:48.659
[SPEAKER_06]: And we'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.

37:51.152 --> 37:51.732
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you ready?

37:51.752 --> 37:53.513
[SPEAKER_09]: Ready for the race?

37:53.653 --> 37:54.293
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you ready?

37:54.513 --> 37:55.894
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you ready?

37:56.594 --> 37:57.214
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you ready?

39:23.391 --> 39:24.374
[SPEAKER_10]: My Generation

40:47.230 --> 40:48.452
My Generation

Thanks for watching!

42:33.929 --> 42:35.999
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go

43:57.380 --> 43:59.702
[SPEAKER_09]: Go left, go right, go left, go left, go right, go left

44:17.179 --> 44:19.561
[SPEAKER_06]: We're back here on Orange Lounge Radio on this episode number 161.

44:20.042 --> 44:24.986
[SPEAKER_06]: A whole break there of Captain Jack songs from DDR because, of course, Captain Jack passed this past week.

44:25.707 --> 44:27.608
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're just kind of doing some tributes tonight.

44:27.728 --> 44:29.890
[SPEAKER_06]: Some songs there that you heard in that break, The Race.

44:30.011 --> 44:33.153
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a song that was in not only DDR third mix, but also a Beatmania song.

44:33.694 --> 44:34.535
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of a fun song there.

44:34.855 --> 44:41.401
[SPEAKER_06]: My Generation, which I believe was the first Captain Jack song to be in American DDR, I think.

44:42.301 --> 44:44.623
[SPEAKER_06]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

45:10.958 --> 45:14.762
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, of course, Captain Jack, which is kind of the song that everybody knows.

45:15.242 --> 45:17.043
[SPEAKER_06]: The actual song, Captain Jack, from 3rd Mix.

45:18.184 --> 45:19.265
[SPEAKER_06]: The song that has the F word in it.

45:19.726 --> 45:20.706
[SPEAKER_06]: I will be your fucking man.

45:21.207 --> 45:21.887
[SPEAKER_06]: At one point in there.

45:22.268 --> 45:22.608
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

45:22.628 --> 45:23.028
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

45:23.349 --> 45:24.209
[SPEAKER_06]: Lays down the smack there.

45:24.289 --> 45:25.310
[SPEAKER_06]: I will be your fucking man.

45:27.717 --> 45:29.018
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

45:50.033 --> 45:51.194
[SPEAKER_06]: and here's the catch.

45:51.854 --> 45:55.537
[SPEAKER_06]: Not only is it a copy of DDR Extreme 2, it's a bundle, kids.

45:55.637 --> 46:00.881
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a bundle pack, which means it has an official Konami soft pad bundled in with it.

46:00.941 --> 46:03.062
[SPEAKER_06]: And those things are not easy to get.

46:03.503 --> 46:06.425
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you want the best soft pad you can get,

46:07.065 --> 46:08.747
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to give you a chance to win it next week.

46:09.007 --> 46:10.649
[SPEAKER_06]: And a copy of DDR Extreme 2 as well.

46:10.989 --> 46:12.831
[SPEAKER_06]: And more details to come next week.

46:13.171 --> 46:14.233
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what we're going to do.

46:14.353 --> 46:15.894
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll have to think about that.

46:15.934 --> 46:18.277
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to boo about that over this next week.

46:18.377 --> 46:19.398
[SPEAKER_06]: So it'll be exciting.

46:19.418 --> 46:20.099
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're going to give that away.

46:23.129 --> 46:27.172
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, one more thing I want to point out is our message line.

46:27.212 --> 46:28.513
[SPEAKER_06]: We are taking messages right now.

46:28.573 --> 46:33.316
[SPEAKER_06]: If you have something you want to say about Captain Jack, area code 916-226-9067.

46:33.356 --> 46:36.639
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the brand new Orange Lounge Radio message line.

46:37.782 --> 46:38.983
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for watching!

46:55.370 --> 46:55.910
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

47:16.016 --> 47:16.696
[SPEAKER_06]: A podcast.

47:16.756 --> 47:20.137
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the new MIDI Head MP3 where he's teasing Ultramix 3.

47:20.457 --> 47:23.438
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm going to be downright honest, I haven't had time to listen to it yet.

47:23.938 --> 47:24.898
[SPEAKER_06]: I listened to part of it.

47:24.918 --> 47:25.178
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you?

47:25.218 --> 47:25.959
[SPEAKER_06]: What did you think?

47:25.999 --> 47:27.399
[SPEAKER_06]: What came up?

47:27.559 --> 47:30.440
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just as cool as most MIDI Head stuff.

47:30.840 --> 47:33.520
[SPEAKER_06]: Played some more tracks from his new album.

47:34.361 --> 47:34.521
[SPEAKER_06]: And...

47:36.161 --> 47:36.982
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just, it was good.

47:37.243 --> 47:42.128
[SPEAKER_06]: And he gave, he let us know what some of the artists are going to be on Ultramix 3.

47:42.229 --> 47:44.031
[SPEAKER_06]: Looks like quite a lineup, too.

47:44.251 --> 47:46.574
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's got a very interesting lineup in Ultramix 3.

47:46.954 --> 47:47.955
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see, I gotta head on over here to...

47:50.382 --> 47:58.489
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the websites here, because honestly, I've been a little bit disconnected from everything this week, so... I haven't really been reading what's going on.

47:58.809 --> 48:07.256
[SPEAKER_06]: I did hear, I heard some people bitching in the chatroom about Good Charlotte being in Ultramix 3, so I guess that news came out, that Good Charlotte's going to be in there.

48:07.276 --> 48:12.701
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I know, that's kind of an interesting addition, to say the least.

48:14.202 --> 48:14.322
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

48:15.103 --> 48:16.664
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, They Might Be Giants.

48:16.684 --> 48:27.211
[SPEAKER_06]: I think some folks in the thread there used screen captures from a screenshot that was released on the internet to figure out that the They Might Be Giants song we were supposed to be getting is Istanbul, not Constantinople.

48:27.492 --> 48:30.294
[SPEAKER_06]: Which actually makes me sad because I wanted the Tiny Toons video in it.

48:30.734 --> 48:33.396
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that would have been awesome if it was the Tiny Toons music video.

48:34.289 --> 48:34.929
[SPEAKER_06]: Moby

49:04.218 --> 49:04.999
[SPEAKER_06]: Black Eyed Peas

49:17.779 --> 49:19.600
[SPEAKER_06]: B-52s, that's pretty awesome.

49:19.620 --> 49:20.881
[SPEAKER_06]: The B-52s are awesome.

49:21.601 --> 49:24.602
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know which song it's going to be, but I'm... I hope they do Rome.

49:25.283 --> 49:28.184
[SPEAKER_06]: I liked Rome, but I'm kind of hoping for Rock Lobster a little bit.

49:28.584 --> 49:29.345
[SPEAKER_06]: Rock Lobster!

49:29.765 --> 49:32.146
[SPEAKER_15]: They always do Love Shack Rock Lobster.

49:32.646 --> 49:35.248
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll probably be Love Shack, but, you know.

49:36.288 --> 49:36.808
[SPEAKER_06]: What else is there?

49:36.828 --> 49:38.029
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see, we've got Basement Jacks.

49:38.369 --> 49:38.950
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty cool.

49:39.270 --> 49:39.850
[SPEAKER_06]: Basement Jacks.

49:40.950 --> 49:41.651
[SPEAKER_06]: No FX.

49:43.001 --> 49:44.563
[SPEAKER_06]: Blackalicious, Groove Armada, and Devo

50:00.748 --> 50:03.029
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like Myspace in the form of DDR.

50:26.952 --> 50:27.813
[SPEAKER_06]: It totally is.

50:28.293 --> 50:28.954
[SPEAKER_06]: It totally is.

50:29.014 --> 50:31.156
[SPEAKER_06]: Ultramix 3 is DDR Myspace mix.

50:33.318 --> 50:33.959
[SPEAKER_06]: That's great.

50:39.624 --> 50:46.070
[SPEAKER_06]: I wonder if next year when they do Ultramix 4, if they're going to go up to the 360 or if they're going to stay on the regular Xbox platform.

50:46.090 --> 50:46.831
[SPEAKER_06]: What's going to happen?

50:47.171 --> 50:47.832
[SPEAKER_06]: Should be interesting.

50:48.660 --> 50:51.605
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, we already know a bunch of other songs that are going to be in Ultra Mix 3 this year.

50:52.406 --> 50:58.236
[SPEAKER_06]: We have songs such as Spray doing I Am Gothic.

50:58.677 --> 51:00.480
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's kind of another borderline emo song.

51:03.171 --> 51:05.033
[SPEAKER_15]: They should have done the Kill With My Car song.

51:06.254 --> 51:20.985
[SPEAKER_06]: Raise Your Hands by Midihead, of course, Conflict by The Azoic, Basile by Orif Is, Drivin', Naoki featuring Politary, and Brilliant R.E.D., which is a brand new Naoki song, which one of the screenshots gave away that was posted by another website.

51:21.966 --> 51:26.350
[SPEAKER_06]: Love This Feelin', the Zonk remix by Akiriyama Oka, but remixed by Zonk.

51:26.810 --> 51:33.614
[SPEAKER_06]: JellyKiss, MidiHead, SmackMix HashTheSun, Shatonix Remix of Colors, MidiHead Remix of Bylalaki I Carried With The Wind Come With Me, Raindancer

51:51.724 --> 51:54.828
[SPEAKER_06]: and Together and Forever by Captain Jack, which I think is pretty cool.

51:54.888 --> 51:59.173
[SPEAKER_06]: So we do get a Captain Jack song in Ultramix 3, pretty appropriate at this point.

51:59.893 --> 52:01.776
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's what's going on with Ultramix 3.

52:06.793 --> 52:07.813
[SPEAKER_06]: should be an interesting mix.

52:08.434 --> 52:16.220
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, I think what we'll do now, why don't we go ahead and let's go over to the Orange Launch Radio message line and let's see what we got on our messages.

52:16.320 --> 52:19.422
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we'll actually open up the Skype line in a little bit to take calls.

52:19.742 --> 52:28.349
[SPEAKER_06]: And when we open up the Skype line to take live calls, you can either call us over the Skype line like you always do in the past, or you can just get on the phone and punch in the digits.

52:28.709 --> 52:31.131
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're going to load up and see what messages we got on the Skype line.

52:31.351 --> 52:32.652
[SPEAKER_06]: We wanted to see what people had to say about...

52:35.273 --> 52:40.977
[SPEAKER_06]: and of course this is a brand new thing kind of for us is this whole thing so this is very experimental so I'm not sure

52:42.660 --> 52:43.060
[SPEAKER_06]: He's your webmaster.

52:43.080 --> 52:43.681
[SPEAKER_06]: I like it.

53:12.276 --> 53:13.617
[SPEAKER_06]: Whoops, I think that was a test call.

53:15.258 --> 53:17.219
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's try this one instead.

53:18.899 --> 53:19.600
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, what's up?

53:19.660 --> 53:20.240
[SPEAKER_20]: It's the same.

53:20.860 --> 53:25.403
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, I don't know, this whole thing about Captain Jack is pretty crappy.

53:26.303 --> 53:27.724
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, I love the songs.

53:28.144 --> 53:31.046
[SPEAKER_20]: Good times at Third Mix playing Captain Jack on the standard.

53:31.906 --> 53:37.989
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, those were good times, but you know, it's terrible a guy like that has to mess away, so I don't know.

53:39.570 --> 53:41.271
[SPEAKER_20]: It just sucks, but

53:42.202 --> 53:43.884
[SPEAKER_20]: Captain Jack lives on in our hearts.

53:45.605 --> 53:51.712
[SPEAKER_20]: And did you also know Captain Jack, I was looking at pictures, he's a freaking pimp.

53:52.612 --> 53:54.474
[SPEAKER_20]: Captain Jack is the master pimp.

53:54.494 --> 53:57.938
[SPEAKER_20]: He had so many ladies, it was just awesome.

53:58.839 --> 54:02.602
[SPEAKER_20]: But, sucks about Captain Jack.

54:08.424 --> 54:11.205
[SPEAKER_06]: Captain Jack was all about the hot bitches, honestly.

54:12.266 --> 54:20.890
[SPEAKER_06]: You see these pictures, I mean, if you go to his official website, which I think is like CaptainJack.de or something like that, you go to his website, and in like half his picture galleries, he is surrounded by hot-ass bitches.

54:21.350 --> 54:24.672
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, what a fun guy.

54:25.092 --> 54:25.952
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go to another message.

54:26.012 --> 54:27.253
[SPEAKER_06]: He was a pimp, but in a good way.

54:28.534 --> 54:31.315
[SPEAKER_19]: Hey, just sitting here in my room, Nintendo Maniac 64.

54:31.755 --> 54:36.157
[SPEAKER_19]: Just testing out this new golf thingy.

54:37.238 --> 54:37.678
[SPEAKER_19]: Can't answer...

54:38.655 --> 54:40.335
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm in the living room, I'm just back in my room.

54:40.355 --> 54:43.236
[SPEAKER_19]: Supposed to be doing homework, but... You know what?

54:43.256 --> 54:44.416
[SPEAKER_19]: Screw you, homework!

54:44.656 --> 54:45.536
[SPEAKER_19]: Screw you!

54:46.216 --> 54:46.556
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

54:47.216 --> 54:48.457
[SPEAKER_19]: It really grinds like yours.

54:49.917 --> 54:51.737
[SPEAKER_19]: Like America does to Peter Griffin.

54:53.898 --> 54:56.538
[SPEAKER_19]: So... I think I'm getting Doritos and stuff.

54:56.798 --> 54:57.418
[SPEAKER_19]: Doritos are good.

54:57.618 --> 54:58.418
[SPEAKER_19]: Especially the ranch flavor.

54:58.438 --> 55:01.859
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm just watching movies that... Are you high?!

55:03.459 --> 55:04.219
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this guy high?!

55:04.239 --> 55:05.400
[SPEAKER_19]: No, I don't think so.

55:06.640 --> 55:07.980
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, I'm just, like, jabbering.

55:09.824 --> 55:12.727
[SPEAKER_19]: So yeah, Loki, I know what you did with my foot last night.

55:12.987 --> 55:15.649
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know what the heck was going on in that sick mind of yours.

55:16.890 --> 55:23.516
[SPEAKER_19]: And go to gamersadvance.com because they have openings for, like, reviewer people and stuff.

55:24.017 --> 55:31.083
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, gamersadvance.com with a D at the end of advance.

55:31.523 --> 55:31.783
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay?

55:33.125 --> 55:33.965
[SPEAKER_19]: Spits.com.

55:34.166 --> 55:34.846
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, Spits.com.

55:35.987 --> 55:36.708
[SPEAKER_19]: I come out into the...

55:37.435 --> 55:38.416
[SPEAKER_19]: I think he was high.

55:38.516 --> 55:39.517
[SPEAKER_19]: He was something.

55:39.537 --> 55:42.579
[SPEAKER_19]: He was so high he forgot to mention Captain Jack.

55:42.599 --> 55:43.099
[SPEAKER_19]: No, it's fine.

55:43.180 --> 55:43.920
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm just teasing.

56:03.234 --> 56:04.395
[SPEAKER_15]: I do agree with the Doritos.

56:04.415 --> 56:05.676
[SPEAKER_06]: Doritos are the shit though.

56:05.716 --> 56:06.457
[SPEAKER_06]: Doritos are awesome.

56:06.477 --> 56:07.858
[SPEAKER_15]: Ranch Doritos are good, but you know what?

56:08.339 --> 56:09.399
[SPEAKER_15]: Nothing beats the original.

56:09.600 --> 56:11.021
[SPEAKER_15]: They're the cheesy.

56:11.341 --> 56:12.942
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, the cheesiest is Cheetos, right?

56:13.663 --> 56:14.103
[SPEAKER_06]: I think so.

56:14.684 --> 56:17.226
[SPEAKER_15]: They're the cheesiest to me in my book.

56:17.806 --> 56:19.507
[SPEAKER_06]: Our listeners are kind of sedated tonight.

56:19.547 --> 56:20.448
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what's going on.

56:20.648 --> 56:21.469
[SPEAKER_06]: No, what's going on?

56:21.549 --> 56:21.909
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

56:21.929 --> 56:24.812
[SPEAKER_15]: Did you guys put on a fire or something?

56:25.232 --> 56:27.774
[SPEAKER_15]: Shut all the windows or something?

56:29.275 --> 56:30.156
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go to another message.

56:31.667 --> 56:33.308
[SPEAKER_16]: Greetings, Orange Lounge Radio.

56:33.368 --> 56:36.830
[SPEAKER_16]: This is El Mullet with my thoughts on the passing of Captain Jack.

56:38.171 --> 56:39.812
[SPEAKER_16]: I really like Captain Jack's music.

56:39.872 --> 56:46.916
[SPEAKER_16]: I've played it ever since the second remix home version when two of his songs were used as preview tracks.

56:47.936 --> 56:49.998
[SPEAKER_16]: And I remember Captain Jack fondly.

56:50.838 --> 56:52.439
[SPEAKER_16]: He had some of my favorite songs.

56:52.919 --> 57:00.964
[SPEAKER_16]: And I remember him especially fondly because Captain Jack's Grand Ballet mix was the first catastrophic level song that I have ever passed.

57:01.601 --> 57:06.924
[SPEAKER_16]: which is really odd considering his step chart is incredibly difficult to begin with.

57:07.444 --> 57:09.485
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, it is.

57:09.766 --> 57:15.789
[SPEAKER_16]: And also, Dream of Dream was the first heavy song at seven stars that I ever AAA'd.

57:16.950 --> 57:22.953
[SPEAKER_16]: In any case, Captain Jack was very fun not only to listen to but to look at through his music videos.

57:23.573 --> 57:26.555
[SPEAKER_16]: If you wanted to know where all the white women were at, there they were.

57:27.896 --> 57:29.777
[SPEAKER_16]: And in any case, I will remember him

57:30.700 --> 57:37.404
[SPEAKER_16]: with the greatest of memories, as it were, for lack of better words, and embarrassing myself on your new message line.

57:38.885 --> 57:40.025
[SPEAKER_15]: It's okay, everybody else is.

57:40.385 --> 57:48.310
[SPEAKER_16]: I shall be playing his songs in remembrance, and thank you for allowing me this forum to talk about Captain Jack.

57:48.810 --> 57:50.531
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you very much, everyone, and goodbye.

57:50.551 --> 57:54.693
[SPEAKER_06]: Where are the white women going to hang out now?

57:55.214 --> 57:57.615
[SPEAKER_06]: Now that Captain Jack's gone, where are all the white women going to go?

57:58.468 --> 58:00.249
[SPEAKER_15]: They'll go hang out with another gangsta.

58:00.609 --> 58:02.089
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, I don't know.

58:02.209 --> 58:02.809
[SPEAKER_15]: In Germany.

58:04.890 --> 58:05.770
[SPEAKER_06]: Good message, I like that.

58:06.871 --> 58:07.691
[SPEAKER_15]: Wasn't he from Germany?

58:08.551 --> 58:13.533
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I don't think he was from Germany, but he was big in Germany, like Hasselhoff was big in Germany.

58:15.613 --> 58:22.736
[SPEAKER_06]: Baywatch.de Let's go to another message here on the Orange Lounge Radio message line, then we're going to open it up for live calls very soon.

58:24.336 --> 58:26.757
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, Orange Lounge People, this is Goggles Chatroom.

58:29.295 --> 58:37.022
[SPEAKER_12]: Dream of Dream was one of the first songs I played in DDR, and I guess it always held a special place in my heart.

58:38.583 --> 58:46.029
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, and then I hung up.

58:46.990 --> 58:49.712
[SPEAKER_06]: No, Dream of Dream is one of the awesome DDR songs.

58:49.772 --> 58:53.515
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got to play that at some point tonight, because Dream of Dream, that's one of my favorite DDR songs as well.

58:54.448 --> 59:06.692
[SPEAKER_26]: Didn't I play that, like, when I first came up here and on, like, episode 37 or something and we went to, like, Stockton and, like, they had, like, a fourth mix there or something and I played it there?

59:08.390 --> 59:37.283
[SPEAKER_06]: possibly, Dream of Dreams debut was on 4th Mix and it's got a really, you know, the riff is from Hall of the Mountain King which is, you know, one of the, you know, like classic songs I do seem to recall that we went out and played like 4th or 5th Mix and probably that song came up because it's an easy as hell 7 footer but when I say easy, I mean fun like it was like a very constant, you know, the steps and a lot of people have fun with it if you're going to AAA heavy songs, Dream of Dreams is a good one to start off with

59:38.803 --> 59:39.624
[SPEAKER_26]: What are you talking about?

59:39.664 --> 59:41.705
[SPEAKER_26]: I still can't follow Heavy Arrows anyway.

59:43.127 --> 59:44.688
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know, it's a good song to warm up to.

59:44.708 --> 59:45.669
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a good song to warm up to.

59:45.689 --> 59:47.610
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, we got one more message on the message line.

59:47.630 --> 59:48.091
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go to it.

59:50.192 --> 59:51.473
[SPEAKER_21]: Hi, this is Illusion.

59:51.613 --> 59:53.615
[SPEAKER_21]: Everybody, you know, what do you like?

59:54.496 --> 01:00:04.884
[SPEAKER_21]: When I found out Captain Jack died, I was surprised, but I didn't think it would affect DVR much because we got all his recordings out of the way.

01:00:05.905 --> 01:00:08.227
[SPEAKER_21]: But, yeah, I was surprised and

01:00:09.787 --> 01:00:15.473
[SPEAKER_21]: It was a sad thing to hear, and I hope his family's doing just fine now.

01:00:17.175 --> 01:00:22.520
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, of course, Captain Jack, his family, gotta be taking this harder than anybody in the scene is.

01:00:24.542 --> 01:00:28.046
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously, our thoughts go out to Captain Jack's family and the surviving relatives.

01:00:30.239 --> 01:00:31.640
[SPEAKER_06]: How many times was Captain Jack married?

01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:32.341
[SPEAKER_06]: Only once?

01:00:32.501 --> 01:00:33.902
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure.

01:00:34.122 --> 01:00:38.686
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the lead singer of Captain Jack at one point was his wife.

01:00:39.006 --> 01:00:42.249
[SPEAKER_06]: There were like four different women in Captain Jack at one point.

01:00:42.509 --> 01:00:45.872
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the first one was his wife at some point.

01:00:47.634 --> 01:00:48.715
[SPEAKER_06]: You think they were all his wives?

01:00:49.836 --> 01:00:50.176
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

01:00:51.317 --> 01:00:51.677
[SPEAKER_06]: Never mind.

01:00:52.698 --> 01:00:54.219
[SPEAKER_06]: He was in more women than they were in...

01:01:00.906 --> 01:01:01.446
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, shit.

01:01:01.526 --> 01:01:04.428
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, on that note, let's go skypline.

01:01:04.448 --> 01:01:07.870
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll take your calls on anything, anything you want to talk about within reason, kids.

01:01:07.930 --> 01:01:14.133
[SPEAKER_06]: You can either call us the old-fashioned way by loading up the skypline, or you can give us a call on the telephone.

01:01:14.213 --> 01:01:20.556
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, our brand-new telephone number that you can give us a call on, it is area code 916-226-9067.

01:01:22.838 --> 01:01:24.418
[SPEAKER_06]: Either way you want to do it there.

01:01:24.458 --> 01:01:28.220
[SPEAKER_06]: But, of course, kids, ask your parents' permission before calling because it might be a toll charge.

01:01:30.287 --> 01:01:30.507
[SPEAKER_06]: Sephiroth 1215

01:01:46.171 --> 01:01:48.774
[SPEAKER_30]: First of all, yeah, sadly Captain Jack died.

01:01:48.834 --> 01:01:57.001
[SPEAKER_30]: I actually had friends over when the news came up and they really even played EDR and even they were kind of awing.

01:01:57.722 --> 01:02:00.024
[SPEAKER_06]: Because they recognized the pimpness of Captain Jack.

01:02:00.424 --> 01:02:03.227
[SPEAKER_06]: Surely that guy had a ton of medals.

01:02:04.793 --> 01:02:05.453
[SPEAKER_06]: for a reason.

01:02:06.053 --> 01:02:06.374
[SPEAKER_30]: Yeah.

01:02:07.274 --> 01:02:07.514
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

01:02:08.494 --> 01:02:12.455
[SPEAKER_30]: I mean, hopefully, I'm sure they would do something in Ultramix 3, but I don't even know.

01:02:12.475 --> 01:02:15.576
[SPEAKER_30]: I don't think there's enough time for them to even put a little tribute in there.

01:02:15.817 --> 01:02:23.259
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be nice for them to say something like in the manual or something, but seeing as the game is probably already on its way to the

01:02:23.679 --> 01:02:38.292
[SPEAKER_06]: Pressing Mill before this news came out I wouldn't expect to see anything in Ultramix 3 regarding this maybe this time next year when the new DDR games come out assuming we're getting more DDR games next year but I don't see how we couldn't possibly be maybe we'll see something in Beatmania

01:02:38.712 --> 01:02:59.766
[SPEAKER_06]: although I don't know about that and the only way I guess maybe we'd get that is if the race showed up as one of the five key songs but you never know what might happen over at Konami so we'll see now we might see something in DDR Strike the Japanese DDR because that still isn't going to be coming out until early 2006 as far as we know so they have plenty of time to do something for Captain Jack if they want over there so we'll see

01:03:01.334 --> 01:03:23.512
[SPEAKER_30]: Yeah, yeah, hopefully they will, but on the same note, I mean, I got to play the demo of Ultramix 3, which, I mean, it, the demo actually was kind of broken, well, maybe it was just the disc, but it froze up a lot for me, but otherwise it played just the same as Ultramix 2, except for the bubbles, and that's it.

01:03:23.852 --> 01:03:30.234
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, from what I remember at E3, the game did play just like Ultramix 2 with maybe some minor differences, so I don't know.

01:03:30.274 --> 01:03:35.815
[SPEAKER_06]: But then again, Ultramix 2 is one of the better Bomani games they put out ever at the home, so if it ain't broke, don't fix it, right?

01:03:37.216 --> 01:03:38.596
[SPEAKER_30]: Oh yeah, yeah, I'm sure it'll be fine.

01:03:38.656 --> 01:03:40.016
[SPEAKER_30]: It was just a demo disc I got.

01:03:40.156 --> 01:03:41.757
[SPEAKER_30]: Yeah.

01:03:41.817 --> 01:03:49.839
[SPEAKER_30]: Otherwise, I saw an ad for it, and I believe it even said in the chatroom that

01:03:50.925 --> 01:03:53.547
[SPEAKER_30]: Run DMC is going to be in there with Walk This Way.

01:03:54.548 --> 01:03:54.949
[SPEAKER_30]: Really?

01:03:55.750 --> 01:03:55.930
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

01:03:55.950 --> 01:03:56.871
[SPEAKER_30]: Where did we hear that?

01:03:57.071 --> 01:03:58.372
[SPEAKER_30]: Was that on the podcast or something?

01:03:58.652 --> 01:03:59.253
[SPEAKER_30]: I might have missed it.

01:04:01.235 --> 01:04:07.080
[SPEAKER_30]: No, it was just in the chat room before and they have it advertised in an ad in a magazine.

01:04:07.841 --> 01:04:09.042
[SPEAKER_30]: They just have the background for it.

01:04:09.162 --> 01:04:09.482
[SPEAKER_30]: Wow.

01:04:09.622 --> 01:04:15.688
[SPEAKER_06]: It was based on like they saw there's a screenshot of a movie which looks like, you know, from the video.

01:04:16.343 --> 01:04:17.023
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

01:04:17.043 --> 01:04:23.806
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that would be a very interesting... I mean, obviously this is looking like one of the more diverse mixes we've gotten, so something like that wouldn't surprise me at all.

01:04:23.866 --> 01:04:29.007
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, MidiHead said that 80% of the music that was going to be in Ultramix 3 is going to be new to DDR.

01:04:29.147 --> 01:04:29.347
[SPEAKER_06]: Good!

01:04:30.468 --> 01:04:30.628
[SPEAKER_06]: Good.

01:04:30.908 --> 01:04:31.288
[SPEAKER_06]: Good news.

01:04:32.488 --> 01:04:34.869
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want the Japanese crossovers, go play Extreme 2.

01:04:35.169 --> 01:04:36.630
[SPEAKER_06]: Or go buy a Japanese PlayStation.

01:04:40.771 --> 01:04:42.072
[SPEAKER_30]: Also, the ad said that...

01:04:43.268 --> 01:04:47.312
[SPEAKER_30]: There's a new website called musicineverydirection.com.

01:04:47.972 --> 01:04:49.674
[SPEAKER_30]: I went today, but it's not even up yet.

01:04:50.875 --> 01:04:53.117
[SPEAKER_30]: And it also says coming soon to mobile.

01:04:53.958 --> 01:04:54.679
[SPEAKER_30]: What, DDR?

01:04:55.499 --> 01:04:55.820
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

01:04:56.280 --> 01:04:57.021
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of weird.

01:04:58.635 --> 01:05:00.836
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, well, it wouldn't surprise me, I guess.

01:05:00.876 --> 01:05:04.579
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they had Pump It Up on mobile overseas, so... And you know what?

01:05:04.619 --> 01:05:09.181
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Konami's been doing the mobile thing, because I downloaded Castlevania on the mobile phone, which, by the way, sucked.

01:05:10.022 --> 01:05:19.548
[SPEAKER_06]: But it was there, and it was on the mobile phone, so it wouldn't surprise me if DDR shows up on mobile, but I don't really get the point, because you can't dance, but whatever.

01:05:21.638 --> 01:05:23.238
[SPEAKER_30]: Yeah, whatever, I guess.

01:05:23.678 --> 01:05:24.038
[SPEAKER_30]: You're right.

01:05:25.599 --> 01:05:33.480
[SPEAKER_30]: Otherwise, the demo also has a demo of Castlevania, but I got really pissed off because that's the one demo that absolutely would not work on there.

01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:34.020
[SPEAKER_30]: Really?

01:05:34.861 --> 01:05:35.361
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

01:05:35.581 --> 01:05:38.141
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I want to check out the Castlevania demo, though, but it doesn't work?

01:05:38.181 --> 01:05:40.282
[SPEAKER_06]: How did that get by QA?

01:05:41.822 --> 01:05:45.483
[SPEAKER_30]: It says that it's unable to read disk every time I try and do it.

01:05:46.443 --> 01:05:47.223
[SPEAKER_06]: Very interesting.

01:05:47.243 --> 01:05:47.463
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

01:05:47.912 --> 01:05:49.412
[SPEAKER_06]: Those merits coming out in two weeks anyways.

01:05:50.093 --> 01:05:51.853
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but we want to play a free demo.

01:05:53.014 --> 01:05:53.494
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever.

01:05:54.674 --> 01:05:55.734
[SPEAKER_06]: Free stuff rocks.

01:05:56.074 --> 01:05:56.495
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

01:05:57.635 --> 01:06:07.358
[SPEAKER_30]: Speaking of free stuff, Toys R Us now has a deal going on this week where you can buy two Xbox, PS2, or GameCube games and you get one free.

01:06:07.598 --> 01:06:07.998
[SPEAKER_30]: Any of them.

01:06:08.838 --> 01:06:09.158
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

01:06:09.279 --> 01:06:10.079
[SPEAKER_06]: Buy two, get one free?

01:06:11.039 --> 01:06:11.719
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

01:06:11.779 --> 01:06:14.480
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, man, I just bought two games at Toys R Us last week.

01:06:15.501 --> 01:06:16.121
[SPEAKER_06]: Bastards.

01:06:16.161 --> 01:06:17.801
[SPEAKER_06]: They always do that shit after I shop there.

01:06:17.841 --> 01:06:18.081
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, well.

01:06:18.702 --> 01:06:19.282
[SPEAKER_06]: That's cool, though.

01:06:19.362 --> 01:06:20.442
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, I'm going to have to go check that out.

01:06:20.462 --> 01:06:25.084
[SPEAKER_06]: I imagine they're probably trying to clear the shelves to make way for an Xbox 360 setup, but we'll see.

01:06:26.464 --> 01:06:26.845
[SPEAKER_30]: Maybe.

01:06:28.685 --> 01:06:30.526
[SPEAKER_30]: Otherwise, I guess that's it for me.

01:06:30.786 --> 01:06:31.026
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

01:06:31.286 --> 01:06:31.706
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds good.

01:06:31.766 --> 01:06:34.047
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for the call, and take care, Sephiroth, okay?

01:06:34.707 --> 01:06:35.487
[SPEAKER_30]: Okay, you too.

01:06:35.507 --> 01:06:35.768
[SPEAKER_06]: Later.

01:06:37.228 --> 01:06:37.928
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go to another call.

01:06:38.909 --> 01:06:39.689
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:06:42.748 --> 01:06:42.948
[SPEAKER_17]: Hello?

01:06:43.368 --> 01:06:43.648
[SPEAKER_17]: Hello?

01:06:44.128 --> 01:06:44.308
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

01:06:44.328 --> 01:06:44.748
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello.

01:06:44.948 --> 01:06:45.349
[SPEAKER_17]: Hello.

01:06:46.589 --> 01:06:47.569
[SPEAKER_17]: It's Nintendo Maniac 64.

01:06:48.549 --> 01:06:50.390
[SPEAKER_06]: How you doing, Nintendo Maniac 64?

01:06:51.350 --> 01:06:52.730
[SPEAKER_17]: By the way, I was not high.

01:06:53.130 --> 01:06:54.851
[SPEAKER_06]: I knew that was you that had called in earlier.

01:06:56.511 --> 01:07:04.993
[SPEAKER_06]: You tell me, though, how we're supposed to not think you're high, because, you know, you got the Dorito Craven going on, and you kind of had that voice on your message like, Hey, guys.

01:07:08.268 --> 01:07:10.350
[SPEAKER_17]: The phone, excuse me, it's not exactly the loudest thing.

01:07:11.071 --> 01:07:12.793
[SPEAKER_17]: I know, it's a cheap phone.

01:07:13.213 --> 01:07:14.935
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we have like five bucks on that.

01:07:15.236 --> 01:07:15.576
[SPEAKER_06]: What is that?

01:07:15.736 --> 01:07:18.760
[SPEAKER_06]: There's some noise in the background there that sounds like Christopher's car.

01:07:19.140 --> 01:07:19.581
[SPEAKER_06]: Like this is...

01:07:22.444 --> 01:07:24.085
[SPEAKER_06]: This is probably my laptop's fan.

01:07:24.325 --> 01:07:34.170
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay, because the belt on Christopher's car is like about to fall off or something, so every time he starts his car, like if we had a microphone cord that we could run outside, we probably wouldn't even need to get it outside, we'd just get it to the door.

01:07:34.291 --> 01:07:38.113
[SPEAKER_15]: Seriously, every single time I start the car, everybody thinks there's a fire going on somewhere.

01:07:38.293 --> 01:07:47.398
[SPEAKER_06]: I know when Christopher leaves for work in the morning, because like he'll turn on his car and then, like you hear this really loud belt noise that I'm sure wakes up all the neighbors.

01:07:47.438 --> 01:07:48.718
[SPEAKER_15]: I need to announce when I leave.

01:07:50.119 --> 01:07:51.660
[SPEAKER_06]: X the fun has left the building.

01:07:52.629 --> 01:07:53.510
[SPEAKER_17]: Excuse me.

01:07:54.391 --> 01:07:54.711
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright.

01:07:55.632 --> 01:08:00.638
[SPEAKER_17]: There is a song that actually has, like, pardon me, like, let's wake up the neighbors or something.

01:08:01.559 --> 01:08:03.100
[SPEAKER_06]: I usually play that when you're playing.

01:08:03.861 --> 01:08:10.008
[SPEAKER_06]: I just, you know, between you and me, we kind of live in the ghetto as it is, so I don't want to have music wars around here because we will lose.

01:08:13.825 --> 01:08:14.566
[SPEAKER_17]: What else is on your mind?

01:08:15.127 --> 01:08:15.627
[SPEAKER_17]: Doritos.

01:08:15.667 --> 01:08:17.369
[SPEAKER_06]: Doritos coming out tomorrow.

01:08:18.030 --> 01:08:18.691
[SPEAKER_06]: What's coming out tomorrow?

01:08:19.291 --> 01:08:20.313
[SPEAKER_06]: Mario Mix, DDR.

01:08:20.653 --> 01:08:22.095
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah, DDR Mario Mix.

01:08:22.115 --> 01:08:23.857
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, hell, the DDR I forgot all about.

01:08:24.337 --> 01:08:27.741
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, DDR Mario Mix is coming out tomorrow, and that's about all I have to say.

01:08:28.262 --> 01:08:31.566
[SPEAKER_06]: No, maybe I'll check it out, but at the same time,

01:08:34.543 --> 01:08:38.444
[SPEAKER_06]: It's easy, and it's chibi, and I don't know.

01:08:39.184 --> 01:08:41.725
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not looking forward to paying $60 for it.

01:08:42.425 --> 01:08:42.925
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?

01:08:43.665 --> 01:08:44.265
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I know.

01:08:44.625 --> 01:08:47.426
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I only have a GameCube because I'm not rich and stuff.

01:08:48.746 --> 01:08:50.046
[SPEAKER_17]: I can't afford many consoles.

01:08:50.786 --> 01:08:53.587
[SPEAKER_06]: Neither am I, but I sell drugs.

01:08:53.867 --> 01:08:54.707
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

01:08:54.727 --> 01:08:56.828
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and I sell Doritos.

01:08:59.511 --> 01:09:04.194
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I have a day job where I make decent money.

01:09:04.714 --> 01:09:05.655
[SPEAKER_06]: Selling drugs to kids.

01:09:05.735 --> 01:09:06.936
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I do not sell drugs to kids.

01:09:06.976 --> 01:09:07.836
[SPEAKER_06]: He sells drugs to kids.

01:09:07.856 --> 01:09:09.037
[SPEAKER_06]: I do not sell drugs to kids.

01:09:09.357 --> 01:09:10.518
[SPEAKER_06]: You might as well just get it out.

01:09:10.558 --> 01:09:12.479
[SPEAKER_06]: I sell drugs to nuns, not kids.

01:09:13.279 --> 01:09:13.539
[SPEAKER_06]: Nuns?

01:09:14.500 --> 01:09:15.941
[SPEAKER_15]: Kids that are in training to be nuns.

01:09:20.739 --> 01:09:31.005
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I have a day job, and since we live in the ghetto, my rent isn't very expensive, so I have leftover money to spend on things like Bomani Games and, you know, systems and drugs.

01:09:33.126 --> 01:09:33.526
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm kidding!

01:09:34.447 --> 01:09:36.128
[SPEAKER_06]: Drugs are for losers.

01:09:36.788 --> 01:09:37.629
[SPEAKER_15]: Unless you want some weed.

01:09:37.649 --> 01:09:38.169
[SPEAKER_06]: Except for Vicodin.

01:09:38.189 --> 01:09:38.870
[SPEAKER_06]: Vicodin is for winners.

01:09:45.011 --> 01:09:46.232
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of losers in high school.

01:09:46.472 --> 01:09:51.396
[SPEAKER_06]: What was that big FBI message that used to show up at the beginning of all the Capcom games like Final Fight and stuff?

01:09:51.656 --> 01:09:53.657
[SPEAKER_06]: Winners don't use drugs for the big FBI.

01:09:53.717 --> 01:09:55.318
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's like, dude, this is a video game.

01:09:55.358 --> 01:09:56.619
[SPEAKER_06]: Why are we... I don't know.

01:09:57.660 --> 01:09:59.081
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like community service.

01:09:59.201 --> 01:09:59.742
[SPEAKER_10]: What the heck?

01:10:00.442 --> 01:10:01.423
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, I'm being random.

01:10:02.204 --> 01:10:03.385
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, much like you.

01:10:06.408 --> 01:10:09.511
[SPEAKER_06]: Any other thoughts, Mr. Nintendomaniac64, before we go to another call?

01:10:10.212 --> 01:10:13.015
[SPEAKER_17]: I think my parents are right next door, like, making love to each other.

01:10:13.635 --> 01:10:13.936
[SPEAKER_17]: What?!

01:10:15.858 --> 01:10:16.438
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm serious.

01:10:16.538 --> 01:10:17.759
[SPEAKER_15]: I can tell you stories.

01:10:18.140 --> 01:10:19.161
[SPEAKER_15]: Wait, wait, wait.

01:10:19.181 --> 01:10:21.123
[SPEAKER_15]: Did he say the parents are next door?

01:10:21.683 --> 01:10:22.744
[SPEAKER_15]: Making love to each other.

01:10:23.405 --> 01:10:26.588
[SPEAKER_17]: My parents are, like, right next door to my room.

01:10:27.148 --> 01:10:27.288
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh-huh.

01:10:28.989 --> 01:10:30.030
[SPEAKER_17]: Are you hearing things?

01:10:31.131 --> 01:10:32.052
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, not much.

01:10:32.272 --> 01:10:33.373
[SPEAKER_17]: It's very mumbled.

01:10:34.073 --> 01:10:34.774
[SPEAKER_17]: And, like, muffled.

01:10:34.854 --> 01:10:37.236
[SPEAKER_06]: Would we be able to hear it if you put the phone next to the wall?

01:10:37.996 --> 01:10:38.577
[SPEAKER_06]: No, you wouldn't.

01:10:40.270 --> 01:10:41.451
[SPEAKER_06]: You make for bad radio.

01:10:41.471 --> 01:10:44.834
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you have any pictures on the wall that are kind of, like, vibrating?

01:10:44.854 --> 01:10:47.256
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what used to happen to me.

01:10:47.276 --> 01:10:48.097
[SPEAKER_15]: Dude, it's his parent.

01:10:48.177 --> 01:10:48.897
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, my God.

01:10:48.977 --> 01:10:52.280
[SPEAKER_15]: You've heard your... You know, I have stories.

01:10:53.761 --> 01:10:54.082
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, wow.

01:10:55.329 --> 01:10:56.390
[SPEAKER_15]: I do have stories, though.

01:10:57.211 --> 01:11:00.093
[SPEAKER_06]: Look, Captain Jack would have wanted us to talk about the bitches, alright?

01:11:01.374 --> 01:11:02.895
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, Captain Jack, I didn't say anything.

01:11:04.476 --> 01:11:06.438
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, now we definitely gotta let you go.

01:11:06.478 --> 01:11:07.979
[SPEAKER_06]: The chat room is about to have an aneurysm, okay?

01:11:08.660 --> 01:11:10.401
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, have a good one.

01:11:11.242 --> 01:11:12.022
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, bye.

01:11:13.343 --> 01:11:14.244
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go to another call.

01:11:15.025 --> 01:11:16.025
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:11:17.126 --> 01:11:17.527
[SPEAKER_24]: Really?

01:11:18.147 --> 01:11:18.387
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

01:11:20.249 --> 01:11:21.610
[SPEAKER_24]: It is I, E.T.

01:11:22.571 --> 01:11:22.731
[SPEAKER_05]: Who?

01:11:24.414 --> 01:11:24.754
[SPEAKER_05]: Dark.

01:11:25.655 --> 01:11:26.415
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, hey, what's up?

01:11:26.455 --> 01:11:26.975
[SPEAKER_06]: What's on your mind?

01:11:26.995 --> 01:11:29.937
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, I just thought I'd call.

01:11:30.997 --> 01:11:33.899
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the one and only Dark Tetsuya from our chatroom, boys and girls.

01:11:34.119 --> 01:11:34.739
[SPEAKER_06]: Yo, yo.

01:11:34.879 --> 01:11:36.080
[SPEAKER_24]: Hey, how's it going?

01:11:36.200 --> 01:11:37.121
[SPEAKER_06]: Good, what's on your mind?

01:11:38.421 --> 01:11:41.143
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know, I just thought I'd call in.

01:11:42.503 --> 01:11:46.766
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you're utilizing our new phone line, I can see, from the caller ID, so.

01:11:47.226 --> 01:11:49.507
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I, yeah.

01:11:50.225 --> 01:11:50.585
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

01:11:50.705 --> 01:11:51.786
[SPEAKER_06]: You have a caller ID on that?

01:11:51.826 --> 01:11:52.747
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we have a caller ID on here.

01:11:52.767 --> 01:11:55.028
[SPEAKER_06]: So if we get crank callers, we know who you are.

01:11:55.048 --> 01:11:56.309
[SPEAKER_15]: We can stop 69 your ass.

01:11:56.629 --> 01:11:57.830
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to stop 69 your ass.

01:11:58.110 --> 01:11:58.930
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, what's on your mind?

01:12:00.451 --> 01:12:02.212
[SPEAKER_06]: What was your reaction to the news about Captain Jack?

01:12:03.433 --> 01:12:06.575
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, that was a total surprise.

01:12:07.795 --> 01:12:09.617
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it was very sudden because he was so young, obviously.

01:12:10.377 --> 01:12:10.797
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, yeah.

01:12:12.178 --> 01:12:14.019
[SPEAKER_24]: No, my brother was a big fan of his.

01:12:15.640 --> 01:12:16.921
[SPEAKER_06]: Is your brother much of a DDR player?

01:12:18.422 --> 01:12:18.862
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, he is.

01:12:23.271 --> 01:12:23.991
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, very cool.

01:12:26.092 --> 01:12:32.575
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah, it was kind of a bummer, because it was very sudden and everything, and he kind of died young, which is really too bad.

01:12:32.655 --> 01:12:33.135
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I know.

01:12:34.296 --> 01:12:35.156
[SPEAKER_06]: It sucks, X-Fur.

01:12:35.176 --> 01:12:35.816
[SPEAKER_06]: It really sucks.

01:12:36.257 --> 01:12:38.458
[SPEAKER_06]: And some people are really hurting, X-Fur.

01:12:40.378 --> 01:12:40.839
Bastard.

01:12:41.239 --> 01:12:43.340
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, what else is on your mind, DT?

01:12:48.784 --> 01:12:51.586
[SPEAKER_06]: Any cool games you've been playing this week you want to tell us about?

01:12:51.606 --> 01:12:52.687
[SPEAKER_06]: Just Extreme 2.

01:12:53.348 --> 01:12:54.509
[SPEAKER_06]: Extreme 2, how's that going?

01:12:54.529 --> 01:12:55.609
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you unlocked all the songs yet?

01:12:56.830 --> 01:12:58.552
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh no, I had to start over.

01:12:58.592 --> 01:13:00.793
[SPEAKER_24]: I tripped over the power cord.

01:13:01.994 --> 01:13:03.856
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh shit, you tripped over the power cord?

01:13:04.396 --> 01:13:07.058
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

01:13:07.458 --> 01:13:08.919
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh no, that's the worst.

01:13:08.999 --> 01:13:10.781
[SPEAKER_06]: Like when the game was saving or something?

01:13:11.221 --> 01:13:13.403
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, when it was booting up.

01:13:15.042 --> 01:13:24.947
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm always afraid that that's going to happen to me, like when it says do not pull out the memory card, especially on those games that take forever to save to the memory card because the files are so huge, like a game like Cold Step or something.

01:13:27.128 --> 01:13:31.550
[SPEAKER_06]: When the file's saving, I'm afraid that Thunder's going to hit and then turn off my PlayStation 2.

01:13:31.650 --> 01:13:34.331
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be God's little joke on me, honestly.

01:13:34.692 --> 01:13:35.952
[SPEAKER_07]: Hehehe, I erased your file.

01:13:36.813 --> 01:13:37.833
[SPEAKER_07]: Hehehe, 27 hours on the game.

01:13:37.873 --> 01:13:39.814
[SPEAKER_07]: Hehehe, you're going to hell.

01:13:41.195 --> 01:13:43.676
[SPEAKER_29]: Alright, any other thoughts for us, DT, before we get on to another call?

01:13:45.615 --> 01:13:46.636
[SPEAKER_24]: No, that's about it.

01:13:46.716 --> 01:13:51.278
[SPEAKER_24]: I did unlock Section D on the Dance Master mode.

01:13:51.859 --> 01:13:52.299
[SPEAKER_24]: Which song?

01:13:53.360 --> 01:13:54.661
[SPEAKER_24]: So that's been kicking my ass.

01:13:54.941 --> 01:13:55.221
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

01:13:57.222 --> 01:13:58.363
[SPEAKER_24]: So that's pretty much it.

01:13:58.883 --> 01:13:59.263
[SPEAKER_06]: Alrighty.

01:13:59.483 --> 01:14:00.404
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you for calling.

01:14:00.424 --> 01:14:01.425
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, thanks for calling.

01:14:01.505 --> 01:14:01.925
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.

01:14:02.125 --> 01:14:02.385
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

01:14:02.906 --> 01:14:03.566
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a good one.

01:14:03.806 --> 01:14:04.086
[SPEAKER_06]: Later.

01:14:06.147 --> 01:14:09.009
[SPEAKER_06]: Our Skype line is screaming popular tonight.

01:14:09.510 --> 01:14:10.330
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go to another call.

01:14:10.870 --> 01:14:11.811
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.

01:14:13.072 --> 01:14:13.913
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, this is Dark Knight.

01:14:14.033 --> 01:14:15.013
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, Dark Knight, what's up?

01:14:15.594 --> 01:14:16.334
[SPEAKER_15]: Yo, yo, yo.

01:14:17.395 --> 01:14:17.855
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, DJ.

01:14:17.876 --> 01:14:19.477
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, what's up?

01:14:20.658 --> 01:14:27.042
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought I'd just pass along this for you about what I heard about Yahoo maybe trying a little DDR themselves.

01:14:27.743 --> 01:14:29.364
[SPEAKER_08]: Yahoo is getting into DDR?

01:14:31.013 --> 01:14:40.319
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, apparently they put out like a little game from Wild Tangent or something like that called Dance on Mag or Dance Groove or something like that.

01:14:40.359 --> 01:14:40.619
[SPEAKER_06]: Aw, fuck.

01:14:40.679 --> 01:14:45.281
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't Wild Tangent... Loki, wasn't Wild Tangent the one that did Tappa Jam?

01:14:45.642 --> 01:14:46.942
[SPEAKER_06]: Or am I confusing that with somebody else?

01:14:47.143 --> 01:14:50.344
[SPEAKER_06]: You remember that Tappa Jam, the one that was like Beatmania but it was all like classical songs?

01:14:50.364 --> 01:14:51.145
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think that was.

01:14:51.165 --> 01:14:51.565
[SPEAKER_06]: Was that them?

01:14:51.905 --> 01:14:53.006
[SPEAKER_06]: Wild Tangent does something.

01:14:53.066 --> 01:14:56.228
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Wild Tangent actually... No, Wild Tangent does the shitty AOL games.

01:14:57.569 --> 01:15:04.153
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought they were just, it was just like some sort of, um, like a script package or something like that.

01:15:04.233 --> 01:15:07.255
[SPEAKER_08]: Devil work, that's what it is, devil, devil stuff.

01:15:08.036 --> 01:15:08.236
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

01:15:09.116 --> 01:15:11.918
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, I took a look at this game and everything, right?

01:15:12.599 --> 01:15:18.602
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, they do, like, Buster Groove, but they also have, like, a little DDR mode as well mixed into it.

01:15:20.123 --> 01:15:23.946
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's, oh, wait, I think I've played, you know what, I think I've played a game like this before.

01:15:24.366 --> 01:15:27.568
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, I think I pointed it out like a long time ago on AIM.

01:15:27.729 --> 01:15:30.671
[SPEAKER_06]: But I didn't, it wasn't a Yahoo game, it was an AIM game.

01:15:30.691 --> 01:15:35.034
[SPEAKER_26]: No, yeah, it was an AIM game, but maybe they're like Licensing it out to Yahoo.

01:15:35.094 --> 01:15:35.715
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, exactly.

01:15:35.735 --> 01:15:39.157
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe, okay, because that would make sense because if Wild Tangent did the AOL games Right.

01:15:39.858 --> 01:15:43.440
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, okay, so this game is about to get a little bit bigger it looks like.

01:15:43.560 --> 01:15:44.081
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, brother.

01:15:44.201 --> 01:15:45.101
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, goody, goody, goody.

01:15:45.182 --> 01:15:45.662
[SPEAKER_26]: Yay.

01:15:47.243 --> 01:15:48.424
[SPEAKER_08]: It looked weird, I was like

01:15:49.342 --> 01:15:50.683
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait, man, this is like Busted Groove.

01:15:50.963 --> 01:15:52.684
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait, man, this is like DDR.

01:15:53.325 --> 01:15:56.607
[SPEAKER_06]: I suppose imitation is the finest form of flattery?

01:15:57.347 --> 01:15:57.908
[SPEAKER_06]: Very much.

01:15:58.808 --> 01:16:03.971
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, with the gallon there, the only problem is that if you have a slow computer, of course, the timing will be atrocious.

01:16:04.632 --> 01:16:05.172
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.

01:16:05.652 --> 01:16:10.595
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember, I seem to recall that, was that it was a very slow game.

01:16:10.635 --> 01:16:12.717
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, even on my computer, which is kind of, you know, it's nice.

01:16:12.797 --> 01:16:14.058
[SPEAKER_06]: It was kind of a slow-running game.

01:16:14.458 --> 01:16:16.319
[SPEAKER_06]: Not a very optimized game, so...

01:16:16.579 --> 01:16:26.945
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but here's another weird story about how McDonald's might be, McDonald's will let Nintendo DS owners play the Wi-Fi servers.

01:16:27.406 --> 01:16:29.507
[SPEAKER_06]: I heard about this, the Wi-Fi at McDonald's.

01:16:29.607 --> 01:16:33.870
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, when I think about, here, let me think about places I want to go play my DS.

01:16:33.950 --> 01:16:35.431
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think, oh, McD's.

01:16:38.072 --> 01:16:45.537
[SPEAKER_06]: McDonald's was cool for social gatherings when I was six years old and some kid would have their birthday party there because their parents were poor.

01:16:45.973 --> 01:16:48.434
[SPEAKER_06]: and couldn't afford anything but a McDonald's birthday party.

01:16:48.755 --> 01:16:49.315
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

01:16:50.416 --> 01:16:57.840
[SPEAKER_08]: It's funny though, I was like, you get beat in there, and I was like, yeah, I would like a Big Mac, an order of fries, and a Wi-Fi connection.

01:16:59.701 --> 01:17:01.282
[SPEAKER_06]: Would you like to supersize your Wi-Fi?

01:17:02.122 --> 01:17:02.703
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I would.

01:17:03.772 --> 01:17:05.333
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, that's going to be interesting.

01:17:05.393 --> 01:17:07.934
[SPEAKER_06]: So McDonald's is going to become the DS hotspot.

01:17:08.214 --> 01:17:09.894
[SPEAKER_26]: I believe I read that on Slashdot.

01:17:10.334 --> 01:17:12.295
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I read that somewhere on the internet this week.

01:17:12.375 --> 01:17:13.096
[SPEAKER_06]: It's interesting.

01:17:14.136 --> 01:17:16.377
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's weird how they send this all up.

01:17:16.437 --> 01:17:21.239
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like Nintendo DS Wi-Fi, open up to everybody in the U.S.

01:17:21.459 --> 01:17:22.339
[SPEAKER_08]: How about McDonald's now?

01:17:23.139 --> 01:17:29.302
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I seem to remember, though, didn't McDonald's also at one point have Nintendo 64s in a lot of their stores for kids to play?

01:17:29.682 --> 01:17:32.143
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like a little toy, I guess it was.

01:17:33.223 --> 01:17:36.745
[SPEAKER_06]: So Nintendo and McDonald's are kind of teaming up a little bit here, I see.

01:17:37.005 --> 01:17:45.088
[SPEAKER_26]: I was going to say that, like, the, what do you call it, the Ronald House thing that I'm trying to, for like sick kids and stuff.

01:17:45.148 --> 01:17:45.508
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, okay.

01:17:45.528 --> 01:17:46.589
[SPEAKER_26]: They actually did that.

01:17:46.649 --> 01:17:52.531
[SPEAKER_26]: They built the cabinet for, you know, it had like a TV and a Nintendo 64 and stuff, so you're right.

01:17:54.272 --> 01:17:58.654
[SPEAKER_08]: But one time, somebody said Burger King had a DDR machine or something like that.

01:18:00.184 --> 01:18:00.524
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

01:18:00.564 --> 01:18:01.305
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing surprises me.

01:18:01.385 --> 01:18:02.885
[SPEAKER_06]: Franchise owners can get away with a lot.

01:18:03.206 --> 01:18:03.866
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

01:18:03.886 --> 01:18:05.407
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm thinking McDonald's might get it first.

01:18:05.447 --> 01:18:08.028
[SPEAKER_08]: They did do like a little commercial with it.

01:18:08.088 --> 01:18:08.908
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see what happens.

01:18:08.928 --> 01:18:09.469
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be interesting.

01:18:09.749 --> 01:18:11.710
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm curious to see what happens with the Nintendo Wi-Fi.

01:18:11.930 --> 01:18:16.372
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, you know, McDonald's has tried to do the social gathering thing before, but more at a kid-oriented audience.

01:18:16.392 --> 01:18:20.794
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's things like, okay, remember when they released those 101 Dalmatian toys in the Happy Meals?

01:18:20.994 --> 01:18:21.274
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes.

01:18:21.414 --> 01:18:21.694
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

01:18:21.815 --> 01:18:24.436
[SPEAKER_06]: And they would have like Tuesday trade night or whatever.

01:18:24.876 --> 01:18:26.177
[SPEAKER_06]: And sure, it was a bunch of little kids.

01:18:26.437 --> 01:18:28.698
[SPEAKER_06]: But do you know who was really trading that stuff?

01:18:30.293 --> 01:18:33.415
[SPEAKER_06]: Their parents were trading those 101 Dalmatians.

01:18:33.455 --> 01:18:34.136
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't the kids.

01:18:34.156 --> 01:18:35.057
[SPEAKER_06]: It was the damn parents.

01:18:35.077 --> 01:18:36.638
[SPEAKER_06]: Beanie Babies.

01:18:36.738 --> 01:18:37.558
[SPEAKER_06]: Beanie Babies.

01:18:37.638 --> 01:18:38.759
[SPEAKER_06]: McDonald's Beanie Babies.

01:18:38.899 --> 01:18:39.539
[SPEAKER_06]: Good God.

01:18:39.900 --> 01:18:41.060
[SPEAKER_15]: I used to work at McDonald's.

01:18:41.080 --> 01:18:42.301
[SPEAKER_06]: You used to work at McDonald's during that time, right?

01:18:42.321 --> 01:18:44.142
[SPEAKER_15]: I have all of the Beanie Babies in my room.

01:18:44.303 --> 01:18:44.703
[SPEAKER_15]: All of them.

01:18:45.183 --> 01:18:47.725
[SPEAKER_06]: Who would show up more at those Beanie Baby exchange nights?

01:18:47.765 --> 01:18:48.645
[SPEAKER_06]: Kids or their parents?

01:18:48.825 --> 01:18:49.266
[SPEAKER_06]: Soccer moms.

01:18:49.286 --> 01:18:51.027
[SPEAKER_08]: Soccer moms.

01:18:53.587 --> 01:18:53.907
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

01:18:54.048 --> 01:18:56.430
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, that's all the news I got for you tonight.

01:18:56.530 --> 01:19:01.995
[SPEAKER_08]: I should have some more in the coming weeks, but right now those are like the two major ones that are coming up.

01:19:02.015 --> 01:19:06.479
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, we appreciate you contributing positively to the show, unlike Extifer.

01:19:07.540 --> 01:19:10.543
[SPEAKER_15]: Bye, DK.

01:19:11.564 --> 01:19:12.024
[SPEAKER_15]: You too.

01:19:12.045 --> 01:19:13.226
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, bye, Dark Knight.

01:19:13.246 --> 01:19:13.786
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a good one.

01:19:14.106 --> 01:19:14.647
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

01:19:16.369 --> 01:19:17.430
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, Extifer.

01:19:17.970 --> 01:19:18.651
[SPEAKER_06]: Kisses.

01:19:21.482 --> 01:19:22.203
[SPEAKER_06]: TOTAL SILENCE

01:19:35.805 --> 01:19:45.672
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I felt kind of sad when I discovered Captain Jack was dead, because the first time I played his song was Captain Jack 3rd Mix Grandale.

01:19:46.953 --> 01:19:48.394
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people's first songs.

01:19:50.355 --> 01:19:52.457
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of people's first Captain Jack song, definitely.

01:19:53.437 --> 01:20:01.263
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and I just really liked the song, and I liked it even better when I heard the full version, because I just thought it was awesome.

01:20:01.983 --> 01:20:05.446
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was just wondering, could you please get Captain Jack Little Boy on there?

01:20:06.070 --> 01:20:08.851
[SPEAKER_06]: We will work in Captain Jack Little Boy on our next break.

01:20:08.911 --> 01:20:09.311
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.

01:20:10.271 --> 01:20:10.492
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.

01:20:10.952 --> 01:20:13.473
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

01:20:13.693 --> 01:20:15.513
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a pretty quick request there.

01:20:16.414 --> 01:20:16.994
[SPEAKER_06]: Play Little Boy.

01:20:17.054 --> 01:20:17.274
[SPEAKER_06]: Click.

01:20:19.215 --> 01:20:19.875
[SPEAKER_06]: We're fine.

01:20:19.935 --> 01:20:22.736
[SPEAKER_06]: Even if you're going to hang up and ditch, maybe I won't play it.

01:20:22.956 --> 01:20:24.096
[SPEAKER_15]: He just called ditched us.

01:20:24.456 --> 01:20:25.957
[SPEAKER_06]: He totally just called ditched us.

01:20:26.017 --> 01:20:26.477
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all right.

01:20:27.898 --> 01:20:29.098
[SPEAKER_06]: I know the Skype thing's new.

01:20:31.879 --> 01:20:34.400
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm surprised we don't get crank calls more on this program.

01:20:36.067 --> 01:20:36.827
[SPEAKER_26]: Don't say that!

01:20:36.867 --> 01:20:38.548
[SPEAKER_26]: People are actually going to do it now.

01:20:39.088 --> 01:20:41.709
[SPEAKER_06]: I scared them already because I told them we have ways of finding out who they are.

01:20:41.929 --> 01:20:46.710
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, if you want to listen to my show tomorrow, you can call Ditch Me.

01:20:47.150 --> 01:20:47.450
[SPEAKER_06]: It's cool.

01:20:47.510 --> 01:20:49.571
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let's go to another call.

01:20:49.931 --> 01:20:51.231
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go to another call.

01:20:51.351 --> 01:20:53.772
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange House Radio.

01:20:54.092 --> 01:20:54.432
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey.

01:20:54.452 --> 01:20:54.492
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi.

01:20:55.432 --> 01:20:56.812
[SPEAKER_27]: Is it actually working this time?

01:20:56.872 --> 01:20:57.953
[SPEAKER_06]: It is actually working.

01:20:58.013 --> 01:20:59.253
[SPEAKER_06]: I hear you loud and clear.

01:20:59.533 --> 01:21:00.873
[SPEAKER_06]: Who is this?

01:21:01.133 --> 01:21:01.854
[SPEAKER_27]: This is Roz.

01:21:01.994 --> 01:21:02.514
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, Roz.

01:21:02.534 --> 01:21:03.054
[SPEAKER_06]: What's on your mind?

01:21:04.740 --> 01:21:06.501
[SPEAKER_27]: Um, not too much.

01:21:08.183 --> 01:21:11.805
[SPEAKER_27]: I just got home from a fun experience.

01:21:12.806 --> 01:21:14.487
[SPEAKER_06]: Ooh, fun experience, huh?

01:21:14.807 --> 01:21:15.647
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell us more about it.

01:21:16.528 --> 01:21:25.494
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, I sat in church for an hour watching the bishop of the diocese say the rosary and sitting next to an old lady who wouldn't stop clearing her throat.

01:21:26.240 --> 01:21:28.402
[SPEAKER_06]: You have a very strange definition of fun experience.

01:21:30.243 --> 01:21:30.724
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to say.

01:21:30.744 --> 01:21:32.085
[SPEAKER_27]: It was annoying as shit.

01:21:32.305 --> 01:21:32.905
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, there you go.

01:21:32.925 --> 01:21:33.286
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

01:21:35.047 --> 01:21:35.808
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't lie to us.

01:21:35.908 --> 01:21:36.488
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't lie to us.

01:21:36.568 --> 01:21:38.490
[SPEAKER_06]: That was not a fun experience.

01:21:38.510 --> 01:21:42.833
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a, I think I want to crawl under the pew experience.

01:21:42.913 --> 01:21:44.094
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, yeah.

01:21:44.214 --> 01:21:47.537
[SPEAKER_27]: Afterwards, I ran into the house and took a shower.

01:21:47.557 --> 01:21:49.339
[SPEAKER_27]: So, I'm good.

01:21:53.141 --> 01:21:55.942
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki's sitting in the back there, by the way, going, now we're talking.

01:21:56.282 --> 01:21:56.943
[SPEAKER_06]: Pervert.

01:21:58.823 --> 01:21:59.164
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, yeah.

01:21:59.304 --> 01:21:59.984
[SPEAKER_27]: Fantasize.

01:22:00.344 --> 01:22:01.364
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

01:22:01.925 --> 01:22:02.685
[SPEAKER_26]: I encourage it.

01:22:03.005 --> 01:22:07.527
[SPEAKER_26]: Now I wonder why I associate with these guys.

01:22:07.967 --> 01:22:08.387
[SPEAKER_26]: Never mind.

01:22:08.427 --> 01:22:09.227
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, come on.

01:22:09.247 --> 01:22:10.228
[SPEAKER_26]: You know you like it.

01:22:10.288 --> 01:22:13.269
[SPEAKER_06]: To our credit, two of us are gay, you know.

01:22:14.318 --> 01:22:15.679
[SPEAKER_06]: It's okay, I can hang out with the women.

01:22:16.701 --> 01:22:17.061
[SPEAKER_15]: It's cool.

01:22:17.722 --> 01:22:18.262
[SPEAKER_06]: I like women.

01:22:18.703 --> 01:22:19.704
[SPEAKER_15]: I like women too.

01:22:19.724 --> 01:22:20.945
[SPEAKER_15]: They're fun to shop with, anyway.

01:22:21.185 --> 01:22:22.226
[SPEAKER_15]: And play around with.

01:22:23.267 --> 01:22:24.629
[SPEAKER_15]: Play around meaning shop with.

01:22:24.649 --> 01:22:26.451
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:22:26.551 --> 01:22:26.971
[SPEAKER_06]: God.

01:22:27.572 --> 01:22:28.653
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, now he changed it.

[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, let's let our caller talk a little more there.

[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, caller.

01:22:32.557 --> 01:22:36.381
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm hitting the chat, and like, everyone seems horribly surprised that I'm a girl.

01:22:37.621 --> 01:22:51.153
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what, for some reason it's like this big thing like OMG a gamer girl Although like, I thought that was like years old now There's plenty of gamer girls out there now Actually, when I first walked into that chat room Are you a guy?

01:22:51.673 --> 01:23:01.222
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, no Wow, no, there's plenty of girls that play video games of all types now And you have a super sounding voice too

01:23:03.613 --> 01:23:04.734
[SPEAKER_15]: I just thought I would say that.

01:23:04.794 --> 01:23:06.215
[SPEAKER_15]: Geez, don't look at me like that, Skye.

01:23:06.475 --> 01:23:07.516
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just saying.

01:23:07.536 --> 01:23:10.198
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, okay, if you want to pay the callers a compliment, not a problem.

01:23:10.238 --> 01:23:18.324
[SPEAKER_15]: It sounds like you would be a good addition to listening to my show starting tomorrow at 7 o'clock PST.

01:23:19.144 --> 01:23:19.965
[SPEAKER_06]: He ain't too proud to beg.

01:23:21.606 --> 01:23:26.349
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, I'm all up in the East Coast, so, you know.

[SPEAKER_06]: So, like, 10 o'clock?

01:23:28.331 --> 01:23:30.032
[SPEAKER_06]: She's got to go to bed by the time your show comes on.

01:23:30.592 --> 01:23:32.454
[SPEAKER_15]: What do you have going on in the morning on Tuesday?

01:23:32.494 --> 01:23:32.794
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

01:23:33.732 --> 01:23:35.473
[SPEAKER_06]: Stop berating the listeners, Extover.

01:23:35.853 --> 01:23:36.193
[SPEAKER_06]: Stop it.

01:23:36.954 --> 01:23:38.335
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to talk serious here for a minute.

01:23:38.355 --> 01:23:40.716
[SPEAKER_06]: It's after primetime program.

01:23:40.776 --> 01:23:42.037
[SPEAKER_06]: Extover, I will take your mic away.

01:23:43.498 --> 01:23:45.479
[SPEAKER_06]: Ross, I need to know your thoughts on Captain Jack.

01:23:46.700 --> 01:23:55.805
[SPEAKER_27]: You know, I had no idea until after I got home from the church and being coughed on by that old lady.

01:23:56.745 --> 01:24:02.849
[SPEAKER_27]: I came back, I checked the site, and I was like, holy shit, because I had no idea.

01:24:04.172 --> 01:24:04.873
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what else to say.

01:24:24.921 --> 01:24:26.362
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, Roz, well, thanks for the call.

01:24:26.602 --> 01:24:30.084
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're going to let you go so we can get to some more calls because our line is lighting up tonight.

01:24:30.144 --> 01:24:31.625
[SPEAKER_06]: But thanks for calling.

01:24:32.185 --> 01:24:32.746
[SPEAKER_06]: And have a good one.

01:24:32.766 --> 01:24:34.106
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, I'm glad it worked this time.

01:24:34.366 --> 01:24:34.767
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.

01:24:34.787 --> 01:24:35.387
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad, too.

01:24:35.547 --> 01:24:36.067
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad to hear it.

01:24:36.828 --> 01:24:37.648
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, take care, Roz.

[SPEAKER_27]: Bye-bye.

01:24:40.710 --> 01:24:41.450
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go to another call.

01:24:42.311 --> 01:24:42.891
[SPEAKER_06]: One more, at least.

01:24:43.211 --> 01:24:43.992
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

01:24:45.563 --> 01:24:48.245
[SPEAKER_18]: Hey, this is GS191 in the chat rooms.

01:24:48.585 --> 01:24:50.746
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, GS191 in the chat rooms.

01:24:50.806 --> 01:24:51.126
[SPEAKER_06]: What's up?

01:24:52.327 --> 01:24:52.767
[SPEAKER_18]: Not much.

01:24:53.188 --> 01:24:56.350
[SPEAKER_18]: I just heard about Captain Jack just now.

01:24:57.030 --> 01:24:58.851
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm very, very shocked.

01:24:58.931 --> 01:25:01.292
[SPEAKER_06]: Amazing that people actually get their news from our show.

01:25:01.593 --> 01:25:04.454
[SPEAKER_06]: I always thought that we were the redundancy of the Internet.

01:25:04.474 --> 01:25:06.916
[SPEAKER_06]: But no, that's interesting.

01:25:06.976 --> 01:25:09.297
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, I'm sorry you had to find out through our show.

01:25:11.078 --> 01:25:12.259
[SPEAKER_06]: But what do you think?

01:25:12.319 --> 01:25:13.380
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's kind of sudden, huh?

01:25:14.440 --> 01:25:19.263
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I remember back in the really, really old days of, like, the third mix, Korean version 2.

01:25:19.463 --> 01:25:20.823
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, yes.

01:25:21.063 --> 01:25:21.424
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, yes.

01:25:22.684 --> 01:25:25.346
[SPEAKER_18]: I did not... Shit.

01:25:27.167 --> 01:25:28.107
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, you could tell it was the first time.

01:25:28.147 --> 01:25:28.507
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all right.

01:25:29.028 --> 01:25:29.548
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

01:25:29.808 --> 01:25:30.848
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just internet radio.

01:25:30.929 --> 01:25:32.890
[SPEAKER_06]: No one expects anything, so... Yeah.

01:25:32.930 --> 01:25:33.650
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all good, man.

01:25:34.030 --> 01:25:37.052
[SPEAKER_06]: Look, if we can get a show, anything can happen.

01:25:37.072 --> 01:25:37.452
[SPEAKER_06]: If I can get a show?

01:25:37.532 --> 01:25:41.574
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, if Extaper can get a show, anything goes on the internet, so feel free.

01:25:41.594 --> 01:25:42.174
[SPEAKER_06]: Say anything.

01:25:42.194 --> 01:25:42.534
[SPEAKER_06]: Just relax.

01:25:42.635 --> 01:25:42.795
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything.

01:25:42.855 --> 01:25:43.255
[SPEAKER_15]: Anything.

01:25:45.745 --> 01:25:50.970
[SPEAKER_18]: I remember playing the Ray song on the third mix, and that was my first Captain Jack song, and I loved it.

01:25:52.892 --> 01:26:01.520
[SPEAKER_18]: When I got home, I frantically tried to search for the long version, found it, and put it on repeat on my CD player for a long, long time.

01:26:02.481 --> 01:26:05.103
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what a lot of people do with DDR music when they first play the game.

01:26:05.983 --> 01:26:09.266
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you can see the life of a DDR noob.

01:26:09.627 --> 01:26:18.314
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like they play the game, then they find that song they like, then they burn their first DDR CD and they listen to it over and over and over again in the car, and then they're playing it to all their friends.

01:26:18.414 --> 01:26:20.856
[SPEAKER_26]: Like, listen to this really cheesy DDR music.

01:26:21.176 --> 01:26:21.957
[SPEAKER_06]: That was me, anyway.

01:26:22.657 --> 01:26:24.699
[SPEAKER_26]: As Angel turns bright red.

01:26:24.939 --> 01:26:26.060
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that's what Angel did, too.

01:26:26.160 --> 01:26:27.261
[SPEAKER_06]: You know it, you know it, guys.

01:26:28.422 --> 01:26:29.083
[SPEAKER_26]: Because Angel...

01:26:30.743 --> 01:26:30.963
[SPEAKER_26]: Angel

01:26:44.666 --> 01:26:46.227
[SPEAKER_18]: and I've been playing it non-stop.

01:26:47.748 --> 01:26:49.069
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a great game, it really is.

01:26:49.349 --> 01:26:50.449
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, it's a great game.

01:26:50.750 --> 01:26:52.110
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm looking forward to Ultramix 3.

01:26:52.591 --> 01:26:55.172
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be a heck of a fall with the Bomani releases.

01:26:55.192 --> 01:26:55.892
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm very excited.

01:26:56.893 --> 01:26:57.533
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh yeah, me too.

01:26:58.074 --> 01:26:59.694
[SPEAKER_06]: Not just Captain Jack, but the whole variety.

01:26:59.915 --> 01:27:01.896
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the MySpace DDR mix.

01:27:02.676 --> 01:27:04.257
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be a fun time.

01:27:04.958 --> 01:27:07.159
[SPEAKER_18]: God, God, I hate Good Charlotte.

01:27:07.179 --> 01:27:08.520
[SPEAKER_18]: I want them to burn in hell.

01:27:08.860 --> 01:27:11.261
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, but there's always going to be one song on the mix.

01:27:11.361 --> 01:27:14.202
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of like in Ultramix 2 there was La Cucaracha.

01:27:14.362 --> 01:27:15.983
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, seriously, who the fuck plays that song?

01:27:16.203 --> 01:27:18.944
[SPEAKER_15]: I want them to go to heaven, because I'm already going to hell.

01:27:18.984 --> 01:27:19.745
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't want them there.

01:27:19.765 --> 01:27:21.886
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, good point.

01:27:23.366 --> 01:27:26.148
[SPEAKER_06]: On that note, is there anything else you wanted to share with our listeners, GS191?

01:27:28.166 --> 01:27:28.786
[SPEAKER_18]: No, not really.

01:27:29.567 --> 01:27:32.930
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, thanks for the call.

01:27:33.690 --> 01:27:34.151
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, thank you.

01:27:34.311 --> 01:27:36.393
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, and thanks for listening, and call back.

01:27:36.453 --> 01:27:37.093
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't be a stranger.

01:27:37.914 --> 01:27:38.174
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

01:27:38.755 --> 01:27:39.115
[SPEAKER_06]: Take care.

01:27:39.155 --> 01:27:39.335
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye.

01:27:39.556 --> 01:27:39.816
[SPEAKER_06]: Later.

01:27:41.137 --> 01:27:41.698
[SPEAKER_06]: One more call.

01:27:41.758 --> 01:27:43.079
[SPEAKER_06]: We're just lighting up with calls tonight.

01:27:43.099 --> 01:27:43.779
[SPEAKER_06]: This is crazy.

01:27:44.420 --> 01:27:46.242
[SPEAKER_06]: Getting this new phone number was probably the best thing we ever did.

01:27:46.362 --> 01:27:47.283
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.

01:27:47.323 --> 01:27:50.786
[SPEAKER_22]: Hey, it's me, the legend, Zaku.

01:27:51.046 --> 01:27:52.067
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, Zaku, what's up?

01:27:53.206 --> 01:27:58.568
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, finally got to the phone after, you know, after trying to hammer Skype through, you know, through IPC.

01:27:59.308 --> 01:28:02.410
[SPEAKER_06]: Zaku, I don't know what, Zaku, we've been hammered like all night long.

01:28:02.450 --> 01:28:03.090
[SPEAKER_06]: It's crazy.

01:28:03.170 --> 01:28:03.490
[SPEAKER_06]: What's up?

01:28:04.530 --> 01:28:07.852
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, obviously you want my reaction to Captain Jack's death.

01:28:07.872 --> 01:28:08.332
[SPEAKER_28]: Sure.

01:28:08.632 --> 01:28:10.593
[SPEAKER_22]: It's a shame, it's a shame.

01:28:10.613 --> 01:28:14.094
[SPEAKER_22]: I was, you know, I was pretty much shocked.

01:28:14.955 --> 01:28:19.636
[SPEAKER_22]: As soon as I came home that night and found, you know, and just found out, good DDR freak.

01:28:20.697 --> 01:28:20.997
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean...

01:28:22.277 --> 01:28:30.147
[SPEAKER_22]: How, I mean, this pretty much hit us quickly, you know, I mean, all these events happen within a matter of a week.

01:28:30.988 --> 01:28:38.898
[SPEAKER_22]: Monday he collapses and then a few days later he loses his life, he loses his battle to survive, so...

01:28:40.484 --> 01:28:45.227
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm putting up a link right now in the chat room that I managed to find from a thread in Bomani Style about the US version of Beatmania.

01:28:45.287 --> 01:28:46.487
[SPEAKER_06]: It involves EV games again.

01:29:09.662 --> 01:29:14.304
[SPEAKER_22]: They managed to get the date right, but the pricing, you might want to take a look at.

01:29:15.824 --> 01:29:19.605
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so Zaku posted a link in our chat room, which is available at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.

01:29:19.665 --> 01:29:25.628
[SPEAKER_06]: Click on chat, and he wants me to take a look at this, and check out what's going on on EBGames.com.

01:29:25.768 --> 01:29:26.148
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow!

01:29:26.708 --> 01:29:31.410
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so they're going to ship Beatmania for the PS2, and it's saying March 1st, 2006.

01:29:33.010 --> 01:29:34.150
[SPEAKER_06]: $49.99 is the price.

01:29:34.210 --> 01:29:35.151
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's interesting, though, because...

01:29:36.783 --> 01:29:41.050
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait a minute, $49.99 for the game and $49.99 for the bundle?

01:29:41.872 --> 01:29:43.394
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, I was saying the same shit too.

01:29:43.715 --> 01:29:48.964
[SPEAKER_22]: How come Konami, you know, I thought they were going to charge like $60 or $70 for that thing.

01:29:50.029 --> 01:29:55.972
[SPEAKER_22]: Where they're pretty much shooting themselves in the foot when they're letting folks get away with a $50 ticket.

01:29:55.992 --> 01:29:57.633
[SPEAKER_22]: Let me put it this way.

01:30:18.283 --> 01:30:20.865
[SPEAKER_06]: The game's announced for January and February.

01:30:20.905 --> 01:30:22.826
[SPEAKER_06]: We have about 24 of them.

01:30:23.287 --> 01:30:25.108
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, March we have two.

01:30:25.808 --> 01:30:27.409
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I'm going to tell you this much.

01:30:27.890 --> 01:30:33.033
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't have any info when it's coming out yet because we haven't even gotten any info when that stuff's coming out, let alone other stuff.

01:30:33.253 --> 01:30:36.255
[SPEAKER_06]: There's stuff getting announced left and right we have no dates for, so it doesn't matter.

01:30:37.516 --> 01:30:40.198
[SPEAKER_06]: It is an interesting discovery, but I don't think it holds any weight.

01:30:40.418 --> 01:30:41.599
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just like the date for Halo 3.

01:30:41.779 --> 01:30:43.240
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, no one knows when that's coming out.

01:30:43.260 --> 01:30:45.101
[SPEAKER_06]: They just put it on there saying take pre-orders.

01:30:45.262 --> 01:30:45.642
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

01:30:45.662 --> 01:30:45.862
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

01:30:47.408 --> 01:31:02.998
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, but besides, well, besides that, you know, obviously, basically by the time I called you last night, you know, Digital Life was over, but I didn't manage to get the results of the last few tournaments.

01:31:03.679 --> 01:31:05.460
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, what happened with the rest of Digital Life?

01:31:06.360 --> 01:31:12.644
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, one of the, one of the, this cat I know, you know, who played DDR managed to win like, he managed to win two grand.

01:31:13.925 --> 01:31:16.527
[SPEAKER_22]: One of the, one of the players from within, from within New York City.

01:31:17.560 --> 01:31:21.101
[SPEAKER_22]: Very cool, congratulations.

01:31:25.182 --> 01:31:31.824
[SPEAKER_22]: But so far, you know, Sunday was probably the worst day you went, and I know people learn their lessons well.

01:31:32.725 --> 01:31:35.806
[SPEAKER_22]: The only good days are the ones that they have to, that they go freestyling.

01:31:37.006 --> 01:31:38.006
[SPEAKER_22]: Keep that in mind, folks.

01:31:38.787 --> 01:31:43.228
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, if I go to Digital Life next year, I'll keep that in mind, that Sunday is not the day for me to be there.

01:31:43.288 --> 01:31:44.789
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll take my flight home on Sunday next year.

01:31:44.809 --> 01:31:45.129
[SPEAKER_22]: You know,

01:31:46.873 --> 01:31:48.334
[SPEAKER_22]: Next year is going to be four days.

01:31:48.394 --> 01:31:54.096
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm assuming that the first day is going to be like a free play event and then the next three days is going to be the tournament.

01:31:54.376 --> 01:31:57.437
[SPEAKER_06]: If I go to Digital Life next year, though, it ain't going to be just for the tournament.

01:31:57.557 --> 01:31:58.498
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to take it all in.

01:31:58.558 --> 01:32:00.639
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, of course I'll go to the tournament, but you know.

01:32:01.879 --> 01:32:03.780
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, just make sure, now you know.

01:32:04.280 --> 01:32:07.201
[SPEAKER_22]: Now you know that it's in the middle of October next year.

01:32:07.382 --> 01:32:08.682
[SPEAKER_06]: And knowing is half the battle.

01:32:09.562 --> 01:32:10.903
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, it's GDI, Joe.

01:32:11.743 --> 01:32:13.604
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, anything else you want to share with our listeners, Zach?

01:32:13.664 --> 01:32:15.705
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got to get to more calls because we've got people hammering us.

01:32:16.569 --> 01:32:17.929
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, that's about it, man.

01:32:18.049 --> 01:32:18.830
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

01:32:20.270 --> 01:32:20.950
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, have a good one.

01:32:21.390 --> 01:32:22.270
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for the call, Zaku.

01:32:22.610 --> 01:32:23.291
[SPEAKER_08]: Goodbye.

01:32:24.071 --> 01:32:24.551
[SPEAKER_08]: Later.

01:32:26.591 --> 01:32:27.551
[SPEAKER_06]: We gotta get some more calls.

01:32:28.472 --> 01:32:29.312
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange House Radio.

01:32:30.392 --> 01:32:30.932
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, what's up?

01:32:31.012 --> 01:32:33.833
[SPEAKER_06]: It's DJ Ranma S. Hello, DJ Ranma S. What's on your mind?

01:32:34.553 --> 01:32:34.913
[SPEAKER_07]: Not much.

01:32:34.933 --> 01:32:36.933
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanted to say a couple things about the captain.

01:32:37.334 --> 01:32:39.274
[SPEAKER_06]: You cosplayed the captain, didn't you?

01:32:40.214 --> 01:32:41.654
[SPEAKER_07]: No, but I'm planning on it.

01:32:41.734 --> 01:32:43.975
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I thought you said you had cosplayed him at one point.

01:32:44.443 --> 01:32:47.726
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I said I plan to hopefully maybe Captain Con next year.

01:32:47.826 --> 01:32:48.267
[SPEAKER_06]: My bad.

01:32:48.307 --> 01:32:48.707
[SPEAKER_06]: My bad.

01:32:49.668 --> 01:32:53.672
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, prepare to be surrounded by white women because that's what happens with Captain Jack.

01:32:53.892 --> 01:32:54.472
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, I love it.

01:32:55.093 --> 01:32:55.473
[SPEAKER_06]: I love it.

01:32:57.523 --> 01:33:02.326
[SPEAKER_26]: Which is why he told me on... Oh, never mind, I'm not exactly a white animal.

01:33:02.346 --> 01:33:04.508
[SPEAKER_26]: Close enough, close enough.

01:33:04.648 --> 01:33:05.549
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, it doesn't matter.

01:33:06.109 --> 01:33:09.351
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously, we're just kidding, you know, joking around when we say stuff like that.

01:33:09.531 --> 01:33:12.053
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously, you know, it's all about people.

01:33:12.073 --> 01:33:12.513
[SPEAKER_06]: Hot bitches.

01:33:12.934 --> 01:33:13.294
[SPEAKER_06]: People.

01:33:13.434 --> 01:33:14.655
[SPEAKER_06]: Hot bitches of all types.

01:33:15.475 --> 01:33:19.178
[SPEAKER_26]: Actually, when he told me, I thought, you know, I was like,

01:33:19.761 --> 01:33:21.302
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you for telling me, I appreciate that

01:33:46.480 --> 01:33:46.920
[SPEAKER_06]: No problem.

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.801
[SPEAKER_07]: So anything else you want to share about the whole Captain Jack thing?

01:33:50.361 --> 01:33:51.302
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, a couple things.

01:33:52.802 --> 01:34:02.666
[SPEAKER_07]: One thing, Captain Jack, it means a lot to me because at An Amazement, I did a walk on as Naval Barrett to End the Navy, which is one of my personal favorite songs.

01:34:03.786 --> 01:34:05.967
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, it kind of,

01:34:06.394 --> 01:34:07.194
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:34:19.506 --> 01:34:26.850
[SPEAKER_06]: The circumstance and the fact that he was just a fun party guy and died at a young age just kind of makes you go, life sucks.

01:34:27.210 --> 01:34:27.810
[SPEAKER_06]: Life sucks.

01:34:28.711 --> 01:34:35.834
[SPEAKER_15]: I was just going to say, everybody that calls in, they have a memory of some song that they've heard before.

01:34:36.715 --> 01:34:41.857
[SPEAKER_15]: That obviously this guy was a strong presence for you all when you guys started getting into DDR.

01:34:42.178 --> 01:34:42.998
[SPEAKER_15]: So that is sad.

01:34:43.778 --> 01:34:46.720
[SPEAKER_15]: Wow, you said something profound on this show.

01:34:46.760 --> 01:34:47.080
[SPEAKER_06]: I did.

01:34:47.180 --> 01:34:48.020
[SPEAKER_06]: I can be profound.

01:34:48.040 --> 01:34:48.661
[SPEAKER_06]: Holy fuck!

01:34:49.912 --> 01:34:51.373
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody note the date and time.

01:34:51.513 --> 01:34:52.754
[SPEAKER_06]: No, you're absolutely right.

01:34:52.874 --> 01:34:54.696
[SPEAKER_06]: Someone stop the presses.

01:34:55.256 --> 01:35:00.720
[SPEAKER_06]: Because Captain Jack is so, he's got such a strong personality and his songs are very unique.

01:35:01.200 --> 01:35:05.604
[SPEAKER_06]: Like him or not, you know a Captain Jack song when you hear it because it sounds like somebody's barking orders at you.

01:35:06.004 --> 01:35:11.288
[SPEAKER_06]: And people remember that with DDR and people have such fond memories about DDR and playing DDR with their friends.

01:35:11.528 --> 01:35:14.791
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of like how I was saying in the opening of the show when, you know, only you.

01:35:15.191 --> 01:35:17.533
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody would get down and, you know, throw all your hands up.

01:35:17.553 --> 01:35:18.053
[SPEAKER_06]: Hands up.

01:35:18.093 --> 01:35:18.994
[SPEAKER_06]: And everybody would do it.

01:35:19.054 --> 01:35:19.314
[SPEAKER_06]: And like,

01:35:19.674 --> 01:35:19.875
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

01:35:37.059 --> 01:35:37.539
[SPEAKER_06]: You're welcome.

01:35:38.159 --> 01:35:39.540
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, Ranma, I didn't mean to.

01:35:39.560 --> 01:35:39.860
[SPEAKER_06]: It's okay.

01:35:40.560 --> 01:35:41.440
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything else you want to share?

01:35:42.041 --> 01:35:43.521
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, two things before I go.

01:35:43.601 --> 01:35:43.921
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

01:35:43.941 --> 01:35:47.502
[SPEAKER_07]: Another reason why Captain Jack needs something to me, I want to post this link.

01:35:47.882 --> 01:35:53.504
[SPEAKER_07]: Someone, YTMND, as Sailor Barrett, and if you click on it, you hear In the Navy.

01:35:54.604 --> 01:35:57.005
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm afraid to bring that up because YTMND... It's a good one.

01:35:57.165 --> 01:35:58.405
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a good one, seriously.

01:35:58.485 --> 01:36:03.307
[SPEAKER_06]: But my computer doesn't like YTMND, so I don't know if I can pull it up, but chat room, go for it.

01:36:04.634 --> 01:36:08.896
[SPEAKER_07]: and right here, standing in front of my computer, I have a can of Budweiser.

01:36:09.196 --> 01:36:10.496
[SPEAKER_07]: Crack one open for the captain.

01:36:12.197 --> 01:36:13.457
[SPEAKER_05]: Pour a 40 for me.

01:36:15.278 --> 01:36:16.638
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn, I'm not that ghetto, son.

01:36:19.519 --> 01:36:19.919
[SPEAKER_07]: I am.

01:36:19.939 --> 01:36:25.381
[SPEAKER_07]: A whiff is like that, but you're going to have a good old time at CatDew.

01:36:25.901 --> 01:36:27.142
[SPEAKER_06]: Hell yeah, hell yeah.

01:36:27.182 --> 01:36:28.602
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe I should cosplay as the captain.

01:36:30.063 --> 01:36:30.163
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

01:36:33.250 --> 01:36:34.531
[SPEAKER_07]: I know some single gay guys.

01:36:51.670 --> 01:36:52.250
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm just kidding.

01:36:52.310 --> 01:36:52.991
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, let's get to it.

01:36:53.912 --> 01:36:54.512
[SPEAKER_06]: One more call.

01:36:54.552 --> 01:36:58.595
[SPEAKER_06]: I keep saying that, but I keep seeing all these names that have been hammering us.

01:36:58.895 --> 01:36:59.115
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

01:36:59.355 --> 01:37:06.040
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been seeing all these names hammering us all night long, and I know that people want to say stuff about the captain, so I feel an obligation to get to all these calls.

01:37:06.340 --> 01:37:07.701
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is the last one for now.

01:37:08.141 --> 01:37:09.082
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Arizona Radio.

01:37:11.123 --> 01:37:11.944
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, wow, I'm the last one?

01:37:11.984 --> 01:37:12.785
[SPEAKER_14]: I feel privileged.

01:37:12.825 --> 01:37:13.865
[SPEAKER_14]: It's SSJ100 Matt.

01:37:13.885 --> 01:37:18.469
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I see you've been hammering us for like 30 minutes, so I feel bad for you, so I wanted to let you through.

01:37:18.529 --> 01:37:18.889
[SPEAKER_06]: What's up?

01:37:19.673 --> 01:37:20.553
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm pretty pathetic.

01:37:21.754 --> 01:37:22.374
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all good.

01:37:22.474 --> 01:37:23.074
[SPEAKER_06]: We appreciate it.

01:37:24.535 --> 01:37:24.995
[SPEAKER_14]: No, nothing.

01:37:25.035 --> 01:37:29.217
[SPEAKER_14]: I just found out the bad news by Captain Jack after coming back from seeing Doom.

01:37:29.697 --> 01:37:31.098
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's two bad things in a row.

01:37:32.058 --> 01:37:33.279
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, shit.

01:37:33.299 --> 01:37:35.280
[SPEAKER_06]: You know things come in threes, too.

01:37:35.460 --> 01:37:36.720
[SPEAKER_06]: So brace yourself.

01:37:36.760 --> 01:37:38.421
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you're listening to this program, I suppose.

01:37:38.521 --> 01:37:39.661
[SPEAKER_06]: And warts.

01:37:39.782 --> 01:37:40.082
[SPEAKER_15]: Who knows?

01:37:45.789 --> 01:37:48.932
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't have sex in the next 24 hours, because you're bound to catch something.

01:37:49.273 --> 01:37:51.915
[SPEAKER_06]: Because bad things come in threes, so be careful.

01:37:52.876 --> 01:37:59.183
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I'm about to go play the new Budokai Tenkaichi with my roommate after this.

01:37:59.583 --> 01:38:00.764
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to blow up your console.

01:38:01.745 --> 01:38:02.746
[SPEAKER_14]: Or I'll get raped.

01:38:06.570 --> 01:38:06.970
[SPEAKER_06]: Either way.

01:38:07.010 --> 01:38:08.292
[SPEAKER_06]: What are your thoughts on Captain Jack?

01:38:12.246 --> 01:38:13.429
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just disappointed.

01:38:13.450 --> 01:38:18.303
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not going to hear any new songs from anymore on any of the new DDRs.

01:38:20.370 --> 01:38:20.771
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

01:38:21.391 --> 01:38:24.474
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe he's like Tupac and he has a bunch of songs that haven't been released.

01:38:24.754 --> 01:38:25.615
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you never know.

01:38:26.756 --> 01:38:27.797
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe he's still alive somewhere.

01:38:27.837 --> 01:38:30.120
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe the whole damn thing is a conspiracy.

01:38:30.880 --> 01:38:31.921
[SPEAKER_15]: They'll find him in Mexico.

01:38:33.082 --> 01:38:34.764
[SPEAKER_15]: Mexico, Canada.

01:38:34.984 --> 01:38:37.126
[SPEAKER_06]: I can see the hate mail coming in right now.

01:38:37.146 --> 01:38:38.287
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything else on your mind?

01:38:42.312 --> 01:38:45.315
[SPEAKER_06]: Nope, other than Doom was a disappointment.

01:38:47.036 --> 01:38:50.158
[SPEAKER_06]: Was that first person stuff as stupid as it looked in the preview?

01:38:51.099 --> 01:38:58.023
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, to tell you the truth, they only really had it for about two to five minutes of the last part of the movie.

01:38:58.043 --> 01:38:58.364
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

01:38:58.644 --> 01:39:00.385
[SPEAKER_06]: That still seems like a long time.

01:39:00.465 --> 01:39:02.346
[SPEAKER_06]: Five minutes is a goddamn long time.

01:39:02.667 --> 01:39:06.489
[SPEAKER_15]: Seriously, though, the way that they hyped it up, it was supposed to be like the big thing in the movie.

01:39:06.509 --> 01:39:08.631
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, thank God, because that shit looked cheesy.

01:39:09.716 --> 01:39:11.998
[SPEAKER_15]: It did, but you know... Yeah, it was cheesy.

01:39:12.739 --> 01:39:19.364
[SPEAKER_06]: And they did not have... Somebody in chat, I don't know if it was you or somebody else, I just saw it fly by in the chat room earlier, said that the flying eyeballs are not in the movie.

01:39:20.305 --> 01:39:21.606
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah, I said that.

01:39:21.626 --> 01:39:22.506
[SPEAKER_14]: That's bullshit.

01:39:23.207 --> 01:39:29.052
[SPEAKER_14]: I was expecting like flaming skulls and skeletons with rocket launchers on their shoulders, but...

01:39:29.602 --> 01:39:34.886
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it was Roger Ebert that said that the best thing in the film was, like, the beginning Universal logo.

01:39:35.287 --> 01:39:37.428
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, there was some big thing that they did at the beginning.

01:39:37.829 --> 01:39:40.111
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, was that the best thing in the film?

01:39:43.633 --> 01:39:47.637
[SPEAKER_14]: No, you know, they had a couple subtle things in the movie.

01:39:49.015 --> 01:39:52.857
[SPEAKER_06]: The best thing about Doom will probably be the trailer for Harry Potter beforehand.

01:39:52.877 --> 01:39:53.697
[SPEAKER_06]: Harry Potter, oh my god.

01:39:54.158 --> 01:39:54.498
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay.

01:39:55.058 --> 01:39:55.378
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

01:39:56.499 --> 01:39:56.859
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

01:39:57.839 --> 01:40:02.822
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, Matt, we gotta go because we gotta get to a break here because we're tired and we've been taking calls for like the past hour.

01:40:02.942 --> 01:40:03.562
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

01:40:03.822 --> 01:40:04.523
[SPEAKER_06]: But have a good one.

01:40:04.543 --> 01:40:05.483
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for calling in, okay?

01:40:06.343 --> 01:40:06.964
[SPEAKER_06]: Peace out, man.

01:40:06.984 --> 01:40:07.504
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, later.

01:40:07.984 --> 01:40:08.665
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep, bye.

01:40:09.285 --> 01:40:09.485
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye.

01:40:11.445 --> 01:40:12.665
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you guys for calling in.

01:40:12.966 --> 01:40:14.066
[SPEAKER_06]: Whole shitload of calls tonight.

01:40:14.086 --> 01:40:14.706
[SPEAKER_06]: We appreciate it.

01:40:14.746 --> 01:40:15.527
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry to those of you guys.

01:40:15.567 --> 01:40:17.207
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope we got to everybody at least once.

01:40:17.287 --> 01:40:19.648
[SPEAKER_06]: I really, really apologize to those of you guys we didn't get to.

01:40:20.348 --> 01:40:21.429
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll get to you guys a little bit later.

01:40:21.829 --> 01:40:22.729
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully, if we have time.

01:40:23.209 --> 01:40:24.890
[SPEAKER_06]: And try not to kill yourself on the way out, Xtfer.

01:40:26.511 --> 01:40:27.211
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, anyway.

01:40:28.391 --> 01:40:29.212
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go to a break.

01:40:29.312 --> 01:40:30.052
[SPEAKER_06]: Damn, I need a break.

01:40:30.072 --> 01:40:32.293
[SPEAKER_06]: And I promised somebody we could hear Little Boy.

01:40:32.973 --> 01:40:35.294
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're going to play that song from DDR Max 2.

01:40:37.373 --> 01:40:42.017
[SPEAKER_06]: And when we come back, we will probably get into the cage match and talk about some other stuff as well.

01:40:42.857 --> 01:40:44.639
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's go to a break.

01:40:44.879 --> 01:40:47.581
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that microphone is being awful.

01:40:50.703 --> 01:40:52.505
[SPEAKER_15]: It was left on for some reason.

01:40:53.185 --> 01:40:53.425
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

01:40:54.606 --> 01:40:55.347
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to play this.

01:40:55.427 --> 01:40:57.248
[SPEAKER_06]: It's actually the full version of Little Boy.

01:40:57.288 --> 01:41:00.571
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll play that and a couple other little Captain Jack songs, and we'll be back after this.

01:41:05.993 --> 01:41:11.355
[SPEAKER_10]: Dream on my little boy, dream on my little boy, dream on my little boy, go out and have some joy.

01:41:57.463 --> 01:41:59.492
[SPEAKER_10]: Dream on my little boy, dream on my little boy

01:42:46.857 --> 01:42:58.648
[SPEAKER_10]: Dream on my little boy, dream on my little boy, dream on my little boy, go out and have some joy Little boy, dream on my little boy, dream on my little boy, go out and have some joy

01:43:17.746 --> 01:43:21.648
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, little boy, do you think you're Mr. Right?

01:43:21.688 --> 01:43:28.832
[SPEAKER_10]: A girl like me still wants to choose the man, the only one she wants to be Realize reality, you're not Mr. Right Running on that one big street alone

01:43:51.295 --> 01:43:51.496
Cool!

01:44:15.538 --> 01:44:17.079
Thanks for watching!

01:48:21.318 --> 01:48:22.200
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

01:48:35.768 --> 01:48:44.331
[SPEAKER_29]: Hi-ho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter V, the letter A, and the number 59.

01:48:44.371 --> 01:48:50.494
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

01:48:50.574 --> 01:48:51.354
[SPEAKER_06]: Listen, Frog!

01:48:52.495 --> 01:48:53.335
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi-yo!

01:48:54.595 --> 01:48:55.236
[SPEAKER_06]: I love the Muppets.

01:48:55.836 --> 01:48:58.557
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, anyway, we're back on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:48:59.983 --> 01:49:08.733
[SPEAKER_06]: In that break, you heard Captain Jack with Little Boy, the original, and oh my gosh, the chat room freaked out because I wasn't playing the remix that's in DDR, and it was the original.

01:49:09.754 --> 01:49:12.558
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, it gives you guys a chance to hear maybe something you haven't heard before.

01:49:13.018 --> 01:49:13.499
[SPEAKER_06]: Imagine that.

01:49:13.879 --> 01:49:19.526
[SPEAKER_06]: Aiko Aiko from DanceMania21, and Dancing Pompokolin from DDR Fifth Mix.

01:49:20.489 --> 01:49:20.949
[SPEAKER_06]: Good times.

01:49:21.189 --> 01:49:26.172
[SPEAKER_06]: And did you notice, Extifer, I'm sure you noticed this, the lyrics in Ico Ico, did you hear Set Your Fag on Fire?

01:49:26.252 --> 01:49:26.532
[SPEAKER_06]: I did.

01:49:26.692 --> 01:49:27.973
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you pointed it out.

01:49:28.013 --> 01:49:32.455
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, at Captain Jack's request, we will be setting Extifer on fire at the end of the show.

01:49:34.476 --> 01:49:35.456
[SPEAKER_06]: How funny.

01:49:35.476 --> 01:49:36.657
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to set our fag on fire.

01:49:36.677 --> 01:49:39.498
[SPEAKER_06]: Take you with me, bitch.

01:49:43.981 --> 01:49:45.241
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to go over to Loki.

01:49:45.321 --> 01:49:46.542
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki's actually got some...

01:49:49.565 --> 01:49:59.289
[SPEAKER_06]: I was looking for that, because I don't see it.

01:50:00.269 --> 01:50:01.770
[SPEAKER_06]: It was there, but it's gone.

01:50:03.150 --> 01:50:12.854
[SPEAKER_06]: No, someone, of course, making games for the PSP, and the one that they had on there, which I can't find for the life of me, is called Button Mash Revolution.

01:50:14.375 --> 01:50:14.455
[SPEAKER_06]: It

01:50:16.207 --> 01:50:18.468
[SPEAKER_06]: Like DDR, but, you know, not.

01:50:20.968 --> 01:50:24.189
[SPEAKER_06]: And I can't find any info on it because the fucking links are gone.

01:50:24.309 --> 01:50:33.251
[SPEAKER_06]: So, fuck them for updating their stupid website and not having, like most websites do, you know, news archive where you can go to the next page and next page and next page.

01:50:33.891 --> 01:50:36.292
[SPEAKER_06]: No, we're too good for that.

01:50:37.212 --> 01:50:38.432
[SPEAKER_06]: So, fucking A, but...

01:50:39.963 --> 01:50:41.266
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it was really cool looking.

01:50:41.948 --> 01:50:46.458
[SPEAKER_06]: I wish I could talk more about it, but I can't find the goddamn link, so... Yay!

01:50:48.154 --> 01:50:49.635
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll go from here.

01:50:49.675 --> 01:50:50.756
[SPEAKER_06]: Live radio, boys and girls.

01:50:51.736 --> 01:50:53.437
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, I got Bomani-related news.

01:50:53.557 --> 01:50:54.138
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead.

01:50:54.238 --> 01:50:58.280
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I just remembered this, because something that was just said in the chat room reminded me of this.

01:50:58.701 --> 01:51:02.603
[SPEAKER_06]: You know they showed a little preview of the new Madonna video for Hung Up?

01:51:03.484 --> 01:51:09.187
[SPEAKER_06]: The super gay, gay, gay, gay, gay, gay song that's coming out very soon.

01:51:09.588 --> 01:51:13.890
[SPEAKER_06]: They showed a little preview of the video on Total Request Live, and somebody put it on the internet.

01:51:13.910 --> 01:51:14.471
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, get this.

01:51:15.191 --> 01:51:16.612
[SPEAKER_06]: Freaking DDRs in the video.

01:51:16.632 --> 01:51:20.633
[SPEAKER_06]: Should I show this in the little... I'll even post this link in the chat room.

01:51:21.593 --> 01:51:34.298
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to post the link to the little video clip that they have, and I'll play it in the studio, see what you guys think here about this clip of Hung Up, which actually, I guess it's not really DDR, but it's actually Dancing Stage Fusion, but, you know, DDR.

01:51:34.318 --> 01:51:34.918
[SPEAKER_06]: It's still DDR.

01:51:35.899 --> 01:51:37.039
[SPEAKER_06]: It's DDR under a different name.

01:51:37.319 --> 01:51:39.040
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, Madonna, she's got to be so British.

01:51:42.162 --> 01:51:42.743
[SPEAKER_06]: Madonna's New...

01:52:05.781 --> 01:52:10.306
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got a video, and I can't play it in Firefox.

01:52:10.426 --> 01:52:17.913
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to open up Internet Explorer because Firefox won't play that clip, but I want to play it for you guys in studio.

01:52:19.935 --> 01:52:20.596
[SPEAKER_06]: And here we go.

01:52:20.856 --> 01:52:23.018
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, that's posted in our chat room at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.

01:52:23.038 --> 01:52:25.861
[SPEAKER_06]: Click on chat, and here it is for us in studio.

01:52:47.049 --> 01:52:51.753
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so you can see, like, what was Madonna doing at the end of the clip there?

01:52:51.813 --> 01:52:55.156
[SPEAKER_06]: She's like doing that rolling in the dough thing on the DDR machine.

01:52:55.196 --> 01:52:59.720
[SPEAKER_06]: She's really getting down on that machine, and she's kind of surrounded by her dancers, so...

01:53:00.967 --> 01:53:03.970
[SPEAKER_06]: DDR is making it into the mainstream, that's for sure.

01:53:03.990 --> 01:53:04.951
[SPEAKER_15]: Madonna bugs me.

01:53:05.973 --> 01:53:06.593
[SPEAKER_15]: And you're gay!

01:53:06.834 --> 01:53:07.855
[SPEAKER_15]: I know, I can't stand it.

01:53:07.895 --> 01:53:12.600
[SPEAKER_15]: I've never really liked her, except for with the exception of her Oh Father video.

01:53:13.301 --> 01:53:17.766
[SPEAKER_15]: But, I don't know, just something about her, she's just pretentious.

01:53:17.826 --> 01:53:20.189
[SPEAKER_15]: So has DDR officially jumped the shark with this or something?

01:53:20.209 --> 01:53:20.349
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

01:53:21.649 --> 01:53:22.069
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

01:53:22.149 --> 01:53:23.850
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, I can't stand the song.

01:53:24.150 --> 01:53:26.171
[SPEAKER_15]: I think the song absolutely sucks.

01:53:26.811 --> 01:53:30.392
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what you said when I played it the other day.

01:53:30.752 --> 01:53:32.653
[SPEAKER_15]: I did not say that I liked that song.

01:53:32.813 --> 01:53:34.713
[SPEAKER_06]: He didn't say you liked it, but he said it wasn't that bad.

01:53:35.753 --> 01:53:37.694
[SPEAKER_15]: I didn't say anything about it, I don't think.

01:53:39.094 --> 01:53:40.635
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't even like the ABBA original.

01:53:41.875 --> 01:53:43.636
[SPEAKER_15]: Everybody hating me now because I just said that.

01:53:43.656 --> 01:53:43.916
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I don't.

01:53:44.456 --> 01:53:44.996
[SPEAKER_15]: It's fine.

01:53:46.957 --> 01:53:47.237
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

01:53:47.457 --> 01:53:48.537
[SPEAKER_06]: But DDR in the video?

01:53:49.098 --> 01:53:50.158
[SPEAKER_06]: Good thing or bad thing for DDR?

01:53:51.345 --> 01:53:52.586
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, that's cool and everything.

01:53:52.626 --> 01:53:54.347
[SPEAKER_15]: Madonna, obviously, is huge.

01:53:55.607 --> 01:54:01.491
[SPEAKER_15]: By her having the video game in her video, that's a big deal.

01:54:02.311 --> 01:54:04.873
[SPEAKER_15]: But, you know, just me, a personal thing, I don't like her.

01:54:05.853 --> 01:54:06.253
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

01:54:07.694 --> 01:54:10.436
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think, Loki, as a straight guy...

01:54:12.335 --> 01:54:18.439
[SPEAKER_06]: who, you know, as this Madonna doing an ABBA thing must be very, very, very gay.

01:54:18.779 --> 01:54:21.421
[SPEAKER_06]: And now to see DDR in the video makes it gay-y gay.

01:54:22.181 --> 01:54:22.662
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think?

01:54:23.282 --> 01:54:35.230
[SPEAKER_06]: I think she's just trying to, you know, throw as much pop culture references in there, you know, to... She's insane, just like, you know, frickin' Tom Cruise, okay?

01:54:35.490 --> 01:54:38.512
[SPEAKER_06]: They're all lumped together, frickin' crazy-ass people.

01:54:38.905 --> 01:54:39.445
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

01:54:39.746 --> 01:54:44.309
[SPEAKER_06]: The last thing I'd be doing once I got lots of money would be going insane.

01:54:46.210 --> 01:54:48.371
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, hmm, I have lots of money to buy stuff.

01:54:48.451 --> 01:54:50.072
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I think I'll go insane instead.

01:54:50.212 --> 01:54:51.353
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's just denounce everything.

01:54:51.433 --> 01:54:53.635
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's be as whacked out crazy as possible.

01:54:53.655 --> 01:54:57.837
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's become Jewish, and then Catholic, and then Jewish, and then Catholic, and then Jewish, and then Catholic.

01:54:58.318 --> 01:54:59.078
[SPEAKER_15]: And then Kambala.

01:55:00.139 --> 01:55:00.959
[SPEAKER_15]: And Scientologist.

01:55:01.840 --> 01:55:04.442
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so, you know, Esther can go fuck my ass.

01:55:06.083 --> 01:55:06.823
[SPEAKER_06]: Stupid Esther.

01:55:07.544 --> 01:55:07.804
[SPEAKER_06]: Esther!

01:55:08.671 --> 01:55:09.692
[SPEAKER_06]: I like Madonna.

01:55:09.792 --> 01:55:12.493
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't like Ugo over Madonna, but, you know, she's cool.

01:55:12.573 --> 01:55:13.553
[SPEAKER_06]: I respect what she's doing.

01:55:13.713 --> 01:55:15.194
[SPEAKER_06]: No, you mean Esther.

01:55:15.214 --> 01:55:20.716
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you've got to respect Madonna's freestyle, though, in the video, because she's looking away from the screen.

01:55:21.136 --> 01:55:22.317
[SPEAKER_06]: So I give her points for that.

01:55:22.357 --> 01:55:27.319
[SPEAKER_06]: And somebody in the chatroom says, OMG, Madonna is AAA-ing Paranoia, Survivor, Max, Oni, S4R.

01:55:29.400 --> 01:55:30.120
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys are nerds.

01:55:30.320 --> 01:55:32.021
[SPEAKER_06]: And making a music video at the same time.

01:55:32.421 --> 01:55:35.542
[SPEAKER_06]: Angel, DDR in a Madonna video.

01:55:35.842 --> 01:55:37.223
[SPEAKER_06]: Good for DDR or bad news?

01:55:40.963 --> 01:55:41.823
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't know.

01:55:42.343 --> 01:55:45.404
[SPEAKER_26]: I guess it's okay, but it's Madonna.

01:55:48.986 --> 01:55:49.226
[SPEAKER_26]: No.

01:55:52.927 --> 01:55:55.008
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody heard that.

01:55:55.128 --> 01:55:58.470
[SPEAKER_15]: I just said she should have done Like A Virgin.

01:55:58.510 --> 01:56:04.692
[SPEAKER_15]: If she's going to do a DDR video, she should have done a live version of her Like A Virgin where she humped the stage.

01:56:05.412 --> 01:56:06.573
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, the dancing stage.

01:56:08.760 --> 01:56:14.764
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, and on that note, Sky... Loki, do you have anything else going on in the DDR world you want to share?

01:56:15.004 --> 01:56:17.506
[SPEAKER_06]: Didn't the new website open up or something, speaking of gay?

01:56:20.808 --> 01:56:30.735
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, the Ultramix 3 website was launched, and they changed the freaking logo on us to something that's super-duper gaytastic.

01:56:31.135 --> 01:56:32.236
[SPEAKER_06]: So what's the logo look like now?

01:56:32.696 --> 01:56:37.239
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, let me just pull it up for you, since that's what I do nowadays.

01:56:40.655 --> 01:56:43.456
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, what I'll do... It's really bad.

01:56:43.656 --> 01:56:49.237
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically, it's kind of this party theme with a giant friggin' rainbow going through it.

01:56:50.458 --> 01:56:54.779
[SPEAKER_06]: So, um... Yeah, basically... Here it is, right here.

01:56:55.039 --> 01:56:55.299
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

01:56:57.220 --> 01:56:57.680
[SPEAKER_06]: Be afraid.

01:56:59.060 --> 01:57:02.441
[SPEAKER_06]: It's giant rainbow-ass revolution... It's rainbow-tastic.

01:57:02.461 --> 01:57:05.422
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, Emmy's got her outfit from the graduation video.

01:57:05.762 --> 01:57:08.303
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll make a lot of fanboys happy because that skirt is very short.

01:57:08.814 --> 01:57:10.416
[SPEAKER_06]: Slut Emmy would have been better.

01:57:10.796 --> 01:57:12.397
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyways, there it is.

01:57:12.678 --> 01:57:17.202
[SPEAKER_06]: Ultramix 3 with its stupid rainbow-tastic stuff.

01:57:18.463 --> 01:57:18.684
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

01:57:20.025 --> 01:57:20.465
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

01:57:22.727 --> 01:57:23.809
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was really lame.

01:57:24.009 --> 01:57:33.318
[SPEAKER_06]: But they did have, there's some screenshots on there which, you know, sort of, you know, that's where we got all the, you know, new songs that were coming out and stuff.

01:57:34.011 --> 01:57:35.532
[SPEAKER_06]: Hung up by Madonna to match the theme, you think?

01:57:35.552 --> 01:57:38.513
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe a secret license in Ultramix 3?

01:57:38.553 --> 01:57:40.974
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know about that, but...

01:58:03.826 --> 01:58:08.369
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let's get into the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match tonight, shall we boys and girls?

01:58:08.930 --> 01:58:09.730
[SPEAKER_06]: It is about that time.

01:58:12.132 --> 01:58:15.274
[SPEAKER_06]: The way the Cage Match works, as a reminder, we're going to play three songs for you guys.

01:58:15.314 --> 01:58:18.857
[SPEAKER_06]: You kids get to vote for your favorite song, but you have to be in the chat room to vote.

01:58:19.697 --> 01:58:21.679
[SPEAKER_06]: You do, or else you're going to lose.

01:58:22.952 --> 01:58:25.134
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, so we're going to do the chat room tonight.

01:58:25.174 --> 01:58:27.196
[SPEAKER_06]: Three songs in the cage match.

01:58:27.236 --> 01:58:31.800
[SPEAKER_06]: You only get to hear a clip of last week's winner, though, because you already heard it last week.

01:58:31.840 --> 01:58:35.002
[SPEAKER_06]: And it actually won two weeks in a row now, so it's going for its third win.

01:58:35.463 --> 01:58:39.526
[SPEAKER_06]: The group is called Pendulum, and the song is called Hold Your Color.

01:58:39.907 --> 01:58:42.209
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's song number one you can vote for in tonight's cage match.

01:58:42.249 --> 01:58:42.729
[SPEAKER_06]: So get ready.

01:58:42.769 --> 01:58:45.872
[SPEAKER_06]: Here comes the clip of song number one, Pendulum with Hold Your Color.

01:58:52.749 --> 01:58:54.611
When they take everything away

02:01:22.393 --> 02:01:24.235
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, that was song number one.

02:01:25.416 --> 02:01:27.998
[SPEAKER_06]: Last week's winner, Pendulum with Hold Your Color.

02:01:28.539 --> 02:01:34.464
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, we're going to get into song number two tonight, and song number two comes to us courtesy of Loki.

02:01:35.045 --> 02:01:36.666
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, what did you pick for us tonight?

02:01:37.927 --> 02:01:42.792
[SPEAKER_06]: I picked, as I promised last week, I picked Pendulum again.

02:01:46.104 --> 02:01:47.646
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no rules about this.

02:01:48.247 --> 02:01:50.269
[SPEAKER_06]: This is Slam by Pendulum.

02:01:50.409 --> 02:01:53.793
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to edit in the intro, but then I realized that the song would be too long.

02:01:54.333 --> 02:02:00.200
[SPEAKER_06]: As a reminder, last week, Loki was pissed that Pendulum won, so he decided to put another Pendulum song in.

02:02:00.660 --> 02:02:02.983
[SPEAKER_06]: It lost, so he's doing it again.

02:02:05.045 --> 02:02:05.206
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

02:02:06.397 --> 02:02:07.138
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to make a rule.

02:02:07.158 --> 02:02:07.818
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to make a rule.

02:02:07.838 --> 02:02:10.080
[SPEAKER_06]: Jamie and I are going to get together and make a rule and outvote your ass.

02:02:10.240 --> 02:02:12.802
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, no more Pendulum and Cage Match ever or something.

02:02:12.822 --> 02:02:14.683
[SPEAKER_06]: And then Shane will be mad at you because it'll be your fault.

02:02:14.703 --> 02:02:15.864
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not going to be my fault.

02:02:15.904 --> 02:02:16.625
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be your fault.

02:02:17.445 --> 02:02:17.885
[SPEAKER_06]: That's fine.

02:02:17.926 --> 02:02:19.847
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll just put other... I'll put girls in again.

02:02:19.987 --> 02:02:20.547
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, shit.

02:02:20.607 --> 02:02:20.988
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

02:02:22.409 --> 02:02:22.869
[SPEAKER_06]: Here it is.

02:02:22.969 --> 02:02:24.610
[SPEAKER_06]: Song number two in tonight's Cage Match.

02:02:24.690 --> 02:02:26.412
[SPEAKER_06]: Pendulum with Slam.

02:03:24.956 --> 02:03:25.860
[SPEAKER_01]: on this small place.

02:05:50.734 --> 02:05:59.345
[SPEAKER_01]: were marooned on a small island in an endless sea, confined to a tiny spit of sand, unable to escape.

02:05:59.365 --> 02:06:01.628
[SPEAKER_01]: But tonight, it's heavy stuff, heavy stuff.

02:08:13.471 --> 02:08:16.554
[SPEAKER_06]: Song number two in tonight's cage match, Pendulum with Slam.

02:08:16.614 --> 02:08:20.897
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see, was that song slammin' or do you want to slam that song into the ground?

02:08:20.977 --> 02:08:27.122
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, give it a ten, because if you drive with that song really loud on your radio, it has a lot of bass in it.

02:08:27.162 --> 02:08:27.543
[SPEAKER_06]: It's cool.

02:08:28.904 --> 02:08:29.104
[SPEAKER_06]: Angel.

02:08:31.616 --> 02:08:35.298
[SPEAKER_26]: Um, that makes me wanna, like, go kill a lion now or something.

02:08:35.358 --> 02:08:39.881
[SPEAKER_26]: Sorry to those that play Alliance, but, um... God, this thing doesn't sound like it's on.

02:08:40.021 --> 02:08:40.402
[SPEAKER_26]: Huh!

02:08:41.062 --> 02:08:41.382
[SPEAKER_26]: It's on.

02:08:41.542 --> 02:08:41.823
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay.

02:08:42.023 --> 02:08:45.565
[SPEAKER_26]: Um... Oh, hell.

02:08:46.265 --> 02:08:46.686
[SPEAKER_26]: Seven.

02:08:49.407 --> 02:08:50.008
[SPEAKER_06]: I got bored.

02:08:50.208 --> 02:08:50.528
[SPEAKER_06]: Three.

02:08:51.269 --> 02:08:51.669
[SPEAKER_06]: Extra room.

02:08:53.496 --> 02:09:02.405
[SPEAKER_15]: I kind of got bored too, but Loki did make a good point that this would be a good song to blast out your Harvard.

02:09:02.766 --> 02:09:04.788
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, if you want to put the other people on the road to sleep.

02:09:06.410 --> 02:09:08.752
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, you don't knock it until you've tried it.

02:09:09.413 --> 02:09:09.773
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

02:09:09.994 --> 02:09:12.136
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, so I give it an 8 for that.

02:09:12.697 --> 02:09:12.997
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

02:09:14.537 --> 02:09:16.517
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember, it's not our thoughts that count.

02:09:16.598 --> 02:09:17.298
[SPEAKER_06]: It's yours.

02:09:17.398 --> 02:09:18.378
[SPEAKER_06]: You have the final say.

02:09:18.418 --> 02:09:20.238
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's song number three in tonight's cage match.

02:09:20.378 --> 02:09:26.700
[SPEAKER_06]: Even though the lovely DarkSakura is not here tonight, she was kind enough to provide this song for you guys.

02:09:26.800 --> 02:09:28.440
[SPEAKER_06]: It's song number three, her song tonight.

02:09:28.920 --> 02:09:31.401
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an artist that was in DDR USA.

02:09:32.801 --> 02:09:34.522
[SPEAKER_06]: I shouldn't say DDR USA.

02:09:34.542 --> 02:09:36.482
[SPEAKER_06]: I should say DDR Extreme USA.

02:09:37.062 --> 02:09:38.003
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Junior Senior.

02:09:38.523 --> 02:09:38.883
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember them?

02:09:38.903 --> 02:09:39.683
[SPEAKER_06]: They did Move Your Feet.

02:09:40.563 --> 02:09:41.704
[SPEAKER_06]: This is another song by them.

02:09:41.764 --> 02:09:43.344
[SPEAKER_06]: It's called Shake Your Coconuts.

02:09:44.721 --> 02:09:46.603
[SPEAKER_06]: So get ready to shake your coconuts to this song.

02:09:46.643 --> 02:09:48.125
[SPEAKER_06]: It's song number three in tonight's skating match.

02:09:48.205 --> 02:09:48.446
[SPEAKER_06]: Enjoy.

02:11:03.851 --> 02:11:04.900
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

02:11:54.286 --> 02:11:55.268
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for watching!

02:12:19.016 --> 02:12:23.038
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, song number three in tonight's cage match, Junior Senior with Shake Your Coconuts.

02:12:23.098 --> 02:12:24.439
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you shake your coconuts?

02:12:25.179 --> 02:12:26.620
[SPEAKER_06]: Or was that song just nuts?

02:12:26.720 --> 02:12:27.060
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

02:12:27.120 --> 02:12:27.481
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki.

02:12:28.541 --> 02:12:29.182
[SPEAKER_06]: Get Loki a mic.

02:12:30.342 --> 02:12:31.043
[SPEAKER_06]: That was lame.

02:12:31.063 --> 02:12:32.763
[SPEAKER_06]: That was really lame.

02:12:33.604 --> 02:12:34.724
[SPEAKER_06]: That was awful lame.

02:12:35.305 --> 02:12:36.145
[SPEAKER_06]: It gives a four.

02:12:37.106 --> 02:12:37.526
[SPEAKER_06]: Angel.

02:12:41.648 --> 02:12:42.269
[SPEAKER_26]: It was okay.

02:12:42.889 --> 02:12:47.051
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't mind that song, but, um, no.

02:12:47.952 --> 02:12:48.572
[SPEAKER_26]: Six and a half.

02:12:50.632 --> 02:12:51.273
[SPEAKER_15]: X-Deferred!

02:12:52.294 --> 02:12:56.317
[SPEAKER_15]: Forgive me for saying this, but I felt like busting a nut.

02:12:58.980 --> 02:13:01.042
[SPEAKER_28]: God damn it, I hate you!

02:13:01.723 --> 02:13:04.966
[SPEAKER_15]: They said shake your coconut till the nut comes out or something like that.

02:13:05.046 --> 02:13:05.666
[SPEAKER_15]: I think so, yes.

02:13:06.087 --> 02:13:07.648
[SPEAKER_15]: That's pretty foul.

02:13:08.008 --> 02:13:09.610
[SPEAKER_15]: I give it, like I said, for that.

02:13:10.478 --> 02:13:14.519
[SPEAKER_15]: So vote for song 2 because we don't want song 1 to win.

02:13:14.659 --> 02:13:16.719
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I'm behind Loki's whole scheme here.

02:13:16.839 --> 02:13:17.240
[SPEAKER_06]: Shut up.

02:13:18.900 --> 02:13:21.040
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought that song was awesome, you know why?

02:13:21.180 --> 02:13:22.721
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it wasn't Pendulum.

02:13:23.261 --> 02:13:27.502
[SPEAKER_06]: So therefore it gets an 8 automatically because it was awesome for not being Pendulum.

02:13:27.622 --> 02:13:30.062
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think 8 really translates to awesome, Rob.

02:13:30.242 --> 02:13:31.083
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not orgasmic.

02:13:32.043 --> 02:13:33.583
[SPEAKER_15]: No, no, no, I don't think it really does.

02:13:33.603 --> 02:13:34.663
[SPEAKER_06]: 8 is, you know what, shut up.

02:13:35.264 --> 02:13:35.804
[SPEAKER_06]: Orgasmic would be 11.

02:13:35.844 --> 02:13:36.144
[SPEAKER_06]: Shut up.

02:13:39.383 --> 02:13:42.145
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's recap the songs you can vote for in tonight's cage match.

02:13:42.625 --> 02:13:46.748
[SPEAKER_06]: Song number one is Pendulum with Hold Your Color.

02:13:46.848 --> 02:13:47.769
[SPEAKER_06]: It's last week's winner.

02:13:56.014 --> 02:13:59.637
[SPEAKER_06]: And song number two you can vote for in tonight's cage match is Slam.

02:14:11.497 --> 02:14:15.419
[SPEAKER_06]: And song number three you can vote for tonight is Junior Senior with Shake Your Coconuts.

02:14:25.083 --> 02:14:27.324
[SPEAKER_06]: Place vote now.

02:14:27.404 --> 02:14:30.245
[SPEAKER_06]: Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.

02:14:31.035 --> 02:14:32.076
[SPEAKER_06]: and we'll let you know who won.

02:14:32.276 --> 02:14:33.497
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember, it's not up to us.

02:14:33.637 --> 02:14:36.239
[SPEAKER_06]: We're just big idiots.

02:14:36.259 --> 02:14:37.781
[SPEAKER_15]: We're like the American Idol judges.

02:14:37.801 --> 02:14:39.602
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, kind of, and it really isn't up to us.

02:14:40.823 --> 02:14:41.944
[SPEAKER_15]: You would be Paula Abdul.

02:14:42.565 --> 02:14:43.625
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not Paula Abdul.

02:14:43.745 --> 02:14:46.027
[SPEAKER_06]: You're totally the Paula Abdul.

02:14:46.468 --> 02:14:47.749
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm Randy Dog.

02:14:49.030 --> 02:14:49.991
[SPEAKER_15]: What up, Dog?

02:14:50.111 --> 02:14:51.092
[SPEAKER_15]: What up, Dog?

02:14:51.232 --> 02:14:54.594
[SPEAKER_15]: I can't stand that fucking show right now.

02:14:54.634 --> 02:14:56.036
[SPEAKER_11]: You watch it every year!

02:14:56.476 --> 02:14:59.719
[SPEAKER_15]: I know, and the thing is, it's just like TV crack.

02:15:00.455 --> 02:15:07.162
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, it's like you have to watch something that's kind of a guilty pleasure that you can't stand, but you watch it anyway.

02:15:07.182 --> 02:15:09.684
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of like Jerry Springer.

02:15:10.365 --> 02:15:11.686
[SPEAKER_06]: Ringmaster was on TV today.

02:15:11.726 --> 02:15:13.088
[SPEAKER_06]: I had to watch it, or some of it.

02:15:13.889 --> 02:15:16.892
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I actually saw Ringmaster in the theater the day it opened.

02:15:17.633 --> 02:15:18.754
[SPEAKER_06]: Four people in the theater.

02:15:21.797 --> 02:15:23.879
[SPEAKER_06]: Me and my roommate at the time and some other schmoes.

02:15:24.915 --> 02:15:25.556
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:15:41.658 --> 02:15:44.802
[SPEAKER_15]: Day 2 is Send My Kids to Boot Camp

02:15:58.464 --> 02:16:00.485
[SPEAKER_06]: Day 3 is my baby fat.

02:16:02.626 --> 02:16:06.068
[SPEAKER_15]: Day 4 would be I know I'm fat but I'm gorgeous.

02:16:06.448 --> 02:16:14.793
[SPEAKER_15]: How many times have you accidentally found yourself channel surfing and the channel lands on Maury Povich and it's about their baby being fat?

02:16:16.233 --> 02:16:18.735
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, dude, stop feeding your kid!

02:16:20.616 --> 02:16:22.017
[SPEAKER_25]: Like, shit!

02:16:25.051 --> 02:16:26.372
[SPEAKER_25]: and we're supposed to feel sympathy.

02:16:26.412 --> 02:16:30.835
[SPEAKER_25]: The mom's like, fuck, bitch, talk to your kid.

02:16:34.237 --> 02:16:37.719
[SPEAKER_06]: I suppose we should get into the, do you have a movie review for us tonight, Extifer?

02:16:37.879 --> 02:16:38.379
[SPEAKER_06]: I forgot to ask.

02:16:38.459 --> 02:16:40.241
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, Extifer, I forgot to mention.

02:16:40.921 --> 02:16:43.022
[SPEAKER_06]: Our work, because, you know, I work at a video distributor.

02:16:43.783 --> 02:16:47.485
[SPEAKER_06]: Wednesday, we get, in our theater, we get to watch Serenity.

02:16:47.945 --> 02:16:49.166
[SPEAKER_06]: So, for free.

02:16:50.147 --> 02:16:50.527
[SPEAKER_06]: And we get pizza!

02:16:50.547 --> 02:16:51.287
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty damn awesome.

02:16:51.388 --> 02:16:52.588
[SPEAKER_06]: That is double awesome.

02:16:52.608 --> 02:16:53.589
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I hope you enjoy it.

02:16:54.011 --> 02:17:00.555
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, seeing Serenity for free is about the only way people are seeing it these days, apparently, because the movie's not making any money right now.

02:17:02.236 --> 02:17:04.457
[SPEAKER_15]: You, that is very funny to you, isn't it?

02:17:05.278 --> 02:17:07.579
[SPEAKER_15]: Sadistic bitch.

02:17:07.999 --> 02:17:16.885
[SPEAKER_15]: No, but, you know, I saw it for free, actually, you know, a few months, or a couple months ago, maybe, a month and a half, and it was really good free.

02:17:17.445 --> 02:17:19.566
[SPEAKER_15]: But it was also good when I paid money, so, you know.

02:17:20.747 --> 02:17:20.847
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

02:17:20.867 --> 02:17:20.947
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

02:17:22.383 --> 02:17:23.884
[SPEAKER_15]: Are you going to do a movie review for us tonight?

02:17:25.005 --> 02:17:27.067
[SPEAKER_15]: Sure, I'll think up a movie review.

02:17:27.147 --> 02:17:30.369
[SPEAKER_15]: I haven't seen really any movies this week, so I'll think up one.

02:17:30.809 --> 02:17:32.050
[SPEAKER_15]: Just don't play the gay music.

02:17:34.172 --> 02:17:35.433
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll get to your gay review later.

02:17:35.573 --> 02:17:38.034
[SPEAKER_06]: My fiance's been watching Desperate Housewives.

02:17:38.255 --> 02:17:38.915
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, God.

02:17:39.596 --> 02:17:41.397
[SPEAKER_06]: She's jumped on that bandwagon.

02:17:43.138 --> 02:17:44.059
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody pity me.

02:17:45.440 --> 02:17:46.941
[SPEAKER_06]: Next thing you know, it's going to be Lost, too.

02:17:48.815 --> 02:17:50.577
[SPEAKER_06]: Like this bitch watches every week.

02:17:50.677 --> 02:17:52.099
[SPEAKER_06]: We have the season one box set.

02:17:52.179 --> 02:17:55.603
[SPEAKER_06]: It's in my pile of stuff that's going to be returned to GameStop for games.

02:17:58.126 --> 02:18:00.489
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, we have Lost and she wants to watch that too.

02:18:00.509 --> 02:18:01.070
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, no.

02:18:03.906 --> 02:18:05.727
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to get to your sim update, Loki.

02:18:05.767 --> 02:18:07.968
[SPEAKER_06]: What's going on in the sim scene?

02:18:07.988 --> 02:18:11.809
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, okay, I actually do have the story now about that stupid button mash revolution thing.

02:18:13.030 --> 02:18:15.971
[SPEAKER_06]: Finally found it because, you know, PSP updates hide their shit.

02:18:16.331 --> 02:18:19.413
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways, it's this game called Button Mash Revolution Version 1.

02:18:19.973 --> 02:18:20.833
[SPEAKER_06]: It's for the PSP.

02:18:20.853 --> 02:18:23.634
[SPEAKER_06]: You can only run it if you have a version 1.5 firmware.

02:18:25.835 --> 02:18:28.618
[SPEAKER_06]: And basically, it's like DDR, except you use your buttons.

02:18:28.658 --> 02:18:29.539
[SPEAKER_06]: There are no arrows.

02:18:29.619 --> 02:18:32.541
[SPEAKER_06]: Instead, there are the four corresponding buttons that are on the PSP.

02:18:33.282 --> 02:18:35.984
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's music in it, and someone made it in Lua.

02:18:37.125 --> 02:18:42.090
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't really know what kind of music is in it, because I haven't downloaded it yet, but it looks kind of fun.

02:18:42.190 --> 02:18:48.175
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you're looking for something to waste some space on your memory card, check it out at PSPUpdates.com.

02:18:48.215 --> 02:18:49.456
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to have to actually...

02:18:50.270 --> 02:18:51.411
[SPEAKER_06]: Button Mash Revolution Version 1

02:19:04.827 --> 02:19:06.008
[SPEAKER_06]: DJ Max Portable

02:19:28.942 --> 02:19:32.404
[SPEAKER_06]: Just be really awesome to see some more music games coming to the PSP.

02:19:32.744 --> 02:19:39.387
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you want to check out the website, I believe it's DJMax.com, but I'm not positive.

02:19:40.408 --> 02:19:43.149
[SPEAKER_06]: Just search for DJ Max, and I'm sure you'll find it.

02:19:45.390 --> 02:19:49.172
[SPEAKER_06]: And other than that, really, I don't think there's too much else going on in the sim scene.

02:19:50.313 --> 02:19:56.456
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't been really paying attention to the sim scene because nothing really interesting has been going on for me.

02:19:57.301 --> 02:20:01.024
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, tournaments and stuff, just like, eh, don't care.

02:20:03.346 --> 02:20:06.729
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm glad you're a faithful reporter in the sim industry.

02:20:06.809 --> 02:20:08.831
[SPEAKER_06]: There's really nothing going on, honestly.

02:20:08.911 --> 02:20:13.455
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I'm sure if MySaw had their sim section up, there'd be more crappy remixes of Max.

02:20:14.076 --> 02:20:17.279
[SPEAKER_06]: But unfortunately, I can't report on that because there is no sim section anymore.

02:20:17.799 --> 02:20:22.043
[SPEAKER_06]: I do know of a new torrent site that came up that has some stuff on it, but...

02:20:23.991 --> 02:20:25.313
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's about it.

02:20:26.254 --> 02:20:29.838
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm more interested in checking out Ultramix 3 when that comes out in a couple weeks.

02:20:30.339 --> 02:20:34.585
[SPEAKER_06]: As well as all my 360 games coming at the same time.

02:20:34.605 --> 02:20:36.567
[SPEAKER_06]: I know I gotta save my money for the 360.

02:20:37.208 --> 02:20:40.272
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not looking forward to spending that kind of money, but what can you do?

02:20:40.589 --> 02:20:41.029
[SPEAKER_06]: That's okay.

02:20:41.510 --> 02:20:42.751
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to be getting my controllers.

02:20:42.791 --> 02:20:44.192
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got about four games lined up.

02:20:44.512 --> 02:20:47.694
[SPEAKER_06]: Just, you know, with all the store credit I've earned in the last few months.

02:20:48.215 --> 02:20:49.596
[SPEAKER_06]: And just fun stuff like that.

02:20:49.876 --> 02:20:56.441
[SPEAKER_06]: And hopefully, because now it's the first party, hopefully I can hit up some of our publishers and go, Hey, can you send me a free copy?

02:20:56.801 --> 02:20:57.202
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, come on.

02:20:58.363 --> 02:21:02.286
[SPEAKER_06]: Xbox Live, they're taking it down for a day to do some adjustments or something.

02:21:02.346 --> 02:21:06.349
[SPEAKER_06]: So are they going to have the Xbox 360 interface on the regular Xbox or something?

02:21:06.369 --> 02:21:06.709
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

02:21:07.489 --> 02:21:09.650
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they're taking down live because they're updating everything.

02:21:09.910 --> 02:21:17.913
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to actually have a website now where you can download all your stats and everything on live and people can actually view all that stuff, what games you're playing, what accomplishments you've done.

02:21:18.554 --> 02:21:25.116
[SPEAKER_06]: They've been announcing more stuff for the Xbox Live Arcade, the new one being Tetris is now on there because Tetris is on every system on the man.

02:21:25.236 --> 02:21:25.396
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

02:21:26.017 --> 02:21:26.157
[SPEAKER_06]: And...

02:21:27.290 --> 02:21:29.612
[SPEAKER_06]: Just lots of cool stuff they're doing for live.

02:21:30.052 --> 02:21:35.876
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm hoping that they're not using the same gamer tags, though, because I really want to get on there first and get Loki.

02:21:36.957 --> 02:21:38.838
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm wondering if they're going to carry the gamer tags over.

02:21:39.278 --> 02:21:40.539
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think so.

02:21:40.819 --> 02:21:41.660
[SPEAKER_06]: I wouldn't think so.

02:21:41.680 --> 02:21:43.041
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be interesting if they did.

02:21:43.121 --> 02:21:43.501
[SPEAKER_06]: They might.

02:21:43.541 --> 02:21:44.062
[SPEAKER_06]: Who knows?

02:21:44.122 --> 02:21:46.323
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they would have to for the backwards compatibility thing.

02:21:46.343 --> 02:21:47.044
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they'd have to.

02:21:47.444 --> 02:21:47.704
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe.

02:21:47.724 --> 02:21:48.244
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's okay.

02:21:48.284 --> 02:21:49.866
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a backup name just in case.

02:21:50.066 --> 02:21:50.426
[SPEAKER_06]: What's that?

02:21:51.292 --> 02:21:53.174
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't say, because someone's going to steal it.

02:21:53.715 --> 02:21:54.075
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.

02:21:54.896 --> 02:21:58.220
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not too far from, you know, the name I go by.

02:21:58.441 --> 02:21:58.781
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

02:21:59.522 --> 02:22:00.703
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, Super Loki?

02:22:01.344 --> 02:22:01.524
[SPEAKER_00]: Loki 6969?

02:22:01.564 --> 02:22:01.624
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

02:22:06.050 --> 02:22:06.350
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

02:22:06.931 --> 02:22:10.554
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't say my frickin' World of Warcraft name on air.

02:22:11.995 --> 02:22:13.957
[SPEAKER_06]: Or, um, well, you know, close enough.

02:22:13.977 --> 02:22:15.298
[SPEAKER_06]: He doesn't have a mic, it doesn't matter.

02:22:15.318 --> 02:22:16.960
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, this is a good thing.

02:22:18.521 --> 02:22:22.084
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, um, let's get to Extraverse Movie Review before we get to a break.

02:22:22.925 --> 02:22:23.706
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't have a movie yet?

02:22:23.866 --> 02:22:24.947
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, fine, then we'll have to go to a break.

02:22:26.547 --> 02:22:28.228
[SPEAKER_06]: To be continued.

02:27:00.104 --> 02:27:01.025
Thanks for watching!

02:27:43.130 --> 02:27:43.951
Thanks for watching!

02:28:11.212 --> 02:28:11.472
and more.

02:29:04.653 --> 02:29:07.781
Thanks for watching!

02:30:40.905 --> 02:30:41.866
[SPEAKER_05]: Gaming Radio.

02:30:42.106 --> 02:30:49.389
[SPEAKER_05]: So uncensored that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.

02:30:49.550 --> 02:30:50.890
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Lounge Radio.

02:30:51.551 --> 02:30:53.712
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi kids!

02:30:55.112 --> 02:30:55.693
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello.

02:30:55.913 --> 02:30:57.734
[SPEAKER_06]: We're back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:30:58.780 --> 02:31:01.261
[SPEAKER_06]: Just having ourselves a good old time on this Sunday evening.

02:31:01.461 --> 02:31:03.962
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for deciding to tune in and listen to us.

02:31:04.082 --> 02:31:04.883
[SPEAKER_06]: We appreciate it.

02:31:05.803 --> 02:31:06.984
[SPEAKER_06]: Although I'm kind of tired today.

02:31:07.024 --> 02:31:09.885
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just like, kind of sluggish.

02:31:09.905 --> 02:31:11.366
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, it's a lazy Sunday.

02:31:11.386 --> 02:31:14.247
[SPEAKER_15]: Of course, we were up like totally late last night.

02:31:14.307 --> 02:31:19.650
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've been doing a little drinking, so maybe I have a little bit of a hangover.

02:31:19.890 --> 02:31:20.910
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe a little bit.

02:31:21.291 --> 02:31:22.051
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a little bit.

02:31:23.792 --> 02:31:24.112
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

02:31:25.662 --> 02:31:30.405
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I guess now is the part of the show where I'm not going to do extra first movie review.

02:31:30.785 --> 02:31:30.945
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh.

02:31:31.565 --> 02:31:33.546
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I want to tell you guys who won tonight's cage match.

02:31:34.647 --> 02:31:34.967
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

02:31:35.267 --> 02:31:36.748
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is certainly something we need to hear about.

02:31:37.528 --> 02:31:41.591
[SPEAKER_06]: So the winner of tonight's cage match, it was one vote deciding things tonight, you guys.

02:31:41.611 --> 02:31:43.812
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a very, very close cage match.

02:31:44.492 --> 02:31:46.413
[SPEAKER_06]: Except for song number two, which got like no votes.

02:31:48.454 --> 02:31:51.916
[SPEAKER_06]: But the winning song by one vote in tonight's cage match is...

02:31:54.226 --> 02:32:00.989
[SPEAKER_06]: The Pendulum, Hold Your Color, for the third week in a row.

02:32:01.109 --> 02:32:03.730
[SPEAKER_06]: Next week, it goes for retirement.

02:32:03.830 --> 02:32:06.411
[SPEAKER_06]: If it is the winner next week, it will be retired.

02:32:06.771 --> 02:32:09.352
[SPEAKER_06]: It will be the first song to be retired in quite a while.

02:32:09.632 --> 02:32:17.395
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we had a song get retired by default, but I don't even remember because we missed two shows, and so it kind of held over for four weeks.

02:32:17.435 --> 02:32:18.036
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to say it was...

02:32:19.591 --> 02:32:22.193
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

02:32:47.159 --> 02:32:47.619
[SPEAKER_15]: No!

02:32:47.920 --> 02:32:51.663
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, I spoke out of... I didn't mean to say that.

02:32:53.604 --> 02:32:54.605
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm starting to review.

02:32:54.625 --> 02:32:55.506
[SPEAKER_15]: You can't play the song now.

02:32:55.666 --> 02:32:56.507
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, well... Oh, look.

02:32:56.767 --> 02:32:57.528
[SPEAKER_15]: You can't play it.

02:32:57.948 --> 02:32:59.589
[SPEAKER_15]: What are you going to be reviewing?

02:32:59.990 --> 02:33:02.292
[SPEAKER_15]: The movie I'm reviewing this week is Sphere.

02:33:03.272 --> 02:33:06.715
[SPEAKER_15]: Remember that movie, Terror Can Fill Any Space?

02:33:07.456 --> 02:33:07.636
[SPEAKER_29]: No.

02:33:08.216 --> 02:33:08.337
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh.

02:33:08.757 --> 02:33:12.360
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, that's what it says on the box art of Sphere.

02:33:13.337 --> 02:33:19.404
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's from the best-selling author of Jurassic Park and The Lost World, otherwise known as Michael Crichton.

02:33:21.306 --> 02:33:22.907
[SPEAKER_15]: Little info on some critics here.

02:33:23.087 --> 02:33:28.213
[SPEAKER_15]: Janet Maslin from the New York Times called it rich in techno terror.

02:33:29.215 --> 02:33:32.118
[SPEAKER_15]: A Solid Thriller Directed with Sustained Tension

02:33:45.831 --> 02:34:01.438
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyways, so I think Sphere was okay, I mean it wasn't great, but if you want to see Queen Latifah get killed by jellyfish, then I guess that would be the movie to watch, like her getting killed by jellyfish.

02:34:02.839 --> 02:34:04.140
[SPEAKER_15]: Rob, do you have anything to add to that?

02:34:06.421 --> 02:34:08.522
[SPEAKER_06]: From getting eaten by jellyfish to Pizza Hut commercials.

02:34:09.096 --> 02:34:20.704
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, basically the movie, the premise of the movie is that everybody's fears manifest themselves and they're down under, like deep, deep, deep into the ocean or water or whatever.

02:34:21.584 --> 02:34:26.688
[SPEAKER_15]: And basically, like, people get killed by their own fears, basically.

02:34:27.108 --> 02:34:29.390
[SPEAKER_15]: And Queen Latifah... Hey, Hector, can you hold on a minute?

02:34:33.512 --> 02:34:34.793
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry, I'm rocking out a little bit.

02:34:35.714 --> 02:34:36.454
[SPEAKER_15]: Of course you are.

02:34:37.415 --> 02:34:38.135
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, sorry, go ahead.

02:34:39.594 --> 02:34:45.216
[SPEAKER_15]: So, I'm sorry, I just got, I got stupid just then, because you played that song.

02:34:45.717 --> 02:35:00.403
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, no, the, so the movie basically is, it's really average, um, you know, I would give it a thumb sideways, um, because, you know, I'd give it an apathetic thumb anywhere, because I don't really care.

02:35:01.204 --> 02:35:05.707
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, and, um, you know, again, Queen Latifah died from jellyfish in it.

02:35:06.288 --> 02:35:09.330
[SPEAKER_15]: Again, I'd like to reiterate, she died from jellyfish.

02:35:09.350 --> 02:35:10.691
[SPEAKER_15]: She was like, oh my god!

02:35:11.771 --> 02:35:13.873
[SPEAKER_15]: I got killed by some damn jellyfish!

02:35:15.954 --> 02:35:22.339
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh my god, I gotta do Pizza Hut commercials, and I have to do Bringin' Down the House with Steve Martin in a few years.

02:35:22.399 --> 02:35:24.320
[SPEAKER_25]: I can't die from some damn jellyfish?

02:35:25.261 --> 02:35:26.221
[SPEAKER_06]: And don't forget Chicago.

02:35:27.082 --> 02:35:27.862
[SPEAKER_25]: Chicago, too!

02:35:28.303 --> 02:35:30.184
[SPEAKER_06]: When you're good to mama, mama's good to you, remember?

02:35:30.546 --> 02:35:31.067
[SPEAKER_15]: That's right.

02:35:32.027 --> 02:35:36.131
[SPEAKER_15]: She said, damn, god damn jellyfish.

02:35:36.171 --> 02:35:38.273
[SPEAKER_15]: No, the jellyfish, that was really funny.

02:35:38.314 --> 02:35:40.295
[SPEAKER_15]: And she acts really scared in it.

02:35:40.376 --> 02:35:40.756
[SPEAKER_15]: It's great.

02:35:41.701 --> 02:35:42.842
[SPEAKER_15]: That's the best scene in the movie.

02:35:43.342 --> 02:35:44.663
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, Queen Latifah getting eaten by jellyfish?

02:35:44.683 --> 02:35:46.004
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, being eaten by jellyfish.

02:35:46.244 --> 02:35:47.085
[SPEAKER_06]: Or being killed by jellyfish.

02:35:47.125 --> 02:35:50.867
[SPEAKER_06]: So, Spear gets this apathetic thumb, but Queen Latifah getting eaten by jellyfish is the thumbs up.

02:35:50.887 --> 02:35:52.408
[SPEAKER_06]: That is really the high point of the movie.

02:35:52.428 --> 02:35:56.431
[SPEAKER_15]: It's really kind of at the beginning, so I would recommend that part.

02:35:56.511 --> 02:36:00.074
[SPEAKER_15]: So, I'm glad you listened to my little, you know, segment here.

02:36:00.334 --> 02:36:01.234
[SPEAKER_15]: It was so interesting.

02:36:03.656 --> 02:36:04.376
[SPEAKER_06]: Listen tomorrow.

02:36:04.416 --> 02:36:04.857
[SPEAKER_06]: It's my new show.

02:36:04.877 --> 02:36:05.337
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm rocking out.

02:36:05.998 --> 02:36:07.599
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm rocking out to your gay ABBA.

02:36:08.799 --> 02:36:09.640
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not my gay ABBA.

02:36:09.660 --> 02:36:10.561
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, your gay ABBA.

02:36:10.901 --> 02:36:11.101
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not.

02:36:14.850 --> 02:36:19.493
[SPEAKER_15]: I still say there should be a machine called the ABBA, like an AB machine.

02:36:19.974 --> 02:36:23.956
[SPEAKER_15]: Every single time you crunch, it'll play a little bit of Dancing Queen or something.

02:36:25.117 --> 02:36:25.437
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

02:36:26.078 --> 02:36:31.081
[SPEAKER_15]: Or it'll go, like as you crunch it.

02:36:31.101 --> 02:36:36.325
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's about time that we get into the Orange Launch Radio Cage Match.

02:36:36.665 --> 02:36:38.646
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we're starting to get into that portion of the show.

02:36:39.387 --> 02:36:41.368
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure some of you guys are starting to get a little angsty.

02:36:41.649 --> 02:36:42.149
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys, this is...

02:36:44.059 --> 02:36:45.160
[SPEAKER_06]: Did I say the cage match?

02:36:45.180 --> 02:36:46.741
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, the FU's of the week.

02:36:48.563 --> 02:36:49.383
[SPEAKER_06]: It's one of those nights.

02:36:49.463 --> 02:36:50.464
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't give a fuck tonight.

02:36:50.524 --> 02:36:51.044
[SPEAKER_06]: I really don't.

02:36:53.366 --> 02:36:53.747
[SPEAKER_06]: That's alright.

02:36:53.767 --> 02:36:55.808
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to get into the FU's of the week because we're angsty.

02:36:56.068 --> 02:36:57.590
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe we're angsty because of cage match.

02:36:57.630 --> 02:36:57.950
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

02:36:58.590 --> 02:37:06.917
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway, DarkSakura isn't here tonight, but usually this is the part of the show where I would say, DarkSakura, why is it we do the FU's of the week every single week?

02:37:07.017 --> 02:37:08.058
[SPEAKER_06]: And then what would she say?

02:37:08.118 --> 02:37:10.580
[SPEAKER_06]: Something like, because we're angsty?

02:37:10.660 --> 02:37:12.041
[SPEAKER_06]: No, she says, ger arg, right?

02:37:22.827 --> 02:37:27.350
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura did leave a little message for me on AOL because she was a little bit angsty.

02:37:27.410 --> 02:37:31.093
[SPEAKER_06]: She said, had the most retarded field trip for school today.

02:37:31.173 --> 02:37:32.134
[SPEAKER_06]: That's my FU.

02:37:32.514 --> 02:37:33.835
[SPEAKER_06]: Retarded field trips.

02:37:34.796 --> 02:37:36.738
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't know you got to go on field trips in college.

02:37:36.798 --> 02:37:37.738
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe I should have finished.

02:37:41.241 --> 02:37:42.422
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, what's your FUs of the week?

02:37:46.074 --> 02:37:52.040
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, my first FU goes to, um, stupid drivers out there, because you're driving too damn slow, and getting in my way.

02:37:52.541 --> 02:38:06.996
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, my other FU goes to my apartment complex for deciding to repave the entire, um, parking lot, and basically rearrange some of the parking spaces and putting in some brand new handicapped ones, because the handicapped people have, like, all these 15 spaces that they can park in,

02:38:07.452 --> 02:38:24.871
[SPEAKER_06]: for all the two handicapped people in our complex and they have they put them in some really stupid spots like this one that's in this one spot where the actual ramp to where the handicapped people can go up is like way far away from it and also the fact that there's a giant curb in its way so it's kind of pointless to have a ramp there anyways

02:38:25.592 --> 02:38:27.514
[SPEAKER_06]: So, my apartment complex is retarded.

02:38:27.814 --> 02:38:32.319
[SPEAKER_06]: And also, fuck you, these stupid kids that keep throwing this tennis ball against the dumpster and playing Butts Up.

02:38:34.061 --> 02:38:35.382
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, I remember Butts Up.

02:38:35.422 --> 02:38:36.203
[SPEAKER_06]: That game was awesome.

02:38:36.223 --> 02:38:42.910
[SPEAKER_06]: These kids need to go someplace, so I stole their tennis ball, and it's in my house now, but they bought another one, so I have to steal that one, too.

02:38:42.930 --> 02:38:43.331
[SPEAKER_06]: You see this?

02:38:43.571 --> 02:38:44.332
[SPEAKER_06]: This is mine now.

02:38:44.712 --> 02:38:45.373
[SPEAKER_06]: This is mine now.

02:38:46.534 --> 02:38:47.135
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

02:38:48.016 --> 02:38:48.376
[SPEAKER_06]: Freaking...

02:38:48.916 --> 02:38:49.516
[SPEAKER_06]: Stupid people.

02:38:49.716 --> 02:38:50.097
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate them.

02:38:50.537 --> 02:39:05.104
[SPEAKER_06]: And also, uh, fuck you, the stupid woman that basically, uh, got all pissed off for Nelly having taken out her, um, laundry that had been sitting in one of the washers just unattended because it was already down to its cycle and she's all, WHERE MY CLOTHES AT?

02:39:07.185 --> 02:39:08.606
[SPEAKER_06]: And she's like, well, they're in the basket.

02:39:09.366 --> 02:39:11.327
[SPEAKER_06]: BETTER NOT BE STEALING MY CLOTHES!

02:39:13.299 --> 02:39:16.601
[SPEAKER_06]: And she had her freaking shower cap on and stuff.

02:39:16.841 --> 02:39:18.722
[SPEAKER_06]: Total ghetto woman.

02:39:18.802 --> 02:39:20.603
[SPEAKER_06]: You should have threatened them with some jellyfish.

02:39:21.704 --> 02:39:22.884
[SPEAKER_06]: Where my clothes at?

02:39:22.904 --> 02:39:24.765
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

02:39:24.845 --> 02:39:25.646
[SPEAKER_06]: I can tell you this much.

02:39:25.726 --> 02:39:29.688
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd be handling the situation differently if I was in there.

02:39:30.708 --> 02:39:31.989
[SPEAKER_06]: She'd be like, where my clothes at?

02:39:32.009 --> 02:39:34.130
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'd be like, talking English, bitch.

02:39:35.991 --> 02:39:36.551
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah.

02:39:37.411 --> 02:39:38.472
[SPEAKER_06]: That's my abuse of the week.

02:39:46.616 --> 02:39:48.037
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm relatively angst-free.

02:39:48.417 --> 02:39:53.799
[SPEAKER_06]: I got most of my angst out in my live journal earlier this week, because that's what live journals are for, is for memes.

02:39:54.159 --> 02:39:56.320
[SPEAKER_06]: I know they're called memes or whatever, but I call them memes.

02:39:57.320 --> 02:40:00.921
[SPEAKER_06]: Live journals for memes and me venting once in a while.

02:40:00.961 --> 02:40:03.482
[SPEAKER_06]: So I've actually got most of it out of my system, so I feel pretty good.

02:40:04.663 --> 02:40:14.026
[SPEAKER_06]: But just an F you to, like, three days this week I ended up staying at work, like, way later than I was originally intending to, and I don't like that.

02:40:15.347 --> 02:40:15.447
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

02:40:16.863 --> 02:40:20.784
[SPEAKER_06]: An FU to dumbasses in World of Warcraft, because there's been a couple that kind of pissed me off.

02:40:20.804 --> 02:40:24.486
[SPEAKER_06]: An FU to the fact that I haven't gotten onto other servers yet, but I swear I'm going to at some point.

02:40:26.446 --> 02:40:31.388
[SPEAKER_06]: And an FU to me having to save money for an Xbox 360, because I don't like being poor.

02:40:31.948 --> 02:40:32.528
[SPEAKER_06]: Being poor sucks.

02:40:33.929 --> 02:40:35.329
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.

02:40:35.369 --> 02:40:37.610
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's get to Angel and Angel's FUs of the week.

02:40:41.158 --> 02:40:42.139
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, let's see.

02:40:43.159 --> 02:40:45.680
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm still kind of pretty pissed off at my computer even though it works now.

02:40:46.000 --> 02:40:46.780
[SPEAKER_26]: So, F you to that.

02:40:47.140 --> 02:40:52.302
[SPEAKER_26]: Because if it hadn't broken down, I would be level 40 by now.

02:40:52.502 --> 02:40:55.163
[SPEAKER_26]: Because, um, yeah.

02:40:55.243 --> 02:40:57.124
[SPEAKER_26]: Damn level requirements for guilds.

02:40:57.204 --> 02:40:57.704
[SPEAKER_26]: Jesus.

02:40:59.385 --> 02:41:01.926
[SPEAKER_26]: Speaking of which, I have to hit level 50 by next Tuesday.

02:41:01.966 --> 02:41:04.867
[SPEAKER_26]: So, F you to that too because I don't even know if I'm going to make it.

02:41:06.107 --> 02:41:08.808
[SPEAKER_26]: Um, other than that...

02:41:10.547 --> 02:41:13.128
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, yeah, I've been to go to school four days a week now.

02:41:13.408 --> 02:41:13.628
[SPEAKER_26]: Ouch.

02:41:14.169 --> 02:41:15.529
[SPEAKER_26]: But it must be done.

02:41:15.629 --> 02:41:15.870
[SPEAKER_26]: Why?

02:41:15.950 --> 02:41:22.753
[SPEAKER_26]: Because then I can get a better job later on or something or whatever you're supposed to do after you go to school.

02:41:22.953 --> 02:41:24.113
[SPEAKER_26]: Heh, heh, heh, heh.

02:41:24.373 --> 02:41:26.054
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, that's really it.

02:41:26.254 --> 02:41:29.036
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm not really that pissy this week or something.

02:41:30.276 --> 02:41:33.638
[SPEAKER_26]: So, um, yeah, until next time.

02:41:35.499 --> 02:41:37.399
[SPEAKER_06]: Xtifer, what are your FUs of the week?

02:41:38.480 --> 02:41:38.540
[SPEAKER_15]: Um,

02:41:39.810 --> 02:41:43.217
[SPEAKER_15]: F you to God, because if you really do exist, you're fucking with my week.

02:41:44.339 --> 02:41:46.544
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, Jesus Christ, God.

02:41:47.938 --> 02:41:53.720
[SPEAKER_15]: I am so fucking pissed off because I will be very, very fine and everything.

02:41:54.080 --> 02:41:57.822
[SPEAKER_15]: Then I go to the lab and I try to give blood and suddenly I almost faint.

02:41:57.862 --> 02:41:59.122
[SPEAKER_15]: You were trying to give blood.

02:41:59.242 --> 02:42:01.223
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, I was trying to get blood work done.

02:42:02.103 --> 02:42:09.406
[SPEAKER_15]: And now I have to go back to the lab because I couldn't do enough work and just more stuff that I have to think about doing.

02:42:10.346 --> 02:42:11.066
[SPEAKER_15]: So, yeah.

02:42:11.586 --> 02:42:12.327
[SPEAKER_15]: So F you to that.

02:42:12.747 --> 02:42:13.347
[SPEAKER_15]: F you to just...

02:42:17.188 --> 02:42:18.488
[SPEAKER_15]: Last week in general.

02:42:19.789 --> 02:42:20.229
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

02:42:21.129 --> 02:42:22.449
[SPEAKER_15]: It was just a really difficult week.

02:42:22.809 --> 02:42:24.930
[SPEAKER_15]: No, actually, you know, it ended really well.

02:42:25.030 --> 02:42:26.570
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, we had a good night last night.

02:42:27.530 --> 02:42:28.850
[SPEAKER_15]: Good partying.

02:42:29.951 --> 02:42:31.311
[SPEAKER_15]: Partaking in a partay.

02:42:32.611 --> 02:42:33.211
[SPEAKER_15]: It was neat.

02:42:34.491 --> 02:42:35.452
[SPEAKER_15]: It was nifty.

02:42:35.952 --> 02:42:36.852
[SPEAKER_15]: But otherwise, yeah.

02:42:37.912 --> 02:42:42.033
[SPEAKER_15]: Otherwise, F you to everyone who won't listen to my show tomorrow at 7 o'clock.

02:42:44.250 --> 02:42:48.253
[SPEAKER_15]: X-O-T-C-M Will you be playing Madonna hung up on your show?

02:42:48.313 --> 02:42:51.756
[SPEAKER_15]: I will not be playing that song.

02:42:52.436 --> 02:42:58.941
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I haven't even talked about the Rob Roberts show on Wednesday, which is going to be a big, huge Mondo OLR event.

02:42:59.341 --> 02:43:00.562
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm so freaking excited.

02:43:00.582 --> 02:43:01.663
[SPEAKER_06]: 7 o'clock Wednesday.

02:43:05.226 --> 02:43:07.027
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's get to our chatroom FUs.

02:43:09.514 --> 02:43:13.476
[SPEAKER_06]: Dark Knight says, F you to work and finding out that I have no car.

02:43:14.317 --> 02:43:18.119
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, F you to gas prices, even though they are starting to go down just a tad.

02:43:20.500 --> 02:43:21.881
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and whoops, where did my music go?

02:43:21.901 --> 02:43:25.443
[SPEAKER_06]: My music went away for the, uh... It's because you played that fucking Madonna song.

02:43:25.463 --> 02:43:27.344
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess I'll just have to go back to the fucking Madonna song.

02:43:27.364 --> 02:43:27.744
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, guys.

02:43:30.445 --> 02:43:32.646
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, let's see, whatever, uh, the other F yous here.

02:43:32.687 --> 02:43:33.687
[SPEAKER_06]: We got Ninst.

02:43:36.429 --> 02:43:37.109
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, whoops, I'm sorry.

02:43:38.561 --> 02:43:41.123
[SPEAKER_06]: That was, uh, it was, um, something else for me.

02:43:42.344 --> 02:43:47.668
[SPEAKER_06]: Um... Socorina says, F you to me for not voting for the cage match.

02:43:48.388 --> 02:43:54.733
[SPEAKER_06]: F you to my parents for being behind me when two hot girls asked me if I wanted to fuck them after clearing max 300 standard.

02:43:57.135 --> 02:43:57.475
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

02:43:58.356 --> 02:43:59.917
[SPEAKER_06]: That, that doesn't happen.

02:44:01.698 --> 02:44:02.039
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

02:44:06.102 --> 02:44:07.603
[SPEAKER_06]: Misty says, um...

02:44:09.674 --> 02:44:11.536
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, she was giving me a suggestion for FUs.

02:44:11.576 --> 02:44:13.317
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, I got to them a little late there.

02:44:13.877 --> 02:44:18.981
[SPEAKER_06]: NintendoManiac64 says, FU to Loki for commenting on what you did with my foot last night.

02:44:19.041 --> 02:44:19.942
[SPEAKER_06]: You and your sick mind.

02:44:21.042 --> 02:44:27.047
[SPEAKER_06]: FU to myself for forgetting to put a not before the word commenting in my previous FU, which would make that FU true.

[SPEAKER_06]: F you to Sky for talking during my Skype time.

02:44:30.462 --> 02:44:31.344
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, get over it.

02:44:31.945 --> 02:44:36.011
[SPEAKER_06]: F you to whoever chose the MK64 retro tracks in Mario Kart DS.

02:44:36.051 --> 02:44:37.494
[SPEAKER_06]: There's none of the awesome ones.

02:44:37.914 --> 02:44:39.998
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, they didn't put like Toad's Highway?

02:44:40.038 --> 02:44:41.080
[SPEAKER_06]: That was like the best track ever.

02:44:46.854 --> 02:44:50.936
[SPEAKER_06]: Glutwalk says F you to the coat hanger and the handicapped stall in the bathroom at my workplace.

02:44:51.376 --> 02:44:57.759
[SPEAKER_06]: That damn thing was placed so low it practically punctured my right arm and I've got a huge honking bruise the size of two silver dollars.

02:44:57.839 --> 02:44:58.300
[SPEAKER_06]: Damn you!

02:45:02.242 --> 02:45:08.525
[SPEAKER_06]: Color of Sakura says F you to the fact that I was diagnosed with a peptic ulcer last week and making me not able to do anything.

02:45:35.662 --> 02:45:36.663
[SPEAKER_06]: Aw, you guys did fine.

02:45:37.603 --> 02:45:41.806
[SPEAKER_06]: Duran says, F you to people who email 50 fucking times a day.

02:45:42.746 --> 02:45:45.508
[SPEAKER_06]: Specifically, F you to people who keep emailing me 50 times a day.

02:45:45.748 --> 02:45:47.089
[SPEAKER_06]: And are they all chain letters?

02:45:47.889 --> 02:45:48.570
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate that shit.

02:45:48.650 --> 02:45:49.030
[SPEAKER_06]: Me too.

02:45:49.250 --> 02:45:52.532
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why I'm kind of glad Myspace exists, because that's where all the chain letters go now.

02:45:53.390 --> 02:46:07.698
[SPEAKER_06]: GS191 says F you to Tommy Talarco for giving We Heart Katamari a fucking 3 out of 10 F you to my friend for bricking his PSP, he deserved it and a continuing F you to my online math class A 3 out of 10 for We Heart Katamari?

02:46:08.199 --> 02:46:22.627

02:46:24.232 --> 02:46:28.194
[SPEAKER_06]: Lesson to Zaku says, F you to Death for taking Captain Jack from this Earth on Friday.

[SPEAKER_06]: F you to this nagging stuffy nose I've been having these days.

02:46:32.896 --> 02:46:36.318

[SPEAKER_06]: Sephiroth1215 says, F you to Funimation for butchering Dragon Ball Z still.

02:46:42.781 --> 02:46:47.464
[SPEAKER_06]: Because even as I play Budokai Tenkashi, it still says...

02:46:49.338 --> 02:46:53.241
[SPEAKER_06]: HIFL instead of Hell, and Hercule instead of Mr. Satan.

02:46:53.721 --> 02:46:55.742
[SPEAKER_06]: The game is rated teen, you don't need to do that.

02:46:55.842 --> 02:46:58.284
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, you don't even need to do that with an E-rated game.

02:47:01.826 --> 02:47:05.327
[SPEAKER_06]: Roz says, F you to old ladies coughing on me for an hour and a half.

02:47:05.568 --> 02:47:09.470
[SPEAKER_06]: F you to the health teacher who accused me of plagiarism and then denied it like three days later.

02:47:10.828 --> 02:47:13.489
[SPEAKER_06]: What is it about science teachers and assholes, them being assholes?

02:47:13.529 --> 02:47:14.690
[SPEAKER_15]: In church, in general.

02:47:14.910 --> 02:47:15.430
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm kidding.

02:47:15.490 --> 02:47:20.232
[SPEAKER_06]: Ron Chan says, to go along with Loki, a massive F you to people who take clothes out of the laundry machines.

02:47:20.312 --> 02:47:21.933
[SPEAKER_06]: No one told you to touch my clothes, okay?

02:47:22.213 --> 02:47:24.654
[SPEAKER_06]: You can wait five fucking minutes until I walk back into the laundromat.

02:47:25.014 --> 02:47:28.496
[SPEAKER_06]: And on behalf of the chatroom, F you to Socorina for talking smack about Captain Jack.

02:47:32.017 --> 02:47:34.358
[SPEAKER_06]: Lego Freak says, F you to every girl.

02:47:34.518 --> 02:47:35.479
[SPEAKER_06]: Why don't they like me?

02:47:37.967 --> 02:47:44.856
[SPEAKER_06]: and then lastly, Dirty Thief says, F you to my friend who hit me in the crotch with a shoe twice in one day.

02:47:49.081 --> 02:47:50.082
[SPEAKER_06]: That sounds pretty hot.

02:47:52.165 --> 02:47:52.806
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, though...

02:47:53.570 --> 02:48:00.093
[SPEAKER_15]: That is a segment in America's Funniest Home Videos that's so way overdone.

02:48:00.873 --> 02:48:03.374
[SPEAKER_15]: They always have those videos of people getting hit in the crotch.

02:48:03.834 --> 02:48:04.815
[SPEAKER_15]: And they're not funny.

02:48:05.375 --> 02:48:06.476
[SPEAKER_15]: They're not funny.

02:48:07.656 --> 02:48:10.217
[SPEAKER_15]: They're totally insanely not funny.

02:48:11.078 --> 02:48:13.739
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I saw on a sale for DVD?

02:48:14.059 --> 02:48:17.580
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like freaking America's Funniest Home Videos, like an entire season on DVD.

02:48:17.620 --> 02:48:18.781
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, why would you buy this?

02:48:18.941 --> 02:48:19.101
[SPEAKER_06]: Why?

02:48:19.571 --> 02:48:23.575
[SPEAKER_15]: I know, they show it on PAX TV or like all those other channels, TNT.

02:48:23.715 --> 02:48:24.696
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it on ABC?

02:48:25.758 --> 02:48:26.699
[SPEAKER_15]: I think they still play it.

02:48:26.719 --> 02:48:28.601
[SPEAKER_06]: Still hosted by Tom Bergeron now or whatever?

02:48:28.921 --> 02:48:29.081
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

02:48:29.101 --> 02:48:30.302
[SPEAKER_06]: The guy that was on Hollywood Squares?

02:48:30.342 --> 02:48:31.363
[SPEAKER_06]: Better than Bob Saget.

02:48:31.383 --> 02:48:32.425
[SPEAKER_06]: Is Hollywood Squares still on?

02:48:33.586 --> 02:48:34.166
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think so.

02:48:34.186 --> 02:48:34.927
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's too bad.

02:48:35.408 --> 02:48:37.009
[SPEAKER_06]: Whoopi Goldberg was a cool center square.

02:48:37.029 --> 02:48:38.411
[SPEAKER_06]: Just thought I'd share.

02:48:38.531 --> 02:48:39.232
[SPEAKER_06]: Really like her?

02:48:39.892 --> 02:48:40.273
[SPEAKER_06]: Not really.

02:48:40.553 --> 02:48:40.633
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh.

02:48:46.846 --> 02:48:53.024
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, what we're going to do now, I think we'll go to a quick break, and then when we come back, maybe Ask Orange Lounge for a little bit?

02:48:53.897 --> 02:48:56.539
[SPEAKER_15]: Ask me anything Ask Orange Lounge Get your questions in now

02:49:23.061 --> 02:49:37.462
[SPEAKER_10]: Dreamer Dreamer, take me in your dream Take me anywhere you please Boy, you're making me scream Dreamer Dreamer, life is just a dream If you wanna set me free Boy, you're making me scream Ooh, la-da-dee, la-da-dee

02:50:00.755 --> 02:50:12.035
Hey, here we go again, turn it up my friend No, we don't stop, we rock the spot No, we don't wait, get ready, all this is it Do you like to dream?

02:50:12.075 --> 02:50:14.058
Hey, I like to dream, baby

02:50:45.370 --> 02:50:50.354
[SPEAKER_06]: And just so you guys know, the only thing better than dream a dream is more dream a dream.

02:50:55.818 --> 02:51:00.361
[SPEAKER_23]: Let's dream a dream together.

02:51:02.043 --> 02:51:04.745
[SPEAKER_23]: A dream that is real.

02:52:22.268 --> 02:52:26.150
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Lounge Radio, Mamani Music, and more.

02:52:26.290 --> 02:52:27.971
[SPEAKER_11]: Pa-pa-pa-perfect!

02:52:34.414 --> 02:52:35.674
[SPEAKER_06]: That's Sask Orange Lounge.

02:52:36.255 --> 02:52:37.355
[SPEAKER_06]: Some stupid question.

02:52:37.875 --> 02:52:41.097
[SPEAKER_06]: What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?

02:52:41.577 --> 02:52:48.560
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm curious to see if Extover actually got any questions, but it would be nice if we would stop talking about Madonna for once.

02:52:51.448 --> 02:52:53.329
[SPEAKER_15]: That was a laughing riot there.

02:52:53.790 --> 02:52:55.771
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sure everybody just dropped everything they did.

02:52:57.392 --> 02:53:01.896
[SPEAKER_15]: Exploding laughter.

02:53:01.996 --> 02:53:05.498
[SPEAKER_05]: Rene wants to know, what will it take to get MidiHead on the show?

02:53:06.539 --> 02:53:09.881
[SPEAKER_06]: And Sky, Mr. Moripovich would like to know, are you the father?

02:53:12.924 --> 02:53:14.665
[SPEAKER_06]: The last time I had sex with a woman.

02:53:16.186 --> 02:53:16.566
[SPEAKER_06]: Never mind.

02:53:18.227 --> 02:53:18.848
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a kiss.

02:53:19.976 --> 02:53:21.517
[SPEAKER_06]: What would it take to get MiniHead on the show?

02:53:21.597 --> 02:53:28.522
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably if we just ask really nicely, and we do want to get him on the show sometime around the release time of Ultramix 3, so I look forward to it.

02:53:28.602 --> 02:53:29.583
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure he'll do it.

02:53:29.823 --> 02:53:31.525
[SPEAKER_06]: We just have to ask really nicely, so we will.

02:53:31.865 --> 02:53:33.966
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll have our people talk to his people, and we'll let you guys know.

02:53:35.087 --> 02:53:36.148
[SPEAKER_06]: Rini also wants to know...

02:53:37.463 --> 02:53:41.946
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that promo with Something Something making Captain Jack cry getting retired?

02:53:42.567 --> 02:53:43.628
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, we don't know yet.

02:53:44.088 --> 02:53:44.748
[SPEAKER_06]: We think so.

02:53:45.529 --> 02:53:48.831
[SPEAKER_06]: But we definitely don't want to retire Copy Kills Music, because that thing's awesome.

02:53:49.492 --> 02:53:51.693
[SPEAKER_06]: But as far as the promo, you know what?

02:53:51.833 --> 02:53:55.456
[SPEAKER_06]: All of our old promos really need to be retired, but we're just too lazy to make new ones.

02:53:55.776 --> 02:53:57.457
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe we should have a promo making contest.

02:53:57.477 --> 02:53:58.939
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe that's how we could get rid of this, uh...

02:53:59.824 --> 02:54:00.544
[SPEAKER_06]: DDR Extreme 2.

02:54:00.764 --> 02:54:01.745
[SPEAKER_06]: I wonder if people would do it.

02:54:02.165 --> 02:54:02.505
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't know.

02:54:02.525 --> 02:54:07.086
[SPEAKER_06]: Chatroom, would you guys make us promos if we gave away an Extreme 2 bundle?

02:54:07.846 --> 02:54:09.026
[SPEAKER_06]: An official Konami softpad?

02:54:10.587 --> 02:54:11.167
[SPEAKER_06]: That might be cool.

02:54:13.167 --> 02:54:14.248
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's get to some more questions.

02:54:19.269 --> 02:54:22.670
[SPEAKER_06]: Sakurina wants to know, is 69 easier with a hard-on?

02:54:24.787 --> 02:54:25.447
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate the question.

02:54:25.467 --> 02:54:28.269
[SPEAKER_06]: And yes, my advice would be that you have a hard-on when you do a 69.

02:54:54.290 --> 02:54:59.935
[SPEAKER_06]: Legend of Zaku is wondering aloud in a question, are they going to bury Captain Jack in his trademark uniform?

02:55:01.276 --> 02:55:02.977
[SPEAKER_06]: You always know there's got to be somebody thinking morbid.

02:55:07.422 --> 02:55:09.804
[SPEAKER_06]: If I were Captain Jack, I would want to be buried in the uniform.

02:55:10.044 --> 02:55:11.285
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they have to.

02:55:11.585 --> 02:55:13.907
[SPEAKER_06]: When was he not in that uniform, honestly?

02:55:14.548 --> 02:55:15.429
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they should.

02:55:18.618 --> 02:55:21.800
[SPEAKER_15]: I love how everybody gets so mad when people ask me a question.

02:55:22.360 --> 02:55:24.881
[SPEAKER_15]: Like I'm gonna, you know, take offense or something.

02:55:25.562 --> 02:55:26.242
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, let's see.

02:55:26.302 --> 02:55:30.645
[SPEAKER_06]: NintendoManiac64 wants to know, why am I eating cheddar Chex Mix instead of ranch Doritos?

02:55:31.185 --> 02:55:32.185
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, because it's less fattening?

02:55:32.285 --> 02:55:32.586
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

02:55:33.126 --> 02:55:36.668
[SPEAKER_06]: Why are none of the awesome Mario Kart 64 tracks in Mario Kart DS?

02:55:36.968 --> 02:55:42.151
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, because Nintendo will release Mario Kart DS Extreme or something that has the extra tracks in it later?

02:55:42.211 --> 02:55:43.872
[SPEAKER_06]: Has Mario Kart DS even come out yet?

02:55:44.092 --> 02:55:44.912
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

02:55:45.453 --> 02:55:47.053
[SPEAKER_06]: How do you know they're not unlockables?

02:55:47.334 --> 02:55:47.434
[SPEAKER_28]: Hmm?

02:55:51.400 --> 02:55:54.822
[SPEAKER_06]: So, Loki, what did you exactly do with my foot last night?

02:55:54.882 --> 02:55:57.304
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone in chat wants to hear your sick, perverted, gay thoughts.

02:55:58.144 --> 02:56:00.445
[SPEAKER_06]: I have no idea what he's... That was like an hour ago on the show.

02:56:00.465 --> 02:56:01.086
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't even remember.

02:56:01.526 --> 02:56:04.088
[SPEAKER_06]: I wasn't even paying attention then.

02:56:04.128 --> 02:56:07.770
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, any of you guys or chatroom folks go to... Beep!

02:56:08.110 --> 02:56:09.231
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody's trying to hoard their website.

02:56:09.611 --> 02:56:10.491
[SPEAKER_06]: Once it's complete.

02:56:11.312 --> 02:56:13.353
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, complete it, and then we'll say the website.

02:56:13.933 --> 02:56:15.054
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't even visited yet.

02:56:15.114 --> 02:56:16.035
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll visit it.

02:56:17.155 --> 02:56:17.816
[SPEAKER_06]: Send me an email.

02:56:17.856 --> 02:56:18.676
[SPEAKER_06]: Ask me really nicely.

02:56:18.716 --> 02:56:19.857
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll visit it and give you my opinion.

02:56:21.587 --> 02:56:24.588
[SPEAKER_06]: Illusion wants to know, now what's it all about, Alfie?

02:56:26.129 --> 02:56:28.270
[SPEAKER_06]: Seeing a good movie for a change would be my answer.

02:56:28.610 --> 02:56:33.051
[SPEAKER_06]: A movie, yeah, Alfie sucked.

02:56:36.053 --> 02:56:37.593
[SPEAKER_06]: It's lame, that's all you need to know.

02:56:39.014 --> 02:56:41.175
[SPEAKER_06]: Lego Freak wants to know, hey buddy, can I have $100?

02:56:41.215 --> 02:56:41.835
[SPEAKER_06]: Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.

02:56:45.211 --> 02:56:51.173
[SPEAKER_06]: One day when we're rich and famous, we'll give away cash and fabulous prizes on the show, and we'll remember your support.

02:57:09.315 --> 02:57:14.357
[SPEAKER_06]: Goggle wants to know, after no field trips the past three years, I have two coming up in the next two weeks.

02:57:14.757 --> 02:57:20.098
[SPEAKER_06]: Should I go on both and risk missing work, or only go on one and get all my work done?

02:57:20.458 --> 02:57:21.659
[SPEAKER_06]: It kind of depends where you're going.

02:57:21.699 --> 02:57:23.679
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, are you going to the pumpkin patch?

02:57:23.739 --> 02:57:25.960
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, if you're going to the pumpkin patch, fuck that shit.

02:57:25.980 --> 02:57:27.621
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't need to go to the pumpkin patch.

02:57:27.921 --> 02:57:33.182
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you're going to, like, I don't know, Hooters, then go.

02:57:33.603 --> 02:57:34.223
[SPEAKER_15]: Then go.

02:57:36.463 --> 02:57:38.264
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, if it's to Canada, I would go to Canada.

02:57:39.424 --> 02:57:45.729
[SPEAKER_06]: Duran wants to know, I need an NES, can I have yours?

02:57:57.543 --> 02:57:58.763
[SPEAKER_06]: My NES is broken.

02:57:59.163 --> 02:58:05.025
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it won't even play the cartridges after I blow on them like there's no tomorrow.

02:58:06.925 --> 02:58:08.265
[SPEAKER_06]: My NES just don't work no more.

02:58:08.325 --> 02:58:11.886
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you want a broken paperweight, I guess you could have that.

02:58:14.067 --> 02:58:16.367
[SPEAKER_26]: No one ever asks me any questions.

02:58:17.348 --> 02:58:19.288
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you want to give your NES to Duran?

02:58:20.439 --> 02:58:25.704
[SPEAKER_26]: No, I actually have the one that top loads, if you remember that one.

02:58:25.724 --> 02:58:26.324
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, lucky you.

02:58:27.125 --> 02:58:29.367
[SPEAKER_26]: And I have the original as well.

02:58:30.848 --> 02:58:32.570
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes, they work, and no, you can't have them.

02:58:34.071 --> 02:58:36.193
[SPEAKER_26]: Otherwise, I can't play Guardian Legends, so there.

02:58:39.469 --> 02:58:41.490
[SPEAKER_06]: Goggle wanted to clarify the two field trips.

02:58:41.550 --> 02:58:44.591
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a museum on one day and a play on the other.

02:58:45.712 --> 02:58:46.412
[SPEAKER_06]: Go to the play.

02:58:47.172 --> 02:58:48.953
[SPEAKER_06]: I think both are worth it, and here's why.

02:58:48.993 --> 02:58:57.136
[SPEAKER_06]: The museum, you're going to see nudity at the museum, because in classic arts, there's going to be nudity, and in sculptures and stuff, usually there's a naked one or two, like a bust.

02:58:57.156 --> 02:58:59.397
[SPEAKER_06]: Artistic nudity is not that great.

02:58:59.537 --> 02:59:00.238
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but it's nudity.

02:59:00.578 --> 02:59:04.161
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you should see the play, because there's a chance of nudity, depending on what the play is.

02:59:04.461 --> 02:59:07.583
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, if it's a little G-rated musical, like The Lion King, forget it.

02:59:07.904 --> 02:59:10.305
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, if it's something else, like, you know, hair?

02:59:10.345 --> 02:59:11.406
[SPEAKER_15]: You don't even need nudity.

02:59:11.466 --> 02:59:15.269
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, if they're wearing tights, you're going to see their package.

02:59:16.170 --> 02:59:23.916
[SPEAKER_15]: So, I mean, you know, if you see penal structure behind that, you know, tight that the guy's... Goggle, go where the nudity is.

02:59:24.056 --> 02:59:26.198
[SPEAKER_06]: That's my advice, my sound advice to you.

02:59:30.394 --> 02:59:31.154
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, that's it.

02:59:31.314 --> 02:59:31.715
[SPEAKER_06]: We're done.

02:59:31.935 --> 02:59:32.695
[SPEAKER_06]: We're done with this show.

02:59:33.696 --> 02:59:34.997
[SPEAKER_06]: Put the nail in the coffin of the show.

02:59:35.037 --> 02:59:35.337
[SPEAKER_06]: We're done.

02:59:35.657 --> 02:59:38.879
[SPEAKER_15]: I was pretty PG-13 tonight, wouldn't you say so, Rob Roberts?

02:59:38.899 --> 02:59:41.941
[SPEAKER_06]: You did a fairly good job, extrovert extroverson.

02:59:45.876 --> 02:59:46.957
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what else to call you.

02:59:47.437 --> 02:59:48.798
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't have a stage last name yet.

02:59:48.838 --> 02:59:49.378
[SPEAKER_06]: You need one.

02:59:49.718 --> 02:59:50.699
[SPEAKER_15]: It's going to be Extifer.

02:59:51.840 --> 02:59:55.362
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's going to be on the show tomorrow.

02:59:56.182 --> 02:59:57.223
[SPEAKER_15]: Rob, pitch my show.

02:59:58.363 --> 03:00:00.084
[SPEAKER_06]: Listen to the Rob Roberts show on Wednesday.

03:00:00.144 --> 03:00:00.825
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be a good time.

03:00:01.025 --> 03:00:01.565
[SPEAKER_06]: Shut the fuck up.

03:00:01.945 --> 03:00:02.866
[SPEAKER_15]: Pitch the real show.

03:00:02.986 --> 03:00:03.506
[SPEAKER_06]: Shut the fuck up!

03:00:03.626 --> 03:00:04.186
[SPEAKER_15]: Shut the fuck up!

03:00:09.009 --> 03:00:09.549
[SPEAKER_06]: Final thoughts.

03:00:10.690 --> 03:00:11.551
[SPEAKER_06]: Angel, your final thought.

03:00:15.171 --> 03:00:17.192
[SPEAKER_26]: I want to go home and play World of Warcraft.

03:00:17.812 --> 03:00:18.072
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh!

03:00:19.453 --> 03:00:20.874
[SPEAKER_06]: Extra for your final thought.

03:00:20.894 --> 03:00:21.734
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, damn, you didn't say it.

03:00:21.754 --> 03:00:22.254
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I'm sorry.

03:00:22.874 --> 03:00:23.375
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, addict?

03:00:23.495 --> 03:00:25.416
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's reserved for Final Fantasy XI.

03:00:25.436 --> 03:00:26.856
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll think of another word for World of Warcraft.

03:00:28.557 --> 03:00:29.457
[SPEAKER_06]: Extra for your final thought.

03:00:30.738 --> 03:00:32.859
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to go home and play World of Warcraft.

03:00:34.160 --> 03:00:34.780
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh!

03:00:35.820 --> 03:00:37.361
[SPEAKER_10]: But you're already home!

03:00:40.803 --> 03:00:43.544
[SPEAKER_06]: He's going to come over to your house, and that will be like the worst thing ever.

03:00:43.564 --> 03:00:43.604
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

03:00:45.003 --> 03:00:45.383
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki!

03:00:48.064 --> 03:00:56.447
[SPEAKER_06]: Um... I hope this works... And... It doesn't work.

03:00:56.527 --> 03:00:57.087
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it doesn't.

03:00:57.187 --> 03:00:57.408
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

03:00:58.708 --> 03:00:59.288
[SPEAKER_06]: Son of a bitch.

03:00:59.388 --> 03:01:05.971
[SPEAKER_06]: By the way, I'd just like to point out that we've actually been short two hosts tonight, because DarkSakura isn't here, and Loki has just really not been involved in the show.

03:01:05.991 --> 03:01:09.432
[SPEAKER_06]: He's been working on something for the site the whole night, so he could care less about this show.

03:01:10.260 --> 03:01:12.381
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm participating.

03:01:12.581 --> 03:01:15.702
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki does not care about Orange Lounge people.

03:01:18.323 --> 03:01:19.723
[SPEAKER_06]: I goddamn hate PHP.

03:01:21.004 --> 03:01:21.244
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

03:01:22.724 --> 03:01:25.225
[SPEAKER_06]: My final thought is I want to top loading NES now.

03:01:25.805 --> 03:01:26.226
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm jealous.

03:01:26.286 --> 03:01:29.027
[SPEAKER_26]: I can bring mine over and you can play games if you want.

03:01:29.047 --> 03:01:29.567
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have Kid Icarus?

03:01:31.894 --> 03:01:32.575
[SPEAKER_26]: It ain't worth it.

03:01:32.695 --> 03:01:34.055
[SPEAKER_15]: If you don't have Kid Icarus, it ain't worth it.

03:01:34.075 --> 03:01:36.797
[SPEAKER_26]: Magus might, so yes.

03:01:37.057 --> 03:01:39.478
[SPEAKER_15]: Why is that game so wonderful?

03:01:39.618 --> 03:01:41.019
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it's Kid Icarus, motherfucker.

03:01:41.039 --> 03:01:44.081
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, it was the fucking hardest game that I played when I played it.

03:01:44.101 --> 03:01:44.281
[SPEAKER_15]: I beat it.

03:01:44.361 --> 03:01:45.462
[SPEAKER_15]: I beat it because I'm the shit.

03:01:46.442 --> 03:01:47.363
[SPEAKER_15]: You are the shit.

03:01:48.543 --> 03:01:49.444
[SPEAKER_15]: Keep going with that, Rob.

03:01:50.284 --> 03:01:54.446
[SPEAKER_15]: But meanwhile, I still think that it was kind of difficult.

03:01:54.626 --> 03:01:57.268
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe it was just because I'm not video game prone or something.

03:01:57.288 --> 03:01:57.448
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe.

03:01:58.004 --> 03:01:58.524
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe that's it.

03:01:59.365 --> 03:02:00.765
[SPEAKER_15]: I beat Legend of Zelda.

03:02:01.466 --> 03:02:01.826
[SPEAKER_15]: Good job.

03:02:02.186 --> 03:02:03.047
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, no problem.

03:02:03.067 --> 03:02:04.627
[SPEAKER_15]: Did you beat the second quest, though?

03:02:04.928 --> 03:02:05.408
[SPEAKER_15]: I did.

03:02:05.948 --> 03:02:06.448
[SPEAKER_15]: I did beat it.

03:02:06.468 --> 03:02:06.648
[SPEAKER_06]: Good job.

03:02:06.689 --> 03:02:07.549
[SPEAKER_15]: Did you beat Zelda 2?

03:02:08.489 --> 03:02:09.810
[SPEAKER_15]: I didn't.

03:02:10.150 --> 03:02:11.071
[SPEAKER_06]: You suck!

03:02:11.571 --> 03:02:12.031
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

03:02:13.572 --> 03:02:14.753
[SPEAKER_06]: Final word of the show.

03:02:14.953 --> 03:02:16.494
[SPEAKER_06]: One word to sum it all up.

03:02:16.774 --> 03:02:17.374
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob Roberts?

03:02:17.634 --> 03:02:17.814
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

03:02:18.795 --> 03:02:19.955
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, do I get to give the final word?

03:02:19.975 --> 03:02:21.356
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe you do, because you never do.

03:02:21.376 --> 03:02:23.577
[SPEAKER_06]: I never do do the final word of the show.

03:02:23.597 --> 03:02:24.978
[SPEAKER_06]: Goddammit, do the final word of the show.

03:02:24.998 --> 03:02:26.699
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, here's the final word of tonight's show.

03:02:33.109 --> 03:02:37.970
[SPEAKER_33]: That does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live.

03:02:38.791 --> 03:02:42.992
