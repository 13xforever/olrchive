It means a lot to us, so not just me here on this program, Rob Roberts, but also I'm

00:42.140 --> 00:45.060
joined by the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

00:45.060 --> 00:46.060
Not going anywhere.

00:46.060 --> 00:49.140
That's right, he's still here, and the one and only Loki.

00:49.140 --> 00:50.140
That's right, I'm here.

00:50.140 --> 00:51.140
All right.

00:51.140 --> 00:52.140
First off, I want to...

00:52.140 --> 00:53.140
We're still working on that.

00:53.140 --> 00:54.820
We were trying to vote him out.

00:54.820 --> 00:57.780
We had an alliance going on, so we could get one step closer to the million.

00:57.780 --> 01:00.780
I lied about my grandma dying, and then that's how I stayed in.

01:00.780 --> 01:03.740
Anyway, that's a different podcast, people.

01:03.740 --> 01:08.740
All right, anyway, starting off tonight, I want to talk about OLRPSP.com, the brand new

01:08.740 --> 01:12.900
PSP website that we launched recently.

01:12.900 --> 01:14.900
Been getting a lot of great feedback.

01:14.900 --> 01:18.460
A couple of really big PSP sites ran stories on it, and that's just awesome, so thanks

01:18.460 --> 01:22.940
you guys, the PSP community, for responding so well, and those of you guys that are downloading

01:22.940 --> 01:27.940
the show on to your PSP, enjoy. Great use for your PSP, all this stuff, so.

01:27.940 --> 01:29.940
Still working on more stuff for it too.

01:29.940 --> 01:31.940
Yeah, Loki's still working on that website, so.

01:31.940 --> 01:35.940
Yeah, we're looking at maybe a shell box and looking at chat, possibly.

01:35.940 --> 01:43.940
Alright, we'll see. So check out OLRPSP.com and celebrate OLRPSP.com. How about a giveaway?

01:43.940 --> 01:44.940
Sounds good to me!

01:44.940 --> 01:49.940
Alright, we're going to do a giveaway. We're going to give away copies of Death Jr. and Coded Arms,

01:49.940 --> 01:53.220
are the two games that we're giving away.

01:53.220 --> 01:54.980
We're gonna give away Death Junior to one winner

01:54.980 --> 01:56.260
and Coded Arms to another winner.

01:56.260 --> 01:58.680
So two separate prizes here, two separate winners.

01:58.680 --> 02:02.700
All you gotta do, email freestuff at orangelountrader.com.

02:02.700 --> 02:06.740
Free stuff, no spaces or dashes or anything,

02:06.740 --> 02:08.580
just freestuff at orangelountrader.com

02:08.580 --> 02:09.820
and somebody's gonna win Death Junior

02:09.820 --> 02:11.900
and somebody's gonna win Coded Arms.

02:11.900 --> 02:12.760
It's just that easy.

02:12.760 --> 02:16.580
We won't spam you, we won't put you on any list or anything.

02:16.580 --> 02:18.780
Just send us an email and you might win.

02:18.780 --> 02:22.780
but if you put a funny message in there that uses bad grammar, I will laugh at you.

02:22.780 --> 02:27.780
Alright. Let's start off tonight's show talking about how our gaming week was going.

02:27.780 --> 02:29.780
DarkSakura, how's your gaming week been?

02:29.780 --> 02:35.780
Busy. Actually, I had the week off of school, so I basically sat around and did, you know, crap all day.

02:35.780 --> 02:40.780
Well, of course I had work, but I played some Nintendogs, although I do not know where my DS is now.

02:40.780 --> 02:42.780
Oops. I think I locked my DS in the drawer at work.

02:42.780 --> 02:44.780
Did the dog eat it?

02:44.780 --> 02:45.780
What dog? I have a cat.

02:45.780 --> 02:46.780
I'm just teasing.

03:16.780 --> 03:20.220
We heart kind of already though as it's cracked out. It still makes me emotion sick. All right

03:21.100 --> 03:23.100
um

03:23.180 --> 03:29.180
What else about god's playing lots of stuff dan's been playing the hell out of uh need for speed underground 2 on xbox

03:30.220 --> 03:32.620
Lots of racing i'm so sick of hearing

03:34.940 --> 03:38.220
When I get home, but he did make me an evo so I forgive him

03:39.100 --> 03:41.340
Very cool because he said that car was dedicated to me

03:41.340 --> 03:45.860
He's dedicating a virtual car we can never afford, well actually technically we can't

03:45.860 --> 03:47.260
afford one right now.

03:47.260 --> 03:50.380
However, in the real world.

03:50.380 --> 03:52.780
Like an Xbox 360 and a Playstation 3 and a Revolution.

03:52.780 --> 03:57.060
Xbox 360 does not come first on that list.

03:57.060 --> 03:59.060
Release date-wise, yes.

03:59.060 --> 04:01.860
Opinion-wise, no.

04:01.860 --> 04:04.060
Anything else you've been gaming with this week?

04:04.060 --> 04:10.860
God yeah, playing lots of Taiko no Tatsujin, Taiko Drum Master, I have the US one.

04:10.860 --> 04:15.300
roommate extra fur yes we have our Firefly Monday a Firefly fight Friday

04:15.300 --> 04:20.380
right and afterwards we went out we know we kidnapped my husband and all went out

04:20.380 --> 04:25.940
to Lions and came back which is a restaurant yeah yeah late night Lions on

04:25.940 --> 04:31.380
Firefly Friday and played lots of Taiko no Tatsujin and my hands are all bruised

04:31.380 --> 04:34.260
and we're watching the cracked out opening sleep deprived thing you're so

04:34.260 --> 04:37.340
cute how does the Japanese version compare to the English version and when

04:37.340 --> 04:40.140
was the last time Jamie played Japanese version oh you haven't played it I

04:40.140 --> 04:42.000
I thought, yeah, I've played both.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.440
I haven't in my time.

04:43.440 --> 04:46.840
The English one is a little bit scaled down compared to the Japanese ones.

04:46.840 --> 04:48.320
It's a lot scaled down.

04:48.320 --> 04:49.320
But it's still cute.

04:49.320 --> 04:51.760
It's cute, but I'm gonna go on and import the others.

04:51.760 --> 04:54.920
I didn't honestly have much interest in it beforehand.

04:54.920 --> 04:58.440
But now that, I mean, I played it before, but I just was like, eh.

04:58.440 --> 05:02.360
The Arcade one is a heck of a lot of fun, because the Taiko drum is like, Taiko, it's

05:02.360 --> 05:03.360
actual size.

05:03.360 --> 05:04.480
It's a heck of a lot of fun.

05:04.480 --> 05:06.060
I like playing the Arcade version.

05:06.060 --> 05:10.660
Of course, I only know of one arcade, and that's in LA, which is not exactly around

05:10.660 --> 05:11.660
the corner from us.

05:11.660 --> 05:13.940
They need to bring out the PSP version here.

05:13.940 --> 05:15.820
It's a lot of fun.

05:15.820 --> 05:19.060
It's not the same when you've got a game like that on the PSP.

05:19.060 --> 05:23.420
It's not the same when you've got a game like that on the PSP because there's no taiko drum.

05:23.420 --> 05:24.420
It still works.

05:24.420 --> 05:25.420
Yawn, whoring, whatever.

05:25.420 --> 05:30.200
I'll say Dan's been playing Castlevania Dawn of Sorrow.

05:30.200 --> 05:32.660
I'm definitely going to touch on that later because I picked that up too.

05:32.660 --> 05:33.660
It's looking pretty nice.

05:33.660 --> 05:35.660
Did you get a chance to play it yourself yet?

05:35.660 --> 05:37.660
I turned it on in the bathroom.

05:37.660 --> 05:39.660
He left the DS in there.

05:39.660 --> 05:40.660
All right.

05:40.660 --> 05:43.660
I trip over the thing because he has a half-hanging...

05:43.660 --> 05:46.660
We have this hanging basket in our bathroom, and he had it sticking out,

05:46.660 --> 05:48.660
and I ran into it and knocked it across the floor.

05:48.660 --> 05:51.660
I was like, oh shit, did I break it down the DS?

05:51.660 --> 05:53.660
I was getting on my...

05:53.660 --> 05:55.660
Because I keep the cat box in the bathroom too.

05:55.660 --> 05:58.660
I was afraid I knocked it into the cat litter.

05:58.660 --> 05:59.660
Oops.

05:59.660 --> 06:00.660
Wow.

06:00.660 --> 06:01.660
All right.

06:01.660 --> 06:05.660
I've been playing World of Warcraft 2.

06:05.660 --> 06:06.660
How's that going?

06:06.660 --> 06:09.660
Really, it's tons of fun.

06:09.660 --> 06:11.660
Did you catch that disease that was going around in World of Warcraft?

06:11.660 --> 06:13.660
That was before I started playing, thank you.

06:13.660 --> 06:19.660
I think the disease is hilarious, because it is actually the first true

06:19.660 --> 06:22.660
first virtually created virus.

06:22.660 --> 06:26.660
You know, I was reading something, it didn't make the cut for tonight's stories,

06:26.660 --> 06:30.660
but something about that some official government agency is using that to

06:30.660 --> 06:36.320
to study disease control now that would happen in World of Warcraft. So strange to me, but

06:36.320 --> 06:37.320
interesting.

06:37.320 --> 06:41.800
But it's pretty cool, because the thing is that it was passing to any character in the

06:41.800 --> 06:42.800
game.

06:42.800 --> 06:45.880
Because, you know, people can teleport in real life.

06:45.880 --> 06:54.080
But the thing is that it was passing on to any standing character in the game that anyone

06:54.080 --> 07:01.180
talks to, and it was passing to the NPCs, and that's how it was spreading, is that people

07:01.180 --> 07:07.200
would contract whatever that is, heal themselves, they would contract it, teleport in, talk

07:07.200 --> 07:11.440
to the NPC, heal themselves, the NPC gets it, passes it on, because it cuts something

07:11.440 --> 07:17.920
like 200 and something life each time it drops, for someone who's level 50, that doesn't matter,

07:17.920 --> 07:23.620
for someone who's just starting off, that's instant death, and it keeps happening.

07:23.620 --> 07:29.620
So they counteracted it by having them infected with something else or it's fixed but I never

07:29.620 --> 07:30.860
had to worry about it.

07:30.860 --> 07:31.860
Interesting.

07:31.860 --> 07:34.340
Lucky, what have you been playing this week?

07:34.340 --> 07:36.020
I've been playing Burnout Revenge.

07:36.020 --> 07:39.140
Did you play anything besides Burnout?

07:39.140 --> 07:42.060
I played Burnout Legends.

07:42.060 --> 07:45.380
You're becoming a broken record.

07:45.380 --> 07:50.220
Sorry, you know, I played this during the week and I don't have time to play stuff during

07:50.220 --> 07:51.220
a home.

07:51.220 --> 07:55.820
I really wish I did, but I played Nintendogs.

07:55.820 --> 07:56.820
Taco's still alive.

07:56.820 --> 07:59.020
I'm kind of done with Nintendogs now.

07:59.020 --> 08:00.020
Me too.

08:00.020 --> 08:01.020
I'm done.

08:01.020 --> 08:02.020
I don't really care about Taco anymore.

08:02.020 --> 08:04.500
I guess the virtual pet thing wasn't for me.

08:04.500 --> 08:08.060
It's just I lost the attention to it, because you can't really do that much.

08:08.060 --> 08:10.540
It's still a great game, but it's just, I don't know.

08:10.540 --> 08:13.820
It's fun to throw bones and stuff at their head, but it's just, you know.

08:13.820 --> 08:14.820
The Bark Ball.

08:14.820 --> 08:15.820
It's all about the Bark Ball.

08:15.820 --> 08:18.460
Maybe if there's expansions later on that your dog can learn to do more things.

08:18.460 --> 08:20.460
When you quit playing, give me all your stuff.

08:20.460 --> 08:24.500
Alright, we'll see, we'll see. Because I have a Mario hat, it's pretty cool.

08:24.500 --> 08:27.420
I'm just waiting for Animal Crossing though.

08:27.420 --> 08:32.020
I'm so looking forward to the Wi-Fi, it's going to be awesome. It's going to be cool,

08:32.020 --> 08:35.580
except, I mean, how's that going to work with people coming into your town? I mean, we could have

08:35.580 --> 08:36.500
like people like

08:36.500 --> 08:40.180
destroying towns. I'm sure they have tested this thing into the ground, they'll

08:40.180 --> 08:44.340
have a way to do it. Folks can interact with us in our town. You probably can only

08:44.340 --> 08:48.100
allow certain, you probably get to allow who comes into your town and which trains

08:48.100 --> 08:48.940
can run into your town.

08:48.940 --> 08:52.300
it's going to be interesting. I feel like bark mode. Maybe.

08:52.300 --> 08:56.060
I think it's going to be like bark mode. You have to be in like town mode or something.

08:56.060 --> 08:57.860
But Wi-Fi somehow.

08:57.860 --> 09:02.340
It's on the internet. It'd be interesting. Obviously you can't run when your DS is off, so you'd be able to monitor

09:02.340 --> 09:03.900
who's coming in and out of your town, so

09:03.900 --> 09:08.140
it'll be interesting. No retro game stuff pisses me off. I know.

09:08.140 --> 09:12.260
Bad Nintendo. Bad. I got to play against the

09:12.260 --> 09:16.940
Mario voice. At E3? At E3. Oh yeah. The whole reason I... And you said I was lovely.

09:16.940 --> 09:22.400
The whole reason I bought Animal Crossing was because it had all those old Nintendo

09:22.400 --> 09:26.920
games hidden in it, and come to find out Animal Crossing was actually a really freaking great

09:26.920 --> 09:31.940
game in itself, and so I'm looking forward to the sequel, or I guess what I originally

09:31.940 --> 09:34.400
thought was just going to be another port of the game, but now it's looking more like

09:34.400 --> 09:35.400
a sequel, so...

09:35.400 --> 09:38.720
I loved my house, with my big bonfire in the middle of my house.

09:38.720 --> 09:41.360
Oh yeah, I loved your shrine to fire that you had in your house, it was awesome.

09:41.360 --> 09:45.120
And I had taiko drums in my house.

09:45.120 --> 09:48.800
Animal Crossing was such a great game, I would still be playing it if there was just a little

09:48.800 --> 09:49.800
more to do.

09:49.800 --> 09:53.600
I hope they bring out a really expansive version of it later on.

09:53.600 --> 09:58.240
For any of those companies out there, I'm willing to advertise in my town for your products.

09:58.240 --> 09:59.240
Shut up.

09:59.240 --> 10:10.560
I actually, I have a Dobutsu no Mori, Japanese Animal Forest, which I actually bought to

10:10.560 --> 10:15.900
to help myself with my Japanese because it's all in hiragana katakana.

10:15.900 --> 10:19.200
The kanji that's in there is like first grade level kanji.

10:19.200 --> 10:24.640
It's nothing hard and the thing is I don't know if anyone's ever listened to when they

10:24.640 --> 10:28.360
speak in the U.S. when they're actually saying every letter in the words that they're speaking.

10:28.360 --> 10:31.160
Well, in the Japanese one, now they do say it very fast.

10:31.160 --> 10:34.280
It's hard to catch it, but they're saying every syllable.

10:34.280 --> 10:38.320
They're actually speaking Japanese when they talk to you.

10:38.320 --> 10:39.320
is very fast.

10:39.320 --> 10:40.320
It's just very fast.

10:40.320 --> 10:41.320
And cartoony style.

10:41.320 --> 10:42.320
Exactly.

10:42.320 --> 10:45.920
However, if you listen carefully enough, you can actually hear them talking.

10:45.920 --> 10:46.920
Slow it down.

10:46.920 --> 10:47.920
Record it.

10:47.920 --> 10:48.920
Slow it down.

10:48.920 --> 10:49.920
Mm-hmm.

10:49.920 --> 10:50.920
All right.

10:50.920 --> 10:51.920
Anything else you've been playing this week, Logie?

10:51.920 --> 10:52.920
Nope.

10:52.920 --> 10:53.920
All right.

10:53.920 --> 10:54.920
My week.

10:54.920 --> 10:55.920
A few games I want to talk about.

10:55.920 --> 10:56.920
I want to follow up on Lost in Blue.

10:56.920 --> 10:59.900
It was something that I kind of touched on last week, but I didn't really get to give

10:59.900 --> 11:03.720
a more in-depth impression of it because I feel like I didn't get to play enough of

11:03.720 --> 11:04.720
it.

11:04.720 --> 11:05.720
So I played a little more Lost in Blue.

11:05.720 --> 11:08.360
Sorry to say it didn't really hold my interest.

11:08.360 --> 11:11.880
I would have to say borderline not recommend Lost in Blue.

11:11.880 --> 11:15.200
I think there is an audience for this game out there.

11:15.200 --> 11:19.760
It really reminds me of an old school like computer point and click game like an old

11:19.760 --> 11:26.880
school King's Quest Loom style game and there's definitely some creative things to be done

11:26.880 --> 11:31.320
with the stylus like digging in the sand and starting the fire and some of the things you

11:31.320 --> 11:39.040
do, but I was just really bored with the story, and it seemed like I got so close to dying,

11:39.040 --> 11:40.040
what?

11:40.040 --> 11:44.120
I didn't get that far to the milk and the goat part, no.

11:44.120 --> 11:48.960
I heard it was almost impossible to milk the goat.

11:48.960 --> 11:52.800
The game, honestly, I didn't really want to play it that much longer, it just really didn't

11:52.800 --> 11:57.720
hold my interest, so I can't really recommend Lost in Blue, but I do think there are people

11:57.720 --> 12:01.960
out there that would like this type of game, so I'm not going to completely say avoid it,

12:01.960 --> 12:06.120
but I'm just going to say borderline non-recommend, because I think there are people out there

12:06.120 --> 12:09.040
that might enjoy it. If you like those old-style computer point-and-click games, you actually

12:09.040 --> 12:13.240
might get a kick out of this. You might like this more than I did. And I did like some

12:13.240 --> 12:16.560
King's Quest games and some of that stuff, I just wasn't, like, really into it, so that's

12:16.560 --> 12:17.560
why I came.

12:17.560 --> 12:19.720
Yeah, King's Quest bored the tears out of me, but I love Loom.

12:19.720 --> 12:23.140
See, I love King's Quest IV, like that is an awesome game and some of the other King's

12:23.140 --> 12:26.000
Quest. In fact, I have a King's Quest related story for later, but we'll talk about that

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
in a minute.

12:27.000 --> 12:32.200
The other game I played, based on a recommendation in the forums, I didn't even know this game

12:32.200 --> 12:42.200
was out, but Tecmo Arcade Collection, it's a bunch of old Tecmo arcade games packaged

12:42.200 --> 12:46.440
on one, I think it's only for Xbox, Xbox DVD.

12:46.440 --> 12:50.640
What is great about this is that it supports widescreen televisions, so if you want to

12:50.640 --> 12:54.240
play Tecmobile, it actually shows in widescreen on your TV.

12:54.240 --> 12:55.800
I think that's pretty awesome.

12:55.800 --> 12:58.800
Of course, you know, you could play it on a normal TV as well, it's just going to be

12:58.800 --> 13:02.360
a little bit smaller of an image, but Tecmo Bowl in the arcade was much different than

13:02.360 --> 13:06.360
it was on the NES, and I have to say I'm actually a little bit disappointed, it wasn't quite

13:06.360 --> 13:07.360
what I remember.

13:07.360 --> 13:10.640
Like, on the NES it was really cool, but in the arcade it seemed kind of slow and jerky

13:10.640 --> 13:13.800
and just not my kind of game.

13:13.800 --> 13:17.120
And that's kind of how I felt playing a lot of these games in the Tecmo collection, was

13:17.120 --> 13:21.720
like, boy, I just, I remember this game being a lot better.

13:21.720 --> 13:28.340
And granted, you go into a game like Rygar, now Rygar on the NES was completely different

13:28.340 --> 13:29.340
than it was in the arcade.

13:29.340 --> 13:36.380
The arcade was like a side-scroller action-based game where the Nintendo one was borderline

13:36.380 --> 13:37.380
role-playing style.

13:37.380 --> 13:42.420
It was more of a quest and walk-around, more free-roaming type of game.

13:42.420 --> 13:46.480
The arcade one, that's probably one of my more favorite games in the collection, but

13:46.480 --> 13:49.100
still it's kind of like one of those things where I was like, boy, I remember this game

13:49.100 --> 13:54.960
being better when I played it in the 80s and then I do like Solomon's Key and

13:54.960 --> 13:59.300
Pinball Action and some of the titles that they aren't so much hyping in this

13:59.300 --> 14:03.060
they're really like gems hidden in this collection that are very cool like I

14:03.060 --> 14:06.420
like Solomon's Key the arcade version is very cool and some of the other stuff in

14:06.420 --> 14:11.100
there as well here's my biggest problem with with the Tecmo collection it's

14:11.100 --> 14:17.220
$29.99 not $19.99 and I honestly think $29.99 is a little high when you consider

14:17.220 --> 14:21.300
that most of the retro, at least where I paid for it, it was $29.99, and there were other

14:21.300 --> 14:27.160
retro collections sitting right next to it, the Midway one, the Namco one, for $19.99.

14:27.160 --> 14:32.460
And I just, I don't think the price additional is really justified with this, so what if

14:32.460 --> 14:33.460
it has Tecmo Bowl?

14:33.460 --> 14:37.340
I think $19.99 is a more fair price to be charging for this game.

14:37.340 --> 14:42.720
So I'm gonna borderline recommend it just because I think there's some good titles in

14:42.720 --> 14:46.940
here that a lot of folks might remember from the NES but they never got to play the arcade

14:46.940 --> 14:50.000
versions of some of these games, and I think it's worth checking out. There are a lot of

14:50.000 --> 14:56.360
really good gems in this series, but it's nothing to drop everything and go right out

14:56.360 --> 14:58.000
and buy.

14:58.000 --> 15:01.720
Next game I played this week was Sprung for the Nintendo DS, which is actually a game

15:01.720 --> 15:03.760
that has been out for quite some time.

15:03.760 --> 15:04.760
Since launch.

15:04.760 --> 15:08.000
It was one of the launch titles. I finally got around to playing it this week. Sprung

15:08.000 --> 15:15.780
is one of the second worst video game I've ever played on the DS. It is an awful game.

15:15.780 --> 15:18.300
I didn't even find a game inside Sprung.

15:18.300 --> 15:21.420
I understand Sprung is supposed to be like a dating sim.

15:21.420 --> 15:26.860
So basically all you do is you watch this absolutely idiotic story and select the best

15:26.860 --> 15:31.060
answer from a list and once in a while you use an item.

15:31.060 --> 15:34.740
I was so bored with this game, I forced myself to play the game a little bit longer, but

15:34.740 --> 15:37.560
I was just like, this is stupid.

15:37.560 --> 15:40.120
Why is this a game on the DS?

15:40.120 --> 15:43.420
This should be a game that's a flash thing on somebody's website.

15:43.420 --> 15:45.780
I can't believe somebody will waste their money on Sprung.

15:45.780 --> 15:49.620
I definitely do not recommend Avoid Like the Plague Sprung.

15:49.620 --> 15:50.620
It's awful.

15:50.620 --> 15:53.020
It's not even a game.

15:53.020 --> 15:57.300
It's a scenario-based borefest.

15:57.300 --> 16:00.340
Keep in mind that those games are very, very popular in Japan.

16:00.340 --> 16:02.820
Yeah, but they're also better in Japan.

16:02.820 --> 16:04.720
He has Tokimeki Memorial.

16:04.720 --> 16:06.600
You get to see boobs in the Japanese one.

16:06.600 --> 16:08.300
You don't even get that here.

16:08.300 --> 16:12.220
So they did a Tokimeki for girls.

16:12.220 --> 16:15.580
Well, yeah, and in this one you can play as the girl or the guy

16:17.260 --> 16:20.700
But it doesn't matter that both stories suck so there's the girl one

16:20.700 --> 16:24.740
I mean, she actually has to convince the guy to have sex with her cuz I

16:25.300 --> 16:30.860
Honestly, so I don't know if they ever got it on. I just didn't care. I I wanted that game out of my DS

16:30.860 --> 16:35.420
It's that bad and for the record on the only game I've played that's worse than that is ping-pals

16:35.420 --> 16:39.300
chat room sim

16:39.300 --> 16:43.060
yeah would be picked a chat for an additional that's like picked a chat

16:43.060 --> 16:46.140
plus crappy minigames what is that come on

16:46.140 --> 16:49.540
I anyway I last game Castlevania Dawn of Sorrow

16:49.540 --> 16:53.780
finally a really really good game I played this week if you like to the most

16:53.780 --> 16:56.020
recent Castlevania game that they put out on the

16:56.020 --> 16:59.980
the Game Boy Advance we're like collecting the souls and absorbing the

16:59.980 --> 17:00.640
souls

17:00.640 --> 17:03.880
you're gonna like this one because like the exact same freaking thing it's a

17:03.880 --> 17:05.280
a continuation in that story.

17:05.280 --> 17:09.520
And it's an absolute continuation of the story, except they added the magic seal thing, which

17:09.520 --> 17:13.960
is kind of hokey, but they did some other touch screen elements, like certain souls

17:13.960 --> 17:17.740
that you absorb, you use the touch screen as part of it, and that's kind of neat.

17:17.740 --> 17:18.740
And you can play as Alucard.

17:18.740 --> 17:20.360
Ooh, I didn't get that far yet.

17:20.360 --> 17:25.480
I believe, because Dan showed me something on one of the sites, I believe that Alucard

17:25.480 --> 17:27.200
is an unlockable character in that game.

17:27.200 --> 17:28.200
Oh, that's cool.

17:28.200 --> 17:29.200
Oh, I hope so.

17:29.200 --> 17:32.920
Then you meet with the other people and you can switch off like in Castlevania III.

17:32.920 --> 17:36.480
I say I haven't gotten that far in the game yet, but I do know I like this game, Symphony

17:36.480 --> 17:41.720
of the Night, one of the greatest video games ever in my opinion, and although I haven't

17:41.720 --> 17:47.000
followed the advanced game so well, I did like this most recent one they had, the Aria

17:47.000 --> 17:52.480
of Sorrow, but I like this, the continuation, it's great, and there's extra features like

17:52.480 --> 17:56.320
a versus and a soul trading thing, it's great.

17:56.320 --> 17:59.280
For Castlevania fans, especially if you're a fan of Symphony of the Night, this one doesn't

17:59.280 --> 18:07.600
disappoint. My only complaints is that the drawing thing is a little bit hokey. That's

18:07.600 --> 18:11.200
about it, honestly. It's a great game. I recommend Castlevania Dawn of Sorrow.

18:11.200 --> 18:16.080
I still love the opinion they need to do a US release of what was the Saturn version

18:16.080 --> 18:19.320
of Symphony of the Night in Japan. Oh, where you could play as Maria, right?

18:19.320 --> 18:24.660
Yeah. That game, the one problem I had with it is that the 3D effects were not as good.

18:24.660 --> 18:30.300
the 2D effects were much better, the sound was infinitely better because as the sound

18:30.300 --> 18:37.380
processor and 2D graphics in the Saturn were far superior to the Playstation, but it had

18:37.380 --> 18:40.500
so much more to offer that I think that that game would sell very well if it comes out

18:40.500 --> 18:41.500
over here.

18:41.500 --> 18:52.300
You know a complaint I heard about Castlevania Dawn of Sorrow, a complaint I heard was you

18:52.300 --> 18:53.580
don't get to use a whip.

18:53.580 --> 18:56.580
Yeah, it's not a Castlevania game if you don't use a whip.

18:56.580 --> 19:01.580
It is a totally a Castlevania game. I don't get that argument.

19:01.580 --> 19:05.580
You do unlock a character who is one of the Belmonts and you do get to use a whip.

19:05.580 --> 19:10.580
So what? You don't get to use a whip. The swords play practically the exact same way. I don't get that.

19:10.580 --> 19:13.580
Wait a second. You need to use a whip in Symphony of the Night.

19:13.580 --> 19:14.580
I know.

19:14.580 --> 19:15.580
Yes you do.

19:15.580 --> 19:17.580
Victor is an unlockable character.

19:17.580 --> 19:19.580
Well still though, that's the same thing though.

19:19.580 --> 19:21.580
It's the Victor story.

19:21.580 --> 19:24.580
The night is the greatest Castlevania game, period.

19:24.580 --> 19:25.580
Ever.

19:25.580 --> 19:28.580
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

19:28.580 --> 19:31.580
Not even Simon's Quest, not even Castlevania 3, not even the original.

19:31.580 --> 19:33.580
Dracula X was infinitely better.

19:33.580 --> 19:36.580
No, I, I, you show me Dracula X, I still think...

19:36.580 --> 19:41.580
Dracula X was the last true Castlevania game.

19:41.580 --> 19:43.580
Possibly. I could see that argument.

19:43.580 --> 19:44.580
The series...

19:44.580 --> 19:47.580
But not the Super Nintendo version, not the Super Nintendo version.

19:47.580 --> 19:57.340
Even that was good, but when you started getting into the whole Metroid-style gameplay, I don't

19:57.340 --> 19:59.340
think there's a comparison.

19:59.340 --> 20:04.300
Anyway, we've got to get into some other actual news going on this week.

20:04.300 --> 20:10.020
As much as I could argue about Castlevania all night long, let's talk about it.

20:10.020 --> 20:11.020
And hi, you're a nerd.

20:11.020 --> 20:12.020
You're listening to it.

20:12.020 --> 20:13.020
Just kidding.

20:13.020 --> 20:16.420
We love our listeners.

20:16.420 --> 20:19.900
Follow-ups to some stories we've talked about previously, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger

20:19.900 --> 20:24.220
here in California where we record our show, he did sign that bill and that's the one that

20:24.220 --> 20:28.780
will ban the sale of violent video games to minors and you could be fined up to a thousand

20:28.780 --> 20:34.100
dollars if you're a retailer violating the law, and this takes effect January 1st.

20:34.100 --> 20:37.740
So kids, you better put those violent video games on your Christmas list, because starting

20:37.740 --> 20:43.900
January 1 you won't be able to buy them yourself, or your retailer might get a fine.

20:43.900 --> 20:47.060
Thank God I did not vote for him.

20:47.060 --> 20:49.300
Without getting too political here though, I mean...

20:49.300 --> 20:50.300
I'm just saying.

20:50.300 --> 20:51.300
I know, but...

20:51.300 --> 20:52.300
It's a govenator.

20:52.300 --> 20:58.100
I don't know I mean honestly I could say I didn't vote for him either but this

20:58.100 --> 21:02.420
really was written by a Democratic assemblyman it's really a bipartisan

21:02.420 --> 21:07.140
thing I just think there's I don't think everything was truly being considered

21:07.140 --> 21:10.460
with this I just I just think there could have been a better option to do

21:10.460 --> 21:14.320
what they wanted to do I I'm cool with them I don't know how much I want to

21:14.320 --> 21:18.460
rehash the same topic though honestly just go listen to an old podcast I know

21:18.460 --> 21:24.620
I've talked about it before I just have a quick description for getting more

21:24.620 --> 21:30.780
voters but that could be said of either either party in this case because the

21:30.780 --> 21:35.740
media kind of taking the popular opinion and using media hype to gain himself

21:35.740 --> 21:43.740
some more voters who knows alright GameStop and EB Games the merger was

21:43.740 --> 21:48.420
approved we talked previously that you know GameStop was gonna buy EB Games it

21:48.420 --> 21:53.260
It was approved, the merger went through, and I don't know if the names are changing

21:53.260 --> 21:54.260
though.

21:54.260 --> 21:55.260
I don't think they are.

21:55.260 --> 21:56.260
But they are officially one company.

21:56.260 --> 21:59.700
They'll be just game games.

21:59.700 --> 22:01.140
Now on to some other stories.

22:01.140 --> 22:13.340
The Gizmondo is on its way out on October 22, and there's something special though about

22:13.340 --> 22:14.340
the Gizmondo.

22:14.340 --> 22:15.340
Right, Jamie?

22:15.340 --> 22:16.340
They kind of changed something.

22:16.340 --> 22:18.340
Well, yeah, it's going to be widescreen.

22:18.340 --> 22:20.500
We have a widescreen Gizmondo.

22:20.500 --> 22:21.500
So why are they doing that?

22:21.500 --> 22:22.500
It looks like the PSP.

22:22.500 --> 22:24.380
I think it's funny.

22:24.380 --> 22:33.300
I like the phrase, though, that the rumors that Gizmondo is $210 million in the hole

22:33.300 --> 22:35.500
isn't going to stop the release on time.

22:35.500 --> 22:37.660
I'm sure the Phantom console is worse in the hole.

22:37.660 --> 22:38.660
Yeah.

22:38.660 --> 22:41.780
The only reason it's widescreen is they're trying to compete with the pop station.

22:41.780 --> 22:42.780
Sure.

22:42.780 --> 22:52.200
But taking a look at the image of the widescreen gizmondo, I have to say, I liked the gizmondo.

22:52.200 --> 22:54.640
I had absolutely no problem with it.

22:54.640 --> 22:56.200
This thing does look pretty sleek.

22:56.200 --> 22:58.760
Yeah, but does it have sight talking?

22:58.760 --> 23:02.400
Oh, they definitely changed the look of that from what they were showing at E3.

23:02.400 --> 23:09.720
You know what's funny is I remember the original shots of the PSP back when it was conceptual

23:09.720 --> 23:10.720
still.

23:10.720 --> 23:12.240
They had shots of fish as well.

23:12.240 --> 23:15.800
I think that's kind of ironic in that picture of the widescreen gizmondo, there's fish on

23:15.800 --> 23:16.800
it.

23:16.800 --> 23:18.420
Maybe they took that as a favorable sign.

23:18.420 --> 23:20.440
Are you going to be picking one of these up, Dark Star Crown?

23:20.440 --> 23:21.440
I hope so.

23:21.440 --> 23:28.000
I mean, ever since I got to play it at E3 and played that game, Johnny Whatever, that

23:28.000 --> 23:30.540
had the karaoke mode, was sort of like Guitar Freaks.

23:30.540 --> 23:31.540
What other games are on this thing?

23:31.540 --> 23:33.760
That's the only one I really know anything about, is the Johnny Whatever.

23:33.760 --> 23:34.760
I have no idea.

23:34.760 --> 23:35.760
See?

23:35.760 --> 23:36.760
And what's the golden rule of gaming?

23:36.760 --> 23:38.400
We brought this up on the three hour show this week.

23:38.400 --> 23:41.320
A system is only as good as the games that are on it.

23:41.320 --> 23:44.320
So I want to hear less about the Gizmondo and more about the games.

23:44.320 --> 23:48.060
So start putting out the game information in your press releases, because I'm really

23:48.060 --> 23:49.060
curious.

23:49.060 --> 23:50.060
However, it's Tiger.

23:50.060 --> 23:51.060
Tiger Toys.

23:51.060 --> 23:52.060
Oh yeah, but you know.

23:52.060 --> 23:55.480
They bought us hours of black and white entertainment back in the day.

23:55.480 --> 23:56.480
Very true.

23:56.480 --> 24:00.280
You get those Tiger Toys and you're about to crack a jacks.

24:00.280 --> 24:01.280
Yep.

24:01.280 --> 24:02.280
Very true.

24:02.280 --> 24:04.600
Um, Loki, what's kind of going on in the hack and crack scene?

24:04.600 --> 24:08.360
I know there was, of course, the mandatory PSP update that happened.

24:08.360 --> 24:09.360
Yes, 2.01.

24:09.360 --> 24:13.600
It adds no features whatsoever other than fixing the hole that allows you to do stuff

24:13.600 --> 24:16.000
with your PSP.

24:16.000 --> 24:22.080
Other than that, since people love the hack of the firmware, they're doing some more cosmetic

24:22.080 --> 24:23.080
modifications.

24:23.080 --> 24:28.200
The first one is they have a guide to removing the broken icons.

24:28.200 --> 24:33.920
It requires you to hex edit your firmware and the run of programming basically just

24:33.920 --> 24:38.280
blanks out those icons instead of actually having them pop up.

24:38.280 --> 24:41.840
The other one is, you know those little wavy lines that are on there that prevent burn

24:41.840 --> 24:42.840
in?

24:42.840 --> 24:44.880
You can get rid of those too as well.

24:44.880 --> 24:46.160
Just more cosmetic stuff.

24:46.160 --> 24:47.400
I like the wavy lines.

24:47.400 --> 24:50.960
I know, but some people don't and you know what?

24:50.960 --> 24:55.920
They just want to remove them, so by golly, they're going to do it.

24:55.920 --> 24:56.920
So yeah.

24:56.920 --> 25:01.000
We were talking earlier in the show a little bit about Nintendogs and I was saying that

25:01.000 --> 25:04.560
I get a little burned out on Nintendogs, but the fun is just beginning for some of our

25:04.560 --> 25:06.440
other friends, right Jamie?

25:06.440 --> 25:07.440
Yep.

25:07.440 --> 25:14.960
The seventh nintendo dogs was just released in europe and uh...

25:14.960 --> 25:17.480
loki didn't you post some photos from that in your blog?

25:17.480 --> 25:23.160
it was freaking cute is what it was yes they had um some pictures of the people bringing

25:23.160 --> 25:29.720
their dogs with them um it was just absolutely adorable um they've got one where the dogs

25:29.720 --> 25:37.320
like actually sniffing the, the, or licking the, um, oh my god, dog licking the D.S. Eh?

25:37.320 --> 25:42.040
Eh? He's trying to be a celebrity. DarkSakura, any word on how this game is selling? Over

25:42.040 --> 25:45.560
in Europe? Um, taking a look, oh, there's just your cute picture of the puppy and his

25:45.560 --> 25:53.600
darker ball. I'm sorry, I love that game so much. Um, it got an 8 out of 10 by Eurogamer.

25:53.600 --> 25:59.000
Mm-hmm. Um, really most of the problems, the same problems I had with it was, uh, getting

25:59.000 --> 26:04.820
them to actually understanding what you're saying, but I haven't seen much as far as

26:04.820 --> 26:05.820
the sales on it go.

26:05.820 --> 26:08.880
I haven't yet pulled up the numbers, I've just been pulling up the reviews.

26:08.880 --> 26:15.360
There was a fun line I like in this one review I read on Eurogamer, just to read the small

26:15.360 --> 26:16.360
paragraph.

26:16.360 --> 26:17.360
Sure.

26:17.360 --> 26:20.380
It says, while we're enchanted by it, since it's a highly engaging and entertaining game

26:20.380 --> 26:24.560
and one that makes excellent use of the DS's unique capabilities, plus it's got puppies

26:24.560 --> 26:25.560
in it.

26:25.560 --> 26:27.440
I think that sums it up.

26:27.440 --> 26:33.920
By the way, they did throw a puppy party to celebrate the launch of this game, which featured

26:33.920 --> 26:42.760
such wonderful events as dog-loving celebrities, they had actual canine celebrities as well,

26:42.760 --> 26:45.400
some dogs from different shows and stuff.

26:45.400 --> 26:52.940
They had dog's eye video screens, a very important pooch chill-out area, and the Doggie Olympics

26:52.940 --> 26:58.820
as well as a doggie disco.

26:58.820 --> 27:02.460
Because Nintendogs is so big, there are other people out there that want to steal some of

27:02.460 --> 27:03.460
Nintendogs thunder, correct?

27:03.460 --> 27:04.460
Yeah, there are.

27:04.460 --> 27:14.040
I'm also trying to find the numbers, by the way, but yeah, O3 has decided to put out one

27:14.040 --> 27:22.580
for the GBA called Pocket Dogs, which is basically the same thing on the GBA.

27:22.580 --> 27:26.820
So how would you do that on the GBA with no voice and no touch screens, you can't really

27:26.820 --> 27:27.820
text your dog?

27:27.820 --> 27:31.360
It's actually from the Hanadekka Club toy brand.

27:31.360 --> 27:33.020
Is there screenshots up there on your screen there?

27:33.020 --> 27:40.040
Yeah, Hanadekka Club is sort of like the dog with the fisheye camera, so it's all the puppies

27:40.040 --> 27:41.040
done the same way.

27:41.040 --> 27:46.560
There are eight breeds to choose from, including Pugs, Chihuahua, Shih Tzu.

27:46.560 --> 27:50.200
The dogs can talk with their owners, find out about their likes and dislikes, and will

27:50.200 --> 27:53.620
play games of fetch, frisbee, balls, and bones.

27:53.620 --> 27:57.500
I'm sure that it's crap compared to the other one.

27:57.500 --> 28:01.220
I don't know because I do like the Hanadeka stuff.

28:01.220 --> 28:14.300
I'd look at it, but this actually is, so far it looks like it will be released this holiday

28:14.300 --> 28:15.300
season.

28:15.300 --> 28:16.300
Alright.

28:16.300 --> 28:20.060
Moving on, there's some other stuff coming out for the DS.

28:20.060 --> 28:25.760
I thought this was very interesting, Square Enix is actually putting out a game called

28:25.760 --> 28:30.760
Mario Basket 3 vs. 3, so shock at something that's not a role-playing game, although it's

28:30.760 --> 28:33.640
not the first time they haven't done a role-playing game, but very interesting, they're kind of

28:33.640 --> 28:39.100
doing this little basketball-looking game, and it's a 3-on-3 game using the DS, it should

28:39.100 --> 28:43.340
be interesting, it has a very Mario Kart-style look to it, which I think is very interesting

28:43.340 --> 28:46.580
considering it's being developed not by Nintendo, but by Square.

28:46.580 --> 28:49.140
We did get Mario Baseball.

28:49.140 --> 28:50.140
That's true.

28:50.140 --> 28:51.140
That's true.

28:51.140 --> 28:52.140
That just recently came out.

28:52.140 --> 28:56.380
Also, Nintendo is unveiling a new Wario Land game that's coming out very soon and that

28:56.380 --> 29:00.300
will also be on the DS, so it should be interesting.

29:00.300 --> 29:01.980
I want to mention this for PSP.

29:01.980 --> 29:09.380
Our friends on the PSP, Datel has released a four gigabyte hard drive for the PSP.

29:09.380 --> 29:14.140
Now because this is a hard drive, it also has a battery that goes with it and it's supposed

29:14.140 --> 29:18.580
to boost your time that you play or like it's supposed to like boost the loading times as

29:18.580 --> 29:19.580
as well, using the hard drive.

29:19.580 --> 29:24.700
Well, it's twice the battery power for one, because it's basically this giant battery

29:24.700 --> 29:26.420
that sticks out of your battery port there.

29:26.420 --> 29:27.420
Right.

29:27.420 --> 29:29.740
Then it's also got a 4GB drive in there as well.

29:29.740 --> 29:36.880
Now the only bad thing about Datel is they've got really bad track record with their batteries.

29:36.880 --> 29:38.580
Their batteries tend to explode.

29:38.580 --> 29:39.820
Oh my gosh!

29:39.820 --> 29:46.380
So hopefully this won't have the explosive feature in it, but hey, more storage space

29:46.380 --> 29:48.980
Price is always good, just expensive.

29:48.980 --> 29:53.340
And speaking of which, no price released yet for this.

29:53.340 --> 29:55.580
Actually there is a price released for that.

29:55.580 --> 29:56.580
Oh, I hadn't read it.

29:56.580 --> 30:03.260
The price is going to be actually, I believe it was roughly, they had the European price

30:03.260 --> 30:08.920
for it, which was I think the range of, I can't remember how many pounds, but it ended

30:08.920 --> 30:10.580
up being about $250 US.

30:10.580 --> 30:13.340
Wow, that's almost as much as the PSP.

30:13.340 --> 30:19.020
Yeah, well, it's ridiculous, actually, but if you want to store tons of crap...

30:19.020 --> 30:23.940
Especially since you can't buy actual 4GB hard drives anyway anymore, and if you could,

30:23.940 --> 30:25.940
they'd be like $15.

30:25.940 --> 30:33.500
Well, they're releasing that one peripheral that the team executor is working on that's

30:33.500 --> 30:40.780
actually going to be using CompactFlash and micro drives, which go up to 6GB, and those

30:40.780 --> 30:45.680
Those are a little bit less expensive, but actually, if you get that on there, and then

30:45.680 --> 30:51.420
you add the, there's an adapter you can make or buy that converts laptop drives to work

30:51.420 --> 30:56.300
with Combat Flash, you can, in a sense, have, you know, a 30 gig, 120 gig drive.

30:56.300 --> 31:02.120
Of course, you'd be spending upwards of about $500 for it, but, you know, hey, if you want

31:02.120 --> 31:06.080
more space, I mean, that's one way to do it.

31:06.080 --> 31:07.080
And let's see.

31:07.080 --> 31:13.400
All right, I'm looking to see here real quick because I know they had that going for it.

31:13.400 --> 31:21.400
They also had actually the PSP TV stuff, they announced the price point for that as well.

31:21.400 --> 31:22.400
Oh, what was that?

31:22.400 --> 31:24.120
Do you know the price for that?

31:24.120 --> 31:26.000
Price for that is going to be $119.

31:26.000 --> 31:27.280
They're taking pre-orders right now.

31:27.280 --> 31:31.480
One of the things that they added to it is an S-video out, so you can have that plus

31:31.480 --> 31:32.480
the swappable.

31:32.480 --> 31:36.320
You can do 4.3 or 16.9 aspect ratios.

31:36.320 --> 31:42.200
Speaking of money, but going to a different company, is rumors going around this week,

31:42.200 --> 31:50.400
and I think some of it comes back to Joystiq.com, ran an article about Nintendo possibly releasing

31:50.400 --> 31:58.120
the revolution for $99, kind of a rumor that's going around right now, wouldn't that be very

31:58.120 --> 32:04.660
interesting though, because the Xbox 360 is going to be what, $300 for the core, $400

32:04.660 --> 32:09.140
a little more PlayStation 3 we don't know yet but we can expect it will

32:09.140 --> 32:13.900
probably be about the same so what a way for Nintendo to catch up by being kind

32:13.900 --> 32:18.500
of last one out the gate to really you know create interest in their system

32:18.500 --> 32:22.100
because it would only be $100 can you imagine it would be very smart I'd have

32:22.100 --> 32:26.820
to the only thing I can think of logically is if the system is not that

32:26.820 --> 32:32.940
expensive to make for parts and labor mm-hmm and however much they would pay

32:32.940 --> 32:38.700
per system for marketing and then for you know shipping sales you'd have to

32:38.700 --> 32:44.780
see what what their overhead is in this however you can make enough product with

32:44.780 --> 32:50.340
even a minute profit to make back and pull a good profit by selling more units

32:50.340 --> 32:53.740
you know what's interesting is I seem to remember that Nintendo has tried to

32:53.740 --> 32:58.180
launch new systems at $99 before and usually doesn't make it they usually get

32:58.180 --> 33:02.580
launched for about 150 I'm thinking the GameCube here GameCube and I think

33:02.580 --> 33:06.020
Nintendo 64 was almost the same way as well when it first came out. I can't remember

33:06.020 --> 33:07.980
100 percent. It might have been 200, but

33:07.980 --> 33:10.900
I know both of those they were aiming for $99, so I would expect that the

33:10.900 --> 33:13.260
revolution is probably going to be about $150

33:13.260 --> 33:17.420
if this is really true. Even so, it's comparable. Even so, that's half.

33:17.420 --> 33:19.580
Very competitive. That's half as much.

33:19.580 --> 33:22.780
That would be a real way for Nintendo to gain some ground if they were going to be the

33:22.780 --> 33:24.220
last ones out the gate, but

33:24.220 --> 33:28.500
you know, who knows? There's the whole innovation thing with the controller.

33:28.500 --> 33:32.020
But on top of that, Nintendo has always been oriented toward more family,

33:32.020 --> 33:40.980
child games, and what parent is going to want to buy their small child a $350 system, when

33:40.980 --> 33:45.860
they can get a $150 system that would be easier to play, should their child track it?

33:45.860 --> 33:46.860
Absolutely.

33:46.860 --> 33:47.860
I have something to add here.

33:47.860 --> 33:48.860
Okay.

33:48.860 --> 33:49.860
What?

33:49.860 --> 33:51.740
I don't think we've heard everything about the revolution yet.

33:51.740 --> 33:54.220
I think there's more features they haven't even announced yet.

33:54.220 --> 34:00.340
For example, there was a conference a while back when they were talking about pushing

34:00.340 --> 34:07.340
into the next stage, which is basically 3D, so you're going to have 3D movies and stuff,

34:07.340 --> 34:09.540
like they're going to remake Star Wars and stuff.

34:09.540 --> 34:13.860
One of the presenters there, I believe it might have been Peter Jackson or something,

34:13.860 --> 34:19.220
someone there, Robert Rodriguez, I think it was, mentioned that a lot of film companies

34:19.220 --> 34:26.700
are going to add one game company out there, they're referring to one of the big three,

34:26.700 --> 34:33.700
actually going to be using this in their next console. So, I think that what's going to

34:33.700 --> 34:38.380
be is, and this is my theory, is that they're going to have, it's not going to be as powerful

34:38.380 --> 34:47.380
photorealistic wise, but it's going to be 3D, which will be why you need a 3D remote.

34:47.380 --> 34:50.100
Interesting thought, we'll see.

34:50.100 --> 34:54.200
Loki dropped the name Peter Jackson, of course Peter Jackson's got that King Kong movie coming

34:54.200 --> 34:58.140
out pretty soon. DarkSakura, you said something about the game?

34:58.140 --> 35:05.860
Just a little something on it. I found the trailer for it is actually up on Eurogamer.net.

35:05.860 --> 35:11.600
If you go into their download section, there's the Peter Jackson's King Kong demo available

35:11.600 --> 35:13.720
for download. I think that's probably hitting a lot of the

35:13.720 --> 35:18.240
major game sites because I actually saw a little clip of the game in action. It looks

35:18.240 --> 35:23.560
very nice. If you want to see what the Xbox 360 might look like by using your PC, kind

35:23.560 --> 35:25.880
I know, because the graphics are supposed to be comparable.

35:25.880 --> 35:26.880
Check it out on your PC.

35:26.880 --> 35:30.840
There's also a teaser for Tomb Raider Legends x360.

35:30.840 --> 35:32.640
And teaser would be not playable though, right?

35:32.640 --> 35:33.640
Just a little trailer?

35:33.640 --> 35:37.360
Right, but it is there to see some of the stuff.

35:37.360 --> 35:42.000
Also one I'm kind of interested in myself is the Possession Zombie Takedown.

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
Just because you like zombies, you like to eat brains.

35:44.000 --> 35:45.000
I like the zombies.

35:45.000 --> 35:47.280
I know, but I keep starving in this town.

35:47.280 --> 35:50.600
Alright, DarkSakura.

35:50.600 --> 35:55.780
You know, you have to help save the children of America, basically, because, you know,

35:55.780 --> 36:01.800
they can't be playing the video games all day long, because if they play video games

36:01.800 --> 36:05.420
all day long, then they really will turn into zombies who go around eating brains, and they

36:05.420 --> 36:06.420
can't do it for fun.

36:06.420 --> 36:08.060
MTV does it for us.

36:08.060 --> 36:13.140
So anyway, Dark Sakura's here to save America with her one and only advice column.

36:13.140 --> 36:15.980
Dark Sakura, what are you going to tell the kids about tonight?

36:15.980 --> 36:20.180
Today's piece of advice is how to jump from a moving train, because you never know when

36:20.180 --> 36:24.180
are going to be having a jump from the train, or the Obama from the train.

36:24.180 --> 36:30.180
Number one, make your jump from the end of the rear car.

36:30.180 --> 36:35.180
Obviously, duh. You don't jump from the middle because then, sorry.

36:35.180 --> 36:41.180
Wait for the train to slow as it rounds the bend in the tracks if you have time.

36:41.180 --> 36:47.180
Pick your landing spot, that's number two. The ideal spot is relatively soft and free of obstruction.

36:47.180 --> 36:51.180
3. Get as low to the floor as possible, bending your knees.

36:51.180 --> 36:59.180
4. Jump perpendicular, that's sideways children, to the train, leaping as far as you can.

36:59.180 --> 37:02.180
5. Cover your head with your arms and roll like a log when you land.

37:02.180 --> 37:08.180
6. For my final, final piece of advice, if you hitchhiking, stick to cars.

37:08.180 --> 37:11.180
Much easier. You don't have to jump from a train.

37:11.180 --> 37:14.180
Alright, looking for that piece of advice.

37:14.180 --> 37:21.040
Loki what's going on with the Xbox 360 and some I know you like to talk about homebrew stuff for

37:21.740 --> 37:26.600
PSP but now it sounds like there's independent stuff going on for the 360. What's this about?

37:26.600 --> 37:32.660
Yeah, one of the things that the 360 is gonna have is the Xbox Live Arcade where you can download mini games

37:32.920 --> 37:35.560
Probably not free, but you can download them

37:36.240 --> 37:38.940
Some of the mini games that they've been showing off actually

37:38.940 --> 37:42.980
Actually there's been a couple and those are going to be actually at the Independent Games

37:42.980 --> 37:45.900
Conference in Eugene, Oregon.

37:45.900 --> 37:54.460
The first one being Marble Blast Ultra, which looks like a cheap PC ripoff of Marble Madness.

37:54.460 --> 37:56.740
That may not be a bad thing though, Marble Madness is excellent.

37:56.740 --> 38:01.540
It's not a bad thing, I mean it looks okay.

38:01.540 --> 38:05.780
One of the other things that they had this other game, Mutant Swarm, which sort of just

38:05.780 --> 38:12.040
look like another Asteroids-type game. One I'm excited about, Geometry Wars 2, which

38:12.040 --> 38:17.780
is actually going to be bundled with Project Gotham Racing 3, and this game looks friggin'

38:17.780 --> 38:24.180
awesome. It's kind of a combo between Asteroids, Res, and Phantom Vision. Just tons of explosions

38:24.180 --> 38:30.340
on the screen. The other ones that they were showing off, which actually is pretty cool,

38:30.340 --> 38:33.220
is Joust, a classic Atari game.

38:33.220 --> 38:34.220
Right on.

38:34.220 --> 38:37.860
Now they have joust, but do they have burger time?

38:37.860 --> 38:42.740
Sucks! Sucks! Worst system ever!

38:42.740 --> 38:44.460
No, I'm kidding.

38:44.460 --> 38:48.140
One of the things I was going to mention is the Xbox hard drive that they're

38:48.140 --> 38:51.740
coming out with, it does come with some other features.

38:51.740 --> 38:55.980
Yeah, I was looking about this. What's this? Like Hexic or something?

38:55.980 --> 38:59.900
Hexin. No, Hexin's a different game.

38:59.900 --> 39:04.060
Hexic. It's like a Tetris game. It's actually done by the guy who did Tetris.

39:04.060 --> 39:08.500
there's going to be actually videos like the behind the scenes of the Xbox

39:08.500 --> 39:10.980
whatever and then they have like custom soundtrack stuff and

39:10.980 --> 39:14.500
more gamer text. All useless crap by the way.

39:14.500 --> 39:18.180
Well I don't know, the game might be cool. Okay the game might be cool but does it justify

39:18.180 --> 39:20.780
the hundred dollar price tag on a 20 gig hard drive? No, because

39:20.780 --> 39:24.900
you're getting the hard drive and all the HD cables which is really what's

39:24.900 --> 39:28.260
selling me here because I would like to have the right cables. No, I'm talking about buying the hard drive by itself.

39:28.260 --> 39:32.860
$100. But all this crap is getting preloaded on if you buy the

39:32.860 --> 39:36.460
hard drive yeah and that's it's either if you buy it with the system

39:36.460 --> 39:40.740
or by itself that's going to be on there so you get a game which is kinda cool

39:40.740 --> 39:43.460
but you need the hard drive if you're going to play any of these games because you

39:43.460 --> 39:46.180
guys download them to your hard drive. Oh the arcade stuff yeah.

39:46.180 --> 39:49.740
Yeah the other game that they showed was Wick and the Fable of Souls

39:49.740 --> 39:53.460
and I have no idea what that was it just looks like some RPG or

39:53.460 --> 39:57.260
shooter game that has a tree in it so it's got a tree

39:57.260 --> 40:02.460
that's all I know. Good way to sum that up. It's interesting now the other thing

40:02.460 --> 40:07.860
to disappoint fans, unfortunately, at launch. A couple of games have gone buh-bye, and those

40:07.860 --> 40:13.260
would be Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter for all those Tom Clancy fans, and of course Frame

40:13.260 --> 40:15.160
City Killer for all those Namco fans.

40:15.160 --> 40:19.380
So, starting to push back a little bit there.

40:19.380 --> 40:20.380
It's a good Valentine's Day gift.

40:20.380 --> 40:24.560
Nothing says I love you like Tom Clancy, he's an advanced warfighter.

40:24.560 --> 40:30.220
I'm sure. Speaking of Xbox, might as well roll on with Microsoft here. This week we

40:30.220 --> 40:35.780
had Doom 3 Resurrection of Evil come out, not too often on the consoles, I mean it's

40:35.780 --> 40:40.900
happened before, but not too often do you see expansions coming out for games where

40:40.900 --> 40:46.100
you have to already own the first game to play this expansion, and that's what's going

40:46.100 --> 40:47.700
on with the Doom 3 here.

40:47.700 --> 40:48.700
Not quite.

40:48.700 --> 40:49.700
Really?

40:49.700 --> 40:50.700
No, it's its own thing.

40:50.700 --> 40:51.700
Did I misunderstand the article?

40:51.700 --> 40:52.700
Yes.

40:52.700 --> 40:53.700
Oh, crap.

40:53.700 --> 40:56.580
It's actually, the game's re-released, it's like Ninja Gate in black.

40:56.580 --> 40:59.220
It's basically re-released with the PC expansion stuff.

40:59.220 --> 41:03.500
we've got a couple more weapons and uh... more levels

41:03.500 --> 41:06.220
that's not what somebody else told me something else so we go back as it is

41:06.220 --> 41:08.220
maybe the pc version was like that

41:08.220 --> 41:10.540
yes it was no original

41:10.540 --> 41:11.420
well crap

41:11.420 --> 41:13.940
well that's nothing special and just another game coming out now do three

41:13.940 --> 41:14.900
was pretty cool

41:14.900 --> 41:17.440
it's also the price points lower

41:17.440 --> 41:21.020
it's a that's true twenty nine ninety three tramp or you need it can do

41:21.020 --> 41:22.540
was the movie

41:22.540 --> 41:25.180
oh yeah the trailer forget the movie

41:25.180 --> 41:29.020
see it I'm not I want to see it and laugh at it and then watch the rock for

41:29.020 --> 41:35.540
an hour that first-person thing was so hokey I'm sorry if the halo movie if the

41:35.540 --> 41:39.140
halo trailer ends up looking like that I'm just I'm gonna laugh you know I

41:39.140 --> 41:42.820
still have to remind our listeners you know speaking of movies Silent Hill

41:42.820 --> 41:48.260
coming out next year yeah did you did you have something about like a I'm

41:48.260 --> 41:52.620
still trying to find more on it but there is there's a couple more people

41:52.620 --> 41:58.860
listed on IMDB like we can really you know say yeah IMDB but they have a link

41:58.860 --> 42:04.940
to the article to the not an article but a interview with Roger Avery that I had

42:04.940 --> 42:13.940
touched on a few weeks ago I remembered us getting as far as some of the other

42:13.940 --> 42:18.620
actors in there we also have Jodelle Fairland Alice Cridge is that how her

42:18.620 --> 42:25.140
It also goes a little bit more into the behind-the-scenes cast, but it's still Sean Bean.

42:25.140 --> 42:26.140
That's cool.

42:26.140 --> 42:31.780
At this point, we're getting a little late in the show, but that's all right.

42:31.780 --> 42:35.060
It's never too late to open up the old mailbag and see what's going on, what our listeners

42:35.060 --> 42:36.220
have said to us.

42:36.220 --> 42:41.660
Of course, you can email the show by just sending us an email togo at orangelaungeradio.com.

42:41.660 --> 43:10.820
I am going to try to find a way to get this up on our site, hopefully, but it is of one

43:10.820 --> 43:17.820
of the gameboy micro.

43:40.820 --> 43:46.820
Also in response to Sasuke, I wanted to know what the ColecoVision is. I believe we were talking about the ColecoVision.

43:46.820 --> 43:48.820
Yes, the C-O-L-E-C-O Vision.

43:48.820 --> 43:52.820
Coleco also made swimming pools and cabbage patch kits.

43:52.820 --> 43:55.820
I knew about the cabbage patch kits. I didn't know about the swimming pools.

43:55.820 --> 43:57.820
Yep.

43:57.820 --> 44:02.820
You know, a lot of gaming companies make other things. You may not know about, like, Konami and slot machines.

44:02.820 --> 44:03.820
Yeah.

44:03.820 --> 44:06.820
I know there's others, but that's the one that comes to mind because I like to gamble.

44:06.820 --> 44:15.160
Also, Bradley, not to be confused with Arcadian42, also sent me the link to the GameSpot article

44:15.160 --> 44:16.820
about pocket dogs.

44:16.820 --> 44:17.820
Ah, okay.

44:17.820 --> 44:22.060
Do you like it when the listeners try to clue us in a little bit?

44:22.060 --> 44:23.060
No, it's cool.

44:23.060 --> 44:24.140
We like it.

44:24.140 --> 44:25.980
Anyone else?

44:25.980 --> 44:33.580
Actually, I got another email from Rob with two B's.

44:33.580 --> 44:34.580
Okay.

44:34.580 --> 44:39.820
He actually just had a little bit more about the super huge games.

44:39.820 --> 44:43.520
I think I like this one sentence in particular here.

44:43.520 --> 44:48.660
The industry is taking sides, so it's Betamax versus VHS all over again.

44:48.660 --> 44:50.980
Oh, with the HD DVD and Blu-ray?

44:50.980 --> 44:54.460
With the formats, exactly, but that does make perfect sense.

44:54.460 --> 45:01.840
Oh no, it absolutely makes sense, but I really hope before these things get into, we go too

45:01.840 --> 45:05.880
too far with this, like we went with beta, because my family was the unfortunate family

45:05.880 --> 45:06.880
that had the beta machine.

45:06.880 --> 45:07.880
I had both.

45:07.880 --> 45:12.240
The Betamax, you could copy anything off VHS past CopyGuard.

45:12.240 --> 45:16.000
I know, but we couldn't afford both, so we only had the beta machine.

45:16.000 --> 45:19.840
Whoops, we picked the wrong one, so I really don't want to see that happen again.

45:19.840 --> 45:22.880
I hope this gets settled before it gets really out there.

45:22.880 --> 45:26.680
I love the reminder about the Divix machine.

45:26.680 --> 45:27.680
Remember the Divix?

45:27.680 --> 45:29.200
Oh, sure.

45:29.200 --> 45:35.840
So Penny Arcade and their character are the Demiks, I think that's hilarious.

45:35.840 --> 45:42.000
Also about the worst game, see I always said it was UT, but he said it was Firefly Magic

45:42.000 --> 45:44.100
Carpet.

45:44.100 --> 45:48.960
What about Zelda Wand Gamelon?

45:48.960 --> 45:51.280
I don't know, these are pretty rotten ones.

45:51.280 --> 45:55.640
Frickin' play Sprung and tell me you didn't just play the worst game.

45:55.640 --> 45:58.680
Or Ping Pals, pick up either one of those and tell me you just didn't play the worst

45:58.680 --> 46:05.360
game I actually I at least Zelda amused me for a few seconds I don't know now

46:05.360 --> 46:10.560
I'm one of our listeners wrote in Danny and I want to read this email sure

46:10.560 --> 46:18.120
because I 100% freaking agree with it okay okay um I believe I speak for some

46:18.120 --> 46:24.200
people when I say fuck IGN Wow okay just the other day I was trying to read a

46:24.200 --> 46:27.360
gaming article when all of a sudden a random yellow circle covered over the

46:27.360 --> 46:31.640
text I was reading. As it turned out, this was an ad, an ad that had obscured what I

46:31.640 --> 46:37.280
was reading. After realizing what it was, I was instantly irritated. IGN is notorious

46:37.280 --> 46:41.660
for planting obnoxious advertisements everywhere you try to visit, clicking a link, viewing

46:41.660 --> 46:45.860
an image, forced uncontrollable downloading of a video ad when you want to watch something.

46:45.860 --> 46:51.100
To be fair, this is a trend on the Internet as a whole that IGN is buying into, and I'm

46:51.100 --> 46:54.940
sure is not the only gaming site, but of course one of the most prevalent.

46:54.940 --> 46:55.940
I don't get those.

46:55.940 --> 46:56.940
I paid for mine.

46:56.940 --> 47:00.380
Well, you're a corporate whore, anyway.

47:00.380 --> 47:04.100
And there's the other thing on here, and how about disallowing QuickTime media for the

47:04.100 --> 47:05.100
majority of the time?

47:05.100 --> 47:09.780
I am on a Macintosh and Windows Media Player is atrocious to use and watch on a Mac, and

47:09.780 --> 47:11.620
then again, Windows Media Player is just atrocious, period.

47:11.620 --> 47:12.620
That's my opinion.

47:12.620 --> 47:16.620
What I want to bitch about IGN is all their downloads stop halfway.

47:16.620 --> 47:18.620
Yeah, there's that too.

47:18.620 --> 47:24.620
But there's also in here, you'd think with all the advertising IGN puts up that they'd have the bandwidth to allow QuickTime.

47:24.620 --> 47:28.620
I don't know, they have QuickTime for everything. Once you're like an insider...

47:28.620 --> 47:29.620
You have to be a paid member.

47:29.620 --> 47:30.620
You have to pay for it.

47:30.620 --> 47:31.620
Sorry.

47:31.620 --> 47:35.620
But when this bot came out of nowhere and bought the article I wanted to read, it was the last straw.

47:35.620 --> 47:41.620
A few years ago, IGN was limiting how many images you could view per day, and now they're blocking the text you want to read.

47:41.620 --> 47:45.380
I was starting to tolerate IGN a bit recently, but they have officially lost my respect to

47:45.380 --> 47:46.700
them this across the line.

47:46.700 --> 47:51.300
So basically, he's looking for alternatives to IGN's sudden game spot had turned out

47:51.300 --> 47:52.820
very similarly.

47:52.820 --> 47:56.360
I actually greatly enjoy Eurogamer's News.

47:56.360 --> 48:02.840
Even if it's more geared toward the European audience, you get really good reviews, really

48:02.840 --> 48:04.800
good news on things that are coming out.

48:04.800 --> 48:07.240
They have an excellent download section.

48:07.240 --> 48:10.740
There's also 1UP, which I actually mentioned looking at 1UP.com, and they've been good

48:10.740 --> 48:11.740
to us.

48:11.740 --> 48:12.740
OneUp's pretty good.

48:12.740 --> 48:13.740
I like OneUp.

48:13.740 --> 48:16.560
I also like the ones that are just the facts.

48:16.560 --> 48:18.280
There's no pretty picture, just the facts.

48:18.280 --> 48:19.760
I like the media-oriented sites.

48:19.760 --> 48:24.240
Slashdot and Dig, and some of those ones are just the facts.

48:24.240 --> 48:26.240
If you're looking for trailers, gametrailers.com.

48:26.240 --> 48:27.240
Yeah, gametrailers.com.

48:27.240 --> 48:29.880
If you just want movies and you don't got to pay, then it's great.

48:29.880 --> 48:31.600
So there are alternatives out there.

48:31.600 --> 48:34.720
And of course, other independent podcasts.

48:34.720 --> 48:35.720
Exactly.

48:35.720 --> 48:37.680
Support your independent podcaster.

48:37.680 --> 48:38.680
Yes, please do.

48:38.680 --> 48:39.680
All right.

48:39.680 --> 48:41.680
That was a good email. Thank you.

48:41.680 --> 48:44.680
But yeah, I have to say that voiced a great deal.

48:44.680 --> 48:47.680
Oh, also, use Mozilla.

48:47.680 --> 48:50.680
Use Mozilla and there's an extension you can use.

48:50.680 --> 48:55.680
I use this to block Flash, like Adblock.

48:55.680 --> 48:58.680
Search for Adblock Mozilla on Google and you'll find this.

48:58.680 --> 49:05.680
It's a thing that allows you to block, like Mozilla as it is,

49:05.680 --> 49:08.680
you can right click on an image and block it from ever seeing it.

49:08.680 --> 49:12.960
seeing it but adblock takes it like one step further where you can block plugins on the

49:12.960 --> 49:15.680
page and things so you can get rid of those little QuickTime movies and stuff.

49:15.680 --> 49:16.680
It's beautiful.

49:16.680 --> 49:17.680
Love it.

49:17.680 --> 49:19.000
I really like Firefox for that.

49:19.000 --> 49:23.560
You just right click on it and you go to block images from.

49:23.560 --> 49:27.760
I understand the websites are just trying to make their money and that's perfectly fine

49:27.760 --> 49:31.920
but at the same time there's smart ways of doing it and there's annoying ways of doing

49:31.920 --> 49:32.920
it.

49:32.920 --> 49:35.320
Yeah, opening up IGN should not crash my computer.

49:35.320 --> 49:37.320
Amen to that.

49:37.320 --> 49:38.320
Anything else?

49:38.320 --> 49:44.320
We also got another email about Le Play 2-0, and actually I'm so dumb I just closed the email.

49:44.320 --> 49:46.320
I'll try to credit you next week, I'm sorry.

49:46.320 --> 49:53.320
About Le Play 2-0 combines water play with the world of video games featuring flashing lights and sounds.

49:53.320 --> 49:58.320
Directional water jets move characters through traps and mazes.

49:58.320 --> 50:04.320
There's Pokémon, Super Mario Bros., Donkey Kong, and in Canada only SpongeBob SquarePants.

50:04.320 --> 50:10.080
But after looking at this thing though, it looks like those little toys that you used

50:10.080 --> 50:16.160
to get in the 80s that you'd push the button and it shot water up into the thing.

50:16.160 --> 50:19.320
Now this one, it's electronic, you control the direction on it.

50:19.320 --> 50:22.520
This makes me think of those things where you squish the water and try to hit the loop

50:22.520 --> 50:24.640
and put it on a pike or something.

50:24.640 --> 50:25.640
Hmm.

50:25.640 --> 50:26.640
Sounds weird.

50:26.640 --> 50:29.480
I'd have to really see this thing in action, but that's really what it's making me think

50:29.480 --> 50:30.480
of.

50:30.480 --> 50:35.080
I don't know if I want to... I don't feel like getting in the pool to try this out, sorry.

50:35.080 --> 50:38.640
Could you go to play2o.com

50:38.640 --> 50:42.000
Okay. Anything else?

50:42.000 --> 50:46.080
Well, I do, but I think I will let somebody else

50:46.080 --> 50:50.320
talk for a moment. Oh no, go ahead, go ahead. Do you insist? Yeah, I insist.

50:50.320 --> 50:55.040
Must you? I do. I don't have it up, so you got the email up. There was one that

50:55.040 --> 50:55.360
was

50:55.360 --> 50:58.000
did you get me mail to me right

50:58.000 --> 51:01.720
sort of text that we close the email but i was sorry

51:01.720 --> 51:03.880
i can get it up real fast here sorry

51:03.880 --> 51:07.180
you know i'm glad that your room is not in the room when you say that it was

51:07.180 --> 51:09.000
shut up while you guys are doing that

51:09.000 --> 51:13.880
i've heard or i got it it was on line

51:13.880 --> 51:18.600
it was uh... shall amongst it was a gay question from uh... steven s

51:18.600 --> 51:21.620
uh... who by the way has a hilarious email address but of course i can read

51:21.620 --> 51:23.000
it on air but it's hilarious

51:23.000 --> 51:27.080
says in Shaolin Monks I've been playing with my friend and every time he gets a

51:27.080 --> 51:29.480
fatality, brutality, or brutality he gets it

51:29.480 --> 51:32.560
and my character doesn't. If you can help me figure this out it would be much

51:32.560 --> 51:34.640
appreciated because I'm about ready to give up on this game.

51:34.640 --> 51:38.880
Hey, I played Mortal Kombat Shaolin Monks and the fatality thing was really

51:38.880 --> 51:40.160
ticking me off too.

51:40.160 --> 51:44.240
Honestly, you're going to have to check that out on Game FAQ.

51:44.240 --> 51:47.320
Game FAQs, gamefacts.com

51:47.320 --> 51:51.040
because I unfortunately do not know the answer and I'm okay with admitting

51:51.040 --> 51:52.520
that I do not know the answer.

51:52.520 --> 51:55.740
So, um, go for it. Check that out.

51:55.740 --> 51:59.720
Um, and when you find out, let me know, because I want to know why I can't keep...

51:59.720 --> 52:03.960
why I can't unlock any more fatalities in that game. I'm just being stupid or something, I don't know.

52:03.960 --> 52:07.920
Well, I've got a couple more. I have, um, this week's UK releases.

52:07.920 --> 52:11.840
Yeah. And I've touched on a few of them. We have, uh, Brat Angels,

52:11.840 --> 52:15.000
Combat Elite, uh, World War II Paratroopers, Driver 3,

52:15.000 --> 52:18.040
uh, uh, uh, Heart of Rome,

52:18.040 --> 52:21.360
um, Heart of Empire, I'm sorry, Rome, Marvel Nemesis, Rize of the Imperfects,

52:21.360 --> 52:29.360
Namco Museum, Battle Collection, Rengoku Tower, Purgatory, Serious Sam 2, Spy Toy, WRC, Rally Evolution, those are all on the 14th.

52:29.360 --> 52:36.360
On 21st, Buzz the Music Quiz, Cold War, Crash Tag Team Racing, Dragon Ball Z, Budokai, Tenkaichi,

52:36.360 --> 52:43.360
Dual Master Shadow of the Code, Fear, Fable, The Lost Chapters, Genji, LA Rush, Pokemon, Emerald,

52:43.360 --> 52:46.360
and as I scroll down to see if there's anything else...

52:46.360 --> 52:52.360
Oh my God, UFO Aftershock X3 Reunion, those are all coming out next week.

52:52.360 --> 52:53.360
Alright, sounds good.

52:53.360 --> 52:56.200
Alright, we're starting to get kind of laid on the show here.

52:56.200 --> 52:57.200
Yes.

52:57.200 --> 52:58.200
I had one last one.

52:58.200 --> 52:59.200
One last one.

52:59.200 --> 53:00.200
Just a quick one.

53:00.200 --> 53:01.200
Alright, make it quick.

53:01.200 --> 53:04.720
The Australian High Court, to our Australian listeners, hello everybody.

53:04.720 --> 53:06.340
PlayStation mod chips are legal, guys.

53:06.340 --> 53:08.420
You can mod the hell out of your PlayStation.

53:08.420 --> 53:09.480
And it's all legal.

53:09.480 --> 53:14.900
The whole thing behind that is it was their decision found that PlayStation chips's functions

53:14.900 --> 53:19.800
were circumvented by modchips to allow unauthorized games to be played are not primarily copy

53:19.800 --> 53:21.600
protection devices.

53:21.600 --> 53:24.960
They really don't give a rat's ass whatever you play on your system as long as it's not

53:24.960 --> 53:25.960
bootlegged.

53:25.960 --> 53:27.720
Well, have fun down under with your modchips.

53:27.720 --> 53:28.780
Import those games.

53:28.780 --> 53:30.720
Have fun.

53:30.720 --> 53:32.200
Just a few quick stories for you guys here.

53:32.200 --> 53:33.200
We're trying to wind down here.

53:33.200 --> 53:36.260
I do want to say one other thing about the PSP.

53:36.260 --> 53:39.260
There's a virus scanner now available for the PSP.

53:39.260 --> 53:42.920
It's called P-Safe-P 1.1.

53:42.920 --> 53:47.340
And I don't know why, this just kind of amuses me because, you know, now that PSP can actually

53:47.340 --> 53:52.540
be online and stuff, that they have to have these virus scan programs and stuff, it's

53:52.540 --> 53:53.540
amusing.

53:53.540 --> 53:57.420
It comes down to the same thing, don't run programs you don't know where they came from.

53:57.420 --> 54:01.460
Wasn't there a big outbreak of some program that was claimed to be the downgrader was

54:01.460 --> 54:02.460
a big virus?

54:02.460 --> 54:04.940
Well, that was another fake downgrader.

54:04.940 --> 54:08.700
Well, you just got to be careful about what you download.

54:08.700 --> 54:12.100
Now Matt, you had another thing for us regarding some games.

54:12.100 --> 54:21.140
Yeah, real quick, they did a PS3 demonstration recently at the CEA Tech 2005 conference in

54:21.140 --> 54:26.700
Japan to show off the cell processor and one of the things that they were demonstrating

54:26.700 --> 54:31.820
could be the possible evolution in the iToy, which is they actually had a demonstration

54:31.820 --> 54:37.620
where the iToy took a picture of the person and recreated a 3D model of their head, just

54:37.620 --> 54:42.400
like completely accurate and they're just saying that this is possible that

54:42.400 --> 54:46.800
later on something like this could be used in the PS3 to actually put you in

54:46.800 --> 54:47.280
the game

54:47.280 --> 54:50.520
I mean that's freaky okay all right well interesting

54:50.520 --> 54:54.080
anything else? That's all I've got

54:54.080 --> 54:58.120
Well you know they've been trying to do that for years they had that thing with the gameplay camera

54:58.120 --> 55:01.120
what was it in perfect dark wasn't it?

55:01.120 --> 55:04.360
yeah but that was that was yeah and they've done it for

55:04.360 --> 55:08.360
That's just facial skinning. They have that for the iToy now.

55:08.360 --> 55:13.360
But boy, that's just like pasting your face, but the 3D modeling and everything, that's crazy stuff.

55:13.360 --> 55:17.360
Yeah, this is a 3D head. I mean, this is not just some stupid mapping.

55:17.360 --> 55:21.360
I don't want to see how fat I look in a video game, okay? I don't need no 3D model.

55:21.360 --> 55:28.360
I don't know what it is, but what just popped into my head is having the model taken and then like, for a new Rayman game, Raymanizing yourself.

55:28.360 --> 55:30.360
That would be fun.

55:30.360 --> 55:31.360
That'd be weird.

55:31.360 --> 55:33.360
I love manipulation like that.

55:33.360 --> 55:42.280
like that.

55:42.280 --> 55:49.560
You know there was this big fan homebrew thing going on, Kings Quest 9, every cloak has a

55:49.560 --> 55:54.680
silver lining, get this, they had all these volunteer people, like they had a 2000 page

55:54.680 --> 56:00.600
script going for it, 9 chapters, 450 characters, original music, original voice acting being

56:00.600 --> 56:05.960
done for this whole thing, and a cease and desist was just laid on him this week by Vivendi

56:05.960 --> 56:10.300
Universal Games, which, you know, acquired Sierra some time ago, which Sierra made the

56:10.300 --> 56:11.580
King's Quest games.

56:11.580 --> 56:15.740
So this mat got put down on this, which is too bad, because King's Quest is kind of one

56:15.740 --> 56:18.780
of those games where I kind of, I'm always like, I wonder what ever happened to King's

56:18.780 --> 56:22.740
Quest, you know, I knew that there was like that eighth game that didn't really register

56:22.740 --> 56:26.320
on the radar too much, but then King's Quest kind of disappeared, so I would have been

56:26.320 --> 56:30.580
excited to see something like this, a continuation of the story, and what a fan community!

56:30.580 --> 56:34.860
Honestly, what a community to be getting that many people involved in a project like that.

56:34.860 --> 56:35.860
That's great.

56:35.860 --> 56:39.140
But unfortunately, I guess when you get that many people involved, you start to draw attention

56:39.140 --> 56:40.140
to yourself.

56:40.140 --> 56:42.100
So that's too bad, I guess.

56:42.100 --> 56:46.700
Maybe they'll release it as like, Queen's Trip.

56:46.700 --> 56:48.700
There's an idea.

56:48.700 --> 56:51.100
Queen's Journey, Part 9.

56:51.100 --> 56:52.100
Peasants Quest.

56:52.100 --> 56:53.100
Yeah, yeah.

56:53.100 --> 56:54.900
Curse you, Choctaw!

56:54.900 --> 56:59.760
Or, you know, maybe they could work out a deal where maybe Vivendi Universal could just

56:59.760 --> 57:06.760
distribute this game and, you know, make some money, download it free off of their website.

57:06.760 --> 57:09.880
Seriously, I mean, come on, some people still love King's Quest.

57:09.880 --> 57:13.840
All right, last story, you guys, ready?

57:13.840 --> 57:22.200
This is a brand new game coming out, I don't know how else to say this, Care Bears Catch

57:22.200 --> 57:27.560
a Star is now coming out for the PC and Macintosh.

57:27.560 --> 57:31.860
Of course, this is coming out right before the Care Bears Big Wish movie, which is coming

57:31.860 --> 57:38.280
out on DVD October 8th, or I'm sorry, that actually would have already come out here.

57:38.280 --> 57:42.760
So that is the Care Bears of the 80s, brand new game.

57:42.760 --> 57:46.020
Although they haven't changed how they look like they did with Strawberry Shortcake.

57:46.020 --> 57:49.400
My big wish is that they would just stay in the 80s.

57:49.400 --> 57:52.360
You need the Care Bears stare, don't you?

57:52.360 --> 57:54.200
Loki just needs a Care Bears stare.

57:54.200 --> 57:57.240
I just don't care at all.

57:57.240 --> 58:00.680
I still remember the Care Bears and Wonderland movie, and that was awesome.

58:00.680 --> 58:04.080
Hey, it's only 20 bucks! Can't argue with that?

58:04.080 --> 58:08.460
Ooh! That's the end of the show. Final thoughts, Loki?

58:08.460 --> 58:12.080
I hate the Care Bears. Final thoughts, Dark Sakura?

58:12.080 --> 58:15.580
Reject Pause Icons and Itchy,

58:15.580 --> 58:21.080
Tasty. My final thought is, somebody's got a case of the Mondays.

58:21.080 --> 58:26.880
Alright, thank you guys so much. If they really take my stapler, I'm going to set the

58:26.880 --> 58:30.680
