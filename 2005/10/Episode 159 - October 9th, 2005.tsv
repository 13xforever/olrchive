222992	232719	Hello everybody, it is October 9th, 2005, you're tuned in to Orange Lounge Radio Live, and we're about ready to kick off tonight's program.
233220	243127	On tonight's program, we're going to be talking a little bit about Extreme 2's online mode, because I got a chance to play that this week, and we're also going to be talking a little bit about Tycho Drummaster, because...
243767	250150	Xtifer picked that up this week and he's like obsessed with Taiko Drum Master all of a sudden so we definitely have to talk to him about that and his movie review.
250611	255453	All that and all the other crap you're used to here on this lovely program known as Orange Lounge Radio.
255493	256093	See you after this.
269228	272370	Orange Lounge Radio is presented in the TMI sound format.
302871	305614	You're listening to Orange Line Radio Live.
305634	309117	This mommy talk radio is so much more.
309257	310098	Oh, God.

334699	341143	Orange Lounge may contain plenty of... Just kidding.
341243	344966	Orange Lounge Radio will not contain any of that in this episode.
345266	346907	Well, isn't that special?
351457	369904	Orange Lounge Radio Live is a fully interactive program via our website at www.orangeloungeradio.com And now, here are your hosts for Orange Lounge Radio Live, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.
371836	380764	We are live, and this is episode number 159 for this October the 9th of 2005.
380984	386449	You're tuned in to Orange Lounge Radio, radio that gamers really want, and this...
386909	387149	DarkSakura
411874	413595	Yeah, I'm actually not sure where she's at.
413635	419036	I know she said something about homework was probably going to delay her a little bit, but we'll see what's going on.
419096	423097	I'm sure she's going to run through the door any minute now going, ah, traffic, or the line at Safeway or something.
423117	423898	So she'll be here any minute.
424538	426418	But we're here with us.
426858	429959	And by the way, when DarkSakura does get here, everybody, fired!
431220	431600	Just kidding.
432240	432960	I could never fire her.
433100	433660	She'd kick my ass.
434621	436521	Right here is the one and only Loki.
436541	437181	Hello.
437742	438302	How you doing, Loki?
439502	444264	Good, except I'm good in the department of developing pictures.
445004	447245	We'll talk about this later, because I want to talk about how stupid that thing is.
447306	448506	So we'll talk about that in a little bit.
448526	451007	I noticed Loki is sporting his In the Courtroom shirt today.
451107	451347	Yes.
451848	456410	So those of you guys that won prizes a couple weeks ago, we finally got the In the Courtroom shirts.
456710	458130	So our grand prize winner, who won that?
458150	460171	Justin and Icy, I think, won the haiku thing.
460311	460491	Yeah.
460571	463633	We're going to be sending the In the Courtroom shirt along with the In the Groove game this week.
464193	475044	And I'll tell you what, I can't say anything about something that's in the works right now, but I'll be damned if this isn't the best week for us to be doing this.
476005	477507	Save it for next week, because it's going to be great.
477707	478548	That's all I can say.
479229	479569	Yeah, I know.
480230	484754	Anyway, we're here though, and we're going to be talking about all sorts of other stuff.
485315	487377	Bugged is also here tonight, one of our guests.
488789	489049	Howdy.
489469	489950	How you doing?
490470	491390	Hi, I have a PSP.
492511	493452	And fuck traffic, apparently.
493652	494072	I knew it.
494432	494952	What did I say?
494992	498835	I said she'd walk in here and she'd go, fuck traffic or fuck the line at Safeway.
499235	499715	One of the two.
501496	502497	Hi, DarkSakura, how are you?
503857	504318	That's your butt.
506719	507079	Next.
507940	508260	Alright.
510097	513441	So we're here and we're about ready to get started with tonight's show.
513782	516886	Extifer is out in the front room playing Taiko Drum Master.
517246	517707	My fault.
517827	518668	Yeah, your fault.
518728	520370	I'll be talking to you about that later.
521533	522174	We'll get into that.
522794	524375	Meanwhile, though, let's get tonight's show started.
524435	525256	Get your butt in the chatroom.
525276	525836	WarrenTalentRadio.com.
525856	526617	We're going to come back.
526637	535464	We're going to talk a little bit about some things going on in the Bomani scene, although it's kind of a slow news week because everybody's playing Dance Dance Revolution Extreme 2.
536124	539247	I want to talk about online mode a little bit, though, because I finally got into online mode today.
539287	540007	It's very interesting.
540328	542790	And I can talk about my gaming router adventures and everything, so it'll be fun.
542810	544111	We're going to have a fun show, kids.
544151	545011	We'll be back after this.
545031	546753	We're going to start it off this break with a song.
547293	554820	That definitely had a lot of people talking last week, and we're going to talk about it a little bit more this week, but we're going to play the original, uncensored version of Injection of Love.
554860	555641	We'll be back after this.
590327	590812	and many more.
666823	667928	Thanks for watching!
698695	700236	Thanks for watching!
807188	808289	and the rest of the crew.
857018	860824	Thanks for watching!
916443	917264	Thanks for watching!
957116	958617	Hey, did you hear about that show?
959097	959678	What show?
959998	965461	Well, they play a lot of great Fermanian video game music, but if you listen to it, you have to listen to it again within seven days.
965862	967143	Oh, I've heard of that station.
967243	967583	Really?
967983	970104	Yeah, I even listened to it a couple weeks ago.
970585	972846	Hey, what happens to you if you don't listen to it again?
973046	974007	Well, you die.
974627	975188	I, what?
975988	980131	Hey, wait, what's this crazy bitch doing coming out of my computer screen?
982274	984801	Orange Lounge Radio Listen or DIE!
988496	992978	Hi, we're back on Orange Lounge Radio, here, episode number 159.
993598	999121	God, every week I say one higher number, and I think, God damn, we've been doing this show a long time.
999521	1001262	We're in, like, what, studio number three?
1002402	1010065	Actually, really it's four, if you think about it, because the show has been done, no, studio number five, because the show has been done at two of DarkSakura's places.
1010346	1012186	Yeah, because I moved once and I moved again.
1012306	1015588	Yeah, so, this show gets around quite a bit, so...
1016206	1016906	We're such a hoe.
1032369	1033409	DarkSakura, what the hell?
1033489	1034069	What did you do?
1034089	1055155	Friday night we had our supposed to be weekly Firefly Marathon, and we went out to do Late Night Lions and came back, and I was actually hunting down the Turbo Duo to play some Dracula X, and instead, Dan's like, put up your free Taiko
1055635	1062417	Drum Master, so I did, and I have an RO pad, I'm not going to say the name.
1064218	1066878	But I also have, of course, the original, because Dan got all that for free for me.
1067599	1071120	And so we played a bunch, like two songs.
1071820	1073560	My hands were bruised by the time I was done.
1073780	1074160	Good deal.
1074841	1076321	And I won the watermelon contest.
1077421	1078722	The watermelon contest?
1078962	1079762	Oh, and the mini game.
1079802	1081262	I haven't really played enough Taiko Dramas.
1081302	1082503	I've played Taiko No Tachigen.
1083206	1084366	But I don't remember that minigame.
1084386	1086727	So are you going to be importing some of the Taiko no Tatsujin?
1086747	1086887	Yeah.
1087367	1091648	I've played like three different Taiko no Tatsujin games thanks to Navi the Pop and Music Whore.
1092348	1093388	He has like all of them.
1093568	1094528	So I've played a bunch of those.
1094548	1095889	I don't remember the watermelon eating game.
1096569	1098029	The intro is cracked out.
1099189	1101730	That is one of the queerest movies I've ever seen.
1101790	1102670	The how to play.
1104130	1105451	The how to play was great.
1105511	1106451	The how to play was like...
1107335	1110336	When the red dot comes, hit the note.
1110736	1111696	Boom, boom, ba-doom.
1112096	1112916	Boom, boom, ba-doom.
1113136	1114356	It's like this little song.
1114396	1115756	I'm talking about the intro, though.
1116177	1117777	The intro is so cracked out.
1118297	1120637	And it made me really have a craving for takoyaki.
1122358	1123318	Takoyaki's yummy.
1123438	1125518	Did it bring out your inner egg?
1125538	1128119	Where you're white on the outside, yellow on the inside?
1130679	1131799	I just want takoyaki.
1131819	1133199	Because takoyaki's yummy.
1134200	1136120	Don't they have takoyaki bell?
1139163	1144407	I still have fake psoriasis.
1144427	1144787	Look at my toe.
1163646	1164546	DarkSakura.com
1180251	1183354	Yeah, because I didn't start itching until I was here doing the show.
1183674	1184875	You're allergic to extifer.
1184895	1185856	That's basically what it is.
1186256	1188838	I'm allergic to gay... Okay.
1188858	1189959	You're allergic to gay people?
1189979	1191260	Is that what you're going to say?
1191280	1191720	Gay people?
1192761	1193922	Are you homophobic, ma'am?
1193962	1196745	I'm allergic to your carpet.
1197265	1199066	Your gay carpet.
1199086	1200608	You and I have something in common, honey.
1201348	1202729	I don't like that either.
1203290	1204391	I don't like carpet either.
1204411	1205912	Yay.
1205972	1206172	Anyway.
1206392	1206873	No, um...
1209073	1211374	No, I can't be allergic to gay because I caught that already.
1211974	1212374	Yeah, yeah.
1212734	1214715	At Spiggle five years ago.
1214835	1216175	How did you catch gay at Spiggle?
1216676	1219596	Because, okay, this is an old story.
1220497	1221217	Do tell.
1222157	1223718	I remember my big Pepsi bong.
1224898	1229381	I got this big bone-shaped Pepsi drink with the long straw.
1229401	1230442	Right, it was this drink.
1230482	1232243	I don't know if they still sell it at Spiegel.
1232303	1232884	I highly doubt it.
1232904	1234085	Spiegel, by the way, Sunnyvale Golf Line.
1234285	1238468	And you had just got done playing an intense game of DDR.
1239108	1240949	So I said, here, do you want something to drink?
1241009	1242230	I don't have any diseases.
1242631	1246914	And you say, okay, and take this big old drink, and I take it back, and I take my drink, and you go, I have gay.
1246934	1249736	I was like, oh my god, suddenly I want Irene.
1249756	1250156	I mean...
1252762	1253222	I remember that.
1253242	1253983	Okay, I remember that now.
1254083	1255444	Yeah, that was an old story.
1256365	1256665	Okay.
1257406	1265412	But it turned out, well, my doctor, after two weeks of all these other treatments and I don't get better, we decide it's not viral.
1265873	1269095	So he puts me on amoxicillin, which I've never reacted to before.
1269115	1271417	I called my mom to make sure before I started taking it.
1271437	1273078	Mom, do you have any reactions to amoxicillin?
1273539	1274640	No, it's just penicillin.
1275040	1278503	And it's in the same family, but some people don't have reactions to one that they do to the other.
1278923	1280164	So I'm like, okay, so I take it.
1280264	1280685	I'm fine.
1280725	1281886	I finish it up last week.
1282506	1286810	And then, Sunday, during the middle of the show, I start itch, itch, itch, itch.
1287290	1288051	I don't think anything of it.
1288071	1290493	Monday, I'm a little itchy, you know, just a little bit itcher.
1290513	1296658	And then I go to spin, which, of course, the worst thing you can do when you are having a rash is to exercise, because you are not supposed to be warm.
1296898	1300141	Spin, by the way, is a class at the gym where you ride a bike a lot.
1300641	1300981	Yeah.
1301302	1301662	Okay.
1302182	1303683	In different and exciting positions.
1303804	1306025	But the bike does not spin around, contrary to popular belief.
1306045	1310229	Before that, I thought it was just, you know, what little kids do where they, you know, get up and spin, kind of...
1310809	1313270	That was the best thing on the playground.
1313550	1319813	You could spin the little merry-go-round, put your friends on it, and then you'd get five people to spin that thing as fast as you can.
1319993	1320954	And launch them into orbit.
1320994	1322474	Launch them into orbit.
1322514	1323895	Everybody gets so dizzy they throw up.
1324075	1324435	You know what?
1324455	1325216	That's still fun.
1326596	1328357	We need to do Orange Lounge Radio live at the park.
1329498	1331178	We need to do one of our podcasts at the park.
1331198	1332919	That would be awesome.
1332939	1333679	On the merry-go-round.
1334280	1339142	As I was saying, Tuesday I have red welts all over my body.
1339895	1341177	I am itching and miserable.
1341918	1342519	Wednesday.
1342980	1345563	I call the doctor in the morning and go ahead and schedule my appointment.
1346404	1349268	And as the day develops, my throat starts closing up.
1349348	1350630	I'm having trouble breathing.
1351552	1353254	I had stomach cramps so bad.
1353274	1355838	You definitely didn't catch gay because your throat wouldn't be closing up.
1359102	1377348	Okay, as I was saying, I went to eat at the deli that I normally do behind my work and as I was walking back, my stomach cramps were so bad that I would have to stop because I could not walk because it hurt to put the pressure on my stomach from, you know, the motion of walking.
1377928	1378888	So I went to the doctor.
1381189	1382089	And this is Drug Chat with Dark Sakura.
1405056	1414623	and then one of my co-workers who has issues with eczema let me use her prescription for this ointment that made the itch go away.
1415604	1417545	You know, I once had an allergic reaction to amoxicillin.
1417565	1419687	It was the first time I was ever on penicillin of any type.
1419707	1422429	I was probably like 12 years old and I don't even remember why I was on amoxicillin.
1422629	1423870	Why do they put people on amoxicillin?
1423910	1425912	Because they have sinus infections or something?
1425932	1427393	It's an antibiotic.
1427433	1427993	I love that stuff.
1428013	1428654	It tastes so good.
1428874	1430215	That is gross.
1430235	1430335	Ew.
1430655	1431716	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1448995	1449795	I don't even know how to say it.
1449815	1450335	You know how bad it was?
1450355	1454736	At the club, I went in and sat on these couches, and it's under a black light.
1455756	1463838	And I'm so very pale that all the places where I was broken out look like big black spots.
1464118	1464638	Oh my God.
1464658	1466898	Because my skin normally glows when I go in the club.
1467018	1468999	To which they went, oh no, she's infected.
1470579	1473420	Someone mentioned that my neck looked like it had a continent on it.
1473640	1474680	Did it say you had the SARS?
1475686	1477007	Yeah, it was SARS.
1477928	1479729	So besides Diseaseful, how was your week?
1481070	1481971	I played lots of games.
1483873	1484173	Like what?
1484713	1486875	I finally opened up my copy of Katamari.
1487435	1489317	Yay, so we can say the K word again.
1489377	1490198	We can say the K word again.
1490278	1490938	Alright, good to hear.
1491939	1500366	And then I played some World of Warcraft and thought about asking Dan to buy me DDR and then I thought no.
1500766	1502988	You know, I realized why I can't ever play World of Warcraft.
1503919	1504079	Why?
1504299	1511282	Because everybody, like a lot of people I know play World of Warcraft and everybody's trying to get me to sign up and go to their server.
1511622	1514783	The problem is that everybody is on a different server.
1515184	1520286	So if I sign up for that game, I'm going to have to pick a server to go to and I'm going to piss people off.
1520446	1521286	No, not necessarily.
1522586	1531930	And extra for having this conversation the other day when I was showing in World of Warcraft, you can have as many characters as you want on as many servers as you want to and not get charged for it.
1531990	1533551	But I don't like the whole...
1533931	1535592	I was in an hour of gameplay, I made level 6.
1535672	1537654	You can't do that on Final Fantasy XI, I'm sorry.
1537674	1538755	Not in an hour of gameplay.
1555908	1559711	Unless you have people freaking tanking for you or something, but by yourself.
1559731	1561553	There's ways, but not when you first play.
1561813	1565636	You can run around and not kill anything and at least go up two levels.
1566727	1567407	On World of Warcraft?
1567547	1568328	On World of Warcraft.
1568908	1571269	You find a lake, you get 50 experience points.
1571309	1573310	You find a town, you get 100 experience points.
1573630	1575871	You meet X person, you get 100 experience points.
1575891	1576811	That's retarded.
1577231	1578112	You finish a quest, you get 50.
1578252	1581933	Actually, it is not for the simple reason it is an RPG.
1582053	1589716	If you do tabletop RPG, if you do live action RPG, you get experience for doing things and participating in the game.
1590216	1593418	Not for just going around doing freaking hack and slash, which I think is ridiculous.
1593858	1595058	You discover you have arms.
1595419	1596319	Two experience.
1597645	1600006	You discovered the secret to love making.
1601146	1602327	You just hit puberty!
1602507	1603287	Ten experience!
1603587	1605148	You growed your first pubes.
1605288	1606108	Five experience.
1606668	1612830	But I like that in the fact that experience is defined by what you do.
1613570	1614731	Not just what you kill.
1615774	1616475	Also, Jamie.
1617175	1617656	Oh, hi.
1617756	1618776	Hello, everybody.
1618796	1620798	Did you take a break from Tycho long enough to say hello?
1620818	1621098	I did.
1621278	1621558	All right.
1621679	1623000	Yo, everyone.
1623520	1624721	Are your hands bruised yet?
1625562	1626702	No, my hands aren't bruised yet.
1627383	1632287	What I was going to tell you to say is what happens when you die on World of Warcraft.
1632447	1634088	Oh, yeah, you have to go back and find your body.
1634729	1635309	You're a ghost.
1635629	1636770	I do remember seeing that, yeah.
1636990	1639132	That's pretty cool, because I haven't died yet, because I'm awesome.
1641964	1642344	DarkSakura.com
1662775	1666841	Got Pizza x4, I think that's a reference to the slash pizza command in EverQuest.
1667322	1669606	You randomly die, 6 experience.
1670247	1671508	You learn what IRC is.
1672609	1673350	Ah, you guys are weird.
1673450	1674130	Alright, um, anything else?
1674531	1683819	Well, if you think about it, though, you know, in real life, you know, the different things you do add to your experience and teach you along the way, and you level over here.
1683839	1686581	Sometimes you de-level when you find things out in real life.
1687082	1687982	Like, ah!
1688022	1689243	This has traumatized me!
1689304	1690505	Minus 50 experience!
1690545	1692726	Your boyfriend's been fucking around on your back!
1692907	1699072	I did like the fact how they have a quest where you get a chicken, like, pet to follow you around, and the chicken pet's easily killed.
1699557	1703119	So it's like a very complex quest for a really useless item.
1703980	1711704	You know, the last quest series of quests that I've been doing, and I'm on the last leg of this series, are the go to this fountain and fill this bottle and bring it back.
1712665	1723031	And I've done this with like five different locations, and now I'm going to the big town to give my bottle to somebody, and I'm like kind of underleveled for where I am because I've just been running quests.
1723413	1733624	I think it would be cooler in World of Warcraft if the chicken that followed you, you could start slashing it like over and over and then all of a sudden all the chickens start attacking you.
1733905	1738750	And then it says you got a cock in your ear, 50 experience points, and you got your brains fucked out.
1740592	1741393	Thank you, Extover.
1741613	1743896	I like playing the zombies though because you can eat people.
1745552	1749115	If you play the undead, you can regain energy by feeding on corpses.
1749295	1750316	That's lovely.
1750416	1752678	So what happens if somebody eats your corpse before you find it?
1753059	1754480	I think it's eating other corpses.
1754540	1755521	I haven't tried doing it yet.
1756142	1758504	The other good thing about it is that you regenerate XP.
1759885	1763848	And you regenerate your MP or energy if you're one of the undead.
1763868	1767111	You got sued by Konami.
1767352	1767892	That's great.
1767912	1769173	You got sued by Konami.
1769233	1769774	Minus 999 experience.
1772052	1777696	Wouldn't it be minus 573 experience points?
1777877	1786764	As I was saying, without saying anything, all I have to say is that this week, something, the most hilarious thing is about to happen.
1787164	1788566	I can't even put it into words.
1790267	1792729	Next week, you guys, is it going to be done by next Sunday?
1792849	1793550	Or do we have to wait two weeks?
1793570	1794110	It's Thursday.
1794691	1795832	So is it going to be done by next Sunday?
1797418	1798358	Stay tuned to our website.
1798378	1799779	We've got big news coming up.
1799899	1802380	And next Sunday, we're going to have a field day.
1802400	1803200	That's all I have to say.
1803240	1810063	I just find that the other thing that was occurring to me that I also find hilarious about that is just the number of things I'm going to have on display.
1810143	1810683	I know, I know.
1810723	1811544	When said person.
1811604	1811844	I know.
1812024	1812624	Anyway, anyway.
1813184	1814305	No more about that.
1814405	1814725	No more.
1814745	1815746	There's your teaser.
1815766	1816126	I dread.
1817066	1818647	I dread what's going to come of this.
1818747	1819627	I'll be bringing it out.
1819647	1820107	I dread.
1820447	1820668	All right.
1820728	1822008	Anyway, our listeners are so lost.
1822068	1822288	I know.
1822328	1823849	What the fuck are they talking about?
1825603	1828765	I'm going to be putting out my popping music controller.
1830786	1834788	If the listeners are going to accuse us of jumping the shark ever, next week will be it.
1835088	1835309	Oh yeah.
1835329	1836629	I swear to God, next week will be it.
1836669	1839211	I even find this hilarious, they asked for it.
1840071	1842633	You should put other like, Bomani and stuff.
1842913	1843773	Anyway, moving on.
1844393	1845034	We'll be around.
1845274	1846395	Loki, how was your week, how was your day?
1846755	1847835	My week was okay.
1849426	1850727	I didn't play that many games.
1850807	1853949	I played Burnout and more Burnout and more Burnout.
1856010	1862374	So anyways, my week started off with I had to go to Jury Duty.
1863315	1865216	Oh my god, you went to Jury Duty this week.
1865236	1865657	That's right.
1865837	1866077	Yes.
1866117	1866637	How'd that go?
1866977	1867738	I didn't get called.
1867778	1872621	Instead, I had to watch four movies because they played movies while we were waiting.
1872721	1873842	So I got to watch...
1874242	1885844	Advent Children again on my PSP, then I watched episode 4 of Star Wars, and then finally The Pacifier, followed by While You Were Sleeping.
1887113	1887553	XBOX 360 Games
1907927	1911008	You're supposed to let me take the doggies.
1911328	1911648	Oh, well.
1913448	1915209	So then, wow, what a nice guy.
1915969	1918930	So I pre-ordered Gun and Project Gotham Racing 3.
1918970	1920550	That's going to be awesome.
1921510	1923511	And what else did I do this week?
1923531	1924491	Eh, not too much.
1924511	1933693	I'm supposed to be getting stylish attire for the... Because I'm going to Lake Tahoe this week to actually...
1934392	1952158	for our 25th anniversary party for our company, and I have to wear stylist attire, so I have pinstripe pants, and I have to buy a shirt for it, I'm gonna look pimp, but anyways, what else, oh, that's pretty much it, you know, just lots of work stuff, and yeah.
1953530	1954111	Fun stuff like that.
1979654	1980034	They don't.
1980454	1980895	Yes, they do.
1981295	1983336	They turned the supersize into large.
1983596	1985897	No, large is not as big as supersize.
1985917	1989278	Trust me, I am missing out on potential drink and fries.
1989858	1996521	And, you know, they finally switched the cups back to these nice plastic ones that don't fucking blow up when I put them in my cup holder.
1996841	1998222	Because that was really fun.
1999222	2001483	But at least, you know, they have that fixed now.
2001903	2008386	And what I have to say is now this new Monopoly game you play online as well as collect the stupid pieces.
2008406	2009106	Yeah, that's what I heard.
2009349	2020016	So I've been playing it online and so far I've won three times the stupid prints at this fish something or other, I don't know, some stupid online photo place.
2020437	2022458	So now I can get like 75 exposures.
2022678	2024980	That's great, except I don't take pictures of anything.
2026040	2031224	You should take like pornographic pictures of something, or I don't know, like really raunchy photos.
2031384	2034666	Like take pictures of you and Ellie having sex or something and see if they'll develop it.
2034886	2035907	It won't develop that crap.
2036127	2036668	You don't know that.
2037068	2037328	Try it.
2037368	2037788	You know that.
2040433	2041234	It'll make a statement.
2042675	2043315	Oh, whatever.
2043375	2043735	Anyways.
2045136	2046477	I'm just trying to win something else.
2047357	2048959	But I do like these Best Buy bucks.
2049259	2052221	That's the only thing I really play it for, is these Best Buy bucks.
2052761	2055282	Because I got $4 from two different fries.
2055463	2058184	But why didn't you just the $4 that you would have spent on food?
2059145	2059905	I didn't spend it on food.
2060025	2064128	I wanted fries, but I also got fries and free money.
2064808	2065909	Hey, I like free money.
2065929	2066550	Whatever.
2066730	2067070	Whatever.
2068804	2072405	My week and my day was pretty okay.
2072465	2074846	Yesterday I went to Fry's, which is, you know, nerd heaven.
2074906	2077707	Fry's is this giant electronic store here on the West Coast.
2077747	2081388	I don't think they have it on the East, or it's slowly going out there or something.
2081668	2083269	It's also Outpost.com online.
2083689	2088050	And so I went to Fry's and I finally bought myself a gaming router, a wireless gaming router.
2088510	2092672	And what that will allow me to do is that, since Bug was good enough to give me a wireless...
2093832	2094592	Thank you for watching!
2112717	2126686	But anyway, without having to run a cord to the living room, because the Xbox and PlayStation are out in the living room, we have the routers in here for the computers, so I don't have a cable long enough, so I had to get a wireless gaming router, basically.
2126726	2129908	It's specifically something you use to plug your Xbox and PlayStation into.
2130328	2134811	So I bought one of those, and it's nice to be back on Xbox Live and getting killed at Halo.
2135745	2136145	What's that?
2136165	2136386	What's that?
2157425	2159167	I need to play some poppin' music stuff next break.
2160728	2164271	I have poppin' music 13 stuff I never got to in a previous week, I don't think, but anyway.
2164291	2166433	Thank you for reminding me.
2167013	2167934	What else did I do this week?
2168494	2169175	Not a whole lot.
2169195	2176521	I guess I started playing Extreme 2 online today, because since I got the router last night, I was playing Extreme 2 online a little bit today.
2178042	2178843	It's interesting.
2178863	2179564	It
2181772	2182413	Thanks for watching!
2200012	2212297	online thing where you can actually choose your opponent and choose your song, which is kind of interesting, but I wonder if that has to do with the fact that Xbox Live is just probably better set up for that kind of thing than the free PlayStation things.
2212417	2213158	I have no idea.
2213618	2221921	I don't program these games, so I don't know, but the online one, if you guys have played it, you know that you don't choose your opponent, you just search for an opponent, and you don't get to choose your song.
2221961	2225763	You only get to choose light, standard, heavy, or any.
2226723	2227784	So, it's interesting.
2228975	2255270	and I've played some top ranked players in the time that I've been on there and what's very interesting about doing that is that well, A, they've all really, really beat me but the other interesting thing is that it's randomly picking your song I've played probably like 15 to 18 matches online total which really isn't a lot, that's probably about less than an hour of game time I've played like 15 to 18 matches online Paranoia Survivor Max Heavy has come up three or four times at least
2256030	2258272	And there's supposed to be like 70 freaking songs in this game.
2258332	2259452	It's picking songs at random.
2259793	2266698	I got Paranoia Survivor Max three or four times out of, like, one out of every three matches was Paranoia Survivor Max.
2266718	2267338	That's crap.
2268379	2268939	That's such crap.
2269139	2271481	Because Paranoia Survivor Max has bullshit steps.
2271821	2275744	If I want to play a song with bullshit steps, I'll go play in the groove, okay?
2278174	2279315	So that's my experience with online.
2279455	2280235	Otherwise, it's okay.
2280375	2281396	I mean, I did the ranking thing.
2281696	2282676	It's fun, I guess.
2283117	2302287	You know, playing matches is okay, except you can't really talk to the person you're playing, so you can only imagine what their reaction is like, because I know I was playing one kid, and he was doing really well, and then all of a sudden, like, I think he got pissed off that he got a good or something, because all of a sudden you just see boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, and all these, you know, misses going up his side of the screen, so it's just kind of funny.
2302487	2304808	But you can't really hear him like you can on Xbox, so...
2305928	2306548	Oh, darn.
2306849	2307129	I know.
2307409	2309890	Then again, kids say really stupid shit on Xbox.
2310270	2311130	Not so much DDR.
2311150	2326015	The DDR rooms are rather decent compared to, like, Halo 2 or Doom 3, playing those online, and you got all those kids like, I'm gonna beat you up, I'm gonna cut you, I'm gonna shoot you, I do what I want!
2326455	2327076	Exactly.
2327536	2329376	My mom ain't home right now, I got a pony.
2336545	2336845	All right.
2337405	2338825	Anyway, so that's that.
2339845	2340465	Bogd, how was your week?
2340485	2340886	How was your day?
2342746	2344926	I sold all my DS stuff yesterday and picked up a PSP.
2346947	2349848	And just because, what attracted you to PSP?
2350248	2350928	The sound worked.
2352328	2353368	My DS's sound was dead.
2353388	2355869	They didn't ask me when I sold it if it worked or not.
2358038	2361861	That's because anything that doesn't fully function gets sent back for refurbishment.
2362441	2362581	Ah.
2363222	2368465	Nope, he didn't say anything about it, just... It's because they test them later, and if they don't work, they send it back to be refurbed.
2368765	2369026	Oh, good.
2369526	2376291	I still got my 55 bucks for that, and as it turned out, all my stuff was worth 150 bucks, and this is clear back to, like, Pokemon Silver.
2376831	2377091	Wow.
2377712	2378692	All my Game Boy stuff.
2379273	2380654	And, uh, Nintendogs.
2381074	2381214	Exactly.
2382042	2385843	I didn't play it often enough, but PSP I can at least do stuff other than play games on.
2386023	2390545	I think I'm kind of done with Nintendogs, which is kind of sad, because I really, really love that game.
2390625	2392866	I mean, and I remember saying it was like... It's over far too quick.
2393266	2400989	Yeah, it doesn't hold my interest long enough, and maybe I'm just trying to get more of a game out of it, and it's really not supposed to be that.
2402089	2402409	I don't know.
2402469	2403930	I hated that I have to play it.
2404699	2407621	It's just like, I'm like, oh, goddammit, I gotta feed the dog again.
2407681	2412164	I mean, that's not too surprising, because that's how Tamagotchis are, and that's how, you know, other virtual pets... I can't find my PS.
2412824	2413344	Oh, shit.
2413504	2415225	I left it in my locked drawer at work.
2415626	2416366	Because I take it to work.
2416806	2417487	Oh, maybe that's it.
2418067	2421229	Maybe, but my puppies are gonna be pissing all over my tatami house.
2422070	2424571	Well, they don't pee on the floor, like they do in, like, Sims 2 and stuff.
2424771	2425031	Mm-hmm.
2425392	2425532	No.
2426412	2426632	Anyway.
2428053	2428553	So, anything else?
2429974	2432616	Went down to the Bay Area and ran into random people that we know.
2433586	2438209	I went to Dave & Buster's for dinner, and as I was leaving, I was like, wow, that really looks like... Holy crap, it is!
2438909	2443292	And there's a large... They took out two of the driving games right next to the entrance.
2443972	2444292	What was it?
2444492	2446534	The Namco... Whatever the hell it was.
2447114	2447914	And the Tokyo Cop.
2448114	2448775	Maximum Tune?
2449475	2450376	Yeah, Maximum Tune.
2450396	2451236	I like Tokyo Cop.
2451576	2453037	That's not because we got Maximum Tune!
2453598	2454678	Yeah, they took out Maximum Tune.
2454718	2455479	It's not in there anymore.
2455619	2456139	Bastards.
2456419	2459661	But those two are gone, and there's now a giant six-player trivia game.
2460299	2461740	6-player trivia game?
2461760	2462720	6-player trivia game.
2462740	2465401	You have three buttons, A, B, and C. You just press the button of the answer.
2465642	2466642	That sounds kind of interesting.
2466662	2467182	It's a ticket game.
2467242	2468743	Okay, I figured, yeah.
2468943	2477788	So, as I walk up, our other intrepid listener had a pile of tickets running around her feet several times, as per usual.
2478228	2478728	That's great.
2478888	2481449	I think she came up, like, six tickets.
2481469	2482710	She bought an Xbox.
2483010	2483710	Yeah, she saved it for me.
2483730	2484731	This is Shark's Girl, by the way.
2484771	2486952	She's been on the show before, so some of our listeners might know her.
2486972	2487952	I don't know what she went by on here.
2487992	2488513	Shark's Girl.
2488773	2488993	Okay.
2489945	2491306	She now has $50,000 in one.
2491686	2495307	She came up six short, so I gave her three tickets to put her over $50,000.
2496528	2497548	What's she buying now?
2497728	2497948	PS3.
2501970	2502350	Wow.
2502790	2503250	That's crazy.
2503810	2509873	But that was really strange to just randomly... Run into people?
2509953	2510933	Randomly run into people.
2511633	2515715	And I was thinking about actually text messaging her and saying, Hey, are you up for Dave & Buster's tonight?
2515735	2515815	Yes.
2517113	2517653	She read your mind.
2518013	2518534	Apparently so.
2518614	2518954	Amazing.
2519994	2522795	I want to go check out the trivia game, although I am sad about Tokyo Cop.
2523375	2523675	Don't be.
2524396	2525436	I like Tokyo Cop.
2526056	2527297	Tokyo Cop was really awful.
2528597	2529277	You bastards.
2529477	2534539	If it's the same game I'm thinking of, it's like right there when you walk through the door.
2534659	2536080	I like Tokyo Cop.
2536700	2537220	Nobody else did.
2537460	2542722	You know what they need to get anywhere because they're releasing it over here is the Mario Kart arcade game.
2543342	2545323	Holy God do I want to play that so bad.
2545984	2547184	That's geared towards kids.
2547524	2547785	No, it's not.
2548265	2549125	No, I don't care.
2549185	2550125	I'll kick the kids out.
2551145	2553786	Well, all they have to do is put something you can hold your beer in.
2554766	2555447	Exactly.
2556107	2558608	I'll tell you what, that F-Zero arcade game kicked ass.
2558628	2561528	The only problem with F-Zero arcade game is that there was like three tracks.
2561548	2562309	Four.
2562329	2563369	Yeah, like four tracks.
2563689	2565069	And F-Zero, fuck that.
2565409	2568790	That F-Zero arcade game could have been amazing if they put more tracks on it.
2569371	2570471	And like more to do.
2570491	2572131	I wasn't so damn excited.
2572151	2573652	But the F-Zero arcade game was awesome.
2573732	2574172	I liked it.
2575097	2581281	Well, the nice thing about going to Dave & Buster's for dinner and stuff, they had the $13.99, get a $10 card.
2581861	2585803	Now it's $14.99 all day, Monday through Thursday.
2586904	2592027	By the way, secret message from our chat room, Poland, Poland, Poland, yes.
2594062	2595343	There you go.
2595603	2596223	She's psychic.
2596243	2599085	Sharkskrill just hopped in chat and said Poland, Poland.
2599185	2600246	She's probably listening.
2600726	2602207	I think so.
2602607	2603027	She claims to.
2603147	2605389	Her boyfriend was in chat earlier, so I think they're both listening.
2605869	2606409	It looks that way.
2606669	2606830	Yes.
2608070	2608431	Poland.
2608811	2609571	Definitely Poland.
2609771	2611552	Is that like a trivia question thing or something?
2611572	2613634	Yeah, everyone else answered right because it was pretty obvious.
2614874	2616415	And, well, she didn't.
2618617	2619197	All right, anyway.
2619637	2620858	I don't even remember the whole question.
2621684	2622544	It was something about Poland.
2622985	2624385	No, it wasn't about Poland.
2624405	2626367	It was about somebody being from a certain country.
2627407	2630929	And one of the choices was Poland, but the right answer was something completely odd.
2632230	2633711	I want to try this game out sometime.
2633731	2635431	I'm going to have to go back to Dave & Buster's.
2636012	2637533	I wish they'd build one here.
2637713	2641435	I love the idea of a Chuck E. Cheese for adults where kids aren't allowed after a certain time.
2641775	2642635	That's like heaven to me.
2643196	2644396	I don't think they should be allowed at all.
2644436	2646598	In heaven, I don't want children to be allowed after 11 o'clock.
2649329	2651511	If you could just beat them up and kick them out of the way.
2651891	2652132	Yeah.
2652392	2655535	Kind of like how in Katamari, when you hold down the button and run, you can keep off the cousins out.
2655595	2655995	Exactly.
2656255	2658017	Yeah, that would be perfect for kids at midnight.
2659278	2663122	Because drunken rages are just like... Extifer, how was your week?
2663142	2663722	How was your day?
2665484	2668967	It was pretty much your usual week for me.
2669087	2671850	I went to work, you know...
2673683	2679312	Played music at home, showered, shaved, masturbated
2680447	2681268	More than a few times.
2682088	2688071	And also, you know, on Fridays, Fridays have officially been dubbed Firefly Fridays.
2688752	2693995	And so, Jamie and I, or DarkSakura and I, have... I prefer my name.
2694295	2703240	Okay, Jamie and I went ahead and we went ahead and watched up to the end of the second disc of Firefly, which was great, good times.
2703700	2704941	The James Bond episode.
2705982	2707683	Yeah, it's pretty funny.
2707824	2708624	Pretty funny stuff.
2708805	2709666	Still recommend the movie.
2709706	2710847	A hero called me.
2712208	2712689	That was great.
2712789	2714411	Okay, sorry.
2715091	2718956	So anyhow, we went and saw, we saw that at our place.
2718976	2726924	And then we also went to Lyons where I got to explain why Pez candy is like the sheepskin condom of candy.
2730846	2731886	Oh, you want to know why?
2732066	2732807	Oh, okay.
2734067	2735327	Probably not, but okay.
2735828	2740249	Because sheepskin condoms are like the classic that nobody really thinks about now.
2741409	2742430	And so are Pez candies.
2745731	2746691	Pez candies go in those now?
2748032	2748993	They just may.
2749394	2755500	You know, a sheepskin condom Pez candy dispenser, that might be something to talk about.
2755700	2756922	Just move on, please.
2757482	2758944	So that would make the Pez condiments, right?
2760746	2761327	Hehehe.
2763749	2766512	So anyways, that was my week.
2766973	2769776	As for yesterday, it wasn't that great.
2769877	2773821	It was kind of one of those dramatic family days.
2774442	2777466	I did end up seeing a movie that I'll probably talk about later on.
2779508	2782569	But otherwise, that's really all.
2782890	2794655	Today I bought Taiko Drum Master because I've been like kind of, oh, that's another thing that Jamie and I did on Friday night was I got to play her Taiko Drum Master, which is so much funner with two people, but it's still fun as with one person.
2795235	2795535	Funner.
2795795	2796135	Funner.
2796475	2797936	Yeah, funner is the new word of the day.
2798376	2799957	So much more fun, whatever, fuck you.
2801778	2802558	Smart ass.
2803519	2806600	So anyways, that's how the week was.
2809079	2816321	You know, I seem to remember that when we moved in together, and you know, you're going to be the roommate and everything, you didn't really like video games an awful lot.
2816361	2817481	Like, you had a few GameCube games.
2817501	2819082	You liked Metroid, you liked Donkey Konga.
2820122	2822643	Now you're running out to GameStop, I gotta get Tycho Drummaster!
2822803	2825224	Well, I mean, Tycho Drummaster's like Donkey Konga.
2825564	2827504	It's a hell of a lot better than Donkey Konga.
2828164	2830025	It's great, but, you know...
2831370	2835736	I'm not so much bad with the video game stuff.
2836216	2837478	I can get into stuff.
2838079	2839500	I used to be into it when I was little.
2841002	2842404	I played the Mario Brothers.
2843566	2843946	Thank you.
2844767	2846269	Oh, no problem for that.
2846469	2846830	All right.
2848062	2849762	We're going to go to a quick break, boys and girls.
2849782	2852763	When we come back, maybe we'll do some Bomani news if there's anything going on.
2852783	2853603	I don't know.
2853903	2854484	I have to look.
2854544	2855284	It's been a long week.
2855784	2860465	And we'll also get into the CAVE match tonight at some point, the FU's of the week.
2860805	2861745	Oh, I want to talk about this, too.
2861825	2866527	Listen to our podcast this week, boys and girls, because we're going to be giving away PSP games.
2866947	2868347	We're giving away Death Jr.
2869287	2871428	and Coated Arms on this week's podcast.
2871628	2872248	Isn't that lovely?

2892093	2892873	We'll be back after this.

3143268	3146639	Please tell me, is your role in my heartache?
3146679	3149789	Take me now, but I can't take it anymore
3180653	3181459	Thank you for watching!
3337135	3337819	DarkSakura.com
3385237	3388421	After this song, we'll be having a Let Them Move Marathon.
3388701	3390864	No!
3390984	3391645	Just kidding.
3392085	3393127	Orange Lounge Radio.
3393207	3394808	Crap-free Bavani Radio.
3396110	3397772	We're back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
3397792	3399354	That was some music from Poppin' Music 13.
3400075	3402598	I think they're calling that Carnival is the subtitle of that.
3403290	3408937	I haven't followed pop music in a little while, sorry kids, but they don't really have an arcade machine exactly around the corner.
3409658	3417988	Soda Fujimori with Spring Comes Around, the little 8-bit sounding song, I kind of, or actually, it's not so much 8-bit sounding, but it sounds like an old Commodore 64 game, I kind of dig this track.
3419377	3430280	That was Saitone with Opportunity, and DJ Taka with Moon in there as well, featuring Erika Mochizuki, and then Desro was the last one there, and the track is called Sun.
3430960	3435341	Some Japanese text after that I can't read, because it's all garbled on my computer anyway, so Sun something.
3438382	3440423	And a lot of folks in the chat room are saying, hey, it's Daikinkai!
3440503	3441743	Well, yeah, it's Desro.
3441763	3442523	You know what I miss?
3442823	3443003	What?
3443344	3445264	I sort of miss the move.
3446584	3448145	I don't think I have that anywhere.
3448165	3448265	Ah!
3449093	3450174	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3477973	3482954	And some folks are kind of wondering, what's so great about the Xbox 360?
3483234	3486215	Should I be going out and picking up one of these Xbox 360s at launch?
3486715	3487515	Should I wait?
3488035	3489555	What games are actually going to be released?
3489615	3493576	And boy, it seems like that launch list of Xbox 360 titles is getting shorter and shorter, doesn't it?
3493836	3494056	Yep.
3494616	3495976	There's another one that moved.
3496016	3496556	What moved now?
3497617	3499837	Wasn't it Project Gotham Racing, wasn't it?
3499857	3501597	No, Project Gotham's still there.
3501617	3502798	That's a launch title.
3502898	3504758	Microsoft's already guaranteed that's going to launch.
3505418	3510200	That cameo and Perfect Dark Zero are guaranteed to launch.
3510780	3513661	In fact, they actually pushed them up a week, so now they're coming out November 10th.
3514121	3522384	Anyways, what did move, though, was Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter, one of the really cool squad-based first-version shooters that was coming out.
3522704	3530287	That got pushed all the way back to February, and before that was Frame City Killer, put out by Namco, which also got pushed back to February.
3531099	3532100	for more tweaking.
3532120	3536885	I think Ghost Recon, what they're trying to do is finish the 360 stuff so they can launch them all at once.
3537986	3543210	So that basically eliminated what I was going to try to bring in as one of the first games.
3543651	3552419	I have pre-booked Gun, which is Grand Theft Auto and the Wild West, and then Project Gotham 3, which looks amazing from what I've seen in the gameplay footage.
3552699	3556263	Plus it has a minigame in it, Geometry Wars 2, which looks pretty cool.
3556883	3558804	Yeah, what the hell is this about the minigame that's in it?
3558864	3562725	Isn't it like, uh, frickin', you said it was like by the people that did Rez?
3562965	3564265	Well, it's not by the people that did Rez.
3564325	3567346	I said it looks like a cross between Asteroids, Rez.
3567406	3568547	I got really excited for a minute.
3568567	3572788	I was like, oh my god, because Rez is one of those titles that was so sexy and it was completely overlooked.
3572808	3579170	No, it is, it looks pretty cool, and apparently Geometry Wars 1 was available as a hidden game in Project Gotham 2.
3580080	3580480	XBOX Live Arcade
3604113	3605493	It's kind of a new puzzle game.
3606093	3610374	Then there's another one that they showed, which is like a Marble Madness type game called Marble Blast.
3611395	3614815	But then this game, though, is going to be coming with Project Gotham 3.
3615536	3617456	And I've seen gameplay footage of it.
3617476	3621697	I was trying to bring some up to show you guys in the studio, but it looks amazing.
3622137	3623497	And I don't know.
3623517	3625578	I think it would be a perfect PSP game.
3626892	3628673	I'm worried about all these titles pushing back.
3628894	3633938	It's kind of like Microsoft really, really wants this system out this Christmas.
3634839	3636220	Well, and at this point, they can't push back.
3636240	3636900	They really can't.
3636960	3639302	I mean, they'll piss off America if they push the system back any further.
3639322	3640423	Well, they're not going to push the system.
3640623	3645788	These games at launch... But what's the point of buying the system if there's no games available at launch?
3645808	3646989	There's going to be like 20-some games.
3647289	3649571	I know, but nothing that I really want.
3650191	3650772	Thanks for watching!
3662987	3672113	I picked up that Tecmo collection, I'm going to talk about this again on the podcast, but that Tecmo collection, I picked it up for Xbox, and it has the arcade game version of Tecmo Bowl on it, so not what I remember.
3672933	3675475	The NES version was so much more fluid and fun.
3676295	3676996	Anyway, sorry.
3677116	3682479	Anyways, for the 360, if you like sports, definitely going to be a system for you.
3683301	3686343	If you want racing games, there's going to be a lot of stuff.
3686383	3689884	Project Gotham, Ridge Racer, Need for Speed, Most Wanted.
3690505	3691625	Those are going to be three big ones.
3691845	3692446	Carmageddon?
3693146	3693766	No, Carmageddon.
3693966	3694607	Full Auto!
3694927	3696608	Full Auto coming out next year.
3696668	3697868	That one is exciting.
3698188	3698989	Put out by Sega.
3699249	3701630	It's like a cross between Twisted Metal and Burnout.
3701930	3703271	And all you have to do is mention Burnout.
3703311	3703811	Basically...
3704326	3707788	Giant, you know, cars with guns on them, shooting each other, you can blow up buildings.
3707848	3709910	Okay, like Spy Hunter on crack.
3710150	3710630	Yeah.
3710650	3711051	Okay, cool.
3711071	3712451	Yeah, it's going to be freaking awesome.
3712471	3713872	But anyways, they have that one.
3714673	3717715	You know, that was the Xbox, that was the problem I had with the Xbox.
3717735	3727862	Because I, and it's no secret that on this program, because this program's been on long enough, where, you know, when we were first starting this program, PlayStation 2 was kind of new still, and Xbox was just on its way out.
3728462	3738326	and I said there's no effing way I'm ever going to buy an Xbox because all the Xbox is is sports games, racers, I had an acronym for it.
3738446	3739706	It's Sarsi.
3739826	3740887	It's Sarsi games.
3740927	3741207	That's it.
3741247	3742127	It's Sars games.
3742207	3745308	It's sports, action, racing, shooters.
3746069	3748429	Yeah, that's pretty much everything that comes out nowadays, though.
3749870	3752391	I guess because that's what sells, but... Well, let's put it this way.
3752411	3753411	Okay, RPGs.
3753811	3755132	You've got Cameo, which is...
3756059	3758902	I do like the rare first-person shooter game.
3759002	3760463	I love Halo, for one, that's for sure.
3784111	3799879	Um, then, what else, um, for, like, your non-mainstream stuff, they've got Tony Hawk's American Wasteland, Gun, which is gonna be coming out, King Kong, um, they'll be coming out right afterwards, and then there's a dead spell of nothing until about...
3801280	3802281	January, I think.
3802401	3804142	And then that's when there's some more games coming out.
3804462	3806824	But of course, you know, more stuff will be announced as we get closer.
3806884	3810907	Is it going to be like the DS launch where they kind of blow their load when the system first comes out?
3810987	3814349	And then you go through this like, and PSP, oh my god, the PSP.
3814790	3818252	PSP totally blew its load when it first came out and then six months of nothing.
3818272	3818812	Well, look at it this way.
3819113	3822955	December is a dead month as far as games coming out anyways for all systems.
3823015	3828219	It's just, they push stuff out of, you know, December and there's like 12 games total.
3828679	3829360	I mean, that's it.
3829801	3831382	And some of us wait until Christmas Eve Eve to do it.
3831402	3831582	That's me.
3831602	3833822	December 23rd, every year I do my Christmas shopping.
3855011	3855391	Bloodstains
3879526	3880707	No, but I'm hoping.
3880747	3881887	I wish, but no.
3883228	3884848	Just really amazing stuff.
3885069	3887009	Quake 4 is going to be awesome.
3887630	3889891	Gun is just, I don't even know what Gun's going to be.
3889911	3890931	Gun's going to be phenomenal.
3891371	3895153	And then, I don't know, I'm going to pick up one more game.
3895433	3896053	$60 for these games.
3896093	3897654	I was looking at EB Games.
3897674	3900055	They have a whole big display trying to get people to pre-order this stuff.
3900075	3900555	$60 a game.
3903021	3903401	Yep.
3903742	3904102	Crazy.
3904743	3908646	It's lame, but everything I buy is on store credit.
3909326	3914271	Right, right.
3914311	3921497	So a lot of people, we have a lot of younger listeners that listen to this program who don't hold down full-time jobs, so they can't exactly run out and buy a system.
3921797	3924059	And please don't get us wrong either.
3924179	3928163	I mean, yes, I have a full-time job, but it's hard for me to go out and buy these systems.
3928203	3930224	If gaming wasn't a huge hobby of mine...
3931245	3940307	That's probably the only reason I'm going to buy a 360 on launch is because I feel like I have to to stay on top of what's going on in the industry for the podcast and stuff.
3940327	3941808	Well, here's what I'm saying here.
3942508	3945629	Don't go out and buy the system if you're unsure if you want it or not.
3946129	3954271	The only reason I'm buying one, same reason I bought PSP close to launch, same reason I bought DS, is because I'm a gaming whore and I'll have to pick this stuff up.
3954898	3976029	for two reasons, one to stay on, to have an edge at work, you know, the game sales stuff I do, and just an edge on everything, and then also just because I have to get everything, even though, you know, I may not play it, like my GameCube, you know, but it just, there's a lot of stuff coming out, if you have a PSP, definitely pick one of those up, DS,
3977079	3978639	Tons of stuff for internet, you know?
3978779	3978979	Yeah.
3979559	3981100	Oh, I'm so excited about DS Internet.
3981160	3982980	I'm going to have them all anyway.
3983000	3986801	I was going to kind of ask you about this because you're kind of a systems whore.
3986921	3987841	You make no secret about that.
3987861	3991422	You own, like, is there any system that's ever been released that you do not own?
3991602	3992582	I don't have a CD-i.
3993222	3995682	I don't have a Fairchild Channel S, although Dan has owned one.
3995702	3996342	Do you have a 3DO?
3996983	3997123	No.
3997143	3997823	Okay.
3997943	3998723	Don't want a 3DO.
3998803	3999223	Yeah, I know.
3999423	4001063	Who wants a 3DO, really?
4001103	4003304	Is there any game on the 3DO that makes that system worthwhile?
4003324	4003764	Okay, okay, okay.
4003784	4003824	A 1?
4004884	4005424	What do I have?
4006325	4008365	I have a Neo Geo, I have a Neo Geo CD.
4008645	4011386	Okay, if we ask what you do have, it's going to take you all day.
4011426	4013947	Yeah, but what I don't have also could take me all day.
4014087	4019909	The thing that's at the top of my list of what I want right now, realistically, is a Duo RX.
4020890	4022230	A PC Engine Duo RX.
4022310	4023831	Okay, so we know you're going to get a 360 at launch.
4023871	4025371	I'm actually wanting the PS3 more.
4027532	4037058	Yeah, there's also the fact that your husband works at GameStop, so you also, in your household, kind of have a need to stay on top of what's going on in the gaming world, right?
4037098	4040721	With you doing the radio and him doing the selling of the items in the store.
4040801	4046144	Yeah, we're gonna have all that, and on top of that, any game that comes out, he can basically check it out of the store.
4046344	4046745	Right, right.
4046765	4048526	He can play it all we want to and put it back.
4048826	4050067	Yeah, that's cool.
4050427	4051007	Not a big deal.
4051687	4053568	But you say you're more excited about PS3?
4054168	4054408	Yeah.
4054488	4055909	Why?
4056349	4075555	Having studied a bit more on the cell processor myself, prior to seeing the demo at E3, and that knowing that there's going to be a new Tekken, oh my god, and other things that I'm more than positive will be out based on things that I've seen.
4076235	4082424	The Final Fantasy remake, which I know is still just a rumor but I'm convinced it's happening.
4083266	4084187	What was the other thing?
4087150	4089151	Damn it, racing game that's incredibly fun.
4089171	4090852	Gran Turismo, thank you, Gran Turismo.
4090872	4092893	I'm not as excited about Gran Turismo, but Dan is.
4094873	4114462	Just knowing that... And on top of that, I really, really hope that people... See, the PlayStation 2, I think, would have been better had people been more skilled in programming games for it because they didn't... There wasn't a lot of... I wouldn't say very good use of the channels because...
4114742	4116544	Hence the jaggedy games, you know.
4116844	4120186	Like, oh, let's put in surround sound, but not, you know, make the game look nice.
4121427	4121748	Hello?
4124722	4149615	and me, I always go for the underdog system myself so that would normally put me on the boat with the revolution however, I think that the controller is retarded and the Xbox games, I'm really not too excited about anything coming out on the 360 I can't knock the Nintendo controller though until I get to touch it and play a game and see how it really feels racing games, yay sports games
4150433	4150833	Yay.
4150913	4154956	And that's, to bring it full circle, that's how I felt about the Xbox when it first came out.
4154996	4156757	And then sure enough, I got to play it.
4156777	4159359	Well, all that's going to end up in my house is Project Gotham.
4159399	4164162	And I'm like, I'm tired of Dan playing Need for Speed Underground 2 all the damn time.
4164242	4166584	He'll bring in Need for Speed Most Wanted then, Underground 3.
4167605	4168165	Goodie, goodie.
4168285	4168746	Yay!
4169146	4170427	Oh, gee!
4170647	4179313	Finally, I caved, and I bought an Xbox when Halo... I finally got to play Halo for the first time, and I was like, wow, this is a shooter I actually really enjoy.
4179873	4180874	And Halo 2, of course.
4181274	4186698	The DDR on Xbox, which I still believe the Ultramix 2 is the best DDR game they put out, period.
4187338	4187438	And...
4189640	4191883	There's another, Fable, I actually kind of enjoy a little bit.
4192263	4194425	And all that is on Xbox.
4195006	4199491	And so Xbox finally kind of grew out of the SARS games for me.
4199871	4210382	On top of that, I'm probably going to be getting an import PS3 as well, because I know that there are going to be more games coming out overseas on the PS3 than there will be on the Xbox 360.
4211448	4212148	I want to bring this up.
4212649	4215090	I've been wanting to bring this topic up on the show for like two weeks.
4215110	4215830	Now it just hit me.
4216050	4218111	You saying this reminded me to bring this up.
4220372	4223734	Obviously, we've been to E3, so we've talked to a lot of people in the industry.
4223754	4225274	We continue to talk to some of those people.
4225894	4229236	I was having a very interesting conversation with somebody who works in the industry not that long ago.
4230817	4239841	This person was saying that there was a game that the company wanted to bring out that had a lot of hype going for it in Japan.
4240709	4241050	I think.
4241570	4246534	The game is something that some people in Japan are looking forward to, and they wanted to bring it out here.
4248156	4257024	But I guess Sony gets some type of approval over what games actually come out for the system, and Sony rejected the game, saying it's too Japanese.
4258083	4258744	That's stupid.
4259044	4260626	And I'm thinking, what?
4261186	4263729	You rejected a game because it's too Japanese?
4264149	4268874	And then my second thought is, how in the fuck did Katamari Damacy ever come out in this country?
4268914	4272098	Even better, why did it sell better here than there?
4274175	4274675	which is true.
4276456	4277576	That boggled my mind.
4277596	4279917	From what I understand, the game cut even in Japan.
4280017	4281598	Here, it just, like, oversold.
4281958	4283458	No one likes Japanese stuff.
4283498	4293042	I mean, that's why, you know, you see all these networks like G4 TV, oh, I don't know, you know, Cartoon Network, all this stuff.
4293322	4300724	You know, they're, of course, not playing any anime of any sort whatsoever, so obviously no one likes the Japanese culture at all.
4300744	4302565	I mean, that's why you don't see people out there
4304365	4318249	And I can see where maybe Sony wants some type of quality control over the games, but... And then I think, my god, why did Driver 3 come out?
4318389	4323470	All they need, all they need, well actually Sony right now is hiring for localization.
4324511	4325491	For localization people.
4325990	4337599	Which leads me to think that, you know, I was taking that as a positive sign for a little while, hoping that they were saying, hey, you know, these import games are, you know, doing really big in the States.
4337619	4340661	They've got a big, you know, how else did we get DDR here?
4340681	4345024	That's also a good question, and now Beatmania on its way out, too.
4345104	4347846	I understand how they could reject the game because it's too Japanese anyways.
4348187	4350108	So if the game's too Japanese, then it won't sell.
4350188	4351709	Then that company won't make any money.
4351809	4353591	At least it's not crap, so it's not...
4353971	4354412	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4373463	4374304	We have DDR now.
4375045	4376266	And we also have cheap knockoffs.
4376546	4394644	Well, an interesting follow-up to that is that the same person said that since that game's not going to come out here for the PlayStation now, that a different form, I obviously really don't want to give this away because of the nature of the story, but a different type of game in the series will be coming out on Xbox.
4396124	4396764	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4417041	4417682	The Chaff.
4419082	4421884	Have you seen some of those budget titles they have now for like PlayStation 1?
4422344	4424645	Maybe they let those come out because they don't care anymore.
4424665	4427486	Those are just like the ultimate in... Like the $5 and $10 Walmart games.
4427506	4428387	Incredible Crisis!
4428647	4435070	The Texas Hold'em 50,000... Puzzle Star!
4435110	4437211	Oh, and then the PopCap games.
4437551	4444054	Things that you can play for free on the internet, on Flash, coming out for like Game Boy Advance and PlayStation.
4444594	4445735	Bejeweled, again!
4445755	4445795	No!
4446075	4446596	Catamari Sells
4461991	4462792	www.orangeloungeradio.com
4483752	4484633	We're opening that up.
4485113	4490116	Not a whole lot of people signed into Skype tonight, so I'm thinking maybe we're going to have a dry night of Skype calls.
4490896	4492037	I don't know what's going on, though.
4492077	4498721	People would... People freaking call, or we set you on fire and do nothing but talk about Britney Spears' baby.
4499922	4502523	No, I don't want to... Didn't you do that last week?
4502583	4504484	Okay, let's have Britney Spears C-section chat.
4504524	4505645	No, I don't... Oh, gross.
4505905	4506345	God.
4506986	4510608	I would rather go back to talking about the sheepskin con than what the hell I said about it earlier.
4510628	4512129	She's worried that her scar won't go away.
4513843	4514583	Poor thing.
4516024	4517765	You know, and of course she spoke the whole time.
4517805	4518405	She carried over that.
4518425	4518785	Hey, look at that.
4518825	4519445	We got a call.
4519485	4519905	Look at that.
4520106	4524007	Just for you, DarkSakura, it's our regular caller on the line.
4524867	4525388	How are you?
4525408	4527348	Huh?
4527609	4527969	Hello?
4529109	4529409	Yeah.
4529509	4530370	You on the radio?
4532150	4532571	Who's this?
4534351	4534651	Yeah.
4536332	4537472	Obviously you know who it is.
4538073	4539953	Yes, it's the legend of Zaku, everybody.
4540134	4541014	How are you, my friend?
4543556	4554711	I'm just waiting for my Yankees to finish up the Angels so we can take the game to their place tomorrow and win.
4554951	4556073	What's baseball?
4556133	4557455	What is the baseball?
4558596	4560738	It's the number one sport in Japan, ever.
4560758	4561539	I'm from the Bronx.
4561699	4563280	I love Yankees.
4563340	4569366	Yankees are, you know, Yankees basically are up there in breathing and lovemaking.
4569486	4579215	Saku, I know how it is, because in this town where we live, they don't have a, well, they do have a minor league baseball team, but they have a really big basketball team, and I swear to God, everywhere you go, it's king.
4579315	4581217	Thanks for watching!
4601859	4606145	Digital Life starts this Friday, so I'm heading there this Saturday.
4606625	4610310	I don't know if I'm going to compete in freestyle because I'm having second thoughts.
4610830	4614555	The fact that I don't have any money to prepare for a really good one is just making it worse.
4621623	4626730	I've judged a few, and trust me, Zaku, you couldn't be as bad as some of the ones I've seen in my life.
4627191	4628272	I know, I've done it before.
4628312	4630716	I've done a really good one, even though I DQ'd.
4630756	4637485	But this year, in the tournament this year, they're using an impartial jury.
4638152	4642593	In other words, they're using people that don't know shit about DER.
4642613	4645374	That means you're going to have a horribly scored tournament.
4648214	4655896	No, because last year, the judges were biased and basically handed people victories where they should have went to others.
4656296	4659217	That's why you have equal representation.
4659257	4661338	Trust me, it was biased.
4661458	4661998	I saw it.
4663158	4666482	Let me finish before you go jumping all over me.
4667102	4669404	That's why you need equal representation.
4669444	4674329	You need a certain number of people who know what good freestyle is.
4675190	4678554	You need at least one freestyle winner in there.
4679595	4685440	And you need to have two people on there who may not have competed in DDR, but people who...
4686121	4688943	You know, you would trust to be impartial.
4689224	4692186	And I think that you do need to have judges who have not actually played.
4692266	4693107	I agree with the mix.
4693207	4694008	I agree with the mix.
4694028	4694768	We did have that.
4694928	4696730	We did have that last year, and it failed.
4697090	4699552	Because that ended up doing more harm than good.
4700012	4701554	We had everything that we said, Jamie.
4701814	4704596	That's what I've done before, and I've had success.
4704616	4705997	That has to do with people.
4707058	4708800	Yeah, because we have to play it safe.
4708840	4714905	We don't want any bullshit, and, you know, we don't want any bullshit from other people saying that they got screwed over, that they should have won, so...
4716104	4718726	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4746584	4752187	I really wish we were able to get a sneak peek of Guitar Hero 2, but sometimes we just don't get our way.
4753508	4754408	Hopefully.
4755189	4766495	As I said, I still have time to register for freestyle, but at this point I wish I had the money to really invest on something memorable and something that will even give me...
4773161	4774502	I wish I could have gone to Digital Life.
4774602	4777044	I would have judged you a fair tournament, I swear.
4777064	4777565	I know, man.
4777625	4779747	I'm going to let you go because we have other people who want to get in.
4780268	4781248	But have a good night, Zaku, okay?
4781369	4782149	Alright, man.
4782550	4783170	Alright, later.
4784111	4786192	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4813197	4815159	Anyway, moving on, let's see what the next caller wants.
4816840	4817981	Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4820584	4822145	Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4825268	4826789	Is your microphone on, caller?
4826929	4827230	Hello.
4828462	4830082	Do you have a throat?
4830142	4833323	It's a new caller calling in, so I think maybe it's not working right.
4833783	4835503	What's that, Echo123 or whatever?
4835523	4838644	Yeah, give Echo123 a call and try us back, alrighty?
4838884	4839264	Have a good one.
4839884	4845105	So, remember guys, before you call in the first time, it's always a good idea to call.
4845325	4847706	There's a username on Skype, Echo123.
4848006	4849426	Make sure you can hear yourself.
4849526	4851047	But, you know, that kind of stuff's bound to happen.
4851087	4853247	We appreciate the new people are at least trying to get through.
4853967	4857688	Not that we don't like hearing from the regulars, but new blood once in a while is a good thing.
4858248	4861250	Let's go to... Oh, damn, our lines are lighting up here.
4861290	4861930	Let's go to another call.
4862190	4863191	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
4864512	4866013	Hey, Sky, it's Al Mullet calling.
4866193	4866933	Al Mullet!
4866973	4868014	How the hell have you been?
4869035	4871056	I have been doing pretty damn good, Sky.
4871096	4872257	How about yourself?
4872397	4872677	Good.
4872817	4875859	I have not heard from you in, like, three months.
4875879	4876399	Where have you been?
4877520	4878921	I dropped off the face of the earth.
4879001	4880702	Funny story, but we'll get to that in a minute.
4880902	4882043	Okay, well, what's on your mind?
4882103	4883804	What do we owe this call to today?
4885226	4890149	I think I missed the initial hullabaloo on Extreme 2 and just want to offer my input on it.
4890309	4891030	Sure, yeah.
4891130	4896273	A lot of people really appreciate your input because, of course, you write reviews and, of course, I'll let you get your plug.
4896293	4897254	Are you still working for those guys?
4898154	4899155	Yes, I am.
4899315	4900776	I'll let you work in your plug there.
4901056	4906580	But a lot of folks in the Bomani scene really trust your reviews on the game, so I'm very curious to hear your thoughts on Extreme 2.
4908390	4910572	Extreme 2 really impressed me.
4910772	4917337	Maybe not as much as a song list, a song list was great anyway, but the presentation really impressed me.
4918037	4928084	The fact that Dance Master Mode is now the official mode of the game, it's more like other games, you know, like...
4930365	4941349	This is why I said about it last week, Amol, is that it feels less like an arcade port and more like a PlayStation game, as opposed to just trying to copy exactly what's going on in the arcade.
4941709	4946491	Having the Dance Master be the central thing makes it feel more like something that is for the home.
4946531	4956135	And since we're not getting a new arcade mix anytime soon, it's kind of interesting to see the franchise really now for the first time in America kind of growing out of that.
4956575	4957115	So it's kind of neat.
4958188	4958889	Yeah, exactly.
4959129	4960830	And also the background movies.
4960870	4967756	I cannot get enough of all of these new movies, especially since there's so many exclusive movies for a particular song.
4968336	4971619	I mean, Daikin Kai jumped like a million points for me.
4971919	4972139	Yeah.
4972620	4973701	I play that for the movie.
4974941	4975862	It's got some great videos.
4975902	4982506	I still have yet to see some of the ones, like the one for Sakurai here is really good, and some of the other ones, because I haven't played enough Dance Master Mode.
4982706	4985568	Believe it or not, I'm actually playing Dance Master Mode on a pad.
4986068	4991771	So I'm getting slow for some of them.
4993932	4996394	It took me a week to unlock all the songs.
4996474	5002477	I ended up with like 73, then I took a break for a few days, and then I came back to it and unlocked Survivor Max.
5004198	5005520	Have you had a chance to play the online mode?
5006520	5008262	Unfortunately, no, not yet.
5008442	5015787	I mean, I've tried to find time for it, but things keep popping up, and I'd rather be unlocking courses and whatnot because I'm an unlock whore.
5017229	5017749	Right, right.
5019550	5023413	Although, is it true or not, I haven't really heard any follow-up on this.
5023673	5030599	Some rumors are going around that the game will give you pity unlocks if you go for a long time without unlocking anything, that it finally just starts giving them to you.
5031414	5036198	Yes, I can confirm that you will get pity stuff showing up in the shop for no particular reason.
5036379	5036679	Great.
5037019	5052373	I only say this because I go back and I do the extra arrow missions and the alternate conditions, and as I'm doing that, unlocking the hidden missions, I'm getting a bunch of songs up here in the shop.
5053354	5067488	and it's really interesting because I ended up unlocking all the characters at one point and once I unlocked my last character a bunch of songs showed up for no reason.
5068283	5071506	I noticed a bunch of songs randomly showed up in my shop, too.
5071606	5078371	So, you know, for those folks that are getting angsty with Dance Master Mode, just keep trying, and the game will pity you eventually, and you'll start getting some cool songs.
5079212	5079693	Exactly.
5080193	5083676	One other thing I want to... Well, first of all, go ahead and give your site a plug, because it's been a little while.
5085241	5090385	www.insidepulse.com We are reviewing games, kicking ass, and taking names.
5090425	5091066	Hey, that rhymed.
5091286	5091646	Sounds good.
5091706	5099992	And you also do, like, it's not just games, but there's wrestling, and there's movies and TVs and all that stuff.
5100473	5104656	Movies, TVs, music, comic books, and action figures.
5105016	5106097	The whole nine yards.
5106197	5107078	Everything nerdy.
5107858	5111241	They just call that beanerd.com because it's everything nerdy.
5114102	5121566	I have to add, Series 2 of the Invader Zim figurines are out now, and that made me extremely excited.
5121706	5123126	Thank you for that completely random footnote.
5123446	5126148	Are they, you know, inaction figures?
5126408	5126608	Yes.
5126788	5127248	See what I mean?
5127408	5127728	Nerds!
5127929	5128269	All of you!
5128469	5128769	Nerds!
5129749	5129929	What?
5130510	5134952	No, no, you want to talk about nerds, it's a conversation that Extrovert and I had at Lions about glamour.
5136309	5138031	I know, I know.
5138091	5143476	Here we are all sitting on the radio show we've been doing about DDR for the past three and a half years.
5144697	5157290	Anyway, I'm curious also, I have to let you go soon because we're still getting a bunch of other calls, but what I want to ask you about real quick, as somebody who reviews games and has been doing it for a little while, what do you think about this whole Xbox 360 thing?
5157470	5158571	Are you going to pick one up at launch?
5159887	5168970	No, I'm not, because for one, I don't like the pricing structure in order to get the good system with the hard drive, I have to drop an extra hundred bucks.
5169770	5181174	And so far, the games, especially the launch window, outside of Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion, there's really not much I'm looking forward to that I can't play on my normal Xbox.
5182075	5182595	There you have it.
5183515	5183835	All right.
5184315	5185936	Well, Amal, thanks so much for calling in.
5186036	5187116	It's really good to hear from you.
5187257	5188237	Don't be a stranger, all right?
5189011	5189311	All right.
5189391	5191111	And when's that EX2 review going to be up?
5193272	5196013	Hopefully during this week, if I can manage it.
5196193	5196453	All right.
5196513	5197013	Sounds good.
5197753	5200574	Elmo from InsidePulse.com, thank you so much for calling in.
5200614	5201314	Have a good week, okay?
5202334	5202634	You too.
5202694	5202894	All right.
5202934	5203114	Later.
5204955	5206095	We're going to go to another call now.
5206175	5208815	Let's go to – I want to pick up somebody new here.
5208855	5210316	This one's been trying to get in for a little while here.
5211056	5212176	Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
5214237	5215477	Oops, did I actually answer the call?
5215517	5215917	Probably not.
5217219	5217479	Hello?
5218260	5219280	Did I pick both of them up?
5220401	5221181	I picked up the wrong one.
5221201	5221582	Oh, that's right.
5221622	5222622	Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.
5224904	5225264	Hello?
5226825	5229586	This is the one whose connection wasn't working quite right earlier.
5230067	5231728	Still can't hear you, buddy.
5231908	5232688	Still can't hear you, buddy.
5232728	5233469	Try it again, alright?
5235510	5236390	Um, let's... Oh, damn.
5236931	5237891	There was the one I was going to pick up.
5237931	5238912	Let's pick up...
5242288	5243228	I don't see that one coming in.
5244789	5245549	Let's pick up this one.
5246410	5247250	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
5249491	5250891	Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
5253632	5253973	Hello?
5254293	5254653	Hello!
5255893	5256233	Hello.
5256374	5256654	Hi!
5259595	5259955	Can you hear me?
5259975	5260075	Hi!
5260235	5260595	Hi!
5260735	5261736	You're on Orange Lounge Radio.
5264117	5267678	Um, I'm... I think...
5268911	5269351	Is this Roz?
5269391	5270171	Massive lag.
5270572	5271532	No, this isn't Roz.
5271592	5272392	This is somebody else.
5272612	5272992	Hello?
5273193	5274873	Hi, I think there's massive lag.
5274933	5275753	What's on your mind?
5275934	5278194	And we'll answer your question or whatever's on your mind.
5278234	5278775	Tell us what's up.
5282196	5284377	We have to wait a little bit for the lag here.
5284577	5285497	Let's see what this person has to say.
5285517	5285857	Hi.
5286017	5286257	Hi.
5289018	5291079	Well, is it working?
5292339	5293300	Yes, it's working.
5293340	5294400	Hurry up and ask your question.
5294440	5294940	What's on your mind?
5295200	5296061	Just ask your question.
5296101	5296421	What's up?
5297898	5300741	Well, I don't play music games that much.
5301141	5301441	Uh-huh.
5302963	5308588	But... But I don't... So I don't know what you're talking about.
5309693	5312036	Well, this is Orange Lounge Radio.
5312136	5320745	Our Sunday night program was actually, the station kind of started, it has to do with, you know, because the name Orange Lounge actually comes from music-based video games.
5320785	5327091	And that's kind of how we grew into kind of what we're doing here is that we started by talking about music video games.
5327131	5331796	So this Sunday night show that we do is kind of a throwback to the music
5332697	5333237	Thanks for watching!
5353663	5354064	Thanks for watching!
5373783	5374183	DarkSakura
5404005	5406207	Hello, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.
5406988	5407469	Can you hear us?
5408630	5410352	Turn down your speakers.
5410432	5412614	If you can hear us, we cannot hear you, my friend.
5412654	5413315	Wait, wait, wait.
5413896	5415017	I'm going to send an IM real quick.
5415782	5416822	Okay.
5416842	5419304	Just a reminder, because we had a lot of new people calling in tonight.
5419784	5421465	Maybe somebody can post this in the chat room as well.
5422285	5425586	The first time, before the first time you call, it's always a good idea to call.
5425886	5427687	It's a username on Skype, Echo123.
5428348	5434090	And then that way you can test your connection and see if you can hear yourself, because that's a really good way to test the connection.
5434530	5436211	Let me try one more time here.
5436411	5436911	Are you there?
5437972	5438372	Can you hear us?
5440711	5441191	Hello!
5441491	5441852	Hi!
5442272	5442692	Who's this?
5444093	5444913	Um, this is Roz.
5445133	5445773	Hi Roz!
5445853	5446514	What's on your mind?
5449555	5450716	Yeah, just fine.
5452616	5453217	How you doing?
5453617	5454998	Do you got a question for us?
5455158	5456218	What are you calling in about tonight?
5456238	5456778	You can't hear us.
5458399	5459099	You can't hear me.
5459119	5460460	I can hear you.
5462021	5462121	Oh.
5463880	5466002	Is the call lagged by like 45 seconds?
5466883	5468564	I don't know, maybe we're a little lagged.
5468584	5472827	I think the call was incredibly lagged here because I think she's just now getting the stuff we said in the beginning.
5473168	5474649	Roz, I'm going to have to let you go for right now.
5474689	5477111	I'm really sorry, but try calling us back in a little while.
5477571	5478792	Something's up with the connection tonight.
5479132	5479773	I don't know what's going on.
5479793	5483096	I'm still here, yeah.
5483276	5484116	Maybe she'll get to the question.
5486118	5487900	The question part should be coming up now on the call.
5488760	5490041	Live radio, everybody.
5490522	5493324	Yeah, she's getting lagged.
5493527	5494808	Okay, I figure it's probably really lagged.
5500675	5505300	Okay, we're going to have to go ahead and let Roz go for right now, but hopefully she'll give us a call back a little later in the program.
5506001	5507522	Let's try to go to this call.
5507642	5509945	Remember guys, Echo 1-2-3, unfortunately lagged.
5509965	5512888	There's not a whole lot we can do about, but we'll give it a try.
5513469	5514330	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
5515518	5515878	Oh, hi.
5516219	5516559	Hi.
5517660	5520642	Hold on, I'm getting an echo because I'm still listening to your show.
5520662	5521343	That's all right.
5521743	5522784	Luckily, we don't hear it.
5522864	5527127	And I'm very happy that we're picking up a call that's unlagged and we can hear the person just fine.
5527548	5528068	It's all good.
5528148	5530030	So go ahead and turn that down.
5530150	5531131	And what's on your mind?
5533653	5533853	Um...
5535740	5536581	Actually, I don't really know.
5537222	5538363	Okay, well, who's this?
5538443	5539204	Introduce yourself.
5540725	5542947	This is Xander from Florida.
5542967	5544008	Hi, Xander.
5545450	5546351	Hi, Xander from Florida.
5547051	5549153	Yeah, there's a massive time difference.
5549214	5550175	It's like 11 o'clock here.
5550575	5551856	I'm staying up way past my bedtime.
5552577	5553077	I know.
5553438	5558583	We really kind of screw over our East Coast fans with the timing of this show, but the problem is that, you know...
5560164	5565825	We're all people that work during the week, Monday through Friday, so Saturday and Sunday are kind of like our days off.
5565885	5573166	So if we were to do our show at like 4.30 or a time that would cater more to the East Coast folks, we would pretty much be losing a day of our weekend.
5573226	5575607	So that's unfortunately why we have to do it early.
5575627	5577967	I mean, later on.
5578147	5579968	And we aren't paid well enough to do it early.
5579988	5581568	Yeah, we don't get paid for this crap either.
5582928	5587529	But of course, that's another reason why we do the podcast, is so that folks can download that whenever they want.
5588789	5590793	So, I'm assuming you heard about the show through the podcast?
5592155	5594699	Um, no, actually, I heard about it through DDR Freak.
5594939	5601230	Oh, right on, okay, yeah, we got a lot of folks from DDR Freak, because, you know, people whore... I haven't warned you for anything yet, have I?
5602768	5603608	No, actually, I don't.
5603708	5604569	I'm not on the forums.
5604669	5605329	I just, you know.
5605569	5606009	Okay.
5606029	5606809	He's a lurker.
5606869	5607670	I will if you want me to.
5607910	5608650	He's a lurker.
5608750	5609270	He's a voyeur.
5609290	5610111	He just watches.
5610131	5611111	That's awesome.
5611151	5612331	I'm a lurker on a lot of stuff.
5612592	5613072	That's good.
5613132	5613432	All right.
5613572	5614992	Yay, we have a stalker.
5617353	5619154	I wanted to talk to Jamie about in the group.
5619714	5621655	Okay, uh-oh, uh-oh, I'm in trouble.
5621795	5623336	Alright, what's up?
5624216	5632621	Okay, um, I'm a big fan of In The Groove, and I would say that you are massively wrong in saying that it is a rip-off.
5632841	5635562	Um, let me finish, let me finish.
5635802	5636022	Yes?
5637263	5637823	Go ahead.
5638003	5640345	Yeah, I find it much more fun than DDR.
5640585	5641565	How is it not a rip-off?
5643086	5646468	Well... And I want examples, item by item.
5647588	5648849	Hold on, let the man finish his thoughts.
5651481	5655705	What is more fun for you for In The Groove as opposed to DDR?
5655785	5660970	Once I got to about the 9-footers in DDR, it got kind of boring for me because it just kind of stagnated.
5668537	5674500	at that point, and then the 10s, there's too much of a gap between the 9s and the 10s, so it's too hard to get into, like, the max and stuff.
5675420	5684424	So, I found within the groove, you have much harder 9s on Expert, and easier 10s, so the gap is kind of closed, and I can have a lot more fun in between.
5685184	5690807	Which is basically where I am, so... Just out of curiosity, do you play on controller or play on actual dance pad?
5691287	5694008	No, I play on the dance mat.
5694408	5695349	What dance mat are you using?
5696569	5700153	The Red Octane, the foam mat.
5700573	5701834	Okay, my Ignition 3.0.
5702795	5703095	Ignition 3.0.
5703456	5704176	No, 2.0.
5704977	5705437	Oh, 2.0.
5705637	5719470	Okay, so for you, the thing that makes In The Groove a little more exciting than DDR is the fact that there's more middle ground, like 9.5 level step patterns, that some of the step patterns cater more to an advanced level.
5720498	5722100	Right, and Charlene's awesome.
5722540	5724542	That's never been my point.
5724582	5728305	My point is that it took something and basically stole the idea.
5729346	5733870	I'm very much one for innovation, and there is no innovation.
5733910	5735051	They basically took the DDR.
5735071	5736352	They have the hands and the minds.
5737361	5741863	And they're willing to do much harder songs than Konami was ever willing to do with DDR.
5742164	5749207	But the fact remains that you take a game using four arrows that you have to step on in pattern.
5750108	5755450	Are you going to say the same thing about Dragon Warrior and Final Fantasy?
5755590	5758472	I mean, they're the same style of game, but that doesn't mean they're a ripoff of each other.
5760183	5767388	The systems were actually... You can't compare RPGs that come out at the same time.
5767428	5772611	It would be like comparing Grindio with Final Fantasy, even though they have two different combat systems.
5772651	5778856	I've heard a similar argument to this before, and it's saying that you don't say Mario and Sonic is the common one I hear.
5778876	5785160	But for me, honestly, Mario and Sonic is not the accurate comparison when it comes to In the Groove and DDR for me.
5785200	5788942	It's Mario and this old Commodore 64 game called The Great Gianna Sisters,
5790383	5796065	was an awful lot like Mario Brothers, except they had like a couple, it was girls, and there was a couple extra things in it.
5796125	5798226	It's like in here, Sonic and Jazz Jackrabbit.
5798986	5799287	Okay?
5799827	5811411	But the whole fact of the matter remains, and this is why to this day I will be against in the group, was the fact that they were saying, hey, take DDR machines and modify them.
5811931	5812732	You know, let's break...
5813932	5816034	That's why they have the dedicated cabinets now for In The Groove 2.
5816554	5825301	Right, they have that now, but the whole fact remains that the origin of In The Groove was a rip-off and modification of DDR.
5826061	5826962	And what about Step Mania?
5827742	5829544	Step Mania was never marketed for sale.
5831110	5833672	In the Groove is kind of Stepmania marketed for sale in a way.
5833712	5834732	You could argue that.
5834813	5842519	Had Stepmania been released as an item for sale, which is why I was against those kits that they were selling on eBay, the same thing.
5842999	5844020	It is a ripoff.
5844280	5847983	It is stealing proprietary information from Konami.
5850285	5851446	That is where my point is.
5852006	5857211	And to this day, I will consider In the Groove a cheap knockoff because they will not admit their fault.
5857810	5868608	Despite the fact, now to play devil's advocate here with our caller a little bit, despite the fact that In The Groove might have some more challenging steps and songs that appeal to a different audience.
5870155	5874517	I will give it that it's got interesting stuff, although the earlier level steps were actually complete crap.
5875417	5876597	I do like some of the music better.
5878358	5883620	The only reason that I didn't play anything harder on In the Groove when I played it is I was fresh off of a car accident.
5884420	5888741	You know, I was having this issue with my hip pointing to dislocate itself every time I stepped funny.
5890102	5891962	So I didn't get a chance to try anything harder.
5892002	5893943	I'm not saying it's not a fun game.
5894443	5896064	I'm not saying it doesn't offer challenge.
5896224	5899305	My whole point comes with the origin of the game, and that's why I'm against it.
5899625	5903149	I don't believe in thievery in the industry Why don't you like the game?
5915183	5916023	What I don't like about the game?
5916163	5918024	First off, the interface is extremely plain.
5918044	5921826	It looks like whoever made the skin crapped it out in about five minutes.
5922026	5923447	The songs are all very generic.
5923507	5926568	They sound very alike, and it's just really generic sounding stuff.
5927268	5928349	The step patterns suck.
5928429	5929069	I don't like them.
5929769	5933691	I don't like the fact that there are hands and feet, or whatever, you know, the hands part of it.
5934051	5934611	It's retarded.
5934711	5936152	I don't like the feet, Loki.
5936252	5942436	I was kind of against the whole involvement of the eye toy for DDR.
5942456	5946018	I'm talking about the three steps at once, or the four steps at once.
5946118	5946778	It's retarded.
5946878	5947979	It's just like, pump it up.
5948099	5950080	Yeah, and I hate it in Pump It Up.
5950240	5951921	I hate Pump It Up, the way they have that.
5952361	5958605	Although I like, you know what, I really, really like that recent pump release for Home because it's an awesome dance game, it really is.
5958965	5963947	But still, some of the steps in Pump It Up are just as asinine as Paranoia Survivor Max or The Water.
5963967	5966509	All I said was it didn't look like they put that much polish in it.
5967089	5967409	That's it.
5967549	5970471	And in the group too, I'm sorry, they didn't put that much polish into that one either.
5970511	5971692	They just changed the interface.
5971732	5980997	Yeah, I could have also made a better cover with an afternoon in Illustrator with my, like, all of, you know, five week skill in Illustrator than they did.
5981317	5981938	To each his own.
5981958	5983579	I mean, I don't care if you play the game.
5983639	5985500	I think it's cool if you're supporting another company.
5985580	5986481	Hey, you know what?
5986601	5993767	There needs to be more dancing games out there, and just maybe deviate a little bit more from DDR than you did before.
5993947	5995908	I know what will make everybody happy.
5995968	5998030	We have DDR Food Mix.
5998450	6003754	They just hire the Food Mix people and say, make us a DDR mix and market that, and then everyone will be happy.
6003794	6004655	But it'd still be a rip-off.
6005396	6006437	I said Konami needs to.
6006977	6009099	It's a rip-off within the same company, though.
6009139	6010220	That's kind of her point.
6011300	6013822	But if Konami releases it, it's not a rip-off.
6013902	6015523	I miss the Konami doing it part.
6015543	6017305	Because it's Konami's intellectual property.
6018025	6021848	Alright, this discussion's been going on an awful long time.
6021888	6027072	All I want is for the in-the-group fans to admit that it's a rip-off.
6028359	6029540	I completely respect your opinion, by the way.
6045731	6046391	All right, that's good.
6046591	6047392	Even if I disagree.
6047752	6048552	All right, later, dude.
6049673	6049973	All right.
6050853	6051494	Very interesting.
6051814	6054135	I'm just like, you know, I just don't care.
6054575	6054895	I don't.
6055415	6056976	But honestly, it's the same.
6057016	6059337	I'm not even adamant about pointing out that it's a ripoff.
6059357	6059857	Who cares?
6060418	6060798	Who cares?
6060878	6065620	That's actually all I care about is people admitting that they basically stole.
6065900	6067961	Well, it should all come out in the courts pretty soon.
6068061	6072224	Well, not pretty soon, but... Yeah, as soon as Rockstar gets the Smackdown laid on him, sure.
6072724	6073945	Alright, new topic, new topic.
6073965	6076346	Let's see if our next call... I'm going to try this guy one more time here.
6076366	6077947	Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.
6078148	6080309	Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.
6080329	6083731	I'm not even adamant about, like, pointing out... Feedback!
6084131	6085292	We got really bad feedback there.
6085312	6086573	Turn down your speakers.
6087053	6088754	Hello?
6088995	6089255	Hello?
6089815	6090135	Yeah.
6090896	6092217	Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.
6092677	6094118	Yeah, you guys are really choppy.
6095570	6096051	It happens.
6096131	6097772	Skype is really weird.
6098132	6099273	Alright.
6100253	6102394	Yeah, hey, first time caller.
6104436	6105576	What's on your mind, my friend?
6105596	6105897	Alright.
6105917	6107258	Main reason I called in...
6112532	6127553	Assuming that I don't win an Xbox 360 from the whole Mountain Dew, Pepsi, win an Xbox 360 every 10 minutes thing that I've been religiously collecting money for, should I sell my PSP?
6128240	6130881	to help fund an Xbox 360 in your opinion?
6132242	6139644	We're going to have to hang up on you because of the feedback, but keep listening.
6140765	6146327	Alright, so keep listening because we're going to get to this guy's call here, and we're just getting really bad feedback on that call, but we want to answer the question.
6146367	6153450	So the question was, assuming that I cannot win an Xbox 360 through the every 10 minutes competition that's going on, which
6154410	6156793	You're not going to win one.
6156853	6159556	If you do win one, hats off to you.
6159917	6162940	Every nerd drinks Mountain Dew unless they're on a diet.
6163340	6167565	I'm a nerd and I don't drink Mountain Dew because I think it tastes like pee.
6167585	6172291	You have a better chance of getting a 360 doing one of those referral programs than you would doing the...
6172751	6175832	You have a better chance of getting a 360 by saving up the money and buying one.
6175852	6177093	Not to knock it, though, dude.
6177353	6179674	If you're going to try that way, have fun with it.
6179774	6183095	And Mountain Dew, I like Mountain Dew, but it's too many calories for me.
6183415	6184775	How dumb do I sound?
6184795	6189417	But back to the subject, the thing is, should he sell his PSP to get an Xbox 360?
6189957	6194799	I think that you should sell your PSP to get a Turbo Express, because Better Games came out on the Turbo Duo.
6196620	6199441	No, they need to bring back my LiveWire, because I love that.
6200122	6201925	I don't want to drink Shasta.
6213800	6216682	Should I sell a PSP to get an Xbox 360?
6217042	6221546	Here's the golden rule of gaming, and we've said this if you're going to judge a system time and time again.
6222006	6225328	A system is only as good as the games that they put out on it.
6225989	6226850	I have always said that.
6226950	6231053	I know you have, and I'm repeating it because it's the golden rule of gaming, and I say apply it here.
6231693	6233354	Look at the games that are coming out for Xbox 360.
6234455	6235677	Are you into racing games?
6235797	6237099	Are you into sports games?
6237219	6238821	Is Gun something that interests you?
6238881	6240824	Is Dead or Alive series something that interests you?
6241285	6244870	If these are games that interest you, Xbox 360 is the way to go.
6246076	6264694	If, on the other hand, you're more into the types of things you can do on a handheld and the things that are going to be coming out for PSP, if you want the new Katamari PSP game, if you want Metal Gear Acid 2 and the tactical games and more portable things, and you like to watch movies on the go, then PSP is more for you.
6265635	6270799	So, while we can kind of make a decision based on what our preference would be,
6272633	6273913	Honestly, I couldn't decide.
6274934	6298260	Honestly, if this were me, if I were absolutely poor and I had no way to afford these games right now, I didn't have a job, I was unemployed, so I had to cut back on my gaming, regardless or not, like it or not, I would probably hold on to my PSP for right now and stick it out a little bit longer because there's really nothing that's coming out for the 360 for me right now that's making me go, oh my gosh,
6298800	6300101	I have to have this right now.
6300121	6304965	And what if you get the 360 and then the PS3 comes out and you're like, oh crap, I wanted to get that instead.
6305125	6305485	Exactly.
6305525	6308307	You know, I would wait until this stuff comes out.
6308548	6311510	I mean, honestly, it doesn't look like there's that much stuff coming at launch.
6312677	6314639	and just stick with the PSP for now.
6315119	6318862	Especially if you're going to invest in the 360, you're going to be investing quite a bit of money.
6318882	6319863	You know what, that's a really good idea.
6321024	6327590	When the Xbox 360 comes out and you can play this at GameStop, EB Games, your favorite retailer, play the demos, maybe you can make a better decision at that point.
6327850	6331953	There's no reason you have to get a 360 the day it comes out unless...
6332793	6334134	There's just this game you're dying for.
6334295	6338739	Also, I personally do not advocate trading in your systems or games unless the game is crap.
6339560	6348970	For the simple reason, I often find moments where like, oh, I want to play this game and I'll go bust out the Neo Geo and freaking play King of Fighters 2000.
6349931	6353255	How many people do we know that has sold back a system and then had to buy it again later?
6354327	6356490	I know many, many folks.
6357271	6358011	I've done it myself.
6358091	6366481	And we ourselves, the only system that we have actually ever gotten rid of was our Nintendo 64, and we are borrowing somebody else's.
6367415	6369938	So, I mean, it doesn't really matter.
6370318	6384695	You know, there's been days where we've broken out the ColecoVision and freaking had a golf fest or played Venture, you know, only to put it up, you know, an hour later and break out the TurboGrafx and play a bunch of bonks.
6384895	6386176	I think that's another good element to look at.
6386216	6390120	If you're going to sell that PSP back, think to yourself, am I going to regret this later?
6390180	6395024	Is there going to be a game coming out for PSP that I'm going to really, really want later?
6395825	6397506	What the hell else is coming out on PSP?
6398187	6400209	Loki, what are some of the big games coming out for PSP?
6401687	6405289	That's a good one.
6405309	6408851	Ooh, the gauntlet has been thrown in the chat room.
6409091	6409611	Oh, what happened?
6410072	6411392	I have to label off my systems now.
6411792	6412053	Oh, okay.
6412633	6413313	Alright, anyway.
6415434	6418516	Before you sell back your PSP, make sure it's something you're not going to regret later on with the games.
6418716	6421838	So, that's our really, really long-winded answer to your question.
6421878	6426460	I hope you're able to still listen, and sorry we had to let you go there, but we were just getting too much feedback.
6426560	6427741	Skype is being retarded today.
6427761	6429382	Skype is being very bad tonight, so...
6429482	6431123	Skype, Skype, I'm punishing Skype.
6431303	6433244	I'm not punishing our listeners, but I'm punishing Skype.
6433724	6436226	And we're going to sign into Do Not Disturb for a little while.
6436406	6437286	That was the last Skype word.
6437566	6437747	Huh?
6440468	6440708	All right.
6441409	6444810	So, again, if you want to give us feedback, you can always send us an email.
6445131	6448472	You can always join our chat room, and we always try to get to this stuff on the show.
6448873	6450894	www.orangeontrade.com, click on chat.
6451254	6454396	I'd really like to hear from this guy what he thought of our feedback there.
6455396	6456257	And, of course, our forums.
6457217	6463241	I know I've been searching those forums non-stop lately on OrangeLunchRadio.com, and there's been some pretty neat posts and some good questions asked.
6463601	6468404	And I, you know, if I'm bored, I always take time to state my opinion there on the forums.
6468844	6471546	So check that out as well on OrangeLunchRadio.com.
6472387	6472647	All right.
6474628	6479871	And some folks in the chat room are crying because they didn't get through on Skype line, so we're really sorry, but we are punishing Skype for a little while.
6480171	6482773	If we have some extra time at the end of the show, we'll come back to Skype, okay?
6482833	6483273	We promise.
6483774	6485775	But for now, we're long overdue for a break, you guys.
6486513	6492921	So we're going to go to a break, and in this break, I think we're going to play something from... Oh, I don't know.
6492961	6496746	How about an Outphase song from Beatmania 2DX?
6496766	6498448	I haven't heard this in a long time.
6498468	6501232	So we'll be back with more Orange Launch Radio after this, you guys.
6501612	6501993	Stay tuned.
6605626	6607949	Thank you for watching!
6633191	6635845	Thank you for watching
6677349	6691361	Don't give away everything you own Someone will give you back the innocence that you have lost Charlie, if you're getting a sister of mine Better stay off the drugs and the wine Don't get lost in the day
6724232	6725615	Thank you for watching
6760686	6762095	Thanks for watching!
6799649	6800592	Thanks for watching!
6832609	6833389	Thanks for watching!
6861609	6864674	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6902186	6902989	Thanks for watching!
6954148	6959954	Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.
6964431	6966492	Hello, we're back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
6966532	6970654	In that break, you heard a little bit of Summer Vacation there from 2DX6Style.
6971214	6978857	Charlene from In The Groove, because, you know, a big part of that last segment, we were talking to an In The Groove fan who wanted to discuss with Jamie the pros and cons there.
6979377	6982158	And they said they liked Charlene, and a lot of our chatroom likes that song, too.
6982218	6984999	So we thought we'd nod those folks with that.
6986080	6989781	Also, V, as requested by our chatroom about a gazillion times there.
6989841	6993663	So there you go, some V. The perennially whored Bomani song.
6994864	6994904	D.R.
6994924	6996006	Max, America Max 2
7008134	7008734	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
7036380	7040301	and of course now three of the four of us sitting in the room right now have been to E3 before.
7040401	7040881	Sorry, Bugs.
7040901	7041842	I plan on going this year.
7042102	7042822	Are you going to go this year?
7043482	7043702	Rad?
7044022	7044703	Well, Bug?
7045043	7045583	Get Bug to mic.
7045603	7048104	Give me the damn mic.
7048424	7049444	Yes, I do plan on going this year.
7049504	7050884	My roommate has gone for the past four years.
7051044	7051345	Oh, right on.
7053542	7054422	and many more.
7069108	7074109	I went for swag my first year And to give away to friends But going to sell is not cool
7098208	7101310	But last year it was all like, okay, I can't carry this crap around.
7102511	7108995	And my goal, my first goal, the first year I went was actually for media kits.
7109655	7116340	My second year was media kits and getting into media events, which I succeeded in.
7116880	7125566	Overpopulation, of course, my god, E3 was so crowded this year, it's not even funny, which of course ties back into the food lines, are god awful at E3.
7130267	7154963	I think next year somebody I had ways around that too somebody would be really smart to open up a hot dog stand out front like 50 of them or not just hot dog stands but permits how about a salad they were chasing off folks with hot dog stands because they didn't have permits for sale that is such BS actually it's law well I understand it's the law but come on you've got all those people packed in that tiny building and they're trying to eat for God's sake and to make them pay $10 for a hamburger is insane
7155743	7157004	So, shame on them.
7158284	7160525	Or at least somebody go get a permit then and make it legal.
7161326	7165588	How about instead of like hot dog carts, how about a salad cart or something healthy for these people?
7166368	7167089	Which includes me.
7167189	7167849	The fruit cart.
7168009	7168569	The fruit cart.
7168589	7169430	How about some hot fruit?
7172344	7175166	I can't be the only hot fruit at E3, come on.
7176146	7177347	Media, media, media.
7177667	7181229	Everything is all media-centric, which some argue is the way it needs to be.
7181369	7186052	Of course, the Rockstar booth this year was shit unless you were in the media.
7186733	7189254	You couldn't do anything at that booth unless you were media-oriented.
7189514	7192416	Some people say that one day of E3 needs to be nothing but media.
7193537	7195938	Be very interesting, nonetheless.
7196638	7198219	Sexploitation of E3.
7199500	7204444	The fact that it's booth babes, booth babes, booth babes, and then just random girls walking around.
7204464	7205745	Look at this place.
7205945	7206165	Nope.
7206386	7207787	Very, very few booth boys.
7207827	7208287	There's one.
7208948	7209428	Very few.
7209508	7210789	Just at the Barbarians.
7210829	7211410	It was great.
7212010	7213111	Well, let's face it, though.
7213251	7217895	The statistics are that, you know, most of the E3... The Bacon Dogs were awesome.
7218616	7220397	Most of the... That was a random comment.
7220937	7224540	Most of the E3 is very male-dominated.
7224560	7226942	But at the same time, I see a lot, a lot more women.
7226962	7228844	There's more women that go to that show than you'd think.
7230097	7234642	You know, so I'm kind of surprised they don't have more booth dudes, or whatever you want to call them, booth hunks.
7234822	7236223	I got interviewed by IGN.
7236764	7236984	What?
7237104	7238385	I got interviewed by IGN.
7239046	7240087	As like a gamer girl, right?
7240107	7240928	As a gamer girl.
7240968	7241148	Yeah.
7241168	7246253	I was like, do you consider yourself a gamer girl?
7246774	7249657	No, I only host internet radio about video games.
7252045	7253767	I'm sorry, you're not a true gaming girl.
7253787	7257691	You have not licked a PSP.
7257711	7261316	I am older school than old school.
7263418	7266742	People that camp and play the demos all day long.
7268479	7272322	Well, I realize this, but I'm talking about the one particular demo.
7273143	7279067	What's a game that people were doing this on at this year's E3 that people would just not get off those damn demos no matter what?
7279688	7281269	Not really so much Katamari, actually.
7281649	7284552	The way the Katamari demo was set up, it was very hard to camp that demo.
7285212	7287914	I'm trying to think of a demo that was really badly camped.
7288315	7290797	Soul Calibur III was pretty bad.
7291977	7292558	So, I don't know.
7292578	7293659	There's other ones, too.
7294082	7304025	Well, in the year before that, I would say probably Contra, the Contra game, and... Oh, I don't even remember the other one now.
7306666	7312568	Cattle Pods and Timed Electrical Pulses will... Although some people might get to like that.
7313008	7317130	Shuttle Delays, so it makes it very hard to get to the damn show, I agree with that one.
7317930	7318030	Um...
7319366	7322868	The sound, the fact that the sound is very, very loud there.
7324109	7325890	Have you ever been to any other type of conference?
7325910	7327971	I got to touch the Katamari and that made me happy.
7328672	7335476	The fact that the lines are incredibly long and you never really necessarily know what they're for in some cases.
7337777	7340939	And sometimes the lines are to just walk through a room.
7341479	7345762	The article says, The line at Nintendo is for a screening at Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess.
7346102	7348784	They'd just shown the trailer at the press conference the day before.
7350148	7361013	and then the line at Sony was to walk through a room where they had hallow models of the PlayStation 3 design behind glass two days before they'd released high-res images of the system anyway.
7361113	7362534	Were you supposed to kneel down in reverence?
7363394	7368476	Hey, I'm not going to say anything because we had those pictures up as soon as we were back.
7370297	7377580	Here's their suggestions, and then we'll wrap this up and get into other segments here because I know maybe some people are like, well, what the hell do I care?
7377620	7378301	I don't get to go to E3.
7378321	7378381	Huh?
7379944	7382005	I know, we'll get to that.
7383366	7384947	Suggestions on how to make E3 better.
7385267	7386988	Tighten the entrance requirements.
7389389	7393491	It's saying if you work at a Hollywood video store, you shouldn't be coming in.
7393591	7396492	If you draw an online comic strip, you shouldn't be coming in.
7396552	7402035	If you're from blogger.com and you occasionally talk about games, you shouldn't be coming in.
7403573	7412781	If you just really want to get into E3 because you want to play upcoming games, you're part of the problem, says this site, article.gaminghorizon.com.
7413081	7414922	I'm not sure if that's the best way to phrase it.
7415903	7421508	If you work at Target in the garden department, just because Target carries games, you shouldn't be going to E3.
7421548	7428233	I think you have to play the upcoming games so you can tell other people about them, so yes, that is part of the reason why you play, but anyway.
7429695	7430976	A Media Only Day...
7431792	7432833	I don't know if that's the answer.
7433053	7435014	I think the media gets too much favoritism as it is.
7435134	7437635	If they would just tighten up who they let in in general.
7437835	7442718	Yeah, but the media, the hype that the media generates is part of what sells the games.
7443078	7451483	I understand that, but I just... Part of what... True, you've got to cater to the fan base, but it is a media event.
7451743	7452923	It is an industry event.
7452983	7454444	It's an industry event, not a media event.
7454464	7455024	There's a difference.
7455385	7456145	It's an industry event.
7456165	7457746	But I do think the media should get a difference.
7458851	7460632	They're the ones who are actually reporting on it.
7460692	7464294	They should be getting the information before the average consumer.
7464634	7466735	What about like a manager of a GameStop who's not the media?
7467895	7469356	Then they need to be shown some credentials.
7469416	7470957	I think that they should get into that too.
7471357	7480781	But I'm saying the average GameStop employee, the average Target employee, the people who do a webcomic.
7481342	7486464	I think if you report on it or if you are in charge of a group that is selling it,
7488015	7490097	Less babes, more games Streamline the press conferences
7507197	7517544	The one thing about the press they were saying is no love for the small press like us because G4 and IGN bring like 5,000 people to those things.
7517684	7518925	They whore out everything.
7519165	7529452	It's like Joe Bob who actually has a website that's pretty popular but not as popular as these can't get into anything because they're being whored out.
7529632	7530473	It's like, who are you?
7530793	7533155	We don't know who you are so fuck off, you know.
7534336	7537798	and no behind closed doors only content.
7538178	7539078	I have to agree with that one.
7539098	7539338	I agree.
7539358	7542400	That's a bunch of crap, keeping the stuff behind closed doors.
7542440	7546941	Just don't show it at all.
7547562	7549262	Fix the demo camper problem.
7550003	7553944	I'd just have those demos reset after like three minutes or say, time's up, get off my game.
7555265	7556305	Watch the volume.
7557066	7559607	Figure out what's secret and what's public.
7560529	7563951	have operational press sites running alongside the show.
7564251	7564952	That's kind of interesting.
7565472	7568834	And the last one, which I think is very interesting, have an East Coast show.
7570675	7570835	No.
7571896	7577799	Actually, I thought that Microsoft did their Xbox 360 demo very intelligently.
7578059	7578760	They had a ticket.
7579921	7583182	You go up, get your ticket, you come back at the time for the ticket, and they let you in.
7583222	7584103	That's a Squeenix thing.
7585024	7587005	Yeah, that was pretty smart, too.
7587245	7588125	I mean, I think it was very...
7589306	7594807	You know, although you do have to wait for your turn, but it prevents them from being the insane line.
7595107	7600769	Okay, it did actually prevent the line at Squinnix, but it did prevent the lines for the 360.
7602129	7605069	You had your line formed at the time it was to let them in.
7605490	7607370	You get inside, no more line.
7607390	7609250	You don't have to worry about the congestion of people.
7609370	7610251	It was very smart.
7611051	7616072	You know, I even think that they should have, this is like what they do with Anime Expo.
7616872	7627894	You know, if you're staying in the convention center hotels or the ones associated with the convention, then as part of, you know, you can go pick up a ticket when you prove that you're staying at one of these places.
7628514	7635116	Or, you know, because that will, you know, generate a little bit more money for both the hotel and, you know, and for the convention itself.
7635956	7645098	But it also prevents, you know, there from being huge congested amounts of people if you have your ticket sales done in a more out of the way location.
7646709	7649910	A lot of our chat room is really big on the East Coast idea.
7650090	7660112	I think because of E3 getting overcrowded and over-bloated in a way, I think some of these East Coast shows are starting to pick up the slack a little bit, just naturally.
7660312	7665693	People are calling this digital live show that's coming up the East Coast E3, and that's just kind of a natural evolution.
7665773	7672215	There are very few, as far as I can know, there aren't as many game companies out on the East Coast as there are on the West Coast.
7673035	7673515	That's very true.
7674151	7678935	and it's significantly easier for, you know, basically L.A.
7678975	7682839	is a local show for everyone in... But most of them are in the bay.
7682919	7684320	Well, I guess maybe not.
7684400	7685821	It's still only four hours.
7685861	7688944	That's better than four days of having to transport stuff.
7689004	7692207	Four hours, you know, you can go home for a day, you know, if you fly.
7692787	7695329	You can go down and up every morning if you have to.
7697111	7698852	All right, we're going to move on real quick.
7700052	7700433	DarkSakura
7727148	7727468	Thank you.
7728409	7730591	More food vendors is my thing.
7730631	7731231	More food vendors.
7731271	7735514	That is stupid that I'm losing an hour and a half of playing game time because I'm standing in line for food.
7735575	7736155	That's awful.
7736455	7739317	I seriously need to stop being run into by famous people.
7740678	7741839	And closed door stuff should not.
7742500	7742620	No.
7742760	7743901	That's not the reason you're there.
7743961	7745902	You're there to show stuff, not show stuff.
7746623	7750546	But it's just to build the excitement about it by making it some secret deal.
7750706	7752988	The biggest problem with E3 is they let Sinbad in.
7753786	7754448	and Gary Coleman.
7754508	7757757	Hey, John Cena was there last year and he's pretty hot.
7758679	7762008	Alright kids, we're going to get into the Orange Lounge Radio cage match or we're going to run out of time.
7763697	7766538	The way the cage match works is that we play three songs for you guys.
7766578	7771720	We play a clip of the song that won last week and then two new songs, each host, of course, bringing one song to the table.
7772160	7773400	You guys vote on your favorite.
7773440	7780963	The winning song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's Bomani and video game music program, which plays 24 hours a day, seven days a week on the station.
7781043	7782203	We are not live.
7782663	7787205	Starting it off tonight is last week's winner, now going for its third win, I believe, if I'm not mistaking.
7788165	7789806	It's something Loki picked a while back.
7789906	7792867	It's a remix of V by Doresia.
7793547	7794207	is the artist.
7794588	7796128	So it's won for the past two weeks.
7796188	7797229	Will it win again tonight?
7797729	7798930	I just don't know.
7798990	7799770	We'll find out.
7800490	7803632	Here it is, song number one tonight, a clip of last week's winner, V.
7903308	7908891	I turned the mics back on right as you yawned, which was... I didn't have... I was... I was asleep.
7908951	7911272	You're cutting out... I don't know what the hell's wrong with the cord there.
7911312	7911652	Yo!
7911772	7912132	There you are.
7912432	7912672	Alright.
7913373	7915834	I was just... I was just being lulled to sleep.
7916054	7919535	Alright, that was song one, Doresio with V. Will it win for the third week in a row?
7919555	7920116	We'll find out.
7920176	7922757	Two new songs doing... challenging it tonight.
7923357	7929440	Um, the first one is my pick, and, um... I haven't won the cage match in, like, three months.
7930519	7930999	Seriously.
7932420	7933721	I have not won the cage match in three months.
7934021	7936282	So I decided tonight I just wasn't going to pick a song.
7936642	7938423	So I let somebody else pick a song for me.
7939924	7944646	And Miklatov's been begging and begging me for like two months or something to let him put a song in.
7944686	7945446	So here you go.
7945846	7949828	And I swear to God, Miklatov, if this song loses, you never get another one in here.
7949868	7950508	No, I'm just kidding.
7951189	7951789	But here it is.
7952770	7955011	This is a song by a group called Pendulum.
7955631	7957412	And the song is called Hold Your Color.
7958172	7959473	So we'll see what you guys think.
7959533	7960494	Here it is, song number two.
7962515	7966919	So can't forget So can't forget So can't forget So can't forget
7988237	7989098	Thanks for watching!
7989118	7990279	Subscribe for more!
8163579	8164600	Thanks for watching!
8289104	8292006	Song number two in tonight's cage match, Pendulum, Hold Your Color.
8293087	8294789	We're not going to hold back our thoughts any longer.
8294829	8296270	What do you guys think of that, DarkSakura?
8297769	8300391	Um, I like it a lot.
8301152	8306575	I just felt it was a little long and got a little repetitive, but I really do like the song a lot, so it gets an 8.5.
8307296	8307636	Loki.
8307936	8313400	I like the beginning of it, then it just kind of, I don't know, it dropped off in my interest, I guess.
8314281	8314781	Um, so 9.
8316262	8316682	Bugged.
8318463	8319204	Good driving song.
8320385	8320605	About an 8.
8321970	8322991	DarkSakura, which pick first tonight?
8347515	8350136	Um, it's, uh, off the new Enflo album.
8351296	8353857	It's, uh, Enflo Loves Benny K's Taste Your Stuff.
8355277	8356417	Some Enflo tonight.
8356437	8357437	Yep, new Enflo.
8357537	8358538	Alright, new Enflo.
8359418	8360398	Song number three tonight.
8360958	8364819	DarkSakura's pick, Enflo Loves Benny K with Taste Your Stuff.
8375515	8382660	Hey, nobody else Hey, nobody else
8443905	8444747	Thank you for watching!
8515467	8516268	Akihito, Akihito
8542766	8544127	Thank you for watching!
8594256	8612283	Okay, that was song number three in tonight's cage match.
8612503	8615824	Mflow loves Benny K with Taste Your Stuff.
8616304	8617845	Very interesting name for a song there.
8618868	8621730	So let's see, uh, did that leave a good taste or a bad taste in your mouth?
8621770	8622431	DarkSakura?
8622691	8624052	I'm broken, do no wrong, 10.
8624872	8625232	Loki?
8625433	8626854	Were they talking about snowballing?
8627494	8628114	I don't think so.
8628535	8631017	Okay, um, I think it's an 8.
8631497	8633578	I was, they lost me at the meowing.
8634699	8634999	Bugged.
8636320	8637041	Yeah, same thing.
8637761	8638141	Yelling.
8638242	8638642	Alright.
8639422	8640603	I liked it, it was kind of cool.
8641563	8646106	It's weird because whenever I decide to randomly download and upload, I get a really shitty song.
8646406	8650989	Whenever she picks one for Cage Match, it's actually really good and I like them, so go figure.
8651389	8653190	So I like that song, it was cool.
8653250	8655571	It had like a porno beat to it, which was kind of cool.
8655912	8659614	So I give it like an 8.5, maybe 9.
8660554	8661775	I could be talked into a 9.
8661815	8662375	8.5 though for now.
8664079	8666780	Alright, let's recap the three songs you can vote for tonight.
8667241	8682109	Starting off with song number one is Doresia with The... And song number two you can vote for tonight is Pendulum with Hold Your Color.
8690749	8695653	And song number three you can vote for tonight is Mflow Loves Benny K with Taste Your Stuff.
8695673	8698556	Whoa, that's not it.
8699337	8699817	How about this?
8700177	8701078	Let's try this again.
8701218	8702980	Mflow Loves Benny K with Taste Your Stuff.
8711637	8713317	All right, kids, you know what to do.
8713738	8716158	Place vote now.
8716258	8719999	Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.
8720379	8731661	Remember, screaming and hollering in the chat room will not count as a vote, although, you know, you may sway some other people, but I'm not encouraging you people to start flooding the chat room.
8731881	8733601	No flooding.
8734421	8738962	You have to allow them to campaign for a song they might want, but, you know, no flooding.
8739673	8741115	Yeah, the next person who floods me.
8741155	8742036	Yeah, don't flood.
8742737	8743758	Alright, so there you go.
8743798	8746020	Have fun arguing about that.
8746561	8751267	In the meantime, Loki, I'm really curious to hear what's going on in the sim scene.
8751287	8752508	Setmania 3.9, release candidate 4.
8752548	8752808	That's it.
8755987	8756387	That's it?
8756567	8756887	That's it.
8757128	8759088	God damn the Sims team for being slow lately.
8759109	8760569	They really haven't been doing anything lately.
8761190	8761990	Get up off your asses, people.
8762010	8763270	Everybody's on vacation.
8763731	8764931	They're getting... Vacation?
8765011	8766372	It's early October.
8766692	8767152	What are they doing?
8767192	8768633	Going on vacation for Columbus Day?
8768673	8769894	How do I go on vacation?
8770634	8771074	I don't know.
8772515	8781519	All I know is that that release candidate's coming out, and they're promising Set Mania 4 someday, and I think I lost interest, like, what, three years ago when they were on release candidate 3?
8781559	8781779	So, um...
8783877	8810184	Yeah, anyways, um, no, nothing really going on, um, was it, OSC 4, um, the other step file, uh, contest they are in judging right now, and, yeah, and, um, I don't know, oh, I know, um, I was gonna see if, um, the, was it, uh,
8811854	8812735	Thank you for watching!
8829119	8833360	It's down to the final 10, well, 11 actually.
8833660	8835781	How many remixes of 2DX songs are in there?
8836721	8840222	Well, here's the finalists in no particular order.
8840562	8841702	Curious what songs people choose.
8841722	8848164	Din Dan Don, Speed Mix, Lucky Cha Cha Cha, Heaven is a Place on Earth, the Speedo Mix.
8848424	8850344	Isn't Ding Dang Dong a Smile Decay song?
8850504	8850824	I don't know.
8850864	8851925	That last one is Wild Side.
8853325	8857906	Canned Heat by Jamiroquai, Unbalance, Country Roads,
8859293	8866065	Take On Me, Speedo Mix, Bye Bye Bike, Boys and Girls Mix, and Not For Sale.
8870288	8878115	Oh, hooray for you people not- All of which, I might add, they said who made them, so no unbiased judging there.
8879136	8882900	My hat's off, though, for not picking Bomani songs and making steps for them.
8882980	8887064	I think you got bumped down if you did something like that or something.
8887084	8888585	Good, good, because I was sick of seeing those.
8889666	8892248	Although it sounds like a bunch of Dance Mania speed songs are in there.
8893550	8894591	Oh well, what can you do?
8897135	8899998	And of course I'm getting corrected in the chatroom, it's not a SmileDK song.
8900038	8901519	Where the hell have I heard that name before?
8902720	8903320	Ding dang dong.
8903380	8904701	I know I've heard that song name before.
8905682	8907784	Like, it's on a Dance Mania CD, I can swear.
8909266	8910486	Oh well.
8910646	8911027	I don't care.
8912067	8912687	Ugly looking.
8913087	8913387	Alright.
8914808	8917709	I wanted to play this- I feel like I'm going to a Taika Parade all of a sudden.
8918429	8919509	I know, he's still at it.
8919649	8921250	Extaper is still playing Taika.
8921390	8922010	You know what's funny?
8922450	8924591	He bought the game at like 5 o'clock today, okay?
8924951	8931533	He already has told me he's beat the game on easy, which means he's played every song in the game on easy mode now, and now he's going back through on normal mode.
8931633	8931853	Wow.
8934144	8935865	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
8963919	8965920	I swear to god she says fuck me
8991653	8995954	So we're going to listen right now to a little bit of acapella here, Sana, Injection of Love.
8996914	9015257	So you can actually kind of hear the little thuds there in the background, so let's see if we can get into the... You can hear little bits of the music in there because the cancellation is not perfect.
9020902	9022963	It sounds like playing a record backwards, doesn't it?
9024403	9038327	Here it is.
9038907	9043548	When you hear it like that, it doesn't sound like fuck so much, but it definitely sounds like froak me.
9045615	9046996	Gently stroke me.
9047336	9047456	Me.
9047476	9047556	Me.
9047596	9047696	Me.
9047736	9047776	Me.
9047796	9047856	Me.
9047876	9047956	Me.
9047996	9048056	Me.
9048076	9048116	Me.
9048136	9048176	Me.
9048197	9048237	Me.
9071826	9072406	Think about this.
9073467	9086234	If it were written out in Karakana, it would be So try saying really fast and see how it comes out.
9088475	9089056	Fuck me!
9090748	9091488	Wow, you're right.
9091809	9092129	Amazing.
9092149	9102554	But seriously, if you listen to that part again and listen to it as if the whole STR little cluster there is actually three syllables.
9104215	9105776	What is there to stroke on her?
9106957	9107777	Maybe her breast.
9109058	9110479	She wants it gently, whatever.
9112210	9112570	You know what?
9113150	9116372	Froak you, and froak you, and froak you too.
9116412	9117512	Does she have a penis?
9117772	9119933	No, I mean, as far as I know, no.
9120914	9122775	Can you stroke a vagina, Loki?
9122795	9124815	You could, oh god, please don't.
9124915	9126156	You can't really do that.
9126536	9130078	Unless there's some really abnormalities, we're not going to go there.
9130458	9132679	But, um, yeah.
9133319	9135280	I don't think so.
9135954	9141078	All right.
9141659	9144401	Isn't the Clitoris like just another version of a penis?
9144421	9145082	You know what?
9146183	9146623	Never mind.
9147884	9149545	I'll just let that thought answer.
9149685	9150606	This is why you're gay.
9150726	9152388	Just stay gay.
9153048	9153508	Stay gay.
9153749	9157592	Don't try to do things that are outside your... Curiosity is bad.
9157992	9160374	Curiosity led to the founding of countries.
9160694	9161715	No, you're not getting the microphone back.
9161735	9162596	Do they have a flag?
9166614	9168876	No flag, no country, you can't have one.
9168896	9171799	Jamie wants to hear it one more time, and then I swear to God we're dropping this subject forever.
9173300	9174081	Alright, let's see, here we go.
9178505	9178805	See?
9180646	9182268	If you listen to it with that in mind.
9182988	9184790	But then again, you also... Broke off.
9185190	9189294	Here's what we gotta say also, that's not gonna rip her voice exactly how it was.
9189814	9191676	It could've ripped off part of the voice.
9191696	9193918	It didn't rip her voice, it ripped everything else out.
9194315	9198998	Well, it might not have worked just perfectly, because I know when I try to take vocals out of stuff, sometimes you hear echoes in the background.
9199118	9199558	You know what?
9199578	9202139	We could actually run it through our computers and see what happens.
9202199	9203220	Let's try doing this.
9203320	9205081	Let me open up the file here.
9206862	9208403	And then I'm going to make some changes to it.
9210324	9212185	And just kind of, you know, do the cancellation thing.
9213565	9214906	And let's see what it sounds like this time.
9214946	9216847	Let's listen to our version of it.
9218308	9218868	Touch me.
9224485	9226647	Oh, fuck me!
9229609	9230110	Amazing.
9230410	9230870	Amazing.
9232291	9232712	Amazing.
9232812	9233052	See?
9233432	9237335	The original was doctored.
9238216	9239517	The original was doctored.
9245441	9246642	I think we should go to a break now.
9247423	9248564	Oh, wait, not before we get...
9249673	9249873	What?
9250253	9251134	Bleached Katamari.
9252474	9253614	Bleached Katamari?
9253634	9256936	Have I been out of the room too long?
9256996	9258376	You have, you have.
9258496	9262958	But Extrofer, you're back just in time because I'll be damned if we miss this.
9263058	9264459	Please don't play the gay music.
9264899	9265679	You get the gay music.
9265799	9267800	I don't want the gay music.
9269040	9270721	We need Extrofer's movie reveal.
9272068	9273589	I need to choose the music for that.
9273669	9273830	No.
9274330	9274930	Extover.
9276031	9276932	What did you see this week?
9277593	9281556	Well, I saw In Her Shoes yesterday.
9281616	9282497	Isn't that a chick flick?
9283317	9285019	It is not a chick flick.
9285259	9287841	Well, you know, it's a chick flick for gay guys.
9289362	9290243	No, no, no.
9290263	9291644	Does that make it a dick flick?
9292325	9293426	It makes it a dick flick.
9293546	9294547	It makes it a cock flick.
9295455	9296475	So it's like Sex and the City.
9297195	9297656	No, no.
9298096	9307718	It's actually a movie about two sisters who go through some life-altering changes and how they kind of come together.
9308019	9318422	But it's a good movie if you're ever in the process of... Unfortunately, sometimes in your life you may lose friends or you may be in the process of losing friends.
9318922	9323143	And it's a good movie to see when you're in that process.
9323840	9327501	But otherwise, I mean, it's a total conflict.
9331883	9334824	The female listeners of our show, thank you for that analogy.
9335624	9336224	No problem.
9336404	9336845	Thank you.
9338985	9339946	I saw Serenity again.
9340426	9340946	Yay!
9341206	9341946	Talk about that.
9342066	9343447	We have to go see Serenity next week.
9343727	9345087	Let's go see Serenity next week.
9345107	9345527	Let's do it.
9345768	9346568	After Firefly.
9346628	9348028	Somebody needs to go see Serenity.
9348048	9349589	Next Friday, we're going to see Serenity again.
9349609	9350269	I got nine points.
9350289	9350709	Okay, never mind.
9353779	9355020	We kind of spoiled it for Dan.
9356421	9359624	Yeah, we spoiled it for Jamie's husband.
9359724	9361205	Well, don't spoil it for the listeners, please.
9361565	9363727	But how did you spoil it without spoiling it for the listeners?
9363827	9366148	We just mentioned, oh, that's so sad.
9366369	9368250	Yeah, and oh, that's so funny.
9368670	9370792	And oh, that's so sad how that was so funny.
9371452	9376156	And oh, that's so... And the people who have seen it will know what I'm talking about.
9376196	9381740	You have this utter scene of, oh, and even a little bit of laughter, and all of a sudden, bam, dead silence.
9382259	9402512	I know, it was a crazy time Without being a spoiler I'm being corrected by one of our chatters I'm going through trying to tally the cage match votes The Smile DK song is Ding Ding Dong Not Ding Dang Dong Okay people, do you see how I got confused?
9402692	9411157	Come on, it was one vowel Here's your Serenity spoiler, by the way Thank you, Goggle, by the way The Reavers all put on tutus and do the hokey pokey in roller skates
9412745	9413865	and NYP and Bowls.
9415246	9416046	You guys are weird.
9416166	9417626	Do you still have your icons on your computer?
9418807	9424848	No, I deleted all those folders that you placed on my computer last week with the... Which makes me want to put some more on there.
9425028	9425628	I don't think so.
9425648	9428929	So what are we going to say about Serenity being in 9th place, huh?
9429549	9430990	Yeah, Serenity was in 9th place.
9431050	9432170	How much money has it made so far?
9432630	9434870	About 17 point something million dollars.
9434910	9436611	Serenity needs to make $80,000 so we get a sequel.
9436651	9436611	$80,000? $80,000.
9441974	9444376	Everyone needs to see Serenity a bajillion times.
9444416	9447218	So declares me.
9463220	9469464	To imagine how many times a bajillion is, imagine one time a bajillion times.
9471205	9472065	That was really poor.
9483996	9485798	Alright, you guys ready to find out who won tonight's cage match?
9485818	9487960	Have you ever thought about password protecting your computer?
9488160	9489261	Girls, that's one!
9489301	9489881	Why, what?
9490562	9494205	So... Aw, Jesus, did you just go in and make folders on my desktop?
9494465	9496587	No, I could, should... No?
9496847	9499550	Hey, even I voted in the cage match today, didn't I, Rob?
9499590	9499890	Stop it.
9500050	9500270	What?
9500611	9501852	Even I voted in the cage match today.
9501872	9502532	Yes, but it didn't count.
9503033	9505495	Because I voted for Skye as the voice of the game for matching service.
9505515	9506236	Alright.
9507133	9509194	Here we go, let's find out tonight's cage match winner, you guys.
9509654	9512695	More votes than I have ever seen in a cage match, ever.
9513215	9517397	And no song, I mean, it was very close between all three songs tonight.
9517577	9518778	So the chat room just loved them all.
9519358	9520558	But only one could win.
9521679	9529022	And the winning song in tonight's cage match is... Pendulum with Hold Your Color.
9530868	9532548	which means I finally fucking won a cage match.
9532568	9532889	Thank you.
9533089	9533829	Thank you, chat room.
9534029	9536569	And thank you... Thank you for giving Rob the pity vote.
9536589	9536810	Yeah.
9537410	9543811	And actually, Miklatov won it, and I didn't even win it, so... Fuck you, Miklatov, for showing me up.
9544031	9545312	More proof, what have I been telling you?
9545352	9547532	Pick stuff other than generic trance, and you'll have a winner.
9547552	9549393	I have been picking stuff other than generic trance.
9550433	9552033	Pick Britney Spears' Toxic.
9552154	9552914	Oh, God, no.
9553314	9554534	I'm just kidding.
9554554	9557495	Actually, it's funny, I actually did have a generic trance song, but it was really good.
9558223	9560064	Well, that means that next week I have to play ABBA.
9560805	9563866	Yeah, I was actually disappointed that you did not choose ABBA tonight.
9564707	9569009	I was trying to actually be serious, but I almost put it in a Danger Doom track.
9570270	9574333	Did you know that the new Madonna song actually samples ABBA?
9575013	9575273	Really?
9575533	9581677	And I honestly thought I had never heard the gayest song ever made, but I think this could possibly be it.
9581917	9586360	Fusing Madonna and ABBA together could quite possibly be anal sex in song form.
9586680	9586780	Hmm.
9588348	9590529	I've already heard foreplay in song form.
9590869	9593911	Anyone who's ever seen Phantom of the Opera has.
9594291	9596993	There should be an ab workout machine called Abba.
9597273	9597813	The Abba.
9598834	9602696	Whenever you crunch it, it gives you like... Mama Mia.
9603076	9605638	Thanks for stopping, stupid.
9606158	9606438	Alright.
9609620	9609960	Alright.
9610801	9611541	Oh my god, it's Rob.
9611822	9620367	I've heard music in foreplay form before too and it's going to start off this next break and we'll be back with more Orange Lounge Radio and the FUs of the week.
9620387	9620988	We've got to get to those.
9621028	9621748	We're running out of time.
9622068	9624450	So we'll be right back after this break with more Orange Lounge Radio.
9672661	9673622	Thanks for watching!
9701586	9702447	Thank you for watching!
9907455	9923943	Came in from the rainy Thursday on the Avenue Thought I heard you talking so fast I turned on the lights, the TV, and the radio Still I can't escape the ghost of you What is happening?
9984358	9989122	From Step Squad to Orange Lounge, this PDR sucks!
9993706	9996128	Holla!
9998711	10000132	We're back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
10000372	10002794	We need more celebrity promos like that, actually.
10002954	10004516	We need more promos in general.
10004596	10007158	We just need to go out with a tape recorder and get more promos.
10007338	10008199	I'll do a promo.
10008639	10009200	Oh, God.
10010410	10014917	Remember, the promos run all day long, though, on the station, so you have to keep it G-rated, because people do listen to us at work.
10016148	10020312	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
10040228	10048655	Hoppin' Choppin' from DDR Mario, of course, they're kind of interworking in that song from, what the hell was it, Mario Brothers 2?
10049596	10052598	God's like, one of my favorite video games of all time, I can't remember the damn name of it.
10053059	10057562	And then, Aurora, featuring Amy Coleman, Ordinary World, of course.
10057662	10061866	Another trance remix of an old song, another thing you love, DarkSakura, yes?
10062666	10066409	When people take 70s and 80s songs, and I particularly hate that version.
10067190	10068191	I have a version of that by Utada Hikaru.
10089810	10096331	Well, I'm sure that's fine, but close to you has been done like a million times, and this one was especially offensive.
10098052	10098572	All right, anyway.
10099992	10102773	We need to get to the FUs of the week, because I'll be damned if we're not running out of show time.
10102813	10108054	So chat room, when you guys send in your FUs tonight, you need to keep it short, because if you don't keep it short, you're getting cut off.
10109254	10110234	I'm cutting you off tonight.
10111694	10113415	So we're going to get into the FUs.
10113455	10115455	So just say fuck you to Rob, and that's it.
10117336	10119196	Extifer, I will take that microphone away from you.
10121567	10123788	Bugged, will you please babysit Extifer?
10124048	10126170	That's going to be your new official show title, Bugged.
10126190	10127951	You're Extifer's babysitter.
10128091	10129151	Get it out of your ass!
10133594	10134114	Oh, lordy.
10134234	10134534	All right.
10136035	10139857	In order for us to have the FUs of the week, I better get DarkSakura's song ready.
10139937	10142699	All right, DarkSakura, why is it that we do the FUs of the week every single week?
10143319	10144340	Grr, argh.
10147093	10164967	FU goes toward all of the traffic on my way up here FU goes toward internet stalkers FU goes toward my rash and amoxicillin and the fact that my ass itches
10167379	10175545	And F you to Blackboard for being down all day because ARC's website was down and I couldn't do my homework.
10175685	10176985	So fuck all that, I'm done.
10179027	10179947	Moving on to Loki!
10182809	10185191	Um, well anyways, what?
10186412	10187713	What the hell is your problem?
10190514	10190895	What?
10191315	10191995	It's my song.
10192236	10195938	Anyways, um, fuck you McDonald's for making subpar food.
10196534	10200836	and until they recently fixed their cups for making cups that explode in my cup holders.
10201577	10202597	Because that fucking sucks.
10202837	10206720	And also fuck you to my neighbors who keep throwing their couches in the goddamn dumpster.
10207380	10210642	That is not what the dumpster is for, it's for trash, not your fucking furniture.
10211202	10214163	You know, pay for it to be hauled away like everyone else.
10215324	10222508	And also, um, fuck you to winning this stupid free online, um, film, uh,
10224147	10224547	Yeah, whatever.
10224848	10226409	I hate that fucking Monopoly game.
10226669	10230352	I'm done.
10239659	10252850	I'd like to give an F you this week to Paranoia Survivor Max for showing up way more than it's welcome on the totally random DDR stream matchup, but it's a good thing my life doesn't revolve around DDR, or I might be upset about that, huh?
10254246	10264055	I'd also like to give an F you to the fact that I feel really, really unprepared for something that's about to take place a week from tomorrow and I'm not excited about it, but that's alright, life sucks sometimes.
10264095	10264495	Is it my birthday?
10265076	10265937	No, it's not your birthday.
10266217	10266637	Yes it is.
10266898	10269440	Well, I mean, yes it is your birthday, but that's not why I'm mad.
10269940	10270321	Shut up!
10270681	10272423	This is my segment.
10273183	10277968	And then an F you to rainbows, like the one on next to her shirt.
10279326	10288931	FU to fuel prices, of course 325 for the low end on diesel, which is kind of crappy The anti-FU to that is, I'm still getting 45 miles a gallon And another FU is to extra fur as well Tyco drums Do they have to be so fucking loud?
10288971	10289291	And that's all
10309733	10310153	Extoverb.
10311734	10312935	Uh, fuck you, bugs.
10314336	10315016	Um, no, no, no, no.
10315316	10324301	I don't have really any FUs other than, uh, let's see, FU to things that suck.
10325882	10326583	Um, I don't know.
10326663	10330605	No, not FU to things that suck, because things that suck are sometimes really good.
10336684	10338445	That's looking at me like, hurry up and finish!
10339125	10339746	That's done!
10339766	10340346	It's done!
10340386	10342187	Oh, okay, you need to say something.
10342247	10343427	I climaxed.
10343487	10344908	I'm done, I'm done, okay.
10345288	10346089	Sexual reference.
10346889	10347029	End.
10349651	10350151	Chat room time.
10351712	10355273	Socorina says, F you to Sean Paul for making Get Busy.
10356774	10361336	Miklatov says, my first F you goes to anyone who likes V. Get over the song, it fucking sucks.
10361697	10365338	Second and last F you goes to Amazon, not having the Pendulum CD in stock.
10365398	10366159	Boo on you guys.
10367745	10372408	Dark Knight says, F you to being on vacation and being broke in the process, well at least I'll have school tomorrow.
10373749	10378612	El Mullet says, F you to V showing up in 27 Bomani games, 3 quarters of which are 2DX.
10379853	10384536	GS191 says, F you to my friends for not even bothering to say happy birthday to me today.
10384876	10386017	No Xmas gift for you.
10387780	10388140	Here we go.
10388180	10388540	Hold on.
10389301	10392362	Let's sing Happy Birthday Orange Lounge style to GS-191.
10392802	10395623	Happy birthday, fuck you.
10396203	10398744	Happy birthday, fuck you.
10398764	10399444	Okay, that's it.
10402365	10402806	Just kidding.
10402846	10403386	Happy birthday.
10404706	10406887	Sycoon says, hey, fuck you.
10408788	10412189	At J-0-0, not the other kind, because that would be offensive.
10414752	10421116	Fireboma says, F you to Con Edison for not restoring power in my house for 28 hours after a storm.
10423378	10427901	Roz says, F you to the gorilla's unofficial chat for making me addicted to Pokemon again.
10429062	10430263	Yeah, what's up with that?
10430644	10431404	What is up with that?
10432205	10436248	DarkTetsuya says, F you to the guy who had us all convinced he had memories.
10436828	10439950	Of course he did, it's already unlocked on the Japanese version.
10440922	10442343	Oh my god, this is classic.
10442403	10451847	Side note, you guys, on the DDR Freak forums, you know how there's this big stink that in DDR Extreme, Memories is like a hidden song that's actually on the disc, but nobody knows how to unlock the song in the game?
10452187	10457549	Well, some guy comes on there and says, My Memories has been in DDR Extreme the whole time, I don't know what you guys are freaking out about.
10459350	10460651	And they're like, Oh yeah?
10460911	10462011	Send us a screenshot!
10462371	10465093	And he sends a screenshot, and it's the Japanese version of Extreme.
10468214	10469615	And he took six points of damage!
10472627	10479391	Oh, and FU to the live 365 keeps kicking me off stream and skipping so I miss most of the show.
10482133	10486256	BlackDevilerX says, froke you to the fact that I haven't been able to listen to the show in forever.
10487477	10494722	Acer800 says, FU to Sky for playing DDR Mario and Ordinary World back to back because it makes me too happy to have any real FUs.
10496738	10501081	SSJ100Matt says, F you to New York Yankee haters.
10501161	10502962	You can't hate a team for winning too much.
10503042	10503963	Let's go Yankees.
10506164	10509747	Laquitas says, I should know this guy's name.
10509787	10510948	I play Final Fantasy XI with him.
10511268	10515371	Says, F you to play online for not allowing me to log in so I can play Final Fantasy XI.
10515411	10516431	Oh, that's actually from Anna.
10516571	10518172	Sorry.
10518733	10523456	One more F you to the water leaking in our ceiling and causing horrible house maintenance problems.
10523476	10524577	That's actually from Anala.

10527401	10530882	Goggle says, Froke having two physics labs due on the same day.
10533002	10540444	Kai of Blur says, two things, F you to my communications class having a speech on Tuesday when I'm still sick.
10540644	10544005	Also, fuck 4chan.org, the black hole of the internet.
10544045	10544945	God bless it.
10547226	10553267	Nintendo Maniac 64 says, F you Midway for delaying the GameCube version of Midway Arcade Treasures 3 by a month.

10561208	10564630	F you to the LA Angels for nearly eliminating the Yankees in the playoffs.
10566871	10569933	And Floatwalk says, from Melody, F you to Poland.
10572195	10573555	Just the whole country, fuck them all.
10573635	10574216	Egypt's better.
10575116	10575617	Fuck them all.
10576537	10578338	Alright, just kidding if you're Polish, just kidding.
10578358	10580780	There's obviously an inside joke there that you don't know about if you got offended.
10580800	10582261	I'm of Polish descent.
10582321	10584322	Well, obviously, there's an inside joke, so don't take it seriously.
10584824	10585805	So fuck me.
10587907	10588668	No thank you, I'll leave it.
10588688	10590730	You know, Will Smith doesn't have to cuss to sell records.
10591630	10592211	But I do.
10592671	10594313	So fuck him, and fuck you too.
10594333	10596455	Isn't that a lyric?
10596735	10598377	Isn't that a lyric in a song somewhere?
10598577	10600479	It's from an Eminem song.
10600539	10602461	I cuss when I've heard that lyric somewhere before.
10602841	10604262	Yeah, Will Smith really prides himself on it.
10604302	10605363	He doesn't curse in his music.
10605384	10608807	But he samples everybody.
10609628	10610028	Yes, he does.
10612861	10614042	Oh, we had one late FU.
10614682	10617383	Morty says, Froke, Frigid Roommates.
10619124	10619624	Frigid Roommates.
10619644	10620124	I agree.
10621144	10622225	Shut up, asshole.
10623205	10624126	I'm not frigid.
10625586	10627207	I'll have you know, I was quite warm.
10627327	10627627	Never mind.
10627647	10629588	She's kidding.
10629628	10629928	I'm kidding.
10629968	10630248	I'm kidding.
10630929	10631269	All right.
10632964	10634324	God, we're running out of time on the show.
10634344	10635545	They want to do Ask Orange Lounge.
10635585	10638005	We don't really have the time, so I think we're going to have to... That's it.
10638025	10638785	You want to do it real quick?
10638825	10639465	Just do it.
10639726	10640266	All right.
10640346	10642706	You know, because we still got the podcast to do, and you want to go out.
10643586	10643906	I know.
10644267	10644547	All right.
10645247	10648348	But where would we be without our fans?
10648528	10649308	Probably in bed.
10649408	10649768	All right.
10651248	10652088	Doing what in bed?
10652288	10652688	No.
10653649	10654309	Summer party!
10657386	10659407	Alright guys, fine, we'll do really quick.
10659427	10667729	I remember going to slumber parties with a bunch of people and the first girl who fell asleep, we would take her bra and stuff, like dip it in orange juice and put it in the freezer.
10668229	10671110	My sister and her friend did that to one of their friends one time.
10671610	10672430	It was really funny.
10672570	10680792	And then when the last person to stay awake would go and put toothpaste on the toilet seat so that the first person who woke up in half-asleep mode to go use the bathroom would stick to the toilet.
10686014	10686254	Wow.
10693044	10695986	Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.
10696486	10699688	What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?
10700209	10701770	I think it's very interesting.
10702070	10707173	We didn't even need a question to find out that Jamie played with other girls' bras.
10714192	10716993	Fireboma said, where do babies come from?
10717213	10718833	No, seriously, I don't know.
10719253	10722534	I will let Extifer answer this question on behalf of Orange Lounge Radio.
10722634	10724655	Extifer, where do babies come from?
10725035	10727195	Babies come from a female's coo.
10731136	10735077	Legend of Zaku said, you guys seriously need a Wikipedia entry.
10735737	10736117	We do.
10736157	10736837	How do we do that?
10737578	10738878	Someone has to make us one.
10739804	10740705	Somebody make us one.
10740985	10741807	Is Bug gonna do it?
10742387	10743429	Bug's working on it right now.
10743489	10745771	Do people have to vote on it to make it stick?
10746232	10746552	Oh, good.
10746933	10748195	Okay, Bug's gonna write that right now.
10748555	10749156	Thank you, Zaku.
10749176	10750337	The ferret needs an entry, too.
10750417	10751098	We'll post that, though.
10751479	10754142	Oh, other things I want to point out...
10755612	10760554	Vote us a 5 on your player window in Line365, speaking of voting stuff.
10760854	10764975	And for the love of God, vote for us on Podcast Alley, because we're really falling behind over there.
10765275	10769517	So for your convenience, I'm going to post a link to where you can vote for our show.
10769557	10774839	And you should do that right now, because that's a really good way for our podcast to get exposure.
10779770	10781091	I hate that podcast.
10781991	10782612	It's a gas.
10784113	10784393	Alright.
10785974	10786994	Oh, did somebody already do it?
10789756	10791297	Somebody posted a Wikipedia link.
10791417	10792177	Did somebody already do it?
10793818	10795739	Somebody probably just made an entry that says, it sucks.
10796720	10797440	It stinks!
10799601	10800282	Oh, no, it's not there.
10800302	10800562	Okay.
10801002	10801663	Yeah, you need to start.
10801703	10802843	Somebody needs to hurry up and write it.
10803664	10803924	Alright.
10805814	10811476	Sakurina says, why is American Thanksgiving later than Canadian Thanksgiving, which is now?
10812137	10813037	Wait a second!
10813297	10814037	Oh yes, Loki.
10814538	10817039	Why do the Canadians get Thanksgiving anyways?
10817059	10818579	Yeah, how many Indians did they kill?
10818699	10819039	Come on.
10819520	10820280	Exactly.
10820820	10822261	They didn't rape the land of Indians.
10824835	10826135	No, just kidding.
10827436	10829216	God, we're horribly offensive sometimes.
10829276	10830776	I really hope we didn't offend anybody with that comment.
10831116	10835598	But if anything, they should be giving thanks for maple syrup because that's what they're known for.
10836058	10836978	That and Bryan Adams.
10837478	10839618	I really don't know why Thanksgiving is later.
10842059	10845120	It's all timed for the shopping industry.
10845140	10847200	They gave us Atlantis, Rob.
10847840	10848481	I know, I know.
10848721	10849861	And Bryan Adams.
10851841	10852822	And William Shatner.
10853622	10854402	Where would we be
10856812	10858913	Wasn't Michael J. Fox from Canada?
10859954	10861335	What about David Duchovny?
10862055	10866578	You remember that song, David Duchovny, Why Won't You Love Me?
10867378	10867659	No.
10868299	10869500	Someone wrote a song about him.
10869800	10874663	If somebody in the chatroom is saying that DDR Freak is not allowed to have a Wikipedia entry, so why should we?
10875111	10876832	Who said DDR Free is not allowed to have a Wikipedia entry?
10876852	10877393	That's not cool!
10877433	10879435	Yeah, make them one!
10880696	10882777	I think they had one and it got removed or something.
10883118	10884299	Somebody probably complained about it.
10885159	10890844	Dude, if we get a Wikipedia entry posted, just fucking don't complain about it and we'll be fine.
10890924	10892065	So don't tattle.
10892385	10895988	If you tattle, I will come find you and beat you up and it will not be a good thing.
10896609	10898971	Because you'll probably end up beating Rafa.
10901837	10912304	Jaded2005 says, why is it cheaper to rent movies and expensive to rent video games?
10914226	10915747	Because video games are more expensive than movies.
10915787	10917168	Video games set you back like 50 bucks.
10917308	10919469	Movies now only set you back like 25.
10919629	10923352	Exactly, and they have to rent more times in order to make their money back.
10925794	10927675	And stop stealing games, people!
10928319	10930040	Stop stealing them from the rental stores.
10930060	10931081	That's what the internet's for.
10932582	10934404	If I mispronounce this, I'm really sorry.
10934524	10940168	I don't know if it's just E or just with like the silent E. I'm not sure if the E is silent or not.
10940328	10941149	I think just.
10941509	10942330	I'm going to go with just.
10943951	10944772	It could be just day.
10944972	10948855	It could be like just day, like Jack A. This person is going to kick my ass.
10949075	10949855	I'm going to go with just.
10949935	10950196	All right.
10950716	10953778	Why did you decide to start making an online radio show?
10953798	10954199	Okay.
10955390	10962299	Meep, personally, I've been doing online radio personally since I was in college, which was a long time ago.
10963200	10971370	I'm actually not that old, but I was doing a college radio show and then I got invited to be on another internet radio program called Under Sedation Live.
10971730	10978634	That was years ago, and that just kind of turned into this, where it was like, you know what, we have fun doing Understation Live, let's do a show about video games.
10978914	10980074	And sure enough, here we are.
10980375	10982256	DarkSakura was a frequent guest on that show.
10982636	10985858	Loki just kind of showed up, but it worked out, so Loki's still here.
10989700	10990420	Juice Day.
10990540	10991401	It is Juice Day.
10993101	10994782	Not Just Day, but Juice Day.
10995743	10996443	Just for the record.
10997604	10997864	All right.
11000479	11017746	SSJ100 Matt wants to know, I may be the only person on Earth to break an afterburner pad.
11018146	11019527	Am I the only one to break one?
11020947	11020987	No.
11022908	11023148	No.
11023488	11024068	Loki says no.
11024148	11025349	How do you know this for a fact, Loki?
11026843	11029764	That's ridiculous to say that you're the only person that's broken one.
11029924	11031044	They're not indestructible.
11031724	11037305	I'm sure at some point, like, somebody who weighed like 700 pounds tried to play on one and probably broke it.
11037546	11039566	So, I think that's safe to say, wouldn't you?
11040646	11040846	Sure.
11040866	11044047	You're probably not the first, but you might be one of a very select few.
11044887	11046048	And that's something to be proud about.
11047448	11047828	Okay, no.
11049268	11050669	Lastly, last question here.
11050689	11051549	I hope this is a good one.
11051969	11052089	Um...
11053624	11058973	Nintendomaniac64 Why did Midway delay the GameCube version of Midway Arcade Treasures 3?
11060635	11063520	And why did my laptop just lag for like 12 minutes straight?
11063988	11067549	GameCube games seem to be getting finished last.
11067849	11071249	Like, for example, Rainbow Six Lockdown didn't come out until two weeks later.
11071889	11075270	Same with Midway Arcade Treasures doesn't come out until two weeks later.
11075290	11078150	One of the Mortal Kombat games came out way later for GameCube 2, right?
11078190	11079511	The Deception.
11079751	11087332	Yeah, it's just, I don't know, either they have to go through some process of, you know, Nintendo has to review it or something, or I don't know.
11087812	11089092	For whatever reason, it gets delayed.
11091313	11091953	Very interesting.
11092733	11092993	Alright.
11094090	11095610	We've got to call it a show, boys and girls.
11095710	11096351	We're done here.
11096451	11098751	And sorry, Nintendo Mania, I can't help you with your laptop.
11099891	11101852	Call your local computer experts.
11102452	11102712	All right.
11103973	11104873	Final thoughts, you guys.
11104913	11105533	It's the end of the show.
11105593	11106373	Bugs, your final thought.
11108414	11109454	I like my PSP.
11110434	11111374	Extifer, your final thought.
11114155	11114675	Stop it.
11116076	11118376	I don't like his PSP.
11120297	11121097	Loki, your final thought.
11124392	11126196	I have too many GameStop receipts.
11126677	11128039	My final thought is, meow.
11129141	11129622	DarkSakura?
11130444	11131706	Reject false icons.
11131807	11132688	Bleach your Katamari.
11134073	11135374	DarkSakura, what is tonight's final word?
11159153	11160854	That does it for another... Hold on.
11160954	11161674	That was two.
11161834	11162555	That was two.
11162975	11163835	You pick one.
11164135	11165256	You pick one or the other.
11165296	11167337	I had to quote the game, but it's itchy.
11168637	11173519	That does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live.

11214927	11238449	When he made Pearl Harbor I miss you more than that movie missed the point And that's an awful lot, girl And now, now you've gone away And all I'm trying to say is Pearl Harbor sucked And I miss you
11249304	11275447	Needs acting school, he was terrible in that film I need you like Kubo Gooding needed a bigger part He's way better than Ben Affleck and now All I can think about is your smile and that shitty movie too Pearl Harbor sucks, and I miss you
11283657	11287559	Why does Michael beg to keep on making movies?
11287739	11289639	I guess Pearl Harbor sucks.
