26007	30451	It's that video game podcast on the internet dedicated to all the gaming news you really want to know about.
30471	40400	You know, there's a whole lot of gaming podcasts out there now, so thank you guys especially for choosing us and sticking with us because I think if you go to the iTunes list of video game podcasts that are available, you get like a hundred.
40700	41321	There's tons of them.
41641	43022	So thank you guys for choosing us.
44073	44293	DarkSakura
71863	73744	My name is Zul.
74705	76666	Are you the Keymaster?
77006	77526	Oh, God.
77706	78007	All right.
78027	78667	That was bad.
78707	78987	All right.
79007	81409	That was the ferret.
81509	83010	Also with us, Techmaster Loki.
83470	83970	I am here.
84230	84691	And I'm me.
85151	86752	So, yeah.
86852	87692	I don't believe you.
88113	89493	You're not the gatekeeper or whatever?
89533	89774	No.
90294	90834	No gatekeeper.
90854	92795	That's good, because then you guys would have to have sex or something.
92815	93416	That would be nasty.
94436	94957	I'm married.
95017	95377	Thank you.
95457	95877	I know you are.
97018	97298	Anyway.
98800	99020	GAMING WEEK
115191	116891	It's all about me, you know.
117131	118072	Yeah, I know.
118152	119412	The diva of the show.
119612	121752	How was your gaming week, DarkSakura?
121952	126573	Actually, I was so busy all week, I haven't had much of a chance to play things, although I have put in effort.
127053	130534	I got a Dalmatian on that dog game.
130554	131174	Nintendogs?
131414	131974	Yeah.
132374	133014	How quickly we forget.
133034	135275	After forgetting to feed my dogs for like two days.
136395	141476	I have a new dog that lives with my Corgiine and my Shiba Inu Minchi.
141496	141876	Mm-hmm.
142580	143821	Dan also got me that Lawyer game.
169082	170222	Phoenix Wright, Ace Attorney.
170242	171443	Phoenix Wright, Ace Attorney.
171843	176084	I think it's ironic that there's like a lawyer game and a doctor game out like right around the same time.
176164	177404	Doctor game's getting a sequel too.
177424	177864	Trauma Center.
178024	178564	Oh my gosh.
178904	180805	I've heard Trauma Center is really difficult.
180825	183445	I haven't gotten a chance to play it, but I hear Trauma Center is really, really difficult.
183705	187026	You know, unfortunately that brings me back to the game of Life and Death.
187066	189907	Remember that game back on the PC way long time ago?
189967	192107	I think about Operation, but sorry, DarkSakura.
192127	194648	Wouldn't Operation just be... Operation the MMO.
195848	196008	No.
196468	198389	You know, too many doctors ruin the operation.
199556	202938	But yeah, I was going to play it and then Dan started to play it.
203079	206701	He's still playing through Castlevania, that butt, so he needs to let me play the attorney game.
207421	208462	I need to solve cases.
209462	210583	I'm good at that kind of thing.
211924	214766	I also tried to play some Katamari, but I was too busy.
215026	217327	And then I screamed obscenities at Illustrator this morning.
218508	218908	Good times.
219409	222330	Maybe you could check out an Illustrator podcast to help you out there.
222350	224832	I'm sure there's got to be one out there somewhere.
224972	226213	We hate Adobe Hour.
228230	232295	Thank you to everybody that helped out with that, sending your donations in online.
249233	250815	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
267093	271616	And then turn over the proceeds with our donations.
271736	277659	Because I actually donated my own copies of Polarium and Field of Magic, which I'm done with both of those games very much.
277699	280460	Yeah, because I remember how much you love Polarium.
281440	281701	You know what?
281721	283041	There's worse DS games out there, though.
283862	287584	Check out my review of Sprung last week if you want to hear a bad deal.
287704	288964	I still need Electroplankton.
288984	289725	That's what I'm waiting for.
290085	290865	I want to check that out, too.
291145	292526	Loki, how was your game of the week?
292886	293667	I didn't play too much.
293967	296048	I did get to play a new game for the PSP.
296658	298238	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
326121	326721	That's still fun.
327102	329363	It doesn't get boring at all.
329944	336168	The game I haven't been playing is Nintendogs because I'm tired of that game now and I'm not feeding my dog.
336228	337949	My dog floated to the top of the bowl.
338670	342512	You need to bring Taco over so I can play with Taco before he runs away.
344213	344534	Alright.
345882	346202	That's it?
347523	348404	Well, Burnout.
348424	349124	Burnout Revenge.
349825	350405	I've been playing that.
350725	354268	I'm going to check out some different games this week.
354308	356129	I've got SSX on tour.
357030	360272	I'm anticipating Warriors, which is coming out this week.
360772	362133	So I'll definitely be reviewing that.
363534	364095	My gaming week?
364335	366637	I've been playing Castlevania DS still.
366817	368618	I know I talked about it last week, but I love it.
368798	369158	I love it.
369278	369819	It's a great game.
369999	371040	So I've been playing a lot more of that.
371420	374302	And honestly, not a whole lot of new stuff until today.
375356	376437	The Day We Were Recording This Show
397379	399320	So I think I finally narrowed it down to a couple.
399961	403163	And I know DarkSakura and I will both be playing on one of those servers together.
403183	403623	So it'll be cool.
404063	405464	It will be on Scarlet Crusade.
405524	405685	Yes.
405785	406725	And we're both playing Alliance.
406745	407686	Please don't cyber-stalk us.
408166	408326	Yes.
408927	411168	But I'm not saying who our characters are or what.
411188	413049	Because they won't be named after ourselves.
413790	415371	But if you want to cyber-stalk us, send us an email.
415391	415751	You never know.
416752	419593	Somebody sent me an email that says, hey, I want to add you to Xbox Live.
419654	421114	And I said, okay, why not?
421195	422295	And then they kicked my ass in Halo.
422375	425537	I'm wondering if they're doing new gamer tags for Xbox Live for the 360.
425597	425697	Yeah.
427028	432130	I'm curious about that too, because I want to try and get Sky, just Sky, but... Same.
432750	442714	I don't think I'll be able to do it, but I will be willing to, you know, get on Xbox Live right when I get the game, so... Because I don't have just plain old Sky on regular Xbox right now.
442954	443554	I have something else.
443895	444715	Otherwise I got backup.
446167	446968	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
465886	489166	but I'm playing a warlock but I'm only like level 3 right now but I thought it was pretty badass because I actually got a spell where you can set something on fire and that was cool like actually setting it on fire I have not left Final Fantasy XI I'm just going to try and balance the two games I'm going to balance the two games for a little while there's things about Final Fantasy XI that were really starting to get to me so I want to play World of Warcraft no there's things I like about Final Fantasy XI there's things I dislike about Final Fantasy XI I really need to sit down and
489778	515395	Dedicate time to play the game I haven't played in months And I really, I don't want to give it up I still want to play the game But I need to dedicate a day or something In which the fianc√© will not interfere with the game And I get to play I need to give WoW a fair shot Because honestly, I owe it to our listeners To give an unbiased perspective of what's going on in WoW Let's give away some crap You can send me a letter We'll see
516249	517190	Let's give away some crap.
517310	519291	Last week we promised we would give away some crap.
519671	524634	We're going to give away a copy of Death Junior and pull a number out of the hat there, DarkSakura.
524674	527636	Let's see who's going to be our lucky winner of Death Junior for the PSP.
529137	529577	Two.
530017	533700	Number two wins Death Junior on the PSP.
533800	534320	Let's see.
534560	545447	This is going to somebody who didn't say anything in their email, so I don't know if they have a screen name, but it's Noam, and I hope I said that right, Noam P. Noam P. I'm not going to say the whole last name.
545507	545747	Noam P.
546195	547456	won the copy of Death Jr.
547476	548096	on the PSP.
548196	548816	Good for you.
549196	550657	And now we're going to give away Coated Arms.
551337	552998	Pull another number out of the hat there, if you will.
554319	554959	Let's see.
555219	556620	Dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig.
558021	558461	Twelve.
559101	560182	Number twelve.
560202	562663	It's going to be this one.
566785	575109	It's Jason, and there's no last name, but I think it's cute because the username, it's coming from a Gmail address, and this is not the same as the username, but it's...
575876	578217	and Otakuland is how their name comes up.
578257	581778	Otakuland is one of our also regular writers to our 2GoBox.
581899	582319	Oh, really?
582879	583439	Well, good deal.
584059	586761	Otakuland won a copy of Coded Arms for the PSP, so there you have it.
586781	597585	Just remember, folks, if you do have PSPs that are version 1.5 and you're going to be playing these games, I think Coded Arms does have a 2.0 update on it, so you want to go get that version changer, which is available on PSP Updates.
598929	626868	I also would like to mention that Otakuland has actually been very helpful to me by suggesting there's a site called GameTZ just G-A-M-E-T-Z dot com that has people who deal in import games trading import games and someone on there has Panorama Cotton they want 500 freaking dollars for it and I said no but they do trade in the rare that would be a great Christmas present
628485	634589	If some dear listener wants to spend $500 on little old me, I ain't stopping you.
634609	635629	You're a sucker, for one.
635649	636770	I ain't stopping you.
636790	638611	All right, well, congratulations to our two winners there.
638651	641233	I'm glad some people that are involved in the show could win those.
641313	642053	So good job, guys.
642353	643754	We will do another giveaway very soon.
643814	644474	Tune in next week.
644935	645875	Maybe we'll have something next week.
645895	647496	Loki, do we have anything in the prize vault for next week?
647576	647876	Do we know?
648096	652619	I've got an assortment of anime soundtracks, like a ton of them.
653239	654180	So, possibly.
654460	656341	Okay, well, we'll just have to give a whole lot of those away, so...
657415	658375	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
685043	686004	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
710114	710955	Thank you for watching!
725580	728461	and also comparing it to what the current laws are.
730341	733222	Actually, there's one in particular that is actually the first one used.
734943	748646	Actually, the person who wrote this article did a comparison by showing the law about the sale of alcohol to minors compared with the law regarding the game sale.
749338	758023	And the game sale one reads as this, except as otherwise provided in subdivision C, every person who sells, furnishes, gives, or causes to be sold, furnished, or given away.
758543	760584	Oh, actually, that's the alcoholic beverage one.
762885	767928	But anyway, are given away any alcoholic beverage to any person under the age of 21 years is guilty of a misdemeanor.
768508	778096	Any person under the age of 21 who purchases any alcoholic beverage or any person under the age of 21 who consumes any alcoholic beverage in any on-sale premises is guilty of a misdemeanor.
779217	784220	Now, compared to the violent game law, I'll just read a little bit of part of it.
784541	796830	Violent video game means a video game in which the range of options available to a player includes killing, maiming, dismembering, or sexually assaulting the image of a human being if those acts are depicted in the game in a manner that does either the fault.
796870	797491	It goes into...
801265	802546	The whole outline of it.
808032	818942	A lot of what it's going into as far as trying to define is that it's going on the assumption that it's depicting a violent act on a person.
819602	822385	Thing is, is that they're not people.
823265	824966	and their video game images.
825186	832248	Without rehashing this whole same argument over and over again though because it seems like we've had something about violent video games like every week on this program for the last three months.
832268	834149	The point is it's not a clear law.
834689	836950	Who makes that definition?
837110	837830	What is violent?
838070	840051	Who makes that definition and who's checking on them?
840071	842032	Because we've got a system of checks and balances in this country.
842332	844573	Who's checking on the people that are making these calls?
844593	845253	That's what I want to know.
845433	849334	And the whole point it makes here is how clear the sale of alcohol law is.
850115	850975	In comparison to this
851485	852787	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
867066	869788	When the same something does not exist.
870329	874733	I don't necessarily disagree with trying to control the sale of games.
875213	880137	Just like you would say that an under 17 person shouldn't buy an R-rated DVD.
880558	887684	But my whole thing is that the bill is so vague that it seems like it's just prepared to be there to...
888666	891987	Target things when they come out like Grand Theft Auto.
892067	898929	It's built so that when somebody kills somebody and blames Grand Theft Auto, that's when people are going to panic and say, who sold them the game?
899009	899410	Find them.
899690	900370	Invoke the law.
900710	904891	But my question is, no, no, before that all happens, who is making the determination what is a value?
904911	905892	That's my biggest problem with the law.
906032	907352	Otherwise, whatever.
907472	910253	I suppose they have to do what they have to do, and I'm okay with them.
910713	912454	I was all for ratings.
913075	917317	because ratings puts the power in the hands of those who should possess it, the parents.
917377	919918	Why not have the bill just adopt the ratings that are in place right now?
919938	920719	You know what this is?
920839	926001	It's basically legalizing censorship as far as... In a way, in a way.
927176	929037	It's limiting free expression.
929738	932299	It's not stopping the games from being made, no.
933140	935041	But it's putting the scarlet letter on them.
935321	936782	Yeah, that's exactly it.
936862	939243	That's a great comparison right there.
939743	951751	But let's face it, in some of our demographic, I know for me, the games that have the scarlet letter on them, or should I say the scarlet number, I'm going to be more attracted to and go, ooh, do I get to see some titties in this one?
952131	952651	Exactly.
952751	954212	I want more titties in my games if
954758	956922	No, they're going to be preventing kids from buying them.
957202	959527	That means, Rockstar, the gloves are off.
960048	961150	Do whatever the fuck you want.
961170	962974	Just release the games.
963775	964737	Anyway, alright.
965879	966461	I think...
968911	977633	I look at this as the government basically trying to take the power from the people, trying to take the responsibility out of the people's hands.
978674	989777	I do admit, the game companies do have a duty of responsibility to the consumer to make sure that the product that they put on the market is exactly what they say they're selling.
989877	990237	Exactly.
992391	996053	To rate the game appropriately and market the game towards the appropriate audience.
996314	1006339	To compare, when I was studying business law, they brought up a case about a woman who was suing over having pieces of clamshell in her clam chowder.
1006940	1007620	And she broke a tooth.
1008061	1008641	So she sued.
1010022	1017886	The thing is, is that there is an expectation that there may be clamshell in the game.
1018347	1020528	She lost, not in the game, but in the soup.
1021380	1023301	Warning, this game may contain clam parts.
1023921	1035244	But she lost the case because under the rights and responsibility for, say, food handling, having bits and pieces in that, chicken soup, you know, or buy fish fillet.
1035324	1037125	You may have a fish bone in your fish fillet.
1037685	1049228	Now, to compare, when you buy a game that is rated M, you should expect that there's going to be mature themes in the game.
1050040	1051341	You may see some boobies.
1052222	1053663	You may hear the F word.
1055185	1057467	Regardless, you have been warned.
1058528	1062671	By that little N being on the bottom of the game, you have been warned.
1063512	1067215	Now, I do think that Rockstar was lax.
1067536	1070478	I mean, and even so, I can't really fault this either.
1071079	1073401	You know, removing the code, bracketing it out.
1075163	1076263	That's done all the time.
1076283	1077744	Aren't we feeling a little blue in the face here?
1078144	1078484	I am.
1079305	1083666	But, you know, honestly, there is and is not fault in that.
1083746	1085767	Technically, they did remove access to it.
1086187	1088688	It just happened to be somebody out there who's curious enough to find it.
1089042	1089982	Well, no easy answer.
1090002	1092583	All right, we welcome your feedback, as always, to go at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
1092604	1094044	I'm tired of talking about this subject.
1094344	1095605	All right, then let's get to a new one.
1095625	1101327	Let's talk about, ooh, Digital Life happened this weekend, which was that big expo in New York, which I really wanted to go to, but I couldn't.
1101567	1102548	But I heard it was very crowded.
1102588	1109911	We had some folks call in on our live show Sunday nights that were at Digital Life, saying that just crowded amongst crowded, just really, really crowded stuff.
1110751	1112612	A few folks got to check out some new games, though.
1113432	1117716	One thing that did happen was that the Xbox Live Arcade lineup was announced.
1117796	1122440	Now, Loki, I know you talked about this a little bit last week because you had some photos of some of the games in development.
1122721	1125023	But they did kind of officially say what's going to be in it.
1125383	1128045	What I think is interesting, a whole lot of PopCap games showing up.
1128266	1131689	Astro Pop, Bejeweled 2, Zuma going to be in there.
1132329	1133390	Some other games in there as well.
1133570	1135432	Gauntlet, Joust.
1136038	1146942	and then of course the Marble Blaster talking about Robotron and Smash TV which is kind of interesting to me that they would put these in the arcade when you can just buy the Midway Arcade Treasures Collection which would be a much better deal I think for some of those games.
1147042	1148122	Remember, don't shoot the food.
1148462	1148842	Yeah, I know.
1149843	1153324	That's not the complete list but those are the only games that sound very familiar to me.
1154304	1158886	So check that out if you're curious on your Xbox 360 when you get that.
1159826	1160646	Also on the Xbox 360...
1163939	1164579	This is interesting.
1164599	1165619	They're doing this in Japan.
1165639	1169060	They're going to be doing a beta test of Final Fantasy XI on the brand new Xbox 360.
1170061	1183264	The console launches in Japan on December 10th, and if you purchase the limited edition Xbox 360 package, you're going to get a free Final Fantasy XI beta test disc while supplies last.
1184022	1187644	DarkSakura, you have a story about the 360 as well and some kind of bad news about the dev kits.
1187704	1187804	Yeah.
1187824	1189124	We did cover about the theft of the 360 dev kit
1214056	1218462	I think so, but if we didn't, I'm sure people read about it or heard about it on another cast or something.
1218502	1219924	But yeah, some dev kits were stolen.
1221385	1230497	At any rate, a Dutch newspaper reported that Microsoft is preparing a $100 million lawsuit against those responsible for the theft.
1233616	1240299	Because they're wanting to protect the security so that you can't hack the Xbox 360.
1240599	1244361	Which you know is a big problem with the Xbox here is that they pretty much broke it right away.
1245101	1250243	And we started having a meme on the Xbox and extra huge hard drives.
1250543	1251423	Loki, why are you laughing?
1251684	1257266	I'm laughing because the way they set up the whole hard drive situation anyways is just asking to be hacked.
1257765	1258266	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1280410	1285255	There's also an interesting statement on here, though, from the hacking group who's, I guess, responsible.
1285896	1289980	It's from, I hope I'm saying this wrong, it's smartxx.com.
1290000	1291122	You hope you're saying that wrong?
1292783	1294065	He said, I hope I'm saying that wrong.
1294645	1296207	I said, I hope I'm not saying that wrong.
1296227	1296768	Oh, my bad.
1298470	1299371	I threw a ferret at you.
1299391	1301553	Alright, anyway.
1302931	1329851	but they're saying the website the pictures of the stolen dev kits emerged claiming Microsoft was actually complicit in the group's acquisition of the kits they went on to say I'm going to just quote this here according to the poster people within Microsoft unaware of the operation went on to inform the police that they should investigate SmartXX leading to the current situation and that Microsoft was going to deny it as usual
1331477	1332340	I thought that was very interesting.
1332360	1333964	That was interesting.
1334085	1336491	Speaking of people getting busted...
1337771	1340792	A Game Pirate in Richmond, Texas.
1341192	1342152	I guess we should say in a legend.
1342212	1351015	No, I guess not a legend anymore because this guy was sentenced to three years and ten months in a federal prison and a fine of $1.15 million.
1352235	1356216	That's Dashiel Ponce de Leon receiving this sentence there.
1356536	1361798	That $1.15 million representing the retail value of all the software this guy sold.
1362138	1364319	Now, this guy wasn't doing the thing on BitTorrent or anything.
1364339	1365059	This guy was actually...
1365399	1368361	Downloading stuff online then reselling it through the internet.
1368421	1370162	That's the worst kind of piracy right there.
1370202	1372824	That's the kind that a lot of people say even they want to.
1372844	1374545	That hurts the pockets of the developers.
1375346	1377107	And just downloading off BitTorrent doesn't?
1378367	1379788	Well, stop making crappy games.
1379848	1383631	That's one person as opposed to one person multiplying the efforts.
1384306	1385007	I buy games.
1385328	1386109	Look at my collection.
1386169	1388732	I have tons of games that I pay money for.
1388812	1393919	I don't think that anyone who lives in my house cannot say that I don't buy a lot of games.
1394260	1396002	I just don't want to buy an import system, so...
1397990	1398811	I am so sick of this loser.
1424452	1426914	He needs to team up with that guy from the 700 Club.
1427054	1427555	I know, I know.
1427595	1431658	But anyway, this is the guy who was saying, video games are evil.
1431758	1438184	And people refute him with backing up everything with solid evidence, and then he goes, well, you're just a pissant.
1438564	1446231	Well, I thought this was interesting, is that earlier this week you might have heard the National Institute on Media and the Family, NIMF,
1446530	1455778	The President David Walsh kind of wrote a letter that kind of distanced himself from Jack Thompson and said, I really wish you'd stop using our name in your arguments and stuff.
1456398	1458600	A quote from the letter here.
1458680	1462643	Your commentary has included extreme hyperbole and your... Hyperbole.
1462663	1463204	Hyperbole.
1463704	1464585	I was correcting myself.
1464985	1465466	Hyperbole.
1465486	1470210	And your tactics have included personally attacking individuals for whom I have a great deal of respect.
1470670	1471671	I thought that was very interesting.
1471691	1472311	Well, get this.
1473032	1474533	Dr. Thompson fought back.
1475214	1475534	Doctor?
1476719	1478442	I think he, is he a doctor?
1479243	1481866	He's a doctor of... No, he's not a doctor.
1482126	1485591	He's a doctor of things he can't say on the air.
1485671	1488655	I kind of fused two words together there.
1489231	1497814	Anyway, no, what he did there is that he actually kind of denied, saying, the fact is, I have never suggested that Dr. Walsh approves of what I do.
1498194	1501956	I have countless times told people that I believe he is an expert around the dangers of video games.
1502236	1514720	The mistake I made, apparently, naively, is thinking that a person of his expertise would use it actually to help some bereaved families rather than choose to protect his relationship with portions of the video game industry and its reckless retail network.
1516331	1522296	and then he goes on to say, I'm a Christian and I think Dr. Walsh is as well and there's a passage in the New Testament.
1522316	1524197	What does that have to do with anything?
1524217	1527040	Thou shall not play violent video games.
1527240	1533465	I'm really wondering why people keep bringing up Christianity as an illustration of morality.
1534826	1536827	That's a whole other topic for a whole other cast.
1536907	1537768	I know, I know.
1537788	1538629	I'm not going to go into it.
1538749	1543453	It's just I find it highly hilarious how he's defending himself saying, oh, but I'm a Christian.
1543833	1544994	Yet he's going around saying,
1545527	1547668	Basically slandering innocent people.
1548709	1556892	You know, like I said before, when people are presenting him with evidence that proves him wrong, he's going back and calling them names.
1557273	1562015	And I don't want to get into religious debate, but from what I understand about Christianity, there's only one judge.
1563616	1565256	Oh, he's going to have to answer to it.
1565276	1566697	There's only one judge.
1566777	1567637	No, it's not Wapner.
1569278	1569598	All right.
1569698	1570819	Judge Wapner, guy.
1571179	1572660	No, he's doing the pet court or something.
1572800	1572940	Oh.
1573655	1574195	DarkSakura.com
1603459	1605300	Jack Thompson compared this guy to Hitler.
1606020	1608802	And that's one of the people that this group associates with.
1608822	1615205	One of the things I was going to mention is remember last week we were talking about how he was proposing that game companies create his game.
1615926	1616166	Anyways.
1616539	1621981	So then Penny Arcade, of course, said he would pay $10,000 if his game was created.
1622001	1626842	Well, they're like, well, that's kind of weak because we donated half a million dollars for this charity.
1627582	1628102	So what did he do?
1628462	1634744	He found their phone number and their signature that was in their email and yelled at them, literally.
1634944	1636725	Called them up and yelled.
1636765	1637045	Yelled.
1638581	1639182	That was pretty lame.
1639682	1641823	This guy is obviously mentally unstable.
1642004	1651890	Now, obviously, this guy is becoming kind of like the laughingstock of the video game community, so now you're seeing him in all sorts of mods, and what did you find?
1652730	1658194	Well, it's the Jack Thompson murder simulator called Defamation of Character.
1659114	1666519	And it's basically a mod for Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, and you can find this at hellfish...
1667632	1670615	That was a guy you compared to Hitler.
1682915	1686576	Yes, and basically they kind of go through what you can do.
1687376	1700100	He is Jack Thompson, who also is his alter ego, Bandman, who they actually have dressed up in some weird box and just some funny stuff.
1700120	1709382	But anyways, you go through a bunch of different missions, including murdering, I believe it was two live crew.
1711476	1713177	I don't think they're going to like that very much.
1713517	1720818	Yeah, you're murdering two left crew who they have a picture on the website hanging, looks like upside down, dead from his ceiling.
1721078	1724879	He was actually also the one responsible for the whole cop killer thing with Ice-T.
1724919	1726099	Some of you guys have a lot of free time.
1726319	1726939	I know it's out there.
1726959	1728760	Some of you gamers have a lot of free time.
1728960	1731520	But I thought here's what was funny, though.
1731600	1736421	Some of the special abilities he had, he can do, of course, bullet time like every other game.
1736684	1742108	He has legal immunity, basically when the police are coming or whatever, you can instantly get them to go away.
1743388	1748092	He has the Holy Escort, which is this Harrier jet that makes him invincible or something.
1748712	1756177	And Press Relations, which you can basically just pull a publicity stunt and get everyone to forget about stuff.
1756465	1756845	Beautiful.
1757366	1757966	Beautiful, beautiful.
1758026	1758306	All right.
1758607	1758887	You know what?
1759047	1761089	I need some real morality here on this show.
1761189	1762310	I need some real morality.
1762470	1766873	And I turned to DarkSakura to bring that morality to this program.
1767514	1770376	And she provides that for us every week with her weekly advice column.
1770716	1772758	Because, you know, there is more to life than just gaming.
1773098	1778322	Because if you played video games all day long, you would have no time to watch the people's court.
1778923	1779283	You wouldn't.
1780245	1781305	Judge Wapner was cool.
1781486	1781706	I know.
1781786	1783366	Even that new lady that's on it is pretty awesome.
1783546	1784006	She's pretty awesome.
1784026	1784827	I just don't watch TV.
1785267	1785467	I know.
1785887	1788168	Anyway, so DarkSakura, what are you going to be telling the kids about tonight?
1790209	1796611	Today's bit of advice is excuses you can make for falling asleep at your desk at work and then how to fake being asleep at work.
1796991	1797332	Awesome.
1797712	1798212	I need this.
1798312	1798932	I need to know this.
1799853	1802394	To be asleep at your desk, first of all, blame work.
1802874	1806015	Say, I'm so exhausted I was here until midnight last night.
1806395	1808676	Do not attempt this if your boss works late and you do not.
1809616	1813397	You know, I had a fellow co-worker actually say that to me the other day.
1814617	1816097	I wonder if that was something they were doing.
1816477	1818698	Number two, blame medication.
1819098	1821858	Claim that your new allergy medicine has been making you drowsy.
1822018	1824119	Say, those antihistamines just knock me out.
1825039	1826299	It usually works for me because I take Benadryl.
1827679	1829019	Number three, blame lunch.
1829440	1832460	Say, wow, I guess I should not have eaten that turkey sandwich.
1832800	1836641	Tryptophan always makes me sleepy, which is true.
1836761	1837381	It is a sedative.
1837421	1837721	Mm-hmm.
1838591	1840272	Be aware when taking a nap.
1840452	1844215	Always rest your elbow on your desk and keep your arm perpendicular to the desktop.
1844755	1846737	Your forehead should rest on your four fingers.
1846977	1850299	Your thumb, spread apart from the fingers, should support your jaw.
1850960	1853281	This position will keep your head up and aimed at your desk.
1854082	1859305	Face in a direction so that it is not immediately visible to someone approaching your desk that your eyes are closed.
1860066	1865289	Keep an important group of documents in your perceived line of sight so as to appear to be reading intently.
1866470	1867771	You know, this also worked in high school.
1869483	1876085	My final piece of advice, do not stay up all night playing Final Fantasy XI, you freaking addicts.
1877145	1881786	Or World of Warcraft, or Ragnarok, or whatever the kids are playing these days.
1882566	1884647	I never let that get in the way of my sleep.
1886647	1890468	Except when I was unemployed and had no excuse to go to bed.
1891118	1893799	We've got some music game news for you guys tonight.
1893819	1897180	Because, you know, Orange Lounge, we were all about the music games when we started.
1897200	1899860	We still are to some extent, but we talk about other video games too.
1899900	1901841	But this is some big music game news.
1902221	1903581	We've got Guitar Hero.
1904062	1905582	It's that brand new game coming out.
1905602	1912584	For those of you guys that were wishing and hoping that they would make, like, Amplitude or Frequency, like a new one, from what I understand, they kind of have.
1912604	1915485	They kind of did make a new one, except it just involves a guitar.
1915865	1916805	And it's called Guitar Hero.
1916845	1918505	And Red Octane's the company that's putting this out.
1918545	1920386	Red Octane, of course, famous for making a lot of
1920751	1923312	Music Game Peripherals, and Harmonix.
1923352	1926494	Harmonix being the folks that did bring us Amplitude.
1926554	1929055	Harmonix developed the game, absolutely.
1929675	1931096	And made Karaoke Revolution as well.
1931916	1936439	Harmonix just wrapped up work on Guitar Hero, and Red Octane is going to put it out.
1936739	1938700	It's scheduled to be out November 8th.
1939280	1939960	Should be interesting.
1939980	1948685	A lot of licensed songs in this game, including More Than a Feelin' by Boston, ZZ Top, Sharp Dressed Man, and Franz Ferdinand's Take Me Out.
1949065	1949305	Now,
1950080	1950720	I had other commitments.
1950740	1951521	I had other commitments.
1969935	1971196	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1998650	2001692	Anyway, back away from my nerddom.
2002973	2005275	It has an excellent song list.
2006696	2014742	I played I Wanna Be Sedated, and then I played More Than a Feelin', which I love Boston, and I love the Ramones.
2014943	2019626	There was also Stevie Ray Vaughan in it, Franz Ferdinand, Megadeth.
2020547	2024270	It's not the actual bands, but the folks that they had playing the music was just...
2024824	2025244	Smoke on the Water
2053935	2057916	and Iron Man.
2058556	2058816	Cool.
2059656	2061496	And I want to say take me out.
2063237	2064757	And just really cool.
2065597	2069618	Really fun game to get into since I'm a big fan of Guitar Freaks.
2070278	2075419	This is definitely a step in the right direction because I like how they have the extra buttons on there so it is a little bit more difficult.
2075539	2081260	So for those people that did actually master Guitar Freaks, this is a whole new challenge for you.
2081667	2089110	Yeah, I'm just... I didn't get to play it, unfortunately, but I'm just excited that we're getting, like, Amplitude, but, like, different with a new peripheral.
2089150	2090431	I'm just... because I love Frequency.
2090451	2091091	I loved Amplitude.
2091131	2091831	I'm kind of excited.
2092011	2099575	Being that I heavily imported all the Guitar Freaks games that I could get my hands on except for the FNs, there's no comparison.
2099635	2102196	This game, Guitar Hero, really blows it out of the water.
2102436	2109319	The music quality, being that you're going from basically MIDI to real, you know, instruments...
2109830	2113653	Guitar Freaks has also just kind of gotten stale over like 13 mixes or something like that, right?
2113793	2115114	It's like Simon.
2115234	2116075	It's like playing Simon.
2116555	2119177	You know, press the button in the right order.
2119837	2125942	But this, because you've got the five keys and on top of that, the way that you move your hand, they're calling them fret buttons, I think.
2127122	2128343	You've got a whammy bar on it.
2128383	2130585	Jeez, how much cooler can you get?
2131606	2135488	I mean, I know I'm gushing about it, but I've got my game on reserve already.
2136049	2137470	The controller itself is...
2138602	2140943	Suitably more substantial than the Guitar Freaks controller.
2153686	2154286	They're the horns.
2182120	2188625	24 Hour Fitness is going to put DDR machines in their kids club portions of the gyms.
2188825	2193529	I don't think they have kids club at all, the gyms, but the ones that do, some of them are going to have DDR machines.
2193709	2198473	So an interesting fusion there between Dance Dance Revolution and a legitimate gymnasium.
2198913	2199413	Interesting, huh?
2199453	2204698	I think that it's a fascinating marketing tool, and it's sort of one that we've seen it coming.
2205318	2210022	With all the schools that are putting DDR machines in their fitness programs...
2211307	2212348	It was inevitable.
2212368	2221155	Well, Konami was also working on DDR Studio, I think it was, where it was going to be like an eight-person DDR thing, and it was crazy.
2221195	2222296	It was meant for gyms.
2222716	2227320	Although we didn't really see if this ever got actually implemented, it's interesting to see this partnership take place.
2228140	2229841	I still think Pada Pada would have been a better choice.
2231343	2232524	Yeah, but that, no.
2233184	2236026	Get your upper body moving, but then you'd have to listen to the music.
2236387	2238868	There's nothing wrong with the Eurobeat.
2239069	2239589	I'm kidding.
2239649	2240510	I watch Initial D.
2241755	2243695	Rhythm Gymnastics, the game.
2244796	2246076	Rhythm Masters.
2246916	2248997	Now you guys have some news on Dead or Alive 4.
2249457	2250317	I want to hear this stuff.
2250637	2252037	DarkSakura, what did you have on Dead or Alive 4?
2252698	2253898	DOA 4.
2254078	2256338	Well, their lobby system has been revealed.
2257759	2260179	Famitsu was talking about it.
2261680	2264560	The description that I have seen is that it is wacky.
2265201	2268261	The lobby features 10 various areas.
2268301	2271002	There's like a Halloween theme, a swamp room that you swim through.
2272060	2277661	Which, you know, honestly, it totally just fits, you know, what I would have expected.
2277701	2280202	I mean, if they gave us a volleyball, they'd have to do something goofy.
2281542	2283242	You also have various avatars.
2283282	2284723	I believe that there is around 30.
2285123	2291464	You also can have, like, a ninja, ghost, cat, penguin.
2291684	2292464	You get a penguin, Rob?
2292764	2293064	Awesome.
2294345	2301526	And each lobby can hold a maximum of 20 people, and you can chat with people and watch fights that are taking place on a widescreen display.
2302435	2307981	No screenshots yet, but of course there's shots of the game out there.
2308342	2310124	But it was in the recent issue of Famitsu.
2310566	2310926	Interesting.
2310966	2315770	Before I get to Loki's side, I just want to say something real quick about Famitsu Magazine, because it kind of relates to Xbox.
2315790	2320073	They actually just did a study on how the Japanese are kind of looking at the next generation of systems.
2322215	2324576	24% say that they do want to get an Xbox 360.
2325357	2326558	40% are still undecided.
2326938	2329300	PlayStation 3, way ahead still.
2329620	2336205	But it's just interesting because the Xbox is making a little bit of progress, because the Xbox One, or whatever you want to call it, the regular Xbox, kind of
2336581	2336721	D.O.A.
2358275	2360136	Female character, I believe from Halo 2.
2361097	2364799	And it, I mean, to be honest, looks exactly like Master Chief.
2364819	2365580	Looks exactly like Master Chief.
2365800	2368142	So you get to play this game with this character.
2368902	2376327	They said that possibly some alternate costumes that might reveal more of her, you know.
2376507	2379689	We are forgetting what DOA is all about.
2379729	2383191	Of course they put in a female Master Chief.
2383652	2384032	Of course.
2384632	2387514	If I'm a betting man, I'm going to say the code is probably Justin Bailey.
2390118	2395925	Yeah, but I don't think that was it Tecmo had anything to do with Metroid?
2397466	2397767	Whatever.
2398187	2401431	Anyway, moving on, I got a quick news for you guys.
2401451	2404294	It relates to Final Fantasy Advent Children.
2406920	2410642	700,000 copies sold since September 14th when it came out in Japan.
2411223	2414785	And 7 million copies pirated on BitTorrent in the U.S.
2415726	2416547	Just kidding.
2416607	2417087	Just kidding.
2417127	2417467	I don't know.
2417527	2418148	I don't know for sure.
2418408	2422371	And don't forget, there's a big pre-order push for that.
2422551	2430637	And then today on the Advent Children Release date, you know, it's basically now the end of January.
2430857	2432379	I think January 29th is what I heard.
2433579	2434340	But then I could be wrong.
2434750	2435710	Oh my, again?
2435911	2436111	No.
2436191	2436771	End of January.
2436891	2437631	Are they foolish?
2437691	2438972	Because this thing's all over the internet.
2439372	2441793	Unless they're going back to add extra content to make us want to get the DVD.
2441873	2442153	I don't know.
2442514	2447876	I think they're going to be pushing, I'm hoping that it's going to be a theater release.
2448116	2456440	They're actually, I have heard from other, though I cannot say who, reputable sources that are saying that it's going to be a limited theater run.
2457921	2458481	Well, that would be good.
2459951	2460572	Maybe IMAX?
2461093	2464701	I remember mentioning that a while back that I had heard that IMAX was what they were gunning for.
2465843	2468028	That might just be a fanboy's wet dream.
2468068	2468449	I don't know.
2468609	2469010	We'll see.
2469170	2469752	It's my wet dream.
2470069	2471770	Anyway, thanks for sharing.
2473391	2478475	Moving on, DarkSakura, you have some news about what's going on in the UK in release dates.
2478835	2479415	I sure do.
2479515	2480496	I have our release dates.
2481677	2486140	This is going to be, all of these games are to be released on the 21st.
2486700	2497848	We have Buzz the Music Quiz on PS2, Cold War for PC and Xbox, Crash Tag Team Racing, Dragon Ball Z, Budokai Tenkaichi,
2500509	2501910	I think I know how to pronounce Japanese.
2503511	2508033	Dual Master, Shadow of the Code, Fear, which I know a lot of people are looking forward to.
2509154	2512955	Fable, The Lost Chapters, Genji, which is already out over here.
2513836	2514036	L.A.
2514096	2527783	Rush for PS2, Xbox, Marvel Nemesis, Rise of the Imperfects, Namco Museum, Battle Collection, Pokemon Emerald, Rengoku, UFO, Aftershock, WRC Rally Edition, and X3 Reunion.
2528724	2529885	Another couple of notables.
2530365	2532728	The 28th, we have Dancing Stage Mario Mix.
2533389	2538414	We have Makai Kingdom, Chronicles of the Sacred Tome for PS2.
2538774	2539916	Pack and roll on the 28th.
2540836	2545159	You mentioned Fable in there, or Fable Lost Chapters, which is out here already.
2545520	2547461	But I just have one quick minor bitch about Fable.
2547581	2548602	It doesn't work with my TV.
2549022	2550123	It looks like garbage on my TV.
2550203	2552725	Like my HD wigs out on it.
2552885	2554547	Like there's something weird about the mode it uses.
2554947	2556848	I hope the 360 doesn't do the same thing.
2557269	2560731	But that's the only game that I have problems with out of my collection.
2560771	2561352	I have quite a few games.
2561372	2562132	Get the Lost Chapters.
2562272	2562813	It's coming out.
2562953	2564254	I don't want the Lost Chapters.
2564294	2565415	I want to play the one I bought.
2565895	2567697	No, you want the Lost Chapters.
2567857	2568057	Yeah.
2568417	2571058	See something also November, just that might be a little fun.
2571518	2573759	SingStar 80s for the PS2.
2573939	2574479	SingStar.
2575159	2576920	And Donkey Kong Country 3 for the GBA.
2578740	2580821	I like... Cool, it's Donkey Kong Country.
2580841	2581421	Alright.
2581761	2582642	Yeah.
2583082	2594226	You also had something about Alien Hamed, which was a game that's out here, but... They are releasing downloadable level packs for owners of Alien Hamed for the Xbox.
2595246	2595306	Um...
2596598	2602921	Some of the level packs are saying there's the chicken pack and the Ultra Hyper Load, both containing 25 levels.
2603802	2606923	And so far, it sounds like there are going to be free downloads.
2607183	2611306	When I said Ultra Hyper Load, I was just picturing a long-ass loading screen.
2612566	2616728	Alien Hamednid, or whatever it's called, not a game that I was very interested in.
2616968	2620230	I watched Loki play it for a length of time, and I thought, how boring.
2620832	2624193	I love the comments on here, just a quote from Eurogamer.
2624733	2628334	Mothers, buying your kids 2D shooters will make them better geeks in years to come.
2631514	2635655	I have some news regarding Castlevania, because I've been playing, of course, the DS one a lot.
2635935	2640096	Well, there are brand new Castlevania games coming out for the Xbox and PlayStation 2.
2641436	2643457	It's Curse of Darkness is the game coming out.
2643837	2644977	Should be very cool there.
2645307	2655431	It's set three years after Castlevania III, Dracula's Curse, and Curse of Darkness follows, I guess, a new character, Hector, a former minion of Dracula.
2655551	2656271	Should be interesting.
2656811	2658212	November 1st is the day.
2658392	2660893	That's just around the corner.
2661213	2660893	$49.99.
2661813	2664254	M for Mature, because you know it's got lots of blood and the good stuff.
2664914	2665774	Should be a good game, though.
2666335	2668635	I hope it's a little better than Lament of Innocence.
2668675	2673177	Not that Lament of Innocence was bad, but it wasn't Symphony of the Night.
2674221	2678584	I'm more looking forward to Matrix The Path of Neo coming out that same week.
2679544	2683307	I did just find something very interesting that I'm looking forward to.
2683327	2683927	What's that?
2684167	2685028	A Bone game.
2685268	2685988	You remember Bone?
2686969	2687449	The comic?
2688089	2688830	Oh, okay.
2690071	2691451	I just glanced over here.
2693893	2701558	Telltale Games Apparently they're releasing a Bone game.
2702495	2702835	Interesting.
2703715	2707237	Yeah, I will try to go into more of this next week.
2707297	2708157	I just saw this.
2708677	2712099	But I mean, for anyone who's fans of the series, it actually looks pretty cool.
2712179	2714660	I found the link on the front page of Eurogamer this week.
2714720	2716960	So I would suggest everyone check that out.
2717060	2718261	Maybe you'll get some emails on it.
2718341	2721222	Speaking of emails, togo at orangeloungeradio.com.
2721662	2724023	We get emails and we like to read some of them on the air.
2724043	2726144	We don't have time to read all of them, but we do read them all.
2727124	2729445	And we love you guys for writing us and letting us know you care.
2730709	2732650	But we want to respond to some on-air right now.
2732750	2735953	So, DarkSakura, what is in the old Orange Launch Radio mailbag?
2736514	2742399	Well, the one about comparing just how bad the video game law is.
2743380	2744481	That was actually sent to us by Rob.
2744921	2745041	Oh.
2745402	2746363	Our friend Rob with two Bs.
2746703	2749645	Yes, he's king of our forums lately, too.
2749706	2750286	He's a nice guy.
2750506	2753329	A great addition to our forums, yeah.
2753489	2755411	Also, we have one from...
2756109	2758090	Paul in Belfast, Northern Ireland.
2758391	2758851	Oh, right on.
2759972	2762414	I'm really glad to hear we've got listeners so far.
2762434	2763014	International.
2763054	2764455	I love hearing from the international folks.
2764795	2766036	He has a question for us.
2766276	2766977	Ooh, okay.
2767197	2768858	I will just read this.
2769278	2776063	My question is, have you ever given it some thought of doing a video of your podcast for us to download on PSP like they do with Dignation?
2776784	2779125	It would be totally cool, just a thought.
2779726	2779806	Um...
2780874	2787117	Here's the problem with Videocast, is that it's more money to get a video set up and all that stuff.
2788018	2789419	I would love to do it.
2789839	2793741	It's just a matter, the execution is, how in the hell are we going to do something like that?
2793761	2804447	I mean, when you're talking about Dig and stuff like that, I mean, that's backed by people who have been in the television industry already, so they kind of have, you know, their ties on how to do it, do that kind of stuff.
2805866	2806906	We don't really have that.
2807146	2813328	I've got a little crappy 15-year-old recorder, but I don't know what kind of a TV show we could do with that.
2813568	2818590	Plus, it's a lot, lot more time because I have worked in television in college and stuff.
2818950	2819630	It is a lot more time.
2819870	2822171	Preparing stuff for the Internet is not fun either.
2822271	2830334	I'm willing to do it, but again, it's just a matter of the fact that we have a budget of $0 and no place to shoot it.
2832274	2838420	that once I get my camcorder, I think that it might eventually be feasible to do a special.
2838600	2839721	It's in the back of our minds.
2839841	2840401	We want to do it.
2840622	2848108	And that place we were at, that warehouse we were at the other night, I thought would be a fabulous place to do an Orange Lounge type thing.
2848208	2849129	And I told you about that already.
2851311	2851991	We have ideas.
2852071	2853913	It's something that's constantly been sitting in the back of my mind.
2854053	2859798	Someday, someday, especially with this new iTunes 6.0 and the way that they're really pushing video now with the new video iPods.
2860330	2863651	and of course we like PSPs as well and we've been trying to support that.
2864911	2866532	It's a natural evolution of the show.
2866732	2867652	I want to see it happen.
2867672	2869473	It's just not going to happen cheaply.
2869573	2871013	That means I have to go buy a veil.
2872113	2873074	Any other mails?
2874054	2875954	Yeah, one last one tonight.
2877795	2879755	One of our listeners, Joseph, wrote in.
2879775	2881456	He's one of the ones who wrote.
2881536	2882156	Oh, he won.
2882176	2883436	The rare CD.
2883496	2885497	By the way, those prizes are on their way.
2886962	2897667	He would like for us to plug that they're having their Poly Bimani Games Day at Cal Poly in San Luis Obispo.
2898207	2901048	I hope I pronounced that right because I'm not from here.
2901848	2906410	It's at the Chumash Auditorium inside the University Union at Cal Poly State.
2909291	2910572	They've asked us to go, right?
2910772	2910972	Yeah.
2911072	2913293	But you're going to be busy with the Podcast Awards that weekend.
2913353	2919194	I actually am going to be at the Podcast Awards on the 11th and staying in San Diego to go buy wine.
2919895	2922175	And I might be putting in an appearance.
2922295	2927357	I have to check my calendar, see if I can do it feasibly, but I would like to do it, so we'll see.
2928177	2929637	I'll get back to these folks.
2929657	2932038	I'm still seeing, yeah.
2932058	2933439	Yeah.
2933939	2934419	We'll see.
2934739	2936560	Loki's a little harder to get to do the PR things.
2938912	2940253	Gee, I wonder why.
2941053	2941614	I want to do it.
2941634	2942334	It sounds like fun.
2942634	2943074	We'll see.
2944535	2950238	I'm not coming by myself, though, so I'm bringing a random... I might have to bring Extifer from Orange Lounge Radio's live show.
2950278	2951799	That would be hilarious.
2952319	2952699	We'll see.
2952759	2953099	We'll see.
2953560	2953880	We'll do it.
2954020	2954940	Take the Digicam with you.
2955361	2956281	If I go, I definitely will.
2956581	2957942	I'll get in touch with this guy on email.
2958182	2962724	But, yeah, I'm already going to the podcast awards, or I would be more than thrilled to go.
2962744	2967687	I also would like to go to the podcast awards, but I can't, but that's a very bitter subject, so we won't go there.
2969033	2970794	Yeah, real life sucks sometimes.
2970814	2971294	What can you say?
2971574	2973295	I have some more fun, though.
2973495	2973995	Oh, okay, good.
2974295	2974795	I want fun.
2974835	2976396	You remember our friend Steven Spielberg?
2979017	2980537	Didn't we have lunch with him last week?
2981137	2982598	I told him to kiss my ass.
2982618	2983738	I want more money for the show.
2984599	2990121	I ran into, well, not ran into him, but I was eating dinner at Skywalker Ranch.
2990941	2993222	George Lucas walked past us, and I almost flipped.
2993242	2995403	You tell that Lucas story every chance you get.
2995423	2995943	It was cool.
2997068	2997508	Oh, that's cool.
2997588	2999369	Oh my god, he's a meatless flicking distance.
2999389	3000450	Alright, tell us about Spielberg.
3000630	3002391	Okay, just a little quickie.
3002511	3009315	He has basically signed a deal with Electronic Arts to publish three original game properties.
3010256	3012177	Will they be overrated like his movies?
3013118	3015439	Likely, but only time will tell.
3015459	3016600	Ooh, I'm looking forward to it.
3017060	3018681	Well, it wouldn't be an original property.
3018701	3020102	Yeah, it's going to be original.
3020342	3021202	No Indiana Jones.
3021262	3022303	I want War of the Worlds.
3023251	3032498	He has been quoted as saying the new technology represents the future of cinema, and in the future you will physically be inside the experience.
3035040	3036200	Inside the experience.
3036721	3042965	Another thing they were asking how it's going to work, he said, I invented it, but because the patent is pending, I can't discuss it right now.
3044226	3047489	Hopefully being inside the experience includes Pam Landerson.
3049224	3051486	Moving on, moving on.
3052587	3056711	Let's get to a story that Loki's got about PSP on the TV.
3056771	3058353	It's something that you've been following for a little while.
3058753	3062116	Yes, everybody wants the PSP to be on the TV.
3062196	3066080	I mean, it's only, you've got the UMD movies, which are selling like crazy, of course.
3066761	3074368	The first thing, of course, they have the PSP2 TV, which is actually kind of a,
3075166	3075746	I don't know.
3075786	3076947	I don't know about that working.
3077007	3077327	Sounds crazy.
3077347	3077447	Okay.
3077467	3081609	But it doesn't require modification, and I think that's kind of the selling point of it.
3081669	3081929	Okay, okay.
3081949	3082249	That's cool.
3104632	3110155	You also had a story about a mod for the Nintendo, with the GBA Micro being so popular right now.
3110235	3110455	Yes.
3110996	3123923	Actually, the guy behind all those portable systems, like the portable Atari, Ben Heck, he actually created a brand new NES Micro, as he calls it.
3124963	3128465	They've got screenshots on his site here on BenHeck.com.
3128505	3129986	The NES Micro is like...
3131937	3132517	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3161106	3161447	DarkSakura
3185140	3185760	Yes.
3186100	3195263	However, they're saying that other than the game stores currently in existence, the GameStop ones, they're not going to have that big of a presence.
3195283	3196463	They're not going to really shift things.
3196543	3202004	And from what I've heard, a lot of the EBs are still going to stay and keep operating under the EB name.
3202344	3202824	Oh, interesting.
3203144	3209246	So that explains what's going to happen when you have a mall and you have EB, which is right up... We have here in Sacramento, we have a mall...
3209881	3215644	We have a mall where there's a GameStop and then right around the corner there's an EB next to the Cinnabon.
3216405	3218005	I don't think either of those stores are going anywhere.
3219646	3224709	People probably wondered, with a merger, is EB going to be GameStop and you just have two GameStops in the mall?
3225029	3225890	Which would be a little crazy.
3226170	3231513	I believe it's still operating under... From what I understood, they were supposed to dissolve the EB name.
3231633	3233414	However, the EB stores are still there.
3233594	3235315	So I don't know how they're going to manage that.
3235495	3235815	Interesting.
3236275	3240017	Let's say I have GameStop A and GameStop B. GameStop A and GameStop B. And for the record.
3240557	3242718	It could be like Express Men and Express Women.
3242738	3246539	They could have GameStop Nintendo and GameStop Xbox and GameStop Sony.
3246559	3247239	It would be interesting.
3247299	3251381	I do need to correct myself, though, as far as Barnes & Noble's involvement in that.
3251461	3256243	GameStop is now a fully functioning business.
3256503	3259864	They're still associated with Barnes & Noble, but they are their own business.
3260525	3260985	Very interesting.
3261365	3263626	No longer a fully owned subsidy, I should say.
3264442	3268704	I got one last story for you guys, and then we'll let Loki finish this out tonight, because I think his thing's a little bit cooler.
3269704	3271265	My last thing is Soul Calibur 3.
3272085	3273266	I can't believe I saved this for last.
3273286	3273966	This is big news.
3274606	3277787	Soul Calibur 3, though, for me, it feels like it's been flying under the radar a little bit.
3277827	3283289	Maybe it's just because I'm not following the same news I used to, but I remember Soul Calibur 2 was like this huge freaking deal.
3283730	3289612	Soul Calibur 3, certainly if you're a fighting game fan, is still a huge deal, but this one's kind of been seeming to fly under the radar for me, but...
3290112	3291733	It's still going to look like a cool game nonetheless.
3291833	3295976	Maybe it's because, A, it doesn't have Link in it, and B... Link was cool!
3296076	3297777	I know, but he wasn't the whole game.
3297837	3299899	I mean, the arcade version of Soul Calibur II was awesome.
3300379	3302200	Ivy is the whole game, really, is what it was.
3302220	3304482	The Xbox version of Soul Calibur II was awesome.
3305142	3307704	Anyway, Soul Calibur III is for the PlayStation 2.
3308064	3310726	It's coming out October 25th, which I was kind of surprised.
3310746	3312087	I was like, whoa, that was quick.
3313047	3314268	Also rated T14, $49.99.
3314608	3319512	Of course, the big thing about this is that you're going to be able to do, you know, some...
3320575	3321256	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3341437	3342558	via Flash on the internet.
3342578	3343739	Like the old-ass Prince of Persia.
3343779	3345239	We're not talking the Sands of Time.
3345259	3352604	What do you mean by the Prince of Persia that was on the NES, the Commodore 64, the Apple, the Game Boy?
3353145	3355166	It was on every system ever at that time.
3355186	3355626	That's correct.
3356327	3364692	You can find us at www.gamespot.com slash promo slash princeofpersia dash game slash flash
3366454	3366774	That's it.
3367734	3368255	Interesting.
3368415	3370515	Slash partridge in a pear tree dot org.
3371896	3372096	All right.
3372156	3372876	Check that out, you guys.
3372976	3373576	Dot EU.
3374016	3374276	All right.
3375117	3376857	A couple really quick things.
3377838	3385360	PSP firmware 2.5 came out that allows the movies on the go type thing where you can stream over the internet.
3385380	3387541	Too bad that the peripheral that you need to use that is $350.
3387581	3387661	Ouch.
3387681	3388221	That sucks for everybody.
3392438	3394279	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3414133	3414973	I need to play more games this week.
3415013	3416154	SSX on tour looks awesome.
3416174	3416514	I can't wait.
3442881	3445242	My final thought is World of Warcraft, setting things on fire.
3445342	3446283	Full report next week.
3446803	3447343	DarkSakura.
3448984	3449925	Reject false icons.
3450965	3451445	And that's all.
3452626	3453186	And one more thing.
3453626	3455167	More fun stuff coming to the PSP site.
3455187	3456148	You had your last thought.
3457808	3458169	All right.
3458749	3461230	Yes, check out the PSP site, olrpsp.com.
3461250	3461850	We haven't plugged that yet.
3462391	3463111	You know what, though?
3463351	3466093	We have barely heard from somebody this entire show.
3466533	3466933	Who's that?
3468345	3470406	Yes, our little pet ferret.
3470426	3471086	What are those things called?
3471126	3471466	Scoozies?
3471546	3471966	Scoozies.
3471986	3473327	He's our mascot, the ferret.
3473487	3475388	You see him in the little album art for our show.
3475428	3476908	You see him, like really, really tiny.
3476968	3477509	The ferret.
3478189	3479169	I have just been sad.
3479389	3481130	Now I've been reunited with my ferret friend.
3481390	3481750	All right.
3482031	3482491	We're done.
3482711	3483031	We're done.
3483051	3484391	Thanks for downloading us.
3484512	3486192	Check us out next week.
3486232	3487573	We'll be back, as always.
3487733	3489113	Have we ever missed a week?
3489173	3490554	I don't know.
3490594	3491374	I want a vacation.
3491454	3492375	When do I get a vacation?
3492435	3494195	You missed one show.
3494696	3495296	One show.
3495856	3496056	All right.
3496076	3497277	Anyway, that's it.
3497357	3498197	See you guys next time.
3499801	3503347	That's the end of another Orange Lounge Radio To Go edition.
