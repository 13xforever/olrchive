13257	16700	We're going to talk a lot about a follow-up to something we did last week.
17120	19502	Talking about Orange Lounge Radio jumping the shark.
20043	21103	For reals, yo.
21584	23866	We didn't jump the shark as much as we landed on it.
24486	27769	You didn't jump the shark as much as I thought you were going to.
27849	29351	It's going to all make sense tonight.
29371	31913	We're going to finally reveal what happened this week and why.
33283	35865	Why you guys are going to really get a kick out of this.
36745	38867	Also on this show, the ferret comes out of the closet.
40268	42769	Yes, and the ferret is getting his own show on Logo.
43169	43670	Go figure.
45891	49654	Also, I have a secret, and I'm going to tell you my secret.
50574	51855	My secret is that I'm gay.
51995	52435	No, I'm kidding.
52816	53596	We have a real secret.
53616	54137	No!
54157	55938	I would have never guessed.
57118	57859	All this time.
58059	60701	All this and more when we come back, so get ready.
73559	76381	Orange Lounge Radio is presented in the TMI sound format.

222888	224389	Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts.
224449	226810	Say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
227030	229891	I don't know why you're talking about all this live crap, because I feel half dead.
233953	235593	We're actually reanimated tonight.
235653	237494	We're not really alive.
237614	240955	In honor of Land of the Dead being released to DVD.
242516	244016	I must have zombie movie fest.
244076	245497	And I found my copy of Shaun of the Dead.
246717	247578	So we must all watch this.
247878	248258	Alright.
249944	255128	Also joining us tonight, the one and only, the beautiful Loki.
256469	257349	I'm beautiful today.
258210	259711	Our sex symbol on the show here.
260572	264274	Wow, that's funny.
264695	265715	I thought that was the ferret.
266276	269918	And to celebrate Loki being the sex symbol, he's actually wearing nothing but a bikini tonight.
271319	274221	And the shirt and pants, minus the bikini.
274261	277624	Again, reasons why we need to be a TV show.
279110	282773	So all of you out there can see through the lies.
283133	284234	All the lies.
288277	291859	We won't be able to see through the lies because we'll be blinded by your white ass.
292940	294001	My ass is not that white.
294821	295702	I'll take your word for it.
295882	297003	What, do you tan your ass?
297483	298324	I don't tan my ass.
299365	301886	Are you a nude sunbather?
302607	303628	I don't sunbathe at all.
303648	305029	That involves going outside.
305749	306570	I don't like outside.
308496	311158	Alright, say hello to our special guest tonight.
311698	314079	The one, the only, DDR Angel.
314099	315700	Hello.
315921	316261	How are you?
316721	317101	Good.
317341	318202	How are you today?
318222	319163	I'm playing Nintendogs.
319323	320243	You're playing Nintendogs?
320523	323585	My Nintendogs, I think, floated to the top of the bowl, finally.
323865	325707	I got a Dalmatian.
327087	327908	I named him Ikea.
328695	331777	I know, that wasn't my suggestion.
331797	334259	My suggestion was Alpo, that you name your dog Alpo.
334379	336660	You wouldn't name him Alpo and he wouldn't respond to Alpo.
337221	340323	So I named him Ikea after what looked like meatballs all over his body.
341263	343204	It was better than naming him, you know, Smallpox.
346567	351430	Also, in studio, say hello to the one and only, newly shaven, by the way.
351450	358034	That's what threw me off, is that Extaper was telling me earlier today that he was never going to shave off his beard, and he fucking did it!
358679	359399	I did it.
360180	361300	Liar, liar, pencil liar.
361380	361640	I know.
361660	363561	You look like five years younger.
363661	367182	I was going to do that little, you know, chin bacon strip thing, you know?
367442	370383	Like, is that what that's called?
371264	373504	Yeah, it's called a bacon strip when it's in another place.
373625	374065	Oh, okay.
374265	375725	Well, I call it the chin bacon strip.
375765	377666	I thought that was the Brazilian wax job.
378406	383008	No, Brazilian wax, I'll have Extrovert explain a Brazilian wax job a little later in the show.
384059	390903	Brazilian Wax Job Maybe we should leave that to Mr. Spanky God, it's going to be one of those nights Why don't you look that up on Wikipedia?
392924	411234	Okay, I'll do that right now See if Brazilian Wax Job's over on Wikipedia and you can explain that to all the kids exactly what that's all about Yeah, I just decided to shave it all off You shaved it all off?
411354	412275	I'm totally bald
414205	415107	I'm kidding.
417550	418812	Okay, yeah, anyway.
419413	421416	Tonight's show should be okay.
422358	423700	Tonight's going to be an okay show.
423780	424601	Don't get your hopes up.
425443	426524	No, I'm kidding.
426544	427245	We're going to have a good time.
427265	428187	I saw Serenity again.
428942	430522	We're going to talk about how was your week, how was your day.
430863	433703	We're going to talk about Orange Lounge Radio, Almost Jumping the Shark.
434204	435704	We're going to talk about My Little Surprise.
436244	438465	We're going to talk about a lot of stuff tonight.
438565	439645	And maybe we'll play a game.
439685	441265	We haven't played a game on the show in a while.
441286	442846	So I think we need to do some Bomani Match Game.
442866	444606	Can we also talk about opening the door?
444726	446987	Brazilian Waxing is on the Wikipedia.
447567	447847	Is it?
448488	450188	And I'm going to post it in the chat room.
450208	453189	DarkSakura is going to research Brazilian Waxing and talk to you all about it soon.
453209	455289	And X-Trooper is going to open the damn door so we can get some air in here.
455329	455590	Thank you.
456130	456490	Alright.
458120	459641	We will be back after this.
459961	463744	In this break, I have queued up some old school music.
464164	466566	So, it's just a potpourri of stuff, but it's old.
466606	467947	Like, all this shit's like three years old.
468127	469909	So, we're going to hear some old shit.
470569	471750	And stuff we don't play very often.
471770	472891	Well, our listeners are used to that.
472931	474552	They've been paying attention to us for three years.
474652	475233	Exactly.
475293	475813	Three and a half.
476670	478371	We're three and a half years.
478471	479492	We're like toddlers.
479572	481093	We're potty trained now.
481133	482053	We're learning how to read.
482073	487237	Okay, Sakurina, you know this wouldn't be the show if we didn't at least have five sexual references during the show.
487857	488838	Remember, adult.
489978	493200	Ron Shen says, Orange Lounge Radio, more sex, less Bimani.
493240	498383	Hey, in a perfect world, we would be about sex and Bimani.
501906	502346	Yeah, anyway.
502708	507893	We'll be back after this with Orange Lounge Radio where we'll talk about a lot of sex and some games.
513258	514098	We'll be back after this.
534591	536132	Thank you for watching!
563164	575812	I love you, I look at you, I hug you, I kiss you Even if it's just a casual kiss, I knew it was painful I knew there was no such thing as a painful past Once again, just a little longer, I want to watch your back
594796	598657	Piazza, Piazza, Piazza, Piazza, Piazza
662365	663137	Thank you for watching!
693393	694035	Thanks for watching!
740379	741400	Thanks for watching!
792225	792746	DarkSakura
856947	857852	DJ Ranma S,
897947	898367	Hello?
899168	900188	Hello, is this thing on?
900228	900748	Testing.
901929	902809	Testing, one, two.
903369	907331	I'm looking in the index, but I don't see anything for how to run a radio show.
907431	907892	Hello?
908572	910032	I don't understand this.
910052	911413	Does this thing work?
911433	913074	This thing reads like stereo instructions.
913094	913734	Is this on?
913754	914334	What the hell?
916876	918296	Orange Lounge Radio.
918476	920657	Broke Down Ghetto Bomani Radio.
920677	921258	What the f***?
924477	930299	We are back, and Rob had to run to the bathroom with explosive diarrhea from the burrito he ate a moment ago.
931340	933701	It really stinks, so we have the vent on and everything.
934281	943485	But I decided to go ahead and fill the gap, I would call our resident expert on all things that are very TMI, Mr. Spanky!
946286	950488	Mr. Spanky, where are you?
951528	953189	Hello, everybody!
954671	955572	Oh my god!
956233	958975	It's been forever since I've been on this show!
960717	962378	What's wrong with you people?
962778	964080	I thought you didn't love me!
964280	966542	Hello everybody, it's Mr. Spanky!
967182	970946	It's your favorite DDR dancer from DDRPC!
972447	974909	Does anybody play DDRPC anymore?
975950	978873	I'm using it to hold up the end of a table.
979253	980855	Everybody forgot about me!
981644	982384	That's okay.
982625	987447	That's okay that you people forget about Mr. Spanky because it gives me a lot of time to learn about sex.
988428	992630	And as I understand it, the kids today want to learn about Brazilian waxing.
992650	996171	So I'm going to talk a little bit about Brazilian waxing to the kids today.
996972	1003415	Except, okay, if you're like really a kid, you don't want to listen because your mom and dad might get upset with you for listening.
1003815	1006917	And anyway, Brazilian waxing has to do with your pubic hair.
1007317	1009198	And if you're a kid, you don't have pubic hair.
1009338	1010659	So this doesn't matter to you.
1012057	1015319	However, DarkSakura, I know you want to know about this stuff.
1016500	1017781	So pay attention.
1020983	1023145	Okay, so I'm going to tell you guys about Brazilian waxing.
1023205	1028189	Basically what it is, in a Brazilian wax, it's a waxing of your pubic area.
1028289	1032752	And it means you completely remove the hair around your vulva.
1034233	1036615	Okay, but you only have a vulva if you're a woman.
1037175	1039757	If you're a guy, it takes away all the hair around your penis.
1041402	1044425	Not only that though, it's not just like a pubic waxing job.
1044965	1047508	A Brazilian wax means they wax your ass too.
1047648	1050070	So they take away all the hair around your anus.
1051972	1054974	So in order for them to do this, they have to coat you in hot wax.
1055135	1059919	So they have to coat you in hot wax around your penis and your anus or your vulva if you're a girl.
1061861	1064143	So this means you have to get naked with whoever is doing it.
1064223	1066265	But some people like to get naked, so it's okay.
1067003	1072487	and so they're going to rip away all that wax and they're going to leave you with a really clean butt and penis and vagina.
1073308	1074629	Well, hopefully you don't have all three.
1078392	1088060	So anyway, this is related to a type of sexual activity called akamokliktik, which means you have a preference for hairless genitals.
1088420	1093224	And I happen to know for a fact, Extifer, who I ran into at the sex club the other night,
1094036	1096479	Have this preference for hairless genitals, don't you?
1109289	1109549	Okay.
1109869	1114692	Well, I'm going to go now, kids, so you can talk about the DDR, but I hope you learned a good lesson today.
1114772	1123917	So remember, check it out, DDR PC, Mr. Spanky, one of the downloadable characters, only $5 in the bargain bin at Freud's.
1124757	1125777	Bye, everybody!
1125918	1127498	Bye, Mr. Spanky!
1127919	1129419	Rob, get out of the bathroom!
1131660	1134962	Oh, do it all night, do it with me.
1134982	1137904	I'll take you to heaven if you make me feel free.
1137924	1138404	Make sure to
1139045	1140125	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
1169901	1171982	For any game companies that might be listening tonight.
1177163	1178103	DarkSakura, how was your week?
1178123	1178603	How was your day?
1179023	1182544	My week was fabulous in a really busy, crappy way.
1185145	1188546	I played a new game that I'm not going to talk about right now.
1189866	1192767	Dan got me the Lawyer game for DS.
1194228	1195488	I don't remember what it's called.
1196388	1199009	Phoenix Wright Attorney at Law.
1200194	1201455	And he's been playing it!
1201695	1203216	I want to see this, it sounds cool.
1203417	1207680	And apparently it's been, like, you do murder cases and shit like that.
1208841	1213484	And then, uh, I played, I tried to play Katamari, and he was like, I want to watch Star Wars.
1213925	1216987	So, because he bought, like, all the rest of the Star, not Star Wars, Star Trek movies.
1217928	1219589	So he's been, like, uber Trekkie mode.
1220090	1221671	I finished season one of Stargate.
1222411	1223152	Woo!
1223933	1225114	And then saw Serenity again.
1225134	1228076	Because I'm a big nerd.
1228156	1229317	That you are, no disputing that.
1229699	1232322	We had the Katrina relief sale on Friday night.
1232402	1232882	Yes, we did.
1233182	1239068	Sold a whole bunch of stuff, and we've managed to pull in $130 for the charity.
1239268	1239568	Woo-hoo!
1240289	1244613	So we are going to be delivering that, and all the leftovers are going to be going to the Salvation Army.
1248456	1252420	I also am going to be acquiring more things for giveaways on the show.
1253521	1253982	Very cool.
1254022	1254582	We like giveaways.
1254622	1255143	We're giving away...
1255902	1256903	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1277874	1281637	I had the assignment that she wanted us to do done, uploaded, ready.
1282118	1283439	I changed the text sizes.
1283499	1284500	I changed the fonts.
1284560	1285801	I changed the background color.
1286161	1290765	I added in line breaks and, you know, the bar thing.
1291205	1293587	And then I even put a picture on it.
1293987	1296329	So I'll be linking that in the chat room, what I did in my class.
1296389	1297270	I saw your webpage.
1297970	1302014	And I did this in, like, 15 minutes.
1302134	1303495	That's actually with two revisions.
1304199	1305200	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1328951	1332413	Four classes, working full-time, the show, and going to the gym.
1332853	1333493	Ain't gonna happen.
1334314	1336775	I also went to the gym twice this week.
1337155	1337736	Be proud of me.
1338076	1338456	Good job.
1338496	1339717	That's more times than I went to the gym.
1339777	1344219	And then I ate ice cream all day, because Baskin-Robbins has pumpkin ice cream, and everyone should go have some.
1344239	1345680	That sounds... I want to go have some.
1345740	1346280	I just might.
1348541	1349382	And that's it.
1349822	1350022	All right.
1350362	1351022	Loki, how was your week?
1351042	1351383	How was your day?
1352463	1353944	My week was okay.
1354424	1357926	Thursday, we left the Tahoe for our company's 25th anniversary.
1358875	1359696	So that was kind of cool.
1359716	1363679	We got a bunch of DVDs and stuff that I'll be turning in for more games.
1364519	1366561	Then, what was it?
1366641	1373566	Last night, we actually had a party for our 25th anniversary, and they had the coolest thing ever.
1373886	1382952	They got the guy from that show, That's My Bush, to do this long-ass speech on video, and it was hilarious.
1383012	1388116	I mean, this guy is spot-on for President Bush, so it was really cool.
1388598	1389318	Just really awesome.
1389518	1390559	And I drank lots of alcohol.
1390579	1390999	That was free.
1391499	1392719	So that was also cool.
1394160	1402503	The other thing I did this week was basically just, I don't know, try to play some more new games.
1402903	1405564	I got SSX on tour.
1406104	1406824	That was pretty cool.
1407764	1413486	And I don't know, just same old stuff, work stuff, and lots of driving.
1413706	1414707	Fucking hate driving.
1415367	1418048	And worked on the PSP webpage.
1419085	1421285	Olrpsp.com Yes.
1422386	1422906	It's sexy.
1423326	1423786	Check it out.
1423806	1425486	It's going to be even sexier soon.
1426486	1431587	Good to hear.
1432067	1434128	I made a boo-boo.
1434888	1435688	Oh well, who cares.
1436628	1439189	Maybe the chat room will notice what it is.
1439349	1439609	Oh well.
1441929	1442189	Is that it?
1442949	1443609	That'd be it.
1443649	1444510	That's all I can think of.
1444530	1445330	That was interesting.
1445850	1446550	Okay, sounds good.
1447772	1448312	How was your week?
1448332	1449053	How was your day?
1450233	1451193	It went well.
1451433	1452814	I mean, it was boring, really.
1452914	1454154	Didn't do really anything.
1456515	1456975	Worked.
1457936	1459136	Saw the family yesterday.
1460617	1464298	You know, just did my shaving thing today.
1464998	1465899	But not the Brazilian way.
1466239	1467979	No, I didn't do the Brazilian way.
1468199	1469760	I can't shave my genitals.
1470060	1472821	I mean, if I shave my genitals, I mean, I break out.
1474250	1477411	So, it doesn't look very pleasing to the eye.
1477431	1478312	It looks like herpes?
1479052	1480032	It doesn't look like herpes.
1480052	1482053	That's the purpose of wax, so you don't shave.
1482573	1485634	Well, waxing, I'm pretty sure, would make me break out, too.
1486155	1488576	Maybe, I just have really sensitive skin around the area.
1490356	1492877	So... I think we all have sensitive skin around the area.
1492937	1494078	Yeah.
1494318	1496859	Especially the penis.
1499160	1501821	And, you know, let's say... The balls.
1501841	1502401	The balls.
1505365	1514132	So that's kind of how my week... I'm reminded of that one episode of Beavis and Butthead where the gym teacher's like, Today we're going to talk about the penis!
1516694	1518076	Forget it.
1519537	1520117	How was your week?
1520157	1521038	How was your day, Angel?
1522519	1524321	My computer exploded on Friday.
1524581	1526983	It literally blew up in a giant ball of flames?
1527023	1532848	The power supply went poof, so... Angel doesn't have a computer for...
1534151	1540837	I've been having trouble with it for the last couple days.
1541818	1546442	It's been doing some weird stuff that I... So what exactly does the power supply do when it explodes?
1546882	1548484	It stinks really bad.
1556151	1558413	Comments that nobody can hear except for me.
1558433	1559674	Yeah, that's fine.
1560603	1564045	And we went to a party yesterday, but that's okay.
1565146	1569829	And it was fun and it was good to see people and stuff like that.
1571851	1572871	Yeah, I guess that's it.
1574512	1579356	I've been working in school and stuff like that.
1581737	1582618	That's it.
1583038	1587681	Oh, and I found my Final Fantasy XI discs, so you know what I'm going to be doing this week if I can get the computer running.
1587801	1588282	Hey!
1588982	1589363	Hey!
1590615	1597140	I've also been playing World of Warcraft You need to be playing World of Warcraft with me, thank you Yeah, I have that What server are you on?
1597560	1617855	Right now, I'm playing on Maelstrom, but I'm playing on Scarlet Crusade Yeah, I have one on Scarlet Crusade that I haven't logged into for a week I'm only level 7, so it's all cool Yeah, I'll wait for you to catch up to me then I'm like 32 on that server Anyway, yeah, that's it for me, I guess
1618257	1618517	Bye.
1619577	1619957	Okay, bye.
1620177	1620737	Until later.
1621878	1623358	Okay.
1623638	1624038	Let's see.
1624158	1625778	What did I do this week?
1625838	1627339	Really, not a whole lot.
1627899	1628879	I worked my ass off.
1628919	1629479	That's what I did.
1630759	1632660	And I haven't had time for a whole lot of games.
1632700	1635000	I've just been playing Castlevania DS a lot.
1635200	1635620	Slacker.
1635700	1637200	Which I kind of... Shut up.
1637600	1643921	Which I'm making very slow progress on, and I've been playing a little bit of Final Fantasy XI.
1644402	1645122	Not a lot, though.
1645502	1646802	I haven't gained a level or anything.
1646842	1646942	I'm
1647745	1650267	Final Fantasy XI is kind of annoying me, but I'll talk about that later.
1650568	1655092	Final Fantasy XI is getting very annoying, so we'll talk about that later.
1658215	1659296	I think that's really about it.
1659376	1663841	I mean, God, I went to Target like twice this weekend, which is pretty cool, because I love Target.
1664141	1665903	Is Target not the greatest store ever?
1668185	1668645	It's not.
1668665	1669146	It's the Walmart.
1669838	1670979	I don't, see, I don't like Walmart.
1670999	1671559	Oh my god.
1671599	1672460	I don't like going into Walmart.
1672480	1679405	The thing about Walmart, like, I went to my hometown this weekend, and, like, they're building the biggest-ass Walmart there.
1679465	1681287	There's, like, four entrances in the front.
1682087	1683708	It's going to be a super center.
1683789	1685770	And we're getting one, like, around the corner from my house.
1685930	1686210	Really?
1686431	1691214	Super Walmart is the best if you're poor and need groceries, because you get, like, real groceries, but they're, like, half the price.
1691274	1692215	I want Super Target.
1692735	1695717	There's a Super Target in the place that I grew up as well.
1696158	1697519	But you can't get cheap groceries.
1698371	1700152	They don't have a full grocery store in them.
1700252	1702813	And not at Target Greatland, but there's also Super Target.
1702873	1705534	It might have a different name, but there's three levels of Target.
1705554	1707975	There's regular Target, Greatland, and then Mondo Target.
1707995	1708915	Super Target!
1708935	1710816	Super Target, like really big Target.
1711196	1713737	We just need the Orange Lodge grocery store.
1713757	1717418	It has a whole video game section.
1717478	1721500	You know, my dream grocery store would be just like that old TV show, Shop Till You Drop.
1722759	1723479	That's still on.
1723679	1724459	Is that still on?
1724479	1724800	Yeah.
1724920	1725560	No way.
1725600	1728660	Is it the old ass reruns from like the early, late 80s?
1728680	1731321	No, no, they still have, it's the one that was on Lifetime, right?
1731361	1731641	Yeah.
1731801	1732741	Yeah, they still have that.
1732881	1735722	It's like on, I think it's on PAX TV.
1735802	1737182	Lifetime Television for Women.
1737463	1739983	Yeah, now it's on Lifetime Television for Christians.
1740783	1741544	You know, PAX TV.
1741604	1742204	Oh, PAX TV.
1742244	1745745	Yeah, but no, it's still on there, I believe.
1746085	1747465	Supermarket Sweep, that's what it's called.
1748433	1750174	Supermarket Sweep is bad, okay?
1750434	1752074	Oh, why was I thinking Shop Till You Drop?
1752414	1753335	That must have been another show.
1754055	1756616	I think that was one that was where they go... Oh, it was the mall.
1756676	1757656	There's the mall one, yeah.
1757676	1758756	They don't have that one anymore.
1758776	1759737	I didn't mean that one.
1759757	1760677	I meant Supermarket Sweep.
1760797	1761277	That's what I meant.
1761337	1762317	Okay, yeah, they still have that.
1762858	1764398	Supermarket Sweep is badass.
1765558	1767979	Did, like, throw in those canned hams into this cart.
1769420	1770480	It was pretty badass.
1770748	1772129	But they never ever won.
1772870	1775192	They never ever found all of the things that they needed.
1775593	1777034	They totally won on that show.
1777054	1777475	I've seen it.
1777595	1778476	Like, I didn't.
1781118	1781859	I've seen Winners.
1783801	1785142	I've seen Winners.
1785362	1786623	I can't believe I got those two shows confused.
1786884	1788145	Weren't they on in like the same hour?
1788285	1790207	Like it was like the shopping hour on Lifetime?
1790427	1791668	Yeah, I believe it was.
1791688	1792890	I figured it out.
1796087	1804950	The chat room is correcting me because there's like a minute of lag between the chat and us, which is always kind of funny because everybody's yelling, it's supermarket sweep, not chat till you drop.
1805351	1810132	Our chat room, by the way, www.orangeonsradio.com, click on chat if you want to chat away with us.
1811113	1811393	All right.
1813754	1820096	Let's start off tonight by talking about a little bit of follow-up from last week.
1820296	1820997	Bleach Deathless?
1821237	1821857	No, not that.
1822820	1839054	No, no, no, I think you should talk about Bleach Hustle No, I'm done with the sex talk for tonight, Jesus I'm not I know you're never done with the sex talk, that's your problem Alright, let's talk about what happened this week with Orange Launch Radio Jamie, do you want to kind of set this story up?
1839715	1840115	What happened?
1841436	1842317	Is this about Thursday?
1842717	1848302	Yes Okay, last week I got an email Well, technically the week before
1848718	1849238	RedOctane
1877890	1880451	Now instantly we're like, is this in the groove?
1881932	1882453	No, it wasn't.
1883913	1889396	But admittedly, until Thursday, I was operating on the assumption that yes, it was going to be in the groove and another game.
1889796	1898941	So that's why I was commenting last week that you guys are going to get a big kick out of this because we're going to be talking about in the groove on TV and getting our honest, unedited opinion on the game.
1899582	1901403	But no, instead it's another game.
1902899	1911711	On Thursday, in my living room, which everyone can now see the awesomeness of my red couches, we played Guitar Hero.
1912792	1915015	And that game is awesome.
1915776	1920422	So I didn't get to do this because of a scheduling conflict, meaning my boss wouldn't give me the day off work.
1922506	1924027	You guys got to go play Guitar Hero.
1924507	1927148	So you and Loki are going to be in a segment.
1927188	1927888	When's this going to air?
1927908	1928208	Do we know?
1928468	1929149	In a couple weeks.
1929189	1934210	I was told I'm still waiting on the confirmation email from... I actually worked with another project manager.
1934410	1934890	Okay, cool.
1934930	1937251	So we'll actually post this on the site, obviously, when it's ready.
1937872	1939152	We'll let you guys know about this.
1940032	1940793	So what's the deal?
1940833	1942313	What happened with Guitar Hero?
1942333	1942793	What's it like?
1942853	1943453	Tell us all about it.
1943694	1950276	Well, first of all, everyone needs a picture in their head what the... And I'm going to use the easiest...
1951289	1951849	Comparison.
1952329	1955191	The controller, imagine the Guitar Freaks controller.
1955891	1961753	Now imagine the body style license from Gibson, as in a real guitar shape.
1961933	1963874	Five buttons and a whammy bar.
1965214	1966415	So yeah, it's pretty awesome.
1967035	1971477	And the way that you move your hands, it has an interface, because the game is put up by Harmonix.
1973137	1976618	The people who gave us frequency and amplitude.
1976658	1977258	Why did I say res?
1977978	1982560	But it has a very similar interface where the keys are coming toward you.
1983140	1985140	But on your easiest difficulty, you have three.
1985961	1987121	Then it goes to four on medium.
1987161	1989382	Then it's five and up for the harder difficulties.
1989442	1992162	If I remember correctly, I think it's three for easy.
1992722	1995583	Medium is three with the occasional fourth.
1996003	1997724	Well, it goes up to four for medium.
1997744	1998504	That's just what I just said.
1999064	2000104	Yeah.
2001165	2001465	Anyway...
2003101	2008604	But the way that you're moving your hands on it as you play it has a very, very real guitar feel to it.
2009284	2012025	They even go so far as to what they call it fret buttons.
2015327	2021010	The little switch for where your strings would be is actually called the strum bar and you have your whammy bar.
2021290	2024331	It's built with micro switches in it so you can actually hold them.
2024371	2027833	You have notes that you hold like you're really strumming them.
2027873	2028993	It's really pretty cool.
2029374	2031635	You build up your meter by wailing hard.
2032751	2033871	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2048434	2051776	They have them grouped as groups of five songs in each difficulty class.
2052136	2052237	Oh.
2052917	2057300	And then as you play, but you can actually do each song on it at different difficulties too.
2057680	2064904	So you will basically judge, you can work up through the list on easy and then work up through the list on medium and actually get your challenge out of it that way.
2064924	2065785	That's kind of a weird setup.
2065805	2068547	So it's not like a giant song wheel like we're used to in the Babylon games?
2068827	2068867	No.
2068967	2073490	In this game, if Guitar Freaks were a 10...
2074608	2080110	This game would blow that scale apart and put it up, you know, it would be 100 on a scale of 1 to 10, I think.
2080391	2080551	Wow.
2080651	2081311	It's really awesome.
2081771	2084252	Now, wait, is it set up like frequency and amplitude then?
2084272	2084412	Yes.
2084853	2086613	Okay, that's how like frequency and amplitude are.
2086653	2090775	It's like groups of five and then you play through it and there's like a bonus song you might unlock at the end?
2090795	2091856	The bonus songs are actually...
2093116	2093677	All originals.
2094077	2095117	Original songs.
2095258	2101461	So this sounds to me like it's pretty much Frequently in Amplitude, we finally get our sequel, except now it's a guitar game.
2102202	2107425	And they are actually only going to be sold with the guitar, with a price of retail $69.99.
2109426	2116209	But the guitar controller is the best controller of any type of non-traditional peripheral I have ever, ever seen.
2116609	2122531	It actually has substance and weight to it, not like heavy, heavy, but it definitely feels more substantial than the Guitar Freaks controllers, honestly.
2123951	2125772	The song list was fabulous.
2125952	2127493	I mean, it was just really awesome stuff.
2127513	2131154	Were there like actual songs in it, or was it mostly like karaoke-style covers?
2131454	2132655	They were remakes, however.
2132715	2133435	They were done...
2134358	2135759	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2155754	2163097	because Harmonix obviously also had a big hand in Karaoke Revolution and the remakes or whatever they did for Karaoke Revolution were not bad.
2163477	2164137	They weren't bad.
2164657	2167478	I mean, obviously not the original, but they're not bad, all things considered.
2167498	2168659	I've heard much worse remakes.
2169099	2172720	So kind of that same level of quality going into Guitar Hero then.
2173560	2174041	Pretty much.
2174081	2178882	I mean, it's like they spared no expense, wasted nothing.
2179763	2183364	Anything that could have gone into the game to make it feel like
2184492	2187854	The experience of being on stage and playing a guitar, they've gone out of their way to do.
2188494	2192857	On top of that, you actually, in your career mode, you have a selectable character list.
2194078	2204444	One of the characters is based off of Keith Richards, but when I first saw this character, me being the Gorillaz fan I am, he was playing a flying V. I was like, did they put Murdoch in this game?
2204784	2210007	Because I was like, excuse me, but no, it was actually based off of Keith Richards directly, so I thought it was funny.
2210487	2211288	I had a nerd moment.
2211748	2212168	That's cool.
2213369	2213589	But,
2214145	2216006	There's Megadeth in that game.
2216407	2218268	Symphony of Destruction is in that game.
2218808	2220229	What were some of the other songs you guys can remember?
2220249	2221490	There's some Stevie Ray Vaughan.
2223852	2224712	Who else do you remember?
2225253	2225713	What did you play?
2226293	2227654	I played Smoke on the Water.
2229055	2229355	Okay.
2229435	2230256	Because that was awesome.
2230336	2231677	I also played Iron Man.
2233078	2235900	And I think it was like Turn It Up or whatever.
2235920	2238021	Whatever that stupid song is that's in the PSP commercial.
2238041	2239322	Franz Ferdinand's song.
2239422	2240443	Yeah, Franz Ferdinand.
2241437	2241897	I played that.
2242057	2248739	I checked out some of the unlocked songs because there is apparently a way to keep pressed to unlock all the songs because we watched them do it.
2248899	2249679	Yeah.
2249779	2251099	So, yeah.
2251419	2257821	Anyways, they had some of the original songs like Guitar Hero, of course, was one that they came up with.
2257881	2261802	And then I was looking for, apparently there's a Freeze Pop song in there, but I didn't see it.
2262382	2264062	Well, of course, there's got to be a Freeze Pop song.
2264082	2266203	Oh, another song that's in that is Ziggy Stardust.
2266743	2267463	Oh, cool.
2267723	2268123	That's cool.
2270084	2270444	But, um.
2270744	2271024	All right.
2271550	2274851	Yeah, the controller, it's just like a normal controller.
2275932	2276612	Buttons were sticking.
2277693	2281975	I had a little bit of a button sticking problem, but it wasn't bad.
2282635	2285996	It was really, you know, it's upstuck, fixed, done.
2286176	2286497	Who cares?
2288077	2288738	It's pretty cool, though.
2289258	2290338	Really easy to get into.
2290798	2298662	The whammy bar thing, though, kind of throws you off when you're trying to do that, because you're supposed to hold the note down for so long and then do the whammy bar thing, and it takes a while to get used to it.
2299302	2300963	But it looks pretty good.
2303339	2304879	I can see the potential for some lawsuits.
2305380	2320224	The game is a little similar to other games, but... The differences, I think, are substantial enough that they can't... The controller is so completely... You can't do a guitar controller without having it be similar.
2320584	2327266	However, after a little bit of interviewing, the controllers are actually completely built from the ground up.
2327286	2330187	The switch is built on a different mechanism than the Guitar Freaks controller.
2330247	2331407	I'm not talking about Guitar Freaks.
2332368	2333108	I'm talking about another game.
2334219	2336741	I'm saying this game's too much like Karaoke Revolution.
2337041	2339002	The interface and everything's too similar.
2339022	2341384	But Harmonix co-made it, so who cares?
2341404	2342104	Oh, I guess that's fine then.
2343045	2344926	They own the patent, so... Yeah, Harmonix.
2344946	2348087	And on top of that, it doesn't flow side to side, it flows forward.
2348668	2349108	Yeah, whatever.
2349488	2351229	It's an okay game.
2351449	2357713	Harmonix developed and Konami published Karaoke Revolution, and this time Red Octane is publishing Guitar Hero.
2357733	2362036	Well, it's a step in the right direction for Red Octane actually getting real companies to develop games for them.
2362376	2362616	You know...
2364046	2367687	So I think that's great, but I don't know.
2367867	2368167	It's good.
2368267	2374429	I'm looking forward to it, since we're not going to get Guitar Freaks until at least next fall.
2375109	2375529	At least.
2375669	2377110	Probably never, but yeah, at least.
2377370	2380150	This game is going to completely blow Guitar Freaks out of the water.
2380370	2380791	I'm sorry.
2381071	2389913	Yeah, it sounds interesting, because if Guitar Freaks now comes out later this time, they're going to... If it's happening, we don't know, but we can speculate that since...
2390393	2397797	Guitar Freaks V is coming out overseas that maybe now is the time for it here if it's going to come out.
2397837	2405781	I'm awfully surprised that they didn't jump with that first instead of Beatmania because I think Guitar Freaks is pretty easy to market to people instead of Beatmania whereas, you know...
2406161	2409282	DJ Simulator playing a guitar, okay, that makes more sense.
2409302	2412324	But they're also coming from the import fanbase, I think.
2412424	2414084	And how was DDR really successful?
2414104	2433552	A lot of it was word of mouth, and Beatmania has a really rabid fanbase established, although I think that rabid fanbase is going to turn a little bit on a US version, just because you've seen what's happened with DDR, and people bitch because, you know, it's not as good as the Japanese versions, and I have this bad feeling the same thing's going to happen here.
2433976	2435577	although we don't know yet because we haven't seen enough of the game.
2435597	2438739	The other thing that's... But, sorry, sorry, I just want to finish my thought here.
2439959	2442161	Guitar Freaks does not have that same fan base.
2442201	2450465	I mean, granted, there are loyal Guitar Freaks players out there, but you don't exactly see GuitarFreak.com or things like that, you know what I mean?
2450506	2461832	Like, there's a very established Beatmania base on, like, Bomani style, very established DDR base on DDR Freak, but no real solid Guitar Freak base, if you know what I mean.
2462406	2468010	Anyways, one thing to mention though is all the songs are full length, so that is something kind of cool.
2468550	2476095	Although I was kind of wishing that there would be some short versions too, kind of like how Karaoke Revolution doesn't have the option of playing a shorter or longer version of the song.
2476536	2478797	Would have been nice, but still really cool.
2480158	2480318	Yeah.
2481019	2488524	Now the other thing though, this other story that they're doing about In The Groove though, I couldn't help but think that this story's been done before.
2488544	2489044	I mean...
2489505	2492586	The whole, like, oh, people using the game to lose weight.
2492986	2494026	I mean, come on.
2494507	2495647	It's been done with DDR.
2495667	2497888	It's just another freaking game ripping off on DDR.
2498068	2499768	Of course people are going to lose weight because they're moving around.
2500288	2502109	It's just the same story all over again, though.
2502529	2504110	I didn't really see why they were covering that.
2504610	2506470	But they didn't talk to you guys about that story at all.
2506490	2506931	No, they didn't.
2506971	2507351	They didn't.
2507491	2508991	But they're talking to other people in the community.
2509031	2510472	But still, it's the same thing.
2510532	2513293	It's like, you know, I don't know.
2513313	2517374	It'd be like, you know, doing a story about, like, oh, teen, you know, people are...
2517827	2518267	Thank you for watching!
2537981	2541144	What else will the media say about DarkSakura?
2560382	2560882	Video games.
2561262	2562483	Now we're going to get this one.
2562563	2566564	Orange Dogs Radio was saying that video games don't cause violence.
2566684	2567864	You know what causes violence?
2568104	2568965	People cause violence.
2569045	2570745	Sucked up people cause violence.
2571305	2572246	I cause violence.
2574186	2575507	Guns don't kill people.
2576087	2576587	I do.
2578067	2578447	Nah.
2578467	2579368	I don't know.
2579448	2580268	It looks like a good game.
2580588	2581848	I'm really looking forward to it.
2581868	2583329	It's supposed to be coming out, I guess, in November.
2584249	2584769	Guitar Hero?
2584969	2585169	Yeah.
2585790	2586530	So it'll be good.
2586550	2586590	Um.
2590034	2590694	I want to play it.
2590754	2593216	I'm pissed I didn't get to go and be a media whore like you two.
2593816	2596158	I got a lot of footage of me playing the game.
2596398	2597779	I did, however, slip.
2598459	2599640	Did you say it's so fun?
2599860	2604483	I didn't say it's so much fun, but I said it's so fun.
2604663	2606264	So that's almost as bad.
2607064	2608285	And I know what you're hoping.
2608405	2609025	Dear God.
2610586	2611247	Dear God.
2611267	2615489	Whatever those YM fucking whatever they are called.
2615589	2616250	I'm praying here.
2616930	2618171	Dear God who art in heaven.
2620083	2623746	Please, I've been a good boy this year, and I go to church every Sunday.
2623766	2628290	Well, okay, even if that church is called Burger King, who cares?
2629831	2631393	I praise God in my own special way.
2631613	2632614	God, don't listen to him.
2632794	2633995	Shh, shh, I'm praying.
2635256	2647106	God, if you're listening right now, I really, really, really, really, really want KCRA to use the clip of Loki going, this is so fun, and nothing else.
2648891	2650993	God, please show lots of Jamie in the story.
2651053	2656097	Show lots and lots of Jamie, but please only show Loki saying it's oh so much fun or whatever the hell he said.
2657198	2657839	I appreciate it.
2657959	2659140	Love and amen.
2659300	2659520	Rob.
2660441	2661202	Jesus Christ.
2665145	2666306	I even caught myself right after.
2666326	2667247	I'm like, ah, shit.
2667967	2668228	Yeah.
2672031	2672511	I can't wait.
2674293	2675474	I'm going to have my TiVo ready.
2678891	2680572	I know I'm going to watch it and be disappointed again.
2682592	2683592	Just going to be disappointed.
2684313	2684613	All right.
2684893	2685733	We'll see what happens.
2686633	2687814	At least you guys get to be on TV.
2687834	2688494	I'm not even there.
2688774	2690574	I'm just going to pretend to be bitter about it for a while.
2691115	2691595	No, that's cool.
2692175	2694536	That's cool.
2694656	2695996	I probably won't even be in it.
2696116	2697376	I'll just be playing the guitar.
2697396	2698777	Or you'll see your feet or your hands.
2699497	2701818	Because your feet were in the paper, so why not have your hands on TV?
2701838	2702438	That would be pretty cool.
2702458	2703558	Yeah, I think the hands might work.
2703958	2704238	All right.
2704598	2706339	Or I'll be doing something retarded.
2707253	2713656	Because I was trying to over-exaggerate the movements that you would play during the game in hopes of more TV time.
2714156	2724422	So we're going to see this clip of Loki during the whammy bar, like he's going to drop to his knees and go, I should have done that.
2724562	2724982	Shit!
2725662	2726302	I wasn't thinking.
2726322	2727243	See, I didn't prepare.
2728121	2734842	It's going to be like that scene in Risky Business where Loki just comes out in a t-shirt and his undies and slides across the floor playing the guitar.
2734862	2736223	That's what we're going to see on the news.
2736523	2748565	I remember one time Dan bringing out my DDR pad on Dreamcast because it was just sitting there and grabbing one of the Guitar Freaks guitars and then rolling around on the floor being a freak, wailing hard.
2750045	2753566	So he decided that they needed a new game using the itoy called Air Guitar Freaks.
2755205	2755545	Have it.
2755745	2756026	Why not?
2756066	2757907	They can do Samba de Amigo with the iToy.
2757927	2759668	They have a guitar game in iToy Play 3.
2759708	2759949	What?
2759969	2761590	Yeah, air guitar.
2761710	2762651	There's an iToy Play 3?
2763311	2763551	Yes.
2763771	2764832	I didn't know that.
2764852	2765633	No one buys them!
2765833	2766874	iToy Play 1 sucks!
2766934	2771317	Okay, they have iToy Play 1, iToy Play 2, iToy Play 3, and Spy Toy.
2771818	2772958	They also have iToy Chat.
2772998	2773659	Spy Toy?
2773819	2775300	Spy Toy.
2775520	2778202	Does that mean you can use it to spy on your neighbors who have iToys in their house?
2778222	2783006	No, you can use it as a surveillance system, and you can also play spy-themed games.
2783464	2786905	Let me tell you, there's a lot of iToy games out there that you never hear about because they suck.
2787485	2788446	All of them suck.
2788506	2797469	I want to get iToy chat and then just sit on the couch naked and see what happens.
2797729	2798389	Is that wrong?
2800110	2801110	Do you need to pray again?
2802170	2802551	No, I don't.
2802851	2806312	Dear God, please don't let this haven go to hell.
2806332	2807932	Okay, stop stealing my bit.
2809513	2812334	I just want to get iToy chat and then just join the room and...
2813172	2814614	Hey guys, what's up?
2815354	2816816	I'm just letting it all hang out tonight.
2817376	2818077	What are you guys up to?
2818778	2820239	Do they moderate on iToyChat?
2820780	2821861	They can't moderate that, can they?
2822401	2827967	You can do it, I think, up to 15 people per room or whatever, and you can...
2828854	2831696	Chat via video and voice.
2831796	2834699	I think you can do up to 100 people via text chat.
2834719	2836180	Do they have adult-rated rooms, though?
2836220	2838361	Because, like, you know, look at Yahoo.
2838602	2840403	Like the Yahoo Messenger program.
2840443	2846908	You can do webcams on Yahoo, but the only thing I know that people use that Yahoo cam thing for is for sex.
2848469	2849670	Or web sex, whatever they call it.
2849690	2851191	Cam sex, whatever the hell they call it.
2851472	2852372	I'm not into cam sex.
2852392	2854374	I'm not going to knock cam sex for those of you that are into it.
2854394	2855795	Here's the really crappy stuff you can do.
2855835	2856936	You can actually play games.
2857389	2859130	Like they have, you know, chess.
2859230	2860471	Maybe you can do strip chess.
2860631	2861432	Spank the monkey.
2861792	2863833	You know, strip battleship.
2863853	2866435	Wait, you can play chess using your hands and stuff?
2866735	2867676	You can play chess.
2867796	2869597	Or any appendage that you can play.
2869617	2873279	You can play battleship or naval war is what they call it.
2875160	2876841	Ow, you sunk my battleship!
2878763	2879943	Oh baby, sink it.
2880904	2886548	But anyways, um, no, they've got, um, a lot of weird games in this thing.
2886568	2886608	Um,
2887620	2890322	It says you can do... What the hell?
2890962	2892403	I think you can just make your own rooms.
2892423	2893284	Can you make your own porn?
2894344	2897066	Um, you can... That would sell some eye toys.
2897166	2900508	You can turn into a video phone, so... I guess.
2900528	2902069	Did you know that there'd be underage porn?
2902089	2908593	Because all the, like, 16 to 17 year olds that have eye toys are gonna, you know, run around naked on it, and then that's just wrong.
2908773	2914117	You know, we can't have that, you know, so... Um... Yeah, I don't know.
2914777	2915938	I don't know about that, but, um...
2916291	2917191	Yeah, Itoy Chat 3.
2918192	2924014	In fact, if I remember correctly, I think that came out last month.
2925935	2935618	I just... I know that these games sucked, so... I played Itoy Play 2 at E3, and I was thoroughly unimpressed.
2936939	2939140	Oh, maybe Itoy Play 3 hasn't come out yet.
2939300	2943141	I was more impressed with the Harry Potter Itoy game than I was with Itoy Play 2.
2944321	2945722	And even though Harry Potter...
2946178	2947339	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2967566	2971589	But the way the balloons are positioned... They look like big penises.
2971649	2973130	It looks like you're blowing up a boner.
2973690	2977513	And this one woman on the end with her yellow balloon, she's all into it.
2977533	2982356	She's like, oh, I got a big balloon.
2983477	2984017	I don't know.
2984037	2984537	What the hell?
2984557	2985358	That's great.
2986539	2987919	Please check that out in chat.
2988820	2991001	Yeah, it's really bad.
2991041	2992763	They have another one called Call Kitty.
2995324	2996305	I guess, I don't know.
2997433	2998634	And this looks really weird.
2998654	3007240	I don't know what the hell this game... No one should play itoy games ever.
3007981	3010923	I mean, I don't think anyone should actually buy the itoy.
3010943	3015386	I talked about doing this a while back, you know, I have a ton of itoy games.
3015527	3019569	We should just really do a review of all the itoy games out there, because it'll take like five minutes.
3019630	3020910	I mean, really, there's not that much.
3021091	3022792	I've only played itoy Groove.
3023544	3024264	and iToyPlay.
3024364	3031727	iToy Groove is an interesting concept but it's executed not that well because I can't like play it for shit.
3032607	3034307	Oh my god, please post that in chat.
3035588	3037748	There's grandma playing an air guitar game.
3037788	3038529	That's great.
3038589	3039809	I need to make an icon of that.
3040069	3041309	Oh my god, please do.
3042010	3042270	Okay.
3042450	3045211	That needs to be like our new like Orange Lounge logo thing.
3046031	3048572	Can we make a background for ORPSP.com?
3050012	3050692	I suppose.
3051332	3051753	We'll see.
3052053	3052953	Oh my god, that's great.
3052993	3053273	All right.
3053806	3056548	Anyway, enough picture chat because it doesn't make for very good radio.
3056969	3058350	We're going to take a break, I think, kids.
3058570	3059351	And we're going to come back.
3059391	3062974	And Extrofer wants to chat for a little bit because Extrofer has some news he wants to share with you guys.
3064246	3064866	Yes, I do.
3092967	3093428	I don't know.
3093448	3095091	We'll hear from them when they call in after this.
3095111	3097735	So we're going to get to Sky Blind after this.
3097896	3099879	And in this break, we're going to do some Guitar Freaks music.
3099899	3100821	We'll be back after this.

3519026	3519906	What the hell happened there?
3519986	3520327	My bad.
3520667	3521648	Well, we'll just come back cold.
3521688	3523489	Hi, we're back on Orange Lounge Radio.

3593058	3593778	Okay.
3594498	3596498	And I'm hoping that it'll be 7 to 9.
3597058	3597378	Okay.
3598259	3603000	I will talk about video games for all of you that are into that sort of thing.
3603040	3603380	I don't know.
3604400	3607500	And there's plenty of other hours talking about Captain Tightpants.
3608161	3610221	I will talk about Captain Tightpants.
3611122	3618865	Um, it's, it's for all of the, you know, Orange Lawn's radio is filled with straight guys, so I feel like, hey, I'll be the queer voice for the straight guys here.
3619425	3620466	Um, hello?
3620926	3622947	Oh, no, no, no, like, I'm not a guy.
3623227	3627149	No, straight, straight people, sorry, PC, straight people.
3627429	3633111	Oh, wait, so you, so you, basically, Extraverse Case of the Monday is like, it's, it's queer, queer eye for the gamer guy?
3633451	3637433	For people who don't enjoy the, Queer voice for the gay, gay, never mind.
3638533	3639373	What, what were you saying?
3639393	3640514	Queer ear for the,
3641149	3642270	Straight... Dears?
3643370	3645491	Queer voice for the straight guy's ear.
3645911	3646511	That's what I said.
3646591	3646971	Okay.
3647011	3647372	Well, no.
3647872	3649853	Queer cock for the straight guy's ass.
3650113	3655335	No, I'm going to... You know, it's not like... You guys can hear a gay guy talk.
3655375	3657736	It's not like I'm going to be in your house.
3657776	3660697	You don't have to fear that I'm going to fuck you up the ass.
3660877	3662558	Because I do that.
3662718	3665819	I fucked Loki like three times during the show tonight.
3666660	3669401	So you guys are going to all have a good time.
3670575	3677120	On Mondays, hopefully, I hope for everybody to listen in, and I'll have special guests and everything.
3677140	3677580	It'll be fun.
3678521	3679402	Okay, sounds like fun.
3679722	3679942	Yay.
3679982	3681503	So it's going to be a week from Monday.
3681743	3682664	A week from Monday.
3682764	3683385	All right, sounds good.
3683745	3686107	And if you like the title, let me know.
3686147	3688769	If you don't, let me know also.
3688789	3689389	It's a work in progress.
3689409	3690510	If you don't like it, forget it.
3691130	3691511	Okay.
3692551	3694253	Your title is fabulous.
3694353	3694653	Yay.
3694973	3699777	And you can email me if you have any suggestions on what you want me to talk about as well, my email address.
3700735	3702516	is Volumetext.
3702996	3704016	We'll get you an orange launch one.
3704296	3704536	Okay.
3705036	3708277	Well, right now, I mean, you can still email me at my other address.
3708317	3710118	It's Volumetext at gmail.com.
3711798	3716059	That's how it spells out, so if they go ahead and send it to the podcast email, I'll forward it.
3716460	3718600	Just say, to Xtifer.
3718900	3722141	And now you're going to also be doing a lot of Buffy and Serenity talk, I'm sure.
3722461	3727763	I'm sure I will, you know, and I will talk about other things as well.
3728563	3728743	Right.
3730174	3740388	Now, also coming up a week from Wednesday, if I play my cards right, I will be coming back with a solo show, the launch date, a week from Wednesday.
3740408	3745696	I know I've been talking about doing a solo show for a long, long time now, but it will actually happen, for sure.
3746192	3747773	I'll be coming back a week from Wednesday.
3747793	3749074	That's Captain Tightpants?
3749615	3750456	No, not Captain Tightpants.
3750516	3754259	I do not have a name for the show yet, so until I get a better name, it's just going to be the Rob Roberts Show.
3754739	3758702	And a little thing, I'm actually doing mine every other week because of school constraints.
3759283	3767650	When I'm out of, when the semester's over, I will be going back to... Regular, every week.
3767710	3768190	Regular.
3768611	3770512	Just for the next nine weeks, every other week.
3770772	3771053	Alright.
3771613	3771993	Sounds good.
3773294	3775116	Maybe you should call your show the Rod Roddy Show.
3775762	3778412	No, because he died and that's sad.
3781804	3782025	Anyway.
3783561	3784302	So that's going to be coming back.
3784322	3786203	And I will not talk about such gay things.
3786283	3789684	I mean, I realize I'm gay, but I have other things to talk about other than, you know, who I'm fucking.
3790165	3794327	So I'm going to talk about tech stuff and geeky news.
3794607	3798949	And yes, some video games, but I'm going to kind of go outside the realm and talk about cool things on the interweb.
3799369	3800550	And just whatever I want.
3800930	3803011	It's going to be my thing to just do whatever I want.
3803411	3808534	And for those of you guys that miss Vanilla Sky and Outside the Box, unfortunately, you know, I haven't gotten...
3809034	3813040	The folks that were on that show to commit to come back, and I think we're going to have scheduling problems.
3813100	3815903	But hopefully once in a while they'll drop in or something as time goes on.
3816244	3818547	But for now, this is just going to be my solo thingy.
3819548	3820890	But I'll try to have guests as well.
3821270	3822332	So we'll be working on that.
3826698	3830880	We're going to have live shows Monday, every other Tuesday, and Wednesday.
3831260	3833381	It's only every other Tuesday for a little while, so not that long.
3833861	3838364	Also, to make up, though, for my missing Tuesday nights, I plan on occasionally doing fuck-off shows.
3838944	3841725	That means you have to be listening late at the night.
3841985	3842385	That's right.
3842506	3843186	So it'll be a good time.
3844366	3844647	All right.
3845327	3847408	So lots of live stuff coming back to Orange House Radio soon.
3847928	3848528	That should be fun.
3848768	3849729	And Loki, still no show.
3850290	3850911	Don't look at me.
3851031	3851971	I'm not... I know.
3851991	3856555	I've got a fiancé that doesn't allow the... We need to give her a show.
3856976	3860378	I need to freaking play more Final Fantasy XI is what I need to do.
3860398	3864702	Let's have... Let's get Nelly to fill in for the weeks that DarkSakura's not here.
3865223	3867685	I want you and Nelly to be guests on my show.
3869066	3869806	That'd be cool.
3870807	3871828	I'll be on your show.
3872268	3873970	I'm going to have everybody on my show.
3875051	3877213	And... Yeah.
3877453	3877713	All right.
3879161	3883144	We can have a Brazilian wax job show where we all wax each other.
3883964	3885865	Like, ooh, that looks so good.
3887046	3888027	That's okay.
3888687	3889068	Anyway.
3889568	3890649	Okay, bad idea.
3891369	3892950	So I want to talk about something now.
3894331	3895792	Your last wax job.
3895872	3897453	No, no, it's not sex related.
3898754	3900575	They're not necessarily sexual.
3900975	3902076	I did something today.
3903857	3904037	Uh-oh.
3904578	3905758	Do you need to be tanked?
3906639	3906899	What?
3906919	3908060	Do you need to be tanked?
3908616	3908976	Maybe.
3910716	3914717	It's kind of one of those things that I said I was never going to do.
3915137	3917138	Just get it out, man.
3917438	3918578	You have one life.
3919498	3919818	Live it.
3920678	3928479	But, I don't know, something happened and it's like, you know, I decided maybe I was being just a little too harsh and I needed to open up my mind a little bit.
3929640	3932520	And your... And your ass.
3932940	3933540	And my butt.
3935421	3935721	So...
3937904	3941145	I went and I picked up World of Warcraft today.
3945406	3948087	Let's hope that Miklatov is not listening right now.
3948107	3949488	Oh, I already told him he's pissed.
3949588	3950408	He's pissed.
3950848	3951188	Oh, really?
3951308	3952589	He's pissed at me.
3956410	3956690	So...
3957748	3962630	I bought World of Warcraft, and I actually already had a chance to play it a little bit before the show.
3962830	3966852	I'm on a server called Doomhammer, but I do plan to make a character on Scarlet Crusade as well.
3966972	3967572	Bronzebeard, too.
3967592	3968793	Because I know that's where all you guys are at.
3968813	3969813	Play Horde on Bronzebeard.
3971054	3977397	Well, I'm only going to limit myself to three characters, because I have so many friends that play, I need to... I have two.
3977537	3979598	So, I'm going to have one on Scarlet Crusade for you guys.
3979618	3979938	Alliance.
3980738	3981639	Alliance on Scarlet Crusade.
3981659	3982479	Play a Night Elf.
3982981	3984362	I will be near where you'll go.
3984422	3985102	We'll see, we'll see.
3985543	3990266	And then also, I will be on wherever the gay one is.
3990326	3991427	I think it's P something.
3991527	3992948	I want to play on the gay server.
3994088	3996390	So, well then I'll let you know which one that is.
3996570	3996810	Okay.
3997030	3998411	So, that's it.
3998511	3999092	I'm on World of Warcraft.
3999112	3999812	I've already played it.
3999892	4001373	I played it a little bit before tonight's show.
4001413	4002894	Isn't it so much better?
4003695	4004655	No, it's just different.
4005116	4008118	You can actually... I'm not going to say it's better because it's different.
4008718	4010039	It actually reminded me a lot of Guild Wars.
4011338	4015622	I know that World of Warcraft came first, but it plays a lot like Guild Wars.
4016342	4017343	A lot, a lot like Guild Wars.
4017363	4019325	Why are you shaking your head disapprovingly, Loki?
4020866	4024189	Just, you know, going to another game that you won't play.
4024569	4025009	Whatever.
4025630	4027251	I'm sticking with one game that I won't play.
4027271	4028892	Good job.
4029713	4030994	No, I'm not leaving Final Fantasy XI.
4031014	4033236	I'm not by any means canceling my account on Final Fantasy XI.
4033616	4040582	I just... I got to this point where I was like, I'm bored, and I don't want to be bored, and...
4041440	4053852	I feel like I don't have enough time to invest in the game, and I'm never going to be able to participate in the way the game is set up in a lot of the end game events because I have no time to play.
4054493	4058216	So I just wanted to find another game to fill casually my time.
4058236	4062741	But I do have a lot of friends that still play Final Fantasy XI, and I do plan on doing some things in it, just very limited.
4063482	4065323	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4090768	4090968	Yeah.
4091248	4092208	So that was my big secret.
4092449	4093309	I finally caved.
4093409	4095429	Bah, bah, bah.
4095510	4096210	And I bought World of Warcraft.
4096230	4096570	That's alright.
4096610	4098690	You'll just switch to the next big thing when World of Warcraft comes out.
4098711	4099191	That's right.
4099251	4100111	I probably will.
4100811	4104672	I'll stick with Final Fantasy XI since I don't even know what's going on now.
4105153	4110594	And they've added another update and they're doing the launch of that Treasures of whatever the hell it's called.
4110794	4112555	It's going to be coming out again with more.
4112575	4113455	I do want to check that out.
4113715	4114695	With more player classes.
4114796	4115676	I'm hoping that for...
4119921	4121121	I know it's probably not going to happen.
4121141	4126643	I'm hoping that the Xbox 360 version is on the same servers, because then that could just, you know... It will be.
4127444	4135026	Well, I'm not sure about that, because it might be on Xbox or Microsoft servers, in which case, you know, then you won't be able to play with other people.
4135506	4142469	If it is, then I can cancel my PlayOnline account and just play for my Xbox Live, and that'll kind of cut down on costs a bit.
4142809	4145470	Plus, I'll be able to, you know, have the game looking better.
4146550	4149171	We need Katamari, the NMO RPG.
4149966	4151688	I need to roll over the king.
4151708	4156472	There's one thing I want to add about World of Warcraft is I like how you can...
4167096	4170438	You have to set up a macro for it.
4170478	4176560	I like that you don't have to play with people if you don't want to, and you don't have to be the party bitch like I used to be.
4188041	4188902	I know, they're different.
4188922	4190103	I'm not going to compare the games.
4190123	4191203	I like playing as Druid.
4191223	4191924	They're different.
4191944	4193165	Because I can kick their ass.
4193265	4199250	I like chatting with people in chat rooms, but only to myself, because talking with other people online is awful.
4200751	4200951	No.
4201411	4206175	There's a difference between talking to other people and then having to actually play with strangers.
4206195	4207276	It's still interacting.
4208016	4209077	Still the same argument.
4209117	4210458	Do these strangers have candy?
4210878	4211499	Because I like candy.
4211519	4212259	Rob, I'm going to kick your ass.
4212279	4212940	Speaking of which, Rob...
4213237	4215258	Xtifer, will you tell Shane to stop hating me?
4215278	4215938	He's mad at me.
4215978	4216578	Is he listening?
4233724	4259624	Shane, he's impulsive you know you were encouraging me you were cheering me on yeah, get it, get it, so I can use your buddy pass well yeah, I was unapologetically saying that but it's like, I'm impulsive too and I'm not gonna probably play I'm gonna probably play your buddy pass but I mean, that's gonna be limited
4260856	4263498	I'm having a fun time with Final Fantasy XI right now.
4263638	4265159	I'm, like, really enjoying it.
4265239	4266700	And I'm still a white mage.
4266780	4268621	I mean, that's the weird part about it.
4269241	4272043	Is, like, I've actually enjoyed... And you're the party bitch too, right?
4272063	4273424	Yes, yes, I've been the party bitch.
4273464	4278267	But, like, it's been actually okay, because I've been learning the skill of it all.
4279968	4280788	I'm 15 right now.
4281309	4284270	So, I mean, I'm kind of working at it, but it's going well.
4286872	4289814	I got tired of being the party bitch, so I just let the ingrates die.
4291801	4294582	I have the instant, you know, bad party remedy.
4294602	4299182	It's wonderful having the cable modem right on my desk, because I can just... Look at that!
4299362	4300383	My connection went down!
4319048	4319949	I wonder how that happened.
4320109	4321751	Oh, the cord fell out.
4322251	4323432	Oh, damn it.
4324313	4324634	Oh, well.
4325995	4328137	I guess I won't log back in.
4328658	4329479	Damn internet.
4329959	4333903	I'll never figure out how to put this cord back in until at least a couple days from now.
4335164	4335344	No.
4336105	4336385	All right.
4336906	4337487	We're going to go to...
4338410	4339350	The Skype line, guys.
4340250	4341411	OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
4341431	4344252	Click on Interact With Us if you want to call us on the Skype line.
4345152	4345912	You can check us out.
4346012	4347132	Username is Orange Lounge Radio.
4347152	4354974	But please, please, please, before you call us, if you've never talked to us before, make sure you call a username on Skype.
4355054	4358275	It's Echo123 is the username on Skype.
4358615	4361496	Make sure that you call Echo123 first before you call us.
4362756	4364917	That way you can see if you can hear yourself or not.
4365921	4367483	And I don't think you have to add this person to your buddy list.
4367863	4368584	You just call them.
4368964	4369384	Straight up.
4369564	4369785	Echo123.
4369845	4372206	And that's that.
4373848	4377231	Oh, random aside, Sakurina reminded me of something here.
4377271	4380914	Beatmania2DX is actually in the World of Warcraft credits.
4382455	4384196	In the special thanks section or something.
4384937	4388540	Like, they credit the game with, I guess, passing the time while they were coding the game.
4388560	4388960	I don't know.
4389260	4389901	And you know what?
4390421	4395005	Echo123 is the perfect person to talk to if you don't like interacting with other people and MMOs.
4399639	4400260	Let's take a call.
4400660	4401521	You're on Orange Launch Radio.
4402902	4404203	It's Legend of Zaku here.
4404403	4406946	Hello, Legend of Zaku, our serial caller.
4406986	4408968	How are you?
4409008	4411550	Yes, you probably already know where I've been this weekend.
4411610	4413131	Yes, you went to Digital Life, yes?
4414433	4420178	Yes, and I have so much, and I have some pretty, you know, I got a lot of good shit that I have to say right now.
4420198	4421619	Tell us, tell us.
4422120	4423301	The DDR tournament there.
4424389	4425930	Got coverage.
4426190	4427211	It got shitloads of coverage.
4427611	4428411	Like what kind of coverage?
4429332	4435656	MTV was filming there, you know, yesterday for a better part of the Freestyle Division.
4436756	4437837	And you wouldn't believe this.
4439018	4445601	NBC ended up filming a sitcom, part of an episode of the sitcom, in the center stage after Freestyle.
4445902	4446302	What?
4446562	4447142	What sitcom?
4447182	4447522	Do you know?
4447623	4447883	Yes.
4448463	4453266	I don't know, but it was just two white guys just dancing right there on a fifth mix.
4454359	4458642	The Drip Machine, Climax Basic Like My Name Is Earl or something?
4459723	4464667	I don't know, just two white guys dancing, yeah, doing like You Got Served thing on a DDR pad.
4465167	4467549	And they, yeah, they pretty much shot that scene there.
4467729	4468369	Should be interesting.
4468429	4469450	Were they both flamey?
4470811	4472632	No, DDR's already been on Will & Grace.
4472952	4473333	Oh, it has?
4473433	4473613	Yes.
4473953	4474053	Oh.
4474093	4481819	Yeah, but... Okay, I also might have to snag a few things from the Red Octane booth, which was right next to the tournament area.
4481839	4481919	Okay.
4482580	4484862	Behold the link that I'm posting up right now.
4486623	4488044	You wouldn't believe who I managed to meet.
4488244	4489806	Kyle Ward from In The Groove.
4491607	4491967	Hello?
4492207	4496190	Yeah, I mean, I was so shocked I was speechless, Zaku.
4497131	4497812	Oh, what is this?
4505457	4506658	Zaku, I fucking love you.
4506698	4508720	You just went up like 100 points in my book.
4509448	4511090	What the fuck is that?
4511490	4517816	Zaku got the person who wrote all the songs and in the groove to autograph something for us.
4523875	4527058	Zaku, I want your man babies.
4527298	4527759	Seriously.
4527779	4529580	You are awesome.
4529600	4534224	Seriously, I'm going to send it out to you sometime this week.
4534284	4535686	Just give me an address to send it to.
4536006	4537047	That is beautiful.
4537687	4540170	Also, I'm asked to play Guitar Hero this weekend.
4541991	4543973	I'm asked to play Guitar Hero this weekend.
4545777	4558548	Just one word, it's really hard for beginners to pick up, since you literally not only have to hit the button, but, you know, one of the buttons on the neck, but you also have to hit, you know, the little tab right there with the screw head that makes up the strings.
4558708	4564313	Exactly, I can't contain myself, we're all looking at the pictures and I'm giggling and I can't stop laughing, this is the coolest thing ever.
4568966	4585474	but it's not as cool as what you know but it's basically not as cool as this uh oh they had in the group two on a slim ps they had in the group two running on a ps2 okay after burn with red octane after burners that's cool okay so they so how how was that
4587202	4588282	Well, it's just the same thing.
4588322	4592624	I know Kyle Ward didn't want to say that much about when it was going to be released.
4592684	4596365	All I know is that I saw In The Groove 2 running on a PS2.
4596505	4597685	Okay.
4597925	4599505	And I got to play it on Afterburners.
4600006	4603907	To be honest, though, In The Groove 2 coming out on PS2 is kind of a duh.
4604047	4606807	I mean, we know it's going to happen at some point, but... Loki?
4607308	4614009	Well, the thing, though... That and they also had DDR Mario Mix, right, you know, playable over there.
4614049	4614870	Hold on, Loki has a thought.
4614910	4615390	It was a pretty...
4616271	4619997	There's a pretty long line trying to get through there.
4620157	4625645	If it's ran off a slim PS2, then that means it's not a beta kit, so that means it's probably done.
4626980	4628141	Yeah, it's probably a build.
4628381	4630982	I had all the songs in it, though.
4631943	4632463	Interesting.
4632483	4632984	Yeah, I had it.
4634725	4636185	Okay, okay.
4637486	4639868	How was DDR with Mario?
4639908	4640068	Huh?
4640388	4641308	How was DDR with Mario?
4642029	4647252	I did get a chance to play it, but I saw folks, you know, because the lines were pretty vague for that, and I didn't have enough time.
4648342	4655749	But, you know, it looks like a regular DDR mix, except, you know, obviously it's a license.
4656169	4658732	Yeah, and way easier.
4659673	4661875	From what I hear, there's no mods on it.
4662395	4664517	You can't even pick speed mods on that mix.
4664677	4665278	Oh, I didn't know that.
4666975	4668437	Yeah, that's what I heard.
4668457	4673903	I don't know if it's true, and the only way to find out is by getting it.
4673983	4675464	Let me see, what else can I say?
4675965	4681251	Xbox 360, obviously, yeah, they did have some on display.
4681992	4687317	It wasn't that much free shit to go around over there as well, but I did manage to get an In The Group 2 t-shirt.
4689780	4692083	Um, and yeah, and that's it.
4692383	4696348	Did you do your tequila thing in the tournament?
4698390	4699071	No, I didn't.
4699371	4701634	I didn't have the time or the money.
4703817	4709722	But as I said, MTV got plenty of coverage yesterday.
4710102	4711384	They were pretty much filming there.
4712124	4718149	They were focusing on two players that I know through DDR.
4719430	4722773	And that's pretty much what I've seen.
4723613	4724774	I'm trying to remember what else.
4725655	4726596	Yeah, lots of Halo.
4727476	4728277	All right.
4728417	4730359	MTV's actually backing Guitar Hero.
4730499	4730659	Hmm.
4732317	4733378	Who is MTV?
4733818	4734098	Really?
4734979	4735479	Yep.
4735660	4737861	And like I said earlier, Gibson Guitars.
4738942	4740864	That's going to be a pretty big music game.
4740884	4741264	We'll see.
4743046	4746088	Alright, Zaku, I can't thank you enough for getting...
4747148	4749390	Call, or what is he called?
4749450	4749810	Kiel?
4749870	4750250	Call?
4750390	4750751	I don't remember.
4750791	4751351	He's called by both.
4751731	4755014	Kiel, thank you so much for getting him to autograph something saying that we rock.
4755034	4755534	It's really fair.
4755574	4756795	We were playing his music back.
4756835	4758416	That is awesome.
4758476	4759257	I'm so excited.
4759357	4761979	Just give me an address and send it to me.
4762059	4762940	I'll get it to you.
4763020	4766923	Look for a private message from me very soon, and we'll send you something from the prize vault in exchange.
4767083	4767303	Okay?
4767323	4769064	All right, man.
4769204	4769685	Have a good one.
4769725	4770285	Thank you for calling.
4770305	4771906	All right, later.
4771946	4772246	Later.
4772587	4772827	Bye.
4772847	4772907	Bye.
4775509	4776269	That's too funny.
4776709	4777810	I'm sorry, that's great.
4777950	4781430	At least it wasn't, like, addressed to, like, myself or DarkSakura.
4781490	4783931	I mean, because that wouldn't even step up in funny.
4784011	4784491	Still, though.
4784651	4785051	Still, though.
4785171	4785631	It's so cool.
4785691	4786292	That's pretty funny.
4786772	4786952	Yeah.
4787852	4789992	All right, let's go to another call.
4790793	4791753	Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
4793253	4794474	Hi, Sephiroth 1215 here.
4794634	4796254	Hello, Sephiroth 1215, what's on your mind?
4798010	4803440	I have to say that I'm pretty pissed because I went to Digital Life today and missed everything.
4803801	4804823	And missed everything?
4804883	4805404	What happened?
4806145	4807047	Did everybody leave?
4808104	4809604	No, today just sucked.
4810505	4812745	I mean, it was crowded, I couldn't play one game.
4813526	4818947	The only thing I was able to play was Guitar Hero once, and I got to play DDR with Mario.
4820828	4830191	But otherwise, you couldn't even play in the DDR machines they had there, and all the good stuff they were giving away for free over at Red Octane were gone.
4832432	4835094	Well, they'll let anybody into digital life, right?
4835334	4837656	Pretty much, you don't have to be in the industry or anything, right?
4837676	4839518	You just get to go, pay your admission fee, right?
4840498	4840719	Yeah.
4840839	4843741	So they probably got way, way more people than they were thinking?
4845742	4846063	Maybe.
4846103	4847124	It was pretty crowded today.
4848465	4848845	Interesting.
4849301	4851222	I wonder if they get more people in E3, probably.
4851562	4858886	I really wanted to go, but, you know, I was stuck here in California, unable to get some time off to come out there, or I should say fly out there.
4860187	4862208	Did you observe anything else that was cool?
4864209	4869591	I took a while to look at the finals of the DDR tournament, which was okay, but it went by really, really slow.
4870072	4875074	Because every time people went up and they got off, they had to fix the machine again.
4875794	4876075	Wow.
4876095	4877115	It just took a long time.
4878156	4878676	But, uh...
4879269	4882310	A friend of mine actually won a free DDR rental machine.
4883630	4884810	What, like won a machine?
4885730	4886691	Well, to rent.
4887271	4887371	Oh.
4887811	4892052	So, like, for his next house party, he can get a free DDR machine for the party?
4893152	4893912	Yeah, pretty much.
4893952	4895733	He wants to run a tournament for himself.
4896253	4897493	That's kind of cool, I guess.
4898053	4899193	I'd probably do something similar.
4900153	4904894	I've always wanted to get a DDR machine on the back of a truck and go driving around town having a tournament on the back of the truck.
4904914	4907135	I like that.
4909683	4910667	How long can you stand up?
4912822	4913422	I'm sorry, what?
4914643	4918344	When it came to, like, other games, though, the whole thing was just full of Xboxes.
4918564	4922966	Like, I found a few PS2s and, like, two GameCubes.
4924126	4928007	But otherwise, they were all mainly games I didn't really care too much about.
4928227	4932409	And even the old games, they had big lines for them that are even out right now.
4933449	4933769	Wow.
4933789	4938131	But the 360 preview wasn't too bad.
4938291	4938591	I mean...
4941764	4944926	They showed a lot of the most recent, I guess.
4945566	4947607	More than what you can see at E3, I don't know.
4948568	4950469	Anyways, a real quick segue here.
4951049	4961695	What you're talking about, the DDR tournament on the back of a truck, it reminded me of the Jackass sketch where they were doing roller disco in the back of a van and they were driving around like a moving man.
4962235	4964276	That was pretty funny, so I guess it could work.
4968718	4970199	I'd want to rent a DDR machine.
4970996	4971657	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4991910	4996356	I was worried I'd get one anyway, because I always just get the systems no matter what.
4996656	5001922	I don't even care too much about the Xbox, but there's always games that come out specifically for it.
5003032	5007134	You know there's going to be some DDR Ultramix 360 or something.
5007174	5011996	I think it's inevitable that we get something like that, and that'll be the must-have game of next year or the year after.
5013657	5016598	Yeah, sure.
5017319	5019700	Otherwise, they did have a lot of NES games to play.
5019760	5022881	There was Mario Kart and Animal Crossing out there.
5022981	5028304	I heard they were demoing the Wi-Fi thing a little more, because I saw some pictures on the Internet of that.
5030435	5036206	I didn't really get to play any of it because there's big lines for it, so I just went over to DDR with Mario, which actually had no line.
5038791	5040875	Surprise, surprise, no line for DDR with Mario.
5040895	5041496	What did you think of it?
5043133	5061174	It was easy, but I mean, I put on whatever I could to make it harder, and she told me to put on something where you get bomb arms on top of the screen, and you have to hit the photo bows to make sure the bomb arms don't blow up.
5061474	5061874	Mm-hmm.
5062595	5068259	Which can be a little bit harder, only because the protobots come pretty quickly, but it wasn't too bad.
5069299	5069619	Okay.
5071641	5078025	Otherwise, what I thought was interesting there is they had a setup for ParaPara on... What?
5079126	5083549	Yeah, by the DDR machines, but it was off.
5083609	5086971	All I saw was the ParaPara controllers, and it's just the ParaPara underneath.
5087031	5090253	Like for PlayStation 2 or for the arcades?
5091189	5091850	Interesting.
5091870	5092310	Okay, well.
5118959	5120680	Maybe there's... I don't know.
5120720	5123701	Maybe just some kid brought it from home to let everybody play.
5123781	5124121	I don't know.
5124161	5124662	That's weird.
5125182	5125822	That is very weird.
5126422	5127063	But it wasn't on.
5129544	5130424	Anything else you want to share with us?
5132845	5133245	Not really.
5133485	5135906	I was fairly impressed with Guitar Hero, though.
5136087	5141769	I played one of the second easiest kind of songs.
5143210	5146291	I mean, it took me a second to learn, but otherwise it wasn't too bad.
5146738	5149900	Yeah, we're getting a lot of good early feedback on that, so it should be a good game.
5149980	5151961	Did it feel like Amplitude?
5152001	5154182	Have you played Amplitude and Frequency?
5154222	5155223	Did it feel like those games to you?
5156003	5157864	Yeah, actually, it was pretty similar to that.
5158064	5162687	I mean, same way, same setup and everything.
5162967	5163347	Very cool.
5163447	5165609	It's just that with, I don't know, a guitar.
5167129	5168010	Okay, that works.
5168630	5171712	Alright, well, we're going to go ahead and let you go so we can get to some other calls, but thanks for calling in, okay?
5172495	5179416	I'm glad to hear you had a good time at the show, even though everything was very crowded and you didn't get to play too much, but at least you got to see a lot of cool stuff.
5180377	5181237	Yeah, yeah, it wasn't bad.
5181257	5181557	All right.
5181577	5181777	All right.
5182577	5183337	All right, take care.
5184157	5184438	Thank you.
5184578	5184858	Later.
5186998	5187818	Let's go to one more call.
5188658	5189479	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
5190319	5191599	Hey, hey, hey, it's Ron John.
5191799	5192619	Hi, Ron John.
5192659	5193019	How are you?
5193980	5195320	Hey, what's up, people?
5195440	5196100	Hey.
5196420	5196840	Hey.
5197160	5198020	Hey, you want to hear a joke?
5198761	5199121	Yeah, yeah.
5199221	5199421	Okay.
5199761	5200921	What do gay horses eat?
5201946	5202726	Hey!
5202886	5203707	Hey!
5204207	5204987	Hey!
5205467	5205968	Sorry, anyway.
5206848	5211830	The funny thing you've mentioned, that has something to do with the con I went to this past, last weekend.
5212130	5212550	Oh, really?
5213250	5218112	Yes, we have what was called AnnaFest, which is like a girl celebration type convention.
5218773	5220673	So, YaoiCon without the Yaoi?
5221534	5222674	Yeah.
5223494	5226456	They were actually showing American animation at the con.
5228376	5229777	Sounds like Total Shoujo Day.
5231181	5234926	There was actually a shoujo con, but that's it for another story.
5235026	5237990	But anywho, I was in charge of the masquerade.
5238451	5239372	I had no staffers.
5242236	5243958	Okay, so what did you do?
5244439	5245581	What was your responsibility?
5246402	5248805	I was in charge of the masquerade and the karaoke.
5249853	5255458	That whole weekend I got screamed at by the concert because stuff was not running properly.
5255798	5256879	I was missing stuff.
5256919	5257820	I was missing that.
5258341	5260002	I didn't even know I was missing anything.
5260182	5262644	I didn't even unpack half the stuff that we needed.
5265747	5267048	It was just crazy.
5268069	5270952	It was a Saturday, Sunday, Monday convention.
5271392	5272873	Why do you have a convention on a Monday?
5273174	5274375	Or was Monday a holiday or something?
5274715	5275576	AX goes Friday...
5276757	5277658	Oh, see, that's crazy.
5277838	5279680	Then again, AX also sucks ass.
5280420	5281241	Yeah.
5281261	5282081	As in, A sucks.
5282962	5283282	Mm-hmm.
5283803	5287385	I tried to tell them to go Friday, Saturday, Sunday, but they wouldn't want to listen to me.
5288306	5290428	I guess I haven't been to enough cons to know better.
5291649	5293270	So what was the highlight of the con?
5294391	5295231	The masquerade.
5295612	5299595	Overall, everybody said the con sucked as a whole, but they loved the masquerade.
5300255	5303277	Especially the power-power skit that was done by my friends.
5303538	5305139	They did Go Godzilla Go.
5305811	5306291	Oh, God.
5306711	5307272	What did they do?
5308392	5312634	They did the whole Power of Power, um... The whole Power of Power dance to it.
5313374	5317736	Plus, they had one of my friends, Godzilla, in the background raising their arms back and forth.
5321437	5323238	Rancha, I want to go to an anime con with you.
5324238	5325419	I'm telling you, fine.
5325679	5329080	In May 2007, I'm shooting for... I have an idea for a skit.
5330260	5330640	Uh-oh.
5331541	5334362	I want to have a bunch of people do Lodoss War cosplay.
5335169	5338891	and then do the D&D Satan's Game thing.
5340793	5343254	What's the con on the East Coast you're trying to get us to come to next year?
5344175	5344755	Katsukon.
5344935	5345355	Katsukon.
5345375	5345916	And when's that?
5346896	5348897	It's first or second weekend of February.
5348917	5350859	I have to post information about that in my journal.
5350899	5351339	Yeah, definitely.
5351359	5352760	You send me a plane ticket, I'll be there.
5353560	5356582	I may just come because I want to go to the East Coast.
5356942	5358703	Anyway, so I may take some time off to go.
5358783	5359204	So we'll see.
5359544	5360665	Definitely give me the details.
5361405	5363346	Yeah, I already put you down in my room for the suite.
5363446	5363726	Woo!
5363786	5363867	Woo!
5365747	5366328	I'll try to go.
5367269	5367729	Sweet.
5368610	5370172	And I'll try to bring the bike and costume.
5370772	5371052	Nice.
5371613	5377278	Because one of my friends, she runs like a giant Guilty Gear cosplay shoot.
5377518	5379400	She has like multiple Kai costumes.
5380141	5383204	I don't know shit about anime, which you'll find out at a convention.
5383344	5385206	I think that Rob should cosplay Faust.
5385306	5388609	But I will game geek it up with anybody.
5389773	5391034	Rob, we're going to make you a costume.
5391054	5392735	We're going to have you cosplay Faust.
5393015	5395197	I want to cosplay as a slime from Dragon Quest.
5395217	5396058	How about Benamaru?
5397178	5401041	No, I don't think... Rob doesn't have... I don't have the abs for that.
5401441	5405364	But I think that Rob would make a perfect Faust if there's a Guilty Gear cosplay group.
5406265	5412269	We should totally imitate the guys who do the same thing at AX every year and have the Shinsengumi running around.
5413890	5415311	See, on the East Coast, we don't have that.
5415351	5416852	We have T-shirt ninjas running around.
5417172	5417933	T-shirt ninjas.
5418874	5419174	Fun.
5420323	5422184	No, no, no, no, we need the Turks this year.
5422685	5429708	Well, I will definitely be planning on trying to come to that con, so any of our East Coast listeners, I want them to go too, so I can meet everybody at once.
5430409	5438874	Speaking of the Turks, CapsaCon, we're having a massive Advent Children group, and I am crying about it because I saw all the details for Barret.
5441395	5442096	And what happened?
5443917	5446098	I shit my pants after seeing that gun arm.
5446138	5449760	I'm screaming, I have to make that, I have to make that!
5451414	5451974	You know what?
5452615	5452755	What?
5452835	5453876	It's entirely possible.
5455477	5456937	Just do the metal arm.
5458358	5458979	I'm doing it.
5459059	5464762	I think I'll probably stick with the same material I made my original gun arm with, which was PVC.
5464902	5466864	For those that don't know where Katsukan is, where is it?
5466924	5468164	Because our chat room is yelling at me.
5468525	5469705	It's Washington, D.C.
5469985	5470186	Okay.
5470846	5474588	This means I have to starve myself for four months if I were to do Tifa.
5474828	5476069	I could stand to go to Washington, D.C.
5476630	5479471	It's Washington, D.C., the Omni Sherm Hotel.
5479591	5480492	I'll cosplay Marlene.
5481072	5482233	Alright, I'm saving my money right now.
5483293	5483713	Sweet.
5484013	5484233	Alright.
5484414	5491357	And back to Anna, the funniest thing about it, everybody was saying that the con was so gay, and my response was, well, what do you expect?
5491377	5492737	It was run by a bulldog dyke.
5495279	5495739	I did that.
5495759	5496919	I shit you not.
5496939	5499561	People were saying that the con was so gay, and he says, what do you expect?
5499581	5500661	It was run by a bulldog dyke.
5501321	5506244	She's running around with this long-ass mullet, and she has the Qui-Gon Jin braid, too.
5506384	5508785	I said Star Wars fans would lynch her for that.
5511647	5512747	I have to find a way there.
5512767	5513988	I will have to find a way.
5514228	5521189	All right, Ronshan, we've got to let you go because we've got more show to do, but thanks for the... I'm going to start a PayPal collection, send DarkSakura to the East Coast.
5521209	5521629	All right.
5522129	5524090	Oh, Jamie, I have a link to send you later.
5524110	5526310	It's a tour of all the Ron Nordhapp soundtracks.
5527091	5527391	Ooh!
5528051	5529151	Just email that to me.
5529791	5530311	Of course I will.
5530331	5531652	Jamie at OrangetownRadio.com.
5531772	5533012	Have fun, you anime nerds.
5533532	5533852	Okay.
5534852	5535593	You shouldn't talk.
5535793	5536073	Bye.
5536093	5536413	I know.
5536453	5536773	Bye.
5538251	5538972	I shouldn't talk.
5539312	5541133	I'm on the radio talking about video games.
5541453	5543294	But to be fair, I also talk about sex.
5544755	5545316	That's true.
5546256	5546877	Please shuffle.
5548218	5548518	All right.
5549178	5550559	Let's go to a break, kids.
5550659	5554802	We've got to go to a break because when we come back from the break, we're going to get into the cage match and some other little things.
5555542	5558004	I do want to take a couple more Skype calls if we have time.
5558024	5560746	I know there's some more people that want to get through, so I want to entertain that.
5560766	5561967	But we have our regular segments.
5562007	5563808	We definitely have to get through first.
5564426	5570848	So we're going to go to a break, and in this break, I figure we'll start it off with... How about something from EX2?
5570888	5573590	We haven't played some EX2 stuff in a while.
5573610	5574750	Actually, that's probably not true.
5574770	5578031	I know we played some last week, but you know, I want to hear some EX2 stuff.
5578051	5579252	Just play the music.
5579412	5580432	That's right, we're going to play the music.
5581813	5584934	Let's start it off with a little bit of Sneaker Pimps.
5585114	5586995	We'll be back after this, kids, with more Orange Lounge Radio.
5591156	5592117	Sneaker Pimps.
5625161	5626812	Thank you for watching!
5706220	5707401	Thanks for watching!
5767975	5769057	Thanks for watching!
5913683	5914343	Thanks for watching!
5977495	5978336	Thank you for watching!
6036315	6039576	Easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song.
6040256	6041896	Orange Lounge Radio.
6043777	6047357	We are back on Orange Lounge Radio on this episode 160.
6048017	6050178	A nice round number there.
6050218	6050918	That's 8 times 20.
6051038	6053759	Wait till nine episodes down the road.
6053819	6053979	I know, 169.
6054019	6055299	What are we going to do?
6055319	6057619	We're going to have to invite Mr. Spanky back.
6057699	6058860	Maybe bring his hag, Betty.
6058980	6059780	You know who we need?
6059860	6060140	We need...
6061400	6062160	I'm just pixie dust!
6086693	6088974	I miss Pixie Dust 24-Hour Fitness
6110403	6119474	They actually made a deal with Konami and they're going to be incorporating Dance Dance Revolution arcade machines in the kids clubs portion of 24 Hour Fitness.
6120234	6126021	In return, Konami is going to put a 30 day pass into the gym in the game.
6126341	6130086	So like when you buy a copy of DDR, you're going to get a free 30 day pass for 24 Hour Fitness.
6131366	6131826	Let's see.
6132347	6143291	Konami Director of Business Partnerships Clara Gilbert said, Bringing the health and fitness benefits of DDR to 24-hour fitness is an unbeatable combination in helping kids and adults stay in shape while having fun.
6143351	6150273	By placing DDR in 24-hour fitness locations, we strive to help kids and adults achieve their fitness goals in an unintimidating and fun way.
6150613	6153214	I didn't know that kids go to 24-hour fitness.
6153274	6155895	I thought that just closeted married men go there.
6157521	6160222	No, I... And then they just... They should have fuck-fuck resolution.
6160782	6161322	Resolution.
6161402	6161902	Revolution.
6161982	6163342	I remember dance-dance-fuck.
6163763	6166343	It's fun for the whole family is the idea, Extifer.
6166543	6168124	Or gay married men.
6171744	6175605	I don't think that's... Or gay married men.
6175685	6179126	They're not going to put this in every 24-hour... Gay men can't get married silly.
6182247	6182707	Yes, they can.
6182727	6184007	The married kind can.
6185928	6186188	Anyway...
6187475	6188996	I just kind of want to point out, what do you guys think?
6189136	6190016	Good idea, bad idea?
6191457	6193778	DarkSakura, you're a gym-going member here.
6193938	6194358	What do you think?
6194378	6196199	It should go to California Family Fitness.
6196639	6198560	We have a California Family Fitness nationwide.
6199000	6201081	So, if you go to California Family Fitness.
6201642	6203623	Well, they could sign a deal, too, maybe.
6203683	6204023	I don't know.
6204263	6204623	Probably not.
6204643	6206124	So that I can play DDR at my gym.
6206824	6208085	But you can play DDR at home.
6209866	6212207	You know, I miss good idea, bad idea.
6212987	6213447	Okay.
6214027	6215048	How is the greatest...
6216158	6218799	Well, is there something you want to say about this, good idea, bad idea-wise?
6222281	6224422	Good idea, putting DDR in the gyms.
6224562	6227843	Bad idea, the only DDR they're going to be able to put in the gyms is DDR USA.
6229604	6230384	Not necessarily.
6230444	6233205	No, the machines, they're not over here.
6233465	6235046	They're not supposed to be here.
6235486	6237767	You know they'll be extremely... Deny everything.
6237947	6239368	You know, maybe they'll make a new DDR.
6240243	6240943	Right.
6241483	6242344	I know, right.
6242404	6244024	But what about that thing that they were testing?
6244244	6246425	Remember a while back they were testing something for gyms?
6246485	6251887	And true, it was supposed to be like a, it had like karate kicks in it and stuff.
6251927	6252767	I don't remember what was in it.
6252787	6255268	It was like a multi-person DDR thing, and I don't think it was for kids.
6255348	6257088	But maybe it's something like that.
6257828	6259049	Maybe it's a special DDR.
6260009	6263950	What if the new DDR wasn't for arcades but for 24-hour fitness?
6263970	6264931	Wouldn't that be hilarious?
6265111	6269112	We need Patapata in the gym because that's a better workout, I think.
6269710	6282535	I'm telling you, fuck, fuck, revolution, and it's going to be in the showers, and all the closeted gay guys are going to be all on that.
6282995	6284956	They're going to be all on that.
6285957	6287217	Thank you for sharing, Extover.
6287277	6287637	Oh, no problem.
6288838	6290338	That's what it was called, DDR Studio.
6291359	6292079	Somebody mentioned that.
6293540	6297001	They could take one of the PlayStation 2 games and just put it in a cabinet.
6297541	6298322	What if they just did that?
6298342	6299382	What do you think of that, Loki?
6300236	6300456	Huh?
6300636	6300977	Crap.
6303058	6303378	Crap.
6303819	6304999	What if it was Extreme 2?
6305200	6305980	Extreme 2 is pretty cool.
6308442	6308882	It wouldn't work.
6309583	6309883	Why not?
6310583	6311564	It'd have to do a new build.
6313105	6314566	How easily would it be deported?
6315707	6316107	Extremely.
6316868	6317548	Why don't they do it then?
6317669	6318089	They could do it.
6318269	6318529	Lazy.
6318769	6319250	They might do it.
6319410	6321111	I still stand by Potapota in the gym.
6321571	6324954	Aren't they going to have to edit the game somehow to put the 24-hour fitness logo in it?
6326215	6326635	Possibly.
6326795	6329357	So, while they're at it, they can change all the songs and stuff.
6330310	6332071	I bet you this will be some type of special machine.
6332171	6332652	Just you wait.
6334212	6334332	No.
6334933	6337554	I want to ask you something real quick, Loki, because this is on another subject.
6337614	6339575	Something that's been going around on the DDR forums.
6339956	6342837	What's the last you've heard on a release date for Ultramix 3?
6343137	6345539	Because some people are saying it's been bumped back from the second.
6346499	6347720	It never was on the second.
6348200	6351162	Oh, I thought... No, you posted some news article on the website and said it was on the second.
6351202	6351862	That was a while ago.
6351882	6356605	No, it's like on the... I don't want to say it's the second week, I think.
6356985	6358145	It only got pushed back a week.
6358245	6358506	I mean...
6360305	6361806	I can't remember if it was the second or third week.
6361886	6363126	Everything's in the third week.
6363166	6365087	I mean, there's like 100 games coming out in the third week.
6365167	6366267	It's just retarded.
6366807	6371109	But, yeah, if anything, I pushed back only a week or two.
6371269	6374190	And it was, I think, relatively around the same.
6374250	6376991	I think some folks are saying the 16th now, like two weeks later.
6377091	6377691	It would make sense.
6377791	6379232	Everything's coming out on the 16th.
6379552	6380312	Everything.
6380492	6382673	I mean, just too many games.
6382693	6389155	I can confirm that because of the tournament that we're working on that I have had no time to work on.
6389375	6389655	Okay.
6390855	6391335	Very interesting.
6391515	6397737	I just wanted to clear that up, because I know it was on some web forums, and I was like, well, Loki did say that, like, five months ago, so it might be different now.
6397777	6398517	It was a while ago.
6398557	6400297	Of course they're going to move the date around.
6401017	6404678	I haven't updated on every single thing I hear about, you know, so.
6405158	6407759	Well, you might want to post a little update to our thing.
6407779	6408939	Well, I don't want to, like, update it.
6408959	6410700	Okay, yeah, now it's coming out this day.
6411040	6414140	For all those people waiting for Advent Children at the end of January now, so.
6416921	6417101	Yeah.
6417541	6417781	All right.
6420575	6422376	Let's go to the cage match.
6423376	6424017	You guys ready for this?
6426418	6428039	Yeah, because I actually kept my promise.
6429379	6430820	Goody, goody, goody, I'm so excited.
6430880	6437764	Okay, in the meantime, while I'm setting up cage match, DarkSakura, why don't you plug some of the other great programming we have here on Orange Launch Radio.
6438484	6440965	You mean Pump Up the Volume, which is every other week?
6441446	6441646	Yes.
6442046	6445808	It's supposed to be on Tuesdays, Pump Up the Volume, where I play...
6446621	6447522	X to First Case of the Mondays
6466445	6466885	Woo!
6467646	6470107	And aren't we supposed to do a fuck-off show?
6470247	6471628	Like, weren't we supposed to do that?
6471768	6472789	Like, but it was too late.
6472809	6474209	We need to do a fuck-off show.
6474389	6475750	Yeah, that would be really cool.
6476211	6477111	What is the fuck-off show?
6477871	6480853	That's when we get really bored and just randomly do shows.
6480873	6482754	Come on the air and just fuck off?
6484435	6485436	I want a fuck-on show.
6487237	6489938	Fuck-on, fuck-off, the fucker.
6491579	6493040	Alright, you guys ready for tonight's cage match?
6493433	6494975	Oh, I don't know Rob Roberts, are we?
6495375	6496036	I think we are.
6496376	6496797	Okay.
6497818	6500881	The Way the Cage Match Works, we're going to play three songs for you guys.
6501101	6504305	Last week's winner and two brand new songs, as chosen by our hosts.
6504845	6512053	And you're going to vote for your favorite, and the winning song goes into rotation all week long here on Orange Lounge Radio's Bomani and Video Game Music programs.
6513462	6516463	Alright, we're going to start it off tonight with last week's winner.
6516903	6524366	Last week, I let Miklatov pick a song for me, because I was constantly losing the cage match, and go figure, the damn song won.
6525487	6528488	And he still hates me this week over the World of Warcraft thing.
6528508	6529188	The bastard.
6530929	6532789	So let's see if it wins the second week in a row.
6532829	6534490	It's a little drum and bass-y song.
6534890	6539272	The song is called Hold Your Color, and it's by a group called Pendulum, and it's song number one tonight.
6539452	6539652	Enjoy.
6651542	6653443	Okay, that was song number one in tonight's Cage Match.
6653483	6654983	Pendulum with Hold Your Color.
6656503	6657444	I love something that can hold.
6658204	6658604	All right.
6659044	6664665	We're going to get into song number two tonight in tonight's Cage Match, and song number two is actually going to be Loki's pick.
6665766	6667206	Loki, what did you pick for us tonight?
6668807	6670547	I figured if we can't beat him, join him.
6671247	6677429	So we have also from the Hold Your Color album by Pendulum, track two, which is...
6678739	6679959	Actually, take that back.
6680219	6681900	Make it track 9 out here.
6682120	6682860	Oh, god damn you.
6682920	6683900	You can't change on me.
6683960	6684500	Yes, I can.
6685460	6685820	Fine.
6685960	6686240	Track 9.
6687501	6687821	All right.
6689261	6690021	Can you do this?
6690361	6694102	Is this legal in the cage match rulebook?
6694142	6694842	The bylaws?
6694882	6697162	That you can put in a song by the same artist?
6697262	6698643	I protest vehemently.
6698723	6700643	Just to spite the person who won?
6700883	6701183	Yes.
6702843	6703363	Bastard.
6705764	6706324	I hate you.
6708729	6709991	Alright, so it's out here.
6710792	6713837	Song number two in tonight's cage match, Pendulum with Out Here.
6714599	6715260	Enjoy it.
6928391	6929691	Thanks for watching!
7041483	7042364	Thank you for watching!
7085307	7091010	On song number two tonight, Pendulum with Out Here was the name of that song.
7091050	7098014	Let's go around and see what everybody thought of song number two, which, by the way, was the same artist as song number one, you bastard.
7098494	7099115	DarkSakura.
7101696	7105358	I really liked it, but it made me think of music from Tekken 5 and Tekken 4.
7106819	7113503	I really liked that game, but it just... You know, it was really... It was good, but it seemed very long.
7113583	7114123	I mean, at...
7115197	7116538	I really like it a lot.
7117319	7119541	But there's something that bugs me about it that I can't really put my finger on.
7119761	7120081	It gives a 9.
7120141	7121082	It's pretty good.
7121742	7123824	Loki.
7124685	7125906	It was really cool.
7126126	7133271	I like the album because I acquired it after listening to the song on last week's episode.
7134472	7135533	So yeah, it gives a 9.
7136934	7141498	By the way, totally off topic, and I just remembered this when she was talking about puppies.
7142273	7149262	I was walking through Kings Beach and they had a store called Dog Baker and I thought, Amal, do they bake dogs there?
7149282	7150683	I'm like, that's pretty wrong.
7150703	7151785	No, I know what that place is.
7152245	7154208	They make dog biscuits.
7155449	7156110	They cook puppies.
7156490	7156871	Extra firm.
7158418	7159299	Uh, 10.
7159399	7161840	That song was music to fuck to.
7162000	7163741	I really, really enjoyed that song.
7163761	7164982	It was a good sex song.
7165622	7168984	Um, and, uh, you know, Shane has good taste in music.
7169404	7171065	Don't, God, don't inflate his ego.
7171105	7171546	God, don't.
7171566	7171926	No, no, no, no, no.
7171986	7180851	I'm just gonna say, he's serving as an inspiration behind the first song that I'm gonna play on my show, X the First Case of the Mondays, airing a week from tomorrow.
7181011	7181131	Okay.
7182714	7183775	My thoughts on the song.
7183895	7184755	My song was better.
7184875	7185475	It really was.
7185575	7192218	That was too slow and mellow, and you should vote for mine instead, because that one was too... I went to sleep.
7193259	7194559	I agree, your song was better.
7194940	7201122	But see, the thing is, though, I had to put a song in now so that I can make the final modifications for the song next week.
7201182	7208646	I give that song a two for the number of Pendulum songs we have in Cage Match tonight, and because mine was better.
7209166	7210647	Come on, Jamie, put in a Pendulum song.
7210747	7211507	Angel, your thoughts.
7213157	7213997	Your rating.
7214357	7214838	There we go.
7215098	7216878	I don't know.
7216998	7217738	I'll give it a 10.
7217918	7220239	Just because I like it.
7220399	7221039	I like it a lot.
7221900	7227501	I was going to say good music to... Have sex to?
7227661	7228042	No.
7228202	7232903	Good music to... Have sex to?
7233263	7234423	Digitally pee to?
7234624	7235104	Paint.
7235764	7236344	Paint.
7236884	7238385	You sick people.
7241479	7245284	I don't know about your water sports, Angel, but... DarkSakura!
7246305	7246806	Jesus.
7247126	7248748	What do you have for us tonight?
7248888	7250030	Did you make good on your thread?
7250330	7254355	I said I was going to put ABBA in, but I forgot that I can't find my copy of ABBA Gold.
7254976	7256959	So I put an ABBA cover in.
7258399	7263201	So this is, I don't know if this is the 18th, because it said it was the 18th.
7263421	7264462	Yes, it's the 18th.
7264702	7267683	But it's the erotic remix of SOS.
7267783	7272425	Which I have a feeling is a false labeling, because I do not know of any time erotic actually mixed the songs.
7272705	7274706	This could actually just be the erotic version for all we know.
7275186	7279288	It could be, but that's how I've had it for years, and I never knew the difference.
7279308	7283089	So some type of remix of SOS by ABBA, one way or another.
7283289	7285930	Yeah, I said I would put in ABBA, this is something ABBA.
7286130	7287471	Alright, here it is.
7288246	7294751	Where are those happy days that seem so hard to find?
7311241	7333535	I tried to reach for you, but you have closed your mind Whatever happened to our love, I wish I understood It used to be so nice, it used to be so good So when you need me darling, can't you hear me S.O.S. ?
7348606	7351734	How can I even try to go on When you're gone and gone
7376514	7377756	I wish I understood
7403576	7407520	When you're gone, when you're gone, how can I even try to know why?
7407540	7411325	When you're gone, when you're gone, no one's right, how can I even know why?
7431288	7434796	Oh, when you hear me darling, can't you hear me SOS?
7487819	7492747	Alright, that was song number three in tonight's cage match, the 18th... Oh, crap.
7494450	7495832	Wham, just like totally crashed on me.
7495872	7496473	That was weird.
7497815	7498176	Wow.
7498897	7499338	Dead air.
7499358	7499939	That's not good.
7499959	7500099	Shit.
7503803	7507905	Okay, well, let's go around and see what everybody thought of, um, we'll just have to not have background music right now.
7508125	7510106	Or maybe you can have explosive diarrhea.
7510226	7511747	Yeah, let's do that, let's do that.
7511767	7512548	Since you said shit.
7512568	7512628	Ass.
7512808	7515289	Alright, let's go around and see what everybody thought of that song.
7515529	7519131	Um, song number three, uh, 18s with S.O.S., starting off with Dark Sakura.
7519151	7523814	Um, I Need Help, S.O.S.
7524934	7525235	Okay.
7525635	7528336	Um, I actually like that song, um, so it gets an eight.
7530117	7530417	Okay.
7531018	7531298	Loki.
7532498	7533359	I didn't like it.
7534538	7535298	It's just not for me.
7535318	7539540	It's too, I don't know, too happy.
7541861	7542061	Too gay.
7542201	7544022	Yes, it's too gay.
7544082	7545963	It's too flaming gay.
7545983	7547464	That's why I don't like the song.
7547504	7548244	It's too sky.
7548264	7553086	Let's check and see what DRUK has to say about sim updates.
7554006	7554747	Great radio.
7556447	7560789	Hey, listen, okay, if something actually happened in the sim world, I would know about it.
7561509	7562830	Sakurina says they have some news.
7563931	7565032	What, okay, whatever.
7566292	7567053	What news do you have?
7569874	7571035	I don't know, I'm waiting to see.
7571755	7574216	In today's news, people smoked crack.
7576477	7583721	So anyways, yeah.
7583741	7583921	Yeah.
7584061	7584601	I got nothing.
7584641	7587002	I'm tallying cage match votes, you guys need to figure out if they're kind.
7587042	7589043	I got nothing, but no, um, no really.
7589443	7592305	As far as official sim files go, um...
7593971	7596032	Still working on the official stuff.
7596673	7599074	Looks like to me, though, that they're probably not done.
7601816	7609101	Okay, Socorino, what Socorino wanted to share is that the VJ Army forums are starting their own collection of Stepmania sim files for Happy Sky.
7609742	7610502	The whole community.
7611703	7612323	That's the big news.
7614665	7614885	Wow.
7615786	7616026	Okay.
7617287	7617727	There you have it.
7618988	7619288	Hooray!
7619588	7621350	More step files for Beatmania songs.
7621390	7621990	Just what we needed.
7622654	7623755	We don't have any of those.
7623795	7624856	We've never had those before.
7626077	7626738	What's Beatmania?
7629220	7630941	Beatmania, 2DX, whatever you want to call it.
7631702	7634764	Is that when you turn into a maniac and beat someone?
7634944	7635205	Yes.
7636986	7638347	Did you want me to say Hip Hop Mania?
7640549	7641830	Everybody loves the Hip Hop Mania.
7643772	7645353	I remember that thing.
7645393	7646754	Hip Hop Mania rocks.
7648015	7648356	Yo.
7648976	7649797	We're going to go break.
7650575	7650955	Diggity.
7651215	7664584	When we come back for the break, we're going to announce tonight's Cage Match winner, and we're going to get into the FUs of the week, because I know you kids are angsty, and Xtrafer wants to give a movie review, although I didn't think he saw anything this week, so I'm going to be a little bit surprised, surely.
7666625	7668126	All right, so we'll be back after this.
7668146	7673490	We're going to start it off with a little bit of, I think we'll start off with some Daikinkai.
7673610	7674130	How's that sound?
7674750	7675431	We'll be back after this.

8124528	8128310	That's us, Orange Lounge Radio.
8128450	8129711	You know that movie was on TV today.
8146291	8149092	Well, that sounds awfully a lot like Jamie there in the promo.
8149112	8150612	Do we want people to kiss our ass?
8152372	8153172	Yes!
8154313	8154873	Absolutely.
8155193	8156513	We love it when people kiss our ass.
8156833	8157913	But not literally.
8158054	8158994	You can kiss our ass.
8159114	8160394	Kissing ass is good.
8160434	8161074	You can kiss our ass.
8161094	8162594	I only like it when it's my husband.
8162614	8163195	Oh, okay.
8163795	8164215	No!
8164795	8171416	You can kiss our ass by voting us a five on your player window or voting us on Podcast Alley because she knows no one else did this month.
8171756	8173457	That makes me sad, people.
8173497	8174377	Kiss our ass.

8212421	8213662	Listen to Orange Lounge.
8213742	8214102	All right.
8214702	8220904	I guess this show is only going to get gayer because we are going to allow Extifer to do his movie review.
8221124	8221884	Don't play the music.
8226986	8228046	I just, I don't know.
8228826	8229547	I don't know about that.
8229567	8230787	All right, what did you see this week?
8232139	8239543	Well, I didn't see it this week, but I just thought, I mean, it was kind of like a spur-of-the-moment idea that I would review Deep Impact.
8240723	8246306	Because Gene Shalit of Today called it a thriller with brains.
8247447	8254610	And Jeffrey Lyons of NBC TV said it was exhilarating, the special effects highlight of the year.
8255543	8259104	Which really nobody saw Deep Impact because they all saw that other one.
8259624	8261125	I saw Deep Impact in the theater.
8261205	8261745	I did too.
8262285	8264746	Actually, I liked it better than the other one.
8265146	8265606	What's it called?
8265626	8266046	Armageddon.
8266186	8268767	I was going to say Asteroid, but that was the one on TV.
8268867	8272188	I liked Deep Impact because Taya Leone died in it.
8272829	8275049	And sorry to ruin it for you, but she died in it and I hate her.
8275629	8278530	Dan says they're doing one about hurricanes called Category 7.
8278650	8280271	I'm like, that's insulting.
8283863	8286404	So, Extrovert, what do you think of it?
8286844	8289625	Well, I think it was a good movie.
8289766	8297069	I think it was kind of cheesy or whatever, but I thought it had a little bit more drama in it than the other movie, Armageddon.
8297089	8297829	Drama!
8297889	8298489	Yeah, drama.
8298569	8301490	It had some drama in it, and we all loved it.
8301931	8302851	We all ate it up.
8304192	8305952	No, but it was really good.
8306613	8311615	I think there should be a porn called Deep Impact, and if there hasn't been yet, I think they should make one.
8312734	8326024	because then it would be like about a giant cock headed towards some unsuspecting guy's anus and then, you know, he can't escape it and there's going to be a white wave at the end of the movie.
8328366	8329046	What do you think, Rob?
8329666	8331108	I think it's a seller.
8331128	8332509	I think you're an asshole.
8332589	8339814	You know, people make, it's a billion dollar industry, the porn business and I mean, a lot of people buy that gay porn
8341167	8353926	Even straight guys I think that gay porn is funny I think that all porn is funny It's great Hello, it's great This is all about Jeff Stryker He's kind of gay for pay But he's funny
8355044	8358425	He is funny because he's like, oh, I want to do you.
8358725	8359925	He's hilarious.
8360165	8362666	And then you hear a horse go in the background.
8364706	8365786	I think that he's hilarious.
8365806	8366806	Have you seen that scene yet?
8367307	8367987	No, I haven't.
8368127	8368887	I should show it to you.
8368907	8369287	I need to.
8369307	8369887	It's great.
8369987	8371327	Are you doing a movie review?
8371927	8372808	Oh, Deep Impact.
8373928	8374348	Rent it.
8374888	8375288	Buy it.
8375408	8375788	I don't know.
8375968	8378629	Like, it's probably on eBay for like two bucks.
8378849	8383010	I mean, you may be able to get it, pick it up at Walmart in their bargain bin.
8383710	8384650	Is it called a bargain bin?
8385756	8387858	The $5 bin, maybe.
8389139	8390460	Watch it with your kids.
8391360	8393102	I have nothing.
8395303	8396284	Vote for song number two.
8398325	8398846	And fuck to it.
8399746	8402688	Alright, let's see tonight's winner of the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match.
8402728	8406251	Speaking of which, it's a little late to have your plug in there because we already have a winner for tonight's Cage Match.
8406711	8407692	Are you ready to find out who it is?
8409273	8413076	The winner of tonight's Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match is...
8417148	8417708	Where's the song?
8417909	8418309	Oh, here it is.
8423052	8424313	Song number one.
8425854	8428436	Pendulum Hold Your Color wins song number one.
8428696	8430678	Loki, suck it, Loki.
8430798	8431838	I mean, I could take him.
8431998	8432639	I could take Rob.
8432659	8432959	Suck it.
8433940	8435341	More ABBA next week.
8435501	8436702	More Pendulum next week.
8437662	8438103	Great.
8438463	8441145	Yeah, I'll have to counteract that with an echo image.
8442318	8444239	DarkSakura, why is it that we do the FUs of the week every single week?
8444259	8446440	Oh, by the way, kids, you can send in your FUs to me right now, but keep them short!
8469733	8483502	Why is it we do the FUs of the week every single week?
8483522	8487885	FU to old people who think that they have perfect night vision and can drive.
8489225	8490386	No, you really can't.
8490766	8491307	You suck.
8492688	8492768	Um...
8496338	8503546	F you to being busy and F you to my medication that I can't really go into too much detail about on the air.
8505768	8506929	F you to hormones.
8507930	8508331	I'm done.
8510092	8511394	Let's get to Loki's F yous.
8515198	8519382	My F yous first begins with the Hyatt at Lake Tahoe.
8519952	8521954	Fuck you to their service because it sucks.
8522014	8524456	First they gave me the wrong room with the wrong bed in it.
8524956	8533243	Then they tried to charge me $3 for something that was supposedly taken out of the minibar despite the fact that they never gave me the key for the minibar and it was zip-tied shut.
8533403	8535425	So that would have been some magic.
8536225	8542190	Anyways, also fuck you to having to make the two-hour drive to Lake Tahoe.
8542611	8547655	I was actually driving around on the weekend and there's these stupid people in SUVs trying to tailgate me
8548508	8560034	along these roads that are really windy and stuff, and the speed limit's only 45 anyways, and the guy is driving down the center line, because he's trying to pass me on double yellow, so fuck you to the fucking SUV drivers.
8560114	8567538	At least, though, they're in Tahoe, where there are actual hills and snow, so SUVs are allowed there, but yeah, they still suck.
8568879	8577684	And finally, just fuck you to the fact that I was actually bored enough to bid on some item on eBay for God knows how much money
8578143	8590626	and now I have this stupid poster that may be autographed by the entire cast of True Crimes New York but now I have this thing that I paid way too much money for and it sucks.
8590666	8600468	But at least it went to charity so I guess that's okay but still too much money spent this weekend and fuck you the Hyatt again for having their slots being way too damn tight.
8600588	8603529	It's just like playing in any casino so fuck them.
8604649	8605369	That's all I have.
8612864	8614825	I'm actually really not that angsty, all things considered.
8615145	8618005	I am really angsty at one situation right now, but I can't talk about it on air.
8618085	8625807	But it's something related to something I can't go to, that I wanted to go to, and now I can't go to it.
8626267	8629628	And that makes me upset, because I don't like it when I don't get my way.
8630128	8633089	So F you to me not getting my way.
8634089	8638511	And an F you to traffic on Watt Avenue the other day, because it was stupid.
8639371	8639511	And...
8641198	8643239	An F you to candy corn, because it's really addicting.
8643259	8644779	But you know what's even more addicting than candy corn?
8644819	8647100	It's that Indian corn, the one that tastes like chocolate.
8647960	8648860	This shit is so good.
8648880	8650561	I'm telling you, this shit is so good.
8651881	8653382	Just don't eat candy.
8654922	8655703	I can't do that.
8656703	8658423	They make sugar-free candy corn, by the way.
8658903	8660224	Ooh, maybe, now that maybe I could do.
8660244	8662325	But it makes you take a shit really bad if you eat too much of it.
8662385	8663205	At least I'd lose weight.
8666446	8666826	That's it.
8668266	8670187	Extaper, let's get to you F yous tonight.
8672166	8699337	uh f you fuck you to me because I keep talking about sex I need to get laid and I I'm just talking about it way too much um so yeah fuck fuck you to me hopefully soon um and yeah I think that's pretty much it and I know there was something I was thinking about and I can't remember it so on to Angel Angel
8700771	8727596	I have viewed my computer deciding to kill itself during a Scarlet Monastery run, which I don't know if you guys have all gotten that high or not, but yeah, that wasn't cool when it did that, because I had other stuff to do this weekend after I was playing World of Warcraft, so luckily it died after my portfolio was due for school, so.
8728499	8730480	Let's get into the chatroom FUs.
8748564	8760066	Sephiroth1215 wants to give an FU to Digital Life doing everything on Saturday leaving me with nothing cool and not one thing to do without waiting an hour just to play a new SNK game or a new Sonic game.
8760106	8763187	The only games I actually wanted to play other than the ones I already did.
8765307	8770728	Ron Chan would like to say an FU to Cablevision for coming to an install to replace a cable modem.
8771028	8772409	Something that I could have done myself.
8772629	8774069	I didn't need to be up at 8am for this.
8775376	8792564	NintendoManiac64 says F you to myself for not even touching my homework yet and it's like midnight here on the east coast F you to our new Netgear wireless router that killed the internet on one of our computers and required a reformat to get the router to work F you to my laptop for not being able to run Quake 2 using OpenGL at a smooth speed
8794085	8798927	Tomo-kun says, fuck my friend for overdosing on a ton of nutmeg last night at the homecoming dance.
8799407	8802568	She knew she was allergic to it, and then it makes you more sick than high.
8802968	8804149	It was attempted suicide.
8804309	8808150	Wow, fuck you for attempting suicide by overdoing something you're allergic to.
8811051	8813272	And then he said don't read something, but I did, I'm sorry.
8814653	8818474	Dark Knight says, F you to returning to work today and almost died of heat exhaustion.
8818894	8820815	And F you for my vacation coming to an end.
8822242	8825745	Jaded 2005 says, F you to my internet for dying during the cage match.
8826866	8832270	Sakarina says, F you to my teachers for only putting 10% of the marks that should be on my midterm report card.
8832630	8835893	I'm not complaining about the actual marks that are there, but the ones that aren't there.
8837894	8840736	Miklatov says, F you to me for giving up Taco Bell.
8841097	8843318	If you know me in person, you know how big of a deal this is.
8844039	8845120	Extrovert just gasped.
8845140	8845580	Hahaha.
8846361	8851386	FU also to Milpitas Golf Land because that place is too ghetto to house a perfectly lovely pump exceed machine.
8851706	8854709	But there was a guy that liked you at the one that we have over here.
8854990	8857232	DarkLionXVI says one FU for tonight.
8857372	8866000	FU to Cox Communications for charging 75 bucks just to change the splitter that connects both my TV and cable modem.
8866241	8869384	A few days later, I'm still getting disconnects due to line and signal issues.
8873871	8880702	DarkTetsuya says F you to my crappy connection as always and F you to Squeenix for not giving me my slime keychain with my DQ8 demo.
8882697	8885599	Goggle says, and I almost said Google, but I stopped myself.
8885659	8890642	Goggle says, froke everyone at the homecoming dance for stopping when Dancing Queen came on.
8890942	8892864	Just because it's not rap doesn't mean he can't dance.
8892944	8894324	Hey, I would have danced to Dancing Queen.
8894825	8896566	It says dancing in its name.
8896826	8897907	I would have danced to that.
8898307	8899468	I would have danced to it.
8899728	8903270	You know what I played at my first homecoming dance?
8903390	8904271	It just dates me.
8905211	8906032	The Humpty Dance.
8907768	8908489	It's your chance.
8909109	8910410	I don't remember what they played.
8910910	8911651	A lot of Nirvana.
8911671	8913492	Because my first homecoming was in 1990.
8914873	8917835	Oh, I didn't go to my homecoming dance.
8918475	8919576	No, I didn't go to the prom.
8920477	8926200	I was at Red Robin last night watching all the people in their dresses, and it was like a fashion show.
8927081	8928722	Fuck all those anorexic skinny people.
8928802	8932244	Goggle, invite us to the prom next time, and we'll dance to Dancing Queen with you.
8932264	8933805	Oh my god, I would so go to the prom.
8937395	8938256	Oh, I didn't see this.
8938276	8938596	I should.
8960285	8982411	SSJ100 Matt says F you to the Yankees for being knocked out of the playoffs Go White Sox F you to this show turning into Prawn Lounge Radio He he We're horny No apologies GS191 says Excuse me F you to my online class for fucking up again and making me retake midterms again F you to my online class period Online plus math equals bad
8983749	8990492	And lastly, but not leastly, Roz says, F you to my health teacher for accusing me of plagiarism.
8992852	8993713	Well, it's not healthy.
8994673	8996754	I double F you that because it's crappy.
8996774	8997254	You know what else?
8997774	8998034	You know what?
8998094	9000275	It's something about science teachers are total cunts.
9000395	9000956	I'll tell you why.
9001336	9003537	Because, like, I had a ball.
9003597	9004677	I don't care if I drop the C ball.
9004697	9005477	This guy deserves it.
9005817	9007118	My least favorite teacher of all time.
9008038	9009359	The Vampire Bat is a bat from Mexico.
9029116	9034622	We were all going around and what he did is he said, I'm going to give you three extra credit points after we handed in all our papers.
9034882	9040467	He says, I want to know what you really learned and I'm going to give you three extra credit points if you memorize the scientific name of your animal.
9041248	9043270	Well, I knew mine and I said it out loud.
9043310	9045092	He said, great, you get the three extra credit points.
9045573	9047034	Unfortunately, I'm going to flunk you on the paper.
9047294	9050798	In fact, the whole class he said this, I'm going to flunk you on the paper because your animal is not from North America.
9051565	9052206	That's bullshit.
9052246	9053228	I said, that's bullshit.
9053268	9054550	Mexico is in North America.
9054671	9055873	He says, no, that's Central America.
9056153	9058437	I said, I took him to task on this.
9058517	9062243	I said, what do you call the North American Free Trade Agreement, which involves Canada, US, and Mexico?
9064286	9065907	And I still, I didn't get it.
9066327	9071789	I just finally... That's fucking... I got a D. I got a D. You got a D. I got a D on the report.
9071809	9072929	I would have taken it to the principal.
9073029	9073770	I would have done it too.
9074250	9076211	I should have, but I... I have done that to teachers.
9076271	9077991	When I was a child, I was too passive.
9078331	9085274	I'm sorry if your teaching staff here is fucking incompetent, but... I will never forget that to this day, and this is why I hate biology.
9085294	9087435	That one incident is why I hate biology.
9087455	9092197	Your science teacher was a moron, because even named by the continents, Central America is just...
9092788	9094009	Talk to the principal!
9112912	9113433	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
9135988	9136629	And he died.
9136669	9137410	Karma, motherfucker.
9156710	9170776	You know what I feel so bad about during my high school years is because there was a teacher, my data processing teacher, who was going to flunk me on something, some random thing that I kind of stood up for myself for, and I yelled at the guy.
9170836	9175718	It was the only teacher that, well, one of the two teachers I yelled at my whole time going to school.
9176539	9179220	A couple years later, he died.
9179924	9181425	I don't know if he's...
9200417	9202938	He was a bastard, so he's probably in hell.
9203559	9207901	So I guess I should look down and say, hey, how's it going?
9208282	9209582	I'll see you in a couple years.
9210803	9211524	God, don't say that.
9211764	9212464	In a few years.
9212484	9213985	There's a few years on me.
9215006	9216847	The sad thing is my biology teacher was really old.
9216887	9217567	He is probably dead.
9217587	9218268	You know what I'm sad about?
9218288	9219588	He's been like ten years since high school.
9219889	9220689	You know what I'm sad about?
9220749	9220909	What?
9220989	9222010	That we haven't done a match game.
9223188	9224969	I know, we're not going to get to it either, probably.
9225389	9226009	Oh, darn!
9226109	9230111	I haven't written questions, so I'll write questions for next week, and we'll get to it for sure.
9230791	9234893	Anyway, so, now, the ironic thing is I'm a teacher now.
9235353	9237954	I just don't teach high school kids, but I teach... You teach something worse.
9238054	9243217	I teach adults, which is much worse in some scenarios, but, you know, for the most part, it's okay.
9244537	9246018	Actually, when I'm in class, everything is great.
9246378	9249199	It's everything I have to deal with outside of class that irks me, usually.
9249660	9250820	When I'm in class, everything's fine.
9251400	9252621	And I actually taught Extifer...
9253357	9254417	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
9281048	9287650	I would suggest things that might not have been in the material that they would need to know.
9287730	9291871	You know, that's how I got into training, though, where I work, is that I was sitting in the class as a student.
9291911	9296672	I was suggesting how to make it better, and that impressed the trainer, and she suggested I should be in it.
9297232	9301153	See, HR positions aren't opening up in my work, so I'm going into compliance if I get the job.
9301973	9302853	I want to be in HR.
9303293	9303973	That's one of my things.
9304013	9305174	I really do want to be in HR.
9305194	9308615	Well, this is great and all, but let's get into another statement.
9309155	9309875	So back to HR.
9309895	9310415	I want to be in it.
9311892	9313232	Yeah, you want to be all up in it, I'm sure.
9313292	9314913	Let's get back to Angel's water sports.
9314933	9315313	Humpin' resources.
9315873	9316093	Huh?
9316273	9317374	Humpin' resources.
9317794	9318794	The Humpty Dance resources.
9319034	9319214	All right.
9319514	9321295	I want to get back to Angel's water sports.
9321435	9322955	I don't want to get back into Angel's water sports.
9322975	9325376	Oh, okay, then we don't have to get to your water sports.
9325636	9327757	She's doing the blink thing, where she's like, blink, blink, what?
9327797	9328777	I like alcohol.
9330798	9335239	Alcohol makes you pee, and peeing has to do with Angel's water sports.
9335279	9336139	How about that, Angel?
9337620	9341401	No, but Jamie is the only one that successfully got me to drink liquor once.
9342304	9343084	That was cool.
9343304	9343645	Yeah.
9344445	9346005	I'm going to bring over some sake one day.
9346346	9346886	And did you pee?
9346986	9350367	Can I bring up an actually relevant Bomani story real quick?
9350387	9350727	Sure, Rod!
9350787	9355329	Okay, we're going to go to break and we're going to come back and do Ask Orange Lounge because the chat room is begging for it tonight.
9355969	9358830	Somebody gave me a link to this and I don't remember who now.
9358930	9359951	Oh, it was Goggle.
9360031	9360671	Goggle gave me this.
9360691	9361131	Thank you, Goggle.
9362068	9363669	Thank you for watching!
9378798	9382299	and it has to do with the Serious Games Summit.
9382379	9383439	Seriously, you guys, serious.
9383579	9389020	No, what it is, actually, it's going to be a, I guess, kind of summit thing going on.
9389200	9390721	It's actually going to happen in Washington, D.C.
9390761	9394702	at the Serious Games Summit and it's going to be Monday, October 31st.
9394742	9395342	Hey, that's Halloween.
9395742	9396742	From 4.15 p.m.
9396762	9397582	to 5.15 p.m.
9398062	9400263	It's a, like, session on...
9401224	9405165	Dance Dance Revolution, the most researched serious game ever.
9405305	9406505	Why and what have we learned?
9406525	9408806	And here's what it says on the little website synopsis.
9409206	9417408	DDR is a game, a social activity, a dance and performance platform, a community, a form of vigorous exercise, a weight loss tool, and more.
9417948	9421629	It serves different needs for different people and it has been put to many surprising uses.
9421969	9424970	This talk analyzes, or as I like to say, analyzes,
9425925	9430328	the appeal of DDR and the many ways it has been implemented and researched as a serious game.
9430688	9436851	It reviews current research finding and then examines the exergaming phenomenon in general and where it is heading.
9437552	9438993	And I bet you we won't be mentioned at all.
9440233	9442395	Dude, that's insulting because we're fabulous.
9443455	9447397	We are the backbone of the DDR community.
9451020	9453021	We are totally the backbone of the DDR community.
9453061	9455082	I mean, I know you're a moderator on DDR Freak and all, but
9455782	9460224	You know, DDR Freak was the backbone, I guess we're the tailbone.
9460345	9465167	DDR Freak, let's face it, DDR Freak jumped the shark a little while ago.
9465227	9467008	I can make no comment about that, sir.
9467048	9468629	DDR Freak jumped the shark a couple years ago.
9468669	9470130	I can make no comment about that, sir.
9470230	9471431	I like DDR Freak.
9471471	9472471	I'm not the UK form.
9473192	9473672	I know you do.
9474512	9475413	I love the UK form.
9475433	9476113	They jumped the shark.
9476313	9478034	Hey, UK form, I love you guys.
9478374	9479495	You're well behaved now.
9479595	9481356	We are the backbone of the DDR community.
9481856	9484698	You know what, actually, we're the backbone of the entire video gaming community, really.
9486144	9487905	Because we are the number one rated podcast.
9489467	9493550	I don't know about that, but we managed to win an award, and we're cool.
9494871	9495891	Adam Curry digs us.
9496131	9497352	That's right, Adam Curry likes us.
9498493	9499134	I like his hair.
9501375	9504258	Adam Curry, if you're listening, I want to know what hairstyle he has.
9504278	9505478	I'm sure Adam Curry's listening.
9505759	9508621	He's got nothing better to do than say, oh, I'm going to listen to Orange Lingerie tonight.
9509161	9515506	He's probably listening to his old tapes that he did, you know, DJing on MTV or whatever.
9516425	9517486	I like Adam Curry.
9517946	9519947	I had such a thing for Adam Curry when I was younger.
9519987	9520127	Really?
9520448	9521889	I kind of liked him too when I was younger.
9521909	9524270	And Colin Quinn, actually, because I liked his jaw.
9526291	9532075	If somebody would go to this lecture and tape it for us and get us a CD so we can mock it on air, that would be great.
9532956	9534317	No, I'm sure it will be interesting.
9534477	9536058	I'm curious to see what they have to say.
9536218	9536518	We'll see.
9538354	9539677	Alright, we'll be back after this.
9539717	9542421	We're going to take a quick Tucson break, then we're going to do some Ask Orange Lounge.
9542522	9544966	So send in your questions right now, kids.
9545587	9546388	We'll be back after this.
9718252	9724116	Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.
9725737	9727238	We're back on Orange Lounge Radio.
9733287	9736828	And we're going to get into a little segment here you guys know and love.
9737408	9739529	We're getting a lot of questions tonight, too, so we've got to get right into it.
9740069	9741109	It's Ask Orange Lounge.
9742509	9745090	Don't forget our podcast, boys and girls, which we do every week.
9746090	9748771	www.orangeloungeradio.com Click on the to-go edition.
9748831	9749551	Are you okay?
9749591	9751471	What the hell?
9752572	9753912	I'm making funny faces.
9753932	9754992	Why are you making faces?
9755352	9755972	Because I can.
9756312	9759013	We're going to do some Ask Orange Lounge.
9766153	9769115	Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.
9769615	9772776	What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?
9773297	9780240	Perhaps a question we will find the answer to is why Jamie is smiling when she comes out of the bathroom.
9782161	9783602	I am still going to kick you.
9785142	9785943	She's going to cut you.
9786083	9786543	I'm good.
9787003	9788063	Squeeze the ferret to death.
9788404	9797647	Nintendo Maniac 64 says, For the cage match, why can't there be a member chosen from each week and they get to submit one song to the cage match for the next week?
9798287	9803369	We do things like that occasionally, but it's our show and not your show.
9803569	9805230	And that's basically the main reason why.
9805650	9806811	No, in all seriousness.
9808130	9815935	Like, I let Mikulatov pick one, so sometimes, and sometimes, like, one of us won't be here, and we'll forget to have submitted a cage match song, so we'll just pick a random chatter to send a song.
9815955	9818337	So it does happen once in a while, it's just not a regular thing.
9818697	9821419	The cage match is long enough as it is, we don't want to add another song to it.
9823460	9827382	Uh, NintendoManiac64 also wants to know, we're gonna have time for some more Skype, right?
9827442	9830404	I just downloaded it and got it working, and I'm, like, uber excited for it.
9831085	9831245	Um, maybe.
9832686	9832966	Maybe.
9834668	9837170	Jaded2005 says, oh, this is actually a good question.
9837590	9841633	Jaded2005 wants to know, how did you first get into DDR?
9843815	9844856	Um, may I?
9845797	9846077	You may.
9846757	9849039	I was going to Anime Expo.
9849820	9850821	This was in 96?
9851962	9855064	No, no, no, no, no, no.
9855144	9855804	It was after that.
9855825	9858266	It was like 98 was my first Anime Expo.
9858687	9860528	And I got into Best Move right after that.
9861009	9862129	And then I went to...
9863410	9870277	Anime Expo the next year, which was AX99, and someone had the first DDR for PlayStation there.
9871057	9881047	And I was in the middle of the Busted Move 2 tournament, which really pissed me off, because I was beating everybody for a solid hour, and then decimated my first guy, got to the second guy, and got a faulty controller.
9881988	9883389	I was also cosplaying Shorty that year.
9885100	9912459	but I thought it was really cool because I heard KC and the Sunshine Band and so I had to get my own copy so I got my first DDR that I ever owned was like a burn of the first one and then I got a DDR for Dreamcast and then I played my first machine at the next AX which was a third mix so AX2000 was my first machine and AX99 was my first time playing DDR but I actually played Beatmania before that
9913849	9915270	and I played Dance Dance Dance, which sucked.
9917171	9921593	The first time I ever saw DDR was at Milpitas Golf Land and it was the same weekend I lost my virginity.
9922213	9923013	Just thought you'd like to know.
9923533	9926055	Can you describe that to us in detail?
9926355	9927055	Yes, actually.
9927195	9928596	First, no, I'm not going to.
9929336	9930977	You can't describe your DDR experience?
9931177	9931917	That's what I was asking.
9931957	9936959	I mean, why would I ask you to describe your first experience anal sex-wise?
9936979	9937180	Shut up.
9938655	9939435	God, take his mic away.
9939555	9939875	Do it.
9940116	9941556	This time don't give it back.
9941576	9942736	This time don't give it back.
9943317	9947378	How I got into DDR was I moved in with my roommate.
9950959	9951679	I was a fan of me.
9952040	9955921	I saw Beatmania one year and DDR the next year.
9956341	9960162	Bought both games and continue not to play them today.
9962663	9965244	I have a whole pile of 5 key Beatmanias that I don't play.
9966018	9971282	But yeah, for some reason I'm going to spend the money to build an arcade pad in... Oh, I already built arcade pads for DDR.
9971682	9973504	An arcade setup for Beatmania.
9974624	9975185	I don't know why.
9977447	9980429	Alright, Socorina has a couple questions we're going to run through here.
9980949	9985773	Socorina wants to know, when was the last time each Orange Lounge Radio crew member got a Brazilian wax?
9986633	9986854	Never.
9987114	9987374	Never.
9987394	9988275	Never.
9988295	9988575	Never.
9990081	9992483	I said I don't shave my genitals.
9992543	9994264	It's not a shave.
9994344	9995564	Who gave him the mic back?
9995744	9995985	Who?
9996105	9996625	Who did that?
9996965	9997625	Loki did.
9998106	10001928	You were responsible for keeping the microphone safe from his blasphemy.
10002028	10004990	Sakurina also wants to know, can Mr. Spanky get back on the show soon?
10005010	10006611	Blast for me, blast for you.
10006871	10008892	Yes, Mr. Spanky can come back on the show someday.
10009212	10010833	I don't know about soon.
10010873	10012534	We don't want him to jump the shark, but he'll be back.
10013400	10014341	We need Betty to come.
10016623	10020507	Can Xtifer get the mic back and start another sex-related joke for this week?
10021007	10021908	No, he can't.
10025131	10026072	You can next week.
10026713	10029735	Tomo Kun wants to know, what's your worst homecoming memory?
10031337	10034600	Junior homecoming, which I showed up for 30 minutes.
10035080	10036862	My date had a mullet, and I left.
10039324	10041425	I actually don't have negative homecoming stories to tell.
10041925	10042986	For the most part, they were pretty good.
10043026	10045127	You know, I first kissed a girl my freshman year at homecoming.
10045867	10047428	I had the flu for prom.
10048509	10050470	Why are you laughing at that, extrovert?
10051651	10057854	Because... I just want to know what went through that girl's mind when she kissed you.
10058514	10061976	Like, oh, that's more of a friend.
10062016	10063117	That's not a boyfriend.
10064938	10067119	Like, I don't know.
10067199	10067579	My mind...
10068803	10069103	It's gone.
10069243	10070223	Anyways.
10071484	10076005	No, actually, my ex, she sucked because she was... She wouldn't put out.
10076745	10077586	Well, that too, but no.
10077966	10084728	She was kind of... She played soccer and she injured her knee like four fucking years ago or something like that.
10085688	10091090	So, for whatever reason, it conveniently acted up whenever she'd go to a dance and she sucked.
10091490	10092730	So, anyways, the hell with her.
10094196	10099998	Gago wants to know, on the Serious Games Summit thing, just an aside, apparently my uncle is speaking that day on another topic.
10100338	10102179	I'll see if I can persuade him to go to the DDR thing.
10102899	10108761	Let us know if they're doing, like, because usually those Summit-type things, they sell CDs or something, but they're usually really expensive, but you never know.
10108781	10110302	We might be able to get a deal or something.
10110662	10111202	So that's cool.
10111662	10113423	Good luck to your uncle on whatever topic he's speaking on.
10113483	10116404	Did you both put on, like, lip gloss before you guys kissed?
10116424	10117444	Will you shut up?
10117524	10118324	Oh, my God.
10118344	10118945	Loki, kiss.
10118965	10119345	Loki.
10120505	10121245	Hold on to the mic.
10121265	10122146	Put on my lip gloss.
10122166	10122286	Okay.
10122306	10123206	Take the mic away.
10123326	10124086	Take the mic away.
10124746	10125726	My name is Rob Roberts.
10125766	10126127	Kiss me.
10126147	10127127	I'm just going to unplug it.
10127247	10129307	I'm just going to unplug him from the board so he can't speak.
10129327	10129968	No, let's cut it back.
10129988	10130768	Okay, good.
10132388	10133989	And you're giving him his own show?
10134549	10135989	Shame on you.
10136009	10136489	You know what?
10136529	10137330	I don't have to be here.
10138090	10140070	Nobody has to listen if they don't want to.
10140690	10146332	But if... Actually, he looks all offended.
10148653	10148913	Look.
10149533	10150053	Out the window?
10151389	10163454	Here's the thing though, if Extraverse Show gets lower ratings than Diversion did, which is going to be very hard to do, if Extraverse Show gets lower ratings than Diversion did, you are getting cancelled.
10166736	10166856	No!
10167589	10168090	RadioShack, $5.
10181698	10182679	Yeah, they're actually really cheap.
10182719	10190183	You can get a nice little headset at Target for $19.99, and that would be headphones with a little mic thing, which is good for TeamSpeak and stuff.
10190203	10196007	Actually, Office Depot was clearing out the Alta Glancing ones for $10, and Alta Glancing is really good.
10196787	10197267	Shop around.
10197287	10201690	If you're interested in buying on the Internet, check out Google's search thing.
10201770	10206733	I know that's kind of ironic that I'm telling you to go to Google, but they have that compare prices thing that's really cool.
10207634	10209335	I recommend if you're going to buy a...
10212057	10214579	Computer thing, make it a brand name like Logitech or something.
10215959	10218641	Greeny wants to know, do any of you play double mode?
10218961	10220141	Have you rolled up the king yet?
10220442	10223243	Can you substitute sound effects to bleep out profanity in the future?
10224343	10226044	Question number one, do any of you play on double mode?
10226164	10227885	I used to, but I'm too fat now.
10228906	10230607	DarkSakura, you used to play on double mode too, right?
10230647	10230987	Still do?
10231147	10233248	Actually, I used to do nothing but doubles for a little while.
10234669	10235489	That's all I play.
10236027	10237929	Loki, yeah, you play a lot of doubles, Loki.
10238229	10243355	Yeah, even now that I have, like, no stamina, I still play doubles, because singles is just not for me.
10243555	10244896	Ironic, we all play doubles.
10245337	10245877	That's kind of weird.
10246037	10249461	It's not at home, because, you know, I don't... Yeah, not at home, not at home, I only do it in the arcade.
10249961	10250462	That's kind of weird.
10251343	10252224	Have you rolled up the king yet?
10252244	10254206	No, in fact, I haven't played Katamari Damashii in a little while.
10254987	10256208	Anybody else, have you rolled up the king yet?
10256471	10257472	I have had no time to play.
10257492	10259713	I'm only playing the Japanese version for some reason.
10260234	10263256	Can you substitute sound effects to bleep out profanity in the future?
10263276	10266198	Dude, it's the motherfucking internet and we're going to say what we want.
10266258	10267259	And we don't have a delay to that.
10267299	10268480	Yeah, we don't have a delay or anything either.
10269821	10275285	Yeah, and you know who we would put in charge of the delay if we had one?
10275465	10275965	Exifer.
10277626	10278487	And you know that wouldn't work.
10280461	10287728	Ron Chan wants to know, how come you guys don't play the full versions of the songs that are in DDR, 2DX, and so forth?
10287768	10289009	We have.
10289189	10298337	We have in the past, and you hear that sometimes on the spin-off shows, but there's only been one lately, and she likes to play non-DDR stuff on her show, but she will once in a while, right?
10298497	10301600	I actually have done all the money shows, and I've played the long versions.
10302208	10303930	And every so often I sneak in the Korean stuff.
10326360	10333484	SSJ100, Matt wants to know, which would you rather see remade on a next-gen console, Chrono Trigger or Final Fantasy VII?
10335586	10335946	Neither.
10336026	10336706	Guardian Legend.
10337667	10338607	Yeah, Guardian Legend.
10338888	10340329	But if I had to choose between the two?
10340349	10341389	Yeah, if I had to choose between the two?
10341489	10344051	I would say Final Fantasy VII so that it actually looks good.
10346104	10348126	because Chrono Trigger was already perfect.
10348506	10353510	I'm going to say Chrono Trigger because I did not get into Chrono Trigger when it was on the Super Nintendo.
10353590	10355512	I never got what the big deal was about Chrono Trigger.
10355532	10358274	I mean, it was cool and all, but I did not nearly obsess over that game.
10358595	10362538	I think a remake might help kick my ass a little bit into giving it a second look.
10362558	10364280	I would have beaten Chrono Trigger.
10364340	10366481	I've gotten like seven of the 14 endings.
10368723	10370865	I got the Toriyama ending.
10370985	10371566	That was pretty cool.
10373999	10379223	Anybody else want to share what they would see remade on the next-gen console, Chrono Trigger or Final Fantasy VII?
10379263	10380644	Both can be remade anyways.
10381705	10386429	Chrono Trigger's going to be an MMO, and Final Fantasy VII's being remade for the PS3, so you'll get them both.
10386669	10390492	Leadfoot wants to know, should I buy In the Groove or just stick with DDR Extreme 2?
10392193	10397617	Well, if you are choosing between those two, buy Extreme 2, definitely.
10398258	10402802	If you're just kind of bored with Extreme 2 and you want a new game, I'm cool with In the Groove.
10402942	10403342	Pump it up.
10404403	10406545	Oh yeah, Pump It Up first though, honestly.
10407186	10408727	Buy Pump It Up before you buy In The Groove.
10409067	10410289	Seriously, Pump It Up's a great game.
10411450	10413111	If you get bored of those, go play Step Mania.
10413511	10414572	Then you could buy In The Groove.
10414733	10416694	In The Groove will hold you over.
10416955	10417235	It will.
10419901	10423124	Zaku says, here's a cool fact about this weekend's DDR tournament.
10423164	10424144	No more questions, guys.
10424385	10424925	No more questions.
10425285	10426086	Final call for questions.
10426626	10429789	Here's a cool fact about this weekend's DDR tournament that you probably didn't know.
10429849	10433271	There was one event called Iron Man in which you had to do an Oni course without the bar.
10433612	10439556	It was done on a DDR machine ghetto rigged to a PS2, both screen and pad, so folks had to do max period on an arcade pad.
10443079	10443419	Yikes.
10445741	10448503	Ron Chan says, do you like this as the name of your spin-off show?
10448603	10449524	The Sky Effect.
10450353	10454976	I liked, somebody suggested This Week in Sky as a parody of This Week in Tech.
10455016	10456097	I should do This Week in Sky.
10456977	10463622	Although it would sound like something that would be exploring like me and I don't know about that.
10463982	10465723	The Life Aquatic with Rob Roberts.
10465783	10468165	How about We've Blown It Sky High.
10472453	10473814	Alright, we're done with that story.
10473854	10475555	You know, I'm not going to say anything crude.
10475675	10479678	I just thought that The Life Aquatic starring Rob Roberts would be a good title.
10479698	10480659	The Life Bimonic.
10481179	10482140	The Life Bimonic.
10482340	10482660	Yeah.
10483701	10485762	And my show is not going to be crude, by the way.
10485903	10489625	I mean, I may say some crude things, but just listen in.
10489665	10490226	It'll be fun.
10490606	10490866	Alright.
10491787	10492147	Final thoughts?
10492167	10493648	Say something good about it, Rob.
10493748	10495629	It's going to be fabulous.
10496030	10497991	When I say fabulous, I mean stupid.
10498211	10498832	I'm just kidding.
10498932	10499472	It'll be fine.
10499492	10500112	Lip gloss!
10500233	10500673	It's going to be...
10501818	10503139	It's going to be interesting.
10504100	10504961	It's going to be interesting.
10505781	10506082	Cool.
10507243	10508384	Like picking your nose and eating it.
10508424	10509184	That's interesting, too.
10509925	10512047	I wouldn't... I'd rather do a Brazilian wax job.
10512147	10512487	Alright.
10515390	10517872	It's 9.30, we've got to get final thoughts.
10518052	10520133	Final thoughts, Angel, your final thought.
10520153	10524176	Thanks for being here and not filling this show with sexual innuendo like Extover.
10524716	10527418	Why would I... Except that water sports thing, that was hella gross.
10527538	10529159	That was his fault.
10531301	10531981	What's your final thought?
10534863	10535824	My PC must work.
10537224	10538085	Extover, your final thought.
10539606	10541367	Orange Lounge Radio, a week from tomorrow.
10542608	10544029	Extover's Case of the Mondays.
10546454	10547094	You'll have it.
10549235	10550395	I might catch something else.
10550475	10552995	Queer guy's voice for the straight guy's ear.
10554736	10555136	And girls.
10555196	10556296	Loki, your final thought.
10559917	10562737	You should name your show Bad Dude with Sky.
10563837	10565758	Are you a bad enough dude to eat a cheeseburger?
10567118	10568598	I'll just call my show The Guardian Legend.
10568618	10569718	It'd be awesome.
10571719	10573219	My final thought is... The Eggplant Wizard.
10574266	10576707	My final thought is I'm sorry that we didn't get to open up the skyplane again.
10577527	10581048	We ran out of time by talking about us and fucking letting Christopher talk.
10583489	10584169	Just kidding.
10585009	10586470	DarkSakura, your final thought.
10587630	10591571	Reject false icons and remember it's down the road, not across the street, kids.
10591631	10592072	Do it right.
10593632	10594072	That's it.
10594292	10596033	One word of the show to sum everything up.
10596213	10596733	One word.
10597093	10597953	Final word of the show.
10598393	10599414	Angel, I'm going to give it to you.
10599734	10600294	Final word.
10600334	10600714	What is it?
10602155	10602935	Water sports.
10603135	10603355	Wow.
10604918	10608059	And now, here is your fortune cookie message of the day.
10635148	10646393	America, fuck yeah, coming again to save the motherfucking day, yeah.
10646413	10658039	America, fuck yeah, freedom is the only way, yeah.
10658059	10662101	Terrorists, your game is through.
10663471	10670457	Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.
10730350	10730912	End of line.
10731753	10732134	That's it.
10732736	10733177	Show's over.
10733197	10733898	I'm going home.
10734540	10738308	Reconnect to the stream in about 15 seconds for Bomani music and video game music.
10739010	10739752	Thanks for listening!
