35818	36898	We'll talk about that tonight.
37398	45642	Also tonight, one of the biggest wishes the Bomani scene has ever had got granted this week
46397	48078	and I don't think half of you noticed.
48958	52159	So we're going to talk about all that tonight right after this introduction.

91547	93188	Oh, God.
93228	94169	Call me Daddy.

141500	145222	Orange Lounge Radio will not contain any of that in this episode.
145542	146723	Well, isn't that special?
151719	154680	We are live and this is episode number 158.
179150	196831	For this, October the 2nd of 2005, you're tuned in to Orange Lounge Radio, radio that gamers really want, and this is Orange Lounge Radio Live, your home for all the news and discussion on rhythm and music games, as well as the gamer community and the pop culture world.
197270	203472	or plugged in and fully interactive through our website at www.orangeloungeradio.com.
203992	205132	My name is Rob Roberts.
205172	206293	You might know me as Sky.
206393	208773	Joining me, as always, are my awesome co-hosts.
209193	212914	In this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm, Miss DarkSakura.
213935	214595	I've got legs.
215455	216215	You've got legs?
216235	217356	Do you like bread?
218877	220338	Did you say you got legs?
220458	221439	I have legs.
221779	223821	Oh, that's good.
223921	226743	I was listening to some of my Eddie Izzard stuff before I left.
226864	229306	Especially if you're trying to play DDR, legs are a good thing.
230106	230386	No.
230847	232548	There are people without legs who play DDR.
233469	234610	Or at least who were watching them.
234990	236371	How do you play DDR without legs?
236411	239414	There was a guy who played with the crutches and did a free show.
239574	243277	Oh, yeah, that infamous video on the intranet.
245459	245819	All right.
246846	250467	Well, also not here tonight, just yet, is Loki.
251328	253408	He's actually running a little bit tardy tonight.
253989	255269	And you know what that means, kids.
255729	259010	FIRED!
259050	259911	He'll be here soon enough.
260271	263232	And actually, we're kind of bummed because we don't have any special guests tonight.
264412	266173	There's us, and we're special enough.
266353	268894	Yeah, it's just the three of us, and of course your calls on the skyplane.
269014	271115	No, we have somebody who's returned to the show.
271255	271995	Oh, goody, who?
272495	272815	Yeah.
275489	279570	I forgot to tell you what I found this week after incessant listener demand.
281451	282191	We dug him up.
283392	283652	Anyway.
286593	287633	So Loki will be here soon enough.
287733	302078	Actually what's kind of sad is that Miklatov, one of our regular guests, was just here not even an hour ago and was going to stay for the show but unfortunately due to some commuting issues had to get back before the show started.
302178	304499	So he says hi and I guess
304864	306125	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
331952	334494	Unfortunately, I'm going to tell you, you may not want to listen tonight.
334835	336656	But honestly, there's some real good stuff.
337377	338138	Just stick with it.
340660	346245	I'm assuming that a lot of people out there who were trying to really stay careful of the spoilers probably...
347000	351322	Have either already unlocked this stuff for themselves by now or just, you know, don't care at this point.
351382	351663	I don't know.
352063	357626	So I just want to warn you guys, we are going to talk about and probably play some music that is unlockable in DDR Extreme 2.
357666	360947	So you guys, it might be a spoiler, but who cares?
361288	362808	The game's been out for several days now.
363929	364509	We can spoil.
364950	367251	If they don't want the spoiler, they can all go see Serenity.
368271	371413	Yeah, we'll talk about... So that it can make the 80 million and we get a sequel.
371693	372874	We'll talk about Serenity, yes.
373877	376658	And we'll talk about other stuff, too.
376718	378838	I want to talk about that big, big secret.
379378	380438	Well, it's not really a secret.
380798	394461	It's out there, and people have been wanting this in a Bomani game for so, so long, and it's out there, and nobody... I know somebody found it, because people were talking about it, but nobody I know knew about this, really, except Miklatov, who pointed it out to me.
394521	397682	But we will talk about all that after this break, kids.
398422	398622	So...
399775	400155	DDR Extreme 2 Music
441438	467214	We drift deeper and life goes on We drift deeper into the sound Traveling somewhere, could be anywhere There's a coldness in the air, but I don't care
543668	546272	Back with another one of those block rockin' beats!
688849	689670	Thanks for watching!
834884	838747	Orange Lounge Radio, Bomani Music, and more.
842849	844891	We're back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
845491	848093	We are in the midst of our October 2nd episode.
848133	849254	Of course, we are live here.
849974	852616	And it is episode number, what, 158?
853336	854017	I'm starting to lose count.
854037	854677	We're getting so high.
854697	855097	We're old.
855257	855918	I know, God.
857099	858220	We have to keep innovating.
858340	860501	We're what, like three and a half years old now?
860741	861662	Yeah, something like that.
861682	864964	We're pretty well potty trained at this point, and we're going to start preschool soon.
865244	867145	Yeah.
867206	869687	We don't have to use the big kids' pants anymore.
869707	871248	That's right, we have like pull-ups.
873029	874870	Mommy, wow, I'm a big kid now.
874890	877112	Occasionally we still do have an accident or two.
879659	884024	All right, in that break you did hear some music from Dance Dance Revolution Extreme 2.
884324	890490	You heard As the Rush Comes, Block Rockin' Beats, Genie in a Bottle, and I Will Survive.
892792	894454	DarkSakura, you didn't really get a chance to.
894474	896156	Now, I know you're eating cake over there.
896356	897197	Let them eat cake.
897758	898979	No one's supposed to know I'm cheating.
899960	900520	Oh, my bad.
901121	901982	Nobody listens to this show.
902022	902362	It's okay.
904642	905363	No, just kidding.
905503	906024	Just kidding.
906064	906645	Tons and tons.
906945	909969	Hundreds upon hundreds of people want to listen to this show.
910950	911791	And a couple do.
912172	916076	And they're in our chat room, www.orangeloungeradio.com.
916157	917358	Click on Interact With Us.
919000	920182	I'm sorry, that's for the Skype line.
920202	920903	Click on Chat.
922244	923566	This is going to be one of those nights tonight.
924202	928066	Click on chat and you can join our chat room and there's a whole bunch of fun people in there.
928626	929647	What are they talking about right now?
930548	933631	I think some comments there on some of the songs.
934131	936393	Except for the Akira Moka one.
937051	938072	We're assuming it's Akira.
938092	940234	We don't really know because the saying Akira... The beat was cool.
941034	943256	I don't see how it couldn't be Akira Yamaoka, honestly.
943276	946579	The beat was cool, although it's like I'm very picky about that song.
946679	947640	And that would have been I Will Survive.
948300	951023	But the Genie in the Bottle one made me feel highly nauseous.
951203	954746	Genie in the Bottle's been a very split down the middle one in the community.
954786	958449	Of course, I've been reading a lot of feedback, not just on our forums over at Orange Lodge Radio, but the more...
959158	959878	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft,
989864	994989	Anyway, now you didn't really get a chance to check out Dance Dance Revolution Extreme 2, did you Jamie?
995009	997471	You haven't really... When I have no life.
998992	999152	No.
1000914	1003076	I did, I ran out and got it on Tuesday.
1003396	1008040	I'm going to wait for Loki to get here because I think he's been playing it too, so I'll wait and share my thoughts with him.
1008121	1014126	But in the meantime, let's go ahead and start off tonight's show as we do every week, playing a little bit of How Was Your Cake?
1014346	1014787	How Was Your Day?
1014807	1015127	How Was Your Day?
1015788	1018349	And we'll start it off with the one and only DarkSakura.
1018589	1021390	The sugar is burning a path down my throat like vodka.
1024131	1026131	I played Nintendogs, lots and lots of puppies.
1027112	1027592	And that's it.
1028792	1029952	I didn't even touch World of Warcraft.
1031153	1034374	Although we did have a very nerdly discussion Friday night after Serenity.
1035254	1036614	Oh my gosh.
1037635	1040256	Because we were starting to talk about games for a little while.
1040296	1040956	We were talking about...
1042578	1043378	God, what were we talking about?
1043398	1045500	Just different DDRs and stuff.
1046061	1048022	And our various MMOs.
1048362	1048723	Oh, yeah.
1049043	1055449	Various MMOs that we've played, like Ragnarok and Final Fantasy XI and World of Warcraft and City of Heroes and all this other stuff.
1056710	1063796	We were talking about all those games, and one of my poor friends who isn't much of a gamer was just kind of sitting there going, blink, blink, blink.
1064216	1066098	And this was also like his birthday dinner, so...
1066843	1071524	I only got onto the Angel discussion and Buffy.
1071804	1079325	Yeah, then you guys started talking about Buffy and Angel all night, and then that was the part where I started going blink, blink, blink, because I'm not much of a Joss Whedon whore.
1079706	1085087	Granted, I did go out and see Serenity, because I was essentially dragged by all my friends who are Joss Whedon whores.
1085927	1086467	But it was cool.
1086667	1087327	I like Serenity.
1087607	1092508	I'm not like OMFG Serenity, like I'm going to make all my LJ icons Serenity-based.
1092668	1094670	I have a Serenity icon, okay?
1094930	1096211	I'm just teasing the general.
1096471	1099374	Like, I just noticed this huge influx this past couple weeks.
1099394	1103317	It's just Serenity whoredom amongst the nerds on my LJ list, which is cool.
1103657	1112264	I mean, God knows I have my nerdy things as well, so I'm not one to judge, but I just noticed that the past two weeks, you know, have been like, Serenity thing's been on overdrive.
1112644	1115146	So I'm not like OMFG over the movie, but it was good.
1115327	1116367	It was cool.
1117689	1119570	I liked the action scenes.
1119610	1120551	It was action-packed.
1122327	1124789	I liked that part at the end.
1125269	1126830	And I liked the black chick with a gun.
1127731	1128291	She was cool.
1129412	1129733	Zoe.
1129793	1131174	Because black chick with guns are cool.
1132054	1132374	They are?
1134476	1136457	Alright, that's my opinion on Serenity.
1137278	1138659	And Rob's movie review.
1139260	1142762	No, we actually have Extra for here, and he's going to give his movie review a little later in the show.
1143303	1145124	And he's actually sitting in Loki's chair.
1145384	1146345	You're our new co-host now.
1147366	1150048	If we fire Loki, you're going to have to step in here.
1150068	1150368	Okay.
1150468	1150648	Okay.
1151152	1153273	I hate Macs and in the groove.
1153313	1153953	There you go.
1154654	1155674	He fits right in.
1155754	1156295	I love it.
1158636	1159236	I have a Mac now.
1159276	1159856	Is that a Mac?
1160177	1160837	I hate you.
1161757	1162678	I have a Mac now.
1163418	1167240	I have an iMac that I named Easy Mac.
1168261	1168901	That's cool.
1170162	1173263	It's the graphite one, so it fits in with my dark personality.
1174724	1175985	Extra, for what games do you play?
1176745	1179186	Do you play the DDR games at all?
1179646	1179666	I...
1181286	1183087	Enjoy watching people play them.
1183248	1184068	I like Pump It Up.
1185529	1191634	No, I do, because as a person who's not very good at DDR, it felt more natural.
1192154	1193976	Pump It Up felt more natural for me.
1195537	1200421	That's interesting, because I think in a lot of ways Pump It Up is actually a harder game, even to pick up and learn.
1200441	1203123	I think DDR is a little more beginner-friendly than Pump It Up.
1203143	1206405	Not to knock Pump It Up, I just don't see it as beginner-friendly.
1207206	1207606	I don't know.
1207726	1209848	I just don't have that...
1210999	1212079	Why is Fiona Apple on Myspace?
1232207	1236070	Thank you for completely derailing our previous topic.
1236330	1236730	That's alright.
1254182	1255923	Hey, come check out our show.
1255963	1258844	And then they like paste a huge ass image of a flyer.
1259245	1260985	This is my sister's MySpace for you guys.
1261005	1263467	Because my sister is like the biggest MySpace whore I know.
1263487	1266888	Okay, my sister has over 1,000 friends on MySpace.
1267048	1267589	I'm not even kidding.
1267609	1269029	She has over 1,000 friends.
1269089	1269410	I have 64.
1271229	1271729	and I have 227.
1272089	1273930	We're not going to go there.
1274250	1279831	And I've posted about 10 entries since I've had my... I don't post any entries.
1279871	1280452	I don't either.
1280512	1281672	I just have my profile.
1281892	1283733	I have my live journal to post entries.
1283753	1286213	And my sexy MySpace emo pics, which reminds me.
1287114	1292335	Last night, me, Extifer, John, and Precious Amanda were all here last night.
1294006	1297508	See, you kind of have the emo pic thing going on, on your MySpace.
1297809	1298809	It's a good emo pic.
1298949	1301151	Every MySpace profile, we're talking about MySpace.
1301211	1303052	That's me holding the camera over my head.
1303192	1306474	See, that's the way to take an emo pic, is take a picture of yourself.
1307455	1312658	So we were actually taking emo pics last night, because I think John was borrowing his parents' digital camera, which is kind of nice.
1313058	1315860	So we were taking pictures of ourselves.
1316200	1319182	We were doing that thing where you take a picture of yourself in the bathroom mirror.
1319662	1323944	and you're like half flexing and you look really like sad, like you're going to cry.
1324645	1328247	Like you just listened to an entire Linkin Park album or something.
1328347	1332189	Like Evanescence, you know, and then you're sad inside.
1332229	1333730	But Evanescence makes me happy.
1335471	1336111	Sarcasm.
1337372	1346797	No, you know, Amanda and I, we were trying to do an emo pic where we were both in the bathroom and she was holding up the camera and taking a picture of us, which is funny because, you know, that way...
1348322	1349743	Why would a person do that?
1349903	1350944	Which makes it funny.
1352105	1352946	I like that one better.
1353406	1356929	I'm waiting to see how my emo pics turn out.
1357009	1358190	But I will put them on my MySpace.
1358491	1362014	And by the way, kids, Orange Lounge Radio has hopped on the MySpace bandwagon.
1362054	1362514	Toot toot!
1363135	1367198	And we've got a club thingy on there.
1367238	1368759	We haven't really done anything with it yet.
1370341	1371182	But it's there.
1371462	1372122	And join it.
1372142	1374524	Because when a lot of people are in the club, then they'll go, Hey!
1375444	1377305	Why are all my friends in this Orange Lounge Radio Club?
1377325	1380186	And then they'll be likely to check out our station and our podcast.
1380487	1381447	And then we get popular.
1381827	1383908	And then we can sell commercials on this program.
1384128	1386490	And we can all quit our day jobs and do Orange Lounge Radio forever.
1386590	1387530	Yay!
1388030	1389511	That means that I can't move.
1392232	1392893	But I'm not going to.
1395714	1396014	All right.
1397055	1398576	So anyway, MySpace.com.
1398636	1401137	I don't even know how to access our club on MySpace.com.
1401157	1403358	I think it's like MySpace.com slash...
1403834	1405594	Clubs slash Orange Lounge Radio or something.
1405854	1407735	Just do a search in the clubs for Orange Lounge Radio.
1408075	1411556	I don't imagine that there's like some other club named Orange Lounge Radio.
1411636	1416677	I'm pretty sure we're the only club named Orange Lounge Radio because I can't think of anybody else that would call themselves Orange Lounge Radio.
1416877	1417937	So look for that.
1419158	1420618	So how was your gaming week, Rob?
1421498	1427380	Well, I'll talk about my gaming week on the podcast, but I'll talk about my regular week now.
1428760	1430060	Okay.
1430080	1430700	Just messing with you.
1432881	1433421	My week was
1434262	1441805	And I barely slept last night at all, and I took a big ol' nap today, so I didn't really do anything on my Sunday, which kinda sucks.
1441825	1442325	Stop laughing.
1442345	1445687	But you didn't do anything with your Sunday?
1446627	1448248	I went to Lions and ate.
1449408	1451129	But you didn't do anything else?
1451409	1452109	This program.
1452550	1453150	Oh, okay.
1455051	1457392	Yeah, but this is nothing noteworthy.
1458372	1460753	I was starting to think that Rob was starting to do stuff like ice cream.
1462179	1462620	Ice cream?
1462960	1463500	We have ice cream?
1463560	1464061	Your sundae.
1465142	1466623	Oh my god, we should totally get ice cream.
1467064	1467785	I know, I totally want ice cream.
1467805	1468185	We should.
1468285	1470187	Except for when Loki gets here, you're our ice cream bitch.
1470207	1472169	You should go get us all Cold Stone.
1473410	1473931	Should I really?
1474611	1475572	That would be awesome!
1475612	1476473	Except I have no money.
1477274	1478555	Oh, I don't either.
1478755	1480337	Just get us a big tub of Ben & Jerry's.
1481938	1483139	A big tub of Ben & Jerry's?
1483180	1483380	Yes.
1483960	1485662	Hey, is my picture, does it look emo?
1485682	1485722	No.
1486581	1487281	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1514025	1515166	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1535856	1540839	Somebody commented today that I look like I've lost weight, and I credit that to the three days of DDR I've been playing this week.
1542320	1542900	I'm just kidding.
1543360	1546502	Not just for that, but I've been playing quite a bit of DDR and other stuff.
1546582	1547283	It doesn't show.
1548083	1548483	Shut up.
1550885	1551145	All right.
1551305	1552106	You're still fat.
1552706	1553186	Shut up.
1553666	1554027	All right.
1554627	1555988	Extifer, why don't you go?
1556048	1556528	How was your week?
1556548	1556988	How was your day?
1558229	1559650	My week was good.
1559830	1564193	I just worked at blah, blah, boring, etc.,
1565612	1567754	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1591900	1592700	Do you feel abandoned?
1592720	1593861	Are you having abandonment issues?
1593881	1594201	I do.
1594441	1598162	I was planning on, you know... That precious Amanda Miklatov had to go.
1598242	1598542	Right.
1598602	1603024	I was planning on hanging out with Miklatov as he was doing the show with you guys.
1603084	1609486	Well, usually when Miklatov is here on the show, he'll drop in and say hi, and then he retires out to the living room because he just doesn't really want to be on the show.
1609786	1614087	And we got a new gay channel here, logo, that I was just watching in the other room.
1614107	1614628	Super!
1614888	1615208	I know.
1615268	1616168	It's super fabulous.
1616788	1618369	And we... They were having a...
1619600	1620121	Is that funny?
1621263	1622665	What are you laughing at over there?
1624487	1625549	Is it the chat room?
1625869	1626029	No.
1626870	1628693	Just the way he's super fabulous.
1628713	1629434	Yeah, I know.
1629474	1630075	He's a big queer.
1631557	1632759	No, I'm not, dude.
1634332	1640934	We went, so I was watching that channel and they have, you know, a lot of super gay programming on it.
1641054	1641974	Well, imagine that.
1642194	1643835	I mean, on the gay channel, what are you going to have?
1643855	1646596	You're going to have... Well, you know, they have Wonderfalls, which isn't totally gay.
1646636	1650917	Madonna documentaries and, I don't know, what else do you show on the gay channel?
1650937	1651637	They don't have Madonna.
1651657	1655418	It was actually, it was a reality show based around this gay...
1655939	1657239	I like sitting here right now.
1687374	1688115	You don't know that?
1688375	1694042	DarkSakura as a straight woman, do you ever look at a guy and go, I bet that guy has some nice balls!
1696645	1697506	Occasionally?
1700069	1702152	I'm more like, I hope he shames those.
1703171	1703571	Yeah.
1703731	1704532	Oh, my God.
1704672	1705093	Oh, my God.
1705193	1705493	Okay.
1705813	1706173	Oh, wow.
1706234	1706634	Look at that.
1706894	1708035	Sometimes Harry is better.
1708155	1708675	Amazing.
1708716	1709076	Look at that.
1709096	1710897	We just lost half our listeners.
1711077	1711618	Good job.
1711718	1713019	Now we're down to one listener.
1713039	1713259	Wow.
1713299	1714340	Good job.
1714520	1717082	You lost half your listeners like last week.
1717262	1718283	We went from two to one.
1718383	1718824	Good job.
1719204	1719564	Good job.
1723347	1723608	Great.
1724468	1727290	Anyway, so that's how my week was and my day.
1729712	1730293	That's good to know.
1730353	1730653	Thank you.
1731394	1731794	No problem.
1731814	1732795	Your week was balls.
1733661	1734562	It was Hairy Balls.
1735422	1736422	Um, and Serenity.
1736543	1737443	Hairy Balls and Serenity.
1740745	1743826	Wow, I'm so glad that this show just instantly went down the toilet.
1743866	1744406	That's great.
1744607	1746067	And Legend of Zaku gets it!
1746467	1746688	What?
1747128	1747988	What did Legend of Zaku say?
1748869	1752691	The in-your-mouth line after... Didn't you see Jay and Silent Bob straight back?
1753391	1755312	I did, like, years ago.
1756012	1756813	When it first came out.
1758994	1759094	Ah...
1760790	1762111	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft
1782618	1783619	Dance Dance Revolution Xtreme
1804286	1808509	In this break we're going to hear some more music from DDR Extreme 2.
1809009	1814813	We're going to hear Injection of Love, but this is the version of Injection of Love that has the vocals not in it.
1815113	1817515	So see if you like this version.
1817535	1822058	It's a little bit different there because they actually stripped out Sana's vocals because...
1822638	1826699	Controversially, Sana says, fuck me, in one part of the song, where she says, fuck me.
1827079	1832501	Although, some people are saying, no, she doesn't say, fuck me, she's actually saying, suck me, or something else.
1832521	1833541	She totally says, fuck me.
1833561	1838082	She totally says, fuck me, and even if she's not trying to say, fuck me, she says, fuck me.
1838402	1841383	So, I don't know if the lyrics, in fact, let me see, hold on.
1841563	1843143	I have no problem with those words.
1843163	1844564	God damn it, y'all got me on a tangent.
1846884	1849945	Let me pull this up real fast here, because I have to prove something to you people.
1850583	1859452	So for those of you guys that have never heard Injection of Love, even though we've actually played this quite a bit on our show before this was ever in DDR Extreme USA, here's a little piece of Injection of Love.
1859873	1862255	And you tell me if this doesn't sound like fuck.
1871405	1873327	A little bit after this part, let me fast forward a little bit here.
1883990	1885471	She totally said fuck me right there.
1885651	1885951	Come on.
1885971	1887612	She totally said fuck me.
1887652	1888973	It's called injection of love.
1890274	1891475	Of course she said fuck me.
1892376	1894397	Isn't that giving your injection of love?
1894697	1896719	I'm gonna inject you with my meat rod.
1897379	1898220	No, my love.
1898540	1899000	My love rod.
1899040	1900641	In other words, my cock.
1903123	1906105	And in some weird porn way, my balls too.
1908379	1908659	All right.
1909680	1917103	So, I understand if you guys, I don't know, you probably went on some website and looked up the official lyrics or something, and maybe it's not fuck.
1917583	1921345	But let's face it, if it's not supposed to be fuck, she did a pretty bad job.
1922326	1923867	She did a Freudian slip.
1924107	1925727	She was thinking about fucking when she sang it.
1926168	1927208	And so she said, fuck me.
1928189	1928789	There, so.
1929889	1931050	What does fuck mean?
1931830	1933171	Because, get it?
1933211	1934212	She doesn't say fuck right?
1934252	1935152	She says fuck.
1935192	1936873	Actually, to me it sounds more like fook me.
1937836	1940197	Like Fook Me and Fook You from... forget it.
1940457	1941257	Yes, I do.
1942397	1943178	It just wasn't funny.
1943198	1947699	So needless to say, they had to strip out the vocals because, you know, they weren't going to do that.
1948519	1961703	Well, I'm assuming, anyway, that that's why they stripped out the vocals is that, you know, because it sounds like fuck in the song, although in Dance Dance Revolution Extreme, they let a little fuck slip by and the song highs off you.
1961723	1962783	But it's so hard to catch.
1963343	1966544	And that's even more controversial as to whether they're really saying...
1966923	1968583	Fuckin' You Up is the lyric.
1970044	1971144	Plus, I don't know if you know this.
1971484	1978285	I used to think that in... What was that one that was in Beatmania?
1979386	1980886	God, now I can't remember what it was.
1981546	1984507	I always thought that they used to say Often Kissed by a Boy Band Fucker.
1986167	1988527	Oh.
1988768	1990208	Often kissed by a boy band fucker.
1990428	1991748	Often kissed by a boy band fucker.
1991788	1992908	Yeah, that song.
1992968	1993969	I forgot what the song was.
1994409	1995029	Wonderland.
1996937	1997437	That was it.
1997618	1997818	Yeah.
1998378	2001200	That was in one of the earlier USDDRs as well as like, what, third mix?
2001240	2001801	Like way back when?
2002141	2002601	Okay, anyway.
2003362	2009827	I swear we're going to get to the song, but I just wanted to get that out there about, you know, word censorship and all that stuff.
2009867	2011048	So, here we go.
2012449	2017293	Starting off this break, the instrumental version, or as they're calling it, the Hina mix of Injection of Love.
2017333	2021736	And after this, we're going to hear some Inside Your Heart, Make a Difference, and My My My.
2021756	2022457	We'll be back after this.
2129065	2130327	Um, so, thanks
2238351	2265145	For your dreams, for your heart For your dreams, for your heart For your dreams, for your heart When a world feels so lost in itself And you feel the life is not so easy for you and me Don't forget that you're not by yourself For together we can make this world better place Give it a chance
2271123	2272804	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2301139	2302220	Thank you for watching!
2446405	2456567	We're back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
2456587	2465369	Hope you enjoyed that break of more EX2 music, including Injection of Love, Inside Your Heart, Make a Difference, and My My My.
2474764	2480446	As a reminder, tonight's show is filled with Dance Dance Revolution Extreme 2 spoilers.
2481046	2490768	And if you are afraid of hearing something that might spoil Dance Dance Revolution Extreme 2 for you, let me remind you, Dance Dance Revolution Extreme 2 is not a movie or a story.
2490808	2491709	There is nothing to spoil.
2493989	2495610	Oh no, we told you a song is in the game.
2495650	2497010	You still have to work to unlock it.
2498888	2510334	That's one of those things I kind of don't get, quote unquote, on DDR Freak right now, get, putting quotes, is that everybody in the Extreme 2 thread is, even I had to do this myself because I feared the angry mob if I didn't.
2510594	2521699	They were, you know, putting all the spoilers in hidden, like you have to highlight with your mouse type text because, you know, they don't want, you know, people are not wanting the game to be spoiled.
2522039	2525781	But I'm thinking anybody with common sense would think if I don't want to spoil this game,
2526661	2533706	I probably shouldn't go on a discussion forum where people are talking about how much they've been playing it and how great the game is and all the songs they've been getting.
2533766	2537908	So I'm not sure I get the point of why we're being so insensitive about spoilers.
2538389	2539569	So, whatever.
2542131	2547234	Maybe somebody will call up and yell at me for spoiling Dance Dance Revolution Extreme 2, but you know what?
2548675	2549156	I warned you.
2550236	2550636	We all did.
2551937	2552658	Well, Loki's here.
2552778	2554499	He's back here.
2554912	2556132	Yeah, I'm good.
2556272	2556632	Fired!
2556912	2557353	No, I'm just kidding.
2557373	2557913	I'm not fired.
2557933	2560473	I had top secret work to be working on.
2560493	2560653	I know.
2561173	2563434	And that's going to be... And I have to get a sandwich also.
2563654	2564394	All right, that's fine.
2565454	2567635	You're allowed to be late once in a while, but don't let it happen again.
2567655	2569855	So how are you doing?
2569875	2570255	How was your week?
2570275	2570615	How was your day?
2571375	2572276	My week was okay.
2572576	2582738	Today was kind of weird because Nelly decided, you know, instead of watching the Food Network today, she wanted to watch TLC, which they were playing...
2584179	2588120	It's like a whole lineup of medical procedures that could go wrong.
2588160	2591501	Like, for example, they had plastic surgery gone wrong.
2591861	2596842	Then they had another one that was when medical instruments get left behind.
2596942	2600303	You know, a whole series of people... Oh, look, we left a sponge in you.
2600463	2603044	Oh, look, there's scissors in you.
2603264	2605184	I'm sorry, but we've replaced your heart with a baked potato.
2605304	2606905	You have five seconds to live.
2606945	2607285	Exactly.
2607365	2607905	Oh, sure.
2608145	2611006	It was just like, you know, I didn't need to be watching that stuff, so...
2612789	2614690	But other than that, no, really not too much going on.
2615090	2618432	Except, I don't know, I'm just getting some more games to sell back.
2618972	2619252	Right on.
2619732	2622594	So, I'm clearing out, you know, my excess crap.
2623074	2624995	Okay, cool.
2625215	2626275	What else was I going to ask you about?
2627256	2630137	Oh, actually, I wanted to tell the listeners about this before the break.
2631257	2633078	You missed a little bit of show, obviously, Loki.
2633518	2636520	Luckily, you missed the conversation on balls, because extra for...
2637250	2638131	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2665802	2667723	Sorry, I don't take note of everybody's gender sometimes.
2667943	2676745	This person actually sent me a picture of the 2DX Red booklet that actually shows the lyrics here to Injection of Love.
2676785	2684548	And sure enough, something something in Japanese, touch me, something something lick me, something something stroke me.
2685368	2687869	She's supposed to be saying stroke me.
2688429	2691190	Okay, so keeping that in mind, here we go again.
2691230	2694491	I'm going to play you the vocal version of Injection of Love, that little piece here.
2694891	2695531	You tell me
2696115	2697656	Fuck or stroke?
2698056	2698817	You be the judge.
2711867	2717010	That's clearly an F. That is clearly an F. That is not stroke me.
2717050	2719032	Fuck me does not sound like stroke me.
2719292	2722314	Unless she has some weird fucking accent, that's all I gotta say.
2722374	2724436	If she pronounces her S's like F's.
2725117	2727018	Like, we're going to go club some baby feels?
2727798	2730279	Or we're going to... I don't... Yeah, it doesn't work.
2730519	2730979	I'm sorry.
2731059	2732299	I don't care what the lyric book says.
2732599	2733419	Thank you for sharing.
2733499	2735080	The restaurant is down the feet.
2735740	2738941	I don't know.
2740722	2742682	I do appreciate you sharing the lyric book, though.
2742722	2744743	At least I know... Maybe she was drunk.
2744883	2746323	Oh, Sana.
2746363	2746723	Sana.
2747023	2751445	Because I remember when I was drunk at Dave & Buster's and I called my food a chili feet steak.
2755836	2756116	All right.
2756576	2757637	It was a Philly cheesesteak.
2758937	2763679	MPQ in chatroom says, Akira Yamaoka said stroke, but Sana said fuck.
2763799	2764700	Discussion over.
2765220	2766040	I can agree with that.
2766741	2768582	Sana butchered the lyrics to Injection of Love.
2768962	2770502	It makes for a good Bimani drama story.
2771503	2773204	And then, of course, naturally, that's followed up.
2773244	2776925	Leave this to our chatroom with Sakurina saying, Akira Yamaoka must have big balls.
2781987	2782928	You guys are so immature.
2783328	2783608	All right.
2784068	2784388	Anyway.
2785049	2785449	Balls!
2786246	2786506	Shut up.
2787067	2788507	I know you're talking about the drink, right?
2789228	2789528	Alright.
2789688	2790108	Yeah.
2791189	2791549	So anyways.
2791569	2791989	Balls.
2792129	2792330	Yeah.
2792690	2795231	I want to talk about, um, I want to talk about Pump It Up.
2795612	2796652	I want to talk about one more thing, too.
2796852	2797012	No.
2797152	2798153	I want to talk about Pump It Up first.
2798213	2799134	Alright, what do you want to talk about?
2799534	2799754	Okay.
2800074	2804177	So, this is the first time I got, well, yesterday I got a sandwich at Rayleigh's.
2804617	2805017	That was okay.
2806058	2807639	Today I got a sandwich in there.
2807659	2808599	What kind of turkey would you want?
2808819	2811321	I'm like, I thought there was only one kind of turkey, you know?
2811821	2812401	The bird turkey.
2812922	2813262	But, um.
2814352	2817354	So I am all, I just want that one, because it looked like the turkey I normally get.
2817434	2818675	Well, this is salsa turkey.
2819896	2823458	Now, I don't know what the difference is, but it sort of tastes like it was dipped in salsa.
2823518	2824359	It's a Mexican turkey?
2824939	2825440	I guess.
2825540	2827041	I didn't know there were Mexican turkeys.
2827061	2830123	Is there a Lombada turkey and a... More importantly, is it tasty?
2830183	2830723	Foxtrot?
2830983	2832344	It tastes like salsa, partially.
2833525	2834045	Imagine that.
2834065	2835546	That doesn't sound yummy.
2835987	2836487	Anyways, go ahead.
2837293	2838374	Pump It Up Step Chart Editor
2859561	2876935	It's something that you download on Xbox Live, and when I say download, it's actually very similar to the way the characters in Ultramix 2 were unlocked, where you're basically downloading a code or something that unlocks it inside the game, because it's only a five block file, and I have a hard time believing that a step editor would fit in five blocks of data.
2877436	2882380	So, you download this thing, and then you suddenly have a step editor available to you in Pump It Up.
2882720	2883561	No big deal, right?
2883601	2885201	It just puts it up there on the level with DDR.
2885242	2886962	You can create your own steps to songs.
2887363	2894527	And in fact, the editor in Pump It Up is a hell of a lot like the DDR editor, but, you know, with pump arrows.
2895647	2900730	But here's the really interesting thing that I think might have slipped through the cracks and some people didn't notice.
2901170	2909695	Not only can you edit the steps to songs in Pump It Up, but you can create brand new step files to songs loaded on your Xbox hard drive.
2910474	2915952	custom soundtrack feature to create your own arrows to songs that you rip to your hard drive.
2916730	2926818	So finally, we have this game out there that allows you to create steps to your own music, which is something people have been wanting in DDR for a long time.
2927318	2929800	Although, licensing issues, of course, make that a nightmare.
2930140	2934663	Now, obviously, you can't really take these files and send them over the internet to other people.
2935044	2938446	I imagine there must be a way to do it using an Xbox memory card, maybe?
2938767	2940268	I don't know enough about Xbox...
2940999	2952126	Memory to know if you can transfer, maybe one of our listeners knows, to know if you can transfer a soundtrack, quote unquote, something you rip on the CD, to take something that you rip on the soundtrack to a memory card.
2952827	2957870	Obviously, you could take the step file and put it on your memory card, but I don't know if you could take soundtracks and put it on the memory card.
2958570	2965315	So, hypothetically, if you could do that, put the soundtrack on the memory card and your step file on the memory card, you could essentially...
2966187	2968188	Give these to your friends via the memory card.
2968448	2972509	And here's the other cool thing about Pump It Up, putting your own songs, your own step files.
2973669	2979451	It has this preloaded background movie, so your song even has its own background movie, which is kind of cool.
2979751	2984372	So it's just a generic thing with one of those rotating cubes and lights.
2984492	2986333	Is it with the boobies?
2986833	2988453	It's not the booby law, unfortunately.
2988493	2989214	It's not the booby law.
2990494	2990714	But...
2992782	2994883	Somehow a lot of people didn't notice this.
2995164	3006350	It was actually announced on the official Pump It Up website that this actually came out on the 29th and Miklatov and I were just randomly surfing the internet this morning and he was like, wait a minute, did you realize that they put this out there?
3006670	3010512	So we hooked up Xbox Live and sure enough, we just went on and downloaded it.
3010812	3015275	So if you own Pump It Up Exceed for Xbox, I don't think this exists in the PS2 version.
3015315	3017196	This only exists in the Xbox version as far as I know.
3017996	3018436	Check it out.
3018456	3021398	Well, obviously it wouldn't matter because PS2 doesn't allow you to have custom soundtracks
3022078	3022539	Check it out.
3023480	3025101	Rip your own music to the Xbox hard drive.
3025141	3026923	It's very easy to do within the Xbox.
3027603	3035350	In fact, what I did, I burned a CD from iTunes and just ripped it on my Xbox.
3035610	3036831	So I have like a mix of music.
3037092	3040354	But I understand that not all Xboxes will read burned CDs.
3040374	3043297	Because from what Mikulatov was telling me, his Xbox won't read burned CDs.
3043317	3043837	Ours won't either.
3044258	3044778	That's weird.
3044838	3045259	Mine will.
3045319	3047861	It also depends on the quality of the CD that you use.
3048041	3048321	Maybe.
3049549	3058491	He's theorizing this because I have the Halo Xbox that maybe somehow the drive in mine is different and it allows it to read the burned disc.
3058591	3058951	I don't know.
3059291	3060531	But that's one thing.
3060851	3067612	So before you try that, realize that your Xbox may not read the burned thing and rip it to the custom soundtrack.
3067672	3074673	But I'm hoping you still have some legitimate CDs in your collection out there, boys and girls, so you can certainly rip those.
3075134	3075294	So...
3078647	3080048	Very, very interesting.
3082470	3088654	So I think a lot of people didn't really realize that because I don't think a lot of people are following what's going on in the Pump It Up scene.
3089094	3091416	But that's what we're here at Orange Lounge Radio to do.
3091536	3092577	So have fun with that.
3092797	3095699	Go dig up your copy of Pump It Up and have fun making your own steps there.
3096740	3097420	Should be interesting.
3101443	3108108	Oh, somebody in the chat room is actually telling me, Ron Chan is actually saying that there are three different types of Xbox Drives.
3109304	3113507	So, possibly, I have one of the ones that will let you read the burned CDs.
3113527	3115008	Of course, the old Xboxes don't do that.
3115308	3115629	I don't know.
3117150	3117370	Anyway.
3118491	3129498	Now, of course, a lot of our chatroom is using this opportunity to say, Andamiro wins, Andamiro effed Konami in the A, Andamiro loves us long time, Andamiro, yay, yay, yay.
3130219	3136183	And, of course, I realize this is a feature people have been wanting for forever, but did Andamiro serve Konami?
3136503	3138685	Is this going to revolutionize things?
3139813	3141074	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3151601	3153022	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3177412	3178013	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3198235	3202378	But the problem is you have to set the delay as well, and that was a real bitch for us to figure out the delay.
3202678	3211424	Because there was no easy way for us to, like, there was no press the X button when the song starts type thing, so we had to actually calculate in time the delay.
3211804	3214686	So it was kind of a bitch to do, but once we got it, it was pretty cool.
3215566	3221490	But I don't know how many people were going to take the time to do that, just to play their own song.
3221550	3223912	I don't know, maybe I'm underestimating what people want to do out there.
3223932	3227314	There's a whole SimFile community that has to do it the same way, so...
3228348	3231949	Yeah, but the thing about the sim file community is that you can zip those up, send them on the internet very easily.
3232289	3250792	Stepmania practically endorses that, I mean, they don't endorse it, I guess, but they thrive on that type of distribution, basically, is that, you know, you even have, what, the SM zip file, you know, an archive file that's specifically made for Stepmania, which is the way, what, like, FoodMix and stuff was distributed, right?
3250952	3253773	Yeah, it's just a zip file with some other program that runs it.
3253873	3255153	Basically, so...
3256243	3261467	So yeah, it is the same as making a sim file, but at the same time, a sim file is very easy to get out there and share.
3261807	3267251	And let's face it, I think that's what motivates people, is because people want to share what they've done.
3269512	3280980	I think one way that this could be improved upon is for Andomero to set up a database very similar to what Ultramix 2 had, where users can submit their own step files,
3281798	3282919	and then share it with each other.
3282959	3286441	Now, the problem is, of course, you wouldn't be able to share the music because that's all type of copyright laws.
3286881	3298548	But, you know, if you had maybe like, you know, you say, this is track one on the latest garbage album or something, you know, and then assumably if everybody ripped the same track, it would all be the same, right?
3299629	3299989	I don't know.
3300750	3302190	Do you kind of understand what I'm saying?
3302571	3302891	I don't know.
3303071	3307494	Maybe not so feasible, but it's a way to do it legally where you could distribute the sim files.
3308034	3309755	So, go figure.
3313661	3316585	I don't think I'll be really using this feature for anything else.
3316625	3317246	I tried it once.
3317306	3322733	It's cute, but I don't really want to make my own step files to dance to because I'll be able to beat it too easy if I made it.
3323614	3324875	I don't have Pump It Up.
3325697	3326197	You should get it.
3326257	3327519	It's surprisingly good.
3329106	3331227	I got a free game, though, while Dan was in Texas.
3331307	3331727	Oh, what's that?
3332247	3333948	I have Taiko Drum Master.
3334388	3335268	Oh, Taiko Drum Master.
3335288	3335649	How's that?
3336569	3343772	Well, I haven't opened mine yet, but I've played other people's, and I kind of want the Japanese one, just because of the other songs in it.
3344212	3352035	But he picked up the Red Octane drum thing, so I'm going to do a comparison of them so that I can talk about it on the show.
3352435	3352695	Oh, very good.
3352715	3358097	Because I've been hearing from a lot of people that the red octane one is highly inferior to, of course, the official stuff.
3358837	3363938	But then again, that happens with most of the... Right, well, I mean, when they're trying to sell it cheaper, they're going to use cheaper parts.
3364399	3365959	I look at it, it's a cheap knockoff.
3366199	3367720	All their products are cheap knockoffs.
3367800	3370080	At least it wasn't as bad as the Rave Discman.
3371161	3372181	The what?
3372361	3374902	The two triangles that were the 2DX controls.
3374922	3376322	Oh, that.
3380163	3380784	Very interesting.
3381364	3382104	All right, um...
3385106	3389089	Okay, we're going to... I think we're going to open up the Skype line pretty soon here.
3389109	3391811	I don't want to go to another break just yet, so I guess we'll go into the next topic.
3391871	3395494	Let's talk about what's been going on, of course, with DDR Extreme 2.
3395554	3397976	Now, Loki, have you gotten to play Extreme 2 at all?
3398156	3398696	Yeah, I have.
3398897	3405622	We haven't really talked about our thoughts on the game yet, so I'm kind of curious, because I want the listeners to be able to give their feedback when we come back from the next break on the Skype line.
3405942	3407964	So we should share what we think of Extreme 2.
3408044	3409024	So, what do you think?
3409345	3409945	How is Extreme 2?
3410486	3410886	I like it.
3411246	3413188	I just got to play it for like one night, though.
3413208	3414929	I haven't really gotten to play too much of it, but
3415339	3417840	Unlocked, like, quite a few things.
3418040	3419521	Yeah, in the Dance Master mode?
3419741	3421182	Yeah, that's pretty cool.
3421402	3422363	I like the way they're doing that.
3423083	3428926	The hidden steps that are in there, that's kind of a throwback to the old Guitar Freaks, you know, first mix.
3429546	3434129	I wish they'd do that with the rest of the songs, like, instead of just one step, have a bunch of them in there.
3434589	3435249	That'd be kind of neat.
3437330	3442713	And then, just some of the, well, the characters I couldn't give a crap about.
3443191	3446915	I think the fact that you have to buy their other outfits for like $100,000 is retarded.
3447095	3452400	I mean, I'm like, hmm, should I buy one outfit or 20 songs?
3453221	3454042	That's a tough one there.
3454642	3458526	Yeah, the outfits are something I think you save up for and get later on with the points.
3458926	3461789	But I do like the whole shop thing and the way you unlock songs that way.
3462029	3462710	So that way it's like,
3463220	3466221	Well, I don't want to unlock that song, so I'm going to save my points and unlock another one.
3466321	3466821	Exactly.
3466881	3475083	I was pretty much passing up a lot of the stuff that I've had played to death before in other DDR versions, like Air.
3475203	3476163	I didn't bother to buy Air.
3476323	3481304	I already have that in Extreme Japan, so I saved up the money and bought Inside Your Heart instead.
3481484	3483985	So it's kind of interesting that I could choose to unlock things.
3484005	3487546	Yeah, about Inside Your Heart and some of those other ones.
3488406	3489286	Politary can't sing.
3489847	3490967	That's not Politary in that song.
3490987	3491287	Okay.
3491307	3491507	Okay.
3492153	3493794	I know that, but Politary Can't.
3494274	3495936	Which is true.
3496836	3498297	I'm talking about the new songs that she did.
3498317	3498877	Passion and Love?
3499158	3499938	Yeah, Passion and Love.
3500398	3501139	That was crap.
3501519	3507783	I was like, oh wow, everything that happened with Orbit Tribe just went down the tubes, just went back to sucking it up.
3509124	3516769	I just was amazed at how much she really sucked on the Longan Midnight Action.
3516789	3517810	I think she's alright on there.
3517970	3519751	I think she's actually pretty good on there.
3519771	3520752	A woman can't hold a key!
3521815	3524156	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3541056	3541516	Xtreme 2 Xtreme 2
3570128	3578173	FYI guys, Sakura and Daikinkai were in the E3 demo of Ultramix 3 and from what I recall, I would have noticed if they changed those banners.
3578493	3580214	They didn't change those banners in Ultramix 3.
3580834	3589479	So unless something changed between E3 and when this game comes out, whatever that poster said is going to be absolutely right where Extreme 2 had their backgrounds changed.
3589927	3591147	and Extreme 3.
3592968	3596868	Extreme 2 had their backgrounds changed and Ultimate 3 did not.
3596888	3599329	Yeah, but the artwork for the backgrounds is going to be the last thing.
3599349	3602810	They're of course going to use whatever they have at the moment for the backgrounds.
3603490	3604570	So who gives a crap?
3604830	3606870	I mean, we're talking like a few pixels here.
3606910	3608031	I mean, who cares?
3608611	3608971	So what?
3609031	3609791	It's translated.
3609851	3610251	Big deal.
3610291	3611511	It's an American game now.
3611631	3615372	But she has Sakura tattooed on her face, which makes no sense now.
3616548	3616768	I know.
3616808	3618670	Well, it's probably not a tattoo.
3618710	3620911	It's probably just the fucking name of the song.
3620931	3623173	If they were going to translate it, they just would have put Cherry.
3625574	3626155	I guess that's true.
3626195	3626935	They could have done worse.
3627275	3629997	They could have just given us the English names of the songs.
3630818	3631338	Could have been worse.
3632079	3636101	You know what is interesting about, speaking of Sakura, I actually haven't gotten to the song yet.
3636121	3638983	I've only been reading fan feedback on DDR Freak.
3639423	3644527	But you notice that the background videos are all totally different and extreme, too.
3644960	3648762	There's no... It looks like they don't use the looping thing anymore.
3648802	3654645	Like, you know how it would go, like, video A for a little bit, and then video B. Go to the spinning Beethovens.
3654745	3656586	Okay, now go to the little plasma-looking thing.
3656626	3657887	They're all their own videos now.
3657907	3660568	Yeah, they're all, like, all full videos now.
3660588	3665031	Some of them are featuring the looping video stuff, but a lot of them feature the backgrounds as well.
3665071	3671214	Like, I noticed in Happy Wedding and in Irresistible Monk, they were different.
3671787	3674329	And what was the other one that really used a lot of their background?
3674349	3677192	Well, like La Copa De Vida has a lot of soccer themes running through it.
3677632	3680014	And the one against all odds is kind of cool.
3680034	3686320	It just has like a very 70s looking art piece with a woman and hair blowing around and stuff.
3686360	3687821	So it's kind of neat.
3688141	3689642	I like how they did that with all the different steps.
3689662	3690683	It's a step in the right direction.
3690743	3691264	Yeah, it's cool.
3691384	3691724	It's cool.
3692124	3697429	It's very interesting that only one song in the whole game has, well, at least that I've gotten to so far, but I haven't heard of any others.
3698167	3708251	One song in the whole game has an actual music video, and that's Get Busy, which is probably one of the most, well, one of my least favorite songs to play in DDR.
3708291	3708931	Let's put it that way.
3709371	3710351	Not a big Get Busy fan.
3711132	3711992	You know what song that is, right?
3712012	3712652	The reggae one?
3712732	3712932	Yeah.
3713612	3714713	Not a big fan of Get Busy.
3716814	3717134	Hmm.
3718254	3719074	Interesting point, though.
3719975	3722375	Reading in our chat room over at OrangeLaunchRadio.com, click on chat.
3722976	3724516	Sakurina says, why did they do that, though?
3724536	3726697	Because Kakumei was left as is.
3727972	3729593	So why did they change this, but not that?
3729973	3730793	I don't know.
3731294	3731794	Interesting thought.
3731814	3732194	Who cares?
3733295	3733815	Who cares?
3733835	3735896	Why are you guys putting this much thought into it?
3736296	3736937	Who cares?
3740438	3743340	My thoughts on the extreme... It's not tattooed on her fucking face!
3743520	3747922	It's just the logo that happens to be on her face.
3748322	3752525	Doesn't mean it's tattooed on her face, because who the hell would tattoo a word on their face?
3752545	3753185	That's retarded.
3754785	3757326	I honestly think that they should have left it as Kanji.
3757986	3769130	Because with any sort of sense of logic would assume that if you're playing a song with a Japanese title and you see Kanji, that typically it's probably going to be the same thing.
3769870	3770770	So, duh!
3771871	3775312	There has to be somebody pretty stupid in their localization department at Konami.
3776749	3777930	Snare has a comment there.
3778491	3781593	Palavstian... I can never pronounce this damn name.
3782014	3785457	Palavstian Dances and Chorus has its own full music video too.
3786458	3794025	I say that's kind of borderline because that's a Konami original and all the video is clips from the game that that song is featured in, which is Oz.
3794645	3795346	And Oz...
3795546	3796126	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3822404	3830491	My thoughts on Xtreme 2, geez, it's very interesting that this is the first mix that they've released that isn't an arcade port, basically.
3831351	3847484	Like, even when you look at Xtreme, the last one they released here in the US, Xtreme, even though they radically changed the interface and everything, I think for a lot of people it was still our version of the port of the Xtreme arcade mix, right?
3847905	3851848	So this is really the first game where there's been no arcade mix to base it off of.
3852711	3866177	So you really, I think, see that evolution from a game that is a translation of an arcade game for the home mixes to a game that is specifically made to be played on a home mix.
3867034	3892063	and I think that's why it centers so strongly around Dance Master Mode because that's a very single player, adventure, conquest type here's a goal, a long term goal to get from point A to point B that you can't really do in an arcade game so I think it's really interesting to kind of see that transition now I think this is really the first true transition that we see from DDR as an arcade series to now DDR as a home series
3892723	3893644	with Dance Master Mode.
3894144	3896885	So, is that a good thing or bad thing for the series?
3896945	3897285	I don't know.
3897385	3906849	I mean, they kept an arcade-like thing in there still by having the free mode, which, you know, basically has the look and feel of a DDR arcade game.
3906869	3909611	But it's just very interesting that now the focus is on Dance Master Mode.
3909871	3912812	Because if you don't play through Dance Master Mode, you're not going to really unlock a lot of songs.
3913172	3920315	So I thought it was very interesting that the only songs that are available at the outset is the licensed songs.
3921676	3921896	So...
3922537	3924117	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3943740	3944280	I like the game.
3944320	3944820	It's cool.
3944840	3945040	It's just...
3966136	3966756	It's just different.
3966796	3968157	It's a different direction for the series.
3968257	3970797	I think I like it, though, as somebody who's a DDR fan.
3971117	3978899	If I was somebody who was buying DDR mixes just to have house parties, though, I'd be kind of ticked off at this mix because there's not a lot to it.
3979019	3983300	If you just buy it to play it once in a while, you know, let's get drunk and play DDR.
3984020	3988301	I'd probably be a little irritated with it because there's not a lot of songs to choose from.
3988721	3991342	But even though I'd say the casual person doesn't like playing
3992240	3992821	All the stuff.
3992841	3994942	I'm sure that they're not that great at DDR.
3995182	4000546	You can play through the mission mode type stuff.
4001787	4005290	It starts off beginner stuff and goes all the way to really hard.
4007151	4007452	There you go.
4007472	4007932	You can get better.
4008479	4009339	Yeah, that's true.
4009419	4011400	The Dance Master Mode is kind of a way for you to get better.
4011480	4015001	It actually reminded me a lot of 2DX.
4015201	4016522	What the hell did they call that in 2DX?
4017042	4017482	Drill Mode?
4017942	4018462	Trial Mode?
4018742	4019042	Drill.
4019182	4019643	Drill Mode.
4019663	4019923	Thank you.
4019943	4021843	Drill Mode in 2DX 6th Style.
4021863	4029906	They had that Drill Mode, and I think it was in 5th Style as well, where it was like play these little sections of songs and meet these certain qualifications.
4030266	4032847	It's kind of like they took Drill Mode and really changed it.
4032887	4035608	And Drill Mode really helped me get better at 2DX.
4035688	4036208	It really did.
4036768	4037729	I like Spider Stomp.
4066383	4067543	I'm sorry, I haven't played it.
4067583	4069104	I wish I could contribute more to that.
4069264	4069724	That's all right.
4070684	4074846	You could maybe borrow my copy later this week or something if you want to check it out.
4074886	4076006	I don't know when I would play it.
4077147	4078627	Spider Stomp is an excellent game.
4078987	4080888	Just there's no music, so it sucks.
4081288	4083509	I have Puyo Puyo to keep me happy on the MAME.
4085089	4088990	But we're discussing, though, buying a DDR machine.
4090271	4093532	Speaking of which, I'm not sure if you saw that I posted...
4094399	4101221	I went and opted to get the correct poppin' music buttons for my poppin' music controller, so they're gonna be arcade-style.
4101621	4102081	Very cool.
4102981	4104202	Can't wait for that to be done.
4105962	4109943	I wanna try to build one for myself, like, so that I can actually play on something other than the dinky pad.
4110143	4110743	Oh, it'd be easy.
4111143	4113944	Just, the buttons are, like, 70 bucks.
4115684	4116184	Cheaper than 400?
4116264	4116745	Yeah.
4117045	4117905	Yeah.
4118545	4119685	You show me how to, I'll do it.
4120285	4120866	There's a fact.
4121266	4121866	I'll email it.
4122226	4122306	Okay.
4122326	4122406	Okay.
4123407	4124108	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4147361	4153626	It's the favorite of Orange Lounge Radio, Paula Terry with Naoki with Passion of Love starting off this set.
4154147	4163275	Also in this break we're going to hear a Palafstian dance and chorus, Seduction, which you guys have been begging me to play since the beginning of the show, so you'll get that, as well as Silence in this break.

4589716	4599387	Okay, we're back here on Orange Launch Radio, and people remind me in the future not to reset the router while we're trying to broadcast so that Loki can get on our wireless network with the PSP.
4600207	4600648	My bad.
4600888	4601489	My bad, kids.
4602310	4611620	So since that was kind of my bad, and I dropped a lot of you guys during the song that everybody in chat was like, OMG, waiting for, here it is again, one more time, Seduction.

4718401	4719722	My bad, people.
4720183	4721303	God, we all make mistakes.
4723145	4725447	Some of us more than others, granted, but we all make mistakes.
4726267	4737536	Anyway, I'm looking at this really cool new thing that Loki was a big part of putting together along with one of our other behind the scenes people, VXJasonXV, and it's very pretty.
4737976	4739938	And I think we're going to announce it tonight on the podcast.
4739978	4743540	I just have to check with Jason and make sure everything's good to go.
4744021	4744181	Yeah.
4744494	4745314	And where's Waldo?
4769456	4772298	and the added bonus, which I picked up last minute.
4772498	4772919	Oh, really?
4772959	4776701	That was the brand new t-shirt, which says, In the Courtroom.
4776901	4778042	Oh, did you get that?
4778402	4782485	I got one for myself and one for the winner.
4782825	4784006	Wow, awesome.
4784026	4787688	So somebody is going to win an In the Courtroom shirt, which is, what is this?
4788068	4790810	It's the In the Groove logo, but it says In the Courtroom.
4790990	4791550	That's beautiful.
4792531	4794192	All right, so check that out.
4795279	4798789	So somebody's going to win the In the Groove thing and the In the Courtroom t-shirt.
4799552	4802681	And also, Miklatov wanted to throw some prizes in as well.
4803251	4804752	SILENTHILL3 STICKERS
4827655	4833776	Mikulatov gave us like 10 stickers, so we're going to just give them all away with other prizes that we give out later on throughout this month.
4833797	4839238	And I'm thinking there will be another contest to go with the announcement that we'll make on the podcast later as well.
4839558	4840038	Super!
4840158	4842279	We got tons of giveaway crap going on.
4842319	4842619	I love it.
4842639	4843739	It's cleaning house.
4843979	4844399	I love it.
4844499	4845339	We're going to give away stuff.
4845359	4846239	Let's give away the ferret.
4846540	4847580	No, no, no.
4847620	4850220	We already gave away a ferret, and there was like three other ones.
4850240	4851401	Oh, did we throw them all away?
4852481	4853681	They're hidden.
4854241	4854601	I don't know.
4854641	4854921	Yeah.
4855082	4855342	Anyways.
4856122	4857062	They're in my butt.
4858018	4867001	Alright, Skype line's open, and people are already hammering us on the Skype line, so if you want to call, head on over to OrangeLaunchRadio.com and click on Interact With Us, and we'll go to our first call.
4867061	4867501	Hello!
4867981	4868841	You're on Orange Launch Radio.
4869521	4871022	Hello, Sephiroth1215 here.
4871142	4873062	Hello, Sephiroth1215, what's on your mind?
4873082	4883525	Basically just extreme, too, but my first thought was, like, why was I playing in the groove over the summer?
4884666	4885346	I don't know, why?
4890379	4894341	Well, I don't know, it just kind of revived the DDR back for me, at least.
4895081	4896962	Except for the arcades, of course, but still.
4897763	4903946	Well, you know, I'm the one out of the three of us that doesn't hate on In the Groove as much.
4904886	4908007	You know, In the Groove for me was exactly like you're kind of referring to here.
4908388	4911549	In the Groove was holding me over between real DDR.
4912169	4913830	It's kind of how I felt about In the Groove.
4913890	4919473	It's kind of like, well, this is, you know, it's like, it's, I can't believe it's not DDR.
4919983	4920864	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4949759	4951861	That they didn't license any good music.
4953462	4961348	And to look at DDR Extreme 2's song list, which is pretty phenomenal, and really sucks the fans' collective cock in every way.
4961688	4967112	I mean, honestly, every fan bitching that was going on on DDR Freak was really granted with this mix.
4967553	4969434	Maybe not everything, but let's face it.
4969878	4973361	The people that were whining and bitching that they never got erotic, they got it.
4973621	4977165	The people that were whining and bitching that they were never going to get cartoon heroes, they got it.
4977405	4981208	The people that were bitching they were never going to get Sakura and Daikin Kai, they got it.
4981589	4983511	Albeit a little bit butchered, but they got it.
4984051	4989096	So this mix really delivered to the fans in every way, I think.
4989776	4990077	I don't know.
4990998	4992859	I'm sorry, it's your call, not my monologue.
4992899	4993700	I keep cutting you off.
4994401	4995722	What are your other thoughts on Xtreme?
4997267	5006760	Um, well, first of all, yeah, I was really pissed about the Injection of Love thing, because it came up randomly, and I was happy, I was excited, I'm like, oh, what's Hina mean?
5006980	5010525	And then, all the lyrics are just gone, which just kind of ruined the song.
5011585	5040119	I like how I think somebody on Freak put it this way is that somebody said imagine you've never heard the 2DX Red version and I realize it's hard to do because you have heard the 2DX Red version but imagine for a minute you haven't heard the 2DX Red version as a standalone song it's not that bad there's been worse songs in DDR although I agree it's a little disappointing for the lyrics to be cut out of the song but you know there's all I can tell you is that there's a reason for everything so there's probably a really good reason why it turned out the way it did
5041055	5051898	Well, if it's a reason for censoring, I think it's poor, because some of the other songs in there, like Get Busy, or even the Erotic song, I mean, I thought they weren't going to censor anything after that, since it got an E10 rating.
5051998	5052738	Think of it this way, though.
5053059	5054679	Maybe it wasn't done for censoring.
5054899	5057620	Everybody's assuming it was done for censoring, but what if it wasn't?
5060081	5064282	We don't really know, so... Just food for thought.
5065270	5069794	Just hoping maybe they'll put in Ultramix 3 or something, since they're probably better on that.
5070014	5076960	Which kind of reminds me, the quest mode in Ultramix 3 is probably going to be similar in some sort to this mission mode.
5077321	5090052	I kind of thought about that too, that I'm wondering if the quest mode in Ultramix 3 is going to be the very central part of the game, such as Dance Master Mode was in this Dance Dance Extreme 2, but...
5090935	5104610	I don't think it will be, because honestly, from what I played at E3, and granted, a lot can change from E3 to the home release, because Ultramix 2 at last year's E3 sucked humongous, hairy, extrovert-loving balls, okay?
5106713	5106933	But...
5108202	5113725	The version that they ended up releasing is probably one of the best DDR mixes that they've ever put out.
5113765	5118247	And in my opinion, I think the song list in Ultramix 2 is better than Extreme 2's.
5118387	5120549	But I realize, you know, not everybody shares the same opinion.
5120889	5122409	But Ultramix 2 is phenomenal when they released it.
5122510	5127112	But Ultramix 3 at E3 this year, I can tell you, really didn't feel that much different from Ultramix 2.
5127392	5131114	It was just Ultramix 2 with new songs thrown in and hey, this new little quest mode.
5131678	5132879	So, I don't know.
5134201	5144493	Well, yeah, I think it was explained before as Quest World's probably going to be like that mode in Virtua Fighter 4 Evolution where you just go around different arcades and fight people.
5146543	5162010	Virtual Fighter 4 Evolution I didn't really play the Virtual Fighter Oh, Jamie's making the gag face I hate Virtual Fighter Sorry, we don't catch the reference because I don't really play a lot of fighting games I thought it was pretty, but I don't like Virtual Fighter What was the last fighting game I really liked?
5162150	5171715	Oh, Capcom vs. SNK 2 Tekken 5 Tekken was okay Anyway, I need to get to some other calls Do you have any other thoughts on DDR Extreme 2?
5173176	5173876	Not really, I think
5174423	5175444	Most people should buy it now.
5175804	5178686	I mean... If you're a fan of DDR, you need to have this game.
5178786	5179126	Period.
5179486	5181288	If you're a fan of music games, you need to have this game.
5181328	5181608	Period.
5181968	5188252	If you're a casual, hey, I like to play DDR when I'm drunk, you're probably not listening to this show, for one.
5188893	5193415	But if that does happen to be you, you may not be so into this mix.
5193455	5202181	I would recommend if you're going to start somewhere, like if you're a brand new, I'm brand new to DDR, I want to start somewhere in the series, I actually think Max 2 is the place to start for me.
5202321	5203262	But I...
5204409	5204729	I don't know.
5205030	5205810	It's a toss-up.
5206071	5206391	It's tough.
5208433	5214399	One other thing I want to ask you, Sephiroth1215, what do you think about the Pump It Up custom soundtrack feature?
5215760	5218503	Um... Alright, I guess it's okay.
5219203	5222767	I mean, it's not something I would probably use, but, I mean...
5224381	5224962	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5244542	5245663	Well, we'll see.
5246083	5255107	I don't see how we can't... If DDR is selling as well as everybody says it is, I say Ultramix or some version of Xbox DDR on the 360 is inevitable.
5255667	5262611	So maybe Konami now has something to dare to achieve in their Xbox series.
5262691	5262971	Who knows?
5263411	5263731	We'll see.
5266713	5268133	Alright, well, we're going to let you go.
5268153	5270775	I'm going to get to another call, but have a good night, and thanks for calling, alright?
5271455	5272035	Alright, you too.
5272055	5272595	Alright, take care.
5273336	5273516	Bye.
5273576	5273856	Bye-bye.
5275711	5277052	Let's go to another call.
5277212	5279834	Is it loud enough in studio for you, DarkSakura, or do I need to turn it up a little bit?
5280034	5281595	I couldn't hear it badly at all.
5281615	5282595	That was probably a little low.
5282615	5283976	Well, let me turn it up a little bit for you, okay?
5284436	5285677	All right, let's go to another call.
5285757	5288859	I'm going to take... I don't think we've heard from this one in a while.
5290060	5291361	Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
5294042	5294543	Hello.
5295223	5296544	Hello, yes, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
5297164	5297925	Hey, this is Dark Knight.
5298085	5299206	Hey, Dark Knight, how you doing?
5299886	5300366	Hello.
5301207	5301487	Hey.
5302708	5303068	Um, what...
5303636	5306577	About the online mode on DDR EX 2.
5307137	5308737	Yeah, we didn't talk a lot about online mode.
5308757	5310438	I haven't played a whole lot of it, but what's up?
5311258	5312038	I tried it.
5312298	5318860	It has a major flaw, and that is you cannot pick your opponent, nor can you pick the song to play against.
5319400	5320440	To play against with them.
5321541	5322941	That's kind of weird.
5323001	5330383	I mean, I guess, yeah, it's kind of one of those things, well, it's DDR's first adventures into the PlayStation Online realm, which...
5331116	5339823	From what I understand, from a player perspective, the Sony online network is just not as good as Xbox Live.
5339943	5342565	I mean, it's just not as set up as well as Xbox Live is.
5343166	5349230	So I'm kind of not surprised that the online features aren't as good, but yeah, that is kind of weird that you can't even pick your song, of all things.
5349791	5351372	Yeah, but I mean, it was okay.
5351392	5352833	As far as gameplay went, it was alright.
5352853	5353894	It was pretty synced up.
5354194	5354435	Really?
5354475	5357197	Yeah, it was pretty synced up when I played my match.
5357297	5357457	It was
5358218	5362581	I'm gonna have to get on there and kick some ass on DDR.
5362821	5364962	Can you tell if people are using a controller or not?
5366323	5367784	Uh, no, you really can't.
5368604	5369265	Excellent.
5370225	5371306	You really can't.
5371406	5372867	I'm a button button master.
5372887	5374488	I'm gonna get on there and kick some butt.
5375028	5379051	I'll play against somebody, and he's playing on heavy, and I killed him.
5379671	5379991	Awesome.
5380031	5380311	See, and...
5381658	5387987	I feel kind of bad for admitting to that, but at the same time, you know they're all playing on controller.
5390049	5399162	Maybe there's one or two guys out there playing on a dance pad on Heavy, and props to you guys for having the guts to do it, but come on, they're all playing on controller.
5400222	5401262	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5422708	5429149	I will still play light and standard songs on a dance pad against someone on a controller because on Xbox you can see what they're using.
5429810	5438312	But if they're using a controller... Whoa, we just had a major net split on IRC, and I think I split from the rest of the chatroom, but hopefully they'll reconnect soon.
5438932	5441252	Anyway, just wanted to give that update.
5442252	5447254	Yeah, I mean, like I said, other than that, the normal mode, yeah, deathmatch mode, pretty good.
5447274	5449234	That way you can open the songs a little more quicker.
5450323	5457870	But at the same time though, it depends on the player's skill on a home pad because right now I'm just working on the B course right now.
5458710	5461332	I ain't even hit the hard levels yet.
5461473	5470420	I've actually been pretty good about sticking to playing Dance Master mode strictly on a dance pad because I want to get back into actively playing DDR.
5470700	5472482	When I say actively, meaning like I'm actually...
5473266	5473787	Step on 150 Arrows
5496294	5500158	but not any of the arrows that are actually in the step chart.
5500359	5504403	If you step on one of the arrows that are actually in the step chart, you lose.
5505084	5511331	I think it's on FAQ, if you step on the down arrows, you will fail.
5512788	5516811	There's another mission like that too where you can't step on any down arrows and it's really hard to do.
5517251	5521113	I tried doing that mission on a dance pad.
5521153	5523695	I could not get 150 notes to register with my feet.
5524355	5527837	I think of one song where you have to intentionally play bad to pass.
5528297	5531079	Yeah, there's a whole bunch of weird stuff there in Dance Master Mode.
5531319	5535782	I was like, do I have to literally get a D to pass a song?
5536242	5537122	Okay, I'll just step off.
5537303	5537983	It's good attack.
5538905	5544830	One other thing I want to ask you, Dark Knight, before we go to another call, what do you think about the Pump It Up thing, the custom soundtrack thing on Pump It Up?
5546191	5550174	That's just like a major, maybe it might be a major code goof, i.e.
5550214	5554898	hot coffee, but hey, to each his own.
5555278	5560502	So are you saying that kids everywhere now can make, you know, Step Files to Porn soundtracks, or...?
5563106	5564487	I don't like where you're going that far.
5564787	5568388	The only thing I can think of though, Xbox Live, you can't upload.
5569609	5570309	Can you?
5571190	5571770	I think.
5572910	5573250	How?
5573530	5574231	I don't know how to do it.
5577372	5580753	You can upload if the game allows it, but Pump It Up doesn't allow it.
5581414	5582094	Ultramix 2 does though.
5582114	5582374	Does?
5582394	5583675	Yeah, Ultramix 2 does.
5588087	5591929	Maybe somebody might get funny outside and maybe find a code for it.
5592009	5592449	You never know.
5592529	5593429	You never know what might happen.
5594930	5614018	If Microsoft really does plan on setting up this big music store for their 360 that's going to compete with iTunes or whatever, which is a big rumor, they're going to set up their own music store to compete with iTunes via the 360, wouldn't that be interesting that not only could you download the song, but then you could also have, hey, you could have this fan step chart in DDR that you download with it.
5614258	5618100	I don't know, that would be kind of cheesy, but I could see it happening, I don't know, might be a way to do it.
5619140	5624923	Alright, anyway, we're going to let you go, see if we can get to another call, but thank you so much for calling in tonight, and have a good one.
5625163	5626864	Alright, later.
5627885	5628825	Alright, let's go to another call.
5629225	5630306	One more, guys, before break.
5631987	5633007	Hello, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.
5633607	5634928	Hey, what's up, it's Ron Chan.
5634988	5636469	Hello, Ron Chan, what's on your mind?
5637049	5638190	Hey, what's up?
5638790	5642812	Hey, not too much, just, you know, been playing the hell out of Extreme 2, how about you?
5643703	5644964	I've been playing the older mixes.
5645004	5648325	As soon as I get a job, I'll pick up Xtreme 2 and have fun with that.
5649186	5650567	Okay, so you're still on the older mixes.
5650587	5651067	That's alright.
5651427	5653908	I'm following what's going on.
5653968	5656690	Everybody's bitching this song.
5656890	5661452	Look, if you want this song that badly, buy the import or shut the fuck up.
5662493	5663433	Yeah, I don't see...
5666005	5668467	People are always going to find something to complain about.
5668507	5669448	That's just inevitable.
5669828	5672090	But this mix is pretty solid, honestly.
5672951	5675193	Overall, you can't make people happy.
5675213	5675793	That's all it is.
5677415	5677775	That's true.
5678916	5681779	But let's take a little step from DDL.
5681859	5683260	Let's do a little para para.
5683700	5687503	In case you haven't heard, I went to the Yoko Ishida concert in New York City today.
5688424	5689185	Ah, how was that?
5689905	5691006	It was awesome.
5691106	5693468	I'm posting pictures from the concert.
5693548	5695349	It was a free concert at the Manhattan Mall.
5695770	5701394	It took about 100 pictures, and if you go through the pictures, you'll see a lot of people up there power-powering as well.
5701894	5703375	Oh, that is so gay.
5703576	5704156	No, that's cool.
5704196	5704716	No, it's great.
5705417	5708259	I didn't power-power because I was too busy taking pictures and stuff.
5709920	5714644	I had fun, but one thing that always pisses me off is the fact that when they don't have any type of
5715387	5716928	Anime or Video Game Gathering, whatever.
5717088	5720029	You have that one fanboy that pisses you off.
5720189	5723551	You just want to strangle him and your friends are like, no, don't.
5723871	5724551	It's not worth it.
5725491	5727652	I'm looking at some of these pictures very randomly on the site.
5727692	5728333	Oh, don't they look cute?
5728373	5729733	You were up near the front, weren't you?
5730474	5731354	Yeah.
5731434	5741759	If you look at this one picture I'm about to post, this is when I got my Powerpuff Mix CDs signed and stuff like that.
5741839	5742599	All right, go you.
5743835	5748897	and the one before that, my friend Aaron, we pushed him onto the stage so he could do Power Power as well.
5749637	5750677	How many people were at this thing?
5752098	5754298	Okay, there was about 40 people downstairs.
5754398	5758700	Now, everybody around the first and second floors is about 100 or so.
5760580	5763381	I mean, it was just so awesome.
5763681	5770624	Words really can't describe per se, but I did find somebody that videotaped it, so I'm trying to get a copy of the footage of the concert.
5770864	5771444	Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
5772390	5773390	Oh yeah, I remember that guy.
5773430	5774950	I met that guy when I was in Jersey.
5775611	5776411	Yeah, Aaron.
5776431	5776931	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
5776951	5777451	The fanboy.
5777591	5778131	Alrighty.
5778571	5778991	Awesome.
5779151	5781352	He looks very happy to be with those three sexy ladies there.
5782272	5782512	Yeah.
5783032	5783552	Awesome.
5784212	5790433	What we did was after we took the pictures, we went back and wished Yoko Ishida a happy birthday because her birthday is this Friday.
5790653	5791133	Oh, right on.
5792073	5800275	And I also found out that supposedly she's going to be on live with Regis and Kathy Lee, no, Regis and Kelly doing Power Power this Friday.
5800415	5800855	No way.
5801423	5802325	That's going to be awesome.
5802345	5804308	Who needs to take that?
5804508	5805610	That's what I've heard.
5805851	5812842	Big props to Ranchan, by the way, because that's the first time in about five years where I said, no way, and then I got the response, way.
5814977	5816358	I'm so gonna TiVo that I'm so gonna TiVo that too
5834185	5837706	Just like that, there's a comment in the chatroom, somebody needs to TiVo that.
5837826	5838567	I will TiVo it.
5839607	5842728	Or Comcast Ghetto Knockoff TiVo, whatever they call it.
5843208	5847410	You do realize, somebody's going to TiVo it, and it's going to end up on a torrent site somewhere.
5847450	5854752	Good, because we haven't done movie time on Orange Lounge Radio in months, so we need a good thing to skewer, so I'm excited.
5855733	5858394	Speaking of movies, one of my friends saw Serenity.
5858454	5859274	This is what he said.
5859734	5862195	I liked Serenity when it was called Outlaw Star.
5864770	5868833	I've heard people complaining that it's way too similar to certain animes out there.
5869213	5870614	Here comes Extaper the Weed and Whore.
5874657	5874917	What?
5874997	5877519	I just grabbed the mic.
5877699	5880901	I just heard Serenity, so I automatically darted for the mic.
5880961	5882682	Is it a rip-off of popular animes?
5883303	5884964	I have no clue because I don't watch anime.
5885004	5885144	Okay.
5887116	5889900	But if it is, it's really good, and I recommend it.
5889920	5891963	Go out to your nearest theater.
5891983	5892563	Well, I don't know.
5892764	5893385	I guess it happens.
5893405	5894526	What can you say?
5903416	5907217	You know, maybe he was indirectly inspired.
5907277	5908718	Maybe it's a fancy coincidence.
5908778	5909158	I don't know.
5909238	5911779	But, you know, there was the whole show that preceded it.
5911819	5915641	So it's kind of tough to decide that your movie is going to rip it off after the fact.
5916201	5920122	Well, from what I understand, the series ripped off Outlaw Star and Cowboy Bebop.
5920142	5922983	But, hey, everybody steals from somebody.
5923483	5924144	That is true.
5924164	5924824	I agree with that.
5924844	5926625	Imitation is the finest form of flattery, right?
5926645	5927045	Mm-hmm.
5927145	5927585	All right.
5928823	5929364	All right.
5929784	5931546	We're going to go ahead and let you go, Ranchan.
5931706	5933027	Thank you so much for calling in, okay?
5933067	5933427	Peace.
5934368	5935209	Take care, fellas.
5935269	5935829	Peace, y'all.
5935850	5936330	Have a good one.
5937131	5938352	Bye, DarkSakura.
5938732	5940334	She actually had to run out to take a call real quick.
5940354	5941395	She said bye.
5942856	5943196	Later.
5945178	5945418	All right.
5945438	5948721	We're going to go to one more call here since I don't want to get in a cage match with that DarkSakura.
5948761	5952264	So our old buddy Zaku is hammering the line.
5953265	5954286	Yeah, as always.
5954426	5954987	As always.
5955666	5956547	What's on your mind?
5957287	5959048	I know you've got an opinion.
5959088	5961609	If anybody's got an opinion on Xtreme 2, I know you've got one.
5961670	5962190	So what is it?
5962250	5983942	Well, first of all, since I'm too broke to buy me a PS2, thus I don't have the game, but I have been hearing around that it's pretty good that people, especially within the city, there's a lot of city players I heard who are actually playing the game and actually going through the hell of Dance Master mode.
5983962	5984783	Uh-huh.
5985339	5986781	What do you think about Dan's master mode?
5986841	5992608	Is it appropriate for DDR on a home mix or should they have just stuck to the make it look like the arcade?
5993690	5999196	In other words, it only appeases to one type of player, like a hardcore person, like a seasoned DDR player.
6000678	6001279	Dan's Master Mode
6020695	6031984	It depends, I mean, from what I'm hearing, like, certain challenges where you can't step on the original arrows, or you can't step on this particular arrow, which is basically an in-the-group rip-off, if you ask me.
6032084	6033606	Those, well, now, wait a minute.
6033626	6039090	Like, mines, come on, come on, you gotta admit, Konami's trying to play the mine card in this one.
6039110	6042973	But, poison arrows existed in Ultramix before that, and other mission modes, so...
6045835	6046576	Oh, please.
6046796	6052561	Just like when, you know, I could say that In The Groove ripped off the multiple arrow idea from either Pump It Up or DDR Solo.
6052601	6056064	Both of all had multiple arrows, so it's... Yeah, but not more than two.
6056084	6057965	How about more than two at the same time?
6058125	6065071	Actually, DDR Dancing Stage or DDR First Mix, one of the songs that was supposed to be on there, had three arrows at one time.
6066112	6071716	But... Solo... Okay, the step charts for Dropout Maniac on DDR Solo has four.
6071756	6072537	You have to hit four at once.
6073447	6080172	Hmm, alright, anyways, MTV2 had their video mods thing on Friday.
6080233	6081694	Yes, how did that go?
6082514	6086778	I couldn't catch the beginning though, so I can't vouch for what they had for DDR Extreme 2.
6087138	6093143	So, you know, they're going to air it again in about two and a half hours from now, East Coast time.
6094244	6098087	So I'll probably see that beginning part when they had it.
6098627	6101109	What the hell was the DDR reference on this thing?
6103755	6105436	I don't know because I didn't see that.
6105636	6107538	I couldn't catch the beginning of the video.
6107558	6108378	Oh, what good are you?
6108999	6109559	I'm just kidding.
6109699	6117345	As I said, you know, they're going to air it again in like 1.30 tonight, so obviously I'm going to be able to stay up to see it.
6117365	6119026	So I can't vouch for it now.
6119426	6120287	I'll set the TiVo.
6121528	6122068	So we'll see.
6122188	6124229	I wish I had a TiVo.
6126431	6127392	Besides, yeah.
6127552	6130634	Zaku, I want to know your thoughts on the Pump It Up thing, the custom soundtrack.
6131343	6134867	Well, let me... Obviously, this is no surprise.
6135087	6143315	Xbox is pretty much so... You could pretty much sell an Xbox on the whole idea of basically playing games with your own tracks.
6143375	6144777	Except none of them use it.
6145715	6150796	Yes, well, I've seen a lot of, there's some folks I know that actually use it in certain games.
6151637	6155418	But anyways, the whole thing, it's too basic, in other words.
6155658	6160519	Because it's not a robust step editor, in my honest opinion.
6160559	6164920	You need something, obviously, to find the BPM, but also something to calculate the gap.
6165620	6168901	And something to assist you, you know, to take every measure.
6169381	6172342	So that way, you know, your song, so that way you can make your song sync up.
6173391	6175793	And so, you know, it doesn't feel robust.
6177134	6180216	Well, you've got to check out the pump editor, though.
6180276	6185340	It's very similar to a DDR editor, but just with some extra stuff there to support the custom soundtrack.
6186741	6187042	All right.
6189043	6190124	Zaku, I'm hanging up on you now.
6190144	6191185	We've got a cage match to get to.
6192246	6192566	All right.
6192586	6193006	Later, man.
6193026	6193427	Take care.
6193447	6193947	Bye.
6194087	6194708	Thanks for coming.
6196247	6199649	Alright, we're going to get into the Orange Lounge Cage Match here momentarily there.
6200589	6201830	Interesting calls tonight, yeah?
6202910	6203210	Alright.
6205531	6209753	I was trying to think if there's any other things, little pieces of news I wanted to get to.
6209893	6217056	I guess not, so why don't we get into the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match, which I'm so not set up for, by the way.
6218057	6220398	Actually, I need somebody to stretch some time, because I'm so not set up for tonight.
6220418	6224279	The question is, has anyone actually played the Karaoke Revolution party demo yet?
6225200	6225600	I haven't.
6226818	6230500	No, I haven't because I can't find my microphone.
6230600	6231981	Jamie doesn't sing in public.
6232581	6234583	Well, you can play in the privacy of your own home if you so choose.
6237664	6239285	I don't sing outside of my car.
6242387	6244108	I would play it if it had gorillas.
6244949	6247250	Karaoke Revolution Automobile Edition.
6247470	6248731	Singing in your car.
6249997	6278643	karaoke revolution for your cell phone maybe in fact that's what they should have as one of the stages you know you're singing in your car or you're singing in your shower oh yeah cause like how you sing in different locations like you know you're at the country bar and then you're at the super bowl or whatever it's called they should have the first stage that you're singing on the toilet or something they need to have like the toys level where you're in the bathroom at the toys factory from toys singing in the corner
6280037	6280337	Awesome.
6280537	6281318	I love that movie.
6282558	6282898	All right.
6283379	6284259	I'm ready for the cage match.
6284299	6284719	Are you guys?
6285300	6285460	Yeah.
6285660	6286140	Sure.
6286240	6286520	All right.
6286560	6286960	Let's do it.
6287000	6289962	Let's get into tonight's Orange Lounge Radio cage match.
6292315	6297316	The way the cage match works, boys and girls, we're going to put three songs in, and they're going to do battle head-to-head against each other.
6297937	6310080	And you guys will vote for your favorite, and the winning song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's Ramani Music and Video Game Music program, which plays 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, on this station where we're not here.
6310740	6312921	It's your guys' vote that makes or breaks the cage match.
6313281	6316962	The rule for how a song gets put in cage match is
6317796	6319197	We have to want to put it in GageMatch.
6319217	6320177	There's really no other rules.
6320237	6321758	It doesn't have to be a Bomani song.
6321778	6324260	It doesn't have to be a 2005 song.
6324300	6327742	It just has to be something cool that we want to play on the air for you guys.
6328122	6333205	So we're going to start off with last week's winner, of which you're only going to hear a clip of because it was last week's winner.
6333965	6335906	And it's going to be song number one you're going to hear tonight.
6335947	6339188	It's a remix of V from the Diverse Systems collections.
6339228	6339949	What's Diverse Systems?
6339989	6340989	Was this 8?
6341430	6340989	9?
6341450	6346933	9.
6341770	6346933	From Diverse Systems 9, this is last week's winner, Dorisia with V. Enjoy.
6346993	6347093	Enjoy.
6490734	6494396	Song number one in tonight's cage match, V, a little remix there.
6495377	6500420	All right, we're going to get into the rest of the cage match tonight, and we're going to go into song number two, which is Jamie's pick.
6500881	6503102	Jamie, I had a hard time figuring out what your pick was.
6503202	6504763	Would you care to explain it here?
6505644	6510026	I couldn't think of anything because I was busy doing my last bit of illustrator homework.
6510487	6517832	So this is from Team America World Police, the montage song, because I couldn't think of anything else.
6518132	6518452	All right.
6518809	6522390	So this is the montage song from Team America World Police.
6522550	6524011	Also featured in South Park.
6524631	6526472	This is a very random pick, I must say.
6526792	6528852	I couldn't think of anything.
6529853	6530513	Alright, here it is.
6530553	6532294	We're going to go into song number two tonight.
6532794	6535955	It is the montage from Team America World Police.
6555669	6573131	And show us the passage of time, we're gonna need a montage Show like things happening at once, remind everyone of what's going on And with every shot, show a little of who
6587620	6595215	Just a beginner to a pro, you need a montage Even Rocky had a montage
6623752	6624972	Thank you for watching!
6661125	6665569	Song number two in tonight's cage match, Montage from Team America World Police.
6665629	6667610	Definitely a random pick, but let's see.
6667730	6669592	DarkSakura, what did you think of that on a scale of one to ten?
6669912	6670953	Ten, fuck yeah!
6672574	6674156	X to fur on a scale of one to ten?
6675397	6679160	I would give it a nine.
6680320	6680581	Okay.
6681181	6683243	Because it's pretty funny.
6683623	6687046	I've never seen Team America because I don't know.
6687106	6688427	It's not as funny as South Park.
6689848	6695932	I never got into South Park until this year, so if it's that kind of humor, I may like it.
6696252	6697333	But that song was great.
6698774	6700075	Loki, your thoughts?
6701596	6705899	It started off as a 5, but it became a 9 because it gradually got better over time.
6706840	6708201	That's good.
6708281	6709442	Like a montage, yeah, I get it.
6710863	6715947	My thoughts is that, damn, between your song and my song, we're practically handing Loki another victory tonight.
6717977	6719919	Are we going to need a montage for this?
6719939	6721761	Wait until you fucking see what I picked, alright?
6721801	6723623	But anyway... Do I need to go hide?
6723703	6725925	I thought I was bad tonight, but this was pretty bad.
6726967	6728568	Yeah, funny enough, I picked a montage.
6728608	6729509	No, I didn't.
6729809	6730170	That was...
6731195	6731655	Whatever.
6732075	6734756	It's funny, but I don't think people are going to vote for it.
6734816	6735376	I really don't.
6735696	6737776	But it gets a 7 because it is a pretty funny parody.
6738116	6742077	But I think the funnier song in Team America World Police was the Everyone Has AIDS song.
6742617	6750219	I almost picked... Actually, it was a toss-up between the montage, Everyone Has AIDS, and Pearl Harbor Sucks and I Miss You.
6750499	6753959	Even... There's a song called Everyone Has AIDS?
6754079	6756900	Yeah, they're parodying Rent in it.
6757280	6757400	Oh.
6758030	6758490	Abba!
6779997	6786161	This is definitely one of those guilty pleasure things, and there really is no excuse for me liking this song at all.
6786581	6790723	And I apologize in advance, but I'll be damned if this isn't just a damn fun song.
6791204	6797867	So my pick for tonight's Cage Mass is a brand new song by everyone's favorite lesbians on the planet, Tattoo.
6798428	6800289	This is their new single, All About Us.
6990709	6994290	Song number three in tonight's cage match, Tattoo with All About Us.
6995310	6996991	Let's see what you guys thought about that one.
6997671	6998491	DarkSakura.
6999871	6999951	Um...
7003823	7033509	um actually I can't I couldn't hear because I could hear myself too loudly um it was repetitive and it sounded like everything else I've ever heard them do so it gets a 5 extifer it's um not a very good song it is very stupid I don't like them I don't like tattoo I want to get a tattoo but I don't like tattoo and uh but the the guy getting shot is pretty cool
7034537	7035518	But he should have raped her.
7035598	7036079	I'm sorry.
7036179	7040183	He should have raped her because... Scale of 1 to 10 before the angry emo come in.
7040223	7040443	Oh, okay.
7040684	7041304	Well, um, 2.
7043327	7043667	Loki.
7044468	7048072	You know, it would have gotten a higher score with me, but I just didn't really know what the song was about.
7048592	7050394	So, um, it's getting... It's not about them.
7051896	7053137	I thought it... Okay, well.
7053838	7055179	Um, it gets a 7.
7056843	7058784	Wow, Loki actually gave it a higher score than everybody else.
7058804	7059384	I'm kind of surprised.
7059964	7060584	I give that song a 10.
7061184	7062365	Dude, Tattoo is awesome.
7062525	7063025	It's awesome.
7063245	7063965	They're so awesome.
7064025	7066166	And the guy gets shot in the video and blood goes everywhere.
7066226	7066886	It's badass.
7067626	7067926	Alright.
7068827	7069647	She should have been raped.
7070387	7070747	Alright.
7071148	7072388	That's just what Russians do.
7073108	7074509	Alright, song number one.
7074609	7076709	Let's recap the three songs you can vote for tonight.
7076749	7078950	Song number one, Doresia with Vee.
7086843	7089285	Song number two you can vote for tonight, Montage.
7098431	7102454	And song number three you can vote for tonight is Tattoo with All About Us.
7113906	7114326	All right.
7114506	7116647	Yeah, I had to choose the best lyric from the song there.
7116987	7119788	You two weren't singing all about us in it.
7120048	7120529	Yeah, anyway.
7121409	7121829	So there it is.
7121909	7123470	Place vote now, kids.
7123510	7131553	Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote for song number one, song number two, or, if you so choose, song number three.
7132933	7137155	Loki, this is the part of the show where we go over to Loki and ask what's going on in the sim scene.
7137235	7139256	So, Loki, what's going on in the sim scene?
7139496	7139776	Nothing.
7140916	7141856	Not a damn thing, huh?
7142437	7143177	Nothing important.
7144417	7144717	Sorry.
7145918	7147660	Well, actually, I guess one small thing.
7148020	7154565	Someone put up a conceptual artwork for what will be Step Mania 4.
7154725	7156707	Oh, it will be Step Mania 4?
7156827	7157568	Yeah, someday.
7160090	7160790	And it looks cool.
7161671	7164994	Yeah, it looks cool.
7165754	7167056	I don't really know how to describe it.
7167076	7169578	It's just going to be the same damn thing with another skin on it.
7169658	7171499	But it'll be cool.
7172280	7172500	All right.
7175565	7175825	Yeah.
7176888	7177129	Okay.
7177449	7179073	Well, so much for what's going on in The Simpsons, I guess.
7179093	7181620	I did see, though, there was a new music game coming out on the PSP.
7184723	7186264	as much of a music game as Rez was.
7186284	7189065	Didn't we talk about that on a podcast like four weeks ago or something?
7189125	7189625	I heard about it.
7189645	7191386	I haven't seen much more about it.
7191806	7191866	E3?
7192066	7192347	Yeah.
7192567	7194367	No, not E3, but a Tokyo game show.
7194387	7194888	No.
7195068	7196308	The game's called E3.
7196568	7196969	Oh, that's right.
7196989	7197689	That's right.
7197709	7198469	The game's called E3.
7198509	7198969	I remember now.
7199330	7200130	Yeah.
7200150	7202571	Has screenshots come out of this yet or something?
7202611	7207833	No, I watched the Tokyo game special on G4 and they showed... That was one of their focuses.
7207853	7208594	They were showing that game.
7208934	7209534	Looks interesting.
7209554	7213136	It's like a first... It's like a shooter game, but it's not...
7214304	7216006	I thought G4 was Spike TV for kids now
7226312	7241164	Well, they have their moments, but this, they actually had, you know, the two people from X-Play, Kevin Morgan, or Adam Morgan, and then they had that Kevin guy from Attack of the Show.
7241604	7244987	The smartest people on the network to cover Tokyo Game Show.
7245067	7250311	Thank God they, like, said whoever else that they have there that's really retarded.
7250851	7254354	But they got the smart people, and they covered it pretty well, and...
7254773	7260176	They kind of went more in depth with the Nintendo Revolution stuff and just everything.
7260676	7261217	But it looked cool.
7261857	7262297	Sounds cool.
7263018	7265359	Alright, if I could just show Jamie something real quick.
7265419	7267360	I wanted to make sure Jamie got a chance to see this.
7267961	7268501	It's a gun.
7268601	7269842	Yes, it's a gun.
7270102	7272323	This is something we were talking about just a second ago, if you don't mind.
7272343	7274144	I need a gun to keep myself from harm.
7274204	7279007	I realize this is a radio show, but those of you that have seen this music video will know exactly what I'm talking about right here.
7284308	7286270	And here we go, and bam!
7286690	7287371	Cool!
7288151	7288632	Blood!
7290953	7292254	It looks kind of like jelly.
7294596	7295897	Like, it's making me hungry.
7295917	7297318	I need to get something to eat.
7301041	7303102	Alright, does that change your score any?
7303322	7305004	I'm just curious if that would alter your score.
7305184	7305524	Four.
7305884	7306204	Alright.
7306865	7309027	Wait a minute, didn't you give it a higher score before that?
7309807	7311949	Yeah, but now that I've had time to think about the song...
7313744	7314644	It needs a montage.
7315204	7315504	Bitch.
7315945	7316305	Alright.
7317245	7323546	So... Loki?
7323726	7324846	We have to save it, don't we?
7324986	7325846	We have to save that.
7327587	7331067	Fine.
7331247	7331707	Give him a hint.
7332107	7332767	Give him a little hint.
7332787	7333568	You can drop a little hint.
7335828	7338068	We... made a new webpage.
7339589	7339829	Okay.
7340549	7340769	Okay.
7340989	7341309	That's good.
7341389	7341809	That's a good hint.
7343476	7344036	It's new!
7344617	7345858	It's new, exactly.
7347519	7348620	And it's a webpage.
7368065	7368946	You know what I haven't done yet?
7369066	7369286	What?
7369446	7370147	What I need to do?
7370987	7377832	I didn't have time during the week, but I need to pop in the DDR Extreme 2 DVD to find the track list.
7378473	7380334	I think some folks already did that over on DR3.
7381035	7381635	I don't remember them.
7382456	7385538	I think they found it already.
7386419	7389241	Well, it's not... There's nothing really in there, from what I remember.
7389361	7389541	Uh-huh.
7390752	7391954	What was the other thing I didn't want to point out?
7391994	7393517	Did we talk about Downgrader?
7393777	7395179	PSP firmware?
7396041	7396862	No, not yet.
7397423	7399647	I seem like we talked about that on the podcast, didn't we?
7399972	7401812	No, it didn't happen until this week.
7401832	7403353	Oh, the actual downgrade didn't happen.
7403413	7410314	We talked about on the podcast the fact that 2.0 had been exploited, but we hadn't talked about the downgrader yet.
7410354	7413055	So what does this mean for hackers on the PSP?
7413195	7419696	It means if you bought one that happened to be firmware 1.51 or 1.52 or 2.0, you can actually downgrade it back to 1.5.
7425037	7434761	And the way you do that is you run this bit of homebrew code using an exploit in their image, their photo gallery thing.
7435061	7439262	It basically is a buffer overflow which allows you to run your own code.
7439843	7443904	And what that does is the program makes your PSP think it's a version 1.0.
7444785	7447506	So then what you do is then you throw in the version 1.5 update.
7448988	7452791	that came out a while ago for the Japanese, and you run the update.
7452831	7464799	And what'll happen is it'll crash out at the very end because it realizes, hey, wait a second, this isn't, you know, version 1 PSP, but then you just kind of reset it a few times and you're back at version 1.5.
7464999	7473885	Problem is, is because it's only a 99% install, we don't know what kind of repercussions that will have later on.
7474842	7479645	I've heard things from people couldn't get their web browser working again to other stuff.
7479665	7490772	But then again, I don't know if that's just people spreading rumors or what, but people have downgraded, upgraded, downgraded, upgraded, so you can do it, and so you have the best of both worlds.
7491593	7498257	On the other hand, I thought about selling my other PSP to downgrade it, or downgrade one and sell it, just to get some more money.
7498337	7501119	I'm actually going to keep both because I don't know how...
7502426	7510110	obviously they're working on version 2.5 which is going to come out soon so gotta keep one for that stuff and one for the homebrew stuff keeping one at 1.5
7513953	7515114	Dokkan no Naka no Mozart
7544079	7548103	and Hoppin' Choppin' we're going to play and Mario No Carnival.
7548183	7554288	They really need to put the Para Para Dancers with that commercial that they had for Mario in the U.S.
7554329	7554649	commercials.
7554689	7555510	I think that would be great.
7555790	7556150	We'll see.
7556230	7556511	We'll see.
7556811	7562716	We're going to come back after this a break of music from DDR with Mario so you guys can check this out and we'll be back with more Orange Launch Radio.
7563737	7564678	Orange Launch Radio
7630121	7630569	Thanks for watching!
7717131	7718012	Thanks for watching!
7779657	7780438	Thanks for watching!
7823980	7825180	Mario's The Superstar
7893877	7895058	Mario the Superstar
7941904	7942687	and Superstar!
7951946	7960593	Hiho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter V, the letter A, and the number 59.
7966298	7969120	Sup kids, we're back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
7969160	7971402	That was some music from DDR with Mario.
7971522	7975865	Here we go, the Mozart one, Hoppin' Choppin', Carnival, etc.
7975906	7977307	What did you think of DDR with Mario?
7977327	7978808	That's the first time some of you guys are hearing that music.
7979651	7983254	It's incredibly happy and makes me so happy I could puke.
7983454	7986797	Yeah, that made me so happy that I think I pooped my pants because it lost controls in my bowel.
7986897	7988638	I don't need medication anymore.
7989759	7990240	Thank you.
7990540	7991340	Use Effexor?
7991701	7992101	No!
7992982	7994763	Just listen to Mario DDR.
7996364	7998546	I heard Ice Clamor sound effects in there.
7998646	7999106	Yes, you did.
7999707	8001148	The typical Nintendo traits.
8001528	8002129	And, um...
8003576	8005398	Yeah, I know why we don't play that anymore.
8005558	8006278	No, it was cute.
8006378	8007479	I thought some of it was cute.
8007579	8009420	Like, Hoppin' Choppin' was a cute song, I thought.
8009561	8010862	You know what that game needs?
8010942	8011122	What?
8011142	8013503	A lot of seizure-inducing strobing.
8013523	8013944	It should have.
8014244	8019468	You know what's funny is that you'd think I would have heard that music at E3 when I actually got to play DDR with Mario, but I really didn't.
8019728	8024231	But the funny thing is, to put in perspective how difficult DDR with Mario is, I AAA'd the song I played.
8024251	8026433	It's the first time I ever played it.
8028105	8031948	I'm not this, I don't profess to be some type of DDR king, okay?
8032028	8033048	Like, I'm not that great.
8033068	8033409	Yes, you do.
8033869	8034329	I do not.
8035310	8041494	My cousin, Dr. D, does, but I do not profess to be some type of DDR god.
8043015	8045476	Anyway, do you kids want to hear who won tonight's cage match?
8045516	8046157	I bet you do.
8046577	8047158	Why not?
8048378	8050600	Let's hear the results in a montage.
8052321	8056964	Actually, you could probably spell out the results in a V formation.
8059028	8060489	That song gives me such a headache.
8061389	8062210	That's tonight's winner.
8062750	8066252	The other two songs not performing quite as badly as I anticipated, actually.
8066352	8067832	So it was actually kind of close.
8068052	8069633	So I was kind of surprised.
8070514	8071434	Extover, you've got a mic?
8071714	8071894	What?
8072355	8074095	Oh, I was just thinking.
8075936	8077357	Is everybody in the chat room straight?
8077417	8078938	Because V is like for vagina.
8079798	8081599	Like, does everybody just like this song that much?
8081719	8085261	You know, I think just like the real world...
8085748	8109806	There's probably some straight people and some gay people and some I don't know what the hell they are people in our chat room I don't really take the time to ask, you know, I don't go around everybody Let's take a poll I don't want to take a poll No, take a poll, you don't want to take a poll, you're gay I don't care You like taking polls Yeah, I don't want this to turn into ASL chat, okay
8110416	8112736	or ASLS, you know, sexuality or whatever.
8112776	8113077	I don't know.
8113497	8114037	I don't care.
8114337	8115597	I'm here to talk about games.
8115637	8116517	I don't care who's gay.
8118137	8118678	No, no, no.
8118718	8123278	We will know how many of our listeners are gay next week when I put ABBA in.
8123758	8126599	Yeah, also, any of you that voted for Tattoo are obviously gay.
8126639	8126999	No, I'm kidding.
8127059	8127359	I'm kidding.
8127379	8127979	I'm so kidding.
8127999	8128799	That's not true.
8129880	8132320	I know it's not true because I know who voted for Tattoo.
8132380	8133060	I'm just teasing.
8133600	8136881	Just, you know, let me know if you're a porn loving motherfucker.
8136941	8137101	Just...
8137994	8138495	Tell me.
8138795	8139756	You made Roz cry.
8139896	8141017	She just wanted me to say that.
8141798	8142038	Why?
8142719	8143740	Because you made her cry.
8144420	8144561	Why?
8144601	8145021	Why did she cry?
8145061	8145882	The chatroom made her cry.
8146302	8147363	Who's Roz and why did she cry?
8147764	8149665	She's one of my friends from the Gorillas board.
8149906	8150426	Hello, friends.
8150967	8152448	And the chatroom just made her cry.
8152608	8152808	Why?
8152868	8153609	For voting for that one?
8153649	8153809	Yeah.
8155431	8155751	Sorry.
8156352	8156812	It happens.
8156952	8157233	Sorry.
8157253	8159775	I don't know what to tell you.
8159815	8160636	The tribe has spoken.
8161539	8163900	I think she should come in the chat room and bitch everybody out for me.
8163940	8164501	Go for it.
8165421	8170004	Well, this is completely on a tangent, but since, you know, we're not going anywhere right now.
8171484	8174266	You said friends, and that made me think of the Friends game.
8174366	8180289	I got to watch a video of the Friends game, and let me just say, I wouldn't wish the Friends game on my worst enemies.
8180949	8184611	I watched a good eight-minute video of this thing, and I wanted to fall asleep.
8184752	8187573	I didn't even want to play the game after watching the game.
8187633	8189294	It's just that awful.
8190503	8192704	Is this another game that we need to get a copy of and autograph?
8193685	8194445	It is bad.
8194705	8195826	It is really bad.
8196006	8198527	It's Friends, the one with all the trivia.
8198688	8205191	It is narrated by the woman that does Janice on the show, the Fran Drescher wannabe.
8205971	8207392	Hi!
8208233	8214036	And it's completely bland, and it just shows a bunch of clips from the show, and the trivia is just lame.
8215396	8217057	I just want to fall asleep.
8217497	8218418	I can't watch this anymore.
8224465	8225766	Yeah, there's a Friends game.
8225786	8227167	I don't know if you got the memo.
8227307	8229988	Does it have... Wait, this is the TV show Friends, right?
8230228	8230889	Yes, like the TV show.
8230909	8231869	No, it's a video game Friends.
8232850	8232970	Oh.
8233991	8237413	Well, I think that that is stupid.
8244697	8245697	Yeah, okay, we'll get to that.
8245757	8246318	Alright, let's do...
8247366	8252411	We're going to get into a segment that we're trying to make a regular segment on this show.
8253112	8255635	Or irregular, depending on what you have for dinner.
8257937	8261161	And I'm trying to find the background music here.
8261501	8261902	Oh, there we go.
8261942	8262222	Here we go.
8263103	8264264	We're going to... Oh, shit.
8264324	8265065	No, that's the wrong track.
8266906	8267306	Big Boobies No. 1
8295262	8296683	Big Boobies No.
8296703	8317554	2, Big Boobies with Cocks in Them, Blood Spattered Boobies, Boobies and Sunflowers, Boobies for Milking, Boobies in Pee, Mastectomy Leftover Boobies, Hot Hairy Saggy Man Boobies, and then my last, my favorite here, Women in Roller Skates Peeing in Glass Bowls.
8319214	8320035	What the hell?
8321249	8322350	Why did you do that?
8322370	8326692	I'm not gonna, you know, if you're gonna download that shit, I mean, don't blame it on me.
8327212	8330173	Okay, this is from the person that left us with the bleached asshole joke.
8332434	8335195	By the way, um... Did they use something other than bleach?
8335475	8337556	Did I talk about the asshole strips yet?
8338157	8338377	No.
8339177	8340838	Oh, well, you know how you have, like...
8341277	8343959	What about the kind that are supposed to dissolve when you go?
8343979	8344339	I'm disgusted.
8344399	8344939	I am so disgusted.
8344979	8345600	Remember, mint scattles.
8345620	8346280	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
8366514	8368935	Okay, we're going to just get into this here.
8370075	8372276	We're going to get into a new segment here on the show.
8372996	8374737	Well, it's actually a returning segment, really.
8375017	8376217	We're trying to make this a regular segment.
8376557	8379418	It's Extraverse Movie Review, boys and girls.
8383540	8384760	Oh my god, that's gay.
8385360	8386341	Exactly, just like you.
8386881	8390102	So, Extraverse, what movie are you going to review today?
8390122	8390202	Okay.
8391095	8392435	The Long Kiss Goodnight.
8392576	8393736	The Long Kiss Goodnight.
8394096	8395296	This is an old ass movie.
8395316	8396557	Serenity.
8396717	8397437	And Serenity.
8398037	8403259	I've already talked about Serenity, but of course everybody probably knows that I'm a Serenity fan.
8403779	8404940	I'm a Firefly fan.
8404980	8407380	What did you think of Serenity on the second viewing this week?
8407501	8409681	The second viewing was great.
8409861	8412202	I got to see it with a lot of people and they all liked it.
8412262	8415923	I was sitting in the straight guy row, so I was an honorary straight guy.
8416043	8418864	I counted all the girls' boobies and it seems like they all have two.
8419945	8420565	I also...
8421622	8422042	Wait, wait, wait.
8422082	8424644	Does that mean that I was an honorary gay man that night?
8424844	8425064	Yes.
8426044	8431207	Jamie was sitting in the gay man row, which you were sitting in.
8431247	8432928	Yeah, thank you for reminding our listeners.
8433128	8433508	No problem.
8434809	8439332	And I also... Oh, that's so much fun.
8440072	8444414	Anyways, I just wanted to talk about Serenity more.
8444474	8449237	Anyways, so Serenity is great, and then the third time I watched it, which was yesterday...
8450103	8452066	I was enjoying it a lot too.
8452566	8460276	And my sister like hit me in my arm when something really shocking happened in the movie because she really likes Firefly as well.
8460757	8461017	Right.
8461278	8461979	So, but it hurt.
8462159	8463681	So Serenity on the third viewing.
8463781	8464702	Thumbs up, thumbs down.
8464862	8466585	Thumbs fucking up.
8466925	8467246	Alright.
8467586	8468267	Thumbs fucking up.
8468854	8470675	Alright, how about Long Kiss Goodnight?
8470715	8472156	Now, this movie's like 20 years old.
8472236	8472736	How old is this?
8472816	8480020	I loved that movie when I saw it the first time because Geena Davis kicks ass and it's just a cheesy, like, action movie.
8480500	8488545	But, I mean, I saw it for the first time in years with Garrett, who was on the show last week.
8489005	8491126	Right, the Poppin' Music Whore is what we call him on the show.
8491146	8492047	Oh, Poppin' Music Whore.
8492987	8495809	And Poppin' Music Whore and I...
8497173	8498534	Make fun of it quite a bit.
8498634	8500454	I mean, there are so many cheesy lines.
8500935	8507818	There's like this line where this guy goes, where Gina Davis says something like, I'm saving myself to get raped.
8508798	8509938	Like, it's just so random.
8509978	8513740	I'm like, okay, you know, that was, it was fun.
8513820	8515821	It was, you know, it's a fun movie or whatever.
8515841	8520363	It's a little long, but I give it thumbs sideways.
8520842	8521142	All right.
8521242	8521923	For you.
8522243	8527427	Now, lastly, you told me that you were going to be reviewing a TV show tonight because you didn't get to really see a new movie in the theater.
8527447	8528707	You're going to review a TV show tonight.
8528848	8529108	I did?
8529128	8529948	Yeah.
8530088	8530929	Which TV show?
8533371	8534511	Oh, The Will and Grace.
8534692	8537273	I'm glad you prepped for tonight's movie review segment.
8537734	8538374	Will and Grace.
8539555	8542697	I'd never gotten to Will and Grace until this year when I moved to Sacramento.
8543057	8546840	And, like, I think it's pretty damn hilarious.
8547824	8554927	But they had their live show, which, you know, I was hoping for them to mess up more, but they didn't.
8555428	8556828	But it was funny anyway.
8557008	8557929	I had a good time with it.
8558149	8560730	Alright, so thumbs up or thumbs down for Will and Drake?
8561350	8561690	Thumbs up.
8561710	8562911	Thumbs up.
8563791	8563931	Up.
8565292	8566673	This is so boring.
8566753	8567133	Alright.
8567453	8569094	Thank you, Extrofer, for that movie review.
8569114	8569914	Now get off our show.
8569954	8570434	Thank you.
8571034	8571575	Get off our show.
8571855	8572115	Alright.
8575369	8581851	We're going to get into another segment we love to do here on Orange Lounge Radio every single damn week because you know what?
8585612	8586352	You know what?
8587152	8587872	What?
8589133	8590853	We are full of angst.
8591253	8592334	I am full of rage.
8592454	8592934	That's right.
8592994	8596675	So that's why we have to do the FUs of the week every single week.
8596735	8598015	And DarkSakura, what's your excuse?
8598075	8599976	Why do we have to do the FUs of the week every single week?
8601076	8601436	Balls.
8610279	8616361	A big F you goes toward my sinus infection that I'm finally over and the fact that I haven't worked out.
8616781	8620682	An F you goes toward the Adobe company for making Illustrator.
8621783	8622963	I hate vectors.
8623683	8630866	You know you've been doing Illustrator homework for too long when you start seeing real life in terms of vectors?
8632179	8632880	I hate vectors.
8633560	8634501	I hate them, hate them, hate them.
8635201	8637703	And I am posting my homework in my chatroom.
8637743	8639945	I think you're like that one best, which is in a red monotone.
8640245	8641866	It really is looking like shit.
8644505	8650109	I also am mad at people in SUVs.
8650289	8652270	What's that kind of like one, the Escalade?
8652810	8655232	It looks like it's a fake SUV with a truck ass.
8655412	8657413	I don't like the SUVs that look like a box.
8657773	8660655	Someone at Sam's Club last night was double parked in one of them.
8661076	8663217	And I totally made fun of them loudly in the parking lot.
8663397	8664218	Was it a lesbian?
8664638	8666199	No, it was some stupid...
8666957	8675105	I was screaming, hi, I have money, and I have shit for brains and I can't park, and he heard me, and then I drove off.
8675926	8676506	That's awesome.
8676807	8679930	You know, I called a lady a cunt one time, because Rob told me to.
8681311	8682072	Really?
8682132	8687917	He told me to roll down the window, because some lady cut him off in the parking lot, and he goes, that lady's a cunt.
8688118	8690019	Christopher, roll down that window and call her a cunt.
8690220	8691621	Just jokingly, you know, and I'm like,
8692168	8695714	I looked at him and I looked at everybody else in the car and I said, well, okay.
8695794	8698138	I rolled down the window and I said, you're a cunt.
8699440	8702085	And Rob can back me up.
8702285	8703106	That's beautiful.
8703247	8704428	He's not making this shit up.
8704689	8705310	He really isn't.
8706585	8718957	Um, and Legend of Zaku, you get an F you because I've had my Wacom for a very long fucking time, and I still hate that stupid goddamn program because he made us fucking use the pen tool.
8719337	8725483	I could have done the whole thing with the drawing tool, but no, we had to do it with the pen tool.
8725903	8729586	So, don't fucking ever correct me again, you don't have the right.
8733277	8737440	A second FU goes toward Loki's song because it gives me a headache every time I hear it.
8741464	8745807	And an FU to gold detailing on cars that really don't need gold detailing.
8749370	8754294	And also another FU to Legend of Zaku because I was not a math major because it was a waste of my time.
8756816	8759739	And really...
8762156	8766058	Okay, if he says anything more about what I need, I'm fucking kicking you, okay?
8766098	8768320	In fact, I'm going to do it anyway just because I fucking feel like it.
8769480	8770961	You piss me off every time I come here.
8772062	8772942	Stop pissing me off!
8775504	8780306	Um, and, uh, FU goes toward, uh, everything else.
8783988	8785289	Was that it?
8785549	8786090	That was.
8786330	8786670	Is that it?
8787030	8787330	Yeah.
8787410	8787991	Alright, here we go.
8789091	8790132	Next up, Loki.
8790152	8790312	Okay.
8793783	8804645	Okay, um, I've really got, like, one major one that I need to get off my chest, and that is, fuck you the fact that I'm potentially have to go to jury duty on Tuesday.
8804665	8806605	Tell them you're in school.
8807345	8808406	You'll get out of it until December.
8809946	8812686	I just don't want to get, I just want to get out of it, period.
8813066	8815927	So, uh, fuck you that.
8816367	8818347	Tell them you're incredibly racist and homophobic.
8819567	8823028	No, I'll just, I'll wait, because I might not even have to go, and if I do,
8823650	8825171	Um, I'll take care of it.
8825391	8826631	Whatever I need to do, I'll do.
8826951	8829172	So, it's your duty, duty.
8831113	8833794	I just basically made it look like I don't want to be there.
8833894	8836035	So, you know, if I don't want to be there, I don't want to be there.
8836175	8837015	So, whatever.
8838956	8841036	And, um, yeah, pretty much that.
8841377	8846138	And for some reason, um, I'm having problems with certain things.
8846839	8848939	A webpage related that pissed me off.
8849320	8850540	But, um, ah.
8853174	8854114	Yeah, I'm done.
8854234	8855095	That's all I really have.
8860777	8861418	Okay, my turn then.
8869881	8876044	I want to give an F you to me for not getting enough sleep at night throughout the week and on the weekend.
8877345	8880426	I want to give an F you to the fact... Shut the fuck up, Christopher.
8880914	8893525	I'm going to give an F you to the fact that I haven't been eating very well all week, but at least I've kind of... Despite my irregular eating patterns, I've actually managed to lose some weight, so I guess I can't complain too much, except, you know, I don't want to, like, kill my liver or anything.
8895867	8898129	And so an F you to lack of motivation for that.
8898790	8904375	An F you to other drama that I'm going through professionally right now, but I'll be okay.
8904775	8905235	And just...
8907409	8911671	and FU to the fact that I still have work left to do and it's Sunday night and I've got to have it done by tomorrow morning.
8912451	8912992	Sucks.
8913412	8916293	And then I guess that's it.
8916493	8920735	FU to Fandango because it costs like $1.25 to use Fandango.
8920795	8922736	Did you do the Fandango with your credit card?
8923036	8923376	I did.
8924597	8925537	Fandango.
8925577	8926137	Fandango.
8926217	8926898	Hobocamp.
8926958	8927958	Hobocamp.
8928358	8931520	And come to find out that Serenity wasn't even that crowded.
8931580	8933421	Like I could have just walked right in and got tickets.
8933761	8934061	I thought...
8934889	8937311	Because of all the hype on LJ, I thought that theater was going to be packed.
8937972	8945538	Actually, I'm sure that the earlier ones were, but I still think it's funny that I woke up late and then made it down the freeway in 15 minutes.
8946198	8948120	Alright, that was crazy.
8949341	8950321	Things I do for fandom.
8950782	8953844	Alright, let's get to Extover's FUs.
8955545	8959008	Um, FU to people with unnecessary drama.
8960229	8961290	You know, um...
8961846	8962967	I'm so indifferent to you.
8963247	8963787	I don't care.
8964228	8966009	Don't bring it and put it in my face.
8966889	8967169	You know?
8968890	8974174	But otherwise, a big old fuck you in a good way to everybody I like.
8978877	8979937	Because it feels good.
8981258	8981659	Is that it?
8982219	8984300	A big old anal thrust to everyone.
8984480	8985481	Alright, you're done.
8988643	8989804	Let's move on to the chatroom, shall we?
8991840	8995361	DarkKnight says, F you to gas prices, work, and studying for tests.
8997841	9003503	DDArcoholic says, information for me that wasn't an F you.
9003843	9007044	Tomokun says, fuck not getting my para para para machine.
9007524	9009804	Fuck my cold and fuck my bad ram.
9011785	9012605	That sounded dirty.
9013553	9017196	Sakarina says fuck Life 365 for making me miss the first quarter of the show.
9017657	9020459	Fuck that guy who's been stealing that 12 year old I find cute.
9020820	9023302	Fuck Illustrator because it makes DarkSakura angry.
9023682	9027866	And fuck Tomokun in a friendly way for interrupting my bisexual erotica reading session.
9028407	9031810	And F you to all USDDR mixes for not having little bitch.
9032230	9034092	Now I need to get Pump It Up and put it in there.
9036016	9039079	MPQ says, F you to guys that pretend to be girls on the internet.
9039359	9041180	I feel like a fucking internet cliche.
9041401	9045344	F you to my router for being a piece of shit and randomly deciding to not let people connect.
9045904	9049667	F you to Injection of Love Hina Mix for reminding me of Love Hina, which I hate.
9051269	9055412	Goggle says, F you to Garden Burger for tasting like meatloaf instead of a burger.
9055552	9056053	I agree.
9056413	9058014	F you to the awful lag I'm getting.
9058374	9060016	It is all about the bokeh burger, honey.
9060857	9063539	Snare, F you to V for still being there.
9064039	9064860	F you to BevMo.
9068037	9070757	for having such great drinks that suck my wallet dry.
9071238	9078479	Another F you to BevMo for having paper bags that have no handles.
9078960	9081880	Jazz says F you to my computer's hard drive completely dying.
9082160	9083641	However, yay for backup drives.
9084081	9086742	Also F you to me getting seasonal winter long cold.
9086882	9088162	I hate my immune system.
9089910	9093253	Illusion says F you to Family Guy for sucking so much recently.
9093594	9095796	All it has become is a bunch of lame illusions.
9095956	9096416	Oh ho ho.
9096957	9097497	I would agree.
9097677	9100640	To older episodes that string along the already thin plot.
9100700	9100981	Lame.
9101101	9102442	I agree 500%.
9102502	9103823	Family Guy sucks this year.
9105385	9106486	Rini says my...
9107319	9113461	Upmost Ultimate Fuck You goes to Dance Master Mode's mission with Boom Boom Dollar KOG G3 on break.
9113881	9117202	Fuck break like all get out because it's the worst modifier ever.
9117603	9122084	This fuck ass mission has literally made Dance Master impossible to complete for me.
9122664	9125445	And everybody, I want you to use fuck ass in a sentence later today.
9125725	9126446	That's the word of the day.
9127246	9132948	And fuck anybody who said the Dynamite Rave heavy on reverse on hard because it wasn't and it still wasn't
9133974	9136215	when you had to not do well on it.
9136916	9140518	And of course, one for Sky because of his hidden bad omen from last week.
9140538	9145881	You guys may or may not remember, I put a hex on Rini last week because I was mad at him about something.
9145901	9146601	I don't remember what now.
9149761	9174760	Brightsta says F you to gas prices, F you to people who smoke, I'd like to sue you for second hand smoking F you to this asshole who's in our dorm and keeps playing his music really loud F you to the campus store for having such high prices for food F you to my router which XP keeps showing as disconnecting my ethernet cable physically And just an FYI as someone who used to smoke, your anger is not going to make them stop any faster
9175832	9198824	By the way, as far as the people in dorm rooms that play their music really loudly, what I used to do is I used to, when the people across the hall would play their rap really loudly, because I hate that type of rap, I would turn on my stereo really loud, which was on top of my chest of drawers, and we had cinder block walls, and would crank Vanessa May to the ultimate loudness on Takata and Fugue in D minor.
9199364	9203386	But you should do that with the organ version, because I guarantee you,
9204295	9207557	It will chase people off, and you will have the entire building to yourself.
9208538	9208958	It works!
9209438	9216283	To the person quitting smoking, um, maybe you should think about, uh, you know, having to fuck ass.
9217944	9219164	Every single time you want to smoke.
9219325	9226169	Acer800 says, A big F you to my trig teacher who is a lazy master student who teaches shit during class.
9226549	9232633	And F you to the lady who was behind me while I was driving and freaking honked at me when there was a cop in front of me and I didn't want to be arrested.
9235652	9242115	LegendOfZaku says, F you to not having a modded slim PS2 and some Bomani games when I should have had them by now.
9242616	9245337	F you to my ever so weak and shitty DDR stamina.
9245817	9251741	F you to me being a bitch about whether or not to compete in freestyle in a major tourney that you probably already know about next Saturday.
9253461	9257544	DarkTetsuya says, F you to Mission C30 and the mission with Dynamite Ravoni.
9258384	9260085	God, you have a lot of angst tonight, chatroom.
9260612	9264573	F you to the fanboy, says Ron Chan, at the Yoko Ishida concert.
9265273	9266973	No one cares you came from Boston.
9267013	9268154	You were loud and rude.
9268234	9269414	Go jump in traffic.
9272415	9274995	I'm going to use that at some point this week during a call.
9275075	9276735	Yeah, tell one of your callers to go jump in traffic.
9278396	9279216	Enjoy your life.
9279556	9280736	We're not going to pay your claim.
9280776	9281916	Go jump in traffic.
9282017	9287378	Color of Sakura says, F you to all the stuff I bought on eBay in the last month, and it's still not being here.
9287618	9289078	F you to the brake modifier in New York.
9289946	9297171	And lastly, GS191 says, F you to my college for putting all my core classes, especially math, online.
9297731	9301213	F you to websites that are taken down without warning and call it redesigning.
9301293	9303875	Yes, I'm looking at you, DDRmaniaX and BomaniStyle.
9304475	9306957	F you to myself for not having any better F yous.
9307457	9307817	Fuck!
9309639	9309979	The end.
9310839	9312300	God, you guys had a lot of angst.
9313101	9314522	You guys are just mean people.
9315422	9316063	Mean people.
9317684	9317904	All right.
9319364	9322226	Remember kids, down the road, not across the street
9348109	9355485	Alright, we're going to get to the rest of the Extreme 2 music I wanted to play tonight.
9355505	9358331	We're going to play Spin Spin Sugar.
9359480	9361302	Tomorrow Tomorrow Tomorrow Tomorrow Tomorrow
9379264	9380564	Ask Orange Lounge when we come back.
9380844	9382465	And you guys had a lot of questions last week.
9382485	9383545	We didn't even get to all of them.
9383605	9385526	So we missed your question last week.
9385566	9388266	Here's your chance to get it answered after we come back.
9388346	9392667	So send a private message to Sky with your question for Ask Orange Lounge.
9393048	9394208	We'll be back after this.
9419868	9421848	Thank you for watching!
9517719	9520062	I'd like to be with you.
9520102	9523044	We've got to take it easy.
9523064	9525907	Capture and pray.
9526047	9528189	I've got so much to show you.
9528349	9530551	I've got so much to show you.
9599299	9626630	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah Mm-hmm, mm-hmm It's a wonderful night, you gotta take it from me It's a wonderful night, come on and break it on down It's a wonderful night, go ahead and release It's a wonderful night, come on and break it on down You know the music's searching, you need a tune-up Soon as they out the gate, they all the wanna hear the corner, uh-huh Boy, that was cool, but now, but then I heard a rumor, uh-huh Your crew was riding for a while
9629895	9631200	Thanks for watching!
9640493	9660659	It's a wonderful night, you gotta take it from me It's a wonderful night, come on and break it on down It's a wonderful night, you gotta shake it from me It's a wonderful night, come on and break it on down Girl, I want it, you got it, your body's like a narcotic The thought is auto-erotic, come on and break it on down Can I get it on credit against your brick house?
9660759	9663200	I'll bet it, take it as far as you let it, come on and break it on down
9671846	9675028	After this song, we'll be having a Let Them Move Marathon.
9702288	9702948	Just kidding.
9703368	9704409	Orange Lounge Radio.
9704489	9706089	Crap-free Bomani Radio.
9706490	9707130	Welcome back, kids.
9707150	9709171	We're about ready to get into Ask Orange Lounge.
9709271	9720076	However, first off, I wanted to point out that we actually have somebody who... There was an FU back there that was about Bomani style and how they're down all the time.
9720176	9725699	Actually, we have somebody who happens to be one of their moderators over at Bomani Style that would like us to clarify...
9726482	9728083	They aren't down for redesigning.
9728143	9730765	The motherboard on their server went kaboom.
9731606	9735489	There's been word, however, that MimaniStyle 7.0 is progressing nicely, however.
9736089	9737931	Just a friendly clarification.
9738211	9741193	I need to also make the announcement, the one that I mentioned to you during the break.
9741353	9741613	Sure.
9742414	9748699	There will not be a Pump Up the Volume this week because of other reasons.
9749659	9755924	But I will be returning the week after with the much-promised, because actually people did ask for it, Blur Marathon event.
9756623	9758305	Ask Gorn's Lounge
9780003	9782964	Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.
9783444	9786666	What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?
9787366	9788526	My question is this.
9788987	9794109	Who will be the first person to use the word fuck ass in their question?
9798470	9801272	MPQ says, what would your ultimate video game be?
9804813	9809595	Golf Land Birthday Party Sniper would be my ultimate video game.
9811411	9813612	DarkSakura, do you have an ultimate video game?
9814252	9814952	The Guardian Legend.
9816272	9821233	Okay, I'm not sure if the question is like... Completely redone for one of the new systems.
9821593	9823534	That would be very sexy.
9823694	9825154	Guardian Legend, the MMORPG.
9827015	9829395	Extifer, what would your ultimate video game be?
9830636	9831396	In the ass.
9832716	9834497	Loki, what would your ultimate video game be?
9834517	9835997	Um...
9837867	9841631	I think they should have a fighting game with every character from all the systems.
9842212	9843273	Just one giant brawl.
9843813	9846256	Call it, like, Console Wars or something like that.
9849339	9849720	All right.
9852243	9854525	Allusion says, What's it all about, Alfie?
9856888	9857969	I don't want... Well...
9859525	9861565	I don't watch crappy Jude Law movies, so I don't know.
9861846	9865426	And I didn't watch the crappy original either, I'm sorry to say, so I don't really know what it's all about.
9865446	9866467	Apparently they weren't crappy.
9866507	9868747	I mean, they got some critical mass, didn't they?
9868767	9870408	Well, the first one I'm sure was critically loved.
9870428	9873668	You say Alfie, I start thinking of, like, in Barbarella, her ship.
9874148	9874469	Alfie.
9874569	9878249	Well, I think of the little creature from Melmac that liked to eat cats.
9878269	9879070	That's Alf!
9879890	9881690	Well, you could call him Alfie as a nickname.
9881710	9884291	No.
9884451	9884571	Ha!
9884811	9885511	I kill me!
9885971	9886591	Damn you people.
9887472	9888792	He, he, ha, ha, ha, ha.
9890441	9894442	Brightsta says, can you pass me the first of the Mario Mix songs we heard?
9894482	9896603	I'd like to add Captain Lou Albano to it.
9897063	9899743	Now, kids, piracy is wrong.
9900344	9901084	Email me off air.
9902864	9907445	However, it did sound an awful lot like, you know, the... Actually, let me get into this.
9907845	9908686	Do the Mario!
9908706	9911126	Swing your arms from side to side.
9911166	9912407	Come on, it's time to go.
9912567	9913447	Do the Mario!
9917008	9917768	Total silence.
9923455	9930937	Socorina says, will my request for that Diverse System remix of Quasar be played before the end of the show?
9932257	9937178	Not likely tonight, my friend, but probably next week when we don't have so much Extreme 2 music to worry about.
9938059	9944840	Socorina says, what does each member of the Orange Lounge Radio crew prefer, hairy or hairless balls?
9952629	9953449	It's a toss-up.
9954090	9962354	Because, you know, there's some days where I'm like, you know, wake up in the morning, you know, and, you know, want to get my daily, you know, porn for breakfast.
9962514	9965356	And it's like, maybe I want to see hairy balls.
9966516	9971079	Sometimes, you know, I wake up in the morning and I want to see hairless balls.
9972179	9976121	Sometimes I have that, you know, aching desire to shave my own balls.
9976401	9976762	Loki.
9977222	9977722	Okay, here you go.
9978373	9982875	How about balls that aren't as hot as the surface of the sun and fucking sweaty all the time?
9983615	9984896	Those are the balls that we prefer.
9985816	9987097	How about bowling balls?
9989398	9990258	I like cheese balls.
9991019	9991799	Cheese balls are good.
9992139	9999823	Jazz says... Jazz, the answer to your question is I can't say that on air.
10001763	10002404	That's what it is.
10003664	10004865	I like meatballs.
10007059	10007619	For my Kia.
10007639	10008620	Me and cheese balls.
10009900	10011341	Jazz, don't repeat it.
10011561	10012281	Don't repeat it, Jazz.
10013062	10020205	Zachu says, what will I win if I guess the DDR song used in last Friday's episode of MTV2's Video Mods featuring DDR Extreme 2?
10022246	10022686	I don't know.
10023067	10025128	Does anybody in this room watch MTV?
10025288	10026088	I know, I don't watch it.
10026148	10026488	I don't.
10026528	10027329	Are they giving it away?
10027349	10028309	Reject boss icons!
10028429	10029330	Are they giving it away?
10029350	10029970	Because we're not.
10030270	10033852	After they did that next marathon for like five days straight, I was like...
10035325	10036626	I can't watch this channel anymore.
10039308	10043052	Jaded wants to know, where did you get the Ask Orange Lounge intro music?
10043392	10048876	The Ask Orange Lounge intro music is actually Journey to the Wonderland from Keyboard Mania 2.
10050718	10053540	It's Keyboard Mania 2, it's Journey to the Wonderland by NPB.
10054821	10058845	And then the lyrics, of course, are sung by yours truly, One and Only Sky.
10063343	10064463	Um, let's see.
10065324	10071088	Dark Knight says, Hey Sky, you should play Get Busy just to throw the chat room off.
10071609	10077453	Uh, you know, there's a reason I didn't play Get Busy tonight, and that's because I had to play it, um, 20 times this week in Mission Mode.
10078714	10083417	Rini wants to know, Could you help a poor soul with my break problem, pretty please?
10083857	10087300	I already use Step Mania, and I can't do that fuck-ass syncing.
10088821	10089421	Um, hee hee.
10090042	10090102	Um,
10090703	10095384	You know, Break, I remember, was in one of the Oni courses in Extreme, wasn't it?
10095424	10098864	Like, you had to play Sexy Planet Oni on Break or something, and it was a bitch.
10099545	10107666	The best way to do it was to play that song over and over in regular mode, and so you kind of, like, you start to hear your feet as a separate rhythm in your head.
10108166	10110006	It's very similar to the way you get really good at 2DX.
10110026	10111927	You start to hear what the key patterns sound like in your head.
10111947	10118548	That's what you're going to have to do with this DDR thing, is play the song over and over in regular mode and hear the pattern of the steps in your head, and then...
10119228	10122109	Of course, then again, if it's a song he hasn't unlocked yet, I guess you're just fucked.
10122209	10123230	I'm sorry, I don't know what to tell you.
10124651	10127592	Break, by the way, is when the arrows slow down as they reach the top.
10127872	10129793	It's the reverse of boost.
10131153	10135395	Bugged wants to know, what fuck-ass games have you had the joy of playing as of late?
10138937	10139217	None.
10139557	10140978	I played Pack'n Roll earlier today.
10140998	10141738	It was kind of cool.
10141798	10143119	I'll talk about that more on the podcast.
10143539	10145480	I can't even remember the last video game I played.
10147103	10148944	Didn't I make you play something?
10148964	10149904	Sweaty Balls of the Game.
10150404	10151425	Final Fantasy XI?
10151465	10151845	Hello.
10152225	10153546	As in Sweaty Balls of the Game.
10154066	10155186	Sweaty Balls of the Game.
10156207	10156487	Loki?
10156707	10158668	As in The White Mage is the Bitch of the Game.
10158988	10161089	Well, I had to feed Taco again this morning.
10161109	10164010	He hasn't run away yet, even though I haven't fed him for three days.
10164990	10166351	And I played Lost in Blue a bit.
10168405	10170907	I'm going to really get a dog named Taco.
10171388	10172669	That's a cool name for a child.
10172729	10187562	I'm telling you, after the joke last night about why Helen Keller's dog ran away, my next dog's name is... The other day I was telling Helen Keller jokes to Loki and his fiancée and they just loved it.
10188062	10190284	It was even funnier because I was partially drunk.
10191649	10193331	It's the funniest I've seen you in a while.
10193411	10196314	DarkSakura, I know, because I can't be funny unless I'm ripping off other people's jokes.
10196354	10196734	That's true.
10197135	10198776	DarkSakura, we need your mama joke of the week.
10200778	10201299	Give me a second.
10201339	10202159	Okay, you need to work on that.
10202299	10202540	All right.
10204862	10210827	DarkTreadStudio wants to know, Will Sky's voice, the video game, ever return, or is it doomed to obscurity?
10211448	10212929	My friend, it is doomed to obscurity.
10212949	10213210	What?
10214187	10216268	It's an inside joke from like two and a half years ago on this.
10216628	10228772	I used to get on the, we used to do, before we were a real structured station, not that we ever have been a structured station, but DarkSakura and I used to do what was called fuck-off shows where we would just randomly get on the stream.
10228792	10229792	We didn't have scheduled programs.
10230032	10239716	We would just randomly, like it could be midnight on a Tuesday night, we would just randomly get on the stream and kick everyone off and go live and do our own show, just play music we wanted to play and do whatever the fuck we wanted.
10240016	10243757	So we called it a fuck-off show because if you didn't like what we were doing, you could fuck off.
10245069	10248610	and I used to get on there and I would sing my own versions of Bobani songs.
10248650	10251071	Like I had my own version of Cowgirl and other things.
10251291	10254252	So I think they're wondering if I'm going to do that again and the answer is no.
10255233	10256053	Okay, I have one.
10256613	10256813	What?
10258694	10259934	Your mama's so stupid.
10259954	10260614	Wait, wait, wait.
10260694	10261314	I need the music.
10261414	10261895	I need the music.
10262035	10264195	I need to hype this up.
10265536	10268997	Oh, I have never heard that Helen Keller joke before in the chat room there.
10270097	10272258	What did Helen Keller do when she fell off a cliff?
10273553	10274974	She screamed her hands off.
10275654	10282096	We're going to get some angry emails.
10283096	10283536	That's all right.
10284737	10286538	That's what we do here on the show.
10287018	10287278	All right.
10287998	10288418	Wait, hold on.
10289338	10291159	I wasn't ready to do it.
10291179	10293200	Go to your Big Boobs 1 icon.
10293240	10296321	Yeah, you probably hit all my music in the Big Boobs folder.
10297181	10298982	Peeing in glass bowls or whatever the shit.
10299242	10302163	I'm going to make up for it by saying a couple of them.
10303274	10312762	Alright kids, it's DarkSakura's Yo Mama Joke of the Week.
10313363	10313903	DarkSakura.
10313923	10314684	I have a couple.
10315485	10318988	Yo Mama's so stupid, I told her drinks were on the house so she went and got a lighter.
10319828	10320409	And my other one.
10324719	10327560	Yo mama so stupid she took the Pepsi challenge and chose Coke.
10329721	10330221	Wait.
10331962	10334383	I said that joke wrong because I meant to be Mountain Dew.
10341026	10343567	Yo mama so stupid she reckoned a quarterback was a refund.
10349750	10350911	You're laughing at yourself.
10351811	10354112	Yo mama so stupid she sold her car for gas money.
10354653	10359617	Your mama says stupid, when you were born she looked at your umbilical cord and said, well, it comes with a cable.
10378820	10384622	ColorofSakura wants to know, if you could remake any video game from the 16-bit era or earlier, what would it be?
10385442	10386383	Guardian Legend.
10387123	10387923	Street Fighter II.
10387963	10388323	What?
10388363	10389204	No, I'm kidding.
10389244	10389824	Repeat the question.
10389964	10393345	If you could remake any video game from the 16-bit era or earlier, what would it be?
10393505	10394125	Guardian Legend.
10394425	10394925	Kid Icarus.
10394985	10395846	I'll say something different, then.
10398767	10399727	Custer's Revenge.
10399747	10401007	I just said Street Fighter II, man.
10401808	10402288	X-Man.
10406840	10409383	I think that they've already remade all the games that I like.
10410724	10411485	Oregon Trail!
10412946	10413927	You know, like Metroid.
10415208	10420373	And the last question we have tonight, Nince wants to know, will Loki singing ever come back to the show?
10422094	10424677	We actually have to wait for Karaoke Revolution Party to come out.
10425237	10429061	I hope not, and we don't really have the setup for that, luckily.
10431002	10432724	Well, we can always make it happen.
10433890	10434390	No, you can't.
10434530	10436171	I think that you should play I'm Stayin' In.
10437091	10438211	I don't know if I have it anymore.
10438251	10439111	I gotta dig for it.
10440031	10441072	I used to have it somewhere.
10441632	10444693	We gotta do a retrospective episode at the end of the year or something, and we'll do it on that.
10444733	10445173	What, Loki?
10445293	10445473	What?
10446393	10450074	I know where I should put that song, even though I don't want to put that song there.
10450214	10450494	Hmm.
10451994	10452554	On the thing.
10452874	10453795	Oh, the thing, yeah.
10453975	10454235	Yeah.
10455215	10455295	Um...
10456152	10456733	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
10474758	10484405	You know what we should do is get Loki to go to one of those recording studios that they have at the theme park and cut his own CD because I did that once and the old radio program I was on years ago before this show.
10484645	10485846	I remember that.
10486146	10486867	I was there.
10486887	10488107	Yeah, I went to Great America.
10488147	10488568	Six Flags.
10488608	10489448	Oh, no, it's not Six Flags.
10489508	10491530	It was Paramount.
10491570	10492831	We went to see Margaret Cho.
10493271	10493891	DarkSakura.com
10514092	10517494	I saved the best for last by what's her name?
10518575	10543171	Penthouse model, American Beauty Queen Vanessa Williams So I recorded this song and then somehow the CD fell into the hands of Travis who was the host over on Understation Live and every week he would play that song and make fun of it I don't know Alright
10545515	10547716	I think it's about time to wrap up the show, boys and girls.
10547956	10548337	We're done.
10548817	10549437	The show's over.
10549797	10550077	I know.
10550197	10551498	Sadness, huh?
10551618	10552539	First off, it's already over.
10552579	10553239	Can I get quiet now?
10554039	10554640	Yeah, if you want.
10554660	10555080	You can go cry.
10555100	10556800	I've never stayed through a whole show before.
10556961	10557201	I know.
10557801	10559602	You were our special guest tonight, extra.
10559642	10561002	I was a special guest.
10561223	10561903	Extra special.
10561963	10563343	Our chat room seems to like you.
10563363	10564264	They do.
10564344	10570847	Some of them think we should add you on permanently, and to that I say... You gave us the Bleach Household joke.
10571587	10572007	What was that?
10572107	10573448	You gave us the Bleach Tassel joke.
10573548	10576068	I did give you that Bleach Tassel joke.
10576208	10578489	I am taking immense pride over that.
10581370	10582971	That is really funny.
10583191	10584031	Keep doing that.
10584191	10585611	Alright, let's go around.
10586072	10587552	I am going to choke that ferret.
10590013	10591953	Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
10592994	10597875	We sent Zero on fire and sent him back to his flea infested... I'm sorry, did I say that on the air?
10598255	10599996	We sent him back to live in a hole.
10601115	10602196	Extifer, your final thought.
10605579	10611825	Akira Yamamoka should be a drink called Akira Yamamoka.
10616109	10617270	Wait, did I pronounce his name right?
10618551	10619011	I hate you.
10620112	10621253	Loki, your final thought.
10624816	10626678	Extifer, hand him the goddamn microphone.
10626698	10627639	My microphone?
10629116	10630957	Loki, turn on the goddamn microphone.
10631658	10632658	It's all his fault.
10633298	10635100	This is why your novel would be on the show.
10635220	10635520	Never.
10636801	10637341	Never, ever.
10637361	10638562	I've been evicted from the room.
10639502	10641143	No one can hear you because you don't have the microphone.
10641283	10642564	Anyways.
10643544	10647267	My final thought is... I have to finish the thing.
10647467	10648627	But it's done, pretty much.
10649448	10650208	Okay, super.
10652570	10655511	And my final thought, just for you, chat room, you bitches.
10656252	10657412	My final thought is Polovistian.
10657472	10657993	Polovistian.
10659673	10660395	Pavlostian.
10660495	10661336	Pavlostian.
10662479	10663260	I hate you guys.
10663982	10666046	DarkSakura, your final thought.
10666768	10671177	Reject false icons and sweaty balls.
10672299	10674240	One word to sum it all up.
10674300	10675680	To shut the show up.
