00:05.000 --> 00:12.000
You're tuned in to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your podcast home for all the

00:12.000 --> 00:15.000
latest video game news and gamer chat.

00:15.000 --> 00:20.000
Now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Logan.

00:20.000 --> 00:28.000
Alright, here we are back with our final day here at E3, and I don't know if my co-hosts

00:28.000 --> 00:34.000
My co-hosts are feeling it like I am, but I think I'm ready for this show to be about over by now.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky.

00:36.000 --> 00:39.000
My co-hosts, Loki, the one and only.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.000
Hi.

00:40.000 --> 00:44.000
And also, Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
I need a new body.

00:46.000 --> 00:50.000
So what do you think? Are you ready for this show to be over, or what, Loki?

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
I'm more than ready, and it's over.

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
Yay.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
Dark Sakura.

00:56.000 --> 01:00.240
No, I could go five more days in E3, like they do at Anime Expo, they add another day

01:00.240 --> 01:06.100
every year, and then you do nothing but see video games, and, uh, oh yeah, sure.

01:06.100 --> 01:10.460
Now for those people at home that are probably yelling at us, going, dude, I would kill to

01:10.460 --> 01:15.820
be at E3 for anything, and you guys are bitching about having to be there for three whole days,

01:15.820 --> 01:16.820
what would you say?

01:16.820 --> 01:18.740
Why is it that you kinda get burned out on E3?

01:18.740 --> 01:19.740
Okay, how about this?

01:19.740 --> 01:20.740
Why are you feeling it?

01:20.740 --> 01:21.740
I'll tell you what.

01:21.740 --> 01:24.860
Let's say you're on the East Coast, start walking to E3.

01:24.860 --> 01:29.500
Once you get there, now you know what it's like to be there for three days.

01:29.500 --> 01:35.260
Your feet hurt like a bitch, and you're bored out of your mind, and you're thinking, why?

01:35.260 --> 01:36.260
Why is it three days long?

01:36.260 --> 01:37.260
No, I don't know.

01:37.260 --> 01:42.260
Actually, it's just you walk around pretty much everything, and you've already seen everything.

01:42.260 --> 01:49.420
Unless you're in meetings all the time, like we aren't, you really see pretty much everything

01:49.420 --> 01:50.420
in about two days.

01:50.420 --> 01:51.420
I don't know.

01:51.420 --> 01:53.780
I found more stuff today.

01:53.780 --> 01:56.380
Actually, I made today my standing in line day

01:56.980 --> 01:59.420
so I got in to see the

02:00.200 --> 02:04.720
Something I'm going to talk about momentarily on the show and I went into the SEGA theater again

02:04.720 --> 02:08.580
I'm gonna talk about that later, but I got to get in and see things and I got into

02:09.620 --> 02:11.620
running into people who can

02:12.100 --> 02:14.020
things I

02:14.020 --> 02:16.780
Think somebody summed it up best. I remember who said this

02:16.780 --> 02:21.160
I want to say it was Mel B that told me this something about the first day

02:21.160 --> 02:24.760
You're just overwhelmed and you want to take everything in the second day

02:24.760 --> 02:25.880
You know where you want to go?

02:25.880 --> 02:27.880
You know what boost you want to do the third day?

02:28.000 --> 02:30.480
You've seen it all and you're just kind of winding down

02:30.720 --> 02:32.720
So I think that about sums it up for me

02:32.720 --> 02:36.800
But I know a lot of us got to do some cool things on this third day

02:36.800 --> 02:41.360
So I would you typically do the three things but well, I won't put a cap on it today

02:41.360 --> 02:46.000
Let's just say share things with our audience that you think was cool today. We'll start off with dark soccer essence

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
I know she's got at least two things right there. I

02:48.000 --> 02:53.120
I went into the Sega theater today, got to see the new Sonic game that they're doing.

02:53.120 --> 02:56.160
I believe it's for the Xbox 360.

02:56.160 --> 03:00.200
It's pretty damn good looking, and it was a real-time demo.

03:00.200 --> 03:06.440
So he was playing it, one of the developers there was playing it as they were doing it.

03:06.440 --> 03:13.840
There's that serial killer game, Conspiracy, I think that's what it's called, Condemned.

03:13.840 --> 03:14.840
I know it was a con something.

03:14.840 --> 03:20.540
see my brains fries the end of the con the kid down that was pretty spooky but

03:20.540 --> 03:25.300
it seems sorta hi I'm a big ugly thing I'm gonna hit you on the head with this

03:25.300 --> 03:34.780
hammer BAM L you know that type of game and then there was there's a full auto

03:34.780 --> 03:38.620
game now the full auto is pretty cool is sort of like I'm going to run into this

03:38.620 --> 03:43.580
building wait no I don't want to do that rewind called the unrack and then drive

03:43.580 --> 03:48.820
forward keep going that was pretty cool and also met somebody his name was Eric

03:48.820 --> 03:54.660
if he's listening I introduced him to the show so hi in fact to all of the

03:54.660 --> 04:00.580
people who I have met at the convention if you're listening to us hi I also met

04:00.580 --> 04:07.700
one of Jason's friends randomly sitting on the floor at squenix but I'll go

04:07.700 --> 04:10.900
into that later anyway yeah I couldn't get into the

04:10.900 --> 04:15.660
They were out of tickets by the time I got up there, which was shitty.

04:15.660 --> 04:21.660
So I trotted on over, and I tried to peek at the Activision stuff, I was like, eh, so

04:21.660 --> 04:23.400
I kept going.

04:23.400 --> 04:29.140
Made it over to where the PS3 line was.

04:29.140 --> 04:32.580
And for being wrapped around the building, the wait was not as long as I thought it was

04:32.580 --> 04:36.280
going to be there, saying, this is a three hour wait, but I got up there in 25 minutes

04:36.280 --> 04:39.760
and I was at the tail end.

04:39.760 --> 04:44.220
They did some type of HDTV demo thing, and then they actually let you take you into another

04:44.220 --> 04:50.980
theater where you can sit for a little bit, and they showed what the system can do.

04:50.980 --> 04:51.980
It's rad.

04:51.980 --> 04:55.380
They built a city there on screen.

04:55.380 --> 04:58.120
They also showed some of the games that are currently in development.

04:58.120 --> 05:03.660
They didn't list names of the games, but some of us could tell one of them was a new Tekken.

05:03.660 --> 05:08.600
They showed Jin up there with sweat coming out of his body, and this apparently is done

05:08.600 --> 05:13.760
in-game engine one that looked like one of the romance of the three kingdoms

05:13.760 --> 05:20.080
games some type of off-road game this was a very destructive off-road game

05:20.080 --> 05:24.120
like it shows this one scene with a motorbike guy getting back up on his

05:24.120 --> 05:29.200
bike with a car about to land on him after an explosion it was pretty pretty

05:29.200 --> 05:36.080
intense I got out I see the P of the ps3 took pictures of the ps3 which will be

05:36.080 --> 05:43.240
on OrangeChallengeRadio.com. The other cool thing is that I played more

05:43.240 --> 05:49.640
Nintendogs. I played Romancing Saga and actually I got into H-Tech. That was

05:49.640 --> 05:55.640
pretty cool. Got to play a new game for anyone who is an anime fan or big

05:55.640 --> 06:02.480
importer of RPGs. Coming out on the PSP, I do believe he said Winter, is Popokoros,

06:02.480 --> 06:09.920
which has been a pretty big series it's a 2d RPG it is the first true RPG for

06:09.920 --> 06:14.880
the system to be released in the States so be on the lookout for that and also

06:14.880 --> 06:22.400
got to see formula front armored core that was pretty cool working on right

06:22.400 --> 06:27.520
now is a wild arms ultra F which has actually been delayed by about five

06:27.520 --> 06:35.020
months but it gives them time to tweak the translation also RPG maker 3 now

06:35.020 --> 06:39.260
that I have to say I was very impressed with the last RPG maker you know I was

06:39.260 --> 06:41.860
kind of into that I was into the first one because I was one of those people

06:41.860 --> 06:45.660
that was petitioning for it to get off the Super Famicom and get over the US

06:45.660 --> 06:52.540
this one was pretty pretty awesome I mean it's not like you're playing you

06:52.540 --> 06:55.580
know this little ghetto game that you just piece together with duct tape this

06:55.580 --> 07:01.120
This is fully rendered because you can paint your textures onto mountains.

07:01.120 --> 07:05.480
You choose what style your sprites are going to look like.

07:05.480 --> 07:09.440
You can choose, you know how in RPGs it has a picture of your character over the text

07:09.440 --> 07:10.440
box.

07:10.440 --> 07:13.560
You can do conversation characters and have them in an anime style or you can have them

07:13.560 --> 07:15.440
in a conventional, you know, American style.

07:15.440 --> 07:17.180
It's pretty cool.

07:17.180 --> 07:18.180
Is it?

07:18.180 --> 07:21.080
Now, there was a game maker that was supposed to be coming out on the PSP.

07:21.080 --> 07:23.080
Is this the game maker that's on the PSP?

07:23.080 --> 07:24.080
This is on PS2.

07:24.080 --> 07:25.080
Now, PS2.

07:25.080 --> 07:29.680
There's one coming out for the PSP, and there's so many things they could do for this,

07:29.680 --> 07:33.840
but I know they're not gonna, because they just don't think ahead.

07:33.840 --> 07:39.720
But, like, for example, the PSP, you could have it where you could upload your own pictures or something like that

07:39.720 --> 07:44.800
from the internet, or your own music, or something. You make your own game and then distribute that game over the internet.

07:44.800 --> 07:45.960
That would be cool.

07:45.960 --> 07:48.440
Of course, you know, they're not going to think of that.

07:48.440 --> 07:52.040
think of that they don't they might have thought of it but it might take money

07:52.040 --> 07:58.000
out of their pocket all right Loki what kind of stuff did you look at today I

07:58.000 --> 08:06.600
looked at a few things I went back for a second peek at what was that that one

08:06.600 --> 08:12.560
erotic whatever feel three feels every next game the dominant I had to show

08:12.560 --> 08:20.480
that to Jason today apparently there's peripherals for this game sex

08:20.480 --> 08:25.640
peripherals for this game I'll leave it at that use your imagination boys

08:25.640 --> 08:33.840
basically folks this is the definition of cyber sex the res vibration machine

08:33.840 --> 08:39.160
to shame oh this is a device that vibrates that's not gonna be confused

08:39.160 --> 08:42.600
with a trans vibrator, this is a vibrator.

08:42.600 --> 08:44.640
Let's just let the audience use their imagination

08:44.640 --> 08:45.480
on that one, shall we?

08:45.480 --> 08:46.760
It's very phallic.

08:46.760 --> 08:50.760
Anyways, so yeah, that's interesting.

08:50.760 --> 08:53.420
I'll have to check out the website later.

08:53.420 --> 08:56.600
And then, I like how it's like, it's kind of weird.

08:56.600 --> 08:58.440
Yeah, I'll check it later.

08:58.440 --> 08:59.840
I have to check it out.

08:59.840 --> 09:02.180
You have to research it on behalf of our listeners,

09:02.180 --> 09:04.160
of course, not that you have any interest in this.

09:04.160 --> 09:06.120
You're just doing it as a favor to the listeners, right?

09:06.120 --> 09:08.600
I honestly don't want to buy this.

09:08.600 --> 09:13.080
This is one of those games that's going to be weird because, you know, I can't go about

09:13.080 --> 09:16.040
normal methods of distribution for this game.

09:16.040 --> 09:17.040
So, whatever.

09:17.040 --> 09:23.920
But anyways, I got to finally, finally play In the Groove today on Rockstar's new...

09:23.920 --> 09:27.720
Yes, which is interesting because they weren't showing the game on Wednesday when we went

09:27.720 --> 09:30.320
by the booth the first time, but today they actually showed the game.

09:30.320 --> 09:39.040
In The Groove, and I got to test out Red Octane's new pads, they're the metal ones, and I have

09:39.040 --> 09:42.120
to say they both disappoint me very much.

09:42.120 --> 09:46.000
And guess what, I still have the same opinion about In The Groove, it's still a knockoff

09:46.000 --> 09:50.480
of DDR and it's gonna be treated as such in my mind.

09:50.480 --> 09:56.560
Those new pads, they look pretty solid, but they've got a few fatal flaws in them, one

09:56.560 --> 10:00.360
One of them being that the arrows are recessed too far, and it feels really awkward playing

10:00.360 --> 10:01.840
on them, and I didn't like them one bit.

10:01.840 --> 10:04.320
I don't know, it might be a personal opinion thing, because when I played them a couple

10:04.320 --> 10:05.960
weeks ago, they were great to me.

10:05.960 --> 10:06.960
I really enjoyed them.

10:06.960 --> 10:07.960
I don't know.

10:07.960 --> 10:12.200
All they gotta do to fix it, raise up those arrows just, you know, just a teeny little

10:12.200 --> 10:16.760
bit, you know, just a few millimeters just to make it, you know, just set in a little

10:16.760 --> 10:19.000
bit, not too much, don't go crazy.

10:19.000 --> 10:23.280
And then, instead of making them all rubbery, make them metal.

10:23.280 --> 10:26.000
But then you played two other DDR mats as well, right?

10:26.000 --> 10:30.120
Yeah, and then that one starts to look pretty good when you look at the other two, right?

10:30.120 --> 10:36.080
Okay, the second one was DDRgame.com, their metal pad with their bar.

10:36.080 --> 10:37.080
Which had a bar, yeah.

10:37.080 --> 10:38.080
Which had a bar, yeah.

10:38.080 --> 10:39.360
Yeah, the pad sucked.

10:39.360 --> 10:45.160
Okay, those pads, they were all shiny and it basically had soft pad syndrome where you

10:45.160 --> 10:47.160
can't tell where the hell the arrows are.

10:47.160 --> 10:53.600
what's worse about the DDR game.com ones if you miss the pad you're gonna like

10:53.600 --> 10:57.140
hurt your your leg because it's raised up which happened to somebody we know

10:57.140 --> 11:02.500
actually yeah happened to someone and so I I cannot recommend those but it's the

11:02.500 --> 11:06.180
only one you're gonna see that has like the solo arrows actually on it although

11:06.180 --> 11:11.900
most now you know they did do something kind of neat and I'll give them credit

11:11.900 --> 11:15.420
for this cuz I mean soft pads they're pretty much all the same out there but

11:15.420 --> 11:19.060
They actually had a doubles soft pad, which I thought was pretty cool.

11:19.060 --> 11:23.420
The only thing I could see that would suck about that is if one side breaks down.

11:23.420 --> 11:24.420
Oh crap.

11:24.420 --> 11:25.420
You're st...

11:25.420 --> 11:26.420
Anyways.

11:26.420 --> 11:28.900
So yeah, I tried that one, that was pretty cool.

11:28.900 --> 11:34.780
And really, I don't know, DDR pads, they're just all about the same.

11:34.780 --> 11:38.300
Then what else did I get to try out today?

11:38.300 --> 11:41.680
I watched Kingdom Hearts 2, that looked pretty cool.

11:41.680 --> 11:46.560
And then, really, it's just a lot of hanging around Konami's booth, checking that stuff

11:46.560 --> 11:52.380
out, and talking to some of the people, trying to get, not necessarily press kits, but on

11:52.380 --> 11:55.540
their email list for my work, and that kind of thing.

11:55.540 --> 12:01.420
And I have to say that the people at EA can suck it, because they have this, we're better

12:01.420 --> 12:06.780
than everyone else attitude, and they've done that to our company as a whole.

12:06.780 --> 12:10.080
When our company, yeah, we're distributing games, they're like, yeah, we don't care.

12:10.080 --> 12:15.040
just like big deal you know you know the hell with them and it seems like you

12:15.040 --> 12:17.680
know honestly from hearing other people's they have anything at their

12:17.680 --> 12:24.000
booth that interested any of us they had their new drive most wanted I was

12:24.000 --> 12:28.760
looking at the stuff for the Sims Sims 2 for PSP is pretty cool that was

12:28.760 --> 12:33.320
interesting and oh I didn't waiting lines had I known that the ps3 line was

12:33.320 --> 12:37.480
gonna be so short I would have waited for that but whatever but the ps3 line

12:37.480 --> 12:41.440
was next to the Zelda line and both of them went about the same distance back

12:41.440 --> 12:45.180
and the Zelda line was three hour away because I guess they weren't taking in

12:45.180 --> 12:50.080
as many people at a time or something so yeah it was kind of a misconception at

12:50.080 --> 12:54.320
least I I certainly thought that PlayStation would it would be one I'd be

12:54.320 --> 12:57.860
waiting long or just as long in as Zelda but the interesting thing is that the

12:57.860 --> 13:00.860
Zelda line ran out of shirts today so some people that didn't went through the

13:00.860 --> 13:04.840
whole thing didn't even get a shirt I did get the plane in ten dogs and that

13:04.840 --> 13:08.940
game is so damn yeah I've got to get that game I very knew I was gonna buy

13:08.940 --> 13:14.020
the game before you know I actually played it but it's just it's such a game

13:14.020 --> 13:18.400
I don't even know this is gonna honestly people are gonna play this game and it's

13:18.400 --> 13:22.120
gonna be just like Animal Crossing where you just can't get enough of it you're

13:22.120 --> 13:25.040
just gonna be playing at all time you're gonna be worrying about your pets are

13:25.040 --> 13:28.120
not getting walked or something when you're out like I think it is gonna be

13:28.120 --> 13:32.720
like the next Tamagotchi now don't shun it just just because I say it that way

13:32.720 --> 13:39.760
but I think it's gonna be something that appeals to a more broader age range

13:39.760 --> 13:44.000
yeah just the whole trade everything now now Jamie bring just brought up

13:44.000 --> 13:49.360
something to me I forgot to ask her how was the boomerang on the ps3 what was

13:49.360 --> 13:53.240
your impressions of the boomerang I'm looking at my picture of it right now

13:53.240 --> 13:58.880
I'm trying to imagine how this thing would feel in my hand now for those that

13:58.880 --> 14:02.140
are a little bit lost the boomerang is what we are calling the controller on

14:02.140 --> 14:06.780
the ps3 because it looks like well a boomerang it does it looks like a half

14:06.780 --> 14:10.300
you know what it looks like it looks like an old-school Microsoft Sidewinder

14:10.300 --> 14:18.340
yeah guess what folks I don't honestly stick with dual shock that's what I say

14:18.340 --> 14:24.580
yeah I couldn't just it didn't seem like it would be all that comfortable but I

14:24.580 --> 14:29.740
don't know and it's only conceptual it said concept controller so maybe they'll

14:29.740 --> 14:33.980
make some changes and make it less boomerangy I don't know stuff I checked

14:33.980 --> 14:39.060
out today I actually got to play a little bit of Kingdom Hearts 2 and very

14:39.060 --> 14:43.460
interesting I have to admit I wasn't so into the first one I know a lot of

14:43.460 --> 14:46.820
people consider to be this great game and I I respect the game but I couldn't

14:46.820 --> 14:51.100
get into it because I got really really bothered by the camera like that whole

14:51.100 --> 14:55.660
3d thing that can annoy me on some of those games and I didn't have the same

14:55.660 --> 14:58.500
problems and Kingdom Hearts 2 it looks like they went back and fix some of that

14:58.500 --> 15:04.360
and they added a couple new modes to like they have this overdrive mode like you might think of this from Final Fantasies kind of

15:04.360 --> 15:07.960
Similar but more towards the Kingdom Hearts concept or if you build up enough strength

15:07.960 --> 15:11.220
You can go into overdrive mode and you transform and you have two blades

15:11.220 --> 15:14.160
So that's kind of neat but it was kind of interesting because I had two different

15:14.480 --> 15:18.360
Representatives from Square Enix pointed out to me. Did you know about overdrive mode? Did you try it?

15:18.360 --> 15:22.560
Did you try it like I guess it's the big selling point of the game or something. I don't know but um

15:22.720 --> 15:25.320
The levels I play were kind of cool. They had the Mulan and the

15:25.320 --> 15:32.120
Hercules level playable so I'm kind of neat um yeah did you actually of course

15:32.120 --> 15:36.760
you had our on there did you get the fusions no I did not get a chance to do

15:36.760 --> 15:41.800
the fusion with goofy the best of the Valor one that's awesome he dual wields

15:41.800 --> 15:44.760
kill the key blades yeah having our on in the game was kind of neat though I

15:44.760 --> 15:47.680
gotta say that's kind of neat addition to the game another game I checked out

15:47.680 --> 15:52.400
today was Hello Kitty roller rescue now stop laughing stop laughing I was drawn

15:52.400 --> 15:56.000
of this game because I love Batsumaru the penguin and I saw that he was in the game

15:56.000 --> 16:01.040
so I had to check it out. Hello Kitty Roller Rescue is very interesting. I'm sure there's

16:01.040 --> 16:06.820
an audience out there for it somewhere. Even though I do love Batsumaru I can't personally

16:06.820 --> 16:11.160
say I would buy this game. I would buy it for a child but I don't know if I could buy

16:11.160 --> 16:15.960
it for myself. I became too frustrated because Hello Kitty would not jump over everything.

16:15.960 --> 16:19.960
There was only certain things like some weird collision detection. I don't know what it

16:19.960 --> 16:25.920
is but just it wasn't as interactive as it just felt weird I but a kid would be

16:25.920 --> 16:30.200
into it a kid wouldn't be bothered by it so and that's what it was really for so

16:30.200 --> 16:35.200
that was one of the other games I saw today I guess that's all I really want

16:35.200 --> 16:38.440
to say oh one other game I actually saw this yesterday but I forgot to bring it

16:38.440 --> 16:41.960
up on yesterday's show the Capcom collection that has a bunch of old

16:41.960 --> 16:46.000
school Capcom arcade games ghouls and ghosts super goals and ghosts and the

16:46.000 --> 16:50.600
one I played 1943 all in it kind of a neat collection seems like the kind of

16:50.600 --> 16:54.160
the popular trend right now with the retro and is having the flashback

16:54.160 --> 17:00.080
console Atari having the Capcom collection the Namco one they're doing a

17:00.080 --> 17:04.120
new one that's really big very interesting trend did you get to play

17:04.120 --> 17:09.760
any final fight I did not play final fight it's very wonky right now it was

17:09.760 --> 17:14.160
pretty good new final fight okay yeah I actually played the new romancing saga

17:14.160 --> 17:20.720
I was never big into the saga games. It was kind of cool, but it looks like a freaking ps1 game

17:20.880 --> 17:24.120
It's just not clean. Yeah, saga sagas were games

17:27.600 --> 17:33.220
All right, okay now since the show is all done I'd like us to go around and think about the best

17:33.940 --> 17:39.880
Let's do best booth at the show first the best booth who there at the show

17:39.880 --> 17:47.660
Do you believe had the best booth out of anybody and why anybody want to start it's kind of dark Sakura

17:47.660 --> 17:49.660
There's things that

17:50.060 --> 17:54.340
Places that did things better. I think but overall I have to give

17:56.200 --> 18:00.000
It's actually a toss-up it really is a toss-up. Okay a tie. What do you think?

18:01.980 --> 18:08.260
I'm gonna have to say that between Konami and Namco. I mean just Konami went all out with that show

18:08.260 --> 18:11.500
That was really cool. You know so as far as their presentation

18:12.300 --> 18:18.620
Namco I'm not able to but Konami had the better show, but as far as overall like I said saying yesterday friendliness

18:19.460 --> 18:21.020
knowledge

18:21.020 --> 18:27.420
You know the fun swag I have to say that Namco really impressed me very much their lineup

18:27.420 --> 18:29.700
I got to play. Oh, I also play pack and roll and

18:31.220 --> 18:36.480
When a person when someone came over and saw that I had the the hang of playing it they didn't harass me

18:36.480 --> 18:41.740
I just got to play it we talked a little bit about it as the people at Namco mobile were fun

18:41.740 --> 18:47.560
They were just happy and that you know, they ran out of the little squishy pac-man things, but they apologized for it

18:47.560 --> 18:54.600
And you know, they knew what they were doing. They were happy to do what they were doing our co-host

18:55.240 --> 18:56.360
for

18:56.360 --> 19:02.960
Outside the box lanky style. He actually got a short video clip of the Prince of the cosmos

19:04.160 --> 19:05.800
breakdancing

19:05.800 --> 19:07.600
really

19:07.600 --> 19:09.520
Hoping to make a live journal icon out of that

19:09.520 --> 19:13.200
We'll have to post that in our orange lounge live journal community once that's done. Okay, so

19:13.840 --> 19:16.760
dark soccer saying toss-up between Konami and Namco

19:17.320 --> 19:19.760
Loki what do you think was the best booth at the show?

19:23.260 --> 19:25.260
Well

19:25.260 --> 19:32.300
Man, it's tough. I only I you know, I'm so biased just because I hung out Konami's booth, you know a long time

19:32.300 --> 19:35.080
You know pretty much the majority of time while I was there

19:35.720 --> 19:37.720
Only because a few things one

19:38.160 --> 19:42.380
You know the whole stage area right there where they had a DDR games very open

19:42.380 --> 19:47.360
You're not really feeling crowded in there plus you can sit down and like watch the little trailer reel that they've got there

19:47.900 --> 19:49.900
Couldn't really do that anywhere else also

19:50.400 --> 19:56.160
I guess as far as being the least offensive booth of them all because you know

19:56.160 --> 20:01.400
They didn't really have any booth babes jumping around they had you know actually something that appealed everyone

20:01.400 --> 20:08.920
that was kind of cool and however there is a close second that would be a game

20:08.920 --> 20:12.960
infinity and only because they had X tango in the sex game there three feel

20:12.960 --> 20:17.200
or feel three but those are pretty cool then there were some booths that just

20:17.200 --> 20:21.240
like I was confused on like for example I will do worst booth of the show a

20:21.240 --> 20:24.640
little later this isn't worse but this is just confusing I just like huh I

20:24.640 --> 20:27.920
kind of nodded my head I didn't understand it like the booth for the

20:27.920 --> 20:32.920
Singles 2 game was Triple Trouble or something like that where there's three

20:32.920 --> 20:37.640
chicks in this like roped off area is like a room just sitting there I was

20:37.640 --> 20:43.040
like I didn't get it I just didn't get him like and then guys were standing

20:43.040 --> 20:48.080
there probably sitting there thinking I wonder if they'll do it you know it's

20:48.080 --> 20:54.560
just gonna sell a game whatever I guess I didn't get it probably my second

20:54.560 --> 20:57.800
runner-up would be actually the g4 booth because they had a pretty cool setup

20:57.800 --> 21:03.640
there as far as like sit down chill watch their shows make a t-shirt which

21:03.640 --> 21:07.340
at least you're guaranteed a t-shirt that way they had um you know the people

21:07.340 --> 21:12.640
giving out those ouch kits those are pretty awesome free massages and the

21:12.640 --> 21:16.740
eight-foot Nintendo controller plus you get autographs and it was just it was

21:16.740 --> 21:21.720
kind of a good vibe there I also have to give a special kudos to the Tylenol ouch

21:21.720 --> 21:28.420
booth and the cute guy that gave me a back massage all right I would say if I

21:28.420 --> 21:32.340
had to pick one booth of the show and I hate to kind of echo what somebody else

21:32.340 --> 21:36.840
already said but honestly for me there was one booth that I feel they put all

21:36.840 --> 21:40.620
their cards out on the table everybody there was really friendly I got to play

21:40.620 --> 21:44.980
their games they have a hell of a lineup this year and that booth would be Namco

21:44.980 --> 21:48.500
I would say would be my booth of the year was I was just blown away about

21:48.500 --> 21:51.980
about what they've got to offer I think with between like we heart katamari soul

21:51.980 --> 21:58.300
caliber 3 pac-man and even semi-decent mobile games as well and usually I'm not

21:58.300 --> 22:01.860
very impressed with cell phone games but the ones I played were pretty decent for

22:01.860 --> 22:05.420
a cell phone certainly more so than some of the other ones I played at the show

22:05.420 --> 22:09.560
and I just felt that Namco they also had various stage shows going on with the

22:09.560 --> 22:13.940
whole soul caliber battles and stuff it really was for me I think the most

22:13.940 --> 22:18.460
impressive lineup at the show so that would be my booth as a show alright best

22:18.460 --> 22:27.300
you want to do best gamer you into worst booth next worst booth Dark Sakura for

22:27.300 --> 22:33.100
attitude it was Capcom bunch of apathetic no you know Capcom is a

22:33.100 --> 22:37.680
company has my love you know been long time Capcom fan but the people who they

22:37.680 --> 22:43.900
had working the information booth they were just rude rude as they could be

22:43.900 --> 22:47.420
yeah we kind of got talked about it yesterday so you guys know how we feel

22:47.420 --> 22:52.940
about it. They just displayed so much apathy that I can't say that Capcom really impressed

22:52.940 --> 22:57.820
me. They really didn't have a whole lot of games. I mean, and I want to answer an email

22:57.820 --> 23:01.220
real quick, because while we're on Capcom, I'm so sorry to interject, but if I don't

23:01.220 --> 23:05.100
do it now, I'll forget. Somebody had written us an email about Mega Man Battle Network

23:05.100 --> 23:12.820
and wanted to know how it would link up with the other DS Battle Network games. And basically

23:12.820 --> 23:16.300
what we found out is that there is some type of tournament mode, so you can play Battle

23:16.300 --> 23:19.780
network against the DS wireless but we did not see anything in any of the

23:19.780 --> 23:23.300
materials so far I haven't dug through the whole book but in a little promo

23:23.300 --> 23:25.860
video we saw we didn't see anything about it linking up to the Game Boy

23:25.860 --> 23:29.900
Advance versions or anything it's just a type of online battle tournament mode

23:29.900 --> 23:38.240
anyway I just want to interject that okay it was you know everybody put on a

23:38.240 --> 23:43.780
really good display actually Gizmondo was also really excellent for we're

23:43.780 --> 23:47.980
I'm using it as a comparison. Because you know Gizmondo was sort of like,

23:47.980 --> 23:52.260
eh, we're Gizmondo last year. And this year we're like, hey, we're freaking

23:52.260 --> 23:57.220
Gizmondo and we're bringing out people to rap and spin and dance for you and everything.

23:57.220 --> 24:03.660
But Capcom was the same as they were last year, just, we don't want to fucking be here.

24:03.660 --> 24:08.700
You know, it may be true, it may be work, but you should be happy in the work that you

24:08.700 --> 24:11.760
do. And the guys at Namco, they were having to

24:11.760 --> 24:17.000
do every bit of a boring job that you were, but they were all smiles and friendly.

24:17.000 --> 24:21.600
So Capcom must be the dullest place on earth to work for or something.

24:21.600 --> 24:25.840
Alright, so is that your worst booth or do you have an overall worst booth?

24:25.840 --> 24:29.080
Like I said, the displays and everything were great.

24:29.080 --> 24:37.120
For everywhere, there wasn't anything really disappointing as far as their look, but yeah,

24:37.120 --> 24:39.880
I have to say that Capcom, it was just the attitude.

24:39.880 --> 24:46.660
attitude soured their whole booth for me all right Loki this one's easy I'd like

24:46.660 --> 24:51.080
to give a big thank you to Rockstar for saving me a time for having to play

24:51.080 --> 24:56.300
their games because guess what they rented out this huge huge booth and put

24:56.300 --> 25:00.540
some buses there and said hi you don't get to play anything eat that you're

25:00.540 --> 25:04.260
gonna buy our games anyways suck it you know and that was it they didn't have

25:04.260 --> 25:09.500
Jack they even they had a little brief small little trailer thing and then they

25:09.500 --> 25:14.640
were giving out like what a screen cleaner or something the only picture I

25:14.640 --> 25:19.400
saw of bully was in a magazine I got there for free so I actually saw more of

25:19.400 --> 25:23.880
rock stars line up from some stupid magazine then you know their actual booth

25:23.880 --> 25:27.280
you know what I'm tired of these game companies thinking that their stuffs all

25:27.280 --> 25:31.800
kick-ass just because you know the last couple games which have all been exactly

25:31.800 --> 25:35.960
the same I might add have sold really awesome but guess what you know what

25:35.960 --> 25:41.820
save emergency suck balls so you know what I hope bully does too because I'm

25:41.820 --> 25:45.180
not giving you my money just for the same damn rehash game with maybe a

25:45.180 --> 25:49.180
different genre not necessarily different on a different time period it's

25:49.180 --> 25:54.260
set in all right well for my worst booth again I hate to echo what somebody else

25:54.260 --> 25:58.860
already said but just because of the fact that it was an eyesore I mean the

25:58.860 --> 26:03.620
booth itself was an eyesore and just the fact that they had all this space and

26:03.620 --> 26:05.580
and did nothing with it for the fans.

26:05.580 --> 26:10.100
Rockstar was by far the worst booth of E3 2005,

26:10.100 --> 26:12.180
and it just did not get me excited

26:12.180 --> 26:13.580
about any of their games at all.

26:13.580 --> 26:16.180
And granted, I was never huge on Grand Theft Auto

26:16.180 --> 26:19.220
to begin with, but I didn't wanna stop and look at anything.

26:19.220 --> 26:20.740
And I know they're trying to show new games.

26:20.740 --> 26:21.940
I didn't wanna stop and look.

26:21.940 --> 26:24.300
A horrible position for them, too.

26:24.300 --> 26:25.220
Their booth was in a bad spot, too.

26:25.220 --> 26:28.420
I understand if they wanna do press only for these games,

26:28.420 --> 26:30.100
because obviously they're probably in progress

26:30.100 --> 26:31.460
and they don't want any bad balloons.

26:31.460 --> 26:33.540
But even still, last year,

26:33.540 --> 26:35.700
Last year, I didn't see their games.

26:35.700 --> 26:37.740
Okay, they were behind closed doors,

26:37.740 --> 26:39.500
you can go and make an appointment to play it.

26:39.500 --> 26:41.500
This was just like rubbing it in your face.

26:41.500 --> 26:43.700
It's like, oh, hey, guess what?

26:43.700 --> 26:46.400
You can go in here and play games if you're pressed,

26:46.400 --> 26:47.700
and if you make an appointment.

26:47.700 --> 26:50.380
And just the chain link fence and the giant buses

26:50.380 --> 26:52.020
were just an eyesore.

26:52.020 --> 26:53.020
They didn't need to be there.

26:53.020 --> 26:53.860
Guess what?

26:53.860 --> 26:55.460
With all the other neon nice effects,

26:55.460 --> 26:58.820
just to have that ghetto looking booth was just, no.

26:58.820 --> 27:01.860
You know what, I honestly, I learned about Rockstar's

27:01.860 --> 27:06.020
lineup from posters that were outside on Hollywood Boulevard that's where I

27:06.020 --> 27:10.100
learned about their stuff so when I saw their booth with the buses like whoopity

27:10.100 --> 27:14.460
freakin doo-dah you know wow you have bully coming out look guess what it's

27:14.460 --> 27:19.660
just like Grand Theft Auto but it's in school alright best game of the show best

27:19.660 --> 27:23.140
game of the show in your opinion the game that wowed you the most and that

27:23.140 --> 27:27.220
you you will just be running out and getting the day it comes out because you

27:27.220 --> 27:33.180
were so impressed by it at the show Dark Sakura there are so many good ones

27:34.420 --> 27:39.300
making me think I mean seriously it is that difficult to pin down just one it's

27:39.300 --> 27:47.480
hard it's hard um I think I'm gonna be running right out after shoot it's like

27:47.480 --> 27:52.180
our toss-up between three games seriously name three we love Katamari

27:52.180 --> 27:56.180
Definitely. Nintendogs and Animal Crossing DS.

27:58.180 --> 28:01.180
I'm not going to go into that.

28:01.180 --> 28:05.180
I would have to say those three were the top of the show.

28:05.180 --> 28:08.180
Well, actually those three had me convinced to be the top of the show,

28:08.180 --> 28:12.180
but actually I think that I'm going to bypass all of them for Popocaros.

28:12.180 --> 28:18.180
Because I need an RPG on the PSP, and it's fun, it's cute, it's 2D,

28:18.180 --> 28:21.180
so actually I'm going to have that one top them.

28:21.180 --> 28:23.180
Alright, Popocaros.

28:23.180 --> 28:25.180
Loki, game of the show.

28:25.180 --> 28:29.180
I'm gonna get Weheart Katamari, that's for sure.

28:29.180 --> 28:31.180
And why is that?

28:31.180 --> 28:33.180
It's because it's Katamari, it's just fun.

28:33.180 --> 28:34.180
It's also cheap.

28:34.180 --> 28:36.180
What does the sequel offer that the first one doesn't though?

28:36.180 --> 28:38.180
Why should people run out and get it?

28:38.180 --> 28:41.180
It's more of the same game, who cares?

28:41.180 --> 28:43.180
That's why you want to get it.

28:43.180 --> 28:45.180
Everything you loved about the first game is in the second game,

28:45.180 --> 28:47.180
and it's just wackier and better.

28:47.180 --> 28:50.180
Let me help. Co-op mode as well, and some new modes as well.

28:50.180 --> 28:56.420
Who cares about that? I'm just talking about more game. You know, you finish the first game like I want more give me more

28:56.500 --> 28:58.980
So, you know this this will be cool

28:58.980 --> 28:59.860
then then time

28:59.860 --> 29:04.860
Nintendogs will be awesome and I've got to get you know animal crossing just because everyone else is gonna have it, you know

29:04.860 --> 29:06.860
and I don't want to feel left out and

29:07.740 --> 29:11.620
Yeah, I think those are probably the ones are you gonna let your puppies play with my puppies?

29:12.620 --> 29:14.740
Maybe I'm gonna call my dog bacon

29:16.060 --> 29:17.540
All right

29:17.540 --> 29:19.800
My game of the show I you know

29:19.800 --> 29:25.720
I love games that do something new that isn't just the same old crap over and over again and

29:26.200 --> 29:28.280
Bring something you know new to the table

29:28.280 --> 29:35.400
I like interactive games that help you you know do like I loved Animal Crossing 1 because you could interact with other people

29:35.960 --> 29:39.440
in unique ways, so I just love originality and

29:40.160 --> 29:44.380
And this game was just damn good-looking too, and I had fun with it

29:44.380 --> 29:45.400
I had a lot of fun with it

29:45.400 --> 29:47.800
which is something I cannot say about most games.

29:47.800 --> 29:50.560
A game of the show for me would be Nintendogs.

29:50.560 --> 29:53.800
Okay, which is odd because I'm totally not a dog person,

29:53.800 --> 29:57.200
but I loved Nintendogs, it was so cute.

29:57.200 --> 29:59.040
I'd like to discuss this stuff right here.

29:59.040 --> 29:59.880
Okay.

29:59.880 --> 30:02.560
I pulled open my little show daily magazine here,

30:02.560 --> 30:04.840
and they have won a.com awards

30:04.840 --> 30:06.480
for what they thought were the best.

30:06.480 --> 30:07.360
Sure, sure.

30:07.360 --> 30:08.200
So the game-

30:08.200 --> 30:09.680
Can I finish my thought on guest show stuff first?

30:09.680 --> 30:10.600
Well, I thought you were done.

30:10.600 --> 30:11.440
No, I'm not done.

30:11.440 --> 30:12.640
I have a runner up.

30:12.640 --> 30:14.480
You all got a runner up, I want a runner up.

30:14.480 --> 30:18.480
My runner-up would be actually Meteos, the new puzzle game that's gonna be coming out on DS.

30:18.480 --> 30:22.480
I had a lot of fun playing that in the hotel last night because we were able to,

30:22.480 --> 30:26.480
myself and my friend were able to download it off the DS download station.

30:26.480 --> 30:30.480
And we just had a lot of fun with the versus mode.

30:30.480 --> 30:33.480
I think it's finally like a really good puzzler for the DS.

30:33.480 --> 30:39.480
And it's very odd that I'm giving both the best in show, my thoughts, and runner-up to DS games

30:39.480 --> 30:42.480
when I've kind of knocked the DS quite a bit over the past few months

30:42.480 --> 30:47.520
because they've had really a crap lineup well the DS is it is true the DS is

30:47.520 --> 30:53.040
going to get a hell of a lot better over the next nine months and you know if you

30:53.040 --> 30:58.760
are in the DS versus PSP mindset I still think both systems are very separate and

30:58.760 --> 31:01.720
if you really want to experience everything you're gonna have to own both

31:01.720 --> 31:06.240
but it's gonna be a close contest for those looking at one or the other okay

31:06.240 --> 31:09.080
now we can just look at it this way people you're not gonna have to actually

31:09.080 --> 31:12.960
get an external keyboard if they put Linux on the DS versus you know the PSP

31:12.960 --> 31:18.720
I had a moment of comedy though speaking of the DS stuff was trying to download

31:18.720 --> 31:28.680
electroplankton from the PSP area and having a Sony person comment on it huh

31:28.680 --> 31:35.120
all right okay yeah Logie you were gonna get into what somebody else their awards

31:35.120 --> 31:38.880
game of the show they gave it to Legend of Zelda I haven't seen the game so yeah

31:38.880 --> 31:43.880
I mean to be honest, I think our our awards quote-unquote

31:43.880 --> 31:47.960
You have to remember are from our perspective and our perspective was we were

31:48.960 --> 31:52.880
Even though you know, we're borderline media. We went in as non-media just like, you know

31:52.880 --> 31:58.960
I just like the salespeople just like the folks the students and the folks that are barely in the industry from our

31:59.260 --> 32:02.860
Perspective Legend of Zelda was not easily accessible

32:03.060 --> 32:08.840
So therefore it kind of gets a strike against it when it comes to really the most impressive thing at the show exactly

32:08.840 --> 32:15.060
best visuals unreal tournament 2007 once again another thing that you had to wait in line to go see yes, uh-huh

32:15.520 --> 32:21.120
But it looked good. Anyway, it's best game trailer. I can agree with this Mel your solid for had a learn

32:21.120 --> 32:23.380
Have a funny trailer hilarious trailer for that

32:23.960 --> 32:30.400
Best original or most original game electroplankton and I haven't played it so I couldn't tell you I wasn't able to get in on the demo

32:30.400 --> 32:36.980
But I know dark soccer you got it. It is it actually is sort of music II but yeah electroplankton is really bizarre

32:36.980 --> 32:40.900
I've been wanting that game for what was that one game that we were playing that was on the

32:42.300 --> 32:46.780
God the other system the other portable system, you know that you were hyping up

32:47.660 --> 32:52.980
Gizmondo. Yes. What was the other that game the guitar guitar game? It was called Johnny Wonder

32:52.980 --> 32:57.660
I think it was that was pretty cool. It had a little karaoke mode where you sort of

32:58.420 --> 33:05.740
You know hit directions and rhythm and it was like a music and rhythm game meets an action game, which was kind of cool

33:05.740 --> 33:10.180
You have like an action mode where you kill things by wailing part on your guitar

33:11.980 --> 33:15.360
Anyways next one so one more award, okay

33:16.180 --> 33:19.020
How about we do well?

33:19.820 --> 33:24.660
Again, this is coming from the showbook. Yeah, I'm one of comms award best show me or

33:25.300 --> 33:28.860
Best simulation game than ten dogs without a doubt all right

33:28.860 --> 33:33.660
And yeah, you can find all this stuff on one up calm or if you luckily have one of these things

33:33.660 --> 33:39.120
There's a game that they listed on here, which is cool best PC games spore, which is by will right which you know

33:39.120 --> 33:44.780
It's gonna be pretty good at PC games. I was a little disappointed that I'd really didn't see any civilization for

33:45.660 --> 33:50.000
I saw huge banners for it, but no place he could really go look at it

33:50.000 --> 33:52.220
I guess they were doing trailers and teasers

33:52.220 --> 33:55.720
But I was really hoping I'd be able to get my hands on it couldn't do it

33:56.180 --> 33:59.000
There was a civil a civilization game coming out on engage

33:59.000 --> 34:04.840
That I did get a chance to play and the graphics are nice but I couldn't figure

34:04.840 --> 34:08.920
out how to move my freaking character and to be honest I'm just done with the

34:08.920 --> 34:14.440
Engage. I have no interest in any games coming out. The Engage Arena when I walked by with

34:14.440 --> 34:20.880
Jamie it was empty. I went by it towards the beginning of the show totally empty

34:20.880 --> 34:26.520
totally empty so it's kind of sad. There was more people inside the Rockstar

34:26.520 --> 34:30.840
booth than there were in the engage arena so kind of sad but this happens

34:30.840 --> 34:35.400
all right I guess that's it you guys we're pretty much done with the show

34:35.400 --> 34:39.840
here at e3 so of course we will be back live Sunday with our three-hour talk

34:39.840 --> 34:42.960

Loki at orange launch radio.com. Yeah, nice. All right

35:36.640 --> 35:41.180
Okay, let's go around and give everybody's final thought final e3 thought Loki

35:41.840 --> 35:47.560
That pizza I had this morning wasn't cooked all the way and there will be hell to pay hell to pay. I

35:47.560 --> 35:48.920
I

35:48.920 --> 35:54.360
Had a bacon covered wiener and it was good and it was cooked in onions

35:54.480 --> 35:59.160
So it tasted like a bacon covered onion wiener and reject false icons

36:02.500 --> 36:03.520
Yet Loki yes

36:03.520 --> 36:10.680
Oh you want me my father my final thought would be that I think it's very ironic that the ferret and the orange lounge

36:10.720 --> 36:15.800
Radio media CD ended up within like a foot of each other on the giant katamari

36:15.800 --> 36:21.280
Yeah, and I wonder where they're gonna roll that thing. I was just gonna say that the Katamari claimed the ferret. Yes, so

36:22.160 --> 36:26.020
It was the retard ferret, right? No, it was the one that made all the cool sounds

36:26.800 --> 36:30.420
Apparently I made a mistake. Well, I took the one that Loki had operated on

36:30.420 --> 36:35.160
It wasn't the one you've been using on the shows because that's still in your green chair. So don't don't cry

36:38.880 --> 36:41.360
He's with the king of the cosmos now deal

36:42.400 --> 36:43.480
alright

36:43.480 --> 36:45.160
