00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:04,511
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition live at E3 Wednesday Edition.

2
00:00:06,472 --> 00:00:14,435
[SPEAKER_00]: You're tuned in to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your podcast home for all the latest video game news and gamer chat.

3
00:00:14,655 --> 00:00:18,096

4
00:00:21,513 --> 00:00:22,114
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie Summers, Dark Sakura

5
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:43,372
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, hey, the gang's all here.

6
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:48,459
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so we don't have a whole lot of time tonight because we're trying to run between doing different things, but let's get the lowdown.

7
00:00:48,819 --> 00:00:51,503
[SPEAKER_02]: Wednesday's show, let's start off with the big news.

8
00:00:52,023 --> 00:00:57,491
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of our folks out there want to know about the music games because that's how we started was with the music games, so of course we have...

9
00:00:57,851 --> 00:00:59,492
[SPEAKER_02]: Dance Dance Revolution Extreme 2.

10
00:00:59,532 --> 00:01:00,853
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, what did you think of Extreme 2?

11
00:01:01,293 --> 00:01:02,433
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was pretty cool.

12
00:01:02,954 --> 00:01:08,036
[SPEAKER_03]: The characters have been cleaned up quite a bit, and also there's new songs to be excited about.

13
00:01:08,056 --> 00:01:14,840
[SPEAKER_03]: A brand new song, which I cannot remember the title for the life of me, but had a nice, really kick-ass CG background to it.

14
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:16,540
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice animation.

15
00:01:17,201 --> 00:01:18,381
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a pretty cool song, too.

16
00:01:18,862 --> 00:01:22,704
[SPEAKER_03]: There was some pretty good songs shown off there for that, and...

17
00:01:24,144 --> 00:01:25,045
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

18
00:01:32,651 --> 00:01:36,213
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, Genie in a Bottle, a little weird, not Christina Aguilera.

19
00:01:36,273 --> 00:01:38,434
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a cover version, but it's there nonetheless.

20
00:01:40,175 --> 00:01:44,517
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, online play was being shown off in the demo, so that is confirmed.

21
00:01:44,537 --> 00:01:46,398
[SPEAKER_02]: It is going to be there, so that's very exciting.

22
00:01:46,458 --> 00:01:47,018
[SPEAKER_02]: That is cool.

23
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:48,839
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything else you want to point out about Xtreme 2?

24
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,820
[SPEAKER_02]: The logo looked cool.

25
00:01:51,641 --> 00:01:52,261
[SPEAKER_02]: It did, it did.

26
00:01:53,402 --> 00:01:55,543
[SPEAKER_02]: Ultramix 3, another very impressive one.

27
00:01:55,603 --> 00:01:57,604
[SPEAKER_02]: Very similar to Ultramix 2, I thought.

28
00:01:57,944 --> 00:02:01,705
[SPEAKER_02]: But with more of like a water theme as opposed to kind of what it had before.

29
00:02:01,925 --> 00:02:03,326
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's very water.

30
00:02:03,546 --> 00:02:10,788
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all like water themed as opposed to like some generic like club rave thing in Ultramix 2.

31
00:02:12,009 --> 00:02:13,109
[SPEAKER_03]: New Midi Head Remix.

32
00:02:13,169 --> 00:02:13,829
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, very cool.

33
00:02:13,889 --> 00:02:14,650
[SPEAKER_02]: New Midi Head Remix.

34
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:15,810
[SPEAKER_02]: Jelly Kiss showing up in the game.

35
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:18,171
[SPEAKER_03]: Jelly Kiss.

36
00:02:18,311 --> 00:02:20,612
[SPEAKER_02]: Butterfly making its US debut in Ultramix 3.

37
00:02:20,652 --> 00:02:21,252
[SPEAKER_02]: Butterfly.

38
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:22,292
[SPEAKER_03]: And guess what, folks?

39
00:02:22,652 --> 00:02:24,233
[SPEAKER_03]: For all those people bitching about Ultramix 2...

40
00:02:24,973 --> 00:02:26,413
[SPEAKER_02]: Sakura's in there!

41
00:02:26,433 --> 00:02:29,934
[SPEAKER_02]: Sakura made its way to Ultramix 3, as well as Daikinkai, another fan favorite.

42
00:02:29,954 --> 00:02:32,515
[SPEAKER_03]: Daikinkai made it in there, and Akuma Dracula Medley.

43
00:02:32,635 --> 00:02:37,876
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Akuma Dracula Medley, very excited about that one, I've been crazy for that one for years, so I'm excited about that.

44
00:02:37,936 --> 00:02:48,159
[SPEAKER_02]: And then of course, big news, Beatmania, it's not 2DX, they're not calling it 2DX here, but if you guys are fans of 2DX in Japan, they're bringing it over to the USA, Beatmania, here's the coolest thing about it.

45
00:02:48,837 --> 00:02:56,282
[SPEAKER_02]: If you go into five key mode, typically in Beatmania, going into five key mode will drop the last two keys of seven key mode and you just play the same thing.

46
00:02:56,662 --> 00:02:57,263
[SPEAKER_02]: Not so here.

47
00:02:57,323 --> 00:03:00,025
[SPEAKER_02]: You actually get all new five key songs.

48
00:03:00,425 --> 00:03:00,905
[SPEAKER_02]: It's awesome.

49
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:04,508
[SPEAKER_02]: So like what was the Metal Gear Solid theme was in there?

50
00:03:05,789 --> 00:03:06,369
[SPEAKER_02]: Paranoia.

51
00:03:06,869 --> 00:03:07,770
[SPEAKER_02]: Very excited about that.

52
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:08,411
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

53
00:03:22,038 --> 00:03:25,101
[SPEAKER_02]: Dancing, also coming to Karaoke Revolution.

54
00:03:25,621 --> 00:03:30,245
[SPEAKER_02]: Karaoke Revolution Party, Xbox, GameCube, and PlayStation.

55
00:03:30,425 --> 00:03:31,166
[SPEAKER_02]: Going to be on all three.

56
00:03:31,366 --> 00:03:31,706
[SPEAKER_02]: All three.

57
00:03:31,926 --> 00:03:33,908
[SPEAKER_02]: It's dancing and singing, if you want.

58
00:03:33,928 --> 00:03:35,929
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to play, but kind of crazy.

59
00:03:36,009 --> 00:03:37,190
[SPEAKER_02]: All that stuff going on on the screen at once.

60
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:41,254
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, what was really cool is, you've got to go back to Ultramix 3 here.

61
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:42,915
[SPEAKER_03]: Quest mode, that was really strange.

62
00:03:43,395 --> 00:03:48,599
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually got cities that are actual cities throughout the United States.

63
00:03:48,619 --> 00:03:48,960
[SPEAKER_03]: You go and...

64
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,082
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, what did you think of the music selections available at Konami?

65
00:04:06,341 --> 00:04:15,027
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually didn't hang around too long, but I tried to play Jelly Kiss, except my hip decided that, hey, you know, your Vicodin hasn't kicked in yet.

66
00:04:15,527 --> 00:04:19,970
[SPEAKER_04]: So I ended up having to stumble off of it, but I did play Beatmania.

67
00:04:21,371 --> 00:04:26,174
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever it was that I played was supposed to be a six star, and it was more like a one.

68
00:04:26,895 --> 00:04:30,477
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't think that they're completely up to level yet.

69
00:04:30,497 --> 00:04:32,078
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was only an E3 demo.

70
00:04:32,359 --> 00:04:35,721
[SPEAKER_04]: But I did wander around and check some of the peripherals out.

71
00:04:36,441 --> 00:04:39,142
[SPEAKER_04]: I tried the one at DDRgame.com.

72
00:04:39,942 --> 00:04:42,383
[SPEAKER_04]: And their metal pad's pretty decent, but there's a delay on it.

73
00:04:42,823 --> 00:04:43,323
[SPEAKER_04]: It's cushy.

74
00:04:43,964 --> 00:04:44,884
[SPEAKER_04]: I played Superstar.

75
00:04:44,964 --> 00:04:48,045
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, by then, my medicine had kicked in.

76
00:04:48,325 --> 00:04:51,726
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's a delay on it, I could tell, because Superstar's one of my old PA ones.

77
00:04:53,767 --> 00:04:54,467
[SPEAKER_04]: But it wasn't bad.

78
00:04:56,323 --> 00:04:57,003
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

79
00:05:18,621 --> 00:05:29,291
[SPEAKER_04]: I did talk to the rep there and he said, this is as close to a quote as I can come, he said they are going to continue to market it until there is something actually published in terms of a lawsuit.

80
00:05:30,643 --> 00:05:33,005
[SPEAKER_02]: For those curious about the lawsuit, it does not involve Red Octane.

81
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:40,632
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've read the list that DDR Freak made available, the actual printouts of the suit, Red Octane was never mentioned in it.

82
00:05:40,672 --> 00:05:42,054
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're going ahead with this release.

83
00:05:42,114 --> 00:05:44,196
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's good for us in the end.

84
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:48,260
[SPEAKER_03]: And we decided to ask them about their other games that have been posted.

85
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:49,421
[SPEAKER_03]: Guitar Hero.

86
00:05:49,481 --> 00:05:50,382
[SPEAKER_03]: Guitar Hero.

87
00:05:51,683 --> 00:05:54,445
[SPEAKER_03]: And it sounds pretty cool so far.

88
00:05:54,506 --> 00:05:56,007
[SPEAKER_03]: They had to be very vague on it.

89
00:05:56,207 --> 00:05:59,269
[SPEAKER_02]: It is going to be 5-key guitar controls, which is very exciting.

90
00:06:20,735 --> 00:06:26,162
[SPEAKER_02]: DDR with Mario was shown not at Konami though, they showed it over at Nintendo.

91
00:06:27,764 --> 00:06:30,628
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of bare bones what I saw, I didn't get to see a whole lot of it.

92
00:06:30,648 --> 00:06:34,513
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to tell you what, I played a song on Very Hard and I triple-ate it my first try.

93
00:06:34,912 --> 00:06:35,973
[SPEAKER_02]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

94
00:06:56,913 --> 00:06:58,834
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you guys ever released a drum peripheral?

95
00:06:58,854 --> 00:07:01,495
[SPEAKER_03]: And he kind of smelled where I was going with that.

96
00:07:01,555 --> 00:07:07,717
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's like, I have to be very vague on that, but we're working on something.

97
00:07:07,737 --> 00:07:09,678
[SPEAKER_02]: You get a nice we'll see from that.

98
00:07:10,158 --> 00:07:10,418
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

99
00:07:10,738 --> 00:07:15,340
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, not everybody that listens to our show is into music games, so let's talk about some of the other things we saw at the show today.

100
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,521
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe pick three highlights.

101
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:18,982
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll go around and talk about three highlights.

102
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:20,222
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura wants to start us off.

103
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:25,984
[SPEAKER_04]: I spent a lot of time at Nintendo, so I played Animal Crossing DS.

104
00:07:26,484 --> 00:07:27,185
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots of fun.

105
00:07:27,965 --> 00:07:31,208
[SPEAKER_04]: The world itself is very spherical.

106
00:07:31,929 --> 00:07:35,151
[SPEAKER_04]: You actually feel like you're walking on a small little planet.

107
00:07:35,572 --> 00:07:39,094
[SPEAKER_02]: I was very impressed because Animal Crossing DS is not just a rehashed GameCube version.

108
00:07:39,134 --> 00:07:41,656
[SPEAKER_02]: They actually went back and redid all the graphics and the interface.

109
00:07:41,897 --> 00:07:46,000
[SPEAKER_02]: And at the show, you could play against someone who was sitting in New York City.

110
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:48,242
[SPEAKER_02]: And I promised I would give a shout-out, but I forgot her name.

111
00:07:48,282 --> 00:07:48,822
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm very sorry.

112
00:07:48,842 --> 00:07:50,584
[SPEAKER_04]: I played against Charles.

113
00:07:51,284 --> 00:07:51,744
[SPEAKER_02]: The Voice of Mario.

114
00:07:51,764 --> 00:07:52,585
[SPEAKER_02]: The Voice of Mario.

115
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:53,205
[SPEAKER_02]: Mario Kart.

116
00:07:53,665 --> 00:07:54,966
[SPEAKER_04]: And he called me a lovely lady.

117
00:07:55,286 --> 00:07:56,306
[SPEAKER_04]: He doesn't know me very well.

118
00:07:56,326 --> 00:07:57,047
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.

119
00:07:57,567 --> 00:07:59,388
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when I met him last year, I said, it's a you.

120
00:08:00,288 --> 00:08:01,869
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so Animal Crossing.

121
00:08:02,549 --> 00:08:03,329
[SPEAKER_04]: It was pretty fun.

122
00:08:03,409 --> 00:08:06,411
[SPEAKER_04]: I went around twirling my umbrella, which he said I was very good at.

123
00:08:06,751 --> 00:08:10,392
[SPEAKER_04]: And then he was going around whacking everybody else with the bug catching net.

124
00:08:11,033 --> 00:08:15,855
[SPEAKER_04]: And he kept chasing the person with the pirate hat because he said it's fun to hit the pirate with the net.

125
00:08:16,863 --> 00:08:23,969
[SPEAKER_04]: and then I played Pokemon DX, I'm sorry, XD, which actually, I played it just for the plushie.

126
00:08:25,049 --> 00:08:26,330
[SPEAKER_02]: XD, like the smiley face?

127
00:08:26,371 --> 00:08:39,501
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but it was actually pretty cool, it's a big ol' RPG, and you play against all the up-to-date Pokemon, you know, it's the typical stadium style battle, but it was really cool.

128
00:08:40,194 --> 00:08:41,955
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually enjoyed it.

129
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:43,396
[SPEAKER_04]: I took a couple pictures.

130
00:08:43,876 --> 00:08:46,758
[SPEAKER_04]: I took pictures of just about everything I played except for the DS ones.

131
00:08:47,898 --> 00:08:51,020
[SPEAKER_04]: And actually, I played Nintendogs.

132
00:08:52,046 --> 00:09:21,609
[SPEAKER_04]: is a cute puppy, because you throw the frisbee, and then they sit on it, and they're stupid, and then you tap the screen, and they're like, oh, you want this, pat on the head, and then you grab it, and then, no, you can't, no, you threw this, you don't keep it anymore, I'm keeping it, says the puppy, no, no, no, no, you're going to give me, because I'm the human, no, says the puppy, I'm going to give, so you pull it out of the puppy, okay, throw it, puppy, and it's like three puppies, and so,

133
00:09:22,793 --> 00:09:24,793
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a beautiful description of Nintendogs, thank you.

134
00:09:26,094 --> 00:09:27,274
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder if they'll have them in tin cats.

135
00:09:28,454 --> 00:09:29,575
[SPEAKER_04]: I talked to the guy about it.

136
00:09:29,995 --> 00:09:31,955
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, you don't really train a cat.

137
00:09:31,975 --> 00:09:33,435
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, yeah, the cat trains you.

138
00:09:34,756 --> 00:09:35,856
[SPEAKER_04]: Human food now.

139
00:09:36,816 --> 00:09:38,617
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's your three for now, all Nintendo.

140
00:09:38,677 --> 00:09:39,097
[SPEAKER_02]: That's alright.

141
00:09:39,877 --> 00:09:44,098
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but one of the fun things was the picto-chatting with random people in the lines.

142
00:09:44,258 --> 00:09:44,698
[SPEAKER_04]: It was great.

143
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:51,005
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, speaking of random things going on in the line, we were standing next to Gary Coleman this morning and didn't even realize it.

144
00:09:51,185 --> 00:09:52,606
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Hodeo Kojima walked by.

145
00:09:52,627 --> 00:09:53,287
[SPEAKER_02]: It was so weird.

146
00:09:54,068 --> 00:09:58,372
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I stood next to that chick from G4TV.com, the one that's blonde, spiky hair.

147
00:09:58,712 --> 00:10:00,574
[SPEAKER_03]: Granted, I hate her on TV, but she's still hot.

148
00:10:01,551 --> 00:10:03,112
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just an on-air thing.

149
00:10:03,132 --> 00:10:04,693
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure she's a nice gal.

150
00:10:04,753 --> 00:10:06,494
[SPEAKER_02]: She seemed nice when I saw her.

151
00:10:06,514 --> 00:10:07,575
[SPEAKER_03]: They're all nice, I'm sure.

152
00:10:08,716 --> 00:10:10,737
[SPEAKER_03]: Fear me, I am your all-knowing host.

153
00:10:10,757 --> 00:10:11,738
[SPEAKER_02]: They're paid to be weird.

154
00:10:11,818 --> 00:10:12,819
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why we're not on TV.

155
00:10:12,859 --> 00:10:14,900
[SPEAKER_02]: We're a little too not weird for TV.

156
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,341
[SPEAKER_02]: No way, I'm not paid to be weird.

157
00:10:16,821 --> 00:10:17,662
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, anyway, anyway.

158
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:19,883
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, your three highlights for today.

159
00:10:20,023 --> 00:10:20,304
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

160
00:10:20,864 --> 00:10:30,991
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it wouldn't be a show if I didn't start off with, I don't know, let's just start off with Advent Children, which in Square Enix's,

161
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:34,153
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how they pronounce it, but it's wrong.

162
00:10:34,494 --> 00:10:35,314
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Squeenix.

163
00:10:35,474 --> 00:10:36,075
[SPEAKER_03]: We all know that.

164
00:10:36,515 --> 00:10:48,645
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, in their little rehashed movie thing that they did last year, they have new footage of Advent Children and... Latifah fighting in the cathedral.

165
00:10:49,606 --> 00:10:50,466
[SPEAKER_03]: Hot.

166
00:10:51,387 --> 00:10:52,268
[SPEAKER_03]: Freaking hot.

167
00:10:52,648 --> 00:10:58,293
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I know that stuff's going to be on GameSpot later, and I'm sure they're going to have a video for it.

168
00:10:58,653 --> 00:10:59,313
[SPEAKER_03]: Watch it.

169
00:11:00,474 --> 00:11:01,255
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, very hot.

170
00:11:01,555 --> 00:11:02,295
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, so they have that.

171
00:11:02,315 --> 00:11:02,855
[SPEAKER_03]: That was cool.

172
00:11:04,316 --> 00:11:12,741
[SPEAKER_03]: The second thing that I actually got to do, which was kind of neat, is I got to try out We Love Katamari, and that was a lot of fun.

173
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:14,051
[SPEAKER_03]: I played that too!

174
00:11:14,071 --> 00:11:14,992
[SPEAKER_03]: I picked up the flowers.

175
00:11:15,032 --> 00:11:17,715
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it just Mirrors the King's Package even bigger?

176
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:34,546
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, but it was pretty funny.

177
00:11:35,447 --> 00:11:39,092
[SPEAKER_03]: Then they had... What else did they play that was really cool?

178
00:11:39,773 --> 00:11:45,560
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, well, I got to try a little bit of... I can't remember what the title is.

179
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,922
[SPEAKER_03]: I can only remember the subtitle.

180
00:11:47,042 --> 00:11:47,403
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like...

181
00:11:48,893 --> 00:11:54,335
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, um, something, something, something, uh, contents under pressure.

182
00:11:54,455 --> 00:11:58,416
[SPEAKER_03]: It's that, um, tagging game where you actually spray paint buildings and stuff.

183
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:06,378
[SPEAKER_03]: I played that for a little bit, but it was weird because I was tagging stuff and all of a sudden, like, SWAT comes with guns and they start shooting at me.

184
00:12:06,418 --> 00:12:09,558
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, that's a little harsh for someone that's just tagging a building.

185
00:12:09,678 --> 00:12:10,819
[SPEAKER_04]: But Jet Set Radio does that.

186
00:12:11,219 --> 00:12:12,739
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's very similar.

187
00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:15,380
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, so I had to fight them off with a paint roller and guess what?

188
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:16,261
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura

189
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:43,112
[SPEAKER_04]: I did take a very up-close picture of one, so that'll be available soon.

190
00:12:43,132 --> 00:12:45,074
[SPEAKER_02]: As did I. I'm going to get to the mail.

191
00:12:45,174 --> 00:12:46,755
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have a question for us, hurry up.

192
00:12:46,795 --> 00:12:47,775
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to write us right now.

193
00:12:48,256 --> 00:12:53,579
[SPEAKER_02]: E3 at OrangeLoungeRadio.com And we'll be checking this box, such as these questions that came in from Sunday's show.

194
00:12:53,999 --> 00:12:55,080
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll answer these.

195
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:58,943
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have something you want us to check into on the show, remember we can't get to everything.

196
00:12:59,003 --> 00:13:01,845
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you send us a big list, we'll probably only be able to get to one or two.

197
00:13:02,145 --> 00:13:03,346
[SPEAKER_02]: But we want to try and help you guys out.

198
00:13:03,426 --> 00:13:06,348
[SPEAKER_02]: Michael N. actually wanted more information on the Game Boy Micro.

199
00:13:06,448 --> 00:13:06,928
[SPEAKER_02]: What is it?

200
00:13:07,408 --> 00:13:10,271
[SPEAKER_02]: Game Boy Micro is like a Game Boy Advance, but it's the size of your palm.

201
00:13:10,491 --> 00:13:11,232
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very small.

202
00:13:11,272 --> 00:13:12,193
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the coolest thing about it.

203
00:13:12,213 --> 00:13:17,038
[SPEAKER_02]: You know how we usually bag on Nintendo because they make you buy the same thing five different times to get it in different colors?

204
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:22,163
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the face is detachable, kind of like a car stereo, so you can actually change the face.

205
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:26,647
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a red face and a blue face and a baseball-looking face and all these strange things.

206
00:13:26,747 --> 00:13:28,609
[SPEAKER_02]: Any other impressions on the Game Boy Micro, you guys?

207
00:13:29,736 --> 00:13:30,196
[SPEAKER_04]: It's little!

208
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:33,578
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's supposed to also have, what, double the battery power, too.

209
00:13:34,499 --> 00:13:34,799
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

210
00:13:34,819 --> 00:13:37,300
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you can just keep it on indefinitely, maybe?

211
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,661
[SPEAKER_03]: The screen's, like, half the size.

212
00:13:40,482 --> 00:13:44,664
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, the Game Boy Advance games, I don't think, are that good anymore.

213
00:13:44,704 --> 00:13:47,766
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, there's nothing really Game Boy Advance that I really want.

214
00:13:48,266 --> 00:13:53,469
[SPEAKER_03]: I noticed, though, it's slightly larger than, say, a Game Boy Advance cartridge.

215
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:55,931
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, maybe a bit larger than that, but...

216
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,482
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, it looks like a cell phone screen.

217
00:13:59,223 --> 00:14:03,266
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, and really... It does, it looks like playing it on a cell phone.

218
00:14:03,286 --> 00:14:08,852
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, it's like if I had a Game Boy Advance SP or original Game Boy Advance, I wouldn't really buy this.

219
00:14:09,012 --> 00:14:10,013
[SPEAKER_03]: It's cute though, it's cute.

220
00:14:10,033 --> 00:14:15,157
[SPEAKER_03]: It's cute, but it's like, really, I mean, Game Boy Advance SP, it pretty much fits in your pocket.

221
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:18,961
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you really need, I mean, hell, a DS fits in my pocket, so...

222
00:14:19,841 --> 00:14:20,722
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, voice over IP chat.

223
00:14:40,976 --> 00:14:41,757
[SPEAKER_04]: There was that too.

224
00:14:42,498 --> 00:14:47,083
[SPEAKER_04]: Which actually, if anyone's ever seen the commercial, the Cisco commercials, where they have the U.S.

225
00:14:47,123 --> 00:14:50,246
[SPEAKER_04]: marketing team and the Japanese marketing team and they're playing, they put this phone back on there.

226
00:14:50,487 --> 00:14:51,568
[SPEAKER_04]: I used to use that phone at work.

227
00:14:51,968 --> 00:14:58,916
[SPEAKER_04]: It uses your internet line as your phone line, almost kind of like our Skype does, similarly, except it's carried over an internet signal.

228
00:15:00,539 --> 00:15:09,361
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, Jin sent us a really big list, and, um, I think actually it's Jin4576, I apologize if I screwed up your number, 4576 I think, but, uh, who cares, it's Jin, it's awesome.

229
00:15:09,681 --> 00:15:11,761
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, SoulCalibur3, create a character.

230
00:15:12,061 --> 00:15:18,042
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the demo was a little skimpy, we only saw Mitsuru Yugi versus one of the new characters, one with a giant chakra, I can't remember her name.

231
00:15:18,362 --> 00:15:24,303
[SPEAKER_02]: T, I'm really sorry guys, I don't cheat, I don't use papers, I've got, I think it was Tina or Tira, something.

232
00:15:24,603 --> 00:15:28,104
[SPEAKER_02]: They were the only two playable ones in the demo, didn't see a lot of created characters, sorry to say.

233
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:29,624
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully we'll know more information on that soon.

234
00:15:30,224 --> 00:15:34,686
[SPEAKER_02]: One more information also on Final Fantasy XII, CG looks amazing.

235
00:15:34,786 --> 00:15:37,648
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they went back and retooled it because it looks like Advent Children.

236
00:15:38,828 --> 00:15:41,670
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that what they're going to be doing is release it for the PS3.

237
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:43,291
[SPEAKER_03]: That's our thought.

238
00:15:43,351 --> 00:15:50,194
[SPEAKER_02]: That's our thought is that because they weren't showing playable versions of it, but we don't want to start rumors, but we think it almost looks too good to be on PS2.

239
00:15:51,395 --> 00:15:52,315
[SPEAKER_04]: Either that or it's dev kit.

240
00:15:54,005 --> 00:15:54,906
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

241
00:16:12,145 --> 00:16:13,968
[SPEAKER_02]: I also saw the classroom one which is pretty cool

242
00:16:27,368 --> 00:16:30,651
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, we do have to wrap things up pretty soon here, but any other thoughts?

243
00:16:30,671 --> 00:16:32,433
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to touch on one more thing Katamari-related.

244
00:16:32,793 --> 00:16:48,306
[SPEAKER_03]: We saw the giant Katamari that they had there, and it was funny because one of the things that someone had stuck on there is, I don't know if anyone's heard about this, for the Nintendo DS, they had, you know, touching is good thing, and you can actually send in to get your own, you know, mannequin hand.

245
00:16:48,526 --> 00:16:52,830
[SPEAKER_03]: And someone had put the mannequin hand on the large Katamari, and that was hilarious.

246
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:57,112
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so if you guys have any other E3 questions, E3 at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

247
00:16:57,152 --> 00:16:59,012
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, before we go, just one other thing real quick.

248
00:16:59,072 --> 00:16:59,933
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, DarkSakura has a thought.

249
00:17:01,033 --> 00:17:05,995
[SPEAKER_04]: Xtango has more stuff in it and looks awesome, and they are in talks with developers this year.

250
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:07,650
[SPEAKER_02]: I missed that.

251
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:08,791
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope to check that one out tomorrow.

252
00:17:08,811 --> 00:17:10,211
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw it briefly as I walked past.

253
00:17:10,231 --> 00:17:11,591
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, ooh, Xtango's here.

254
00:17:12,312 --> 00:17:14,772
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't get to spend a lot of time on West Hall or Kenshi today.

255
00:17:14,792 --> 00:17:15,773
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hoping to spend more time there.

256
00:17:15,933 --> 00:17:20,694
[SPEAKER_02]: No, yeah, I know, and I missed it completely somehow.

257
00:17:20,854 --> 00:17:21,174
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

258
00:17:21,274 --> 00:17:29,817
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just want to go through the thing you were most looking forward to that maybe disappointed you a little bit, because I have something on the top of my mind, and that would be the Nintendo DS download station.

259
00:17:30,397 --> 00:17:36,760
[SPEAKER_02]: I was really looking forward to it, but it was hammered with people, and the rooms were full, and it was hard to get anything on there.

260
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,881
[SPEAKER_02]: But I just went and sat down and used the DSs they had there.

261
00:17:41,482 --> 00:17:43,723
[SPEAKER_02]: And I did get to play Meteos, which was very cool.

262
00:17:43,883 --> 00:17:46,584
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sad I didn't get to hear the music, though, because I hear the music's very cool.

263
00:17:46,824 --> 00:17:49,285
[SPEAKER_02]: But the game itself, simple yet addicting.

264
00:17:50,245 --> 00:17:51,846
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking forward to playing this one in more detail.

265
00:17:52,246 --> 00:17:55,047
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys have any thoughts, things you were looking forward to that maybe disappointed you a little bit?

266
00:17:57,108 --> 00:17:59,169
[SPEAKER_04]: I went in with no expectations, and they were met.

267
00:18:00,427 --> 00:18:01,147
[SPEAKER_02]: Rockstar's Booth

268
00:18:25,781 --> 00:18:27,262
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, I'm very disappointed on swag.

269
00:18:27,282 --> 00:18:28,343
[SPEAKER_03]: Not a lot of swag this year.

270
00:18:28,363 --> 00:18:32,545
[SPEAKER_03]: I beg to differ, because I have Pokemon, and I have t-shirts, and I have press kits, and I have puppies.

271
00:18:51,644 --> 00:19:01,112
[SPEAKER_03]: and also big disappointment to Sony and Nintendo for constantly tripping the breakers there and causing power outages in their little hall there.

272
00:19:01,352 --> 00:19:04,815
[SPEAKER_02]: And also kind of a thumbs down to people wanting you to wait in line for their show.

273
00:19:04,915 --> 00:19:06,957
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's got a line and it's a half hour long.

274
00:19:07,077 --> 00:19:07,417
[SPEAKER_02]: Too bad.

275
00:19:08,109 --> 00:19:09,029
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

276
00:19:22,489 --> 00:19:23,650
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, we're going to wrap it up here.

277
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:25,351
[SPEAKER_02]: Final thoughts, you guys.

278
00:19:25,391 --> 00:19:25,611
[SPEAKER_02]: Matt?

279
00:19:26,772 --> 00:19:35,838
[SPEAKER_03]: Tomorrow, I'm going to wait in line for Nintendo, and I'm waiting in line to see the PS3, and Xbox can suck it, because in order to play their game, you have to be media.

280
00:19:36,158 --> 00:19:39,200
[SPEAKER_03]: But you can look down upon it on a wonderful platform.

281
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,061
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, to hell with them.

282
00:19:40,321 --> 00:19:40,681
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

283
00:19:40,901 --> 00:19:45,004
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not buying your stupid Xbox 360, so you can shove it, okay?

284
00:19:45,024 --> 00:19:46,445
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I ain't buying that crap.

285
00:19:46,505 --> 00:19:47,566
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care how good it looks.

286
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:49,647
[SPEAKER_03]: Views and opinions expressed of Loki do not necessarily...

287
00:19:49,767 --> 00:19:51,688
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, also, the new console systems are ugly.

288
00:19:51,988 --> 00:19:53,209
[SPEAKER_03]: Except for the Xbox 360.

289
00:19:53,289 --> 00:19:54,290
[SPEAKER_03]: There's irony for ya.

290
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:58,452
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, the Xbox 360 show that they did was freaking pretty.

291
00:19:58,812 --> 00:20:00,113
[SPEAKER_04]: Quake 4, ha ha ha ha.

292
00:20:00,373 --> 00:20:01,674
[SPEAKER_04]: Dead or Alive 4, ha ha ha.

293
00:20:02,174 --> 00:20:06,477
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, if I were a man, I would have walked around the whole rest of the con with a big boner the whole time.

294
00:20:07,237 --> 00:20:08,458
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm not.

295
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:13,661
[SPEAKER_04]: But my final thought is, I'm kind of pissed off that they wouldn't let me put a Reject False Icon sticker on the Katamari.

296
00:20:15,142 --> 00:20:15,802
[SPEAKER_02]: Aw, that stinks.

297
00:20:16,611 --> 00:20:19,854
[SPEAKER_02]: My final thought is Sony and I are spending some quality time together tomorrow.

298
00:20:20,854 --> 00:20:21,175
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

299

304
00:20:33,383 --> 00:20:33,643

306
00:20:34,284 --> 00:20:34,544

308
00:20:36,994 --> 00:20:40,596
