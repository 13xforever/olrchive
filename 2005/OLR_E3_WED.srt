Okay, we don't have a fancy introduction tonight, we're just gonna kind of roll into things and get started

00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,880
We did promise you guys we're gonna give you guys some live updates from e3

6
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:34,360
My name is Rob Roberts. You might know me as sky joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts starting off with Loki

7
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:41,540
Hi, I'm here and my feet hurt like crazy. I know the feeling walking around all day also with us Jamie Summers dark Sakura

8
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:43,360
Hey, hey, the gang's all here

9
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:43,980
All right

10
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:47,120
So we don't have a whole lot of time tonight because we're trying to run between doing different things

11
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,540
But let's get the lowdown Wednesday show

12
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,020
Let's start off with the big news a lot of our folks out there

13
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:56,500
Want to know about the music games because that's how we started was with the music game

14
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:59,540
So, of course, we have Dance Dance Revolution Xtreme 2.

15
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:01,180
Loki, would you think of Xtreme 2?

16
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:02,940
I thought it was pretty cool.

17
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:07,100
The characters have been cleaned up quite a bit, and also there's, you know, new songs

18
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,100
to be excited about.

19
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:12,860
A brand new song, which I cannot remember the title for the life of me, but had a nice,

20
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:15,820
really kick-ass CG background to it.

21
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:16,820
Nice animation.

22
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:18,940
It was a pretty cool song, too.

23
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:25,140
There was some pretty good songs shown off there for that, and they, I don't know, looked

24
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:26,140
pretty nice.

25
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:29,860
tell you Erotic in the Heat of the Night is there so that's gonna be pretty cool

26
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:34,380
for the US fans who have been wanting to see Erotic for some time. Also Genie in a Bottle, little

27
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:40,460
weird, not Christina Aguilera, it's a cover version but it's there nonetheless. Also

28
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:44,980
online play was being shown off in the demo so that is confirmed it is going to

29
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:52,300
be there so that's very exciting. That is cool. Anything else you want to point out about Xtreme 2? The logo looked cool. It did, it did.

30
00:01:52,300 --> 00:02:01,300
Ultramix 3, another very impressive one. Very similar to Ultramix 2, I thought, but with more of like a water theme as opposed to kind of what it had before.

31
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:10,300
Yeah, it's very water, it's all like water themed, as opposed to like some generic like club rave thing in Ultramix 2.

32
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,300
New Midihead Remix.

33
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,300
Yeah, very cool. New Midihead Remix, Jelly Kiss, showing up in the game.

34
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,300
Jelly Kiss, and...

35
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:20,300
Butterfly, making its US debut in Ultramix 3.

36
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,300
Ultra Mix 3.

37
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:25,820
Butterfly and guess what folks, for all those people bitching about Ultra Mix 2, Sakura's

38
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:26,820
in there!

39
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:29,900
Sakura made it's way to Ultra Mix 3, as well as Daikonkai, another fan favorite.

40
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,540
Daikonkai made it in there, and Akuma Dracula Medley.

41
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:36,900
Yeah, Akuma Dracula Medley, very excited about that one, I've been crazy for that one for

42
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,020
years, so I'm excited about that.

43
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:42,900
And then of course, big news, Beatmania, it's not 2DX, they're not calling it 2DX here,

44
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:47,180
but if you guys are fans of 2DX in Japan, they're bringing it over to the USA, Beatmania,

45
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:48,860
here's the coolest thing about it.

46
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:53,800
If you go into 5 key mode, typically in Beatmania, dropping, going into 5 key mode will drop

47
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,780
the last 2 keys in 7 key mode and you just play the same thing.

48
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:57,780
Not so here.

49
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,480
You actually get all new 5 key songs.

50
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,480
It's awesome.

51
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:07,020
So like Metal, what was the Metal Gear Solid theme was in there, the Solid Snake, Paranoia.

52
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,020
Very excited about that.

53
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:10,580
I didn't get to play it because I suck at Beatmania.

54
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:11,580
That's alright.

55
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:14,740
They had headphones there so you could at least hear the stuff because it's like in

56
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:17,920
their Club Revolution section there.

57
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,400
fucking loud because they have this giant speaker right there so it sucked

58
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:26,700
dancing also coming to karaoke revolution karaoke revolution party

59
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:33,000
xbox gamecube and PlayStation gonna be on all three all three it's dancing and

60
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,440
singing if you want you don't have to play but kind of crazy all that stuff

61
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:40,980
going on the screen one that was really cool is you gotta go back to Ultramix 3

62
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:45,600
here quest mode that was really strange it's actually got like you know cities

63
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:51,000
You know that are you know actual cities throughout the United States you go and come you go through the capitals of the USA

64
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,620
We start off in Sacramento right where we're based. I like that. I love that yes very cool

65
00:03:55,620 --> 00:04:01,040
And they have super deformed heads and super deformed emmy head. That's cool. We'll have pictures on our website orange

66
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,000
I was ready to calm very soon um dark soccer. What do you think of the music selections available Konami?

67
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:12,900
I actually I didn't hang around too long, but I did I tried to play jelly kiss except my hip decided

68
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:19,860
But hey, you know your Viking hasn't kicked in yet. So I ended up having to stumble off of it, but I did play beat mania

69
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:25,940
Whatever it was that I played was supposed to be a six star and it was more like a one

70
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,920
So I don't think that they're completely up to

71
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:39,300
But I I did wander around and check some of the peripherals out is that tried the one at DDR game calm and

72
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,500
and their metal pad's pretty decent, but there's a delay on it.

73
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:47,300
It's cushy! I played Superstar. Actually, by then, mine was when it kicked in.

74
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:51,900
But there's a delay on it, I can tell, because you know, Superstar's one of my old PA ones.

75
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:56,100
And, eh, the video wasn't bad.

76
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:59,380
Speaking of peripherals, we got a chance to check out Red Octane's booth, and they were

77
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:02,380
showing off their afterburner pad, but kind of funny enough, they did not

78
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:05,980
have any games on display. They were showing in the groove. They're still

79
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:08,860
showing off in the groove, and for those wondering about the lawsuit, is it gonna

80
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:13,100
affect the release we were told no in the groove will come out home release

81
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:16,460
mid-june mid-june it's being pushed back to mid-june but it is coming out

82
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:19,460
that's what games are games are always pushed around I did talk to the rep

83
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:24,220
there and he said this is as close to quote as I can come

84
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:26,940
he said they're going to continue to market it until there's something

85
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:31,900
actually published in terms of a lawsuit for those curious about the lawsuit it

86
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:35,220
does not involve red octane if you if you've read the list on the DDR free

87
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:40,420
made available the actual printouts of the suit. Red Octane was never mentioned

88
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:44,040
in it so they're going ahead with this release so it's it's good for us in the

89
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:48,180
end. And we decided to ask them about their other games that have been posted.

90
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:55,340
Guitar Hero. Guitar Hero and it sounds pretty cool so far they had to be very

91
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:59,220
vague on it. It is gonna be five key guitar controls which is very exciting.

92
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:06,460
from what I heard someone played it and there's a whammy bar and sort of from

93
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:12,780
the way the notes sound like it's kind of like anyone remembers well of course

94
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:16,420
everyone remembers like amplitude or something like that where the notes kind

95
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:21,980
of come towards you same same idea so honestly if you're a music game fan this

96
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:25,280
was the year for you DER with Mario was shown not a Konami though they showed it

97
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:30,560
over at Nintendo. Kind of bare bones what I saw. I didn't get to see a whole lot of

98
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,360
it. I'm going to tell you what, I played a song on Very Hard and I triple-a'd it my first

99
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:38,600
try. So the timing window's really big. But let's face it, DDR Mario is for kids. It's

100
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:44,240
not going to be for the hardcore folks. It's to make it more kid accessible. I had a good

101
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,460
time with it. There was a lot of Mario remixes. No licensed songs I saw in it, just a bunch

102
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:48,880
of remixed Nintendo tunes.

103
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:55,880
I also asked the Red Octane people if, you know, they have a guitar peripheral.

104
00:06:55,880 --> 00:07:00,480
I'm like, have you guys ever released a drum peripheral and you kinda smelled where I was,

105
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,480
you know, going with that?

106
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:07,120
And he's like, well I can't be, I have to be very vague on that, but we'll, we're working

107
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,120
on something.

108
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,080
You get a nice we'll see from that.

109
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,480
Alright, now, not everybody that listens to our shows is into music games, so let's talk

110
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,600
about some of the other things we saw at the show today.

111
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:19,180
like pick three highlights we'll go around talk about three highlights dark

112
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:24,500
soccer wants to start us off I spent a lot of time at Nintendo so I played

113
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:31,980
Animal Crossing DS lots of fun it has the world itself is very spherical you

114
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:36,180
actually feel like you're walking on a small little planet I was very impressed

115
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:39,540
because Animal Crossing DS is not just a rehashed GameCube version they actually

116
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:43,460
went back and redid all the graphics and the interface and at the show you could

117
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:47,020
play against someone who is sitting in New York City and I promised I would

118
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:50,420
give a shout out but I forgot her name I'm very sorry I played against Charles

119
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:57,740
the voice of Mario Mario Kart and he called me a lovely lady awesome you know

120
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:01,860
when I met him last year I said it's a you all right what so Animal Crossing

121
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:05,820
what and it was pretty fun I went around twirling my umbrella which he said I was

122
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:08,980
very good at and then he was going around whacking everybody else with the

123
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:13,060
with the bug catching that says he's like any cat chasing the person with the

124
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:17,400
Pirate hat cuz he said it's fun to hit the pirate with the net and then I played

125
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:20,840
Pokemon DX. I'm sorry XD

126
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:23,780
Which actually I played it just for the plushie

127
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,940
XD like the smiley face. Yeah, like

128
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:31,820
But it was actually pretty cool. It's a it's a big old big old RPG and

129
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:37,160
You play against all the up-to-date Pokemon, you know, it's you know, the typical stadium style

130
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:41,000
Battle, but it was really cool. I actually enjoyed it

131
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,660
Um, I took a couple pictures. I took pictures about everything. I played except for the DS ones

132
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:50,900
And actually I played Nintendogs

133
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:58,780
He's a good puppy cuz you do the the frisbee and then they they sit on it and they're stupid and then you tap the screen

134
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:00,780
Oh, you want this?

135
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:07,260
Pat on the head and then you grab it and then no you can't know you through this you don't keep it anymore

136
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:14,320
I'm keeping it says the puppy. No, no, no, you're going to give me cuz I'm no says the puppy

137
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,320
I'm going to pull it out

138
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,040
That's a beautiful description of Nintendogs, thank you. I

139
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:31,960
Wonder if they'll have been 10 cats. I talked to the guy about it. He's like you don't really train a cat

140
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,960
I was like, yeah the cat trains you

141
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,440
human food now

142
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:39,080
So that's your three for now all Nintendo, that's all right

143
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:44,680
Yeah, but one of the fun things is though picked her chatting with random people in the lines. It was great

144
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,840
Dude, speaking of random things going on in the line

145
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:52,560
We were standing next to Gary Coleman this morning and like didn't even realize it and then Hideo Kojima walked by

146
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:59,040
It was so weird like and then I stood next to that chick from g4 TV comm the one that's blonde spiky here granted

147
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,040
I hate her crazy, but she's still hot

148
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:06,360
You know, it's just an on-air thing. I'm sure she's nice gal. All right, she seemed nice when I saw her

149
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:12,760
They're all nice, I'm sure. You know, fear me. I am, you all-knowing host. They're paid to be weird, that's why we're not on TV.

150
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:17,480
We're a little too not weird for TV. I'm paid to be- no, wait, I'm not paid to be weird. All right. Anyway, anyway

151
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,200
Loki, your three highlights for today. Okay. Well, it would be, you know,

152
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:29,040
it wouldn't be a show if I didn't start off with, like, I don't know. Let's just start off with Advent Children, which in

153
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:35,680
Square Enix's that's how they pronounce it but it's wrong it's Gweenix we all

154
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:41,320
know that anyways in their and their little rehashed movie thing that they

155
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:47,600
did last year they have you know new footage of Advent Children and teeth of

156
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:54,360
fighting in the Cathedral hot oh freaking hot I mean I know that stuff's

157
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:58,280
gonna be on GameSpot later and I'm sure they're gonna have you know video for it

158
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:02,740
Watch it. Oh, oh very hot. Anyway, so they have that that was cool

159
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:08,920
The second thing that I actually got to do which is kind of neat. I got the tryouts

160
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:12,640
We love katamari and that was a lot of fun

161
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,720
That's you. Oh, it's so much fun. And you just I picked up the flowers

162
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,240
It's everything that you know

163
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:25,800
The old katamari was and it's just better and with the same humor the same great graphics

164
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:30,800
and it's just a lot of fun still so it just mirrors the king's package even

165
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:38,080
bigger I don't know but it was pretty funny then they had what else did I play

166
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:44,160
that was really cool oh well I got to try a little bit of and I can't remember

167
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:51,400
what the title is I can only remember the subtitle it's like something

168
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:56,600
something something contents under pressure it's that tagging game where

169
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,880
you actually spray paint buildings and stuff I played that for a little bit but

170
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:05,260
it was weird because I was tagging stuff and all sudden like SWAT comes with guns

171
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:08,480
and they start shooting at me I'm like that's a little harsh for someone that's

172
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,560
just tagging a building but just that radio does that well it's very similar

173
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,240
and then so I had to fight them off of the paint roller and guess what guns are

174
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,960
stronger than paint rollers so it didn't worked out too well you can't kill SWAT

175
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:26,160
with paint rollers. So those are the three. Oh, one more thing I would like to

176
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:31,720
interject in there. Nintendo has done it again. They want you to buy

177
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:35,660
the Game Boy Advance again. Yes, the Game Boy Micro we got to see today. Actually, I

178
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:38,560
want to get start getting to some mail and then I'll get to my three. Oh yes,

179
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:43,000
Dark Sakura. I did take a very up-close picture of one, so that'll be available soon.

180
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,840
As did I. I'm gonna get to the mail. If you have a question for us, hurry up. You

181
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:50,240
You gotta write us right now, E3 at OrangeLoungeRadio.com,

182
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,500
and we'll be checking this box, such as these questions

183
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,240
that came in from Sunday show, and we'll answer these.

184
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,420
If you have something you want us to check into on the show,

185
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,020
remember we can't get to everything,

186
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:00,260
and if you send us a big list,

187
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:02,180
we'll probably only be able to get to one or two,

188
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:03,440
but we wanna try and help you guys out.

189
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,120
Michael N. actually wanted more information

190
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,420
on the Game Boy Micro.

191
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:07,260
What is it?

192
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,100
Well, the Game Boy Micro is like a Game Boy Advance,

193
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,500
but it's the size of your palm.

194
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,340
It's very small.

195
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:12,280
This is the coolest thing about it.

196
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,600
You know how we usually bag on Nintendo,

197
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,420
because they make you buy the same thing

198
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:19,680
different times to get it in different colors. Well, the face is detachable, kind of like

199
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,560
a car stereo, so you can actually change the face and they have like a red face and a blue

200
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:27,680
face and like a baseball looking face and all these strange things. Any other impressions

201
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:32,440
on the Game Boy Micro, you guys? It's little! I mean, and it's supposed to also have double

202
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:37,320
the battery power, too. Yeah. So, you can just keep it on indefinitely, maybe? The screen's

203
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:43,920
like half the size. Honestly, the Game Boy Advance games, I don't think, are that good

204
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,800
anymore it's just there's nothing really

205
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,880
gameboy advance it what I really want I

206
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:51,940
noticed so it's slightly larger than say

207
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:54,040
a gameboy advance cartridge I mean

208
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,440
maybe a bit larger than that but it's

209
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,640
just it looks like a cell phone screen I

210
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:02,360
mean and really it doesn't look like

211
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,240
playing it on so honestly it's like if I

212
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,960
had a gameboy advance SP or original

213
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,440
game where it's I wouldn't really buy

214
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,680
this it's cute though it's kids cute but

215
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:13,320
it's like really I mean gameboy advance

216
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:18,940
SP it pretty much fits in your pocket. Do you really need I mean hell a DS fits in my pocket, so

217
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:25,600
Okay, um let's move on. I want to get some questions from Desmond are had a question about Nintendo DS online

218
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,980
Um the only thing I caught on to it is that it will allow you through game spy

219
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:35,140
I think it was to play with folks around the nation Animal Crossing a Mario Kart with the two titles

220
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:38,220
They were showing for this how it works. I didn't quite catch on the day yet

221
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:41,680
I'm hopeful have more information also voiceover IP chat there was that too

222
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:46,120
which actually if anyone's ever seen the commercial the Cisco commercials where

223
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,960
they have the US marketing team and the Japanese marketing team and they're

224
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,960
playing they put this phone back on there I just use that phone at work it

225
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:55,080
uses your internet line as your phone line almost kind of like our Skype does

226
00:14:55,080 --> 00:15:01,720
similarly except it's carried over an internet signal um Jin sent us a really

227
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:05,800
big list and I think actually it's Jin four or five seven I apologize if I

228
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:09,040
screwed up your number four five seven six I think but who cares it's Jin it's

229
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:13,400
Awesome, uh Soulcalibur 3 create a character, you know, the demo was a little skimpy

230
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:18,500
We only saw Mitsuru Yugi versus one of the new characters one with a giant chakra. I can't remember her name T

231
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,720
I'm really sorry guys. I don't cheat. I don't use papers. I've got I think it was Tina or

232
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:27,480
Terra something they were the only two playable ones in the demo didn't see a lot of created characters

233
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:31,860
Sorry to say hopefully we'll know more information on that soon one more information also on Final Fantasy 12

234
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:36,740
CG looks amazing. I think they went back and retooled it because it looks like

235
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:41,860
Advent Children. And I think that what they're gonna be doing is releasing it for the PS3.

236
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:45,260
That's our thought. That's our thought is that because they weren't showing

237
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:48,580
playable versions of it we but we don't want to start rumors but we think it

238
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:54,660
almost looks too good to be on PS2. Either that or it's dev kit. Possibly I

239
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:59,740
mean we don't know. And then let's do one more mail here from Same wanted to know

240
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:02,660
more information on Pokemon which I think you kind of touched on already

241
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:07,380
Katamari also we heart Katamari which you touched on a little bit I just

242
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:11,100
wanted to say that the demo version they have was specifically for e3 and it was

243
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:14,380
great because you know just had that style in it and not has the king of

244
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:18,380
cosmos sitting cross-legged looking like a diva the mode I played you roll up as

245
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:21,820
many flowers as you can so it sounds like they have some different style

246
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:25,100
types of quests I also saw the classroom one which is pretty yeah there was a

247
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:29,620
classroom and a field one as well okay we do have to wrap things up pretty soon

248
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:35,320
soon here but we saw the giant katamari that they had there and it was funny

249
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:38,120
because one of the things that someone had stuck on there is I don't know if

250
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:41,920
anyone's heard about this for the Nintendo DS they had you know touching

251
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:47,960
is good thing and you can actually send in to get your own you know mannequin

252
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:52,360
hand and someone had put the mannequin hand on the large katamari and that was

253
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:56,280
hilarious alright so if you guys have any any other e3 questions e3 at orange

254
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:59,360
lounge radio calm now before we go just one other thing real quick Oh Dark

255
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:04,520
has a thought X tango has more stuff in it and looks awesome and they are in

256
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:08,480
talks with developers this year I miss that I hope to check that one out

257
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:13,040
tomorrow briefly as I walk past like Oh X tangos here I did I didn't get us

258
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,600
spend a lot of time on West Hall or Kenshi today I'm hoping spend more time

259
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:21,000
there I can't no I yeah I I know and I missed it it's completely somehow let's

260
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,360
see so I just want to go through thing you were most looking forward to that

261
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,760
maybe disappointed you a little bit because I have something on the top of

262
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:29,860
My mind and that would be the Nintendo DS download station

263
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,580
I was really looking forward to it

264
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:36,740
But it was it was hammered with people and the rooms were full and it was hard to get anything on there

265
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:40,860
But I was it I just went and sat down and used the DS as they had there

266
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:44,300
And I did get to play medios, which was very cool. I'm sad

267
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:47,420
I didn't get to hear the music though because I hear the music is very cool, but the game itself

268
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:51,840
Simple yet addicting. I I'm looking forward to playing this one in more detail

269
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,060
You guys have any thoughts thing you were looking forward to that maybe disappointed you a little bit

270
00:17:55,060 --> 00:18:01,620
I went in with no expectations and they were met probably smarter than me

271
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:05,100
not stars booth that was a huge disappointment because they had a bunch

272
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:08,420
of buses with logos on them and nothing playable

273
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,940
yep the I think you have to be media to get in there so we don't count podcasts

274
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:16,100
aren't real media I guess yet so we weren't able to get in there so we don't

275
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:19,860
know you know rockstar stop right sorry you know honestly rockstar and they have

276
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:23,740
a new game warriors which is I think based on that 1970 some movie with you

277
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:27,540
know Michael Beck or whatever anyways you know basically the same damn thing

278
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:32,020
all over again just another genre whatever it's it's like come on Rockstar

279
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:35,860
do something different so Rockstar gets our thumbs down of the day for not

280
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:39,220
showing and they do this all the time too they never show anything and also I'm

281
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:44,780
very disappointed on swag not a lot swag this year I beg to differ because I have

282
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:51,860
Pokemon and I have t-shirts and I have press kits and I have puppies and also

283
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:57,320
big disappointment to Sony and Nintendo for constantly tripping the breakers

284
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:02,120
there and causing power outages in their little hall there. And also kind of a

285
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:05,360
thumbs down to people wanting you to wait in line for their show. Everybody's

286
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:09,440
got a line and it's a half hour long. Too bad. Freaking thumbs up though cuz there's

287
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:13,820
a new Final Fight game, another one to add to the collection. Cuz some people

288
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:18,500
who've known me for some time, I collect versions of Final Fight. I have Final Fight

289
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:23,340
guy mighty final fight now have me a new one all right we're gonna wrap it up

290
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:28,300
here final thoughts you guys Matt tomorrow I'm gonna wait in line for

291
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:33,980
Nintendo and I'm waiting in line to see the ps3 and Xbox can suck it because in

292
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:37,860
order to play their game you have to be media but you can look down upon it on a

293
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:41,660
wonderful platform well the hell with them you know what I'm not buying your

294
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:46,820
stupid Xbox 360 so you can shove it okay cuz I am buying that crap I don't care

295
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:49,640
How good it was an opinion is expressed of low-key do not necessarily

296
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:54,280
Oh also the new console systems are ugly except for the Xbox 360 there's irony for you

297
00:19:54,600 --> 00:20:01,600
Do the Xbox 360 show that they did was freaking pretty quake for ha ha ha ha federal life for ha ha

298
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,520
You know if I were a man

299
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:07,840
I would have walked around the whole rest of the con with a big boner the whole time, but I'm not um

300
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:13,840
But my final thought is I'm kind of pissed off that they wouldn't let me put a reject false icon sticker on the Katamari oh

301
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:17,600
That stinks. My final thought is

302
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,280
Sony and I are spending some quality time together tomorrow.

303
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:25,160
Alright, from us here at E3 in LA live to you guys, thanks for tuning in and

304
