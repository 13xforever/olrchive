00:00:29,056 --> 00:00:31,157
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, Jamie Summers DarkSakura, Jamie Summers

3
00:00:57,405 --> 00:01:07,429
[SPEAKER_02]: First off, go figure, neither of the hotels we're staying at, because we're actually across two separate hotels, the three of us, neither of them have Wi-Fi access, so that does us no good there.

4
00:01:07,789 --> 00:01:15,652
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the internet cafe that is up the street from where Loki and I are staying was closed yesterday, and we were thinking, oh, we'll just upload it over there.

5
00:01:15,972 --> 00:01:16,612
[SPEAKER_02]: No, they're closed.

6
00:01:16,652 --> 00:01:21,033
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had to wait, and today we uploaded it from the E3 Business Center, so we finally got it up there.

7
00:01:21,394 --> 00:01:25,195
[SPEAKER_02]: So you guys actually won't hear this until Friday morning, so we apologize for that delay.

8
00:01:26,216 --> 00:01:33,325
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, it happens, and we're still bringing you the coverage faster than 99.9% of the other sites out there on the internet.

9
00:01:33,345 --> 00:01:34,426
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're really excited about that.

10
00:01:34,446 --> 00:01:40,874
[SPEAKER_02]: And we also want to give a big thank you to Jason, our webmaster, who is helping us out on the other end and getting these podcasts to you guys.

11
00:01:40,894 --> 00:01:41,875
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay, Jason!

12
00:01:41,895 --> 00:01:42,436
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay!

13
00:01:42,837 --> 00:01:43,117
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

14
00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:45,271
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's talk about Thursday.

15
00:01:45,331 --> 00:01:46,913
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you guys feeling after today?

16
00:01:46,993 --> 00:01:49,535
[SPEAKER_02]: Two-thirds of the showdown, only Friday to go.

17
00:01:49,876 --> 00:01:54,601
[SPEAKER_02]: Today is the longest day of E3 as well, going from 9 o'clock in the morning to 6 o'clock in the evening.

18
00:01:55,021 --> 00:01:56,503
[SPEAKER_02]: I know Loki and I were there all day.

19
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:57,845
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie, did you get there at 9 o'clock too?

20
00:01:58,886 --> 00:02:01,689
[SPEAKER_03]: Got there around 10-something actually because we went to breakfast.

21
00:02:03,683 --> 00:02:04,044
[SPEAKER_02]: Not us.

22
00:02:04,184 --> 00:02:05,505
[SPEAKER_02]: We kind of skipped breakfast.

23
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:09,569
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually ended up eating pizza at about 11.30 or so.

24
00:02:09,649 --> 00:02:10,590
[SPEAKER_02]: No, even before that.

25
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:11,931
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like 10.30 or something?

26
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:12,892
[SPEAKER_02]: It was about 10.30.

27
00:02:13,613 --> 00:02:24,644
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason behind that is if you don't eat at E3 super early in the day or super late in the day, you will be waiting in line for a long time as LankyStyle from the other show and I

28
00:02:25,044 --> 00:02:35,666
[SPEAKER_02]: found out on Wednesday we waited in line for like 45 minutes to get an $8 hamburger and fries which is like even worse quality than you'd get at Burger King.

29
00:02:36,146 --> 00:02:40,027
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's one thing if you guys are planning on going to E3 in the future.

30
00:02:40,387 --> 00:02:42,787
[SPEAKER_02]: Eat early, eat late, or sneak your food in.

31
00:02:42,807 --> 00:02:43,127
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

32
00:02:44,148 --> 00:02:44,628
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

33
00:02:44,808 --> 00:02:47,308
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually ate a hamburger too just without the bun.

34
00:02:47,508 --> 00:02:48,288
[SPEAKER_03]: She gave me two patties.

35
00:02:48,308 --> 00:02:49,689
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a cheeseburger.

36
00:02:51,049 --> 00:02:52,229
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was still $8 though, right?

37
00:02:53,735 --> 00:02:55,283
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but I got twice as much food as you did

38
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:00,563
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, I want to just say to you guys real quick, we are having another technical difficulty night.

39
00:03:00,603 --> 00:03:06,587
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually only have one microphone, so if you have a couple of clanks and weird volume things, it's just because we're passing it back and forth.

40
00:03:06,647 --> 00:03:11,871
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, we want to bring you guys the up-to-the-minute news, so we're just kind of making do with it.

41
00:03:11,991 --> 00:03:12,512
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, Loki.

42
00:03:13,612 --> 00:03:24,460
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, remember, if you're coming to E3 to buy food, bring cash, because I don't know why, but after about a couple hours after they open, they're just like, you know, we don't want to have to worry about...

43
00:03:26,744 --> 00:03:29,625
[SPEAKER_01]: doing our credit cards and whatnot.

44
00:03:29,745 --> 00:03:31,766
[SPEAKER_01]: So, to hell with it.

45
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:35,087
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're screwed because you have your food and you're like, oh, can I pay the credit?

46
00:03:35,728 --> 00:03:35,968
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

47
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:37,528
[SPEAKER_01]: Aw, crap.

48
00:03:38,909 --> 00:03:40,289
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you're stuck in that awkward moment.

49
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:41,970
[SPEAKER_01]: Luckily, I always bring cash.

50
00:03:44,229 --> 00:03:46,251
[SPEAKER_02]: Just one of the fun things.

51
00:03:47,412 --> 00:03:53,676
[SPEAKER_02]: One other thing I've got to say about all that is, you notice that around the LA Convention Center, there is no fast food whatsoever.

52
00:03:53,936 --> 00:03:56,678
[SPEAKER_02]: No McDonald's, no Burger King, within a reasonable walking distance.

53
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:57,098
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing.

54
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,261
[SPEAKER_02]: You think they do that on purpose so that you're kind of forced to eat those?

55
00:04:00,381 --> 00:04:03,843
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard they chased away a hot dog vendor today, too, that wasn't licensed.

56
00:04:04,283 --> 00:04:05,264
[SPEAKER_02]: They fear competition.

57
00:04:06,905 --> 00:04:10,688
[SPEAKER_03]: You buy their overpriced, crappy butt food.

58
00:04:12,148 --> 00:04:13,309
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, enough talk about food.

59
00:04:13,349 --> 00:04:13,949
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, guys.

60
00:04:13,969 --> 00:04:15,130
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's move on to the games.

61
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:16,751
[SPEAKER_02]: The games are what we really want to talk about.

62
00:04:17,571 --> 00:04:18,972
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do what we did yesterday.

63
00:04:19,032 --> 00:04:24,035
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about three interesting games that we saw today at E3, three things we played and enjoy.

64
00:04:24,395 --> 00:04:26,356
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go around and start with Loki, three games.

65
00:04:27,168 --> 00:04:27,648
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, no, wait.

66
00:04:27,728 --> 00:04:28,609
[SPEAKER_02]: You stole mine yesterday.

67
00:04:28,629 --> 00:04:29,469
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm starting off today.

68
00:04:30,149 --> 00:04:32,470
[SPEAKER_02]: Three games I played today that I enjoyed.

69
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:37,011
[SPEAKER_02]: First off, Castlevania DS I actually checked out today and thought it was pretty cool.

70
00:04:37,071 --> 00:04:41,093
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the way that you can kind of draw to defeat the boss.

71
00:04:41,133 --> 00:04:42,113
[SPEAKER_02]: It was kind of interesting.

72
00:04:42,673 --> 00:04:56,238
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of DS games to date, they've relied solely on the touch, I think, the touch element of the game, whereas Castlevania DS, it was a Castlevania game like you'd see on the Game Boy Advance with your map or subscreen shown at the top.

73
00:04:56,678 --> 00:04:57,779
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

74
00:05:14,233 --> 00:05:17,377
[SPEAKER_02]: Which was interesting, it was different, but some of the songs in it were really weird.

75
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:22,163
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, the song I played was Headstrong, and I don't even remember who sings that, because I don't listen to mainstream music.

76
00:05:22,563 --> 00:05:25,106
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um... Headstrong, yeah, whatever.

77
00:05:26,108 --> 00:05:28,891
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was weird to hear that in Donkey Konga, though, of all things.

78
00:05:29,432 --> 00:05:29,812
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, um...

79
00:05:32,963 --> 00:05:33,664
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to think what else.

80
00:05:33,704 --> 00:05:35,346
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yes, one pleasant surprise.

81
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:42,252
[SPEAKER_02]: The first thing I saw this morning over at Midway's booth, I played Mortal Kombat Shaolin Monks, which I wasn't sure what to expect from that.

82
00:05:42,292 --> 00:05:48,378
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was just going to be another Mortal Kombat game, but it's more like Mortal Kombat in the, I don't know if this is a fair comparison.

83
00:05:48,678 --> 00:05:53,399
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the Devil May Cry sense, where you're walking around and you're just, like, beating things up.

84
00:05:53,859 --> 00:06:03,021
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's kind of cool because if you pick up a weapon, like, in Total Mortal Kombat style, you're lobbing off heads and arms and all that fun stuff, and you get to do fatalities.

85
00:06:03,341 --> 00:06:06,082
[SPEAKER_02]: I was actually really pleasantly surprised with Mortal Kombat Shalamus.

86
00:06:06,122 --> 00:06:08,262
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually one of those few games I see that I'm like, you know what?

87
00:06:08,302 --> 00:06:09,683
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to have to buy this when it comes out.

88
00:06:10,003 --> 00:06:13,963
[SPEAKER_02]: But, of course, I've always been kind of a Mortal Kombat fan, I guess.

89
00:06:14,424 --> 00:06:15,664
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are my three.

90
00:06:15,744 --> 00:06:15,944
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki.

91
00:06:16,984 --> 00:06:18,505
[SPEAKER_01]: It was Mortal Kombat of War.

92
00:06:19,146 --> 00:06:19,987
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what it was.

93
00:06:20,367 --> 00:06:23,169
[SPEAKER_01]: Because everyone's got to do the God of War, Devil May Cry game.

94
00:06:23,309 --> 00:06:25,571
[SPEAKER_01]: Even Disney, but I haven't played that one yet.

95
00:06:26,372 --> 00:06:31,396
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that That's So Raven 2, where Raven Simones just starts coming out and kicking the crap out of everybody?

96
00:06:32,356 --> 00:06:32,797
[SPEAKER_02]: You wish.

97
00:06:32,857 --> 00:06:35,939
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that would be the Nightmare Before Christmas game.

98
00:06:38,581 --> 00:06:40,063
[SPEAKER_01]: Raven Simones and Nightmare Before Christmas?

99
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:40,163
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

100
00:06:40,703 --> 00:06:41,704
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like driving in LA for reals.

101
00:07:08,135 --> 00:07:10,237
[SPEAKER_01]: It was unclear where the hell you're supposed to be going.

102
00:07:10,297 --> 00:07:25,873
[SPEAKER_01]: You actually had to look at your map and look at these checkpoints that they had that resembled something from either, say, Grand Theft Auto during your checkpoint race missions or whatever, or Midnight Club, the original Midnight Club, where you have this beam of light coming.

103
00:07:26,534 --> 00:07:29,697
[SPEAKER_01]: So you see it off in the distance, but you're like, how the hell do I get there?

104
00:07:30,397 --> 00:07:31,678
[SPEAKER_01]: and a lot of times I got lost.

105
00:07:32,058 --> 00:07:33,818
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just not fun in that sense.

106
00:07:34,299 --> 00:07:38,640
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other annoying thing is every time you get in a high-speed car crash, they do a slow-mo instant replay.

107
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,861
[SPEAKER_01]: Annoying as hell.

108
00:07:41,201 --> 00:07:43,282
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure, ooh, it looks cool, but guess what?

109
00:07:43,362 --> 00:07:46,523
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not Burnout, so stop trying to be like Burnout, okay?

110
00:07:46,763 --> 00:07:47,263
[SPEAKER_01]: You're L.A.

111
00:07:47,343 --> 00:07:47,603
[SPEAKER_01]: Rush.

112
00:07:47,943 --> 00:07:51,145
[SPEAKER_01]: San Francisco Rush, you know, unrealistic, you know, loops and stuff.

113
00:07:51,525 --> 00:07:52,965
[SPEAKER_01]: That is what I expect from L.A.

114
00:07:53,045 --> 00:07:53,265
[SPEAKER_01]: Rush.

115
00:07:53,686 --> 00:07:54,626
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not what I got.

116
00:07:55,768 --> 00:07:56,489
[SPEAKER_01]: Shadow of the Hedgehog

117
00:08:26,189 --> 00:08:30,714
[SPEAKER_01]: I was, once again, not very impressed by the hands and feet mode.

118
00:08:30,874 --> 00:08:31,995
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it was retarded.

119
00:08:32,015 --> 00:08:34,458
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no, no.

120
00:08:34,518 --> 00:08:36,180
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just pissed off because you failed your song.

121
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:41,186
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're also pissed off that when I played in the heat of the night expert into hands and feet mode that I got a crowd.

122
00:08:41,426 --> 00:08:43,168
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, don't go there.

123
00:08:43,683 --> 00:08:45,044
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, your big three from today, Thursday

124
00:09:12,341 --> 00:09:13,563
[SPEAKER_03]: My big three.

125
00:09:13,723 --> 00:09:17,708
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm not, you know, I looked at a whole bunch of stuff.

126
00:09:18,229 --> 00:09:19,050
[SPEAKER_03]: I played a few.

127
00:09:20,212 --> 00:09:23,376
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to completely just gush over Kingdom Hearts 2.

128
00:09:24,978 --> 00:09:26,340
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it was Kingdom Hearts 2.

129
00:09:27,261 --> 00:09:28,082
[SPEAKER_03]: It was so cool.

130
00:09:28,903 --> 00:09:40,488
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, are you gushing because it's Kingdom Hearts, or are you gushing like everybody made this giant gush sound in the Squeenix show when you saw that Johnny Depp as, what was his character in Pirates of the Caribbean?

131
00:09:40,568 --> 00:09:41,928
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't see the movie, I have to be honest.

132
00:09:42,469 --> 00:09:43,189
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't get out much.

133
00:09:43,429 --> 00:09:45,650
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, thank you, Jack Sparrow is actually in Kingdom Hearts.

134
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:48,191
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody made this big gush when Jack Sparrow came on screen.

135
00:09:48,911 --> 00:09:51,472
[SPEAKER_03]: Spoiler, thank you, I was gonna go to that tomorrow.

136
00:09:55,034 --> 00:09:55,554
[SPEAKER_03]: You bitch.

137
00:09:57,386 --> 00:09:59,207
[SPEAKER_02]: It was on the internet before they showed it.

138
00:10:00,747 --> 00:10:04,288
[SPEAKER_03]: I usually spend my internet time reading world news and events, sir.

139
00:10:05,428 --> 00:10:06,129
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

140
00:10:08,409 --> 00:10:09,189
[SPEAKER_01]: It was an event.

141
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:15,191
[SPEAKER_03]: It was an event the way that me waking up in the morning and farting is an event.

142
00:10:16,932 --> 00:10:21,953
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you looking up world events like, oh no, Ben Affleck got Jennifer Garner pregnant, oh my lord.

143
00:10:22,713 --> 00:10:24,814
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's your Yahoo, not mine.

144
00:10:26,425 --> 00:10:27,646
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen your Yahoo.

145
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:31,828
[SPEAKER_03]: Your Yahoo is Britney Spears is knocked up!

146
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:37,131
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sorry, I have Ben Affleck dot com feeding right into my Yahoo.

147
00:10:37,632 --> 00:10:37,892
[SPEAKER_02]: Bitch.

148
00:10:38,532 --> 00:10:40,493
[SPEAKER_03]: My Yahoo just is depressing every day.

149
00:10:41,214 --> 00:10:42,054
[SPEAKER_03]: War!

150
00:10:42,795 --> 00:10:43,695
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, anyway.

151
00:10:46,197 --> 00:10:47,978
[SPEAKER_02]: You had to find out someday, I'm sorry.

152
00:10:48,278 --> 00:10:49,058
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

153
00:10:49,238 --> 00:10:50,079
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm making pouty faces.

154
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:51,320
[SPEAKER_03]: I was gonna find out tomorrow.

155
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:52,280
[SPEAKER_03]: Give me a dollar.

156
00:10:54,241 --> 00:10:55,162
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, anyway, anyway.

157
00:10:55,666 --> 00:11:03,271
[SPEAKER_03]: Kingdom Hearts 2 is pretty, and it's very, I mean, it's really, it retains the same graphic style.

158
00:11:03,651 --> 00:11:08,234
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's pretty much on with the last one, except you can tell it does more in subtle ways.

159
00:11:09,355 --> 00:11:10,976
[SPEAKER_03]: First of all, I have to mention this.

160
00:11:11,236 --> 00:11:12,597
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what made me really bouncy.

161
00:11:12,877 --> 00:11:14,478
[SPEAKER_03]: I went over to Squenix.

162
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:16,119
[SPEAKER_03]: No pictures!

163
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:17,160
[SPEAKER_03]: No pictures!

164
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,422
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we're gonna hide the game from the world.

165
00:11:21,443 --> 00:11:24,405
[SPEAKER_02]: And I haven't seen a single other booth say you can't take pictures.

166
00:11:25,871 --> 00:11:28,412
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, PlayStation did the same thing.

167
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:30,613
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, F them both.

168
00:11:31,773 --> 00:11:32,033
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

169
00:11:32,634 --> 00:11:35,435
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, so I trot over to Buena Vista today.

170
00:11:35,575 --> 00:11:39,276
[SPEAKER_03]: I look around, no one's there, so I start playing and take a picture.

171
00:11:39,576 --> 00:11:46,279
[SPEAKER_03]: Guy's like, I'll play for you while you take pictures and I'll show you the cool shit so you can take pictures of them.

172
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:49,628
[SPEAKER_03]: And I wanted to actually get his name and everything.

173
00:11:49,648 --> 00:11:51,830
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, no, I don't actually work for Buena Vista.

174
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:53,131
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm more of a correspondent.

175
00:11:53,211 --> 00:11:56,274
[SPEAKER_03]: So I said, I'll credit you as that nice guy at the Buena Vista booth.

176
00:11:56,314 --> 00:11:57,275
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you, nice guy.

177
00:11:59,516 --> 00:12:05,842
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, he showed me you can actually fuse with other characters in your party.

178
00:12:06,262 --> 00:12:09,285
[SPEAKER_03]: And actually, it's really cool when you fuse with Goofy because you get the valor.

179
00:12:09,305 --> 00:12:10,085
[SPEAKER_03]: Spoiler!

180
00:12:10,106 --> 00:12:10,626
That was a spoiler!

181
00:12:12,167 --> 00:12:12,568
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

182
00:12:13,548 --> 00:12:13,809
[SPEAKER_03]: Bitch.

183
00:12:15,438 --> 00:12:22,800
[SPEAKER_03]: You get the Valor, and he wears this red outfit, and he wields two Keyblades.

184
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:25,921
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was pretty cool, and he's got all this power.

185
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:32,343
[SPEAKER_03]: And he did the Mulan level, he did the level where Hades is trying to kick your ass, but the Mulan level was cool.

186
00:12:32,898 --> 00:12:36,321
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, you know the scene where, who was the bad guy in Mulan?

187
00:12:36,801 --> 00:12:37,882
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember his name.

188
00:12:38,242 --> 00:12:41,084
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, he comes over the hill and there's a few of his army there.

189
00:12:41,464 --> 00:12:42,325
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're like, oh, okay.

190
00:12:42,365 --> 00:12:42,905
[SPEAKER_03]: And they rush.

191
00:12:42,985 --> 00:12:44,907
[SPEAKER_03]: And then a bajillion of them rush over the hill.

192
00:12:45,667 --> 00:12:47,789
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, instead it was a bunch of the Heartless.

193
00:12:49,016 --> 00:13:14,524
[SPEAKER_03]: and we're talking like there were easily several hundred on the screen at that time attacking you and you just have to outlast the clock at this point but there and I've got several pictures of it they're gonna be online when we get back unless somebody is kind enough to take them back beforehand but there was just so many on screen I was really impressed I mean I

194
00:13:15,598 --> 00:13:17,002
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, we are all over the place.

195
00:13:17,122 --> 00:13:19,047
[SPEAKER_03]: We are yellow and ugly and we're trying to kick your ass.

196
00:13:19,528 --> 00:13:20,089
[SPEAKER_03]: That type of thing.

197
00:13:20,731 --> 00:13:21,753
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was really cool.

198
00:13:21,814 --> 00:13:23,919
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I got to get into one of the media events.

199
00:13:24,972 --> 00:13:31,776
[SPEAKER_03]: I got, because I went over there, because I talked about Call of Cthulhu the other night, when we did our last actual podcast.

200
00:13:31,856 --> 00:13:39,141
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I had, I found out where Bethesda was, and I was like, you know, I like, I've been looking at this Call of Cthulhu thing, and it looks pretty groovy.

201
00:13:39,621 --> 00:13:41,582
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, well, okay, come on in.

202
00:13:42,082 --> 00:13:47,846
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I sat there with the other press people, and the guy was playing through it, and I was like, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.

203
00:13:48,346 --> 00:13:55,013
[SPEAKER_03]: Call of Cthulhu looks cool, but the best thing about it, visually, it's about 80% done.

204
00:13:56,195 --> 00:13:59,779
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I got some more stats on it.

205
00:13:59,999 --> 00:14:02,402
[SPEAKER_03]: I do believe he said out in either August or September.

206
00:14:03,423 --> 00:14:04,704
[SPEAKER_03]: You have an insanity meter.

207
00:14:05,365 --> 00:14:07,988
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, the main character was a policeman who went insane.

208
00:14:08,849 --> 00:14:11,531
[SPEAKER_03]: And then he got out of the asylum and became a detective.

209
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:26,824
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, when you see shocking images, like in one scene there was a ghoul pinned to a cross in this church, or when you're being chased, your insanity level goes up.

210
00:14:27,385 --> 00:14:30,307
[SPEAKER_03]: And your screen starts getting wavy, you start getting tunnel vision.

211
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:32,149
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you hallucinate!

212
00:14:32,843 --> 00:14:38,643
[SPEAKER_03]: There's one scene where he's running down a tunnel, all of a sudden he's running through the halls of the asylum he was trapped in.

213
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:47,883
[SPEAKER_03]: Or when you enter a new scene, if your insanity level is high enough, then you get flashes of where all the enemies in the area are.

214
00:14:48,704 --> 00:14:50,324
[SPEAKER_03]: And he says there's two ways of doing each level.

215
00:14:50,364 --> 00:14:54,386
[SPEAKER_03]: You can do it the right way, the sneaky way that, you know, takes a little bit longer.

216
00:14:55,346 --> 00:14:58,007
[SPEAKER_03]: Or you can just rush through everything, guns blazing.

217
00:14:58,287 --> 00:15:01,228
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, he said that the sneaky way actually tends to be a little bit shorter.

218
00:15:01,729 --> 00:15:03,589
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'll have more information on that.

219
00:15:03,609 --> 00:15:04,650
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to do a write-up on it.

220
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:07,171
[SPEAKER_03]: You can all see it on OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

221
00:15:07,491 --> 00:15:07,911
[SPEAKER_03]: Plug, plug.

222
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:12,114
[SPEAKER_03]: and hear me gush about it on Pump Up the Volume later on.

223
00:15:13,475 --> 00:15:15,557
[SPEAKER_02]: So Kingdom Hearts 2, Call of Cthulhu, you got one more?

224
00:15:16,938 --> 00:15:18,399
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh shit, you said three, right?

225
00:15:22,342 --> 00:15:23,663
[SPEAKER_03]: The Cybersex Game!

226
00:15:25,145 --> 00:15:27,407
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, no, I didn't say that.

227
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:32,230
[SPEAKER_03]: But you guys were just funny about it.

228
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:34,112
[SPEAKER_03]: Matt was funny about it because I was like,

229
00:15:34,718 --> 00:15:38,560
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me get into the next topic, because I know we want to talk next about... Oh, wait, you thought of another one?

230
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:45,403
[SPEAKER_03]: I still have to go back and say that Shadow the Hedgehog was pretty groovy-looking.

231
00:15:46,103 --> 00:15:47,744
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no, I know what it was, my other game.

232
00:15:48,624 --> 00:15:49,745
[SPEAKER_03]: Gunstar Super Heroes.

233
00:15:50,325 --> 00:15:52,606
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's just Gunstar Heroes, and that's all.

234
00:15:54,387 --> 00:15:59,109
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well, Jamie spoiled a little bit of our next segment the most int... Spoiler!

235
00:15:59,189 --> 00:16:00,450
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my OMG!

236
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:01,310
[SPEAKER_02]: Spoiler, spoiler!

237
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:02,471
[SPEAKER_02]: Bite my ass!

238
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:08,695
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so what I want to talk about now is the most interesting moment of your E3 day.

239
00:16:08,895 --> 00:16:11,442
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll start with Loki since this got spoiled, OMG.

240
00:16:13,058 --> 00:16:14,359
[SPEAKER_01]: I was gonna talk about that?

241
00:16:14,579 --> 00:16:14,900
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, well.

242
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:22,486
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, um, yeah, so, I went to this one booth that they had there, it was right next to X-Tango, which is the game we talked about last year.

243
00:16:22,846 --> 00:16:26,089
[SPEAKER_01]: It was pretty cool, so it's a tango music game, sort of like Bust a Move.

244
00:16:26,809 --> 00:16:34,856
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, and, um, now there's this, like, cybersex game called, uh, oh man, Feel Free.

245
00:16:35,837 --> 00:16:37,658
[SPEAKER_01]: And, anyways, um, so basically...

246
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:44,881
[SPEAKER_01]: The game, I don't really know what the premise was because I only got to see it for a very brief time.

247
00:16:47,149 --> 00:16:52,992
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, basically, you had... It sort of reminded me of The Sims, but you had different things.

248
00:16:53,353 --> 00:16:56,134
[SPEAKER_01]: You were kind of controlling the girl you were talking to or something.

249
00:16:56,634 --> 00:17:01,257
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you could, like, you know, the guy would start dancing and you'd click D or whatever to make her dance.

250
00:17:01,317 --> 00:17:05,279
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you could do different, like, provocative dance stuff.

251
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:10,362
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he's like, oh, he's all... Because there's this Asian guy that spoke no English.

252
00:17:10,402 --> 00:17:13,224
[SPEAKER_01]: He's all real brief English.

253
00:17:13,444 --> 00:17:13,904
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like...

254
00:17:14,504 --> 00:17:39,631
[SPEAKER_01]: Click here to see, it takes her top off, okay, so I clicked, I clicked here, it took her top off, I'm like, oh, that's kind of cool, so he was just letting me play around with it, so I clicked their shorts, or her mini skirt, and then that came off, and then all hell broke loose, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, that's illegal, no, no, no, and then, so they had, like, someone come over to translate, and she's like, no, you can't do that, because it's, it's illegal, or something like that, I'm like, okay,

255
00:17:41,306 --> 00:17:44,548
[SPEAKER_02]: One other thing I thought was interesting about that game, and I don't remember the name of it.

256
00:17:44,588 --> 00:17:45,489
[SPEAKER_02]: Does anybody recall?

257
00:17:45,529 --> 00:17:46,630
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on my camera somewhere.

258
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:48,171
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll post more information on the site.

259
00:17:48,251 --> 00:17:49,692
[SPEAKER_02]: Field 3, I think was the name of it.

260
00:17:50,092 --> 00:17:52,134
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it Cyber Entertainment was the name of the booth, I think?

261
00:17:52,794 --> 00:17:54,796
[SPEAKER_02]: It's important, but this is the other thing.

262
00:17:55,216 --> 00:18:00,600
[SPEAKER_02]: So not only is it like a cyber sex sim, it has webcam windows in the upper left and upper right.

263
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:05,203
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can go virtual, and you can go like...

264
00:18:06,042 --> 00:18:08,745
[SPEAKER_02]: Really virtual, like, really interactive.

265
00:18:09,105 --> 00:18:13,609
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of scary because there's people that are really going to benefit from this game, and that makes me sad a bit.

266
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:18,013
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm thinking one person controls the guy, the other one controls the girl.

267
00:18:18,033 --> 00:18:19,054
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what it seems like.

268
00:18:19,274 --> 00:18:24,339
[SPEAKER_02]: You do understand when this game comes out, they're both going to be controlled by guys, whether you know it or not.

269
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,181
[SPEAKER_01]: You can tell there's the camera.

270
00:18:27,221 --> 00:18:28,142
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why they have it.

271
00:18:28,242 --> 00:18:29,563
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the dude camera.

272
00:18:30,004 --> 00:18:32,026
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing a wig and a little makeup can't hide.

273
00:18:33,616 --> 00:18:42,291
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing than holding a photo up in front of your webcam Yeah, I'll just loop this Jenna Jameson footage I taped off the TV a little while ago

274
00:18:43,993 --> 00:18:46,554
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, the most interesting thing you saw today.

275
00:18:46,574 --> 00:18:48,655
[SPEAKER_01]: Or interesting experience.

276
00:19:18,269 --> 00:19:20,569
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to play with the Katamari today.

277
00:19:21,289 --> 00:19:27,611
[SPEAKER_03]: And I got to put our media sampler on the Katamari and then you got to put the reject false icon sticker on there for me.

278
00:19:27,691 --> 00:19:29,252
[SPEAKER_03]: It made me feel like a happy fan.

279
00:19:30,532 --> 00:19:31,772
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the Katamari!

280
00:19:32,312 --> 00:19:37,834
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I got to climb all over stuff and actually get into media stuff without actually being media passes.

281
00:19:38,254 --> 00:19:38,734
[SPEAKER_03]: That was pretty cool.

282
00:19:40,456 --> 00:19:45,700
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, when I put your sticker on the Katamari, they actually gave me a Katamari Damacy 2 mouse pad.

283
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:49,302
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they gave me another one because I went back to play the game with Miklatov.

284
00:19:49,342 --> 00:19:50,403
[SPEAKER_02]: I went back to play it again later.

285
00:19:50,423 --> 00:19:51,263
[SPEAKER_02]: They gave me a second one.

286
00:19:51,584 --> 00:19:55,846
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm thinking about maybe doing a little giveaway in the near future for one of our lucky fans.

287
00:19:55,866 --> 00:19:56,227
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

288
00:19:57,488 --> 00:20:01,951
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, now that I remember, there's actually something else that I was going to say was my most interesting moment.

289
00:20:02,831 --> 00:20:03,552
[SPEAKER_03]: That was my massage.

290
00:20:05,677 --> 00:20:10,799
[SPEAKER_03]: I went out, well, I got the free one, the Tylenol Ouch booth thing, and that was all cool.

291
00:20:10,839 --> 00:20:14,900
[SPEAKER_03]: And the guy worked on my hip, you know, because I was in that car accident, and I was really in pain.

292
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:18,521
[SPEAKER_03]: But I went back after, this is about an hour after my bike had been kicked in.

293
00:20:20,202 --> 00:20:24,263
[SPEAKER_03]: But I went back and paid for like a 25-minute full massage.

294
00:20:25,103 --> 00:20:31,105
[SPEAKER_03]: And my masseur was an actual stand-up comedian.

295
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:35,193
[SPEAKER_03]: So when he was giving me my foot run, he was making me laugh.

296
00:20:35,934 --> 00:20:37,295
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to L.A., everybody.

297
00:20:39,997 --> 00:20:47,524
[SPEAKER_03]: But I like what he said, that making somebody laugh is a serious business.

298
00:20:48,525 --> 00:20:49,887
[SPEAKER_03]: And we got to talking about how...

299
00:20:52,892 --> 00:21:03,915
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but we got to a discussion on how if you live your life all stressed out and you don't laugh and you don't do anything for yourself, you're going to die, okay?

300
00:21:03,975 --> 00:21:11,217
[SPEAKER_03]: You're just going to get cancer of the lower intestine and die not able to shit on your own.

301
00:21:14,558 --> 00:21:18,599
[SPEAKER_02]: What a pleasant image to paint for all these people who are tuning in to hear the latest game news.

302
00:21:18,659 --> 00:21:19,080
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

303
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,260
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, no, no, no, no.

304
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:43,270
[SPEAKER_03]: Those of us who take time to enjoy our lives, take time to laugh, take time to play games, stress relief, have some leisurely time, those are the people who are generally going to have a happier outlook and who are going to live longer lives, at least unless a car hits them.

305
00:21:45,266 --> 00:21:47,329
[SPEAKER_02]: Point and laugh, it'll add five years to your life

306
00:22:04,403 --> 00:22:05,464
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

307
00:22:23,977 --> 00:22:26,858
[SPEAKER_02]: In some ways it's a little more fun, but it can also be a lot of work.

308
00:22:27,058 --> 00:22:28,999
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been on that side of it studying in colleges.

309
00:22:29,019 --> 00:22:29,719
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's a lot of work.

310
00:22:30,219 --> 00:22:37,362
[SPEAKER_02]: But my dad really, really likes it because he's been following the screensavers ever since it was Leo Lepore and then it transitioned and transitioned.

311
00:22:37,422 --> 00:22:38,342
[SPEAKER_02]: He's moved along with it.

312
00:22:38,382 --> 00:22:39,582
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it's this attack of the show.

313
00:22:39,622 --> 00:22:43,544
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was like, okay, my dad's really excited for me to be here.

314
00:22:43,864 --> 00:22:44,424
[SPEAKER_02]: Aw, moment.

315
00:22:44,704 --> 00:22:46,085
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to go get him an autograph.

316
00:22:46,125 --> 00:22:47,605
[SPEAKER_02]: So I went and I got him an autograph.

317
00:22:48,025 --> 00:22:53,467
[SPEAKER_02]: And I told Sarah Lane while I had him on because they were nice and they chatted up with us a little bit while we were each kind of waiting for our autograph.

318
00:22:53,823 --> 00:22:56,785
[SPEAKER_02]: And Sarah Lane asked me and said, you know, how are you?

319
00:22:56,845 --> 00:23:00,827
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, oh, fine, you know, I'm getting this from my dad, if you can make it out to him.

320
00:23:01,067 --> 00:23:04,148
[SPEAKER_02]: And he has a little bit of a crush on you, which, you know, is kind of nice.

321
00:23:04,809 --> 00:23:10,892
[SPEAKER_02]: And she goes, oh, uh-huh, well, thank you, Alan, wink wink, because that's Alan's, my dad's name.

322
00:23:11,412 --> 00:23:15,514
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, I would have been all like, dude, I swear it's not me, I'm gay.

323
00:23:15,734 --> 00:23:17,215
[SPEAKER_02]: But I didn't want to make an awkward moment.

324
00:23:17,255 --> 00:23:18,497
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it might have been an awkward moment.

325
00:23:18,637 --> 00:23:21,920
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, guys, if you're listening, because Matt ended up slipping something.

326
00:23:22,841 --> 00:23:26,504
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, your name tag doesn't say Alan.

327
00:23:27,064 --> 00:23:29,767
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, hi, Alan.

328
00:23:29,947 --> 00:23:31,569
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Alan's my stage name.

329
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:35,652
[SPEAKER_02]: I think she was just trying to be cute, so I totally respect her for that.

330
00:23:36,013 --> 00:23:40,377
[SPEAKER_02]: But, yeah, it was kind of one of those things where it's like, you know, I could...

331
00:23:41,303 --> 00:23:42,004
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

332
00:23:57,097 --> 00:24:06,713
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought G4's booth, all things considered, because they've taken a lot of heat ever since the tech TV, I thought they actually had kind of an interesting booth where you could kind of play the actual Nintendo and everything.

333
00:24:07,033 --> 00:24:09,497
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Matt ended up seizing this opportunity.

334
00:24:09,538 --> 00:24:11,381
[SPEAKER_02]: What did you do, Matt, while we were in line for that?

335
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:18,461
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you were talking to her about what Orange Lounge Radio was, so I figured I'd just help clarify.

336
00:24:19,302 --> 00:24:20,522
[SPEAKER_01]: They asked!

337
00:24:20,982 --> 00:24:32,366
[SPEAKER_01]: So, while I was having Kevin Pira and Sarah Lane signing the picture that they gave me here, I gave them one of our media samplers for our podcast.

338
00:24:32,426 --> 00:24:40,129
[SPEAKER_01]: So, hello, Kevin and Sarah, or Kevin and Sarah's interns, whoever it may be that might possibly listen to the show.

339
00:24:41,209 --> 00:24:43,351
[SPEAKER_02]: or Kevin and Sarah's trash can for all we know.

340
00:24:43,371 --> 00:24:43,951
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, who knows?

341
00:24:44,531 --> 00:24:50,115
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, the bum row machine outside the trash picking up a CD thinking it's something valuable.

342
00:24:50,415 --> 00:24:52,476
[SPEAKER_01]: No, they're really cool and the booth is pretty cool.

343
00:24:52,696 --> 00:24:59,600
[SPEAKER_01]: In the past, I've given G4 a little bit of criticism.

344
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,681
[SPEAKER_01]: But hey, really?

345
00:25:00,781 --> 00:25:04,443
[SPEAKER_01]: I figured out who the real villain of this everything is.

346
00:25:04,743 --> 00:25:09,506
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all Comcast because it's all their fault that my cable never works.

347
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:14,983
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's face it kids, we haven't said anything everyone else on the internet hasn't already said.

348
00:25:15,243 --> 00:25:16,764
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, it's just, you know, anyway.

349
00:25:17,724 --> 00:25:22,027
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and we got filmed for some TV thing too, but I don't know, I don't remember what it was.

350
00:25:22,927 --> 00:25:25,028
[SPEAKER_01]: We were filmed as bumpers for...

351
00:25:26,449 --> 00:25:27,089
[SPEAKER_01]: What was it?

352
00:25:27,129 --> 00:25:28,130
[SPEAKER_01]: G4TV.com.

353
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:37,814
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you find a rerun or happen to see G4TV.com, their E3 coverage, you will see us as a commercial intro or whatever.

354
00:25:38,215 --> 00:25:42,537
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll see us yelling and screaming because that's what we were told to do.

355
00:25:43,017 --> 00:25:49,940
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, we got to play with the 8-foot Nintendo controller that they built, which is cool.

356
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:52,761
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm dedicated now to build one that's larger.

357
00:25:52,781 --> 00:25:54,082
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

358
00:25:54,901 --> 00:25:56,222
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because I have to.

359
00:25:57,083 --> 00:25:58,904
[SPEAKER_02]: Another one of those projects you'll never finish.

360
00:25:59,084 --> 00:26:03,308
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so tomorrow is the last day of E3.

361
00:26:03,388 --> 00:26:05,109
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you guys' plans?

362
00:26:05,149 --> 00:26:07,812
[SPEAKER_02]: Something you definitely have to check out tomorrow at E3 with the last day.

363
00:26:08,873 --> 00:26:10,514
[SPEAKER_03]: Sitting in the Sony line for three hours.

364
00:26:12,042 --> 00:26:12,823
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

365
00:26:30,163 --> 00:26:33,905
[SPEAKER_02]: And I realize, you know, a lot of folks are like, boy, E3 is so glamorous.

366
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:35,705
[SPEAKER_02]: You get to play all the latest and greatest games.

367
00:26:35,945 --> 00:26:36,606
[SPEAKER_02]: And don't get me wrong.

368
00:26:36,666 --> 00:26:37,306
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty cool.

369
00:26:37,326 --> 00:26:40,327
[SPEAKER_02]: We're very lucky to be able to go to E3 and we're having a good time overall.

370
00:26:40,367 --> 00:26:43,729
[SPEAKER_02]: But to play the really good stuff, you guys, it's like going to Disneyland.

371
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:49,591
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to ride the nice ride, you got to sit in line for three hours and, you know, for that five minute thrill.

372
00:26:49,631 --> 00:26:51,712
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of, you know, too bad.

373
00:26:52,837 --> 00:27:01,507
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still going to be getting up at 7 and trying to be over there by, well, they start at 9.

374
00:27:02,308 --> 00:27:04,050
[SPEAKER_03]: Try to be over there by like a quarter till.

375
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:08,696
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think you're most looking forward to doing tomorrow, Loki?

376
00:27:10,287 --> 00:27:12,108
[SPEAKER_01]: Going home, to be honest.

377
00:27:12,649 --> 00:27:15,191
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, honestly, I'm done with the show right now.

378
00:27:16,491 --> 00:27:19,974
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought the whole line at Nintendo's booth was to see the revolution.

379
00:27:20,194 --> 00:27:23,817
[SPEAKER_01]: Then when I found out it's just to play the stupid Zelda game, I was like, ah, the hell with that.

380
00:27:23,917 --> 00:27:24,777
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not staying there.

381
00:27:25,238 --> 00:27:27,679
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll go see Sony because at least they're going to show the PS3.

382
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:31,402
[SPEAKER_01]: Nintendo, oh, wow, you show us your ugly system, but nothing that does.

383
00:27:31,903 --> 00:27:37,507
[SPEAKER_01]: You hype it up and you don't come through and say, here's a little Game Boy Advance.

384
00:27:37,607 --> 00:27:38,307
[SPEAKER_01]: Come play it.

385
00:27:38,407 --> 00:27:39,228
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, ugh.

386
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:49,793
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to kind of retract something I said yesterday.

387
00:27:49,853 --> 00:27:53,175
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually got the DS download thing in Nintendo to work better for me today.

388
00:27:53,275 --> 00:27:56,157
[SPEAKER_02]: And I still have Meteos on my DS because I put it in sleep mode.

389
00:27:56,417 --> 00:27:57,277
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of cool.

390
00:27:57,317 --> 00:27:59,398
[SPEAKER_02]: So I feel a little better about the DS download thing now.

391
00:28:00,479 --> 00:28:02,940
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to have to go back then and get Electroplankton.

392
00:28:04,021 --> 00:28:04,581
[SPEAKER_03]: Electroplankton.

393
00:28:06,044 --> 00:28:07,925
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, no one would make E3 a lot better.

394
00:28:08,266 --> 00:28:09,807
[SPEAKER_01]: It would make it harder to get into.

395
00:28:10,427 --> 00:28:13,970
[SPEAKER_01]: Because everybody is just coming in no matter what.

396
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:20,035
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people that are sort of in the industry, those are the people that are coming in.

397
00:28:20,755 --> 00:28:27,860
[SPEAKER_01]: Granted, we are sort of in the industry, but there are some people that really are like, I work for Kmart.

398
00:28:28,281 --> 00:28:29,642
[SPEAKER_01]: Kmart sells video games.

399
00:28:29,782 --> 00:28:30,943
[SPEAKER_01]: Therefore, I get in.

400
00:28:30,963 --> 00:28:31,243
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

401
00:28:31,969 --> 00:28:32,649
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

402
00:28:52,734 --> 00:28:53,054
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

403
00:29:13,917 --> 00:29:41,162
[SPEAKER_01]: which is dumb, I mean, like, I don't even understand some of these smaller companies, like, you know, for example, oh, who's the company that does, not Crave, but, like, it's just like some of the stuff in Kentia Hall, you know, you can't even see the company stuff because it's just in, behind these closed doors and stuff, it's like, oh, wow, you know, I figure, I'd figure, yeah, Gravity, for example, I'd figure a small company like that, I'd be like, hey, check out our stuff, come and check out our stuff,

404
00:29:41,642 --> 00:29:48,591
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, whereas you got cocky people like Rockstar M that, you know, they're just like, ah, our stuff is too good for you.

405
00:29:49,032 --> 00:29:52,656
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see it and you'll buy it when it comes out the end, you know.

406
00:29:52,856 --> 00:29:54,619
[SPEAKER_01]: And to be honest, that is the truth.

407
00:29:54,679 --> 00:29:57,462
[SPEAKER_01]: People will buy it because their stuff sells good.

408
00:29:57,963 --> 00:30:00,426
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, you can't really compete with that.

409
00:30:00,945 --> 00:30:13,514
[SPEAKER_02]: And whereas you think they would want people, the everyday other person to see it, like the folks at Kmart that work there or whatever, to see it and create the buzz, they kind of don't have to do that, sadly enough, because the media creates the buzz for them.

410
00:30:13,954 --> 00:30:21,799
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, on a more grassroots level, as far as what we've seen, the buzz for us is all about things that were very easily accessible with very little lines.

411
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:27,103
[SPEAKER_02]: We Heart Katamari, for example, is one of my favorite things I've seen at the show so far, and a lot of that is because...

412
00:30:27,563 --> 00:30:32,486
[SPEAKER_02]: It was easy to play and I could sit there for a while with it and really look into it and I had a great time with it.

413
00:30:33,266 --> 00:30:36,568
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like stuff like Unreal 2007 or whatever it is.

414
00:30:37,468 --> 00:30:39,369
[SPEAKER_01]: I really don't care about that because you know what?

415
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:44,132
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to wait in line for an hour to see video that's going to be on the internet the next day.

416
00:30:44,707 --> 00:30:45,388
[SPEAKER_02]: Dan played it.

417
00:30:45,428 --> 00:30:46,769
[SPEAKER_02]: Controls are exactly the same.

418
00:30:46,789 --> 00:30:48,870
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Ocarina, like Wind Waker, they're both the same.

419
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:21,753
[SPEAKER_03]: But the thing about it though is that he did say that it was pretty cool, but he got to meet Miyamoto.

420
00:31:23,654 --> 00:31:29,197
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so he said that he would have been pissed had he gone and not got to meet Miyamoto.

421
00:31:29,597 --> 00:31:30,917
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was like, whoo, Miyamoto.

422
00:31:31,458 --> 00:31:34,219
[SPEAKER_03]: I get to touch Dan and he got to meet Miyamoto.

423
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:40,594
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing we saw today that was pretty cool was the Atari Flashback 2.0.

424
00:31:40,935 --> 00:31:43,978
[SPEAKER_01]: It's awesome in its wood graininess.

425
00:31:45,019 --> 00:31:46,120
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't wait to try that.

426
00:31:46,601 --> 00:31:48,783
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not big like the old Atari.

427
00:31:48,923 --> 00:31:49,684
[SPEAKER_02]: It's rather little.

428
00:31:49,764 --> 00:31:55,471
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like about the size of an 8x10 piece of paper, maybe even smaller, but it's wood grain and it's cute.

429
00:31:55,531 --> 00:31:56,712
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so cute and precious.

430
00:31:57,358 --> 00:32:00,179
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone also showed me a brand new Nintendo system that someone made.

431
00:32:00,239 --> 00:32:03,660
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a third-party company created a new system that plays Nintendo games.

432
00:32:04,861 --> 00:32:11,603
[SPEAKER_01]: And their brand new system, I guess, is because I didn't know there was this huge demand for Nintendo systems, but I don't know.

433
00:32:12,364 --> 00:32:15,605
[SPEAKER_01]: So they made them, and they're top-loading, just like the revised version.

434
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:25,282
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know what has made a striking absence, given all the hype around it, is Namco versus Capcom.

435
00:32:25,743 --> 00:32:27,145
[SPEAKER_03]: Ex-Capcom, however they're doing.

436
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:29,068
[SPEAKER_03]: Wouldn't that be cross-Capcom then?

437
00:32:29,488 --> 00:32:29,709
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

438
00:32:30,467 --> 00:32:32,788
[SPEAKER_03]: But at any rate, or Namco by Capcom.

439
00:32:33,728 --> 00:32:36,049
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, we went to Capcom to go ask them about it.

440
00:32:36,069 --> 00:32:37,890
[SPEAKER_03]: Capcom was like, go talk to Namco.

441
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:39,610
[SPEAKER_03]: So we trot over to Namco.

442
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:43,592
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, no, at first I asked this one guy, I was like, you should ask the info desk here.

443
00:32:43,632 --> 00:32:46,053
[SPEAKER_03]: Have an ad for Final Fight.

444
00:32:46,093 --> 00:32:47,353
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, ooh, another Final Fight sticker.

445
00:32:47,473 --> 00:32:48,153
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we went over.

446
00:32:48,954 --> 00:32:50,274
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I like Final Fight.

447
00:32:51,114 --> 00:32:57,317
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we trotted over there and started talking to this guy at the Namco booth.

448
00:32:57,417 --> 00:32:58,457
[SPEAKER_03]: His name was Matt.

449
00:32:59,286 --> 00:33:00,126
[SPEAKER_03]: He was really cool.

450
00:33:00,586 --> 00:33:03,847
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's like, yeah, well, we don't have any information on it.

451
00:33:03,907 --> 00:33:06,568
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, yeah, Capcom just said, go talk to Namco.

452
00:33:06,688 --> 00:33:07,468
[SPEAKER_03]: So we did.

453
00:33:07,548 --> 00:33:08,969
[SPEAKER_03]: And he was really cool, though.

454
00:33:08,989 --> 00:33:11,990
[SPEAKER_03]: But he's been following it online like the rest of us have.

455
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:13,690
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're all excited.

456
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:15,371
[SPEAKER_03]: But they don't have anything official right now.

457
00:33:16,091 --> 00:33:16,431
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

458
00:33:16,451 --> 00:33:18,472
[SPEAKER_02]: You're totally starting like a seventh grade war.

459
00:33:18,812 --> 00:33:22,273
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you're going to one person saying, this person's saying you got it.

460
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:26,754
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you went to the other one and said, hey, Capcom, Namco's saying to you, I know, I'm teasing you.

461
00:33:27,227 --> 00:33:30,549
[SPEAKER_03]: That is not what I said at all, because I don't do petty shit like that.

462
00:33:30,949 --> 00:33:31,690
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not cool.

463
00:33:34,011 --> 00:33:37,473
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, whenever I was like, we don't know, go talk to them.

464
00:33:38,033 --> 00:33:45,618
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to say, though, in comparison, Namco's people have been a lot friendlier than Capcom's people.

465
00:33:46,818 --> 00:33:49,820
[SPEAKER_03]: I've gone to some booths and just gotten complete and total apathy.

466
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,762
[SPEAKER_03]: You're there to sell a damn product.

467
00:33:53,042 --> 00:33:54,663
[SPEAKER_03]: Freaking act like it, okay?

468
00:33:55,023 --> 00:33:56,504
[SPEAKER_03]: You are there to market yourselves.

469
00:33:56,524 --> 00:33:58,685
[SPEAKER_03]: You're there to make people want to do business with you.

470
00:33:58,725 --> 00:34:00,326
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a fucking trade show.

471
00:34:01,466 --> 00:34:06,108
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Namco, and you know I have lots of love for Namco.

472
00:34:07,028 --> 00:34:13,051
[SPEAKER_03]: They have gone out of their way to make the people visiting their area feel welcome.

473
00:34:14,071 --> 00:34:22,295
[SPEAKER_03]: They've had people running around with little Pac-Man hats on, handing out squishy things, which they actually ran out of when I went to go play the Namco mobile games.

474
00:34:23,115 --> 00:34:24,857
[SPEAKER_03]: But they'll talk to you.

475
00:34:25,837 --> 00:34:27,619
[SPEAKER_03]: And they know what they're talking about.

476
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:31,902
[SPEAKER_03]: The people are there because they truly enjoy doing what they're doing.

477
00:34:32,283 --> 00:34:36,806
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not there to be a piece of ass in a scrap of leather like the Booth Babes.

478
00:34:38,568 --> 00:34:39,328
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, it's true.

479
00:34:39,429 --> 00:34:45,173
[SPEAKER_03]: They're TNA in a quarter centimeter of leather.

480
00:34:46,755 --> 00:34:47,035
[SPEAKER_03]: You know...

481
00:34:47,904 --> 00:34:50,205
[SPEAKER_03]: But they've really gone out of their way.

482
00:34:50,265 --> 00:34:50,885
[SPEAKER_03]: And Nintendo.

483
00:34:51,485 --> 00:34:53,046
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendo's people have been great.

484
00:34:55,267 --> 00:34:59,808
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to talk to one of their representatives there.

485
00:35:00,208 --> 00:35:02,389
[SPEAKER_03]: And he was just as friendly as he could be.

486
00:35:02,989 --> 00:35:04,670
[SPEAKER_03]: And saying, yeah, you should check this out.

487
00:35:04,690 --> 00:35:05,610
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're doing this.

488
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:10,372
[SPEAKER_03]: And the guys handing out stuff when I played Nintendo, that guy was funny.

489
00:35:10,732 --> 00:35:13,533
[SPEAKER_03]: And he gave me a bunch of styluses.

490
00:35:17,113 --> 00:35:45,264
[SPEAKER_03]: you know me and my grammar but it was those I have to say were just the nicest people and the Korean guys at Xtango they were like play with us it's fun just in comparison it's amazing the differences between the attitude of people and when you go to the places that make you feel like your business is welcome then that's where I'll get my business

491
00:35:45,922 --> 00:35:49,404
[SPEAKER_02]: I've thrown a good word for Konami, too, because they've always been really good to us, of course.

492
00:35:49,484 --> 00:35:54,046
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's kind of different with them because we actually kind of know a lot of the people at this point that work at the booth.

493
00:35:54,106 --> 00:36:00,029
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, just because, obviously, we started as a music and rhythm game station, so, you know, we've kind of grown ties there.

494
00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:04,891
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I actually didn't mention Konami just for that reason.

495
00:36:04,911 --> 00:36:13,856
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the fact that, you know, that's almost like saying that your cousin's a good worker when you hired, you know,

496
00:36:15,393 --> 00:36:17,037
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't know everyone there.

497
00:36:17,077 --> 00:36:20,466
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I sound like a real pompous ass saying that, but I don't know everyone there.

498
00:36:20,506 --> 00:36:24,215
[SPEAKER_02]: And even the folks I don't know are pretty nice and ask if I have questions and stuff.

499
00:36:25,362 --> 00:36:31,465
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's kind of hard when the people up on the stage of Bad Beat Mania are friends of yours.

500
00:36:32,525 --> 00:36:43,350
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course you expect to be friendly from your friends, but I'm just saying for the other people, the ones we don't know as well, just seeing that difference in attitude, Capcom was just apathy.

501
00:36:44,011 --> 00:36:47,332
[SPEAKER_03]: Playing out, we don't want to be here, we're bored, end the con.

502
00:36:48,193 --> 00:36:51,154
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can't handle that.

503
00:36:51,681 --> 00:36:58,382
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually had kind of a weird experience at Capcom last year, and it's kind of made me not just... I kind of walked by their booth, and I was like, man, is there anything I want to see?

504
00:36:58,902 --> 00:36:59,242
[SPEAKER_02]: Not really.

505
00:36:59,322 --> 00:37:00,483
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, beautiful Joe Coffey.

506
00:37:01,423 --> 00:37:02,103
[SPEAKER_02]: Not worth waiting for.

507
00:37:03,423 --> 00:37:04,743
[SPEAKER_03]: No, the guy there, though, he was cool.

508
00:37:05,383 --> 00:37:06,504
[SPEAKER_03]: I chatted with him a little bit.

509
00:37:06,544 --> 00:37:09,104
[SPEAKER_03]: He stood back so I could take a picture of the machine.

510
00:37:09,124 --> 00:37:10,364
[SPEAKER_03]: That was really awesome.

511
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:11,805
[SPEAKER_03]: Told me when to come back.

512
00:37:12,825 --> 00:37:13,365
[SPEAKER_03]: He was cool.

513
00:37:13,905 --> 00:37:18,986
[SPEAKER_03]: And the guy by Final Fight, he said what he knew, but the press people, the people at the desk...

514
00:37:20,024 --> 00:37:20,985
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where I had my bad experience.

515
00:37:21,005 --> 00:37:24,127
[SPEAKER_02]: I had this woman laugh in my face last year, one of the people behind the desk.

516
00:37:24,287 --> 00:37:25,127
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally inappropriate.

517
00:37:26,068 --> 00:37:28,830
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but I got a press kit out of him that last year and this year.

518
00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:30,691
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, she can suck it.

519
00:37:34,553 --> 00:37:35,414
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's just...

520
00:37:36,874 --> 00:37:37,555
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

521
00:37:54,062 --> 00:37:58,384
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, so I mean, and this is not something you're going to read about on those big sites.

522
00:37:58,404 --> 00:38:02,467
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not going to tell you the attitudes, the way it really is when you go to E3.

523
00:38:02,527 --> 00:38:04,127
[SPEAKER_02]: People's attitudes at different booths.

524
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:07,549
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the kind of stuff you're only going to hear here on Orange Lounge Radio.

525
00:38:07,649 --> 00:38:10,451
[SPEAKER_02]: So on that note, I think we're going to wrap it up.

526
00:38:10,651 --> 00:38:13,613
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we've all gotten in what we're going to look at tomorrow, right?

527
00:38:14,973 --> 00:38:17,435
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we going to wrap it up in a scrap of leather like a booth babe?

528
00:38:18,399 --> 00:38:18,939
[SPEAKER_02]: We just might.

529
00:38:18,959 --> 00:38:22,681
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I tried to find age text booths so I could find the anti-booth babes today.

530
00:38:23,041 --> 00:38:27,663
[SPEAKER_02]: I could only find their little room, and the woman working in the room was an attractive gal.

531
00:38:27,743 --> 00:38:32,945
[SPEAKER_02]: She wasn't a booth babe gal, you know, your stereotypical blonde hair, blue eye, big titty booth babe.

532
00:38:33,285 --> 00:38:35,766
[SPEAKER_02]: But she was an attractive female, you know.

533
00:38:36,246 --> 00:38:41,949
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have to figure out where this anti-booth babe, granny panty campaign is going on.

534
00:38:42,765 --> 00:38:45,387
[SPEAKER_01]: And would you really want to be one of those women?

535
00:38:45,647 --> 00:38:48,489
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, you're the ugly person that gets to promote our game.

536
00:38:48,929 --> 00:38:49,590
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.

537
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:55,013
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, we kind of talked about that last Sunday, but... I did.

538
00:38:55,033 --> 00:38:57,095
[SPEAKER_03]: I was sad I didn't get a chance to get his picture.

539
00:38:57,495 --> 00:39:01,257
[SPEAKER_03]: They had people doing KOF, like, cosplay, you know, there as part of their thing.

540
00:39:01,718 --> 00:39:05,400
[SPEAKER_03]: And I walked right past someone who was K, and he was hot.

541
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:10,844
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like... And he went outside to have a smoke.

542
00:39:12,139 --> 00:39:15,382
[SPEAKER_02]: So there you have it, your first booth stud report.

543
00:39:15,422 --> 00:39:15,942
[SPEAKER_02]: So there you go.

544
00:39:16,383 --> 00:39:17,864
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, final thoughts, everybody.

545
00:39:17,904 --> 00:39:18,164
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki.

546
00:39:21,547 --> 00:39:22,328
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's see.

547
00:39:22,948 --> 00:39:30,575
[SPEAKER_01]: My final thought is I got to see a talking donkey, and I took my picture with Mario, even though I didn't want to.

548
00:39:32,076 --> 00:39:38,322
[SPEAKER_01]: And tomorrow, I'm just looking forward to kind of going home because I'm tired.

549
00:39:40,666 --> 00:39:45,889
[SPEAKER_02]: And my final thought is thank you 1up.com for the mango smoothie that I didn't have to pay $5 for.

550
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:57,855
[SPEAKER_03]: Mine is I really, really, really, really, really, really love the Katamari and reject false icons.

551
00:39:59,352 --> 00:40:02,274
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, if you guys have any questions, you still have a chance to email us.

552
00:40:02,334 --> 00:40:03,855
[SPEAKER_02]: Deadline, Friday, 4 p.m.

553
00:40:03,875 --> 00:40:05,877
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't get to them today, but we'll definitely get to some tomorrow.

554
00:40:05,917 --> 00:40:06,818
[SPEAKER_02]: Friday, 4 p.m.

555
00:40:07,919 --> 00:40:09,740
[SPEAKER_02]: E3 at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

556
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,621
[SPEAKER_02]: That's 4 o'clock p.m.

557
00:40:10,661 --> 00:40:11,281
[SPEAKER_02]: West Coast time.

558
00:40:11,741 --> 00:40:14,744
[SPEAKER_02]: We will check the mailbag one more time before we do tomorrow's podcast.
