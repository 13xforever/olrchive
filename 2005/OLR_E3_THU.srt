7
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:43,560
and also the one and only Loki I am here alright so we're having a little bit of

8
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:47,920
technical difficulties I'll tell you what so obviously Wednesday's podcast

9
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,520
actually didn't end up going up until Thursday morning so we apologize for

10
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,120
that delay but we just had all these ideas on how we were gonna upload the

11
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:00,220
show and none of them worked first off go figure neither of the hotels were

12
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:03,060
staying at happen because we're actually across two separate hotels the three of

13
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:08,300
us neither of them have Wi-Fi access so that does us no good there and then the

14
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:13,180
internet cafe that is up the street from where Loki and I are staying was closed

15
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:16,260
yesterday and we were thinking oh we'll just upload it over there no they're

16
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:19,980
closed so we had to wait and today we uploaded it from the e3 Business Center

17
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:22,840
so we finally got it up there so you guys actually won't hear this until

18
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:27,480
Friday morning so we apologize for that delay but you know it happens and we're

19
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:32,680
still bringing you the coverage faster than the 99.9% of the other sites out

20
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,080
there on the internet so we're really excited about that we also want to give

21
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:39,240
a big thank you to Jason our webmaster who has is helping us out on the other

22
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:44,400
end and getting these podcasts to you guys yeah all right so let's talk about

23
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,640
Thursday how you guys feeling after today two-thirds of the showdown only

24
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:54,540
Friday to go today is the longest day of e3 as well going from nine o'clock in the morning to six o'clock in the evening

25
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:57,780
I know Loki and I were there all day. Jamie G there nine o'clock to

26
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:01,640
Got there around ten something actually because we went to breakfast

27
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,480
Not us we we kind of skip breakfast

28
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:09,480
Well, we actually ended up eating like pizza what at about 1130 or so?

29
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,940
No, no even before that was Mike 1030 or something

30
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:16,240
It was about 1030 and the reason behind that is is if you don't eat at e3

31
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:20,720
3 super early in the day or super late in the day you will be waiting in line

32
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:27,640
for a long time as lanky style from the other show and I found out on yes on

33
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:32,680
Wednesday we waited in line for like 45 minutes to get an $8 hamburger and fries

34
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:37,620
which is like even worse quality than you'd get at Burger King so that's one

35
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:41,760
thing if you guys planning on going to e3 in the future eat early eat late or

36
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,680
sneak your food in I don't know you know what I actually ate a hamburger too just

37
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:51,280
without the bun and she gave me two patties I had a cheeseburger and it was

38
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,880
still eight bucks all right yeah I got twice as much food as you did also I

39
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,960
want to just say to you guys real quick we are having another technical

40
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,760
difficulty tonight we actually only have one microphone so if you ever couple

41
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,480
clanks and weird volume things it's just because we're passing it back and forth

42
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,760
but again we want to bring you guys the up to new up to the minute news so we're

43
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:15,300
just kind of making do with it anyway Loki also remember it if you're coming

44
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:19,460
to e3 to buy food bring cash because I don't know why but like after about a

45
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:23,460
couple hours after they open there's like you know we don't want to you know

46
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:29,940
have to worry about you know doing our you know credit cards and whatnot so

47
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:33,980
you know to hell with it and you're screwed because you have your food and

48
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:39,500
you're like oh can I pay the credit no ah crap then then you're stuck in the

49
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:45,700
awkward moment luckily I always bring cash so just one of the fun thing and

50
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:49,420
you know so I okay one other thing I gotta say about all that is you notice

51
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:54,060
that around the LA Convention Center there is no fast food whatsoever no

52
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:57,980
McDonald's no burger within a reasonable walking distance nothing you think they

53
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:00,740
do that on purpose so that you're kind of forced to eat those I heard they

54
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:04,640
chased away a hot dog vendor today too that wasn't licensed they fear

55
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:12,400
competition is so that you buy their overpriced crappy but food alright

56
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,480
enough talk about food I'm sorry guys let's move on to the games the games

57
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:19,360
what we really want to talk about let's do the what we did yesterday let's talk

58
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:23,520
about three interesting games that we saw today at e3 three things we played

59
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,840
and enjoy let's go around and start with Loki three games actually no wait you

60
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,920
stole mine yesterday I'm starting off today three three games I played today

61
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:36,240
that I enjoyed. First off, Castlevania DS I actually checked out today and I thought

62
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,800
it was pretty cool. I like the way that you can kind of draw to defeat the boss.

63
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,840
It was kind of interesting. A lot of DS games to date, they've relied solely on

64
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:50,520
the touch, I think, the touch element of the game. Whereas Castlevania DS, it was a

65
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:54,280
Castlevania game like you'd see on the Game Boy Advance with your map or

66
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:59,240
sub-screen shown at the top, but the drawing only came into it once in a

67
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:05,680
while, which I thought was very cool. So, Castlevania DS I liked for that. What else

68
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:12,560
did I play today that I liked? I also played, over at Nintendo, I managed to play

69
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,560
Donkey Konga 2, which was interesting, it was different, but some of the songs in it

70
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,120
were really weird. Like, the song I played was Headstrong, and I don't even remember who sings that,

71
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:27,440
because I don't listen to mainstream music, but, um, Headstrong, eh, whatever. So it was weird to hear that in

72
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:33,800
Donkey Konga though of all things and then I'm trying to think what else oh

73
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:37,600
yes one pleasant surprise the first thing I saw this morning over at

74
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,640
Midway's booth I played Mortal Kombat Shaolin Monks which I wasn't sure what

75
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,960
to expect from that I thought it was just gonna be another Mortal Kombat game

76
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:48,440
but it's more like Mortal Kombat in the I don't know if this is a fair comparison

77
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:52,240
but in the Devil May Cry sense where you're walking around and you're just

78
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,800
like beating things up but it's kind of cool because if you pick up a weapon

79
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,160
like in more total Mortal Kombat style you're lobbing off heads and arms and

80
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:04,000
all that fun stuff and you get to do fatalities. I was actually really

81
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,720
pleasantly surprised with Mortal Kombat Salamence it's actually one of those

82
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,440
few games I see that I'm like you know I'm gonna have to buy this when it comes

83
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:14,520
out but of course I've always been kind of a Mortal Kombat fan I guess so

84
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:19,880
I say so those are my three. Logie? It was Mortal Kombat of War that's what it was

85
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:24,080
because everyone's got to do the God of War Devil May Cry game even Disney but

86
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,080
I haven't played that one yet.

87
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,680
Is that That's So Raven 2, where Raven Simones just starts coming out and kicking the crap

88
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,680
out of everybody?

89
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,680
You wish.

90
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:39,120
No, that would be the Nightmare Before Christmas game that's, you know, based on- Raven Simones

91
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,400
and Nightmare Before Christmas?

92
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,600
No, Raven Simones should not be in any game.

93
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,600
Ever.

94
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,600
I don't know.

95
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,400
They really set crap for the Game Boy Advance.

96
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,400
Another reason why I'm not buying the Game Boy Micro.

97
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:53,000
Okay, I don't need crap in smaller sizes.

98
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Still crap.

99
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,360
I played a couple games today. I played LA rush which is

100
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:05,280
Just like San Francisco rush except you have no clue where the hell you're supposed to be going. It was very unclear

101
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,280
It's just like driving in LA for reals

102
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,200
It was unclear where the hell you're supposed to be going

103
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:13,780
You actually had to look at your map and look at you know

104
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:20,960
These checkpoints that they had that resembled something from either say Grand Theft Auto during your your checkpoint race missions or whatever or?

105
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,960
or Midnight Club, the original Midnight Club,

106
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,240
where you have this beam of light coming,

107
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,240
and so you see it off in the distance,

108
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,240
but you're like, how the hell do I get there?

109
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,060
And a lot of times I got lost.

110
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:34,300
It was just not fun in that sense.

111
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,720
And the other annoying thing is every time

112
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,080
you get in a high-speed car crash,

113
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,560
they do slow-mo instant replay.

114
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,160
Annoying as hell.

115
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,400
Yeah, sure, ooh, it looks cool, but guess what?

116
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,000
You're not burnout, so stop trying to be like burnout.

117
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,900
Okay, you're L.A. Rush.

118
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:54,540
San Francisco rush you know unrealistic you know loops and stuff that is what I expect from LA rush. That's not what I got

119
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:59,620
It's just trying to be burnout, and I don't like that. It's really bad anyways

120
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:05,700
The other thing I played was shadow the Hedgehog and that was okay

121
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:10,820
That's all it was it was just Sonic with a gun, and that's it's really. I was just like okay

122
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:14,520
Whatever not really impressed at all

123
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,480
So, big deal for that.

124
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:21,840
And then, kind of touched back to something I talked about yesterday, I played Dance Dance

125
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:29,500
Revolution Xtreme 2, but with the IToy support today, and I was, once again, not very impressed

126
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,760
by the hands and feet mode.

127
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,200
I thought it was retarded.

128
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:37,280
No, no, no, no, you're just pissed off because you failed your song, and you're also pissed

129
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:40,480
off that when I played In the Heat of the Night, expert into hands and feet mode, that

130
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,480
I got a crowd.

131
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,880
So, you know, don't go there.

132
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:48,780
First off, hands and feet mode, all they do is throw up some random hand, um, wave things

133
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:50,700
or whatever, and that's it.

134
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:51,980
It kinda sucked.

135
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:58,940
But really, um, any other game, well there's another game I played today that, um, we'll

136
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:04,100
go into later just because, you know, well, it's just a different story.

137
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,140
But yeah, that's pretty much it.

138
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:08,140
Those are the three games I played.

139
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:12,380
Dark Sakura, your big three from today, Thursday.

140
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:19,380

Um, I have to completely just gush over Kingdom Hearts 2. Oh, it was Kingdom Hearts 2. It

00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:58,480
you give me a dollar anyway anyway Kingdom Hearts 2 is pretty and it's very

158
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:03,160
I mean, it's really it the graph this has retains the same graphic style

159
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:08,080
I mean, it's pretty much on with the last one except you can tell it does more in subtle ways

160
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:14,400
First of all, I have to mention this. This is what made me really bouncy went over to a squenix

161
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:19,800
No pictures. No pictures. No, we're gonna hide the game from the world

162
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,360
And I haven't seen a single other booth say you can't take pictures

163
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:34,480
um PlayStation did the same thing well f them both yeah anyway I tried over to

164
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,760
Buena Vista today eyes look around no one's there so I start playing and

165
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:44,120
picture guys like I'll play for you while you take pictures and I'll show

166
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:49,080
you the cool shit you can take pictures of them and I wanted to actually get his

167
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:52,400
name and he's like no I don't actually work for Buena Vista I'm more of a

168
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:56,040
correspondence so I said I'll credit you as that nice guy at the Buena Vista

169
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:04,560
booth so thank you nice guy anyway he showed me you can actually fuse with

170
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,520
other characters in your party and actually it's really cool when you fuse

171
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:17,760
with goofy because you get the valor okay bitch you get you get the valor and

172
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:24,080
he wears this red outfit and he wields two key blades and that was

173
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:29,240
pretty cool and he's got all this power and he did the the Mulan level he did

174
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:32,320
the level where Hades is trying to kick your ass but the Mulan level is cool

175
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:37,360
because you know the scene where who is the bad guy in Mulan I don't remember

176
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,000
his name but you know he comes over the hill and there's a few of his army there

177
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,640
and they're like okay and they rush and then a bajillion of them rush over the

178
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:50,120
hill well instead it was a bunch of heart of the heartless and we're talking

179
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:57,760
like there were easily several hundred on the screen at that time attacking you

180
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,580
and you just have to outlast the clock at this point but there and I've got

181
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:07,360
several pictures of it they're gonna be online when we get back unless somebody

182
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,800
is kind enough to take them back beforehand but there was just so many on

183
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:17,520
screen I was really impressed I mean hi we are all over the place we are yellow

184
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:21,840
and ugly in which I kick your ass that's everything so that was really cool and

185
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:26,360
then I got to get into one of the media events I got because I went over there

186
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:31,200
because I talked about call Cthulhu the other night when we did our last actual

187
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:36,120
podcast so I had I found out where Bethesda was and I was like you know I

188
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,720
like I've been looking at this call Cthulhu thing and it looks pretty

189
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,440
groovy it's like well okay come on in and so I sat there with the other press

190
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:50,660
people and the guy was playing through it and I was like oh cool but the best

191
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:56,000
thing about it you know visually it's you know it's about 80% done and

192
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,640
actually I got some more stats on it but it has it's gonna be I do believe he

193
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:05,660
said out in either August or September you have an insanity meter the basically

194
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:09,800
the main character was a policeman who went insane and then he got out of the

195
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:15,880
asylum and became a detective well you when you see shocking images like in one

196
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:22,800
scene there was a like a ghoul pinned to a cross in this church or when you're

197
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:27,920
being chased or other things your insanity level goes up and your screen

198
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:32,800
starts getting wavy start getting tunnel vision and then you hallucinate like

199
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:37,720
There's one scene where he's running down a tunnel all of a sudden. He's running through the halls of the asylum

200
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:42,720
He was trapped in or when you enter a new scene if your insanity level is high enough

201
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:47,780
Then you get flashes of where all the enemies in the area are

202
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:52,320
You and he says there's two ways of doing each level you can do it the right way the sneaky way with it

203
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,500
you know takes a little bit longer or

204
00:14:55,080 --> 00:15:01,220
You can just rush through everything guns blazing actually said that the sneaky way actually tends to be a little bit shorter

205
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:05,260
but I'll have more information now I'm gonna do a write-up on it you can all

206
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:10,700
see it on orange lounge radio.com plug plug and hear me gush about it on a

207
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:15,380
pump up the volume later on so Kingdom hearts to call go through Louie got one

208
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:36,800
the next topic is I know we want to talk

209
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:41,260
next about oh wait you thought another one I still have to go back and say that

210
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:46,960
uh that shadow the hedgehog was pretty groovy looking oh no I know what it was

211
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:52,220
my other game gun star superheroes because it's just gun star heroes and

212
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:57,040
that's all all right well Jamie spoiled a little bit of our next segment the

213
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:05,120
most inch spoiler oh my omg spoiler spoiler my ass okay so what I want to

214
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:11,760
Talk about now is the most interesting moment of your e3 day, so I'll start with Loki since this got spoiled OMG. I

215
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:19,160
Was gonna talk about that. Oh well anyways um yeah, so I went to this one booth that they had there

216
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:23,360
It was right next to X tango. Which is the game we talked about last year. It was pretty cool

217
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,960
So it's tango music game sort of like bust to move

218
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,520
anyways and

219
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,460
Now there's this like cyber sex game called

220
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:41,120
uh oh man feel free and anyways so basically the game I don't really know

221
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:47,640
what the premise was cuz I only got to see it for like a very brief time and so

222
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:52,940
um basically you had is sort of remind me the sims but you had different things

223
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:56,120
that you're kind of like controlling the girl you were talking to or something

224
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:00,080
and so you kid like you know the guy would start dancing and you click D or

225
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:03,100
whatever to make her dance and then you could do different like

226
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:10,360
Provocative dance stuff and then and then he's like, oh, he's all like because it's like this Asian guy that spoke no English

227
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:16,300
He's all he's all there real brief English and he's like he's a pick here. See it takes her top off

228
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:20,320
Okay, so I clicked I clicked here took her top off on my oh, that's kind of cool

229
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,400
So he's just let me play around with it

230
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:27,800
So I click their shorts or her miniskirt and then I came up and then all hell broke loose

231
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:33,380
was like, no no no no no no no no no. That's illegal. No, no no. And so they had, like,

232
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:37,040
someone come over to translate, and she's like, no, you can't do that cuz it's illegal

233
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:42,720
or something like that. I'm like, okay. One other thing I thought was interesting about

234
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,480
that game, and I, I don't remember the name of it, does anybody recall, it's on my camera

235
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,820
somewhere, we'll post more information on the site. Feel 3 I think was the name of it.

236
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:53,040
Was it Cyber Entertainment was the name of the booth I think? It's, anyway, it's important.

237
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:56,040
it's it was important but this is everything so not only is it like a

238
00:17:56,040 --> 00:18:02,240
cyber sex him it has webcam windows in the upper left and upper right so you

239
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:08,720
can go virtual and you can go like really virtual like really interactive

240
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,760
it's it's kind of scary because there's people that are really gonna benefit

241
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:16,100
from this game and that's makes me sad a bit I'm thinking one person controls a

242
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:19,520
guy the other one controls the girl that's what it seems like you do

243
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,940
understand when this game comes out they're both gonna be controlled by God

244
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:27,920
whether you know it or not you can tell there's the camera that's why they have

245
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:33,860
it it's the dude camera nothing a wig and a little makeup can't hide nothing

246
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:38,680
they're holding a photo up in front of your webcam yeah I'll just loop this

247
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:44,880
Jenna Jameson footage I taped off the TV a little while ago all I know is it's

248
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:49,720
just weird and they had this weird like audio box thing there I don't know if

249
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:54,480
that was part of it or what but God knows what it was because it's supposed

250
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,880
to be totally interactive and I don't know what they how far they're talking

251
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:02,000
totally interactive who knows anyways yeah that was that was the weird thing

252
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,080
that happened today one of the weird things the cyber sex game had a weird

253
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:12,600
box moving on dark soccer the most interesting thing you saw today or

254
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:22,080
interesting experience I got to play with the Katamari today and I got to put

255
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:26,240
our media sampler on the Katamari and then you've got to put the reject false

256
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,920
icon sticker on there for me made me feel like a happy fan it was the

257
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:34,760
Katamari and then I got to climb all over stuff and actually get into media

258
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:40,760
stuff without actually being media passes that was pretty cool and you know

259
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:45,580
Um when I put your sticker on the Katamari I they actually gave me a Katamari to mashi to mousepad

260
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:49,240
Well, they gave me another one because I went back to play the game with Mila Tava

261
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,160
I went back to play it again later. They gave me a second one

262
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:56,160
So I'm thinking about maybe doing a little giveaway in the near future for one of our lucky fans. We'll see

263
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:03,400
Actually, no that I remember there's actually something else that I was gonna say was my most interesting moment. That was my massage

264
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:09,800
because my I went out well I got the free one the Tylenol ouch booth thing

265
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:13,260
and that was all cool and the guy worked on my hip you know cuz I was in that car

266
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:17,360
accident and I was really in pain but I went back after this is about an hour

267
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:23,080
after my bike getting kicked in haha but I went back and paid for a like a 25

268
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:32,560
minute full massage and my masseur was a was an actual stand-up comedian so when

269
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:36,040
When he was giving me my foot rub, he was making me laugh.

270
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:40,160
Welcome to L.A., everybody.

271
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:48,560
But I like what he said, that making somebody laugh is a serious business, you know.

272
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:54,680
And we got to talking about how... yeah.

273
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:59,640
But we got to a discussion on how, you know, if you live your life all stressed out, and

274
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:04,080
don't laugh you don't do anything for yourself you're gonna die okay you're

275
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:10,780
just going to get cancer of the lower intestine and die not able to shit on

276
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:17,360
your own what a pleasant image to paint for all these people who are tuning in

277
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:25,480
to hear the latest game news thank you it was an example of but you know we

278
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:30,480
were talking about you know those of us who take time to enjoy our lives you

279
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:35,880
know take time to laugh take time to play games you know stress relief you

280
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:39,760
know have some leisurely time those are the people who are generally gonna have

281
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,080
a happier outlook and who are gonna live longer lives at least unless the car hits

282
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:47,880
them oh boy all right so lesson learned today you know that kind of goes along

283
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:51,560
with your advice column you know that we do usually on our typical podcast we do

284
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:55,200
weekly you know because if we you know sat in the house and played video games

285
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,440
games all day, we'd have no time to go out and go to Hooters while we're in LA.

286
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:03,520
So remember, point and laugh. It'll add five years to your life.

287
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:08,720
Alright, my most interesting moment today. I actually went and stood in line to get

288
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:13,640
autographs from the folks that do Attack of the Show over on G4. Now typically I'm

289
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:17,480
not one of those, you know, starstruck people because, you know, everybody's just

290
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:21,280
people. It's just another job. Just like, you know, I have a day job. That's their

291
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:25,000
day job. They're just, they just got a day job that in some ways is a little more

292
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,480
fun but can also be a lot of work I've been on that side of it studying

293
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,320
colleges I know it's a lot of work but my dad really really likes it because

294
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,800
he's been following the screen savers ever since it was Leo Lepore and then it

295
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:39,220
transitioned and transitioned he's moved along with it now it's this attack of

296
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:43,680
the show so I was like okay my dad's really excited for me to be here a

297
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:47,180
moment so I'm gonna go get him an autograph so I went and I got him an

298
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:50,480
autograph and I told Sarah Lane while I had a mo because they were nice and they

299
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,160
you know chatted up with us a little bit while we were each kind of waiting for

300
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:57,600
autograph and Sarah Lane asked me and say you know how are you and I so fine

301

305
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:19,360
make an awkward moment you know I might been an awkward moment hi guys if you're

306
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:25,720
listening cuz cuz Matt ended up slipping something hello your name tag doesn't

307
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:33,480
say Alan I mean hi Alan yeah Alan's my stage name I think she was just trying

308
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:38,480
to be cute so I totally respect her for that but yeah it was kind of it was kind

309
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,600
of one of those things was like you know I could tell the truth here but I don't

310
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:46,120
want to make an awkward moment I'll just take it as a you know oh she's being

311
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:51,060
She's nice. They were very nice to kind of chat it up with all this because I've you know also seen those

312
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:55,600
You know autograph signings where they're like sign next sign next so that was cool of them

313
00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:01,740
And actually I thought g4s booth all things considered because they've taken a lot of heat ever since the tech TV

314
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:07,560
I thought they actually had kind of an interesting booth where you could kind of play the actual Nintendo and everything and then Matt

315
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:11,340
Ended up seizing this opportunity. What did you do Matt while we were in line for that?

316
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:17,000
Well, I was, you were talking to her about, you know, what Warner's Lounge Radio was,

317
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
so I figured I'd just help Claire.

318
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
I did ask!

319
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:26,240
I mean, so, um, while I was having, um, Kevin, uh, Pura, and, uh, Sarah Lane to have, signing,

320
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:31,360
um, the picture that they gave me here, um, I gave them one of our media samplers for

321
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:37,060
a podcast, so, you know, hello, Kevin and Sarah, or, Kevin and Sarah's interns, whoever

322
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:41,200
it may be that, that might possibly listen to the show, hello.

323
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,220
Kevin and Sarah's trash can for all we know I mean who knows yes the bum rum

324
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:48,880
machine outside the trash picking up you know CD thinking it's something valuable

325
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:53,120
now anyways no no they're really cool and the booth is pretty cool you know

326
00:24:53,120 --> 00:25:00,120
I've in the past you know given g4 a little bit of you know criticism but hey

327
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:04,440
really I figured out who the real real villain of this you know everything is

328
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:08,980
it's all Comcast because because for you know it's all their fault that my cable

329
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:13,540
never works let's face it kids we haven't said anything everyone else on

330
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:18,740
the internet hasn't already said sorry that's just you know anyway oh and we

331
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:21,820
have film for some TV thing too but I don't I don't know I don't remember what

332
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:29,100
it was we were filmed as bumpers for what was it g4tv.com so if you find a

333
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:35,020
rerun or happen to see g4tv.com their e3 coverage you will see us as a

334
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:40,560
commercial intro you know or whatever so you'll see no us like yelling screaming

335
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:47,020
because that's what we were told to do and also we got to play with the eight

336
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:51,820
foot Nintendo controller that they built which is cool and I am dedicated now to

337
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:58,140
build one that's larger just because I have to another one of those projects

338
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:04,320
you'll never finish all right all right so tomorrow is the last day of e3 what

339
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:08,320
What are your guys' plans? Something you definitely have to check out tomorrow at E3 with the last day.

340
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:11,320
Sitting in the Sony line for three hours.

341
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:16,320
What is up with the lines at E3? I know we kind of talked about this a little bit yesterday.

342
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:20,320
But I haven't bitched about it enough. Every booth has some type of line.

343
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,320
It's like, Midway had a line if you want to see Unreal.

344
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:26,320
Sega has a line if you want to see whatever. I don't know because I didn't sit in a line.

345
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:30,320
Quake 4 has a line. Nintendo has a three hour line.

346
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:34,380
realize you know a lot of folks are like boy e3 is so glamorous you get to play

347
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:37,440
all the latest and greatest games and don't get me wrong it's pretty cool we're

348
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,940
very lucky to be able to go to e3 and we're having a good time overall but to

349
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:44,140
play the really good stuff you guys it's like going to Disneyland if you want to

350
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:48,460
ride the nice ride you got to sit in line for three hours and you know for

351
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:54,340
that five-minute thrill it's kind of you know too bad well I'm still gonna be

352
00:26:54,340 --> 00:27:02,620
getting up at 7 and trying to be over there by well they start at 9 try to be

353
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:07,780
over there by like a quarter till uh thing you're most looking forward to

354
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:14,540
doing tomorrow Loki going home to be honest I mean honestly I'm done the show

355
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:19,420
right now that I thought the whole line it Nintendo's booth was to see the

356
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:22,740
revolution then when I found out just to play the stupid Zelda game I was like oh

357
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:25,020
Ah, the hell with that! I'm not staying there.

358
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:27,780
I'll go see Sony, because at least they're gonna show the PS3.

359
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:31,740
Nintendo, oh wow, you show us your ugly system, but nothing that does.

360
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:34,780
You hype it up and you don't come through and say, you say,

361
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:38,260
here's our little, little Game Boy Advance, come play it!

362
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:40,700
I'm like, ugh, awful!

363
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:45,820
You know, honestly, let's make it a little bit smaller and charge some more for it.

364
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:47,580
That'd be, that'd be better.

365
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:49,660
I have to kind of retract something I said yesterday.

366
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:53,020
I actually got the DS download thing in Nintendo to work better for me today

367
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:57,140
And I still have medios on my DS because I put it in sleep mode. So that's kind of cool

368
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:59,340
So I feel a little better about the DS download thing now

369
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:02,860
And I'm gonna have to go back then and get a electroplankton

370
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:05,820
electroplankton

371
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:10,740
Honestly, no one make you three a lot better. It didn't make it harder to get into because

372
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:15,420
Everybody's just coming in no matter what. I mean you're some people that are like

373
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:22,020
sort of in the industry, you know, those are the people that are coming in. And granted,

374
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:26,540
we are sort of in the industry but there's some people that really are like,

375
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:32,540
I work for Kmart, Kmart sells video games, therefore I get in. When in fact they

376
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:35,740
work in the lawn and garden department. But I mean, and if you think I'm making

377
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:39,640
this shit up, I'm not. Like there's actually people there who are doing that.

378
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:42,340
They work in the lawn and garden department at Kmart but because Kmart

379
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:45,840
sells video games they get in and it's kind of like okay dude you need to draw

380
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:50,100
the line somewhere maybe rethink you know because again as you said you know

381
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:53,820
we're kind of on the bubble and other podcasters at least we haven't run into

382
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:57,780
anybody there you know they probably think they can't even get in that's the

383
00:28:57,780 --> 00:29:01,380
thing see that's why you have no companies like rock star and so I have

384
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:03,420
all the stuff behind closed doors because they don't want the average

385
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:07,460
person seeing stuff they want people that are covering the press and stuff to

386
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:10,620
see it so it's just like they're creating like another level that you

387
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:17,080
have to get to in order to actually see the entire show, which is dumb. I don't even understand

388
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:25,180
some of these smaller companies. For example, who's the company that does... Not Crave,

389
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:31,140
but just some of the stuff in Kentia Hall. You can't even see the company's stuff because

390
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:36,700
it's just behind these closed doors and stuff. It's like, oh, wow. I'd figure... Yeah, Gravity,

391
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:40,200
for example. I'd figure a small company like that would be like, hey, check out our stuff.

392
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:45,340
and check out our stuff. You know, whereas you got cocky people like Rockstar M that,

393
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:50,000
you know, they're just like, ah, our stuff is too good for you. You'll see it and you'll

394
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,920
buy it when it comes out. The end, you know, and to be honest, that is the truth. People

395
00:29:54,920 --> 00:30:00,400
will buy it because their stuff sells good and you know, you can't really compete with

396
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:03,280
that. And whereas you think they would want people,

397
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:08,000
the everyday other person to see it, like the folks at Kmart that worked there or whatever,

398
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,480
see it and create the buzz they kind of don't have to do that sadly enough

399
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,880
because the media creates the buzz for them.

400
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:17,400
Well you know on a more grassroots level you know as far as what we've seen the

401
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:21,040
buzz for us is all about things that were very easily accessible with very

402
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,040
little lines.

403
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:25,120
We heart Katamari for example is one of my favorite things I've seen at the show

404
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:29,480
so far and a lot of that is because it was easy to play and I could like sit

405
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:32,360
there for a while with it and really look into it and I had a great time with

406
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:32,840
it.

407
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:36,520
It's just like stuff like unreal 2007 or whatever it is

408
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:39,300
I really don't care about that because you know what?

409
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:44,060
I'm not gonna wait in line for an hour to see video that's gonna be on the internet the next day

410
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:49,120
Like granted there are some people that would I mean some people wouldn't wait in line to see Zelda

411
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:54,200
But you know, it's just whatever you're into I guess some but at least you get a free shirt with Zelda

412
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,180
So I'm actually thinking tomorrow for me

413
00:30:56,180 --> 00:31:00,620
I may actually sit in that Zelda line because I also know some of our listeners want to know about it

414
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:03,940
So if I sit in that three-hour line for you guys, you better be thankful

415
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:07,180
Dan played it

416
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:09,720
Controls exactly the same

417
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:13,540
Like ocarina like when waker they're both the same

418
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,260
but

419
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:21,580
The the thing about it though is that he did say that it was pretty cool, but he got to meet me a little

420
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:25,460
Yeah, so he said that he would have been pissed

421
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:28,780
Had he gone and not got to meet me a little

422
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:35,780
So I was like, ooh, Miyamoto, I get to touch Dan, and he got to meet Miyamoto.

423
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:42,140
Another thing we saw today that was pretty cool was the Atari Flashback 2.0.

424
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:44,860
It's awesome in its wood graininess.

425
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:46,640
I can't wait to try that.

426
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,960
It's not big like the old Atari.

427
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:49,960
It's rather little.

428
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:54,680
It's about the size of an 8x10 piece of paper, maybe even smaller, but it's wood grain and

429
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,680
it's cute.

430
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,500
It's so cute and precious.

431
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:01,360
also showed me a brand new Nintendo system that someone made. It's like a third-party

432
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:06,420
company created a new system that plays Nintendo games. And their brand new system, I guess,

433
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:12,380
is because I didn't know there was this huge demand for Nintendo systems, but I don't know.

434
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:15,700
So they made them and they're top-loading, just like the revised version.

435
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:24,700
Well, you know what has made a striking absence, given all the hype around it, is Namco versus

436
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:28,960
Capcom X Capcom with however they're doing would that be cross Capcom then

437
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:35,060
anyway but at any rate or Namco by Capcom ha ha anyway we went to Capcom

438
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:39,500
to go ask him back happens like go talk to me I'm cool so we trot over Namco

439
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:43,460
well no at first I asked this one guys like you should ask the info desk here

440
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:47,780
have a ad for final fight I'm like ooh another final fight sticker and then we

441
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:54,300
went over because I like final fight and then we trotted over there and started

442
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:59,980
talking to this guy at the Namco booth his name was Matt he was really cool

443
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:04,380
he's like yeah well we don't have any information on it and that's like yeah

444
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:08,900
Capcom just said go talk to me I'm cold so we did and he was really cool though

445
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:13,180
but he's been following it online like the rest of us have and we're all

446
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:16,540
excited but they don't have anything official right now you know what you're

447
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:19,620
totally starting like a seventh-grade war because like you're going to one

448
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:22,780
person saying this person's you know saying you got it and then you went to

449
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:27,300
the other ones that hey Capcom Namco seeing you I know I'm teasing you that

450
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:32,780
is not what I said at all cuz I don't do petty shit like that that's not cool I

451
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:38,460
didn't basically I whenever is like no we don't know go talk to them I have to

452
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:45,220
say though in comparison Namco's people have been a lot friendlier than Capcom's

453
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:48,980
people there's just I've gone to some booths and just gotten complete and

454
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:55,160
total apathy you're there to sell a damn product freaking act like it okay you

455
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:58,240
are there to market yourselves you're there to make people want to do business

456
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:04,000
with you is a fucking trade show you know Namco I have you know and you know

457
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:09,480
I have lots of love for Namco they have gone out of their way to make the people

458
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:15,740
visiting their area feel welcome they've had people running around with a little

459
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:19,700
pac-man hats on handing out squishy things which they actually ran out of

460
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:25,040
when I went to go play the Namco mobile games but they'll talk to you they'll

461
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:29,640
build and they know what they're talking about the people are there because they

462
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:34,040
truly enjoy doing what they're doing they're not there to be you know a piece

463
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:39,240
of ass and a you know scrap of leather like the booth babes sorry it's true

464
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:48,000
their tna in a you know like a quarter centimeter of leather you know but

465
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,720
they've really gone out of their way in Nintendo Nintendo's people have been

466
00:34:52,720 --> 00:35:00,400
great you know they I got to talk to one of their representatives there and he

467
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:04,760
was just as friendly as he could be and say yeah you should check this out and

468
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:09,900
they're doing this and the guys handing out stuff when I played a Nintendo was

469
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:17,480
funny and he gave me a bunch of style stylist stylist stylists is you know me

470
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:24,800
in my grammar but it was those I have to say we're just the nicest people I've

471
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:29,640
done the Korean guys at X tango they were like play with us it's fun you know

472
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:35,960
after just in comparison it's amazing the differences between you know the

473
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:41,280
attitude of people and when you go to the places that make you feel like your

474
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:46,320
your business is welcome then that's where I'll get my business I've thrown a

475
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:49,120
good word for Konami too because they've always been really good to us and of

476
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,960
course but but it's kind of different with them because we actually kind of

477
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:54,760
know a lot of the people at this point that work at the booth so you know just

478
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:58,640
because obviously we started as a music and rhythm game station so you know

479
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:04,400
we've kind of grown ties there well I actually didn't mention Konami just for

480
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:11,520
that reason you know the fact that you know that's that's almost like saying

481
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:15,960
that your cousin's a good worker when you hired you know but I don't know

482
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:19,440
everyone there I mean I'd sound like a real pompous ass saying that but I don't

483
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:23,160
know everyone there and even the folks I don't know are pretty nice and ask if I

484
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:29,100
questions and stuff. Yeah, it's kind of hard when, you know, the people up on

485
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:33,600
the stage by BeatMania are friends of yours. You know, of course you expect to be

486
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:37,640
friendly from your friends, but I'm just saying, you know, for the other people, the

487
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:41,160
ones we don't know as well, you know, just seeing that difference in attitude,

488
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:46,900
Capcom was just apathy. Playing out, we don't want to be here, we're bored, end the

489
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:52,560
con, and I can't, you know, I can't handle that. I actually had a kind of a weird

490
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:56,160
experience at Capcom last year and it's kind of made me not just I kind of walk

491
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:59,000
by their booth and I was like man is there anything I want to see no not

492
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:04,000
really Oh a beautiful joke coffee and not worth waiting for no the guy there

493
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,600
that he was cool we chatted with him a little bit he stood back so I could take

494
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:13,040
a picture of the machine that was really awesome told me when to come back he was

495
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:17,480
cool and the guy by Final Fight he was you know said what he knew but like the

496
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:21,040
press people the people at the desk that's where I had my back experience I

497
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:24,240
had this woman laughing my face last year one of the people behind the desk

498
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:28,520
totally inappropriate yeah but I got a press kit out of them that last year in

499
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:38,360
this year she can suck it in it will it's just it's just the level of how

500
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:41,960
people are dealt with you know again this is a trade show you are there to

501
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:45,760
market yourself and you were there ultimately to get business that's not

502
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,880
the way you go about getting business I'm sorry

503
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:52,520
You know, we we cover the video game news and the that's part of the news, I think

504
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:58,200
Yep, so I mean and this is not something you're gonna read about on those big sites

505
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:03,980
They're not gonna tell you the attitudes the way it really is when you go to e3 people's attitudes a different booth

506
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:08,860
That's the kind of stuff. You're only gonna hear here on Orange Launch Radio. So on that note

507
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:13,500
I think we're gonna wrap it up. I think we've all we've all gotten what in what we're gonna look at tomorrow, right?

508
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:18,440
Are we going to wrap it up in a scrap of leather like a booth babe?

509
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,440
We just might.

510
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,880
You know, I tried to find H-Tech's booth so I could find the anti-booth babes today.

511
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:27,320
I could only find their little room and the woman working in the room was an attractive

512
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,320
gal.

513
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:32,400
She wasn't a booth babe gal, you know, your stereotypical blonde hair, blue eye, big titty

514
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,400
booth babe.

515
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:36,300
But she was an attractive female, you know.

516
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:42,800
So I have to figure out where this anti-booth babe granny panty campaign is going on.

517
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:48,400
Would you really want to be one of those women? Oh, yeah, you're the ugly person that gets the promoter game

518
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,440
Thanks

519
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:53,320
yeah, well we kind of talked about that last Sunday, but I

520
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,040
Did I was sad I didn't get a chance to get his picture

521
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,800
They had people doing KOF like cosplay

522
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:06,240
you know there's part of their thing and I walked right past someone who was K and he was hot and I was like

523
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,780
And he went outside to have a spoke

524
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:17,780
So there you have it, your first booth stud report. So there you go. Alright, final thoughts everybody. Loki.

525
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:30,780
Well, let's see. My final thought is I got to see a donkey and I took my picture with Mario even though I didn't want to.

526
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:38,780
And tomorrow I'm just looking forward to kind of going home because I'm tired.

527
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:45,700
And my final thought is thank you one up calm for the mango smoothie that I didn't have to pay five dollars for

528
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:50,300
Mine is I

529
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:53,500
Really really really really we

530
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:57,800
