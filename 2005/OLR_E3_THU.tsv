29056	31157	DarkSakura, Jamie Summers DarkSakura, Jamie Summers
57405	67429	First off, go figure, neither of the hotels we're staying at, because we're actually across two separate hotels, the three of us, neither of them have Wi-Fi access, so that does us no good there.
67789	75652	And then the internet cafe that is up the street from where Loki and I are staying was closed yesterday, and we were thinking, oh, we'll just upload it over there.
75972	76612	No, they're closed.
76652	81033	So we had to wait, and today we uploaded it from the E3 Business Center, so we finally got it up there.
81394	85195	So you guys actually won't hear this until Friday morning, so we apologize for that delay.
86216	93325	But, you know, it happens, and we're still bringing you the coverage faster than 99.9% of the other sites out there on the internet.
93345	94426	So we're really excited about that.
94446	100874	And we also want to give a big thank you to Jason, our webmaster, who is helping us out on the other end and getting these podcasts to you guys.
100894	101875	Yay, Jason!
101895	102436	Yay!
102837	103117	All right.
103829	105271	So let's talk about Thursday.
105331	106913	How are you guys feeling after today?
106993	109535	Two-thirds of the showdown, only Friday to go.
109876	114601	Today is the longest day of E3 as well, going from 9 o'clock in the morning to 6 o'clock in the evening.
115021	116503	I know Loki and I were there all day.
116583	117845	Jamie, did you get there at 9 o'clock too?
118886	121689	Got there around 10-something actually because we went to breakfast.
123683	124044	Not us.
124184	125505	We kind of skipped breakfast.
125525	129569	We actually ended up eating pizza at about 11.30 or so.
129649	130590	No, even before that.
130810	131931	It was like 10.30 or something?
132232	132892	It was about 10.30.
133613	144644	And the reason behind that is if you don't eat at E3 super early in the day or super late in the day, you will be waiting in line for a long time as LankyStyle from the other show and I
145044	155666	found out on Wednesday we waited in line for like 45 minutes to get an $8 hamburger and fries which is like even worse quality than you'd get at Burger King.
156146	160027	So that's one thing if you guys are planning on going to E3 in the future.
160387	162787	Eat early, eat late, or sneak your food in.
162807	163127	I don't know.
164148	164628	You know what?
164808	167308	I actually ate a hamburger too just without the bun.
167508	168288	She gave me two patties.
168308	169689	I had a cheeseburger.
171049	172229	And it was still $8 though, right?
173735	175283	Yeah, but I got twice as much food as you did
176680	180563	Also, I want to just say to you guys real quick, we are having another technical difficulty night.
180603	186587	We actually only have one microphone, so if you have a couple of clanks and weird volume things, it's just because we're passing it back and forth.
186647	191871	But again, we want to bring you guys the up-to-the-minute news, so we're just kind of making do with it.
191991	192512	Anyway, Loki.
193612	204460	Also, remember, if you're coming to E3 to buy food, bring cash, because I don't know why, but after about a couple hours after they open, they're just like, you know, we don't want to have to worry about...
206744	209625	doing our credit cards and whatnot.
209745	211766	So, to hell with it.
212166	215087	And you're screwed because you have your food and you're like, oh, can I pay the credit?
215728	215968	No.
217008	217528	Aw, crap.
218909	220289	Then you're stuck in that awkward moment.
220970	221970	Luckily, I always bring cash.
224229	226251	Just one of the fun things.
227412	233676	One other thing I've got to say about all that is, you notice that around the LA Convention Center, there is no fast food whatsoever.
233936	236678	No McDonald's, no Burger King, within a reasonable walking distance.
236778	237098	Nothing.
237519	240261	You think they do that on purpose so that you're kind of forced to eat those?
240381	243843	I heard they chased away a hot dog vendor today, too, that wasn't licensed.
244283	245264	They fear competition.
246905	250688	You buy their overpriced, crappy butt food.
252148	253309	All right, enough talk about food.
253349	253949	I'm sorry, guys.
253969	255130	Let's move on to the games.
255170	256751	The games are what we really want to talk about.
257571	258972	Let's do what we did yesterday.
259032	264035	Let's talk about three interesting games that we saw today at E3, three things we played and enjoy.
264395	266356	Let's go around and start with Loki, three games.
267168	267648	Actually, no, wait.
267728	268609	You stole mine yesterday.
268629	269469	I'm starting off today.
270149	272470	Three games I played today that I enjoyed.
272630	277011	First off, Castlevania DS I actually checked out today and thought it was pretty cool.
277071	281093	I like the way that you can kind of draw to defeat the boss.
281133	282113	It was kind of interesting.
282673	296238	A lot of DS games to date, they've relied solely on the touch, I think, the touch element of the game, whereas Castlevania DS, it was a Castlevania game like you'd see on the Game Boy Advance with your map or subscreen shown at the top.
296678	297779	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
314233	317377	Which was interesting, it was different, but some of the songs in it were really weird.
317717	322163	Like, the song I played was Headstrong, and I don't even remember who sings that, because I don't listen to mainstream music.
322563	325106	But, um... Headstrong, yeah, whatever.
326108	328891	So it was weird to hear that in Donkey Konga, though, of all things.
329432	329812	And then, um...
332963	333664	I'm trying to think what else.
333704	335346	Oh yes, one pleasant surprise.
336086	342252	The first thing I saw this morning over at Midway's booth, I played Mortal Kombat Shaolin Monks, which I wasn't sure what to expect from that.
342292	348378	I thought it was just going to be another Mortal Kombat game, but it's more like Mortal Kombat in the, I don't know if this is a fair comparison.
348678	353399	But in the Devil May Cry sense, where you're walking around and you're just, like, beating things up.
353859	363021	But it's kind of cool because if you pick up a weapon, like, in Total Mortal Kombat style, you're lobbing off heads and arms and all that fun stuff, and you get to do fatalities.
363341	366082	I was actually really pleasantly surprised with Mortal Kombat Shalamus.
366122	368262	It's actually one of those few games I see that I'm like, you know what?
368302	369683	I'm going to have to buy this when it comes out.
370003	373963	But, of course, I've always been kind of a Mortal Kombat fan, I guess.
374424	375664	So those are my three.
375744	375944	Loki.
376984	378505	It was Mortal Kombat of War.
379146	379987	That's what it was.
380367	383169	Because everyone's got to do the God of War, Devil May Cry game.
383309	385571	Even Disney, but I haven't played that one yet.
386372	391396	Is that That's So Raven 2, where Raven Simones just starts coming out and kicking the crap out of everybody?
392356	392797	You wish.
392857	395939	Now that would be the Nightmare Before Christmas game.
398581	400063	Raven Simones and Nightmare Before Christmas?
400083	400163	Yeah.
400703	401704	It's just like driving in LA for reals.
428135	430237	It was unclear where the hell you're supposed to be going.
430297	445873	You actually had to look at your map and look at these checkpoints that they had that resembled something from either, say, Grand Theft Auto during your checkpoint race missions or whatever, or Midnight Club, the original Midnight Club, where you have this beam of light coming.
446534	449697	So you see it off in the distance, but you're like, how the hell do I get there?
450397	451678	and a lot of times I got lost.
452058	453818	It was just not fun in that sense.
454299	458640	And the other annoying thing is every time you get in a high-speed car crash, they do a slow-mo instant replay.
459600	460861	Annoying as hell.
461201	463282	Yeah, sure, ooh, it looks cool, but guess what?
463362	466523	You're not Burnout, so stop trying to be like Burnout, okay?
466763	467263	You're L.A.
467343	467603	Rush.
467943	471145	San Francisco Rush, you know, unrealistic, you know, loops and stuff.
471525	472965	That is what I expect from L.A.
473045	473265	Rush.
473686	474626	That's not what I got.
475768	476489	Shadow of the Hedgehog
506189	510714	I was, once again, not very impressed by the hands and feet mode.
510874	511995	I thought it was retarded.
512015	514458	No, no, no, no.
514518	516180	You're just pissed off because you failed your song.
516460	521186	And you're also pissed off that when I played in the heat of the night expert into hands and feet mode that I got a crowd.
521426	523168	So, you know, don't go there.
523683	525044	DarkSakura, your big three from today, Thursday
552341	553563	My big three.
553723	557708	Well, I'm not, you know, I looked at a whole bunch of stuff.
558229	559050	I played a few.
560212	563376	I have to completely just gush over Kingdom Hearts 2.
564978	566340	Oh, it was Kingdom Hearts 2.
567261	568082	It was so cool.
568903	580488	Now, are you gushing because it's Kingdom Hearts, or are you gushing like everybody made this giant gush sound in the Squeenix show when you saw that Johnny Depp as, what was his character in Pirates of the Caribbean?
580568	581928	I didn't see the movie, I have to be honest.
582469	583189	I don't get out much.
583429	585650	Yeah, thank you, Jack Sparrow is actually in Kingdom Hearts.
585710	588191	Everybody made this big gush when Jack Sparrow came on screen.
588911	591472	Spoiler, thank you, I was gonna go to that tomorrow.
595034	595554	You bitch.
597386	599207	It was on the internet before they showed it.
600747	604288	I usually spend my internet time reading world news and events, sir.
605428	606129	Thank you.
608409	609189	It was an event.
611490	615191	It was an event the way that me waking up in the morning and farting is an event.
616932	621953	Are you looking up world events like, oh no, Ben Affleck got Jennifer Garner pregnant, oh my lord.
622713	624814	No, that's your Yahoo, not mine.
626425	627646	I've seen your Yahoo.
628666	631828	Your Yahoo is Britney Spears is knocked up!
633049	637131	Yeah, sorry, I have Ben Affleck dot com feeding right into my Yahoo.
637632	637892	Bitch.
638532	640493	My Yahoo just is depressing every day.
641214	642054	War!
642795	643695	Okay, anyway.
646197	647978	You had to find out someday, I'm sorry.
648278	649058	I'm sorry.
649238	650079	I'm making pouty faces.
650159	651320	I was gonna find out tomorrow.
651820	652280	Give me a dollar.
654241	655162	Anyway, anyway, anyway.
655666	663271	Kingdom Hearts 2 is pretty, and it's very, I mean, it's really, it retains the same graphic style.
663651	668234	I mean, it's pretty much on with the last one, except you can tell it does more in subtle ways.
669355	670976	First of all, I have to mention this.
671236	672597	This is what made me really bouncy.
672877	674478	I went over to Squenix.
675399	676119	No pictures!
676420	677160	No pictures!
677500	680422	No, we're gonna hide the game from the world.
681443	684405	And I haven't seen a single other booth say you can't take pictures.
685871	688412	Um, PlayStation did the same thing.
689833	690613	Well, F them both.
691773	692033	Yeah.
692634	695435	Anyway, so I trot over to Buena Vista today.
695575	699276	I look around, no one's there, so I start playing and take a picture.
699576	706279	Guy's like, I'll play for you while you take pictures and I'll show you the cool shit so you can take pictures of them.
707506	709628	And I wanted to actually get his name and everything.
709648	711830	He's like, no, I don't actually work for Buena Vista.
712010	713131	I'm more of a correspondent.
713211	716274	So I said, I'll credit you as that nice guy at the Buena Vista booth.
716314	717275	So thank you, nice guy.
719516	725842	Anyway, he showed me you can actually fuse with other characters in your party.
726262	729285	And actually, it's really cool when you fuse with Goofy because you get the valor.
729305	730085	Spoiler!
730106	730626	That was a spoiler!
732167	732568	Okay.
733548	733809	Bitch.
735438	742800	You get the Valor, and he wears this red outfit, and he wields two Keyblades.
743701	745921	And that was pretty cool, and he's got all this power.
746621	752343	And he did the Mulan level, he did the level where Hades is trying to kick your ass, but the Mulan level was cool.
752898	756321	Because, you know the scene where, who was the bad guy in Mulan?
756801	757882	I don't remember his name.
758242	761084	But, you know, he comes over the hill and there's a few of his army there.
761464	762325	And they're like, oh, okay.
762365	762905	And they rush.
762985	764907	And then a bajillion of them rush over the hill.
765667	767789	Well, instead it was a bunch of the Heartless.
769016	794524	and we're talking like there were easily several hundred on the screen at that time attacking you and you just have to outlast the clock at this point but there and I've got several pictures of it they're gonna be online when we get back unless somebody is kind enough to take them back beforehand but there was just so many on screen I was really impressed I mean I
795598	797002	Hi, we are all over the place.
797122	799047	We are yellow and ugly and we're trying to kick your ass.
799528	800089	That type of thing.
800731	801753	So that was really cool.
801814	803919	And then I got to get into one of the media events.
804972	811776	I got, because I went over there, because I talked about Call of Cthulhu the other night, when we did our last actual podcast.
811856	819141	So, I had, I found out where Bethesda was, and I was like, you know, I like, I've been looking at this Call of Cthulhu thing, and it looks pretty groovy.
819621	821582	It's like, well, okay, come on in.
822082	827846	And so I sat there with the other press people, and the guy was playing through it, and I was like, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.
828346	835013	Call of Cthulhu looks cool, but the best thing about it, visually, it's about 80% done.
836195	839779	Actually, I got some more stats on it.
839999	842402	I do believe he said out in either August or September.
843423	844704	You have an insanity meter.
845365	847988	Basically, the main character was a policeman who went insane.
848849	851531	And then he got out of the asylum and became a detective.
852151	866824	Well, when you see shocking images, like in one scene there was a ghoul pinned to a cross in this church, or when you're being chased, your insanity level goes up.
867385	870307	And your screen starts getting wavy, you start getting tunnel vision.
870828	872149	And then you hallucinate!
872843	878643	There's one scene where he's running down a tunnel, all of a sudden he's running through the halls of the asylum he was trapped in.
879480	887883	Or when you enter a new scene, if your insanity level is high enough, then you get flashes of where all the enemies in the area are.
888704	890324	And he says there's two ways of doing each level.
890364	894386	You can do it the right way, the sneaky way that, you know, takes a little bit longer.
895346	898007	Or you can just rush through everything, guns blazing.
898287	901228	Actually, he said that the sneaky way actually tends to be a little bit shorter.
901729	903589	But I'll have more information on that.
903609	904650	I'm going to do a write-up on it.
904870	907171	You can all see it on OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
907491	907911	Plug, plug.
908791	912114	and hear me gush about it on Pump Up the Volume later on.
913475	915557	So Kingdom Hearts 2, Call of Cthulhu, you got one more?
916938	918399	Oh shit, you said three, right?
922342	923663	The Cybersex Game!
925145	927407	Actually, no, I didn't say that.
930429	932230	But you guys were just funny about it.
932270	934112	Matt was funny about it because I was like,
934718	938560	Let me get into the next topic, because I know we want to talk next about... Oh, wait, you thought of another one?
939400	945403	I still have to go back and say that Shadow the Hedgehog was pretty groovy-looking.
946103	947744	Oh, no, I know what it was, my other game.
948624	949745	Gunstar Super Heroes.
950325	952606	Because it's just Gunstar Heroes, and that's all.
954387	959109	Alright, well, Jamie spoiled a little bit of our next segment the most int... Spoiler!
959189	960450	Oh my OMG!
960530	961310	Spoiler, spoiler!
961330	962471	Bite my ass!
963300	968695	Okay, so what I want to talk about now is the most interesting moment of your E3 day.
968895	971442	So I'll start with Loki since this got spoiled, OMG.
973058	974359	I was gonna talk about that?
974579	974900	Oh, well.
975320	982486	Anyways, um, yeah, so, I went to this one booth that they had there, it was right next to X-Tango, which is the game we talked about last year.
982846	986089	It was pretty cool, so it's a tango music game, sort of like Bust a Move.
986809	994856	Anyways, and, um, now there's this, like, cybersex game called, uh, oh man, Feel Free.
995837	997658	And, anyways, um, so basically...
998760	1004881	The game, I don't really know what the premise was because I only got to see it for a very brief time.
1007149	1012992	And so, basically, you had... It sort of reminded me of The Sims, but you had different things.
1013353	1016134	You were kind of controlling the girl you were talking to or something.
1016634	1021257	And so you could, like, you know, the guy would start dancing and you'd click D or whatever to make her dance.
1021317	1025279	And then you could do different, like, provocative dance stuff.
1025359	1030362	And then he's like, oh, he's all... Because there's this Asian guy that spoke no English.
1030402	1033224	He's all real brief English.
1033444	1033904	And he's like...
1034504	1059631	Click here to see, it takes her top off, okay, so I clicked, I clicked here, it took her top off, I'm like, oh, that's kind of cool, so he was just letting me play around with it, so I clicked their shorts, or her mini skirt, and then that came off, and then all hell broke loose, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, that's illegal, no, no, no, and then, so they had, like, someone come over to translate, and she's like, no, you can't do that, because it's, it's illegal, or something like that, I'm like, okay,
1061306	1064548	One other thing I thought was interesting about that game, and I don't remember the name of it.
1064588	1065489	Does anybody recall?
1065529	1066630	It's on my camera somewhere.
1066650	1068171	We'll post more information on the site.
1068251	1069692	Field 3, I think was the name of it.
1070092	1072134	Was it Cyber Entertainment was the name of the booth, I think?
1072794	1074796	It's important, but this is the other thing.
1075216	1080600	So not only is it like a cyber sex sim, it has webcam windows in the upper left and upper right.
1080980	1085203	So you can go virtual, and you can go like...
1086042	1088745	Really virtual, like, really interactive.
1089105	1093609	It's kind of scary because there's people that are really going to benefit from this game, and that makes me sad a bit.
1094390	1098013	I'm thinking one person controls the guy, the other one controls the girl.
1098033	1099054	That's what it seems like.
1099274	1104339	You do understand when this game comes out, they're both going to be controlled by guys, whether you know it or not.
1105640	1107181	You can tell there's the camera.
1107221	1108142	That's why they have it.
1108242	1109563	It's the dude camera.
1110004	1112026	Nothing a wig and a little makeup can't hide.
1113616	1122291	Nothing than holding a photo up in front of your webcam Yeah, I'll just loop this Jenna Jameson footage I taped off the TV a little while ago
1123993	1126554	DarkSakura, the most interesting thing you saw today.
1126574	1128655	Or interesting experience.
1158269	1160569	I got to play with the Katamari today.
1161289	1167611	And I got to put our media sampler on the Katamari and then you got to put the reject false icon sticker on there for me.
1167691	1169252	It made me feel like a happy fan.
1170532	1171772	It was the Katamari!
1172312	1177834	And then I got to climb all over stuff and actually get into media stuff without actually being media passes.
1178254	1178734	That was pretty cool.
1180456	1185700	And you know, when I put your sticker on the Katamari, they actually gave me a Katamari Damacy 2 mouse pad.
1185920	1189302	Well, they gave me another one because I went back to play the game with Miklatov.
1189342	1190403	I went back to play it again later.
1190423	1191263	They gave me a second one.
1191584	1195846	So I'm thinking about maybe doing a little giveaway in the near future for one of our lucky fans.
1195866	1196227	We'll see.
1197488	1201951	Actually, now that I remember, there's actually something else that I was going to say was my most interesting moment.
1202831	1203552	That was my massage.
1205677	1210799	I went out, well, I got the free one, the Tylenol Ouch booth thing, and that was all cool.
1210839	1214900	And the guy worked on my hip, you know, because I was in that car accident, and I was really in pain.
1215720	1218521	But I went back after, this is about an hour after my bike had been kicked in.
1220202	1224263	But I went back and paid for like a 25-minute full massage.
1225103	1231105	And my masseur was an actual stand-up comedian.
1232210	1235193	So when he was giving me my foot run, he was making me laugh.
1235934	1237295	Welcome to L.A., everybody.
1239997	1247524	But I like what he said, that making somebody laugh is a serious business.
1248525	1249887	And we got to talking about how...
1252892	1263915	Yeah, but we got to a discussion on how if you live your life all stressed out and you don't laugh and you don't do anything for yourself, you're going to die, okay?
1263975	1271217	You're just going to get cancer of the lower intestine and die not able to shit on your own.
1274558	1278599	What a pleasant image to paint for all these people who are tuning in to hear the latest game news.
1278659	1279080	Thank you.
1279480	1280260	Well, no, no, no, no.
1285679	1303270	Those of us who take time to enjoy our lives, take time to laugh, take time to play games, stress relief, have some leisurely time, those are the people who are generally going to have a happier outlook and who are going to live longer lives, at least unless a car hits them.
1305266	1307329	Point and laugh, it'll add five years to your life
1324403	1325464	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1343977	1346858	In some ways it's a little more fun, but it can also be a lot of work.
1347058	1348999	I've been on that side of it studying in colleges.
1349019	1349719	I know it's a lot of work.
1350219	1357362	But my dad really, really likes it because he's been following the screensavers ever since it was Leo Lepore and then it transitioned and transitioned.
1357422	1358342	He's moved along with it.
1358382	1359582	Now it's this attack of the show.
1359622	1363544	So I was like, okay, my dad's really excited for me to be here.
1363864	1364424	Aw, moment.
1364704	1366085	So I'm going to go get him an autograph.
1366125	1367605	So I went and I got him an autograph.
1368025	1373467	And I told Sarah Lane while I had him on because they were nice and they chatted up with us a little bit while we were each kind of waiting for our autograph.
1373823	1376785	And Sarah Lane asked me and said, you know, how are you?
1376845	1380827	And I said, oh, fine, you know, I'm getting this from my dad, if you can make it out to him.
1381067	1384148	And he has a little bit of a crush on you, which, you know, is kind of nice.
1384809	1390892	And she goes, oh, uh-huh, well, thank you, Alan, wink wink, because that's Alan's, my dad's name.
1391412	1395514	And I'm like, I would have been all like, dude, I swear it's not me, I'm gay.
1395734	1397215	But I didn't want to make an awkward moment.
1397255	1398497	You know, it might have been an awkward moment.
1398637	1401920	Hi, guys, if you're listening, because Matt ended up slipping something.
1402841	1406504	Hello, your name tag doesn't say Alan.
1407064	1409767	I mean, hi, Alan.
1409947	1411569	Yeah, Alan's my stage name.
1412550	1415652	I think she was just trying to be cute, so I totally respect her for that.
1416013	1420377	But, yeah, it was kind of one of those things where it's like, you know, I could...
1421303	1422004	Thank you for watching!
1437097	1446713	I thought G4's booth, all things considered, because they've taken a lot of heat ever since the tech TV, I thought they actually had kind of an interesting booth where you could kind of play the actual Nintendo and everything.
1447033	1449497	And then Matt ended up seizing this opportunity.
1449538	1451381	What did you do, Matt, while we were in line for that?
1452159	1458461	Well, you were talking to her about what Orange Lounge Radio was, so I figured I'd just help clarify.
1459302	1460522	They asked!
1460982	1472366	So, while I was having Kevin Pira and Sarah Lane signing the picture that they gave me here, I gave them one of our media samplers for our podcast.
1472426	1480129	So, hello, Kevin and Sarah, or Kevin and Sarah's interns, whoever it may be that might possibly listen to the show.
1481209	1483351	or Kevin and Sarah's trash can for all we know.
1483371	1483951	I mean, who knows?
1484531	1490115	Yes, the bum row machine outside the trash picking up a CD thinking it's something valuable.
1490415	1492476	No, they're really cool and the booth is pretty cool.
1492696	1499600	In the past, I've given G4 a little bit of criticism.
1499800	1500681	But hey, really?
1500781	1504443	I figured out who the real villain of this everything is.
1504743	1509506	It's all Comcast because it's all their fault that my cable never works.
1510520	1514983	Let's face it kids, we haven't said anything everyone else on the internet hasn't already said.
1515243	1516764	Sorry, it's just, you know, anyway.
1517724	1522027	Oh, and we got filmed for some TV thing too, but I don't know, I don't remember what it was.
1522927	1525028	We were filmed as bumpers for...
1526449	1527089	What was it?
1527129	1528130	G4TV.com.
1528190	1537814	So if you find a rerun or happen to see G4TV.com, their E3 coverage, you will see us as a commercial intro or whatever.
1538215	1542537	So you'll see us yelling and screaming because that's what we were told to do.
1543017	1549940	Also, we got to play with the 8-foot Nintendo controller that they built, which is cool.
1550380	1552761	And I'm dedicated now to build one that's larger.
1552781	1554082	Yeah.
1554901	1556222	Just because I have to.
1557083	1558904	Another one of those projects you'll never finish.
1559084	1563308	Alright, so tomorrow is the last day of E3.
1563388	1565109	What are you guys' plans?
1565149	1567812	Something you definitely have to check out tomorrow at E3 with the last day.
1568873	1570514	Sitting in the Sony line for three hours.
1572042	1572823	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1590163	1593905	And I realize, you know, a lot of folks are like, boy, E3 is so glamorous.
1593925	1595705	You get to play all the latest and greatest games.
1595945	1596606	And don't get me wrong.
1596666	1597306	It's pretty cool.
1597326	1600327	We're very lucky to be able to go to E3 and we're having a good time overall.
1600367	1603729	But to play the really good stuff, you guys, it's like going to Disneyland.
1603769	1609591	If you want to ride the nice ride, you got to sit in line for three hours and, you know, for that five minute thrill.
1609631	1611712	It's kind of, you know, too bad.
1612837	1621507	I'm still going to be getting up at 7 and trying to be over there by, well, they start at 9.
1622308	1624050	Try to be over there by like a quarter till.
1624070	1628696	What do you think you're most looking forward to doing tomorrow, Loki?
1630287	1632108	Going home, to be honest.
1632649	1635191	I mean, honestly, I'm done with the show right now.
1636491	1639974	I thought the whole line at Nintendo's booth was to see the revolution.
1640194	1643817	Then when I found out it's just to play the stupid Zelda game, I was like, ah, the hell with that.
1643917	1644777	I'm not staying there.
1645238	1647679	I'll go see Sony because at least they're going to show the PS3.
1647900	1651402	Nintendo, oh, wow, you show us your ugly system, but nothing that does.
1651903	1657507	You hype it up and you don't come through and say, here's a little Game Boy Advance.
1657607	1658307	Come play it.
1658407	1659228	I'm like, ugh.
1663030	1669793	I have to kind of retract something I said yesterday.
1669853	1673175	I actually got the DS download thing in Nintendo to work better for me today.
1673275	1676157	And I still have Meteos on my DS because I put it in sleep mode.
1676417	1677277	So that's kind of cool.
1677317	1679398	So I feel a little better about the DS download thing now.
1680479	1682940	I'm going to have to go back then and get Electroplankton.
1684021	1684581	Electroplankton.
1686044	1687925	Honestly, no one would make E3 a lot better.
1688266	1689807	It would make it harder to get into.
1690427	1693970	Because everybody is just coming in no matter what.
1694450	1700035	Some people that are sort of in the industry, those are the people that are coming in.
1700755	1707860	Granted, we are sort of in the industry, but there are some people that really are like, I work for Kmart.
1708281	1709642	Kmart sells video games.
1709782	1710943	Therefore, I get in.
1710963	1711243	Yeah.
1711969	1712649	Thanks for watching!
1732734	1733054	DarkSakura.com
1753917	1781162	which is dumb, I mean, like, I don't even understand some of these smaller companies, like, you know, for example, oh, who's the company that does, not Crave, but, like, it's just like some of the stuff in Kentia Hall, you know, you can't even see the company stuff because it's just in, behind these closed doors and stuff, it's like, oh, wow, you know, I figure, I'd figure, yeah, Gravity, for example, I'd figure a small company like that, I'd be like, hey, check out our stuff, come and check out our stuff,
1781642	1788591	You know, whereas you got cocky people like Rockstar M that, you know, they're just like, ah, our stuff is too good for you.
1789032	1792656	You'll see it and you'll buy it when it comes out the end, you know.
1792856	1794619	And to be honest, that is the truth.
1794679	1797462	People will buy it because their stuff sells good.
1797963	1800426	And, you know, you can't really compete with that.
1800945	1813514	And whereas you think they would want people, the everyday other person to see it, like the folks at Kmart that work there or whatever, to see it and create the buzz, they kind of don't have to do that, sadly enough, because the media creates the buzz for them.
1813954	1821799	Well, you know, on a more grassroots level, as far as what we've seen, the buzz for us is all about things that were very easily accessible with very little lines.
1822159	1827103	We Heart Katamari, for example, is one of my favorite things I've seen at the show so far, and a lot of that is because...
1827563	1832486	It was easy to play and I could sit there for a while with it and really look into it and I had a great time with it.
1833266	1836568	It's just like stuff like Unreal 2007 or whatever it is.
1837468	1839369	I really don't care about that because you know what?
1839930	1844132	I'm not going to wait in line for an hour to see video that's going to be on the internet the next day.
1844707	1845388	Dan played it.
1845428	1846769	Controls are exactly the same.
1846789	1848870	Like Ocarina, like Wind Waker, they're both the same.
1874890	1881753	But the thing about it though is that he did say that it was pretty cool, but he got to meet Miyamoto.
1883654	1889197	Yeah, so he said that he would have been pissed had he gone and not got to meet Miyamoto.
1889597	1890917	So I was like, whoo, Miyamoto.
1891458	1894219	I get to touch Dan and he got to meet Miyamoto.
1896670	1900594	The other thing we saw today that was pretty cool was the Atari Flashback 2.0.
1900935	1903978	It's awesome in its wood graininess.
1905019	1906120	I can't wait to try that.
1906601	1908783	It's not big like the old Atari.
1908923	1909684	It's rather little.
1909764	1915471	It's like about the size of an 8x10 piece of paper, maybe even smaller, but it's wood grain and it's cute.
1915531	1916712	It's so cute and precious.
1917358	1920179	Someone also showed me a brand new Nintendo system that someone made.
1920239	1923660	It's like a third-party company created a new system that plays Nintendo games.
1924861	1931603	And their brand new system, I guess, is because I didn't know there was this huge demand for Nintendo systems, but I don't know.
1932364	1935605	So they made them, and they're top-loading, just like the revised version.
1936630	1945282	Well, you know what has made a striking absence, given all the hype around it, is Namco versus Capcom.
1945743	1947145	Ex-Capcom, however they're doing.
1947445	1949068	Wouldn't that be cross-Capcom then?
1949488	1949709	Anyway.
1950467	1952788	But at any rate, or Namco by Capcom.
1953728	1956049	Anyway, we went to Capcom to go ask them about it.
1956069	1957890	Capcom was like, go talk to Namco.
1958130	1959610	So we trot over to Namco.
1960010	1963592	Well, no, at first I asked this one guy, I was like, you should ask the info desk here.
1963632	1966053	Have an ad for Final Fight.
1966093	1967353	I'm like, ooh, another Final Fight sticker.
1967473	1968153	And then we went over.
1968954	1970274	Because I like Final Fight.
1971114	1977317	And then we trotted over there and started talking to this guy at the Namco booth.
1977417	1978457	His name was Matt.
1979286	1980126	He was really cool.
1980586	1983847	And he's like, yeah, well, we don't have any information on it.
1983907	1986568	And I was like, yeah, Capcom just said, go talk to Namco.
1986688	1987468	So we did.
1987548	1988969	And he was really cool, though.
1988989	1991990	But he's been following it online like the rest of us have.
1992070	1993690	And we're all excited.
1993950	1995371	But they don't have anything official right now.
1996091	1996431	You know what?
1996451	1998472	You're totally starting like a seventh grade war.
1998812	2002273	Because you're going to one person saying, this person's saying you got it.
2002333	2006754	And then you went to the other one and said, hey, Capcom, Namco's saying to you, I know, I'm teasing you.
2007227	2010549	That is not what I said at all, because I don't do petty shit like that.
2010949	2011690	That's not cool.
2014011	2017473	Basically, whenever I was like, we don't know, go talk to them.
2018033	2025618	I have to say, though, in comparison, Namco's people have been a lot friendlier than Capcom's people.
2026818	2029820	I've gone to some booths and just gotten complete and total apathy.
2030280	2032762	You're there to sell a damn product.
2033042	2034663	Freaking act like it, okay?
2035023	2036504	You are there to market yourselves.
2036524	2038685	You're there to make people want to do business with you.
2038725	2040326	It is a fucking trade show.
2041466	2046108	You know, Namco, and you know I have lots of love for Namco.
2047028	2053051	They have gone out of their way to make the people visiting their area feel welcome.
2054071	2062295	They've had people running around with little Pac-Man hats on, handing out squishy things, which they actually ran out of when I went to go play the Namco mobile games.
2063115	2064857	But they'll talk to you.
2065837	2067619	And they know what they're talking about.
2067679	2071902	The people are there because they truly enjoy doing what they're doing.
2072283	2076806	They're not there to be a piece of ass in a scrap of leather like the Booth Babes.
2078568	2079328	Sorry, it's true.
2079429	2085173	They're TNA in a quarter centimeter of leather.
2086755	2087035	You know...
2087904	2090205	But they've really gone out of their way.
2090265	2090885	And Nintendo.
2091485	2093046	Nintendo's people have been great.
2095267	2099808	I got to talk to one of their representatives there.
2100208	2102389	And he was just as friendly as he could be.
2102989	2104670	And saying, yeah, you should check this out.
2104690	2105610	And they're doing this.
2105730	2110372	And the guys handing out stuff when I played Nintendo, that guy was funny.
2110732	2113533	And he gave me a bunch of styluses.
2117113	2145264	you know me and my grammar but it was those I have to say were just the nicest people and the Korean guys at Xtango they were like play with us it's fun just in comparison it's amazing the differences between the attitude of people and when you go to the places that make you feel like your business is welcome then that's where I'll get my business
2145922	2149404	I've thrown a good word for Konami, too, because they've always been really good to us, of course.
2149484	2154046	But it's kind of different with them because we actually kind of know a lot of the people at this point that work at the booth.
2154106	2160029	So, you know, just because, obviously, we started as a music and rhythm game station, so, you know, we've kind of grown ties there.
2160970	2164891	Well, I actually didn't mention Konami just for that reason.
2164911	2173856	You know, the fact that, you know, that's almost like saying that your cousin's a good worker when you hired, you know,
2175393	2177037	But I don't know everyone there.
2177077	2180466	I mean, I sound like a real pompous ass saying that, but I don't know everyone there.
2180506	2184215	And even the folks I don't know are pretty nice and ask if I have questions and stuff.
2185362	2191465	Yeah, it's kind of hard when the people up on the stage of Bad Beat Mania are friends of yours.
2192525	2203350	Of course you expect to be friendly from your friends, but I'm just saying for the other people, the ones we don't know as well, just seeing that difference in attitude, Capcom was just apathy.
2204011	2207332	Playing out, we don't want to be here, we're bored, end the con.
2208193	2211154	And I can't handle that.
2211681	2218382	I actually had kind of a weird experience at Capcom last year, and it's kind of made me not just... I kind of walked by their booth, and I was like, man, is there anything I want to see?
2218902	2219242	Not really.
2219322	2220483	Ooh, beautiful Joe Coffey.
2221423	2222103	Not worth waiting for.
2223423	2224743	No, the guy there, though, he was cool.
2225383	2226504	I chatted with him a little bit.
2226544	2229104	He stood back so I could take a picture of the machine.
2229124	2230364	That was really awesome.
2230784	2231805	Told me when to come back.
2232825	2233365	He was cool.
2233905	2238986	And the guy by Final Fight, he said what he knew, but the press people, the people at the desk...
2240024	2240985	That's where I had my bad experience.
2241005	2244127	I had this woman laugh in my face last year, one of the people behind the desk.
2244287	2245127	Totally inappropriate.
2246068	2248830	Yeah, but I got a press kit out of him that last year and this year.
2249610	2250691	Well, she can suck it.
2254553	2255414	Well, it's just...
2256874	2257555	DarkSakura.com
2274062	2278384	Yep, so I mean, and this is not something you're going to read about on those big sites.
2278404	2282467	They're not going to tell you the attitudes, the way it really is when you go to E3.
2282527	2284127	People's attitudes at different booths.
2284448	2287549	That's the kind of stuff you're only going to hear here on Orange Lounge Radio.
2287649	2290451	So on that note, I think we're going to wrap it up.
2290651	2293613	I think we've all gotten in what we're going to look at tomorrow, right?
2294973	2297435	Are we going to wrap it up in a scrap of leather like a booth babe?
2298399	2298939	We just might.
2298959	2302681	You know, I tried to find age text booths so I could find the anti-booth babes today.
2303041	2307663	I could only find their little room, and the woman working in the room was an attractive gal.
2307743	2312945	She wasn't a booth babe gal, you know, your stereotypical blonde hair, blue eye, big titty booth babe.
2313285	2315766	But she was an attractive female, you know.
2316246	2321949	So I have to figure out where this anti-booth babe, granny panty campaign is going on.
2322765	2325387	And would you really want to be one of those women?
2325647	2328489	Oh yeah, you're the ugly person that gets to promote our game.
2328929	2329590	Thanks.
2330790	2335013	Yeah, well, we kind of talked about that last Sunday, but... I did.
2335033	2337095	I was sad I didn't get a chance to get his picture.
2337495	2341257	They had people doing KOF, like, cosplay, you know, there as part of their thing.
2341718	2345400	And I walked right past someone who was K, and he was hot.
2345840	2350844	And I was like... And he went outside to have a smoke.
2352139	2355382	So there you have it, your first booth stud report.
2355422	2355942	So there you go.
2356383	2357864	All right, final thoughts, everybody.
2357904	2358164	Loki.
2361547	2362328	Well, let's see.
2362948	2370575	My final thought is I got to see a talking donkey, and I took my picture with Mario, even though I didn't want to.
2372076	2378322	And tomorrow, I'm just looking forward to kind of going home because I'm tired.
2380666	2385889	And my final thought is thank you 1up.com for the mango smoothie that I didn't have to pay $5 for.
2388670	2397855	Mine is I really, really, really, really, really, really love the Katamari and reject false icons.
2399352	2402274	All right, if you guys have any questions, you still have a chance to email us.
2402334	2403855	Deadline, Friday, 4 p.m.
