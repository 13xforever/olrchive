490	4511	Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition live at E3 Wednesday Edition.
6472	14435	You're tuned in to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your podcast home for all the latest video game news and gamer chat.
14655	18096	Now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.
21513	22114	Jamie Summers, Dark Sakura
42290	43372	Hey, hey, the gang's all here.
43752	48459	Alright, so we don't have a whole lot of time tonight because we're trying to run between doing different things, but let's get the lowdown.
48819	51503	Wednesday's show, let's start off with the big news.
52023	57491	A lot of our folks out there want to know about the music games because that's how we started was with the music games, so of course we have...
57851	59492	Dance Dance Revolution Extreme 2.
59532	60853	Loki, what did you think of Extreme 2?
61293	62433	I thought it was pretty cool.
62954	68036	The characters have been cleaned up quite a bit, and also there's new songs to be excited about.
68056	74840	A brand new song, which I cannot remember the title for the life of me, but had a nice, really kick-ass CG background to it.
75720	76540	Nice animation.
77201	78381	It was a pretty cool song, too.
78862	82704	There was some pretty good songs shown off there for that, and...
84144	85045	Thanks for watching!
92651	96213	Also, Genie in a Bottle, a little weird, not Christina Aguilera.
96273	98434	It's a cover version, but it's there nonetheless.
100175	104517	Also, online play was being shown off in the demo, so that is confirmed.
104537	106398	It is going to be there, so that's very exciting.
106458	107018	That is cool.
107118	108839	Anything else you want to point out about Xtreme 2?
110080	110820	The logo looked cool.
111641	112261	It did, it did.
113402	115543	Ultramix 3, another very impressive one.
115603	117604	Very similar to Ultramix 2, I thought.
117944	121705	But with more of like a water theme as opposed to kind of what it had before.
121925	123326	Yeah, it's very water.
123546	130788	It's all like water themed as opposed to like some generic like club rave thing in Ultramix 2.
132009	133109	New Midi Head Remix.
133169	133829	Yeah, very cool.
133889	134650	New Midi Head Remix.
134690	135810	Jelly Kiss showing up in the game.
135830	138171	Jelly Kiss.
138311	140612	Butterfly making its US debut in Ultramix 3.
140652	141252	Butterfly.
141312	142292	And guess what, folks?
142652	144233	For all those people bitching about Ultramix 2...
144973	146413	Sakura's in there!
146433	149934	Sakura made its way to Ultramix 3, as well as Daikinkai, another fan favorite.
149954	152515	Daikinkai made it in there, and Akuma Dracula Medley.
152635	157876	Yeah, Akuma Dracula Medley, very excited about that one, I've been crazy for that one for years, so I'm excited about that.
157936	168159	And then of course, big news, Beatmania, it's not 2DX, they're not calling it 2DX here, but if you guys are fans of 2DX in Japan, they're bringing it over to the USA, Beatmania, here's the coolest thing about it.
168837	176282	If you go into five key mode, typically in Beatmania, going into five key mode will drop the last two keys of seven key mode and you just play the same thing.
176662	177263	Not so here.
177323	180025	You actually get all new five key songs.
180425	180905	It's awesome.
181306	184508	So like what was the Metal Gear Solid theme was in there?
185789	186369	Paranoia.
186869	187770	Very excited about that.
187990	188411	Thanks for watching!
202038	205101	Dancing, also coming to Karaoke Revolution.
205621	210245	Karaoke Revolution Party, Xbox, GameCube, and PlayStation.
210425	211166	Going to be on all three.
211366	211706	All three.
211926	213908	It's dancing and singing, if you want.
213928	215929	You don't have to play, but kind of crazy.
216009	217190	All that stuff going on on the screen at once.
217210	221254	Now, what was really cool is, you've got to go back to Ultramix 3 here.
221554	222915	Quest mode, that was really strange.
223395	228599	It's actually got cities that are actual cities throughout the United States.
228619	228960	You go and...
229440	232082	DarkSakura, what did you think of the music selections available at Konami?
246341	255027	I actually didn't hang around too long, but I tried to play Jelly Kiss, except my hip decided that, hey, you know, your Vicodin hasn't kicked in yet.
255527	259970	So I ended up having to stumble off of it, but I did play Beatmania.
261371	266174	Whatever it was that I played was supposed to be a six star, and it was more like a one.
266895	270477	So I don't think that they're completely up to level yet.
270497	272078	Yeah, it was only an E3 demo.
272359	275721	But I did wander around and check some of the peripherals out.
276441	279142	I tried the one at DDRgame.com.
279942	282383	And their metal pad's pretty decent, but there's a delay on it.
282823	283323	It's cushy.
283964	284884	I played Superstar.
284964	288045	Actually, by then, my medicine had kicked in.
288325	291726	But there's a delay on it, I could tell, because Superstar's one of my old PA ones.
293767	294467	But it wasn't bad.
296323	297003	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
318621	329291	I did talk to the rep there and he said, this is as close to a quote as I can come, he said they are going to continue to market it until there is something actually published in terms of a lawsuit.
330643	333005	For those curious about the lawsuit, it does not involve Red Octane.
333366	340632	If you've read the list that DDR Freak made available, the actual printouts of the suit, Red Octane was never mentioned in it.
340672	342054	So they're going ahead with this release.
342114	344196	So it's good for us in the end.
344636	348260	And we decided to ask them about their other games that have been posted.
348740	349421	Guitar Hero.
349481	350382	Guitar Hero.
351683	354445	And it sounds pretty cool so far.
354506	356007	They had to be very vague on it.
356207	359269	It is going to be 5-key guitar controls, which is very exciting.
380735	386162	DDR with Mario was shown not at Konami though, they showed it over at Nintendo.
387764	390628	Kind of bare bones what I saw, I didn't get to see a whole lot of it.
390648	394513	I'm going to tell you what, I played a song on Very Hard and I triple-ate it my first try.
394912	395973	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
416913	418834	Have you guys ever released a drum peripheral?
418854	421495	And he kind of smelled where I was going with that.
421555	427717	And he's like, I have to be very vague on that, but we're working on something.
427737	429678	You get a nice we'll see from that.
430158	430418	All right.
430738	435340	Now, not everybody that listens to our show is into music games, so let's talk about some of the other things we saw at the show today.
435400	437521	Maybe pick three highlights.
437541	438982	We'll go around and talk about three highlights.
439022	440222	DarkSakura wants to start us off.
441820	445984	I spent a lot of time at Nintendo, so I played Animal Crossing DS.
446484	447185	Lots of fun.
447965	451208	The world itself is very spherical.
451929	455151	You actually feel like you're walking on a small little planet.
455572	459094	I was very impressed because Animal Crossing DS is not just a rehashed GameCube version.
459134	461656	They actually went back and redid all the graphics and the interface.
461897	466000	And at the show, you could play against someone who was sitting in New York City.
466380	468242	And I promised I would give a shout-out, but I forgot her name.
468282	468822	I'm very sorry.
468842	470584	I played against Charles.
471284	471744	The Voice of Mario.
471764	472585	The Voice of Mario.
472605	473205	Mario Kart.
473665	474966	And he called me a lovely lady.
475286	476306	He doesn't know me very well.
476326	477047	That's awesome.
477567	479388	You know, when I met him last year, I said, it's a you.
480288	481869	All right, so Animal Crossing.
482549	483329	It was pretty fun.
483409	486411	I went around twirling my umbrella, which he said I was very good at.
486751	490392	And then he was going around whacking everybody else with the bug catching net.
491033	495855	And he kept chasing the person with the pirate hat because he said it's fun to hit the pirate with the net.
496863	503969	and then I played Pokemon DX, I'm sorry, XD, which actually, I played it just for the plushie.
505049	506330	XD, like the smiley face?
506371	519501	Yeah, but it was actually pretty cool, it's a big ol' RPG, and you play against all the up-to-date Pokemon, you know, it's the typical stadium style battle, but it was really cool.
520194	521955	I actually enjoyed it.
522355	523396	I took a couple pictures.
523876	526758	I took pictures of just about everything I played except for the DS ones.
527898	531020	And actually, I played Nintendogs.
532046	561609	is a cute puppy, because you throw the frisbee, and then they sit on it, and they're stupid, and then you tap the screen, and they're like, oh, you want this, pat on the head, and then you grab it, and then, no, you can't, no, you threw this, you don't keep it anymore, I'm keeping it, says the puppy, no, no, no, no, you're going to give me, because I'm the human, no, says the puppy, I'm going to give, so you pull it out of the puppy, okay, throw it, puppy, and it's like three puppies, and so,
562793	564793	That's a beautiful description of Nintendogs, thank you.
566094	567274	I wonder if they'll have them in tin cats.
568454	569575	I talked to the guy about it.
569995	571955	He's like, you don't really train a cat.
571975	573435	I was like, yeah, the cat trains you.
574756	575856	Human food now.
576816	578617	So that's your three for now, all Nintendo.
578677	579097	That's alright.
579877	584098	Yeah, but one of the fun things was the picto-chatting with random people in the lines.
584258	584698	It was great.
585660	591005	Dude, speaking of random things going on in the line, we were standing next to Gary Coleman this morning and didn't even realize it.
591185	592606	And then Hodeo Kojima walked by.
592627	593287	It was so weird.
594068	598372	And then I stood next to that chick from G4TV.com, the one that's blonde, spiky hair.
598712	600574	Granted, I hate her on TV, but she's still hot.
601551	603112	It's just an on-air thing.
603132	604693	I'm sure she's a nice gal.
604753	606494	She seemed nice when I saw her.
606514	607575	They're all nice, I'm sure.
608716	610737	Fear me, I am your all-knowing host.
610757	611738	They're paid to be weird.
611818	612819	That's why we're not on TV.
612859	614900	We're a little too not weird for TV.
615120	616341	No way, I'm not paid to be weird.
616821	617662	All right, anyway, anyway.
618242	619883	Loki, your three highlights for today.
620023	620304	Okay.
620864	630991	Well, it wouldn't be a show if I didn't start off with, I don't know, let's just start off with Advent Children, which in Square Enix's,
632132	634153	That's how they pronounce it, but it's wrong.
634494	635314	It's Squeenix.
635474	636075	We all know that.
636515	648645	Anyways, in their little rehashed movie thing that they did last year, they have new footage of Advent Children and... Latifah fighting in the cathedral.
649606	650466	Hot.
651387	652268	Freaking hot.
652648	658293	I mean, I know that stuff's going to be on GameSpot later, and I'm sure they're going to have a video for it.
658653	659313	Watch it.
660474	661255	Oh, very hot.
661555	662295	Anyway, so they have that.
662315	662855	That was cool.
664316	672741	The second thing that I actually got to do, which was kind of neat, is I got to try out We Love Katamari, and that was a lot of fun.
673470	674051	I played that too!
674071	674992	I picked up the flowers.
675032	677715	Is it just Mirrors the King's Package even bigger?
692483	694546	I don't know, but it was pretty funny.
695447	699092	Then they had... What else did they play that was really cool?
699773	705560	Oh, well, I got to try a little bit of... I can't remember what the title is.
705580	706922	I can only remember the subtitle.
707042	707403	It's like...
708893	714335	Uh, um, something, something, something, uh, contents under pressure.
714455	718416	It's that, um, tagging game where you actually spray paint buildings and stuff.
718676	726378	I played that for a little bit, but it was weird because I was tagging stuff and all of a sudden, like, SWAT comes with guns and they start shooting at me.
726418	729558	I'm like, that's a little harsh for someone that's just tagging a building.
729678	730819	But Jet Set Radio does that.
731219	732739	Well, it's very similar.
732779	735380	And then, so I had to fight them off with a paint roller and guess what?
735880	736261	DarkSakura
759790	763112	I did take a very up-close picture of one, so that'll be available soon.
763132	765074	As did I. I'm going to get to the mail.
765174	766755	If you have a question for us, hurry up.
766795	767775	You've got to write us right now.
768256	773579	E3 at OrangeLoungeRadio.com And we'll be checking this box, such as these questions that came in from Sunday's show.
773999	775080	And we'll answer these.
775260	778943	If you have something you want us to check into on the show, remember we can't get to everything.
779003	781845	And if you send us a big list, we'll probably only be able to get to one or two.
782145	783346	But we want to try and help you guys out.
783426	786348	Michael N. actually wanted more information on the Game Boy Micro.
786448	786928	What is it?
787408	790271	Game Boy Micro is like a Game Boy Advance, but it's the size of your palm.
790491	791232	It's very small.
791272	792193	This is the coolest thing about it.
792213	797038	You know how we usually bag on Nintendo because they make you buy the same thing five different times to get it in different colors?
797338	802163	Well, the face is detachable, kind of like a car stereo, so you can actually change the face.
802303	806647	They have a red face and a blue face and a baseball-looking face and all these strange things.
806747	808609	Any other impressions on the Game Boy Micro, you guys?
809736	810196	It's little!
810476	813578	I mean, it's supposed to also have, what, double the battery power, too.
814499	814799	Yeah.
814819	817300	So, you can just keep it on indefinitely, maybe?
817320	818661	The screen's, like, half the size.
820482	824664	Honestly, the Game Boy Advance games, I don't think, are that good anymore.
824704	827766	It's just, there's nothing really Game Boy Advance that I really want.
828266	833469	I noticed, though, it's slightly larger than, say, a Game Boy Advance cartridge.
833890	835931	I mean, maybe a bit larger than that, but...
836440	838482	It's just, it looks like a cell phone screen.
839223	843266	I mean, and really... It does, it looks like playing it on a cell phone.
843286	848852	Honestly, it's like if I had a Game Boy Advance SP or original Game Boy Advance, I wouldn't really buy this.
849012	850013	It's cute though, it's cute.
850033	855157	It's cute, but it's like, really, I mean, Game Boy Advance SP, it pretty much fits in your pocket.
855458	858961	Do you really need, I mean, hell, a DS fits in my pocket, so...
859841	860722	Also, voice over IP chat.
880976	881757	There was that too.
882498	887083	Which actually, if anyone's ever seen the commercial, the Cisco commercials, where they have the U.S.
887123	890246	marketing team and the Japanese marketing team and they're playing, they put this phone back on there.
890487	891568	I used to use that phone at work.
891968	898916	It uses your internet line as your phone line, almost kind of like our Skype does, similarly, except it's carried over an internet signal.
900539	909361	Um, Jin sent us a really big list, and, um, I think actually it's Jin4576, I apologize if I screwed up your number, 4576 I think, but, uh, who cares, it's Jin, it's awesome.
909681	911761	Uh, SoulCalibur3, create a character.
912061	918042	You know, the demo was a little skimpy, we only saw Mitsuru Yugi versus one of the new characters, one with a giant chakra, I can't remember her name.
918362	924303	T, I'm really sorry guys, I don't cheat, I don't use papers, I've got, I think it was Tina or Tira, something.
924603	928104	They were the only two playable ones in the demo, didn't see a lot of created characters, sorry to say.
928344	929624	Hopefully we'll know more information on that soon.
930224	934686	One more information also on Final Fantasy XII, CG looks amazing.
934786	937648	I think they went back and retooled it because it looks like Advent Children.
938828	941670	And I think that what they're going to be doing is release it for the PS3.
941690	943291	That's our thought.
943351	950194	That's our thought is that because they weren't showing playable versions of it, but we don't want to start rumors, but we think it almost looks too good to be on PS2.
951395	952315	Either that or it's dev kit.
954005	954906	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
972145	973968	I also saw the classroom one which is pretty cool
987368	990651	Okay, we do have to wrap things up pretty soon here, but any other thoughts?
990671	992433	I'd like to touch on one more thing Katamari-related.
992793	1008306	We saw the giant Katamari that they had there, and it was funny because one of the things that someone had stuck on there is, I don't know if anyone's heard about this, for the Nintendo DS, they had, you know, touching is good thing, and you can actually send in to get your own, you know, mannequin hand.
1008526	1012830	And someone had put the mannequin hand on the large Katamari, and that was hilarious.
1012990	1017112	All right, so if you guys have any other E3 questions, E3 at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
1017152	1019012	Now, before we go, just one other thing real quick.
1019072	1019933	Oh, DarkSakura has a thought.
1021033	1025995	Xtango has more stuff in it and looks awesome, and they are in talks with developers this year.
1027170	1027650	I missed that.
1027690	1028791	I hope to check that one out tomorrow.
1028811	1030211	I saw it briefly as I walked past.
1030231	1031591	I was like, ooh, Xtango's here.
1032312	1034772	I didn't get to spend a lot of time on West Hall or Kenshi today.
1034792	1035773	I'm hoping to spend more time there.
1035933	1040694	No, yeah, I know, and I missed it completely somehow.
1040854	1041174	Let's see.
1041274	1049817	So I just want to go through the thing you were most looking forward to that maybe disappointed you a little bit, because I have something on the top of my mind, and that would be the Nintendo DS download station.
1050397	1056760	I was really looking forward to it, but it was hammered with people, and the rooms were full, and it was hard to get anything on there.
1056880	1060881	But I just went and sat down and used the DSs they had there.
1061482	1063723	And I did get to play Meteos, which was very cool.
1063883	1066584	I'm sad I didn't get to hear the music, though, because I hear the music's very cool.
1066824	1069285	But the game itself, simple yet addicting.
1070245	1071846	I'm looking forward to playing this one in more detail.
1072246	1075047	You guys have any thoughts, things you were looking forward to that maybe disappointed you a little bit?
1077108	1079169	I went in with no expectations, and they were met.
1080427	1081147	Rockstar's Booth
1105781	1107262	And also, I'm very disappointed on swag.
1107282	1108343	Not a lot of swag this year.
1108363	1112545	I beg to differ, because I have Pokemon, and I have t-shirts, and I have press kits, and I have puppies.
1131644	1141112	and also big disappointment to Sony and Nintendo for constantly tripping the breakers there and causing power outages in their little hall there.
1141352	1144815	And also kind of a thumbs down to people wanting you to wait in line for their show.
1144915	1146957	Everybody's got a line and it's a half hour long.
1147077	1147417	Too bad.
1148109	1149029	Thank you for watching!
1162489	1163650	Alright, we're going to wrap it up here.
1164050	1165351	Final thoughts, you guys.
1165391	1165611	Matt?
1166772	1175838	Tomorrow, I'm going to wait in line for Nintendo, and I'm waiting in line to see the PS3, and Xbox can suck it, because in order to play their game, you have to be media.
1176158	1179200	But you can look down upon it on a wonderful platform.
1179220	1180061	Well, to hell with them.
1180321	1180681	You know what?
1180901	1185004	I'm not buying your stupid Xbox 360, so you can shove it, okay?
1185024	1186445	Because I ain't buying that crap.
1186505	1187566	I don't care how good it looks.
1187586	1189647	Views and opinions expressed of Loki do not necessarily...
1189767	1191688	Oh, also, the new console systems are ugly.
1191988	1193209	Except for the Xbox 360.
1193289	1194290	There's irony for ya.
1195030	1198452	Dude, the Xbox 360 show that they did was freaking pretty.
1198812	1200113	Quake 4, ha ha ha ha.
1200373	1201674	Dead or Alive 4, ha ha ha.
1202174	1206477	You know, if I were a man, I would have walked around the whole rest of the con with a big boner the whole time.
1207237	1208458	But I'm not.
1209458	1213661	But my final thought is, I'm kind of pissed off that they wouldn't let me put a Reject False Icon sticker on the Katamari.
1215142	1215802	Aw, that stinks.
1216611	1219854	My final thought is Sony and I are spending some quality time together tomorrow.
1220854	1221175	All right.
