2
00:00:02,592 --> 00:00:13,848
[SPEAKER_01]: You're tuned in to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your podcast home for all the latest video game news and gamer chat.

4
00:00:18,959 --> 00:00:27,910
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello everybody, once again, welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio To Go, that podcast dedicated to what you gamers really want to know about.

5
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:36,620
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know, we like to talk about video games that don't suck on this show, although sometimes we will talk about games that do suck, but only to tell you to stay far, far away.

6
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,082
[SPEAKER_04]: Avoid like the plague.

7
00:00:39,771 --> 00:00:41,833
[SPEAKER_04]: Say hello to... Oh, my name is Rob Roberts.

8
00:00:41,853 --> 00:00:42,713
[SPEAKER_04]: You might know me as Sky.

9
00:00:42,733 --> 00:00:43,614
[SPEAKER_04]: I should introduce myself.

10
00:00:43,634 --> 00:00:46,556
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I'll introduce the co-hosts we have over there sitting next to me, Loki.

11
00:00:47,077 --> 00:00:47,957
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I'm here.

12
00:00:48,178 --> 00:00:51,740
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, and joining us on Skype line tonight, say hello to DarkSakura.

13
00:00:52,441 --> 00:00:52,741
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi.

14
00:00:53,061 --> 00:00:53,722
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you doing?

15
00:00:54,742 --> 00:00:55,123
[SPEAKER_00]: Sick.

16
00:00:55,803 --> 00:00:56,784
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, what happened?

17
00:00:57,124 --> 00:01:00,607
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you catch something from Adam Curry at the podcast awards, or what happened?

18
00:01:01,167 --> 00:01:03,749
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I was already sick when I was there, apparently.

19
00:01:03,909 --> 00:01:04,590
[SPEAKER_00]: Apparently.

20
00:01:05,103 --> 00:01:13,427
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a cold, turned into a sinus infection, LA made it worse, and now I have a pretty nasty case of bronchitis.

21
00:01:14,687 --> 00:01:17,388
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like God doesn't want you to be on this show or something.

22
00:01:17,428 --> 00:01:19,669
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what the hell's going on, DarkSakura.

23
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:20,490
[SPEAKER_00]: It happens.

24
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:30,634
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time this year, I tend to get some type of respiratory illness, but last year I didn't get it, and I think it was just because I lost all that weight the year before, and I

25
00:01:33,135 --> 00:01:35,696
[SPEAKER_00]: This year it's like, hi, you remember me?

26
00:01:35,716 --> 00:01:36,516
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm back.

27
00:01:36,757 --> 00:01:38,097
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's give you pneumonia now.

28
00:01:38,337 --> 00:01:40,118
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a healthy... They x-rayed me for pneumonia.

29
00:01:40,438 --> 00:01:41,819
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just a healthy LA air.

30
00:01:42,739 --> 00:01:44,660
[SPEAKER_00]: I swear it had to have been that.

31
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,881
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, real quick, how was the podcast awards?

32
00:01:47,801 --> 00:01:49,702
[SPEAKER_00]: It was... We weren't there for very long.

33
00:01:50,582 --> 00:01:51,603
[SPEAKER_00]: Julie went with me.

34
00:01:52,123 --> 00:01:55,104
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, you know, she helps us out sometimes.

35
00:01:55,184 --> 00:01:55,464
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.

36
00:01:56,865 --> 00:01:57,005
[SPEAKER_00]: And...

37
00:01:58,071 --> 00:02:04,674
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, let me real quick, let me say, there are a lot of folks behind the scenes that help us out with a lot of things that sometimes don't get their due credit, especially Jason.

38
00:02:04,975 --> 00:02:13,659
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, we'd be dead in the water without Jason, so thank you to Jason, and Julie, and Jess over at DDR Freak, and just everybody who helps us out behind the scenes and doesn't get their credit sometimes.

39
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:14,439
[SPEAKER_04]: So, anyway.

40
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,641
[SPEAKER_00]: Julie kept my road rage down to a minimum on the trip.

41
00:02:20,222 --> 00:02:21,563
[SPEAKER_00]: Which, there was plenty of that.

42
00:02:22,163 --> 00:02:22,283
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm.

43
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:24,391
[SPEAKER_04]: How was the awards themselves?

44
00:02:25,051 --> 00:02:29,515
[SPEAKER_00]: The ceremony itself, it was sort of like, let's give it everybody on stage, give them their thing, get off.

45
00:02:30,296 --> 00:02:32,557
[SPEAKER_00]: Only the people who win the big prizes get to talk.

46
00:02:33,558 --> 00:02:38,882
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got to see Adam Curry, who looks a lot more handsome now than he did in his MTV days.

47
00:02:41,144 --> 00:02:41,465
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

48
00:02:42,445 --> 00:02:43,446
[SPEAKER_00]: Met some cool people.

49
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:46,729
[SPEAKER_00]: I met Frank from The Overnightscape.

50
00:02:49,031 --> 00:02:51,292
[SPEAKER_00]: Haven't had a chance yet to check out his podcast.

51
00:02:51,312 --> 00:02:53,094
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, I came back to homework

52
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:58,802
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I came back to homework and then getting sick again.

53
00:03:00,162 --> 00:03:01,643
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to the doctor soon after I got back.

54
00:03:02,063 --> 00:03:04,685
[SPEAKER_04]: So, leading into our next topic, how was your gaming week?

55
00:03:04,745 --> 00:03:06,506
[SPEAKER_04]: I imagine you probably haven't gotten a lot of gaming done.

56
00:03:07,586 --> 00:03:17,612
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I can say that the last weekend was pretty much taken up by Phantasy Star Online for the Xbox.

57
00:03:18,552 --> 00:03:20,053
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a lot of that going around.

58
00:03:20,113 --> 00:03:21,234
[SPEAKER_04]: Are there still a lot of people on there?

59
00:03:22,056 --> 00:03:23,937
[SPEAKER_00]: Apparently so, yeah.

60
00:03:24,518 --> 00:03:35,046
[SPEAKER_00]: But the guy that we stayed with, he was busy playing that, and then Julie was showing him Blueburst, so we had some Blueburst going on.

61
00:03:35,486 --> 00:03:35,606
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.

62
00:03:35,626 --> 00:03:40,209
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was kind of glad I didn't uninstall it off my laptop, because they used that version.

63
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:50,177
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, the theme for my house has been Need for Speed Underground Most Wanted, which...

64
00:03:51,055 --> 00:03:51,896
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks kind of pretty.

65
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:55,978
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm reserving my judgment for the Xbox 360 version when it's out.

66
00:03:56,839 --> 00:04:08,666
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, right now, it just looks kind of... It's got lots of prettiness going on and lots of destructiveness going on, but I've kind of had my fill of watching that game.

67
00:04:09,226 --> 00:04:18,472
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately, the 360 version is only a port, so it's only a little bit better, and I hear that they've got some really bad loading, like, choppiness in it, so...

68
00:04:19,321 --> 00:04:22,183
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, I'm going to reserve my judgment for actually seeing it.

69
00:04:22,544 --> 00:04:22,984
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

70
00:04:23,605 --> 00:04:26,487
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, so is that all you pretty much have for your gaming week?

71
00:04:27,848 --> 00:04:29,589
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's pretty much it.

72
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:34,213
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had this copy of Mario Kart DS sitting on my computer desk now for a week.

73
00:04:34,674 --> 00:04:36,295
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got to open that thing soon.

74
00:04:36,915 --> 00:04:37,396
[SPEAKER_00]: It's awesome.

75
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:38,257
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, no, it's open.

76
00:04:38,317 --> 00:04:39,017
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sitting there.

77
00:04:39,037 --> 00:04:42,480
[SPEAKER_00]: It just hasn't been in my DS yet.

78
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:44,341
[SPEAKER_04]: Get some use out of that this Thanksgiving.

79
00:04:44,382 --> 00:04:44,802
[SPEAKER_04]: It's great.

80
00:04:45,723 --> 00:04:46,143
Alright.

81
00:04:47,066 --> 00:04:48,127
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

82
00:04:49,087 --> 00:04:53,290
[SPEAKER_05]: My week was filled with Shadow Colossus, which is fun.

83
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:54,030
[SPEAKER_05]: Haven't really got any.

84
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:54,951
[SPEAKER_04]: Haven't you beaten that yet?

85
00:04:55,531 --> 00:04:56,732
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I haven't really been playing it.

86
00:04:58,873 --> 00:05:00,134
[SPEAKER_05]: Mainly Mario Kart DS.

87
00:05:00,374 --> 00:05:03,116
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been pounding out trying to get Rob unlocked.

88
00:05:03,356 --> 00:05:05,237
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to beat the entire game for that.

89
00:05:05,417 --> 00:05:06,918
[SPEAKER_05]: Not me, Rob, but Rob the Robot.

90
00:05:06,938 --> 00:05:08,399
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob the Robot, yeah.

91
00:05:08,939 --> 00:05:11,381
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's pretty cool, and the online stuff's pretty fun.

92
00:05:11,401 --> 00:05:13,342
[SPEAKER_05]: It does take a little time to get

93
00:05:13,462 --> 00:05:13,682
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura,

94
00:05:31,957 --> 00:05:32,918
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

95
00:05:58,314 --> 00:06:00,035
[SPEAKER_05]: You're still convinced you're getting it Tuesday, huh?

96
00:06:00,215 --> 00:06:05,258
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure if I'm getting it Tuesday, but I know I'm not getting it after Christmas, like they say.

97
00:06:05,318 --> 00:06:09,080
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't believe that they're going to be that long.

98
00:06:09,501 --> 00:06:14,624
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the big deal if you hype this system up as the big thing for Christmas and you don't ship anymore?

99
00:06:14,664 --> 00:06:15,544
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of retarded.

100
00:06:15,904 --> 00:06:16,765
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree.

101
00:06:16,785 --> 00:06:18,166
[SPEAKER_04]: We're getting one.

102
00:06:18,766 --> 00:06:18,966
[SPEAKER_04]: Huh?

103
00:06:19,667 --> 00:06:20,207
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting one.

104
00:06:21,135 --> 00:06:28,161
[SPEAKER_04]: See, you have that lucky thing of being very close with a GameStop employee that can manage to get you one, right?

105
00:06:28,942 --> 00:06:31,464
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah.

106
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:33,866
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I had something else about my gaming week.

107
00:06:34,026 --> 00:06:35,648
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, what's that?

108
00:06:36,669 --> 00:06:43,154
[SPEAKER_00]: My extreme amounts of giddiness after finding out that Kingdom Hearts 2 is having a Tron thing.

109
00:06:44,015 --> 00:06:44,655
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I know.

110
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:46,397
[SPEAKER_04]: We talked about that briefly on last week's show.

111
00:06:46,417 --> 00:06:47,117
[SPEAKER_05]: That's amazing.

112
00:06:47,137 --> 00:06:47,858
[SPEAKER_05]: It makes me all kinds of happy.

113
00:06:48,851 --> 00:06:55,036
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, the new trailers show Steamboat Willie is going to be another level that's in that, as well as Lilo and Stitch.

114
00:06:55,797 --> 00:06:56,577
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, I saw that.

115
00:06:56,637 --> 00:06:59,840
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I knew that because they had it at the E3 demo.

116
00:07:02,222 --> 00:07:03,243
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got Stitch there.

117
00:07:03,823 --> 00:07:08,287
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also played a good bit of it at E3, too, because I have all my pictures up.

118
00:07:08,347 --> 00:07:09,448
[SPEAKER_05]: The game just looks sexy.

119
00:07:09,508 --> 00:07:10,209
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all it is.

120
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:15,233
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's out on Japanese sites.

121
00:07:15,313 --> 00:07:15,814
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the...

122
00:07:16,815 --> 00:07:43,498
[SPEAKER_04]: the demo reel for Final Fantasy 12 which is looking pretty hot some folks here have that now because Dragon Quest 8 I haven't gotten to check it out myself yet but I've heard it's pretty darn good too bad the game might be getting delayed again you know that's a rumor going around right now that the game's getting delayed again not surprising they said for sure March 2006 in Japan but now they're saying maybe not we'll see well

123
00:07:43,993 --> 00:07:51,747
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing about the Final Fantasy games I've noticed though is that the US versions are almost always worth waiting for because they add more stuff.

124
00:07:52,589 --> 00:07:53,130
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, a little bit.

125
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:56,556
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it gets re-released as an international version and blah blah blah blah.

126
00:07:57,287 --> 00:08:05,792
[SPEAKER_05]: What I'm kind of waiting for, you know, and this is really, every time I see Kingdom Hearts 2, I keep thinking, you know, back to Super Mario RPG.

127
00:08:06,472 --> 00:08:11,155
[SPEAKER_05]: That was one of the coolest things where you have Square teaming up with Nintendo to make a really kick-ass RPG.

128
00:08:11,215 --> 00:08:18,399
[SPEAKER_05]: They really need to do that again, just with all their franchises, kind of make a new RPG and make it really cool.

129
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:21,321
[SPEAKER_05]: Paper Mario is no excuse for an RPG.

130
00:08:21,381 --> 00:08:23,702
[SPEAKER_05]: This is not a sequel to the Super Mario RPG.

131
00:08:23,802 --> 00:08:25,243
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a poor excuse, is what it is.

132
00:08:26,665 --> 00:08:27,986
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, that's what I'm waiting for.

133
00:08:28,527 --> 00:08:29,467
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll keep waiting, I'm sure.

134
00:08:30,268 --> 00:08:32,069
[SPEAKER_00]: We need Smash Bros.

135
00:08:32,109 --> 00:08:33,169
[SPEAKER_00]: Final Fantasy Edition.

136
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:37,131
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys have some crazy combinations.

137
00:08:37,152 --> 00:08:38,032
[SPEAKER_04]: We already got Urgot.

138
00:08:38,692 --> 00:08:39,213
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's true.

139
00:08:40,313 --> 00:08:42,775
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no, that's just Final Fantasy VII.

140
00:08:43,655 --> 00:08:46,417
[SPEAKER_00]: We need full-on Smash Bros.

141
00:08:46,437 --> 00:08:49,779
[SPEAKER_00]: style with different lock and line.

142
00:08:50,319 --> 00:08:50,699
[SPEAKER_04]: Rydia.

143
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:51,860
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

144
00:08:52,691 --> 00:08:53,112
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.

145
00:08:53,372 --> 00:08:54,673
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, My Gaming Week.

146
00:08:55,634 --> 00:08:58,317
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see, I also have been playing an awful lot of Mario Kart DS.

147
00:08:58,377 --> 00:08:59,458
[SPEAKER_04]: It really is that good.

148
00:08:59,578 --> 00:09:02,301
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't been into a Mario Kart game probably since maybe the 64.

149
00:09:03,462 --> 00:09:07,286
[SPEAKER_04]: Really so much though, the Super Nintendo one is really where the old schoolness is at.

150
00:09:07,586 --> 00:09:08,026
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.

151
00:09:08,847 --> 00:09:10,649
[SPEAKER_04]: And I love this new one for the DS.

152
00:09:10,789 --> 00:09:13,492
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, for some reason the GameCube one, the formula was just off.

153
00:09:13,532 --> 00:09:14,593
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't care for the GameCube one.

154
00:09:15,153 --> 00:09:15,334
[SPEAKER_04]: And the

155
00:09:16,448 --> 00:09:19,409
[SPEAKER_04]: Game Boy One that they had previous, it wasn't the same.

156
00:09:19,769 --> 00:09:20,289
[SPEAKER_04]: It really wasn't.

157
00:09:20,329 --> 00:09:21,829
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what to say, but it wasn't the same.

158
00:09:22,189 --> 00:09:23,130
[SPEAKER_04]: But this one is great.

159
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:26,931
[SPEAKER_04]: It controls pretty good considering it's got the D-pad and everything.

160
00:09:28,031 --> 00:09:29,611
[SPEAKER_04]: And the game runs great.

161
00:09:29,651 --> 00:09:30,852
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a very simple engine.

162
00:09:31,552 --> 00:09:34,733
[SPEAKER_04]: It plays much like it was the old Super Nintendo One, and I love that.

163
00:09:34,753 --> 00:09:36,713
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the fact that they included the retro tracks.

164
00:09:37,213 --> 00:09:38,533
[SPEAKER_04]: The wireless features are great.

165
00:09:38,573 --> 00:09:40,134
[SPEAKER_04]: And the fact that it goes online...

166
00:09:40,734 --> 00:09:41,915
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

167
00:09:59,506 --> 00:10:06,289
[SPEAKER_04]: We're hearing, at least we kind of got word this week, that Nintendo is banning you from sharing your friend code on their forums.

168
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:09,210
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not allowed on Nintendo's forums to actually share your own friend code.

169
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:15,913
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think the reason why they're trying to do that is they're wanting to make sure that people on your friends list are actually your friends.

170
00:10:16,013 --> 00:10:19,815
[SPEAKER_04]: And not that they could stop me from posting on another forum, but I think that's very interesting.

171
00:10:19,975 --> 00:10:22,836
[SPEAKER_04]: They are really, really being careful with this online stuff.

172
00:10:22,856 --> 00:10:26,457
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, they don't want to have that story in the news about, you know...

173
00:10:28,158 --> 00:10:32,621
[SPEAKER_04]: Little Girl meets Old Pervert on Nintendo Game and on Animal Crossing.

174
00:10:32,641 --> 00:10:36,683
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I was going to say, well, in Mario Kart, they can't really communicate anyway, so it's like retarded.

175
00:10:36,703 --> 00:10:42,127
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I thought was weird, because you can't really communicate in Mario Kart anyway, which is kind of one of its downfalls, is that you can't do anything.

176
00:10:42,167 --> 00:10:45,349
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't use the microphone to chat, you can't write, talk, or anything.

177
00:10:45,389 --> 00:10:47,090
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, that would be so bad.

178
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:47,670
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but...

179
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:48,711
[SPEAKER_04]: and so on.

180
00:11:09,551 --> 00:11:10,231
[SPEAKER_04]: Animal Crossing.

181
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:13,293
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we'll see that front end for the Wi-Fi be a little better.

182
00:11:13,553 --> 00:11:16,875
[SPEAKER_05]: My peeve with that game is the whole battle mode.

183
00:11:17,075 --> 00:11:17,575
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't get it.

184
00:11:18,075 --> 00:11:18,916
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't get it at all.

185
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:22,137
[SPEAKER_05]: And I love the battle mode in the Super Nintendo game.

186
00:11:22,197 --> 00:11:25,519
[SPEAKER_05]: I love the battle mode in the Nintendo 64 game.

187
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,981
[SPEAKER_05]: I just... I didn't get it with GameCube.

188
00:11:29,561 --> 00:11:32,723
[SPEAKER_05]: Their battle mode was crap because their arenas were crap.

189
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:36,384
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't even think the Game Boy Advance version had battle mode.

190
00:11:36,885 --> 00:11:37,045
[SPEAKER_05]: But...

191
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:41,937
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just, this one's pretty cool, I just don't get how they blow up the other balloons.

192
00:11:42,258 --> 00:11:47,840
[SPEAKER_04]: My other minor minor bitch besides that would be maybe some of the other mechanics in the actual racing.

193
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:55,243
[SPEAKER_04]: It does seem like it favors, and I know that Mario Kart is supposed to do this, where like if you're in last place you get the really good items, and when you're in first place you get the not so great items.

194
00:11:55,663 --> 00:11:57,484
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems to really favor...

195
00:11:58,084 --> 00:11:59,025
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, last place.

196
00:11:59,065 --> 00:11:59,726
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, over first place.

197
00:11:59,746 --> 00:12:00,626
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, almost too much.

198
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:01,627
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, it's kind of skewed.

199
00:12:02,028 --> 00:12:04,009
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, though, that's a real minor, minor complaint.

200
00:12:04,189 --> 00:12:06,631
[SPEAKER_04]: I still highly, highly recommend Mario Kart DS.

201
00:12:06,672 --> 00:12:07,552
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's a great title.

202
00:12:08,093 --> 00:12:10,495
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially if you've loved any of the other Mario Kart titles.

203
00:12:10,795 --> 00:12:12,076
[SPEAKER_04]: So I give it my highest recommendation.

204
00:12:13,277 --> 00:12:14,799
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, what I got to play this week.

205
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:16,260
[SPEAKER_04]: Dance Dance Revolution Ultramix 3.

206
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,342
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, Orange Lines Radio started all about music video games.

207
00:12:19,362 --> 00:12:21,524
[SPEAKER_04]: So, of course, I have to check out all the new ones when they come out.

208
00:12:21,925 --> 00:12:23,146
[SPEAKER_04]: DDR Ultramix 3.

209
00:12:24,087 --> 00:12:24,427
[SPEAKER_04]: My only...

210
00:12:25,189 --> 00:12:25,850
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a good game.

211
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:26,811
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a solid game.

212
00:12:26,931 --> 00:12:28,993
[SPEAKER_04]: I do recommend it for fans of DDR.

213
00:12:29,073 --> 00:12:35,338
[SPEAKER_04]: For people that are just getting into it, I can only give it about a borderline recommendation because I think DDR Ultramix 2 was better.

214
00:12:35,699 --> 00:12:38,021
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the formula for how they were picking the songs was better.

215
00:12:38,601 --> 00:12:41,183
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's kind of one of those things where it's like, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.

216
00:12:41,684 --> 00:12:44,927
[SPEAKER_04]: And Konami kind of really went crazy with some of their song picks.

217
00:12:44,947 --> 00:12:46,168
[SPEAKER_04]: They have some like

218
00:12:46,943 --> 00:12:50,185
[SPEAKER_04]: Stuff that sounds like... I don't even know.

219
00:12:50,505 --> 00:12:55,407
[SPEAKER_04]: They're trying to do homages to these bands, but does that mean that they're good stuff to dance to?

220
00:12:55,928 --> 00:12:56,348
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

221
00:12:56,548 --> 00:13:00,750
[SPEAKER_04]: See, I think they made some really odd picks, like Ray Charles and The Clash and stuff.

222
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:04,732
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, although those are great songs, I don't think they make for good DDR songs.

223
00:13:05,053 --> 00:13:07,914
[SPEAKER_04]: So that kind of ruins the game for me in that aspect.

224
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:15,318
[SPEAKER_04]: And plus, just the fact that the song packs that you bought on Ultramix 2 do not function correctly, not all the songs work right...

225
00:13:15,798 --> 00:13:16,258
[SPEAKER_04]: Ultramix 3

226
00:13:45,552 --> 00:13:47,973
[SPEAKER_04]: But first, let's get to some gaming news.

227
00:13:48,553 --> 00:13:50,714
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll go ahead and let DarkSakura start off.

228
00:13:50,735 --> 00:13:53,916
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, we love Katamari.

229
00:13:54,396 --> 00:13:57,398
[SPEAKER_04]: And I understand you got some news about the next creation of Katamari.

230
00:13:58,558 --> 00:14:01,059
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, it's called Me and My Katamari.

231
00:14:01,179 --> 00:14:02,360
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a cute name.

232
00:14:03,781 --> 00:14:04,041
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

233
00:14:05,982 --> 00:14:12,025
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at the pictures that are online right now, the game looks actually very fabulous.

234
00:14:12,065 --> 00:14:14,726
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it looks top-notch for the PSP.

235
00:14:15,678 --> 00:14:22,944
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the control, from what I understand, though, is supposed to be pretty much crappy.

236
00:14:24,145 --> 00:14:27,947
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can understand that without having both analog on it.

237
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:39,176
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, imagine you're going from a game where basically you've got two-handed control to trying to control it with one hand.

238
00:14:39,236 --> 00:14:40,417
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to work.

239
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:44,100
[SPEAKER_04]: So are they going to do it with the one analog and the buttons, or what are they going to do?

240
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:46,583
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen too much into it.

241
00:14:46,683 --> 00:14:50,604
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there are some good features that I think might make up for that.

242
00:14:51,605 --> 00:14:52,725
[SPEAKER_04]: Like what?

243
00:14:52,885 --> 00:14:54,566
[SPEAKER_00]: Wireless play for up to four people.

244
00:14:55,566 --> 00:14:55,986
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.

245
00:14:57,006 --> 00:14:59,447
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got the prince and the cousins.

246
00:14:59,547 --> 00:15:00,527
[SPEAKER_00]: There's old and new.

247
00:15:01,728 --> 00:15:09,550
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got customization options, more masks, more headgear, the ability to wear them various places.

248
00:15:11,396 --> 00:15:18,298
[SPEAKER_00]: A new island interface that highlights players, your options and different stages represented by animals, needs, and new homes.

249
00:15:20,218 --> 00:15:28,520
[SPEAKER_00]: There's actually, the information for it is up at katamari.namco.com Okay.

250
00:15:29,701 --> 00:15:39,883
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's also photos up on this, actually quite a number of photos at worthplaying.com

251
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:47,978
[SPEAKER_00]: Which actually was, this particular link was also emailed to us by one of our listeners.

252
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:49,640
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

253
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:53,004
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, thank you, listener, for sharing the alias developments on me and my Kamari.

254
00:15:54,045 --> 00:16:09,019
[SPEAKER_04]: Me and my Katamari, now we know what they're officially going to call it here in the U.S., because previously we just knew My My Katamari was like the Japanese translation, so it's kind of nice to hear that it's going to have a name here in the U.S.

255
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:11,621
[SPEAKER_04]: that actually makes a little more sense, so that's nice to hear.

256
00:16:12,282 --> 00:16:12,562
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

257
00:16:13,281 --> 00:16:15,943
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, moving on, I got another story for you guys.

258
00:16:16,503 --> 00:16:20,605
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and this has to do with, um, World of Warcraft.

259
00:16:21,026 --> 00:16:23,807
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, as you know, um, it's released into other countries now.

260
00:16:23,847 --> 00:16:26,849
[SPEAKER_04]: It just recently went over into, uh, Asia, other parts of there.

261
00:16:27,389 --> 00:16:30,491
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, what's interesting, the game rolled out in China not that long ago.

262
00:16:31,071 --> 00:16:34,412
[SPEAKER_04]: And unfortunately, they've had a bit of an incident there.

263
00:16:34,792 --> 00:16:42,715
[SPEAKER_04]: A 13-year-old Chinese boy actually jumped to their death from a 24-story building from playing too much World of Warcraft.

264
00:16:42,755 --> 00:16:44,656
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, that's not the new thing, okay?

265
00:16:44,696 --> 00:16:46,196
[SPEAKER_04]: That happened after it rolled out last year.

266
00:16:46,256 --> 00:16:47,497
[SPEAKER_04]: That actually happened last year.

267
00:16:47,837 --> 00:16:48,797
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the new part.

268
00:16:49,097 --> 00:16:58,641
[SPEAKER_04]: The parents of the boy are now suing Blizzard, saying they actually got a lawyer and, quote, internet game addiction researcher.

269
00:16:59,574 --> 00:17:03,915
[SPEAKER_04]: and they are filing the suits upon the whole game industry on behalf of parents.

270
00:17:05,256 --> 00:17:05,756
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

271
00:17:05,836 --> 00:17:10,138
[SPEAKER_04]: The question is, how liable should game companies be when their kids OD on the gaming?

272
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:13,299
[SPEAKER_04]: Does World of Warcraft feature jumping out of buildings?

273
00:17:14,219 --> 00:17:14,359
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

274
00:17:14,379 --> 00:17:16,240
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if that's what they're saying so much.

275
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:19,060
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is how it forced some kid to jump out of a building?

276
00:17:19,281 --> 00:17:20,741
[SPEAKER_05]: Because he was addicted to a game?

277
00:17:21,981 --> 00:17:23,802
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I don't see how that works.

278
00:17:24,222 --> 00:17:26,483
[SPEAKER_05]: If I'm addicted to alcohol, I don't jump out of a window.

279
00:17:28,408 --> 00:17:29,388
[SPEAKER_05]: I go drink more alcohol.

280
00:17:29,769 --> 00:17:30,069
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

281
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:31,951
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't get it.

282
00:17:33,572 --> 00:17:33,832
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

283
00:17:35,174 --> 00:17:39,738
[SPEAKER_04]: So, just kind of, I don't know, it's too bad.

284
00:17:40,338 --> 00:17:46,944
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's interesting to hear that the lawsuit crazy stuff doesn't just happen in the US, because that story is coming out of China.

285
00:17:47,325 --> 00:17:48,546
[SPEAKER_04]: So, go figure.

286
00:17:48,962 --> 00:17:49,923
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, you got something for us?

287
00:17:51,123 --> 00:17:53,025
[SPEAKER_05]: Those crazy Chinese and their games.

288
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:54,946
[SPEAKER_05]: They're always killing somebody.

289
00:17:54,966 --> 00:17:56,246
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you have something related to that?

290
00:17:56,487 --> 00:17:57,107
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I don't.

291
00:17:58,988 --> 00:18:00,009
[SPEAKER_05]: I sort of, I guess.

292
00:18:01,089 --> 00:18:10,915
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, this year's Spike Awards, or their video game awards, the results have been posted because we like to spoil everybody's...

293
00:18:12,298 --> 00:18:14,279
[SPEAKER_04]: Game of the Year, Resident Evil 4 Best Action Game, God of War

294
00:18:25,006 --> 00:18:25,767
[SPEAKER_05]: No surprise there.

295
00:18:26,527 --> 00:18:30,009
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, best sports title, of course, Tony Hawk's American Wasteland.

296
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:33,231
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and then they have some really strange stuff.

297
00:18:33,411 --> 00:18:35,113
[SPEAKER_05]: Best cyber vixen of the year.

298
00:18:35,933 --> 00:18:39,315
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, some chick from 007 from Russia with Love.

299
00:18:39,856 --> 00:18:46,400
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, one that I thought was pretty cool, um, was best, um, soundtrack.

300
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:51,783
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they have Guitar Hero as best soundtrack, but best original score, We Love Katamari, which is really cool.

301
00:18:52,744 --> 00:18:52,824
[SPEAKER_05]: Um,

302
00:18:54,637 --> 00:19:01,100
[SPEAKER_05]: What's kind of interesting is they have a whole bunch of games winning awards that aren't even out yet.

303
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,081
[SPEAKER_05]: Like Peter Jackson's King Kong, the official game of the movie.

304
00:19:05,501 --> 00:19:06,262
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not out yet.

305
00:19:06,442 --> 00:19:07,002
[SPEAKER_05]: What did it win?

306
00:19:07,662 --> 00:19:16,005
[SPEAKER_05]: It won, let's see here, Best Performance by a Human Male, Debbie Jack Black in Peter Jackson's King Kong.

307
00:19:17,006 --> 00:19:20,887
[SPEAKER_05]: It also won, let's see here, Best Cast.

308
00:19:21,533 --> 00:19:22,394
[SPEAKER_05]: Best handheld game, Luminous

309
00:19:41,769 --> 00:19:42,730
[SPEAKER_04]: which I thought was pretty cool.

310
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:43,390
[SPEAKER_04]: Well deserved.

311
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:49,314
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, Resident Evil 4 being the game of the year there, I think I could see that.

312
00:19:49,354 --> 00:20:01,102
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it may not be my favorite game this year, but damn, it was a real sharp looking game, really innovated and just the graphics were amazing and I could see Resident Evil 4 walking away with that.

313
00:20:01,863 --> 00:20:07,687
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes more sense to me than some of the other awards that I see shows give for game of the year sometimes, so...

314
00:20:08,613 --> 00:20:09,373
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm okay with that.

315
00:20:09,754 --> 00:20:10,774
[SPEAKER_04]: What were some of the other nominees?

316
00:20:10,814 --> 00:20:11,594
[SPEAKER_04]: Did they list the nominees?

317
00:20:11,614 --> 00:20:13,195
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I forget.

318
00:20:13,495 --> 00:20:14,755
[SPEAKER_04]: Who were the other nominees for Game of the Year?

319
00:20:15,096 --> 00:20:21,038
[SPEAKER_05]: We also have some other Best Supporting Male Performance, Christopher Walken in True Crime, New York City.

320
00:20:21,118 --> 00:20:28,381
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, also Best Supporting Female Performance, also won by Tracy Lourdes in True Crime, New York City.

321
00:20:28,581 --> 00:20:29,061
[SPEAKER_04]: Go figure.

322
00:20:29,221 --> 00:20:30,762
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, what were the other nominees for Game of the Year?

323
00:20:31,102 --> 00:20:35,544
[SPEAKER_05]: Game of the Year, the other nominees, we had God of War, definitely deserving.

324
00:20:36,857 --> 00:20:39,539
[SPEAKER_05]: Call of Duty 2, also a very deserving game.

325
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:41,760
[SPEAKER_05]: World of Warcraft, also very deserving.

326
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:42,460
[SPEAKER_05]: And Fear.

327
00:20:44,361 --> 00:20:45,162
[SPEAKER_05]: All very good games.

328
00:20:45,262 --> 00:20:48,103
[SPEAKER_04]: See, I'm kind of surprised World of Warcraft didn't walk away with it, honestly.

329
00:20:48,124 --> 00:20:50,665
[SPEAKER_04]: Just with all the people that are just sickly obsessed with that game.

330
00:20:50,705 --> 00:20:56,208
[SPEAKER_04]: But Resident Evil 4, I'm not going to say that I necessarily think World of Warcraft is a better game, but Resident Evil 4, I can see that.

331
00:20:56,428 --> 00:20:57,529
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a pretty solid list.

332
00:20:57,569 --> 00:20:58,029
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll give it to them.

333
00:20:58,049 --> 00:20:58,630
[SPEAKER_04]: They've got a good list.

334
00:20:58,890 --> 00:20:59,670
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, let me put it this way.

335
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:01,451
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a lot better than, say, GeForce.

336
00:21:01,891 --> 00:21:05,033
[SPEAKER_00]: I disagree with Resident Evil 4.

337
00:21:05,293 --> 00:21:05,554
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

338
00:21:05,594 --> 00:21:06,214
[SPEAKER_04]: What would you have put?

339
00:21:07,654 --> 00:21:10,896
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly would have gone with World of Warcraft or God of War.

340
00:21:11,276 --> 00:21:13,318
[SPEAKER_04]: Why were you not so big on Resident Evil 4?

341
00:21:14,379 --> 00:21:25,446
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you've followed the series, it's actually such a departure from the rest of the series that, I don't know, as a game it was great, but it wasn't Resident Evil.

342
00:21:26,306 --> 00:21:28,568
[SPEAKER_04]: But if they'd called it something else, would you have been okay with it?

343
00:21:29,408 --> 00:21:30,089
[SPEAKER_00]: Possibly.

344
00:21:30,109 --> 00:21:34,252
[SPEAKER_00]: It would have been like, hi, we're pretending to be a zombie game without zombies, then yeah.

345
00:21:34,272 --> 00:21:34,792
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

346
00:21:35,905 --> 00:21:36,245
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

347
00:21:36,765 --> 00:21:41,107
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you heard me talking earlier in the show about DDR Ultramix 3, which was released last week.

348
00:21:41,427 --> 00:21:50,651
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the biggest gambles that Konami took was in shaking up the song list with a variety and eclectic mix of music, everything from rap to rock to synth to classic Spanish music.

349
00:21:51,012 --> 00:21:55,153
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't neglect some of the things that worked for them in last year's DDR Ultramix 2, however.

350
00:21:55,574 --> 00:22:01,976
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the songs in DDR Ultramix 2 that got a great reception from the fans was In My Eyes, as remixed by Midihead.

351
00:22:02,337 --> 00:22:04,998
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Midihead is back in this year's DDR Ultramix 3,

352
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:06,959
[SPEAKER_04]: I am sorry, I'm so sorry, it was a...

353
00:22:22,509 --> 00:22:31,556
[SPEAKER_04]: Downing some Pepsi One at the moment Suddenly I thought I was reintroducing DarkSakura Because that's usually how she introduces herself Oh no, you mean this has already been done?

354
00:22:31,596 --> 00:22:49,889
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you two are going to have to have a contest someday I don't know what's up with that Oh jeez Alright, well, first thing I want to know about You know, your song in Ultramix 2 was so well received by the fans How long did it take Konami to say Hey, we've got to bring him back for Ultramix 3 It took him a couple of months to see the light, man

355
00:22:50,629 --> 00:22:52,210
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a couple of months.

356
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:59,454
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think that's one of the reasons why you got brought back is because the fans, do you think they noticed that, that the fans had such a great feedback to the last time?

357
00:23:00,595 --> 00:23:01,496
[SPEAKER_02]: It was all the fans.

358
00:23:01,816 --> 00:23:06,519
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think they would have called me back if the fans hadn't demanded the MIDI head.

359
00:23:07,459 --> 00:23:07,980
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, awesome.

360
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,160
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, congratulations.

361
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,582
[SPEAKER_04]: That's great to go from one song to three songs that you contributed to.

362
00:23:12,622 --> 00:23:13,483
[SPEAKER_04]: That's great.

363
00:23:13,743 --> 00:23:16,845
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, now next time, now this is a total secret, of course.

364
00:23:16,965 --> 00:23:17,245
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

365
00:23:17,305 --> 00:23:19,707
[SPEAKER_02]: Next time, this is for your listeners only.

366
00:23:19,827 --> 00:23:20,107
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

367
00:23:21,321 --> 00:23:27,145
[SPEAKER_02]: For the next game, it's going to be MidiHeads Dance Dance Revolution Ultra Mix 4.

368
00:23:28,186 --> 00:23:28,486
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

369
00:23:28,546 --> 00:23:30,888
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be Dance Dance Revolution MidiHeads Mix.

370
00:23:30,968 --> 00:23:34,411
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

371
00:23:34,811 --> 00:23:38,674
[SPEAKER_04]: I would rather dance to a mix made up completely of MidiHeads songs.

372
00:23:38,754 --> 00:23:43,097
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll tell you what, some of the songs they picked for this last mix, because they picked some really weird stuff.

373
00:23:43,117 --> 00:23:43,498
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop it.

374
00:23:43,638 --> 00:23:44,999
[SPEAKER_02]: You're making me blush.

375
00:23:47,305 --> 00:23:54,909
[SPEAKER_04]: This time, one of your original songs, because most people know you for your remixes, but now one of your original tracks, Raise Your Hands, actually shows up in the game.

376
00:23:55,230 --> 00:24:00,253
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you get to suggest this, or did Konami actually listen to your album and pick something, or how did that happen?

377
00:24:01,093 --> 00:24:07,077
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, actually, I just sent them a CD full of stuff after I did the In My Eyes remix.

378
00:24:08,037 --> 00:24:10,779
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, you know, guys, I also have

379
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:12,161
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of my own music.

380
00:24:12,541 --> 00:24:18,626
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they were surprised to get it and listen to it and actually hear that I have some talent in me.

381
00:24:18,706 --> 00:24:25,332
[SPEAKER_02]: And they decided that that was the song that was going in the next game.

382
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,120
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, awesome.

383
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,561
[SPEAKER_04]: It works really well for the game.

384
00:24:27,601 --> 00:24:32,984
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you've had a chance to see it in the game yet, but the cut and everything works really well, and the video's kind of cool, too.

385
00:24:33,185 --> 00:24:34,065
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it should, man.

386
00:24:34,105 --> 00:24:38,228
[SPEAKER_02]: I do crunches and sit-ups to that thing.

387
00:24:38,308 --> 00:24:39,909
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I don't think they put you in the video.

388
00:24:39,929 --> 00:24:41,690
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they hired some dancers to be in it.

389
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:45,812
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm a little too overweight for their taste.

390
00:24:45,852 --> 00:24:46,533
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all right.

391
00:24:47,993 --> 00:24:49,454
[SPEAKER_04]: So are most of the people playing the game.

392
00:24:49,494 --> 00:24:49,815
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on.

393
00:24:49,935 --> 00:24:50,395
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just kidding.

394
00:24:51,147 --> 00:24:51,968
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to get the game.

395
00:24:51,988 --> 00:24:52,990
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what's funny?

396
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:53,972
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what's funny.

397
00:24:55,454 --> 00:24:59,120
[SPEAKER_02]: I've done all this work for Konami, and I have yet to get the game.

398
00:25:00,062 --> 00:25:01,624
[SPEAKER_02]: They haven't hooked me up with the game.

399
00:25:01,744 --> 00:25:03,688
[SPEAKER_04]: They haven't sent you a copy of the game?

400
00:25:03,728 --> 00:25:05,490
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to make me go out and buy it.

401
00:25:06,407 --> 00:25:08,968
[SPEAKER_04]: I know people from Konami listen to this show.

402
00:25:09,028 --> 00:25:10,688
[SPEAKER_04]: Konami, send him the game.

403
00:25:10,868 --> 00:25:11,468
[SPEAKER_04]: He earned it.

404
00:25:11,789 --> 00:25:12,089
[SPEAKER_04]: People.

405
00:25:12,169 --> 00:25:15,850
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, I need an Xbox, too, then, at that time.

406
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:16,930
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they should send you all that stuff.

407
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:23,692
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, well, here's another thing I'm curious about is that, okay, your music did so well that you're in DR Ultramix 3 three times.

408
00:25:24,072 --> 00:25:30,534
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even know if you know about this yet, but did you know that one of your songs is crossing over into a game that Konami is putting out in Japan?

409
00:25:30,554 --> 00:25:31,634
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

410
00:25:32,945 --> 00:25:34,248
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my goodness!

411
00:25:34,669 --> 00:25:35,971
[SPEAKER_02]: You're kidding me!

412
00:25:36,091 --> 00:25:37,474
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I would hope... I knew, I knew, I knew.

413
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:38,616
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say, I hope you got paid for it.

414
00:25:38,636 --> 00:25:40,279
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys announced it on your website.

415
00:25:41,812 --> 00:25:42,292
[SPEAKER_04]: David Hasselhoff

416
00:26:08,528 --> 00:26:17,477
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to be the next David Hasselhoff of Japan.

417
00:26:18,618 --> 00:26:19,338
[SPEAKER_04]: How did that happen?

418
00:26:19,378 --> 00:26:21,861
[SPEAKER_04]: Did they tell you they were interested in doing this?

419
00:26:21,901 --> 00:26:22,742
[SPEAKER_04]: How did that all go down?

420
00:26:23,382 --> 00:26:24,864
[SPEAKER_02]: No, they don't tell me anything.

421
00:26:24,924 --> 00:26:25,384
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you kidding me?

422
00:26:25,404 --> 00:26:26,325
[SPEAKER_02]: They just do what they want.

423
00:26:26,906 --> 00:26:29,208
[SPEAKER_02]: They've paid me and done away with me.

424
00:26:33,868 --> 00:26:36,189
[SPEAKER_02]: They have full right to circulate that as they please.

425
00:26:36,449 --> 00:26:41,052
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, a lot of the fans were saying that you should be in Beatmania as well, and now that's happening.

426
00:26:41,092 --> 00:26:44,413
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, they're definitely listening to the fans over on some of the boards.

427
00:26:44,473 --> 00:26:50,436
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think that's one thing I've got to give to Konami Hawaii is the fact that they do listen to their fans.

428
00:26:50,957 --> 00:26:56,059
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is to be well-respected.

429
00:26:56,299 --> 00:26:59,101
[SPEAKER_02]: That doesn't happen a lot in this industry.

430
00:27:00,694 --> 00:27:01,295
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.

431
00:27:01,395 --> 00:27:08,519
[SPEAKER_04]: So kudos to Konami for actually reading and getting a pulse for what's going on on the message boards out there and giving us what we want, usually.

432
00:27:08,999 --> 00:27:09,300
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

433
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:15,743
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we're lucky enough to actually have a copy of Jelly Kiss Midi Head Smack Mix, so we're going to go ahead and play it for you guys right now.

434
00:27:17,084 --> 00:27:18,725
I'll keep my voice alive

435
00:28:35,167 --> 00:28:40,824
My boy, I just gotta let you know that I know that I'm not gonna die

436
00:29:02,438 --> 00:29:06,441
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, that was Midihead's smack mix of Jelly Kiss here on Orange Lounge Radio To Go.

437
00:29:06,701 --> 00:29:09,183
[SPEAKER_04]: We're joined still with the remixer himself, Midihead.

438
00:29:09,443 --> 00:29:14,846
[SPEAKER_04]: A little later in the program, we'll be bringing you one of his original tunes from DDR Ultramix 3, Raise Your Hands.

439
00:29:15,247 --> 00:29:23,772
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you want to check out more information on Midihead's music, check out his website, www.midihead.com.

440
00:29:24,613 --> 00:29:25,954
[SPEAKER_04]: Not meaty head.

441
00:29:25,994 --> 00:29:27,735
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, not meaty head or...

442
00:29:29,937 --> 00:29:44,948
[SPEAKER_04]: One other thing you've actually been doing on MidiHead.com, you actually, for the past couple months, you put out a couple podcasts of your own that were available on your website, and they were kind of teasing Dance Dance Revolution, Ultra Mix 3, and kind of playing, hey, here's some of my songs that are going to be in the game.

443
00:29:45,289 --> 00:29:50,092
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's some of the other artists that are going to be in the game, kind of teasing us with what was going to be in the game.

444
00:29:50,372 --> 00:29:52,534
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you going to continue to do this, even though the game's out?

445
00:29:52,554 --> 00:29:55,016
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you thinking that podcasting is something you want to keep doing?

446
00:29:56,354 --> 00:29:58,097
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, to be quite honest.

447
00:29:59,359 --> 00:30:02,203
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot of time, as you know, to put those things together.

448
00:30:04,766 --> 00:30:05,728
[SPEAKER_02]: If I continue to get...

449
00:30:06,229 --> 00:30:10,992
[SPEAKER_02]: The feedback that I've been getting from all the fans, then I don't really see any reason to discontinue it.

450
00:30:12,133 --> 00:30:14,295
[SPEAKER_02]: After all, we've got to give them what they want, right, Rob?

451
00:30:14,515 --> 00:30:15,175
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.

452
00:30:15,195 --> 00:30:16,396
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got to make those fans happy.

453
00:30:16,636 --> 00:30:17,036
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.

454
00:30:17,076 --> 00:30:21,920
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, one thing I think they'd want is to keep knowing what's going on in the world of Konami with all their games.

455
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:25,882
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think Konami would be good to you and let you be their voice?

456
00:30:26,983 --> 00:30:35,289
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, it's one of those concepts that certainly we're trying out right now.

457
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:56,172
[SPEAKER_02]: and I can't tell you how much dialogue I've had with Konami about it, but it's gone all the way up to corporate and we've discussed the benefits of having an artist kind of mingle a little bit more with the fans.

458
00:30:57,113 --> 00:31:01,015
[SPEAKER_02]: So in this form, it seems to be doing just fine.

459
00:31:01,055 --> 00:31:04,217
[SPEAKER_02]: I just need to find the time to do more podcasts.

460
00:31:04,822 --> 00:31:15,986
[SPEAKER_02]: I think if I continue doing them at the rate that I've been doing them, which is like every other month, it won't burn people out, and it won't burn me out.

461
00:31:16,046 --> 00:31:17,327
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we'll see what happens with that.

462
00:31:17,367 --> 00:31:20,028
[SPEAKER_04]: Good luck to you in whatever you decide to do with future podcasts.

463
00:31:20,468 --> 00:31:32,552
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, you know I've got to ask you this, because we're a video gaming-related show, and I know you said earlier in the program you haven't gotten a chance to play DDR Ultimate 3 yet, but I'm curious, are there any other video games that you're into?

464
00:31:32,612 --> 00:31:33,833
[SPEAKER_04]: What kind of video games do you like to play?

465
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:39,911
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I gotta say I have this really sick habit of firing up Urban Terror.

466
00:31:40,871 --> 00:31:42,571
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know I've mentioned that before.

467
00:31:43,452 --> 00:31:44,652
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a Quake 3 mod.

468
00:31:45,652 --> 00:31:49,013
[SPEAKER_02]: And I play it a little more than I really should.

469
00:31:49,633 --> 00:31:50,893
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you looking forward to Quake 4?

470
00:31:52,253 --> 00:31:52,774
[SPEAKER_02]: Quake 4?

471
00:31:52,814 --> 00:31:53,734
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

472
00:31:53,774 --> 00:32:04,376
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Rob, I have to say that although I used to play a lot more video games in my time, I don't find a lot of time to dive into...

473
00:32:05,296 --> 00:32:08,520
[SPEAKER_02]: as much first-person shooterism as I'd like to.

474
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:21,916
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's good, though, to remind our listeners that there is a real world out there outside of video games that sometimes involves work, working two or three jobs, kids and life and house and payments, and I think I've pretty much summed it up.

475
00:32:22,756 --> 00:32:24,277
[SPEAKER_04]: Enjoy youth while it lasts, kiddies.

476
00:32:24,537 --> 00:32:25,378
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, you bet.

477
00:32:25,438 --> 00:32:27,078
[SPEAKER_02]: You better enjoy youth while it lasts.

478
00:32:27,098 --> 00:32:28,699
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that one spawned off of the remix of In My Eyes.

479
00:32:50,569 --> 00:32:55,691
[SPEAKER_02]: Spawned off a phone call and there I am.

480
00:32:55,892 --> 00:33:01,054
[SPEAKER_04]: Should I just tell him this exciting story about how I was laying dying in my

481
00:33:14,494 --> 00:33:19,977
[SPEAKER_02]: Hospital bed after knee surgery and they cut a main artery and I was bleeding to death and overcame D.M.

482
00:33:20,017 --> 00:33:20,817
[SPEAKER_02]: Ashera.

483
00:33:20,977 --> 00:33:21,637
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it D.M.

484
00:33:21,677 --> 00:33:22,398
[SPEAKER_02]: Ashera?

485
00:33:23,738 --> 00:33:24,799
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

486
00:33:24,979 --> 00:33:29,021
[SPEAKER_04]: So he's the one that actually contacted you behind this game.

487
00:33:30,582 --> 00:33:34,704
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't know much about the game, so we're trying to figure out little bits and pieces wherever we can.

488
00:33:34,764 --> 00:33:41,387
[SPEAKER_04]: And if hospital bed, leg amputee, be it, then that's all we know so far.

489
00:33:43,457 --> 00:33:45,659
[SPEAKER_02]: I was getting out of control now.

490
00:33:46,739 --> 00:33:50,602
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well, back to a more serious story.

491
00:33:52,443 --> 00:33:58,227
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet probably a year and a half ago you probably didn't think that you would be so involved with video games as you are now.

492
00:33:58,428 --> 00:33:58,828
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

493
00:33:59,308 --> 00:33:59,789
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that true?

494
00:33:59,929 --> 00:34:03,211
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course I knew I was going to be involved in video games.

495
00:34:03,271 --> 00:34:03,831
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you kidding me?

496
00:34:03,851 --> 00:34:07,214
[SPEAKER_02]: I paint my entire destiny for them.

497
00:34:08,335 --> 00:34:10,376
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I actually...

498
00:34:12,605 --> 00:34:16,186
[SPEAKER_02]: Video games was something that I had planned on doing eventually.

499
00:34:16,406 --> 00:34:18,407
[SPEAKER_02]: I just didn't know when it was going to happen.

500
00:34:18,807 --> 00:34:27,209
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything I do in my musical avenues, I always try to leave as many doors open when I'm doing stuff.

501
00:34:27,449 --> 00:34:28,010
[SPEAKER_04]: And here I am.

502
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:30,870
[SPEAKER_04]: So do you have future plans to continue working with video games?

503
00:34:31,571 --> 00:34:33,091
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if the money's there, yeah.

504
00:34:33,151 --> 00:34:33,691
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you kidding me?

505
00:34:36,272 --> 00:34:37,852
[SPEAKER_04]: That sums it up, everybody.

506
00:34:37,872 --> 00:34:39,573
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll go where the money's at, won't we?

507
00:34:40,643 --> 00:34:42,583
[SPEAKER_02]: I gotta pay for my house, man.

508
00:34:42,603 --> 00:34:43,884
[SPEAKER_02]: I live in Southern California.

509
00:34:44,144 --> 00:34:44,684
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, ouch.

510
00:34:45,864 --> 00:34:49,765
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well, Middyhead, that's about all the time we have, but thanks so much for being on the show today.

511
00:34:49,825 --> 00:34:50,585
[SPEAKER_04]: We appreciate it.

512
00:34:50,745 --> 00:35:01,207
[SPEAKER_04]: Once again, guys, check it out, www.mittyhead.com if you're interested in Middyhead and he's got his own music there that you can download and the forums and his podcast.

513
00:35:01,227 --> 00:35:04,288
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just an action-packed site, so check it out, everybody.

514
00:35:04,328 --> 00:35:05,788
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks so much, Middyhead, for being on the show.

515
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:08,049
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you're welcome, dude.

516
00:35:08,349 --> 00:35:08,889
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

517
00:35:09,269 --> 00:35:10,149
[SPEAKER_00]: Yay, Middyhead!

518
00:35:10,615 --> 00:35:12,037
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's move on to another story.

519
00:35:12,898 --> 00:35:13,859
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to talk about this.

520
00:35:13,899 --> 00:35:18,625
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a rumor that's out right now is that a Zelda movie is on the way out.

521
00:35:19,346 --> 00:35:26,235
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know about this, but this came out of Club Nintendo, which is a Mexican publication that's very similar to Nintendo Power.

522
00:35:27,216 --> 00:35:27,577
[SPEAKER_04]: It was...

523
00:35:28,798 --> 00:35:38,761
[SPEAKER_04]: Reggie Phil's Aim was the guy at Nintendo that actually talked to this magazine about it, saying that they want to do Metroid, and then Zelda would be next in line.

524
00:35:39,041 --> 00:35:49,744
[SPEAKER_04]: But the weird thing about this is that I thought that John Woo got the rights to Metroid, but this is indicating that Nintendo actually somehow bought this back, and I didn't know that that had happened.

525
00:35:50,364 --> 00:35:50,584
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

526
00:35:51,989 --> 00:35:53,950
[SPEAKER_04]: I wouldn't trust it unless it's official Nintendo

527
00:36:14,753 --> 00:36:16,955
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, because the games are so freaking phenomenal.

528
00:36:16,975 --> 00:36:20,637
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, Metroid's great too, but I don't know.

529
00:36:20,717 --> 00:36:22,799
[SPEAKER_04]: Zelda seems like one of those things where it's already a movie.

530
00:36:23,039 --> 00:36:24,280
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't need another movie.

531
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:26,561
[SPEAKER_00]: If they did, they would have to do it right.

532
00:36:27,162 --> 00:36:28,303
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I would hope they would.

533
00:36:29,003 --> 00:36:29,303
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

534
00:36:30,244 --> 00:36:36,028
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie, you had another story for us about one of the Xbox 360 launch games might be kind of buggy.

535
00:36:36,068 --> 00:36:36,689
[SPEAKER_04]: What's going on with this?

536
00:36:37,609 --> 00:36:44,234
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Rare has stated that they took a very big risk with Perfect Dark Zero.

537
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:47,141
[SPEAKER_00]: so that it would be released on launch day.

538
00:36:47,781 --> 00:36:59,487
[SPEAKER_00]: They said typically it goes through a certification process to finish it up and then it's released to be manufactured, but they've gone ahead and released it to manufacturing without it going through their certification process.

539
00:36:59,787 --> 00:37:04,149
[SPEAKER_00]: They actually said they gave the go-ahead five days before the game certification.

540
00:37:05,209 --> 00:37:05,589
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

541
00:37:05,609 --> 00:37:13,713
[SPEAKER_00]: And if their certification doesn't pass, it's actually quoted here that they would have hundreds of thousands of discs on their hands.

542
00:37:14,693 --> 00:37:17,575
[SPEAKER_04]: That is a huge risk because that's a big penalty.

543
00:37:17,876 --> 00:37:19,557
[SPEAKER_04]: I know Microsoft is huge.

544
00:37:19,877 --> 00:37:22,039
[SPEAKER_04]: All the game companies really are is huge on those.

545
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:24,000
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, everything's got to be right and certified.

546
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:26,582
[SPEAKER_04]: That is a huge risk you're taking there.

547
00:37:26,963 --> 00:37:31,326
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess Rare kind of working directly with Microsoft can get away with it a little more.

548
00:37:31,366 --> 00:37:33,868
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's crazy.

549
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:36,190
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope the game makes it or we're all in trouble.

550
00:37:36,727 --> 00:37:45,411
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's also stated on there, though, that Rare puts a lot of work into polishing the game, so they're sure that it's going to be okay.

551
00:37:45,651 --> 00:37:48,893
[SPEAKER_00]: But they've produced 700,000 copies for the U.S.

552
00:37:49,553 --> 00:37:49,953
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

553
00:37:50,354 --> 00:37:55,196
[SPEAKER_00]: So that every person who has an Xbox 360 will also have that title.

554
00:37:55,736 --> 00:37:56,836
[SPEAKER_05]: Now we know how many are coming out.

555
00:37:56,856 --> 00:38:00,797
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's their estimate.

556
00:38:01,257 --> 00:38:02,077
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the estimate.

557
00:38:02,217 --> 00:38:06,258
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I would think that they would know what they're talking about as soon as they have to communicate directly with Microsoft.

558
00:38:06,458 --> 00:38:11,159
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, wait, Microsoft, you said that we're only getting... But that doesn't mean we're getting 700,000 of them on Tuesday.

559
00:38:11,259 --> 00:38:14,320
[SPEAKER_04]: That just means they're making 700,000 of them for the first run.

560
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:16,500
[SPEAKER_04]: First run, first launch.

561
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:21,481
[SPEAKER_00]: That also, though, explains why the game hasn't been available for review by some place.

562
00:38:21,857 --> 00:38:26,218
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of which, by the way, not only that, we've got more problems with Perfect Dark Zero.

563
00:38:26,238 --> 00:38:33,200
[SPEAKER_05]: It was supposed to be out on Friday, but apparently they're having trouble getting it to the United States because it has to ship from China now.

564
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:39,221
[SPEAKER_05]: They're running way behind schedule to delay it to launch day instead of before launch day, which was interesting.

565
00:38:39,361 --> 00:38:42,222
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're not even sure if it's going to be there on launch day either.

566
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:45,043
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's probably why you can't find it in stores right now either.

567
00:38:45,803 --> 00:38:46,203
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

568
00:38:46,463 --> 00:38:48,764
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if anything, then if it's having to go from...

569
00:38:50,339 --> 00:38:51,980
[SPEAKER_00]: Joanna Dark does not feature jumping.

570
00:39:19,335 --> 00:39:20,356
[SPEAKER_05]: She cannot jump.

571
00:39:21,497 --> 00:39:22,657
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what good is she then?

572
00:39:23,938 --> 00:39:25,099
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, as long as she's got boobs.

573
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:26,280
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey.

574
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:26,900
[SPEAKER_04]: Just kidding.

575
00:39:27,421 --> 00:39:27,721
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

576
00:39:28,341 --> 00:39:39,069
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of the Xbox 360, now, the other week we were talking about the backwards compatibility and how there's like 200 games that are going to be backwards compatible here in the U.S., and people are saying, that's not enough, that's not enough.

577
00:39:39,349 --> 00:39:40,169
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, guess what, kids?

578
00:39:40,229 --> 00:39:46,434
[SPEAKER_04]: Be thankful you don't live in Japan, because guess how many games are going to be backwards compatible at launch in Japan?

579
00:39:47,568 --> 00:39:49,310
[SPEAKER_04]: 12.

580
00:39:48,249 --> 00:39:49,310
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it, 12.

581
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:54,995
[SPEAKER_04]: Now they promised they'll be adding more and more, but all you're getting the first run through is 12.

582
00:39:55,715 --> 00:40:07,846
[SPEAKER_04]: Now granted, these are probably some of the biggest games, Halo, Halo 2, Ninja Gaiden, Rainbow Six, Crimson Skies, Fable, and then of course, Simpsons Hit and Run is just randomly in there too.

583
00:40:08,615 --> 00:40:09,455
[SPEAKER_04]: Xbox Live Arcade

584
00:40:32,566 --> 00:40:37,328
[SPEAKER_05]: and they have a ton of stuff out there going to be available for you to download.

585
00:40:37,968 --> 00:40:42,250
[SPEAKER_05]: But they've actually released what they're going to be releasing initially.

586
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:51,774
[SPEAKER_05]: For old retro games, they've got Gauntlet, Robotron, as well as Joust, which will be really cool.

587
00:40:53,674 --> 00:40:55,615
[SPEAKER_05]: Smash TV, which I thought was really neat.

588
00:40:56,556 --> 00:40:59,017
[SPEAKER_05]: Then, of course, my favorite, which is going to be...

589
00:41:01,058 --> 00:41:01,578
[SPEAKER_05]: Hectix, Bejeweled 2

590
00:41:15,546 --> 00:41:21,628
[SPEAKER_05]: and then, of course, my favorite, Geometry Wars Retro Evolved, which seems to be everybody's favorite out there.

591
00:41:22,048 --> 00:41:23,048
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are going to be available.

592
00:41:23,268 --> 00:41:25,769
[SPEAKER_05]: Most of the games are actually going to be available for either $5 to $10.

593
00:41:26,229 --> 00:41:29,550
[SPEAKER_05]: Geometry Wars and some of the better ones are actually going to be $5.

594
00:41:29,610 --> 00:41:30,611
[SPEAKER_05]: A few of them are going to be $10.

595
00:41:32,391 --> 00:41:35,052
[SPEAKER_05]: Some Billiards game is $15 for download.

596
00:41:35,132 --> 00:41:36,253
[SPEAKER_05]: Ooh, it's a top-shelf game.

597
00:41:36,273 --> 00:41:38,434
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all about Smash TV, though.

598
00:41:38,814 --> 00:41:41,696
[SPEAKER_05]: Smash TV, though, I think that was one of the ones that's $5, which is cool.

599
00:41:42,496 --> 00:41:43,516
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I would hope so.

600
00:41:43,536 --> 00:41:45,077
[SPEAKER_04]: It has the best quotes in it.

601
00:41:45,417 --> 00:41:51,300
[SPEAKER_04]: But considering you can buy it as part of a $20 pack with 20 games, it's really only worth a dollar.

602
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:55,082
[SPEAKER_00]: Considering I already owe three copies of it and the meme, I mean...

603
00:41:55,615 --> 00:41:56,095
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, all right.

604
00:41:56,135 --> 00:41:57,015
[SPEAKER_05]: But here's the cool thing, though.

605
00:41:57,035 --> 00:41:59,576
[SPEAKER_05]: At least they do have free demos you can try out.

606
00:41:59,676 --> 00:42:01,537
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can try these games before you buy them.

607
00:42:02,157 --> 00:42:02,717
[SPEAKER_05]: That's nice.

608
00:42:03,458 --> 00:42:10,680
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to have free demos for other games, like Need for Speed and Most Wanted are going to be on there, as well as some of the other EA games and stuff.

609
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:11,740
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of cool.

610
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:14,881
[SPEAKER_05]: And, of course, more gamer tags you can purchase and all that stuff.

611
00:42:15,141 --> 00:42:16,422
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of ways to waste your money.

612
00:42:16,662 --> 00:42:17,362
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

613
00:42:18,242 --> 00:42:20,083
[SPEAKER_00]: We are all about wasting time and money.

614
00:42:21,027 --> 00:42:30,591
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't want to waste all your money on video games, though, because, you know, if you spent all your days playing video games, you'd have no time to go out and spend your money on strippers, like Loki did this past week, right, Loki?

615
00:42:31,131 --> 00:42:31,811
[SPEAKER_04]: That was yesterday.

616
00:42:31,831 --> 00:42:48,298
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, anyway, so here to always remind us that there is a real life outside of gaming is the one and only DarkSakura, and it's been a couple weeks since she's been able to give you a piece of her advice, so here it is, DarkSakura's advice column, and DarkSakura, what are you going to be talking to us about tonight?

617
00:42:49,258 --> 00:42:52,920
[SPEAKER_00]: Today's bit of advice is how to leap from a motorcycle to a car.

618
00:42:55,121 --> 00:42:52,920
1.

619
00:42:55,562 --> 00:42:58,083
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure the vehicles are moving at the same speed.

620
00:42:58,103 --> 00:42:58,083
2.

621
00:43:00,124 --> 00:43:05,988
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait for a long straight section of road before positioning the vehicles as close as possible to each other.

622
00:43:06,488 --> 00:43:11,211
[SPEAKER_00]: You will be on the passenger side of the car, so you will be very close to the edge of the roadway.

623
00:43:12,492 --> 00:43:11,211
3.

624
00:43:12,932 --> 00:43:17,995
[SPEAKER_00]: Crouch with both of your feet on the running board or the seat and hold the throttle until the last instant.

625
00:43:18,547 --> 00:43:21,889
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, as soon as you release the throttle, the bike speed will decrease.

626
00:43:22,910 --> 00:43:21,889
4.

627
00:43:23,611 --> 00:43:27,153
[SPEAKER_00]: If the car has an inside handle above the door, grab it.

628
00:43:27,453 --> 00:43:30,575
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, simply time the leap so your torso lands in the car.

629
00:43:31,076 --> 00:43:33,517
[SPEAKER_00]: If you miss the window, tuck and roll away from the vehicles.

630
00:43:34,738 --> 00:43:33,517
5.

631
00:43:35,198 --> 00:43:37,980
[SPEAKER_00]: Have the driver swerve away from the bike as soon as you re inside.

632
00:43:38,241 --> 00:43:41,403
[SPEAKER_00]: The bike may slip under the rear passenger side wheel of the car.

633
00:43:42,063 --> 00:43:43,684
[SPEAKER_00]: But my final piece of advice?

634
00:43:43,864 --> 00:43:44,125
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

635
00:43:47,377 --> 00:43:49,758
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't try jumping into a car while it's moving.

636
00:43:49,778 --> 00:43:50,419
[SPEAKER_00]: That's stupid.

637
00:43:52,379 --> 00:43:53,700
[SPEAKER_05]: Or at least tell the guy to stop.

638
00:43:55,241 --> 00:43:56,321
[SPEAKER_00]: Just shoot him first.

639
00:43:56,461 --> 00:43:56,841
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

640
00:43:58,602 --> 00:43:59,002
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

641
00:43:59,182 --> 00:44:09,007
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you shoot the tires and then throw the guy out of the car and then drive off somewhere where you can change the tire.

642
00:44:10,668 --> 00:44:10,988
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

643
00:44:11,288 --> 00:44:12,188
[SPEAKER_04]: That's much easier.

644
00:44:12,388 --> 00:44:13,189
[SPEAKER_00]: Much easier.

645
00:44:13,569 --> 00:44:15,730
[SPEAKER_04]: For the love of God, don't tell him you saw it in a video game.

646
00:44:17,048 --> 00:44:18,669
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, don't tell... No, no, no, no.

647
00:44:19,169 --> 00:44:22,411
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell them that you saw it on the edited GTA 3.

648
00:44:22,971 --> 00:44:29,594
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of which, Pursuit Force is available for purchase for the PSP coming this spring.

649
00:44:30,575 --> 00:44:33,936
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't want to say the words Jack Thompson, but what you said kind of made me think of that.

650
00:44:33,996 --> 00:44:38,038
[SPEAKER_04]: I heard he got, like, booted off that case in Alabama or something, and the judge yelled at him or something.

651
00:44:38,138 --> 00:44:39,579
[SPEAKER_04]: I might be kind of... He didn't get booted.

652
00:44:39,619 --> 00:44:40,359
[SPEAKER_04]: He quit.

653
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:41,340
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't.

654
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:42,060
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not what I read.

655
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:42,741
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a big loser.

656
00:44:43,181 --> 00:44:43,441
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, well.

657
00:44:43,641 --> 00:44:47,324
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm just amused by his Amazon rating.

658
00:44:47,364 --> 00:44:51,447
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it, 37,000 on Amazon's list?

659
00:44:51,527 --> 00:44:52,948
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't give him a free plug.

660
00:44:52,968 --> 00:44:58,132
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, speaking of which, people that like the Jack Thompson book also recommend gay porno books as well.

661
00:44:58,773 --> 00:44:59,113
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

662
00:44:59,313 --> 00:44:59,674
[SPEAKER_00]: Really.

663
00:45:02,396 --> 00:45:03,076
[SPEAKER_04]: That's an insult.

664
00:45:03,176 --> 00:45:06,219
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just making fun of him because he's a loser.

665
00:45:06,359 --> 00:45:11,623
[SPEAKER_00]: He does nothing but embarrass himself, so I think he's a good point of humor.

666
00:45:12,136 --> 00:45:14,658
[SPEAKER_04]: Gay pornography can at least be artistic sometimes.

667
00:45:15,778 --> 00:45:17,319
[SPEAKER_04]: Jack Thompson's work, never artistic.

668
00:45:19,741 --> 00:45:21,141
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk about The Matrix Online.

669
00:45:21,182 --> 00:45:22,903
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, this was a game you played for about, what, three days?

670
00:45:24,536 --> 00:45:29,058
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought this game was shut down!

671
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:31,139
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's saying that the Matrix Online is still going.

672
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:35,302
[SPEAKER_04]: They did a server consolidation, I think, but they didn't shut it down.

673
00:45:36,062 --> 00:45:44,906
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, they are doing another update, it's update number 38, and they're going to be doing in-game advertising, courtesy of Massive.

674
00:45:44,946 --> 00:45:49,188
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be doing the in-game advertising using the billboards.

675
00:45:50,669 --> 00:46:02,653
[SPEAKER_04]: They kind of already do some real world product advertising, but now they're going to do stuff, you know, that's bought advertising because the advertising they had before was for like, let's say the clothing was used in the game.

676
00:46:02,773 --> 00:46:04,494
[SPEAKER_04]: They'd give that clothing company free advertising.

677
00:46:04,974 --> 00:46:08,455
[SPEAKER_04]: So now they're going to do, I guess, selling for the advertising, whatever.

678
00:46:09,776 --> 00:46:14,217
[SPEAKER_04]: And that those ads will be refreshing and updating with pretty good frequency in the game there.

679
00:46:14,317 --> 00:46:15,918
[SPEAKER_04]: So very interesting.

680
00:46:17,194 --> 00:46:20,958
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just kind of surprised that the game still has such a large following.

681
00:46:21,698 --> 00:46:23,300
[SPEAKER_05]: Seeing as they killed off all the characters.

682
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:36,012
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I don't want to bash on Matrix Online, because it seemed alright, and I can see where people get into it, because it does continue the Matrix story, but I don't know, it doesn't have that same play me, play me, over and over again like some of the other MMOs do.

683
00:46:36,032 --> 00:46:36,872
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

684
00:46:37,313 --> 00:46:38,454
[SPEAKER_04]: I enjoy the Matrix games.

685
00:46:38,494 --> 00:46:39,735
[SPEAKER_04]: Ragnarok Online!

686
00:46:39,755 --> 00:46:42,778
[SPEAKER_04]: Not just Ragnarok, but Final Fantasy, Warcraft, hell anything!

687
00:46:44,601 --> 00:46:53,486
[SPEAKER_00]: For all those people who are willing to play the sort of mindless rounds of PSO, and yes, I was one of them.

688
00:46:54,047 --> 00:46:56,848
[SPEAKER_00]: It has its addictions.

689
00:46:58,009 --> 00:47:02,592
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, what do you have considering release dates in the UK?

690
00:47:03,912 --> 00:47:05,413
[SPEAKER_00]: I have quite a few.

691
00:47:07,274 --> 00:47:13,458
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're looking at so far, we have Call of Cthulhu, Dark Corners of the Earth, which I'm interested in.

692
00:47:14,161 --> 00:47:20,624
[SPEAKER_00]: Bubble Bobble Revolution on the DS Crash Tag Team Racing for the PSP Is this all this week?

693
00:47:21,765 --> 00:47:42,735
[SPEAKER_00]: The 25th Dr. Mario and Puzzle League on the GBA Dragon Ball Z Super Sonic Warriors 2 Gun Kirby Canvas Curse on the DS Mario Kart DS also on the 25th Need for Speed Most Wanted Pro Evolution Soccer 5 Psychonauts Rugby Challenge 2006

694
00:47:44,158 --> 00:47:52,544
[SPEAKER_00]: Sega Classics Collection, Ski Racing 2006, Tales of Eternia, The Incredibles Rise of the Underminer, and Touch Golf.

695
00:47:53,525 --> 00:48:09,377
[SPEAKER_00]: Also to be announced, we have Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, and Pac-Man World 3, a few other things coming out, Snowboard Kids DS, those are all scheduled to be out sometime this month, we just don't have a date on it.

696
00:48:10,091 --> 00:48:10,431
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

697
00:48:10,672 --> 00:48:10,932
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

698
00:48:10,972 --> 00:48:12,313
[SPEAKER_04]: That for our friends over in the UK.

699
00:48:12,373 --> 00:48:15,636
[SPEAKER_04]: And here in the US, I don't have a calendar in front of me for the US, but...

700
00:48:16,525 --> 00:48:20,286
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything's all about the 360 this next week, and that's what a lot of people have been talking about.

701
00:48:20,306 --> 00:48:23,807
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's been a lot of great games released for other systems here this past week, too.

702
00:48:23,847 --> 00:48:29,628
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we had Mario Kart DS, we had the Ultramix, we had Call of Duty on other systems as well.

703
00:48:29,728 --> 00:48:31,668
[SPEAKER_04]: Call of Duty, Big Red One, yeah.

704
00:48:31,708 --> 00:48:33,468
[SPEAKER_04]: Just lots of games coming out this week.

705
00:48:33,488 --> 00:48:40,730
[SPEAKER_05]: This week was, or last week I should say, was one of the biggest launch weeks of the year.

706
00:48:41,370 --> 00:48:41,770
[SPEAKER_05]: It always is.

707
00:48:41,910 --> 00:48:43,491
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait, this is the Big Red One?

708
00:48:44,491 --> 00:48:45,731
[SPEAKER_00]: I need somebody who was in that.

709
00:48:46,394 --> 00:48:47,475
[SPEAKER_00]: PSP Advanced

710
00:49:04,886 --> 00:49:31,592
[SPEAKER_05]: but for the PSP so it allows you to put on video and mp3s and stuff very simple like and you can also play a lot of different formats that you couldn't play before like DivX files and whatnot and basically this program goes on your PSP runs on homebrew so it's you know made by an actual you know commercial company that's you know doing this and what's really cool is they were talking about selling it at first but they've decided to go ahead and release a

711
00:49:32,152 --> 00:49:32,373
[SPEAKER_05]: and so on.

712
00:49:53,396 --> 00:49:53,977
[SPEAKER_05]: Sounds cool.

713
00:49:54,137 --> 00:49:55,558
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, that's really neat.

714
00:49:55,878 --> 00:50:02,324
[SPEAKER_05]: The other thing which, of course, I'm excited about because, you know, Orange Laundry is all about the Bomani games is PSP Revolution.

715
00:50:04,039 --> 00:50:04,539
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

716
00:50:28,277 --> 00:50:36,043
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, we're going to go over to our mailbag because it's been a little while since... Well, actually, I snuck into the mailbag when you weren't here last week, DarkSakura.

717
00:50:36,063 --> 00:50:36,603
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope you don't mind.

718
00:50:36,783 --> 00:50:38,685
[SPEAKER_04]: I snuck in there and stole some letters.

719
00:50:40,186 --> 00:50:40,746
[SPEAKER_03]: You're allowed.

720
00:50:41,066 --> 00:50:45,670
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, but DarkSakura is going to read us some letters that are in our mailbox.

721
00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:52,575
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you want to send us an email, it's togo, T-O-G-O, at orangeloungeradio.com is the place to send your letters.

722
00:50:52,835 --> 00:50:53,976
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, what do we have this week?

723
00:50:56,015 --> 00:51:00,218
[SPEAKER_00]: My email I'd like to read is from our good buddy, Asian Buddy Paul.

724
00:51:00,798 --> 00:51:01,058
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

725
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:07,303
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't get the article to pull up because it says you have to be a member of that site, and I was like, meh.

726
00:51:07,963 --> 00:51:09,324
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'll go ahead and read the email.

727
00:51:09,344 --> 00:51:20,712
[SPEAKER_00]: It said, hey LLR, I just encountered an article talking about current developments on educational video games and how professors are continuing to take them seriously as fundamental learning tools.

728
00:51:21,112 --> 00:51:22,013
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you guys think?

729
00:51:22,455 --> 00:51:27,356
[SPEAKER_00]: Will we see real great educational and fun video games popping up in schools in several years?

730
00:51:27,996 --> 00:51:34,478
[SPEAKER_00]: Not just like the classics in elementary school like Word Muncher, but like some similar ones to the ones stated in the article.

731
00:51:34,538 --> 00:51:36,158
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I couldn't get the article to pull up.

732
00:51:36,718 --> 00:51:40,479
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe games that teach English to non-native speakers or foreign languages.

733
00:51:40,659 --> 00:51:42,440
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just sort of skipping around now.

734
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:44,360
[SPEAKER_00]: Japanese, French, Spanish, Chinese, to name a few.

735
00:51:45,698 --> 00:51:55,282
[SPEAKER_00]: As for real life scenario games involving ethics in real life situations like firing someone in tough decisions, I'm slightly skeptical, but I could see them put into intriguing action adventure games.

736
00:51:56,003 --> 00:51:57,463
[SPEAKER_00]: Sex Education the Video Game.

737
00:51:58,143 --> 00:51:59,564
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, just asking what you guys think.

738
00:52:01,357 --> 00:52:03,437
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kind of surprised that this is news.

739
00:52:03,658 --> 00:52:09,480
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I kind of thought we were using computers and games for education type scenarios for a long time.

740
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:14,242
[SPEAKER_04]: In my profession, actually, I'm not sure, you know, my day job, what I do is I actually teach people.

741
00:52:14,262 --> 00:52:15,043
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a corporate trainer.

742
00:52:15,483 --> 00:52:18,184
[SPEAKER_04]: And I like to use computer-based things all the time.

743
00:52:18,204 --> 00:52:26,548
[SPEAKER_04]: And sometimes that might be a scenario where, you know, they actually choose, like, multiple choice questions that will alter the scenario of events.

744
00:52:26,568 --> 00:52:28,509
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I don't want to give away too much of what it is I do, but...

745
00:52:29,069 --> 00:52:33,392
[SPEAKER_04]: There might be like a multiple choice thing and it changes the events and they watch what happens to their character.

746
00:52:34,292 --> 00:52:41,637
[SPEAKER_04]: In some aspects, and of course, you know, naming back to the classics there, we've all been using that game element in teaching for a long time.

747
00:52:41,677 --> 00:52:43,258
[SPEAKER_04]: Like Jeopardy, that's an old classic.

748
00:52:43,298 --> 00:52:45,599
[SPEAKER_04]: I use that for review all the time in my class.

749
00:52:45,719 --> 00:52:46,960
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I don't know.

750
00:52:47,820 --> 00:52:55,585
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe it would help me to know, like, I'm assuming the article is talking a little more about console games and what the rest of us kind of think of as game games.

751
00:52:56,488 --> 00:52:59,791
[SPEAKER_04]: We need a return to Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego Where's Mario?

752
00:52:59,811 --> 00:53:01,852
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times the games are easy to use for younger people

753
00:53:25,259 --> 00:53:26,000
[SPEAKER_00]: Photoshop 3D

754
00:53:50,937 --> 00:53:54,400
[SPEAKER_04]: A class is only as good as the games that are taught in it.

755
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:54,980
[SPEAKER_04]: No, forget it.

756
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:55,720
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

757
00:53:57,622 --> 00:53:58,883
[SPEAKER_04]: You got one more quick email for us?

758
00:53:59,523 --> 00:54:00,864
[SPEAKER_00]: One more from Rini.

759
00:54:01,644 --> 00:54:01,985
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

760
00:54:03,946 --> 00:54:18,196
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to sort of paraphrase a bit, basically stating that one particular reason not everyone should run out to buy a 360 or PS3 or whatever on its launch date is possible problems with faults in the console.

761
00:54:18,216 --> 00:54:19,297
[SPEAKER_00]: Rini,

762
00:54:20,478 --> 00:54:25,560
[SPEAKER_00]: Just stating again, I am reminded of the PS2 launch when the thing erased memory cards and something else.

763
00:54:26,140 --> 00:54:33,483
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, we did not encounter this, but then you'd have to go out to your nearest retailer and get an append disc or mentioning of an upgrade station.

764
00:54:34,003 --> 00:54:46,128
[SPEAKER_00]: Another reason is dealing with, I guess, the quality of the systems, holding off for something that might be better down the line, and also wanting to know where the ferrets are.

765
00:54:47,915 --> 00:54:50,296
[SPEAKER_04]: The ferrets were around here somewhere.

766
00:54:51,236 --> 00:54:54,057
[SPEAKER_04]: They might have died from starvation because you haven't been here, actually.

767
00:54:54,077 --> 00:54:55,137
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure what's going on.

768
00:54:55,417 --> 00:54:57,638
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't been there to keep them warm with my love.

769
00:54:57,698 --> 00:54:58,218
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, hold on.

770
00:55:00,098 --> 00:55:00,639
[SPEAKER_04]: They're still here.

771
00:55:00,659 --> 00:55:02,379
[SPEAKER_04]: Where's my baby?

772
00:55:02,939 --> 00:55:04,780
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course I say that and my cat looks up.

773
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:07,700
[SPEAKER_00]: Now she's not in here.

774
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:08,721
[SPEAKER_00]: Now she left.

775
00:55:08,761 --> 00:55:09,341
[SPEAKER_00]: She's offended.

776
00:55:10,424 --> 00:55:14,706
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah, but it depends on how much you use them, too, because you don't game all day long, nor do I.

777
00:55:41,621 --> 00:55:45,762
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true, and we hear that they were not good for DVD players, the first few.

778
00:55:47,323 --> 00:55:58,427
[SPEAKER_00]: With any of those systems, especially with the PS2, the more you use it as a dedicated DVD player, the more chance you have of ruining the system itself by that motor drive.

779
00:55:59,247 --> 00:56:06,930
[SPEAKER_05]: My PS2 got it at launch date, and I'm using it as my dedicated DVD player.

780
00:56:07,779 --> 00:56:08,519
[SPEAKER_05]: Perfectly fine.

781
00:56:08,559 --> 00:56:12,100
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you have a satanic curse in your house that keeps that thing running, is what it is.

782
00:56:14,381 --> 00:56:22,803
[SPEAKER_00]: I've actually known plenty of people who use theirs as their primary DVD player and have had nothing but problems.

783
00:56:23,263 --> 00:56:26,704
[SPEAKER_04]: I use my Xbox as my primary DVD player, but I don't play games on it.

784
00:56:26,864 --> 00:56:28,404
[SPEAKER_03]: But the Xbox was made quite a bit better.

785
00:56:28,786 --> 00:56:30,427
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the Xbox was made quite a bit better.

786
00:56:30,447 --> 00:56:33,328
[SPEAKER_04]: And since I paid extra for that DVD kit, you better believe it's going to work.

787
00:56:34,869 --> 00:56:36,269
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, Loki, we're running out of time.

788
00:56:36,310 --> 00:56:38,010
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, you got another story for us?

789
00:56:38,090 --> 00:56:38,831
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, real quick.

790
00:56:39,151 --> 00:56:43,173
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, we got to still talk about the 360 launch being that it is on Tuesday.

791
00:56:43,193 --> 00:56:44,033
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

792
00:56:44,493 --> 00:56:50,276
[SPEAKER_05]: They had some craziness on Friday when Circuit City started taking pre-orders for what 360s they were going to have.

793
00:56:50,376 --> 00:56:51,997
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember what we mentioned last week.

794
00:56:52,117 --> 00:56:53,798
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, they're going to sell them in the stores on Friday.

795
00:56:53,838 --> 00:56:56,059
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure enough, the day after our podcast rolled out.

796
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:57,160
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh no, that was all a big lie.

797
00:56:57,500 --> 00:57:00,302
[SPEAKER_04]: So Circus City's... So they were being sold on their website.

798
00:57:00,322 --> 00:57:03,964
[SPEAKER_05]: They actually did have the units out of the bundle, so that was kind of interesting.

799
00:57:04,124 --> 00:57:08,827
[SPEAKER_05]: Or you could pre-order the bundle and delete the additional stuff on there, which is also interesting.

800
00:57:09,247 --> 00:57:11,669
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that was if you're lucky enough to be able to actually get through.

801
00:57:11,829 --> 00:57:17,933
[SPEAKER_05]: The site was hammered so much it went down as well as their entire technical support line was just jammed up.

802
00:57:18,593 --> 00:57:19,873
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was interesting.

803
00:57:20,133 --> 00:57:28,755
[SPEAKER_05]: There's actually people now camping for their 360 right now, but you can always assure that the celebrities are going to have one.

804
00:57:28,776 --> 00:57:33,297
[SPEAKER_05]: They had an LA launch party for the 360, and Paris Hilton has a bag with the 360.

805
00:57:33,337 --> 00:57:35,057
[SPEAKER_04]: That is so fucked up.

806
00:57:35,097 --> 00:57:36,657
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think Paris Hilton is going to play on her 360?

807
00:57:36,697 --> 00:57:38,898
[SPEAKER_05]: She doesn't know what a 360 is, okay?

808
00:57:38,938 --> 00:57:40,278
[SPEAKER_05]: That's basically that.

809
00:57:40,438 --> 00:57:43,039
[SPEAKER_05]: And then finally, my favorite store in the world.

810
00:57:43,579 --> 00:57:46,540
[SPEAKER_04]: That makes me mad that you won't get a 360, but Paris Hilton will.

811
00:57:46,780 --> 00:57:47,280
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on.

812
00:57:49,679 --> 00:57:50,500
[SPEAKER_04]: You know she's a big gamer.

813
00:57:52,001 --> 00:57:53,301
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, not video games.

814
00:57:53,502 --> 00:58:05,089
[SPEAKER_05]: My personal favorite is the ad for Best Buy showing the 360 and stating that it's the absolute latest in gaming that burns CDs and DVDs too.

815
00:58:05,189 --> 00:58:08,791
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Best Buy, for lying and not even knowing what the hell you're talking about.

816
00:58:09,672 --> 00:58:11,653
[SPEAKER_05]: I will not be going to Best Buy to buy anything for my 360.

817
00:58:12,254 --> 00:58:12,994
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.

818
00:58:13,414 --> 00:58:14,515
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just one mistake.

819
00:58:14,535 --> 00:58:15,756
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a printing mistake.

820
00:58:15,836 --> 00:58:16,656
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't blame the whole business.

821
00:58:16,676 --> 00:58:17,377
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's not why I'm...

822
00:58:20,590 --> 00:58:22,331
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys are vicious!

823
00:58:22,932 --> 00:58:24,253
[SPEAKER_00]: We sue you!

824
00:58:24,433 --> 00:58:25,834
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotta be vicious to keep up.

825
00:58:26,275 --> 00:58:29,017
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh man, I hate to be in line with you people on Tuesday.

826
00:58:30,499 --> 00:58:31,820
[SPEAKER_00]: Guess who's not going to be in line?

827
00:58:32,781 --> 00:58:33,762
[SPEAKER_04]: Look, don't rub it in.

828
00:58:34,162 --> 00:58:34,843
[SPEAKER_04]: Stop rubbing it in.

829
00:58:35,263 --> 00:58:36,504
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll come to your house and take it.

830
00:58:38,926 --> 00:58:39,787
[SPEAKER_05]: Real quick mentions.

831
00:58:40,088 --> 00:58:43,451
[SPEAKER_05]: If you pre-order Dirge of Service right now, you can actually get a

832
00:58:44,306 --> 00:58:49,650
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura has our last story tonight regarding gaming in another country We've got one actually published by Eurogamer

833
00:59:12,918 --> 00:59:18,841
[SPEAKER_00]: A group of German politicians proposed a ban on all video games that show lethal violence.

834
00:59:22,283 --> 00:59:23,323
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty much simply it?

835
00:59:25,184 --> 00:59:35,570
[SPEAKER_00]: They're actually... It's basically already looking at... I'm trying to find the group that was calling for this.

836
00:59:36,050 --> 00:59:41,373
[SPEAKER_00]: The Christian Social Union saying that killing games have no place in Germany's bedrooms.

837
00:59:42,709 --> 00:59:46,310
[SPEAKER_00]: There already, though, are having some folks against that.

838
00:59:47,011 --> 00:59:49,272
[SPEAKER_04]: If only you people knew what went on in my bedroom.

839
00:59:49,632 --> 00:59:51,052
[SPEAKER_04]: The gaming happens in the living room.

840
00:59:52,993 --> 00:59:54,073
[SPEAKER_04]: I shouldn't have said that on the radio.

841
00:59:55,134 --> 01:00:08,899
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the head of Germany's Interactive Software Association, Olaf Wolters, basically was quoted in Der Spiegel saying, as far as we're concerned, there are no such things as killer games, but adult games.

842
01:00:09,434 --> 01:00:09,674
[SPEAKER_00]: Very good.

843
01:00:09,694 --> 01:00:12,475
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're willing to work with the governments to resolve the issue.

844
01:00:14,015 --> 01:00:31,800
[SPEAKER_00]: It's stated also that Germany has some of the strictest censorship laws in the world, but they needed revision, especially after in 2002 a 19-year-old shot and killed 16 people in Erfurt before turning the gun on himself as he was also an avid player of Counter-Strike.

845
01:00:33,881 --> 01:00:36,521
[SPEAKER_00]: They're saying the new legislation, if approved, will go into effect March 2008.

846
01:00:36,561 --> 01:00:36,882
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just...

847
01:00:39,476 --> 01:00:44,139
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a bunch of crazy people trying to ban things because they can't watch their kids.

848
01:00:44,219 --> 01:00:45,300
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just stupid.

849
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:46,660
[SPEAKER_04]: It won't happen.

850
01:00:47,181 --> 01:00:48,221
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what's going to happen, though?

851
01:00:48,821 --> 01:00:54,124
[SPEAKER_05]: The only way we're going to be able to solve violent games in Germany is to make more David Hasselhoff games.

852
01:00:54,244 --> 01:00:56,386
[SPEAKER_04]: I knew you were going to make a David Hasselhoff joke.

853
01:00:56,446 --> 01:01:01,168
[SPEAKER_04]: I was trying to think of a good Shiza porn joke, but I want to keep this a family show tonight.

854
01:01:03,069 --> 01:01:03,890
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie, your thoughts?

855
01:01:06,511 --> 01:01:07,112
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

856
01:01:07,392 --> 01:01:07,692
[SPEAKER_00]: You know,

857
01:01:09,611 --> 01:01:12,533
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really hard because you know how I feel about this.

858
01:01:12,553 --> 01:01:14,054
[SPEAKER_00]: Parents should be doing their jobs, right?

859
01:01:14,634 --> 01:01:19,797
[SPEAKER_00]: The manufacturer should also be taking responsibility to label their games correctly, yes?

860
01:01:21,518 --> 01:01:25,841
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't think that the government has any business poking their nose into it.

861
01:01:26,061 --> 01:01:31,464
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be left up to the consumer and up to the manufacturer to keep the consumer informed.

862
01:01:31,716 --> 01:01:34,957
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially with a statement as subjective as any violent game.

863
01:01:34,997 --> 01:01:36,118
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that could be anything.

864
01:01:36,178 --> 01:01:38,119
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, what's violent?

865
01:01:38,439 --> 01:01:41,920
[SPEAKER_04]: Is Tom and Jerry with a big cartoon hammer, is that violent?

866
01:01:42,281 --> 01:01:44,882
[SPEAKER_00]: You whack-a-mole the game, that's pretty violent.

867
01:01:44,942 --> 01:01:45,502
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.

868
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:49,984
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I hate, I hate, hate, hate, and it's what I hated about the California law.

869
01:01:50,024 --> 01:01:53,705
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate these subjective things that leave too much open to interpretation.

870
01:01:55,825 --> 01:01:59,466
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, that is going to do it for tonight's program.

871
01:02:00,026 --> 01:02:02,467
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

872
01:02:02,727 --> 01:02:05,148
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, your final thought, and then we're going to say goodbye to you.

873
01:02:06,328 --> 01:02:09,209
[SPEAKER_00]: Reject false icons and keep gaming.

874
01:02:09,950 --> 01:02:16,812
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, we're going to go ahead and click the Hang Up button now, DarkSakura, but thanks so much for sitting with us on Skype tonight, and we'll see you next time, okay?

875
01:02:17,312 --> 01:02:17,672
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye.

876
01:02:17,892 --> 01:02:18,372
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye-bye.

877
01:02:19,093 --> 01:02:20,053
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, your final thought.

878
01:02:22,298 --> 01:02:26,485
[SPEAKER_05]: My final thought is I'm going to beat this stupid Mario Kart DS.

879
01:02:26,806 --> 01:02:28,148
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to get robbed, finally.

880
01:02:29,089 --> 01:02:29,410
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

881
01:02:30,091 --> 01:02:33,998
[SPEAKER_04]: And my final thought is Tuesday, when you're all fighting those lines...

882
01:02:34,522 --> 01:02:41,924
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to be sitting back playing some World of Warcraft and Mario Kart DS and I'll just take my sweet ass time and buying that Xbox 360.

883
01:02:41,964 --> 01:02:42,485
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.

884
01:02:43,205 --> 01:02:48,526
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, we promised one more Midi Head song tonight before we close out so we're going to leave you guys with this tonight.

885
01:02:48,887 --> 01:02:50,647
[SPEAKER_04]: This is also from DDR Ultramix 3.

886
01:02:50,987 --> 01:02:52,688
[SPEAKER_04]: This is another Midi Head track.

887
01:02:52,708 --> 01:02:53,808
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember to check out his music.

[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see you next week.

892
