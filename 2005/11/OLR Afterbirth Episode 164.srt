1
00:00:00,273 --> 00:00:01,694
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, you guys listening live.

2
00:00:01,814 --> 00:00:02,535
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not over yet.

3
00:00:02,575 --> 00:00:09,640
[SPEAKER_02]: We still got a little more show for you guys, just for you guys, because we love the folks who take some time out on their Sunday to spend it with us.

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:10,800
[SPEAKER_02]: We really appreciate that.

5
00:00:11,181 --> 00:00:13,742
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the Orange Lounge Radio after birth.

6
00:00:14,443 --> 00:00:15,243
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just for you guys.

7
00:00:17,847 --> 00:00:18,087
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura

8
00:00:36,178 --> 00:00:55,707
[SPEAKER_00]: and then went out to buy lots of Pocky for people in Alabama and then went on to eat dinner at the Hard Rock Cafe and I did school work all the rest of the time and I got my new driver's license and my face is no longer humongous on it because it's 80 pounds less of me.

9
00:00:57,168 --> 00:00:58,108
[SPEAKER_00]: That was pretty exciting.

10
00:00:58,128 --> 00:00:59,109
[SPEAKER_05]: Congratulations, yeah.

11
00:00:59,729 --> 00:01:02,970
[SPEAKER_00]: And so just otherwise getting things ready to go to Alabama.

12
00:01:03,551 --> 00:01:04,371
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking forward to the trip.

13
00:01:09,183 --> 00:01:10,024
[SPEAKER_01]: Loki, how was your week?

14
00:01:10,044 --> 00:01:10,424
[SPEAKER_01]: How was your day?

15
00:01:23,032 --> 00:01:25,113
[SPEAKER_01]: To finalize how the ceremony is going to go.

16
00:01:26,634 --> 00:01:29,575
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, that's pretty much it.

17
00:01:29,775 --> 00:01:30,996
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been really busy.

18
00:01:32,277 --> 00:01:34,858
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I was just making sure the podcast saved okay.

19
00:01:35,018 --> 00:01:37,099
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit of Jamie's voice got thrown in there.

20
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:37,319
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

21
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,441
[SPEAKER_02]: So, okay.

22
00:01:41,641 --> 00:01:44,163
[SPEAKER_02]: My week and my day, it was pretty good.

23
00:01:44,383 --> 00:01:45,643
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, you know, I...

24
00:01:48,652 --> 00:01:49,593
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkDeft, Drew, Carameldansen

25
00:02:11,662 --> 00:02:12,462
[SPEAKER_02]: Donnie Darko

26
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:35,946
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, ex-girlfriend, is with a cast still over there in San Jose.

27
00:02:36,426 --> 00:02:37,566
[SPEAKER_02]: And we still talk to each other.

28
00:02:38,846 --> 00:02:44,067
[SPEAKER_02]: And she wanted to know if I was interested in helping them out because they needed somebody for a role.

29
00:02:44,087 --> 00:02:46,488
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, well, shit, I haven't done Rocky in over a year.

30
00:02:46,548 --> 00:02:47,288
[SPEAKER_02]: So I went and did that.

31
00:02:47,308 --> 00:02:48,048
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was a lot of fun.

32
00:02:48,328 --> 00:02:51,448
[SPEAKER_02]: But the only bummer about that is that I drove back after Rocky was over.

33
00:02:51,488 --> 00:02:52,429
[SPEAKER_02]: Rocky starts at midnight.

34
00:02:52,849 --> 00:02:55,949
[SPEAKER_02]: And then so I got on the road at 2.30 and didn't get home until about 5 o'clock.

35
00:02:56,989 --> 00:02:57,389
[SPEAKER_02]: But oh well.

36
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:00,290
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as my body doesn't reject it.

37
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,521
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, yeah, I knew that would happen.

38
00:03:02,561 --> 00:03:05,063
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody in the chat room is going, ha, ha, ha, girlfriend.

39
00:03:05,584 --> 00:03:11,349
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, well, you know, I have a long, sordid past that I'm not going into right now on this radio show.

40
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:16,953
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's get into the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match.

41
00:03:16,994 --> 00:03:21,437
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the part of the show where we play songs for your enjoyment, hopefully.

[SPEAKER_02]: And you want to be in our chat room if you want to participate.

43
00:03:25,741 --> 00:03:27,563
[SPEAKER_02]: I know some of you guys like to lurk out there.

44
00:03:27,603 --> 00:03:28,964
[SPEAKER_02]: You're listening, but you're not in chat room.

45
00:03:29,312 --> 00:03:29,872
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's fine.

46
00:03:30,312 --> 00:03:32,953
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, you have a right to your anonymity.

47
00:03:33,874 --> 00:03:37,595
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you want to be able to participate and choose the winner, you do have to be in our chat room.

[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get it started.

51

[SPEAKER_02]: The way a cage match works, we pick three songs for you guys.

52
00:03:45,397 --> 00:03:49,419
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys pick your favorite, and the winning song goes into rotation all week long.

53
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:53,140
[SPEAKER_02]: You're on Orange Lounge Radio's Labani and Video Game Music program.

54
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:58,782
[SPEAKER_02]: Last week, DarkSakura won, and she decided to get a little creative and use a song that

55
00:03:59,096 --> 00:03:59,716
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

56
00:04:28,707 --> 00:04:39,438
[SPEAKER_03]: Was MC something or something, but I didn't hit save Which MC was that, I couldn't say Wait a minute, was it MC Chicken in the hat?

57
00:04:39,538 --> 00:04:42,100
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember him, he was a fat dude Wait, was he thin?

58
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:52,891
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I know I've seen his video Up on the box with the dirty ass beaks Calling Rooster's car, got a feather like a pimp Swingin' up on the side MC Chicken in the hat got pride But I can't recall if it was in my night

59
00:04:55,084 --> 00:04:56,145
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it MC Razzle Dazzle?

60
00:04:56,165 --> 00:04:57,226
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it MC Plain?

61
00:04:57,246 --> 00:04:59,948
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it MC in the mirror, aka MC Vain?

62
00:04:59,988 --> 00:05:02,289
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it MC pain in my ears just to listen?

63
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:05,652
[SPEAKER_03]: Nah, if it was him, I wouldn't listen Was it MC Elephant?

64
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:12,377
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be relevant Because of how my memory got crooked, now it's Halibut Let me think, I'ma figure out What MC are they talking about?

65
00:05:12,577 --> 00:05:13,838
[SPEAKER_03]: Which MC was that?

66
00:05:13,898 --> 00:05:20,362
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't recollect I heard him on the internet Was MC Fuss or something, but I didn't hit save Which MC was that?

67
00:05:20,402 --> 00:05:21,043
[SPEAKER_03]: I couldn't say

68
00:05:25,603 --> 00:05:29,564
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it was MC, matter of fact, he got the authentic, easy riding his act.

69
00:05:29,705 --> 00:05:31,805
[SPEAKER_03]: Always speaking the truth, never fronts one bit.

70
00:05:31,825 --> 00:05:33,946
[SPEAKER_03]: He and DJ so sincere, don't quit.

71
00:05:34,006 --> 00:05:36,207
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think for some reason that it wasn't him.

72
00:05:36,427 --> 00:05:39,568
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, was it MC out on a limb with a very risky rapping?

73
00:05:39,588 --> 00:05:41,229
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't know what happened to the time.

74
00:05:41,289 --> 00:05:41,849
[SPEAKER_03]: Verbal control.

75
00:05:41,949 --> 00:05:42,610
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

76
00:05:57,836 --> 00:06:19,386
[SPEAKER_03]: to be certain, was it MC Hot behind the curtain, calling, pay no attention to the man on the mic, must be a wizard when he runs so tight, you're having difficulty judging out your brain, the fact, which MC was that, which MC was that, I can't recollect, I heard him on the internet, was MC Hot or something, but I didn't hit save, which MC was that, I couldn't say, I couldn't say.

77
00:06:21,564 --> 00:06:39,162
[SPEAKER_03]: Step up Poindex to act smarter than you are About to pull the MC name out the jar And whoever gets closest wins a nine-sided die And a gift certificate to prize, yo The moniker is MC Front a lot I got a fuss one bag, a nerdcore hip-hop And my mail list busted, a hundred so I'm famous It's unbelievable nobody know what my name is

78
00:06:50,363 --> 00:06:52,527
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, that was a clip from song number one.

79
00:06:52,567 --> 00:06:55,250
[SPEAKER_02]: That was MC Frontalot with which MC was that?

80
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:56,452
[SPEAKER_02]: It was last week's winner.

81
00:06:56,993 --> 00:07:02,541
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just might win again this week, but first, it's got to go up against a couple of other songs.

82
00:07:02,581 --> 00:07:04,083
[SPEAKER_02]: The first song is going to be my pick.

83
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:06,066
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right, I get to pick the next song.

84
00:07:06,713 --> 00:07:11,175
[SPEAKER_02]: and I decided to pick a song from a free CD I got this week.

85
00:07:11,495 --> 00:07:17,677
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually ordered some Echo Image CDs from a different drum and I was very happy because there's B-sides and I love new Echo Image songs.

86
00:07:17,737 --> 00:07:18,357
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm very, very happy.

87
00:07:18,617 --> 00:07:21,338
[SPEAKER_02]: But they also sent me a free synth pop sampler.

88
00:07:21,758 --> 00:07:24,439
[SPEAKER_02]: That made me happy, so I got to hear some new stuff, try some different bands out.

89
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:25,840
[SPEAKER_02]: And I liked this song.

90
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:29,541
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the melody in this song and that's why I'm picking this song.

91
00:07:29,581 --> 00:07:32,042
[SPEAKER_02]: The singing's a little odd to me, but maybe you guys will like it.

92
00:07:32,482 --> 00:07:35,383
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the melody and I think it's a great song, so I want to share it with you guys.

93
00:07:35,899 --> 00:07:39,280
[SPEAKER_02]: My pick for tonight's cage match is a song called Liquid Divine.

94
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:43,401
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, the group is called Liquid Divine, and the song is called Lotus.

95
00:07:43,861 --> 00:07:45,881
[SPEAKER_02]: So enjoy song number two tonight.

96
00:07:45,901 --> 00:07:48,502
[SPEAKER_02]: Liquid Divine

97
00:08:05,427 --> 00:08:06,708
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

98
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:45,820
We are the souls of decay, and all these years that have passed by, and you bewildered in my eye, and in these seconds satisfied, I really will tell you.

99
00:09:14,742 --> 00:09:15,542
DarkSakura, DarkSakura

100
00:09:46,403 --> 00:09:53,665
We made our icons on the wall To do today's decisions for what we're for Life and death are not to say We are

101
00:10:11,773 --> 00:10:13,095
Thanks for watching!

102
00:10:40,289 --> 00:10:41,312
Thanks for watching!

103
00:11:39,472 --> 00:11:40,272
Thanks for watching!

104
00:12:26,892 --> 00:12:31,634
[SPEAKER_02]: Song number two in tonight's Cat Age match, that was Liquid Divine with Lotus.

105
00:12:31,694 --> 00:12:36,935
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go around and see if the hosts thought it was Divine or just kind of Liquid Poop.

106
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:38,636
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.

107
00:12:39,156 --> 00:12:40,216
[SPEAKER_00]: Made me sleepy.

108
00:12:40,336 --> 00:12:41,377
[SPEAKER_00]: It was pretty, though.

109
00:12:41,617 --> 00:12:43,397
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, Loki.

110
00:12:43,557 --> 00:12:44,258
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like a seven.

111
00:12:44,298 --> 00:12:48,019
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't care for the synthy voices, but the music was good.

112
00:12:48,759 --> 00:12:53,361
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my problem with this song, too, is I hate the share effect on the voice, like way overdone, like five times.

113
00:12:53,661 --> 00:12:54,621
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I think, like, if a...

114
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:59,200
[SPEAKER_02]: But see, I think at the same time, like a trance girl singing that would be too cliche.

115
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:03,380
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think if the guy had just sang with his normal voice, I bet it would have been like a real kick-ass song.

116
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:10,642
[SPEAKER_02]: But for me, the way the synths are done, put it in that very dreamy music to F2 category.

117
00:13:12,102 --> 00:13:18,543
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, since it is the season and everything with Valentine's Day being on Tuesday, I'm going to go ahead and give that song a 9.

118
00:13:18,943 --> 00:13:20,503
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas usually I would have given that an 8.

119
00:13:20,963 --> 00:13:23,624
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, since it fits the holiday, I give myself a bonus point.

120
00:13:24,044 --> 00:13:24,284
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

121
00:13:25,893 --> 00:13:27,674
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, Loki, what did you pick for your song tonight?

122
00:13:28,555 --> 00:13:32,958
[SPEAKER_01]: I picked a song by a group called Evergreen, called The End.

123
00:13:33,378 --> 00:13:35,359
[SPEAKER_01]: It's completely picked out of random.

124
00:13:35,499 --> 00:13:38,861
[SPEAKER_01]: I just picked it up completely at random.

125
00:13:39,142 --> 00:13:40,382
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no idea if it's good or bad.

126
00:13:40,602 --> 00:13:41,763
[SPEAKER_02]: So, hope it's good.

127
00:13:42,203 --> 00:13:43,644
[SPEAKER_02]: Will minimal effort pay off?

128
00:13:43,684 --> 00:13:46,926
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll find out with song number three, Evergreen, with The End.

129
00:13:47,187 --> 00:13:47,867
[SPEAKER_02]: You're on the Cavematch.

130
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:50,040
Thanks for watching!

131
00:17:40,894 --> 00:17:44,175
[SPEAKER_02]: Song number three tonight, Evergreen with The End.

132
00:17:44,255 --> 00:17:45,676
[SPEAKER_02]: A last minute pick by Loki.

133
00:17:45,996 --> 00:17:47,737
[SPEAKER_02]: Did the last minute-ness pay off?

134
00:17:47,777 --> 00:17:49,117
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll find out, DarkSakura.

135
00:17:49,917 --> 00:17:52,798
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like the background music to some sort of airplane game.

136
00:17:53,699 --> 00:17:56,860
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, which I love airplane games, but it was kind of boring.

137
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:58,381
[SPEAKER_00]: They get the core.

138
00:17:59,221 --> 00:17:59,601
[SPEAKER_01]: Loki.

139
00:18:00,441 --> 00:18:01,742
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a horrible song.

140
00:18:01,942 --> 00:18:03,402
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what the hell I was thinking.

141
00:18:03,783 --> 00:18:05,743
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds like something that would be in the groove, so.

142
00:18:08,164 --> 00:18:08,564
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

143
00:18:08,584 --> 00:18:10,145
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to be sure it'll probably win.

144
00:18:12,937 --> 00:18:21,001
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna be a little bit nicer to the song because I could, I really could see that song like in a video game.

145
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:25,523
[SPEAKER_02]: My problem with it is that it sounds like it was done on somebody's keyboard in their basement.

[SPEAKER_02]: Song number one you can vote for is MC Frontalot.

151
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:02,166
[SPEAKER_02]: Which MC was that?

[SPEAKER_03]: And song number two you can vote for tonight is Liquid Divine with Lotus.

[SPEAKER_02]: Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.

156
00:19:43,521 --> 00:19:46,424
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you don't, you will be flogged repeatedly.

157
00:19:48,105 --> 00:19:49,046
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody watching the Olympics?

158
00:19:50,134 --> 00:19:50,735
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't watch TV.

159
00:19:51,436 --> 00:19:52,217
[SPEAKER_02]: Not even the Olympics?

160
00:19:52,278 --> 00:19:54,522
[SPEAKER_02]: I know some people that don't give a crap about sports.

161
00:19:54,542 --> 00:19:56,465
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish Mikhail Tav was still here because I know he's one of those people.

162
00:19:56,826 --> 00:19:59,892
[SPEAKER_02]: Doesn't give a crap about sports, but will watch the Olympics when they come on.

163
00:19:59,912 --> 00:20:01,034
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, I don't know, there's something...

164
00:20:02,739 --> 00:20:02,999
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

165
00:20:32,471 --> 00:20:56,012
[SPEAKER_00]: I've loved figure skating all the time because my mom used to do amateur roller skating and I studied it a little bit but really I've just not I do not put TV this is just my opinion of it I'm not saying anyone else says this I don't think of my television as my number one source of entertainment so therefore even though there may be a show I might be interested in or the Olympics or something big going on

166
00:20:56,644 --> 00:20:58,205
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think of it as TV.

167
00:20:58,285 --> 00:21:00,005
[SPEAKER_00]: I look online for the news.

168
00:21:01,566 --> 00:21:02,146
[SPEAKER_00]: The results.

169
00:21:03,087 --> 00:21:05,508
[SPEAKER_00]: It's never been a big thing to just sit and watch it.

170
00:21:06,528 --> 00:21:08,029
[SPEAKER_02]: Figure skating might be kind of boring this year anyway.

171
00:21:08,049 --> 00:21:09,129
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard Michelle Kwan pulled out.

172
00:21:09,169 --> 00:21:10,370
[SPEAKER_02]: She's always usually the best one to watch.

173
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:13,871
[SPEAKER_01]: They had a Date My Mom marathon on today.

174
00:21:14,051 --> 00:21:15,312
[SPEAKER_02]: God, please don't tell me you watched that.

175
00:21:15,532 --> 00:21:20,734
[SPEAKER_01]: I watched about two episodes of that because I couldn't reach the remote from where I was sitting.

176
00:21:20,754 --> 00:21:21,335
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

177
00:21:24,014 --> 00:21:27,298
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, um... That show is horribly scripted.

178
00:21:27,658 --> 00:21:31,622
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I hate anything that they call reality TV on MTV.

179
00:21:32,043 --> 00:21:36,047
[SPEAKER_01]: Because just, like, the crap that they were making them say was so ridiculous.

180
00:21:36,388 --> 00:21:40,372
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, where they ask them, like, you know... So, what would...

181
00:21:40,868 --> 00:21:42,389
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for watching!

182
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:02,243
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, do you think your son would mind if I gave him a pearl necklace?

183
00:22:02,703 --> 00:22:03,724
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's disgusting.

184
00:22:03,744 --> 00:22:05,245
[SPEAKER_01]: Why would you say that to somebody's mother?

185
00:22:05,405 --> 00:22:10,770
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's like, well, I don't know if he looks good in pearls, but, uh, it was just, like, completely retarded.

186
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:11,731
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, come on.

187
00:22:12,571 --> 00:22:19,077
[SPEAKER_01]: There was this other guy who wanted to sniff, like, the mother's, like, armpits because he had this, like, smell fetish thing.

188
00:22:19,177 --> 00:22:19,357
[SPEAKER_05]: Ew.

189
00:22:20,098 --> 00:22:21,759
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the crap that's on TV.

190
00:22:22,019 --> 00:22:22,920
[SPEAKER_02]: I did like this.

191
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,660
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what, though?

192
00:22:23,781 --> 00:22:26,543
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a very, very famous clip that comes from Date My Mom.

193
00:22:27,631 --> 00:22:29,612
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Harry Potter with a vagina!

194
00:22:30,113 --> 00:22:30,813
[SPEAKER_00]: I love her!

195
00:22:30,853 --> 00:22:31,934
[SPEAKER_01]: That was from Date My Mom.

196
00:22:32,614 --> 00:22:34,355
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's retarded stuff.

197
00:22:35,816 --> 00:22:38,318
[SPEAKER_01]: I did like the soup in their Curious George.

198
00:22:39,338 --> 00:22:40,539
[SPEAKER_01]: That was great.

199
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:45,282
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, they put George W. Bush in instead.

200
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:45,963
[SPEAKER_02]: That was pretty funny.

201
00:22:46,703 --> 00:22:47,564
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the soup's pretty good.

202
00:22:47,604 --> 00:22:49,925
[SPEAKER_02]: That soup's probably my favorite show on TV.

203
00:22:49,985 --> 00:22:51,106
[SPEAKER_02]: What I like about it is that

204
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:52,490
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

205
00:23:16,138 --> 00:23:16,618
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

206
00:23:38,513 --> 00:23:39,754
[SPEAKER_02]: Ultraviolate.

207
00:23:42,375 --> 00:23:45,277
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie can appreciate this one because she's a grammar Nazi there.

208
00:23:45,637 --> 00:23:46,758
[SPEAKER_02]: Ultraviolate.

209
00:23:46,818 --> 00:23:48,899
[SPEAKER_02]: The movie is supposed to be ultraviolet, right?

210
00:23:49,499 --> 00:23:50,900
[SPEAKER_02]: They put ultraviolate.

211
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:54,242
[SPEAKER_00]: There should be a movie called Ultraviolate.

212
00:23:54,262 --> 00:23:55,142
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a porno.

213
00:23:55,522 --> 00:23:58,944
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry that I poked you in your live journal, by the way, speaking of grammar.

214
00:23:58,964 --> 00:23:59,525
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all right.

215
00:23:59,565 --> 00:24:00,585
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know what I did.

216
00:24:00,625 --> 00:24:03,026
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you used I as a subject.

217
00:24:03,867 --> 00:24:05,548
[SPEAKER_02]: I gave you a collective eye roll.

218
00:24:06,275 --> 00:24:09,196
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you used I as a subject.

219
00:24:09,436 --> 00:24:09,716
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, whatever.

220
00:24:09,736 --> 00:24:11,836
[SPEAKER_00]: When you said me and I. Did I really?

221
00:24:11,856 --> 00:24:12,817
[SPEAKER_00]: No, him and I. Oh.

222
00:24:12,857 --> 00:24:13,717
[SPEAKER_00]: You used it as a subject.

223
00:24:13,737 --> 00:24:14,517
[SPEAKER_00]: It should have been him and me.

224
00:24:14,537 --> 00:24:15,057
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh.

225
00:24:15,597 --> 00:24:16,057
[SPEAKER_02]: My bad.

226
00:24:16,838 --> 00:24:18,758
[SPEAKER_00]: Jamie's grammar lesson of the night.

227
00:24:18,798 --> 00:24:19,738
[SPEAKER_02]: Grammar tip of the week.

228
00:24:20,118 --> 00:24:23,819
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what you need on the podcast because you got rid of it.

229
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:24,599
[SPEAKER_00]: Grammar tip of the week.

230
00:24:24,639 --> 00:24:24,860
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

231
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:29,001
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got to get rid of the website and get your grammar tip of the week instead.

232
00:24:29,041 --> 00:24:29,861
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll have to think about that.

233
00:24:30,221 --> 00:24:30,561
[SPEAKER_00]: Rock.

234
00:24:30,621 --> 00:24:32,461
[SPEAKER_02]: If we do go on a little break here, maybe that can be something.

235
00:24:32,481 --> 00:24:34,982
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, an apostrophe does not make it plural.

236
00:24:36,431 --> 00:24:40,013
[SPEAKER_02]: That is very useful for kids that write on web forums and stuff.

237
00:24:40,593 --> 00:24:41,894
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to look into this.

238
00:24:42,234 --> 00:24:44,775
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we have something developing here.

239
00:24:44,795 --> 00:24:46,116
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

240
00:24:46,576 --> 00:24:47,457
[SPEAKER_02]: Or I could do it.

241
00:24:47,557 --> 00:24:50,498
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be ironic if I did it because I have the worst grammar in the world.

242
00:24:51,339 --> 00:24:52,219
[SPEAKER_00]: I've read your email.

243
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,181
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but I write fast.

244
00:24:55,221 --> 00:24:56,161
[SPEAKER_05]: You write good.

245
00:24:57,482 --> 00:25:04,125
[SPEAKER_02]: I write good at work because I'll take time to spell check and grammar check and all that good stuff, but when I'm writing informally as I do in my live journal, I don't bother.

246
00:25:04,926 --> 00:25:05,426
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, whatever.

247
00:25:06,681 --> 00:25:14,788
[SPEAKER_02]: Alrighty, um, by the way, big thank you to, uh, Bugged, who, uh, I think was the one that pointed that out, um, and made, um, my buddy Jason take a picture of that, so.

248
00:25:16,329 --> 00:25:20,613
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, let's see, oh, yeah, somebody in chatroom says, Skyrite good.

249
00:25:23,295 --> 00:25:25,056
[SPEAKER_02]: I gotta tally up cage match votes here.

250
00:25:25,116 --> 00:25:27,098
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody's gotta talk about a completely different subject.

251
00:25:27,298 --> 00:25:30,301
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, do you have any, uh, podcast articles that didn't make the cut tonight?

252
00:25:31,122 --> 00:25:32,643
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, maybe?

253
00:25:33,023 --> 00:25:33,443
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

254
00:25:33,463 --> 00:25:33,924
[SPEAKER_01]: Um,

255
00:25:35,532 --> 00:25:35,692
[SPEAKER_01]: DJ Maxx

256
00:26:05,768 --> 00:26:07,409
[SPEAKER_01]: and Exit for the PSP.

257
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:10,431
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Ground Day 3 is for the PS2.

258
00:26:12,193 --> 00:26:12,913
[SPEAKER_01]: What else was there?

259
00:26:13,594 --> 00:26:14,634
[SPEAKER_01]: There was some Yu-Gi-Oh!

260
00:26:14,654 --> 00:26:17,637
[SPEAKER_01]: 2 for 1 that was also coming out, but I don't play Yu-Gi-Oh!

261
00:26:17,657 --> 00:26:18,617
[SPEAKER_01]: so who cares?

262
00:26:19,238 --> 00:26:22,180
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, I don't know.

263
00:26:23,421 --> 00:26:33,648
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of good games coming out in March, including that really crappy game, Dance Factory, the one by Codemasters where you put any CD in and it'll make DDR steps for it.

264
00:26:33,788 --> 00:26:34,789
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm worried about this game.

265
00:26:35,703 --> 00:26:37,004
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it looks like crap.

266
00:26:38,184 --> 00:26:38,745
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure it is.

267
00:26:41,006 --> 00:26:44,288
[SPEAKER_01]: And... There's a new Monster Rancher game coming out.

268
00:26:44,568 --> 00:26:45,188
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yay!

269
00:26:45,649 --> 00:26:47,430
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, you know, we love those games.

270
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:50,872
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, um... I don't know.

271
00:26:51,292 --> 00:26:51,792
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to think.

272
00:26:52,432 --> 00:26:53,753
[SPEAKER_01]: Really good games coming out.

273
00:26:53,833 --> 00:26:54,754
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to fill time anymore.

274
00:26:54,774 --> 00:26:55,254
[SPEAKER_01]: Bust the move.

275
00:26:55,594 --> 00:26:56,155
[SPEAKER_01]: Bust the move.

276
00:26:56,375 --> 00:26:56,795
[SPEAKER_01]: What?

277
00:26:56,855 --> 00:26:57,115
[SPEAKER_01]: What?

278
00:26:57,295 --> 00:26:57,836
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

279
00:26:58,056 --> 00:26:58,856
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, never mind.

280
00:26:58,956 --> 00:27:01,698
[SPEAKER_02]: You got me excited for a minute here because I thought we were talking Kitty Yen.

281
00:27:02,378 --> 00:27:02,978
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

282
00:27:03,259 --> 00:27:03,499
[SPEAKER_02]: Bummer.

283
00:27:06,508 --> 00:27:06,828
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

284
00:27:07,309 --> 00:27:15,897
[SPEAKER_01]: I did also last night, you know, we had those brochures that were pretty cool of that Tango game.

285
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:17,138
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm-hmm.

286
00:27:17,927 --> 00:27:18,347
[SPEAKER_04]: Xtango?

287
00:27:18,527 --> 00:27:19,448
[SPEAKER_01]: Xtango, yeah.

288
00:27:19,808 --> 00:27:21,849
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, did that game ever freaking come out?

289
00:27:21,909 --> 00:27:22,089
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

290
00:27:22,509 --> 00:27:29,612
[SPEAKER_01]: But the brochures, they're made out of this, like, weird stuff that I tossed them in my fireplace, and they, like, burst into flames.

291
00:27:29,652 --> 00:27:34,673
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, they blew up, like, Jiffy Pop or something like that, and all of a sudden, boom!

292
00:27:34,693 --> 00:27:37,435
[SPEAKER_01]: There's, like, a huge fire coming out, like, woohoo!

293
00:27:40,556 --> 00:27:40,976
[SPEAKER_01]: Rad!

294
00:27:41,016 --> 00:27:43,537
[SPEAKER_01]: We were burning things last night and playing Scrabble, so that was...

295
00:27:44,447 --> 00:27:45,507
[SPEAKER_00]: Fire and Scrabble.

296
00:27:45,547 --> 00:27:47,468
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like the best way to spend an evening.

297
00:27:47,868 --> 00:27:48,408
[SPEAKER_02]: Then Clue.

298
00:27:48,568 --> 00:27:50,169
[SPEAKER_02]: You know how to fucking party, Loki.

299
00:27:50,409 --> 00:27:51,689
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way, I still have Rob's copy of Clue.

300
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:55,731
[SPEAKER_02]: God damn it, give it back because Jason hasn't seen it and needs to.

301
00:27:56,571 --> 00:27:57,671
[SPEAKER_02]: So at least I think he told me.

302
00:27:57,691 --> 00:27:59,072
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to watch Advent Children.

303
00:27:59,392 --> 00:27:59,612
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

304
00:27:59,632 --> 00:28:00,672
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to watch Advent Children.

305
00:28:01,933 --> 00:28:08,815
[SPEAKER_02]: As a follow-up to something we talked about, Loki got me a DVD of Advent Children so I could... Speaking of Advent Children, remember I posted the new date on their website.

306
00:28:08,895 --> 00:28:11,136
[SPEAKER_01]: It's coming out April 25th in the U.S.,

307
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,221
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

308
00:28:37,423 --> 00:28:43,765
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, for your next fire and scrabble night, Roz says, I heard that strawberry Pop-Tarts burst into flames.

309
00:28:44,545 --> 00:28:45,445
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't have Pop-Tarts.

310
00:28:45,485 --> 00:28:52,268
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't really burned, like, we just burn our junk mail and whatever paper we have in the house, usually.

311
00:28:52,668 --> 00:29:00,430
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been trying to push for burning the phone book, but for some reason, she doesn't want to burn the phone book.

312
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:02,951
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at all that fire.

313
00:29:04,022 --> 00:29:05,363
[SPEAKER_01]: Pre-flammable stuff.

314
00:29:05,383 --> 00:29:06,924
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's like the size of a log as it is.

315
00:29:07,004 --> 00:29:08,324
[SPEAKER_02]: That stuff would go up in flames too.

316
00:29:08,384 --> 00:29:11,146
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's reveal tonight's podcast winner.

317
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:12,567
[SPEAKER_02]: You know it was a... or podcast winner.

318
00:29:12,887 --> 00:29:13,868
[SPEAKER_02]: Cage match winner.

319
00:29:13,888 --> 00:29:15,128
[SPEAKER_02]: I have something else on my brain.

320
00:29:15,789 --> 00:29:16,549
[SPEAKER_02]: Tonight's cage match winner.

321
00:29:17,069 --> 00:29:27,415
[SPEAKER_02]: Very interesting cage match winner situation tonight because we had two songs tied, but one song got one more vote than those two songs.

322
00:29:27,735 --> 00:29:30,237
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was an incredibly close match tonight.

323
00:29:30,597 --> 00:29:32,178
[SPEAKER_02]: So all songs did very well.

324
00:29:32,571 --> 00:29:33,732
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

325
00:29:55,123 --> 00:30:00,326
[SPEAKER_02]: Just goes to show that it doesn't matter what we think, ultimately the chatroom can do whatever the fuck they want.

326
00:30:00,366 --> 00:30:01,426
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they're just fucking with us.

327
00:30:01,666 --> 00:30:03,787
[SPEAKER_02]: That was our punishment for you doing that, Loki.

328
00:30:03,887 --> 00:30:04,588
[SPEAKER_02]: Good job.

329
00:30:04,888 --> 00:30:06,008
[SPEAKER_02]: Way to ruin it, Loki.

330
00:30:06,849 --> 00:30:07,589
[SPEAKER_01]: Dick.

331
00:30:07,609 --> 00:30:12,172
[SPEAKER_02]: And since Jamie and I won't be here next week, that song by default wins two weeks in a row.

332
00:30:12,532 --> 00:30:13,292
[SPEAKER_02]: Good job.

333
00:30:14,072 --> 00:30:16,814
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, way you lose at the internet.

334
00:30:16,834 --> 00:30:17,214
[SPEAKER_00]: Kill him.

335
00:30:18,054 --> 00:30:18,975
[SPEAKER_02]: This show is over.

336
00:30:19,035 --> 00:30:20,436
[SPEAKER_00]: This show is over.

337
00:30:21,436 --> 00:30:21,896
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kidding.

338
00:30:22,257 --> 00:30:22,917
[SPEAKER_02]: Final thoughts.

339
00:30:25,045 --> 00:30:26,766
[SPEAKER_01]: The extra final thoughts, Loki.

340
00:30:28,006 --> 00:30:36,609
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to freaking get out of this goddamn writer's block for my music stuff, because I need to make a song by the March deadline.

341
00:30:37,729 --> 00:30:38,650
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, your final thoughts.

342
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:39,770
[SPEAKER_00]: I like mummies.

343
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:43,271
[SPEAKER_00]: I plugged in mummified cats, remember?

344
00:30:44,491 --> 00:30:50,813
[SPEAKER_00]: Mummified cats are cool, because when they have their wrappings, they actually stitch little ears onto their wrappings.

345
00:30:51,194 --> 00:30:51,694
[SPEAKER_00]: It was cute.

346
00:30:52,134 --> 00:30:52,454
[SPEAKER_02]: Dorky.

347
00:30:53,307 --> 00:30:57,631
[SPEAKER_02]: My final thought is bye, and I'll see you on March 5th.

348
00:30:57,731 --> 00:30:57,911
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.

349
00:30:57,951 --> 00:30:59,312
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to miss you guys.

350
00:30:59,332 --> 00:31:00,993
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to miss you.

351
00:31:01,053 --> 00:31:02,934
[SPEAKER_02]: I miss you already, Rob, but my aim's improving.

352
00:31:02,974 --> 00:31:03,275
[SPEAKER_02]: Shut up.

353
00:31:03,615 --> 00:31:05,256
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll see some of our listeners at Katsukon, though.

354
00:31:05,336 --> 00:31:06,077
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to be exciting.

355
00:31:06,397 --> 00:31:09,960
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have to make flyers for Katsukon because I said I would at some point, so we'll do that.

356
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,120
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, that's it.

357
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:13,042
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's your fortune cookie message for the day.

358
00:31:16,193 --> 00:31:17,854
[SPEAKER_04]: You're tuned into Orange Lounge Radio.

359
00:31:17,874 --> 00:31:21,617
[SPEAKER_04]: Radio dedicated to video games and what gamers really want to know.
