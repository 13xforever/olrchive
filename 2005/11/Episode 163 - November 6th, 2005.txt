I can't get enough!
Thank you for watching.
Thanks for watching!
The following live program is a special presentation of Orange Lounge Radio.
The following program is intended for mature audiences.
On tonight's program of Orange Lounge Radio... Rob, the fuck's up?
Shut up.
I just... This microphone is so weird, I can't stand it.
Anyway... Anyway... This microphone is heavy and I can club baby seals with it.
Can I do the introduction, please?
Oh, okay.
This should be a clue of what to expect on tonight's program.
On tonight's program, we are going to make sweet, sweet love to Red Octane and Harmonix.
And we're not even going to charge them.
We'll be back after this.
Orange Lounge Radio is presented in the TMI sound format.
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio Live.
This morning's talk radio is so much more.
Oh, God.
Call me Daddy.
Orange Lounge may contain adult content.
Orange Lounge may contain many four-letter words.
Orange Lounge may contain a scene of puberty.
Orange Lounge may contain plenty of... Buh, uh, buh, uh, buh, cocky.
Just kidding.
Orange Lounge Radio will not contain any of that in this episode.
Well, isn't that special?
Orange Lounge Radio Live is a fully interactive program via our website at www.orangeloungeradio.com And now, here are your hosts for Orange Lounge Radio Live, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.
We are live!
This is episode number 163 for this November the 6th of 2005.
You're tuned in to Orange Lounge Radio, radio that gamers really want, and this is Orange Lounge Radio Live, your home for all the news and discussion on rhythm and music games, as well as the gamer community and the pop culture world.
We're plugged in and fully interactive through our website at www.orangeloungeradio.com.
My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky.
Joining me, as always, are my awesome co-hosts.
In this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm, Miss DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
Yo.
How you doing?
This microphone is heavy.
I also drink the blood of young virgins.
Hot.
I'm having it for dinner right now.
It's salad dressing.
Awesome.
At least that's what I think that they use in their salad dressings at McDonald's.
It has to be something that tastes fairly...
We may have to switch mics, because for some reason that one's not picking you up so well.
Let's do this.
Just make sure when you're talking, the little switch is out this way, otherwise it won't pick you up.
This is my microphone.
I know, but I switched it because we had trouble.
Don't change things on me!
It makes me anxious.
And when I get anxious, people die.
They're all going to get you.
Huh?
Oh.
Hi, Loki.
Thank you for joining our program tonight.
We appreciate it.
Thank you.
Glad to be here.
Fucking RARC work!
Something is wrong with my microphone.
Like, I'm not as loud as I usually am.
Thank God.
Check, check, check, check.
There we go.
There we go.
Now I can hear myself.
This internet sucks.
It really does.
All right.
Anyway, now that we've got our sound issues worked out, we can actually have ourselves a little bit of a show tonight.
I know I want to talk a lot about Guitar Hero because it's really cool.
and we're also going to talk about, of course, our weeks and our day.
We're going to talk about a cool interview that we're going to have on tonight's podcast and then we're going to talk about whatever tickles our fancy.
And then we're going to set a guitar on fire.
We just might.
But first, say hello to our special guests because it wouldn't be a show if we didn't have some special guests.
Say hello to Bugged.
Hello to Bugged.
And also say hello to DDR Angel.
Hello.
My salad just exploded.
That sounds hot.
You don't want to know.
Alright, and Xtifer's around as well.
He might pop in a little later in the show, hopefully to give us a movie review.
He's fondling his new Mac.
Yes, he's making sweet love to his new Macintosh.
And I'm going to get one soon, too.
Another.
Another.
Alright.
We'll be back after this quick introduction to talk about us.
and what's going on in the video game world.
We'll be back.
I figured we could maybe continue the theme of the pre-show tonight because the pre-show tonight was a lot of disco music.
So we're going to continue on and get down.
I just needed to culture everybody because the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack is fabulous.
It is great.
So let's get down right now.
More Bee Gees.
More Cowbell.
More Orange Lounge Radio.
We'll be back after this.
Join us and chat.

In the swing, you gotta kick the thing, I like this, tell me what you gonna do, we're gonna play with you, now how you gonna swing?
Hello?
Hello?
Is this thing on?
Testing.
Testing 1, 2.
I'm looking in the index, but I don't see anything.
How to run a radio show.
Hello?
I don't understand this.
Does this thing work?
This thing reads like stereo instructions.
Is this on?
What the hell?
Orange Lounge Radio.
Broke Down Ghetto Bomani Radio.
Hi kids, we're back here on Orange Lounge Radio, and I know we've been having some mic problems tonight or something, so we tried fixing it a little bit during the break, so I hope that our mic quality is a little better now.
But if not, you'll just have to deal with it, I guess.
I don't know.
We tried to patch some things up.
We kicked Mike out and replaced him.
Yeah, that's right.
We fired.
FIRED!
So hopefully things are a little better now.
We would like you to know that those responsible have just been sacked.
And those who did the sacking have also been sacked.
At Infinium.
As suddenly a giant foot comes crashing down on our program.
We will now continue the rest of this program in a flashy manner and at great expense.
I hate you guys.
Anyway.
That's why they haven't kicked us out, right?
Yeah.
Moving on, I want to get into this real quickly because we were talking about this a little bit during the break before we get into a little bit of How's Your Week, How's Your Day.
But Loki's randomly surfing the internet as he does when he's on this program because he doesn't really like to participate in the program.
He just surfs the internet randomly and giggles once in a while in the corner.
So, Loki, what was this article you found about the AOL guy?
You found an article about the AOL guy?
Yeah, the AOL guy is now, he's basically selling himself to make,
You know, custom WAV files for your email programs or what have you.
Um, and he's charging, I believe, was it like $12 for, um, per WAV file or something like that.
Let me see here.
I can't remember.
He's already sold himself to the devil.
He may as well sell himself to everybody else.
Um, he was... Can you get him to say anything?
Well, I have no idea.
Like, could I make him record a WAV file and send it to my ex that goes, You've got herpes!
It says, let's see here, yeah, one WAV file, it would be $12 for a non-AOL file, $30 for five files, so that's a little break there.
It says, basically, it doesn't really say what else he'll do, just pretty much whatever, I guess, you want.
Is there a limit to the number of words he'll say?
I don't know, it doesn't say, um, so, I guess if you're gonna order... I don't mind if I'm singing, I'm a little teapot.
I'm a little teapot, shorthand stout.
You've got mail, you've got hot tea.
Anyway.
I think he'll do, like, you've got mail and stuff, like, he'll do, like, um, you know, you've got mail, Bob, or you've got mail...
You've got served.
EXERCIEXECON or something.
You just make it up and when he doesn't say it right, you go, no you bastard, that's not my name.
Emphasis on the X. Some ancient Egyptian name.
Or like my... Awesome.
So, yeah.
Make him pronounce something in Welsh, he'll totally screw it up.
In a foreign language.
Can you imagine what it must be like as him, you know, it's just...
It's just really bad stuff.
I mean, you know, he's all making love to his wife.
Oh, yeah.
Just really weird.
He's got a weird voice.
I'm saying that.
I only get hot when you say it.
You've got mail.
It's like, remember, it was Carlos, not Carlos Mencia, but Paulo Francisco and the movie guy, the movie voice guy, and him, you know.
Oh, yeah, that's an old, yeah.
The passion.
Anyways.
DarkSakura
I'm not even a well-put-together basket.
It was sort of like a mildewed basket like you find in the thrift store.
Ew.
Yeah.
I went to the doctor Tuesday with a migraine.
And so now I found out that my brain might be broken.
So I get to go in for a CT scan on Monday.
Fun, huh?
I don't want to make a joke.
But I have to say this, it's not the tumor.
I've been doing, I eat, you, I eat fat in the car.
The only time my headache wasn't present was when I was really drunk.
I don't want to come across as insensitive to the listeners, so.
I have the diagnosis.
You're allergic to sobriety.
That's probably it.
I know, I'm so smart.
That'll be $50, please.
Guess what?
Bite me.
Biller Insurance I'll tell you, Bill, that I can't say it on the air.
I played Guitar Hero and lots of it.
You're going to have to drink the thing that tastes like chalk?
I don't know.
Because they're testing my brain.
It'll be fine.
You'll be fine.
I have a headache right now, too.
I have the same headache that I have had since Friday the week before.
So, I'm not very happy, and they put me on stuff for migraines.
They should put a couple pills underneath her head, so, you know, this is your brain, this is your brain on drugs.
Hehe.
This doesn't even make sense.
Her brain is on drugs, therefore when she's getting whatever, you know, cat scan or whatever.
Oh, okay, I got it, the egg, okay.
I have a magnet that says, this is your brain.
and then this is your brain with a piece of toast and bacon.
I haven't gotten, you know, a little known fact, I actually collect fridge magnets.
Magnet House
I love that store.
It's awesome.
Magnets are cool.
The bumper stickers of my fridge.
Back to my broken brain.
Oh, sorry.
Oh, sorry.
I think that our listeners are probably very amused that they found out what I was actually on.
They keep saying Vicodin.
I'm not on Vicodin.
I'm on something else that I'm not going to tell you what I'm on.
But they would laugh.
Because it's the last thing anyone ever expected me to be taken.
Like Prozac?
Actually.
I don't know.
I don't know.
It's actually called triple whiskey shots.
Awesome.
At least I wish that they had triple whiskey shots in the pill so you don't get the burn.
You just take the whiskey pill.
Okay.
Well, I hope you go to the doctor and everything is okay and they just find that they need to let the hamster out or something.
I don't know.
Dude, if they gave me morphine, I'd be freaking happy.
All right.
Anything else you want to share about your week and your day?
I need a new job.
Okay, now hiring.
Loki, how was your week?
How was your day?
My week was pretty good.
The entire week was basically filled with...
Work and playing deathmatches in Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories, because my boss loves Grand Theft Auto, and so now, instead of taking a 15 minute break and playing something, we go down into the theater and play a four player multiplayer deathmatch on Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories and take a half an hour break, and it's okay because the boss is there too, so, hell yeah.
Do that twice a day.
So,
That's pretty fun.
As promised, I have made sure to participate in the Biggest Loser thing, and I'm happy to say that I have eaten fast food every single day this week to meet my Quora.
And yeah, other than that, really not too much else.
You've got heart problems!
I'm fine.
Shit.
I went and saw Saw 2 last night.
I have to say, though, I was quite disappointed.
It wasn't as gory as I thought it would be.
It really was a letdown.
I mean, I don't know what everyone is saying.
I was expecting, like, you know, fountains of blood.
There is not even nearly enough blood in that, or gore, or anything.
So, they really are going to have to impress me with Saw 3.
And you know there's going to be a Saw 3.
Oh, yeah.
Stupid bitch.
They shouldn't have given the main guy cancer or it should have been cancer who doesn't progress that fast or something like that, you know, magic cancer or something.
I don't know.
Try not to give away all the plot points of the movie in case some folks want to see it.
He has cancer!
Cancer!
Yeah, whatever.
Alright, anything else you want to share?
No, really, no.
Okay.
Alright, Angel, how was your week, how was your day?
Good.
Hang on.
Chew the salad and swallow it.
I mean, I'm just kidding.
I'm very proud of Angel today.
What?
For eating a salad.
Well, yeah.
I'm very proud.
See, we may have just said that X-Fur had to do it, but he's on because I'm actually following the rules, so we'll see how far this goes.
I've been pretty good.
Now, I didn't agree to the no fast food thing, but I've only had fast food twice this week, because I realized I did have it once today and once after last week's show.
So I've been averaging only once a week, so that's not bad.
And when I go, I don't supersize anything or whatever, and I got a decent sandwich.
So I think I'm doing okay.
It's better than my usual three or four times a week, so I'm good.
Well, for me, I didn't really know where the guidelines went for me.
I just kind of grabbed the mic last week and I was like, uh, is that me not going to do it too?
And you guys just kind of gave me that look and I'm like, uh.
What was the candy that broke you?
Um, I think... Probably Candy Corn!
That stuff's evil!
Actually, no, it was like the little tiny square piece of, um, Snickers or something.
Oh, one's not gonna kill ya.
I mean, one's okay.
It's just that you can't have one five times a day.
And, like, a little tiny vanilla Tootsie Roll.
They're so good.
Everybody was allowed to cheat on Halloween, right?
Yeah, but I just kind of started anyway.
I was like, eh, whatever.
I'm going to have to get used to it.
All is good.
When's our next weigh-in?
When are we going to do a weigh-in and check on the progress?
After the show.
Oh, crap.
Wait, did I just say yay?
How about we do it in the last take?
Okay, we can do that.
I have everything written down, but only you can see.
But I've got to actually make up the chart for everybody.
Sounds good.
I look forward to you later in the show.
Oh, you remember that little thing I kind of announced last week, like, oh boy, let's hope I get it or whatever, and I got word back, and I opened my email on Thursday at, what time was it, probably about 6.30.
Congratulations, you're a member of the member advisory board, which is that little council I was talking about last week.
So what exactly will you be doing as part of that?
Uh, six month term working closely with staff to advise on the community and blah, you know, pretty much NDA stuff, so, cool.
Okay, very cool.
All right, let's see.
My week and my day.
I just had a long week.
I did a lot, a lot of work this week.
It's been a very exhausting week, but good.
I mean, in a good way.
I like my job and stuff, so it's cool.
Went out Friday night with the one and only DarkSakura.
That was pretty cool because we went out to one of the local bars and we just kind of sat around.
We chilled.
I drank a lot.
DarkSakura.com
Thank you for watching!
No, he thought you were cool.
And then, you know, that night, actually, this would be Friday night, we were watching Elimidate at my friend's house.
Not Jamie.
Jamie was at home in bed by this point.
But we were watching Elimidate and on the TV came a commercial.
and it's the commercial featuring our very own Dark Sakura and Loki for the Guitar Hero story that's going to be on TV on Tuesday and it's awesome.
And it was just cool to see that during Elimidate because I know that's like one of Loki's favorite shows.
I thought Elimidate and Blind Date because they're on back to back.
I know you guys watch Blind Date.
It was on during both shows actually.
So, whatever.
Anyway, we actually have that story.
So we're going to, or not the story, but we have a little promo.
I just want to play it for our listeners here.
So they can hear DarkSakura's quote that will be in the news story, because it's pretty funny.
So let's see here if we can get this to play.
It's a little bit of movie time here on Orange Lounge Radio.
Loading, loading, loading.
Come on.
Here we go.
Tuesday on WB58 News at 10.
It feels like playing an actual guitar.
Get the rush of rocking out for an audience right in your own living room.
I love the remote, so I play that when it beats the dated.
There's a fun new way to make your musical dreams a reality.
You're actually creating music and playing in front of a crowd.
Find out why this rocking new game could be a big hit this holiday season.
People of all ages are really getting into this.
Tuesday on WB58 News at 10.
I love how in that promo there's like one shot of Loki for like two, not even a second.
There's just like a shot of Loki going on the guitar and that's it.
It was the equivalent of Loki's foot basically being in the new story.
So it's great.
And what else is new?
I guess the distance had the neat thing where I nodded my head.
And I think that's cool that DarkSakura is talking about the Ramones.
That kind of amused me when I saw that on TV.
So...
Anyway, we posted a link to that on the website.
Of course, Tuesday night is when the story is going to air, and we will hopefully have something.
I'm thinking the news stations, because it looks like they put a lot of their news stories on the website, so I'm thinking the news station might actually put it on their website, which would certainly make it easier for us to share it with all of you.
Because if they put the promo up there, they'll put the story up there, and then hopefully we'll have so much fun.
2.0.
So excited.
I hope.
You know, I'm guessing they're not even going to let me say anything.
I'll just be the guy in the background.
So what do you think about this game?
And then it'll just cut away.
You know what's great is my ignition pad is over there, and it's in the background of one of the shots, so my ignition pad got more screen time than yours did.
My Konami guitars are out, because we've been playing guitar for years before.
Right on.
And the Gemania set was out.
Awesome.
So, anyway, let's talk about Guitar Hero a little bit, because I finally managed to pick up the game this week.
I picked up Guitar Hero, and I've been playing the shit out of it since yesterday when I got it.
It's...
Really great.
I was really surprised considering that the last game Red Octane put out I wasn't too impressed with.
This one, being done by Harmonix, is so wonderful and it really makes me hopeful for whatever Red Octane is going to do in the future.
Maybe going to some other types of music.
I think the music game community is going to win big if this game does well.
And a lot of early reviews for this game...
have great scores.
I think GameSpot gave it a great review.
I know 1up.com gave it a perfect 10.
That's higher than a lot of DDR games get.
I think what people are really liking about the game is that it's very accessible.
It is.
It's a fun game.
My friend came over yesterday for Stargate Marathon, and I was playing a game while she was making pancakes.
Awesome.
Holy pancakes, they were yummy.
And I was playing just a couple of stuff, and she was like, oh my god, they got their original songs.
I was like, no.
No, the cover songs were that good, but the covers were really good.
They went to a great length to duplicate the effects.
Yeah, they did.
I mean, some of them, like the Franz Ferdinand song that I kind of like, it's in their sounds, just like the original.
And, like, Iron Man sounds great.
Some of them aren't exact, but they're close enough.
They're closer than any karaoke revolution, I think it's been.
I was freaking playing Thundercats 65.
That was cool.
Yeah, it's awesome.
It's got a great song.
My only kind of boo-hoo part is that there's not more songs playable at the very start, because yesterday, you know, I had some people over.
We were wanting to play Guitar Freaks, or Guitar Freaks, Guitar Hero.
Whoops.
Where's Freebird?
The thing said no Freebird!
I want Freebird!
They need to have Freebird in the sequel.
No Freebird and no Stairway to Heaven!
They need Freebird, and they need Stairway, and they need... Blur.
I was gonna say Sweet Home Alabama, but I guess we already have... Blur.
Sure, we can have Blur.
Metallica?
Like old Metallica, not new sellout Metallica?
Metallica...
I want to get some really hard rock stuff in here, like, you know, I'm going to get some metal, like, even get some filter in there, you know, some of that stuff.
Even, you know, even though they've kind of dissolved as a band, Gravity Kills would be fucking awesome, because they just had really good guitar sections in the whole stuff.
Same, that and Rammstein.
Rammstein had tons of really good guitar sections in their songs.
We need Guns N' Roses.
Yeah.
Yes.
We need, no, we need Welcome to the Jungle, I'm sorry.
Welcome!
I hope they link up to a later game I hope they decide to do a drum game I mean I guess that would be too similar but maybe hook up well I guess they can't even hook up to Karaoke Revolution because it's another company but somehow hook up to another you know what Red Octane should revive is keyboard games they should launch a keyboard game that would be badass expensive but fun Van Halen would be awesome too
DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
What else I wanted to say about Guitar Hero though, you know my favorite thing about Guitar Hero is the art direction.
The art and like the sets and the little like, just there's little jokes that make the cold game, like when you're loading and going to a new stage it shows it turning up to 11.
The female guitarist with the short black and red hair was actually modeled off of a real person.
Really?
Aren't they all supposed to be modeled off real people?
Well, I know there's like the Keith Richards clone that I just sort of freaked out over because the first time I saw him pop up was with a flying V. I was like, it's Murdoch!
Yeah.
Nerd moment!
And, yeah, I just, the art direction in the game isn't, like the little pictures drawn on the notebook, like they even have a unicorn drawn on the notebook, which made me think of, anyway, I forget it.
But the art direction in the game is great.
And there's just all these, I like the way it's set up.
Like, it's different than a Bomani game.
It does make me motion sick.
Really?
Why is that?
Just the ISO perspective thing?
Yeah.
And the way it's moving?
That's too bad.
Music is not MIDI!
Mass Riot Breaks Out
and then it shows the bill with your managers cut and the food cut and the bribery cuts and all that stuff leaving you with so much money like all that little stuff goes a long way in amusing me greatly and that's important to amuse me greatly so the way the game is presented it's not the same even as like amplitude and frequency because amplitude and frequency is almost walk up, play your songs, walk away the way the Guitar Hero is set up is cool and is what
Part of what makes that game so great and stand out so much differently than Guitar Freaks.
Honestly, Guitar Heroes and Guitar Freaks are very different games.
Yes, they both use guitar controllers, but you've got Guitar Hero has five buttons, which changes things completely.
And the whammy bar!
And the whammy bar!
Absolutely.
I was wailing hard, okay?
The way you turn your guitar up, the wailing thing, like in Guitar Freaks it was called a wailing bonus, it's done...
One thing I do sort of miss though that was in Guitar Freaks were the hidden notes.
Where if you, you know, manage to find the hidden notes, it would just pop up a whole new set of notes.
Or the open picks.
Yeah.
But still, I mean, Guitar Hero has... She gets freestyle points.
I got mine right when the shipment arrived at our GameStop.
Right.
Loki?
I was going to mention that the game's not even supposed to be out yet, but... Technically, but... Actually, I'm going to go ahead and say officially it had no street date on any of their shipped packages, therefore it could be released ASAP.
Well, yeah, I mean, games don't really have street dates, but the whole thing was they were not supposed to be shipping until Tuesday anyway, so a lot of this stuff's early.
I think it was kind of one of those things, like, they did it in the groove the very same way.
Like, it didn't really have an official release date.
It was just, you know, we're going to ship it out whenever you get it.
We got it pressed faster than we thought we would, so here you go.
Yeah, so that's cool.
I mean, so it's out there now if you guys want to look around.
But probably Tuesday, Wednesday is when you're really going to start seeing this game out there just about everywhere.
And I think it has the potential to do very well.
I thought it was interesting.
And I remember bringing this up on the show before about the MTV partnership with the game.
But I kind of forgot about it until I booted up the game and saw the MTV logo.
And even though MTV kind of sucks, I think the partnership is going to be great exposure for the game.
and what's really cool about the game is that all the unlocked songs are unsigned bands with a real song, like the people that won the Be a Guitar Hero contest and you know, littler bands, I guess I shouldn't say unsigned, but more littler, not so heard of bands.
The only band in there I'd really heard of before was Freeze Pop, because they have a song there that you unlock and it's badass.
I love the Freeze Pop song.
Get ready to rock.
It's great.
So anyway, I definitely give a glowing review to Guitar Hero.
I think it's fabulous, and you all should go buy it if you want to play a guitar game.
The price tag's a little bit high, so maybe they'll come down in price after Christmas, and maybe it would be a better time to get it.
But it's great.
It's so much fun.
Any other thoughts on Guitar Hero?
We'll talk a little... Oh, Angel.
I like how the notes at the bottom of the screen, like the colors...
For the notes, because it obviously goes with the buttons, but, you know, they're bright on the screen, so for me, it'll be easier to play, since I am color and shape oriented.
Well, you guys knew that, but, um, yeah, so, it'll be easier for me to play, and for those that have difficulty like I do, well, it'll be a good thing, so I can't wait to pick it up!
Ah!
Alright, sounds good.
Yeah, it's very bright and all the colors stand out.
It's very nice.
Very nice.
Basically, the way it's set up, just imagine it's frequency or amplitude, except you don't move around the tube.
It's just the ISO view of the notes coming at you.
Which sometimes can be a little bit bothersome, though, because you can't see the notes as far in advance.
And for me, I'm really big on noticing the measures.
Like in Guitar Freaks, you can see the little lines that show you the measures.
But in Guitar Hero, it's harder to see those lines and judge because it's at an ISO perspective.
So it's kind of, I don't know, it's kind of tricky.
But those are really minor, minor complaints.
I would hope that in a later version you could maybe change that, like tilt the perspective to something that works better for me.
Like that would be great if you could freely rotate the perspective.
I'm sure it's possible.
But that's a very minor complaint in the scope of things, honestly.
It's a great first release.
A lot of promising things.
Kick-ass song list.
I love it.
It's great.
D.R.
Mario Mix Guitar Hero
I think I'm playing Smoke on the Water My hand was about to fall off This song's long, it's like 7 minutes
Alright, we'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.
I guess we'll start off this break with a little bit of, we'll start off with a classic Guitar Freaks tune.
We'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.
It's great, man!
Thank you for watching!
Orange Lounge Radio.
We put your thing down, flip it, and reverse it.
I'm trekking on along here after that Guitar Freaks break.
We were checking out during the break some folks in our chat room posted that some websites out there have leaked some new Beatmania screenshots.
Screens from the brand new Beatmania game and I totally missed this.
I guess these were actually released earlier in the week.
But very interesting, some of these screenshots.
Maybe I missed this before if this was previously announced, but I noticed one of these screens shows the free scratching zone.
DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
How often do they use them in songs?
Not very.
I swear, the five key game I probably played the most of was Beatmania 6 mix and core, that release, and I don't remember seeing this in there.
There was like a couple songs, a handful.
Maybe that was just on crack, I don't know.
Very interesting purpley interface there, and also, by the way, which shows that V is in the game, but that shouldn't be a big shock to anybody, that V is going to turn up in Beatmania USA.
Why not?
It's been like every other... Every Japanese release since 5th.
Every single one.
Did you know that TenStyle is only like a few days away?
It's not that far.
I think TenStyle is like 10 days away, somebody was telling me.
Crazy.
So BeatMini is very purple.
It's a very different interface.
I can appreciate that they're doing something new with it, not just, you know, cloning a Japanese release and taking out some songs and putting in different ones.
It makes the game feel very much like ours, even if you don't care for purple or don't really care for the interface, at least it's something a little different.
Hey, L.O.G. ?
Thanks for watching!
All right, I think what we'll do now before we get to list list because I don't think everyone's quite ready to go yet.
I think what maybe we'll do is we'll go to the Skype line and take some telephone calls on the Skype line, www.orangeloungeradio.com and click on interact with us if you would like to get more information about how you can call the program.
You can either use your computer using a program called Skype, or you can actually use our brand new phone number, which I don't remember off the top of my head, but it's posted on the website.
But the phone's already ringing.
I don't need to give out that phone number.
We're going to go right to a call.
So, hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Hey Siggy, how you doing?
I'm a little bit anticipated right now.
You're what?
A little bit anticipated.
Anticipated?
Why's that?
Because 10 days left.
Beatmania 2DX, TenStyle, CS.
That's right.
You were telling me about this before the show, that we don't have much longer to go before TenStyle's going to be out.
That's awesome.
Yeah, well, I got a little news about Ten Style CS for those who haven't caught up with it yet.
Oh yeah?
What's that?
Two Happy Sky songs have been confirmed for Ten Style CS.
What's that?
That's Lesson 5 and Under the Sky.
Awesome.
So we don't just get one, we get two Happy Sky songs.
That's good news.
So far, there have been 24 unconfirmed songs yet.
Really?
Probably until this Thursday, we won't be seeing, you know, Konami's going to reveal the entire complete song list.
Hopefully by this Thursday.
Oh yeah, seeing as the games come out very soon.
All those songs, of course, being done by LED.
It's all V. It's all remixes of V. Speaking of V, yeah, V has been confirmed for Beatmania US.
Not a big surprise, though, honestly.
Nah, not a big surprise to me either.
So, in fact, if V hadn't have been there, you know people would have complained.
Where's V?
Why didn't they put V in there?
Konami hates us.
Konami hates America.
Konami USA sucks.
Why didn't they put my fucking V in there?
You know that's how it would have been.
Yeah.
Talking about other stuff, well, you haven't premiered the Matsumoto Goliath's bonus track yet, right?
No, I keep meaning to, and I always forget to play it, but it's a great song.
I love the video.
The video's very cool.
I really love the video, too, and I'm hoping that this song is going to be on the 10,000.
Yes, it's a bonus song.
It might.
That would be cool.
Yeah, so should I reveal it now?
Sure, do it.
Okay, here's from the Goliath's bonus track.
Here's Terra with Alphyshear.
Oh, I thought you were just going to name it.
Hold on.
I've got to actually play it?
Hold on.
Sorry about that.
That's all right.
Hold on.
We can play it.
We'll play... How long is it?
I don't remember how long it is.
It's about 2 minutes 45 seconds.
Oh, that's not that long.
We can go ahead and play that.
I've got to get it, though.
Here we go.
Okay, so here it is.
Okay, from the top.
Introduce it again.
Here's the Goliath bonus track and tarot with Alpharshir.
And for those in studio, you can see the video if you want.
It's pretty cool.
Thank you for watching!
Thank you for watching!
I've been collecting the fragments of you that have changed into eternity
Thank you for watching!
Now that song is pretty badass, I gotta say.
It's a really good song, and I do hope that song does turn up in Ten Styles, one of the hidden tracks, because it's great.
And the video's great, too.
Like, you know, we're kind of sitting here in the studio watching it, and I'm hearing, ooh, I need an LJ Akana that.
Ooh, I need to cosplay that.
I need to do this.
I need to...
It's got a nice video, I like the setup.
For those who weren't able to see the video, it basically is, um, it's kind of like this epic battle with all the 2DX characters.
That's kind of what it is.
It looks like.
Yeah.
It's like, you know, it's like a bit from Eden.
Yeah.
Um, some expressions like...
Thank you for reminding us to check that out, because it's a pretty cool one, so thank you.
No problem.
Alright, well, anything else you want to share with our listeners?
Well, nothing much else.
Hopefully, when I get my copy of Tenstar, I will give you the details.
Alright, sounds good.
We'll be looking forward to hearing it.
Yeah.
Alright, take care, buddy.
Have a good one.
Later.
Later.
Okay, we're going to go to another call now here on the Skype line, and we'll see what this person wants.
Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Yes, we're here.
Can you hear me?
We can kind of hear you.
What's up?
Uh, not much.
I'm eating Doritos.
You're eating Doritos again, huh?
How you doing?
Uh, we got nacho this time.
I'm sorry?
We got nacho this time.
Nacho cheese this time.
Alright, what's on your mind?
Uh, I'm really hyped for Mario Kart DS.
You're hyped for Mario Kart DS.
I'm really hyped for this, too.
I think it's going to be awesome to be able to play people across the internet and all that stuff.
Yeah.
The news video I just saw, what was it, 25 minutes?
Just revealed a bunch of stuff.
It's crazy.
So, this game's out, what, like a week from Tuesday or something?
Yeah, it's out, yeah, it's the week of the 14th, sometime during that week.
That's the date.
I'm excited for it.
It's going to be a good time.
So now I hear you can have up to 50 people on your friends list or something through the game?
I don't know.
They didn't say that.
It's only four player though for the internet.
Well, I'm not too surprised by that because eight people would be an awful lot of bandwidth to have going everywhere.
Yeah, you don't want all that lag and stuff.
Yeah.
That sucks.
Any other games coming out soon that you're looking forward to?
You still have to give Midway Arcade Treasures 3 and DDR Mario Mix.
Midway Arcade Treasures 3 is pretty good.
It's a pretty solid game if you like racing games.
If you're waiting for more Midway Arcade stuff for the PSP, Arcade Treasures Extended Play is coming out in December, which is going to have a bunch of the old stuff plus Mortal Kombat 1 and 2.
Very cool.
I know about that.
Very cool.
Alright, anything else you want to share with our listeners?
Oh, yeah.
I got a link to this one site.
There's this guy who has made tons of progress on hacking the DS's Wi-Fi chip and stuff.
He's pretty much got it technically running.
Huh.
So what does it do?
Um, right now he's just trying to make the connection to a Wi-Fi hotspot.
Yeah, this is the guy that's, he's already won the bounty, basically, for the Wi-Fi, and now he's just finishing up, like, the last bit of it, but he finished enough of it to where they gave him, like, I think it was like $4,000.
Oh, I remember you mentioning that on a previous podcast about that.
Very cool.
Yeah.
That link's in our chatroom, www.orangeandradio.com, click on chat.
Another thing, just more Mario Kart DS stuff, there's actually the decal maker, you know what I'm talking about?
The decals, you can have in it.
On Mario Kart?
Yeah, can't you make your own decal or something when you're on the internet?
Yeah, uh, just, it, like, has a thing that'll connect to your name and also actually go on your cart on, like, the front of it and stuff.
Yeah, that sounds kinda cool.
I'm gonna post another link.
They actually have a, like, decal base on this site.
And you can make one before the game's even out, which is really cool.
I've got one here.
It's actually the Firefox logo, and it looks really good for just 17 colors.
It uses that technique of crisscrossing colors, you know what I'm talking about?
Yeah, yeah.
To make them look like a different color.
Okay, I'm going to check that.
So wait, you can make this before the game is out?
So you'll be able to transfer it from your PC somehow?
Well, you're not going to be able to transfer it, but you can plan it out and make one already.
You're going to have to recreate it, unfortunately.
Mr. Game & Watch!
Jamie's getting excited over there because she saw Mr. Game & Watch.
Yeah, that's funny.
Awesome, it's going to be a good time.
Alright, well thanks for sharing all those links with us, and we'll be all ready to kick your ass when Mario Kart DS comes out.
Oh, don't be so sure about that.
It's on.
We will have some type of Orange Lounge DS-a-thon, I'm sure.
I know my dream is to have the Orange Lounge Village on Animal Crossing, where you can come to our town and have Jamie whack you with a bug net.
That would be a good time.
We'll have that set up Sunday nights during the show or something.
We'll have the Orange Lounge Village where you can come.
I have all these great ideas.
I can't wait.
Okay.
All right.
Well, have a good one.
Thanks for calling.
Thanks.
All right.
Later.
Lots and lots of people hammering the line tonight.
Let's go to one more call for now.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Hi, this is GS191.
Hey, GS191, what's on your mind?
I just want to come on and whore out the Orange Launch Radio frapper.
Yes, now, the frapper, this was something that you created that you were plugging on the forums.
This is pretty cool.
Tell our listeners about this.
It basically just lets you, like, you can, like, let listeners, like... Are you still there?
You cut out for a minute there.
Yeah, yeah, I'm thinking.
Sorry.
It's alright.
Let me help you out.
It looks like something that's based off of Google Maps or something?
Yes, it is.
And it allows you to plot points?
Yeah.
Kind of so, but you guys as the listeners can plot points on this map so we can see where you live.
Yeah, pretty much.
And I'm going to post a link.
Oh, it looks like we both did at the same time there.
Post a link to the official Orange Lounge Radio Frapper, so you guys should go visit it and plot yourself on the map, and that way we can see just where all our listeners are.
And so when we see that we have a lot of listeners in one area, we might have to go, oh, we better send somebody to a tournament or something, get some coverage out there.
Yeah.
Oh yeah, yeah.
So go add yourself to the frapper, boys and girls.
And if you're not in the chat room and couldn't get the link, it's www.frappr.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
Alright, well thank you so much for making that and suggesting that, GS191, and I hope we get tons of people on it, so we can be giddy map people, I don't know.
Alright.
Sure, thanks.
Yeah, sure.
Alright, take care.
Okay, you too, bye.
Bye.
All right, we're going to go ahead and turn off the Skype line for now.
We will take more calls a little later on in the program.
However, I think at this point, we're going to go ahead and get into the Orange Lounge Radio cage match for tonight.
Does that sound like fun, boys and girls?
Oui.
Alright, so I gotta get the Cage Match music queued up, but of course we had a retiree from last week, so we're gonna have three brand new songs in tonight's Cage Match.
So tonight's Cage Match is gonna take a little more time than usual, because we're gonna have three songs in their entirety.
Let's get it started.
Alright, the way the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match works is that you have to be in our chat room at www.orangeloungeradio.com.
We are going to play three songs for you, and since there is no reigning champion, because we retired last week's winner, as it was its fourth win in a row, that was Pendulum with Hold Your Color, that song was retired, we're going to play three brand new songs for you in their entirety, okay?
So, you're going to vote for your favorite in our chatroom at www.orangeloungeradio.com and your favorite song that you guys vote for will go into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's 24-hour day, 7-day-a-week, Bimani and Video Game Music program, which has had a lot of you guys listening to it lately, so we appreciate that.
Alright, so let's get it started.
I guess I will go ahead since I technically...
Hold Your Color by Pendulum
Depeche Mode Precious
Precious and fragile things Need special handling My God, what have we done to you?
We always tried to share The tenderest of care Now look what we have
Angels with silver wings Shoulder no suffering I wish I could take the pain for you If God has a master plan That only he understands I hope it's
I thought we'd manage
Thanks for watching!
Alright, that was song number one in tonight's cage match.
That was Depeche Mode with Precious.
Was that song the Precious or was that song the crappy?
Our judges in studio will let you know.
DarkSakura.
I haven't really cared for anything Depeche Mode's done since the 80s because as I'm, you know, prone to calling them depressed mode.
Yeah, there's a little emo.
It's very sedate.
It actually reminds me of some of the stuff from Silent Hill 3 along the same lines.
I like it a lot.
As listening, it gets a 10.
For cage magic, it gets an 8.
Okay, it is a little emo.
I'll go ahead and do my ranking.
It is a little emo and a little sad for Cage Match, but I'm in a chill mood lately, where I'm in an emo mood, I guess.
I'll admit it.
I can be emo once in a while.
So I give that song an 8 as well.
It's fun.
Loki.
Now, I think, I was going to say, Depeche Mode is kind of going the way of Crystal Method, where their last album sucked.
Crystal Method's last album sucks, but the one before it was really good.
And this one, if this is one of the best songs on the album, then I'm kind of leery because I really did like Exciter.
That was one of my favorite Depeche Mode albums.
And this one, it's okay, but I have to listen to the rest of it before I can make my judgment on the whole thing.
But I give it an 8.
It's pretty good.
It's just Depeche Mode can't really do wrong.
Alright.
8, 8, 8, and now it's Angel's turn.
Angel, what do you think?
It's Depeche Mode.
It's cool.
Eight.
Right, I somehow knew she'd give it an eight as well.
How could you not at that point?
Alright, eights across the board for Depeche Mode Precious.
But remember, it's not up to us to decide.
Our scores don't mean shit.
It's like that game Whose Line Is Anyway.
The scores don't mean shit.
It's up to you guys and your votes in the chatroom.
We're just kind of coaxing you.
I believe that was the first time we've done that across the board, actually.
In a while.
I know it's been done before.
Because I remember, as soon as I remember, there was a mix of girls who was in the cage match once that got like zeros across the board from everybody, including Loki.
Anyway, let's go on to the next song, the second song of tonight's cage match.
We're going to go ahead and do Loki's pick.
Loki, what'd you pick tonight?
I picked a song that's off of the CD.
It's actually pretty cool.
Kalinda, I've never heard of them before, but they're on one of those compilation trance CDs.
And it sounded pretty good.
It's upbeat, short.
That's all you need to know.
It's upbeat and short.
Alright, well we'll be the judges of that.
Here it is, song number two in tonight's cage match.
Kalinda with I'll Surrender.
I'm giving up this fight I'm giving up this fight
Okay, that was song number two in tonight's cage match.
That was Kalinda, or maybe Kalienda, with I'll Surrender.
Will you surrender to that song, or will you hold it hostage?
DarkSakura.
I don't want to do either.
It was generic.
I think it's a five.
I have to admit, usually those are the types of songs I'm a sucker for, and there was some lovely instrumentation in that song, and the woman did have a pretty voice, but I just...
I'm too emo for that song tonight.
I really am in an emo mood today, so I can't appreciate that song as much as I should, so I have to give it like a 6.
I'm very sorry, Loki.
Loki.
It gets an 8, and ironically enough, that's the amount of max sim files that have been posted to my cell since they've relaunched.
Beautiful.
Alright, Angel, what did you think of I'll Surrender?
It was okay.
Um, 7 1⁄2.
Nice.
7 1⁄2 from Angel.
Okay, song number three tonight is DarkSakura's pick.
DarkSakura, what did you choose for us?
Only by Nine Inch Nails, just because.
Just because?
Yeah, I've been in the mood.
Is this like one of their hard-hitting industrial songs, or is this kind of a... You'll find out.
Oh, well, oh snap.
Okay, we will.
Here we go.
Song number three is Nine Inch Nails with Only.
Thanks for watching!
Thanks for watching!
I just want you all to remember me myself again And I just want you all to know
Thanks for watching!
All right, that was... Sorry, I'm laughing because they're having the soda versus pop debate in chat.
We'll get to that in a minute.
For now, let's review song number three, Nine Inch Nails with Only.
Is that the only song for you, or is that a song you would like to, I don't know, equivalent to Nine Inch Nails on a chalkboard?
DarkSakura.
You know, it's not the usual Nine Inch Nails song, and if I was in a normal mood, I would probably penalize the song for not sounding like a normal Nine Inch Nails song.
However, it fits my emo mood.
Therefore, it gets a bonus point, and I give it a 9.
I am in a normal mood, and I'm going to penalize it for not being a normal Nine Inch Nails song.
It gets a 5.
Angel has left the room momentarily, but we would assume that she would give it a 10.
Well, yeah, she gave everything else an 8 tonight.
Oh, there's Angel.
What would you give that song, Nine Inch Nails only?
An 8.
See, there you go.
But remember, it's not up to us, it's up to you.
Here are the three songs you can vote for tonight.
A quick recap in tonight's cage match.
Three brand new songs, no returning champions.
Song number one, Precious, Depeche Mode.
And song number two you can vote for tonight is Kalenda with I'll Surrender.
And song number three you can vote for tonight is Nine Inch Nails with Only
All right kids, place vote now.
Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote for Depeche Mode, song number one, Calienda, song number two, or Nine Inch Nails, song number three.
Do it.
Do it now.
All the cool kids are doing it.
And if you don't, you are going to get a massive wedgie from all of us.
Loki, what's going on in the sim scene, dare I ask, in the Dance Dance Revolution and other music gaming simulation?
As I mentioned before, with the eight brand new Max remixes, not much as far as the sim file section goes on my cell, or at least all the...
Submissions, but there is another tournament going on.
Since TourneyMix is gone for good, hopefully, we have OSC 4, or the original step file competition 4, and basically the rules are a little bit different than TourneyMix, and basically the main stuff is... Let's see here...
Basically, the staff can't enter, which is probably good, because why would they be voting on their own songs?
But anyways, there's going to be one... I don't know, it looks exactly the same to me, to be honest.
They have different divisions, DDR, Indigroove, and Keyboard.
So I'm guessing Playable, Not Quite Playable, and Not Playable would be those three categories.
And...
It doesn't really say when the submissions are due yet, but let's see.
Oh, my mistake.
November 13th is one.
So you said that Tournamix is gone forever?
Supposedly.
There's no public voting, so basically it's just by panel review.
The public, though, can post the reviews for the songs in each division when they're released and rank it.
And the average score from the public review is then taken and will make up 50% of the song's final division score.
And hopefully, hopefully, they will post, or they won't post, who the song was made by.
You know, then make it fair.
But I don't think that's going to happen.
So yeah, that's about it other than Dance Tracks, a new Stepmania-based game making its way to the web.
And of course, hopefully pretty soon, the arcades.
No real details on it at all other than the fact that you've got people like DM Ashura, B-Drop, and just other people doing music for it.
So, it'll be interesting.
That's it.
All right.
Moving on, DarkSakura, I know you were surfing the web a little bit there in the background, and you found some pictures from an upcoming movie that we're very excited about.
I thought maybe you wanted to share this with our listeners.
Oh, yeah.
Silent Hill movie image is up on IGN.
One of our listeners linked it on our website, on our forums.
Anyone who was basically naysaying, if these images are any type of indication, it is Silent Hill.
It's official.
Very, very perfect.
Down to the environment, down to the...
Even the colors that the characters are dressed in is very somber.
It completely matches the style.
I'm very excited after seeing the pictures.
It looks like they're going to get it right.
I'm so excited that they might get a video game movie right.
I'm just elated.
So I'm very, very happy about that.
Of course, then again, the Mortal Kombat pictures were cool when I first saw them, too.
But I have hope.
These three can look like they're from the game, only better quality, of course.
In other news, during the Saw II of the previews, they played Blood Rains, which I yelled out in the middle of the audience, A MOVIE FUCKING SUCKS!
Everyone laughed.
I need to see Doom so I can laugh at it.
I think Doom has already fallen out of the top ten movies.
It's gone.
It's gone.
And made, I think, like half of its budget back, if even that.
Let's see, what else?
Oh, did you guys hear this week what movie has got a push to be made now?
A video game movie was licensed out and now has a director attached and the script's being written for?
Castlevania.
Castlevania's being turned into a movie.
It better be done right, that's all I can say.
Here's who's attached to direct.
I believe his name is Paul Anderson.
He was the guy that did Mortal Kombat and Resident Evil.
Well now, Mortal Kombat was a good movie and Resident Evil was a good movie.
Well, I like Resident Evil, shut up.
They were fun.
I'll give it that.
They were fun movies.
They weren't Oscar caliber movies, but they were fun.
Mortal Kombat, I think, was done right.
They were tolerable.
You know, when you put them next to a UE Bowl movie, I mean, honestly, it doesn't look that bad.
They actually are pretty good.
Mortal Kombat was, you put Mortal Kombat, the movie, next to Street Fighter, the movie, and it's like, oh, I'll watch Mortal Kombat like 20 times.
Seriously.
So, honestly, probably Paul Anderson, to date, has set the bar for
A decent video game movie that is yet to be exceeded.
I don't think there has been a better video game movie than Mortal Kombat or Resident Evil.
I'm quite excited about the Peter Jackson Halo.
But see, with Silent Hill on deck and Halo eventually, I think it's going to push the bar up.
I'm hoping.
I hope so too.
And Uwe Boll needs to stop making movies.
Period.
Of course we talked about on the last podcast the Dungeon Siege is going to be two movies.
Four hours long.
It's an epic Uwe Boll event.
I have not actually seen an Uwe Boll movie yet just because they're so bad but I really need to sit down so I can nitpick them on particular issues because I know that just the movies overall are really bad and uninspiring and just awful but I'm kind of curious to see Blood Rain because at least she gets naked.
So at least they've got that going for it.
So, yeah, that'd be good.
No, no, no, I don't even need it.
Bye, bye.
I thought you were going to comment on something.
Weren't you excited about Castlevania, the movie, or as I call it, Castlevania?
Mmm, Simon.
Simon?
Okay.
Let's hope to hell to get the right actor to play Simon.
I know, why don't they just have Hugh Jackman do it again?
I have an idea.
How about we get Vin Diesel to play Simon Belmont?
How about no?
Jim Carrey is Simon Belmont.
You know, not to throw this topic in the gutter, but Vin Diesel is a very, very big joke around World of Warcraft right now.
Anyway, whatever.
Vin Diesel will play, Arnold Schwarzenegger will play all the characters in the movie.
Dave Chappelle as Simon Belmont.
Like Carlos Bensia as Dracula.
And Pablo Francisco as the background effects?
Uh, never mind.
Jigsaw the Clown is Simon Belmont.
Let me wait.
Moving on, that should be interesting.
Oh no, before we go to a break, I want to talk about Xbox 360.
And of course, I want to bring this up again on the podcast a little later.
Oh, speaking of tonight's podcast, damn, I said I would get this out at some point.
Tonight's podcast is going to be the winner, because we have not one, but two interviews on tonight's podcast.
It's going to be cool.
We're actually going to be doing a follow-up.
I don't know if you guys heard about this, but King's Quest 9, there was this fan project going on to create a fan version of King's Quest.
Thanks for watching!
Thanks for watching!
KQIX as they call it for short.
So tune into that.
But also, this is something I probably will address on the podcast as well, but I have to bring this up on the live show because I get more time to rant here than I do on the podcast.
And that has to do with Xbox 360.
Now, Loki, you were saying that you're going to be getting yours on launch day.
Well, every day I kind of question that more and more just because
of what Microsoft's doing, they're trickling in the allocation, so it's like, okay, X store, you had 200 Xboxes, thank you for pre-selling all those, we're gonna send you 10, you know, or like, you know, stuff like that, it's just really ridiculous, the store I booked mine at is not as busy as the other store that I used to, the GameStop I used to pre-book stuff at was in the mall,
You know, high traffic GameStop and stuff.
And it was a bitch and a half to try to get anything from them.
So now I've booked stuff now at the GameStop that's only a couple blocks from my house.
It's really small.
There's never really anyone in there and that type of stuff.
So I'm hoping that there's not that many people that have booked them.
And I got in on one of the few that they've got.
But...
Even like some of the stores that hardly have any pre-orders for them, they're not getting hardly anything.
So it's really iffy.
Hopefully I am because I've got two games on order there and two on order at my work.
And so I'm really trying to get a lot of this stuff in.
Plus I'm trying to butter up the people we sell to, the publishers, to have them send me some free stuff.
But that's a whole other story.
I got to play an Xbox 360 kiosk finally.
Where's that at?
Best Buy has them.
Two of them in the area have the kiosk set up.
The one over by Birdcage has one.
That's where I played it yesterday.
They have demos of Cameo and Call of Duty 2.
And King Kong?
No, just those two.
Or at least those two were the only ones I noticed that were playable.
I know they had videos of a bunch of other ones, too.
I don't remember... King Kong's playable, usually.
But it might be a different disc, who knows.
Yeah, or I just missed it completely.
But I did notice specifically those two games were playable.
And I have to say, I was incredibly underwhelmed with Camp.
Cameo was the one I really paid attention to.
Call of Duty 2 had pretty graphics and stuff, but Cameo was a little bit underwhelming.
I can see where people are making these Xbox 1.5 comparisons where it just looks slightly better than the Xbox.
It's not that much better.
I'm surprised because Cameo was actually one of the ones I was pretty impressed with.
All the first party stuff seemed to be pretty good and Cameo was one of them.
I don't know if maybe the particular level or the sub that they have is not very forgiving to the game but the one that we saw they were showing kind of like the draw distance of the game and stuff and there was like hundreds and thousands of like these creatures just battling on the
and so on.
It's definitely going to be interesting.
The jury's out now for me.
I was completely sold on Xbox 360 and I wanted to pick one up on launch day, but now I'm not so sure I want to get one on launch day.
I don't know if I want to fight those crowds and stuff, so we'll see how that goes.
It's going to kind of depend on what mood I'm in that day, but after spending $70 on Guitar Hero, I don't know if I want to spend another $400 on Xbox, so we'll see.
Anyway, somebody in chat room asked me very nicely if they could call in because they had a story related to what we're talking about right now.
So I said, okay, I'll make an exception.
So who do we have on the line?
Hi, it's Sephiroth1215 here.
Hello, Sephiroth1215.
Now, what did you want to say in regards to Xbox 360?
I actually said briefly in the chat room before, but no one really responded, so I don't even know if people were paying attention.
We're trying to stay on top of it, but we also enjoy listening to ourselves talk, so it's kind of hard to stay on top of it sometimes.
I think I saw it.
Go ahead.
But yeah, I actually just went by a Toys R Us today, and I was able to reserve one.
Guaranteed to get it in the 22nd.
When did Toys R Us start doing reserves?
That's the point.
Everybody forgot about Toys R Us.
That's why I keep saying, go to Toys R Us, go to Target, and stuff like that, because no one remembers about Toys R Us.
But Target doesn't do reserves.
I know, but they're going to get their games in.
See, the systems are going to be in it at Target.
You have to be there at 6 in the morning, and they're basically going to go out there
it's first come first serve, the first people in line or whatever get this card that entitles them to buy the system and then they keep doing it until it's sold out and that's it
Loki, tell me, why should I buy an Xbox 360?
Why?
Why do I need one in two weeks or whenever the damn thing's coming out?
Well, personally, like me, I'm a consumer whore and I have to get it right when it comes out.
Just mainly the reason why I want to get it so I can review this stuff right.
Kind of try to get an edge on everything because I know we're not IGN, we're not GameSpot or anything like that.
And so having this console now as opposed to two months from now
It's important to me, so I need to get that stuff.
The other thing is, also, with the date of the PlayStation 3 kind of up in the air, the next system that we know is going to launch is going to be in June, which is the revolution.
That's, you know, almost seven months away.
I don't want to wait seven months, so, you know, I got to do that, and also Burnout's coming out in March, so... Oh, yeah, there's the real answer.
Okay, all right.
So, how much did they make you put down at Toys R Us for the Xbox 360?
Only 50, but the problem is you have to get a bundle.
So you have to get the, not the core, but the... I keep forgetting the name.
There's core and there's... Just Xbox 360.
The plus, the plus pack or whatever.
Just 360.
Hold on, I mean, of course you have to get the premium version, which is alright anyway, because that's going to be the harder one to find.
And cores are going to be probably pretty easy, but still... Wait, are they making you get games with it too?
Yeah.
I heard a rumor about this now.
Wasn't there something on Slash Thought about how Microsoft was like forcing retailers to make sure people walk out the door with two games or something like that?
Well, you're going to have to because in order for them to be guaranteed to get them in, they have to guarantee that they're going to do $10 million with Microsoft in like, I want to say the next year or in the next few months.
So $10 million, you're going to have to push those games like big time.
I just, I, honestly, the more and more I hear, the less and less I want to support this system on the launch day, because I don't like their tactics.
I realize it's all business, and it's just, you know, trying to make money and stuff, and trying to, you know, sell as many as they can before Christmas, but honestly, there's got to be a better way of doing it.
The whole thing is, though, is they're trickling them out so they can say, oh yeah, it sold out on the first day.
Well, yeah, if you put out half the amount that you're supposed to put out, of course it's going to sell out, morons.
but the gamer community is well aware of what Microsoft's trying to play with us and the average consumer does not follow the game industry and they don't know better the average consumer is not going to be waiting at 6 o'clock in the morning out front of Target when Lil Billy wants to get his fucking Xbox 360 for Christmas you better damn well believe people are going to be waiting in line for these things they're fighting over I mean look at Tickle Me Elmo that thing is fucking retarded but people went out and bought them got in riots it's retarded but that's what it is
and so on.
Yeah, because, you know, they're really known for gaming in their PCs.
If Apple and Nintendo teamed up, I swear to God, it would be a force to beat.
Apple and Nintendo, if they teamed up, they're the masters of getting people to buy the same shit over.
I mean, look at what Apple just fucking did.
They released an iPod, and then they said, no, no, no, no, you've got to have an iPod Color.
No, no, no, no, no, you've got to have an iPod Shuffle.
No, no, no, no, wait, an iPod Nano.
No, no, no, no, wait, we've got one that plays videos.
They played a Nintendo.
Exactly.
Apple and Nintendo, a match made in heaven.
Tell me it shouldn't happen.
I agree.
I should.
Okay, sorry Sephiroth, we're just making you listen to our rants there, but... That's alright.
I think Loki's pretty much completely right on this one, though.
Yeah, I hate to say it, but I know Loki's right on this one, but it doesn't piss me off any less, though.
I see what you mean, but us gamers have to get it when we can anyway, so... I know.
Anything else you want to share with our listeners?
Uh, yeah, I mean, I realize getting a bundle isn't too bad, because even with the games that it's coming with, it's three games, and I could just go back to another Toys R Us, or go to a Walmart and return for credit without a receipt, so it's not too bad.
Now that's thinking.
I like the way this guy thinks.
Smart idea.
If you don't want to have to buy these, forced to buy these games or whatever, then just buy them and take them back to another store.
Beautiful idea.
I like it.
All right.
Well, thank you so much for calling in.
We're going to try and get past this topic soon enough, but we appreciate your perspective and letting us know about Toys R Us.
That's a good FYI.
And somebody in chat suggested Circuit City, which I think is another good idea.
Everybody forgets about Circuit City.
And also, there's some other places that you would never think to book a 360, that one being Kohl's.
I didn't even know Kohl's carried electronics, let alone having 360s.
Kohl's is one of them.
Also, like I mentioned before, Target and Best Buy.
Best Buy they're saying is going to have a lot more because apparently Bill Gates is going to be whoring the Xbox 360 out at one of the Best Buys in Manhattan.
That's the rumor, at least.
And because of that, there's a deal now where they're going to be getting a larger allocation over everybody else.
Suckin' Microsoft's Cock for more Xboxes.
Beautiful.
And, um, basically, yeah, just a lot of these, you know, sores that everybody forgets about, just go check them and see if you can get a 360 there.
Fucking Kohl's?
Kohl's.
I can walk out of there with, um, an Xbox 360 and new... And a hoe!
And new underwear.
And a hoe.
But yeah, for when I soil my pants at Dead or Alive 4.
Yes, anything else?
But honestly, yeah, it will be possible to get one by this launch day, I'm sure, if you just try hard enough.
It's not too hard.
So, I mean, if people rush out the Toys R Us, like, tomorrow, I'm sure you might be able to get one, a reserve, but there's still going to be limited quantities.
and also I say don't listen to the people at EB or GameStop because all they ever tell me is, no, you can't go anywhere else.
And I took off my money from my reserve at EB today and they laughed at me saying you're not going to be able to get it because I guess they're told that the only reserve for them and the only way you're going to be able to get it is through them.
Thanks for watching!
All right, anyway, appreciate that call there.
Got us on a little bit of a rant about Xbox 360.
Now, this I think is really interesting, and Loki, I saw you had this up earlier.
Can you go back to 1up.com and their story about the, oh, you already had it, great, the Xbox 360 versus the Dreamcast?
Yeah.
I think this article is so hilarious where they compare the Dreamcast, which, you know, Dreamcast...
It didn't succeed, but it wasn't because it was a bad system, because Dreamcast actually had a lot of good stuff on it.
Phantasy Star Online was revolutionary, and the little... What was the thingy called?
The VMU?
That could have its own games on it?
That stuff was revolutionary.
But unfortunately, the Dreamcast didn't succeed.
So it's interesting to see them drawing comparisons to the Dreamcast and the Xbox 360.
So this article is over on 1up.com.
Loki, read us like five or so comparisons here between Dreamcast and 360.
Launched the year before the competition, and that's the same on both.
Okay.
Let's see here.
Had a sleek white console following the footsteps of a bulky black console.
Now, technicality though, my Xbox is green.
The Little Swirly
That's creepy.
Let's see here.
We've also got Promise to be an evolutionary system to someday play DVDs.
It says, Promise to be an evolutionary system someday to play HD DVDs.
Interesting.
Now, Dreamcast did end up supporting DVDs eventually, didn't they?
No, they never did.
No, they never did?
You know why I'm confusing it?
Because you could play VCDs.
You could download things from the internet to play VCDs.
I'm confusing it.
And then, of course, one of my favorites is, for the Dreamcast, Metal Gear Solid 2 trailer stole much of its next generation thunder.
And then for the Xbox 360, Metal Gear Solid 4 trailer stole much of its next generation thunder.
It'll be interesting to see what happens.
But then they go into another, now there's a spin-off article, now it's not all, you know, they're not trying to say Xbox 360 is going to definitely, you know, fade away like the Dreamcast did, but they do say that there's things that the Xbox 360 has going for it that the Dreamcast did not.
There's like a sequel to the article also on the site, so check those out.
There's a whole, a lot of stuff that...
You know, personally, it's just the people that are going to be buying it aren't smart enough to, like, say, okay, Microsoft, you know, you're really holding back your allocations, you know, that's kind of pissing me off, I'm going to go buy something else.
People aren't going to do that.
They're just going to be like, well, I'm going to wait, you know, or something.
Because it's the first system next gen that's coming out.
The system is only as good as the games on it.
Xbox 360, though, has some pretty good games on it.
I'm most excited... I will give them a lot... They're launching better this time because they actually have something on it that is not a fighting, a driving, or sports title on it.
They have, you know, like Cameo, and they have some other, you know, interesting titles around launch, the Elder Scrolls and stuff, so it's nice to see variety in their launch titles this time.
No, no, no.
They have Cameo.
Well, on the actual launch day they have cameo, but they have Elder Scrolls, you know, not that far out, right?
April.
And then King Kong is a little bit different, too.
Give it that.
It's a first-person shooter still, sort of.
It's not much of a... Okay, well, anyways, yeah, so they're coming out with some more stuff later.
All right.
We're going to go to a break, guys.
When we come back from this break, the long promised, we said we were going to do it all night.
We're going to get to it listless.
We haven't done this segment in a long time.
You said we were going to do it all night.
Do it all night.
No, we're not going to hear that song in this break because I don't want to hear Erotic tonight.
But I do want to hear this request.
Angel?
You don't want to listen to Erotic tonight?
What?
I told you.
I'm in a mood.
I'm in this emo mood tonight.
I don't know what it is.
Well, then go scare them with emo or something.
Well, no, I'm actually going to be a good co-host, and I'm going to play a request that somebody requested in our chat room.
And that was for some Captain Jack.
So we're going to do some Captain Jack starting off this break.
And we'll be back with tonight's list list regarding Guitar Hero 2, hypothetically.
Of course, it hasn't been announced yet, but come on.
Come on.
All they have to do is make their money back, and there'll be a Guitar Hero 2.
There's got to be one.
All right, we'll be back after this.
We'll start it off with some Captain Jack fifth mix style, yo.
Thank you for watching!
Thanks for watching!
Welcome back boys and girls to Orange Lounge Radio and I bet you kids are dying to know who won tonight's cage match because we had the votes tallied.
So, tonight's winner...
It was a very, very, very close vote, by the way.
Like all three songs, neck and neck and neck.
In fact, tonight's vote was so close, we have a tie.
A tie in tonight's cage match.
So here are the songs that are tied.
The first song that's tied tonight is... Depeche Mode with Precious.
And the second song that is tied tonight is...
Nine Inch Nails with Old Wings.
So apparently the chatroom is feeling very emo too.
Although there were quite a few votes for song number two, just not enough unfortunately.
So going to the cage match rulebook, the way we break a tie, the host who picked the song that did not tie gets to break the vote.
So Loki, which song's gonna win?
Depeche Mode.
Depeche Mode wins tonight's cage match.
Any particular reason why you went for that one?
I don't know, I just like Depeche Mode.
Fair enough.
It was the most emo of the two.
You mean most emo-ist?
Yeah.
That's what next week I'm wrapping up.
Mamma Mia?
No.
Oh, can't wait.
Actually, no, I won't be here next week, so yeah, Mamma Mia will be in the cage match.
Okay, in two weeks we'll look forward to it.
I won't even be here.
Living it up!
You're going to be at the, well, the Gay Frat House doesn't exist anymore.
The Gay Frat House is gone.
That's too bad.
I will be living it up in SoCal.
Where my harem of adoring math players will be waiting for me.
This is next week?
Are you going to go see Harry Potter down there?
I thought it was the week after, how dare you?
Make my heart stop
Speaking of which, I have nobody to go with because, um... You can come with us.
Temagus doesn't like Harry Potter.
You can come with us and screw him.
Okay.
Anybody want to come kidnap me?
Don't, like, literally screw him, but, you know.
Uh, I don't do that anyway, you sicko.
Alright, anyway.
Um, no, but DarkSakura's going to be gone next week for a legitimate business purpose, right?
Tell them where you're going to be.
To meet my adoring fans!
Where at?
at the Podcast Awards, alright?
DarkSakura's gonna be representing us at the Podcast Awards.
I'm going to be there in all of my, in all of my, uh, dark glory.
I didn't go because he wouldn't give me any, like, time on the mic.
He'd be like, thank you for, and then I would just, and then Loki would get to go up there and go, it's so much fun, and then get cut off.
I'm going to say, give me a dollar!
And he goes sit down.
Don't embarrass us, DarkSakura.
I never do.
It's a fair representation of the show.
Could you please thank my mother while you're down there?
I thank your mother.
I'd like to thank your mom.
All right.
We're going to get into tonight's list very shortly, but I do want to give a little bit of a reminder.
Ultramix 3, right around the corner.
Ultramix 3's got a damn impressive lineup.
Is that out this Tuesday, I think?
Next week.
Next week?
I heard it was leaking early, I don't know.
I swear to God, again I'm going to go broke before my birthday, right Rob?
You also have that same week, Flow, the Urban Dance Uprising, in case you feel a little bit like a breakbeat mood and you have the extra money to waste on stuff.
Yeah, like I said, Ultramix 3 is coming out, and I know a lot of you guys are going to buy Ultramix 3, and you wouldn't want to buy any other dancing game except Ultramix 3 that day.
All right.
Oh, I wanted to mention something about DDR and Mario, too.
I keep putting off the list list.
But DDR and Mario, there's been tournaments going on, like, everywhere.
There was actually one here in Sacramento.
I don't know if you guys heard of this.
I didn't go.
However, I heard that a whopping five people entered the tournament.
So congratulations to whoever won out of those five people.
Was it?
A free copy of Mario DDR.
Was it Andrew?
I don't know.
No, I don't think it was him that won.
I think it was somebody else.
I don't know who won, but I know who posted about it.
Uh, yeah, explicit.
Anyway, yeah.
I don't know who won.
We'll have to find out from him.
I'm sure they did a fabulous job and earned their Mario DDR, which is a game I don't think I'm going to buy.
Honestly, I'm not feeling the Mario DDR.
I love Nintendo, I love DDR, but I'm not feeling the Mario DDR.
I know it would last five minutes.
The honeymoon would be over before it begins.
Hey, well, you know what you have to steal your money instead?
Mario Party 7.
Okay, I'll go with that, because I love playing Mario Party 7, because I'm an evil bitch when I play as Peach in that game.
I'm a vindictive motherfucker.
They need DS Mario Party, so we can get some Wi-Fi going.
I heard that was a rumor, something that was in development, was the DS Mario Party.
We'll see, though, we'll see.
Because think about all the mini-games, because the mini-games are starting to get a little stale, but think about all the new stuff they could do with the pen.
Yeah.
It'd be fun.
All right, let's get into tonight's listless.
All right.
The way that Listless works, because it's been a hell of a long time since we've done one of these segments, what we're going to do is each of us here in studio, so it would be the three hosts, myself, DarkSakura, and Loki, and then our special guest, Angel, because Bug left.
He decided to go watch Family Guy or something.
We're each going to put in three...
Subtitles by Subtitle Workshop
And then we come up through this highly scientific process we call listless of the top three songs we want to see in Guitar Hero 2.
All right.
So that being said, let's start it off.
Everybody ready to go?
Got their three songs?
There we go.
All right.
Angel, you're lowest on the totem pole.
You start us off.
Just messing with you.
What's your number three pick?
Anything from Dragon Force.
You guys are like, huh?
Okay, Dragon Force is like a metal band.
I don't know what it is.
I think they're from like Norway or something.
Go ahead.
As Rob opens, oh, never mind.
As Rob types in stuff.
I thought it was like going on to Google or something.
Give me a song.
Give me any song that Dragon Force did.
I forgot.
Praise something.
Whatever.
Anyway.
It's like some of their new ones that nobody knows about yet.
It's the first song.
Um, somebody wanna google that?
Go ahead.
All right, anything by Dragon Force, first thing on tonight's list.
We'll go over, I'll go next.
My number three pick for tonight's list list is the song Bitch by Meredith Brooks.
And I don't know if you remember this song from the 90s, it was kind of a one-hit wonder.
I'm a bitch.
I actually met this woman once, she was really nice, and she actually is a really good guitar player, and that's something people never really picked up about her, but she's inspired by Hendrix and all those people.
She's a really good guitar player, and I just want to play Bitch.
on Guitar Hero, that would rock.
So that's my pick for number three song.
Loki.
My number three song is going to be Kenny Loggins with Danger Zone.
That song, granted, it's really cheesy and stuff, but it's really a good guitar song.
Is that the same one from Top Gun?
Yep, that would be the same one from Top Gun.
Alright, DarkSakura, that's the queen of the show, you get to go last.
Number three, ACDC, Highway to Hell.
I am throwing up the horns as we speak.
Now we're fucking talking.
Highway to Hell.
Although I can't fucking stand that guy's voice.
I love the guitar.
So that would be a badass song to play in Guitar Hero.
I definitely support you.
I will not take that off the list, I guarantee you.
Alright, let's go around to the number two picks.
Angel, what's your number two pick?
Pearl Jam, uh, either, oh hell, okay fine, Alive.
That's a good band to have in Guitar Hero, Pearl Jam, we kind of missed them in the last one, so okay, Alive by Pearl Jam, Angel's number two pick, good pick.
Loki, what's your number two pick?
Um, my number two pick, what was it, toss up, um, Filter with Hey Man Nice Shot.
Alright.
Is it true that that song's about some guy that killed himself or something?
I have no idea.
Eh, Curcumin?
No, that's tasteless.
I shit you not.
Wow, alright.
My number two pick, my number two pick for a song that should be in Guitar Hero 2 would be Are You Gonna Go My Way by Lenny Kravitz.
Because that song's badass and it has a great guitar riff in it.
Are you gonna go my way?
So I'm gonna do that.
Are You Gonna Go My Way by Lenny Kravitz.
DarkSakura, your number two pick.
I'm going... God damn this stupid thing.
I'm going to have to go with Metallica, and I've had a hard time narrowing it down, because there's just a whole bunch of fucking good Metallica songs.
So I'd have to say... Yeah, actually, I'm going to have to go with Master of Puppets.
Okay, thank you.
I'm glad you changed your mind at the last minute and decided not to do a newer song.
So Master of Puppets by Metallica.
Badass.
I'm liking this list so far.
We got some good shit on here.
We're going to rock out on Guitar Hero 2.
I hope Red Octane's listening.
Angel, your number one pick for song you most want to see in fucking Guitar Hero 2.
I'm going to scare you guys with this one.
Rainbow with Stargazer.
Just cause like the guitar in that's pretty cool.
I have a massive question mark over my head.
Really?
Richie Blackmore.
Anyway, yeah, 1976, you don't want to know.
Okay, some classic stuff, some old classic stuff.
Stargazer by Rainbow.
Alright, Loki, your number one pick for song that oughta damn well better be in Guitar Hero 2.
Soundgarden with Black Hole Sun.
Nice pick.
Black Hole Sun by Soundgarden.
Good pick.
Spoonman would be good too.
If we could have had the video too, because that's one of my favorite videos of all time.
I mean, who doesn't love the Black Hole Sun video?
That'd be great, you know, if they could do it where they play the video in the background of the stage while they're doing the song.
Like on a big monitor.
In Amplitude they did that.
I remember.
You could see the Blink-182 video in that one song.
Cool.
Alright, my number one pick for song I would most want to see in Guitar Hero 2 would be More Human Than Human by White Zombie.
Shit, yeah.
I love that song, so we're gonna do More Human Than Human by White Zombie.
DarkSakura, your number one pick.
It was a really tough thing for me to think of.
However, I'm gonna go with Blur's song too.
The Woohoo one.
For the people who only know it as the Woohoo song.
I knew that Blur or Gorillaz would be on your list somewhere.
That's a good choice.
It doesn't matter, there's no other way.
Okay, but I think more people, of course, more people know, you know, woohoo, everybody knows that one, so.
Am I allowed to kill one?
No, I mean, yes.
Okay, what?
Change Dragonforce, I can't believe I said that, but change Dragonforce to Foo Fighters Everlong.
Oh, that's a good one.
Alright, so here's the list as it stands so far.
Everlong by Foo Fighters, Bitch by Meredith Brooks, Danger Zone by Kenny Loggins, Highway to Hell by ACDC, Alive by Pearl Jam, Hey Man Nice Shot by Filter, Are You Gonna Go My Way by Lenny Kravitz, Master of Puppets by Metallica, Stargazer by Rainbow,
Black Hole Sun by Soundgarden, More Human Than Human by White Zombie, Song 2 by Blur.
You know what?
Fuck.
Let's just send this to Red Octane and say this is what we want.
I mean, this is a great list right here.
This is an awesome list.
I do think that our top three, we actually should say, hey, all of the listeners of Orange Lounge Radio voted and want these songs in the next game.
You know what's interesting about this list, though?
No Nirvana.
We have Foo Fighters.
I was thinking it.
Oh, Roz mentioned it.
I almost put it in with, uh, Whitesnake, Here I Go Again.
Oh, so many good songs.
Yeah.
This can only be the beginning of many great songs.
There's many, many great songs.
Obviously, we missed some big ones, but these are the ones that are near and dear to our heart.
If this is gonna be tough, I know I say this every week, that it's gonna be tough to eliminate songs from the list, but tonight especially, this one is gonna suck, because this is a really good list, but we have to do it.
It's part of the game.
Let's start taking them off.
Angel.
Oh, no.
I'm just gonna have to take off Bitch.
It's just not as rocking as the rest of them.
I wasn't too attached to that song being there.
I just kind of had to throw that in there.
Because, you know, I'm a bitch.
I would have.
Yeah, so, my turn to take something off.
This is tough, and I apologize, but I kinda got the question mark with this song, too, and maybe it's just because I'm uncultured.
I have to take Stargazer by Rainbow off the list.
I just, I'm sorry, Angel.
No, that's fine.
Um, I can send you the song later, and you're probably gonna, like, kill yourself later, because you'll be like, ah, why did I take that off?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
D&D Psy, Everlong
We have Highway to Hell by ACDC, Alive by Pearl Jam, Hey Man Nice Shot by Filter, Are You Gonna Go My Way by Lenny Kravitz, Master of Puppets by Metallica, Black Hole Sun by Soundgarden, More Human Than Human by White Zombie, and Song 2 by Blur.
Alright, send a private message to Sky with your vote.
And no bleached assholes!
You guys are fucked up.
Seriously.
Seriously fucked.
We have your roommate to blame for that, you know.
I know.
Bleached asshole.
Alright.
So we will reveal the definitive list a little later in the program.
And I will personally throw up on the doorstep of Red Octane if they ever put Korn or Slipknot in it.
Okay, Korn, I could deal with.
Korn's pretty cool until, like, until they hit MTV, Korn was very cool.
Like, Adidas, you know, All Day I Dream About... That was a cool song.
But, you know, when they kind of, you know, started being on MTV all the time, I didn't dig them so much.
But, no, Slipknot.
No, please, no.
Please, God, no.
However, Gwar would be awesome.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Primus.
See, all these... Winona's a big down beaver.
Winona's...
Oh my god, I forgot about that song.
That song was badass.
No, no, no.
My ex-boyfriend in Alabama was like the world's biggest Primus fan.
So we would go down his Civic MRX, play in Primus at like downtown Mobile and all the old people would wake up.
Or just the theme song to South Park.
All right, anyway.
So those votes are coming in there into the chat right now.
Let's talk a little bit real quick.
We are going to take a quick break so we can allow all the votes to come in.
However, I want to definitely plug some of the spin-off programming here on Orange Lounge Radio.
And we'll start it off with Monday nights on the station.
Extifer, who's not here tonight.
He's spending some quality family time.
His sister's over, and I think they're watching a movie.
So Extifer has his show on Monday nights.
It's Extifer's Case of the Mondays.
And...
It'll definitely clear up any Monday blahs that you were having with his very frank and honest talk.
And last week on the show, he had John on the show last week.
And John has nothing... John doesn't even play games, really, although I did catch him playing Final Fantasy VI once.
But, you know, it's the show where they kind of talk about games, but they talk about cool stuff, too.
So if you just want to have a good time, Monday nights on the station is extra first case of the Mondays.
Now, Tuesday nights is also a very good time.
Why is that, DarkSakura?
DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I read Fark's stories and Dig's stories too, okay?
Give me some credit.
But no, we have a good time.
I like my show.
It's fun.
So tune in Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday nights here on Orange Lounge Radio.
Thursdays and Fridays to come soon?
Maybe.
We'll see.
So, alright.
Any little comments?
Uh, maybe.
Maybe.
We'll see what happens.
Alright, so while we're finishing getting your votes, we would start the FUs of the week normally, but I don't want both those things to overlap each other with the private messages.
I can only handle so much.
So we're going to do a quick break, and then we're going to come back, reveal the winners of tonight's list list, and, so get those votes in now, and we're going to move into the FUs of the week, because I know y'all are angsty.
And DarkSakura has a new theme song for her FUs tonight, and I'll tell you what, it's probably the best damn FU theme song yet, I think.
It is, I forgot what I picked.
Well, you'll find out when we get back.
Or if you're nice, I'll tell you during the break.
So we'll be back after this.
In this break, I think what we're going to do is... You know, I had some people requesting this, even though we played it on last week's show.
This song is just so cool.
I don't know how you can not like this song.
So we have to give it its due.
And I apologize, though, because... Oh, shit.
If I can find it... Uh-oh.
We'll try to get to it during the break at some point.
I can't find it all of a sudden.
We'll be back.
How embarrassing is that?
Oh, well.
We'll try and get to that song, but in the meantime, you get some other songs.
We'll start it off with something from Ultramix 2, because we haven't played a lot of newer stuff tonight.
So we'll do an Ultramix 2 song, and we'll be back after this.
We're going to start it off with Toe Jam.
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
Thanks for watching!
Thanks for watching!
Thanks for watching!
This is not dead air, it's just that this song has a very quiet opening, so you'll just have to deal with it a little bit.
Thanks for watching!
Old New York was once New Amsterdam Why they changed it I can't say People just liked it better that way So take me back to Constantinople No you can't go back to Constantinople Been a long time gone Constantinople, why did Constantinople get the works?
That's what it is about the church
Old New York was once New Amsterdam Why they changed it, I can't say You just liked it better that way!
Istanbul was Constantinople, now it's Istanbul My Constantinople got a long time gone But Constantinople, why did Constantinople get the works?
That's nobody's business but the Turks
So take me back to Constantinople No you can't go back to Constantinople Been a long time gone to Constantinople Why did Constantinople get the works?
That's nobody's business but the church
Thanks for watching!
Thanks for watching!
Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.
Do we want to be staffed by Hollywood?
No!
Do we care what people think of us?
No!
Do we want people to kiss our ass?
Yes!
Extreme Bomani Radio.
That's us.
Orange Lounge Radio.
Alright, we're back in the list list.
We're about to reveal the definitive list as voted by you, the chatroom of the three songs you most want to see in Guitar Hero 2.
You guys ready for this?
What do you think won?
Any early guesses?
Apathetic people.
No Bleached Asshole Son?
Bleached Asshole Son.
We'll see.
Here we go.
Number three.
The number three pick you guys want to see in Guitar Hero 2.
Highway to Hell by ACDC.
Rock!
The number two song you most want to see in Listless.
Song 2 by Blurred.
Woohoo!
and then, yeah, literally, and the number one song you bitches wanna see in Guitar Hero 2 by a landslide, might I add, by a freaking landslide vote, Master of Puppets by Metallica.
I have the best taste in the whole freaking room.
I knew that would happen.
Yeah, by the way, all three on the list, yeah, those were all three of Jamie's picks.
Woo!
I bet the rest of us are wishing we knocked some of them out, huh?
Bitch.
Mine is an evil laugh.
You know what's funny is that it was in a different order.
So don't get too cocky over there.
Just only two songs were turned around.
This is because not everybody appreciates Blur the way I do.
Some other votes though too, you know, Are You Gonna Go My Way was a very, it was like a fourth, so you know, it wasn't all, it wasn't all Jamie.
DarkSakura, you changed your theme song yet again.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Murder!
Ah, this makes me feel mighty.
Um, my first FU goes toward migraines.
Yes, migraines.
Because it means that my brain is broken and they want me to go in for a CT scan.
An FU goes to the stuff they gave me to help with the slow, horrible migraines because, well, it makes me lightheaded and feel like I'm drunk without being drunk.
If I'm gonna feel drunk, I'll let the benefit of booze to feel drunk.
God.
An FU goes toward idiot drivers and people who decide to pull into my lane facing toward me.
Um, and Effie goes toward, uh, the McDonald's over here by Rob's house for being rather dumb.
You know what's funny is all three of us went there tonight.
I think that's hilarious.
And Effie to the ghetto family in front of me, because they really like ghetto.
Um...
A nephew toward me not having much time to do stuff.
Also a nephew to me not having the whole week to procrastinate on my homework.
So I have to do homework tonight, homework Monday, homework Wednesday, and get it all done before I leave Thursday.
But that means I get to enjoy myself all weekend.
An FU in Advance Tour to Grapevine before you get to L.A.
because that road is like crap.
And there'll probably be a forest fire or something stupid.
As there always is every time I go to L.A.
And then an FU to L.A.
freeway system in general because it sucks.
And the floating pockets of yellow smog that seem to be sentient.
Um, and an F you goes to my nose for draining into my throat, and I probably will have their guidance tomorrow.
Just thought I'd let everyone know.
Alright, I'm done.
Alright, Loki.
Anyways, um, first fuck you, McDonald's, for not being able to fill an order correctly.
I asked them for a two-cheeseburger meal.
Granted, I know that's not on their menu still, but it's still something that they offer, because I get it almost every day, at least every day this week, at the McDonald's that's by my house.
Fat Fatty McFatty.
Instead, they gave me this two McChicken meal thing, or two McChicken sandwiches and, like,
a medium fry and stuff, I'm like, um, no, this is not what I ordered, oh, well, we thought, we don't have a two cheeseburger meal, I'm like, well, where'd you get this two fucking McChicken thing, I don't even see McChicken on their fucking, maybe you should take the hint, that they're retarded, no, that's why I went back there and got my, my, uh, food, yeah, anyways, um, fuck you, the stupid people that are driving out there, it has,
I swear to God, you know, we're on the road today, and I see this dumb bitch, you know, she's kind of swerving in her lane.
It's because she's doing her fucking makeup and talking on a cell phone while driving on the freeway!
Dumb bitch!
You know what, that takes talent.
To do your makeup and talk on the cell phone and drive?
That's amazing.
She should have her hands cut off.
Back to the Babylonian days, all of a sudden.
Also, fuck you to Saw 2 for not being gory enough.
It was a very, you know, huge disappointment.
We passed for making movies.
Forget it.
What?
What?
Gory.
I don't want to give it away.
I didn't even see it, but I read all about it.
It sounded gross.
Anyways.
The opening sounded gross.
It wasn't gross.
It didn't show anything.
Whatever.
Anywho.
So, fuck that.
And then...
You know, fuck you Microsoft for potentially not allowing me to have a 360 on launch day, even though I pre-ordered mine way in advance and I have purchased games as well, um, that will be coming soon, so you know what, I will damn well, I better get my system, or heads will roll.
So.
That's it.
Heads will roll.
Alright, um, my FU time.
Whoops.
Sorry, I'm supposed to make it loud.
Ah, not that song, my song.
There we go.
I don't want no short dick man.
Alright.
Um, my FU's of the week.
FU to the fact that I feel like I'm getting sick.
Progressively throughout tonight's show, I felt my nose get more and more stuffy.
And a sore throat, which is not good when you're supposed to be talking for eight hours a day in front of people.
Uh-oh.
I'm gonna be fucked come next week.
It's a good thing I'm not in class tomorrow, otherwise I would cry.
but I get tomorrow off.
I'm making a stop by somewhere and getting coldies because coldies, the zinc brigade begins now.
Boomer, do not do more than 100 milligrams in a day or you can get zinc poisoning.
I know, I just, I'll keep it, that's gotta be like 10 of those drops though to get 100 milligrams.
Anyway, an F you to World of Warcraft for being all laggy, so I have to go buy more RAM, so either I'm getting an Xbox 360 or I'm getting more RAM.
But World of Warcraft is very pretty, I have to give it that.
My cameo wasn't that pretty.
More RAM.
Get more RAM.
For my World of Warcraft.
You're actually supporting my World of Warcraft addiction?
I guess, but RAM's good for everything.
It might be a benefit to show, too.
I'm having problems on the Rob Roberts show with the program I'm using, and I think it's because of a lack of RAM.
RAM's good.
RAM is very good.
I like RAM.
I guess that's enough.
F you to flu shots.
Because I miss them at my work, but not that I would get one anyway.
They swear up and down that flu shots do not make you sick.
I get sick every time I have a flu shot.
I know, it's total bullshit.
I always get sick whenever I get a flu shot.
I don't care what the doctor says.
That's time out for me.
You know, I get some time off work with a legitimate excuse.
If I'm not at work, it's an epidemic.
I mean, I don't mean to talk myself up, but damn.
I have to be there.
Anyway, let's move on to Angels FU of the Week.
And...
Well now hypothetically you could be bi.
I'm just kidding, I don't care.
I can't fire you, damn it!
Um, yeah, so, um, screw you because, um, no, I'm not, and neither are my friends, and neither are the two other people that were there with me that are also serving on this board, so you need to go find somebody, something else to do, rather, and, or get kicked out of the game, because I can get you to do that now, so bye!
And, um, FQ'd on having my computer break again, because that sucks.
Eh, I have to go fix that tonight.
Ah, other than that, I think I'm done.
Alright, let's go to the chatroom FUs and see what angst we have going on in chat tonight.
Nintendomaniac64 says, F you to Sky for not mentioning the pop vs soda argument like you said you would.
It's soda, there is no argument.
F you chat members for not commenting on my links I posted in chat.
F you guys for not mentioning the revolution in the Dreamcast Xbox 360 PS3 discussion.
Didn't Loki say it would be out?
You know, we would talk about the revolution if Nintendo would throw us a frickin' bone and give us more to talk about.
December 9th is when they're debuting some more info.
They said they're never going to show the games until they're actually playable.
Well then on December 9th is when we'll talk more about the revolution.
NintendoManiac64 says, F you to myself for doing certain illegal activities that involve games, emulators, and downloading.
Oh, did I just type that out to Skye?
Hee hee.
Actually, emulators are not illegal anymore.
There's a loophole that's basically stated that the emulators themselves are not illegal.
But the ROMs are.
Possibly, yes.
Roz says F you to my health teacher for telling the cast and crew of the play that we aren't allowed to turn on the stage lights anymore for practice because they use too much electricity.
Excuse me, that's stupid.
Goggle says F you to me for not calling in when I actually had something to say.
And F you to the AI in Soul Calibur 3 for being hard.
Seconded.
Seconded.
DarkSetsuya says a continued FU to Squeenix.
I was supposed to get my slime keychains and I haven't seen any sign of them.
SSJ100Matt says FU to my boss pulling in office space and making me come in Saturday and Sunday for senseless crap.
FU to my 4 year old Nvidia video card dying thus making me spend a whole $75 on a replacement.
But just remember, Friday is Hawaiian Shirt Day.
GS191...
That's a joke.
Get it?
Have you seen Office Space?
Yeah, that's right.
Forget it.
Actually, I also saw that movie with Yahoo Serious.
No, no, not him.
Carrot Top!
What does it mean with Carrot Top?
I don't know.
I don't watch any movies with Carrot Top in them.
I caught it because I had to watch it because it was an E3.
Can I do a tangent real quick?
Okay.
My coworker called and left a voicemail for my other coworker, and it was very hilarious.
I got to hear this too.
He used the soundboard from E-bombs World to leave this office space message saying, Yeah, we're going to need you to come in on Saturday.
Did you get the memo?
Really funny.
Really funny.
And so I'm going to call and leave him a Ms.
Cleo message.
Cleo Wednesday, that was it.
Yeah.
Luau Wednesday.
Luau Wednesday.
More, GS191 says F you to the Xbox 360 kiosk for crashing and giving me the black screen of death and F you to my online math class.
Well, it's nice to know some things in Microsoft never change.
Dark Knight says F you to a customer today at my job that went nuts today just because we wouldn't exchange her year old leaf blower for a new one because it broke down.
Jazz says, F you to the Xbox 360.
I saw a demo of you at Best Buy and you lagged more than my computer that was on the verge of its HD exploding.
Why must you keep making yourself look worse and worse?
LegendOfZaku says, F you to the asshole customers I have to put up with in my tech help desk job here on campus, thinking that they know how we do shit so they bitch and moan when we tell them that we don't go to people's dorms to fix their PCs.
In other words, they are too lazy to bring down their PC to our office for fixin'.
F you to Hollywood in general for drowning us with shitty remake movies.
You're unoriginal, so get off of your asses and give us some original shit.
LegoGuitar says, F you to anyone who sucks.
I'm in too much of a good mood to think of anything specific.
And lastly, Sakurina says, F you to me because I still haven't unlocked everything on EX2 because I suck.
And F you to Krista Berg for invading Quebec.
One more.
Ron Chan says, F you to my... I think it's boss, not booze.
F you to my boss who decided to show up at my house 30 minutes ago with my paycheck.
At least you got money out of it.
Alright.
Thank you for your angst, chatroom, you angsty, angsty individuals.
I want to mention, vote for us, a 5 in your player window, on your live 365 player window.
Your votes saying that we are a good station really helps us in getting the word out about Orange Lounge.
Also, be sure to visit PodcastAlley.com and Podcast.Yahoo.com and vote for our podcast there, because the more votes we get, the cooler we are.
There's actually a thread in our forums on OrangeLoungeRadio.com that says how you can help promote, and so we appreciate all the help that you guys give us.
One other thing I want to mention for you guys.
Oh!
I missed, I'm sorry, there's one more.
Shit!
There's one more FU here.
I better get to the music here.
MPQ says F you to Sony.
So you know about those retarded DRM CDs.
Yeah, it's not enough that they fuck up people's computers and not care about it.
Who knows what a rootkit is?
The dumbest thing is that this has nothing to do with piracy at all.
It's a pissing contest against Apple.
Yes, nothing to do with stopping piracy at all.
Sony's just pissed because the iPod's beating them.
Fuck you, Sony.
You're being fucking idiots.
And you lost my business.
Better late than never, right?
Alright.
I want to bring up something that was on the OrangeLoungeRadio.com website earlier this week.
I think this is kind of interesting.
Konami is launching a new campaign
I thought this was interesting.
They've launched a brand new website, and it's called Music in Every Direction.
And we're not really sure what the fuck this is supposed to be, but it is a promo device, absolutely, at least, for DDR Extreme 2, Karaoke Revolution Party, and DDR Ultramix 3.
And you can check this out.
It's musicineverydirection.com.
And all that's there right now are little bitty pictures.
of all those games, and enter your information below to stay up to date on the latest Konami music games and receive notification when the official website opens.
So I'm not sure, so I guess, oh, some people are saying they saw a commercial on TV, so is this like their marketing campaign, how they're going to market all these games?
Loki, you know anything about this?
You posted this to our website, so I thought maybe you'd know.
I didn't post this to our website.
I thought you did.
Who did?
Oh, damn it.
Copy that.
Something else.
Oh, well.
So I guess it's on TV.
I guess I don't watch enough TV because I haven't seen these commercials.
I haven't seen it either.
I didn't... During Elimidate, I saw the Guitar Hero with Loki and Dark Sakura commercial, but I did not see the commercial.
Yeah, anyway.
Oh, goody.
I'm just waiting for that.
I know they're going to... You know who I'm buying Guitar Hero with?
Hmm.
My best buy bucks from McDonald's.
Hell yes.
I have $31 of that stuff now.
Interesting.
Plus $15 from the puppies, because I bought all three of them and they gave me the file.
Yeah, I only have to pay like three bucks for the whole thing.
Not bad, not bad.
Alright, now I'm curious, what the fuck is this website you're on?
Because it's moving by itself.
It's like, it's a ghost thing.
It looks like fridge magnet poetry.
What the fuck is this site you're on?
Oh, this is nothing.
This is just some retarded viral campaign that no one cares about for the 360 that it has.
Okay, I can sum this up the best way.
It's like people were talking about, you know when Isle of Bees came out and stuff, that was cool because viral campaigning was kind of unseen and alternate reality gaming was kind of like brand new.
Now when everybody does it, it's not cool anymore.
So, remember Hex 168 came out, that 360 site?
Well, hexadecimal of 168 is 360.
This right here in binary is 360, and then there's this stupid thing that you go and type and stuff, and basically you can type in this, and there's little binary things, and there's a countdown, which, by the way, ends on the 15th, I want to say, at, I believe, 7 p.m.
Pacific time, wherever the hell that's supposed to be.
But anyways,
Um, so there's this thing, if you type in play in that, it takes you to this other screen, where I think there's these, all these things, and basically everyone's like, oh my god, you know, it's, it's some, you know, puzzle, we have to figure it out.
No, actually, you just type this stuff in, and other people type stuff, and they respond back to you, and
All that stuff, and these can all move around.
What, the chat room?
It's sort of a chat room.
Are people actually moving those?
Yeah, people are moving these.
Like, right now, I'm going to move a bunch of these at random.
And piss people off, because people are trying to, like, you know, type stuff in here.
And so I am moving them around to piss them off.
I'm going to type poop and we're going to see if that appears.
No, actually, see there's Firefly.
Someone just typed that earlier.
I was doing this the other day.
I kept typing Orange Lounge Radio over and over and over again just for the fuck of it because it'll actually appear at one point because you've typed it in so many times.
But, um...
So we'll just see if we can get this up here.
Alright, have fun with it.
What's the website for that again?
The website for this is www.101101000.com slash zero.
Yeah, good luck remembering that.
Can you post that in chat, please?
Meanwhile, we're going to go back to the Skype line because I promised some folks we'd go to the Skype line a little later in the show.
And wouldn't you know it, we already have a call.
Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Hey, what's up?
It's Ranma.
Hey, Ronchan, how are you?
Hello!
Hey, hi everybody, I'm Jamie.
What's on your mind?
Not much, I just want to touch upon a couple of things.
Xbox 360, if you're going to get one, I would suggest if you're on the Best Buy, I would get there about, oh, say, 5, 6 p.m.
That's crazy talk.
I was there for the PSP.
I got there at 7 a.m.
to take pictures.
There were people there at 6 a.m.
Now, you also live in New York City, though, so... Yeah.
All right.
No, no, no, no.
This is where I was living in the suburbs.
I was in the city there.
This was the suburbs where my desk might open up at 10.
There were people there at 7.
We opened so early just to sell the PSP's.
Okay, we're having kind of a hard time understanding you, Ran Chan, so you're kind of coming through really blurry.
Also, Rob has suddenly developed an accent.
I did?
Okay.
What did I say?
Understand.
Whatever.
Whatever.
Okay, so Ran Chan, you want to tell us really quick about some Nintendo event you went to?
Yeah, I went to the Nintendo World DDR Mario Mix Contest.
And what happened?
People got screwed.
They had everything developed in different colors.
And the topic that we covered was that.
But what happened was, they only did it for two rounds.
After that, every time, the top six get to advance.
Basically about 30, 20 people got screwed out of tournament.
Aw, it's a bummer, but I guess that's going to happen in probably one of the bigger cities or something.
Anyway, Ranchen, since you're kind of breaking up, I am going to have to let you go, but we hope we can talk to you again soon, a little later, okay?
Take care.
Later!
Okay, well, I think what he said there was about the DDR with Mario event at the official Nintendo Store.
It sounds like people got screwed out of it somehow after only a couple rounds.
That's too bad.
Loki, you were saying you got Orange Lounge to appear on the site, and it looks like everybody's moving things to the corners now.
Yeah, see, there's Orange Lounge right here.
I'm holding it, and I'm shaking it around.
That's great.
so our listeners are all on there just shuffling shit into all the corners beautiful God I love our listeners I so so love them
Another call on Skype line.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Obviously, I don't need any introduction.
Not at this point, Mr. Zaku.
What's on your mind?
Just a comment on the little DDR Mario mix thing.
The reason why people were getting screwed over is because, you know, it's Nintendo World's fault.
You know, I squarely put the blame on Nintendo World for the fact that they didn't go to DDR Freak or any of those sites to advertise the tournament.
So they suck.
Yeah, but you know, the whole DDR Mario Mix pretty much, you know, that whole tournament thing, you know, is a joke.
Okay, well DDR Mario Mix is a joke anyway, too.
So what I'm curious about, Saku, what's the latest on MTV?
Because you're going to be rich and famous, right?
Yeah, I got the email.
They sent me an email last Thursday.
I've already replied to them.
They're going to be filming next Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
Hopefully, I should be able to make it next Wednesday if I get more information from them.
And then a week after that, during MTV's Gaming Week, a.k.a.
the Xbox 360 Launch Week, they will air it.
If you can somehow get Orange Lounge in there, whether it be like a picture in the background, or you know, your name dropping it, or somehow Orange Lounge gets in there, I will... Dude, if you send me an OLR shirt, I will marry.
Seriously.
If you would make me an extra large shirt that says, in black, that says Orange Lounge Radio on it, I would definitely wear that shirt out.
Damn it.
Maybe, I don't know if we can get it done in time.
But, I'll send you a dollar.
Also, 1UP.com is saying that Beatmania is being pushed up early to the 15th of February of next year.
I do not know of any changes inside Konami as far as I know.
Well, I know what 1UP.com is saying, but I don't agree with it.
We'll see.
We'll see.
Maybe.
I could see it getting bumped up, but as far as I know, it's not done yet, so we'll see.
All right.
Well, Zachary, we're going to let you go.
Just do whatever.
Just see if you could try to send me a shirt or something.
I seriously would allow you to use me as a billboard or some sort of advertising.
We want to do the shirt thing so bad, but it's just a cost issue.
Or something like that.
All right.
All right, Zachary, we're going to let you go, okay?
Have a good one.
You know, just think about it, man.
I know.
We'll get it.
All right.
Take care.
Later.
All right, just so you know.
What's going on now on the site?
We've got like tons of people on the desk.
It's really funny.
The name of the page, the title, it is 101101000 and then colon, it's so much fun.
What?
Somebody actually put it so much fun on there?
No, I think it just, I don't know how it appeared on there, but...
It just says it's so much fun.
That's great.
So I gotta watch this.
What is going on here?
So everybody's on the site just like shuffling around.
Zombie butts.
I love Ross.
Goat say love.
Orange love Japan.
No you don't, you fucker.
That was great.
Jamie's fighting with somebody.
Whoever keeps touching orange rounds, stop.
I'm trying to get me on there, but...

I have some thoughts about the Xbox 360 and everything.
Please, tell us your thoughts on the Xbox 360.
I saw it at Best Buy, and it looked like crap.
And what?
It looked like crap.
What was wrong with it?
It was really laggy.
They were playing King Kong, and everything was running at 15 FPS at that.
It looked like me playing Final Fantasy XI in lower Juno.
Yeah, basically.
It was really bad.
I was like, damn, this is what everybody's worked it up about.
So needless to say, you're not going to be buying an Xbox 360?
Not at the moment, no.
Nuh-uh.
I'm going to stick with my ghetto, broken-down Xbox for now.
I know what he's going to do instead.
What?
What?
What did you just buy last week?
Hint, nudge, elbow.
Uh, Star Hero?
No!
You bought one month of what?
Oh!
Light goes on.
Here, World of Warcraft.
I know, I got sucked in for another month.
Congratulations on that, by the way.
I know.
Man, I wasn't even home for five minutes last week.
What server are you on?
Uh... Yeah, I'm not telling it on air, but yeah.
I think it's great.
I think it's leaps and bounds better than Guitar Freaks ever was.
Just because of the fact that it's not all Richard J-pop, and I think that appeals a lot more to people.
Besides that, yeah, it's a great game.
Yeah, it's definitely different than Guitar Freaks, certainly a different song list, and it's going to appeal to a whole different audience.
All right, well, Jazz, we've got to go because we've got to wrap up the show, but thanks so much for calling in, okay?
All right, bye.
All right, later.
Bye.
All right, that's going to do it for our Skype calls tonight.
Okay, now's the part of the show where we're going to go around and get everybody's final thoughts because it's that time of the show where we're almost done.
So we're going to start it off by going over to Angel.
Angel, what is your final thought of the evening?
Must buy Guitar Hero.
Anyway, Loki.
I lost where my name went on this page.
Oh, there we are.
Whoa, I have like three names on there now.
It says Loki as goats say.
Awesome.
My final thought is ciabatta bread is yummy.
It's my favorite thing ever.
And DarkSakura, your final thought.
Rejectable cyclones.
Somebody send me to London.
All right, that's going to do it for tonight's show.
Tune in next week.
Tune into the podcast as well.
Next week, the one and only DarkSakura will not be here, sadly, because she'll be glamming it up at the podcast awards.
I'll represent if Jamie lets me grin.
If I get my way, we'll have a whole orgy of people here, because DarkSakura's chair is not an easy one to fill, so we'll have to get like five people to all sit in it at the same time, naked.
