You're tuned in to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition,

00:09.600 --> 00:13.900
your podcast home for all the latest video game news and gamer chat.

00:13.900 --> 00:17.800
Now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Skye, and Logan.

00:18.900 --> 00:24.100
Hello, everybody. Once again, welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio To Go,

00:24.100 --> 00:28.000
that podcast dedicated to what you gamers really want to know about.

00:28.000 --> 00:31.600
And you know we like to talk about video games that don't suck on this show

00:31.780 --> 00:37.920
Although sometimes we will talk about games that do suck, but only to tell you to stay far far away avoid like the plague

00:39.380 --> 00:42.580
Say hello to oh my name is Rob Roberts. You might know me as sky

00:42.580 --> 00:47.220
I should introduce myself, and then I'll introduce the co-host we have over there sitting next to me Loki. Yes

00:47.220 --> 00:53.580
I'm here all right and joining us on skype line tonight. Say hello to dark Sakura. Hi. How are you doing?

00:53.580 --> 01:00.540
I know what happened. Did you did you catch something from Adam curry at the podcast Awards or what happened?

01:00.740 --> 01:03.500
No, I was already sick when I was there

01:04.020 --> 01:07.940
Apparently I had a cold turned into a sinus infection

01:08.260 --> 01:12.860
LA made it worse and now I have a pretty nasty case of bronchitis

01:13.700 --> 01:18.940
This it's like God doesn't want you to be on this show or something. I don't know what the hell's going on Darcy

01:18.940 --> 01:24.300
Sakura it happens every every time this year I tend to get some type of

01:24.300 --> 01:28.360
respiratory illness but last year I didn't get it and I think it was just

01:28.360 --> 01:34.060
because I lost all that weight the year before mm-hmm and this year it's like

01:34.060 --> 01:39.420
hi you remember me I'm back let's give you pneumonia now it's just a healthy me

01:39.420 --> 01:46.500
for pneumonia it's just a healthy la air well real quick how was the podcast

01:46.500 --> 01:52.860
awards it was we weren't there for very long Julie went with me I said you know

01:52.860 --> 01:59.060
she's a helps us out sometimes oh yeah and if I actually let me real quick let

01:59.060 --> 02:01.760
me say there are a lot of folks behind the scenes that help us out with a lot

02:01.760 --> 02:05.340
of things that sometimes don't get their due credit especially Jason oh my god

02:05.340 --> 02:09.440
we'd be dead in the water without Jason so thank you to Jason and Julie and Jess

02:09.440 --> 02:12.700
over at DDR freak and just everybody who helps us out behind the scenes and

02:12.700 --> 02:17.640
doesn't get their credit sometimes so anyway Julie kept my road rage down to a

02:17.640 --> 02:24.020
minimum on the trip which there was plenty of that hmm that was your words

02:24.020 --> 02:28.500
themselves the ceremony itself it was sort of like let's give it everybody on

02:28.500 --> 02:32.240
stage give him the thing get off only the people who win the big prizes get to

02:32.240 --> 02:37.620
talk and I got to see Adam Curry who looks a lot more handsome now than he

02:37.620 --> 02:45.740
did in his MTV days all right all right met some cool people I met Frank from

02:45.740 --> 02:51.060
the overnight scape mm-hmm I haven't had a chance yet to check out his podcast

02:51.060 --> 02:57.020
is basically I came back to homework yeah right yeah actually I came back to

02:57.020 --> 03:02.140
homework and then getting sick again so I went to the doctor soon I got back so

03:02.140 --> 03:05.260
leading into our next topic how was your gaming week I imagine you probably

03:05.260 --> 03:10.100
haven't gotten a lot of gaming done actually I can say that the last weekend

03:10.100 --> 03:17.620
was pretty much taken up by a fantasy store online all right for the Xbox

03:17.620 --> 03:21.500
there was a lot of that going around are there still a lot of people on there

03:21.500 --> 03:29.580
apparently so yeah but uh the guy that we stayed with he was busy playing that

03:29.580 --> 03:34.900
and then Julie was showing him blue burst so we had some blue burst going on

03:34.900 --> 03:38.620
cool it's kind of glad I didn't uninstall it off my laptop because they

03:38.620 --> 03:46.780
used that version and actually the theme for my house has been a need for speed

03:46.780 --> 03:53.300
underground most wanted which looks kind of pretty I'm reserving my judgment for

03:53.300 --> 03:59.700
the Xbox 360 version when it's out it's but you know right now on it just looks

03:59.700 --> 04:04.740
kind of and it's got lots of prettiness going on and lots of destructiveness

04:04.740 --> 04:10.280
going on but I've kind of had my fill of watching that game unfortunately a 360

04:10.280 --> 04:14.340
versions only a port so it's only a little bit better and I hear that

04:14.340 --> 04:19.900
they've got some really bad loading like choppiness in it so hmm I guess that I'm

04:19.900 --> 04:24.620
gonna reserve my judgment for actually seeing it we'll see all right um so is

04:24.620 --> 04:29.080
that all you pretty much have your gaming week yeah that's pretty much it

04:29.080 --> 04:33.840
I've had this copy of Mario Kart DS sitting on my computer desk now for a

04:33.840 --> 04:38.720
week you got to open that thing soon it's awesome it's open it's sitting

04:38.720 --> 04:43.640
there just hasn't been in my DS yet gets get some use out of that this

04:43.640 --> 04:49.600
Thanksgiving it's great all right Loki how was your gaming week my week was

04:49.600 --> 04:54.100
filled with Shadow Colossus, which is fun. Haven't really gotten anything.

04:54.100 --> 04:55.100
Haven't you beaten that yet?

04:55.100 --> 04:57.100
No, I haven't really been playing it.

04:57.100 --> 05:03.100
Mainly Mario Kart DS. I've been pounding out, trying to get Rob unlocked.

05:03.100 --> 05:05.100
I have to beat the entire game for that.

05:05.100 --> 05:07.100
Not me, Rob, but Rob the Robot.

05:07.100 --> 05:11.100
Rob the Robot, yeah. And it's pretty cool, and the online stuff is pretty fun.

05:11.100 --> 05:17.100
It does take a little time to get people to play online, especially if you're trying to find your friends online.

05:17.100 --> 05:23.600
Because I wish they had a way to kind of like aim or something like that where you can see who's online on your friends list or something like that.

05:23.600 --> 05:29.600
But they don't have that so oh well. Or like some sort of lobby system where they have like a chat room or something. That'd be cool.

05:29.600 --> 05:37.600
Other than that, not too much. I've been just checking out a lot of videos of the 360 stuff coming out. I bought two 360 games.

05:37.600 --> 05:47.600
So I technically played AMP 3 and Call of Duty 2, I played the Let's Unwrap the Shrink Wrap and Look at the Manual and that was it.

05:47.600 --> 05:51.600
You're crazy. Why did you do that? Just because you wanted to get in on this hype?

05:51.600 --> 05:54.600
No, because I'm getting the system when it comes out.

05:54.600 --> 05:56.600
But that might not be until January at this point.

05:56.600 --> 05:58.600
I don't think so. I really don't.

05:58.600 --> 05:59.600
You're still convinced you're getting it Tuesday, huh?

05:59.600 --> 06:04.600
I'm not sure if I'm getting it Tuesday, but I know I'm not getting it after Christmas like they say.

06:04.600 --> 06:08.340
Yeah, it seems like I don't believe that they're gonna be that long

06:08.340 --> 06:11.140
I mean cuz what's the big deal the if you you know?

06:11.140 --> 06:16.700
Hype this system up as the big thing for Christmas and you don't ship anymore. That's kind of retarded. Yeah, I agree

06:18.300 --> 06:20.220
Huh

06:20.220 --> 06:28.020
Yeah, but you see you have that lucky thing of being very close with a GameStop employee that can manage to get you one, right?

06:28.980 --> 06:30.420
Yeah

06:30.420 --> 06:34.340
Yeah, that's my actually I had something else about my gaming week. Oh, what's that?

06:36.220 --> 06:41.660
My extreme amounts of giddiness after finding out that Kingdom Hearts 2 is having a Tron

06:42.460 --> 06:47.100
Thing. Oh, I know we talked about that briefly on last week's show. That's amazing

06:48.580 --> 06:54.900
Also the new trailer show Steamboat Willie's gonna be another level that's in that as well as Leelo and stitch

06:54.900 --> 07:01.100
yep I saw that actually I am I knew that because they had it at the e3 demo so

07:01.100 --> 07:07.100
it's gonna you've got stitch there but I also played a good bit of it at e3 too

07:07.100 --> 07:10.140
because I have all my pictures up the game just looks sexy that's all it is

07:10.140 --> 07:19.100
and the it's it's out on Japanese sites there's the the demo reel for Final

07:19.100 --> 07:24.780
Fantasy 12 which is looking pretty hot some folks here have that now because

07:24.780 --> 07:27.960
Dragon Quest 8 I haven't gotten to check it out myself yet but I've heard it's

07:27.960 --> 07:29.800
pretty darn good

07:29.800 --> 07:32.180
too bad the game might be getting delayed again you know that's a rumor

07:32.180 --> 07:35.880
going around right now that games getting delayed again surprising they

07:35.880 --> 07:37.440
said for sure

07:37.440 --> 07:42.040
March 2006 in Japan March and now they're saying up maybe maybe not

07:42.640 --> 07:46.640
let's see the thing about the final fantasy games I've noticed though is

07:46.640 --> 07:51.300
that the u.s. versions are almost always worth waiting for because they add more

07:51.300 --> 07:57.300
stuff. Yeah a little bit. And then it gets re-released as an international version and blah blah blah blah blah.

07:57.300 --> 08:06.300
What I'm kind of waiting for, you know, and this is really, every time I see Kingdom Hearts 2, I keep thinking, you know, back to Super Mario RPG.

08:06.300 --> 08:12.300
That was one of the coolest things where you have Square teaming up with Nintendo to make a really kick-ass RPG. They really need to do that again.

08:12.300 --> 08:16.920
again just with all their franchises kind of make a new RPG and make it

08:16.920 --> 08:22.360
really cool it like Paper Mario is no excuse for an RPG this is not a sequel

08:22.360 --> 08:26.940
to the Super Mario RPG it's a poor excuse is what it is but I don't know

08:26.940 --> 08:29.620
that's what I'm waiting for I'll keep waiting I'm sure

08:29.620 --> 08:35.880
alright enough fantasy Smash Brothers Final Fantasy Edition you guys look you

08:35.880 --> 08:40.980
guys have some crazy comedy already got her gets oh that's true anyway that's

08:40.980 --> 08:46.920
just Final Fantasy 7 no we need like like full-on Smash Brothers trial with

08:46.920 --> 08:54.060
you know different like lock in one and radio yeah absolutely all right my

08:54.060 --> 08:57.900
gaming week um let's see I also have been playing an awful lot of Mario Kart

08:57.900 --> 09:01.740
DS it really is that good I haven't been into a Mario Kart game probably since

09:01.740 --> 09:06.140
maybe the 64 really so much though the Super Nintendo one is really where the

09:06.140 --> 09:10.980
old school this is that I love it and I love this new one for the DS you know

09:10.980 --> 09:13.980
for some reason the GameCube one the formula was just off I didn't care for

09:13.980 --> 09:18.820
the GameCube one and the the Game Boy one that they had previous just it

09:18.820 --> 09:21.700
wasn't the same it really wasn't I don't know what what to say but it wasn't the

09:21.700 --> 09:25.340
same but this one is great it it controls pretty good considering you

09:25.340 --> 09:29.780
know it's got you know the d-pad and everything and the game runs great it's

09:29.780 --> 09:34.580
a very simple engine it plays much like it was the old Super Nintendo one I love

09:34.580 --> 09:38.200
I love the fact that they included the retro tracks, the wireless features are

09:38.200 --> 09:40.280
great and the fact that it goes online

09:40.280 --> 09:44.620
is even awesome as well. Now granted that's probably the game's strongest and

09:44.620 --> 09:46.100
weakest points because

09:46.100 --> 09:49.180
Nintendo's never really been online with their games before

09:49.180 --> 09:52.580
so that for that it's a strong point because like OMG you know we got a

09:52.580 --> 09:55.620
DS game that's finally online but at the same time, eh,

09:55.620 --> 09:58.700
lots that could be improved with it. In fact

09:58.700 --> 10:04.100
we're hearing at least we kinda got word this week that Nintendo is banning you

10:04.100 --> 10:07.700
from sharing your friend code on their forums. You're not allowed on Nintendo's

10:07.700 --> 10:09.300
forums to actually share your own friend code.

10:09.300 --> 10:12.020
And I think the reason why they're trying to do that is they're wanting to

10:12.020 --> 10:13.060
make sure that

10:13.060 --> 10:16.620
people on your friends list are actually your friends. And not that they could

10:16.620 --> 10:18.420
stop me from posting on another forum,

10:18.420 --> 10:21.960
but I think that's very interesting that they are really, really being careful with

10:21.960 --> 10:23.960
this online stuff. Like they don't want

10:23.960 --> 10:27.540
to have that story in the news about, you know,

10:27.540 --> 10:32.700
little girl meets old pervert on Nintendo game and on Animal Crossing.

10:32.700 --> 10:36.660
Yeah, I was gonna say, well in Mario Kart, they can't really communicate anyway, so it's

10:36.660 --> 10:37.660
like retarded.

10:37.660 --> 10:38.780
That's why I thought it was weird, because you can't really communicate in Mario Kart

10:38.780 --> 10:42.540
anyway, which is kind of one of its downfalls, is that you can't do anything, you can't use

10:42.540 --> 10:45.300
the microphone to chat, you can't write, talk, or anything.

10:45.300 --> 10:48.060
Oh my god, that would be so bad.

10:48.060 --> 10:52.860
So I don't know, but it's just cool that it's online at all, I mean honestly, and the fact

10:52.860 --> 10:58.220
that it runs with no lag online is incredible, there's nothing short of incredible.

10:58.220 --> 11:02.700
the way you set up the games and the other stuff kind of around that I don't

11:02.700 --> 11:06.140
know it feels maybe a little bit rushed so maybe it could have been polished a

11:06.140 --> 11:08.660
little more and I'm hoping like when we get some more of these games like

11:08.660 --> 11:12.860
Metroid Animal Crossing maybe we'll see that front end for the thing Wi-Fi be a

11:12.860 --> 11:17.700
little better my peeve with that game is the whole battle mode I don't get it I

11:17.700 --> 11:22.060
don't get it at all and I love the battle mode in the Super Nintendo game I

11:22.060 --> 11:27.360
I love the battle mode in the Nintendo 64 game.

11:27.360 --> 11:29.620
I didn't get it with GameCube.

11:29.620 --> 11:34.780
Their battle mode was crap because their arenas were crap and I don't even think the Game

11:34.780 --> 11:36.980
Boy Advance version had battle mode.

11:36.980 --> 11:40.020
But it's just this one's pretty cool.

11:40.020 --> 11:42.260
I just don't get how to blow up the other balloons.

11:42.260 --> 11:46.880
My other minor minor bitch besides that would be maybe some of the other mechanics in the

11:46.880 --> 11:47.880
actual racing.

11:47.880 --> 11:51.380
It does seem like it favors, and I know that Mario Kart is supposed to do this where like

11:51.380 --> 11:53.700
like if you're in last place you get the really good items and when you're in

11:53.700 --> 11:58.320
first place you get the not-so-great items it seems to really favor like

11:58.320 --> 12:01.700
last place like over first place like almost too much like it's kind of skewed

12:01.700 --> 12:05.420
again though that's a real minor minor complaint I still highly highly

12:05.420 --> 12:08.820
recommend Mario Kart DS I think it's a great title especially if you've loved

12:08.820 --> 12:13.600
any of the other Mario Kart titles so I give it my highest recommendation also

12:13.600 --> 12:17.460
what I got to play this week Dance Dance Revolution Ultra Mix 3 of course Orange

12:17.460 --> 12:20.260
Lounge Radio started all about music video games of course I have to check

12:20.260 --> 12:25.860
all the new ones when they come out ddr ultra mix 3 my only it's a good game

12:25.860 --> 12:30.180
it's a solid game I do recommend it for fans of ddr for people that are just

12:30.180 --> 12:33.700
getting into it I can only give it about a borderline recommendation because I

12:33.700 --> 12:37.100
think ddr Ultramix 2 was better I think the formula for how they were picking

12:37.100 --> 12:40.300
the songs was better and it's kind of one of those things was like if it ain't

12:40.300 --> 12:44.340
broke don't fix it and Konami kind of really went crazy with some of their

12:44.340 --> 12:49.780
song pics they have some like stuff that sounds like I don't even know I they

12:49.780 --> 12:51.020
just have like they're trying to do

12:51.020 --> 12:53.380
homages to these bands but does that

12:53.380 --> 12:55.300
mean that they're good stuff to dance to

12:55.300 --> 12:57.340
I don't know see I think they made some

12:57.340 --> 12:59.380
really odd picks like Ray Charles and

12:59.380 --> 13:01.100
the clash and stuff I mean although

13:01.100 --> 13:03.160
those are great songs I don't think they

13:03.160 --> 13:06.260
make for good DDR songs so that kind of

13:06.260 --> 13:08.020
ruins the game for me in that aspect and

13:08.020 --> 13:10.540
plus just the fact that the song packs

13:10.540 --> 13:12.740
that you bought on UltraMix 2 do not

13:12.740 --> 13:14.580
function correctly not all the songs

13:14.580 --> 13:17.060
work right in UltraMix 3 so it's kind of

13:17.060 --> 13:19.460
one of those you know I bought these

13:19.460 --> 13:22.760
thinking they'd work and all the future DDRs and now they don't that kind of

13:22.760 --> 13:27.260
sucks because it's all miss synced so that's kind of a complaint but I will

13:27.260 --> 13:31.160
say to the game's credit Xbox Live features are marvelous the steps to all

13:31.160 --> 13:34.960
the games are really good even those songs that aren't so great and there are

13:34.960 --> 13:38.180
some really good songs on there as well and in fact later in the show we're

13:38.180 --> 13:41.300
gonna be talking to one of the musicians who did some of the really good music

13:41.300 --> 13:44.860
in UltraMix 3 we're gonna talk to Midihead a little later on in the show

13:44.860 --> 13:50.320
but first let's get to some gaming news and I'll go ahead and let Dark Sakura

13:50.320 --> 13:55.720
start off Dark Sakura we love Katamari and I understand you got some news about

13:55.720 --> 14:01.180
the next in creation of Katamari actually it's called me and my Katamari I

14:01.180 --> 14:08.200
think that's a cute name okay looking at the pictures that are online right now

14:08.200 --> 14:14.840
the game looks actually very fabulous I mean it looks top-notch for the PSP

14:14.840 --> 14:21.080
however the control from what I understand though is supposed to be

14:21.080 --> 14:30.720
pretty much crappy and I can understand that without having both analog on it I

14:30.720 --> 14:36.480
mean imagine you're going from a from a game where basically you've got two

14:36.480 --> 14:41.000
handed control to trying to control it with one hand it's not gonna work so are

14:41.000 --> 14:44.080
they gonna do it with the one analog and the buttons or what are they gonna do

14:44.080 --> 14:49.300
I haven't seen too much into it however there are some good features that I

14:49.300 --> 14:54.800
think might make up for that. Like what? Wireless play for up to four people.

14:54.800 --> 15:02.040
Cool. You've got the prince and the cousins there's old and new. You've got

15:02.040 --> 15:08.320
customization options, more masks, more headgear, the ability to wear them

15:08.320 --> 15:15.680
various places a new island interface that highlights players your options in

15:15.680 --> 15:22.600
different stages represented by animals needs in new homes there's actually the

15:22.600 --> 15:31.220
information for it is up at katamari.namco.com okay but there's also a

15:31.220 --> 15:39.780
photos up on this actually quite a number of photos at worth playing.com

15:39.780 --> 15:47.360
which actually was this particular link was also emailed to us by one of our our

15:47.360 --> 15:51.380
listeners. Awesome well thank you listener for sharing the LAist

15:51.380 --> 15:56.780
developments on me and my Katamari. Now we know what they're

15:56.780 --> 16:00.580
officially gonna call it here in the US because previously we just knew

16:00.580 --> 16:05.860
my my Katamari was like the Japanese translation so it's kind of nice to hear

16:05.860 --> 16:09.580
that you know it's it's gonna have a name here in the US that actually makes

16:09.580 --> 16:14.940
a little more sense so that's nice to hear all right moving on I got another

16:14.940 --> 16:22.180
story for you guys and this has to do with World of Warcraft as you know it's

16:22.180 --> 16:26.300
released into other countries now it just recently went over into Asia other

16:26.300 --> 16:30.260
parts of there what's interesting the game rolled out in China not that long

16:30.260 --> 16:35.680
ago and unfortunately they've had a bit of an incident there a 13 year old

16:35.680 --> 16:41.200
Chinese boy actually jumped to their death from a 24-story building from

16:41.200 --> 16:44.780
playing too much World of Warcraft now that's not the new thing okay that

16:44.780 --> 16:48.140
happened after it rolled out last year that actually happened last year this is

16:48.140 --> 16:54.260
the new part the parents of the boy are now suing Blizzard saying they actually

16:54.260 --> 16:59.900
got a lawyer and quote internet game addiction researcher and they are

16:59.900 --> 17:04.020
filing the suits upon the whole game industry on behalf of parents

17:04.020 --> 17:08.640
interesting the question is how liable should game companies be when their kids

17:08.640 --> 17:14.420
OD on the gaming does World of Warcraft feature jumping out of buildings no I

17:14.420 --> 17:18.720
don't know if that's what they're saying so much for some kid that jump out of a

17:18.720 --> 17:24.220
building because he was addicted to a game okay I don't see how that works if

17:24.220 --> 17:29.380
I'm addicted to alcohol I don't jump out of a window hmm I go drink more alcohol

17:29.380 --> 17:39.560
okay I don't get it all right so just kind of I don't know it's it's too bad

17:39.560 --> 17:44.560
but it's interesting to hear that the the lawsuit crazy stuff doesn't just

17:44.560 --> 17:49.200
happen in the u.s. because that story is coming out of China so go figure Loki

17:49.200 --> 17:53.800
you got something for us those crazy Chinese in their games they're always

17:53.800 --> 17:58.360
killing somebody where you have something related to that no I don't I

17:58.360 --> 18:08.600
Well, this year's Spike Awards, or their video game awards, the results have been posted

18:08.600 --> 18:11.360
because we like to spoil everybody's stuff.

18:11.360 --> 18:15.440
If you don't want it spoiled, turn down your volume for about a minute.

18:15.440 --> 18:16.440
Yeah, exactly.

18:16.440 --> 18:21.760
Anyways, game of the year, Resident Evil 4, which is interesting.

18:21.760 --> 18:25.040
Best action game, God of War.

18:25.040 --> 18:27.120
No surprise there.

18:27.120 --> 18:32.080
sports title of course Tony Hawk's American Wasteland and then they have

18:32.080 --> 18:38.300
some really strange stuff best cyber vixen of the year some chick from 007

18:38.300 --> 18:46.640
from Russia would love one I thought was pretty cool was best soundtrack well

18:46.640 --> 18:50.180
they have guitar hero was best soundtrack but best original score we

18:50.180 --> 18:56.020
love katamari which is really cool but then what's kind of interesting is they

18:56.020 --> 19:01.940
have a whole bunch of games winning awards that aren't even out yet like

19:01.940 --> 19:06.580
Peter Jackson's King Kong the official game of the movie it's not out yet what

19:06.580 --> 19:12.580
did it win it won um let's see here best performance by a human male

19:12.580 --> 19:19.220
Debbie Jack Black and Peter Jackson's King Kong it also won let's see here

19:19.220 --> 19:25.700
best cast well the game actually be out by the time this airs I'm not sure if

19:25.700 --> 19:29.580
It comes out on Tuesday, so then yeah, it'll be out by the time this airs

19:29.580 --> 19:32.800
I don't think this airs till like the first week of December or something so yeah

19:32.800 --> 19:37.380
So then they have best RPG World of Warcraft best PC game World of Warcraft

19:39.240 --> 19:44.140
Best handheld game luminous, which I thought was pretty cool well-deserved now um

19:44.900 --> 19:49.540
Resident Evil 4 being the game of the year there. I think I could see that you know

19:49.540 --> 19:52.340
It may not be my favorite game this year, but damn

19:52.340 --> 19:57.140
it was a real sharp looking game really innovative and just the graphics were

19:57.140 --> 20:01.020
amazing and I could see I could see Resident Evil 4 walking away with that

20:01.020 --> 20:06.060
it makes more sense to me than some of the other awards that I see shows give

20:06.060 --> 20:10.180
for game of the year sometimes so I'm okay with that what were some of the

20:10.180 --> 20:13.860
other nominees do they list the nominees or just um I forget who else the

20:13.860 --> 20:17.540
nominees for game of the year we also have some other best supporting male

20:17.540 --> 20:21.240
performance Christopher Walken in true crime New York City of course and of

20:21.240 --> 20:27.520
And of course, also best supporting female performance, also won by Tracy Lords in True

20:27.520 --> 20:28.520
Crime New York City.

20:28.520 --> 20:29.520
Go figure.

20:29.520 --> 20:30.800
Alright, what were the other nominees for Game of the Year?

20:30.800 --> 20:37.160
Game of the Year, the other nominees, we had God of War, definitely deserving, Call of

20:37.160 --> 20:44.440
Duty 2, also very deserving game, World of Warcraft, also very deserving, and Fear, all

20:44.440 --> 20:45.440
very good games.

20:45.440 --> 20:48.360
See, I'm kind of surprised World of Warcraft didn't walk away with it, honestly, just with

20:48.360 --> 20:51.800
all the people that are just sickly obsessed with that game, but Resident Evil 4, I'm not

20:51.800 --> 20:55.280
going to say that I necessarily think World of Warcraft is a better game, but Resident

20:55.280 --> 20:58.280
Evil 4, I can see that. That's a pretty solid list, I'll give it to them, they've got a

20:58.280 --> 21:03.940
good list. Well, let me put it this way, it's a lot better than say, G4A. I disagree with

21:03.940 --> 21:09.640
Resident Evil 4. Really? What would you have put? I honestly would have gone with World

21:09.640 --> 21:15.500
of Warcraft or God of War. Why were you not so big on Resident Evil 4? Well, if you've

21:15.500 --> 21:21.700
followed the series, it's actually such a departure from the rest of the series, that

21:21.700 --> 21:26.380
I don't know, as a game it was great, but it wasn't Resident Evil.

21:26.380 --> 21:29.140
But if they'd called it something else, would you have been okay with it?

21:29.140 --> 21:33.940
Possibly, it would have been like, why we're pretending to be a zombie game without zombies,

21:33.940 --> 21:34.940
then yeah.

21:34.940 --> 21:35.940
All right.

21:35.940 --> 21:40.500
Well, you heard me talking earlier in the show about DDR Ultra Mix 3, which was released

21:40.500 --> 21:41.500
last week.

21:41.500 --> 21:45.300
One of the biggest gambles that Konami took was in shaking up the song list with a variety

21:45.300 --> 21:50.260
an eclectic mix of music, everything from rap, to rock, to synth, to classic Spanish

21:50.260 --> 21:51.260
music.

21:51.260 --> 21:54.300
They didn't neglect some of the things that worked for them in last year's DDR Ultra

21:54.300 --> 21:55.640
Mix 2, however.

21:55.640 --> 21:59.860
One of the songs in DDR Ultra Mix 2 that got a great reception from the fans was In My

21:59.860 --> 22:02.100
Eyes, as remixed by Midihead.

22:02.100 --> 22:07.360
Well, Midihead is back in this year's DDR Ultra Mix 3, with contributions to not one,

22:07.360 --> 22:11.260
but three songs, and we're happy to welcome Midihead to the program this week to talk

22:11.260 --> 22:15.780
about Dance Dance Revolution UltraMix III and some of his other projects. Welcome to

22:15.780 --> 22:16.780
the show, Mini-Head!

22:16.780 --> 22:24.700
I am sorry, I'm so sorry. I was downing some Pepsi one at the moment.

22:24.700 --> 22:28.380
Suddenly I thought I was reintroducing Dark Sakura, because that's usually how she introduces

22:28.380 --> 22:29.380
herself.

22:29.380 --> 22:31.380
Oh no, you mean this has already been done?

22:31.380 --> 22:34.300
Yeah, you two are going to have to have a contest someday. I don't know what's up with

22:34.300 --> 22:35.300
that.

22:35.300 --> 22:36.300
Oh geez.

22:36.300 --> 22:42.300
Well, first thing I want to know about, you know, your song in UltraMix 2 was so well received by the fans.

22:42.300 --> 22:46.300
How long did it take Konami to say, hey, we got to bring him back for UltraMix 3?

22:46.300 --> 22:50.300
It took them a couple of months to see the light, man.

22:50.300 --> 22:56.300
Just a couple of months? Do you think that's one of the reasons why you got brought back, is because the fans?

22:56.300 --> 22:59.300
Do you think they noticed that, that the fans had such a great feedback to the last time?

22:59.300 --> 23:06.300
It was all the fans. I don't think they would have called me back if the fans hadn't demanded the Mini-Head!

23:06.300 --> 23:13.300
Well awesome, well congratulations, that's great to go from one song to three songs that you contributed to, that's great.

23:13.300 --> 23:19.300
Yeah now next time, now this is a total secret of course, next time, this is for your listeners only.

23:19.300 --> 23:20.300
Alright.

23:20.300 --> 23:27.300
Next, for the next game it's going to be Mini-Heads Dance Dance Revolution Ultra Mix 4!

23:27.300 --> 23:33.300
That's it. It's going to be Dance Dance Revolution Midihead mix. That's it.

23:33.300 --> 23:39.300
I would rather dance to a mix made up completely of Midihead songs. I'll tell you what.

23:39.300 --> 23:42.300
Some of the songs they picked for this last mix because they picked some really weird stuff.

23:42.300 --> 23:45.300
Stop it. You're making me blush.

23:45.300 --> 23:51.300
All right. Well, this time one of your original songs, because most people know you for your remixes,

23:51.300 --> 23:54.300
but now one of your original tracks, Raise Your Hands, actually shows up in the game.

23:54.300 --> 23:58.720
up in the game. Did you get to suggest this, or did Konami actually listen to your album

23:58.720 --> 24:01.080
and pick something, or how did that happen?

24:01.080 --> 24:08.000
Well, actually, I just sent them a CD full of stuff after I did the In My Eyes remix.

24:08.000 --> 24:15.260
I said, you know, guys, I also have some of my own music. So they were surprised to get

24:15.260 --> 24:23.220
it and listen to it and actually hear that I have some talent in me. They decided that

24:23.220 --> 24:25.420
That was the song that was going in the next game.

24:25.420 --> 24:26.420
Well, awesome.

24:26.420 --> 24:27.580
It works really well for the game.

24:27.580 --> 24:31.060
I don't know if you've had a chance to see it in the game yet, but the cut and everything

24:31.060 --> 24:33.060
works really well, and the video's kind of cool, too.

24:33.060 --> 24:34.060
Well, it should, man.

24:34.060 --> 24:37.260
I do crunches and sit-ups to that thing.

24:37.260 --> 24:38.260
Wait, it's crunches and sit-ups.

24:38.260 --> 24:39.860
Actually, I don't think they put you in the video.

24:39.860 --> 24:42.100
I think they hired some dancers to be in it.

24:42.100 --> 24:46.020
Yeah, I'm a little too overweight for their taste.

24:46.020 --> 24:47.020
That's all right.

24:47.020 --> 24:49.560
So are most of the people playing the game.

24:49.560 --> 24:50.560
Come on.

24:50.560 --> 24:51.560
I need to get the game.

24:51.560 --> 24:52.560
You know, that's funny.

24:52.560 --> 24:58.560
This is what's funny is I've done all this work for Konami and I have yet to get the

24:58.560 --> 24:59.560
game.

24:59.560 --> 25:01.760
They haven't hooked me up with the game.

25:01.760 --> 25:03.800
They haven't sent you a copy of the game?

25:03.800 --> 25:06.620
They're going to make me go out and buy it, dammit.

25:06.620 --> 25:09.380
I know people from Konami listen to this show.

25:09.380 --> 25:10.880
Konami send him the game.

25:10.880 --> 25:11.880
He earned it.

25:11.880 --> 25:12.880
People.

25:12.880 --> 25:15.300
Of course, I need an Xbox too then at that time.

25:15.300 --> 25:17.600
They should send you all that stuff.

25:17.600 --> 25:21.800
Here's another thing I'm curious about is that your music did so well that you're in

25:21.800 --> 25:30.800
I don't even know if you know about this yet, but did you know that one of your songs is crossing over into a game that Konami is putting out in Japan?

25:30.800 --> 25:35.800
Oh my goodness! You're kidding me!

25:35.800 --> 25:36.800
No, I would hope so.

25:36.800 --> 25:37.800
I knew, I knew.

25:37.800 --> 25:38.800
I was going to say, I hope you got paid for it.

25:38.800 --> 25:40.800
You guys announced it on your website.

25:40.800 --> 25:49.800
Well, this is great. The Jelly Kiss Midi Head Smack Mix actually made its way to Beat Mania 2DX 10th style, which is coming out in Japan this month.

25:49.800 --> 25:54.280
In fact, I think it's coming out this week, so that's amazing because that doesn't happen

25:54.280 --> 25:58.700
very often where you have a song that started in the United States version of the My Series

25:58.700 --> 26:00.400
and actually goes over to Japan.

26:00.400 --> 26:03.120
I think that's only happened one other time, so you're a trendsetter.

26:03.120 --> 26:07.000
Yeah, it was with David Hasselhoff.

26:07.000 --> 26:10.120
Unless you worked under the name Big Idea, I'm not so sure about that.

26:10.120 --> 26:15.080
Oh yeah, well, I'm going to be the next David Hasselhoff of Japan.

26:15.080 --> 26:17.080
That's what's going to happen.

26:17.080 --> 26:18.640
Good luck, that would be awesome.

26:18.640 --> 26:19.640
How did that happen?

26:19.640 --> 26:22.840
did they tell you they were interested in doing this? How did that all go down?

26:22.840 --> 26:26.360
No, they don't tell me anything. Are you kidding me? They just do what they want.

26:26.360 --> 26:30.200
As long as they send you the money. They paid me. They've paid me and

26:30.200 --> 26:33.720
done away with me. They just, they just,

26:33.720 --> 26:37.040
they have full right to circulate that as they please. Well, you know,

26:37.040 --> 26:40.520
a lot of the fans were saying that you should be in Beatmania as well, and now that's

26:40.520 --> 26:44.440
happening, so you know, they're definitely listening to the fans over on some of the boards.

26:44.440 --> 26:48.520
That's one thing, that's one thing I've got to give to Konami Hawaii is

26:48.520 --> 26:56.640
the fact that they do listen to their fans. And that is to be well respected. That doesn't

26:56.640 --> 26:59.560
happen a lot in this industry.

26:59.560 --> 27:04.920
Absolutely. So kudos to Konami for actually reading and getting a pulse for what's going

27:04.920 --> 27:08.760
on on the message boards out there and giving us what we want, usually.

27:08.760 --> 27:13.780
All right. Well, we're lucky enough to actually have a copy of Jelly Kiss Midi Head Smack

27:13.780 --> 27:16.360
Mix, so we're going to go ahead and play it for you guys right now.

28:46.360 --> 29:06.240
Alright, that was Midihead's smack mix of Jelly Kiss here on Orange Lounge Radio To

29:06.240 --> 29:07.240
Go.

29:07.240 --> 29:09.120
We're joined still with the remixer himself, Midihead.

29:09.120 --> 29:13.200
A little later in the program, we'll be bringing you one of his original tunes from DDR Ultra

29:13.200 --> 29:15.360
Mix 3, Raise Your Hands.

29:15.360 --> 29:23.120
If you want to check out more information on Midihead's music, check out his website,

29:23.120 --> 29:29.960
www.midihead.com.

29:29.960 --> 29:34.120
One other thing you've actually been doing on midihead.com, for the past couple months

29:34.120 --> 29:38.840
you put out a couple podcasts of your own that were available on your website, and they

29:38.840 --> 29:43.440
were kind of teasing Dance Dance Revolution Ultramix 3 and kind of playing, hey, here's

29:43.440 --> 29:45.360
Here's some of my songs that are going to be in the game.

29:45.360 --> 29:48.800
Here's some of the other artists that are going to be in the game kind of teasing us

29:48.800 --> 29:50.340
with what was going to be in the game.

29:50.340 --> 29:52.540
Are you going to continue to do this even though the game's out?

29:52.540 --> 29:56.240
Are you thinking that podcasting is something you want to keep doing?

29:56.240 --> 29:58.400
I don't know, to be quite honest.

29:58.400 --> 30:04.760
It's a lot of time as you know to pull those things together.

30:04.760 --> 30:08.920
If I continue to get the feedback that I've been getting from all the fans, then I don't

30:08.920 --> 30:12.220
really see any reason to discontinue it.

30:12.220 --> 30:14.540
After all, we've got to give them what they want right around.

30:14.540 --> 30:17.700
We've got to make those fans happy.

30:17.700 --> 30:21.060
One thing I think they'd want is to keep knowing what's going on in the world of Konami with

30:21.060 --> 30:22.060
all their games.

30:22.060 --> 30:26.500
Do you think Konami would be good to you and let you be like their voice?

30:26.500 --> 30:38.300
Well, it's one of those concepts that certainly we're trying out right now, and I can't tell

30:38.300 --> 30:44.060
you how much dialogue I've had with Konami about it, but it's gone all the way up to

30:44.060 --> 30:55.440
corporate and we've discussed the benefits of having an artist mingle a little bit more

30:55.440 --> 31:02.580
with the fans. So in this form, it seems to be doing just fine. I just need to find the

31:02.580 --> 31:07.700
time to do more podcasts. I think if I continue doing them at the rate that I've been doing

31:07.700 --> 31:14.420
which is like every other month, and you know, it won't burn people out, and it won't burn

31:14.420 --> 31:15.420
me out.

31:15.420 --> 31:17.380
Well, we'll see what happens with that.

31:17.380 --> 31:20.460
Good luck to you in whatever you decide to do with future podcasts.

31:20.460 --> 31:25.920
Now, you know I gotta ask you this, because we're a video gaming related show, and I know

31:25.920 --> 31:30.260
you said earlier in the program you haven't gotten a chance to play DDR Ultramix 3 yet,

31:30.260 --> 31:32.620
but I'm curious, are there any other video games that you're into?

31:32.620 --> 31:34.660
What kind of video games do you like to play?

31:34.660 --> 31:41.460
Well, I gotta say, I have this really sick habit of firing up Urban Terror, and I know

31:41.460 --> 31:48.020
I've mentioned that before, it's a Quake 3 mod, and I play it a little more than I really

31:48.020 --> 31:49.020
should.

31:49.020 --> 31:52.440
Are you looking forward to Quake 4?

31:52.440 --> 31:53.440
Quake 4?

31:53.440 --> 31:54.440
Yeah.

31:54.440 --> 32:00.920
You know, Rob, I have to say that although I used to play a lot more video games in my

32:00.920 --> 32:08.260
time, I don't find a lot of time to dive into as much first-person shooterism as I'd like

32:08.260 --> 32:09.260
to.

32:09.260 --> 32:13.020
It's good, though, to remind our listeners that there is a real world out there, outside

32:13.020 --> 32:17.140
of video games, that sometimes involves work, working two or three jobs, family, and family.

32:17.140 --> 32:21.620
Yeah, work and kids and life and house and payments, and I think I've pretty much summed

32:21.620 --> 32:22.620
it up.

32:22.620 --> 32:23.620
Exactly.

32:23.620 --> 32:24.620
Enjoy youth while it lasts, kiddies.

32:24.620 --> 32:25.620
Right.

32:25.620 --> 32:26.620
You bet.

32:26.620 --> 32:27.620
You better enjoy youth while it lasts.

32:27.620 --> 32:31.180
Even though you don't get a whole lot of time to play the games, you're still working with

32:31.180 --> 32:34.620
a lot of games, and one thing that was kind of new that we found out about a couple weeks

32:34.620 --> 32:38.620
ago is this new game, Dance Tracks, which I guess is a new dancing game.

32:38.620 --> 32:41.820
And in the preliminary song list that they've released, we noticed a couple of your songs

32:41.820 --> 32:43.240
were in the song list.

32:43.240 --> 32:45.780
How did you get involved with the Dance Tracks project?

32:45.780 --> 32:54.340
Well, that one spawned off of the remix of In My Eyes, spawned off a phone call, and

32:54.340 --> 32:56.860
there I am.

32:56.860 --> 33:14.980
Should I just tell him this exciting story about how I was laying dying in my hospital

33:14.980 --> 33:19.700
bed after knee surgery and they cut a main artery and I was bleeding to death and overcame

33:19.700 --> 33:22.100
was it D.M. Ashira?

33:22.100 --> 33:23.100
Yeah.

33:23.100 --> 33:24.100
Yeah.

33:24.100 --> 33:30.620
So, he's the one that actually contacted you behind this game.

33:30.620 --> 33:33.780
We don't know much about the game, so we're trying to figure out little bits and pieces

33:33.780 --> 33:40.980
wherever we can, and if hospital bed, leg amputee be it, then that's all we know so

33:40.980 --> 33:41.980
far.

33:41.980 --> 33:42.980
Alright.

33:42.980 --> 33:46.340
The show's getting out of control now.

33:46.340 --> 33:54.380
Alright, well, back to a more serious story, I bet probably a year and a half ago you probably

33:54.380 --> 33:58.340
didn't think that you would be so involved with video games as you are now.

33:58.340 --> 33:59.340
I don't know.

33:59.340 --> 34:00.340
Is that true?

34:00.340 --> 34:03.340
Of course I knew I was going to be involved in video games.

34:03.340 --> 34:04.340
Are you kidding me?

34:04.340 --> 34:12.780
I paint my entire destiny for them.

34:12.780 --> 34:17.120
Video games was something that I had planned on doing eventually, I just didnít know when

34:17.120 --> 34:18.120
it was going to happen.

34:18.120 --> 34:24.600
So everything I do in my musical avenues, I always try to leave as many doors open when

34:24.600 --> 34:28.280
Iím doing stuff, and here I am.

34:28.280 --> 34:32.180
So do you have future plans to continue working with video games?

34:32.180 --> 34:36.480
If the moneyís there, yeah, are you kidding me?

34:36.480 --> 34:40.520
That sums it up everybody, weíll go where the moneyís at, wonít we?

34:40.520 --> 34:43.960
I gotta pay for my house, man. I live in Southern California.

34:43.960 --> 34:49.760
Oh, ouch. Alright, well, Midiehead, that's about all the time we have, but thanks so much for being on the show today.

34:49.760 --> 34:56.240
We appreciate it. Once again, guys, check it out, www.midiehead.com if you're interested in Midiehead.

34:56.240 --> 35:01.160
And he's got his own music there that you can download, and the forums, and his podcast.

35:01.160 --> 35:06.200
It's just an action-packed site, so check it out, everybody. Thanks so much, Midiehead, for being on the show.

35:06.200 --> 35:08.240
Yeah, you're welcome, dude.

35:08.240 --> 35:12.200
Alright! Yay Midihead! Let's move on to another story.

35:12.200 --> 35:16.160
We're going to talk about this. This is a rumor that's out right now is that a

35:16.160 --> 35:18.720
Zelda movie is on the way out.

35:18.720 --> 35:23.720
I don't know about this but this came out of Club Nintendo which is a Mexican

35:23.720 --> 35:26.340
publication is very similar to Nintendo Power.

35:26.340 --> 35:30.280
It was Reggie Phil's aim

35:30.280 --> 35:34.000
was the guy at Nintendo that actually talked to this magazine about it

35:34.000 --> 35:38.880
saying that they want to do Metroid and then Zelda would be next in line

35:38.880 --> 35:42.620
but the weird thing about this is that I thought that John Woo

35:42.620 --> 35:45.600
got the rights to Metroid but this is indicating that

35:45.600 --> 35:49.240
Nintendo actually somehow bought this back and I didn't know that that had

35:49.240 --> 35:49.840
happened

35:49.840 --> 35:54.980
so I don't know yeah this article apparently indicates that Nintendo bought

35:54.980 --> 35:58.400
back the rights from John Woo so that's kinda interesting if that happened and

35:58.400 --> 35:59.600
kinda was under the radar

35:59.600 --> 36:03.120
so I I don't know if Zelda should trust it unless it's an

36:03.120 --> 36:07.000
official Nintendo yeah I'm a little question mark on this I'm not gonna

36:07.000 --> 36:10.600
believe it just yet I mean it is kind of neat to think about a Zelda movie but at

36:10.600 --> 36:15.680
the same time do we really need a Zelda movie I don't know because the games are

36:15.680 --> 36:20.560
so freaking phenomenal of course Metroid or Metroid is great too but I don't know

36:20.560 --> 36:23.360
Zelda seems like one of those things where it's already a movie we don't need

36:23.360 --> 36:27.800
another movie if they did they would have to do it right well I would hope

36:27.800 --> 36:33.160
they would all right Jamie you had another story for us about one of the

36:33.160 --> 36:37.680
Xbox 360 launch games might be kind of buggy what's going on with this well

36:37.680 --> 36:45.320
rare has stated that they took a very big risk with perfect dark zero so that

36:45.320 --> 36:48.920
it would be released on launch day they said typically it goes to a

36:48.920 --> 36:53.040
certification process to finish it up and then it's released to be

36:53.040 --> 36:57.520
manufactured but they've gone ahead and released to manufacturing without it

36:57.520 --> 36:59.680
going through their certification process.

36:59.680 --> 37:02.560
They actually said they gave the go-ahead five days

37:02.560 --> 37:04.860
before the game certification.

37:04.860 --> 37:05.360
Wow.

37:05.360 --> 37:07.360
And then if their certification doesn't pass,

37:07.360 --> 37:10.460
they essentially quoted here that they

37:10.460 --> 37:14.560
would have hundreds of thousands of disks on their hands.

37:14.560 --> 37:17.760
That is a huge risk, because that's a big penalty.

37:17.760 --> 37:19.760
I know Microsoft is huge.

37:19.760 --> 37:22.240
All the game companies really are is huge on those.

37:22.240 --> 37:24.000
Everything's got to be right and certified.

37:24.000 --> 37:26.840
That is a huge risk you're taking there.

37:26.840 --> 37:31.260
I guess Rare kind of working directly with Microsoft can get away with it a little more

37:31.260 --> 37:34.100
but that's crazy.

37:34.100 --> 37:36.780
I hope the game makes it or we're all in trouble.

37:36.780 --> 37:42.140
Well it's also stated on there though that Rare puts a lot of work into polishing the

37:42.140 --> 37:48.260
game so they're sure that it's going to be okay but they've produced 700,000 copies for

37:48.260 --> 37:49.260
the US.

37:49.260 --> 37:50.260
Wow.

37:50.260 --> 37:55.060
So that every person who has an Xbox 360 will also have that title.

37:55.060 --> 37:57.060
Now we know how many are coming out.

37:57.060 --> 38:02.060
Well that's their estimate, that's the estimate.

38:02.060 --> 38:04.060
Well I would think that they would know what they're talking about

38:04.060 --> 38:06.060
seeing as they have to communicate directly with Microsoft.

38:06.060 --> 38:08.060
Hey wait, Microsoft you said that we're only getting...

38:08.060 --> 38:11.060
But that doesn't mean we're getting 700,000 of them on Tuesday.

38:11.060 --> 38:14.060
That just means they're making 700,000 of them for the first run.

38:14.060 --> 38:16.060
First run, first launch.

38:16.060 --> 38:21.060
That also though explains why the game hasn't been available for review by some places.

38:21.060 --> 38:25.860
Speaking of which, by the way, not only that, we've got more problems with Perfect Dark

38:25.860 --> 38:26.860
Zero.

38:26.860 --> 38:31.260
It was supposed to be out on Friday, but apparently they're having trouble getting into the United

38:31.260 --> 38:33.300
States because it has to ship from China now.

38:33.300 --> 38:34.300
They're running way behind.

38:34.300 --> 38:39.440
It's got to delay it to launch day instead of before launch day, which was interesting.

38:39.440 --> 38:42.940
And we're not even sure if it's going to be there on launch day either.

38:42.940 --> 38:45.460
So that's probably why you can't find it in stores right now either.

38:45.460 --> 38:46.460
Interesting.

38:46.460 --> 38:57.460
Well if anything, are they having to ship it directly from China to the States? Or did they have it shipped specifically?

38:57.460 --> 39:07.460
They said basically what happens is they ship it from China and it ends up in one of two places. Either Toledo, Ohio, or I can't remember the other location.

39:07.460 --> 39:11.460
Then those get sent to Central Hub and then shipped out to stores from there.

39:11.460 --> 39:16.980
And one of the other things that they mentioned which was very interesting here, Joanna Dark

39:16.980 --> 39:19.400
does not feature jumping.

39:19.400 --> 39:20.400
She cannot jump.

39:20.400 --> 39:22.900
What good is she then?

39:22.900 --> 39:25.420
Hey, as long as she's got boobs.

39:25.420 --> 39:26.420
Hey!

39:26.420 --> 39:27.420
Just kidding.

39:27.420 --> 39:32.740
Alright, speaking of the Xbox 360, now the other week we were talking about the backwards

39:32.740 --> 39:36.460
compatibility and how there's like 200 games that are going to be backwards compatible

39:36.460 --> 39:39.420
here in the US and people are saying that's not enough, that's not enough.

39:39.420 --> 39:43.080
guess what kids be thankful you don't live in Japan because guess how many

39:43.080 --> 39:48.320
games are going to be backwards compatible at launch in Japan 12 that's

39:48.320 --> 39:53.160
it 12 now they promise they'll be adding more and more but all you're getting at

39:53.160 --> 39:57.480
the first run through is 12 now granted these are probably some of the biggest

39:57.480 --> 40:05.080
games Halo Halo 2 Ninja Gaiden Rainbow Six Crimson Skies Fable and then of

40:05.080 --> 40:09.440
course Simpsons hit-and-run is just randomly in there too but kind of

40:09.440 --> 40:13.120
interesting that they're not getting quite as many but of course not as many

40:13.120 --> 40:16.080
people bought Xboxes in Japan so maybe they're not as worried I don't know

40:16.080 --> 40:19.560
ironically enough those 12 games also happen to be the same number of people

40:19.560 --> 40:24.560
that purchase an Xbox in Japan oh ho zing all right low-key what else you got

40:24.560 --> 40:28.400
for us well more on the Xbox stuff one of the things I thought was pretty cool

40:28.400 --> 40:32.840
about the whole 360 launch in the first place is the Xbox Live arcade and they

40:32.840 --> 40:38.160
have a ton of stuff out there going to be available for you to download, but they've

40:38.160 --> 40:43.400
actually kind of released what they're going to be releasing initially.

40:43.400 --> 40:51.100
For old retro games, they've got Gauntlet, Robotron, as well as Joust, which will be

40:51.100 --> 40:58.300
really cool, Smash TV, which I thought was really neat, then of course my favorite, which

40:58.300 --> 41:04.460
is going to be, well actually they have a few other ones here, Hectics, which is that

41:04.460 --> 41:10.940
one that was put out by the guy that did Tetris, another game. Bejeweled 2, for all those Bejeweled

41:10.940 --> 41:16.140
fans out there. And I can play that online for free. I know, I know, I know. And then,

41:16.140 --> 41:21.260
of course my favorite, Geometry Wars Retro Evolved, which seems to be everybody's favorite

41:21.260 --> 41:24.140
out there. Those are going to be available, most of the games are actually going to be

41:24.140 --> 41:27.480
available for either five to ten dollars geometry wars and some of the better

41:27.480 --> 41:31.580
ones are actually gonna be five bucks a few of them are gonna be ten and one

41:31.580 --> 41:39.900
some billiards game is $15 for download oh it's top shell smash TV do I think

41:39.900 --> 41:45.540
that was one of the ones that's five which is cool I would hope so but but

41:45.540 --> 41:50.620
considering you can buy it as part of a $20 pack with 20 games it's really only

41:50.620 --> 41:57.240
worth a dollar okay all right all right but here's the cool thing though least

41:57.240 --> 42:01.160
they do have free demos you can try out so you can try these games before you

42:01.160 --> 42:05.680
buy them that's nice other than they're gonna have free demos for other games

42:05.680 --> 42:08.880
like me for speed most one are gonna be on there as well as some of the other

42:08.880 --> 42:13.200
EA games and stuff that that's kind of cool and of course more gamer tags you

42:13.200 --> 42:17.360
can purchase and all that stuff a lot of ways to waste your money so all right

42:17.360 --> 42:23.360
well you don't want to waste all your money on video games though because you

42:23.360 --> 42:27.520
know if you spent all your days playing video games you'd have no time to go out

42:27.520 --> 42:30.560
and spend your money on strippers like looky did this past week right looky

42:30.560 --> 42:35.340
that was yesterday yeah anyway uh so here to always remind us that there is a

42:35.340 --> 42:39.200
real life outside of gaming is the one and only dark Sakura and it's been a

42:39.200 --> 42:42.400
couple weeks so she's been able to give you a piece of her advice so here it is

42:42.400 --> 42:48.240
Dark Sakura's advice column and Dark Sakura, what are you going to be talking to us about tonight?

42:49.040 --> 42:52.800
Today's bit of advice is how to leap from a motorcycle to a car.

42:54.320 --> 42:58.960
Number one, make sure the vehicles are moving at the same speed. That's very important.

42:59.920 --> 43:04.240
Two, wait for a long straight section of road before positioning the vehicles as

43:04.240 --> 43:09.200
close as possible to each other. You will be on the passenger side of the car so you

43:09.200 --> 43:14.640
will be very close to the edge of the roadway. 3. Crouch with both of your feet on the running

43:14.640 --> 43:19.680
board or the seat and hold the throttle until the last instant. Remember, as soon as you release

43:19.680 --> 43:26.560
the throttle, the bike speed will decrease. 4. If the car has an inside handle above the door,

43:26.560 --> 43:31.840
grab it. If not, simply time the leap so your torso lands in the car. If you miss the window,

43:31.840 --> 43:37.120
tuck and roll away from the vehicles. 5. Have the driver swerve away from the bike as soon

43:37.120 --> 43:41.280
as you're inside the bike may slip under the rear passenger side wheel of the car

43:41.280 --> 43:48.960
but my final piece of advice yes just freaking don't try jumping into a car

43:48.960 --> 43:55.720
while it's moving that's stupid or at least tell the guy to stop just shoot

43:55.720 --> 44:01.040
him first I don't know all right that's why you put that's why you shoot the

44:01.040 --> 44:08.280
tires and then throw the guy out of the car and then drive off somewhere we can

44:08.280 --> 44:14.600
change the tire all right that's much easier for the love of God don't tell

44:14.600 --> 44:19.720
them you saw it in a video game yeah don't tell no no no tell them that you

44:19.720 --> 44:26.200
saw it on the edited GTA 3 speaking of which pursuit force is available for

44:26.200 --> 44:30.480
purchase for the PSP coming this spring.

44:30.480 --> 44:33.880
I didn't want to say the words Jack Thompson, but what you said kind of made me think of

44:33.880 --> 44:34.880
that.

44:34.880 --> 44:37.880
I heard he got booted off that case in Alabama or something and the judge yelled at him or

44:37.880 --> 44:38.880
something.

44:38.880 --> 44:39.880
I might be kind of...

44:39.880 --> 44:40.880
He didn't get booted.

44:40.880 --> 44:41.880
He quit.

44:41.880 --> 44:42.880
I didn't.

44:42.880 --> 44:43.880
That's not what I read.

44:43.880 --> 44:44.880
He's a big loser.

44:44.880 --> 44:45.880
Oh well.

44:45.880 --> 44:47.440
No, I'm just amused by his Amazon rating.

44:47.440 --> 44:48.440
What is it?

44:48.440 --> 44:51.760
37,000 on Amazon's list?

44:51.760 --> 44:52.920
Don't give him a free plug.

44:52.920 --> 44:57.320
Hey, speaking of which, people that like the Jack Thompson book also recommend gay porno

44:57.320 --> 44:58.320
books as well.

44:58.320 --> 44:59.320
Really?

44:59.320 --> 45:00.320
Really.

45:00.320 --> 45:01.320
That's an insult.

45:01.320 --> 45:06.120
I'm just making fun of him because he's a loser.

45:06.120 --> 45:07.120
All right.

45:07.120 --> 45:12.220
He does nothing but embarrass himself, so I think he's a good point of humor.

45:12.220 --> 45:15.920
Gay pornography can at least be artistic sometimes.

45:15.920 --> 45:17.600
Jack Thompson's work, never artistic.

45:17.600 --> 45:18.600
All right.

45:18.600 --> 45:19.600
No.

45:19.600 --> 45:21.080
Let's talk about The Matrix online.

45:21.080 --> 45:25.240
Loki this is a game you played for about what three days three minutes yeah well

45:25.240 --> 45:29.280
I actually people are still playing it apparently this game was shut down no

45:29.280 --> 45:32.440
it's saying that the matrix online so good they did some of that they did a

45:32.440 --> 45:37.400
server consolidation I think they didn't shut it down anyway they are doing

45:37.400 --> 45:41.840
another update it's update number 38 and they're gonna be doing in-game

45:41.840 --> 45:48.180
advertising courtesy of massive we'll be doing the in-game advertising using the

45:48.180 --> 45:54.600
billboards they kind of already do some real-world product advertising but now

45:54.600 --> 45:58.860
they're gonna do stuff you know that's bought advertising because the

45:58.860 --> 46:02.340
advertising they had before was for like let's say the clothing was used in the

46:02.340 --> 46:05.760
game they'd give that clothing company free advertising so now they're gonna do

46:05.760 --> 46:11.160
I guess selling for the advertising whatever and that those ads will be

46:11.160 --> 46:15.400
refreshing and updating with pretty good frequency in the game there so very

46:15.400 --> 46:20.440
interesting I I'm just kind of surprised that the game is still has such a large

46:20.440 --> 46:24.040
following I see as they don't off all the characters yeah I don't want to I

46:24.040 --> 46:27.000
don't want to bash on you know matrix online because it seemed alright and I

46:27.000 --> 46:30.160
can see where people get into it because it does continue the matrix story but I

46:30.160 --> 46:34.380
don't know I just it doesn't have that same play me play me over and over again

46:34.380 --> 46:38.580
like some of the other MMOs do I don't know I enjoy the matrix games that

46:38.580 --> 46:44.560
online not just Ragnarok but Final Fantasy Warcraft tell anything anyway

46:44.560 --> 46:51.020
for all those people who are willing to play the sort of mindless rounds of PSO

46:51.020 --> 46:57.180
and yes I was one of them you know it has its addictions all right

46:57.180 --> 47:04.660
Dark Sakura what do you have considering release dates in the UK I have quite a

47:04.660 --> 47:11.860

48:07.500 --> 48:10.180
sometime this month, we just don't have a date on it.

48:10.180 --> 48:11.180
Awesome.

48:11.180 --> 48:14.580
Alright, that for our friends over in the UK, and here in the US, I don't have a calendar

48:14.580 --> 48:19.140
in front of me for the US, but everything's all about the 360 this next week, and that's

48:19.140 --> 48:22.020
what a lot of people have been talking about, but there's been a lot of great games released

48:22.020 --> 48:25.940
for other systems here this past week too, I mean we had Mario Kart DS, we had the Ultra

48:25.940 --> 48:31.820
Mix, we had Call of Duty on other systems as well, Call of Duty Big Red One, yeah, just

48:31.820 --> 48:33.580
lots of games coming out this week.

48:33.580 --> 48:38.540
This week was, or last week I should say, was one of the biggest launch weeks of the

48:38.540 --> 48:39.540
year.

48:39.540 --> 48:40.540
Oh yeah, it always is.

48:40.540 --> 48:41.540
Yeah, it always is.

48:41.540 --> 48:43.540
Wait, wait, wait, this is the Big Red One?

48:43.540 --> 48:50.500
I need somebody who was in that, that's kind of cool.

48:50.500 --> 48:53.460
Moving on, let's go to Loki, do you have any more stories?

48:53.460 --> 48:56.620
Yeah, I got some stuff on the PSP actually, it's pretty cool.

48:56.620 --> 49:01.780
The first one being this program called PSP Advanced, and what it was is actually some

49:01.780 --> 49:07.220
software that kind of acts like iTunes, but for the PSP, so it allows you to put on video

49:07.220 --> 49:13.940
and MP3s and stuff, very simple-like, and you can also play a lot of different formats

49:13.940 --> 49:18.940
that you couldn't play before, like divx files and whatnot, and basically this program

49:18.940 --> 49:24.580
goes on your PSP runs on homebrew so it's you know made by an actual you

49:24.580 --> 49:27.940
know commercial company that's you know doing this and what's really cool they

49:27.940 --> 49:31.140
were talking about selling it at first but they've decided to go ahead and

49:31.140 --> 49:36.740
release the full version for free so you can actually go to pspadvance.com and

49:36.740 --> 49:44.260
download the full version of it it works on I believe firmware 1.5 and 2.0 and you

49:44.260 --> 49:48.700
can basically act it has a PC program goes with it and you can stream your

49:48.700 --> 49:53.620
media files to your PSP and it's pretty awesome.

49:53.620 --> 49:54.620
Sounds cool.

49:54.620 --> 49:55.900
So, you know, that's really neat.

49:55.900 --> 49:59.900
The other thing which, of course, I'm excited about because Orange Laundry is all about

49:59.900 --> 50:05.780
the Bomani games is PSP Revolution 0.1 was just released.

50:05.780 --> 50:10.340
It's basically Step Mania, kind of a Dance Dance Revolution sim for the PSP.

50:10.340 --> 50:16.320
Works really good, actually plays all the Step Mania and DWI files and you can go find

50:16.320 --> 50:17.760
those on like wonderful websites like

50:17.760 --> 50:19.240
Fomani style and stuff and they have a

50:19.240 --> 50:21.640
whole listing of them and just really

50:21.640 --> 50:23.400
cool that they have that to go now so

50:23.400 --> 50:25.920
I'm sure a lot more stuff will be added

50:25.920 --> 50:27.000
to that as well.

50:27.000 --> 50:29.320
Alright, alright we're going to go over

50:29.320 --> 50:31.480
to our mailbag because it's been a

50:31.480 --> 50:33.200
little while since, well actually I

50:33.200 --> 50:34.880
snuck into the mailbag when you weren't

50:34.880 --> 50:36.240
here last week Dark Soccer I hope you

50:36.240 --> 50:38.240
don't mind I snuck in there and stole

50:38.240 --> 50:41.000
some letters. You're allowed.

50:41.000 --> 50:43.080
Alright but Dark Soccer is going to read

50:43.080 --> 50:45.320
us some letters that are in our mailbox

50:45.320 --> 50:51.140
box and if you want to send us an email it's togo togo at orange lounge radio

50:51.140 --> 51:03.200
comms places in your letters dark soccer what do we have this week yes I couldn't

51:03.200 --> 51:06.620
get the article to pull up because you have to be a member of that site and I

51:06.620 --> 51:11.720
was like man but I'll go ahead and read the email said hey alright just

51:11.720 --> 51:15.680
So we encountered an article talking about current developments on educational video

51:15.680 --> 51:16.680
games.

51:16.680 --> 51:21.200
Now professors are continuing to take them seriously as fundamental learning tools.

51:21.200 --> 51:22.200
What do you guys think?

51:22.200 --> 51:27.200
Will we see real great educational and fun video games popping up in schools in several

51:27.200 --> 51:28.200
years?

51:28.200 --> 51:33.040
Not just like the classics in elementary school like Word Manager, but like some similar ones

51:33.040 --> 51:36.720
to the ones stated in the article.

51:36.720 --> 51:43.200
Maybe games that teach English to non-native speakers or foreign languages, Japanese, French,

51:43.200 --> 51:45.720
Spanish, Chinese to name a few.

51:45.720 --> 51:49.280
As for real life scenario games involving ethics in real life situations like firing

51:49.280 --> 51:54.520
someone in tough decisions, I'm slightly skeptical but I could see them put into intriguing action

51:54.520 --> 51:56.160
adventure games.

51:56.160 --> 51:58.200
Sex Education the Video Game.

51:58.200 --> 52:01.200
Anyway just asking what you guys think.

52:01.200 --> 52:05.080
I'm kinda surprised that this is news. I mean, I

52:05.080 --> 52:08.900
kinda thought we were using computers and games for education type scenarios

52:08.900 --> 52:09.560
for a long time.

52:09.560 --> 52:13.240
In my profession actually, I'm not sure, you know, my day job, what I do is I

52:13.240 --> 52:15.160
actually teach people. I'm a corporate trainer

52:15.160 --> 52:19.160
and I like to use computer-based things all the time and sometimes that might be a

52:19.160 --> 52:22.680
scenario where, you know, they actually choose like multiple choice

52:22.680 --> 52:23.520
questions that

52:23.520 --> 52:28.000
will alter the scenario of events. I don't want to give away too much of what it is I

52:28.000 --> 52:28.600
do, but

52:28.600 --> 52:31.840
there might be like a multiple-choice thing and it changes the events and they

52:31.840 --> 52:33.520
watch what happens to their character

52:33.520 --> 52:37.520
in some aspects and of course you know naming back to the classics there

52:37.520 --> 52:41.720
we've already been using that game element in teaching for a long time like

52:41.720 --> 52:46.080
Jeopardy! that's an old classic I use that for review all the time in my class so

52:46.080 --> 52:51.120
I don't know I maybe it would help me to know like I'm assuming the article is

52:51.120 --> 52:54.040
talking a little more about console games and what the rest of us kinda

52:54.040 --> 52:55.720
think of as games games

52:55.720 --> 52:59.320
and I don't think I see that connection too much maybe but

52:59.320 --> 53:02.740
we need to return to where in the world is Carmen Sandiego

53:02.740 --> 53:09.300
yes in the classics Oregon Trail and all that stuff I'm sure that stuff is still being used today

53:09.300 --> 53:14.120
but I think that you do have

53:14.120 --> 53:20.480
potential though to expand it beyond what we having now to go into

53:20.480 --> 53:25.000
like you know a lot of times the games are easy to use for younger

53:25.000 --> 53:28.320
for the younger ages, but I think that

53:28.320 --> 53:32.080
they don't always utilize that properly for

53:32.080 --> 53:35.360
older teens and up. And I think that

53:35.360 --> 53:39.800
that would be actually a good market to get into is to have the whole

53:39.800 --> 53:42.960
lessons, whole courses done, you know,

53:42.960 --> 53:46.800
as an educational game. I think it could work.

53:46.800 --> 53:50.480
It would depend on the game, of course, because remember,

53:50.480 --> 53:53.760
a class is only as good as the games that are

53:53.760 --> 53:59.000
Todd in it. No, forget it. Alright. You got one more quick email for us?

53:59.000 --> 54:02.120
One more from Rini.

54:02.120 --> 54:06.120
Just to sort of paraphrase a bit,

54:06.120 --> 54:09.240
basically stating that

54:09.240 --> 54:14.320
one particular reason not everyone should run out to buy a 360 or PS3

54:14.320 --> 54:18.320
or whatever on its launch date is possible problems with faults in the console.

54:18.320 --> 54:23.240
Just stating again, I am reminded of the PS2 launch

54:23.240 --> 54:26.060
when the thing erased memory cards and something else.

54:26.060 --> 54:27.700
Of course, we did not encounter this,

54:27.700 --> 54:29.580
but then you'd have to go out to your nurse retailer

54:29.580 --> 54:33.940
and get an append disk or mentioning of an upgrade station.

54:33.940 --> 54:37.820
Another reason is, you know,

54:37.820 --> 54:41.520
dealing with, I guess, the quality of the systems,

54:41.520 --> 54:42.500
holding off for something

54:42.500 --> 54:44.700
that might be better down the line,

54:44.700 --> 54:47.440
and also wanting to know where the ferrets are.

54:47.440 --> 54:51.220
The ferrets were around here somewhere.

54:51.220 --> 54:52.760
They might've died from starvation

54:52.760 --> 54:57.960
because you haven't been here actually I'm not sure what's going on wait hold

54:57.960 --> 55:11.600
on they're still here all right all right to send us an email send us email

55:11.600 --> 55:17.480
to go to go at orange lounge radio.com very good point there by the last email

55:17.480 --> 55:23.520
there um a lot of times those consoles have problems with the first releases so

55:23.520 --> 55:30.800
maybe a reason to hold off I don't know but I have a first release Japanese ps2

55:30.800 --> 55:36.760
that still works to this day well yeah but it depends on how much you use them

55:36.760 --> 55:40.960
to because you don't game all day long nor do I also don't use it as a DVD

55:40.960 --> 55:44.800
player either that's true and we hear that the they were not good for DVD

55:44.800 --> 55:51.000
players the first few I'll have you know especially with the ps2 the more you use

55:51.000 --> 55:57.080
it as a dedicated DVD player the more chance you have of ruining the system

55:57.080 --> 56:03.280
itself by that motor drive I have my actually my first my ps2 got it at

56:03.280 --> 56:08.320
launch date and playing music as my dedicated DVD player perfectly fine

56:08.320 --> 56:11.600
because you have a satanic curse in your house that keeps that thing running is

56:11.600 --> 56:12.600
what it is.

56:12.600 --> 56:13.600
Alright.

56:13.600 --> 56:20.080
I've actually known plenty of people who've had, who use this as their primary, as their

56:20.080 --> 56:23.160
primary DVD player and have had nothing but problems.

56:23.160 --> 56:27.040
I use my Xbox as my primary DVD player but I just, I don't play games on it.

56:27.040 --> 56:28.760
The Xbox was made quite a bit better.

56:28.760 --> 56:32.280
Yeah, the Xbox was made quite a bit better and since I paid extra for that DVD kit you

56:32.280 --> 56:33.840
better believe it's going to work.

56:33.840 --> 56:36.320
Anyway, Loki, we're running out of time.

56:36.320 --> 56:38.160
Loki, you got another story for us?

56:38.160 --> 56:39.160
Yeah, real quick.

56:39.160 --> 56:44.500
Of course, we gotta still talk about the 360 launch being that it is on Tuesday.

56:44.500 --> 56:49.700
They had some craziness on Friday when Circuit City started taking pre-orders for what 360s

56:49.700 --> 56:50.700
they were gonna have.

56:50.700 --> 56:53.340
Oh, I remember what we mentioned last week, oh, they're gonna sell them in the stores

56:53.340 --> 56:56.660
on Friday, and sure enough, like the day after our podcast rolled out, oh no, that was all

56:56.660 --> 56:57.660
a big lie.

56:57.660 --> 56:58.660
Yeah.

56:58.660 --> 56:59.660
So Circuit City's, I don't know who knows what's going on there.

56:59.660 --> 57:00.660
So they were being sold on their website.

57:00.660 --> 57:04.160
They actually did have the units out of the bundles, so that was kind of interesting.

57:04.160 --> 57:08.700
Or you could pre-order the bundle and delete the additional stuff on there, which is also

57:08.700 --> 57:11.700
Well that was if you're lucky enough to be able to actually get through.

57:11.700 --> 57:17.700
The site was hammered so much it went down as well as their entire technical support line was just jammed up.

57:17.700 --> 57:19.700
So that was interesting.

57:19.700 --> 57:23.700
There's actually people now camping for their 360 right now.

57:23.700 --> 57:28.700
But you can always assure that celebrities are going to have one.

57:28.700 --> 57:33.700
They had an LA launch party for the 360 and Paris Hilton has a bag with a 360.

57:33.700 --> 57:36.700
That is so fucked up. What do you think Paris Hilton is going to play on her 360?

57:36.700 --> 57:40.360
360. She doesn't know what a 360 is, okay? That's basically that.

57:40.360 --> 57:43.460
And then finally my favorite store in the world.

57:43.460 --> 57:46.700
That makes me mad that you won't get a 360 but Paris Hilton will.

57:46.700 --> 57:50.640
Come on! You know she's a big gamer.

57:50.640 --> 57:54.580
Anyways. Well, not video games. My personal favorite

57:54.580 --> 57:57.820
is the ad for Best Buy

57:57.820 --> 58:03.520
showing the 360 and stating that's the absolute latest in gaming that burns

58:03.520 --> 58:05.140
CDs and DVDs too.

58:05.140 --> 58:08.900
thank you Best Buy for lying and not even knowing what the hell you're talking about

58:08.900 --> 58:13.180
I will not be going to Best Buy to buy anything for my 360 thank you very much

58:13.180 --> 58:16.540
it's just one mistake it's a pretty mistake don't blame the whole

58:16.540 --> 58:17.380
well that's not why I'm...

58:17.380 --> 58:19.980
they're actually false advertising and they can be held accountable for it

58:19.980 --> 58:24.300
oh my you guys are you guys are vicious we sue you

58:24.300 --> 58:28.420
gotta be vicious to keep up oh man I hate to be in line with you people

58:28.420 --> 58:31.860
on Tuesday hurry up buddy guess who's not gonna be in line

58:31.860 --> 58:36.860
Look, don't rub it in. Stop rubbing it in. We'll come to your house and take it.

58:36.860 --> 58:49.860
Real quick mentions, if you pre-order Dirge of Service right now, you can actually get the tech demo for Final Fantasy VII, the video plus, which is ahead of the trailers coming out for that.

58:49.860 --> 58:55.860
Also, with Metal Gear Acid 2, 3D version of the Metal Gear Solid 4 trailer.

58:55.860 --> 58:56.860
Not bad.

58:56.860 --> 58:57.860
Yeah, very cool.

58:57.860 --> 58:59.860
That's US pre-orders, right?

58:59.860 --> 59:00.860
Yes.

59:00.860 --> 59:06.580
Okay, Dark Sakura has our last story tonight regarding gaming in another country

59:08.940 --> 59:14.340
We've got one actually published by Eurogamer a group of German politicians

59:14.820 --> 59:18.720
Proposed to ban on all video games that show lethal violence

59:20.860 --> 59:23.260
That that's pretty that's pretty much simply it

59:24.820 --> 59:26.820
They're actually

59:26.820 --> 59:33.540
it's a it's basically already looking at and I'm trying to find the group that

59:33.540 --> 59:39.300
was calling for this the Christian Social Union saying that killing games

59:39.300 --> 59:45.220
have no place in Germany's bedrooms there already though are having some

59:45.220 --> 59:49.700
folks against that if only you people knew what went on in my bedroom the

59:49.700 --> 59:55.540
gaming happens in the living room I shouldn't have said that on the radio

59:55.540 --> 01:00:03.100
The head of Germany's Interactive Software Association, Olaf Wolters, basically was quoted

01:00:03.100 --> 01:00:07.420
in Der Spiegel saying, ìAs far as weíre concerned, there are no such things as killer

01:00:07.420 --> 01:00:12.060
games but adult games, and theyíre willing to work with the governments to resolve the

01:00:12.060 --> 01:00:17.500
issue.î Itís stated also that Germany has some of the strictest censorship laws in the

01:00:17.500 --> 01:00:23.980
world, but they needed revision, especially after in 2002 a 19-year-old shot and killed

01:00:23.980 --> 01:00:30.980
16 people in Erfurt before turning the gun on himself, as he was also an avid player

01:00:30.980 --> 01:00:31.980
of Counter-Strike.

01:00:31.980 --> 01:00:39.660
It's saying the new legislation, if approved, will go into effect March 2008.

01:00:39.660 --> 01:00:44.260
Just a bunch of crazy people trying to ban things because they can't watch their kids.

01:00:44.260 --> 01:00:45.260
It's just stupid.

01:00:45.260 --> 01:00:46.260
I know.

01:00:46.260 --> 01:00:47.260
It won't happen.

01:00:47.260 --> 01:00:48.860
You know what's going to happen though?

01:00:48.860 --> 01:00:53.220
The only way we're going to be able to solve violent games in Germany is to make more David

01:00:53.220 --> 01:00:56.900
Hasselhoff game I knew you were gonna make it David has off I was trying to

01:00:56.900 --> 01:01:00.740
think of a good Shiza porn joke but I just now I want to keep this a family

01:01:00.740 --> 01:01:10.300
show tonight uh Jamie your thoughts I don't know you know it's really hard

01:01:10.300 --> 01:01:13.940
because you know how I feel about this parents should be doing their jobs right

01:01:13.940 --> 01:01:18.500
mm-hmm the manufacturers should also be taking responsibility to label their

01:01:18.500 --> 01:01:24.180
games correctly yes mm-hmm but I don't think that the government has any

01:01:24.180 --> 01:01:28.700
business poking their nose into it it should be left up to the consumer and up

01:01:28.700 --> 01:01:32.300
to the man the manufacturer to keep the consumer informed especially with a

01:01:32.300 --> 01:01:36.380
statement as subjective as any violent game well that could be anything I mean

01:01:36.380 --> 01:01:40.460
what who what's violent what's not is a car is Tom and Jerry with a big cartoon

01:01:40.460 --> 01:01:44.420
hair hammer is that violent whack-a-mole the game that's pretty violent

01:01:44.420 --> 01:01:49.900
So I hate I hate hate hate is what I hated about the California law

01:01:49.900 --> 01:01:53.260
I hate these subjective things that lead too much open to interpretation

01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:55.580
so

01:01:55.580 --> 01:01:57.020
alright, well

01:01:57.020 --> 01:01:59.340
That is gonna do it for tonight's program
