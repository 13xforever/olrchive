WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.440
Alright you guys listening live. It's not over yet

00:02.440 --> 00:04.440
We still got a little more show for you guys

00:04.440 --> 00:09.480
Just for you guys because we love the folks who take some time out on their Sunday to spend it with us

00:09.480 --> 00:15.120
We really appreciate that. So this is the orange lounge radio after birth. It's just for you guys

00:17.480 --> 00:23.480
First we'll go around and we'll talk about our weeks and our days starting off with Dark Sakura. How was your week? How was your day?

00:23.800 --> 00:27.120
yesterday I went to San Jose to the Rosary Museum and

00:27.120 --> 00:36.120
and, uh, looked at dead things, which, uh, I've posted, uh, pictures, uh, previously in the chatroom, I can do it again, just a few that I took,

00:36.120 --> 00:48.120
and then went out to, uh, buy lots of Pocky for people in Alabama, and then, um, went on to, uh, eat dinner at the Hard Rock Cafe, and I did schoolwork all the rest of the time.

00:48.120 --> 00:56.120
And I got my new driver's license, and my face is no longer humongous on it, because it's 80 pounds less of me.

00:57.120 --> 00:58.120
That was pretty exciting.

00:58.120 --> 00:59.120
Congratulations, yeah.

00:59.120 --> 01:03.120
And so, just otherwise getting things ready to go to Alabama.

01:03.120 --> 01:05.120
Looking forward to the trip.

01:06.120 --> 01:07.120
That's really it.

01:08.120 --> 01:09.120
All right.

01:09.120 --> 01:11.120
Loki, how was your week? How was your day?

01:11.120 --> 01:14.120
My week was busy with wedding stuff.

01:14.120 --> 01:29.120
And, um, yeah, that's pretty much it. You know, wedding stuff, we were trying to get, um, we went and met with the rabbi yesterday to finalize how the ceremony's gonna go, and, yeah, that's pretty much it.

01:30.120 --> 01:37.120
It's been really busy, so. Sorry, I was just making sure the podcast saved okay. A little bit of Jamie's voice got thrown in there, sorry.

01:37.120 --> 02:03.120
My week and my day, it was pretty good. I've just been doing lots of different things, trying to catch up on a lot of stuff before I go out on my trip, and a lot of work-busy stuff, and just having some nice evenings, and kind of out of the gaming circle this week, but it's okay.

02:03.120 --> 02:07.120
Okay, I don't have to be about video games 24-7.

02:07.120 --> 02:11.120
I'm trying to think if I saw any really good movies or anything I want to share.

02:11.120 --> 02:15.120
I did see Donnie Darko, which is a movie a lot of people seem to really like.

02:15.120 --> 02:19.120
I kind of fell in and out of sleep, though, watching it.

02:19.120 --> 02:21.120
Not the movie's fault, my fault, because I stayed up really late.

02:21.120 --> 02:23.120
Oh, I know something I did, speaking of staying up late.

02:23.120 --> 02:27.120
Last night I went to San Jose and participated in the Rocky Horror Picture Show,

02:27.120 --> 02:29.120
which was a lot of fun.

02:29.120 --> 02:36.120
because my ex-girlfriend, I guess ex-girlfriend, is with a cast still over there in San Jose

02:36.120 --> 02:42.120
and we still talk to each other and she wanted to know if I was interested in helping them out

02:42.120 --> 02:46.120
because they needed somebody for a role and I was like, well shit, I haven't done Rocky in over a year

02:46.120 --> 02:48.120
so I went and did that and that was a lot of fun.

02:48.120 --> 02:51.120
But the only bummer about that is that I drove back after Rocky was over.

02:51.120 --> 02:56.120
Rocky starts at midnight and then so I got on the road at 2.30 and didn't get home until about 5 o'clock.

02:56.120 --> 03:01.120
But oh well. As long as my body doesn't reject it.

03:01.120 --> 03:04.120
Alright, yeah, I knew that would happen. Somebody in the chat room is going,

03:04.120 --> 03:09.120
Ha ha ha, girlfriend. Yeah, well, you know. I have a long, sordid past that

03:09.120 --> 03:13.120
I'm not going into right now on this radio show.

03:13.120 --> 03:17.120
Alright. Let's get into the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match.

03:17.120 --> 03:22.120

03:22.120 --> 03:25.600
And you want to be in our chat room if you want to participate

03:25.600 --> 03:29.720

03:29.880 --> 03:32.880

03:42.080 --> 03:43.040
Wakecase match works

03:43.040 --> 03:49.160
We picked three songs for you guys you guys pick your favorite and the winning song goes in rotation all week long

03:49.160 --> 03:53.880
you're on orange lounge radios the Bonnie and video game music program last

03:53.880 --> 03:58.400
week Dark Sakura won and she decided to get a little creative and use a song

03:58.400 --> 04:02.480
that kind of got popular by in the group which is kind of almost like

04:02.480 --> 04:06.720
sideswiping us in a way I don't know but nevertheless it really had to do with

04:06.720 --> 04:11.040
about her love for MC front a lot more than anything so you guys decided you

04:11.040 --> 04:16.000
like to tune it one last week can it win two weeks in a row we'll see yes here's

04:16.000 --> 04:21.000
Here's a clip. Which MC was that? Last week's winner here on the Orange Lunch Radio Stage Match.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.800
I got a feather like a pimp showing up on the side

04:48.800 --> 04:50.800
MC Chicken in the hat got pride

04:50.800 --> 04:52.800
But I can't recall if it was in my night

04:52.800 --> 04:54.800
It was MC Prime, bye bye

04:54.800 --> 04:56.800
Was it MC Razzle-Bazzle? Was it MC Plain?

04:56.800 --> 04:59.800
Was it MC In the Mirror aka MC Vane?

04:59.800 --> 05:01.800
Was it MC Tane in my ears just to listen?

05:01.800 --> 05:04.800
Nah, if it was him I wouldn't miss him

05:04.800 --> 05:06.800
Was it MC Elephant? That would be relevant

05:06.800 --> 05:08.800
Cause of how my memory got crooked now it's hella bad

05:08.800 --> 05:10.800
Let me think, I'mma figure out

05:10.800 --> 05:12.800
What MC are they talking about?

05:12.800 --> 05:14.800
Which MC was that? I can't recollect

05:14.800 --> 05:18.800
I heard him on the internet and it was MC Puff or somethin' but I didn't hit save

05:18.800 --> 05:20.800
Which MC was that? I couldn't say

05:25.800 --> 05:29.800
Maybe it was MC Matter of Fact, he got the authenticity, easy ridin' his act

05:29.800 --> 05:31.800
Always speakin' the truth, never fronts one bit

05:31.800 --> 05:33.800
He and CJ so sincere, don't quit

05:33.800 --> 05:35.800
But I think for some reason that it wasn't him

05:35.800 --> 05:38.800
Wait, was it MC out on our limb with a very risky raffin'

05:38.800 --> 05:40.800
Don't know what happened to the time

05:40.800 --> 05:43.800
Verbal contortion is squeezin', tongue portion's sublime on the mic

05:43.800 --> 05:47.640
on the mic, except for when the bowels breakin', nicked him out the lineup, mistaked him, yo,

05:47.640 --> 05:52.640
it was definitely MC wrong, rockin' jam after jam of inaccurate songs, then again they could've

05:52.640 --> 05:57.460
been MC in sight, strikein' proper stone blind with a lyrical light, must confess, I'm hard

05:57.460 --> 06:02.080
pressed to be certain, wasn't MC hot, hot curtain callin', pay no attention to the man

06:02.080 --> 06:06.180
on the mic, must be a wizard when he rhymes so tight, you're havin' difficulty dredgin'

06:06.180 --> 06:11.480
out your brain, the fact to which MC was that, which MC was that, I can't recollect, I heard

06:11.480 --> 06:15.160
on the internet and it was MC front for somethin' but I didn't hit save

06:15.160 --> 06:17.240
which MC was that? I couldn't say

06:18.440 --> 06:19.240
I couldn't say

06:21.320 --> 06:25.720
step up point X to act smarter than you are about to pull the MC name out the jar

06:25.720 --> 06:30.200
and whoever gets closest wins a nine-sided die and a gift certificate to prize, yo

06:30.200 --> 06:34.440
the moniker is MC front a lot I got a plus one bag of nerdcore hip hop

06:34.440 --> 06:36.920
and my mail list busted a hundred some famous

06:36.920 --> 06:38.920
It's unbelievable, nobody know what my name is

07:06.920 --> 07:11.240
I decided to pick a song from a free CD I got this week.

07:11.240 --> 07:15.600
I actually ordered some Echo Image CDs from a different drum, and I was very happy because

07:15.600 --> 07:18.520
they're B-sides, and I love new Echo Image songs, and I'm very happy.

07:18.520 --> 07:22.960
But they also sent me a free synth-pop sampler, and that made me happy, so I got to hear some

07:22.960 --> 07:24.800
new stuff, try some different bands out.

07:24.800 --> 07:26.120
And I liked this song.

07:26.120 --> 07:29.600
I love the melody in this song, and that's why I'm picking this song.

07:29.600 --> 07:32.600
The singing's a little odd to me, but maybe you guys will like it.

07:32.600 --> 07:35.920
I love the melody, and I think it's a great song, so I want to share it with you guys.

07:35.920 --> 07:42.960
My pick for tonight's cage match is a group called Liquid Divine, and the song is called

07:42.960 --> 07:43.960
Lotus.

07:43.960 --> 07:45.960
So enjoy song number two tonight.

08:13.960 --> 08:27.960
Within the night that lay inside

08:27.960 --> 08:32.960
You were a virgin in my mind

08:32.960 --> 08:36.960
So every day is a takeaway

08:36.960 --> 08:40.960
We are the souls of decay

08:40.960 --> 08:44.960
And all these years that have been fine

08:44.960 --> 08:49.960
And you bewildered in my eye

08:49.960 --> 08:53.960
And if these seconds have been fine

08:53.960 --> 08:58.960
I really will turn in your eyes

09:00.960 --> 09:04.960
See the hands of faces

09:04.960 --> 09:08.960
Drown to hear this crowd

09:08.960 --> 09:12.960
Grab the absolution

09:13.960 --> 09:16.960
I'm afraid it hurts

09:16.960 --> 09:20.960
The creature colours in your eyes

09:21.960 --> 09:25.960
Touched by a floating light to see

09:26.960 --> 09:30.960
Why your hands and misery

09:30.960 --> 09:35.960
Silent voice and into light

09:52.960 --> 09:56.960
Even though I come underwater

09:56.960 --> 10:00.960
To this this is what we're on

10:00.960 --> 10:05.960
The light has left but not to say

10:05.960 --> 10:09.960
We are in love with everything

10:09.960 --> 10:14.960
My heart is frozen in white skies

10:14.960 --> 10:18.960
Waiting for the day we'll rise

10:18.960 --> 10:22.960
By burning roses high as sand

10:22.960 --> 10:27.960
We will know what's on the Earth

10:28.960 --> 10:33.960
See the wits of the faces

10:33.960 --> 10:37.960
Thrown beneath its blood

10:37.960 --> 10:41.960
Grab the absolution

10:41.960 --> 10:45.960
I'm afraid it hurts

10:45.960 --> 10:50.960
The fragile colors within your eyes

10:50.960 --> 10:55.960
Touched by the melting light to see

10:55.960 --> 10:59.960
Why your head is a misery

10:59.960 --> 11:02.960
Tired and worried

11:02.960 --> 11:06.680
We've denied his smile

12:02.960 --> 12:31.800
Song number two in tonight's Cat Age match, that was Liquid Divine with Lotus.

12:31.800 --> 12:38.040
go around and see if the host thought it was divine or uh just kind of liquid poop uh dark

12:38.040 --> 12:45.240
sakura made me freaky it was pretty though all right loki it was like a seven i didn't care for

12:45.240 --> 12:50.200
the synthy voices but the music was good yeah that's my problem with the song too is i hate

12:50.200 --> 12:55.560
the share effect on the voice like way overdone like five times like i think like if uh it could

12:55.560 --> 12:59.960
be i think at the same time like a trans girl singing that would be too cliche so i think

12:59.960 --> 13:03.320
The guy had just sang with his normal voice. I bet it would have been like a real kick-ass song

13:03.320 --> 13:10.560
But for me the the way the synths are done put it in that very dreamy music to F2 category

13:11.760 --> 13:16.880
So, um, I get you know, since it is the season and everything with Valentine's Day being on Tuesday

13:16.880 --> 13:20.320
I'm gonna go ahead and give that song a 9 where it's usually I would have given that an 8

13:20.560 --> 13:24.680
You know if it's the holiday, I give myself a bonus point. All right a

13:24.680 --> 13:27.680
Alright, Loki, what did you pick for your song tonight?

13:27.680 --> 13:32.680
I picked a song by a group called Evergreen called The End.

13:32.680 --> 13:34.680
It's completely picked out of random.

13:34.680 --> 13:38.680
I just picked it up completely at random.

13:38.680 --> 13:39.680
I have no idea if it's good or bad.

13:39.680 --> 13:41.680
So, hope it's good.

13:41.680 --> 13:43.680
Will minimal effort pay off?

13:43.680 --> 13:46.680
We'll find out with song number three, Evergreen with The End.

13:46.680 --> 13:48.680
And, you're on the gate match.

17:16.680 --> 17:46.520
Song number three tonight, Evergreen with The End, a last minute pick by Loki, the last

17:46.520 --> 17:51.120
minute miss payoff we'll find out dark soccer it sounds like the background

17:51.120 --> 17:55.720
music to some sort of airplane game which I love airplane games but it was

17:55.720 --> 18:02.240
kind of boring they get the poor Loki that was a horrible song I don't know

18:02.240 --> 18:08.240
what the hell I was thinking tell me something to be in the groove so I don't

18:08.240 --> 18:14.200
know I have to eat it'll probably win five just because it was really

18:14.200 --> 18:17.960
repetitive I'm gonna be a little bit nicer to the song because I could I

18:17.960 --> 18:22.320
really could see that song like in a video game my problem with it is that it

18:22.320 --> 18:26.200
sounds like it was done on somebody's keyboard in their basement like the

18:26.200 --> 18:30.720
sound quality of it was not quite fleshed out like take my song that I put

18:30.720 --> 18:34.160
in tonight chances are a lot of those indie synthpop fans probably did write

18:34.160 --> 18:36.880
those songs in their basement but that's not sound like it was done to me

18:36.880 --> 18:39.960
basement the melody was very fleshed out and stuff they think if that song was

18:39.960 --> 18:43.040
done with slightly better production values it might have been worth my time

18:43.040 --> 18:49.280
time but for now it gets a six four five six there it wins there was all right

18:49.280 --> 18:55.720
but it's not up to us it's up to you you guys in chat to vote for your favorite

18:55.720 --> 18:59.120

19:45.040 --> 19:46.520
will be flogged repeatedly.

19:46.520 --> 19:49.160
Anybody watching the Olympics?

19:49.160 --> 19:50.160
Nope.

19:50.160 --> 19:51.560
I don't watch TV.

19:51.560 --> 19:52.560
Not even the Olympics?

19:52.560 --> 19:54.560
I know some people that don't give a crap about sports.

19:54.560 --> 19:57.200
I wish Miklotov was still here because I know he's one of those people who doesn't give

19:57.200 --> 20:00.600
a crap about sports, but will watch the Olympics when they come on because, I don't know, there's

20:00.600 --> 20:05.360
There's something, I don't know, there's something different about the Olympics, all that culture

20:05.360 --> 20:07.420
and all those different types of sports being played.

20:07.420 --> 20:08.420
You don't watch them?

20:08.420 --> 20:09.420
Nope?

20:09.420 --> 20:10.420
No?

20:10.420 --> 20:11.900
In Dark Sakura, you don't even watch this stuff?

20:11.900 --> 20:15.900
I know you don't watch TV, but not even though you say you don't watch TV, you do make a

20:15.900 --> 20:18.400
rare exception, though, because you do watch Buffy, you watch-

20:18.400 --> 20:20.460
Buffy's been off the air for a year now.

20:20.460 --> 20:23.740
Right, but there's been other, I know there's been stuff here and there, I'm just curious

20:23.740 --> 20:25.780
if the Olympics is an exception.

20:25.780 --> 20:27.780
I guess not.

20:27.780 --> 20:37.780
Well, I do like figure skating. I've loved figure skating all the time because my mom used to do amateur roller skating and I said it was a little bit.

20:37.780 --> 20:50.780
But really, I do not put TV as, this is just my opinion of it, I'm not saying anyone else says this, I don't think of my television as my number one source of entertainment.

20:50.780 --> 20:54.980
So therefore, even though there may be a show I might be interested in or the Olympics or

20:54.980 --> 20:58.220
something big going on, I don't think of it as TV.

20:58.220 --> 21:00.460
I look online for the news.

21:00.460 --> 21:01.460
Okay.

21:01.460 --> 21:02.460
The results.

21:02.460 --> 21:06.660
It's never been a big thing to just sit and watch it, you know.

21:06.660 --> 21:07.980
Figure skating might be kind of boring this year anyway.

21:07.980 --> 21:09.220
I heard Michelle Kwan pulled out.

21:09.220 --> 21:11.260
She's always usually the best one to watch.

21:11.260 --> 21:13.900
They had a date my mom marathon on today.

21:13.900 --> 21:15.460
God, please don't tell me you watched that.

21:15.460 --> 21:20.300
I watched about two episodes of that because I couldn't reach the remote from where I was

21:20.300 --> 21:29.900
City. That show is horribly scripted. I mean, I hate anything that they call reality TV

21:29.900 --> 21:36.460
on MTV because just like the crap that they were making them say was so ridiculous. Like

21:36.460 --> 21:44.460
where they ask him like, you know, so tell me about her camel toe and then like, you

21:44.460 --> 21:49.100
know, the mother won't understand. She'll think, oh, you're talking about my daughter's

21:49.100 --> 21:58.100
pinky toe that's turned sideways or something. Oh, that's her camel toe. Or like, you know, this one, it has this gay one on it today, and he's like,

21:58.100 --> 22:05.100
so yeah, do you think your son would mind if I gave him a pearl necklace? Oh, that's disgusting. Why would you say that to somebody's mother?

22:05.100 --> 22:18.100
And she's like, well, I don't know if he looks good in pearls, but, uh, it was just like completely retarded. I mean, come on. There was this other guy who wanted to sniff, like, the mother's, like, armpits because he had this, like, smell fetish thing.

22:18.100 --> 22:20.080
finish than you are

22:20.080 --> 22:23.300
so the crap it's on t-v i didn't like you don't think you know what though

22:23.300 --> 22:27.500
there is there is a very very famous clip that comes from date my mom

22:27.500 --> 22:30.620
like harry potter with a vagina

22:30.620 --> 22:32.480
and i was from date my mom

22:32.480 --> 22:33.340
yeah

22:33.340 --> 22:35.700
that's retarded stuff but

22:35.700 --> 22:39.380
i did like the soup in their curious george

22:39.380 --> 22:41.940
that was great

22:41.940 --> 22:46.660
although we know it over here is a put george w bush and instead of people

22:46.660 --> 22:49.860
Yeah, the soup's pretty good. That soup's probably my favorite show on TV.

22:49.860 --> 22:55.060
And what I like about it is that it takes all the funny clips from other shows and puts them together.

22:55.060 --> 22:58.560
So it's like, it's Cliff Notes for TV, for pop culture.

22:58.560 --> 23:02.760
I love it. There's a couple movies I've been looking at that I want to see.

23:02.760 --> 23:07.860
They're coming out, Ultraviolet looks pretty sweet, kind of like another Matrix-type movie.

23:07.860 --> 23:09.860
Which, I don't know, it looks pretty sweet.

23:09.860 --> 23:16.060
And then, Scary Movie 4. As much as I didn't really care for Scary Movie 3, Scary Movie 4 looks funny.

23:16.060 --> 23:20.060
Because there's a giant iPod that destroys the world, and that's so completely true.

23:20.060 --> 23:22.060
It's near and dear to your heart, isn't it?

23:22.060 --> 23:28.060
You know what's funny? Speaking of that movie there, we saw this interesting marquee at Rocky last night and took a picture of it there.

23:28.060 --> 23:32.060
See, look, somebody meant to, like, they have all the movies that are playing at the plaza there.

23:32.060 --> 23:42.060
They have, like, Pink Panther, Nanny McVie, Curious George, and they have coming soon, 8 Below, and then look at this, Ultra Violate.

23:42.060 --> 23:48.740
Jamie can appreciate this one because she's a grammar Nazi there ultra violate the movie is supposed to be ultraviolet, right?

23:49.060 --> 23:51.060
They put ultraviolet

23:51.460 --> 23:55.040
There should be a movie called ultraviolet, you know, he's a porno

23:55.040 --> 23:59.460
I'm sorry that I poked at you in your life journal, by the way, speaking of grammar. That's all right

23:59.460 --> 24:05.460
I don't even know what I did, but I did because I as a subject. Oh, I gave you a collective eye roll

24:05.460 --> 24:14.460
Because you used I as a subject. When you said me and I. No, he's him and I. You used it as a subject. It should have been him and me.

24:14.460 --> 24:16.460
Oh, my bad.

24:16.460 --> 24:18.460
Jamie's grammar lesson of the night.

24:18.460 --> 24:23.460
Grammar tip of the week. That's what you need on the podcast because you got rid of it.

24:23.460 --> 24:25.460
A grammar tip of the week. Yeah.

24:25.460 --> 24:29.460
We've got to get rid of the website and get your grammar tip of the week instead. What's the thing about that?

24:29.460 --> 24:30.460
Rock.

24:30.460 --> 24:32.460
If we do go on a little break here, maybe that could be something.

24:32.460 --> 24:36.460
Remember, an apostrophe does not make it plural.

24:36.460 --> 24:40.460
That would be, that is very useful for kids that write on web forums and stuff.

24:40.460 --> 24:44.460
You need to look into this. I think we have something developing here.

24:44.460 --> 24:48.460
We'll see. Or I could do it. It would be ironic

24:48.460 --> 24:52.460
if I did it because I have the worst grammar in the world.

24:52.460 --> 24:56.460
I've read your email. Yeah, but I write, you know, I'm fast.

24:56.460 --> 25:00.460
I write good at work because I'll take time to spell check

25:00.460 --> 25:02.220
grammar check and all that good stuff, but when I'm writing

25:02.220 --> 25:04.980
informally, as I do in my live journal, I don't bother.

25:04.980 --> 25:06.620
It's like, whatever.

25:06.620 --> 25:07.940
All righty.

25:07.940 --> 25:10.740
By the way, big thank you to Bugged, who I think was the

25:10.740 --> 25:13.940
one that pointed that out and made my buddy Jason take a

25:13.940 --> 25:15.180
picture of that.

25:17.860 --> 25:18.340
Let's see.

25:18.340 --> 25:18.780
Oh, yeah.

25:18.780 --> 25:23.260
Somebody in chat room says, Sky write good.

25:23.260 --> 25:25.100
I've got to tally up cage match votes here.

25:25.100 --> 25:27.260
Somebody's got to talk about a completely different subject.

25:27.260 --> 25:29.620
Loki, do you have any podcast articles that

25:29.620 --> 25:36.460
make the cut tonight um maybe I don't know um I'm just looking they have like

25:36.460 --> 25:40.580
something on DJ max portable you know the one that was coming out on the PSP

25:40.580 --> 25:44.340
it's kind of beatmania but they have like something that says George W Bush

25:44.340 --> 25:49.100
video so I have to really watch this to see what exactly they're talking about

25:49.100 --> 25:56.860
because it'd be interesting but um I don't know I'm just trying to think of

25:56.860 --> 26:01.780
like stuff that's going on. There are some games I forgot to mention that were

26:01.780 --> 26:09.920
coming out this week. Grandia 3 and Exit for the PSP. Well, Grandia 3 is for the

26:09.920 --> 26:16.180
PS2. What else was there? There's some Yu-Gi-Oh 2 for 1 that was also coming out

26:16.180 --> 26:24.520
but I don't play Yu-Gi-Oh so who cares? And then, I don't know. Lots of good games coming out in March

26:24.520 --> 26:33.520
including that really crappy game Dance Factory, the one by Codemasters, where you put any CD in and it'll make DDR steps for it.

26:33.520 --> 26:39.520
I'm worried about this game. Yeah, it looks like crap. I'm sure it is.

26:39.520 --> 26:45.520
And there's a new Monster Rancher game coming out. Oh, yay!

26:45.520 --> 26:48.520
Because, you know, we love those games. And then, um...

26:50.520 --> 26:53.520
I don't know. I'm trying to think of really good games coming out.

26:53.520 --> 26:54.520
You don't have to fill time anymore.

26:54.520 --> 26:56.520
Bust a move! Bust a move, Alex.

26:56.520 --> 26:58.520
What? What? What? Oh. Never mind.

26:58.520 --> 27:01.520
You got me excited for a minute here because I thought we were talking Kitty Yen.

27:01.520 --> 27:03.520
No. Bummer.

27:06.520 --> 27:11.520
Alright. I did also last night, you know, we had those brochures that were pretty cool.

27:11.520 --> 27:13.500
um... of uh...

27:13.500 --> 27:14.860
there was a damn

27:14.860 --> 27:16.760
that tango game

27:16.760 --> 27:17.820
uh...

27:17.820 --> 27:22.520
extent x tango yeah all did it back in every freaking come out now

27:22.520 --> 27:23.740
but the brochures

27:23.740 --> 27:27.580
they're made of the flake weird stuff that i talked to my fireplace

27:27.580 --> 27:28.400
and they'd like

27:28.400 --> 27:30.060
burst in the flames like

27:30.060 --> 27:33.680
late blew up like jiffy popper some like that i was in the

27:33.680 --> 27:34.460
well

27:34.460 --> 27:37.420
it's just like the huge fire coming out of the world

27:37.420 --> 27:43.420
We were burning things last night and playing Scrabble.

27:43.420 --> 27:47.420
Fire and Scrabble, that's like the best way to spend an evening.

27:47.420 --> 27:48.420
Then Clue.

27:48.420 --> 27:50.420
You know I had a fucking party, Loki.

27:50.420 --> 27:52.420
By the way, I still have Rob's copy of Clue.

27:52.420 --> 27:53.420
God damn it, give it back.

27:53.420 --> 27:54.420
Never.

27:54.420 --> 27:56.420
Because Jason hasn't seen it and needs to.

27:56.420 --> 27:57.420
So at least I think he told me.

27:57.420 --> 27:59.420
You need to watch Advent Children.

27:59.420 --> 28:01.420
I know, I'm going to watch Advent Children.

28:01.420 --> 28:05.420
As a follow up to something we talked about, Loki got me a DVD of Advent Children so I could...

28:05.420 --> 28:12.420
Speaking of having children, remember I posted a new date on their website. It's coming out April 25th in the US.

28:12.420 --> 28:14.420
Sure it is.

28:14.420 --> 28:26.420
Yeah, it's until it gets delayed again. But tentatively, I mean, the pre-booked date on it is in May, or not May, it's April, March, get my months straight here.

28:26.420 --> 28:36.420
So, um, hopefully this is finalized that's coming out, and since I've also heard the rumor that it was coming out in the UK on the 24th, but I think they've denied that now, but...

28:36.420 --> 28:43.420
Loki, for your next fire and scrabble night, um, Roz says, I heard that strawberry Pop-Tarts burst into flames.

28:43.420 --> 28:52.420
Well, I don't have Pop-Tarts. We haven't really burned, like, we just burn our junk mail, and, um, whatever paper we have in the house, usually.

28:52.420 --> 28:59.660
I've been trying to push for burning the phone book, but for some reason she doesn't want

28:59.660 --> 29:00.660
to burn the phone book.

29:00.660 --> 29:07.060
Look at all that free flammable stuff, I mean it's like the size of a log as it is.

29:07.060 --> 29:08.660
That stuff would go up in flames too.

29:08.660 --> 29:13.100
All right, let's reveal tonight's podcast winner, you know who's a, or podcast winner,

29:13.100 --> 29:14.100
CAGEMATCH winner.

29:14.100 --> 29:15.940
I have something else on my brain.

29:15.940 --> 29:20.620
Tonight's CAGEMATCH winner, very interesting CAGEMATCH winner situation tonight because

29:20.620 --> 29:27.620
We had two songs tied, but one song got one more vote than those two songs.

29:27.620 --> 29:30.620
So it was an incredibly close match tonight.

29:30.620 --> 29:32.620
So all songs did very well.

29:32.620 --> 29:34.620
It was damn near a three-way tie.

29:34.620 --> 29:37.620
But in the end, there could only be one winner.

29:37.620 --> 29:40.620
And the winner tonight was...

29:41.620 --> 29:43.620
Believe it or not...

29:43.620 --> 29:46.620
Evergreen with the end.

29:46.620 --> 29:53.520
to which the three of us give a collective huh because we all hated that

29:53.520 --> 29:58.400
song but just goes to show that it doesn't matter what we think ultimately

29:58.400 --> 30:01.160
the chat room can do whatever the fuck they want I think they're just fucking

30:01.160 --> 30:05.600
with us that was our punishment for you doing that Loki good job way to ruin it

30:05.600 --> 30:09.800
Loki dick survive and since we're absence Jamie now will be here next week

30:09.800 --> 30:16.440
that song by default wins two weeks in a row good job Loki wait here lose at the

30:16.440 --> 30:17.440
the internet.

30:17.440 --> 30:18.440
Kill him.

30:18.440 --> 30:19.440
This show is over.

30:19.440 --> 30:20.440
Death by Ferret.

30:20.440 --> 30:21.440
This show is over.

30:21.440 --> 30:22.440
I'm kidding.

30:22.440 --> 30:25.080
Final thoughts.

30:25.080 --> 30:27.360
The extra final thoughts, Loki.

30:27.360 --> 30:32.680
I need to freaking get out of this goddamn writer's block for my music stuff, because

30:32.680 --> 30:36.600
I need to make music, or a song, by the March deadline.

30:36.600 --> 30:39.060
Dr. Sockery, final thoughts.

30:39.060 --> 30:41.480
I like mummies.

30:41.480 --> 30:44.480
I looked at Mummified Cats, remember?

30:44.480 --> 30:52.480
Not if my cats are cool, because when they have their wrappings, they actually stitch little ears onto their wrappings. It was cute.

30:52.480 --> 31:00.480
Dorky. My final thought is bye and I'll see you on March 5th. Bye. I'm going to miss you guys.

31:00.480 --> 31:03.480
I miss you already, Rob, but my aim's improving.

31:03.480 --> 31:06.480
Shut up. I'll see some of our listeners at Katsucon, though. That's going to be exciting.

31:06.480 --> 31:10.480
And I have to make flyers for Katsucon, because I said I would at some point, so we'll do that.

31:10.480 --> 31:13.480
That's it. Here's your porch cookie message for the day.

31:40.480 --> 31:45.480
dedicated to video games and what gamers really want to know.
