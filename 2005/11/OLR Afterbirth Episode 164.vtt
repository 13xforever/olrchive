WEBVTT

00:00.273 --> 00:01.694
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, you guys listening live.

00:01.814 --> 00:02.535
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not over yet.

00:02.575 --> 00:09.640
[SPEAKER_02]: We still got a little more show for you guys, just for you guys, because we love the folks who take some time out on their Sunday to spend it with us.

00:09.760 --> 00:10.800
[SPEAKER_02]: We really appreciate that.

00:11.181 --> 00:13.742
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the Orange Lounge Radio after birth.

00:14.443 --> 00:15.243
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just for you guys.

00:17.847 --> 00:18.087
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura

00:36.178 --> 00:55.707
[SPEAKER_00]: and then went out to buy lots of Pocky for people in Alabama and then went on to eat dinner at the Hard Rock Cafe and I did school work all the rest of the time and I got my new driver's license and my face is no longer humongous on it because it's 80 pounds less of me.

00:57.168 --> 00:58.108
[SPEAKER_00]: That was pretty exciting.

00:58.128 --> 00:59.109
[SPEAKER_05]: Congratulations, yeah.

00:59.729 --> 01:02.970
[SPEAKER_00]: And so just otherwise getting things ready to go to Alabama.

01:03.551 --> 01:04.371
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking forward to the trip.

01:09.183 --> 01:10.024
[SPEAKER_01]: Loki, how was your week?

01:10.044 --> 01:10.424
[SPEAKER_01]: How was your day?

01:23.032 --> 01:25.113
[SPEAKER_01]: To finalize how the ceremony is going to go.

01:26.634 --> 01:29.575
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, that's pretty much it.

01:29.775 --> 01:30.996
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been really busy.

01:32.277 --> 01:34.858
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I was just making sure the podcast saved okay.

01:35.018 --> 01:37.099
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit of Jamie's voice got thrown in there.

01:37.119 --> 01:37.319
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

01:38.440 --> 01:40.441
[SPEAKER_02]: So, okay.

01:41.641 --> 01:44.163
[SPEAKER_02]: My week and my day, it was pretty good.

01:44.383 --> 01:45.643
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, you know, I...

01:48.652 --> 01:49.593
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkDeft, Drew, Carameldansen

02:11.662 --> 02:12.462
[SPEAKER_02]: Donnie Darko

02:32.185 --> 02:35.946
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, ex-girlfriend, is with a cast still over there in San Jose.

02:36.426 --> 02:37.566
[SPEAKER_02]: And we still talk to each other.

02:38.846 --> 02:44.067
[SPEAKER_02]: And she wanted to know if I was interested in helping them out because they needed somebody for a role.

02:44.087 --> 02:46.488
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, well, shit, I haven't done Rocky in over a year.

02:46.548 --> 02:47.288
[SPEAKER_02]: So I went and did that.

02:47.308 --> 02:48.048
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was a lot of fun.

02:48.328 --> 02:51.448
[SPEAKER_02]: But the only bummer about that is that I drove back after Rocky was over.

02:51.488 --> 02:52.429
[SPEAKER_02]: Rocky starts at midnight.

02:52.849 --> 02:55.949
[SPEAKER_02]: And then so I got on the road at 2.30 and didn't get home until about 5 o'clock.

02:56.989 --> 02:57.389
[SPEAKER_02]: But oh well.

02:58.830 --> 03:00.290
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as my body doesn't reject it.

03:01.260 --> 03:02.521
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, yeah, I knew that would happen.

03:02.561 --> 03:05.063
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody in the chat room is going, ha, ha, ha, girlfriend.

03:05.584 --> 03:11.349
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, well, you know, I have a long, sordid past that I'm not going into right now on this radio show.

03:13.370 --> 03:16.953
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's get into the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match.

03:16.994 --> 03:21.437
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the part of the show where we play songs for your enjoyment, hopefully.

03:22.939 --> 03:25.701
[SPEAKER_02]: And you want to be in our chat room if you want to participate.

03:25.741 --> 03:27.563
[SPEAKER_02]: I know some of you guys like to lurk out there.

03:27.603 --> 03:28.964
[SPEAKER_02]: You're listening, but you're not in chat room.

03:29.312 --> 03:29.872
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's fine.

03:30.312 --> 03:32.953
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, you have a right to your anonymity.

03:33.874 --> 03:37.595
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you want to be able to participate and choose the winner, you do have to be in our chat room.

03:37.635 --> 03:39.856
[SPEAKER_02]: It's over at www.orangelandre.com.

03:39.876 --> 03:40.456
[SPEAKER_02]: Click on chat.

03:40.756 --> 03:41.516
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get it started.

03:42.176 --> 03:45.357
[SPEAKER_02]: The way a cage match works, we pick three songs for you guys.

03:45.397 --> 03:49.419
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys pick your favorite, and the winning song goes into rotation all week long.

03:49.799 --> 03:53.140
[SPEAKER_02]: You're on Orange Lounge Radio's Labani and Video Game Music program.

03:53.740 --> 03:58.782
[SPEAKER_02]: Last week, DarkSakura won, and she decided to get a little creative and use a song that

03:59.096 --> 03:59.716
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

04:28.707 --> 04:39.438
[SPEAKER_03]: Was MC something or something, but I didn't hit save Which MC was that, I couldn't say Wait a minute, was it MC Chicken in the hat?

04:39.538 --> 04:42.100
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember him, he was a fat dude Wait, was he thin?

04:42.120 --> 04:52.891
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I know I've seen his video Up on the box with the dirty ass beaks Calling Rooster's car, got a feather like a pimp Swingin' up on the side MC Chicken in the hat got pride But I can't recall if it was in my night

04:55.084 --> 04:56.145
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it MC Razzle Dazzle?

04:56.165 --> 04:57.226
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it MC Plain?

04:57.246 --> 04:59.948
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it MC in the mirror, aka MC Vain?

04:59.988 --> 05:02.289
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it MC pain in my ears just to listen?

05:02.670 --> 05:05.652
[SPEAKER_03]: Nah, if it was him, I wouldn't listen Was it MC Elephant?

05:05.672 --> 05:12.377
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be relevant Because of how my memory got crooked, now it's Halibut Let me think, I'ma figure out What MC are they talking about?

05:12.577 --> 05:13.838
[SPEAKER_03]: Which MC was that?

05:13.898 --> 05:20.362
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't recollect I heard him on the internet Was MC Fuss or something, but I didn't hit save Which MC was that?

05:20.402 --> 05:21.043
[SPEAKER_03]: I couldn't say

05:25.603 --> 05:29.564
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it was MC, matter of fact, he got the authentic, easy riding his act.

05:29.705 --> 05:31.805
[SPEAKER_03]: Always speaking the truth, never fronts one bit.

05:31.825 --> 05:33.946
[SPEAKER_03]: He and DJ so sincere, don't quit.

05:34.006 --> 05:36.207
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think for some reason that it wasn't him.

05:36.427 --> 05:39.568
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, was it MC out on a limb with a very risky rapping?

05:39.588 --> 05:41.229
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't know what happened to the time.

05:41.289 --> 05:41.849
[SPEAKER_03]: Verbal control.

05:41.949 --> 05:42.610
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

05:57.836 --> 06:19.386
[SPEAKER_03]: to be certain, was it MC Hot behind the curtain, calling, pay no attention to the man on the mic, must be a wizard when he runs so tight, you're having difficulty judging out your brain, the fact, which MC was that, which MC was that, I can't recollect, I heard him on the internet, was MC Hot or something, but I didn't hit save, which MC was that, I couldn't say, I couldn't say.

06:21.564 --> 06:39.162
[SPEAKER_03]: Step up Poindex to act smarter than you are About to pull the MC name out the jar And whoever gets closest wins a nine-sided die And a gift certificate to prize, yo The moniker is MC Front a lot I got a fuss one bag, a nerdcore hip-hop And my mail list busted, a hundred so I'm famous It's unbelievable nobody know what my name is

06:50.363 --> 06:52.527
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, that was a clip from song number one.

06:52.567 --> 06:55.250
[SPEAKER_02]: That was MC Frontalot with which MC was that?

06:55.270 --> 06:56.452
[SPEAKER_02]: It was last week's winner.

06:56.993 --> 07:02.541
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just might win again this week, but first, it's got to go up against a couple of other songs.

07:02.581 --> 07:04.083
[SPEAKER_02]: The first song is going to be my pick.

07:04.724 --> 07:06.066
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right, I get to pick the next song.

07:06.713 --> 07:11.175
[SPEAKER_02]: and I decided to pick a song from a free CD I got this week.

07:11.495 --> 07:17.677
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually ordered some Echo Image CDs from a different drum and I was very happy because there's B-sides and I love new Echo Image songs.

07:17.737 --> 07:18.357
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm very, very happy.

07:18.617 --> 07:21.338
[SPEAKER_02]: But they also sent me a free synth pop sampler.

07:21.758 --> 07:24.439
[SPEAKER_02]: That made me happy, so I got to hear some new stuff, try some different bands out.

07:24.759 --> 07:25.840
[SPEAKER_02]: And I liked this song.

07:26.220 --> 07:29.541
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the melody in this song and that's why I'm picking this song.

07:29.581 --> 07:32.042
[SPEAKER_02]: The singing's a little odd to me, but maybe you guys will like it.

07:32.482 --> 07:35.383
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the melody and I think it's a great song, so I want to share it with you guys.

07:35.899 --> 07:39.280
[SPEAKER_02]: My pick for tonight's cage match is a song called Liquid Divine.

07:39.380 --> 07:43.401
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, the group is called Liquid Divine, and the song is called Lotus.

07:43.861 --> 07:45.881
[SPEAKER_02]: So enjoy song number two tonight.

07:45.901 --> 07:48.502
[SPEAKER_02]: Liquid Divine

08:05.427 --> 08:06.708
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

08:36.130 --> 08:45.820
We are the souls of decay, and all these years that have passed by, and you bewildered in my eye, and in these seconds satisfied, I really will tell you.

09:14.742 --> 09:15.542
DarkSakura, DarkSakura

09:46.403 --> 09:53.665
We made our icons on the wall To do today's decisions for what we're for Life and death are not to say We are

10:11.773 --> 10:13.095
Thanks for watching!

10:40.289 --> 10:41.312
Thanks for watching!

11:39.472 --> 11:40.272
Thanks for watching!

12:26.892 --> 12:31.634
[SPEAKER_02]: Song number two in tonight's Cat Age match, that was Liquid Divine with Lotus.

12:31.694 --> 12:36.935
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go around and see if the hosts thought it was Divine or just kind of Liquid Poop.

12:37.916 --> 12:38.636
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.

12:39.156 --> 12:40.216
[SPEAKER_00]: Made me sleepy.

12:40.336 --> 12:41.377
[SPEAKER_00]: It was pretty, though.

12:41.617 --> 12:43.397
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, Loki.

12:43.557 --> 12:44.258
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like a seven.

12:44.298 --> 12:48.019
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't care for the synthy voices, but the music was good.

12:48.759 --> 12:53.361
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my problem with this song, too, is I hate the share effect on the voice, like way overdone, like five times.

12:53.661 --> 12:54.621
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I think, like, if a...

12:55.519 --> 12:59.200
[SPEAKER_02]: But see, I think at the same time, like a trance girl singing that would be too cliche.

12:59.700 --> 13:03.380
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think if the guy had just sang with his normal voice, I bet it would have been like a real kick-ass song.

13:03.680 --> 13:10.642
[SPEAKER_02]: But for me, the way the synths are done, put it in that very dreamy music to F2 category.

13:12.102 --> 13:18.543
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, since it is the season and everything with Valentine's Day being on Tuesday, I'm going to go ahead and give that song a 9.

13:18.943 --> 13:20.503
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas usually I would have given that an 8.

13:20.963 --> 13:23.624
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, since it fits the holiday, I give myself a bonus point.

13:24.044 --> 13:24.284
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

13:25.893 --> 13:27.674
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, Loki, what did you pick for your song tonight?

13:28.555 --> 13:32.958
[SPEAKER_01]: I picked a song by a group called Evergreen, called The End.

13:33.378 --> 13:35.359
[SPEAKER_01]: It's completely picked out of random.

13:35.499 --> 13:38.861
[SPEAKER_01]: I just picked it up completely at random.

13:39.142 --> 13:40.382
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no idea if it's good or bad.

13:40.602 --> 13:41.763
[SPEAKER_02]: So, hope it's good.

13:42.203 --> 13:43.644
[SPEAKER_02]: Will minimal effort pay off?

13:43.684 --> 13:46.926
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll find out with song number three, Evergreen, with The End.

13:47.187 --> 13:47.867
[SPEAKER_02]: You're on the Cavematch.

16:49.299 --> 16:50.040
Thanks for watching!

17:40.894 --> 17:44.175
[SPEAKER_02]: Song number three tonight, Evergreen with The End.

17:44.255 --> 17:45.676
[SPEAKER_02]: A last minute pick by Loki.

17:45.996 --> 17:47.737
[SPEAKER_02]: Did the last minute-ness pay off?

17:47.777 --> 17:49.117
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll find out, DarkSakura.

17:49.917 --> 17:52.798
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like the background music to some sort of airplane game.

17:53.699 --> 17:56.860
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, which I love airplane games, but it was kind of boring.

17:57.580 --> 17:58.381
[SPEAKER_00]: They get the core.

17:59.221 --> 17:59.601
[SPEAKER_01]: Loki.

18:00.441 --> 18:01.742
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a horrible song.

18:01.942 --> 18:03.402
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what the hell I was thinking.

18:03.783 --> 18:05.743
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds like something that would be in the groove, so.

18:08.164 --> 18:08.564
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

18:08.584 --> 18:10.145
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to be sure it'll probably win.

18:12.937 --> 18:21.001
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna be a little bit nicer to the song because I could, I really could see that song like in a video game.

18:21.041 --> 18:25.523
[SPEAKER_02]: My problem with it is that it sounds like it was done on somebody's keyboard in their basement.

18:25.922 --> 18:27.182
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching.

18:27.202 --> 18:27.662
[SPEAKER_02]: See you next time.

18:54.019 --> 18:55.761
[SPEAKER_02]: in chat to vote for your favorite.

18:55.801 --> 18:58.623
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's a recap in case you're not sure what to vote for tonight.

18:58.683 --> 19:00.845
[SPEAKER_02]: Song number one you can vote for is MC Frontalot.

19:01.265 --> 19:02.166
[SPEAKER_02]: Which MC was that?

19:02.466 --> 19:06.990
[SPEAKER_03]: And song number two you can vote for tonight is Liquid Divine with Lotus.

19:24.885 --> 19:29.009
[SPEAKER_02]: And song number three you can vote for tonight is Evergreen with The End.

19:37.396 --> 19:40.539

[SPEAKER_02]: Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.

19:43.521 --> 19:46.424
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you don't, you will be flogged repeatedly.

19:48.105 --> 19:49.046
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody watching the Olympics?

19:50.134 --> 19:50.735
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't watch TV.

19:51.436 --> 19:52.217
[SPEAKER_02]: Not even the Olympics?

19:52.278 --> 19:54.522
[SPEAKER_02]: I know some people that don't give a crap about sports.

19:54.542 --> 19:56.465
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish Mikhail Tav was still here because I know he's one of those people.

19:56.826 --> 19:59.892
[SPEAKER_02]: Doesn't give a crap about sports, but will watch the Olympics when they come on.

19:59.912 --> 20:01.034
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, I don't know, there's something...

20:02.739 --> 20:02.999
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

20:32.471 --> 20:56.012
[SPEAKER_00]: I've loved figure skating all the time because my mom used to do amateur roller skating and I studied it a little bit but really I've just not I do not put TV this is just my opinion of it I'm not saying anyone else says this I don't think of my television as my number one source of entertainment so therefore even though there may be a show I might be interested in or the Olympics or something big going on

20:56.644 --> 20:58.205
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think of it as TV.

20:58.285 --> 21:00.005
[SPEAKER_00]: I look online for the news.

21:01.566 --> 21:02.146
[SPEAKER_00]: The results.

21:03.087 --> 21:05.508
[SPEAKER_00]: It's never been a big thing to just sit and watch it.

21:06.528 --> 21:08.029
[SPEAKER_02]: Figure skating might be kind of boring this year anyway.

21:08.049 --> 21:09.129
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard Michelle Kwan pulled out.

21:09.169 --> 21:10.370
[SPEAKER_02]: She's always usually the best one to watch.

21:11.210 --> 21:13.871
[SPEAKER_01]: They had a Date My Mom marathon on today.

21:14.051 --> 21:15.312
[SPEAKER_02]: God, please don't tell me you watched that.

21:15.532 --> 21:20.734
[SPEAKER_01]: I watched about two episodes of that because I couldn't reach the remote from where I was sitting.

21:20.754 --> 21:21.335
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

21:24.014 --> 21:27.298
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, um... That show is horribly scripted.

21:27.658 --> 21:31.622
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I hate anything that they call reality TV on MTV.

21:32.043 --> 21:36.047
[SPEAKER_01]: Because just, like, the crap that they were making them say was so ridiculous.

21:36.388 --> 21:40.372
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, where they ask them, like, you know... So, what would...

21:40.868 --> 21:42.389
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for watching!

21:58.840 --> 22:02.243
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, do you think your son would mind if I gave him a pearl necklace?

22:02.703 --> 22:03.724
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's disgusting.

22:03.744 --> 22:05.245
[SPEAKER_01]: Why would you say that to somebody's mother?

22:05.405 --> 22:10.770
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's like, well, I don't know if he looks good in pearls, but, uh, it was just, like, completely retarded.

22:10.830 --> 22:11.731
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, come on.

22:12.571 --> 22:19.077
[SPEAKER_01]: There was this other guy who wanted to sniff, like, the mother's, like, armpits because he had this, like, smell fetish thing.

22:19.177 --> 22:19.357
[SPEAKER_05]: Ew.

22:20.098 --> 22:21.759
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the crap that's on TV.

22:22.019 --> 22:22.920
[SPEAKER_02]: I did like this.

22:22.960 --> 22:23.660
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what, though?

22:23.781 --> 22:26.543
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a very, very famous clip that comes from Date My Mom.

22:27.631 --> 22:29.612
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Harry Potter with a vagina!

22:30.113 --> 22:30.813
[SPEAKER_00]: I love her!

22:30.853 --> 22:31.934
[SPEAKER_01]: That was from Date My Mom.

22:32.614 --> 22:34.355
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's retarded stuff.

22:35.816 --> 22:38.318
[SPEAKER_01]: I did like the soup in their Curious George.

22:39.338 --> 22:40.539
[SPEAKER_01]: That was great.

22:42.220 --> 22:45.282
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, they put George W. Bush in instead.

22:45.322 --> 22:45.963
[SPEAKER_02]: That was pretty funny.

22:46.703 --> 22:47.564
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the soup's pretty good.

22:47.604 --> 22:49.925
[SPEAKER_02]: That soup's probably my favorite show on TV.

22:49.985 --> 22:51.106
[SPEAKER_02]: What I like about it is that

22:51.670 --> 22:52.490
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

23:16.138 --> 23:16.618
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

23:38.513 --> 23:39.754
[SPEAKER_02]: Ultraviolate.

23:42.375 --> 23:45.277
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie can appreciate this one because she's a grammar Nazi there.

23:45.637 --> 23:46.758
[SPEAKER_02]: Ultraviolate.

23:46.818 --> 23:48.899
[SPEAKER_02]: The movie is supposed to be ultraviolet, right?

23:49.499 --> 23:50.900
[SPEAKER_02]: They put ultraviolate.

23:50.920 --> 23:54.242
[SPEAKER_00]: There should be a movie called Ultraviolate.

23:54.262 --> 23:55.142
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a porno.

23:55.522 --> 23:58.944
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry that I poked you in your live journal, by the way, speaking of grammar.

23:58.964 --> 23:59.525
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all right.

23:59.565 --> 24:00.585
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know what I did.

24:00.625 --> 24:03.026
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you used I as a subject.

24:03.867 --> 24:05.548
[SPEAKER_02]: I gave you a collective eye roll.

24:06.275 --> 24:09.196
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you used I as a subject.

24:09.436 --> 24:09.716
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, whatever.

24:09.736 --> 24:11.836
[SPEAKER_00]: When you said me and I. Did I really?

24:11.856 --> 24:12.817
[SPEAKER_00]: No, him and I. Oh.

24:12.857 --> 24:13.717
[SPEAKER_00]: You used it as a subject.

24:13.737 --> 24:14.517
[SPEAKER_00]: It should have been him and me.

24:14.537 --> 24:15.057
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh.

24:15.597 --> 24:16.057
[SPEAKER_02]: My bad.

24:16.838 --> 24:18.758
[SPEAKER_00]: Jamie's grammar lesson of the night.

24:18.798 --> 24:19.738
[SPEAKER_02]: Grammar tip of the week.

24:20.118 --> 24:23.819
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what you need on the podcast because you got rid of it.

24:23.839 --> 24:24.599
[SPEAKER_00]: Grammar tip of the week.

24:24.639 --> 24:24.860
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

24:24.920 --> 24:29.001
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got to get rid of the website and get your grammar tip of the week instead.

24:29.041 --> 24:29.861
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll have to think about that.

24:30.221 --> 24:30.561
[SPEAKER_00]: Rock.

24:30.621 --> 24:32.461
[SPEAKER_02]: If we do go on a little break here, maybe that can be something.

24:32.481 --> 24:34.982
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, an apostrophe does not make it plural.

24:36.431 --> 24:40.013
[SPEAKER_02]: That is very useful for kids that write on web forums and stuff.

24:40.593 --> 24:41.894
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to look into this.

24:42.234 --> 24:44.775
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we have something developing here.

24:44.795 --> 24:46.116
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

24:46.576 --> 24:47.457
[SPEAKER_02]: Or I could do it.

24:47.557 --> 24:50.498
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be ironic if I did it because I have the worst grammar in the world.

24:51.339 --> 24:52.219
[SPEAKER_00]: I've read your email.

24:53.360 --> 24:55.181
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but I write fast.

24:55.221 --> 24:56.161
[SPEAKER_05]: You write good.

24:57.482 --> 25:04.125
[SPEAKER_02]: I write good at work because I'll take time to spell check and grammar check and all that good stuff, but when I'm writing informally as I do in my live journal, I don't bother.

25:04.926 --> 25:05.426
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, whatever.

25:06.681 --> 25:14.788
[SPEAKER_02]: Alrighty, um, by the way, big thank you to, uh, Bugged, who, uh, I think was the one that pointed that out, um, and made, um, my buddy Jason take a picture of that, so.

25:16.329 --> 25:20.613
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, let's see, oh, yeah, somebody in chatroom says, Skyrite good.

25:23.295 --> 25:25.056
[SPEAKER_02]: I gotta tally up cage match votes here.

25:25.116 --> 25:27.098
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody's gotta talk about a completely different subject.

25:27.298 --> 25:30.301
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, do you have any, uh, podcast articles that didn't make the cut tonight?

25:31.122 --> 25:32.643
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, maybe?

25:33.023 --> 25:33.443
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

25:33.463 --> 25:33.924
[SPEAKER_01]: Um,

25:35.532 --> 25:35.692
[SPEAKER_01]: DJ Maxx

26:05.768 --> 26:07.409
[SPEAKER_01]: and Exit for the PSP.

26:09.070 --> 26:10.431
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Ground Day 3 is for the PS2.

26:12.193 --> 26:12.913
[SPEAKER_01]: What else was there?

26:13.594 --> 26:14.634
[SPEAKER_01]: There was some Yu-Gi-Oh!

26:14.654 --> 26:17.637
[SPEAKER_01]: 2 for 1 that was also coming out, but I don't play Yu-Gi-Oh!

26:17.657 --> 26:18.617
[SPEAKER_01]: so who cares?

26:19.238 --> 26:22.180
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, I don't know.

26:23.421 --> 26:33.648
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of good games coming out in March, including that really crappy game, Dance Factory, the one by Codemasters where you put any CD in and it'll make DDR steps for it.

26:33.788 --> 26:34.789
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm worried about this game.

26:35.703 --> 26:37.004
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it looks like crap.

26:38.184 --> 26:38.745
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure it is.

26:41.006 --> 26:44.288
[SPEAKER_01]: And... There's a new Monster Rancher game coming out.

26:44.568 --> 26:45.188
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yay!

26:45.649 --> 26:47.430
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, you know, we love those games.

26:47.550 --> 26:50.872
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, um... I don't know.

26:51.292 --> 26:51.792
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to think.

26:52.432 --> 26:53.753
[SPEAKER_01]: Really good games coming out.

26:53.833 --> 26:54.754
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to fill time anymore.

26:54.774 --> 26:55.254
[SPEAKER_01]: Bust the move.

26:55.594 --> 26:56.155
[SPEAKER_01]: Bust the move.

26:56.375 --> 26:56.795
[SPEAKER_01]: What?

26:56.855 --> 26:57.115
[SPEAKER_01]: What?

26:57.295 --> 26:57.836
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

26:58.056 --> 26:58.856
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, never mind.

26:58.956 --> 27:01.698
[SPEAKER_02]: You got me excited for a minute here because I thought we were talking Kitty Yen.

27:02.378 --> 27:02.978
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

27:03.259 --> 27:03.499
[SPEAKER_02]: Bummer.

27:06.508 --> 27:06.828
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

27:07.309 --> 27:15.897
[SPEAKER_01]: I did also last night, you know, we had those brochures that were pretty cool of that Tango game.

27:16.217 --> 27:17.138
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm-hmm.

27:17.927 --> 27:18.347
[SPEAKER_04]: Xtango?

27:18.527 --> 27:19.448
[SPEAKER_01]: Xtango, yeah.

27:19.808 --> 27:21.849
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, did that game ever freaking come out?

27:21.909 --> 27:22.089
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

27:22.509 --> 27:29.612
[SPEAKER_01]: But the brochures, they're made out of this, like, weird stuff that I tossed them in my fireplace, and they, like, burst into flames.

27:29.652 --> 27:34.673
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, they blew up, like, Jiffy Pop or something like that, and all of a sudden, boom!

27:34.693 --> 27:37.435
[SPEAKER_01]: There's, like, a huge fire coming out, like, woohoo!

27:40.556 --> 27:40.976
[SPEAKER_01]: Rad!

27:41.016 --> 27:43.537
[SPEAKER_01]: We were burning things last night and playing Scrabble, so that was...

27:44.447 --> 27:45.507
[SPEAKER_00]: Fire and Scrabble.

27:45.547 --> 27:47.468
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like the best way to spend an evening.

27:47.868 --> 27:48.408
[SPEAKER_02]: Then Clue.

27:48.568 --> 27:50.169
[SPEAKER_02]: You know how to fucking party, Loki.

27:50.409 --> 27:51.689
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way, I still have Rob's copy of Clue.

27:52.250 --> 27:55.731
[SPEAKER_02]: God damn it, give it back because Jason hasn't seen it and needs to.

27:56.571 --> 27:57.671
[SPEAKER_02]: So at least I think he told me.

27:57.691 --> 27:59.072
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to watch Advent Children.

27:59.392 --> 27:59.612
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

27:59.632 --> 28:00.672
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to watch Advent Children.

28:01.933 --> 28:08.815
[SPEAKER_02]: As a follow-up to something we talked about, Loki got me a DVD of Advent Children so I could... Speaking of Advent Children, remember I posted the new date on their website.

28:08.895 --> 28:11.136
[SPEAKER_01]: It's coming out April 25th in the U.S.,

28:13.120 --> 28:14.221
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

28:37.423 --> 28:43.765
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, for your next fire and scrabble night, Roz says, I heard that strawberry Pop-Tarts burst into flames.

28:44.545 --> 28:45.445
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't have Pop-Tarts.

28:45.485 --> 28:52.268
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't really burned, like, we just burn our junk mail and whatever paper we have in the house, usually.

28:52.668 --> 29:00.430
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been trying to push for burning the phone book, but for some reason, she doesn't want to burn the phone book.

29:01.890 --> 29:02.951
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at all that fire.

29:04.022 --> 29:05.363
[SPEAKER_01]: Pre-flammable stuff.

29:05.383 --> 29:06.924
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's like the size of a log as it is.

29:07.004 --> 29:08.324
[SPEAKER_02]: That stuff would go up in flames too.

29:08.384 --> 29:11.146
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's reveal tonight's podcast winner.

29:11.166 --> 29:12.567
[SPEAKER_02]: You know it was a... or podcast winner.

29:12.887 --> 29:13.868
[SPEAKER_02]: Cage match winner.

29:13.888 --> 29:15.128
[SPEAKER_02]: I have something else on my brain.

29:15.789 --> 29:16.549
[SPEAKER_02]: Tonight's cage match winner.

29:17.069 --> 29:27.415
[SPEAKER_02]: Very interesting cage match winner situation tonight because we had two songs tied, but one song got one more vote than those two songs.

29:27.735 --> 29:30.237
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was an incredibly close match tonight.

29:30.597 --> 29:32.178
[SPEAKER_02]: So all songs did very well.

29:32.571 --> 29:33.732
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

29:55.123 --> 30:00.326
[SPEAKER_02]: Just goes to show that it doesn't matter what we think, ultimately the chatroom can do whatever the fuck they want.

30:00.366 --> 30:01.426
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they're just fucking with us.

30:01.666 --> 30:03.787
[SPEAKER_02]: That was our punishment for you doing that, Loki.

30:03.887 --> 30:04.588
[SPEAKER_02]: Good job.

30:04.888 --> 30:06.008
[SPEAKER_02]: Way to ruin it, Loki.

30:06.849 --> 30:07.589
[SPEAKER_01]: Dick.

30:07.609 --> 30:12.172
[SPEAKER_02]: And since Jamie and I won't be here next week, that song by default wins two weeks in a row.

30:12.532 --> 30:13.292
[SPEAKER_02]: Good job.

30:14.072 --> 30:16.814
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, way you lose at the internet.

30:16.834 --> 30:17.214
[SPEAKER_00]: Kill him.

30:18.054 --> 30:18.975
[SPEAKER_02]: This show is over.

30:19.035 --> 30:20.436
[SPEAKER_00]: This show is over.

30:21.436 --> 30:21.896
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kidding.

30:22.257 --> 30:22.917
[SPEAKER_02]: Final thoughts.

30:25.045 --> 30:26.766
[SPEAKER_01]: The extra final thoughts, Loki.

30:28.006 --> 30:36.609
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to freaking get out of this goddamn writer's block for my music stuff, because I need to make a song by the March deadline.

30:37.729 --> 30:38.650
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, your final thoughts.

30:39.150 --> 30:39.770
[SPEAKER_00]: I like mummies.

30:41.590 --> 30:43.271
[SPEAKER_00]: I plugged in mummified cats, remember?

30:44.491 --> 30:50.813
[SPEAKER_00]: Mummified cats are cool, because when they have their wrappings, they actually stitch little ears onto their wrappings.

30:51.194 --> 30:51.694
[SPEAKER_00]: It was cute.

30:52.134 --> 30:52.454
[SPEAKER_02]: Dorky.

30:53.307 --> 30:57.631
[SPEAKER_02]: My final thought is bye, and I'll see you on March 5th.

30:57.731 --> 30:57.911
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.

30:57.951 --> 30:59.312
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to miss you guys.

30:59.332 --> 31:00.993
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to miss you.

31:01.053 --> 31:02.934
[SPEAKER_02]: I miss you already, Rob, but my aim's improving.

31:02.974 --> 31:03.275
[SPEAKER_02]: Shut up.

31:03.615 --> 31:05.256
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll see some of our listeners at Katsukon, though.

31:05.336 --> 31:06.077
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to be exciting.

31:06.397 --> 31:09.960
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have to make flyers for Katsukon because I said I would at some point, so we'll do that.

31:10.280 --> 31:11.120
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, that's it.

31:11.220 --> 31:13.042
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's your fortune cookie message for the day.

31:16.193 --> 31:17.854
[SPEAKER_04]: You're tuned into Orange Lounge Radio.

31:17.874 --> 31:21.617
[SPEAKER_04]: Radio dedicated to video games and what gamers really want to know.
