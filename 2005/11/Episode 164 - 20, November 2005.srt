1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,500
Lost a dream or two, found a trail

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:08,500
And at the end was you

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,500
There's a path you take and it might not take

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:14,500
The choice is up to you my friend

5
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,500
A night so long but you might awake

6
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,500
To a brand new life, a brand new life

7
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:24,500
A brand new life goes round to me

8
00:00:50,500 --> 00:01:00,500
Hello everybody.

9
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:08,080
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio tonight on episode number 164.

10
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,700
We got a lot of stuff planned including songs from Ultramix 3.

11
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:16,740
We're going to be talking a whole lot about the Ultramix 3 tonight plus Orange Lounge

12
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:19,140
Radio goes to the movies again to look at ourselves.

13
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,940
Uh, well, at least Loki and Dark Sakura, because we haven't done that yet, because we weren't here last week!

14
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:27,140
So we're back from our vacation, and we're ready to kick some butt!

15
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:29,140
We'll be back after this.

16
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:04,140
that.

17
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:31,140
Orange, man, you're itty on the line.

18
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:34,140
This mommy talks radio.

19
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:37,140
Oh my god.

20
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:40,140
Oh god.

21
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:43,140
Heh heh heh heh. Call me daddy.

22
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:48,140
Orange Lounge may contain adult content.

23
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:53,140
Orange Lounge may contain many four-letter words.

24
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:56,140
Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity.

25
00:02:56,140 --> 00:03:00,040
The Orange Lounge takes a plenty of...

26
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,640
...muh...muh...cawkey.

27
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,640
Just kidding, Orange Lounge Radio will not contain any of that in this episode.

28
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,640
Why isn't that special?

29
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:24,640
Orange Lounge Radio Live is a fully interactive program via our website at www.orangelaungeradio.com.

30
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:32,640
And now, here are your hosts for Orange Lounge Radio Live, Dark Sakura, Skye and Loki.

31
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:45,640
We are live! And this is episode number 164 for this November the 20th of 2005.

32
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:51,640
Hey guys! It's 20 November! Get it? Get it? Get it?

33
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:58,160
Your home for all the news and discussion on rhythm and music games as well as the gamer

34
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,560
community and the pop culture world.

35
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:06,920
We're plugged in and fully interactive through our website at www.orangeloungeradio.com.

36
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:09,000
My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky.

37
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,280
Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts in this corner, the happiest bunny on the

38
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,280
farm, DarkSakura.

39
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,320
Wait a minute, actually, just kidding.

40
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:21,320
She is actually, actually she might be, hold on.

41
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:24,440
Let's try this again, in this corner, DarkSakura.

42
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,520
Can she hear me?

43
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,340
Hello?

44
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:32,760
We're trying to bring DarkSakura in on Skype tonight.

45
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,600
Are you there?

46
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,280
I thought we had her for a minute.

47
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,800
Whoa, she's really, really broken up.

48
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,780
I don't know what's going on there.

49
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,840
That's a little weird.

50
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,680
This is gonna be one of those nights, kids.

51
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,840
We'll try to get DarkSakura back on the line in a little bit

52
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,800
but she is gonna be joining us.

53
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,800
Unfortunately, she is very, very ill right now.

54
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,640
I don't know what happened.

55
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,300
She caught something at the podcast for it.

56
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,800
Adam Curry gave her something, apparently.

57
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,600
No, actually, I don't want to make light of it.

58
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,440
She's very sick.

59
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:03,900
And she'll try to be calling in over the Skype line tonight

60
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,520
because she misses you guys and wants to say hello.

61
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,860
But she is in our chat room at orange-rated.com.

62
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:08,880
Click on chat.

63
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,260
Meanwhile, here in studio,

64
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:12,660
we have the one and only Tech Master, Loki.

65
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:13,500
Hello.

66
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,960
Howdy.

67
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,420
Hi.

68
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:19,860
And we also have with us, uh, say hello to DDR Angel.

69
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:20,580
Hello.

70
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:21,420
Hi.

71
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,340
It's working, how you doing?

72
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:22,840
Yay!

73
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,340
Alright.

74
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,020
Good.

75
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:24,980
Good!

76
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:28,540
And over there, we have Xtopher.

77
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:29,780
Well, hello there!

78
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:30,280
Hello!

79
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,300
What's this doing there, Ron?

80
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,100
Hello!

81
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,220
Well, hello!

82
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:37,060
Alright.

83
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,300
Alright, anyway.

84
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,180
Oh, also, Bugs! Bugs is here!

85
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,380
Playing the sick person, is that right?

86
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:43,900
How are you doing? Actually, uh, DarkStalker wins that.

87
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,580
She has, like, pneumonia.

88
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:49,100
yeah it's crazy so but i don't remember what it feels like i've been sick for

89
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,580
two years so yeah i've been sick for two years yeah

90
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:54,620
that's a lot of echinacea no i had a throat surgery two years ago that

91
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:57,980
removed basically everything out of the throat

92
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:02,300

93
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:05,500
anyway kids what we're going to do um since it is a

94
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:10,140
very special day here uh in the balani world we're going to start off tonight

95
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:12,460
by taking a real quick break to bring you

96
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:14,380
song and

97
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:17,300
We'll come back and we're gonna get into some music from Ultramix 3 as well

98
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:22,340
But of course because it is 20 November, you know, we have to start off tonight with this song. So here it is

99
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:29,340
is 20 November and we'll be back right after this.

100
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:59,340
Come on, shake it love, you can, don't be angry all night long, let's get heavy, calm down, now how can you feel, I just wanna hear you speak, all night long.

101
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:27,340
All I know is you never let me down

102
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:32,340
Down, down

103
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:37,340
That gave it to me good

104
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:46,260
All right, we're back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

105
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:47,700
We're going to get into some music, though.

106
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:51,220
Now, see, that was just a special thing, because it is 20 November, we have to, and we will

107
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:55,260
give a happy belated 19 November later in the show, but since it is kind of the Bemani

108
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,940
holiday, I have no idea why.

109
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,460
Well, I do know why.

110
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:02,700
It's this big, stupid thing that everybody, you know, recognizes in the scene, so whatever.

111
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:03,700
There you go.

112
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:08,040
Okay, so we're gonna get into some music though from Ultramix 3 and I'll tell you what first thing

113
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:14,160
I'm gonna say about Ultramix 3 before we even really get into the show. It's got a very interesting song list a very

114
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:24,180
Special song list if you will it's it's definitely diverse. We'll give it that so we're gonna be playing like special school bus

115
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:27,240
Yeah, the helmet special. It's all kinds of special

116
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:32,080
So we will be playing music from Ultramix 3 throughout tonight's show for you guys and you be the judge

117
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,400
We're going to play the good stuff and the bad stuff and the downright ugly stuff.

118
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:39,400
We're going to play it all tonight, and the stuff that you guys like we'll keep in rotation

119
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:42,840
on our Bomani Music Award, but the stuff that's just like, what the fuck?

120
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,920
We will get rid of and never play again.

121
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:51,180
All right, so in this break we're going to start off, we're going to play in this break

122
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:53,440
a track by Orifiz with Basile.

123
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,040
They were in the last UltraMix game, so this should be interesting.

124
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,080
We're going to play a song called Come With Me.

125
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,160
It's not the same one from the V-Rare, though.

126
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:04,920
by Yehill and Tammy, so it's the other Come With Me we're gonna play in this

127
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:08,760
break, and then we're gonna play Black Eyed Peas. Black Eyed Peas have a

128
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:12,800
brand new song in this Ultra Mix, so check this out. Actually it's not really

129
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,120
a brand new, it's actually an old-ass Black Eyed Peas song, but it's new for us

130
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:19,680
in DDR, and for somebody who doesn't really listen to pop radio like me, it

131
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,480
was a brand new song. Thank God it's not my humps.

132
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:27,600
All right, we're gonna check out these songs. We'll be right back with more

133
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,600
More Orange Lounge Radio after this.

134
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,600
Let's go, get your mind on it!

135
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,600
Shall we dance?

136
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,600
Let's go, get your mind on it!

137
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:29,600
I can make him nothing

138
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:36,600
I can make him nothing

139
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:43,600
Shall we dance?

140
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:53,600
Shall we dance?

141
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,600
Shall we dance?

142
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:59,600
I'd spend on nothing I'd like to do

143
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:50,320
I see you passing all the time, I like your face, I like your style, the way you move,

144
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:56,320
I think it's cool, go take my hand And let's just move

145
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:04,320
Come with me, come with me To the place we can run free

146
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:11,320
Come with me, come with me To the place we can run free

147
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:26,320
Come with me, come with me Come with me to the place we can be free

148
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:23,280
I got a 1990 style and a 1990 crew For everything I do, I do just for you

149
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:28,280
I'm a little bit to old and a bigger bit to new Never cease, we never die, no, we never

150
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:31,080
decease We multiply like we mathematicians

151
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:37,880
The kongbama, the bass drum drummers Who we are, we the stars

152
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:44,080
Steady rockin' all of y'all's boulevards And lookin' hard without bodyguards

153
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:49,880
What I can, still I am And still I stand with steel mic in hand

154
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,880
So come on mamma, then see the drummer

155
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:52,380
Hey mama

156
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:54,880
Get a blast master, Dr. Jammer

157
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,380
Hey so shake ya bum, mama

158
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:57,380

Get a blast master, Dr. Jammer

160
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:02,880
But the race is not for the rich

161
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:05,380
But for who can heat over it

162
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:09,380
And give Hari and the block, I please will be there

163
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:16,380

00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:55,900
We have Mel B over here, with no microphone, low-key, let's get on that, sharing the mic

171
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:56,900
thing.

172
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:57,900
Mel, how you doing?

173
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:01,460
Doing great, it's 20 November, and hey, what's a party without Melvis in the house?

174
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:02,460
Oh, that's right.

175
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:04,580
Now, how have things been with you?

176
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:10,100
Things have been pretty super, I mean, just personally things, pretty hectic, just with

177
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:13,740
the whole work stuff going on, kind of promoted at work.

178
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:16,180
Now just so people know, you don't work at Konami anymore?

179
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:17,180
Nah, nah.

180
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:20,860
So if I razz on some things about UltraMix 3 tonight, you're not to blame for any of

181
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:21,860
that?

182
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:25,140
I will laugh along with you, likely.

183
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:29,340
Alright, what's this Konami shirt you're sporting tonight now?

184
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:34,020
Oh, it's a black t-shirt for those of you out there listening, it's a black t-shirt

185
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:39,060
that has the old Konami standard font logo on the back, it says Bimani, it actually has

186
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:43,620
the URL, I think it's like konami-arcade.com.

187
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:46,940
That's old school, because now they've got that music in every direction thing, that's

188
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:48,800
an old, konami.com-arcade.

189
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:53,680
You know what I hear, and I'm okay to say this I think, because the website's up and

190
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:58,300
it's public, I don't know if you guys have seen this, konamistyle.net, they're launching

191
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:02,180
some US version of Konami style.

192
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:05,140
I've heard intimations about it, I can't say much about it.

193
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:09,700
I don't know how much I might have said too much, but it's out there publicly anybody can find it

194
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:16,800
So it's it's there. It's gonna launch soon. So yeah, I've heard you know, I've talked to people within the company about it

195
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,460
But you know, I don't think that anyone else couldn't speculate on me on the down low

196
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:25,800
I know I got what I got noses out there on there in every direction finding this stuff out. It's all good

197
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:31,180
Yeah, the cool thing actually just back on t-shirt real quick. This is actually the first prize ever won in a DDR tournament

198
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:36,820
It was the item to freestyle back in SoCal, I think it was 2000 Santa Monica Pier Tourney,

199
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:40,880
and there were only like three t-shirts given out, and I think overall, of people I know

200
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,500
in the community, there are only like five.

201
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,500
Wow.

202
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,500
Awesome.

203
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,740
Yeah, I'm one of the special Fab Five.

204
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:52,580
Now, I have to ask you really quickly before we get into the other stuff in the show, did

205
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:54,580
you listen to this week's podcast that we do?

206
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,900
Yes, as a matter of fact, I did.

207
00:16:56,900 --> 00:17:01,740
What did you think about, now we, somebody, one of our listeners wrote us an email about,

208
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:06,340
wanting to know about Dan's, Dan's documentary, which we later found out, you can't get a

209
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:09,940
copy of it, it's not out on DVD, it was just screened at a couple film festivals, that

210
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:11,740
poor guy's out of luck.

211
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:14,740
But one thing that we mentioned on there is that you can actually see the movie on internet

212
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:20,300
movie database and, ba-doom, you got your own internet movie database page.

213
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:25,340
I had no idea, I mean, people talk about being, you know, some sort of internet celebrity

214
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:30,080
whatever but being on IMDB that's a whole different sort of freaky

215
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:34,080
and they still can't even spell my last name wrong. Is your last name spelled wrong on there?

216
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:38,240
Yes I do not have an H in my last name. I don't know why people assume there is

217
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,320
but

218
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,200
uh...

219
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:43,360
Anyway I wrote to them and you know hopefully they'll fix it. Alright we'll see.

220
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:48,640
Alright awesome. And of course Sharks Girl Melody is here tonight. How you doing?

221
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,940
Uh... I'm alive. Are you happy that your sharks are playing again?

222
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:55,300
Kind of. I'd like them to be winning a little more.

223
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:58,340
But at least it's going on. They're here, that's the big point.

224
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:01,860
Now tell us about this fundraiser you're a part of.

225
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:05,780
I know this is a big part of your life lately and I'm just curious.

226
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:09,260
Yeah, I decided in...

227
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:12,380
Well, I decided in May actually that I was going to look into joining the

228
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:16,700
team in training through the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society to walk a marathon.

229
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:21,180
And at that point in time, I was literally waiting for E3, the day of the

230
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:25,500
meeting and things weren't working out time wise, so I thought, okay, I'll join the fall

231
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,500
season.

232
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:32,740
So I went back in July and did, started training on July 31st and I've been training for a

233
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:33,740
marathon.

234
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:37,940
I'm going to be walking 26.2 miles, hopefully, on December 11th in Honolulu.

235
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:38,940
Awesome.

236
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:45,700
And I'm up to, I've raised $3,675 so far for leukemia and lymphoma in the research.

237
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:46,700
Wow, that's amazing.

238
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:47,700
Yeah.

239
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:52,060
want to donate more because you can go above and beyond, right? Do we have a link we can

240
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:53,060
give or something?

241
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:55,460
Yes. I'm actually over my total, but I'm taking everything anyone's willing to give

242
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:56,460
me.

243
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:57,460
Absolutely, absolutely.

244
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:00,060
Even if it's just a dollar or two, the best thing to do is go to livejournal.com slash

245
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:05,220
user slash melathon, M-E-L-A-T-O-N. How do you spell it? It's like marathon only with

246
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,220
mel.

247
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:07,220
Melathon.

248
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:09,220
I can't even think of how to spell it myself. That's kind of sad.

249
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:10,220
M-E-L-A-T-H-O-N.

250
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:11,220
Thank you.

251
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,220
You're welcome.

252
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:16,140
Yeah, that's pretty much been my life lately.

253
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:18,520
I was supposed to walk 22 miles yesterday.

254
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:25,380
I did 12 because on Tuesday I fell and ran my knee into a curb, and it's very lovely

255
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,380
and pretty multicolors.

256
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:27,380
Ouch.

257
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:32,700
Yeah, it's kind of put a damper in a thing since I'm three weeks out from the marathon.

258
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,500
Yeah, that's ouch.

259
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:38,100
I've got a backup plan in place, and my coach is not that worried.

260
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:41,800
Now, did you use DDR for any of your stamina training?

261
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,700
the background that I already had because they actually yelled at me not to do anything

262
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:45,700
else.

263
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:46,700
Really?

264
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:50,760
For fear of hurting myself, which instead I go and I walk and run into a curb.

265
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,760
You know I had to ask.

266
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,760
Yeah, you won't.

267
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:57,080
Actually, I haven't turned on my DDR machine in two or three months.

268
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:00,680
Theoretically this shows about, you know, DDR and music games and stuff, so I have to

269
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:05,360
bring it up once in a while, just to interject the idea of the illusion that we actually

270
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,080
play DDR once in a while still.

271
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,080
There you go.

272
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,800
But yeah, so that's been most of my life every Saturday.

273
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:14,120
The most I've walked at one time is 15 miles straight,

274
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:17,720
and that took about five hours, I think.

275
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,080
Wow.

276
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,200
I mean, heck, walking in Honolulu,

277
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,920
that wouldn't be a problem for me.

278
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,280
I could walk all day in Hawaii.

279
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,520
And see, one of my things was, hey,

280
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:29,360
there's a nice little store in Hawaii in Honolulu

281
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,800
that sells lots of import games.

282
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,920
I think I could go there.

283
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,080
There you go.

284
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,360
Is it on the marathon route?

285
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,120
Wouldn't mind if you took a little detour.

286
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:41,800
extra time so I need time to go shop and then say hey I want that and go back

287
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:46,680
all right all right um what we're gonna do now um we're gonna try now we tried

288
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:50,100
to get dark Sakura on the show in the beginning but unfortunately our Skype

289
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:56,200
was going a little bit crazy so I'm going to try and get dark Sakura back on

290
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:06,420
a line here so let's see if we have any luck here I gotta bring up Skype that's

291
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:10,500
weird it's almost sounds like it's calling her actual phone phone let's see

292
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:25,720
doo doo doo doo doo doo one ringy dingy dingy hello hello that was weird it

293
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:28,040
It sounded all phantom-y when she came on.

294
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,040
Hello?

295
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,040
All broken up.

296
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,040
That's weird.

297
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,640
Do we have any other stuff going?

298
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,120
Let me lower our bandwidth here.

299
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,120
Live radio, everybody.

300
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,360
This stuff happens once in a while.

301
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:41,440
I'm just trying to kill any excess bandwidth we have.

302
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,440
Can you hear us, Jamie?

303
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,440
Yeah.

304
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,160
Can you hear me?

305
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,160
There.

306
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,160
Okay.

307
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,160
We've got her a little bit there.

308
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,540
We just got a really bad delay there, but that's all right.

309
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:52,600
We can deal with that.

310
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,040
DarkSakura, what's going on?

311
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,100
How are you doing?

312
00:21:55,100 --> 00:22:06,320
kind of sick I know but they thought it was yeah hello hi I'm what's what's

313
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:13,820
going on Dark Sakura what's what just closed IRC okay they thought I had mm-hmm

314
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:20,820
and it turns out to be really bad case of bronchitis oh no so I'm really sick

315
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:26,580
oh gosh well I'm really sorry to see you not here tonight I was gonna I was gonna

316
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:30,340
have you start us off with how was your week how was your day but I imagine I

317
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:39,020
imagine it's not so great. I spent most of the week sick and I started getting better I went

318
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:45,460
to the doctor on Monday and I started getting better around Wednesday

319
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:51,820
Thursday and then I had a bad relapse on Friday and my boss basically sent me to

320
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:58,080
the doctor right away and he x-rayed and I have some fluid in my lungs but not

321
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:02,920
enough to qualify as full-blown pneumonia so they're treating me for

322
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:08,160
severe bronchitis. Still either way bronchitis or pneumonia no fun at all I

323
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:13,360
imagine so. I didn't play any games this week but I did watch a lot of the Muppet

324
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,360
show

325
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:17,480
well that's cool do you have a favorite episode of the Muppet Show?

326
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,680
uh... i like the one with Twiggy

327
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:23,200
and the one with Sandy Duncan

328
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:30,200
that's awesome i think i think we might actually have a little mood music here

329
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,920
see this is Jamie's week in a nutshell unfortunately is the Muppet Show here

330
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:45,920
And not doing my homework until the weekend.

331
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,920
Don't you get a buy from your homework though when you're sick?

332
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:51,920
No, unfortunately.

333
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:54,920
Some of my classes are online, so I don't necessarily...

334
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:58,920
Your professors are evil for not letting you have a buy on your homework.

335
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:03,920
One of my teachers is giving us a week off for Thanksgiving in one of my online classes.

336
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:07,920
Now, what are your plans for Thanksgiving? Is this going to get in the way of Thanksgiving?

337
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:15,500
I have no idea, but I'm tired of being stuck in the house, because I had to miss going to see Chemical Angel on Saturday.

338
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:16,000
Uh-huh.

339
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:24,120
And missing the show tonight, and I missed seeing my friend, um, one of my co-workers who moved to Delaware was in town today.

340
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:24,620
Mm-hmm.

341
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,640
And I missed my chance to see her.

342
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,140
Mm-hmm.

343
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,240
And we did talk on the phone for a little bit.

344
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,040
Well, that's something, okay.

345
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:35,680
But, it's just been, bleh.

346
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,180
Well, what-

347
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:38,580
I slept 13 hours yesterday.

348
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:41,660
You know, I've slept a lot.

349
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:43,820
I slept like 11 hours last night,

350
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:45,460
and I don't have a good excuse for that.

351
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:46,860
I really don't.

352
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:49,940
I was sick like two weeks ago, but it was just a common cold.

353
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:51,180
It was nothing major.

354
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:52,860
But I don't really have a good excuse.

355
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,620
I had a cold.

356
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:56,980
This is what my cold turned into.

357
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:58,540
That's sucky.

358
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:01,660
When did the doctors think it would be better?

359
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:04,180
Nobody put me on.

360
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:08,140
I was on Keflux, which is kind of a mild antibiotic.

361
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:09,860
That was for the sinus infection.

362
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:11,980
And then once he found out just how bad it was,

363
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:16,300
he put me on doxycycline, which is, from what I understand,

364
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:18,140
supposed to be pretty hardcore stuff.

365
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:19,540
Wow.

366
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:22,540
Yeah, so he gave me a seven-day supply,

367
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:24,340
but I'm going to see how I feel.

368
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:25,540
It's helping some.

369
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:26,740
I'm getting a little better.

370
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:27,260
That's good.

371
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:29,300
Well, I hope you get back to work tomorrow.

372
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,020
Oh, gosh.

373
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:31,980
I hope you get a lot better by Thursday.

374
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:33,300
At least it's a short work week.

375
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:35,740
I mean, there's something to look forward to there, a little bit.

376
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:36,740
Yeah.

377
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:37,740
I guess.

378
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:39,220
What else was I going to ask?

379
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:42,220
Oh, before, you know, we're going to go around the room and see how everybody else's weekend

380
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:44,580
day was, but I wanted to ask, what were your thoughts, I know you haven't had a chance

381
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:47,980
to play games, you haven't had a chance to check out Ultramix 3 yet, what do you think

382
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:51,100
of the music so far, though?

383
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:56,000
I wouldn't be the one to ask, I've been paying attention, I've been either passed out or

384
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
doing homework.

385
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
That's alright, it's understandable.

386
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,460
Okay, well, Jamie, what we're going to do, we're going to go back around the room, we'll

387
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:04,460
We'll bring you back later in the show, though, for some of our other stuff, okay?

388
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:05,460
Okay.

389
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:06,460
All right, take care.

390
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:07,460
Rest up.

391
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:08,460
All right.

392
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:09,460
All right.

393
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:10,460
Any final words for the listeners for right now?

394
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:12,460
Send me money.

395
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:13,460
Okay.

396
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:14,460
We will do.

397
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:15,460
Okay.

398
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:16,460
All right.

399
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:17,460
Bye.

400
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:18,460
Bye.

401
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:19,460
Bye.

402
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:20,460
Bye.

403
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:21,460
All right.

404
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:22,460
We'll bring her back on the show a little later.

405
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:25,900
She feels bad because she wasn't here last week and she's been out, but obviously she's

406
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:29,460
got to rest up, so we hope she gets better very soon.

407
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:33,460
Well, let's go around the room and see how other folks are having their day and their week.

408
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:38,460
We'll start with Angel, because she's over there just lounging around there with the microphone ready to go.

409
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:41,460
What's up? How was your day?

410
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:47,460
Good. I did something I said I wasn't going to do, and you're going to laugh now.

411
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:48,460
What's that?

412
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:51,460
I rolled Alliance.

413
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:54,460
Wait. Oh, you joined an alliance on World of Warcraft?

414
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:58,460
I rolled Alliance. Yeah, I rolled Alliance character on a different server.

415
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:10,460
server. Oh, okay. What server? Uh, Malfurion. Okay. Um, it's me. Okay. Okay. He's never

416
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:17,460
gonna laugh. Oh, yeah. Well, anyway. I told everyone I wasn't gonna do it. Careful, that

417
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:21,060
microphone's the weird one. You gotta make sure you're, yeah, it's weird. It doesn't

418
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:27,780
like me there you go there you go yay yay for wiring okay so um yeah so I

419
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:32,700
said I wasn't gonna do it and then I did so I don't know everything's weird now

420
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:37,140
because I'm so used to like playing chord and stuff so you're having to play

421
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:45,180
as the bad guy well actually yeah what else you've been playing this week not

422
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:52,980
World of Warcraft but oh yeah guitar hero because I just got that tool yeah

423
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:57,860
how's guitar hero working out for you uh sometimes the notes go too fast but if I

424
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:03,420
concentrate on what what's going where everything's cool so what else do we get

425
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:08,220
this week what do you think about guitar hero compared to guitar freaks um I

426
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:12,900
haven't I didn't get to play guitar freaks that much because you know when I

427
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:17,340
first started coming up here and stuff with you guys. The machines were always broken,

428
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:23,980
so don't! So, like, whenever you, you know, you guys played it for me or whatever, it

429
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:30,980
was really neat to watch. But this one's got its kicks and fun stuff too. We also have

430
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:37,260
Path of Neo in the house. So I've been watching Andrew play that, and all is good. But I still

431
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:41,260
like my World of Warcraft. Have you been on Mario Kart Frenzy this week? Yes. Yeah? Yes,

432
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:49,880
I got to play with Slinky, and Big Run Pimp, and DJ Runway S, and you know, all of my buddies.

433
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:50,880
It's fun.

434
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:51,880
The online thing is crazy, isn't it?

435
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:52,880
Yes, it is.

436
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:53,880
And there's no lag.

437
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:54,880
At least I don't think.

438
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:55,880
Is there lag?

439
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:56,880
No, not really.

440
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:57,880
I don't notice it.

441
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:58,880
Yeah.

442
00:28:58,880 --> 00:28:59,880
I think it's great.

443
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:04,120
So, I've been doing a lot of gaming this week, when I should be concentrating on school,

444
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,000
which I'm doing too.

445
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,160
But gaming's much more fun.

446
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,160
Especially this week.

447
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:12,860
such a big week with all the releases that came out last week. All the games. Going into

448
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:18,720
next week and the 360 and all that crap. I don't even have a PSP yet. Oh well. Soon.

449
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:27,480
Anything else? No. Alright. I don't think so. I feel like a bat. It's so comfortable

450
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:31,300
when you're lying there to just be able to go to sleep, so. Be careful. Stay awake and

451
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:33,480
alert, because you'll never know when there might be a fire in the house or something.

452
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,880
You won't want to sleep through that. I'll be like, Angel, wake up! Hitting me with a

453
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:40,880
Alright, Mel, I see you got a microphone. How was your week? How was your day?

454
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:47,880
Um, week's been pretty nuts with work. Like, I've been totally, been sent on totally different assignments.

455
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:55,880
Now normally, like, I do editing and stuff for tests. Now I've actually been assigned to help create tests for visually impaired people.

456
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:59,880
So, like, things I have to learn is I actually have to learn, like, some basic Braille.

457
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:02,880
Huh. Or you have to learn to write really big.

458
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:09,320
Yeah, actually instead of that what we do is like I write audio scripts for stuff like say for a math problem

459
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:13,080
There's like a drawing of a triangle which is like, you know, four or five, you know

460
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:18,560
Whatever the Pythagorean triple is but the thing is of course obviously a blind person can't see that and you know

461
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:21,560
You can't really make like a raised diagram for them to feel around

462
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:25,560
So you actually have to write the description like there is a triangle ABC

463
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:31,960
You know B is a right angle and you know side AB equals four and BC equals five, you know by that large hard

464
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:35,020
It's so hard to do and he can't see.

465
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:38,440
It's really like a kind of a crash course in articulation and like basically you're

466
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:41,480
kind of thinking, well if someone was from another planet, how would you describe all

467
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,480
this stuff to them?

468
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,480
So it's...

469
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:46,280
How would you describe DDR to somebody who is visually impaired?

470
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,280
Let's see.

471
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,280
A lost cause.

472
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,280
Let's see.

473
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,280
Let's see.

474
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,280
Okay.

475
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:54,940
There is loud Japanese Eurobeat music playing.

476
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:59,060
There are arrows slowly crawling up the screen.

477
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:03,740
But if you're visually impaired, how do you know what an arrow is?

478
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:04,740
Easy, Paul!

479
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:05,740
The break!

480
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:14,100
There is somebody dancing on a pad with arrows and the pad lights up when they step on it.

481
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:20,180
This person looks really gay playing this game.

482
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:21,180
Shut up, Rob!

483
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:27,740
This person is holding on to a bar that is pink in color with a black top that has since

484
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:39,020
been ripped off by little six-year-old shits at Golf Land. Anyway, sorry about that. What

485
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:40,020
else is going on in your world?

486
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:46,500
Oh, let's see. All that boring stuff aside. What else? I guess as far as gaming, I've

487
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:51,860
been playing, got a couple of new games that I've been into this week. Let's see, Smackdown

488
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:58,580
versus raw 2006 for PS2. Doesn't this have a Barbie mode in it where you can make your

489
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:03,660
own wrestlers? Oh actually the create a wrestler mode has been around since like I think a

490
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:09,020
couple versions ago but this time they've gotten even more detailed with things like

491
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:13,380
you know this time you can customize your entrance like you know different types of

492
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:17,060
you can have like fireworks go off you know at certain points or you can like have the

493
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:20,900
camera pan around to someone else or, you know, all sorts of...

494
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:21,900
That's great.

495
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:24,500
You can do the techno, you know, lighting, all sorts of things.

496
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:28,940
The game makes you spend like an hour coming up with a perfect introduction and like no

497
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:29,940
time on the actual...

498
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:33,220
I'll put it like this, when I was making my first character it took me about three and

499
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:34,220
a half hours.

500
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:35,220
Oh my god.

501
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:39,180
You know, that's, but that's because not only are you making the character but because it's

502
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:43,100
a new game you want to see what new types of hairstyles or like clothes you can put

503
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,100
on people.

504
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:47,700
It's just exploration really, but it's still pretty damn fun.

505
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:52,240
That's kind of like Soul Calibur 3 has a make a fighter mode. It's pretty

506
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:55,680
pretty intensive too. But you don't get to do your intro, which is too

507
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:59,320
bad because Soul Calibur 3 practically has wrestling intros where it's like

508
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:04,320
the soul will burn as two entrants come for the next battle.

509
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:09,040
I shall destroy you with every inch of my being!

510
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:15,040
Do we have to fight now? Let there be a great battle!

511
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:20,040
I swear to god, like SoulCalibur goes on and on with like the setups of these fights.

512
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:27,040
Uh, Rob, you would do a good intro for the next World of Warcraft game?

513
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,040
I should be SoulCalibur 4, it's all about me.

514
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:35,040
I am the Pencils Pope, you killed my father, prefer to die!

515
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:40,040
Alright. Anyway, sorry, I keep cutting you off, buddy.

516
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,040
It's cool.

517
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:47,040
But yeah, let's see, Smackdown vs. WoW is a pretty fun game. I mean, the grappling engine has been...

518
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:52,040
It's a little deeper now, so there's like, kind of, you know, not only are you grabbing them, it's like, do you grab them now?

519
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:57,040
Do you want to, like, throw them, you know, outside the ring, or do you want to just, you know, give them a love tap?

520
00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:01,040
There's like six million different ways to go. It's like a choose your own adventure book with grappling now.

521
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:07,040
But it's still pretty cool. I think the most fun though is just creating the characters and like, you know, making mockeries of all your friends.

522
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:09,040
You know, that's the fun of it.

523
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:12,040
Making characters that look like your friends and then kicking the shit out of them.

524
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:16,040
That's what we do essentially, everybody in like RTF and Step Squad.

525
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:18,040
Yeah, we just have like these big get-togethers.

526
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:23,040
I make my characters in Soul Calibur 3 look really, really faggy, like the best I get.

527
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:27,040
Like I gave one a po-pat and a clown necklace and no pants.

528
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:34,040
No pants. And he's wearing like a little jock strap or something where I swear you could see his ass.

529
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:38,040
And it's purple. For no real reason.

530
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:40,040
I gotta see those characters.

531
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:43,040
That's great. I love creating a character in Soul Calibur 3.

532
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:49,040
Let's see, what else? Guitar Hero obviously has been also getting a lot of play time. That's pretty fun.

533
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:54,040
Yeah, those are pretty much the two main games I've been playing this week.

534
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:58,040
And, yeah, everything's been a pretty good all together and today, hey, I'm here, you

535
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,040
know?

536
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,040
It's 20 November, ahh.

537
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,040
Alright.

538
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:04,760
Sharks Girl, how was your week, how was your day?

539
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:08,680
My week has been the same as every week for the last, I don't know how many, I walked

540
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:09,680
a lot.

541
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:14,040
God, I've probably done over 250 miles at this point.

542
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,040
Can't you help me, though?

543
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,040
Oh, yeah, I have an awful lot of weight.

544
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,040
I should be training for a marathon.

545
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,040
Oh, it's great.

546
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:24,020
But, yeah, I worked, I walked, I actually went to a store called Sur La Table, I don't

547
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:26,920
know if anyone else... I don't know if it's a Bay Area thing or if it's

548
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:29,760
nationwide or what but it's one of those places where it's like a cooking

549
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:34,720
utensil store but they also have like a kitchen and stuff and my work hired it

550
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,520
out and brought a bunch of people we work with in there were like 40 people

551
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:41,960
there and we all drank wine and made food and it was really entertaining so

552
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:46,160
and I now have a really good recipe for petite beef wellingtons if anyone wants

553
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:52,000
it but yes I did that I walked aforementioned walking you know I'm very

554
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,200
I'm very, very lucky because the one game I have been playing a lot of is Guitar Hero,

555
00:35:56,200 --> 00:36:00,580
and I was carrying my guitar when I fell, and I'm just lucky the back of it hit the

556
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:03,920
curb and took chunks out of it versus the front or the buttons.

557
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:04,920
Ooh, yeah.

558
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:05,920
Yeah, so...

559
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,860
Wait, how did you fall with a Guitar Hero controller?

560
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:09,860
I was...

561
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:10,860
You know I have to ask.

562
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:12,560
I was holding a bunch of stuff.

563
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:17,660
I was going to my car from Mel's, it was like 1130 at night, and I was wearing my heels

564
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:21,240
from work, which I don't wear skinny ones, but still, they're heels.

565
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:25,400
So I had my Guitar Hero controller slung around, no I was holding the neck of it in my left

566
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:29,080
hand, I had my purse up there, and I was holding something else in my right hand.

567
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:33,320
I stepped up on a curb and I think I stepped onto a rock and it turned out from underneath

568
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,320
me.

569
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,320
And I went straight down.

570
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:37,180
Next thing I know I'm like, why am I on the ground?

571
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:40,040
And then Mel's looking at me like, why are you on the ground?

572
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:44,160
And then it hits me that the best thing to do in this situation would be curse loudly.

573
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,160
So I did.

574
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,640
And probably scared the shit out of the neighbors.

575
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:55,280
Yeah, so, um, yeah, the Guitar Hero controller hit the ground right next to me, so I have

576
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,840
a few little gouges out of the back of it, but it still plays.

577
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,840
But as long as it works, that's the important part.

578
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:02,840
Oh yeah, yeah, it still works, trust me.

579
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:06,400
Anything else you want to share about your week and your day?

580
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,000
Have you been doing the Mario Kart thing?

581
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
No.

582
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Oh.

583
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Okay, this is when you kick me.

584
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Mario Kart case!

585
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
This is when you kick me out of the house.

586
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
No, I'm not going to kick you out of the house.

587
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,120
I've never played Mario Kart ever.

588
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:20,720
The look of stunned silence is amazing.

589
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,720
I'm sorry, I just, I have to point and laugh.

590
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,020
Mm-hmm.

591
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:26,320
No, I'm just, that's, how, how did that happen?

592
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,920
You just not interested, or?

593
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,820
I just never, I, I just never really got into it,

594
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:32,620
and none of my friends really had it,

595
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:34,720
so I didn't have exposure to it that way.

596
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,520
And now you're handing me a DS with Mario Kart?

597
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,920
I was just telling Mel that I needed to play.

598
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,920
Play me.

599
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,120
Play me, Mario.

600
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:42,320
His DS is telling me to play it.

601
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,320
Play me.

602
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,120
There you go.

603
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:46,920
Actually, Mario's also sitting over there,

604
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:50,240
So you can play it too?

605
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,760
Pretty much my week has been walking,

606
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:55,140
and everything is going to be walking up until December 11th,

607
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:57,400
upon which at night it's party and collapse,

608
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,800
and then it's hang out in Hawaii time.

609
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:02,320
And then life returns to normal.

610
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:02,840
All right.

611
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,880
Yep, that was it.

612
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,700
Now, what's this part about how I'm

613
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:08,080
going to be joining you in Hawaii,

614
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,960
how you actually got me a ticket and was

615
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,920
going to surprise me on the show with it tonight?

616
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:12,760
What was this about?

617
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:15,720
Darn, you ruined the surprise, dammit.

618
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:19,720
Maybe next year, maybe next year I'll train, but

619
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:24,540
it's a lot of time. It is a lot of time, but honestly it's one of the

620
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:26,680
best experiences I've ever had in my life and I'm

621
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:30,760
so close with all these people I've been training with. It's a big commitment, but

622
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:31,080
it's

623
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:34,560
totally worth it. And if anyone wants to talk to me about it, go ahead and

624
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:38,080
email me, find me. I'll put a post on Orange Land or something. Sounds good.

625
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:43,720
Cool. Alright. Loki, how was your week? How was your day? My week was good until today.

626
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:48,440
or actually I should say yeah yeah until about today

627
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:51,960
I last week

628
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:55,960
I'm because I hadn't gotten an oil change in forever I decided to go and

629
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,520
get an oil change for my car

630
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:01,880
and like luck as it would be they fucked up my car

631
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:06,040
again. This isn't the same place that wrecked your old car.

632
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:10,880
Different place, different car, still fucking stuff up. So now my car leaks coolant

633
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:17,760
and, um, overheats thanks to them, and so now I gotta get that fixed, I gotta take work

634
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:25,520
off, it's just a pain in the ass, it really is, um, however, aside from that, see, cause

635
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:29,680
my whole week's been kind of doing the rollercoaster ride of highs and lows, last night we went

636
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:33,520
to the strip club and that was kind of fun, just because we had titties in our face all

637
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:40,520
night and, um, and lap dances, and so Nellie had a pretty good time. Um, and then, um,

638
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:44,700
I don't know, that was pretty much it, yeah, that was the highlights of the week. Oh, I

639
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:50,480
have Xbox 360 games and no Xbox system, and, uh, Gamestop was wonderful and decided to

640
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:54,420
go ahead and sell my copy of Project Gotham Racing, even though I had a pre-order for

641
00:39:54,420 --> 00:40:01,000
it, and came there, showed them my receipt, and they were like, uh, oops. So. It's fucking

642
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:05,800
ridiculous not nice and then I got a recorded message saying you're not going

643
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:09,880
to get your system till after Christmas which you know that's based on their

644
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:14,680
current allocations of what they're gonna get but it's just gonna be a big

645
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:19,640
giant circus this week so I'm looking forward to completely ignoring it that's

646
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:24,840
sorry I got Mario Kart I've got other games you know I could play I really

647
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:28,280
don't care and if I absolutely that's my only if I can't get an Xbox 360 I'll just

648
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:31,400
support other systems that have games out that I can actually get, you know.

649
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,920
Exactly, exactly.

650
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:37,480
My week in my day, not a whole lot of interest because I've just been working

651
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:40,840
like just crazy. It's horrible. I've been working

652
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:44,960
all the time, and

653
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:48,960
outside of that I picked up a couple new games. I picked up Ultramix 3, which we're going to talk about

654
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:52,840
after the next break, of course. Then I also picked up a copy of Mario Kart DS, which

655
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,760
has, you know, been a big part of the week as well.

656
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:55,920
and uh...

657
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,280
just you know

658
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:01,720
aria it's a fight in the least this is the ticket already that you said you

659
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:04,080
know we can i have not

660
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:07,760
read into your one i've attached world war craft in five days

661
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,960
i thought

662
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:12,820
well so that i've also taken a break from uh...

663
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:16,800
uh... i i i just i've been doing a lot of like sleeping in other stuff to just

664
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,160
his work has been that exhausting

665
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:21,600
interested

666
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:27,440
I was just saying, while we're on Mario Kart, I actually got to play the Mario Kart arcade version yesterday

667
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:30,840
at Milpitas Golf Land. It's actually pretty fun. They got

668
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:34,560
not only Nintendo, but Namco also was in on it.

669
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:38,880
So now you can write as Pac-Man, Ms. Pac-Man, or Blinky. I heard about that so

670
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:39,640
bad ass.

671
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:44,360
So they have that at Milpitas Golf Land? Yes they do. The only thing that sucks is they don't have card readers.

672
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:50,160
Aww. No! And it's like, oh, actually in a way it's bad, but it's good too because if

673
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:53,520
there was a car driver would drop by twenty bucks yesterday

674
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:57,360
okay so i'm going to a birthday party in hayward like in two weeks and i'm gonna

675
00:41:57,360 --> 00:42:00,760
have to swing by milpitas even though it's like an hour drive i don't care

676
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:04,040
about how are you like this first of december something it's like a friday

677
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:06,400
now the financial

678
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,280
uh... right now

679
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:11,160
going like dr i have to play i can't totally are in the power sliding isn't

680
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:14,120
like totally there but you can do like jump drift

681
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:16,680
so you know it's a little different but they have like all the courses there

682
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:19,280
You can do the jump drifts in this to kind of use that same thing. Yeah

683
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:22,040
Yeah, where you like to get to the gas and you hit the brake and then yeah

684
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:25,720
You can do that sorta sorta and this one you wiggle back and forth after you do a jump. Yeah

685
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:32,400
Oh, wow, kind of interesting. So anyway, alright, we're gonna go to another break. I want to talk a lot about Ultramix 3 tonight

686
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,660
I know you guys have your opinions you want to state too

687
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:37,740
We're gonna get to all of that right after this next break

688
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:40,520
But we need to take a break because I need something to drink something stiff

689
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:44,420
In this break, we're gonna hear some more Ultramix 3 music in this break

690
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:48,800
We're gonna hear I am gothic because I love this song. Where's your head at by Basement Jacks?

691
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:53,740
Nari Nari by J. Dobby. It's a little bit of a like Bollywood type

692
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:59,140
It's kind of cool and then a stakeout the ultra mix by freeze pop so we're gonna hear all that this break

693
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:01,460
We'll be back with more Orange on a Tradio after this.

694
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:32,260
Buried in glue, I'm just now breathing

695
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:36,180
I consider it true, it's a fuzzy dark country

696
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:39,060
Feel my pain, all alone and safe

697
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:41,060
May I still make my way?

698
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:48,340
Catch the ghost race, it's the center of my heart

699
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:53,380
I am hopeless, I'm found

700
00:43:53,380 --> 00:44:09,380
I am nothing, I am frail, I am scary, I know the same, I am a loner, I am cold, I feel

701
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:19,380
special when people come close, I am nothing, I am pale, I am scary, I am insane, I am a

702
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:21,380
I am your

703
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:23,380
I feel essential

704
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:25,380
When people come for you

705
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:43,620
Where's your head at?

706
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:47,620
Where's your hand at?

707
00:44:58,620 --> 00:45:01,620
Where's your hand at?

708
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:03,620
Where's your hand at?

709
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:05,620
Where's your hand at now?

710
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:07,620
Drop it!

711
00:45:09,620 --> 00:45:11,620
Okay, are you ready?

712
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:23,620
I know you work across the street in the indie breakfast store

713
00:48:23,620 --> 00:48:26,620
I'm thinking sometimes that won't mean I'm thinking we'll do something more

714
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:29,620
I hide behind my back seat, then I see a walk on by

715
00:48:29,620 --> 00:48:33,620
But I'm not ready to be seen, I'll just sit right here and have a goodbye

716
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:52,620
I'll take advantage of your feelings in me lately

717
00:48:52,620 --> 00:48:54,620
I need my time

718
00:48:55,620 --> 00:49:00,620
Now I know that you're with me now

719
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:17,620
I must get out of college and go to school

720
00:49:47,620 --> 00:49:59,620
Orange Lounge Radio, Bahmani Music, and more.

721
00:49:59,620 --> 00:50:01,260
Perfect!

722
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:04,660
We're back here on Orange Lounge Radio and on that break you heard I Am Gothic by Spray,

723
00:50:04,660 --> 00:50:08,460
Where's Your Head At, Basement Jaxx, which by the way has a very freaky video, it's in

724
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:14,500
that mix, Nari Nariin by J. Dabi, and Stake Out, the Ultra Mix by Freeze Pop.

725
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:19,100
I don't want to say too much, but please keep your fingers crossed for me.

726
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:22,340
I got a contact over at Freeze Pop, and I'm trying to get them on the show.

727
00:50:22,340 --> 00:50:26,600
So please pray to whatever deity that we can get them on the show, because I love Freeze

728
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:27,600
Pop.

729
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:28,600
I would love to have them on the program.

730
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:32,260
And if anybody out there from the Freeze Pop camp is listening, please come on the show!

731
00:50:32,260 --> 00:50:33,260
Please!

732
00:50:33,260 --> 00:50:34,260
You're super...

733
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:35,260
Okay, so we'll see what happens.

734
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:38,060
We made our freaks look so uber-chic.

735
00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:39,060
We shop at Target.

736
00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:40,060
Trust me.

737
00:50:40,060 --> 00:50:41,060
No, seriously.

738
00:50:41,060 --> 00:50:43,740
I shop so much at Target.

739
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:44,740
It's disgusting.

740
00:50:44,740 --> 00:50:46,600
Probably this whole house is furnished with Tarjay.

741
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:50,620
The thing with Tarjay that reminds me is the sad news about Vanilla Coke's passing.

742
00:50:50,620 --> 00:50:55,560
I can remember going to a Tarjay with you and finding every damn bottle of Vanilla Coke

743
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:58,440
they had and buying it when it first came out.

744
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:00,200
I have that picture in my cubicle.

745
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:02,200
The picture's at work.

746
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:03,200
It makes me sad.

747
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:06,960
I'll have to put that next to the picture of me as a toddler with Crystal Pepsi.

748
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:08,960
No, I'm kidding.

749
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:09,960
Alright.

750
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:10,960
Rob!

751
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:11,960
What?

752
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:16,960
What? I traced that stuff too. No, I know I didn't. I wasn't a toddler.

753
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:21,960
That shit was that one when we were in junior high or so. They're about the same age.

754
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:26,960
Don't forget I'm not that much younger than you are.

755
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:31,960
Sir. I'm getting yelled at by the chat room. Chat room by the way. www.orangelambsrader.com

756
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:36,960
Click on chat. MPQ says stop saying Tarjay. Hey, it's better than the new one

757
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:40,220
I've started hearing recently because all my friends shop there tar gay

758
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:48,980
So if you want buddy, no, all right, we all know it's target no, that's right, but but I like that target

759
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:55,600
They come on. It makes it sound chic makes it sound like sax fifth tar. J. That's great. We have to feel upper-class

760
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:58,380
Okay. Yeah, no, at least it's not Kmart a

761
00:51:58,380 --> 00:52:04,860
Kmart is like, you heard that Martha Stewart was thinking about buying Kmart, and they

762
00:52:04,860 --> 00:52:11,860
were going to call it K-Martha, that's not a fucking joke, that's not a fucking joke!

763
00:52:11,860 --> 00:52:15,460
But they're having like this huge sale, and anyway, it's just ghetto, Kmart's ghetto,

764
00:52:15,460 --> 00:52:20,380
why would Martha Stewart want to buy Kmart? Kmart is ghetto, it is so ghetto, and ghetto

765
00:52:20,380 --> 00:52:23,980
people shop there too, and I'm not trying to say anything because ghetto people can

766
00:52:23,980 --> 00:52:28,940
be any color, any shape, any size. They are just some ghetto people that shop at Kmart,

767
00:52:28,940 --> 00:52:33,540
at least here. I don't know about your neck of the woods, but Kmart is ghetto. All right,

768
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:40,100
anyway. I want to talk about Ultramix 3. Am I the only one in the room that's actually

769
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:44,020
played Ultramix 3 today? No, Mel's played too? Okay, so I'm glad we can get a couple

770
00:52:44,020 --> 00:52:46,660
opinions here. Well, the rest of you guys have heard some of the songs. I know I played

771
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:52,120
some of it for Loki there a little bit before the show. Let's start with the things I like

772
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:56,880
about DDR UltraMix III.

773
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:01,160
No, I'm kidding. There's actually a lot to like about UltraMix III. I like Xbox Live.

774
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:05,160
Xbox Live is a lot cleaner. It's a lot better, I think. I like the fact that you

775
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:07,360
can send messages to people within Xbox Live.

776
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:11,280
I like how you don't have to quit out of the game and come back in to

777
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:15,760
download new stuff that the new content stuff is integrated into the game.

778
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:18,700
I think they did a very good job with that and sending the messages back to each

779
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:19,040
other

780
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:23,200
and seeing who all is online playing the game not necessarily in your room

781
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:27,080
I think that's all great so the Xbox Live portion looks great love it

782
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:30,600
song list is half and half for me

783
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:33,760
there's some awesome stuff in the song list like just

784
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:38,840
I love the spray song I love the real life song I love the gothian trancy

785
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:39,920
stuff I always do though

786
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:43,900
and then I love some of the stuff that they brought over from other

787
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:47,080
bimani stuff is great like right on time from guitar for you says great himawari

788
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:51,760
from Guitar Freaks as well. Parade of the Wooden Soldiers,

789
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:56,920
WTF, but that's kinda neat. Akumajo Dracula Medley, of course, was an awesome pick.

790
00:53:56,920 --> 00:54:02,240
They picked some good stuff. But then the song list kinda goes weird for me because

791
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:06,520
they tried with the song list in UltraMix 3 to be much more eclectic and that is

792
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:06,960
very

793
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:12,040
obvious. Like they have more rap type stuff with the alphabet aerobics and

794
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:16,480
and Run DMC and they have some rock type stuff with Good Charlotte

795
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:19,880
and The Clash and No FX

796
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:23,320
and then they have some old stuff like they have

797
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:27,960
Ray Charles with What You Say. Let me play a clip of some of these like songs

798
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:32,360
these are songs that literally made me go WTF when I brought them up

799
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:36,640
in UltraMix 3 and I actually I got a copy of some of this music so we can play it for you guys

800
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:37,520
here on the show tonight

801
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:40,620
I'm not gonna play the whole one but I want I wanna see if you guys have the

802
00:54:40,620 --> 00:54:41,200
same

803
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:45,160
reaction I did to this okay imagine you're going through the song list and then

804
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:45,840
suddenly

805
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:50,160
you come across this, okay? Listen to a little clip of this song

806
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:54,160
and imagine arrows coming up the screen and all that.

807
00:54:54,160 --> 00:55:01,480
She the girl with the record song, she can do the burnin' all night long, yeah.

808
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:08,080
What I say, all right.

809
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:15,280
Well, tell me what I say, tell me what I say, baby, tell me what I say.

810
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:21,880
Okay. Here's my thing. Is that song a good song? Yes, it's an awesome song. It's a wonderful

811
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:25,520
song. It's an incredible song. I love that song. It's great. Is it a good choice for

812
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:30,480
DDR? Hell no it's not a good pick for DDR. Hell no. What?

813
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:34,560
I'm like going, eh? I know. I know. That's what I want. And I tried

814
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:38,120
playing it and the steps, you know, were okay considering, you know, the song, you know,

815
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:42,240
they did the best they could with the song. But I like playing DDR because this is one

816
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:47,480
big thing that draws me to DDR. It's like a big jukebox. It's like the jukebox of now.

817
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:55,100
And having to play that song that sounds like it is a copy of a copy of a copy from 19 whatever,

818
00:55:55,100 --> 00:55:59,900
I don't know. I can't get into it. I can't get into that song. Okay? Here's another classic

819
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:07,940
example of, and this is another, now this, I don't know. I don't know how to describe

820
00:56:07,940 --> 00:56:12,060
it. Here's another pick that was in the game and you tell me how I'm supposed to dance

821
00:56:12,060 --> 00:56:19,060
to this.

822
00:56:35,380 --> 00:56:39,320
I feel like I'm playing DDR at Chevy's all of a sudden. Is the background to that song

823
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:46,320
a flea market? No. Stop it with a horribly... No, but they did use the little cactus guys

824
00:56:46,580 --> 00:56:53,580
from Tomlinson Couple and all that, whatever. Again, is that a bad song? No, it's not a

825
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:58,120
bad song. I mean, I don't choose to listen to that kind of music usually, but I think,

826
00:56:58,120 --> 00:57:02,880
you know, if I'm in the mood, if I'm drinking some margaritas, you know, that's good music

827
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:08,200
to be hearing. But is that stuff I want to play in DDR? No. Here's my problem with the

828
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:15,520
the song list Konami. If it ain't broke, don't fucking fix it. And Ultramix 2 had the best

829
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:20,060
song list. It was incredible. It was a great song list. All these unknowns coming from

830
00:57:20,060 --> 00:57:26,000
a different drum and great transplants and remixes like Jairus. Awesome. Why did they

831
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:30,520
break the formula? Why did they go and try to change it? Why were they suddenly like,

832
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:36,440
oh, let's be as eclectic as we possibly can be and let's throw in the clash for no real

833
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:41,880
good reason other than we want to pay homage to The Clash. You know what? Let's put in

834
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:47,780
Ray Charles for no good reason other than we want to pay homage to Ray Charles. I don't

835
00:57:47,780 --> 00:57:52,400
get it. Something doesn't add up for me there. Maybe I'm just a stuck up snobby asshole when

836
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:57,960
it comes to my music, but I played those songs once and I will probably not play them again.

837
00:57:57,960 --> 00:58:02,520
Which is too bad because, you know, one thing, and going back into things I like about Ultra

838
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:08,360
Mix 3. The steps are great, and the steps were great in UltraMix 2, and as I understand

839
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:13,120
that they made changes with who's doing the steps at Konami, but with the other mixes

840
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:18,680
on into UltraMix 2, and it was a change for the better, because they got, you know, folks

841
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:22,680
that were, from what we understand and what we're hearing, folks that were in the know

842
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:27,920
on their DDR making the steps. So, and they've kept that for UltraMix 3, so that's great

843
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:31,000
too, because the steps are all really cool, and they do some new things with them too,

844
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:35,700
which is kind of neat. I was almost surprised, though, that they didn't try to get steps

845
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:40,000
running backward yet, because that's the only thing we haven't seen in DDR yet, and in that

846
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:43,940
Hey Mama song, there's a part where it totally could have ran backwards. It's awesome. I

847
00:58:43,940 --> 00:58:45,620
don't know. Anyway, just a weird thought.

848
00:58:45,620 --> 00:58:50,180
Actually, the whole backwards thing was an idea we tried to pitch for UltraMix 2 with

849
00:58:50,180 --> 00:58:53,340
the Max 300 remix, where it kind of goes, rit, rit, rit, rit.

850
00:58:53,340 --> 00:58:54,340
Oh, yeah.

851
00:58:54,340 --> 00:58:58,460
Because it sounds like it's being played backwards. We were trying, like, hell to get the engineering

852
00:58:58,460 --> 00:59:02,940
to work, but it's Hawaii we expect. We'll get on that later.

853
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:08,980
You know what, I noticed this attitude of WTF Hawaii, and I'm all about showing Hawaii

854
00:59:08,980 --> 00:59:13,780
a little love after Ultra Mix 2, and I said on this show, and I do not take it back, that

855
00:59:13,780 --> 00:59:18,660
if Konami puts out another arcade mix, Hawaii should be the one doing it. However, I would

856
00:59:18,660 --> 00:59:23,180
like to go back and amend my previous statement to say, whoever did Ultra Mix 2 should be

857
00:59:23,180 --> 00:59:26,900
doing it. Because Ultra Mix 3, whoever was calling the shots with the song list, I'm

858
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:31,000
I'm sorry I'm not feeling the love here. I'm not feeling it. And there's other big, big

859
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:36,260
problems with UltraMix 3. Now, I'm not saying UltraMix 3 is a bad game, because it's a great

860
00:59:36,260 --> 00:59:39,400
game. And if you own an Xbox, you should be fucking buying this game. You should. There's

861
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:44,280
no question about it. But there are some problems that really make me go WTF. Here is another

862
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:55,120
huge ass problem. The song packs from UltraMix 2 are horribly off sync. Don't believe me?

863
00:59:55,120 --> 01:00:02,120
this out. I have proof that the songs are off sync. Because there might be people out

864
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:06,700
there that say, oh Rob, you're just playing on your TV. You just think they're off sync.

865
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:09,120
It feels like you're off sync because you're not hitting the buttons at the right time.

866
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:14,320
No, no, no. I have proof. What I did is I took the song into training mode and put it

867
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:19,320
on with claps, so you can hear exactly where the arrows fall in the song. Listen to this.

868
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:46,240
Wait, hold on, I want you to listen to that part carefully again, because those notes

869
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:49,240
are supposed to go with that when it comes to that doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo

870
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:52,520
listen that the claps start like almost a full

871
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:55,520
second before it really happens listen again

872
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:04,440
now listen to this next part coming up with the freezes

873
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:07,440
all the notes are on the upbeats watch this

874
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:18,480
Those steps are supposed to be on the sirens!

875
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:19,480
You get my picture?

876
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:25,080
Wow, I totally feel like I'm flashback to two years ago QA'ing UltraMix 1, where it

877
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:26,280
was horribly off.

878
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:31,280
Well apparently somebody forgot to QA the second song packs or something, I don't know.

879
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:34,520
But now the community who paid five bucks for those songs hoping that they get to play

880
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:36,680
them on UltraMix 3, they're pissed!

881
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:39,640
they're pissed because they can't play those songs in Ultramix City, they're ruined!

882
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:43,640
We were doing, we played, I was playing on live the other day with people, I don't know

883
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:47,080
these people, they're just random people on live, I, I, we, that song came up, we did

884
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:50,400
like a random pick, I don't know, and that song came up, and we played that on live,

885
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:54,480
and everybody was like, what the fuck, this song is fucked, what happened to this?

886
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:59,480
Hey, now you know why we have such a huge freaking timing window in, uh, Ultramix.

887
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:06,240
That was disabled the flaw, by the way, from Song Pack 9, if you don't believe me.

888
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:09,760
So there it is, audio proof that the damn thing is off sync.

889
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:13,400
And they should put out a patch, now the community is saying, you gotta patch it, you gotta patch

890
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:14,400
it, put out a patch.

891
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:17,840
I'm wondering if they can put out a patch, the game's probably not built to take a patch,

892
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:18,840
I don't know.

893
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:20,400
Because like Halo's different.

894
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:24,660
When you go to Halo, Halo connects to the internet right away and if it sees the patch

895
01:02:24,660 --> 01:02:25,660
it gets it.

896
01:02:25,660 --> 01:02:29,760
If DER was not set up to do that, you're not gonna be able to get a patch that easy.

897
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:30,760
So I don't know.

898
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:32,080
I don't know what they're gonna do.

899
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:34,520
I doubt they're gonna do anything.

900
01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:40,520
You can patch a game like that, just like they patched WWE WrestleMania 21.

901
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:42,520
They can do a patch on that.

902
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:43,520
Alright.

903
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:45,520
Here we go.

904
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:46,520
I want to play this as well.

905
01:02:46,520 --> 01:02:50,320
This is the other thing that pisses me off, and once again I have audio proof that this

906
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:53,860
pisses me off, and you cannot dispute this.

907
01:02:53,860 --> 01:02:56,320
You cannot.

908
01:02:56,320 --> 01:02:58,520
Here's my beef.

909
01:02:58,520 --> 01:03:02,480
Loading times in UltraMix series have been kind of iffy as it is, okay?

910
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:04,820
Now I would like to show you what it's like to load the game.

911
01:03:04,820 --> 01:03:08,680
Now I'm not even counting in the beginning, the game loads up, da da da, you get to the

912
01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:10,080
title screen, okay?

913
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:14,160
What happens is that then there's a moment where it goes, loading song packs, and you

914
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:17,560
have to wait, and you see these little bubble animations on the screen while it's loading

915
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:21,640
your song packs, which okay, makes sense, that's how, even though the song packs are

916
01:03:21,640 --> 01:03:25,600
off sync and not worth loading anyway, this is how it, you know, brings them into the

917
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:26,600
game.

918
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:29,280
However, I would like to play for you guys, this is a direct audio rip, I am not fudging

919
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:33,040
anything here this is a direct audio rip from earlier today when I was booting up

920
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:36,040
the game and playing. So you're gonna hear the title music for just a minute

921
01:03:36,040 --> 01:03:38,780
and then you're gonna hear bloop bloop that is the game starting to load after

922
01:03:38,780 --> 01:03:41,560
I hit the A button and I'm not going to shorten this or anything this is

923
01:03:41,560 --> 01:03:48,080
seriously how long the load time is. Okay so here's a little tile screen okay and

924
01:03:48,080 --> 01:04:02,000
And then here we go.

925
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,000
God damn it, Rob.

926
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:08,000
Stop farting in the bathtub.

927
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:15,040
Spin it out.

928
01:04:15,040 --> 01:04:17,640
See?

929
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:18,640
30 seconds.

930
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:25,640
I think I'll go get up and make a sandwich.

931
01:04:25,640 --> 01:04:28,640
A little bit longer than William Hung's stardom.

932
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:42,640
That is a tasty burger.

933
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:47,640
Oh, I wonder if my game is going to load any day now.

934
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:52,640
Wow, I really have to play some DDR today.

935
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:57,640
Oh! There we go! Finally! The goddamn thing loaded! Finally!

936
01:04:57,640 --> 01:05:07,640
One minute, five seconds! One whole minute for the goddamn song packs to load and they don't even work!

937
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:16,640
Needless to say, if that's going to be the case, importing the song packs probably should have been an option that you could choose to do before you go into the game.

938
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:20,640
I don't know. Or maybe just optimize your thing a little better. I don't know.

939
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:26,640
You know, they say that DDR is exercise. This exercise would be screaming at the freaking console for it to load faster.

940
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:29,640
That is just crazy.

941
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:31,640
She's exercising patience.

942
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:39,640
Welcome to DDR! Now we're going to exercise your patience!

943
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:41,640
Jesus.

944
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:48,640
Anyway, I don't know what else to say about that. Come on!

945
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:51,640
Alright, so I'm dogging on the game a little bit.

946
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:57,640
All in all though, it's not bad. I just liked Ultra Mix 2 a little bit better.

947
01:05:57,640 --> 01:05:59,640
Mel, what are your thoughts?

948
01:05:59,640 --> 01:06:05,640
Well, I guess I liked it better because I was on Ultramix 2. Who knows? It's a curse, perhaps.

949
01:06:05,640 --> 01:06:19,640
No, but just from, I guess, talking to people who are on the project and such, I think either Hawaii or RMC, spending a little too much time on things that were not all that crucial.

950
01:06:19,640 --> 01:06:24,640
Like, I heard Quest Mode got way too much more attention than it really needed to be.

951
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:28,640
Oh, god, I didn't even mention Quest Mode. I mean, Quest Mode is...

952
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:32,640
I mean, I guess it's cute, but the thing...

953
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:36,640
The setup in EX2 was way better. Whatever that thing was, I don't even remember.

954
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:40,640
Mission Mode or whatever, it was way better. That's what I expected Quest Mode was going to be.

955
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:44,640
I didn't realize Quest Mode was just, play a lot of DDR and get shit.

956
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:46,640
That's basically what Quest Mode is.

957
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:50,640
Yeah, and there's so many bugs you get to gain more points or money or whatever.

958
01:06:50,640 --> 01:07:03,640
You can actually load your own edits into it, and like, what they did was, they would do like all sixteenths in like a circle pattern, so you just sit there and you rub the controller, boom, you know, so you jack up the, you know, points hardcore.

959
01:07:03,640 --> 01:07:15,640
Um, other than that, I mean, like, Songlist, I think it's sort of like, it's kind of like the iPod shuffle theory, they think, wow, if we can get it as broad as possible, we're gonna look that much cooler, you know, but...

960
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:19,640
At the risk of alienating your fanbase that supported you through Ultramix 2?

961
01:07:19,640 --> 01:07:27,640
Basically, I mean, you know, I know they want to be different, it's a good thing, you know, I mean UltraMix, you know, has its own identity for the most part, but...

962
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:38,640
Let's face it, we had to forgive Hawaii an awful lot for UltraMix 1, and then, you know, for UltraMix 2 it was like, okay guys, okay, you proved yourselves with UltraMix 2, we're cool, we can be a happy family, just don't disappoint us again.

963
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:41,640
And then, pfft, Songlist was woo!

964
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:45,640
Is it gonna be like Madden, where every other year it's good, and every other year it sucks?

965
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:48,640
It sucks. It's like the Star Treks. The even number ones are good.

966
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:50,640
Exactly!

967
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:52,640
We'll see.

968
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:54,640
Con!

969
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:56,640
Shut up, all of you.

970
01:07:57,640 --> 01:07:59,640
Stop ruining this station. Alright.

971
01:07:59,640 --> 01:08:01,640
Anything else, Mil?

972
01:08:01,640 --> 01:08:05,640
I think, you know, they just put a little too much into the game.

973
01:08:05,640 --> 01:08:08,640
You know, just like, there's that whole dance, you know, freestyle mode and all that.

974
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:12,640
I think they could have done without, you know, most of it is like spend more time on

975
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:17,600
You know the actual gameplay itself on the timing windows and all that I mean granted. It's not as big as like

976
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:22,480
Alaska now you know now as big as, Nevada you know but um

977
01:08:23,320 --> 01:08:27,040
Well, I think maybe it's the kind of thing where they're like well. They're not gonna notice it

978
01:08:27,320 --> 01:08:31,920
Well, I think it looks you forgot how rabid these DDR freaks can be yes

979
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:37,480
You're gonna notice engineers don't notice it. You know the QA people do you know I mean yeah

980
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:39,480
They have on there. You know they know there's

981
01:08:39,480 --> 01:08:48,480
I have a feeling that they knew some of this stuff was going on, and I don't know, I don't know, I can't speculate too much.

982
01:08:48,480 --> 01:08:55,480
I don't know if it's just reticence or laziness or what, you know, I ain't gonna say one way or another because I haven't nearly been close to the situation.

983
01:08:55,480 --> 01:09:02,480
But, you know, overall, hey, you know, they figured DDR, it's Xbox, it has to sell, you know.

984
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:14,480
I know. I just hope when they do Ultramix 4 or Xbox 360 DDR, whatever's next for them, assuming there's going to be another mix, which there has to be. I can't see DDR dying just because the song list pissed me off.

985
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:23,480
I want there to be another mix. The mix, overall, isn't bad. It's not. It's a good game, again. I'm just saying that. These little things make me mad.

986
01:09:23,480 --> 01:09:29,960
but when they do the future mix I just you know I hope they I hope they stick

987
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:34,640
with the things that worked for them in Ultramix 2 and yeah what else can I say

988
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:37,520
I don't know I would like to see them shake up the interface a little more to

989
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:41,680
Ultramix 3 felt like Ultramix 2 plus in a lot of ways because then they didn't

990
01:09:41,680 --> 01:09:44,640
really change the interface except the bubbles which and I'm okay with the

991
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:47,760
bubbles thing but where the bubbles thing got god-awful was like the little

992
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:54,400
reflections in the bubbles blocks the graphics. It's like, okay, somebody in the art department

993
01:09:54,400 --> 01:10:02,120
wasn't thinking that whole thing out or something. I don't know. So, whatever. Anyway, any other

994
01:10:02,120 --> 01:10:07,040
comments from anybody on Ultramix 3? You guys asleep over here? Mario Kart over here, Loki?

995
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:14,680
Hey, I haven't played Ultramix 3, so I can't comment, other than that some of the music

996
01:10:14,680 --> 01:10:20,540
is really weird yeah I almost want it you know say oh what the hell you know

997
01:10:20,540 --> 01:10:24,640
go ahead and get it because I have one in two sitting at home also is the online

998
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:28,880
mode any better than extreme twos online oh the online mode is incredible the

999
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:32,520
online mode is great it's the best online does it still have tournament

1000
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:35,680
mode in there where you can run a tournament on it I think so but I'm

1001
01:10:35,680 --> 01:10:42,920
gonna be honest I didn't really look okay all right we're gonna another

1002
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:46,120
break you guys when we come back from this break you guys will have a chance

1003
01:10:46,120 --> 01:10:49,680
to give your thoughts on UltraMix3 and anything else is on your mind. I know we

1004
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:52,520
have some folks that want to talk about this MTV taping some of them went to on

1005
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:55,980
the east coast and want to call in talk about this, some other random stories you

1006
01:10:55,980 --> 01:10:59,080
guys wanna talk about it's your show when we come back from this break and we open up the

1007
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:03,420
skype line. And Orange Lounge Goes to the Movies. Orange Lounge Goes to the Movies will

1008
01:11:03,420 --> 01:11:06,320
definitely work in too probably just before Cajemash night. We're going to

1009
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:09,480
do the skype line when we come back from this break with more UltraMix3 music

1010
01:11:09,480 --> 01:11:12,320
and I know you guys are sending me requests but we're not gonna be able to

1011
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:15,440
do request until kind of later. I do want to definitely get the Ultramix 3 music out

1012
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:19,380
there so you guys can hear it. That's kind of the number one priority right now. Alright,

1013
01:11:19,380 --> 01:11:23,340
now first we're going to start off with what is probably my personal favorite song on Ultramix

1014
01:11:23,340 --> 01:11:27,380
3, and again this was sticking to getting music from different drum and the indie record

1015
01:11:27,380 --> 01:11:34,380
labels that worked. This is Conflict by the Azoic. Enjoy.

1016
01:12:27,380 --> 01:12:30,380
You told me, told me, told me

1017
01:12:30,380 --> 01:12:32,380
You told me, told me, told me

1018
01:12:32,380 --> 01:12:34,380
Please don't play

1019
01:12:34,380 --> 01:12:37,380
Show me fear, I know now

1020
01:12:37,380 --> 01:12:39,380
But for some fear

1021
01:12:39,380 --> 01:12:42,380
I saw one thing that I know

1022
01:12:42,380 --> 01:12:45,380
I was too young to know

1023
01:12:45,380 --> 01:12:49,380
And I never knew what to do

1024
01:12:51,380 --> 01:12:53,380
It's a beauty

1025
01:12:53,380 --> 01:12:55,380
Oh

1026
01:13:53,380 --> 01:14:14,980
I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you

1027
01:14:44,980 --> 01:15:08,380
We were at a party Everybody had matching towels

1028
01:15:08,380 --> 01:15:10,860
Somebody waits under a rock

1029
01:15:10,860 --> 01:15:12,920
And there they saw a rock

1030
01:15:13,720 --> 01:15:15,220
It wasn't a rock

1031
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:18,980
But the rock, rock the rock

1032
01:15:23,740 --> 01:15:25,340
Rock, rock, rock

1033
01:15:29,100 --> 01:15:30,340
Rock, rock, rock

1034
01:16:00,340 --> 01:16:02,340
Rock

1035
01:16:02,340 --> 01:16:04,340
Action

1036
01:16:04,340 --> 01:16:06,340
Rock

1037
01:16:16,340 --> 01:16:18,340
Rock, rock

1038
01:16:48,340 --> 01:16:53,340
When I'm goin' to court, a white suit When I'm gettin' divorced, a black suit

1039
01:16:53,340 --> 01:16:57,340
At the funeral home and my birthday too When I'm home alone, talkin' on the phone

1040
01:16:57,340 --> 01:17:00,340
Got an interview with the Rolling Stone, they're sayin'

1041
01:17:00,340 --> 01:17:04,340
Now you're rich and now you're famous Fake-ass girls all know your name and

1042

1048
01:17:44,140 --> 01:17:48,040
Where you're coming from, we've already seen the words that this life can bring

1049
01:17:48,040 --> 01:17:51,780
Now we've expected everywhere that we go

Orange Lounge Radio

1067
01:18:20,620 --> 01:18:21,320
breakers

1068
01:18:21,460 --> 01:18:21,960
Bahmani Music

1069
01:18:22,680 --> 01:18:23,340
And more

1070
01:18:23,340 --> 01:18:26,780
Perfect!

1071
01:18:26,780 --> 01:18:29,340
Hi kids, we're back here on Orange Lounge Radio

1072
01:18:29,340 --> 01:18:33,820
and in that break you heard some more music from the DDR Ultramix 3 including

1073
01:18:33,820 --> 01:18:36,060
Conflict by the Azoic,

1074
01:18:36,060 --> 01:18:38,260
Why by Neveraka,

1075
01:18:38,260 --> 01:18:43,080
Rock Lobster by the B-52s, and I Just Wanna Live by Good Charlotte's all in that

1076
01:18:43,080 --> 01:18:43,940
mix, so

1077
01:18:43,940 --> 01:18:48,500
you know I was a little iffy with Good Charlotte being in Ultramix but

1078
01:18:48,500 --> 01:18:52,520
that sounds not so bad, it could have been a lot worse that's for sure, I don't know

1079
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:55,980
but I don't listen to pop radio either so

1080
01:18:55,980 --> 01:19:00,160
we'll see. Anyway, God, I just clicked a little button on

1081
01:19:00,160 --> 01:19:03,720
Skype that says we're taking calls now and that we just get hammered with people but

1082
01:19:03,720 --> 01:19:06,160
let's go to the first call. Hi, you're on Orange Orange Radio.

1083
01:19:06,160 --> 01:19:09,280
Hey, it's... Hey, it's who?

1084
01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:13,360
Jazz. Hey, Jazz, how you doing? Uh, pretty good.

1085
01:19:13,360 --> 01:19:16,440
Alright, what do you think about DDR UltraMix III?

1086
01:19:16,440 --> 01:19:21,320
Oh, as you know, I've always been a huge supporter of

1087
01:19:21,320 --> 01:19:24,960
the ultimate you get your volume just went down by half i don't know if you

1088
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:29,380
move michael there we go

1089
01:19:29,380 --> 01:19:31,780
now we can't hear you at all

1090
01:19:31,780 --> 01:19:32,820
i think

1091
01:19:32,820 --> 01:19:36,060
i think that better area yes much better what that

1092
01:19:36,060 --> 01:19:40,620
okay i've always been a huge order

1093
01:19:40,620 --> 01:19:43,940
this makes kind of drop the bomb in a lot of areas

1094
01:19:43,940 --> 01:19:48,060
come on and drop the bomb do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do

1095
01:19:48,060 --> 01:19:53,060
Alright, I'm kidding. You know I couldn't resist. Why did it drop the bomb?

1096
01:19:53,060 --> 01:19:58,060
Well, for one they added a bunch of rock songs that we didn't need to hear.

1097
01:19:58,060 --> 01:20:09,060
I'll give you that. I understand no FX and The Clash wanting to pay homage to them, but I don't think they really worked for DDR. I didn't get that.

1098
01:20:09,060 --> 01:20:16,060
Yeah, but mostly I think the song pack thing is completely unforgivable. I don't get that at all.

1099
01:20:16,060 --> 01:20:18,600
Did you hear the little audio clip I played earlier?

1100
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:23,000
Yeah, and I've been playing, I've been trying to play the songs, and a lot of them are songs

1101
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,920
I've loved, like Diamond Jealousy and R5.

1102
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:27,960
And yeah, it's not just limited to like three songs.

1103
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:32,660
I know Rini compiled some stuff and put it on the DR Freak forum, and probably half the

1104
01:20:32,660 --> 01:20:36,840
other forums out there on the internet, and it's got like Jack and Mark Get Busy, and

1105
01:20:36,840 --> 01:20:37,840
all these other songs.

1106
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:41,040
I mean, it's like a list of like ten songs that are broken in the song packs.

1107
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:42,660
It's sucky.

1108
01:20:42,660 --> 01:20:43,840
It's ridiculous.

1109
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:45,800
It's completely unprofessional, in my opinion.

1110
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:48,320
Yeah, it sucks. It sucks.

1111
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:51,480
I don't know how. How did they miss that? That's what I want to know. It's like somebody

1112
01:20:51,480 --> 01:20:55,420
didn't even test to see if the song packs worked. I don't know. How do you miss that?

1113
01:20:55,420 --> 01:20:56,720
I don't know.

1114
01:20:56,720 --> 01:21:00,200
Or they knew about it and just didn't give a shit. I don't know.

1115
01:21:00,200 --> 01:21:02,100
Yeah, something like that. Who knows.

1116
01:21:02,100 --> 01:21:04,800
What else? Any other thoughts you have on Ultramix 3?

1117
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:07,260
Um, a lot of things I like

1118
01:21:07,260 --> 01:21:12,260
is a bunch of songs like So Many Times, which I absolutely love.

1119
01:21:12,260 --> 01:21:15,940
I think we have that queued for the next break, so we'll play that, definitely.

1120
01:21:15,940 --> 01:21:19,380
Yeah, the steps are really good this time.

1121
01:21:19,380 --> 01:21:23,420
The steps are all pretty good, especially when you consider that

1122
01:21:23,420 --> 01:21:26,620
there are some songs where it's like, you know, this shouldn't even be in DDR.

1123
01:21:26,620 --> 01:21:29,620
The steps, they do the best they can, you know what I mean?

1124
01:21:29,620 --> 01:21:33,500
Yeah, like even the songs that aren't made for DDR, like

1125
01:21:33,500 --> 01:21:36,620
Meowma and all that, they're just

1126
01:21:36,620 --> 01:21:40,100
fun to play, so.

1127
01:21:40,100 --> 01:21:44,620
I just, whereas the steps are good, I'm not going to knock the steps because they do the

1128
01:21:44,620 --> 01:21:45,620
best they can.

1129
01:21:45,620 --> 01:21:48,980
It's not fun to play because the song makes my ears want to, you know, scream out in pain.

1130
01:21:48,980 --> 01:21:54,340
I can't play it, so.

1131
01:21:54,340 --> 01:22:00,980
Besides that, I'm kind of iffy about the online because it's a lot better this time.

1132
01:22:00,980 --> 01:22:06,160
I think the online is like the best part too, is like they really improved online support.

1133
01:22:06,160 --> 01:22:12,320
But the scoring is still a little iffy, because if you get a full combo, you instantly win,

1134
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:19,000
which is really annoying. Because, you know, I've been through like multiple players already

1135
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:24,080
where they've gotten 50 greats and I've gotten 7, and I lose, and I'm like, what the fuck?

1136
01:22:24,080 --> 01:22:28,120
Why, because you didn't get a full combo? Yeah, I got a miss because the controller

1137
01:22:28,120 --> 01:22:34,800
for Xbox is completely CDR. Yeah, I don't know if it's keeping track of

1138
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:38,580
my win-loss record appropriately, but I do like the fact that it shows on the little

1139
01:22:38,580 --> 01:22:43,740
preview like what your highest score is, because in my case I have a triple A, so my highest

1140
01:22:43,740 --> 01:22:46,640
score is like a perfect score, and it shows like how many triple A's and how many double

1141
01:22:46,640 --> 01:22:48,860
A's you have, which I think is kind of cool. That's kind of neat.

1142
01:22:48,860 --> 01:22:51,620
I like that. That's funny. Besides that.

1143
01:22:51,620 --> 01:22:57,140
Well, anything else you want to share about the mixed jazz before I get to another call?

1144
01:22:57,140 --> 01:23:01,140
It's perfectly good to me, besides all the crap that's messed up.

1145
01:23:01,140 --> 01:23:04,420
Yeah. Alright. On the scale of one to ten?

1146
01:23:04,420 --> 01:23:07,980
Seven. Alright.

1147
01:23:07,980 --> 01:23:12,300
Take care Jazz. Thanks for calling in. Have a good one, okay? Bye. Have a nice day.

1148
01:23:12,300 --> 01:23:15,980
Later. Bye. Alright, let's go to another call.

1149
01:23:15,980 --> 01:23:18,980
We are getting hammered tonight, boys and girls. We may not get to all the calls.

1150
01:23:18,980 --> 01:23:22,980
I'm really sorry, but we're gonna try our best, okay? Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1151
01:23:22,980 --> 01:23:27,500
Hi, Sephiroth1215 here. Hi, Sephiroth1215. What's on your mind, buddy?

1152
01:23:27,500 --> 01:23:30,780
Um, just two things. First of all,

1153
01:23:30,780 --> 01:23:42,540
About UltraMix 3 really quickly, um, it's pretty good. I mean, first of all, I say I do like The Clash a lot, so I appreciate that song a lot more.

1154
01:23:42,540 --> 01:23:45,940
But is it a good DDR song?

1155
01:23:45,940 --> 01:23:48,740
Uh, it seems kinda fit. It's really catchy.

1156
01:23:48,740 --> 01:23:52,740
I guess that's just where people have difference of opinion, but okay.

1157
01:23:52,740 --> 01:23:56,740
Um, but otherwise, alright, they do have a lot of problems.

1158
01:23:56,740 --> 01:24:01,540
But the whole loading time thing, it's the same thing in the other UltraMix games.

1159
01:24:01,540 --> 01:24:03,240
It's just they don't have the loading screen.

1160
01:24:03,240 --> 01:24:06,540
Maybe that's what it is, it doesn't feel like it's so long in the other games,

1161
01:24:06,540 --> 01:24:10,240
or maybe it's because there's not as many song packs they're trying to import or something, I don't know.

1162
01:24:10,240 --> 01:24:14,740
Like, I knew in UltraMix 2 it was kind of a little bit slow, but...

1163
01:24:14,740 --> 01:24:18,740
I don't know, you just didn't feel it, it wasn't a minute long.

1164
01:24:18,740 --> 01:24:23,560
is is it seems like it's really bad at this one i mean it's just me

1165
01:24:23,560 --> 01:24:24,660
yeah and

1166
01:24:24,660 --> 01:24:25,680
quote from

1167
01:24:25,680 --> 01:24:30,180
open at twenty one is she left the bubbles

1168
01:24:30,180 --> 01:24:31,620
the bubbles act

1169
01:24:31,620 --> 01:24:33,780
i'm okay with the bubble theme but i just think

1170
01:24:33,780 --> 01:24:36,660
it could have been better like you could have been executed better

1171
01:24:36,660 --> 01:24:39,940
the bubbles but anyway this is about me this is about your thoughts all all

1172
01:24:39,940 --> 01:24:41,800
shut up

1173
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:43,640
uh...

1174
01:24:43,640 --> 01:24:47,600
but otherwise uh... i went to the m t b taping on

1175
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:49,040
tuesday

1176
01:24:49,040 --> 01:24:52,080
what it now what was this for the empty taping for white games or so whatever

1177
01:24:52,080 --> 01:24:53,520
it is they're doing

1178
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:59,120
at the game or as we could get which is really lame game orders

1179
01:24:59,120 --> 01:25:01,100
god bless m t v

1180
01:25:01,100 --> 01:25:03,060
god bless them

1181
01:25:03,060 --> 01:25:06,160
i how was it what they do what's what what can you expect on

1182
01:25:06,160 --> 01:25:10,260
on that game game orders up

1183
01:25:10,260 --> 01:25:13,720
honestly really not much

1184
01:25:13,720 --> 01:25:17,560
I was kind of psyched up at first. I was waiting on line to get in.

1185
01:25:17,560 --> 01:25:23,520
And I was in front of the line, so she's like, oh, you know, you first six or seven people,

1186
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:26,760
you come into the gaming room. So I'm like, all right, the gaming room's

1187
01:25:26,760 --> 01:25:30,360
going to be awesome. But then we get there.

1188
01:25:30,360 --> 01:25:32,440
It looks cool. They have nice TVs and everything.

1189
01:25:32,440 --> 01:25:36,840
They have a 360 set up. Like one 360?

1190
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:41,480
Yeah. Because that's all MTV got allocated in the

1191
01:25:41,480 --> 01:25:48,480
Yeah, shortage. Hey, Paris got her 360. I bet she doesn't even know what a 360 is.

1192
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:53,480
It just matches her purse, that cunt. Anyway. Anyway, sorry.

1193
01:25:53,480 --> 01:25:57,480
It was a 360 with only one controller.

1194
01:25:57,480 --> 01:26:01,480
Well, again, didn't you hear about the shortage problems?

1195
01:26:01,480 --> 01:26:05,480
Now we're going to play a 32-player deathmatch. Go.

1196
01:26:05,480 --> 01:26:08,680
It's like Mario Party 7 where it splits up the controller.

1197
01:26:08,680 --> 01:26:13,160
Okay, okay now Sephiroth1215, you get a button, and this guy over here, you get a button,

1198
01:26:13,160 --> 01:26:16,360
and you get a button, and suddenly it's like The Oprah Show,

1199
01:26:16,360 --> 01:26:20,480
and you get a button, and you get a button, and you get a button!

1200
01:26:20,480 --> 01:26:23,680
Sorry, that was really random, I'm sorry, go ahead.

1201
01:26:23,680 --> 01:26:27,280
It doesn't even matter because the batteries die in the controller anyway.

1202
01:26:27,280 --> 01:26:33,480
Good game, GG MTV, GG.

1203
01:26:33,480 --> 01:26:35,080
gg

1204
01:26:35,080 --> 01:26:36,100
and

1205
01:26:36,100 --> 01:26:37,520
they didn't

1206
01:26:37,520 --> 01:26:41,720
do much so they just gave like a fake controller and just said

1207
01:26:41,720 --> 01:26:43,080
pretend to play

1208
01:26:43,080 --> 01:26:45,880
to the person who was there

1209
01:26:45,880 --> 01:26:47,720
but wow

1210
01:26:47,720 --> 01:26:50,960
i was the one sitting there playing a stupid Frogger game

1211
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:53,320
you have to play the new Frogger game?

1212
01:26:53,320 --> 01:26:56,680
there's a Frogger game, is this on 360?

1213
01:26:56,680 --> 01:26:59,880
uh... no, the original xbox

1214
01:26:59,880 --> 01:27:00,880
Wait, what the what?

1215
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:01,880
Frog or Ancient Shadows.

1216
01:27:01,880 --> 01:27:03,160
Then what the hell is this thing all about?

1217
01:27:03,160 --> 01:27:04,160
It's not about the 360.

1218
01:27:04,160 --> 01:27:06,500
What is this show all about?

1219
01:27:06,500 --> 01:27:09,960
It's just trying to do something for gamers.

1220
01:27:09,960 --> 01:27:10,960
I don't know.

1221
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:11,960
The question everyone...

1222
01:27:11,960 --> 01:27:12,960
Do what?

1223
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:13,960
Set us back five years?

1224
01:27:13,960 --> 01:27:17,820
The question everyone wants to know is why is anyone playing Frog or Ancient Shadows?

1225
01:27:17,820 --> 01:27:18,820
That's what I want to know.

1226
01:27:18,820 --> 01:27:22,220
Yet another reason to hate Konami of Hawaii.

1227
01:27:22,220 --> 01:27:23,220
Did they do that game too?

1228
01:27:23,220 --> 01:27:25,580
Man, Hawaii lives off Frogger, dude.

1229
01:27:25,580 --> 01:27:26,580
Like nobody's business.

1230
01:27:26,580 --> 01:27:27,940
Do people buy it?

1231
01:27:27,940 --> 01:27:28,940
You know why?

1232
01:27:28,940 --> 01:27:32,700
the ten dollar ban at Walmart and people go, oh I'm gonna get Frogger for my grandson.

1233
01:27:32,700 --> 01:27:39,700
I remember Frogger. I remember Frogger. That's a hip gay, that's a bee's knees that game.

1234
01:27:39,940 --> 01:27:46,940
Anyway sorry, was Frogger the bee's knees? It was a pretty bad game but whatever I was

1235
01:27:46,940 --> 01:27:53,820
stuck playing it. But the other games were like I think Pac-Man World 3 and then Ultimate

1236
01:27:53,820 --> 01:27:58,500
Spider-Man. Oh I'm glad they threw the Ultimate Spider-Man in there, I was like did they get

1237
01:27:58,500 --> 01:28:03,500
Are they confused? Did they go off a list of what's hot, 1980 or something?

1238
01:28:03,500 --> 01:28:08,500
Somebody tell MTV that they got Pac-Man Fever.

1239
01:28:08,500 --> 01:28:10,500
Um, forget it.

1240
01:28:10,500 --> 01:28:17,500
You know Rob, I actually, um, crap, I forgot to bring you a copy of Pac-World 3.

1241
01:28:17,500 --> 01:28:19,500
It's okay, it can wait.

1242
01:28:19,500 --> 01:28:22,500
I had four of them, two of them have been returned already.

1243
01:28:22,500 --> 01:28:25,500
You know I actually was at Applebee's the other day and heard Pac-Man Fever on the radio

1244
01:28:25,500 --> 01:28:27,500
radio and I was like, I thought that song died with it.

1245
01:28:27,500 --> 01:28:29,500
Anyway, I'm sorry, we have a caller online.

1246
01:28:29,500 --> 01:28:32,500
So, are we going to see you on TV?

1247
01:28:32,500 --> 01:28:33,500
Uh, yeah.

1248
01:28:33,500 --> 01:28:37,500
Did you flash the OLR gang sign?

1249
01:28:37,500 --> 01:28:42,500
No, unfortunately, you know, we couldn't really do much, first of all.

1250
01:28:42,500 --> 01:28:46,500
But if you had an OLR shirt, I would definitely wear it.

1251
01:28:46,500 --> 01:28:48,500
I know, I keep hearing that.

1252
01:28:48,500 --> 01:28:51,500
If you only had the OLR shirt, we're working on it.

1253
01:28:51,500 --> 01:28:54,340
We just, we need, we need what's called, um, what do you call it?

1254
01:28:54,340 --> 01:28:55,460
Like a seed money.

1255
01:28:55,660 --> 01:28:58,620
We need money to buy the shirts and then we can sell them.

1256
01:28:58,660 --> 01:29:00,860
So that's what we do.

1257
01:29:00,860 --> 01:29:01,940
We do have $25.

1258
01:29:01,940 --> 01:29:02,260
That's true.

1259
01:29:02,260 --> 01:29:03,060
We want $25.

1260
01:29:03,700 --> 01:29:05,940
Anyway, anything else you want to say about the MTV taping?

1261
01:29:06,740 --> 01:29:11,980
Uh, yeah, there, there was a brief second half where it was like the actual filming

1262
01:29:11,980 --> 01:29:20,180
for the countdown they had, and we got free sports games, which in turn, I bet

1263
01:29:20,180 --> 01:29:21,300
you won't turn around and sold.

1264
01:29:21,300 --> 01:29:23,580
did they give you a key plan like

1265
01:29:23,580 --> 01:29:28,920
topspin a virtual as they have been all those games are huge in the u s

1266
01:29:28,920 --> 01:29:30,480
i'm actually the

1267
01:29:30,480 --> 01:29:35,480
dot india six and then i know that i mean oh five

1268
01:29:35,480 --> 01:29:39,420
you know i didn't know if i don't fight the i feel it now last year leading the

1269
01:29:39,420 --> 01:29:43,140
surplus on you guys before they bury them in new mexico

1270
01:29:43,140 --> 01:29:44,100
uh... wait

1271
01:29:44,100 --> 01:29:47,640
but it's all right is a family that's all right behind i don't know i have

1272
01:29:47,640 --> 01:29:53,640
It still sucks! Madden's done! I mean, give me Genesis Madden!

1273
01:29:53,640 --> 01:29:56,640
I'd have rather had Madden 05-06.

1274
01:29:56,640 --> 01:30:01,640
It's alright though, because I took them, I went down to Walmart and got full credit for it.

1275
01:30:01,640 --> 01:30:04,640
There you go! There you go, good man, good man.

1276
01:30:04,640 --> 01:30:08,640
Alright, we gotta let you go because we gotta get to other calls, but thank you for telling us what's going on.

1277
01:30:08,640 --> 01:30:11,640
Now, what are you wearing on the show so we can spot you?

1278
01:30:11,640 --> 01:30:13,640
I'm wearing a DDR Freak shirt.

1279
01:30:13,640 --> 01:30:18,640
Even though you're promoting the competition. No, I'm kidding. We love TDR Freak. That's great.

1280
01:30:18,640 --> 01:30:23,640
By the way, the show is Direct Effect.

1281
01:30:23,640 --> 01:30:25,640
Tomorrow and Tuesday.

1282
01:30:25,640 --> 01:30:27,640
Tomorrow and Tuesday. What time?

1283
01:30:27,640 --> 01:30:31,640
Over here. You know what's on a thing at seven maybe?

1284
01:30:31,640 --> 01:30:33,640
Either way, just look for Direct Effect.

1285
01:30:33,640 --> 01:30:35,640
I'll be sure to set my TiVo.

1286
01:30:35,640 --> 01:30:36,640
Alright.

1287
01:30:36,640 --> 01:30:37,640
Okay.

1288
01:30:37,640 --> 01:30:40,640
Take care, buddy. Have a good one. Thanks for calling.

1289
01:30:40,640 --> 01:30:41,640
You too. Bye.

1290
01:30:41,640 --> 01:30:42,640
Later.

1291
01:31:12,640 --> 01:31:13,660
from florida

1292
01:31:13,660 --> 01:31:15,580
uh... what's on your mind

1293
01:31:15,580 --> 01:31:17,660
uh...

1294
01:31:17,660 --> 01:31:19,860
dang this is driving me crazy

1295
01:31:19,860 --> 01:31:21,440
actually i wanted to bring up uh...

1296
01:31:21,440 --> 01:31:23,740
the guitar freaks

1297
01:31:23,740 --> 01:31:26,160
now are we talking guitar freaks or guitar hero

1298
01:31:26,160 --> 01:31:29,000
oh guitar hero sorry, what's up with guitar hero

1299
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:32,180
well actually i was trying to figure out if i should

1300
01:31:32,180 --> 01:31:35,580
save my money and go for beatmania

1301
01:31:35,580 --> 01:31:39,060
when it comes out or

1302
01:31:39,060 --> 01:31:45,000
Well, here's the way we see it, is that Guitar Hero is out now and costs, what, 70 bucks,

1303
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:46,680
I think is how much Guitar Hero costs?

1304
01:31:46,680 --> 01:31:51,360
BeatMania is out, what, the last date we heard is February 8th, I think is what we heard

1305
01:31:51,360 --> 01:31:52,360
for BeatMania?

1306
01:31:52,360 --> 01:31:53,360
February 10th.

1307
01:31:53,360 --> 01:31:56,320
February 10th or February 8th, sometime in early February is when that's coming out.

1308
01:31:56,320 --> 01:31:59,720
We don't know how much it's going to cost for sure, but let's say it's about the same,

1309
01:31:59,720 --> 01:32:00,720
$70.

1310
01:32:00,720 --> 01:32:01,720
That would seem pretty reasonable, okay?

1311
01:32:01,720 --> 01:32:02,720
Right.

1312
01:32:02,720 --> 01:32:06,320
So, the thing is, can you save $70 between now and February?

1313
01:32:06,320 --> 01:32:07,320
Probably.

1314
01:32:07,320 --> 01:32:12,620
Probably. Well then buy them both! But the thing is they keep hearing such great things about

1315
01:32:12,620 --> 01:32:16,320
Guitar Hero, I don't wanna, you know, not get it.

1316
01:32:16,320 --> 01:32:19,620
Guitar Hero is a great game, honestly. If you like

1317
01:32:19,620 --> 01:32:23,640
the guitar games at all, like, I'm gonna be honest, it's better than Guitar Freaks and the

1318
01:32:23,640 --> 01:32:25,020
reason why is because

1319
01:32:25,020 --> 01:32:29,860
it feels more like you're playing an actual guitar as opposed to holding

1320
01:32:29,860 --> 01:32:31,420
something that looks like a guitar

1321
01:32:31,420 --> 01:32:35,820
and pushing these buttons. Really, the five button thing really adds a lot to it

1322
01:32:35,820 --> 01:32:36,940
and what they do

1323
01:32:36,940 --> 01:32:40,320
is they do this thing with the fret buttons where you can actually push the

1324
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:41,280
fret buttons and

1325
01:32:41,280 --> 01:32:44,740
it's hard for me to explain, but you can push the buttons in order

1326
01:32:44,740 --> 01:32:49,120
and get the different sounds, which you couldn't do on Guitar Freaks. You had to

1327
01:32:49,120 --> 01:32:52,040
be holding the exact right button combinations if the damn thing didn't work.

1328
01:32:52,040 --> 01:32:56,340
And, you know, they did an awesome job in the art direction department. Let's

1329
01:32:56,340 --> 01:32:57,960
face it, Guitar Freaks was cool

1330
01:32:57,960 --> 01:33:01,700
for about the first 75 mixes, but now that they're on, you know, whatever they're on

1331
01:33:01,700 --> 01:33:01,960
like

1332
01:33:01,960 --> 01:33:05,480
Guitar Freaks super duper second mix, whatever they're on,

1333
01:33:05,480 --> 01:33:10,360
V2. I don't even...V2, thank you. Okay, whatever the hell they're on. It's the same damn game.

1334
01:33:10,360 --> 01:33:14,360
Nothing has been changed, and it's the same damn interface. Even though they went up to

1335
01:33:14,360 --> 01:33:20,000
PlayStation 2, it's the same thing, except the videos are now full motion videos. Whoopie

1336
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:24,100
doo! I don't watch the videos when I play the game, okay? That's why I think Guitar

1337
01:33:24,100 --> 01:33:28,860
Hero got it a little bit better. And plus, here's the other big thing though. If you

1338
01:33:28,860 --> 01:33:35,320
like songs, if you like the J-Pop, Happy, Go Lucky, Ya Ya Ya songs, then Guitar Freaks

1339
01:33:35,320 --> 01:33:40,820
is going to be the better game because Guitar Hero is filled with good old fashioned American

1340
01:33:40,820 --> 01:33:46,060
butt rock is what's in Guitar Hero. And so if you like the butt rock, you're going to

1341
01:33:46,060 --> 01:33:49,380
like this game. When I say butt rock, I mean like, you know, Pantera.

1342
01:33:49,380 --> 01:33:53,520
If I don't like that kind of rock, then look. Then you're not going to like Guitar Hero.

1343
01:33:53,520 --> 01:33:54,960
You're not going to like the song list. Okay.

1344
01:33:54,960 --> 01:33:58,400
So maybe that answers your question right there. There are a couple... I'm not a huge

1345
01:33:58,400 --> 01:34:02,640
fan of butt rock, but there are kind of a cool few songs here and there like I Like

1346
01:34:02,640 --> 01:34:07,520
rock and roll, Ziggy Stardust, you know, those songs are cool. And then I think it was really

1347
01:34:07,520 --> 01:34:12,240
neat that they put a bunch of unknown bands as the 17, I think it's what, 17 unlocked

1348
01:34:12,240 --> 01:34:17,040
songs? That's kind of neat. But, yeah, Freezepop, awesome. But, you know, let's face it, the

1349
01:34:17,040 --> 01:34:23,280
majority of the song list is good old-fashioned hardcore butt rock. So, I don't know, if that's

1350
01:34:23,280 --> 01:34:25,240
not- Right, but it's just people saying wonderful

1351
01:34:25,240 --> 01:34:28,560
things about the song list, and I'm like, well, you know, what if I don't like that

1352
01:34:28,560 --> 01:34:30,880
style of music? Then you're not going to like Guitar Hero.

1353
01:34:30,880 --> 01:34:33,200
And it's pretty easy to find the song list.

1354
01:34:33,200 --> 01:34:36,000
If you go to GuitarHeroGame.com, that's the website.

1355
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:39,400
They got a song list right on the website, so it's not hard to find it.

1356
01:34:39,400 --> 01:34:43,400
But if you are into the Japanese, like, if you like trance and stuff, BeatMania, hell,

1357
01:34:43,400 --> 01:34:46,640
BeatMania is, I don't, we don't know what songs for sure are going to be BeatMania.

1358
01:34:46,640 --> 01:34:50,400
I mean, we know a few here and there, but rest assured, if it's like any of the other

1359
01:34:50,400 --> 01:34:55,780
past what, 1,500 mixes they've had in Japan, you're going to have your happy trance and

1360
01:34:55,780 --> 01:35:00,120
some J-pop, and if that's the kind of music you're into, BeatMania is where it's at.

1361
01:35:00,120 --> 01:35:01,120
Okay.

1362
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:02,120
All right.

1363
01:35:02,120 --> 01:35:03,120
Have fun.

1364
01:35:03,120 --> 01:35:04,120
Yeah.

1365
01:35:04,120 --> 01:35:05,120
You too.

1366
01:35:05,120 --> 01:35:08,120
Keep supporting them music games because starving programmers need your money.

1367
01:35:08,120 --> 01:35:09,120
Okay?

1368
01:35:09,120 --> 01:35:10,120
Yeah.

1369
01:35:10,120 --> 01:35:11,120
Rockstar's getting it.

1370
01:35:11,120 --> 01:35:12,120
All right.

1371
01:35:12,120 --> 01:35:13,120
Well, wait.

1372
01:35:13,120 --> 01:35:14,120
No, no, no, no.

1373
01:35:14,120 --> 01:35:15,120
Oh, wait.

1374
01:35:15,120 --> 01:35:16,120
Rockstar?

1375
01:35:16,120 --> 01:35:17,120
Oh, for In the Groove?

1376
01:35:17,120 --> 01:35:18,120
Yeah.

1377
01:35:18,120 --> 01:35:19,120
Oh, that's a whole other thing, man.

1378
01:35:19,120 --> 01:35:20,120
That's a whole other topic.

1379
01:35:20,120 --> 01:35:21,120
I know.

1380
01:35:21,120 --> 01:35:22,120
I brought it up like a month ago.

1381
01:35:22,120 --> 01:35:23,120
I know.

1382
01:35:23,120 --> 01:35:24,120
You think I remember each of these shows, please.

1383
01:35:24,120 --> 01:35:25,120
With all the drugs I do.

1384
01:35:25,120 --> 01:35:26,120
Come on.

1385
01:35:26,120 --> 01:35:27,120
Just kidding.

1386
01:35:27,120 --> 01:35:28,120
Just kidding, kids.

1387
01:35:28,120 --> 01:35:29,120
Don't do drugs.

1388
01:35:29,120 --> 01:35:31,120
Okay. Alright, have a good one.

1389
01:35:31,120 --> 01:35:33,120
You too. Later!

1390
01:35:33,120 --> 01:35:35,120
Rockstar sucks. No, I'm kidding.

1391
01:35:35,120 --> 01:35:37,120
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1392
01:35:37,120 --> 01:35:39,120
I just had to drop that. No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

1393
01:35:39,120 --> 01:35:41,120
I just wanted to make somebody angry.

1394
01:35:41,120 --> 01:35:43,120
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1395
01:35:43,120 --> 01:35:47,120
You know, in the groove is okay.

1396
01:35:47,120 --> 01:35:50,120
I'd like to mention I said nothing.

1397
01:35:50,120 --> 01:35:52,120
You are a good boy. You are a very good boy, Loki.

1398
01:35:52,120 --> 01:35:53,120
No, no, no.

1399
01:35:53,120 --> 01:35:56,120
Keep playing Mario Kart. It's keeping you quiet over there.

1400
01:35:56,120 --> 01:36:01,120
I've got almost all the races beat in 150cc.

1401
01:36:01,120 --> 01:36:08,120
Actually, I have to say I'm strangely looking forward to In The Group 2 on a home console.

1402
01:36:08,120 --> 01:36:14,120
I think if they fix a lot of things, I don't know. It might be neat. We'll see.

1403
01:36:14,120 --> 01:36:16,120
It'd be neat when they get sued.

1404
01:36:16,120 --> 01:36:21,120
Oh, stop it. Let's go to another call. Let's go to this one.

1405
01:36:21,120 --> 01:36:23,120
Hi, you're on Orange Long Radio.

1406
01:36:23,120 --> 01:36:27,720
Hey Sky speaker here. Hello. Oh, it's our resident 2dx whore. How are you doing?

1407
01:36:28,240 --> 01:36:31,900
Don't you mean 2dx bastard? Oh, that's right. You're a 2dx bastard. Not a whore. I'm sorry

1408
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:38,500
Whores imply you're getting paid. Um, which you're not you're actually spending a lot of money that makes you

1409
01:36:38,500 --> 01:36:42,580
I don't know what that makes you but what's on your mind? Well as of last Tuesday

1410
01:36:42,580 --> 01:36:46,040
I finally got my copy of beat me 2dx tent style. Whoo

1411
01:36:47,400 --> 01:36:48,760
How is it?

1412
01:36:48,760 --> 01:36:57,760
It's really great. As a matter of fact, I would like to give my input on those 7TS exclusives.

1413
01:36:57,760 --> 01:36:59,760
Go for it.

1414
01:36:59,760 --> 01:37:05,760
First up is Taito no Suika by Burma Inazawa featuring Shimotsuki Haruka.

1415
01:37:05,760 --> 01:37:14,760
On a scale of level 1 to level 12, which to level 12 is the most difficult, I would give it a level 10.

1416
01:37:14,760 --> 01:37:18,680
okay I'm next up is a you know jellyhead

1417
01:37:18,680 --> 01:37:21,600
a jelly kiss a mediate smack mix I'm

1418
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:25,280
I'm on seven key it stays as it is as level seven

1419
01:37:25,280 --> 01:37:28,560
on the another I would give it a a level 10

1420
01:37:28,560 --> 01:37:32,420
pretty hard I'm pretty hard what do you want to think about to clear it

1421
01:37:32,420 --> 01:37:34,640
I have to ask you what do you think about that anyway because you're you're

1422
01:37:34,640 --> 01:37:37,400
pretty loyal to all the Japanese mixes that come out what do you think about

1423
01:37:37,400 --> 01:37:38,240
that US

1424
01:37:38,240 --> 01:37:41,520
get like a US on crossing over in Japan what do you think about that

1425
01:37:41,520 --> 01:37:43,520
I was quite surprised, actually.

1426
01:37:43,520 --> 01:37:48,520
Yeah, I was surprised, too, but we actually have an interview with Minniehead in this week's podcast.

1427
01:37:48,520 --> 01:37:51,520
It's pretty interesting because I kind of asked him right about this, too.

1428
01:37:51,520 --> 01:37:54,520
So, you'll have to tune in to hear what he has to say, so it's kind of neat.

1429
01:37:54,520 --> 01:37:55,520
Anyway, go ahead.

1430
01:37:55,520 --> 01:37:58,520
Let's see, Hype the Core.

1431
01:37:58,520 --> 01:38:03,520
I would, you know, on seven key, I would give it a level nine.

1432
01:38:03,520 --> 01:38:06,520
On the another, it should be a level twelve.

1433
01:38:06,520 --> 01:38:08,520
It's really the hardest one.

1434
01:38:08,520 --> 01:38:09,520
Wow.

1435
01:38:09,520 --> 01:38:22,520
Xian, yeah, I did a Tatsujin video on that. You know, what's really weird is it doesn't really look like a level 8. I should really give it a level 7.

1436
01:38:22,520 --> 01:38:23,520
Really?

1437
01:38:23,520 --> 01:38:24,520
Yeah.

1438
01:38:24,520 --> 01:38:28,520
I like hearing that though because that means it'll be a hard song I can beat.

1439
01:38:28,520 --> 01:38:33,520
And on the another, I give it a level 8 as it is.

1440
01:38:33,520 --> 01:38:34,520
Okay.

1441
01:38:34,520 --> 01:38:40,520
Um, let's see, what else? Uh, Satellite 020712 from Coded Arms.

1442
01:38:40,520 --> 01:38:47,520
Um, it's level 8, it stays as it is on 7 key. On the another, I give it a level 11.

1443
01:38:47,520 --> 01:38:48,520
That's awesome.

1444
01:38:48,520 --> 01:38:50,520
Yeah, you didn't know they had Coded Arms in there?

1445
01:38:50,520 --> 01:38:51,520
No, I didn't.

1446
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:52,520
No, you had to turn on the mic.

1447
01:38:52,520 --> 01:38:53,520
I turned off the mic.

1448
01:38:53,520 --> 01:38:59,520
I didn't realize they had that. No, what they needed was um, I wanna say it was Radar Rider, something like that, or um...

1449
01:38:59,520 --> 01:39:02,520
Yeah, they're crossing over from their other franchises.

1450
01:39:02,520 --> 01:39:03,520
Good stuff.

1451
01:39:03,520 --> 01:39:09,760
Humble Roses music in Ultra Mix 3. That's good. Interesting. Anyway, go ahead.

1452
01:39:09,760 --> 01:39:17,200
Let me check my 10th style here and give my personal opinion on the 76 exclusives. How

1453
01:39:17,200 --> 01:39:19,520
many CS exclusives have I already mentioned so far?

1454
01:39:19,520 --> 01:39:23,520
8, 10, or like 4 or 5.

1455
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:26,520
I don't know. Suica and Satalago20712.

1456
01:39:26,520 --> 01:39:28,520
I think you're missing Strong Woman and...

1457
01:39:28,520 --> 01:39:42,520
Oh yeah. On the another, I give it a level 8 because of the chords. Even though it's 95 bpm, which is really, really slow, I had a rough time.

1458
01:39:42,520 --> 01:39:44,520
Sounds a little bit like War Game.

1459
01:39:44,520 --> 01:39:45,520
Yeah.

1460
01:39:45,520 --> 01:39:46,520
A little bit. Okay.

1461
01:39:46,520 --> 01:39:56,520
A little bit. And I think the last one, hmm. What was it again? Oh, Acid Vision. Here we go. Oh, very, very good song.

1462
01:39:56,520 --> 01:40:02,520
Level 8 stays as it is on 7 key and on the another, I give it a level 10.

1463
01:40:02,520 --> 01:40:05,520
All right. What are your thoughts about 10 style overall?

1464
01:40:05,520 --> 01:40:16,520
Oh, it's really, really good. They just put in a judge mode in which you can see how many perfect grades and grades that you have.

1465
01:40:16,520 --> 01:40:25,520
What else? They have the end of the DG point. And yeah, Sakurina, one more lovely ownage.

1466
01:40:25,520 --> 01:40:30,620
All right. Any other words for our listeners before we let you go? We've got to get to

1467
01:40:30,620 --> 01:40:31,620
another call.

1468
01:40:31,620 --> 01:40:36,720
Well, I just want to say, ah, go get 10 style.

1469
01:40:36,720 --> 01:40:41,880
All right. I actually plan on getting it as soon as I get a new controller, which will

1470
01:40:41,880 --> 01:40:46,320
be very soon, because I've heard the rumors that Konami is putting out a new one for the

1471
01:40:46,320 --> 01:40:50,200
U.S., as I'm sure we all have, but we'll see. And if it's true, I'm definitely getting one.

1472
01:40:50,200 --> 01:40:51,200
So we'll see.

1473
01:40:51,200 --> 01:41:00,200
Go watch my Tatsujin videos, Desolation & Other, Don't Forget & Other, and the Exe & Seventy that I did.

1474
01:41:00,200 --> 01:41:01,200
Put a link in the chatroom.

1475
01:41:01,200 --> 01:41:08,200
I'll post it online, the site that has the Tatsujin videos that I have.

1476
01:41:08,200 --> 01:41:10,200
Absolutely, put a link in our chatroom.

1477
01:41:10,200 --> 01:41:13,200
Alright, take care buddy.

1478
01:41:13,200 --> 01:41:14,200
Alright, later.

1479
01:41:14,200 --> 01:41:15,200
Later.

1480
01:41:15,200 --> 01:41:16,760
One more call, you guys.

1481
01:41:16,760 --> 01:41:18,320
And we're getting hammered tonight.

1482
01:41:18,320 --> 01:41:20,240
So if we don't get to your call, I'm really sorry.

1483
01:41:20,240 --> 01:41:21,800
We're almost out of time.

1484
01:41:21,800 --> 01:41:24,800
We'll try to get more calls in a little later during the show.

1485
01:41:24,800 --> 01:41:26,400
However, we're going to do one more.

1486
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:30,280
Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1487
01:41:30,280 --> 01:41:30,960
Hi.

1488
01:41:30,960 --> 01:41:31,440
Hi.

1489
01:41:31,440 --> 01:41:33,080
Who's this?

1490
01:41:33,080 --> 01:41:33,880
This is Roz.

1491
01:41:33,880 --> 01:41:34,640
Hi, Roz.

1492
01:41:34,640 --> 01:41:35,320
How are you?

1493
01:41:40,320 --> 01:41:42,640
That sounds a little iffy to me.

1494
01:41:42,640 --> 01:41:45,640
Yeah, I had an interesting weekend.

1495
01:41:45,640 --> 01:41:48,640
Okay, do tell. What happened on your interesting weekend?

1496
01:41:48,640 --> 01:41:55,640
Okay, well, my dad has been in Mexico all week, and he just got back on Friday night.

1497
01:41:55,640 --> 01:41:56,640
Okay.

1498
01:41:56,640 --> 01:42:03,640
And, as some of you may know, I was in a school play on Friday and Saturday evening.

1499
01:42:03,640 --> 01:42:05,640
Okay.

1500
01:42:05,640 --> 01:42:12,640
Well, he gets back Friday night after the play. Missed the first night. That's alright. I figure you could be the next night.

1501
01:42:15,640 --> 01:42:24,640
Saturday morning, I wake up. I apparently had some kind of horrible allergic reaction to the makeup that they used on my face.

1502
01:42:24,640 --> 01:42:26,640
Oh, no!

1503
01:42:26,640 --> 01:42:32,640
So, I looked and felt sunburnt the whole day, and still do.

1504
01:42:32,640 --> 01:42:36,920
And that wasn't something that they found out before the play went, like you guys didn't

1505
01:42:36,920 --> 01:42:39,800
do like a full-on dress rehearsal or anything or?

1506
01:42:39,800 --> 01:42:40,800
No.

1507
01:42:40,800 --> 01:42:41,800
No.

1508
01:42:41,800 --> 01:42:42,800
Definitely.

1509
01:42:42,800 --> 01:42:45,240
We didn't do a dress rehearsal.

1510
01:42:45,240 --> 01:42:47,520
We just kind of went into it right off.

1511
01:42:47,520 --> 01:42:48,520
Oh no.

1512
01:42:48,520 --> 01:42:49,520
Okay.

1513
01:42:49,520 --> 01:42:52,400
So I looked angry.

1514
01:42:52,400 --> 01:42:56,960
So did you end up doing the play on Saturday anyway?

1515
01:42:56,960 --> 01:42:58,120
Yeah.

1516
01:42:58,120 --> 01:43:07,260
On Saturday, um, I left for the play, you know, went there, um, and the play actually

1517
01:43:07,260 --> 01:43:08,260
went great.

1518
01:43:08,260 --> 01:43:12,780
So, that was good, you know, my dad didn't go the second night because he was sick, and

1519
01:43:12,780 --> 01:43:15,180
I didn't realize how sick he was.

1520
01:43:15,180 --> 01:43:16,180
Uh oh.

1521
01:43:16,180 --> 01:43:19,820
Yeah, I'm going to say, I think he drank the water.

1522
01:43:19,820 --> 01:43:23,420
Oh no, in Mexico.

1523
01:43:23,420 --> 01:43:25,420
Yeah, um

1524
01:43:25,420 --> 01:43:32,740
So I was at the cast party, which was half-assed because there were only like four people at the party

1525
01:43:33,420 --> 01:43:39,460
and we're talking, you know, we're talking about getting flowers from our parents and I'm like, yeah, I didn't get any and

1526
01:43:40,640 --> 01:43:42,900
My sister leads me off to the side

1527
01:43:43,880 --> 01:43:45,420
She's like

1528
01:43:45,420 --> 01:43:47,420
Here's why we didn't get you flowers

1529
01:43:47,420 --> 01:43:55,360
because we found dad laying on the bathroom floor and this is starting to

1530
01:43:55,360 --> 01:43:58,760
sound more and more like an early fu of the week in a way like this whole thing

1531
01:43:58,760 --> 01:44:04,340
is just like and oh my gosh I'd be so pissed yeah I was pretty pissed off

1532
01:44:04,340 --> 01:44:08,400

1546
01:45:19,800 --> 01:45:23,040
want to bring Dark Sakura back at some point as well but we're running behind

1547
01:45:23,040 --> 01:45:26,800
on our other stuff and the stuff we've got to get to this week and of course

1548
01:45:26,800 --> 01:45:30,760
you know it just wouldn't be a show if we didn't have ourselves a little bit of

1549
01:45:30,760 --> 01:45:32,760
of a cage match.

1550
01:46:00,760 --> 01:46:09,200
The song is called Precious and it's our winner.

1551
01:46:09,200 --> 01:46:13,280
Remember the way the Cage Match works is that we play three songs for you guys.

1552
01:46:13,280 --> 01:46:17,760
We play a clip of the previous winner and two new songs in full for you guys.

1553
01:46:17,760 --> 01:46:21,240
You guys vote for your favorite in our chatroom at orangebonnetradio.com and that winner goes

1554
01:46:21,240 --> 01:46:26,160
in a rotation all week long on Orange Bonnet Radio's video game music and more program.

1555
01:46:26,160 --> 01:46:27,160
Here it is!

1556
01:46:27,160 --> 01:46:28,360
Song number one tonight in the Cage Match.

1557
01:46:28,360 --> 01:46:35,360
a clip of Precious by Depeche Mode.

1558
01:46:58,360 --> 01:47:08,360
Things get damaged, things get broken I thought we'd manage, but what that does for me

1559
01:47:08,360 --> 01:47:14,360
Left on the Britain, there was no Britain left to do

1560
01:47:14,360 --> 01:47:40,200
Angels with silver wings Should have no suffering

1561
01:47:40,200 --> 01:47:44,200
I wish I could take the pain for you

1562
01:47:49,200 --> 01:47:52,200
If God has a master plan

1563
01:47:53,200 --> 01:47:57,200
That only He understands

1564
01:47:58,200 --> 01:48:01,200
I hope that your eyes are seeing

1565
01:48:01,200 --> 01:48:19,200
Things get damaged, things get broken I thought we'd vanish, but words left unspoken Left us so pretty

1566
01:48:19,200 --> 01:48:22,200
There was a little left to you

1567
01:48:22,200 --> 01:48:33,160
Okay, that was song number one in tonight's cage match, Depeche Mode with Precious.

1568
01:48:33,160 --> 01:48:35,200
Alright, we're going to get into song number two now.

1569
01:48:35,200 --> 01:48:38,840
This is actually Darkstalker's pick and unfortunately she's unable to call us back right now and

1570
01:48:38,840 --> 01:48:42,960
intro it herself, but from what we understand, it sounds like Roz has something to do with

1571
01:48:42,960 --> 01:48:47,720
this pick, so maybe she's doing that trick that I did last month when I had Miklotov

1572
01:48:47,720 --> 01:48:52,040
pick one of my songs and it went all the way to retirement, so we'll see.

1573
01:48:52,040 --> 01:48:56,800
dark soccer have the same watch we'll see song number two is Cali Hall by

1574
01:48:56,800 --> 01:49:00,320
banana man enjoy

1575
01:49:04,600 --> 01:49:13,960
do you see banana man hopping over on the white arts and they come with some

1576
01:49:13,960 --> 01:49:23,680
for me? Freshly taken from banana tree. Banana man me, want it done. Give me double and a

1577
01:49:23,680 --> 01:49:32,920
bonus one. Give me more for all me friends. This banana flow will never end. Do you want

1578
01:49:32,920 --> 01:49:43,920
a banana? Peel it down and go mmm mmm mmm. Do you want a banana? This banana for you.

1579
01:49:43,920 --> 01:49:50,920
Tonight we dance around the flame Then we get to play the spirit game

1580
01:49:50,920 --> 01:49:57,920
Spirit names we shout out loud Shake the thunder from the spirit cloud

1581
01:49:57,920 --> 01:50:03,920
All the songbirds in the tree Chant a tune to let the spirits free

1582
01:50:03,920 --> 01:50:10,920
Then we see them in the night Spirit's dropping by the firelight

1583
01:50:10,920 --> 01:50:13,920
Do you want a banana?

1584
01:50:13,920 --> 01:50:16,920
Feel it down low

1585
01:50:17,920 --> 01:50:20,920
Do you want a banana?

1586
01:50:20,920 --> 01:50:23,920
This banana for you

1587
01:50:28,920 --> 01:50:30,920
Look you, you're too uptight you know

1588
01:50:30,920 --> 01:50:32,920
You could laugh and kick it back and go

1589
01:50:32,920 --> 01:50:34,920
But without a rhythm or a rhyme

1590
01:50:34,920 --> 01:50:37,920
You do not banana all the time

1591
01:50:37,920 --> 01:50:39,920
Fly away from city on the run

1592
01:50:39,920 --> 01:50:41,920
Tried to make a little fun

1593
01:50:46,920 --> 01:50:48,920
Look, you come to me from below

1594
01:50:48,920 --> 01:50:50,920
Happy times, you tell me, don't you so

1595
01:50:50,920 --> 01:50:52,920
Don't you love me, bumping up your tongue

1596
01:50:52,920 --> 01:50:54,920
Make a shame until we bumble

1597
01:50:54,920 --> 01:50:56,920
I mean, there's even no play until you drop

1598
01:50:56,920 --> 01:50:58,920
At least when I run, never stop

1599
01:51:03,920 --> 01:51:05,920
Forget all your troubles and goatee flow

1600
01:51:05,920 --> 01:51:07,920
Forget about whatever you may never know

1601
01:51:07,920 --> 01:51:10,120
Like whether whatever you're doing is whatever you should

1602
01:51:10,120 --> 01:51:11,920
And whether anything you feel is ever anything

1603
01:51:11,920 --> 01:51:13,520
But wouldn't that forget about banana

1604
01:51:13,520 --> 01:51:14,520
When they stick in your throat

1605
01:51:14,520 --> 01:51:15,720
And when they make you want a bell

1606
01:51:15,720 --> 01:51:16,720
Or when you're stuck in a choke

1607
01:51:16,720 --> 01:51:18,920
And you forget about the yellow from the colorful man

1608
01:51:18,920 --> 01:51:19,920
And if you take another one

1609
01:51:19,920 --> 01:51:21,920
Then make a mark on your old land

1610
01:51:28,120 --> 01:51:30,120
Fungalay, Fungalow

1611
01:51:30,120 --> 01:51:48,880
Well, it's nine o'clock and it's getting dark And the sun is falling from the sky

1612
01:51:48,880 --> 01:51:55,880
I've never left so early and you may wonder why

1613
01:52:18,880 --> 01:52:36,000
Tomorrow morning on this plane No banana make you go insane

1614
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:42,640
Lookin' back to Busytown, no banana make you want to frown

1615
01:52:42,640 --> 01:52:49,280
Do you want a banana? Feel it now, oh

1616
01:52:49,280 --> 01:52:58,880
Do you want a banana? Eat banana for...

1617
01:52:58,880 --> 01:53:02,880
you

1618
01:53:22,880 --> 01:53:27,880
Song number two in tonight's stage match

1619
01:53:27,880 --> 01:53:34,880
Tallyhowl with the Banana Man. Let's go around and see if that song is banana-rific or if it's just plain rotten.

1620
01:53:34,880 --> 01:53:35,880
Angel.

1621
01:53:35,880 --> 01:53:39,880
I was the only one that started giggling when it started playing. I was like, oh my god!

1622
01:53:39,880 --> 01:53:40,880
Did you know it was in the video, apparently?

1623
01:53:40,880 --> 01:53:41,880
Of course.

1624
01:53:41,880 --> 01:53:42,880
What did you think?

1625
01:53:42,880 --> 01:53:46,880
Um, yeah, the cat room is right here. It's in the video.

1626
01:53:46,880 --> 01:53:47,880
Okay.

1627
01:53:47,880 --> 01:53:54,880
But, um, I just didn't think it said just because it's funny, but, oh, what the hell. I'll give it a 10.

1628
01:53:54,880 --> 01:53:57,880
Alright, ten from Angel.

1629
01:53:57,880 --> 01:54:03,880
I'm gonna kind of agree that there's something there where apparently I'm not getting something because I haven't seen the video.

1630
01:54:03,880 --> 01:54:08,880
But I'll take a leap of faith there. I don't know so much about the cage match, though. It's not...

1631
01:54:08,880 --> 01:54:13,880
It seems like more of the thing that would have been unfortunate. But I don't know. Whatever. It was okay.

1632
01:54:13,880 --> 01:54:16,880
I give it an okay score of a seven.

1633
01:54:16,880 --> 01:54:18,880
Melody!

1634
01:54:18,880 --> 01:54:23,880
I, I, I, I just don't get it.

1635
01:54:23,880 --> 01:54:27,880
Okay, okay, I'll post the video in my live journal so everyone can get it.

1636
01:54:27,880 --> 01:54:29,880
Of course it doesn't!

1637
01:54:29,880 --> 01:54:31,880
For later!

1638
01:54:31,880 --> 01:54:33,880
I give it an F.

1639
01:54:33,880 --> 01:54:35,880
No.

1640
01:54:35,880 --> 01:54:37,880
Um, if when some money could stay a thing, she would say,

1641
01:54:37,880 --> 01:54:39,880
that banana was shit.

1642
01:54:39,880 --> 01:54:42,880
I give it a one.

1643
01:54:42,880 --> 01:54:44,880
Loki.

1644
01:54:44,880 --> 01:54:47,880
I'm sorry, but the cage match does not require video,

1645
01:54:47,880 --> 01:54:52,880
So, based on the song alone, it sucked balls, and it gets a one.

1646
01:54:52,880 --> 01:54:54,880
Alright.

1647
01:54:54,880 --> 01:55:00,880
And, uh, DarkSakura is actually in chat right now, she's yelling at me, she gives it a score of 11-T.

1648
01:55:00,880 --> 01:55:02,880
And it says, Ba-na-na.

1649
01:55:02,880 --> 01:55:06,880
Unfortunately, 11-T is not a number, therefore it's zero.

1650
01:55:06,880 --> 01:55:07,880
Stop.

1651
01:55:07,880 --> 01:55:09,880
Alright.

1652
01:55:09,880 --> 01:55:13,880
Um, moving on. Song number three in tonight's cage match.

1653
01:55:13,880 --> 01:55:15,880
Uh, Loki, what the hell did you bring to the table today?

1654
01:55:15,880 --> 01:55:21,880
I don't remember if I put this in the cage match or not, but this song sounds like a good song that would be for a guitar hero.

1655
01:55:21,880 --> 01:55:29,880
It's like a kickass song. It features a guitarist by the name of John Sykes who is also in Whitesnake and some other bands.

1656
01:55:29,880 --> 01:55:35,880
This is actually a theme song to an anime. Whitesnake sounds awesome to me. It's badass.

1657
01:55:35,880 --> 01:55:38,880
John Sykes with cautionary warning.

1658
01:55:38,880 --> 01:55:39,880
Yes, here it is.

1659
01:55:39,880 --> 01:55:41,880
Ed Short. Enjoy, kids.

1660
01:56:09,880 --> 01:56:12,880
I'm gonna shoot every wall that I put through

1661
01:56:22,880 --> 01:56:24,880
Mr. Boy, you were put in good form with the line

1662
01:56:24,880 --> 01:56:26,880
So he told me the dark of old is time

1663
01:56:26,880 --> 01:56:28,880
Now only time will tell

1664
01:56:28,880 --> 01:56:31,880
Will he take you down or will you pull through?

1665
01:56:31,880 --> 01:56:34,880
The tiger boy has put the burden in fire but now he's dead

1666
01:56:34,880 --> 01:56:36,880
Now you're falling for the test

1667
01:56:36,880 --> 01:56:37,880
Now only time will tell

1668
01:57:07,880 --> 01:57:35,880
You are my excavator, you are my excavator You are my place to break up, so I shall never

1669
01:58:05,880 --> 01:58:08,380
Like a voice in the darkness of the night

1670
01:58:08,380 --> 01:58:10,880
Telling tales that become what you describe

1671
01:58:10,880 --> 01:58:12,380
Cause only the time will tell

1672
01:58:12,380 --> 01:58:13,880
Will you take me down?

1673
01:58:13,880 --> 01:58:15,380
How?

1674
01:58:15,380 --> 01:58:17,380
You are my indicator

1675
01:58:17,380 --> 01:58:19,380
You are my incubator

1676
01:58:19,380 --> 01:58:21,380
You are my space invader

1677
01:58:21,380 --> 01:58:23,380
You are your every warning

1678
01:58:23,380 --> 01:58:24,380
I will prove

1679
01:58:24,380 --> 01:58:13,280
You are my

1680
01:58:26,380 --> 01:58:27,380
You are my

1681
01:58:28,880 --> 01:58:29,880
You are my

1682
01:58:30,880 --> 01:58:32,380
You are your every warning

1683
01:58:32,380 --> 01:58:33,380
I will prove

1684
01:58:33,380 --> 01:58:35,380
Talking about the eyes of danger

1685
01:58:35,380 --> 01:58:37,380
Time to beat your back with action

1686
01:58:37,380 --> 01:58:39,380
Voices out my head

1687
01:58:39,380 --> 01:58:41,380
Don't you think you'll stay

1688
01:58:41,380 --> 01:58:43,380
Well, I bet you'll be to the act

1689
01:58:43,380 --> 01:58:45,380
But I just don't want to recognize

1690
01:58:45,380 --> 01:58:47,380
You just don't want to tell

1691
01:58:47,380 --> 01:58:48,380
No one's in question

1692
01:58:48,380 --> 01:58:50,380
No one's in question once again

1693
01:58:50,380 --> 01:58:52,380
But I don't know what's the mental fact

1694
01:58:52,380 --> 01:58:55,380
And no one knows just where or what they're at

1695
01:58:55,380 --> 01:58:57,380
And anytime of the day

1696
01:58:57,380 --> 01:58:59,380
No one left to say

1697
01:58:59,380 --> 01:59:16,380
Song number three is John Sykes with Cautionary Warning. Let's go around and see what everybody

1698
01:59:16,380 --> 01:59:18,380
thought of that one. Uh, Angel?

1699
01:59:18,380 --> 01:59:26,380
Uh, it was good. Um, eight and a half.

1700
01:59:26,380 --> 01:59:30,380
There was no White Snake, that's for damn sure. Five. Melody.

1701
01:59:30,380 --> 01:59:35,380
That was freakin' cool, and now I wanna go play Guitar Hero. Uh, nine.

1702
01:59:35,380 --> 01:59:36,380
No.

1703
01:59:38,380 --> 01:59:39,380
I got my voice cracked, I'm going with a few beats.

1704
01:59:39,380 --> 01:59:42,380
Definitely, you know, got like the ass-kicking 80's, you know, vibe to it.

1705
01:59:42,380 --> 01:59:47,380
You know, I was just waiting for Jean-Claude Van Damme to like beat someone's ass or something, but...

1706
01:59:47,380 --> 01:59:51,380
Yeah, overall it was pretty cool, I give it a... I give it an 8.7.

1707
01:59:51,380 --> 01:59:52,380
Uh, Loki.

1708
01:59:52,380 --> 01:59:58,380
It's badass. It's ten. It's gonna be really friggin' hard in like any guitar game.

1709
01:59:58,380 --> 01:59:59,380
Alright.

1710
01:59:59,380 --> 02:00:04,380
DarkSakura says, uh, you get an automatic zero for being rude earlier.

1711
02:00:04,380 --> 02:00:06,380
Oh!

1712
02:00:06,380 --> 02:00:08,380
Got big crappy songs then.

1713
02:00:08,380 --> 02:00:11,380
Oh snap. Oh snap.

1714
02:00:11,380 --> 02:00:15,380
I gave her song a higher score than I gave your song. That was not why.

1715
02:00:15,380 --> 02:00:21,380
You misrepresented that song by making me think it would be like Whitesnake.

1716
02:00:21,380 --> 02:00:23,380
I said he was in YSING! I didn't say he was in YSING!

1717
02:00:23,380 --> 02:00:25,380
It was misrepresenting!

1718
02:00:25,380 --> 02:00:27,380
It was misrepresenting! I demand a free trial.

1719
02:00:27,380 --> 02:00:29,380
Alright.

1720
02:00:29,380 --> 02:00:33,380
Let's recap the three songs you can vote for tonight, shall we?

1721
02:00:33,380 --> 02:00:37,380
We'll start off with song number one that you can vote for tonight is...

1722
02:00:37,380 --> 02:00:43,380
Depeche Mode with Precious, if I can find it in my list here.

1723
02:00:43,380 --> 02:00:45,380
That was a really good song on that CD too.

1724
02:00:45,380 --> 02:00:49,380
That worries me that I cannot suddenly find Depeche Mode with Precious. Here we go!

1725
02:00:49,380 --> 02:00:56,380
Let's try this again. Song number one was Precious by Depeche Mode.

1726
02:00:58,800 --> 02:01:03,560
Alright, song number two you can vote for tonight is Tally Hall with

1727
02:01:03,560 --> 02:01:10,560
Banana Man.

1728
02:01:10,560 --> 02:01:19,120
And song number three you can vote for tonight is John Sykes with Cautionary Warning.

1729
02:01:19,120 --> 02:01:31,160
All right kids, place, vote now, send a private message to Sky with your vote for song number

1730
02:01:31,160 --> 02:01:34,760
one, song number two, or if you're so inclined, song number three.

1731
02:01:34,760 --> 02:01:35,760
It's your choice.

1732
02:01:35,760 --> 02:01:36,760
Send a vote in right now.

1733
02:01:36,760 --> 02:01:37,760
Private message to Sky.

1734
02:01:37,760 --> 02:01:38,760
Do it!

1735
02:01:38,760 --> 02:01:39,760
All right.

1736
02:01:39,760 --> 02:01:45,760
Meanwhile, let's go over to Loki real quick. What is going on in the sim scene, if I dare ask?

1737
02:01:45,760 --> 02:01:50,760
A few things. The first being really cool, and that would be PSP Revolution.

1738
02:01:50,760 --> 02:01:54,760
And it's basically kind of a port of StepMania for the PSP.

1739
02:01:54,760 --> 02:01:59,760
And you can play your sim files on that. The only thing it doesn't support right now is modifiers,

1740
02:01:59,760 --> 02:02:04,760
so that's not in there, but at least it plays and it works, and it's pretty fun.

1741
02:02:04,760 --> 02:02:09,460
you know, best you can do with Controller Controller Revolution, so. You can actually

1742
02:02:09,460 --> 02:02:13,320
download that. We have a link on our website to where you can download that. It's pretty

1743
02:02:13,320 --> 02:02:16,560
awesome. It actually comes with a couple CIN file packs in there so you can check out some

1744
02:02:16,560 --> 02:02:23,920
songs. But yeah, so far, not bad for our first release. And that's about it, that's pretty

1745
02:02:23,920 --> 02:02:30,420
much about it. All the important stuff at least. All right. Oops, my help with my mic

1746
02:02:30,420 --> 02:02:34,020
was on. All right, now what we're going to do is do a little segment of the program we

1747
02:02:34,020 --> 02:02:40,900
we call Orange Lounge Radio goes to the movies! Yay! Movie! Movie! Please note that this is

1748
02:02:40,900 --> 02:02:43,740
different from Extraverse Movie Review, which he will be doing later in the show, I just

1749
02:02:43,740 --> 02:02:50,820
want to say though. However, we like to sometimes watch a movie together and comment on it for

1750
02:02:50,820 --> 02:02:55,740
you guys. And the movie we're going to be commenting on this week is a news article

1751
02:02:55,740 --> 02:02:59,920
that was recently, or actually not really an article, a news broadcast that was recently

1752
02:02:59,920 --> 02:03:07,480
on our local television station. It was WB-58, and it was Loki and Dark Sakura lending their

1753
02:03:07,480 --> 02:03:12,620
expert opinions on Guitar Hero. So let's check this out, shall we? I'm going to bring up

1754
02:03:12,620 --> 02:03:17,380
this video in studio. But of course, for those of you guys out there in internet radio land,

1755
02:03:17,380 --> 02:03:22,840
you guys will get to hear the audio of this, and we will interject as need be with comments.

1756
02:03:22,840 --> 02:03:23,840
So here we go.

1757
02:03:23,840 --> 02:03:26,560
Thank you. Well, a question I have for you is, have you ever secretly dreamed of being

1758
02:03:26,560 --> 02:03:29,040
a rock star, wailing on your electric guitar to...

1759
02:03:29,040 --> 02:03:35,040
I dream of that every night. Actually, there's nothing I love more than getting up on the bed and wailing like a rock star.

1760
02:03:35,040 --> 02:03:41,040
...sold out crowd. Well, for most people, the closest they'll ever get to playing is an air guitar in their living room.

1761
02:03:41,040 --> 02:03:42,040
Ooh!

1762
02:03:42,040 --> 02:03:45,040
With a new video game called Guitar Hero, just released today.

1763
02:03:45,040 --> 02:03:51,040
In other words, you can't afford this crap. We're showing this to you because, you know, we're rich and famous.

1764
02:03:51,040 --> 02:03:55,040
It's designed to get wannabe rockers closer to the real stage experience.

1765
02:03:55,040 --> 02:04:04,040
Brian Hickey rocks on. He asks the producers of the demo guitar hero for a couple of local gamers, so we can get their reactions. Rock on.

1766
02:04:25,040 --> 02:04:29,720
something else and I forgot now, so we'll just let it keep going. Oh, I was going to say something about the gamers.

1767
02:04:29,720 --> 02:04:33,440
Apparently Loki and DarkSakura are now the expert gamers in town.

1768
02:04:33,440 --> 02:04:35,480
Local crazed gamer!

1769
02:04:35,480 --> 02:04:39,360
Yeah, uh, which, which, uh, you know, Rio's stationery part of.

1770
02:04:39,360 --> 02:04:42,680
Oh, that's why we can't mention that. Yeah, that's why. They don't ever say that it's Orange

1771
02:04:42,680 --> 02:04:45,640
Lounge Radio, by the way. Never. It's just the two expert gamers.

1772
02:04:45,640 --> 02:04:52,000
Two crazed gamers. I'm wearing a t-shirt next time. I tell you, if I had a shirt. Seriously, me too.

1773
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:59,000
The box office is sold out, your guitar is tuned, and you're about to play one of the

1774
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:01,240
greatest rock songs of all time.

1775
02:05:01,240 --> 02:05:04,600
For the longest time during this interview, I thought that was going to be the only thing

1776
02:05:04,600 --> 02:05:05,600
I had to say.

1777
02:05:05,600 --> 02:05:06,600
Let's see here.

1778
02:05:06,600 --> 02:05:09,600
By the way, are you chewing gum?

1779
02:05:09,600 --> 02:05:10,600
I'm not chewing gum.

1780
02:05:10,600 --> 02:05:11,600
Oh no, your cheeks are just puffy.

1781
02:05:11,600 --> 02:05:12,600
I guess that's what it is.

1782
02:05:12,600 --> 02:05:13,600
I'm just kidding.

1783
02:05:13,600 --> 02:05:14,600
I'm just kidding.

1784
02:05:14,600 --> 02:05:15,600
Listen, asshole.

1785
02:05:15,600 --> 02:05:22,600
an asshole. Just because I took time off your work to come play this stupid game.

1786
02:05:22,600 --> 02:05:26,600
I thought you liked the game. You give it a good score later.

1787
02:05:26,600 --> 02:05:34,600
Oh yeah, I give it a good score, but you know what? I had to drive like a freaking half an hour during my lunch break to come play this game.

1788
02:05:34,600 --> 02:05:36,600
Whatever.

1789
02:05:39,600 --> 02:05:44,600
That's the idea behind Red Octane's new guitar hero.

1790
02:05:44,600 --> 02:05:50,600
Rock music inspired this game, so having full length songs is really important.

1791
02:05:50,600 --> 02:05:56,600
Game producer John Tam shows Jamie Devrend and Matt Whiteman, two avid gamers, how to play.

1792
02:05:56,600 --> 02:05:59,600
I didn't know how to play this before you showed me, dumbass.

1793
02:05:59,600 --> 02:06:01,600
Hey now, hey now.

1794
02:06:01,600 --> 02:06:07,600
No chords to learn. To create music, John presses colored fret buttons to match those on the screen

1795
02:06:07,600 --> 02:06:13,600
while hitting the strum bar once for each note. The goal? Nail as many notes as you can to rack up the high score.

1796
02:06:13,600 --> 02:06:18,300
high score. See, now that guy thought ahead, he's wearing his Guitar Hero shirt on. So,

1797
02:06:18,300 --> 02:06:21,120
you're right, we need to get orange lounge shirts for all these reasons, for all the

1798
02:06:21,120 --> 02:06:25,840
media whoredom. If I don't play anything, the guitar track doesn't play. And if I hit

1799
02:06:25,840 --> 02:06:29,640
this thing... Go figure that that would happen, that when you don't play anything, the guitar

1800
02:06:29,640 --> 02:06:33,600
track won't play. Go figure. I'm just giving this poor guy a hard time. And if you fuck

1801
02:06:33,600 --> 02:06:40,160
up a lot, then you start doing the jig and then you walk off stage. You get these trashy

1802
02:06:40,160 --> 02:06:44,400
Each guitar guru character has its own extroverted personality.

1803
02:06:44,400 --> 02:06:47,960
There's Pandora, princess of rock, and punk virtuoso

1804
02:06:47,960 --> 02:06:52,480
Johnny Napalm, among others. I love the Ramones, so I played I Wanna Be Sedated.

1805
02:06:52,480 --> 02:06:55,840
She's lying, she really loves the gorillas.

1806
02:06:55,840 --> 02:06:59,840
She doesn't, she's, no I'm just... Who doesn't love the Ramones? The Ramones are awesome.

1807
02:06:59,840 --> 02:07:03,240
That, by the way, that was the little clip that they used in the commercial, but I think what's

1808
02:07:03,240 --> 02:07:04,680
great about this, watch

1809
02:07:04,680 --> 02:07:07,600
how they do, and I know this is horrible for the radio, but watch how they do this

1810
02:07:07,600 --> 02:07:10,900
next little clip like in beat with the music after she says she loves the Ramones and she's

1811
02:07:10,900 --> 02:07:11,900
playing here.

1812
02:07:11,900 --> 02:07:19,360
And I'm looking bored in the background.

1813
02:07:19,360 --> 02:07:21,080
The solos usually kill people.

1814
02:07:21,080 --> 02:07:23,040
Then she discovers the whammy bar.

1815
02:07:23,040 --> 02:07:26,000
The whammy bar, whammy bar.

1816
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:29,920
And then she discovered my whammy bar.

1817
02:07:29,920 --> 02:07:30,920
I hate...

1818
02:07:30,920 --> 02:07:32,160
The whammy bar is my favorite part.

1819
02:07:32,160 --> 02:07:36,480
I don't know why the hell I decided to be in these stupid news interviews because they're

1820
02:07:36,480 --> 02:07:42,200
really bad. No, they're only bad when I bring them on the radio and start, you know, making

1821
02:07:42,200 --> 02:07:46,240
fun of them. It's just, it's embarrassing. It's embarrassing. Because I love, I tease

1822
02:07:46,240 --> 02:07:52,320
because I love to make fun of you. It does nothing for our station. It's like, it's like

1823
02:07:52,320 --> 02:07:56,280
gymnastics, you have to land that last note. I love how like Jamie's taking the guitar

1824
02:07:56,280 --> 02:08:00,880
off, this guy's talking like, get this fucking thing out of here. No, I'm kidding. Keep going.

1825
02:08:00,880 --> 02:08:05,400
This is funny. To give you the experience of being on stage, this room takes you inside

1826
02:08:05,400 --> 02:08:09,340
the different venues, from practice rooms and basements to sold out stadiums, and the

1827
02:08:09,340 --> 02:08:13,560
fans react, jumping up and down when you rock the house or letting you know if you're playing

1828
02:08:13,560 --> 02:08:14,560
stinks.

1829
02:08:14,560 --> 02:08:18,360
Xtifer, wasn't this the same reporter you thought was cute?

1830
02:08:18,360 --> 02:08:23,240
Yeah, I still think he's cute.

1831
02:08:23,240 --> 02:08:27,120
You don't play well, they don't like you, they'll start leaving the venue and start

1832
02:08:27,120 --> 02:08:31,120
booing you, and then eventually if you die, your whole band gives up and throws their

1833
02:08:31,120 --> 02:08:35,520
hands up in frustration against you.

1834
02:08:35,520 --> 02:08:38,840
See I don't understand that because you know in the real world violin keeps

1835
02:08:38,840 --> 02:08:40,560
lasting on but can they sing

1836
02:08:40,560 --> 02:08:46,040
and yet, never mind, nobody's going to understand that joke.

1837
02:08:46,040 --> 02:08:50,120
Matt likes the fact that Guitar Hero offers different rock genres to explore.

1838
02:08:50,120 --> 02:08:53,720
By the way that's my DDR pad in the background, that's my cameo in the story.

1839
02:08:53,720 --> 02:08:57,880
That's my dance pad lying there unloved in the background.

1840
02:08:57,880 --> 02:09:02,320
I don't even know why I had my dance pads there but I think

1841
02:09:02,320 --> 02:09:06,960
is it oh yes it's the old red octane pad though. From classic rock and hard rock to

1842
02:09:06,960 --> 02:09:07,500
modern

1843
02:09:07,500 --> 02:09:11,200
punk even blues. Fun game. Really fun game.

1844
02:09:11,200 --> 02:09:14,640
To kick his song into high gear Matt tilts the guitar up

1845
02:09:14,640 --> 02:09:18,760
activating star power which allows him to rack up even more points.

1846
02:09:18,760 --> 02:09:22,640
Really good party game I mean especially you know get a bunch of friends together

1847
02:09:22,640 --> 02:09:23,200
just

1848
02:09:23,200 --> 02:09:26,640
you know don't see it, smash up some music. Don't see it. Don't see it. Really fun.

1849
02:09:26,640 --> 02:09:29,640
So how do you do these two gamers, right, guitar hero?

1850
02:09:29,640 --> 02:09:31,640
I'd definitely say it's at least an 8 out of a 10.

1851
02:09:31,640 --> 02:09:32,640
And Jamie?

1852
02:09:32,640 --> 02:09:34,640
Now, see, I could clip that and use that for some great problems.

1853
02:09:34,640 --> 02:09:38,640
I'd definitely say it's at least an 8 out of 10.

1854
02:09:38,640 --> 02:09:41,640
So, Loki, how big is Skye's penis?

1855
02:09:41,640 --> 02:09:46,640
I'd definitely say it's at least an 8 out of 10.

1856
02:09:46,640 --> 02:09:49,640
There's so much I could do with this.

1857
02:09:49,640 --> 02:09:51,640
Oh, 11.

1858
02:09:51,640 --> 02:09:52,640
What's with that?

1859
02:09:52,640 --> 02:09:53,640
Yeah, she had to go...

1860
02:09:53,640 --> 02:09:54,640
Where's Jamie in the 11s lately?

1861
02:09:54,640 --> 02:09:55,640
She had to go one...

1862
02:09:55,640 --> 02:10:03,640
They set a scale of 1 to 10. I was basically giving a ranking within the criteria that they had, and she had to go out of the criteria.

1863
02:10:03,640 --> 02:10:06,640
I don't know. It wasn't an 11 game for me or whatever.

1864
02:10:06,640 --> 02:10:08,640
I like the game. I like the musical.

1865
02:10:08,640 --> 02:10:12,640
It's just completely rocking out. It feels like playing an actual guitar.

1866
02:10:12,640 --> 02:10:16,640
Yeah, they show it. They let her talk, and they paraphrase me.

1867
02:10:16,640 --> 02:10:22,640
Brian Hickey, WB58 News at 10.

1868
02:10:22,640 --> 02:10:25,640
Well, maybe what she's saying is more intelligent as opposed to,

1869
02:10:25,640 --> 02:10:27,640
It's so fun!

1870
02:10:27,640 --> 02:10:30,640
Oh man, I just got the death stare.

1871
02:10:30,640 --> 02:10:35,640
This, by the way, will be the last episode on this video.

1872
02:10:35,640 --> 02:10:39,640
Alright, anyway, let's see what the two goons on the TV have to say about this.

1873
02:10:39,640 --> 02:10:41,640
You gotta love playing that air guitar.

1874
02:10:41,640 --> 02:10:43,640
I'd like to have that mohawk going on.

1875
02:10:43,640 --> 02:10:45,640
Well, Guitar Hero is designed to be played on PlayStation.

1876
02:10:45,640 --> 02:10:48,640
By the way, he's talking about his pubic hair right there. I'd like to have that mohawk going on.

1877
02:10:48,640 --> 02:10:50,640
Two, and it cost about $70.

1878
02:10:50,640 --> 02:10:53,640
Stay with us. More to come right after the break.

1879
02:10:53,640 --> 02:11:03,640
They did also, I want to add, they also did a story apparently about In the Groove and how people are losing weight on it.

1880
02:11:03,640 --> 02:11:10,640
To which I could basically go, so you're recycling news now?

1881
02:11:10,640 --> 02:11:13,200
didn't I didn't see the in the groove story and I didn't get we weren't part

1882
02:11:13,200 --> 02:11:16,880
of it so I didn't bother to tape it but I would have laughed if they wanted me

1883
02:11:16,880 --> 02:11:20,360
to play this game so what do you give in the groove well well originally in the

1884
02:11:20,360 --> 02:11:24,680
original email I thought that that was because that's why I hyped it up like I

1885
02:11:24,680 --> 02:11:27,720
did is that you're never gonna believe what Loki and dark soccer are gonna be

1886
02:11:27,720 --> 02:11:30,840
doing on the news because originally it was supposed to be for in the groove and

1887
02:11:30,840 --> 02:11:35,280
guitar hero but I guess something got fixed yeah I would have been cut off TV

1888
02:11:35,280 --> 02:11:39,320
for that yeah all right anyway we're gonna go to another break one more break

1889
02:11:39,320 --> 02:11:42,480
here of Ultramix 3 music and then we're going to come back and we're going to reveal the

1890
02:11:42,480 --> 02:11:47,760
winner of tonight's cage match. We will also get into the FUs of the week and do extra

1891
02:11:47,760 --> 02:11:51,320
first movie review. We can't forget that. So don't send your FUs just yet though because

1892
02:11:51,320 --> 02:11:56,080
I haven't tallied cage match votes but this is the last opportunity for you guys to get

1893
02:11:56,080 --> 02:11:59,600
your stuff into the cage match and everything you want to vote for there. Alright, we're

1894
02:11:59,600 --> 02:12:02,640
going to go into this break and in this break I think we're going to start it off with the

1895
02:12:02,640 --> 02:12:09,640
brand new Naoki track from DDR Ultramix 3. This is Naoki with Brilliant Red.

1896
02:12:32,640 --> 02:12:45,640
I knew the first time I saw you out on the floor

1897
02:12:45,640 --> 02:12:48,640
Said you were so much more

1898
02:12:48,640 --> 02:12:52,640
It's just the way that you move your body with mine

1899
02:12:52,640 --> 02:12:55,640
Feels like we had no concept of time

1900
02:12:55,640 --> 02:12:59,640
It's just the way that you grew, that's what we do

1901
02:12:59,640 --> 02:13:04,640
I wanna show you how much we can move

1902
02:13:05,640 --> 02:13:08,640
This is the night made for just you and I

1903
02:13:08,640 --> 02:13:11,640
This is the night, won't you take me inside?

1904
02:13:11,640 --> 02:13:14,640
This is the night, now look into my eyes

1905
02:13:14,640 --> 02:13:17,640
I want you, I need you to make it alright

1906
02:13:17,640 --> 02:13:21,640
Let's dance tonight like the last of our lives

1907
02:13:21,640 --> 02:13:24,640
Let's dance tonight, won't you know you were kind?

1908
02:13:24,640 --> 02:13:27,640
Let's dance tonight, made for just you and I

1909
02:13:27,640 --> 02:13:34,640
I want you, I need you, my whole life I want you

1910
02:13:57,640 --> 02:14:12,040
Too many words on the tip of my tongue and I can never figure out

1911
02:14:12,040 --> 02:14:15,560
When to speak, when to shout, when to shut up

1912
02:14:15,560 --> 02:14:17,560
When to knock myself out

1913
02:14:17,560 --> 02:14:22,440
I need a brainwash, cream and a bath I need the butter all thrown in the trash

1914
02:14:22,440 --> 02:14:27,320
I need a brainwash, cause I'm a loon So could you please throw my head in a tub

1915
02:14:27,320 --> 02:14:35,320
I can really use a cerebral scrub Wash away what I know It's an overrated frontal lobe

1916
02:14:43,320 --> 02:14:52,320
Too many words on the tip of my tongue and I can never figure out When to speak, when to shout, when to shut up When to knock myself out

1917
02:14:52,320 --> 02:14:53,320
Brainwash!

1918
02:14:53,320 --> 02:14:55,320
I need a brainwash, green matter fast

1919
02:14:55,320 --> 02:14:58,320
I need to clutter up, run in the trash

1920
02:14:58,320 --> 02:15:00,320
I need a brainwash, cause I'm a woon

1921
02:15:00,320 --> 02:15:02,320
Cause of the spike of pebble brain

1922
02:15:02,320 --> 02:15:04,320
I'm really moving to the midst of many air

1923
02:15:04,320 --> 02:15:07,320
I'm trying to find what's a pussy in a room

1924
02:15:07,320 --> 02:15:09,320
Right here's your nickel pin and candy for a gene

1925
02:15:09,320 --> 02:15:12,320
Cause I wanna do a sing to an angel

1926
02:15:12,320 --> 02:15:14,320
Something I like to sing in minor technology

1927
02:15:14,320 --> 02:15:17,320
Nothing needs a duck to just lean on my head in a tuck

1928
02:15:17,320 --> 02:15:20,320
I could really use just a river or a truck

1929
02:15:20,320 --> 02:15:25,320
Watch your way when I know It's been overrated pronto-mo

1930
02:15:25,320 --> 02:15:44,720
So many times I'm watching you And now I fell in love with you

1931
02:15:44,720 --> 02:15:52,320
So many times, so many times

1932
02:15:52,320 --> 02:16:16,320
Do your heart, feel so lonely, think about your sweetest dreams

1933
02:16:16,320 --> 02:16:24,320
Close your eyes and follow me And I take you to my destiny

1934
02:16:24,320 --> 02:16:32,320
I'm thinking about you all the time When I keep my love to you, that's the time

1935
02:16:32,320 --> 02:16:38,320
So many times I've been watching you And now I fell in love with you

1936
02:16:38,320 --> 02:16:41,320
Oh, I want you

1937
02:16:41,320 --> 02:16:45,320
And now I'm fell in love with you

1938
02:16:45,320 --> 02:16:49,320

So many times

1940
02:16:52,320 --> 02:16:56,320
Oh, I want you

1941
02:16:56,320 --> 02:17:00,320
And now I'm fell in love with you

1942
02:17:00,320 --> 02:17:03,320
So many times

1943
02:17:03,320 --> 02:17:07,320
So many times

1944
02:17:07,320 --> 02:17:10,320
Get up and let the best you can make come

1945
02:17:20,320 --> 02:17:25,320
I'm in love and love is what I like

1946
02:17:27,320 --> 02:17:32,320
Spin me, shape me, make me feel alright

1947
02:17:32,320 --> 02:17:39,320
I'm in love and love is what I like

1948
02:17:39,320 --> 02:17:46,320
Lifting my imperfection

1949
02:17:46,320 --> 02:17:53,320
Waiting for your direction

1950
02:17:53,320 --> 02:18:08,320
I'm in love, I'm in love, and it's what I like

1951
02:18:08,320 --> 02:18:17,320
And you shake me, make me feel alright

1952
02:18:17,320 --> 02:18:32,320
This is my imperfection, waiting for your direction

1953
02:18:32,320 --> 02:18:39,320
This ain't no thing I feel alright, my imperfection

1954
02:18:39,320 --> 02:18:43,320
If you want to save my day, I'm gonna give you a ride

1955
02:18:43,320 --> 02:18:53,720
After this song, we'll be having a Let Them Move Marathon.

1956
02:18:53,720 --> 02:18:54,720
Nooooooo!

1957
02:18:54,720 --> 02:19:00,120
Just kidding, Orange Lounge Radio, crap-free bovani radio.

1958
02:19:00,120 --> 02:19:02,600
Welcome back, boys and girls, to Orange Lounge Radio.

1959
02:19:02,600 --> 02:19:06,440
I bet you kids are just dying to know who won tonight's cage match, aren't ya?

1960
02:19:06,440 --> 02:19:09,680
You're just dying to know, you just wanna know so badly.

1961
02:19:09,680 --> 02:19:13,440
Here it is, the wiener of tonight's cage match tonight is...

1962
02:19:13,440 --> 02:19:23,840
John Sykes, with cautionary warning, shoot all of you.

1963
02:19:23,840 --> 02:19:24,840
Rock on.

1964
02:19:24,840 --> 02:19:29,200
By the way, check the live journal community, Sakurina did like the best, dude it took Sakurina

1965
02:19:29,200 --> 02:19:34,640
like five minutes to turn that into, just like I imagined, into a little picture with

1966
02:19:34,640 --> 02:19:35,640
the guy doing the rock on sign.

1967
02:19:35,640 --> 02:19:38,760
We should all get a picture of us doing the rock on symbol from that.

1968
02:19:38,760 --> 02:19:42,360
And we could send it to him! And he'd be all, he'd be all, what the fuck is this?

1969
02:19:42,360 --> 02:19:44,260
Cause he wouldn't, he wouldn't remember doing that, I mean.

1970
02:19:44,260 --> 02:19:45,260
It's your fan!

1971
02:19:45,260 --> 02:19:48,260
It's your, yeah, it's your fan club, Mr. Newsperson.

1972
02:19:50,260 --> 02:19:51,760
Oh, shit. Alright.

1973
02:19:54,260 --> 02:19:57,260
Alright, we're gonna get into the FUs of the week,

1974
02:19:57,260 --> 02:20:00,660
and, uh, first in order for us to get into the FUs of the week,

1975
02:20:00,660 --> 02:20:02,260
I have to have the music queued up,

1976
02:20:02,260 --> 02:20:04,260
because that's an important part of having the FUs of the week.

1977
02:20:05,260 --> 02:20:05,760
Oh, you have a new-

1978
02:20:06,260 --> 02:20:07,260
Oh, that's right!

1979
02:20:07,260 --> 02:20:11,140
Loki has a new song finally tonight. You're getting rid of Menomina?

1980
02:20:11,140 --> 02:20:14,140
Yeah, I have to.

1981
02:20:14,140 --> 02:20:19,220
That makes me kind of sad. That's right, I'll let Mel and Melody have Menomina then.

1982
02:20:19,220 --> 02:20:22,220
Since you're not going to be using it.

1983
02:20:22,220 --> 02:20:26,220
You were showing me your video iPod, which I'm so jealous that you have all the latest toys, but what did you do with this?

1984
02:20:26,220 --> 02:20:31,220
So I go and get a video iPod and I'm like, oh my god, I have the new toy, I love this thing.

1985
02:20:31,220 --> 02:20:36,220
So what's the first freaking video I put on it? Menomina.

1986
02:20:36,220 --> 02:20:43,060
Alright, um, let's get into the FUs of the week, and Dark Sakura is usually the one that

1987
02:20:43,060 --> 02:20:44,060
starts us off.

1988
02:20:44,060 --> 02:20:48,060
However, I will be entering FUs on Dark Sakura's behalf tonight, so here we go in the FUs of

1989
02:20:48,060 --> 02:20:49,060
the week.

1990
02:20:49,060 --> 02:21:04,060
Uh, Dark Sakura, I'll be entering some FUs on Dark Sakura's behalf, um, first FU is to

1991
02:21:04,060 --> 02:21:07,780
being sick, because I know she's been sick for like two weeks straight now, and also

1992
02:21:07,780 --> 02:21:13,500
to bronchitis, which she has, which sucks, and the F.U. to pneumonia for scaring her,

1993
02:21:13,500 --> 02:21:18,020
you know, thinking that she might have had pneumonia, and I think she's very angsty that

1994
02:21:18,020 --> 02:21:21,260
she didn't get out to do a lot of stuff this weekend that she wanted to do, so I'm sure

1995
02:21:21,260 --> 02:21:25,540
she's very pissed off about that, so an F.U. to being homebound, I guess you could call

1996
02:21:25,540 --> 02:21:31,300
it, but an F.U. to having to go to work tomorrow. And I think that would about wrap up everything

1997
02:21:31,300 --> 02:21:35,780
the dark soccer would be anxious, at least as far as I know, for now.

1998
02:21:35,780 --> 02:21:42,780
Uh, let's go into, uh, Loki's FUs.

1999
02:21:43,460 --> 02:21:49,340
Okay, um...

2000
02:21:49,340 --> 02:21:51,220
First off,

2001
02:21:51,220 --> 02:21:54,060
fuck you to Chevron Oil Stop

2002
02:21:54,060 --> 02:21:56,000
for breaking my car.

2003
02:21:56,000 --> 02:22:01,140
Um, now my car is leaking coolant out, and I'm sure it's not supposed to be doing that,

2004
02:22:01,140 --> 02:22:05,360
Because I pour the coolant in, and it pours right out the bottom, so that's not very good.

2005
02:22:05,360 --> 02:22:06,940
However, it doesn't empty, so...

2006
02:22:06,940 --> 02:22:11,820
Just overheats, and I gotta take you to the dealership tomorrow, which requires me to take time off work.

2007
02:22:11,820 --> 02:22:13,780
It's just a pain in the ass.

2008
02:22:13,780 --> 02:22:14,680
So fuck that.

2009
02:22:14,680 --> 02:22:19,280
And fuck you old Asian women drivers, because god damn it, you fuckin' suck.

2010
02:22:19,280 --> 02:22:22,980
I'm sittin' in the car, watching you drive, and you suck so bad.

2011
02:22:22,980 --> 02:22:28,300
You know, braking when there's, like, a car fifty feet in front of you, and, like, having your turn signal on,

2012
02:22:28,300 --> 02:22:32,860
switching lanes the wrong direction it's just a pain in the ass and you just

2013
02:22:32,860 --> 02:22:37,780
really you know are reinforcing the stereotypes so fuck old Asian women

2014
02:22:37,780 --> 02:22:51,420
drivers and finally Rocko my turn I would like to give an F you to me being a

2015
02:22:51,420 --> 02:22:55,460
workaholic recently and me being very lazy on the weekend and not having any

2016
02:22:55,460 --> 02:22:59,060
time to crack the test because I'm too lazy and if you did the fact that it

2017
02:22:59,060 --> 02:23:03,860
took me like an hour to get that set up earlier tonight to rip the ultra mix

2018
02:23:03,860 --> 02:23:08,580
three songs directly from the Xbox and no one appreciates it because the

2019
02:23:08,580 --> 02:23:15,580
song list is kind of whack and I just give I don't know a nephew to the fact

2020
02:23:15,580 --> 02:23:18,020
that I have to go back to work tomorrow but at least it's a short week and

2021
02:23:18,020 --> 02:23:21,100
Thanksgiving summer if you do Thanksgiving because it's a holiday I

2022
02:23:21,100 --> 02:23:24,100
never really got I don't I don't get Thanksgiving but maybe it's just my

2023
02:23:24,100 --> 02:23:29,620
family because we're special, my family. You should really call it for what it is. Black

2024
02:23:29,620 --> 02:23:39,100
Friday Eve. Oh, or the shopping day, yeah. Crazy. Alright, let's go on to a melody. We're

2025
02:23:39,100 --> 02:23:40,500
going to do Her Refuse first.

2026
02:23:40,500 --> 02:23:52,020
Yay! I like my freaking theme song. Okay, seriously, at work there's this chick who

2027
02:23:52,020 --> 02:23:55,780
knows the song and loves my video ipod as much as i do and will yell across the

2028
02:23:55,780 --> 02:23:58,580
office to each other monomenon and the other one will reply it's great

2029
02:23:58,580 --> 02:23:59,500
anyway

2030
02:23:59,500 --> 02:24:01,640
f u to uh...

2031
02:24:01,640 --> 02:24:07,140
curbs because they really hurt when you fall on them and f u to my knee

2032
02:24:07,140 --> 02:24:09,940
for hurting when i hit the curb

2033
02:24:09,940 --> 02:24:12,840
uh... f u to my shoes which

2034
02:24:12,840 --> 02:24:16,020
went out sooner than they were supposed to, dude my shoes are supposed to last like three to five

2035
02:24:16,020 --> 02:24:18,900
hundred miles they only lasted two hundred

2036
02:24:18,900 --> 02:24:22,580
all my if you seem to be walk related at the moment that would be my life

2037
02:24:22,580 --> 02:24:24,600
but uh...

2038
02:24:24,600 --> 02:24:28,320
you know i feel offended i read that encounter a lot of them today coming up

2039
02:24:28,320 --> 02:24:30,940
here and they

2040
02:24:30,940 --> 02:24:36,620
and that i'm pretty mellow right now

2041
02:24:36,620 --> 02:24:39,420
and pretty simple

2042
02:24:39,420 --> 02:24:42,840
mister melby

2043
02:24:42,840 --> 02:24:44,720
uh... gosh uh...

2044
02:24:44,720 --> 02:24:46,820
i have my first appears to

2045
02:24:46,820 --> 02:24:49,700
all the video games stores and best buys in my area

2046
02:24:49,700 --> 02:24:51,860
because Guitar Hero is sold out everywhere

2047
02:24:51,860 --> 02:24:54,420
what really sucks is that the one best buy by my crib

2048
02:24:54,420 --> 02:24:57,140
I was asking the sales associate, you know, do you have this in stock

2049
02:24:57,140 --> 02:25:01,340
and he goes, uh, we don't have it right now, I'm like, can you check anyone nearby? He's like, okay

2050
02:25:01,340 --> 02:25:05,900
and there's like one that pops up over in South San Jose, it says like two on his screen

2051
02:25:05,900 --> 02:25:10,940
he goes, uh, we're sold out ever, I'm like, what about that San Jose over there? Uh, two means we're sold out

2052
02:25:10,940 --> 02:25:12,920
like, then why is there a two?

2053
02:25:12,920 --> 02:25:13,740
uh...

2054
02:25:13,740 --> 02:25:16,740
you can go there I guess, but no, trust me, it's sold out

2055
02:25:16,740 --> 02:25:20,460
like did i get you don't like helping people are making a fail

2056
02:25:20,460 --> 02:25:23,700
uh... whatever the hell you know i hope you're just happy with the minimum wage

2057
02:25:23,700 --> 02:25:24,740
or something

2058
02:25:24,740 --> 02:25:26,380
but uh...

2059
02:25:26,380 --> 02:25:30,220
other than that uh... i guess is that you cannot have enough time to do so

2060
02:25:30,220 --> 02:25:33,500
much stuff over the weekend and uh...

2061
02:25:33,500 --> 02:25:38,500
yeah happy for not having enough that used to be entertaining

2062
02:25:38,500 --> 02:25:40,900
right angel you have used to the week

2063
02:25:40,900 --> 02:25:42,700
and actually don't

2064
02:25:42,700 --> 02:25:43,820
have any

2065
02:25:43,820 --> 02:25:45,300
play

2066
02:25:45,300 --> 02:25:47,300
Nothing?

2067
02:25:47,300 --> 02:25:49,300
Aww, no more ball pits!

2068
02:25:49,300 --> 02:25:51,300
Can I drop?

2069
02:25:51,300 --> 02:25:53,300
I thought it was Beepman from LML. You did generic 2DX drops.

2070
02:25:53,300 --> 02:25:59,300
Well, I guess I could say a general SU, but then...

2071
02:25:59,300 --> 02:26:01,300
Out with it! Out with it!

2072
02:26:01,300 --> 02:26:03,300
Well, Beepman might look at me funny.

2073
02:26:03,300 --> 02:26:09,300
They need more games to help people with visual impairment, I think.

2074
02:26:09,300 --> 02:26:15,300
If it wasn't for certain World of Warcraft mods, I'd be in big trouble.

2075
02:26:15,300 --> 02:26:21,300
At least World of Warcraft is moddable enough to be able to do something like that.

2076
02:26:21,300 --> 02:26:26,300
I beat all the other people who don't think about that before they release a game.

2077
02:26:26,300 --> 02:26:31,300
Fair enough. At least the computer has it down pretty good with the accessibility options and everything.

2078
02:26:31,300 --> 02:26:36,300
Yes. This is why I'm a computer geek. I can see things.

2079
02:26:36,300 --> 02:26:37,300
What do you think?

2080
02:26:37,300 --> 02:26:38,300
Good to know.

2081
02:26:38,300 --> 02:26:39,300
Yay.

2082
02:26:39,300 --> 02:26:40,300
All right.

2083
02:26:40,300 --> 02:26:43,660
Now, it's my understanding that Dark Soccer was actually at her computer just now, and

2084
02:26:43,660 --> 02:26:47,180
she wanted to try and call in and get the real F.U., so I'm going to try and get her

2085
02:26:47,180 --> 02:26:48,580
on the line here.

2086
02:26:48,580 --> 02:26:50,460
Let's make this really quiet here.

2087
02:26:50,460 --> 02:26:51,460
Let's see if we can get Dark Soccer's F.U.

2088
02:26:51,460 --> 02:26:57,140
And then we'll go to the chat room F.U.s, of which I know you guys have plenty of F.U.s.

2089
02:26:57,140 --> 02:27:03,020
It's got that demon voice again.

2090
02:27:03,020 --> 02:27:05,020
Oh, wait, you there, Jamie?

2091
02:27:08,020 --> 02:27:09,020
Hello?

2092
02:27:09,020 --> 02:27:10,020
What now?

2093
02:27:10,020 --> 02:27:12,020
There we go, yes, now we're good.

2094
02:27:12,020 --> 02:27:13,020
Can you hear now?

2095
02:27:13,020 --> 02:27:14,020
Alright, great, yes, I can hear you now.

2096
02:27:14,020 --> 02:27:16,020
Are you ready to do your FUs?

2097
02:27:19,020 --> 02:27:20,020
This is what's wrong.

2098
02:27:21,020 --> 02:27:25,020
That's weird, I only heard, like, her for, like, five seconds there, something like, what's wrong?

2099
02:27:25,020 --> 02:27:28,020
Uh, you're, oh, shoot, did it just hang up?

2100
02:27:29,020 --> 02:27:31,020
It hung up! No, no!

2101
02:27:31,020 --> 02:27:35,020
Okay, wait. She's calling us back. Let me make sure all my other crap is closed. I have nothing else going on there.

2102
02:27:35,020 --> 02:27:39,020
Okay, let's try this again. Let me try closing iTunes, because iTunes is a real memory hog. That might be part of the problem.

2103
02:27:39,020 --> 02:27:41,020
All right, here we go. Yes?

2104
02:27:41,020 --> 02:27:43,020
Excuse me.

2105
02:27:43,020 --> 02:27:45,020
There we go. Now you're there.

2106
02:27:45,020 --> 02:27:49,020
It's because I disconnected IRC. It's a delay that IRC is causing.

2107
02:27:49,020 --> 02:27:53,020
Interesting. Okay, are you ready to do your FUs? I have your music already.

2108
02:27:53,020 --> 02:27:55,020
Yeah, I'm pretty ready.

2109
02:27:55,020 --> 02:27:57,020
All right, here we go.

2110
02:27:57,020 --> 02:28:09,940
My first SU goes toward having a pissed off and depressed husband.

2111
02:28:09,940 --> 02:28:14,740
My second SU goes to people who are pissed off at everyone who is able to get an Xbox

2112
02:28:14,740 --> 02:28:16,420
360 on launch date.

2113
02:28:16,420 --> 02:28:19,380
Just because you can't get one bitch don't mean you should get to be down with everybody

2114
02:28:19,380 --> 02:28:20,380
else.

2115
02:28:20,380 --> 02:28:21,380
Hello?

2116
02:28:21,380 --> 02:28:34,000
Second, the third one goes toward my pre-pneumonia and the fact that my antibiotics are just

2117
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:41,560
now starting to make me feel sicker and I can't really think of much of anything else.

2118
02:28:41,560 --> 02:28:45,600
Those are the major pressing items on my mind.

2119
02:28:45,600 --> 02:28:48,640
Alrighty, well I'm glad we could get you back on for the FUs.

2120
02:28:48,640 --> 02:28:54,040
all it is your your baby here on the program the angst so of course it's not

2121
02:28:54,040 --> 02:28:57,280
at ease about me all right well we're gonna let you go for now though so we

2122

Lincoln right now is nephew so get a cup of cocoa this is gonna be like an

2126
02:29:15,440 --> 02:29:19,840
and Ultramix 3 loading screen.

2127
02:29:19,840 --> 02:29:23,760
Sakurina says FU to Konami for not having In My Dreams in any games other than Dance

2128
02:29:23,760 --> 02:29:24,760
Maniac's first mix.

2129
02:29:24,760 --> 02:29:28,040
It's the best Dance Mania song ever and you guys can't even bother putting it in anything

2130
02:29:28,040 --> 02:29:29,040
but Dance Maniacs?

2131
02:29:29,040 --> 02:29:30,040
Fuck you!

2132
02:29:30,040 --> 02:29:33,400
Also, FU to the stupid teacher who made me fail his class because he made an error and

2133
02:29:33,400 --> 02:29:34,400
still won't correct it.

2134
02:29:34,400 --> 02:29:38,240
FU to the smoker bitch at the bus stop who never stops blowing her goddamn cigarette

2135
02:29:38,240 --> 02:29:39,240
smoke my way.

2136
02:29:39,240 --> 02:29:42,920
And final FU, FU to the Xbox 360 for being an overrated piece of shit.

2137
02:29:42,920 --> 02:29:45,880
Thanks Microsoft for making me a sucky demo kiosk.

2138
02:29:45,880 --> 02:29:47,760
That was from Sakarina.

2139
02:29:47,760 --> 02:29:50,640
Darkknight would like to say,

2140
02:29:50,640 --> 02:29:57,240
F you to having to get up at 5 a.m. to catch a bus to get to work now and F you to being broke again.

2141
02:29:57,240 --> 02:30:04,880
NintendoManiac64 says F you to you guys not noticing that someone was playing Mario Kart DS about an hour ago.

2142
02:30:04,880 --> 02:30:09,200
No, I knew Loki had been playing Mario Kart DS all night, but I didn't think the mic was picking it up.

2143
02:30:09,200 --> 02:30:12,320
F you to you guys for not sharing your MKDS friend codes.

2144
02:30:12,320 --> 02:30:18,640
I'll give it out. Just send me a private message on Orange Lounge. I just don't want the freaky other people on the internet to be adding me and shit.

2145
02:30:18,640 --> 02:30:21,040
Although I guess I have to have them on my list, huh?

2146
02:30:21,040 --> 02:30:23,360
I guess I'd be safe.

2147
02:30:23,360 --> 02:30:24,560
I'm nervous.

2148
02:30:24,560 --> 02:30:27,840
Because there's stalker people out there and I don't want to watch out for them.

2149
02:30:27,840 --> 02:30:33,800
F you to my DSL for crapping out three times during the show. F you to prawn adware.

2150
02:30:33,800 --> 02:30:40,040
And when he says prawn, he means pornography, hardcore pornography.

2151
02:30:40,040 --> 02:30:45,960
DarklionXBI says, F you to Colin Cowherd of ESPN Radio for dissing the late Eddie Guerrero.

2152
02:30:45,960 --> 02:30:47,520
Oh, I heard about this.

2153
02:30:47,520 --> 02:30:51,080
You might have no interest in professional wrestling, but dissing the dead is unforgivable.

2154
02:30:51,080 --> 02:30:54,080
I hope you die and see what it's like to be dissed dead.

2155
02:30:54,080 --> 02:30:58,680
You know what, I don't follow wrestling, so I didn't, but that's why I don't say anything

2156
02:30:58,680 --> 02:31:01,120
about it, because I don't follow it, so I just, you know, um.

2157
02:31:01,120 --> 02:31:04,120
Well, if it's any consolation, I'm 100% behind that FU.

2158
02:31:04,120 --> 02:31:12,120
Yeah, I understand it's a big deal, you know. Don't fuck with wrestling fans, man. They will throw you to the mat.

2159
02:31:12,120 --> 02:31:18,120
Dude, one of the pro wrestling sites put up the ESPN comment line and email address, and the wrestling fans crashed both.

2160
02:31:18,120 --> 02:31:20,120
Oh, I can imagine.

2161
02:31:20,120 --> 02:31:28,120
F.U. to some people telling me to stop correcting at things.

2162
02:31:28,120 --> 02:31:33,120
Hey, they might be something little to you, but that's a big thing to me.

2163
02:31:33,120 --> 02:31:39,120
SSJ100Matt says F.U. to work screwing me over this week and making me miss my first Thanksgiving away from home.

2164
02:31:39,120 --> 02:31:45,120
F.U. to True Crimes New York City for being such a good game but glitchy and choppy as hell.

2165
02:31:45,120 --> 02:31:52,120
PopePanda says F you to my gimpy father for preventing me from getting Indian food.

2166
02:31:52,120 --> 02:31:56,120
Too spicy? I don't know.

2167
02:31:56,120 --> 02:32:02,120
Illusions says F you to being sick for two weeks straight and F you to having two. Count them two papers due this week.

2168
02:32:02,120 --> 02:32:09,120
MPQ says F you to being completely unprepared for my Japanese test tomorrow and F you to the Ultra K tarnishing the new arcade with 2DX.

2169
02:32:09,120 --> 02:32:13,120
I think there was something else that I forget so F you to my shit memory.

2170
02:32:13,120 --> 02:32:20,120
3. Neo14789 says, F you to the creative Xbox 360 distribution strategy. It sucks!

2171
02:32:20,120 --> 02:32:25,600
4. XanagerC would like to say, F you to being on the east coast. It's too damn late right

2172
02:32:25,600 --> 02:32:30,440
now. Like midnight. Sorry, that's our bad. Damn us being on the west coast.

2173
02:32:30,440 --> 02:32:35,800
5. Misty says, F you to having a work Friday. Nuff said and I don't care that I'm off for

2174
02:32:35,800 --> 02:32:39,240
Thanksgiving itself. And of course, fuck cage match. Well, love you too, babe.

2175
02:32:39,240 --> 02:32:44,040
Dark Knight says, F you to my PC telling me I have to reinstall windows because one file

2176
02:32:44,040 --> 02:32:45,840
went mysteriously missing.

2177
02:32:45,840 --> 02:32:50,560
Legend of Zaku says, F you to MTV for being unprepared assholes who have no gaming taste,

2178
02:32:50,560 --> 02:32:52,440
but at least they gave me two $50 games.

2179
02:32:52,440 --> 02:32:54,440
Thanks MTV for pimping my checking account.

2180
02:32:54,440 --> 02:33:00,040
F you to GameStop for having the gall of offering me $14 for my sealed copy of NBA Live 06 and

2181
02:33:00,040 --> 02:33:03,120
20% less of that if I wanted cash for it.

2182
02:33:03,120 --> 02:33:06,880
Roz would like to say F you to whatever my dad's deal was last night, F you to the basketball

2183
02:33:06,880 --> 02:33:10,360
team for constantly bitching about the people in the school play. It's not our fault that

2184
02:33:10,360 --> 02:33:17,200
the directors were bitches to you. F you to my sensitive skin for being sensitive.

2185
02:33:17,200 --> 02:33:22,680
And BX JasonXV says F you to fanboys. Brilliant red sucks. It's not a good song. Go listen

2186
02:33:22,680 --> 02:33:28,240
to B rock you. I have to agree. Brilliant red sucks. So you have at least my support

2187
02:33:28,240 --> 02:33:29,240
in that game.

2188
02:33:29,240 --> 02:33:34,880
Sephiroth1215 says F you to the UltraMix3 problems and to the 360 hype. Even though

2189
02:33:34,880 --> 02:33:41,880
I'm still getting one at launch. Hey, I'm an equal opportunist gamer and F you to the random Garth Brooks concert during the MTV savings

2190
02:33:43,560 --> 02:33:46,600
That's like that time Loki and I tried to go to Hooters and there was like a random

2191
02:33:46,600 --> 02:33:50,800
There was a very random random audio slave concert in the middle of the street like, you know

2192
02:33:50,900 --> 02:33:55,320
How many how many times did that does that happen to you that you have this just a random?

2193
02:33:55,320 --> 02:33:58,560
Oh, hey, look audio slaves doing a concert in the middle of the street in New York

2194
02:33:58,560 --> 02:34:01,720
They had you two show up and do a concert on a flatbed truck

2195
02:34:01,720 --> 02:34:06,720
That's how they did their all because of you video and you see a bunch of people like taking pictures with their cell phones

2196
02:34:06,720 --> 02:34:08,840
And stuff so I'm like what the hell is you do?

2197
02:34:09,480 --> 02:34:11,360
All right, um

2198
02:34:11,360 --> 02:34:16,320
Let's go ahead and um get to another quick break. You guys are gonna be leaving now, right? Yeah

2199
02:34:16,320 --> 02:34:19,820
I know you got a long drive back. Thank you for coming to the show though and hanging with us. We appreciate it

2200
02:34:19,860 --> 02:34:24,900
Yeah, all right. You guys are cool. We like you. Oh, we like you too final thoughts kids

2201
02:34:26,400 --> 02:34:27,600
No

2202
02:34:27,600 --> 02:34:30,600
I have to take time to think.

2203
02:34:30,600 --> 02:34:35,280
Well gosh man, Ultramix 3, well let's just hope Ultramix 4

2204

I like goodies, thank you very much for the Guitar Hero poster for the studio,

Rock on! Rock on! Peace! Peace, you cool cats!

2224
02:35:29,480 --> 02:35:33,520
We had some requests, so I'm gonna get to those requests, uh, because I'm a nice guy,

2225
02:35:33,520 --> 02:35:36,520
and I'm doing the requests. So we're gonna do just a couple requests, then we're gonna

2226
02:35:36,520 --> 02:35:40,660
come back and, yes, I will open up the Skype line one more time, because some of you guys

2227
02:35:40,660 --> 02:35:44,980
are bitching and moaning that you didn't get through, so we'll give you one more chance.

2228
02:35:44,980 --> 02:35:49,480
So we'll be back after this. Start it off with that four said, uh, dance maniac song

2229
02:35:49,480 --> 02:35:51,480
and some of these FUs. We'll be back.

2230
02:36:19,480 --> 02:36:23,480
Put a little faith in me now

2231
02:36:23,480 --> 02:36:26,480
Put a little trust in me somehow

2232
02:36:26,480 --> 02:36:30,480
Cause when I hold you I'm half a pound

2233
02:36:30,480 --> 02:36:33,480
Now there's more than a feeling

2234
02:36:33,480 --> 02:36:36,480
In my mind, but in my dreams

2235
02:36:36,480 --> 02:36:40,480
You will love me to be somebody

2236
02:36:40,480 --> 02:36:43,480
But in my heart I can feel

2237
02:36:43,480 --> 02:36:48,480
You will take me to be somebody

2238
02:36:48,480 --> 02:36:52,480
I wanna make you love me forever

2239
02:36:52,480 --> 02:37:00,480
Come on hold me, hold me

My name is Fuck Yeah

2245
02:37:29,640 --> 02:37:36,640
I can't lie, I can't lie, I can't take it, I can't lie

2246
02:37:59,640 --> 02:38:04,640
I could notudes to I could notudes to

2247
02:38:04,640 --> 02:38:23,660

I could notudes to

2249
02:39:26,640 --> 02:39:45,000
This is the way we dance, this is the way we rock, this is the way we vibe, as we demonstrate,

2250
02:39:45,000 --> 02:39:46,800
As we demonstrate, straight

2251
02:39:46,800 --> 02:39:48,600
Everybody wants a piece of the pie

2252
02:39:48,600 --> 02:39:50,200
Both of me that meets the eye

2253
02:39:50,200 --> 02:39:52,000
Cause I love when I grab it and I do the fight

2254
02:39:52,000 --> 02:39:54,000
Cause I spy, and it's fly

2255
02:39:54,000 --> 02:39:55,400
This is the way we dance

2256
02:39:55,400 --> 02:39:56,600
This is the way we rock

2257
02:39:56,600 --> 02:39:58,000
This is the way we ride

2258
02:39:58,000 --> 02:39:59,400
As we demonstrate

2259
02:39:59,400 --> 02:40:01,400
As we demonstrate

2260
02:40:18,200 --> 02:40:20,200
This just sounds

2261
02:40:20,840 --> 02:40:22,840
This just sounds

2262
02:40:22,840 --> 02:40:24,440
Everybody wants a piece of the pie

2263
02:40:24,440 --> 02:40:26,040
Water me like Mr. I

2264
02:40:26,040 --> 02:40:27,320
Coz I lose when I cover the eye

2265
02:40:27,320 --> 02:40:29,000
Don't wanna fight coz I spy

2266
02:40:29,000 --> 02:40:44,780
This is the way we dance, this is the way we rock.

2267
02:40:44,780 --> 02:40:58,400
This is the way we ride, this is the way we dance.

2268
02:40:58,400 --> 02:41:04,040
OrangeLoungeRadio.com

2269
02:41:04,040 --> 02:41:07,360
Alright kids, we're back here on Orange Lounge Radio, and as promised we will be opening up the

2270
02:41:07,360 --> 02:41:10,600
skype line soon, but we have a couple things we need to get to first.

2271
02:41:10,600 --> 02:41:14,800
One of them being the one and only Xtaphur is here, and

2272
02:41:14,800 --> 02:41:18,680
Xtaphur, you do your own show on the station, believe it or not, I don't know

2273
02:41:18,680 --> 02:41:20,640
why we gave you a show, but you do have one.

2274
02:41:20,640 --> 02:41:23,920
And when is it? It's on Mondays,

2275
02:41:23,920 --> 02:41:30,400
on Mondays at 7 o'clock to 9. Pretty random show. We don't talk about video

2276
02:41:30,400 --> 02:41:37,400
games all too much, but I pretty much open the show to talk about anything.

2277
02:41:37,400 --> 02:41:41,320
Mostly cock-ass and fucking. So it's like The View, but with a bunch of

2278
02:41:41,320 --> 02:41:42,880
perverts. Oh yeah.

2279
02:41:42,880 --> 02:41:47,480
And I try to have guests on the show. Last week, by the way, I gave everybody an

2280
02:41:47,480 --> 02:41:51,300
assignment that nobody has emailed me. What is the assignment?

2281
02:41:51,300 --> 02:41:56,140
The assignment was to watch a sad movie and email me your thoughts on it.

2282
02:41:56,140 --> 02:42:00,620
I told the whole chat room to do it and they have not done it.

2283
02:42:00,620 --> 02:42:01,620
Hurry up!

2284
02:42:01,620 --> 02:42:06,140
I'm going to beat all of your asses tomorrow on my show if you guys don't do that.

2285
02:42:06,140 --> 02:42:09,440
Alright, public spanking for public.

2286
02:42:09,440 --> 02:42:11,820
Tuesday nights on this very station.

2287
02:42:11,820 --> 02:42:13,340
She's only every other week for right now.

2288
02:42:13,340 --> 02:42:17,540
I'm not sure if she's on or off this week because of her being sick.

2289
02:42:17,540 --> 02:42:20,220
I think it's an on week but because she's sick she might be off.

2290
02:42:20,220 --> 02:42:25,020
I don't know, but check out, pump up the volume with the Wonderly Dark Soccer, and of course,

2291
02:42:25,020 --> 02:42:28,780
that's seven o'clock Pacific time, and of course, if you want to always be in the know

2292
02:42:28,780 --> 02:42:34,460
on when we're live and stuff, the best place to be is our LiveJournal community, www.livejournal.com

2293
02:42:34,460 --> 02:42:38,580
slash users slash orange lounge, okay?

2294
02:42:38,580 --> 02:42:42,460
And of course, Wednesday nights is my show, the Rob Roberts show, and yes, even though

2295
02:42:42,460 --> 02:42:45,100
it's Thanksgiving, I'll be doing a show this week.

2296
02:42:45,100 --> 02:42:47,740
It'll be up after Thanksgiving, it's not until Thursday, but I'll still be.

2297
02:42:47,740 --> 02:42:49,580
I'm not going anywhere, so.

2298
02:43:19,580 --> 02:43:25,020
I just have to say that I had to work on Friday, so I didn't get to see it until Friday after

2299
02:43:25,020 --> 02:43:28,300
work after five o'clock.

2300
02:43:28,300 --> 02:43:33,000
We had tried to go to an earlier showing, but all of the showings were sold out, so

2301
02:43:33,000 --> 02:43:37,420
we had to go see the last showing, which was at 11.05.

2302
02:43:37,420 --> 02:43:39,820
Didn't the movie make like $11 billion this weekend?

2303
02:43:39,820 --> 02:43:45,580
You know, it's interesting because their expectations for this film were that it was going to make

2304
02:43:45,580 --> 02:43:51,460
less than the opening of The Prisoner of Azkaban made last year because each Harry Potter film

2305
02:43:51,460 --> 02:43:57,720
has made less than the one before it. However, this was the biggest opening ever for a Harry

2306
02:43:57,720 --> 02:44:03,380
Potter film, also the fourth biggest opening ever in film history for national...

2307
02:44:03,380 --> 02:44:04,380
Pottermania!

2308
02:44:04,380 --> 02:44:06,780
Yeah, and you know, it's worth pointing out...

2309
02:44:06,780 --> 02:44:09,420
Yes, they heard about the Harry Potter in the bathtub scene.

2310
02:44:09,420 --> 02:44:17,420
It's worth pointing out also that of the four movies that are the best openings ever,

2311
02:44:17,420 --> 02:44:22,420
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is the only one that is a winner movie.

2312
02:44:22,420 --> 02:44:29,420
All the other ones are summer films, like Spiderman, and then there was a couple other ones.

2313
02:44:29,420 --> 02:44:31,420
It's the review.

2314
02:44:31,420 --> 02:44:34,420
Anyways, I'm not a Star Wars fan.

2315
02:44:34,420 --> 02:44:44,180
I saw the movie and it is really good, I enjoyed it.

2316
02:44:44,180 --> 02:44:51,460
It fucking annoyed me at the beginning and it was weird because the third one didn't

2317
02:44:51,460 --> 02:44:54,700
annoy me at all for what they left out in the book.

2318
02:44:54,700 --> 02:44:58,220
I loved the film, it was great the whole way through.

2319
02:44:58,220 --> 02:44:59,860
I saw it seven times.

2320
02:44:59,860 --> 02:45:06,340
I saw it in London, you know, it was something that was kind of like a magical experience

2321
02:45:06,340 --> 02:45:12,660
for Christopher, but this one kind of bugged me, I kept on comparing it to the book and

2322
02:45:12,660 --> 02:45:18,680
I don't know, I think it's because they left out so much and I was wanting to see so much

2323
02:45:18,680 --> 02:45:24,040
that I was just, I got so disappointed, but I will say that the second half of the film

2324
02:45:24,040 --> 02:45:27,680
is better than the first and if you're going to watch a movie, it's all about the second

2325
02:45:27,680 --> 02:45:32,900
half film baby it's like so good it gets really good near the end and they do a

2326
02:45:32,900 --> 02:45:37,660
lot of good stuff and it is dark and it did earn its pg-13 rating and whether it

2327
02:45:37,660 --> 02:45:46,020
was for the gratuitous sexual innuendos or the you know dark themes throughout

2328
02:45:46,020 --> 02:45:51,260
the film I don't know if what it was you know why it was rated pg-13 but it was

2329
02:45:51,260 --> 02:45:55,820
rated pg-13 for a reason and it was it was really good I would recommend it

2330
02:45:55,820 --> 02:45:58,880
It's just that they rush through the first half of the film so much that you're like

2331
02:45:59,180 --> 02:46:02,900
Kind of feeling like you're a DD like you can't focus on one particular scene

2332
02:46:02,900 --> 02:46:07,640
You know because they take so much they it's like they wanted to put as much as they could from the book

2333
02:46:07,640 --> 02:46:13,300
But they just couldn't because of time constraints. All right, you know, but it was good. I enjoyed it

2334
02:46:13,300 --> 02:46:19,060
I'm doing it mucho recommend it. All right, so thumbs up thumbs up

2335
02:46:19,060 --> 02:46:21,940
I didn't like I didn't love it, but I liked it a lot

2336
02:46:21,940 --> 02:46:27,940
And I can't wait for the next one, because that was my favorite book.

2337
02:46:27,940 --> 02:46:29,940
Alright, let's see what happens.

2338
02:46:29,940 --> 02:46:39,940
Alright, moving on now, what we're going to do is we are going to go ahead and give DarkSakura another call,

2339
02:46:39,940 --> 02:46:44,940
because she's not able to be here in person tonight, but she does want to talk to us all through the Skype line

2340
02:46:44,940 --> 02:46:47,940
and let us know how she's enjoying the show.

2341
02:46:47,940 --> 02:46:50,940
And then we'll open the Skyplane to the rest of you, because I promised we would.

2342
02:46:50,940 --> 02:46:54,940
And we might have time to squeeze like one more call in before the show's over.

2343
02:47:03,940 --> 02:47:04,940
Hello?

2344
02:47:04,940 --> 02:47:05,940
Hello!

2345
02:47:07,940 --> 02:47:08,940
Jamie?

2346
02:47:10,940 --> 02:47:11,940
Well, it didn't have the...

2347
02:47:11,940 --> 02:47:12,940
She didn't hang up on you?

2348
02:47:12,940 --> 02:47:13,940
No, she didn't hang up.

2349
02:47:13,940 --> 02:47:15,940
Oh, there we are. Hello?

2350
02:47:15,940 --> 02:47:19,940
Can you hear me?

2351
02:47:19,940 --> 02:47:23,940
It's been off since...

2352
02:47:23,940 --> 02:47:27,940
Call us right back.

2353
02:47:27,940 --> 02:47:31,940
I hope she got that part.

2354
02:47:31,940 --> 02:47:35,940
It's like she's not Dark Sakura, she's Dark Sock.

2355
02:47:35,940 --> 02:47:39,940
Hello?

2356
02:47:39,940 --> 02:47:43,940
Coffee cough. Well at least we know we can hear her this time.

2357
02:47:43,940 --> 02:47:49,140
Are you enjoying the show?

2358
02:47:49,140 --> 02:47:54,540
Sort of. Yeah. Well, what's better when I'm there because it's, you know.

2359
02:47:54,540 --> 02:47:59,580
I know. Mel and Melody say hello, of course, and, you know, hope you feel better and stuff.

2360
02:47:59,580 --> 02:48:02,940
Well, I'm not running a fever anymore.

2361
02:48:02,940 --> 02:48:07,100
That's good. They brought you a present. Oh.

2362
02:48:07,100 --> 02:48:09,980
I can't say what it is because it's something I got someone else for their

2363
02:48:09,980 --> 02:48:11,380
birthday who might be listening.

2364
02:48:11,380 --> 02:48:13,820
So it's something.

2365
02:48:13,820 --> 02:48:15,820
I'll send you a private message.

2366
02:48:15,820 --> 02:48:16,580
OK.

2367
02:48:16,580 --> 02:48:18,380
OK.

2368
02:48:18,380 --> 02:48:20,700
You've got 10 minutes left on the show.

2369
02:48:20,700 --> 02:48:21,380
I know.

2370
02:48:21,380 --> 02:48:23,700
Aw, sweetie, feel better.

2371
02:48:23,700 --> 02:48:26,460
Well, is there anything else you want to say to the listeners?

2372
02:48:26,460 --> 02:48:29,620
Give them a final thought of some sorts?

2373
02:48:29,620 --> 02:48:32,900
Um, I like burritos.

2374
02:48:32,900 --> 02:48:34,540
I ate one today.

2375
02:48:34,540 --> 02:48:36,340
Congratulations.

2376
02:48:36,340 --> 02:48:38,060
I don't like lung cookies.

2377
02:48:38,060 --> 02:48:39,420
Don't burritos make me?

2378
02:48:39,420 --> 02:48:40,660
I feel like my cat.

2379
02:48:40,660 --> 02:48:43,100
Don't burritos make you fart, though?

2380
02:48:43,100 --> 02:48:47,860
No, they make me throw up, though. That's the problem I have with burritos. They make me fart like a whole bunch.

2381
02:48:47,860 --> 02:48:52,380
That is new information. Thank you for that. I know what my cat feels like, though.

2382
02:48:52,380 --> 02:48:53,220
I would...

2383
02:48:53,220 --> 02:48:53,980
Oh, go ahead.

2384
02:48:53,980 --> 02:48:58,540
Horkin' up lung cookies is like horkin' up a hairball.

2385
02:48:58,540 --> 02:49:04,340
Oh, God. Oh, I can't even think. Oh, that's horrible. I'm sorry. And I've been getting sympathetic looks from the cat, like, all weekend.

2386
02:49:04,340 --> 02:49:06,980
The cat knows what you're going through.

2387
02:49:06,980 --> 02:49:10,100
Oh, yes. I feel her pain now.

2388
02:49:10,100 --> 02:49:13,500
How was the podcast awards? We didn't get a chance to talk to you a whole lot on

2389
02:49:13,500 --> 02:49:16,900
on the air about that. We can get into more detail next week. But that's why you were

2390
02:49:16,900 --> 02:49:18,620
out last week. How was the podcast awards?

2391
02:49:18,620 --> 02:49:22,640
I saw Adam Curry's hair. He stood a foot away from me.

2392
02:49:22,640 --> 02:49:25,740
That's hot. They didn't let you get on stage the same week?

2393
02:49:25,740 --> 02:49:29,940
He's still hot. And he's like put on muscle.

2394
02:49:29,940 --> 02:49:33,740
Or something. He looks like really good shape. Maybe he's been working out.

2395
02:49:33,740 --> 02:49:38,140
Maybe. But I think now that he's a little older he actually

2396
02:49:38,140 --> 02:49:43,100
looks more handsome than he did back in his, you know, glam look in 80's days.

2397
02:49:43,100 --> 02:49:46,500
Hmm. Did you get to get up on stage?

2398
02:49:46,500 --> 02:49:52,300
No, they didn't let us say anything, so Julie and I just leeched off the buffet.

2399
02:49:52,300 --> 02:49:56,540
Oh, hey, awesome food! It was actually really good food, but

2400
02:49:56,540 --> 02:50:00,300
the thing is that they didn't want to let us in because we didn't have badges. We were like, hey, we won a prize!

2401
02:50:00,300 --> 02:50:04,940
Like, okay, you can come in. Was Adam Curry wearing leather?

2402
02:50:04,940 --> 02:50:11,980
No, he was wearing like a tux, except he didn't have the jacket or the tie and it was sort

2403
02:50:11,980 --> 02:50:13,180
of unbuttoned at the top.

2404
02:50:13,180 --> 02:50:16,500
It was that very casual dressy look.

2405
02:50:16,500 --> 02:50:18,060
What a lazy, lazy bat.

2406
02:50:18,060 --> 02:50:20,060
No, I'm kidding.

2407
02:50:20,060 --> 02:50:29,500
There were people who were dressed in nice clothes, and then people who were sort of

2408
02:50:29,500 --> 02:50:32,860
not so nice like people who were

2409
02:50:32,860 --> 02:50:37,220
wearing like what you wear to like go work out in or something

2410
02:50:37,220 --> 02:50:41,060
now you know if I had gone I would have dressed fabulously if I'd went

2411
02:50:41,060 --> 02:50:44,140
I dressed fabulously so I forgot to put on my boots

2412
02:50:44,140 --> 02:50:47,620
Did you wear your angel wings? No I didn't

2413
02:50:47,620 --> 02:50:52,020
You forgot to put on your boots? You know those really hot black pants I have?

2414
02:50:52,020 --> 02:50:55,820
I'm sorry what? You know those really hot black pants I have? Yes

2415
02:50:55,820 --> 02:51:00,820
I wore those and I wore that shirt that I actually I wore what I wore to the club

2416
02:51:00,820 --> 02:51:03,820
last Friday, the Friday before.

2417
02:51:03,820 --> 02:51:04,820
Awesome.

2418
02:51:04,820 --> 02:51:08,820
Except I didn't have my big red shiny shoes because I actually brought my black boots

2419
02:51:08,820 --> 02:51:11,820
instead but I left them in the trunk so I wore my Doc Martens.

2420
02:51:11,820 --> 02:51:12,820
Okay, okay.

2421
02:51:12,820 --> 02:51:13,820
They were brown.

2422
02:51:13,820 --> 02:51:14,820
I was like hell of a lot of this black.

2423
02:51:14,820 --> 02:51:15,820
Oh look, brown shoes.

2424
02:51:15,820 --> 02:51:17,820
So did you meet any other cool people?

2425
02:51:17,820 --> 02:51:18,820
Are you there?

2426
02:51:18,820 --> 02:51:20,820
Yeah, I did.

2427
02:51:20,820 --> 02:51:30,820
I did. I met a guy named Frank from the Overnightscape, a really cool independent talk show podcast.

2428
02:51:30,820 --> 02:51:32,820
Cool.

2429
02:51:32,820 --> 02:51:44,820
I met a few other people from the general New Jersey area. Pretty cool folks. We hung out there for a while. I actually got interviewed for his podcast as one of the winners.

2430
02:51:44,820 --> 02:51:48,820
I wonder if that's aired yet. We'll have to check that out.

2431
02:51:48,820 --> 02:51:50,820
Probably, he does his nightly.

2432
02:51:50,820 --> 02:51:52,820
Oh my god, that's a lot.

2433
02:51:52,820 --> 02:51:54,820
Yeah, that's a bit much.

2434
02:51:54,820 --> 02:51:58,820
I know. Could you imagine if we tried to do OLR nightly? Oh my god, we'd die.

2435
02:51:58,820 --> 02:51:59,820
We'd have no life.

2436
02:51:59,820 --> 02:52:01,820
Yeah, we don't as it is.

2437
02:52:01,820 --> 02:52:03,820
Well, we're going to wrap up the show pretty soon.

2438
02:52:03,820 --> 02:52:07,820
I promised a couple other people they could get in on Skype, so we're going to call it a show.

2439
02:52:07,820 --> 02:52:08,820
Well, forget that. I'm special.

2440
02:52:08,820 --> 02:52:10,820
I know, I know, but...

2441
02:52:10,820 --> 02:52:15,820
Okay, I suppose I can deign to release some time to NASA.

2442
02:52:15,820 --> 02:52:21,820
Alright, well feel better, okay? Chat room sends much love, but I know you've been lurking in chat, so you can kind of see that, so.

2443
02:52:21,820 --> 02:52:23,820
Yeah, well, as soon as I reconnect.

2444
02:52:23,820 --> 02:52:25,820
Alright. Kisses, and hearts, and stuff.

2445
02:52:25,820 --> 02:52:26,820
Bye.

2446
02:52:26,820 --> 02:52:27,820
Bye.

2447
02:52:27,820 --> 02:52:28,820
Bye.

2448
02:52:28,820 --> 02:52:36,820
Alright. We're going to open up the Sky- we're going to open up the Skype line now, but it's the lightning round, kids. This is the lightning round.

2449
02:52:36,820 --> 02:52:43,820
Put in some thunder here. It's the lightning round of our Skype line being open, because you only get two minutes.

2450
02:52:43,820 --> 02:52:45,820
We're almost out of time.

2451
02:52:45,820 --> 02:52:47,820
That's not thunder, is it?

2452
02:52:47,820 --> 02:52:49,820
Wooooo!

2453
02:52:49,820 --> 02:52:51,820
Alright, here we go.

2454
02:52:51,820 --> 02:52:53,820
That is the worst thunder ever.

2455
02:52:53,820 --> 02:52:46,580
Hi, you're on Orange

2456
02:52:53,820 --> 02:52:55,820
Orange Radio. Hello.

2457
02:52:55,820 --> 02:52:57,820
Obviously I need no introduction.

2458
02:52:57,820 --> 02:52:59,820
You already know who this is.

2459
02:52:59,820 --> 02:53:01,820
Alright, basically

2460
02:53:01,820 --> 02:53:03,820
when I was in the MTV thing

2461
02:53:03,820 --> 02:53:05,820
they are going to be

2462
02:53:05,820 --> 02:53:07,820
the DDR player they're going to be doing it on

2463
02:53:07,820 --> 02:53:09,820
is this cat named Sketch.

2464
02:53:09,820 --> 02:53:11,820
He's one of the best players in the universe.

2465
02:53:11,820 --> 02:53:17,820
No! I mean it in a noun way. Look, there's got this DDR player named Sketch.

2466
02:53:17,820 --> 02:53:20,320
Okay, I'll stop taking away from you in a minute. Go ahead.

2467
02:53:20,320 --> 02:53:24,820
He is... he's a freestyler's... hmm?

2468
02:53:24,820 --> 02:53:28,820
No, go ahead. S versus being a smartass. Keep talking.

2469
02:53:28,820 --> 02:53:30,820
Uh...

2470
02:53:30,820 --> 02:53:32,820
Great. You broke his train.

2471
02:53:32,820 --> 02:53:38,820
As I said, besides that, all they're really gonna focus on is him.

2472
02:53:38,820 --> 02:53:44,260
the only DER player that they shine their cameras on. They just basically asked him

2473
02:53:44,260 --> 02:53:51,260
a few questions about, you know, about how, you know, you know, about how, of his playing

2474
02:53:51,260 --> 02:53:57,580
skills, and apparently they even went as far as making a breakdance on a carpeted floor

2475
02:53:57,580 --> 02:54:04,580
on the stage. Okay. So, pretty much, he will be in an NTV Overdrive special, I think, on

2476
02:54:04,580 --> 02:54:09,580
He will be in an NTV Overdrive special I think on Tuesday.

2477
02:54:09,580 --> 02:54:14,580
But the segment will probably air this Tuesday in that episode of Direct Effect.

2478
02:54:14,580 --> 02:54:19,580
So you'll definitely get a glimpse of him.

2479
02:54:19,580 --> 02:54:21,580
Zaku, am I going to see you on the TiVo?

2480
02:54:21,580 --> 02:54:26,580
So you're probably going to be TiVo, I assume.

2481
02:54:26,580 --> 02:54:29,580
Yeah, I'm gonna do it.

2482
02:54:29,580 --> 02:54:34,580
And basically critique it like you always do with other things.

2483
02:54:34,580 --> 02:54:36,580
We'll see. Are you gonna be on it?

2484
02:54:36,580 --> 02:54:48,580
Another thing. One of the hosts from Direct Effect actually had the gall to walk out of the stage when she refused to do a segment again.

2485
02:54:48,580 --> 02:54:52,580
Yeah, she refused to retake a segment.

2486
02:54:52,580 --> 02:54:54,540
fucking lala basquiz

2487
02:54:54,540 --> 02:54:59,280
the host of direct effect was pretty damn clueless about the arts begin with

2488
02:54:59,280 --> 02:55:03,200
so she was a good what the hell do you know is that that game will be times up

2489
02:55:03,200 --> 02:55:04,080
all right

2490
02:55:04,080 --> 02:55:05,660
next call

2491
02:55:05,660 --> 02:55:10,540
higher order radio who's this pages is just one and one night two minutes

2492
02:55:10,540 --> 02:55:11,700
wrapped it

2493
02:55:11,700 --> 02:55:12,620
related

2494
02:55:12,620 --> 02:55:17,240
say my uh... nephews manages i'd i didn't i'm sorry i didn't feel

2495
02:55:17,240 --> 02:55:20,520
uh... that's okay that or you got you got two minutes go for it

2496
02:55:20,520 --> 02:55:30,120
Yeah, man, my F.U. was Best Buy, because I just started there about a week ago, and now

2497
02:55:30,120 --> 02:55:34,040
they want me to come in at 4 a.m. in the morning on Black Friday.

2498
02:55:34,040 --> 02:55:36,120
Oh my God, are you having to work Tuesday?

2499
02:55:36,120 --> 02:55:37,120
Tuesday.

2500
02:55:37,120 --> 02:55:38,960
The XBox day?

2501
02:55:38,960 --> 02:55:40,960
No, I don't.

2502
02:55:40,960 --> 02:55:41,960
Thank God.

2503
02:55:41,960 --> 02:55:42,960
Yes, yes.

2504
02:55:42,960 --> 02:55:49,400
You'd have to come in at like 3 a.m. to beat people up on the line and stuff or something,

2505
02:55:49,400 --> 02:55:50,520
I don't know.

2506
02:55:50,520 --> 02:55:52,140
Yeah, pretty much.

2507
02:55:52,140 --> 02:55:54,400
Anything else you want to share?

2508
02:55:54,400 --> 02:55:55,580
No, no, no.

2509
02:55:55,580 --> 02:55:58,920
You have a minute ten left before I hang up on you?

2510
02:55:58,920 --> 02:56:02,540
No, I gotta go now. Alright. Well, I want to hang up on you anyway, okay?

2511
02:56:02,540 --> 02:56:05,140
Alright. Alright, there we go. Alright.

2512
02:56:05,140 --> 02:56:06,760
Next up.

2513
02:56:06,760 --> 02:56:10,860
Lightning round, two minutes. What's up? Who's this?

2514
02:56:10,860 --> 02:56:16,860
It's Nintendo X64. Alright, two minutes. What's up?

2515
02:56:16,860 --> 02:56:20,860
Well, first off, Mario Kart DS is, like, really awesome.

2516
02:56:20,860 --> 02:56:21,860
What is?

2517
02:56:21,860 --> 02:56:23,860
Mario Kart DS.

2518
02:56:23,860 --> 02:56:26,860
Okay. Oh, yeah, Mario Kart DS is badass. I love it.

2519
02:56:26,860 --> 02:56:27,860
Yeah.

2520
02:56:27,860 --> 02:56:31,860
And I will get you my friend code. I just, I need a break, so...

2521
02:56:31,860 --> 02:56:32,860
Yeah.

2522
02:56:32,860 --> 02:56:33,860
Alright.

2523
02:56:33,860 --> 02:56:35,860
Hey, Mario, can you give me your friend code, darn it?

2524
02:56:35,860 --> 02:56:38,860
It's on the forums. Oh, yeah, look. Look, we put it on the forums.

2525
02:56:38,860 --> 02:56:39,860
orangeonsider.com

2526
02:56:39,860 --> 02:56:40,860
Okay, cool.

2527
02:56:40,860 --> 02:56:43,860
I'm afraid of the stalkers more than he is.

2528
02:56:43,860 --> 02:56:44,860
Okay.

2529
02:56:44,860 --> 02:56:46,860
Alright, a minute twenty, what else is on your mind?

2530
02:56:46,860 --> 02:56:51,860
Uh, I score as a DDR club now, which is like, pretty cool. Yeah.

2531
02:56:51,860 --> 02:56:53,860
Cool? Where's that at?

2532
02:56:53,860 --> 02:56:55,860
Uh, at my school.

2533
02:56:55,860 --> 02:56:58,860
Alright. Well, is this like high school, college, or what?

2534
02:56:58,860 --> 02:56:59,860
Yeah, high school.

2535
02:56:59,860 --> 02:57:00,860
Alright, awesome.

2536
02:57:00,860 --> 02:57:01,860
We put her in FIO.

2537
02:57:01,860 --> 02:57:02,860
Okay.

2538
02:57:02,860 --> 02:57:08,860
Yeah, and, not even so, I've only done two rounds of DDR, instead of three. Yeah.

2539
02:57:08,860 --> 02:57:13,860
Are you guys, are you guys gonna be, uh, bringing Ultramix 3 into your club?

2540
02:57:13,860 --> 02:57:14,980
uh...

2541
02:57:14,980 --> 02:57:17,740
really have no clothes.

2542
02:57:17,740 --> 02:57:19,920

Alright.

2544
02:57:21,620 --> 02:57:23,100
Forty-five seconds.

02:57:23,100 --> 02:57:29,420
So I'm still, I'm not the worst person, actually there's other person that's like, I don't think I've ever worked with a person before.

2546
02:57:29,420 --> 02:57:33,140
Well maybe they're just joining the DDR club because they want to get fit.

2547
02:57:33,140 --> 02:57:36,020
Maybe. Who knows.

2548
02:57:36,020 --> 02:57:40,580
Well, what other events do you guys have planned in the DDR club?

2549
02:57:40,580 --> 02:57:42,900

2556
02:57:58,380 --> 02:58:00,580

02:58:00,580 --> 02:58:03,860
two tv's so we didn't have two going on

2558
02:58:03,860 --> 02:58:05,100

three, two, one

2560
02:58:06,340 --> 02:58:07,820

2561
02:58:07,820 --> 02:58:09,180
