00:05:34,354 --> 00:05:34,594
[SPEAKER_32]: All right.

62
00:05:37,154 --> 00:05:37,815
[SPEAKER_32]: All right, anyway.

63
00:05:37,835 --> 00:05:39,615
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh, also Bugs, Bugs is here.

64
00:05:40,216 --> 00:05:41,017
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you for watching!

65
00:05:58,089 --> 00:05:58,329
[SPEAKER_32]: Weird.

66
00:05:58,849 --> 00:05:59,450
[SPEAKER_32]: And I don't snore.

67
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:00,250
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright.

68
00:06:00,991 --> 00:06:01,351
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright.

69
00:06:02,472 --> 00:06:13,138
[SPEAKER_32]: Anyway, kids, what we're going to do, since it is a very special day here in the Bomani world, we're going to start off tonight by taking a real quick break to bring you a song.

70
00:06:14,219 --> 00:06:17,360
[SPEAKER_32]: And we'll come back and we're going to get into some music from Ultimix 3 as well.

71
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:21,863
[SPEAKER_32]: But of course, because it is 20 November, you know we have to start off tonight with this song.

72
00:06:21,903 --> 00:06:24,885
[SPEAKER_32]: So here it is, 20 November, and we'll be back right after this.

73
00:07:29,525 --> 00:07:31,609
Thank you for watching!

74
00:07:44,232 --> 00:07:46,113
[SPEAKER_32]: All right, we're back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

75
00:07:46,153 --> 00:07:47,493
[SPEAKER_32]: We're going to get into some music, though.

76
00:07:47,653 --> 00:07:50,254
[SPEAKER_32]: Now, see, that was just a special thing because it is 20 November.

77
00:07:50,294 --> 00:07:50,734
[SPEAKER_32]: We have to.

78
00:07:50,954 --> 00:07:53,875
[SPEAKER_32]: And we will give a happy belated 19 November later in the show.

79
00:07:53,935 --> 00:07:56,856
[SPEAKER_32]: But since it is kind of the Bomani holiday, I have no idea why.

80
00:07:57,236 --> 00:07:57,916
[SPEAKER_32]: Well, I do know why.

81
00:07:58,376 --> 00:08:01,597
[SPEAKER_32]: It's this big stupid thing that everybody, you know, recognizes in this scene.

82
00:08:01,637 --> 00:08:02,117
[SPEAKER_32]: So whatever.

83
00:08:02,557 --> 00:08:02,958
[SPEAKER_32]: There you go.

84
00:08:03,978 --> 00:08:06,759
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay, so we're going to get into some music, though, from Ultramix 3.

85
00:08:06,979 --> 00:08:07,639
[SPEAKER_32]: And I'll tell you what.

86
00:08:07,699 --> 00:08:10,720
[SPEAKER_32]: First thing I'm going to say about Ultramix 3, before we even really get into the show,

87
00:08:11,441 --> 00:08:14,230
[SPEAKER_32]: it's got a very interesting song list a very

88
00:08:16,408 --> 00:08:18,289
[SPEAKER_32]: Special song list, if you will.

89
00:08:18,689 --> 00:08:20,190
[SPEAKER_32]: It's definitely diverse.

90
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:21,010
[SPEAKER_32]: We'll give it that.

91
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:26,252
[SPEAKER_31]: So we're going to be playing... Special, like, special school bus, wearing the helmet special.

92
00:08:26,392 --> 00:08:27,192
[SPEAKER_32]: It's all kinds of special.

93
00:08:27,472 --> 00:08:32,094
[SPEAKER_32]: So we will be playing music from Ultimix 3 throughout tonight's show for you guys, and you be the judge.

94
00:08:32,114 --> 00:08:35,336
[SPEAKER_32]: We're going to play the good stuff and the bad stuff and the downright ugly stuff.

95
00:08:35,356 --> 00:08:36,396
[SPEAKER_32]: We're going to play it all tonight.

96
00:08:37,076 --> 00:08:40,358
[SPEAKER_32]: And the stuff that you guys like, we'll keep in rotation on our Bomani Music More.

97
00:08:40,378 --> 00:08:43,219
[SPEAKER_32]: But the stuff that's just like, what the fuck, we will...

98
00:08:44,105 --> 00:08:45,665
[SPEAKER_32]: Get Rid Of, and Never Play Again.

99
00:08:46,366 --> 00:08:53,328
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright, so, in this break we're going to start off, we're going to play, in this break, a track by Orifiz with Basile.

100
00:08:53,368 --> 00:08:56,509
[SPEAKER_32]: They were in the last Ultramix game, so this should be interesting.

101
00:08:56,929 --> 00:08:58,949
[SPEAKER_32]: We're going to play a song called Come With Me.

102
00:08:58,989 --> 00:09:00,990
[SPEAKER_32]: It's not the same one from the V-Rare, though.

103
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:05,211
[SPEAKER_32]: It's by Yahil and Tammy, so it's the other Come With Me we're going to play in this break.

104
00:09:05,631 --> 00:09:08,052
[SPEAKER_32]: And then we're going to play Black Eyed Peas.

105
00:09:08,092 --> 00:09:10,573
[SPEAKER_32]: Black Eyed Peas have a brand new song in this Ultramix.

106
00:09:11,073 --> 00:09:11,693
[SPEAKER_32]: Shall we dance?

107
00:09:11,733 --> 00:09:12,754
[SPEAKER_32]: I can make of nothing I'd like better

133
00:16:01,793 --> 00:16:03,594
[SPEAKER_32]: I've heard intimations about it.

134
00:16:03,854 --> 00:16:05,154
[SPEAKER_32]: I can't say much about it.

135
00:16:05,174 --> 00:16:05,855
[SPEAKER_32]: I don't know how much.

136
00:16:05,935 --> 00:16:08,716
[SPEAKER_32]: I might have said too much, but it's out there publicly.

137
00:16:08,776 --> 00:16:11,197
[SPEAKER_32]: Anybody can find it, so it's there.

138
00:16:11,217 --> 00:16:12,117
[SPEAKER_32]: It's going to launch soon.

139
00:16:12,697 --> 00:16:13,898
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah, I've heard.

140
00:16:14,498 --> 00:16:19,640
[SPEAKER_38]: I've talked to people within the company about it, but I think that anyone else couldn't speculate on it.

141
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:20,541
[SPEAKER_38]: It's got to be on the download.

142
00:16:20,581 --> 00:16:20,801
[SPEAKER_38]: I know.

143
00:16:20,921 --> 00:16:21,761
[SPEAKER_38]: I feel you.

144
00:16:21,821 --> 00:16:25,223
[SPEAKER_38]: I got noses out there in every direction finding this stuff out.

145
00:16:25,463 --> 00:16:25,843
[SPEAKER_38]: It's all good.

146
00:16:26,043 --> 00:16:31,225
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah, the cool thing, actually, just back on T-shirt real quick, this is actually the first prize I ever won in a DDR tournament.

147
00:16:32,148 --> 00:16:34,169
[SPEAKER_38]: This is the end of Freestyle back in SoCal.

148
00:16:34,189 --> 00:16:36,390
[SPEAKER_38]: I think it was 2000, Santa Monica Pier Tourney.

149
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:38,931
[SPEAKER_38]: And there were only like three t-shirts given out.

150
00:16:38,951 --> 00:16:42,253
[SPEAKER_38]: And I think overall, of people I know in the community, there are only like five.

151
00:16:43,193 --> 00:16:43,674
[SPEAKER_32]: Wow.

152
00:16:44,274 --> 00:16:46,755
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah, I'm one of the special Fab Five.

153
00:16:47,195 --> 00:16:52,098
[SPEAKER_32]: Now, I have to ask you really quickly before we get into the other stuff in the show.

154
00:16:52,538 --> 00:16:54,639
[SPEAKER_32]: Did you listen to this week's podcast that we do?

155
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:56,700
[SPEAKER_32]: Yes, as a matter of fact, I did.

156
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:57,881
[SPEAKER_32]: What did you think about...

157
00:16:58,581 --> 00:16:59,001
[SPEAKER_32]: www.darksakura.com

158
00:17:17,113 --> 00:17:20,295
[SPEAKER_32]: Badum, you got your own internet movie database page.

159
00:17:20,555 --> 00:17:21,676
[SPEAKER_38]: I had no idea.

160
00:17:21,856 --> 00:17:29,140
[SPEAKER_38]: I mean, people talk about being, you know, some sort of internet celebrity or whatever, but being on IMDb, that's a whole different sort of freaky.

161
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,262
[SPEAKER_38]: And they still can't even spell my last name right.

162
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:33,923
[SPEAKER_32]: Is your last name spelled wrong on there?

163
00:17:34,183 --> 00:17:36,144
[SPEAKER_38]: Yes, I do not have an H in my last name.

164
00:17:36,224 --> 00:17:38,985
[SPEAKER_38]: I don't know why people assume there is, but eh.

165
00:17:39,746 --> 00:17:39,866
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh.

166
00:17:40,182 --> 00:17:40,743
[SPEAKER_38]: Shark's Girl Melody

167
00:17:58,447 --> 00:18:01,628
[SPEAKER_32]: Now, tell us about this fundraiser you're a part of.

168
00:18:01,968 --> 00:18:07,571
[SPEAKER_32]: I know this is a big part of your life lately, and I'm just curious.

169
00:18:09,371 --> 00:18:25,898
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, I decided in May, actually, that I was going to look into joining the team in training through the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society to walk a marathon, and at that point in time, I was literally waiting for E3, the day of the meeting, and things weren't working out time-wise, so I thought, okay, I'll join the fall season.

170
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:33,141
[SPEAKER_27]: So I went back in July and started training on July 31st, and I've been training for a marathon.

171
00:18:33,161 --> 00:18:37,948
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm going to be walking 26.2 miles, hopefully, on December 11th in Honolulu.

172
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:45,376
[SPEAKER_27]: and I'm up to, I've raised $3,675 so far for leukemia and lymphoma research.

173
00:18:45,636 --> 00:18:46,857
[SPEAKER_32]: Wow, that's amazing.

174
00:18:46,937 --> 00:18:51,061
[SPEAKER_32]: Now, if folks want to donate more, because you can go above and beyond, right?

175
00:18:51,081 --> 00:18:52,602
[SPEAKER_32]: Do we have a link we can give or something?

176
00:18:52,662 --> 00:18:57,066
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm actually over my total, but I'm taking everything anyone's willing to give me, even if it's just a dollar or two.

177
00:18:57,547 --> 00:19:03,071
[SPEAKER_27]: The best thing to do is go to livejournal.com slash user slash melathon, M-E-L-A-T-O-N.

178
00:19:03,812 --> 00:19:04,352
[SPEAKER_27]: How do you spell it?

179
00:19:04,372 --> 00:19:05,493
[SPEAKER_27]: It's like marathon only with Mel.

180
00:19:05,653 --> 00:19:06,353
[SPEAKER_32]: Melathon.

181
00:19:06,413 --> 00:19:07,734
[SPEAKER_27]: I can't even think of how to spell it myself.

182
00:19:07,754 --> 00:19:08,674
[SPEAKER_27]: That's kind of sad.

183
00:19:08,854 --> 00:19:09,194
[SPEAKER_32]: How about this?

184
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:10,635
[SPEAKER_32]: M-E-L-A-T-H-O-N.

185
00:19:10,795 --> 00:19:11,135
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you.

186
00:19:11,215 --> 00:19:11,575
[SPEAKER_32]: You're welcome.

187
00:19:11,935 --> 00:19:15,056
[SPEAKER_27]: So, yeah, that's pretty much been my life lately.

188
00:19:15,076 --> 00:19:18,478
[SPEAKER_27]: I was supposed to walk 22 miles yesterday.

189
00:19:18,598 --> 00:19:23,059
[SPEAKER_27]: I did 12 because on Tuesday I fell and ran my knee into a curb.

190
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:26,641
[SPEAKER_27]: And it's very lovely and pretty multicolors.

191
00:19:27,141 --> 00:19:27,441
[SPEAKER_27]: Ouch.

192
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:32,764
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, it's kind of put a damper in a thing since I'm three weeks out from the marathon.

193
00:19:32,924 --> 00:19:38,189
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, that's... I've got a backup plan in place and my coach is not that worried.

194
00:19:38,269 --> 00:19:40,791
[SPEAKER_32]: Now, did you use DDR for any of your stamina training?

195
00:19:41,672 --> 00:19:45,215
[SPEAKER_27]: Just the background that I already had because he actually yelled at me not to do anything else.

196
00:19:45,255 --> 00:19:46,216
[SPEAKER_27]: Really?

197
00:19:46,296 --> 00:19:50,539
[SPEAKER_27]: For fear of hurting myself, which instead I go and I walk and run into a curb.

198
00:19:50,719 --> 00:19:51,480
[SPEAKER_32]: You know I had to ask.

199
00:19:52,301 --> 00:19:53,522
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah, you all had to ask.

200
00:19:53,682 --> 00:19:55,724
[SPEAKER_27]: Actually, I haven't turned on my DDR machine and...

201
00:19:56,502 --> 00:20:03,184
[SPEAKER_32]: Theoretically, this show is about DDR and music games and stuff, so I have to bring it up once in a while to interject the idea.

202
00:20:03,544 --> 00:20:06,885
[SPEAKER_32]: The illusion that we actually play DDR once in a while still.

203
00:20:06,905 --> 00:20:08,545
[SPEAKER_27]: There you go.

204
00:20:09,186 --> 00:20:10,306
[SPEAKER_27]: So that's been most of my life.

205
00:20:10,446 --> 00:20:17,568
[SPEAKER_27]: Every Saturday, the most I've walked at one time is 15 miles straight, and that took about five hours, I think.

206
00:20:17,768 --> 00:20:17,988
[SPEAKER_32]: Wow.

207
00:20:18,607 --> 00:20:21,608
[SPEAKER_32]: I need time to go shop and then say hey I want that and go back.

208
00:20:43,683 --> 00:20:56,867
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright, um, what we're gonna do now, um, we're gonna try, now we tried to get DarkSakura on the show in the beginning, but unfortunately our Skype was going a little bit crazy, so I'm going to try and, uh, get DarkSakura back on the line here.

209
00:20:57,788 --> 00:20:59,468
[SPEAKER_32]: So, let's see if we have any luck here.

210
00:20:59,488 --> 00:21:00,488
[SPEAKER_32]: I gotta bring up Skype.

211
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:06,750
[SPEAKER_32]: That's weird.

212
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:08,831
[SPEAKER_32]: It almost sounds like it's calling her actual phone phone.

213
00:21:10,192 --> 00:21:10,532
[SPEAKER_32]: Let's see.

214
00:21:10,612 --> 00:21:11,392
[SPEAKER_32]: Do-do-do-do-do-do.

215
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:13,840
[SPEAKER_32]: One ringy dingy dingy.

216
00:21:18,262 --> 00:21:19,263
[SPEAKER_21]: Hello?

217
00:21:19,763 --> 00:21:20,303
[SPEAKER_32]: Hello?

218
00:21:23,165 --> 00:21:23,645
[SPEAKER_32]: Hello?

219
00:21:24,986 --> 00:21:25,586
[SPEAKER_32]: That was weird.

220
00:21:25,646 --> 00:21:27,687
[SPEAKER_32]: It sounded all phantom-y when she came on.

221
00:21:27,947 --> 00:21:28,508
[SPEAKER_32]: Hello?

222
00:21:28,588 --> 00:21:29,508
[SPEAKER_32]: Like all broken up.

223
00:21:29,548 --> 00:21:29,988
[SPEAKER_32]: That's weird.

224
00:21:30,469 --> 00:21:32,230
[SPEAKER_32]: Do we have any other stuff going?

225
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:35,892
[SPEAKER_32]: Let me lower our bandwidth here.

226
00:21:35,932 --> 00:21:36,912
[SPEAKER_32]: Live radio, everybody.

227
00:21:36,932 --> 00:21:38,253
[SPEAKER_32]: This stuff happens once in a while.

228
00:21:38,273 --> 00:21:40,094
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm just trying to kill any excess bandwidth we have.

229
00:21:41,334 --> 00:21:42,115
[SPEAKER_32]: Can you hear us, Jamie?

230
00:21:42,135 --> 00:21:42,235
[SPEAKER_32]: Jamie?

231
00:21:44,693 --> 00:21:45,694
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah, can you hear me?

232
00:21:46,354 --> 00:21:51,237
[SPEAKER_32]: There, okay, we've got her a little bit there, we just got a really bad delay there, but that's alright, we can deal with that.

233
00:21:52,378 --> 00:21:53,858
[SPEAKER_32]: DarkSakura, what's going on?

234
00:21:53,918 --> 00:21:54,939
[SPEAKER_32]: How are you doing?

235
00:21:54,979 --> 00:22:05,285
[SPEAKER_32]: You're kind of sick, I know, but... I thought it was... Hello?

236
00:22:05,906 --> 00:22:07,727
[SPEAKER_32]: Hi, what's going on, DarkSakura?

237
00:22:07,947 --> 00:22:08,827
[SPEAKER_11]: I just closed IRC.

238
00:22:08,867 --> 00:22:09,308
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, okay.

239
00:22:09,768 --> 00:22:09,988
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay.

240
00:22:11,856 --> 00:22:18,938
[SPEAKER_11]: They thought I had pneumonia, and it turns out to be a really bad case of bronchitis.

241
00:22:19,478 --> 00:22:20,919
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm really sick.

242
00:22:20,939 --> 00:22:24,260
[SPEAKER_32]: I spent most of the week sick, and it started getting better.

243
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,140
[SPEAKER_32]: I went to the doctor on Monday.

244
00:22:42,211 --> 00:23:04,009
[SPEAKER_11]: and I started getting better around Wednesday, Thursday and then I had a bad relapse on Friday and my boss basically sent me to the doctor right away and he x-rayed and I have some fluid in my lungs but not enough to qualify as full-blown pneumonia so they're treating me for severe bronchitis.

245
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:09,453
[SPEAKER_32]: Still, either way, bronchitis or pneumonia, no fun at all, I imagine, so...

246
00:23:10,632 --> 00:23:11,192
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the Muppet Show!

247
00:23:38,407 --> 00:23:41,589
[SPEAKER_32]: See, this is Jamie's week in a nutshell, unfortunately, is the Muppet Show here.

248
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:45,171
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, and not doing my homework until the weekend.

249
00:23:46,152 --> 00:23:48,533
[SPEAKER_32]: Don't you get a bye from your homework, though, when you're sick?

250
00:23:49,174 --> 00:23:51,235
[SPEAKER_11]: No, unfortunately.

251
00:23:52,035 --> 00:23:58,299
[SPEAKER_32]: Some of my classes are online, so I don't necessarily... Your professors are evil for not letting you have a bye on your homework.

252
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:03,042
[SPEAKER_11]: One of my teachers is giving us a week off for Thanksgiving in one of my online classes.

253
00:24:03,923 --> 00:24:05,844
[SPEAKER_32]: Now, what are your plans for Thanksgiving?

254
00:24:05,904 --> 00:24:07,365
[SPEAKER_32]: Is this going to get in the way of Thanksgiving?

255
00:24:08,135 --> 00:24:15,482
[SPEAKER_11]: I have no idea, but I'm tired of being stuck in the house, because I had to miss going to see Chemical Angel on Saturday.

256
00:24:16,864 --> 00:24:26,534
[SPEAKER_11]: I missed the show tonight, and I missed seeing my friend, one of my old co-workers who moved to Delaware was in town today, and I missed my chance to see her.

257
00:24:27,675 --> 00:24:29,156
[SPEAKER_11]: So we did talk on the phone for a little bit.

258
00:24:29,436 --> 00:24:30,898
[SPEAKER_32]: Well, that's something, okay.

259
00:24:32,538 --> 00:24:36,020
[SPEAKER_11]: But, it's just been bleh.

260
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,701
[SPEAKER_11]: I slept 17 hours yesterday.

261
00:24:37,721 --> 00:24:38,862
[SPEAKER_32]: I had a cold.

262
00:24:38,882 --> 00:24:40,523
[SPEAKER_32]: This is what my cold turned into.

263
00:24:40,583 --> 00:24:41,023
[SPEAKER_32]: That's sucky.

264
00:24:41,043 --> 00:24:42,324
[SPEAKER_32]: When do the doctors think you'll be better?

265
00:25:01,339 --> 00:25:07,483
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know, but he put me on, I was on Keflex, which is kind of a mild antibiotic.

266
00:25:08,163 --> 00:25:13,406
[SPEAKER_11]: That was for the sinus infection, and then once he found out just how bad it was, he put me on doxycycline.

267
00:25:14,787 --> 00:25:17,608
[SPEAKER_11]: Which is, from what I understand, supposed to be pretty hardcore stuff.

268
00:25:18,129 --> 00:25:18,429
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

269
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:24,192
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, so he gave me a seven day supply, but I'm going to see how I feel.

270
00:25:24,352 --> 00:25:26,313
[SPEAKER_11]: It's helping some, I'm getting a little better.

271
00:25:26,594 --> 00:25:27,134
[SPEAKER_32]: That's good.

272
00:25:27,154 --> 00:25:28,975
[SPEAKER_11]: I have to go back to work tomorrow.

273
00:25:29,481 --> 00:25:29,941
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh, gosh.

274
00:25:30,001 --> 00:25:31,922
[SPEAKER_32]: I hope you get a lot better by Thursday.

275
00:25:31,942 --> 00:25:33,142
[SPEAKER_32]: At least this is short work week.

276
00:25:33,262 --> 00:25:35,242
[SPEAKER_32]: I mean, there's something to look forward to there, a little bit.

277
00:25:36,662 --> 00:25:37,043
[SPEAKER_32]: I guess.

278
00:25:38,123 --> 00:25:38,863
[SPEAKER_32]: What else was I going to ask?

279
00:25:38,943 --> 00:25:43,764
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh, before, you know, we're going to go around the room and see how everybody else's weekend day was, but I wanted to ask, what were your thoughts?

280
00:25:43,784 --> 00:25:47,264
[SPEAKER_32]: I know you haven't had a chance to play games, so you haven't had a chance to check out Ultramix 3 yet.

281
00:25:47,665 --> 00:25:49,205
[SPEAKER_32]: What do you think of the music so far, though?

282
00:25:51,245 --> 00:25:52,445
[SPEAKER_11]: I wouldn't be the one to ask.

283
00:25:52,466 --> 00:25:53,506
[SPEAKER_11]: I haven't been paying attention.

284
00:25:53,566 --> 00:25:54,786
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been either...

285
00:25:55,322 --> 00:25:56,583
[SPEAKER_11]: Passed out or doing homework.

286
00:25:56,783 --> 00:25:57,304
[SPEAKER_32]: That's all right.

287
00:25:57,404 --> 00:25:58,044
[SPEAKER_32]: It's understandable.

288
00:25:58,585 --> 00:26:01,347
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay, well, Jamie, what we're going to do, we're going to go back around the room.

289
00:26:01,367 --> 00:26:03,889
[SPEAKER_32]: We'll bring you back later in the show, though, for some of our other stuff, okay?

290
00:26:03,909 --> 00:26:04,909
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

291
00:26:05,069 --> 00:26:05,750
[SPEAKER_32]: All right, take care.

292
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:06,230
[SPEAKER_32]: Rest up.

293
00:26:07,631 --> 00:26:07,932
[SPEAKER_32]: All right.

294
00:26:07,992 --> 00:26:11,174
[SPEAKER_32]: All right, any final words for the listeners for right now?

295
00:26:12,135 --> 00:26:12,835
[SPEAKER_11]: Send me money.

296
00:26:13,236 --> 00:26:14,837
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay, we will do.

297
00:26:14,857 --> 00:26:16,158
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

298
00:26:16,238 --> 00:26:17,059
[SPEAKER_32]: All right, bye.

299
00:26:17,239 --> 00:26:17,759
[SPEAKER_32]: Bye.

300
00:26:17,959 --> 00:26:18,540
[SPEAKER_32]: Bye now.

301
00:26:19,485 --> 00:26:21,266
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright, we'll bring her back on the show a little later.

302
00:26:21,346 --> 00:26:29,292
[SPEAKER_32]: She feels bad because she wasn't here last week and she's been out, but obviously she's got to rest up, so we hope she gets better very soon.

303
00:26:29,813 --> 00:26:33,115
[SPEAKER_32]: Well, let's go around the room and see how other folks are having their day and their week.

304
00:26:33,296 --> 00:26:37,819
[SPEAKER_32]: We'll start with Angel, because she's over there just lounging around there with the microphone, ready to go.

305
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:39,640
[SPEAKER_25]: What's up?

306
00:26:40,281 --> 00:26:40,741
[SPEAKER_32]: How was your week?

307
00:26:40,761 --> 00:26:42,703
[SPEAKER_25]: How was your day?

308
00:26:42,763 --> 00:26:42,943
[SPEAKER_25]: Good.

309
00:26:44,104 --> 00:26:47,606
[SPEAKER_25]: I did something I said I wasn't going to do, and you're going to laugh now.

310
00:26:47,927 --> 00:26:48,307
[SPEAKER_10]: What's that?

311
00:26:48,743 --> 00:26:50,104
[SPEAKER_25]: I rolled Alliance.

312
00:26:51,885 --> 00:26:52,186
[SPEAKER_32]: Wait.

313
00:26:52,666 --> 00:26:54,788
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh, you joined an alliance on World of Warcraft.

314
00:26:54,888 --> 00:26:56,029
[SPEAKER_25]: I rolled Alliance.

315
00:26:56,069 --> 00:26:58,631
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, I rolled an Alliance character on a different server.

316
00:26:58,991 --> 00:26:59,391
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh, okay.

317
00:26:59,431 --> 00:26:59,872
[SPEAKER_32]: What server?

318
00:27:00,712 --> 00:27:01,293
[SPEAKER_25]: Malfurion.

319
00:27:01,753 --> 00:27:02,033
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay.

320
00:27:03,154 --> 00:27:07,557
[SPEAKER_25]: Um, it's... Okay.

321
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:09,599
[SPEAKER_38]: Okay.

322
00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:10,720
[SPEAKER_38]: He's never gonna laugh.

323
00:27:11,781 --> 00:27:12,161
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah.

324
00:27:12,661 --> 00:27:13,862
[SPEAKER_32]: Well, anyway...

325
00:27:17,332 --> 00:27:18,513
[SPEAKER_32]: Careful, that microphone's the weird one.

326
00:27:18,533 --> 00:27:20,294
[SPEAKER_32]: You gotta make sure you're... Yeah, it's weird.

327
00:27:20,694 --> 00:27:21,574
[SPEAKER_25]: It doesn't like me.

328
00:27:21,594 --> 00:27:22,075
[SPEAKER_32]: There you go.

329
00:27:22,155 --> 00:27:22,695
[SPEAKER_25]: There you go.

330
00:27:23,115 --> 00:27:23,455
[SPEAKER_25]: Yay.

331
00:27:23,676 --> 00:27:24,536
[SPEAKER_25]: Yay for wiring.

332
00:27:24,776 --> 00:27:30,079
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, so... Yeah, so I said I wasn't gonna do it, and then I did.

333
00:27:30,379 --> 00:27:37,743
[SPEAKER_25]: So, I don't know, everything's weird now, because I'm so used to, like, playing Horde and stuff, so... So now you're having to play as the bad guy.

334
00:27:38,924 --> 00:27:43,166
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, actually, yeah.

335
00:27:43,186 --> 00:27:43,747
[SPEAKER_25]: In a way.

336
00:27:43,767 --> 00:27:45,067
[SPEAKER_32]: Or what else have you been playing this week?

337
00:27:45,107 --> 00:27:46,168
[SPEAKER_32]: Not just World of Warcraft, but...

338
00:27:47,757 --> 00:27:52,599
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, uh, um, yeah, Guitar Hero, because I just got that tool.

339
00:27:52,859 --> 00:27:53,099
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah?

340
00:27:53,159 --> 00:27:54,540
[SPEAKER_32]: How's Guitar Hero working out for you?

341
00:27:55,260 --> 00:28:01,943
[SPEAKER_25]: Uh, sometimes the notes go too fast, but if I concentrate on what's going where, everything's cool.

342
00:28:01,983 --> 00:28:03,884
[SPEAKER_25]: So, what else did we get this week?

343
00:28:04,004 --> 00:28:05,964
[SPEAKER_32]: What do you think about Guitar Hero compared to Guitar Freaks?

344
00:28:07,985 --> 00:28:14,968
[SPEAKER_25]: Um, I haven't, I didn't get to play Guitar Freaks that much, because, you know, when I first started coming up here and stuff with you guys...

345
00:28:15,774 --> 00:28:17,055
[SPEAKER_25]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

346
00:28:35,875 --> 00:28:39,899
[SPEAKER_25]: All is good, but I still like my World of Warcraft Have you been on Mario Kart Frenzy this week?

347
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:51,849
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes, I got to play with Slinky and BigRandPimp and DJ Ranma S and just, you know, all of my buddies, it's fun The online thing is crazy, isn't it?

348
00:28:52,009 --> 00:28:54,892
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes it is, and there's no lag, at least I don't think

349
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:56,360
[SPEAKER_25]: Is there lag?

350
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:57,041
[SPEAKER_32]: No, not really.

351
00:28:57,061 --> 00:28:57,641
[SPEAKER_32]: I don't notice it.

352
00:28:58,361 --> 00:28:58,661
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah.

353
00:28:58,681 --> 00:28:59,062
[SPEAKER_32]: It's great.

354
00:28:59,202 --> 00:29:05,044
[SPEAKER_25]: So, I've been doing a lot of gaming this week when I should be concentrating on school, which I'm doing too.

355
00:29:05,885 --> 00:29:07,886
[SPEAKER_25]: But gaming's much more fun.

356
00:29:08,186 --> 00:29:08,946
[SPEAKER_32]: Especially this week.

357
00:29:08,966 --> 00:29:11,067
[SPEAKER_32]: This is such a big week with all the releases that came out last week.

358
00:29:11,087 --> 00:29:11,848
[SPEAKER_25]: All the games.

359
00:29:12,468 --> 00:29:14,889
[SPEAKER_32]: Going into next week and the 360 and all that crap.

360
00:29:15,509 --> 00:29:16,890
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't even have a PSP yet.

361
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:17,871
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh well.

362
00:29:17,951 --> 00:29:18,231
[SPEAKER_25]: Soon.

363
00:29:18,551 --> 00:29:18,971
[SPEAKER_32]: Anything else?

364
00:29:19,411 --> 00:29:19,671
[SPEAKER_25]: No.

365
00:29:19,972 --> 00:29:20,212
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright.

366
00:29:20,272 --> 00:29:21,012
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't think so.

367
00:29:22,233 --> 00:29:23,253
[SPEAKER_25]: I feel like a bat.

368
00:29:25,709 --> 00:29:25,969
[SPEAKER_32]: Angel, wake up!

369
00:29:26,069 --> 00:29:26,730
[SPEAKER_32]: Angel, wake up!

370
00:29:46,713 --> 00:29:49,035
[SPEAKER_38]: I actually have to learn some basic braille.

371
00:29:49,055 --> 00:29:52,078
[SPEAKER_38]: Or you have to learn to write really big.

372
00:29:52,118 --> 00:29:55,422
[SPEAKER_38]: Actually, instead of that, what we do is I write audio scripts for stuff.

373
00:29:55,442 --> 00:29:57,243
[SPEAKER_38]: Say for a math problem, there's a

374
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:14,845
[SPEAKER_38]: Drawing of a triangle, which is like, you know, four or five, you know, whatever the Pythagorean triple is.

375
00:30:15,346 --> 00:30:17,790
[SPEAKER_38]: But the thing is, of course, obviously a blind person can't see that.

376
00:30:18,311 --> 00:30:21,656
[SPEAKER_38]: And, you know, you can't necessarily make like a raised diagram for them to feel around.

377
00:30:21,716 --> 00:30:23,379
[SPEAKER_38]: So you actually have to write the description like,

378
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,681
[SPEAKER_38]: There is a triangle, ABC.

379
00:30:26,161 --> 00:30:31,564
[SPEAKER_38]: You know, B is a right angle, and, you know, side AB equals 4, and BC equals 5, you know, by this logic.

380
00:30:31,584 --> 00:30:32,264
[SPEAKER_38]: That's hard!

381
00:30:32,785 --> 00:30:34,386
[SPEAKER_38]: It's so hard to do, and you can't see.

382
00:30:34,946 --> 00:30:42,190
[SPEAKER_38]: It's really like a, kind of a crash course in articulation, and, like, basically, you're kind of thinking, well, if someone was from another planet, how would you describe all this stuff to them?

383
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:42,630
[SPEAKER_38]: So it's...

384
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,801
[SPEAKER_32]: How would you describe DDR to somebody who is visually impaired?

385
00:30:50,704 --> 00:30:53,966
[SPEAKER_32]: There is loud Japanese Eurobeat music playing.

386
00:30:54,826 --> 00:30:58,748
[SPEAKER_32]: There are arrows slowly crawling up the screen.

387
00:30:58,988 --> 00:31:02,070
[SPEAKER_27]: But if you're visually impaired, how do you know what an arrow is?

388
00:31:03,852 --> 00:31:06,434
[SPEAKER_32]: Easy, all the time.

389
00:31:07,094 --> 00:31:13,357
[SPEAKER_32]: There is somebody dancing on a pad with arrows and the pad lights up when they step on it.

390
00:31:13,938 --> 00:31:17,960
[SPEAKER_32]: This person looks really gay playing this game.

391
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:20,842
[SPEAKER_32]: Shut up, Rob.

392
00:31:20,862 --> 00:31:33,189
[SPEAKER_32]: This person is holding on to a bar that is pink in color with a black top that has since been ripped off by little six-year-old shits at Golf Land.

393
00:31:37,475 --> 00:31:38,876
[SPEAKER_32]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

394
00:31:59,665 --> 00:32:16,595
[SPEAKER_38]: Oh, actually, the Create a Wrestler mode has been around since, like, I think, a couple versions ago, but this time they've gotten even more detailed with things, like, you know, this time you can customize your entrance, like, you know, different types of, you can have, like, fireworks go off, you know, at certain points, or you can, like,

395
00:32:16,915 --> 00:32:21,397
[SPEAKER_38]: Have the camera pan around to someone else or, you know, all sorts of... That's great.

396
00:32:21,417 --> 00:32:24,599
[SPEAKER_38]: You can do the techno, you know, lighting, all sorts of things.

397
00:32:24,619 --> 00:32:30,062
[SPEAKER_32]: The game makes you spend, like, an hour coming up with a perfect introduction and, like, no time on the actual game.

398
00:32:30,122 --> 00:32:31,082
[SPEAKER_32]: I'll put it like this.

399
00:32:31,262 --> 00:32:34,024
[SPEAKER_38]: When I was making my first character, it took me about three and a half hours.

400
00:32:34,044 --> 00:32:34,684
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, my God.

401
00:32:35,104 --> 00:32:43,929
[SPEAKER_38]: You know, that's... But that's because not only are you making the character, but because it's a new game, you want to see what new types of hairstyles or, like, clothes you could put on people, so...

402
00:32:44,389 --> 00:32:47,490
[SPEAKER_38]: It's just exploration, really, but it's still pretty damn fun.

403
00:32:47,850 --> 00:32:51,552
[SPEAKER_32]: That's kind of like Soul Calibur III has a make-a-fighter mode.

404
00:32:51,592 --> 00:32:53,172
[SPEAKER_32]: It's pretty intensive, too.

405
00:32:53,592 --> 00:32:58,834
[SPEAKER_32]: But you don't get to do your intro, which is too bad, because Soul Calibur III practically has wrestling intros.

406
00:32:58,854 --> 00:33:04,116
[SPEAKER_32]: It's like, the soul will burn as two entrants come for the next battle.

407
00:33:04,996 --> 00:33:08,818
[SPEAKER_21]: I shall destroy you with every inch of my being!

408
00:33:09,670 --> 00:33:11,571
[SPEAKER_21]: Do we have to fight now?

409
00:33:12,072 --> 00:33:14,253
[SPEAKER_32]: Let there be a great battle!

410
00:33:15,234 --> 00:33:19,597
[SPEAKER_32]: Swear to God, Soul Calibur goes on and on with the setups of these fights.

411
00:33:20,958 --> 00:33:27,043
[SPEAKER_25]: Rob, you would do a good intro for the next World of Warcraft thing?

412
00:33:27,283 --> 00:33:29,264
[SPEAKER_32]: I should be Soul Calibur 4, it's all about me.

413
00:33:29,865 --> 00:33:34,028
[SPEAKER_31]: I am the Pencils Pope, you killed my father, prefer to die!

414
00:33:36,129 --> 00:33:36,630
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright...

415
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:39,672
[SPEAKER_38]: Anyway, sorry, I keep cutting you off, buddy

416
00:34:01,823 --> 00:34:03,044
[SPEAKER_38]: But it's still pretty cool.

417
00:34:03,064 --> 00:34:07,546
[SPEAKER_38]: I think the most fun though is just creating the characters and like, you know, making mockeries of all your friends.

418
00:34:08,026 --> 00:34:09,807
[SPEAKER_38]: You know, that's the fun of it.

419
00:34:09,847 --> 00:34:12,489
[SPEAKER_32]: Making characters that look like your friends and then kicking the shit out of them.

420
00:34:12,789 --> 00:34:14,090
[SPEAKER_38]: That's what we do essentially.

421
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:16,311
[SPEAKER_38]: Everybody in like RTF and Step Squad.

422
00:34:16,791 --> 00:34:18,612
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah, we just have like these big get-togethers.

423
00:34:19,252 --> 00:34:22,494
[SPEAKER_32]: I make my characters in Soul Calibur 3 look really, really faggy.

424
00:34:22,574 --> 00:34:23,274
[SPEAKER_32]: Like the best I can.

425
00:34:23,535 --> 00:34:27,717
[SPEAKER_32]: Like I gave one a pope hat and a clown necklace and no pants.

426
00:34:29,645 --> 00:34:33,507
[SPEAKER_32]: And he's wearing like a little jockstrap or something where I swear you can like see his ass.

427
00:34:34,888 --> 00:34:35,588
[SPEAKER_32]: And it's purple.

428
00:34:36,248 --> 00:34:37,149
[SPEAKER_16]: For no real reason.

429
00:34:37,169 --> 00:34:39,250
[SPEAKER_32]: I gotta see this character.

430
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:39,690
[SPEAKER_38]: It's great.

431
00:34:39,790 --> 00:34:41,931
[SPEAKER_38]: I love creating a character in Soul Calibur 3.

432
00:34:41,971 --> 00:34:43,092
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah, let's see.

433
00:34:43,112 --> 00:34:43,752
[SPEAKER_38]: What else?

434
00:34:43,812 --> 00:34:47,434
[SPEAKER_38]: Guitar Hero, obviously, has been also getting a lot of playtime.

435
00:34:47,634 --> 00:34:48,594
[SPEAKER_38]: That's pretty fun.

436
00:34:48,814 --> 00:34:50,595
[SPEAKER_38]: And, uh, let's see.

437
00:34:50,735 --> 00:34:53,657
[SPEAKER_38]: And, uh, yeah, those are pretty much the two main games I've been playing this week.

438
00:34:54,397 --> 00:34:56,678
[SPEAKER_38]: And, yeah, everything's been pretty good all together.

439
00:34:56,718 --> 00:34:58,179
[SPEAKER_38]: And today, hey, I'm here, you know.

440
00:34:59,003 --> 00:34:59,503
[SPEAKER_38]: 20 November.

441
00:35:00,884 --> 00:35:01,184
[SPEAKER_38]: All right.

442
00:35:02,365 --> 00:35:03,445
[SPEAKER_38]: Shark's Girl, how was your week?

443
00:35:03,465 --> 00:35:03,885
[SPEAKER_32]: How was your day?

444
00:35:04,746 --> 00:35:10,868
[SPEAKER_27]: My week has been the same as every week for the last, I don't know how many, I walked a lot.

445
00:35:11,709 --> 00:35:14,170
[SPEAKER_27]: God, I've probably done over 250 miles at this point.

446
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:15,090
[SPEAKER_32]: Keep you healthy, though.

447
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:15,470
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh, yeah.

448
00:35:15,491 --> 00:35:16,091
[SPEAKER_27]: I've lost a lot of weight.

449
00:35:16,111 --> 00:35:17,111
[SPEAKER_32]: I should be training for a marathon.

450
00:35:17,131 --> 00:35:17,591
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, it's great.

451
00:35:17,992 --> 00:35:19,512
[SPEAKER_27]: But, yeah, I worked.

452
00:35:20,073 --> 00:35:20,633
[SPEAKER_27]: I walked.

453
00:35:20,693 --> 00:35:23,854
[SPEAKER_27]: I actually went to a store called Sur La Table.

454
00:35:23,894 --> 00:35:27,696
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't know if anyone else, I don't know if it's a Bay Area thing or if it's nationwide or what.

455
00:35:28,103 --> 00:35:32,367
[SPEAKER_27]: But it's one of those places where it's like a cooking utensil store, but they also have like a kitchen and stuff.

456
00:35:33,288 --> 00:35:36,751
[SPEAKER_27]: And my work hired it out and brought a bunch of people we work with in.

457
00:35:36,771 --> 00:35:40,135
[SPEAKER_27]: There were like 40 people there, and we all drank wine and made food.

458
00:35:40,655 --> 00:35:41,716
[SPEAKER_27]: And it was really entertaining.

459
00:35:42,517 --> 00:35:46,341
[SPEAKER_27]: And I now have a really good recipe for petite beef wellingtons if anyone wants it.

460
00:35:46,941 --> 00:35:48,143
[SPEAKER_27]: But yes, I did that.

461
00:35:48,203 --> 00:35:48,623
[SPEAKER_27]: I walked.

462
00:35:49,371 --> 00:35:50,411
[SPEAKER_27]: and aforementioned walking.

463
00:35:51,672 --> 00:35:55,773
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm very, very lucky because the one game I have been playing a lot of is Guitar Hero.

464
00:35:56,133 --> 00:35:58,393
[SPEAKER_27]: And I was carrying my guitar when I fell.

465
00:35:59,234 --> 00:36:03,775
[SPEAKER_27]: And I'm just lucky the back of it hit the curb and took chunks out of it versus the front or the buttons.

466
00:36:04,055 --> 00:36:04,595
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh, yeah.

467
00:36:04,635 --> 00:36:08,836
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah, so... Wait, how did you fall with a Guitar Hero controller?

468
00:36:08,936 --> 00:36:10,377
[SPEAKER_32]: I was... You know I have to ask.

469
00:36:10,497 --> 00:36:12,557
[SPEAKER_27]: I was holding a bunch of stuff.

470
00:36:12,597 --> 00:36:14,318
[SPEAKER_27]: I was going to my car from Mel's.

471
00:36:14,378 --> 00:36:15,018
[SPEAKER_27]: It was like 11.30 at night.

472
00:36:16,722 --> 00:36:46,185
[SPEAKER_27]: and I was wearing my heels from work which I don't wear like skinny ones but still they're heels so I had my Guitar Hero controller slung around my no I was holding the neck of it in my left hand I had my purse up there and I was holding something else in my right hand I stepped up on a curb and I think I stepped onto a rock and it turned out from underneath me and I went straight down next thing I know I'm like why am I on the ground and then Mel's looking at me like why are you on the ground and then it hits me that the best thing to do in this situation would be curse loudly so I did and

473
00:36:46,744 --> 00:36:53,588
[SPEAKER_27]: Probably scared the shit out of the neighbors, and yeah, so, yeah, the Guitar Hero controller hit the ground right next to me.

474
00:36:54,429 --> 00:36:57,671
[SPEAKER_27]: So, I have a few little gouges out of the back of it, but it still plays.

475
00:36:57,791 --> 00:36:59,772
[SPEAKER_32]: But as long as it works, that's the important part.

476
00:36:59,792 --> 00:37:00,032
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, yeah.

477
00:37:00,312 --> 00:37:01,513
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, it still works, trust me.

478
00:37:02,654 --> 00:37:03,995
[SPEAKER_32]: Anything else you want to share about your week and your day?

479
00:37:06,356 --> 00:37:07,657
[SPEAKER_32]: Have you been doing the Mario Kart thing?

480
00:37:07,997 --> 00:37:09,678
[SPEAKER_27]: No.

481
00:37:09,738 --> 00:37:12,340
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, this is when you kick me out of the house.

482
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:13,801
[SPEAKER_32]: No, I'm not going to kick you out of the house.

483
00:37:13,861 --> 00:37:15,582
[SPEAKER_27]: I've never played Mario Kart ever.

484
00:37:18,078 --> 00:37:20,640
[SPEAKER_27]: The look of stunned silence is amazing.

485
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:22,522
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm sorry, I have to point and laugh.

486
00:37:24,804 --> 00:37:26,325
[SPEAKER_32]: How did that happen?

487
00:37:26,365 --> 00:37:27,486
[SPEAKER_32]: You just not interested?

488
00:37:28,007 --> 00:37:34,052
[SPEAKER_27]: I just never really got into it, and none of my friends really had it, so I didn't have exposure to it that way.

489
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:36,514
[SPEAKER_27]: And now you're handing me a DS with Mario Kart?

490
00:37:36,534 --> 00:37:38,455
[SPEAKER_27]: I was just telling Mel that I need to play it.

491
00:37:38,475 --> 00:37:38,856
[SPEAKER_27]: Play me!

492
00:37:38,956 --> 00:37:39,937
[SPEAKER_27]: Play me, Mel!

493
00:37:39,997 --> 00:37:41,998
[SPEAKER_27]: His DS is telling me to play it.

494
00:37:42,199 --> 00:37:42,559
Play!

495
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:43,800
[SPEAKER_32]: There you go.

496
00:37:44,281 --> 00:37:47,782
[SPEAKER_25]: Actually, mine is also sitting over there, so you can play.

497
00:37:48,523 --> 00:38:01,429
[SPEAKER_27]: So, yeah, pretty much my week has been walking, and everything is going to be walking up until December 11th, upon which at night it's party and collapse, and then it's hang out in Hawaii time, and then life returns to normal.

498
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:02,790
[SPEAKER_32]: All right.

499
00:38:02,830 --> 00:38:02,910
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah.

500
00:38:03,342 --> 00:38:03,682
[SPEAKER_27]: That was it.

501
00:38:04,062 --> 00:38:04,902
[SPEAKER_32]: Sounds good.

502
00:38:04,922 --> 00:38:11,564
[SPEAKER_32]: Now, what's this part about how I'm going to be joining you in Hawaii, how you actually got me a ticket and was going to surprise me on the show with it tonight?

503
00:38:11,884 --> 00:38:12,565
[SPEAKER_32]: What was this about?

504
00:38:12,785 --> 00:38:16,126
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, darn, you ruined the surprise, damn it.

505
00:38:17,286 --> 00:38:21,787
[SPEAKER_32]: Maybe next year, maybe next year I'll train, but it's a lot of time.

506
00:38:21,867 --> 00:38:28,629
[SPEAKER_27]: It is a lot of time, but honestly, it's one of the best experiences I've ever had in my life, and I'm so close with all these people that I've been training with.

507
00:38:28,749 --> 00:38:32,110
[SPEAKER_27]: It's a big commitment, but it's totally worth it.

508
00:38:32,622 --> 00:38:35,485
[SPEAKER_27]: And if anyone wants to talk to me about it, go ahead and email me, find me.

509
00:38:35,685 --> 00:38:37,327
[SPEAKER_27]: I'll put a post on Orange Lounge or something.

510
00:38:37,587 --> 00:38:38,027
[SPEAKER_32]: Sounds good.

511
00:38:38,207 --> 00:38:38,408
[SPEAKER_32]: Cool.

512
00:38:38,548 --> 00:38:38,828
[SPEAKER_31]: All right.

513
00:38:39,248 --> 00:38:40,129
[SPEAKER_31]: Loki, how was your week?

514
00:38:40,149 --> 00:38:40,510
[SPEAKER_31]: How was your day?

515
00:38:42,351 --> 00:38:43,673
[SPEAKER_31]: My week was good until today.

516
00:38:44,754 --> 00:38:48,277
[SPEAKER_31]: Or actually, I should say, yeah, yeah, until about today.

517
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:57,306
[SPEAKER_31]: Last week, because I hadn't gotten an oil change in forever, I decided to go and get an oil change for my car.

518
00:38:58,499 --> 00:39:02,505
[SPEAKER_31]: And like luck as it would be, they fucked up my car again.

519
00:39:02,525 --> 00:39:05,691
[SPEAKER_32]: If this isn't the same place that wrecked your old car, thank god.

520
00:39:05,731 --> 00:39:08,976
[SPEAKER_31]: Different place, different car, still fucking stuff up.

521
00:39:09,363 --> 00:39:14,525
[SPEAKER_31]: So now my car leaks coolant and overheats thanks to them.

522
00:39:14,905 --> 00:39:16,625
[SPEAKER_31]: And so now I got to get that fixed.

523
00:39:17,065 --> 00:39:18,126
[SPEAKER_31]: I got to take work off.

524
00:39:18,566 --> 00:39:19,646
[SPEAKER_31]: It's just a pain in the ass.

525
00:39:19,986 --> 00:39:20,526
[SPEAKER_31]: It really is.

526
00:39:22,367 --> 00:39:28,529
[SPEAKER_31]: However, aside from that, because my whole week's been kind of doing the roller coaster ride of highs and lows.

527
00:39:28,989 --> 00:39:37,631
[SPEAKER_31]: Last night we went to the strip club, and that was kind of fun, because we had titties in our face all night, and lap dances, and so Nelly had a pretty good time.

528
00:39:38,931 --> 00:39:44,072
[SPEAKER_31]: And then, I don't know, that was pretty much it, yeah, that was the highlights of the week.

529
00:39:44,432 --> 00:39:58,115
[SPEAKER_31]: Oh, I have Xbox 360 games and no Xbox system, and GameStop was wonderful and decided to go ahead and sell my copy of Project Gotham Racing, even though I had a pre-order for it, and came there, showed them my receipt, and they're like, uh, oops.

530
00:40:02,921 --> 00:40:07,967
[SPEAKER_31]: And then I got a recorded message saying, You're not going to get your system until after Christmas!

531
00:40:08,328 --> 00:40:11,712
[SPEAKER_31]: Which, you know, that's based on their current allocations of what they're going to get.

532
00:40:12,874 --> 00:40:15,877
[SPEAKER_31]: But it's just going to be a big giant circus this week.

533
00:40:16,458 --> 00:40:16,598
[SPEAKER_31]: So...

534
00:40:17,392 --> 00:40:18,993
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm looking forward to completely ignoring

535
00:40:37,586 --> 00:40:46,993
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm freaking addicted already You said you've been playing all week and I have not run into you once I haven't touched World of Warcraft in five days I know

536
00:41:07,867 --> 00:41:13,712
[SPEAKER_32]: I actually got to play the Mario Kart arcade version yesterday.

537
00:41:27,535 --> 00:41:28,675
[SPEAKER_38]: at Milpitas Golf Land.

538
00:41:28,695 --> 00:41:29,975
[SPEAKER_38]: It's actually pretty fun.

539
00:41:29,996 --> 00:41:34,216
[SPEAKER_38]: They got not only Nintendo, but Namco also was in on it.

540
00:41:34,616 --> 00:41:36,477
[SPEAKER_38]: So now you can write as Pac-Man, Ms.

541
00:41:36,517 --> 00:41:37,497
[SPEAKER_38]: Pac-Man, or Blinky.

542
00:41:37,957 --> 00:41:38,577
[SPEAKER_32]: I heard about that.

543
00:41:38,597 --> 00:41:39,417
[SPEAKER_32]: That's so badass.

544
00:41:39,697 --> 00:41:41,038
[SPEAKER_32]: So they have that at Milpitas Golf Land?

545
00:41:41,118 --> 00:41:41,458
[SPEAKER_38]: Yes, they do.

546
00:41:41,478 --> 00:41:44,098
[SPEAKER_38]: The only thing that sucks is they don't have card readers.

547
00:41:44,898 --> 00:41:53,000
[SPEAKER_38]: And it's like, oh, actually, in a way, it's bad, but it's good, too, because if there was a card reader, I probably would have dropped like 20 bucks yesterday.

548
00:41:53,587 --> 00:42:00,432
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay, so I'm going to a birthday party in Hayward, like, in two weeks, so now I'm gonna have to swing by Milpitas, even though that's, like, an hour drive, I don't care.

549
00:42:00,512 --> 00:42:01,713
[SPEAKER_32]: About two weeks?

550
00:42:01,733 --> 00:42:03,875
[SPEAKER_32]: Like, the first of December or something, it's like a Friday.

551
00:42:04,075 --> 00:42:04,875
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah, I'll definitely let you know.

552
00:42:05,115 --> 00:42:05,456
[SPEAKER_32]: Absolutely.

553
00:42:06,617 --> 00:42:06,897
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright.

554
00:42:06,917 --> 00:42:07,097
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah.

555
00:42:07,297 --> 00:42:13,422
[SPEAKER_38]: The only, like, drawback to this is you can't totally, I mean, the power sliding isn't, like, totally there, but you can do, like, jump drifts.

556
00:42:13,642 --> 00:42:13,842
[SPEAKER_32]: Hmm.

557
00:42:14,181 --> 00:42:16,682
[SPEAKER_38]: So, you know, it's a little different, but they have, like, all the courses there.

558
00:42:16,702 --> 00:42:19,343
[SPEAKER_32]: You can do the jump drifts in this, too, kind of use that same thing, yeah.

559
00:42:19,363 --> 00:42:22,744
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah, where you, like, dig into the gas and you hit the brake and then, yeah, you can do that.

560
00:42:22,764 --> 00:42:23,265
[SPEAKER_32]: Sort of, sort of.

561
00:42:23,285 --> 00:42:25,826
[SPEAKER_32]: And this one you wiggle back and forth after you do a jump, yeah.

562
00:42:26,066 --> 00:42:26,366
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh, wow.

563
00:42:26,406 --> 00:42:27,066
[SPEAKER_32]: It's kind of interesting.

564
00:42:27,586 --> 00:42:28,127
[SPEAKER_32]: So, anyway.

565
00:42:28,707 --> 00:42:30,247
[SPEAKER_32]: All right, we're going to go to another break.

566
00:42:30,608 --> 00:42:32,468
[SPEAKER_32]: I want to talk a lot about Ultramix 3 tonight.

567
00:42:32,548 --> 00:42:34,829
[SPEAKER_32]: I know you guys have your opinions you want to state, too.

568
00:42:35,049 --> 00:42:36,310
[SPEAKER_32]: We're going to get to all of that.

569
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:39,533
[SPEAKER_32]: Right after this next break, but we need to take a break because I need something to drink.

570
00:42:39,993 --> 00:42:40,614
[SPEAKER_32]: Something stiff.

571
00:42:41,094 --> 00:42:43,957
[SPEAKER_32]: In this break, we're going to hear some more Ultramix 3 music.

572
00:42:44,057 --> 00:42:46,559
[SPEAKER_32]: In this break, we're going to hear I Am Gothic, because I love this song.

573
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:47,900
[SPEAKER_32]: Where's Your Head At?

574
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:48,941

[SPEAKER_32]: Nari Narin by J. Dobby.

576
00:42:51,964 --> 00:42:53,826
[SPEAKER_32]: It's a little bit of a Bollywood type.

577
00:42:53,866 --> 00:42:54,406
[SPEAKER_32]: It's kind of cool.

578
00:42:54,667 --> 00:42:57,930
[SPEAKER_32]: And then Stakeout, the Ultramix by Freeze Pop.

579
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:59,211
[SPEAKER_32]: So we're going to hear all that this break.

590
00:50:05,756 --> 00:50:07,396
[SPEAKER_32]: Which, by the way, has a very freaky video.

591
00:50:07,456 --> 00:50:09,097
[SPEAKER_32]: It's in that mix.

592
00:50:09,697 --> 00:50:13,859
[SPEAKER_32]: Nari Nari by J. Dobby and Stakeout, the Ultra Mix by Freeze Pop.

593
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:18,401
[SPEAKER_32]: I don't want to say too much, but please keep your fingers crossed for me.

594
00:50:19,201 --> 00:50:21,982
[SPEAKER_32]: I got a contact over at Freeze Pop, and I'm trying to get them on the show.

595
00:50:22,302 --> 00:50:26,884
[SPEAKER_32]: So, please pray to whatever deity that we can get them on the show, because I love Freeze Pop.

596
00:50:26,904 --> 00:50:28,465
[SPEAKER_32]: I would love to have them on the program.

597
00:50:28,505 --> 00:50:31,166
[SPEAKER_32]: And if anybody out there from the Freeze Pop camp is listening, please come

598
00:50:33,307 --> 00:50:36,929
[SPEAKER_27]: We made our freaks look so uber chic.

599
00:50:38,030 --> 00:50:38,871
[SPEAKER_32]: We shop at Target.

600
00:50:40,171 --> 00:50:41,172
[SPEAKER_32]: Trust me, no, seriously.

601
00:50:41,372 --> 00:50:43,473
[SPEAKER_32]: I shop so much at Target.

602
00:50:43,513 --> 00:50:44,274
[SPEAKER_32]: It's disgusting.

603
00:50:44,314 --> 00:50:45,995
[SPEAKER_32]: Probably this whole house is furnished with Target.

604
00:50:46,555 --> 00:50:50,598
[SPEAKER_27]: The thing with Target that reminds me is the sad news about Vanilla Coke's passing.

605
00:50:50,718 --> 00:50:57,622
[SPEAKER_27]: I can remember going to a Target with you and finding every damn bottle of Vanilla Coke they had and buying it when it first came out.

606
00:50:58,703 --> 00:51:01,925
[SPEAKER_32]: I have that picture in my cubicle at work.

607
00:51:02,605 --> 00:51:03,646
[SPEAKER_32]: It makes me sad.

608
00:51:03,666 --> 00:51:06,807
[SPEAKER_32]: I'll have to put that next to the picture of me as a toddler with Crystal Pepsi.

609
00:51:07,308 --> 00:51:07,668
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm kidding.

610
00:51:08,248 --> 00:51:08,428
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright.

611
00:51:08,448 --> 00:51:08,508
[SPEAKER_32]: Rob!

612
00:51:13,402 --> 00:51:13,682
[SPEAKER_21]: What?

613
00:51:13,702 --> 00:51:15,343
[SPEAKER_21]: I drank that stuff, too.

614
00:51:15,784 --> 00:51:16,144
[SPEAKER_32]: No, I know.

615
00:51:16,184 --> 00:51:16,404
[SPEAKER_32]: I did.

616
00:51:16,464 --> 00:51:17,244
[SPEAKER_32]: I wasn't a toddler.

617
00:51:17,645 --> 00:51:19,926
[SPEAKER_32]: That shit was out when we were in, what, junior high or so?

618
00:51:19,946 --> 00:51:20,767
[SPEAKER_27]: We're about the same age.

619
00:51:20,807 --> 00:51:21,887
[SPEAKER_27]: I used to drink it all the time.

620
00:51:23,008 --> 00:51:25,409
[SPEAKER_25]: Don't forget, I'm not that much younger than you are.

621
00:51:26,710 --> 00:51:27,010
[SPEAKER_25]: Sir.

622
00:51:28,351 --> 00:51:29,672
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm getting yelled at by the chat room.

623
00:51:29,812 --> 00:51:32,134
[SPEAKER_32]: Chat room, by the way, www.orangesoundtrader.com.

624
00:51:32,154 --> 00:51:32,714
[SPEAKER_32]: Click on chat.

625
00:51:33,234 --> 00:51:35,376
[SPEAKER_32]: MPQ says, Stop saying Tar-jay.

626
00:51:35,736 --> 00:51:39,498
[SPEAKER_32]: Hey, it's better than the new one I've started hearing recently because all my friends shop there.

627
00:51:39,518 --> 00:51:39,798
[SPEAKER_32]: Tar-gay.

628
00:51:39,818 --> 00:51:40,339
[SPEAKER_32]: Tar-gay.

629
00:51:43,148 --> 00:51:44,669
[SPEAKER_32]: So if you want, buddy.

630
00:51:45,309 --> 00:51:45,809
[SPEAKER_32]: No, all right.

631
00:51:45,869 --> 00:51:46,830
[SPEAKER_32]: We all know it's Target.

632
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:47,891
[SPEAKER_32]: We all know it's Target.

633
00:51:47,991 --> 00:51:49,071
[SPEAKER_32]: But I like that Target.

634
00:51:49,872 --> 00:51:50,572
[SPEAKER_27]: It makes it sound chic.

635
00:51:50,692 --> 00:51:53,294
[SPEAKER_32]: It makes it sound like Saks Fifth Target.

636
00:51:53,694 --> 00:51:54,134
[SPEAKER_32]: It's great.

637
00:51:54,834 --> 00:51:56,215
[SPEAKER_27]: We have to feel upper class, okay?

638
00:51:56,315 --> 00:51:56,956
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah, I know.

639
00:51:57,356 --> 00:51:58,476
[SPEAKER_27]: At least it's not Kmartay.

640
00:52:00,748 --> 00:52:06,412
[SPEAKER_32]: Kmart is like, you heard that Martha Stewart was thinking about buying Kmart and they were going to call it K-Martha.

641
00:52:07,833 --> 00:52:08,894
[SPEAKER_22]: That's not a fucking joke.

642
00:52:08,914 --> 00:52:09,834
[SPEAKER_22]: That's not a fucking joke.

643
00:52:11,656 --> 00:52:14,778
[SPEAKER_32]: But they're having like this huge sale and anyway, it's just ghetto.

644
00:52:14,898 --> 00:52:15,758
[SPEAKER_32]: Kmart's ghetto.

645
00:52:15,778 --> 00:52:17,079
[SPEAKER_32]: Why would Martha Stewart want to buy Kmart?

646
00:52:17,099 --> 00:52:17,900
[SPEAKER_32]: Kmart is ghetto.

647
00:52:18,399 --> 00:52:20,040
[SPEAKER_32]: and I'll see you next time.

648
00:52:35,851 --> 00:52:37,592
[SPEAKER_32]: DGR Ultramix 3

649
00:52:56,996 --> 00:52:57,437
[SPEAKER_32]: No, I'm kidding.

650
00:52:57,457 --> 00:53:00,161
[SPEAKER_32]: There's actually a lot to like about Ultima 3.

651
00:53:00,201 --> 00:53:01,062
[SPEAKER_32]: I like Xbox Live.

652
00:53:01,403 --> 00:53:02,485
[SPEAKER_32]: Xbox Live is a lot cleaner.

653
00:53:02,845 --> 00:53:03,987
[SPEAKER_32]: It's a lot better, I think.

654
00:53:04,468 --> 00:53:07,272
[SPEAKER_32]: I like the fact that you can send messages to people within Xbox Live.

655
00:53:07,592 --> 00:53:10,657
[SPEAKER_32]: I like how you don't have to quit out of the game and come back in to...

656
00:53:12,219 --> 00:53:15,661
[SPEAKER_32]: Download new stuff that the new content stuff is integrated into the game.

657
00:53:15,881 --> 00:53:23,105
[SPEAKER_32]: I think they did a very good job with that and sending the messages back to each other and seeing who all is online playing the game, not necessarily in your room.

658
00:53:23,425 --> 00:53:24,306
[SPEAKER_32]: I think that's all great.

659
00:53:24,386 --> 00:53:26,667
[SPEAKER_32]: So the Xbox Live portion looks great.

660
00:53:26,787 --> 00:53:27,027
[SPEAKER_32]: Love it.

661
00:53:28,008 --> 00:53:28,628
[SPEAKER_32]: Song list.

662
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:30,480
[SPEAKER_32]: It's half and half for me.

663
00:53:30,881 --> 00:53:32,862
[SPEAKER_32]: There's some awesome stuff in the song list.

664
00:53:32,942 --> 00:53:36,003
[SPEAKER_32]: I love the spray song.

665
00:53:36,063 --> 00:53:37,564
[SPEAKER_32]: I love the real life song.

666
00:53:37,604 --> 00:53:39,085
[SPEAKER_32]: I love the gothy and trancy stuff.

667
00:53:39,125 --> 00:53:39,845
[SPEAKER_32]: I always do, though.

668
00:53:40,325 --> 00:53:44,547
[SPEAKER_32]: And then I love some of the stuff that they brought over from other Bomani stuff.

669
00:53:44,727 --> 00:53:46,408
[SPEAKER_32]: Like Right on Time from Guitar Freaks is great.

670
00:53:46,448 --> 00:53:48,349
[SPEAKER_32]: Himawari from Guitar Freaks is well.

671
00:53:50,190 --> 00:53:53,832
[SPEAKER_32]: Parade of the Wooden Soldiers, WTF, but that's kind of neat.

672
00:53:54,572 --> 00:53:56,713
[SPEAKER_32]: Akumajo Dracula Medley, of course, was an awesome pick.

673
00:53:56,993 --> 00:53:57,834
[SPEAKER_32]: They picked some good stuff.

674
00:53:58,274 --> 00:54:27,849
[SPEAKER_32]: but then the song list kind of goes weird for me because they tried with the song list in Ultramix 3 to be much more eclectic and that is very obvious like they have more rap type stuff with the Alphabet Aerobics and Run DMC and they have some rock type stuff with Good Charlotte and The Clash and NoFX and then they have some old stuff like they have Ray Charles with What'd You Say let me play a clip of some of these like songs

675
00:54:28,209 --> 00:54:43,261
[SPEAKER_32]: These are songs that literally made me go WTF when I brought them up in Ultramix 3 And I actually, I got a copy of some of this music so we can play it for you guys here on the show tonight I'm not gonna play the whole one, but I wanna see if you guys have the same reaction I did to this, okay?

676
00:54:43,561 --> 00:54:48,305
[SPEAKER_32]: Imagine you're going through the song list and then suddenly you come across this, okay?

677
00:54:48,725 --> 00:54:51,868
[SPEAKER_32]: Listen to a little clip of this song, and imagine arrows coming up at the screen and all that

678
00:54:53,826 --> 00:54:54,727
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, here's my thing.

679
00:55:18,357 --> 00:55:19,841
[SPEAKER_32]: Is that song a good song?

680
00:55:19,901 --> 00:55:21,043
[SPEAKER_32]: Yes, it's an awesome song.

681
00:55:21,104 --> 00:55:21,945
[SPEAKER_32]: It's a wonderful song.

682
00:55:22,006 --> 00:55:22,888
[SPEAKER_32]: It's an incredible song.

683
00:55:22,928 --> 00:55:23,589
[SPEAKER_32]: I love that song.

684
00:55:23,629 --> 00:55:24,050
[SPEAKER_32]: It's great.

685
00:55:24,491 --> 00:55:25,955
[SPEAKER_32]: Is it a good choice for DDR?

686
00:55:26,610 --> 00:55:28,692
[SPEAKER_32]: Hell no, it's not a good pick for DDR.

687
00:55:28,872 --> 00:55:29,913
[SPEAKER_32]: Hell no.

688
00:55:30,073 --> 00:55:30,273
[SPEAKER_32]: What?

689
00:55:30,554 --> 00:55:31,895
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm like going, eh?

690
00:55:31,915 --> 00:55:32,575
[SPEAKER_32]: I know.

691
00:55:32,816 --> 00:55:33,036
[SPEAKER_32]: I know.

692
00:55:33,196 --> 00:55:39,221
[SPEAKER_32]: And I tried playing it, and the steps were okay, considering they did the best they could with the song.

693
00:55:39,241 --> 00:55:43,645
[SPEAKER_32]: But I like playing DDR because this is one big thing that draws me to DDR.

694
00:55:44,025 --> 00:55:45,387
[SPEAKER_32]: It's like a big jukebox.

695
00:55:45,547 --> 00:55:47,028
[SPEAKER_32]: It's like the jukebox of now.

696
00:55:47,408 --> 00:55:52,773
[SPEAKER_32]: And having to play that song that sounds like it is a copy of a copy of a copy from 19-whatever...

697
00:55:54,334 --> 00:55:55,594
[SPEAKER_32]: I don't know.

698
00:55:55,715 --> 00:55:56,855
[SPEAKER_32]: I can't get into it.

699
00:55:56,975 --> 00:55:58,095
[SPEAKER_32]: I can't get into that song.

700
00:55:58,875 --> 00:56:02,656
[SPEAKER_32]: Here's another classic example.

701
00:56:04,717 --> 00:56:08,038
[SPEAKER_32]: I don't know how to describe it.

702
00:56:08,058 --> 00:56:10,178
[SPEAKER_32]: Here's another pic that was in the game.

703
00:56:10,638 --> 00:56:12,399
[SPEAKER_32]: And you tell me how I'm supposed to dance to this.

704
00:56:32,221 --> 00:56:33,301
Thank you for watching!

705
00:56:51,505 --> 00:56:52,866
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you for watching!

706
00:57:07,015 --> 00:57:09,476
[SPEAKER_32]: Here's my problem with the song list, Konami.

707
00:57:10,116 --> 00:57:12,697
[SPEAKER_32]: If it ain't broke, don't fucking fix it!

708
00:57:13,038 --> 00:57:16,039
[SPEAKER_32]: And Ultramix 2 had the best song list.

709
00:57:16,099 --> 00:57:17,099
[SPEAKER_32]: It was incredible.

710
00:57:17,419 --> 00:57:18,620
[SPEAKER_32]: It was a great song list.

711
00:57:18,780 --> 00:57:24,282
[SPEAKER_32]: All these unknowns coming from a different drum, and great transplants and remixes like Gyruss.

712
00:57:24,682 --> 00:57:24,982
[SPEAKER_32]: Awesome.

713
00:57:25,422 --> 00:57:26,863
[SPEAKER_32]: Why did they break the four?

714
00:57:27,383 --> 00:57:28,944
[SPEAKER_32]: Why did they go and try to change it?

715
00:57:28,984 --> 00:57:39,268
[SPEAKER_32]: Why were they suddenly like, oh, let's be as eclectic as we possibly can be and let's throw in The Clash for no real good reason other than we want to pay homage to The Clash.

716
00:57:39,688 --> 00:57:40,108
[SPEAKER_32]: You know what?

717
00:57:40,168 --> 00:57:45,190
[SPEAKER_32]: Let's put in Ray Charles for no good reason other than we want to pay homage to Ray Charles.

718
00:57:47,591 --> 00:57:48,091
[SPEAKER_32]: I don't get it.

719
00:57:48,251 --> 00:57:49,711
[SPEAKER_32]: Something doesn't add up for me there.

720
00:57:50,212 --> 00:57:53,313
[SPEAKER_32]: Maybe I'm just a stuck up snobby asshole when it comes to my music, but

721
00:57:54,548 --> 00:57:57,570
[SPEAKER_32]: I played those songs once and I will probably not play them again.

722
00:57:57,871 --> 00:58:02,714
[SPEAKER_32]: Which is too bad because, you know, one thing, and going back into things I like about Ultramix 3,

723
00:58:03,757 --> 00:58:24,701
[SPEAKER_32]: The steps are great, and the steps were great in Ultramix 2, and as I understand that they made changes with who's doing the steps at Konami with the other mixes on into Ultramix 2, and it was a change for the better, because they got, you know, folks that were, from what we understand and what we're hearing, folks that were in the know on their DDR making the steps.

724
00:58:25,121 --> 00:58:32,023
[SPEAKER_32]: So, and they've kept that for Ultramix 3, so that's great too, because the steps are all really cool, and they do some new things with them too, which is kind of neat.

725
00:58:33,383 --> 00:58:39,568
[SPEAKER_32]: I was almost surprised, though, that they didn't try to get steps running backward yet, because that's the only thing we haven't seen in DDR yet.

726
00:58:39,628 --> 00:58:43,311
[SPEAKER_32]: And in that Hey Mama song, there's a part where it totally could have ran backwards.

727
00:58:43,351 --> 00:58:43,812
[SPEAKER_32]: It's awesome.

728
00:58:43,892 --> 00:58:44,172
[SPEAKER_32]: I don't know.

729
00:58:44,252 --> 00:58:45,473
[SPEAKER_32]: Anyway, just a weird thought.

730
00:58:45,653 --> 00:58:53,880
[SPEAKER_38]: Actually, the whole backwards thing was an idea we tried to pitch for Ultramix 2 with the Max 300 remix, where it kind of goes... Oh, yeah.

731
00:58:53,940 --> 00:58:56,222
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah, because it sounds like it's being played backwards.

732
00:58:56,482 --> 00:58:59,124
[SPEAKER_38]: We were trying like hell to get the engineering to work, but...

733
00:58:59,989 --> 00:59:01,134
[SPEAKER_38]: It's Hawaii we expect.

734
00:59:01,656 --> 00:59:02,559
[SPEAKER_32]: We'll get on that later.

735
00:59:02,660 --> 00:59:03,162
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah, you know what?

736
00:59:03,262 --> 00:59:04,547
[SPEAKER_32]: I noticed this attitude of...

737
00:59:05,769 --> 00:59:32,205
[SPEAKER_32]: WTF Hawaii and I'm all about showing Hawaii a little love after Ultramix 2 and I said on this show and I do not take it back that if Konami puts out another arcade mix Hawaii should be the one doing it however I would like to go back and amend my previous statement to say whoever did Ultramix 2 should be doing it because Ultramix 3 whoever was calling the shots with the song list I'm sorry I'm not feeling the love here I'm not feeling it and there's other big big problems with Ultramix 3 now

738
00:59:33,860 --> 00:59:38,384
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm not saying Ultramix 3 is a bad game, because it's a great game, and if you own an Xbox, you should be fucking buying this game.

739
00:59:38,424 --> 00:59:38,764
[SPEAKER_32]: You should.

740
00:59:39,224 --> 00:59:40,165
[SPEAKER_32]: There's no question about it.

741
00:59:40,505 --> 00:59:43,588
[SPEAKER_32]: But there are some problems that really make me go WTF.

742
00:59:43,668 --> 00:59:45,690
[SPEAKER_32]: Here is another huge-ass problem.

743
00:59:46,570 --> 00:59:51,734
[SPEAKER_32]: The song packs from Ultramix 2 are horribly off-sync.

744
00:59:52,795 --> 00:59:53,636
[SPEAKER_32]: Don't believe me?

745
00:59:54,957 --> 00:59:55,618
[SPEAKER_32]: Check this out.

746
00:59:56,718 --> 00:59:59,581
[SPEAKER_32]: I have proof that the songs are off-sync.

747
01:00:01,621 --> 01:00:05,543
[SPEAKER_32]: because there might be people out there that say, oh, Ram, you're just playing on your TV.

748
01:00:05,564 --> 01:00:06,584
[SPEAKER_32]: You just think they're off sync.

749
01:00:06,644 --> 01:00:08,665
[SPEAKER_32]: It feels like you're off sync because you're not hitting the buttons at the right time.

750
01:00:08,745 --> 01:00:09,886
[SPEAKER_32]: No, no, no.

751
01:00:10,346 --> 01:00:10,867
[SPEAKER_32]: I have proof.

752
01:00:11,187 --> 01:00:18,171
[SPEAKER_32]: What I did is I took the song into training mode and put it on with claps so you can hear exactly where the arrows fall in the song.

753
01:00:18,412 --> 01:00:18,932
[SPEAKER_32]: Listen to this.

754
01:00:42,793 --> 01:00:49,155
[SPEAKER_32]: Wait, hold on, I want you to listen to that part carefully again, because those notes are supposed to go with that when it comes at that do-do-do-do-do-do-do.

755
01:00:49,495 --> 01:00:54,797
[SPEAKER_32]: Listen, the claps start like almost a full second before it really happens.

756
01:00:54,897 --> 01:00:55,377
[SPEAKER_32]: Listen again.

757
01:01:01,759 --> 01:01:04,099
[SPEAKER_32]: Now, listen to this next part coming up with the freezes.

758
01:01:04,599 --> 01:01:06,020
[SPEAKER_32]: All the notes are on the upbeats.

759
01:01:06,060 --> 01:01:06,440
[SPEAKER_32]: Watch this.

760
01:01:16,058 --> 01:01:18,099
[SPEAKER_32]: Those steps are supposed to be on the sirens.

761
01:01:18,439 --> 01:01:19,139
[SPEAKER_32]: You get my picture?

762
01:01:19,419 --> 01:01:26,141
[SPEAKER_38]: Wow, I totally feel like I'm flashback to two years ago QAing Ultramix 1, where it was horribly long.

763
01:01:26,181 --> 01:01:30,362
[SPEAKER_32]: Well, apparently somebody forgot to QA the second song packs or something.

764
01:01:30,482 --> 01:01:30,842
[SPEAKER_32]: I don't know.

765
01:01:31,163 --> 01:01:35,784
[SPEAKER_32]: But now the community who paid five bucks for those songs, hoping that they get to play them on Ultramix 3, they're pissed!

766
01:01:36,581 --> 01:01:53,816
[SPEAKER_32]: They're pissed because they can't play those songs in Ultramix 3, they're ruined We were doing, we played, I was playing on live the other day with people, I don't know these people, they're just random people on live That song came up, we did like a random pick, I don't know, and that song came up and we played that on live And everybody was like, what the fuck, this song is fucked, what happened to this?

767
01:01:54,376 --> 01:02:03,324
[SPEAKER_38]: Babe, now you know why we have such a huge freaking timing window in Ultramix That was Disabled the Flaw, by the way, from Songpack 9, if you don't believe me

768
01:02:06,189 --> 01:02:33,406
[SPEAKER_32]: so there it is, audio proof that the damn thing is off sync and they should put out a patch, now the community is saying you gotta patch it, you gotta patch it, put out a patch I'm wondering if they can put out a patch, the game's probably not built to take a patch, I don't know because like Halo's different, when you go to Halo, Halo connects to the internet right away and if it sees the patch it gets it if DDR was not set up to do that, you're not going to be able to get a patch that easy so I don't know, I don't know what they're going to do, I doubt they're going to do anything

769
01:02:34,482 --> 01:02:35,383
[SPEAKER_31]: You can patch a game like that.

770
01:02:35,423 --> 01:02:39,045
[SPEAKER_31]: Just like they patched WWE WrestleMania 21.

771
01:02:39,105 --> 01:02:41,807
[SPEAKER_31]: They can do a patch on that.

772
01:02:43,688 --> 01:02:43,948
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright.

773
01:02:45,269 --> 01:02:45,629
[SPEAKER_32]: Here we go.

774
01:02:45,709 --> 01:02:46,770
[SPEAKER_32]: I want to play this as well.

775
01:02:46,790 --> 01:02:48,251
[SPEAKER_32]: This is the other thing that pisses me off.

776
01:02:48,291 --> 01:02:51,173
[SPEAKER_32]: And once again, I have audio proof that this pisses me off.

777
01:02:51,213 --> 01:02:52,394
[SPEAKER_32]: And you cannot dispute this.

778
01:02:53,795 --> 01:02:54,275
[SPEAKER_32]: You cannot.

779
01:02:56,156 --> 01:02:56,877
[SPEAKER_32]: Here's my beef.

780
01:02:58,271 --> 01:03:01,112
[SPEAKER_32]: Loading times in Ultramix series have been kind of iffy as it is.

781
01:03:02,412 --> 01:03:04,713
[SPEAKER_32]: Now I would like to show you what it's like to load the game.

782
01:03:04,773 --> 01:03:09,314
[SPEAKER_32]: Now I'm not even counting in the beginning, the game loads up, you get to the title screen.

783
01:03:09,954 --> 01:03:13,555
[SPEAKER_32]: What happens is that then there's a moment where it goes, loading songpacks.

784
01:03:14,015 --> 01:03:18,576
[SPEAKER_32]: And you have to wait, and you see these little bubble animations on the screen while it's loading your songpacks, which is okay.

785
01:03:19,614 --> 01:03:25,618
[SPEAKER_32]: makes sense, that's how, even though the songpacks are off sync and not worth loading anyway, this is how it, you know, brings them into the game.

786
01:03:25,879 --> 01:03:33,884
[SPEAKER_32]: However, I would like to play for you guys, this is a direct audio rip, I am not fudging anything here, this is a direct audio rip from earlier today, when I was booting up the game and playing.

787
01:03:34,205 --> 01:03:39,568
[SPEAKER_32]: So you're gonna hear the title music for just a minute, and then you're gonna hear a bloop bloop, that is the game starting to load, after I hit the A button.

788
01:03:39,789 --> 01:03:43,231
[SPEAKER_32]: And I'm not gonna shorten this or anything, this is seriously how long the load time is.

789
01:03:45,813 --> 01:03:48,475
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay, so here's a little tile screen, okay, and then here we go.

790
01:04:01,850 --> 01:04:04,252
[SPEAKER_37]: Goddammit, Rob, stop farting in the bathtub!

791
01:04:04,272 --> 01:04:18,204
[SPEAKER_32]: It's been about... let's see... 30 seconds.

792
01:04:23,949 --> 01:04:25,310
[SPEAKER_38]: I think I'll go get up and make a sandwich.

793
01:04:25,971 --> 01:04:28,653
[SPEAKER_38]: Little bit longer than William Hung's stardom.

794
01:04:40,952 --> 01:04:42,013
[SPEAKER_21]: That is a tasty burger.

795
01:04:43,194 --> 01:04:46,716
[SPEAKER_21]: I wonder if my game's gonna load any day now.

796
01:04:48,718 --> 01:04:51,640
[SPEAKER_32]: Wow, I'd really like to play some DDR today.

797
01:04:52,861 --> 01:04:53,061
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh!

798
01:04:53,121 --> 01:04:53,681
[SPEAKER_21]: There we go!

799
01:04:53,941 --> 01:04:54,482
[SPEAKER_21]: Finally!

800
01:04:54,782 --> 01:04:56,003
[SPEAKER_32]: The goddamn thing loaded!

801
01:04:56,083 --> 01:04:56,583
[SPEAKER_32]: Finally!

802
01:04:57,604 --> 01:04:59,185
[SPEAKER_32]: One minute, five seconds.

803
01:05:00,126 --> 01:05:04,729
[SPEAKER_32]: One whole minute for the goddamn songpacks to load and they don't even work!

804
01:05:07,845 --> 01:05:16,811
[SPEAKER_32]: Needless to say, if that's going to be the case, importing the songpacks probably should have been an option that you could choose to do before you go into the game.

805
01:05:17,332 --> 01:05:17,692
[SPEAKER_32]: I don't know.

806
01:05:18,012 --> 01:05:20,054
[SPEAKER_32]: Or maybe just optimize your thing a little better.

807
01:05:20,154 --> 01:05:20,474
[SPEAKER_32]: I don't know.

808
01:05:20,694 --> 01:05:22,375
[SPEAKER_27]: You know, they say that DDR is exercise.

809
01:05:22,395 --> 01:05:26,498
[SPEAKER_27]: This exercise would be screaming at the freaking console for it to load faster.

810
01:05:28,199 --> 01:05:29,480
[SPEAKER_19]: That is just crazy.

811
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:31,422
[SPEAKER_19]: Exercise and patience.

812
01:05:31,642 --> 01:05:31,842
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

813
01:05:35,100 --> 01:05:36,381
[SPEAKER_19]: Welcome to DDR!

814
01:05:36,461 --> 01:05:38,261
[SPEAKER_19]: Now we're gonna exercise your patience!

815
01:05:39,842 --> 01:05:40,442
[SPEAKER_21]: Jesus.

816
01:05:45,625 --> 01:05:45,905
[SPEAKER_32]: Anyway.

817
01:05:46,225 --> 01:05:47,386
[SPEAKER_32]: I don't know what else to say about that.

818
01:05:47,446 --> 01:05:47,926
[SPEAKER_32]: Come on!

819
01:05:49,006 --> 01:05:49,287
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright.

820
01:05:49,607 --> 01:05:51,267
[SPEAKER_32]: So I'm dogging on the game a little bit.

821
01:05:51,908 --> 01:05:54,329
[SPEAKER_32]: All in all, though, it's not bad.

822
01:05:54,489 --> 01:05:57,270
[SPEAKER_32]: I just liked Ultramix 2 a little bit better.

823
01:05:57,850 --> 01:05:58,751
[SPEAKER_32]: Mel, what are your thoughts?

824
01:05:59,909 --> 01:06:02,970
[SPEAKER_38]: Well, I guess I liked it better because I was on Ultramix 2.

825
01:06:03,390 --> 01:06:03,810
[SPEAKER_38]: Who knows?

826
01:06:04,130 --> 01:06:05,431
[SPEAKER_38]: It's a curse, perhaps.

827
01:06:06,051 --> 01:06:18,195
[SPEAKER_38]: No, but just from, I guess, talking to people who are on the project and such, I think either Hawaii or RMC, spending a little too much time on things that were...

828
01:06:19,119 --> 01:06:24,683
[SPEAKER_38]: Not all that crucial, like, I heard quest mode got way too much more attention than it really needed to be.

829
01:06:25,524 --> 01:06:27,486
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh, god, I didn't even mention quest mode.

830
01:06:27,506 --> 01:06:34,912
[SPEAKER_32]: I mean, quest mode is... I mean, I guess it's cute, but the thing, the setup in EX2 was way better.

831
01:06:34,952 --> 01:06:37,774
[SPEAKER_32]: Whatever that thing was, I don't even remember what it was, mission mode or whatever, it was way better.

832
01:06:38,414 --> 01:06:39,996
[SPEAKER_32]: That's what I expected quest mode was gonna be.

833
01:06:40,496 --> 01:06:43,939
[SPEAKER_32]: I didn't realize quest mode was just, play a lot of DDR and get shit.

834
01:06:44,199 --> 01:06:45,460
[SPEAKER_32]: That's basically what quest mode is.

835
01:06:45,720 --> 01:07:04,318
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah, and, like, there's so many bugs you can do to, like, gain more, you know, points or, you know, money or whatever, like, you can actually load your own edits into it, and, like, what they did was, they would do, like, all 16ths in, like, a circle pattern, so you just sit there and you rub the controller, boom, you know, so you jack up the, you know, points hardcore, um...

836
01:07:05,521 --> 01:07:10,709
[SPEAKER_38]: Other than that, I mean, like, song list, I think it's sort of like, it's kind of like the iPod shuffle theory.

837
01:07:10,749 --> 01:07:15,756
[SPEAKER_38]: They think, wow, if we can get it as broad as possible, we're going to look that much cooler, you know, but...

838
01:07:16,697 --> 01:07:19,740
[SPEAKER_32]: At the risk of alienating your fanbase that supported you through Ultramix 2.

839
01:07:20,180 --> 01:07:38,936
[SPEAKER_32]: Basically, I mean, you know, I know they want to be different, it's a good thing, you know, I mean, Ultramix, you know, has its own identity for the most part, but... Let's face it, we had to forgive Hawaii an awful lot for Ultramix 1, and then, you know, for Ultramix 2, it was like, okay, guys, okay, you proved yourselves with Ultramix 2, we're cool, we can be a happy family, just don't disappoint us again.

840
01:07:39,236 --> 01:07:42,119
[SPEAKER_32]: And then, pfft, song list was woo!

841
01:07:42,299 --> 01:07:44,581
[SPEAKER_27]: Is it gonna be like Madden, where every other year it's good?

842
01:07:45,106 --> 01:07:46,167
[SPEAKER_27]: and every other year it sucks.

843
01:07:46,207 --> 01:07:47,308
[SPEAKER_32]: It's like the Star Treks.

844
01:07:47,389 --> 01:07:48,730
[SPEAKER_32]: The even number ones are good.

845
01:07:51,373 --> 01:07:51,773
[SPEAKER_32]: We'll see.

846
01:07:52,734 --> 01:07:53,815
[SPEAKER_21]: Con!

847
01:07:54,556 --> 01:07:54,997
[SPEAKER_21]: Shut up.

848
01:07:55,417 --> 01:07:55,838
[SPEAKER_21]: All of you.

849
01:07:57,640 --> 01:07:58,941
[SPEAKER_32]: Stop ruining this station.

850
01:07:59,061 --> 01:07:59,361
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright.

851
01:07:59,862 --> 01:08:00,523
[SPEAKER_32]: Anything else, Mel?

852
01:08:01,143 --> 01:08:02,365
[SPEAKER_38]: I don't know.

853
01:08:02,405 --> 01:08:02,665
[SPEAKER_38]: I think

854
01:08:03,206 --> 01:08:06,249
[SPEAKER_38]: You know, like, did they just put a little too much into the game?

855
01:08:06,269 --> 01:08:09,151
[SPEAKER_38]: You know, just like, there's that whole dance, you know, freestyle mode and all that?

856
01:08:09,492 --> 01:08:15,577
[SPEAKER_38]: I think they could have done without, you know, most of it's like, spend more time on, you know, the actual gameplay stuff on the timing windows and all that.

857
01:08:15,617 --> 01:08:19,281
[SPEAKER_38]: I mean, granted, it's not as big as, like, Alaska now, you know.

858
01:08:19,561 --> 01:08:21,683
[SPEAKER_38]: It's not as big as Nevada, you know.

859
01:08:22,123 --> 01:08:27,068
[SPEAKER_32]: But, um... Well, I think maybe it's the kind of thing where they're like, well, they're not gonna notice it.

860
01:08:27,985 --> 01:08:28,705
[SPEAKER_32]: Whoops!

861
01:08:29,086 --> 01:08:31,727
[SPEAKER_32]: You forgot how rabid these DDR freaks can be.

862
01:08:31,827 --> 01:08:32,647
[SPEAKER_32]: Yes, we're going to notice.

863
01:08:32,907 --> 01:08:34,808
[SPEAKER_38]: Engineers don't notice it.

864
01:08:34,968 --> 01:08:36,509
[SPEAKER_38]: The QA people do.

865
01:08:36,949 --> 01:08:40,111
[SPEAKER_38]: The stuff they have on there, they know there's stuff.

866
01:08:40,151 --> 01:08:43,952
[SPEAKER_32]: I have a feeling that they knew some of this stuff was going on.

867
01:08:45,353 --> 01:08:46,193
[SPEAKER_32]: I don't know.

868
01:08:46,253 --> 01:08:48,234
[SPEAKER_32]: I can't speculate too much.

869
01:08:49,155 --> 01:08:51,816
[SPEAKER_38]: I don't know if it's just reticence or laziness or what.

870
01:08:51,916 --> 01:08:55,698
[SPEAKER_38]: I ain't going to say one way or another because I haven't nearly been close to the situation.

871
01:08:56,358 --> 01:08:56,618
[SPEAKER_38]: But

872
01:08:57,383 --> 01:09:02,107
[SPEAKER_38]: You know, overall, hey, you know, they figure DDR, it's Xbox, it has to sell.

873
01:09:03,048 --> 01:09:03,328
[SPEAKER_32]: I know.

874
01:09:03,768 --> 01:09:14,397
[SPEAKER_32]: I just hope when they do Ultramix 4 or Xbox 360 DDR, whatever's next for them, assuming there's going to be another mix, which there has to be, I can't see DDR dying just because the song list pissed me off.

875
01:09:15,038 --> 01:09:16,779
[SPEAKER_32]: I want there to be another mix.

876
01:09:17,039 --> 01:09:18,981
[SPEAKER_32]: The mix overall isn't bad.

877
01:09:19,101 --> 01:09:19,441
[SPEAKER_32]: It's not.

878
01:09:19,481 --> 01:09:20,442
[SPEAKER_32]: It's a good game, again.

879
01:09:20,462 --> 01:09:20,962
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm just saying that.

880
01:09:20,982 --> 01:09:22,844
[SPEAKER_32]: It's just these little things make me mad.

881
01:09:23,865 --> 01:09:26,427
[SPEAKER_32]: But when they do the future mix, I just, you know,

882
01:09:29,360 --> 01:09:31,642
[SPEAKER_32]: I hope they stick with the things that worked for them in Ultimix 2.

883
01:09:34,084 --> 01:09:34,684
[SPEAKER_32]: What else can I say?

884
01:09:34,724 --> 01:09:35,024
[SPEAKER_32]: I don't know.

885
01:09:35,604 --> 01:09:37,606
[SPEAKER_32]: I would like to see them shake up the interface a little more, too.

886
01:09:37,646 --> 01:09:43,229
[SPEAKER_32]: Ultimix 3 felt like Ultimix 2 Plus in a lot of ways, because they didn't really change the interface except the bubbles.

887
01:09:43,850 --> 01:09:51,275
[SPEAKER_32]: And I'm okay with the bubbles thing, but where the bubbles thing got awful was the little reflections of the bubbles blocked the graphics.

888
01:09:51,515 --> 01:09:56,138
[SPEAKER_32]: It's like, okay, somebody in the art department wasn't thinking that whole thing out or something.

889
01:09:56,158 --> 01:09:56,478
[SPEAKER_32]: I don't know.

890
01:09:57,042 --> 01:09:57,702
[SPEAKER_32]: So, whatever.

891
01:09:59,243 --> 01:09:59,744
[SPEAKER_32]: Anyway.

892
01:10:01,885 --> 01:10:03,326
[SPEAKER_32]: Any other comments from anybody on Ultramix 3?

893
01:10:04,367 --> 01:10:05,688
[SPEAKER_32]: You guys asleep over here?

894
01:10:05,948 --> 01:10:07,108
[SPEAKER_32]: Mario Kart over here, Loki?

895
01:10:07,129 --> 01:10:10,691
[SPEAKER_31]: Hey, I haven't played Ultramix 3, so I can't comment.

896
01:10:10,891 --> 01:10:15,274
[SPEAKER_31]: Other than that some of the music is really weird.

897
01:10:16,324 --> 01:10:23,890
[SPEAKER_25]: I almost want to, you know, say, oh, what the hell, I'll, you know, go ahead and get it because I have 1 and 2 sitting at home also.

898
01:10:23,930 --> 01:10:27,573
[SPEAKER_31]: Is the online mode any better than Extreme 2's online mode?

899
01:10:27,593 --> 01:10:28,774
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh, the online mode is incredible.

900
01:10:28,814 --> 01:10:29,834
[SPEAKER_32]: The online mode is great.

901
01:10:29,874 --> 01:10:31,015
[SPEAKER_32]: It's the best online VR yet.

902
01:10:31,035 --> 01:10:34,678
[SPEAKER_31]: Does it still have tournament mode in there where you can run a tournament on it?

903
01:10:34,878 --> 01:10:36,880
[SPEAKER_31]: I think so, but I'm going to be honest, I didn't really look.

904
01:10:39,061 --> 01:10:39,582
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay.

905
01:10:40,923 --> 01:10:41,143
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

906
01:10:42,214 --> 01:10:43,636
[SPEAKER_32]: We're going to go to another break, you guys.

907
01:10:43,676 --> 01:10:49,461
[SPEAKER_32]: When we come back from this break, you guys will have a chance to give your thoughts on Ultramix 3 and anything else that's on your mind.

908
01:10:49,501 --> 01:10:53,104
[SPEAKER_32]: I know we have some folks that want to talk about this MTV taping some of them went to on the East Coast.

909
01:10:53,404 --> 01:10:54,585
[SPEAKER_32]: They want to call in and talk about this.

910
01:10:54,986 --> 01:10:56,647
[SPEAKER_32]: Some other random stories you guys want to talk about.

911
01:10:56,767 --> 01:10:59,830
[SPEAKER_32]: It's your show when we come back from this break and we open up the sky blind.

912
01:10:59,870 --> 01:11:01,432
[SPEAKER_31]: Was it Orange Lounge goes to...

913
01:11:02,092 --> 01:11:03,293
[SPEAKER_32]: Orange Lounge Goes to the Movies

914
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:34,241
Thank you for watching!

915
01:12:59,393 --> 01:13:00,395
Thanks for watching!

916
01:13:29,677 --> 01:13:31,599
Lyrics, Lyrics, Lyrics

917
01:14:58,743 --> 01:14:59,664
Thank you for watching!

918
01:17:09,398 --> 01:17:23,803
[SPEAKER_21]: All the life, all the life, all the life we're living I just wanna live Don't really care about the things that we say Don't really care about what others are saying I just wanna live

919
01:17:35,535 --> 01:17:36,655
Thanks for watching!

920
01:18:19,309 --> 01:18:23,192
[SPEAKER_32]: Orange Lounge Radio, Bomani Music, and more.

921
01:18:23,313 --> 01:18:23,633
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect!

922
01:18:26,786 --> 01:18:43,416
[SPEAKER_32]: Hi kids, we're back here on Orange Lounge Radio, and in that break you heard some more music from the DDR Ultramix 3, including Conflict by the Azoic, Why by Neveraka, Rock Lobster by the B-52s, and I Just Wanna Live by Good Charlotte's on that mix.

923
01:18:43,476 --> 01:18:47,118
[SPEAKER_32]: So, you know, I was a little iffy with Good Charlotte being an Ultramix, but...

924
01:18:48,934 --> 01:18:49,515
[SPEAKER_32]: DDR Ultramix 3

925
01:19:17,964 --> 01:19:22,686
[SPEAKER_29]: Oh, as you know, I've always been a huge supporter of the Ultramix series.

926
01:19:22,726 --> 01:19:24,327
[SPEAKER_32]: Your volume just went down by half.

927
01:19:24,367 --> 01:19:25,788
[SPEAKER_32]: I don't know if you moved your microphone.

928
01:19:25,828 --> 01:19:26,248
[SPEAKER_32]: There we go.

929
01:19:27,489 --> 01:19:27,889
[SPEAKER_32]: Try it again.

930
01:19:29,530 --> 01:19:30,590
[SPEAKER_32]: Now we can't hear you at all.

931
01:19:31,911 --> 01:19:33,551
[SPEAKER_32]: I think... Is that better?

932
01:19:33,571 --> 01:19:33,972
[SPEAKER_32]: There we go.

933
01:19:33,992 --> 01:19:34,572
[SPEAKER_32]: Yes, much better.

934
01:19:34,672 --> 01:19:34,972
[SPEAKER_32]: What's up?

935
01:19:36,213 --> 01:19:43,016
[SPEAKER_29]: Okay, I've always been a huge supporter, but this mix kind of dropped the bomb in a lot of areas.

936
01:19:44,031 --> 01:19:45,311
[SPEAKER_29]: Come on and drop the bomb!

937
01:19:48,392 --> 01:19:49,132
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright, I'm kidding.

938
01:19:49,992 --> 01:19:51,012
[SPEAKER_32]: You know I couldn't resist.

939
01:19:51,753 --> 01:19:52,833
[SPEAKER_32]: Why did it drop the bomb?

940
01:19:53,793 --> 01:19:57,794
[SPEAKER_29]: Well, for one, they added a bunch of rock songs that we didn't need to hear.

941
01:19:59,174 --> 01:19:59,734
[SPEAKER_32]: I'll give you that.

942
01:20:00,254 --> 01:20:06,556
[SPEAKER_32]: I understand, like, NoFX and The Clash wanting to pay homage to them, but I don't think they really worked for DDR.

943
01:20:07,076 --> 01:20:08,616
[SPEAKER_32]: I didn't get that, but...

944
01:20:09,571 --> 01:20:14,195
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah, but mostly I think the song pack thing is completely unforgivable.

945
01:20:14,535 --> 01:20:15,697
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't get that at all.

946
01:20:15,917 --> 01:20:18,099
[SPEAKER_32]: Did you hear the little audio clip I played earlier?

947
01:20:18,652 --> 01:20:25,194
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah, and I've been playing, I've been trying to play songs, and a lot of them are songs I've loved, like Diamond Jealousy and R5.

948
01:20:25,815 --> 01:20:27,915
[SPEAKER_32]: And yeah, it's not just limited to like three songs.

949
01:20:27,976 --> 01:20:37,699
[SPEAKER_32]: I know Rini compiled some stuff and put it on the DDR Freak forum, and probably half the other forums out there on the internet, and it's got like Jack and Mark Get Busy and all these other songs.

950
01:20:37,719 --> 01:20:40,740
[SPEAKER_32]: I mean, it's like a list of like ten songs that are broken in the song packs.

951
01:20:40,900 --> 01:20:41,981
[SPEAKER_32]: It's sucky.

952
01:20:42,561 --> 01:20:43,321
[SPEAKER_32]: It's ridiculous.

953
01:20:43,741 --> 01:20:45,662
[SPEAKER_29]: It's completely unprofessional in my opinion.

954
01:20:45,882 --> 01:20:46,803
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah, it sucks.

955
01:20:47,183 --> 01:20:47,543
[SPEAKER_32]: It sucks.

956
01:20:49,300 --> 01:20:50,180
[SPEAKER_32]: How did they miss that?

957
01:20:50,240 --> 01:20:50,901
[SPEAKER_32]: That's what I want to know.

958
01:20:50,941 --> 01:20:53,603
[SPEAKER_32]: It's like somebody didn't even test to see if the songpacks worked.

959
01:20:53,943 --> 01:20:54,303
[SPEAKER_32]: I don't know.

960
01:20:54,363 --> 01:20:55,104
[SPEAKER_32]: How do you miss that?

961
01:20:55,765 --> 01:20:56,285
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't know.

962
01:20:57,466 --> 01:20:58,967
[SPEAKER_32]: Or they knew about it and just didn't give a shit.

963
01:20:59,067 --> 01:20:59,387
[SPEAKER_32]: I don't know.

964
01:21:00,568 --> 01:21:01,369
[SPEAKER_29]: Something like that.

965
01:21:01,429 --> 01:21:01,869
[SPEAKER_29]: Who knows?

966
01:21:02,269 --> 01:21:02,650
[SPEAKER_32]: What else?

967
01:21:02,730 --> 01:21:04,211
[SPEAKER_32]: Any other thoughts you have on Ultimix 3?

968
01:21:05,592 --> 01:21:11,536
[SPEAKER_29]: A lot of things I like is a bunch of songs like So Many Times, which I absolutely love.

969
01:21:12,437 --> 01:21:15,219
[SPEAKER_32]: I think we have that queued for the next break, so we'll play that, definitely.

970
01:21:16,024 --> 01:21:19,246
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah, the steps are really good this time.

971
01:21:19,886 --> 01:21:26,069
[SPEAKER_32]: The steps are all pretty good, especially when you consider that there are some songs where it's like, you know, this shouldn't even be in DDR.

972
01:21:26,770 --> 01:21:29,111
[SPEAKER_32]: The steps, they do the best they can, you know what I mean?

973
01:21:29,711 --> 01:21:37,956
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah, like even the songs that aren't made for DDR, like Meowma and all that, they're just fun to play, so...

974
01:21:38,813 --> 01:21:45,194
[SPEAKER_32]: I, I, I just, whereas the steps are good, I'm not going to knock the steps because they do the best they can.

975
01:21:45,294 --> 01:21:48,755
[SPEAKER_32]: It's not fun to play because the song makes my ears want to, you know, scream out in pain.

976
01:21:49,115 --> 01:21:50,255
[SPEAKER_32]: I can't, I can't play it.

977
01:21:50,675 --> 01:21:50,895
[SPEAKER_32]: So.

978
01:21:50,915 --> 01:22:00,517
[SPEAKER_29]: Um, besides that, um, I'm kind of iffy about the online because it's a lot better this time.

979
01:22:01,197 --> 01:22:05,138
[SPEAKER_32]: I think the online is like the best part too, is like they really improved online support.

980
01:22:06,075 --> 01:22:13,440
[SPEAKER_29]: But the scoring is still a little iffy, because if you get a full combo, you instantly win, which is really annoying.

981
01:22:15,462 --> 01:22:23,307
[SPEAKER_29]: Because, you know, I've been through, like, multiple players already where they've gotten 50 greats and I've gotten 7, and I lose, and I'm like, what the fuck?!

982
01:22:24,028 --> 01:22:25,348
[SPEAKER_29]: Why, because you didn't get a full combo?

983
01:22:26,069 --> 01:22:30,132
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah, I, like, got a miss because the controller for Xbox is completely CBR.

984
01:22:32,239 --> 01:22:41,627
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah, I don't know if it's keeping track of my win-loss record appropriately, but I do like the fact that it shows on the little preview what your highest score is.

985
01:22:41,787 --> 01:22:44,670
[SPEAKER_32]: Because in my case, I have a triple-A, so my highest score is a perfect score.

986
01:22:44,910 --> 01:22:47,853
[SPEAKER_32]: And it shows how many triple-As and how many double-As you have, which I think is kind of cool.

987
01:22:47,893 --> 01:22:48,974
[SPEAKER_32]: That's kind of neat.

988
01:22:49,014 --> 01:22:49,614
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah, I like that.

989
01:22:49,654 --> 01:22:50,095
[SPEAKER_32]: That's funny.

990
01:22:51,556 --> 01:22:52,016
[SPEAKER_29]: Okay.

991
01:22:52,136 --> 01:22:52,677
[SPEAKER_29]: Besides that.

992
01:22:53,057 --> 01:22:55,700
[SPEAKER_32]: Well, anything else you want to share about the mix, Jess, before I get to another call?

993
01:22:57,081 --> 01:22:57,381
[SPEAKER_32]: Instead.

994
01:22:57,708 --> 01:23:01,429
[SPEAKER_29]: Perfectly good to me, besides all the crap that's messed up.

995
01:23:01,910 --> 01:23:03,070
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah, alright.

996
01:23:03,130 --> 01:23:04,290
[SPEAKER_32]: On a scale of 1 to 10?

997
01:23:07,091 --> 01:23:04,290
7.

998
01:23:07,512 --> 01:23:07,872
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright.

999
01:23:08,532 --> 01:23:09,172
[SPEAKER_32]: Take care, Jazz.

1000
01:23:09,192 --> 01:23:09,832
[SPEAKER_32]: Thanks for calling in.

1001
01:23:09,892 --> 01:23:10,833
[SPEAKER_32]: Have a good one, okay?

1002
01:23:11,513 --> 01:23:12,233
[SPEAKER_32]: Have a nice day.

1003
01:23:12,353 --> 01:23:12,754
[SPEAKER_32]: Later.

1004
01:23:13,434 --> 01:23:13,714
[SPEAKER_32]: Bye.

1005
01:23:14,134 --> 01:23:15,915
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright, let's go to another call.

1006
01:23:16,055 --> 01:23:17,855
[SPEAKER_32]: We are getting hammered tonight, boys and girls.

1007
01:23:17,895 --> 01:23:18,956
[SPEAKER_32]: We may not get to all the calls.

1008
01:23:19,076 --> 01:23:20,917
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm really sorry, but we're going to try our best, okay?

1009
01:23:21,477 --> 01:23:22,837
[SPEAKER_32]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1010
01:23:23,958 --> 01:23:25,278
[SPEAKER_41]: Hi, Sephiroth 1215 here.

1011
01:23:25,418 --> 01:23:26,339
[SPEAKER_32]: Hi, Sephiroth 1215.

1012
01:23:26,699 --> 01:23:27,379
[SPEAKER_32]: What's on your mind, buddy?

1013
01:23:29,364 --> 01:23:30,065
[SPEAKER_41]: Just two things.

1014
01:23:30,105 --> 01:23:36,407
[SPEAKER_41]: First of all, about Ultra Mix 3 really quickly, it's pretty good.

1015
01:23:36,467 --> 01:23:42,130
[SPEAKER_41]: I mean, first of all, I say I do like The Clash a lot, so I appreciate that song a lot more.

1016
01:23:42,590 --> 01:23:44,091
[SPEAKER_32]: But is it a good DDR song?

1017
01:23:46,292 --> 01:23:47,232
[SPEAKER_41]: It seems kind of fit.

1018
01:23:47,252 --> 01:23:48,032
[SPEAKER_41]: It's really catchy.

1019
01:23:48,192 --> 01:23:48,613
[SPEAKER_41]: Alright.

1020
01:23:48,873 --> 01:23:51,694
[SPEAKER_41]: I guess that's just where people have difference of opinion, but okay.

1021
01:23:53,504 --> 01:24:21,637
[SPEAKER_32]: But otherwise, alright, they do have a lot of problems But the whole loading time thing, it's the same thing in the other Ultramix games It's just they don't have the loading screen Maybe that's what it is, it doesn't feel like it's so long in the other games Or maybe it's because there's not as many songpacks they're trying to import or something, I don't know Like I knew in Ultramix 2 it was kind of a little bit slow But, I don't know, you just didn't feel it, it wasn't a minute long It seems like it's really bad in this one, I don't know, maybe it's just me

1022
01:24:23,601 --> 01:24:28,406
[SPEAKER_41]: Yeah, and quote from PoPanda21 is, she loves the bubbles.

1023
01:24:30,188 --> 01:24:34,692
[SPEAKER_32]: The bubbles, I'm okay with the bubbles theme, but I just think it could have been better.

1024
01:24:34,893 --> 01:24:37,095
[SPEAKER_32]: Like, it could have been executed better, the bubbles.

1025
01:24:37,355 --> 01:24:39,638
[SPEAKER_32]: But anyway, this isn't about me, this is about your thoughts.

1026
01:24:39,898 --> 01:24:40,398
[SPEAKER_32]: I'll shut up.

1027
01:24:41,880 --> 01:24:42,280
[SPEAKER_41]: Alright, um...

1028
01:24:43,646 --> 01:24:48,250
[SPEAKER_41]: But otherwise, I went to the MTV taping on Tuesday.

1029
01:24:49,432 --> 01:24:50,152
[SPEAKER_41]: Now what was this for?

1030
01:24:50,172 --> 01:24:51,233
[SPEAKER_41]: The MTV taping for what?

1031
01:24:51,293 --> 01:24:52,795
[SPEAKER_32]: Gamesores or whatever it is they're doing?

1032
01:24:53,636 --> 01:24:56,679
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah, it's Gameores Week, which is pretty lame.

1033
01:24:56,899 --> 01:24:57,580
[SPEAKER_32]: Gameores.

1034
01:24:59,181 --> 01:25:00,562
[SPEAKER_32]: God bless MTV.

1035
01:25:01,163 --> 01:25:02,284
[SPEAKER_32]: God bless them.

1036
01:25:03,145 --> 01:25:03,826
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright, how was it?

1037
01:25:03,866 --> 01:25:04,426
[SPEAKER_32]: What'd they do?

1038
01:25:04,486 --> 01:25:06,708
[SPEAKER_32]: What can you expect on Gameores Week?

1039
01:25:10,385 --> 01:25:11,966
[SPEAKER_41]: Honestly, really not much.

1040
01:25:12,786 --> 01:25:15,308
[SPEAKER_41]: I mean, I was kind of psyched up at first.

1041
01:25:15,528 --> 01:25:24,993
[SPEAKER_41]: I was waiting on line to get in, and I was in front of the line, so she's like, oh, you know, you first six or seven people, you come into the gaming room.

1042
01:25:25,033 --> 01:25:27,554
[SPEAKER_41]: So I'm like, all right, gaming room is going to be awesome.

1043
01:25:28,174 --> 01:25:29,955
[SPEAKER_41]: But then we get there.

1044
01:25:30,475 --> 01:25:31,096
[SPEAKER_41]: It looks cool.

1045
01:25:31,136 --> 01:25:32,456
[SPEAKER_41]: They have nice TVs and everything.

1046
01:25:32,496 --> 01:25:33,037
[SPEAKER_41]: They have a 360 set up.

1047
01:25:33,097 --> 01:25:33,657
[SPEAKER_41]: Like one 360?

1048
01:25:34,758 --> 01:25:34,918
[SPEAKER_41]: Yeah.

1049
01:25:37,779 --> 01:25:39,801
[SPEAKER_32]: I bet she doesn't even know what a 360 is.

1050
01:25:39,821 --> 01:25:41,583
[SPEAKER_32]: It just matches her purse, that cunt.

1051
01:25:41,603 --> 01:25:42,083
[SPEAKER_32]: Anyway, sorry.

1052
01:25:42,103 --> 01:25:44,265
[SPEAKER_31]: It was a 360 with only one controller.

1053
01:25:57,950 --> 01:26:00,392
[SPEAKER_32]: Well, again, didn't you hear about the shortage problems?

1054
01:26:01,252 --> 01:26:02,993
[SPEAKER_32]: Now we're going to play a 32-player deathmatch.

1055
01:26:03,194 --> 01:26:04,835
[SPEAKER_32]: Go!

1056
01:26:05,915 --> 01:26:08,537
[SPEAKER_32]: It's like Mario Party 7, where it splits up the controller.

1057
01:26:09,438 --> 01:26:19,104
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay, now, Sephiroth 1215, you get a button, and this guy over here, you get a button, and you get a button, and suddenly it's like the Oprah show, and you get a button, and you get a button, and you get a button!

1058
01:26:20,565 --> 01:26:21,626
[SPEAKER_41]: Sorry, that was really random.

1059
01:26:21,646 --> 01:26:21,946
[SPEAKER_41]: I'm sorry.

1060
01:26:21,966 --> 01:26:22,266
[SPEAKER_41]: Go ahead.

1061
01:26:23,887 --> 01:26:27,149
[SPEAKER_41]: It doesn't even matter, because the batteries die in the controller anyway.

1062
01:26:31,468 --> 01:26:32,269
[SPEAKER_41]: Good game.

1063
01:26:32,389 --> 01:26:33,330
[SPEAKER_41]: GG, MTV.

1064
01:26:33,730 --> 01:26:34,190
[SPEAKER_41]: GG.

1065
01:26:35,351 --> 01:26:44,216
[SPEAKER_41]: And they didn't do much, so they just gave a fake controller and just said, pretend to play to the person who was there.

1066
01:26:46,397 --> 01:26:46,737
[SPEAKER_41]: Wow.

1067
01:26:47,938 --> 01:26:50,280
[SPEAKER_41]: I was the one sitting there playing a stupid Frogger game.

1068
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:52,801
[SPEAKER_41]: You got to play the new Frogger game?

1069
01:26:53,582 --> 01:26:54,262
[SPEAKER_41]: Yeah.

1070
01:26:54,322 --> 01:26:55,102
[SPEAKER_41]: There's a Frogger game?

1071
01:26:55,142 --> 01:26:55,423
[SPEAKER_41]: Is this on 360?

1072
01:26:57,364 --> 01:26:58,865
[SPEAKER_41]: No, the original Xbox.

1073
01:26:59,085 --> 01:26:59,165
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh.

1074
01:27:00,552 --> 01:27:03,073
[SPEAKER_32]: Wait, what the hell is this thing all about?

1075
01:27:03,113 --> 01:27:03,633
[SPEAKER_32]: It's not about the 360.

1076
01:27:04,233 --> 01:27:05,374
[SPEAKER_32]: What is this show all about?

1077
01:27:06,394 --> 01:27:09,935
[SPEAKER_41]: It's just trying to do something for gamers.

1078
01:27:09,995 --> 01:27:10,455
[SPEAKER_41]: I don't know.

1079
01:27:10,615 --> 01:27:17,658
[SPEAKER_31]: The question everyone wants to know is why is anyone playing Frogger Ancient Shadows?

1080
01:27:17,678 --> 01:27:18,458
[SPEAKER_31]: That's what I want to know.

1081
01:27:19,178 --> 01:27:21,379
[SPEAKER_38]: Yet another reason to hate Konami of Hawaii.

1082
01:27:22,139 --> 01:27:23,120
[SPEAKER_38]: Did they do that game too?

1083
01:27:23,140 --> 01:27:26,664
[SPEAKER_38]: Man, Hawaii lives off Frogger, dude, like nobody's business.

1084
01:27:26,764 --> 01:27:27,625
[SPEAKER_32]: Dude, people buy it.

1085
01:27:27,865 --> 01:27:28,325
[SPEAKER_32]: You know why?

1086
01:27:28,365 --> 01:27:30,227
[SPEAKER_32]: Because it ends up in the $10 bin at Walmart.

1087
01:27:30,327 --> 01:27:32,429
[SPEAKER_32]: And people go, oh, I'm going to get Frogger for my grandson.

1088
01:27:32,870 --> 01:27:33,851
[SPEAKER_32]: I remember Frogger.

1089
01:27:33,871 --> 01:27:34,872
[SPEAKER_19]: I remember Frogger.

1090
01:27:35,713 --> 01:27:36,533
[SPEAKER_19]: That's a hip game.

1091
01:27:36,554 --> 01:27:38,175
[SPEAKER_19]: That's a bee's knees, that game.

1092
01:27:39,795 --> 01:27:40,335
[SPEAKER_32]: Anyway, sorry.

1093
01:27:40,575 --> 01:27:42,796
[SPEAKER_32]: Was Frogger the bee's knees?

1094
01:27:44,396 --> 01:27:47,677
[SPEAKER_41]: It was a pretty bad game, but whatever, I was stuck playing it.

1095
01:27:49,557 --> 01:27:54,538
[SPEAKER_41]: The other games were like, I think Pac-Man World 3, and then Ultimate Spider-Man.

1096
01:27:54,858 --> 01:27:57,319
[SPEAKER_31]: Oh, I'm glad they threw the Ultimate Spider-Man in there.

1097
01:27:57,339 --> 01:27:59,299
[SPEAKER_31]: I was like, did they get confused?

1098
01:27:59,339 --> 01:28:03,260
[SPEAKER_31]: Did they go off a list of what's hot 1980 or something?

1099
01:28:05,820 --> 01:28:08,321
[SPEAKER_32]: Somebody tell MTV that they got Pac-Man fever.

1100
01:28:09,267 --> 01:28:10,148
[SPEAKER_32]: Um, forget it.

1101
01:28:10,649 --> 01:28:16,636
[SPEAKER_31]: Um, you know Rob, I actually, um, crap, I forgot to bring you a copy of Pac-World 3.

1102
01:28:17,938 --> 01:28:18,819
[SPEAKER_32]: It's okay, it can wait.

1103
01:28:19,199 --> 01:28:21,842
[SPEAKER_31]: I had four of them, two of them have been returned already.

1104
01:28:22,663 --> 01:28:27,389
[SPEAKER_32]: You know, I actually was at Applebee's the other day and heard Pac-Man Fever on the radio and I was like, I thought this song died with it.

1105
01:28:27,529 --> 01:28:28,731
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh wait, I'm sorry, we have a caller online.

1106
01:28:30,601 --> 01:28:31,661
[SPEAKER_32]: Are we going to see you on TV?

1107
01:28:32,801 --> 01:28:34,422
[SPEAKER_32]: Uh, yeah.

1108
01:28:34,442 --> 01:28:36,262
[SPEAKER_32]: Did you flash the OLR gang sign?

1109
01:28:38,423 --> 01:28:46,624
[SPEAKER_41]: No, unfortunately, you know, we couldn't really do much, first of all, but if you had an OLR shirt, I would definitely wear it.

1110
01:28:46,784 --> 01:28:48,205
[SPEAKER_32]: I know, I keep hearing that.

1111
01:28:48,325 --> 01:28:52,165
[SPEAKER_32]: If you only had the OLR shirt, we're working on it.

1112
01:28:52,245 --> 01:28:55,386
[SPEAKER_32]: We need what's called, what do you call it, like a seed money.

1113
01:28:55,766 --> 01:28:58,647
[SPEAKER_32]: We need money to buy the shirts, and then we can sell them.

1114
01:28:58,727 --> 01:28:59,147
[SPEAKER_32]: So that's what...

1115
01:29:00,607 --> 01:29:02,288
[SPEAKER_32]: We do have $25, that's true.

1116
01:29:02,308 --> 01:29:02,728
[SPEAKER_32]: We won $25.

1117
01:29:02,988 --> 01:29:05,930
[SPEAKER_32]: Anyway, anything else you want to say about the MTV taping?

1118
01:29:07,310 --> 01:29:14,053
[SPEAKER_41]: Yeah, there was a brief second half where it was like the actual filming for the countdown they had.

1119
01:29:15,094 --> 01:29:16,934
[SPEAKER_41]: We got free sports games.

1120
01:29:18,135 --> 01:29:18,515
[SPEAKER_32]: Yay.

1121
01:29:18,895 --> 01:29:21,276
[SPEAKER_32]: Yay, which in turn I bet you turned around and sold.

1122
01:29:21,356 --> 01:29:25,738
[SPEAKER_31]: Did they give you like FIFA and like Top Spin or virtual tennis?

1123
01:29:25,798 --> 01:29:27,559
[SPEAKER_31]: All those games that are huge in the U.S.,

1124
01:29:29,205 --> 01:29:32,808
[SPEAKER_41]: Actually, we got NBA 06 and Madden 06.

1125
01:29:33,468 --> 01:29:34,129
[SPEAKER_41]: I mean, 05.

1126
01:29:35,490 --> 01:29:36,090
[SPEAKER_32]: Madden 05?

1127
01:29:36,651 --> 01:29:38,632
[SPEAKER_32]: You got 05 games.

1128
01:29:38,652 --> 01:29:41,975
[SPEAKER_32]: You're unloading the surplus on you guys before they bury them in New Mexico.

1129
01:29:43,254 --> 01:29:45,115
[SPEAKER_41]: Oh, wait, wait, sorry, it is 06.

1130
01:29:45,175 --> 01:29:45,916
[SPEAKER_41]: Oh, it is 06, okay.

1131
01:29:45,996 --> 01:29:47,697
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm a bit behind on that.

1132
01:29:48,218 --> 01:29:49,038
[SPEAKER_32]: It still sucks!

1133
01:29:49,158 --> 01:29:50,539
[SPEAKER_32]: Madden's done!

1134
01:29:50,760 --> 01:29:52,961
[SPEAKER_32]: I mean, give me Genesis Madden!

1135
01:29:53,522 --> 01:29:55,183
[SPEAKER_32]: I'd have rather had Madden 05 than 06.

1136
01:29:56,644 --> 01:29:56,904
[SPEAKER_41]: Anyway.

1137
01:29:57,765 --> 01:30:01,367
[SPEAKER_41]: It's alright, though, because I took them, I went down to Walmart and got full credit for them.

1138
01:30:01,467 --> 01:30:02,088
[SPEAKER_41]: There you go!

1139
01:30:02,448 --> 01:30:03,909
[SPEAKER_32]: There you go, good man, good man.

1140
01:30:04,389 --> 01:30:08,092
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright, we've got to let you go because we've got to get to other calls, but thank you for telling us what's going on.

1141
01:30:08,392 --> 01:30:10,354
[SPEAKER_32]: Now, what are you wearing on the show so we can spot you?

1142
01:30:11,478 --> 01:30:12,900
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm wearing a DDR Freak shirt.

1143
01:30:13,460 --> 01:30:13,760
[SPEAKER_32]: All right.

1144
01:30:14,081 --> 01:30:16,663
[SPEAKER_32]: Even though you're promoting the competition.

1145
01:30:16,703 --> 01:30:17,124
[SPEAKER_32]: No, I'm kidding.

1146
01:30:17,144 --> 01:30:17,904
[SPEAKER_32]: We love DDR Freak.

1147
01:30:18,144 --> 01:30:18,645
[SPEAKER_21]: That's great.

1148
01:30:19,025 --> 01:30:19,346
[SPEAKER_32]: All right.

1149
01:30:20,126 --> 01:30:23,629
[SPEAKER_32]: By the way, the show is Direct Effect.

1150
01:30:24,290 --> 01:30:24,891
[SPEAKER_32]: Direct Effect.

1151
01:30:24,911 --> 01:30:25,952
[SPEAKER_41]: Tomorrow and Tuesday.

1152
01:30:26,212 --> 01:30:27,013
[SPEAKER_41]: Tomorrow and Tuesday.

1153
01:30:27,073 --> 01:30:27,493
[SPEAKER_41]: What time?

1154
01:30:29,195 --> 01:30:29,555
[SPEAKER_41]: Over here.

1155
01:30:29,595 --> 01:30:31,297
[SPEAKER_41]: I know it's on a thing at 7 maybe.

1156
01:30:31,497 --> 01:30:31,797
[SPEAKER_41]: All right.

1157
01:30:31,957 --> 01:30:33,979
[SPEAKER_41]: But either way, just look for Direct Effect.

1158
01:30:34,250 --> 01:30:37,331
[SPEAKER_32]: I'll be sure to set my TiVo.

1159
01:30:38,912 --> 01:30:39,512
[SPEAKER_32]: Take care, buddy.

1160
01:30:39,552 --> 01:30:39,912
[SPEAKER_32]: Have a good one.

1161
01:30:39,932 --> 01:30:40,372
[SPEAKER_32]: Thanks for calling.

1162
01:30:40,852 --> 01:30:41,153
[SPEAKER_41]: You too.

1163
01:30:41,173 --> 01:30:41,353
[SPEAKER_41]: Bye.

1164
01:30:41,413 --> 01:30:41,573
[SPEAKER_32]: Later.

1165
01:30:55,231 --> 01:30:58,053
[SPEAKER_03]: I gotta mute the Windows Media Player.

1166
01:30:58,233 --> 01:30:58,453
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1167
01:30:58,493 --> 01:30:58,813
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't.

1168
01:30:59,714 --> 01:31:00,014
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll wait.

1169
01:31:00,094 --> 01:31:00,794
[SPEAKER_03]: You can put us on hold.

1170
01:31:00,894 --> 01:31:01,335
[SPEAKER_32]: We'll wait.

1171
01:31:02,455 --> 01:31:03,796
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah, don't use Windows Media Player.

1172
01:31:03,836 --> 01:31:04,256
[SPEAKER_32]: Jesus.

1173
01:31:06,818 --> 01:31:07,078
[SPEAKER_32]: Anyway.

1174
01:31:08,119 --> 01:31:08,959
[SPEAKER_32]: What's on your mind, buddy?

1175
01:31:09,339 --> 01:31:10,380
[SPEAKER_32]: Who is this, first off?

1176
01:31:10,760 --> 01:31:11,941
[SPEAKER_32]: This is Xander from Florida.

1177
01:31:12,121 --> 01:31:13,362
[SPEAKER_32]: Hello, Xander from Florida.

1178
01:31:14,102 --> 01:31:14,562
[SPEAKER_03]: What's on your mind?

1179
01:31:17,684 --> 01:31:18,785
[SPEAKER_03]: Dang, this is driving me crazy.

1180
01:31:19,945 --> 01:31:22,467
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I wanted to bring up the Guitar Freaks.

1181
01:31:23,769 --> 01:31:25,670
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, are we talking Guitar Freaks or Guitar Hero?

1182
01:31:26,310 --> 01:31:27,151
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Guitar Hero, sorry.

1183
01:31:27,171 --> 01:31:28,151
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, what's up with Guitar Hero?

1184
01:31:29,092 --> 01:31:46,121
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, actually, I was trying to figure out if I should save my money and go for Beatmania when it comes out, or... Well, here's the way we see it, is that Guitar Hero is out now and costs, what, 70 bucks, I think is how much Guitar Hero costs?

1185
01:31:46,581 --> 01:31:46,881
[SPEAKER_32]: Right.

1186
01:31:46,901 --> 01:31:51,924
[SPEAKER_32]: Beatmania is out, what, the last date we heard is February 8th, I think is what we heard for Beatmania?

1187
01:31:51,944 --> 01:31:52,164
[SPEAKER_32]: February 8th.

1188
01:31:52,921 --> 01:31:55,942
[SPEAKER_32]: February 10th to February 8th, sometime in early February is when that's coming out.

1189
01:31:56,263 --> 01:31:59,924
[SPEAKER_32]: We don't know how much it's going to cost for sure, but let's say it's about the same, $70.

1190
01:32:00,204 --> 01:32:01,645
[SPEAKER_32]: That would seem pretty reasonable, okay?

1191
01:32:02,085 --> 01:32:05,747
[SPEAKER_32]: So the thing is, can you save $70 between now and February?

1192
01:32:08,075 --> 01:32:08,936
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

1193
01:32:26,337 --> 01:32:32,904
[SPEAKER_32]: It feels more like you're playing an actual guitar as opposed to holding something that looks like a guitar and pushing these buttons.

1194
01:32:33,244 --> 01:32:35,827
[SPEAKER_32]: Really the five button thing really adds a lot to it.

1195
01:32:36,027 --> 01:32:46,919
[SPEAKER_32]: And what they do is they do this thing with the fret buttons where you can actually push the fret buttons and it's hard for me to explain but you can push the buttons in order and get the different sounds.

1196
01:32:47,359 --> 01:32:48,740
[SPEAKER_32]: which you couldn't do on Guitar Freaks.

1197
01:32:48,760 --> 01:32:51,942
[SPEAKER_32]: You had to be holding the exact right button combinations or the damn thing didn't work.

1198
01:32:52,562 --> 01:32:56,185
[SPEAKER_32]: And, you know, they did an awesome job in the art direction department.

1199
01:32:56,225 --> 01:33:05,411
[SPEAKER_32]: Let's face it, Guitar Freaks was cool for about the first 75 mixes, but now that they're on, you know, whatever they're on, like Guitar Freaks, Super Duper, Second Mix, whatever they're on.

1200
01:33:05,751 --> 01:33:06,131
[SPEAKER_32]: V2.

1201
01:33:06,532 --> 01:33:07,252
[SPEAKER_32]: V2, thank you.

1202
01:33:07,272 --> 01:33:08,193
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay, whatever the hell they're on.

1203
01:33:08,573 --> 01:33:10,374
[SPEAKER_32]: It's the same damn game.

1204
01:33:10,474 --> 01:33:11,675
[SPEAKER_32]: Nothing has been changed.

1205
01:33:11,715 --> 01:33:13,036
[SPEAKER_32]: It's the same damn interface.

1206
01:33:13,436 --> 01:33:16,418
[SPEAKER_32]: Even though they went up to PlayStation 2, it's the same game.

1207
01:33:16,678 --> 01:33:18,800
[SPEAKER_32]: I don't watch the videos when I play the game!

1208
01:33:28,661 --> 01:33:43,056
[SPEAKER_32]: If you like songs, if you like the J-pop, happy, go lucky, yeah, yeah, yeah songs, then Guitar Freaks is going to be the better game because Guitar Hero is filled with good old-fashioned American butt rock is what's in Guitar Hero.

1209
01:33:43,536 --> 01:33:46,860
[SPEAKER_32]: And so if you like the butt rock, you're going to like this game.

1210
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:49,282
[SPEAKER_32]: When I say butt rock, I mean like, you know, Pantera.

1211
01:33:49,302 --> 01:33:49,643
[SPEAKER_03]: If I don't...

1212
01:33:50,243 --> 01:33:51,884
[SPEAKER_03]: If I don't like that kind of rock, then well...

1213
01:34:20,804 --> 01:34:22,925
[SPEAKER_32]: So, I don't know.

1214
01:34:22,965 --> 01:34:26,367
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just people saying wonderful things about the song list.

1215
01:34:26,447 --> 01:34:29,089
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, well, you know, what if I don't like that style of music?

1216
01:34:29,109 --> 01:34:30,350
[SPEAKER_32]: Then you're not going to like Guitar Hero.

1217
01:34:30,810 --> 01:34:32,892
[SPEAKER_27]: And it's pretty easy to find the song list.

1218
01:34:33,152 --> 01:34:35,914
[SPEAKER_27]: If you go to GuitarHeroGame.com, that's the website.

1219
01:34:35,934 --> 01:34:38,936
[SPEAKER_27]: They've got a song list right on the website, so it's not hard to find it.

1220
01:34:39,315 --> 01:34:58,991
[SPEAKER_32]: But if you are into the Japanese, like if you like trance and stuff, Beatmania, hell, Beatmania's, I don't, we don't know what songs for sure are going to be Beatmania, I mean, we know a few here and there, but rest assured, if it's like any of the other past, what, 1500 mixes they've had in Japan, you're going to have your happy trance and some J-pop, and if that's the kind of music you're into, Beatmania's worth that.

1221
01:35:00,933 --> 01:35:01,193
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1222
01:35:01,433 --> 01:35:02,514
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright, have fun.

1223
01:35:03,695 --> 01:35:04,616
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah, you too.

1224
01:35:04,696 --> 01:35:08,099
[SPEAKER_32]: Keep supporting them music games, because starving programmers need your money, okay?

1225
01:35:10,410 --> 01:35:11,471
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and Roxo's getting it.

1226
01:35:11,971 --> 01:35:12,311
[SPEAKER_32]: All right.

1227
01:35:12,832 --> 01:35:14,012
[SPEAKER_32]: Well, wait, no, no, no, no, no.

1228
01:35:14,573 --> 01:35:15,954
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh, wait, Roxo, oh, for In the Groove?

1229
01:35:16,574 --> 01:35:16,794
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1230
01:35:16,894 --> 01:35:18,155
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh, that's a whole nother thing, man.

1231
01:35:18,175 --> 01:35:18,935
[SPEAKER_32]: That's a whole nother topic.

1232
01:35:18,956 --> 01:35:19,196
[SPEAKER_32]: I know.

1233
01:35:19,216 --> 01:35:20,657
[SPEAKER_03]: I brought it up like a month ago.

1234
01:35:20,677 --> 01:35:20,857
[SPEAKER_32]: I know.

1235
01:35:21,037 --> 01:35:22,898
[SPEAKER_32]: You think I remember each of these shows?

1236
01:35:22,938 --> 01:35:24,759
[SPEAKER_32]: Please, with all the drugs I do, come on.

1237
01:35:25,520 --> 01:35:25,920
[SPEAKER_32]: Just kidding.

1238
01:35:25,940 --> 01:35:26,480
[SPEAKER_32]: Just kidding, kids.

1239
01:35:26,500 --> 01:35:26,941
[SPEAKER_32]: Don't do drugs.

1240
01:35:26,961 --> 01:35:28,842
[SPEAKER_32]: All right, we're going to let you go so we can get to another call, all right?

1241
01:35:29,742 --> 01:35:29,963
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay.

1242
01:35:29,983 --> 01:35:30,563
[SPEAKER_32]: All right, have a good one.

1243
01:35:31,423 --> 01:35:31,684
[SPEAKER_32]: You too.

1244
01:35:31,764 --> 01:35:31,944
[SPEAKER_32]: Later.

1245
01:35:33,979 --> 01:35:34,559
[SPEAKER_32]: Rockstar sucks.

1246
01:35:34,839 --> 01:35:35,220
[SPEAKER_32]: No, I'm kidding.

1247
01:35:35,520 --> 01:35:37,360
[SPEAKER_32]: I just had to drop that.

1248
01:35:37,420 --> 01:35:38,381
[SPEAKER_32]: No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

1249
01:35:39,561 --> 01:35:41,222
[SPEAKER_32]: I just wanted to make somebody angry.

1250
01:35:41,582 --> 01:35:46,464
[SPEAKER_32]: No, you know, in the groove is okay.

1251
01:35:47,825 --> 01:35:49,845
[SPEAKER_32]: I'd like to mention I said nothing.

1252
01:35:50,766 --> 01:35:51,566
[SPEAKER_32]: You were a good boy.

1253
01:35:51,706 --> 01:35:52,607
[SPEAKER_32]: You were a very good boy, Loki.

1254
01:35:52,647 --> 01:35:53,047
[SPEAKER_31]: No, no, no.

1255
01:35:53,087 --> 01:35:54,027
[SPEAKER_32]: Keep playing Mario Kart.

1256
01:35:54,067 --> 01:35:56,068
[SPEAKER_32]: It's keeping you quiet over there.

1257
01:35:56,488 --> 01:35:59,669
[SPEAKER_31]: I've got almost all the races beat in 150cc.

1258
01:36:01,631 --> 01:36:08,133
[SPEAKER_32]: I have to say, I'm strangely looking forward to In the Group 2 on a home console.

1259
01:36:08,373 --> 01:36:13,094
[SPEAKER_32]: I think if they fix a lot of things, I don't know, it might be neat.

1260
01:36:13,474 --> 01:36:13,854
[SPEAKER_32]: We'll see.

1261
01:36:14,434 --> 01:36:15,914
[SPEAKER_31]: It'd be neat when they get sued.

1262
01:36:16,014 --> 01:36:16,674
[SPEAKER_31]: Oh, stop it.

1263
01:36:17,555 --> 01:36:18,275
[SPEAKER_32]: Let's go to another call.

1264
01:36:19,115 --> 01:36:20,795
[SPEAKER_32]: Let's go to this one.

1265
01:36:21,135 --> 01:36:22,076
[SPEAKER_32]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1266
01:36:23,476 --> 01:36:24,576
[SPEAKER_32]: Hey, Sky, speaking here.

1267
01:36:24,856 --> 01:36:27,037
[SPEAKER_32]: Hello, oh, it's our resident 2DX whore.

1268
01:36:27,077 --> 01:36:27,737
[SPEAKER_32]: How are you doing?

1269
01:36:28,632 --> 01:36:29,813
[SPEAKER_32]: Don't you mean 2DX Bastard?

1270
01:36:29,833 --> 01:36:30,173
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh, that's right.

1271
01:36:30,193 --> 01:36:31,553
[SPEAKER_32]: You're a 2DX Bastard, not a whore.

1272
01:36:31,574 --> 01:36:31,974
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm sorry.

1273
01:36:33,374 --> 01:36:36,256
[SPEAKER_32]: Whores imply you're getting paid, which you're not.

1274
01:36:36,536 --> 01:36:37,897
[SPEAKER_32]: You're actually spending a lot of money.

1275
01:36:38,057 --> 01:36:40,338
[SPEAKER_32]: That makes you... I don't know what that makes you, but what's on your mind?

1276
01:36:41,058 --> 01:36:45,821
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, as of last Tuesday, I finally got my copy of Beat Me 2DX 10th Style.

1277
01:36:46,421 --> 01:36:47,221
[SPEAKER_25]: Yay!

1278
01:36:47,862 --> 01:36:48,362
[SPEAKER_09]: How is it?

1279
01:36:49,222 --> 01:36:50,503
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really great.

1280
01:36:51,484 --> 01:36:57,747
[SPEAKER_09]: As a matter of fact, I would like to have my input on... I'd like to give my input on those 7 TS exclusives.

1281
01:36:58,547 --> 01:37:00,287
[SPEAKER_09]: Go for it.

1282
01:37:00,347 --> 01:37:05,348
[SPEAKER_09]: First up is Taito no Suika by Burme Inazawa featuring Shimotsuki Haruka.

1283
01:37:06,028 --> 01:37:13,990
[SPEAKER_09]: The another I would give, you know, on a scale of level 1 to level 12, which level 12 is the most difficult, the another I would give it a level 10.

1284
01:37:15,130 --> 01:37:15,430
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

1285
01:37:16,930 --> 01:37:21,071
[SPEAKER_09]: Next up is, you know, Jelly Kiss Midian Smack Mix.

1286
01:37:22,531 --> 01:37:24,672
[SPEAKER_09]: On 7Key, it stays as it is, it's level 7.

1287
01:37:25,792 --> 01:37:27,995
[SPEAKER_09]: On the another, I would give it a level 10.

1288
01:37:29,037 --> 01:37:29,677
[SPEAKER_32]: Pretty hard, huh?

1289
01:37:30,258 --> 01:37:30,719
[SPEAKER_09]: Pretty hard.

1290
01:37:32,461 --> 01:37:34,063
[SPEAKER_32]: I have to ask you, what do you think about that anyway?

1291
01:37:34,083 --> 01:37:36,887
[SPEAKER_32]: Because you're pretty loyal to all the Japanese mixes that come out.

1292
01:37:36,907 --> 01:37:40,652
[SPEAKER_32]: What do you think about that US song crossing over into Japan?

1293
01:37:40,672 --> 01:37:41,373
[SPEAKER_32]: What do you think about that?

1294
01:37:41,874 --> 01:37:43,334
[SPEAKER_09]: I was quite surprised, actually.

1295
01:37:43,615 --> 01:37:44,615
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah, I was surprised, too.

1296
01:37:44,675 --> 01:37:51,317
[SPEAKER_32]: But we actually have an interview with MiniHead in this week's podcast, and it's pretty interesting because I kind of ask him right about this, too.

1297
01:37:51,417 --> 01:37:53,478
[SPEAKER_32]: So you'll have to tune in to hear what he has to say.

1298
01:37:53,578 --> 01:37:54,118
[SPEAKER_32]: So it's kind of neat.

1299
01:37:54,338 --> 01:37:56,619
[SPEAKER_32]: Anyway, go ahead.

1300
01:37:56,979 --> 01:37:57,379
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.

1301
01:37:57,519 --> 01:37:58,219
[SPEAKER_09]: Hype the core?

1302
01:37:58,239 --> 01:38:00,180
[SPEAKER_09]: On 7K, I would give it a level 9.

1303
01:38:03,761 --> 01:38:06,382
[SPEAKER_09]: On the another, it should be a level 12.

1304
01:38:06,602 --> 01:38:07,863
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really the hardest one.

1305
01:38:09,163 --> 01:38:09,923
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

1306
01:38:11,444 --> 01:38:15,145
[SPEAKER_09]: Exian, yeah, I did a Tatsujin video on that.

1307
01:38:15,986 --> 01:38:19,667
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, what's really weird is it doesn't really look like a level 8.

1308
01:38:20,888 --> 01:38:21,888
[SPEAKER_09]: I should really give it a level 7.

1309
01:38:22,848 --> 01:38:23,128
[SPEAKER_32]: Really?

1310
01:38:24,029 --> 01:38:24,269
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1311
01:38:24,729 --> 01:38:29,371
[SPEAKER_32]: I like hearing that, though, because that means it'll be a hard song I can beat.

1312
01:38:29,691 --> 01:38:32,612
[SPEAKER_09]: And on the another, I give it a level 8, as it is.

1313
01:38:35,142 --> 01:38:40,346
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, let's see, what else, uh, Satellite020712 from Coded Arms.

1314
01:38:41,748 --> 01:38:47,052
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, it's level 8, it stays as it is, on 7 key, on the another, I give it a level 11.

1315
01:38:47,092 --> 01:38:47,312
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1316
01:38:47,372 --> 01:38:50,615
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, you didn't know they had Coded Arms in there?

1317
01:38:51,115 --> 01:38:52,236
[SPEAKER_31]: No, I didn't.

1318
01:38:52,416 --> 01:38:53,277
[SPEAKER_31]: I turned off the mic.

1319
01:38:53,317 --> 01:38:59,482
[SPEAKER_31]: I didn't realize they had that, no, what they needed was, um, I want to say it was Radar Rider, something like that, or, um.

1320
01:39:01,274 --> 01:39:02,675
[SPEAKER_32]: They're crossing over from their other franchises.

1321
01:39:02,795 --> 01:39:03,176
[SPEAKER_32]: Good stuff.

1322
01:39:03,216 --> 01:39:05,598
[SPEAKER_32]: They had Rumble Roses music in Ultramix 3.

1323
01:39:06,018 --> 01:39:06,378
[SPEAKER_32]: That's good.

1324
01:39:06,638 --> 01:39:06,959
[SPEAKER_32]: Interesting.

1325
01:39:07,019 --> 01:39:07,879
[SPEAKER_32]: Anyway, go ahead.

1326
01:39:09,661 --> 01:39:16,986
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me check my tent style here and give my personal opinion on the 7 CS exclusives.

1327
01:39:17,146 --> 01:39:19,468
[SPEAKER_09]: How many CS exclusives have I already mentioned so far?

1328
01:39:19,488 --> 01:39:22,270
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, Suica and Satellite 00712?

1329
01:39:26,553 --> 01:39:29,775
[SPEAKER_09]: I think you're missing Strong Woman and... Strong Woman, oh yeah.

1330
01:39:30,335 --> 01:39:33,137
[SPEAKER_09]: I give it, you know, on the another, I give it a level 8.

1331
01:39:34,657 --> 01:39:34,958
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1332
01:39:35,898 --> 01:39:37,079
[SPEAKER_09]: Because of the chords.

1333
01:39:37,639 --> 01:39:42,141
[SPEAKER_09]: Even though it's 95 BPM, which is really, really slow, I had a rough time.

1334
01:39:42,422 --> 01:39:43,542
[SPEAKER_32]: Sounds a little bit like War Game.

1335
01:39:44,823 --> 01:39:45,063
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1336
01:39:45,083 --> 01:39:45,463
[SPEAKER_09]: A little bit.

1337
01:39:45,623 --> 01:39:45,823
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1338
01:39:45,843 --> 01:39:46,764
[SPEAKER_09]: A little bit.

1339
01:39:47,144 --> 01:39:51,807
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think the last one, hmm, what was it again?

1340
01:39:52,827 --> 01:39:54,068
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, Acid Vision, here we go.

1341
01:39:54,088 --> 01:39:55,809
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, very, very good song.

1342
01:39:56,654 --> 01:40:01,952
[SPEAKER_09]: level 8 stays as it is on 7 key and on the another I give it a level 10

1343
01:40:02,894 --> 01:40:03,114
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

1344
01:40:03,915 --> 01:40:05,595
[SPEAKER_09]: What are your thoughts about TenStyle overall?

1345
01:40:06,536 --> 01:40:07,896
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, it's really, really good.

1346
01:40:09,297 --> 01:40:16,060
[SPEAKER_09]: They just, you know, they just released, you know, they just put in a judge mode in which you can see how many perfect grades and greets that you have.

1347
01:40:17,480 --> 01:40:17,960
[SPEAKER_09]: What else?

1348
01:40:18,581 --> 01:40:24,863
[SPEAKER_09]: They have, you know, the DJ point, and yeah, Sakurina, one more lovely, Onage.

1349
01:40:26,364 --> 01:40:26,744
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright.

1350
01:40:28,245 --> 01:40:30,165
[SPEAKER_32]: Any other words for our listeners before we let you go?

1351
01:40:30,185 --> 01:40:31,386
[SPEAKER_32]: We've got to get to another call, but...

1352
01:40:32,281 --> 01:40:35,903
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I just want to say, go get TenStyle.

1353
01:40:36,783 --> 01:40:37,103
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright.

1354
01:40:38,324 --> 01:40:41,225
[SPEAKER_32]: I actually plan on getting it as soon as I get a new controller.

1355
01:40:41,645 --> 01:40:42,405
[SPEAKER_32]: Which will be very soon.

1356
01:40:42,685 --> 01:40:48,168
[SPEAKER_32]: Because I've heard the rumors that Konami's putting out a new one for the US, as I'm sure we all have, but we'll see.

1357
01:40:48,248 --> 01:40:49,728
[SPEAKER_32]: And if it's true, I'm definitely getting one.

1358
01:40:50,269 --> 01:40:50,589
[SPEAKER_32]: So we'll see.

1359
01:40:51,519 --> 01:41:00,204
[SPEAKER_09]: Go watch my Tatsujin videos, Desolation Another, Don't Forget Another, and the Exe in 70 that I did.

1360
01:41:00,444 --> 01:41:08,128
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll post it online, the site that has the Tatsujin videos that I have.

1361
01:41:08,349 --> 01:41:09,549
[SPEAKER_32]: Absolutely, put a link in our chatroom.

1362
01:41:10,950 --> 01:41:12,431
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, take care buddy.

1363
01:41:13,251 --> 01:41:13,872
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright, later.

1364
01:41:13,972 --> 01:41:14,152
[SPEAKER_32]: Later.

1365
01:41:15,414 --> 01:41:21,299
[SPEAKER_32]: One more call, you guys, and we're getting hammered tonight, so if we don't get to your call, I'm really sorry, we're almost out of time.

1366
01:41:21,799 --> 01:41:25,822
[SPEAKER_32]: We'll try to get more calls in a little later during the show, however, we're going to do one more.

1367
01:41:26,383 --> 01:41:27,724
[SPEAKER_32]: Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1368
01:41:30,306 --> 01:41:30,626
[SPEAKER_26]: Hi.

1369
01:41:30,987 --> 01:41:31,807
[SPEAKER_32]: Hi, who's this?

1370
01:41:33,028 --> 01:41:33,769
[SPEAKER_26]: This is Roz.

1371
01:41:33,909 --> 01:41:35,130
[SPEAKER_32]: Hi, Roz, how are you?

1372
01:41:40,294 --> 01:41:41,575
[SPEAKER_32]: That sounds a little iffy to me.

1373
01:41:42,625 --> 01:41:45,387
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, I had an interesting weekend.

1374
01:41:45,648 --> 01:41:46,729
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay, do tell.

1375
01:41:46,769 --> 01:41:48,210
[SPEAKER_32]: What happened on your interesting weekend?

1376
01:41:49,251 --> 01:41:55,356
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, well, my dad has been in Mexico all week, and he just got back on Friday night.

1377
01:41:55,676 --> 01:41:55,997
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

1378
01:41:56,858 --> 01:42:03,423
[SPEAKER_26]: And as some of you may know, I was in a school play on Friday and Saturday evening.

1379
01:42:03,804 --> 01:42:04,064
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

1380
01:42:05,854 --> 01:42:09,315
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, he gets back Friday night after the play.

1381
01:42:09,515 --> 01:42:10,375
[SPEAKER_26]: Missed the first night.

1382
01:42:10,515 --> 01:42:12,396
[SPEAKER_26]: That's alright, after you beat the next night.

1383
01:42:14,116 --> 01:42:17,898
[SPEAKER_26]: Uh, Saturday morning, I wake up.

1384
01:42:18,358 --> 01:42:24,860
[SPEAKER_26]: I apparently had some kind of horrible allergic reaction to the makeup that they used on my face.

1385
01:42:25,180 --> 01:42:26,000
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh no!

1386
01:42:27,392 --> 01:42:31,953
[SPEAKER_26]: So I looked and felt sunburnt the whole day, and still do.

1387
01:42:32,573 --> 01:42:39,014
[SPEAKER_32]: But that wasn't something that they found out before the play went, like you guys didn't do like a full-on dress rehearsal or anything, or?

1388
01:42:39,934 --> 01:42:40,114
[SPEAKER_26]: No.

1389
01:42:42,495 --> 01:42:46,635
[SPEAKER_26]: No, definitely, we didn't do a dress rehearsal, we just kind of went into it.

1390
01:42:46,835 --> 01:42:48,796
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh no, okay.

1391
01:42:49,096 --> 01:42:51,976
[SPEAKER_26]: So, yeah, I looked angry.

1392
01:42:54,077 --> 01:42:56,217
[SPEAKER_32]: So did you end up doing the play on Saturday anyway?

1393
01:42:57,768 --> 01:43:09,714
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, on Saturday, I left for the play, you know, went there, and the play actually went great, so that was good.

1394
01:43:09,754 --> 01:43:15,136
[SPEAKER_26]: You know, my dad didn't go the second night because he was sick, and I didn't realize how sick he was.

1395
01:43:15,156 --> 01:43:16,157
[SPEAKER_22]: Uh-oh.

1396
01:43:16,957 --> 01:43:19,379
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, I'm going to say, I think he drank the water.

1397
01:43:21,110 --> 01:43:22,573
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh no, in Mexico.

1398
01:43:23,815 --> 01:43:32,772
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, so I was at the cast party, which was half-assed because there were only like four people at the party.

1399
01:43:33,905 --> 01:43:39,267
[SPEAKER_26]: And we're talking, you know, we're talking about getting flowers from our parents, and I'm like, yeah, I didn't get any.

1400
01:43:40,747 --> 01:43:47,569
[SPEAKER_26]: And my sister leads me off to the side, and she's like, here's why we didn't get you flowers.

1401
01:43:48,469 --> 01:43:51,410
[SPEAKER_26]: Because we found Dad laying on the bathroom floor.

1402
01:43:53,051 --> 01:43:58,052
[SPEAKER_32]: And... This is starting to sound more and more like an early FU of the week, in a way.

1403
01:43:58,092 --> 01:44:01,493
[SPEAKER_32]: Like, this whole thing is just like, oh my gosh, I'd be so pissed.

1404
01:44:02,799 --> 01:44:05,020
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, I was pretty pissed off about it.

1405
01:44:05,920 --> 01:44:10,341
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm still pretty pissed off about it because he missed both nights because he was in Mexico.

1406
01:44:12,361 --> 01:44:13,122
[SPEAKER_32]: Well, here you go.

1407
01:44:13,542 --> 01:44:15,062
[SPEAKER_32]: You're in our chat room right now, right?

1408
01:44:16,042 --> 01:44:16,242
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah.

1409
01:44:16,382 --> 01:44:17,283
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay, here's what I'm going to do.

1410
01:44:17,303 --> 01:44:18,663
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm going to draw this on there.

1411
01:44:19,123 --> 01:44:22,704
[SPEAKER_32]: I sent you a cyber flower there in the IRC room.

1412
01:44:23,893 --> 01:44:24,053
[SPEAKER_26]: Aw.

1413
01:44:24,433 --> 01:44:25,114
[SPEAKER_26]: So there you go.

1414
01:44:25,174 --> 01:44:25,754
[SPEAKER_26]: We have you.

1415
01:44:27,395 --> 01:44:27,775
[SPEAKER_32]: All right.

1416
01:44:27,995 --> 01:44:29,196
[SPEAKER_26]: F you, PoePanda.

1417
01:44:30,196 --> 01:44:30,916
[SPEAKER_26]: Shut the hell up.

1418
01:44:31,197 --> 01:44:32,957
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm giving you the finger through my screen.

1419
01:44:33,017 --> 01:44:34,538
[SPEAKER_32]: People are just mad because they didn't get through.

1420
01:44:34,598 --> 01:44:35,158
[SPEAKER_32]: Don't listen to them.

1421
01:44:35,519 --> 01:44:37,559
[SPEAKER_32]: We're going to take more calls later if we can.

1422
01:44:37,620 --> 01:44:38,420
[SPEAKER_32]: People are just angsty.

1423
01:44:38,740 --> 01:44:41,501
[SPEAKER_32]: Anyway, anything else you want to share, though, before we get on the next topic?

1424
01:44:48,344 --> 01:44:49,005
[SPEAKER_26]: Good question.

1425
01:44:51,877 --> 01:44:54,499
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm going to say probably not.

1426
01:44:54,939 --> 01:44:55,259
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright.

1427
01:44:55,399 --> 01:44:56,780
[SPEAKER_32]: Well, Roz, thanks so much for calling in.

1428
01:44:56,820 --> 01:44:59,262
[SPEAKER_32]: I hope your week is better than your weekend was, okay?

1429
01:44:59,722 --> 01:45:01,624
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, and vote for my song on Cage Match.

1430
01:45:01,884 --> 01:45:04,586
[SPEAKER_26]: Sakura said that she was using one of my songs.

1431
01:45:04,886 --> 01:45:05,306
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh, really?

1432
01:45:05,326 --> 01:45:06,407
[SPEAKER_26]: So vote for it, damn it.

1433
01:45:06,627 --> 01:45:07,087
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh, really?

1434
01:45:07,528 --> 01:45:07,888
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright.

1435
01:45:08,068 --> 01:45:08,928
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay, well, we'll see.

1436
01:45:09,049 --> 01:45:09,689
[SPEAKER_32]: We'll see how it goes.

1437
01:45:10,249 --> 01:45:10,570
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright.

1438
01:45:11,030 --> 01:45:11,410
[SPEAKER_26]: Take care.

1439
01:45:12,031 --> 01:45:12,311
[SPEAKER_32]: Bye-bye.

1440
01:45:14,268 --> 01:45:14,649
[SPEAKER_32]: All right.

1441
01:45:14,709 --> 01:45:21,555
[SPEAKER_32]: Now, once again, we will open up the Skype line a little later, probably more towards the end of the show, because we want to bring DarkSakura back at some point as well.

1442
01:45:22,375 --> 01:45:25,618
[SPEAKER_32]: But we're running behind on our other stuff and the stuff we've got to get to this week.

1443
01:45:26,219 --> 01:45:32,424
[SPEAKER_32]: And, of course, you know it just wouldn't be a show if we didn't have ourselves a little bit of a cage match.

1444
01:45:35,126 --> 01:45:35,467
[SPEAKER_32]: All right.

1445
01:45:36,127 --> 01:45:36,327
[SPEAKER_32]: Now...

1446
01:45:37,779 --> 01:45:41,242
[SPEAKER_32]: Since we weren't live last week, we didn't end up having a cage match last week.

1447
01:45:42,303 --> 01:45:45,685
[SPEAKER_32]: So we have one that's actually a holdover from two weeks ago.

1448
01:45:45,745 --> 01:45:48,548
[SPEAKER_32]: So technically it by default wins last week.

1449
01:45:48,588 --> 01:45:50,449
[SPEAKER_32]: So it's going to be in its third week if it wins.

1450
01:45:51,690 --> 01:45:53,292
[SPEAKER_32]: The song is by Depeche Mode.

1451
01:45:53,792 --> 01:45:58,476
[SPEAKER_32]: And it's from their brand new album, which is called... I don't know what it's called.

1452
01:45:58,496 --> 01:45:59,397
[SPEAKER_32]: I don't remember what it's called.

1453
01:45:59,417 --> 01:46:00,477
[SPEAKER_32]: I think it's Playing the Angel.

1454
01:46:02,479 --> 01:46:03,360
[SPEAKER_32]: The new Depeche Mode album.

1455
01:46:03,380 --> 01:46:04,361
[SPEAKER_32]: I think it's called Playing the Angel.

1456
01:46:04,401 --> 01:46:05,301
[SPEAKER_32]: Yes, it's called Playing the Angel.

1457
01:46:05,842 --> 01:46:06,963
[SPEAKER_32]: The song is called Precious.

1458
01:46:07,483 --> 01:46:08,483
[SPEAKER_32]: And it's our winner.

1459
01:46:09,183 --> 01:46:13,224
[SPEAKER_32]: Remember the way the Cage Match works is that we play three songs for you guys.

1460
01:46:13,244 --> 01:46:17,426
[SPEAKER_32]: We play a clip of the previous winner and two new songs in full for you guys.

1461
01:46:17,706 --> 01:46:25,688
[SPEAKER_32]: You guys vote for your favorite in our chatroom at OrangeLoungeRadio.com and that winner goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's Video Game Music and More program.

1462
01:46:26,088 --> 01:46:28,348
[SPEAKER_32]: Here it is, song number one tonight in the Cage Match.

1463
01:46:28,408 --> 01:46:30,269
[SPEAKER_32]: A clip of Precious by Depeche Mode.

1464
01:46:32,069 --> 01:46:35,110
[SPEAKER_21]: My God, what have we done to you?

1465
01:46:41,218 --> 01:46:52,221
[SPEAKER_16]: We always tried to share The tenderest of care Now look what we have

1466
01:47:10,826 --> 01:47:16,128
There was a little left to give Angels with silver wings Should have no suffering

1467
01:47:40,660 --> 01:47:42,901
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for watching!

1468
01:48:12,518 --> 01:48:15,705
[SPEAKER_21]: I thought we'd vanish, but what left us

1469
01:48:29,540 --> 01:48:33,222
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay, that was song number one in tonight's cage match, Depeche Mode with Precious.

1470
01:48:33,242 --> 01:48:35,243
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright, we're going to get into song number two now.

1471
01:48:35,283 --> 01:48:39,725
[SPEAKER_32]: This is actually DarkSakura's pick, and unfortunately she's unable to call us back right now and intro it herself.

1472
01:48:40,105 --> 01:48:50,571
[SPEAKER_32]: But from what we understand, it sounds like Roz has something to do with this pick, so maybe she's doing that trick that I did last month when I had Miklatop pick one of my songs, and it went all the way to retirement.

1473
01:48:50,931 --> 01:48:51,571
[SPEAKER_32]: So we'll see.

1474
01:48:51,912 --> 01:48:53,612
[SPEAKER_32]: Will DarkSakura have the same luck?

1475
01:48:53,652 --> 01:48:54,113
[SPEAKER_32]: We'll see.

1476
01:48:54,453 --> 01:48:57,615
[SPEAKER_32]: Song number two is Tally Hall by Banana Man.

1477
01:48:58,075 --> 01:48:58,355
[SPEAKER_32]: Enjoy.

1478
01:49:05,504 --> 01:49:30,861
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you see Banana Man Hopping over on the white hot sand Here he come with some for me Freshly taken from Banana Tree Banana Man me want a ton Give me double and a bonus one Give me more for all me friends These banana flowin' never end

1479
01:49:38,851 --> 01:49:40,813
[SPEAKER_16]: You want a banana?

1480
01:49:41,834 --> 01:49:43,817
[SPEAKER_16]: This banana for you.

1481
01:49:44,698 --> 01:49:47,781
[SPEAKER_16]: Tonight we dance around this flame.

1482
01:49:48,622 --> 01:49:51,505
Then we get to play the spirit game.

1483
01:49:51,625 --> 01:49:54,749
Spirit names we shout out loud.

1484
01:49:55,249 --> 01:49:57,952
Shake the thunder from the spirit cloud.

1485
01:49:58,493 --> 01:49:59,354
All this song burns.

1486
01:50:03,736 --> 01:50:05,778
Thank you for watching!

1487
01:50:29,444 --> 01:50:53,310
[SPEAKER_16]: Look you, you're too uptight, you know You could laugh and kick it back and go But without a rhythm or a rhyme You do not banana all the time Fly away from city on the run Try to make a little fun Look you, come to the bungalow I've heard that you tell me don't you so Don't you love me bumping up the drum Make a shake until the bum go down Let the bum go play until you drop This banana never

1488
01:51:04,838 --> 01:51:06,319
[SPEAKER_15]: Fungale, Fungalo, make up your mind

1489
01:51:39,921 --> 01:51:55,219
[SPEAKER_16]: Well it's nine o'clock and it's getting dark and the sun is falling from the sky I've never left so early and you may wonder why

1490
01:52:09,116 --> 01:52:10,899
Thank you for watching!

1491
01:52:32,198 --> 01:52:43,983
No banana make you go insane Looking back to busy town No banana make you want to frown Do you want a banana?

1492
01:52:44,003 --> 01:52:46,504
Feel it now Do you want a banana?

1493
01:52:46,524 --> 01:52:47,425
This banana for...

1494
01:52:59,068 --> 01:52:59,229
[SPEAKER_21]: You...

1495
01:53:25,526 --> 01:53:30,207
[SPEAKER_32]: Song number two in tonight's cage match, Tally Howe with Banana Man.

1496
01:53:30,247 --> 01:53:35,168
[SPEAKER_32]: Let's go around and see if that song is banana-rific or if it's just plain rotten.

1497
01:53:36,129 --> 01:53:36,249
[SPEAKER_32]: Angel.

1498
01:53:36,269 --> 01:53:38,989
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know if it's the only one that started giggling when it started playing.

1499
01:53:39,009 --> 01:53:39,430
[SPEAKER_25]: I was like, oh my god!

1500
01:53:39,450 --> 01:53:40,890
[SPEAKER_32]: You're the only one that's seen the video, apparently.

1501
01:53:41,130 --> 01:53:41,630
[SPEAKER_32]: Of course.

1502
01:53:41,750 --> 01:53:42,190
[SPEAKER_32]: What'd you think?

1503
01:53:42,670 --> 01:53:47,812
[SPEAKER_24]: Um... Yeah, it's kind of really great, you know, it's a music video.

1504
01:53:47,872 --> 01:53:47,992
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

1505
01:53:48,012 --> 01:53:48,912
[SPEAKER_24]: But, um...

1506
01:53:50,149 --> 01:53:54,752
[SPEAKER_25]: I just don't think it's a 10 just because it's funny, but what the hell, I'll give it a 10.

1507
01:53:54,892 --> 01:53:55,493
[SPEAKER_25]: Melody!

1508
01:54:19,542 --> 01:54:22,903
[SPEAKER_21]: I, I, I just don't get it.

1509
01:54:23,703 --> 01:54:27,703
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, okay, I'll post the video in my live journal so everyone can get it.

1510
01:54:27,923 --> 01:54:28,844
[SPEAKER_25]: Of course it doesn't!

1511
01:54:30,104 --> 01:54:30,684
[SPEAKER_25]: For later!

1512
01:54:31,784 --> 01:54:39,365
[SPEAKER_38]: I give it an F. Um, if Lince the Funny could say a thing, she would say, that banana was shit.

1513
01:54:40,146 --> 01:54:41,266
[SPEAKER_38]: I give it a 1.

1514
01:54:43,466 --> 01:54:48,207
[SPEAKER_31]: Loki, I'm sorry, but the cage match does not require video, so...

1515
01:54:48,891 --> 01:54:52,575
[SPEAKER_31]: Based on the song alone, it sucked balls and it gets a 1.

1516
01:54:52,615 --> 01:54:54,237
[SPEAKER_31]: Alright.

1517
01:54:55,238 --> 01:54:58,361
[SPEAKER_32]: And DarkSakura is actually in chat right now.

1518
01:54:58,401 --> 01:54:59,122
[SPEAKER_32]: She's yelling at me.

1519
01:54:59,162 --> 01:55:00,043
[SPEAKER_32]: She gives it a score of 11T.

1520
01:55:00,263 --> 01:55:02,706
[SPEAKER_32]: And it says, ba-na-na.

1521
01:55:03,723 --> 01:55:06,303
[SPEAKER_32]: Unfortunately, 11T is not a number, therefore it's zero.

1522
01:55:07,064 --> 01:55:07,484
[SPEAKER_32]: Stop.

1523
01:55:08,944 --> 01:55:10,424
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright.

1524
01:55:11,324 --> 01:55:11,985
[SPEAKER_32]: Moving on.

1525
01:55:12,265 --> 01:55:14,325
[SPEAKER_32]: Song number three in tonight's cage match.

1526
01:55:14,385 --> 01:55:16,125
[SPEAKER_32]: Loki, what the hell did you bring to the table today?

1527
01:55:16,145 --> 01:55:21,826
[SPEAKER_31]: I don't even remember if I put this in the cage match or not, but this song sounds like a good song that would be for a guitar hero.

1528
01:55:22,246 --> 01:55:23,147
[SPEAKER_31]: It's like a kick-ass song.

1529
01:55:23,427 --> 01:55:29,588
[SPEAKER_31]: It features a guitarist by the name of John Sykes, who is also in Whitesnake and some other bands.

1530
01:55:30,048 --> 01:55:30,568
[SPEAKER_31]: So, um...

1531
01:55:31,277 --> 01:55:32,779
[SPEAKER_32]: This is actually a theme song to an anime.

1532
01:55:32,959 --> 01:55:34,962
[SPEAKER_32]: White Snake sounds awesome to me.

1533
01:55:35,062 --> 01:55:36,043
[SPEAKER_32]: So, it's badass.

1534
01:55:36,284 --> 01:55:38,126
[SPEAKER_32]: John Sykes with Cautionary Warning.

1535
01:55:39,107 --> 01:55:39,307
[SPEAKER_32]: Yes.

1536
01:55:39,468 --> 01:55:39,888
[SPEAKER_32]: Here it is.

1537
01:55:39,968 --> 01:55:40,389
[SPEAKER_32]: And short.

1538
01:55:40,689 --> 01:55:41,350
[SPEAKER_32]: Enjoy, kids.

1539
01:57:58,413 --> 01:57:59,393
Thank you for watching!

1540
01:59:11,178 --> 01:59:14,679
[SPEAKER_32]: Song number three is John Sykes with Cautionary Warning.

1541
01:59:14,739 --> 01:59:17,060
[SPEAKER_32]: Let's go around and see what everybody thought of that one.

1542
01:59:17,640 --> 01:59:17,940
[SPEAKER_32]: Angel.

1543
01:59:21,861 --> 01:59:22,342
[SPEAKER_25]: It was good.

1544
01:59:22,362 --> 01:59:25,362
[SPEAKER_25]: Eight and a half.

1545
01:59:26,983 --> 01:59:28,984
[SPEAKER_32]: It was no Whitesnake, that's for damn sure.

1546
01:59:29,104 --> 01:59:29,444
[SPEAKER_32]: Five.

1547
01:59:29,984 --> 01:59:30,364
[SPEAKER_32]: Melody.

1548
01:59:31,124 --> 01:59:33,565
[SPEAKER_27]: That was freaking cool and now I want to go play Guitar Hero.

1549
01:59:34,325 --> 01:59:35,386
[SPEAKER_27]: Nine.

1550
01:59:36,206 --> 01:59:36,466
[SPEAKER_32]: Mel.

1551
01:59:38,855 --> 01:59:40,736
[SPEAKER_38]: DarkSakura says you get an automatic zero for being rude earlier.

1552
02:00:07,315 --> 02:00:08,416
[SPEAKER_32]: Don't pick crappy songs then.

1553
02:00:09,237 --> 02:00:10,318
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh snap.

1554
02:00:10,578 --> 02:00:11,158
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh snap.

1555
02:00:12,019 --> 02:00:14,741
[SPEAKER_32]: I gave her song a higher score than I gave your song.

1556
02:00:14,761 --> 02:00:15,983
[SPEAKER_32]: That was not white.

1557
02:00:16,023 --> 02:00:21,327
[SPEAKER_32]: You misrepresented that song by making me think it would be like White Snake.

1558
02:00:21,667 --> 02:00:23,009
[SPEAKER_32]: I said he was in White Snake.

1559
02:00:23,069 --> 02:00:24,910
[SPEAKER_32]: I didn't say he was like White Snake.

1560
02:00:24,930 --> 02:00:25,851
[SPEAKER_32]: Misrepresent.

1561
02:00:25,951 --> 02:00:27,432
[SPEAKER_32]: I demand a free trial.

1562
02:00:28,153 --> 02:00:28,433
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright.

1563
02:00:29,714 --> 02:00:32,397
[SPEAKER_32]: Let's recap the three songs you can vote for tonight, shall we?

1564
02:00:33,592 --> 02:00:40,994
[SPEAKER_32]: Let's start off with song number one that you can vote for tonight is Depeche Mode with Precious.

1565
02:00:41,074 --> 02:00:43,314
[SPEAKER_32]: If I can find it in my list here.

1566
02:00:44,995 --> 02:00:48,176
[SPEAKER_32]: That worries me that I cannot suddenly find Depeche Mode with Precious.

1567
02:00:48,196 --> 02:00:48,696
[SPEAKER_32]: Here we go.

1568
02:00:49,376 --> 02:00:49,836
[SPEAKER_32]: Let's try this again.

1569
02:00:49,856 --> 02:00:51,536
[SPEAKER_32]: Song number one was Precious by Depeche Mode.

1570
02:00:52,377 --> 02:00:54,537
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's start with Depeche Mode.

1571
02:00:59,163 --> 02:01:12,279
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright, song number two you can vote for tonight is Tally Hall with Banana Man And song number three you can vote for tonight is John Sykes with Cautionary Warning

1572
02:01:26,209 --> 02:01:28,750
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright kids, place, vote now.

1573
02:01:28,851 --> 02:01:34,314
[SPEAKER_32]: Send a private message to Sky with your vote for song number one, song number two, or, if you're so inclined, song number three.

1574
02:01:34,694 --> 02:01:35,274
[SPEAKER_32]: It's your choice.

1575
02:01:35,494 --> 02:01:36,435
[SPEAKER_32]: Send a vote in right now.

1576
02:01:36,495 --> 02:01:37,315
[SPEAKER_32]: Private message, Sky.

1577
02:01:37,375 --> 02:01:37,655
[SPEAKER_32]: Do it!

1578
02:01:39,336 --> 02:01:39,597
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright.

1579
02:01:40,377 --> 02:01:42,658
[SPEAKER_32]: Meanwhile, let's go over to Loki real quick.

1580
02:01:42,878 --> 02:01:45,360
[SPEAKER_31]: What is going on in the sim scene, if I dare ask?

1581
02:01:45,680 --> 02:01:46,160
[SPEAKER_31]: A few things.

1582
02:01:47,181 --> 02:01:54,245
[SPEAKER_31]: The first being really cool, and that would be PSP Revolution, and it's basically kind of a port of Step Mania for the PSP.

1583
02:01:54,972 --> 02:01:57,093
[SPEAKER_31]: and you can play your sim files on that.

1584
02:01:57,454 --> 02:02:04,198
[SPEAKER_31]: The only thing it doesn't support right now is modifiers, so that's not in there, but at least it plays and it works, and it's pretty fun.

1585
02:02:04,538 --> 02:02:07,680
[SPEAKER_31]: But, you know, best you can do with Controller Controller Revolution, so.

1586
02:02:09,101 --> 02:02:12,643
[SPEAKER_31]: You can actually download that, we have a link on our website to where you can download that.

1587
02:02:13,043 --> 02:02:17,046
[SPEAKER_31]: It's pretty awesome, it actually comes with a couple sim file packs in there, so you can check out some songs.

1588
02:02:18,307 --> 02:02:21,369
[SPEAKER_31]: But yeah, so far, not bad for a first release, and...

1589
02:02:23,360 --> 02:02:24,501
[SPEAKER_31]: That's pretty much about it.

1590
02:02:24,781 --> 02:02:25,742
[SPEAKER_31]: All the important stuff, at least.

1591
02:02:46,944 --> 02:02:51,267
[SPEAKER_32]: We like to sometimes watch a movie together and comment on it for you guys.

1592
02:02:51,688 --> 02:03:02,037
[SPEAKER_32]: And the movie we're going to be commenting on this week is a news article that was recently, or actually not really an article, a news broadcast that was recently on our local television station.

1593
02:03:02,077 --> 02:03:10,445
[SPEAKER_32]: It was WB58, and it was Loki and DarkSakura lending their expert opinions on Guitar Hero.

1594
02:03:10,965 --> 02:03:12,166
[SPEAKER_32]: So let's check this out, shall we?

1595
02:03:12,186 --> 02:03:13,566
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm going to bring up this video in studio.

1596
02:03:13,806 --> 02:03:18,969
[SPEAKER_32]: But of course, for those of you guys out there in internet radio land, you guys will get to hear the audio of this.

1597
02:03:19,369 --> 02:03:21,330
[SPEAKER_32]: And we will interject as need be with comments.

1598
02:03:23,199 --> 02:03:23,539
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1599
02:03:23,619 --> 02:03:24,700
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, a question I have for you.

1600
02:03:24,740 --> 02:03:28,822
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you ever secretly dreamed of being a rock star, wailing on your electric guitar?

1601
02:03:29,122 --> 02:03:30,403
[SPEAKER_02]: I dream of that every night.

1602
02:03:31,803 --> 02:03:35,465
[SPEAKER_32]: Actually, there's nothing I love more than getting up on the bed and wailing like a rock star.

1603
02:03:35,665 --> 02:03:36,446
[SPEAKER_32]: Sold out crowd.

1604
02:03:36,926 --> 02:03:40,968
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, for most people, the closest they'll ever get to playing is an air guitar in their living room.

1605
02:03:41,608 --> 02:03:44,891
[SPEAKER_02]: and a new video game called Guitar Hero just released today.

1606
02:03:44,911 --> 02:03:46,492
[SPEAKER_02]: In other words, you can't afford this crap.

1607
02:03:47,393 --> 02:03:50,856
[SPEAKER_02]: We're showing this to you because, you know, we're rich and famous.

1608
02:03:51,016 --> 02:03:55,019
[SPEAKER_02]: It's designed to get wannabe rockers closer to the real stage experience.

1609
02:03:55,619 --> 02:03:56,600
[SPEAKER_02]: Brian Hickey rocks on.

1610
02:03:56,640 --> 02:03:58,702
[SPEAKER_02]: He asked the producers of the demo Guitar Hero.

1611
02:03:59,505 --> 02:03:59,685
[SPEAKER_02]: Rock-On

1612
02:04:29,805 --> 02:04:30,986
[SPEAKER_32]: The box office is sold out.

1613
02:04:55,296 --> 02:05:00,219
[SPEAKER_28]: Your guitar is tuned, and you're about to play one of the greatest rock songs ever.

1614
02:05:17,711 --> 02:05:21,935
[SPEAKER_31]: Just because I took time off in your work to come play this stupid game.

1615
02:05:23,216 --> 02:05:23,997
[SPEAKER_31]: I thought you liked the game.

1616
02:05:24,718 --> 02:05:25,919
[SPEAKER_32]: You give it a good score later.

1617
02:05:26,319 --> 02:05:28,361
[SPEAKER_31]: Oh yeah, I give it a good score, but you know what?

1618
02:05:28,381 --> 02:05:33,886
[SPEAKER_31]: I had to drive like a freaking half an hour during my lunch break to come play this game.

1619
02:05:35,408 --> 02:05:35,828
[SPEAKER_31]: Whatever.

1620
02:05:39,772 --> 02:05:42,835
[SPEAKER_28]: That's the idea behind Red Octane's new Guitar Hero.

1621
02:05:44,184 --> 02:05:50,766
[SPEAKER_28]: What we say is rock music inspired this game, so having full-length songs is really important.

1622
02:05:50,986 --> 02:05:56,108
[SPEAKER_28]: Game producer Jon Tam shows Jamie Devrend and Matt Whiteman, two avid gamers, how to play.

1623
02:05:56,948 --> 02:05:59,709
[SPEAKER_28]: I didn't know how to play this before you showed me, dumbass.

1624
02:06:00,169 --> 02:06:01,549
[SPEAKER_28]: I know, I know.

1625
02:06:01,689 --> 02:06:03,170
[SPEAKER_28]: Strings, no chords to learn.

1626
02:06:03,550 --> 02:06:10,172
[SPEAKER_28]: To create music, John presses colored fret buttons to match those on the screen while hitting the strum bar once for each note.

1627
02:06:10,512 --> 02:06:11,012
[SPEAKER_28]: The goal?

1628
02:06:11,452 --> 02:06:14,253
[SPEAKER_28]: Nail as many notes as you can to rack up the high score.

1629
02:06:14,293 --> 02:06:15,313
[SPEAKER_32]: See, now that guy thought ahead.

1630
02:06:15,353 --> 02:06:17,293
[SPEAKER_32]: He's wearing his Guitar Hero shirt on.

1631
02:06:17,734 --> 02:06:18,874
[SPEAKER_32]: So, yeah, you're right.

1632
02:06:18,894 --> 02:06:21,775
[SPEAKER_32]: We need to get Orange Lounge shirts for all these reasons, for all the media whoredom.

1633
02:06:22,315 --> 02:06:24,335
[SPEAKER_32]: If I don't play anything, the guitar track doesn't play.

1634
02:06:24,355 --> 02:06:30,317
[SPEAKER_32]: And if I hit this thing... Go figure that that would happen, that when you don't play anything, the guitar track won't play.

1635
02:06:30,357 --> 02:06:31,217
[SPEAKER_32]: Go fig... I'm just...

1636
02:06:31,604 --> 02:06:33,165
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm just giving this poor guy a hard time.

1637
02:06:33,205 --> 02:06:37,927
[SPEAKER_31]: If you fuck up a lot, then you start doing the jig and then you walk off stage.

1638
02:06:38,827 --> 02:06:40,288
[SPEAKER_31]: Look at these trashy noises.

1639
02:06:40,748 --> 02:06:44,309
[SPEAKER_28]: Each guitar guru character has its own extroverted personality.

1640
02:06:44,489 --> 02:06:49,652
[SPEAKER_28]: There's Pandora, Princess of Rock, and punk virtuoso Johnny Napalm, among others.

1641
02:06:49,992 --> 02:06:52,313
[SPEAKER_35]: I love the remote, so I played I Wanna Be Sedated.

1642
02:06:54,022 --> 02:06:55,502
[SPEAKER_32]: And I'm looking bored in the background.

1643
02:06:55,562 --> 02:06:57,523
[SPEAKER_32]: Then she discovers the whammy bar.

1644
02:07:23,416 --> 02:07:24,577
[SPEAKER_28]: The Whammy Bar, Whammy Bar!

1645
02:07:25,978 --> 02:07:27,879
[SPEAKER_28]: And then she discovered my Whammy Bar.

1646
02:07:30,320 --> 02:07:32,001
[SPEAKER_31]: I hate... The Whammy Bar is my favorite part.

1647
02:07:32,282 --> 02:07:35,624
[SPEAKER_31]: I don't know why the hell I decided to be in these stupid news interviews.

1648
02:07:36,224 --> 02:07:37,105
[SPEAKER_31]: They're really bad.

1649
02:07:37,685 --> 02:07:42,888
[SPEAKER_32]: No, they're only bad when I bring them on the radio and start, you know, making fun of them.

1650
02:07:42,948 --> 02:07:43,529
[SPEAKER_31]: It's embarrassing.

1651
02:07:43,569 --> 02:07:45,130
[SPEAKER_32]: I tease because I love.

1652
02:07:45,850 --> 02:07:47,311
[SPEAKER_32]: I tease because I love to make fun of you.

1653
02:07:47,331 --> 02:07:48,312
[SPEAKER_32]: It does nothing for our station.

1654
02:07:50,928 --> 02:07:54,490
[SPEAKER_34]: It's like gymnastics, you have to land that last note.

1655
02:07:54,590 --> 02:07:58,651
[SPEAKER_32]: I love how Jamie's taking the guitar off as this guy's talking, like, get this fucking thing out of here.

1656
02:07:58,711 --> 02:08:00,032
[SPEAKER_28]: No, I'm kidding.

1657
02:08:00,072 --> 02:08:00,372
[SPEAKER_28]: Be gone.

1658
02:08:00,752 --> 02:08:01,352
[SPEAKER_32]: This is funny.

1659
02:08:01,912 --> 02:08:08,955
[SPEAKER_28]: To give you the experience of being on stage, this film takes you inside the different venues, from practice rooms and basements to sold-out stadiums.

1660
02:08:09,215 --> 02:08:14,217
[SPEAKER_28]: And the fans react, jumping up and down when you rock the house or letting you know if you're playing stinks.

1661
02:08:14,737 --> 02:08:17,218
[SPEAKER_32]: Extifer, wasn't this the same reporter you thought was cute?

1662
02:08:19,258 --> 02:08:21,239
[SPEAKER_34]: Yeah, I still think he's cute.

1663
02:08:21,339 --> 02:08:22,960
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright, slide that up.

1664
02:08:23,180 --> 02:08:33,064
[SPEAKER_34]: You don't play well, they don't like you, they'll start leaving the venue and start booing you, and then eventually if you die, your whole band gives up and throws their hands up in frustration against you.

1665
02:08:35,505 --> 02:08:43,669
[SPEAKER_32]: See, I don't understand that, because, you know, in the real world, Bailing keeps lasting on But Can They Sing, and yet... Never mind, nobody's gonna understand that joke.

1666
02:08:46,084 --> 02:08:50,026
[SPEAKER_28]: Matt likes the fact that Guitar Hero offers different rock genres to explore.

1667
02:08:50,126 --> 02:08:51,767
[SPEAKER_32]: By the way, that's my DDR pad in the background.

1668
02:08:52,068 --> 02:08:53,848
[SPEAKER_32]: That's my cameo in the story.

1669
02:08:54,629 --> 02:08:57,710
[SPEAKER_32]: That's my dance pad lying there unloved in the background.

1670
02:08:59,151 --> 02:09:01,553
[SPEAKER_32]: I don't even know why my dance pad's there.

1671
02:09:01,733 --> 02:09:03,333
[SPEAKER_32]: Red Octane?

1672
02:09:03,494 --> 02:09:05,174
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh yeah, it's the old Red Octane pad though.

1673
02:09:05,254 --> 02:09:08,856
[SPEAKER_28]: From classic rock and hard rock to modern, punk even blues.

1674
02:09:09,477 --> 02:09:09,957
[SPEAKER_28]: Fun game.

1675
02:09:10,515 --> 02:09:11,195
[SPEAKER_28]: Really fun game.

1676
02:09:11,516 --> 02:09:18,559
[SPEAKER_28]: To kick his song into high gear, Matt tilts the guitar up, activating star power, which allows him to rack up even more points.

1677
02:09:19,099 --> 02:09:20,040
[SPEAKER_31]: Really good party game.

1678
02:09:20,120 --> 02:09:24,822
[SPEAKER_31]: I mean, especially, you know, get a bunch of friends together, just, you know, don't say it, smash up some music.

1679
02:09:24,842 --> 02:09:26,002
[SPEAKER_31]: Don't say it, don't say it.

1680
02:09:26,082 --> 02:09:26,543
[SPEAKER_31]: Really fun.

1681
02:09:26,903 --> 02:09:29,444
[SPEAKER_31]: So how do these two gamers rate Guitar Hero?

1682
02:09:29,744 --> 02:09:31,565
[SPEAKER_31]: I'd definitely say it's at least an 8 out of a 10.

1683
02:09:32,185 --> 02:09:32,666
[SPEAKER_32]: And Jamie?

1684
02:09:32,786 --> 02:09:36,968
[SPEAKER_32]: Now see, I could clip that and use that for some great... I'd definitely say it's at least an 8 out of 10.

1685
02:09:38,868 --> 02:09:41,731
[SPEAKER_32]: So, Loki, how big is Skye's penis?

1686
02:09:42,091 --> 02:09:44,133
[SPEAKER_32]: I'd definitely say it's at least an 8 out of 10.

1687
02:09:47,075 --> 02:09:48,517
[SPEAKER_32]: There's so much I could do with this.

1688
02:09:49,978 --> 02:09:50,618
[SPEAKER_35]: Oh, 11.

1689
02:09:52,360 --> 02:09:55,763
[SPEAKER_32]: What's with Jamie and the 11s lately?

1690
02:09:55,943 --> 02:09:57,424
[SPEAKER_31]: They said a scale of 1 to 10.

1691
02:09:57,685 --> 02:10:01,328
[SPEAKER_31]: I was basically giving a ranking within the criteria that they asked.

1692
02:10:01,608 --> 02:10:03,510
[SPEAKER_31]: And she had to go out of the criteria.

1693
02:10:03,530 --> 02:10:04,170
[SPEAKER_31]: I don't know.

1694
02:10:04,351 --> 02:10:05,572
[SPEAKER_31]: It was an 11 game for me.

1695
02:10:05,652 --> 02:10:05,952
[SPEAKER_31]: Whatever.

1696
02:10:06,829 --> 02:10:07,449
[SPEAKER_35]: I like the game.

1697
02:10:07,469 --> 02:10:07,849
[SPEAKER_35]: I like the game.

1698
02:10:07,909 --> 02:10:08,349
[SPEAKER_35]: It's cool.

1699
02:10:08,369 --> 02:10:10,050
[SPEAKER_35]: It's just completely rocking out.

1700
02:10:10,590 --> 02:10:12,751
[SPEAKER_35]: It feels like playing an actual guitar.

1701
02:10:13,491 --> 02:10:16,311
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, they let her talk and they paraphrase me.

1702
02:10:18,432 --> 02:10:20,552
[SPEAKER_28]: Brian Hickey, WB58 News at 10.

1703
02:10:22,613 --> 02:10:26,414
[SPEAKER_32]: Well, maybe what she's saying is more intelligent as opposed to, it's so fun.

1704
02:10:27,794 --> 02:10:31,315
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh, man, I just got the death stare.

1705
02:10:31,535 --> 02:10:33,316
[SPEAKER_32]: This, by the way, will be the last episode on this video.

1706
02:10:36,441 --> 02:10:39,784
[SPEAKER_32]: Anyway, let's see what the two goons on the TV have to say about this.

1707
02:10:40,125 --> 02:10:41,486
[SPEAKER_26]: You've got to love playing that air guitar.

1708
02:10:41,506 --> 02:10:43,188
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to have that mohawk going on.

1709
02:10:43,588 --> 02:10:45,430
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Guitar Hero is designed to be played on PlayStation.

1710
02:10:45,450 --> 02:10:46,951
[SPEAKER_32]: By the way, he was talking about his pubic hair right there.

1711
02:10:46,971 --> 02:10:48,192
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to have that mohawk going on.

1712
02:10:48,472 --> 02:10:49,453
[SPEAKER_02]: Two, and it cost about $70.

1713
02:10:49,533 --> 02:10:50,734
[SPEAKER_02]: Stay with us.

1714
02:10:50,775 --> 02:10:51,856
[SPEAKER_02]: More to come right after the break.

1715
02:10:55,219 --> 02:11:02,045
[SPEAKER_31]: They did also, I want to add, they also did a story apparently about In The Groove and how people are losing weight on it.

1716
02:11:04,249 --> 02:11:07,066
[SPEAKER_31]: To which I could basically go, so you're recycling news now?

1717
02:11:10,722 --> 02:11:12,262
[SPEAKER_32]: I didn't see the In The Groove story.

1718
02:11:12,282 --> 02:11:13,803
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah, we weren't part of it, thank God.

1719
02:11:13,963 --> 02:11:15,663
[SPEAKER_32]: So I didn't bother to tape it.

1720
02:11:15,743 --> 02:11:17,423
[SPEAKER_31]: I would have laughed if they wanted me to play this game.

1721
02:11:17,663 --> 02:11:18,764
[SPEAKER_31]: So what do you give In The Groove?

1722
02:11:18,884 --> 02:11:28,465
[SPEAKER_32]: Well, in the original email, I thought that that was, because that's why I hyped it up like I did, is that you're never going to believe what Loki and DarkSakura are going to be doing on the news.

1723
02:11:28,746 --> 02:11:33,866
[SPEAKER_32]: Because originally it was supposed to be for In The Groove and Guitar Hero, but I guess something got fixed.

1724
02:11:33,907 --> 02:11:35,827
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah, I would have been cut off TV for that.

1725
02:11:35,967 --> 02:11:36,127
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah.

1726
02:11:37,034 --> 02:11:38,556
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright, anyway, we're going to go to another break.

1727
02:11:38,896 --> 02:11:43,460
[SPEAKER_32]: One more break here of Ultramix 3 Music, and then we're going to come back and we're going to reveal the winner of tonight's cage match.

1728
02:11:44,161 --> 02:11:48,506
[SPEAKER_32]: We will also get into the FUs of the week and do Extover's movie review.

1729
02:11:48,566 --> 02:11:49,226
[SPEAKER_32]: We can't forget that.

1730
02:11:49,647 --> 02:11:58,796
[SPEAKER_32]: So don't send your FUs just yet, though, because I haven't tallied cage match votes, but this is the last opportunity for you guys to get your stuff into the cage match and everything you want to vote for there.

1731
02:11:59,216 --> 02:12:05,963
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright, we're going to go into this break, and in this break I think we're going to start it off with a brand new Naoki track from DDR Ultramix 3.

1732
02:12:06,304 --> 02:12:08,666
[SPEAKER_32]: This is Naoki with Brilliant Red.

1733
02:12:11,269 --> 02:12:11,590
Naoki

1734
02:12:45,752 --> 02:12:54,461
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, that you were so much more It's just the way that you move your body with mine Seems like we had no concept

1735
02:13:15,010 --> 02:13:16,251
Thank you for watching!

1736
02:14:08,777 --> 02:14:10,778
[SPEAKER_21]: Watch away what I know, it's an overrated

1737
02:14:43,966 --> 02:14:45,048
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you for watching!

1738
02:14:48,740 --> 02:15:14,221
[SPEAKER_21]: When you speak, when you shout, when you shout out, when you knock myself out, brainwashed I need a brainwash, cream that'll pass, I need to clutter off, thrown in the trash I need a brainwash, cause I'm a moon, cause I'm a psycho, devil's race I'm really gonna miss a maniac, I'm gonna find a way to put me in a room But there's a nickel pin that gives me 14, cause all I wanna do is sing to a national song But I like to sing in minor technology

1739
02:15:16,078 --> 02:15:16,719
Thanks for watching!

1740
02:15:41,269 --> 02:15:48,232
[SPEAKER_21]: And now I fell in love with you so many times, so many times

1741
02:16:11,653 --> 02:16:13,758

02:18:28,130 --> 02:18:29,581
[SPEAKER_17]: Your direction

1744
02:18:50,166 --> 02:18:53,329
[SPEAKER_32]: After this song, we'll be having a Let Them Move Marathon.

1745
02:18:53,649 --> 02:18:55,711
[SPEAKER_21]: No!

1746
02:18:55,911 --> 02:18:56,552
[SPEAKER_32]: Just kidding.

[SPEAKER_32]: Crap-free Bobani Radio.

1749
02:19:00,015 --> 02:19:01,937
[SPEAKER_32]: Welcome back, boys and girls, to Orange Lounge Radio.

1750
02:19:02,818 --> 02:19:06,281
[SPEAKER_32]: I bet you kids are just dying to know who won tonight's cage match, aren't ya?

1751
02:19:06,681 --> 02:19:07,762
[SPEAKER_32]: You're just dying to know.

1752
02:19:07,782 --> 02:19:09,204
[SPEAKER_32]: You just want to know so badly.

1753
02:19:09,584 --> 02:19:10,044
[SPEAKER_32]: Here it is.

1754
02:19:10,225 --> 02:19:12,587
[SPEAKER_32]: The wiener of tonight's cage match tonight is...

1755
02:19:14,369 --> 02:19:17,412
[SPEAKER_32]: John Sykes with Cautionary Warning.

1756
02:19:18,894 --> 02:19:23,599
[SPEAKER_32]: Shoot, all of you.

1757
02:19:23,659 --> 02:19:24,199
[SPEAKER_32]: Rock on.

1758
02:19:24,640 --> 02:19:26,862
[SPEAKER_32]: By the way, check the LiveJournal community.

1759
02:19:27,523 --> 02:19:35,751
[SPEAKER_32]: Dude, it took Socarina like five minutes to turn that into, just like I imagined, into a little picture with the guy doing the rock on song.

1760
02:19:36,229 --> 02:19:38,770
[SPEAKER_27]: We could send a picture of us doing the rock on symbol from that.

1761
02:19:39,071 --> 02:19:42,332
[SPEAKER_32]: We could send it to him, and he'd be all, he'd be all, what the fuck is this?

1762
02:19:42,352 --> 02:19:44,273
[SPEAKER_32]: Because he wouldn't remember doing that, I mean.

1763
02:19:45,474 --> 02:19:48,155
[SPEAKER_32]: It's your fan club, Mr. News Person.

1764
02:19:50,697 --> 02:19:51,317
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh, shit.

1765
02:19:51,377 --> 02:19:51,697
[SPEAKER_32]: All right.

1766
02:19:54,559 --> 02:20:04,064
[SPEAKER_32]: All right, we're going to get into the FUs of the week, and first, in order for us to get into the FUs of the week, I have to have the music queued up, because that's an important part of having the FUs of the week.

1767
02:20:05,385 --> 02:20:05,765
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh, you have a new...

1768
02:20:06,505 --> 02:20:07,145
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh, that's right.

1769
02:20:08,166 --> 02:20:09,326
[SPEAKER_32]: Loki has a new song finally.

1770
02:20:09,647 --> 02:20:11,027
[SPEAKER_32]: You're getting rid of Monomena?

1771
02:20:15,729 --> 02:20:16,810
[SPEAKER_32]: That makes me kind of sad.

1772
02:20:17,230 --> 02:20:21,752
[SPEAKER_32]: That's right, I'll let Mel and Melody have Monomena then, since you're not going to be using it.

1773
02:20:22,233 --> 02:20:26,154
[SPEAKER_32]: You were showing me your video iPod, which I'm so jealous that you have all the latest toys, but would you do this?

1774
02:20:27,335 --> 02:20:31,037
[SPEAKER_27]: So I go and get a video iPod, and I'm like, oh my god, I have the new toy, I love this thing.

1775
02:20:31,077 --> 02:20:32,838
[SPEAKER_27]: So what's the first freaking video I put on it?

1776
02:20:32,938 --> 02:20:33,338
[SPEAKER_27]: Monomena.

1777
02:20:40,291 --> 02:20:43,736
[SPEAKER_32]: Let's get into the FUs of the week, and DarkSakura is usually the one that starts us off.

1778
02:20:43,776 --> 02:20:46,521
[SPEAKER_32]: However, I will be entering FUs on DarkSakura's behalf tonight.

1779
02:20:46,581 --> 02:20:48,284
[SPEAKER_32]: So here we go in the FUs of the week.

1780
02:20:59,172 --> 02:21:01,634
[SPEAKER_32]: DarkSakura, I'll be entering some FUs on DarkSakura's behalf.

1781
02:21:03,055 --> 02:21:10,700
[SPEAKER_32]: First FU is to being sick, because I know she's been sick for like two weeks straight now, and also to bronchitis, which she has, which sucks.

1782
02:21:11,241 --> 02:21:15,163
[SPEAKER_32]: And FU to pneumonia for scaring her, you know, thinking that she might have had pneumonia.

1783
02:21:15,744 --> 02:21:23,089
[SPEAKER_32]: And I think she's very angsty that she didn't get out to do a lot of stuff this weekend that she wanted to do, so I'm sure she's very pissed off about that.

1784
02:21:23,129 --> 02:21:25,570
[SPEAKER_32]: So an FU to being homebound, I guess we could call it.

1785
02:21:26,071 --> 02:21:27,712
[SPEAKER_32]: And an FU to having to go to work tomorrow.

1786
02:21:29,813 --> 02:21:36,095
[SPEAKER_32]: And I think that would about wrap up everything that DarkSakura would be ATS, at least as far as I know, for now.

1787
02:21:36,155 --> 02:21:38,376
[SPEAKER_32]: Let's go into Loki's FUs.

1788
02:21:39,157 --> 02:21:39,317
Okay.

1789
02:21:49,366 --> 02:21:55,487
[SPEAKER_31]: First off, fuck you to Chevron Oil Stop for breaking my car.

1790
02:21:56,347 --> 02:22:00,688
[SPEAKER_31]: Now my car is leaking coolant out, and I'm sure it's not supposed to be doing that.

1791
02:22:01,148 --> 02:22:05,049
[SPEAKER_31]: Because I pour the coolant in, and it pours right out the bottom, so that's not very good.

1792
02:22:05,389 --> 02:22:10,911
[SPEAKER_31]: However, it doesn't empty, so it just overheats, and I've got to take it to the dealership tomorrow, which requires me to take time off work.

1793
02:22:11,731 --> 02:22:13,171
[SPEAKER_31]: It's just a pain in the ass.

1794
02:22:13,786 --> 02:22:41,745
[SPEAKER_31]: so fuck that, and fuck you old Asian women drivers, because god damn it, you fucking suck, I'm sitting in the car watching you drive, and you suck so bad, you know, braking when there's like a car 50 feet in front of you, and like having your turn signal on, and switching lanes the wrong direction, and it's just a pain in the ass, and you just really, you know, are reinforcing the stereotypes, so fuck old Asian women drivers, and finally Rocko,

1795
02:22:43,737 --> 02:22:44,197
[SPEAKER_32]: My turn.

1796
02:22:49,178 --> 02:22:57,120
[SPEAKER_32]: I would like to give an F you to me being a workaholic recently and me being very lazy on the weekend and not having any time to correct the test because I'm too lazy.

1797
02:22:57,820 --> 02:23:09,902
[SPEAKER_32]: An F you to the fact that it took me like an hour to get that set up earlier tonight to rip the Ultramix 3 songs directly from the Xbox and no one appreciates it because the song list is kind of whack.

1798
02:23:11,629 --> 02:23:19,278
[SPEAKER_32]: and I just give, I don't know, an F you to the fact that I have to go back to work tomorrow but at least it's a short week and Thanksgiving's coming.

1799
02:23:19,658 --> 02:23:21,961
[SPEAKER_32]: F you to Thanksgiving because it's a holiday I never really got.

1800
02:23:22,141 --> 02:23:26,266
[SPEAKER_32]: I don't get Thanksgiving but maybe it's just my family because we're special in my family.

1801
02:23:26,286 --> 02:23:27,767
[SPEAKER_32]: We don't really do that.

1802
02:23:27,807 --> 02:23:29,269
[SPEAKER_31]: You should really call it for what it is.

1803
02:23:29,389 --> 02:23:30,591
[SPEAKER_31]: Black Friday Eve.

1804
02:23:32,683 --> 02:23:33,905
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh, for the shopping day, yeah.

1805
02:23:34,385 --> 02:23:34,746
[SPEAKER_32]: Crazy.

1806
02:23:35,347 --> 02:23:38,911
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright, let's go on to Melody.

1807
02:23:38,991 --> 02:23:40,353
[SPEAKER_32]: We're going to do her FUs first.

1808
02:23:40,573 --> 02:23:40,753
Yay!

1809
02:23:40,773 --> 02:23:43,897
[SPEAKER_21]: I like my freaking theme song.

1810
02:23:48,993 --> 02:23:57,920
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, seriously, at work, there's this chick who knows the song and loves my video iPod as much as I do, and we'll yell across the office to each other, and the other one will reply.

1811
02:23:57,960 --> 02:23:58,320
[SPEAKER_27]: It's great.

1812
02:23:58,700 --> 02:24:09,369
[SPEAKER_27]: Anyway, F you to curbs, because they really hurt when you fall on them, and F you to my knee for hurting when I hit the curb.

1813
02:24:10,890 --> 02:24:14,052
[SPEAKER_27]: F you to my shoes, which went out sooner than they were supposed to.

1814
02:24:14,072 --> 02:24:16,574
[SPEAKER_27]: Dude, my shoes are supposed to last like 300 to 500 miles.

1815
02:24:16,614 --> 02:24:17,174
[SPEAKER_27]: They only lasted 200.

1816
02:24:18,266 --> 02:24:39,996
[SPEAKER_27]: which all my FUs seem to be walk related at the moment because that would be my life but um yeah oh FU to Sunday Drivers they had to encounter a lot of them today coming up here and they suck so other than that I'm pretty mellow right now so yeah I'm pretty simple all right Mr. Mel B

1817
02:24:43,030 --> 02:24:51,575
[SPEAKER_38]: Oh gosh, um, I guess my first FU is to all the video game stores and Best Buys in my area, because Guitar Hero is sold out everywhere.

1818
02:24:51,855 --> 02:24:56,757
[SPEAKER_38]: What really sucks is that the one Best Buy by my crib, I was asking the sales associate, you know, do you have this in stock?

1819
02:24:57,258 --> 02:24:58,478
[SPEAKER_38]: And he goes, oh, we don't have it right now.

1820
02:24:58,498 --> 02:25:00,079
[SPEAKER_38]: I'm like, can you check anyone's nearby?

1821
02:25:00,099 --> 02:25:00,980
[SPEAKER_38]: He's like, okay.

1822
02:25:01,400 --> 02:25:05,582
[SPEAKER_38]: And then there's like one that pops up over in South San Jose, it says like two on his screen.

1823
02:25:05,896 --> 02:25:07,177
[SPEAKER_38]: He goes, uh, we're sold out ever.

1824
02:25:07,197 --> 02:25:08,958
[SPEAKER_38]: I'm like, what about that San Jose over there?

1825
02:25:09,178 --> 02:25:10,379
[SPEAKER_38]: Uh, two means we're sold out.

1826
02:25:10,979 --> 02:25:12,280
[SPEAKER_38]: Like, then why is there a two?

1827
02:25:13,201 --> 02:25:16,423
[SPEAKER_38]: Um, you can go there, I guess, but no, trust me, it's sold out.

1828
02:25:16,763 --> 02:25:19,925
[SPEAKER_38]: I'm like, dude, I guess you don't like helping people or making a sale.

1829
02:25:20,626 --> 02:25:24,348
[SPEAKER_38]: Uh, whatever the hell, you know, I hope you're just happy with the minimum wage or something.

1830
02:25:24,889 --> 02:25:32,213
[SPEAKER_38]: But, um, other than that, um, I guess just Defeat and I have enough time to do so much stuff over the weekend, and, uh...

1831
02:25:33,594 --> 02:25:37,159
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah, FU for not having enough FUs to be entertaining.

1832
02:25:37,559 --> 02:25:37,899
[SPEAKER_38]: Alright.

1833
02:25:38,660 --> 02:25:40,282
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright, Angel, your FUs of the week.

1834
02:25:41,063 --> 02:25:45,709
[SPEAKER_25]: I actually don't have any, but... Nothing?

1835
02:25:46,948 --> 02:25:48,329
[SPEAKER_25]: Aw, no more ball pits!

1836
02:25:49,310 --> 02:25:51,411
[SPEAKER_32]: Pair drop!

1837
02:25:51,772 --> 02:25:53,193
[SPEAKER_25]: It's okay.

1838
02:25:54,513 --> 02:25:59,797
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, I guess I could say a general F you, but then... Out with it!

1839
02:25:59,997 --> 02:26:00,357
[SPEAKER_09]: Out with it!

1840
02:26:00,838 --> 02:26:02,119
[SPEAKER_25]: Mel B might look at me funny.

1841
02:26:03,379 --> 02:26:08,423
[SPEAKER_25]: They need more games to help people with visual impairment, isn't it?

1842
02:26:09,824 --> 02:26:11,485
[SPEAKER_25]: So, um, yeah.

1843
02:26:11,665 --> 02:26:15,327
[SPEAKER_25]: Cause, um, if it wasn't for certain World of Warcraft mods, I'd be in big trouble.

1844
02:26:16,028 --> 02:26:16,928
[SPEAKER_25]: So, yeah.

1845
02:26:17,529 --> 02:26:21,592
[SPEAKER_25]: At least World of Warcraft is moddable enough to be able to do something like that.

1846
02:26:22,292 --> 02:26:26,595
[SPEAKER_25]: But, I beat all the other people that don't think about that before they release a game.

1847
02:26:27,936 --> 02:26:28,616
[SPEAKER_32]: Fair enough.

1848
02:26:28,636 --> 02:26:32,719
[SPEAKER_32]: Well, at least the computer has it down pretty good with the accessibility options and everything.

1849
02:26:32,759 --> 02:26:33,039
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes.

1850
02:26:34,160 --> 02:26:35,761
[SPEAKER_25]: This is why I'm a computer geek.

1851
02:26:35,861 --> 02:26:37,002
[SPEAKER_25]: I can see things.

1852
02:26:37,402 --> 02:26:37,802
[SPEAKER_25]: Yay.

1853
02:26:39,321 --> 02:26:47,927
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright, now it's my understanding that DarkSakura was actually at her computer just now, and she wanted to try and call in and get the real FUs, so I'm gonna try and get her on the line here.

1854
02:26:49,348 --> 02:26:54,912
[SPEAKER_32]: Let's make this really quiet here, let's see if we can get DarkSakura's FUs, and then we'll go to the chatroom FUs, of which I know you guys have plenty of FUs.

1855
02:27:00,877 --> 02:27:03,899
[SPEAKER_21]: It's got that demon voice again, ah!

1856
02:27:04,759 --> 02:27:05,380
[SPEAKER_32]: What, you there, Jamie?

1857
02:27:08,410 --> 02:27:08,730
[SPEAKER_32]: Hello?

1858
02:27:09,531 --> 02:27:12,152
[SPEAKER_32]: There we go, yes, now we're good.

1859
02:27:12,772 --> 02:27:14,073
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright, great, yes, I can hear you now.

1860
02:27:14,333 --> 02:27:15,413
[SPEAKER_32]: Are you ready to do your FUs?

1861
02:27:19,075 --> 02:27:24,898
[SPEAKER_32]: That's weird, I only heard her for like five seconds there, something like, what's wrong?

1862
02:27:25,438 --> 02:27:27,599
[SPEAKER_32]: Uh, you're, oh, shoot, did it just hang up?

1863
02:27:29,730 --> 02:27:30,371
[SPEAKER_32]: It hung up!

1864
02:27:30,531 --> 02:27:31,251
[SPEAKER_32]: No, no!

1865
02:27:31,371 --> 02:27:32,532
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay, wait, she's calling us back.

1866
02:27:32,652 --> 02:27:34,454
[SPEAKER_32]: Let me make sure all my other crap is closed.

1867
02:27:34,474 --> 02:27:35,174
[SPEAKER_32]: I have nothing else going on.

1868
02:27:35,214 --> 02:27:35,915
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay, let's try this again.

1869
02:27:36,535 --> 02:27:38,757
[SPEAKER_32]: Let me try closing iTunes, because iTunes is a real memory hog.

1870
02:27:38,817 --> 02:27:39,557
[SPEAKER_32]: That might be part of the problem.

1871
02:27:39,577 --> 02:27:40,058
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright, here we go.

1872
02:27:41,038 --> 02:27:41,419
[SPEAKER_32]: Yes?

1873
02:27:42,800 --> 02:27:43,300
[SPEAKER_11]: Excuse me.

1874
02:27:43,480 --> 02:27:44,661
[SPEAKER_32]: There we go, now you're there.

1875
02:27:45,462 --> 02:27:47,143
[SPEAKER_11]: It's because I disconnected IRC.

1876
02:27:47,263 --> 02:27:49,444
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a delay that IRC is causing.

1877
02:27:50,225 --> 02:27:50,826
[SPEAKER_32]: Interesting.

1878
02:27:50,846 --> 02:27:52,106
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay, well, are you ready to do your FUs?

1879
02:27:52,146 --> 02:27:53,107
[SPEAKER_32]: I have your music already.

1880
02:27:53,808 --> 02:27:54,808
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I'm pretty ready.

1881
02:27:54,909 --> 02:27:55,349
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright, here we go.

1882
02:27:59,631 --> 02:28:01,652
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm turning it down now.

1883
02:28:01,672 --> 02:28:02,032
[SPEAKER_10]: There we go.

1884
02:28:02,593 --> 02:28:03,133
[SPEAKER_11]: There we go.

1885
02:28:04,033 --> 02:28:08,015
[SPEAKER_11]: My first SU goes toward having a pissed off and depressed husband.

1886
02:28:09,916 --> 02:28:15,919
[SPEAKER_11]: My second SU goes to people who are pissed off at everyone who's able to get an Xbox 360 on launch date.

1887
02:28:16,279 --> 02:28:19,801
[SPEAKER_11]: Just because you can't get one, bitch, don't mean you should be down with everybody else.

1888
02:28:20,101 --> 02:28:20,542
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello?

1889
02:28:24,744 --> 02:28:29,026
[SPEAKER_11]: The third one goes toward my pre-pneumonia.

1890
02:28:30,675 --> 02:28:36,400
[SPEAKER_11]: and the fact that my antibiotics are just now starting to make me feel sicker.

1891
02:28:37,721 --> 02:28:41,584
[SPEAKER_11]: And I can't really think of much of anything else.

1892
02:28:41,644 --> 02:28:44,146
[SPEAKER_11]: Those are the major pressing items on my mind.

1893
02:28:45,707 --> 02:28:46,167
[SPEAKER_32]: Alrighty.

1894
02:28:46,327 --> 02:28:48,389
[SPEAKER_32]: Well, I'm glad we could get you back on for the FUs.

1895
02:28:48,469 --> 02:28:52,192
[SPEAKER_32]: After all, it is your baby here on the program, the angst, so...

1896
02:28:53,046 --> 02:28:54,987
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course, it's not FU's about me.

1897
02:28:55,227 --> 02:28:58,308
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright, well, we're gonna let you go for now though, so we can get to chatroom FU's, okay?

1898
02:28:58,829 --> 02:28:59,169
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay!

1899
02:28:59,349 --> 02:28:59,849
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright, take care.

1900
02:29:00,629 --> 02:29:00,870
[SPEAKER_11]: Bye.

1901
02:29:01,050 --> 02:29:01,290
[SPEAKER_32]: Bye.

1902
02:29:02,010 --> 02:29:05,472
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay, uh, let's get into chatroom FU's.

1903
02:29:05,512 --> 02:29:07,233
[SPEAKER_32]: And god damn, there's a lot of you angst.

1904
02:29:07,273 --> 02:29:09,113
[SPEAKER_32]: Look at all, look, every single one of these blinking.

1905
02:29:09,534 --> 02:29:11,555
[SPEAKER_32]: Every single one of those things blinking right now is an FU, so.

1906
02:29:14,016 --> 02:29:14,756
[SPEAKER_32]: Get a cup of cocoa.

1907
02:29:14,776 --> 02:29:16,757
[SPEAKER_32]: This is gonna be like an Ultramix 3 loading screen.

1908
02:29:19,810 --> 02:29:24,694
[SPEAKER_32]: Sakurina says F you to Konami for not having In My Dreams in any games other than Dance Maniac's first mix.

1909
02:29:24,734 --> 02:29:28,998
[SPEAKER_32]: It's the best Dance Maniac song ever and you guys can't even bother putting it in anything but Dance Maniacs?

1910
02:29:29,038 --> 02:29:29,458
[SPEAKER_32]: Fuck you!

1911
02:29:30,119 --> 02:29:34,242
[SPEAKER_32]: Also F you to the stupid teacher who made me fail his class because he made an error and still won't correct it.

1912
02:29:34,703 --> 02:29:38,946
[SPEAKER_32]: F you to the smoker bitch at the bus stop who never stops blowing her goddamn cigarette smoke my way.

1913
02:29:39,286 --> 02:29:42,629
[SPEAKER_32]: And final F you, F you to the Xbox 360 for being an overrated piece of shit.

1914
02:29:42,909 --> 02:29:45,271
[SPEAKER_32]: Thanks Microsoft for making a sucky demo kiosk.

1915
02:29:45,872 --> 02:29:46,733
[SPEAKER_32]: That was from Sakurina.

1916
02:29:47,816 --> 02:29:54,819
[SPEAKER_32]: Dark Knight would like to say, um, F you to having to get up at 5am to catch a bus to get to work now, and F you to being broke again.

1917
02:29:57,900 --> 02:30:04,583
[SPEAKER_32]: Um, NintendoManiac64 says, F you to you guys not noticing that someone was playing Mario Kart DS about an hour ago.

1918
02:30:04,963 --> 02:30:08,724
[SPEAKER_32]: No, I knew Loki's been playing Mario Kart DS all night, but I thought, I didn't think the mic was picking it up.

1919
02:30:09,285 --> 02:30:12,086
[SPEAKER_32]: Uh, F you to you guys for not sharing your MKDS friend codes.

1920
02:30:12,386 --> 02:30:14,747
[SPEAKER_32]: I'll give it out, just send me a private message on Orange Lounge.

1921
02:30:14,807 --> 02:30:17,508
[SPEAKER_32]: I just don't want, like, the freaky other people on the internet to, to

1922
02:30:17,819 --> 02:30:18,439
[SPEAKER_32]: DarkLionXVI says,

1923
02:30:42,441 --> 02:30:46,103
[SPEAKER_32]: F you to Colin Cowherd of ESPN Radio for dissing the late Eddie Guerrero.

1924
02:30:46,163 --> 02:30:46,984
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh, I heard about this.

1925
02:30:47,444 --> 02:30:51,006
[SPEAKER_32]: You might have no interest in professional wrestling, but dissing the dead is unforgivable.

1926
02:30:51,126 --> 02:30:53,287
[SPEAKER_32]: I hope you die and see what it's like to be dissed dead.

1927
02:30:53,988 --> 02:30:54,768
[SPEAKER_32]: You know what?

1928
02:30:54,988 --> 02:31:04,253
[SPEAKER_32]: I don't follow wrestling, so I didn't... But that's why I don't say anything about it, because I don't follow it, so I just, you know... Well, if it's any consolation, I'm 100% behind that F you.

1929
02:31:04,293 --> 02:31:06,835
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah, I understand it's a big deal, you know.

1930
02:31:07,435 --> 02:31:09,156
[SPEAKER_32]: Don't fuck with wrestling fans, man.

1931
02:31:09,176 --> 02:31:09,736
[SPEAKER_32]: There's some...

1932
02:31:10,777 --> 02:31:12,178
[SPEAKER_32]: They will throw you to the mat.

1933
02:31:12,218 --> 02:31:18,482
[SPEAKER_27]: Dude, one of the pro wrestling sites put up the ESPN comment line and email address and the wrestling fans crashed both.

1934
02:31:18,622 --> 02:31:19,763
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh, I can imagine.

1935
02:31:19,783 --> 02:31:24,846
[SPEAKER_32]: Ah, we don't do personal FUs.

1936
02:31:25,366 --> 02:31:27,888
[SPEAKER_32]: FU to some people telling me to stop correcting at things.

1937
02:31:28,669 --> 02:31:32,231
[SPEAKER_32]: Hey, they might be something little to you, but that's a big thing to me.

1938
02:31:34,059 --> 02:31:39,504
[SPEAKER_32]: SSJ100 Matt says, F you to work screwing me over this week and making me miss my first Thanksgiving away from home.

1939
02:31:39,984 --> 02:31:44,288
[SPEAKER_32]: F you to True Crimes New York City for being such a good game but glitchy and choppy as hell.

1940
02:31:47,090 --> 02:31:52,054
[SPEAKER_32]: Popanda says, F you to my gimpy father for preventing me from getting Indian food.

1941
02:31:54,616 --> 02:31:55,277
[SPEAKER_32]: Too spicy?

1942
02:31:56,018 --> 02:31:56,318
[SPEAKER_32]: I don't know.

1943
02:31:57,299 --> 02:32:02,343
[SPEAKER_32]: Illusion says, F you to being sick for two weeks straight and F you to having two, count them, two papers due this week.

02:32:10,374 --> 02:32:13,256
[SPEAKER_32]: I think there was something else, but I forget, so F you to my shit memory.

1946
02:32:14,396 --> 02:32:19,299
[SPEAKER_32]: Neo14789 says, F you to the creative Xbox 360 distribution strategy.

1947
02:32:19,439 --> 02:32:20,020
[SPEAKER_32]: It sucks!

1948
02:32:21,541 --> 02:32:24,623
[SPEAKER_32]: Xander C would like to say, F you to being on the East Coast.

1949
02:32:24,683 --> 02:32:26,644
[SPEAKER_32]: It's too damn late right now, like midnight.

1950
02:32:27,824 --> 02:32:28,905
[SPEAKER_32]: Sorry, that's our bad.

1951
02:32:29,425 --> 02:32:30,406

1957
02:32:45,772 --> 02:32:52,176
[SPEAKER_32]: Legend of Zaku says, F you to MTV for being unprepared assholes who have no gaming taste, but at least they gave me two $50 games.

1958
02:32:52,436 --> 02:32:54,457
[SPEAKER_32]: Thanks MTV for pipping my checking account.

1959
02:32:54,857 --> 02:33:02,001
[SPEAKER_32]: F you to GameStop for having the gall of offering me $14 for my sealed copy of NBA Live 06, and 20% less of that if I wanted cash for it.

1960
02:33:03,140 --> 02:33:06,002
[SPEAKER_32]: Roz would like to say F you to whatever my dad's deal was last night.

[SPEAKER_32]: It's not our fault that the directors were bitches to you.

1963

[SPEAKER_32]: Brilliant Red sucks.

1966
02:33:21,350 --> 02:33:22,211
[SPEAKER_32]: It's not a good song.

1967
02:33:22,251 --> 02:33:25,253
[SPEAKER_32]: Go listen to B-Rock U. I have to agree.

1968
02:33:25,293 --> 02:33:26,033
[SPEAKER_32]: Brilliant Red sucks.

1969
02:33:26,193 --> 02:33:28,995
[SPEAKER_32]: So you have at least my support in that, BXJasonXB.

[SPEAKER_32]: That's like that time Loki and I tried to go to Hooters and there was a very random Audioslave concert in the middle of the street.

1974
02:33:51,648 --> 02:33:53,249
[SPEAKER_32]: How many times does that happen to you?

1975
02:33:53,329 --> 02:33:57,571
[SPEAKER_32]: That you have this just a random, oh hey look, Audioslave's doing a concert in the middle of the street.

1976
02:33:58,075 --> 02:34:01,778

1977
02:34:01,798 --> 02:34:03,519
[SPEAKER_27]: That's how they did their All Because of You video.

1978
02:34:04,039 --> 02:34:07,701
[SPEAKER_27]: And you see a bunch of people taking pictures with their cell phones and stuff.

1979
02:34:07,721 --> 02:34:08,942
[SPEAKER_27]: They're all like, what the hell is U2?

[SPEAKER_32]: All right.

1981

[SPEAKER_32]: Melody?

1995
02:34:28,347 --> 02:34:29,648
[SPEAKER_27]: I have to take time to think.

1996
02:34:31,590 --> 02:34:32,510
[SPEAKER_38]: Well, gosh, man.

1997
02:34:32,630 --> 02:34:33,051
[SPEAKER_38]: Ultramix 3.

02:34:33,431 --> 02:34:37,834
[SPEAKER_38]: Well, let's just hope Ultramix 4 about does this last bit.

[SPEAKER_32]: Awesome.

2003
02:34:50,030 --> 02:34:54,372
[SPEAKER_32]: And then I can't say what the other thing is because it's a birthday present for somebody, but thanks for that too, for hooking up.

2004
02:34:54,492 --> 02:35:00,634
[SPEAKER_38]: Okay, and I think, like I said, like I mentioned before, I'll have one for the, maybe for the masses if they're nice.

[SPEAKER_32]: Peace, you cool cats.

02:35:29,427 --> 02:35:34,508
[SPEAKER_32]: We had some requests, so I'm going to get to those requests because I'm a nice guy and I'm doing the requests.

2019
02:35:34,548 --> 02:35:42,451
[SPEAKER_32]: So we're going to do just a couple of requests, then we're going to come back and yes, I will open up the Skype line one more time because some of you guys are bitching and moaning that you didn't get through

2020
02:35:42,779 --> 02:35:44,483
[SPEAKER_32]: So we'll give you one more chance.

2021
02:35:44,924 --> 02:35:46,086
[SPEAKER_32]: So we'll be back after this.

2022
02:35:46,487 --> 02:35:50,415
[SPEAKER_32]: Started off with that Forsaid Dance Maniacs song in some of these FUs.

2023
02:35:50,495 --> 02:35:50,856
[SPEAKER_32]: We'll be back.

2024
02:40:48,409 --> 02:40:59,704
[SPEAKER_06]: For up to the minute Vamanian gaming news, discussion forums, and for access to the chat room, visit our website at orangeloungeradio.com.

2025
02:41:04,156 --> 02:41:10,505
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright kids, so we're back here on Orange Lingerie, and as promised we will be opening the Skype line soon, but we have a couple things we need to get to first.

2026
02:41:11,526 --> 02:41:21,600
[SPEAKER_32]: One of them being the one and only Extifer is here, and Extifer, you do your own show on this station, believe it or not, I don't know why we gave you a show, but you do have one, and when is it?

2027
02:41:22,279 --> 02:41:23,340
[SPEAKER_37]: It's on Mondays.

2028
02:41:23,800 --> 02:41:26,522
[SPEAKER_37]: It's on Mondays at 7 o'clock to 9.

2029
02:41:27,763 --> 02:41:28,883
[SPEAKER_37]: Pretty random show.

2030
02:41:29,243 --> 02:41:36,268
[SPEAKER_37]: We don't talk about video games all too much, but I pretty much open the show to talk about anything.

2031
02:41:37,088 --> 02:41:39,490
[SPEAKER_37]: Mostly cock, ass, and fucking.

2032
02:41:39,710 --> 02:41:41,773
[SPEAKER_32]: So it's like The View, but with a bunch of perverts.

2033
02:41:41,953 --> 02:41:44,557
[SPEAKER_37]: Oh yeah, and I try to have guests on the show.

2034
02:41:45,198 --> 02:41:50,445
[SPEAKER_37]: Last week, by the way, I gave everybody an assignment that nobody has emailed me over.

2035
02:41:50,465 --> 02:41:51,266
[SPEAKER_32]: What is the assignment?

2036
02:41:51,286 --> 02:41:55,753
[SPEAKER_37]: The assignment was to watch a sad movie and email me your thoughts on it.

2037
02:41:56,865 --> 02:41:57,526
[SPEAKER_37]: Oh, and nobody's done it.

2038
02:41:57,546 --> 02:42:00,369
[SPEAKER_37]: I told the whole chat room to do it, and they have not done it.

2039
02:42:00,549 --> 02:42:01,910
[SPEAKER_37]: Well, then you better hurry up.

2040
02:42:02,491 --> 02:42:05,594
[SPEAKER_37]: I'm going to beat all of your asses tomorrow on my show if you guys don't do that.

2041
02:42:06,535 --> 02:42:07,356
[SPEAKER_32]: All right.

2042
02:42:07,416 --> 02:42:09,338
[SPEAKER_32]: Public spanking from Esther.

2043
02:42:09,398 --> 02:42:11,400
[SPEAKER_32]: Tuesday nights on this very station.

2044
02:42:11,720 --> 02:42:13,341
[SPEAKER_32]: She's only every other week for right now.

2045
02:42:13,442 --> 02:42:17,545
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm not sure if she's on or off this week because of her being sick.

2046
02:42:17,606 --> 02:42:19,968
[SPEAKER_32]: I think it's an on week, but because she's sick, she might be off.

2047
02:42:20,688 --> 02:42:24,249
[SPEAKER_32]: I don't know, but check out, pump up the volume with the one and only DarkSakura.

2048
02:42:24,269 --> 02:42:26,510
[SPEAKER_32]: And of course, that's 7 o'clock Pacific Time.

2049
02:42:26,990 --> 02:42:37,234
[SPEAKER_32]: And of course, if you want to always be in the know on when we're live and stuff, the best place to be is our LiveJournal community, www.livejournal.com slash users slash Orange Lounge.

2050
02:42:37,714 --> 02:42:39,055
[SPEAKER_32]: I wonder if you know what it's about.

2051
02:42:39,075 --> 02:42:39,135
[SPEAKER_32]: Hey!

2052
02:43:09,414 --> 02:43:11,216
[SPEAKER_32]: Mr. Wonderful, what are you going to be reviewing today?

2053
02:43:11,997 --> 02:43:13,979
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh, that's right, you're a big Harry Potter whore, aren't you?

2054
02:43:14,199 --> 02:43:15,640
[SPEAKER_32]: I am a big Harry Potter whore.

2055
02:43:15,660 --> 02:43:17,522
[SPEAKER_32]: So were you in line with all the 13-year-old girls?

2056
02:43:17,602 --> 02:43:18,063
[SPEAKER_32]: I wasn't.

2057
02:43:19,636 --> 02:43:26,597
[SPEAKER_37]: I just have to say that I had to work on Friday, so I didn't get to see it until Friday after work, after 5 o'clock.

2058
02:43:28,178 --> 02:43:37,139
[SPEAKER_37]: We had tried to go to an earlier showing, but all the showings were sold out, so we had to go see the last showing, which was at 11.05.

2059
02:43:37,239 --> 02:43:39,480
[SPEAKER_37]: Didn't the movie make like $11 billion this weekend?

2060
02:43:39,760 --> 02:43:45,901
[SPEAKER_37]: You know, it's interesting because their expectations for this film were that it was going to make less,

2061
02:43:46,696 --> 02:43:47,036
[SPEAKER_37]: and so on.

2062
02:44:13,556 --> 02:44:22,384
[SPEAKER_37]: Of the four movies that are the best openings ever, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is the only one that is a winner movie.

2063
02:44:23,225 --> 02:44:31,793
[SPEAKER_37]: All the other ones are summer films, like Spider-Man, and then there was a couple other ones, Return of the Sith or whatever.

2064
02:44:31,934 --> 02:44:33,735
[SPEAKER_37]: Anyways, yeah, I'm not a Star Wars fan.

2065
02:44:33,775 --> 02:44:35,337
[SPEAKER_37]: Anyways, so I...

2066
02:44:36,801 --> 02:44:40,924
[SPEAKER_37]: I saw the movie and it is really good.

2067
02:44:41,104 --> 02:44:41,785
[SPEAKER_37]: I enjoyed it.

2068
02:44:44,126 --> 02:44:49,250
[SPEAKER_37]: It fucking annoyed me at the beginning because, and it was weird because

2069
02:44:50,356 --> 02:44:54,657
[SPEAKER_37]: The third one didn't annoy me at all for what they left out in the book.

2070
02:44:54,757 --> 02:44:55,738
[SPEAKER_37]: I loved the film.

2071
02:44:55,798 --> 02:44:57,938
[SPEAKER_37]: It was great the whole way through.

2072
02:44:58,278 --> 02:44:59,499
[SPEAKER_37]: I saw it seven times.

2073
02:44:59,959 --> 02:45:00,999
[SPEAKER_37]: I saw it in London.

2074
02:45:01,859 --> 02:45:07,221
[SPEAKER_37]: It was something that was kind of like a magical experience for Christopher.

2075
02:45:08,141 --> 02:45:10,742
[SPEAKER_37]: But this one kind of bugged me.

2076
02:45:10,802 --> 02:45:12,462
[SPEAKER_37]: I kept on comparing it to the book.

2077
02:45:12,823 --> 02:45:17,124
[SPEAKER_37]: I think it's because they left out so much and I was wanting to...

2078
02:45:18,044 --> 02:45:19,746
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you for watching, and I'll see you next time!

2079
02:45:29,338 --> 02:45:30,439
[SPEAKER_37]: It's like so good.

2080
02:45:30,599 --> 02:45:32,080
[SPEAKER_37]: It gets really good near the end.

2081
02:45:32,501 --> 02:45:33,922
[SPEAKER_37]: And they do a lot of good stuff.

2082
02:45:34,362 --> 02:45:36,885
[SPEAKER_37]: And it is dark, and it did earn its PG-13 rating.

2083
02:45:37,365 --> 02:45:50,516
[SPEAKER_37]: Whether it was for the gratuitous sexual innuendos or the, you know, dark themes throughout the film, I don't know what it was, you know, why it was rated PG-13.

2084
02:45:50,857 --> 02:45:52,899
[SPEAKER_37]: But it was rated PG-13 for a reason.

2085
02:45:53,658 --> 02:45:54,959
[SPEAKER_37]: And it was really good.

2086
02:45:55,039 --> 02:45:55,860
[SPEAKER_37]: I recommend it.

2087
02:45:55,960 --> 02:46:10,053
[SPEAKER_37]: It's just that they rushed through the first half of the film so much that you're kind of feeling like you're ADD, like you can't focus on one particular scene, you know, because they take so much... It's like they wanted to put as much as they could from the book, but they just couldn't because of time constraints.

2088
02:46:11,794 --> 02:46:12,235
[SPEAKER_37]: It was good.

2089
02:46:12,835 --> 02:46:13,335
[SPEAKER_37]: I enjoyed it.

2090
02:46:13,656 --> 02:46:14,857
[SPEAKER_37]: I enjoyed it mucho.

2091
02:46:14,997 --> 02:46:15,717
[SPEAKER_37]: Recommend it.

2092
02:46:16,958 --> 02:46:17,879
[SPEAKER_37]: So, thumbs up?

2093
02:46:18,440 --> 02:46:19,941
[SPEAKER_37]: Thumbs up.

2094
02:46:20,041 --> 02:46:22,063
[SPEAKER_37]: I didn't love it, but I liked it a lot.

2095
02:46:23,824 --> 02:46:27,407
[SPEAKER_37]: And I can't wait for the next one, because that was my favorite book.

2096
02:46:27,988 --> 02:46:29,068
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright.

2097
02:46:29,088 --> 02:46:31,190
[SPEAKER_32]: We'll see what happens.

2098
02:46:31,230 --> 02:46:33,912
[SPEAKER_32]: Moving on now, what we're going to do is we are...

2099
02:46:36,940 --> 02:46:41,781
[SPEAKER_32]: Gonna go ahead and give DarkSakura another call because she's not able to be here in person tonight.

2100
02:46:43,001 --> 02:46:46,262
[SPEAKER_32]: But she does want to talk to us all through the Skype line and let us know how she's enjoying the show.

2101
02:46:48,062 --> 02:46:49,602
[SPEAKER_32]: And then we'll open the Skype line to the rest of you.

2102
02:46:50,042 --> 02:46:50,862
[SPEAKER_32]: Because I promise we would.

2103
02:46:51,763 --> 02:46:54,363
[SPEAKER_32]: We might have time to squeeze one more call in before the show's over.

2104
02:46:55,843 --> 02:46:56,423
Hello?

2105
02:46:56,623 --> 02:46:57,043
[SPEAKER_32]: Hello!

2106
02:47:07,878 --> 02:47:08,298
[SPEAKER_32]: Jamie?

2107
02:47:11,440 --> 02:47:13,082
[SPEAKER_32]: Well, it didn't have the... She didn't hang up on you?

2108
02:47:13,242 --> 02:47:13,902
[SPEAKER_32]: No, she didn't hang up.

2109
02:47:14,062 --> 02:47:14,503
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh, there we are.

2110
02:47:14,663 --> 02:47:15,043
[SPEAKER_32]: Hello?

2111
02:47:17,205 --> 02:47:17,785
[SPEAKER_32]: Can you hear me?

2112
02:47:18,265 --> 02:47:19,666
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah, we can kind of hear you.

2113
02:47:21,367 --> 02:47:24,970
[SPEAKER_32]: I had to turn off the... That's weird.

2114
02:47:25,210 --> 02:47:26,971
[SPEAKER_32]: Call us right back.

2115
02:47:27,091 --> 02:47:27,692
[SPEAKER_32]: I hope she heard that.

2116
02:47:27,732 --> 02:47:28,612
[SPEAKER_32]: Call us right back.

2117
02:47:29,213 --> 02:47:30,073
[SPEAKER_32]: I hope she got that part.

2118
02:47:30,614 --> 02:47:32,435
[SPEAKER_32]: Because it seems like it works better when she calls us.

2119
02:47:32,715 --> 02:47:33,616
[SPEAKER_32]: I don't know if it's just me.

2120
02:47:33,656 --> 02:47:36,418
[SPEAKER_37]: It's like she's not Dark Sakura, she's Dark Sock.

2121
02:47:38,066 --> 02:47:38,466
[SPEAKER_37]: Hello!

2122
02:47:41,047 --> 02:47:41,727
[SPEAKER_32]: Coffee cough.

2123
02:47:41,747 --> 02:47:43,127
[SPEAKER_32]: Well, at least we know we can hear her this time.

2124
02:47:43,167 --> 02:47:44,267
[SPEAKER_32]: I know, doesn't she sound so sick?

2125
02:47:44,447 --> 02:47:45,328
[SPEAKER_32]: How are you, Jamie?

2126
02:47:46,508 --> 02:47:47,008
Nah!

2127
02:47:47,908 --> 02:47:48,929
[SPEAKER_32]: Are you enjoying the show?

2128
02:47:50,009 --> 02:47:50,609
[SPEAKER_11]: Sort of.

2129
02:47:50,829 --> 02:47:52,189
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah?

2130
02:47:52,309 --> 02:47:56,050
[SPEAKER_11]: It's better when I'm there, because it's, you know... I know.

2131
02:47:56,110 --> 02:47:59,471
[SPEAKER_32]: Mel and Melody say hello, of course, and, you know, hope you feel better and stuff.

2132
02:48:01,030 --> 02:48:02,830
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I'm not running a fever anymore.

2133
02:48:03,350 --> 02:48:04,011
[SPEAKER_32]: That's good.

2134
02:48:04,911 --> 02:48:05,891
[SPEAKER_32]: They brought you a present.

2135
02:48:06,871 --> 02:48:06,991
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh?

2136
02:48:07,251 --> 02:48:11,272
[SPEAKER_32]: I can't say what it is because it's something I got someone else for their birthday who might be listening.

2137
02:48:11,432 --> 02:48:13,713
[SPEAKER_32]: So, it's something.

2138
02:48:13,893 --> 02:48:14,993
[SPEAKER_32]: I'll send you a private message.

2139
02:48:15,893 --> 02:48:16,393
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

2140
02:48:16,573 --> 02:48:16,833
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay.

2141
02:48:18,374 --> 02:48:20,474
[SPEAKER_11]: We've got ten minutes left on the show.

2142
02:48:20,774 --> 02:48:21,074
[SPEAKER_32]: I know.

2143
02:48:21,534 --> 02:48:22,454
[SPEAKER_32]: Aw, sweetie, feel better.

2144
02:48:23,695 --> 02:48:26,395
[SPEAKER_32]: Well, is there anything else you wanted to say to the listeners?

2145
02:48:26,455 --> 02:48:28,056
[SPEAKER_32]: Give them a final thought of some sort?

2146
02:48:29,876 --> 02:48:29,976
[SPEAKER_11]: Um...

2147
02:48:31,520 --> 02:48:32,540
[SPEAKER_11]: I like burritos.

2148
02:48:32,940 --> 02:48:33,841
[SPEAKER_11]: I ate one today.

2149
02:48:34,501 --> 02:48:35,681
[SPEAKER_32]: Congratulations.

2150
02:48:36,442 --> 02:48:37,982
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't like lung cookies.

2151
02:48:38,462 --> 02:48:40,403
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel like my cat.

2152
02:48:40,643 --> 02:48:42,163
[SPEAKER_32]: Don't burritos make you fart, though?

2153
02:48:43,304 --> 02:48:44,584
[SPEAKER_11]: No, they make me throw up.

2154
02:48:44,684 --> 02:48:46,124
[SPEAKER_32]: That's the problem I have with burritos.

2155
02:48:46,205 --> 02:48:47,705
[SPEAKER_32]: They make me fart like a whole bunch.

2156
02:48:47,865 --> 02:48:49,125
[SPEAKER_32]: That is new information.

2157
02:48:49,145 --> 02:48:49,546
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you for that.

2158
02:48:49,566 --> 02:48:51,086
[SPEAKER_11]: I know what my cat feels like, though.

2159
02:48:52,466 --> 02:48:53,607
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh, go ahead.

2160
02:48:53,627 --> 02:48:56,548
[SPEAKER_11]: Because horking up lung cookies is like horking up air balls.

2161
02:48:58,647 --> 02:48:59,387
[SPEAKER_32]: I saw Adam Curry's hair.

2162
02:48:59,407 --> 02:49:00,368
[SPEAKER_32]: He was stood a foot away from me.

2163
02:49:00,388 --> 02:49:00,948
[SPEAKER_32]: He's still hot.

2164
02:49:27,887 --> 02:49:30,869
[SPEAKER_11]: And he's like put on muscle or something.

2165
02:49:30,929 --> 02:49:32,510
[SPEAKER_11]: He looks like really good shape.

2166
02:49:32,690 --> 02:49:33,590
[SPEAKER_32]: Maybe he's been working out.

2167
02:49:34,270 --> 02:49:34,711
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe.

2168
02:49:35,311 --> 02:49:42,955
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think now that he's a little older, he actually looks more handsome than he did back in his, you know, glam-looking 80s days.

2169
02:49:45,396 --> 02:49:46,437
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you get to get up on stage?

2170
02:49:48,898 --> 02:49:52,160
[SPEAKER_11]: No, they didn't let us say anything, so Julie and I just leeched off the buffet.

2171
02:49:53,080 --> 02:49:54,001
[SPEAKER_32]: Hey, awesome food!

2172
02:49:55,006 --> 02:49:58,607
[SPEAKER_11]: It was actually really good food, but the thing is that they didn't want to let us in because we didn't have badges.

2173
02:49:58,627 --> 02:50:00,228
[SPEAKER_11]: We were like, hey, we won a prize.

2174
02:50:00,848 --> 02:50:01,868
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, okay, you can come in.

2175
02:50:02,909 --> 02:50:04,769
[SPEAKER_37]: Was Adam Curry wearing leather?

2176
02:50:05,790 --> 02:50:11,652
[SPEAKER_11]: No, he was wearing like, like a tux, except he didn't have the jacket or the tie in.

2177
02:50:11,692 --> 02:50:12,952
[SPEAKER_11]: It was sort of unbuttoned at the top.

2178
02:50:13,192 --> 02:50:16,293
[SPEAKER_11]: It was that very casual, dressy look.

2179
02:50:16,413 --> 02:50:18,134
[SPEAKER_32]: What a lazy, lazy bat.

2180
02:50:18,174 --> 02:50:18,634
[SPEAKER_32]: No, I'm kidding.

2181
02:50:19,795 --> 02:50:23,816
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, there were people who were dressed in, you know, like, like,

2182
02:50:24,435 --> 02:50:30,379
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice clothes and then people who were sort of not so nice.

2183
02:50:31,580 --> 02:50:37,084
[SPEAKER_11]: Like people who were wearing like what you wear to like go work out in or something.

2184
02:50:37,384 --> 02:50:41,007
[SPEAKER_32]: Now, you know, if I had gone, I would have dressed fabulously if I had went.

2185
02:50:41,207 --> 02:50:42,308
[SPEAKER_11]: I dressed fabulously.

2186
02:50:42,328 --> 02:50:42,768
[SPEAKER_11]: What did you wear?

2187
02:50:42,788 --> 02:50:43,949
[SPEAKER_11]: I forgot to put on my boots.

2188
02:50:44,730 --> 02:50:46,151
[SPEAKER_32]: Did you wear your angel wings?

2189
02:50:46,971 --> 02:50:47,612
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I didn't.

2190
02:50:47,832 --> 02:50:49,273
[SPEAKER_11]: You forgot to put on your boots.

2191
02:50:49,833 --> 02:50:52,035
[SPEAKER_11]: You know those really hot pants I have?

2192
02:50:52,555 --> 02:50:53,016
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm sorry, what?

2193
02:50:53,644 --> 02:50:53,904
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I did.

2194
02:50:53,924 --> 02:50:54,044
[SPEAKER_11]: I met...

2195
02:51:24,271 --> 02:51:30,435
[SPEAKER_11]: Frank from The Overnightscape, a really cool independent talk show podcast.

2196
02:51:33,297 --> 02:51:37,880
[SPEAKER_11]: I met a few other people from the general New Jersey area, pretty cool folks.

2197
02:51:39,081 --> 02:51:40,141
[SPEAKER_11]: We hung out there for a while.

2198
02:51:40,182 --> 02:51:44,945
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually got interviewed for his podcast as one of the winners.

2199
02:51:45,325 --> 02:51:47,506
[SPEAKER_32]: I wonder if that's aired yet.

2200
02:51:47,546 --> 02:51:48,327
[SPEAKER_32]: We'll have to check that out.

2201
02:51:48,919 --> 02:51:50,821
[SPEAKER_11]: Probably, he does his nightly.

2202
02:51:51,102 --> 02:51:52,764
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh my god, that's a lot.

2203
02:51:53,444 --> 02:51:54,806
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that's a bit much.

2204
02:51:55,547 --> 02:51:55,827
[SPEAKER_32]: I know.

2205
02:51:56,168 --> 02:51:58,130
[SPEAKER_32]: Could you imagine if we tried to do OLR nightly?

2206
02:51:58,170 --> 02:51:58,851
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh my god, we'd die.

2207
02:51:59,104 --> 02:51:59,905
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't have no life

2208
02:52:28,567 --> 02:52:34,189
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright, we're going to open up the Skype line now, but it's the lightning round, kids.

2209
02:52:34,609 --> 02:52:35,689
[SPEAKER_32]: This is the lightning round.

2210
02:52:36,750 --> 02:52:38,070
[SPEAKER_32]: Put in some thunder here.

2211
02:52:38,510 --> 02:52:42,791
[SPEAKER_32]: It's the lightning round of our Skype line being open because you only get two minutes.

2212
02:52:43,612 --> 02:52:45,632
[SPEAKER_32]: Because we're almost out of time.

2213
02:52:45,812 --> 02:52:46,493
[SPEAKER_32]: That's not thunder.

2214
02:52:46,513 --> 02:52:50,234
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, here we go.

2215
02:52:52,726 --> 02:52:53,247
[SPEAKER_32]: That is Bethany.

2216
02:52:53,607 --> 02:52:54,808
[SPEAKER_32]: Hi, you're on Orange Silence Radio.

2217
02:52:55,008 --> 02:52:55,349
[SPEAKER_32]: Hello.

2218
02:52:55,669 --> 02:52:57,310
[SPEAKER_40]: Obviously, I need no introduction.

2219
02:52:57,350 --> 02:52:58,191
[SPEAKER_40]: You already know who this is.

2220
02:52:58,211 --> 02:52:58,532
[SPEAKER_32]: Two minutes, Daku.

2221
02:52:58,552 --> 02:52:59,052
[SPEAKER_40]: Two minutes.

2222
02:52:59,572 --> 02:52:59,973
[SPEAKER_40]: Go.

2223
02:53:00,693 --> 02:53:08,380
[SPEAKER_40]: Alright, basically, when I was in the MTV thing, they are going to be... The DDR player they're going to be doing it on is this cat named Sketch.

2224
02:53:08,701 --> 02:53:09,982
[SPEAKER_40]: He's one of the best players in the industry.

2225
02:53:10,002 --> 02:53:10,763
[SPEAKER_40]: Like, literally a cat?

2226
02:53:11,894 --> 02:53:15,256
[SPEAKER_40]: No, I mean it in a noun way.

2227
02:53:15,276 --> 02:53:17,637
[SPEAKER_40]: Look, there's this DDR player named Sketch.

2228
02:53:17,997 --> 02:53:19,878
[SPEAKER_34]: Okay, I'll stop taking away your minutes.

2229
02:53:19,898 --> 02:53:21,299
[SPEAKER_40]: Go ahead.

2230
02:53:21,759 --> 02:53:22,719
[SPEAKER_32]: He's a freestyler.

2231
02:53:25,000 --> 02:53:25,821
[SPEAKER_32]: No, go ahead.

2232
02:53:26,001 --> 02:53:27,101
[SPEAKER_32]: S versus being a smartass.

2233
02:53:27,121 --> 02:53:29,543
[SPEAKER_32]: Keep talking.

2234
02:53:31,023 --> 02:53:32,124
[SPEAKER_31]: Great, he broke his train.

2235
02:53:34,046 --> 02:53:38,688
[SPEAKER_40]: As I said, all they're really going to focus on is him.

2236
02:53:38,728 --> 02:53:41,910
[SPEAKER_40]: He's the only DDR player that they shine their cameras on.

2237
02:53:42,950 --> 02:53:58,317
[SPEAKER_40]: They just basically asked him a few questions about his playing skills, and apparently they even went as far as making him breakdance on a carpeted floor on the stage.

2238
02:54:00,017 --> 02:54:00,357
[SPEAKER_40]: Okay.

2239
02:54:03,496 --> 02:54:09,250
[SPEAKER_40]: So, pretty much, he will be in an MTV Overdrive special, I think, on Tuesday.

2240
02:54:09,975 --> 02:54:14,696
[SPEAKER_40]: But the segment will probably air this Tuesday, you know, in that episode of Direct Effect.

2241
02:54:14,816 --> 02:54:17,317
[SPEAKER_40]: So... I'm already setting up my TiVo.

2242
02:54:17,337 --> 02:54:19,097
[SPEAKER_40]: You'll definitely get a glimpse of him.

2243
02:54:19,497 --> 02:54:20,358
[SPEAKER_40]: Zach, who am I going to see?

2244
02:54:20,398 --> 02:54:22,578
[SPEAKER_40]: Am I going to see you on the TiVo?

2245
02:54:22,618 --> 02:54:26,379
[SPEAKER_40]: So, you're probably going to be saying... You're probably going to be, you know, TiVo it, I assume.

2246
02:54:27,399 --> 02:54:29,200
[SPEAKER_40]: Yeah, I'm going to TiVo it.

2247
02:54:29,740 --> 02:54:34,361
[SPEAKER_40]: And basically critique it like we always do with other things.

2248
02:54:34,661 --> 02:54:35,001
[SPEAKER_22]: We'll see.

2249
02:54:35,701 --> 02:54:36,402
[SPEAKER_40]: Are you going to be on it?

2250
02:54:36,442 --> 02:54:37,242
[SPEAKER_40]: Another thing, um...

2251
02:54:40,523 --> 02:54:48,166
[SPEAKER_40]: One of the hosts from Direct Effect actually had the gall to walk out of the stage when she refused to do a segment again.

2252
02:54:50,267 --> 02:54:51,707
[SPEAKER_40]: She refused to retake a segment.

2253
02:54:52,588 --> 02:54:58,150
[SPEAKER_40]: Fucking Lala Vasquez, the host of Direct Effect, who was pretty damn clueless about DDR to begin with.

2254
02:54:59,329 --> 02:55:01,192
[SPEAKER_40]: So she was like, what the hell is DDR?

2255
02:55:01,232 --> 02:55:03,034
[SPEAKER_40]: Is that that game with all the... Time's up.

2256
02:55:03,275 --> 02:55:04,837
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, next call.

2257
02:55:05,718 --> 02:55:06,860
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, you're on Orange Science Radio.

2258
02:55:07,040 --> 02:55:07,440
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's this?

2259
02:55:07,661 --> 02:55:08,542
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, this is GS191.

2260
02:55:08,722 --> 02:55:10,264
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, two minutes.

2261
02:55:10,605 --> 02:55:10,905
[SPEAKER_10]: Hurry up.

2262
02:55:10,925 --> 02:55:11,927
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, what's up?

2263
02:55:11,967 --> 02:55:14,130
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, you didn't save my FUs, man.

2264
02:55:14,150 --> 02:55:14,470
[SPEAKER_10]: Jeez.

2265
02:55:14,891 --> 02:55:15,291
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't?

2266
02:55:15,351 --> 02:55:16,213
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.

2267
02:55:17,375 --> 02:55:18,096
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, that's okay, man.

2268
02:55:18,236 --> 02:55:19,477
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you got two minutes.

2269
02:55:19,537 --> 02:55:19,977
[SPEAKER_10]: Go for it.

2270
02:55:20,558 --> 02:55:21,158
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, man.

2271
02:55:21,718 --> 02:55:27,723
[SPEAKER_10]: My FU was Best Buy because I just started there like about a week ago.

2272
02:55:27,743 --> 02:55:28,083
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh-huh.

2273
02:55:28,103 --> 02:55:28,344
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh-huh.

2274
02:55:29,925 --> 02:55:32,026
[SPEAKER_10]: And now they want me to come in at 4 a.m.

2275
02:55:32,067 --> 02:55:33,348
[SPEAKER_10]: in the morning on Black Friday.

2276
02:55:34,268 --> 02:55:34,729
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, my God.

2277
02:55:34,749 --> 02:55:35,910
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you having to work Tuesday?

2278
02:55:36,892 --> 02:55:39,294
[SPEAKER_10]: Tuesday, the Xbox day.

2279
02:55:39,974 --> 02:55:40,494
[SPEAKER_32]: No, I don't.

2280
02:55:40,755 --> 02:55:41,315
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank God.

2281
02:55:41,996 --> 02:55:42,676
[SPEAKER_32]: Yes, yes.

2282
02:55:43,537 --> 02:55:45,318
[SPEAKER_32]: You'd have to come in at like 3 a.m.

2283
02:55:45,698 --> 02:55:49,381
[SPEAKER_32]: to beat people up on the line and stuff or something.

2284
02:55:49,401 --> 02:55:49,721
[SPEAKER_32]: I don't know.

2285
02:55:50,521 --> 02:55:51,082
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah, pretty much.

2286
02:55:52,183 --> 02:55:53,043
[SPEAKER_32]: Anything else you want to share?

2287
02:55:54,444 --> 02:55:55,365
[SPEAKER_32]: No, no, no.

2288
02:55:55,605 --> 02:55:58,147
[SPEAKER_32]: You have a minute ten left before I hang up on you.

2289
02:55:59,167 --> 02:55:59,928
[SPEAKER_32]: I got to go now.

2290
02:56:00,088 --> 02:56:00,448
[SPEAKER_32]: All right.

2291
02:56:00,508 --> 02:56:01,929
[SPEAKER_32]: Well, I want to hang up on you anyway, okay?

2292
02:56:02,590 --> 02:56:02,830
[SPEAKER_32]: All right.

2293
02:56:02,850 --> 02:56:03,490
[SPEAKER_32]: All right, there we go.

2294
02:56:03,750 --> 02:56:04,071
[SPEAKER_32]: All right.

2295
02:56:05,231 --> 02:56:05,852
[SPEAKER_32]: Next up.

2296
02:56:06,809 --> 02:56:08,830
[SPEAKER_32]: Lightning Round, two minutes, what's up, who's this?

2297
02:56:13,312 --> 02:56:14,393
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright, two minutes, what's up?

2298
02:56:15,713 --> 02:56:17,334
[SPEAKER_13]: What is?

2299
02:56:17,594 --> 02:56:17,714
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

2300
02:56:17,774 --> 02:56:19,655
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh yeah, Mario Kart DS is badass, I love it.

2301
02:56:27,575 --> 02:56:27,775
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

2302
02:56:28,856 --> 02:56:31,777
[SPEAKER_32]: And I will get you my friend code, I just, I need a break, so.

2303
02:56:32,478 --> 02:56:32,658
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

2304
02:56:32,678 --> 02:56:33,559
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright.

2305
02:56:33,599 --> 02:56:35,320
[SPEAKER_13]: And Loki, give me your friend code, can't it?

2306
02:56:35,340 --> 02:56:36,840
[SPEAKER_32]: It's on the forums.

2307
02:56:37,121 --> 02:56:38,541
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh yeah, Loki put it on the forums.

2308
02:56:38,842 --> 02:56:42,924
[SPEAKER_32]: OrangeLogsRadio.com He's not, I'm afraid of the stalkers more than he is.

2309
02:56:44,425 --> 02:56:44,725
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

2310
02:56:44,785 --> 02:56:46,426
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright, a minute twenty, what else is on your mind?

2311
02:56:47,386 --> 02:56:50,308
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, I score as a DDL club now, which is like pretty cool.

2312
02:56:51,209 --> 02:56:51,389
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

2313
02:56:52,199 --> 02:56:52,499
[SPEAKER_32]: Cool.

2314
02:56:53,000 --> 02:56:53,540
[SPEAKER_32]: Where's that at?

2315
02:56:54,561 --> 02:56:55,742
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, at my school.

2316
02:56:56,222 --> 02:56:56,563
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright.

2317
02:56:57,083 --> 02:56:58,945
[SPEAKER_32]: Well, is this like high school, college, or what?

2318
02:56:59,425 --> 02:56:59,765
[SPEAKER_32]: High school.

2319
02:57:00,106 --> 02:57:00,786
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright, awesome.

2320
02:57:01,026 --> 02:57:02,027
[SPEAKER_13]: We're in Ohio.

2321
02:57:02,568 --> 02:57:02,848
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay.

2322
02:57:03,488 --> 02:57:06,751
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, and now you can see I've only done a few rounds of DDR.

2323
02:57:06,971 --> 02:57:08,573
[SPEAKER_13]: It's called 3.

2324
02:57:09,013 --> 02:57:09,373
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah.

2325
02:57:09,894 --> 02:57:12,936
[SPEAKER_32]: Are you guys going to be bringing Ultramix 3 into your club?

2326
02:57:14,398 --> 02:57:16,739
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, I really have no clue.

2327
02:57:16,960 --> 02:57:18,341
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright, I thought I'd ask.

2328
02:57:19,110 --> 02:57:21,752
[SPEAKER_13]: Nothing that I really know other than ADR.

2329
02:57:48,157 --> 02:57:52,679
[SPEAKER_32]: What we used to do in high school is we used to order pizza and then do whatever our club thing was.

2330
02:57:52,719 --> 02:57:54,120
[SPEAKER_32]: Do you guys do pizza in DDR?

2331
02:57:55,301 --> 02:57:57,322
[SPEAKER_13]: Not that I know of.

2332
02:57:57,402 --> 02:57:57,902
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, okay.

2333
02:57:58,483 --> 02:58:06,648
[SPEAKER_13]: One thing is I was at two TV saloons, so we didn't have two going on.

2334
02:58:06,888 --> 02:58:07,668
[SPEAKER_32]: And that's two minutes.

2335
02:58:07,929 --> 02:58:08,289
[SPEAKER_32]: All right.

2336
02:58:09,209 --> 02:58:10,370
[SPEAKER_32]: Well, the lightning round's fun.

2337
02:58:10,650 --> 02:58:11,591
[SPEAKER_32]: Jeez, you're a bitch.

2338
02:58:12,788 --> 02:58:14,390
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay, you're going to get off my line right now.

2339
02:58:14,450 --> 02:58:15,511
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay, bye, bye, bye.

2340
02:58:15,911 --> 02:58:19,254
[SPEAKER_32]: I know, and then I talk and take up their whole two minutes, but that's part of the fun of it.

2341
02:58:20,295 --> 02:58:21,576
[SPEAKER_21]: You know what?

2342
02:58:21,696 --> 02:58:28,603
[SPEAKER_32]: The lightning round, I know, I cut Zaku off so bad, I'm so sorry, but I think we need to institute the lightning round every time we do Skype.

2343
02:58:28,663 --> 02:58:29,203
[SPEAKER_32]: That's fun.

2344
02:58:29,844 --> 02:58:30,344
[SPEAKER_32]: It is fun.

2345
02:58:30,685 --> 02:58:31,365
[SPEAKER_32]: See what I love doing?

2346
02:58:31,385 --> 02:58:34,688
[SPEAKER_32]: Do you see how I coaxed him to talk for 30 more seconds just so I could hang up on him?

2347
02:58:38,092 --> 02:58:40,795
[SPEAKER_37]: Yeah, I feel bad, but it's still funny, so you should still do it.

2348
02:58:40,815 --> 02:58:41,656
[SPEAKER_32]: All right, show's over.

2349
02:58:41,836 --> 02:58:42,577
[SPEAKER_32]: Final thoughts.

2350
02:58:42,757 --> 02:58:43,457
[SPEAKER_32]: Lightning round.

2351
02:58:44,018 --> 02:58:45,479

[SPEAKER_32]: And my final thought is, whatever.

2362
02:59:15,864 --> 02:59:17,205
